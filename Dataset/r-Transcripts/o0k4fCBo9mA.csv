o0k4fCBo9mA,0,2159,what's going on minecraft fans my name's
o0k4fCBo9mA,2159,4240,luke the notable welcome to 100 games of
o0k4fCBo9mA,4240,6080,minecraft build battles if you've never
o0k4fCBo9mA,6080,7520,played build battles before i'll give
o0k4fCBo9mA,7520,9440,you a quick rundown it's very simple in
o0k4fCBo9mA,9440,10880,every game of build battles you and
o0k4fCBo9mA,10880,12559,other players are tasked with building
o0k4fCBo9mA,12559,14320,something with a particular theme this
o0k4fCBo9mA,14320,16240,time it was hamburger you've got five
o0k4fCBo9mA,16240,18080,minutes to build the best hamburger or
o0k4fCBo9mA,18080,20240,whatever you can at the end everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,20240,22240,votes on everyone else's and it's very
o0k4fCBo9mA,22240,24000,serious and when the voting's over a
o0k4fCBo9mA,24000,26320,winner is crowned that's it let's get
o0k4fCBo9mA,26320,28720,into game number one so here we are game
o0k4fCBo9mA,28720,30480,one and this time the theme is swing
o0k4fCBo9mA,30480,32078,that's pretty straightforward i guess
o0k4fCBo9mA,32078,34320,like most game ones of all of my hundred
o0k4fCBo9mA,34320,36480,series i was very inexperienced and
o0k4fCBo9mA,36480,38160,after two whole minutes i've made some
o0k4fCBo9mA,38160,40399,grass let's go i put in a basic swing
o0k4fCBo9mA,40399,42320,shape with prismarine cause i panicked
o0k4fCBo9mA,42320,44160,you and i both know this looks terrible
o0k4fCBo9mA,44160,45920,you gotta give me credit in five minutes
o0k4fCBo9mA,45920,47920,in my first game i built a swing in the
o0k4fCBo9mA,47920,49760,most basic sense of the word i came in
o0k4fCBo9mA,49760,52160,dead last but this was my competition
o0k4fCBo9mA,52160,54399,good job that's beautiful all right my
o0k4fCBo9mA,54399,56160,first couple games i'm telling you right
o0k4fCBo9mA,56160,58480,now my builds are pretty awful do not
o0k4fCBo9mA,58480,60160,cringe at me so i'll just go over how
o0k4fCBo9mA,60160,61600,you win at build battles cause there's a
o0k4fCBo9mA,61600,63359,basic formula that works every single
o0k4fCBo9mA,63359,65439,game step one you've gotta follow the
o0k4fCBo9mA,65439,67520,theme if you want good votes this time
o0k4fCBo9mA,67520,69600,the theme was flower i made a flower
o0k4fCBo9mA,69600,71600,check step two you've gotta show off
o0k4fCBo9mA,71600,73680,some sort of skill your build can't look
o0k4fCBo9mA,73680,76320,sloppy it can't look too boxy it has to
o0k4fCBo9mA,76320,78000,impress and i'm telling you your build
o0k4fCBo9mA,78000,80080,will never win unless it has this third
o0k4fCBo9mA,80080,82240,element it needs creativity it's gotta
o0k4fCBo9mA,82240,83759,have something that makes it different
o0k4fCBo9mA,83759,85200,from all the other builds i thought i
o0k4fCBo9mA,85200,86960,did pretty well this time the theme was
o0k4fCBo9mA,86960,88560,flower so i made one of my favorite
o0k4fCBo9mA,88560,90000,flowers in the game and even put a
o0k4fCBo9mA,90000,91840,little bee there unfortunately during
o0k4fCBo9mA,91840,94159,the voting phase mine was first and it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,94159,95920,never good to go first i just always
o0k4fCBo9mA,95920,97520,notice my builds do better when they
o0k4fCBo9mA,97520,99600,follow bad ones sorry whoever made this
o0k4fCBo9mA,99600,101119,didn't matter anyway cause there was no
o0k4fCBo9mA,101119,103200,way i was beating this flower absolutely
o0k4fCBo9mA,103200,105119,magnificent game three i've got five
o0k4fCBo9mA,105119,106720,minutes to make a pie and i've got no
o0k4fCBo9mA,106720,108399,idea what i'm gonna do one element i
o0k4fCBo9mA,108399,110079,liked in this one is i put campfires
o0k4fCBo9mA,110079,111520,underneath the wool to make it look like
o0k4fCBo9mA,111520,113600,the pie was steaming that's nice but in
o0k4fCBo9mA,113600,116399,the end you can tell it just didn't look
o0k4fCBo9mA,116399,118240,right that's not a winning build better
o0k4fCBo9mA,118240,119840,than this guy no offense all art is
o0k4fCBo9mA,119840,122479,beautiful oh man waterfall
o0k4fCBo9mA,122479,124640,it's gonna be bad please make fun of me
o0k4fCBo9mA,124640,126320,for this appalling display i truly
o0k4fCBo9mA,126320,128000,deserve it at this point i knew i wasn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,128000,129679,gonna win but i was hoping i wouldn't be
o0k4fCBo9mA,129679,131599,last it's human nature to feel good when
o0k4fCBo9mA,131599,133120,someone does worse than you now the
o0k4fCBo9mA,133120,134720,theme was paint and i had what i thought
o0k4fCBo9mA,134720,136560,was a very creative idea you only have
o0k4fCBo9mA,136560,138000,five minutes and build battles so you
o0k4fCBo9mA,138000,139280,pretty much have to go with whatever
o0k4fCBo9mA,139280,141520,pops in your head to start good or bad i
o0k4fCBo9mA,141520,143120,built a little room kind of made it look
o0k4fCBo9mA,143120,145040,like a studio apartment you know like a
o0k4fCBo9mA,145040,147040,starving artist's apartment i know it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,147040,148720,not a very good idea it's also important
o0k4fCBo9mA,148720,150239,to know if you have to label what your
o0k4fCBo9mA,150239,152400,build is you have lost guys look it's an
o0k4fCBo9mA,152400,154560,artist's apartment how true to the theme
o0k4fCBo9mA,154560,156480,skillfully built and creative i wasn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,156480,158640,dead last some guy made a tree wasn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,158640,160480,recording for my build game six the
o0k4fCBo9mA,160480,162080,theme was caterpillar and this guy made
o0k4fCBo9mA,162080,163840,a tree so my odds were pretty good this
o0k4fCBo9mA,163840,166080,was mine the pretty famished caterpillar
o0k4fCBo9mA,166080,167599,do you like it well apparently everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,167599,169200,in the lobby liked it because it rained
o0k4fCBo9mA,169200,171360,diamonds i think that's a good sign yep
o0k4fCBo9mA,171360,173040,that got me the win want to thank my
o0k4fCBo9mA,173040,174720,two-year-old for inspiring me with this
o0k4fCBo9mA,174720,176480,one no surprise though it checks all the
o0k4fCBo9mA,176480,178720,boxes fits the theme is skillfully done
o0k4fCBo9mA,178720,180480,and is somewhat creative the theme was
o0k4fCBo9mA,180480,183200,magic game seven it'll be magic if i win
o0k4fCBo9mA,183200,185680,i tried my best to make a wand shooting
o0k4fCBo9mA,185680,187680,a spell oh i should have kept it wood
o0k4fCBo9mA,187680,189920,the obsidian looks so much worse no way
o0k4fCBo9mA,189920,191760,i'm winning against that one flying pig
o0k4fCBo9mA,191760,193360,was the theme for game eight and i had
o0k4fCBo9mA,193360,195200,an idea that i thought might win can you
o0k4fCBo9mA,195200,198080,tell what it is i'll give you a second
o0k4fCBo9mA,198080,200640,it's a pig in a rocket ship but the fact
o0k4fCBo9mA,200640,202480,that i have to explain that to you kind
o0k4fCBo9mA,202480,204480,of shows that it's not great yeah this
o0k4fCBo9mA,204480,205920,is one of those ones that looked a lot
o0k4fCBo9mA,205920,208159,better in my head this guy won for the
o0k4fCBo9mA,208159,210239,record i liked mine better game nine was
o0k4fCBo9mA,210239,212000,slime and i've got an idea that might
o0k4fCBo9mA,212000,213760,shine i was trying to make a humanoid
o0k4fCBo9mA,213760,215519,slime that was wearing diamond armor it
o0k4fCBo9mA,215519,216959,could work i kind of figured everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,216959,218720,else would make a normal slime and mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,218720,220159,would stand out but probably should
o0k4fCBo9mA,220159,221760,cover up his armored poophole i'm proud
o0k4fCBo9mA,221760,224159,of this one it's cute maybe it could be
o0k4fCBo9mA,224159,225440,a little more detailed but it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,225440,227120,definitely funny competition was pretty
o0k4fCBo9mA,227120,229440,bad too this guy just spawned a slime no
o0k4fCBo9mA,229440,230879,no this one here should win look at that
o0k4fCBo9mA,230879,233280,beautiful construction i didn't win this
o0k4fCBo9mA,233280,235680,slime did but you know what it deserves
o0k4fCBo9mA,235680,237680,it the theme for game 10 was moon and
o0k4fCBo9mA,237680,239439,i'm gonna try to make a moon man it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,239439,241280,pretty much the same style as the slime
o0k4fCBo9mA,241280,242799,guy but the other contestants don't know
o0k4fCBo9mA,242799,244480,i just built that yeah it's coming along
o0k4fCBo9mA,244480,246400,well oh probably should delete that it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,246400,248159,a little sus personally i think i did a
o0k4fCBo9mA,248159,249920,wonderful job even if i don't win i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,249920,251840,proud this one
o0k4fCBo9mA,251840,255040,it looks like a banana i was upset bacon
o0k4fCBo9mA,255040,257040,was the theme game 11 and i immediately
o0k4fCBo9mA,257040,260239,got an idea what is bacon it's delicious
o0k4fCBo9mA,260239,262479,but that's because it's dead pig pig's
o0k4fCBo9mA,262479,264400,done with almost three minutes to spare
o0k4fCBo9mA,264400,265919,do you know what i'm doing if you happen
o0k4fCBo9mA,265919,268000,to say constructing a guillotine you've
o0k4fCBo9mA,268000,269919,definitely watched this video before i
o0k4fCBo9mA,269919,271280,haven't had time to install a kill
o0k4fCBo9mA,271280,272960,button redstone doesn't work in build
o0k4fCBo9mA,272960,274720,battles but i wired it up anyway last
o0k4fCBo9mA,274720,276479,thing i did was a curly tail let's just
o0k4fCBo9mA,276479,278080,hope the judges like it it didn't go
o0k4fCBo9mA,278080,279680,first and a lot of other people just
o0k4fCBo9mA,279680,281440,made bacon you may be different but
o0k4fCBo9mA,281440,283520,pixel art doesn't impress me hey this
o0k4fCBo9mA,283520,285280,guy had a similar thought to me he also
o0k4fCBo9mA,285280,287440,made a pig just not well and mine was
o0k4fCBo9mA,287440,289600,right after that's gonna be good oh it
o0k4fCBo9mA,289600,291759,wasn't just good this time it rained
o0k4fCBo9mA,291759,293919,diamonds thank you thank you i'd like to
o0k4fCBo9mA,293919,296000,thank all of my years not being a vegan
o0k4fCBo9mA,296000,297759,igloo's the theme game 12 and i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,297759,299680,telling you right now i went way too big
o0k4fCBo9mA,299680,301360,sure i was ambitious but even if i was
o0k4fCBo9mA,301360,303039,able to pull off an igloo of this size
o0k4fCBo9mA,303039,304720,it's all the same block there's nothing
o0k4fCBo9mA,304720,306639,impressive about that with literally no
o0k4fCBo9mA,306639,308880,time to spare i made a giant igloo with
o0k4fCBo9mA,308880,311280,a giant head inside and not surprisingly
o0k4fCBo9mA,311280,313680,i didn't win theme was hamburger game 13
o0k4fCBo9mA,313680,315199,so i went with my good old strat of
o0k4fCBo9mA,315199,317199,crude comedy made a cow and put him in a
o0k4fCBo9mA,317199,318639,guillotine cause the other players don't
o0k4fCBo9mA,318639,320400,know i just built this looking back i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,320400,322080,glad i didn't win but you know something
o0k4fCBo9mA,322080,323600,about that winning hamburger don't look
o0k4fCBo9mA,323600,325759,right making a teddy bear game 14 and i
o0k4fCBo9mA,325759,327280,think i went too big again that's an
o0k4fCBo9mA,327280,328560,issue i've got to handle yeah at a
o0k4fCBo9mA,328560,330080,certain point i just had to cut my
o0k4fCBo9mA,330080,331840,losses and make a head it was just too
o0k4fCBo9mA,331840,334479,large it looks a little fazberry and
o0k4fCBo9mA,334479,336479,he's missing an arm oh
o0k4fCBo9mA,336479,338720,oh that's that's worse though this looks
o0k4fCBo9mA,338720,340160,like someone killed a teddy bear and
o0k4fCBo9mA,340160,341600,this is the chalk outline i actually
o0k4fCBo9mA,341600,343680,came in second to this one a lot better
o0k4fCBo9mA,343680,346240,than i thought i'd do game 15 was sushi
o0k4fCBo9mA,346240,348000,so you gotta know i'm making a fish and
o0k4fCBo9mA,348000,350000,then depicting it being slayed i spent a
o0k4fCBo9mA,350000,351759,lot of time on the fish probably too
o0k4fCBo9mA,351759,353440,much time but you know what it came out
o0k4fCBo9mA,353440,355120,looking nice i built a knife coming out
o0k4fCBo9mA,355120,356960,of it you get the idea these were my
o0k4fCBo9mA,356960,359919,competitors yes oh yes i definitely see
o0k4fCBo9mA,359919,361680,the sushi here yeah that looks like
o0k4fCBo9mA,361680,364080,sushi that was barfed up six hours later
o0k4fCBo9mA,364080,365440,i know i said i told you how to win
o0k4fCBo9mA,365440,367440,earlier but honestly the best way seems
o0k4fCBo9mA,367440,369440,to be killing stuff flying pig again and
o0k4fCBo9mA,369440,371199,you know what i'm confident in my design
o0k4fCBo9mA,371199,372880,it was good this time i made the rocket
o0k4fCBo9mA,372880,374720,much bigger and spawned a pig inside i
o0k4fCBo9mA,374720,376080,think it's kind of cute wilbur did not
o0k4fCBo9mA,376080,377919,return to earth on his brave mission
o0k4fCBo9mA,377919,380639,rest in peace oh mine went first no way
o0k4fCBo9mA,380639,382400,i'm winning yeah i came in fifth and i
o0k4fCBo9mA,382400,384160,still think mine deserves way better got
o0k4fCBo9mA,384160,386000,the hamburger theme again and this time
o0k4fCBo9mA,386000,387360,decided to be boring and make a
o0k4fCBo9mA,387360,389039,hamburger part of me wishes i just made
o0k4fCBo9mA,389039,390639,the cow guillotine again i think that
o0k4fCBo9mA,390639,392160,would have gone better personally i
o0k4fCBo9mA,392160,393680,liked this one the best i can really
o0k4fCBo9mA,393680,396000,appreciate it but it didn't win game 18
o0k4fCBo9mA,396000,398319,the theme was pool but i made a hot tub
o0k4fCBo9mA,398319,400000,the more you mess with the theme while
o0k4fCBo9mA,400000,401919,staying true to it the better your build
o0k4fCBo9mA,401919,404080,generally does so if the theme is pool
o0k4fCBo9mA,404080,406240,don't make a tree but a hot tub that's
o0k4fCBo9mA,406240,408240,fair game this one just spawned water
o0k4fCBo9mA,408240,410720,good job sir your uh your pool seems to
o0k4fCBo9mA,410720,412319,be leaking most of the other builds were
o0k4fCBo9mA,412319,414479,just kind of uninspired big blocks with
o0k4fCBo9mA,414479,417039,water in them got the win i deserved it
o0k4fCBo9mA,417039,418800,i mean look at that hot tub i'd take a
o0k4fCBo9mA,418800,420880,dip game 19 the theme was octopus so i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,420880,422880,gonna make an octopus die first thing i
o0k4fCBo9mA,422880,424720,worked on was the octopus tentacle
o0k4fCBo9mA,424720,426240,that's the theme it's gotta look good
o0k4fCBo9mA,426240,427840,then i made a big old butcher knife
o0k4fCBo9mA,427840,429199,cutting through it i think this build
o0k4fCBo9mA,429199,431039,would work with the sushi theme too it
o0k4fCBo9mA,431039,432479,looked great and i had about a minute
o0k4fCBo9mA,432479,434639,left so i tried to make an octopus head
o0k4fCBo9mA,434639,436800,100 i went wrong doing that when you
o0k4fCBo9mA,436800,438319,look at both sides you can tell there's
o0k4fCBo9mA,438319,440560,a dip in quality and my competition was
o0k4fCBo9mA,440560,442160,good i mean look at that build it's like
o0k4fCBo9mA,442160,444160,the kraken game 20 i've got to make a
o0k4fCBo9mA,444160,445840,firework but didn't have any insane
o0k4fCBo9mA,445840,447759,ideas so i just tried to make a pixel
o0k4fCBo9mA,447759,449840,perfect minecraft firework it's not very
o0k4fCBo9mA,449840,451520,creative but if it's done well it could
o0k4fCBo9mA,451520,453440,win i got done sooner than i thought and
o0k4fCBo9mA,453440,455280,i added some comedic flair clarence the
o0k4fCBo9mA,455280,457520,creeper was launched into space never to
o0k4fCBo9mA,457520,460080,be seen again but he wanted it that way
o0k4fCBo9mA,460080,461759,not bad let's see what my enemies have
o0k4fCBo9mA,461759,462960,to offer
o0k4fCBo9mA,462960,465440,okay decent i guess doesn't look right
o0k4fCBo9mA,465440,467919,pixel art gross ooh thick i think mine's
o0k4fCBo9mA,467919,470319,the best which one do you think won
o0k4fCBo9mA,470319,472560,i don't agree with that at all but it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,472560,474479,art who are we to judge had to make an
o0k4fCBo9mA,474479,477039,astronaut game 21 and i gotta say i went
o0k4fCBo9mA,477039,479680,way way too big i got it done i just had
o0k4fCBo9mA,479680,481840,no time for detail and details will get
o0k4fCBo9mA,481840,484400,you the win not bad but very plain this
o0k4fCBo9mA,484400,486479,build one it's a little simple but i can
o0k4fCBo9mA,486479,487680,see what they were doing here now
o0k4fCBo9mA,487680,489360,treehouse was the theme and i kind of
o0k4fCBo9mA,489360,490720,just want to get this one over with
o0k4fCBo9mA,490720,492479,because it didn't look very good with
o0k4fCBo9mA,492479,494879,one second to spare i got the roof done
o0k4fCBo9mA,494879,496560,but even so it was on two different
o0k4fCBo9mA,496560,498400,levels no one really built anything
o0k4fCBo9mA,498400,499919,great even the winner wasn't very
o0k4fCBo9mA,499919,502319,spectacular game 23 was tank and i was
o0k4fCBo9mA,502319,503919,gonna have some fun with this one the
o0k4fCBo9mA,503919,506080,outside wasn't amazing mostly because i
o0k4fCBo9mA,506080,508160,only used two colors however you could
o0k4fCBo9mA,508160,510080,enter my tank and i want to point out it
o0k4fCBo9mA,510080,511759,was the only one where you could do this
o0k4fCBo9mA,511759,513599,and after putting a few war pigs down
o0k4fCBo9mA,513599,515440,there i thought my victory was assured
o0k4fCBo9mA,515440,517039,entering the tank did not impress the
o0k4fCBo9mA,517039,519120,voters but i'm proud of it game 24 i
o0k4fCBo9mA,519120,521039,made bell pixel art because i literally
o0k4fCBo9mA,521039,523760,had no other idea mine was also voted on
o0k4fCBo9mA,523760,525440,first i didn't really want to win with
o0k4fCBo9mA,525440,528160,pixel art i don't deserve it this one i
o0k4fCBo9mA,528160,529519,don't really like it
o0k4fCBo9mA,529519,532320,or get it what's with the ice game 25
o0k4fCBo9mA,532320,534640,was hot air balloon and honestly to me
o0k4fCBo9mA,534640,536480,that sounded boring you're never gonna
o0k4fCBo9mA,536480,537920,win if you don't dare to do something
o0k4fCBo9mA,537920,540000,interesting it may not work out but it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,540000,542000,worth the risk this is a hot air balloon
o0k4fCBo9mA,542000,543920,crash i hope they get it a regular hot
o0k4fCBo9mA,543920,546240,air balloon one sometimes being creative
o0k4fCBo9mA,546240,548640,is pointless game 26 theme was cloud and
o0k4fCBo9mA,548640,550240,i thought i had a good idea i'm not
o0k4fCBo9mA,550240,551839,gonna explain to you what it is because
o0k4fCBo9mA,551839,554160,if i do that it's certified not good do
o0k4fCBo9mA,554160,556560,you know i'll give you a second
o0k4fCBo9mA,556560,558640,no one knew what i made i came in nearly
o0k4fCBo9mA,558640,560480,last trying to make an accurate tennis
o0k4fCBo9mA,560480,562880,court game 27 might help if i actually
o0k4fCBo9mA,562880,565279,played tennis it looks right i'm not an
o0k4fCBo9mA,565279,567519,expert let's see what everyone else did
o0k4fCBo9mA,567519,569279,that's pretty bad that's foursquare
o0k4fCBo9mA,569279,570880,why'd you make a teddy bear yeah that
o0k4fCBo9mA,570880,572399,one i kind of like this one's a little
o0k4fCBo9mA,572399,574800,too simple this one too there's no lines
o0k4fCBo9mA,574800,577040,nice shading it's just small eh that's
o0k4fCBo9mA,577040,579279,pixel art oh very good that's like the
o0k4fCBo9mA,579279,580959,best one yeah i kinda figured the big
o0k4fCBo9mA,580959,582800,tennis racket would win i came in third
o0k4fCBo9mA,582800,584800,that's fair theme was now fire and i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,584800,587120,not doing anything crazy just taking my
o0k4fCBo9mA,587120,589360,time with shading i layered in orange
o0k4fCBo9mA,589360,591519,yellow and red with tiny bits of blue to
o0k4fCBo9mA,591519,593279,make a nice fire it looked like it had a
o0k4fCBo9mA,593279,594959,lot of love and sometimes that's all you
o0k4fCBo9mA,594959,596880,need mine was simply the most notable
o0k4fCBo9mA,596880,597920,and i'm showing you all of the
o0k4fCBo9mA,597920,599839,contestants to prove it i won even
o0k4fCBo9mA,599839,601600,though i was missing a block on the side
o0k4fCBo9mA,601600,603200,there did you notice that angel was the
o0k4fCBo9mA,603200,605440,theme game 29 and i decided to do it a
o0k4fCBo9mA,605440,606800,little bit differently i gave the
o0k4fCBo9mA,606800,608880,players a choice vote legendary and
o0k4fCBo9mA,608880,611600,reach nirvana vote poop and burn they
o0k4fCBo9mA,611600,613839,voted poop never tell the judges what to
o0k4fCBo9mA,613839,616720,do not sure why campfire and fire are
o0k4fCBo9mA,616720,618880,both different categories but whatever
o0k4fCBo9mA,618880,621040,we got campfire i built a little morsel
o0k4fCBo9mA,621040,622880,of meat on the top of my fire design i
o0k4fCBo9mA,622880,624640,think it looks nice however the brown
o0k4fCBo9mA,624640,626959,poo fire was victorious good job teddy
o0k4fCBo9mA,626959,629920,bear time team 31 yeah probably should
o0k4fCBo9mA,629920,631680,have gone bigger i'm done and i've got
o0k4fCBo9mA,631680,633200,three minutes left messed with some
o0k4fCBo9mA,633200,635040,colors made him cross-eyed that could be
o0k4fCBo9mA,635040,636640,good or bad for me it's better than this
o0k4fCBo9mA,636640,638240,guy's teddy bear cause this guy's teddy
o0k4fCBo9mA,638240,640240,bear is a palm tree no surprise the
o0k4fCBo9mA,640240,643040,fazbear one game 32 was self-portrait
o0k4fCBo9mA,643040,644800,and i'm gonna do my profile picture i
o0k4fCBo9mA,644800,646880,don't really like pixel art but i didn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,646880,648480,have a better idea so this is what i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,648480,650000,going with i think it's pretty good but
o0k4fCBo9mA,650000,653120,i'm also me so i'm very biased fantastic
o0k4fCBo9mA,653120,656079,self-portrait really very well done time
o0k4fCBo9mA,656079,658160,to make a tiger game 33 and you gotta
o0k4fCBo9mA,658160,659680,know i'm about to kill it i wasn't sure
o0k4fCBo9mA,659680,661360,i could make a good tiger but i was
o0k4fCBo9mA,661360,663440,pretty sure i could make a bad tiger die
o0k4fCBo9mA,663440,665120,first thing i did was a tiger laying on
o0k4fCBo9mA,665120,666560,the ground because if i ran out of time
o0k4fCBo9mA,666560,668000,at least i'd have that then i put a
o0k4fCBo9mA,668000,669920,sword in him who knows that could work
o0k4fCBo9mA,669920,672240,really good tiger my man you just blew
o0k4fCBo9mA,672240,674640,it out of the park uh
o0k4fCBo9mA,674640,676800,did what not sure what it is but
o0k4fCBo9mA,676800,678320,something about that doesn't look right
o0k4fCBo9mA,678320,680800,this giant tiger head won there it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,680800,683360,pretty good game 34 the theme was baby
o0k4fCBo9mA,683360,685200,and if you ever play build battles don't
o0k4fCBo9mA,685200,687360,do what i'm about to do not sure why but
o0k4fCBo9mA,687360,689360,i didn't feel like making a baby so i
o0k4fCBo9mA,689360,690480,thought i'd do something a little
o0k4fCBo9mA,690480,692399,different i made a long room with a sign
o0k4fCBo9mA,692399,693839,that says you if you don't vote
o0k4fCBo9mA,693839,695680,legendary implying that if they don't
o0k4fCBo9mA,695680,697600,vote me good for my terrible build that
o0k4fCBo9mA,697600,699279,they are a baby don't ever do anything
o0k4fCBo9mA,699279,701760,like this it won't work you're not funny
o0k4fCBo9mA,701760,703760,neither am i i came in dead last baby
o0k4fCBo9mA,703760,706079,yoda won next game now the theme is
o0k4fCBo9mA,706079,708399,pyramid and i went wrong by not building
o0k4fCBo9mA,708399,710720,a pyramid i built two pyramids on top of
o0k4fCBo9mA,710720,712240,each other which i thought was a good
o0k4fCBo9mA,712240,714480,idea but now that i look at it it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,714480,716079,kinda lazy all right maybe one more
o0k4fCBo9mA,716079,717839,pyramid on top that'll do it i came in
o0k4fCBo9mA,717839,719200,dead last because i didn't build a
o0k4fCBo9mA,719200,721519,pyramid it's also all one block there's
o0k4fCBo9mA,721519,723519,nothing good about that game 36 the
o0k4fCBo9mA,723519,725360,theme was game how you like that because
o0k4fCBo9mA,725360,727440,i'm creative i decided to make an actual
o0k4fCBo9mA,727440,729279,game this is my jump course it ain't
o0k4fCBo9mA,729279,730639,much but i didn't want to make it so
o0k4fCBo9mA,730639,732079,long that people weren't able to finish
o0k4fCBo9mA,732079,733760,it and i think it turned out pretty fun
o0k4fCBo9mA,733760,735440,like i thought many people just made
o0k4fCBo9mA,735440,736880,pixel art of different video game
o0k4fCBo9mA,736880,738720,characters i also want to point out mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,738720,740399,was the only playable game and it warmed
o0k4fCBo9mA,740399,742000,my heart to see people trying it big
o0k4fCBo9mA,742000,743839,mario won but i really didn't deserve
o0k4fCBo9mA,743839,745440,eight what's that about aim was just
o0k4fCBo9mA,745440,747680,house game 37 i'm sure i and everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,747680,749200,else will find a way to mess that up i
o0k4fCBo9mA,749200,751200,was going for log cabin and having the
o0k4fCBo9mA,751200,753200,intersecting logs took a lot of time
o0k4fCBo9mA,753200,754880,more than i thought spent a lot of time
o0k4fCBo9mA,754880,756480,on the interior before finishing the
o0k4fCBo9mA,756480,758480,exterior that was dumb well looks like
o0k4fCBo9mA,758480,760560,my house is gonna be ruthless awesome
o0k4fCBo9mA,760560,763279,look at that house oh it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,763279,766079,it's beautiful it's so beautiful i think
o0k4fCBo9mA,766079,767839,the dirt shack just connected with us
o0k4fCBo9mA,767839,769839,we've all been there game 38 was race
o0k4fCBo9mA,769839,772320,car and i kinda just made a car i mean
o0k4fCBo9mA,772320,774480,it looks fast but not really a race car
o0k4fCBo9mA,774480,776720,yeah see a race car won i did good
o0k4fCBo9mA,776720,779040,though i'm proud game 39 was igloo mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,779040,780959,was bad that is all and i only have the
o0k4fCBo9mA,780959,782720,winning footage for game 40. it was
o0k4fCBo9mA,782720,785600,slime and this guy killed us all game 41
o0k4fCBo9mA,785600,787680,was thrown a win or lose i'm gonna have
o0k4fCBo9mA,787680,789519,fun with this one i spent a lot of time
o0k4fCBo9mA,789519,791120,tearing down what i had already built
o0k4fCBo9mA,791120,792800,which is not a good strategy in build
o0k4fCBo9mA,792800,794480,battles you gotta find an idea and stick
o0k4fCBo9mA,794480,796320,with it everyone else's was much better
o0k4fCBo9mA,796320,798240,but i really liked that theme it was fun
o0k4fCBo9mA,798240,800720,game 42 the theme was pyramid and i went
o0k4fCBo9mA,800720,804240,way way way too big too many blocks too
o0k4fCBo9mA,804240,806320,much detail and just not enough time it
o0k4fCBo9mA,806320,808320,was all bumpy and had a really big hole
o0k4fCBo9mA,808320,809760,just like your mom i'm gonna give you
o0k4fCBo9mA,809760,811360,all a second to recover from that one
o0k4fCBo9mA,811360,813600,while i build a pogo stick
o0k4fCBo9mA,813600,815279,i'm trying to put a guy on there too
o0k4fCBo9mA,815279,816480,because i figured a lot of people would
o0k4fCBo9mA,816480,818240,just do this stick and i'll beat them i
o0k4fCBo9mA,818240,819920,finished with three seconds left and i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,819920,821440,really happy with how that turned out i
o0k4fCBo9mA,821440,823600,lost to a regular pogo stick i mean it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,823600,825680,nice and all but there's no person i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,825680,828000,so sorry but the footage is super laggy
o0k4fCBo9mA,828000,830639,for game 44 theme spaceship came in
o0k4fCBo9mA,830639,832320,second let's go to the next one this
o0k4fCBo9mA,832320,834639,hurts my eyes got some smooth footage of
o0k4fCBo9mA,834639,836800,me building a shaded sun after putting
o0k4fCBo9mA,836800,838399,on his little smirk i already loved him
o0k4fCBo9mA,838399,840560,but he needs some solar flares i used
o0k4fCBo9mA,840560,842560,every second available to make this
o0k4fCBo9mA,842560,844320,thing awesome and i definitely did the
o0k4fCBo9mA,844320,846000,builds that go down to the last second
o0k4fCBo9mA,846000,848079,are either really good or really bad
o0k4fCBo9mA,848079,850240,game 46 i'm making a bird i'm trying to
o0k4fCBo9mA,850240,852320,do a minecraft parrot very technically i
o0k4fCBo9mA,852320,853920,wasn't able to think of a more creative
o0k4fCBo9mA,853920,855680,idea but if i can get a pixel perfect
o0k4fCBo9mA,855680,858079,parrot i'll get good votes it's solid no
o0k4fCBo9mA,858079,860320,creative elements but it could still win
o0k4fCBo9mA,860320,862079,it was close but i came in second to
o0k4fCBo9mA,862079,864880,this absolutely gigantic eyeless bird i
o0k4fCBo9mA,864880,866320,don't agree wasn't recording for the
o0k4fCBo9mA,866320,868480,build but made a castle i'll be honest i
o0k4fCBo9mA,868480,870480,don't really like it somehow i came in
o0k4fCBo9mA,870480,872560,second sometimes the voting can be weird
o0k4fCBo9mA,872560,874959,campfire again game 48 i'm not sure how
o0k4fCBo9mA,874959,876639,many times i'm gonna have to make a fire
o0k4fCBo9mA,876639,878000,in this video but it's getting old
o0k4fCBo9mA,878000,879519,already i didn't really change anything
o0k4fCBo9mA,879519,881519,from how i normally do it just did good
o0k4fCBo9mA,881519,883199,shading fire's one of those themes where
o0k4fCBo9mA,883199,884800,everyone's kind of looks the same i got
o0k4fCBo9mA,884800,887040,12. i don't think i deserved that game
o0k4fCBo9mA,887040,889920,49 was drill and i have zero idea what
o0k4fCBo9mA,889920,892160,to do oh yeah i think we can all agree
o0k4fCBo9mA,892160,893760,that that looks terrible what gets me
o0k4fCBo9mA,893760,895360,about the winner here is that it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,895360,897519,mostly just a person the drill is like
o0k4fCBo9mA,897519,900000,five blocks a bucket though i can make a
o0k4fCBo9mA,900000,901600,bucket the plan was to trim it out as
o0k4fCBo9mA,901600,903360,good as i could using many many many
o0k4fCBo9mA,903360,904880,different blocks i was even able to get
o0k4fCBo9mA,904880,906720,a hand holding the bucket though i'm not
o0k4fCBo9mA,906720,908720,sure if this adds or takes away from it
o0k4fCBo9mA,908720,911600,standard it looks more like a cup no
o0k4fCBo9mA,911600,914320,no simple small and leaking ew pixel art
o0k4fCBo9mA,914320,916399,same that one's not bad that one's
o0k4fCBo9mA,916399,918399,pretty good quite a lot of detail i came
o0k4fCBo9mA,918399,920240,in fifth place i have no idea how four
o0k4fCBo9mA,920240,922000,of those buckets were ahead of me game
o0k4fCBo9mA,922000,924399,51 the theme was b so i wanted to try my
o0k4fCBo9mA,924399,926399,strat of putting a b in diamond armor it
o0k4fCBo9mA,926399,928800,ain't perfect a little uncanny even but
o0k4fCBo9mA,928800,930720,you know it's probably the most creative
o0k4fCBo9mA,930720,932079,oh i shouldn't have put the helmet on
o0k4fCBo9mA,932079,933440,that just made it look bad a very
o0k4fCBo9mA,933440,935759,technical b1 i can't deny it looks good
o0k4fCBo9mA,935759,938000,game 52 the theme is mouse and you gotta
o0k4fCBo9mA,938000,939600,know that i'm gonna kill it i decided
o0k4fCBo9mA,939600,941360,not to kill it instead alluded to its
o0k4fCBo9mA,941360,944079,imminent demise ah got voted on first
o0k4fCBo9mA,944079,947120,and i worked so hard i lost by one point
o0k4fCBo9mA,947120,948639,and i can't help but think that if i
o0k4fCBo9mA,948639,950320,didn't go first i would have won wasn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,950320,952240,recording for the building of game 53
o0k4fCBo9mA,952240,954399,here's my castle i spent most of my time
o0k4fCBo9mA,954399,956320,on the lava moat the inside suffered
o0k4fCBo9mA,956320,958240,because of it i'm not gonna win wow two
o0k4fCBo9mA,958240,959680,in a row where i didn't record the
o0k4fCBo9mA,959680,961839,building here's my snake do you like it
o0k4fCBo9mA,961839,964000,surprisingly saw seven or so swell
o0k4fCBo9mA,964000,966320,serpents this snake won and i don't
o0k4fCBo9mA,966320,968320,wanna be rude here but it didn't deserve
o0k4fCBo9mA,968320,970639,it uh three in a row i have not recorded
o0k4fCBo9mA,970639,973279,the building process here is my baby i
o0k4fCBo9mA,973279,974720,didn't see a single other one that
o0k4fCBo9mA,974720,976560,impressed me why is he purple does he
o0k4fCBo9mA,976560,980079,have a disease oh that's a baby car yep
o0k4fCBo9mA,980079,982399,i'm losing as soon as i saw it i knew it
o0k4fCBo9mA,982399,984160,would win but i came in second i'll take
o0k4fCBo9mA,984160,986320,it hey look at me recording me building
o0k4fCBo9mA,986320,988240,something i'm actually doing my job
o0k4fCBo9mA,988240,990720,theme was cloud i made a cloud that's
o0k4fCBo9mA,990720,992160,kind of the point it came out pretty
o0k4fCBo9mA,992160,993680,good i think this is going to depend on
o0k4fCBo9mA,993680,995199,the other players most of the others
o0k4fCBo9mA,995199,997279,were pretty boring just clouds and that
o0k4fCBo9mA,997279,998880,won't get you the win however it will
o0k4fCBo9mA,998880,1000560,get me the wins and i want to say my
o0k4fCBo9mA,1000560,1002399,two-year-old inspired this one too game
o0k4fCBo9mA,1002399,1005040,57 was campsite and i really had no idea
o0k4fCBo9mA,1005040,1006800,how to make it magnificent i did what i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1006800,1008320,thought everyone else was going to do
o0k4fCBo9mA,1008320,1010480,some tents villagers trees normal
o0k4fCBo9mA,1010480,1012480,campsite stuff and just as i thought
o0k4fCBo9mA,1012480,1014320,everyone's campsite looked the same it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1014320,1016320,was a 12-way tie for first the winner
o0k4fCBo9mA,1016320,1017839,looked like everyone else's i don't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1017839,1019839,really like that theme game 58 i've
o0k4fCBo9mA,1019839,1021360,gotta make a camera and i went with a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1021360,1023519,video camera it had a leather strap
o0k4fCBo9mA,1023519,1025918,working viewfinder and a scene preview
o0k4fCBo9mA,1025918,1027760,though from the front it looked a little
o0k4fCBo9mA,1027760,1030000,funky i came in nearly last which i do
o0k4fCBo9mA,1030000,1031678,not think i deserved wasn't recording
o0k4fCBo9mA,1031678,1033678,for the building of game 59 but i took
o0k4fCBo9mA,1033678,1035280,the time to get the replay footage
o0k4fCBo9mA,1035280,1036880,didn't know i could do that until now
o0k4fCBo9mA,1036880,1038880,the theme was bottle so i made a ship in
o0k4fCBo9mA,1038880,1040640,a bottle here's a good tip though i made
o0k4fCBo9mA,1040640,1042720,the ship first so the scale was right if
o0k4fCBo9mA,1042720,1044079,i made the bottle first it could have
o0k4fCBo9mA,1044079,1045600,been way off but in the end it looked
o0k4fCBo9mA,1045600,1047600,perfect everyone else just made bottles
o0k4fCBo9mA,1047600,1049679,not bad but not interesting got the win
o0k4fCBo9mA,1049679,1051440,for my ship in a bottle i'm telling you
o0k4fCBo9mA,1051440,1053679,it's all about creativity it really is
o0k4fCBo9mA,1053679,1055840,so when the theme cave came up i wanted
o0k4fCBo9mA,1055840,1058000,to be really creative i made an insanely
o0k4fCBo9mA,1058000,1060480,large cave with a cave monster inside i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1060480,1062080,guarantee no one else is doing that but
o0k4fCBo9mA,1062080,1064880,it was insanely large too large even
o0k4fCBo9mA,1064880,1066880,that's not a very good monster everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,1066880,1069120,lost to a pile of dirt that's definitely
o0k4fCBo9mA,1069120,1070880,not a cave so i wasn't recording for the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1070880,1072559,building of this one but the theme was
o0k4fCBo9mA,1072559,1074320,chicken how do you like me regardless of
o0k4fCBo9mA,1074320,1076240,what you think it could be worse is his
o0k4fCBo9mA,1076240,1078880,head backwards who made this got that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1078880,1080400,wind pretty easily but i mean look at
o0k4fCBo9mA,1080400,1081919,that you can't deny it's a great build
o0k4fCBo9mA,1081919,1083440,all right here we go cave again we're
o0k4fCBo9mA,1083440,1085200,gonna improve on my previous design to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1085200,1087039,help with my time management i decided
o0k4fCBo9mA,1087039,1088640,to build the monster first and put the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1088640,1090559,cave around him it still took almost all
o0k4fCBo9mA,1090559,1092080,of my time to get this set up but you
o0k4fCBo9mA,1092080,1093679,can't say i wasn't creative the other
o0k4fCBo9mA,1093679,1095600,caves were standard i had hopes that i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1095600,1097440,would win like this one it's so simple
o0k4fCBo9mA,1097440,1098799,and small who would ever vote for that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1098799,1100559,to win apparently the whole lobby would
o0k4fCBo9mA,1100559,1102720,vote for that to win whatever next game
o0k4fCBo9mA,1102720,1104480,where the theme is boot i just tried to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1104480,1106160,make some nice looking shoes that idiots
o0k4fCBo9mA,1106160,1108720,would pay 700 for yeah everyone pretty
o0k4fCBo9mA,1108720,1110880,much had the same idea as me just make a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1110880,1112640,shoe it's anyone's game i lost to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1112640,1114640,spongebob's shoe and i'm okay with that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1114640,1116080,wasn't recording for the building i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1116080,1117600,really gotta stop doing that but the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1117600,1119919,theme was pyramid here's mine and mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,1119919,1122320,got voted on first awesome i'm going to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1122320,1124000,show you all of the other pyramids
o0k4fCBo9mA,1124000,1125760,because i will tell you right now that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1125760,1128400,mine was the best and deserved to win
o0k4fCBo9mA,1128400,1130880,but however it did not i will use this
o0k4fCBo9mA,1130880,1133679,deep emotional pain to make better art
o0k4fCBo9mA,1133679,1135840,camera was the theme and mine was the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1135840,1137919,best it looked like a camera sure but it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1137919,1139760,also showed what it was taking a picture
o0k4fCBo9mA,1139760,1140960,of and if you look through the little
o0k4fCBo9mA,1140960,1142720,viewfinder you can even see the sheep in
o0k4fCBo9mA,1142720,1144799,the picture that's nice unfortunately
o0k4fCBo9mA,1144799,1146880,mine was voted on first so you know it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,1146880,1148480,not gonna win the other builds were
o0k4fCBo9mA,1148480,1150320,simple used maybe one of the elements
o0k4fCBo9mA,1150320,1152640,that i employed however a pixel art one
o0k4fCBo9mA,1152640,1154799,society just doesn't get me theme was i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1154799,1156880,game 66 and i decided to make a big
o0k4fCBo9mA,1156880,1158880,floating eyeball when i made the iris
o0k4fCBo9mA,1158880,1160799,the scale was off but i had time to fix
o0k4fCBo9mA,1160799,1162559,it yeah i'm happy with that even put the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1162559,1164320,little red bit in the back i enjoyed
o0k4fCBo9mA,1164320,1166000,this build the best but even that didn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1166000,1168080,win the winner was decent i'll say the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1168080,1170000,iris is a little uninspired looks like
o0k4fCBo9mA,1170000,1172240,we're still doing anatomy game 67 and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1172240,1173760,today it's a heart i knew for a fact
o0k4fCBo9mA,1173760,1175280,everyone was just gonna make a heart but
o0k4fCBo9mA,1175280,1177120,mine will be anatomical i had so much
o0k4fCBo9mA,1177120,1178799,time i was able to put in some shading
o0k4fCBo9mA,1178799,1180640,blocks to really make that heart pop
o0k4fCBo9mA,1180640,1182320,just as i thought everyone else in the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1182320,1184240,lobby just made valentine's hearts
o0k4fCBo9mA,1184240,1185919,remember it took this player five
o0k4fCBo9mA,1185919,1187280,minutes to build that all right that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1187280,1188960,one's pretty good i can appreciate some
o0k4fCBo9mA,1188960,1190960,villager love a googly eyed heart with
o0k4fCBo9mA,1190960,1193120,wings one i don't even know anymore game
o0k4fCBo9mA,1193120,1195760,68 the theme was lunchbox and similar to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1195760,1197679,my bottle strategy i'm going to make the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1197679,1200000,contents first i made a burger and a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1200000,1202240,juice box which is technically a lunch
o0k4fCBo9mA,1202240,1204159,not a very healthy one then i made the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1204159,1206000,rest of the lunch box around it and it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1206000,1208320,wasn't even that detailed but the scale
o0k4fCBo9mA,1208320,1210159,was spot on yeah and it really showed in
o0k4fCBo9mA,1210159,1212000,the voting some boxes the food didn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1212000,1213919,look right some boxes there was no food
o0k4fCBo9mA,1213919,1217360,at all but one box was just right
o0k4fCBo9mA,1217360,1220320,i won game 69 the theme was spring the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1220320,1222720,season of new life and mating perfect i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1222720,1224559,might be biting off more than i can chew
o0k4fCBo9mA,1224559,1226559,but i'm trying to make two bunnies doing
o0k4fCBo9mA,1226559,1228720,what bunnies do listen chill out they're
o0k4fCBo9mA,1228720,1231039,just kissing don't take my hands away i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1231039,1232880,had virtually no time left because it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1232880,1234960,was a big project but i got it done and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1234960,1236880,that looks nice oh good job dude you
o0k4fCBo9mA,1236880,1238799,spawned flowers on the ground wow this
o0k4fCBo9mA,1238799,1240320,guy made trees
o0k4fCBo9mA,1240320,1242880,that is definitely fall not spring in
o0k4fCBo9mA,1242880,1244720,five minutes he spawned three trees and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1244720,1246880,placed two types of flowers nice bunny
o0k4fCBo9mA,1246880,1248960,love smashed the competition and that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1248960,1251919,would be two wins in a row on game 69 i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1251919,1254240,was happy now the theme was dinosaur and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1254240,1255840,the thought of three wins in a row was
o0k4fCBo9mA,1255840,1257760,driving me to greatness just from the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1257760,1259760,size of the feet it was already a huge
o0k4fCBo9mA,1259760,1261520,build so i had to work fast it took me
o0k4fCBo9mA,1261520,1263120,about three minutes to get the basic
o0k4fCBo9mA,1263120,1264960,shape done but the most important part
o0k4fCBo9mA,1264960,1266559,is definitely the head in this video
o0k4fCBo9mA,1266559,1267760,i've gotten a lot of practice with
o0k4fCBo9mA,1267760,1269120,monster heads though so it formed
o0k4fCBo9mA,1269120,1271280,quickly i was fast had a whole minute at
o0k4fCBo9mA,1271280,1272960,the end for trim work to make this guy
o0k4fCBo9mA,1272960,1274559,really pop you know when i first started
o0k4fCBo9mA,1274559,1276480,this video if you told me that i would
o0k4fCBo9mA,1276480,1278080,build something like that in five
o0k4fCBo9mA,1278080,1279520,minutes i wouldn't believe you
o0k4fCBo9mA,1279520,1281440,competition was tragic this guy didn't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1281440,1283039,have enough time headless dinosaur ain't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1283039,1284480,gonna cut it hey this one might not be
o0k4fCBo9mA,1284480,1285919,the most detailed but at least it's got
o0k4fCBo9mA,1285919,1288720,a head oh the cyclopsosaur my favorite i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1288720,1290240,had double the points of everyone else
o0k4fCBo9mA,1290240,1291919,won that game easily and like i said
o0k4fCBo9mA,1291919,1293760,earlier i'm very proud of myself i never
o0k4fCBo9mA,1293760,1295039,could imagine that i'd build anything
o0k4fCBo9mA,1295039,1296640,this great and especially in only five
o0k4fCBo9mA,1296640,1299039,minutes gonna build a bridge game 71 i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1299039,1300799,like this theme cause the possibilities
o0k4fCBo9mA,1300799,1301919,are endless i don't know what i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1301919,1304000,talking about it's art the possibilities
o0k4fCBo9mA,1304000,1305840,are always endless i barely got this
o0k4fCBo9mA,1305840,1307280,thing done but at the end of the five
o0k4fCBo9mA,1307280,1309039,minutes it was complete like pretty much
o0k4fCBo9mA,1309039,1310559,all of these build battles games there
o0k4fCBo9mA,1310559,1312080,were some that were really good some
o0k4fCBo9mA,1312080,1313600,that were really bad and some that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1313600,1315280,weren't related to bridges at all dice
o0k4fCBo9mA,1315280,1316880,is now the theme and i'm just gonna make
o0k4fCBo9mA,1316880,1318640,some big ones one of the dice i wanted
o0k4fCBo9mA,1318640,1320320,to put on its side so it looked like it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1320320,1322240,was rolling it's ambitious but it could
o0k4fCBo9mA,1322240,1324240,look great got it all done with no time
o0k4fCBo9mA,1324240,1325919,left let's see if the judges appreciate
o0k4fCBo9mA,1325919,1328159,it wow that's really good dice whoever
o0k4fCBo9mA,1328159,1330240,made this is a master i came in second
o0k4fCBo9mA,1330240,1332240,to someone who made three dice and i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1332240,1334559,cried after footage for game 73 is
o0k4fCBo9mA,1334559,1336480,really laggy i'm not sure why but the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1336480,1338080,theme was night i thought mine was
o0k4fCBo9mA,1338080,1340000,pretty good scale was nice maybe could
o0k4fCBo9mA,1340000,1341600,use more color that's about all the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1341600,1343520,footage there is everything else is too
o0k4fCBo9mA,1343520,1345919,choppy had to make a hammer game 74 and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1345919,1347520,spent far too much time on the thing
o0k4fCBo9mA,1347520,1348880,that the hammer would be hammering
o0k4fCBo9mA,1348880,1350480,probably should have made a full guy
o0k4fCBo9mA,1350480,1352400,here but had to settle for a disembodied
o0k4fCBo9mA,1352400,1354080,arm then i had about two minutes to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1354080,1356000,spare and basically did nothing with
o0k4fCBo9mA,1356000,1357840,them i was on par with the competition
o0k4fCBo9mA,1357840,1359360,except for the guy that made thor's
o0k4fCBo9mA,1359360,1360960,hammer that's a good one now i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1360960,1363679,spawning a big scary mouse game 75 no
o0k4fCBo9mA,1363679,1365760,it's not a mouse it's a big angry rat
o0k4fCBo9mA,1365760,1367280,hope that doesn't affect the judging
o0k4fCBo9mA,1367280,1369200,mine went first and everyone thought it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1369200,1371280,was bad now put it next to this and it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,1371280,1374320,a masterpiece oh i get it it's a mouse
o0k4fCBo9mA,1374320,1376640,like a computer mouse despite my build
o0k4fCBo9mA,1376640,1378559,going first i still came in second and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1378559,1380480,to me that's a win theme was beard and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1380480,1382400,wasn't recording here's my build do you
o0k4fCBo9mA,1382400,1383760,like it this one looks like he's
o0k4fCBo9mA,1383760,1385760,vomiting black ooze this one i like a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1385760,1387280,lot this one's silly but it's
o0k4fCBo9mA,1387280,1389520,technically pixel art wow i did not
o0k4fCBo9mA,1389520,1391200,expect to win there were a lot of good
o0k4fCBo9mA,1391200,1393200,ones in there but you know what i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1393200,1395760,still proud theme was bunnygame77 and i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1395760,1397760,seemed to do well making them monstrous
o0k4fCBo9mA,1397760,1399520,the eyes came out a little funky but it
o0k4fCBo9mA,1399520,1401360,could do well if everyone else does bad
o0k4fCBo9mA,1401360,1403120,went first in the voting though there
o0k4fCBo9mA,1403120,1405280,goes all my dreams sir
o0k4fCBo9mA,1405280,1407120,did you just make bunny poo winner
o0k4fCBo9mA,1407120,1408720,deserved it that's a good bunny the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1408720,1410559,mirrors are floppy archer's now the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1410559,1412640,theme and i made a diagonal robin hood
o0k4fCBo9mA,1412640,1414240,though i realized way too late that he
o0k4fCBo9mA,1414240,1416080,should probably have a bow if this is
o0k4fCBo9mA,1416080,1418400,the archer theme and i made a bad arrow
o0k4fCBo9mA,1418400,1420159,that could have been really good but
o0k4fCBo9mA,1420159,1422320,it's just not to add insult to injury i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1422320,1424880,was also voted on first this one it kind
o0k4fCBo9mA,1424880,1426400,of looks like he took an arrow in the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1426400,1428320,face now the theme is dolphin and i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1428320,1429840,not gonna kill it because i don't think
o0k4fCBo9mA,1429840,1431279,people would like that i think that's a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1431279,1432880,pretty nice dolphin and i finished him
o0k4fCBo9mA,1432880,1434640,with quite some time left so i even gave
o0k4fCBo9mA,1434640,1436480,him a little orange fishy friend i think
o0k4fCBo9mA,1436480,1438960,it adds to the build this time
o0k4fCBo9mA,1438960,1441600,no no gotta say i really don't agree
o0k4fCBo9mA,1441600,1444320,here and i almost never do but this time
o0k4fCBo9mA,1444320,1446000,especially filled in the sand castle
o0k4fCBo9mA,1446000,1448000,with no clear plan i've done bad on
o0k4fCBo9mA,1448000,1449760,castle every single time this was the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1449760,1452080,winner looks like everyone else's mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,1452080,1454159,was bad and i got third place all right
o0k4fCBo9mA,1454159,1456159,now i'm making popcorn i have a feeling
o0k4fCBo9mA,1456159,1458000,this is gonna go really good or really
o0k4fCBo9mA,1458000,1460000,bad i spent a lot of time on the bucket
o0k4fCBo9mA,1460000,1461760,because i had no idea what to do for the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1461760,1463600,popcorn i just used a bunch of different
o0k4fCBo9mA,1463600,1465279,popcorn blocks let's see what everyone
o0k4fCBo9mA,1465279,1467120,else did the other builds were fine i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1467120,1468880,guess some were a little monotone but
o0k4fCBo9mA,1468880,1470960,all shared the common theme pixelart1
o0k4fCBo9mA,1470960,1472880,you know how i feel about that game 82
o0k4fCBo9mA,1472880,1474960,the theme was treasure i made a treasure
o0k4fCBo9mA,1474960,1477039,chest it's well made but probably won't
o0k4fCBo9mA,1477039,1479120,win personally i liked this mimic even
o0k4fCBo9mA,1479120,1481279,if it was a little small this one buried
o0k4fCBo9mA,1481279,1483360,treasure it's really good theme was mars
o0k4fCBo9mA,1483360,1485200,and i'm making a martian i've done this
o0k4fCBo9mA,1485200,1487520,before i made a moon man about 70 games
o0k4fCBo9mA,1487520,1489039,ago and i think i've improved on my
o0k4fCBo9mA,1489039,1490799,design a bit mine was voted on first and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1490799,1492559,he let them know how he felt i lost my
o0k4fCBo9mA,1492559,1494559,five points to a sandstone ball
o0k4fCBo9mA,1494559,1496320,sometimes i hate this game still more
o0k4fCBo9mA,1496320,1498320,space themes this time it's comet i got
o0k4fCBo9mA,1498320,1500159,a comment done a lot faster than i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1500159,1501679,thought and in the end it turned out
o0k4fCBo9mA,1501679,1503440,pretty nice that gave me enough time to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1503440,1505120,make earth i'm not a huge fan of it in
o0k4fCBo9mA,1505120,1507039,the ground like that but it looks okay
o0k4fCBo9mA,1507039,1508480,ah
o0k4fCBo9mA,1508480,1510880,whatever game 85 theme was piano and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1510880,1512720,after putting down a boring piano i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1512720,1514799,decided not to be boring it's a guy
o0k4fCBo9mA,1514799,1516559,playing a guitar that's a lot more
o0k4fCBo9mA,1516559,1518400,interesting oh would you look at that a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1518400,1521279,boring piano one self-portrait game 86
o0k4fCBo9mA,1521279,1523039,and i'm just gonna make an alex head i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1523039,1525200,don't think it'll win but my other idea
o0k4fCBo9mA,1525200,1527360,didn't either i thought i did a nice job
o0k4fCBo9mA,1527360,1528960,no one else did i'm kind of sick of
o0k4fCBo9mA,1528960,1531200,making castles and i know sand castle is
o0k4fCBo9mA,1531200,1532880,a different theme but i made a sand
o0k4fCBo9mA,1532880,1535279,castle it wasn't terrible maybe a little
o0k4fCBo9mA,1535279,1536880,small maybe a little simple but i'll
o0k4fCBo9mA,1536880,1538320,tell you my heart just wasn't in it the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1538320,1540640,castle that won wasn't even finished i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1540640,1542799,don't know anymore theme was tent game88
o0k4fCBo9mA,1542799,1544720,and i decided to make a tp the only
o0k4fCBo9mA,1544720,1546799,problem was it didn't look very good
o0k4fCBo9mA,1546799,1548880,that looks nothing like a tp the winner
o0k4fCBo9mA,1548880,1550799,was quite beautiful i must say theme
o0k4fCBo9mA,1550799,1553200,came up island game 89 and i probably
o0k4fCBo9mA,1553200,1554240,should have thought of something better
o0k4fCBo9mA,1554240,1555919,than a tropical island because i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1555919,1557840,telling you everyone made one i thought
o0k4fCBo9mA,1557840,1559679,i might spice it up a bit by adding a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1559679,1562480,big sos sign but it obviously was too
o0k4fCBo9mA,1562480,1565039,big i fixed it but the scales off i also
o0k4fCBo9mA,1565039,1567600,was not the only one to do sos this mini
o0k4fCBo9mA,1567600,1570000,end island one it's a good build checks
o0k4fCBo9mA,1570000,1572480,every box game 90 the theme was fire and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1572480,1574240,instead of making a campfire like
o0k4fCBo9mA,1574240,1575919,everyone else was going to do i was
o0k4fCBo9mA,1575919,1577520,going to make a house fire like i've
o0k4fCBo9mA,1577520,1579120,said one of the best ways to stand out
o0k4fCBo9mA,1579120,1580880,and build battles is stretch that theme
o0k4fCBo9mA,1580880,1582960,finished product looked nice maybe a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1582960,1584880,little simple but i think it'll do good
o0k4fCBo9mA,1584880,1587200,like i said everyone else made campfires
o0k4fCBo9mA,1587200,1588559,and when you vote on 10 different
o0k4fCBo9mA,1588559,1590240,campfires they all start to sort of look
o0k4fCBo9mA,1590240,1592080,the same i think this is supposed to be
o0k4fCBo9mA,1592080,1593520,a fire truck
o0k4fCBo9mA,1593520,1595840,good idea i guess hey look at that i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1595840,1597200,guess everyone here likes a little bit
o0k4fCBo9mA,1597200,1598880,of arson like last game i'm getting
o0k4fCBo9mA,1598880,1600640,creative the theme was rainbow and i'm
o0k4fCBo9mA,1600640,1602320,making a unicorn and not just any
o0k4fCBo9mA,1602320,1604880,unicorn a unicorn barfing a rainbow my
o0k4fCBo9mA,1604880,1606960,downfall here was noticing far too late
o0k4fCBo9mA,1606960,1608640,that my unicorn doesn't have a horn
o0k4fCBo9mA,1608640,1610080,hopefully the judges don't notice
o0k4fCBo9mA,1610080,1612080,everyone else just made rainbows they
o0k4fCBo9mA,1612080,1613760,all looked exactly like this one and a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1613760,1616720,rainbow one i mean it's nice good job i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1616720,1618799,guess now i gotta make a volcano and as
o0k4fCBo9mA,1618799,1620320,you can see from the very beginning i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1620320,1622080,was struggling the lava was really
o0k4fCBo9mA,1622080,1624320,messing with me and i used way too much
o0k4fCBo9mA,1624320,1625840,cobblestone you got to break up the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1625840,1628559,blocks it is a volcano just not a good
o0k4fCBo9mA,1628559,1630720,one this one good job beautiful theme
o0k4fCBo9mA,1630720,1632720,was cheese game 93 and this is one of
o0k4fCBo9mA,1632720,1634400,those games where i just tried to do too
o0k4fCBo9mA,1634400,1636559,much i wanted to construct a fancy plate
o0k4fCBo9mA,1636559,1638320,of wine and cheese and honestly i should
o0k4fCBo9mA,1638320,1639919,have just stopped right there i tried to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1639919,1641600,put a fork in the cheese and it just
o0k4fCBo9mA,1641600,1643600,didn't look right the scale was all off
o0k4fCBo9mA,1643600,1644960,yeah i think this build would have been
o0k4fCBo9mA,1644960,1646399,way better if i just got rid of that
o0k4fCBo9mA,1646399,1648640,fork now smelling stinky cheese one good
o0k4fCBo9mA,1648640,1650559,build now umbrella's the theme and i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1650559,1652640,instantly got a good idea making just an
o0k4fCBo9mA,1652640,1654480,umbrella would be very lame so i'm gonna
o0k4fCBo9mA,1654480,1656159,make a guy holding an umbrella for his
o0k4fCBo9mA,1656159,1658000,lady i spent four of the five minutes
o0k4fCBo9mA,1658000,1659520,making the two people because it's the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1659520,1661360,only thing in my build that'll stand out
o0k4fCBo9mA,1661360,1662960,it came out great but it was getting
o0k4fCBo9mA,1662960,1665279,voted on first this is a tragedy and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1665279,1667120,wouldn't you know my victory was robbed
o0k4fCBo9mA,1667120,1668799,by a basic umbrella wasn't recording
o0k4fCBo9mA,1668799,1670960,game 95 until there was three seconds
o0k4fCBo9mA,1670960,1672640,left the theme was painting i made a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1672640,1674480,person doing a self-portrait with blue
o0k4fCBo9mA,1674480,1676559,hair for extra flair nothing was nearly
o0k4fCBo9mA,1676559,1678399,as good this guy just wrote among us on
o0k4fCBo9mA,1678399,1680480,a sign i won my build was the most
o0k4fCBo9mA,1680480,1682880,notable game 96 the theme was arcade and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1682880,1684080,i think you can tell that this is
o0k4fCBo9mA,1684080,1685919,already way too big it was also kind of
o0k4fCBo9mA,1685919,1687760,a mistake using black concrete it was
o0k4fCBo9mA,1687760,1689360,hard to see where all my imperfections
o0k4fCBo9mA,1689360,1691279,were i'm not sure how but i got it all
o0k4fCBo9mA,1691279,1692880,done in five minutes the finished
o0k4fCBo9mA,1692880,1694320,product looked pretty nice though there
o0k4fCBo9mA,1694320,1696559,was a hole in the side i came in third i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1696559,1698240,thought i deserved better but i almost
o0k4fCBo9mA,1698240,1699679,always do wasn't recording for the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1699679,1701760,building of this solar system but mine
o0k4fCBo9mA,1701760,1704000,is awesome i've got every planet and a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1704000,1706320,sunglasses sun i do regret to say that i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1706320,1707600,had to leave out pluto i didn't have
o0k4fCBo9mA,1707600,1709039,enough room i want to point out the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1709039,1710399,theme was solar system
o0k4fCBo9mA,1710399,1712320,no one but me made the solar system a
o0k4fCBo9mA,1712320,1713679,lot of people made earth a lot of people
o0k4fCBo9mA,1713679,1715279,made some of the planets but a full
o0k4fCBo9mA,1715279,1717919,solar system only me i lost that's what
o0k4fCBo9mA,1717919,1719679,i get for leaving out pluto but this guy
o0k4fCBo9mA,1719679,1721760,did too i don't understand game 98 the
o0k4fCBo9mA,1721760,1723520,theme was panda that should be simple
o0k4fCBo9mA,1723520,1724880,enough there was a bit of an issue
o0k4fCBo9mA,1724880,1726880,though pandas are multiple colors and
o0k4fCBo9mA,1726880,1729200,after two minutes i barely had legs all
o0k4fCBo9mA,1729200,1731200,right i got the body done and now i have
o0k4fCBo9mA,1731200,1732960,a minute to do the most important part
o0k4fCBo9mA,1732960,1735279,the head i got close but didn't finish
o0k4fCBo9mA,1735279,1737120,it's a one-eyed panda maybe they'll
o0k4fCBo9mA,1737120,1738480,think it's supposed to be that way i
o0k4fCBo9mA,1738480,1740159,came in dead last and i didn't have to
o0k4fCBo9mA,1740159,1741760,make it so big this little cute thing
o0k4fCBo9mA,1741760,1744399,won game 99 was sushi and look at me
o0k4fCBo9mA,1744399,1746320,actually trying to make some sushi are
o0k4fCBo9mA,1746320,1747679,you proud probably would have done
o0k4fCBo9mA,1747679,1749440,better if i made a fish and put a knife
o0k4fCBo9mA,1749440,1751120,in it but i figured i'd give it a try
o0k4fCBo9mA,1751120,1752720,here's the thing i don't eat a lot of
