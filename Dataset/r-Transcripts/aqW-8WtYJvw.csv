aqW-8WtYJvw,80,2960,text to image synthesis though you may
aqW-8WtYJvw,2960,4960,not be familiar with this term but i
aqW-8WtYJvw,4960,6960,guarantee you that you have most likely
aqW-8WtYJvw,6960,8639,come across it unknowingly on the
aqW-8WtYJvw,8639,12160,internet maybe from a twitter post r wow
aqW-8WtYJvw,12160,15759,dude on reddit or even nft marketplaces
aqW-8WtYJvw,15759,18400,how can these things look so surreal
aqW-8WtYJvw,18400,20880,unrealistic and how are they all
aqW-8WtYJvw,20880,23359,generated from just plain text this
aqW-8WtYJvw,23359,25199,machine learning magic is often
aqW-8WtYJvw,25199,27519,categorized as text driven image
aqW-8WtYJvw,27519,30320,generation ai but what kinds of ai are
aqW-8WtYJvw,30320,32800,there where can i find them and how are
aqW-8WtYJvw,32800,35360,they different you may ask well you will
aqW-8WtYJvw,35360,37360,be able to find out the answers to these
aqW-8WtYJvw,37360,39760,questions in this video i'll be covering
aqW-8WtYJvw,39760,42000,all if not most of the modern text to
aqW-8WtYJvw,42000,44320,image ais and making this video almost
aqW-8WtYJvw,44320,46160,like a viewing fest
aqW-8WtYJvw,46160,47920,so even if you don't understand what
aqW-8WtYJvw,47920,50000,i'll be explaining later it's totally
aqW-8WtYJvw,50000,53039,alright just sit back relax and prepare
aqW-8WtYJvw,53039,55520,yourself for an experience of the most
aqW-8WtYJvw,55520,57600,beautiful page in the realm of ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,57600,58559,research
aqW-8WtYJvw,58559,64600,welcome to the world of ai generated art

aqW-8WtYJvw,90479,92960,ai research in the early 2000s has
aqW-8WtYJvw,92960,94560,already been sprouting out image
aqW-8WtYJvw,94560,96560,generation left and right but it was
aqW-8WtYJvw,96560,98960,only until the publication of deep dream
aqW-8WtYJvw,98960,101040,that the results from an ai was then
aqW-8WtYJvw,101040,103680,considered art the reason that it was
aqW-8WtYJvw,103680,105840,considered art was probably because of
aqW-8WtYJvw,105840,108880,its yearly results highly disturbing
aqW-8WtYJvw,108880,111840,while mildly intriguing and then there's
aqW-8WtYJvw,111840,114399,style transfer where the ai extracts the
aqW-8WtYJvw,114399,116719,style of an image and transfer it onto
aqW-8WtYJvw,116719,119040,another style transfer is a design
aqW-8WtYJvw,119040,120799,that's completely different to deep
aqW-8WtYJvw,120799,123119,dream and made its presence from some
aqW-8WtYJvw,123119,125280,genuinely stunning work in the recent
aqW-8WtYJvw,125280,127360,time but back when it was published in
aqW-8WtYJvw,127360,130000,2016 it was only like a cool little
aqW-8WtYJvw,130000,132080,trick that looked nice on technical
aqW-8WtYJvw,132080,133840,papers and then there was this thing
aqW-8WtYJvw,133840,137200,called again published in 2014. this
aqW-8WtYJvw,137200,139360,approach in generating images have shown
aqW-8WtYJvw,139360,141760,a lot of success specifically with
aqW-8WtYJvw,141760,146480,stallion in 2018 2019 and 2021 fake
aqW-8WtYJvw,146480,149920,faces fake cars fake animals you name it
aqW-8WtYJvw,149920,152000,nothing is impossible to generate for
aqW-8WtYJvw,152000,155519,against and they can look very realistic
aqW-8WtYJvw,155519,157920,i want you to remember this again thingy
aqW-8WtYJvw,157920,160000,because i think it is exceptional and
aqW-8WtYJvw,160000,163040,i'll talk about it again later hmm
aqW-8WtYJvw,163040,165200,you know if you pronounce again in a
aqW-8WtYJvw,165200,168560,very hard tone like again it's basically
aqW-8WtYJvw,168560,169440,saying
aqW-8WtYJvw,169440,170400,in chinese
aqW-8WtYJvw,170400,172319,okay so now you're informed of this
aqW-8WtYJvw,172319,174000,random fact that you'll remember for
aqW-8WtYJvw,174000,175920,your whole life while also remembering
aqW-8WtYJvw,175920,178000,this thing called again we can now move
aqW-8WtYJvw,178000,180000,on to the key moment that changed
aqW-8WtYJvw,180000,183000,everything
aqW-8WtYJvw,183210,186719,[Music]
aqW-8WtYJvw,188080,190720,the notion of ai taking over humans jobs
aqW-8WtYJvw,190720,193440,was merely a notion in science fiction
aqW-8WtYJvw,193440,195599,it was not until the release of dolly e
aqW-8WtYJvw,195599,199440,and clip by open ai on january 5th 2021
aqW-8WtYJvw,199440,202000,we caught a taste of this dark future
aqW-8WtYJvw,202000,203599,dolly e showed to the world that
aqW-8WtYJvw,203599,206159,generating illustrations is as simple as
aqW-8WtYJvw,206159,208799,giving a verbal description of the image
aqW-8WtYJvw,208799,210959,an illustration of a pikachu in a cape
aqW-8WtYJvw,210959,213280,playing a guitar a cellphone case with
aqW-8WtYJvw,213280,216159,an image of a blue carrot the limit is
aqW-8WtYJvw,216159,218400,literally your imagination and it does
aqW-8WtYJvw,218400,220480,not stop here the moment that changed
aqW-8WtYJvw,220480,222400,everything is not how well dolly e
aqW-8WtYJvw,222400,224480,generates everything realistically but
aqW-8WtYJvw,224480,226720,instead the ability to understand the
aqW-8WtYJvw,226720,228879,text to make those images in the first
aqW-8WtYJvw,228879,231360,place this ability to connect the ideas
aqW-8WtYJvw,231360,233680,inside text and images was only made
aqW-8WtYJvw,233680,236239,possible by clip what clip essentially
aqW-8WtYJvw,236239,237920,does is that it rates the text
aqW-8WtYJvw,237920,239840,description against the image by how
aqW-8WtYJvw,239840,242080,well it describes the image clip learned
aqW-8WtYJvw,242080,243920,how to do this through multi-modal
aqW-8WtYJvw,243920,246000,learning from the numerous pairs of text
aqW-8WtYJvw,246000,248480,and image in its training stage so in
aqW-8WtYJvw,248480,251040,dolly e clip basically rates how close
aqW-8WtYJvw,251040,253120,the current generated image is to the
aqW-8WtYJvw,253120,255760,input text given from the user and it is
aqW-8WtYJvw,255760,257919,this iterative process from noise that
aqW-8WtYJvw,257919,260400,slowly creates details in the process to
aqW-8WtYJvw,260400,262800,then create an image that matches or at
aqW-8WtYJvw,262800,264720,least attempt to match the given
aqW-8WtYJvw,264720,266960,description for all the ais i'll be
aqW-8WtYJvw,266960,268560,mentioning in the rest of this video
aqW-8WtYJvw,268560,271040,roughly follows this clip with some sort
aqW-8WtYJvw,271040,273440,of generator paradigm while we're at it
aqW-8WtYJvw,273440,275040,these three are the most popular
aqW-8WtYJvw,275040,277840,generator or generative approaches while
aqW-8WtYJvw,277840,279919,they can sell very individually this is
aqW-8WtYJvw,279919,282560,how they generally look like again is
aqW-8WtYJvw,282560,285199,the one that i've mentioned earlier vae
aqW-8WtYJvw,285199,287520,is the one that dolly e uses more
aqW-8WtYJvw,287520,290880,specifically vq vae and the fusion
aqW-8WtYJvw,290880,293440,models they're like this new cool thing
aqW-8WtYJvw,293440,295759,in the ai world that only became popular
aqW-8WtYJvw,295759,298080,very recently you'll see soon with this
aqW-8WtYJvw,298080,300720,vq vie and clip relationship people
aqW-8WtYJvw,300720,302639,started experimenting with various
aqW-8WtYJvw,302639,304479,different generative models and putting
aqW-8WtYJvw,304479,306880,them together with clip most notably
aqW-8WtYJvw,306880,308639,catherine crossing was the first to
aqW-8WtYJvw,308639,311440,pioneer this by creating vq campus clip
aqW-8WtYJvw,311440,313360,made on a google collab notebook which
aqW-8WtYJvw,313360,315520,is a place you can run codes online
aqW-8WtYJvw,315520,318080,bqgam plus clip itself was a success
aqW-8WtYJvw,318080,319759,people were getting cool results that
aqW-8WtYJvw,319759,322080,they wouldn't have never imagined like
aqW-8WtYJvw,322080,324560,literally never imagined and prompt
aqW-8WtYJvw,324560,326800,engineering became a crucial step to get
aqW-8WtYJvw,326800,329360,cool results because mentioning an art
aqW-8WtYJvw,329360,331440,style in the text prompt will largely
aqW-8WtYJvw,331440,333120,affect the direction of the general
aqW-8WtYJvw,333120,336160,generation the ai has this gave birth to
aqW-8WtYJvw,336160,338800,the unreal engine trick whereby adding
aqW-8WtYJvw,338800,340560,this phrase at the end of your text
aqW-8WtYJvw,340560,342880,prompt anything that vq game plus clip
aqW-8WtYJvw,342880,345199,generates would then become extremely
aqW-8WtYJvw,345199,347440,realistic especially the lighting
aqW-8WtYJvw,347440,350320,however there is just one slight issue
aqW-8WtYJvw,350320,352400,the results aren't ideal most of the
aqW-8WtYJvw,352400,354960,time so people started tuning fixing the
aqW-8WtYJvw,354960,357039,notebook by themselves uploading their
aqW-8WtYJvw,357039,359280,version of notebook and sharing it with
aqW-8WtYJvw,359280,361919,everyone else in this process countless
aqW-8WtYJvw,361919,364080,notebooks with modifications would flood
aqW-8WtYJvw,364080,365840,the internet but at the same time
aqW-8WtYJvw,365840,367919,creating this new relationship between
aqW-8WtYJvw,367919,370720,ai art and collab notebooks so when
aqW-8WtYJvw,370720,372639,someone comes across a good generated
aqW-8WtYJvw,372639,375680,art instead of asking which ai people
aqW-8WtYJvw,375680,378240,would ask notebook instead the
aqW-8WtYJvw,378240,379919,combination of clip with other
aqW-8WtYJvw,379919,382000,generative models were not left behind
aqW-8WtYJvw,382000,385280,either clip plus again became the big
aqW-8WtYJvw,385280,388720,sleep clip plus siren became deep days
aqW-8WtYJvw,388720,390479,while i would say both weren't as
aqW-8WtYJvw,390479,393039,impressive as vqgam plus clip and with a
aqW-8WtYJvw,393039,394400,very small resolution
aqW-8WtYJvw,394400,396400,they do however produce some really
aqW-8WtYJvw,396400,398720,fascinating results by themselves just
aqW-8WtYJvw,398720,403050,to show a few examples here
aqW-8WtYJvw,403050,409328,[Music]
aqW-8WtYJvw,418319,422000,by may of 2021 the atmosphere starts to
aqW-8WtYJvw,422000,424960,change a little bit in the realm of ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,424960,427520,gen which used to dominate in ai fields
aqW-8WtYJvw,427520,429599,that require generating images has
aqW-8WtYJvw,429599,433039,finally met its maker the fusion gen is
aqW-8WtYJvw,433039,435280,a technique that in essence is an artist
aqW-8WtYJvw,435280,437360,in a critique going off at each other
aqW-8WtYJvw,437360,439680,each time the artist paints something
aqW-8WtYJvw,439680,441840,artist aims to paint as close as the
aqW-8WtYJvw,441840,443759,target while the critique tells the
aqW-8WtYJvw,443759,445680,artists how badly they've drawn against
aqW-8WtYJvw,445680,448319,the target this toxic work relationship
aqW-8WtYJvw,448319,450800,has finally been beaten by diffusion who
aqW-8WtYJvw,450800,452800,learns how to denoise an image in a
aqW-8WtYJvw,452800,455919,step-by-step process eq gam plus clip is
aqW-8WtYJvw,455919,457840,probably the last place we saw the use
aqW-8WtYJvw,457840,460479,of gen in generative art thanks to
aqW-8WtYJvw,460479,462639,openai's guided diffusion published in
aqW-8WtYJvw,462639,465440,may of 2021 after catherine crossin's
aqW-8WtYJvw,465440,468080,combination of clip and guided diffusion
aqW-8WtYJvw,468080,470879,ai generative art was never the same
aqW-8WtYJvw,470879,473599,again clip plus guided diffusion equals
aqW-8WtYJvw,473599,476080,clip diffusion clip diffusion began its
aqW-8WtYJvw,476080,478400,rise the same way how the qkm plus clip
aqW-8WtYJvw,478400,481440,grew initially google's collab notebooks
aqW-8WtYJvw,481440,483919,when the 256 unconditional image net and
aqW-8WtYJvw,483919,485919,the 512 class conditional imagenet
aqW-8WtYJvw,485919,488319,diffusion model were made people started
aqW-8WtYJvw,488319,490400,editing these notebooks and more and
aqW-8WtYJvw,490400,492240,more beautifully created pieces were
aqW-8WtYJvw,492240,494560,produced and shared on the internet day
aqW-8WtYJvw,494560,497120,in and day out with this huge amount of
aqW-8WtYJvw,497120,499120,notebooks floating around the internet
aqW-8WtYJvw,499120,500560,some night went out of the way to
aqW-8WtYJvw,500560,503360,collect and modify clip diffusion's 512
aqW-8WtYJvw,503360,505440,model and successfully made it easier
aqW-8WtYJvw,505440,507440,for most people to use and get good
aqW-8WtYJvw,507440,510000,results this gave birth to disco
aqW-8WtYJvw,510000,512080,diffusion one of the most popular open
aqW-8WtYJvw,512080,514719,source ai generative art variations to
aqW-8WtYJvw,514719,516719,exist on the internet this code
aqW-8WtYJvw,516719,519760,diffusion currently now version 5.2
aqW-8WtYJvw,519760,522000,offers an immense amount of control in
aqW-8WtYJvw,522000,524320,its customization not only does it have
aqW-8WtYJvw,524320,526640,the ability to generate videos but also
aqW-8WtYJvw,526640,528880,has the ability to control how the
aqW-8WtYJvw,528880,530720,videos are being generated with its
aqW-8WtYJvw,530720,532959,super good latent control and mostly
aqW-8WtYJvw,532959,535680,implemented by gandamu video results
aqW-8WtYJvw,535680,539120,like 2d animation works beautifully 3d
aqW-8WtYJvw,539120,541200,animation works smoothly and
aqW-8WtYJvw,541200,542720,realistically
aqW-8WtYJvw,542720,545040,all because there is this group of great
aqW-8WtYJvw,545040,547200,developers constantly improving disco
aqW-8WtYJvw,547200,549360,diffusion and what it has to offer for
aqW-8WtYJvw,549360,552000,free which is just amazing due to the
aqW-8WtYJvw,552000,554480,complex nature of making ai generative
aqW-8WtYJvw,554480,556959,art studies on prompt engineering
aqW-8WtYJvw,556959,559440,started to emerge on the internet in
aqW-8WtYJvw,559440,562000,order to generate a good result the text
aqW-8WtYJvw,562000,563680,prompt that is used for the ai should
aqW-8WtYJvw,563680,566160,include modifiers at the end this is
aqW-8WtYJvw,566160,568000,essentially telling the ai that you want
aqW-8WtYJvw,568000,570160,a specific art style to be included in
aqW-8WtYJvw,570160,572640,the piece so the ai would generate the
aqW-8WtYJvw,572640,574959,image or video in the art style that you
aqW-8WtYJvw,574959,577360,desire i mean if you don't specify
aqW-8WtYJvw,577360,579440,anything how would the ai know what you
aqW-8WtYJvw,579440,582080,want to put it simply the term unreal
aqW-8WtYJvw,582080,583839,engine that i mentioned previously is
aqW-8WtYJvw,583839,586160,basically a modifier you could use along
aqW-8WtYJvw,586160,588480,with other hundreds or thousands of
aqW-8WtYJvw,588480,590880,terms that can also determine an art
aqW-8WtYJvw,590880,593040,style of an image or even technical
aqW-8WtYJvw,593040,595760,details like camera lens size polaroid
aqW-8WtYJvw,595760,598560,or even camera model can change how the
aqW-8WtYJvw,598560,600720,resulting image looks which is
aqW-8WtYJvw,600720,602880,fascinating part me made a really
aqW-8WtYJvw,602880,604959,insightful blog about this and just to

aqW-8WtYJvw,621040,622880,but we wrote with the jacks library
aqW-8WtYJvw,622880,625360,instead of the classic torch is another
aqW-8WtYJvw,625360,627360,diffusion variation that's modified by
aqW-8WtYJvw,627360,629519,unshippered its difference with disco
aqW-8WtYJvw,629519,631519,diffusion is
aqW-8WtYJvw,631519,633680,pretty hard to tell what's obvious
aqW-8WtYJvw,633680,635680,though is that jax seems to be pretty
aqW-8WtYJvw,635680,637440,good at generating geometric or
aqW-8WtYJvw,637440,640240,symmetrical shapes compared to others so
aqW-8WtYJvw,640240,642399,when you see any cool shapes like this
aqW-8WtYJvw,642399,645200,it's probably made from jacks but keep
aqW-8WtYJvw,645200,647839,in mind that jax and disco diffusion is
aqW-8WtYJvw,647839,650560,sometimes both referred to as clip
aqW-8WtYJvw,650560,652720,diffusion since they are just slightly
aqW-8WtYJvw,652720,655040,modified and optimized versions of the
aqW-8WtYJvw,655040,657519,original clip diffusion in december of
aqW-8WtYJvw,657519,660560,2021 latent diffusion was published and
aqW-8WtYJvw,660560,662959,later on combined with clip once again
aqW-8WtYJvw,662959,664560,becoming the next generation of
aqW-8WtYJvw,664560,666800,diffusion models in its intended
aqW-8WtYJvw,666800,668959,purposes latent diffusion has the
aqW-8WtYJvw,668959,671120,ability to generate close to reality
aqW-8WtYJvw,671120,673920,images similar to what doly e can do but
aqW-8WtYJvw,673920,675920,it is much improved because it's open
aqW-8WtYJvw,675920,678640,sourced as in everyone has access to it
aqW-8WtYJvw,678640,680480,everyone can see the code and it's not
aqW-8WtYJvw,680480,682720,behind a paywall or have never seen the
aqW-8WtYJvw,682720,685120,light of the world even though latent
aqW-8WtYJvw,685120,687600,diffusion is not completely out of the
aqW-8WtYJvw,687600,689839,world by itself its most recent
aqW-8WtYJvw,689839,691760,combination with disco diffusion to
aqW-8WtYJvw,691760,694079,create centipede diffusion is definitely
aqW-8WtYJvw,694079,695920,something of its own what centipede
aqW-8WtYJvw,695920,698240,diffusion offers is the creativity of
aqW-8WtYJvw,698240,700240,disco diffusion and the coherence and
aqW-8WtYJvw,700240,703200,consistency of latent diffusion so it is
aqW-8WtYJvw,703200,705680,able to or at least attempt to hold
aqW-8WtYJvw,705680,708160,together conceptual ideas or objects
aqW-8WtYJvw,708160,710399,unlike clip diffusion that creates fuzzy
aqW-8WtYJvw,710399,713440,or indistinguishable outlines easily so
aqW-8WtYJvw,713440,715760,here's a little map i've devised to
aqW-8WtYJvw,715760,718000,easier navigate the complex landscape of
aqW-8WtYJvw,718000,722040,ai generative models and while i was at
aqW-8WtYJvw,722040,726040,its world
aqW-8WtYJvw,727930,731350,[Music]
aqW-8WtYJvw,733450,740560,[Music]
aqW-8WtYJvw,740560,744560,in april 2022 dolly e2 was something i
aqW-8WtYJvw,744560,746800,did not anticipate in the midst of the
aqW-8WtYJvw,746800,749519,rise of diffusion models it instantly
aqW-8WtYJvw,749519,751600,stands out not because it is a project
aqW-8WtYJvw,751600,754320,from open ai but because its results
aqW-8WtYJvw,754320,759279,were phenomenal quality perfect accuracy
aqW-8WtYJvw,759279,761600,perfect realism
aqW-8WtYJvw,761600,762720,perfect
aqW-8WtYJvw,762720,764800,it really was something i did not expect
aqW-8WtYJvw,764800,766560,machine learning to be able to do in
aqW-8WtYJvw,766560,768480,such a short amount of time
aqW-8WtYJvw,768480,770160,but exactly how
aqW-8WtYJvw,770160,772720,all we know is clip and diffusion as
aqW-8WtYJvw,772720,775200,they unfortunately did not reveal any
aqW-8WtYJvw,775200,777680,further details to put it in comparison
aqW-8WtYJvw,777680,780560,here is dolly e2 and latent diffusion
aqW-8WtYJvw,780560,783519,side by side the holley e2 outperforms
aqW-8WtYJvw,783519,787120,in resolution style coherence and
aqW-8WtYJvw,787120,788639,creativity

aqW-8WtYJvw,807519,810240,in a forest it just gets better and
aqW-8WtYJvw,810240,812399,better and better you can never get sick
aqW-8WtYJvw,812399,814000,of looking at these results and
aqW-8WtYJvw,814000,816399,amazingly open ai is also providing
aqW-8WtYJvw,816399,818480,people with early access if you sign up
aqW-8WtYJvw,818480,820880,right now while there are also many
aqW-8WtYJvw,820880,823199,others like glide that uses classifier
aqW-8WtYJvw,823199,825040,free guidance diffusion
aqW-8WtYJvw,825040,827199,cog view which is a chinese version of
aqW-8WtYJvw,827199,830399,dali e and rue dali e which is a russian
aqW-8WtYJvw,830399,832880,version of dolly e were nowhere near
aqW-8WtYJvw,832880,835279,close in imitating what the original can
aqW-8WtYJvw,835279,836000,do
aqW-8WtYJvw,836000,838880,and that is the peak of ai text to image
aqW-8WtYJvw,838880,841120,generation right now in the future we
aqW-8WtYJvw,841120,843360,may not need a search engine for images
aqW-8WtYJvw,843360,845600,we can just ask the ai to draw an
aqW-8WtYJvw,845600,847680,aeropng with a transparent background
aqW-8WtYJvw,847680,849600,without the need of downloading fake
aqW-8WtYJvw,849600,852880,pngs and that would be amazing but
aqW-8WtYJvw,852880,855760,the ai art generation still has a
aqW-8WtYJvw,855760,858480,contender mid journey made by one of the
aqW-8WtYJvw,858480,860480,key contributors of disco diffusion and
aqW-8WtYJvw,860480,862399,many others i feel like categorizing
aqW-8WtYJvw,862399,864720,this and dolly e2 together is just kind
aqW-8WtYJvw,864720,867680,of unfair one is more focused on realism
aqW-8WtYJvw,867680,869600,and the other is going for the art
aqW-8WtYJvw,869600,872399,styles well that is totally my personal
aqW-8WtYJvw,872399,874800,opinion but text to image r generation
aqW-8WtYJvw,874800,876639,really do give a different vibe if you
aqW-8WtYJvw,876639,878800,just take a closer look at what it can
aqW-8WtYJvw,878800,881800,do
aqW-8WtYJvw,883780,892480,[Music]
aqW-8WtYJvw,892480,894399,mid journey is a private project that is
aqW-8WtYJvw,894399,897040,currently in beto speculated utilizing
aqW-8WtYJvw,897040,899040,both guided and latent diffusion with
aqW-8WtYJvw,899040,901519,clip in creating artworks it's a very
aqW-8WtYJvw,901519,903680,discord orientated project where you
aqW-8WtYJvw,903680,906000,have to get invited to join its private
aqW-8WtYJvw,906000,908639,beta and a subscription to use the ai in
aqW-8WtYJvw,908639,910800,exchange for computational costs i was
aqW-8WtYJvw,910800,912480,lucky that i got to try out the ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,912480,914800,myself not sponsor by the way and it was
aqW-8WtYJvw,914800,917440,way faster than i anticipated modifier
aqW-8WtYJvw,917440,919760,terms like digital painting and trending
aqW-8WtYJvw,919760,922079,on art station are especially popular to
aqW-8WtYJvw,922079,924240,use with their service which i also
aqW-8WtYJvw,924240,926320,found intriguing it's speculated that
aqW-8WtYJvw,926320,928480,mid journey is generating a low res
aqW-8WtYJvw,928480,930240,image using a model that is tuned for
aqW-8WtYJvw,930240,932079,that resolution which allows them to
aqW-8WtYJvw,932079,934079,begin with relatively good image
aqW-8WtYJvw,934079,936399,coherence it then continues to diffuse
aqW-8WtYJvw,936399,939199,at a higher resolution while all models
aqW-8WtYJvw,939199,941040,are unknown of course mid journey's
aqW-8WtYJvw,941040,942959,result really just sets itself apart
aqW-8WtYJvw,942959,944720,from the others it's like setting a
aqW-8WtYJvw,944720,947600,standard in what is being called nai art
aqW-8WtYJvw,947600,949839,with the wildest and the weirdest design
aqW-8WtYJvw,949839,952639,any human and the ai can dream of and to
aqW-8WtYJvw,952639,955040,truly test the limit of ai generative r
aqW-8WtYJvw,955040,957120,i am going to host a small ai art
aqW-8WtYJvw,957120,959120,competition starting from when this
aqW-8WtYJvw,959120,960800,video is published i feel like it would
aqW-8WtYJvw,960800,963279,be fun to see ar being generated even
aqW-8WtYJvw,963279,965360,more seriously like for a competition
aqW-8WtYJvw,965360,967839,and such and inspire people to input
aqW-8WtYJvw,967839,969920,more creativity than usual to generate
aqW-8WtYJvw,969920,972240,their ai artwork the deadline will be
aqW-8WtYJvw,972240,974720,july 10th for now with five categories
aqW-8WtYJvw,974720,976880,for you to win in as for the prize poll
aqW-8WtYJvw,976880,979040,i'll see if i can find any sponsors that
aqW-8WtYJvw,979040,980959,can increase it but right now personally
aqW-8WtYJvw,980959,983279,i can only afford around 500 for
aqW-8WtYJvw,983279,984880,everyone to compete if you have any
aqW-8WtYJvw,984880,986800,suggestions feel free to contact me and
aqW-8WtYJvw,986800,988880,i plan to live stream myself reviewing
aqW-8WtYJvw,988880,990560,all the submissions and have a viewing
aqW-8WtYJvw,990560,992480,fest with every one of you so follow me
aqW-8WtYJvw,992480,995759,on twitch.tv icloudai and on twitter for
aqW-8WtYJvw,995759,998320,more information and the latest update
aqW-8WtYJvw,998320,1000959,with that being said these amazing ais
aqW-8WtYJvw,1000959,1003519,do prompt some side effects what does it
aqW-8WtYJvw,1003519,1006480,mean for the future of artists well i am
aqW-8WtYJvw,1006480,1008720,not an artist myself i cannot express
aqW-8WtYJvw,1008720,1010959,genuinely how it will affect them the
aqW-8WtYJvw,1010959,1013040,job market and the ecosystem of
aqW-8WtYJvw,1013040,1015120,freelancing but what i definitely know
aqW-8WtYJvw,1015120,1017440,is that vector r and clip art would
aqW-8WtYJvw,1017440,1019519,probably experience a saturation and
aqW-8WtYJvw,1019519,1021519,slow decline in the need of actual
aqW-8WtYJvw,1021519,1024240,artists when dolly e2 or just any ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,1024240,1026720,generative models mature and you can
aqW-8WtYJvw,1026720,1028798,start to see the cycle of the bridge
aqW-8WtYJvw,1028798,1030720,getting richer and normies getting
aqW-8WtYJvw,1030720,1033280,warmer big companies are definitely
aqW-8WtYJvw,1033280,1035199,going to throw around these expensive ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,1035199,1037360,models to profit off infinitely while
aqW-8WtYJvw,1037360,1039199,most of us can only sit here and watch
aqW-8WtYJvw,1039199,1041360,the economy burn well this is definitely
aqW-8WtYJvw,1041360,1043038,just one of my hot takes for the future
aqW-8WtYJvw,1043038,1045600,of ai's and i really do hope skel is not
aqW-8WtYJvw,1045600,1047678,everything because if it is cycles will
aqW-8WtYJvw,1047678,1049440,definitely happen and will be the ones
aqW-8WtYJvw,1049440,1051600,in trouble and there's flamingo the next
aqW-8WtYJvw,1051600,1054559,gen of clip made by deepmind from google
aqW-8WtYJvw,1054559,1056480,the accuracy in describing the image
aqW-8WtYJvw,1056480,1059360,provided is absolute mental just wait
aqW-8WtYJvw,1059360,1061520,for this to combine with disco diffusion
aqW-8WtYJvw,1061520,1062960,and we'll probably have another ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,1062960,1065120,generative toy to play with
aqW-8WtYJvw,1065120,1066799,and today's video is brought to you by
aqW-8WtYJvw,1066799,1069280,skillshare skillshare is an online

aqW-8WtYJvw,1079039,1081200,probably will want to know more about ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,1081200,1083280,and machine learning then i suggest this
aqW-8WtYJvw,1083280,1085440,class called artificial intelligence for
aqW-8WtYJvw,1085440,1087360,beginners tools to learn machine
aqW-8WtYJvw,1087360,1089919,learning by alvin wen which provides a
aqW-8WtYJvw,1089919,1091679,very great introduction into practical
aqW-8WtYJvw,1091679,1093760,machine learning the lessons aren't that
aqW-8WtYJvw,1093760,1095520,long either so you can easily go through
aqW-8WtYJvw,1095520,1097360,them during your free time what's even
