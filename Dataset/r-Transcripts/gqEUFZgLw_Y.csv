gqEUFZgLw_Y,180,1650,- Walmart is turned Onn.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,1650,2699,And so am I.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,2700,3533,That's right.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,3533,4950,After being laughed out of town
gqEUFZgLw_Y,4950,7559,when their overpowered series of gaming desktops received
gqEUFZgLw_Y,7560,9240,"universally negative reviews,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,9240,10710,Walmart is now back
gqEUFZgLw_Y,10710,13710,with a full slew of gaming peripherals.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,13710,15330,"We got speakers, monitors, (dramatic thuds)"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,15330,19050,"webcams, microphones, keyboards mice, desk pads,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,19050,21783,and even the desk itself.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,22770,24330,Some of it's good.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,24330,27453,Some of it literally smells like poo.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,28950,30690,And I'll tell you all about it after this segue
gqEUFZgLw_Y,30690,31829,to our sponsor!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,31829,32759,NZXT!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,32759,36149,NZXT wants to make building a custom PC easier.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,36150,38610,"With NZXT BLD, just set a budget,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,38610,40950,"see how the computer performs with your favorite games,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,40950,42690,and BLD takes care of the rest.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,42690,45840,Use the link below to get your own custom PC today.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,45840,47730,Our journey begins with the aptly named
gqEUFZgLw_Y,47730,50820,Hometrends computer desk.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,50820,54930,They helpfully left out words like trendy or deluxe
gqEUFZgLw_Y,54930,57930,and they do admit that it's made of PVC.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,57930,60210,"Has a soft-close door, though. (door bangs)"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,60210,62820,"Oh, well hold on, sorry."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,62820,63930,There you go. (laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,63930,65730,"Having not seen the listing on their site,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,65730,69840,I'm guessing 119 Canadian dollars.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,69840,70740,- [Adam] Oh wow.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,70740,72060,"Well, you're not--"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,72060,72960,You said Canadian?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,72960,73793,- I said Canadian.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,73793,75510,- [Adam] You're $10 over on the Canadian price.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,75510,76920,- I'm $10 over.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,76920,77753,Wow.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,77753,78689,"Well, that's pretty good."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,78690,80460,I'm not saying I'd pay that for it.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,80460,81720,"- Yeah, and especially when you consider"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,81720,83910,"that you could just go to Ikea,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,83910,87030,do the classic countertop plus four legs
gqEUFZgLw_Y,87030,88229,and a set of Alex drawers.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,88230,89250,"- For half the price, yes."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,89250,90083,- Well...
gqEUFZgLw_Y,90083,90916,"- Well, a little over half"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,90916,91749,"with the ALEX drawers. - If you get the ALEX drawers,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,91749,93480,"it's, like, $10 more."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,93480,96180,- Certainly it'll be larger. (laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,96180,98250,This is like a little Linus-sized desk!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,98250,100893,"- Well, we brought you a little Linus-sized chair!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,102360,103200,- [David] Ew.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,103200,105689,- What makes this a gaming chair?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,105690,108210,"Other than that it's RGB, sort of. (laughs)"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,108210,110159,- This isn't the actual gaming chair that we got you.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,110160,113430,This is just their default office chair.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,113430,114450,- I see.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,114450,116670,This is their default office chair?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,116670,118049,Whose office has--
gqEUFZgLw_Y,118050,119280,You know what?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,119280,122159,"To their credit, the butt cushion on this"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,122160,123600,is actually better than
gqEUFZgLw_Y,123600,125909,almost any chair I've ever encountered
gqEUFZgLw_Y,125910,127530,"under, like, 100 bucks."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,127530,130080,"- [Adam] Yeah, that might be true for the first half hour."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,130080,131400,- [Linus] I'm guessing...
gqEUFZgLw_Y,131400,133353,"No, I'm guessing $89.99."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,134910,136140,- US or Canadian?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,136140,136972,- [Linus] Canadian.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,136973,138360,It's $69.99 Canadian.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,138360,140089,- It's $69.99 Canadian? - [David] Wow!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,140089,140922,- Yeah.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,140922,142620,"And, feasibly, if it's for a child"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,142620,144870,"who's very lightweight, the foam was probably gonna be"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,144870,145799,plenty of support.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,145800,147960,- And it is kind of child-sized.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,147960,149340,Along with this desk.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,149340,150959,- Let's get some gaming accessories.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,150960,152940,I think the first thing we have to start with
gqEUFZgLw_Y,152940,154023,is our monitor.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,155670,157530,"- Oh, that's a cute pun."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,157530,160200,"I thought the monitor was just called the Game,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,160200,164010,which I guess I lost now... (David groaning)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,164010,165780,"But it's ""Game Onn,"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,165780,167610,which I guess is more just their slogan
gqEUFZgLw_Y,167610,170673,and the product is the curved QHD gaming monitor.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,171851,173490,Ooh!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,173490,176070,"Well, that's definitely for gamers."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,176070,178860,It's very light. (laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,178860,181920,Are you getting the point based on how easily
gqEUFZgLw_Y,181920,183510,I can wiggle this around? - [David] Yeah.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,183510,186390,You've got what used to be speaker grills down here.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,186390,188490,"Clearly, this is a repurposed chassis"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,188490,190140,"from a different model of display,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,190140,192450,'cause there's no speakers in there.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,192450,195428,"You got HDMI1, HDMI2, and display port."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,195428,197189,"Now there's your power in, external power brick,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,197190,198360,and the headphone jack.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,198360,199800,"Base mounting, though."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,199800,201540,That's always nice to have.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,201540,204180,And it's got joystick-style controls.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,204180,206459,"Nice, quick and easy assembly so far, though."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,206460,208470,It's completely toolless up 'til now.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,208470,209730,"Wow, this is surprising."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,209730,212670,"It comes with both a display port and an HDMI cable,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,212670,214860,"which isn't a big deal for a high end monitor,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,214860,216330,but for budget monitors
gqEUFZgLw_Y,216330,218760,"where they're trying to save every couple of dollars,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,218760,220439,it's an unexpected inclusion.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,220440,222810,It means that it'll be ready to go for both your gaming PC
gqEUFZgLw_Y,222810,225330,"and your console, if you're in your dorm room or whatever,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,225330,226380,right outta the box.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,226380,230647,I'm saying this puppy is $239.99 US.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,230647,231910,- [Adam] $209 US.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,231910,233400,"- $209, okay."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,233400,234840,Well I'm glad I didn't go higher.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,234840,237599,"And wait, it's even got height adjust!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,237600,238550,"Okay, none of that."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,239880,241410,Wow.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,241410,243150,"Suck on that, Apple."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,243150,244829,- [David] Oh!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,244830,247200,- Do these have Onn branding on them?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,247200,249209,"- No, these are just the most generic"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,249210,250440,display port cables I've ever seen.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,250440,252090,- That's funny because they actually sell
gqEUFZgLw_Y,252090,253860,Onn HDMI cables
gqEUFZgLw_Y,253860,256410,and Onn premium HDMI cables for twice the price.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,256410,257850,- Oh.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,257850,259980,What makes the premium ones premium?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,259980,260909,- The price!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,260909,261742,(Linus chuckles)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,261742,262740,"- I mean, before we get anywhere,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,262740,264607,we need something to plug it into.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,264607,265949,"- ""Protect Onn."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,265950,268620,"Oh, I thought it was a joke."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,268620,269520,"When it was, like, ""Game Onn?"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,269520,271387,"Yeah, they're still making puns here!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,271387,273090,"""Hang Onn!"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,273090,274139,"What, ""Hang Onn?"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,274140,275400,"Oh, I get it. - And, you know,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,275400,277080,"Protect Onn, that thing that everyone says."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,277080,279000,"- Yeah, Protect O-- - Yeah."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,279000,281340,- Holy crap. (plastic banging on table)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,281340,283680,"This is dollar store grade,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,283680,287103,but with five volt 2.4 amps shared charging.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,288090,289290,"Man, I'm sorry."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,289290,291540,I know this is gonna derail things a little bit.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,291540,293550,- [Adam] Do you wanna guess the price before we go in there?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,293550,296133,- The price better not be more than like 10 bucks.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,297187,298770,- $25.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,298770,300270,- This boy got mashed.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,300270,302490,"Initially, I thought there was absolutely nothing"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,302490,305069,clamping down this main AC power cord.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,305070,306330,"Like, I thought you could just"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,306330,307620,pull on this thing and it would just
gqEUFZgLw_Y,307620,310800,heave on the solder joints but that's not actually the case.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,310800,313080,The plastic molding has these little ribs
gqEUFZgLw_Y,313080,316849,that use this screw and this one to kind of
gqEUFZgLw_Y,316849,318330,(grunts) clamp down on it.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,318330,320430,"To be clear, it's not great. (laughs)"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,320430,321509,But it's something.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,321510,323880,"- Well, let's get you to the accessories."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,323880,325260,- We're back to Gaming Onn.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,325260,326093,- Yes.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,326093,326926,- Oh!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,326926,328560,This is a mechanical keyboard.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,328560,330600,"- [David] Hey! - Oh, that's why it's called"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,330600,332647,RGB mechanical keyboard. (Adam laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,332647,334710,"""Satisfying sharp click."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,334710,337919,"Well, I think satisfying and sharp is a little optimistic."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,337920,340020,"(keys clacking) - Also, did they mention"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,340020,341879,what kind of blue switches?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,341880,343080,"- No, they don't, but these are"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,343080,345629,"extremely twangy, cheap blue switches."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,345630,348270,"Plastic base, but metal deck."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,348270,350669,Actually decent flex.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,350670,353790,Multiple cable channels.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,353790,355650,Height adjust.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,355650,357449,I'd never buy it at this price because
gqEUFZgLw_Y,357450,359160,"I recognize the legend on the keys,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,359160,361503,and I know that you can get boards from this manufacturer
gqEUFZgLw_Y,361503,364919,"for, like, 40 to 45 US dollars,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,364920,367719,but I'm gonna say this one is $60.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,367719,368552,- $44.94.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,369420,370253,- Really?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,370253,371086,- Yeah.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,372690,374250,- With the wrist rest and everything?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,374250,375150,Alright.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,375150,376020,"- I just wanna highlight,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,376020,377520,"I was taking a look through the quick start guide,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,377520,378479,'cause I think quick start guides
gqEUFZgLw_Y,378480,379920,for things like keyboards are funny.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,379920,381690,Here's a way that they cut some costs.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,381690,384000,You can download the software
gqEUFZgLw_Y,384000,385440,at their website
gqEUFZgLw_Y,385440,389400,but do you think that they paid money to get onn.com?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,389400,391139,"- Oh? - No, it's"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,391140,395635,www.onn2.tech.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,395635,398610,(David chuckles)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,398610,399870,- Braided cable.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,399870,401100,Storage for the dongle
gqEUFZgLw_Y,401100,402510,in the base. - [David] Okay!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,402510,404220,"- You got my attention, Onn."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,404220,406367,"- [David] No, you're supposed say, ""You're turning me Onn."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,407250,410160,"- Color-indicated DPI cycling, probably."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,410160,413070,"Forward and back buttons on both sides, it's ambidextrous."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,413070,415650,I'm (sighs) kind of into this.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,415650,418650,"If this is less than, like, 45 bucks,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,418650,420120,then I like it a lot.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,420120,422004,Type C charging!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,422004,423367,- [David] Oh!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,423367,426127,- [Linus] What! - [David] Got Logitech beat!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,426127,427764,- $36.88.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,427764,429130,- [David] What?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,429130,430650,Okay.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,430650,435389,"- Man, we've now done Monoprice, AmazonBasics,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,435390,438420,and I think AliExpress for gaming setups.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,438420,441810,I think Walmart might be coming out ahead right now.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,441810,444000,What are the flipping odds?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,444000,447240,Especially given their inauspicious start in the category.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,447240,448380,- They haven't gone the Amazon route
gqEUFZgLw_Y,448380,449730,of trying to do everything.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,449730,451830,"They have a lot of different stuff under the Onn brand,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,451830,455310,but they're not trying to make 20 different versions
gqEUFZgLw_Y,455310,457169,"of everything, which seems good."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,457170,458700,"This could be for now, though."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,458700,459660,It could get much worse.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,459660,461730,They could end up sprawling and making a bunch of--
gqEUFZgLw_Y,461730,462900,"- Well, we haven't tried any of it yet."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,462900,465210,"- Yeah, still plenty of time for it to be terrible."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,465210,466860,- How much is the wired one?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,466860,468509,"I would guess around the same price,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,468510,470940,given that it has very similar specs.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,470940,473370,"Oh, it does have a different body type."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,473370,474780,"- [Adam] Well, with all the savings they can make"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,474780,476430,"on shipping those lightweight mice,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,476430,477930,they come in at $24.88.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,477930,478889,- Do you have the scale?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,478890,479820,Is the scale here?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,479820,481980,I don't think the lightweight mouse is light.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,481980,485970,"100 grams, and I'm even supporting the cable here."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,485970,487657,How much is the wireless one?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,487657,489180,$110.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,489180,491070,And it has a battery in it. (chuckles)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,491070,494550,"- [Adam] And for context, the super light is 63 grams."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,494550,496379,- Yeah.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,496380,497673,"Alright, see you later."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,498960,500910,"We have much better boxes for our mouse pads,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,500910,501870,just wanna say.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,501870,503699,lttstore.com.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,503700,505350,Much higher quality packaging.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,505350,507900,"Oh God, it's RGB."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,507900,510630,Here's your micro-B power input.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,510630,511463,Alright.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,511463,513060,The top fabric is nothing special.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,513060,514919,"This is a freebie-grade mouse pad,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,514919,516813,but with RGB strapped to it.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,517710,519270,"I would never pay this,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,519270,521347,"but I'm assuming it's, like, 20 bucks."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,521347,522524,- [Adam] $16.88.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,522524,523357,- Okay.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,523357,524550,- [Adam] If you want to stream
gqEUFZgLw_Y,524551,526050,"- (groans) ""Surf Onn"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,526050,530760,"ring light webcam with auto focus, 1440p resolution."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,530760,531593,"- [David] Oh, that's a mistake."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,531593,534300,"- ""And a built-in microphone."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,534300,535890,I think the built-in ring light
gqEUFZgLw_Y,535890,537810,"is probably worth an extra five bucks,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,537810,539850,so I'm saying it's $20.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,539850,544079,- [Adam] The webcam with ring light comes to $29.94
gqEUFZgLw_Y,544080,548130,- Juice Onn wireless charging lamp!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,548130,552090,Charging pad pad wirelessly charges your Qi-enabled device.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,552090,553803,LED charging indicator.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,554880,556557,"Oh, okay!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,556557,558720,You can kind of position it wherever you want.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,558720,561430,"I mean, I'm sure it's not high CRI or whatever, but"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,562500,565200,if you just want a little LED lamp to--
gqEUFZgLw_Y,565200,567930,"Wow, really stays exactly where you put it."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,567930,569250,Very adjustable.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,569250,570303,- [David] What's CRI?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,571410,572243,- CRI...
gqEUFZgLw_Y,572243,574170,"I actually don't know what it stands for,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,574170,575003,but I know that-- - [Brandon] Color rendering
gqEUFZgLw_Y,575003,576384,index! - Sorry?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,576384,578009,- [Brandon] Color rendering index!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,578010,579660,- Color rendering index.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,579660,583410,Basically what it means is that the light outputs
gqEUFZgLw_Y,583410,586949,within a very narrow band of the visible spectrum.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,586950,588600,So you don't just have
gqEUFZgLw_Y,588600,591899,messy wavelengths that are not supposed to be there.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,591900,593310,"- Might not be super accurate,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,593310,595830,"'cause we do have filming light here,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,595830,599400,"but if we get really close, that's 82."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,599400,601080,- That's not bad. - That's actually not terrible
gqEUFZgLw_Y,601080,602430,actually. - But the red channel is
gqEUFZgLw_Y,602430,604290,"really bad. - Right, okay."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,604290,606930,"- So if you're filming, don't buy this light."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,606930,608820,- [Adam] Does the wireless charging work?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,608820,610170,- Only one way to find out.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,611433,614279,(Linus grunts)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,614280,615810,"Yep, immediately. - [Adam] Oh!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,615810,618450,- And for only $19.88!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,618450,619740,- Not bad! - [Adam] Yeah!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,619740,623820,Of course we need some way to listen to audio.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,623820,625590,"- Yeah, 'cause it sure isn't gonna be through the"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,625590,627757,empty speaker holes on our monitor.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,627757,629310,"""Break the silence."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,629310,633000,"The days of lip reading on your PC are over."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,633000,634740,- [David] What? - These better not be
gqEUFZgLw_Y,634740,637140,more than 25 bucks.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,637140,641310,- The speakers with volume and bass control are $19.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,641310,642990,- Nice!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,642990,643823,"- [Adam] But I mean that's-- - Oh, wow."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,643823,644940,"- [Adam] That's been a good trend,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,644940,647560,is that you've been overestimating most
gqEUFZgLw_Y,648799,649890,"of the stuff we're getting. - Well, it's more that I just"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,649890,651840,thought with inflation.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,651840,654270,"You know, cheap, crappy computer speakers"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,654270,656520,were 20 bucks when I was a kid.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,656520,659520,"So I kind of thought, ""Well surely they've gone up a little,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,659520,661650,"I haven't shopped for them since then,"" right?"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,661650,664800,"- And now for the pièce de la résistance,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,664800,666600,the Walmart computer!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,666600,667709,- What?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,667710,670710,"- It doesn't exist, they've been shamed out of existence."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,670710,672930,They don't make any computers anymore.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,672930,675660,"- Really? - Yeah, there's no pre-builts."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,675660,677279,"They don't even have laptops for sale anymore,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,677280,679110,just their tablets.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,679110,680910,- Is this based on parts that are available
gqEUFZgLw_Y,680910,682800,"on Walmart's website, or is this just"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,682800,685002,a test bench for-- - This is just my test bench.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,685002,685962,"- Oh, okay."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,685962,687873,"There we go, it's Onn!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,687874,689250,(Adam laughs sarcastically)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,689250,691380,- [David] It was funny when I did it.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,691380,692730,- What is this wallpaper?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,692730,694230,"I'm sorry, I'm going to-- - [David] That's the Zuck."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,694230,696690,"- [Adam] Hey, no, this is my test bench!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,696690,698550,"I chose my wallpaper! - Oh my God,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,698550,702269,You set this wallpaper and then the activation window closed
gqEUFZgLw_Y,702270,703103,and now it cannot be changed.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,703103,704130,- What can I say?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,704130,706170,"I'm a hacker, man. (laughs)"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,706170,707250,They came! - This has been a while--
gqEUFZgLw_Y,707250,708083,Oh.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,708083,709140,"Oh! - Yeah, they literally"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,709140,710140,"just got delivered. - Oh, this is great!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,710140,711630,We've got our headset.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,711630,714000,"- I think we should maybe consider these for ""WAN Show,"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,714000,715956,'cause I don't know if we have podcast mics.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,715956,716789,(David laughs) - Oh.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,716789,718770,Rechargeable and wireless.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,718770,721890,And based on the pricing I've seen so far I'm gonna guess...
gqEUFZgLw_Y,721890,723510,"I don't know, 65 bucks?"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,723510,725857,- The wireless gaming headset is $52.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,727002,728490,- 52 bucks.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,728490,731010,And I still manage to come in over.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,731010,735450,Comes with both a USB-C charging cable
gqEUFZgLw_Y,735450,738239,and a 3 1/2 millimeter.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,738239,741300,4 pole jack. - [Adam] (chuckles) 4 pole?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,741300,743880,"- Yeah, so well, okay-- - Oh, no it's not four,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,743880,746820,"I was thinking like, like audio file four pole."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,746820,748590,Just because it has the mic on the same plug.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,748590,749520,- Yes. - [Adam] Yeah.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,749520,752260,It's been a while since I've been this impressed by a
gqEUFZgLw_Y,753150,755220,budget product lineup.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,755220,759089,"Every single one of these, I have overestimated the price."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,759090,760380,"- [David] Walmart, you heard it here first."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,760380,761527,Put that on your box.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,761527,763071,"- ""Cheaper than Linus expected."""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,763071,764954,- [David] Yeah. (laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,764955,767100,- And you know what?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,767100,770339,"Holy crap, this is not a TN panel."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,770340,772950,- [David] What? - It's not a good
gqEUFZgLw_Y,772950,774483,non-TN panel.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,776070,777660,But it's not TN.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,777660,780779,I'd say it's IPS 'cause you can really see that blue glow
gqEUFZgLw_Y,780780,782670,when it's off axis.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,782670,786360,"To be clear, that's not a bad thing at all."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,786360,787203,"Wait, onn2.tech?"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,787203,789960,"- [Adam] Ww.onn2.tech. - Wait, holy crap!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,789960,791580,It doesn't even load up a site.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,791580,794525,It just immediately starts downloading the setup software.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,794525,797108,(David laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,799470,800519,- [David] Not sketchy.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,800520,804150,- That is absolutely terrifying.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,804150,805383,"As an end user,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,806280,810060,"If I wasn't making this video, I would not wanna open"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,810060,813240,any file that just automatically downloads
gqEUFZgLw_Y,813240,814620,when I visit a URL.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,814620,815453,It didn't even--
gqEUFZgLw_Y,815453,816480,"Like, look at this!"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,816480,819360,I didn't even realize it was downloading something!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,819360,820503,"Like, watch this."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,823380,826297,It doesn't even change the page I'm on!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,826297,830760,"""Professional sound quality with cardioid recording pattern."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,830760,833730,"Ideal for podcasts, vlogs, and voiceovers."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,833730,834750,Say it again.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,834750,837630,"Testing, testing, is this thing Onn?"""
gqEUFZgLw_Y,837630,839310,"- [David] Damn it, they took the joke from us."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,839310,841860,- This is one of those products where I have seen
gqEUFZgLw_Y,841860,846860,impressive cheap cardioid desktop mics.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,846870,850350,So it's entirely possible this thing doesn't suck.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,850350,852389,That's not bad!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,852390,855690,"Even with this light right behind me, though."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,855690,859320,That is very usable for 30 bucks.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,859320,860460,- [Adam] Have you turned the ring light on?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,860460,861330,- Huh?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,861330,863453,I have no idea how to turn the ring light on.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,863453,864575,(men talking over each other)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,864575,866220,(yelps) What just happened?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,866220,867482,Is it touch? - [David] Oh!
gqEUFZgLw_Y,867482,869370,- (gasps) It's touch! - It's up here.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,869370,870720,There's a label right there.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,870720,872269,- Now let's try the ring light.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,874050,876899,Um... (Adam laughs)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,876900,877950,Underwhelming.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,877950,880530,- [Adam] It's no brighter than your display.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,880530,882060,- Oh wow.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,882060,884310,"Yeah, check this out, David."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,884310,886170,How can you have below zero?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,886170,888000,"For context, let's go ahead and measure"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,888000,889710,one of our studio lights.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,889710,892080,We're at 96 and you can see
gqEUFZgLw_Y,892080,894900,the biggest difference is this red channel here.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,894900,898020,"That's really, really important for natural skin tones"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,898020,899730,"because of all the, you know, blood"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,899730,901500,coursing behind our skin.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,901500,902700,"So, if you have a streaming light"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,902700,905340,"with absolutely no red channel output,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,905340,907590,it shouldn't be surprising that you look like a ghost.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,907590,908970,Or at least I do.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,908970,910709,"We forgot to record the audio, so"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,910710,911850,let's do this again.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,911850,914459,"We're gonna start with the microphone right on the webcam,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,914460,915810,and... (keys clacking)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,915810,917460,- I was supposed to play games
gqEUFZgLw_Y,917460,920490,"like, ""I'm a streamer right now,"" or something like that."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,920490,921630,It's not working very well.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,921630,924360,We just applied a driver update from AMD and
gqEUFZgLw_Y,924360,926640,the game is just not working.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,926640,928590,- So let's switch over to the headset mic
gqEUFZgLw_Y,928590,931950,and I'll give you guys an audio sample from that.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,931950,935100,"And yeah, it's crazy, like I'm firing."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,935100,936690,"I can't see anything, so"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,936690,938550,let's just go back to the Windows desktop
gqEUFZgLw_Y,938550,941130,and let's give the podcaster microphone
gqEUFZgLw_Y,941130,943020,a couple of different chances here.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,943020,946260,"First, from its position right now under the monitor."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,946260,948420,"And then second, there we go."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,948420,950550,If you wanna try and get it a little closer to your mouth
gqEUFZgLw_Y,950550,951810,"in front of the keyboard,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,951810,953490,"it's not the most ergonomic thing ever,"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,953490,955080,but Walmart doesn't have an arm.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,955080,958020,"So as a Walmart gamer, I guess I don't get an arm."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,958020,959130,Give it a chance to kind of
gqEUFZgLw_Y,959130,961200,sound a little richer and more podcast-y.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,961200,962250,I can't hear any of this.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,962250,963870,You guys are gonna have to be the judges.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,963870,965850,"- So, it turns out these microphones are really spicy"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,965850,967829,and you need to turn them way down in Windows
gqEUFZgLw_Y,967830,970770,"to get them not to clip, like, insanely."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,970770,972000,So here's one with them not clipping.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,972000,973260,This is the podcast microphone.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,973260,975390,It's placed right in front of me.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,975390,976950,And then here's some keystrokes
gqEUFZgLw_Y,976950,977820,in the background. (keys clacking)
gqEUFZgLw_Y,977820,979740,"You know, what if I'm typing a message?"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,979740,981720,And then here's the audio for the webcam.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,981720,983939,"Same deal, keystrokes in the background."
gqEUFZgLw_Y,983940,985560,Let us know what you think.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,985560,986580,Hopefully this sounded a little bit better
gqEUFZgLw_Y,986580,988007,than when Linus did it.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,988007,990507,"(""Crab Rave"")"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,994260,996750,"- 13, 14 year old me would've been happier"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,996750,999099,than a pig in (beep) to have a setup like this.
gqEUFZgLw_Y,999099,1001599,"(""Crab Rave"")"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,1004970,1008089,- Would 13 or 14 year old you want one of these?
gqEUFZgLw_Y,1008090,1009380,"- Wait, what is this?"
gqEUFZgLw_Y,1009380,1011450,"- This is what happens when you search ""gaming chair"""
