iBJp57lKtyg,360,2520,- [Narrator] These are the Crawley sisters.
iBJp57lKtyg,2520,4650,"You know them from ""Downton Abbey."""
iBJp57lKtyg,4650,6300,"You may remember this look,"
iBJp57lKtyg,6300,7560,"or this one,"
iBJp57lKtyg,7560,9420,and of course this one.
iBJp57lKtyg,9420,10860,But are they accurate?
iBJp57lKtyg,10860,12599,We got this fashion historian-
iBJp57lKtyg,12600,15750,- I'm Raissa Bretana and I'm a fashion historian.
iBJp57lKtyg,15750,16583,- [Narrator] To walk us through
iBJp57lKtyg,16583,18180,"what ""Downton Abbey"" got right"
iBJp57lKtyg,18180,21270,and what they got mostly right about these looks.
iBJp57lKtyg,21270,23430,"First, let's establish the setting."
iBJp57lKtyg,23430,26370,- The series is set at the fictional Downton estate
iBJp57lKtyg,26370,29580,located in Yorkshire at the early 20th century.
iBJp57lKtyg,29580,32700,We begin season one in April of 1912
iBJp57lKtyg,32700,34410,"with the sinking of the Titanic,"
iBJp57lKtyg,34410,38850,and season six concludes on New Year's Eve of 1925.
iBJp57lKtyg,38850,40739,The show centers around the fictional
iBJp57lKtyg,40740,43080,aristocratic Crawley family.
iBJp57lKtyg,43080,44880,The Crawley sisters were subject
iBJp57lKtyg,44880,47520,to strict social customs of dress
iBJp57lKtyg,47520,50790,which were required of ladies in their social positions.
iBJp57lKtyg,50790,53640,They changed five to seven times a day
iBJp57lKtyg,53640,56460,which required the assistance of a lady's maid.
iBJp57lKtyg,56460,58320,"Repetition of garments was common,"
iBJp57lKtyg,58320,61530,and this is realistically depicted in the show.
iBJp57lKtyg,61530,64229,"Overall, the costume department of ""Downton Abbey"""
iBJp57lKtyg,64230,66840,was dedicated to historical accuracy
iBJp57lKtyg,66840,69450,in their meticulous research of the era.
iBJp57lKtyg,69450,70764,- [Narrator] Let's get into the looks.
iBJp57lKtyg,70764,71940,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,71940,74580,"First up, Sybil's jupe-culotte ensemble."
iBJp57lKtyg,74580,77520,"- This look appears in season one, episode four,"
iBJp57lKtyg,77520,79820,which takes place in May 1913.
iBJp57lKtyg,79820,80653,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,80653,83790,Costume designer Susannah Buxton helped bring to life
iBJp57lKtyg,83790,85740,"this jupe-culotte ensemble,"
iBJp57lKtyg,85740,88549,which was perhaps one of the most memorable costumes
iBJp57lKtyg,88550,89573,of the series.
iBJp57lKtyg,89573,90406,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,90406,93240,The top half of the costume was made from an antique bodice
iBJp57lKtyg,93240,95100,from the early 1910s
iBJp57lKtyg,95100,97260,combined with the metallic lace sleeves
iBJp57lKtyg,97260,99420,of another antique dress.
iBJp57lKtyg,99420,101400,This was an avant-garde ensemble
iBJp57lKtyg,101400,104100,that was meant to shock the Crawley family
iBJp57lKtyg,104100,107760,and demonstrated Sybil's forward-thinking ideals.
iBJp57lKtyg,107760,109440,She's also the character who wears
iBJp57lKtyg,109440,111870,the most avant-garde styles.
iBJp57lKtyg,111870,114930,Her ideals were exemplified by this ensemble
iBJp57lKtyg,114930,117600,because jupe-culottes were often associated
iBJp57lKtyg,117600,119220,"with the women's rights movement,"
iBJp57lKtyg,119220,122148,and that was one that Lady Sybil was passionate about.
iBJp57lKtyg,122148,123360,[cheerful music]
iBJp57lKtyg,123360,125310,- [Narrator] Let's draw Sybil's jupe-culotte look
iBJp57lKtyg,125310,127140,layer by layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,127140,129539,"First up, the undergarments."
iBJp57lKtyg,129539,132780,- The innermost undergarment would either be a combination
iBJp57lKtyg,132780,135450,or a set of chemise and drawers.
iBJp57lKtyg,135450,137610,These undergarments would be made of cotton
iBJp57lKtyg,137610,139620,and would include decorative details
iBJp57lKtyg,139620,141821,like lace or ribbon insertion.
iBJp57lKtyg,141821,142653,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,142654,144210,"- [Narrator] Next up, the stockings."
iBJp57lKtyg,144210,146070,- These stockings would be finely knitted
iBJp57lKtyg,146070,148770,"and fastened above the knee using garters,"
iBJp57lKtyg,148770,150030,which may have been attached
iBJp57lKtyg,150030,151846,to the bottom edge of the corset.
iBJp57lKtyg,151846,152678,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,152679,154650,- [Narrator] And then the corset.
iBJp57lKtyg,154650,157500,"- Despite this shockingly modern ensemble,"
iBJp57lKtyg,157500,159870,a woman of Lady Sybil's social position
iBJp57lKtyg,159870,163290,would still be expected to wear traditional undergarments
iBJp57lKtyg,163290,165299,which did include a corset.
iBJp57lKtyg,165300,169110,"Corsets in 1913 aimed to elongate the torso,"
iBJp57lKtyg,169110,170790,beginning just under the bust
iBJp57lKtyg,170790,173819,and extending down to about mid thigh.
iBJp57lKtyg,173820,178560,"The brassiere, or bra, would be patented in 1914,"
iBJp57lKtyg,178560,182190,but women were not necessarily quick to adopt it.
iBJp57lKtyg,182190,184560,- [Narrator] That brings us to the jupe-culotte layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,184560,188790,- Jupe-culotte literally translates to skirt trousers.
iBJp57lKtyg,188790,191219,"These were loose, voluminous trousers"
iBJp57lKtyg,191220,192690,that gathered at the ankle
iBJp57lKtyg,192690,197690,and were sometimes called Turkish trousers or harem pants.
iBJp57lKtyg,197700,200280,They were championed by such avant-garde designers
iBJp57lKtyg,200280,203430,"as Paul Poiret, whose orientalist designs"
iBJp57lKtyg,203430,206040,from the early 20th century are legendary
iBJp57lKtyg,206040,207584,in fashion history.
iBJp57lKtyg,207585,208418,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,208418,209730,- [Narrator] And now the shoes.
iBJp57lKtyg,209730,212459,- Sybil wears a standard pair of evening shoes
iBJp57lKtyg,212460,215970,from the period which were made of silk with a curved heel
iBJp57lKtyg,215970,217560,and a single strap.
iBJp57lKtyg,217560,219420,"- [Narrator] Next up, gloves."
iBJp57lKtyg,219420,223319,- Lady Sybil wears champagne-colored elbow-length gloves.
iBJp57lKtyg,223320,226350,Women of this social status were expected to wear gloves
iBJp57lKtyg,226350,228060,"with an evening ensemble,"
iBJp57lKtyg,228060,231270,but they would be removed when eating dinner.
iBJp57lKtyg,231270,232950,- [Narrator] What about her hair?
iBJp57lKtyg,232950,235200,"- In this scene, Lady Sybil wears her hair"
iBJp57lKtyg,235200,237120,"in a low twisted chignon,"
iBJp57lKtyg,237120,240989,which would be appropriate for a formal scene in 1913.
iBJp57lKtyg,240990,244530,"However, this wouldn't have necessarily been required of her"
iBJp57lKtyg,244530,246330,at this point in the series.
iBJp57lKtyg,246330,249450,In the first half of season one we occasionally see her
iBJp57lKtyg,249450,253020,"wearing her hair down, and that is because she had not yet"
iBJp57lKtyg,253020,255057,been presented to society.
iBJp57lKtyg,255057,255890,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,255890,257430,"- [Narrator] Finally, the last layer."
iBJp57lKtyg,257430,260669,- Sybil wears a wide metallic-embroidered headband
iBJp57lKtyg,260670,264120,with inset jewel to match her blue ensemble.
iBJp57lKtyg,264120,265919,"According to the costume designer,"
iBJp57lKtyg,265920,269250,this was an original antique piece from the period.
iBJp57lKtyg,269250,272100,"This is accurate, but there is another option"
iBJp57lKtyg,272100,273960,for a fashionable accessory here.
iBJp57lKtyg,273960,276720,Because jupe-culotte ensembles were influenced
iBJp57lKtyg,276720,278280,"by orientalist design,"
iBJp57lKtyg,278280,281310,the most avant-garde women would sometimes opt
iBJp57lKtyg,281310,283560,to wear a fashionable turban instead.
iBJp57lKtyg,283560,285180,"Like Sybil's headpiece,"
iBJp57lKtyg,285180,287550,there was often a central decorative element
iBJp57lKtyg,287550,292110,"like a stone or, more extravagantly, a spray of feathers."
iBJp57lKtyg,292110,294840,This ensemble points to a very specific point
iBJp57lKtyg,294840,297750,in fashion history and it is quite accurate.
iBJp57lKtyg,297750,299520,- [Narrator] So here's what Sybil would've looked like
iBJp57lKtyg,299520,302039,compared to the original look from the series.
iBJp57lKtyg,302040,303930,Pretty much the same!
iBJp57lKtyg,303930,305759,Let's move on to Lady Edith.
iBJp57lKtyg,305760,308670,"- This look appears in season three, episode eight,"
iBJp57lKtyg,308670,312120,which takes place in late summer of 1920.
iBJp57lKtyg,312120,314880,This look by costume designer Caroline McCall
iBJp57lKtyg,314880,319440,was the quintessential mid 1920s daytime city look.
iBJp57lKtyg,319440,321720,"While it is technically accurate,"
iBJp57lKtyg,321720,325020,we would not have seen this in the summer of 1920.
iBJp57lKtyg,325020,327690,This look actually bears closer resemblance
iBJp57lKtyg,327690,331410,to styles from 1923 or '24.
iBJp57lKtyg,331410,334980,We actually see Lady Edith wearing a very similar look
iBJp57lKtyg,334980,338160,with the same hat in the following season.
iBJp57lKtyg,338160,340920,One reason for this design choice may be to create
iBJp57lKtyg,340920,345300,a stark contrast between the wartime realities of season two
iBJp57lKtyg,345300,348449,"and the new urban setting of the London season,"
iBJp57lKtyg,348450,350340,which is season three.
iBJp57lKtyg,350340,351360,- [Narrator] Now we're going to draw
iBJp57lKtyg,351360,352893,every layer of this look.
iBJp57lKtyg,352894,354090,[cheerful music] [image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,354090,355953,"First, the undergarments."
iBJp57lKtyg,357180,359039,- The innermost garment would be a version
iBJp57lKtyg,359040,362280,"of the combination, but overall a bit smaller"
iBJp57lKtyg,362280,363630,and more lightweight.
iBJp57lKtyg,363630,366510,"By 1920, the ideal body was transitioning"
iBJp57lKtyg,366510,369420,into one with de-emphasized curves.
iBJp57lKtyg,369420,371880,It became fashionable to flatten the bust
iBJp57lKtyg,371880,373740,rather than accentuate it.
iBJp57lKtyg,373740,376770,"This is why the corset evolved into the girdle,"
iBJp57lKtyg,376770,379139,which was a lightly boned undergarment
iBJp57lKtyg,379140,382623,that flattened the hips and created a columnar silhouette.
iBJp57lKtyg,383640,385350,- [Narrator] And then the stockings.
iBJp57lKtyg,385350,386910,- Stockings were still worn
iBJp57lKtyg,386910,389820,and were secured using suspender-like garters
iBJp57lKtyg,389820,393270,which were often attached to the bottom edge of the girdle.
iBJp57lKtyg,393270,395039,- [Narrator] Then the third layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,395040,396930,- A slip added a smoothing layer
iBJp57lKtyg,396930,399840,between the undergarments and the outer dress.
iBJp57lKtyg,399840,402389,It would have been loose fitting and boxy
iBJp57lKtyg,402390,405810,to match the silhouette of the dress worn over it.
iBJp57lKtyg,405810,407520,"- [Narrator] Next up, the dress."
iBJp57lKtyg,407520,410910,- Edith's peach shift dress appears to be lightweight
iBJp57lKtyg,410910,413220,"and could have been made of rayon,"
iBJp57lKtyg,413220,417930,which was actually called artificial silk until 1924.
iBJp57lKtyg,417930,420930,The dress features two pleated inset panels
iBJp57lKtyg,420930,422190,and a row of buttons
iBJp57lKtyg,422190,425220,that emphasize the design's verticality.
iBJp57lKtyg,425220,428670,The low slung waistline is a commonly referenced hallmark
iBJp57lKtyg,428670,430740,of 1920s fashion.
iBJp57lKtyg,430740,433410,"However, this is a change that happened gradually,"
iBJp57lKtyg,433410,436410,and it was more common in the mid 1920s.
iBJp57lKtyg,436410,438090,"In the summer of 1920,"
iBJp57lKtyg,438090,440190,the waistline would not have yet reached
iBJp57lKtyg,440190,442110,the level of the hips.
iBJp57lKtyg,442110,446819,"In reality, the dress designs from about 1919 to 1921"
iBJp57lKtyg,446820,449610,were transitional and featured waistlines
iBJp57lKtyg,449610,452009,that sat below the natural waist
iBJp57lKtyg,452010,455100,but still above the level of the hips.
iBJp57lKtyg,455100,457290,"Aside from the placement of the waistline,"
iBJp57lKtyg,457290,459813,Edith's dress is pretty accurate.
iBJp57lKtyg,461040,462420,- [Narrator] What about her coat?
iBJp57lKtyg,462420,464640,- Edith wears a light summer-weight coat
iBJp57lKtyg,464640,465990,which appears to be made
iBJp57lKtyg,465990,469650,of a uniquely woven jacquard or matelasse.
iBJp57lKtyg,469650,472860,It is left open to reveal the dress underneath.
iBJp57lKtyg,472860,475469,The coat is decorated with floral appliques
iBJp57lKtyg,475470,477870,"that match the peach tones of the dress,"
iBJp57lKtyg,477870,480540,and these could have been added by the costume department
iBJp57lKtyg,480540,482880,to an existing vintage coat.
iBJp57lKtyg,482880,485490,"It is incredibly modern and well made,"
iBJp57lKtyg,485490,489330,which speaks to Edith's youth and social position.
iBJp57lKtyg,489330,491069,- [Narrator] And then the shoes.
iBJp57lKtyg,491070,492840,- Edith's shoes are light colored
iBJp57lKtyg,492840,494730,and likely made of leather.
iBJp57lKtyg,494730,497010,They feature a sturdy heel and a strap
iBJp57lKtyg,497010,500250,which would've been appropriate for her life in the city.
iBJp57lKtyg,500250,502320,"- [Narrator] Next up, Edith's hair."
iBJp57lKtyg,502320,505410,"- Edith's hair remains long, but it's styled in a way"
iBJp57lKtyg,505410,508350,to create the look of the fashionable shorter hairstyles
iBJp57lKtyg,508350,509250,of the period.
iBJp57lKtyg,509250,512969,"This style is called a finger wave or Marcel wave,"
iBJp57lKtyg,512969,515490,"and it is achieved using a curling iron,"
iBJp57lKtyg,515490,519060,which we see Anna practicing with in season two.
iBJp57lKtyg,519060,520740,This style could also be achieved
iBJp57lKtyg,520740,525000,by using a combination of pomade and wave clips.
iBJp57lKtyg,525000,526860,- [Narrator] And of course the hat.
iBJp57lKtyg,526860,530250,- Edith wears a light colored hat with an upturned brim
iBJp57lKtyg,530250,533610,and a peach hat band to coordinate with her ensemble.
iBJp57lKtyg,533610,536820,"During the early 1920s, hat brims became narrower"
iBJp57lKtyg,536820,539190,and started to fit closer to the head.
iBJp57lKtyg,539190,540540,This would eventually give way
iBJp57lKtyg,540540,542339,to the bell-shaped cloche style
iBJp57lKtyg,542340,545340,which became synonymous with the time period.
iBJp57lKtyg,545340,547590,"Overall, Edith blossoms in London"
iBJp57lKtyg,547590,549270,and her clothes reflect that
iBJp57lKtyg,549270,552330,of a smartly dressed urban woman of the era.
iBJp57lKtyg,552330,554070,- [Narrator] So this is what Edith would've looked like
iBJp57lKtyg,554070,555420,compared to the original.
iBJp57lKtyg,555420,557763,"Again, almost exactly the same."
iBJp57lKtyg,558649,559482,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,559482,561720,"Finally, let's take a look at Mary's gown."
iBJp57lKtyg,561720,564660,"- This look appears in season six, episode nine,"
iBJp57lKtyg,564660,566579,"which is the series finale,"
iBJp57lKtyg,566580,570030,and this takes place in December of 1925.
iBJp57lKtyg,570030,572550,The last two seasons and the film were designed
iBJp57lKtyg,572550,574470,by Anna Mary Scott Robbins
iBJp57lKtyg,574470,577139,and were set at the height of the Jazz Age.
iBJp57lKtyg,577140,579600,At this point of the series we see costumes
iBJp57lKtyg,579600,583980,that audiences can readily identify as the 1920s.
iBJp57lKtyg,583980,588269,"Actress Michelle Dockery wore a real antique Fortuny gown,"
iBJp57lKtyg,588270,590100,which was a treat to see on screen
iBJp57lKtyg,590100,593490,because these garments are usually meticulously preserved
iBJp57lKtyg,593490,595500,in museum collections.
iBJp57lKtyg,595500,598680,This was the first time a Delphos gown was ever worn
iBJp57lKtyg,598680,600540,in a television series.
iBJp57lKtyg,600540,602670,"It was lent by the Fortuny archive,"
iBJp57lKtyg,602670,607380,along with two velvet coats worn by Lady Mary and Lady Rose.
iBJp57lKtyg,607380,611010,This ensemble is true to Lady Mary's character.
iBJp57lKtyg,611010,613560,She's a woman a very refined taste
iBJp57lKtyg,613560,615900,who prefers streamlined simplicity
iBJp57lKtyg,615900,618420,over excessive ornamentation.
iBJp57lKtyg,618420,620703,- [Narrator] Let's draw Mary's look layer by layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,620703,621536,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,621536,623430,"First up, undergarments."
iBJp57lKtyg,623430,626250,- Lady Mary has the fashionably slender figure
iBJp57lKtyg,626250,628410,for the period and wouldn't require
iBJp57lKtyg,628410,631440,any extensive undergarments for shaping.
iBJp57lKtyg,631440,633300,Her undergarments may have consisted
iBJp57lKtyg,633300,635700,of a simple bandeau-style brassiere
iBJp57lKtyg,635700,637650,and a pair of short drawers.
iBJp57lKtyg,637650,640620,This style of bra was popular during the 1920s
iBJp57lKtyg,640620,643290,and was worn by women who naturally possessed
iBJp57lKtyg,643290,645839,the fashionably flat chest.
iBJp57lKtyg,645840,647580,- [Narrator] Let's move on to the next layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,647580,651480,- She would be wearing silk stocking secured with garters.
iBJp57lKtyg,651480,653730,These garters would've been elasticated
iBJp57lKtyg,653730,657300,and incorporated some sort of decorative trimming.
iBJp57lKtyg,657300,658860,"- [Narrator] Perhaps the most impressive layer,"
iBJp57lKtyg,658860,660750,the Fortuny Delphos gown.
iBJp57lKtyg,660750,664290,- The Delphos gown was designed by Mariano Fortuny
iBJp57lKtyg,664290,667320,and so called for its resemblance to the garment worn
iBJp57lKtyg,667320,669637,by the ancient Greek bronze sculpture
iBJp57lKtyg,669637,671940,"""The Charioteer at Delphi."""
iBJp57lKtyg,671940,675630,It was made from two rectangular panels of dyed silk
iBJp57lKtyg,675630,678990,which were intricately pleated using a system of machinery
iBJp57lKtyg,678990,681839,that Fortuny patented in 1909.
iBJp57lKtyg,681840,683850,"Since then, the method of pleating"
iBJp57lKtyg,683850,685649,has been one of fashion history's
iBJp57lKtyg,685650,687960,most closely guarded secrets.
iBJp57lKtyg,687960,691080,"The side seams and shoulder seams were not sewn,"
iBJp57lKtyg,691080,695100,but rather fastened with a series of pins called fibulae.
iBJp57lKtyg,695100,698100,Lady Mary wears a variation of the Delphos gown
iBJp57lKtyg,698100,702300,known as the peplos which featured a short tunic layer.
iBJp57lKtyg,702300,705930,Small Venetian glass beads were stitched to the bottom edge
iBJp57lKtyg,705930,708660,to weigh down the hem and to preserve the straight line
iBJp57lKtyg,708660,709680,of the garment.
iBJp57lKtyg,709680,711810,It's essential to note that the Delphos gown
iBJp57lKtyg,711810,714720,was originally designed as a tea gown.
iBJp57lKtyg,714720,717149,The tea gown was an Edwardian-era garment
iBJp57lKtyg,717150,720300,that was worn by society women in the home.
iBJp57lKtyg,720300,723209,"In 1909, Fortuny was shocked to find out"
iBJp57lKtyg,723210,725220,that society's boldest women
iBJp57lKtyg,725220,728699,were actually wearing their Delphos gowns out of the house.
iBJp57lKtyg,728700,732150,"By the mid 1920s, it became common for modern women"
iBJp57lKtyg,732150,734580,to wear them as evening dresses.
iBJp57lKtyg,734580,738000,"Because she is wearing an actual garment from the period,"
iBJp57lKtyg,738000,741120,it really doesn't get more accurate than this.
iBJp57lKtyg,741120,742950,"- [Narrator] Next up, the shoes."
iBJp57lKtyg,742950,746610,"- We never see Mary's shoes in this scene, but we can assume"
iBJp57lKtyg,746610,749220,that she's wearing some type of silk evening shoe
iBJp57lKtyg,749220,752490,with a curved heel and a decorative element.
iBJp57lKtyg,752490,754200,- [Narrator] And then the hair.
iBJp57lKtyg,754200,757470,"- In season five, Lady Mary cuts her long hair"
iBJp57lKtyg,757470,759959,into a stylish shingle bob.
iBJp57lKtyg,759960,762750,This style is notable for its angular sides
iBJp57lKtyg,762750,765000,that accentuate the cheek bones.
iBJp57lKtyg,765000,768150,The back of the bob is cropped high above the hairline
iBJp57lKtyg,768150,770310,with a pointed base at the nape.
iBJp57lKtyg,770310,773190,This hairstyle was favored by film flappers
iBJp57lKtyg,773190,776280,like Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks.
iBJp57lKtyg,776280,778110,"- [Narrator] Finally, her jewelry."
iBJp57lKtyg,778110,781829,"- Lady Mary wears a thin headband across her forehead,"
iBJp57lKtyg,781830,783750,and these headpieces were standard
iBJp57lKtyg,783750,785940,for evening dress in the 1920s.
iBJp57lKtyg,785940,788460,"She occasionally wears a tiara to dinner,"
iBJp57lKtyg,788460,790110,which was an accessory reserved
iBJp57lKtyg,790110,792450,for married aristocratic women.
iBJp57lKtyg,792450,795060,She also wears a long chain necklace
iBJp57lKtyg,795060,797070,which was favored during this time period
iBJp57lKtyg,797070,800760,because it emphasized the fashionable flatness of the chest.
iBJp57lKtyg,800760,802800,And she wears long drop earrings
iBJp57lKtyg,802800,804930,that dangle below her bobbed hair.
iBJp57lKtyg,804930,807750,"Overall, her jewelry is very understated"
iBJp57lKtyg,807750,811380,which reflects her preference for elegance and simplicity.
iBJp57lKtyg,811380,816150,Lady Mary's look is perfection and absolutely accurate.
iBJp57lKtyg,816150,817860,- [Narrator] So this is what Mary would've looked like
iBJp57lKtyg,817860,820230,compared to the look in the series finale.
iBJp57lKtyg,820230,821548,Very accurate!
iBJp57lKtyg,821549,822382,[image whooshing]
iBJp57lKtyg,822382,823950,Any final thoughts?
iBJp57lKtyg,823950,826860,"- Overall, ""Downton Abbey"" is the gold standard"
iBJp57lKtyg,826860,828390,for period dramas
iBJp57lKtyg,828390,832322,with particular enthusiasm placed on the costumes.
