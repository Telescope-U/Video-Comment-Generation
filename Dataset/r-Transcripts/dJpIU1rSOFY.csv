dJpIU1rSOFY,13295,14562,"You're laughing, right? "
dJpIU1rSOFY,14763,16004,Watching me tumble like that? 
dJpIU1rSOFY,16406,17453,Are you? 
dJpIU1rSOFY,19091,21596,"Oh! No no, go ahead!"
dJpIU1rSOFY,23338,26245,"But hey, do you know  what just happened? "
dJpIU1rSOFY,29466,31038,There we go again!
dJpIU1rSOFY,31955,37282,"Well, this is nothing but an  earthquake, a small one indeed. "
dJpIU1rSOFY,37755,41332,"Come, let me tell you  about Earthquakes today! "
dJpIU1rSOFY,42140,43272,Zoom In!
dJpIU1rSOFY,44377,47656,The surface of the Earth is like a jigsaw puzzle.
dJpIU1rSOFY,48258,50803,"Yes, it's not a single piece of land"
dJpIU1rSOFY,51104,55864,"but approximately 20 pieces  of a puzzle that constantly move,"
dJpIU1rSOFY,56465,60470,but you don't feel it because  they move quite slowly.
dJpIU1rSOFY,61071,65129,Each of one those puzzle pieces are called 'Tectonic Plates'.
dJpIU1rSOFY,66128,68522,So whenever those plates hit
dJpIU1rSOFY,69464,75086,"bump or slide past another plate,  an earthquake is caused!"
dJpIU1rSOFY,75787,81459,The surface where these plates slip is called the Fault or the Fault plane. 
dJpIU1rSOFY,82301,84446,So when do you think it happens? 
dJpIU1rSOFY,85479,88212,"Well, it happens all the time! "
dJpIU1rSOFY,89659,91633,"But hey, don't be scared. "
dJpIU1rSOFY,92081,97166,"Most of the times, we don't feel the quakes  as they are too small to reach us."
dJpIU1rSOFY,98870,105407,"But sometimes, they are so strong  that they can be felt over 1000 miles away."
dJpIU1rSOFY,106725,111442,The place where the earthquake originates is called the Hypocentre
dJpIU1rSOFY,111543,116335,and the place where it occurs on the  Earth's surface is called the Epicenter.
dJpIU1rSOFY,117498,119722,There are three types of Earthquakes.
dJpIU1rSOFY,120646,122122,Convergent boundary.
dJpIU1rSOFY,122901,127920,"Here, one plate is forced over another  during an earthquake,"
dJpIU1rSOFY,128220,130442,which causes a Thrust Fault 
dJpIU1rSOFY,131328,133583,Many hills and mountains have been formed
dJpIU1rSOFY,133784,136118,due to the Convergent Boundary.
dJpIU1rSOFY,136919,138419,Divergent boundary
dJpIU1rSOFY,139078,142472,"Here, plates are drifted apart  from each other, "
dJpIU1rSOFY,142673,144209,forming a Rift Zone. 
dJpIU1rSOFY,145027,148361,This kind gives birth to new ocean floors. 
dJpIU1rSOFY,149427,150891,Transform fault
dJpIU1rSOFY,151408,156979,"Here, the plates here slip by each other  and this is also called Strike-Slip."
dJpIU1rSOFY,158575,162495,"So earthquakes are nothing  but the shaking, "
dJpIU1rSOFY,163335,167979,rolling or a sudden shock of the  earth's surface. 
dJpIU1rSOFY,169180,172859,"Now you know that whenever  the Earth is stressed or angry,"
dJpIU1rSOFY,172860,175151,it shakes and grumbles! 
dJpIU1rSOFY,177518,180462,"Don't be scared, I was just kidding"
dJpIU1rSOFY,184133,185905,The instrument used by Scientists
dJpIU1rSOFY,185906,190121,to measure the intensity of Earthquake is known as a Seismograph!
dJpIU1rSOFY,190790,195299,A Tsunami is caused when earthquakes occur under water.
dJpIU1rSOFY,198942,202706,Yikes! I need to rush before I tumble again. 
dJpIU1rSOFY,202707,207937,So this is me Zooming out. Tune in next time for more fun facts.
