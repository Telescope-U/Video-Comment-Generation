AveV9L0v83A,14559,16960,what we're told are still in meltdown
AveV9L0v83A,16960,19600,mode we're going to shift gears and talk
AveV9L0v83A,19600,21920,about food supplies
AveV9L0v83A,21920,24640,and crop conditions because the country
AveV9L0v83A,24640,27199,has been experiencing a lot of drought
AveV9L0v83A,27199,28880,and a lot of heat
AveV9L0v83A,28880,31279,and some of the crops just aren't faring
AveV9L0v83A,31279,33280,very well and so i want to talk about
AveV9L0v83A,33280,35520,that you know even here we we went about
AveV9L0v83A,35520,37280,a month here at the homestead without
AveV9L0v83A,37280,38960,any kind of precipitation at all we
AveV9L0v83A,38960,40879,finally got some yesterday morning and
AveV9L0v83A,40879,43360,the evening before and while it wasn't a
AveV9L0v83A,43360,45200,complete soaker it was certainly a
AveV9L0v83A,45200,47920,relief and and needed amount of moisture
AveV9L0v83A,47920,50399,that we got uh and the the biggest
AveV9L0v83A,50399,53039,benefit at least in the immediate is
AveV9L0v83A,53039,55199,that today is just an absolutely
AveV9L0v83A,55199,58160,beautiful uh you know ozark day i mean

AveV9L0v83A,62160,64720,so we're very thankful for that uh but
AveV9L0v83A,64720,66240,there's certain places in the country
AveV9L0v83A,66240,68159,that just aren't doing very good and so
AveV9L0v83A,68159,69680,we want to talk about that here in just

AveV9L0v83A,152640,154800,create community uh it's it's a very
AveV9L0v83A,154800,156800,needed thing especially in the times
AveV9L0v83A,156800,158800,that we are living in
AveV9L0v83A,158800,161280,so let's talk about the the crop uh
AveV9L0v83A,161280,162800,reports that are that are starting to
AveV9L0v83A,162800,164080,come out you know things have been in
AveV9L0v83A,164080,165760,the ground planted long enough that
AveV9L0v83A,165760,168720,we're starting to see the results um
AveV9L0v83A,168720,169680,of
AveV9L0v83A,169680,172319,shortages and of droughts and of heat
AveV9L0v83A,172319,174879,and while some of the country is doing
AveV9L0v83A,174879,177040,okay i mean i can't get on here and
AveV9L0v83A,177040,178879,honestly say the whole country is
AveV9L0v83A,178879,182319,experiencing apocalyptic levels of you
AveV9L0v83A,182319,183120,know
AveV9L0v83A,183120,185280,uh crop failures it's not like that
AveV9L0v83A,185280,187599,there are certainly areas of the country
AveV9L0v83A,187599,189360,that are doing good but there's areas
AveV9L0v83A,189360,191440,that are doing really bad
AveV9L0v83A,191440,192640,and
AveV9L0v83A,192640,194239,we have to put this into perspective
AveV9L0v83A,194239,196159,we're dealing with shortages on an
AveV9L0v83A,196159,198400,international level because of wars
AveV9L0v83A,198400,199840,because of
AveV9L0v83A,199840,201680,people you know certain countries you
AveV9L0v83A,201680,203760,know choosing to not export or limit
AveV9L0v83A,203760,205200,their exports
AveV9L0v83A,205200,207120,we're dealing with several countries
AveV9L0v83A,207120,209040,that are that are also dealing with
AveV9L0v83A,209040,211760,drought conditions and excessive heat
AveV9L0v83A,211760,214000,and then we're dealing with shortages of
AveV9L0v83A,214000,216560,certain items that are very necessary in
AveV9L0v83A,216560,218799,the farming industry you know chemicals
AveV9L0v83A,218799,220799,fertilizers fuel
AveV9L0v83A,220799,222000,parts
AveV9L0v83A,222000,224239,and even labor so
AveV9L0v83A,224239,226879,when you put it all in a big picture
AveV9L0v83A,226879,229440,and you start to see areas have really
AveV9L0v83A,229440,232480,poor crop conditions um it's definitely
AveV9L0v83A,232480,235120,going to exacerbate the the whole system
AveV9L0v83A,235120,237439,um again this isn't a complete
AveV9L0v83A,237439,239599,nationwide crop failure but we're seeing
AveV9L0v83A,239599,241519,some areas that are just doing pretty
AveV9L0v83A,241519,242400,poor
AveV9L0v83A,242400,244879,and then i'm also receiving emails from
AveV9L0v83A,244879,247040,people that are commenting on what's
AveV9L0v83A,247040,248640,going on what they're seeing in their
AveV9L0v83A,248640,251040,area and they're seeing corn that's
AveV9L0v83A,251040,253200,nowhere near the height that it normally
AveV9L0v83A,253200,255599,is by this time of the year or fields
AveV9L0v83A,255599,257840,that look pretty dead
AveV9L0v83A,257840,259919,whether it be because of drought or
AveV9L0v83A,259919,261600,they're you know they're used to putting
AveV9L0v83A,261600,263680,fertilizers on it and they're it's not
AveV9L0v83A,263680,264800,happening
AveV9L0v83A,264800,266560,kansas
AveV9L0v83A,266560,268160,is the state that seems to be doing
AveV9L0v83A,268160,270000,pretty bad right now of course you all
AveV9L0v83A,270000,271919,remember a couple weeks ago all the
AveV9L0v83A,271919,273600,cattle that were falling over dead in
AveV9L0v83A,273600,276960,kansas um their their wheat report is
AveV9L0v83A,276960,278960,pretty poor right now we're looking at
AveV9L0v83A,278960,280720,it like 40
AveV9L0v83A,280720,283440,uh at least that's what the usda is is
AveV9L0v83A,283440,284560,reporting
AveV9L0v83A,284560,286400,that around 40
AveV9L0v83A,286400,287600,um
AveV9L0v83A,287600,289440,of kansas wheat their winter wheat
AveV9L0v83A,289440,292880,harvest is is either uh poor or just
AveV9L0v83A,292880,294720,completely bad condition i mean it's
AveV9L0v83A,294720,297520,it's just not in good shape at all
AveV9L0v83A,297520,299280,and that's pretty significant when you
AveV9L0v83A,299280,302320,consider that kansas
AveV9L0v83A,302320,305600,amounts to about a quarter of the winter
AveV9L0v83A,305600,307120,wheat production here in the united
AveV9L0v83A,307120,309360,states so it's a state that produces a
AveV9L0v83A,309360,310800,lot of wheat
AveV9L0v83A,310800,313120,and their wheat uh conditions are pretty
AveV9L0v83A,313120,315360,poor uh this year because of just the
AveV9L0v83A,315360,316800,heat and the drought
AveV9L0v83A,316800,318720,texas and new mexico they're dealing
AveV9L0v83A,318720,321039,with a lot of the same problems texas is
AveV9L0v83A,321039,323199,getting hit pretty hard this year when
AveV9L0v83A,323199,326000,it comes to crop conditions
AveV9L0v83A,326000,328560,they're they're just across the board
AveV9L0v83A,328560,330960,when it comes to the areas that grow
AveV9L0v83A,330960,333039,crops they're doing really bad
AveV9L0v83A,333039,334639,and most of it's due to the doubt
AveV9L0v83A,334639,335600,drought
AveV9L0v83A,335600,337680,texas is experiencing excessive and
AveV9L0v83A,337680,340639,extreme drought conditions throughout
AveV9L0v83A,340639,343520,a large large portion of the state
AveV9L0v83A,343520,346080,and and this is not good because texas
AveV9L0v83A,346080,349840,is a major a major farming state and and
AveV9L0v83A,349840,352000,even the areas that are producing cattle
AveV9L0v83A,352000,354240,they're probably going to be hurting
AveV9L0v83A,354240,355840,especially come later on this year
AveV9L0v83A,355840,358800,because the hay production in in kansas
AveV9L0v83A,358800,361840,or in texas is just absolutely awful uh
AveV9L0v83A,361840,363840,they're we're looking at a serious
AveV9L0v83A,363840,365440,failures in a lot of areas in hay
AveV9L0v83A,365440,366479,production
AveV9L0v83A,366479,368319,some of it's the drought that's causing
AveV9L0v83A,368319,370560,it and then there's also the factor of
AveV9L0v83A,370560,373280,of the lack of fertilizer
AveV9L0v83A,373280,374639,that we're seeing
AveV9L0v83A,374639,376720,all across the country and so we're it's
AveV9L0v83A,376720,378000,something that i've been talking about
AveV9L0v83A,378000,381680,for a while on here uh come this fall
AveV9L0v83A,381680,384319,when farmers start stocking up uh you
AveV9L0v83A,384319,387280,know and and wrapping up their hay uh
AveV9L0v83A,387280,389039,for the year so that they have enough to
AveV9L0v83A,389039,390560,keep their cattle alive for the
AveV9L0v83A,390560,392560,wintertime uh things are gonna start
AveV9L0v83A,392560,395759,getting pretty hard because um
AveV9L0v83A,395759,397199,there's just not going to be enough hay
AveV9L0v83A,397199,398720,there's there's not enough that's being
AveV9L0v83A,398720,400560,produced part of it again it's because
AveV9L0v83A,400560,402639,of drought and heat and the other part
AveV9L0v83A,402639,405520,is is the vast majority of hay farmers
AveV9L0v83A,405520,408240,they use fertilizer and i have heard
AveV9L0v83A,408240,410400,locally and all across the nation
AveV9L0v83A,410400,412720,whether through personal contacts or
AveV9L0v83A,412720,414160,through the news
AveV9L0v83A,414160,415919,that there's just not enough fertilizer
AveV9L0v83A,415919,417599,for these farmers to put on their hay
AveV9L0v83A,417599,419680,and they're expecting numbers of
AveV9L0v83A,419680,421759,hay reduction numbers of 30 to 40
AveV9L0v83A,421759,423919,percent simply because of the lack of
AveV9L0v83A,423919,425759,fertilizer and that's not adding
AveV9L0v83A,425759,428160,factoring in uh areas that are dealing
AveV9L0v83A,428160,430720,with excessive heat and drought now and
AveV9L0v83A,430720,432560,so come this winter a lot of these
AveV9L0v83A,432560,434000,farmers are going to have to be making
AveV9L0v83A,434000,436160,some hard choices you know how much of
AveV9L0v83A,436160,437919,their herd to keep
AveV9L0v83A,437919,440560,uh or how much of it to to let go and
AveV9L0v83A,440560,442800,and send to the butcher because they
AveV9L0v83A,442800,445120,don't have the hay to keep them
AveV9L0v83A,445120,448240,alive or maybe they can't afford the hay
AveV9L0v83A,448240,450080,because the prices have skyrocketed
AveV9L0v83A,450080,452400,which is what many farmers i've talked
AveV9L0v83A,452400,454080,to several farmers here locally and
AveV9L0v83A,454080,455280,that's what they believe is going to
AveV9L0v83A,455280,457360,happen uh that's that's what they're all
AveV9L0v83A,457360,459680,planning for and i've talked to at least
AveV9L0v83A,459680,462639,three or four uh beef cattle farmers
AveV9L0v83A,462639,464160,that are telling me that they're they're
AveV9L0v83A,464160,467199,already trying to do the math and figure
AveV9L0v83A,467199,468879,out how many of their cattle that they
AveV9L0v83A,468879,471520,need to send off to the slaughterhouse
AveV9L0v83A,471520,472800,because they're just not going to be
AveV9L0v83A,472800,474960,able to afford to keep their herds alive
AveV9L0v83A,474960,476319,all winter long
AveV9L0v83A,476319,478639,and this is going to have some
AveV9L0v83A,478639,481199,you know long-term replica you know
AveV9L0v83A,481199,483039,problems repercussions to to the whole
AveV9L0v83A,483039,484479,system uh
AveV9L0v83A,484479,487120,you and ive the consumer and i
AveV9L0v83A,487120,488960,understand some of your farmers uh big
AveV9L0v83A,488960,491120,farmers but i'm saying the the consumers
AveV9L0v83A,491120,492639,they're seeing what's happening right
AveV9L0v83A,492639,495440,now and we're hearing reports of
AveV9L0v83A,495440,497120,shortages and we're seeing the food
AveV9L0v83A,497120,498879,prices increase and we're seeing the
AveV9L0v83A,498879,501120,shelves empty and
AveV9L0v83A,501120,503039,and while it's it's uncomfortable for
AveV9L0v83A,503039,505919,certain uh at in the very least uh you
AveV9L0v83A,505919,508800,you have to understand that the food
AveV9L0v83A,508800,510560,that you're eating right now the vast
AveV9L0v83A,510560,513279,majority of it was last year's food and
AveV9L0v83A,513279,514399,last year
AveV9L0v83A,514399,517360,was a decent year for farming it wasn't
AveV9L0v83A,517360,519279,you know a bumper crop and it wasn't
AveV9L0v83A,519279,521200,everything perfect but it was a decent
AveV9L0v83A,521200,522000,year
AveV9L0v83A,522000,524640,this year has gotten a lot worse and so
AveV9L0v83A,524640,527680,the food that's being produced this year
AveV9L0v83A,527680,529680,a lot of it it's going to get hit to
AveV9L0v83A,529680,532399,your your shelves and your table next
AveV9L0v83A,532399,534800,year which means next year's going to be
AveV9L0v83A,534800,536080,really bad
AveV9L0v83A,536080,537680,and that's what everyone is believing
AveV9L0v83A,537680,541760,that 2023 and 2024 when it comes to food
AveV9L0v83A,541760,543600,it's going to be significantly worse
AveV9L0v83A,543600,545760,than what we're dealing with right now
AveV9L0v83A,545760,546720,so
AveV9L0v83A,546720,548640,that's another reason to keep keep
AveV9L0v83A,548640,550320,prepping i mean you go to the store and
AveV9L0v83A,550320,552640,you're seeing the high prices of food i
AveV9L0v83A,552640,554000,assure you
AveV9L0v83A,554000,556320,those food prices are going to get much
AveV9L0v83A,556320,558720,higher so even though you know your
AveV9L0v83A,558720,561040,dollar isn't going as far
AveV9L0v83A,561040,563279,when you're trying to stock up right now
AveV9L0v83A,563279,565040,you should still do as much as you
AveV9L0v83A,565040,567360,possibly can even if you have to cut
AveV9L0v83A,567360,569040,back in other areas
AveV9L0v83A,569040,571200,because come next year
AveV9L0v83A,571200,573279,yeah it's gonna it's gonna get probably
AveV9L0v83A,573279,575600,pretty pretty bad
AveV9L0v83A,575600,577440,another thing that's that's a hurt in
AveV9L0v83A,577440,579200,farming right now is the lack of
AveV9L0v83A,579200,580880,chemicals so we've been talking about
AveV9L0v83A,580880,583440,fertile fertilizer talking about fuel
AveV9L0v83A,583440,584959,shortages which is
AveV9L0v83A,584959,587120,drastically increasing
AveV9L0v83A,587120,589200,the cost of farming i've heard from
AveV9L0v83A,589200,592000,several farmers that um
AveV9L0v83A,592000,594000,personally and online that they're
AveV9L0v83A,594000,595040,saying that
AveV9L0v83A,595040,597360,just the fuel costs alone is making it
AveV9L0v83A,597360,599040,very difficult like they're not even
AveV9L0v83A,599040,601040,sure that they're gonna even make a
AveV9L0v83A,601040,602480,profit this year
AveV9L0v83A,602480,604720,uh that you know some of these farmers
AveV9L0v83A,604720,606640,are saying that it a lot of people
AveV9L0v83A,606640,608560,probably just going to break even so
AveV9L0v83A,608560,610079,you've got those factors but then the
AveV9L0v83A,610079,611360,other thing is just the lack of
AveV9L0v83A,611360,613760,chemicals now i don't like chemical
AveV9L0v83A,613760,615680,fertilizers we don't use any kind of
AveV9L0v83A,615680,618160,chemical fertilizers here on our farm
AveV9L0v83A,618160,619760,we're completely organic we're not
AveV9L0v83A,619760,622079,certified you don't need to be certified
AveV9L0v83A,622079,623760,but we're completely organic because i
AveV9L0v83A,623760,626880,don't like it but the fact is
AveV9L0v83A,626880,628480,for this country in this world to
AveV9L0v83A,628480,630560,produce the amount of food that the
AveV9L0v83A,630560,634000,system is used to having and has built
AveV9L0v83A,634000,635120,around
AveV9L0v83A,635120,637920,unfortunately those chemical fertilizers
AveV9L0v83A,637920,640079,are necessary to produce that and
AveV9L0v83A,640079,643040,there's a shortage of those also and so
AveV9L0v83A,643040,645120,these farmers aren't able to put the
AveV9L0v83A,645120,647440,pesticides
AveV9L0v83A,647440,650640,and chemical fertilizers and herbicides
AveV9L0v83A,650640,652480,and things like that on their crops that
AveV9L0v83A,652480,653760,they're used to
AveV9L0v83A,653760,656000,and so they're expecting
AveV9L0v83A,656000,658480,less return they're expecting a smaller
AveV9L0v83A,658480,660880,harvest because the increase in pests
AveV9L0v83A,660880,663200,the increase in weeds
AveV9L0v83A,663200,665680,and and there is there's a possibility
AveV9L0v83A,665680,667760,and i'm no expert in this so don't take
AveV9L0v83A,667760,669920,it my word for this
AveV9L0v83A,669920,672480,but in just my research there are those
AveV9L0v83A,672480,673760,that believe
AveV9L0v83A,673760,675440,because
AveV9L0v83A,675440,678000,the bugs and the weeds have been so used
AveV9L0v83A,678000,680800,to having those chemicals put on them if
AveV9L0v83A,680800,683519,we take them away very abruptly
AveV9L0v83A,683519,686079,we could see an explosion
AveV9L0v83A,686079,688959,of the bugs and explosion of the weeds
AveV9L0v83A,688959,692160,um whereas you know for instance us here
AveV9L0v83A,692160,694399,we don't use them we're able to manage
AveV9L0v83A,694399,697440,them in other ways uh on it on a yearly
AveV9L0v83A,697440,699760,basis so if you take them away in an
AveV9L0v83A,699760,702160,abrupt way in areas that that's what
AveV9L0v83A,702160,703839,they're used to
AveV9L0v83A,703839,706240,it could potentially cause an explosion
AveV9L0v83A,706240,708880,of those pests and parasites and bugs
AveV9L0v83A,708880,710160,and weeds
AveV9L0v83A,710160,712079,which is in the end
AveV9L0v83A,712079,714959,going to hurt uh the harvest
AveV9L0v83A,714959,717360,so folks
AveV9L0v83A,717360,719680,this i i know i get a lot of people all
AveV9L0v83A,719680,722480,your doomsday videos trust me this isn't
AveV9L0v83A,722480,724959,doomsday yet folks um
AveV9L0v83A,724959,727279,here in another year or so you might be
AveV9L0v83A,727279,729519,seeing some more doomsday real doomsday
AveV9L0v83A,729519,731440,videos from me but right now this isn't
AveV9L0v83A,731440,733519,doomsday this is warning you this is
AveV9L0v83A,733519,736160,letting you know um that that things
AveV9L0v83A,736160,738480,don't look real great down the road
AveV9L0v83A,738480,740480,again there are certain areas that are
AveV9L0v83A,740480,742480,certainly doing pretty good
AveV9L0v83A,742480,744240,but there's areas down south there's
AveV9L0v83A,744240,747279,areas up north also areas in in illinois
AveV9L0v83A,747279,748160,and and
AveV9L0v83A,748160,750079,minnesota and even in the dakotas
AveV9L0v83A,750079,752079,there's certain areas that aren't doing
AveV9L0v83A,752079,754000,that great uh when it comes to their
AveV9L0v83A,754000,755920,crop productions this year so you put it
AveV9L0v83A,755920,758399,all together with everything else that's
AveV9L0v83A,758399,759519,going on
AveV9L0v83A,759519,761839,it doesn't look very good and so i
AveV9L0v83A,761839,763920,encourage you to to take the time that
AveV9L0v83A,763920,765120,you have
AveV9L0v83A,765120,766720,because you may not have a whole lot
AveV9L0v83A,766720,767839,time left
AveV9L0v83A,767839,770240,to start stocking up
AveV9L0v83A,770240,772800,and again this video is just focused on
AveV9L0v83A,772800,774639,crop production we're not even talking
AveV9L0v83A,774639,777279,about the increase that you all know
AveV9L0v83A,777279,779279,about it all the increased riots and
AveV9L0v83A,779279,780320,violence
AveV9L0v83A,780320,782240,uh all the other problems that's
AveV9L0v83A,782240,784720,happening in our system it's literally a
AveV9L0v83A,784720,787920,powder keg folks we're living it's like
AveV9L0v83A,787920,790240,we're sitting on top of a powder keg and
AveV9L0v83A,790240,792079,you've got about 50 different things
AveV9L0v83A,792079,793680,sitting there lighting matches right
AveV9L0v83A,793680,796160,next to it at some point
AveV9L0v83A,796160,798000,you just got to think that at some point
AveV9L0v83A,798000,800480,it seems to be inevitable that one of
AveV9L0v83A,800480,802720,those matches are gonna light that keg
AveV9L0v83A,802720,805600,off uh so so do what you can now by
AveV9L0v83A,805600,808160,stocking up uh by getting your gardens
AveV9L0v83A,808160,808800,as
AveV9L0v83A,808800,810959,strong and as solid as you can many of
AveV9L0v83A,810959,813360,you live in areas uh that you're able to
AveV9L0v83A,813360,816160,plant a second crops of things uh and
AveV9L0v83A,816160,818639,for instance here we're probably about
AveV9L0v83A,818639,821199,30 days away from from really getting
AveV9L0v83A,821199,823760,serious about our second garden
AveV9L0v83A,823760,825920,and so if you're in areas that you can
AveV9L0v83A,825920,828399,do that be planning for that there's a
AveV9L0v83A,828399,830320,lot of crops that do better when you
AveV9L0v83A,830320,832079,plant them towards the end of the summer
AveV9L0v83A,832079,834079,and then they harvest them in the fall
AveV9L0v83A,834079,836480,so so do your research on that make sure
AveV9L0v83A,836480,838560,you're producing as much as you can
AveV9L0v83A,838560,841040,preserving all that you're producing
AveV9L0v83A,841040,843120,don't let it go to waste make sure you
AveV9L0v83A,843120,844399,you're figured out how you're going to
AveV9L0v83A,844399,845839,produce it where you're canning it
AveV9L0v83A,845839,848320,freezing it drying it you know cold
AveV9L0v83A,848320,850959,story whatever it is
AveV9L0v83A,850959,852079,because
AveV9L0v83A,852079,853680,come next year you're really going to
AveV9L0v83A,853680,855839,appreciate it because i have a feeling
AveV9L0v83A,855839,858160,that there's going to be a lot of items
AveV9L0v83A,858160,860240,that's going to be nearly impossible to
AveV9L0v83A,860240,861600,afford
AveV9L0v83A,861600,863519,unless you're just some of the the upper
AveV9L0v83A,863519,866560,wealthy folks get your houses in order
AveV9L0v83A,866560,868399,prepare yourselves mentally physically
AveV9L0v83A,868399,870720,and spiritually thank you for watching
AveV9L0v83A,870720,874240,i'll catch you in the next video
