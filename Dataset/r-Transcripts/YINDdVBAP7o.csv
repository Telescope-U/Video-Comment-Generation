YINDdVBAP7o,399,3360,ladies and gentlemen food scarcity
YINDdVBAP7o,3360,5160,globally is
YINDdVBAP7o,5160,8400,exploding at a rate that we haven't seen
YINDdVBAP7o,8400,9200,in
YINDdVBAP7o,9200,11679,decades and no i'm not just talking
YINDdVBAP7o,11679,14480,about developing nations anymore
YINDdVBAP7o,14480,16400,although i will talk about that shortly
YINDdVBAP7o,16400,18320,in the video where we don't just have
YINDdVBAP7o,18320,20880,three or four food emergencies now we
YINDdVBAP7o,20880,22720,have more than a dozen
YINDdVBAP7o,22720,26160,food emergencies around the world not
YINDdVBAP7o,26160,28960,only that in western nations where
YINDdVBAP7o,28960,30800,typically we've always been fairly
YINDdVBAP7o,30800,32880,stable with food
YINDdVBAP7o,32880,34800,there are a lot of warnings coming out
YINDdVBAP7o,34800,36640,now not just from the government but
YINDdVBAP7o,36640,39040,also other organizations the united
YINDdVBAP7o,39040,42079,nations the world bank as well the ceo
YINDdVBAP7o,42079,44879,the the head guy should we say at the
YINDdVBAP7o,44879,47840,world bank has just done an interview
YINDdVBAP7o,47840,50640,talking about this crisis that is on the
YINDdVBAP7o,50640,52879,way with food i've been doing my own
YINDdVBAP7o,52879,55120,research over the last few days i've
YINDdVBAP7o,55120,57680,been tracking all sorts of things from
YINDdVBAP7o,57680,60480,inflation through to food banks through
YINDdVBAP7o,60480,64000,to food scarcity in western developed
YINDdVBAP7o,64000,65600,nations by
YINDdVBAP7o,65600,69760,income group by age group by state by
YINDdVBAP7o,69760,73200,country and it is very very alarming i'm
YINDdVBAP7o,73200,74720,going to show you a couple of these
YINDdVBAP7o,74720,76640,things today then so we'll just jump
YINDdVBAP7o,76640,78960,straight into it on the shared screen we
YINDdVBAP7o,78960,80560,now want to welcome david malpass
YINDdVBAP7o,80560,82320,president of the world bank welcome back
YINDdVBAP7o,82320,84479,to face the nation thank you very much
YINDdVBAP7o,84479,87280,there's also shortages there's inflation
YINDdVBAP7o,87280,89520,and and the food shortages for the
YINDdVBAP7o,89520,91360,poorer countries are becoming a
YINDdVBAP7o,91360,94240,significant concern they already are but
YINDdVBAP7o,94240,97040,you're also describing a recipe for
YINDdVBAP7o,97040,99280,global instability when there's not
YINDdVBAP7o,99280,101759,enough food that uh for for
YINDdVBAP7o,101759,103759,weaker countries poorer countries that
YINDdVBAP7o,103759,106560,that causes uh instability and it's a
YINDdVBAP7o,106560,108240,big factor in the turnover of
YINDdVBAP7o,108240,110720,governments food crisis will be at least
YINDdVBAP7o,110720,113040,a three-year problem the three-year
YINDdVBAP7o,113040,114799,problem
YINDdVBAP7o,114799,117040,what time horizon do you put on the food
YINDdVBAP7o,117040,119680,crisis and the energy crisis the
YINDdVBAP7o,119680,121360,fertilizer isn't being made you know
YINDdVBAP7o,121360,124159,fertilizer comes a giant source of
YINDdVBAP7o,124159,126960,fertilizer is from natural gas
YINDdVBAP7o,126960,128959,through the ammonium channel and that's
YINDdVBAP7o,128959,131280,just not happening so a lot of the world
YINDdVBAP7o,131280,133760,is shutting down for lack of fertilizer
YINDdVBAP7o,133760,136000,and then those shortages of crops will
YINDdVBAP7o,136000,139120,last for multiple years are we at crisis
YINDdVBAP7o,139120,141360,we're at crisis and we see more
YINDdVBAP7o,141360,144080,countries falling in one by one okay so
YINDdVBAP7o,144080,146400,there you have it right there this is
YINDdVBAP7o,146400,149040,the head of the world bank this is no
YINDdVBAP7o,149040,151599,longer um you know conspiracy or
YINDdVBAP7o,151599,153519,anything like that this this is these
YINDdVBAP7o,153519,155840,people politicians leaders
YINDdVBAP7o,155840,159599,talking about this on main stream media
YINDdVBAP7o,159599,161920,channels they are telling you now they
YINDdVBAP7o,161920,163519,are warning you and they're warning
YINDdVBAP7o,163519,166560,everybody else that we are going to have
YINDdVBAP7o,166560,169599,food shortages now let's head over to
YINDdVBAP7o,169599,173040,the united states census bureau then and
YINDdVBAP7o,173040,176080,this is pretty alarming these are the
YINDdVBAP7o,176080,179440,states that have food insecurity or food
YINDdVBAP7o,179440,182480,scarcity at the moment and you can see
YINDdVBAP7o,182480,184560,this dark green area
YINDdVBAP7o,184560,187280,is growing and growing and growing and
YINDdVBAP7o,187280,189040,it's not just the states that you would
YINDdVBAP7o,189040,190879,typically assume
YINDdVBAP7o,190879,193360,now we're seeing even california we're
YINDdVBAP7o,193360,196720,seeing texas we're seeing a lot of other
YINDdVBAP7o,196720,199760,more wealthy states where there is food
YINDdVBAP7o,199760,201840,scarcity if you want to look any of this
YINDdVBAP7o,201840,203120,data up
YINDdVBAP7o,203120,206159,just head over to the census.gov
YINDdVBAP7o,206159,209040,and you can see all of this it is pretty
YINDdVBAP7o,209040,211519,concerning now what does all of this
YINDdVBAP7o,211519,214159,mean inflation means longer lines at
YINDdVBAP7o,214159,216720,food banks americans are turned into
YINDdVBAP7o,216720,219120,food banks for help in the face of
YINDdVBAP7o,219120,220400,rising
YINDdVBAP7o,220400,223599,food crisis some 55 of the 200 food
YINDdVBAP7o,223599,226159,banks in the feeding america network say
YINDdVBAP7o,226159,229440,donations of food are down at the same
YINDdVBAP7o,229440,232239,time pandemic relief programs including
YINDdVBAP7o,232239,234239,a river of government purchase food for
YINDdVBAP7o,234239,236480,distribution to the poor are winding
YINDdVBAP7o,236480,239439,down too i'm going to talk also about
YINDdVBAP7o,239439,241200,the uk and then we're going to look at
YINDdVBAP7o,241200,243519,all the global issues here as well but
YINDdVBAP7o,243519,245680,let's just get into this first because
YINDdVBAP7o,245680,247920,it all ties together congress should
YINDdVBAP7o,247920,250720,increase mandatory annual funding for
YINDdVBAP7o,250720,253280,the emergency food assistance program
YINDdVBAP7o,253280,257519,tfap to 450 million dollars and earmark
YINDdVBAP7o,257519,260560,200 million a year for distribution cost
YINDdVBAP7o,260560,262960,now of course there is push back on all
YINDdVBAP7o,262960,266160,this additional emergency funding etc
YINDdVBAP7o,266160,268800,but here's what i find uh ironic i guess
YINDdVBAP7o,268800,270240,we can say
YINDdVBAP7o,270240,272479,countries like the us and the uk and a
YINDdVBAP7o,272479,275360,lot of other wealthy nations they can
YINDdVBAP7o,275360,277600,find billions
YINDdVBAP7o,277600,280400,billions of dollars or pounds or euros
YINDdVBAP7o,280400,282560,is what it's going to be for things like
YINDdVBAP7o,282560,285199,bombs and bullets to send to you know
YINDdVBAP7o,285199,287840,ukraine and the like and other war they
YINDdVBAP7o,287840,290080,can spend billions on war in fact
YINDdVBAP7o,290080,292160,trillions when you look at afghanistan
YINDdVBAP7o,292160,294560,iraq and some of the others but yet they
YINDdVBAP7o,294560,296960,can't find a hundred million or 200
YINDdVBAP7o,296960,299919,million for a food program for their
YINDdVBAP7o,299919,301120,citizens
YINDdVBAP7o,301120,302880,that tells you that something is very
YINDdVBAP7o,302880,305600,very wrong in this world when we now
YINDdVBAP7o,305600,307840,operate at this sort of level this
YINDdVBAP7o,307840,311280,article is out of ohio in the u.s then
YINDdVBAP7o,311280,313919,fewer food donations are coming in
YINDdVBAP7o,313919,316080,because food is more expensive and the
YINDdVBAP7o,316080,318400,cost to purchase food to distribute is
YINDdVBAP7o,318400,320560,spiking as well so you've got a double
YINDdVBAP7o,320560,322800,hit here you have the cost of food going
YINDdVBAP7o,322800,326160,up and you have gasoline diesel other
YINDdVBAP7o,326160,328240,fuels for vehicles going up
YINDdVBAP7o,328240,330080,last year the food bank spent around 2
YINDdVBAP7o,330080,334080,million on food to supplement donations
YINDdVBAP7o,334080,336080,they expect to spend at least double
YINDdVBAP7o,336080,338560,that this year just to keep up so you
YINDdVBAP7o,338560,341600,can see double that cost in ohio the
YINDdVBAP7o,341600,343520,state association of food banks is
YINDdVBAP7o,343520,346560,asking the governor for 183 million
YINDdVBAP7o,346560,350000,dollars in american rescue plan act
YINDdVBAP7o,350000,351919,funds to help hedge against the
YINDdVBAP7o,351919,354160,financial pressures food banks are
YINDdVBAP7o,354160,356319,facing all we can tell them is that
YINDdVBAP7o,356319,358240,we're doing everything we can but it's a
YINDdVBAP7o,358240,360240,heartbreaking situation when we know
YINDdVBAP7o,360240,364000,families are going hungry over to the uk
YINDdVBAP7o,364000,367120,then i pulled this data off the trussell
YINDdVBAP7o,367120,369360,trust this is a trust that i actually
YINDdVBAP7o,369360,372240,support and i would say to all of you
YINDdVBAP7o,372240,374240,really if you are in a fortunate
YINDdVBAP7o,374240,377280,position and you do have excess food or
YINDdVBAP7o,377280,379919,you have a large pantry that you rotate
YINDdVBAP7o,379919,380960,a lot
YINDdVBAP7o,380960,382479,and you do have some food that may be
YINDdVBAP7o,382479,384479,coming up to expire in the next few
YINDdVBAP7o,384479,387199,months um and you can spare food or you
YINDdVBAP7o,387199,389360,can spare funds i would definitely
YINDdVBAP7o,389360,391759,recommend helping out some of these food
YINDdVBAP7o,391759,394000,banks if it is within your budget
YINDdVBAP7o,394000,396080,because i can tell you how this is going
YINDdVBAP7o,396080,399199,to go this is only going to get worse
YINDdVBAP7o,399199,401360,and the governments although they have
YINDdVBAP7o,401360,403919,got all of this money for war and and
YINDdVBAP7o,403919,406479,other measures should we say when it
YINDdVBAP7o,406479,408319,comes to food historically when you look
YINDdVBAP7o,408319,411039,at the data and you look at history they
YINDdVBAP7o,411039,413120,don't often put in the money that is
YINDdVBAP7o,413120,416240,required to help to feed the hungry so
YINDdVBAP7o,416240,418479,that's why i mean personally i can't
YINDdVBAP7o,418479,420400,speak for you or what you should do but
YINDdVBAP7o,420400,422639,with any excess money that i have i
YINDdVBAP7o,422639,425199,definitely help out food banks so this
YINDdVBAP7o,425199,427840,is the trussel trust then in the united
YINDdVBAP7o,427840,430880,kingdom and you can see this it shows
YINDdVBAP7o,430880,433759,the number of emergency food parcels
YINDdVBAP7o,433759,435680,given by food banks in the trussel
YINDdVBAP7o,435680,440400,network between 21 and 22 and it is huge
YINDdVBAP7o,440400,442560,i mean the numbers that were given out
YINDdVBAP7o,442560,444160,and you can see this sort of spike here
YINDdVBAP7o,444160,446880,if we get in a little closer uh compared
YINDdVBAP7o,446880,449039,to this time five years ago the need for
YINDdVBAP7o,449039,451039,food banks in our network has increased
YINDdVBAP7o,451039,453759,by 81
YINDdVBAP7o,453759,455759,i mean that is huge you can see how this
YINDdVBAP7o,455759,458240,was climbing even before we went into
YINDdVBAP7o,458240,460400,lockdowns over the last sort of year and
YINDdVBAP7o,460400,462080,a half two years
YINDdVBAP7o,462080,464240,and this is what happened during that
YINDdVBAP7o,464240,468479,period of 2020 to 21 this exploded so
YINDdVBAP7o,468479,471520,food bank usage exploded but you would
YINDdVBAP7o,471520,473440,expect with all the stimulus and all the
YINDdVBAP7o,473440,475520,money that's been produced that this
YINDdVBAP7o,475520,477199,would have come down
YINDdVBAP7o,477199,480639,past the the sort of this 1.9 million
YINDdVBAP7o,480639,484319,number here but no it's still sat at 2.1
YINDdVBAP7o,484319,486479,million so all you have to do you don't
YINDdVBAP7o,486479,488240,need all the data just look at the
YINDdVBAP7o,488240,490400,number when it comes to the food banks
YINDdVBAP7o,490400,492639,and that tells you how the economy is
YINDdVBAP7o,492639,495160,doing now up to
YINDdVBAP7o,495160,498639,811 million people go to bed hungry
YINDdVBAP7o,498639,500319,every night the number of those facing
YINDdVBAP7o,500319,503840,acute food insecurity has more than
YINDdVBAP7o,503840,506800,doubled a total of 50 million people are
YINDdVBAP7o,506800,510400,facing emergency levels of hunger in 45
YINDdVBAP7o,510400,512399,countries in just two years the number
YINDdVBAP7o,512399,514640,of severely food insecure people has
YINDdVBAP7o,514640,517839,increased by more than 200 million from
YINDdVBAP7o,517839,520800,135mg
YINDdVBAP7o,520800,524640,so this is up to now 345
YINDdVBAP7o,524640,528000,million people across 82 countries this
YINDdVBAP7o,528000,530959,is huge and what else are we seeing we
YINDdVBAP7o,530959,533920,saw sri lanka we're also seeing ecuador
YINDdVBAP7o,533920,536560,now rising up a lot of other developing
YINDdVBAP7o,536560,539120,nations and what's happening in
YINDdVBAP7o,539120,541920,venezuela
YINDdVBAP7o,542640,545440,but this is how it ends up we won't
YINDdVBAP7o,545440,547279,watch the whole video here but this is
YINDdVBAP7o,547279,549040,what actually happens
YINDdVBAP7o,549040,551839,you get groups of starving people that
YINDdVBAP7o,551839,554000,just go on the rampage and they'll get
YINDdVBAP7o,554000,556959,whatever food they can that was a cow
YINDdVBAP7o,556959,558720,they were chasing there and
YINDdVBAP7o,558720,560320,you can probably guess how the video
YINDdVBAP7o,560320,563279,ends other news that we've just had out
YINDdVBAP7o,563279,565920,china northeastern black soil grain
YINDdVBAP7o,565920,568000,field is alarmingly
YINDdVBAP7o,568000,570399,depleted this is on top of their their
YINDdVBAP7o,570399,572880,failed harvest over the last year or two
YINDdVBAP7o,572880,575040,so it's not looking good out of china
YINDdVBAP7o,575040,576959,either what else do we have we have
YINDdVBAP7o,576959,580080,ukraine is not looking good russia not
YINDdVBAP7o,580080,582160,exporting the way it was
YINDdVBAP7o,582160,584720,bbc news here food bills are set to soar
YINDdVBAP7o,584720,587040,by 380
YINDdVBAP7o,587040,589360,pounds this year
YINDdVBAP7o,589360,592000,the cost of living crisis people cut
YINDdVBAP7o,592000,595519,back on food shopping as price rises
YINDdVBAP7o,595519,598399,bite nearly half of adults surveyed by
YINDdVBAP7o,598399,600399,the ons which is the office for national
YINDdVBAP7o,600399,602640,statistics of the united kingdom
YINDdVBAP7o,602640,604320,said they had bought less food in the
YINDdVBAP7o,604320,608000,past fortnight due to higher prices now
YINDdVBAP7o,608000,610000,i thought this was quite interesting how
YINDdVBAP7o,610000,612640,all these supermarkets keep saying that
YINDdVBAP7o,612640,614560,now let me read this out to you
YINDdVBAP7o,614560,616880,some shoppers are asking cashiers to
YINDdVBAP7o,616880,619760,stop scanning items when the till total
YINDdVBAP7o,619760,622800,hits 30 pounds as they try to cut costs
YINDdVBAP7o,622800,625440,and also switching to budget ranges that
YINDdVBAP7o,625440,627760,seems a strange number to me that all of
YINDdVBAP7o,627760,629680,these shoppers are coming in and saying
YINDdVBAP7o,629680,632240,oh when you get to 30 pounds just just
YINDdVBAP7o,632240,634640,stop what what what is this magic number
YINDdVBAP7o,634640,636720,30 pounds it just seems very strange
YINDdVBAP7o,636720,640480,like it seems like pre-programming to me
YINDdVBAP7o,640480,643519,also switching to budget ranges well
YINDdVBAP7o,643519,645360,here's the thing if people
YINDdVBAP7o,645360,647440,are only you know got 30 pounds as a
YINDdVBAP7o,647440,650079,budget anyway they were probably already
YINDdVBAP7o,650079,652480,using budget ranges so this just seems
YINDdVBAP7o,652480,654000,very strange because i keep seeing this
YINDdVBAP7o,654000,656240,paragraph in all sorts of different
YINDdVBAP7o,656240,659040,media not just from one supermarket but
YINDdVBAP7o,659040,660800,multiple supermarkets saying the same
YINDdVBAP7o,660800,662959,thing it seems to me like this is some
YINDdVBAP7o,662959,665120,sort of pre-programming here
YINDdVBAP7o,665120,667120,many customers are buying it down
YINDdVBAP7o,667120,669519,particularly with food choosing value
YINDdVBAP7o,669519,671920,range items where they might previously
YINDdVBAP7o,671920,674399,have bought premium goods rising costs
YINDdVBAP7o,674399,676160,of groceries then you can see over the
YINDdVBAP7o,676160,678560,last year this is quite a good sort of
YINDdVBAP7o,678560,681200,interactive chart here shows you all the

YINDdVBAP7o,836959,839199,like a broken record saying it but we're
YINDdVBAP7o,839199,841680,living in a broken system where as i
YINDdVBAP7o,841680,844160,said earlier we've got billions for
YINDdVBAP7o,844160,846079,bombs and bullets and and everything

YINDdVBAP7o,875440,878880,now moving into the monetary side so a
YINDdVBAP7o,878880,881440,monetary collapse and also the food
YINDdVBAP7o,881440,883440,aspect as well we're going to see a
YINDdVBAP7o,883440,886240,major issue with food as a result of
YINDdVBAP7o,886240,887680,fertilizer
YINDdVBAP7o,887680,890320,crop failures weather changes
YINDdVBAP7o,890320,892639,this is going to be severe it's not
