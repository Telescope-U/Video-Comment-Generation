8pL-DEjhatY,62399,67439,and a lot of food that's a lot of meat  and you've never seen food like this i
8pL-DEjhatY,67439,74320,don't know if this cow shaved its legs  mine didn't  i'm on a mission to witness some of the  most unique intense flavors you'll find

8pL-DEjhatY,98320,103360,the shona people who make up the largest  ethnic group in zimbabwe
8pL-DEjhatY,103360,111040,so what are they doing right now they  are celebrating the cow that's just  coming to the house it's a gift to my  mother meet gracia bavute a self-trained

8pL-DEjhatY,128319,133360,they are definitely oh wow that's a lot  of meat are there gonna be more people  coming today just uh the villagers
8pL-DEjhatY,133360,138400,around definitely will hear the singing  and the celebrations and they'll be  curious so they'll definitely come
8pL-DEjhatY,138400,143440,through and these meet so we're gonna  have a lot of people there
8pL-DEjhatY,143440,148879,this tradition is called moment literal  translation cow of motherhood it's the
8pL-DEjhatY,148879,154800,shona people's version of bride price  traditionally upon marriage the husband  would present a fertile cow to the
8pL-DEjhatY,154800,160080,wife's mother it's a payment to  compensate for the pain of the bride's  family when the husband takes her away
8pL-DEjhatY,160080,166560,to his village gracia's father had not  yet gifted the cow and now in the wake  of her passing it will be shared with
8pL-DEjhatY,166560,170120,the entire family
8pL-DEjhatY,173599,178720,all right so it's starting now  okay they just slip the throat and
8pL-DEjhatY,178720,185280,they're saving the blood are we gonna  eat them we're gonna enjoy it i know i  am are you yeah okay great
8pL-DEjhatY,185280,191360,they removed all the blood what are they  going to do with them they're going to  take out some of the fat from the cow  and they use that to substitute the oil
8pL-DEjhatY,191360,196879,that you'd normally use and they'll just  like fry it and it turns into like  ground beef
8pL-DEjhatY,196879,202720,after the cow is dispatched members of  the community begin butchering each  piece is dedicated to a certain member
8pL-DEjhatY,202720,209560,of the family some is given away but  much of it will be used for today's  feast
8pL-DEjhatY,219280,226239,anytime a cow is slaughtered and served  here a goat must go along with it as an  introductory offer
8pL-DEjhatY,226239,233760,from the goat a delicacy is prepared  fried goat's blood  they start by rendering goat fat in oil
8pL-DEjhatY,233760,240400,add the fresh goat blood and season with  salt  this could technically qualify for one
8pL-DEjhatY,240400,247120,of rachel ray's 30-minute meals you'll  know it's cooked when the blood becomes  dark and solid
8pL-DEjhatY,247200,252959,this is our introductory meal for the  day so this is goat blood goat fat and a  little bit of oil a little bit of salt
8pL-DEjhatY,252959,259759,yeah and you know i like that i  appreciate they didn't over spice it i  really want to taste the full flavor of  the blood
8pL-DEjhatY,261199,266960,so there's two parts to this there's  blood and then the fat do we eat the fat  or is that for flavor you eat the fat as
8pL-DEjhatY,266960,273440,well i think we start with the blood so  the blood is almost boiled down to like  a blood cake but let's have a cake in  more of a crumble no it looks like liver
8pL-DEjhatY,273440,278560,yeah it looks a little bit liberating so  i'm gonna grab a couple of pieces here  and just throw it back cheers
8pL-DEjhatY,278560,283680,okay good man tastes better than i  thought like a liver with like onions  right sometimes it tastes like liver
8pL-DEjhatY,283680,289919,because both the blood and the liver  have like the mineral taste and so i can  see why you would say that but i like  the texture of it it's like wisconsin
8pL-DEjhatY,289919,296880,cheese curds kind of a little bit  but here this is the fat and no one
8pL-DEjhatY,296880,302240,chops out a lot okay i'm just going to  try like yeah rip off a piece yeah
8pL-DEjhatY,302240,305600,all right  cheers
8pL-DEjhatY,307600,313280,i like the blood i don't like the fat  it's gummy and i keep chewing and  nothing's happening it's full of flavor
8pL-DEjhatY,313280,320639,though and i could see him i've been  drinking since 6am and i need some  flavor and some salt to go with all the  beer this would be great
8pL-DEjhatY,320639,326080,i want to ask you more about today and  why we're here today so um when i was  shown a culture when a female is married
8pL-DEjhatY,326080,332400,the husband is paying for the wife to  the wife's parents even today many  cultures around the world still practice
8pL-DEjhatY,332400,338320,bride price this doesn't indicate the  man is paying for the woman rather it's  a symbolic gesture acknowledging the
8pL-DEjhatY,338320,344160,husband's permanent debt to the bride's  parents one of the last things that you  should pay is the cow to thank the
8pL-DEjhatY,344160,349919,mother for taking care of your wife in  the shona culture the debt is paid in  the form of cattle so that cow might
8pL-DEjhatY,349919,357039,come through when the person is late  that's finishing off the payment for the  person because they're no longer there  today is the day that my father has to
8pL-DEjhatY,357039,362400,finish off the payment for his wife  we're just getting started there's a lot  more to come today from here they're  going to cook a lot of food it's going
8pL-DEjhatY,362400,368720,to be drinking eating and a lot of music  i can hear in the background so we're  gonna be trying a lot more food what's  your favorite part i think definitely
8pL-DEjhatY,368720,376080,the intestines and and the tribe okay  fantastic i'm now looking forward to  that too also
8pL-DEjhatY,376080,381840,while it's customary everywhere to  celebrate with food you may have noticed  here that alcohol has also made an
8pL-DEjhatY,381840,387280,appearance  my man how's it going good good this is  richie gracia's uncle what are you
8pL-DEjhatY,387280,393600,drinking i'm drinking beer hey that does  not look like any beer i've seen before  it's white this is a traditional shona
8pL-DEjhatY,393600,400080,beer called huahua it looks and tastes  nothing like beer that's because it's  usually made by fermenting corn or
8pL-DEjhatY,400080,405759,sorghum can i smell it  smelling nice oh it's so nice
8pL-DEjhatY,405759,411520,so there's a lot of people here and  there's a lot of work who is drinking  who is working
8pL-DEjhatY,411520,417680,this one is drinking and this one is  drinking this one is drinking and then  who does the work our waves how many
8pL-DEjhatY,417680,423039,wives do you have i've got one but one  is with my brother i put four
8pL-DEjhatY,425270,430319,[Music]  in this village traditional gender roles
8pL-DEjhatY,430319,435680,are embraced on this day in particular  women are in charge of the cooking and  the men are in charge of slaughtering
8pL-DEjhatY,435680,440800,and well drinking lots and lots of  drinking all right so the women cook we
8pL-DEjhatY,440800,445759,drink what we  well i would like to drink too
8pL-DEjhatY,446000,452000,cheers  very nice oh it's really delicious yeah
8pL-DEjhatY,452000,458160,it's really thick it's sour it's almost  like vinegar and alcohol mixed all right  thank you so much for letting me try
8pL-DEjhatY,458160,463199,that i feel a little buzzed but i'm  gonna drink some water i think i'll be  okay thank you
8pL-DEjhatY,463199,468319,preparations for the feast are underway  right now they're making something  called saza this is cornmeal mixed with
8pL-DEjhatY,468319,473360,water and they just have to mix the heck  out of it otherwise there's going to be  lumps and inconsistencies so they have
8pL-DEjhatY,473360,479520,to keep it all the same kind of texture  it is a real labor of love here you need  some serious lat strength to pull this
8pL-DEjhatY,479520,487439,off do you need help do you want to tap  out  oh he's good perfect  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,490800,497199,it's actually harder than it looks oh my  gosh i'm going to buy you guys an  industrial sized mixer this is a lot of
8pL-DEjhatY,497199,503680,hard work  the lactic build up is too much someone  come on
8pL-DEjhatY,503680,508960,all right finally we need someone with  fresh arms she's obviously a lot  stronger than me and she's got technique
8pL-DEjhatY,508960,515120,working in her favor  zaza is the main source of calories in  many sub-saharan countries it's usually
8pL-DEjhatY,515120,522800,made from a simple mixture of water and  corn flour but it can also be made with  millet cassava or sorghum
8pL-DEjhatY,524080,531200,oh this stick is so short  all right i'm trying to copy her  how do you know when it's finished
8pL-DEjhatY,531200,535839,it's finished  oh good timing
8pL-DEjhatY,536800,542320,party update this is one of the wildest  most interesting kind of impromptu  parties i've ever been to there is not
8pL-DEjhatY,542320,548160,exactly a sense of urgency but behind me  rain cloud soon at any moment the rain  is going gonna come pouring down and
8pL-DEjhatY,548160,553440,then i'm not sure what cause there's  people cooking outside so we're gonna  see what happens all i'm saying is it is
8pL-DEjhatY,553440,559120,3 16 p.m and they've cooked about five  percent of the cow so far good start  we've got some momentum i can say that
8pL-DEjhatY,559120,563839,we've got some momentum let's see where  this takes us
8pL-DEjhatY,564800,571360,communal events like this are a delicate  balance of work and play either you're  carefully laboriously preparing the food
8pL-DEjhatY,571360,576800,so others can eat or you're drinking  your face off
8pL-DEjhatY,576800,583040,so far the drinking is winning out while  i have serious doubt in this feast  coming to fruition on the events
8pL-DEjhatY,583040,588880,periphery you'll see pockets of men  cleverly grilling small bits of meat far  from the masses
8pL-DEjhatY,588880,594000,i've noticed so far it's not exactly  everybody working together to make a  feast that happens at one time some
8pL-DEjhatY,594000,600640,people are grabbing meat and they've  gone to the side they've gone to the  corner here to cook up their own food  away from everybody else so that's what
8pL-DEjhatY,600640,606000,this is here is this beef yeah it is the  stomach area of the cow and this is the  cow blood yeah this is a different
8pL-DEjhatY,606000,611040,preparation yeah they didn't put the oil  or the fat all right so i don't think  we're gonna try that because it's not
8pL-DEjhatY,611040,616800,quite done yet but could we try some of  this meat yeah this one hello sir could  you meet me
8pL-DEjhatY,616800,623160,oh thank you you know what you could  just bite it  there you go rip it off it's good right
8pL-DEjhatY,623160,628880,[Music]  it's salty  it tastes like someone was trying to  preserve it in case there was like
8pL-DEjhatY,628880,634320,another y2k but overall i like it i  think this one mixed perfectly with beer  which i think is what people are doing
8pL-DEjhatY,634320,639360,here yeah  my impression at least of today's event  is that it's not all building up to one
8pL-DEjhatY,639360,644800,big feast it seems like cooking needs to  be done but everyone just kind of wants  to drink and hang out and no one really
8pL-DEjhatY,644800,650160,wants to cook that's exactly what's  happening so we don't even know what  we're gonna walk away with today like we
8pL-DEjhatY,650160,656959,might eat something this might be it  yeah fantastic so this is good it's a  nice little snack but hopefully we build
8pL-DEjhatY,656959,663279,up into some kind of a meal or something  more we can try soon also your uncle do  you think i could do a dance contest  with him i think so i would want to see
8pL-DEjhatY,663279,669720,that all right let's make that is on him  all right let's do it
8pL-DEjhatY,674730,682429,[Music]  so  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,685480,693308,[Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,701970,708160,[Music]  [Applause]
8pL-DEjhatY,708160,714399,i cannot believe we haven't been rained  out yet i mean i've just been seeing  rain clouds everywhere but they're going  around us the food gods are with us
8pL-DEjhatY,714399,720480,today everything's coming together here  they're starting to serve people up so  we have the satsang i somewhat helped
8pL-DEjhatY,720480,726000,make that  it's looking pretty good to me guys what  do you think but here we have something
8pL-DEjhatY,726000,731360,i've never seen before is this also a  sad song it is  made from sorghum sorghum what is
8pL-DEjhatY,731360,737120,sorghum it feels like an ingredient you  would have on oregon trail it is  actually a grain that we also have here
8pL-DEjhatY,737120,743200,and it's a very small brown very tiny  seed does it taste different from the  corn sauce it's a very different and the
8pL-DEjhatY,743200,749920,thickness this one is more sticky than  the white saucer what if we tried some  right now i'll live life
8pL-DEjhatY,753360,760480,in one spontaneous moment this entire  festive crowd becomes silent this type  of reaction could only be elicited from
8pL-DEjhatY,760480,766160,one individual the village chief right  now the chief is making a speech for the  whole crowd here
8pL-DEjhatY,766160,773200,i have no idea what he's saying  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,773200,778880,what was that so apparently the chief  has been hearing that people have been  just asking for stuff so he was just
8pL-DEjhatY,778880,784480,saying when you're invited to an event  at least have the courtesy to respect  the people that are there and stop
8pL-DEjhatY,784480,790079,harassing people he just put an end to  that yeah he did with his word will that  stop yeah i think so i like this guy i
8pL-DEjhatY,790079,796560,like him too can we try some sansa  usually you would eat this with other  food right yeah you would i'm dying to
8pL-DEjhatY,796560,801760,try it right now just plain is that okay  yeah that's fine it's sticky so it's  like malto meal yeah it is my first
8pL-DEjhatY,801760,806800,sorghum bite i'm very excited i'm a bit  of a sorghum virgin let's go
8pL-DEjhatY,808000,813360,very fine and um not much flavor at all  it makes sense it's kind of a  carbohydrate and with that you mix in
8pL-DEjhatY,813360,821279,all the different meats than the other  food yeah and then the flavor really  kicks in of everything else so this is  just like um i mean the rice tastes
8pL-DEjhatY,821279,826320,it's incredible the rain is coming now  the food's almost done we've got sorghum
8pL-DEjhatY,826320,833279,we should go find a dry place to eat  probably all right let's do it  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,833279,839279,this is a beautiful scene like somehow  the food got done in time it's raining  we got people under a tent people under
8pL-DEjhatY,839279,845680,a tree everyone's just taking refuge  somewhere and eating and we're about to  do the same can you give me a little  tour of what's going on here obviously
8pL-DEjhatY,845680,851760,we've got the salsa and this is the tank  looks great  for this dish the cow's tongue is first
8pL-DEjhatY,851760,859120,removed from its head  it's doused with boiling hot water and  the outer skin is peeled away
8pL-DEjhatY,859120,866880,scrape off any hairs then chop it up and  boil  [Applause]  finish with diced onions and tomatoes
8pL-DEjhatY,866880,872480,well i think i have the literal tip of  the top  right here let's do it
8pL-DEjhatY,872480,878720,oh oh oh that is tough uh-huh i think it  needs to be boiled a little more i think  so this is so chewy yeah is it supposed
8pL-DEjhatY,878720,884720,to be that top i don't think so now i  think this is a little bit undercooked i  think what would make it a little easier  to eat is if it was cut into little
8pL-DEjhatY,884720,891600,pieces but i like the taste they haven't  put a ton of seasonings on it so you're  actually really tasting the true tongue  itself it's very beefy i like it
8pL-DEjhatY,891600,898160,let's talk about this what is going on  in here this is just the cow's feet the  feet oh and the legs too right yeah it's
8pL-DEjhatY,898160,903920,nice to see that nothing from this  animal has gone to waste including the  cow's feet
8pL-DEjhatY,903920,910160,they're chopped and boiled for hours  add oil to a pot and add the feet and
8pL-DEjhatY,910160,916560,looks like there's some ankles in there  too toss in some diced onions tomatoes  and a little bit of foot broth
8pL-DEjhatY,916560,922079,let me grab a piece right now oh yeah so  this is like a shin but it's become very  gelatinous all right let's try it out
8pL-DEjhatY,922079,927440,okay  wow  it's like tendon it's so rich and fatty
8pL-DEjhatY,927440,933279,and heavy i like it i like the inside  here i mean i don't even know what those  parts are it's just really gelatinous it
8pL-DEjhatY,933279,938959,reminds me of tendon and it actually  might be tender because in vietnam beef  noodles it has tendon in there like this
8pL-DEjhatY,938959,947360,and it's like my favorite part that is  so cool i think like people here would  absolutely love it because i think  that's the part they also really love
8pL-DEjhatY,947360,953199,now for the staple you'll find in most  every zimbabwean meal this sad song with  the saadza we can use that to soak up
8pL-DEjhatY,953199,960720,the soup yeah definitely show me the way  so people kind of like mold it into like  a little bowl and then after that you
8pL-DEjhatY,960720,967120,make a little dent in oh like a divot so  that you can actually scoop up some  stuff and then uh
8pL-DEjhatY,967120,973199,don't get it on your dress  um  all right here we go  oh it's tomatoing really rich not too
8pL-DEjhatY,973199,979440,salty or anything but the essence of the  cow is very powerful i like it  our final bite is something special and
8pL-DEjhatY,979440,984639,not for the faint of heart tripe or cow  stomach and intestines get a big pot and
8pL-DEjhatY,984639,991199,add oil then add the organs and pray  that whoever cleaned them is detail  oriented
8pL-DEjhatY,991199,997600,as the meat cooks and softens toss in  some diced onions and a generous pinch  of salt
8pL-DEjhatY,997600,1003040,let's end with the tribe grab a piece  that's a good piece that one looks like  a carpet this one looks like honeycomb
8pL-DEjhatY,1003040,1009440,in my culture we actually differentiate  these two we call these bibles like the  actual jesus christ bible yeah i know
8pL-DEjhatY,1009440,1015839,that one and these ones are just like  normal tribes so some people might not  even eat these and like these ones
8pL-DEjhatY,1015839,1021240,because they're more soft yeah well now  i feel like i should be eating that
8pL-DEjhatY,1023710,1030558,[Music]  how you doing it's the same every time i

8pL-DEjhatY,1085280,1091679,combinations you've never seen before  what's wrong the realization  to a meat lover's dream a drive-in
8pL-DEjhatY,1091679,1096880,barbecue on an absolutely massive scale  how do you even get out of here without  getting into a car accident you have to
8pL-DEjhatY,1096880,1103089,try today's food fun well that all  starts  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1105390,1112480,[Music]  here shopping center its founding goes  back to 1977 with francis zindoga with
8pL-DEjhatY,1112480,1119360,his butchery and bottle storm now it  looks like this  one of the capitals major food hubs with
8pL-DEjhatY,1119360,1125760,tons to choose from  come drink eat drink more and hopefully
8pL-DEjhatY,1125760,1132080,take a cab home  yesterday ferrari local grassy  introduced me to her family outside the
8pL-DEjhatY,1132080,1137760,city and right now she's introducing me  to cheapo my name is sunny and this is  gracia
8pL-DEjhatY,1137760,1143679,cheapo is the manager of big man bry a  meaty street stall influenced by south  african barbecue right now you're
8pL-DEjhatY,1143679,1150320,preparing a dish this is called  gongo is a favorite in zimbabwe but this  is not a one-person plate of food we
8pL-DEjhatY,1150320,1156080,usually save in a tray and everyone digs  in from the same plate it's a platter of  protein meant to be shared with friends
8pL-DEjhatY,1156080,1161600,or family it's more like something that  brings us closer together communal food  reminds me of korean barbecue a little
8pL-DEjhatY,1161600,1167360,bit the foundation of the recipe is an  incomprehensible mix of meat
8pL-DEjhatY,1167840,1174160,ox kidney and beef are added to a wok  with water and salt  on the side chicken gizzards that are
8pL-DEjhatY,1174160,1179280,cleaned chopped and added in is this  going to be a stool or what will this be  basically we don't want it to be as chew
8pL-DEjhatY,1179280,1185200,the main reason behind it is that we get  to fry all these and then add our  vegetables and then our chilies then
8pL-DEjhatY,1185200,1190640,chicken neck feet and thigh  add more water and allow it to cook down
8pL-DEjhatY,1190640,1196559,a bit it seems like a lot of street food  here is meat yeah mainly the meat  because this area it specializes in
8pL-DEjhatY,1196559,1203200,gochugauchi or bry which is just  basically barbecue and meat our parade  of protein continues heart pork belly
8pL-DEjhatY,1203200,1209600,spicy pork sausage then a bit of cooking  oil and diced onions and tomatoes
8pL-DEjhatY,1209679,1215750,finally the green well cheapo can tell  you what it's called we call them rape  are you saying the word rape
8pL-DEjhatY,1215750,1221679,[Music]  how do you say it  it's a rape city that's how they call it
8pL-DEjhatY,1221679,1226799,r-a-p-e  yeah there's no way around that hit it  with a bit of spice and dig in with six
8pL-DEjhatY,1226799,1232640,of your closest friends  [Music]  all right we have our meal right here  this looks even better than i thought it
8pL-DEjhatY,1232640,1238480,would oh we're eating with our hands  aren't we yeah definitely no one brought  forks there's forks in here right these  are the forks i think we should start
8pL-DEjhatY,1238480,1243760,with pork belly just covered with rape  all right let's try it out
8pL-DEjhatY,1244559,1250880,the r word is definitely like a spinach  or something where there's still some  texture to it while you're eating it  it's not just dissolved away i see there
8pL-DEjhatY,1250880,1256080,are hearts  it tastes really good it almost tastes  buttery salty and then some nice spice
8pL-DEjhatY,1256080,1262559,coming from the chilies i think this is  the ox kidney over here  this tastes like liver they both have
8pL-DEjhatY,1262559,1267600,that minerality right because it  filtering uh you know all your stuff and  turning it into peeps why are you saying
8pL-DEjhatY,1267600,1273760,pee when i'm eating it city oh um not  pin  sausage
8pL-DEjhatY,1273760,1279360,well seasoned it's got a kick of  spiciness in it as well i think i've got  a geez in here
8pL-DEjhatY,1279360,1284640,oh super chewy delicious i love that  it's such a random hodgepodge of  different ingredients but when they cook
8pL-DEjhatY,1284640,1291600,it all together it works perfectly okay  saad's up this just doesn't have a lot  of flavor so you have to kind of add  flavor to it by putting in the meat and
8pL-DEjhatY,1291600,1297760,the veggies so you do that little spoon  thing again way ahead of you oh i see  you're learning singing
8pL-DEjhatY,1297760,1302480,what is that are you schmingle  cheers
8pL-DEjhatY,1302799,1308960,it tastes like chicken heart with a base  of mashed potatoes that have no salt or  butter inside now chicken feet everyone  around the world has a different way of
8pL-DEjhatY,1308960,1314720,eating it let me see your way  okay you try to strip it away but  sometimes the toes will rip off okay no
8pL-DEjhatY,1314720,1320240,they didn't oh you know what's gnarly  about this this is my first time eating  chicken feet with the toenails they're
8pL-DEjhatY,1320240,1327200,still on there let me try it  it hasn't been cooked that long so the  meat's still kind of hard
8pL-DEjhatY,1327200,1333840,so you have to really work to get it off  but once you do it's nice and chewy like  some kind of calamari sunny
8pL-DEjhatY,1334480,1341120,i wanted to ask you more about harare  did you grow up here yeah i did born and  raised in harare why do you think  zimbabwe isn't more known globally we
8pL-DEjhatY,1341120,1346480,have a lot of beautiful places in  zibabras apart from victoria falls that  everybody else knows we have inyanga
8pL-DEjhatY,1346480,1351840,montopoulosi hills where you actually  get like scenic views that are so  beautiful but i feel like there hasn't
8pL-DEjhatY,1351840,1358000,been enough of coverage on what our  country has to offer another problem  that we might be having is people of our
8pL-DEjhatY,1358000,1364480,generation we don't speak a lot of  positive about our country if we learn  to embrace our culture more definitely
8pL-DEjhatY,1364480,1371120,people will end up knowing about  zimbabwe and falling in love with it and  people wanting to come and see what  zimbabwe has to offer i got to say i've
8pL-DEjhatY,1371120,1379519,just been here a day and a half but i'm  loving it so far great so with that  being said this is a great start we have  a lot more street food to eat let's go
8pL-DEjhatY,1382159,1388640,well ashley how are you doing this is  your place yes it's fantastic just 30  steps away tucked inside a small alley
8pL-DEjhatY,1388640,1394559,miss ashley is preparing another  zimbabwean staple one i've never seen  before right here in the first pot this
8pL-DEjhatY,1394559,1400240,is rice but it's not any kind of rice  it's a brown rice and it's turned brown  because it's been mixed with peanut
8pL-DEjhatY,1400240,1406000,butter something i've never had before  but i love peanut butter next the beef  bones so these are big thick chunks of
8pL-DEjhatY,1406000,1411760,cow femur the bones are boiled in a big  pot for at least two hours or until  people start asking for that toss in
8pL-DEjhatY,1411760,1419200,some salt and tomatoes and boil it a bit  more is this rape yes it's also a peanut  butter yes oh that's great ashley yes
8pL-DEjhatY,1419200,1425919,thank you so much  i'm dying to try this i love peanut  butter
8pL-DEjhatY,1426320,1431600,i like it it's not a super strong peanut  taste it lacks the sweetness that our  peanut butter has because uh in the us
8pL-DEjhatY,1431600,1436799,we like to put sugar in peanut butter no  everything it's interesting because the  rice has been cooked so much that it's
8pL-DEjhatY,1436799,1444120,become kind of a mash with just a hint  of peanut flavor on top of that and it  seems like it'd go well with these two
8pL-DEjhatY,1444400,1449679,i really like that vegetable so it's hot  steaming juicy and then i would say  between cabbage and spinach but now with
8pL-DEjhatY,1449679,1454720,a hint of peanut flavor in there too is  that something local to this country  they're one of the dishes that you get
8pL-DEjhatY,1454720,1461360,at traditional functions like  traditional weddings even if grandmother  comes from the village you're probably  gonna get some peanut butter vegetables
8pL-DEjhatY,1461360,1467039,this is cowboy it's all just like this  meat you're supposed to kind of gnaw off  um wow yeah this does take some effort
8pL-DEjhatY,1467039,1473279,okay so here is a nice piece of protein  you got some there too yeah let's go for  it  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1473279,1479039,it's a bit chewy but still juicy and it  tastes like a beef roast or just kind of  like stewed beef but that is in the
8pL-DEjhatY,1479039,1484960,middle of cooking that's just a pure  piece of fat  it's a bit rich but actually it's very
8pL-DEjhatY,1484960,1490639,flavorful ashley you're crushing it how  do you say delicious in the local  languages
8pL-DEjhatY,1492799,1499700,the way you're saying it is i taste good  i taste delicious this also pretty good
8pL-DEjhatY,1499700,1503409,[Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1506240,1511919,whenever lunchtime hits this place  becomes a hive of activity vendors  prepare for the midday rush with stacks
8pL-DEjhatY,1511919,1517120,of grilled and fried chicken ready to  send out at a moment's notice
8pL-DEjhatY,1517279,1522799,as people gather in crowds form a couple  of entertainers come to capitalize on  the moment the crowd's welcoming
8pL-DEjhatY,1522799,1528320,response is a sign they've seen this  type of show before and they're looking  forward to more so right behind me is
8pL-DEjhatY,1528320,1535279,zimbabwean entertainment the best you're  going to get they come here they have a  whole list of tricks and things that  they do
8pL-DEjhatY,1535279,1542640,and they work for chips if new york has  buskers singing for cash then harare has  these guys stand up
8pL-DEjhatY,1542640,1548400,slapstick  [Applause]
8pL-DEjhatY,1548400,1553679,and some impressive yet slightly  revolting strange human tricks oh my god  that's a condom
8pL-DEjhatY,1553679,1559940,oh  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1566559,1574080,if that didn't make you lose your  appetite well let me tell you about our  next food  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1574080,1579440,my man how are you doing i'm good how  are we doing i'm with the pit master  he's manhandling this meat right here
8pL-DEjhatY,1579440,1584480,this whole place is famous for its  chicken we've got chicken that's cooked  we got chicken in little pieces this
8pL-DEjhatY,1584480,1590480,chicken stall pre-marinates their meat  with madras curry powder and mixed  chicken spices oh it's so hard how do
8pL-DEjhatY,1590480,1595840,you do it you're not crying or anything  i've been crying the whole day but for  personal reasons not related to the
8pL-DEjhatY,1595840,1601919,smoke lightly grill cut it into smaller  pieces and toss it in hot oil so it's  just like a shallow fry there's not even
8pL-DEjhatY,1601919,1608000,a lot of oil the only issue now is he's  got to stop the fire he's gonna get this  fire going the rest of the chicken is  going in the oil and we're gonna eat
8pL-DEjhatY,1608000,1614559,some fried chicken soon i can't wait can  you wait  she said yes
8pL-DEjhatY,1614559,1621600,she said yes  [Music]  this place is wild yes it is so what is
8pL-DEjhatY,1621600,1627760,the name of this place this is another  area from the place that we just come  from and here they do more of barbecue
8pL-DEjhatY,1627760,1633600,on a larger scale so you've got more  options to choose from and definitely  it's mainly chicken over here fried
8pL-DEjhatY,1633600,1639520,chicken it's not usually grilled and  then fried but here it is yes it is this  is what we call fried chicken here in
8pL-DEjhatY,1639520,1644000,sabah should we try it out yes i got  skin here
8pL-DEjhatY,1645360,1651200,that's good oily fatty skin here's some  of the drumstick  well it's super heavy i like it though
8pL-DEjhatY,1651200,1657440,it's simple it's straightforward it's  just salt really but it's interesting to  see a little different style and as  always it's served with the sadzak do
8pL-DEjhatY,1657440,1662880,people feel like a meal is incomplete  without satsang certainly i think so  when they do charge you for this meal
8pL-DEjhatY,1662880,1668399,usually they don't charge for the satay  what they're charging you for is for the  meats and salt is sort of like
8pL-DEjhatY,1668399,1674720,complimentary so if you were to say i  don't want the salsa you're still gonna  pay the same amount  so you'd rather just you know half the
8pL-DEjhatY,1674720,1680799,sakura anyway we have one more location  we're gonna go somewhere that even blows  this place out of the water yes what's  it called
8pL-DEjhatY,1680799,1688520,it is one of the most talked about  places in zimbabwe and i'm so excited to  take you there
8pL-DEjhatY,1699279,1705360,this place is crazy all right i told you  sunny it was going to be amazing miraki  is by far one of harares and this
8pL-DEjhatY,1705360,1711039,country's most popular open-air  entertainment joints yes i had yama  choma when i was in kenya but i've never
8pL-DEjhatY,1711039,1718320,seen anything like this  the crowds the cars it's like a tailgate
8pL-DEjhatY,1718320,1725760,party that never goes to the game a rock  concert where the main star is the meat  that's delivered to your cause
8pL-DEjhatY,1725760,1731840,in all 300 people work to make this  operation move from butchers to runners  and pit masters they even have an ice
8pL-DEjhatY,1731840,1738000,cream guy oh he's turning around no no i  mean oh
8pL-DEjhatY,1738000,1743440,oh dang it i got testicles in my hands  what you got my man all right just one  how much is it

8pL-DEjhatY,1750320,1755760,we have two cones now yeah more about  that in a second i see people running  around with meat taking orders are those
8pL-DEjhatY,1755760,1762080,like servers yes every person that owns  a stole essentially has somebody that  runs around to deliver the food so you
8pL-DEjhatY,1762080,1767679,can just pretty much just go order but  your food will come to your car this is  zimbabwe's version of a drive-in eatery
8pL-DEjhatY,1767679,1773919,where the hood of your car becomes your  dining table heck you could never leave  your front seat if you didn't want to
8pL-DEjhatY,1773919,1781080,when a runner takes your order they'll  head to the butcher then to whichever  pit master they work for
8pL-DEjhatY,1781120,1787200,once the meat is ready it's yours pair  that with a crate of beers and try not  to sideswipe too many cars on your way
8pL-DEjhatY,1787200,1792399,out  if you're not ready to eat big you could  always start with an appetizer this
8pL-DEjhatY,1792399,1797840,testicles yes or what they call them  here gearboxes a gearbox yeah what does
8pL-DEjhatY,1797840,1804320,that mean  i don't know the testicles or as gracia  likes to call them gearboxes they're
8pL-DEjhatY,1804320,1810240,sliced into smaller bite-sized pieces  seasoned with salt and spices then  placed on a gas price stand until they
8pL-DEjhatY,1810240,1815809,cook through  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1817840,1823039,it's got a texture almost like chicken  heart it's dense but soft and the  seasoning on there is delicious it's
8pL-DEjhatY,1823039,1828320,salt but there's something else on there  too is it usually men eating these yeah  there's just this thing that goes around
8pL-DEjhatY,1828320,1833919,that if you're a woman and you do happen  to eat them you might not conceive but i  don't believe it you might not conceive
8pL-DEjhatY,1833919,1839440,am i supposed to love things that won't  give me children this much  because i do and then you just chase
8pL-DEjhatY,1839440,1845200,that with some ice cream  i'm in heaven amazing good start i'm  gonna head over to the meat section
8pL-DEjhatY,1845200,1850399,there's this long corridor of nothing  but grills with smoke billowing out i  want to see how they're grilling all
8pL-DEjhatY,1850399,1856480,this food  [Music]  all right i really want to show you the  scale of this place because it's wild
8pL-DEjhatY,1856480,1862960,there are hundreds of people here  hundreds of cars and along here dozens  of people cooking meat the scale
8pL-DEjhatY,1862960,1868000,is ridiculous and the amount of meat  coming through here too so when people  order they can order from here if they
8pL-DEjhatY,1868000,1873279,want to but most people are ordering  from their car because they can stay at  their car and they can drink at their
8pL-DEjhatY,1873279,1878880,car because that's what you want to do  right here they have so much going on in  here huge troughs wood burning grapes on
8pL-DEjhatY,1878880,1884880,top and then tons of different types of  meat on our menu today local zimbabwe  and beef steak and a beef blend sausage
8pL-DEjhatY,1884880,1891200,is that steak yeah and then what's this  beef sausage oh after ordering from a  runner our meat is grilled with a touch
8pL-DEjhatY,1891200,1896480,of salt and delivered to someone's  tailgate where they said we could film  if we brought the car owner some booze
8pL-DEjhatY,1896480,1902559,deal  hello step one wash your hands because  we're eating with our hands all right i
8pL-DEjhatY,1902559,1907679,like that everything comes to you here  it does we've got our food here i think  we should do steak first so here they
8pL-DEjhatY,1907679,1913600,provided us with a knife oh my gosh hot  off the grill we're out here the weather  is beautiful there's music there's smoke
8pL-DEjhatY,1913600,1919519,everyone's having a blast let's try it  out  best thing we've had today absolutely
8pL-DEjhatY,1919519,1925360,really good juicy salty  pretty tender oh and you know what the  best part you can really taste the
8pL-DEjhatY,1925360,1932080,charcoal it's so smoky and delicious so  how they have this yam they grab a piece  of meat they get a tomato cucumber and a
8pL-DEjhatY,1932080,1937039,little piece of onion sure i'll do it  but i'm not going to do cucumber
8pL-DEjhatY,1937600,1942799,it's fresh it's got some acid i just  need to wash it down with this  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,1942799,1948799,how do we um i'm going to show you a  trick don't be surprised sunny  oh

8pL-DEjhatY,1956159,1962320,beer and i love that no matter where you  go in the world you can find some kind  of lager that tastes basically like bud  light now i want to ask you this they've
8pL-DEjhatY,1962320,1967600,just cooked our meat well the default is  well done well done for everyone and  i've noticed that all over africa why is
8pL-DEjhatY,1967600,1972640,that so i think people have just been  used to eating well cooked meat just to
8pL-DEjhatY,1972640,1979039,be safe because i know even sushi here  is that even a thing it is you've got a  couple of places that offer it but  there's so many people that are big on
8pL-DEjhatY,1979039,1984559,oh i'm not gonna eat that it's raw fish  that's disgusting i'll die that is a  mentality that is just like within

8pL-DEjhatY,2061040,2067200,later today this is where she gathers  ingredients this place is wild it's full  of energy tons of people and it's just
8pL-DEjhatY,2067200,2073358,sprawling it goes on forever people are  selling everything you can imagine food  other stuff i'm mainly focused on the
8pL-DEjhatY,2073358,2079760,food  embarre musica market it's a place where  people are meant to buy food and take it
8pL-DEjhatY,2079760,2085118,away  but wherever you find large groups  gathering you'll find food including
8pL-DEjhatY,2085118,2091200,this illegal street food kitchen it's  not supposed to be here no it's not  because of healthy hazards you have to
8pL-DEjhatY,2091200,2097040,get a license because of hygiene because  of hygiene with no permit and no clear  way to get one the owner here risks it
8pL-DEjhatY,2097040,2103200,all in an attempt to feed local workers  and make a humble living on today's menu  grilled chicken and zaza a
8pL-DEjhatY,2103200,2110800,straightforward favorite but if you ask  nicely they might show you this cow lung  and cow esophagus i did not know you
8pL-DEjhatY,2110800,2117200,could eat that here we love it it's nice  for the vitamins and all the cow's cow  parts have been boiled down with onion
8pL-DEjhatY,2117200,2123200,tomatoes and a bit of salt i've learned  that this is the classic trifecta used  for cooking pretty much any protein in
8pL-DEjhatY,2123200,2130720,zimbabwe  pair with rice and pumpkin leaves that  are deceivingly delicious show me how to
8pL-DEjhatY,2130720,2137519,eat it okay  a little bit of rice then you dig in  all right
8pL-DEjhatY,2137920,2143040,that's ridiculous  that's super delicious almost sweet and  buttery it's hard to compare it to
8pL-DEjhatY,2143040,2149280,another plant do they cook that with  butter they just use water wow  wow that's stupid good no one's gonna
8pL-DEjhatY,2149280,2155200,believe me but it almost has a sweetness  of like crab legs that is outstanding  i'm delaying the inevitable we need to
8pL-DEjhatY,2155200,2162160,try these lungs and a big chunk of it  let's go for it  oh yeah very tasty super tasty and soft
8pL-DEjhatY,2162160,2167839,the flavors are not that strong it  tastes like salt tomato onion everything  here we cook with natural we don't do
8pL-DEjhatY,2167839,2174160,spices all right that was good no  actually that was great but now this is  something that's blowing my mind the  esophagus you will eat this whole thing
8pL-DEjhatY,2174160,2176799,yes i can
8pL-DEjhatY,2179520,2188320,try the chocolate oh like the ring yeah  the top ring  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,2188320,2193920,well  i'm not sure i'd say if it's tender same  delicious flavors what would you compare  that to that's like if you're eating
8pL-DEjhatY,2193920,2199280,chicken wings and you get that really  bristly tendon part that's connected to  the bone but it's all made of that i
8pL-DEjhatY,2199280,2204160,think it was very nice you need some  powerful teeth to get through that
8pL-DEjhatY,2206560,2211680,mbari musica is located in the middle of  harare city a fading radiant of vendors
8pL-DEjhatY,2211680,2218000,and residential buildings on the market  edges  make it impossible to measure if you  walk from one side to the other how long
8pL-DEjhatY,2218000,2224720,does that take an hour in an hour that's  real thing that's bigger than squad a  walmart  i was told somewhere here they have
8pL-DEjhatY,2224720,2231119,insects yes they do  here they have some insects i've never  even heard of never even seen before i
8pL-DEjhatY,2231119,2236320,didn't know people were collecting them  or eating them so i'm hoping to track  those down and if i find something
8pL-DEjhatY,2236320,2242359,could you cook it up yeah i will try and  cook it you'll try it that's all i ask
8pL-DEjhatY,2244320,2250079,it's the busiest market in zimbabwe and  quite possibly in all of africa as you  walk through the market i mean there's
8pL-DEjhatY,2250079,2257119,no way to just show this place through  individual stationary shots you have to  feel it in 3d
8pL-DEjhatY,2257119,2262240,everywhere you look there's a different  food someone carrying something on their  head pulling a cart it's so lively
8pL-DEjhatY,2262240,2268079,there's so much action i love it mangoes  nice over 17 000 people come here to do
8pL-DEjhatY,2268079,2273520,business every day boom this is where  everything begins everything that gets  here it either comes in big trucks or
8pL-DEjhatY,2273520,2279520,people from local villages are bringing  it too so there's people at all levels  all scales just kind of rocking up  throwing down their fruit and doing
8pL-DEjhatY,2279520,2286000,their best to sell it before they head  home it's a distribution center for  fresh fruit and vegetables that'll make  their way to the rest of the city and
8pL-DEjhatY,2286000,2291680,surrounding areas behind me there's a  literal mountain of corn and there's  also 10 people looking at me wondering
8pL-DEjhatY,2291680,2296880,what the hell i'm saying everyone here  speaks english by the way they're just  like  it's corn what's the big deal somebody
8pL-DEjhatY,2296880,2302880,has dropped all this off they're going  through it and people who want to buy  the coin they go through they inspect it  they check it they buy it they take it
8pL-DEjhatY,2302880,2308160,home or to their restaurant how you  doing  see people are super friendly they
8pL-DEjhatY,2308160,2314320,actually are just not that guy  just a five minute walk from where i had  breakfast another rogue food stall here
8pL-DEjhatY,2314320,2321280,they're serving up different chicken  bits including the salty deep-fried  intestines  an excellent snack or drinking food i
8pL-DEjhatY,2321280,2326720,break them salty super crunchy it's  almost like a chicken jerky not bad a  little bit of an appetizer a little bit
8pL-DEjhatY,2326720,2332880,of an hors d'oeuvre if you will it's  interesting i think because of hygiene i  think because of a lack of  infrastructure it's not really supposed
8pL-DEjhatY,2332880,2338839,to be a food place but it's kind of  unavoidable where people gather there  will be food here they're serving
8pL-DEjhatY,2338839,2345280,intestines before leaving the market  crunchy  i must see their selection of bugs yes
8pL-DEjhatY,2345280,2352320,they have mopane worms but i tried those  before in namibia how does it taste  it tastes like a gluten-free food i'm
8pL-DEjhatY,2352320,2357680,looking for something i can only find  here we are deep in the market right now  i've come to your stall this is your
8pL-DEjhatY,2357680,2363440,area yes where does it start and where  does it end that's from here to here  uh-oh so i'm in someone else's property
8pL-DEjhatY,2363440,2368560,right now hi it's my professor oh this  is your tube yes caroline stahl  specializes in
8pL-DEjhatY,2368560,2374960,pretty much anything she's interested in  selling today that includes big-headed  ants i've had a lot of ants before i've
8pL-DEjhatY,2374960,2382000,never seen ants like this a variation of  the fire ant and an invasive species  they have kind of an average sized body
8pL-DEjhatY,2382000,2388160,and a huge head they're a soil master  and can be found during the dry season  there's two kinds here this is this is
8pL-DEjhatY,2388160,2393440,termites yes  that's wild termites belong to the  cockroach family they also come from the
8pL-DEjhatY,2393440,2398480,ground anytime you see these giant wet  brown mounds like this well that is a
8pL-DEjhatY,2398480,2405119,termite mansion  i've heard of them i've never seen that  well because i live in the north in  minnesota we have winter so we don't
8pL-DEjhatY,2405119,2410960,really have termites and here they are  millions of them in my hands  it prepared incorrectly input sorts
8pL-DEjhatY,2410960,2416160,termites can be poisonous this is  something i wish i'd known before  tossing them in my mouth
8pL-DEjhatY,2416160,2421200,[Music]  it's pretty good
8pL-DEjhatY,2421200,2426319,that is different than any other insect  i've had it's a very distinct flavor i'm  glad i tried this it's nutty it has kind
8pL-DEjhatY,2426319,2432880,of a musky flavor even a little like a  a woody flavor  caroline i would love to buy some of
8pL-DEjhatY,2432880,2439520,these ants i'm going to take it to a  restaurant i'm going to see if they can  cook it up  now with ants in hand i'm heading to
8pL-DEjhatY,2439520,2445280,aretha's restaurant to see what she can  do with this unique ingredient this is  fantastic i'm so happy to be here thank
8pL-DEjhatY,2445280,2450720,you how long have you been doing this  i've been doing this for the past two  years  whenever she's not cooking at her home
8pL-DEjhatY,2450720,2457280,restaurant she's catering events or  parties today we've invited the whole  neighborhood for whatever comes next but
8pL-DEjhatY,2457280,2463359,first  the ants she prepares them two different  ways the snack version fried in hot oil
8pL-DEjhatY,2463359,2469680,with a dash of  salt and the meal version where the ants  are boiled then paired with peanut
8pL-DEjhatY,2469680,2476000,butter and cooked down into a sticky  paste what is your specialty my  specialty is oxtail really that's what
8pL-DEjhatY,2476000,2483040,we have right here this tail has been  stewing for three hours with you guessed  it tomato onion and a bit of salt
8pL-DEjhatY,2483040,2489680,like most foods in zimbabwe this goes  well with saadza a mixture of corn flour  and water before we get started i need
8pL-DEjhatY,2489680,2496400,to ask  what the hell is this  that's our african cucumber my least  favorite food is a cucumber and this
8pL-DEjhatY,2496400,2502000,looks like the grenade version of a  cucumber it looks like very aggressive  hostile angry at its parents people here
8pL-DEjhatY,2502000,2508400,call it it's like a covey disease oh  spike  when you cut this open does it look like  a normal cucumber yes he does all right
8pL-DEjhatY,2508400,2514079,i'm gonna have to cut this open later  mainly to kill it because i don't like  cucumbers i'm gonna try the plain ants  here mix it with salsa
8pL-DEjhatY,2514079,2520400,oh  can you hear the crunchiness there's  super crunchy this is a big head wow  that's quite a flavor pretty different
8pL-DEjhatY,2520400,2526880,than any other ant i've had it's hard to  pinpoint it i'm trying to figure out if  i like it or not super crunchy salty and  then it just has its own little funk to
8pL-DEjhatY,2526880,2533119,it here it's been mixed with peanut  butter  oh it's a nice big bite let's go oh
8pL-DEjhatY,2533119,2538240,yeah smart the peanut butter it takes  the edge off the ants it makes it a  little bit more smooth anything like
8pL-DEjhatY,2538240,2544720,peanut butter is awesome i could mix  lupus with peanut butter and it would  taste good this is your specialty the  oxtail optional is one of my most
8pL-DEjhatY,2544720,2550480,favorite things that i can't get  anywhere a lot of countries don't have  it it's also a food that just takes a  lot of love and time these beautiful
8pL-DEjhatY,2550480,2556720,cross sections of tail the bones in the  middle of course all the meat protein  tissue fat is all around it i like it
8pL-DEjhatY,2556720,2562240,like this  oh you just bite it right off the bone  yeah i'm getting my hands dirty for no  reason  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,2562240,2568319,oh  that's undeniable  as you go up and down the tail you have
8pL-DEjhatY,2568319,2575119,different amounts of fat and protein so  every bite's a little different  and they're boiling like the fat has  really rendered down i just peel the
8pL-DEjhatY,2575119,2580560,protein off the bone you can see it's  like a continuation of the vertebrae  here going down in the tail and that
8pL-DEjhatY,2580560,2587280,muscle just gets so tender and delicious  you stole my heart thank you
8pL-DEjhatY,2587280,2592880,today i'm making mazzondo mazzure is the  carpet then we have the cow head so what
8pL-DEjhatY,2592880,2599359,do you do with the cowage we cut it up  then we boil it we use an egg to cut it  an ax an egg
8pL-DEjhatY,2599359,2606079,i've got to see that  a big feast is coming up we've got some  ingredients from the market and then  some surprise ingredients i have no idea
8pL-DEjhatY,2606079,2611920,about  i have some idea about i saw it a little  bit today we're cooking up this whole
8pL-DEjhatY,2611920,2618800,cow head i have no idea how it's gonna  be done  oh my god i don't even know if we can  show that on on youtube is that a boy or
8pL-DEjhatY,2618800,2626000,a girl is it a boy how do you know do  you have a name tag  oh because of the horns beef is common
8pL-DEjhatY,2626000,2632640,and loved in zimbabwe and here they use  every part head to tail back to crack  step one remove the tongue which is just
8pL-DEjhatY,2632640,2638720,hanging off so we're going to save that  for later the tongue comes right off  so the goal here is to kind of char the
8pL-DEjhatY,2638720,2644160,skin this is a very delicate process you  don't want to burn the skin or overdo  the skin or even tear it away you want
8pL-DEjhatY,2644160,2651040,to heat it up just enough so all the  hair comes off the skin is still intact  so that can still be eaten later  gentlemen good luck i can hardly see
8pL-DEjhatY,2651040,2659409,good luck  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,2659839,2664960,here's the deal this head's about to get  chopped into little pieces so we can get  put in a pot and boil for a long time do
8pL-DEjhatY,2664960,2670160,we have a chef knife no  we have an axe
8pL-DEjhatY,2670480,2677839,hold up hey hold up why are you backing  up you don't think i have control of an  axe  huh today's special cuts include the
8pL-DEjhatY,2677839,2683200,entire head the tongue and the cow feet  now with the head hacked into several
8pL-DEjhatY,2683200,2689839,unspecified chunks  it's time to cook boil it in water with  a pinch of salt for four hours until the
8pL-DEjhatY,2689839,2695520,fat renders down and it becomes juicy  next the tongue is charred to remove its
8pL-DEjhatY,2695520,2700720,outer skin  then fill it open and spread out giving  it more surface area to soak up more
8pL-DEjhatY,2700720,2706640,salt and to cook faster  grill until it's cooked all the way  through the head meat and the tongue are
8pL-DEjhatY,2706640,2712400,paired with brown sauce made from  sorghum this is our final meal of the  day everything today has built up to
8pL-DEjhatY,2712400,2717520,this moment we started at africa's  busiest market where a lot of the  produce for this restaurant is source
8pL-DEjhatY,2717520,2722960,plus we have a cow head i'm not sure  where the cow head is from and i didn't  want to ask and i felt like when i saw  the head it was
8pL-DEjhatY,2722960,2728880,too late to ask the cow right now people  have dished up some food everybody's  eating
8pL-DEjhatY,2728960,2734800,this is kind of a familiar sight at this  place it's like a home restaurant so  there's a lot to try let's get into it  oh this is a tongue right here tongue is
8pL-DEjhatY,2734800,2742880,tough because tongue can be well really  tough if you don't prepare it properly  so this took about 20 minutes to grill  that whole thing all the way through
8pL-DEjhatY,2743119,2748800,success oh it's delicious super clean  taste really dense i mean tongue meat is  very underrated i would say tongue meat
8pL-DEjhatY,2748800,2754000,has a density kind of like heart meat  that's good goodness you see they've cut  it and scored it they could cook all the
8pL-DEjhatY,2754000,2760400,faster here this is a brown saza it  looks like chocolate malto meal does it  taste like that
8pL-DEjhatY,2760400,2765680,no it has next to no flavor a little bit  different texture than the normal sauce  i made from corn but of course that's
8pL-DEjhatY,2765680,2772560,meant to be paired with the other items  on the dish because all this meat is  very heavy for most people but not for  me here head this looks fantastic
8pL-DEjhatY,2772560,2779040,actually this is reminding me right now  of the tail we already have all the  beautiful fats and tissues that have  rendered down they're just sticky and
8pL-DEjhatY,2779040,2784079,slowly coming apart  all right there's pros and cons one
8pL-DEjhatY,2784079,2790160,delicious the fat is just melt in your  mouth the meat pulls apart it's super  tender it's made with time and love and
8pL-DEjhatY,2790160,2796560,a little hostility  the cons there are little bone fragments  in there you have to chew with caution
8pL-DEjhatY,2796560,2801760,because you might catch a little bit of  a bone splinter  delicious this is really outstanding i  can't believe it one of the most
8pL-DEjhatY,2801760,2807280,satisfying things i've eaten in a long  time oh look at this what is this it's  pineapple and cucumber i've been brought
8pL-DEjhatY,2807280,2812880,a salad to go with all these heavy foods  but here they have a type of cucumber  i've never seen before when you cut it  open it looks completely different from
8pL-DEjhatY,2812880,2818720,any cucumber i've seen before i don't  like normal cucumbers but i like sea  cucumbers
8pL-DEjhatY,2818720,2824720,oh super crunchy it's a little slimy  it's a little bit like the green part of  a watermelon but i guess that's what  cucumber tastes like here we have our
8pL-DEjhatY,2824720,2832160,last food first the cow feet hit the  flames to get charred scrape down then  cut into smaller pieces all this will
8pL-DEjhatY,2832160,2840229,soon be soup  all it takes is salt water heat and a  lot of time  [Applause]
8pL-DEjhatY,2840880,2848800,so this would be up on the ankle or a  little bit higher up on the leg it's  just pure tendon i'm going to just pull  this off take a look at that
8pL-DEjhatY,2848880,2854400,tendon super delicious when it gets  cooked down like this soft get a little  bit chewy but it's so rich you can only  have a little bit of that all right that
8pL-DEjhatY,2854400,2859599,is the foot right here is half of a hoof  and then the other half would be here  except they actually cut it down the
8pL-DEjhatY,2859599,2865200,center when they're preparing it and  what's really bizarre about the hoof is  there's an enamel on the outside the  enamel is basically like a big
8pL-DEjhatY,2865200,2870640,fingernail it's made out of keratin  underneath that there's meat and mussel  i'm literally gonna eat the bottom of a
8pL-DEjhatY,2870640,2875920,cow's foot let's try it out  oh that's awesome it's not too  dissimilar from the tendon almost like
8pL-DEjhatY,2875920,2881440,snappy crunchy when you bite into it  okay this is a little higher on the hoof  wow that's just pure skin bones and then

8pL-DEjhatY,2981839,2987839,separate structures most of which you  might be used to seeing under the same  roof this entire compound was hand built
8pL-DEjhatY,2987839,2993520,by vincent and his wife what are these  two buildings right here this is a  button that is a toilet one for cleaning
8pL-DEjhatY,2993520,2999280,one is for bathroom yes  [Music]  there's the main house where vincent and
8pL-DEjhatY,2999280,3004640,his wife sleep  each of the kids have their own  structure the kitchen gets its own
8pL-DEjhatY,3004640,3011680,structure too so on the side you have  kind of your dish rack your counter and  then the house itself what is it made  out of is it just mud this cozy compact
8pL-DEjhatY,3011680,3017200,kitchen was built in a month and a half  the women are tasked with building the  wood frame and filling it with mud they
8pL-DEjhatY,3017200,3023440,make with stones or bricks but this one  is stones while the men build the  rooftops these are the things for the
8pL-DEjhatY,3023440,3029440,millet then we put the glass on top and  here while vincent gives me a private  tour his wife noni starts breakfast
8pL-DEjhatY,3029440,3036800,starting with porridge  porridge starts with tamarind soaked in  hot water to extract its flavors
8pL-DEjhatY,3036800,3042640,tamarind is one of the many indigenous  fruit trees here that's worked its way  into several local dishes and then
8pL-DEjhatY,3042640,3048559,there's this african medicine i use it  to demand when they are not destroyed to  that site
8pL-DEjhatY,3048559,3053839,and he's got some boner medicine over  here all right oh you got lots of kids  can i buy some of this from you later
8pL-DEjhatY,3053839,3061200,back in the kitchen where things are  also getting steamy the tamarind infused  liquid is separated from the fruit
8pL-DEjhatY,3061920,3069760,she adds cornmeal to a pot with a touch  of sugar as she stirs it forms a thick  porridge cornmeal which will become zaza
8pL-DEjhatY,3069760,3075520,is the chief source of carbohydrate for  zimbabweans when you're miles and miles  from the closest city your cornmeal
8pL-DEjhatY,3075520,3082400,stash is like a chest of gold that's  where we keep maize or soda millet when  we cut from the farm is the idea like
8pL-DEjhatY,3082400,3088240,you don't want the animals to get to it  yes the cow can come in pasting having  the elephant this time we have got
8pL-DEjhatY,3088240,3094960,elephants are you telling me sometimes  elephants steal your food yes whoa this  is a problem i've never had in my life

8pL-DEjhatY,3100160,3106640,fill the pot with that mixture and cover  it with a plate  she adds coal on top to create mankind's
8pL-DEjhatY,3106640,3111920,first convection oven  in the meantime this is a cage for my
8pL-DEjhatY,3111920,3118800,hands you eat the eggs or try to get  more chicks i eat eggs from august  september october november because it's
8pL-DEjhatY,3118800,3124559,too hot so they don't make babies but  this now i leave them to make babies in  those other months when you eat the eggs
8pL-DEjhatY,3124559,3131440,there would be no babies anyways yeah  well thank you for the tour next we're  gonna finish breakfast and eat breakfast
8pL-DEjhatY,3135839,3141359,is this a usual breakfast for you yes  my mother cooks bread and porridge
8pL-DEjhatY,3141359,3147599,myself i cook fish can we try this first  the porridge  [Music]  i like it so i've had a lot of sausage
8pL-DEjhatY,3147599,3152720,so far it's a bit more starchy you can  grab it like mashed potatoes this is a  little bit more sticky but i like it
8pL-DEjhatY,3152720,3158640,more than sansa and i know i don't have  to compare i know they're different  things different purposes but has zero  flavor and this has flavor it's just a
8pL-DEjhatY,3158640,3166400,little bit sour and a little bit of  sweetness too oh that's great over here  you have the bread oh this looks really  good it's like super dense thick bread
8pL-DEjhatY,3166400,3172400,i like that it tastes like some kind of  a whole grain bread it's dense and kind  of doughy yeah i'm fascinated by your  lifestyle here you're out here you have
8pL-DEjhatY,3172400,3178720,your privacy you've built all your own  structures i mean you're really like  self-sustaining type of guy do you have  electricity here nothing so you don't
8pL-DEjhatY,3178720,3185200,even need it  oh whoops  this small solar panel that powers  vincent's brick phone are the only signs
8pL-DEjhatY,3185200,3188558,of modern technology here
8pL-DEjhatY,3190559,3196240,aside from tech meat is also rare to  come by except for fish
8pL-DEjhatY,3196240,3201920,fish find its way into many of the meals  around here including today's breakfast
8pL-DEjhatY,3201920,3207200,tilapia fillet rolled in flour lightly  fried  then dipped in egg
8pL-DEjhatY,3207200,3210078,and fried some more
8pL-DEjhatY,3212480,3217680,oh that's really good it's salty crunchy  on the outside flaky and light on the  inside it kind of reminds me of walleye
8pL-DEjhatY,3217680,3223760,or some kind of fresh fish we might eat  in minnesota where i'm from where do you  get the oil from you buy it from the  stove
8pL-DEjhatY,3223760,3229920,buy from the store  he's like what a dumb question even as  resourceful as vincent and his wife are
8pL-DEjhatY,3229920,3236400,there are still a few essentials worth  the long walk to the nearest market  cooking oil sugar salt and soap how do
8pL-DEjhatY,3236400,3242640,you make money well what is work for you  fishing making eggs crafting you make  silverware out of wood yes or i guess
8pL-DEjhatY,3242640,3249119,woodware with over 45 years of fishing  experience and a large river nearby  fishing is the most profitable source of
8pL-DEjhatY,3249119,3256559,income for vincent  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3256559,3262559,all right so we've come to the deca  river it's moving pretty quick and the  levels are pretty high you said are  these good conditions for fishing yes
8pL-DEjhatY,3262559,3268559,every day the deca river welcomes dozens  of local fishermen some prefer to ride  the wave with a fishing rod in hand
8pL-DEjhatY,3268559,3275920,others like vincent trust their nets to  do the job what do you call this in  english it's a deepness but in tonga
8pL-DEjhatY,3275920,3282480,sounds a lot cooler  okay so that gets about four times the  size now i'll put the stick here so he
8pL-DEjhatY,3282480,3289280,has kind of a rubber band here that he's  going to use to really tightly secure  this to the wood can i hold this to  pretend to help that's okay all right
8pL-DEjhatY,3289280,3294960,this whole net did you make all this  yourself yes this is cool  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3294960,3300160,this is the biggest fishing net i've  ever seen in my life so he just takes it  he goes up and down the coast the fish
8pL-DEjhatY,3300160,3306720,might be hiding among the rocks so when  he puts that over them it might scare  them into the net he can pull up and  then pull out the fish that's it it's
8pL-DEjhatY,3306720,3315130,that simple  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3315599,3322559,oh we got one  yes  this is a barber fishing that's pretty  big can i put my finger in its mouth
8pL-DEjhatY,3322559,3329040,is it oh it doesn't bite nothing well  trained well done do you have like a  bucket or where do you put that exactly  i forget the bake you want to put it in
8pL-DEjhatY,3329040,3338160,my pocket no i'll find a bit oh okay i  was trying to help  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3338160,3343280,are you happy with the catch for the day  yes do you think it helped having me  there
8pL-DEjhatY,3343280,3349440,the fish are either sold at market or  dried and saved in vincent's pantry for  personal consumption
8pL-DEjhatY,3349440,3357520,to prepare for drying each fish is  scaled gutted and laid on a wood rack  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3357520,3364079,the rack is put over a fire for four  hours until all the moisture leaves the  fish for even longer storage set them in
8pL-DEjhatY,3364079,3369839,the sun for the rest of the day  to bring life back to these dried fish
8pL-DEjhatY,3369839,3375960,throw them in boiling water to rehydrate  then add some seasonings
8pL-DEjhatY,3377520,3383040,it actually looks quite fantastic can i  have this one yes  oh i think i can pull the bone out of it
8pL-DEjhatY,3383040,3389119,i don't throw it in there oh no my dog  can take it oh what a waste i'm sorry  it tastes good it has a different
8pL-DEjhatY,3389119,3395040,texture for sure it's very obvious that  it was dehydrated and rehydrated so it  has kind of a spongy texture a pretty
8pL-DEjhatY,3395040,3400240,different texture than what we have this  morning but it's still satisfying it's  oily what you got there this is my skill
8pL-DEjhatY,3400240,3406319,scale to measure your calories i'm  wearing fish if i get the 5kg is 10 us  so you're selling fish for about a
8pL-DEjhatY,3406319,3412799,dollar a pound yeah for you you're 58. i  mean you're obviously very healthy very  uh in shape than a lot of people i know
8pL-DEjhatY,3412799,3419559,but is there a retirement plan what do  you do at a certain point if you're 65  75
8pL-DEjhatY,3419839,3426640,my son should look after me and i will  be using my cows so that's what i'm  looking for to sell them to help myself
8pL-DEjhatY,3426640,3432720,in many parts of rural africa cows are a  measure of wealth the more you have the  wealthier you are they're like the stock
8pL-DEjhatY,3432720,3439119,market or should i say the livestock  market people invest in cows and cows  hold their value or their value goes up
8pL-DEjhatY,3439119,3444720,they can live a long time and they can  even give birth to new cows that's  called a dividend so if you're wondering
8pL-DEjhatY,3444720,3451200,why he eats so many fish while he has  plenty of plump cows roaming around  that's why but once a week vincent
8pL-DEjhatY,3451200,3457680,breaks his pescetarian ways and treats  himself to one of these  are the guinea fowl like the chickens
8pL-DEjhatY,3457680,3463119,they lay eggs and you get more they thin  foul they make more eggs than their  chicken how come you have more chickens
8pL-DEjhatY,3463119,3469359,than guinea power guinea fowls is a  problem to grown up by the rain seasons  the kids of kingfield they get dyed so
8pL-DEjhatY,3469359,3476480,we take the eggs from the gin files we  give the chicken then they make babies  the chickens have to take care of the  guinea power yes oh that's the thing
8pL-DEjhatY,3476480,3483440,right now you're gonna go catch one you  have a couple tools right here what do  you have this one is for calling them to  come in here with me and then i
8pL-DEjhatY,3483440,3489620,throw that on top yeah okay so you're  not just running around no no no no  with age comes wisdom
8pL-DEjhatY,3489620,3496799,[Laughter]  oh they don't suspect anything oh hey
8pL-DEjhatY,3496799,3501839,i'm cool i'm uncle sunny i went that way  here it comes here it comes they eat
8pL-DEjhatY,3501839,3507119,with caution every bite they take they  look up and make sure everything's okay  okay he makes his move he's got one
8pL-DEjhatY,3507119,3514960,chance at this it's looking up it's  suspicious but it's also hungry  yes yes it's too late for you
8pL-DEjhatY,3514960,3520640,good move that was awesome you know i  swear on this show i've had people that  made me chase chickens around why not
8pL-DEjhatY,3520640,3526720,just do this what was i doing  before eating the guinea fowl is
8pL-DEjhatY,3526720,3532640,slaughtered  soaked in hot water and de-feathered
8pL-DEjhatY,3532960,3540079,chop it into random pieces  roll it in flour and just like any good
8pL-DEjhatY,3540079,3546480,bird recipe  fry  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,3546480,3553040,let's try it out you've been working  your ass off all day let's go  oh that's nice nice yeah salty on the
8pL-DEjhatY,3553040,3560400,outside a little crunchy real oily what  is the main difference between the  guinea power and the chicken the guinea  pig is so hard not so soft like chicken
8pL-DEjhatY,3560400,3565839,you like the taste of guinea power or  the hen more i like it any kind of meat  okay me too
8pL-DEjhatY,3565839,3571200,you're right really different texture  than chicken but still a pretty like  sticky white meat oh it's delicious for  all the work that went into this you
8pL-DEjhatY,3571200,3576559,thought maybe there would be more people  here helping you your wife isn't here  right now can you tell me where she is
8pL-DEjhatY,3576559,3582240,she was selling some cow the car was  broken like its leg was broken yeah it's  impossible to fix right yes and so
8pL-DEjhatY,3582240,3590240,what's that mean for you  because i can never buy another  in zimbabwe a cow can cost over 300
8pL-DEjhatY,3590240,3595760,that could be over a year of fishing for  a local so you may wonder why would  folks invest in an animal that needs to
8pL-DEjhatY,3595760,3602880,be protected fed and watered why not  just save cash  zimbabwe has a history of rapid and
8pL-DEjhatY,3602880,3609280,extreme inflation at one point the  government printed so much money they  even had a 100 trillion dollar bill
8pL-DEjhatY,3609280,3616240,those who saved in cash lost everything  those who invested in cows were fine
8pL-DEjhatY,3616240,3623599,sorry for your loss i know it's brutal  thank you nonetheless for everything  you've done for us today here the  tilapia oh my gosh look at this beauty
8pL-DEjhatY,3623599,3628680,vincent's final course today steamed  tilapia

8pL-DEjhatY,3641520,3644880,and everything for the dogs
8pL-DEjhatY,3646559,3651839,oh wow it's very earthy like i can taste  the river the water you use for cooking  where do you get that well now we are
8pL-DEjhatY,3651839,3657040,using the water from getting that's  fascinating i don't think i've had  rainwater or at least food cooked with  rainwater before maybe that's what i'm
8pL-DEjhatY,3657040,3662559,tasting well it's good it's a super  steamed nice fatty skin very very soft  super soft and then you have the saza
8pL-DEjhatY,3662559,3668640,here and you can even dip that there's  kind of a fish juice here  i like your sides out the best so far i
8pL-DEjhatY,3668640,3674799,like it it's a little like uh lumpy not  too smooth  i know it's supposed to be smooth but  actually i like that okay

8pL-DEjhatY,3694559,3699680,oh these are so good i've been saving it  and i just knew today was the moment  we're going to share it and i'm going to
8pL-DEjhatY,3699680,3705200,see what you think i don't want to  corrupt you this could be an evil thing  i'm doing maybe you will love this so  much and you can never try it again if

8pL-DEjhatY,3729760,3737359,things from our homeland that are unique  to where we come from and this is just  one for me and i just thought it would  be uh fun for you to experience
8pL-DEjhatY,3738160,3743920,there's no doubt that vincent's life is  not without adversity but what's so  impressive is that to an outsider he
8pL-DEjhatY,3743920,3751359,makes this look easy  and just so you guys know we bought  vincent a new car
8pL-DEjhatY,3752079,3757380,what do you think you like it yeah  you're eating it
8pL-DEjhatY,3757380,3762269,[Laughter]
8pL-DEjhatY,3762720,3769280,our epic southern africa food tour  continues in the country of zimbabwe now  we finally concluded our cross-country
8pL-DEjhatY,3769280,3775039,road trip arriving at our final  destination victoria falls
8pL-DEjhatY,3775119,3781280,today i'm on a mission to go deep into  zimbabwe's local flavors and local  ingredients it looks like a nice pair of
8pL-DEjhatY,3781280,3786640,shoes yeah it's so soft ingredients you  won't find at your average  air-conditioned supermarket you like
8pL-DEjhatY,3786640,3791680,this right  this is a food porn  in the end our efforts will culminate in
8pL-DEjhatY,3791680,3798079,a one-of-a-kind pork platter look at  this christmas but before that we gotta  go shopping carl yeah have you been to
8pL-DEjhatY,3798079,3804319,this market before yeah a few times  we've reached the city of victoria falls
8pL-DEjhatY,3804319,3809760,here there's a whole economy revolving  around travelers who wish to take in one  of the seven natural wonders of the
8pL-DEjhatY,3809760,3815760,world  aside from tourist lodges and  restaurants you can still find local  markets like this when you bought the
8pL-DEjhatY,3815760,3821839,bus going out of town this is where you  collect a couple of your ingredients  before you hit the road this place has a  ton of different foods they've got kind
8pL-DEjhatY,3821839,3827119,of the typical stuff this one is that  just puffed corn that's probably the  most unhealthy thing you can get in here
8pL-DEjhatY,3827119,3832640,here they have food and produce you'll  find at most any market around the world  that's puffed corn with lots of sugar
8pL-DEjhatY,3832640,3839920,and coloring but the uncolored  unflavored one if you wave this in front  of the camera you're to make a lot of  zimbabweans crave but if you have a keen
8pL-DEjhatY,3839920,3845760,eye you'll find some rare food  delicacies few outsiders have seen  before what is this so like termites
8pL-DEjhatY,3845760,3851200,will make a mound oh i've seen that  [Music]  from a termite mound but it has
8pL-DEjhatY,3851200,3856799,nutrition it doesn't it's a termite it  is whoa yeah oh you just ate some of it  yeah yeah there are many different types
8pL-DEjhatY,3856799,3863119,of edible clay dirt and soil in zimbabwe  but this one in particular comes  exclusively from termite mounds women
8pL-DEjhatY,3863119,3869119,will have a craving for this like  literally my wife will buy two of these  in a month oh i gotta try some of this  the data is still out on whether
8pL-DEjhatY,3869119,3874880,consuming dirt is good for your health  but it is rich in minerals especially  iron but like with anything i suggest
8pL-DEjhatY,3874880,3881440,eating dirt in moderation i mean yeah  there's no hiding the fact that is fun  and what's in here iron yeah i am taste
8pL-DEjhatY,3881440,3887839,100 like i just picked up some dirt and  ate it there's no like hidden notes or  anything like that that's much to give  you context so we grew up when we're
8pL-DEjhatY,3887839,3892880,young we'd play a lot of games acting  like we cooking and you know that kind  of thing and we'd eat a lot of mud you
8pL-DEjhatY,3892880,3898160,know when you grow with it it's not a  foreign taste to you  fascinating i mean it has nutrients for
8pL-DEjhatY,3898160,3904240,the trees why not for us yeah absolutely  carl was born and raised in a nearby  village now he's an international
8pL-DEjhatY,3904240,3910000,comedian standard comedian entertainer  and a cook yes and chef  what's good about this market a lot of
8pL-DEjhatY,3910000,3915119,the stuff is grown in the local villages  and so do you know where it's actually  come from i have to talk to you about
8pL-DEjhatY,3915119,3920240,this this guy  this is something i've never seen before  at first glance it looks like a fruit or
8pL-DEjhatY,3920240,3925680,something that's been around too long it  looks moldy then you pick up and touch  it it's like suede or velvet but this is
8pL-DEjhatY,3925680,3930880,a fruit right yes from the baobab trees  while many people know of the baobao
8pL-DEjhatY,3930880,3936960,tree few may know that it has a special  fuzzy fruit oh she has a big rock  exactly or is that dirt is that food
8pL-DEjhatY,3936960,3943200,and once you crack it open you'll reveal  one of the most nutrient-dense foods in  the world oh that is full of stuff
8pL-DEjhatY,3943200,3948960,baobao fruit is the only fruit that  dries naturally on the branch rather  than dropping or spoiling oh so it looks
8pL-DEjhatY,3948960,3954319,kind of like chalky almost yeah  it's got like citrusy sour notes oh
8pL-DEjhatY,3954319,3959760,there's some seeds right this is wild  the texture of it is very chalky the  flavor is sweet and tart so i use this a
8pL-DEjhatY,3959760,3965839,lot to make cheesecake oh wow i use this  in porridge so i'm a diabetic when i put  this into my sadza it controls my blood
8pL-DEjhatY,3965839,3971599,sugar a lot and the seeds are now being  processed to make oils and lots of  different things as well will you cook  with this today we're going to make a
8pL-DEjhatY,3971599,3977839,cocktail for you with this cool  so my father was a comedian and my mom  taught home economics so i stole the
8pL-DEjhatY,3977839,3983599,genetic pool i had my disposal so you  got a little bit from each one yeah yeah  stand-up comedy i only do 15 minutes on
8pL-DEjhatY,3983599,3988640,stage and the rest of the time i'm out  in the streets eating street food in the  different countries i travel to this
8pL-DEjhatY,3988640,3994480,brings me to the last  thing now i do believe i've had this  before a couple years ago i was in
8pL-DEjhatY,3994480,4000160,namibia and they had more paneer worms  these ammo pony worms yeah  well panty worms come from the mopane
8pL-DEjhatY,4000160,4006160,tree they're long juicy and can be found  in many parts of southern africa
8pL-DEjhatY,4006160,4011520,these have been dried just a way of  preserving them interesting it smells  like a wet dog a little bit pretty much
8pL-DEjhatY,4011520,4018000,a lot of our bugs have the same smell  when you dried them this is amongst a  lot of the new people
8pL-DEjhatY,4019200,4024880,especially from a political perspective  so i spent most of my time in exile he  studied in the uk and he's traveled a
8pL-DEjhatY,4024880,4030559,lot now that experience has worked its  way into his comedy and his food what do  you like about this i've been trying to
8pL-DEjhatY,4030559,4037119,find alternative ways to use these  because we get a lot of foreigners that  come into the country that don't quite  like the idea of eating the worms right
8pL-DEjhatY,4037119,4044160,so what i do is i crush them and i use  them as seasoning how would you describe  this do you think this is maybe what  fermented soy is to japanese i think it
8pL-DEjhatY,4044160,4050480,goes in that range between like a soy to  a fish sauce for example in terms of its  use when you say it like that i'm eating
8pL-DEjhatY,4050480,4056079,it with a different frame of reference  right and i'm experiencing that so  you're cooking up a lot for us today  yeah we are what's in store just give us
8pL-DEjhatY,4056079,4062640,a teaser so what we have is a pig's head  right  and we're gonna just chuck everything at  it every grain
8pL-DEjhatY,4062640,4067680,every imaginable flavor  cooking for us is more about bringing
8pL-DEjhatY,4067680,4072720,people together to do something else as  opposed to the actual cooking so we let  the stuff cook away on its own sit for
8pL-DEjhatY,4072720,4079520,three hours just watch life happen i  can't wait do you have a pig head not  yet we have to go find one let's go get  it cool we're heading a bit outside the
8pL-DEjhatY,4079520,4085280,city to find some pig parts you rarely  see on the dinner table how are you i'm  okay
8pL-DEjhatY,4085280,4091119,gary here she's in more than one meat  business butcher shop on the inside then  grilling and selling cooked meats on the
8pL-DEjhatY,4091119,4096960,outside a lot of butcher shops i go to  they have the meat on full display here  it's kind of hidden away in these chests
8pL-DEjhatY,4096960,4102000,each of these contains some different  meat we don't know what's inside i want  to point out what i see here though cow
8pL-DEjhatY,4102000,4107679,legs feet a little bit of both i'm kind  of distracted right now oh you like this  right this is food so you you cook this
8pL-DEjhatY,4107679,4113359,up sometimes so yeah you're gonna get it  do people have to buy a pair or do they  try to keep it together like when people
8pL-DEjhatY,4113359,4119600,adopt two dogs i would have this that my  wife would have for one person yeah  so we're not going to get any cow legs
8pL-DEjhatY,4119600,4124640,today sorry they look great he's a big  fan what are you looking for so uh do we
8pL-DEjhatY,4124640,4130238,have pig's head  let's take a look her best-selling item  and a favorite in zimbabwe beef but i
8pL-DEjhatY,4130238,4136238,have yet to see any pork  oh  yep all right thank you is that what you
8pL-DEjhatY,4136238,4141920,were looking for this is insane it looks  magical how old do you think this pig is  here's what i'm worried about the size
8pL-DEjhatY,4141920,4148080,do you have one more yeah can you get in  [Music]  this is perfect this is what you wanted
8pL-DEjhatY,4148080,4154318,right this is exactly what i wanted  they're about five dollars each ten  dollars that's a really good deal i make  this two times a week oh really yeah all
8pL-DEjhatY,4154318,4159689,right we're gonna get out of here you  have your ingredients from the market  and you're gonna make it happen i can't  wait to see it
8pL-DEjhatY,4159689,4166080,[Applause]  so i'm about to make a dish that  combines a whole bunch of my favorite  dishes in zimbabwe first we need to
8pL-DEjhatY,4166080,4172400,start with i'll call them alfred and  junior food in zimbabwe is quite  straightforward almost every meat dish
8pL-DEjhatY,4172400,4178159,is either seasoned with just salt or if  the cook is feeling frisky they may also  toss in tomatoes and onions few of my
8pL-DEjhatY,4178159,4183920,favorite beans i don't know what this  bean is called but it's very yummy the  second one sugar beans and the third one
8pL-DEjhatY,4183920,4190719,mace  carl isn't trying to reinvent zimbabwe  cuisine instead he's combining mixing
8pL-DEjhatY,4190719,4197360,and blending unique flavors already  native to this land gonna put in some  onion garlic tomatoes green peppers
8pL-DEjhatY,4197360,4203440,and the final ingredient we've got  caterpillars which is our mopani worms  carpenter which is our salty fish and a
8pL-DEjhatY,4203440,4208640,couple of spices in here  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,4208640,4214790,that's gonna provide our seasoning cover  that for three hours  and have a couple of beers
8pL-DEjhatY,4214790,4220080,[Music]  this place is like a local rest stop a
8pL-DEjhatY,4220080,4226320,clump of businesses like bars butcheries  and street food vendors hoping to sell  to whoever stops by for those who don't
8pL-DEjhatY,4226320,4232080,have fresh water running in their homes  you need help they might get their water  like this here i can help you  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,4232080,4238080,oh all right you're doing pretty good by  yourself  you don't trust me do you  oh that's actually easier than i thought
8pL-DEjhatY,4238080,4244640,all right so this is the pump and this  is where you get fresh water it does  require some work and it does burn some  calories but basically it's like a giant
8pL-DEjhatY,4244640,4251920,lat machine and then look down there  she's drinking water  until this well goes about 40 meters  down it's uh over 100 feet very deep
8pL-DEjhatY,4251920,4257040,into the core of the earth where the  most delicious water is the only problem  is can i pump it and then run down there
8pL-DEjhatY,4257040,4262080,in time to drink it let's try pump  run
8pL-DEjhatY,4268960,4274400,it's delicious it tastes like metal that  makes sense oh yeah you know what maybe  i didn't have to rush after all it's
8pL-DEjhatY,4274400,4279440,still oh wait there's  another guy pumping  i thought i just pumped it so hard it
8pL-DEjhatY,4279440,4285360,just would keep coming forever for years  to come and everyone would talk about  the day that sonny came and blessed the  village but no there's just another guy
8pL-DEjhatY,4285360,4292640,fresh water that's how they do it here  very cool  while the pig heads continue to simmer  away i offered carl an appetizer i did
8pL-DEjhatY,4292640,4299199,what uh what did you kill some chicken  parts i got from a street vendor that  looks like a hot bird of some kind
8pL-DEjhatY,4299199,4305040,and mushrooms i bought from a random  villager mushrooms what kind of  mushrooms let's hope they're more  magical than poisonous they're a red
8pL-DEjhatY,4305040,4311199,mushroom they're from the bush and  they're edible they're edible okay and  so i met a gentleman my name is daous  right now i'm cooking some mushrooms
8pL-DEjhatY,4311199,4316560,we'll get them in the bush and then we  eat it's good in the body with a blue  like a highway construction jacket okay
8pL-DEjhatY,4316560,4322080,that's safe he said that's safe it means  he has a day job  this gentleman walked about half a mile
8pL-DEjhatY,4322080,4327760,into the bush to pick these i don't know  many i know these red ones a type of  wild mushroom whose name i was unable to
8pL-DEjhatY,4327760,4333679,track down in our language  regardless of what you've learned about  mario and his love for mushrooms this
8pL-DEjhatY,4333679,4339760,red color is usually associated with  poisonous or hallucinogenic mushrooms  but heck if this guy was going to eat
8pL-DEjhatY,4339760,4346800,them why not me i'm collecting mushrooms  once a week just eat we don't sell them  these are far too tough to eat raw they
8pL-DEjhatY,4346800,4352800,must be boiled for an hour then cooked  with a bit of oil and salt should we try  this yeah the red hue it was just on the
8pL-DEjhatY,4352800,4357920,cap top before and it's kind of spread  among all the mushroom now try it out  okay
8pL-DEjhatY,4357920,4363360,a little gritty that's very interesting  pretty good look a little fragrance to  it yeah a bit of a like sharp flavor not
8pL-DEjhatY,4363360,4368719,quite a truffle but there's something  nearly astringent about it it's very  immediate it's satisfying in the way  that meat is satisfied yeah you're
8pL-DEjhatY,4368719,4375250,introducing me to a new zimbabwean food  so you've never tried this one before  pretty awesome huh wow i could do this  on toast all day over here right
8pL-DEjhatY,4375250,4381760,[Music]  the gizzards are boiled with a bunch of  salt add intestines liver then hearts
8pL-DEjhatY,4381760,4387520,and coke  this is the best part it's both chewy
8pL-DEjhatY,4387520,4393280,and soft at the same time it's like  chewy in the most satisfying way  possible what are we going for  intestines yeah these are my favorite
8pL-DEjhatY,4393280,4398800,everyone fights for this when you're  eating oh it's all just a package look  at this heart intestine all together in
8pL-DEjhatY,4398800,4404560,some countries they didn't tie this to  the chicken feet i think i saw that in  the medium so you like it it's a good  snack i wanted to ask you some more
8pL-DEjhatY,4404560,4409920,questions about food here this is our  fifth video we've just gotten a good  first-handed snapshot yeah i'm so
8pL-DEjhatY,4409920,4416000,curious about the food and how it got to  the state it's in now so i want to ask  about colonization because that must  have changed a lot and then
8pL-DEjhatY,4416000,4422159,when did this country become independent  we got our independence in 1980 so you  were alive i was born like literally a
8pL-DEjhatY,4422159,4428239,year old that's wild remember we we're  nomads we travel with the land that kind  of thing so as colonization came we were
8pL-DEjhatY,4428239,4434960,put into different areas and so what  would happen is a man would start a new  family there bring a little bit of what  he has from home to a people that don't
8pL-DEjhatY,4434960,4440960,understand what he has so culinary  identity it changes completely then  let's start talking about new  ingredients being brought into the
8pL-DEjhatY,4440960,4446000,country maize easiest way to feed people  smaller grains were too inefficient to  grow not on mass you couldn't feed a
8pL-DEjhatY,4446000,4451040,country like that and that in a way  became what is known as traditional food  today in zimbabwe but it's not
8pL-DEjhatY,4451040,4457199,traditional  how do you get that back is it too late  there's a need to celebrate past  presence and future and i think each of
8pL-DEjhatY,4457199,4463120,us individually have an objective mind  is to understand our past see what we're  doing in the present and perhaps maybe
8pL-DEjhatY,4463120,4468280,come up with a new culinary identity in  future
8pL-DEjhatY,4468880,4475040,okay let's get this on the plate today's  dish is a beautiful reimagining of  zimbabwean flavors local ingredients you
8pL-DEjhatY,4475040,4482719,wouldn't usually see together combined  into an edible mosaic all that dumped on  rarely utilized pig pigheads
8pL-DEjhatY,4482719,4488719,this is going to be awesome or a  complete disaster let's find out look at  this christmas i call it romeo and
8pL-DEjhatY,4488719,4493840,juliet the pig crust lovers yes  so what i did is i just took ingredients
8pL-DEjhatY,4493840,4499810,that make up a lot of difference  development dishes and then we created a  spice blend using the worms and the fish
8pL-DEjhatY,4499810,4504960,[Music]  a little bit of a kick at the end of  this right so that is layered flavor
8pL-DEjhatY,4504960,4512000,yeah the flavor is super savory i think  the worm and the fish together  contributed a lot of flavor and we're  trying to avoid using salt on its own
8pL-DEjhatY,4512000,4517520,because a lot of these foods are cured  or dried using salt already i'm going to  try to grab this part here so we have a
8pL-DEjhatY,4517520,4523440,jowl the jar muscle i don't know what  you would call that oh yes i'm going to  just drench it in this gravy here
8pL-DEjhatY,4523440,4529280,oh wow delicious it's incredibly rich  super fatty what you can see inside  burrow in deeper there's a protein here
8pL-DEjhatY,4529280,4535520,mix it with the beans and the gravy  sauce  oh  and then the ear so it's been boiling
8pL-DEjhatY,4535520,4541040,just long enough that this is a thick  cartilage in the middle of the ear but  i'm able to just cut it down with a fork
8pL-DEjhatY,4541040,4547360,kind of crunching are you snappy getting  through that cartilage it's like the  most tender dainty ears i've ever seen  in my life that's awesome i noticed on
8pL-DEjhatY,4547360,4552400,the side what's this you remember the  baobab stuff that we found
8pL-DEjhatY,4552400,4557600,when you eat baobab it's like having six  oranges so what i did is i made a  cocktail using a locally made liquor
8pL-DEjhatY,4557600,4563760,with a bit of orange soda and the baobab  and this one's just for me you're not  drinking it i'm gonna have this what's  that this is a beer that's almost made
8pL-DEjhatY,4563760,4569679,from  porridge oh oh did you mix with fanta  too huh yeah that will make you sneak
8pL-DEjhatY,4569679,4575679,for the rest of the day i like it i  taste a little bit of the fruit you put  in there too a bit but also the fanta  has a strong presence
8pL-DEjhatY,4575679,4580880,all right where do we go in here we want  to open this guy up we have to work as a  tv yeah open it up i got it so that
8pL-DEjhatY,4580880,4586640,should just split oh it's like it's  yawning here there's a lot to work with  here the roof of the mouth the soft  palate the tongue what do you want you
8pL-DEjhatY,4586640,4592719,want to go for the tongue yeah but you  don't break the exterior out no no just  leave it like this it is yeah i got some  front tongue you got some back tongue
8pL-DEjhatY,4592719,4598480,let's try it out  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,4598480,4603840,the tongue is such a beautiful texture  it's so different from any other part  and when it gets steamed or boiled for a  long time maybe i use this too much but
8pL-DEjhatY,4603840,4610239,i say it's kind of like almost become a  pate absolutely you know this is the  first time i've had pork so far in  zimbabwe oh yeah because we're very
8pL-DEjhatY,4610239,4615440,religious and i think it's also because  people don't know how to handle the fat  and so people just shy away from pork
8pL-DEjhatY,4615440,4620800,entirely really yeah they gravitate to  the scripture of jesus putting demons in  the pigs now why would jesus do that
8pL-DEjhatY,4620800,4625920,because the demons wanted some way to go  oh there were too many of them so jesus  told them to go into the pigs can i tell
8pL-DEjhatY,4625920,4630960,you something yeah i taste zero demons  no demons are killed in the making of  this meal i have a very nuanced palette
8pL-DEjhatY,4630960,4638560,so here we have the top of the head let  me flip this guy around i think i could  go from the forehead and almost like  peel off the skin here whoa and whatever
8pL-DEjhatY,4638560,4643810,that is yeah we're trying to get into  the brain oh dude cheek meat hold on  before brain you should grab the cheek  meat on that okay
8pL-DEjhatY,4643810,4648960,[Music]  man it's that perfect ratio tender  sticky meat rendered down fat that's
8pL-DEjhatY,4648960,4654000,awesome so we're going to go for the  eyes now the eyes  so using your fork at the bottom here
8pL-DEjhatY,4654000,4660159,pop out here  whoa that was one of the best eye pulls  i've ever seen let's see if i can match  that
8pL-DEjhatY,4660159,4666400,oh  i got it but you got the retina going  that connects all the way up to the  brain everything we've tried so far i
8pL-DEjhatY,4666400,4673199,like in earnest and i'm not just like  pretending right i'm not a big fan of  the eyes neither might so what i do is i  have to spoon a bit of the put some
8pL-DEjhatY,4673199,4678360,gravy on it yeah pig eyeball you ready  big eyeballs
8pL-DEjhatY,4679280,4685360,it's good you know what it's all in my  mind it's all in my mind it doesn't feel  i like right no i'm far too aware that  it's an eyeball i can feel it like
8pL-DEjhatY,4685360,4690719,breaking apart my mouth and so eyeball's  pretty gamey too maybe you had glaucoma
8pL-DEjhatY,4690719,4697360,all right so we have tried a lot we've  gotten to really know this pig  intimately there's one more part which  is the brain get this fork in there

8pL-DEjhatY,4802480,4808080,this a breakfast of tea and bread may  sound familiar to most but the way this  bread was made is truly unique so this
8pL-DEjhatY,4808080,4812638,is a kitchen it does lack maybe like a  fan
8pL-DEjhatY,4814159,4819199,smoke is medicine for the eyes that's  fantastic right here we have the bread
8pL-DEjhatY,4819199,4824560,this is a mixture of cornmeal and  sorghum and water that makes a batter  and instead of being something like saza
8pL-DEjhatY,4824560,4831360,which you see all the time it's much  more dense and they caked it to the  walls of the pan and then the water on  the bottom bubbles and steams up cooking
8pL-DEjhatY,4831360,4837840,the batter by way of steaming it well  you know what i'm getting used to the  smoke i feel good my eyes feel great i'm  supposed to have tears right that's good
8pL-DEjhatY,4837840,4843040,yeah  while i flee in search of oxygen the  bread stays to bake for another 30
8pL-DEjhatY,4843040,4848320,minutes then it's ready to serve this  looks good
8pL-DEjhatY,4848880,4854800,how is it really interesting flavor it  tastes like whole wheat although it's  not wheat at all but it has that whole  grain kind of taste to it the crunchy
8pL-DEjhatY,4854800,4861040,part that's good right  a little bit of tea mr mpc was born in  the mid lands i was born in 1944 but for
8pL-DEjhatY,4861040,4868639,most of his life this is the place he's  called home how long have you been in  this area since 1955 wow
8pL-DEjhatY,4868800,4874080,trying to do the math hold on i was a  terrible student his village is just 12  miles from the rapidly expanding city of
8pL-DEjhatY,4874080,4879198,victoria falls over time it's changed a  lot
8pL-DEjhatY,4879330,4885600,[Music]  when we came here in 1955 it was bush  there is only one hotel the victoria
8pL-DEjhatY,4885600,4891679,falls hotel white people were only five  who were living in victoria first during  that time but now it's a city so back
8pL-DEjhatY,4891679,4898159,then did you dress like this  what did you wear  from the animals you would haunt and  what kind of animals did you hunt any
8pL-DEjhatY,4898159,4904719,animal was hunted during the giraffe yes  i just got a good testament oh giraffe  has good meat as the world around in pcs
8pL-DEjhatY,4904719,4910560,village becomes more and more modern  traditions and customs become harder to  maintain it's not that outside forces
8pL-DEjhatY,4910560,4916159,are putting an end to what happens here  but young rebellious youth in any  culture tend to seek out what's trendy
8pL-DEjhatY,4916159,4923040,new and different  today you're going to be making goat how
8pL-DEjhatY,4923040,4929280,often does this happen every weekend you  should have a coat because my  grandchildren are coming they should  have something to eat so you go through
8pL-DEjhatY,4929280,4933198,52 goats a year that's a lot of goats
8pL-DEjhatY,4938000,4944800,[Applause]  pc's village consists of several tribes
8pL-DEjhatY,4944800,4951360,that make up one family and pc belongs  to the independe tribe his wife from the  tonga tribe two of the major ethnic
8pL-DEjhatY,4951360,4957520,groups in zimbabwe  about once a week they gather to  celebrate life
8pL-DEjhatY,4957520,4962880,that means singing  dancing
8pL-DEjhatY,4963360,4970400,praying  drinking so this is like breakfast  number two but this one gets you drunk  yeah
8pL-DEjhatY,4970719,4975920,it's good real thick just drink with  food yeah  [Music]  [Applause]
8pL-DEjhatY,4975920,4981600,with their hearts full and their  stomachs empty it's time to slaughter a  goat
8pL-DEjhatY,4981600,4987330,dispatch  drain
8pL-DEjhatY,4987330,4992719,[Music]  butcher  and cook
8pL-DEjhatY,4992719,5000480,from nose to tail this goat will become  several dishes that will feed many first  up because it's the easiest to spoil
8pL-DEjhatY,5000480,5005760,blood with chopped ovals blood is good  food we have to cook it there are  certain parts
8pL-DEjhatY,5005760,5014320,and so forth a little bit of liver put  it  with blood so that we mix it and cook it  together the pile is also all the bile
8pL-DEjhatY,5014320,5019960,it's full of very very bitter green  liquid that green liquid mix is an
8pL-DEjhatY,5019960,5025040,anti-inflammatory even if you've got cow  i'll help yes wow this is going to be
8pL-DEjhatY,5025040,5031600,quite the starter  course the pot is seasoned with salt and  placed on the stove
8pL-DEjhatY,5031600,5037040,as the blood turns over the heat it  changes from scarlet to a muddy black
8pL-DEjhatY,5037040,5042800,here blood represents being so eating  blood means gaining life so the blood is
8pL-DEjhatY,5042800,5047360,finished it's not blood now it's food  rice food
8pL-DEjhatY,5047920,5054320,i did have goat blood with that on my  first day in zimbabwe good morning  tastes better than i thought but here we  have the bile mixed in so it should be
8pL-DEjhatY,5054320,5061199,more bitter right tasty this is blood  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,5061199,5067120,good food  i love the texture but it's very sticky  it's salty but it's like naturally salty
8pL-DEjhatY,5067120,5072620,i don't taste any bitterness the bile is  in there oh cool oh this one's liver
8pL-DEjhatY,5072620,5078159,[Music]  why no i don't know  i mean classic liver flavor much more
8pL-DEjhatY,5078159,5083840,firm solid that's wild so are you  usually eating this first that's what  you eat
8pL-DEjhatY,5085600,5091280,[Music]  the fat is really gummy like it's  impossible to chew but you just squeeze
8pL-DEjhatY,5091280,5096639,all the flavor out of it yes and there's  delicious oils you never get sick of  this no no no no no sit you can't even
8pL-DEjhatY,5096639,5102639,check it never gets pointed you do that  sometimes you hide it for yourself  i'm told that you also do african
8pL-DEjhatY,5102639,5108639,medicine yes do you call it african  medicine or do you call it something  else smith does it that makes sense  you're in africa
8pL-DEjhatY,5108639,5115120,zimbabwe has a long history of using  plants for medicinal purposes a practice  most locals still opt for that is
8pL-DEjhatY,5115120,5120239,devil's law it's good even for malaria  and it heals heart problems can you heal
8pL-DEjhatY,5120239,5126639,a broken heart  this rich medical knowledge is passed  down from generation to generation pc
8pL-DEjhatY,5126639,5132239,learned his craft from his grandfather  this one there are some people can't  even make a woman pretend that's what
8pL-DEjhatY,5132239,5137520,you use how many kids do you have only  seven  okay though many may dismiss traditional
8pL-DEjhatY,5137520,5143679,medicine without a second thought it may  be sobering to know that fully forty  percent of modern medicines are derived
8pL-DEjhatY,5143679,5149679,from plants even if you are coughing  what if you got packaged headaches you  just put it in water take aspirin for
8pL-DEjhatY,5149679,5155679,example launched into the world from  willow bark oh i mean it tastes like  medicine it's very bitter right now the
8pL-DEjhatY,5155679,5162080,only medicinal healing i need is from  food and i'm in luck  i like your style here it's like little
8pL-DEjhatY,5162080,5168639,appetizers throughout the day yes this  here is grilled goat liver using the  goat's skin as a cutting board chop the
8pL-DEjhatY,5168639,5175550,liver open and spread it on a mesh grill  with some fat on top  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,5177440,5183920,a little bit different feeling because  before it was boiled in the different  tests when you're eating food you should  have a varieties of chests you're
8pL-DEjhatY,5183920,5188960,speaking my language  variety is the spice of life so the  other one was more full of water really
8pL-DEjhatY,5188960,5194159,soft this is a little more like chewy  and like a harder outside some smokiness  i like it it's almost like a jerky how
8pL-DEjhatY,5194159,5199440,long can you save this for a few days  you can put it in this  for some days in many rural areas like
8pL-DEjhatY,5199440,5204960,this hanging and smoking is the most  effective way to preserve freshly  butchered meat hanging food here in this
8pL-DEjhatY,5204960,5211120,part of africa scares me because i even  saw baboons in the city  do baboons ever come here they do and do
8pL-DEjhatY,5211120,5216159,they ever attack your village no no  we still have this world like us human
8pL-DEjhatY,5216159,5221760,beings they've got a role in our society  don't give wild animals food which is
8pL-DEjhatY,5221760,5227440,eaten by human beings they changed their  behavior but if we live in harmony we  talk to them they move away really you
8pL-DEjhatY,5227440,5233679,can see lions they come to you pretend  as if you've got a lot of energy  approach them don't fear they can feel
8pL-DEjhatY,5233679,5242158,that you fear inside your heart they run  away but if you attack they fight you so  no animal is dangerous as human beings
8pL-DEjhatY,5244159,5253040,during mpc's lifetime he's experienced a  transition from game meat to pasture  animals and even these
8pL-DEjhatY,5253040,5258560,rabbits are prized for their lean meat  but just as much for their fur holy cow
8pL-DEjhatY,5258560,5263760,this is a rabbit skin blanket made from  36 rabbits i saw it this one when you
8pL-DEjhatY,5263760,5268960,put it is very good  i like it like this normally the rabbits
8pL-DEjhatY,5268960,5276320,are dispatched carefully skinned and  sized up for the blanket this one's one  hey maybe you can make a pillow case yes
8pL-DEjhatY,5276320,5284639,the remaining carcass is grilled over  charcoal with a touch of salt  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,5284639,5289760,pt said i had his permission to enjoy  the rabbit to try it out and he said  that the rabbit is one of the most
8pL-DEjhatY,5289760,5296159,nutritious animals they have they said  more nutritious than chicken more than  beef and i think possibly even more than  goat i'm gonna try this part right here
8pL-DEjhatY,5296159,5301440,these little things non-testicles that  would be down there these are kidneys it  looks like a wood tick that sucked on a
8pL-DEjhatY,5301440,5306960,dog for too long and got big and fat  yummy  [Applause]  it's just like juicy almost tastes like
8pL-DEjhatY,5306960,5312159,sausage i mean so far this trip in  zimbabwe we've been eating a load of  meat cow sheep we're gonna have goats
8pL-DEjhatY,5312159,5318400,soon we've had rabbit we've had chicken  we've had guinea fowl fish you name it  people here really like and appreciate
8pL-DEjhatY,5318400,5325120,meat and so do i is that the heart it  could be the heart oh no mr nbc said he  could fix a broken heart is it too late
8pL-DEjhatY,5325120,5330480,[Music]  let's try it out  oh it's awesome i'm going to break this
8pL-DEjhatY,5330480,5335679,back leg off there we go but take a look  at this meat super white very lean and  it's probably not going to be juicy i'm
8pL-DEjhatY,5335679,5341440,guessing the juiciest part was that  kidney we'll try out  a bit firm but not bad at all this is
8pL-DEjhatY,5341440,5346800,quite delicious it's not really dry you  think it'd be a lot more dry for being  just a lean rabbit it's a little chewy
8pL-DEjhatY,5346800,5352719,man i'm falling in love with the  smokiness of it and all my times coming  to africa this is one of my most unique  experiences so far i know we're just
8pL-DEjhatY,5352719,5357760,mid-video i'm giving you a mid-video  update it's kind of heartbreaking when  you realize and see and experience how
8pL-DEjhatY,5357760,5363120,beautiful the traditions are here and  you know that what you see today is  still a diluted version of what once was
8pL-DEjhatY,5363120,5368560,right now in bc the family they're  finishing up the goat the real main meal  is about to begin so
8pL-DEjhatY,5368560,5374400,a very good one  like many tribes around africa some of
8pL-DEjhatY,5374400,5380159,the sacrificed animal parts are strictly  allocated to men what we eat earlier  that's for men and others to women
8pL-DEjhatY,5380159,5386800,depressed or short-lived concerns for  women for dinner today we've got sorghum  zaza african cabbage and something known
8pL-DEjhatY,5386800,5392239,as zanienze more on that soon so i've  got some of the african cabbage
8pL-DEjhatY,5392239,5398080,oh yeah that's so fresh but it's a  little bit bigger do you put bile in  this nothing okay oh so this is  something i've never seen before this is
8pL-DEjhatY,5398080,5404320,a piece of goat tripe wrapped tight with  intestines  the ingredients or should i say the
8pL-DEjhatY,5404320,5410080,goat's stomach and intestines are  thoroughly cleaned and then cut down to  size
8pL-DEjhatY,5410080,5415280,[Music]  each piece of tripe is wrapped with  intestine forming an elongated
8pL-DEjhatY,5415280,5421600,sausage-like  shape now boil these works of art with
8pL-DEjhatY,5421600,5427120,salt until they reach the desired level  of tenderness  [Music]
8pL-DEjhatY,5427120,5433679,that's so cool but it looks pretty  gnarly too  oh my god like a perfume or a field of
8pL-DEjhatY,5433679,5439120,daisies that's good food idea smells so  good
8pL-DEjhatY,5439640,5445679,[Applause]  [Music]  uh-huh  okay
8pL-DEjhatY,5445679,5450800,the taste is better than the smell can i  say that it's better than the smell  i love the texture it's like squishy
8pL-DEjhatY,5450800,5457520,squeaky like some over cooked calamari  i've mixed the sausage with it to dilute  the flavor a little bit  what's your favorite part
8pL-DEjhatY,5457520,5463360,right here i gotta say the more i take  bites the more i like it it smells of  gastric acid but when you're eating it  it's not really bitter i'm just kind of
8pL-DEjhatY,5463360,5468639,savory what do you think big fan  too much i like that
8pL-DEjhatY,5469199,5475199,as you may have noticed men and women  tend to sit and eat separately women can  talk about women's stuff and guys can
8pL-DEjhatY,5475199,5480400,talk about guy stuff that's what in pc  says  so what are some of the main issues you
8pL-DEjhatY,5480400,5486400,know it's hard to tell women that i have  lost of lipitor i have one loss of  lipids oh yeah no one wants to admit
8pL-DEjhatY,5486400,5492320,that but we can discuss it if we are men  together instead of discussing my own  libido status i figure it's better to
8pL-DEjhatY,5492320,5498800,move on to the next topic the goat leg  grilled over fire until it's well done
8pL-DEjhatY,5498800,5506320,and seasoned with a bit of salt  [Music]  oh yeah i can't wait to try this out
8pL-DEjhatY,5506560,5513280,oh yeah  very nice  [Music]  super smokey are you using mopane wood  yes
8pL-DEjhatY,5513280,5518480,great flavor it's juicy and tender on  the inside almost no gamey goat flavor  at all it's like the opposite of the
8pL-DEjhatY,5518480,5523600,intestines in the stomach it's so  different it's so different but now it's  just better because they've tested that
8pL-DEjhatY,5523600,5529760,one  that is part of the flavoring that makes  sense i like that  i want to ask throughout the day i've
8pL-DEjhatY,5529760,5535040,gotten your perspective on what it's  been like to grow up in this area and to  see the world around you change so much
8pL-DEjhatY,5535040,5540080,now you're an elder you have children  grandchildren great grandchildren what  do you want for your great grandchildren
8pL-DEjhatY,5540080,5545199,as they grow up the young people they  like to depend while changing their  mindset educate them let them be
8pL-DEjhatY,5545199,5551679,involved teach them all survival skills  in order to survive every now tough it  is we work as a team to collectively
8pL-DEjhatY,5551679,5560000,that collectivity makes us to cause some  us choosing our own just not to be  planned by other people see the sunlight
