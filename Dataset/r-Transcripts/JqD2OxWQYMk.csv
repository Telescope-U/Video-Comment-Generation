JqD2OxWQYMk,486000,492400,i'm just a better player but there's  just more of them i should be getting  names but i'm like rage insta killing

JqD2OxWQYMk,504319,509360,have a chance to uh to see what their  names are  yeah i mean that is what it is look
JqD2OxWQYMk,509360,514479,they're building a new base even holy  [ __ ] dude  that's gonna be terrible
JqD2OxWQYMk,514479,519839,they're literally building a new base  like right next to us  so motion and i just got the short end
JqD2OxWQYMk,519839,526240,of the stick we put in the work and  pretty much wiped a four-man group but  at the last moment another group who i'm
JqD2OxWQYMk,526240,532560,calling the cleanup crew came in and  without doing much stole it all from us  motion had to take a quick snack break
JqD2OxWQYMk,532560,539760,which left me to deal with a new problem  we had new neighbors at first i thought  it was vitally and elusive the cleanup
JqD2OxWQYMk,539760,546959,crew but i'd soon find out that it  wasn't regardless it was bad news all  the same i decided to head over there to
JqD2OxWQYMk,546959,552399,find out who they were without motion  around there wasn't a lot of progression  i could do myself
JqD2OxWQYMk,552399,557760,i guess these guys went to go for a  quick lunch break or something because  they're completely inactive in there now
JqD2OxWQYMk,557760,564600,i think it's better that i just go in  and farm harbor  anyways
JqD2OxWQYMk,565820,568889,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,574850,580080,[Music]  oh my god
JqD2OxWQYMk,581600,587519,alex the burrito get to know good to  know  dude i've been down bad like this before
JqD2OxWQYMk,587519,594000,just need to come back from this man  it's not going to be that hard  there is still hope it was at this point
JqD2OxWQYMk,594000,599600,that our boxes were looking pretty grim  we had no bows and not even enough cloth
JqD2OxWQYMk,599600,606399,to make any more winning those first  couple of primitive fights is essential  to a clean start we may have lost those
JqD2OxWQYMk,606399,613200,first few fights but we had a base we  had furnaces pumping and we even started  to meet our enemies
JqD2OxWQYMk,613200,619040,this run was certainly not dead  so while waiting for motion to get back
JqD2OxWQYMk,619040,625560,i headed to harbor for a resource run  with nothing but a bone knife
JqD2OxWQYMk,625730,635548,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,639070,646640,[Music]  alrighty yo  yo  so i just got eight 600 metal frags and
JqD2OxWQYMk,646640,652640,12 rope and 120 scrap from harbor so now  we can make more crossbows and stuff
JqD2OxWQYMk,652640,658880,and we can actually compete  after a quick monument run we were back  on our feet i made us both crossbows
JqD2OxWQYMk,658880,664720,with nail guns and we headed to  lighthouse to try and find that green  key card controlling small oil rig was
JqD2OxWQYMk,664720,671360,still our goal we just needed to begin  work on finding key cards to achieve it
JqD2OxWQYMk,672720,678800,he's on fire  oh my god he's shooting cannonball at me  hold on hit you that hurts i hit him
JqD2OxWQYMk,678800,683759,twice he's down  there's dudes on a kayak bro
JqD2OxWQYMk,684800,689920,hit the guy swimming there's people on  the open too i'm gonna go down there
JqD2OxWQYMk,689920,694000,i tagged that guy at the two by two oh  i'm tagged
JqD2OxWQYMk,694959,705040,where is that whoa i'm dead above  this one  he's full dead what the [ __ ] he's loaded
JqD2OxWQYMk,705040,713160,it's alex oh no and he has his grenius  so much  that's our neighbor [ __ ]
JqD2OxWQYMk,714920,722240,[Music]  500 cloth from that easy and we got
JqD2OxWQYMk,722240,728240,green card which we can go to harvard  right now yeah i'm done so we began  working towards our goal of taking oil
JqD2OxWQYMk,728240,734880,rig by getting that green card from our  neighbor alex at lighthouse with green  we were going to get blue from harbor
JqD2OxWQYMk,734880,740399,which sounded easy enough but we went  there over and over and over again and
JqD2OxWQYMk,740399,747600,every time we did it was already looted  we were eventually able to scrounge up  enough scrap for a tier 2 but without
JqD2OxWQYMk,747600,755279,key cards it was hard to progress and if  we weren't looting harbor for the blue  card somebody else was who that was
JqD2OxWQYMk,755279,763760,became obvious on our way to check if  the room had respawned again  metal metal hatchet farming right here
JqD2OxWQYMk,764720,772000,get him  he said there's another one far away
JqD2OxWQYMk,772000,777120,okay  tommy  wow
JqD2OxWQYMk,777839,783600,yeah yeah tommy's pushing  no oh there's a crossbow going either
JqD2OxWQYMk,783600,791120,i'm gonna pull back you should fall back  with me  mr tummy oh i'm dead
JqD2OxWQYMk,791120,798320,all right  i'm head shot  [Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,798320,801480,all right
JqD2OxWQYMk,805200,810880,tommy's right there by the way  no i'm down i'm dead
JqD2OxWQYMk,813440,815839,hit him
JqD2OxWQYMk,822000,829040,hit him  i don't know how he has so much  hp don't know i don't understand how he
JqD2OxWQYMk,829040,834240,has a tommy either so there it is we  lost our green key card and once again
JqD2OxWQYMk,834240,839360,we're forced to craft new gear sets who  was the culprits the cleanup crew
JqD2OxWQYMk,839360,846399,because vitaly was at the scene roaming  alongside the tommy guy who was named  cash we now have the full team on our
JqD2OxWQYMk,846399,851680,watch list they were a trio so far which  was nothing we couldn't handle but every
JqD2OxWQYMk,851680,857519,time we tried to progress they'd show up  with guns uh hazmat up the hill
JqD2OxWQYMk,857519,860880,well i'm getting i'm getting rushed
JqD2OxWQYMk,864560,870480,two tommy's i'm dead two tummies it's  the same guys from before if we had guns  on the other hand it would be a
JqD2OxWQYMk,870480,876320,different story but for now our area  wasn't safe to farm in so instead of  heading towards harbor which is where
JqD2OxWQYMk,876320,882480,they were we headed towards junkyard  what the hell now
JqD2OxWQYMk,882480,890160,i don't know man i guess we got to keep  hitting up harbor or go lighthouse to  get another green card i mean this is  just aids
JqD2OxWQYMk,891760,895560,i domed one of the nakeds
JqD2OxWQYMk,898000,903680,we can just get scrap  texturing is an option

JqD2OxWQYMk,1029520,1035319,wait there's a boat at lighthouse dude  i'm going for that
JqD2OxWQYMk,1038959,1046319,this was easily the best run of the  wipes so far not only did we get a ton  of scrap to research with but we got our
JqD2OxWQYMk,1046319,1052640,first decent weapon of the wipe the  double barrel shotgun from running  tunnels we also found slugs this
JqD2OxWQYMk,1052640,1059520,essentially turns it into a two-round  sar so we researched both of those right  away not only this but we also found a
JqD2OxWQYMk,1059520,1065840,boat during that run we knew that this  would come in handy later when we  started taking oil rig and even cargo so
JqD2OxWQYMk,1065840,1073039,we decided to start building a boat base  it was during the construction of this  that we made an intriguing discovery
JqD2OxWQYMk,1073039,1076919,[ __ ] i need more stone
JqD2OxWQYMk,1081600,1087280,wait what the [ __ ] this guy's door is  wide open did you see that  run
JqD2OxWQYMk,1087280,1091520,this one right here  why is it open

JqD2OxWQYMk,1120000,1127760,i i honestly think they just forgot to  close their doors that is such a big  mistake i got a door in a codelock
JqD2OxWQYMk,1127760,1133200,slap it on  wow
JqD2OxWQYMk,1133919,1141280,ask and you shall receive  i needed stone to finish our boat base  so what better way to get three rows of
JqD2OxWQYMk,1141280,1146559,it than from alex the burrito our  neighbors for some reason they left both
JqD2OxWQYMk,1146559,1154000,of their doors open which allowed us to  easily eco-raid into their base it was  yet another big win to give us more loot
JqD2OxWQYMk,1154000,1160720,and also some peace of mind our area  just got a whole lot easier to live in  and with the boat base finished we were
JqD2OxWQYMk,1160720,1167520,ready to roam with a surprise eviction  like that on alex we did not expect it  to happen again today but sometimes in
JqD2OxWQYMk,1167520,1174799,rust when the ball starts rolling it  doesn't stop there's a bow  just like headshot perhaps
JqD2OxWQYMk,1174799,1180720,i shot him  he's gone there's another one  hit him

JqD2OxWQYMk,1322799,1328320,that that p2 guy literally came out of  nowhere there's three now  they're all getting in the water
JqD2OxWQYMk,1328320,1334480,swimming uh northeast  yeah yeah right on me i'm literally like  right behind them
JqD2OxWQYMk,1334480,1341120,i'm respawning to try and do something  after dying to a trio at lighthouse with  p2s and revolvers i noticed they were
JqD2OxWQYMk,1341120,1346720,taking a weird route when leaving  instead of beelining either beach which  would get you out of the water faster
JqD2OxWQYMk,1346720,1352559,they decided to cut through the middle  this suggested that they lived close by  and sure enough when we went back with
JqD2OxWQYMk,1352559,1360360,dbs we found an active 2x2 and the exact  trajectory they were swimming to
JqD2OxWQYMk,1360480,1367000,what the [ __ ]  that might come out  i'm down
JqD2OxWQYMk,1367840,1370880,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1375200,1378320,i don't know can you kill this guy
JqD2OxWQYMk,1382640,1389840,please  undead  kill them i'm in what

JqD2OxWQYMk,1400400,1407520,let's keep killing him i got outside  there's a tier 2 in here man oh my god  holy [ __ ]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1409120,1416480,bro  so loaded  oh wait i can throw so loaded yeah that
JqD2OxWQYMk,1416480,1424000,was the group we just fought so yeah  that's insane  within an hour we took over three bases
JqD2OxWQYMk,1424000,1430480,and with this one being the most loaded  it was safe to say that this wipe was  back on track sometimes in rust your
JqD2OxWQYMk,1430480,1436799,wipes don't go smoothly but all it takes  is some persistence and a little  determination and things can turn around
JqD2OxWQYMk,1436799,1443200,so once when the base was sealed i tech  tree dropbox and used it to transfer out  lou to motion with all of the resources
JqD2OxWQYMk,1443200,1449360,we've accumulated from these bases i  started to fortify our own and once when  it was in a decent enough state i
JqD2OxWQYMk,1449360,1455759,researched and crafted p2s to kick off  our first roam with guns
JqD2OxWQYMk,1456080,1460559,i got the zipline again yeah i guess
JqD2OxWQYMk,1468559,1472919,i'm getting p dude pizza
JqD2OxWQYMk,1479840,1482840,twice

JqD2OxWQYMk,1524080,1529840,let's push us we can push it yeah  once that results

JqD2OxWQYMk,1540080,1547840,get one of those  above above second floor oh are you dead
JqD2OxWQYMk,1547840,1553360,yep  i'm coming back  in him twice

JqD2OxWQYMk,1564960,1572400,dude these nakeds are just like zipping  in on a zipline  [Music]  with the yokas
JqD2OxWQYMk,1573919,1580960,oh my god guys coming in on zip lines  holy [ __ ] dude there's so many of them i
JqD2OxWQYMk,1580960,1588000,have everything by the way but i there's  so [ __ ] many people here  i mean should i come help like oh wait
JqD2OxWQYMk,1588000,1595279,check this take this just go back home  i'll  i'll deal with them  that was a great starting fight with our
JqD2OxWQYMk,1595279,1601520,first actual gun one of the things i  like most about four swipe is how  natural the progress can be we went from
JqD2OxWQYMk,1601520,1607520,crossbows to double barrels to p2s and  now to pythons but this phase didn't
JqD2OxWQYMk,1607520,1613360,last long motion and i killed a  straggler at harbor with a thompson  which turned into even better news when
JqD2OxWQYMk,1613360,1620320,we found out it had a holo on it as well  thompson hollow is meta right now so if  we can get these in both of our hands
JqD2OxWQYMk,1620320,1627039,we'd be set so of course we researched  the pair and then we headed to tunnels  to get more scrap components and smg
JqD2OxWQYMk,1627039,1632400,bodies to make the thompsons but here's  the issue we ran tunnels for the better
JqD2OxWQYMk,1632400,1638320,part of half an hour and we found just  one smg body by the time we got it home
JqD2OxWQYMk,1638320,1644559,it was getting late especially for  motion so right before he hopped off we  decided to continue the hunt for smg
JqD2OxWQYMk,1644559,1650720,bodies the next day but before i hopped  off for the day i wanted to farm some  upkeep for the base that's when i heard
JqD2OxWQYMk,1650720,1656640,another underground train stop under  harbor so i stopped what i was doing to  see if i could intercept them at the
JqD2OxWQYMk,1656640,1663279,exit  oh my god someone's calling it right now
JqD2OxWQYMk,1664240,1672270,dude if i had something that was in a  python right now  [Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1686890,1690599,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1697570,1703360,[Music]  what the [ __ ] am i dead to man

JqD2OxWQYMk,1722980,1726169,[Applause]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1731760,1738399,once again i was hoping for another smg  body but i guess another inventory of  components would have to do this was
JqD2OxWQYMk,1738399,1746960,enough of a win to satisfy me for the  day so i sealed our bunker and went  offline for the night
JqD2OxWQYMk,1746960,1757089,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1763210,1768799,[Music]  okay day two
JqD2OxWQYMk,1768799,1774799,and we are not offlined  yay  finding out we weren't offlined was
JqD2OxWQYMk,1774799,1781039,great today was going to be an  action-packed day but due to our time  differences i woke up an hour or so
JqD2OxWQYMk,1781039,1786960,before motion would during that time i  decided to do some node farming and  while i was out there i checked on our
JqD2OxWQYMk,1786960,1793679,shop i built last night i basically sold  the extra tier 2 workbench we got from  going deep as well as some extra p2s and
JqD2OxWQYMk,1793679,1800399,revolvers when i woke up this morning we  ended up with  925 scrap from it so it was well worth
JqD2OxWQYMk,1800399,1805919,doing nodes weren't the only thing i  farmed while i was out there however i  also ended up farming a couple of
JqD2OxWQYMk,1805919,1808919,players
JqD2OxWQYMk,1812020,1817640,[Music]  oh my god yes
JqD2OxWQYMk,1820850,1828559,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,1828559,1833600,bruh  that guy saw me and he decided to push
JqD2OxWQYMk,1833600,1838960,me like an idiot and now i have a blue  card which is really nice uh we can get  a red one now now that i finally had a
JqD2OxWQYMk,1838960,1846240,blue card i decided to do the airfield  puzzle to get a red one with blue and  red we could finally do small oil rig
JqD2OxWQYMk,1846240,1853279,the plan was to recycle first and then  head to oil rig but then we heard an  mlrs raid in the distance i got an
JqD2OxWQYMk,1853279,1860320,inventory of comps so i figured we could  go to lighthouse and recycle and then  our shop made 925 scrap overnight so now
JqD2OxWQYMk,1860320,1866480,we have like 2500 strap we could like  make tier three and like tech tree  explosive ammo if you really wanted but
JqD2OxWQYMk,1866480,1872240,i also got a red card blue card we can  do oil now wow  yeah
JqD2OxWQYMk,1872240,1876360,yeah let's do it i'm down
JqD2OxWQYMk,1878480,1883600,oh my god someone's getting mlrest  that was so close

JqD2OxWQYMk,1895200,1901039,are you close yeah to your left i only  have paws in there so it's gonna be a  bit tricky
JqD2OxWQYMk,1903679,1909420,oh my god there's so many  i'm watching myself  he's pushing my right

JqD2OxWQYMk,1964880,1970080,i'm sitting in the tree i have no other  options  yeah i'm just going to go die out in the
JqD2OxWQYMk,1970080,1975518,open  i'm dead
JqD2OxWQYMk,1975679,1982399,i'm in the tree and they don't see me  i'm dead
JqD2OxWQYMk,1982399,1988399,i get it i get dead nice  no  i'm dead oh my god that fight may have
JqD2OxWQYMk,1988399,1995039,resulted in losing our only thompson but  we had the chance to make profit on our  way back
JqD2OxWQYMk,1995039,2000240,titan  i'm down  [Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,2000240,2006880,he should be dead yeah he's dead  oh i'm going for it  dude he had his cards and everything
JqD2OxWQYMk,2006880,2012320,he's trying to look for you  so there's a hazmat on top of the rock  right now the big rock
JqD2OxWQYMk,2013840,2019039,nice he's dead  nice play do you wanna drop a python
JqD2OxWQYMk,2021840,2028640,we started that whole fight with one  thompson and ended up with two seeing as  smg bodies are deciding to just not
JqD2OxWQYMk,2028640,2036320,spawn for us this was a much needed win  now that we both had thompsons it was  finally time to check out oil rig it was
JqD2OxWQYMk,2036320,2043679,the reason we built in this area the  reason we built a boat base and the main  goal for the entire wipe but then after
JqD2OxWQYMk,2043679,2050960,the fact we had no idea why there was no  counters and other than finally getting  a few smg bodies the loot was pretty
JqD2OxWQYMk,2050960,2057760,average the real goal for this wipe has  been in front of us all along and that  was the pvp we've been getting in this
JqD2OxWQYMk,2057760,2062800,area specifically from the cleanup crew  so after doing a massive recycle run and
JqD2OxWQYMk,2062800,2069679,making a tier three workbench we decided  to go on a roam in our area again  expecting to face vitally cash and
JqD2OxWQYMk,2069679,2076158,elusive but instead we met somebody else  i'll tell you guys ahead
JqD2OxWQYMk,2079280,2084240,one day  oh he's not behind the palm trees
JqD2OxWQYMk,2084878,2089838,three times on tommy twice on the python
JqD2OxWQYMk,2091919,2097839,iphone's getting python by another  python oh my god  is possible i love stu i don't know  you're just getting python he might have
JqD2OxWQYMk,2097839,2103839,died  yeah he died  the tommy guy's running

JqD2OxWQYMk,2131040,2136240,headshot him there's a close python  he's inside the base
JqD2OxWQYMk,2136240,2139839,oh you scared me to meet me
JqD2OxWQYMk,2143440,2149680,oh the guy i hit once was at 27. he  might be down behind that wall it looks  clear yeah he's dead i think they're
JqD2OxWQYMk,2149680,2156320,both in here  yeah it's the cc  it's cece jessica
JqD2OxWQYMk,2159839,2165280,okay that's good to know yep another ray  target perhaps another raid target
JqD2OxWQYMk,2165280,2174160,they'd soon become but before we got to  know more about cc jessica we heard heli  while flame raiding a nearby base
JqD2OxWQYMk,2181040,2186040,there he is  he's loaded
JqD2OxWQYMk,2186560,2192320,uh okay  not worth it it's better than it's  better than nothing like
JqD2OxWQYMk,2192320,2199280,helly's out  like coming kind of towards us it's  coming to us  no do we take it yeah hell yeah
JqD2OxWQYMk,2199280,2204078,take it i can go grab the m39 hopefully  get a hit on it
JqD2OxWQYMk,2207760,2211440,little higher a little higher nice
JqD2OxWQYMk,2213040,2219079,oh [ __ ] blue  it's already coming for a rocket run  bruh

JqD2OxWQYMk,2254160,2259359,baltian and ak  okay  it's good but
JqD2OxWQYMk,2259599,2266160,c4 rockets would have been pretty cool  so as you heard heli didn't get us  anything crazy like rockets in c4 but
JqD2OxWQYMk,2266160,2272800,what it did get us was a fresh ak bolty  and l96 today was the day to make plays
JqD2OxWQYMk,2272800,2280720,so we took all of it out on our next  roam  guy 100 by the way
JqD2OxWQYMk,2280720,2287119,and they're all his back might be turned  hit him once  there's a blue hazy at that
JqD2OxWQYMk,2287119,2293838,now it's that one he's dead now  nice nice  oh there's a guy inside
JqD2OxWQYMk,2294800,2298200,behind the tree
JqD2OxWQYMk,2308079,2313760,running up naked  justin that's like it's like a different
JqD2OxWQYMk,2313760,2320400,guy  dude furnaces are loaded can you make  sure he doesn't come up
JqD2OxWQYMk,2320400,2326160,uh yep  i'm pretty far i'm running up it's okay  i'm out
JqD2OxWQYMk,2326160,2333920,cc chicken and justin  um no i see that one
JqD2OxWQYMk,2337440,2342560,oh yeah yeah hit him once  i ran out of ammo
JqD2OxWQYMk,2342560,2348079,might have been running right i see him  he's right here on the road  yeah  once he heads up
JqD2OxWQYMk,2348079,2353400,getting ak okay  i have ak
JqD2OxWQYMk,2354160,2360000,he's not bad right john he's attacked  right charms you loot that guy right  there  yeah it's good
JqD2OxWQYMk,2360000,2365359,the less we saw of the cleanup crew the  more we saw this other group cece and
JqD2OxWQYMk,2365359,2372480,justin it seemed to be just another trio  so motion and i headed back over to  their base to fight them again if we
JqD2OxWQYMk,2372480,2379760,cleared out enough of their kits we  could potentially online raid their base  without much pushback he's outside again
JqD2OxWQYMk,2379760,2385440,hazmat sorry  i missed him  get him
JqD2OxWQYMk,2385440,2391440,white first my top on the roof surely  front door dead  nice
JqD2OxWQYMk,2393680,2396680,mini
JqD2OxWQYMk,2407839,2410839,oh
JqD2OxWQYMk,2412870,2416300,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,2422319,2429359,dead  [Applause]  [Music]  no he ran upstairs and closed everything
JqD2OxWQYMk,2429359,2435040,[ __ ]  you guys scared me bro i accidentally
JqD2OxWQYMk,2435040,2441119,pressed tab yeah [ __ ]  getting that ak would be huge though  i knew he was gonna run in and like
JqD2OxWQYMk,2441119,2446240,close those doors i was trying to like  watch the roof and like headshot him as  he went for it yeah it was too much it's
JqD2OxWQYMk,2446240,2452400,all right  this would definitely be a good raid  yeah for sure just ate the back i'd
JqD2OxWQYMk,2452400,2458079,rather go through doors so they have  nowhere to go you know like this first  door leads to their jump up to the  second floor
JqD2OxWQYMk,2458079,2463839,so we blow the first door and then they  have no access to the front door and  then they're just completely contained  in the two by two you know as we're
JqD2OxWQYMk,2463839,2470240,sending in steamers  should we like head back i mean i don't  think these guys are going to peek  yeah i think they have uh yes we're just
JqD2OxWQYMk,2470240,2476160,trying to take oil i think they're done  saying we're trying to take oil like for  the sixth time this wipe can you please
JqD2OxWQYMk,2476160,2482960,leave  so it was official we were ready to raid  the cleanup crew can wait as far as we
JqD2OxWQYMk,2482960,2489280,could tell they were offline at the time  and with cc's base this easy to hold  down we couldn't just pass it up the
JqD2OxWQYMk,2489280,2494400,plan as we just went over was fairly  straightforward and seemingly fool proof
JqD2OxWQYMk,2494400,2499920,by raiding the front door we cut off  their access to the roof which would  mean that they'd only have one direction
JqD2OxWQYMk,2499920,2506240,to defend from so using all of the scrap  we've been getting throughout the wipe i  tech tree down to rockets and crafted
JqD2OxWQYMk,2506240,2513760,explosives expecting armored doors i  brought as many rockets as we could  craft which was eight this was all or
JqD2OxWQYMk,2513760,2522359,nothing but we had a good feeling about  it  oh my god it didn't shoot takes so long
JqD2OxWQYMk,2529280,2532599,he's in there
JqD2OxWQYMk,2536600,2544240,[Music]  i'm gonna rock it after okay
JqD2OxWQYMk,2545040,2550440,uh don't rock it  yeah oh yeah
JqD2OxWQYMk,2558880,2564200,on the roof i'm dead he's on the roof  peeking peeking

JqD2OxWQYMk,2608400,2613839,but he didn't jump off he was still on  the roof i would have killed him  i'm uh running back over with mp5
JqD2OxWQYMk,2613839,2619680,oh  so reloading it  they just got killed by mp5
JqD2OxWQYMk,2619680,2625599,[Music]  i might have killed mp5 in like three

JqD2OxWQYMk,2695200,2700720,oh my god he killed him again  [Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,2700720,2707839,i'm dead i got so jump scared  [Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,2707839,2714160,so if you are or ever have been a rust  player  you know the feeling you lose the raid
JqD2OxWQYMk,2714160,2721359,and you linger around the area waiting  for a critical mistake from the  defenders it's your last strand of hope
JqD2OxWQYMk,2721359,2726800,but the reality is the raid is a fail  and this situation was no different
JqD2OxWQYMk,2726800,2731920,exactly what we didn't want to happen  and what we even planned to avoid ended
JqD2OxWQYMk,2731920,2739440,up happening one of them decided to go  afk in the roof airlock which got us  flanked and lost this the raid this was
JqD2OxWQYMk,2739440,2744560,a tough pill to swallow but this is also  where the title of this video comes into
JqD2OxWQYMk,2744560,2751680,play what separates a casual from a  dedicated rust player  determination we could have just quit
JqD2OxWQYMk,2751680,2759040,the server after a loss like this with  our tail between our legs but no we  couldn't let this one slide for the next
JqD2OxWQYMk,2759040,2765039,hour we were going to farm and smelt up  enough sulfur to raid them again
JqD2OxWQYMk,2765760,2772319,yeah now now we know it's three rockets  yeah i pretty much already have that on  me oh you found me now yeah
JqD2OxWQYMk,2772319,2777599,i think next time i before i even start  rocking the front door i'm going to go  up and instant the roof
JqD2OxWQYMk,2777599,2783318,just in case some weirdo decides to be  afk up there
JqD2OxWQYMk,2788240,2792800,door camped man looting me now it's  justin
JqD2OxWQYMk,2793680,2799839,just outside the flank base  this doubles nice
JqD2OxWQYMk,2799839,2805920,once when i got the soul for home i  started filling up our small furnaces  and when those were filled i went and
JqD2OxWQYMk,2805920,2812800,farmed more sulfur then i made a large  furnace base and started smelting again  we want their base to be exactly how we
JqD2OxWQYMk,2812800,2818400,left it so the faster we got this done  the less time they'd have to expand
JqD2OxWQYMk,2818400,2823440,with everything finally ready to go it  was time for the redemption raid this
JqD2OxWQYMk,2823440,2827720,time we'd do it right
JqD2OxWQYMk,2830180,2838369,[Music]
JqD2OxWQYMk,2840960,2843359,right
JqD2OxWQYMk,2857599,2863680,is that [ __ ] up  they're dead they're dead nice  i'm going to break this and then get rid
JqD2OxWQYMk,2863680,2866078,of the door
JqD2OxWQYMk,2870319,2872880,put the code
JqD2OxWQYMk,2877760,2884078,nice yeah we got some rockets back oh  the bag here as well oh my god look at  this bag behind you
JqD2OxWQYMk,2884240,2890880,dude have you seen tc no no i'm gonna  replace jc holy  yeah i got it
JqD2OxWQYMk,2890880,2896720,why don't these guys upgrade  [Music]  let's go blue let's go man
JqD2OxWQYMk,2896720,2903690,we [ __ ] did it  we did it right this time baby
JqD2OxWQYMk,2903690,2910640,[Music]  success at last it may have cost us more  rockets than we originally wanted it to
JqD2OxWQYMk,2910640,2916400,but a win is a win and it feels even  sweeter when we lost farmed it back and
JqD2OxWQYMk,2916400,2921839,finished them off despite the extra  rockets used it was still profits we got
JqD2OxWQYMk,2921839,2928240,the rockets back that we didn't use in  the previous attempt as well as a decent  amount of sulfur and gunpowder we sure
JqD2OxWQYMk,2928240,2934559,as hell weren't gonna let this just go  to waste so i think you might know what  we had in mind we still had a score to
JqD2OxWQYMk,2934559,2938240,settle with the cleanup crew
JqD2OxWQYMk,2940800,2947200,yeah they're active they're once outside  right now  is he running away
JqD2OxWQYMk,2947200,2952319,yeah three three no there's a third one  at the base too  okay do we let them go i think we let
JqD2OxWQYMk,2952319,2958640,them go  uh but then they flank us though  true
JqD2OxWQYMk,2960800,2966400,full-on leaving bro  is that the last guy yeah that was the  last guy  i just want to give her like two minutes
JqD2OxWQYMk,2966400,2972720,and we'll start or yeah yeah yeah that's  a good idea  wait one's coming back one's coming back

JqD2OxWQYMk,3063280,3069280,best cleaning up our corpses after we  did all of the work on ourselves we
JqD2OxWQYMk,3069280,3074960,figured this was the end  but then we were given a second chance

JqD2OxWQYMk,3282799,3289040,but this whole ordeal wasn't over yet  motion noticed that the foundation we  were originally trying to blow into was
JqD2OxWQYMk,3289040,3295520,one rocket away from being fully  destroyed we had two rockets left from  looting the counters so of course we
