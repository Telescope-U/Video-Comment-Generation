B28ebjEdMTw,0,1760,a portion of this video is sponsored by
B28ebjEdMTw,1760,3600,google i think we're all familiar with
B28ebjEdMTw,3600,5759,the phrase you eat with your eyes it's a
B28ebjEdMTw,5759,7359,saying that immediately makes me think
B28ebjEdMTw,7359,9679,of an eyeball lined with rows of teeth
B28ebjEdMTw,9679,11360,but then again i make my living playing
B28ebjEdMTw,11360,13759,indie horror games so my perception
B28ebjEdMTw,13759,15599,might be a bit skewed in reality though
B28ebjEdMTw,15599,16880,it's a saying all about how when we're
B28ebjEdMTw,16880,18560,presented with food the first thing that
B28ebjEdMTw,18560,20480,impacts our taste is the visual
B28ebjEdMTw,20480,23039,presentation this looks a lot tastier
B28ebjEdMTw,23039,24720,than this but just because it looks
B28ebjEdMTw,24720,26560,tastier does that necessarily mean that
B28ebjEdMTw,26560,30000,it is tastier well actually a lot today
B28ebjEdMTw,30000,32238,we're looking at how much sight lies to
B28ebjEdMTw,32238,34399,us about the food that we eat with team
B28ebjEdMTw,34399,36000,theorists putting their tongues on the
B28ebjEdMTw,36000,38399,line for you and for science and if
B28ebjEdMTw,38399,40800,sight truly is that important for flavor
B28ebjEdMTw,40800,42480,have you ever considered how people with
B28ebjEdMTw,42480,44480,visual impairments taste the world
B28ebjEdMTw,44480,45840,around them by the end of today's
B28ebjEdMTw,45840,47120,episode you're not going to believe your
B28ebjEdMTw,47120,51000,eyes or mouths
B28ebjEdMTw,54720,62559,[Music]
B28ebjEdMTw,62559,65760,hello internet welcome to food theory
B28ebjEdMTw,65760,68080,the show that tastes as good as it looks
B28ebjEdMTw,68080,69520,previously on food theory we did an
B28ebjEdMTw,69520,71600,episode all about how hearing has a big
B28ebjEdMTw,71600,73280,impact on how fresh we perceive
B28ebjEdMTw,73280,74720,something to be that things that are
B28ebjEdMTw,74720,76799,crunchier or snappier tend to be rated
B28ebjEdMTw,76799,78799,as fresher regardless of whether or not
B28ebjEdMTw,78799,80560,that's true but that episode got me
B28ebjEdMTw,80560,82240,really thinking about our other senses
B28ebjEdMTw,82240,83680,too when someone is told to taste a
B28ebjEdMTw,83680,85280,gross food we tell them to hold their
B28ebjEdMTw,85280,87040,nose because inherently we know that
B28ebjEdMTw,87040,89200,smell and taste are linked and by
B28ebjEdMTw,89200,90960,holding your nose the flavor is gonna be
B28ebjEdMTw,90960,93200,lessened but then what about sight sure
B28ebjEdMTw,93200,95040,we naturally have a preference for food
B28ebjEdMTw,95040,96720,that looks pretty and high-end
B28ebjEdMTw,96720,98400,restaurants often justify their extreme
B28ebjEdMTw,98400,99759,prices by making the food on their
B28ebjEdMTw,99759,101520,plates into small works of art but is
B28ebjEdMTw,101520,103840,that really affecting the flavor all
B28ebjEdMTw,103840,105759,that much can what you see with your
B28ebjEdMTw,105759,108240,eyes actually affect what you're tasting
B28ebjEdMTw,108240,110399,on your tongue we decided to tackle the
B28ebjEdMTw,110399,112240,question in two ways first by doing a
B28ebjEdMTw,112240,114079,blind taste test with the help of team
B28ebjEdMTw,114079,116000,theorists involving some homemade gummy
B28ebjEdMTw,116000,117600,bears i just want you to see this
B28ebjEdMTw,117600,119520,texture okay this
B28ebjEdMTw,119520,121520,gloopy
B28ebjEdMTw,121520,124799,little sleepy globe texture got that
B28ebjEdMTw,124799,127360,giggle jiggle chicka jiggle they're wet
B28ebjEdMTw,127360,130399,they are super duper wet i am lucky to
B28ebjEdMTw,130399,132400,have a team that trusts me enough to eat
B28ebjEdMTw,132400,134720,my sketchy gummy bears listen you work
B28ebjEdMTw,134720,138160,for mr beast you get money you get candy
B28ebjEdMTw,138160,140480,factories premium made chocolate you
B28ebjEdMTw,140480,143040,work for theorists you get boogers you
B28ebjEdMTw,143040,146480,get goop you done got gooped yeah all
B28ebjEdMTw,146480,148640,right i get it i'm not a great cook so
B28ebjEdMTw,148640,150560,that's test number one test number two
B28ebjEdMTw,150560,152080,then is looking at the real life data
B28ebjEdMTw,152080,153840,coming from individuals with visual
B28ebjEdMTw,153840,155840,impairments like congenital blindness
B28ebjEdMTw,155840,158319,how do they taste the world around them
B28ebjEdMTw,158319,160080,and how is their perception of food and
B28ebjEdMTw,160080,162000,flavor different from fully sighted
B28ebjEdMTw,162000,164080,individuals is there a difference
B28ebjEdMTw,164080,166560,spoiler alert there is and it's a big
B28ebjEdMTw,166560,168720,one in fact the results of both these
B28ebjEdMTw,168720,170400,explorations in today's episode will
B28ebjEdMTw,170400,172480,reveal some shocking truths about how
B28ebjEdMTw,172480,174560,sight may actually be preventing you
B28ebjEdMTw,174560,176640,from enjoying your next meal it's just
B28ebjEdMTw,176640,178400,one example of how our senses shape the
B28ebjEdMTw,178400,179920,way that we understand and interact with
B28ebjEdMTw,179920,181519,the world around us which is a big part
B28ebjEdMTw,181519,182720,of why it's important to ensure that
B28ebjEdMTw,182720,184800,those experiences are made accessible to
B28ebjEdMTw,184800,186640,everyone including those with
B28ebjEdMTw,186640,188800,disabilities fortunately technology can
B28ebjEdMTw,188800,190640,do a lot to ensure that everyone has the
B28ebjEdMTw,190640,192400,tools that they need to succeed that's
B28ebjEdMTw,192400,194319,why i'm so excited to announce that my
B28ebjEdMTw,194319,195760,sponsor for this portion of today's
B28ebjEdMTw,195760,198640,episode is google yeah google themselves
B28ebjEdMTw,198640,200400,pretty cool right so as you're well
B28ebjEdMTw,200400,202080,familiar with i've been creating content
B28ebjEdMTw,202080,204239,on youtube for over a decade now i'm the
B28ebjEdMTw,204239,206400,middle aged dad of the platform and for
B28ebjEdMTw,206400,207760,the last 10 years one of the coolest
B28ebjEdMTw,207760,208879,parts of the job has been getting to
B28ebjEdMTw,208879,211040,meet with fans this isn't just a channel
B28ebjEdMTw,211040,212799,and you aren't just viewers this is a
B28ebjEdMTw,212799,215120,community of theorists people united by
B28ebjEdMTw,215120,217440,their shared love of overthinking and a
B28ebjEdMTw,217440,219200,huge part of that means making this
B28ebjEdMTw,219200,220879,channel more accessible so no one ever
B28ebjEdMTw,220879,222879,feels excluded and that commitment
B28ebjEdMTw,222879,224959,translates in both big and small ways in
B28ebjEdMTw,224959,226799,everything that we do stuff like filling
B28ebjEdMTw,226799,228480,out the alternate text on any photo that
B28ebjEdMTw,228480,230319,we upload to social media or writing our
B28ebjEdMTw,230319,231920,scripts in a way so that you never miss
B28ebjEdMTw,231920,233360,out on a joke just because you may have
B28ebjEdMTw,233360,235680,limited vision or are an audio only
B28ebjEdMTw,235680,237840,listener google actually feels the exact
B28ebjEdMTw,237840,239680,same way they like me believe in the
B28ebjEdMTw,239680,241840,importance of accessibility i mean we
B28ebjEdMTw,241840,243760,are living in a digital age after all
B28ebjEdMTw,243760,245200,there's no reason any physical
B28ebjEdMTw,245200,247040,limitation to our body should be holding
B28ebjEdMTw,247040,249120,us back well-designed technology can
B28ebjEdMTw,249120,251599,help everyone accomplish their goals and
B28ebjEdMTw,251599,253599,google has put that motto into practice
B28ebjEdMTw,253599,255599,by creating accessibility tools that
B28ebjEdMTw,255599,257759,everyone can use for example voice
B28ebjEdMTw,257759,259519,access was built from the ground up to
B28ebjEdMTw,259519,260959,help those who might not be able to
B28ebjEdMTw,260959,263120,physically use their phone no one should
B28ebjEdMTw,263120,264720,be deprived of the ability to flip
B28ebjEdMTw,264720,266800,between apps or type texts just because
B28ebjEdMTw,266800,268800,of their physical limitations and google
B28ebjEdMTw,268800,270720,voice access grants that right to
B28ebjEdMTw,270720,272960,everyone by providing a hands-free way
B28ebjEdMTw,272960,274560,to use your phone with a few simple
B28ebjEdMTw,274560,276720,voice commands it's also a tool that can
B28ebjEdMTw,276720,278720,be used by everyone true story you can
B28ebjEdMTw,278720,280960,actually type faster than i can using my
B28ebjEdMTw,280960,282720,fingers it's also great to use while in
B28ebjEdMTw,282720,284960,the kitchen messy hands not a problem it
B28ebjEdMTw,284960,286960,can read or write any email to me when i
B28ebjEdMTw,286960,288720,ask or it can switch to any other app i
B28ebjEdMTw,288720,290639,might need all without having to lift a
B28ebjEdMTw,290639,291840,finger and it's something that you can
B28ebjEdMTw,291840,293120,get started with yourself all you have
B28ebjEdMTw,293120,295520,to do is say hey google voice access
B28ebjEdMTw,295520,297360,there's also voice guidance which was
B28ebjEdMTw,297360,299040,built with blind and low vision
B28ebjEdMTw,299040,300639,pedestrians in mind allowing them to
B28ebjEdMTw,300639,302479,navigate streets confidently even though
B28ebjEdMTw,302479,303919,they might not be able to see the world
B28ebjEdMTw,303919,305759,around them and again even if you have
B28ebjEdMTw,305759,307680,perfect 20 20 vision it's a tool that
B28ebjEdMTw,307680,310000,proves invaluable to anyone having
B28ebjEdMTw,310000,311759,directions read to you in a clear
B28ebjEdMTw,311759,313680,concise way it just beats constantly
B28ebjEdMTw,313680,315039,having to stare at your phone for
B28ebjEdMTw,315039,316639,assistance it's accessibility that
B28ebjEdMTw,316639,319039,improves lives for everyone and i think
B28ebjEdMTw,319039,320720,we've all appreciated the live
B28ebjEdMTw,320720,322160,transcribe feature whether we've
B28ebjEdMTw,322160,324080,realized it or not its primary purpose
B28ebjEdMTw,324080,325919,was for users with hearing impairments
B28ebjEdMTw,325919,327199,so they wouldn't have to miss out on a
B28ebjEdMTw,327199,329280,phone call or one of my video's cringy
B28ebjEdMTw,329280,331039,puns now they could read all of that
B28ebjEdMTw,331039,333039,stuff in real time you could say it's a
B28ebjEdMTw,333039,336160,t-erific tool like i said terrible puns
B28ebjEdMTw,336160,337680,anyway as a feature for everyone i think
B28ebjEdMTw,337680,339520,we're all guilty of watching a video or
B28ebjEdMTw,339520,341600,two with the sound off while working and
B28ebjEdMTw,341600,343120,reading what's being said in the video
B28ebjEdMTw,343120,344720,instead of hearing it well you've got
B28ebjEdMTw,344720,346720,yourself live transcribed to thank for
B28ebjEdMTw,346720,348639,that one in short a more accessible
B28ebjEdMTw,348639,351280,world means a better world for everyone
B28ebjEdMTw,351280,352960,it matters to me and it matters to
B28ebjEdMTw,352960,354639,google so if you want to find out more
B28ebjEdMTw,354639,356319,about everything google is working on to
B28ebjEdMTw,356319,358000,help make this world a more accessible
B28ebjEdMTw,358000,359840,place where everyone can feel like they
B28ebjEdMTw,359840,362560,belong visit belonging dot google or you
B28ebjEdMTw,362560,364240,know the drill by now check out the link
B28ebjEdMTw,364240,366160,right below the video a big thanks to
B28ebjEdMTw,366160,367520,google for all that they're doing to
B28ebjEdMTw,367520,369039,help make this world a more inclusive
B28ebjEdMTw,369039,370560,place and for sponsoring this portion of
B28ebjEdMTw,370560,372319,the video now back to how a lack of
B28ebjEdMTw,372319,374560,sight might just affect your taste dr
B28ebjEdMTw,374560,376479,charles spence professor of experimental
B28ebjEdMTw,376479,378400,psychology at oxford university with the
B28ebjEdMTw,378400,380319,relationship between taste and sight to
B28ebjEdMTw,380319,382400,the test by giving test subjects grape
B28ebjEdMTw,382400,384639,orange apple and lemon beverages in
B28ebjEdMTw,384639,387039,clear glass bottles all of the beverages
B28ebjEdMTw,387039,389039,were clear as well feels kind of like
B28ebjEdMTw,389039,390960,our crystal pepsi episode all over again
B28ebjEdMTw,390960,392479,since there was no coloring to give away
B28ebjEdMTw,392479,393919,the flavor the test subjects actually
B28ebjEdMTw,393919,395840,had to guess based on flavor alone and
B28ebjEdMTw,395840,397600,you know what they did great despite the
B28ebjEdMTw,397600,399440,lack of colors they were highly likely
B28ebjEdMTw,399440,401280,to guess the correct flavor within the
B28ebjEdMTw,401280,403520,drinks but then he mixed it up he added
B28ebjEdMTw,403520,405120,food coloring to mess with people's
B28ebjEdMTw,405120,407039,expectations doing things like making
B28ebjEdMTw,407039,409599,the grape flavored drink orange suddenly
B28ebjEdMTw,409599,411520,people would drink the orange colored
B28ebjEdMTw,411520,413280,beverage and report that it had an
B28ebjEdMTw,413280,415280,orange flavor and here's the craziest
B28ebjEdMTw,415280,417599,part this was true even after people
B28ebjEdMTw,417599,419199,were told that they had been messed with
B28ebjEdMTw,419199,420800,even when people knew that they were
B28ebjEdMTw,420800,422639,supposed to ignore the color it didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,422639,424639,change the fact that simply seeing a
B28ebjEdMTw,424639,426479,yellow liquid in a bottle made them more
B28ebjEdMTw,426479,428240,likely to think that it tasted like
B28ebjEdMTw,428240,430240,lemonade so knowing this i set out to do
B28ebjEdMTw,430240,431680,my own experiment with the help of
B28ebjEdMTw,431680,433840,several members of team theorist dan
B28ebjEdMTw,433840,435759,jerica amy and casey were all brave
B28ebjEdMTw,435759,437599,enough to film themselves on camera the
B28ebjEdMTw,437599,439919,things i do for my job i'm fine i was
B28ebjEdMTw,439919,441520,not forced into doing this at all this
B28ebjEdMTw,441520,443280,is not punishment for forgetting to do
B28ebjEdMTw,443280,445440,something this is totally normal such a
B28ebjEdMTw,445440,447840,normal job we also had a few extra
B28ebjEdMTw,447840,450479,volunteers no you can't have it it's
B28ebjEdMTw,450479,451520,gone
B28ebjEdMTw,451520,453520,the rest chose to remain anonymous for
B28ebjEdMTw,453520,455280,the experiment i created four batches of
B28ebjEdMTw,455280,456800,gummy bears to play with people's sense
B28ebjEdMTw,456800,458800,of taste they are gummies formerly known
B28ebjEdMTw,458800,460639,as bears because as you can see they are
B28ebjEdMTw,460639,463039,no longer a bear they are a blob they're
B28ebjEdMTw,463039,465440,a little melty because it's hot i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,465440,467520,trying to hide my other
B28ebjEdMTw,467520,470160,disgust at basically what feels like
B28ebjEdMTw,470160,472720,eating little bundles of
B28ebjEdMTw,472720,474479,snot all right so some of them may have
B28ebjEdMTw,474479,476720,gotten a little bit malformed on root
B28ebjEdMTw,476720,478000,california some are gonna do what
B28ebjEdMTw,478000,479919,california some are gonna do anyway the
B28ebjEdMTw,479919,482319,four categories were as follows one
B28ebjEdMTw,482319,484240,clear gummies two gummies that were
B28ebjEdMTw,484240,486080,colored to match their flavor three
B28ebjEdMTw,486080,488080,gummies that were colored to not match
B28ebjEdMTw,488080,490639,their flavor it's food theory hard mode
B28ebjEdMTw,490639,492319,and four a regular batch to eat
B28ebjEdMTw,492319,494639,blindfolded or using whatever eye
B28ebjEdMTw,494639,496240,shielding device they had in their
B28ebjEdMTw,496240,498400,vicinity apparently hello and welcome to
B28ebjEdMTw,498400,500080,we didn't have a blindfold in this house
B28ebjEdMTw,500080,502080,so this is gonna have to do high tech
B28ebjEdMTw,502080,504479,blindfold also side note man buns and
B28ebjEdMTw,504479,507039,head straps do not mix for each batch i
B28ebjEdMTw,507039,508960,cook the same five flavors it's also
B28ebjEdMTw,508960,510319,worth noting that i made sure that there
B28ebjEdMTw,510319,512560,was no smell for any of these guys since
B28ebjEdMTw,512560,514560,again smell can drastically affect your
B28ebjEdMTw,514560,516399,flavor perception from there i got our
B28ebjEdMTw,516399,518000,subjects to eat them and report for me
B28ebjEdMTw,518000,519599,whatever flavors they were tasting
B28ebjEdMTw,519599,521599,things that are usually creamy but
B28ebjEdMTw,521599,523440,paired with strawberries i'm gonna go
B28ebjEdMTw,523440,525600,with pear like i like how you can pair
B28ebjEdMTw,525600,528480,your mouse with the subscribe button
B28ebjEdMTw,528480,530240,that shameless plug is not gonna get you
B28ebjEdMTw,530240,532320,a bonus dan
B28ebjEdMTw,532320,535839,oh i heard it i heard i mean i didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,535839,537360,necessarily say that all the flavors
B28ebjEdMTw,537360,539839,were going to be good
B28ebjEdMTw,539839,542399,what was that and the team in true
B28ebjEdMTw,542399,544240,theorist form are doing their best to
B28ebjEdMTw,544240,546720,try and out-think me and the test are we
B28ebjEdMTw,546720,548320,thinking that they have to be fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,548320,550399,because generally candies are flavored
B28ebjEdMTw,550399,552399,as fruit in our breakfast when they're
B28ebjEdMTw,552399,554080,chocolate except when they're chocolate
B28ebjEdMTw,554080,556000,but are we predisposed in our brains to
B28ebjEdMTw,556000,557920,just kind of think that they're fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,557920,561360,flavors and not like grass yeah and so
B28ebjEdMTw,561360,562720,that's why i'm wondering if they're like
B28ebjEdMTw,562720,565440,if they're trying to trick us into
B28ebjEdMTw,565440,567839,thinking that they are going to be fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,567839,569600,flavored and then it ends up being
B28ebjEdMTw,569600,572080,something actually cheesecake flavored
B28ebjEdMTw,572080,575200,candle wax something that's not normal
B28ebjEdMTw,575200,577200,flavors it's moments like that that make
B28ebjEdMTw,577200,579120,me so proud of them anyway once they
B28ebjEdMTw,579120,580640,were done guessing i provided them an
B28ebjEdMTw,580640,584800,answer key to reveal the true flavors
B28ebjEdMTw,585000,587360,[Music]
B28ebjEdMTw,587360,591680,we were so wrong on so many levels the
B28ebjEdMTw,591680,593680,first major surprise came with the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,593680,595600,gummies i figured that clear gummies and
B28ebjEdMTw,595600,597519,the blindfolded test gummies would be
B28ebjEdMTw,597519,599279,pretty similar in result after all it's
B28ebjEdMTw,599279,601279,basically the same thing no colors to
B28ebjEdMTw,601279,603519,either give you a hint or mislead you
B28ebjEdMTw,603519,606320,but boy was i wrong it turns out that
B28ebjEdMTw,606320,608800,seeing clear is actually a lot different
B28ebjEdMTw,608800,610560,from seeing nothing when wearing a
B28ebjEdMTw,610560,612640,blindfold everyone was able to reliably
B28ebjEdMTw,612640,614399,pick out the correct flavors but when
B28ebjEdMTw,614399,616480,confronted with clear gummies something
B28ebjEdMTw,616480,618079,about the color just made the taste
B28ebjEdMTw,618079,619760,experience different here's how the
B28ebjEdMTw,619760,621440,testers reacted when eating a clear
B28ebjEdMTw,621440,623519,gummy with a citrus fruit flavor is it
B28ebjEdMTw,623519,626320,water is the taste of water water with
B28ebjEdMTw,626320,628160,like a teaspoon of sugar it tasted
B28ebjEdMTw,628160,630000,mostly just kind of like
B28ebjEdMTw,630000,631760,liquid everyone reported that the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,631760,633760,gummy tasted like nothing and mind you
B28ebjEdMTw,633760,635440,this is entirely due to the gummy's
B28ebjEdMTw,635440,636640,appearance unless you think it's
B28ebjEdMTw,636640,638240,something off about the flavor here was
B28ebjEdMTw,638240,639920,their reaction later in the test when
B28ebjEdMTw,639920,642079,they were given the exact same flavor of
B28ebjEdMTw,642079,644560,gummy but with red food coloring added
B28ebjEdMTw,644560,646959,blueberry i get strawberry big
B28ebjEdMTw,646959,648800,strawberry vinyl like orange fanta i
B28ebjEdMTw,648800,651440,hope this is uh helpful more helpful
B28ebjEdMTw,651440,653680,than you could imagine head editor dan
B28ebjEdMTw,653680,655279,the clear gummy put people in the
B28ebjEdMTw,655279,657920,mindset of water or a lack of flavor and
B28ebjEdMTw,657920,659680,that's exactly what they perceived
B28ebjEdMTw,659680,661839,something tasteless whereas with a red
B28ebjEdMTw,661839,663440,gummy suddenly they were getting hints
B28ebjEdMTw,663440,665279,of fruit with both casey and dan making
B28ebjEdMTw,665279,667120,incorrect choices of strawberry and
B28ebjEdMTw,667120,669440,watermelon classically red fruits to go
B28ebjEdMTw,669440,671680,along with the red coloring only jericho
B28ebjEdMTw,671680,673600,was able to correctly identify a tart
B28ebjEdMTw,673600,675600,citrus fruit to match the flavor that we
B28ebjEdMTw,675600,677360,had put in i was prepared for the
B28ebjEdMTw,677360,679360,possibility that misleading colors might
B28ebjEdMTw,679360,681040,throw people off but it hadn't even
B28ebjEdMTw,681040,682959,occurred to me that clear could do the
B28ebjEdMTw,682959,684800,same thing but it turned out that this
B28ebjEdMTw,684800,687360,was true for almost all of the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,687360,690160,gummies we were wrong we're so so wrong
B28ebjEdMTw,690160,692000,and when it did come to those mismatched
B28ebjEdMTw,692000,693920,flavor to color gummies the red herring
B28ebjEdMTw,693920,695920,effect was on full display one of our
B28ebjEdMTw,695920,697760,gummies was pineapple and when it was
B28ebjEdMTw,697760,700240,colored yellow people nailed it
B28ebjEdMTw,700240,704720,pineapple banana i got more like
B28ebjEdMTw,704720,706640,pineappley but when that same flavor was
B28ebjEdMTw,706640,708880,presented as a blue gummy haha the
B28ebjEdMTw,708880,711279,responses changed a lot i'm ready i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,711279,714800,ready okay what do you got i say like a
B28ebjEdMTw,714800,717200,sort of mouthwash again i got mouthwash
B28ebjEdMTw,717200,720160,too it started as like blueberry
B28ebjEdMTw,720160,722079,again all that changed here was the
B28ebjEdMTw,722079,723920,color everyone seemed to have the fix on
B28ebjEdMTw,723920,725519,pineapple when it was yellow but by
B28ebjEdMTw,725519,727279,simply taking the pineapple flavor and
B28ebjEdMTw,727279,728880,coloring it blue suddenly people's
B28ebjEdMTw,728880,730639,reactions tended toward things that you
B28ebjEdMTw,730639,732959,would associate with blue blueberry blue
B28ebjEdMTw,732959,735519,raspberry and of course mouthwash which
B28ebjEdMTw,735519,737040,i should mention was not one of the
B28ebjEdMTw,737040,739440,flavors included i would never
B28ebjEdMTw,739440,741440,fudge science
B28ebjEdMTw,741440,744480,but i would much rather be eating fudge
B28ebjEdMTw,744480,747360,than any of these i'm glad i didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,747360,749920,fudge it up
B28ebjEdMTw,750079,751600,those were some of the notable examples
B28ebjEdMTw,751600,752720,that i wanted to pick out but the
B28ebjEdMTw,752720,754720,overall data showed the exact same trend
B28ebjEdMTw,754720,756639,people were at their most accurate when
B28ebjEdMTw,756639,758399,given colored gummies whose color was
B28ebjEdMTw,758399,760240,chosen to match the flavor and they did
B28ebjEdMTw,760240,762320,almost as well when blindfolded but when
B28ebjEdMTw,762320,764560,the gummies became clear accuracy
B28ebjEdMTw,764560,766079,dropped considerably and when the
B28ebjEdMTw,766079,768079,gummies were misleadingly colored it led
B28ebjEdMTw,768079,770560,people to all sorts of wild conclusions
B28ebjEdMTw,770560,773680,in total zero percent of those responses
B28ebjEdMTw,773680,775440,wound up being right are you saying i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,775440,777760,flavor blind no i'm saying that
B28ebjEdMTw,777760,780000,everything in the world is a lie
B28ebjEdMTw,780000,782240,and nothing is real it's all a
B28ebjEdMTw,782240,783760,simulation
B28ebjEdMTw,783760,785440,this is a simulation within the
B28ebjEdMTw,785440,787519,simulation still all of this research to
B28ebjEdMTw,787519,789360,me felt incomplete because it was all
B28ebjEdMTw,789360,790959,coming from the premise that we have
B28ebjEdMTw,790959,792959,expectations about what food is supposed
B28ebjEdMTw,792959,794800,to look like but all of that is based on
B28ebjEdMTw,794800,796320,the assumption that we were able to form
B28ebjEdMTw,796320,798399,those visual expectations in the first
B28ebjEdMTw,798399,800160,place what happens when you do a blind
B28ebjEdMTw,800160,802079,taste test not with sighted people who
B28ebjEdMTw,802079,803920,are blindfolded but with people with
B28ebjEdMTw,803920,806000,congenital blindness the people who have
B28ebjEdMTw,806000,808480,been blind since birth researchers at
B28ebjEdMTw,808480,810160,the university of montreal school of
B28ebjEdMTw,810160,812560,optometry did a study looking at exactly
B28ebjEdMTw,812560,814240,this testing how vision affects the way
B28ebjEdMTw,814240,816399,that we eat and taste food they came
B28ebjEdMTw,816399,818079,back with results that range from the
B28ebjEdMTw,818079,820800,expected to the absolutely shocking
B28ebjEdMTw,820800,822399,first off one thing they discovered is
B28ebjEdMTw,822399,824079,that sighted people tend to respond to
B28ebjEdMTw,824079,826560,external context to decide when and what
B28ebjEdMTw,826560,828160,to eat turns out that all that
B28ebjEdMTw,828160,830720,image-based advertising works on us for
B28ebjEdMTw,830720,832880,sighted people simply seeing food can
B28ebjEdMTw,832880,835040,put us in the mood to eat regardless of
B28ebjEdMTw,835040,837040,how hungry we might actually be people
B28ebjEdMTw,837040,838560,with congenital blindness on the other
B28ebjEdMTw,838560,840320,hand were more likely to rely on
B28ebjEdMTw,840320,842720,internal hunger and satiety clues in
B28ebjEdMTw,842720,843839,other words they were doing the
B28ebjEdMTw,843839,845839,impossible they were basing their meal
B28ebjEdMTw,845839,848240,times on when they were actually hungry
B28ebjEdMTw,848240,849600,it turns out that the method preferred
B28ebjEdMTw,849600,851760,by blind individuals is actually a lot
B28ebjEdMTw,851760,853760,better for their health too in fact
B28ebjEdMTw,853760,855120,sighted people are more prone to
B28ebjEdMTw,855120,857279,maladaptive eating which leads to eating
B28ebjEdMTw,857279,859440,disorders in other words all those
B28ebjEdMTw,859440,861600,external cues that sighted people so
B28ebjEdMTw,861600,864480,often respond to like food ads work in
B28ebjEdMTw,864480,866480,both directions by making us eat when
B28ebjEdMTw,866480,868959,we're not hungry but also by making us
B28ebjEdMTw,868959,870959,not eat when we should be it would seem
B28ebjEdMTw,870959,873120,like eating too many snacks and skipping
B28ebjEdMTw,873120,874880,meals would be opposite problems but
B28ebjEdMTw,874880,876639,they actually both stem from the same
B28ebjEdMTw,876639,878639,fundamental problem which is looking at
B28ebjEdMTw,878639,880560,the external environment and letting the
B28ebjEdMTw,880560,882639,things we see including television ads
B28ebjEdMTw,882639,885040,and social media posts dictate what and
B28ebjEdMTw,885040,886880,when we eat rather than listening to our
B28ebjEdMTw,886880,888639,own body and letting those internal
B28ebjEdMTw,888639,890560,hunger cues decide when meal time should
B28ebjEdMTw,890560,891920,be but that wasn't even the most
B28ebjEdMTw,891920,893839,interesting part one of their hypotheses
B28ebjEdMTw,893839,895120,was that people with congenital
B28ebjEdMTw,895120,896880,blindness would have a sharper sense of
B28ebjEdMTw,896880,898560,taste after all the conventional wisdom
B28ebjEdMTw,898560,900480,is that the less you rely on your vision
B28ebjEdMTw,900480,902240,the more you have to rely on other
B28ebjEdMTw,902240,904399,senses and research has shown that blind
B28ebjEdMTw,904399,906399,individuals have a more nuanced sense of
B28ebjEdMTw,906399,908320,hearing and touch so the researchers
B28ebjEdMTw,908320,910320,thought the same would probably be true
B28ebjEdMTw,910320,912560,for taste as well but in fact it turned
B28ebjEdMTw,912560,914399,out to be the opposite their preliminary
B28ebjEdMTw,914399,916160,data suggested that blind people had a
B28ebjEdMTw,916160,917680,harder time when it came to tests
B28ebjEdMTw,917680,919120,involving taste detection and
B28ebjEdMTw,919120,921440,identification so what gives is this yet
B28ebjEdMTw,921440,923199,another case of sight affecting what we
B28ebjEdMTw,923199,925440,taste or was something else going on the
B28ebjEdMTw,925440,927120,researchers wanted to understand why
B28ebjEdMTw,927120,929120,this discrepancy existed in the data and
B28ebjEdMTw,929120,930560,they found that the blind individuals
B28ebjEdMTw,930560,932959,they studied had under-exposed taste
B28ebjEdMTw,932959,935040,systems in other words blind people had
B28ebjEdMTw,935040,937120,less variety in their diet and having a
B28ebjEdMTw,937120,938800,narrower palate made it harder for them
B28ebjEdMTw,938800,940560,to identify certain flavors now of
B28ebjEdMTw,940560,942320,course this answer wasn't that much of
B28ebjEdMTw,942320,944160,an answer just left the researchers with
B28ebjEdMTw,944160,946160,a different question why the blind
B28ebjEdMTw,946160,947920,individuals they talked to had less
B28ebjEdMTw,947920,949759,variety in their food diets one of the
B28ebjEdMTw,949759,951120,things they considered was food
B28ebjEdMTw,951120,953680,neophobia that is the fear of trying new
B28ebjEdMTw,953680,955360,foods the researchers originally
B28ebjEdMTw,955360,957199,hypothesized that blind individuals
B28ebjEdMTw,957199,959279,would score higher on this test and that
B28ebjEdMTw,959279,962480,hypothesis turned out to be 100
B28ebjEdMTw,962480,964639,wrong instead in defiance of their
B28ebjEdMTw,964639,966399,expectations the researchers found there
B28ebjEdMTw,966399,968399,was no difference between sighted people
B28ebjEdMTw,968399,969839,and people with congenital blindness
B28ebjEdMTw,969839,971120,when it came to how willing they were to
B28ebjEdMTw,971120,973040,try new foods the more they dug into the
B28ebjEdMTw,973040,974399,results the more it became clear what
B28ebjEdMTw,974399,976480,the real story here was the fact that
B28ebjEdMTw,976480,978240,blind individuals had less variety in
B28ebjEdMTw,978240,980000,their diet had nothing to do with their
B28ebjEdMTw,980000,982079,preferences and it had everything to do
B28ebjEdMTw,982079,983920,with what researchers described as
B28ebjEdMTw,983920,985759,blindness related obstacles when
B28ebjEdMTw,985759,988160,shopping for food cooking and eating out
B28ebjEdMTw,988160,990320,it's not that blind people didn't want
B28ebjEdMTw,990320,992399,to try new food it was that grocery
B28ebjEdMTw,992399,994000,stores and restaurants made it harder
B28ebjEdMTw,994000,995839,for them to try new foods by not
B28ebjEdMTw,995839,997600,accommodating their disability when a
B28ebjEdMTw,997600,999120,restaurant doesn't offer menus in
B28ebjEdMTw,999120,1000880,braille it's a lot easier to just say
B28ebjEdMTw,1000880,1002560,i'll take a hamburger or some other
B28ebjEdMTw,1002560,1004079,familiar food that you know is going to
B28ebjEdMTw,1004079,1005680,be on the menu by the way restaurant
B28ebjEdMTw,1005680,1006959,owners if you're looking for a way to
B28ebjEdMTw,1006959,1008720,get more business and make the world a
B28ebjEdMTw,1008720,1010720,more inclusive place to san seemingly
B28ebjEdMTw,1010720,1012560,small things can make a big difference
B28ebjEdMTw,1012560,1014240,when it comes to accessibility the good
B28ebjEdMTw,1014240,1015759,news is that's something we can take
B28ebjEdMTw,1015759,1017680,steps towards improving changing the
B28ebjEdMTw,1017680,1019279,world so it's more inclusive for
B28ebjEdMTw,1019279,1021120,everyone in the end though when it comes
B28ebjEdMTw,1021120,1023600,to taste sight matters sight can mislead
B28ebjEdMTw,1023600,1025520,us sight can make us hungry so it can
B28ebjEdMTw,1025520,1027600,make us skip meals it can make us taste
B28ebjEdMTw,1027600,1029600,things that aren't there and mistaste
B28ebjEdMTw,1029600,1031678,things that are there in many ways the
B28ebjEdMTw,1031678,1034558,ability to see is actually hampering our
B28ebjEdMTw,1034558,1037038,ability to truly taste so the next time
B28ebjEdMTw,1037038,1038880,you sit down to a meal try to eat with
B28ebjEdMTw,1038880,1041438,your mouth first instead of your eyes
B28ebjEdMTw,1041438,1043678,because the truth is always a little bit
B28ebjEdMTw,1043678,1046400,sweeter and remember it's all just a
B28ebjEdMTw,1046400,1050480,theory a food theory bon appetit well
B28ebjEdMTw,1050480,1053230,there you go science at its finest
B28ebjEdMTw,1053230,1055039,[Music]
B28ebjEdMTw,1055039,1058160,science tastes squishy science tastes
B28ebjEdMTw,1058160,1059760,squishy and hey if you want to see me do
B28ebjEdMTw,1059760,1061679,a blindfolded taste test of my own check
B28ebjEdMTw,1061679,1063600,out this video where i try to prove that
B28ebjEdMTw,1063600,1065440,different breakfast cereals are actually
B28ebjEdMTw,1065440,1067600,the same product with different colors
B28ebjEdMTw,1067600,1069440,or check out this video to watch team
B28ebjEdMTw,1069440,1071840,theorists endure another sweet tasting
B28ebjEdMTw,1071840,1073280,test where they have to lick their way
B28ebjEdMTw,1073280,1075760,to the chewy center of a hard candy pop
B28ebjEdMTw,1075760,1076880,what's the weirdest thing you've had to
B28ebjEdMTw,1076880,1079679,do for my job
B28ebjEdMTw,1079679,1082160,i mean i don't know would it be
B28ebjEdMTw,1082160,1083520,caressing
B28ebjEdMTw,1083520,1085360,aggressively oh tootsie pop with my

B28ebjEdMTw,0,1760,a portion of this video is sponsored by
B28ebjEdMTw,1760,3600,google i think we're all familiar with
B28ebjEdMTw,3600,5759,the phrase you eat with your eyes it's a
B28ebjEdMTw,5759,7359,saying that immediately makes me think
B28ebjEdMTw,7359,9679,of an eyeball lined with rows of teeth
B28ebjEdMTw,9679,11360,but then again i make my living playing
B28ebjEdMTw,11360,13759,indie horror games so my perception
B28ebjEdMTw,13759,15599,might be a bit skewed in reality though
B28ebjEdMTw,15599,16880,it's a saying all about how when we're
B28ebjEdMTw,16880,18560,presented with food the first thing that
B28ebjEdMTw,18560,20480,impacts our taste is the visual
B28ebjEdMTw,20480,23039,presentation this looks a lot tastier
B28ebjEdMTw,23039,24720,than this but just because it looks
B28ebjEdMTw,24720,26560,tastier does that necessarily mean that
B28ebjEdMTw,26560,30000,it is tastier well actually a lot today
B28ebjEdMTw,30000,32238,we're looking at how much sight lies to
B28ebjEdMTw,32238,34399,us about the food that we eat with team
B28ebjEdMTw,34399,36000,theorists putting their tongues on the
B28ebjEdMTw,36000,38399,line for you and for science and if
B28ebjEdMTw,38399,40800,sight truly is that important for flavor
B28ebjEdMTw,40800,42480,have you ever considered how people with
B28ebjEdMTw,42480,44480,visual impairments taste the world
B28ebjEdMTw,44480,45840,around them by the end of today's
B28ebjEdMTw,45840,47120,episode you're not going to believe your
B28ebjEdMTw,47120,51000,eyes or mouths
B28ebjEdMTw,54720,62559,[Music]
B28ebjEdMTw,62559,65760,hello internet welcome to food theory
B28ebjEdMTw,65760,68080,the show that tastes as good as it looks
B28ebjEdMTw,68080,69520,previously on food theory we did an
B28ebjEdMTw,69520,71600,episode all about how hearing has a big
B28ebjEdMTw,71600,73280,impact on how fresh we perceive
B28ebjEdMTw,73280,74720,something to be that things that are
B28ebjEdMTw,74720,76799,crunchier or snappier tend to be rated
B28ebjEdMTw,76799,78799,as fresher regardless of whether or not
B28ebjEdMTw,78799,80560,that's true but that episode got me
B28ebjEdMTw,80560,82240,really thinking about our other senses
B28ebjEdMTw,82240,83680,too when someone is told to taste a
B28ebjEdMTw,83680,85280,gross food we tell them to hold their
B28ebjEdMTw,85280,87040,nose because inherently we know that
B28ebjEdMTw,87040,89200,smell and taste are linked and by
B28ebjEdMTw,89200,90960,holding your nose the flavor is gonna be
B28ebjEdMTw,90960,93200,lessened but then what about sight sure
B28ebjEdMTw,93200,95040,we naturally have a preference for food
B28ebjEdMTw,95040,96720,that looks pretty and high-end
B28ebjEdMTw,96720,98400,restaurants often justify their extreme
B28ebjEdMTw,98400,99759,prices by making the food on their
B28ebjEdMTw,99759,101520,plates into small works of art but is
B28ebjEdMTw,101520,103840,that really affecting the flavor all
B28ebjEdMTw,103840,105759,that much can what you see with your
B28ebjEdMTw,105759,108240,eyes actually affect what you're tasting
B28ebjEdMTw,108240,110399,on your tongue we decided to tackle the
B28ebjEdMTw,110399,112240,question in two ways first by doing a
B28ebjEdMTw,112240,114079,blind taste test with the help of team
B28ebjEdMTw,114079,116000,theorists involving some homemade gummy
B28ebjEdMTw,116000,117600,bears i just want you to see this
B28ebjEdMTw,117600,119520,texture okay this
B28ebjEdMTw,119520,121520,gloopy
B28ebjEdMTw,121520,124799,little sleepy globe texture got that
B28ebjEdMTw,124799,127360,giggle jiggle chicka jiggle they're wet
B28ebjEdMTw,127360,130399,they are super duper wet i am lucky to
B28ebjEdMTw,130399,132400,have a team that trusts me enough to eat
B28ebjEdMTw,132400,134720,my sketchy gummy bears listen you work
B28ebjEdMTw,134720,138160,for mr beast you get money you get candy
B28ebjEdMTw,138160,140480,factories premium made chocolate you
B28ebjEdMTw,140480,143040,work for theorists you get boogers you
B28ebjEdMTw,143040,146480,get goop you done got gooped yeah all
B28ebjEdMTw,146480,148640,right i get it i'm not a great cook so
B28ebjEdMTw,148640,150560,that's test number one test number two
B28ebjEdMTw,150560,152080,then is looking at the real life data
B28ebjEdMTw,152080,153840,coming from individuals with visual
B28ebjEdMTw,153840,155840,impairments like congenital blindness
B28ebjEdMTw,155840,158319,how do they taste the world around them
B28ebjEdMTw,158319,160080,and how is their perception of food and
B28ebjEdMTw,160080,162000,flavor different from fully sighted
B28ebjEdMTw,162000,164080,individuals is there a difference
B28ebjEdMTw,164080,166560,spoiler alert there is and it's a big
B28ebjEdMTw,166560,168720,one in fact the results of both these
B28ebjEdMTw,168720,170400,explorations in today's episode will
B28ebjEdMTw,170400,172480,reveal some shocking truths about how
B28ebjEdMTw,172480,174560,sight may actually be preventing you
B28ebjEdMTw,174560,176640,from enjoying your next meal it's just
B28ebjEdMTw,176640,178400,one example of how our senses shape the
B28ebjEdMTw,178400,179920,way that we understand and interact with
B28ebjEdMTw,179920,181519,the world around us which is a big part
B28ebjEdMTw,181519,182720,of why it's important to ensure that
B28ebjEdMTw,182720,184800,those experiences are made accessible to
B28ebjEdMTw,184800,186640,everyone including those with
B28ebjEdMTw,186640,188800,disabilities fortunately technology can
B28ebjEdMTw,188800,190640,do a lot to ensure that everyone has the
B28ebjEdMTw,190640,192400,tools that they need to succeed that's
B28ebjEdMTw,192400,194319,why i'm so excited to announce that my
B28ebjEdMTw,194319,195760,sponsor for this portion of today's
B28ebjEdMTw,195760,198640,episode is google yeah google themselves
B28ebjEdMTw,198640,200400,pretty cool right so as you're well
B28ebjEdMTw,200400,202080,familiar with i've been creating content
B28ebjEdMTw,202080,204239,on youtube for over a decade now i'm the
B28ebjEdMTw,204239,206400,middle aged dad of the platform and for
B28ebjEdMTw,206400,207760,the last 10 years one of the coolest
B28ebjEdMTw,207760,208879,parts of the job has been getting to
B28ebjEdMTw,208879,211040,meet with fans this isn't just a channel
B28ebjEdMTw,211040,212799,and you aren't just viewers this is a
B28ebjEdMTw,212799,215120,community of theorists people united by
B28ebjEdMTw,215120,217440,their shared love of overthinking and a
B28ebjEdMTw,217440,219200,huge part of that means making this
B28ebjEdMTw,219200,220879,channel more accessible so no one ever
B28ebjEdMTw,220879,222879,feels excluded and that commitment
B28ebjEdMTw,222879,224959,translates in both big and small ways in
B28ebjEdMTw,224959,226799,everything that we do stuff like filling
B28ebjEdMTw,226799,228480,out the alternate text on any photo that
B28ebjEdMTw,228480,230319,we upload to social media or writing our
B28ebjEdMTw,230319,231920,scripts in a way so that you never miss
B28ebjEdMTw,231920,233360,out on a joke just because you may have
B28ebjEdMTw,233360,235680,limited vision or are an audio only
B28ebjEdMTw,235680,237840,listener google actually feels the exact
B28ebjEdMTw,237840,239680,same way they like me believe in the
B28ebjEdMTw,239680,241840,importance of accessibility i mean we
B28ebjEdMTw,241840,243760,are living in a digital age after all
B28ebjEdMTw,243760,245200,there's no reason any physical
B28ebjEdMTw,245200,247040,limitation to our body should be holding
B28ebjEdMTw,247040,249120,us back well-designed technology can
B28ebjEdMTw,249120,251599,help everyone accomplish their goals and
B28ebjEdMTw,251599,253599,google has put that motto into practice
B28ebjEdMTw,253599,255599,by creating accessibility tools that
B28ebjEdMTw,255599,257759,everyone can use for example voice
B28ebjEdMTw,257759,259519,access was built from the ground up to
B28ebjEdMTw,259519,260959,help those who might not be able to
B28ebjEdMTw,260959,263120,physically use their phone no one should
B28ebjEdMTw,263120,264720,be deprived of the ability to flip
B28ebjEdMTw,264720,266800,between apps or type texts just because
B28ebjEdMTw,266800,268800,of their physical limitations and google
B28ebjEdMTw,268800,270720,voice access grants that right to
B28ebjEdMTw,270720,272960,everyone by providing a hands-free way
B28ebjEdMTw,272960,274560,to use your phone with a few simple
B28ebjEdMTw,274560,276720,voice commands it's also a tool that can
B28ebjEdMTw,276720,278720,be used by everyone true story you can
B28ebjEdMTw,278720,280960,actually type faster than i can using my
B28ebjEdMTw,280960,282720,fingers it's also great to use while in
B28ebjEdMTw,282720,284960,the kitchen messy hands not a problem it
B28ebjEdMTw,284960,286960,can read or write any email to me when i
B28ebjEdMTw,286960,288720,ask or it can switch to any other app i
B28ebjEdMTw,288720,290639,might need all without having to lift a
B28ebjEdMTw,290639,291840,finger and it's something that you can
B28ebjEdMTw,291840,293120,get started with yourself all you have
B28ebjEdMTw,293120,295520,to do is say hey google voice access
B28ebjEdMTw,295520,297360,there's also voice guidance which was
B28ebjEdMTw,297360,299040,built with blind and low vision
B28ebjEdMTw,299040,300639,pedestrians in mind allowing them to
B28ebjEdMTw,300639,302479,navigate streets confidently even though
B28ebjEdMTw,302479,303919,they might not be able to see the world
B28ebjEdMTw,303919,305759,around them and again even if you have
B28ebjEdMTw,305759,307680,perfect 20 20 vision it's a tool that
B28ebjEdMTw,307680,310000,proves invaluable to anyone having
B28ebjEdMTw,310000,311759,directions read to you in a clear
B28ebjEdMTw,311759,313680,concise way it just beats constantly
B28ebjEdMTw,313680,315039,having to stare at your phone for
B28ebjEdMTw,315039,316639,assistance it's accessibility that
B28ebjEdMTw,316639,319039,improves lives for everyone and i think
B28ebjEdMTw,319039,320720,we've all appreciated the live
B28ebjEdMTw,320720,322160,transcribe feature whether we've
B28ebjEdMTw,322160,324080,realized it or not its primary purpose
B28ebjEdMTw,324080,325919,was for users with hearing impairments
B28ebjEdMTw,325919,327199,so they wouldn't have to miss out on a
B28ebjEdMTw,327199,329280,phone call or one of my video's cringy
B28ebjEdMTw,329280,331039,puns now they could read all of that
B28ebjEdMTw,331039,333039,stuff in real time you could say it's a
B28ebjEdMTw,333039,336160,t-erific tool like i said terrible puns
B28ebjEdMTw,336160,337680,anyway as a feature for everyone i think
B28ebjEdMTw,337680,339520,we're all guilty of watching a video or
B28ebjEdMTw,339520,341600,two with the sound off while working and
B28ebjEdMTw,341600,343120,reading what's being said in the video
B28ebjEdMTw,343120,344720,instead of hearing it well you've got
B28ebjEdMTw,344720,346720,yourself live transcribed to thank for
B28ebjEdMTw,346720,348639,that one in short a more accessible
B28ebjEdMTw,348639,351280,world means a better world for everyone
B28ebjEdMTw,351280,352960,it matters to me and it matters to
B28ebjEdMTw,352960,354639,google so if you want to find out more
B28ebjEdMTw,354639,356319,about everything google is working on to
B28ebjEdMTw,356319,358000,help make this world a more accessible
B28ebjEdMTw,358000,359840,place where everyone can feel like they
B28ebjEdMTw,359840,362560,belong visit belonging dot google or you
B28ebjEdMTw,362560,364240,know the drill by now check out the link
B28ebjEdMTw,364240,366160,right below the video a big thanks to
B28ebjEdMTw,366160,367520,google for all that they're doing to
B28ebjEdMTw,367520,369039,help make this world a more inclusive
B28ebjEdMTw,369039,370560,place and for sponsoring this portion of
B28ebjEdMTw,370560,372319,the video now back to how a lack of
B28ebjEdMTw,372319,374560,sight might just affect your taste dr
B28ebjEdMTw,374560,376479,charles spence professor of experimental
B28ebjEdMTw,376479,378400,psychology at oxford university with the
B28ebjEdMTw,378400,380319,relationship between taste and sight to
B28ebjEdMTw,380319,382400,the test by giving test subjects grape
B28ebjEdMTw,382400,384639,orange apple and lemon beverages in
B28ebjEdMTw,384639,387039,clear glass bottles all of the beverages
B28ebjEdMTw,387039,389039,were clear as well feels kind of like
B28ebjEdMTw,389039,390960,our crystal pepsi episode all over again
B28ebjEdMTw,390960,392479,since there was no coloring to give away
B28ebjEdMTw,392479,393919,the flavor the test subjects actually
B28ebjEdMTw,393919,395840,had to guess based on flavor alone and
B28ebjEdMTw,395840,397600,you know what they did great despite the
B28ebjEdMTw,397600,399440,lack of colors they were highly likely
B28ebjEdMTw,399440,401280,to guess the correct flavor within the
B28ebjEdMTw,401280,403520,drinks but then he mixed it up he added
B28ebjEdMTw,403520,405120,food coloring to mess with people's
B28ebjEdMTw,405120,407039,expectations doing things like making
B28ebjEdMTw,407039,409599,the grape flavored drink orange suddenly
B28ebjEdMTw,409599,411520,people would drink the orange colored
B28ebjEdMTw,411520,413280,beverage and report that it had an
B28ebjEdMTw,413280,415280,orange flavor and here's the craziest
B28ebjEdMTw,415280,417599,part this was true even after people
B28ebjEdMTw,417599,419199,were told that they had been messed with
B28ebjEdMTw,419199,420800,even when people knew that they were
B28ebjEdMTw,420800,422639,supposed to ignore the color it didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,422639,424639,change the fact that simply seeing a
B28ebjEdMTw,424639,426479,yellow liquid in a bottle made them more
B28ebjEdMTw,426479,428240,likely to think that it tasted like
B28ebjEdMTw,428240,430240,lemonade so knowing this i set out to do
B28ebjEdMTw,430240,431680,my own experiment with the help of
B28ebjEdMTw,431680,433840,several members of team theorist dan
B28ebjEdMTw,433840,435759,jerica amy and casey were all brave
B28ebjEdMTw,435759,437599,enough to film themselves on camera the
B28ebjEdMTw,437599,439919,things i do for my job i'm fine i was
B28ebjEdMTw,439919,441520,not forced into doing this at all this
B28ebjEdMTw,441520,443280,is not punishment for forgetting to do
B28ebjEdMTw,443280,445440,something this is totally normal such a
B28ebjEdMTw,445440,447840,normal job we also had a few extra
B28ebjEdMTw,447840,450479,volunteers no you can't have it it's
B28ebjEdMTw,450479,451520,gone
B28ebjEdMTw,451520,453520,the rest chose to remain anonymous for
B28ebjEdMTw,453520,455280,the experiment i created four batches of
B28ebjEdMTw,455280,456800,gummy bears to play with people's sense
B28ebjEdMTw,456800,458800,of taste they are gummies formerly known
B28ebjEdMTw,458800,460639,as bears because as you can see they are
B28ebjEdMTw,460639,463039,no longer a bear they are a blob they're
B28ebjEdMTw,463039,465440,a little melty because it's hot i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,465440,467520,trying to hide my other
B28ebjEdMTw,467520,470160,disgust at basically what feels like
B28ebjEdMTw,470160,472720,eating little bundles of
B28ebjEdMTw,472720,474479,snot all right so some of them may have
B28ebjEdMTw,474479,476720,gotten a little bit malformed on root
B28ebjEdMTw,476720,478000,california some are gonna do what
B28ebjEdMTw,478000,479919,california some are gonna do anyway the
B28ebjEdMTw,479919,482319,four categories were as follows one
B28ebjEdMTw,482319,484240,clear gummies two gummies that were
B28ebjEdMTw,484240,486080,colored to match their flavor three
B28ebjEdMTw,486080,488080,gummies that were colored to not match
B28ebjEdMTw,488080,490639,their flavor it's food theory hard mode
B28ebjEdMTw,490639,492319,and four a regular batch to eat
B28ebjEdMTw,492319,494639,blindfolded or using whatever eye
B28ebjEdMTw,494639,496240,shielding device they had in their
B28ebjEdMTw,496240,498400,vicinity apparently hello and welcome to
B28ebjEdMTw,498400,500080,we didn't have a blindfold in this house
B28ebjEdMTw,500080,502080,so this is gonna have to do high tech
B28ebjEdMTw,502080,504479,blindfold also side note man buns and
B28ebjEdMTw,504479,507039,head straps do not mix for each batch i
B28ebjEdMTw,507039,508960,cook the same five flavors it's also
B28ebjEdMTw,508960,510319,worth noting that i made sure that there
B28ebjEdMTw,510319,512560,was no smell for any of these guys since
B28ebjEdMTw,512560,514560,again smell can drastically affect your
B28ebjEdMTw,514560,516399,flavor perception from there i got our
B28ebjEdMTw,516399,518000,subjects to eat them and report for me
B28ebjEdMTw,518000,519599,whatever flavors they were tasting
B28ebjEdMTw,519599,521599,things that are usually creamy but
B28ebjEdMTw,521599,523440,paired with strawberries i'm gonna go
B28ebjEdMTw,523440,525600,with pear like i like how you can pair
B28ebjEdMTw,525600,528480,your mouse with the subscribe button
B28ebjEdMTw,528480,530240,that shameless plug is not gonna get you
B28ebjEdMTw,530240,532320,a bonus dan
B28ebjEdMTw,532320,535839,oh i heard it i heard i mean i didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,535839,537360,necessarily say that all the flavors
B28ebjEdMTw,537360,539839,were going to be good
B28ebjEdMTw,539839,542399,what was that and the team in true
B28ebjEdMTw,542399,544240,theorist form are doing their best to
B28ebjEdMTw,544240,546720,try and out-think me and the test are we
B28ebjEdMTw,546720,548320,thinking that they have to be fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,548320,550399,because generally candies are flavored
B28ebjEdMTw,550399,552399,as fruit in our breakfast when they're
B28ebjEdMTw,552399,554080,chocolate except when they're chocolate
B28ebjEdMTw,554080,556000,but are we predisposed in our brains to
B28ebjEdMTw,556000,557920,just kind of think that they're fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,557920,561360,flavors and not like grass yeah and so
B28ebjEdMTw,561360,562720,that's why i'm wondering if they're like
B28ebjEdMTw,562720,565440,if they're trying to trick us into
B28ebjEdMTw,565440,567839,thinking that they are going to be fruit
B28ebjEdMTw,567839,569600,flavored and then it ends up being
B28ebjEdMTw,569600,572080,something actually cheesecake flavored
B28ebjEdMTw,572080,575200,candle wax something that's not normal
B28ebjEdMTw,575200,577200,flavors it's moments like that that make
B28ebjEdMTw,577200,579120,me so proud of them anyway once they
B28ebjEdMTw,579120,580640,were done guessing i provided them an
B28ebjEdMTw,580640,584800,answer key to reveal the true flavors
B28ebjEdMTw,585000,587360,[Music]
B28ebjEdMTw,587360,591680,we were so wrong on so many levels the
B28ebjEdMTw,591680,593680,first major surprise came with the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,593680,595600,gummies i figured that clear gummies and
B28ebjEdMTw,595600,597519,the blindfolded test gummies would be
B28ebjEdMTw,597519,599279,pretty similar in result after all it's
B28ebjEdMTw,599279,601279,basically the same thing no colors to
B28ebjEdMTw,601279,603519,either give you a hint or mislead you
B28ebjEdMTw,603519,606320,but boy was i wrong it turns out that
B28ebjEdMTw,606320,608800,seeing clear is actually a lot different
B28ebjEdMTw,608800,610560,from seeing nothing when wearing a
B28ebjEdMTw,610560,612640,blindfold everyone was able to reliably
B28ebjEdMTw,612640,614399,pick out the correct flavors but when
B28ebjEdMTw,614399,616480,confronted with clear gummies something
B28ebjEdMTw,616480,618079,about the color just made the taste
B28ebjEdMTw,618079,619760,experience different here's how the
B28ebjEdMTw,619760,621440,testers reacted when eating a clear
B28ebjEdMTw,621440,623519,gummy with a citrus fruit flavor is it
B28ebjEdMTw,623519,626320,water is the taste of water water with
B28ebjEdMTw,626320,628160,like a teaspoon of sugar it tasted
B28ebjEdMTw,628160,630000,mostly just kind of like
B28ebjEdMTw,630000,631760,liquid everyone reported that the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,631760,633760,gummy tasted like nothing and mind you
B28ebjEdMTw,633760,635440,this is entirely due to the gummy's
B28ebjEdMTw,635440,636640,appearance unless you think it's
B28ebjEdMTw,636640,638240,something off about the flavor here was
B28ebjEdMTw,638240,639920,their reaction later in the test when
B28ebjEdMTw,639920,642079,they were given the exact same flavor of
B28ebjEdMTw,642079,644560,gummy but with red food coloring added
B28ebjEdMTw,644560,646959,blueberry i get strawberry big
B28ebjEdMTw,646959,648800,strawberry vinyl like orange fanta i
B28ebjEdMTw,648800,651440,hope this is uh helpful more helpful
B28ebjEdMTw,651440,653680,than you could imagine head editor dan
B28ebjEdMTw,653680,655279,the clear gummy put people in the
B28ebjEdMTw,655279,657920,mindset of water or a lack of flavor and
B28ebjEdMTw,657920,659680,that's exactly what they perceived
B28ebjEdMTw,659680,661839,something tasteless whereas with a red
B28ebjEdMTw,661839,663440,gummy suddenly they were getting hints
B28ebjEdMTw,663440,665279,of fruit with both casey and dan making
B28ebjEdMTw,665279,667120,incorrect choices of strawberry and
B28ebjEdMTw,667120,669440,watermelon classically red fruits to go
B28ebjEdMTw,669440,671680,along with the red coloring only jericho
B28ebjEdMTw,671680,673600,was able to correctly identify a tart
B28ebjEdMTw,673600,675600,citrus fruit to match the flavor that we
B28ebjEdMTw,675600,677360,had put in i was prepared for the
B28ebjEdMTw,677360,679360,possibility that misleading colors might
B28ebjEdMTw,679360,681040,throw people off but it hadn't even
B28ebjEdMTw,681040,682959,occurred to me that clear could do the
B28ebjEdMTw,682959,684800,same thing but it turned out that this
B28ebjEdMTw,684800,687360,was true for almost all of the clear
B28ebjEdMTw,687360,690160,gummies we were wrong we're so so wrong
B28ebjEdMTw,690160,692000,and when it did come to those mismatched
B28ebjEdMTw,692000,693920,flavor to color gummies the red herring
B28ebjEdMTw,693920,695920,effect was on full display one of our
B28ebjEdMTw,695920,697760,gummies was pineapple and when it was
B28ebjEdMTw,697760,700240,colored yellow people nailed it
B28ebjEdMTw,700240,704720,pineapple banana i got more like
B28ebjEdMTw,704720,706640,pineappley but when that same flavor was
B28ebjEdMTw,706640,708880,presented as a blue gummy haha the
B28ebjEdMTw,708880,711279,responses changed a lot i'm ready i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,711279,714800,ready okay what do you got i say like a
B28ebjEdMTw,714800,717200,sort of mouthwash again i got mouthwash
B28ebjEdMTw,717200,720160,too it started as like blueberry
B28ebjEdMTw,720160,722079,again all that changed here was the
B28ebjEdMTw,722079,723920,color everyone seemed to have the fix on
B28ebjEdMTw,723920,725519,pineapple when it was yellow but by
B28ebjEdMTw,725519,727279,simply taking the pineapple flavor and
B28ebjEdMTw,727279,728880,coloring it blue suddenly people's
B28ebjEdMTw,728880,730639,reactions tended toward things that you
B28ebjEdMTw,730639,732959,would associate with blue blueberry blue
B28ebjEdMTw,732959,735519,raspberry and of course mouthwash which
B28ebjEdMTw,735519,737040,i should mention was not one of the
B28ebjEdMTw,737040,739440,flavors included i would never
B28ebjEdMTw,739440,741440,fudge science
B28ebjEdMTw,741440,744480,but i would much rather be eating fudge
B28ebjEdMTw,744480,747360,than any of these i'm glad i didn't
B28ebjEdMTw,747360,749920,fudge it up
B28ebjEdMTw,750079,751600,those were some of the notable examples
B28ebjEdMTw,751600,752720,that i wanted to pick out but the
B28ebjEdMTw,752720,754720,overall data showed the exact same trend
B28ebjEdMTw,754720,756639,people were at their most accurate when
B28ebjEdMTw,756639,758399,given colored gummies whose color was
B28ebjEdMTw,758399,760240,chosen to match the flavor and they did
B28ebjEdMTw,760240,762320,almost as well when blindfolded but when
B28ebjEdMTw,762320,764560,the gummies became clear accuracy
B28ebjEdMTw,764560,766079,dropped considerably and when the
B28ebjEdMTw,766079,768079,gummies were misleadingly colored it led
B28ebjEdMTw,768079,770560,people to all sorts of wild conclusions
B28ebjEdMTw,770560,773680,in total zero percent of those responses
B28ebjEdMTw,773680,775440,wound up being right are you saying i'm
B28ebjEdMTw,775440,777760,flavor blind no i'm saying that
B28ebjEdMTw,777760,780000,everything in the world is a lie
B28ebjEdMTw,780000,782240,and nothing is real it's all a
B28ebjEdMTw,782240,783760,simulation
B28ebjEdMTw,783760,785440,this is a simulation within the
B28ebjEdMTw,785440,787519,simulation still all of this research to
B28ebjEdMTw,787519,789360,me felt incomplete because it was all
B28ebjEdMTw,789360,790959,coming from the premise that we have
B28ebjEdMTw,790959,792959,expectations about what food is supposed
B28ebjEdMTw,792959,794800,to look like but all of that is based on
B28ebjEdMTw,794800,796320,the assumption that we were able to form
B28ebjEdMTw,796320,798399,those visual expectations in the first
B28ebjEdMTw,798399,800160,place what happens when you do a blind
B28ebjEdMTw,800160,802079,taste test not with sighted people who
B28ebjEdMTw,802079,803920,are blindfolded but with people with
B28ebjEdMTw,803920,806000,congenital blindness the people who have
B28ebjEdMTw,806000,808480,been blind since birth researchers at
B28ebjEdMTw,808480,810160,the university of montreal school of
B28ebjEdMTw,810160,812560,optometry did a study looking at exactly
B28ebjEdMTw,812560,814240,this testing how vision affects the way
B28ebjEdMTw,814240,816399,that we eat and taste food they came
B28ebjEdMTw,816399,818079,back with results that range from the
B28ebjEdMTw,818079,820800,expected to the absolutely shocking
B28ebjEdMTw,820800,822399,first off one thing they discovered is
B28ebjEdMTw,822399,824079,that sighted people tend to respond to
B28ebjEdMTw,824079,826560,external context to decide when and what
B28ebjEdMTw,826560,828160,to eat turns out that all that
B28ebjEdMTw,828160,830720,image-based advertising works on us for
B28ebjEdMTw,830720,832880,sighted people simply seeing food can
B28ebjEdMTw,832880,835040,put us in the mood to eat regardless of
B28ebjEdMTw,835040,837040,how hungry we might actually be people
B28ebjEdMTw,837040,838560,with congenital blindness on the other
B28ebjEdMTw,838560,840320,hand were more likely to rely on
B28ebjEdMTw,840320,842720,internal hunger and satiety clues in
B28ebjEdMTw,842720,843839,other words they were doing the
B28ebjEdMTw,843839,845839,impossible they were basing their meal
B28ebjEdMTw,845839,848240,times on when they were actually hungry
B28ebjEdMTw,848240,849600,it turns out that the method preferred
B28ebjEdMTw,849600,851760,by blind individuals is actually a lot
B28ebjEdMTw,851760,853760,better for their health too in fact
B28ebjEdMTw,853760,855120,sighted people are more prone to
B28ebjEdMTw,855120,857279,maladaptive eating which leads to eating
B28ebjEdMTw,857279,859440,disorders in other words all those
B28ebjEdMTw,859440,861600,external cues that sighted people so
B28ebjEdMTw,861600,864480,often respond to like food ads work in
B28ebjEdMTw,864480,866480,both directions by making us eat when
B28ebjEdMTw,866480,868959,we're not hungry but also by making us
B28ebjEdMTw,868959,870959,not eat when we should be it would seem
B28ebjEdMTw,870959,873120,like eating too many snacks and skipping
B28ebjEdMTw,873120,874880,meals would be opposite problems but
B28ebjEdMTw,874880,876639,they actually both stem from the same
B28ebjEdMTw,876639,878639,fundamental problem which is looking at
B28ebjEdMTw,878639,880560,the external environment and letting the
B28ebjEdMTw,880560,882639,things we see including television ads
B28ebjEdMTw,882639,885040,and social media posts dictate what and
B28ebjEdMTw,885040,886880,when we eat rather than listening to our
B28ebjEdMTw,886880,888639,own body and letting those internal
B28ebjEdMTw,888639,890560,hunger cues decide when meal time should
B28ebjEdMTw,890560,891920,be but that wasn't even the most
B28ebjEdMTw,891920,893839,interesting part one of their hypotheses
B28ebjEdMTw,893839,895120,was that people with congenital
B28ebjEdMTw,895120,896880,blindness would have a sharper sense of
B28ebjEdMTw,896880,898560,taste after all the conventional wisdom
B28ebjEdMTw,898560,900480,is that the less you rely on your vision
B28ebjEdMTw,900480,902240,the more you have to rely on other
B28ebjEdMTw,902240,904399,senses and research has shown that blind
B28ebjEdMTw,904399,906399,individuals have a more nuanced sense of
B28ebjEdMTw,906399,908320,hearing and touch so the researchers
B28ebjEdMTw,908320,910320,thought the same would probably be true
B28ebjEdMTw,910320,912560,for taste as well but in fact it turned
B28ebjEdMTw,912560,914399,out to be the opposite their preliminary
B28ebjEdMTw,914399,916160,data suggested that blind people had a
B28ebjEdMTw,916160,917680,harder time when it came to tests
B28ebjEdMTw,917680,919120,involving taste detection and
B28ebjEdMTw,919120,921440,identification so what gives is this yet
B28ebjEdMTw,921440,923199,another case of sight affecting what we
B28ebjEdMTw,923199,925440,taste or was something else going on the
B28ebjEdMTw,925440,927120,researchers wanted to understand why
B28ebjEdMTw,927120,929120,this discrepancy existed in the data and
B28ebjEdMTw,929120,930560,they found that the blind individuals
B28ebjEdMTw,930560,932959,they studied had under-exposed taste
B28ebjEdMTw,932959,935040,systems in other words blind people had
B28ebjEdMTw,935040,937120,less variety in their diet and having a
B28ebjEdMTw,937120,938800,narrower palate made it harder for them
B28ebjEdMTw,938800,940560,to identify certain flavors now of
B28ebjEdMTw,940560,942320,course this answer wasn't that much of
B28ebjEdMTw,942320,944160,an answer just left the researchers with
B28ebjEdMTw,944160,946160,a different question why the blind
B28ebjEdMTw,946160,947920,individuals they talked to had less
B28ebjEdMTw,947920,949759,variety in their food diets one of the
B28ebjEdMTw,949759,951120,things they considered was food
B28ebjEdMTw,951120,953680,neophobia that is the fear of trying new
B28ebjEdMTw,953680,955360,foods the researchers originally
B28ebjEdMTw,955360,957199,hypothesized that blind individuals
B28ebjEdMTw,957199,959279,would score higher on this test and that
B28ebjEdMTw,959279,962480,hypothesis turned out to be 100
B28ebjEdMTw,962480,964639,wrong instead in defiance of their
B28ebjEdMTw,964639,966399,expectations the researchers found there
B28ebjEdMTw,966399,968399,was no difference between sighted people
B28ebjEdMTw,968399,969839,and people with congenital blindness
B28ebjEdMTw,969839,971120,when it came to how willing they were to
B28ebjEdMTw,971120,973040,try new foods the more they dug into the
B28ebjEdMTw,973040,974399,results the more it became clear what
B28ebjEdMTw,974399,976480,the real story here was the fact that
B28ebjEdMTw,976480,978240,blind individuals had less variety in
B28ebjEdMTw,978240,980000,their diet had nothing to do with their
B28ebjEdMTw,980000,982079,preferences and it had everything to do
B28ebjEdMTw,982079,983920,with what researchers described as
B28ebjEdMTw,983920,985759,blindness related obstacles when
B28ebjEdMTw,985759,988160,shopping for food cooking and eating out
B28ebjEdMTw,988160,990320,it's not that blind people didn't want
B28ebjEdMTw,990320,992399,to try new food it was that grocery
B28ebjEdMTw,992399,994000,stores and restaurants made it harder
B28ebjEdMTw,994000,995839,for them to try new foods by not
B28ebjEdMTw,995839,997600,accommodating their disability when a
B28ebjEdMTw,997600,999120,restaurant doesn't offer menus in
B28ebjEdMTw,999120,1000880,braille it's a lot easier to just say
B28ebjEdMTw,1000880,1002560,i'll take a hamburger or some other
B28ebjEdMTw,1002560,1004079,familiar food that you know is going to
B28ebjEdMTw,1004079,1005680,be on the menu by the way restaurant
B28ebjEdMTw,1005680,1006959,owners if you're looking for a way to
B28ebjEdMTw,1006959,1008720,get more business and make the world a
B28ebjEdMTw,1008720,1010720,more inclusive place to san seemingly
B28ebjEdMTw,1010720,1012560,small things can make a big difference
B28ebjEdMTw,1012560,1014240,when it comes to accessibility the good
B28ebjEdMTw,1014240,1015759,news is that's something we can take
B28ebjEdMTw,1015759,1017680,steps towards improving changing the
B28ebjEdMTw,1017680,1019279,world so it's more inclusive for
B28ebjEdMTw,1019279,1021120,everyone in the end though when it comes
B28ebjEdMTw,1021120,1023600,to taste sight matters sight can mislead
B28ebjEdMTw,1023600,1025520,us sight can make us hungry so it can
B28ebjEdMTw,1025520,1027600,make us skip meals it can make us taste
B28ebjEdMTw,1027600,1029600,things that aren't there and mistaste
B28ebjEdMTw,1029600,1031678,things that are there in many ways the
B28ebjEdMTw,1031678,1034558,ability to see is actually hampering our
B28ebjEdMTw,1034558,1037038,ability to truly taste so the next time
B28ebjEdMTw,1037038,1038880,you sit down to a meal try to eat with
B28ebjEdMTw,1038880,1041438,your mouth first instead of your eyes
B28ebjEdMTw,1041438,1043678,because the truth is always a little bit
B28ebjEdMTw,1043678,1046400,sweeter and remember it's all just a
B28ebjEdMTw,1046400,1050480,theory a food theory bon appetit well
