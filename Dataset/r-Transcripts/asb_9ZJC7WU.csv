asb_9ZJC7WU,5759,8639,what's up doll collectors hobbyist fab
asb_9ZJC7WU,8639,10160,some besties
asb_9ZJC7WU,10160,14080,i'm kind of curious about this it is
asb_9ZJC7WU,14080,16800,athletic tape and i think today is gonna
asb_9ZJC7WU,16800,19760,be an experimentation day i picked up
asb_9ZJC7WU,19760,22160,this athletic tape from target it was
asb_9ZJC7WU,22160,26320,like 279 and you get two rolls if you've
asb_9ZJC7WU,26320,28960,never used it it feels like fabric on
asb_9ZJC7WU,28960,32160,one side and then
asb_9ZJC7WU,32160,34239,it is sticky
asb_9ZJC7WU,34239,35520,on the other
asb_9ZJC7WU,35520,39040,let's see if we can make a no-sew tote
asb_9ZJC7WU,39040,40000,bag
asb_9ZJC7WU,40000,43520,stretch out some of the tape and cut it
asb_9ZJC7WU,43520,47680,take another piece and lay it on top
asb_9ZJC7WU,47680,51440,overlapping just a little and cut it
asb_9ZJC7WU,51440,55039,i carefully peel it up
asb_9ZJC7WU,55039,57600,flip it over so the sticky side is
asb_9ZJC7WU,57600,61920,facing up place more tape on top
asb_9ZJC7WU,61920,65280,so we have fabric on both sides we can
asb_9ZJC7WU,65280,67680,add multiple layers for a little
asb_9ZJC7WU,67680,72159,variation cut two rectangles or squares
asb_9ZJC7WU,72159,75439,for the front and back of our bag cut
asb_9ZJC7WU,75439,78880,another piece into strips
asb_9ZJC7WU,78880,81759,place it on the top edge
asb_9ZJC7WU,81759,85439,and fold it over so we have a nice
asb_9ZJC7WU,85439,89040,clean edge there trim off the excess
asb_9ZJC7WU,89040,92240,repeat for the other one then stack them
asb_9ZJC7WU,92240,95040,with the good side facing out take more
asb_9ZJC7WU,95040,96320,strips
asb_9ZJC7WU,96320,100320,and place them on the edges
asb_9ZJC7WU,100320,102159,and then wrap them over to the other
asb_9ZJC7WU,102159,105119,side on two of the sides so they're
asb_9ZJC7WU,105119,108479,connected and then across the bottom
asb_9ZJC7WU,108479,110399,making a pocket
asb_9ZJC7WU,110399,113520,take another strip that's long enough to
asb_9ZJC7WU,113520,117040,go up and over on the front of the bag i
asb_9ZJC7WU,117040,119600,have the sticky side facing up and i'm
asb_9ZJC7WU,119600,122320,going to lay another piece right on top
asb_9ZJC7WU,122320,124719,in the middle so it's still sticky on
asb_9ZJC7WU,124719,128640,the ends cut thin strips attach the
asb_9ZJC7WU,128640,132400,sticky side to the bag i'm placing mine
asb_9ZJC7WU,132400,135599,on the inside of the bag i attached two
asb_9ZJC7WU,135599,136959,for handles
asb_9ZJC7WU,136959,140800,to make an easy no-sew tote bag let's
asb_9ZJC7WU,140800,143280,see if we can add a little color i
asb_9ZJC7WU,143280,146080,prepared two rectangles for the front
asb_9ZJC7WU,146080,149360,and back of the bag i'm using a washable
asb_9ZJC7WU,149360,151200,marker
asb_9ZJC7WU,151200,154720,to color it i did yellow
asb_9ZJC7WU,154720,158959,now let's add some orange red and maybe
asb_9ZJC7WU,158959,162560,a little more going around the sides add
asb_9ZJC7WU,162560,165440,a few drops of water
asb_9ZJC7WU,165440,168640,so the colors blend then allow it to dry
asb_9ZJC7WU,168640,171200,then i use a pen
asb_9ZJC7WU,171200,174800,to make a design assemble the bag to
asb_9ZJC7WU,174800,177840,make the dolls another tote let's lay
asb_9ZJC7WU,177840,181360,down another piece of tape take another
asb_9ZJC7WU,181360,185280,piece and carefully cut off the edge
asb_9ZJC7WU,185280,187040,place it on top
asb_9ZJC7WU,187040,189040,overlapping
asb_9ZJC7WU,189040,192400,i made three then flip them over and
asb_9ZJC7WU,192400,195760,cover the other side so we have three
asb_9ZJC7WU,195760,200319,panels cut one in the shape of a skirt
asb_9ZJC7WU,200319,203840,cut the other two pieces to line up with
asb_9ZJC7WU,203840,205360,the back
asb_9ZJC7WU,205360,209200,and overlap i take another piece of tape
asb_9ZJC7WU,209200,212799,and put a smaller piece on top
asb_9ZJC7WU,212799,215360,right in the center take the largest
asb_9ZJC7WU,215360,218159,panel and i'm going to fold it in half
asb_9ZJC7WU,218159,220959,and cut a little curve
asb_9ZJC7WU,220959,223760,take the new piece we just made
asb_9ZJC7WU,223760,225840,and there's stickiness going around the
asb_9ZJC7WU,225840,228239,sides we're gonna just line it up with
asb_9ZJC7WU,228239,232400,the top edge and stick it on place the
asb_9ZJC7WU,232400,235519,back of the skirt on top lining it up on
asb_9ZJC7WU,235519,238720,the sides to trim off the excess
asb_9ZJC7WU,238720,241920,creating little pocket like areas
asb_9ZJC7WU,241920,245360,hopefully this works let's take the back
asb_9ZJC7WU,245360,247599,and line it up with the edge
asb_9ZJC7WU,247599,249439,use thin strips
asb_9ZJC7WU,249439,251040,on the sides
asb_9ZJC7WU,251040,254239,folding it over the edge to connect the
asb_9ZJC7WU,254239,256959,two pieces can you see that i know all
asb_9ZJC7WU,256959,259440,this white might be hard to see
asb_9ZJC7WU,259440,262320,but i also added some tape on the edge
asb_9ZJC7WU,262320,265680,of the pockets with both sides connected
asb_9ZJC7WU,265680,269360,we can wrap it around the doll
asb_9ZJC7WU,269360,270960,and see if we need to trim it in the
asb_9ZJC7WU,270960,271759,back
asb_9ZJC7WU,271759,274880,i trimmed about this much from the sides
asb_9ZJC7WU,274880,276479,take a thin strip
asb_9ZJC7WU,276479,280720,and cut two small notches
asb_9ZJC7WU,280720,284080,on the side then fold
asb_9ZJC7WU,284080,287758,the center over
asb_9ZJC7WU,288080,288670,like
asb_9ZJC7WU,288670,291040,[Laughter]
asb_9ZJC7WU,291040,292639,like so
asb_9ZJC7WU,292639,294639,there we go
asb_9ZJC7WU,294639,297840,there we go leaving two sticky tabs on
asb_9ZJC7WU,297840,299040,the ends
asb_9ZJC7WU,299040,301840,set those aside then take a long strip
asb_9ZJC7WU,301840,302639,and
asb_9ZJC7WU,302639,304240,cut off the ends
asb_9ZJC7WU,304240,307039,cut a long strip and
asb_9ZJC7WU,307039,309600,apply it to the bottom
asb_9ZJC7WU,309600,313120,folding it over the edge to clean up the
asb_9ZJC7WU,313120,315520,bottom of the skirt let's take those
asb_9ZJC7WU,315520,317680,little small pieces we made with the
asb_9ZJC7WU,317680,320320,sticky part on the ends and i'm going to
asb_9ZJC7WU,320320,323039,slide it right between the pocket and
asb_9ZJC7WU,323039,324800,the front
asb_9ZJC7WU,324800,327759,and stick it down i added two and then
asb_9ZJC7WU,327759,330320,i'm gonna fold them forward then take
asb_9ZJC7WU,330320,332479,another long strip
asb_9ZJC7WU,332479,335120,and we're gonna place it right on the
asb_9ZJC7WU,335120,336320,edge
asb_9ZJC7WU,336320,338400,fold it over the back
asb_9ZJC7WU,338400,342400,then take those tabs and flip them over
asb_9ZJC7WU,342400,346160,and stick them to the back to make belt
asb_9ZJC7WU,346160,349280,loops i have a little velcro and we can
asb_9ZJC7WU,349280,352720,glue it or sew it to the back i chose to
asb_9ZJC7WU,352720,356080,sew it however it wasn't the neatest job
asb_9ZJC7WU,356080,358080,but let's not pay attention to that and
asb_9ZJC7WU,358080,360960,only appreciate it from the front we can
asb_9ZJC7WU,360960,364800,glue on a few more details to really
asb_9ZJC7WU,364800,368400,sell the look let's make a matching top
asb_9ZJC7WU,368400,372240,i cut four small pieces i cut an oval
asb_9ZJC7WU,372240,374880,shape from a post-it note making sure i
asb_9ZJC7WU,374880,377759,have the sticky side on the other side i
asb_9ZJC7WU,377759,381120,place it onto the tape and
asb_9ZJC7WU,381120,382800,cut around it
asb_9ZJC7WU,382800,385280,repeat for all four pieces
asb_9ZJC7WU,385280,389680,then i cut a line in the center and
asb_9ZJC7WU,389680,391600,overlap it
asb_9ZJC7WU,391600,394160,creating a piece that will contour to
asb_9ZJC7WU,394160,396639,the doll's body i'm working with white
asb_9ZJC7WU,396639,399039,material sometimes it can be kind of
asb_9ZJC7WU,399039,401600,hard to see so i've made my lighting a
asb_9ZJC7WU,401600,404800,little darker i did all four right now
asb_9ZJC7WU,404800,407600,they're all pushed in i'm gonna push one
asb_9ZJC7WU,407600,408639,out
asb_9ZJC7WU,408639,411840,then take another one and stick it to
asb_9ZJC7WU,411840,413120,oops
asb_9ZJC7WU,413120,415520,stick it to the other side
asb_9ZJC7WU,415520,419520,carefully so we have cloth on both sides
asb_9ZJC7WU,419520,422960,cover the edges with strips of tape
asb_9ZJC7WU,422960,425840,connect them with a large piece of tape
asb_9ZJC7WU,425840,428720,i overlapped mine just a little
asb_9ZJC7WU,428720,431039,then fold it over
asb_9ZJC7WU,431039,433919,covering all of the sticky edges make
asb_9ZJC7WU,433919,436400,straps just like we did for the belt
asb_9ZJC7WU,436400,439840,loops where the ends are sticky attach
asb_9ZJC7WU,439840,441759,the sticky end
asb_9ZJC7WU,441759,443360,to the
asb_9ZJC7WU,443360,445360,front
asb_9ZJC7WU,445360,448400,and the other side to the back add
asb_9ZJC7WU,448400,451280,velcro so it can close
asb_9ZJC7WU,451280,453360,glue on details
