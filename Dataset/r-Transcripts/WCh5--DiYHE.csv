WCh5--DiYHE,109776,116782,HOUSE.  25-YEAR-OLD CASSIDY HUTCHINSON  WAS A LONG-TIME AIDE TO CHIEF   OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS WHO   TESTIFIED TO WHAT WAS GOING ON
WCh5--DiYHE,116782,124390,BEHIND THE SCENES WHEN THAT MOB   ATTACKED THE U.S. COOPER.   SHE SAID THE FORMER PRESIDENT   KNEW HIS SUPPORTERS COULD GET

WCh5--DiYHE,130229,136102,"PHASE HIM, SINCE, AS SHE PUT  IT, HE FELT THEY WERE NOT THERE   TO HURT HIM."
WCh5--DiYHE,136102,145411,THAT DID NOT CHANGE AFTER SOME

WCh5--DiYHE,177977,183449,SHE TESTIFIED THAT THE  PRESIDENT TRIED TO COMMAND EAR  HIS VEHICLE IN THE MOTORCADE
WCh5--DiYHE,183449,189455,AND GET TO THE CAPITOL.   >> SO IF THE PRESIDENT HAD  GOTTEN INTO THE VICK WITH

WCh5--DiYHE,287653,294527,OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE?   >> I THINK THEY WERE VERY   PLEASED WITH WHAT -- THE WAY IT

WCh5--DiYHE,306005,312011,PARTS OF HER STORY.   THAT'S HOW THEY'LL TRY TO   UNRAVEL THE WHOLE THING THAT  THIS INCIDENT IN THE CAR.   WE KNOW -- TRUMP HAS ALREADY
WCh5--DiYHE,312011,319519,SAID HE YELLED -- HE WAS ANGRY  AND YELLED AT SEE CREDIT  SERVICE AGENT IN A CAR. 
WCh5--DiYHE,319519,324757,WHETHER OR NOT HE LUNGED  NOVEMBER WHEEL.   I'M NOT SURE THAT'S GERMANE.
WCh5--DiYHE,324757,330029,WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THIS.  THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WAS 
WCh5--DiYHE,330029,336869,"FURIOUS ABOUT HIS LOST RE-  ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF 2020,  COULDN'T HANDLE IT, AND HE KEPT   PUSHING CHIPS ON THE TABLE. "
WCh5--DiYHE,336869,344444,"HE KEPT UPPING THE PRESSURE AND   UP BE THE PRESSURE, AND SHE,  THE WAY CASSIDY HUTCHINSON TOLD   IT, HE WAS THROWING A PLATE AT"
WCh5--DiYHE,344444,355087,"THE WALL AFTER BILL BARR SAID I   DIDN'T FIND ANY WIDESPREAD  ELECTION FRAUD.   HE WAS -- YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS "
WCh5--DiYHE,355087,360793,"TOLD THAT THERE WERE CHANNELS   OF HANG MIKE PENCE, HE DIDN'T   CARE.   HE WAS TELLING PEOPLE HE WAS  OKAY WITH THAT. "
WCh5--DiYHE,360793,366332,"THIS WAS AN ANGRY, YOU KNOW, I  DON'T WANT TO SAY OUT OF  CONTROL, BUT BORDERLINE OUT OF  CONTROL PRESIDENT, AND HE WAS "
WCh5--DiYHE,366332,372171,"WILLING TO DO WHAT IT TOOK TO   OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE   ELECTION, AND WE THINK JUST --"
WCh5--DiYHE,372171,377443,"IT'S JUST SHOCKING.   IT'S KIND OF STUNNING HEAR IT   ALL, THE NARRATIVE LAID OUT   LIKE THAT.  >> YEAH, JOHN, SENSE YOU"
WCh5--DiYHE,377443,384116,MENTIONED THAT.   HERE IS THE PART OF THE HEAR  WRONG CASSIDY HUTCHINSON TALKED   ABOUT SOME OF THE BEHIND THE
WCh5--DiYHE,384116,390690,SCENES CONVERSATION IN RESPONSE   TO THE MOB CALLING FOR MIKE 
WCh5--DiYHE,390690,395728,"PENCE'S HEAD.   WATCH.  >> I REMEMBER PAT SAYING SOME   TO THE EFFECT OF, MARK, WE NEED "
WCh5--DiYHE,395728,403069,"TO DO SOMETHING MORE.   THEY'RE LITERALLY CALLING FOR   THE PRESIDENT TO BE F'ING LUNG,   AND MARK HAD RESPONDING SOME TO "
WCh5--DiYHE,403069,409208,"THE EFFECT OF YOU HEARD IT,   PAT, HE THINKS MIKE DESERVES  IT, HE DOESN'T THINK THEY'RE"
WCh5--DiYHE,409208,417984,"DOING ANYTHING WRONG, TO WHICH  PAT SAID SOMETHING, THIS IS   F'ING CRAZY, WE NEED TO BE"
WCh5--DiYHE,417984,423256,"DOING SOMETHING MORE.   >> JOEL, WHAT ABOUT THE FALLOUT   FROM HERE AND WHERE THIS GOES "
WCh5--DiYHE,423256,428461,FOR EXAMPLE HERE.   LET ME PLAY WIN MORE CLIP FROM
WCh5--DiYHE,428461,436668,THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH AND  PAT'S CONCERNS' BUT WHAT THE  AFTERMATH OF IT AIM MIGHT BE. 
WCh5--DiYHE,436668,443308,"WATCH.  >> I SAW HIM RIGHT BEFORE I   WALKED OUT THAT MORNING, AND"
WCh5--DiYHE,443308,448981,"MR. SIPILONI SAID SOMETHING TO  THE EFFECT OF PLEASE MAKE SURE  WE TONIGHT GO UP TO THE   CAPITOL, CASSIDY, KEEP IN TOUCH "
WCh5--DiYHE,448981,454921,WITH ME.  WE'RE GOING TO GET CHARGED WITH   EVERY CRIME IMAGINABLE IF WE
WCh5--DiYHE,454921,462895,MAKE THAT MOVEMENT HAPPEN.  >> AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH  CRIMES HE WAS CONCERNED WITH?   >> IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO
WCh5--DiYHE,462895,468467,"THE 6th, WE HAD CONVERSATIONS   ABOUT POTENTIALLY OBSTRUCTING "
WCh5--DiYHE,468467,474140,"JUSTICE, OR DEFRAUDING THE  ELECTORAL COUNT.  >> THERE WAS ALSO TALK ABOUT  THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND   LAWMAKERS WHO ASKED FOR PARDONS "
WCh5--DiYHE,474140,480246,KIND OF EARLY IN THIS PROCESS.  SHE LAID OUT QUITE A FEW OF   THEM.   HOW DOES THIS AFFECT YOUR VIEW
WCh5--DiYHE,480246,485484,IN TERMS OF ACTUAL CRIMINAL   ACTIONS THAT MAY COME FROM ALL  OF THIS?
WCh5--DiYHE,485484,491757,"I THINK IT STILL REMAINS  SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE IN SOME   WAYS, AND PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT"
WCh5--DiYHE,491757,498998,CLEAR IN OTHERS.  >> IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN  A LITTLE BIT CLEARER.   I THINK THAT SHE PROVIDED 
WCh5--DiYHE,498998,506272,"ENOUGH TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS  KNOWLEDGE, HIS INTENT, AND HIS"
WCh5--DiYHE,506272,511644,"ACTIONS TO BRING AT LEAST TO  FULL INVESTIGATION FOR THINGS   LIKE OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS, "
WCh5--DiYHE,511644,518050,"WHICH IS, OF COURSE, A FEDERAL  CRIME, AND WHICH HE CLEARLY WAS "
WCh5--DiYHE,518050,525458,"INTENDING.  THE INCITING OF AN  INSURRECTION, WHICH IS A CRIME  THAT WOULD BAR HIM FROM EVER  HOLDING OFFICE AGAIN, SO IT'S "
WCh5--DiYHE,525458,531998,"AN IMPORTANT ONE, AND SHE   CLEARLY MADE THAT PLAIN.  THE OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS "
WCh5--DiYHE,531998,537837,"MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BAR HIM FROM   HOLDING OFFICE, BUT IT IS A "
WCh5--DiYHE,537837,544410,CRIMINAL CASE.  BEYONDING THE U.S. IS ANOTHER   CRIME THAT SHE LAID OUT.  SO I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS. 
WCh5--DiYHE,544410,550616,"IT AND ALSO SHOWS THAT HIS  AIDES KNEW THAT THEY WERE DOING   THINGS THAT WERE CRIMINAL,  BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD THEY BE"
WCh5--DiYHE,550616,557490,ASKING FOR PARDONS?   BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT WHAT   THEY WERE DOING WAS CRIMINAL.   AND I SEE THIS BOTH AS A
WCh5--DiYHE,557490,563729,"PROSECUTOR BEING A VERY VIABLE  CASE, AND I SEE IT AS A VOTER,"
WCh5--DiYHE,563729,570569,"AND A CITIZEN, AS SOMETHING   THAT WOULD AFFECT MY VOTE IN  CONSIDERING WHO I WOULD   SUPPORT, AND WHAT I WOULD   DEMAND OF PEOPLE WHO I WAS"
WCh5--DiYHE,570569,576642,"VOTING FOR, AND FOX NEWS DID  CARRY THIS HEARING TODAY, SO  I'M HOPING THAT SOME OF THE "
WCh5--DiYHE,576642,583215,"PEOPLE WATCHING THAT ARE  RETHINKING THEIR SUPPORT FOR  DONALD TRUMP, NOT ONLY BECAUSE  OF THROWING A PLATE AT THE WALL "
WCh5--DiYHE,583215,588320,"AND HAVING, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND   OF AN OUTBREAK, WHICH WOULDEN "
WCh5--DiYHE,588320,594260,WANT SOMEONE WHO HAS THE  NUCLEAR CODES TO ACT IN THAT
WCh5--DiYHE,594260,599365,"MANNER, BUT, ALSO, WHETHER HE   GRABBED THE STEERING WHEEL,   WHICH HER TESTIMONY SEEMED VERY "
WCh5--DiYHE,599365,604970,"CREDIBLE TO ME, VERY  BELIEVABLE, AND VERY  CONSISTENT, AND IT'S ALWAYS IN  HIS MIND PROJECTION, IT'S "
WCh5--DiYHE,604970,610910,"SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT.   HE NOW DOESN'T EACH KNOW WHO  SHE IS, WHICH IS, OF COURSE,"
WCh5--DiYHE,610910,616448,"IRRELEVANT.   DOESN'T MATTER IF HE KNOWS HER.   SHE HEARD, SHE TESTIFIED.   THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT, BY"
WCh5--DiYHE,616448,623155,"AND THINK THE URGENCY FOR HER   TESTIFYING TODAY IS MAYBE THAT  SHE IS ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHO   WAS THREATENED, AND THEY WANTED   TO GET HER ON RECORD TO "
WCh5--DiYHE,623155,629729,"MINIMIZE THAT THREAT, BECAUSE   ONCE IT'S OUT IN PUBLIC, THE"
WCh5--DiYHE,629729,635668,"THREATS ADMINISTERED.   >>> WE WANT TO TALK A MINUTE  WITH STEVE ABOUT SOME OF THE  PRIMARIES GOING ON TODAY, BUT,"
WCh5--DiYHE,635668,641273,"JOHN, WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS OF  THE IMPACT OF THESE HEARINGS  BEYOND WASHINGTON, IN ANYWAY. "
WCh5--DiYHE,641273,646612,"THE COMMITTEE KIND OF MADE IT   SOUND LIKE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE   TO HEAR FROM THIS YOUNG WOMAN   TODAY,, IT'S TOO UP IMPORTANT,"
WCh5--DiYHE,646612,652151,"ITSELF CAN'T WAIT, IT BUILDS ON   EVERYWHERE ELSE WE'RE DOING.  I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF"
WCh5--DiYHE,652151,657690,"SPECULATION IN WHETHER THESE  HEARINGS ARE MOVING THE NEEDLE,   SO TO SPEAK, WHETHER THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY"
WCh5--DiYHE,657690,663161,"PAYING ATTENTION, WHETHER THIS  IS GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT.  HOW DO YOU SEE IT?  >> IT'S HARD TO TELL. "
WCh5--DiYHE,663161,669568,THIS IS THE SIXTH OF THESE  HEARINGS.   THEY'VE BEEN VERY DRAMATIC. 
WCh5--DiYHE,669568,675941,"THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE UNCOVERED  A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION.   THE VIEW THEY HAVE PRESENTED OF   THE -- OF NOT ONLY TRUMP, BUT "
WCh5--DiYHE,675941,683048,"THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN  CONGRESS, ESPECIALLY ON THE   HOUSE SIDE, IS PRESIDENT POOR,  AND A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE"
WCh5--DiYHE,683048,689121,"RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION THIS  YEAR, AND KEVIN McCARTHY, WHO   PLAYED A ROLE IN TODAY'S  HEARINGS, WANTS TO BE SPEAKER "
WCh5--DiYHE,689121,694693,"OF THE HOUSE.   YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY.   I DON'T THINK YOU COULD TAKE"
WCh5--DiYHE,694693,701133,"THIS IN ISOLATION.  YOU TAKE THIS LIKE THE ROE  RULING.   BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT,"
WCh5--DiYHE,701133,708307,"YOU HAVE A SERIES OF BAD  ECONOMIC NEWS THAT IS DRIVING   PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S RATINGS,  YOU KNOW, DOWN INTO THE LOW 40s "
WCh5--DiYHE,708307,713411,AND 30s.  I THINK THIS IS -- I THINK THIS   IS DAMAGING.  IS IT ENOUGH TO SWING AN
WCh5--DiYHE,713411,719585,"ELECTION?   PROBABLY NOT, BUT I THINK YOU   HAVE TO PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT."
WCh5--DiYHE,719585,724824,"THE DAY OF THE ATTACK, 140  REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST "
WCh5--DiYHE,724824,730161,"CERTIFYING JOE BIDEN'S  ELECTORAL VICTORY.  I MEAN, THEY KNEW WHAT WAS  GOING ON WAS WRONG, AND YET "
WCh5--DiYHE,730161,735901,"THEY STILL SIDED WITH TRUMP ON  IT, AND THINK THAT IS -- IF YOU   WANT TO GO BEHIND ON WHAT YOUR"
WCh5--DiYHE,735901,742107,"PARTY STANDS TO ARE, THE  DEMOCRATS ON ONE SIDE AND THE   REPUBLICANS ON THE OTHER, YOU   CAN'T HAVE A MORE CLEAR RED "
WCh5--DiYHE,742107,749181,"LINE, AND I THINK VOTERS WILL   HAVE A VERY CLEAR CHOICE THIS   NOVEMBER.   WE'LL SEE WHICH SIDE BANGS OUT"
WCh5--DiYHE,749181,754854,MORE OF THEIR OWN FOLKS.  >> ONE MORE QUICK THING BEFORE  I HAVE TO GO.   A LOT OF THE NARRATIVE FROM 
WCh5--DiYHE,754854,761560,"TODAY'S HEARING HAD TO DO WITH  THE PEOPLE AROUND THE PRESIDENT   WHO TRIED TO REIGN HIM IN,"
WCh5--DiYHE,761560,767165,"INCLUDING THE SECRET SERVICE  AGENT WHO MISS HUTCHINSON SAID  GOT LUNGED AT BY THE PRESIDENT,   OR EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO SAID "
WCh5--DiYHE,767165,774039,THERE IS NO SAFEWAY TO GET YOU  TO THE CAPITOL AND BACK.  THERE WAS TALK ABOUT THE
WCh5--DiYHE,774039,781714,"INVOCATION OF THE 25th  AMENDMENT, WHICH CONTAINS A   CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE  PRESIDENCY TO BE TAKEN FROM THE "

WCh5--DiYHE,793559,798964,"SIGNIFICANT, AND IT FEELS   LINING THAT WAS A HUGE PART OF  THE PERHAPS GROWING NARRATIVE   THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO "

WCh5--DiYHE,815414,820653,"DEMOCRACY.  THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE   TELLING THE PRESIDENT THERE IT  WAS IN FRAUD, YOU LOST THIS "
WCh5--DiYHE,820653,827259,ELECTION.   YOU LOST IT FAIR AND SQUARE.  IT IS ILLEGAL TO DO THE THINGS  YOU ARE SUGGESTING IN TERMS OF
