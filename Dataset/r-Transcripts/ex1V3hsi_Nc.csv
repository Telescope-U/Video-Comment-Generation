ex1V3hsi_Nc,0,6960,"Hello, welcome back, today I thoughtÂ weÂ could do something a little different  and instead of drawing myÂ art, I could draw your art,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,6960,12559,"I suppose in the end, it'sÂ still my art because I drew it  but it's not my art because it's your art,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,12560,22160,"Roll the waffle. ðŸŽµ  So I thought we'd start out with this one,  this is a drawing by Grace and IÂ love that they included the colors"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,22160,28000,"so we can make it look exact, how perfect is that?  Now, since I do want to send this to Grace,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,28000,36560,I'm going to draw it on paperÂ that fits in my envelopes  which happens to be paper IÂ don't really like using anymore.  I used to use it a lot then I justÂ realized colors aren't as easy to use
ex1V3hsi_Nc,36560,42960,as with some other papers  but I figured I could just sacrificeÂ an extra piece of paper to swatch
ex1V3hsi_Nc,42960,48960,so we know what the colors will look like on here  because when I go wrong is whenÂ I'm swatching someplace else  and then move to here becauseÂ this ends up looking darker
ex1V3hsi_Nc,48960,55440,"so if we just swatch withÂ the paper we plan on using,  I shouldn't have that problem butÂ also, for this one specifically,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,55440,61280,"we gotta go ahead and use theÂ markers that we're told to use.  So these are from the OhuhuÂ pastel set it looks like,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,61280,67840,"so that's eggshell white, sand for the hair,  pink for the blush, paleÂ grayish blue for the shorts,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,67840,74000,"looking like I don't have thisÂ one, wait, wait, I found it,  it just doesn't look like the cap at all"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,74000,80640,"so I was looking at the wrong spot but yeah,  that is vivid reddish purple for the stripe  and that is all of our colors."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,80640,86320,"I will go into my sketchbook,Â not to swatch the colors  but just to kind of figure out our poses."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,86320,95200,"Go ahead and start with a pink col-erase pencil.  So Grace drew them, I thinkÂ they're waving with one hand down"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,95200,103200,"so that means the head goesÂ on the top, we have the body,  they're just kind of standing there  but I might like to add a littleÂ uh, I don't know, oomph, let's say"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,103200,108320,and so I'm going to use an action line  and just kind of do a swoop so that'sÂ like the weight is all on this foot
ex1V3hsi_Nc,108320,113840,"which means this foot can kind of just hang out.  Kneecap, little foot there."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,114960,122960,"Now, line of actions, I don'tÂ think I use them quite correctly.  I don't necessarily need them toÂ give a little life to my sketches"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,122960,128800,just because I kind of know what I like  but I think the rule of thumbÂ is that you go through the head
ex1V3hsi_Nc,128800,136160,"and then kind of hit the ground  and then that's where likeÂ the weight of the body is.  So if it helps, try it outÂ or look it up and figure out"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,136160,143120,"how you're actually supposed to use it.  Oh I've run into a tiny problem.  So I turned the character to theÂ right, now we want this arm up right"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,143120,149680,"but if we do put that up, it's going toÂ kind of end up with a weird silhouette  but we'll try, we can do this arm definitely."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,149680,155680,"So, draw little circles for the shoulders.  I kind of draw a little swooshy line for the arm."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,155680,163599,"I'm kind of imitating that swoosh right there  and then we'll just add in the flesh  and then the hand, the thumb'sÂ kind of coming downwards,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,163600,167920,"kind of hang it there, loosey-goosey,Â gonna move the heart to this side."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,169360,177440,"I forgot this is just a sketch,  we're just kind of figuring out how we want things  but it's looking good.  Alright, we need to put in aÂ head here, not sure what style,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,177440,186080,"do I want a more simple style?  It's one of the reasons IÂ wanted to make this video  because I just wanted to redraw this,Â I love the style it's like so cute"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,186080,194080,"and just like the colors are so wellÂ done and like not patchy at all.  I'm just amazed, I think I want toÂ just copy that mouth a little bit."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,194080,199440,"These teeth are funny, I'm gonna squint my eyes,  make them look even smilie-r."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,199440,205280,"You have that round nose and nowÂ this character doesn't have any ears  but that's kind of my thing to add ears,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,205280,212560,"so I don't think we can go without that.  Bangs, the character has bangs and a bigÂ ponytail with a little curl at the end"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,212560,219680,"and there's a v-neck for theÂ tank top, kind of loose fitted  so we'll add a little swoosh and there's a stripe,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,219680,226160,"kind of keep in mind the motion.  Okay, so that's all working out.  Now, it looks like they're barefoot, so we'll add some little toes."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,226160,232800,"Now, hopefully you can see thisÂ sketch, it's a little light.  I might also just to add a little color up here,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,232800,239840,add a scrunchie just to create a separation  between the front and the back.  They did a really good job with this line
ex1V3hsi_Nc,239840,245840,"but I just want to go a little further.  We could lower, so this handÂ is like level with the chin."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,245840,251600,"We'll try putting it um, a little lower.  Nope that is not it, I wantÂ to have more fluid motion"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,251600,257280,like this arm and that arm.  We could also make the hair way longer  and that'll remove that tangent becauseÂ we have like the curls of the hair
ex1V3hsi_Nc,257280,263120,"happening at the same place as the hand.  Move the hand over the shoulder, maybe.  Okay, the elbow would be pointing in."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,263120,270880,"Let's go with some big pony hair.  I think that's too big, it's startingÂ to look a little too different  from the source material, it's crazy though,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,270880,277760,"like looking at this one, you canÂ kind of see all the elements in it  but it's not 'til drawing it that I realize  how they kind of interact with each other"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,277760,282960,so I'm thinking that was a good idea  but I am going to move to ourÂ finished piece of paper here.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,282960,289120,"Alright, Grace, wish me luck.  Line of action, flip with allÂ the weight on it, extra foot."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,289120,296000,"I decided on hands on hipsÂ and then we have this hand  which I'm really happy withÂ the way that turned out,  so let's try and do that exactly the same."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,296000,301280,"Let's make that like a little bit longer,  I've somehow missed this side of the paper."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,301280,306160,I'm just gonna start over.  I just kind of want to move her over.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,306800,312719,"Let me just try, we'reÂ gonna move it over a little.  Maybe it's just that pose,Â kind of looks off-centered."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,312720,317600,Can I just do all the same stuff here.  I left the face on that oneÂ so let me try that again.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,319200,326000,"Maybe make the chin a littleÂ longer, a little bean mouth.  These ones, the legs were more spread apart."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,326000,335200,"This one, I actually tried toÂ put all the weight on one foot.  Maybe that's the problem.  More like this, now she's just like heroÂ posing, that wasn't the goal either."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,335200,340800,"Oh I've fallen into a bit of a pickle.  Alright, alright, I think theÂ hips are the problem here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,341840,348080,"Maybe I just needed to move that leg.  Ah that's better, that's better,Â go on ahead, give them some bangs."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,348640,355680,Do a little bowl cut for the bangs.  Let's figure out the shouldersÂ and the shirt loose fitting.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,357040,363600,So far happy with everything butÂ this arm which isn't really even done  and I gotta figure out whereÂ the ponytail is gonna go.  We're just gonna come this way.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,363600,369680,I'm gonna make the scrunchie a little smaller.  Just have to figure out this arm.  That just looks odd.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,369680,374800,"Honestly, it doesn't lookÂ that bad, just going behind.  Could do this but it's just behind everything."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,375360,381199,Or we can bring the hand up evenÂ higher to like the small of the waist.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,381200,389280,"Alright, I think that's it, soÂ I'm gonna add the color in first  and then do the line art.  so let's start with skin inÂ the color eggshell white."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,389920,396240,"I'm so nervous, start with this little hand.  Now I haven't erased any of the pencil  because I love the way it looks underneath marker"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,396240,404000,"and it'll help with line artÂ if you can see it, you know?  Okay, theirs looks so much smoother.  That's another reason I don'tÂ really like this paper so much."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,404000,412800,"It does get kind of patchy  and if you kind of go aroundÂ the outside edges first,  it's easier to fill it in withoutÂ looking too patchy, do swirlies."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,414480,418560,"Alrighty, that's the skin, next we need E220."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,419680,424720,"E220, I suppose, for the hair.  Oh it looks way greener on my paper"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,424720,431600,"so maybe as it dries it'll look more warm.  Trace the outside edge, colored in."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,431600,437199,"Oops, I went over the skin anyway.  Okay, oh eyebrows, you can use this color, too."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,438560,446240,"Alright for blush, they used this color.  I can see it's not quite theÂ right color for the skin tone  because it's actually liftingÂ instead of creating a darker color"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,446240,452159,"but we will follow the key.  Put a little on the ears, maybeÂ a little under the nose, knees."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,453360,460000,"Alright, next up we got shorts.  And finally the stripe on the shirt."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,462240,467360,"And I'm gonna use it on the scrunchie.  Alright, so that's it, I justÂ need to add some line art."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,467360,473120,"I'm gonna decide what size, Â I could use point three maybe,  point three might be too small, let's see."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,476880,479040,I forgot how stressful it is to do tiny line art.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,482080,488479,"A little swoosh and we need some eyes, pull that in"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,490240,494479,"and then the teeth, perfect and the nose."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,495600,497680,"Oof, I don't like this hand, what happened?"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,501840,509520,"Little swoosh, all that's left is the shorts here.  These legs that gave me so much trouble."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,510480,517360,"Oh, big toe, little big toe, is that a country band or something.  There we go.  I'm going to add some blush to this hand."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,517360,522400,Let's try that out.  See if that solves some of my problems.  Hey I think that's it.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,522400,527920,I can erase some of the pencilÂ that's underneath the white  since that's supposed to be white.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,527920,534563,"Show you up close, here's mine.  Oh I didn't add the hearts.  do -do -do-do-do-do. Put it right there."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,534563,541839,"mm,mmm,mm, boop!  There you go, here's my takeÂ on Grace's illustration."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,541840,548720,"I love, I can't really speak enoughÂ about how much I really love this drawing  and I won't tell you how old this person is"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,548720,555360,"but it should blow you away, tell you that much.  Anyway, I'll send that off to you, Grace  and let's move on to another one."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,556000,560880,"Alright, now this next one wasÂ drawn by Emily, look at it, it's me."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,561600,567040,"This one actually came overÂ a year ago but I love it  and I when I wanted to redraw things,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,567040,573279,I instantly had knew I was going to do this one  but this is me as a medieval fantasy character.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,573280,580720,"Look how well the hair color is.  Anyway, it's beautiful, it's very well done.  I love that Emily is in character design."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,580720,586400,I'm not entirely sure how I want to draw this.  I think they used watercolor on that and marker.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,586400,593279,"Oh they said the colors they used, too, perfect.  Let me go ahead and find all these."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,593280,599840,"Alright, so I found ones I could.  I do not have some of these.  For some reason I don't have a Y11 and I don't know what that is."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,599840,605120,"I think it's warm gray 03,Â so I did something similar.  Yeah, I got out some of theÂ colors, that should do me."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,605120,610400,Oh what I'm missing is the hair color.  So we'll just go with these and uhÂ it'll use potato brown for the hair.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,610400,616240,"Let's grab mine, do I wanna um sketch out something?  I'm gonna use this sheet of paper."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,616880,623520,Do I want to do this sort of pose?  I might have to just keep it allÂ in this kind of simpler style.  I kind of just want to draw a bunch of things.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,623520,631040,"I don't really feel like spendingÂ forever on one, you know what I mean?  I love this pose.  Oh, so freaking beautiful, look at that hair."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,631040,638960,I don't really have bangsÂ anymore but it's been a year  so I'll forgive you.  A little synch in waist there with some jewelry.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,638960,644400,"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.  And then this cool belt with a side purse."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,644400,650720,"Oh so cool, oh I've got a freaking sword.  A little swirl of stars."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,650720,657360,"Gonna follow that Pocahontas hair.  Hey, alright, that's kindÂ of what I'm gonna go for.  I'm going to simplify the style a lot."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,657360,661839,This was a very complicated andÂ detailed and beautiful style  and I'm not going to replicate that.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,662480,670960,Alright figure out where the head goes.  Make sure they're looking up and majestically.  This outfit reminds me a lot ofÂ Renee Violet's D&D character.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,670960,675920,"Like I have that like cover of a movieÂ poster, half open mouth, cool epic pose."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,677280,683600,Basically the same pose as the last one.  A little different and thisÂ hand is gonna be on the sword
ex1V3hsi_Nc,683600,689360,and this arms over here and we'reÂ gonna have that little swoosh of stars.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,690320,695519,"Try shrinking the head just a little bit.  I don't mind if it's like big but thatÂ might be, it's a little overkill."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,698400,703120,"This looks nothing like me, thatÂ looks more like me, good job, Emily."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,706240,712320,Just nice bangs..  There's this like belt thing hereÂ and then there's the side belt
ex1V3hsi_Nc,712320,721840,or the hip belt I mean with the sword on it.  That skirt kind of opens upÂ in the front for more mobility
ex1V3hsi_Nc,721840,728000,"and there's a little front skirt piece and boots.  There we go, let's try it out."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,728000,736400,"Now, I don't have every colorÂ but we can start with some.  Looks like R11 is this inside bitÂ which looks way darker on my paper"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,736400,741863,but we'll give it a go  and it's gonna look lighter next toÂ the dark color we put next to it obviously.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,744034,749760,"Nice cuff, great,Â that's it for that color.  Also I forgot the jewelry, wellÂ maybe I won't have jewelry, oops."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,754240,760540,"A little bit of this inside here, shadow.  brown."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,760540,763862,I'm thinking mahogany for the boots.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,772080,774880,"Think this was the skin, just guessing."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,778880,785200,"And this looks like blush.  Oh wait, this looks not like that at all.  I think it's powder pink, powder pink."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,785200,790000,"Look at my swatches, this is why youÂ swatch and hopefully you use them.  Pink ears, why not."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,790640,796880,Maybe some lips of some kind  and then I don't have the hair color  but I'm just going to goÂ ahead and use potato brown
ex1V3hsi_Nc,796880,803760,even though that looks more accurate.  I gotta figure out if I have a uh Y11 somewhere.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,803760,809600,That's a really good hair color for me.  There's my attempt at majestic hair.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,809600,813840,"Let's add little wisps, I think that'll help.  And eyebrows."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,815280,822480,"Okay, it's going along, it's coming along.  I think they put a gray over topÂ of the purple and that darker one."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,825520,834320,"This might look good for likeÂ these little magic particles  and a lighter gray, too, maybe.   Draw very dainty littleÂ stars with this chunky marker."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,834320,837020,"Let's do some line art, start with the eyes."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,842960,848160,"Here's my movie poster mouth.  Oh we need freckles, what should I use for that?"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,849920,855840,Sparkle freckles.  Now this is where I'm not sure where the lines go.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,855840,864560,"I just have to figure it out.  And this little pouch, I keep looking back at this"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,864560,871760,and realizing how much moreÂ detailed it is than mine  and I'm just like maybe I shouldÂ have done something more similar
ex1V3hsi_Nc,871760,876080,"instead of this goofy style I didÂ it in but alas, too late now."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,878800,883840,"Is that it? Did I just finish this?  Oh I want to add in the sparklyÂ bits, see how that little glitter."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,884640,889839,Add in that so it's on allÂ of the light purple stuff.  It looks like it's glittery.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,889840,894880,I concentrate a lot of it in small places.  I feel like that helps things look glittery.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,894880,901920,"Obviously, if it's in shadow,Â there's gonna be less of the glitter.  I want to color in this, I don't likeÂ the fact that there's a bare leg,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,901920,909760,"it just looks odd to me, I'mÂ gonna go in with the skin.  Now the hair color and go overÂ that with cool gray, nope."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,909760,916560,"Maybe and then I could probably go over it  with the mahogany for aÂ little shadow here, yeah, yes."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,919840,926080,"I'm just gonna add these in lineÂ art so they're more obvious.  Alright, I don't feel like IÂ did this one so much justice"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,926080,931360,"but there she is, me I guess.  I do like it, there's parts I like about it,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,931360,940503,"there's parts I don't likeÂ about it so much but it's okay  because we've got more we can do.  Alright, this next one spokeÂ to me because it's color I don't usually use."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,940503,947440,"Green and I love plaid skirts.  Well it's not really plaid,Â I think it's called checks.  Anyway, I really like this,Â I love the colors of it."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,947440,953839,I even like how the paper is slightlyÂ yellow but this was drawn by Kayla  and I'd like to give it a shot myself.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,954640,960399,"I really like Kayla's style with the like no faces  and then the um, outfit designs."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,960400,965840,They actually included quite a few of them  but this is the one that spoke to me  so I'm gonna try and do something similar.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,965840,972000,"I don't know, I might draw aÂ face just because that's my vibe  but we'll see, they did not includeÂ the colors so that's up to me."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,972000,978960,"Let's see what we got, do I wantÂ to draw legs on mine? I don't know.  I love this hair, so curly looking."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,979600,987840,"We could do like a torso then I don'tÂ have to make up my mind about that.  Yeah, yeah, what if I justÂ do like looking downwards"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,987840,993840,and we could do that big hairÂ on a piece of hair on that side.  Oh and those sleeves are really cool.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,993840,1000880,"Alright so it's like a, what would you call that?  It's not sleeveless, it's justÂ like got the shoulders visible"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1000880,1007760,"then there's two straps and this is likeÂ tucked into the waistline, very hippy."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1007760,1013680,"Add lots of hips, I don't know why I said that like that.  If we pull it up a littleÂ higher, we'll get to add some legs."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1013680,1021520,"This, I feel like would lookÂ really good with like, uh  hand on the hip, then we obviously haveÂ the shirt that's really long like that."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1021520,1028880,"I just want to make sure it looksÂ like there's a hand in there.  Honestly, you know it would look really nice  although I didn't really drawÂ the pose properly for this."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1028880,1034240,If I brought this shoulderÂ up and put the hand here  and then you could see like the hangy bit.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1035520,1043920,"Is there a way I can do this, I'd have to bring this whole thing up.  You have a little flappy shirt like that."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1043920,1048960,"I feel like that's really fun, theÂ problem is this shoulder thing,  I don't know if you've everÂ worn one of these shirts"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1048960,1055760,"but as soon as you put yourÂ arms up, it changes shape  and it's just not the same.  Oh this would actually literallyÂ just kind of come up like this"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1055760,1063039,"and look like a one shoulder, you know.  This one so far has been my favorite,  I don't know if it's because IÂ didn't do a little pre-sketch"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1063040,1070800,"so I'm like giving it my all from the get-go.  I will need this like design, it looksÂ like it's in white gel pen of some kind."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1070800,1077040,"Beautiful, I think that's it.  Okay, now I just gotta find the colors.  Oh is that right? I feel like I needÂ something slightly lighter than that."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1078560,1086800,"No, that's too yellow, I might just use mahogany  but I will need this skin tone likeÂ it could be this, nope it's not that."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1086800,1092160,"I'm gonna try burnt siennaÂ maybe, closer but it's too brown."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1092160,1096800,This is more of a cooler skin tone.  Let me try this one.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1097680,1104960,"Oh no, that's really warm actually.  I'll try my Copic marker, that'sÂ very close to the wire, 92."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1104960,1111200,"Though back to this, althoughÂ as they dry, I'm thinking YR95."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1111200,1115039,"Let's go ahead and do that, let'sÂ color in the hair after all that work."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1116560,1124400,"Okay theirs was a little redder than mine.  Ah being attacked, try goingÂ over it with this terracotta."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1124400,1130400,"Oh that's pretty good, I definitely don'tÂ want terracotta just from the get-go.  I think we'll layer them together,Â that way it's a little orangier,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1130400,1135840,"a little warmer, I guess isÂ the proper way to say that."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1139920,1147840,"Yeah, that's working, I'm gonnaÂ use a thicker line art for this  since it's like more stylized, you know,  so I'm gonna use this zero eightÂ for the eyelashes at least."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1147840,1154240,"Now this tends to blend, so I'mÂ not sure if this is a good idea  and by blend I mean bleed out whenÂ I try to put colors on top of it"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1154240,1160320,"and we will see, very stylized.  Oh I don't know why I did the nose like that.  Ah, send help, why am I doing all this line art."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1160320,1166240,"No, I just said it tends to bleed out.  Let's do a spot that I don'tÂ really have to worry about  because there's no line art over here"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1166240,1170559,"and that's the shoulder,Â there's some skin down here"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1171600,1175360,and I gotta do this face andÂ hopefully everything turns out.  Let's just be very careful.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1176640,1181680,"Alright, alright, I might add a little blushÂ with the terracotta just to warm it up."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1181680,1189760,"We got some lips, okay, they kindÂ of just bleed it out into a circle.  Alright, we'll leave that for now.  Now I need to find this green colorÂ which I don't use my greens a lot"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1189760,1195200,"so I don't actually know.  That looks pretty good, hey I'm doing well."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1195200,1200240,"Try this, I mean maybe when it dries,Â it needs to be a little bit bluer."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1200240,1205360,"Maybe not that,  ew, get out of here.  I think G5 was closer."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1205360,1208240,I'm pretty happy with the other colorsÂ so let's go ahead and add those in.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1212960,1220640,"Okay, keep in mind the flow ofÂ the fabric is what I try to do  because if you're gonna have streaksÂ anyway, they might as well be useful."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1222480,1227840,"This color for the, I don'tÂ know, straps here and the belt"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1229360,1235120,"and then it's like a really bluish green.  Let's see how they've dried, weÂ might go with this one, vivid green."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1235120,1242640,"It's not quite the right color but IÂ also don't want to be swatching all day,  I'll be honest and most of myÂ other greens are green yellows"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1242640,1251040,"which are going to be too warmÂ and we want a cool green for this  so we'll just go ahead and use this,Â hopefully there'll be a pattern on this"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1251040,1256559,"and a little uh, purposeful shading.  Do I want to use this for like shading in here?"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1256560,1261840,"I don't know if that was the right idea.  Oh that's not even the right green, oh shoot."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1263440,1266559,"Well it's line art time, it's lineÂ art, oh wait, I need this like yellow."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1269120,1275840,"Not that either, that blue.  Okay, now we can do line art."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1277280,1279520,"Little chin, I also want to add some lips."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1284640,1287430,Then add the ribbed texture.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1291440,1293840,"We also have to add in a littleÂ white stripe on there, too."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1296800,1303120,"Yeah, yeah, is that it?  Oh you have to add the white, white, white.  I literally just said that. IÂ really like this kind of vibe."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1303120,1308480,I wonder if I could do it more in my style.  Kayla's has a really coolÂ like anime sort of influence.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1308480,1315040,"Okay, mine's not turning the right color,  maybe because mine was drawn soÂ long ago or colored in so long ago."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1315040,1318640,"A little juicy highlight,Â add in this texture here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1320320,1323039,Oh I like it with just the vertical stripes.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1327280,1333200,"That looks cool, I love that texture.  Supposed to be like a white stripe here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1333200,1342880,"I think that might be it, I'mÂ liking the terracotta blush,  it's starting to stand out a little better  but I think that is it unless I wantÂ to try and go over these highlights."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1342880,1350720,"Just terracotta kind of make itÂ look closer to the reference.  Alright, that's Kayla's design in my style."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1350720,1355919,"I'm really happy with thisÂ one, when I saw it I was like  oh, I just really want to draw that.  I am very happy with this."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1355920,1362720,"Oh, you know what might be funÂ adding a little green eyeshadow.  Ooh but then add a little glitter to it"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1363600,1371360,"and then when that dries go overÂ that with the green as well.  One second, there we go, does that look like eyeshadow."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1371360,1377200,"Oh you know what I did forget,Â that ribbed texture up here,  how did I manage that? I love this stuff."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1377200,1387039,"There we go.  Alright, I've got one more for you  and let me show you what that one is.  This one's drawn by Aubrey and it's kindÂ of the reason I'm making this video."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1387040,1393120,"I gotta be honest.  Boom, look at it, isn't it just theÂ most prettiest purpliest pop star"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1393120,1399279,looking chick on the planet?  So let's grab one last piece of paper.  I'm probably still gonna draw it in my goofy style
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1399280,1405360,"since uh, we've done that so much.  Well the last one was a littleÂ bit of a different style,  I'm not gonna go in there because I don't know,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1405360,1411919,that seems to like throw things off a little bit.  I did salvage the first one butÂ why not just go right on in there.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1411920,1416720,"Let's do another full body.  I'm gonna try and do a similar pose,  maybe have them looking off to the left."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1417440,1422640,Let's draw the whole thing so we know it fits.  Okay she's kind of got herÂ hips sticking out like this.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1422640,1427840,I'm exaggerating it if you can't tell.  Then this legs kind of coming out that way
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1427840,1433200,and this leg's coming back like this  and then both the hands around the hips.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1433840,1439040,"I'm going to turn the head aÂ little bit but not like that,  I want it to be looking more upwards."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1440640,1447840,"She's also got purple lips.  People are doing yard work,  that's gonna be a constantÂ for the next four months."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1447840,1455040,I hope you enjoy that.  Do we want them looking up or not?  I like that face because it's doing aÂ little squish the lips to the side thing
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1455040,1463120,"and mine is not, so yep, we got it, redo!  Let's do it more similar to theÂ reference, little lips to the side."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1463120,1471120,Aubrey's looks a little happier soÂ maybe we should try and replicate that.  That center part not sureÂ how big we'll be doing that
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1471120,1477600,"but there's a little something, hands on the hips.  Ooh these are some good hands, good job."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1479840,1486080,"Okay mine looks a little short,Â I like how tall this one is  although I suppose my styleÂ is to draw very short people"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1486080,1492480,"but I don't want it this time.  There's like that high waistedÂ pant, too, kind of mom jean cut."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1492480,1498080,I think what it is is these arms are kind of wide  which is making the body lookÂ shorter disproportionately.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1498800,1506400,"Alright, I think we're working somewhere here.  Pockets, we need all these rips,Â big knee holes, knee windows,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1507120,1513840,platform boots which I did not leave room for.  A little shadow under the pants and that top.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1514560,1522240,"I'm not sure how it stays on but IÂ can draw it, I don't have to wear it.  I'll just have to draw it.  I think the weakest part rightÂ now is the face and the hands."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1522240,1527360,Go ahead and redo those.  Try our rectangle square trick.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1527360,1533600,"Thumb would be coming out that way.  We have finger, let's see if I canÂ just lightly erase it, sketch on top."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1533600,1541200,"I love all the makeup on the face,Â that looks really fun to draw.  Just checks off a lot of boxes thatÂ I like in my guilty pleasure art."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1541200,1549840,"Thick eyelashes, big eyeballs.  Although, lately, I've beenÂ drawing really small eyeballs, so.  Eyebrows, I'm gonna tryÂ and get some ears in here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1549840,1555840,"There's some uh, hair goingÂ in front which could be fun.  I'm just not sure where I'd wantÂ to put it, put it in front here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1556400,1561760,Let's go ahead and cover likeÂ half the side of the face  and all the little divots there.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1561760,1569997,"We'll kind of close that up a little.  I like this one, I guess this earsÂ getting covered though,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1569997,1577760,"Goodbye ear it was nice knowing youÂ and this ear, too.  Actually, I drew quite a few years today,Â so I think my quota is filled."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1577760,1584000,Alrighty now I just have to add some color.  Although I have to swatch andÂ figure out what colors these are.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1584000,1589600,I noticed these were all marker illustrations.  That's probably why I felt drawn toÂ draw them because I love markers.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1589600,1598400,"Well Aubrey, we will figure out theseÂ colors, I'll tell you that much.  Let's grab our swatch card.  I think we can use P4 for theÂ boots and the hair shading"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1599040,1603200,and R11 for the hair and then weÂ need this more eggplanty color.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1607200,1614615,"Too light.  How about aubergine?  That's like exactly what I feel like.  Nope!  There she, is that it?"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1614800,1624000,"That's got to be it, right?  For skin, it looks like I had it butÂ I don't know what that was.  R19, R19 and then R20 maybe for the blush."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1625280,1628640,"Okay, I think that's all the colors.  Oh we also need a shading."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1630320,1637760,"Alright, I think we're good,Â we're ready, we're ready.  I think I'll start with skin toneÂ which I have estimated is barely beige."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1637760,1642960,"Oh I wanted to address something.  So, oh, there's a color it's called barely beige"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1642960,1648720,and then there's a Copic marker whichÂ I also called barely beige right here
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1648720,1655679,"but if you look, it's actually called barley beige  and I kind of wonder ifÂ Ohuhu made that same mistake"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1655680,1663600,"and they were kind of copyingÂ the name color, I don't know,  I have no proof, just that I'veÂ literally been using this marker  for probably four or five yearsÂ and I've always called it,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1663600,1669120,"even on video, barely beige but it's barley.  Okay I'm distracted, barely beige."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1673840,1678960,"Let's do blush because I, IÂ just need to do a little blush,  just feel it in my soul."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1680800,1684560,"Okay, looking good, looking good.  Let's color in the hair for the first layer."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1687680,1693760,"I'm gonna try the hair or the eyebrows, excuse me.  Yeah, I like them in purple, I'mÂ actually gonna leave that open"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1693760,1698640,"so I can blend out these like roots, itÂ looks like which we need lavender for."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1701360,1706720,"Oh and then these little little flips ofÂ hair, my hair doesn't look as uh, vibrant."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1706720,1712799,"I feel like it's probably because of the pink.  Oh I could actually, hmm, I think IÂ have a nice purple pen that would work."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1712800,1718400,It's the pentel ener-gel in the size zero seven  and I've noticed I can useÂ markers on top of them really well
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1718400,1723840,"so I could have done this first but let'sÂ try it for the hair line art, you know."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1726960,1736240,"For now, I just want to see what that look like.  Let's finish coloring in all this stuff.  We gotta do our top and we need theÂ purple pen for a little bow here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1736240,1742960,"Oh and this color was the boot  and then the lighter color for the, I don't know, the platform,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1743520,1751360,"there's definitely a word for thatÂ part of the shoe, bottom of the shoe.  I'm gonna go ahead and do the eyebrowsÂ with this to make them darker."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1751360,1759245,Oh that's also the lips.  Once the line art is there.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1759245,1763679,"Alright, where do we want to put this?  Oh did I want to erase, otherwiseÂ they end up looking very pink."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1764320,1770320,"Alright, so shadow, shadow,Â shadow, it's pretty good.  I think it's time for some line art."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1770320,1775120,I really like the thick line art on the last one.  Let's do the eyeballs.  I'm gonna go over top of the hair.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1775680,1779840,"These are really big eyes, I don't know,"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1781520,1787352,"maybe if I draw on the nose with black  because right now it's theÂ only thing that's black.  There we go, it's kind ofÂ pulled it together a little bit."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1796000,1802945,Oh that was too big but we canÂ add some highlights to the boots.  I'm gonna go to a smaller line art maybe.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1802945,1809200,"We'll do the rippies.  Basically, we need to go aroundÂ all the outside edge of it  and this guy up here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1811200,1816960,"Now, what I'm thinking is  we should add some more shadingÂ around the outside edges of this"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1816960,1822800,and that should be shaded in gray becauseÂ you're only seeing pants behind it.  Gonna go around it with this.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1826240,1831600,Bring down these little highlights  and then I want to try grabbing the Posca pen
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1831600,1838559,and adding lines across thatÂ so it's like white fibers  instead of looking like black fibers texture.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1839520,1845299,"Is that it, did I just finish it?  Do we need a little line here and a little line here."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1845299,1850560,"Oh we got some more uh, glitter bits,  lots of them.  Oh and then I can sign it."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1850560,1857519,"There you go, there's our final redraw.  Thank you so much for sending me your art Aubrey,  this was so much fun."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1857520,1867200,"Should we bring in all of our art?  We had Aubrey's art, Kayla'sÂ art, Emily's and Grace."
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1867200,1873520,This was so much fun.  Thanks for requesting that I redraw your art Grace  because that was another bigÂ reason I filmed it at all.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1873520,1881280,"Yeah, thank you guys so much for watching  and coming along with me asÂ I redrew some of your art,  it was really fun doing like aÂ little collab together in a way"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1881280,1886960,"and honestly learning things, too  because I feel like you canÂ definitely get set in your ways  where you do the exact same thingÂ over and over and over again"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1886960,1894640,"and then when you see someone else's art,  you can say, oh that's aÂ different way to do something  or like, the way they highlighted that  or the way they drew thoseÂ eyelashes, it's really really fun"
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1894640,1899679,and I think it's important toÂ not get too stuck in your ways  and to definitely explore other people's art.
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1899680,1904701,"Thank you guys for watching,Â I'll see you guys all next week  and I hope you have a deliciousÂ evening full of waffles,Â Â "
ex1V3hsi_Nc,1904701,1925624,bye!  ðŸŽµ
