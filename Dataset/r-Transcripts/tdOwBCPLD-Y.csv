tdOwBCPLD-Y,81119,83759,back hello you talented creators stop
tdOwBCPLD-Y,83759,85439,there you need to select another
tdOwBCPLD-Y,85439,87040,youtuber it doesn't necessarily have to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,87040,90000,be an art youtuber oh just someone you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,90000,92640,think could get creative with this art
tdOwBCPLD-Y,92640,95360,oh this is so amazing thanks peter so
tdOwBCPLD-Y,95360,97840,obviously i have no clue where to start
tdOwBCPLD-Y,97840,99200,we need to talk about the wood panel if
tdOwBCPLD-Y,99200,100479,you're familiar with my channel you know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,100479,102240,that i do color pencil drawings in
tdOwBCPLD-Y,102240,104000,sketchbooks i've always wanted to draw
tdOwBCPLD-Y,104000,106799,on word so it's something that i might
tdOwBCPLD-Y,106799,108399,have to play around with but i'll have
tdOwBCPLD-Y,108399,110079,to test out to see if it works i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,110079,112079,trying to imagine and trying to go off
tdOwBCPLD-Y,112079,114399,of what he did obviously i'm thinking of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,114399,116320,going down here that might not be
tdOwBCPLD-Y,116320,118000,obvious but i can't imagine just doing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,118000,119439,something up here
tdOwBCPLD-Y,119439,121920,um i could maybe even go
tdOwBCPLD-Y,121920,123920,over here but it's like how does this
tdOwBCPLD-Y,123920,126079,turn into a cohesive piece at the end i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,126079,127920,don't know maybe someone that he's
tdOwBCPLD-Y,127920,129920,walking with through this forest thing i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,129920,131599,don't know i don't know okay time to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,131599,133599,start experimenting first i'm gonna take
tdOwBCPLD-Y,133599,135599,a picture of the canvas on my ipad and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,135599,137680,i'm really just gonna stare at it until
tdOwBCPLD-Y,137680,141159,inspiration comes
tdOwBCPLD-Y,142000,143680,down i'm going to be so honest with you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,143680,144879,and see it's been about two weeks since
tdOwBCPLD-Y,144879,146480,i last looked at this wood panel i have
tdOwBCPLD-Y,146480,149040,been stuck on ideas initially looking at
tdOwBCPLD-Y,149040,150560,the blue of the background i was like oh
tdOwBCPLD-Y,150560,152319,what if i do someone that's kind of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,152319,154000,underwater half of her face being
tdOwBCPLD-Y,154000,155920,submerged and you know then we get the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,155920,158480,blues coming out honestly waterwear
tdOwBCPLD-Y,158480,160160,because his blue background is very
tdOwBCPLD-Y,160160,162319,abstract i really like the contrast that
tdOwBCPLD-Y,162319,163920,it brings to the rest of the piece but
tdOwBCPLD-Y,163920,166319,to not link it to water it's not really
tdOwBCPLD-Y,166319,168480,giving so now i'm thinking about the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,168480,170640,armor you know the helmet and the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,170640,172800,warrior i don't know what you call it
tdOwBCPLD-Y,172800,175280,shield breastplate i don't know but now
tdOwBCPLD-Y,175280,176640,looking at that that's giving me the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,176640,179120,vibe of a protector where's he going
tdOwBCPLD-Y,179120,180800,what's he protecting what's that bird
tdOwBCPLD-Y,180800,182080,saying and then we've got some of the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,182080,183840,greens around him in the background and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,183840,185599,now i'm like okay so maybe they're in
tdOwBCPLD-Y,185599,187680,the forest and i could do the whole idea
tdOwBCPLD-Y,187680,190159,of someone hiding behind some leaves i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,190159,191360,like the vibe of that and if you're
tdOwBCPLD-Y,191360,192959,familiar with my channel you know i love
tdOwBCPLD-Y,192959,194560,drawing women so i could just imagine
tdOwBCPLD-Y,194560,196800,the vibe of a woman hiding behind some
tdOwBCPLD-Y,196800,199040,leaves and this man hunt
tdOwBCPLD-Y,199040,201440,hunter in and this man tried to find her
tdOwBCPLD-Y,201440,202959,trying to protect her trainer i don't
tdOwBCPLD-Y,202959,204319,know the story
tdOwBCPLD-Y,204319,206400,but i really like this vibe this is the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,206400,208080,exploration stage just play around with
tdOwBCPLD-Y,208080,209440,ideas so i've just gone into pinterest
tdOwBCPLD-Y,209440,211200,and i've added a few things to my boards
tdOwBCPLD-Y,211200,213120,and you can see the vibe of you know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,213120,215280,mostly leaves and then you see somewhat
tdOwBCPLD-Y,215280,217280,a face i really love this idea of the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,217280,219200,colorful leaves so like bring in extra
tdOwBCPLD-Y,219200,221519,colors so it's not just green all of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,221519,223200,those blues are really coming through i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,223200,224799,really love that and i just love the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,224799,226720,idea of you know just forest behind and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,226720,229120,then a striking person that has a really
tdOwBCPLD-Y,229120,230799,nice contrast i think that would be
tdOwBCPLD-Y,230799,233280,great this one with the eye is sick
tdOwBCPLD-Y,233280,234959,imagine there is such a detailed eye and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,234959,236560,then a leaf but with the composition
tdOwBCPLD-Y,236560,238799,we've got and with what 100 started i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,238799,240640,don't think i can just put an eye inside
tdOwBCPLD-Y,240640,242560,maybe i could i don't know so pinterest
tdOwBCPLD-Y,242560,243840,has been really really great for idea
tdOwBCPLD-Y,243840,245920,generation and i found two images that i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,245920,248080,really really loved so i've gone into
tdOwBCPLD-Y,248080,249920,photoshop so i've got this first image
tdOwBCPLD-Y,249920,251120,and we've just got the lady and she's
tdOwBCPLD-Y,251120,253040,kind of peeking through some leaves i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,253040,255120,love that vibe in the bottom right and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,255120,256720,the second option is of this person
tdOwBCPLD-Y,256720,259040,hiding behind some leaves and the back
tdOwBCPLD-Y,259040,263199,definition the skin tone the contrast
tdOwBCPLD-Y,263199,264800,not gonna lie i'm feeling this one more
tdOwBCPLD-Y,264800,266320,so i've gone ahead to ask my patrons
tdOwBCPLD-Y,266320,267600,which one are you feeling more of the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,267600,269520,vibe and my patrons came through pizza
tdOwBCPLD-Y,269520,271600,belly says i'm more drawn to two myself
tdOwBCPLD-Y,271600,273280,i love how the leaves don't overtake the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,273280,275759,character bulma says i'm more drawn to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,275759,277280,number two i feel like it's more
tdOwBCPLD-Y,277280,279280,balanced between the foliage and the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,279280,281919,model also i like the model is showing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,281919,284080,more skin and you see the gorgeous rich
tdOwBCPLD-Y,284080,286479,browns next to the cool green leaves i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,286479,287600,don't know what i'm talking about though
tdOwBCPLD-Y,287600,289199,yes you do because that sounds awesome
tdOwBCPLD-Y,289199,291040,and that's exactly the vibe i'm going
tdOwBCPLD-Y,291040,292400,for now i need to figure out where i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,292400,294000,going to find my actual reference from i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,294000,295440,used pinterest initially because it
tdOwBCPLD-Y,295440,297040,works so well for initial idea
tdOwBCPLD-Y,297040,299120,exploration it gives you other images
tdOwBCPLD-Y,299120,300960,that's very similar and along the same
tdOwBCPLD-Y,300960,303120,length so it helps to just get the ideas
tdOwBCPLD-Y,303120,305600,flowing i still struggle as an artist do
tdOwBCPLD-Y,305600,307520,you have to use a copyright free website
tdOwBCPLD-Y,307520,309280,or can you just use any reference
tdOwBCPLD-Y,309280,310800,because technically it's going to be
tdOwBCPLD-Y,310800,312000,made in my own style and it's going to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,312000,313759,be an amalgamation of a lot of things
tdOwBCPLD-Y,313759,315280,i'm not sure i'm going to have a look on
tdOwBCPLD-Y,315280,316720,some of those copyright free websites to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,316720,318160,see if i can find an image that kind of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,318160,320320,fits the vibe if not oh should i take a
tdOwBCPLD-Y,320320,321919,picture of my own
tdOwBCPLD-Y,321919,323680,no honestly it's not everyday helpful
tdOwBCPLD-Y,323680,324630,trick
tdOwBCPLD-Y,324630,334560,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,334560,336960,two hours later it has taken me a while
tdOwBCPLD-Y,336960,338560,to be able to find a reference because
tdOwBCPLD-Y,338560,340479,honestly i was just in love with this
tdOwBCPLD-Y,340479,343039,image i just love the colors the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,343039,345919,vibrancy the composition honestly this
tdOwBCPLD-Y,345919,347919,reference was perfect for the vision i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,347919,349759,had and i emailed the photographer i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,349759,351759,dm'd her didn't hear anything back as an
tdOwBCPLD-Y,351759,353520,artist it's important to respect fellow
tdOwBCPLD-Y,353520,355199,artists so i needed to get her
tdOwBCPLD-Y,355199,356720,permission but it's all good i found a
tdOwBCPLD-Y,356720,358479,bunch of other photographs on copyright
tdOwBCPLD-Y,358479,360240,free website so i might end up having to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,360240,362319,do like an amalgamation of a few i like
tdOwBCPLD-Y,362319,364080,this one as the main subject it has a
tdOwBCPLD-Y,364080,366479,similar kind of vibe but i'll use
tdOwBCPLD-Y,366479,367919,greenery and other things from other
tdOwBCPLD-Y,367919,369600,pictures just to bring this whole thing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,369600,370560,together
tdOwBCPLD-Y,370560,372800,and this one is completely free to use
tdOwBCPLD-Y,372800,375120,the photographer anastasia is amazing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,375120,376800,she has other images with a similar
tdOwBCPLD-Y,376800,378720,style as well i'll link her pixels page
tdOwBCPLD-Y,378720,380800,down below but now i can finally start
tdOwBCPLD-Y,380800,382880,on this wood panel and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,382880,384240,this is where the nervousness comes in
tdOwBCPLD-Y,384240,387280,so 100 used acrylic paint on his part if
tdOwBCPLD-Y,387280,388639,you're familiar with my channel you know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,388639,390960,i love coloring pencils i've seen other
tdOwBCPLD-Y,390960,392720,people draw with color printers on woods
tdOwBCPLD-Y,392720,395039,i really want to try it i bought some
tdOwBCPLD-Y,395039,396639,wood slices and i'm just going to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,396639,398080,practice see how my coloring pencils
tdOwBCPLD-Y,398080,400080,work on this wood surface before i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,400080,401840,finally put it on the actual piece but
tdOwBCPLD-Y,401840,404130,first i probably need to gesso it
tdOwBCPLD-Y,404130,407520,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,407520,409759,a few moments later the gesso is
tdOwBCPLD-Y,409759,411280,completely dry now i'm gonna test my
tdOwBCPLD-Y,411280,413039,coloring pencils the three main ones i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,413039,414400,want to test are the prisma colors paper
tdOwBCPLD-Y,414400,416000,castell and caron dash the main
tdOwBCPLD-Y,416000,417280,difference between them is what is used
tdOwBCPLD-Y,417280,418800,in their binding agent so some are more
tdOwBCPLD-Y,418800,420880,waxy some of the more oil-based and this
tdOwBCPLD-Y,420880,422960,affects how nice they apply so some
tdOwBCPLD-Y,422960,425039,blend easier than others i have my
tdOwBCPLD-Y,425039,426400,favorites but i've never attempted to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,426400,428479,color on wood so i have no idea what to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,428479,430319,expect and now i'm just trying to see if
tdOwBCPLD-Y,430319,432160,i can get any blending on this gessoed
tdOwBCPLD-Y,432160,433759,surface i'm just doing the regular
tdOwBCPLD-Y,433759,435520,technique i've got quite a few videos on
tdOwBCPLD-Y,435520,437039,it on my channel i'll link one above and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,437039,439120,the blending seems to work okay but
tdOwBCPLD-Y,439120,441360,realistically will it work on the pre
tdOwBCPLD-Y,441360,443520,gesso panel 100 gave me i don't know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,443520,444560,it's like i don't want to ruin it i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,444560,445599,don't just want to go in and be like
tdOwBCPLD-Y,445599,447199,yeah i'm using pencils by force if it's
tdOwBCPLD-Y,447199,450560,not gonna work so i'm just gonna quickly
tdOwBCPLD-Y,450560,453440,and guys nothing is happening the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,453440,457039,surface feels so smooth it's too smooth
tdOwBCPLD-Y,457039,459520,oh my gosh i can't see any pigment the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,459520,461520,darker color is a little better but
tdOwBCPLD-Y,461520,464160,honestly this isn't it to be honest i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,464160,466000,not loving the finish of this i think
tdOwBCPLD-Y,466000,467120,i'm just gonna have to leave my colored
tdOwBCPLD-Y,467120,468319,pencils so i've bought some fluid
tdOwBCPLD-Y,468319,469840,acrylics i've never tried it before it's
tdOwBCPLD-Y,469840,471360,still sealed i guess you have to wait
tdOwBCPLD-Y,471360,472960,and see the painting portion but first
tdOwBCPLD-Y,472960,474560,to do our sketch
tdOwBCPLD-Y,474560,475919,if you're familiar with my channel you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,475919,478319,know i love sketching on loose paper and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,478319,479759,then i transfer the sketch when i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,479759,481280,ready i just need to figure out how big
tdOwBCPLD-Y,481280,483440,is going to be in relation to 100
tdOwBCPLD-Y,483440,485020,character
tdOwBCPLD-Y,485020,490740,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,491280,493680,now that i've got my basic sketch i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,493680,496160,reconsidering the position so obviously
tdOwBCPLD-Y,496160,497680,initially i said bottom right bottom
tdOwBCPLD-Y,497680,500080,right but now i'm like what if it goes
tdOwBCPLD-Y,500080,501440,in the middle and it's kind of next to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,501440,503440,the character but then because she's
tdOwBCPLD-Y,503440,505199,hiding why she's just hiding next to him
tdOwBCPLD-Y,505199,508160,he needs to find her right i don't know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,508160,509360,but i'm just going to stick to the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,509360,511280,bottom right so i'm using a graphite
tdOwBCPLD-Y,511280,513279,transfer sheet and it's a very simple
tdOwBCPLD-Y,513279,515599,technique of just using a biro and going
tdOwBCPLD-Y,515599,518000,over all of my sketch lines
tdOwBCPLD-Y,518000,519360,i love this technique always because you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,519360,520959,can make mistakes on your sketch and it
tdOwBCPLD-Y,520959,522959,can turn out as haggard as it needs to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,522959,525040,but you can just transfer the lines you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,525040,526560,actually want to keep
tdOwBCPLD-Y,526560,528880,and here is this get transferred okay
tdOwBCPLD-Y,528880,531040,it's done a bit of a shoddy job but i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,531040,532480,can still see the main proportion so i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,532480,534000,just quickly putting in the missing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,534000,535680,parts and then we can finally get to the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,535680,537279,painting
tdOwBCPLD-Y,537279,539600,so here are the paints i got it looks
tdOwBCPLD-Y,539600,541519,like a pretty nice selection of colors
tdOwBCPLD-Y,541519,543600,and how you know i don't paint a lot is
tdOwBCPLD-Y,543600,545200,this is the only palette i can find
tdOwBCPLD-Y,545200,547680,obviously the paint is dried onto the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,547680,549839,palette but here's a little bit of asmr
tdOwBCPLD-Y,549839,552080,for you
tdOwBCPLD-Y,558030,559680,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,559680,561200,i don't want to ruin what 100's got
tdOwBCPLD-Y,561200,562800,going on on this side so i'm just going
tdOwBCPLD-Y,562800,565440,to put my palette on this card and we
tdOwBCPLD-Y,565440,567680,can go i'm a bit nervous for the skin so
tdOwBCPLD-Y,567680,569279,i'm going to start with the background
tdOwBCPLD-Y,569279,570720,i'm going to try to match it a little
tdOwBCPLD-Y,570720,573920,bit to the blue the 100s used
tdOwBCPLD-Y,573920,574959,i'm going to be speeding through the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,574959,576560,painting process in this video but if
tdOwBCPLD-Y,576560,578160,you want to see the full thing you can
tdOwBCPLD-Y,578160,579920,head over to my patreon i've got an
tdOwBCPLD-Y,579920,581279,extended video which is a longer
tdOwBCPLD-Y,581279,583519,tutorial it's side by side i'm mixing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,583519,585519,all the colors and talking through the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,585519,587360,entire process and that's probably one
tdOwBCPLD-Y,587360,588640,of the best ways you can support me as
tdOwBCPLD-Y,588640,590240,an artist right now if you don't like
tdOwBCPLD-Y,590240,592160,tutorials i've got a bunch of other
tdOwBCPLD-Y,592160,594720,tiers with other goodies so feel free to
tdOwBCPLD-Y,594720,596320,check out my patreon and thank you for
tdOwBCPLD-Y,596320,598040,your support in advance
tdOwBCPLD-Y,598040,600080,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,600080,602399,for this piece i don't want a super
tdOwBCPLD-Y,602399,604320,blended look i want to keep it quite
tdOwBCPLD-Y,604320,606240,abstract i'm trying to bring in some of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,606240,608240,the colors that i can see on 100 side as
tdOwBCPLD-Y,608240,609279,well
tdOwBCPLD-Y,609279,611200,so he's got you know the oranges and the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,611200,613440,hair he's got some pinks he's got
tdOwBCPLD-Y,613440,615760,purples golds
tdOwBCPLD-Y,615760,617839,obviously mine is still a realistic
tdOwBCPLD-Y,617839,619839,style but i'm also keeping those colors
tdOwBCPLD-Y,619839,622160,in mind to keep it cohesive
tdOwBCPLD-Y,622160,623839,it is the next day and i'm not gonna lie
tdOwBCPLD-Y,623839,625360,to you i'm not loving how this is
tdOwBCPLD-Y,625360,626959,looking i left it overnight so i can
tdOwBCPLD-Y,626959,628560,really ponder on it i do like some of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,628560,629920,the colors i've got in the shoulders and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,629920,631200,then something i just realized i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,631200,633120,missing is in the first picture i wanted
tdOwBCPLD-Y,633120,634720,to do there were the leaves covering her
tdOwBCPLD-Y,634720,636399,face so there was this massive hidden
tdOwBCPLD-Y,636399,637839,element and i definitely don't have it
tdOwBCPLD-Y,637839,639440,with this one so i think the first thing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,639440,641200,i'm going to do is just try to draw some
tdOwBCPLD-Y,641200,643120,leaves that kind of match what 100 has
tdOwBCPLD-Y,643120,644959,done on his side and then i can have
tdOwBCPLD-Y,644959,646320,some leaves that are kind of covering
tdOwBCPLD-Y,646320,647839,some of the mess of the back but also
tdOwBCPLD-Y,647839,649279,acted in this hidden kind of format i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,649279,650800,was initially going for but yeah i think
tdOwBCPLD-Y,650800,652800,i'm ready to move on with this and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,652800,654079,i'm excited
tdOwBCPLD-Y,654079,656700,scared excited
tdOwBCPLD-Y,656700,659940,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,662040,666789,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,667920,669600,this leaves part was probably one of the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,669600,671440,most nerve-wracking for me because i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,671440,673680,not using a reference so i'm kind of
tdOwBCPLD-Y,673680,674800,guessing
tdOwBCPLD-Y,674800,676480,i don't know the names of leaves so i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,676480,678160,didn't even know what to search and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,678160,679760,anything i found wasn't really fit in
tdOwBCPLD-Y,679760,681200,the vibe
tdOwBCPLD-Y,681200,683040,but after i've got a few going honestly
tdOwBCPLD-Y,683040,684560,i'm not mad at it small small shadow and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,684560,686880,highlight and i'm actually liking this
tdOwBCPLD-Y,686880,688959,this might be my favorite part of the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,688959,690000,piece
tdOwBCPLD-Y,690000,691519,so i've added some more in this corner
tdOwBCPLD-Y,691519,693360,but i want to focus on adding some
tdOwBCPLD-Y,693360,694560,details because obviously we can't see
tdOwBCPLD-Y,694560,696399,her eyes or anything at the moment and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,696399,698160,that kind of scares me because i never
tdOwBCPLD-Y,698160,700560,do this backwards way of working where i
tdOwBCPLD-Y,700560,702240,add the detail last i usually add the
tdOwBCPLD-Y,702240,704240,detail as i go so i would never just
tdOwBCPLD-Y,704240,706240,block out colors and then bring detail
tdOwBCPLD-Y,706240,708720,from nowhere and i really admire artists
tdOwBCPLD-Y,708720,710800,that can manage to do that i'm loving
tdOwBCPLD-Y,710800,714440,how it's coming together
tdOwBCPLD-Y,717440,719440,at this point i'm just loving the actual
tdOwBCPLD-Y,719440,721600,painting process painting is locally
tdOwBCPLD-Y,721600,722800,therapeutic maybe i should do more
tdOwBCPLD-Y,722800,724320,painting videos on my channel so i'm
tdOwBCPLD-Y,724320,727279,feeling motivation for more leaves
tdOwBCPLD-Y,727279,728800,i'm just feeling like adding more and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,728800,730399,more leaves she's meant to be hidden
tdOwBCPLD-Y,730399,732480,right
tdOwBCPLD-Y,732480,734959,and with the finishing touches my first
tdOwBCPLD-Y,734959,738000,collab on youtube is done
tdOwBCPLD-Y,738000,740639,so we're finally done before i reveal
tdOwBCPLD-Y,740639,742320,the painting i'm sure you want to know
tdOwBCPLD-Y,742320,745920,who's next oh my gosh scared me well

tdOwBCPLD-Y,756399,760160,it on i'm ready for the challenge
tdOwBCPLD-Y,760639,762160,that's right it's christian from
tdOwBCPLD-Y,762160,764320,blackbean cms i'm a massive fan of his
tdOwBCPLD-Y,764320,766160,so i had to get him to jump on board and
tdOwBCPLD-Y,766160,770110,without further ado here is my painting
tdOwBCPLD-Y,770110,773279,[Music]
tdOwBCPLD-Y,773279,775519,this painting has been 100 out of my
tdOwBCPLD-Y,775519,777200,comfort zone the fact that it's even a
tdOwBCPLD-Y,777200,779120,painting and not a drawing i can't wait
tdOwBCPLD-Y,779120,780800,to see where this goes make sure you're
