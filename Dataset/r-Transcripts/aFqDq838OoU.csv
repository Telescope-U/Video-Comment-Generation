aFqDq838OoU,230799,232480,skips up there and the bases are loaded
aFqDq838OoU,232480,234640,with nobody out and that's going to be
aFqDq838OoU,234640,236080,the end of the line free and anderson
aFqDq838OoU,236080,238000,who will depart after walking four

aFqDq838OoU,243040,246959,braves faces chris taylor is the pitch
aFqDq838OoU,246959,249120,went that time
aFqDq838OoU,249120,251360,so a smart veteran pitch there from
aFqDq838OoU,251360,254480,colin mchugh on a 2-0 pitch
aFqDq838OoU,254480,256560,it's a bouncing ball to third riley the
aFqDq838OoU,256560,259680,second one onto first
aFqDq838OoU,259680,261680,off line and olson couldn't grab it and
aFqDq838OoU,261680,263840,so run scores
aFqDq838OoU,263840,265360,yeah that didn't look good from the get
aFqDq838OoU,265360,266400,going
aFqDq838OoU,266400,268720,maria struck harris out on three pitches
aFqDq838OoU,268720,272240,his first time and he do the same
aFqDq838OoU,272240,274880,yes he can with a high fastball
aFqDq838OoU,274880,277360,continues to dominate the braves mostly
aFqDq838OoU,277360,279199,with that heater down the line he'll
aFqDq838OoU,279199,281680,pick up an infield hit that's the second
aFqDq838OoU,281680,283360,knock of the game for the braves so
aFqDq838OoU,283360,286080,here's dansby he shoots this ball softly
aFqDq838OoU,286080,287680,toward right thompson on the run still
aFqDq838OoU,287680,289520,coming he's gonna dive he can't make the
aFqDq838OoU,289520,290479,play
aFqDq838OoU,290479,293040,and acuna is on his way to third he's
aFqDq838OoU,293040,294639,gonna stop there
aFqDq838OoU,294639,296639,atlanta's got into the corners with one
aFqDq838OoU,296639,299040,out two soft hits but we'll take him
aFqDq838OoU,299040,301440,austin riley is old for two two pitch
aFqDq838OoU,301440,305280,he's going it's ball four to load it
aFqDq838OoU,305280,308160,now the tying run comes to the plate
aFqDq838OoU,308160,310240,how ironic is it who's coming up to bat
aFqDq838OoU,310240,311280,too
aFqDq838OoU,311280,313360,the first baseman
aFqDq838OoU,313360,315280,matt olsen here with a chance to do some
aFqDq838OoU,315280,316320,damage
aFqDq838OoU,316320,318000,sling fly ball
aFqDq838OoU,318000,320240,shallow left center field that ball is
aFqDq838OoU,320240,322560,caught by taylor acuna will tag and
aFqDq838OoU,322560,324960,score the dodgers concede a run
aFqDq838OoU,324960,327440,it's a sacrifice fly and the braves are
aFqDq838OoU,327440,330320,on the board they get one two outs and
aFqDq838OoU,330320,333360,the designated hitter marcel ozuna who
aFqDq838OoU,333360,336560,has struck out twice two on two out one
aFqDq838OoU,336560,337520,two
aFqDq838OoU,337520,340320,he struck him out just as you said with
aFqDq838OoU,340320,342560,the high fast ball
aFqDq838OoU,342560,345039,marias limits the damage to just one
aFqDq838OoU,345039,347840,great stuff tonight from the lefty
aFqDq838OoU,347840,349919,so daniel hudson
aFqDq838OoU,349919,351840,makes his 25th appearance out of the
aFqDq838OoU,351840,354160,dodger bullpen he's two and three
aFqDq838OoU,354160,356240,three one from hudson

aFqDq838OoU,361440,364080,infield hit in the sixth inning
aFqDq838OoU,364080,365360,swinging but
aFqDq838OoU,365360,368639,that is a fair ball and a bad throw from
aFqDq838OoU,368639,371280,smith and down goes hudson in a heap
aFqDq838OoU,371280,372880,he's on his back in front of the
aFqDq838OoU,372880,375360,pitcher's mound hudson hurt himself
aFqDq838OoU,375360,377759,breaking off the mount as hudson's going
aFqDq838OoU,377759,380160,to have to be helped
aFqDq838OoU,380160,382160,to the dodger dugout with cruz dark
aFqDq838OoU,382160,385120,gradual so he will get as much time as
aFqDq838OoU,385120,387440,he needs to get loose on this hot night
aFqDq838OoU,387440,390080,dansby has not seen graterol
aFqDq838OoU,390080,391919,swinging a shot hit to left field that's
aFqDq838OoU,391919,394880,gonna get down for a base hit acuna is
aFqDq838OoU,394880,396960,going to fly toward third and he's going
aFqDq838OoU,396960,400000,to slide in safely and so the braves
aFqDq838OoU,400000,402400,bring the tiger onto the plate here we
aFqDq838OoU,402400,404639,go late inning magic for atlantis with
aFqDq838OoU,404639,406639,riley in the box austin oh for two of

aFqDq838OoU,411840,413919,second one onto first
aFqDq838OoU,413919,416160,that is a double play
aFqDq838OoU,416160,418800,bruce star gradual comes on and saves
aFqDq838OoU,418800,419759,the day
aFqDq838OoU,419759,422080,a 4-1 lead for la as we go to the bottom
aFqDq838OoU,422080,423759,of the ninth inning and craig kimbrell
aFqDq838OoU,423759,426160,comes in adam looking for his first hit
aFqDq838OoU,426160,428080,against the dodger pitching staff this
aFqDq838OoU,428080,430639,year he's over 15 including an over
