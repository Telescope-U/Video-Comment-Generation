yG7v4y_xwzQ,0,7000,Transcriber: Mohand Habchi Reviewer: Elisabeth Buffard
yG7v4y_xwzQ,13502,15018,"When we look at Olympic sport,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,15018,16514,"sport at the highest level,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,16514,19500,there are clearly some athletes  who always seem to get it right.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,19500,21251,"For example, Usain Bolt:"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,21251,24501,"Olympic 100m, 200m champion, twice over,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,24501,27765,in the 2008 Beijing Olympics  and in the London Olympics.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,27765,31748,Michael Phelps: the most bemedaled Olympian of all time.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,31748,33758,"These are athletes  who clearly get it right,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,33758,37537,both psychologically  and physiologically all of the time.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,38741,42780,It is also interesting to note that  they have contrasting approaches.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,42780,45750,"Usain Bolt, with all his comedy antics,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,45750,48275,"prior to his event,  when he is on the start line."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,48275,50534,We've all seen this. (Laughter)
yG7v4y_xwzQ,51493,54770,"Michael Phelps,  however, a much different approach."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,54770,57766,"He sits down, he is listening to music,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,57766,61250,"he has much more  cerebral, contemplative approach"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,61250,62784,towards his event.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,62784,65090,But it's both very effective.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,66251,70788,"Sport psychology may play a part in their preparation for their events,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,70788,73773,and maybe a reason  why they're successful.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,74499,76490,What happens when things go wrong?
yG7v4y_xwzQ,76490,78271,Here's another example.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,78272,82275,"In the 2012 Olympics in London in the soccer final,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,82275,85271,"there were two finalists,  Brazil and Mexico."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,85271,87494,Brazil were the undoubted favorites.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,87494,89237,They were expected to win.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,89237,91262,They were the reigning Olympic champions.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,91262,92784,"They were extremely skilled,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,92784,94766,"on paper, they were the best team."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,94766,97244,"Mexico had made it to the final playing well,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,97245,99304,but they were unfancied.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,99754,104073,"In the final, Mexico went at Brazil"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,104073,107091,in an incredible display of attacking football.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,107092,109053,It was incredibly impressive to watch.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,109053,111040,"And if you watched  the Brazilian players,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,111040,112236,their heads dropped.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,112236,114272,They seemed slightly defeated.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,114272,115492,They could not understand
yG7v4y_xwzQ,115492,117752,why they were not performing  quite as well as they were.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,117752,119501,Perhaps they were complacent.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,119501,123250,Perhaps they'd expected too much.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,123250,125249,Perhaps they were overconfident.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,125249,127062,"The Mexicans had nothing to lose,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,127062,128515,they attacked with fervor
yG7v4y_xwzQ,128516,130509,"and they won the Olympic title,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,130509,133754,they were the Olympic champions over the fancy favorites.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,134244,138755,Perhaps sport psychology  can explain why fancied champions
yG7v4y_xwzQ,138755,140764,may be over-confident
yG7v4y_xwzQ,140764,143751,"and may fail when they're expected to win,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,143751,146283,and perhaps why underdogs take on the best
yG7v4y_xwzQ,146283,149495,and win despite all the odds.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,150225,151768,Take another example.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,151768,153239,James Magnussen:
yG7v4y_xwzQ,153239,155760,a man with seemingly  unshakable self-confidence.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,155760,160500,He said he was going to win  the 100m-sprint final in the pool
yG7v4y_xwzQ,160500,162760,at the London Olympics.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,162760,164741,He was extremely confident.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,164742,165750,"But in that race,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,165750,169248,"he was out-touched in the line by Nathan Adrian,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,169738,171766,by 1/100 of a second.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,171766,173263,"And that was devastating for him,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,173263,176506,"you could see his body language after, he was destroyed."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,176506,178763,Perhaps he was over-confident.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,178763,181880,"Perhaps though,  his obvious confidence"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,181880,185751,in the events leading up  to the actual final.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,185751,190757,Perhaps his confidence belied an undelying self low confidence.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,190757,193545,Perhaps he was not  very confident inside
yG7v4y_xwzQ,193545,197053,when he should have been supremely confident of his abilities
yG7v4y_xwzQ,197053,200502,because he was the world leader in the event.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,200503,203261,"So perhaps psychology  may have played a part,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,203261,205529,"but in particular,  it may help"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,205529,209527,when overcoming such a devastating defeat for the next event.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,210237,213258,Another very good example: Roy McAvoy.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,213258,217252,"In the 2011 Augusta masters,  he was expected to win,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,217252,219272,"he was amongst the favorites certainly,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,219272,221042,and he's an extremely talented golfer.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,221042,225524,"In fact, he is the one player that all the people on the tour,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,225524,227749,"all the golfers on the tour, the PGA tour,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,227749,229280,fear the most.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,229761,230756,"And yet on the day,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,230756,233757,"when he was leading, on the final day of the event"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,233757,235499,he was leading by four shots.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,235499,237750,He'd played superbly on the previous three days.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,237751,241533,He experienced  a catastrophic drop in his performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,241533,243259,"He shot a round of 80,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,243259,245745,and this is something  that professional golfers
yG7v4y_xwzQ,245745,249248,"can do in their sleep, certainly very easily,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,249498,253501,because they frequently shoot rounds of 70 or below
yG7v4y_xwzQ,253501,255257,and that's a good shot.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,255257,257773,"So 80 was a catastrophic failure,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,257773,260329,and he ended up tying for fifteenth place.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,261515,263760,So you'd think that  that sort of devastating performance
yG7v4y_xwzQ,263760,266495,may have impacted on his mind.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,266495,270512,"However, only eight weeks later, he won the U.S open,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,270512,273516,and there was no sign  of the lack of confidence
yG7v4y_xwzQ,273516,275759,"and the fact that the pressure  had got to him,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,275760,278769,that was displayed  when he was in Augusta.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,278769,280752,So it seemed that he picked up the pieces.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,280752,283280,And what is it that made him do so?
yG7v4y_xwzQ,283280,285523,Sport psychology  may indeed have the answers.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,286215,288503,"So, elite athletes, coaches,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,288503,290261,"and the people who surround athletes,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,290261,292741,"know very well the importance  of sport psychology,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,292741,294519,and they're beginning to embrace it.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,294519,296750,Sport psychologists are often included
yG7v4y_xwzQ,296750,299271,in the teams  that surround athletes nowadays.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,300251,301754,What is sport psychology?
yG7v4y_xwzQ,301754,306510,"Well, it is the science,  study and practice"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,306510,308769,of mental preparation for sport.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,309738,312513,It involves identifying  the techniques and strategies
yG7v4y_xwzQ,312513,314508,"that athletes can take and use,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,314508,317492,so they perform on their most optimum.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,317493,320998,"It also helps athletes deal  with come back, with setbacks"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,320998,324240,and help them to come back from devastating defeats.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,324240,328244,Such as those by James Magnussen or Roy McAvoy.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,328244,331779,So we just begin to unpack some of these strategies
yG7v4y_xwzQ,331779,334494,that sport psychologists talk about.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,334494,336499,"So looking inside of the mind of a winner,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,336499,339509,what factors are linked to success in sport?
yG7v4y_xwzQ,339509,342246,"Well, clearly an athlete has to be motivated."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,342769,348489,"Often goals that athletes set,  describe or..."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,348489,350495,will demonstrate  how much effort
yG7v4y_xwzQ,350495,353781,and how much will they have to win in their event.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,353781,356748,But sometimes motivation is not enough.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,356748,358503,"An athlete has to be confident,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,358503,363223,and confidence seems to be ubiquitous amongst high-performing performers.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,363223,365753,There's a number of strategies that athletes can use
yG7v4y_xwzQ,365753,367763,to boost their confidence.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,367763,371485,Another important factor is knowledge of the sport.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,371485,373750,"So basically,  knowing your sport inside out,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,373750,375265,but also knowing the opposition.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,375265,377781,What are their strengths and weaknesses?
yG7v4y_xwzQ,377781,381503,"One of the phrases coined by Clive Woodward,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,381503,384253,who was the England coach
yG7v4y_xwzQ,384253,388753,at the time they won  the Rugby World Cup in 2003.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,388753,390724,"One of the phrases he coined, was,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,390725,395496,"""Total rugby, leaving no stone unturned when it comes to performance."""
yG7v4y_xwzQ,395496,398078,He was very famous for developing  dossiers on the opposition.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,400660,403244,"Knowing their strengths,  knowing their weaknesses"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,403244,406522,and where he could attack them and how he could tactically win them.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,406522,409510,And that's clearly important  in sports these days.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,409510,412015,"So, using psychology  to understand the opposition"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,412015,413520,as well as yourself.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,413520,415755,"Athletes are also  very good at using routines,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,415756,417981,getting themselves  in the right frame of mind.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,417981,420250,We'll look at that  in a few moments time.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,420251,422515,Athletes are also good  at handling pressure.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,422515,424522,"If you look at Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,424522,426239,they are cases in point.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,426239,429256,And anxiety management  is clearly an important aspect
yG7v4y_xwzQ,429256,432283,of an athlete's arsenal of strategies
yG7v4y_xwzQ,432283,434759,to get them  in the right frame of mind
yG7v4y_xwzQ,434760,436762,so that they can perform at their best.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,438240,441254,So let's look at some  of these strategies in detail.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,441254,445531,"Motivation is clearly very important, and how do you get athlete motivated?"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,445532,448775,The most important things are the goals that they set.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,448775,451494,"The goals that they set  will determine how much drive,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,451494,452753,"how much effort,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,452753,455501,how much will they have to perform well.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,455502,457752,But often a goal of winning is not enough.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,457752,459753,"Sometimes, oh, most times,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,459753,463250,it is important that an athlete  has a number of sub-goals
yG7v4y_xwzQ,463250,465262,which are related  to their performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,465262,467254,"So things like personal bests,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,467254,471486,that drive them  both in training and in competition.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,471486,474508,It's important that these goals conform to certain features.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,474508,477776,"And scientists, psychologists and practitioners"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,477776,480504,always refer to this SMART- acronym.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,480504,483262,"And that's because,  having goals that are realistic,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,483262,486496,"relevant, specific, measurable and so forth,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,486497,490264,are really important when it comes to getting an athlete motivated.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,490759,494281,"As I said earlier,  motivation is not enough."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,494742,496528,"It is important  that an athlete is confident,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,496528,498034,and there are number of ways
yG7v4y_xwzQ,498034,500234,you can boost an athlete's self-confidence.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,500234,501264,Experience.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,501264,503242,Reminding an athlete of their experience
yG7v4y_xwzQ,503242,504530,is extremely important.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,504530,506775,"Modeling. I don't mean catwalk-modeling here,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,506775,508764,"modeling is also an important aspect,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,508764,512232,because that enables an athlete to have a model
yG7v4y_xwzQ,512232,516036,or blueprint if you like  of the optimum performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,516036,519770,Imagery and self-talk are parts of that and we'll get on to those in a moment.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,519770,521727,Feedback is clearly important as well.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,521727,524761,Positive feedback from the athlete's coaches.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,524761,526761,Imagery is a mental rehearsal
yG7v4y_xwzQ,526761,530011,and it is a strategy  that many athletes use.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,530011,532492,And here are the kinds of things that an athlete
yG7v4y_xwzQ,532492,535754,"or a coach will go through, when they're rehearsing their performance."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,535754,538506,It is almost like  a video of their performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,538747,540261,"They will also use prompts,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,540261,543495,but they also visualize  any contingency that arise.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,543495,546749,"For example, any barriers  or problems or difficulties"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,546749,550249,that arise during the course of their competition.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,550503,553758,Here's an example of these kinds of strategies in action.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,553758,555258,This is Blanka Vlašić:
yG7v4y_xwzQ,555258,558046,"she was a former world champion, high jumper,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,558046,560487,and YWF athlete of the year.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,560487,564238,And she was very famous for going through  the same performance routine
yG7v4y_xwzQ,564238,565738,prior to a competition.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,565739,569762,"She would close her eyes, visualize a successful jump."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,569762,572286,"She would clap her hands rhythmically,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,572286,574760,and use the audience to get the audience on board
yG7v4y_xwzQ,574760,578244,"and that would both boost her motivation and her confidence,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,578244,582279,and then she would practice some moves  shortly before executing her jump.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,583756,586513,Self-talk is another strategy that athletes use.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,586513,588267,It's an extremely important strategy
yG7v4y_xwzQ,588267,590998,because it enables athletes to go through in their mind
yG7v4y_xwzQ,590998,594252,"and use mantras  to try to boost their motivation,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,594252,597770,but also to try to manage  the competition and the situation.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,597770,599232,"For example,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,599232,602744,the situation where the pressure is on and they are highly anxious.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,602744,605508,"So, self-talk might have motivational components,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,605508,608276,but it also might help athletes focus on important things
yG7v4y_xwzQ,608276,609794,"that are relevant to performance,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,609794,612786,"so-called cues, and also might have a calming effect."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,612786,616278,Things like breathe and relax.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,617248,621261,Anxiety management is an important aspect  of sport performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,621262,622757,Clearly at the Olympic Game
yG7v4y_xwzQ,622757,625782,"the World Championships  at the highest level,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,625782,627759,athletes are going to be under pressure
yG7v4y_xwzQ,627759,629974,and they need to be able  to cope with that pressure.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,629974,631759,Sometimes being too anxious
yG7v4y_xwzQ,631759,634253,can actually undermine an athlete performance.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,634254,636251,It can be sub-optimal.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,636251,639513,"So relaxation techniques  are extremely important in this regard,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,639513,643035,and psychologists will work with athletes  to try and help them to relax.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,643035,645105,"So it might involve things like breathing,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,645106,647255,"stretching, relaxing the muscles,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,647255,650256,they'll also use things like music and meditation.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,650256,651793,"Michael Phelps is a good example,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,651793,655508,"he listens to music right up  to the few minutes before is an event,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,655508,658258,and that music will get him  to the right frame of mind
yG7v4y_xwzQ,658258,659258,for that event.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,659258,662271,It will help him to relax  but it will also motivate him.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,663737,666735,Here's a good example  of somebody using those techniques
yG7v4y_xwzQ,666735,668738,to the greatest extent.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,668738,671078,This is Yelena Isinbayeva:
yG7v4y_xwzQ,671078,674000,"double Olympic champion  at the pole vault,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,674000,676260,and also the world record holder.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,676260,679527,"This is her in the 2012 Olympics,  she's clearly very relaxed,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,679527,683492,"she lies back,  she covers herself in a close,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,683492,686758,this has the effect  of shutting out any distractions
yG7v4y_xwzQ,686758,690742,but also it has the effect of relaxing her  and relieving the pressure.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,691514,695509,"So in term of the mind of a winner from a sport psychology perspective,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,695509,698509,"an athlete has to be motivated, confident in their abilities,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,698509,700276,"manage pressure extremely well,"
yG7v4y_xwzQ,700276,702739,and use these well  trained-drilled techniques
yG7v4y_xwzQ,702739,705817,"like imagery, self-talk and relaxation."
yG7v4y_xwzQ,706491,707540,Thank you.
yG7v4y_xwzQ,707540,708763,(Applause)
