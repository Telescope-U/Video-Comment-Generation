VjTh03_ssHo,8160,10139,"- Sony's trying something a little new,"
VjTh03_ssHo,10140,11820,it's making its own gaming monitors
VjTh03_ssHo,11820,13980,and headsets for PC and PS5.
VjTh03_ssHo,13980,15719,Sony is good at entertaining you
VjTh03_ssHo,15720,16590,"in the living room,"
VjTh03_ssHo,16590,18450,but it usually leaves the PC gaming space
VjTh03_ssHo,18450,19590,"to other companies,"
VjTh03_ssHo,19590,21810,that's changing with its new INZONE lineup
VjTh03_ssHo,21810,23939,of gaming monitors and headsets for PC
VjTh03_ssHo,23940,25980,and PS5 launching this summer.
VjTh03_ssHo,25980,27779,"Yes, the name is goofy,"
VjTh03_ssHo,27780,29780,but I think the gadgets are pretty cool.
VjTh03_ssHo,32970,34230,I've gotten to spend a little bit
VjTh03_ssHo,34230,37350,"of time with Sony's high end INZONE M9 monitor,"
VjTh03_ssHo,37350,40829,"it's an $899, 27 inch 4K model."
VjTh03_ssHo,40830,41730,And it has the features
VjTh03_ssHo,41730,43079,that the most discerning gamers
VjTh03_ssHo,43080,44310,"want in a monitor,"
VjTh03_ssHo,44310,46890,"a fast 144 hertz refresh rate,"
VjTh03_ssHo,46890,48720,"one millisecond response time,"
VjTh03_ssHo,48720,50220,"variable refresh rate,"
VjTh03_ssHo,50220,51657,"along with DisplayPort,"
VjTh03_ssHo,51657,53010,and HDMI 2.1 ports
VjTh03_ssHo,53010,54899,to take full advantage of the PS5
VjTh03_ssHo,54900,57450,and PC's potential in terms of graphics.
VjTh03_ssHo,57450,59520,It also has a bunch of USB-A ports
VjTh03_ssHo,59520,61200,"for connecting accessories,"
VjTh03_ssHo,61200,63540,"plus a USB-C port with video support,"
VjTh03_ssHo,63540,65040,so you won't have to use an adapter
VjTh03_ssHo,65040,66360,to plug in a Mac.
VjTh03_ssHo,66360,68940,The M9 kind of checks a lot of boxes.
VjTh03_ssHo,68940,70650,A dedicated gaming display is
VjTh03_ssHo,70650,72360,both the most obvious move
VjTh03_ssHo,72360,74370,that Sony could make at this point in time
VjTh03_ssHo,74370,76230,and an unexpected one.
VjTh03_ssHo,76230,78930,"Other display manufacturers like ASUS,"
VjTh03_ssHo,78930,80970,"a Acer, LG and Samsung"
VjTh03_ssHo,80970,83100,have all but cornered the monitor market.
VjTh03_ssHo,83100,84900,But Sony's INZONE M9 comes
VjTh03_ssHo,84900,86490,with a couple extra unique features
VjTh03_ssHo,86490,89100,that may justify it's $899 price
VjTh03_ssHo,89100,90750,"compared to other options,"
VjTh03_ssHo,90750,94320,which is good because $899 is a lot of money.
VjTh03_ssHo,94320,95153,"So, okay,"
VjTh03_ssHo,95153,97508,what are you actually getting for that price?
VjTh03_ssHo,97508,100008,(calm music)
VjTh03_ssHo,101610,103830,"The M9 features full-array local dimming,"
VjTh03_ssHo,103830,106020,with 96 zones for finer control
VjTh03_ssHo,106020,107399,over the back lighting.
VjTh03_ssHo,107400,109410,That means you'll see more impressive contrast
VjTh03_ssHo,109410,110520,and a lot less haloing
VjTh03_ssHo,110520,112890,around bright objects in dark fields.
VjTh03_ssHo,112890,114900,Full-array local dimming is super common
VjTh03_ssHo,114900,115980,"in high-end TVs,"
VjTh03_ssHo,115980,117840,"like the ones that Sony makes,"
VjTh03_ssHo,117840,119640,but you'd be surprised how uncommon it is
VjTh03_ssHo,119640,121140,in gaming monitors.
VjTh03_ssHo,121140,122310,Most other gaming monitors
VjTh03_ssHo,122310,123780,in this price range are edge lit
VjTh03_ssHo,123780,125700,and typically use vertical dimming zones
VjTh03_ssHo,125700,127920,which just aren't as pleasant to look at.
VjTh03_ssHo,127920,130500,"It also supports DisplayHDR 600,"
VjTh03_ssHo,130500,132870,reaching a peak brightness of 600 nits.
VjTh03_ssHo,132870,135299,That's lower than where most high end TVs are at
VjTh03_ssHo,135300,137400,but it's brighter than most monitors.
VjTh03_ssHo,137400,139019,The finer control of dimming zones
VjTh03_ssHo,139020,140700,"and the HDR working in tandem,"
VjTh03_ssHo,140700,142950,"makes games like ""Returnal"" and ""Uncharted"""
VjTh03_ssHo,142950,146280,even more punchy with contrast rich landscapes.
VjTh03_ssHo,146280,147270,Brights are brighter
VjTh03_ssHo,147270,148770,and darks are darker.
VjTh03_ssHo,148770,150844,So a scary game feels just a little scarier
VjTh03_ssHo,150844,153150,when you're playing it alone in a dark room.
VjTh03_ssHo,153150,155640,But those aren't the only cool TV features Sony is
VjTh03_ssHo,155640,157020,bringing to this gaming monitor.
VjTh03_ssHo,157020,160050,"It's got auto HDR tone mapping for the PS5,"
VjTh03_ssHo,160050,161490,and theoretically that should just make
VjTh03_ssHo,161490,162750,the HDR perform better.
VjTh03_ssHo,162750,164550,The monitor will recognize the PS5
VjTh03_ssHo,164550,166170,when it's plugged into the console
VjTh03_ssHo,166170,169140,"and HDR settings will automatically be optimized,"
VjTh03_ssHo,169140,170760,but we'll have to do more testing to see
VjTh03_ssHo,170760,172830,"if this feature is actually worth the hype,"
VjTh03_ssHo,172830,175020,and whether you can manually tweak the display
VjTh03_ssHo,175020,177750,if the automatic results aren't to your liking.
VjTh03_ssHo,177750,180030,Another cool PS5 exclusive feature
VjTh03_ssHo,180030,181980,"is auto genre picture mode,"
VjTh03_ssHo,181980,184110,which automatically applies cinema mode
VjTh03_ssHo,184110,185670,when you switch from playing a game
VjTh03_ssHo,185670,187500,to either using a streaming service
VjTh03_ssHo,187500,189210,or watching Blu-ray.
VjTh03_ssHo,189210,190590,It's great that you won't have to switch
VjTh03_ssHo,190590,192209,"between gaming and movie mode,"
VjTh03_ssHo,192210,193590,"and then back to gaming mode,"
VjTh03_ssHo,193590,194670,and then back to movie mode
VjTh03_ssHo,194670,195870,"by yourself on the monitor,"
VjTh03_ssHo,195870,198030,because navigating menus on monitors
VjTh03_ssHo,198030,199890,is usually so annoying.
VjTh03_ssHo,199890,201780,"In my short time with the M9,"
VjTh03_ssHo,201780,204300,playing PS5 games looked fantastic.
VjTh03_ssHo,204300,205650,"I cycled through a few games,"
VjTh03_ssHo,205650,207480,each one showing off a better looking picture
VjTh03_ssHo,207480,208349,than I'd seen before
VjTh03_ssHo,208350,211237,while using a PS5 with any other gaming monitor.
VjTh03_ssHo,211237,213060,"""Returnal"" looked incredibly spooky"
VjTh03_ssHo,213060,214470,with its brilliant use of lighting
VjTh03_ssHo,214470,216063,and neon bullet effects.
VjTh03_ssHo,218970,219810,"Later this winter,"
VjTh03_ssHo,219810,222720,Sony will bring a 27 inch 1080p version
VjTh03_ssHo,222720,224370,of this monitor to the market.
VjTh03_ssHo,224370,225480,It's called the M3
VjTh03_ssHo,225480,227879,"and it'll cost $529,"
VjTh03_ssHo,227880,229110,and while it's a big step down
VjTh03_ssHo,229110,230460,"in terms of resolution,"
VjTh03_ssHo,230460,232244,it boosts the refresh rate to 240 Hertz
VjTh03_ssHo,232244,234150,without compromising on too many
VjTh03_ssHo,234150,236099,of the M9's high-end features.
VjTh03_ssHo,236100,238004,"It still has variable refresh rate,"
VjTh03_ssHo,238004,239790,"HDMI 2.1 ports,"
VjTh03_ssHo,239790,241590,"NVIDIA G-SYNC compatibility,"
VjTh03_ssHo,241590,243840,"along with DisplayHDR 400,"
VjTh03_ssHo,243840,245879,but it lacks full-array local dimming.
VjTh03_ssHo,245880,247590,You might have already seen it appear
VjTh03_ssHo,247590,249420,in some of the footage in this video.
VjTh03_ssHo,249420,251069,"It's also right behind me,"
VjTh03_ssHo,251070,252240,but Sony's also announcing
VjTh03_ssHo,252240,253800,some gaming headsets to coincide
VjTh03_ssHo,253800,255180,with the monitor launch.
VjTh03_ssHo,255180,256169,This is great news
VjTh03_ssHo,256170,259450,because the M9 monitor speakers aren't great.
VjTh03_ssHo,259450,262229,(calm music)
VjTh03_ssHo,262230,263790,At the highest end of the lineup is
VjTh03_ssHo,263790,266280,"the $299, INZONE H9,"
VjTh03_ssHo,266280,269490,"which can handle dual wireless connections simultaneously,"
VjTh03_ssHo,269490,271560,one through its USB-A transmitter
VjTh03_ssHo,271560,273360,and another through Bluetooth.
VjTh03_ssHo,273360,275610,Sony says that the end zone H9 shares
VjTh03_ssHo,275610,278610,"some common traits with the 1000XM5 headphones,"
VjTh03_ssHo,278610,280289,"like the soft pillowy ear pads,"
VjTh03_ssHo,280290,282240,and the stellar noise cancellation.
VjTh03_ssHo,282240,283530,I've had a little bit more time
VjTh03_ssHo,283530,284670,with the H9 headset
VjTh03_ssHo,284670,286560,"than I've had with Sony's gaming monitor,"
VjTh03_ssHo,286560,288720,and I really like two things about them.
VjTh03_ssHo,288720,290580,"One they're very comfortable,"
VjTh03_ssHo,290580,291720,the notches of the headband
VjTh03_ssHo,291720,294690,"can extend well beyond what my large noggin requires,"
VjTh03_ssHo,294690,295770,which I love.
VjTh03_ssHo,295770,297660,"Two, they sound just as good,"
VjTh03_ssHo,297660,300930,if not better than my personal Sony XM3 headphones.
VjTh03_ssHo,300930,302759,I could see these being my go-to headset
VjTh03_ssHo,302760,304260,"for gaming, video calls,"
VjTh03_ssHo,304260,306000,and for listening to music.
VjTh03_ssHo,306000,307290,One thing that isn't cool though
VjTh03_ssHo,307290,308700,they look absolutely massive
VjTh03_ssHo,308700,309750,when they're on my head.
VjTh03_ssHo,309750,311760,"I mean, look at them."
VjTh03_ssHo,311760,313620,"Like almost all headset makers,"
VjTh03_ssHo,313620,315926,Sony is touting spatial audio as being a big deal
VjTh03_ssHo,315926,317280,with the H9.
VjTh03_ssHo,317280,318210,With the idea being
VjTh03_ssHo,318210,320400,"that it can help you notice little audio details,"
VjTh03_ssHo,320400,321570,like enemy footsteps
VjTh03_ssHo,321570,323610,"before they get the drop on you,"
VjTh03_ssHo,323610,325469,"but it goes a step further than most companies,"
VjTh03_ssHo,325470,327030,because it's trying to tune the feature
VjTh03_ssHo,327030,328139,to your ear shape.
VjTh03_ssHo,328140,329760,Sony made a whole mobile app
VjTh03_ssHo,329760,331170,that takes photos of your ears
VjTh03_ssHo,331170,333600,to improve how the feature works on PC.
VjTh03_ssHo,333600,336000,"Going this far with the process is optional,"
VjTh03_ssHo,336000,336990,and while it's easy enough
VjTh03_ssHo,336990,338610,"to follow along with the steps,"
VjTh03_ssHo,338610,340919,"I couldn't immediately notice the benefit in games,"
VjTh03_ssHo,340920,343050,but I need to test it out some more.
VjTh03_ssHo,343050,345599,If you understandably don't want to spend $300
VjTh03_ssHo,345600,346740,"on a gaming headset,"
VjTh03_ssHo,346740,348270,"Sony has two other options,"
VjTh03_ssHo,348270,350879,"in the $229 wireless H7,"
VjTh03_ssHo,350880,353097,and the $99 wired H3.
VjTh03_ssHo,353097,356310,"The H7 ditches the noise cancellation from the H9,"
VjTh03_ssHo,356310,359070,seeing a boost in total battery life as a result.
VjTh03_ssHo,359070,361620,"As for the H3, has a slightly different design"
VjTh03_ssHo,361620,364169,"with less premium feeling build materials,"
VjTh03_ssHo,364170,366030,"but it's also only a hundred bucks,"
VjTh03_ssHo,366030,367530,and the audio performance is impressive
VjTh03_ssHo,367530,368700,for that price.
VjTh03_ssHo,368700,370530,"Everyone is trying to be the cheapest,"
VjTh03_ssHo,370530,371363,"or the best,"
VjTh03_ssHo,371363,372930,"or sometimes even both,"
VjTh03_ssHo,372930,374340,but I think Sony's new models
VjTh03_ssHo,374340,376980,might just be unique enough to stand out.
VjTh03_ssHo,376980,378480,I need to spend a little bit more time
VjTh03_ssHo,378480,379620,"with Sony's new gadgets,"
VjTh03_ssHo,379620,381309,but be sure to tune into theverge.com
VjTh03_ssHo,381309,383639,to check out my final reviews soon.
VjTh03_ssHo,383640,384780,And shameless plug
VjTh03_ssHo,384780,386160,but we have a new show on Netflix
VjTh03_ssHo,386160,386993,"called ""The Future Of"""
VjTh03_ssHo,386993,388370,and you should check it out.
