dxRBe8vm_mE,80,1760,all right let's talk about a couple
dxRBe8vm_mE,1760,4319,drawing hacks on drawing programs that
dxRBe8vm_mE,4319,6720,you can use to draw faster and more
dxRBe8vm_mE,6720,8639,efficiently number one if you're
dxRBe8vm_mE,8639,10240,struggling to make your coloring look
dxRBe8vm_mE,10240,12480,good this trick might help you if you
dxRBe8vm_mE,12480,14320,want to make a good color palette that
dxRBe8vm_mE,14320,17119,doesn't look weird or messy this is what
dxRBe8vm_mE,17119,19119,you can do the first is to pick a bunch
dxRBe8vm_mE,19119,21119,of colors that you would want to use on
dxRBe8vm_mE,21119,23199,your drawing you could have maybe five
dxRBe8vm_mE,23199,25119,colors on there it doesn't matter how
dxRBe8vm_mE,25119,27599,random they are just choose five then
dxRBe8vm_mE,27599,29840,what you're gonna do is pick one color
dxRBe8vm_mE,29840,32960,which is going to set the overall vibe
dxRBe8vm_mE,32960,34640,to your drawing if you want it to be
dxRBe8vm_mE,34640,37520,kind of warm you could use orange for
dxRBe8vm_mE,37520,39760,example so you're gonna draw a blob of
dxRBe8vm_mE,39760,41920,orange then in another layer you're
dxRBe8vm_mE,41920,44719,gonna put your other colors on that then
dxRBe8vm_mE,44719,47440,lower the opacity of that layer if you
dxRBe8vm_mE,47440,50480,notice the color is completely different
dxRBe8vm_mE,50480,52960,even though it looks the same this is
dxRBe8vm_mE,52960,54480,gonna improve your color because you
dxRBe8vm_mE,54480,56960,have this one unifying color to set the
dxRBe8vm_mE,56960,59440,overall vibe so the next time you color
dxRBe8vm_mE,59440,62399,use this tip number two transform so we
dxRBe8vm_mE,62399,64320,all know about the transform tool with
dxRBe8vm_mE,64320,66159,the transform tool you can basically
dxRBe8vm_mE,66159,69200,resize or move your sketches however did
dxRBe8vm_mE,69200,71119,you guys know that you can use it with
dxRBe8vm_mE,71119,73280,keys for example when you press the
dxRBe8vm_mE,73280,75520,control button while dragging it it lets
dxRBe8vm_mE,75520,78080,you deform the image this is actually
dxRBe8vm_mE,78080,80560,like really good for drawing stuff from
dxRBe8vm_mE,80560,83520,different perspectives another thing is
dxRBe8vm_mE,83520,86080,the anchor which is this cross over here
dxRBe8vm_mE,86080,88640,when you're rotating an image it just
dxRBe8vm_mE,88640,91439,rotates around the center but you can
dxRBe8vm_mE,91439,94240,drag that anchor so that the selected
dxRBe8vm_mE,94240,96560,parts would rotate around that this is
dxRBe8vm_mE,96560,98479,going to be really useful if you're
dxRBe8vm_mE,98479,100720,doing body parts this is gonna make you
dxRBe8vm_mE,100720,102799,change their poses without having to
dxRBe8vm_mE,102799,105680,redraw all those body parts so this next
dxRBe8vm_mE,105680,107759,tip is actually kind of weird i don't
dxRBe8vm_mE,107759,109840,know why people don't get this concept
dxRBe8vm_mE,109840,112079,if your canvas is small your drawings
dxRBe8vm_mE,112079,114880,will be small as a result it will have
dxRBe8vm_mE,114880,116960,smaller pixels and it's gonna look like
dxRBe8vm_mE,116960,119920,crap this is a super overlooked tip but
dxRBe8vm_mE,119920,122960,very very important always make sure to
dxRBe8vm_mE,122960,125600,draw on a large canvas because this is
dxRBe8vm_mE,125600,127920,going to affect the quality of your art
dxRBe8vm_mE,127920,129920,i mean i'm not saying that your art will
dxRBe8vm_mE,129920,132480,look less crap than it already is when
dxRBe8vm_mE,132480,134319,you make the canvas larger i'm just
dxRBe8vm_mE,134319,137440,saying it will improve the image quality
dxRBe8vm_mE,137440,139720,so for me personally i use
dxRBe8vm_mE,139720,141640,1500 by
dxRBe8vm_mE,141640,144480,1900 pixels this is actually important
dxRBe8vm_mE,144480,146640,for me since first it's a pretty good
dxRBe8vm_mE,146640,149440,size to start with not too small but
dxRBe8vm_mE,149440,152400,also not too large for my program to
dxRBe8vm_mE,152400,155040,keep crashing because my laptop sucks
dxRBe8vm_mE,155040,158239,but also this dimension also allows me
dxRBe8vm_mE,158239,161040,to upload my full drawing on instagram
dxRBe8vm_mE,161040,163120,as you guys know there's only a certain
dxRBe8vm_mE,163120,165920,part of the photo that you can upload on
dxRBe8vm_mE,165920,168160,instagram so just a side tip when you're
dxRBe8vm_mE,168160,170640,doing art always consider where you're
dxRBe8vm_mE,170640,172879,gonna post your art usually on instagram
dxRBe8vm_mE,172879,175440,people look through their phones so i
dxRBe8vm_mE,175440,178080,make sure to make my art more vertical
dxRBe8vm_mE,178080,180879,than horizontal if that makes sense also
dxRBe8vm_mE,180879,182800,consider how you're gonna crop it in
dxRBe8vm_mE,182800,185120,case it's too big for instagram you
dxRBe8vm_mE,185120,187200,gotta think about those things if you
dxRBe8vm_mE,187200,190239,want cloud you know just some advice you
dxRBe8vm_mE,190239,192800,know from a professional cloud chaser
dxRBe8vm_mE,192800,195360,this next tip is about background color
dxRBe8vm_mE,195360,197680,so this tip is pretty straightforward
dxRBe8vm_mE,197680,199599,the only thing you're gonna do is before
dxRBe8vm_mE,199599,202080,you put anything on your canvas change
dxRBe8vm_mE,202080,204879,the background color to a neutral gray
dxRBe8vm_mE,204879,206879,about fifty percent you know somewhere
dxRBe8vm_mE,206879,209040,around here the thing is if you're not
dxRBe8vm_mE,209040,211200,that experienced with the coloring yet
dxRBe8vm_mE,211200,214640,or values a solid white background might
dxRBe8vm_mE,214640,217040,be bad for you since like everything is
dxRBe8vm_mE,217040,219519,going to be dark in comparison to your
dxRBe8vm_mE,219519,222080,white background however when you use a
dxRBe8vm_mE,222080,224319,super dark background everything is
dxRBe8vm_mE,224319,226480,going to look so light compared to your
dxRBe8vm_mE,226480,229360,background so the solution just use a
dxRBe8vm_mE,229360,232080,color somewhere in the middle the next
dxRBe8vm_mE,232080,235040,is the lasso fill tool now you've heard
dxRBe8vm_mE,235040,237599,of the lasso tool and you've heard of
dxRBe8vm_mE,237599,239840,the fill tool what if i told you you
dxRBe8vm_mE,239840,242400,could use a lasso tool as if it was a
dxRBe8vm_mE,242400,245120,paint bucket so simply head over to this
dxRBe8vm_mE,245120,247280,straight line tool group called figure
dxRBe8vm_mE,247280,249519,and then you'll see the lasso tool right
dxRBe8vm_mE,249519,251599,there then just pick up whatever color
dxRBe8vm_mE,251599,254799,you want and use the lasso tool normally
dxRBe8vm_mE,254799,256880,like how you would use it this is going
dxRBe8vm_mE,256880,259280,to allow you to use the lasso tool to
dxRBe8vm_mE,259280,261840,fill colors this is way better than
dxRBe8vm_mE,261840,263840,using the paint bucket tool which is
dxRBe8vm_mE,263840,266400,hard to use especially when you're using
dxRBe8vm_mE,266400,268240,different layers and you know that's
dxRBe8vm_mE,268240,270479,pretty cool and all but
dxRBe8vm_mE,270479,273040,it gets better so there is a way to make
dxRBe8vm_mE,273040,276320,the lasso tool self aware or whatever
dxRBe8vm_mE,276320,278160,you call it and it pretty much means
dxRBe8vm_mE,278160,280800,that your lasso tool will only color the
dxRBe8vm_mE,280800,283360,parts that you wanted to so let's say
dxRBe8vm_mE,283360,285360,that you have some line art over here
dxRBe8vm_mE,285360,287600,and you only want to color the clothes
dxRBe8vm_mE,287600,289840,what this basically does is that it only
dxRBe8vm_mE,289840,293680,colors just that just the clothes this
dxRBe8vm_mE,293680,296400,is called enclose and fill and here's
dxRBe8vm_mE,296400,298800,how you do it now you can manually set
dxRBe8vm_mE,298800,301520,it up but that would be dumb because
dxRBe8vm_mE,301520,304639,there is a free tool that does exactly
dxRBe8vm_mE,304639,307440,that from the clip studio asset store
dxRBe8vm_mE,307440,310080,it'll be in the description we gotta
dxRBe8vm_mE,310080,312240,work smart over here anyway it's
dxRBe8vm_mE,312240,314240,actually really simple to do all you
dxRBe8vm_mE,314240,316320,need is your line art which is in one
dxRBe8vm_mE,316320,318400,layer and then add another layer below
dxRBe8vm_mE,318400,321120,that for coloring and then the tool that
dxRBe8vm_mE,321120,323680,you downloaded thank me later so on your
dxRBe8vm_mE,323680,325680,line art layer convert it into a
dxRBe8vm_mE,325680,327840,reference layer just by pressing this
dxRBe8vm_mE,327840,330400,button and that's it it's basically just
dxRBe8vm_mE,330400,333039,gonna use this lasso thing to just fill
dxRBe8vm_mE,333039,335680,a certain part of your drawing so i do
dxRBe8vm_mE,335680,338080,wanna point out that this only works on
dxRBe8vm_mE,338080,340240,clip studio since it's from their asset
dxRBe8vm_mE,340240,342400,store so just a quick disclaimer over
dxRBe8vm_mE,342400,344880,here but you can download clip studio in
dxRBe8vm_mE,344880,346880,the description as well i promise you
dxRBe8vm_mE,346880,349120,you won't regret it next so i know
dxRBe8vm_mE,349120,352240,everyone uses the ctrl z button people
dxRBe8vm_mE,352240,355199,even accidentally use it in real life
dxRBe8vm_mE,355199,358240,however if the undo button is the only
dxRBe8vm_mE,358240,360720,shortcut that you're using in drawing
dxRBe8vm_mE,360720,363840,you are seriously dumb using shortcuts
dxRBe8vm_mE,363840,366960,is super time saving and it helps out a
dxRBe8vm_mE,366960,370160,lot so for example i made the h key a
dxRBe8vm_mE,370160,373520,shortcut for flipping the canvas this is
dxRBe8vm_mE,373520,376400,super helpful okay because as we all
dxRBe8vm_mE,376400,379039,know flipping the canvas makes us see
dxRBe8vm_mE,379039,381600,how crappy our drawing really is it's a
dxRBe8vm_mE,381600,383759,magic tool it's an eye opener you have
dxRBe8vm_mE,383759,386639,to constantly be using that tool to
dxRBe8vm_mE,386639,388800,remind yourself that you suck so you
dxRBe8vm_mE,388800,390720,have to make it a shortcut it's actually
dxRBe8vm_mE,390720,393120,very easy to set it up for clip studio
dxRBe8vm_mE,393120,396080,for example just head on over to file
dxRBe8vm_mE,396080,398960,and click shortcut settings also bonus
dxRBe8vm_mE,398960,401600,tip usually when you press the x key
dxRBe8vm_mE,401600,404319,your colors will switch to the secondary
dxRBe8vm_mE,404319,407120,color over here and pressing the c key
dxRBe8vm_mE,407120,409440,will switch to the transparent color the
dxRBe8vm_mE,409440,412479,transparent color is super underrated
dxRBe8vm_mE,412479,414639,and helpful because it can make your
dxRBe8vm_mE,414639,417440,brushes act as erasers it's gonna have
dxRBe8vm_mE,417440,420080,the same texture everything just use the
dxRBe8vm_mE,420080,422560,transparent color the next one is the
dxRBe8vm_mE,422560,426160,liquify tool is it underrated no but am
dxRBe8vm_mE,426160,428000,i still gonna include it in this list
dxRBe8vm_mE,428000,430400,because i love it so much absolutely
dxRBe8vm_mE,430400,432400,however while some people just think
dxRBe8vm_mE,432400,435039,that the liquify tool is just able to
dxRBe8vm_mE,435039,436880,move the pixels around there are
dxRBe8vm_mE,436880,439360,actually a lot of settings on this tool
dxRBe8vm_mE,439360,441520,for example the expand tool makes your
dxRBe8vm_mE,441520,444080,drawings bigger and so on i like this
dxRBe8vm_mE,444080,446160,better than the transform tool because
dxRBe8vm_mE,446160,449039,the transform tool is really messy so
dxRBe8vm_mE,449039,451759,when i'm trying to fix the face i prefer
dxRBe8vm_mE,451759,454000,using the liquify tool and i suggest
dxRBe8vm_mE,454000,456800,that you guys do that as well okay last
dxRBe8vm_mE,456800,459840,but definitely not the least i just felt
dxRBe8vm_mE,459840,462400,like including this because it's hella
dxRBe8vm_mE,462400,464560,underrated okay i saw this tweet that
dxRBe8vm_mE,464560,467039,says that apparently
dxRBe8vm_mE,467039,471280,you can turn images into 3d poses using
dxRBe8vm_mE,471280,473840,the pose scanner on clip studio all you
dxRBe8vm_mE,473840,476639,gotta do is go to files click import and
dxRBe8vm_mE,476639,480000,then choose pose scanner then select an
dxRBe8vm_mE,480000,481520,image and it's basically going to
dxRBe8vm_mE,481520,484080,generate that pose for you and i'm
dxRBe8vm_mE,484080,486319,telling you guys it is so amazing it
dxRBe8vm_mE,486319,488560,absolutely blew my mind when i saw it
dxRBe8vm_mE,488560,490639,okay did you enjoy this video of course
dxRBe8vm_mE,490639,492639,you did then why aren't you liking it
dxRBe8vm_mE,492639,495120,yet bro anyway click this next video
dxRBe8vm_mE,495120,497120,right here and i'll see you there stay
dxRBe8vm_mE,497120,500120,cool
