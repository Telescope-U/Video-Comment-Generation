0tIodVT4AfY,5600,10639,so much of life  comes down to control
0tIodVT4AfY,11519,19680,understanding  what we cannot control  while simultaneously capitalizing
0tIodVT4AfY,19680,25599,and making the most of the things that  we can  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,25599,31240,a constant awareness that's critical to  our evolution
0tIodVT4AfY,32558,38559,epictetus wrote we must be at once  cautious and courageous
0tIodVT4AfY,38559,44320,courageous  in what does not depend upon choice
0tIodVT4AfY,44320,49520,and cautious  in what does  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,49520,56559,this idea has been shared many  many times in many ways over the  centuries
0tIodVT4AfY,56559,62079,another of which  a lot of folks have heard is the  serenity prayer right god grant me the
0tIodVT4AfY,62079,69840,serenity to accept the things i cannot  change  the courage to change the things i can
0tIodVT4AfY,69840,75280,and the wisdom  to know the difference  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,75280,80960,but regardless of how it's said  and who it's said to the point is the
0tIodVT4AfY,80960,87680,same  there are things we cannot control
0tIodVT4AfY,87680,96560,that we must find a way to stop exerting  ourselves stop exhausting our energy on
0tIodVT4AfY,96560,102479,they are as the saying goes  what they are
0tIodVT4AfY,102479,109040,these obstacles are immovable  and rather than continue to push
0tIodVT4AfY,109040,115200,and push and push  with all our strength and energy
0tIodVT4AfY,115200,123280,our time is best suited learning to  effectively navigate them  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,123520,129280,and then there exists those things that  are in our control
0tIodVT4AfY,129280,135840,i believe it was the power of now by  eckhart tolle he said  and i'm paraphrasing if something cannot
0tIodVT4AfY,135840,141200,be changed  stop thinking about it right the future
0tIodVT4AfY,141200,146480,represents anxiety it's worrying about  things that haven't happened yet
0tIodVT4AfY,146480,152239,the past  is essentially depression it's worrying  about things that
0tIodVT4AfY,152239,157760,already happened  we can't do anything about the past or
0tIodVT4AfY,157760,162400,the future all we have is now
0tIodVT4AfY,163840,168959,and if it can be changed  then act now in bringing about a desired
0tIodVT4AfY,168959,176800,result take that first step create some  semblance of momentum no matter how  small but to worry
0tIodVT4AfY,176800,183440,about what is behind you or in front of  you  is actually insanity
0tIodVT4AfY,183440,191040,i remember loving the simplicity and  pointedness of that message  accept it eliminate it or adjust
0tIodVT4AfY,191040,196640,yourself to it  sometimes it helps when i think about
0tIodVT4AfY,196640,203280,things in metaphors and  uh i tend to do it often this morning i  was drinking coconut water right of all
0tIodVT4AfY,203280,209599,things and  i was thinking man it'd be nice you know  those little pieces of coconut that  float around in there
0tIodVT4AfY,209599,216400,it's like it'd be great if they if they  were not in there right so i have this  idea just grab a strainer pour it
0tIodVT4AfY,216400,223120,through the strainer into the glass  i'm leaning over the counter watching  the pieces of coconut collect in the
0tIodVT4AfY,223120,230400,strainer and i'm just thinking sort of  zoning out like imagine if those were my  problems just being separated out of my
0tIodVT4AfY,230400,235599,life just like that how nice it would be  captured in a little net
0tIodVT4AfY,235599,240680,and then you know discarded thrown away
0tIodVT4AfY,240879,247760,but you know it didn't take me long to  realize a couple things one such an idea  would never happen life will
0tIodVT4AfY,247760,255360,always have some obstacle to place  before us that's what life does  after all the word is predicated upon
0tIodVT4AfY,255360,260400,the avoidance of death it's a struggle  and a necessary one
0tIodVT4AfY,260400,267440,which leads me to the realization number  two  we want hardship  you know purpose and meaning
0tIodVT4AfY,267440,272560,they're derived from our willingness to  overcome adversity and transform
0tIodVT4AfY,272560,279360,because of it  a life without struggle is a car without  wheels and sure you might avoid the
0tIodVT4AfY,279360,286960,fender benders but you're not leaving  the garage  right so that's a that's a thumbs down
0tIodVT4AfY,286960,292720,so i thought okay well what if i  slightly adjust that thinking what if  it's a subset of problems that i can
0tIodVT4AfY,292720,300320,remove  that's when it kind of hit me the  opportunity at hand right not the  so-called problems
0tIodVT4AfY,300320,305440,but my thoughts about them  they're the real difference maker here
0tIodVT4AfY,305440,311039,the negative storytelling that can be  removed pushed through the strainer  again not
0tIodVT4AfY,311039,318160,novel or groundbreaking like i said a  few minutes ago this idea has been  around for thousands of years but
0tIodVT4AfY,318160,324599,sometimes things land perfectly right  moment right time
0tIodVT4AfY,324960,330639,and i knew what i needed to do  was remove the worries and concerns
0tIodVT4AfY,330639,335919,pertaining to the events that i could  not change yet i exhaust my energy
0tIodVT4AfY,335919,343280,dancing around and around  with my thoughts about them  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,343280,349520,you cannot change the future  you can change right now
0tIodVT4AfY,349520,358080,which ultimately becomes the future and  there's a difference  i had to  you know pull that back in
0tIodVT4AfY,358319,363440,see i think most of our problems are  derived from anger or emotional  attachment to the immovable the
0tIodVT4AfY,363440,370000,unchangeable one of my favorite sayings  is you can't change the direction of the  wind but you can always adjust your
0tIodVT4AfY,370000,377039,sails  [Music]  and see when you remove the  self-tormenting you have going on about
0tIodVT4AfY,377039,383120,your past  things you wish you did or didn't do  when you remove the concern
0tIodVT4AfY,383120,389759,that the future won't be exactly what  you want it to be which tends to be  where i lean of the two
0tIodVT4AfY,389759,396160,uh you're left with one thing  the present right clarity
0tIodVT4AfY,396160,403600,you have officially empowered yourself  because the things you allocate your  energy to can be changed can be made
0tIodVT4AfY,403600,410800,better or adjusted  and that's really what it's all about
0tIodVT4AfY,411680,416800,you can't change the fact  that someone you loved or cared about
0tIodVT4AfY,416800,423840,let you down  but when you dwell on it you're now  giving up the present as well
0tIodVT4AfY,423840,430479,you're preventing yourself from doing  what is required of you now to make your  life better
0tIodVT4AfY,430479,436319,you can't control the fact that  your company's reducing its size and
0tIodVT4AfY,436319,441599,your department  is being eliminated  can't control the fact that
0tIodVT4AfY,441599,449680,you know eight percent get accepted to  whatever you're applying to can't  control the fact that you will be  criticized for doing the unpopular thing
0tIodVT4AfY,449680,454960,the thing that you believe to be right  and i say these things not to be a  downer
0tIodVT4AfY,454960,460160,i actually don't think there's anything  sad about this  to the contrary
0tIodVT4AfY,460160,465440,right now that you've accepted these  truths accepted this as reality now you
0tIodVT4AfY,465440,471759,can move toward what's best for you no  more dwelling on the unchangeable
0tIodVT4AfY,471759,477680,no more fighting unwinnable wars no it's  time to go put yourself in position to
0tIodVT4AfY,477680,484479,conquer whatever mountain is next  by straining out the things that cannot
0tIodVT4AfY,484479,489599,be changed you are left only with what  can
0tIodVT4AfY,489599,495759,you can't change your company's  personnel reduction but you can find  something else something better out
0tIodVT4AfY,495759,502400,there you can set the stage for a new  journey  you can't increase the acceptance rate
0tIodVT4AfY,502400,508960,but you can increase your value go above  and beyond put yourself in position to  succeed
0tIodVT4AfY,508960,515599,and if you don't they're lost continue  learning continue growing continue  moving forward you can't stop the
0tIodVT4AfY,515599,521680,world's criticism  but you can learn to toughen up  emotionally learn to trust your
0tIodVT4AfY,521680,526959,intuition and decision making surround  yourself with people you trust who lift
0tIodVT4AfY,526959,533680,you up  see when you stop wasting time and  energy on the wrong things you get the
0tIodVT4AfY,533680,541120,right things  like greg mckeon says in essentialism  it's not what we can acquire
0tIodVT4AfY,541120,547440,but often what we cut away  removing the things that weigh us down  that we're dragging along with us
0tIodVT4AfY,547440,554800,everywhere we go they don't need to be  there  i say to myself often that i have
0tIodVT4AfY,554800,560080,everything i need  it's there some of it's materialized
0tIodVT4AfY,560080,565360,some of it exists as a seed that i need  to identify and water and nurture but
0tIodVT4AfY,565360,571279,it's all right here  which means the problem will never be  that i'm incapable
0tIodVT4AfY,571279,579120,it will never be that i'm not good  enough  no when i'm in the wrong it's because  i've forgotten to see it
0tIodVT4AfY,579120,585760,i've either become consumed with the  wrong things or lost faith in myself to  do the right things
0tIodVT4AfY,585760,593200,and knowing this has been a gift it's  been tremendous it's helped me even  during the darkest moments to reacquire
0tIodVT4AfY,593200,598240,what matters most sometimes it takes  hours sometimes days even weeks or
0tIodVT4AfY,598240,604399,longer but i get there  eventually i arrive and so can you
0tIodVT4AfY,604399,612720,you have the ability to parse out why  you feel the way you do  to categorize the thoughts in your head
0tIodVT4AfY,612720,618560,can i change it no okay gone and with  all that's left begins the journey the
0tIodVT4AfY,618560,625519,good stuff  the adversity and the problems that will  make you who you are and don't  misunderstand me i'm not saying it will
0tIodVT4AfY,625519,632959,be easy  but i'm saying it will be worth it and  that's critical to understand your world
0tIodVT4AfY,632959,638959,is there to maneuver and adjust to  reshape  but its transformation depends on a
0tIodVT4AfY,638959,645040,laser-like focus on that which is  malleable that's saying do what you can
0tIodVT4AfY,645040,652079,where you are with what you have it will  lead you to exactly where you need to be
0tIodVT4AfY,652079,657440,even if you don't trust the road before  you  trust yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,657440,674940,[Music]  to walk down it  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,679990,687760,[Music]  today is not like any day
0tIodVT4AfY,687760,694640,i've lived before  and why should it be
0tIodVT4AfY,694880,700320,this very second  there are roads to be explored that i've
0tIodVT4AfY,700320,705600,never before walked down  there are actions to take that i've
0tIodVT4AfY,705600,714839,never before taken  and ideas to bring to life that i've  never before given the respect they
0tIodVT4AfY,714839,720480,deserve that's saying  my golden rule you are always one
0tIodVT4AfY,720480,727680,decision away from a totally different  life  you are always one
0tIodVT4AfY,727680,734399,realization  from pulling the lever opening the door  finding the answer you've been walking
0tIodVT4AfY,734399,739519,by all your life  the problem is you don't see today as
0tIodVT4AfY,739519,746079,today  you see it as a continuation of  yesterday the same movie with the same
0tIodVT4AfY,746079,751279,characters and same rules  without even realizing you need to
0tIodVT4AfY,751279,757760,change the script  emerson said write it on your heart that
0tIodVT4AfY,757760,763279,every day is the best day in the year  why because it can be
0tIodVT4AfY,763279,771440,your job is to remember that things will  continue on  and on and on until we give them an end
0tIodVT4AfY,771440,777440,we must manually close the book on  yesterday's story and start anew
0tIodVT4AfY,777440,785519,because we can  we often don't realize but we can
0tIodVT4AfY,785600,790720,and that is why the morning  each new day is so precious it's taking
0tIodVT4AfY,790720,797440,the mistakes and sometimes  disappointments of yesterday  and transforming them into today's
0tIodVT4AfY,797440,803920,lessons and the opportunity to begin  again  a new journey seen through a new lens
0tIodVT4AfY,803920,811440,walk through a new pair of shoes a new  sense of self  so here is your reminder that the words
0tIodVT4AfY,811440,816720,were  and are they're very different
0tIodVT4AfY,816720,824560,that's why each sunrise transcribes into  the sky  the hopes and dreams of the you
0tIodVT4AfY,824560,830560,that you've always wanted to be  it's not a crazy formula or some secret
0tIodVT4AfY,830560,838560,code  it's simply untying your boat from the  harbor that is yesterday
0tIodVT4AfY,838560,845000,and moving towards  tomorrow's horizon
0tIodVT4AfY,862610,868839,[Music]  someday  the things that you currently don't
0tIodVT4AfY,868839,872800,understand will make sense
0tIodVT4AfY,875360,881600,someday the big things you're dealing  with won't seem so big anymore
0tIodVT4AfY,881600,886959,someday the doubts  you have about yourself will be revealed  as
0tIodVT4AfY,886959,895440,false  someday you'll see that the things you  worry about didn't matter at all
0tIodVT4AfY,896320,902480,someday you'll see that the road before  you wasn't something you had to walk  flawlessly
0tIodVT4AfY,902480,908079,but rather something you had to trust  and believe in  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,908079,914399,someday you'll look in the mirror  and see that you had it in you the  entire time that there was nothing you
0tIodVT4AfY,914399,921120,needed or should have been hoping for  yes someday
0tIodVT4AfY,921440,926680,someday that will all be true
0tIodVT4AfY,926800,933600,but what about some days  from the past
0tIodVT4AfY,934079,940560,i remember years ago thinking someday i  would venture out into the world someday
0tIodVT4AfY,940560,945839,i'd speak my mind  someday i would start my own business i
0tIodVT4AfY,945839,951440,would surround myself  with people who believed in what i  believe
0tIodVT4AfY,951440,957759,someday i'd make a little more money  have a little more time to do what i  love someday i'd have all that
0tIodVT4AfY,957759,962959,and as i look around i realize  it looks a lot like
0tIodVT4AfY,962959,968560,someday  but guess what as we grow
0tIodVT4AfY,968560,974639,so do our some days  it's a chase that never ends
0tIodVT4AfY,974639,982000,there's always something more  there's always something bigger and  better
0tIodVT4AfY,982000,989120,the problem is not the ambition  the problem is forgetting that in so  many ways
0tIodVT4AfY,989120,994480,you've dreamt of being where you stand  right now
0tIodVT4AfY,994480,1001600,you have arrived  you're not the same person that 10 years
0tIodVT4AfY,1001600,1006880,ago was throwing some days out into the  universe
0tIodVT4AfY,1006880,1012380,no you have grown  you have learned you have evolved
0tIodVT4AfY,1012380,1018319,[Music]  why does this matter
0tIodVT4AfY,1019040,1025360,it matters  because without acknowledging how far  you've come
0tIodVT4AfY,1025360,1032319,you cannot acquire the strength needed  to go where you must go
0tIodVT4AfY,1032319,1038000,when you don't feel good enough  it's often because you haven't looked
0tIodVT4AfY,1038000,1044480,over your shoulder and opened your eyes  the evidence is right there
0tIodVT4AfY,1044480,1050640,it's hiding in plain sight there's proof  that you've been there
0tIodVT4AfY,1050640,1058799,that you've faced demons and conquered  them  endured your battles and overcame
0tIodVT4AfY,1058799,1065600,you did that  and at one point not that long ago
0tIodVT4AfY,1065600,1074720,you couldn't say that you had you  weren't yet that person but things are  different now what you have today
0tIodVT4AfY,1074880,1080960,was once only that hopeful  someday it was a fleeting thought it had
0tIodVT4AfY,1080960,1089679,no merit and no value yet you brought it  to life look  what you've done
0tIodVT4AfY,1090480,1096000,understand how far you've come how you  ran when you could you walked when it
0tIodVT4AfY,1096000,1101280,was possible you crawled when you had to
0tIodVT4AfY,1102240,1107280,and continued on to arrive at a someday  that is right now
0tIodVT4AfY,1107280,1114080,you my friend are a maker of things  unseen an architect of tomorrows and
0tIodVT4AfY,1114080,1119600,some days so don't you dare don't you  ever entertain the delusion that this
0tIodVT4AfY,1119600,1125360,gift suddenly stops now suddenly the  burden is too much
0tIodVT4AfY,1125360,1130720,the mountain is too tall  no what you do
0tIodVT4AfY,1130720,1136000,is overcome that is who you are
0tIodVT4AfY,1136000,1142799,you've done it for you you've done it  for the ones you love and in some cases  the ones who didn't even understand that
0tIodVT4AfY,1142799,1147919,you kept going  marching through the fires of hell to
0tIodVT4AfY,1147919,1152320,turn some days into right now
0tIodVT4AfY,1153440,1159600,and i get  that the road before you is uncertain  there's no way to know exactly how life
0tIodVT4AfY,1159600,1166240,will unfold  but that's besides the point
0tIodVT4AfY,1166240,1173360,a bird can't predict every gust of wind  it's going to encounter it spreads its  wings takes off and adapts because it
0tIodVT4AfY,1173360,1179400,can because it always has because that's  what it does
0tIodVT4AfY,1179440,1185200,i'm not advocating that you should have  all the answers  no i'm suggesting
0tIodVT4AfY,1185200,1190720,that you trust yourself to find them  to move forward into the haze that
0tIodVT4AfY,1190720,1195840,surrounds you to make sense of the  seemingly illogical bring about reality
0tIodVT4AfY,1195840,1202000,from the make-believe  someday
0tIodVT4AfY,1202000,1209360,you will have what you're aiming  for  but here's to never letting a today go
0tIodVT4AfY,1209360,1216480,by  without realizing that you are always  living out a someday from your past you
0tIodVT4AfY,1216480,1223280,are always arriving and leaving  simultaneously  the accomplished and the student
0tIodVT4AfY,1223280,1229840,crossing the finish line and on the  starting block with another race around  the corner another chance to stretch
0tIodVT4AfY,1229840,1235520,your legs and reach  for the heavens
0tIodVT4AfY,1235520,1241840,if you ever forget that  i ask that you find it within yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,1241840,1248880,to look over your shoulder  to remember what you once asked for
0tIodVT4AfY,1248880,1254559,and to appreciate the journey  that you have undertaken
0tIodVT4AfY,1254640,1260240,you did that  [Music]  now onward you go
0tIodVT4AfY,1260240,1267880,you have more some days  to bring to life
0tIodVT4AfY,1270400,1293109,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,1297760,1305200,i was thinking this morning about a  conversation i had with my grandfather  this particular example
0tIodVT4AfY,1305200,1311039,i was living in la at the time my  grandmother my grandfather they flew in  from boston and you know i think we're
0tIodVT4AfY,1311039,1316080,doing some family stuff but i wanted to  hang out with my friends down the street  right i wanted to go to kyle's house
0tIodVT4AfY,1316080,1322000,play star wars whatever it was we were  doing and that felt like the world to me  like i didn't want to miss out on that  because i felt like i'd lose it if i
0tIodVT4AfY,1322000,1328000,wasn't there i'd lose something  and i remember him taking me from the  kitchen to the living room being like
0tIodVT4AfY,1328000,1333039,eddie  you have to relax  he's like that stuff i promise you will
0tIodVT4AfY,1333039,1338159,always be there the fun  um the escape the metaphorical going to
0tIodVT4AfY,1338159,1344799,kyle's house will always be there you  have to do what's right for you  and then when you need that it's there
0tIodVT4AfY,1344799,1351120,it was almost like all the nuance and  the details requirable  and  why i'm bringing this up and it's a
0tIodVT4AfY,1351120,1358000,little bit of a pivot but  you know i've seen  throughout my life right personally this
0tIodVT4AfY,1358000,1363919,sort of loss aversion like i mentioned a  few days ago where  you don't want to leave a bad situation
0tIodVT4AfY,1363919,1371120,because  you fear that the very basic boxes that  you've checked you can't get them back
0tIodVT4AfY,1371120,1376880,right it's like you can have a job  that's you're not satisfied you're  unfulfilled
0tIodVT4AfY,1376880,1381940,there's nothing great about it you've  lost your sense of self your purpose but
0tIodVT4AfY,1381940,1387200,[Music]  you're getting a paycheck right or  you know at least you have some
0tIodVT4AfY,1387200,1393679,direction in the day or in your life you  can say who you are there's some  identity there's some very basic boxes
0tIodVT4AfY,1393679,1399679,you're not happy but the basic boxes are  checked and what you fear is if you  leave in pursuit of something different
0tIodVT4AfY,1399679,1405679,maybe you can't check those boxes again  right or or you're in a relationship and  it's like
0tIodVT4AfY,1405679,1411600,it's not right  and you know when your core it's not  right but there's very basic boxes that
0tIodVT4AfY,1411600,1417200,are checked  right  you're not alone you're with someone um
0tIodVT4AfY,1417200,1422480,there's some predictability in your life  like it'd be tough to lose those things
0tIodVT4AfY,1422480,1428320,and so  that's really the essence of what i want  to say
0tIodVT4AfY,1428320,1433679,right having the self belief in the self  trust because that's really what it  comes down to
0tIodVT4AfY,1433679,1441600,to understanding that if you move into  the unknown  you can recreate those things you can
0tIodVT4AfY,1441600,1448159,check those basic boxes off  but if you don't have the courage to  move out of that situation you'll be
0tIodVT4AfY,1448159,1455440,shackled uh to a world that's not really  meant for you  right so like
0tIodVT4AfY,1455440,1463279,the job thing and by the way i always  worry about saying this because there  are people that love their jobs i'm
0tIodVT4AfY,1463279,1468400,never ever knocking a nine to five like  it's just my thing right that was for me
0tIodVT4AfY,1468400,1473760,i felt so constrained and i'm just such  a  like i i love to be creating and sort of
0tIodVT4AfY,1473760,1479919,out on the fringes that's just like what  motivates me that's not how everyone  works so i don't want this to be  interpreters me bashing nine to five is
0tIodVT4AfY,1479919,1486640,just my story um  but like  i i realize that
0tIodVT4AfY,1486640,1492240,i could have walked away  come back in a year after living in uni
0tIodVT4AfY,1492240,1498559,like thailand  and things would have been exactly the  same when i got back right i could have  got a similar job i could have found
0tIodVT4AfY,1498559,1504240,ways to check off those same boxes right  those foundational things  they're re-acquirable
0tIodVT4AfY,1504240,1510080,just like the relationship thing right  it's like if it's not right for you  there's eight
0tIodVT4AfY,1510080,1515200,billion people  in the world  eight billion
0tIodVT4AfY,1515200,1520320,do you think one of those doesn't share  your value system one of those you can't  have fun with hang out with relax enjoy
0tIodVT4AfY,1520320,1526559,yourself improve your life like of  course you can  but you're worried about losing the very
0tIodVT4AfY,1526559,1532960,basics the very basic boxes that you've  checked  and it's like you have to have the
0tIodVT4AfY,1532960,1540720,courage and self-belief to walk away  from those things  you have to believe in yourself enough
0tIodVT4AfY,1540720,1547039,to know that you can recreate a reality  right with a similar foundation but with
0tIodVT4AfY,1547039,1552080,the things on top of that that make you  happy make you feel alive
0tIodVT4AfY,1552080,1560000,um you know like i'm prone to do i found  a random internet quote today it says i  am learning to love the sound of my feet
0tIodVT4AfY,1560000,1566000,walking away from things that are not  meant for me and it's that simple right  you can never
0tIodVT4AfY,1566000,1573279,get where you're going  if you're shackled to the things that  don't move you if you're staying in a
0tIodVT4AfY,1573279,1580080,place of discontent  and the message is simple right believe  in yourself trust yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,1580080,1587039,there's nothing in your life  that you can't reacquire  or rebuild
0tIodVT4AfY,1587039,1593120,but what you'll miss if you stay in that  place  is the opportunity the upside the people
0tIodVT4AfY,1593120,1598400,that will change your life the places uh  that you've never seen the experiences
0tIodVT4AfY,1598400,1604880,the journeys  that  make life worth living
0tIodVT4AfY,1605679,1610200,the upside is just too high
0tIodVT4AfY,1611840,1615900,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,1627840,1634159,there's a quote attributed to seneca  that states no man is more unhappy than
0tIodVT4AfY,1634159,1640410,he who never faces adversity  for he is not permitted to prove himself
0tIodVT4AfY,1640410,1646080,[Music]  meaning it's in pursuing the difficult  thing
0tIodVT4AfY,1646080,1653960,that we obtain  meaning  recognition that we prove ourselves
0tIodVT4AfY,1654559,1661600,but prove ourselves to whom  [Music]  this is the same seneca who famously
0tIodVT4AfY,1661600,1668640,stated that we suffer more in  imagination  than we do in reality
0tIodVT4AfY,1668640,1674240,that he is most powerful who has power  over himself
0tIodVT4AfY,1675919,1681520,and that's one of the beautiful things  about stoicism it makes us ask a very  simple
0tIodVT4AfY,1681520,1687520,but often overlooked question who's  really  the adversary here
0tIodVT4AfY,1687520,1694799,who's the opposition we're dealing with  as we fight our battles  what is it that must be transformed is
0tIodVT4AfY,1694799,1700640,it the outside world  or the way our eyes view the outside
0tIodVT4AfY,1700640,1706559,world  what's really holding us back
0tIodVT4AfY,1706559,1712399,the circumstances  for our own personal thoughts about the
0tIodVT4AfY,1712399,1718080,circumstances  and i think this is where we  misunderstand
0tIodVT4AfY,1718080,1721760,the challenges before us
0tIodVT4AfY,1723520,1730000,i want to delve into this power of  perspective  to explain that we are the gatekeepers
0tIodVT4AfY,1730000,1735440,between ourselves and our ideal lives  and very often we do a good job of
0tIodVT4AfY,1735440,1742559,ensuring that gate stays closed we  sabotage our own goals our own dreams  our own happiness
0tIodVT4AfY,1742559,1750240,while simultaneously pointing the finger  at a million externalities
0tIodVT4AfY,1751440,1758320,see when we look at the difficulties of  life and there's no doubt that life can  be a very difficult thing
0tIodVT4AfY,1758320,1764240,it's easy to look at the world as  this binary playing field right me verse
0tIodVT4AfY,1764240,1769360,the world and in fact we often visualize  the world as
0tIodVT4AfY,1769360,1775440,the enemy pushing back against us as if  its motives  were counter
0tIodVT4AfY,1775440,1781440,to ours  but so many of these narratives these
0tIodVT4AfY,1781440,1787279,stories they actually say nothing about  the outside world and when we look  deeper
0tIodVT4AfY,1787279,1793039,it becomes apparent that they actually  say a whole lot more  about us
0tIodVT4AfY,1793039,1799919,it's the one  viewing that gets to decipher  what the circumstance means
0tIodVT4AfY,1799919,1805760,and so all narratives are reflections of  the observers
0tIodVT4AfY,1805760,1811440,jim rohn used to tell a story about two  brothers  who had an alcoholic father he'd come
0tIodVT4AfY,1811440,1817440,home drunk he'd abuse his sons  they had a terrible childhood
0tIodVT4AfY,1817440,1822799,and as they each grew up and had  families of their own  their paths kind of
0tIodVT4AfY,1822799,1828720,diverged right one became abusive  and the other was kind and loving and
0tIodVT4AfY,1828720,1833840,caring  and when confronted the now abusive
0tIodVT4AfY,1833840,1841679,brother stated well look how can you  blame me  don't you see how i was raised
0tIodVT4AfY,1843200,1850480,but the kind loving and caring brother  stated of course i'm like this i could  never put my family through
0tIodVT4AfY,1850480,1857679,what i went through as a child  same circumstances  different lenses interpretations which
0tIodVT4AfY,1857679,1862640,means different real world results
0tIodVT4AfY,1863679,1869760,and the idea here  is to emphasize how one of the most  important abilities
0tIodVT4AfY,1869760,1875039,a human being possesses  is the ability to interpret the world
0tIodVT4AfY,1875039,1881919,around him  i think of us as  uh subjects navigating a world of
0tIodVT4AfY,1881919,1887840,objects  as though the things around us don't  have meaning until we place meaning upon
0tIodVT4AfY,1887840,1893039,them  that's what humans  do create
0tIodVT4AfY,1893039,1898159,narratives  out of  objects
0tIodVT4AfY,1898159,1903600,and that often overlooked  seemingly insignificant ability places a
0tIodVT4AfY,1903600,1910000,lot of power in our hands  very rarely is it what we see it's what
0tIodVT4AfY,1910000,1915120,we think and what we do about what we  see
0tIodVT4AfY,1916240,1924080,you ever hang out with people  that just tend to be happy  upbeat positive energy i have a a very
0tIodVT4AfY,1924080,1931840,good friend like that where his first  inclination  is always  to find the positive
0tIodVT4AfY,1931840,1937279,in moments where i've sort of trained  myself to pause take a second sift
0tIodVT4AfY,1937279,1942559,through the emotion uncover the value in  a tough situation refocus and take a
0tIodVT4AfY,1942559,1948720,strategic step forward  i look over at him and he's already  arrived there right he's been there for
0tIodVT4AfY,1948720,1955120,three minutes right eliminated the  negativity it's his first instinct he's  the metaphorical kid hopping around in
0tIodVT4AfY,1955120,1961519,puddles whistling at the top of his  lungs  while everyone else  is hiding out from the rain or at least
0tIodVT4AfY,1961519,1966320,trying to find the courage to run out  onto the street with
0tIodVT4AfY,1966640,1974799,then there are people who seem to always  find the negative  it doesn't really matter what this  situation is happiness is fleeting
0tIodVT4AfY,1974799,1981440,only to reveal the negativity that never  seems to go away right the kind of  person that if they won the lottery
0tIodVT4AfY,1981440,1986320,their first thought might be oh no but  what if i lose it all
0tIodVT4AfY,1986559,1992640,both examples are people projecting  themselves onto the world around them
0tIodVT4AfY,1992640,1998880,the same way that smoke covers and  consumes an entire room it's not the  room that's the culprit
0tIodVT4AfY,1998880,2005600,[Music]  here's another example from jim rohn  since we're on a jim rohn kick
0tIodVT4AfY,2005600,2012720,he's making a similar point and this is  all from a collection of speeches he has  on audible
0tIodVT4AfY,2012720,2019519,comparing humans to oranges which is  probably not a comparison you've made  recently but he said
0tIodVT4AfY,2019519,2027519,there's consistency to an orange  and that it can be  filled with one thing
0tIodVT4AfY,2027519,2032960,when you squeeze an orange  orange juice is coming out period
0tIodVT4AfY,2032960,2039600,it will never be apple juice or  grapefruit juice  it will only emit what it has inside
0tIodVT4AfY,2039600,2045279,which is orange juice  and while here's the connection
0tIodVT4AfY,2045279,2050720,when life pressures us  challenges us or metaphorically squeezes
0tIodVT4AfY,2050720,2055839,us we only emit the emotions that are  contained  and available
0tIodVT4AfY,2055839,2061520,that are alive and well  within us if there is no jealousy
0tIodVT4AfY,2061520,2066878,contained in our thinking  we're not going to project jealousy
0tIodVT4AfY,2066878,2073118,out into the world if there is no hatred  within us we will not project hatred  onto others
0tIodVT4AfY,2073118,2080320,why is that powerful it's powerful  because again it's one of the most  important things you can do
0tIodVT4AfY,2080320,2086560,certainly one of the most important  things i've learned to do is take that  finger pointing blame at the outside
0tIodVT4AfY,2086560,2094638,world  slowly turn it around  and point it back at myself
0tIodVT4AfY,2094878,2102880,and ask what thoughts what emotions what  ideas am i letting live inside my head
0tIodVT4AfY,2102880,2109920,that's altering the narrative the story  i'm telling about myself  and the world that i live in
0tIodVT4AfY,2110800,2116240,and while one might think well that's  uncomfortable that's unfair a little  extreme why should i point at myself
0tIodVT4AfY,2116240,2122480,it's not my fault  i would challenge you  at least for the sake of the next few
0tIodVT4AfY,2122480,2129040,minutes  to see such a change as empowering as  your advantage
0tIodVT4AfY,2129040,2134320,as the bridge from where you are to  where you want to be see if you always
0tIodVT4AfY,2134320,2140000,have feelings of let's say jealousy  around a particular person that feeling  in your stomach like oh they have it all
0tIodVT4AfY,2140000,2145119,they're ahead  they live how i want to live they're  this and that and i kind of hate them
0tIodVT4AfY,2145119,2150640,for it  you're naively giving the external world
0tIodVT4AfY,2150640,2156240,the power you're saying i feel the way i  do  because of that out there some cosmic
0tIodVT4AfY,2156240,2162400,injustice  [Music]  you are powerless  because you're neglecting your personal
0tIodVT4AfY,2162400,2168800,agency as a factor but when you turn  that finger around
0tIodVT4AfY,2168960,2173838,and say i only feel this way because i'm  allowing myself to
0tIodVT4AfY,2174160,2180720,then  you can ask the question so many never  think to ask
0tIodVT4AfY,2180800,2187760,why  [Music]  why do i feel this way
0tIodVT4AfY,2187760,2193839,which lights a path  to how can i fix it  see the key to a better life is
0tIodVT4AfY,2193839,2200079,realizing you don't have to be in the  passenger seat  pointing at and blaming the driver
0tIodVT4AfY,2200079,2205280,complaining about the road being taken  no you can get into the driver's seat
0tIodVT4AfY,2205280,2212160,you can take the wheel you can take  control  inherit responsibility
0tIodVT4AfY,2212160,2220838,and there's more at stake there's  greater vulnerability  but the upside is unfathomable
0tIodVT4AfY,2221040,2226640,and i find myself thinking all the time  man people are blaming the wrong things
0tIodVT4AfY,2226640,2232400,they're shifting blame to the wrong  adversaries the real  villain here
0tIodVT4AfY,2232400,2237760,[Music]  is not the driver or the road or the
0tIodVT4AfY,2237760,2243920,weather  the real villain is the voice in your  head pleading with you
0tIodVT4AfY,2243920,2253680,not to take the wheel  pleading with you to ride shotgun and  complain as the world passes you by
0tIodVT4AfY,2255680,2260720,and of course it makes sense to qualify  that  with the inevitability that there are
0tIodVT4AfY,2260720,2267280,some things placed upon us that are just  bigger than us that we can't control  and you can make a list however long you
0tIodVT4AfY,2267280,2272640,want to natural disasters decisions and  actions of others health problems
0tIodVT4AfY,2272640,2277599,we don't often get to choose the  landscape
0tIodVT4AfY,2278640,2284560,so as the stoics would say understand  that  understand what you can't control
0tIodVT4AfY,2284560,2292320,and what you can  because the beauty  is that you can control how you navigate
0tIodVT4AfY,2292320,2299839,that landscape and that  is power  that is what makes the difference
0tIodVT4AfY,2300000,2305440,see the two brothers i mentioned a few  moments earlier same landscape
0tIodVT4AfY,2305440,2312800,different  navigational tactics different view of  what it all meant one took the wheel and
0tIodVT4AfY,2312800,2318720,one  did not  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,2318720,2324720,so that seneca quote  that states no man is more unhappy than
0tIodVT4AfY,2324720,2332320,he who never faces adversity  for he is not permitted to prove himself
0tIodVT4AfY,2333200,2338560,well it's perfectly  clear as far as i'm concerned the the  question is not whether or not to face
0tIodVT4AfY,2338560,2344800,adversity  i think we all understand that
0tIodVT4AfY,2344800,2353359,what i hope we take from today  is a better understanding of what the  true adversity is
0tIodVT4AfY,2353359,2362480,a better understanding  of the fact that in front of us there is  always an answer a key to every lock
0tIodVT4AfY,2363520,2369760,some people just don't think to look  they're so busy peering around every
0tIodVT4AfY,2369760,2377839,corner for external enemies and  scapegoats that they don't give  themselves permission to succeed
0tIodVT4AfY,2378720,2384400,may be unfortunate but it's true  you can hit the bullseye over and over
0tIodVT4AfY,2384400,2389599,again  but if it's the wrong target it won't do  much for you might as well have missed
0tIodVT4AfY,2389599,2394720,by 50 feet and i think that is what we  overlook
0tIodVT4AfY,2394800,2402320,you can't always fix the outside world  [Music]  you can't change the unchangeable but

0tIodVT4AfY,2407760,2414560,as tolstoy said everyone wants to change  the world but no one thinks of changing  himself
0tIodVT4AfY,2415599,2421040,you're capable of being both your  greatest adversary and ally so choose
0tIodVT4AfY,2421040,2428400,wisely  because the world around you
0tIodVT4AfY,2428560,2435800,will do nothing more than respond  accordingly  to your decision
0tIodVT4AfY,2436260,2458130,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,2475440,2481359,just go  sure things will feel strange
0tIodVT4AfY,2481359,2488720,at first  abstract at first wrong at first
0tIodVT4AfY,2488720,2495200,it's incredibly difficult  to separate from the past
0tIodVT4AfY,2495200,2501200,it's hard to detach from the deeply  rooted biological whispering of
0tIodVT4AfY,2501200,2507640,hey  at least you knew what to expect back  there
0tIodVT4AfY,2508240,2514160,but that whispering has preservation in  mind not happiness
0tIodVT4AfY,2514160,2520240,and at some point  we need to stop preserving that which is  not ideal
0tIodVT4AfY,2520240,2527040,so go  the walls that once existed they'll
0tIodVT4AfY,2527040,2533119,crumble  and this will be startling at first
0tIodVT4AfY,2533119,2538160,shocking at first  intimidating at first  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,2538160,2543440,it's incredibly difficult to watch  foundational structures crumble around
0tIodVT4AfY,2543440,2551440,us  especially when you know you are the one  that lit the fuse
0tIodVT4AfY,2551440,2557440,it's hard to walk away from the faint  murmur  stating hey
0tIodVT4AfY,2557440,2563200,this was your home how dare  you leave it
0tIodVT4AfY,2563680,2569680,but those words they have status quo in  mind not growth
0tIodVT4AfY,2569680,2575920,and home is an idea you take with you  it's no set of parameters
0tIodVT4AfY,2575920,2581520,just go  the stories you told yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,2581520,2586800,the narratives you thought were forever  will prove to be nothing more than the  end
0tIodVT4AfY,2586800,2594319,of an underwhelming chapter  [Music]  this will feel abrupt at first
0tIodVT4AfY,2594319,2601440,unfair at first will leave you deeply  unsatisfied at first
0tIodVT4AfY,2601440,2608480,it's incredibly difficult to realize  that happily ever afters aren't linear  they're cyclical
0tIodVT4AfY,2608480,2614880,it's hard to walk away from the voices  pleading with you not to turn the page
0tIodVT4AfY,2614880,2621520,stating that because their realities  will remain the same so must yours
0tIodVT4AfY,2621520,2628319,but those aren't the characters  with whom you'll emerge victorious
0tIodVT4AfY,2628319,2634960,some movies must be recast  the setting reimagine
0tIodVT4AfY,2634960,2640240,the hero reinvented  and so it should be known that your
0tIodVT4AfY,2640240,2645520,greatest strength  is the little steps that you are capable
0tIodVT4AfY,2645520,2652160,of taking  little decisions  you are capable
0tIodVT4AfY,2652160,2659040,of making  remember  safety is not safe when it keeps you
0tIodVT4AfY,2659040,2665040,from what you need  and the wrong nows

0tIodVT4AfY,2677839,2684400,so if it's a sign you're hoping for  let this be it
0tIodVT4AfY,2684400,2692400,if there's a time you're waiting for  let now be that time
0tIodVT4AfY,2692400,2699599,if it's someday you are dependent upon  let today be that day
0tIodVT4AfY,2699599,2705599,as doing nothing is in fact a decision  but only one
0tIodVT4AfY,2705599,2711200,of many  [Music]  one path laid out before you one
0tIodVT4AfY,2711200,2716240,single grain of sand  where the edge of today's world touches
0tIodVT4AfY,2716240,2723040,the shores of tomorrow's  sometimes it's about the ability to
0tIodVT4AfY,2723040,2729520,stand up face the horizon  and just  go
0tIodVT4AfY,2729520,2735280,go because it's only upon going  that you realize you're capable of the
0tIodVT4AfY,2735280,2742560,journey you finally see in yourself the  strength  you've longed for
0tIodVT4AfY,2742560,2749520,it's in going that you realize  yesterday's situation  wasn't even really the problem
0tIodVT4AfY,2749520,2754880,it was your fear of the unknown  of leaving that situation it was living
0tIodVT4AfY,2754880,2762079,with the devil you knew  instead of potentially having to face  the devil you didn't
0tIodVT4AfY,2762079,2768480,that's what happened to your wings  they just felt safer tucked away
0tIodVT4AfY,2768560,2774480,but it's in going  that we acquire perspective the  tragedies the devastation the things
0tIodVT4AfY,2774480,2781280,that kept us awake at night  they really weren't that bad  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,2781280,2788400,but how are we to know  when you build walls around yourself  what's within them becomes your entire
0tIodVT4AfY,2788400,2794480,world  it's in going that you create yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,2794480,2801520,and while everything you need is already  beating in your chest  the great unknown before you is the
0tIodVT4AfY,2801520,2806720,water to that seed the key to that door  what you fear
0tIodVT4AfY,2806720,2813200,is exactly what you need  and so the beautiful dance through life
0tIodVT4AfY,2813200,2820400,goes on  not beautiful because of its elegance  it's rarely that
0tIodVT4AfY,2820400,2825599,but beautiful because of its promise  it's malleability
0tIodVT4AfY,2825599,2832800,beautiful because we get to move without  answers in order to find answers
0tIodVT4AfY,2833119,2839420,beautiful because what we become is  directly proportional  to what we're willing to endure
0tIodVT4AfY,2839420,2844640,[Music]  and that means that the universe doesn't
0tIodVT4AfY,2844640,2851839,judge  it doesn't know us by our failures or  our mistakes
0tIodVT4AfY,2851839,2857440,but by our courage  our courage to face all of these things
0tIodVT4AfY,2857440,2863200,and move forward anyway  to relentlessly explore the resilience
0tIodVT4AfY,2863200,2869280,of the human spirit  an infinite light in an otherwise finite
0tIodVT4AfY,2869280,2876559,world a bridge that  is built beneath our feet in real  time
0tIodVT4AfY,2876559,2883200,what a a weight off of our shoulders to  know this  we don't have to get it right
0tIodVT4AfY,2883200,2888319,we just have to step out the door  trusting that we will pick up enough
0tIodVT4AfY,2888319,2894079,pieces  to put together something meaningful
0tIodVT4AfY,2894720,2900880,we just have to go  and in the world
0tIodVT4AfY,2900880,2906480,it opens up  just like that  leave the old embrace the new simple you
0tIodVT4AfY,2906480,2912160,think to yourself  well yeah of course the best things in  life are always simple
0tIodVT4AfY,2912160,2918500,always have been always will be  we just imagine them to be difficult
0tIodVT4AfY,2918500,2925359,[Music]  we have a knack for making simple  decisions into complex matrices of cause
0tIodVT4AfY,2925359,2932720,and effect pros and cons wins and losses  we learn to think for years
0tIodVT4AfY,2932720,2938000,until we finally come to the brilliant  realization that happiness that meaning
0tIodVT4AfY,2938000,2943280,that a life well lived comes when  we think less
0tIodVT4AfY,2943280,2950559,ready  fire  aim there is no perfect path just an  adjusted course an endless series of
0tIodVT4AfY,2950559,2957359,change  of learning that  falling there's just a road sign
0tIodVT4AfY,2957359,2964559,indicating where we need to go next  you can't plan for that  you can't chart a course that doesn't
0tIodVT4AfY,2964559,2972720,exist  no you leave who you were yesterday  behind and you set sail
0tIodVT4AfY,2972720,2977760,they'll ask you where do you see  yourself in five years and you'll think  who knows
0tIodVT4AfY,2977760,2983200,but not here it couldn't be here it must  be somewhere evolved
0tIodVT4AfY,2983200,2988240,where pieces of the world  shaped your outlook and became the armor
0tIodVT4AfY,2988240,2995119,that you now wear  new game  new rules new expectations new people
0tIodVT4AfY,2995119,3001280,new places  and what really changed  well
0tIodVT4AfY,3001280,3007040,how you view yourself  it's funny how it all works how things
0tIodVT4AfY,3007040,3013839,come together when we look over our  shoulders  like it was meant to be
0tIodVT4AfY,3013920,3020800,as if this had to be the way things are  no you could very easily have stayed
0tIodVT4AfY,3020800,3025920,dreaming  looking out that window wishing you  could leave hoping for answers that
0tIodVT4AfY,3025920,3032880,didn't exist  and so the complex now feels as simple
0tIodVT4AfY,3032880,3039200,as we meant it to  we move forward not knowing but trusting
0tIodVT4AfY,3039200,3045200,and we look back with the sense of  understanding and a confidence that was  built over time
0tIodVT4AfY,3045200,3053040,in the game of life there are people who  go and people who stay  people who build and people who don't
0tIodVT4AfY,3053040,3059520,i'm not saying everything will be  perfect or everything will immediately  snap into place how could i
0tIodVT4AfY,3059520,3065040,but what i am saying  is that in moving forward we pull back  the curtain
0tIodVT4AfY,3065040,3072160,on the opportunity that is available to  us  we move from the physical limitations of
0tIodVT4AfY,3072160,3078160,the bodies we walk around in and towards  the infinite power of the mind
0tIodVT4AfY,3078160,3084880,that powers them  we become who we were always meant to be
0tIodVT4AfY,3085040,3090720,how do we know what that is well  not until we look over our shoulders of  course
0tIodVT4AfY,3090720,3097280,so go  go make your mistakes  go learn your lessons feel your moments
0tIodVT4AfY,3097280,3103920,of pain in your moments of bliss  your times of doubt and your times of  certainty
0tIodVT4AfY,3103920,3109200,because in doing so you will have done  the very thing  so few people get to do with their
0tIodVT4AfY,3109200,3115920,limited time on this planet  truly  live
0tIodVT4AfY,3115920,3121520,so go  just
0tIodVT4AfY,3121599,3124599,go
0tIodVT4AfY,3139540,3147929,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,3152240,3158400,sometimes it's what we don't say  that echoes the loudest
0tIodVT4AfY,3158400,3165440,what we don't do that has the greatest  consequences  where we don't go
0tIodVT4AfY,3165440,3172000,that ultimately gets us lost  i remember as a teenager
0tIodVT4AfY,3172000,3178800,applying to college  i was working on the admissions essay  brainstorming with my grandmother
0tIodVT4AfY,3178800,3184880,talking over possible topics and  approaches  and she read me this quote
0tIodVT4AfY,3184880,3193040,that's sometimes attributed to mark  twain  but that's beside the point the quote  states 20 years from now
0tIodVT4AfY,3193040,3198079,you'll be more disappointed by the  things you didn't do than by the ones  you did do
0tIodVT4AfY,3198079,3204160,so throw off the bow lines  sail away from the safe harbor
0tIodVT4AfY,3204160,3209359,catch the trade winds in your sails  explore
0tIodVT4AfY,3209359,3215440,dream  discover  i thought this was the perfect bridge to
0tIodVT4AfY,3215440,3221359,the next chapter of my life  the latest horizon the newest adventure
0tIodVT4AfY,3221359,3227200,i thought it was incredible and it was  it was exactly what i needed and so on
0tIodVT4AfY,3227200,3233760,to that next adventure i went  but here's the thing
0tIodVT4AfY,3233760,3239760,as life unfolded this equation somehow  transformed from exploration and
0tIodVT4AfY,3239760,3244960,dreaming and discovery  into the question
0tIodVT4AfY,3244960,3252160,well what am i supposed to do  somehow without my paying attention
0tIodVT4AfY,3252160,3257520,life turned into a checklist a question  i couldn't get wrong
0tIodVT4AfY,3257520,3262480,a test i needed to make sure i didn't  fail
0tIodVT4AfY,3262559,3268240,it's amazing how quickly we forget the  infinite breadth of life
0tIodVT4AfY,3268240,3276880,because we're focusing on the dotted  line before us  the one we're supposed to walk
0tIodVT4AfY,3277040,3283760,sometimes we're so fixated on what the  expectation is that we don't ask  ourselves where these expectations are
0tIodVT4AfY,3283760,3289280,coming from  who is so significant and wise
0tIodVT4AfY,3289280,3295359,that they know what's best for you to a  greater extent than you do
0tIodVT4AfY,3295359,3300480,so that's an important question  and also one you can lose in your
0tIodVT4AfY,3300480,3306160,periphery as you follow that dotted line  before you
0tIodVT4AfY,3306160,3312000,when you have a destination in mind  hopes  dreams ambitions
0tIodVT4AfY,3312000,3319119,well that's an adventure  when someone else has a destination in  mind for you whether this authority is
0tIodVT4AfY,3319119,3326240,imaginary or not  that's obedience  and sometimes the greatest disservice we
0tIodVT4AfY,3326240,3333520,can do to ourselves  is to not stop and think to not stop and  ask ourselves where we're going
0tIodVT4AfY,3333520,3339599,and why  do you remember when you were a child  and you got into trouble right sometimes
0tIodVT4AfY,3339599,3345599,you get sent to your room  and for me  this was agony when it was punishment i
0tIodVT4AfY,3345599,3350720,wanted to be anywhere but can find  within those walls i hated being sent to
0tIodVT4AfY,3350720,3358880,my room  and then finally  the door would open my parents would say  eddie you can come out now
0tIodVT4AfY,3358880,3365359,i'd go outside play basketball for a  little bit and then oftentimes i'd find  myself right back in my room
0tIodVT4AfY,3365359,3370640,happy  you know playing with my toys whatever i  was doing not a care in the world and
0tIodVT4AfY,3370640,3377839,it's like what changed  nothing but the context  same me same room same toys saying
0tIodVT4AfY,3377839,3384640,whatever i was doing  it was however no longer a punishment  and i think this realization is worth
0tIodVT4AfY,3384640,3391760,exploring  we may not realize  we may not even be able to articulate it
0tIodVT4AfY,3391760,3399280,but i think we long for control over our  lives we long to walk our own path
0tIodVT4AfY,3399280,3406480,and in this situation the path led me  right back to where i was  sometimes though the path leads us in
0tIodVT4AfY,3406480,3413040,the opposite direction far away to  distant worlds  the end destination is not as important
0tIodVT4AfY,3413040,3419680,as the fact that we  chose it  that we asked ourselves why
0tIodVT4AfY,3419680,3426400,and that we believe in the answer and  immerse ourselves in its execution
0tIodVT4AfY,3426559,3433440,so when mark twain talks about the  things that  we don't do holding more weight in our  hearts
0tIodVT4AfY,3433440,3442079,it's because those things we tend to  skip over are often the very things that  breathe life into our souls
0tIodVT4AfY,3442240,3447920,we'll go to school to get good grades to  get a nine to five to get a promotion to
0tIodVT4AfY,3447920,3452960,get a mortgage on a home  but the audacity to open that
0tIodVT4AfY,3452960,3459680,photography studio  the nerve to think you could rent a van  and travel the country
0tIodVT4AfY,3459680,3468798,the delusion to think you could start  that routine that will get you in the  physical shape you've always dreamed of
0tIodVT4AfY,3468960,3476480,see we're lucky and fortunate to have  the things that we have the quality of  life we lead now far exceeds those that
0tIodVT4AfY,3476480,3483839,came before us life is convenient  incredibly convenient  but what is convenience if it comes at
0tIodVT4AfY,3483839,3491359,the expense of purpose of meaning in  life because that's what steers the ship
0tIodVT4AfY,3491359,3496559,a crisis of meaning ultimately mitigates  everything else there is no exploration
0tIodVT4AfY,3496559,3503599,without meaning  and without exploration tomorrow becomes  a repetition
0tIodVT4AfY,3503599,3510079,of today  not an evolution  of today
0tIodVT4AfY,3510400,3518000,and what's incredible truly incredible  is that our purpose can be rediscovered  our paths redefined
0tIodVT4AfY,3518000,3523680,how by having a long conversation with  you guessed it yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,3523680,3531680,by putting the phone in another room by  disconnecting the wi-fi and spending  time with you
0tIodVT4AfY,3531680,3537359,something along the lines of dear self  what matters to me in this world
0tIodVT4AfY,3537359,3544480,where am i going right now  is where i'm going right now aligned  with what matters to me in this world
0tIodVT4AfY,3544480,3549520,and sometimes the answer is yes  sometimes no  great but what we have now is a
0tIodVT4AfY,3549520,3555040,foundation to work off of  an awareness
0tIodVT4AfY,3555040,3561760,that should be celebrated that you  created  it's so easy to walk through life and
0tIodVT4AfY,3561760,3568480,never have that conversation it's so  easy to sleepwalk  to the tune of someone else's song the
0tIodVT4AfY,3568480,3576640,beat of other people's drums  but when you open your eyes
0tIodVT4AfY,3576640,3584000,you see the correlation between  your thoughts and your actions  your actions in your reality
0tIodVT4AfY,3584000,3589599,you realize that when you wake up  that tendency to ask yourself what you
0tIodVT4AfY,3589599,3595760,have to do today to reflect on your  problems those questions you assumed  were normal that you never gave much
0tIodVT4AfY,3595760,3600799,thought to  well now you'll see you can dismantle
0tIodVT4AfY,3600799,3606559,that notion  now you'll see that if you can ask  yourself what you have to do
0tIodVT4AfY,3606559,3613920,you can just as easily ask yourself what  you want to do  what you get to do what life is inviting
0tIodVT4AfY,3613920,3620960,you to do  if you can reflect on your problems you  are just as capable of reflecting on the
0tIodVT4AfY,3620960,3626480,opportunity at your fingertips if you  can spend time dwelling on whether  you're walking
0tIodVT4AfY,3626480,3633280,the obligatory dotted line that's been  laid out in front of you  you're just as capable
0tIodVT4AfY,3633280,3638760,of redrawing that line and allowing it  to pull you into a new  dimension
0tIodVT4AfY,3638760,3644160,[Music]  listen again 20 years from now
0tIodVT4AfY,3644160,3650400,you will be more disappointed by the  things you didn't do than by the ones  you did do
0tIodVT4AfY,3650400,3655760,so throw off the bow lines sail away  from the safe harbor catch the trade
0tIodVT4AfY,3655760,3661200,winds in your sails explore  dream discover
0tIodVT4AfY,3661200,3666960,explore but for you wander down those  paths that have for so long piqued your
0tIodVT4AfY,3666960,3673200,curiosity  try things you once felt like other  people were entitled to but you'd never
0tIodVT4AfY,3673200,3680079,given yourself permission  be that for yourself  because no one will come up to you and
0tIodVT4AfY,3680079,3687359,randomly give you that green light  [Music]  because without building your castles in
0tIodVT4AfY,3687359,3693200,the air as thorough calls them you live  your entire life on the ground
0tIodVT4AfY,3693200,3699200,you'll never hit targets that you don't  create  and sure there'll be a time that only
0tIodVT4AfY,3699200,3705920,you see the destination  great that's life but with each step  forward as it becomes more real for you
0tIodVT4AfY,3705920,3712240,it will make sense to others as well  trust each step like it is in and of
0tIodVT4AfY,3712240,3720480,itself a miracle  and you'll find in time that that's  exactly what each step was
0tIodVT4AfY,3720480,3726400,and lastly discover  discover who you are what you're capable  of becoming
0tIodVT4AfY,3726400,3733119,as emerson said to be yourself in a  world that is constantly trying to make  you something else is the greatest
0tIodVT4AfY,3733119,3742079,accomplishment  to forge your own path build your own  life stay true to your own heart
0tIodVT4AfY,3742079,3749200,is courage  so sail away  because you have the ability
0tIodVT4AfY,3749200,3754480,because you are strong enough  and because the story you're about to
0tIodVT4AfY,3754480,3759520,write  doesn't continue on until you turn the
0tIodVT4AfY,3759520,3764830,page  on today's  chapter
0tIodVT4AfY,3764830,3772000,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,3782160,3788799,many of life's failures  are people who didn't realize how close  they were to success
0tIodVT4AfY,3788799,3794319,when they gave up  thomas edison
0tIodVT4AfY,3794319,3800799,a quote i go to when i've lost my why  when my frustration over the lack of a
0tIodVT4AfY,3800799,3806799,particular result overshadows everything  i don't think we realize how
0tIodVT4AfY,3806799,3812960,transformative these moments are  when confronted by them
0tIodVT4AfY,3812960,3820079,we're presented two options  give up  or emerge better
0tIodVT4AfY,3820079,3826880,than we  were not intuitive right it's not normal
0tIodVT4AfY,3826880,3832720,to think  i know this is hard but hey i'm one  adjustment away from getting it right
0tIodVT4AfY,3832720,3839920,one move away from uncovering momentum  that's why in such moments
0tIodVT4AfY,3839920,3846160,i rely on others to remind me and it's  why i remind you now
0tIodVT4AfY,3846400,3853839,to reiterate how small a push is  required to simply get things moving
0tIodVT4AfY,3853839,3859920,to remind you that you do  want this  it does
0tIodVT4AfY,3859920,3866960,mean something to you  and you know what these are the moments  you'll look back on
0tIodVT4AfY,3866960,3873520,with the tear in your eye  a smile on your face
0tIodVT4AfY,3873520,3880880,and you'll be grateful you push through  these moments  the darkest of nights the lowest of lows
0tIodVT4AfY,3880880,3887599,when we're lost we're stuck  unsure  they are the ones that matter so shake
0tIodVT4AfY,3887599,3895280,it off  see the difference  the reason so many people turn around is
0tIodVT4AfY,3895280,3901760,because they don't know the secret i'm  about to tell you  the very same secret those before
0tIodVT4AfY,3901760,3906839,have passed on to me you don't need to  do
0tIodVT4AfY,3906839,3912880,anything  but not  stop
0tIodVT4AfY,3912880,3919039,and if that seems too obvious or cliche  let me explain to you that it's in going
0tIodVT4AfY,3919039,3926319,that we're forced to find solutions  we're forced to become more  it's incredibly hard to stop an object
0tIodVT4AfY,3926319,3932799,in motion  but the question is can you move forward  when you don't have the answers when
0tIodVT4AfY,3932799,3938720,you're tired  when what you've been looking for is  nowhere to be found can you imagine at
0tIodVT4AfY,3938720,3943920,that moment what the other side will be  like  looking back on your journey knowing
0tIodVT4AfY,3943920,3950240,that where others stopped you hung on  where the cost was too much for so many
0tIodVT4AfY,3950240,3955599,you laid it all on the line these are  the decisions you have to make now so
0tIodVT4AfY,3955599,3960880,don't listen to that voice rationalizing  begging you to take it down a notch or
0tIodVT4AfY,3960880,3967359,return to the normalcy of yesterday let  this message resonate hear me
0tIodVT4AfY,3967359,3973359,embrace the fact that you are always one  move away from recapturing momentum from
0tIodVT4AfY,3973359,3979680,finding yourself again  it's there  everything you need is there have the
0tIodVT4AfY,3979680,3986319,patience to find it the patience to do  what you do best
0tIodVT4AfY,3986319,4003679,find  a  way  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4011380,4017599,[Music]  i'll never forget
0tIodVT4AfY,4017599,4023280,listening to jim rohn  was taking a walk in the middle of the  day
0tIodVT4AfY,4023280,4028640,i needed to get out decompress rethink  realign
0tIodVT4AfY,4028640,4037920,and this message came through my  headphones  he said  we must all suffer from one of two pains
0tIodVT4AfY,4037920,4044720,the pain of discipline  or the pain of regret  the difference is discipline weighs
0tIodVT4AfY,4044720,4049838,ounces while regret weighs tons
0tIodVT4AfY,4050240,4056160,and i needed that  i needed that because sometimes we  forget
0tIodVT4AfY,4056160,4063520,why  in the midst of the day-to-day  the trials and tribulations of life we
0tIodVT4AfY,4063520,4068078,forget why  we endure
0tIodVT4AfY,4069359,4075119,and there's a a strange dichotomy that  exists  because you know you can't measure
0tIodVT4AfY,4075119,4081440,discomfort that hasn't arrived yet  you can't identify regret that hasn't
0tIodVT4AfY,4081440,4087839,materialized  [Music]  yet in a way  you have to
0tIodVT4AfY,4087839,4095440,you have to somehow make that tangible  you have to know that  sacrifices of today deliver you from the
0tIodVT4AfY,4095440,4104640,anguish  of i wish  or if only or maybe i could have
0tIodVT4AfY,4104640,4110960,i've heard it said that humans ability  to delay gratification is what makes us  so unique
0tIodVT4AfY,4110960,4117259,incredible even  but that doesn't mean it comes easy
0tIodVT4AfY,4117259,4125199,[Music]  so as i walked  [Music]  i became reacquainted
0tIodVT4AfY,4125199,4133520,with the trust that i had in myself  in the future and the steps i was taking
0tIodVT4AfY,4133520,4139600,it wasn't that i'd reached some grand  finale but  that i gave myself permission to stop
0tIodVT4AfY,4139600,4145838,constantly expecting one  [Music]  worrying when things didn't go as
0tIodVT4AfY,4145838,4151359,planned feeling disgusted with myself  when i fell short
0tIodVT4AfY,4151359,4155920,this is after all part of a process
0tIodVT4AfY,4156880,4162080,and if one stays the course  builds a foundation of discipline to
0tIodVT4AfY,4162080,4167600,guide them towards what they believe in  things will evolve
0tIodVT4AfY,4167680,4174000,[Music]  we feel uncertain  because new things don't have a
0tIodVT4AfY,4174000,4179278,precedent at least not a personal one  and that feeling of
0tIodVT4AfY,4179278,4185679,you know i wish i knew or had some  predictability  it's real it's common
0tIodVT4AfY,4185679,4191120,but if minimizing regret is what means  the most
0tIodVT4AfY,4191120,4197400,then it also means that we must have the  discipline to walk steadfast into the
0tIodVT4AfY,4197400,4205550,unpredictability of tomorrow  a long-term sustained discipline
0tIodVT4AfY,4205550,4211360,[Music]  and one of my favorite interviews  bronnie ware who wrote the top five
0tIodVT4AfY,4211360,4217679,regrets of the dying  was talking about surrender  and how she mentioned in her book
0tIodVT4AfY,4217679,4224560,letting go  and i asked her can you explain that  what's the angle
0tIodVT4AfY,4224560,4230880,because the way i look at life there's  always something you can do  you can always improve your situation
0tIodVT4AfY,4230880,4236320,somehow  and she basically said
0tIodVT4AfY,4236320,4242400,it's not about what you can control what  you can do
0tIodVT4AfY,4242400,4247840,it's about putting yourself in position  to live the life you want to live
0tIodVT4AfY,4247840,4254080,and then letting go of that which you  cannot control
0tIodVT4AfY,4254400,4259760,it's about not worrying  over external forces as you walk your
0tIodVT4AfY,4259760,4266960,path because all you can do in life is  walk your path  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4266960,4274880,and that became the marker  or the question am i walking my path
0tIodVT4AfY,4275360,4282080,right now look at it like this  first  a vision gives you direction purpose
0tIodVT4AfY,4282080,4288880,keeps you excited injects meaning into  life  second
0tIodVT4AfY,4288880,4295120,discipline keeps you moving becomes the  tiny steps that transport you
0tIodVT4AfY,4295120,4303120,through your pursuit of meaning  [Music]  and third trust in the process
0tIodVT4AfY,4303120,4310640,that you are here to give everything you  have to give  and then the rest as brony says must be
0tIodVT4AfY,4310640,4317120,surrendered  [Music]  but the reason i bring this up
0tIodVT4AfY,4317120,4323600,is because all of it fits together like  a puzzle  like three pillars
0tIodVT4AfY,4323600,4330080,of a parthenon  and when people reach out to me all the  time they're upset that they're not as
0tIodVT4AfY,4330080,4336560,disciplined as they'd like to be  and they're listening to the speeches  they're watching the videos they're
0tIodVT4AfY,4336560,4343280,absorbing the content trying to improve  but nothing seems to get the engine
0tIodVT4AfY,4343280,4350640,going and i'm wondering  what is your north star
0tIodVT4AfY,4350640,4356320,what are you aiming for  because as far as i'm concerned it's
0tIodVT4AfY,4356320,4361760,impossible to be disciplined if you  don't have a reason  you know when jim rohn states that the
0tIodVT4AfY,4361760,4367440,pain is in ounces now  well there's an implicit compared to
0tIodVT4AfY,4367440,4372800,what  being asked right compared to that top  of the mountain that you'd presumably
0tIodVT4AfY,4372800,4378590,miss out on  so if the mountaintop's not defined  you're on a fool's errand
0tIodVT4AfY,4378590,4385360,[Music]  that's why i had so much trouble with my  old career for example it's hard to be
0tIodVT4AfY,4385360,4390960,disciplined  there's no buy-in on the purpose
0tIodVT4AfY,4390960,4396840,using my previous metaphor it's little  steps sure but towards
0tIodVT4AfY,4396840,4403120,what if you don't know it's only  practical then to look around and ask  yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,4403120,4408800,why am i taking them  why not go drink with my friends why not
0tIodVT4AfY,4408800,4413940,stream this series on netflix until 4am  why not skip the workout
0tIodVT4AfY,4413940,4420560,[Music]  you can listen to people on youtube  scream at you to do more and be more and
0tIodVT4AfY,4420560,4426450,try harder all day but without that  peace it will not get you very far
0tIodVT4AfY,4426450,4432480,[Music]  a vision
0tIodVT4AfY,4432480,4438880,the discipline to pursue it and a trust  in the process  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4438880,4445120,and you could say the same with someone  who might have a clear vision a dream a  perfect idea of what they want
0tIodVT4AfY,4445120,4452180,but never take action right the  discipline never materializes  makes the endeavor just as meaningless
0tIodVT4AfY,4452180,4457360,[Music]  things don't change until you take that  big picture
0tIodVT4AfY,4457360,4463840,that vision  and you break it down into little things  you can do every day
0tIodVT4AfY,4463840,4469120,that's it  and isn't that amazing
0tIodVT4AfY,4469120,4474960,the greatest most influential people  from the friends and family that inspire  us
0tIodVT4AfY,4474960,4481120,to the greatest athletes and  entertainers  to our greatest thinkers creators world
0tIodVT4AfY,4481120,4488080,leaders all they do  is a handful of things consistently
0tIodVT4AfY,4488080,4496239,every day  in the direction  of something that is meaningful to them
0tIodVT4AfY,4496239,4503600,a process that has been talked about  since the beginning of time  the compound effect as darren hardy
0tIodVT4AfY,4503600,4510880,calls it  that breakthrough was huge for me
0tIodVT4AfY,4510880,4518000,the realization that i don't need to  leap any mountain  i just need to ascend
0tIodVT4AfY,4518000,4526400,one tiny rock at a time and that is not  a superhuman ability that is a single
0tIodVT4AfY,4526400,4532800,decision  [Music]  so here the question isn't can you be
0tIodVT4AfY,4532800,4538560,more disciplined of course you can  the question is
0tIodVT4AfY,4538560,4545840,which few things are most meaningful to  you  which will you be focusing on every day
0tIodVT4AfY,4545840,4553000,so that they expand and inject value  into you and the world
0tIodVT4AfY,4554320,4561198,and then  lastly  there's trust
0tIodVT4AfY,4562159,4569199,sometimes the most difficult  seeing the unseen  maintaining confidence in that which is
0tIodVT4AfY,4569199,4574560,unknown  an incredibly challenging expectation in
0tIodVT4AfY,4574560,4580719,an instantaneous world a world where  things are immediate feedback is  immediate
0tIodVT4AfY,4580719,4587520,messages are sent across the planet  instantaneously  goods and services arrive within hours
0tIodVT4AfY,4587520,4594560,we have forgotten patience because it is  disintegrating before our very eyes
0tIodVT4AfY,4594560,4600640,we are a society  of now  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4600640,4606560,but the best  things in life they take time
0tIodVT4AfY,4606560,4613440,they require that we hold up our end of  the bargain and that we trust life will
0tIodVT4AfY,4613440,4620400,fall into place  [Music]  belief in a process that will come to
0tIodVT4AfY,4620400,4626880,mean more than anything that arrives in  30 seconds ever could
0tIodVT4AfY,4626960,4632320,a vision  the discipline to pursue it and a trust
0tIodVT4AfY,4632320,4638080,in the process  so perhaps you're overdue for your
0tIodVT4AfY,4638080,4643840,midday walk your little excursion into  the soul to ask yourself what is it you
0tIodVT4AfY,4643840,4649679,are moving towards  why are you doing what you're doing
0tIodVT4AfY,4649679,4655120,does it mean something and if not  perhaps some adjustment is in order
0tIodVT4AfY,4655120,4660320,perhaps you've lost sight of that north  star that lights up our lives and
0tIodVT4AfY,4660320,4667600,illuminates the way  take solace in the fact that life is not
0tIodVT4AfY,4667600,4673520,as serious as we make it out to be  we don't live in a world of right and
0tIodVT4AfY,4673520,4679440,wrong  good and bad yes and no but a continuum
0tIodVT4AfY,4679440,4685840,an opportunity to seek out and find the  beautiful ops and the meaningful downs
0tIodVT4AfY,4685840,4691360,to set our sights  on the horizons that matter
0tIodVT4AfY,4691360,4698080,see when the little things feel too  complex or burdensome  it's because the big things are
0tIodVT4AfY,4698080,4704840,misaligned  and that  is a powerful idea to
0tIodVT4AfY,4704840,4714400,grasp it's never that life is too  difficult  it's that we have closed our eyes
0tIodVT4AfY,4714800,4720400,so don't be fooled by those selling you  reality as some problem
0tIodVT4AfY,4720400,4726239,some obligation that must be dealt with  no today is the greatest gift of your
0tIodVT4AfY,4726239,4732840,lifetime  and the same will be true  every day moving
0tIodVT4AfY,4732840,4738000,forward  and to echo jim rohn absolutely it is a
0tIodVT4AfY,4738000,4743130,gift comprised of sacrifice  discomfort along the way
0tIodVT4AfY,4743130,4750640,[Music]  but that's a small price to pay for  entry to the show
0tIodVT4AfY,4750640,4755920,for the ability to embrace the mystery  and embark upon the adventure when
0tIodVT4AfY,4755920,4761600,you're pointed to the right north star  well the road
0tIodVT4AfY,4761600,4767920,it feels less treacherous on your feet  the hills less strenuous on your legs
0tIodVT4AfY,4767920,4774880,what we often deem to be a lack of  preparedness ability strength well might
0tIodVT4AfY,4774880,4780719,just be  a lack of alignment  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4780719,4786800,so adjust  because this world flexible and  limitless
0tIodVT4AfY,4786800,4792480,invites you to do just that  it invites you to explore
0tIodVT4AfY,4792480,4798800,until you've uncovered your vision  to pursue it like nothing else matters
0tIodVT4AfY,4798800,4805600,to sidestep the obstacles invert the  setbacks and lastly to find hope
0tIodVT4AfY,4805600,4811600,when there appears to be none  to set your sails walk your path run
0tIodVT4AfY,4811600,4817360,your race and surrender to that which is  beyond your control
0tIodVT4AfY,4817360,4822719,and you'll find that with a vision  with discipline with trust in the
0tIodVT4AfY,4822719,4830480,process there is no situation or  circumstance outside the scope
0tIodVT4AfY,4830480,4835880,of what's possible  for you
0tIodVT4AfY,4837810,4850199,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,4858719,4864400,the little e  on the car dashboard reminds me that i'm  pointed
0tIodVT4AfY,4864400,4871040,east  as i sit at the red light
0tIodVT4AfY,4871040,4877040,perpendicular to ocean ave staring out  at the water  this is it
0tIodVT4AfY,4877040,4883600,this is as far as i can go  there are no more streets or towns or
0tIodVT4AfY,4883600,4889120,cities  there can't be any more stops along the  way just
0tIodVT4AfY,4889120,4894800,miles  and miles  of ocean
0tIodVT4AfY,4896560,4902080,it's interesting for me to think  about all the changes i've made up to
0tIodVT4AfY,4902080,4907199,now  growing up outside of los angeles on the  opposite coast
0tIodVT4AfY,4907199,4913840,relocating again and again sometimes  very targeted methodical moves
0tIodVT4AfY,4913840,4918880,sometimes just for the sake of change  but  always moving
0tIodVT4AfY,4918880,4925120,always going  there's a saying that wherever you go
0tIodVT4AfY,4925120,4930960,you take yourself with you  right you can change the scenario the
0tIodVT4AfY,4930960,4936719,circumstances the surroundings but  ultimately  you can never
0tIodVT4AfY,4936719,4945560,outrun yourself you are accompanying you  on whatever journey awaits
0tIodVT4AfY,4945840,4951120,and it's often  not until you run out of real estate
0tIodVT4AfY,4951120,4957199,until there's no more road or options  that you're forced to look in the mirror
0tIodVT4AfY,4957199,4964239,and acknowledge that it is you who must  change  it's you who must evolve and become that
0tIodVT4AfY,4964239,4970960,person that  you need you  to become
0tIodVT4AfY,4971360,4977600,and that can be a scary thing  after all anyone can get in a car
0tIodVT4AfY,4977600,4985120,and head east anyone can point the  compass away from the chaos of now
0tIodVT4AfY,4985120,4989040,move away from their demons
0tIodVT4AfY,4990239,4995360,but how many of us can find the strength  to look those demons in the eye how many
0tIodVT4AfY,4995360,5002880,of us can make ourselves bigger  than what attempts to weigh us down
0tIodVT4AfY,5003199,5008800,all of us can  but how many of us do
0tIodVT4AfY,5009199,5014560,are we running  to something or from  something
0tIodVT4AfY,5014560,5020160,because there is a difference  and that difference is not  small
0tIodVT4AfY,5020160,5026960,[Music]  one of my favorite speakers jim rohn  when referencing our journeys through
0tIodVT4AfY,5026960,5035679,life our push to make more of ourselves  he essentially said  it's not what you get at the other end
0tIodVT4AfY,5035679,5042880,it's who you become along the way  [Music]  i think like everyone i've forgotten
0tIodVT4AfY,5042880,5047920,that from time to time over the years  forgotten that value is not simply in
0tIodVT4AfY,5047920,5055360,going but in becoming in the courageous  little steps that accumulate over time
0tIodVT4AfY,5055679,5060880,forgotten that the external world might  inspire or excite that change might
0tIodVT4AfY,5060880,5066320,invigorate the soul  that the road untraveled might remind me
0tIodVT4AfY,5066320,5072560,of life's beauty but  these externalities are only as valuable
0tIodVT4AfY,5072560,5080239,as you allow them to be  they're only opportunities if you decide  them to be so
0tIodVT4AfY,5080239,5087280,change inspires  but will you let it inspire you to do  that thing you know you need to do but
0tIodVT4AfY,5087280,5096560,are terrified of doing  and that road  it might remind you of life's beauty
0tIodVT4AfY,5096800,5102159,but will you let that reminder be your  invitation to share your own beauty with
0tIodVT4AfY,5102159,5106800,the world  whatever that means for you
0tIodVT4AfY,5107199,5112639,can you be that vulnerable  can you take that leap
0tIodVT4AfY,5112639,5120320,in the story of your becoming  see it is incredibly easy
0tIodVT4AfY,5120320,5126719,to look out at the world and pinpoint  its flaw  all those little problems and
0tIodVT4AfY,5126719,5134400,imperfections  they tend to jump out at us  but can you identify what you yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,5134400,5141040,need can you be courageous enough to ask  those questions of yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,5141040,5148159,what matters to me  what does a meaningful life look like to  me where am i falling short that is a
0tIodVT4AfY,5148159,5154880,conversation that needs to be had  and it needs to be had often otherwise
0tIodVT4AfY,5154880,5160320,we will drive  and drive and drive until we hit water
0tIodVT4AfY,5160320,5164960,in our force to ask that question
0tIodVT4AfY,5165760,5172960,because it's interesting that when we  don't pause  and make the changes that need to be  made life has a way of ensuring that we
0tIodVT4AfY,5172960,5178480,do  but when it's mandated by life it tends  to be a lot messier
0tIodVT4AfY,5178480,5185920,a lot more chaotic  at least then when we make the decision  ourselves but either way we cannot run
0tIodVT4AfY,5185920,5191520,forever  either way  we must step into a new pair of shoes
0tIodVT4AfY,5191520,5199189,and learn to walk confidently with them  into the night  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,5199440,5205840,there are plenty of  little mantras floating around out there  little pieces of advice and perhaps it's
0tIodVT4AfY,5205840,5211760,best for us to weigh them each  individually see what meets our needs  and fits our criteria
0tIodVT4AfY,5211760,5218800,after all life is not one size fits all  so one of my favorite among these is to
0tIodVT4AfY,5218800,5225280,do one single thing that scares you  every day and i'll tell you why
0tIodVT4AfY,5225280,5232639,because when we become conditioned  to turning our backs on all the  uncomfortable things in life
0tIodVT4AfY,5232639,5238400,we our prospects of a better  tomorrow  it's synonymous with the seed refusing
0tIodVT4AfY,5238400,5244639,water saying no to the very thing it  needs most  and what should be noted here one of the
0tIodVT4AfY,5244639,5251360,reasons it's so dangerous  is that saying no is incredibly subtle
0tIodVT4AfY,5251360,5258800,it's not some big event or explosion  there's no firework show that occurs  every time you walk away from what you
0tIodVT4AfY,5258800,5264080,need  no it goes unnoticed
0tIodVT4AfY,5264080,5270480,and again one of the greatest challenges  is quantifying that which we don't do  how do you measure that thing you walked
0tIodVT4AfY,5270480,5276719,away from  well unfortunately you can't
0tIodVT4AfY,5276719,5284639,you can't at least until you're staring  out at the atlantic with nowhere to run  no more escaping on the agenda
0tIodVT4AfY,5284639,5292480,you don't know until you're forced to  pick the pieces up  and make something of them
0tIodVT4AfY,5292480,5300320,and i say this  so that hopefully it can ignite that  spark in your soul that you need most
0tIodVT4AfY,5300320,5306800,whether you previously recognized it or  not  i say this to remind you how much bigger
0tIodVT4AfY,5306800,5311840,you are than your problems  how you have the ability to transform
0tIodVT4AfY,5311840,5317570,all that exists around you when you  transform yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,5317570,5324400,[Music]  there's a certain inevitability  associated with how we see ourselves
0tIodVT4AfY,5324400,5331760,and i believe this to be true at both  the personal and the societal levels  anyone can look in the mirror and see
0tIodVT4AfY,5331760,5338320,the past  where they've gone wrong how inadequate  and ill-prepared they are
0tIodVT4AfY,5338320,5345120,but the courage  to look in the mirror and see  strength
0tIodVT4AfY,5345120,5354000,to both identify and understand one's  shortcomings but know that you have the  power to do something about it
0tIodVT4AfY,5354000,5360560,to know that the times you fell or  didn't make the cut they don't indicate  that the endeavor was all for naught or
0tIodVT4AfY,5360560,5367360,unequivocally wrong  no there is so much good tied into your
0tIodVT4AfY,5367360,5374400,pursuit  so much beauty and courage ingrained in  your soul
0tIodVT4AfY,5374400,5381840,but imagine  imagine a life where you no longer run  from the gaps but close them
0tIodVT4AfY,5381840,5389040,imagine finding it in yourself to begin  that hero's journey  and where you used to run to protect
0tIodVT4AfY,5389040,5394560,yourself now you take the offensive to  grow yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,5394560,5400719,where you used to avoid the possibility  of failure now you chase the possibility
0tIodVT4AfY,5400719,5406960,of victory  [Music]  you can have that
0tIodVT4AfY,5406960,5412400,if you want to  you can be that if you choose to ensure
0tIodVT4AfY,5412400,5420639,you may never be able to outrun yourself  but you can always adapt yourself to be
0tIodVT4AfY,5420639,5426400,that person you always needed you to be
0tIodVT4AfY,5426800,5432719,sometimes we just need the reminder that  we are strong enough
0tIodVT4AfY,5432719,5437920,we do have what it takes  and that the thing that hurts us most in
0tIodVT4AfY,5437920,5446000,the short term  not only saves us pain in the long term  but it becomes what we live for it is
0tIodVT4AfY,5446000,5450719,where we find our meaning
0tIodVT4AfY,5452000,5457199,and so perhaps this ocean  before me is not there to remind me of
0tIodVT4AfY,5457199,5465360,my constraints  that i have no road left but a reminder  of just how often we measure using the
0tIodVT4AfY,5465360,5472719,wrong metrics  perhaps i needed to see again that it's  not where i end up but who i become
0tIodVT4AfY,5472719,5478000,along the way  that when the internal self steps into
0tIodVT4AfY,5478000,5484880,the shoes it's been too intimidated to  wear  that when the world within becomes the
0tIodVT4AfY,5484880,5491920,beacon you need it to be  the roads  and the stops along the way they matter
0tIodVT4AfY,5491920,5498239,a little bit less than the eyes that  process it all that decide what it means
0tIodVT4AfY,5498239,5505760,how it will be utilized in the game of  life  and so yes the little e on the car
0tIodVT4AfY,5505760,5513120,dashboard it says that i'm pointed east  but as i sit at this red light
0tIodVT4AfY,5513120,5520560,perpendicular to ocean abs staring out  at the water
0tIodVT4AfY,5520880,5528170,i know  this is only the beginning
0tIodVT4AfY,5528170,5539790,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,5570239,5576320,everyone wants to be great  everyone wants to be the best
0tIodVT4AfY,5576320,5581600,the top the one percent  or as the saying goes
0tIodVT4AfY,5581600,5587040,everyone wants to be a beast  until it's time to do what beasts
0tIodVT4AfY,5587040,5592560,do  see what life has revealed
0tIodVT4AfY,5592560,5599840,and continues to emphasize  is that our most  vital decisions
0tIodVT4AfY,5599840,5606320,they present themselves in the dark of  night  the chaos of the battle they show up
0tIodVT4AfY,5606320,5613679,amidst our discomfort we know these  moments  the ones that seek to stop us in our
0tIodVT4AfY,5613679,5619600,tracks and turn us around  they are what must be prepared for they
0tIodVT4AfY,5619600,5626080,are the gateway  to excellence  so let's look at the big picture for a
0tIodVT4AfY,5626080,5632719,minute life in totality  because consistently doing this simple  easy things
0tIodVT4AfY,5632719,5638800,they're important  consistency of that which is simple
0tIodVT4AfY,5638800,5646000,is the foundation it's what we build the  structure upon but it is far  from everything
0tIodVT4AfY,5646000,5652080,moving right along we have the difficult  things  that push us to be more that show us who
0tIodVT4AfY,5652080,5657840,we are that hurt that test us the  temporary storms
0tIodVT4AfY,5657840,5664000,they are the armor we come to wear  they're what prepares us to endure the
0tIodVT4AfY,5664000,5669199,trials and tribulations of life like a  muscle that must be grown and developed
0tIodVT4AfY,5669199,5675120,but the difficult things  are far from everything
0tIodVT4AfY,5675280,5681360,because lastly  we have our defining moments
0tIodVT4AfY,5681360,5687119,the moments that put it all together  when the sky feels like it's falling the
0tIodVT4AfY,5687119,5693600,body feels like it's failing the mind  feels like it's dwindling
0tIodVT4AfY,5693600,5699440,presenting the question  will you do the hard thing when you feel
0tIodVT4AfY,5699440,5705119,like you can't do the hard thing  it's doing what's difficult
0tIodVT4AfY,5705119,5710880,when the situation around you is  screaming at the top of its lungs
0tIodVT4AfY,5710880,5716639,you've gone too far you've separated  from normalcy you are wandering into
0tIodVT4AfY,5716639,5723360,something that can no longer be deemed  predictable  or safe
0tIodVT4AfY,5723760,5729119,see running is hard  but running when you're tired
0tIodVT4AfY,5729119,5736320,when you didn't get a great sleep last  night you don't feel good when you're  busy when your schedule's full when you
0tIodVT4AfY,5736320,5743040,have things to do  when you're in the midst of your workout  and your lungs are screaming for air the
0tIodVT4AfY,5743040,5748639,cloud of pain is hovering over you as  you make your way forward for no other
0tIodVT4AfY,5748639,5754320,reason  then you told yourself you would
0tIodVT4AfY,5754320,5762639,that's not hard that's transformative  going to the gym is hard
0tIodVT4AfY,5762639,5768239,but going to the gym when you don't want  to  when you don't even feel like stepping
0tIodVT4AfY,5768239,5773760,into the car when your mind is trying to  rationalize a day off when you're asking
0tIodVT4AfY,5773760,5780400,yourself what the point was to begin  with  that's not hard
0tIodVT4AfY,5780400,5786080,that's transformative  growing your business is hard
0tIodVT4AfY,5786080,5792080,but growing your business when you've  experienced a monumental letdown
0tIodVT4AfY,5792080,5798719,when you went all in and were left  empty-handed  when you were chewed up and spit back
0tIodVT4AfY,5798719,5806000,out yet you showed up  kept your eyes locked in on that wind
0tIodVT4AfY,5806000,5812719,that's not hard that is transformative  see these monumental moments
0tIodVT4AfY,5812719,5818320,the ones that break so many of us  that we've all come face to face with
0tIodVT4AfY,5818320,5824159,over the course of our lives  they're not about easy versus heart
0tIodVT4AfY,5824159,5829760,they're about doing the hard thing  when it seems as though you cannot do
0tIodVT4AfY,5829760,5836159,the hard thing  the world is saying no  your body is saying no that chirping in
0tIodVT4AfY,5836159,5841920,your head is saying no  can you separate yourself from that hurt
0tIodVT4AfY,5841920,5849199,and that anger and that disappointment  can you segment the negativity knowing  that you will do what you can to remedy
0tIodVT4AfY,5849199,5855679,this situation  but that life's curveballs can't stop  you from moving forward for the simple
0tIodVT4AfY,5855679,5860719,reason that you won't let them  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,5860719,5866000,when life gets hard  you have to be harder
0tIodVT4AfY,5866000,5871040,the one who gets bolder  you have to learn to surprise yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,5871040,5880000,here is what i believe to be the goal  the pinnacle it's what i aspire to  become when life puts me through hell
0tIodVT4AfY,5880000,5886719,to dig deep and find the emotional iq  the awareness  to know that right now
0tIodVT4AfY,5886719,5892800,is the invitation i've been longing for  my chance to level up
0tIodVT4AfY,5892800,5900639,so you might be wondering what brought  this concept to the forefront of my mind  and well it was one of life's inevitable
0tIodVT4AfY,5900639,5905920,setbacks and i had to look in the mirror  and say i'm not going to think about the
0tIodVT4AfY,5905920,5911920,technical issues that just cost me  thousands of dollars and thousands of  hours of my time no i'm going to one
0tIodVT4AfY,5911920,5918400,learn  but put parameters in place so it never  happens again and to find the
0tIodVT4AfY,5918400,5925760,opportunity  see when we build back we tend to build  back stronger clean slate new lease on
0tIodVT4AfY,5925760,5931679,life where can i be better than i was  where can i pinpoint and capitalize on
0tIodVT4AfY,5931679,5938920,the value i once walked right by
0tIodVT4AfY,5939280,5945440,when we adopt this mentality we become  unstoppable someone on the outside
0tIodVT4AfY,5945440,5952400,looking in might say it's over the top  and it is  but so are the things that i want they
0tIodVT4AfY,5952400,5957440,might say it's not that simple  correct running away from our problems
0tIodVT4AfY,5957440,5963280,is simple i'm not about that life  they might say it's impossible to do all
0tIodVT4AfY,5963280,5971199,the time to think that way every day and  perhaps  so  but if we bow our heads and retreat
0tIodVT4AfY,5971199,5976239,every time life isn't perfect we'll  never attempt anything i'm not aiming
0tIodVT4AfY,5976239,5981520,for perfection i'm aiming for progress  those who aim for perfection tend to
0tIodVT4AfY,5981520,5990320,spend the entirety of their lives doing  exactly that aiming planning speculating
0tIodVT4AfY,5990320,5999199,wanting more for yourself means  receiving more rejection from the world  it means elongated valleys of despair
0tIodVT4AfY,5999199,6006400,it means deeper treks through the heart  of the vast unknown across distant lands
0tIodVT4AfY,6006400,6012040,and through turbulent waters it means  doing the hard thing when the
0tIodVT4AfY,6012040,6018639,circumstances are what mere mortals call  impossible
0tIodVT4AfY,6018639,6024159,at some point we must transcend the  versions of ourselves we once were we
0tIodVT4AfY,6024159,6029760,must re-categorize and redefine the  adversity we face in life
0tIodVT4AfY,6029760,6036000,be the ones who find something where  others see nothing find value in the
0tIodVT4AfY,6036000,6041520,seemingly valueless let us start from  the premonition that there is always a
0tIodVT4AfY,6041520,6047199,solution and if there is always a  solution there is always a way to bring
0tIodVT4AfY,6047199,6054719,it to existence  some will stop it easy fine let them
0tIodVT4AfY,6054719,6060960,some will stop it hard great to each  their own but if one dares to push
0tIodVT4AfY,6060960,6068239,further to trudge forth into the night  they will be tasked with doing the hard
0tIodVT4AfY,6068239,6073760,thing when the circumstances are  devastating they will be asked not just
0tIodVT4AfY,6073760,6081199,to sail the ship but to sail it through  the storm to not just build the tower
0tIodVT4AfY,6081199,6088080,but to build as the skies open up the  wind blows and the ground shakes that
0tIodVT4AfY,6088080,6094159,will be the difference that has always  been the difference so what will you do
0tIodVT4AfY,6094159,6099840,when the time arises who will you choose
0tIodVT4AfY,6099840,6103000,to become
0tIodVT4AfY,6124800,6132000,[Music]  in his play measure for measure
0tIodVT4AfY,6132000,6137520,shakespeare wrote in 1603  a line that i think adequately sums up
0tIodVT4AfY,6137520,6143520,the reason so many of us fall short of  what we are capable of becoming
0tIodVT4AfY,6143520,6150239,he wrote our doubts are traitors  and make us lose the good we oft might
0tIodVT4AfY,6150239,6155520,win  by fearing to attempt
0tIodVT4AfY,6156660,6164080,[Music]  our greatest tragedies  and regrets in life
0tIodVT4AfY,6164080,6171760,tend not to be our mistakes  they're not when we try and we falter
0tIodVT4AfY,6171760,6177740,now the vast majority of the time they  arise when we do not even attempt
0tIodVT4AfY,6177740,6184639,[Music]  because fear is prevented that very  first step
0tIodVT4AfY,6185440,6193440,it's when we have that perpetual light  shined on all that can go wrong  while the upside and the opportunity
0tIodVT4AfY,6193440,6198880,sits in the dark  just out of frame  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,6198880,6205520,and in a world where you get what you  focus on  to only focus on the worst possible
0tIodVT4AfY,6205520,6212880,outcome it's a death sentence  it's debilitating
0tIodVT4AfY,6214159,6220560,the way i see it there are a million  ways to improve something  there are infinite roads and paths and
0tIodVT4AfY,6220560,6227840,possibilities  none are certain  but what is
0tIodVT4AfY,6227840,6233440,here's the interesting thing though the  only certainty the only thing that is
0tIodVT4AfY,6233440,6239840,for sure  is that if you don't go you will not  arrive
0tIodVT4AfY,6239840,6246960,one will never finish  what they do not start
0tIodVT4AfY,6246960,6253760,listen to this quote from thoreau  it's from his book walden  which he wrote
0tIodVT4AfY,6253760,6260080,after about two years and two months of  living in the woods by walden pond in  concord massachusetts
0tIodVT4AfY,6260080,6265360,he wrote i learned this at least by my  experiment
0tIodVT4AfY,6265360,6270800,that if one advances confidently in the  direction of his dreams
0tIodVT4AfY,6270800,6276719,and endeavors to live the life which he  has imagined he will meet with a success
0tIodVT4AfY,6276719,6283840,unexpected in common hours  he will put some things behind
0tIodVT4AfY,6283840,6291360,will pass an invisible boundary  new universal and more liberal laws will
0tIodVT4AfY,6291360,6296880,begin to establish themselves around and  within him
0tIodVT4AfY,6296880,6303040,or the old laws be expanded and  interpreted in his favor
0tIodVT4AfY,6303040,6308719,in a more liberal sense  [Music]  in other words
0tIodVT4AfY,6308719,6317760,the world does not dictate  it reacts  it becomes what we decide it will be
0tIodVT4AfY,6317760,6324239,and i was thinking about this recently  uh have you ever thought about the  utility of water
0tIodVT4AfY,6324239,6329840,just water  and how it is obviously essential for
0tIodVT4AfY,6329840,6336320,life  specifically humans can't live longer  than  about three days without it
0tIodVT4AfY,6336320,6342560,yet  we can also very easily drown  in too much of it
0tIodVT4AfY,6342560,6350880,the same thing that's required for life  can easily take life away it all depends  on how it's being utilized
0tIodVT4AfY,6350880,6358480,and so when i think about this my mind  goes to shakespeare's message on our  doubts making us traitors if we let them
0tIodVT4AfY,6358480,6366000,arthro's passage about moving with  conviction towards the things that  matter towards our dreams
0tIodVT4AfY,6366800,6373119,and what i see is an intentional  restructuring of the world around us
0tIodVT4AfY,6373119,6379920,the idea that life can work for us or  work against us  it can be our headwind
0tIodVT4AfY,6379920,6389119,or our tailwind the reason we stay or  the reason we leave and who decides that
0tIodVT4AfY,6389360,6394880,you  you decide that
0tIodVT4AfY,6394880,6400320,i often think back to my first creative  project once i took the entrepreneurial
0tIodVT4AfY,6400320,6406239,route years and years back  i referred to the project as quiet
0tIodVT4AfY,6406239,6412080,desperation  in reference to actually another  thorough quote most men lead lives of
0tIodVT4AfY,6412080,6418880,quiet desperation  because i realized around that time how  easily that could become reality
0tIodVT4AfY,6418880,6424080,and decided to do something about it for  me it was a huge step out of the routine
0tIodVT4AfY,6424080,6430960,in the cycle i finally  finally asked myself who i was living  for
0tIodVT4AfY,6430960,6436560,where did i lose myself  or had i simply never bothered
0tIodVT4AfY,6436560,6442719,to find myself  and i don't know the answer to that but  i know at the time if you ask me you
0tIodVT4AfY,6442719,6448239,know eddie what are you truly excited  about  probably be a lot easier for me to tell
0tIodVT4AfY,6448239,6455360,you about the things i didn't like i was  afraid of that i was unhappy with  that's what i saw that's what i focused
0tIodVT4AfY,6455360,6462560,on and that's the point  until then i was immersed in thoreau's  dreaded common hour thinking
0tIodVT4AfY,6462560,6468840,and so used to it that i thought nothing  of it there was no next step or other
0tIodVT4AfY,6468840,6475600,side  and then i arrived at that moment that  moment i hope we all get to at some
0tIodVT4AfY,6475600,6481199,point  realizing there's very little to lose  and everything
0tIodVT4AfY,6481199,6487520,to gain  and it drives me crazy how hard we have  to fight for this understanding
0tIodVT4AfY,6487520,6492800,how much easier life would be if it was  intuitive but it's not it's a journey a
0tIodVT4AfY,6492800,6498719,muscle that must be built and so we must  build
0tIodVT4AfY,6498719,6503760,we have to prove to ourselves that  what's big and intimidating can be
0tIodVT4AfY,6503760,6513119,broken down  that what we visualize can materialize  that will always be true
0tIodVT4AfY,6513119,6520239,but we we need to make ourselves believe  it  identity is scripted confidence is
0tIodVT4AfY,6520239,6526639,earned not once but every  day and we must understand the pain
0tIodVT4AfY,6526639,6531679,associated with staying  far exceeds the pain associated with
0tIodVT4AfY,6531679,6538080,moving towards our dreams the former is  destructive and the latter is what we
0tIodVT4AfY,6538080,6545340,need they are not the same  so being as we choose what we see
0tIodVT4AfY,6545340,6552159,[Music]  how about a commitment  not a commitment to be perfect
0tIodVT4AfY,6552159,6559280,not a commitment to have all the answers  or avoid mistakes  no how about a commitment to allow
0tIodVT4AfY,6559280,6566560,ourselves the courage to be imperfect  a commitment to go when we don't have
0tIodVT4AfY,6566560,6575080,the answers a commitment to see mistakes  as a necessity instead of a catastrophe
0tIodVT4AfY,6575760,6581119,in this world of subjectivity  make sure that movie
0tIodVT4AfY,6581119,6586719,playing in your head illuminates the  opportunity not the loss
0tIodVT4AfY,6586719,6591760,so that when you fall the inclination  isn't to run from the bad but to look
0tIodVT4AfY,6591760,6597760,for the good because i promise you you  will get what you look for
0tIodVT4AfY,6597760,6602960,that perspective will alter your actions  which will alter how you see yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,6602960,6610800,which will alter the trajectory of your  life  let's leave that mediocrity that common
0tIodVT4AfY,6610800,6616880,hour thinking behind as we head for  higher ground
0tIodVT4AfY,6616880,6623440,commonality being average it's a wolf in  sheep's clothing it seems simpler sure
0tIodVT4AfY,6623440,6628639,it seems easier  but the ones immersed in that world
0tIodVT4AfY,6628639,6635320,they're depriving themselves of the  answers they desperately need they're  refusing the hand that is
0tIodVT4AfY,6635320,6643679,perpetually reaching out  when we turn our backs on the  extraordinary it is because fear has
0tIodVT4AfY,6643679,6649840,gripped the wheel  and we are now passengers along for the  ride
0tIodVT4AfY,6649920,6655119,but you have the ability to be more you  have the ability to move towards what
0tIodVT4AfY,6655119,6662560,matters to you  to take the steps one at a time  bear the discomfort one second at a time
0tIodVT4AfY,6662560,6669119,acclimate one day at a time this is a  journey dependent entirely on you and
0tIodVT4AfY,6669119,6675840,your willingness to step out the front  door  to finally see the things you previously
0tIodVT4AfY,6675840,6681199,disregarded  and when your eyes open you'll see that
0tIodVT4AfY,6681199,6686719,you can be your ally or your enemy this  can be the beginning of a new chapter or
0tIodVT4AfY,6686719,6693119,the continuation of a current one this  is your story  and by the way
0tIodVT4AfY,6693119,6699840,that doesn't mean others wouldn't love  to make it theirs wouldn't love to tell  you that life is beyond your control
0tIodVT4AfY,6699840,6705599,wouldn't love for you to think that you  are dependent on the outside world that  you need them and what they are willing
0tIodVT4AfY,6705599,6712639,to provide for you but no this is about  you  understanding that the first step starts
0tIodVT4AfY,6712639,6717840,with you your decision that your  autonomy is a strength and a chance to
0tIodVT4AfY,6717840,6725760,begin again  change the way you think  and what you get changes it's not magic
0tIodVT4AfY,6725760,6733679,but  practical evolution  when we force ourselves to see the  positive when we look for a way
0tIodVT4AfY,6733679,6740880,we  find it  that's reality changing
0tIodVT4AfY,6740880,6746480,because you decided that it should  and that's what the power of perception
0tIodVT4AfY,6746480,6753840,is  nothing more than unlocking the gate  that was previously placed before you
0tIodVT4AfY,6753920,6759720,there's no better time than this very  moment  to walk through it
0tIodVT4AfY,6759720,6765760,[Music]  and rewrite your story  as it should
0tIodVT4AfY,6765760,6768920,be written
0tIodVT4AfY,6780480,6787790,here's an idea that's changed my life  right as  uh has been attributed to nelson mandela
0tIodVT4AfY,6787790,6794080,[Music]  the saying goes everything is impossible  until it's done
0tIodVT4AfY,6794080,6801199,right we view  impossibility  as this abstract scary
0tIodVT4AfY,6801199,6809119,concept implying that something cannot  happen that it's it's not reality it's  outside the scope of what we are capable
0tIodVT4AfY,6809119,6816719,of doing or creating and we feel that  we feel that uh when we're we're in the
0tIodVT4AfY,6816719,6823119,middle of life's trials and tribulations  and we feel that push pull  you know we feel that when we're working
0tIodVT4AfY,6823119,6829280,on something and we feel unvalidated  we feel like  everything's in vain like we're putting
0tIodVT4AfY,6829280,6835199,in time and energy where's life  rewarding us  where is that
0tIodVT4AfY,6835199,6840239,uh you know the the top of the mountain  the metal where's the applause i cannot
0tIodVT4AfY,6840239,6847599,find it when we feel that  you know the  solution seems impossible nothing short
0tIodVT4AfY,6847599,6854560,of impossible  and what i want to do is kind of debunk  that idea and show you how that abstract
0tIodVT4AfY,6854560,6861119,notion of something that just seems too  big it seems it just seems  insurmountable how you can take that and
0tIodVT4AfY,6861119,6867520,break it down into very doable  manageable  daily
0tIodVT4AfY,6867520,6874239,tasks  that change  your life and your relationship with the
0tIodVT4AfY,6874239,6880400,word  you know there's uh i want to give you  two examples
0tIodVT4AfY,6880400,6887040,of books that i've read and i've talked  about them a little bit  on the channel before
0tIodVT4AfY,6887040,6894320,but i don't think in this context of  how human beings
0tIodVT4AfY,6894320,6899440,have done  impossible quote unquote impossible  things
0tIodVT4AfY,6899440,6905280,and not even realized it until they  stepped outside  right until they crossed some finish
0tIodVT4AfY,6905280,6912080,line some abstract marker looked back  and went oh my god and the rest of the  world went oh my god
0tIodVT4AfY,6912080,6917840,that's not that's not realistic  you know and what's incredible is as the
0tIodVT4AfY,6917840,6923040,impossible was being done  the steps to get there were so small and
0tIodVT4AfY,6923040,6928639,so commonplace  that  the people carrying out the impossible
0tIodVT4AfY,6928639,6935599,acts didn't even understand didn't know  they were just putting one foot in front  of the other and so both stories are uh
0tIodVT4AfY,6935599,6941040,are related to war  uh and and i feel like  when you
0tIodVT4AfY,6941040,6946960,take sort of the  darkest elements of  mankind
0tIodVT4AfY,6946960,6953840,stuff that's inconceivable to a lot of  us  and you you see how
0tIodVT4AfY,6954000,6960400,people were able to  get through those situations it puts  things into perspective
0tIodVT4AfY,6960400,6965920,right we're not dodging bullets here in  our own world  um
0tIodVT4AfY,6965920,6972480,and and and that idea you know it helps  ground us right so the first is laura
0tIodVT4AfY,6972480,6978480,hillenbrand's book unbroken  and uh  louise zamperini is the main character
0tIodVT4AfY,6978480,6986400,in that book  it's one of my favorite books  and he's a track star that
0tIodVT4AfY,6986400,6991440,ultimately goes to fight  in the war and his uh plane is shot down
0tIodVT4AfY,6991440,6998239,he goes to a japanese internment camp  and just endures hell mental and  physical torture he's beaten he's
0tIodVT4AfY,6998239,7004639,starved uh he's he's isolated  just goes through
0tIodVT4AfY,7004639,7010080,a mental  hell from camp to camp to camp
0tIodVT4AfY,7010080,7017040,day by day  sometimes thinking he would die really  not knowing malnourished
0tIodVT4AfY,7017040,7022239,watching people around him die  get beaten like it's it's a an
0tIodVT4AfY,7022239,7028880,environment that  would be hard for us to comprehend
0tIodVT4AfY,7028880,7034880,and one part really struck me in this  story it's when at the end
0tIodVT4AfY,7034880,7041599,of the war  the prisoners are set free and he's  talking to someone about the trip
0tIodVT4AfY,7041599,7047280,and  looks back and says i'd rather die than  do that again like i couldn't do that
0tIodVT4AfY,7047280,7053360,again  it's quote unquote impossible and i  don't think he used that word but that's
0tIodVT4AfY,7053360,7059760,the implication right there's just no  way  and it's like as as even as the reader
0tIodVT4AfY,7059760,7064800,as you look back you're like there's  that  is is not something a human being can
0tIodVT4AfY,7064800,7071679,endure it just seems like too much when  you look at holistically  but what the prisoners did
0tIodVT4AfY,7071679,7076800,was take it one day at a time one awful  horrific
0tIodVT4AfY,7076800,7081920,grueling unfathomable day at a time  for
0tIodVT4AfY,7081920,7090239,years  and then when the point finally came
0tIodVT4AfY,7090239,7096719,you know they looked back and realized  that what they had done  was
0tIodVT4AfY,7096719,7102800,unbelievable  one day at a time
0tIodVT4AfY,7102800,7109920,and it was just it was heart-wrenching  it was so powerful to have him look back  on his own journey and say that's impos
0tIodVT4AfY,7109920,7116639,like i could never do that again i would  rather die than do that again that's how  hard it was that's how
0tIodVT4AfY,7116639,7123280,just traumatic it was  [Music]  yet here he was standing
0tIodVT4AfY,7123280,7128480,tall  another example
0tIodVT4AfY,7128480,7133760,is in the book lone survivor  marcus latrell
0tIodVT4AfY,7133760,7140400,is a navy seal  and  you know he's he's in afghanistan
0tIodVT4AfY,7140400,7146239,with three other navy seals  who are killed in action and there's a
0tIodVT4AfY,7146239,7152080,point where he is by himself um  bit through his tongue he had a broken
0tIodVT4AfY,7152080,7157840,back he was mangled  and  he crawls  seven
0tIodVT4AfY,7157840,7163119,miles  through the mountains in afghanistan  while being shot at and taking enemy
0tIodVT4AfY,7163119,7168079,fire  and
0tIodVT4AfY,7168239,7174320,the portrayal  of just slowly moving your body forward
0tIodVT4AfY,7174320,7180320,inch by inch  to safety  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7180320,7187760,again is something that's unfathomable  that's impossible that's not something  that we can comprehend i don't even  think it's something he can comprehend
0tIodVT4AfY,7187760,7194400,right and i'm certainly not going to  speak for  for for a navy seal but the the idea is
0tIodVT4AfY,7194400,7202560,it's  it's just unfathomable  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7203840,7209920,but one step at a time one movement at a  time
0tIodVT4AfY,7209920,7216000,you can create a different reality  so when you take these examples and you
0tIodVT4AfY,7216000,7221280,pull them back down to earth  uh you know viktor frankl has a
0tIodVT4AfY,7221280,7227520,he talks about in his book how suffering  is like  a gas that will fill any room right it's
0tIodVT4AfY,7227520,7234400,like everyone's suffering  uh  consumes them to some extent
0tIodVT4AfY,7234400,7240719,and so you may not be at war but we are  all fighting our own battles and when we
0tIodVT4AfY,7240719,7247440,are in the midst  of the difficult times  it's easy
0tIodVT4AfY,7247440,7253599,to not think about uh getting to  tomorrow but think about surviving uh
0tIodVT4AfY,7253599,7260000,the whole war metaphorical war  right not just crawling one foot
0tIodVT4AfY,7260000,7266719,but looking at the seven mile marker and  thinking it's outrageous so much of life
0tIodVT4AfY,7266880,7273440,is convincing yourself to move forward  one step  and it's it's just it's such a trivial
0tIodVT4AfY,7273440,7282840,thing to discuss it's it's not sexy it's  not uh on its face heroic or exciting
0tIodVT4AfY,7283440,7288480,it's the mundane compounded over time
0tIodVT4AfY,7289280,7295440,and  we need to remember it most when it's  hardest to understand
0tIodVT4AfY,7295440,7302080,and i talk about it all the time  right that nietzsche quote those who  were seen dancing were thought to be  insane by those who could not hear the
0tIodVT4AfY,7302080,7307440,music it is very difficult  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7307440,7312719,to  uh stay fixated
0tIodVT4AfY,7312719,7318239,on a result that is not there  it's one of the most challenging things
0tIodVT4AfY,7318239,7323360,about changing your life in the world  around you
0tIodVT4AfY,7323520,7330320,you know dreaming  is putting things on earth that are not  yet on earth
0tIodVT4AfY,7330320,7336320,that takes mental fortitude  because each step you take
0tIodVT4AfY,7336320,7342559,you have to remind yourself that it's  for something that it means something
0tIodVT4AfY,7342880,7349840,when you desperately want applause  because look it's human  you exert yourself you exhaust enough
0tIodVT4AfY,7349840,7355840,energy any rational person is going to  say why the hell have the stars not
0tIodVT4AfY,7355840,7361449,aligned yet i don't understand what i  need to do  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7362800,7370719,that's what's interesting  people don't talk about the fact that it  makes more sense to quit
0tIodVT4AfY,7370880,7376800,than to carry on  like to the rational brain it makes
0tIodVT4AfY,7376800,7381920,sense  that we would say no more  right i want to deal with the world that
0tIodVT4AfY,7381920,7386880,i'm in  not one that isn't built yet
0tIodVT4AfY,7387760,7393920,but it's why we celebrate we celebrate  those times that we move forward anyway
0tIodVT4AfY,7393920,7400560,that we have the vision to see the  unseen and do what so few people can do
0tIodVT4AfY,7401760,7410880,that's what makes life beautiful that's  what makes human beings beautiful  you know we see life through stories
0tIodVT4AfY,7410880,7416880,well the ones that can write  and craft narratives that have not been
0tIodVT4AfY,7416880,7422280,heard or watched or explored
0tIodVT4AfY,7422960,7429679,that's magic  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7429679,7435360,i talk about the evolution of insanity  i
0tIodVT4AfY,7435360,7440960,i wrote about this years ago and it  continues to be one of the most  important things i think
0tIodVT4AfY,7440960,7448159,uh  that i've written  you know this idea  if you take a woman who
0tIodVT4AfY,7448159,7454000,leaves her everyday life right for for  example  and
0tIodVT4AfY,7454000,7460400,she has this  this passion  this sense of purpose
0tIodVT4AfY,7460400,7466239,and she wants to breathe life into it so  she leaves her ordinary world
0tIodVT4AfY,7466239,7472639,and she starts building  and she becomes obsessed  with this idea
0tIodVT4AfY,7472639,7478000,and people around her  by the way who know her as what she was
0tIodVT4AfY,7478000,7483360,and what she did  right they know her  based on what they saw yesterday they
0tIodVT4AfY,7483360,7488880,say this is  weird  but she's locked in and she gets up and
0tIodVT4AfY,7488880,7494000,she makes it her focus in life and she  continues forward and continues forward
0tIodVT4AfY,7494000,7500560,and nothing happens  [Music]  and people's point to her they say look  at her wasting her time
0tIodVT4AfY,7500560,7507679,right she had it all before  this is crazy  and she continues and continues and
0tIodVT4AfY,7507679,7513360,builds and adjusts and throws her her  understandings and her
0tIodVT4AfY,7513360,7520320,knowledge and her experiences against  the wall and when they shatter she picks  them up and builds again and again and
0tIodVT4AfY,7520320,7527290,again and people say she's delusional  she's insane she has lost her mind
0tIodVT4AfY,7527290,7534280,[Music]  but she hangs in
0tIodVT4AfY,7536719,7543520,she dances without the music long enough  to get there
0tIodVT4AfY,7543520,7549239,so wherever there is she gets there
0tIodVT4AfY,7550639,7556000,and now the perception's different  now it's exciting
0tIodVT4AfY,7556000,7562800,now she's not insane  to the world around her now she's  propped up on a pedestal now people want
0tIodVT4AfY,7562800,7567920,what she has they want to understand how  to build what she built how can we make
0tIodVT4AfY,7567920,7572800,what she made how can we do what she did
0tIodVT4AfY,7575040,7578400,right they call her lucky
0tIodVT4AfY,7581040,7588158,she says no  for you to call me lucky  is insane
0tIodVT4AfY,7589760,7596800,what she did was build the impossible  with very ordinary
0tIodVT4AfY,7596800,7603280,very mundane steps never losing faith  and remembering and this is the key
0tIodVT4AfY,7603280,7608480,concept remembering that all those  little trivial steps mean something and
0tIodVT4AfY,7608480,7616480,when she steps outside because we all  get there we will step outside and look  back and reflect
0tIodVT4AfY,7617440,7622480,we'll look back on the impossible that  we built
0tIodVT4AfY,7622800,7630880,on the magic we created the thing is the  thing we need to remember that magic is  manufactured with very real
0tIodVT4AfY,7630880,7637760,practical  components of life  simple decisions
0tIodVT4AfY,7638480,7643840,it's like the human brain  is so much more than the sum of its
0tIodVT4AfY,7643840,7650159,parts  right you can take any element uh you  know physically of the human brain and
0tIodVT4AfY,7650159,7657280,it it doesn't seem  that extraordinary we can't even explain  or understand it but you put it together
0tIodVT4AfY,7657280,7664000,and  we have something that transcends uh the
0tIodVT4AfY,7664000,7669199,the biology in the physicality uh that  we look at under a microscope it doesn't
0tIodVT4AfY,7669199,7675280,make sense we haven't quite figured it  out  right all those little pieces become
0tIodVT4AfY,7675280,7680480,something meaningful  and my point is
0tIodVT4AfY,7680480,7686960,we all have our own journey we're all  fighting our own battles we all are  going to get to a point because it's
0tIodVT4AfY,7686960,7693199,human and in a way it's required where  we look around and we question ourselves
0tIodVT4AfY,7693199,7700239,and we question the process and we don't  know if it's worth it  we forget why we started
0tIodVT4AfY,7700239,7705679,we can't see the finish line  because it's not there yet and we'll
0tIodVT4AfY,7705679,7713679,only see it  if we continue to  uphold that vision in our heads
0tIodVT4AfY,7713679,7718719,that's when it's important to remember  what impossible is and how it's made and
0tIodVT4AfY,7718719,7724079,every simple decision to step forward is  crafting the impossible i had a call
0tIodVT4AfY,7724079,7730480,with someone today  very successful individual  right uh
0tIodVT4AfY,7730480,7738400,very um  skilled and respected in his field  brilliant platform great communicator
0tIodVT4AfY,7738400,7744000,just an all-around impressive human  being  he says yeah but i want to be one step
0tIodVT4AfY,7744000,7750560,further  i'm getting frustrated right i don't  know like what can i do to get there
0tIodVT4AfY,7750560,7756079,it's like i've been in that spot  in fact i find myself there
0tIodVT4AfY,7756079,7762800,a lot  and i think it's incredible that you're  looking out and asking what pivots can i  make what adjustments can i make
0tIodVT4AfY,7762800,7769360,but sometimes what you don't do is more  important than what you do  and what you shouldn't do is lose sight
0tIodVT4AfY,7769360,7778400,of how much you've built what you  shouldn't do is forget that one step at  a time creates miracles
0tIodVT4AfY,7779679,7784880,that you are well on your way to where  you want to be
0tIodVT4AfY,7785679,7791750,and yes ask that question ask how can i  evolve ask how can i level up
0tIodVT4AfY,7791750,7799520,[Music]  but never let impatience trump the big  picture never at the expense of who you
0tIodVT4AfY,7799520,7805360,are and what you've made  [Music]  because sometimes life is about just
0tIodVT4AfY,7805360,7810480,moving forward sometimes it's about the  trivial sometimes it's about the mundane
0tIodVT4AfY,7810480,7816079,that's what hurts  that's what gets you  most people don't quit because of a
0tIodVT4AfY,7816079,7822719,traumatic experience  most people don't quit because they took  a monumental l they quit because the
0tIodVT4AfY,7822719,7830560,little thing  doesn't reveal its  value it's very hard amidst the the
0tIodVT4AfY,7830560,7838079,chaos of day-to-day life  to remember what you're building to  remember each little step is a brick
0tIodVT4AfY,7838079,7843620,that will come to  evolve into the impossible
0tIodVT4AfY,7843620,7847319,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,7850079,7854440,dance before the music plays
0tIodVT4AfY,7856000,7862000,believe in the song  believe in the melody  believe in yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,7862000,7867040,because there will be a point where you  get there and there is a very abstract
0tIodVT4AfY,7867040,7873190,thing and it means many different things  to many different people but there will  be a point when you arrive
0tIodVT4AfY,7873190,7880000,[Music]  you'll exhale  look back on what you've done and be
0tIodVT4AfY,7880000,7885239,thankful  so wherever you are
0tIodVT4AfY,7885440,7891280,when you lose sight  [Music]  of your journey think about that moment
0tIodVT4AfY,7891280,7897760,think about how that will feel looking  back  on what you've made and all those times  you could have stopped and didn't
0tIodVT4AfY,7897760,7904320,all those times you wanted to say no but  you said yes they mean something
0tIodVT4AfY,7904320,7910719,i'm telling you they mean something  but that  is not half as important as the fact
0tIodVT4AfY,7910719,7918000,that you know  it means something you just need to  remind yourself of that fact
0tIodVT4AfY,7918000,7925638,so here's  to one step more  in building the impossible
0tIodVT4AfY,7940480,7948000,what if i told you  that you already know what must be done
0tIodVT4AfY,7948079,7954840,you just need to put yourself in  position  to do it
0tIodVT4AfY,7954880,7960239,you need to unlearn  the rules that crippled you
0tIodVT4AfY,7960239,7968239,the ideas that can find you  we are in constant pursuit
0tIodVT4AfY,7968239,7974800,of the thing that will magically right  all our wrongs  the answer that will give us something
0tIodVT4AfY,7974800,7981199,we've never had  know everything you need you have
0tIodVT4AfY,7981199,7988880,now  you just need to allow it  to flourish
0tIodVT4AfY,7988880,7997360,declutter  simplify  remove all that unnecessary stuff
0tIodVT4AfY,7997360,8004719,and walk your path  einstein once said everyone
0tIodVT4AfY,8004719,8011599,is a genius  but if you judge a fish by its ability  to climb a tree it will live its whole
0tIodVT4AfY,8011599,8019119,life believing that it is stupid  and what's great about this
0tIodVT4AfY,8019119,8024320,is the idea that who we are is not  found
0tIodVT4AfY,8024320,8031119,it's acknowledged it's accepted  and i think in our world
0tIodVT4AfY,8031119,8037040,there are so many fish as einstein says  trying to climb trees
0tIodVT4AfY,8037040,8043760,that it creates a sense of learned  helplessness  we are judging ourselves using the wrong
0tIodVT4AfY,8043760,8050000,metrics  equipped with the skills the  characteristics and and the abilities to
0tIodVT4AfY,8050000,8056610,win in our own arenas  but playing in someone else's
0tIodVT4AfY,8056610,8063599,[Music]  how loyal are you  to your own instincts
0tIodVT4AfY,8063599,8069920,do you do what you know is right  or what you feel obligated to pursue
0tIodVT4AfY,8069920,8075360,when was the last time you listened to  you
0tIodVT4AfY,8076560,8082719,in tim grover's relentless  he introduces a brilliant metaphor he
0tIodVT4AfY,8082719,8088079,says a lion doesn't have to be taught to  be a lion
0tIodVT4AfY,8088079,8096159,it just is  it hunts  runs roams explores
0tIodVT4AfY,8096159,8103440,lives life the only way it knows how  now if you capture a lion
0tIodVT4AfY,8103440,8109440,bring it to the zoo or put it in a cage  it will carry itself differently
0tIodVT4AfY,8109440,8118239,will lie down  move around lazily  sluggishly navigate its little space
0tIodVT4AfY,8118639,8123760,to passers-by they'd never know  what that lion
0tIodVT4AfY,8123760,8129030,really is  they never know what it looks like in  its element
0tIodVT4AfY,8129030,8134239,[Music]  but despite all this it is still in fact
0tIodVT4AfY,8134239,8140719,a lion it maintains that killer instinct
0tIodVT4AfY,8140719,8147840,his characteristics haven't disappeared  and if it were released from the cage
0tIodVT4AfY,8147840,8153119,it would go right back to doing what  lions do  being
0tIodVT4AfY,8153119,8159520,what lions are meant to be  it just has to ditch the cage
0tIodVT4AfY,8159520,8166880,and the point is perhaps  so do you  there's a little light
0tIodVT4AfY,8166880,8173360,in your soul that waits day and night  to explode into something
0tIodVT4AfY,8173360,8179920,meaningful  where your nature meets  your environment
0tIodVT4AfY,8179920,8186000,where the i shouldn't do this the odds  are impossible  the i'm not good enough
0tIodVT4AfY,8186000,8192160,i can't lose what i have now where all  that fades away where it's left behind
0tIodVT4AfY,8192160,8198960,you  and you're finally free to reign over  your own territory your own life your
0tIodVT4AfY,8198960,8206080,own empire  [Music]  see we constantly feel like our glasses
0tIodVT4AfY,8206080,8213760,are empty like we're missing pieces  in need of something just one more thing
0tIodVT4AfY,8213760,8221598,that will be our answer that's all we  need  and i can say with confidence
0tIodVT4AfY,8221598,8226800,it's not about what you need it's about  what you no longer need
0tIodVT4AfY,8226800,8233200,it's about mitigating the noise  so what matters can shine through
0tIodVT4AfY,8233200,8238800,removing those people in your life that  drag you down or add no value
0tIodVT4AfY,8238800,8245120,it's about getting rid of the things  that make your world unnecessarily  complex
0tIodVT4AfY,8245120,8250960,removing the need for immediate  validation success and accolades
0tIodVT4AfY,8250960,8258240,and instead embracing the little hinges  in your life that his w clement stone  said will ultimately swing the biggest
0tIodVT4AfY,8258240,8263678,doors  [Music]  we all
0tIodVT4AfY,8263678,8269920,have the lock the key and the map right  there amidst the trivialities of our
0tIodVT4AfY,8269920,8278080,day-to-day  and we walk right by them look right at  them we pick them up and put them down
0tIodVT4AfY,8278080,8283279,but have we learned to truly  see them
0tIodVT4AfY,8285598,8291040,everything starts with that awareness  my life did not change until i
0tIodVT4AfY,8291040,8299598,recognized that until i began asking  myself questions i'd never asked before  big picture questions obvious questions
0tIodVT4AfY,8299598,8306558,but just because it's obvious doesn't  mean it's always intuitive  right what do i want out of life
0tIodVT4AfY,8306558,8311840,what is important to me what's something  i love doing that i can dedicate myself  to
0tIodVT4AfY,8311840,8316960,that i can commit to being great at long  term that i'm so immersed in
0tIodVT4AfY,8316960,8323678,that when the inevitable down times  arrive the losses when the doubt and  insecurity creeps in
0tIodVT4AfY,8323678,8329280,i can keep moving forward because i'm so  in love with the process
0tIodVT4AfY,8329280,8336000,but i don't let the little things like  that define me  as jordan peterson famously puts it
0tIodVT4AfY,8336000,8342800,choose your sacrifice  a life of meaning
0tIodVT4AfY,8342800,8348319,isn't easy  but there's nothing more fulfilling
0tIodVT4AfY,8348319,8356399,because when you embark upon that  journey  it allows for the evolution of this self
0tIodVT4AfY,8356399,8364800,we can become something  more this nietzsche says those who have  a why to live can bear almost any how we
0tIodVT4AfY,8364800,8373359,equip ourselves for anything the  universe can throw at us we position  ourselves to evolve
0tIodVT4AfY,8373359,8379120,viktor frankl says man's main concern is  not to gain pleasure to avoid pain
0tIodVT4AfY,8379120,8383840,but rather to see meaning in his life
0tIodVT4AfY,8384880,8392479,to align yourself with and pursue that  which is your reason for living that's  how we transcend the day-to-day life
0tIodVT4AfY,8392479,8399760,we've come to know  when we breathe in possibility dance  with the infinite and of course
0tIodVT4AfY,8399760,8404960,something of this magnitude  it consists of ups and downs it's not
0tIodVT4AfY,8404960,8410960,the easy road  but it's the one worth taking
0tIodVT4AfY,8410960,8416960,our metaphorical lion doesn't succeed  every time he's prowling for food
0tIodVT4AfY,8416960,8422160,but he doesn't roll over and die  he doesn't recede or quit being a lion
0tIodVT4AfY,8422160,8429520,he gets up tomorrow and does it again  because it's who the lion is
0tIodVT4AfY,8429520,8435920,and while life doesn't unfold until you  find that same thing  for yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,8435920,8441120,and people say well i don't know that's  the problem i have no idea
0tIodVT4AfY,8441120,8447920,that's not the problem  that's the essence of life that's the  beauty you're here to explore and find
0tIodVT4AfY,8447920,8453359,that for yourself  but the power is knowing you're not  looking for something or someone to save
0tIodVT4AfY,8453359,8458640,you  you're looking for an environment in  which you can best be you
0tIodVT4AfY,8458640,8465520,you're looking for the right terrain to  share your gift with the world
0tIodVT4AfY,8465520,8472080,if you have what you need  then you're not looking for the product  you're looking for the delivery
0tIodVT4AfY,8472080,8478960,mechanism  the vehicle to nurture and transport  your value to a world that desperately
0tIodVT4AfY,8478960,8484840,needs it  you're looking to build yourself up and  in the process amaze
0tIodVT4AfY,8484840,8490880,yourself look what you're capable of is  beyond comprehension it's limitless
0tIodVT4AfY,8490880,8499280,almost unfathomable  but it is as ryan holiday says a  confidence that must be earned so start
0tIodVT4AfY,8499280,8504319,now earn it  let yourself succeed your intuition
0tIodVT4AfY,8504319,8510960,knows what feels right and what doesn't  but the seed must first be planted
0tIodVT4AfY,8510960,8516399,so make today about setting yourself up  for success turning off the idea that
0tIodVT4AfY,8516399,8524880,you're one piece away from completion  one minute away from starting that  you're almost ready no you are ready now
0tIodVT4AfY,8524880,8530640,you have what you need now you know  what's necessary now you just have to be
0tIodVT4AfY,8530640,8535760,your own ally  put yourself in position to be yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,8535760,8541040,let your values shine double down on  what matters to you look it's not a game
0tIodVT4AfY,8541040,8546720,of acquisition it's a game of courage do  you have the courage to be who you are
0tIodVT4AfY,8546720,8552800,to follow that potential that  possibility into the great
0tIodVT4AfY,8552800,8558229,unknown  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,8569560,8577280,[Music]  sometimes what we need most
0tIodVT4AfY,8577280,8582080,is not what we think  we need most
0tIodVT4AfY,8582960,8588479,it's not that break we've been waiting  for the universe to provide
0tIodVT4AfY,8588479,8595280,or the answer we've been desperately  seeking no sometimes we need only three
0tIodVT4AfY,8595280,8601600,words  don't  give
0tIodVT4AfY,8601600,8608800,up  don't turn back now
0tIodVT4AfY,8609439,8616399,and see i know you want to  [Music]  and that the meaningful thing the right
0tIodVT4AfY,8616399,8625600,thing requires we give all of ourselves  it metaphorically speaking is the most
0tIodVT4AfY,8625600,8630199,exhausting sometimes disheartening
0tIodVT4AfY,8632000,8639280,but this is your reminder that there  will come a point  when you look back on this moment and
0tIodVT4AfY,8639280,8644880,the best thing you'll have ever done  will have been continuing to put one
0tIodVT4AfY,8644880,8650960,foot in front of the other continuing  forward despite the circumstances
0tIodVT4AfY,8650960,8655840,towards that which means something to  you
0tIodVT4AfY,8657520,8663520,i remember in south florida  a handful of years ago i just moved down  here and
0tIodVT4AfY,8663520,8669120,i was exploring the area a little bit  looking for a place to live and i found  this
0tIodVT4AfY,8669120,8675359,kind of odd  little park in between a parking lot and  the beach
0tIodVT4AfY,8675359,8682399,and i pulled over just started walking  around  and ended up sitting down on this bench
0tIodVT4AfY,8682399,8689280,that faced the ocean  and just looked out for a while
0tIodVT4AfY,8689920,8695040,i remember looking at the people who all  seemed so happy they all seemed  fulfilled
0tIodVT4AfY,8695040,8702399,looked like they had it all together  [Music]  i looked at the ocean that was so much
0tIodVT4AfY,8702399,8708398,bigger  than me so vast so powerful
0tIodVT4AfY,8708800,8716800,at the non-stop  stream of planes flying overhead that  all seemed to have a direction a purpose
0tIodVT4AfY,8716800,8722880,they had their courses  mapped  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,8722880,8728399,and i think i remember it so vividly  because i'd never felt more alone than  at that moment
0tIodVT4AfY,8728399,8733920,like deeply painfully alone and it's not  that i enjoy bringing up these types of
0tIodVT4AfY,8733920,8739760,experiences  i bring them up because time has  revealed
0tIodVT4AfY,8739760,8745040,repeatedly that from these moments of  doubt and sometimes even despair come
0tIodVT4AfY,8745040,8752880,what we need most  so long  as we don't run from what the world
0tIodVT4AfY,8752880,8759200,is trying to provide us  it's as though we must experience
0tIodVT4AfY,8759200,8766479,emptiness  before we can become fulfilled  [Music]  we need to be overcome with this
0tIodVT4AfY,8766479,8772319,sensation that there's no way out  before realizing that there is always a
0tIodVT4AfY,8772319,8778960,way  so long as we're willing to find it  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,8778960,8784620,and the pain associated with that  willingness well it far outweighs the  alternative
0tIodVT4AfY,8784620,8791680,[Music]  i often break things down into this  dichotomy of the easy meaningless way
0tIodVT4AfY,8791680,8798800,versus the hard meaningful way  but that may be oversimplified like easy
0tIodVT4AfY,8798800,8804319,compared to what hard compared to what  it's easy to shut down when we're at our
0tIodVT4AfY,8804319,8811680,lowest  it's easy to stop when it hurts  but easy now evolves into what's
0tIodVT4AfY,8811680,8818000,actually incredibly difficult tomorrow a  difficult heart-wrenching regretful
0tIodVT4AfY,8818000,8824560,forever  admittedly a controversial figure but
0tIodVT4AfY,8824560,8830640,regardless one of the most important  quotes i've ever read  was by lance armstrong in his book it's
0tIodVT4AfY,8830640,8837040,not about the bike he says pain is  temporary  it may last a minute or an hour or a day
0tIodVT4AfY,8837040,8844160,or a year but eventually it will subside  and something else will take its place
0tIodVT4AfY,8844160,8849880,if i quit however it lasts  forever
0tIodVT4AfY,8850960,8856000,see the easy thing verse the hard thing  is too simplified void of imperative
0tIodVT4AfY,8856000,8861120,context the question is in our darkest  moments  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,8861120,8867600,will we stand up  when it hurts so that we can walk
0tIodVT4AfY,8867600,8875920,run and ultimately sprint towards what  matters  there's a realization that helped me
0tIodVT4AfY,8875920,8881600,because when we're in these situations  the thought goes like this things are  wrong things are broken my life isn't
0tIodVT4AfY,8881600,8887760,what it should be  i need to fix this and make it whole  make it right so i can live a good life
0tIodVT4AfY,8887760,8893439,like everyone else like there's a deep  loneliness associated with that
0tIodVT4AfY,8893439,8899840,misconception as though the world is put  together but i i am not  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,8899840,8906880,well let me dispel that notion and end  that narrative the world is a series of  objects that mean nothing
0tIodVT4AfY,8906880,8913439,other than the value we place upon them  seven billion people  all fighting their own battles all
0tIodVT4AfY,8913439,8920240,trying to make sense of things all  pretending like the little fairy tale  they've manufactured in their heads is
0tIodVT4AfY,8920240,8926560,the real thing or the right thing  when in actuality we are all just
0tIodVT4AfY,8926560,8931840,passengers along on a ride we do not  understand
0tIodVT4AfY,8931840,8939761,fighting  battles that we don't often comprehend  and cannot grasp
0tIodVT4AfY,8941439,8947840,you are not broken  you are human perfectly imperfect
0tIodVT4AfY,8947840,8953040,equipped with the tools to take another  step forward despite the chaos and the
0tIodVT4AfY,8953040,8959080,uncertainty  steps that become in the end  everything
0tIodVT4AfY,8959080,8964880,[Music]  i remember reading about jefferson how  he had migraines so severe while
0tIodVT4AfY,8964880,8971120,president  that he would do most of his important  work in the morning because of the high  probability
0tIodVT4AfY,8971120,8978399,he could literally be incapacitated from  noon on and i just thought man we are  all fighting battles
0tIodVT4AfY,8978399,8986479,we're all doing what we can to make the  most of our circumstance  to redirect discomfort into opportunity
0tIodVT4AfY,8986479,8993280,and pain into progress  and what's most incredible is that we  can
0tIodVT4AfY,8993280,8998960,there's a saying that it's not supposed  to be easy  the getting where you need to go
0tIodVT4AfY,8998960,9004720,requires the treacherous path associated  with a hero's journey
0tIodVT4AfY,9004720,9011920,the vast unknowns  the questions that remain unanswered for  extended periods of time the villains
0tIodVT4AfY,9011920,9018800,that seemingly inject themselves into  our lives  please understand that this is not a
0tIodVT4AfY,9018800,9027840,reflection of you who you are and your  capabilities this is the game of life
0tIodVT4AfY,9027840,9033200,this is today's difficulty in exchange  for tomorrow's meaning
0tIodVT4AfY,9033200,9040479,the pressure that creates the diamonds  and you don't have to be sure of  anything
0tIodVT4AfY,9040479,9047841,other than that you know  you will continue stepping forward
0tIodVT4AfY,9047920,9053920,because you can  things won't always go right
0tIodVT4AfY,9053920,9060640,but in the failures are the new tools to  grow and redirect  you won't always feel on top of the
0tIodVT4AfY,9060640,9066000,world but it's in the valleys of despair  that we're forced to truly analyze
0tIodVT4AfY,9066000,9072000,to think deeply  reapproach  and perhaps most importantly
0tIodVT4AfY,9072000,9077200,you may have days where you let yourself  down fall short perhaps lose sight of
0tIodVT4AfY,9077200,9083280,the courage to which you have attached  your dreams but that's okay
0tIodVT4AfY,9083280,9088800,you are defined not by your mistakes but  by the present moment
0tIodVT4AfY,9088800,9093920,not some impossible expectation of  perfection
0tIodVT4AfY,9093920,9101040,but by your ability to rise and rise  again  when it requires all of you to lift your
0tIodVT4AfY,9101040,9107840,head up and carry on  so go
0tIodVT4AfY,9107840,9113840,into that unknown  where fear is transformed into courage
0tIodVT4AfY,9113840,9120720,and doubt to strength  go  because if not here
0tIodVT4AfY,9120720,9126160,where and if not now  when  go
0tIodVT4AfY,9126160,9133120,all you need  you have  and when life finds you sitting down on
0tIodVT4AfY,9133120,9139280,a park bench staring out at a world that  feels too big and too complex
0tIodVT4AfY,9139280,9146319,that seems impossible to navigate  find it within yourself to smile
0tIodVT4AfY,9146319,9152160,smile because of what you've already  overcome  what you've been through who you are
0tIodVT4AfY,9152160,9158160,remember that you are exactly where you  need to be staring up at the meaning in
0tIodVT4AfY,9158160,9164160,life as opposed to down at your feet now  go
0tIodVT4AfY,9164160,9171760,no miracles here no mountains need be  jumped or oceans crossed but if you won
0tIodVT4AfY,9171760,9178240,step forward and two believe in yourself  to put the pieces together as they
0tIodVT4AfY,9178240,9184640,arrive there is nothing you can't do or  be there is no obstacle before you that
0tIodVT4AfY,9184640,9190560,is insurmountable  just  keep  going
0tIodVT4AfY,9190560,9196319,and sure sometimes that's all we can do  but it also happens to be true that it
0tIodVT4AfY,9196319,9203600,is your greatest superpower  to simply find a way to run if you can
0tIodVT4AfY,9203600,9208800,crawl if you must but find a way
0tIodVT4AfY,9208800,9215520,because deep down in your soul the  pieces are there
0tIodVT4AfY,9215520,9223200,and it will be  at some point  as you look back the greatest decision
0tIodVT4AfY,9223200,9229250,you've ever  made  [Music]  [Applause]
0tIodVT4AfY,9229250,9238749,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,9239480,9243400,[Applause]
0tIodVT4AfY,9250640,9257439,hold the vision  but trust the process  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,9257439,9262800,an idea that should act as our north  star  right as we make our way through life it
0tIodVT4AfY,9262800,9269600,proposes believing in a goal  [Music]  but at the same time understanding that
0tIodVT4AfY,9269600,9276399,its manifestation  will be unpredictable  challenging it may not unfold the way we
0tIodVT4AfY,9276399,9281680,thought it would  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,9281680,9288560,to me  though the most challenging aspect of  personal growth
0tIodVT4AfY,9288560,9294800,of building the things that matter  creating realities we dream of
0tIodVT4AfY,9295200,9300720,it's the mandatory dance we must do with  time
0tIodVT4AfY,9300720,9306960,the patience  that's woven into the equation it's the  empty spaces
0tIodVT4AfY,9306960,9312000,that we tend to use for manufacturing  doubt and disbelief when life has given
0tIodVT4AfY,9312000,9317920,us nothing to to react to it's like we  create monsters in our heads
0tIodVT4AfY,9317920,9323120,[Music]  and it's really an incredible thing
0tIodVT4AfY,9323120,9329680,when you think about it right i look  back on the past decade of my life in  the hardest parts and some were
0tIodVT4AfY,9329680,9334960,excruciating  they were pain derived from what i knew
0tIodVT4AfY,9334960,9341920,i hadn't yet accomplished  it was a feeling like  i wasn't moving fast enough like the
0tIodVT4AfY,9341920,9347120,winners in life had that over there and  all i had was this  over here
0tIodVT4AfY,9347120,9354160,completely nonsensical narrative but one  that certainly felt real  discomfort
0tIodVT4AfY,9354160,9360560,from the delta or the gap  between what i wanted and what i had a  feeling that would randomly dip in and
0tIodVT4AfY,9360560,9366479,out of my conscious mind  as i sort of  chipped away at my goals day in and day
0tIodVT4AfY,9366479,9373760,out and i started to wonder  how can i better position myself to grow
0tIodVT4AfY,9373760,9379680,to maintain that ambition but also  to do it with less anxiety right as i
0tIodVT4AfY,9379680,9384960,stated a few seconds ago hold that  vision  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,9384960,9392399,but perhaps improve my trust  and relationship with the process
0tIodVT4AfY,9392399,9399200,my ability to immerse myself in various  pursuits without dwelling on the fact  that i hadn't yet arrived because look i
0tIodVT4AfY,9399200,9404640,know this game we all know this game  there's always going to be another
0tIodVT4AfY,9404640,9410319,finish line to cross  that's a great thing but can also when
0tIodVT4AfY,9410319,9417520,we're not looking at it correctly be to  our detriment  there are always  higher numbers to achieve
0tIodVT4AfY,9417520,9423359,again incredible opportunity  but with the wrong perspective
0tIodVT4AfY,9423359,9430160,dangerous  if you can't find a way to appreciate  the now while you climb
0tIodVT4AfY,9430160,9435840,you will be forever lost there will  always be a hole that's never filled
0tIodVT4AfY,9436000,9443120,i think we need to be better about  supporting ourselves along this journey  no one can be there for me like i can
0tIodVT4AfY,9443120,9448399,and i think that's true for everyone we  need to be our greatest allies
0tIodVT4AfY,9448399,9454640,so i brought this question up as i tend  to do with a few of my friends right  with different perspectives they look at
0tIodVT4AfY,9454640,9461200,the world a little differently  and basically ask you know how can we  get out of our own ways or elaine to
0tIodVT4AfY,9461200,9469359,both be tenacious in our pursuit of  evolution to continue doing the things  that excite and challenge us
0tIodVT4AfY,9469359,9475120,while also being a little easier on  ourselves trusting that dance we do with  time
0tIodVT4AfY,9475120,9481280,as the process unfold  and so i present this question to one of  my friends sitting across from me at the
0tIodVT4AfY,9481280,9488640,table and he thinks about it he says hey  well that's what's got you where you are  that feeling like there's always more
0tIodVT4AfY,9488640,9494000,it's  the reason  for the success you've had and the  success you'll have in the future it's
0tIodVT4AfY,9494000,9499680,what will push you it's why you will  succeed  [Music]  people that
0tIodVT4AfY,9499680,9505600,accomplish things are never satisfied  jordan was never satisfied he was never  happy
0tIodVT4AfY,9505600,9511040,and in that context greatness and  happiness are not compatible
0tIodVT4AfY,9512399,9519120,and you know i took it in i certainly  appreciated the perspective right in  many ways i think he's right
0tIodVT4AfY,9519120,9526640,sort of reminded me of the idea behind  tim grover's book relentless that  it's an obsession that must take place
0tIodVT4AfY,9526640,9533760,it doesn't leave room for much else  right incredibly valuable to understand  if anything just to see just to grasp
0tIodVT4AfY,9533760,9538560,what it means to achieve in a world of  obstacles
0tIodVT4AfY,9539600,9544720,but truthfully i wasn't um  entirely satisfied
0tIodVT4AfY,9544720,9550720,right how can we better visualize the  process so that we're more powerful  allies to ourselves that's what i wanted
0tIodVT4AfY,9550720,9557840,to understand  and a short time later
0tIodVT4AfY,9557840,9564080,i'm at the kitchen table kind of going  over some analytics for  uh social media like youtube channel
0tIodVT4AfY,9564080,9570640,podcast stuff like that um  and my father who happened to fly in  from boston he's at the kitchen table
0tIodVT4AfY,9570640,9578800,with me we're having some coffee and i  made a comment  about the trajectory of the numbers
0tIodVT4AfY,9578800,9584640,you know i forget  that particular week maybe it was higher  or lower than expected i don't really  remember but
0tIodVT4AfY,9584640,9590000,um  he made this comment about  the patience that i've had with the
0tIodVT4AfY,9590000,9595520,channel over the years just an offhand  remark you know he said  the numbers are like the s p 500 right
0tIodVT4AfY,9595520,9601680,the stock market there are days when it  drops or days when it rises but over the  long haul it's steadily pointed up and
0tIodVT4AfY,9601680,9606760,it continues to point up
0tIodVT4AfY,9607760,9613520,and i found that so interesting  you know i harp on the small things a  lot on this channel the little
0tIodVT4AfY,9613520,9619439,breakthroughs that uh pave the way for  larger transformation  ideas that change the way we look at
0tIodVT4AfY,9619439,9625040,things  which ultimately change the way we act  which change the results we get and this
0tIodVT4AfY,9625040,9630560,happened to be one of them you know it  hit me  just  right
0tIodVT4AfY,9630560,9636399,what is perhaps the most important piece  in the famous book the intelligent
0tIodVT4AfY,9636399,9642640,investor what is the idea that made  buffett a billionaire
0tIodVT4AfY,9642640,9648000,it's that you invest in things you  believe in and you remove the emotion
0tIodVT4AfY,9648000,9653680,you hold the dips  right when the stock market takes a hit  and everyone's panicking and acting
0tIodVT4AfY,9653680,9659760,emotionally and selling  you don't sell  you buy more right when the world
0tIodVT4AfY,9659760,9666800,emotionally rushes out you rush in and  when the world emotionally rushes in you  step out
0tIodVT4AfY,9668160,9673840,well in life there will be days  when your metaphorical stock drops at
0tIodVT4AfY,9673840,9680080,least you feel like it does right those  youtube numbers perhaps numbers in the  old bank account maybe fitness goals
0tIodVT4AfY,9680080,9687120,fall flat maybe you're just not seeing a  return on investment  but we are never defined by the events
0tIodVT4AfY,9687120,9692560,of the day even the worst of days  they're merely a small part of a much
0tIodVT4AfY,9692560,9697760,larger pattern and the truth is  sometimes success is so small
0tIodVT4AfY,9697760,9702800,you can't see it  [Music]  of course you're going to be anxious if
0tIodVT4AfY,9702800,9708960,you think every day should be comprised  solely of mountain tops and finish lines  if you're always looking comparing
0tIodVT4AfY,9708960,9715439,contrasting  but sometimes success is point zero zero
0tIodVT4AfY,9715439,9721359,zero zero one percent better sometimes  success looks like the s p 500 taking a
0tIodVT4AfY,9721359,9726640,hit  dropping for a day a week or a month
0tIodVT4AfY,9726800,9733040,sometimes growth doesn't look like what  we want growth to look like
0tIodVT4AfY,9733040,9739760,but just like intelligent investors  you are putting your money in the belief  that at a certain point down the road
0tIodVT4AfY,9739760,9746560,the value will be higher than than it is  now  and this idea has been everything to me
0tIodVT4AfY,9746560,9752560,particularly on the days when it feels  like things are going backwards over  periods of time where i feel like i've
0tIodVT4AfY,9752560,9757680,been standing still where the voice in  my head  is presenting all kinds of scenarios
0tIodVT4AfY,9757680,9763358,that i could have been better or done  more and maybe so
0tIodVT4AfY,9763439,9772160,but these times are nothing more than  data points  they are steps along the way
0tIodVT4AfY,9772160,9777520,and knowing this it essentially frees me  from the delusion that growth is always
0tIodVT4AfY,9777520,9783840,visible that i can always look around in  and see visible triumph
0tIodVT4AfY,9783840,9789600,uh it allows me to march towards my  goals and my dreams  having a renewed relationship with each
0tIodVT4AfY,9789600,9794880,step  you know there's a saying that we need  to keep our head in the clouds and our
0tIodVT4AfY,9794880,9802960,feet on the ground life is a continual  juggling of extremes and i think  this gets it right
0tIodVT4AfY,9802960,9809200,our strength is in the ability to take  those steps  each one a message to the universe that
0tIodVT4AfY,9809200,9817200,we are stronger than we were yesterday  but what makes our journeys truly divine
0tIodVT4AfY,9817200,9825840,is that they aren't comprised of or  built with those steps like a house of  cards where one wrong move or or some
0tIodVT4AfY,9825840,9831760,delay will cause the whole thing to fall  to come crashing down no what makes the
0tIodVT4AfY,9831760,9838120,journey divine  is the infinite number of paths that can  bring about its
0tIodVT4AfY,9838120,9844479,materialization  there are no wrong paths some arrive  sooner some arrive later
0tIodVT4AfY,9844479,9850800,some  mid journey  causes to realize that the compass  wasn't even pointed in the right
0tIodVT4AfY,9850800,9856319,destination right they change what it  means to arrive but the point is
0tIodVT4AfY,9856319,9863600,every step is required every step is a  miracle but the power is not contained  solely in one step
0tIodVT4AfY,9863600,9870479,but rather what we choose to make of all  the steps combined the dips the lows and
0tIodVT4AfY,9870479,9875680,the losses only have significance if we  give them significance
0tIodVT4AfY,9875680,9880800,otherwise they're just a few stops along  the way to something
0tIodVT4AfY,9880800,9887760,beautiful  so why exhaust energy on data points  that haven't arrived yet on destinations
0tIodVT4AfY,9887760,9894160,in the future destinations that we trust  ourselves to figure out anyway
0tIodVT4AfY,9894160,9900560,our emphasis should be on the present  moment  on gratitude for the fact that we get to
0tIodVT4AfY,9900560,9907760,wake up and choose the pursuits that  we've chosen  and some days those pursuits will feel
0tIodVT4AfY,9907760,9914960,like the miracles that they are we'll  see the finish lines the mountaintops  will feel triumphant and some days
0tIodVT4AfY,9914960,9920399,those victories will be hidden in plain  view but they are there nonetheless
0tIodVT4AfY,9920399,9925760,as we make our way into the great  unknown that is life
0tIodVT4AfY,9925760,9931200,piecing each second each minute each  hour together
0tIodVT4AfY,9931200,9936880,to become the path  leading us where we need to be
0tIodVT4AfY,9936880,9945779,most  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,9957840,9964398,there has to come a time  when it's now  or never
0tIodVT4AfY,9965359,9971680,where you look at your reflection and  realize the cost of waiting  is far
0tIodVT4AfY,9971680,9978240,more expensive than the cost of stepping  out into the vast unknown
0tIodVT4AfY,9978720,9985479,in every journey that's when life  effectively  starts
0tIodVT4AfY,9985600,9991600,but here's why this is so tricky  what's caught me off guard so many times
0tIodVT4AfY,9991600,9998240,in my life it's the many shapes that  waiting takes
0tIodVT4AfY,9998240,10004000,see waiting is not always sitting there  and doing nothing not at all
0tIodVT4AfY,10004000,10010840,sometimes waiting is just the bare  minimum  it's moving forward so
0tIodVT4AfY,10010840,10016160,slightly and so slowly that you can  essentially trick yourself into thinking
0tIodVT4AfY,10016160,10022880,that you're progressing  into thinking you're making it happen
0tIodVT4AfY,10022960,10029040,when if you really stopped and looked  if you were honest with yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,10029040,10036479,if you really took a second to review to  analyze  you'd see that you're leaving almost
0tIodVT4AfY,10036479,10042240,everything on the table  you're not creating progress you're
0tIodVT4AfY,10042240,10048000,dancing with the idea  of progress
0tIodVT4AfY,10048880,10054080,sometimes waiting can mean just going  fast enough to not have to look at the
0tIodVT4AfY,10054080,10060960,fear you're hiding behind  that's reality right i think it's a very
0tIodVT4AfY,10060960,10067040,normal thing but i also think  life is too short for normalcy
0tIodVT4AfY,10067040,10073279,i think we can do better than normal  and i believe with all my heart and soul
0tIodVT4AfY,10073279,10078560,that the world has for us the  spectacular
0tIodVT4AfY,10078800,10084800,sitting there on the top shelf  waiting for those who can acquire the
0tIodVT4AfY,10084800,10091600,self belief and the awareness to reach  out and grab it  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10091600,10098240,and how crazy a thought  to realize that we could have been  sitting next to the very thing we've
0tIodVT4AfY,10098240,10103601,needed for days months  years
0tIodVT4AfY,10103760,10108960,but never taught ourselves to extend our  hands
0tIodVT4AfY,10108960,10111840,and reach
0tIodVT4AfY,10114399,10120240,when i look back the most important  moments in my life  were not
0tIodVT4AfY,10120240,10126560,tangible acquisition  and see the flashy things that try and  capture our attention right the money
0tIodVT4AfY,10126560,10132319,the condos even social media growth  business growth whatever it is you're  working towards those things are are
0tIodVT4AfY,10132319,10138399,wonderful they are benchmarks  that hopefully align with your north  star but they are not the difference
0tIodVT4AfY,10138399,10143840,makers  not at all right they were the byproduct  of what really mattered they weren't the
0tIodVT4AfY,10143840,10150840,moments  that moved the needle  my greatest moments were mental
0tIodVT4AfY,10150840,10157439,shifts cognitive transformations  that's why i do this for a living i see
0tIodVT4AfY,10157439,10162640,how much can change when we step back  and look at life just a little
0tIodVT4AfY,10162640,10168319,differently  it was uh my realizing that i was
0tIodVT4AfY,10168319,10174319,demanding too little of myself  that the world won't see greatness in me
0tIodVT4AfY,10174319,10180560,until i see it in me  that shift that pushed me to demand more
0tIodVT4AfY,10180560,10188240,of myself seek bigger challenges value  my work to a greater extent charge more  for my services
0tIodVT4AfY,10188479,10193760,and that mental shift is what made some  of those externalities possible
0tIodVT4AfY,10193760,10199279,it's realizing that if you want it more  is on the table that yesterday doesn't
0tIodVT4AfY,10199279,10205200,define you  that it's never too late to begin again  that everything you need you have right
0tIodVT4AfY,10205200,10212080,these are the ideas that truly change  lives  they make the difference
0tIodVT4AfY,10212080,10218640,and if we don't become aware of these  things  we leave them in the rearview
0tIodVT4AfY,10218640,10223680,we walk right by them  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10223680,10231120,in other words the most important  moments of my life  were when someone or something shook me
0tIodVT4AfY,10231120,10238160,and effectively said hey look around you  if this is what you want fine enjoy
0tIodVT4AfY,10238160,10245600,right but  for your information there is more out  there and if you step up just a little
0tIodVT4AfY,10245600,10252399,if you do just a little more  if you pivot and come at this thing a
0tIodVT4AfY,10252399,10258479,little bit differently  you will further that reach
0tIodVT4AfY,10258479,10264720,you'll create another ripple effect that  will transform your life but we must
0tIodVT4AfY,10264720,10269358,stop and look around
0tIodVT4AfY,10270479,10276399,a good friend of mine and this is just  the other day right we're having lunch  we're talking about marketing and uh you
0tIodVT4AfY,10276399,10282640,know we always joke that uh marketing is  just a part of the business that i don't  particularly enjoy right necessary but
0tIodVT4AfY,10282640,10288560,not my favorite then we're going through  kind of different strategies uh ideas
0tIodVT4AfY,10288560,10294160,and uh he presents one and i say  something like eh you know i don't need  to do that it seems a little over the
0tIodVT4AfY,10294160,10301680,top  and unfiltered he goes man you're  hurting your reach like what good is  that metaphorical restaurant that's not
0tIodVT4AfY,10301680,10308479,on anyone's radar  you're going to be the best pizza shop  that no one knows about
0tIodVT4AfY,10308479,10313920,and it just kind of hit me right it's  like man  i needed to see that differently maybe
0tIodVT4AfY,10313920,10319520,there's room to be a little more  aggressive  again one example of many
0tIodVT4AfY,10319520,10325040,and not every time is the idea or  opportunity the right one or necessary  one
0tIodVT4AfY,10325040,10331680,right but at least you stopped at least  you thought about it at least you  contrasted where you are with the
0tIodVT4AfY,10331680,10338319,potential upside of doing something  differently  that is where we leave opportunity on
0tIodVT4AfY,10338319,10345760,the table  you know we most often myself included
0tIodVT4AfY,10345760,10352319,paint regret as this uh the result of  this blatant walking away from something
0tIodVT4AfY,10352319,10358240,a deliberate declaration sort of a oh no  i'm not doing that no way
0tIodVT4AfY,10358240,10365359,and sure sometimes that's the case  sometimes we're cognizant of our fear  and decline to move forward but i wonder
0tIodVT4AfY,10365359,10372640,how often our neglect  or refusal is softer more subtle
0tIodVT4AfY,10372640,10379200,i wonder how much of our regret  comes from simply not stopping and  looking around
0tIodVT4AfY,10379200,10385680,not letting in alternative points of  view that challenge us  and force us to level up
0tIodVT4AfY,10385680,10391279,how much of our regret comes from simply  not understanding how short life is and
0tIodVT4AfY,10391279,10397279,how quickly time passes by  and if we don't create
0tIodVT4AfY,10397279,10404880,some abrupt change in our day-to-day  if we don't manufacture some momentum in
0tIodVT4AfY,10404880,10411040,our lives  even when it feels least ideal to do so  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10411040,10418760,you know the ship we needed to be on  will sail away without us
0tIodVT4AfY,10419600,10425760,so think back to your hardest days  even the ones that took you out that
0tIodVT4AfY,10425760,10431200,brought you to your knees  and realized that you survived every
0tIodVT4AfY,10431200,10437359,single one of them  you have four years been acquiring the
0tIodVT4AfY,10437359,10443040,armor  piece by piece  to move into something bigger
0tIodVT4AfY,10443040,10449600,[Music]  you've been learning you've been  evolving
0tIodVT4AfY,10450319,10455439,but today  what about sitting down with yourself
0tIodVT4AfY,10455439,10461279,and having the discussion you don't want  to have but need to have
0tIodVT4AfY,10461279,10469920,what about asking if it's time to leap  where you once stepped  to run where you once walked
0tIodVT4AfY,10469920,10475120,what about taking a good look around and  asking why you're living in ways that
0tIodVT4AfY,10475120,10482319,don't serve you  why you're conceding so much of what  matters
0tIodVT4AfY,10482319,10487680,again the evolution you want and need is  there it's always there and that's the
0tIodVT4AfY,10487680,10494000,key takeaway here  it will always exist
0tIodVT4AfY,10494000,10501359,but the question is  will your commitment to stop  to think and to reach for it
0tIodVT4AfY,10501359,10508720,be there  years from now  looking back i think we'll find
0tIodVT4AfY,10508720,10514720,that our willingness to ask those  questions mattered more than we could  have ever imagined
0tIodVT4AfY,10514720,10521439,that silence often implies the lack of  adversity needed to evolve
0tIodVT4AfY,10521439,10528080,because the reality you want it doesn't  come to you  you must go  to it
0tIodVT4AfY,10528080,10534080,and that means reapproaching today's  normalcy and comfort  seeing those things for what they are a
0tIodVT4AfY,10534080,10542319,continuation of the status quo  nothing changes until you change
0tIodVT4AfY,10542319,10550000,so take a look around examine those  pillars holding up your world view  not once but over and over again and if
0tIodVT4AfY,10550000,10555760,one  many or all of them must be knocked down  then so be it
0tIodVT4AfY,10555760,10561680,the point here is that you can build  the point here is that life happens on
0tIodVT4AfY,10561680,10566800,your terms whether you realize it or not  that doing nothing is accepting what
0tIodVT4AfY,10566800,10572030,things are it's a head nod and a thumbs  up to reality as is
0tIodVT4AfY,10572030,10578479,[Music]  so again ask yourself what you want out
0tIodVT4AfY,10578479,10583520,of life  and if you are missing that mark
0tIodVT4AfY,10583520,10590479,tear down what must be torn down  it might be hard now
0tIodVT4AfY,10590479,10597760,it might hurt now  it might be uncomfortable now but when  you're eventually standing upon an
0tIodVT4AfY,10597760,10603359,existence  that aligns with who you are and what  you want
0tIodVT4AfY,10603359,10612080,you'll see how necessary it all was  how it was there the whole time
0tIodVT4AfY,10612080,10619200,and thank god you found it within  yourself  to reach out
0tIodVT4AfY,10619200,10628720,and take it  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10628720,10638150,so  [Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10641200,10645679,[Music]
0tIodVT4AfY,10647600,10649680,you
