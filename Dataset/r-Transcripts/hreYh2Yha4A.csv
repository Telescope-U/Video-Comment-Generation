hreYh2Yha4A,10940,14009,work in a field where lives hang in the
hreYh2Yha4A,14009,18000,balance each day decisions are made that
hreYh2Yha4A,18000,22519,can spark or end a dream and
hreYh2Yha4A,22519,24800,minutes know
hreYh2Yha4A,24800,28039,seconds can change the trajectory of
hreYh2Yha4A,28039,33200,someone's life I am an educator I
hreYh2Yha4A,33200,36600,love working in the schools I love the
hreYh2Yha4A,36600,39390,promise and potential of the students I
hreYh2Yha4A,39390,42930,love the passion and professionalism of
hreYh2Yha4A,42930,45410,the teachers I
hreYh2Yha4A,45410,50039,even love the sight the sound and the
hreYh2Yha4A,50039,52800,smell of the buses as they roll in every
hreYh2Yha4A,52800,56239,morning and they leave every afternoon
hreYh2Yha4A,56239,59520,for over three dozen years I have
hreYh2Yha4A,59520,63870,dedicated my life's work to education 25
hreYh2Yha4A,63870,68460,of those years as a principal at every
hreYh2Yha4A,68460,72090,school level during that time I've
hreYh2Yha4A,72090,75799,observed a lot of change in education
hreYh2Yha4A,75799,78710,gone is the one-size-fits-all
hreYh2Yha4A,78710,81479,industrial model where we rolled out the
hreYh2Yha4A,81479,85220,same education for every child
hreYh2Yha4A,85220,88409,schools are using time more creatively
hreYh2Yha4A,88409,92130,the last school that I was at we started
hreYh2Yha4A,92130,95040,school at 9:25 because that was what was
hreYh2Yha4A,95040,97950,best for students and we gave our
hreYh2Yha4A,97950,99810,students an hour in the middle of the
hreYh2Yha4A,99810,106850,day to use to enhance their own learning
hreYh2Yha4A,106850,109740,differentiation meets the needs of
hreYh2Yha4A,109740,112290,students with a wide range of abilities
hreYh2Yha4A,112290,115100,and interests
hreYh2Yha4A,115100,117060,acceleration gives students the
hreYh2Yha4A,117060,120509,opportunity to graduate with a two-year
hreYh2Yha4A,120509,122149,college degree
hreYh2Yha4A,122149,126829,before they graduate from high school
hreYh2Yha4A,126829,129239,problem solving and creative thinking
hreYh2Yha4A,129239,131459,are replacing activities that can be
hreYh2Yha4A,131459,133890,answered by Google
hreYh2Yha4A,133890,137260,students in today's schools are creating
hreYh2Yha4A,137260,140280,their own future
hreYh2Yha4A,140280,143530,there's one thing that hasn't changed in
hreYh2Yha4A,143530,145560,our schools
hreYh2Yha4A,145560,148050,the children
hreYh2Yha4A,148050,151300,children still want to be loved they
hreYh2Yha4A,151300,154870,want to be good at something and they
hreYh2Yha4A,154870,157420,get excited when they succeed at a
hreYh2Yha4A,157420,158880,challenge
hreYh2Yha4A,158880,162690,what has changed is the world we live in
hreYh2Yha4A,162690,165640,can you imagine being without your cell
hreYh2Yha4A,165640,167760,phone or the internet
hreYh2Yha4A,167760,170290,children today are growing up in a world
hreYh2Yha4A,170290,172540,where they don't have to look up
hreYh2Yha4A,172540,177659,anything they can just ask Siri or Alexa
hreYh2Yha4A,178380,181720,we stand at the intersection of a great
hreYh2Yha4A,181720,184540,opportunity never before have there been
hreYh2Yha4A,184540,189280,so many choices in the education our
hreYh2Yha4A,189280,191460,children can have
hreYh2Yha4A,191460,193810,we have home schools charter schools
hreYh2Yha4A,193810,196840,virtual schools joining private and
hreYh2Yha4A,196840,200680,public schools each one offering
hreYh2Yha4A,200680,202320,something different
hreYh2Yha4A,202320,206380,but with choice comes the challenge of
hreYh2Yha4A,206380,210630,ensuring equity of opportunity for all
hreYh2Yha4A,210630,212430,students the
hreYh2Yha4A,212430,215620,quality of a child's education should
hreYh2Yha4A,215620,218830,not depend on the family that child was
hreYh2Yha4A,218830,220470,born into
hreYh2Yha4A,220470,222570,Eleanor Roosevelt said
hreYh2Yha4A,222570,228240,education is the cornerstone of Liberty
hreYh2Yha4A,228240,231040,it's our responsibility to ensure that
hreYh2Yha4A,231040,234400,all children especially the marginalized
hreYh2Yha4A,234400,235770,that
hreYh2Yha4A,235770,241180,often don't have a voice and can't speak
hreYh2Yha4A,241180,243610,for themselves can profit from the
hreYh2Yha4A,243610,246640,American dream that still stems from our
hreYh2Yha4A,246640,248370,education system
hreYh2Yha4A,248370,251230,when we think about education most of us
hreYh2Yha4A,251230,253630,think of our own personal education or
hreYh2Yha4A,253630,255570,maybe the experience of our children
hreYh2Yha4A,255570,258970,what is interesting in the work I do I
hreYh2Yha4A,258970,261310,travel throughout this country and I can
hreYh2Yha4A,261310,262830,tell you unequivocally
hreYh2Yha4A,262830,266289,that school today
hreYh2Yha4A,266289,269720,vary by the community they serve
hreYh2Yha4A,269720,272350,you see our schools are reflective of
hreYh2Yha4A,272350,276380,our communities and no two schools are
hreYh2Yha4A,276380,277660,alike
hreYh2Yha4A,277660,280370,it's fascinating to look at statistics
hreYh2Yha4A,280370,282620,on education the US Department of
hreYh2Yha4A,282620,285680,Education reports ninety percent of
hreYh2Yha4A,285680,287870,students here in the United States
hreYh2Yha4A,287870,291770,attend public schools with all the
hreYh2Yha4A,291770,294310,choices that we have
hreYh2Yha4A,294310,297830,education in public schools is still the
hreYh2Yha4A,297830,301000,mainstay for our students
hreYh2Yha4A,301000,303830,the Gallup Organization's does polls
hreYh2Yha4A,303830,306860,about just about anything every year
hreYh2Yha4A,306860,309530,they poll parents and they ask them how
hreYh2Yha4A,309530,311240,satisfied are you with the school that
hreYh2Yha4A,311240,314139,your child attends
hreYh2Yha4A,314139,316729,overwhelmingly parents report that they
hreYh2Yha4A,316729,319099,are satisfied with the school that their
hreYh2Yha4A,319099,323139,child attends as a matter of fact in
hreYh2Yha4A,323139,326539,2017 the satisfaction rate was higher
hreYh2Yha4A,326539,331150,than it's been since 2010 if
hreYh2Yha4A,331150,334430,clearly most of our children attend
hreYh2Yha4A,334430,337720,public schools and our parents are
hreYh2Yha4A,337720,340820,satisfied with the education their
hreYh2Yha4A,340820,343130,children are receiving why are there
hreYh2Yha4A,343130,345860,conversations that call to question the
hreYh2Yha4A,345860,349360,current status of public schools
hreYh2Yha4A,349360,351789,it's interesting to look back on
hreYh2Yha4A,351789,358880,education in the 1920s only 22% of young
hreYh2Yha4A,358880,359650,adults
hreYh2Yha4A,359650,363310,completed four years of high school
hreYh2Yha4A,363310,366830,but the world was different then there
hreYh2Yha4A,366830,368690,were options for adults who did not
hreYh2Yha4A,368690,370789,graduate from high school many young men
hreYh2Yha4A,370789,372490,joined the military
hreYh2Yha4A,372490,376250,factory jobs were abundant family farms
hreYh2Yha4A,376250,380320,required support and the role of women
hreYh2Yha4A,380320,383650,was quite different
hreYh2Yha4A,383650,387229,today graduation from high school cannot
hreYh2Yha4A,387229,390710,be an option it's the foundation of our
hreYh2Yha4A,390710,395060,children's future for years I've told my
hreYh2Yha4A,395060,397850,students that graduation is a
hreYh2Yha4A,397850,401970,destination it's the threshold to your
hreYh2Yha4A,401970,403430,future
hreYh2Yha4A,403430,406169,graduation is an opportunity to move
hreYh2Yha4A,406169,409470,into adulthood equipped with the tools
hreYh2Yha4A,409470,412889,to continue your education or enter a
hreYh2Yha4A,412889,415560,career that will promise a successful
hreYh2Yha4A,415560,416840,life in
hreYh2Yha4A,416840,419880,order for our economy to be strong and
hreYh2Yha4A,419880,424050,our democracy secure we must ensure that
hreYh2Yha4A,424050,428699,we educate all our students so they can
hreYh2Yha4A,428699,431190,graduate and are able to positively
hreYh2Yha4A,431190,434660,contribute to our communities our
hreYh2Yha4A,434660,438030,schools are change agents for our
hreYh2Yha4A,438030,442100,country Abraham Lincoln said the
hreYh2Yha4A,442100,445500,the philosophy of the school room in one
hreYh2Yha4A,445500,448500,generation will be the philosophy of
hreYh2Yha4A,448500,452060,government in the next
hreYh2Yha4A,452060,455430,we must acknowledge the significance of
hreYh2Yha4A,455430,458610,the impact of our schools not just for
hreYh2Yha4A,458610,461210,today but for this and future
hreYh2Yha4A,461210,463610,generations
hreYh2Yha4A,463610,466349,to ensure the continued success of our
hreYh2Yha4A,466349,468860,schools we need to take a look at
hreYh2Yha4A,468860,471889,current conversations about education
hreYh2Yha4A,471889,475949,involving the supply of teachers funding
hreYh2Yha4A,475949,478860,for public education and the current
hreYh2Yha4A,478860,481830,policy discussions supporting school
hreYh2Yha4A,481830,483409,vouchers
hreYh2Yha4A,483409,489000,first we must have the best and the
hreYh2Yha4A,489000,491970,brightest people in our classrooms
hreYh2Yha4A,491970,494490,teaching our children as we forge
hreYh2Yha4A,494490,498740,forward with initiatives to fill jobs in
hreYh2Yha4A,498740,501780,careers like science technology
hreYh2Yha4A,501780,504539,engineering and math and all of the
hreYh2Yha4A,504539,509330,other areas we need to remember first
hreYh2Yha4A,509330,512909,to promote the profession that makes all
hreYh2Yha4A,512909,516690,other professions possible we need to
hreYh2Yha4A,516690,518520,encourage young people to enter the
hreYh2Yha4A,518520,521330,field of education without
hreYh2Yha4A,521330,524940,outstanding teachers the future of all
hreYh2Yha4A,524940,528200,other careers dims
hreYh2Yha4A,528200,531490,before I was an educator I had a very
hreYh2Yha4A,531490,533279,cessful career in law enforcement
hreYh2Yha4A,533279,536730,but someone reached out to me and said
hreYh2Yha4A,536730,538930,why don't you think about being a
hreYh2Yha4A,538930,541930,teacher I had not thought about being a
hreYh2Yha4A,541930,543940,teacher I had never thought about being
hreYh2Yha4A,543940,544770,a teacher
hreYh2Yha4A,544770,547709,but that one person reached out and
hreYh2Yha4A,547709,551310,planted that seed
hreYh2Yha4A,551310,555399,we need to be planting that seed not
hreYh2Yha4A,555399,557410,just in young people but in people that
hreYh2Yha4A,557410,559450,might be transitioning from one career
hreYh2Yha4A,559450,562089,to the next throughout this country
hreYh2Yha4A,562089,564130,there are hundreds of teacher vacancies
hreYh2Yha4A,564130,567730,that go unfilled each year due to a lack
hreYh2Yha4A,567730,570570,of applicants
hreYh2Yha4A,570570,573490,we need to change the conversation to
hreYh2Yha4A,573490,576820,invite and encourage people to become
hreYh2Yha4A,576820,579820,educators and create a positive momentum
hreYh2Yha4A,579820,583470,toward careers in education
hreYh2Yha4A,583470,586420,the second conversation we need to
hreYh2Yha4A,586420,591089,examine is support for public schools
hreYh2Yha4A,591089,594040,when those tax bills start rolling out
hreYh2Yha4A,594040,596649,the conversations start and you hear
hreYh2Yha4A,596649,598870,people saying well I don't have children
hreYh2Yha4A,598870,601180,in school I don't know why I should pay
hreYh2Yha4A,601180,604620,to support public schools
hreYh2Yha4A,604620,607060,when those conversations starts I
hreYh2Yha4A,607060,608560,immediately start thinking about our
hreYh2Yha4A,608560,610529,public roads
hreYh2Yha4A,610529,614170,there are roads in our community in our
hreYh2Yha4A,614170,617140,state well in our country that I will
hreYh2Yha4A,617140,620910,never drive on yet I
hreYh2Yha4A,620910,625300,realize the importance of promoting and
hreYh2Yha4A,625300,626610,supporting
hreYh2Yha4A,626610,631089,public roads in our country you see much
hreYh2Yha4A,631089,633459,like the quality of our roads improves
hreYh2Yha4A,633459,635380,the quality and safety of our
hreYh2Yha4A,635380,638920,communities the qualities of our public
hreYh2Yha4A,638920,639540,schools
hreYh2Yha4A,639540,643089,impact our communities in ways we may
hreYh2Yha4A,643089,645190,not recognize
hreYh2Yha4A,645190,646529,[Applause]
hreYh2Yha4A,646529,649259,go ahead yes
hreYh2Yha4A,649259,652259,absolutely
hreYh2Yha4A,653340,656970,in one day I experience the impact of
hreYh2Yha4A,656970,658920,our public school students and graduates
hreYh2Yha4A,658920,660779,when I was helped in the grocery store
hreYh2Yha4A,660779,664140,when I had the air in my car tire
hreYh2Yha4A,664140,667830,checked when I got a flu shot when I saw
hreYh2Yha4A,667830,670500,EMS driving down the road to respond to
hreYh2Yha4A,670500,673560,an emergency and when I was helped at a
hreYh2Yha4A,673560,675930,restaurant later on that evening
hreYh2Yha4A,675930,679050,you see I benefited from knowing that
hreYh2Yha4A,679050,681900,these students had been students in my
hreYh2Yha4A,681900,685470,school but I want you to think about the
hreYh2Yha4A,685470,687900,students and graduates of our public
hreYh2Yha4A,687900,692210,schools that impact your day the doctor
hreYh2Yha4A,692210,696510,the mechanic the cashiers the engineers
hreYh2Yha4A,696510,698790,the police officer the nurses the
hreYh2Yha4A,698790,700350,bankers the real estate agent the
hreYh2Yha4A,700350,704760,post-office workers the accountants the
hreYh2Yha4A,704760,708630,list is as personal as each person in
hreYh2Yha4A,708630,711960,this room the quality of our public
hreYh2Yha4A,711960,715140,schools influences the quality of our
hreYh2Yha4A,715140,719430,days every day we need to support public
hreYh2Yha4A,719430,721710,education funding not just for the
hreYh2Yha4A,721710,724830,children that are in school today but
hreYh2Yha4A,724830,727620,for the quality of life they provide to
hreYh2Yha4A,727620,731070,everyone in our communities we need to
hreYh2Yha4A,731070,733650,change the conversation to support
hreYh2Yha4A,733650,736320,public education funding and celebrate
hreYh2Yha4A,736320,739589,education for the positive impact it has
hreYh2Yha4A,739589,742730,on our communities
hreYh2Yha4A,742730,746700,the third conversation that we need to
hreYh2Yha4A,746700,749520,explore is a hot topic in education
hreYh2Yha4A,749520,753380,policy now school vouchers
hreYh2Yha4A,753380,756270,as I think about the essence of
hreYh2Yha4A,756270,759150,education and our country's foundational
hreYh2Yha4A,759150,761880,belief in a strong public school system
hreYh2Yha4A,761880,764730,I'm concerned about policies involving
hreYh2Yha4A,764730,766880,school vouchers
hreYh2Yha4A,766880,770550,school vouchers indirectly take away
hreYh2Yha4A,770550,773910,from the support of public schools by
hreYh2Yha4A,773910,777480,allowing potential tax dollars to be
hreYh2Yha4A,777480,781100,shifted to private schools with
hreYh2Yha4A,781100,784910,absolutely no accountability
hreYh2Yha4A,784910,788250,the way most vouchers work is a
hreYh2Yha4A,788250,791330,corporation makes a contribution to a
hreYh2Yha4A,791330,795470,private entity in return that
hreYh2Yha4A,795470,800030,corporation receives a tax credit and
hreYh2Yha4A,800030,804390,then students the most impoverished
hreYh2Yha4A,804390,807060,students in underperforming schools are
hreYh2Yha4A,807060,809520,given an opportunity to apply for those
hreYh2Yha4A,809520,810770,vouchers
hreYh2Yha4A,810770,813620,it sounds like a good thing
hreYh2Yha4A,813620,817010,however if we believe all children
hreYh2Yha4A,817010,820190,need to receive a quality education
hreYh2Yha4A,820190,822620,think about this
hreYh2Yha4A,822620,825360,what happens to those students who
hreYh2Yha4A,825360,828800,remain in the school
hreYh2Yha4A,828800,832620,that is impoverished and the community
hreYh2Yha4A,832620,837060,now has a smaller tax base to support
hreYh2Yha4A,837060,838700,that school
hreYh2Yha4A,838700,841020,vouchers do nothing to support or
hreYh2Yha4A,841020,844290,improve underperforming schools most of
hreYh2Yha4A,844290,846780,our underperforming schools are a result
hreYh2Yha4A,846780,850080,of the struggle to find certified
hreYh2Yha4A,850080,851720,teachers and
hreYh2Yha4A,851720,857510,the weak support of public schools
hreYh2Yha4A,857510,861150,how can we offer the opportunity for to
hreYh2Yha4A,861150,863010,apply for vouchers to students in
hreYh2Yha4A,863010,864720,underperforming school and expect the
hreYh2Yha4A,864720,867950,quality of those schools to increase
hreYh2Yha4A,867950,870680,for the students who remain
hreYh2Yha4A,870680,873750,we need to change the policy
hreYh2Yha4A,873750,876720,conversations surrounding public school
hreYh2Yha4A,876720,879140,vouchers
hreYh2Yha4A,879140,881990,education is a public trust
hreYh2Yha4A,881990,884760,when I'm in schools working with
hreYh2Yha4A,884760,887840,students I'm convinced our
hreYh2Yha4A,887840,891960,future is secure the students in our
hreYh2Yha4A,891960,894540,schools today will be the ones who
hreYh2Yha4A,894540,896790,address the problems that exists as a
hreYh2Yha4A,896790,898680,result of our generation and the
hreYh2Yha4A,898680,901310,generations before us
hreYh2Yha4A,901310,904530,they will create opportunities and
hreYh2Yha4A,904530,907580,impact the world in ways we can only
hreYh2Yha4A,907580,909980,imagine the
hreYh2Yha4A,909980,913970,most precious resource in our country is
hreYh2Yha4A,913970,916300,our children
hreYh2Yha4A,916300,919810,if we want to protect and promote
hreYh2Yha4A,919810,924880,democracy enhance and secure our economy
hreYh2Yha4A,924880,929620,we must invest in and ensure our public
hreYh2Yha4A,929620,931990,schools have the resources they need to
hreYh2Yha4A,931990,936340,make every public school a school of
hreYh2Yha4A,936340,939820,choice a school that you want your
hreYh2Yha4A,939820,941880,children to go to
hreYh2Yha4A,941880,944590,I've dedicated my life's work to
hreYh2Yha4A,944590,947470,education because I believe in the
hreYh2Yha4A,947470,952660,greatness of each child we must change
hreYh2Yha4A,952660,954310,the conversations about public education
hreYh2Yha4A,954310,956830,to ensure our schools have the teachers
hreYh2Yha4A,956830,960550,the funding and the policies in place to
hreYh2Yha4A,960550,962320,meet the needs of our communities our
hreYh2Yha4A,962320,965580,state's and our nation
hreYh2Yha4A,965580,969580,Nelson Mandela said education is the
hreYh2Yha4A,969580,972550,most powerful weapon which you can use
hreYh2Yha4A,972550,975480,to change the world
hreYh2Yha4A,975480,979030,what are we doing to ensure our
hreYh2Yha4A,979030,982090,children's education prepares them to be
hreYh2Yha4A,982090,985950,the change we are counting on
hreYh2Yha4A,985950,990280,let's take a risk let's step out of our
hreYh2Yha4A,990280,993610,comfort zone and start changing some of
hreYh2Yha4A,993610,995160,these conversations
