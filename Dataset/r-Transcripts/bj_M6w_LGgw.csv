bj_M6w_LGgw,39520,40640,don't know if that's a good or a bad
bj_M6w_LGgw,40640,42000,thing and it leaves a bit of a weird

bj_M6w_LGgw,58160,59840,first of all i mean look at this thing
bj_M6w_LGgw,59840,61920,that is basically a full meal by itself
bj_M6w_LGgw,61920,63520,but i'm only taking little bites of
bj_M6w_LGgw,63520,64878,everything today because of how much
bj_M6w_LGgw,64878,68640,food we have to take time for a bite
bj_M6w_LGgw,68799,70240,i physically cannot get my teeth through
bj_M6w_LGgw,70240,71360,this thing man you want to take a crack
bj_M6w_LGgw,71360,74080,at it okay okay

bj_M6w_LGgw,80720,83439,i couldn't eat it
bj_M6w_LGgw,84159,85840,behind me is a corn corndog stand i
bj_M6w_LGgw,85840,87200,don't think they have the pickled corn
bj_M6w_LGgw,87200,88400,dogs which is what i actually want to
bj_M6w_LGgw,88400,89920,taste today let's get a regular one to
bj_M6w_LGgw,89920,91360,start out here we've got our corn dog
bj_M6w_LGgw,91360,92799,which i will say manny looks quite
bj_M6w_LGgw,92799,94400,overcooked to me that's burn hey madam
bj_M6w_LGgw,94400,96320,come here why are you burning veg burnt
bj_M6w_LGgw,96320,98159,to a frisk what are they doing that's
bj_M6w_LGgw,98159,99759,where juicy corn though that is good
bj_M6w_LGgw,99759,101200,despite the fact that it's maybe a bit
bj_M6w_LGgw,101200,102720,overcooked you can't really taste the
bj_M6w_LGgw,102720,104000,fact that that's happened there is a
bj_M6w_LGgw,104000,105520,little bit too much baking soda in here
bj_M6w_LGgw,105520,107200,my mouth is tingling a bit perhaps the
bj_M6w_LGgw,107200,109119,most famous food in all of disneyland is
bj_M6w_LGgw,109119,110640,the dole where apparently it's some sort
bj_M6w_LGgw,110640,112479,of pineapple flavored ice cream i really
bj_M6w_LGgw,112479,114000,don't know but given how much hype there
bj_M6w_LGgw,114000,115680,is around it i'm going in with a high
bj_M6w_LGgw,115680,117439,expectation you're nick
bj_M6w_LGgw,117439,119119,i met a fellow nick here you're guarding
bj_M6w_LGgw,119119,120560,the dole whip station here huh the
bj_M6w_LGgw,120560,121840,duluth station's right here it's the
bj_M6w_LGgw,121840,123759,most popular footage disneyland oh yeah
bj_M6w_LGgw,123759,125439,we got the dole whip time to see if it
bj_M6w_LGgw,125439,128800,lives up to the hype
bj_M6w_LGgw,128800,130080,it's pretty good i thought it was gonna
bj_M6w_LGgw,130080,132239,be really artificial pineapple flavor
bj_M6w_LGgw,132239,133440,and it's actually not it's like the
bj_M6w_LGgw,133440,134959,perfect blend of cream and fresh
bj_M6w_LGgw,134959,136560,pineapple i don't yet know if it's gonna
bj_M6w_LGgw,136560,138080,be the best thing we have today but for
bj_M6w_LGgw,138080,139760,right now it's number one and it's easy
bj_M6w_LGgw,139760,141440,eight out of ten interestingly enough so
bj_M6w_LGgw,141440,143200,far a lot of the food here looks really
bj_M6w_LGgw,143200,144720,creative especially some of the stuff we
bj_M6w_LGgw,144720,146239,passed but there's also really really
bj_M6w_LGgw,146239,147920,long lines so it's gonna take us a while
bj_M6w_LGgw,147920,149520,to get all this food at this place here
bj_M6w_LGgw,149520,151120,the jolly holiday they have iberia
bj_M6w_LGgw,151120,153200,grilled cheese which i am very excited
bj_M6w_LGgw,153200,156840,for this looks fantastic
bj_M6w_LGgw,157760,159599,crispy toasted bread tons and tons of
bj_M6w_LGgw,159599,161200,cheese and meat and not one but two
bj_M6w_LGgw,161200,162640,really great sauces that comes with it
bj_M6w_LGgw,162640,164720,my top score of the day nine and a half
bj_M6w_LGgw,164720,166239,out of ten media grilled cheese
bj_M6w_LGgw,166239,168000,fantastic we have now just passed the
bj_M6w_LGgw,168000,169840,places serving blueberry fritters i
bj_M6w_LGgw,169840,171200,don't think these are very famous but
bj_M6w_LGgw,171200,173200,i'm going to try them anyway oh man
bj_M6w_LGgw,173200,174480,that's so good kind of tastes like a
bj_M6w_LGgw,174480,176080,fried blueberry muffin but it's only a
bj_M6w_LGgw,176080,177599,flat 5 out of 10 for me because there's
bj_M6w_LGgw,177599,178910,way too much oil
bj_M6w_LGgw,178910,181680,[Music]
bj_M6w_LGgw,181680,183120,we are at this barbecue spot now
bj_M6w_LGgw,183120,185040,apparently they have fantastic skewers
bj_M6w_LGgw,185040,186159,we already ordered we're just waiting
bj_M6w_LGgw,186159,187519,for them to grill a couple of most
bj_M6w_LGgw,187519,188800,important thing is whether or not this
bj_M6w_LGgw,188800,190319,beef is tender
bj_M6w_LGgw,190319,192000,oh my it's a little peppery but that
bj_M6w_LGgw,192000,193440,piece of beef is more tender than some
bj_M6w_LGgw,193440,195360,of the wagyu manion i make and we make a
bj_M6w_LGgw,195360,197200,lot of wacky this here is the burger of
bj_M6w_LGgw,197200,199920,most people's dreams oh my god
bj_M6w_LGgw,199920,202879,manny's favorite we got a big nice piece
bj_M6w_LGgw,202879,205280,of this is uh i don't know this is
bj_M6w_LGgw,205280,206799,college to know this not gonna lie we're
bj_M6w_LGgw,206799,208239,starting to get a little bit confused
bj_M6w_LGgw,208239,210080,about what exactly we're cutting up here
bj_M6w_LGgw,210080,211920,but we're just doing our best as for the
bj_M6w_LGgw,211920,214000,chicken it's very dry the beef might be
bj_M6w_LGgw,214000,215519,an eight out of ten but the chicken the
bj_M6w_LGgw,215519,217200,flat three there's also this refreshing
bj_M6w_LGgw,217200,219840,looking slushie called the jungle julep
bj_M6w_LGgw,219840,221519,wait that's really good this tastes like
bj_M6w_LGgw,221519,223680,a slushy version of a starburst or maybe
bj_M6w_LGgw,223680,225360,skittle it's super refreshing but maybe
bj_M6w_LGgw,225360,227440,a little too sweet for me 7.8 out of 10.
bj_M6w_LGgw,227440,231400,time to ride some race cars
bj_M6w_LGgw,233640,239270,[Music]
bj_M6w_LGgw,243840,245280,we're at a restaurant now called min
bj_M6w_LGgw,245280,247360,julep and they have these mickey mouse
bj_M6w_LGgw,247360,249040,shaped beignets i think we're in the new
bj_M6w_LGgw,249040,250400,orleans section right now so that would
bj_M6w_LGgw,250400,251439,make a lot of sense why they have
bj_M6w_LGgw,251439,252840,beignets
bj_M6w_LGgw,252840,255920,here think it's banana flavored good for
bj_M6w_LGgw,255920,257759,creativity there's a plus one powdered
bj_M6w_LGgw,257759,259600,sugar all over me minus one six out of
bj_M6w_LGgw,259600,260880,ten take a little sip of the mickey
bj_M6w_LGgw,260880,262479,mouse sauce is that really what it's
bj_M6w_LGgw,262479,264080,called mini no no
bj_M6w_LGgw,264080,268000,did you get the dipping sauce
bj_M6w_LGgw,268000,269440,picked up some more french food and this
bj_M6w_LGgw,269440,270800,right here is the shrimp po boy this
bj_M6w_LGgw,270800,272160,should not be called a po boy this
bj_M6w_LGgw,272160,273600,should be called an oh boy what it
bj_M6w_LGgw,273600,276560,should be is not on the menu
bj_M6w_LGgw,276560,278000,based on the smell and the look of this
bj_M6w_LGgw,278000,280000,thing i'm gonna give it a 0.5 out of 10.
bj_M6w_LGgw,280000,281440,from the same restaurant though we have
bj_M6w_LGgw,281440,283120,what's called the pirate parfait it's
bj_M6w_LGgw,283120,284560,actually quite pretty and hopefully they
bj_M6w_LGgw,284560,287840,can redeem themselves with this one
bj_M6w_LGgw,287919,289520,i think i would like this if i was six
bj_M6w_LGgw,289520,290800,years old but it does rank better than
bj_M6w_LGgw,290800,292000,their po boys i'll give it a three out
bj_M6w_LGgw,292000,293440,of ten and move on to the next food
bj_M6w_LGgw,293440,295520,mickey mouse cotton candy sometimes i do
bj_M6w_LGgw,295520,296800,have a little bit of a sweet tooth and
bj_M6w_LGgw,296800,298800,there is nothing like a good big ball of
bj_M6w_LGgw,298800,301520,cotton candy three two one
bj_M6w_LGgw,301520,302720,they're very good that's good it's all
bj_M6w_LGgw,302720,304160,eight out of ten he has been inside the
bj_M6w_LGgw,304160,305600,bag all day sitting in that sun over
bj_M6w_LGgw,305600,306720,there i mean it's a little bit too
bj_M6w_LGgw,306720,308240,compact i like it to be lighter and
bj_M6w_LGgw,308240,310000,fluffier cotton candy is so simple and
bj_M6w_LGgw,310000,311120,easy to make it needs to have a high
bj_M6w_LGgw,311120,312320,standard i'm gonna give it a five and a
bj_M6w_LGgw,312320,313680,half out of ten first thing i notice
bj_M6w_LGgw,313680,315120,about this strawberry lemonade funnel
bj_M6w_LGgw,315120,316400,cake is that it's in the shape of a
bj_M6w_LGgw,316400,318160,mickey mouse on top
bj_M6w_LGgw,318160,319840,my question for this is will it taste
bj_M6w_LGgw,319840,323440,like strawberry lemonade let's find out
bj_M6w_LGgw,323680,325680,their oil temperature is way too low
bj_M6w_LGgw,325680,327120,first of all what's on top is not
bj_M6w_LGgw,327120,330160,whipped cream it's cool mickey's cream
bj_M6w_LGgw,330160,331919,and like i said oil temperature is way
bj_M6w_LGgw,331919,333680,too low so the oil is soaking into the
bj_M6w_LGgw,333680,334960,funnel cake instead of frying the
bj_M6w_LGgw,334960,336479,outside to a crispy edge and keeping
bj_M6w_LGgw,336479,338080,inside light and fluffy which would be
bj_M6w_LGgw,338080,339360,the goal with the funnel cake with all
bj_M6w_LGgw,339360,340880,of that said i'm giving this a one and a
bj_M6w_LGgw,340880,342880,half out of ten surprises trying to put
bj_M6w_LGgw,342880,344639,them out of business we are finally
bj_M6w_LGgw,344639,346560,tasting the big giant turkey leg this
bj_M6w_LGgw,346560,348479,thing is already dripping so it must be
bj_M6w_LGgw,348479,350240,good but also probably quite messy i
bj_M6w_LGgw,350240,351600,also think this thing probably weighs at
bj_M6w_LGgw,351600,353680,least over a pound it's almost the size
bj_M6w_LGgw,353680,354880,of my head
bj_M6w_LGgw,354880,356560,and of all the things today the smell
bj_M6w_LGgw,356560,358400,coming off this turkey leg right here is
bj_M6w_LGgw,358400,360080,insane
bj_M6w_LGgw,360080,362080,oh my god obviously the big time of the
bj_M6w_LGgw,362080,363520,year to have turkey is thanksgiving but
bj_M6w_LGgw,363520,365120,i feel like the turkey's always dry and
bj_M6w_LGgw,365120,366560,just not that exciting and this thing
bj_M6w_LGgw,366560,368720,right here is fall off the bone turkey
bj_M6w_LGgw,368720,370000,meat the one thing i don't entirely
bj_M6w_LGgw,370000,371520,understand why would you give someone a
bj_M6w_LGgw,371520,373280,one two pound turkey leg before you put
bj_M6w_LGgw,373280,374720,them on a roller coaster seems kind of
bj_M6w_LGgw,374720,376080,funny
bj_M6w_LGgw,376080,377280,i don't know how they make these turkey
bj_M6w_LGgw,377280,378880,legs but this right here is a 10 out of
bj_M6w_LGgw,378880,382720,10. what is this music what is going on
bj_M6w_LGgw,383190,386319,[Music]
bj_M6w_LGgw,386319,388000,this has to be one of the weirdest
bj_M6w_LGgw,388000,389759,restaurants i have ever been inside we
bj_M6w_LGgw,389759,391520,got a few mozzarella sticks let's test
bj_M6w_LGgw,391520,394800,if they have a nice cheese ball
bj_M6w_LGgw,396160,397600,they also have this summer strawberry
bj_M6w_LGgw,397600,399280,float which is basically just a sprite
bj_M6w_LGgw,399280,400960,with a bunch of strawberry ice cream on
bj_M6w_LGgw,400960,402319,top i had to come outside because it was
bj_M6w_LGgw,402319,403600,way too loud in there but the first
bj_M6w_LGgw,403600,405120,problem here is that i can't even pull
bj_M6w_LGgw,405120,407840,the spoon out of it i got it i got it it
bj_M6w_LGgw,407840,409199,basically just tastes like a mixture of
bj_M6w_LGgw,409199,410639,strawberries and cream if you shake it
bj_M6w_LGgw,410639,412000,up a little bit it gets really creamy
bj_M6w_LGgw,412000,413360,and foamy somehow this has turned into
bj_M6w_LGgw,413360,414720,one of the better bites of the day i'm
bj_M6w_LGgw,414720,416160,gonna give it an eight out of ten as i'm
bj_M6w_LGgw,416160,417599,sure you know by now we've eaten lots
bj_M6w_LGgw,417599,418960,and lots of food today but we're now at
bj_M6w_LGgw,418960,420479,the harbor galley restaurant where we're
bj_M6w_LGgw,420479,422400,gonna get a lobster roll did i come here
bj_M6w_LGgw,422400,423599,today thinking i was gonna order a
bj_M6w_LGgw,423599,425280,lobster roll nope but being from new
bj_M6w_LGgw,425280,426800,england if anyone knows a good lobster
bj_M6w_LGgw,426800,429280,roll it's me i'm gonna unfire manny this
bj_M6w_LGgw,429280,430910,is so good larry i'm sorry
bj_M6w_LGgw,430910,433840,[Music]
bj_M6w_LGgw,433840,435680,it actually smells okay but we are not
bj_M6w_LGgw,435680,437280,off to a promising start by the look of
bj_M6w_LGgw,437280,438479,this thing
bj_M6w_LGgw,438479,440080,what they lack in the fresh lobster they
bj_M6w_LGgw,440080,441680,make up for in the seasoning it's almost
bj_M6w_LGgw,441680,443440,got a sort of cajun spice to it which i
bj_M6w_LGgw,443440,444720,sort of like it's a good seven out of
bj_M6w_LGgw,444720,446080,ten lobster roll but we're on to the
bj_M6w_LGgw,446080,448000,most famous sandwich in disneyland this
bj_M6w_LGgw,448000,449599,restaurant here is a three-month wait
bj_M6w_LGgw,449599,451120,list and the famous thing to get here is
bj_M6w_LGgw,451120,453039,the monte cristo sandwich it's basically
bj_M6w_LGgw,453039,454720,just a deep fried ham and cheese
bj_M6w_LGgw,454720,456400,sandwich it smells really good and i
bj_M6w_LGgw,456400,458479,hope it tastes even better i know this
bj_M6w_LGgw,458479,460400,sounds crazy because i never do this but
bj_M6w_LGgw,460400,461759,this is better than the turkey leg and
bj_M6w_LGgw,461759,463280,that got a 10 out of 10. so i've got to
bj_M6w_LGgw,463280,466319,give this one an 11.
bj_M6w_LGgw,471919,473360,this big old feast in front of me is
bj_M6w_LGgw,473360,474960,from pizza planet they must be filling
bj_M6w_LGgw,474960,476479,me with this what is this it doesn't
bj_M6w_LGgw,476479,478160,even look like they put it in the oven
bj_M6w_LGgw,478160,479680,that's raw dough oh god it's just
bj_M6w_LGgw,479680,480960,horrible they've loaded this thing with
bj_M6w_LGgw,480960,482720,more pineapple than the dole wood we had
bj_M6w_LGgw,482720,484160,earlier
bj_M6w_LGgw,484160,486080,roasted i'm not even gonna try this
bj_M6w_LGgw,486080,487919,pizza pizza pizza pizza as for this one
bj_M6w_LGgw,487919,489199,right here this looks like a chucky
bj_M6w_LGgw,489199,490479,cheese piece of pizza it doesn't look
bj_M6w_LGgw,490479,491599,bad it doesn't look good but it's
bj_M6w_LGgw,491599,493360,probably not going to taste very good my
bj_M6w_LGgw,493360,494560,honest review of this is that it's just
bj_M6w_LGgw,494560,496160,sort of a sad piece of pizza this is
bj_M6w_LGgw,496160,498000,apparently the pizza place from toy
bj_M6w_LGgw,498000,499360,story so i guess that means it's like
bj_M6w_LGgw,499360,501199,fake crop pizza and that's exactly what
bj_M6w_LGgw,501199,502720,it tastes like plastic the pasta here
bj_M6w_LGgw,502720,504160,doesn't look terrible but let's face it
bj_M6w_LGgw,504160,506479,we know this is not homemade it's a
bj_M6w_LGgw,506479,508000,pretty simple alfredo sauce but it's
bj_M6w_LGgw,508000,510160,very very well seasoned that touchini
bj_M6w_LGgw,510160,512479,alfredo time to carboload i'm not even
bj_M6w_LGgw,512479,513680,going to try a piece of the chicken with
bj_M6w_LGgw,513680,515279,the fake grill marks on it 2 out of 10
bj_M6w_LGgw,515279,516880,for the pizza but a 4 out of 10 for the
bj_M6w_LGgw,516880,519880,pasta
bj_M6w_LGgw,523599,524480,wait
bj_M6w_LGgw,524480,527120,here there whatever you're doing i doubt
bj_M6w_LGgw,527120,530640,you're authorized okay let's all relax
bj_M6w_LGgw,530640,532399,we are now in the star wars area and
bj_M6w_LGgw,532399,533760,what we have right behind me is what
bj_M6w_LGgw,533760,535600,i've been waiting for the entire day
bj_M6w_LGgw,535600,537839,it's the famous blue milk from star wars
bj_M6w_LGgw,537839,541440,and apparently it's fantastic
bj_M6w_LGgw,543920,545200,one of my favorite drinks out there is
bj_M6w_LGgw,545200,546800,horchata which is that rice milk
bj_M6w_LGgw,546800,548240,flavored with cinnamon sugar that kind
bj_M6w_LGgw,548240,549600,of thing this is probably similar to
bj_M6w_LGgw,549600,551040,that but just better i have been waiting
bj_M6w_LGgw,551040,552880,for this the entire day
bj_M6w_LGgw,552880,554320,and basically just tastes like creamy
bj_M6w_LGgw,554320,556000,italian ice it's a nice refreshing way
bj_M6w_LGgw,556000,557120,to end the day i know you're supposed to
bj_M6w_LGgw,557120,558720,come to disneyland and do the rides but
bj_M6w_LGgw,558720,560080,we spent more time just eating today
bj_M6w_LGgw,560080,561920,then again i did buy a 30 000 flight
bj_M6w_LGgw,561920,563200,ticket the other day just to eat the
bj_M6w_LGgw,563200,564680,whole time as well happy cooking
