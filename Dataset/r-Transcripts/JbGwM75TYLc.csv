JbGwM75TYLc,2000,5940,"Man, stop bullsh*tting. If you've really got a problem with your life"
JbGwM75TYLc,5940,9380,you'll change it. You're not tired of being broke
JbGwM75TYLc,9380,11990,you're not tired of being stuck you're not tired.
JbGwM75TYLc,11990,15840,Because if you were tired you would actually do some sh*t about it.
JbGwM75TYLc,15840,20350,I'm tired of everybody running around complaining as if you're on the receiving end
JbGwM75TYLc,20350,24840,of whatever this world wants to dump on you and you don't have a choice.
JbGwM75TYLc,24840,28570,"It's time to grow up, man. Excuses sound best"
JbGwM75TYLc,28570,33090,to the person who is making them up. Anybody who is determined to do something
JbGwM75TYLc,33090,37960,who wants something to be different it will eventually be different.
JbGwM75TYLc,37960,40870,Everything around you is going to change as soon as you change
JbGwM75TYLc,40870,43540,the things around you. Change your mind
JbGwM75TYLc,43540,46380,and everything about your bank account your surroundings
JbGwM75TYLc,46380,49680,your environment will all change.
JbGwM75TYLc,49680,53720,And I know that can be hard that's why people lose the war.
JbGwM75TYLc,53720,58070,That's why people never achieve their strategic goals.
JbGwM75TYLc,58070,59718,They lose the little battles
JbGwM75TYLc,59719,63629,the death of 1000 cuts. One missed work out at a time.
JbGwM75TYLc,63629,66390,And then another. And then another
JbGwM75TYLc,66390,67780,and it all adds up why?
JbGwM75TYLc,67780,73350,Because we don't think about the big picture. We don't see
JbGwM75TYLc,73350,75060,the decay. We are like the frog
JbGwM75TYLc,75060,80740,boiling in the pot. As the temperature slowly increases.
JbGwM75TYLc,80740,83759,One degree at a time. One degree closer to death.
JbGwM75TYLc,83760,85799,One degree closer
JbGwM75TYLc,85799,89230,to failure. I'm gonna tell you what people don't want
JbGwM75TYLc,89230,91310,to tell you. Why you stop
JbGwM75TYLc,91310,97450,is because you're lazy. You don't mind
JbGwM75TYLc,97450,99600,getting bad grades in school. It doesn't bother you enough
JbGwM75TYLc,99600,100890,to be mediocre to be average.
JbGwM75TYLc,100890,106369,To sit around and watch people do great things.
JbGwM75TYLc,106369,110180,You don't mind it. You don't care enough about yourself.
JbGwM75TYLc,110180,112280,"When that mind gets relaxed, man you are f*cked."
JbGwM75TYLc,112280,113500,It's supposed to be hard man it's supposed to be grimy
JbGwM75TYLc,113500,115890,it's supposed to be gritty it's supposed to be horrible
JbGwM75TYLc,115890,121040,it's supposed to be really ugly. I'm supposed to be battered
JbGwM75TYLc,121040,122420,I'm supposed to be bruised I'm supposed to be beaten.
JbGwM75TYLc,122420,123420,Your mind has to touch
JbGwM75TYLc,123420,124420,hardship. It's how you start to create
JbGwM75TYLc,124420,126460,the calloused mind. This is how I'm going to grow.
JbGwM75TYLc,126460,132870,"For every level, there's another devil. It is the devil's job"
JbGwM75TYLc,132870,135590,to create challenges obstacle courses
JbGwM75TYLc,135590,138599,and issues and conflicts insecurities
JbGwM75TYLc,138599,140400,fear sending people
JbGwM75TYLc,140400,142680,to talk you out of your mission.
JbGwM75TYLc,142680,146530,'Cause he wants to put you to a test. But I can tell you now
JbGwM75TYLc,146530,150300,I piss the devil off every day. Because I just don't stop.
JbGwM75TYLc,150300,153290,This f*cking guy. Every time
JbGwM75TYLc,153290,155590,he does it. Doesn't matter if he gets sick
JbGwM75TYLc,155590,158500,it doesn't matter what happens to his money or his finances
JbGwM75TYLc,158500,162250,he gets out of his bed and he's on a mission to get it done.
JbGwM75TYLc,162250,166530,Unless you get out every single motherf*cking day
JbGwM75TYLc,166530,169069,and put in the work inch by inch
JbGwM75TYLc,169069,172730,by motherf*cking inch you will never get there.
JbGwM75TYLc,172730,175790,Everybody wanna win but everybody don't want to work.
JbGwM75TYLc,175790,179019,Everybody want the reward but everybody don't want to work.
JbGwM75TYLc,179019,183170,We all gotta work. All I'm saying is don't quit.
JbGwM75TYLc,183170,187319,I didn't say don't rest. I didn't say don't recover.
JbGwM75TYLc,187319,189400,"I said, don't quit. Mentally"
JbGwM75TYLc,189400,190400,"you ain't got to take off. Mentally, you can stay"
JbGwM75TYLc,190400,191739,connected. You see people who do big things
JbGwM75TYLc,191739,194740,and you automatically say that guy's so lucky.
JbGwM75TYLc,194740,197100,She's so lucky. You don't know that.
JbGwM75TYLc,197100,199380,You're assuming that. Going to work every f*cking day
JbGwM75TYLc,199380,202519,for 20 f*cking years and grinding your ass off
JbGwM75TYLc,202519,205260,and then becoming a multimillionaire that's not luck.
JbGwM75TYLc,205260,208000,That's action and reaction. Quit using the word luck
JbGwM75TYLc,208000,210920,quit believing in luck and start believing in work.
JbGwM75TYLc,210920,213440,Start believing in results that come from your actions.
JbGwM75TYLc,213440,216890,Isn't it about time you become that person you knew you always could be?
JbGwM75TYLc,216890,218980,How do you do that? You break the f*cking mold guys.
JbGwM75TYLc,218980,221390,"You get the f*ck out of bed when it's cold, when it's early"
JbGwM75TYLc,221390,223580,and go for a f*cking run. Commit to one-day
JbGwM75TYLc,223580,225760,"and see how you feel. Mentally, you will feel like"
JbGwM75TYLc,225760,227920,"wow, man that was f*cking alive."
JbGwM75TYLc,227920,230400,You can't talk it all the time you've gotta walk it.
JbGwM75TYLc,230400,232360,"Commit to one day try it, see how it feels"
JbGwM75TYLc,232360,234370,Getting up that f*cking early when everyone else is asleep
JbGwM75TYLc,234370,238049,"or when it's that cold when everybody else says no, this is not comfortable"
JbGwM75TYLc,238049,239489,you shouldn't do this you say yes motherf*cker
JbGwM75TYLc,239489,241019,I'm gonna introduce myself to it.
