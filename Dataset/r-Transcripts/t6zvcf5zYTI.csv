t6zvcf5zYTI,65197,66366,What a dump.
t6zvcf5zYTI,66666,69102,Looks like nobody's been here for years.
t6zvcf5zYTI,69469,72538,It's creepy. [sniffing]
t6zvcf5zYTI,72672,74673,And it smells like dead bugs.
t6zvcf5zYTI,75208,76409,Can we please not talk about dead bugs

t6zvcf5zYTI,129395,131597,Can I pet your squirrel?
t6zvcf5zYTI,132465,135101,"Uh, little lady, this is no squirrel."
t6zvcf5zYTI,135268,136536,This here's a mustache.
t6zvcf5zYTI,137169,138838,Does he like nuts?
t6zvcf5zYTI,140205,142041,- Nuts? - Your squirrel.

t6zvcf5zYTI,163262,165264,"You know, hosting the iCarly Awards"
t6zvcf5zYTI,165397,166899,has always been a dream of mine.

t6zvcf5zYTI,176342,177810,I thought you made up with her!
t6zvcf5zYTI,177943,179245,I did.
t6zvcf5zYTI,179378,181881,She's just acting all tough for the crowd.
t6zvcf5zYTI,182048,184717,"I'll do it, too. Hey, Shelby!"

t6zvcf5zYTI,213579,214946,"Now, Carly, what are your thoughts"
t6zvcf5zYTI,215080,217082,about America's dependence on foreign oil?
t6zvcf5zYTI,217583,219685,"Well, America's dependence on foreign oil"
t6zvcf5zYTI,219819,222421,is definitely an issue but I feel that
t6zvcf5zYTI,222555,226426,"if we all work together, we can... end world hunger..."

t6zvcf5zYTI,233165,234099,What?
t6zvcf5zYTI,234600,236669,You told me to clean the juicer ports?
t6zvcf5zYTI,236802,240373,"No, I said to read the juice reports."
t6zvcf5zYTI,243042,244309,What is a juice report?
t6zvcf5zYTI,244676,246512,It's part of the fruit newsletter.
t6zvcf5zYTI,247813,248881,[scoffs]
t6zvcf5zYTI,250115,251016,Sorry.
t6zvcf5zYTI,251150,252418,"Oh, come on, Carly."
t6zvcf5zYTI,252618,255922,"So your room burned down, look at the bright side."
t6zvcf5zYTI,259691,260959,What's the bright side?!
t6zvcf5zYTI,261092,264129,Excuse me. That was totally uncalled for.
t6zvcf5zYTI,264263,265731,- Who are you? - His sister.
t6zvcf5zYTI,265864,267967,And there was no reason for you to knee him in the-- Oh!
t6zvcf5zYTI,270236,271904,"Yeah, you'd better walk away!"
t6zvcf5zYTI,273239,276809,Ow. She stomped on me with her bony old foot.
t6zvcf5zYTI,278110,279612,This is nice.
t6zvcf5zYTI,280179,281347,Yeah.
t6zvcf5zYTI,282148,283750,That's a lot more fun hanging here with you
t6zvcf5zYTI,283883,286286,than that dumb girl from the hardware store.
t6zvcf5zYTI,287787,288853,Thanks.
t6zvcf5zYTI,289588,291491,I'm sorry she stole your wallet.
t6zvcf5zYTI,293293,296262,It's okay. There's only $4 in it.
t6zvcf5zYTI,296396,298363,- Bye Carly. - See ya at school.
t6zvcf5zYTI,298998,300232,And you should go to bed.
t6zvcf5zYTI,300366,302869,No way. There is  A Boy Meets World marathon on
t6zvcf5zYTI,303002,304871,starting at midnight. Oh!
t6zvcf5zYTI,305004,306138,You're not watching that.
t6zvcf5zYTI,306272,307540,But it's Ben Savage.
t6zvcf5zYTI,308174,309875,You need to get some sleep. You promised that guy
t6zvcf5zYTI,310008,311610,you'd finish his sculpture by the end of the week
t6zvcf5zYTI,311744,313245,and you haven't even started on it.
t6zvcf5zYTI,313379,316014,"You see a girl around here about this tall, brown hair?"
t6zvcf5zYTI,316149,318685,"No, I... no, no. [chuckles]"
t6zvcf5zYTI,318818,322055,Not really. I'm Patty Schwab. [chuckles]

t6zvcf5zYTI,338070,342008,I'm tuna sushi. See my ginger and wasabi?
t6zvcf5zYTI,343309,344843,I thought you were Toro sushi.
t6zvcf5zYTI,344977,347012,- What's Toro? - Fatty tuna.
t6zvcf5zYTI,347446,352051,"No, I'm not fatty tuna. Thank you."
t6zvcf5zYTI,352184,353418,What the jack? What is that?
t6zvcf5zYTI,353552,354954,A tick gasser.
t6zvcf5zYTI,355087,357289,You know how I used to give Freddie tick baths?
t6zvcf5zYTI,357422,358957,Yeah.
t6zvcf5zYTI,359091,362228,"Well, now I can get rid of ticks with this industrial gasser."
t6zvcf5zYTI,362628,363695,Industrial?
t6zvcf5zYTI,365130,366632,[screaming]
t6zvcf5zYTI,366766,370134,You might feel a powerful burning sensation!
t6zvcf5zYTI,370269,373672,I do! [screaming]
t6zvcf5zYTI,374106,375340,You look so pretty.

t6zvcf5zYTI,389155,390122,Spencer!
t6zvcf5zYTI,390256,391991,[both] Outfit montage!
t6zvcf5zYTI,392358,394359,[music playing]
t6zvcf5zYTI,394493,395561,It's hurting my retinas.
t6zvcf5zYTI,396328,399932,I feel like the lining of a really expensive casket.
t6zvcf5zYTI,400833,405771,Too frilly. Too silly. Too racy. Too spacey.
t6zvcf5zYTI,405905,409542,Too flirty. Too birdie.
t6zvcf5zYTI,409675,411076,Can I have everyone's attention?
t6zvcf5zYTI,411209,413879,"I have something to say, and I know it's gonna shock"
t6zvcf5zYTI,414012,415214,most of you.
t6zvcf5zYTI,415347,418818,"We're getting married. Prunela's out, Carly's in."
t6zvcf5zYTI,418951,420086,[gasping]
t6zvcf5zYTI,422255,424757,[wedding march playing]
t6zvcf5zYTI,424890,428460,Wow. Didn't ask me to walk her down the aisle. Okay.
t6zvcf5zYTI,429328,434733,What? We're not getting married? No. No. No.
t6zvcf5zYTI,434867,437169,"Uh, I hope you didn't wait too long."
t6zvcf5zYTI,437670,439037,I would hate for you to get soggy.
t6zvcf5zYTI,439404,440738,Oh. [chuckles]
t6zvcf5zYTI,440873,443176,This? It's just for a silly internet thing.
t6zvcf5zYTI,443376,444744,I'm Taco Tina.
t6zvcf5zYTI,444944,446645,"I'm a taco, but I have all the same problems"
t6zvcf5zYTI,446779,447780,as any other girl. [chuckles]
t6zvcf5zYTI,447914,449415,Including car troubles?
t6zvcf5zYTI,449582,450716,"Uh, 'cause according to Quadruplet,"
t6zvcf5zYTI,450850,451951,you've called a tow truck nine times
t6zvcf5zYTI,452385,453552,in the last six months.
t6zvcf5zYTI,453686,456188,"What? No, I'm sure it's not that many."
t6zvcf5zYTI,456355,458324,Really? 'Cause you get the tenth tow for free.
t6zvcf5zYTI,458891,460960,"Oh, yeah. You know, it has been nine."
