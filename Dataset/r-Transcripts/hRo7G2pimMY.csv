hRo7G2pimMY,2639,5279,not any old crafter van oh no this one
hRo7G2pimMY,5279,7120,has been modified by a company called
hRo7G2pimMY,7120,11599,cjl leisure and costs 150
hRo7G2pimMY,11599,14320,000 pounds why does it cost that much
hRo7G2pimMY,14320,16480,well it's quite possibly the ultimate
hRo7G2pimMY,16480,18960,adventure van for a cyclist which is
hRo7G2pimMY,18960,20880,handy because i'm traveling to the
hRo7G2pimMY,20880,23119,global bike festival in salbac and i
hRo7G2pimMY,23119,25519,need some transportation i think this

hRo7G2pimMY,34719,36880,that are crammed in to this absolute
hRo7G2pimMY,36880,39880,beast
hRo7G2pimMY,41550,45520,[Music]
hRo7G2pimMY,45520,48399,in recent years camper vans have become
hRo7G2pimMY,48399,50719,really popular and you can understand

hRo7G2pimMY,55680,58559,your van put your bikes in it drive to
hRo7G2pimMY,58559,60559,an amazing location where you can then
hRo7G2pimMY,60559,63680,wake up with a ridiculous view and then
hRo7G2pimMY,63680,66720,go for a bucket list ride somewhere like
hRo7G2pimMY,66720,68960,salbac if that sounds like something
hRo7G2pimMY,68960,70799,you'd like to do you've got a number of
hRo7G2pimMY,70799,73920,options you can convert a van much like
hRo7G2pimMY,73920,76479,what blake is doing over on gmbn
hRo7G2pimMY,76479,79040,or you can hire a van from various
hRo7G2pimMY,79040,80560,different places
hRo7G2pimMY,80560,83439,or if you've got the money you can buy

hRo7G2pimMY,102640,105439,custom upholstered uh stitched leather
hRo7G2pimMY,105439,109040,seats that i'm rather enjoying and um
hRo7G2pimMY,109040,111200,it's well capable of operating fully off
hRo7G2pimMY,111200,114640,the grid uh with wi-fi its own power
hRo7G2pimMY,114640,116799,system and water

hRo7G2pimMY,120640,123200,look pretty crap isn't it
hRo7G2pimMY,123200,126079,yeah but i'm gonna have to hot-foot it
hRo7G2pimMY,126079,129520,and use all of the 180 buff ponies under
hRo7G2pimMY,129520,131440,my right foot in order for us to make it
hRo7G2pimMY,131440,133200,to dover so i can make the ferry
hRo7G2pimMY,133200,134800,crossing or
hRo7G2pimMY,134800,137280,we ain't going to sell back so
hRo7G2pimMY,137280,139720,i'm going to push on
hRo7G2pimMY,139720,143039,[Music]
hRo7G2pimMY,146080,148640,the van also features a
hRo7G2pimMY,148640,151120,absolutely brilliant alpine sound system
hRo7G2pimMY,151120,153519,which sounds fantastic but normally it
hRo7G2pimMY,153519,156800,would be filling the airwaves with uh
hRo7G2pimMY,156800,159280,what my usual selection of carefully
hRo7G2pimMY,159280,162720,curated 80s bangers and jazz funk
hRo7G2pimMY,162720,165519,however due to copyright restrictions i
hRo7G2pimMY,165519,167440,can't subject you to those so instead
hRo7G2pimMY,167440,168879,we're going to listen to the oral
hRo7G2pimMY,168879,172879,delights of mizorski and a night on bald
hRo7G2pimMY,172879,174640,mountain which is
hRo7G2pimMY,174640,177680,free from copyright
hRo7G2pimMY,183519,185760,just boarded the ferry made it to the
hRo7G2pimMY,185760,188480,crossing it's a nighttime one um and
hRo7G2pimMY,188480,189599,when we get to the side we're going to
hRo7G2pimMY,189599,192159,go through the full meat and potatoes
hRo7G2pimMY,192159,194640,of this van so that you can see all its
hRo7G2pimMY,194640,196800,sort of functions and what it's capable
hRo7G2pimMY,196800,197599,of
hRo7G2pimMY,197599,198720,but
hRo7G2pimMY,198720,200480,right now i'm in the weird situation was
hRo7G2pimMY,200480,202879,the first time in my life where having
hRo7G2pimMY,202879,205280,got on the ferry i have to leave the
hRo7G2pimMY,205280,208400,luxury and serenity of this rather nice
hRo7G2pimMY,208400,210480,interior and go inside the ferry which
hRo7G2pimMY,210480,213360,isn't quite as nice um i'd much rather
hRo7G2pimMY,213360,215440,stay in the va
hRo7G2pimMY,215440,218000,health and safety gotta go inside
hRo7G2pimMY,218000,219840,there but it's not going anywhere come
hRo7G2pimMY,219840,221440,back here and resume the drive
hRo7G2pimMY,221440,222400,afterwards
hRo7G2pimMY,222400,223680,anyway
hRo7G2pimMY,223680,225900,all right let's do it
hRo7G2pimMY,225900,235189,[Music]
hRo7G2pimMY,237680,242228,[Music]
hRo7G2pimMY,242319,244640,this journey's long so i'm going to take
hRo7G2pimMY,244640,246480,a break and have a little 30 minute
hRo7G2pimMY,246480,249360,pound out this vehicle is ideal for that
hRo7G2pimMY,249360,252000,as mentioned it sleeps for people and it
hRo7G2pimMY,252000,254959,does so by way of this big double bed at
hRo7G2pimMY,254959,256000,the back of the vehicle which is
hRo7G2pimMY,256000,258079,actually like well over six foot long
hRo7G2pimMY,258079,260320,end to end here so six foot one me it's
hRo7G2pimMY,260320,262000,fine like stretched out in it that's
hRo7G2pimMY,262000,263840,proper cool and then the other bed
hRo7G2pimMY,263840,266400,you've got is where the seats and table
hRo7G2pimMY,266400,268560,are they the table can be pushed down
hRo7G2pimMY,268560,270479,and that can be converted into a another
hRo7G2pimMY,270479,273120,bed that can in theory sleep two people
hRo7G2pimMY,273120,275040,so ideal plus you've got all these like
hRo7G2pimMY,275040,277120,blinds and stuff they can come across
hRo7G2pimMY,277120,279440,the windows to make it just totally
hRo7G2pimMY,279440,281600,blacked out and get out all the light
hRo7G2pimMY,281600,284479,kiff this is the life right powering up
hRo7G2pimMY,284479,286720,time
hRo7G2pimMY,290160,292080,oh if you're uh
hRo7G2pimMY,292080,293440,anything like me first thing in the

hRo7G2pimMY,300000,301680,the same time because we've got a
hRo7G2pimMY,301680,305600,built-in toilet shower and sink
hRo7G2pimMY,305600,312720,[Music]
hRo7G2pimMY,312720,314400,for me the biggest attraction of a van
hRo7G2pimMY,314400,316800,is you get to your destination you go to
hRo7G2pimMY,316800,318639,sleep you wake up and then you're
hRo7G2pimMY,318639,321280,presented
hRo7G2pimMY,322160,323759,with a view
hRo7G2pimMY,323759,325280,like that
hRo7G2pimMY,325280,327120,which is priceless isn't it
hRo7G2pimMY,327120,328960,look at this
hRo7G2pimMY,328960,330960,soundback now i'm outside i'm going to
hRo7G2pimMY,330960,332080,show you some more of the other features
hRo7G2pimMY,332080,333520,of the van starting with this huge
hRo7G2pimMY,333520,335520,awning that's across this side it's
hRo7G2pimMY,335520,337360,electric and it's controlled by these
hRo7G2pimMY,337360,339680,buttons here so you can you know full-on
hRo7G2pimMY,339680,341919,camp here and get out the sun if you
hRo7G2pimMY,341919,343680,need to it's very warm here today it's
hRo7G2pimMY,343680,345600,like over 30 degrees we've also got
hRo7G2pimMY,345600,347360,these upgraded wheels which just look
hRo7G2pimMY,347360,349600,the part that ozed racing wheels like
hRo7G2pimMY,349600,351280,rally car wheels they just look proper
hRo7G2pimMY,351280,352560,cool and they've got these big high
hRo7G2pimMY,352560,354880,volume off-road falcon tires on them
hRo7G2pimMY,354880,357440,which kind of i mean they look the part
hRo7G2pimMY,357440,358880,they look really cool but they're also a
hRo7G2pimMY,358880,360080,bit functional because it stops you
hRo7G2pimMY,360080,361680,curbing your wheels and
hRo7G2pimMY,361680,362800,they've just got so much more tyre
hRo7G2pimMY,362800,364319,volume it adds quite a bit of comfort to
hRo7G2pimMY,364319,366479,a big vehicle like this but round the
hRo7G2pimMY,366479,368160,back that's where it really gets going
hRo7G2pimMY,368160,370560,follow me so at the back of the van this
hRo7G2pimMY,370560,373600,is where the business end is so inside
hRo7G2pimMY,373600,375759,here
hRo7G2pimMY,375759,377440,you can see
hRo7G2pimMY,377440,378639,we've got
hRo7G2pimMY,378639,381680,the racking for four bikes so i've got
hRo7G2pimMY,381680,384080,two of my bikes in here and it's really
hRo7G2pimMY,384080,385600,cool because it pulls out it's very

hRo7G2pimMY,400319,401600,this side
hRo7G2pimMY,401600,402639,i've
hRo7G2pimMY,402639,403520,just
hRo7G2pimMY,403520,405120,because i've only taken two bikes you
hRo7G2pimMY,405120,407120,could put four in
hRo7G2pimMY,407120,408639,i've got my front wheels that are

hRo7G2pimMY,434720,436639,get your bikes out here you can actually
hRo7G2pimMY,436639,438800,do it with using the racking so they're
hRo7G2pimMY,438800,439919,on the racking and they're secure and
hRo7G2pimMY,439919,442160,then just jet wash them down clean them
hRo7G2pimMY,442160,444639,after your ride which is ideal and then

hRo7G2pimMY,466080,467360,like you're a mountain biker you've done
hRo7G2pimMY,467360,468720,a gravel ride and you're covered in crap
hRo7G2pimMY,468720,470080,you don't want to go inside the van and
