NXdc3hxH6gw,200,1610,- What's going on GQ.
NXdc3hxH6gw,1610,5820,"I'm Daniel Ricciardo, Formula 1 driver, sometimes very fast."
NXdc3hxH6gw,5820,7680,"And today, I'm going undercover on the internet."
NXdc3hxH6gw,7680,8900,Let's do it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,8900,10702,It's actually me.
NXdc3hxH6gw,11860,12693,Quora.
NXdc3hxH6gw,13860,14849,What's Quora?
NXdc3hxH6gw,14850,17540,Why does Daniel Ricciardo squat before racing?
NXdc3hxH6gw,17540,18700,Glad you noticed.
NXdc3hxH6gw,18700,20870,It's kind of a comfortable position for me.
NXdc3hxH6gw,20870,23140,"Open up the hips, the adductors,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,23140,24330,sound like I know what I'm doing.
NXdc3hxH6gw,24330,26130,And it's just a way for me to kind of
NXdc3hxH6gw,26130,27699,get into my like little space.
NXdc3hxH6gw,27700,29170,I've got my headphones on.
NXdc3hxH6gw,29170,31410,"It's my happy, quiet place"
NXdc3hxH6gw,31410,33370,before essentially I go into battle.
NXdc3hxH6gw,33370,35370,I could never do that squat a few years ago.
NXdc3hxH6gw,35370,38300,Now I can and I like it very much.
NXdc3hxH6gw,38300,39680,"All right, next one."
NXdc3hxH6gw,39680,42060,How does jet lag affect F1 drivers
NXdc3hxH6gw,42060,43950,given that they are rounding the globe
NXdc3hxH6gw,43950,45560,literally throughout the year?
NXdc3hxH6gw,45560,48040,"Honest answer, I am jet lagged as we speak."
NXdc3hxH6gw,48040,51240,"So, it's something you just learn to deal with."
NXdc3hxH6gw,51240,53020,"We can prepare a little bit,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,53020,54640,"so before a certain time zone,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,54640,56030,we might try to adapt a few nights
NXdc3hxH6gw,56030,57559,"before getting onto that time zone,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,57560,60610,but sometimes you just kind of have to suck it up
NXdc3hxH6gw,60610,61443,and push through it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,61443,63050,"Everyone thinks like you get used to it,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,63050,64220,"you've been doing it for so long,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,64220,65850,"but sometimes it's luck,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,65850,68513,sometimes I will sleep awesomely and sometimes not.
NXdc3hxH6gw,69440,72630,What is the typical diet of an F1 driver?
NXdc3hxH6gw,72630,74810,"Well, we have to stay light."
NXdc3hxH6gw,74810,77680,"We certainly need some diet, if you will,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,77680,81460,to maintain weight or maintain a low weight.
NXdc3hxH6gw,81460,83060,Every extra bit of weight we carry
NXdc3hxH6gw,83060,84890,can be a detriment to our lap time.
NXdc3hxH6gw,84890,88310,"So like 10 kilos, I guess that's 22 pounds,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,88310,92009,"is about 0.3, 0.4 of a second per lap."
NXdc3hxH6gw,92010,93690,So that's a lot in racing terms.
NXdc3hxH6gw,93690,95380,"So yeah, we need to stay light."
NXdc3hxH6gw,95380,97729,"I mean, fortunately, I like my veggies,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,97730,98830,I like all that sort of stuff.
NXdc3hxH6gw,98830,102390,"So I'm pretty good, if I need to stay lean, I can."
NXdc3hxH6gw,102390,105000,"At the age I am, I'm still quite fortunate,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,105000,107300,"my metabolism is moving at a rapid rate,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,107300,109570,So I'm able to keep the weight off pretty easily
NXdc3hxH6gw,109570,111980,so I can still afford to have some good meals
NXdc3hxH6gw,111980,114010,and not struggle too much with that.
NXdc3hxH6gw,114010,115120,Posted.
NXdc3hxH6gw,115120,116990,Instagram.
NXdc3hxH6gw,116990,117823,Alrighty.
NXdc3hxH6gw,119370,122160,"We need your playlist, please."
NXdc3hxH6gw,122160,127160,"So yes, I love music and I'm kind of a music snob in a way"
NXdc3hxH6gw,128210,130640,where I've always been into stuff
NXdc3hxH6gw,130640,132990,that not everyone finds straight away.
NXdc3hxH6gw,132990,134780,I love being the first to find something
NXdc3hxH6gw,134780,136120,"or at least within my group of friends,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,136120,138409,"like, hey, check this guy out or check this girl out"
NXdc3hxH6gw,138410,139689,or this group.
NXdc3hxH6gw,139689,142280,"This is something, I've always loved it."
NXdc3hxH6gw,142280,144500,"I have a thing called three by three,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,144500,147460,"so it's three songs by me,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,147460,149510,"the three, that's my race number."
NXdc3hxH6gw,149510,151099,And I'll do that every week.
NXdc3hxH6gw,151100,152870,So I'll do three of my favorite songs
NXdc3hxH6gw,152870,154610,"maybe that I'm listening to that week,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,154610,156780,and I'll put them up on my story.
NXdc3hxH6gw,156780,158080,"People appreciate that,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,158080,161280,but I ain't gonna go sharing a playlist just like that.
NXdc3hxH6gw,161280,163200,"I worked hard to build these playlists,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,163200,165620,"so I'll drip feed them, I'll drip feed them."
NXdc3hxH6gw,165620,167370,It must be interesting to know
NXdc3hxH6gw,167370,169610,what is the feeling of the F1 drivers
NXdc3hxH6gw,169610,171590,when they're driving a simple car.
NXdc3hxH6gw,171590,174739,I'm very happy driving a normal car on the road
NXdc3hxH6gw,174740,176300,and just kind of doing it simple.
NXdc3hxH6gw,176300,178230,"Everyone asks, do you drive fast on the road?"
NXdc3hxH6gw,178230,181409,Do you just always want to impress your friends and stuff?
NXdc3hxH6gw,181410,184400,"And I think because we race the fastest cars in the world,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,184400,186590,we simply get it out of our system.
NXdc3hxH6gw,186590,188856,"I guess the desire to drive fast on the road,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,188856,190160,it's not there.
NXdc3hxH6gw,190160,192560,"And I'm more like, I'm chill, play music,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,192560,195160,"put the windows down, I'm happy."
NXdc3hxH6gw,195160,197100,There has been people that have pulled up next to me
NXdc3hxH6gw,197100,198150,"like at a set of lights,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,198150,200680,"and there was one guy once in a sports car,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,200680,202519,and I was not in a sports car at that time.
NXdc3hxH6gw,202520,205037,"And he's like revving and he wanted to race me,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,205037,206490,"and I was like, yeah, let's race,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,206490,208070,and I was being sarcastic.
NXdc3hxH6gw,208070,211240,"So he went off at the lights, and he won,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,211240,213370,and he probably still tell his friends to this day
NXdc3hxH6gw,213370,214670,that he beat me in a race.
NXdc3hxH6gw,216560,219450,Still on the Bill's Mafia hype today?
NXdc3hxH6gw,219450,222370,"Well, I'm gonna answer that right now, absolutely."
NXdc3hxH6gw,222370,225310,Even more so than what I was on this day
NXdc3hxH6gw,225310,227140,that the photo was taken.
NXdc3hxH6gw,227140,230620,"I've really, really got into NFL the last few years."
NXdc3hxH6gw,230620,233950,And I am Bill's Mafia for life now.
NXdc3hxH6gw,233950,235120,I ain't leaving.
NXdc3hxH6gw,235120,239360,"TikTok. Oh, the platform, which I really don't enjoy"
NXdc3hxH6gw,239360,241880,- Top three wishes for the new owners of F1
NXdc3hxH6gw,241880,243420,- Race in Vegas.
NXdc3hxH6gw,243420,245500,How excited is Daniel for Vegas?
NXdc3hxH6gw,245500,247940,I wonder if he's gonna be in those casinos
NXdc3hxH6gw,247940,249570,or leave with a new tattoo.
NXdc3hxH6gw,249570,251400,So I do really like Vegas.
NXdc3hxH6gw,251400,253060,I went through a good run at Vegas
NXdc3hxH6gw,253060,255646,"where I was going every year for a few years,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,255646,257299,if not twice a year.
NXdc3hxH6gw,257299,259979,But I'm not really a casino player.
NXdc3hxH6gw,259980,262840,"I just love the pool parties, the day parties,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,262840,266100,and then they inevitably flow into the night scene.
NXdc3hxH6gw,266100,267560,So it was kind of a time
NXdc3hxH6gw,267560,269000,where I was just really enjoying
NXdc3hxH6gw,269000,270580,"letting my hair down and having a good time,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,270580,272419,and Vegas was my happy place.
NXdc3hxH6gw,272420,274300,I think Vegas is gonna test us
NXdc3hxH6gw,274300,276030,when we have to compete there for sure.
NXdc3hxH6gw,276030,277500,"The way I'll approach it is like,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,277500,279190,"I'm there for a job,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,279190,280610,"and if I do that job well,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,280610,283969,then I can enjoy Vegas I guess the night of the race
NXdc3hxH6gw,283970,285370,"or the night after the race,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,285370,286919,or maybe I'll stay for a few days.
NXdc3hxH6gw,286920,289380,"But I'm also in my 30s now,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,289380,292090,so I'm not like mid late 20s anymore.
NXdc3hxH6gw,292090,293419,"So I don't know, maybe Vegas,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,293420,294810,maybe that was a time in my life.
NXdc3hxH6gw,294810,297310,"We'll see, we'll see how tempted I get going back."
NXdc3hxH6gw,299980,301850,Do the boys do their own straps
NXdc3hxH6gw,301850,304610,or do they get strapped in by one of the crew and why?
NXdc3hxH6gw,304610,307479,We don't have enough mobility in that confined space
NXdc3hxH6gw,307480,308990,to do the buckles.
NXdc3hxH6gw,308990,312060,"So, one of the mechanics will do the belts for us"
NXdc3hxH6gw,312060,313350,"because there's quite a few points,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,313350,315180,I think there's like four clipping points.
NXdc3hxH6gw,315180,320160,"But then I like to do the last part, tighten them up."
NXdc3hxH6gw,320160,322140,So the shoulders I'll do myself
NXdc3hxH6gw,322140,324160,just to a level where I'm comfortable.
NXdc3hxH6gw,324160,326750,I do like them pretty tight because once we start
NXdc3hxH6gw,326750,327618,"going on track,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,327618,330620,"once you start pulling three, four, five GS,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,330620,331453,"you'll move,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,331453,332370,you'll think the belts are tight
NXdc3hxH6gw,332370,334000,but you're still gonna move.
NXdc3hxH6gw,334000,336230,I like to give them a good good yank.
NXdc3hxH6gw,336230,337693,All right. Twitter.
NXdc3hxH6gw,338700,340980,Has a single person enjoyed drinking
NXdc3hxH6gw,340980,342700,from Daniel Ricciardo's shoe?
NXdc3hxH6gw,342700,345960,"According to these photos,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,345960,347150,"no,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,347150,348830,they most certainly have not.
NXdc3hxH6gw,348830,350720,I think they're proud after the fact.
NXdc3hxH6gw,350720,353630,"Over the years I have certainly made it a thing,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,353630,355160,the shoey on the podium.
NXdc3hxH6gw,355160,358090,"I know if I was involved in it, if it wasn't my thing,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,358090,361520,"I'd be like, this is quite cool, it's fun story to tell."
NXdc3hxH6gw,361520,364069,"But I think in the moment, it's tough"
NXdc3hxH6gw,364070,368340,because I've raced 90 minutes in this boot.
NXdc3hxH6gw,368340,370360,And it's pretty hot especially where our feet are
NXdc3hxH6gw,370360,371193,"in the car,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,371193,372520,there's no ventilation or anything.
NXdc3hxH6gw,372520,374530,"So there's definitely a lot of sweat,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,374530,375920,and it's kind of gross.
NXdc3hxH6gw,375920,378630,"So, I get it that they don't enjoy the moment"
NXdc3hxH6gw,378630,379990,but I think they enjoy the story.
NXdc3hxH6gw,379990,381830,It's one for the grandkids.
NXdc3hxH6gw,381830,383479,Getting a podium in F1 is a big deal
NXdc3hxH6gw,383480,385500,and it should be something that's celebrated.
NXdc3hxH6gw,385500,388600,I didn't always feel like people celebrated it very well.
NXdc3hxH6gw,388600,390290,Sometimes it was a little like stiff.
NXdc3hxH6gw,390290,391123,I wanna shake it up.
NXdc3hxH6gw,391123,392120,I wanna have some fun with it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,392120,394260,"I was like, I'm either gonna get booed or cheered."
NXdc3hxH6gw,394260,395613,"Fortunately, I got cheered."
NXdc3hxH6gw,396550,399180,This was one of the greatest days of my life.
NXdc3hxH6gw,399180,401060,It's the last corner in Monaco.
NXdc3hxH6gw,401060,403210,"This was me about to win the race,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,403210,405080,"so this was last corner, last lap."
NXdc3hxH6gw,405080,408659,Can we talk about how much of a madman Daniel Ricciardo is?
NXdc3hxH6gw,408660,412260,Bro took the final corner of 2018 Monaco Grand Prix
NXdc3hxH6gw,412260,415230,with one hand on the wheel and putting his other hand up
NXdc3hxH6gw,415230,416250,in the sky.
NXdc3hxH6gw,416250,417920,I'm fucking nuts I guess.
NXdc3hxH6gw,417920,419670,I am mad.
NXdc3hxH6gw,419670,421130,I am a psychopath.
NXdc3hxH6gw,421130,422720,"Obviously you watch other sports,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,422720,425190,and any top athlete in their given sport
NXdc3hxH6gw,425190,426260,can do something crazy.
NXdc3hxH6gw,426260,428400,"You're like mind blown, how do they do that?"
NXdc3hxH6gw,428400,430979,"But for them, it's probably not that crazy."
NXdc3hxH6gw,430980,433960,"So for me, this is not that crazy."
NXdc3hxH6gw,433960,435780,"When reading the comment, I'm like actually, yeah,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,435780,436850,it is kind of crazy.
NXdc3hxH6gw,436850,439600,"But in the moment, I was fully in control"
NXdc3hxH6gw,439600,442460,when I could see the finish line on this day.
NXdc3hxH6gw,442460,446449,I was kind of so ecstatic and so overwhelmed with joy
NXdc3hxH6gw,446450,449410,"that it wasn't even about me being cocky or anything,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,449410,451780,it was just about me literally going through
NXdc3hxH6gw,451780,454440,the greatest moment in my sporting life.
NXdc3hxH6gw,454440,456160,I couldn't celebrate soon enough.
NXdc3hxH6gw,456160,457220,Next one.
NXdc3hxH6gw,457220,460940,Why TF is Daniel Ricciardo joking about retiring?
NXdc3hxH6gw,460940,464070,He's literally the only reason I watch this sport.
NXdc3hxH6gw,464070,465990,"I also like how it's been worded,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,465990,467870,"like kind of aggressive at me,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,467870,469760,but then it's also really sweet.
NXdc3hxH6gw,469760,472210,"If I was seriously thinking about retiring,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,472210,473110,it's stuff like this
NXdc3hxH6gw,473110,475030,which would really make me second guess it
NXdc3hxH6gw,475030,476064,"because I'm like, man,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,476064,477797,obviously I do it for me
NXdc3hxH6gw,477797,480100,and I do it because I believe I can still do it
NXdc3hxH6gw,480100,482020,"at the best and the highest level,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,482020,486139,but I also can have a positive effect on other people
NXdc3hxH6gw,486140,488920,and really give them something to be excited for.
NXdc3hxH6gw,488920,491400,So this sort of stuff definitely makes me
NXdc3hxH6gw,491400,492440,want to do it longer.
NXdc3hxH6gw,492440,494230,So that's actually really cool.
NXdc3hxH6gw,494230,495290,Replied.
NXdc3hxH6gw,495290,498290,Do F1 drivers go to the toilet in their suits
NXdc3hxH6gw,498290,500750,and how do they drink water during a race?
NXdc3hxH6gw,500750,503490,"Louis Hamilton claims he has never done it,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,503490,505449,"while Daniel Ricciardo admits,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,505450,507630,every little curb you hit hurts.
NXdc3hxH6gw,507630,511217,I've never gone to the toilet in my suit whilst driving.
NXdc3hxH6gw,511217,513840,"And by the toilet, we're talking about number ones,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,513840,515490,we're not talking about number twos here.
NXdc3hxH6gw,515490,517800,That's just ridiculous.
NXdc3hxH6gw,517800,519940,The very last thing we do or try to do
NXdc3hxH6gw,519940,520900,before we get into the car
NXdc3hxH6gw,520900,521909,is go to the bathroom
NXdc3hxH6gw,521909,524540,because we're sat down in the car for 90 minutes or so.
NXdc3hxH6gw,524540,526190,So you obviously don't have a chance.
NXdc3hxH6gw,526190,529240,You're normally pretty good but there is times certainly
NXdc3hxH6gw,529240,531160,where you have an urge.
NXdc3hxH6gw,531160,533629,But I don't think I could physically do it
NXdc3hxH6gw,533630,535630,because we're also strapped in really tight
NXdc3hxH6gw,535630,537010,and we're really compressed.
NXdc3hxH6gw,537010,540930,We all know that you kind of need to relax to be able to go.
NXdc3hxH6gw,540930,542820,Also when you're driving at the speeds we do
NXdc3hxH6gw,542820,544700,"under the forces we're under,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,544700,547660,"I just feel it would be very, very, very hard to relax"
NXdc3hxH6gw,547660,548670,and be able to do it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,548670,550010,"So, at least I can't,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,550010,551280,"and also, I don't really want to"
NXdc3hxH6gw,551280,552610,out of respect for the mechanics
NXdc3hxH6gw,552610,554800,that are then gonna clean my car after the race.
NXdc3hxH6gw,554800,556830,"And when I say every little curb hurts,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,556830,558660,"yeah, you know if you have to go,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,558660,560970,"any little bump or vibration or shake,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,560970,561990,it stings.
NXdc3hxH6gw,561990,564500,And then how do we drink during a race?
NXdc3hxH6gw,564500,567780,"So we have basically a pack,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,567780,570210,and that'll have a drinks tube coming through it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,570210,571470,It'll connect to our helmet.
NXdc3hxH6gw,571470,573779,And then we have a tube running like under
NXdc3hxH6gw,573780,574730,through the helmet.
NXdc3hxH6gw,574730,576690,I'll have like a straw that sits
NXdc3hxH6gw,576690,579160,just to the side of my mouth during the race.
NXdc3hxH6gw,579160,580269,"And then when I want to drink,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,580270,582060,"I'll just reach my hand up,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,582060,584170,"normally on a straight where you have a few seconds,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,584170,585269,"I'll reach my hand up,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,585270,588980,"flick the straw in my mouth, get a few gulps,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,588980,590510,"flick it back out of my mouth,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,590510,592740,and then get going again.
NXdc3hxH6gw,592740,594000,"By saying get going again,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,594000,596620,Continue to be going.

NXdc3hxH6gw,597514,600380,[upbeat music]
NXdc3hxH6gw,600380,603930,"LOL, why are the drivers always so funnily awkward"
NXdc3hxH6gw,603930,606000,in these group press interviews?
NXdc3hxH6gw,606000,608030,"I think we do so many interviews,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,608030,609360,"we do so much media,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,609360,612440,you end up becoming a little bit sometimes delirious.
NXdc3hxH6gw,612440,613750,"Especially when you're with your teammate,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,613750,617620,you know that there's bigger fish to fry on that weekend.
NXdc3hxH6gw,617620,619460,We're probably getting ready to go out soon
NXdc3hxH6gw,619460,621050,for like a qualifying session or something.
NXdc3hxH6gw,621050,623750,"So you end up trying to just have a bit of fun with it,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,623750,625150,and sometimes being a bit silly.
NXdc3hxH6gw,625150,626260,"Because we do do so many,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,626260,628880,"I think if you let them get to you,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,628880,631110,then you're gonna kind of be miserable.
NXdc3hxH6gw,631110,634140,"So yeah, you just give each other a bit of banter,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,634140,635700,"kind of poke at each other a little bit,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,635700,636610,have a bit of fun.
NXdc3hxH6gw,636610,639342,And it does sometimes come across as very awkward.
NXdc3hxH6gw,640450,641483,Next.
NXdc3hxH6gw,641483,643930,[upbeat music]
NXdc3hxH6gw,643930,645710,I love how Drive to Survive
NXdc3hxH6gw,645710,647840,made it seem as though there was tension
NXdc3hxH6gw,647840,649630,between Lando and Danny Ric.
NXdc3hxH6gw,649630,652670,They overdramatized a season that was dramatic enough
NXdc3hxH6gw,652670,654430,on its own. LOL.
NXdc3hxH6gw,654430,658310,"Drive to Survive, especially the 2021 season,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,658310,660000,was a crazy season in F1.
NXdc3hxH6gw,660000,662550,"There was a lot of authentic drama,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,662550,664250,"a lot of chaos, a lot of stuff going on."
NXdc3hxH6gw,664250,667030,"I think Drive to Survive, certainly ran with that,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,667030,669550,and at times probably sprinkled a little bit more on top.
NXdc3hxH6gw,669550,672490,"So there was a rivalry between myself and Lando,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,672490,674080,which wasn't really there.
NXdc3hxH6gw,674080,675820,"I think it was just, I was new to the team,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,675820,677940,so it was the first time we'd worked together.
NXdc3hxH6gw,677940,680610,"So it's us trying to kind of establish a relationship,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,680610,682230,I guess figure each other out.
NXdc3hxH6gw,682230,685130,"So for sure, from day one, we're not compatible"
NXdc3hxH6gw,685130,687486,or best friends out of the box.
NXdc3hxH6gw,687486,689660,That kind of thing took a bit of time.
NXdc3hxH6gw,689660,691670,"The show added a bit of spice to that,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,691670,693410,but there wasn't any spice.
NXdc3hxH6gw,693410,698410,"We're competitive but there wasn't any spice, I guess."
NXdc3hxH6gw,699210,700370,Wikipedia.
NXdc3hxH6gw,700370,702105,There's a lot of outlets.
NXdc3hxH6gw,702105,704550,I kind of forgot all these existed.
NXdc3hxH6gw,704550,705959,"All right, Wikipedia."
NXdc3hxH6gw,705960,708660,He is often referred to as the honey Badger
NXdc3hxH6gw,708660,710420,"referencing his racing style,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,710420,712459,explaining how it's supposed to be
NXdc3hxH6gw,712460,714950,the most fearless animal in the animal kingdom.
NXdc3hxH6gw,714950,717630,"When you look at it, he seems quite cute and cuddly,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,717630,719890,but as soon as someone crosses his territory
NXdc3hxH6gw,719890,721390,"in a way he doesn't like,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,721390,723210,"he turns into a bit of a savage,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,723210,724850,"and he'll go after anything,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,724850,726209,"tigers, pythons."
NXdc3hxH6gw,726210,728480,"He turns very quickly, but he's a good guy."
NXdc3hxH6gw,728480,729600,I guess that's my quote.
NXdc3hxH6gw,729600,732440,"So yeah, my nickname is the Honey Badger."
NXdc3hxH6gw,732440,735820,I don't think people always took me that seriously
NXdc3hxH6gw,735820,738470,and kind of respected my competitive side.
NXdc3hxH6gw,738470,741060,"But deep down, I know how much of a competitor I am,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,741060,743680,and I know that I can like get my teeth stuck in.
NXdc3hxH6gw,743680,745526,I needed to let this come out
NXdc3hxH6gw,745526,748130,"to really establish myself in Formula 1,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,748130,752210,and to turn a little bit of my easygoing reputation around.
NXdc3hxH6gw,752210,755800,"I kept the kind of the cool, easygoing, demeanor off track,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,755800,759070,"but on track, I was being talked about the most"
NXdc3hxH6gw,759070,760830,kind of aggressive over taker
NXdc3hxH6gw,760830,763210,"and the guy that other drivers would fear,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,763210,764340,all this sort of stuff.
NXdc3hxH6gw,764340,768170,That was really cool for me to be able to execute
NXdc3hxH6gw,768170,769430,"because I knew I had it in me,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,769430,772120,"but yeah, letting it out benefited me tremendously"
NXdc3hxH6gw,772120,772953,in my career.
NXdc3hxH6gw,774440,775520,Reddit.
NXdc3hxH6gw,775520,777710,"If Daniel Ricciardo came to NASCAR,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,777710,779650,how do you see it playing out if he did?
NXdc3hxH6gw,779650,780970,I am a fan of NASCAR.
NXdc3hxH6gw,780970,781870,I love motor sport.
NXdc3hxH6gw,781870,783580,I grew up watching NASCAR for sure.
NXdc3hxH6gw,783580,786850,It's something which I'll definitely like to try one day.
NXdc3hxH6gw,786850,788800,"I don't know if I would just jump in a NASCAR and be like,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,788800,790360,"yeah, I wanna race this weekend"
NXdc3hxH6gw,790360,792779,with the guys that have been doing it their whole life
NXdc3hxH6gw,792780,795150,and are perfectionists at that discipline
NXdc3hxH6gw,795150,797040,I wouldn't wanna humiliate myself.
NXdc3hxH6gw,797040,799720,I would certainly like to drive a car competitively
NXdc3hxH6gw,799720,801579,but maybe like in a test session or something.
NXdc3hxH6gw,801580,803850,"But the truth is, unless I did a lot of testing"
NXdc3hxH6gw,803850,804750,"and preparation,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,804750,806370,I'd probably get my ass handed to me.
NXdc3hxH6gw,806370,807683,So I don't need that.
NXdc3hxH6gw,808530,809820,This was Top Gear.
NXdc3hxH6gw,811100,813610,Didn't he beat Hamilton's time in the same car.
NXdc3hxH6gw,813610,814700,The answer is yes.
NXdc3hxH6gw,814700,817270,"I broke the record for this lap time,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,817270,818520,this segment in the show.
NXdc3hxH6gw,818520,820680,"I believe it was a fairly long standing record,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,820680,822620,I think Hamilton had it for a few years.
NXdc3hxH6gw,822620,823990,"And it was actually a big moment,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,823990,825000,I was really proud.
NXdc3hxH6gw,825000,827310,Then the show discontinued.
NXdc3hxH6gw,827310,831350,I believe at least I'm the all time winner
NXdc3hxH6gw,831350,834470,"who cannot be beat, and I'm proud."
NXdc3hxH6gw,834470,836269,"If I never win an F1 world title,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,836270,837610,I have this.
NXdc3hxH6gw,837610,838529,Posted.
NXdc3hxH6gw,838530,839400,"Fun fact,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,839400,841650,So not only did Daniel Ricciardo get credit
NXdc3hxH6gw,841650,844340,"as the percussionist on The Man Himself,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,844340,847420,but he also got a shout out in Goal of the Century
NXdc3hxH6gw,847420,849339,on the Gang of Youth's new album.
NXdc3hxH6gw,849340,850220,This is so cool.
NXdc3hxH6gw,850220,854009,"So it's the rabbits are chasing, Ricciardo is racing."
NXdc3hxH6gw,854010,855070,I love music.
NXdc3hxH6gw,855070,855910,I don't play.
NXdc3hxH6gw,855910,859459,"I'm not a musicianist, or a musician, a musicianist,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,859460,860750,I'm not a musician.
NXdc3hxH6gw,860750,862990,Music really speaks to me.
NXdc3hxH6gw,862990,865880,"There is something inside me, which yeah,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,865880,867740,just relates tremendously to music.
NXdc3hxH6gw,867740,870140,Gang of Youths is an Australian band
NXdc3hxH6gw,870140,872460,"who I got to know over the last few years,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,872460,873990,and I'm a big fan of them.
NXdc3hxH6gw,873990,875660,"The lead singer, Dave,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,875660,878220,"when they were making the new album was like, oh,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,878220,880040,I'm gonna give you a shout out in the album.
NXdc3hxH6gw,880040,881519,"And I was kind of like, oh yeah,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,881520,882940,I didn't think much of it.
NXdc3hxH6gw,882940,884790,"And then when they finished the album,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,884790,888009,he sent me a link to it before it got released.
NXdc3hxH6gw,888010,890460,"He goes, check out the last song on the album."
NXdc3hxH6gw,890460,891830,And it's quite a long song.
NXdc3hxH6gw,891830,893510,"And it gets to about the sixth minute,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,893510,895710,"and I hear the line, Ricciardo is racing."
NXdc3hxH6gw,895710,899060,"And I was, even now I'm like,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,899060,901550,it's such a big deal for me.
NXdc3hxH6gw,901550,903820,"Off track, one of my most proud moments"
NXdc3hxH6gw,903820,906450,is to be shouted out in a song.
NXdc3hxH6gw,906450,908440,"Another song on the album, The Man Himself."
NXdc3hxH6gw,908440,911230,"So yeah, we did percussion."
NXdc3hxH6gw,911230,912990,"We went to watch them record,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,912990,915670,"two friends and actually people I work with,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,915670,917649,we went to watch them record in studio.
NXdc3hxH6gw,917650,919700,"And then it was kind of like,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,919700,921040,do you just want to be on the album?
NXdc3hxH6gw,921040,924279,"We're like, we can't play, we suck."
NXdc3hxH6gw,924280,927040,"And they talked us through it, and eventually,"
NXdc3hxH6gw,927040,930589,we made enough noise that it was worthy of the album.
NXdc3hxH6gw,930590,934640,It's in kind of the opening sequence of The Man Himself.
NXdc3hxH6gw,934640,936940,Just living all my dreams right now.
NXdc3hxH6gw,936940,939533,"Okay, that's it, signing off the internet."
