awQ6sqf5E3Q,28195,31092,Before starting the rule I will clear some basic things
awQ6sqf5E3Q,31092,32280,what types of rings are there?
awQ6sqf5E3Q,32280,36001,Look there are 3 major shapes to say
awQ6sqf5E3Q,36001,38642,The first is very simple bands
awQ6sqf5E3Q,38642,43286,The band means the same exact cylindrical shape that is getting wrapped on your finger.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,43286,44931,There is nothing different in this
awQ6sqf5E3Q,44931,46239,No weird patterns
awQ6sqf5E3Q,46240,49467,Just a simple rings means metal
awQ6sqf5E3Q,49467,51348,The second type of ring is a Signet ring
awQ6sqf5E3Q,51348,53708,Now the best example of signet ring is
awQ6sqf5E3Q,53708,59001,The astrology type ring which your grandfathers used to wear
awQ6sqf5E3Q,59001,62864,"Now those ones used to be metal rings, they used to have a pearl on it."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,62864,63467,Weird
awQ6sqf5E3Q,63467,67384,But nowadays you can believe in some geometrical in the signet rings.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,67384,69058,which is basically a round ring
awQ6sqf5E3Q,69058,71417,But its upper part is like a geometrical shape
awQ6sqf5E3Q,71417,73550,And the third type of rings are chunky rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,73550,76773,The different types of rings on which dragons are made or MATA RANI is made
awQ6sqf5E3Q,76773,77687,This means anything is made
awQ6sqf5E3Q,77687,80157,"Now the second point, in which material do these rings come?"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,80157,81722,Now look it comes in a lot of material
awQ6sqf5E3Q,81722,83252,but I will tell you about basics
awQ6sqf5E3Q,83252,87505,Now your ring can be directly be of a metal like stainless steel
awQ6sqf5E3Q,87505,90316,Or it can be or silver or gold
awQ6sqf5E3Q,90317,94948,now you know about its colours but some also come in blue colour
awQ6sqf5E3Q,94948,98516,In metal now what they do is they just put colour on the metal rings.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,98516,100476,Now there is another material whose rings come
awQ6sqf5E3Q,100476,103228,Sometimes it's better because it's lightweight
awQ6sqf5E3Q,103228,105647,It feels less heavy on your fingers that is silicon
awQ6sqf5E3Q,105648,108620,Silicon ring doesn't have that shine in their rings but sometimes you don't need that shine
awQ6sqf5E3Q,108620,110678,when you are wearing something basic causal
awQ6sqf5E3Q,110678,114103,The best thing of this silicon ring is your fingers will never be pulled
awQ6sqf5E3Q,114103,117046,Metal rings can sometimes get pulled by getting stuck in fingers.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,117046,119645,Now let's come to the important rules of wearing rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,119645,121065,Rule number 1 Less is more
awQ6sqf5E3Q,121066,124208,"Basically, you will look takky by wearing a lot of rings"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,124208,126846,And you do not want to wear it less because it will not be fun
awQ6sqf5E3Q,126846,131669,"According to me, the sweet spot is, to wear 2 rings in both your hands."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,131669,134436,"Now doing more than this is too much, according to me"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,134436,137074,Let me tell you I have worn more than this but
awQ6sqf5E3Q,137074,142199,I just wear that in a street style event in a city like Delhi
awQ6sqf5E3Q,142199,145142,Guys see some events happen is cities like Delhi and Mumbai
awQ6sqf5E3Q,145142,146868,Where all these things look cool
awQ6sqf5E3Q,146868,150025,To be honest outside that event you will somewhat look like yo yo boy.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,150025,154152,One more important point of this you have to balance rings in your both hands
awQ6sqf5E3Q,154152,157002,"This doesn't mean on 1 hand you are wearing 4 and on another hand, you are wearing 0."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,157003,158696,Or on one hand 3 and another hand 1.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,158696,159196,NO
awQ6sqf5E3Q,159196,161086,The difference between the two should be at most 1.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,161086,163854,This means if you are wearing 2 on one hand and 1 on another hand.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,163854,168920,By less is more also means you should not only wear chunky rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,168920,170459,If you are wearing one chunky
awQ6sqf5E3Q,170460,175676,then according to me on the same hand another ring should not be chunky it should be plain.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,175676,181415,And especially your watch hand where you are wearing watch there you are already wearing a thing seen a lot.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,181415,182340,Which is the watch
awQ6sqf5E3Q,182340,186385,That's why on that hand never wear a chunky ring
awQ6sqf5E3Q,186385,190349,One more important thing is I told you on hand only wear 2 rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,190349,192970,But don't wear both the rings on adjacent fingers
awQ6sqf5E3Q,192970,196766,This means there should be 1 free finger between 2 rings wearing fingers
awQ6sqf5E3Q,196766,198118,Give some gap and space out.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,198118,200681,Next rule is you have to match the width of your ring
awQ6sqf5E3Q,200681,202287,With your finger size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,202287,203605,And also with your hand size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,203605,206672,BAsically if your hand is small and skinny
awQ6sqf5E3Q,206673,208113,Don't wear chunky rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,208113,211713,And if you are wearing it on small finger that is on pinky finger
awQ6sqf5E3Q,211713,213875,Never wear a chunky ring on that always wear a small ring on that finger
awQ6sqf5E3Q,213876,216426,The next rule is you have to wear the ring on the right finger
awQ6sqf5E3Q,216426,218941,Now see this rule is a traditional rule
awQ6sqf5E3Q,218941,223791,Suppose you wear your wedding ring on this finger in the wedding finger.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,223791,228698,"But in today's world, if you are wearing any ring anywhere."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,228698,230341,It's just a fashion statement.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,230341,232161,Nowadays there is no meaning of rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,232161,235215,If you are wearing it on this or that finger then it means this or that
awQ6sqf5E3Q,235216,235762,it's no more
awQ6sqf5E3Q,235762,240275,Now next rule is you have to match the ring colour with your skin undertone.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,240407,241732,"Skin's undertone means,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,241732,243202,"that if you will see your veins,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,243202,244293,if your veins
awQ6sqf5E3Q,244293,245514,are slightly of bluish colour
awQ6sqf5E3Q,245514,246729,then you have a 'cool undertone'.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,246729,248595,And if your veins are of slightly greenish color
awQ6sqf5E3Q,248595,249910,them you have 'warm undertone'.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,249910,251502,"If your undertone is cool,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,251502,254035,then your skin's color has a bit bluish feel.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,254035,255464,"And if your undertone is warm,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,255464,257178,then your skin has a little yellowish feel.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,257178,259204,That means if you have a cool undertone.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,259204,261844,"then if you wear silver-colored accessories, then it will look better."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,261844,263013,"And if you have a warm undertone,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,263013,265085,"then if you will wear gold-colored accessories, it will look better."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,265085,267474,"The next rule is that, you have to match your rings"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,267474,269377,with your remaining accessories.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,269377,270979,"I mean, if your watch is of silver color,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,270979,273127,then your rings should be of silver color as well.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,273127,276902,"Or your bracelet, say it, is of black color,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,276902,279300,then your rings should be of black color as well.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,279300,282629,"From this, it is understood that you have used your mind while choosing accessories."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,282629,284881,Everything looks coherent and goes along.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,284881,288664,"The next is that you have to match your accessories with your outfit,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,288664,291041,because your outfit decides your occasion.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,291041,292258,That is where you are going after wearing it.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,292259,292946,"And with what purpose, you are wearing it."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,292946,295516,"Now, I will not go wearing chunky rings in the college every day."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,295516,297423,I will go wearing plain band rings.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,297423,299442,"So, that I don't have to think much in the college,"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,299442,301697,that this is fashion stuff.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,301697,304052,"It will be problematic while writing, if the rings would be chunky."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,304053,307171,"But of course, if I am going to an event, where I have to look very cool"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,307224,309017,Then I will go for more rings for sure
awQ6sqf5E3Q,309017,312226,Then my outfit will also be like crazy street style but
awQ6sqf5E3Q,312226,317029,If I'm going to college and I'm wearing a polo and chinos
awQ6sqf5E3Q,317029,318245,Or suppose I'm going to the office
awQ6sqf5E3Q,318245,320079,There I will not wear a lot of rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,320079,323486,The next very important thing is you have to wear the ring of the proper size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,323486,327931,"What do a lot of people do, they take a big ring because they don't know how to get the right size ring."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,327931,331011,And then he becomes loose on his finger and it falls while walking.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,331011,333970,And if you take it too tight then your blood flow will stop in the finger
awQ6sqf5E3Q,333971,336840,See there is a basic way of measuring ring size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,336840,337837,The easiest way is
awQ6sqf5E3Q,337837,341822,Take an inch take and then wrap it on the finger on which you have to wear ring.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,341822,343332,And then note what the size is
awQ6sqf5E3Q,343332,348086,Whenever you buy the ring online it will be written according to your ring size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,348086,350227,what is the meaning of whatever centimeter?
awQ6sqf5E3Q,350227,354725,Like say X centimeter is your finger size means 11 size
awQ6sqf5E3Q,354726,356166,Then accordingly you will be able to get the right ring
awQ6sqf5E3Q,356166,360503,"Next, there is one more rule it is funny but actually, it is like that"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,360503,363636,Man if you want to make your fingers look cool by wearing rings
awQ6sqf5E3Q,363636,367633,The hair which is below the ring should not be too long
awQ6sqf5E3Q,367633,368475,trim them a bit
awQ6sqf5E3Q,368475,372205,"Otherwise, the hair which will come out from the middle of the ring, then it is going to spoil your look."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,372205,377892,And the last rule is if you want to wear rings then wear fewer rings but wear them confidently
awQ6sqf5E3Q,377892,380169,On the first day if you will wear a lot of chunky rings on the first day then you won't be confident
awQ6sqf5E3Q,380169,381320,I feel this and this can happen
awQ6sqf5E3Q,381320,384029,But if you will start with plain ring then you will build confidence slowly
awQ6sqf5E3Q,384029,386983,"And confidence is very important while wearing rings otherwise, all your looks will look bad."
awQ6sqf5E3Q,386983,389366,Now let's come on from where will you buy these rings on budget
awQ6sqf5E3Q,389366,395819,Now honestly the best way of buying chunky rings is buy it from the local market
awQ6sqf5E3Q,395819,398526,"In Delhi, you will get it in Janpath market and also in Palika Bazar"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,398526,402017,"And I think you will also get it in the Sarojini market and In Mumbai, you will get it in Colaba"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,402017,403761,You will get in all such types of places
awQ6sqf5E3Q,403761,409494,If you know a nearby shop where you will get all these accessories
awQ6sqf5E3Q,409494,414008,So help your other bros in telling nearby stores in your area

awQ6sqf5E3Q,419525,423988,"According to me, you should invest a good amount in basic rings"
awQ6sqf5E3Q,423989,429704,Like you shouldn't get absolutely steel bands. If you will buy silver then its shine will be long lasting
awQ6sqf5E3Q,429704,430875,later you can also sell it.
awQ6sqf5E3Q,430875,433943,But keeping everyone's budget in mind I will put the best links in the description
