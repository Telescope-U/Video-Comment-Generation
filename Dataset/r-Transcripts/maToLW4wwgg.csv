maToLW4wwgg,24320,26880,welcome to the toyota land cruiser 300
maToLW4wwgg,26880,30560,series gr sport this is the first gr
maToLW4wwgg,30560,32480,sport version of the land cruiser
maToLW4wwgg,32480,34480,nameplate it is the most off-road
maToLW4wwgg,34480,37200,capable variant in the new lineup in
maToLW4wwgg,37200,39600,terms of design the exterior is dressed
maToLW4wwgg,39600,41360,in a unique black front grille and
maToLW4wwgg,41360,43600,bumper bar a special scuff plate
maToLW4wwgg,43600,44559,underneath
maToLW4wwgg,44559,46960,and black wheel arch moulds the side
maToLW4wwgg,46960,49360,mirrors window surrounds and door
maToLW4wwgg,49360,51680,handles are also in black the rear
maToLW4wwgg,51680,53760,departure angle is the same as any other
maToLW4wwgg,53760,56960,variant rated at 25 degrees while the
maToLW4wwgg,56960,59840,front approach angle is 32 degrees like
maToLW4wwgg,59840,63520,all variants except the top zx sahara
maToLW4wwgg,63520,65280,this is all according to the australian
maToLW4wwgg,65280,67280,specifications anyway
maToLW4wwgg,67280,70320,underneath you'll find the tnga f body
maToLW4wwgg,70320,73040,on frame platform it's suspended by a
maToLW4wwgg,73040,76080,world first electronic kinetic dynamic
maToLW4wwgg,76080,78320,suspension system providing quick
maToLW4wwgg,78320,79759,locking and unlocking of these
maToLW4wwgg,79759,82640,stabilizer bars this is unique to the gr
maToLW4wwgg,82640,85280,sport variant the gr also comes with
maToLW4wwgg,85280,87119,front center and rear locking
maToLW4wwgg,87119,88479,differentials
maToLW4wwgg,88479,90640,basically if you get stuck in this
maToLW4wwgg,90640,92400,you've definitely gone too far off the
maToLW4wwgg,92400,93920,beaten track and you should probably
maToLW4wwgg,93920,97040,turn around when you can
maToLW4wwgg,97040,99680,inside the gr sport comes in five seat
maToLW4wwgg,99680,101520,configuration only
maToLW4wwgg,101520,103280,front passengers are treated to special
maToLW4wwgg,103280,105840,gr seats while the dash and overall
maToLW4wwgg,105840,107920,cabin theme is a blend of luxury and
maToLW4wwgg,107920,110000,sportiness there's a heap of driving
maToLW4wwgg,110000,112159,modes and controls to play around with
maToLW4wwgg,112159,115040,and the new 12.3 inch touchscreen it
maToLW4wwgg,115040,117119,packs in loads of apps and is pretty
maToLW4wwgg,117119,119280,easy to navigate the driver views a
maToLW4wwgg,119280,120880,7-inch digital screen for the trip
maToLW4wwgg,120880,123119,information but we like the way analog
maToLW4wwgg,123119,125040,dials remain as well
maToLW4wwgg,125040,127200,within the big chunky center console is
maToLW4wwgg,127200,130080,a powered cooler box inside and you can
maToLW4wwgg,130080,131760,switch it off to use it for general
maToLW4wwgg,131760,134319,storage the driving position is great
maToLW4wwgg,134319,136560,with lots of adjustment available and
maToLW4wwgg,136560,138560,overall headroom and legroom levels are
maToLW4wwgg,138560,141120,not going to be an issue for most people
maToLW4wwgg,141120,144319,likewise the rear seat area is massive
maToLW4wwgg,144319,146319,the rear bench reclines as well for
maToLW4wwgg,146319,148879,added comfort and you have separate dual
maToLW4wwgg,148879,150879,zone climate control with vents in the
maToLW4wwgg,150879,152319,ceiling and the back of the center
maToLW4wwgg,152319,153440,console
maToLW4wwgg,153440,156000,as well as heated and cooled outer seats
maToLW4wwgg,156000,158319,and three charging options
maToLW4wwgg,158319,160640,basically this cabin is perfectly set up
maToLW4wwgg,160640,163680,for a big family trip around australia
maToLW4wwgg,163680,166000,there's even a 14 speaker jbl sound
maToLW4wwgg,166000,167920,system to drown out any whinging
maToLW4wwgg,167920,169200,passengers
maToLW4wwgg,169200,170720,without the third row of seats in the
maToLW4wwgg,170720,173680,back the boot area is just mega
maToLW4wwgg,173680,176800,there's 1 131 litres to utilize in the
maToLW4wwgg,176800,180640,default layout or up to 2052 litres with
maToLW4wwgg,180640,183360,the second row folded this test car also
maToLW4wwgg,183360,185519,shows off the towing kit and roof racks
maToLW4wwgg,185519,188080,available as an official accessory the
maToLW4wwgg,188080,190159,spare tyre remains under the car at the
maToLW4wwgg,190159,191200,back
maToLW4wwgg,191200,192879,no changes are made under the bonnet
maToLW4wwgg,192879,195040,specific to the gr sport
maToLW4wwgg,195040,197920,it retains the new 3.3 liter twin turbo
maToLW4wwgg,197920,200239,diesel v6 as all other variants in
maToLW4wwgg,200239,202720,australia this is a great engine in our
maToLW4wwgg,202720,205040,opinion offering lots more power and
maToLW4wwgg,205040,208720,torque than the old 4.5 v8 diesel
maToLW4wwgg,208720,210239,it's matched to a permanent 4-wheel
maToLW4wwgg,210239,212239,drive system after going through a
maToLW4wwgg,212239,214959,10-speed auto performance is more than
maToLW4wwgg,214959,217040,adequate for this style of vehicle and
maToLW4wwgg,217040,219360,in fact according to our tests it is
maToLW4wwgg,219360,221519,about one second quicker to 100 compared
maToLW4wwgg,221519,224400,with the diesel 200 series although the
maToLW4wwgg,224400,226239,quickest time we've seen from the 300
maToLW4wwgg,226239,228879,series is in the base model gx
maToLW4wwgg,228879,231200,likely because it is lighter
maToLW4wwgg,231200,233120,obviously acceleration is not this
maToLW4wwgg,233120,235840,vehicle's main focus the land cruiser is
maToLW4wwgg,235840,238720,all about conquering terrain and we can
maToLW4wwgg,238720,241280,confirm it performs brilliantly in the
maToLW4wwgg,241280,243599,mucky stuff we didn't reach the outer
maToLW4wwgg,243599,245760,limits of its capability but with the
maToLW4wwgg,245760,248080,kinetic suspension system engaged the
maToLW4wwgg,248080,250159,amount of wheel travel and flex is
maToLW4wwgg,250159,253040,outstanding especially for such a big
maToLW4wwgg,253040,254879,comfortable suv
maToLW4wwgg,254879,256639,the all-terrain tyres might not look
maToLW4wwgg,256639,258959,that impressive but grip levels are also
maToLW4wwgg,258959,261440,really good even in sticky mud
maToLW4wwgg,261440,263199,overall though you just get the sense
maToLW4wwgg,263199,264960,this machine will forge through or
maToLW4wwgg,264960,267360,clamber over pretty much anything
maToLW4wwgg,267360,269520,ground clearance is rated at 235
maToLW4wwgg,269520,272720,millimeters and you have dirt sand mud
maToLW4wwgg,272720,275120,deep snow and rock driving modes to
maToLW4wwgg,275120,277840,further optimize its abilities
maToLW4wwgg,277840,280960,there is a sport s and sport s plus mode
maToLW4wwgg,280960,284080,to optimize on-road performance as well
maToLW4wwgg,284080,288039,this is what it goes like
