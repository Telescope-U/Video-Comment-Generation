_JA5sQVGal4,80,8160,for the next 72 hours we are going to be  stranded on this deserted island off the  coast of panama with no food our only
_JA5sQVGal4,8160,13280,bone hook is stuck on a rock no water  and only one item each i don't think
_JA5sQVGal4,13280,19600,i've slept at all i grew up watching  survival shows you're stuck out here  with no water source at all it's
_JA5sQVGal4,19600,25760,actually drink the fluid from a fresh  elephant down so if i'm being honest  this is my childhood dream come true but
_JA5sQVGal4,25760,31359,at the same time the realities of how  challenging and how uncomfortable this  is going to be
_JA5sQVGal4,31359,37120,we're already setting it  if you missed our last video we've just
_JA5sQVGal4,37120,43840,spent the last three days learning  survival skills from the experts it is  the world's most poisonous tree now the
_JA5sQVGal4,43840,50480,challenge is to take what we've learned  and see if we can put it to use in a  real life survival situation this little
_JA5sQVGal4,50480,56640,shady patch of sand is going to be our  home for the next 72 hours we have four  people participating in this challenge
_JA5sQVGal4,56640,62640,and for my one item i have chosen to  bring a fishing kit but to make this  even more of a challenge for no reason
_JA5sQVGal4,62640,68960,we are not going to allow ourselves to  use this kit until the last 36 hours of  the challenge the first 36 hours we will
_JA5sQVGal4,68960,75520,attempt to catch fish just by primitive  means i'm dusty nate's brother and i  decided to bring machete i'm sarah
_JA5sQVGal4,75520,81600,dusty's wife and i brought a knife and  last but not least i chose to bring
_JA5sQVGal4,81600,87920,coffee i already can't wait to drink my  morning coffee out of my coconut that i  carved out myself i know most people
_JA5sQVGal4,87920,94159,wouldn't consider this a survival  necessity but if i'm gonna be productive  at all to this group i need this and i'm
_JA5sQVGal4,94159,100159,gonna share  and in addition to our one man-made item  each we have a few other things that
_JA5sQVGal4,100159,107040,we've brought along all these things we  have made with our own hands during the  last three days as we've been learning  survival skills this is a pot for
_JA5sQVGal4,107040,113040,cooking we have some coconut bowls for  eating and drinking out of and most  importantly is our bow drill kit this is
_JA5sQVGal4,113040,120159,what we will use to attempt to start  fire  this is genuinely and i'm not just
_JA5sQVGal4,120159,125520,saying this one of the most ambitious  attempts to do this final three days so  just to be clear whenever someone signs
_JA5sQVGal4,125520,130720,up to do this survival challenge with  tom he's kind enough to let them take  all sorts of goodies with him to make
_JA5sQVGal4,130720,137599,things more comfortable  but against tom's will we refused all of  these things and only brought the items
_JA5sQVGal4,137599,143200,we just showed you so these guys i  promise you are doing this  really ridiculously hardcore they've got
_JA5sQVGal4,143200,149440,to film this thing and they're making it  very hard for themselves so they're  saying that they're not going to take in
_JA5sQVGal4,149440,155360,the flower they're saying they're not  going to take in any of these personal  hygiene items their water bottle they're  not going to take the water the head
_JA5sQVGal4,155360,161920,torch they're not gonna take the  sleeping bag liner and they're saying  that they're certainly gonna try to fish
_JA5sQVGal4,161920,167519,just using bones for at least the first  36 hours so no to the fishing kit all  right so now that you have a better
_JA5sQVGal4,167519,173280,understanding of the real situation  let's get to work yeah let's like let's  just clear this whole space oh are you
_JA5sQVGal4,173280,180720,like sleeping i love it  our top three priorities for today are  fire water and shelter if we can achieve
_JA5sQVGal4,180720,188319,those three things before the sun goes  down we will count today as a massive  success we're starting by attempting to  build a shelter
_JA5sQVGal4,188480,194080,this tree that we were planning on  building our shelter against is  literally covered in millions
_JA5sQVGal4,194080,200560,of ants i mean they seem to just be  hanging out on the tree but the idea  that they could just crawl into bed with  us very easily
_JA5sQVGal4,200560,206400,i think we stay feels like it's almost  two o'clock already and we don't have  any of our essentials done so i think we
_JA5sQVGal4,206400,213360,just gotta stick with it today  already looking fresh sarah and i are  attempting to build a mattress with all
_JA5sQVGal4,213360,220319,these dead palm leaves on the ground our  goal is to layer up as many as possible  because it's pretty much been the crab
_JA5sQVGal4,220319,226480,apocalypse each night when the sun goes  down i'm pretty nervous about it they're  everywhere wow
_JA5sQVGal4,226480,232959,during our survival training we learned  how to make a mattress out of fresh  green palm branches and this one is
_JA5sQVGal4,232959,240319,hanging so low but it's so stuck i've  been trying to pull on it forever and i  was just shaking the tree and these two
_JA5sQVGal4,240319,246640,giant  green coconuts fell from the tree but  also almost laid on sarah's head we
_JA5sQVGal4,246640,252640,learned that coconuts kill 14 times more  people than sharks every year so this is  a real safety concern did you pull any
_JA5sQVGal4,252640,258959,more down  come on down come on  anybody remember which side we're
_JA5sQVGal4,258959,264560,supposed to hit we learned last week  that these green coconuts are the most  difficult to get but they're also the
_JA5sQVGal4,264560,271520,yummiest so getting two off the tree by  accident this early in the challenge was  a pretty big deal but since we were
_JA5sQVGal4,271520,278800,still so fresh we had no idea how  grateful we should have been no kara  gets the first sip for sure
_JA5sQVGal4,278800,286000,cara got those down their bare hands  well our first  water of the trip and maybe we should
_JA5sQVGal4,286000,291840,have saved them for later instead of  chugging them right away they say you  need about 400 milliliters of water per
_JA5sQVGal4,291840,298560,day to survive to thrive no to survive  oh and i think each coconut has  somewhere around that amount so we need
_JA5sQVGal4,298560,304560,at least four coconuts a day or we're  going to be extremely uncomfortable  we were all feeling dangerously
_JA5sQVGal4,304560,310960,optimistic at this point but nate was  right we had no idea how quickly we'd  feel the effects of not eating or
_JA5sQVGal4,310960,317459,drinking anything except for the half a  coconut you just saw  [Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,320639,329360,it's definitely sad how much trash  washes up on the beach however this  giant knot of rope is extremely useful
_JA5sQVGal4,329360,334639,sarah and i are cutting little strings  like this in order to build our shelter  so while the girls work on the roof of
_JA5sQVGal4,334639,341840,the shelter dusty and i are going to  attempt to start a fire the goal  is to use this bow to spin the spindle
_JA5sQVGal4,341840,347199,fast enough inside this hole that it  gets hot enough to create an ember and
_JA5sQVGal4,347199,353199,then we will slowly and carefully move  that ember to this tinder bundle and
_JA5sQVGal4,353199,360800,blow on it until hopefully it combusts  into flames we've done this once before  and it literally took hours so wish us
_JA5sQVGal4,360800,367440,luck  but if you can drink your urine
_JA5sQVGal4,367440,370319,i think you can
_JA5sQVGal4,374479,378680,all right warmed it up alright ready
_JA5sQVGal4,392479,398160,we have a really good ember look at that  oh my gosh we're not there yet come on
_JA5sQVGal4,398160,403919,the smoke is a good sign  look at that look at that
_JA5sQVGal4,403919,412960,yes yes  oh my gosh we have fire
_JA5sQVGal4,414080,419919,oh it's terribly warm  thank goodness i was sweating so bad 20
_JA5sQVGal4,419919,425759,minutes  wow 20 minutes  that was what i was most excited about
_JA5sQVGal4,425759,431440,doing this whole trip and the fact that  we did it in 20 minutes i am on an  adrenaline high right now we were all on
_JA5sQVGal4,431440,438000,a major adrenaline high at this point  but we'd soon learn that survival is a  constant roller coaster of highs like
_JA5sQVGal4,438000,444960,this one and lows we're gonna burn down  our shelter yeah we might all that smoke  blowing into the shelter if all goes as
_JA5sQVGal4,444960,451039,planned that's gonna keep us from  getting eaten alive while we sleep  hopefully we can still breathe to be  determined real quick i want to say a
_JA5sQVGal4,451039,458000,big thank you to athletic greens for  sponsoring this video and i just wanted  to give you a little reminder of what i  look like when i've showered slept and
_JA5sQVGal4,458000,464319,eaten properly 801 by athletic grains  has been part of our daily routine for  two years and we absolutely love it
_JA5sQVGal4,464319,470160,trust me we would not keep talking about  it if we didn't it is an all-in-one  nutritional supplement and just one
_JA5sQVGal4,470160,477120,scoop contains 75 vitamins minerals  whole food source ingredients and all  sorts of other awesome things that we
_JA5sQVGal4,477120,483520,were definitely not getting from our  diet alone we seriously don't go  anywhere without it i even brought these  to the island stirring it with a stick
_JA5sQVGal4,483520,489120,because i don't think coconuts contain  magnesium vitamin a vitamin c vitamin e
_JA5sQVGal4,489120,495840,diamond riboflavin niacin vitamin b6  folate vitamin b12 and of course it's  vegan paleo keto all the things when
_JA5sQVGal4,495840,501840,we're at home or living out of the van  we keep this jar in the fridge but when  we're living out of a suitcase again
_JA5sQVGal4,501840,506879,i stuff as many of these travel packs as  i can
_JA5sQVGal4,506879,512640,in my bag so this is proof that we  really love this stuff i had to bring  enough to make sure we had some for  every single day until we go back home
_JA5sQVGal4,512640,520159,again so if you'd like to try ag-1 which  we highly recommend that you do if you  click the link below you can get the  ag-1 immunity bundle your first purchase
_JA5sQVGal4,520159,526000,will include this jar the shaker five  free travel packs and a year supply of
_JA5sQVGal4,526000,531040,these vitamin d drop they help support  your immunity and nate and i also take  these every day i promise you won't
_JA5sQVGal4,531040,535839,regret it all right back to the video
_JA5sQVGal4,536080,543509,we're going on a celebratory swim  [Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,545200,551920,this is so great we learned the  importance of keeping our  body temperature in a nice cool level
_JA5sQVGal4,551920,558800,trying to conserve as much water in our  body as possible instead of sweating it  all out
_JA5sQVGal4,558880,564160,nate did not get the memo and continue  doing lots of things that made him sweat  which unfortunately is going to lead him
_JA5sQVGal4,564160,572120,to feeling worse than anyone tonight i  kid you not we just found what's left of  a shovel back in the woods
_JA5sQVGal4,577920,583200,oh yeah that's perfect  hurry you nailed it
_JA5sQVGal4,587760,593760,is that sharp enough i think so a snake  just fell out of a tree right in front  of my face look at its tongue sticking
_JA5sQVGal4,593760,600800,out it is the most camouflaged animal  i've ever seen whoa look at it go up  this tree
_JA5sQVGal4,600800,608079,we learned in our training  that there are snakes here but they're  harmless garden snakes i feel pretty
_JA5sQVGal4,608079,614480,good that it's not going to bite us or  eat us i kind of want to eat him so  coconuts are going to be our sole source
_JA5sQVGal4,614480,620480,of water for this entire experience  there's really two types of coconuts  here on the island we have the green  coconuts which are the ones that are
_JA5sQVGal4,620480,627440,still up in the trees and are growing  and the one that almost fell on kara's  head then we have the brown mature  coconuts the crazy thing about these is
_JA5sQVGal4,627440,634240,the majority of them didn't even come  from this island they fall into the  water and then they wash up on shore and  these can survive out in the ocean for
_JA5sQVGal4,634240,639519,nine months and still have drinkable  liquid inside so the green coconuts you  open with a machete but the brown
_JA5sQVGal4,639519,644880,coconuts because the outside of them has  gotten so hard you have to open them  using a coconut spike which is the
_JA5sQVGal4,644880,649680,pointy stick that we just put in the  ground  yes
_JA5sQVGal4,650560,656079,and 10 minutes later you have the inside  of the coconut even though there were  drinkable brown coconuts all over the
_JA5sQVGal4,656079,662240,ground little did we know this would be  one of our last nate was still fresh  enough to crack this one open but soon
_JA5sQVGal4,662240,669760,none of us would have enough energy to  even make a dent i'm definitely feeling  tired and hungry and thirsty and we just
_JA5sQVGal4,669760,677279,got here but knowing that like we've  skipped lunch  we haven't had anything to drink and we  have not stopped since we got here we
_JA5sQVGal4,677279,683920,deserve this  we've been told that you can drink as  many of the green coconuts as you want
_JA5sQVGal4,683920,689200,but if you drink more than four or five  of these brown ones  you know
_JA5sQVGal4,689200,695120,diarrhea  i don't know if that's gonna stop me  from drinking more of these though
_JA5sQVGal4,697279,704640,well today this is definitely lunch  because  that's peace down my throat
_JA5sQVGal4,704640,712560,this is the only food we have  we also built a bench
_JA5sQVGal4,712639,718160,this tastes amazing right now by the  feeling i'm gonna be so sick of coconuts  by day three he looks like a
_JA5sQVGal4,718160,723440,two-year-old being force-feed green  beans she still hasn't chewed it
_JA5sQVGal4,726560,733200,we've already lost the girls we've only  been out here for about six hours but it  is just so hot and we've had so little
_JA5sQVGal4,733200,740720,water that everyone's already feeling  a little lethargic sarah is what we call  a coconut drunk that's holding on to the
_JA5sQVGal4,740720,746320,edge while she's still sleeping well  jealous if i'm being honest
_JA5sQVGal4,749120,755600,after my little nap i decided to  continue gathering dead palm branches  for our shelter until where is it i
_JA5sQVGal4,755600,762399,think it's a tarantula or just the  biggest spider i've ever seen in my  entire life i also think it might be  dead or close to dead
_JA5sQVGal4,762399,768959,nope not dead oh that's disgusting let's  get it far far away from our camp
_JA5sQVGal4,768959,775680,get him out oh  my oh my gosh oh wow look at that  that is the meanest looking spider i've
_JA5sQVGal4,775680,781440,ever seen he's like  we almost put him in our bed get him out
_JA5sQVGal4,781440,787600,i can't get him out you're gonna have to  do it i'm sorry  whoa look at those fangs
_JA5sQVGal4,787600,792639,get out of here  don't go torch camp oh  we were warned about a lot of things but
_JA5sQVGal4,792639,798639,not those and we just built the entire  top of our roof out of those brown  branches that we found that tarantula in
_JA5sQVGal4,798639,806079,and we're using them for our bedding  unfortunately we're running low on palm  leaf branches for our shelter and we're  only about halfway so nate and dusty
_JA5sQVGal4,806079,811839,have made this contraption and have  pulled down a couple more dead ones
_JA5sQVGal4,811920,817360,it's definitely looking sheltery so we  have about an hour and a half until the  sun sets and our two biggest concerns at
_JA5sQVGal4,817360,823199,this point is one the roof is not  finished and two we haven't found a good  way to get green coconuts so we're all
_JA5sQVGal4,823199,828240,very thirsty and if it rains tonight  we're definitely getting wet the brown  ones just take so much energy to open
_JA5sQVGal4,828240,831440,it's almost not even worth it
_JA5sQVGal4,837680,843760,it worked it was fresh water so this is  called a bottle still and basically you  cut the top off of a smaller bottle and
_JA5sQVGal4,843760,849519,put some salt water in it and the bottom  off of a two liter and fold the bottom
_JA5sQVGal4,849519,857120,of it up then you stick this in the sand  and put this on top and let the sun heat  up and the condensation
_JA5sQVGal4,857120,863040,runs down  into this bottom vent and creates fresh  water it doesn't yield much but it's
_JA5sQVGal4,863040,870240,better than nothing don't try it  [Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,870240,876000,it doesn't taste like salt water but it  tastes like plastic that's true it's a
_JA5sQVGal4,876000,880959,little plasticky we're also drinking out  of trash so
_JA5sQVGal4,883360,889040,so this  is an old termite mound basically this  is just the home that the termite mound
_JA5sQVGal4,889040,895760,makes they chew the bark spit it out  they build their house but within that  there's a an insecticide and so
_JA5sQVGal4,895760,901279,when it burns it releases that pheromone  or whatever it may be but it it makes  quite a sweet sense almost like a
_JA5sQVGal4,901279,906959,justice incense stick and  keeps the samples away so we're going to  light these on fire and stick them
_JA5sQVGal4,906959,912000,around our shelter tonight and hope that  repels at least some of the bugs also i
_JA5sQVGal4,912000,918079,slice my ankle open on a thorn we  thought no shoes would be a fun little  addition to this challenge but that's
_JA5sQVGal4,918079,922519,proving to be one of the toughest parts
_JA5sQVGal4,926880,933839,the sun is setting on our first day of  survival and it has already been a  roller coaster i feel like earlier this
_JA5sQVGal4,933839,940560,morning we started on such a high but  then as the afternoon went on we quickly  realized that coconuts and green palms
_JA5sQVGal4,940560,947040,were going to be much harder to obtain  than we thought we've been able to poke  one out of the tree
_JA5sQVGal4,947040,954240,other than that we're just scrounging  the brown coconuts off the ground and  spending all of our energy trying to  open them on the spike but all in all we
_JA5sQVGal4,954240,960079,got a little water today we started a  fire and we have the majority of a  shelter complete so i don't think we
_JA5sQVGal4,960079,966320,could be too hard on ourselves but one  thing lucas said to us before we left  was savor this time because few people
_JA5sQVGal4,966320,972480,get the opportunity to ever start a  survival situation from scratch so even  though we're very thirsty and starting
_JA5sQVGal4,972480,979040,to get a little uncomfortable and do our  best to soak it all in kara thoughts i'm  a little bit hungry and thirsty but my
_JA5sQVGal4,979040,984079,spirits are high i'm starting to already  worry about tomorrow which is not a very
_JA5sQVGal4,984079,989600,healthy way to think all right before it  gets too dark to film let me show you  our sleeping situation for the night
_JA5sQVGal4,989600,996480,we've got our termite mounds burning to  hopefully keep the bugs away we've got  our fire set up right in front of our  shelter so that the smoke is blowing
_JA5sQVGal4,996480,1002639,back into the shelter to also keep the  bugs away termite mound termite mound  termite mound and then the plan is to
_JA5sQVGal4,1002639,1010000,just sleep on this massive pile of palm  leaves i highly doubt we're getting any  sleep tonight
_JA5sQVGal4,1010000,1013880,thanks for doing this with me
_JA5sQVGal4,1026010,1032558,[Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,1032558,1037240,that was one of the craziest nights of  my life
_JA5sQVGal4,1040220,1046030,[Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,1048580,1055760,[Music]  last night just kind of all feels like a  bad dream so first we crawl into the
_JA5sQVGal4,1055760,1062000,shelter and then we realize we're  getting smothered by the fire that we  created we're just went down trying to  go to sleep
_JA5sQVGal4,1062000,1069679,and we're realizing that we've made a  mistake building the fire a foot in  front of the entrance of the shelter
_JA5sQVGal4,1069679,1075520,it's hard to breathe in there  no bugs  i'm gonna sleep like this good night and
_JA5sQVGal4,1075520,1081919,then as soon as the smoke and the light  go away the crabs come out i'm talking
_JA5sQVGal4,1081919,1088240,crabs this big they're called halloween  moon crabs but we had no way to stop  them from coming in bed with us crawling
_JA5sQVGal4,1088240,1095840,on top of us crawling over our arm  crawling over our leg running into our  heads at one point in the middle of the  night i literally had one climb up the
_JA5sQVGal4,1095840,1101600,back of my shirt it was constant and you  couldn't sleep and then the sand flies  came out they're as small as the tip of
_JA5sQVGal4,1101600,1106799,a needle and these little black bugs  that bite you and make you itch really  bad not sure if you can see those red
_JA5sQVGal4,1106799,1112799,marks those are sand fly bites and  they're all over my hands  my feet then the rest of the night was a
_JA5sQVGal4,1112799,1119440,mixture of sand flies and crabs  it was crazy shampoo is bad last night
_JA5sQVGal4,1119440,1124799,yeah  you can see where my sleeve ended very  clearly so the most important thing that
_JA5sQVGal4,1124799,1130880,we have to figure out today is how to  get green coconuts and more water  yesterday we had these two sticks
_JA5sQVGal4,1130880,1136559,attached with a rope at the very end and  we were trying to reach those two sticks  up to the coconuts and then wrap their
_JA5sQVGal4,1136559,1143600,string around the coconut and pull it  down out of the tree the problem is 99  of the coconuts on this island were just
_JA5sQVGal4,1143600,1148640,out of reach of our stick so this  morning we are going to attempt to build  a ladder that'll let us get a little bit
_JA5sQVGal4,1148640,1155039,higher to be able to reach those  coconuts and pull them down we found two  pieces of bamboo that have washed up on  the beach and we're cutting holes in the
_JA5sQVGal4,1155039,1163559,bamboo and then we're going to cut rungs  that are going to go into the holes and  then we're going to use tree bark to tie  the ladder together
_JA5sQVGal4,1166480,1172400,nature's toothbrush  this is a hibiscus tree and
_JA5sQVGal4,1172400,1178160,little fibers in here  kind of feel like a toothbrush they  definitely make your teeth feel clean
_JA5sQVGal4,1178160,1184110,which is better than nothing so when  you're not eating anything and you're  barely drinking anything your mouth  tastes pretty gross
_JA5sQVGal4,1184110,1190480,[Applause]  wow that kind of looks like a ladder now
_JA5sQVGal4,1190480,1194559,we just have to figure out a way to make  it stay together
_JA5sQVGal4,1197360,1203840,it's pretty good  oh it actually feels pretty solid super  solid
_JA5sQVGal4,1204080,1211039,ready yeah here goes nothing  oh it's such a high first step it's  working you made a ladder
_JA5sQVGal4,1211039,1217679,i'm so close to the coconuts  good work  nicely done
_JA5sQVGal4,1217679,1223120,i feel so good right now i still can't  believe i haven't had coffee i'm  impressed i feel like i need some coffee
_JA5sQVGal4,1223120,1230240,i also didn't build a ladder this  morning so dusty had the genius idea to  build a lasso out of hibiscus bark on
_JA5sQVGal4,1230240,1237039,top of our really long piece of bamboo  so the goal is climb up the ladder loop  the lasso around the coconut and pull it
_JA5sQVGal4,1237039,1243679,down  it feels pretty strong i think this is  strong enough i think standing on the
_JA5sQVGal4,1243679,1249840,ladder and trying to loop it is going to  be more difficult than it appears
_JA5sQVGal4,1252480,1257679,ah  okay  plan  f so this was what we were trying
_JA5sQVGal4,1257679,1263120,yesterday but we didn't have enough pipe  to reach any of the coconuts but we're  hoping we can stick this string either
_JA5sQVGal4,1263120,1268480,over a coconut or in behind it and then  we'll twist these two together and then  we'll just pull and that'll break the
_JA5sQVGal4,1268480,1275000,coconut off the tree theoretically just  follow me up as high as you can
_JA5sQVGal4,1279120,1285440,highs and lows highs and lows they said  okay  while the guys continue to attempt to
_JA5sQVGal4,1285440,1291520,get the coconuts down i'm gonna work on  our bed situation we've got to do  something about the crabs i'm starting
_JA5sQVGal4,1291520,1297520,by putting some logs on either side  however crabs can climb straight up  trees so that's not going to do much but
_JA5sQVGal4,1297520,1303679,what they can't climb  is plastic so my plan is to dig a trench
_JA5sQVGal4,1303679,1310400,on the outside of our logs i'm gonna  line it with bottles and then  bury them in my little crab fence
_JA5sQVGal4,1310400,1316320,construction project really took it out  of me and it turned into another mini  nap time then i woke up to what i
_JA5sQVGal4,1316320,1323840,thought could only be a drain oh my gosh  beautiful water water
_JA5sQVGal4,1324000,1329919,oh  oh it's so good oh this just solved the  hardest challenge of the trip we kept
_JA5sQVGal4,1329919,1335919,the fire going we're collecting water  thank you  that was
_JA5sQVGal4,1335919,1341679,absolutely amazing i drank four bowls of  water falling out of the tree and then  as we were collecting it in this whole
_JA5sQVGal4,1341679,1347360,two liter i realized it looked like this  it was just like falling down through  the bark of the palm leaves and got a
_JA5sQVGal4,1347360,1353520,little color but this  is more water than i had to drink all of  yesterday what a way to wake up i was
_JA5sQVGal4,1353520,1358720,still half asleep and i heard nate say  it was raining so it kind of scooched  behind our shelter that we made and i
_JA5sQVGal4,1358720,1366080,was like oh i'm still dry and then i  wasn't our bed is now soaking wet feels  like i had a little bit of a shower oh
_JA5sQVGal4,1366080,1372159,i'm torn though i want to take this  coffee i mean i want to take this water  and make a coffee so i can feel alive
_JA5sQVGal4,1372159,1379039,but i know coffee is dehydrating and  water is a little hard to come by right  now you think you got this no
_JA5sQVGal4,1379039,1384640,nice  wow nicely
_JA5sQVGal4,1386480,1391760,i can't believe i'm drinking dirty rain  water out of trash
_JA5sQVGal4,1393360,1398960,wow  i cannot believe we got all this water  it only rained for like
_JA5sQVGal4,1398960,1404400,what 20 minutes what do i win do i get  something  just when we were finished celebrating
_JA5sQVGal4,1404400,1410159,our one bottle of rainwater a second  rainstorm came through and we got 11
_JA5sQVGal4,1410159,1416000,bottles of water for breakfast i'm  attempting to make us some toasted  coconut i'm just putting the coconut
_JA5sQVGal4,1416000,1422240,meat directly on the embers and we've  been told that once it cooks it tastes a  little bit like popcorn at this point
_JA5sQVGal4,1422240,1431480,anything that doesn't taste exactly like  coconut sounds pretty good  oh my gosh it smells so good
_JA5sQVGal4,1434000,1439520,whoa it tastes more like barbecue than  popcorn it's so good mmm i meant more we
_JA5sQVGal4,1439520,1445360,have one last plan to try so taking the  paracord off of the bow drill tied a  rock to the end of it and i'm going to
_JA5sQVGal4,1445360,1450559,attempt to throw this rock hope the  paracord loops around the coconut and  then pull it down even though we had
_JA5sQVGal4,1450559,1456320,what felt like a lifetime supply of  water it still wasn't enough for all  four of us to stay hydrated for the next
_JA5sQVGal4,1456320,1462639,48 hours so the green coconut challenge  continued  got a branch
_JA5sQVGal4,1466320,1471679,like even if we get the coconut down  because we have water it doesn't mean  like that big of a score
_JA5sQVGal4,1471679,1476400,yeah i agree the coconuts can kind of  wait until tomorrow i guess
_JA5sQVGal4,1479279,1486640,it's so crazy how quickly  i'll go from here  to here we were all feeling so good we
_JA5sQVGal4,1486640,1491919,caught all that rain we had eaten our  coconut popcorn i had so much energy and
_JA5sQVGal4,1491919,1498799,then just all of a sudden i've crashed  some of it could be the  caffeine addiction i barely feel like i
_JA5sQVGal4,1498799,1506559,can hold the camera just trying to  remind myself that we chose to do this  and we get to do this
_JA5sQVGal4,1509279,1515919,we've had a slight setback remember how  i said we were going to do primitive  fishing for the first 36 hours i had
_JA5sQVGal4,1515919,1524080,weaved 15 feet of this super thin line  and then i left it laying on a log last  night and i'm pretty positive a crab
_JA5sQVGal4,1524080,1529760,carried my homemade fishing line into  the woods even though it's tiny and it's  made out of bark
_JA5sQVGal4,1529760,1536000,i can't break it even if i'm using all  of my might so that was plan a for  catching a fish plan b is to take apart
_JA5sQVGal4,1536000,1542080,the paracord that i was just using to  try to get the coconuts and inside the  paracord there are about six smaller
_JA5sQVGal4,1542080,1547279,ropes and we'll tie all of these  together and then we'll use this bone  hook that we made to hopefully snag a
_JA5sQVGal4,1547279,1552640,fish i'm sorry it's okay  i think i found another one oh no i
_JA5sQVGal4,1552640,1559120,think the crabs literally buried it and  then just chopped it up they did not  want us to fish stupid cribs kept us up
_JA5sQVGal4,1559120,1565919,all night ate our fishing line i'll get  it set up and dusty and i will try to go  catch some fish
_JA5sQVGal4,1569279,1575120,we all decided to take a nap during the  hottest part of the day but not sure if  that was a great idea we're all feeling
_JA5sQVGal4,1575120,1580159,pretty lethargic after that but dusty  and i have gotten ourselves up we're  gonna hopefully go catch some fish i
_JA5sQVGal4,1580159,1585840,think the lack of food is really what's  hitting us now  almost
_JA5sQVGal4,1586000,1593279,math is hard right now almost 30 hours  in at this point all we've had is  coconuts eating several different ways
_JA5sQVGal4,1593279,1598400,so sarah and i have hit a second wind  and now since they're going to catch
_JA5sQVGal4,1598400,1604960,fish we are using seashells to scrape  out this coconut flesh into a bowl and  then we're going to squeeze it to make
_JA5sQVGal4,1604960,1612000,coconut milk to eat coconut curry for  dinner so this is our fishing setup  we've wrapped the line from the paracord
_JA5sQVGal4,1612000,1617120,around a plastic bottle we have the bone  hook tied on to the end and then we're
_JA5sQVGal4,1617120,1624039,using a little crab for bait wish this  walk  good luck
_JA5sQVGal4,1630320,1637320,our  only bone hook is stuck on a rock  first cast
_JA5sQVGal4,1643279,1649520,no way  oh  okay we have about an hour and a half  until the sun sets and this homemade
_JA5sQVGal4,1649520,1655840,fishing contraption that the hook just  fell off of is not working at all i mean  fish are biting it we just can't catch
_JA5sQVGal4,1655840,1663360,them with this  bone technically we were not supposed to  use the fishing kit that we brought with  us until hour 36 it's currently hour 31
_JA5sQVGal4,1663360,1669520,but we've decided to make a compromise  we are going to use the fishing kit five  hours early in hopes of eating something
_JA5sQVGal4,1669520,1676799,besides coconut tonight do i feel a  little guilty about bending the rules  yes am i starving also yes let's go see
_JA5sQVGal4,1676799,1683360,if we can catch some fish  no  no you lost it calories so the new
_JA5sQVGal4,1683360,1688480,fishing setup is almost exactly the same  we're still using a plastic bottle we  just have real fishing line and most
_JA5sQVGal4,1688480,1696559,importantly a real hook  hey we have a fish come on get him up
_JA5sQVGal4,1696559,1701760,whoa  it's a small guy i got one oh it's a  good one it's a good one if i can get it
_JA5sQVGal4,1701760,1710240,up no gosh no  it was like this big we've shaved as  much coconut as we humanly could and now
_JA5sQVGal4,1710240,1715840,we are using this natural  burlap that comes from the palm tree to
_JA5sQVGal4,1715840,1721690,hopefully squeeze out some beautiful  fresh coconut cream it's beautiful
_JA5sQVGal4,1721690,1729840,[Music]  oh no i just wasted half our coconut  cream it's okay we have more
_JA5sQVGal4,1734559,1740880,it's not much but it's dinner  all right we're gonna store our coconut  cream in this cute glass bottle we found
_JA5sQVGal4,1740880,1746640,on the beach one man's trash is a  survivor's treasure  wow
_JA5sQVGal4,1746640,1753120,that's a lot  i cannot believe we made this so fishing  was not quite as fruitful as we had
_JA5sQVGal4,1753120,1760159,hoped for but we are eating more than  coconut tonight so this afternoon sarah  and i made some hibiscus sun tea we can
_JA5sQVGal4,1760159,1766159,pick these beautiful red and orange ones  yeah and just make a sun tea you don't  need to cook it you just steep it in
_JA5sQVGal4,1766159,1773120,water  so fun so we're gonna have a little  sunset  tea time it really lifted my spirits
_JA5sQVGal4,1773120,1779360,cheers  day two of survival this is luxury
_JA5sQVGal4,1779440,1785600,it's nice to have something added to the  coconut  yeah it's half coconut water and half
_JA5sQVGal4,1785600,1791600,rain water  it's about to get dark honestly i'm
_JA5sQVGal4,1791600,1797600,hurting a little bit more than i thought  i would like if i played ping-pong a  three-year-old could beat me right now
_JA5sQVGal4,1797600,1804159,you just do everything like so much  slower and weaker it seems i definitely
_JA5sQVGal4,1804159,1809840,am looking forward to like pizza  honestly any food that's not coconut i
_JA5sQVGal4,1809840,1816159,mean it could be my least favorite food  in the world and i would still love it  celery i'd take some celery you would
_JA5sQVGal4,1816159,1821520,eat celery right now probably the  biggest disappointment of today though  was
_JA5sQVGal4,1821520,1829440,how hard neonate works to build that  ladder and then the ladder actually  working but then it not helping anything
_JA5sQVGal4,1829440,1833720,yeah a hermit crab
_JA5sQVGal4,1838640,1840880,wow
_JA5sQVGal4,1846320,1853039,it's  2 30 in the morning  just started raining  and i came out to start the fire back up
_JA5sQVGal4,1853039,1859840,so that we don't lose it i don't think  i've slept  at all  the crabs are even worse tonight one
_JA5sQVGal4,1859840,1863398,pinched my toe
_JA5sQVGal4,1869919,1876480,well i can confidently say that that was  the worst night of sleep in my entire  life  somehow
_JA5sQVGal4,1876480,1881760,the crabs were worse and they got back  just from sleeping on the ground for the  night before
_JA5sQVGal4,1881760,1887679,i just can't take it anymore the night's  definitely the hardest part of this none  of us said it out loud to each other at
_JA5sQVGal4,1887679,1893760,the time because we didn't want to bring  down the group but later we learned that  we all woke up feeling the same on this
_JA5sQVGal4,1893760,1898799,morning which was terrible we had major  headaches and we're all a little
_JA5sQVGal4,1898799,1907559,nauseous  [Music]  i need this this morning
_JA5sQVGal4,1909919,1916919,in addition to crabs and rain last night  i also feel like i just sweated the  entire night
_JA5sQVGal4,1920399,1926159,morning  last night was so wild first of all  there was no wind and it was just
_JA5sQVGal4,1926159,1931760,so hot somehow there were more crabs  last night than the night before because
_JA5sQVGal4,1931760,1937679,of the barrier i made i think they were  all trapped in here really hoping i can  get a cup of coffee this morning it's
_JA5sQVGal4,1937679,1945440,been 48 hours and we've had zero  caffeine i think we have enough water  that it's not an irresponsible decision
_JA5sQVGal4,1945440,1952799,maybe it still is but i really need some  i feel so much better after that swim
_JA5sQVGal4,1952799,1959440,last night when we all had more energy  and we were sitting around the fire we  decided today we could either survive or
_JA5sQVGal4,1959440,1965919,thrive surviving would just be sitting  around drinking the rain water that we  collected yesterday and pretty much just
_JA5sQVGal4,1965919,1971279,not doing very much of anything until  the boat picks us up tomorrow morning  but we decided we'd rather remember our
_JA5sQVGal4,1971279,1976799,time here on the island as thriving so  we've set three goals for ourselves want  to make a coconut fish curry shell
_JA5sQVGal4,1976799,1982960,necklaces as souvenirs to remember the  trip pie and this morning i'm going to  finally attempt to make carrot coffee
_JA5sQVGal4,1982960,1990039,using a coconut we'll see if we can all  muster up enough energy to accomplish  these three things
_JA5sQVGal4,1990080,1996720,so here's the plan for coffee we're  going to attempt to boil water in this  gourd we're going to take this coconut  that has a hole in the bottom and we're
_JA5sQVGal4,1996720,2002240,going to put the natural burlap from the  palm tree down in the coconut as a  filter then we'll pour the boiling water
_JA5sQVGal4,2002240,2008399,over the coffee and it'll drip down to  our cup it's like an island pour over  okay here goes one very valuable bottle
_JA5sQVGal4,2008399,2015039,of water  the gourd can't go directly in the fire  so i'm having to just surround it with
_JA5sQVGal4,2015039,2020960,inverse  oh it's falling apart
_JA5sQVGal4,2020960,2026640,no  coffee  we have coffee but it's not gonna be
_JA5sQVGal4,2026640,2032159,easy to make our coconut curry later  today without our bowl that i burnt to a  crisp that is the longest it's ever
_JA5sQVGal4,2032159,2038240,taken me to make coffee and the end was  the most stressful coffee making  experience that i've ever had in my life
_JA5sQVGal4,2038240,2041799,thank you
_JA5sQVGal4,2046159,2051480,wow it's the strongest coffee i've ever  had in my life it is also the most
_JA5sQVGal4,2051480,2057200,anticipated cup of coffee  i've ever had but i currently feel the
_JA5sQVGal4,2057200,2065679,weakest i've ever felt in my life this  probably isn't what i should be drinking  but it's all i want
_JA5sQVGal4,2066878,2072398,i can't do it anymore  you look like a two-year-old being  force-feed green beans she still hasn't
_JA5sQVGal4,2072398,2078480,chewed it it is crazy how much our taste  buds are changing even things we were  eating yesterday like the roasted
_JA5sQVGal4,2078480,2084720,coconut no one in the group can think  about that without gagging a little bit  cara hasn't even finished her coffee
_JA5sQVGal4,2084720,2090158,honestly i just don't want my brain to  explode  okay now that i have a little bit of an
_JA5sQVGal4,2090158,2098000,energy boost from my coffee i thought  i'd give you a full tour of our camp  starting with our shelter it's not quite
_JA5sQVGal4,2098000,2104560,waterproof we're calling it water  resistant but it's enough and most  importantly i think it's a good shelter
_JA5sQVGal4,2104560,2109839,from coconuts that are falling so  knowing that i can sleep in a coconut  wouldn't hit me directly in the head
_JA5sQVGal4,2109839,2116000,helps me relax a little bit more i  wouldn't say that our bed is comfy when  the crabs are moving around it's just so
_JA5sQVGal4,2116000,2121760,much louder which is also kind of a good  thing because then i know they're coming  and i can sit up and shoot them away
_JA5sQVGal4,2121760,2127680,speaking of crabs my crab fence that i  made out of plastic bottles that i found  on the beach
_JA5sQVGal4,2127680,2133599,i don't know if it did anything at all i  can confirm that it did nothing at all i  think the crabs were worse last night
_JA5sQVGal4,2133599,2138800,than they were the first night they dig  these little holes like that's a crab  hole
_JA5sQVGal4,2138800,2144640,that's a crab hole crab hole  gravel crab hole no telling how many of
_JA5sQVGal4,2144640,2149760,these are under our bed it's not their  fault but i do resent them at this point  because they got into my coffee bag they
_JA5sQVGal4,2149760,2156000,ate nate's homemade fishing line and  they keep me up all night okay moving on  over here we have our
_JA5sQVGal4,2156000,2162400,fire pit at nate and destiny with their  own two hands  this is a very multi-purpose area it's
_JA5sQVGal4,2162400,2169440,like the sit-down area on these little  flat benches that we brought over here  up here above the fire is a great quick
_JA5sQVGal4,2169440,2175200,drying place because you have the heat  and the breeze and things up here dry in  like five minutes throughout the day
_JA5sQVGal4,2175200,2181520,we'll all grab some firewood and we've  been storing it over here in these nice  little piles that dusty's made for us
_JA5sQVGal4,2181520,2188480,here in the middle of the living area we  have a coffee table made out of this  bucket that washed up on the beach
_JA5sQVGal4,2188480,2193520,underneath the bucket we're keeping some  of our fire starting supplies
_JA5sQVGal4,2193520,2199920,just in case it rains we want to keep  this nice and dry  this is the coconut that almost knocked
_JA5sQVGal4,2199920,2205760,me out last night we were just sitting  here enjoying the fire we heard the  branches we heard it breaking and we all
_JA5sQVGal4,2205760,2212960,just went like this  and it fell  right in the middle of the fire very  dramatic sparks flew and missed us all
_JA5sQVGal4,2212960,2220000,just by a few feet very scary  this is the view we get to go to sleep  and wake up to every day
_JA5sQVGal4,2220000,2226320,but we've just been so focused on  surviving that we haven't taken it in  enough moving on to the kitchen first
_JA5sQVGal4,2226320,2232320,aid kit just in case we've created a  little makeshift kitchen table right  here using a piece of foam we found on
_JA5sQVGal4,2232320,2237839,the beach here we have our fishing hooks  chopsticks we made out of hibiscus  leaves
_JA5sQVGal4,2237839,2243040,whoa our coffee our bowls the coconut  cream mancera made and all the water
_JA5sQVGal4,2243040,2248320,that we caught yesterday is just sitting  right here in front of the kitchen table  we are down to
_JA5sQVGal4,2248320,2254800,one  half half quarter we're pretty much down  to two full bottles of water to last us
_JA5sQVGal4,2254800,2260079,the rest of the day which i think is  enough this area is what we're calling  the workbench it's kind of like the
_JA5sQVGal4,2260079,2265760,garage we have this stump that we've  sharpened to open the coconuts right
_JA5sQVGal4,2265760,2271839,here and this is where we can kind of  assemble things these are all of our  coconuts that we've chopped open we're
_JA5sQVGal4,2271839,2277599,not very tidy here on the island we just  kind of throw things down when we're  done here we have another clothesline
_JA5sQVGal4,2277599,2285839,that we've made out of hibiscus tree  bark if you follow me down to the sea  i'll show you where our bathroom is
_JA5sQVGal4,2286240,2292880,i don't know about everybody else but  i've been using this little nook  as my bathroom nice little private area
_JA5sQVGal4,2292880,2299280,and no doubt the best view i've ever had  from the potty  also since we're not eating very much
_JA5sQVGal4,2299280,2304400,we're not having to deal with number  twos very much as you can imagine  hibiscus sleeves make great natural
_JA5sQVGal4,2304400,2310960,toilet paper feels very natural i really  enjoy it behind me is where nate and  jessie have been fishing every day so
_JA5sQVGal4,2310960,2316720,the beach just kind of turns into rock  right here and you can follow it all the  way around this peninsula and last but
_JA5sQVGal4,2316720,2323640,not least we have the world's largest  saltwater pool
_JA5sQVGal4,2329680,2335359,like we said before this survival  challenge was full of highs and lows and  we realized that we were a lot better at
_JA5sQVGal4,2335359,2341280,capturing the high moments than the low  ones at this point i had half a coconut  of espresso coursing through my blood
_JA5sQVGal4,2341280,2347200,and i was able to really turn it on for  the camera however just before this  simply walking to the beach to use the
_JA5sQVGal4,2347200,2353359,potty would make my heart pound i'd have  to sit down and catch my breath before  walking just 30 steps back to the camp
_JA5sQVGal4,2353359,2359200,so even though it's a little hard to  tell for every cheerful moment you see  just know there was also a low moment or
_JA5sQVGal4,2359200,2367839,at least a nap  for lunch today we're gonna attempt to  make a coconut fish curry basically fish
_JA5sQVGal4,2367839,2374960,in coconut milk yesterday sarah and i  made this beautiful creamy coconut cream
_JA5sQVGal4,2374960,2381359,so that mixed with the little rain water  makes more of a coconut milk so we're  gonna pour that in this bowl i'm gonna
_JA5sQVGal4,2381359,2388320,pour the rain water in our milk jug just  to make sure we get every last bit we  worked hard for this coconut cream that
_JA5sQVGal4,2388320,2394160,looks really good now we're gonna heat  up our coconut milk on the fire and  that's gonna be our broth so dusty and i
_JA5sQVGal4,2394160,2400079,went out fishing early this morning and  we caught these two little guys they've  been cleaned and gutted on the inside so
_JA5sQVGal4,2400079,2405440,i'm just wrapping it in two leaves and  then i've just cut some strips of the  hibiscus bark i'm just gonna wrap it
_JA5sQVGal4,2405440,2412480,around and tie it up and now we're gonna  throw these on the fire to fully cook  before adding them to the broth
_JA5sQVGal4,2421040,2426960,the leaf is stuck to his skin  got to try a little piece of this by  itself
_JA5sQVGal4,2426960,2434240,oh it's still good it's unfair because  if i chewed on this chopstick long  enough it might taste good
_JA5sQVGal4,2434960,2441040,oh my goodness we almost died oh my gosh  again oh
_JA5sQVGal4,2441040,2446400,my gosh bowling ball  feeling and weighted thing just fell out
_JA5sQVGal4,2446400,2452640,of the tree straight onto our bed  this island is safe in so many ways but
_JA5sQVGal4,2452640,2458960,also deadly in a couple ways like  getting hit in the head with a coconut  there's also the deadliest tree in the
_JA5sQVGal4,2458960,2464480,world just a few hundred meters down the  beach it begins by being delicious and  you go i'm loving this and then it gets
_JA5sQVGal4,2464480,2469839,peppery and you start to feel tingling  and your throat can close and you can  asphyxiate
_JA5sQVGal4,2469839,2475680,as a final touch we're adding just a few  of these little island succulents  they're very salty and just have a
_JA5sQVGal4,2475680,2481920,little bit of crunch to them kind of  like a snap pea just makes this curry  feel extra fancy okay
_JA5sQVGal4,2481920,2489599,first bite  oh my gosh that literally just melted in
_JA5sQVGal4,2489599,2496160,my mouth man today's a good day coffee  and curry we're definitely thriving
_JA5sQVGal4,2496630,2499979,[Applause]
_JA5sQVGal4,2501920,2507040,i think in my everyday life i would  actually love this but because i've had
_JA5sQVGal4,2507040,2512880,so much coconut i'm just gonna stick  with a plain fish something about the  smell and tasty coconut gives me a
_JA5sQVGal4,2512880,2519040,little bit of a gag reflex  i might be over coconut too so it's all
_JA5sQVGal4,2519040,2526319,mine  man this is my day you see the little  teeth on this guy wow
_JA5sQVGal4,2526319,2533040,eating and digesting takes a lot of  water in your body so if you are  dehydrated and then you eat you're even
_JA5sQVGal4,2533040,2538319,more dehydrated so we were told if we  weren't drinking enough water throughout  the day then we probably shouldn't eat
_JA5sQVGal4,2538319,2543760,either what's crazy is we've been  thirsty more than we've been hungry so i
_JA5sQVGal4,2543760,2550480,think our bodies naturally know not to  give us those hunger pains because we  need water more than we need food we
_JA5sQVGal4,2550480,2557200,also learned that fat takes the most  water in your body to digest and coconut  is pretty much all fat it makes sense
_JA5sQVGal4,2557200,2560000,that we're over it
_JA5sQVGal4,2563440,2569599,we're just standing here brushing our  teeth and realize that we have no idea  what day of the week it is not a clue
_JA5sQVGal4,2569599,2574720,and then brushing our teeth with this  stick almost feels normal at this point
_JA5sQVGal4,2576720,2582480,bling  it's amazing to me that you haven't
_JA5sQVGal4,2582480,2590160,properly eaten or drank in three days  and you're still worried about the shot  being cooked  we had a super restful afternoon there
_JA5sQVGal4,2590160,2596880,were a lot of naps taken and there was  also a lot of jewelry made i made a  bracelet and we have mounting necklaces
_JA5sQVGal4,2596880,2603920,it might not look like much but the fact  that you can make  rope this small using the bark of a tree
_JA5sQVGal4,2603920,2609520,like i hand wove this entire necklace  this was a fun way to pass the time this  afternoon without it spending too much
_JA5sQVGal4,2609520,2617359,energy  can you hear that plane it's so weird  when you live away from like city noise
_JA5sQVGal4,2617359,2623119,how loud a plane is going overhead i  never recognize a plane going overhead  in normal everyday life but here i'm
_JA5sQVGal4,2623119,2629359,like  ah what is that machine  today we thrived we marked off all three
_JA5sQVGal4,2629359,2635920,things on our to-do list and i feel like  i still have a little extra energy left  over weirdly enough i think all four of
_JA5sQVGal4,2635920,2641839,us feel the best we felt this evening  but it almost feels like our bodies are  kind of getting used to it there's
_JA5sQVGal4,2641839,2647040,literally no food unless i go physically  get it i was gonna say our only two
_JA5sQVGal4,2647040,2652640,options are coconut and fish actually  that is incorrect even though we pretty  much only ate coconut and fish there
_JA5sQVGal4,2652640,2658560,were several other food options on the  island including a noni tree aka  starvation fruit which is actually a
_JA5sQVGal4,2658560,2664079,superfood but we weren't starving yet  however all of these things were on the  opposite side of the island and walking
_JA5sQVGal4,2664079,2670079,even a hundred yards literally felt  equivalent to running a marathon in the  sahara desert so as crazy as it sounds
_JA5sQVGal4,2670079,2676480,we just didn't have the energy plus in a  weird way our bodies just didn't want  food i'm very proud of us and i'm very
_JA5sQVGal4,2676480,2682640,grateful that you've done this with me  it really is a life-changing experience
_JA5sQVGal4,2682640,2688640,in every way i'll never be the same i  feel like anything we have  words are kind of hard right now i feel
_JA5sQVGal4,2688640,2695920,like anything we do after this is gonna  feel easy yeah that and just  appreciating every little luxury as
_JA5sQVGal4,2695920,2703920,small as a toothbrush or deodorant and  then like all the food we have access to  all the running water and trash oh my
_JA5sQVGal4,2703920,2709599,gosh i'm never using a plastic bottle  again i think the biggest difference  between what we've experienced here and
_JA5sQVGal4,2709599,2714720,the survival shows that i used to watch  as a kid is when i was watching on tv i  was like oh i'd be building all this
_JA5sQVGal4,2714720,2721760,stuff i was thinking about all the  things i would do but then when we got  here we started doing it i realized you  just have no energy to do these things
_JA5sQVGal4,2721760,2728000,it's this constant game of  anything i want to build do or eat how  much energy is that going to take okay
_JA5sQVGal4,2728000,2734079,now all we have to do is sleep one more  night with the crabs and then the boat  comes to pick us up at 8 am the sunset's
_JA5sQVGal4,2734079,2739760,so bittersweet because it's like oh wow  oh it's so beautiful and it's not hot i  literally can't see anything for the
_JA5sQVGal4,2739760,2745640,rest of the night and i have to get in  bed with crabs and then you just hear  them
_JA5sQVGal4,2747060,2751480,[Music]
_JA5sQVGal4,2754800,2761119,okay i'm about to turn a light on to see  how many crabs are in our bed  one two three
_JA5sQVGal4,2761119,2768000,get out of here out get out there's a  lay in there  under the leaves and i see you
_JA5sQVGal4,2768000,2774599,now i'd like you to leave get out out no  not under my pillow
_JA5sQVGal4,2777119,2783119,our rescue boat arrives in 30 minutes  somehow it didn't rain all of last night  as soon as we got out of bed this
_JA5sQVGal4,2783119,2789920,morning  get me off this  island i can't believe it's over i'm not
_JA5sQVGal4,2789920,2795920,sure that we did a great job of  capturing it but standing there in the  rain we all agreed this was the hardest
_JA5sQVGal4,2795920,2801280,thing we had ever done but knowing the  boat would arrive any minute kept our  spirits high even after being out here
_JA5sQVGal4,2801280,2807680,for a full three days it's still hard  for me to fathom what it would be like  in a real survival situation where there
_JA5sQVGal4,2807680,2813680,was no timeline or even a guarantee that  rescue was coming the boat ended up  being 15 minutes late due to the heavy
_JA5sQVGal4,2813680,2820200,rain and even that short amount of time  felt like an eternity
_JA5sQVGal4,2823119,2828480,a boat engine has never sounded more  beautiful it's so beautiful oh we did it
_JA5sQVGal4,2828480,2834000,we survived we did your dream  is it a dream come true
_JA5sQVGal4,2834000,2842200,yeah dream come true that i never want  to have again  there you go team
_JA5sQVGal4,2844960,2850640,nice work guys i appreciate it wait  daddy you're on the boat
_JA5sQVGal4,2850880,2856480,i've never been so happy to see this  boat oh it's so hard let's go to
_JA5sQVGal4,2856480,2862319,civilization  if you've enjoyed these last two videos  and you want to try it for yourself
_JA5sQVGal4,2862319,2867920,we've left a link for desert island  survival in the description below as you  can probably tell tom is awesome and he
_JA5sQVGal4,2867920,2876000,will help you out plus they also do  trips in tonga so maybe we'll see you  there in like a year we need some time
