qzUCPoLWbu8,160,3280,hello everybody so check out what i am
qzUCPoLWbu8,3280,6480,standing next to this is the all-new
qzUCPoLWbu8,6480,10559,2023 lexus rx and not just the regular
qzUCPoLWbu8,10559,15440,rx this is the brand new 500 hs sport
qzUCPoLWbu8,15440,17680,performance model and what we're going
qzUCPoLWbu8,17680,20320,to do tonight is take a quick look and
qzUCPoLWbu8,20320,22560,walk around of this brand new lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,22560,24960,model because as you guys know this is a
qzUCPoLWbu8,24960,27359,very very important product for the
qzUCPoLWbu8,27359,29599,lexus lineup this is the best selling
qzUCPoLWbu8,29599,31599,lexus suv and one of the best-selling
qzUCPoLWbu8,31599,35120,luxury vehicles period for basically the
qzUCPoLWbu8,35120,37920,past 20 years so let's go ahead and jump
qzUCPoLWbu8,37920,40160,right in and see everything that's new
qzUCPoLWbu8,40160,44200,with this brand new rx
qzUCPoLWbu8,54960,58160,so with this next generation of the rx
qzUCPoLWbu8,58160,60160,of course you're gonna have a spindle
qzUCPoLWbu8,60160,62160,grill because that is signature lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,62160,64320,but this is a new evolution of the
qzUCPoLWbu8,64320,66159,spindle grill one of the things you'll
qzUCPoLWbu8,66159,68560,notice is that the grill itself doesn't
qzUCPoLWbu8,68560,70479,really have a border anymore and it
qzUCPoLWbu8,70479,73200,basically blends into the body now like
qzUCPoLWbu8,73200,75680,i mentioned earlier we are in the s
qzUCPoLWbu8,75680,78799,sport performance model the 500h that is
qzUCPoLWbu8,78799,80880,of course going to make this fascia more
qzUCPoLWbu8,80880,82159,aggressive
qzUCPoLWbu8,82159,85360,than the standard 350 model
qzUCPoLWbu8,85360,87040,which has a little bit of a different
qzUCPoLWbu8,87040,88880,texture this is going to be a full black
qzUCPoLWbu8,88880,89840,mesh
qzUCPoLWbu8,89840,91920,the other big element of course with
qzUCPoLWbu8,91920,95040,this next generation model is this
qzUCPoLWbu8,95040,97439,kind of area that bleeds from the hood
qzUCPoLWbu8,97439,99759,and goes into the grill
qzUCPoLWbu8,99759,100400,so
qzUCPoLWbu8,100400,101840,when i first saw this you know i was
qzUCPoLWbu8,101840,103920,like i don't know but here in person it
qzUCPoLWbu8,103920,105600,actually looks pretty good
qzUCPoLWbu8,105600,107360,i do like how it just
qzUCPoLWbu8,107360,109360,basically bleeds this whole spindle
qzUCPoLWbu8,109360,112079,grill into the vehicle itself makes it
qzUCPoLWbu8,112079,113680,seem a little bit more cohesive and
qzUCPoLWbu8,113680,115200,stands out a little less than some of
qzUCPoLWbu8,115200,117360,the past lexus products
qzUCPoLWbu8,117360,118640,now i also want to go ahead and talk
qzUCPoLWbu8,118640,120880,about your headlights now no lexus would
qzUCPoLWbu8,120880,123920,be complete without having your full led
qzUCPoLWbu8,123920,125520,lights with that signature arrowhead
qzUCPoLWbu8,125520,127119,daytime running light i am happy to see
qzUCPoLWbu8,127119,129280,that has carried on for this next
qzUCPoLWbu8,129280,131440,generation model and of course you do
qzUCPoLWbu8,131440,134080,have the latest led technologies with
qzUCPoLWbu8,134080,136000,the crystal design obviously we don't
qzUCPoLWbu8,136000,137680,have it lit up right now but you can
qzUCPoLWbu8,137680,139200,kind of take a quick look inside of
qzUCPoLWbu8,139200,140959,there and it does look like we also have
qzUCPoLWbu8,140959,143200,headlamp washers on board and then this
qzUCPoLWbu8,143200,144959,sport performance model is going to
qzUCPoLWbu8,144959,147280,throw in the led fog lamps as well as
qzUCPoLWbu8,147280,148959,the aggressive area down here in the
qzUCPoLWbu8,148959,151680,lower fascia
qzUCPoLWbu8,152640,154239,let's continue on to the side here and
qzUCPoLWbu8,154239,156400,take a look at our wheels
qzUCPoLWbu8,156400,158160,obviously this is the fully loaded
qzUCPoLWbu8,158160,159840,performance model so we are going to
qzUCPoLWbu8,159840,160720,have
qzUCPoLWbu8,160720,163120,very nice looking wheels with the rx
qzUCPoLWbu8,163120,165440,lineup you're going to have 19 through
qzUCPoLWbu8,165440,168319,21 inch alloy options these are 21s
qzUCPoLWbu8,168319,170480,they're finished in the kind of a matte
qzUCPoLWbu8,170480,172959,black let mason kind of get close there
qzUCPoLWbu8,172959,175280,and take a good look at that really nice
qzUCPoLWbu8,175280,177280,looking in person especially in contrast
qzUCPoLWbu8,177280,179040,to the pearly white paint that we have
qzUCPoLWbu8,179040,181440,on board we also have black finish here
qzUCPoLWbu8,181440,185120,for our brake calipers
qzUCPoLWbu8,185120,188959,and a big important part of this 500h
qzUCPoLWbu8,188959,191280,performance model is the fact that we
qzUCPoLWbu8,191280,194080,have the body colored
qzUCPoLWbu8,194080,196480,moldings around the wheels as well as
qzUCPoLWbu8,196480,198480,down the bottom and all around the back
qzUCPoLWbu8,198480,200640,so that again is going to support that
qzUCPoLWbu8,200640,202720,very aggressive look on board in
qzUCPoLWbu8,202720,204640,addition to the blacked out mirrors that
qzUCPoLWbu8,204640,206959,we have on board as well
qzUCPoLWbu8,206959,208560,now let mason go ahead and back up a
qzUCPoLWbu8,208560,212239,little bit and we'll talk about the side
qzUCPoLWbu8,212239,215840,this is riding on toyota's new gak
qzUCPoLWbu8,215840,217599,platform and one of the interesting
qzUCPoLWbu8,217599,219599,things about this is the fact that the
qzUCPoLWbu8,219599,222400,wheelbase has been increased by two
qzUCPoLWbu8,222400,224560,inches however the overhangs in the
qzUCPoLWbu8,224560,226159,front and the rear have been decreased
qzUCPoLWbu8,226159,228560,by two inches and the end result of that
qzUCPoLWbu8,228560,230000,is the fact that we actually have the
qzUCPoLWbu8,230000,232560,exact same length overall as the
qzUCPoLWbu8,232560,235760,outgoing generation 192.5
qzUCPoLWbu8,235760,236799,inches
qzUCPoLWbu8,236799,238400,this is the standard wheelbase we
qzUCPoLWbu8,238400,241280,haven't heard any word on if the
qzUCPoLWbu8,241280,243040,rxl is going to make a return for the
qzUCPoLWbu8,243040,244560,new generation but what we're seeing
qzUCPoLWbu8,244560,248239,today is the standard wheelbase version
qzUCPoLWbu8,248239,250560,as we continue on you can see that the
qzUCPoLWbu8,250560,253519,floating roof line has made a return for
qzUCPoLWbu8,253519,255760,this next generation model it does look
qzUCPoLWbu8,255760,257519,a little bit different i like the way
qzUCPoLWbu8,257519,259919,this kind of darkened chrome bleeds
qzUCPoLWbu8,259919,261680,through the back here and lengthens this
qzUCPoLWbu8,261680,264000,out a little bit and the tail light also
qzUCPoLWbu8,264000,266639,kind of comes into the side with a cool
qzUCPoLWbu8,266639,267840,design
qzUCPoLWbu8,267840,271759,kind of a striped look to it
qzUCPoLWbu8,272639,274560,and then of course as we move to the
qzUCPoLWbu8,274560,276320,rear design we're seeing a lot of big
qzUCPoLWbu8,276320,279680,changes here as you've seen with the nx
qzUCPoLWbu8,279680,282560,the new lx we've got a new lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,282560,284080,signature design
qzUCPoLWbu8,284080,285759,two elements are essential to that
qzUCPoLWbu8,285759,288479,that's the fact that we don't have the
qzUCPoLWbu8,288479,290240,l-shaped badge we actually have lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,290240,292080,spelled out across the back the other
qzUCPoLWbu8,292080,294720,big element is the long wide full-length
qzUCPoLWbu8,294720,296400,led tail lights that you see on board so
qzUCPoLWbu8,296400,298000,as you can tell these go all the way
qzUCPoLWbu8,298000,299600,across the back
qzUCPoLWbu8,299600,300400,and
qzUCPoLWbu8,300400,301759,continue to have that really cool
qzUCPoLWbu8,301759,303360,three-dimensional look it's not just an
qzUCPoLWbu8,303360,305680,appearance the actual tail light itself
qzUCPoLWbu8,305680,307440,is three-dimensional
qzUCPoLWbu8,307440,309520,which is something i really enjoyed on a
qzUCPoLWbu8,309520,312800,lot of the most recent lexus products
qzUCPoLWbu8,312800,314400,now as far as some other design elements
qzUCPoLWbu8,314400,316639,i'm noticing around of course you do
qzUCPoLWbu8,316639,318479,have special badging to tell you that
qzUCPoLWbu8,318479,321360,you've got the special version of the rx
qzUCPoLWbu8,321360,323840,or the most performance oriented version
qzUCPoLWbu8,323840,326240,additionally down here at the bottom
qzUCPoLWbu8,326240,327600,you're going to have that performance
qzUCPoLWbu8,327600,329919,mesh that's going to run down here
qzUCPoLWbu8,329919,331120,i do want to point out you're not going
qzUCPoLWbu8,331120,333039,to have any exposed exhaust pipes on any
qzUCPoLWbu8,333039,334720,of the models even this performance
qzUCPoLWbu8,334720,336560,oriented trim level
qzUCPoLWbu8,336560,338960,this is 2022 after all kind of exhaust
qzUCPoLWbu8,338960,341280,pipes are going out of style as we move
qzUCPoLWbu8,341280,343360,towards you know a zero emissions
qzUCPoLWbu8,343360,345039,feature and of course this is a hybrid
qzUCPoLWbu8,345039,347120,model even though it is a performance
qzUCPoLWbu8,347120,350520,hybrid model
qzUCPoLWbu8,352000,354320,hey guys so the sun went down on us a
qzUCPoLWbu8,354320,356479,little bit prematurely so this interior
qzUCPoLWbu8,356479,359199,is very dark and i do apologize for that
qzUCPoLWbu8,359199,361440,hopefully we will be able to have a more
qzUCPoLWbu8,361440,363360,detailed video in the daylight where you
qzUCPoLWbu8,363360,364560,might be able to see the interior a
qzUCPoLWbu8,364560,366160,little bit better but i do want to talk
qzUCPoLWbu8,366160,367520,about some of the feature highlights as
qzUCPoLWbu8,367520,369199,well some of the materials and i am
qzUCPoLWbu8,369199,370319,going to have to keep it brief because
qzUCPoLWbu8,370319,371759,the last shuttle out of this place is
qzUCPoLWbu8,371759,373360,leaving in a few minutes so this is
qzUCPoLWbu8,373360,374960,going to be a brief look at it all right
qzUCPoLWbu8,374960,377440,so let's talk about the materials first
qzUCPoLWbu8,377440,379120,up top we do have a really nice soft
qzUCPoLWbu8,379120,381120,touch plastic as you can see right here
qzUCPoLWbu8,381120,382639,this is all going to be a nice little
qzUCPoLWbu8,382639,384720,rep material we have a unique trim
qzUCPoLWbu8,384720,386720,piecing through here and i'm also
qzUCPoLWbu8,386720,389360,noticing we have alcantara on the door
qzUCPoLWbu8,389360,391360,trim that goes all the way up onto the
qzUCPoLWbu8,391360,393280,dashboard so that's a really unique
qzUCPoLWbu8,393280,394960,touch and that's in addition to your
qzUCPoLWbu8,394960,397919,mark levinson speaker grill now as far
qzUCPoLWbu8,397919,399840,as other things going on inside this
qzUCPoLWbu8,399840,402319,cabin this is of course a very premium
qzUCPoLWbu8,402319,404479,cabin and unfortunately we don't have
qzUCPoLWbu8,404479,405919,the key in here to power on all the
qzUCPoLWbu8,405919,408240,electronics but we do have a really nice
qzUCPoLWbu8,408240,410319,leather steering wheel you can also see
qzUCPoLWbu8,410319,412240,that we do have a digital gauge cluster
qzUCPoLWbu8,412240,414560,here this is if i had to guess i assume
qzUCPoLWbu8,414560,416319,this is the same one that is on the all
qzUCPoLWbu8,416319,418080,new lexus nx which is a good thing
qzUCPoLWbu8,418080,420000,because it's a nice high resolution
qzUCPoLWbu8,420000,423120,display we also do have the steering
qzUCPoLWbu8,423120,425520,wheel we also have this right here this
qzUCPoLWbu8,425520,427199,is a sensor to monitor your eyes and
qzUCPoLWbu8,427199,428240,make sure you're paying attention to the
qzUCPoLWbu8,428240,430560,road for all the advanced safety systems
qzUCPoLWbu8,430560,432080,that this vehicle has
qzUCPoLWbu8,432080,432960,now
qzUCPoLWbu8,432960,435680,we also have a really nice red leather
qzUCPoLWbu8,435680,438000,interior on this model i assume you will
qzUCPoLWbu8,438000,440319,be able to get lexus's typical gamut of
qzUCPoLWbu8,440319,442400,interior color options so red for the f
qzUCPoLWbu8,442400,444880,sport you probably also able to get a
qzUCPoLWbu8,444880,447039,white color if you prefer that in
qzUCPoLWbu8,447039,448479,addition to that we'll talk about some
qzUCPoLWbu8,448479,450560,of the storage space before we conclude
qzUCPoLWbu8,450560,452560,this brief look at the cabin here it
qzUCPoLWbu8,452560,454880,folds out just like a lot of other lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,454880,457039,products does we have a nice felt line
qzUCPoLWbu8,457039,459599,center console here and it does open
qzUCPoLWbu8,459599,461360,from both sides which is a nice party
qzUCPoLWbu8,461360,463919,trick we have an electronic shifter here
qzUCPoLWbu8,463919,465840,and if i had the vehicle powered on you
qzUCPoLWbu8,465840,468400,would see that we have a 360 camera on
qzUCPoLWbu8,468400,471520,this large display now this is also the
qzUCPoLWbu8,471520,473520,a big point for the rx because they've
qzUCPoLWbu8,473520,475759,completely upgraded the technology for
qzUCPoLWbu8,475759,477919,this all new model as you would expect
qzUCPoLWbu8,477919,480319,you know toyota is throwing in a lot of
qzUCPoLWbu8,480319,482080,different things with this model so
qzUCPoLWbu8,482080,483599,we're gonna have a really easy to use
qzUCPoLWbu8,483599,485120,interface just like we've seen in the
qzUCPoLWbu8,485120,487520,all new lexus nx wireless carplay
qzUCPoLWbu8,487520,489680,wireless android auto as well is
qzUCPoLWbu8,489680,490720,included
qzUCPoLWbu8,490720,492319,you're also going to have all of your
qzUCPoLWbu8,492319,493680,functionalities that you're going to
qzUCPoLWbu8,493680,495599,expect like a integrated navigation
qzUCPoLWbu8,495599,496879,system as well and it's going to be
qzUCPoLWbu8,496879,499440,their more advanced dynamic navigation
qzUCPoLWbu8,499440,501840,up top we do have a panoramic moon roof
qzUCPoLWbu8,501840,504000,as well and we'll hop in the rear real
qzUCPoLWbu8,504000,507840,quick before we head out
qzUCPoLWbu8,509520,511280,all right guys so here's the rear seat
qzUCPoLWbu8,511280,512880,of the rx i don't know how much of this
qzUCPoLWbu8,512880,514240,you'll be able to see it's pretty dark
qzUCPoLWbu8,514240,515919,back here but i want to point out you
qzUCPoLWbu8,515919,518000,have a lot of room as you have with any
qzUCPoLWbu8,518000,519599,rx the seats are really comfortable and
qzUCPoLWbu8,519599,521360,here in the center we are going to have
qzUCPoLWbu8,521360,523760,some really fancy features we have
qzUCPoLWbu8,523760,525360,vents right here in the middle we also
qzUCPoLWbu8,525360,527279,have our own climate zones which is a
qzUCPoLWbu8,527279,528720,nice premium touch we're also going to
qzUCPoLWbu8,528720,531040,have heated and ventilated rear seats
qzUCPoLWbu8,531040,532880,that's a premium touch that we really
qzUCPoLWbu8,532880,534640,don't see on a lot of vehicles nowadays
qzUCPoLWbu8,534640,537440,we also have two usb type-c ports as
qzUCPoLWbu8,537440,538880,well now let's go ahead and check out
qzUCPoLWbu8,538880,541200,the cargo department
qzUCPoLWbu8,541200,543040,all right so let's check out the cargo
qzUCPoLWbu8,543040,545360,area
qzUCPoLWbu8,545839,547519,once again we don't have the exact specs
qzUCPoLWbu8,547519,549440,or measurements for this all new rx
qzUCPoLWbu8,549440,551279,however as you would expect you are
qzUCPoLWbu8,551279,552880,going to have a lot of space this is an
qzUCPoLWbu8,552880,555360,rx after all however you know lightroom
qzUCPoLWbu8,555360,557040,mentioned on the outside the actual
qzUCPoLWbu8,557040,559040,overall length has not improved much for
qzUCPoLWbu8,559040,561279,this generation that said the wheelbase
qzUCPoLWbu8,561279,563120,is up over two inches
qzUCPoLWbu8,563120,564560,so i would expect you have a really good
qzUCPoLWbu8,564560,566800,amount of cargo space back here and if
qzUCPoLWbu8,566800,568480,we lift up the cargo floor we do have a
qzUCPoLWbu8,568480,569760,spare tire
qzUCPoLWbu8,569760,571200,but that's going to pretty much wrap up
qzUCPoLWbu8,571200,573519,we're able to do right here today we
qzUCPoLWbu8,573519,575440,will have a more detailed video on our
qzUCPoLWbu8,575440,578480,channel hopefully soon
qzUCPoLWbu8,581120,583200,so with this next generation rx we are
qzUCPoLWbu8,583200,586160,moving into a future future where lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,586160,587839,is going to give you a lot of choices in
qzUCPoLWbu8,587839,590480,terms of powertrain both traditional and
qzUCPoLWbu8,590480,592880,more futuristic with hybrid and plug-in
qzUCPoLWbu8,592880,594399,hybrid options
qzUCPoLWbu8,594399,598160,so you're going to have a rx350 still
qzUCPoLWbu8,598160,598959,but
qzUCPoLWbu8,598959,601600,it's no longer going to come with that
qzUCPoLWbu8,601600,603519,3.5 v6 that you've probably been
qzUCPoLWbu8,603519,605440,familiar with over the last few years
qzUCPoLWbu8,605440,607519,we're now switching that out for a 2.4
qzUCPoLWbu8,607519,609440,liter turbo four-cylinder the same one
qzUCPoLWbu8,609440,611839,you might be familiar with that is also
qzUCPoLWbu8,611839,614000,available in the lexus nx that we
qzUCPoLWbu8,614000,616399,reviewed on our channel a couple months
qzUCPoLWbu8,616399,617760,ago
qzUCPoLWbu8,617760,620800,additionally after the rx 350 you have
qzUCPoLWbu8,620800,622720,the 350h that's going to be the
qzUCPoLWbu8,622720,624880,traditional hybrid option that's going
qzUCPoLWbu8,624880,627120,to have a 2.5 4 cylinder plus the
qzUCPoLWbu8,627120,629040,electric components on board there's
qzUCPoLWbu8,629040,632480,going to be a rx 450h plus that's going
qzUCPoLWbu8,632480,634640,to be a plug-in hybrid model no
qzUCPoLWbu8,634640,636240,information is available on that right
qzUCPoLWbu8,636240,637920,now though lexus will release some
qzUCPoLWbu8,637920,639760,information at a later date and then of
qzUCPoLWbu8,639760,641680,course you have what we're standing next
qzUCPoLWbu8,641680,645760,to right now this is the rx 500h as the
qzUCPoLWbu8,645760,647760,h implies of course this is a hybrid
qzUCPoLWbu8,647760,649200,powertrain but this is pairing the
qzUCPoLWbu8,649200,651040,hybrid powertrain
qzUCPoLWbu8,651040,654079,with the 2.4 liter turbo four cylinders
qzUCPoLWbu8,654079,655839,to give you the most power as well as
qzUCPoLWbu8,655839,657839,the most dynamic system because this is
qzUCPoLWbu8,657839,659279,actually not the same kind of hybrid
qzUCPoLWbu8,659279,661680,system as the rx350h
qzUCPoLWbu8,661680,663440,is going to be
qzUCPoLWbu8,663440,665200,as far as the important figures of
qzUCPoLWbu8,665200,666560,course you probably want to know what's
qzUCPoLWbu8,666560,670880,the horsepower 367 horsepower 406 pound
qzUCPoLWbu8,670880,672640,feet of torque so definitely very
qzUCPoLWbu8,672640,674720,powerful this is the actually the most
qzUCPoLWbu8,674720,677600,powerful rx ever made including more
qzUCPoLWbu8,677600,680560,powerful than the previous v6 450h
qzUCPoLWbu8,680560,682560,hybrid model but the other important
qzUCPoLWbu8,682560,684079,thing you probably want to know is the
qzUCPoLWbu8,684079,686320,fact that it does have a traditional
qzUCPoLWbu8,686320,688640,six-speed automatic transmission
qzUCPoLWbu8,688640,689600,for that
qzUCPoLWbu8,689600,692320,you know maximum um
qzUCPoLWbu8,692320,693839,traditional feel basically for the
qzUCPoLWbu8,693839,696160,performance model standard four-wheel
qzUCPoLWbu8,696160,697839,drive is the direct drive four-wheel
qzUCPoLWbu8,697839,700079,drive system and additionally that's
qzUCPoLWbu8,700079,702240,gonna get you to zero to 60 and a lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,702240,705519,estimated 5.9 seconds

qzUCPoLWbu8,729519,732079,interested in buying in the future
qzUCPoLWbu8,732079,733680,speaking of in the future we don't have

qzUCPoLWbu8,735519,737279,model yet we also don't have any
qzUCPoLWbu8,737279,739440,information in terms of a potential on
qzUCPoLWbu8,739440,742240,sale date as you know chips are kind of
qzUCPoLWbu8,742240,743600,a problem these days so no one really
qzUCPoLWbu8,743600,744959,wants to dedicate themselves to a
qzUCPoLWbu8,744959,746399,specific date
qzUCPoLWbu8,746399,748240,but we will update this video in the
