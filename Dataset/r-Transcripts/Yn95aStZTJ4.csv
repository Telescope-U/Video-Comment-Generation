Yn95aStZTJ4,9200,12080,buy the cheap watch people at 199 is a
Yn95aStZTJ4,12080,15040,good price those bezels are criminal
Yn95aStZTJ4,15040,17920,there's no way in 2022 you can continue
Yn95aStZTJ4,17920,19600,to sell it low starting price people
Yn95aStZTJ4,19600,21760,love that price it's on the 32-bit
Yn95aStZTJ4,21760,24240,architecture it would make so much more
Yn95aStZTJ4,24240,26560,possible with watch os if you just drop
Yn95aStZTJ4,26560,28800,the series 3. okay fine series 3 won't
Yn95aStZTJ4,28800,31519,get watchos 9 then oh thank god thank
Yn95aStZTJ4,31519,33680,you for listening i appreciate that so
Yn95aStZTJ4,33680,35120,you're not going to sell it anymore
Yn95aStZTJ4,35120,36960,that's not
Yn95aStZTJ4,36960,39920,what we said but you're not giving it
Yn95aStZTJ4,39920,42719,the new watchos why would you continue
Yn95aStZTJ4,42719,44719,to sell it even though it's running
Yn95aStZTJ4,44719,46800,watchos 8 low
Yn95aStZTJ4,46800,49360,starting price you can
Yn95aStZTJ4,49360,50079,no
Yn95aStZTJ4,50079,52079,you would you've never
Yn95aStZTJ4,52079,56000,oh my god let's begin
Yn95aStZTJ4,56719,59680,so i installed watchos 9 beta on my one
Yn95aStZTJ4,59680,61600,and only apple watch series 7. there's
Yn95aStZTJ4,61600,63680,been a lot of horror stories of watchos
Yn95aStZTJ4,63680,65920,beta's bricking devices and stuff but
Yn95aStZTJ4,65920,67920,i've honestly never had a problem which
Yn95aStZTJ4,67920,70080,is a dangerous way to look at things but
Yn95aStZTJ4,70080,72159,it's been running very stable for me
Yn95aStZTJ4,72159,74479,basically no bugs that i can register
Yn95aStZTJ4,74479,76320,other than the volume indicator sticks
Yn95aStZTJ4,76320,78240,around for a bit longer than it should
Yn95aStZTJ4,78240,79680,which is funny because it's pretty much
Yn95aStZTJ4,79680,82479,the only watchos beta bug i've had over
Yn95aStZTJ4,82479,84640,the years and for a developer beta it's
Yn95aStZTJ4,84640,86400,pretty dang stable the battery life has
Yn95aStZTJ4,86400,88479,been fine for me no massive bugs that
Yn95aStZTJ4,88479,89840,caused the whole watch to crash or
Yn95aStZTJ4,89840,91520,overheat or anything i just kept using
Yn95aStZTJ4,91520,93759,it like my normal watch no big deal but
Yn95aStZTJ4,93759,95520,as you guys know watchos 9 was not
Yn95aStZTJ4,95520,97920,particularly chocked full with new
Yn95aStZTJ4,97920,100159,updates and features so every year
Yn95aStZTJ4,100159,101920,whenever we get minor updates to the
Yn95aStZTJ4,101920,104000,watch like this i like diving into the
Yn95aStZTJ4,104000,106399,tiny details the not so big updates that
Yn95aStZTJ4,106399,108320,apple didn't talk too much about because
Yn95aStZTJ4,108320,109920,that's pretty much all you don't know
Yn95aStZTJ4,109920,112079,yet and those little differences can
Yn95aStZTJ4,112079,114159,stack up so it becomes easy to tell if
Yn95aStZTJ4,114159,115600,you're on the latest version or what
Yn95aStZTJ4,115600,117280,have you but just keep in mind these are
Yn95aStZTJ4,117280,119280,not massive features i'm not trying to
Yn95aStZTJ4,119280,120880,act like this is gonna totally change
Yn95aStZTJ4,120880,122640,the way you use your watch because these
Yn95aStZTJ4,122640,124799,are uh pretty dang minor so for one in
Yn95aStZTJ4,124799,126719,control center i don't know why they did
Yn95aStZTJ4,126719,128640,this but the battery percentage changed
Yn95aStZTJ4,128640,131520,to blue it's just blue uh it doesn't do
Yn95aStZTJ4,131520,133040,anything different it doesn't like
Yn95aStZTJ4,133040,134640,change color when you tap it or anything
Yn95aStZTJ4,134640,136400,they just change the percentage to blue
Yn95aStZTJ4,136400,138400,maybe that's a bug it doesn't feel like
Yn95aStZTJ4,138400,140480,a bug but that's something they offer
Yn95aStZTJ4,140480,142560,now another pretty big fundamental
Yn95aStZTJ4,142560,144319,change that i ran into recently which i
Yn95aStZTJ4,144319,146480,was not expecting is when you activate
Yn95aStZTJ4,146480,148720,you know water lock so that the display
Yn95aStZTJ4,148720,150720,doesn't become interactive but you want
Yn95aStZTJ4,150720,152879,to unlock the watch from water mode so
Yn95aStZTJ4,152879,154800,before you used to scroll the digital
Yn95aStZTJ4,154800,157120,crown up or down you kind of unlock it
Yn95aStZTJ4,157120,159760,now you press and hold the digital crown
Yn95aStZTJ4,159760,162080,because i guess siri would not be
Yn95aStZTJ4,162080,164959,activated anyway so i'm not sure how i
Yn95aStZTJ4,164959,166400,feel about this one is that actually
Yn95aStZTJ4,166400,168080,faster than just scrolling the digital
Yn95aStZTJ4,168080,169680,crown now you have to press and hold it
Yn95aStZTJ4,169680,172239,might take a tad longer than before but
Yn95aStZTJ4,172239,174560,maybe people were accidentally unlocking
Yn95aStZTJ4,174560,176560,their watch when it was in water lock
Yn95aStZTJ4,176560,179200,mode by accidentally brushing up against
Yn95aStZTJ4,179200,180640,the digital crown or something it's a
Yn95aStZTJ4,180640,181920,very bizarre change because it's
Yn95aStZTJ4,181920,183760,basically been that way ever since the
Yn95aStZTJ4,183760,186000,apple watch series 2 and now they've
Yn95aStZTJ4,186000,187840,finally fundamentally changed that and i
Yn95aStZTJ4,187840,189519,assume it's the same method with the
Yn95aStZTJ4,189519,191360,bedtime feature but i went several days
Yn95aStZTJ4,191360,192640,without noticing it and then i went
Yn95aStZTJ4,192640,194319,swimming and came out and i was like oh
Yn95aStZTJ4,194319,196400,the scroll doesn't work you have to
Yn95aStZTJ4,196400,198000,press and hold now a little bit weird
Yn95aStZTJ4,198000,200159,another more useful perk for apple watch
Yn95aStZTJ4,200159,202159,series 7 owners out there which i very
Yn95aStZTJ4,202159,203920,much appreciate is they're adding
Yn95aStZTJ4,203920,206560,predictive text to the qwerty keyboard
Yn95aStZTJ4,206560,208159,which actually helps a lot because i do
Yn95aStZTJ4,208159,209680,quite a bit of texting straight off of
Yn95aStZTJ4,209680,211440,that swipe keyboard and because the
Yn95aStZTJ4,211440,213120,keyboard is so small for the most part
Yn95aStZTJ4,213120,215519,i've got it down but occasionally i make
Yn95aStZTJ4,215519,217680,a mistake because i'm human and i will
Yn95aStZTJ4,217680,219760,swipe a word and it's incorrect but now
Yn95aStZTJ4,219760,221280,that you have two or three little
Yn95aStZTJ4,221280,223360,predictive text options there very
Yn95aStZTJ4,223360,224959,likely one of the times you spell it
Yn95aStZTJ4,224959,227519,wrong the correct word is right there as
Yn95aStZTJ4,227519,229440,a backup and it's very easy for me to
Yn95aStZTJ4,229440,231840,type even fairly long paragraphs and
Yn95aStZTJ4,231840,234000,continue conversations with people if my
Yn95aStZTJ4,234000,236159,phone is preoccupied or my phone is in
Yn95aStZTJ4,236159,238080,the other room it's not just because i'm
Yn95aStZTJ4,238080,240560,lazy sometimes you know my iphone is
Yn95aStZTJ4,240560,242640,being used for continuity camera on the
Yn95aStZTJ4,242640,244799,mac so if i want to text someone and be
Yn95aStZTJ4,244799,246799,using that webcam the apple watch is
Yn95aStZTJ4,246799,249200,helpful and useful at that so definitely
Yn95aStZTJ4,249200,250720,appreciate them adding that it's
Yn95aStZTJ4,250720,252640,definitely filling up the display a lot
Yn95aStZTJ4,252640,254480,and i think it's very hypocritical for
Yn95aStZTJ4,254480,256560,them to add the qwerty keyboard to the
Yn95aStZTJ4,256560,260160,41 millimeter watch but not the 42 or 44
Yn95aStZTJ4,260160,261840,millimeter watches out there like i
Yn95aStZTJ4,261840,264160,think personally this is as small as i'm
Yn95aStZTJ4,264160,265919,comfortable going with a qwerty keyboard
Yn95aStZTJ4,265919,267919,and this is the largest display apple's
Yn95aStZTJ4,267919,270000,ever put on a watch so i feel like if
Yn95aStZTJ4,270000,272000,they restricted it to this option their
Yn95aStZTJ4,272000,274160,logic would make sense but them software
Yn95aStZTJ4,274160,276000,locking it to the 41 and not bringing it
Yn95aStZTJ4,276000,277759,to the other watches that feels a bit
Yn95aStZTJ4,277759,279840,bizarre but i personally would not feel
Yn95aStZTJ4,279840,281280,comfortable typing with the qwerty
Yn95aStZTJ4,281280,283520,keyboard on a display any smaller than
Yn95aStZTJ4,283520,285199,this the other big change that i didn't
Yn95aStZTJ4,285199,287040,see them talk too much about during the
Yn95aStZTJ4,287040,289759,event but actually makes a really big
Yn95aStZTJ4,289759,291600,useful difference is the redesign
Yn95aStZTJ4,291600,294160,notification system so before if you are
Yn95aStZTJ4,294160,296160,actively using your watch and you got a
Yn95aStZTJ4,296160,297840,notification it would turn off the
Yn95aStZTJ4,297840,300080,entire display you get this big pop-up
Yn95aStZTJ4,300080,302320,that says hey you got a message and then
Yn95aStZTJ4,302320,303919,another animation with all the text and
Yn95aStZTJ4,303919,305360,who texted you which would kind of
Yn95aStZTJ4,305360,306720,interrupt you if you were in the middle
Yn95aStZTJ4,306720,308639,of something which because i checked my
Yn95aStZTJ4,308639,310560,emails and text people quite a bit on my
Yn95aStZTJ4,310560,312479,watch that was honestly kind of
Yn95aStZTJ4,312479,314720,intrusive but now much more similar to
Yn95aStZTJ4,314720,316320,an iphone if you're using the watch and
Yn95aStZTJ4,316320,317919,you get a notification it's just a
Yn95aStZTJ4,317919,320560,little drop down menu which i like and
Yn95aStZTJ4,320560,322560,you just swipe down from that and you
Yn95aStZTJ4,322560,324639,can instantly reply and start texting to
Yn95aStZTJ4,324639,326560,it that is much much faster than it was
Yn95aStZTJ4,326560,328960,before and if it's a non-important text
Yn95aStZTJ4,328960,330560,you can easily dismiss it and just
Yn95aStZTJ4,330560,332479,ignore it maybe that wasn't possible
Yn95aStZTJ4,332479,334720,with the 32-bit silicon in the apple
Yn95aStZTJ4,334720,336560,watch series 3. it's honestly funny
Yn95aStZTJ4,336560,338240,because all these changes are so small
Yn95aStZTJ4,338240,340000,but now they kill the series 3. i don't
Yn95aStZTJ4,340000,342160,know why the three couldn't do any of
Yn95aStZTJ4,342160,343680,these things but i don't care they need
Yn95aStZTJ4,343680,345600,to stop selling the series 3 regardless
Yn95aStZTJ4,345600,347919,so stop supporting it and ideally don't
Yn95aStZTJ4,347919,349759,take money for that watch anymore apple
Yn95aStZTJ4,349759,351759,this is ridiculous another change they
Yn95aStZTJ4,351759,353440,made that i actually found myself
Yn95aStZTJ4,353440,355440,appreciating is that if there are apps
Yn95aStZTJ4,355440,357680,running in the background they rearrange
Yn95aStZTJ4,357680,359919,them in the dock now so that little side
Yn95aStZTJ4,359919,361840,button that you press to switch between
Yn95aStZTJ4,361840,364400,apps will keep apps that are actively
Yn95aStZTJ4,364400,366479,running or doing something pinned so for
Yn95aStZTJ4,366479,368800,instance a stopwatch if you're clocking
Yn95aStZTJ4,368800,370400,something for an extended period of time
Yn95aStZTJ4,370400,372720,but you also want to do a workout and
Yn95aStZTJ4,372720,374800,then you want to activate the bedtime
Yn95aStZTJ4,374800,376639,feature or you take the watch off and
Yn95aStZTJ4,376639,378080,charge it for hours and hours i've been
Yn95aStZTJ4,378080,380560,running a stopwatch since yesterday and
Yn95aStZTJ4,380560,382639,because it's active it keeps it pinned
Yn95aStZTJ4,382639,384560,in the background and running despite me
Yn95aStZTJ4,384560,387120,doing workouts and the bedtime stuff and
Yn95aStZTJ4,387120,389120,charging it overnight it just kept it
Yn95aStZTJ4,389120,391919,pinned and it doesn't auto close so who
Yn95aStZTJ4,391919,393840,knew the apple watch is actually pretty
Yn95aStZTJ4,393840,395840,dang good at managing multitasking
Yn95aStZTJ4,395840,398319,despite having no virtual memory swap at
Yn95aStZTJ4,398319,399680,this point i wouldn't be surprised if
Yn95aStZTJ4,399680,401440,the apple watch got stage manager before
Yn95aStZTJ4,401440,404080,the a12x ipad pros do but of course
Yn95aStZTJ4,404080,406160,there's a handful of new watch faces
Yn95aStZTJ4,406160,407440,which i appreciate they're kind of
Yn95aStZTJ4,407440,409440,colorful and give you a lot of data and
Yn95aStZTJ4,409440,411360,some interesting information but yeah as
Yn95aStZTJ4,411360,413759,far as watch os goes those are most of
Yn95aStZTJ4,413759,415360,the changes that i don't see that many
Yn95aStZTJ4,415360,417120,people talking about obviously you guys
Yn95aStZTJ4,417120,419280,already know about the activity updates
Yn95aStZTJ4,419280,420560,because that's pretty much all they
Yn95aStZTJ4,420560,422560,talked about in the watchos section of
Yn95aStZTJ4,422560,423840,the keynote so that's what i've
Yn95aStZTJ4,423840,425520,discovered is there anything else out
Yn95aStZTJ4,425520,427199,there that you guys ran into that you
Yn95aStZTJ4,427199,429039,were like oh i wasn't expecting them to
Yn95aStZTJ4,429039,430960,update this or change that so all that
Yn95aStZTJ4,430960,431759,good stuff let me know what you're
Yn95aStZTJ4,431759,433120,thinking down in the comments below this
Yn95aStZTJ4,433120,434240,is your apple sweep here i'll see you
Yn95aStZTJ4,434240,437720,all in the next one
Yn95aStZTJ4,437820,440949,[Music]
