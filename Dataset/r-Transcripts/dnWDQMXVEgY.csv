dnWDQMXVEgY,18960,20699,Pull your feelings out of it.

dnWDQMXVEgY,31999,35200,your calling your passion
dnWDQMXVEgY,35200,37870,you can't draw back when life gets tough.
dnWDQMXVEgY,37870,40750,You've got to stand up to it and push.
dnWDQMXVEgY,40750,44660,Push through it.
dnWDQMXVEgY,44660,48300,Tragedy and trials come to everybody only the strong survive.
dnWDQMXVEgY,48300,53000,You gotta have that gut strength that belly strength
dnWDQMXVEgY,53000,57190,that devil defying come hell or high water strength
dnWDQMXVEgY,57190,61140,that inner-strength that when I can't do as I would
dnWDQMXVEgY,61140,64448,I'm gonna do as I can but I'm not gonna stop doing.
dnWDQMXVEgY,64448,67130,If you start something you're gonna finish it.
dnWDQMXVEgY,67130,68130,Make a way.
dnWDQMXVEgY,68130,71618,"Figure it out, adjust, pivot have a certain level of mental agility"
dnWDQMXVEgY,71619,73719,and get it done.
dnWDQMXVEgY,73719,74770,Keep going.
dnWDQMXVEgY,74770,75819,Press on.
dnWDQMXVEgY,75819,77380,This too shall pass.
dnWDQMXVEgY,77380,80880,There's nothing that we come up against that's stronger than anything that we possess
dnWDQMXVEgY,80880,81880,internally.
dnWDQMXVEgY,81880,82910,I haven't had my best idea yet.
dnWDQMXVEgY,82911,85859,I haven't had my most creative moment yet.
dnWDQMXVEgY,85859,88200,I haven't produced my dream yet.
dnWDQMXVEgY,88200,91200,"I don't care whether you're 30, 40, 50, 60, 70"
dnWDQMXVEgY,91200,94218,there's something down inside of you that's still kicking
dnWDQMXVEgY,94219,97659,inside of you that wants to get out and it wants to live.
dnWDQMXVEgY,97659,102960,When you start running from one thing you're gonna keep running from everything.
dnWDQMXVEgY,102960,107760,You're gonna run from love you're gonna run from life
dnWDQMXVEgY,107760,111719,"you're gonna run from responsibility you're gonna run, run, run, run, run"
dnWDQMXVEgY,111719,114270,when are you gonna stop running?
dnWDQMXVEgY,114270,119560,You don't know what you've got until all hell breaks loose.
dnWDQMXVEgY,119560,124968,You don't know what you can take until the pressure is applied to your life.
dnWDQMXVEgY,124969,129490,You don't know what you can endure until people stab you in the back
dnWDQMXVEgY,129490,130920,and walk away from you.
dnWDQMXVEgY,130920,134030,You don't know how much courage you have until you've been under fire
dnWDQMXVEgY,134030,136400,and under struggle and under tribulation.
dnWDQMXVEgY,136400,142640,If there's any fear in your spirit right now it ain't for you.
dnWDQMXVEgY,142640,143640,"This sh*t for warriors, man."
dnWDQMXVEgY,143640,144640,"This sh*t for soldiers, man."
dnWDQMXVEgY,144640,147970,And the reason why most of you are not successful is because every single time
dnWDQMXVEgY,147970,149950,stuff not going your way you give up
dnWDQMXVEgY,149950,151190,you quit you let go
dnWDQMXVEgY,151190,153200,and people feel weakness they feel it.
dnWDQMXVEgY,153200,157300,You can feel when somebody's not committed when they're not all in
dnWDQMXVEgY,157300,158780,when they're not dedicated.
dnWDQMXVEgY,158780,161780,And there's another level you get to when you go all in.
dnWDQMXVEgY,161780,163610,I want what other men want.
dnWDQMXVEgY,163610,166280,But when the pressure hits when the opposition hits
dnWDQMXVEgY,166280,168760,when the challenge hits when the pain creeps in
dnWDQMXVEgY,168760,171310,"when the uncertainty creeps in when the cuts, when the scars"
dnWDQMXVEgY,171310,175090,when the bruises come I just want a little bit more than they want
dnWDQMXVEgY,175090,176090,it.
dnWDQMXVEgY,176090,178370,That's how I conquer and that's how nobody has ever beaten me yet.
dnWDQMXVEgY,178370,182489,I have never met anybody who became incredibly successful
dnWDQMXVEgY,182490,184700,until they have suffered and sweated
dnWDQMXVEgY,184700,187680,and sacrificed and kept their focus
dnWDQMXVEgY,187680,190879,and fought through tears and trials and tests
dnWDQMXVEgY,190880,193850,and if you have a dream and you commit to it
dnWDQMXVEgY,193850,197710,it will come to pass.
dnWDQMXVEgY,197710,201750,There's something that you could do that would radically change your life.
dnWDQMXVEgY,201750,204670,Somebody could take the hand you've been dealt
dnWDQMXVEgY,204670,206130,and win with it.
dnWDQMXVEgY,206130,208010,Same circumstances same ideas.
dnWDQMXVEgY,208010,210470,They would do it through what they thought about your life.
dnWDQMXVEgY,210470,212480,But we don't need somebody 'cause we got you.
dnWDQMXVEgY,212480,213379,You are the one.
