sOjKF1Xvtnk,150,2070,- Which desserts make your wallet hurts?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,2070,3869,- Let's talk about that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,3869,6451,(groovy music)
sOjKF1Xvtnk,11790,13410,Good mythical morning.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,13410,14910,"- You know, sometimes when I go out to eat,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,14910,17310,I like to be a bad boy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,17310,18599,- I know what he means by that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,18600,20553,It's not sniffing the waiter.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,21480,22680,I meant to say stiffing the waiter.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,22680,24240,"- Yeah, it's neither one of those things."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,24240,26789,Being a bad boy means I get a decadent dessert
sOjKF1Xvtnk,26790,28260,"after a decadent meal, but-"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,28260,30390,"- Don't be a bad boy, stop sniffing the waiter."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,30390,32489,- But just because I'm a bad boy in my belly
sOjKF1Xvtnk,32490,35130,doesn't mean I want to be a bad boy in my bank.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,35130,35963,- Nope.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,35963,37020,- Are the desserts at restaurants
sOjKF1Xvtnk,37020,38490,really worth their price points
sOjKF1Xvtnk,38490,40200,or am I better off being a bad boy
sOjKF1Xvtnk,40200,41630,in my local freezer section?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,41630,42960,"Ha ha, we're gonna find out."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,42960,47960,"It's time for Naked Foods, Naked Desserts Edition: Naked."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,48240,49950,- We're about to try four different desserts
sOjKF1Xvtnk,49950,51660,"from four different price points,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,51660,54300,"the freezer section or bakery of a grocery store,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,54300,57059,"fast casual restaurants, sit down restaurants"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,57060,59730,and fine dining establishments.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,59730,61620,"- Each round, we're gonna pick our favorite dessert"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,61620,62453,from the lineup.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,62453,65190,"Then, Stevie will reveal where each dessert is from."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,65190,66023,how much it costs.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,66023,66856,"And by the end, we're gonna know"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,66856,69120,just how much our ideal desserts cost.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,69120,70683,- Bring on the sweets.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,72570,75030,- These are cheesecakes.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,75030,77820,"And that one over here, we're gonna try first."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,77820,78933,"It looks like,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,80280,81930,has it been flambeed?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,81930,84963,And it's crust is blueberries? - Nonexistent.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,85950,87570,You know that this is the fancy one.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,87570,89340,I went to a fancy place one time and they did this
sOjKF1Xvtnk,89340,90960,and I was upset because the crust
sOjKF1Xvtnk,90960,92610,is the best part of a cheesecake.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,93690,95430,- I love the crust.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,95430,96450,- It tastes good though.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,96450,98159,- It's very thick.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,98160,99750,That's good but I'm missing the crust.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,99750,101774,"Now this one, number two."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,101774,103710,Doesn't have crust up the back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,103710,104760,It's just got a little dusting.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,104760,106350,- You gotta have crust up the back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,106350,108650,- I love a good crust just up the back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,108650,110670,- Of course if you get crust off your back
sOjKF1Xvtnk,110670,113970,"after certain activities, you should shower."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,113970,115770,- Yeah if you got a crusty back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,115770,117750,This is nothing to speak of.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,117750,119520,- Bland. - Bland.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,119520,120840,"- It's bland, isn't it?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,120840,121673,- Welcome to the
sOjKF1Xvtnk,121673,122506,"land of bland. - Okay, now look,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,122506,123689,there we go. - Crust up the back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,123690,125130,- Crust up the back and I gotta get some.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,125130,126360,That's where I'm go for right there.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,126360,127320,"Boom, get that crust."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,127320,129692,"- Yep and I'm gonna get that other crust, boom."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,133590,135720,"- The crust is better, but the cheesecake is a little"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,135720,136553,- Oily.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,137580,139530,- I love cheesecake and I haven't had a good time yet.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,139530,141360,- It's a weird taste.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,141360,142680,- It's getting worse.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,142680,143512,"What's happening, Link?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,143513,145980,- There's some sort of like vanilla-ey thing in there.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,145980,147629,"- So far, this one's the best one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,147630,150144,- Crust three quarters of the way up the back.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,150144,151030,- Oh and this
sOjKF1Xvtnk,152022,152855,is a thick daddy. - Dive in on this side.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,152855,153900,- I'm gonna go through here.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,153900,155993,- You're making me go backwards on this one.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,159510,160653,- This one's custardy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,161940,162930,- Dang it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,162930,164939,- That one is so thick.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,164940,166770,"All right, we gotta vote, Rhett."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,166770,167603,You gotta vote.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,167603,168480,You gotta go with your instincts.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,168480,170819,"You know, you just gotta go, which one did you like?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,170820,172050,"Don't overthink it. - Very nicely,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,172050,173790,"three, two, one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,174670,175709,"- Dude, I hate to say it,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,175710,178380,the cheesecake on this one is so much better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,178380,181560,"- It's great, but there's no crust, unacceptable."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,183097,186000,"- [Stevie] So Link, you chose the casual sit down"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,186000,188220,which of course is Cheesecake Factory
sOjKF1Xvtnk,188220,189450,for $8.95. - It's good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,189450,192330,"- So good, classic with the sour cream on top."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,192330,195030,"- [Stevie] But Rhett, get those dancing shoes on,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,195030,197676,mister fancy pants.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,197676,198870,(gentle piano music)
sOjKF1Xvtnk,198870,201183,- I wish that it had crust.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,202290,205950,Could you believe how good it would be
sOjKF1Xvtnk,205950,209129,if the crust was a must?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,209130,212340,- Now we get a lot of feedback on Mooshell.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,212340,213840,"Matter of fact, throw this tweet up here."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,213840,215448,I want to read this thing.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,215449,217897,"WeezReaper tweeted,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,217897,222660,"""I'll believe that Mooshell is not Chase in a costume"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,222660,227400,when Chance does a fancy pants dance with Mooshell.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,227400,229409,"- Oh, so all it's gonna take"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,229410,234410,is if Chance dances with Mooshell.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,234477,235980,- For WheezReaper to believe
sOjKF1Xvtnk,235980,237629,that it's not Chase in a costume.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,237630,240930,"- So all we gotta do is get Chance, the office dog,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,240930,242670,to dance with Mooshell.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,242670,244319,That can be arranged.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,244320,245358,- Go for it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,245358,248441,(gentle piano music)
sOjKF1Xvtnk,250050,251920,- That can't be Chase
sOjKF1Xvtnk,253140,257430,because Mooshell is dancing with Chance.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,257430,258299,"- Hello, Chance."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,258299,259979,"Come here, baby."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,259980,261875,"Come here, baby."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,261875,262708,Yes.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,263610,265919,"Yes, you don't know me that well."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,265920,267483,"- Bite him, bite him."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,269250,270083,- [Stevie] Okay so yeah.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,270083,275083,So the fine dining cheesecake is from Morton's for $13.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,275668,277080,- Morton. - Cheesecake flavor's good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,277080,280740,- We also have fast casual from Jack in the Box
sOjKF1Xvtnk,280740,282300,which is next in line
sOjKF1Xvtnk,282300,283919,"for $3.49. - Jack in the Box, no flavor."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,283920,287340,"- [Stevie] And frozen, Target's Favorite Day"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,287340,292169,"New York style cheesecake, it's $1.54 per slice."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,292170,293013,- Weird.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,295230,297600,These are apple pies.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,297600,299581,"- Oh, I'm excited. - Let's start down here."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,299581,300414,"- Now before you eat this,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,300414,301247,I do want to let you know.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,301247,302408,- What?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,302408,303241,Let me know.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,303241,305370,"- That David just came over and pointed out that this pie,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,305370,306510,"we got two slices of pie,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,306510,307590,"we always have backup pie,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,307590,309449,it came from the same place
sOjKF1Xvtnk,309450,310983,and it had this on it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,312360,313193,- What?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,313193,314026,- Mold.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,314026,314859,- What the crap?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,314859,315692,I've already eaten it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,315692,317849,"- No, the one that you're eating didn't have mold on it"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,317850,318690,but it's from the same place
sOjKF1Xvtnk,318690,320790,and it's the same pie. - Did you look?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,320790,321623,- [Nicole] What?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,321623,322456,"- Did you look, Nicole?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,322456,323289,"There's no mold on this one, right?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,323289,324210,- [Nicole] Obviously.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,324210,325949,"- Yeah, right, what you think Nicole's gonna do to you?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,325950,327210,Nothing.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,327210,329340,- I didn't taste any mold.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,329340,330990,It's very mushy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,330990,332340,I like a apple pie
sOjKF1Xvtnk,332340,334540,"where the apples aren't too crunchy, though."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,335460,336509,So that's not bad.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,336510,337855,I would eat more but-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,337855,338880,- The crust is pretty good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,338880,340863,- I don't love the idea of eating mold.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,341730,343080,I think that's a demerit.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,343080,346800,- This has gotten frozen section written all ovit.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,346800,347634,- [Link] Ovit?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,347635,350190,"- Two syllables, I moved 'em around in my sentence."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,350190,353730,"- Ooh, the apples in this actually taste like apples."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,353730,354563,- You don't like that?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,354563,355432,- I don't like that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,357564,360180,- You say something that makes total sense to you
sOjKF1Xvtnk,360180,363275,and sounds like a crazy person to everyone else.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,363275,364680,That's not great.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,364680,366270,- I think it's worse than that one.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,366270,367530,"- This one's worse than that one, yeah."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,367530,368749,- Yeah.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,368749,369582,- The moldy one's better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,369582,370415,- The moldy one's better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,370415,371248,- This one's crispy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,371248,374913,- This one looks like it's got a buttery top on it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,375960,379600,"Now, I'm operating under the thesis in this episode that"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,380790,383850,the most expensive desserts are not worth it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,383850,385450,- I thought I was gonna say that
sOjKF1Xvtnk,386753,388710,but the first round threw me for a loop.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,388710,390180,- 'Cause there's something about having like-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,390180,391013,- [Rhett] That's pretty good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,391013,394710,"- The down home, approachable, not overpriced dessert."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,394710,396600,- Dessert shouldn't have to be expensive to be good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,396600,398490,It's not like you're paying for like a better piece of meat.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,398490,399323,- There's plenty of times
sOjKF1Xvtnk,399323,401639,when I'm out to dinner at a nice place and I'm like
sOjKF1Xvtnk,401640,403440,I'm gonna opt to not get dessert
sOjKF1Xvtnk,403440,405780,because I'm just gonna go home and eat some ice cream
sOjKF1Xvtnk,405780,407910,and it'll be better than this and it'll be later
sOjKF1Xvtnk,407910,409320,so my food will digest.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,409320,411250,"I'll eat some cereal, two bowls"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,412380,413820,and that'll be even better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,413820,415709,- I was on board with the first half of your-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,415709,416573,- And $25 for a torte?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,417505,419640,What is this? - Don't get the torte.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,419640,422218,This is obviously from a fancy place
sOjKF1Xvtnk,422218,423237,but is it good?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,423238,424710,- [Link] This is an entire pie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,424710,425919,- I can't see.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,425919,426752,There you go.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,426752,427752,- Can't see?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,431220,434880,"- Okay well, it's pretty dang good, maybe it's worth it."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,434880,436560,- Very cinnamony.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,436560,437749,- Cinnamwhat?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,437749,439020,- Cinnamoniny?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,439020,441810,- Now I'm leaving out syllables.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,441810,444180,I'm gonna go back here for a second.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,444180,446793,- [Stevie] We call it cinnawoman in my house.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,448199,451029,- It's very cinnawomany.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,451029,452362,- Cinnofawomany.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,453220,454809,Hooha!
sOjKF1Xvtnk,454809,455642,- Hooha.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,456628,458983,"It's not hooha, it's hoowa."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,458984,462963,It's whatever the Marines say.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,464640,466140,"- [Stevie] Three, two, one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,466140,466973,- I think-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,466973,468300,"- Yeah, that one's the best."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,468300,469979,- This one's the best.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,469980,470813,"- That crumbly stuff is,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,470813,472889,now that one's good but this is so crumbly and nice.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,472890,474863,"- Too fancy, too fancy."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,474863,476464,"- [Stevie] All right, you both have chosen"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,476464,478590,our casual sit down which is House of Pies
sOjKF1Xvtnk,478590,480660,and a slice of pie- - It's a whole house of pies.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,480660,482520,- Was $4.75.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,482520,483389,I actually thought
sOjKF1Xvtnk,483390,485670,so the last one is obviously the fine dining one
sOjKF1Xvtnk,485670,487440,'cause it looks the prettiest.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,487440,491070,It's from Arroyo Chop House and it's $11
sOjKF1Xvtnk,491070,493770,which honestly that's not a bad price
sOjKF1Xvtnk,493770,495123,for that particular pie. - You get a whole pie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,495123,496979,- That is not bad.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,496980,500340,- Our moldy pie is from Boston Market.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,500340,501633,- Not bad Boston Market.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,502710,503543,- There's mold on the way.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,503543,505020,- Clear up that mold sit
sOjKF1Xvtnk,505020,506910,and then you got yourself a decent pie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,506910,509670,- [Stevie] And then our frozen is from Walmart
sOjKF1Xvtnk,509670,511890,and it's 99 cents per slice.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,511890,514020,"- Yeah, tastes too much like apple."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,514020,514853,- Mm.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,515820,518013,These are tiramisi.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,520740,523620,"- Look at, oh, we got ourselves a cups."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,523620,525480,- We got ourselves a cup.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,525480,526440,Look at that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,526440,527310,And what's that on top?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,527310,528570,- But there's no layers.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,528570,529920,It's just got a-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,529920,531570,"- Now listen, don't inhale too hard"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,531570,533220,when you eat tiramisi
sOjKF1Xvtnk,533220,538079,because you could choke yourself on the stuff on the top.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,538080,539370,- Little cinnamon challenge action.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,539370,540330,"- Oh, there is a flavor."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,540330,541163,I mean there is a layer.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,541163,544440,You just gotta go deep to get to this espresso.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,544440,545700,"- Oh, is that what that is?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,545700,547410,"Espresso, I forgot."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,547410,548759,- That's what makes tiramisu great.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,548760,550650,- I was wondering what that juice was.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,550650,552780,"- Hold on, can I just show you the top of that?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,552780,553770,- Isn't that beautiful?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,553770,555407,- Look at that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,555407,560407,- It looks like a toolbox in the back of my pickup truck.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,560580,562020,- The old diamond studded thing.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,562020,562853,- Diamond studded toolbox.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,562853,565530,- I like a bathroom floor like this.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,565530,567240,- It looks like a bathroom floor
sOjKF1Xvtnk,567240,570243,that my guy with the toolbox built for me.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,573690,574623,Three layers.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,576660,577493,"- No, sir."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,578700,582810,"All looks, very shallow."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,582810,584640,Nothing to write home about.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,584640,586380,This is a one night stand.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,586380,590190,"- Yeah, it's kind of a, it's kind of bland."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,590190,591870,This one is honking large.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,591870,592766,- [Rhett] That is a cake.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,592767,594573,- But this is so weird.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,596389,597806,I mean all of that there is cake.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,597806,599400,- It's like it came from a sheet.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,599400,603420,"It's like tiramisu for a camp, a children's camp."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,603420,604649,"- Yes, exactly."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,604650,606360,"- Oh, I gotta bring out the big pan again."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,606360,607560,- Make it a sheet cake.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,607560,609963,"- He's making the floor, I'm making the cake."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,612870,613890,- This is not-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,613890,614760,- That's cornbread.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,614760,616650,- It's not even a thing.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,616650,617940,"- Seriously, it's cornbread."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,617940,619410,- This is more like tiramisight.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,619410,620243,- Oh!
sOjKF1Xvtnk,622020,624030,"- I mean I could keep eating it, it's not bad."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,624030,625050,- It's just not tiramisu.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,625050,626640,- It's not.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,626640,627750,- [Rhett] Now this is interesting.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,627750,629130,"Ooh, that's got a nice little consistency."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,629130,630660,- And then if you look in there
sOjKF1Xvtnk,630660,632970,what we've done is we've revealed
sOjKF1Xvtnk,632970,637233,a very espresso drenched bottom layer.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,639917,643589,- If you gave me that at an Italian restaurant.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,643590,644700,- Can I gave it to you?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,644700,646143,- I wouldn't argue.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,647280,649350,But this is what I really want right here.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,649350,650850,I'm coming back to this.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,650850,651779,- Let me try that.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,651780,652773,- Do you see that?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,653850,657930,"There's so much espresso in the bottom of that,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,657930,659520,maybe too much.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,659520,662160,- Yeah and it's more of a pudding experience.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,662160,665399,They're taking liberties with it but-
sOjKF1Xvtnk,665400,667620,"- [Stevie] Three, two, one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,668520,670260,- I almost want to go here
sOjKF1Xvtnk,670260,671733,but I got to go here.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,672583,675420,"- [Stevie] Ah, little agreement again I see."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,675420,680420,- We have consummate tastes in desserts.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,680970,682019,- It might not be the fanciest one
sOjKF1Xvtnk,682020,683280,but it's the best one.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,683280,684780,"- [Stevie] It is from our,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,684780,686760,what we're calling our fast casual place.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,686760,687780,It's Porto's
sOjKF1Xvtnk,687780,691023,"which we all know and love. - Porto's is so good, man."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,691023,692367,They know what they're doing.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,692367,694770,- You line up and the line is always way too long.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,694770,695970,You get a (indistinct).
sOjKF1Xvtnk,695970,697529,- These little things like this
sOjKF1Xvtnk,697530,698970,"and yeah, it's just they do it right."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,698970,700379,- It's got a cafeteria vibe.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,700380,701700,That's why it's in the cup.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,701700,702533,- [Stevie] Not bad.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,702533,705510,One of those will run you $3.85.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,705510,710250,"Then of course the really nice looking one is from,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,710250,712533,"no, no the next one in line,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,714450,718027,is from Bottega Louie for $14.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,721050,722459,"- I love that place, man."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,722460,724440,I love Bottega Louie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,724440,726364,"- [Stevie] Okay, well you didn't love it this time."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,726364,727440,- But I haven't had their tiramisu.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,727440,729030,"- [Stevie] Not when it's naked, you don't like it."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,729030,730681,"- They let us down, man."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,730681,733740,- Then we have our frozen from again Walmart.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,733740,738286,"This is Walmart's Freshness Guaranteed tiramisu cake,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,738286,739590,$2.98.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,739590,741030,- I guarantee you it's cornbread.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,741030,742560,"You might think that it's tiramisu,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,742560,745860,like somebody missed the boat there.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,745860,746820,"- [Stevie] And then finally,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,746820,751633,"we have our casual sit down, Olive Garden, for $9.29."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,752580,754080,- Olive Garden is bringing the tiramisu.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,754080,756660,- Olive Garden is not gonna play.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,756660,757769,- They're never gonna play.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,757770,759570,- They're gonna be serious about it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,760890,761940,"At the top of this episode,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,761940,763920,you talked about being a bad boy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,763920,764753,- Yeah.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,764753,765720,"- Well, we were bad boys."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,765720,768120,"We made an episode of Good Mythical Morning,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,768120,771570,it's an annual tradition now that was banned from YouTube.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,771570,774300,YouTube would not allow us to make the episode
sOjKF1Xvtnk,774300,775500,that we wanted to release today.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,775500,776520,So you know what?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,776520,777630,Screw it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,777630,780540,We released it exclusively on the Mythical Society
sOjKF1Xvtnk,780540,782160,and you can go over there and watch it now
sOjKF1Xvtnk,782160,783690,and you don't have to pay anything.

sOjKF1Xvtnk,785160,787350,that's the free tier of the Mythical Society.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,787350,791579,"You get to watch the band episode fresh, hot off the presses"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,791580,792780,of Good Mythical Morning.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,792780,794160,"- You're telling me I can watch it for free, man?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,794160,796920,"- Yeah, just be an initiate of the Mythical Society"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,796920,797970,or any of the tiers.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,797970,799110,- Do I have to go through like initiation
sOjKF1Xvtnk,799110,800714,"or are you gonna like gimme a wedgie, man?"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,800714,801779,- All you got to do is sign up
sOjKF1Xvtnk,801780,805113,and then we also did a banned Good Mythical More.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,806010,807510,- This just keeps getting better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,807510,810510,- That you have to be in another tier.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,810510,811650,Which tier is it?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,811650,812483,Another one.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,812483,813316,- Another tier?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,813316,815073,"- You can find out when you go over there,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,815073,816779,mythicalsociety.com.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,816780,819120,"Watch that banned episode, we're bad boys."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,819120,820620,- You know I'm gonna be there.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,821520,824073,- [Stevie] These are chocolate lava cakes.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,825030,827760,- These are chocolate lava cakes.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,827760,830643,Now I will order one of these.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,832841,834663,- And you want an eruption?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,835920,836753,- Huh.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,837870,839220,- What are you laughing at?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,840081,841490,- You want an eruption?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,841491,842324,- You want an eruption?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,842324,844290,- You want an eruption?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,844290,846613,"Because if you do, I'll give you one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,846613,847893,- I can arrange for it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,849420,850470,- Do I have to pay for it?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,850470,853949,"- Mm, mm, that's good."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,853950,855030,- It's good but it also takes
sOjKF1Xvtnk,855030,856830,like it could have been made in an Easy Bake Oven.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,856830,858210,You know what I'm saying?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,858210,859380,"- And to this point,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,859380,861780,we've learned that any frozen dessert
sOjKF1Xvtnk,861780,863610,is just not making the cut.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,863610,865050,We've never chosen it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,865050,867330,"We're in like this, no pun intended,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,867330,868890,a sweet spot that's kind of in the middle.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,868890,871350,Sometimes you're going real fancy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,871350,874170,"- But that might be frozen, I don't know."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,874170,877139,- Frozen has generally sucked for desserts.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,877140,878610,"- [Rhett] Oh, look at that eruption."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,878610,880430,- Is it erupting?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,880430,884040,- Do you know back when I used to watch
sOjKF1Xvtnk,884040,885630,"cooking shows that had Gordon Ramsey,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,885630,888690,"you know, before I had my own Gordon Ramsey in house,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,888690,890013,"Josh Scherer is his name,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,892260,893940,he used to make such a big deal
sOjKF1Xvtnk,893940,895860,"when people would make this,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,895860,899370,"if they cut it open, it had to like dribble out."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,899370,902010,"And if it didn't, he just got so mad and cursed at 'em."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,902010,903240,- Oh really?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,903240,904830,"No, I hate that."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,904830,906480,It's powdery.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,906480,909240,"I think it's fancier, but there's like a dark chocolate."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,909240,910950,It's very cacao-ey.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,910950,911970,- That's why I like it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,911970,912803,It's better.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,912803,915000,It's more of a flourless approach.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,915000,915960,"- This one is like,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,915960,918180,this one is just really like
sOjKF1Xvtnk,918180,919980,you don't got to think about it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,919980,920940,- It's good.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,920940,922710,This is a step up for me.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,922710,924960,- [Link] This one has completely imploded.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,924960,926400,- Which I think it might be on purpose.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,926400,927840,- No judgment.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,927840,928763,"Oh, let's get into this."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,928763,930930,- Look at how much eruption has happened.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,930930,932550,"- It looks like the eruption here,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,932550,936003,the lava is some sort of pudding.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,937740,938700,Is that what all of 'em are?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,938700,939533,Ew.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,941165,941998,Ew.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,943351,944223,Is it fruity?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,945120,946529,"- No, it has a,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,946530,949890,"whatever makes German chocolate cake German chocolate cake,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,949890,952540,"I don't know what you put in there to make it German,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,954120,955529,it has that flavor.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,955530,956753,- [Nicole] Coconut and pecans?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,957810,958710,- Coconut and pecans. - It has something
sOjKF1Xvtnk,958710,960600,that lightens it up a little bit.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,960600,962519,I definitely don't dislike it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,962520,965149,I'm a little bit torn to be honest with you.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,965149,966000,- I hate it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,966000,968820,"I'm torn, but it's more of like I'm in pain."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,968820,970520,How long's it gonna take to heal?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,970520,972630,"- Oh, okay, that one I can't even get in there."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,972630,973630,- [Link] Oh.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,974880,976480,- It's like a Girl Scout cookie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,977880,979923,"- Yeah, it's real dark."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,980790,981870,- I'm having trouble.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,981870,982770,- It's crispy.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,982770,984320,Just pick it up with your hand.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,986460,988410,It kind of tastes like an Oreo.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,988410,989850,- It has a brownie consistency.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,989850,990683,- Yep.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,990683,991950,- Very much a brownie.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,991950,993450,"- You're right, it just tastes like a brownie."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,993450,994590,I know which one's my favorite.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,994590,996176,"I think you know, too."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,996176,998523,"- [Stevie] Three, two, one."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1002120,1003182,- We did it.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1003182,1004700,- Really?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1004700,1005960,- What do you mean really?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1005960,1007730,"- [Stevie] I mean, you went on and on"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1007730,1010670,"about how frozen isn't good enough, Link,"
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1010670,1014930,and look at where you landed right into frozen territory.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1014930,1015763,- What's the brand?
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1015763,1017000,- [Stevie] It is Trader Joe's.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1017000,1018980,so it's understandable.
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1018980,1021352,"- Trader Joe, you did it, girl, that is good."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1022190,1025610,"- [Stevie] So $1.75 each, they come in a two pack though."
sOjKF1Xvtnk,1025610,1026720,- Two pack?
