cRCPDTt_xUo,0,3094,"- Today, we're eating a $1,500 steak dinner."
cRCPDTt_xUo,3094,5927,(classical music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,9753,11634,- I'm gonna take a breather. (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,11634,14217,(upbeat music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,20190,22140,"It's me, the food daddy."
cRCPDTt_xUo,22140,24840,Thanks to Crocs for sponsoring today's video.
cRCPDTt_xUo,24840,27180,"Today, we are not just gonna be wearing Crocs,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,27180,29703,but we're going to be eating Crocs.
cRCPDTt_xUo,30668,31920,(eyelids blinking) What?
cRCPDTt_xUo,31920,32752,- What? - Huh?
cRCPDTt_xUo,32752,34590,"- Hey guys, it's YB."
cRCPDTt_xUo,34590,35583,- And Alex.
cRCPDTt_xUo,36498,39206,"- And Miles. Come on, we practiced this. (laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,39206,40560,"(television beep) Hey guys, it's YB."
cRCPDTt_xUo,40560,42000,- And Alex. - And Miles.
cRCPDTt_xUo,42000,42840,- And Jonathan.
cRCPDTt_xUo,42840,46715,- And welcome to another episode of the Food Babies.
cRCPDTt_xUo,46715,47670,(Miles laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,47670,49440,- I'm fucking so excited.
cRCPDTt_xUo,49440,50789,- Oh my god. - I've never been topped
cRCPDTt_xUo,50790,51990,in a Food Babies with you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,51990,52860,"- You mean, what do you mean?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,52860,53794,- [YB] Topped? - What?
cRCPDTt_xUo,53794,55949,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,55950,58050,"- I mean exactly what you think I mean,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,58050,59529,and I'm not going to elaborate.
cRCPDTt_xUo,59529,60734,- My brain couldn't- - Creepy uncle!
cRCPDTt_xUo,60734,62025,(spring bouncing)
cRCPDTt_xUo,62025,63960,- There's a new person at the table.
cRCPDTt_xUo,63960,64793,- That's right.
cRCPDTt_xUo,64793,67002,- My goal today is to eat more than Miles.
cRCPDTt_xUo,67002,68070,- Oh.
cRCPDTt_xUo,68070,69409,- [Jonathan] But first- - It's like watching us again.
cRCPDTt_xUo,69409,70242,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,70242,71850,"- You know, it's my first time starting."
cRCPDTt_xUo,71850,74159,I'm normally just kind of like the relief pitcher.
cRCPDTt_xUo,74160,74993,- [Miles] You're closer.
cRCPDTt_xUo,74993,76200,"- Yeah, I'm the closer. (group laughs) They bring me in,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,76200,78030,in the seventh or eighth inning.
cRCPDTt_xUo,78030,79170,"- And shout out to Will,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,79170,81960,who never finished anything in that video.
cRCPDTt_xUo,81960,83863,- That's why he is not here. - [Miles] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,83863,84696,Scram Will!
cRCPDTt_xUo,84696,85529,- He's out. (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,85529,86970,"He was a groomsmen in my wedding,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,86970,89188,but I don't want to see him on another day of my life.
cRCPDTt_xUo,89188,92105,(classical music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,94680,95790,"- My name is Atilla Bollok,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,95790,98010,I'm the chef at Barton G in Los Angeles.
cRCPDTt_xUo,98010,100230,Every meal at Barton G is its own experience.
cRCPDTt_xUo,100230,102330,It's theatrical. It's eventful.
cRCPDTt_xUo,102330,103950,It's often described as whimsical.
cRCPDTt_xUo,103950,106259,It's like a party at your own table every night.
cRCPDTt_xUo,106260,107940,Every time. Every dish.
cRCPDTt_xUo,107940,109080,Every cocktail.
cRCPDTt_xUo,109080,111630,"- This speed round, we are going to try popcorn shrimp,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,111630,114210,"lobster pop tarts, and kimchi steak tar tar."
cRCPDTt_xUo,114210,116100,Then we're gonna get into our steak round.
cRCPDTt_xUo,116100,117900,- And I don't wanna see any you're sort of putting
cRCPDTt_xUo,117900,118989,it under the table.
cRCPDTt_xUo,118989,120763,"- I've never done that before. - Oh, yeah."
cRCPDTt_xUo,120763,122760,- Food Babies conspiracy video.
cRCPDTt_xUo,122760,124200,"- Look, Keith is almost done."
cRCPDTt_xUo,124200,125783,"Look, Keith is almost done."
cRCPDTt_xUo,127290,128789,- [YB] Speed round everyone. Ready?
cRCPDTt_xUo,128789,130099,"3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,130100,130957,(ethereal music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,130957,132888,- [Group] Whoa.
cRCPDTt_xUo,132888,135994,"- [YB] Wow, look at that. (laughs) Wow."
cRCPDTt_xUo,135994,136827,(Miles cheers)
cRCPDTt_xUo,136827,137659,"- [Jonathan] So much more hardware than I,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,137660,139080,- [Miles] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,139080,140700,- [Jonathan] But it's so cool looking.
cRCPDTt_xUo,140700,141690,"At first I was like, oh,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,141690,143100,it's not the size of an actual pop tart.
cRCPDTt_xUo,143100,144573,But I think with the height- - [YB] Yes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,144573,145800,"- Like it actually, it's like,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,145800,146880,"if you took a pop cart and just,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,146880,148260,"pop tart, and just like (whistles)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,148260,149092,squeeze it together.
cRCPDTt_xUo,149093,150450,- I'm nervous. (YB and Jonathan laugh)
cRCPDTt_xUo,150450,152237,Now I miss Will. (laughs) - Why? Did it help?
cRCPDTt_xUo,152237,154518,- You want Will to be the bottom of the ladder?
cRCPDTt_xUo,154518,155430,As long as you can beat Will.
cRCPDTt_xUo,155430,156700,- Yeah. Right? (Miles forcefully exhales)
cRCPDTt_xUo,156701,159082,- So how do we start? (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,159082,162006,"- [Man] 3, 2, 1 go. (suspenseful music)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,162006,163724,- Lets go. - Okay.
cRCPDTt_xUo,163725,165150,- Mmm. Oh my god. - Mmm.
cRCPDTt_xUo,165150,166500,Oh that incredible.
cRCPDTt_xUo,166500,168060,- That's so rich. - Mm-hmm.
cRCPDTt_xUo,168060,169272,- I don't wanna go fast.
cRCPDTt_xUo,169272,171463,"- All I heard was mmm, mmm, mmm."
cRCPDTt_xUo,171463,174540,"- A lobster pop tart's a grownup like pastry strudel,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,174540,176879,"filled with Maine lobster that's been slow poached,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,176880,179610,and aromatic broth and a lobster infused bechamel.
cRCPDTt_xUo,179610,182700,"And then we pop that into like a retro toaster oven,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,182700,184020,that actually hits the table.
cRCPDTt_xUo,184020,187200,"- Mmm, oh my God, it's like a, it's dancing in my mouth."
cRCPDTt_xUo,187200,188032,- It's so cheesy.
cRCPDTt_xUo,188033,189570,- This is the inside of the pop tart.
cRCPDTt_xUo,189570,190930,Look how much cheese and lobsters is in there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,190930,192510,"- [YB] Oh, I just got the lobster bite."
cRCPDTt_xUo,192510,193500,- That feels like I'm- - Done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,193500,196653,- Camp side at a family reunion in Maine.
cRCPDTt_xUo,196653,197587,- [Man] Do you guys wanna acknowledge that Jonathan's done?
cRCPDTt_xUo,197587,199290,- Yeah. You guys are still- - Jonathan's done?
cRCPDTt_xUo,199290,200480,- I don't wanna acknowledge that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,200481,201360,"- Wait, what?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,201360,203040,"- You guys are still going? - All right, let's rock."
cRCPDTt_xUo,203040,204900,- I didn't come here to make friends.
cRCPDTt_xUo,204900,206299,I came here to make records.
cRCPDTt_xUo,207600,209190,Make records? Set records.
cRCPDTt_xUo,209190,210420,Set records. (timer dings)
cRCPDTt_xUo,210420,211476,"- Didn't come here to, (beep)."
cRCPDTt_xUo,211476,212607,- Move on. You can move on by the way.
cRCPDTt_xUo,212607,213989,"- Oh, oh, oh."
cRCPDTt_xUo,213990,215222,I thought we were. - [YB] No.
cRCPDTt_xUo,215222,216055,"- No, no. Go for it."
cRCPDTt_xUo,216055,218129,"- There was a white cheese before, now it's cheddar cheese."
cRCPDTt_xUo,218130,218970,I think it's two cheeses.
cRCPDTt_xUo,218970,220800,- It is perfect shrimp.
cRCPDTt_xUo,220800,224100,- We also have a popcorn shrimp dish that comes
cRCPDTt_xUo,224100,226710,"in a retro life size popcorn maker,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,226710,228090,with a couple of dipping sauces.
cRCPDTt_xUo,228090,229769,It's also very fun and interactive.
cRCPDTt_xUo,229770,231300,"- [Miles] It's, when you see a seafood restaurant"
cRCPDTt_xUo,231300,233070,"off the freaking side of the coast,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,233070,234240,"and you're like, oh, I gotta go there."
cRCPDTt_xUo,234240,235073,It's gonna have the perfect shrimp.
cRCPDTt_xUo,235073,236819,This is exactly that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,236820,237653,- Almost done with this.
cRCPDTt_xUo,237653,239310,- It doesn't taste anything like popcorn.
cRCPDTt_xUo,239310,240142,- It's really good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,240143,241480,"- Ooh, the sauce on the right,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,241480,243510,"it's, it's got a whole nother different ball (timer dings)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,243510,244342,"- [Alex] And the pop tart,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,244343,246240,it's so flakey - [YB] Mm-hmm.
cRCPDTt_xUo,246240,247650,and buttery. - Which ones are me?
cRCPDTt_xUo,247650,249258,- Those. - These?
cRCPDTt_xUo,249258,251580,- These two are mine (laughs) - Oh my god.
cRCPDTt_xUo,251580,252480,Foul play.
cRCPDTt_xUo,252480,253470,"- Look at it, it's right in the middle."
cRCPDTt_xUo,253470,255240,- What sort of shenanigans are going on over there?
cRCPDTt_xUo,255240,257790,"- There's shenanigans, every single freaking day man."
cRCPDTt_xUo,257790,259230,"- Don't you see, this is the middle between-"
cRCPDTt_xUo,259230,261540,"- You, I saw, I saw there was some,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,261540,263396,there was some renovation going on with the shrimp.
cRCPDTt_xUo,263396,264363,- How much shrimp did you have?
cRCPDTt_xUo,264363,265680,- Exactly half. - Done with shrimp?
cRCPDTt_xUo,265680,266940,- Done with shrimps?
cRCPDTt_xUo,266940,267773,- Oh my God.
cRCPDTt_xUo,267773,270103,- I'm moving on to the tar tar. (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,270103,271169,- I lost my lead.
cRCPDTt_xUo,271170,273660,"You ever like talk a big game,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,273660,275760,"and then you start doing the thing,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,275760,278340,and you become really insecure.
cRCPDTt_xUo,278340,280320,That's not what's happening right now. Definitely not.
cRCPDTt_xUo,280320,281280,All right. Moving on. (timer dings)
cRCPDTt_xUo,281280,282420,"Shrimp, done with shrimp."
cRCPDTt_xUo,282420,283590,Moving on to steak town. (energetic music begins)
cRCPDTt_xUo,283590,284970,- [Miles] I think the shrimp is maybe the best shrimp
cRCPDTt_xUo,284970,286110,I've ever had my entire life.
cRCPDTt_xUo,286110,288270,And I'm happy to move on to the beef.
cRCPDTt_xUo,288270,290580,- [Atilla] You'll be eating one of our steak tar tar dishes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,290580,292379,Also comes in a hut of sorts.
cRCPDTt_xUo,292380,293490,- Very good. - [Miles] The kimchi
cRCPDTt_xUo,293490,295560,blends with the tar tar so perfectly.
cRCPDTt_xUo,295560,297480,I would've never expected that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,297480,299700,- It's really good on the toast. It tastes way different.
cRCPDTt_xUo,299700,301980,- How did everyone get to the tartar already? (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,301980,302813,- I'm getting full already.
cRCPDTt_xUo,302813,306240,"- You know when a whale swallows like a big group of krill,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,306240,307110,that's how I feel.
cRCPDTt_xUo,307110,308099,- We've all been there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,308100,310350,"- Hey guys, before we move on to the rest of the video,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,310350,312090,we have a little surprise for you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,312090,314100,"- In 3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,314100,317220,"- It's me, one of the food daddies."
cRCPDTt_xUo,317220,319800,And today's video is sponsored by Crocs.
cRCPDTt_xUo,319800,321750,"Ooh, yes. We love them."
cRCPDTt_xUo,321750,324000,They're super comfortable. They're fun.
cRCPDTt_xUo,324000,325200,They're fashionable.
cRCPDTt_xUo,325200,327150,"And they have all these little things called Jibbitz,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,327150,330120,that let you be creative and express your own personality.
cRCPDTt_xUo,330120,331919,"- So I have a back black and white slide,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,331920,332910,and they're super cute.
cRCPDTt_xUo,332910,335670,"So I love wearing these, especially during food baby shoots,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,335670,337260,because we want to be comfortable.
cRCPDTt_xUo,337260,338280,I love the cushion.
cRCPDTt_xUo,338280,340710,"I love how easy they are to match with everything,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,340710,341759,and slide on and off.
cRCPDTt_xUo,341760,342593,"- [YB] So here,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,342593,344159,I got some fun Jibbitz also.
cRCPDTt_xUo,344160,346620,"I have the avocado, which is very cute."
cRCPDTt_xUo,346620,347850,It matches the colors.
cRCPDTt_xUo,347850,349350,They're super easy to customize.
cRCPDTt_xUo,349350,350820,"You can put whatever you want there,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,350820,352410,that really shows who you are.
cRCPDTt_xUo,352410,354840,So you can make it to the theme that you like.
cRCPDTt_xUo,354840,356100,To fit the color that you like.
cRCPDTt_xUo,356100,357540,- And these are my shoes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,357540,361260,These are actually some shoes that I wear all the time.
cRCPDTt_xUo,361260,362940,Says weekend vibe. - [YB] Nice.
cRCPDTt_xUo,362940,365940,"- [Ned] Super comfortable, and also very easy to clean."
cRCPDTt_xUo,365940,368790,"Like if I'm out in the backyard, playing with the kids,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,368790,370860,"get a little dirty, you just hose 'em down."
cRCPDTt_xUo,370860,373800,"But today, since it's a food video,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,373800,376110,we're not just gonna wear shoes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,376110,378300,We are going to eat the shoes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,378300,380819,"- What? - Okay, close your eyes,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,380820,382590,and take them away in
cRCPDTt_xUo,382590,384331,"3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,384331,385599,(ethereal music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,385599,387150,- Oh wow.
cRCPDTt_xUo,387150,387990,- That's a cake?
cRCPDTt_xUo,387990,389340,- It's a Croc cake. (upbeat music begins)
cRCPDTt_xUo,389340,392220,"Comfort is the key to happiness, but so is cake."
cRCPDTt_xUo,392220,394857,So today we are eating a Croc cake.
cRCPDTt_xUo,394857,395690,Ooh.
cRCPDTt_xUo,397450,399960,"Mmm, that is surprisingly good for a shoe."
cRCPDTt_xUo,399960,400793,- The traction on
cRCPDTt_xUo,400793,402150,the bottom's pretty nice. - [Ned] Mm-hmm.
cRCPDTt_xUo,402150,403180,Pretty authentic. - [Alex] Oh yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,403180,406080,- Is it a shoe or is it cake?
cRCPDTt_xUo,406080,407550,"Well, thank you Food Babies,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,407550,409889,for joining me in eating this Croc cake.
cRCPDTt_xUo,409890,414510,Check out the Crocs classic slides or the classic sandals.
cRCPDTt_xUo,414510,415650,Also you can get all
cRCPDTt_xUo,415650,418949,the Jibbitz your heart could desire online at crocs.com.
cRCPDTt_xUo,418950,421650,Enjoy that steak and say hi to Miles and Jonathan for me.
cRCPDTt_xUo,421650,422483,- [YB And Alex] We will.
cRCPDTt_xUo,422483,423420,Okay. See ya.
cRCPDTt_xUo,423420,424563,"- Yeah, 3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,425430,427320,"- Oh my gosh, and they're gone."
cRCPDTt_xUo,427320,429663,I guess I'm gonna finish this cake by myself.
cRCPDTt_xUo,430771,431604,- Uh oh.
cRCPDTt_xUo,431604,433260,"- Oh my God, that's gorgeous."
cRCPDTt_xUo,433260,434445,- [Atilla] This one is to the ladies.
cRCPDTt_xUo,434445,435278,- [YB] It's smoking.
cRCPDTt_xUo,435278,436770,"- [Alex] Thank you. - [Atilla] Smoking hot shrimp,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,436770,438238,smoking cold cocktail.
cRCPDTt_xUo,438239,439500,(group cheering)
cRCPDTt_xUo,439500,440790,"- [Atilla] All right, just wait for the smoke"
cRCPDTt_xUo,440790,442359,to subside before you get in there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,442359,446940,- [Group] Cheers.
cRCPDTt_xUo,446940,448470,- [Atilla] Our drinks are constantly evolving
cRCPDTt_xUo,448470,450230,and changing as that alcohol melts into it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,450230,452220,It also makes for a great show piece.
cRCPDTt_xUo,452220,454320,We also give them their own presentation.
cRCPDTt_xUo,454320,456810,"Some of the longstanding signature cocktails we have here,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,456810,457840,we've dubbed Buddhalicious.
cRCPDTt_xUo,457840,461669,It's a sweeter cocktail with watermelon and Litchi.
cRCPDTt_xUo,461670,464550,"One of our other signatures would be a Sabrinatini,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,464550,467520,modeled after our owner's favorite animal Sabrina.
cRCPDTt_xUo,467520,469229,"And that comes with a little chocolate monkey,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,469230,470220,hanging off the side of it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,470220,471840,- Barton owns a monkey?
cRCPDTt_xUo,471840,472800,- [Woman And Man] Several.
cRCPDTt_xUo,472800,474270,- Several monkeys? - [Man] Several monkeys.
cRCPDTt_xUo,474270,475860,- And Sabrina's his favorite? - [Man] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,475860,477990,"- Yeah, so, some of our signature cocktails,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,477990,480750,we're doing something called a subzero nitro bar.
cRCPDTt_xUo,480750,485400,"We use liquid nitrogen to freeze alcohol in a popsicle,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,485400,487650,changing the drink as it melts.
cRCPDTt_xUo,487650,489543,- The popsicle is pure alcohol?
cRCPDTt_xUo,489543,491633,- That's a pure alcohol- - Pure alcohol?
cRCPDTt_xUo,491633,492466,- Ooh.
cRCPDTt_xUo,492466,494550,"- Oh, that's delightful. Wow."
cRCPDTt_xUo,494550,495509,- That is fresh.
cRCPDTt_xUo,495510,497220,- That tastes really good. - Hints of alcohol.
cRCPDTt_xUo,497220,498457,- It tastes like a healthy juice.
cRCPDTt_xUo,498457,499290,- [YB] Yeah. - Like from a juice bar.
cRCPDTt_xUo,499290,500370,- It does. - [Miles] It really does.
cRCPDTt_xUo,500370,502169,Is it safe to- - Bite it? You won't.
cRCPDTt_xUo,502170,503160,- [Woman] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,503160,504230,You want me to take a bite? - Yeah. (dramatic music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,504230,507270,"- Is a bite, like a shot? How much- (group laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,507270,508103,- Cheers.
cRCPDTt_xUo,508992,510120,- To our vodka popsicles.
cRCPDTt_xUo,510120,510953,- Woo.
cRCPDTt_xUo,513458,514291,- Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,514291,515580,- Oh!
cRCPDTt_xUo,515580,516900,- That's vodka. Woo.
cRCPDTt_xUo,516900,519599,- I quite literally bit off more than I could chew.
cRCPDTt_xUo,519599,521785,- It's pretty good. - The cocktail's really good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,521786,523919,And it's good 'cause the popsicle is cold.
cRCPDTt_xUo,523919,524753,So a cold shot's better kinda.
cRCPDTt_xUo,524753,526600,"- Yeah, It's nice. - [Jonathan] Oh yeah."
cRCPDTt_xUo,526600,527844,- It's a little bit sweet. (clock ticking)
cRCPDTt_xUo,527844,529140,"(playful music begins) I already know I'm gonna lose,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,529140,530580,"don't worry, you win."
cRCPDTt_xUo,530580,532200,- Final bite.
cRCPDTt_xUo,532200,534033,"- I'm done, time."
cRCPDTt_xUo,534930,536087,"- I'm done. - Oh, 10 seconds."
cRCPDTt_xUo,536087,537180,- Pretty good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,537180,538890,"Hey, (indistinct) keep up. - (beep) you."
cRCPDTt_xUo,538890,539760,- [Miles] I'm really proud of you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,539760,541860,I'm proud of the work Jonathan's done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,541860,542774,- Getting nervous.
cRCPDTt_xUo,542775,544740,- Oh man. That was delicious.
cRCPDTt_xUo,544740,547110,"The steak tar tar, so, so delicious."
cRCPDTt_xUo,547110,550380,So bright. I'm not getting full at all.
cRCPDTt_xUo,550380,551213,"- No, no."
cRCPDTt_xUo,551213,553140,"- I know Miles Isn't getting full either, right?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,553140,554280,"Right, Miles? - Never not once."
cRCPDTt_xUo,554280,556470,"And by the way, I wanna say, YB lapped me through"
cRCPDTt_xUo,556470,557550,the shrimp. - No.
cRCPDTt_xUo,557550,559560,"- because there was some sort of,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,559560,560400,what's the word? - Done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,560400,562650,"- There was some shrimp pile erosion,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,562650,564000,"where it kind of, you know,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,564000,565590,spilled over to my side. - [YB] Nah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,565590,567030,"- And I feel good about what I did,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,567030,569730,and I think I enabled not only myself to complete
cRCPDTt_xUo,569730,571529,"the challenge, but for YB as well."
cRCPDTt_xUo,571530,572580,- So there's collusion?
cRCPDTt_xUo,572580,573413,- There's collusion. - No.
cRCPDTt_xUo,573413,574980,"- That's what you're saying, okay. All right."
cRCPDTt_xUo,574980,576660,"- Okay, last bite, last bite. (energetic music)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,576660,578519,- [Miles] You can do it Alex. Woo.
cRCPDTt_xUo,578520,580410,- Done. (group claps)
cRCPDTt_xUo,580410,581243,- Woo.
cRCPDTt_xUo,582480,583529,"- If this was a normal meal,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,583530,586020,I would stop eating right now because I am full.
cRCPDTt_xUo,586020,586853,- [Miles] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,586853,587970,But I'm inside to eat the steak.
cRCPDTt_xUo,587970,589560,"- I'm here to, I'm here to win."
cRCPDTt_xUo,589560,590700,"- You're here to party? - I'm here to party,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,590700,592440,"I'm here to win, and I'm here to watch you win."
cRCPDTt_xUo,592440,595290,"- I would like to win. I'm not feeling great about this one,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,595290,597021,but one day I will win a challenge.
cRCPDTt_xUo,597021,597922,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,597922,598770,- One day.
cRCPDTt_xUo,598770,600761,"- No, I believe in you. I think this is the day."
cRCPDTt_xUo,600761,601649,- You think this is the day?
cRCPDTt_xUo,601650,603017,- I think this is the day.
cRCPDTt_xUo,603017,604750,"- Maybe. - We're sharing, so."
cRCPDTt_xUo,604750,606763,"- You have, if you don't believe you can do it,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,606763,607596,you're not gonna do it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,607596,609330,You have to believe to in yourself.
cRCPDTt_xUo,609330,611005,"- The secret, you have to manifest it."
cRCPDTt_xUo,611005,612330,- Are you guys ready for the endurance round?
cRCPDTt_xUo,612330,613300,"- Yeah, let's do it. - Let's endure."
cRCPDTt_xUo,613300,616998,"- Let's try some steaks in 3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,616999,618749,- Whoa. - Oh my God.
cRCPDTt_xUo,619670,621269,"- [Miles] Oh my God, that's huge."
cRCPDTt_xUo,621270,622103,- [YB] Wow.
cRCPDTt_xUo,622103,623190,- [Alex] This is the craziest setup
cRCPDTt_xUo,623190,625919,I've ever seen at a restaurant. These forks? (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,625919,627780,- I am stoked.
cRCPDTt_xUo,627780,629760,I feel like it's my birthday.
cRCPDTt_xUo,629760,632252,- You guys each have a 25 ounce rib eye.
cRCPDTt_xUo,632252,634433,YB and I have a 60 ounce Tomahawk.
cRCPDTt_xUo,634433,635760,- [YB] Oh my God. - [Alex] And then we have
cRCPDTt_xUo,635760,636960,two types of potatoes
cRCPDTt_xUo,636960,639540,and some broccolini and asparagus and sauces.
cRCPDTt_xUo,639540,641250,- Wow. - That's a lot of food.
cRCPDTt_xUo,641250,642540,"- We're using the forks, right?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,642540,643680,- [Alex] Yeah. - [YB] Definitely.
cRCPDTt_xUo,643680,644760,- [Miles] Gotta use the fork. Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,644760,648090,"To look at a big steak like that, is pretty intimidating."
cRCPDTt_xUo,648090,650460,"It's the size of a John Grisham novel, like-"
cRCPDTt_xUo,650460,651930,- [Miles] Yeah. And the thickness.
cRCPDTt_xUo,651930,652830,- Or Twilight.
cRCPDTt_xUo,652830,654540,- Or Twilight. Yes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,654540,656250,- [Alex] Your steaks look bigger now that they're cut up.
cRCPDTt_xUo,656250,657210,- Yeah. How does that work?
cRCPDTt_xUo,657210,659220,"- They do, what happened? (group laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,659220,661870,"For the first bite, We do something a little special."
cRCPDTt_xUo,663180,665460,"I was given a sword by my ancestors, (medieval music begins)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,665460,667170,and the chefs of this restaurant.
cRCPDTt_xUo,667170,669209,"And I thought for the first bite,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,669210,672300,"Jonathan, in honor of the food babies,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,672300,676360,I would be honored if you would take this bite of meat
cRCPDTt_xUo,677370,680102,off of my sword. (YB claps)
cRCPDTt_xUo,680102,681652,- And how was it?
cRCPDTt_xUo,681652,682485,- Really good. - Yeah?
cRCPDTt_xUo,682485,683970,"- Yeah, you gotta check one off my plate."
cRCPDTt_xUo,683970,685110,- Do you wanna use the fork?
cRCPDTt_xUo,685110,687450,- I don't think you can snag meat with those forks.
cRCPDTt_xUo,687450,688740,I mean maybe you can. - [Alex] You could scoop.
cRCPDTt_xUo,688740,690420,- [Jonathan] Au contraire.
cRCPDTt_xUo,690420,691253,- That's a big one.
cRCPDTt_xUo,691253,692086,- Oh wow.
cRCPDTt_xUo,692086,693630,"Here we go. Miles, you ready?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,693630,695034,- [Miles] I accept this honor humbly.
cRCPDTt_xUo,695034,698279,(Alex and YB laugh)
cRCPDTt_xUo,698280,699810,- Took it so tenderly.
cRCPDTt_xUo,699810,701100,- Now the scales are even.
cRCPDTt_xUo,701100,702768,"- Wow, that's so good."
cRCPDTt_xUo,702768,704196,"- [Jonathan] It's really, really good."
cRCPDTt_xUo,704196,705386,- Ready? - Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,705387,706220,- It's really good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,706220,707926,"- Look how pink it is on the inside,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,707927,709350,I love that. - It's perfectly cooked.
cRCPDTt_xUo,709350,711449,"- And then the entrees that you'll be enjoying today,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,711450,712890,are some of our featured steaks.
cRCPDTt_xUo,712890,714780,"We have a dish called The Great American Steak,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,714780,717030,"that's featured with a four foot fork rib eye,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,717030,719310,"along with some house made beef bordelaise sauce,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,719310,721020,as well as an oversized Tomahawk.
cRCPDTt_xUo,721020,723450,"Probably around 50 or 60 ounces, I'd say."
cRCPDTt_xUo,723450,726030,And then we'll enjoy some sides and some sweets as well.
cRCPDTt_xUo,726030,728820,"- [Miles] Mmm, that's like a sponge of flavor."
cRCPDTt_xUo,728820,730830,- It's so buttery. It's so smooth.
cRCPDTt_xUo,730830,731880,- It's really tender.
cRCPDTt_xUo,731880,732780,- [YB] It's so soft.
cRCPDTt_xUo,732780,734255,I think this is the best steak I've ever had.
cRCPDTt_xUo,734255,735573,- Mm-hmm
cRCPDTt_xUo,735573,736406,- Oh. (amorous music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,736406,737490,- Did you just moan? (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,737490,738899,- I moaned. Sorry.
cRCPDTt_xUo,738900,740490,Excuse my moan.
cRCPDTt_xUo,740490,742716,"Pardon my moan, but I'm enjoying the steak."
cRCPDTt_xUo,742716,743850,(spring bouncing)
cRCPDTt_xUo,743850,747360,The flavor is just exploding outta my freaking mind hole.
cRCPDTt_xUo,747360,748620,- Mind hole?
cRCPDTt_xUo,748620,750600,"- I, I haven't even tried the sauce,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,750600,752550,"cause I, I dare not allow"
cRCPDTt_xUo,752550,753764,"my taste buds- - Oh, there's sauce?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,753764,754597,- Sauce. - It's so perfect.
cRCPDTt_xUo,754597,756180,This looks like a slice of tuna.
cRCPDTt_xUo,756180,758100,Like it's so perfectly red. - [Miles] It's perfect.
cRCPDTt_xUo,758100,760319,"Oh, have you, (group laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,760320,762000,"if you wanna dunk it in the sauce,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,762000,763563,"that's like, - [YB] This sauce?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,763563,764970,- [Miles] It's like a water balloon.
cRCPDTt_xUo,764970,765803,- Thank you. - [Miles] Get into one of
cRCPDTt_xUo,765803,766766,the fattier pieces. - Oh my god.
cRCPDTt_xUo,766767,769914,- And it exploded with such a glory.
cRCPDTt_xUo,769914,771270,(spring bouncing)
cRCPDTt_xUo,771270,773003,I don't think I'm gonna have the problem finishing this.
cRCPDTt_xUo,773003,774510,- I think this might be the first one
cRCPDTt_xUo,774510,775591,where we finish everything.
cRCPDTt_xUo,775591,777300,- Lets not not speak too soon. (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,777300,778133,- [Atilla] Are you gonna be able
cRCPDTt_xUo,778133,780690,to scrape that bone clean every bit?
cRCPDTt_xUo,780690,783360,I'm not quite sure if that's gonna happen.
cRCPDTt_xUo,783360,784560,"On the higher end of the steaks,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,784560,785790,"when we do like a feature,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,785790,788670,"that would be like a larger cut to serve two or three,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,788670,790800,we love to showcase a wagyu breed of cattle.
cRCPDTt_xUo,790800,793140,"We'll source that usually from local distributors,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,793140,795540,"that are bringing product in from Queensland, Australia."
cRCPDTt_xUo,795540,797880,"Prized around the world for their juiciness,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,797880,799140,their tenderness and the flavor.
cRCPDTt_xUo,799140,800580,It's kind of the standard when we're trying
cRCPDTt_xUo,800580,802140,to put something special on the plate.
cRCPDTt_xUo,802140,805020,"- So Miles, the last time you were with the food babies,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,805020,806640,you were about to get married.
cRCPDTt_xUo,806640,807960,So how is married life treating you?
cRCPDTt_xUo,807960,809160,"- Wow. - Yeah, oh my God."
cRCPDTt_xUo,809160,810449,- That is true.
cRCPDTt_xUo,810450,811950,Married life is fantastic.
cRCPDTt_xUo,811950,813240,"We had our wedding in our backyard,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,813240,815430,"so there's an immense amount of work and wildness,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,815430,817320,but our wedding was baller as hell.
cRCPDTt_xUo,817320,818610,I do say my wife.
cRCPDTt_xUo,818610,819990,- Just like that? Every time?
cRCPDTt_xUo,819990,821339,"- Yeah, I'll like, Hey, sorry."
cRCPDTt_xUo,821340,823770,"I'm meeting my, my wife here for a dinner reservation."
cRCPDTt_xUo,823770,825540,- What do you guys call each other?
cRCPDTt_xUo,825540,828990,"- Ooh, that's a good question. (group laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,828990,830910,- I don't say babe. - [Alex] Okay.
cRCPDTt_xUo,830910,833100,"- Because I don't believe in it, but I do say-"
cRCPDTt_xUo,833100,835977,"- I, unlike miles, I guess I do say babe."
cRCPDTt_xUo,835977,837717,"- You say babe? - Oh, you're a babe guy?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,837717,840082,"- Hey babe? Jonathan, that doesn't surprise me one second."
cRCPDTt_xUo,840082,840915,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,840915,843000,Jonathan was plucked right from the fifties
cRCPDTt_xUo,843000,845010,and brought into modern day.
cRCPDTt_xUo,845010,846540,"I'll say this in a number of platforms,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,846540,850199,but Jonathan once said he didn't have a TV in his apartment.
cRCPDTt_xUo,850200,851400,And that didn't surprise me at all.
cRCPDTt_xUo,851400,853860,I imagine Jonathan as someone that's standing
cRCPDTt_xUo,853860,856140,"in a wooden room, reading a deep novel."
cRCPDTt_xUo,856140,856973,I watch shows.
cRCPDTt_xUo,856973,858720,"They're just the dalliances of nature,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,858720,860016,happening outside of my world.
cRCPDTt_xUo,860016,862950,- I watch a hummingbird flit about-
cRCPDTt_xUo,862950,864780,- [Miles] Exactly. - in front of my window.
cRCPDTt_xUo,864780,866640,"- Wow, for a second, I forgot we were shooting a video,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,866640,867930,"and I just was like, this is a lovely dinner"
cRCPDTt_xUo,867930,869279,with friends. (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,869280,870630,"- No, back to the content."
cRCPDTt_xUo,870630,872340,It is incredibly delicious.
cRCPDTt_xUo,872340,874260,- I am getting for sure full by the way.
cRCPDTt_xUo,874260,875093,- Oh yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,875093,877410,Yeah. I haven't touched any of the green stuff.
cRCPDTt_xUo,877410,878850,"- [YB] Oh, same. - It's really good."
cRCPDTt_xUo,878850,880170,"I just tried the asparagus so far,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,880170,881339,but it's like crunchy still.
cRCPDTt_xUo,881340,884100,"- Once again, just in case anyone at the table"
cRCPDTt_xUo,884100,885509,"might not be clear on things,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,885510,886530,"do we have to finish the,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,886530,888150,the potatoes and the green stuff?
cRCPDTt_xUo,888150,889200,That's not part of the challenge?
cRCPDTt_xUo,889200,890190,YB says no.
cRCPDTt_xUo,890190,891647,Alexandria says maybe.
cRCPDTt_xUo,891647,893727,- YB just doesn't like vegetables. (laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,893727,894957,"- I'm getting better,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,894957,897602,but I'm just not a big vegetable person.
cRCPDTt_xUo,898719,901830,You know? Sometimes people don't like bananas.
cRCPDTt_xUo,901830,903030,Some people don't like-
cRCPDTt_xUo,903030,904860,- Television. - Exactly.
cRCPDTt_xUo,904860,908040,Some people don't like meat. I don't like vegetables.
cRCPDTt_xUo,908040,909360,- I'm actually getting really full already.
cRCPDTt_xUo,909360,910225,"- Yeah. I have to,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,910225,911998,I feel like I have to take an oil break.
cRCPDTt_xUo,911998,912930,- Oil break?
cRCPDTt_xUo,912930,915149,"- Yeah, we're getting the Keith voice over here."
cRCPDTt_xUo,915150,917160,- I'm gonna take a quick nap. - [Jonathan] Yep.
cRCPDTt_xUo,917160,919110,"- All right, he's back."
cRCPDTt_xUo,919110,921209,- I don't wanna waste any of this really good food.
cRCPDTt_xUo,921210,923725,Let's bring in a guest. Everybody welcome Jake.
cRCPDTt_xUo,923725,924558,(Group cheering)
cRCPDTt_xUo,924558,926657,"- Ladies and gentleman, (indistinct) Jake!"
cRCPDTt_xUo,928560,931529,Now you're relatively new to the company. (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,931530,933660,and we've got a special tradition
cRCPDTt_xUo,933660,937170,that we do every couple minutes.
cRCPDTt_xUo,937170,939329,"Interesting that you choose from your plate this time,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,939330,940163,Not my plate.
cRCPDTt_xUo,940163,941643,"- Oh, I'll go from your plate."
cRCPDTt_xUo,942720,944519,Let's see if I have the dexterity.
cRCPDTt_xUo,944520,946260,"- [Jake] Oh, oh."

cRCPDTt_xUo,955893,957715,"- Oh, it's so juicy and wet."
cRCPDTt_xUo,957715,958548,- [YB] Right?
cRCPDTt_xUo,958548,959381,- Jake!
cRCPDTt_xUo,960327,962280,"- Now Jake, you're sort of the gen Z correspondant."
cRCPDTt_xUo,962280,964770,So what's the goss? What's the tea?
cRCPDTt_xUo,964770,965963,"- I don't really know what's going on, I mean-"
cRCPDTt_xUo,965963,968760,- This is your whole job. (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,968760,970740,- Let's see. Addison Rae is dating someone new.

cRCPDTt_xUo,973710,975690,- Wait. Addison Rae is dating Mod Sun.
cRCPDTt_xUo,975690,977224,"- No, he has like super long hair, is that Mod Sun?"

cRCPDTt_xUo,978444,979620,- Avril Lavign's dating Mod son.
cRCPDTt_xUo,979620,980550,- Yes. - By the time
cRCPDTt_xUo,980550,983269,this comes out (beep) gonna be long dead.
cRCPDTt_xUo,983270,986580,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,986580,989610,"- If something happens, Miles is suspect number one."
cRCPDTt_xUo,989610,991377,- I'm not gonna assassinate (beep).
cRCPDTt_xUo,992430,993339,- [Jake] Oh my God.
cRCPDTt_xUo,993340,995280,- Okay. I shouldn't have to deny that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,995280,997047,- I wanna try some hespargus.
cRCPDTt_xUo,998711,1000261,- I'm sorry. - What?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1000261,1001686,"- Is that, is that hespargus?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1001686,1002597,Hespargus?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1002597,1003579,- Asparagus?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1003579,1004412,Hespargus.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1004412,1005453,- [Alex] What are you saying?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1005453,1006408,- Is that not hespargus?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1006408,1007241,- Asparagus.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1007241,1009090,- Asparagus. A?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1009090,1010040,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1010040,1011089,- Is that really how it's spelled?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1011090,1012153,With an a? - [YB] Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1012153,1013640,- Spell hespargus. - Hespargus?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1013640,1018640,H-E-S-P-A-R-G-U-S. Hespargus.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1020120,1023089,- Welcome back to the Barton G spelling bee. (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1023090,1024170,- Can I try one?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1024170,1027140,"- Oh yeah. Sorry, that really caught me off guard."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1027140,1028579,- This break is not good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1028579,1029569,I should have kept eating.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1029569,1031939,"- Oh my God. Yeah, I'm hitting ball."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1031939,1034009,"- Yeah, we're at the point where we really can't stop."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1034010,1034850,"- [Jake] No Return. - Perfectly cooked steak,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1034850,1037910,and then a nice chunk of fat right there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1037910,1040004,"- Ooh. - Jonathan, you're struggling."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1040004,1042263,"- No YB, you're not wrong. I am struggling."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1043310,1045230,"I kind of, you know,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1045230,1047660,"I kind of regret being so brava,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1047660,1049820,"you know, braggadocious at the beginning."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1049820,1051620,- So does anyone wanna bite the Tomahawk bone?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1051620,1052640,There's some good meat on there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1052640,1053957,- Jake? - I do like meat.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1053957,1056919,(group laughing)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1056919,1058027,- Ow. (group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1058027,1059423,- It bites back.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1059423,1060530,"- [Jonathan] I've never done it before,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1060530,1061363,so I have no idea. - [Alex] If you bite the meat
cRCPDTt_xUo,1061363,1062213,off the bone.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1063275,1064340,(Jake grunts)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1064340,1065994,"- Oh my God. Oh, she's tender. (Miles laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1065994,1067760,That is really good. - [YB] Is it?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1067760,1069050,"- Jonathan, are you almost done?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1069050,1071960,These are the last four bites Mr. Bon Senior.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1071960,1074985,"- Wow, the sensei has become the student."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1074985,1076549,- [YB] How did it change so fast?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1076550,1081170,"- [Miles] I just hit a big wall with the meat situation,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1081170,1083300,but I will not be shown up.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1083300,1084500,- This one's all fat.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1084500,1085790,- Still doing final bites or?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1085790,1088460,"- Oh yeah. Oh no, we have the dessert for that."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1088460,1090284,- Oh my god. Do we have dessert?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1090285,1092100,- (beep)-ing Jesus.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1092100,1094910,- I was gonna end this and sprint to my car.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1094910,1095981,- [Jonathan] Cotton candy. - Try to get home
cRCPDTt_xUo,1095981,1098360,"before I shit my pants. - Candy's gonna be, (laughs)."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1098360,1100610,- Everyone needs a little encouragement right now.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1100610,1101471,- Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1101471,1103519,"- Look at this, the plates are almost empty."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1103520,1104690,"- If I blended all this up,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1104690,1105740,it'd just be like a little bit.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1105740,1107000,- Don't.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1107000,1107833,- I can't do it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1107833,1108710,- You can. - [Jake] We believe in you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1108710,1110110,- I can't do it. Here's one.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1111770,1114740,"- Alex, you have to. We're so close."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1114740,1115880,- I'm trying.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1115880,1118220,It's like my mouth is getting tired of chewing.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1118220,1120409,"- I feel drunk, but I haven't drank my thing."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1120410,1122090,- I think my heart stopped.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1122090,1125256,"- Me either. Jank, (laughs) Jank drank all mine. (laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1125256,1126440,"- Oh my god, I'm sorry, Alex."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1126440,1127273,"I just like, honestly, I feel better."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1127273,1129649,"It's like helping my hangover right now, honestly."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1129650,1131420,- Ugh. (Alex laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1131420,1133880,My eyes are getting droopy.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1133880,1135358,- Yeah. I'm getting sleepy.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1135358,1136191,- Yep. - Mm-hmm.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1136191,1137632,- Right? Like I feel heavy.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1137632,1139713,- Yeah. - Oh! You just poked me.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1139713,1141080,"- Oh, your pants."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1141080,1142309,"- I dropped my fork, I'm sorry YB."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1142310,1144410,- That's okay. - I'm throwing things.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1144410,1145550,I'm all over the place.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1145550,1147980,Okay. So these are two big pieces of fat here.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1147980,1150410,"Now, do I have to eat these to be eligible"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1150410,1151580,for the big grand size?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1151580,1153110,"- Studio audience? What do you guys, what do,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1153110,1154103,what do you think? - Do we have to eat the fat?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1154103,1155030,- Does Miles have to eat the fat?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1155030,1156030,- [Man] Eat the fat.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1157117,1158000,- Eat the fat.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1158000,1158982,- People have spoken Miles.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1158982,1160832,- Eat the fat. - I projectile vomit.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1161930,1164489,"If I melted it down and drank it, I just think,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1164489,1165322,I gotta take a nap. - We could do that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1165322,1166970,- [Jonathan] Miles I believe in you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1166970,1168350,I believe in you. - I really didn't think
cRCPDTt_xUo,1168350,1169970,I was gonna be this exhausted.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1169970,1171742,- I'm on my last bite. Here we go.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1172790,1173630,- I got like
cRCPDTt_xUo,1173630,1175220,three big bites here. - I'm done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1175220,1176053,- You're on your last bite?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1176053,1177440,"- Well, I already finished my half."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1177440,1178789,"- Oh, is everyone else finished?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1178790,1180170,- No. - I'm done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1180170,1181038,"- I think I'm done. - [Man] Alex, YB,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1181038,1183633,and Miles have to power through.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1183634,1185999,"- Yeah, you got it boss. Woo."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1185999,1187262,"- Okay, last bite."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1187262,1189763,"- [Jonathan] You got it YB! - Yeah, Miles."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1189763,1191141,- [Alex] Are you shaking it down?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1191141,1193070,- Yeah. - [Jonathan] Yeah!
cRCPDTt_xUo,1193070,1195080,Go team. Don't think about it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1195080,1196190,- It's done.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1196190,1197409,I gotta take a breather.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1197410,1199583,"- Final bite, final bite. - This one."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1200570,1201620,- Oh. Are we supposed to dedicate?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1201620,1203382,"- No, that's for the dessert. - [Jonathan] Oh, yeah."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1203383,1204395,(energetic music)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1204395,1206990,(group clapping)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1206990,1208193,"- Okay, final bite."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1209727,1211310,- Yay.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1211310,1212630,"Guys, we finished it."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1212630,1213650,- It's still so good.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1213650,1214950,- We did it. - We did it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1216094,1218478,- The weakest high five.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1218478,1219311,- I'm proud of us.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1219311,1220820,"- Jonathan, you most of all."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1220820,1221659,"- Oh, thanks man."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1221660,1222990,- Why not me?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1222990,1224032,- Yeah. Why not her? - Well.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1224032,1225890,"Because you know what, it's like. It's like,"

cRCPDTt_xUo,1227756,1228830,You know what I mean? - I'm LeBron?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1228830,1229663,"- Yeah, of course you are."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1229663,1231169,"- Cheers, you guys."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1231170,1232400,- Cheers. - Bye.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1232400,1234275,"- And now, onto the dessert round."

cRCPDTt_xUo,1244970,1247280,"We have two enormous desserts here,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1247280,1249157,which I'm very excited to try.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1249157,1250491,"- [Atilla] All right, let's do it."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1250491,1253241,(group cheering)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1255306,1256640,- Yeah.

cRCPDTt_xUo,1259610,1262573,Marie Antoinette was who? Just in case Jonathan didn't know.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1262573,1264050,- She was the chemist.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1264050,1264980,- [Miles] That's right.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1264980,1269030,"- [Jonathan] No, she was the wife of King Louie the 16th?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1269030,1269863,- [Miles] Right. - [Jonathan] The last-
cRCPDTt_xUo,1269863,1270787,"- YB, that's right."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1272210,1274090,- I'm just gonna Google Marie Antoinette real quick.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1274090,1274923,(group laughing)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1274923,1276723,- It's not bloody Mary right? - That's someone else?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1276723,1278120,"- No, that's, you say that, (laughs)"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1278120,1279220,You don't say Marie Antoinette's name
cRCPDTt_xUo,1279220,1281150,in the mirror three times.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1281150,1282412,She's not gonna appear. - Try.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1282412,1285440,- Try. - Has anyone tried?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1285440,1286273,Where's the mirror?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1286273,1288620,"- And to help us eat these desserts is our friend,"

cRCPDTt_xUo,1297410,1300110,"there was an event where the models were walking around,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1300110,1303470,"showcasing the jewelry and Barton had the idea of,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1303470,1306169,"said, Hey, let's get those girls to put on some wigs"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1306170,1308600,and have the guests eat the cotton candy
cRCPDTt_xUo,1308600,1309770,off the top of their heads.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1309770,1312920,"thought up of a wild and whimsical hairdo for,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1312920,1314210,for Marie as we called her.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1314210,1316100,Let Them Eat Cake is the name of the dish.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1316100,1318140,It's just surely like a signature dish.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1318140,1319970,I don't think it's going anywhere. Anytime soon.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1319970,1321620,- I feel like you're handing me a little pet.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1321620,1323172,- Yeah. - Aw

cRCPDTt_xUo,1328040,1329600,"- Oh, wow."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1329600,1331669,- YB balled it up previously.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1331670,1332503,Is that what you're supposed to do?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1332503,1333336,"- [Caitlin] Oh, is that a thing?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1333336,1334280,"- Oh, I don't know. I usually do that"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1334280,1335480,so it's easier to eat.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1335480,1338600,"- After all that meat, just like a little ooh,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1338600,1339770,really brings me there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1339770,1341510,"- [Alex] Put it in your water, it'll just disappear."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1341510,1343310,- Oh yeah. I watch oddly satisfying videos
cRCPDTt_xUo,1343310,1344143,of that all the time.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1344143,1344976,- When they like put it in the lake?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1344976,1345809,- Yeah.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1345809,1347427,"- [Caitlin] 3, 2, 1."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1349805,1352094,(group laughs)
cRCPDTt_xUo,1352094,1354498,- Jonathan. - So anticlimactic.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1354498,1356849,- [Jonathan] 3. 2. 1.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1356849,1357682,- Whoa.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1358718,1360484,- That was instant.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1360484,1362223,That was so quick. - [YB] I didn't expect that.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1362223,1363972,- That was exciting. - Now you have to drink it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1363972,1366290,- There's still like crystals down there.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1366290,1368023,- [Alex] It's sugar. - [Miles] Jonathan?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1370670,1372500,- Honestly it tastes- - [Caitlin] Sugar water?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1372500,1373971,"- like, like sugar water. Yeah."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1373971,1375721,There's not much of a taste at all.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1375721,1376669,- You could make that a cocktail.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1376670,1378140,- The ice cream.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1378140,1379070,- What is that?
cRCPDTt_xUo,1379070,1379970,"- [Atilla] It's a celebration, right?"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1379970,1380970,- [Group] Oh my God.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1381950,1383899,"- Yeah. So, the other dessert you're gonna try today"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1383900,1385790,"is called Dolla Dolla Bills Y'all,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1385790,1387170,and this is probably one of
cRCPDTt_xUo,1387170,1388790,the most fun desserts that we have
cRCPDTt_xUo,1388790,1390230,"in that with every single one,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1390230,1392630,"we're gonna torch a seemingly gold bar,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1392630,1394100,that's actually made of chocolate.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1394100,1397400,Help that collapse onto a tart that's sitting underneath it.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1397400,1400010,"It's made of a Graham cracker crust,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1400010,1403310,"a chocolate dulce de leche tart, and toasted meringue,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1403310,1406850,"essentially like our version of a, of a campfire s'mores."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1406850,1408860,And the presentation is just completely over top.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1408860,1410929,And of course who doesn't love those flavors.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1410930,1413030,- Oh wow. That's rich.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1413030,1415970,- It's like literally marshmallow melted.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1415970,1416809,- Thank you.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1416810,1419330,"- There was a long time in my life where I like,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1419330,1421820,"could not eat s'mores because as a kid,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1421820,1424700,"I like went to a cookout just by happenstance,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1424700,1426710,happened to catch the flu that night.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1426710,1428149,"And so in my mind,"
cRCPDTt_xUo,1428150,1432320,"s'mores and the flu were like intimately combined, yeah."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1432320,1435320,"And it took, took years, but I'm finally back."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1435320,1437563,"Like I can have a s'more now, but here we go."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1438920,1440833,"Oh, that's really good."
cRCPDTt_xUo,1440833,1441800,I like the s'more thing.
cRCPDTt_xUo,1441800,1443297,- I want some of the s'mores too.
