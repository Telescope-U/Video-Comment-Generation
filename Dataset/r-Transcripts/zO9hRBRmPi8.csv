zO9hRBRmPi8,80,2879,cd projekt red are experts in open world
zO9hRBRmPi8,2879,5200,game design with the witcher 3 and
zO9hRBRmPi8,5200,7839,cyberpunk 2077 combining freedom of
zO9hRBRmPi8,7839,10719,exploration with compelling storytelling
zO9hRBRmPi8,10719,12480,in unparalleled fashion
zO9hRBRmPi8,12480,14719,through a new partnership with epic cd
zO9hRBRmPi8,14719,16640,projekt bread is building a brand new
zO9hRBRmPi8,16640,20560,witcher saga with ue5
zO9hRBRmPi8,20960,22800,our cooperation with epic has just
zO9hRBRmPi8,22800,26320,started it was the shift towards uh open
zO9hRBRmPi8,26320,28480,world support that brought unrelenting
zO9hRBRmPi8,28480,30880,five to our attention
zO9hRBRmPi8,30880,33040,so there was one demo uh that happened
zO9hRBRmPi8,33040,34480,last year that was the medieval
zO9hRBRmPi8,34480,36160,environment demo where
zO9hRBRmPi8,36160,38399,at one point uh there's a notice board
zO9hRBRmPi8,38399,39920,that looks strangely familiar to things
zO9hRBRmPi8,39920,41440,we've done in the past that has even a
zO9hRBRmPi8,41440,43120,sign that says monster slayer wanted and
zO9hRBRmPi8,43120,45039,i'm like hmm are they are they trying to
zO9hRBRmPi8,45039,46399,tell us you know come come over to
zO9hRBRmPi8,46399,48079,unreal engine look how great your games
zO9hRBRmPi8,48079,49520,could look on there is that was that
zO9hRBRmPi8,49520,51680,whole demo made with that nefarious
zO9hRBRmPi8,51680,53199,purpose i don't know but it definitely
zO9hRBRmPi8,53199,54640,definitely caught my eye
zO9hRBRmPi8,54640,57039,this opens a new chapter for us where we
zO9hRBRmPi8,57039,60239,really want to see how our experience in
zO9hRBRmPi8,60239,63280,building open world games is combined
zO9hRBRmPi8,63280,67119,with the whole engineering power of epic
zO9hRBRmPi8,67119,68640,one of the things that is really
zO9hRBRmPi8,68640,70240,important to keep in mind when when
zO9hRBRmPi8,70240,72000,talking about open world games versus
zO9hRBRmPi8,72000,74080,let's say more linear games is
zO9hRBRmPi8,74080,75680,the possibilities of the things that can
zO9hRBRmPi8,75680,77759,go wrong or the the the scenarios that
zO9hRBRmPi8,77759,79360,you have to consider are
zO9hRBRmPi8,79360,81040,exponentially higher than linear games
zO9hRBRmPi8,81040,82320,players can go in whatever direction
zO9hRBRmPi8,82320,84080,that they want they can handle content
zO9hRBRmPi8,84080,86159,in in any order that they want
zO9hRBRmPi8,86159,88240,theoretically and to really encapsulate
zO9hRBRmPi8,88240,90560,that means that you need a really stable
zO9hRBRmPi8,90560,92479,environment where you can be able to
zO9hRBRmPi8,92479,94400,make changes with a high level of
zO9hRBRmPi8,94400,95600,confidence that it's not going to break
zO9hRBRmPi8,95600,98560,in 1600 other places down the line
zO9hRBRmPi8,98560,100720,unreal engine is like a toolbox which
zO9hRBRmPi8,100720,102960,has a lot of features a lot of solutions
zO9hRBRmPi8,102960,105439,already there that allow teams to just
zO9hRBRmPi8,105439,106720,try new stuff
zO9hRBRmPi8,106720,108399,the fact that unreal is used by a lot of
zO9hRBRmPi8,108399,110079,teams already in the world a lot of
zO9hRBRmPi8,110079,111759,perspectives are projected into the
zO9hRBRmPi8,111759,113680,design of the tools and that helps the
zO9hRBRmPi8,113680,117200,tool to be way more agile so all in all
zO9hRBRmPi8,117200,119520,it's a really really cool technology to
zO9hRBRmPi8,119520,121280,like prototype and make environments
zO9hRBRmPi8,121280,122560,really quickly
zO9hRBRmPi8,122560,126399,really beautiful and very realistic
zO9hRBRmPi8,126399,128560,epic and cd projekt red are the two
zO9hRBRmPi8,128560,130479,companies that really want to achieve
zO9hRBRmPi8,130479,132720,something great we won't stop just you
zO9hRBRmPi8,132720,134239,know by uh
zO9hRBRmPi8,134239,136560,developing some features we won't stop
zO9hRBRmPi8,136560,138640,there yeah we will continue to to work
zO9hRBRmPi8,138640,140080,together to achieve something
zO9hRBRmPi8,140080,143840,extraordinary in the end
