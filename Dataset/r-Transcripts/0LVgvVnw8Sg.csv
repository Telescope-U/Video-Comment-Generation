0LVgvVnw8Sg,400,3040,All right. Juts got to add a few more lines right here…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,3040,7120,And done! It looks amazing! Someone is definitely gonna fall for it.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,7120,10164,Such a nice day out! Glad I went for a wal—AH!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,10480,12240,How did that even happen?? It’s just a draw—AHHH!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,12240,16960,Whoaaaa. What the? My drawing brought us to this place!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,17520,18400,Hi! Hello!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,19680,20320,Welcome!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,22818,25760,Umm…wow. What is she even doing up there?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,25760,28960,Oh. Right. I have students now. First up!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,28960,31840,"I want to see you draw a unicorn! All right? So, get to work!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,31840,34720,Eww! This toothbrush was just in her mouth!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,34720,37600,Oh no oh no oh no… Is this what I think it is?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,38400,40080,YUCK!! Get this away from me!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,40800,42290,"Well, I don’t want it!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,42480,47920,Oh. Wait. It’s actually giving me an idea! Time to get to work on my unicorn drawing!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,47920,49920,Gotta start with some colorful paint of course.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,50720,52960,Rainbows are great for unicorns.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,52960,55440,Now I’m gonna use this toothbrush to make a mane pattern!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,56240,60320,Oookay. I definitely don’t need a toothbrush to plan my own picture.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,60320,61680,I’m using a marker.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,61680,64800,Okay. Got the ears. The horn. He needs some eyes of course.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,64800,69840,Oh! Let me see how yours is going! Oof. Yeesh. That’s …something all right.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,69840,72799,Noo! I’m so bad at drawing unicorns!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,72800,75440,"Yikes. Well, better get back to my picture."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,75440,76560,"Oh, I know!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,76560,80720,It’s magic wand time! Ta-dah! The rest of the unicorn has appeared!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,80720,83040,"Ooh, I really like how this turned out. Yay me!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,83600,86320,Awww. Yours turned out so pretty!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,86320,89680,"Well, hey. We still have time to fix yours. I have an idea."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,90560,92320,I’ll just press your paper against mine.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,93040,95440,"Look, see? You have a duplicate now, too!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,96080,98400,Hey! Miss! I think we’re done with our pictures.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,98400,102800,"Wow, girls! Those turned out great! I’m really impressed with both of you!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,103360,106480,Yes! We did it! And we both get prizes!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,106480,107120,Cheers!   
0LVgvVnw8Sg,110960,113840,Hey. Hey. Are you seeing what I’m seeing?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,114400,116240,Oh. My. Gosh.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,116240,119799,It’s got really long teeth. OH NO! It’s getting a lot bigger!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,120163,122640,"Hah! Don’t worry, you two. It can’t hurt you."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,123200,124719,"Well, that’s a relief."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,124720,127360,But that’s our cue for the next drawing challenge!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,127360,130320,"Huh. Okay. So, we have the number five on our papers."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,130320,132080,I think I know what I can do with this.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,132080,134880,I just gotta start by adding lines to what’s already there.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,134880,138400,"Little squiggles down the back. An eye, of course. And can’t forget the teeth."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,138400,141439,"Dinos need legs and arms, too. He needs to walk around."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,141440,144240,"Okay, time to add some color. I want him to look fearsome."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,144800,148160,Just a little bit more and done! Yes! He looks great!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,148160,150880,Keep your eyes on your own paper this time! Hey!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,151520,154320,Ugh. Come on! Can’t you let me have even a little peek?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,154320,156560,"Hey, wait a second. Pencils!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,156560,159200,These are definitely going to help me with my problem.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,159200,161200,"Okay, just need some tightening over here…"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,161200,163280,Maybe another adjustment to this pencil…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,163280,165760,I made the erasers on the pencils into shapes!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,165760,168560,A heart on this one and a star over on this one.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,168560,171120,"All right, let me flip this over so I can put these to work."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,171760,175280,Okay. Back to my good ol’ trusty marker. I need a sort of egg shape.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,175280,178240,And now for the erasers! I’ll just dip them into the paint!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,178240,179520,Time to start dabbing!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,179520,182400,"All right, stop! Let’s see your artwork, please!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,183040,185040,"Well, here’s mine, miss! I hope you like him!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,186320,189200,"And here’s mine! He hasn’t hatched yet, though."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,189200,191760,What? I don’t know if that counts…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,191760,194480,Oh! But yours is great! You’re the winner!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,194480,197440,Me? Really? Yes! Thank you so much!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,197440,201280,I love these chips. But they’re even better when shared with a friend.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,202240,204320,Besides. I thought your egg was really cute.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,205040,206308,Thank you!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,208211,210903,Uhhh…what the heck is going on with her now?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,211060,216400,I really don’t get her. What’s she doing with those towels? Hi. Yeah. We’re still here. Remember us?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,216400,219439,"Well, okay fine then. Here. Have this flamingo."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,219440,222080,"Oh, a flamingo! Okay! This should be fun!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,222080,224480,I’m gonna go with my favorite method and trace my hand.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,225520,227840,"Okay, good. Now to rotate my paper."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,227840,231680,This bird is gonna need a head for sure. And then of course his big beak.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,231680,234079,"Okay, eye is done. Now for the wings."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,234080,237440,And can’t forget his long legs. Now for the color!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,237440,239440,Can’t have a flamingo without some pink!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,239440,242640,He’s gonna be so pretty when I’m done! I just know it!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,242640,245200,Just keep coloring. Just keep coloring.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,245200,246959,Just a little bit more and… Done!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,247760,250480,Let me see. Gotta make sure to get the scale right…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,250480,254959,"Eh. I’ll just wing it. Heh. That was a pretty good pun, if I say so myself."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,254960,257440,Okay. He looks something like this. I think…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,257440,259120,"Okay sure. That’s a flamingo, I guess."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,260239,264080,Phew. That refreshing bath was just what I needed. What do you got?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,265760,268400,Ew. What is that? Some sort of weird chicken?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,269440,272080,"Awww. Yeah, sorry. I have to agree with her."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,272080,276159,"Yours looks very nice, though. You win the flamingo challenge. Congrats!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,276160,278240,Yes! I won one all on my own!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,278240,281440,"Listen, don’t feel so sad. I’ll share of course! Here!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,281440,286377,Thanks! This does help me feel better!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,288278,291125,A rose under any name still smells as sweet!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,291200,293800,All right! Yeah! It’s flower drawing time!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,294198,297280,Huh. Oh no… My paint is totally tacky!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,297840,300880,Shoot! What am I going to do now? I need art supplies!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,301520,304479,Let’s see… which color should I start with? Pink of course!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,305120,307280,No you can’t borrow this one. I need it.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,307280,310320,PLEEEEASE! My paint is all tacky and too dry!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,310320,313200,I said no! You’ll have to figure something out on your own.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,313200,316480,Now…how do I want to draw my rose? I want it to be beautiful…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,317040,319080,Okay yeah. I think that will work nicely.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,319547,322880,Ugh! I can’t believe she wouldn’t share with me! She’s so mean!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,322880,326000,I’m getting myself all worked up over this! I need to breathe!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,327600,330480,Whoa. I’m feeling a little lightheaded after that…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,331360,332960,Huh? What happened to my bag?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,333600,336886,"Great. There’s paint all over it! Get off, paint! I said get off!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,337336,339760,Ahem. What the…?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,340480,343280,"Keep your paint on your paper, please."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,343280,343920,Huh?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,343920,346720,Use the bag to apply the paint.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,347014,351440,OH! Oh. Okay. Got it. I guess I’ll just dab it like she said…
0LVgvVnw8Sg,351440,353520,There’s one. Maybe another one over here?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,353520,356800,No way! These are turning out great! Who knew?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,356800,359039,Let’s see…what else can I do? I know!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,359600,363040,"Where’s she off to? Eh, it doesn’t matter. She can do what she wants."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,363040,365840,Just gonna borrow this…yoink!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,366640,370160,"Yes! Okay, I’ve got the paintbrush. Time to finish up my art."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,370160,372560,Can’t have flowers without pretty leaves to go with them!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,372560,375200,"Time’s up! Let me see your rose artwork, please."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,376400,380000,Okay. I’m ready. Here’s my picture! Isn’t it beautiful?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,380000,385040,"I mean, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but no. It’s not. Hers is, though!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,385040,386240,That’s amazing!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,386240,389440,It is. And that’s why she’s the winner for this round.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,389440,392320,YES! I won another one! I can’t believe it!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,392320,395040,Ooh! Candy! My favorite! Look!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,395040,396640,Yes. Congratulations.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,398320,401440,"Oh Mr. Kitty. You’re my favorite, yes you are!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,401440,405200,"Oh. Right. The challenge. Umm, draw Mr. Kitty, I guess."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,405200,408400,Ooh okay! I love drawing cats! I just love cats in general.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,408400,409680,It’s gonna be great!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,409680,412320,What is she doing? Is she just writing the word “cat?”
0LVgvVnw8Sg,412960,415840,What? Oh my gosh. I’m gonna win this one for sure!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,415840,418160,Okay. Time to use my kitty drawing skills!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,418160,420720,"I’ll start with a circle. Cats can be round, of course."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,420720,422640,Especially if he’s a chonky boi.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,423163,424880,Hmm…where should I go from here?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,424880,427520,Time to turn my word into something even better!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,427520,430960,I’ll start with this little face. Can’t forget the whiskers of course.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,430960,432160,Okay. Head is done!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,432160,434640,"A big, long swoop for his back and his tail."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,434640,435680,So cute!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,435680,437360,Whoa! Good job!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,437920,439040,Let me see your kitties.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,439317,441599,Ta-dah! Here’s my finished kitty!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,441600,445480,"And, well… I guess here’s mine too. I got distracted…"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,445480,450720,"Oh. Well, you can’t win with unfinished art. So, the winner is obvious!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,450720,454480,WOW! I did it! My and my kitty won another round!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,454480,457040,Yes! Cookies! I love cookies!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,458720,462400,"Okay, for your last challenge…draw me a butterfly!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,462960,466479,Okay. I can do this. I know I can. Or…maybe I can’t?
0LVgvVnw8Sg,466480,469760,"Wait, no! I’ve got a good idea now! This should totally work."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,469760,473600,I’ll just start by tracing the shape of this roll of tape. Heh. That rhymed.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,473600,476320,"Okay, that should be good enough. Now I need another one here."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,476320,479520,"It’s not that hard, tracing. But I still don’t want to mess up."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,479520,480240,"Oh, like that."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,481200,485200,Huh? What’s she doing? Ohhh! I get it! That’s smart!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,485200,488240,"But while she’s doing that, I’ve got my own tracing plan!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,488240,490720,Here’s the cute picture of the butterfly she wants us to draw.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,490720,492720,I can just put this paper over the tablet.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,492720,495040,And now I can just trace the picture like this!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,495040,498560,"Wings are done. Now onto the body and head. Oh, the antennae!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,498560,501360,Time to make these wings absolutely gorge!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,501360,504879,This yellow and pink really go well together. I like them a lot.
0LVgvVnw8Sg,504880,507120,Whoa! How did you even do that?!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,507120,510400,Stop! Time to reveal to me your artwork!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,510400,512640,"Okay, well…I went with a caterpillar."
0LVgvVnw8Sg,512640,516640,"Oh! Well, she has an ACTUAL butterfly picture! Nice work!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,517200,520719,"Yeah, but look! My caterpillar metamorphosized!"
0LVgvVnw8Sg,520719,524480,Oh! Well color me impressed! You’re both winners!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,524480,528000,Yes! I love it when we both win! That’s the best!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,528000,530880,Look! We got gum this time! And we don’t even have to share!
0LVgvVnw8Sg,530880,532552,Yay! We’re winners!
