QyMVTpzkx68,12799,19600,if you don't get over that you're doomed  because what happens is this  you start to create a whole bunch of

QyMVTpzkx68,303759,309360,money does buy a form of happiness  because without it you're [ __ ]  miserable but once
QyMVTpzkx68,309360,316240,i realized  it doesn't mean [ __ ]  it doesn't mean [ __ ] for me
QyMVTpzkx68,316240,322240,while it helps you  it also hurts you to come from darkness  because why it's easy for me to sit back
QyMVTpzkx68,322240,328320,and say you know what  poopy pants mentality  i want to sit back

QyMVTpzkx68,364880,370240,that darkness is there's nothing that  dark  to drive me the places i had to go to
QyMVTpzkx68,370240,375280,become successful  on the flip side of that if you come  from a silver spoon family
QyMVTpzkx68,375280,381120,you have to realize that  you have to realize [ __ ]  there's people out there like david
QyMVTpzkx68,381120,387199,goggins  who had  nothing  [ __ ] nothing
QyMVTpzkx68,387199,393680,and i've had all this opportunity in  front of me and i'm a loser  i'm not [ __ ] so what does it say about
QyMVTpzkx68,393680,399039,me the conversations are very similar  you have all this opportunity and you've
QyMVTpzkx68,399039,405199,gone nowhere with it i'm at the bottom  of the barrel and it could take me a lot  longer just to get where you're at for
QyMVTpzkx68,405199,410639,the for the starting line to be fair  there's a barrier in your brain
QyMVTpzkx68,410639,417680,there's a barrier  you got to find out  what  kind of removes that barrier from your
QyMVTpzkx68,417680,423360,brain  my biggest barrier was my father  and once i removed that barrier
QyMVTpzkx68,423360,429840,i was free  to think  and once i felt good about myself
QyMVTpzkx68,429840,435360,i was free to put action in  i never felt good about myself
QyMVTpzkx68,435360,441840,i never felt good by myself whenever i  would get somewhere the demon would come  back put me right back in the cage if
QyMVTpzkx68,441840,447680,you don't go back like  i'm a runner  left knee hurts a lot of people focus on
QyMVTpzkx68,447680,454000,that [ __ ] left knee  a lot of times it's your [ __ ] right  hip  and that's about life
QyMVTpzkx68,454000,460960,you gotta figure out what has messed you  up mentally go to the source go to the  origin of the source
QyMVTpzkx68,460960,466960,when goggins live with me his rule is we  had to do something every day that suck  and anybody not just navy seals but
QyMVTpzkx68,466960,473680,anybody that can accomplish anything  that is hard most of us fail in life  because we're afraid of what everyone
QyMVTpzkx68,473680,480639,around you is thinking we waste so much  time on our little gadgets  it's unreal and we tell that we have no
QyMVTpzkx68,480639,486560,time don't hit the snooze button  why don't you hit this news button  because you wake up already failing
QyMVTpzkx68,486560,492400,because motivation is crap motivation  comes and goes  when you're driven whatever's in front
QyMVTpzkx68,492400,499440,of you will get destroyed life's about  self-discipline is about self-discipline  we tend to do the things that are easy
QyMVTpzkx68,499440,505440,it feels no mental toughness if there's  no mental hardening it feels nothing  they see me now
QyMVTpzkx68,505440,511840,they see me now as the guy that with  this shirt off who can do 4 000 30  pull-ups in 17 hours you can run 205
QyMVTpzkx68,511840,517760,miles in 39 hours who can do all this  crazy [ __ ] but what they don't  understand is they don't understand the
QyMVTpzkx68,517760,522320,journey  that it took me to get to this point
QyMVTpzkx68,525360,533120,never forget to train your [ __ ] mind  in life a lot was work our [ __ ] ass  off trying to get to a better place
QyMVTpzkx68,533120,538959,a place that makes us feel better about  ourselves some people want to do ultra  racist they're starting to pr during
QyMVTpzkx68,538959,545600,training some people want to be a lawyer  or a medical student so they're taking  these practice tests and they're [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,545600,551200,crushing the practice test but guess  what happens  once you get to the actual [ __ ] event
QyMVTpzkx68,551200,556800,your mind isn't ready your mind's not  prepared you've been studying you've  been training you've been working out
QyMVTpzkx68,556800,562080,but your mind's not prepared story for  you when i was 19 years old going  through the air force trying to be a

QyMVTpzkx68,567519,573040,best in the class but the second the  [ __ ] off-guard  if you want to be great
QyMVTpzkx68,573040,579360,you want to be the best [ __ ]  ever at which you do  you could be misunderstood by everybody
QyMVTpzkx68,579360,585600,because you're going to be so [ __ ]  obsessed and so driven to get there  that's what it takes takes every second  of your [ __ ] life anybody says
QyMVTpzkx68,585600,591519,balance yeah balance is important for a  lot of [ __ ] people it is but if you  want to [ __ ] go to that edge where
QyMVTpzkx68,591519,598000,people do not like you don't understand  you question everything you [ __ ] do  you you've arrived
QyMVTpzkx68,598000,604560,when you are misunderstood to the point  where [ __ ] people think you're psycho  and you're nuts and you're this and that  why are you in the [ __ ] gym at one
QyMVTpzkx68,604560,610399,o'clock in the [ __ ] morning you just  got through doing a op  for [ __ ] 13 14 hours after ranger
QyMVTpzkx68,610399,617200,school man  at the gym was wrong you will never  understand what is wrong with me
QyMVTpzkx68,617200,624560,and that's why  i'm so [ __ ] glad you don't because  i'm in the right [ __ ] spot when  people don't understand you anymore
QyMVTpzkx68,624560,630480,you're in that spot  of obsession and drive where people like  what the [ __ ] is wrong with this guy
QyMVTpzkx68,630480,636079,i don't want to talk to you man because  you're not going to get it  you're not the smartest person in school
QyMVTpzkx68,636079,643200,i had that issue  so my big thing was how i addressed that  problem was  each thing that is wrong with you has to
QyMVTpzkx68,643200,648560,be a focal point  you can't look at this gigantic list and  say i gotta change all this [ __ ] my god
QyMVTpzkx68,648560,653760,this is crazy no you take off the first  one i want to be smarter for me that was
QyMVTpzkx68,653760,658959,my thing i have to i have to become more  intelligent  i have such a severe learning disability
QyMVTpzkx68,658959,667120,i can't retain [ __ ]  i had to now get that one thing  and then strategize in that one problem
QyMVTpzkx68,667120,672720,how can i do this i'm not gonna learn  like you i'm not gonna learn like  anybody else how am i gonna figure this
QyMVTpzkx68,672720,679519,out so i then figured out okay  where are my strengths here where my  weaknesses in learning all right man
QyMVTpzkx68,679519,686079,how am i going to do this and i figured  out  a way to do it  but it's strategizing so how i learn to
QyMVTpzkx68,686079,692399,this day  if i have a big manual to study  i will have to get a bunch of spiral
QyMVTpzkx68,692399,697839,notebooks  from the from the daggone store  and each page
QyMVTpzkx68,697839,705040,i have to write each page out maybe 10  times  so there was a thousand page dive manual
QyMVTpzkx68,705040,710079,that i got 18 months before i went to  dive school  most people
QyMVTpzkx68,710079,715920,i'm not smart i'm a ghost if i can pass  this test i realized hang on a second  i'm not smart
QyMVTpzkx68,715920,722079,how can i get past this how can i get  through this obstacle i need to get i  need to acquire this book 18 months in
QyMVTpzkx68,722079,728800,advance because it could take me 18  months to write down  each page over and over again to then
QyMVTpzkx68,728800,735920,put it to memory so when the question  came up  i had written that question so many  times down in that in on you know on
QyMVTpzkx68,735920,742000,paper that i can recall okay page  71 was where i remember seeing this
QyMVTpzkx68,742000,747279,and i can recall it that way and that's  how i did it so you got to strategize on
QyMVTpzkx68,747279,753040,each problem you have in life  slowly break down that problem don't  think about all the problems you have
QyMVTpzkx68,753040,758800,just one at a time  and before you know it you fix all these  problems but you cannot focus on all of
QyMVTpzkx68,758800,764959,them just on the one thing at a time  so today i decided to try to pr my long
QyMVTpzkx68,764959,770320,run  so the first half of the run i'm feeling  great my mind is clear nothing going on
QyMVTpzkx68,770320,777680,think about nothing but my just my  running pace what i'm doing my breathing  everything like that  get to mile 15 i turn around and the
QyMVTpzkx68,777680,783360,demons start to creep in that inevitable  wall is creeping up on me when you push  so hard
QyMVTpzkx68,783360,788399,something's about to give and i started  to give  my mind started to break down i started
QyMVTpzkx68,788399,794800,feeling my legs starting to hurt  i started feeling dehydrated started  feeling sorry for myself start looking
QyMVTpzkx68,794800,801760,around  no one knows i'm [ __ ] out here  running why don't you go ahead and just  stop call your girl have a pick you up
QyMVTpzkx68,801760,807360,and that's not like a little [ __ ] and  this is when your mind has to [ __ ]  change you gotta start thinking i'm the
QyMVTpzkx68,807360,813040,grittiest [ __ ] in the world your  dehydration  [ __ ] it lick your [ __ ] lips
QyMVTpzkx68,813040,818240,your [ __ ] legs are all sore you  [ __ ] got shin splints and stress  fractures no you don't you got sore
QyMVTpzkx68,818240,824800,[ __ ] legs get out of your head and  stay hard  life beat me the [ __ ] up
QyMVTpzkx68,824800,831760,bad i mean i was uh knocked out in the  12th round of a 15 round you know
QyMVTpzkx68,831760,837680,heavyweight bout  i was knocked out  but what happened was in the 12th round
QyMVTpzkx68,837680,843760,when the challenger turned his back on  me i was getting the [ __ ] up  and i got up and won the next three  rounds and knocked out my forgotten the
QyMVTpzkx68,843760,850880,15th round so that's my mind about can't  hurt me i was hurt man  like literally i had to overcome so much
QyMVTpzkx68,850880,856000,those first  26 years of my life  and i still do every day today you know
QyMVTpzkx68,856000,862160,it's not over  but the mentality of can't hurt me is  just that  no matter what's in front of you man you
QyMVTpzkx68,862160,868079,have to face  you have to confront  you have to overcome and move forward so
QyMVTpzkx68,868079,874240,my father you know some of the kids that  bullied me my learning disabilities all  these things i went through in life
QyMVTpzkx68,874240,879279,stuttering  you know had so many different issues  failing and failing and failing i'd
QyMVTpzkx68,879279,885040,overcome them  or they would've overcame me  people have a a hard thing understand i
QyMVTpzkx68,885040,890720,hate to run and and what makes me so  crazy it doesn't need more is people go
QyMVTpzkx68,890720,896560,why do you run if you hate it what are  you talking about  i don't want to take showers and eat
QyMVTpzkx68,896560,903279,either i hate that too the whole that's  a life man  it wasn't until i changed that mentality
QyMVTpzkx68,903279,908399,that i became somebody  i hated going to school so guess what i  was dumb as [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,908399,913680,but if you can get through  to doing things that you hate to do
QyMVTpzkx68,913680,920959,on the other side is greatness  that's what people understand  by me running i am callous in my mind
QyMVTpzkx68,920959,927040,i'm not training for a race i'm training  for life i'm training for the time when  i get that two o'clock in the morning
QyMVTpzkx68,927040,933920,call that my mom is dead or something  happens  tragic in life  i don't fall apart
QyMVTpzkx68,933920,939680,i'm training my mind and my body my  spirit so it's all one so i can handle  what life is gonna throw at me because

QyMVTpzkx68,1019519,1024880,knew nothing about ultra marathons i  hadn't even run a marathon i knew  nothing about this world
QyMVTpzkx68,1024880,1032640,so i googled that you know the top 10  hardest races in the world and what  comes up is a bad water 135. so her 35
QyMVTpzkx68,1032640,1037678,mile race through death valley in the  summertime  i thought it was a stage race
QyMVTpzkx68,1037678,1042720,i thought it was a race where you run  like 20 miles set up camp you know
QyMVTpzkx68,1042720,1047760,barbecue outside and then go run some  more the next day  so i called the race director up at the
QyMVTpzkx68,1047760,1053440,race and said hey chris his name is  chris costen i want to do your race so  we had a long conversation you know i
QyMVTpzkx68,1053440,1061360,was i was much heavier than  and i hadn't put running shoes on over a  year i'm around between 240 to 270. my
QyMVTpzkx68,1061360,1067520,my weight has buried a lot through the  seal teams and out of this hill team so  i was a heavy guy but the long and short
QyMVTpzkx68,1067520,1073840,of it all was i hadn't put running shoes  on in over a year i was a big time power  lifter i lifted weights heavy that's
QyMVTpzkx68,1073840,1080320,what i did i just got back home from  iraq went straight to free fall school  and then this happened so i called chris
QyMVTpzkx68,1080320,1086799,kosman up on a wednesday he says look  man the only way you can qualify for my  race is to run a hundred miles at one
QyMVTpzkx68,1086799,1094880,time  in 24 hours or less  there happened to be a race  that saturday so four days later
QyMVTpzkx68,1094880,1101280,and he said if you qualify by running  100 miles or less in 24 hours i will  consider you my race
QyMVTpzkx68,1101280,1106880,i'm gonna cut to the chase  i signed up for this race it's called  the san diego one day where you run
QyMVTpzkx68,1106880,1112799,around a one-mile track for 24 hours to  see many miles you can get my goal was  100 miles
QyMVTpzkx68,1112799,1119280,so  um i got to mile 70  and i cleared 70 miles in like 12-13
QyMVTpzkx68,1119280,1126400,hours pretty quickly but i was done my  feet were broken  i was stress fractured shin splints
QyMVTpzkx68,1126400,1133120,muscles were tearing i was in bad shape  no water didn't know what the hell i was  doing out there had on some tube socks
QyMVTpzkx68,1133120,1139600,it was just ridiculous it was it was a  clown show so  i sat down at mile 70 and at this time i
QyMVTpzkx68,1139600,1146799,was married  and i i looked at my wife and i was like  um  i'm i'm messed up bad
QyMVTpzkx68,1146799,1153679,so i literally start to turn white and  when a black guy turns white you're  pretty [ __ ] up here i am i'm all
QyMVTpzkx68,1153679,1159440,[ __ ] up in this chair  i'm at mile seven if i got 35 miles to  go i'm jacked up i got to go to the
QyMVTpzkx68,1159440,1167039,bathroom the bathroom's like 20 feet  from me it's a porta potty i can't get  out of the chair so i'm peeing blood
QyMVTpzkx68,1167039,1173120,down my leg  pooping up my back  and i got 30 miles to go
QyMVTpzkx68,1173120,1179440,and i'm i can't stand up because my my  blood pressure's all messed up i've been  in three hell weeks ranger school
QyMVTpzkx68,1179440,1185280,overcome so many obstacles in my life  this last 30 miles of this race
QyMVTpzkx68,1185280,1191360,is when i realized  a human being  is not so human anymore
QyMVTpzkx68,1191360,1197120,we have the ability to go in such a  space  if you're willing to suffer
QyMVTpzkx68,1197120,1205039,and i mean suffer your brain and your  body once connected together can do  anything and this 30 miles was the
QyMVTpzkx68,1205039,1211120,life-changing moment  i was out of it i was in the worst pain  in my entire life
QyMVTpzkx68,1211120,1217440,i was to me  on the brink of death  and i was able to chunk this 30 damn
QyMVTpzkx68,1217440,1222640,miles  into small pieces i was so driven  and i'm not gonna say motivated because
QyMVTpzkx68,1222640,1228240,motivation is crap motivation comes and  goes  when you're driven whatever's in front
QyMVTpzkx68,1228240,1234480,of you will get destroyed  so  i sat in this chair and i was so driven
QyMVTpzkx68,1234480,1241039,to succeed in this race and at this time  everybody goes were you thinking about  the guys that died and
QyMVTpzkx68,1241039,1246960,i'm not gonna lie to you i wasn't  this became a personal thing
QyMVTpzkx68,1246960,1253679,this became me against this race me  against the kids that called me [ __ ]  me against me  it it it just became something that i
QyMVTpzkx68,1253679,1259520,took so  so violently personal  and i broke this thing down into small
QyMVTpzkx68,1259520,1264559,pieces i said okay i got to get  nutrition i gotta be able to stand up  before i can get off this curb and get
QyMVTpzkx68,1264559,1270720,off this chair and be able to go 30  miles  so i went through all these small steps  and i was able to stand up
QyMVTpzkx68,1270720,1276480,and then from staying up  i was literally walking around with my  wife at the time and she goes you're not
QyMVTpzkx68,1276480,1281520,gonna make the time she goes you're  running you're you're walking like 37  minute miles
QyMVTpzkx68,1281520,1289840,i got to mile 81  and the second she said that i'm not  going to make the time  i ran the last 19 miles
QyMVTpzkx68,1289840,1296799,and i can show you right now when we get  done with this matter of fact i'm going  to show you right now  this was years ago
QyMVTpzkx68,1296799,1302880,and i had to put compression tape  and i had so this was years ago
QyMVTpzkx68,1302880,1310080,i had literally the size of half dollars  i had to get compression tape
QyMVTpzkx68,1310080,1315679,and i taped up my ankles and i taped up  my feet  and that's how i got through that race
QyMVTpzkx68,1315679,1321919,so i literally went through all the buds  my last seal training with stretch  fractures and shin splints and how i did
QyMVTpzkx68,1321919,1327919,it was i would take my ankles  all the way up to my calf every morning  so for the first hour
QyMVTpzkx68,1327919,1335200,the pain was excruciating but what  happened is my feet would go numb  and i did that every single day for six
QyMVTpzkx68,1335200,1340720,months  that's how i got through my third  healthy because i was so broken from the  first two
QyMVTpzkx68,1340720,1346240,that the commander said hey the ceo said  this your last time we're sending you  through so that's how i got the idea to
QyMVTpzkx68,1346240,1354159,do that so  with the right and people may listen to  this and say  this guy is sadistic he's crazy he's
QyMVTpzkx68,1354159,1359760,no if you know how i came up  you realize i was just  a scared kid
QyMVTpzkx68,1359760,1365520,that found drive and passion to be  something much better than what he  thought he was that's all it is
QyMVTpzkx68,1365520,1371120,self-talk  and visualization are the two keys to my  success
QyMVTpzkx68,1371120,1378080,i believed  for that last time 19 miles  i was indestructible because i took
QyMVTpzkx68,1378080,1384080,myself in that chair  crapping up my back peeing blood on my  leg shin splint stretch fractures
QyMVTpzkx68,1384080,1391039,i use all that for motivation versus  negativity i use it for motivation i i  said to myself who on this
QyMVTpzkx68,1391039,1397520,earth  would still be going right now  you are
QyMVTpzkx68,1397520,1403280,you are  you got to be the hardest  on the planet is it true i don't give a
QyMVTpzkx68,1403280,1408960,[ __ ]  at that time  it got me to the finish line of that
QyMVTpzkx68,1408960,1415679,race  i believed it  i believe it today  i believed it enough to where my body
QyMVTpzkx68,1415679,1421600,said  he's not going to stop  and that's i took all the negative
QyMVTpzkx68,1421600,1427120,things i need to go to the hospital this  and that  and i use uh who the hell could even get
QyMVTpzkx68,1427120,1432480,on that chair you did  who the hell would you even think about  taping stress fractures up
QyMVTpzkx68,1432480,1439919,you did  all those things i used for motivation  this voice in my head guided me to the
QyMVTpzkx68,1439919,1445360,spot where i'm at today  and if you don't believe that you're  here for a reason your life will
QyMVTpzkx68,1445360,1450480,seriously hurt  and i started looking at my life and all  this [ __ ] i went through
QyMVTpzkx68,1450480,1456400,as god put me some god whatever you  believe and put me here  to go through this
QyMVTpzkx68,1456400,1461840,and now i see all the hundreds of  thousands of lives i'm changing  by the hell i went through
QyMVTpzkx68,1461840,1467440,there's a lot of power in that so my  purpose as i started going through this  journey instead of looking at like what
QyMVTpzkx68,1467440,1472559,was me god man why why the [ __ ] man why  why  i started looking at
QyMVTpzkx68,1472559,1477600,it's the perfect training ground  you knew exactly what you were doing  you know exactly what the [ __ ] you were
QyMVTpzkx68,1477600,1482720,doing obviously you put me in every  situation possible to tell a story
QyMVTpzkx68,1482720,1490000,that needed to be told i mean it was a  very scary scary road  a guy who was afraid of a lot of things
QyMVTpzkx68,1490000,1496799,to then find power and fear  to find power and overcoming fear and to  get where i'm at today where there's
QyMVTpzkx68,1496799,1501840,very few things i'm really afraid of  because i know how to control it i know  how to manage it i know how to work it
QyMVTpzkx68,1501840,1508480,to my advantage now  it's it's something else man so i really  challenge people to really
QyMVTpzkx68,1508480,1513840,do a live autopsy on your brain  and the reason why i talk about my  childhood so much in this because i
QyMVTpzkx68,1513840,1519200,don't want you to put a title on me  because once you title me as
QyMVTpzkx68,1519200,1525520,a freak  you now put yourself in a position where  you can be very comfortable in saying
QyMVTpzkx68,1525520,1531120,it's just not possible for me the thing  that makes me so pissed off in this  world man the one thing the only thing
QyMVTpzkx68,1531120,1536960,gets me mad nowadays is that so many  people die with untapped potential  because they think that someone else is
QyMVTpzkx68,1536960,1543440,[ __ ] better than them  and they were born  you know not with the greatest tools
QyMVTpzkx68,1543440,1550159,you don't need [ __ ]  you need the ability to [ __ ] grind  your ass into a fine [ __ ] powder and
QyMVTpzkx68,1550159,1556640,when that fire powder find a way to  build that [ __ ] back up  repeatedly  and it's possible
QyMVTpzkx68,1556640,1563200,you were bullied  do you remember how many nights you  spent by yourself and your [ __ ] head
QyMVTpzkx68,1563200,1568480,thinking about what kind of piece of  [ __ ] you were  and how miserable that [ __ ] was
QyMVTpzkx68,1568480,1575279,that's exactly my drive i know that  there's not just me and you  there's millions and millions especially
QyMVTpzkx68,1575279,1582080,nowadays  with  all this [ __ ] pressure man you you  you can you can now bully a [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,1582080,1589120,on your phone you you know but you know  back in our day it was face to face you  can do everything over your phone the
QyMVTpzkx68,1589120,1594880,the the pressures  of trying to keep up with everything is  at an all-time high
QyMVTpzkx68,1594880,1601279,and  our mindsets are at an all-time low  we are the weakest we've been mentally
QyMVTpzkx68,1601279,1607120,ever  since since beginning of time  and it's even harder so it's harder with
QyMVTpzkx68,1607120,1613520,a weaker mind  so all i want to do my my whole drive is  about i have a really good way of
QyMVTpzkx68,1613520,1620880,visualizing people suffering because a  lot of people do it we have two sides of  us we have one side that is
QyMVTpzkx68,1620880,1627120,that happy-go-lucky side that nothing's  wrong and everything is good but we have  that sign at home
QyMVTpzkx68,1627120,1634320,but no one's around  that's depressed and miserable and we're  not good enough  and whatever happened to you is real
QyMVTpzkx68,1634320,1640640,so  that's my drive i want to make sure that  i give people as much power as i can
QyMVTpzkx68,1640640,1647279,so when they get up every [ __ ]  morning they know that hey  i have the ability to not only survive
QyMVTpzkx68,1647279,1653880,in this world but thrive in this world  just by the mere fact of hearing about  my story
QyMVTpzkx68,1658640,1666640,we all look for toughness we all want it  but we look for in a comfortable  environment you will not find toughness
QyMVTpzkx68,1666640,1672960,in a comfortable environment you want  people who are honest with you who are  going to tell you what is honest honest
QyMVTpzkx68,1672960,1678000,and truthful people the most important  conversation you'll ever have is the one  you have with yourself you wake up with
QyMVTpzkx68,1678000,1683440,it you walk around with it eventually  you act on it and my self-talk was most
QyMVTpzkx68,1683440,1688960,disgusting self-talk of all time you got  to start diving into those things that  you are afraid of you don't gain
QyMVTpzkx68,1688960,1694720,confidence by going to the spot that  makes you feel good it's going to be a  false reality but you overcome those
QyMVTpzkx68,1694720,1701679,fears guess what happens the whole world  you unlock this door and everything  opens back up again i made this person i
QyMVTpzkx68,1701679,1707360,made this person by diving into the  insecurities that life gave me
QyMVTpzkx68,1708320,1714159,what if  a lot of times i'll be in a 200 mile run  or something like that and i'm all
QyMVTpzkx68,1714159,1720960,jacked up body's broken mind's broken  spirit's broken i start to say what if i  can pull this off when i first walked
QyMVTpzkx68,1720960,1727039,into the navy seal recruiter's office he  looked at me and said there's only been  35 african americans in 70 years make it
QyMVTpzkx68,1727039,1732240,through  you know i said to myself  what if i can be the 36th
QyMVTpzkx68,1732240,1739200,it's the what if  i can pull off a miracle  what if i can become someone that no one
QyMVTpzkx68,1739200,1745120,thinks i can be and just that just me  talking about that  i have the hair going up on my arms so
QyMVTpzkx68,1745120,1751200,many people before i give them a workout  plan let's talk about recovery everybody  everybody that hears me speak
QyMVTpzkx68,1751200,1757840,they want to go straight to recovery  work out first we are always looking for  like whenever i talk to people people
QyMVTpzkx68,1757840,1764240,take my words and they put it in a way  to where  they want to feel comfortable this guy
QyMVTpzkx68,1764240,1769520,you know they they they want to put you  in a box  they want to put a title on you
QyMVTpzkx68,1769520,1775360,no you're putting a title on me to make  yourself feel better about yourself if  you read this book of mine you see where
QyMVTpzkx68,1775360,1780399,i came from i made this person  i made this person by diving in to the
QyMVTpzkx68,1780399,1786720,insecurities that life gave me because  now they're yours they're yours to own  if you're not smart
QyMVTpzkx68,1786720,1792000,call yourself dumb  it's okay because you are  but take that knowledge you put yourself
QyMVTpzkx68,1792000,1797679,down if you're fat car you're so fat i  used to be 300 pounds  we we want to talk so soft to ourselves
QyMVTpzkx68,1797679,1803039,we're looking for that recovery day and  that recovery day is everything in your  life everything in your life is a
QyMVTpzkx68,1803039,1808640,recovery day we're looking for it's not  coming it's not coming get over that  recovery day
QyMVTpzkx68,1808640,1815600,and that's the mentality i took with me  and what happened through that process  was all the frivolous things of life
QyMVTpzkx68,1815600,1822000,started to float away i used to tell  people lies so they would like me  because i was so insecure when you start
QyMVTpzkx68,1822000,1829039,to build yourself up  and start to have the one thing that we  don't have is confidence real
QyMVTpzkx68,1829039,1835200,authentic confidence from hard work  you now know  i walk in the room now and i know that
QyMVTpzkx68,1835200,1840799,hours and years and decades  i put into david goggins  that's something
QyMVTpzkx68,1840799,1847200,it's not on the wall  it's not a trophy on the wall it's not a  mellow on your neck  it is actually a feeling in your heart i
QyMVTpzkx68,1847200,1854240,don't care how you perceive david  goggins because through my journey i  figured out the one piece i was missing
QyMVTpzkx68,1854240,1860399,i thought it was cars i thought it was  women that was everything the one piece  i was missing was me having the courage
QyMVTpzkx68,1860399,1866159,to face myself  and once you do that on a daily basis  it's not about the running
QyMVTpzkx68,1866159,1873760,work people are going to be just not  working out where i got my work ethic  from  was the hours i had to stand learning
QyMVTpzkx68,1873760,1879600,this  when you sit down and you're not smart  you have a disability
QyMVTpzkx68,1879600,1886080,and you still want to be at the top of  your class i want to get by  when i realized that i can learn through
QyMVTpzkx68,1886080,1892640,hard work  and i can beat the valedictorian in  school but i got put in 10 hours more a
QyMVTpzkx68,1892640,1898320,day than he does you know what kind of  strength comes from that when you're  sitting down that guy that that value of
QyMVTpzkx68,1898320,1905519,20 study for an hour and you know i  caught you  i caught you and i am dumb but i have
QyMVTpzkx68,1905519,1911279,the work ethic to catch you that's where  david gaga's got really invented is that
QyMVTpzkx68,1911279,1918000,having a discipline every day to say for  me to learn this one math problem  it's gonna take me 10 hours
QyMVTpzkx68,1918000,1923120,and that's where it and you realize  through hard work you can do you can out
QyMVTpzkx68,1923120,1928240,work anybody remember how badass they  are  but that's the part people don't want to
QyMVTpzkx68,1928240,1936799,dive into some people didn't understand  when i say i'm training for life  2020 was the perfect example of that
QyMVTpzkx68,1936799,1943039,a lot of people lost jobs  lost businesses  lost family members
QyMVTpzkx68,1943039,1949200,a lot of folks spent a lot of time in  the hospital on ventilators  should have caused a lot of demons in

QyMVTpzkx68,2140720,2147200,you know what because  first of all it does set you free  mentally and it gives you a starting
QyMVTpzkx68,2147200,2154480,point  you have to have the truth  to have a starting point  so when you like if if i'm lying to you
QyMVTpzkx68,2154480,2160960,about who i am or i'm lying to you about  whatever there's no starting point  there's a false reality
QyMVTpzkx68,2160960,2166720,you have to create the real reality so  that's what i call my accountability  mirror in my book
QyMVTpzkx68,2166720,2172480,that's the real reality where the am i  going to start from  so for me i was lying to this lying
QyMVTpzkx68,2172480,2178320,about that  so i had no starting point  once you come face to face with who you
QyMVTpzkx68,2178320,2183839,are  you have a starting point all right  i'm not real smart
QyMVTpzkx68,2183839,2189599,i have no courage i have no self-esteem  i have no nothing
QyMVTpzkx68,2189599,2195359,nothing  that's my starting point now we can move  from there but if i tell myself i'm
QyMVTpzkx68,2195359,2200960,strong i have courage i'm smart and all  these are lies
QyMVTpzkx68,2200960,2207760,you continuously push that starting  point backwards  so that starting point is the truth
QyMVTpzkx68,2207760,2213440,the no  [ __ ] truth  that only you can tell yourself
QyMVTpzkx68,2213440,2219119,so it's the starting point the truth's  the starting point especially nowadays  in this society we like to surround
QyMVTpzkx68,2219119,2224720,ourselves  it makes us feel so good those people  who say it's okay
QyMVTpzkx68,2224720,2231200,it's okay it's not okay  it isn't okay man and i and i get it  society's changing
QyMVTpzkx68,2231200,2237520,and we love to feel wanted and loved  trust me that's all important it is
QyMVTpzkx68,2237520,2243920,but  you have to have the truth from people  hey  you're not working your butt off hard  enough you're not trying hard enough we
QyMVTpzkx68,2243920,2250240,all think we're trying hard but what are  you gauging that off of are you gazing  off of like i talked to this one kid the
QyMVTpzkx68,2250240,2255280,other day  college is kicking my ass  i said what are you gazing at off of i
QyMVTpzkx68,2255280,2261440,go are you trying because yeah i'm  trying my ass off i'm studying hard i go  what are you engaging trying hard off of
QyMVTpzkx68,2261440,2267119,well in high school i didn't have to try  at all  and i made great grades
QyMVTpzkx68,2267119,2272640,in college  i'm trying hard you're trying hard  compared to what you did in high school
QyMVTpzkx68,2272640,2277680,which was it came easy to you  so your reality is something you created
QyMVTpzkx68,2277680,2283280,off of something easy so you trying hard  is two hours of studying  i'm gonna tell you a difference in
QyMVTpzkx68,2283280,2289599,trying hard and trying hard  trying hard is something in your mind  just doesn't stop
QyMVTpzkx68,2289599,2295200,we  know two hours isn't enough  so it's all about you know reality and
QyMVTpzkx68,2295200,2300240,what you're basing things off of when i  was 297 pounds and i was fat as hell
QyMVTpzkx68,2300240,2306640,trying to be a navy seal the scariest  thing in the world to me even to this  day  was that that could have been the rest
QyMVTpzkx68,2306640,2315040,of my life i thought then i was trying  hard that's the scariest thing in the  world i thought then 297 pound
QyMVTpzkx68,2315040,2321119,working for eco lab spraying for  cockroaches making a thousand dollars a  month i thought that was me
QyMVTpzkx68,2321119,2328000,at my 100 potential  come to find out a few years later
QyMVTpzkx68,2328000,2333359,i wasn't anywhere near that 106 pounds  less  graduate navy still training we don't do
QyMVTpzkx68,2333359,2339520,all these other things looking back on  that that was me trying hard that's why  people got to understand
QyMVTpzkx68,2339520,2344720,what is in us  we have no idea until we start trying
QyMVTpzkx68,2344720,2350079,hard  and i mean really trying hard where  you're obsessed with hey this is my new
QyMVTpzkx68,2350079,2355280,norm my new norm is that wow  this isn't always fun
QyMVTpzkx68,2355280,2362320,it's not always meant to be fun  and that's when you know you're trying  hard  when i was in ranger school
QyMVTpzkx68,2362320,2367520,my squad got spot checked  the ranger instructor was looking for  three items
QyMVTpzkx68,2367520,2374800,one of my guys didn't have the items  so the whole squad got smoked  the ri was sitting there smoking us
QyMVTpzkx68,2374800,2380720,and the more he smoked us the more my  squad looked around looking for someone  to motivate him
QyMVTpzkx68,2380720,2387040,the ranger instructor shouted out i'm  going to bury you  so i saw that my squad needed some extra
QyMVTpzkx68,2387040,2392640,motivation  that's why i said ain't no grave that  can hold us down whether
QyMVTpzkx68,2392640,2398560,ain't no grave that can hold us down  right now in life  your family is looking for that one guy
QyMVTpzkx68,2398560,2404880,right now you're looking for that one  guy  who's strong  who's that pillar for the family in hard
QyMVTpzkx68,2404880,2410480,times  make sure they look around they look  around and find you these are the times
QyMVTpzkx68,2410480,2416160,right now for you to step up  be that guy that can take anything stay  hard
QyMVTpzkx68,2416160,2422160,this is the world that is in front of me  and what most people do is they see this  world
QyMVTpzkx68,2422160,2428240,and they look at it as an excuse to get  out of it i started looking at it  as
QyMVTpzkx68,2428240,2433359,this is the ultimate training ground for  the rest of my life i have all these
QyMVTpzkx68,2433359,2438880,valuable lessons because if you look at  the world right now today it's not a  nice place but i'm very prepared for it
QyMVTpzkx68,2438880,2444560,i'm prepared for all the failure coming  my way i'm prepared for everything my  way and that's the biggest lesson that
QyMVTpzkx68,2444560,2450240,she taught me by not teaching you  by never saying it's gonna be okay
QyMVTpzkx68,2450240,2455760,matter of fact she told me the exact  opposite life sucks  that's what she knew
QyMVTpzkx68,2455760,2460800,it was the truth  and so i started at that point in my  life i have a lot more failures as you
QyMVTpzkx68,2460800,2467680,see in that book  but i started down the road of instead  of  the path of least resistance
QyMVTpzkx68,2467680,2473040,i started choosing the path of most  resistance to prepare myself for the  journey that was coming my way
QyMVTpzkx68,2473040,2479599,we live in a box  and we don't want to go outside that box  at all ever
QyMVTpzkx68,2479599,2485680,outside that box  is all these possibilities of life  what we do is we shackled our mind we
QyMVTpzkx68,2485680,2491520,are a prisoner in our own mind this is  all i can do this is all i'm good at
QyMVTpzkx68,2491520,2498240,and we we we take away the possibility  you could be this you could be that you  could be all these things
QyMVTpzkx68,2498240,2503680,and i never thought that 300 pounds i  could be negative so if my mind was  shackled there'd be no book there'd be
QyMVTpzkx68,2503680,2510880,nothing  so  what people understand is that they live  for themselves  not knowing that you have the power
QyMVTpzkx68,2510880,2518160,within yourself to change  millions of lives  by facing life by facing yourself
QyMVTpzkx68,2518160,2524960,and through that  i i would die never knowing  that i had the power to change millions
QyMVTpzkx68,2524960,2530640,of lives  i gotta feed myself  and every foot strike that hits the
QyMVTpzkx68,2530640,2537119,pavement  that's how i feed myself  wanna look for inspiration
QyMVTpzkx68,2537119,2545359,this grace is found  in every footstep you take  every grass left iron bar
QyMVTpzkx68,2545359,2550800,all that [ __ ] all the miles in the pool  inspirations found and suffered
QyMVTpzkx68,2550800,2557359,so right now  this is my greatest recovery  as i recover
QyMVTpzkx68,2557359,2563760,i find inspiration  stay hard  i have the ability to see the end
QyMVTpzkx68,2563760,2569680,before the beginning even begins  and what that means is i know that to  get to the very end i can see it right
QyMVTpzkx68,2569680,2576480,now so before i went to butts and i was  losing weight i saw myself walking  across the stage
QyMVTpzkx68,2576480,2583200,at 191 pounds that's what i had to get  to to get into the door  i saw myself
QyMVTpzkx68,2583200,2590560,six months a year later whatever's gonna  take me to do i saw myself walking  across that stage getting that  certificate of graduation from buds
QyMVTpzkx68,2590560,2598079,and i was able to be there  at 300 pounds  and that feeling that i was nowhere near
QyMVTpzkx68,2598079,2603760,that feeling i was able to put myself  there  a million times every day and that
QyMVTpzkx68,2603760,2610560,feeling of like my god that is going to  feel amazing that's what made me suffer
QyMVTpzkx68,2610560,2618400,that's what allowed the pain to be real  and say this is worth it i want to feel  for this next 18 months it took me 18
QyMVTpzkx68,2618400,2624800,months to finally become a navy too to  find me you know just get through butts  18 months six months took me 18.
QyMVTpzkx68,2624800,2630000,that's what woke me up every morning was  i'm gonna put myself through this much
QyMVTpzkx68,2630000,2635359,pain and suffering for a few  seconds  so it is
QyMVTpzkx68,2635359,2640960,a few seconds of joy  it's so [ __ ] worth it man as if  people don't get so i'm able to put
QyMVTpzkx68,2640960,2647200,myself at the finish line even though i  have no finish line  but at the finish line of an event
QyMVTpzkx68,2647200,2652960,before i even start the mother and say  how are you going to fill it into this  visualizing this is my biggest tool of
QyMVTpzkx68,2652960,2658560,life  that's why i i've been able to put  myself in cold water put myself in a
QyMVTpzkx68,2658560,2664079,hundred mile race  millions of times before i've done it  and i'm able to go through the race and
QyMVTpzkx68,2664079,2670720,see i'm going to feel at my 50 almost to  the almost to the exact  exact feeling and that's the one thing i
QyMVTpzkx68,2670720,2677040,practice in practice and practice and  practice overnight but also the most  important thing is i i practice that
QyMVTpzkx68,2677040,2684319,feeling of accomplishment that i'm going  to have it's all said and done with get  a lot of questions  people asking me for help
QyMVTpzkx68,2684319,2692079,so i asked them  what have you done to help yourself  most of them say i've been working hard
QyMVTpzkx68,2692079,2697280,i'm all about being your own hero  but i'm not about kissing your ass in
QyMVTpzkx68,2697280,2704800,life a lot of us believe  that we're working much harder than we  actually are we think if we got up early
QyMVTpzkx68,2704800,2710400,for four days  we've earned something the guy dropped  your entitled mindset
QyMVTpzkx68,2710400,2715520,it's dead weight we believe you work  harder than we actually have  trust me
QyMVTpzkx68,2715520,2722319,most of us haven't  one thing in life you gotta realize is  this  learn to help yourself
QyMVTpzkx68,2722319,2728800,don't count other people to help you  stay hard because i realized once i was
QyMVTpzkx68,2728800,2735359,talking to myself  the right way  and all this [ __ ] wasn't in my mind wow
QyMVTpzkx68,2735359,2742400,i went from this peace  kid who thought he was dumb not  successful insecure who stuttered when i
QyMVTpzkx68,2742400,2748079,first saw somebody  to a person who can now do all these  things just because i now control my own
QyMVTpzkx68,2748079,2754240,mind  i don't care when you get to the point  where you really and don't care you
QyMVTpzkx68,2754240,2759280,become very very dangerous i'm not  saying don't care like i don't care if i
QyMVTpzkx68,2759280,2764960,do that no when you don't care about  other people  and how they view you about how you walk
QyMVTpzkx68,2764960,2770240,how you talk how you dress where you  want to go with your life you know  growing up i didn't want to tell anybody
QyMVTpzkx68,2770240,2775920,i want to be in the military because why  some of my black friends i was afraid of  what they think
QyMVTpzkx68,2775920,2781760,why you want to join the [ __ ]  military man  oh you wanna do that [ __ ]  i was afraid of what other people
QyMVTpzkx68,2781760,2787440,thought about me so now  when i go in the military i know you  want to [ __ ] join the military yeah i  ain't telling you i was afraid what you
QyMVTpzkx68,2787440,2792640,thought once again man you're allowing  other people to shackle your mind and so  it's so it's the worst thing in the
QyMVTpzkx68,2792640,2799520,world let's say for instance we have a  family let's say we're all a big family  here and every morning i'm getting up  training for a 200 mile run and you see

QyMVTpzkx68,2811040,2816640,mediocre there's always those couple of  guys who are uncommon who want to be  better
QyMVTpzkx68,2816640,2822079,but you make that mediocre mother feel  like  whether it's your mom your dad whoever
QyMVTpzkx68,2822079,2829200,you make him feel horrible i've been  there i'm speaking from experience you  get somebody around you man who's trying  to be better and you don't have the
QyMVTpzkx68,2829200,2834720,drive that they have  it's a constant reminder of how  you are

QyMVTpzkx68,2841359,2847760,they have a problem with themselves  because all you're trying to do is  achieve more if that's a problem for  somebody
QyMVTpzkx68,2847760,2854960,you have to look at them and say man  you really have a [ __ ] problem with  yourself huh
QyMVTpzkx68,2855040,2860240,most of this generation quits the second  they get  talked to

QyMVTpzkx68,2956559,2963119,the truth man so the only way i became  successful  was going towards the truth as painful
QyMVTpzkx68,2963119,2969680,and as brutal  as it is  it changed me  it allowed me to become
QyMVTpzkx68,2969680,2975520,in my own right  who i am today  my biggest advice to give everybody in  the world

QyMVTpzkx68,3047760,3053839,the journey starts with you finding why  the hell am i here on this planet earth  why am i here
QyMVTpzkx68,3053839,3060079,if you don't know that you will live the  rest of your life searching  always asking the question why

QyMVTpzkx68,3096319,3103520,because that's all you can be afraid of  once you overcome the reflection in the  mirror  you've done it
QyMVTpzkx68,3103760,3110800,so i get an email the other day  this young man wants to be a ranger he's  afraid to go to ranger school
QyMVTpzkx68,3110800,3116400,not because how hard the training is  but because he's afraid if he fails
QyMVTpzkx68,3116400,3121440,what people are going to say  by judging them  one thing in life this applies to
QyMVTpzkx68,3121440,3127839,everything in life  anytime you move from being normal to  trying to be exceptional
QyMVTpzkx68,3127839,3133680,people aren't gonna like that [ __ ] those  normal people  it makes them feel like [ __ ] so they're  gonna judge you
QyMVTpzkx68,3133680,3139440,and nowadays it's very easy to be a  [ __ ] coward why we got instagram and
QyMVTpzkx68,3139440,3145200,[ __ ]  most folks don't tell you to your face  they go online they post about like
QyMVTpzkx68,3145200,3150319,cowards  don't let cowards get in your [ __ ]  head  and last day
QyMVTpzkx68,3150319,3156400,make sure you do you stay hard  what brings me joy and happiness
QyMVTpzkx68,3156400,3162480,is knowing how beautiful the mind is  and i'm one of the few people
QyMVTpzkx68,3162480,3167839,that didn't read about it  didn't experienced it through some some  drug
QyMVTpzkx68,3167839,3173680,i got to experience the beauty of true  [ __ ] willpower
QyMVTpzkx68,3173680,3179359,true  i'm gonna fail i'm gonna fail i'm gonna
QyMVTpzkx68,3179359,3184559,fail i'm gonna fail  and i will succeed
QyMVTpzkx68,3184559,3189839,just me talking about that gives me a  feeling i know what i did
QyMVTpzkx68,3189839,3197119,and i don't need to travel somewhere or  to have this or have that  i have it all here in my mind
QyMVTpzkx68,3197119,3203359,the beauty is remembering this young  dumb what people called [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,3203359,3209200,is now where i'm at today  and that is when you finally get to that  point for me
QyMVTpzkx68,3209200,3214400,it's forever lasting peace  i do need i could die right now on this
QyMVTpzkx68,3214400,3220400,show  and i'll be happy ma'am so that's my  happiness is is my reflection on
QyMVTpzkx68,3220400,3225839,the suffering of my journey knowing i  never quit nor  was i guided
QyMVTpzkx68,3225839,3231839,by anybody on this earth i was guided by  something much more powerful  and i listened
QyMVTpzkx68,3231839,3237040,and i chose the path of most resistance  talent  not required
QyMVTpzkx68,3237040,3244160,i'm pulling up a lot of the the dark  side of me but i'm also  looking at the guys to my left and to my
QyMVTpzkx68,3244160,3251119,right  realizing that um we're here together  man  and i have to uh i have to be strong for
QyMVTpzkx68,3251119,3257680,them  and they gotta be strong for me  a lot of people either you like me or  don't even in the seal teams
QyMVTpzkx68,3257680,3264319,but when you get to that door or you get  on that mission or you're getting that  op  all that's just out the door man you
QyMVTpzkx68,3264319,3270160,know  you you do it honestly i mean people say  all the time in these movies and [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,3270160,3275520,you you really out there fighting for  that guy beside you and you can't be a  coward
QyMVTpzkx68,3275520,3280799,because you know what this i look at  everything i do now in life and this  sums it up
QyMVTpzkx68,3280799,3287200,i hated jumping out of airplanes  i hated shooting guns  i hated the job as a navy seal
QyMVTpzkx68,3287200,3292799,but i did it because i wanted to  change myself
QyMVTpzkx68,3292799,3299520,everything i do i'm not really  comfortable doing  but if you choose to go that route to go
QyMVTpzkx68,3299520,3305200,be a navy seal you might as well go be  the hardest mother in the world  because if you're choosing to do
QyMVTpzkx68,3305200,3310960,something you have two routes you can go  there and be a little a little weak  person and get through barely and that's
QyMVTpzkx68,3310960,3316640,your reputation  or you can go through  the hardest guy you can possibly be
QyMVTpzkx68,3316640,3322160,that's your reputation so my whole thing  is if you're going to choose to open  that [ __ ] door in iraq or afghanistan
QyMVTpzkx68,3322160,3327440,open the [ __ ] and go in hard  because they're going to remember you
QyMVTpzkx68,3327440,3332640,by slowly opening it and peeking in  so if you're going to open it and you
QyMVTpzkx68,3332640,3338400,made the mind open it don't crack it  open open the [ __ ] door go in that's  with life
QyMVTpzkx68,3338400,3344640,if you choose  if you're choosing to do something  attack it  because they're going to remember you
QyMVTpzkx68,3344640,3350400,as not attacking it so i want to be  remembered you can hate me but one thing  you can't say about me
QyMVTpzkx68,3350400,3355920,i didn't attack it  so that's the mentality you have if  you're going to do something you might  as well attack it because you do it
QyMVTpzkx68,3355920,3362400,anyway  so the accountability mirror is  something that i  kind of came up with in high school like
QyMVTpzkx68,3362400,3369839,i said i started shaving my head when i  was 16  and i got caught up in trying to impress  so many people because no one liked me
QyMVTpzkx68,3369839,3376079,so i developed so many different  identities let me sag my pants  you know let me okay let me pull my
QyMVTpzkx68,3376079,3382400,pants up let me let me talk this way or  act this way or be this way or whatever  the hell it may be god dawg so many
QyMVTpzkx68,3382400,3388799,different things i did to try to fit in  with so many different groups  that
QyMVTpzkx68,3388799,3395920,when you look in the mirror that's the  one person you can't lie to  so every morning i would shave my head  thinking god i reflect back
QyMVTpzkx68,3395920,3401920,on some of the lies i may have told  somebody or some of the ways i acted i  didn't feel comfortable doing and i did
QyMVTpzkx68,3401920,3408799,it to impress other normal people  the key word there is normal everyday  people i was trying to make other people
QyMVTpzkx68,3408799,3415839,like me  how pathetic is that  so  i  that this mirror would always tell me my
QyMVTpzkx68,3415839,3420880,like my reflection would say god you are  a pathetic man  how does that feel every day to be this
QyMVTpzkx68,3420880,3426480,way so i would just start having myself  accountable how how did i attack today
QyMVTpzkx68,3426480,3432480,how did i attack yesterday  and if i didn't do something i was proud  of i write down a sticky note
QyMVTpzkx68,3432480,3436280,and i would fix it
QyMVTpzkx68,3438270,3458240,[Music]
QyMVTpzkx68,3458240,3464079,the reason why we go back to old habits  is because our goals are too lofty  we're not achieving our goals fast
QyMVTpzkx68,3464079,3472400,enough  so what happens is you know what oh man  we're very impatient nowadays for me
QyMVTpzkx68,3472400,3477599,it was good i have a phone  i was i was i was out of this world by
QyMVTpzkx68,3477599,3482720,myself  it was a race against david goggins it  wasn't a race against god i don't look
QyMVTpzkx68,3482720,3489359,good for this person or that person it  was me i got to change myself  so for me if i lost five pounds in a
QyMVTpzkx68,3489359,3494400,week  i got a feeling i allowed myself to feel  proud
QyMVTpzkx68,3494400,3502319,of that  i didn't look i gotta lose 106 pounds  i'm like man i went from 297. now i'm
QyMVTpzkx68,3502319,3508960,292  in one week man i'm i'm killing it  we don't we're not proud of ourselves
QyMVTpzkx68,3508960,3514640,for the small accomplishments  what we need is we need this monstrosity
QyMVTpzkx68,3514640,3520400,of the thing to happen say i did it no  there's a process that you have to go
QyMVTpzkx68,3520400,3527520,through and patience is the process  and if you don't have patience after a  week i haven't lost 30 pounds and i'm
QyMVTpzkx68,3527520,3532960,done i'm over it so that's why i found  out with people man they're not patient  enough to realize and to enjoy the
QyMVTpzkx68,3532960,3539599,moment not living it  just enjoy it there's no finish line in  life but enjoy that moment roger that
QyMVTpzkx68,3539599,3546160,man lost five let me go 10 next week so  that's the whole thing about it that's  how people lose it
QyMVTpzkx68,3546160,3551920,our mind  wants to protect us  the mind is like honestly it has a
QyMVTpzkx68,3551920,3558880,tactical advantage over us  it knows our deepest darkest fears or  insecurities it knows where we start to
QyMVTpzkx68,3558880,3564799,feel  uh we start getting that doubt creeping  it says hey man you know what man maybe  this isn't good let's go back home to
QyMVTpzkx68,3564799,3571359,the wife let's go back home to the kids  this is not comfortable so in that  moment the mind directs us it's a
QyMVTpzkx68,3571359,3576559,protective mechanism it saves us for  doing bodily harm or
QyMVTpzkx68,3576559,3581920,or it really saves us from discovering  that the mind's like i want to be in
QyMVTpzkx68,3581920,3587200,charge of you  i don't want you to be in charge of me  so it tells you let's just stop right
QyMVTpzkx68,3587200,3592880,here  but once you start breaking through that  barrier  and start breaking down that governor
QyMVTpzkx68,3592880,3600640,the governor that you've put in your  mind  because we forget we  are in control of our mind we believe
QyMVTpzkx68,3600640,3607119,it's the other way around  no  we put in our minds what we should do
QyMVTpzkx68,3607119,3613359,but we believe our mind is telling us  it's given us all this feedback  we have to reprogram it and tell us no
QyMVTpzkx68,3613359,3619440,no no we're good  we're good we go it's this sucks  but it's okay
QyMVTpzkx68,3619440,3624480,a lot of us  don't know of a whole nother world that  exists
QyMVTpzkx68,3624480,3631440,it's on the other side of suffering  once you  break these barriers that you have made
QyMVTpzkx68,3631440,3636559,for yourself  like the mind is the most powerful thing  in the world it is so amazing that i
QyMVTpzkx68,3636559,3642319,used to be a 300 pound guy and i thought  that was it  could barely read could do anything and
QyMVTpzkx68,3642319,3647520,now  that what was inside that person  was this guy that's in front of you
QyMVTpzkx68,3647520,3653280,today that's how scary the mind is  and that's what i started realizing  through this journey
QyMVTpzkx68,3653280,3659040,is that  once i got a taste of wow man i haven't  even cracked
QyMVTpzkx68,3659040,3664720,i haven't even begun to crack what the  mind is capable of  and when i start realizing is on the
QyMVTpzkx68,3664720,3672240,other end of suffering  that's the real growth of life because  you realize how the mind processes [ __ ]
QyMVTpzkx68,3672240,3677520,and i talk about another thing called  theory and practice a lot of people are  theorists  they
QyMVTpzkx68,3677520,3685119,these smart guys that read these [ __ ]  books and [ __ ] man and they sit down  they tell you what the mind is supposed  to do and a lot of us listen to that
QyMVTpzkx68,3685119,3692880,[ __ ] it becomes like this is it man this  this old man  who has been studying the mind forever
QyMVTpzkx68,3692880,3698480,this is the cap that we have  by being a practitioner i went out and
QyMVTpzkx68,3698480,3704319,realized  a lot of these guys are so wrong man  the mind has capabilities that are so
QyMVTpzkx68,3704319,3710799,unknown i found that through suffering  and there's a whole other world on the  other end of that
QyMVTpzkx68,3710799,3718000,i was so afraid of myself  that i had to figure out i became a  master of my mind
QyMVTpzkx68,3718000,3724799,people when you're afraid of something  you have to master it that's how you  start to overcome it so what i realized
QyMVTpzkx68,3724799,3730079,when i get to that point where i want to  quit everybody they get the point where  they want to quit this is what happens
QyMVTpzkx68,3730079,3735280,the mind tells you  let's go home  let's take a warm shower let's get some
QyMVTpzkx68,3735280,3741280,food this is not right this is that  if you cannot answer the questions at
QyMVTpzkx68,3741280,3746480,that moment because your mind's gonna  start giving you all these questions  all these questions
QyMVTpzkx68,3746480,3753359,and if you can't answer them  you're going to quit what i realized  when i was going through buds ranger
QyMVTpzkx68,3753359,3759200,school officer 100 mile race 200 mile  races pull up records  my mind would come creeping in like when
QyMVTpzkx68,3759200,3764400,i was doing 4030 pups at 2 000 pull-ups  and my hands were ripped open my mind
QyMVTpzkx68,3764400,3770559,said look brother  we've done all these other things you've  proven yourself you're good
QyMVTpzkx68,3770559,3776240,if i didn't have the answer  to respond to my mind and say why i'm  here
QyMVTpzkx68,3776240,3782960,why i'm doing this  you will always lose that fight you have  to have the response to what your mind
QyMVTpzkx68,3782960,3789440,is going to tell you and another thing  about that is  self-talk  a lot of people have like these big four
QyMVTpzkx68,3789440,3796880,on mental toughness all that [ __ ] is  crap  about self-talk  visualization it's true but the thing
QyMVTpzkx68,3796880,3803920,about self-talking all these things  they ask me what do you think about when  you're on mile 100 of a 205 mile run
QyMVTpzkx68,3803920,3810559,what are you thinking about when you  realize you've run for 24 hours  and you have 24 more hours to run and
QyMVTpzkx68,3810559,3816880,yeah another 105 miles what goes through  your mind  what do you say to yourself i want to  know
QyMVTpzkx68,3816880,3823280,a lot of people think self-talk works it  does but it doesn't work  without the suffering
QyMVTpzkx68,3823280,3828720,before your mind starts saying we need  self-talk so what i tell myself
QyMVTpzkx68,3828720,3834799,is  i go back to the months and years of  preparation to get to that day
QyMVTpzkx68,3834799,3840000,and i'm telling myself  the 3 30 in the morning  and i'm looking at my shoes and i want
QyMVTpzkx68,3840000,3846559,to go out there and run 30 miles  i have to in that second in that moment  of this self-talk my mind said you got
QyMVTpzkx68,3846559,3852240,to find more you got to find more i once  again calm down go back into my mind in
QyMVTpzkx68,3852240,3858160,my cookie jar i call it and i have to  reflect back  on the [ __ ] i did to get here
QyMVTpzkx68,3858160,3865280,and that becomes my self-talk self-talk  does not work unless it is real  most of us lie to ourselves in this
QyMVTpzkx68,3865280,3870799,self-talk it doesn't work  it has to be real it has to be something  that you've done to make it really work
QyMVTpzkx68,3870799,3878000,if you walk into any kind of  event  whether it be physical or mental if you
QyMVTpzkx68,3878000,3883680,walk in with already putting that block  on your mind if man  this ain't going to happen people go how
QyMVTpzkx68,3883680,3889599,did you want to hurt 35 miles to death  batting how'd you run 100 miles with no  training
QyMVTpzkx68,3889599,3895760,because i went into it not thinking i  can't do this man  i went to it with a strategy i had an
QyMVTpzkx68,3895760,3900880,open-mindedness  so until your mind is open to the  possibilities
