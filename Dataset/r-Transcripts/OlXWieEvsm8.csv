OlXWieEvsm8,32558,34800,not a guy who assimilates he's a guy who
OlXWieEvsm8,34800,37360,says this is who i am like it or love it
OlXWieEvsm8,37360,39680,he's very unapologetic about the way he
OlXWieEvsm8,39680,40480,is
OlXWieEvsm8,40480,42800,who he is because he he's never had to
OlXWieEvsm8,42800,44320,be
OlXWieEvsm8,44320,46399,he's always been the alpha
OlXWieEvsm8,46399,47360,and
OlXWieEvsm8,47360,49840,soldier boy wants revenge
OlXWieEvsm8,49840,52960,on why he got taken out of the game
OlXWieEvsm8,52960,54480,why he was
OlXWieEvsm8,54480,56480,left out to pasture
OlXWieEvsm8,56480,58480,and nobody came and got him and brought
OlXWieEvsm8,58480,62160,him back um he's been essentially in
OlXWieEvsm8,62160,63359,uh
OlXWieEvsm8,63359,67200,captivity and being held by the russians
OlXWieEvsm8,67200,68799,for
OlXWieEvsm8,68799,70560,30 some odd years
OlXWieEvsm8,70560,73360,and uh and he's a little he's a little
OlXWieEvsm8,73360,76240,pissed off that his team payback
OlXWieEvsm8,76240,77280,a
OlXWieEvsm8,77280,79040,didn't come and get him
OlXWieEvsm8,79040,81280,but more importantly b gave him up in
OlXWieEvsm8,81280,84430,the first place
OlXWieEvsm8,84430,87619,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,91280,93439,one of my favorite parts of uh this
OlXWieEvsm8,93439,96400,season is uh kimiko's musical sequence
OlXWieEvsm8,96400,97439,and
OlXWieEvsm8,97439,100960,um i mean when i first read the script i
OlXWieEvsm8,100960,104720,was so shocked i knew that eric had
OlXWieEvsm8,104720,106960,been cooking up something special for
OlXWieEvsm8,106960,107759,her
OlXWieEvsm8,107759,109920,but i wasn't sure what the scope of it
OlXWieEvsm8,109920,110799,was
OlXWieEvsm8,110799,113520,and i hear i think eric really likes
OlXWieEvsm8,113520,115520,musicals and he's always wanted to put a
OlXWieEvsm8,115520,118159,musical sequence in a work of his
OlXWieEvsm8,118159,119200,and
OlXWieEvsm8,119200,122159,i'm honored to be um the character to be
OlXWieEvsm8,122159,123520,playing the character that gets to do
OlXWieEvsm8,123520,125119,that i mean you wouldn't know it from
OlXWieEvsm8,125119,126880,the stuff that i make but i'm just like
OlXWieEvsm8,126880,128640,the biggest fan of like classic
OlXWieEvsm8,128640,130879,hollywood musicals i just love them if i
OlXWieEvsm8,130879,132400,remember correctly
OlXWieEvsm8,132400,136160,while we were breaking season two
OlXWieEvsm8,136160,137840,um
OlXWieEvsm8,137840,140400,there was for a minute in one of the
OlXWieEvsm8,140400,143120,episodes like a big musical number with
OlXWieEvsm8,143120,145440,frenchie and kamiko that and never do
OlXWieEvsm8,145440,147680,this as a showrunner i told karen about
OlXWieEvsm8,147680,148640,it
OlXWieEvsm8,148640,151040,which never do and so karen was like oh
OlXWieEvsm8,151040,152560,my god that's incredible it's honestly
OlXWieEvsm8,152560,154560,always been my dream and then it like
OlXWieEvsm8,154560,157920,fell out of the story as it often does
OlXWieEvsm8,157920,159040,um
OlXWieEvsm8,159040,160959,and so i had to go back then so it's
OlXWieEvsm8,160959,162959,just like such a rookie showrunner move
OlXWieEvsm8,162959,164560,and then i had to go back then and say
OlXWieEvsm8,164560,166800,oh it turns out that it fell out but
OlXWieEvsm8,166800,168640,we're gonna look for that moment i
OlXWieEvsm8,168640,170720,really want that moment so
OlXWieEvsm8,170720,172720,from that point forward it wasn't just i
OlXWieEvsm8,172720,174239,want to get a musical number in the show
OlXWieEvsm8,174239,175840,it was always in my head that it's like
OlXWieEvsm8,175840,177519,frenchie and kamiko who should have that
OlXWieEvsm8,177519,179680,musical number you know we needed a
OlXWieEvsm8,179680,183280,reason to really dramatize
OlXWieEvsm8,183280,185040,kamiko's joy
OlXWieEvsm8,185040,186000,at
OlXWieEvsm8,186000,188400,finally being powerless or what she
OlXWieEvsm8,188400,191040,considers quote-unquote normal
OlXWieEvsm8,191040,193680,and her just absolute elation at it and
OlXWieEvsm8,193680,195120,so at that point it was sort of like the
OlXWieEvsm8,195120,197519,perfect place that that
OlXWieEvsm8,197519,199519,she would express herself in this like
OlXWieEvsm8,199519,200640,huge
OlXWieEvsm8,200640,203200,hollywood
OlXWieEvsm8,209610,211519,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,211519,213519,i number starlight
OlXWieEvsm8,213519,217560,i got sweet dreams
OlXWieEvsm8,221000,224270,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,227680,229120,i can't believe i got to sing on this
OlXWieEvsm8,229120,232480,show i mean in general i can't believe i
OlXWieEvsm8,232480,234159,got to sing
OlXWieEvsm8,234159,237439,on a tv show ever but uh especially this
OlXWieEvsm8,237439,241040,one because kimiko doesn't speak
OlXWieEvsm8,241040,242799,i remember i had this really surreal
OlXWieEvsm8,242799,244239,moment on set
OlXWieEvsm8,244239,246480,that day
OlXWieEvsm8,246480,248799,everything was colorful it was magical
OlXWieEvsm8,248799,250720,it was beautiful
OlXWieEvsm8,250720,251760,the first
OlXWieEvsm8,251760,254560,day may be on the boys where i'm not
OlXWieEvsm8,254560,256320,covered in blood
OlXWieEvsm8,256320,260000,uh not covered in tears and
OlXWieEvsm8,260000,261519,it was just everything was so happy and
OlXWieEvsm8,261519,263520,then i looked around and i i saw the
OlXWieEvsm8,263520,265759,crew and everything came together
OlXWieEvsm8,265759,267520,beautifully and
OlXWieEvsm8,267520,270240,i got to somehow be a center be the
OlXWieEvsm8,270240,272320,center of that and
OlXWieEvsm8,272320,273680,i guess a little bit has to do with
OlXWieEvsm8,273680,275680,being asian-american a little bit has to
OlXWieEvsm8,275680,277840,do with not having confidence in myself
OlXWieEvsm8,277840,279840,in the past but i never thought that i
OlXWieEvsm8,279840,281600,would be
OlXWieEvsm8,281600,283440,ever the lead of a musical even though
OlXWieEvsm8,283440,286000,that had been my dream as a kid i never
OlXWieEvsm8,286000,287440,thought that that
OlXWieEvsm8,287440,289360,would happen that dream would come true
OlXWieEvsm8,289360,291199,and then i had that moment on set where
OlXWieEvsm8,291199,292800,i looked around and i looked at tomorrow
OlXWieEvsm8,292800,294960,and i said this is crazy
OlXWieEvsm8,294960,297680,you know it for it's only you know two
OlXWieEvsm8,297680,300160,minutes on the show but uh we got to
OlXWieEvsm8,300160,302240,film for two to three days and i got to
OlXWieEvsm8,302240,303919,live my dream so
OlXWieEvsm8,303919,306639,um yeah it was it was a dream come true
OlXWieEvsm8,306639,308320,in terms of filming the musical number
OlXWieEvsm8,308320,309280,it took
OlXWieEvsm8,309280,312880,weeks of choreography i mean they worked
OlXWieEvsm8,312880,314240,there
OlXWieEvsm8,314240,315759,like all the different elements of it
OlXWieEvsm8,315759,317039,coming together
OlXWieEvsm8,317039,318080,um
OlXWieEvsm8,318080,320000,were so fun and such a pleasure to work
OlXWieEvsm8,320000,322400,on and it was just really fun
OlXWieEvsm8,322400,324960,to get dailies that were not
OlXWieEvsm8,324960,327120,like completely cynical and dark and
OlXWieEvsm8,327120,329039,bloody you know it was just nice to have
OlXWieEvsm8,329039,330880,just something pure i would do a whole
OlXWieEvsm8,330880,332400,musical episode if i could if i could
OlXWieEvsm8,332400,334639,justify it i would do it but it's hard
OlXWieEvsm8,334639,336560,in our universe to like totally justify
OlXWieEvsm8,336560,339560,it
OlXWieEvsm8,339760,342880,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,350400,354720,i think i need coffee you won't go there
OlXWieEvsm8,355440,357280,i'll be right back i don't want to put a
OlXWieEvsm8,357280,359280,label on frenchie and kimiko's
OlXWieEvsm8,359280,361600,relationship because i don't think we've
OlXWieEvsm8,361600,364840,seen a relationship like theirs
OlXWieEvsm8,364840,367840,before and it's fresh and we don't know
OlXWieEvsm8,367840,369280,where it's going it's kind of a
OlXWieEvsm8,369280,370880,combination of everything it's a little
OlXWieEvsm8,370880,373840,bit romantic i think
OlXWieEvsm8,373840,375840,it's definitely friendship it's a little
OlXWieEvsm8,375840,379199,bit of familial love as well and
OlXWieEvsm8,379199,381039,what's beautiful about them is that they
OlXWieEvsm8,381039,384080,always support one another and one of my
OlXWieEvsm8,384080,385360,favorite lines
OlXWieEvsm8,385360,388960,this season um i'm paraphrasing but
OlXWieEvsm8,388960,390560,she said it's
OlXWieEvsm8,390560,391520,you know
OlXWieEvsm8,391520,394000,he's picked her up in her darkest times
OlXWieEvsm8,394000,395600,and there's a moment when she's trying
OlXWieEvsm8,395600,398080,to pick him up when he's uh
OlXWieEvsm8,398080,400000,he's kind of giving up and
OlXWieEvsm8,400000,401039,she says
OlXWieEvsm8,401039,403680,you saw something in me and
OlXWieEvsm8,403680,405680,now i see it in you
OlXWieEvsm8,405680,409120,monker my heart and so it's kind of like
OlXWieEvsm8,409120,410160,seeing
OlXWieEvsm8,410160,412479,herself in him and i think in other
OlXWieEvsm8,412479,416080,moments he sees himself and her and
OlXWieEvsm8,416080,419120,that's how this bond is
OlXWieEvsm8,419120,421520,connected and so strong
OlXWieEvsm8,421520,422400,so
OlXWieEvsm8,422400,426560,seth has uh uh yeah a very revealing
OlXWieEvsm8,426560,428319,take away my writer's good card
OlXWieEvsm8,428319,432160,revealing cameo in uh episode five and
OlXWieEvsm8,432160,433360,you know that's
OlXWieEvsm8,433360,436400,uh i would call that just being like
OlXWieEvsm8,436400,438880,a good supportive executive producer and
OlXWieEvsm8,438880,442160,taking one for the team um we had a long
OlXWieEvsm8,442160,445039,list of like name cameos that we wanted
OlXWieEvsm8,445039,449520,to we wanted to go after to put in that
OlXWieEvsm8,449520,452240,um and for some reason they all passed i
OlXWieEvsm8,452240,454080,have no idea why they wouldn't want to
OlXWieEvsm8,454080,455280,jerk off
OlXWieEvsm8,455280,457520,to crimson counties
OlXWieEvsm8,457520,459919,aggressively on camera and then orgasm
OlXWieEvsm8,459919,462479,too early i i just can't imagine why an
OlXWieEvsm8,462479,464960,actor wouldn't want to do that dream
OlXWieEvsm8,464960,465919,role
OlXWieEvsm8,465919,467680,so people obviously just kept passing
OlXWieEvsm8,467680,469759,over and over and over again and every
OlXWieEvsm8,469759,472319,time we moved further down the list i
OlXWieEvsm8,472319,475199,kept i started to say like hey seth

OlXWieEvsm8,479680,481199,and
OlXWieEvsm8,481199,483680,he said uh hilariously and by the way i
OlXWieEvsm8,483680,486319,love this about seth's career he's like
OlXWieEvsm8,486319,487680,he's like

OlXWieEvsm8,501280,503919,every resource and we keep going down

OlXWieEvsm8,558560,561200,it's not dirty and there's not shame
OlXWieEvsm8,561200,563360,he's just kind of like excited to be

OlXWieEvsm8,572640,575200,you know guilt-free about being there i
OlXWieEvsm8,575200,576399,actually thought that was actually
OlXWieEvsm8,576399,577760,really nice i actually thought it was a
OlXWieEvsm8,577760,580000,weirdly positive message what the hell
OlXWieEvsm8,580000,582560,is going on
OlXWieEvsm8,585279,588640,amy what are you doing here mm called me
OlXWieEvsm8,588640,590800,did he i just told her you might need
OlXWieEvsm8,590800,593440,some backup
OlXWieEvsm8,593600,596160,that's all
OlXWieEvsm8,596320,598080,but you shouldn't be here all right it's
OlXWieEvsm8,598080,600399,dangerous it's too dangerous for me what
OlXWieEvsm8,600399,603200,about you oy you lot
OlXWieEvsm8,603200,604959,take a little tiff somewhere else we're
OlXWieEvsm8,604959,606640,on the job here
OlXWieEvsm8,606640,608640,i think i think she feels really
OlXWieEvsm8,608640,610959,betrayed by huey i also think she feels
OlXWieEvsm8,610959,613279,really betrayed by butcher and i think
OlXWieEvsm8,613279,615120,that you know
OlXWieEvsm8,615120,617040,while huey and annie have both been the
OlXWieEvsm8,617040,619360,moral compasses of this show
OlXWieEvsm8,619360,619910,um
OlXWieEvsm8,619910,621120,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,621120,624560,i think that huey's line is further than
OlXWieEvsm8,624560,626720,annie's in terms of what she's willing
OlXWieEvsm8,626720,628399,to cross and
OlXWieEvsm8,628399,630399,i think that drugging
OlXWieEvsm8,630399,632000,mother's milk which we see in that
OlXWieEvsm8,632000,634399,moment and i'm sure you know huey
OlXWieEvsm8,634399,636000,is aware of
OlXWieEvsm8,636000,637519,um
OlXWieEvsm8,637519,641120,i think the length with at which
OlXWieEvsm8,641120,642160,butcher
OlXWieEvsm8,642160,643839,and huey
OlXWieEvsm8,643839,647200,go are just links that starlight or
OlXWieEvsm8,647200,649519,annie is not willing to go to because
OlXWieEvsm8,649519,651920,she's not willing to drug mother's milk
OlXWieEvsm8,651920,653040,to
OlXWieEvsm8,653040,655519,get something done i think she feels
OlXWieEvsm8,655519,657760,really betrayed on behalf of him and i
OlXWieEvsm8,657760,661519,feel like she feels she thinks that huey
OlXWieEvsm8,661519,662959,is starting to
OlXWieEvsm8,662959,666160,fight the fight from the wrong angle
OlXWieEvsm8,666160,668240,and i think that
OlXWieEvsm8,668240,672399,um it's a foreshadow
OlXWieEvsm8,672640,674959,for the rest of the season
OlXWieEvsm8,674959,676399,and
OlXWieEvsm8,676399,680160,annie feeling like huey is willing to
OlXWieEvsm8,680160,682560,sacrifice other people
OlXWieEvsm8,682560,686000,to kill homeland or to get to
OlXWieEvsm8,686000,688880,anyone um and accomplish their goals
OlXWieEvsm8,688880,691440,whereas starlight is not willing to have
OlXWieEvsm8,691440,694160,innocent casualties so i think she's
OlXWieEvsm8,694160,696959,starting to really detect and see
OlXWieEvsm8,696959,700000,a side of huey that
OlXWieEvsm8,700000,700839,that
OlXWieEvsm8,700839,702800,feels
OlXWieEvsm8,702800,706160,like his intention is right but i feel
OlXWieEvsm8,706160,708160,like he's going about it in the wrong
OlXWieEvsm8,708160,710160,way and i think it really scares her and
OlXWieEvsm8,710160,712079,i think she feels a betrayal you want to
OlXWieEvsm8,712079,714800,counter says hit on a spunk don't you
OlXWieEvsm8,714800,716639,well she's in there
OlXWieEvsm8,716639,719200,yours for the time
OlXWieEvsm8,719200,722480,consider it a gesture of good faith
OlXWieEvsm8,722480,725440,good faith for what
OlXWieEvsm8,729279,732399,i was thinking that you and i
OlXWieEvsm8,732399,735120,have come to a little arrangement
OlXWieEvsm8,735120,737760,what you look cool
OlXWieEvsm8,737760,740240,a team up he has a bit of a vendetta
OlXWieEvsm8,740240,742079,when he arrives on the scene
OlXWieEvsm8,742079,744800,and um butcher of course uses that to
OlXWieEvsm8,744800,746320,his advantage
OlXWieEvsm8,746320,747440,uh to
OlXWieEvsm8,747440,749920,to team up and create an alliance
OlXWieEvsm8,749920,752880,um butcher obviously has his agenda
OlXWieEvsm8,752880,755200,but he he tries to
OlXWieEvsm8,755200,758000,align those stars so that soldier boy
OlXWieEvsm8,758000,760079,gets what he wants and butcher gets what
OlXWieEvsm8,760079,762800,he wants uh lori was great she's she
OlXWieEvsm8,762800,765360,brings a lot of great energy into a
OlXWieEvsm8,765360,769360,scene she's got she's got lots of ideas
OlXWieEvsm8,769360,770880,but that was
OlXWieEvsm8,770880,774160,that was our first scene together
OlXWieEvsm8,774399,777680,because i still loved you
OlXWieEvsm8,779200,782240,i didn't love you
OlXWieEvsm8,782320,785360,i hated you
OlXWieEvsm8,785600,789240,we all did
OlXWieEvsm8,793970,800959,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,801200,804160,it was you know it was a a
OlXWieEvsm8,804160,808240,confrontation with an ex-lover um
OlXWieEvsm8,808240,809839,and
OlXWieEvsm8,809839,812480,we see in in the in the filming of it
OlXWieEvsm8,812480,814560,soulja boy actually gets pretty upset in
OlXWieEvsm8,814560,816959,the in the scene um
OlXWieEvsm8,816959,819279,i i understand that i think some of that
OlXWieEvsm8,819279,821920,emotion was was cut out uh because it
OlXWieEvsm8,821920,823920,didn't it didn't it didn't feel right it
OlXWieEvsm8,823920,826880,didn't service the story as i think as
OlXWieEvsm8,826880,830000,well as just being calm and and cool and
OlXWieEvsm8,830000,830959,a
OlXWieEvsm8,830959,833600,kind of a stone cold killer
OlXWieEvsm8,833600,834800,but
OlXWieEvsm8,834800,837760,but he is uh he's very angry at the fact
OlXWieEvsm8,837760,838800,that his
OlXWieEvsm8,838800,841760,the person that he trusted and loved and
OlXWieEvsm8,841760,843360,relied on
OlXWieEvsm8,843360,845680,not only gave him up
OlXWieEvsm8,845680,847360,but never came for him
OlXWieEvsm8,847360,848720,and uh
OlXWieEvsm8,848720,851360,and then reveals that she's like
OlXWieEvsm8,851360,854000,i never i never loved you and so that's
OlXWieEvsm8,854000,856000,uh that's certainly a jagged pill that
OlXWieEvsm8,856000,859199,he's that he is now forced to swallow
OlXWieEvsm8,859199,861279,but it also
OlXWieEvsm8,861279,864320,it also kind of sets in motion
OlXWieEvsm8,864320,865839,this
OlXWieEvsm8,865839,869120,or or reinvigorates his uh
OlXWieEvsm8,869120,872720,his idea of of revenge and vendetta
OlXWieEvsm8,872720,875410,against his his team
OlXWieEvsm8,875410,882800,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,882800,885839,what are you doing
OlXWieEvsm8,887839,889920,annie listen
OlXWieEvsm8,889920,891519,we wanted a weapon
OlXWieEvsm8,891519,893279,soldier boy's our weapon
OlXWieEvsm8,893279,895279,he's how we kill homelander and newman
OlXWieEvsm8,895279,896560,maybe
OlXWieEvsm8,896560,899040,if anyone's strong enough he is
OlXWieEvsm8,899040,901680,you knew butcher was going to do this
OlXWieEvsm8,901680,904720,men never would have gone for it and you
OlXWieEvsm8,904720,907519,look you weren't supposed to be here oh
OlXWieEvsm8,907519,909760,so
OlXWieEvsm8,909760,913720,no more secrets huh
OlXWieEvsm8,913760,915760,huey
OlXWieEvsm8,915760,917839,you're teaming up with a murderer this
OlXWieEvsm8,917839,919839,is the only way that i can save you from
OlXWieEvsm8,919839,922480,homelander
OlXWieEvsm8,924079,927279,i'm doing this for you whatever it takes
OlXWieEvsm8,927279,928959,remember
OlXWieEvsm8,928959,931519,i think the really important thing about
OlXWieEvsm8,931519,933920,addressing toxic masculinity in this
OlXWieEvsm8,933920,936480,season is that we also address it with a
OlXWieEvsm8,936480,938399,character that you never expect to see
OlXWieEvsm8,938399,940639,it from
OlXWieEvsm8,940639,941839,and
OlXWieEvsm8,941839,944079,in fact you know when they first start
OlXWieEvsm8,944079,946079,dating
OlXWieEvsm8,946079,946959,he
OlXWieEvsm8,946959,950639,empowers her and he says that her powers
OlXWieEvsm8,950639,953040,don't make him feel emasculated he
OlXWieEvsm8,953040,954800,literally says that and i think that's
OlXWieEvsm8,954800,956160,partially what
OlXWieEvsm8,956160,959360,makes her fall deeper in love with him
OlXWieEvsm8,959360,962320,and so i think that it reflects the fact
OlXWieEvsm8,962320,964880,that people can be paradoxical and
OlXWieEvsm8,964880,966800,contradict themselves and be really
OlXWieEvsm8,966800,968399,complicated and
OlXWieEvsm8,968399,969199,and
OlXWieEvsm8,969199,972720,and i think huey becomes very triggered
OlXWieEvsm8,972720,975279,by the fact that he is continuously
OlXWieEvsm8,975279,978800,saved by annie and not vice versa and
OlXWieEvsm8,978800,980720,he's triggered in a way that he didn't
OlXWieEvsm8,980720,983279,expect i think it breaks
OlXWieEvsm8,983279,986240,starlight's heart because as i said this
OlXWieEvsm8,986240,988000,is one of the reasons why she fell in
OlXWieEvsm8,988000,989920,love with him that he wasn't threatened
OlXWieEvsm8,989920,991120,by her that
OlXWieEvsm8,991120,994240,that she felt empowered by him and that
OlXWieEvsm8,994240,997360,she could be herself around him
OlXWieEvsm8,997360,998399,um
OlXWieEvsm8,998399,1000320,and i think the most important thing is
OlXWieEvsm8,1000320,1001440,that
OlXWieEvsm8,1001440,1003279,you know
OlXWieEvsm8,1003279,1004759,someone who is
OlXWieEvsm8,1004759,1008480,unambiguously good and that is huey
OlXWieEvsm8,1008480,1009360,can
OlXWieEvsm8,1009360,1012480,experience toxic masculinity
OlXWieEvsm8,1012480,1015040,and it doesn't make him a bad person as
OlXWieEvsm8,1015040,1016320,long as he
OlXWieEvsm8,1016320,1019360,is able to eventually self-assess step
OlXWieEvsm8,1019360,1021199,out of it and learn from it which he
OlXWieEvsm8,1021199,1022240,does
OlXWieEvsm8,1022240,1025038,but the toxic masculinity thing i just
OlXWieEvsm8,1025038,1027038,think was
OlXWieEvsm8,1027038,1029120,even more important to address in a
OlXWieEvsm8,1029120,1030640,character like huey because you would
OlXWieEvsm8,1030640,1032959,expect it from other characters but not
OlXWieEvsm8,1032959,1034400,from him
OlXWieEvsm8,1034400,1036400,um but it was also an interesting
OlXWieEvsm8,1036400,1038640,dynamic for us to
OlXWieEvsm8,1038640,1040079,explore
OlXWieEvsm8,1040079,1042319,together that you've never seen before
OlXWieEvsm8,1042319,1044720,that's completely unprecedented and that
OlXWieEvsm8,1044720,1046640,i don't think the audience will expect
OlXWieEvsm8,1046640,1048640,but i think it just reflects
OlXWieEvsm8,1048640,1051120,the messiness and the paradoxical and
OlXWieEvsm8,1051120,1052400,contradictory
OlXWieEvsm8,1052400,1056600,nature of being a human being
OlXWieEvsm8,1058530,1069029,[Music]
OlXWieEvsm8,1070480,1072559,you
