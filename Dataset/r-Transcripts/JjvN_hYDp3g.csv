JjvN_hYDp3g,2160,6240,What gets you out of bed? What gets you off the couch?  
JjvN_hYDp3g,7680,11840,What gets you in the gym? It's not your alarm.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,13520,17360,It's not your parents. It's not your friends.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,19040,23360,It's you. The only one that can make it happen for you  
JjvN_hYDp3g,23360,26560,is you. It's really hard to be lead  
JjvN_hYDp3g,26560,29439,by your but. But I'm not qualified.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,29440,32320,But I'm not good enough. But I'm not smart enough.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,32320,35360,But I didn't go to the right school. But I don't have enough money.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,35360,40160,"But, but, but, but, but. If you're ever going to step into your future,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,40160,44080,"if you're ever going to step into your destiny, you're going to have to get over your but.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,44880,47680,"And that's what a pity party is, when you have an undisciplined mind  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,47680,51680,and you mediate on the wrong thing over and over and over again.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,51680,54560,"If you're gonna throw a pity party, I give you 3 days and that's it.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,54560,56560,"And after 3 days, you cut off your record player,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,56560,59120,"your iPod, your MP3, and you come up with a plan.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,60240,63040,"Do I just sit there and settle? No, I don't.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,63040,65519,"I say enough is enough, man, and I'm gonna make a change,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,65519,70640,and I'm gonna keep going until I get it. You chase something that you believe you deserve  
JjvN_hYDp3g,70640,73200,"until you get it. And it doesn't matter what happens to you,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,73200,75920,"doesn't matter how many times you've been fired, doesn't matter how many people  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,75920,78880,"don't believe in you, you just go until you get it.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,78880,81439,That's the point. Are you tired yet?  
JjvN_hYDp3g,81440,84720,Some of you need to get tired. You need to be tired of what's  
JjvN_hYDp3g,84720,87040,"going on in your life. Get tired of your habits,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,87040,89680,get tired of the actions that  you're putting in every day.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,89680,91840,"You gotta change, man, or nothing changes.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,91840,95280,I woke up one day and stopped making excuses.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,95280,98159,I woke up one day and stopped  playing the blame game.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,98160,101360,"I woke up one day and looked at the  man in the mirror and was like,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,101360,104640,"yo bruh, what are you doing? Wake up, it's showtime.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,104640,107600,Let's go. Get up.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,107600,109840,"Go to class, get up. Do your homework.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,109840,112479,"You wake up earlier than people, you stay later than people,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,112480,115920,"you stay humble, you work harder than anyone when no one's there.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,116560,119520,"I guarantee, someone that feels  bad about themselves soon  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,119520,123759,"will label you as ""He's built different."" ""He's built different"" should be your label  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,123760,128080,because people feel bad about themselves. Your life is exactly what you wanted.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,128080,130800,Because every day you've had choices to make.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,130800,133120,You're responsible and credible  for every single choice.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,133120,136400,"You've made the choices. And what I need you to do for me is,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,136400,139760,why are you here? And then take ownership of why you're here.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,139760,143280,So you control you. This world ain't gonna give you what you deserve.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,143280,147200,This world gonna give you what you work for. I put that work in every single day.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,147200,149760,"And when you wake up every single  day, and you put that work in,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,149760,152560,"and yes, for some of us, it  might be harder than others,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,152560,154880,"man, whatever, we do whatever it is we gotta do.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,154880,157840,"Especially when we're desperate. Winning's not loyal to you,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,157840,161519,it doesn't care about you. Winning doesn't care how sore you are.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,161520,165520,Winning doesn't care how much sleep you get. Winning doesn't care how hard you work at times.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,165520,170240,"Winning requires all of you and then more, and it promises you nothing.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,170240,173120,It's a mastermind of creating  fear and doubt in your mind.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,173120,176799,"It causes setback after setback. So the question isn't about winning,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,176800,179360,are you willing to sprint  when the distance is unknown?  
JjvN_hYDp3g,179360,183360,And why chase this thing called winning? Because the only thing that's guaranteed in life  
JjvN_hYDp3g,183360,185120,"if you don't chase it, is losing.  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,185120,188560,Now is the time to grind. Now is the time to show the world  
JjvN_hYDp3g,188560,191599,that I was placed here for a purpose. Work for it.  
JjvN_hYDp3g,191600,194320,"Fight for it. It begins today,  "
JjvN_hYDp3g,194320,197840,"it continues tomorrow, and it never f*cking dies."
