UzmvtVAuuyI,200,4879,"Montessori Education is based on the principles developed by Maria Montessori,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,4880,11460,who opened her first school for children of low-income workers in an apartment building in Rome in 1907.
UzmvtVAuuyI,11460,15800,"The school was called  “Casa dei Bambini”, Home for Children."
UzmvtVAuuyI,17020,20440,"This first “Casa” was furnished with a teachers table,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,20440,24820,"a stove, a blackboard, some chairs, group tables for the children"
UzmvtVAuuyI,24820,29320,and a cabinet filled with materials that Montessori developed in her earlier career
UzmvtVAuuyI,29320,34780,when she researched how to teach kids who experience some form of mental disability.
UzmvtVAuuyI,34780,38640,Maria Montessori created the materials  after she realised
UzmvtVAuuyI,38640,45200,that students seem to understand complex concepts better when they engaged all their senses.
UzmvtVAuuyI,46500,51940,"Activities at this first school included personal care (such as dressing and undressing),"
UzmvtVAuuyI,51940,55500,"care of the environment like sweeping, dusting and gardening."
UzmvtVAuuyI,55500,58980,Otherwise they were free to move around  and play with the materials.
UzmvtVAuuyI,58980,61400,Montessori did not teach herself
UzmvtVAuuyI,61400,65400,but instead oversaw the classroom work of her teachers.
UzmvtVAuuyI,66700,71299,Montessori observed that children showed episodes of deep concentration
UzmvtVAuuyI,71300,74140,and multiple repetitions of the same activity.
UzmvtVAuuyI,74320,75700,"Given free choice,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,75700,79420,kids showed more interest in practical activities  and the materials
UzmvtVAuuyI,79420,82400,"than normal toys, sweets or other rewards."
UzmvtVAuuyI,82400,86160,Over time spontaneous self-discipline emerged.
UzmvtVAuuyI,87520,90820,Montessori concluded that working independently
UzmvtVAuuyI,90820,95680,children seemed to reach new levels of autonomy and become self-motivated learners.
UzmvtVAuuyI,95680,99820,She began to see the role of the teacher as a facilitator of young human beings
UzmvtVAuuyI,99820,104280,who are free to move and act within the limits of a prepared environment.
UzmvtVAuuyI,104800,112000,The goal: to grow children to become independent and responsible adults who share a love for learning.
UzmvtVAuuyI,113200,118000,Soon after Montessori herself and her ideas started travelling the world
UzmvtVAuuyI,118000,121900,to inspired progressive thinkers and educators from all over.
UzmvtVAuuyI,121900,126980,"The inventors, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, became early advocates."
UzmvtVAuuyI,126980,130280,"Later alumni include Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,130280,132620,author Gabriel Garcia Marquez
UzmvtVAuuyI,132620,137280,as well as the two Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
UzmvtVAuuyI,138460,143420,"Today the term “Montessori” stands more for a method, than a school itself."
UzmvtVAuuyI,143580,148940,The fact that it can be used freely by anyone led to a great variation of schools.
UzmvtVAuuyI,149060,152819,"Educators all over the world borrow Montessori's name,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,152820,156320,"insights and materials to organize kindergartens,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,156320,159040,"elementary schools, special needs programs,"
UzmvtVAuuyI,159040,161579,or even full 12 year curriculums.
UzmvtVAuuyI,161580,164320,Some parents use it for homeschooling.
UzmvtVAuuyI,165520,169100,The following characteristics are shared  among most programs:
UzmvtVAuuyI,169440,171840,- Students are free to choose what to learn
UzmvtVAuuyI,172120,174980,- Open classrooms that allow free movement
UzmvtVAuuyI,175260,178459,- Use of specialised Montessori materials
UzmvtVAuuyI,178660,183720,"- Mixed age classes (from 0-3, 3-6 or 6-12)"
UzmvtVAuuyI,183720,186060,so children can learn from each other
UzmvtVAuuyI,186360,190220,"- Uninterrupted blocks of study time, usually three hours"
UzmvtVAuuyI,190480,192159,- No grading or homework
UzmvtVAuuyI,192300,194380,- and a trained teacher
UzmvtVAuuyI,195780,198920,Maria Montessori once famously said:
UzmvtVAuuyI,198920,203540,“Never help a child with a task  at which he feels he can succeed.”
