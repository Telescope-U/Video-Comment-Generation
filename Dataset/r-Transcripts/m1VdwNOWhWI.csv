m1VdwNOWhWI,230,1630,- Hot and ready!
m1VdwNOWhWI,1630,3429,Or where a kid can be a kid.
m1VdwNOWhWI,3430,5035,- Let's talk about that.
m1VdwNOWhWI,5035,8202,(gentle upbeat music)
m1VdwNOWhWI,12820,13860,Good Mythical Morning.
m1VdwNOWhWI,13860,16470,- Today we are doing a food feud
m1VdwNOWhWI,16470,18220,that's pretty unexpected.
m1VdwNOWhWI,18220,19930,"When I say Little Caesar's,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,19930,22210,who do you think of as their nemesis?
m1VdwNOWhWI,22210,23869,- Chuck E. Cheese!
m1VdwNOWhWI,23870,25278,Because I read the video title.
m1VdwNOWhWI,25278,28060,"- Okay, thank you for playing along, Rhett."
m1VdwNOWhWI,28060,31890,"Yes, as it turns out, the animatronic mouse has been gunning"
m1VdwNOWhWI,31890,35079,for Caesar right under our noses this whole time.
m1VdwNOWhWI,35080,38374,Their menus are strikingly similar.
m1VdwNOWhWI,38374,39207,- Eerily.
m1VdwNOWhWI,39207,40040,- It's disturbingly similar.
m1VdwNOWhWI,40040,40873,- Eerily similar.
m1VdwNOWhWI,40873,41706,- It's eerie.
m1VdwNOWhWI,41706,42539,- You weren't thinking it but we were thinking it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,42539,43594,We noticed it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,43594,44427,- It's true.
m1VdwNOWhWI,44427,46269,- The only real difference is their stance on ball pits.
m1VdwNOWhWI,46270,49300,Okay? Their offerings are perfect for a food feud.
m1VdwNOWhWI,49300,52329,It's time for Food Feuds: Little Caesar's
m1VdwNOWhWI,52330,54370,versus Chuck E. Cheese.
m1VdwNOWhWI,54370,56449,- We're gonna taste and compare popular menu items
m1VdwNOWhWI,56450,60030,for both establishments and rate each one head-to-head.
m1VdwNOWhWI,60030,61860,Whichever pizza place garners the most points
m1VdwNOWhWI,61860,64108,will be dubbed the prince a pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,64108,66440,Pizza pizza. Prince a pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,66440,67273,- I get it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,67273,68167,That was a little forced.
m1VdwNOWhWI,68167,70093,- And will win a chance to sponsor a future GMM episode.
m1VdwNOWhWI,70093,72695,- When you have to explain the joke that hard-
m1VdwNOWhWI,72695,74598,- Pizza pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,74598,75431,- There you go.
m1VdwNOWhWI,75431,76264,- It's a pizza pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,76264,77097,"- Yeah, it is."
m1VdwNOWhWI,77097,77930,- Prince a pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,77930,78763,- Let's do it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,78763,80320,(rock music riffing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,80320,82270,"All right, let's see who's serving us food today."
m1VdwNOWhWI,82270,83331,- Hey.
m1VdwNOWhWI,83332,84165,- Hey.
m1VdwNOWhWI,84165,86520,"- Guys, I am Chuck E. Cheese Charlie."
m1VdwNOWhWI,86520,87353,"- Hey, that's convenient."
m1VdwNOWhWI,87353,89210,"- Yeah, soon to be manager Charlie."
m1VdwNOWhWI,89210,91080,as long as today goes well.
m1VdwNOWhWI,91080,92511,"Fingers crossed, though."
m1VdwNOWhWI,92511,93344,- Oh.
m1VdwNOWhWI,93344,94177,"- Yeah, but, Timmy!"
m1VdwNOWhWI,94177,95930,Get out of the ball pit!
m1VdwNOWhWI,95930,96763,- Okay.
m1VdwNOWhWI,96763,98360,- Do not pee in there again!
m1VdwNOWhWI,98360,99193,- Okay.
m1VdwNOWhWI,99193,100228,- So this is-
m1VdwNOWhWI,100228,101430,"- Is that your son, you bring him to work?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,101430,102990,- Just this kid who keeps showing up.
m1VdwNOWhWI,102990,104270,I don't even know where his parents are.
m1VdwNOWhWI,104270,105842,So this is a garlic bread.
m1VdwNOWhWI,105843,106801,- [Rhett] Really?
m1VdwNOWhWI,106801,107634,"- It's got garlic and bread,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,107634,111168,and also mozzarella cheese and cheddar for 7.49.
m1VdwNOWhWI,111168,112001,It's delicious.
m1VdwNOWhWI,112001,112960,- Cheddar on there too.
m1VdwNOWhWI,112960,114460,"That's, let's note that."
m1VdwNOWhWI,114460,115403,- I noted cheddar.
m1VdwNOWhWI,116560,117393,Hi.
m1VdwNOWhWI,117393,118520,- Hi.
m1VdwNOWhWI,118520,119535,- Hi.
m1VdwNOWhWI,119536,121970,- I'm Little Caesar's Lauren.
m1VdwNOWhWI,121970,123480,"I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous."
m1VdwNOWhWI,123480,126660,"Ever since we installed the Little Caesar's pizza lockers,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,126660,130509,I haven't really talk to people in a while.
m1VdwNOWhWI,130509,131510,So I'm a little shy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,132670,134563,- Just think of us as two lockers.
m1VdwNOWhWI,136460,137751,- It makes it worse.
m1VdwNOWhWI,137751,142400,So that is freshly baked bread covered in cheese
m1VdwNOWhWI,142400,144120,and Italian spices for 4.50.
m1VdwNOWhWI,144120,146280,I don't know what to do with my hands.
m1VdwNOWhWI,146280,147170,- Is there any-
m1VdwNOWhWI,147170,148510,- Is this good?
m1VdwNOWhWI,148510,149342,"- Yeah, is that-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,149343,150560,"- Well, take 'em that way."
m1VdwNOWhWI,150560,151392,- I don't know.
m1VdwNOWhWI,151393,153650,"- So one's, there's no cheddar over here."
m1VdwNOWhWI,153650,154909,- [Rhett] This looks impressive.
m1VdwNOWhWI,154910,158190,- When's the last time you've been to the E. Cheese?
m1VdwNOWhWI,158190,159023,Whoa!
m1VdwNOWhWI,159023,161459,"- Dude, not in my adult, I never took my kids there."
m1VdwNOWhWI,161460,162580,Did you take your kids there?
m1VdwNOWhWI,162580,163413,Oh.
m1VdwNOWhWI,163413,164907,- I took 'em to ShowBiz.
m1VdwNOWhWI,164908,165741,Look at that.
m1VdwNOWhWI,165741,166573,- It's pieces.
m1VdwNOWhWI,166574,168150,- It's perforated.
m1VdwNOWhWI,168150,170420,Like the cheese isn't perforated.
m1VdwNOWhWI,170420,171300,- That's pretty tasty.
m1VdwNOWhWI,171300,172190,You taste that cheddar?
m1VdwNOWhWI,172190,173300,Taste that cheddar?
m1VdwNOWhWI,173300,175020,We wanted me to notice it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,175020,176350,"- I mean, it's notable."
m1VdwNOWhWI,176350,177850,- [Stevie] Did you know that Chuck E. Cheese
m1VdwNOWhWI,177850,180840,had cheesy bread?
m1VdwNOWhWI,180840,182349,"- I mean, if you had to put me against a wall"
m1VdwNOWhWI,182350,184108,"and said yes or no, do they have cheesy bread?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,184108,185653,- Hey! Do they have cheesy bread?
m1VdwNOWhWI,185653,186486,- Probably.
m1VdwNOWhWI,186486,187629,"- Do they, man. Do they?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,187630,188900,"- It's like, I mean, maybe."
m1VdwNOWhWI,188900,190140,It's a pizza place.
m1VdwNOWhWI,190140,192560,- [Stevie] I guess I just assumed
m1VdwNOWhWI,192560,195250,they only had pepperoni pizza and cheese pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,195250,196930,This is eye opening.
m1VdwNOWhWI,196930,198622,- You can order Chuck E. Cheese.
m1VdwNOWhWI,198623,199720,"- [Rhett] They're good, y'all."
m1VdwNOWhWI,199720,201170,- Can you get it delivered?
m1VdwNOWhWI,201170,202610,I mean-
m1VdwNOWhWI,202610,203443,- Would you?
m1VdwNOWhWI,204430,205590,- This looks good.
m1VdwNOWhWI,205590,206879,"You can? You can, right?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,206880,208713,"Yeah, so it is competitive in that way."
m1VdwNOWhWI,208713,209977,"- Oh, that's good too."
m1VdwNOWhWI,209977,212030,I'm just also very hungry.
m1VdwNOWhWI,212030,212880,- Hmm!
m1VdwNOWhWI,212880,214670,- [Rhett] Very different but also good.
m1VdwNOWhWI,214670,217187,- Little Caesar's uses 100% mozzarella
m1VdwNOWhWI,217187,219860,and Muenster cheese instead of cheese by product.
m1VdwNOWhWI,219860,221320,- Did you notice the Muenster?
m1VdwNOWhWI,221320,222153,- No.
m1VdwNOWhWI,222153,223320,"- When we did our, like what was it?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,223320,225510,"In-N-Out versus Shake Shack, people were like,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,225510,227890,they never talk about the difference in price!
m1VdwNOWhWI,227890,230400,"So I wanted to, I wanted to just let you notice the cheddar"
m1VdwNOWhWI,230400,231310,and I noticed the Muenster.
m1VdwNOWhWI,231310,234230,I wanted to notice that there is a difference in price here.
m1VdwNOWhWI,234230,236062,I'm not necessarily gonna take it into account
m1VdwNOWhWI,236063,239670,"but this is like 7.50 and that's like 4.50 or approximately,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,239670,242349,"so, you know, if we get stuck and we don't,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,242350,243910,"and we are gonna give some weight,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,243910,245150,we might go with the cheaper thing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,245150,246930,"Just, you know, 'cause it's affordable."
m1VdwNOWhWI,246930,248609,- Just going off taste first.
m1VdwNOWhWI,248610,250230,"That's nice, man."
m1VdwNOWhWI,250230,252827,"I'm giving that a nice, solid six."
m1VdwNOWhWI,255224,256690,- I'm giving it a seven.
m1VdwNOWhWI,256690,257709,I almost want to give it an eight.
m1VdwNOWhWI,257709,259032,- It is good. I am surprised.
m1VdwNOWhWI,259032,262509,There's almost an eggy quality to it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,262510,263647,"I know that's a weird thing to say, but like-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,263647,264480,- It's a very weird thing to say.
m1VdwNOWhWI,264480,266880,- It's a little spongy in a good way.
m1VdwNOWhWI,266880,269744,"This one, what puts it over the top is the-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,269744,270650,- Cheese.
m1VdwNOWhWI,270650,272810,"- The spices on top of the cheese, to me."
m1VdwNOWhWI,272810,273643,- Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,273643,275650,There's something kind of Italian.
m1VdwNOWhWI,275650,278030,- Clearly better and cheaper.
m1VdwNOWhWI,278030,279344,I'm giving it an eight.
m1VdwNOWhWI,279344,281229,- It is slightly better.
m1VdwNOWhWI,281230,283360,"I'm going, I'm going to eight as well."
m1VdwNOWhWI,283360,285360,I'm very impressed with this.
m1VdwNOWhWI,285360,286193,I mean-
m1VdwNOWhWI,286193,288035,"- Even though you gave it a lower score, yeah."
m1VdwNOWhWI,288035,290260,"- I gave it a seven, but this is, you know what?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,290260,291290,"This is like,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,291290,293850,feels like more traditional bready kind of thing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,293850,295570,Which I enjoy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,295570,296560,I wouldn't call this eggy
m1VdwNOWhWI,296560,298630,but there is maybe a pancake quality to it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,298630,299570,Look at that.
m1VdwNOWhWI,299570,301558,Who would've thunk that that's the bottom?
m1VdwNOWhWI,301558,303460,(rock music riffing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,303460,304293,Still hungry.
m1VdwNOWhWI,305352,306889,- Okay.
m1VdwNOWhWI,306890,308240,Hello.
m1VdwNOWhWI,308240,309429,Sorry.
m1VdwNOWhWI,309429,312095,(crew laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,313652,315211,"- What, what is this?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,315211,316992,"- This is our, I dunno. I'm sorry."
m1VdwNOWhWI,316992,318870,"- You're, you're doing, you're doing good."
m1VdwNOWhWI,318870,320313,- Just picture me as a locker.
m1VdwNOWhWI,320313,321315,- I dunno.
m1VdwNOWhWI,321316,325577,It came from a round pizza and it's got meat.
m1VdwNOWhWI,325577,328294,"It's got oh, it's got pepperoni and sausage,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,328294,331434,"and its oh, it's getting higher!"
m1VdwNOWhWI,331434,333124,- She's having a lot of trouble.
m1VdwNOWhWI,333124,334457,- It's $12. $12!
m1VdwNOWhWI,335837,337143,- $12.
m1VdwNOWhWI,337143,338057,- I think she said $12.
m1VdwNOWhWI,338057,340025,- She said it came from a round pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,340025,341418,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
m1VdwNOWhWI,341418,343053,- She's in pain.
m1VdwNOWhWI,344120,345840,So this is our meat pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,345840,348990,"It's got, you know, it's got sausage, bacon, ham."
m1VdwNOWhWI,348990,351120,It's got pepperoni and it's got beef.
m1VdwNOWhWI,351120,353540,All together for 25.99.
m1VdwNOWhWI,353540,355040,"So it's delicious, you'll love it."
m1VdwNOWhWI,355040,355873,Timmy!
m1VdwNOWhWI,356718,357580,Timmy!
m1VdwNOWhWI,357580,359539,"Do not. That is for whacking moles,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,359540,361143,not for whacking people!
m1VdwNOWhWI,362540,364360,"- Whack, Whack a Mole."
m1VdwNOWhWI,364360,366840,- Look at the meat size difference here.
m1VdwNOWhWI,366840,369180,"Like, I mean, when you take a little,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,369180,371360,"a little piece of this and a little piece of this, boy."
m1VdwNOWhWI,371360,373069,"- Well, you picked the smallest sausage."
m1VdwNOWhWI,373070,374710,"I mean, I can get you a bigger sausage."
m1VdwNOWhWI,374710,375543,But you're right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,375543,376376,- Give me the biggest sausage.
m1VdwNOWhWI,376376,377508,"- [Rhett] I mean, it is-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,377508,379935,- All of the sausages are much bigger in Caesar town.
m1VdwNOWhWI,379935,381880,"- Well, how do they taste, though?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,381880,383560,"You know, it all becomes the same size in your,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,383560,384393,in your colon.
m1VdwNOWhWI,385280,386970,"- Yeah, let's think about our colon."
m1VdwNOWhWI,386970,387883,- Pretty floppy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,390540,392720,- That is meaty and greasy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,392720,394290,As one would expect.
m1VdwNOWhWI,394290,397240,- I feel like I should be hearing the sounds
m1VdwNOWhWI,397240,399830,"of children and like, you know what I'm saying?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,399830,401030,"It's like, this is not great pizza."
m1VdwNOWhWI,401030,402135,- No.
m1VdwNOWhWI,402135,404499,"- [Stevie] Beef is unusual, no?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,404499,408117,'Cause usually the sausage is pork
m1VdwNOWhWI,408118,410500,and there is an added beef.
m1VdwNOWhWI,410500,411740,- There's sausage and beef.
m1VdwNOWhWI,411740,412573,- [Stevie] Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,412573,413406,- [Rhett] And hamburger.
m1VdwNOWhWI,413406,414640,- [Link] I'm tasting just that beef.
m1VdwNOWhWI,414640,415858,- [Rhett] I'm tasting just that beef.
m1VdwNOWhWI,415858,418240,"- It's nothing to rave about, Stevie."
m1VdwNOWhWI,418240,421259,"- Oh, the sausage by itself is actually really bad."
m1VdwNOWhWI,421259,422740,That's not doing it for me.
m1VdwNOWhWI,422740,423789,- Now this over here.
m1VdwNOWhWI,425210,426860,Look at the size of that sausage.
m1VdwNOWhWI,428000,430120,- Now I'm a sausage pizza man.
m1VdwNOWhWI,430120,431680,I don't normally love the pepperoni.
m1VdwNOWhWI,431680,433620,- Is that like strips of ham?
m1VdwNOWhWI,433620,434889,- [Link] Cubed bacon.
m1VdwNOWhWI,434890,436710,- [Rhett] And they also have regular bacon.
m1VdwNOWhWI,436710,438375,"That's not great either, but it is better."
m1VdwNOWhWI,438376,440547,"- Yeah, it's definitely better."
m1VdwNOWhWI,440547,442110,- I'm giving this a four.
m1VdwNOWhWI,442110,444447,- [Link] I'm gonna give it a three.
m1VdwNOWhWI,444447,445280,- Okay.
m1VdwNOWhWI,445280,446113,- It just wasn't.
m1VdwNOWhWI,446113,447500,I can't come up with anything good
m1VdwNOWhWI,447500,449820,to say about it except that it was pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,449820,450740,- They tried.
m1VdwNOWhWI,450740,451926,- They tried.
m1VdwNOWhWI,451926,456030,"Now, Caesar's not wowing me over here either, man."
m1VdwNOWhWI,456030,457730,- I'm giving it a five. I'm not going higher than a five.
m1VdwNOWhWI,457730,458563,- I agree.
m1VdwNOWhWI,458563,462039,I'm gonna give it a five because I like big 'ole sausage.
m1VdwNOWhWI,462040,463860,"- Yeah, who doesn't."
m1VdwNOWhWI,463860,465555,(rock music riffing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,465555,466889,"- All right,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,466890,471170,so these are the boneless Buffalo wings for 15.99.
m1VdwNOWhWI,471170,472070,"If you'll excuse me,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,472070,475160,I gotta go pretend to be an animatronic robot
m1VdwNOWhWI,475160,476475,because they got rid of those
m1VdwNOWhWI,476475,478010,and now I have to sing as a freakin' robot.
m1VdwNOWhWI,478010,479342,That's a fun job.
m1VdwNOWhWI,479342,480175,"- Wow, he's doing it himself."
m1VdwNOWhWI,480175,481237,"- Oh, they got rid of the animatronics?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,481237,482070,- [Charlie] Yep!
m1VdwNOWhWI,482070,482903,- Yeah. Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,482903,483860,- I got this.
m1VdwNOWhWI,483860,485435,All right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,485436,487100,- All right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,487100,492100,- These are our wings and the sauce is 8 99.
m1VdwNOWhWI,492420,495100,Nope. The sauce and the wings is 8 99.
m1VdwNOWhWI,495100,495933,Not just the sauce.
m1VdwNOWhWI,495933,496766,- Kit and caboodle.
m1VdwNOWhWI,496766,499389,- It is so scary outside of Little Caesar's.
m1VdwNOWhWI,499390,500223,(Rhett chuckling)
m1VdwNOWhWI,500223,501056,- Right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,501056,503006,Little Caesar's-
m1VdwNOWhWI,503006,504780,- It's affordable.
m1VdwNOWhWI,504780,506210,- They're affordable.
m1VdwNOWhWI,506210,507701,"So we have to, we have talk-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,507701,509379,"- I mean, 16 bucks versus 9 bucks?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,509380,511360,"And this isn't, this is just a portion."
m1VdwNOWhWI,511360,513890,I think there's more than this that come in an actual order.
m1VdwNOWhWI,513890,515840,- They're not only boneless.
m1VdwNOWhWI,515840,517560,"I mean, I just call this a nugget."
m1VdwNOWhWI,517560,519180,They're nuggets.
m1VdwNOWhWI,519180,520102,How do they taste?
m1VdwNOWhWI,521419,523219,- They taste like they might have been frozen at some point.
m1VdwNOWhWI,523219,524980,"- [Link] It's actual pieces of chicken, though."
m1VdwNOWhWI,524980,526839,- [Rhett] I could have a good night alone with these.
m1VdwNOWhWI,526840,529070,- Hanging out alone at the Chuck E. Cheese?
m1VdwNOWhWI,529070,529903,"- Yeah, yeah."
m1VdwNOWhWI,529903,530736,- Drinking beers.
m1VdwNOWhWI,530736,531640,- Nobody ever looks at me funny
m1VdwNOWhWI,531640,533750,when I go to the Chuck E. Cheese by myself and order-
m1VdwNOWhWI,533750,535139,- It's a place to take-
m1VdwNOWhWI,535139,535972,- [Rhett] And order the wings.
m1VdwNOWhWI,535972,536805,- Kids.
m1VdwNOWhWI,536805,537638,- It is?
m1VdwNOWhWI,537638,539550,It's a place to take kids.
m1VdwNOWhWI,539550,540870,"- I mean, it could also be a place"
m1VdwNOWhWI,540870,542850,to like get an instant family.
m1VdwNOWhWI,542850,544459,"I guess if you want to go there alone,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,544460,545534,is what I'm getting at.
m1VdwNOWhWI,545534,547820,"- I think you can meet, you could meet like a single,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,547820,550082,a single parent could meet another single parent.
m1VdwNOWhWI,550082,551220,- Yeah. That could work.
m1VdwNOWhWI,551220,553639,- I bet you that there's some romances have started there.
m1VdwNOWhWI,553639,554630,- So you're paying for that.
m1VdwNOWhWI,554630,555903,"I'm not trying to like,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,555903,558750,"think about what we scored things, but-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,558750,559583,- [Rhett] You're paying for love.
m1VdwNOWhWI,559583,561060,- You're paying for-
m1VdwNOWhWI,561060,561893,- [Rhett] The experience.
m1VdwNOWhWI,561893,563685,- Your kids to be distracted.
m1VdwNOWhWI,563685,564852,- Entertained.
m1VdwNOWhWI,567090,569180,- This is a bone-in wing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,569180,571380,It's legit. Decent.
m1VdwNOWhWI,571380,573040,It's got a black pepper punch.
m1VdwNOWhWI,573040,574279,- It's legit decent.
m1VdwNOWhWI,574280,578353,"- I kinda like the, the black peppery nature"
m1VdwNOWhWI,578353,579610,with the hot sauce.
m1VdwNOWhWI,579610,580911,- It's interesting.
m1VdwNOWhWI,580911,582480,The flavor profile is not bad.
m1VdwNOWhWI,582480,585370,It doesn't really feel like a real hot wing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,585370,587410,"It's got that sort of baked thing going on,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,587410,589529,"which I'm not that a huge, that big of a fan of."
m1VdwNOWhWI,589530,590640,I like more of a fried wing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,590640,591473,- Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,591473,592720,But all the pizza places wings
m1VdwNOWhWI,592720,594823,are gonna be baked in the ovens.
m1VdwNOWhWI,595771,597279,It's a lot better than this nugget.
m1VdwNOWhWI,597280,598720,"- I'm gonna give these a five 'cause like I said,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,598720,600795,I could enjoy these alone.
m1VdwNOWhWI,600795,602060,- I'm gonna give it a three
m1VdwNOWhWI,602060,605343,because this is like microwave level.
m1VdwNOWhWI,605343,606254,- That one's a little burnt.
m1VdwNOWhWI,606254,609230,- Like oven at home level experience.
m1VdwNOWhWI,609230,610779,- [Rhett] I'm gonna give this a six.
m1VdwNOWhWI,610780,614130,"- For a baked wing, I don't think it's that bad at all."
m1VdwNOWhWI,614130,615130,But I agree.
m1VdwNOWhWI,615130,618530,I can't give it more than a six in the world of wings.
m1VdwNOWhWI,618530,620272,"- Yeah, 'cause we're dealing with a world of wings."
m1VdwNOWhWI,620272,622836,World of wings opening soon.
m1VdwNOWhWI,622836,624700,(rock music riffing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,624700,626770,"Okay, before we try our next items,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,626770,628550,I got something I'm very excited about.
m1VdwNOWhWI,628550,631670,Over the years there's been a recurring guest on the show
m1VdwNOWhWI,631670,633500,that sort of stood out above the rest.
m1VdwNOWhWI,633500,638500,"He's real, real Southern and he loves to shag."
m1VdwNOWhWI,638528,640620,- And he's related to me.
m1VdwNOWhWI,640620,641580,- Can you guess who it is?
m1VdwNOWhWI,641580,643370,- It's my father.
m1VdwNOWhWI,643370,644560,- Yes. Link's dad.
m1VdwNOWhWI,644560,647023,- My dad. Charles. Charles.
m1VdwNOWhWI,649394,650227,We're gonna give him a podcast.
m1VdwNOWhWI,650227,651500,"- Yeah, we are!"
m1VdwNOWhWI,651500,652790,- And I'm gonna be his sidekick.
m1VdwNOWhWI,652790,655300,"I'm saying he, this is what I've been telling him."
m1VdwNOWhWI,655300,657670,"Dad, do you want a podcast?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,657671,659940,I'll be there for you.
m1VdwNOWhWI,659940,661440,I talked to my dad on the phone.
m1VdwNOWhWI,661440,664290,"I'm like, why don't we just turn that into a podcast?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,664290,666615,"You like listening to my dad talk, right?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,666616,669285,- Yes. Yes.
m1VdwNOWhWI,669285,670691,- [Charles] Yes.
m1VdwNOWhWI,670692,671859,- There it is.
m1VdwNOWhWI,673180,675279,"In a Mythical world,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,675279,680279,one man has stood out above the rest.
m1VdwNOWhWI,680460,683233,"- Hey boys, it's me, Link's dad."
m1VdwNOWhWI,683233,684639,- He's back!
m1VdwNOWhWI,684640,685860,- Total reset.
m1VdwNOWhWI,685860,686693,- He's back!
m1VdwNOWhWI,686693,691380,- [Link] And has inspired countless people with his words.
m1VdwNOWhWI,691380,693870,- Ain't no sugar in this cookie for you.
m1VdwNOWhWI,693870,698330,"For my birthday, my friends gave me a bunch of old dirt."
m1VdwNOWhWI,698330,701040,I told them I appreciate this sediment.
m1VdwNOWhWI,701040,703560,"No, I have never heard of oat milk."
m1VdwNOWhWI,703560,704890,"- [Link] But now,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,704890,708150,hear him like you've never heard him before.
m1VdwNOWhWI,708150,711570,- [Charles] I sure am a dirty boy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,711570,714513,- [Link] On his all new podcast.

m1VdwNOWhWI,728168,731700,"called Dispatches From Myrtle Beach, where my dad lives."
m1VdwNOWhWI,731700,735590,"He's gonna give me all the updates on his goings ons,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,735590,738803,his shagging and whatnot in the Myrtle Beach area.
m1VdwNOWhWI,739750,740583,- Full shagging details.
m1VdwNOWhWI,740583,742350,"- That's, that's, that's a, that's a dance."
m1VdwNOWhWI,742350,744410,- It just means dancin' in South Carolina.
m1VdwNOWhWI,744410,745990,- But who knows what he's up to?
m1VdwNOWhWI,745990,746823,- Right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,746823,748960,- So every week you can listen in on a conversation
m1VdwNOWhWI,748960,750610,"that I have with my dad, and you know what?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,750610,753668,I have published his email address
m1VdwNOWhWI,753668,755810,and we're gonna put it down here right now.
m1VdwNOWhWI,755810,759733,So it's ratherbeshaggin53@aol.com.
m1VdwNOWhWI,760666,763603,- [Charles] I am just not too risque for you two.

m1VdwNOWhWI,766520,768810,So if you wanna email my dad anything
m1VdwNOWhWI,768810,772750,"that he can respond to on Dispatches From Myrtle Beach,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,772750,773583,have at it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,773583,777070,If there's a joke that you want to tell me.
m1VdwNOWhWI,777070,780040,"You know, he was telling some dirty jokes on-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,780040,781868,"- Yeah, he's full of them."
m1VdwNOWhWI,781868,783113,"- On Good Mythical Evening, I believe."
m1VdwNOWhWI,783113,785500,"So yeah, you can email those to him."
m1VdwNOWhWI,785500,786980,"If you got any questions for him,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,786980,789130,"if you wanna, if you need any advice,"

m1VdwNOWhWI,799500,802330,And it is gonna premiere on June 16th.
m1VdwNOWhWI,802330,803720,So right in time for Father's Day.
m1VdwNOWhWI,803720,804790,Isn't that nice?
m1VdwNOWhWI,804790,805750,Isn't that nice?
m1VdwNOWhWI,805750,806810,- I'm looking forward to it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,806810,808785,- Episodes every Thursday.
m1VdwNOWhWI,808785,810600,"- All right, what do we have next?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,810600,812269,- Is it a mistake?
m1VdwNOWhWI,812270,813103,- I don't know.
m1VdwNOWhWI,813103,813950,"- Well, maybe that might be the beauty of it."
m1VdwNOWhWI,813950,814783,- I don't know.
m1VdwNOWhWI,814783,815616,- It might be the beauty of it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,815616,816774,- [Charles] Yes.
m1VdwNOWhWI,816774,817810,(Rhett laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,817810,818800,- That's my dad.
m1VdwNOWhWI,818800,820890,"- Who wouldn't rather be shagging, you know?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,820890,821740,- Right.
m1VdwNOWhWI,821740,823470,- So this is the veggie pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,823470,826470,"It's got green peppers, black olives."
m1VdwNOWhWI,826470,829459,"It's got red onions and it's got tomato,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,829460,831250,"and of course mushroom, and it's delicious,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,831250,832083,and you're gonna love it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,832083,834510,"And boy, howdy to me!"
m1VdwNOWhWI,834510,836700,Do not call me your father!
m1VdwNOWhWI,836700,839110,Just 'cause Link's dad is named Charlie
m1VdwNOWhWI,839110,841471,does not mean I'm your dad!
m1VdwNOWhWI,841471,843732,"- Well, he's had a little bit of an outburst there."
m1VdwNOWhWI,843732,845339,"- He's kind of, he's got anger issues."
m1VdwNOWhWI,845340,847010,- I'm feeling better.
m1VdwNOWhWI,847010,848999,I'm feeling a lot more confident.
m1VdwNOWhWI,848999,850584,(crew laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,850584,851417,"- Yeah, I'm feeling good."
m1VdwNOWhWI,851417,853010,- She's taking something.
m1VdwNOWhWI,853010,855610,- I just chugged a whole shot glass full of Buffalo sauce.
m1VdwNOWhWI,855610,857410,- Yeah. Okay.
m1VdwNOWhWI,857410,858810,- So this is our veggie pizza.
m1VdwNOWhWI,858810,861701,"It's got green peppers, onions, black olives,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,861701,866360,"and then it's got Italian seasoning on it, and it's $11."
m1VdwNOWhWI,866360,867850,Are those cameras?
m1VdwNOWhWI,867850,869509,"- No, no, no, no, no. They're not."
m1VdwNOWhWI,869510,870718,They're not. Don't worry.
m1VdwNOWhWI,870718,871581,- Have they been there the whole time?
m1VdwNOWhWI,871581,872414,"- Nope, no, this is just us."
m1VdwNOWhWI,872414,873247,- We're lockers. - We're just hanging out.
m1VdwNOWhWI,873247,874080,- More lockers. - Are they on?
m1VdwNOWhWI,874080,874913,- We're just hanging out.
m1VdwNOWhWI,874913,875948,- Oh no.
m1VdwNOWhWI,875948,877651,(crew laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,877651,880449,- I'm gonna take this one 'cause it has more olives.
m1VdwNOWhWI,880449,882368,I figure out you wanna avoid those olives.
m1VdwNOWhWI,882369,883911,- So this is much thinner.
m1VdwNOWhWI,883911,885439,- But that doesn't mean anything.
m1VdwNOWhWI,885439,886272,- Look at that.
m1VdwNOWhWI,886272,887105,When you get it together.
m1VdwNOWhWI,887105,888578,- [Rhett] Thin could be good sometimes.
m1VdwNOWhWI,888578,889610,- [Link] So you've got the same complexion.
m1VdwNOWhWI,889610,894448,"- Again, this is also $26 for the Chuck E. Cheese pizza."
m1VdwNOWhWI,894448,895770,$11.
m1VdwNOWhWI,895770,897790,"- You're paying for the ambiance, man."
m1VdwNOWhWI,897790,900290,You're paying to get your kids outta your hair.
m1VdwNOWhWI,900290,901680,- They got you trapped.
m1VdwNOWhWI,901680,902550,- They've got you trapped.
m1VdwNOWhWI,902550,905649,"- And this pizza tastes incredible when you're like,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,905650,907848,"trying to avoid your children, you know?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,907848,909931,- But just isolated?
m1VdwNOWhWI,909931,911210,- [Rhett] It's bad.
m1VdwNOWhWI,911210,913620,- Little Caesar's is not horrible
m1VdwNOWhWI,913620,915710,"and we've been surprised by how good it is,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,915710,918810,"but I mean, of all the food feuds, man."
m1VdwNOWhWI,918810,920491,This is not the greatest experience.
m1VdwNOWhWI,920491,921330,"- Yeah, I'm not having a great time."
m1VdwNOWhWI,921330,922847,- I'm just being honest.
m1VdwNOWhWI,922847,924500,"- The cheese, the bread,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,924500,927708,and the sauce is all better at Little Caesar's.
m1VdwNOWhWI,927708,929610,"- I mean, veggie pizza, man."
m1VdwNOWhWI,929610,931570,That is for the birds.
m1VdwNOWhWI,931570,932403,- Three.
m1VdwNOWhWI,934360,935193,- Three.
m1VdwNOWhWI,936320,937240,- Four.
m1VdwNOWhWI,937240,938503,- Four.
m1VdwNOWhWI,938503,939440,(Rhett laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,939440,941743,"- I mean, you know, it doesn't take much to win this round."
m1VdwNOWhWI,941743,943860,(rock music riffing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,943860,944763,Dessert.
m1VdwNOWhWI,947364,949330,- This is our brownie.
m1VdwNOWhWI,949330,952870,It has cookie dough icing on top and M&M's.
m1VdwNOWhWI,952870,954640,It's 3.89.
m1VdwNOWhWI,954640,956110,"I'm looking right at it, aren't I?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,956110,956943,- Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,956943,957776,- I should've been doing this the whole time.
m1VdwNOWhWI,957776,958609,- Yep.
m1VdwNOWhWI,958609,959442,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
m1VdwNOWhWI,959442,960463,"- Yeah, yeah."
m1VdwNOWhWI,960463,961296,- You're good.
m1VdwNOWhWI,961296,962129,- You're doing great.
m1VdwNOWhWI,962129,962962,"- Creep, almost creepy."
m1VdwNOWhWI,962962,965350,"- This is our chocolate chip cookie for 7.49,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,965350,968850,"and this is my son, Timmy."
m1VdwNOWhWI,968850,969761,- Oh.
m1VdwNOWhWI,969762,970807,- He's a-
m1VdwNOWhWI,970807,972850,(Charlie grunting)
m1VdwNOWhWI,972850,974677,Why do you have a beard?
m1VdwNOWhWI,974677,976760,(crew laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,976760,980762,"- Wow, striking resemblance to Chase on his knees."
m1VdwNOWhWI,980762,983510,(Rhett laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,983510,984343,You know?
m1VdwNOWhWI,984343,985470,- I've never seen Chase on his knees.
m1VdwNOWhWI,985470,986699,- Chase on his knees. Yeah.
m1VdwNOWhWI,986700,989640,(crew laughing)
m1VdwNOWhWI,989640,992640,- Now this looks promising. Finally!
m1VdwNOWhWI,992640,993473,- This looks like a party.
m1VdwNOWhWI,993473,995450,- Chuck E. Cheese is coming through!
m1VdwNOWhWI,995450,996470,"- 'Cause you know, it's like a birthday party place"
m1VdwNOWhWI,996470,997303,and you get the cookie cake.
m1VdwNOWhWI,997303,1000365,- Now we are ranking these on a scale of one to five
m1VdwNOWhWI,1000366,1003870,because it ain't all about the dessert.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1003870,1006200,We're gonna do some weighting.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1006200,1007507,- That's pretty dang good.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1007507,1008590,- [Link] Mm!
m1VdwNOWhWI,1008590,1009423,- It's very doughy.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1009423,1010500,- It's a Pizookie!
m1VdwNOWhWI,1010500,1011950,"- I mean, I've had better and this,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,1011950,1013210,but this is the best thing.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1013210,1015170,This is the best thing at Chuck E. Cheese right here.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1015170,1017310,"- [Link] Oh yes, that is good."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1017310,1018143,- I'm giving it a four.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1018143,1018976,I can't go all the way to five.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1018976,1019809,It's not perfect.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1019809,1021114,- Oh man.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1021114,1022870,I'ma gladly give that a five.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1022870,1024010,"- Well, do it."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1024010,1026170,"- [Link] Now, this right here."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1026170,1027240,- It's got little baby M&M's on it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1027240,1029309,"- This is, this is scary."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1029310,1032270,- It's like blonde brownie on top of a regular brownie.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1032270,1034329,- I'm gonna taste it without the little M&M's.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1034329,1036419,"- Oh, that's icing or something on top."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1036420,1037339,"- Yeah, it's very thin."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1037339,1039140,Like you could just scrape all that off.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1039140,1039973,It's like very-
m1VdwNOWhWI,1039973,1041740,- [Rhett] Cookie dough frosting.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1041740,1043510,"- Yes, it is cookie dough frosting."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1043510,1044343,- That's also not that bad.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1044343,1047150,"- That is, that, I've never had cookie dough frosting."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1047150,1048580,- Now that I understand what it is.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1048580,1050331,"- [Link] I know, that's interesting."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1050332,1051165,It feels like I'll get sick
m1VdwNOWhWI,1051165,1052610,before I realize I shouldn't keep eating it.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1052610,1053770,- I'm gonna give it a three.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1053770,1056610,"I don't think it's great, but I would finish it."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1056610,1058640,- I like cookie dough frosting.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1058640,1059473,"- This is better, though."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1059473,1061910,"- But this is, this is so much better."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1061910,1063175,I agree.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1063175,1064883,I'm gonna give this a three.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1066435,1068010,- Okay. There we go.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1068010,1069760,- So let's get those totals.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1069760,1071870,"- We got Chuck E. Cheese with 43 points,"
m1VdwNOWhWI,1071870,1074410,but Little Caesar's with 52 points.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1074410,1075610,I can't say you should be that proud
m1VdwNOWhWI,1075610,1076730,because it was not too difficult
m1VdwNOWhWI,1076730,1078740,to beat Chuck E. Cheese on this particular day.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1078740,1080809,"I mean, we'll still accept a sponsorship."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1080810,1083473,- I think this may be our lowest overall
m1VdwNOWhWI,1083473,1086730,total points combined food feud ever.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1086730,1087830,"- Very, very likely."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1087830,1088663,- Very likely.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1088663,1090220,"- But I mean, you gotta start somewhere, right?"
m1VdwNOWhWI,1090220,1092411,- Some days you're gonna be disappointed with this show.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1092411,1094750,"From the inside out, at least."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1094750,1096350,- Thanks for subscribing and clicking that bell.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1096350,1097183,- You know what time it is.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1097183,1098603,- Where's your son?
m1VdwNOWhWI,1098603,1099490,- I'm here!
m1VdwNOWhWI,1099490,1100323,"- Jo, wassup!"
m1VdwNOWhWI,1100323,1102030,"It's big J and here is my homie,"

m1VdwNOWhWI,1110780,1112990,I don't know what the cat's name
m1VdwNOWhWI,1112990,1114540,'cause I can't spell that fast.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1115450,1116850,Did he spell mutton?
m1VdwNOWhWI,1116850,1117803,"- I, yeah, I can't, I can't hear the-"
m1VdwNOWhWI,1117803,1120410,"- M to the U, to the T, to the T, to the O, to the N."
m1VdwNOWhWI,1120410,1121243,I don't know what he said.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1121243,1122076,- That's mutton.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1122076,1122909,- [Stevie] Autumn.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1122909,1123742,- Autumn?
m1VdwNOWhWI,1123742,1124575,- [Stevie] Autumn.
m1VdwNOWhWI,1124575,1126371,"- See, I knew it was something similar to mutton."
