VUpQVZVxPmY,1106640,1113600,2020 and 2021 who are graduating with us  in this ceremony  somehow there was a positive side to the
VUpQVZVxPmY,1113600,1120160,coveted pandemic and now we all get to  graduate together  this worked out what for the best of me
VUpQVZVxPmY,1120160,1126000,as now i get to attend this graduation  with even more of my friends from  previous classes
VUpQVZVxPmY,1126000,1131919,it took a lot of hard work  many sleepless nights and lots of  academic pressure to get here
VUpQVZVxPmY,1131919,1137200,but now we stand proudly as euc  graduates who will become active
VUpQVZVxPmY,1137200,1142880,professional citizens in our communities  i am very honored and proud to be
VUpQVZVxPmY,1142880,1153039,standing in front of you today not only  as the valedictorian of the class of  2022 but also a palestinian musician
VUpQVZVxPmY,1153039,1158960,growing up as an arab and occupied  jerusalem i cannot say i had a normal  life
VUpQVZVxPmY,1158960,1164320,during my childhood my school was raided  by military forces at least three times
VUpQVZVxPmY,1164320,1171120,that i can remember  my music conservatory as well  i as a musician could not collaborate
VUpQVZVxPmY,1171120,1176640,with other musicians from the west bank  so easily as the occupation divided us
VUpQVZVxPmY,1176640,1182320,i remember traveling through the  checkpoints to be able to practice with  my friends in different cities in the
VUpQVZVxPmY,1182320,1189280,west bank which was definitely not easy  and the journey that can take up to two  hours for a city that's only 15
VUpQVZVxPmY,1189280,1196080,kilometers away  through those collaborate collaborations  i met a teacher who is now a great
VUpQVZVxPmY,1196080,1202000,scholar in boston and also a dear friend  of mine  once we were discussing music and
VUpQVZVxPmY,1202000,1208559,occupation and she asked me to think and  reflect on some sayings  one of which was this
VUpQVZVxPmY,1208559,1214720,how can music be used as a passport  now i did not understand this at first
VUpQVZVxPmY,1214720,1220000,and had to reflect  what does music have in common with a  passport
VUpQVZVxPmY,1220000,1226400,it was a difficult question especially  for someone who does not actually have a  passport
VUpQVZVxPmY,1226400,1232720,it took me some time to reflect on that  and only was able to understand it  through my time here
VUpQVZVxPmY,1232720,1238799,i realized that although because i live  in jerusalem i am unable to provide
VUpQVZVxPmY,1238799,1244720,evidence on paper that i am palestinian  i am definitely able to provide evidence
VUpQVZVxPmY,1244720,1250240,that i am a musician  during my studies here i have
VUpQVZVxPmY,1250240,1256000,collaborated with musicians from cyprus  ireland italy greece the seychelles and
VUpQVZVxPmY,1256000,1263200,the usa  all of us bound together by our art with  the statement that music is a passport
VUpQVZVxPmY,1263200,1270880,music becomes something much stronger  and powerful than any occupation or  illegal borders that are used to divide
VUpQVZVxPmY,1270880,1277600,us  i am so proud to be european university  cypress graduate in music
VUpQVZVxPmY,1277600,1283919,this music program gave me the  opportunity and knowledge to become a  skilled professional

VUpQVZVxPmY,1438799,1444880,of you all of us have chosen an academic  career path that not only leads to a job
VUpQVZVxPmY,1444880,1450799,but also through it we get to impact and  influence the lives of others too

VUpQVZVxPmY,1470080,1475360,we actually care  not everyone makes this choice but we
VUpQVZVxPmY,1475360,1482320,did and you should all be proud of  yourselves  this journey has not been an easy one
VUpQVZVxPmY,1482320,1488960,four years ago when we started  everything was different four years ago  the world was not in the same place that
VUpQVZVxPmY,1488960,1494159,it is today things have changed  and they've changed in such a fast and
VUpQVZVxPmY,1494159,1500400,unpredictable way that you could have  never imagined  after just a first-year students we had
VUpQVZVxPmY,1500400,1507679,to face the covenant 19 pandemic and its  consequences we had to leave behind our  regular classes our friends they thought
VUpQVZVxPmY,1507679,1514000,of normal college year  our comfort zones and at that time  aspiration and we had to adjust to the
VUpQVZVxPmY,1514000,1520400,uncertain reality of the concept of the  circumstances  we had to lock ourselves in our dorms
VUpQVZVxPmY,1520400,1527760,houses or bedrooms and we had to learn  and cope with this new system of study  of attending classes of taking exams
VUpQVZVxPmY,1527760,1534960,a new system and way of living  we are forever grateful that our  university was extremely fast in
VUpQVZVxPmY,1534960,1540720,transitioning to the online learning  system and for giving us all the support  and guidance that we most certainly
VUpQVZVxPmY,1540720,1546480,needed  times were hard  we didn't just stay home keeping safe
VUpQVZVxPmY,1546480,1553279,trying to somehow spend our hours like  many of the people all over the world  did as students we had a different
VUpQVZVxPmY,1553279,1561039,situation to deal with  we had to stay home protect ourselves in  order and simultaneously work hard
VUpQVZVxPmY,1561039,1568159,holding on to our dreams while worrying  about the entire world we did not give  up none of you did that's why you're
VUpQVZVxPmY,1568159,1573360,here tonight because when things got  hard we adjusted ourselves change our
VUpQVZVxPmY,1573360,1579600,perspective on things quickly learned  how to navigate through this new system  held our hair
VUpQVZVxPmY,1579600,1585360,halves high and continued what we came  here to do to follow our dreams
VUpQVZVxPmY,1585360,1590640,we can all remember how hard it was but  we did not give up we grew through what
VUpQVZVxPmY,1590640,1598240,we went through we became more resilient  and prove to ourselves that we can do  anything we put our minds and hearts to
VUpQVZVxPmY,1598240,1605760,we proved to be stronger than we ever  thought we could be  a japanese writer haruki murakami once
VUpQVZVxPmY,1605760,1611120,wrote that when you come out of the  storm you won't be the same person who  walked in
VUpQVZVxPmY,1611120,1617840,that is what the storm is all about  we are not the same people we were when  we first stepped on campus
VUpQVZVxPmY,1617840,1622960,now we're closer to our dreams to what  has led us here in the first place we
VUpQVZVxPmY,1622960,1629039,have graduated successfully from our  programs and have acquired knowledge and  experiences that will guide us through
VUpQVZVxPmY,1629039,1636720,our whole life  the storm has taught us so much how  things especially in life are not always
VUpQVZVxPmY,1636720,1644240,under our control that sometimes our  plans mean nothing that and that what we  have in mind can be quickly shattered
VUpQVZVxPmY,1644240,1651120,that mistakes failures setbacks grief  and loss are part of life as much as joy
VUpQVZVxPmY,1651120,1658080,love and happiness is  the storm also taught us how to fight  back how to stand up and how to
VUpQVZVxPmY,1658080,1666720,persevere in the face of adversity to  never lose sight of our destination and  vision but to be flexible in our methods
VUpQVZVxPmY,1666720,1672080,these past four years have been a life  school and an academic school and we did
VUpQVZVxPmY,1672080,1677520,it  one might say that i sound like a  hopeless romantic or a forever optimist
VUpQVZVxPmY,1677520,1683360,but this is not entirely true i just  like all of you have known loss defeat
VUpQVZVxPmY,1683360,1689919,failure sickness shame loneliness and  guilt  it's all a part of the human experience
VUpQVZVxPmY,1689919,1697919,but standing here in front of you  tonight fills with so much gratitude for  i am part of the class of 2022
