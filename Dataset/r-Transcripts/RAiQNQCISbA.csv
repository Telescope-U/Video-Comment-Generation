RAiQNQCISbA,240,5839,praful patel who is also here at the  residence of sharatha now what it  appears is that we were earlier
RAiQNQCISbA,5839,11360,expecting that there would be post two  o'clock meeting of opposition leaders  inside the parliament that is what was
RAiQNQCISbA,11360,16640,scheduled as of yesterday as of this  morning but now given the sudden  developments in maharashtra it appears
RAiQNQCISbA,16640,23279,that mr pawar is consulting with all of  the opposition parties and it appears  that uh this meeting could be uh you
RAiQNQCISbA,23279,28720,know what he has to say as far as the  opposition presidential candidate is  concerned the name of yeshwan sinha was
RAiQNQCISbA,28720,35280,proposed at yesterday's meeting is what  sources have indicated to us and now of  course uh with yeshwa himself tweeting
RAiQNQCISbA,35280,42000,that he would want to work for a larger  course of the nation uh for opposition  unity uh is what we understand uh is the
RAiQNQCISbA,42000,48160,meaning of that and therefore in fact  the name of yashwan sinha being proposed  something that perhaps the tmc also
RAiQNQCISbA,48160,54879,might not have objection to given that  yeshua sunnah has been a vice president  of  congress so how things transpire at this
RAiQNQCISbA,54879,60879,meeting remains to be seen but in the  midst of this crisis uh uh sir power of  course was in the national capital to
RAiQNQCISbA,60879,66400,actually host and invite all political  parties for that all-important  opposition meeting but it does seem that
RAiQNQCISbA,66400,72000,opposition leaders who met yesterday and  now of course another meeting that is  currently underway to decide on what the
RAiQNQCISbA,72000,77759,opposition strategy as far as the  presidential candidate is concerned now  ashok chavan the congress leader is
RAiQNQCISbA,77759,83600,chairing an emergency meet of the  congress camp like i said the top brass  of the congress the ship cena the ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,83600,90400,all in a hurdle now in a damage control  mode as well sanjay route claims they  are in touch with aiknow there so does
RAiQNQCISbA,90400,96960,nana patole of the congress and now  there's a emergency meeting taking place  as well let's listen this may
RAiQNQCISbA,96960,103200,not be  any reason for  anybody for us sir after the mlc poll
RAiQNQCISbA,103200,109600,results you also said that this should  be looked after and look upon very  seriously uh how does it look for the
RAiQNQCISbA,109600,115520,master government now  as regards cross-voting of any party is  concerned
RAiQNQCISbA,115520,120960,we should introspect we should  introspect  and see how
RAiQNQCISbA,120960,126159,the things can be appropriately settled  sir the member of parliament from mba
RAiQNQCISbA,126159,131680,sanjay out stated that there is a  conspiracy to topple the government  see
RAiQNQCISbA,131680,139120,bjp is making these type of efforts in  every  state wherever congress is ruling or
RAiQNQCISbA,139120,144239,oppositions are ruling  they it is they who engineered operation
RAiQNQCISbA,144239,151280,kamala you know  and they don't believe in  democracy this type of activities they
RAiQNQCISbA,151280,158720,are fully involved  and  now people have started understanding  that i don't think
RAiQNQCISbA,158720,166400,they will dare to do again the same  wrong  same bad tactics in maharashtra so last
RAiQNQCISbA,166400,172239,question  how are things going to be from now on  and also uh considering that ncp supremo
RAiQNQCISbA,172239,179680,shell power also called upon an  emergency meeting  repeat the question sir ncp supremum
RAiQNQCISbA,179680,188159,also called upon an emergency meeting  how are things going to be from now and  you are considering that you are also  the in charge of the master as a iacc
RAiQNQCISbA,188159,193920,yeah any  leader every leader will call for  immediate
RAiQNQCISbA,193920,199040,meeting they will stalk  they will take stock of the situation  because
RAiQNQCISbA,199040,206879,we are to  discuss and take  precautions if there are any to be taken
RAiQNQCISbA,206879,214400,opposition's presidential candidate and  the decision that is expected to be  taken on that as far as the meeting the
RAiQNQCISbA,214400,221040,second round uh that was going to happen  today we're given to understand that  yashwan sinha's name has been finalized
RAiQNQCISbA,221040,226159,by the opposition 17 parties were  invited they were supposed to be part of
RAiQNQCISbA,226159,233599,this opposition meeting yashwan sinha  this morning took to twitter he said he
RAiQNQCISbA,233599,241120,is  hoping that a larger responsibility is  entrusted on him and his parties chief
RAiQNQCISbA,241120,247360,mumta banerjee approves of that looks  like it's not just an approval from  mumta banerjee but from a united
RAiQNQCISbA,247360,253439,opposition as well because yashan sinha  is now the consensus candidate as far as
RAiQNQCISbA,253439,258238,the presidential election is concerned  for the opposition
RAiQNQCISbA,259120,264720,remember this also comes at a time when  three candidates declined the offer  gopal krishna gandhi
RAiQNQCISbA,264720,272800,and farooq abdullah were the three picks  that the opposition had made all three  of whom denied to take them up on the
RAiQNQCISbA,272800,277840,offer they had different reasons for it  madras gopala krishnan senior editor
RAiQNQCISbA,277840,284000,with me for more on this  looks like yeshwan sinha  is the consent candidate now
RAiQNQCISbA,284000,290400,yes uh it is all but confirmed just a  formal announcement is what is awaited  at this point of time and just a few  moments from now an opposition press
RAiQNQCISbA,290400,296400,conference is going to begin where in  fact the formal announcements is going  to be made sharing this meeting called
RAiQNQCISbA,296400,301520,the opposition leaders  of the congress party leaders of various  other opposition parties including the
RAiQNQCISbA,301520,308320,left are present and tmc also present at  this meeting the sp the rjd cpi ml the  national conference amongst the parties
RAiQNQCISbA,308320,314560,that are present along with the aid of  the rsp and other political parties uh  the ncp also present over here the mi
RAiQNQCISbA,314560,321039,i'm also attending this meeting as is  the iuml so uh we are expecting these 15  political parties and at this particular
RAiQNQCISbA,321039,328160,press conference to make the  announcement  of mr yeshun sir formally as the  opposition channel by the nation they
RAiQNQCISbA,328160,333840,can the first letter had the signature  of 34 shifts in mls three short of the
RAiQNQCISbA,333840,340639,magic number 37 is the magic number  after 37 this  in the camp can avoid the anti-defection
RAiQNQCISbA,340639,346400,law but in that letter they had clearly  made this point that ikna shinde is our
RAiQNQCISbA,346400,353199,group leader he was removed as yesterday  but that was unconstitutional that's  what they had said and we have alienated
RAiQNQCISbA,353199,359919,we have separated from uh the syria  buddha  because we feel that hindu has been
RAiQNQCISbA,359919,366319,majorly compromised that's what they had  pointed towards and also said that the  new alliance partners that cm udata had
RAiQNQCISbA,366319,372639,made that is the congress and the ncp  they have been poaching our voters they  have been creating trouble in our
RAiQNQCISbA,372639,380960,constituencies and that's why we cannot  compromise uh hindu for the sake of  hindu we have appointed our new leader
RAiQNQCISbA,383199,389440,to the deputy speaker of maharashtra  basically saying that yesterday uh the  new appointment of group leader was made
RAiQNQCISbA,389440,396240,by cm udot  replacing  with ajay  remember a group leader enjoys a certain
RAiQNQCISbA,396240,403199,kind of authority and power uh in the  floor of the assembly and that's why  that decision was taken by uh cm udd
RAiQNQCISbA,403199,408880,obviously uh after con  having a conversation with sarah pravar
RAiQNQCISbA,409840,417120,over there saying that only 16 mlas were  present in that meeting with only 16  mlas you cannot remove a group leader
RAiQNQCISbA,417120,422639,and appoint a new one so i basically we  are appointing a new whip that will be
RAiQNQCISbA,422639,430560,uh mr gogave from our end so clearly our  rhetoric has been set up by the nation
RAiQNQCISbA,431199,437280,where the letter said the resolution  there has been grace dissatisfaction  prevalent among members of our party the
RAiQNQCISbA,437280,443759,shivsena and our party carter at large  on account of corruption in government  then they say our party carder face
RAiQNQCISbA,443759,449759,tremendous harassment and distress on  political as well as personal grounds  from opposition ideological parties who
RAiQNQCISbA,449759,454880,are now part of the government then they  are saying that these parties of course
RAiQNQCISbA,454880,460000,the ncp and congress what they are  talking about are using their office and  power to undermine the base and
RAiQNQCISbA,460000,466319,foundation of our ships in our carter  that is enormous discontent among the  carder and there has been a compromise
RAiQNQCISbA,466319,471840,on principles of our party the shiv sena  which has a fierce ideological base
RAiQNQCISbA,471840,477199,which is why many are now wondering  sharon whether it is only the ship cena
RAiQNQCISbA,477199,482319,and independents who are seeing a  defection or is there trouble in
RAiQNQCISbA,482319,485919,congress paradise as well sharon
RAiQNQCISbA,489520,495919,well as far as the ncp and congress is  concerned it seems that they have in  fact taking in fact a step back as far
RAiQNQCISbA,495919,502800,as this whole nba maha vikas gardi  crisis is concerned because congress  have been saying that we have 44 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,502800,509360,and those those mlas are in fact intact  with us they had a meeting today yes the  problem concerning the cross voting is
RAiQNQCISbA,509360,516479,something that they are looking into but  as far as the mlas are concerned they  are very very much with us but as far as
RAiQNQCISbA,516479,522479,ships in is concerned this is their  owners this is their responsibility to  get the house in order and they have
RAiQNQCISbA,522479,529279,been saying this not just the congress  but the ncp also maintains the same line  that the shift sena needs to get their
RAiQNQCISbA,529279,535600,house in order now this is a serious  allegation that has been pointed out in  this resolution by the aknac shinde cam
RAiQNQCISbA,535600,542640,that the opposition like parties are  part of this alliance so clearly they  are in fact hitting out at congress and
RAiQNQCISbA,542640,549360,the ncp whether the ship senate whether  rudolph was very much aware about this  discontent within the mlas that they
RAiQNQCISbA,549360,555120,were not very much happy with this  alliance was there something that was  discussed before or this is happening
RAiQNQCISbA,555120,560240,now all this is something that udaptake  really need well the interesting thing  is that a lot of
RAiQNQCISbA,560240,565279,mlas are now saying we wrote you a  letter pratap sarnaek wrote a letter one
RAiQNQCISbA,565279,571279,year ago in june 2021 saying we must go  back to our roots we must go back to our
RAiQNQCISbA,571279,576720,ideological ally the bjp that was  ignored there is also in fact a
RAiQNQCISbA,576720,583120,statement that was given at that time by  members of the shiv cena saying that we  are facing harassment at the hands of
RAiQNQCISbA,583120,590000,guardian ministers of the congress and  ncp the question now being asked is and  let me take that across to two senior
RAiQNQCISbA,590000,597120,journalists who are joining us now  ashitosha and shekhar iyar do you think  ashitoshi that uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,597120,605440,ignored signs of discontent much to his  own uh or rather to his parties lost now
RAiQNQCISbA,605440,611040,see uh  it seems that hakare seems to be an  immature leader
RAiQNQCISbA,611040,617920,he forgot that he is  not running a shiv sena but he is  running a par a government which is uh
RAiQNQCISbA,617920,623440,standing on three crutches  and uh  shiva sena has just only 56 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,623440,629279,supported by ncp in the congress  and it was evident from the day one
RAiQNQCISbA,629279,634959,when the thakrei government was formed  that the vjp will not let this  government
RAiQNQCISbA,634959,640079,uh continue for five years it was very  very evident it was very very clear and  everybody knew
RAiQNQCISbA,640079,645440,despite that  if  if uddha thakrei could not keep his
RAiQNQCISbA,645440,652399,flock together if he could not if he  remained unaccessible to their own  senior leaders if a senior leader like
RAiQNQCISbA,652399,658079,aikman shinde had to uh to feel  marginalized in the party itself
RAiQNQCISbA,658079,664880,that shows that undoubtedly  remained a prince  who could not become
RAiQNQCISbA,664880,670399,somebody  uh who had to understand that the  dynamics of the politics has changed in
RAiQNQCISbA,670399,678000,india and it is now  either this way or that way so and  secondly i think without taking
RAiQNQCISbA,678000,684959,more than one  where is the master strategist named  sharat tawar when in 2019 when the
RAiQNQCISbA,684959,690320,uddhav thakri formed the government with  two allies everybody said look what a
RAiQNQCISbA,690320,696240,great politician what a great character  is  i'm sorry to interrupt you but we are
RAiQNQCISbA,696240,701839,getting more news right now from mumbai  ajit pavar and that's the big news  breaking at this point ajit pavara is
RAiQNQCISbA,701839,707040,having a meeting regarding the future of  the maha vikas agari it also bears
RAiQNQCISbA,707040,713600,mention i will go across to my  colleagues on the ground on this but  before we go any further a quick look  even as the chief minister is about to
RAiQNQCISbA,713600,719600,speak on where the numbers stand right  now in the 287 seat vidhan sabha in
RAiQNQCISbA,719600,726079,maharashtra there are 32 cena rebels and  two independents who are currently in  guwahati uh there are two more senate
RAiQNQCISbA,726079,734800,mlas who could be on their way to assam  so mlas who right now are in the uddhav  camp are only 16 5 remain non-committal
RAiQNQCISbA,734800,740959,and if indeed not shinde wants to stay  claimed to be the real shifts in or as  some people are saying he'll all
RAiQNQCISbA,740959,747680,likelihood call his factions shiv sena  he needs the magic number of 37 to duck
RAiQNQCISbA,747680,752720,the anti-defection law this becomes  significant keeping in mind that you
RAiQNQCISbA,752720,758399,have only 34 signatures including one  nitin deshmoo who subsequently came back
RAiQNQCISbA,758399,765279,to mumbai on that letter on that  resolution that was eventually sent to  the speaker so right now 37 is the magic
RAiQNQCISbA,765279,772639,number 33 is the actual number which  eight night shinde has in black and  white aruni coming across to you ajit
RAiQNQCISbA,772639,779920,pawar holding a meeting what's going on  behind the scenes because yesterday as  shiv sena was in the midst of the worst
RAiQNQCISbA,779920,787720,crisis ajit pawar was hosting an  administrative meeting almost as if  nothing had happened
RAiQNQCISbA,789760,797279,well that is right in the morning  ajithavar indeed uh was hosting an  administrative meeting but in the  evening he had come over here along with
RAiQNQCISbA,797279,802320,jayant patel another ncp senior leader  and they had a meeting with asean
RAiQNQCISbA,802320,808560,over here but now ajit pawan  individually having a meeting with the  ncp leaders regarding the future of the
RAiQNQCISbA,808560,816160,mahabhika-sagari government how where  does the ncp stand now what all options  the ncp party will have now all those
RAiQNQCISbA,816160,822000,things have been discussed by the deputy  cm of maharashtra um  because you follow the maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,822000,829360,politics so closely yesterday when  shahrukh was asked could you go with the  bjp he said  sensible savage but the fact is ajit
RAiQNQCISbA,829360,836000,pava just three years ago actually took  oath along with devendra farnavis is  there even the slightest of chance that
RAiQNQCISbA,836000,843399,there could be a coming together of  these two parties  if it is needed that is
RAiQNQCISbA,843760,849680,well  well if we actually look at it coming  together of iknow
RAiQNQCISbA,849680,857199,and  of the vendra fundamentals is actually  the possibility now because the kind of  attacks that syria muda takre has made
RAiQNQCISbA,857199,862240,on bjp or vice versa the kind of attacks  that devendra navis has made on cm with
RAiQNQCISbA,862240,868720,the thakre it becomes extremely  difficult now padma jai finance to look  at it because sanjay out every day used
RAiQNQCISbA,868720,875680,to write in the mouthpiece of samna  against pm modi against devendra navis  and they used to call their decision of
RAiQNQCISbA,875680,882160,breaking away from a bjp as a master  stroke saying that they were in fact  they were punished when they were being
RAiQNQCISbA,882160,888959,with the with the bjp the hindu of the  bjp is fake that's all those things  there is to say that time so whether cm
RAiQNQCISbA,888959,895360,without hakarei will merge with uh with  will make an alliance with the bjp that  becomes that looks extremely bleak
RAiQNQCISbA,895360,901839,extremely difficult but yes ikna shinde  is somebody who is who can who can  basically float his own party or say
RAiQNQCISbA,901839,907279,that our shift is the real chipset  we're just hearing that  the dress has been delayed we're
RAiQNQCISbA,907279,913360,supposed to be at five it's already 11  past five sharapova likely to meet the  chief minister also in the evening why
RAiQNQCISbA,913360,918160,the delay radhika  what are you hearing
RAiQNQCISbA,919199,925560,okay we seem to have lost that line  aruni why the delay what are you hearing
RAiQNQCISbA,929680,934959,expected to speak at 5pm now whether  he's also in whether his team is also in
RAiQNQCISbA,934959,942079,two minds whether they are also playing  the wait and watch game whether they are  also going through the  technicalities involved with respect to
RAiQNQCISbA,942079,947600,sacking of the rebel mlas all those  things have been studied by them that is  the big point of question that comes to
RAiQNQCISbA,947600,952639,the poor i was pointing towards the fact  that  himself is having a meeting obviously he
RAiQNQCISbA,952639,958160,must be nothing he must be having a  conversation with cm without taking as  well so everything that will be decided
RAiQNQCISbA,958160,963600,by cm udot  that will be in accordance with the his  alliance partners also that is the
RAiQNQCISbA,963600,970800,congress and the ncp and if you go by  the cabinet meeting which i attended  some time back the other mahavika sagadi
RAiQNQCISbA,970800,977519,leaders the congress and the ncp leaders  seemed a bit confident on the technical  grounds however the two letters that
RAiQNQCISbA,977519,982560,ikna shinde has sent now that basically  again opens a pandara box
RAiQNQCISbA,982560,988480,okay the two letters that are neal is  talking about  one of the letters in fact is the one
RAiQNQCISbA,988480,995759,that has been sent as an ultimatum to  the rebel cena mlas before i come across  to you sheikha
RAiQNQCISbA,995759,1001199,letter that was sent was  a whip of sorts which said that the mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,1001199,1006880,have to come to varsha bangla which is  the chief minister's residence at 5 00  pm  barring
RAiQNQCISbA,1006880,1013040,this if this does not happen if the  rebels do not turn up then they are  going to be removed from the party if
RAiQNQCISbA,1013040,1018560,you can go ahead that is what the letter  says you will not be exempt from  attending this meeting unless valid
RAiQNQCISbA,1018560,1025038,reasons are given and if you fail to  attend meeting it will be assumed that  you have left the shift say now
RAiQNQCISbA,1025038,1031918,willingly and finally they say action  will be taken against you in accordance  to the law of the land if you leave
RAiQNQCISbA,1031918,1038000,party sheker explain to us this is a  whip of sorts that was sent by the cena
RAiQNQCISbA,1038000,1044000,subsequently a letter was sent back by  eiknath shinde's faction saying you  aren't even the real senator we don't
RAiQNQCISbA,1044000,1049200,even recognize you your whip is illegal  now what happens 5 p.m that meeting 34
RAiQNQCISbA,1049200,1054720,of these people did not come can they be  disqualified what happens then
RAiQNQCISbA,1054720,1060720,well uh  what we are witnessing now is a lot of  posturing i would say because both sides
RAiQNQCISbA,1060720,1066720,do not have a ready-made way forward so  you can see that you know both the
RAiQNQCISbA,1066720,1074160,official cena as well as the rebel cena  are giving out statements or sending  across messages to their own supporters
RAiQNQCISbA,1074160,1080640,that they are  in a firm of their line of approach but  the whole problem here is things are not
RAiQNQCISbA,1080640,1087440,exactly moving forward because for those  agreed to take action on his mlas would  also reduce the number of
RAiQNQCISbA,1087440,1094000,mla exactly and other things the whole  thing has to be decided by the chair  chad in this case is a deputy speaker
RAiQNQCISbA,1094000,1099440,because maharashtra simply doesn't have  a full-fledged speaker so there are a  lot of procedures to go through before
RAiQNQCISbA,1099440,1105600,you actually act against mlas that is  little far off i think what is happening  right now is each side is seeing what
RAiQNQCISbA,1105600,1110799,can best be done to appear to be very  tough bring pressure on the opposite  side and
RAiQNQCISbA,1110799,1118400,and also what you mentioned about ajit  pawar you know holding his own meeting  because he may not be sharing his uncle
RAiQNQCISbA,1118400,1124960,you know in case the government  collapses he would sit in the opposition  i think power i'm sure would be looking  at the alternatives before him you
RAiQNQCISbA,1124960,1132240,mentioned about what happened in 2019  because nobody at this  juncture would like to stay out of power
RAiQNQCISbA,1132240,1137760,therefore you can see a lot of  permutation combination okay i'm not  sure whether bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,1137760,1142960,uh is going to you know do anything  immediately because they are once bitter
RAiQNQCISbA,1142960,1148400,twice shy because what happened in 2019  we know very well that early morning
RAiQNQCISbA,1148400,1155039,swearing in and subsequent the drama  that happened so this time they are very  cautious i find everybody is caught in a
RAiQNQCISbA,1155039,1161600,jam with actually no forward movement  happening each one trying to appear that  you know they are firm they are doing
RAiQNQCISbA,1161600,1168640,all kinds of posturing  so this is posturing from both sides but  the big suspense still remains and
RAiQNQCISbA,1168640,1174720,arunia i'm sure you've got a hundred  people asking you this question but i'll  ask you anyway go to the taco design
RAiQNQCISbA,1174720,1177720,today
RAiQNQCISbA,1180559,1186240,all right so i have to interrupt you  we've got the senior jurors mr mukhel  with us sir looking at the legal
RAiQNQCISbA,1186240,1193440,situation in maharashtra right now do  you think with 34 mlas with aknac shinde
RAiQNQCISbA,1193440,1199520,uddhav thakrei has ceased to enjoy the  status of being the head of the real
RAiQNQCISbA,1199520,1206320,ship cena  look there is no doubt  that the government has lost the
RAiQNQCISbA,1206320,1213039,confidence of the house  the government is not in a majority  it is in a minority
RAiQNQCISbA,1213039,1219280,therefore the next step is  that the speaker should be asked to  summon the house
RAiQNQCISbA,1219280,1225280,which should have only one agenda  namely whether  the government enjoys the confidence of
RAiQNQCISbA,1225280,1232960,the house  so ultimately  the litmus test  is conducted on the floor of the house
RAiQNQCISbA,1232960,1238720,on the floor of the house if out of 287  people who attend mla is what end
RAiQNQCISbA,1238720,1244640,if the government can muster a majority  of more than 50  it can legitimately claim to be in power
RAiQNQCISbA,1244640,1251520,but if it does not have more than 50  percent of 287  then certainly it loses its majority and
RAiQNQCISbA,1251520,1258000,it has to go  now  if i can just interrupt you for a second  maharashtra does not have a speaker at
RAiQNQCISbA,1258000,1264559,present so who will appoint the speaker  which which faction or which party will  appoint it no no it doesn't make a
RAiQNQCISbA,1264559,1270720,difference whether there is a speaker  and if there is no speaker then you have  a deputy speaker
RAiQNQCISbA,1270720,1276000,who will  uh  you know conduct the flow test and if if
RAiQNQCISbA,1276000,1281760,there is a situation that there is no  deputy speaker then a pro-time speaker
RAiQNQCISbA,1281760,1289520,that is a temporary speaker is appointed  by the house who is usually one of the  senior most mlas but in our case we have
RAiQNQCISbA,1289520,1295840,a deputy speaker so the deputy speaker  must summon the house must have an  agenda as to whether the government
RAiQNQCISbA,1295840,1300960,commands majority and on that a voting  must take place only on the floor of the
RAiQNQCISbA,1300960,1306400,house there can be no voting  anywhere else including the governor's
RAiQNQCISbA,1306400,1313440,residence it must happen only on the  floor of the house that will determine  whether they have 50
RAiQNQCISbA,1313440,1319600,or not if not they must go and then the  the governor must invite
RAiQNQCISbA,1319600,1326080,the the  uh  opposite claimant group to form  government give them time when he sees
RAiQNQCISbA,1326080,1331440,prima facie that they have more than 50  percent  that is the next step but sir before the
RAiQNQCISbA,1331440,1337280,voting takes place the rebel faction has  to show that they are a separate party
RAiQNQCISbA,1337280,1342799,but without the number of 37 want to  immediately invite the people so as i
RAiQNQCISbA,1342799,1349440,told you  as i told you  the first step is  whether there is majority or not of the
RAiQNQCISbA,1349440,1356400,ruling party  the second step is if they do not then  the party who claims to have a majority
RAiQNQCISbA,1356400,1361440,or a group who claims to have a majority  must be given a chance to form
RAiQNQCISbA,1361440,1367200,government  the third step is that if government is  formed
RAiQNQCISbA,1367200,1374400,with less than two thirds  of the shift sena who break away  then the issue of anti-defection will
RAiQNQCISbA,1374400,1380400,arise  when issue of anti-defection arises then  the speaker will have to call them give
RAiQNQCISbA,1380400,1386159,them a hearing and pass a ruling but  that is a later step and the last step
RAiQNQCISbA,1386159,1392320,would be  the election commission would decide who  will have the right of a symbol that is
RAiQNQCISbA,1392320,1398159,how this is a structured position first  position vote of confidence government
RAiQNQCISbA,1398159,1404159,or no government  second defection or anti-defection third
RAiQNQCISbA,1404159,1409600,if there's an issue of a symbol that  will be decided by the ec that's how it  goes
RAiQNQCISbA,1409600,1415280,so if the does not quit today the bjp  cannot move a no confidence motion  against him
RAiQNQCISbA,1415280,1422559,obviously moving no confidence wherein  the speaker will be obliged to summon  the house and have a vote of confidence
RAiQNQCISbA,1422559,1428720,on the floor of the house the supreme  court has repeatedly said  that whether government has majority or
RAiQNQCISbA,1428720,1436400,loses majority can be tested only and  only on the floor of the house  not while parading members before the
RAiQNQCISbA,1436400,1442799,governor or any other authority  therefore  you call the idea is that if the bjp was
RAiQNQCISbA,1442799,1448559,to give a list of persons who are now  voting with the bjp belonging to shiv
RAiQNQCISbA,1448559,1455360,sena or arsenal members of the of the  governing party then obviously
RAiQNQCISbA,1455360,1461600,he will call the speaker will or the  deputy speaker will call  the house and put the motion to vote
RAiQNQCISbA,1461600,1467520,it's a very simple vote  either you have 50 percent of 287 or you  don't have so is there a time frame
RAiQNQCISbA,1467520,1473679,within which  has to prove that he has the confidence  of the house  well well there is no time frame
RAiQNQCISbA,1473679,1479840,provided by the constitution but since  the matter is of utmost constitutional  importance
RAiQNQCISbA,1479840,1487200,and  may may involve the fall of a government  you need a government to be in place
RAiQNQCISbA,1487200,1493600,to run the state in accordance with the  constitutional principles the governor  must do it asap
RAiQNQCISbA,1493600,1501120,asap does not mean morning or evening it  can certainly mean in the next couple of  days that should happen unfortunately we
RAiQNQCISbA,1501120,1508000,have seen cases where it has not  happened when i was a councillor council  in the supreme court for the bangalore
RAiQNQCISbA,1508000,1513120,karnataka issue if you remember two  three years ago the governor was the
RAiQNQCISbA,1513120,1518799,the speaker was ducking the issue we  have to move the court etc so i hope
RAiQNQCISbA,1518799,1525360,such an ugly situation does not happen i  hope nobody has to move the court and  the constitutional
RAiQNQCISbA,1525360,1530720,the principles must be followed the  governor is a very high ranking
RAiQNQCISbA,1530720,1538960,authority in the constitution supposed  to be unbiased even though he may belong  to one party his job is to ensure that
RAiQNQCISbA,1538960,1545120,the  government is run in accordance with the  constitution
RAiQNQCISbA,1545360,1550880,one final question to you today a whip  was issued by the shiv sena to the rebel
RAiQNQCISbA,1550880,1558080,mla saying either present yourself by 5  pm or you will stand disqualified from  the party can they issue a whip like
RAiQNQCISbA,1558080,1565039,this and do the mlas by virtue of not  turning up at five stand automatically  disqualified
RAiQNQCISbA,1565039,1570880,there is no question of disqualification  if they if they don't obey the whip they  can
RAiQNQCISbA,1570880,1576400,tell the speaker that we form a separate  group  and therefore as i told you
RAiQNQCISbA,1576400,1582400,the ultimate thing is  the vote of confidence in the floor of  the house calling the vapor not calling
RAiQNQCISbA,1582400,1589039,a deep in the internal party  issue it is not on the floor of the  house so whether they call or they don't
RAiQNQCISbA,1589039,1595120,call the only test is the speaker to  summon the house okay finally if mr
RAiQNQCISbA,1595120,1602640,thakuray today quits  he offers his resignation what is the  most obvious next step
RAiQNQCISbA,1602640,1607760,obviously the people who break away and  join another group who claim to have
RAiQNQCISbA,1607760,1613919,more than 50 percent will stake a claim  before the governor and the governor  will prime effectively have a look at
RAiQNQCISbA,1613919,1620880,the numbers they have and then he will  ask a house to be summoned and then the  vote of conflict i mean the party who
RAiQNQCISbA,1620880,1627520,claims will have to prove a vote of  confidence because the government would  have gone on designation that's it that
RAiQNQCISbA,1627520,1633279,can happen in a couple of days all right  mr mukherjee really appreciate you uh  having laid out all the facts there very
RAiQNQCISbA,1633279,1638399,lucidly and helping us understand thank  you very much in the meantime many many  developments have taken place other
RAiQNQCISbA,1638399,1645840,thing we are learning has been on the  phone he's been dialing numbers he's  trying to reach out to rebel mlas bring
RAiQNQCISbA,1645840,1651640,us up to speed on who he called our  o'neill and what was said
RAiQNQCISbA,1657520,1662799,basically this can be seen as the last  emotional appeal by c buddha and his
RAiQNQCISbA,1662799,1670799,people for to the rebel mlas to come  back to see him with that race fold come  back to the original ship sena as they
RAiQNQCISbA,1670799,1677120,want to call it however it seems like  till now there has been no proper  communication that has been made with
RAiQNQCISbA,1677120,1683679,these rebel mls in fact the close party  members party workers are close  supporters of these rebel mlas have also
RAiQNQCISbA,1683679,1688960,been reached out by uh the ships and as  high command or adi tata craze men the
RAiQNQCISbA,1688960,1694559,uh to convince them to tell them to  convince the rebel mls to come back to
RAiQNQCISbA,1694559,1701760,the original september as what they have  been saying one more important  development  is that by 7 pm today
RAiQNQCISbA,1701760,1707760,they will be addressing a press  conference in guwahati that is that will  also be extremely uh important but that
RAiQNQCISbA,1707760,1713600,will happen after cm  addresses uh the people of india via his
RAiQNQCISbA,1713600,1719360,social media post and what exactly he  says  if all eyes are on it yes it is around
RAiQNQCISbA,1719360,1724720,15 to 20 minutes late now what is the  exact reason uh that we will be able to
RAiQNQCISbA,1724720,1731520,find out in some time but why this delay  is happening uh probably because uh they  are still working out on the technical
RAiQNQCISbA,1731520,1738080,several technicalities with respect to  how they can stack these rebel mlas or  what are the other permutations and
RAiQNQCISbA,1738080,1743440,combinations that can be worked out  all right last ditch efforts some
RAiQNQCISbA,1743440,1750880,permutations and combinations being  worked out says our neil phone calls are  being made to the rebels
RAiQNQCISbA,1750880,1757279,do you think uddhav takri can still hang  on  uh i don't think so takray has a chance
RAiQNQCISbA,1757279,1763679,the only chance is that if  he decides to align with the bjp to farm  the government because 34 mla is a
RAiQNQCISbA,1763679,1769039,pretty big number  though under anti-defection law these 34  mlas if they vote on the floor of the
RAiQNQCISbA,1769039,1775200,house against the whip of the government  that is by the taker government then  they stand to disqualify
RAiQNQCISbA,1775200,1780480,but  in that scenario  the the government
RAiQNQCISbA,1780480,1786399,uh will be voted out  and along with them the mlas would
RAiQNQCISbA,1786399,1792240,define the whip they will also lose the  membership  so in that in that in that case i think
RAiQNQCISbA,1792240,1797679,that pakre has to choose my gut feeling  is that the sooner or later
RAiQNQCISbA,1797679,1805200,government would would like to have some  kind of understanding with eight nation  day and if they could have a kind of
RAiQNQCISbA,1805200,1811600,some understanding with him because if  losing 34 mlas  which i still doubt uh because it might
RAiQNQCISbA,1811600,1818960,go to 37.38 okay that  then in the legislative in in in the  assembly uh the
RAiQNQCISbA,1818960,1823039,group will be recognized and the real  should say now
RAiQNQCISbA,1831360,1838080,and all the 15 mlas who were stationed  here have left for varsha for that  particular meeting so there is a
RAiQNQCISbA,1838080,1844399,likelihood it would be post that meeting  that ut  address or it could be before the  meeting that udav takri will make that
RAiQNQCISbA,1844399,1849440,address but uh because there had been an  ultimatum issued to the other mlas of
RAiQNQCISbA,1849440,1854559,course there was a meeting called in uh  of all the cena mlas and as a result of
RAiQNQCISbA,1854559,1862080,that these 15 mlas who are part of the  sacred camp have left for russia for  that a crucial meeting of the mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,1862080,1868240,however despite ultimatum being sent to  those around 40 mla 35 to 40 mlas with
RAiQNQCISbA,1868240,1873519,ignacinda of course they did give out  that resolution letter in which their
RAiQNQCISbA,1873519,1880399,discontent their dissatisfaction with  the cena was made very clear which means  obviously they won't be attending it and
RAiQNQCISbA,1880399,1886880,now we are waiting for dev takrez's  emotional appeal to the public whether  he will uh put out the resignation
RAiQNQCISbA,1886880,1895440,remains to be seen interesting because a  lot can be engaged a lot can be gauged  from the kind of reaction that the mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,1895440,1902159,would have given or what their general  demeanor was when they left for varsha  that perhaps could give us an indication
RAiQNQCISbA,1902159,1907840,of what we are likely to hear from  uddhav so what was the demeanor like  radhika
RAiQNQCISbA,1907840,1915360,the million dollar question of the body  language  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,1915360,1921360,all right i don't think we can get  through to radhika just as yet uh we'll  try and establish contact again but the
RAiQNQCISbA,1921360,1926960,big news coming in right now is that  devendra fadnavis is also likely to  speak in a while not shinde is going to
RAiQNQCISbA,1926960,1934080,speak in guwahati at 7 00 pm these are  going to be very very fast-paced  developments if there is one thing
RAiQNQCISbA,1934080,1939279,shaykh that seems to be quite clear by  now is that the ncb and the congress
RAiQNQCISbA,1939279,1945679,have decided since yesterday  this is the shiv sena's battle to fight
RAiQNQCISbA,1945679,1952399,our flock is together congress today  morning said we have our 44 sharat pawar  yesterday said we had no cross voting
RAiQNQCISbA,1952399,1958799,now you deal with your own demons do you  agree  indeed
RAiQNQCISbA,1958799,1963840,the purpose of kabala's visit to mumbai  was also to ensure that there is no
RAiQNQCISbA,1963840,1969039,deception from the congress stamp and uh  naturally shark power has realized that
RAiQNQCISbA,1969039,1975440,this is  too much of an implosion in cena in  which he can you know try to as isolate
RAiQNQCISbA,1975440,1981279,the feelings because if you recall even  in 2019 uh the question of making aditya
RAiQNQCISbA,1981279,1986399,that chimpanzee had come up at that time  and uday was very keen that aditya
RAiQNQCISbA,1986399,1993279,takari should become cm at that very  juncture when this coalition idea was  muted but it was sanat who prevailed and
RAiQNQCISbA,1993279,1998880,persuaded without that  there would be difficulty in accepting
RAiQNQCISbA,1998880,2004559,as a political domain okay and finally  took charge so you can see you know
RAiQNQCISbA,2004559,2010880,whatever firefighting had to be done it  was done then and subsequently also  i believe trying to convey to the
RAiQNQCISbA,2010880,2016840,factory that there are problems with  this style of functioning there are  problems in terms of access of the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,2016840,2023919,minister okay with the mlas and not just  with china the problem was there with  among mcp ministers ncp legislators as
RAiQNQCISbA,2023919,2029679,well as congress ministers you know it's  a it's a scenario where none of the  partners were very happy with the way
RAiQNQCISbA,2029679,2035039,things were functioning  are not happy with the way things are  functioning shifts enacts are not happy
RAiQNQCISbA,2035039,2041279,with the way that the partners are  trying to muscle in on their ministries  on their constituencies on their
RAiQNQCISbA,2041279,2047919,municipalities also we are learning now  member of parliament bhavna gavli has  written a letter to uddhav takri if you
RAiQNQCISbA,2047919,2055839,can quickly take us through arunil what  it is that bhavna gavli has said  apparently she has told uddhav requested
RAiQNQCISbA,2055839,2060919,to take a big decision quote unquote
RAiQNQCISbA,2064000,2070960,well this is the letter that bhavna  gavli had written to has written to cm  it is in marathi basically
RAiQNQCISbA,2070960,2074960,if we can read through our letter she's  saying
RAiQNQCISbA,2082240,2087679,you have been emotionally disturbed  with the kind of political proceedings  that have happened in the state of
RAiQNQCISbA,2087679,2094079,maharashtra  and this is a big challenge in front of
RAiQNQCISbA,2094079,2102960,you and i request you to take a very big  decision  for say now what that big decision will  be that only bhavna kali
RAiQNQCISbA,2104400,2111359,but if we look at the indications the  ship sena mlas who were staying at the  nearby st regis hotel it is around 20 to
RAiQNQCISbA,2111359,2116720,25 minutes from siem udo takrez varchar  residence if they come over here then
RAiQNQCISbA,2116720,2122079,obviously the ship says  is following the protocol which was set
RAiQNQCISbA,2122079,2127119,by sunil prabhu just uh the close  confident of  udot
RAiQNQCISbA,2127119,2133200,what basically sent out a letter to all  the ships in our mlas including the  rebel mlas basically telling them that
RAiQNQCISbA,2133200,2140240,by 5 pm you have to be your  at workshop communicate with the  hierarchy basically cm without ray and
RAiQNQCISbA,2140240,2146640,his close confidence and if you don't  follow that protocol then then you tend  to lose your interesting though
RAiQNQCISbA,2146640,2153119,considering that  is such a senior member of parliament of  the shiv cena a five-time mp somebody
RAiQNQCISbA,2153119,2159520,who is one of the senior most mps from  maharashtra all together the the  language seems to suggest
RAiQNQCISbA,2159520,2165599,that almost she is mirroring what shinde  camp is saying that take a decision in
RAiQNQCISbA,2165599,2172119,the interest of hindu take a big  decision etc would you would you say so
RAiQNQCISbA,2174079,2180960,well well that is what in the second  paragraph he is writing about it that  for the sake of hindu why our mlas have
RAiQNQCISbA,2180960,2186000,gone away from us is because they  believe in hinduism
RAiQNQCISbA,2186000,2191359,deserted hindu so i request you not to  take any punitive measures against
RAiQNQCISbA,2191359,2196560,these mlas who have left us in fact used  i request you to that you should adhere
RAiQNQCISbA,2196560,2203040,to their demands accept their demands  and change our pakistan almost as if  there is a sort of emotional pressure
RAiQNQCISbA,2203040,2208640,being built upon  this whole  issue of hindutva being revived again
RAiQNQCISbA,2208640,2213920,and again it was first raised by the  shinde camp now other mps members of the
RAiQNQCISbA,2213920,2221520,ship say now also saying similar things  radhika i believe is back with us when  they left the hotel for varsha
RAiQNQCISbA,2221520,2227920,what was the mood like radhika  um in the ship say nakam the original  ship saying as it
RAiQNQCISbA,2227920,2233839,as far as these legislators are  concerned as far as these mlas who are  part of the
RAiQNQCISbA,2233839,2238960,camp are concerned they are saying that  they have the numbers of course they do  not know what the numbers they are
RAiQNQCISbA,2238960,2246079,talking about of course there were  different versions that were coming out  that there are 15 of us there are 17 of  us there there are 22 offers they they
RAiQNQCISbA,2246079,2251680,themselves are not  entirely certain of the numbers they  have in undertaker's favor but they were
RAiQNQCISbA,2251680,2259280,seeming confident they said that they  will be going for this meeting they will  be attending the meeting they are um
RAiQNQCISbA,2259280,2264880,loyalists and nothing can break this  particular alliance nothing can break  this particular government so that was
RAiQNQCISbA,2264880,2270160,the mood of these staunch uddhav  supporters
RAiQNQCISbA,2270240,2277040,mlas who were at saint francis have gone  to russia where they will be attending  that particular meeting unfortunately
RAiQNQCISbA,2277040,2283119,though that meeting will only be  attended by  that many mlas uh you know 30 odd mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,2283119,2289359,are still in gohati who have of course  so if we were to just zero in on the  number of people who are still with
RAiQNQCISbA,2289359,2299839,uddhav and since they left from the  hotel it's safe to say they are anywhere  in the vicinity of 15 maximum 20 radhika
RAiQNQCISbA,2301359,2307119,yes absolutely anywhere between 15 to 20  not more than that is is the is is what
RAiQNQCISbA,2307119,2313040,we have assessed from what we saw even  yesterday when they were entering and  today when they were exiting what we
RAiQNQCISbA,2313040,2318480,could gather is that it is not more than  20. so it is anywhere between 15 and 20
RAiQNQCISbA,2318480,2323599,we saw about perhaps about  12 to 15 of them so yes so that's the
RAiQNQCISbA,2323599,2329920,number that we can look at not more than  20 so easily uh uh okay so we have more
RAiQNQCISbA,2329920,2335760,cars actually exiting at this particular  place uh but these are not off uh
RAiQNQCISbA,2335760,2341440,all right so the the there are more cars  that are exiting uh from this particular  place we will try and we will try and
RAiQNQCISbA,2341440,2346480,fix it  all right so so yes so mlas are still
RAiQNQCISbA,2346480,2352960,exiting uh from saint riges uh we saw a  few of them who had exited some time
RAiQNQCISbA,2352960,2359040,back now more number of them are exiting  towards russia so that is you've been
RAiQNQCISbA,2359040,2364640,speaking to them  you've been speaking to them what  exactly are they saying
RAiQNQCISbA,2364640,2371040,what are they headed towards are they  headed to a government that still exists  or are they headed towards the  resignation are they headed towards
RAiQNQCISbA,2371040,2377280,president's rule what exactly is their  mood right now
RAiQNQCISbA,2378160,2383200,you know as far as these mlas are  concerned  they'd like to believe that they are
RAiQNQCISbA,2383200,2389359,going to survive they'd like to believe  that the government exists that's that's  the kind of sense that we got that they
RAiQNQCISbA,2389359,2395200,are not entirely certain about the  numbers they say that you know we have  the letter in hand with several
RAiQNQCISbA,2395200,2400320,signatures uh you know obviously that  doesn't prove the majority we are
RAiQNQCISbA,2400320,2406160,talking about just about 15 to  20 of them yet somehow we even without
RAiQNQCISbA,2406160,2411680,numbers they are seeming very confident  so clearly they do not want to  you know
RAiQNQCISbA,2411680,2418000,express their defeat  as yet that's the sense we got from them  that they do not want to express their
RAiQNQCISbA,2418000,2423920,defeat as yet they want to go and sit  for that meeting and try and understand  what the plan of action is and what the
RAiQNQCISbA,2423920,2430720,strategy is all right the plan of action  and the strategy would be very very  interesting it's maybe a little  premature to ask this question but many
RAiQNQCISbA,2430720,2435760,are left wondering if the breakaway  group ashitosh is
RAiQNQCISbA,2435760,2441440,taking the plank of hindutva being  betrayed  post this rebellion
RAiQNQCISbA,2441440,2445440,what will happen to the ship senna the  shiv
RAiQNQCISbA,2450839,2456720,senator i i think you're muted sir  see uh i think this is not the first
RAiQNQCISbA,2456720,2463119,time that the sri cena has seen a  vertical split in the party itself if  you remember when chicken  when balasa pakri was there in 1991
RAiQNQCISbA,2463119,2469760,chicken with walked away with the 17  mlas  and then uh narayan rane and raj takarai
RAiQNQCISbA,2469760,2476240,and the gunners like so this is not the  first end the point is that the shu sena  is recognized by the takari family and
RAiQNQCISbA,2476240,2481039,it's only takre family  which will be given
RAiQNQCISbA,2534240,2537240,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,2562240,2564880,i had no
RAiQNQCISbA,2577599,2579839,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,2602480,2605480,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,2659280,2665440,i  the two underwent  months that followed my surgery i was  not in a condition to meet anyone or
RAiQNQCISbA,2665440,2669760,speak to anyone so i could not dispel  that narrative
RAiQNQCISbA,2671839,2674240,meeting
RAiQNQCISbA,2782480,2788359,those who became ministers were also  part of the senate
RAiQNQCISbA,2808640,2815040,i request all those people who are  talking about this not being the  party that left behind
RAiQNQCISbA,2815040,2821200,that all of what they have achieved in  the last couple of years is also given  by the same party
RAiQNQCISbA,2821200,2824920,and was given to them
RAiQNQCISbA,2834880,2840119,they want to come back but i don't want  to get into those specifics
RAiQNQCISbA,2856640,2859640,elections
RAiQNQCISbA,2865040,2869800,why are we holding them up in one place
RAiQNQCISbA,2954319,2957319,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,2981359,2984359,is
RAiQNQCISbA,3011599,3013839,to
RAiQNQCISbA,3052960,3058079,most today is that if the ncp or the  congress would have said that they do  not want me to leave the state then it
RAiQNQCISbA,3058079,3061119,would have been understandable
RAiQNQCISbA,3066640,3069640,but
RAiQNQCISbA,3104640,3107799,which is
RAiQNQCISbA,3177920,3185840,foreign  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,3219520,3222520,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3247359,3250960,have a conversation with me you want me
RAiQNQCISbA,3269119,3272119,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3313280,3316280,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3343359,3348599,of leading the party then i'm ready to  give up that position
RAiQNQCISbA,3410480,3413480,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3422319,3427680,what you do when you're in a position of  power is what decides your legacy and in  the last two and a half years i think i
RAiQNQCISbA,3427680,3431960,have given the state and the party that
RAiQNQCISbA,3486839,3493599,is it's a democracy it is a number game  but how have you come up with those  numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,3493599,3498640,have you gotten those numbers out of  people's free will and because they want  to be with you or have you forced them
RAiQNQCISbA,3498640,3503318,is what is needed to be looked at
RAiQNQCISbA,3511359,3514359,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3528240,3531119,that you do not
RAiQNQCISbA,3535200,3538200,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3550400,3555839,i do not care about the chief minister's  chair but the love of the people the  confidence in people is what i care
RAiQNQCISbA,3555839,3560880,about even if i'm not the chief minister  if you continue to have that confidence  and love for me then that's all that i
RAiQNQCISbA,3560880,3563119,wanted
RAiQNQCISbA,3569599,3576440,to protect  foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3587280,3592640,well we're going to try and cut back to  that press conference that
RAiQNQCISbA,3592640,3600319,addressed to the state that has been  telegraphed uh by uddhav takri over  facebook viewers but he's quite clear
RAiQNQCISbA,3600319,3608559,that as of now there's no question of  him quitting unless and until of course  the dissenting rebel mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,3608559,3614880,come up to him  stand in front of him and tell him on  his face that they don't want him as the
RAiQNQCISbA,3614880,3622240,chief minister or the chief of the shiv  sena once he hears it  from their mouths in person he will go
RAiQNQCISbA,3622240,3627599,because he doesn't love power he's also  sent out a message direct message to all
RAiQNQCISbA,3627599,3632880,the carder  including the rebels that as far as he's  concerned
RAiQNQCISbA,3632880,3637920,the shift cena has not strayed  from hindutva
RAiQNQCISbA,3637920,3643359,hindutva is the ideology  as well as the beating heart
RAiQNQCISbA,3643359,3649520,of  the shift cena let's try and go back  to that address and pick up
RAiQNQCISbA,3649520,3656480,okay we don't quite we don't quite have  that feed uh let me go straight across  to aruni now on the ground aruni
RAiQNQCISbA,3656480,3663119,quite expected many people had thought  that  uddhav takre would actually
RAiQNQCISbA,3663119,3668240,call the bluff he had made his intention  clear by issuing a statement saying that
RAiQNQCISbA,3668240,3675280,if the rebel mlas don't show up at the  meeting that he has called at his  residence they will be sacked so he's
RAiQNQCISbA,3675280,3680799,been consistent there  as of now not quitting
RAiQNQCISbA,3694960,3702000,is with us right now mr samantha i want  to come straight out to you thank you  for speaking to times now
RAiQNQCISbA,3702000,3708319,mr udav taker is saying that i'm ready  to quit  but only if the rebels come and tell me
RAiQNQCISbA,3708319,3714799,to my face  that they don't want me to continue that  means you don't have the numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,3714799,3720880,it's not the question of number try to  understand again again  it is not because he stated in the view
RAiQNQCISbA,3720880,3727599,of that while addressing that  i am not wondering about the number of  other things issue is that the
RAiQNQCISbA,3727599,3734960,opposition other parties which are in  alliance are saying we believe in you  and we trust you and our own people
RAiQNQCISbA,3734960,3741318,he has used the marathi  slogan for that you know foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,3741440,3747599,[Music]  of the same tree
RAiQNQCISbA,3747599,3752799,of the same tree and that actually is  applied on the safety that is what he is  saying
RAiQNQCISbA,3752799,3758559,who are these people let them come  forward and tell me that we don't want  you to be a leader
RAiQNQCISbA,3758559,3764799,mr shindey has said that he's going to  be holding a press conference very  shortly what if he says that you heard
RAiQNQCISbA,3764799,3770880,our message we're not interested in  coming to meet you face to face
RAiQNQCISbA,3770880,3778400,you have to accept the reality what  happens then  that is that is the reason that is the  issue now if you are really
RAiQNQCISbA,3778400,3783920,by heart that you don't want that  leadership we should have a courage to  come and tell him that we don't want to
RAiQNQCISbA,3783920,3790319,follow you they should show the courage  instead of going away running i mean  staying here staying at goatee that's
RAiQNQCISbA,3790319,3796720,what he said why you ran away for so  long when mr said that he made desperate  attempts to contact and raise issues
RAiQNQCISbA,3796720,3802400,with the shift cena  at the top level but he was not hurt  therefore he had to do what he had to do
RAiQNQCISbA,3802400,3808319,you know his response never ever this  cannot be he's openly speaking
RAiQNQCISbA,3808319,3814160,what would you want so transparent  and it was really disheartening to  listen to that
RAiQNQCISbA,3814160,3820240,that such a thorough gentleman  said they were god but the generation of  the maharashtra is being
RAiQNQCISbA,3820240,3828240,treated like this our own people not the  fathers  not the opposition  that is why he's heard for that
RAiQNQCISbA,3828240,3834000,but supposing  they say no we are not coming will you  expel them that's the fundamental
RAiQNQCISbA,3834000,3840319,question how long will you give them  okay we've lost arvind saban there
RAiQNQCISbA,3840319,3847280,let me go back once again to aruni  laruni sanjay rawat has come out and  tweeted saying that
RAiQNQCISbA,3847280,3853039,yes  we'll continue to struggle  our struggle will continue
RAiQNQCISbA,3853039,3856480,how do you interpret this aruni
RAiQNQCISbA,3859119,3864160,well sanjay rao's tweet says  that means our struggle will
RAiQNQCISbA,3864160,3870559,go on now this is again contradictory  with the uh press conference or the  interaction social media interaction
RAiQNQCISbA,3870559,3877280,that  is there that aggression could not be
RAiQNQCISbA,3877280,3882559,seen be what everybody was expecting was  that according to the letter that sunil
RAiQNQCISbA,3882559,3889280,prabhu had sent in to the ships mla  saying that if by 5 pm they don't  communicate uh with the cena hierarchy
RAiQNQCISbA,3889280,3896960,with cmudot then they will they have a  chance of losing their mla post as well  but here it was an emotional appeal that
RAiQNQCISbA,3896960,3903680,uh  uh he hinted towards he in fact he made  an emotional appeal to the ekna shinde
RAiQNQCISbA,3903680,3909280,camp basically saying that you should  watch you have watched my facebook  interaction you have watched my social
RAiQNQCISbA,3909280,3916160,media interaction now you should call me  or my people and tell me tell me on my  face come over here at my bungalow and
RAiQNQCISbA,3916160,3923039,tell me that i'm not good i'm not good  enough i'm not incapable i'm incapable  in handling the cm post then i will make
RAiQNQCISbA,3923039,3928240,i will be happy that somebody else from  the shift cena takes over the cm post
RAiQNQCISbA,3928240,3933520,on that front but clearly what was  expected as per the letter that
RAiQNQCISbA,3933520,3938720,had made his close confidence ascend to  the rebel mlas uh his entire stance was
RAiQNQCISbA,3938720,3944960,completely different it was it was  rather emotional one can say emotional  appeals being made to the shifts and
RAiQNQCISbA,3944960,3950559,next emotional appeal being made to  these rebelling mls and that also  showcases that he doesn't have the
RAiQNQCISbA,3950559,3956160,numbers because  he clearly views the ball very clearly  let me just break this down for you  there are four scenarios that are
RAiQNQCISbA,3956160,3962799,unfolding sharing is also joining us on  this broadcast we're also going to  connect to guwahati because the ball  right now viewers is very firmly now in
RAiQNQCISbA,3962799,3968079,the shinde camps court  shinde  and his
RAiQNQCISbA,3968079,3975039,32 or 34 mlas  as he claims  give one or two
RAiQNQCISbA,3975039,3982799,now we'll have to respond  shortly to davtakari we've already been  told that at 7 pm shinde the rebel is
RAiQNQCISbA,3982799,3988880,going to actually be holding a press  conference what he says  one doesn't know but one can hazard a
RAiQNQCISbA,3988880,3995119,guess he might turn on and say that look  i have been sending messages to you  about the fact that you are energying on
RAiQNQCISbA,3995119,4001039,your commitment to hindutva but you  haven't paid me any attention today i've  decided now
RAiQNQCISbA,4001039,4007440,to pursue the own course  my own course my own path to save  hindutva to save
RAiQNQCISbA,4007440,4012960,to shave this to save the shiv senna  as it is straying from the path of hindu
RAiQNQCISbA,4012960,4019680,and therefore  i will continue  my struggle  to ensure that balasai takaray's legacy
RAiQNQCISbA,4019680,4024880,is not squandered by his heirs  and he may refuse viewers
RAiQNQCISbA,4024880,4030799,to meet  uddhav takre in person if that happens  the question then of course is will
RAiQNQCISbA,4030799,4036160,uddhav takre escalate matters by issuing  expulsion orders
RAiQNQCISbA,4036160,4042160,now if he does so viewers that will  trigger some sort of a constitutional  crisis because
RAiQNQCISbA,4042160,4049520,fundamentally these people will stand to  be disqualified the speaker remains  loyal to the shiv sena he might convene
RAiQNQCISbA,4049520,4054880,the house and of course take note of the  expulsions the halfway mark of the house
RAiQNQCISbA,4054880,4060319,will come down  and it is quite possible that the shiv  cena might be
RAiQNQCISbA,4060319,4067520,one or two short of the halfway mark or  might just be  placed with a wafer thin majority
RAiQNQCISbA,4067520,4074319,will uddhav takaray take that chance  will shinday stand up to the  or will he say okay let's have it out
RAiQNQCISbA,4074319,4080960,face to face i remain a committed chief  cynic i think we can work together to  resurrect balthakray's legacy and we can
RAiQNQCISbA,4080960,4086160,continue this conversation elsewhere  that would mean a temporary halt to
RAiQNQCISbA,4086160,4092880,these hostilities between the two camps  those are the scenarios that are  evolving the three main takeaways from
RAiQNQCISbA,4092880,4098000,the uh udav tag ray press conference  he's not quitting he's defended
RAiQNQCISbA,4098000,4105278,very very stoutly his commitment to  hindutva and he has come out and very  clearly put the ball in the shinde camp
RAiQNQCISbA,4105278,4111838,saying that if you are true  courageous shifts anniks if you're all  tigers you will come stand in front of
RAiQNQCISbA,4111838,4117920,me  with the gumption of telling me what you  think to my face and we will have it out
RAiQNQCISbA,4117920,4123679,and if i feel that you are right i will  quit  that's the gauntlet that has been thrown
RAiQNQCISbA,4123679,4129679,down let's open this up because we have  our reporters all across uh i want to go  straight across first to nibiru who's in
RAiQNQCISbA,4129679,4135278,guwahati nibir this is going to be an  interesting conversation arun nil is  there also in the frame we also have
RAiQNQCISbA,4135278,4142560,radhika who's also making her way now to  uh the  house of mr dwayne the father because at
RAiQNQCISbA,4142560,4147679,the end of the day if the bjp doesn't  stand behind the shinde camp then
RAiQNQCISbA,4147679,4155120,this entire mutiny will have come to no  avail also with us sharing  let me first come out to you nibir nibir
RAiQNQCISbA,4155120,4160480,where is mr shinde right now where are  the mlas right now and what are they
RAiQNQCISbA,4160480,4163600,expected to do next
RAiQNQCISbA,4167278,4174159,the dissenting mlas here are launched at  the redison blue hotel here in guwahati  since morning they landed in guwahati
RAiQNQCISbA,4174159,4180640,airport and straight away came to the  radisson blue hotel and very important  questions that are going to be answered
RAiQNQCISbA,4180640,4187120,in the media briefing that shinde is  going to be held within our because  there are questions firstly about the
RAiQNQCISbA,4187120,4193278,decision whether he wants to stay or  whether he wants to move away whether he  wants to follow his own ideals that he
RAiQNQCISbA,4193278,4198320,has said that he is going to follow late  by allah's hindu ideals secondly there
RAiQNQCISbA,4198320,4204800,is also the question of the bjp  footprint that was visible today because  we saw the bcp grass root workers at the
RAiQNQCISbA,4204800,4211600,airport we also saw a few of the bjp  leaders addressing the dissenting mlas  at the airport and also their entry at
RAiQNQCISbA,4211600,4217360,the hotel so these are the key questions  that are going to be answered by shinden  also his decision whether he wants to
RAiQNQCISbA,4217360,4223920,continue descent or whether he wants to  rethink about his decision so big  questions are going to be answered today
RAiQNQCISbA,4223920,4230239,at the media interaction that it has  been done by shinde and his camp that  has now been camping here at the
RAiQNQCISbA,4230239,4237600,radisson blue hotel in gumahati okay  seven o'clock we are being told viewers  that's going to be  the most important press conference of
RAiQNQCISbA,4237600,4244640,the day let me tell you seven o'clock we  will hear from the shinde camp i want to  go back to aruni who's outside
RAiQNQCISbA,4244640,4252480,is he a fighter how far will he take  this  you know him very well  is he going to in case at 7 pm shinde
RAiQNQCISbA,4252480,4257960,says nothing doing i'm not coming to  meet you is he going to pull the plug
RAiQNQCISbA,4261760,4267520,the question is whether the train has  actually left the station whether these  rebel mlas have taken that plunge to
RAiQNQCISbA,4267520,4272960,move out of syria mudotakray cena camp  and that is why obviously this cannot be
RAiQNQCISbA,4272960,4280480,a one day's game this was a pre-planned  thing from uh from ikna shinde he must  have spoken individually with all these
RAiQNQCISbA,4280480,4285600,mlas that went to surah then all the way  they have been taken to guwahati so all
RAiQNQCISbA,4285600,4291520,these uh whatever whatever cm  will be throwing at them they must be  prepared for that as well this was an
RAiQNQCISbA,4291520,4296640,emotional appeal because if siemuta  would have directly removed them uh as
RAiQNQCISbA,4296640,4302880,the mlas of cefsena probably it wouldn't  have given a very good signal to the  shefsena party workers because all of
RAiQNQCISbA,4302880,4309280,them have been have been speaking on the  hindutva lines all of them have been  attacking cm withdraw and his close
RAiQNQCISbA,4309280,4316320,confidance on hindu two lines saying  that they have compromised hindu by by  joining hands with the arch rivals of
RAiQNQCISbA,4316320,4321760,late baltacra that is the congress and  the ncp so basically first he defended  himself
RAiQNQCISbA,4321760,4327040,coming in and i want to bring in radhika  on this what we are being told is that  more senator mlas after hearing uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,4327040,4332560,takre perhaps admitting to the fact that  he is facing a crisis a deep one have
RAiQNQCISbA,4332560,4339040,decided to decap four to five more cena  mlas are turning rebels and they are
RAiQNQCISbA,4339040,4345040,going to go to guwahati radhika  you have been speaking to a large number
RAiQNQCISbA,4345040,4351840,of these mlas and you know that the  party has been making an outreach to  some of them what have they been saying
RAiQNQCISbA,4351840,4358320,in return  you know as far as these mlas we did  interact with a few of them who are in
RAiQNQCISbA,4358320,4363440,fact leaving for russia in fact that  meeting is also set to take place in a
RAiQNQCISbA,4363440,4368640,few minutes from now these are  obviously  loyalists they were quite confident they
RAiQNQCISbA,4368640,4374000,kept talking about certain numbers which  they were they themselves were unsure  about uh they were talking about the
RAiQNQCISbA,4374000,4379040,fact that they have more than 20 mlas  they have more support of several more
RAiQNQCISbA,4379040,4385840,mlas they will go with the letter but  unfortunately though they don't know  their numbers uh as yet especially the
RAiQNQCISbA,4385840,4390960,loyalists of uh  and it is on the expected lines that
RAiQNQCISbA,4390960,4397600,more mlas give me 30 seconds i want to  go across to amit rajput also who's got  this input amit rajput
RAiQNQCISbA,4397600,4405379,up  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,4422800,4425800,um
RAiQNQCISbA,4438480,4441480,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,4456800,4462960,a big fast we are being told that those  pictures on your screens are of these  mlas that have arrived at that surat
RAiQNQCISbA,4462960,4468480,resort and from there they're going to  be taken to guati but the great fast now  that is playing our viewers is that udav
RAiQNQCISbA,4468480,4475280,takaru doesn't have the numbers is still  clinging on he's decided  to stay on political instability
RAiQNQCISbA,4475280,4480560,continues in the state of maharashtra  malaysia has no ordinary state of the  indian union viewers it's one of the
RAiQNQCISbA,4480560,4486320,most industrialized states at a time  when there is economic uncertainty can  we afford a government distracted by a
RAiQNQCISbA,4486320,4492000,crisis can we actually afford a  government that's not in control can we  afford viewers most importantly a
RAiQNQCISbA,4492000,4498880,government  that is only clinging on to power  forgetting about the people fundamental
RAiQNQCISbA,4498880,4506560,questions tonight fundamental questions  if the doesn't have the numbers  he should quit or he should immediately
RAiQNQCISbA,4506560,4513040,call for a floor test and the  uncertainty instead of going through the  hoops of suggesting that shinde must
RAiQNQCISbA,4513040,4518320,come stand in front of him and tell him  what he thinks of him that's putting ego
RAiQNQCISbA,4518320,4524480,above the welfare of the people and  welfare of the state i want to go across  to sharing i want to go across to madhav
RAiQNQCISbA,4524480,4531040,uh mother will all come down at the end  of the day to what the bjp has to say  and let's be honest the bjp has kept its
RAiQNQCISbA,4531040,4536159,cards very very close to his chest aruni  i'm there with you i can see you in the  frame just hold your camera straight and
RAiQNQCISbA,4536159,4543600,turn around  i'm coming right out to you but mother  this is really fundamental isn't it it  is really fundamental the bjp needs to
RAiQNQCISbA,4543600,4547920,come out and also tell us what it's  thinking
RAiQNQCISbA,4551120,4556320,well absolutely and rahul the central  leadership of the party has been  extremely tight-lipped we've not seen
RAiQNQCISbA,4556320,4561760,the bjp even come out and participate in  panel debates over the last 24 hours on  this issue they're not expected to do so
RAiQNQCISbA,4561760,4567280,today because clearly they have taken a  position that all of this is happening  organically from within the shift sena
RAiQNQCISbA,4567280,4573920,is when the split is happening however  one person who certainly knows exactly  what's happening is devendra fund was he
RAiQNQCISbA,4573920,4580000,is the person who shared pawar has and  agadi members have alleged is  orchestrating this well that may or may
RAiQNQCISbA,4580000,4587120,not be true the fact is that uh they are  the cena mlas are in a bjp rule state at  this point of time they have been bjp uh
RAiQNQCISbA,4587120,4593679,leaders who have in fact visited the  hotels there as well as in gujarat when  they were lodged in surat so the bjp in
RAiQNQCISbA,4593679,4600080,the background certainly of course will  have an important role to play and it's  very clear that iknac shinde on his own  cannot form a government he will need
RAiQNQCISbA,4600080,4605440,the support of the bjp whatever deal may  have been struck between him or the bjp  it's something that is not extremely
RAiQNQCISbA,4605440,4610719,clear at the moment certainly there is  talk of him being offered the deputy  chief minister's post but what exactly
RAiQNQCISbA,4610719,4617040,is it that has been worked out and at  this point of time when uddhav takri is  making such a fervent appeal a party
RAiQNQCISbA,4617040,4622719,known you know for his strongman image  kind of politics you know for uddhav the  chief minister you're virtually
RAiQNQCISbA,4622719,4629440,appealing making that emotive appeal  saying that come to me talk to me and i  will even step down from the chief  minister's post if that was indeed the
RAiQNQCISbA,4629440,4634800,case the question that many are asking  is did the thakris not have their ear to  the ground now of course as the ship has
RAiQNQCISbA,4634800,4640000,sailed as the uh  trainers left the station as arunian was  saying now is it a bit too late in the
RAiQNQCISbA,4640000,4645520,day for the targets to be making that  kind of an appeal that's the question  that many are asking and of course the
RAiQNQCISbA,4645520,4651040,numbers earlier in the day when the  letter was sent out the numbers of  course was short of 37 is what we were
RAiQNQCISbA,4651040,4658159,told with more mla is now reaching the  fold of ignacinda will he become that  much closer to that number of 37 which
RAiQNQCISbA,4658159,4664080,virtually makes him immune from any kind  of anti-defection law or proceedings the  battle of course for who will be the
RAiQNQCISbA,4664080,4670800,leader uh who can issue a whip uh the  speaker all of that of course playing  out on the sidelines
RAiQNQCISbA,4670800,4675800,what's happening behind you a lot of  movement outside varshah
RAiQNQCISbA,4678730,4686800,[Music]  however not an mla all are expecting the
RAiQNQCISbA,4686800,4693920,bus of the ships mls to reach over here  in some time and that's why a police  heavy police deployment has been done uh
RAiQNQCISbA,4693920,4699040,at the entrance of the road of uh that  is the residence of syria mudakre a
RAiQNQCISbA,4699040,4706560,meeting with these ships mlas who have  decided to stay back with cm with the  takris cam around 16 or 17 of them have
RAiQNQCISbA,4706560,4711600,decided to stay back is scheduled to be  held uh with cmu and also we understand
RAiQNQCISbA,4711600,4716719,that saratova is expected to have a  telephonic conversation uh with cm
RAiQNQCISbA,4716719,4722480,as well what will be the future cause of  action what will be the next plan of  action if ikna
RAiQNQCISbA,4722480,4727600,agrees if he doesn't agree then clearly  it is a big big trouble for cmu today
RAiQNQCISbA,4727600,4732800,and what should be the next course of  action then what technicalities
RAiQNQCISbA,4732800,4741920,and his team should offer everything  will be decided after coordinating with  the mahavika sagari stakeholders mainly
RAiQNQCISbA,4742239,4749120,they will be coordinating and are giving  out and giving out a piece of advice to  cmu  because in today's media interaction as
RAiQNQCISbA,4749120,4754560,well uh  pointed towards the fact that i would  have been i wouldn't have mine if
RAiQNQCISbA,4754560,4761679,congress of congress or ncp would have  told me that i am incapable but it is my  men who have deserted me and that is
RAiQNQCISbA,4761679,4769040,extremely hurtful very emotional plea  being made by cm udot  what will be the retort or response from
RAiQNQCISbA,4769040,4775760,ikna sindhi and his camp that we will be  keeping a close eye on  that is very very critical viewers it's
RAiQNQCISbA,4775760,4783840,all coming down now  to uh  the ego  of uddhav takre it's now all
RAiQNQCISbA,4783840,4790960,in the mind  he's lost it on the ground  it's now in the mind radhika this is now
RAiQNQCISbA,4790960,4796800,coming down to ego and i'm going to open  this up right after you respond to me  also of course sharing there with us
RAiQNQCISbA,4796800,4803760,sharing who is tracking the ncp and the  congress i want your input on this but  first radhika radhika what do you expect
RAiQNQCISbA,4803760,4811360,happening uh after  seven o'clock  when  and i can write this down shinde says i
RAiQNQCISbA,4811360,4816840,am not coming to meet you dav takre  what's going to happen next  you know as far as
RAiQNQCISbA,4816840,4822400,uh is concerned we know for a fact that  in that resolution letter he has written
RAiQNQCISbA,4822400,4829360,very categorically he's spoken about his  dissatisfaction and discontent of all  those 34 mlas who signed it so that is
RAiQNQCISbA,4829360,4836159,something he'll reiterate at the meeting  at that press conference is something  that we can expect their dissatisfaction
RAiQNQCISbA,4836159,4843120,their discontent the fact that uh  mahavira mahavika sagar itself was  formed despite differences within the
RAiQNQCISbA,4843120,4848320,senate despite ideological differences  with the congress and the ncp so yes uh
RAiQNQCISbA,4848320,4855440,you know of the resolution that the  content of the resolution letter will be  something that will be spoken by uh
RAiQNQCISbA,4855440,4860719,and  in most likelihood he will say that he  may not be meeting
RAiQNQCISbA,4860719,4867440,a face-to-face meeting may not happen  not entirely certain if they will appeal  to the chief minister to put in his
RAiQNQCISbA,4867440,4872560,papers up but there is a possibility  that he could speak of what the next
RAiQNQCISbA,4872560,4879600,step is because dissolution is something  that no party wants at the moment they  do not want re-election what they want
RAiQNQCISbA,4879600,4884719,is the formation of a government so in  most likelihood what could happen is
RAiQNQCISbA,4884719,4892719,perhaps a pact that may be sealed with  the bjp will that be revealed in that  press conference that remains to be seen
RAiQNQCISbA,4892719,4898239,okay that's very very interesting we're  also being told of course viewers and  we've reported this earlier that  shahrukh pawar will be meeting udav
RAiQNQCISbA,4898239,4905520,tagre very shortly we're going to have  to see what happens sharing  this is really also a matter
RAiQNQCISbA,4905520,4911760,of  grave disappointment to the congress and  the ncp they invested a lot in uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,4911760,4916678,they feel that uddhav let the site down
RAiQNQCISbA,4921840,4927679,absolutely and that is what uh the  opinion of both the congress and the ncp  has been though they are not openly
RAiQNQCISbA,4927679,4934320,blaming shiv sena or rudolf but they  have hinted that it is in fact an  internal matter as far as shift sena is
RAiQNQCISbA,4934320,4939679,concerned and the owners lies on  himself to put the house in order now
RAiQNQCISbA,4939679,4945440,till yesterday  it seems that he thought that things  would in fact come back to normal things
RAiQNQCISbA,4945440,4951679,would in fact be sorted out but we have  seen how at 1 pm cabaret meeting as well  there were only three ministers from
RAiQNQCISbA,4951679,4958800,shivsena even at 5 pm the mla meeting  that was in fact called there has in  fact been no turnout of the mlas though
RAiQNQCISbA,4958800,4965360,the uh the the 15 of the mlas who were  here last night are in fact on their way  and uh this is the road that is in fact
RAiQNQCISbA,4965360,4971040,leading uh towards uh udav thakura's  residence and you can see there is in  fact a lot of chaotic situation there is
RAiQNQCISbA,4971040,4977360,a lot of movement that is happening we  are expecting the mlas to come here okay  the bjp the bjp has responded viewers
RAiQNQCISbA,4977360,4983360,the bjp putting out one of its first  tweets really via its national  spokesperson amit malvia saying
RAiQNQCISbA,4983360,4989040,uttaphthal inherited the party power in  ballasive's legacy he became cm by  deceit and has been one of the worst
RAiQNQCISbA,4989040,4996159,performing chief ministers today despite  being in power he's no control over his  party legislators disapproval of his  government classic case of incompetence
RAiQNQCISbA,4996159,5001840,so first salvo fired by the bjp straight  directly at ud
RAiQNQCISbA,5001840,5009920,uh this really changes equations doesn't  it matter this shows that the bjp  is not even going to accept in case
RAiQNQCISbA,5009920,5015120,decides that look the time has come that  we come back to the fold etc etc at this  moment
RAiQNQCISbA,5015120,5019920,there is no question of it yes mother
RAiQNQCISbA,5022639,5029199,well we do seem to be point that past of  no return rahul and clearly the bjp  making its position very clear with this
RAiQNQCISbA,5029199,5035120,one tweet as you rightly mentioned amit  malwa who's a head of the social media  department of the bjp coming out and
RAiQNQCISbA,5035120,5042400,saying that udav thakri has inherited  the power party and bala sahab's legacy  he became cm by deceit and has been one
RAiQNQCISbA,5042400,5048400,of the worst performing cms despite  being in power has no control over his  party his left one second i just need to
RAiQNQCISbA,5048400,5054800,go across to deepak  cena mla who is backing shinde the  rebels so he's part of the rebel faction
RAiQNQCISbA,5054800,5060609,mr  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,5075120,5078120,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,5110239,5116800,is he playing for time he is admitting  he doesn't have the numbers should he  not just quit
RAiQNQCISbA,5116880,5124400,uh i'll not be able to make any comments  on this but what has happened till this  date i can tell you about that whatever
RAiQNQCISbA,5124400,5130000,decision he wants to take he is after a  leader of a party so he can take his own  decisions
RAiQNQCISbA,5130000,5137920,but whatever has happened  i briefed you about the causes why  the entire thing happened okay so
RAiQNQCISbA,5137920,5140920,uh
RAiQNQCISbA,5154400,5161520,you save them  from the trouble of not serving them  there's nobody serving them right now
RAiQNQCISbA,5161760,5167360,uh  yeah but this decision should  be there within  within
RAiQNQCISbA,5167360,5174400,one week i should have the picture would  be clear so you mean to say one of  india's most important industrially
RAiQNQCISbA,5174400,5181120,advanced states will have no government  for one week as this sort of game it is
RAiQNQCISbA,5181120,5187199,it is the government is already there  the government is not working sir we  will continue to rule sir
RAiQNQCISbA,5187199,5192239,the mlas are sitting in guwahati  uh you yourself
RAiQNQCISbA,5192239,5197360,are  you know sorry to say but  fighting a crisis
RAiQNQCISbA,5197360,5204800,how are we going to serve the people sir  the uh  the cabinet it had a meeting today they
RAiQNQCISbA,5204800,5211040,have taken several decisions so  basically the candidate transfer with
RAiQNQCISbA,5218800,5223760,uh  i'm not aware of this but
RAiQNQCISbA,5231040,5237199,now that is a sign in itself that he has  lost  the uh perhaps respect i don't know if i
RAiQNQCISbA,5237199,5243280,can use that word but certainly the  support of a large number of his own  mlas they don't want him to be chief
RAiQNQCISbA,5243280,5248560,minister they believe he's incompetent  that he's drifted away from the core  ideology of the shift cena
RAiQNQCISbA,5248560,5258000,how can a man who is not being able to  serve his own father's legacy serve the  people of the state of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,5258000,5263040,no  this is not the issues are being mixed
RAiQNQCISbA,5263520,5269120,there is no rebel against the cn  actually it is based on an issue the
RAiQNQCISbA,5269120,5275520,issue of giving support to one okay or  the other party  when it's score a coalition
RAiQNQCISbA,5275520,5281360,it is for the party to decide with whom  they want to go because none of the  party have a security
RAiQNQCISbA,5281360,5287440,visuals coming in thank you sir thank  you very much mr kesarkar we are none  the wiser after that conversation but uh
RAiQNQCISbA,5287440,5292719,let's just hope that uh shinde clears  matters up for us in the next 45 minutes  i want to go straight across to these
RAiQNQCISbA,5292719,5298159,pictures these are uddhav takrez  residence pictures varsha there's the  chief minister's home aruni is there
RAiQNQCISbA,5298159,5305719,aruni what's happening supriya sule  jitendrawat a large number of other  people showing up there ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,5308560,5316400,well more significantly it was sharatawa  the ncp supremo the person who had  basically weaved this unnatural alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,5316400,5321679,of the shift senate the congress and the  ncp ideologically different uh political
RAiQNQCISbA,5321679,5328000,parties sharat tawar has come to the  residence of asiya muda takre basically  one can say that this is the first time
RAiQNQCISbA,5328000,5334400,that sharat tawar has has come to see  him with takris residence after this  entire issue had cropped up he had
RAiQNQCISbA,5334400,5341120,spoken from delhi basically saying that  this is this mess is shifts  internal problems
RAiQNQCISbA,5341120,5347199,uh has to sort it out but now one can  say that saratova has joined in the  fight character somebody a veteran
RAiQNQCISbA,5347199,5354400,politician a senior politician who's  also been called as a chanakya in the  state of maharashtra at least now what
RAiQNQCISbA,5354400,5360560,uh help he can provide to see him  that we will be keeping a close
RAiQNQCISbA,5361280,5368480,i just lost the signal there but uh it's  quite clear that the ncp rushing now the  ncp rushing remember uddhav takri said
RAiQNQCISbA,5368480,5374719,on  his  live address to the state that it was  pawar was instrumental in really giving
RAiQNQCISbA,5374719,5380639,him the support encouragement to become  chief minister and accept the position  he wasn't really interested he put that
RAiQNQCISbA,5380639,5387280,on pawar pawana rushing to the residents  saying don't let the site down do  whatever it takes
RAiQNQCISbA,5387280,5394639,but viewers  if shinde says that he has nothing more  to do with the ship say now all of this  is not going to matter the only only
RAiQNQCISbA,5394639,5401679,salvation is to call shinde's bluff  expel  the shiv sena mlas and then hold a floor
RAiQNQCISbA,5401679,5408000,test that's the only other option left i  want to open this up 30 seconds i'm  coming right back to aruni i just want
RAiQNQCISbA,5408000,5414080,to get a quick sound bite in from sanjay  devi leader of the shiv sena sheikha  here shantanu gupta varun singh and dr

RAiQNQCISbA,5535920,5542400,but what the targaryen shiv cena did in  2019  is like that is like the like the law
RAiQNQCISbA,5542400,5547600,which you cannot go go bottom two he  betrayed bjp and betrayed shivsena's

RAiQNQCISbA,5554000,5560080,government is being run in last two two  and a half years i'm sure it's a classic  case of how a government should not be

RAiQNQCISbA,5567120,5575199,are capturing  uh you are bringing the house of  bollywood people you are taking a  journalist to jail if
RAiQNQCISbA,5578639,5585679,government should not be run well if the  government is flailing viewers  if it is imploding on its own self
RAiQNQCISbA,5585679,5591040,if its own mlas especially the ships and  mlas have lost faith in their own chief  minister
RAiQNQCISbA,5591040,5597600,then that becomes doubly problematic  doubly problematic let me go across to  varun singh senior journalist
RAiQNQCISbA,5597600,5601239,you know um
RAiQNQCISbA,5607920,5614560,he wasn't accessible mla is the biggest  the biggest grouse that any mla may be
RAiQNQCISbA,5614560,5621920,from the ruling alliance  and especially congress they have is  that the cm was never accessible to them
RAiQNQCISbA,5621920,5628080,he would not meet them  and you know while you were talking
RAiQNQCISbA,5628080,5630239,you
RAiQNQCISbA,5644960,5652159,has to decide whether he is going to  stay or go so let me tell you many mlas  over here also right now in mumbai who
RAiQNQCISbA,5652159,5658800,are going for the meeting of hawaii  mumbai they also are you know their  heart is in guwahati not in mumbai and
RAiQNQCISbA,5658800,5663920,what is in guwahati not in mumbai we are  going to go across to guate in just a  few moments i want to go straight back
RAiQNQCISbA,5663920,5670960,to aruni laruni describe what's  happening many more cars entering that  residence now who has landed up what is
RAiQNQCISbA,5670960,5673840,expected
RAiQNQCISbA,5678730,5685520,[Music]  go ahead aruni
RAiQNQCISbA,5685520,5691199,yes  okay i don't think we have aruni right  now we're trying to get you the latest
RAiQNQCISbA,5691199,5698080,pictures from outside varsha viewers uh  those are the pictures that are coming  in of course we are being told that
RAiQNQCISbA,5698840,5704880,um  it was an anticipated uh step on his  part uh uttar takari coming out and
RAiQNQCISbA,5704880,5710960,making it very clear that he was  instrumental in actually convincing him  to take on the chief minister's job so  what's really happening this is turning
RAiQNQCISbA,5710960,5716560,into a bit of a fast you know it's very  very interesting everything that rudolph  thakura said today there was one basic
RAiQNQCISbA,5716560,5721760,question he did not answer rahul which  is that eikna cindy and group are saying
RAiQNQCISbA,5721760,5727920,it is antithetical to the very idea of  the shiv cena to continue in alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,5727920,5733600,with the ncp and the congress if you see  the resolution that has been signed by
RAiQNQCISbA,5733600,5739600,23 mlas or 34 pardon me mlas off the  ship cena
RAiQNQCISbA,5739600,5745679,they say that we are being damaged we  are an ideologically strong party and we
RAiQNQCISbA,5745679,5752480,are being damaged by this alliance  uddhav thakrei spoke about hindutva  said i'm going to give up the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,5752480,5759600,ministers post the chief minister as  residents if you so want but he did not  answer the key question varun singh and
RAiQNQCISbA,5759600,5765679,the key question remains  will he continue in this alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,5765679,5770040,can he continue in this alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,5772560,5779760,i think  to my mind i think it's all uh i was  wondering why as the whole uh flock of
RAiQNQCISbA,5779760,5786000,cena is still together how they are able  to  digest that  shifts the party like shivsena are able
RAiQNQCISbA,5786000,5792880,to digest that you can't recite hanuman  chalisa in in in bala  is maharashtra how you can't even
RAiQNQCISbA,5792880,5800159,properly celebrate dahi handi i was just  wondering why it took so late for shiv  senec were true shiv cynics of bala
RAiQNQCISbA,5800159,5805520,to wait this long so i was just i think  i was on many others was just waiting  for this i think it just took too long
RAiQNQCISbA,5805520,5812960,for them to to revolt  all right uh let me take this across to
RAiQNQCISbA,5834190,5837300,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,5880960,5886800,let's just listen in for those who are  joining in right now  there were some very important and
RAiQNQCISbA,5886800,5893119,interesting things that uddhav  said but there were more things that he  left unsaid
RAiQNQCISbA,5893119,5896800,listen to a few excerpts of
RAiQNQCISbA,5936560,5938960,face to
RAiQNQCISbA,5949840,5952840,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,5998080,6004800,all right who's just coming in uh uh  press conference is going to be  addressed by eight not shinde at 7 pm it
RAiQNQCISbA,6004800,6010159,is quite clear from the tone and tenor  of the resolution the letter that was  sent earlier by the rebel mla is that
RAiQNQCISbA,6010159,6016880,they are not in any mood to try and  negotiate with the chief minister but  remember that letter was drafted and
RAiQNQCISbA,6016880,6024239,sent before uddha takre's emotional  speech varun singh do you think there is  any possibility that
RAiQNQCISbA,6024239,6029840,they could agree to the outreach uddhav  interestingly almost offered the cm's
RAiQNQCISbA,6029840,6035840,post tuition by saying i will move out  of mata shri but you come and speak to  me
RAiQNQCISbA,6043600,6049600,i didn't find it very emotional to an  extent that many others and especially  many social edicts would have
RAiQNQCISbA,6049600,6054960,but you know  cena and social i had almost the  ceilings on the ground room so if i had
RAiQNQCISbA,6054960,6062000,spoken even people who are very close to  buddha working matushri and other places  they also had made their mind that
RAiQNQCISbA,6062000,6068480,probably he would resign and he would  step down and whatever is being  happening it will continue he would go
RAiQNQCISbA,6068480,6075119,away and uh  what was expected didn't happen and it  has led to a lot of confusion over here
RAiQNQCISbA,6075119,6080159,even amongst many socialists as i was  telling rav srishankar
RAiQNQCISbA,6080159,6086800,when he was talking to the bhakti circle  if you see what deepak kesaker said is  clear that the mlas have conveyed what
RAiQNQCISbA,6086800,6094480,they want and the number of people who  are reaching varsha right now if you see  they are more of ncp than the sushina
RAiQNQCISbA,6094480,6100480,because ncp wants this government to  stay because they are the one who have  gained a lot from this government but
RAiQNQCISbA,6100480,6107360,cena and congress haven't and it was  clearly visible in the mlc polls also  where ncp got more votes
RAiQNQCISbA,6107360,6112560,than the number it has and cena as as  shantanu rightly pointed out the hindu
RAiQNQCISbA,6112560,6119679,ideology listen  comes from an area called  ignat shinde has been counting on his
RAiQNQCISbA,6119679,6127280,words because of the hindu ideology for  all these years he have been  continuously presenting thani and the  popery area for 15 long years without
RAiQNQCISbA,6127280,6133360,any halt only because he comes from a  party that has stuck to that particular
RAiQNQCISbA,6133360,6138800,one agenda and ideology of hindutva but  when the party stays silent on
RAiQNQCISbA,6138800,6144320,the palghar sadhu the party says stays  silent when you know uh
RAiQNQCISbA,6144320,6150880,there are hoardings in delhi not  sovereign  and this is the party that would go on
RAiQNQCISbA,6150880,6156639,with samna front page that if anyone  abuses sauerkraut we are going to bash  them up and now it remains silent how do
RAiQNQCISbA,6156639,6163760,you expect  to win the tha municipal corporation  with an alliance like this he knows that
RAiQNQCISbA,6163760,6172000,the value the election machinery of  sushina right now is so low that they  wouldn't be able to win elections in the
RAiQNQCISbA,6172000,6180480,it's interesting you mentioned  because even as we speak these posters  have gone up in thane of balthakray on
RAiQNQCISbA,6180480,6187440,one side  and  you have  aiknot shinde in the middle and mr d his
RAiQNQCISbA,6187440,6195920,guru in politics on the other side so  there is no  there is no other tita in these posters
RAiQNQCISbA,6195920,6203520,uh on one side you have balashave on one  side and you have ekna chande in the  middle and it says that you are our real
RAiQNQCISbA,6203520,6209360,chief minister  when you are saying that this is all  about ideology
RAiQNQCISbA,6209360,6216400,what do you mean are you saying that  shiseina is going to go back uddhaftakar  is going to go back to bjp or that more
RAiQNQCISbA,6216400,6223040,cena mlas are going to desert him  wholesale what exactly  is uttara takri going to achieve by
RAiQNQCISbA,6223040,6229600,holding on right now you know  more more of the senate mls are  destroying the party right now you can i
RAiQNQCISbA,6229600,6235679,i'm telling you there are many people  sitting away as i said the heart  lies in guwahati right now while their
RAiQNQCISbA,6235679,6242159,bodies over here and not only that  ideology is something based on which  cena has won so many elections okay
RAiQNQCISbA,6242159,6248560,cannot move beyond ideology they have  seen what is happening in other areas in  spite of they putting a joint candidate
RAiQNQCISbA,6248560,6256560,in pandarp bjp one in spite of the three  parties coming together they have one  rajya sabha they have one mlc polls and
RAiQNQCISbA,6256560,6263199,this is clearly any person who's in  politics can see what the mood of common  public in maharashtra and mumbai is and
RAiQNQCISbA,6263199,6270560,any person who's sitting here in mumbai  knows what will be the outcome of bmc  elections if this alliance continues for
RAiQNQCISbA,6270560,6276080,the cena last election bjp and cena were  neck to neck this time the bjp might
RAiQNQCISbA,6276080,6284560,snatch it away and i'm sure i'm telling  you i've covered cena for such a long  time they wouldn't want to lose bmc
RAiQNQCISbA,6284560,6289840,okay so this is not just about a battle  of existence and the core ideology and
RAiQNQCISbA,6289840,6296080,the core voter of the senate but more  material concerns right now which is the  impending elections to the bmc please
RAiQNQCISbA,6296080,6301600,stay with me gentlemen chanting gupta  i'll just come back to you but on this  story of the posters that have gone up
RAiQNQCISbA,6301600,6308639,of eight not shinde arunil what are the  insiders telling you what exactly is the  game plan for now from the general
RAiQNQCISbA,6308639,6316440,demeanor of uddhav takre it seems quite  clear he knows he doesn't have the  numbers so what next
RAiQNQCISbA,6322639,6327679,also has the number because the magical  number for them is 37. now we have seen
RAiQNQCISbA,6327679,6332880,the letter  in this camp has floated the 34 mlas had
RAiQNQCISbA,6332880,6338400,signed in that one mla has already  returned to his home so it becomes 33.
RAiQNQCISbA,6338400,6345440,now we understand that three of those  mlas are independent mlas baju kadu's is  also a part of it
RAiQNQCISbA,6345440,6352639,is an independent mla not a part of the  ship sina so basically to get that  two-third a majority within the 55 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,6352639,6358239,that shift sena has uh it becomes  extremely  difficult it becomes difficult for the
RAiQNQCISbA,6358239,6365760,akna cinder camp as well they will need  the magical figure of 37 and that is why  that is the only reason why the bjp has
RAiQNQCISbA,6365760,6372560,not jumped into the parade developer  whatever he's been orchestrating  whatever he's been doing that is all
RAiQNQCISbA,6372560,6377600,behind the curtains not on the not  exactly into the spotlight so ignacion
RAiQNQCISbA,6377600,6383920,these numbers will also be extremely  paramount what he says at 7 p.m will be  very crucial with respect to uttar
RAiQNQCISbA,6383920,6390400,takarasiya  but he has defended but one can say that  he has defended well he has made a kind
RAiQNQCISbA,6390400,6395600,of a kind of an appeal to his party  workers by not removing his mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,6395600,6403119,directly and whatever will be the  response from his mlas accordingly only  cm udakar will react now and to his aid
RAiQNQCISbA,6403119,6409280,is now sharatawa the veteran politician  who had basically stitched this  unnatural alliance of ideologically
RAiQNQCISbA,6409280,6415840,different political parties now yes the  ball is clearly in the court of ignacion  de camp whatever they decide because
RAiQNQCISbA,6415840,6421199,ikna shinde he may be solely wanting to  separate from the from udot race camp
RAiQNQCISbA,6421199,6427679,but whether the whether all the other  amulets are completely willing and ready  to do it that is also a big point of
RAiQNQCISbA,6427679,6434719,question that arises over here and why  hasn't devendra pandavis or the bjp  openly come into the picture till now
RAiQNQCISbA,6434719,6439040,when they come into the picture openly  then only
RAiQNQCISbA,6439920,6444239,radhika  what's being discussed there
RAiQNQCISbA,6445040,6451119,that's right that's right there had been  a back-to-back meetings inside devendra  farnava's residence there are several
RAiQNQCISbA,6451119,6456880,top leaders of the bjp here the rashi  sheila beat darikar
RAiQNQCISbA,6457040,6463920,many mlas have been going and getting  out of the residence as well since  morning so you know as far as devendra
RAiQNQCISbA,6463920,6470320,nava's camp is concerned as far as bjp  is concerned they are waiting and  watching because as arun was pointing
RAiQNQCISbA,6470320,6475840,out they do not want to jump the ship  sorry they do not want to jump the gun  simply because of what happened two and
RAiQNQCISbA,6475840,6481840,a half years ago when the entire ajit  pawar devendra farnam's episode happened  and fatnevis had to give him that
RAiQNQCISbA,6481840,6488000,resignation within no time so that is  something they don't want to repeat of  they want to see the numbers before they
RAiQNQCISbA,6488000,6493280,really jump the gun so now of course  what they are uh you know  there are series of interactions
RAiQNQCISbA,6493280,6500159,happening with the mlas they are keeping  they are trying to tell them to keep to  keep themselves safe and to make sure
RAiQNQCISbA,6500159,6507520,that they are not being forced i think  there's something happening there where  are you standing over to your own
RAiQNQCISbA,6510719,6517520,well this was a ships in our leader  weber nike who had come over here he's  basically heading to the residence of uh
RAiQNQCISbA,6517520,6524400,cm  in fact there is a meeting that has been  held at cm with the thakras residence  wherein sharathavar has reached his
RAiQNQCISbA,6524400,6531600,daughter supriya is also inside along  with jitendra we also understand that  ajit pawar has called in a meeting of
RAiQNQCISbA,6531600,6537280,the ncp mlas tomorrow so ncp also  keeping their cards close to their chest
RAiQNQCISbA,6537280,6542880,but one can say character did  till now had not openly entered uh into
RAiQNQCISbA,6542880,6548320,this fight or fray one can say but now  he has made an entry at cmu takara's
RAiQNQCISbA,6548320,6553440,residence so he has joined the fight  officially now what transpires it will
RAiQNQCISbA,6553440,6559520,be extremely extremely interesting  because who would have imagined that  ikna shinde one of the close confidants
RAiQNQCISbA,6559520,6565520,of ca muda takre he will leave the city  of mumbai along with more than 30 plus
RAiQNQCISbA,6565520,6572400,mlas of the ship sinners here yes the  numbers may not be with us  but ignace in this camp also needs that
RAiQNQCISbA,6572400,6578480,magical figure of 37 and also obviously  the support of devendra padnavez and the
RAiQNQCISbA,6578480,6584320,legal technicalities we in fact spoke to  senior jurist mukul rahabi just a while
RAiQNQCISbA,6584320,6590159,ago we will explain to our viewers what  the legal options are and they are  frankly not that complicated
RAiQNQCISbA,6590159,6596159,but before that i want to go across  to  the congress leader who is here with us
RAiQNQCISbA,6596159,6601199,dr shankar guha dr guha for how many  days because most people now believe
RAiQNQCISbA,6601199,6607400,it's not about if  it's a question of when
RAiQNQCISbA,6611360,6616800,the  biggest point to be noted here is  padmaja
RAiQNQCISbA,6616800,6623520,you know  the bjp is a pro at this operation  kamala or the operation lotus
RAiQNQCISbA,6623520,6633280,let me tell you 2008 it started in  karnataka  2017 uttarakhand 2017 goa 2019 again
RAiQNQCISbA,6633280,6640320,karnataka 2020 a successful attempt in  madhya pradesh and again an unsuccessful
RAiQNQCISbA,6640320,6647280,attempt in rajasthan  so breaking the party they're a pro at  it they could probably you know begin a
RAiQNQCISbA,6647280,6652320,university at this one has to note the  people of this country have to note this
RAiQNQCISbA,6652320,6659840,how is it that these mlas are chartering  around the whole country flip-flopping  flying you know lavishly spending their
RAiQNQCISbA,6659840,6666760,days in lavish resorts who's funding all  this  and this whole
RAiQNQCISbA,6672800,6681679,but anyway on a more serious note  can we come back to my question no no  bjp knows the answer best to this bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,6681679,6687760,of course of course now allow me to  complete when the  national conference and the pdp was part
RAiQNQCISbA,6687760,6694960,of the nda then there was no hindutva  cry so this is nothing but an attempt  from the bjp to dismantle this whole
RAiQNQCISbA,6694960,6700239,system and i am sure and i am very  hopeful  also that i spoke to some of my friends
RAiQNQCISbA,6700239,6707280,in maharashtra they are very hopeful  that ekna shindeji and his camp will  return back and i was just seeing in
RAiQNQCISbA,6707280,6712480,your channel mr uddhav takara has sent a  very courageous message and invited them
RAiQNQCISbA,6712480,6721320,over we are very hopeful that they will  come back  it's a courageous message that has given
RAiQNQCISbA,6724320,6730159,of course of course he's given he is  being courageous  he's been handling do you agree well and
RAiQNQCISbA,6730159,6736239,he's waiting he's given him his message  his message is quite clear it's not just  one about courage it's also about tiago
RAiQNQCISbA,6736239,6742239,where uddhav is saying i'm willing to  give it all up for the cause of hindu  for the greater good of the country and
RAiQNQCISbA,6742239,6747440,democracy and secularism come take take  varsha  shantanu gupta
RAiQNQCISbA,6747440,6753360,i think i think he's just buying time  he's just sensing which way it will turn  out in maybe a couple of hours or a
RAiQNQCISbA,6753360,6760159,couple of days i think where was he when  rahul gandhi was putting posters against  her where was he when palgar sadhus were
RAiQNQCISbA,6760159,6766560,lynched and he was mom where was he when  is  his police compression of mumbai were  absconding his ministers are in jail the
RAiQNQCISbA,6766560,6772560,way he ran the government everyone knows  as i told before is a classic case of  how to not run a government
RAiQNQCISbA,6772560,6778639,and i think in politics betrayals are  heard but how he betrayed bjp two two  and a half years back he's trying to
RAiQNQCISbA,6778639,6784480,take he's now tasting his own medicine  nothing karma is catching on i think he  was just wondering why it took so long
RAiQNQCISbA,6784480,6790480,for shits and it's the true shift  signings the ballast ships and  how it took so long for them to feel the
RAiQNQCISbA,6790480,6797199,guilt of how the way without having  karma  not bending to sonia and he was just he
RAiQNQCISbA,6797199,6803599,was just bitured in front of uh and then  that was that was traumatic for many of  us who lied shift saying that the way
RAiQNQCISbA,6803599,6811199,she said operated in the in the in the  ballast attacker days i think it was  always said that uh uddhav thakura is
RAiQNQCISbA,6811199,6816800,anyway not a true descendant of the  ballast  legacy was this rajasthan or was it
RAiQNQCISbA,6816800,6824400,someone else i i don't know but the way  the conducted himself when he got the  power it was literally uh like okay 10
RAiQNQCISbA,6824400,6830719,minutes from now we are we are likely to  hear uh from the rebel faction also  which is going to speak in guwahati but
RAiQNQCISbA,6830719,6838320,the bigger story is that what we are  being told is that more mlas have gone  from mumbai to surat surat there at a
RAiQNQCISbA,6838320,6846520,resort from surah they'll be coming to  guwahati or have they already reached  there nibir what can you tell us
RAiQNQCISbA,6849280,6854639,we are waiting outside the radisson  gates because there is going to be a  media interaction by the dissenting
RAiQNQCISbA,6854639,6860639,analyst however there has been no  movement inside as of now for in the  last one hour because there are no cars
RAiQNQCISbA,6860639,6866639,that are coming inside there is security  here and we are soon we are going to be  invited or one of the representatives
RAiQNQCISbA,6866639,6873440,may come out here and uh you know ask us  to give a bite here so there has no be  not any movement so far in terms of any
RAiQNQCISbA,6873440,6878719,mlas coming inside the hotel however  we saw a few of the other
RAiQNQCISbA,6878719,6884800,security personnel as well as bjp  leaders in the morning coming entering  the radisson hotel in the last few hours
RAiQNQCISbA,6884800,6890560,there has no movement there is only  speculation but soon all of these will  be cleared as we are going to have an
RAiQNQCISbA,6890560,6897199,interaction with the shinde front as  well as mr shinde himself  all right ignacion de is going to speak
RAiQNQCISbA,6897199,6903119,in just another 10 minutes from now uh  so let me ask the leader from the ship  cena is there even the faintest
RAiQNQCISbA,6903119,6909040,possibility because we keep circling  back only to one question
RAiQNQCISbA,6909119,6912119,s
RAiQNQCISbA,6930960,6933840,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,6952560,6958090,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,6984000,6987000,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,6997760,7004080,that forget bjp where is bjb coming in  over here bjp has nothing to do with  what is happening it is the socialists
RAiQNQCISbA,7004080,7009440,who are asking  what happened to hindu it is the  sushiniks who are asking these emily's
RAiQNQCISbA,7009440,7014480,rebel are sushena mlas and i'm telling  you i just saw footage of pratap sarnik
RAiQNQCISbA,7014480,7022560,in the bus i don't know where it is  prathapsonlike is an mla from cena and  from thani area and pretty close to
RAiQNQCISbA,7022560,7028840,if he is in mumbai then i am telling you  his heart and everything so everything
RAiQNQCISbA,7028840,7034719,is uh  mr shinden guhati and he would be  amongst the top rung leaders who stand
RAiQNQCISbA,7034719,7040560,with shinde in the future if if the need  comes and i'm telling you honestly again
RAiQNQCISbA,7040560,7046960,and again  it would have been a very be fitting  response if utah would have resigned
RAiQNQCISbA,7046960,7052719,today and would have given  let let the ncp and congress handle it
RAiQNQCISbA,7052719,7059679,anyway the congress and ncp sidelined  themselves yesterday when cena was  battling all this all alone today when
RAiQNQCISbA,7059679,7066000,they saw  today you know as i say and as your  reporters over there outstanding you see
RAiQNQCISbA,7066000,7073040,most of the ncp employees ncp leaders  wanting to save this government can i  repeat it again and again that ncp wants
RAiQNQCISbA,7073040,7078800,this government to be there because it  is a city which is gaining the most and  talking about decay i would just take
RAiQNQCISbA,7078800,7085520,one more minute you know  uh when adam did left there was a huge  void and
RAiQNQCISbA,7085520,7091520,was the only person who could fill it  and  retain that entire thing in not just
RAiQNQCISbA,7091520,7097679,thani i don't know why we all only want  to talk about anime uh sorry a question  there's a thane-based leader his
RAiQNQCISbA,7097679,7102800,presence and you see the list of the  mlas his presence is not limited only
RAiQNQCISbA,7102800,7108560,his presence is across so many districts  of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,7111040,7114800,which are tribal belts of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,7123599,7130159,he has a lot of presence across  maharashtra  the poster coming up and with ignacio
RAiQNQCISbA,7130159,7137599,what goes is the muscle power okay it  was the big muscle power in tane in that  particular area and that muscle power
RAiQNQCISbA,7137599,7143199,would be the biggest loss that i'm  telling you now would be something  because cena is known for it and as the
RAiQNQCISbA,7143199,7149280,famous anecdote goes that it was not  shinde who during the recent elections  was there in the buses he was the man
RAiQNQCISbA,7149280,7156639,sitting in the front of the bus and  guess what that bus after the voting  very conveniently was taken to surat on
RAiQNQCISbA,7156639,7163040,monday and it's only on tuesday morning  that of the  ship saying i got to know but the big  story coming in at this moment we are
RAiQNQCISbA,7163040,7168800,learning  that today  is going to move out of the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,7168800,7173840,minister's residence and he is going to  go to mata street the traditional
RAiQNQCISbA,7173840,7180000,residence of the  family he is going to vacate the  residence of the chief minister the
RAiQNQCISbA,7180000,7186480,varsha bungalow so quite a statement  there being made almost a tiago stepping  aside saying listen
RAiQNQCISbA,7186480,7193520,for the larger interest for the greater  good if you are after power if you are  after satta if you want the cm's chair
RAiQNQCISbA,7193520,7198960,you won the cm's residence take it i am  stepping away i am going to work from
RAiQNQCISbA,7198960,7204400,mata shri he is going to vacate varsha  this is a big development in fact he had
RAiQNQCISbA,7204400,7211360,hinted at it but it almost seemed during  his speech at 7 pm when he said if the  rebels want me to move out of russia i'm
RAiQNQCISbA,7211360,7217440,going to do it now we're learning that  he indeed is going to move out of the  chief minister's residence let me go
RAiQNQCISbA,7217440,7223440,across to our colleagues who in fact are  on the ground aruni and shivani are both  live with us
RAiQNQCISbA,7223440,7228320,it's confirmed he's actually going to do  it and why is he doing it
RAiQNQCISbA,7236239,7239239,shivani
RAiQNQCISbA,7241679,7247199,well here talking about this uh  particular development then our sources  within the party are telling us that
RAiQNQCISbA,7247199,7254960,after the particular meeting those are  going at the versa official residence of  cm of the presently he will be shifting
RAiQNQCISbA,7254960,7262480,to his personal residence  bhatushi in bandra earlier also we saw  that even in during uh kovid times also
RAiQNQCISbA,7262480,7268880,he was there with his family at his  personal residence but later was shifted  to russia bungalow and also what we are
RAiQNQCISbA,7268880,7274080,seeing in fact in that particular life  that he started post 5 35 p.m he also
RAiQNQCISbA,7274080,7279520,mentioned that he has no greed uh for  any of those thing and of power or any
RAiQNQCISbA,7279520,7286800,luxury and that is why you know he's all  said to give everything to susan those  are asking for it and that is why we see
RAiQNQCISbA,7286800,7292880,that this significant movement if  happens in case if  the chakra shifts from versa uh to
RAiQNQCISbA,7292880,7299199,matushri again then of course it will be  one more emotional move  from the for the shift endings for the
RAiQNQCISbA,7299199,7305119,mlas those are still not in his code all  right uh i'm going to take a very very  quick break at this point we're also
RAiQNQCISbA,7305119,7310239,getting in more news ajit pawar has  called for a meeting of all lcp mlas  tomorrow we are likely to hear from
RAiQNQCISbA,7310239,7317119,ignacinda in guwahati in just a while  from now so the developments keep going  many thought that finally uddhav is
RAiQNQCISbA,7317119,7322880,going to throw in the towel that is not  happening but what is going to happen  we'll come back with that big update in
RAiQNQCISbA,7322880,7325840,a minute don't go anywhere
RAiQNQCISbA,7333760,7339599,the ship cena they're camping they're  under the leader rahul and good evening  to all my esteemed panelists tanvir bhai
RAiQNQCISbA,7339599,7345599,is a very dear friend and i hope he  won't interrupt me  or mind my saying this that if tomorrow

RAiQNQCISbA,7354239,7362159,i am astonished when he says  that you know he is telling you that  rahul an able defense force officer
RAiQNQCISbA,7362159,7368320,becomes  able only after seven to eight years so  he means to say  that our three chiefs
RAiQNQCISbA,7368320,7373440,of the armed forces do not know  knows
RAiQNQCISbA,7377280,7382719,um  but you know and the other thing rahul
RAiQNQCISbA,7382719,7390480,have the other day i gave you seven  reasons why i support agni and they're  all logical and rational reason but one  thing that people have to keep in mind a
RAiQNQCISbA,7390480,7396800,is what they they all can be used to  bjp's advantage  and how is that with stazad
RAiQNQCISbA,7396800,7407989,haven't we seen it  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,7420159,7427119,hello and welcome you are watching the  nation wants to know with me partner  yoshi the big question that the entire  nation wants an answer to what is going
RAiQNQCISbA,7427119,7434800,to happen in maharashtra  going to stay chief minister for the  remaining term that he has for the next
RAiQNQCISbA,7434800,7441360,two years seven pm is when uddhav  thakuray spoke after that many expected  that he may just step down that is not
RAiQNQCISbA,7441360,7448480,happening he gave that speech he said  come and speak to me he reached out to  the rebels said there was never any
RAiQNQCISbA,7448480,7455280,compromise with hindu my son just went  to ayodhya he did puja over there i  spoke about insider assembly but
RAiQNQCISbA,7455280,7461199,when it comes to breaking up his  alliance with the ncp and the congress  he remains silent on that the top five
RAiQNQCISbA,7461199,7466480,developments at this point at 7 00 pm  very shortly eight night shinde is in
RAiQNQCISbA,7466480,7471840,fact going to reveal his game plan is he  going to react to the outreach of uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,7471840,7477119,takri udav takre is on all likelihood  going to vacate his varsha residence but
RAiQNQCISbA,7477119,7483760,before we take you through all of the  developments let's listen in to what  would have said to the rebels and to his
RAiQNQCISbA,7483760,7486719,own constituents
RAiQNQCISbA,7491599,7493840,at
RAiQNQCISbA,7583360,7589840,okay so what is happening at this moment  is going to speak in just a while from  now the has already said that he is
RAiQNQCISbA,7589840,7595599,going to vacate his varsha residence the  chief minister's official residence and  he is going to move to mato shree with
RAiQNQCISbA,7595599,7601760,the rest of the takarai family shahrukh  kawar and supriya sulay are currently at  the chief minister's residence davindra
RAiQNQCISbA,7601760,7608960,for device has also been in a huddle  with senior leaders of the party he also  could be speaking or maybe not because
RAiQNQCISbA,7608960,7614000,the bjp has so far decided to remain  non-committal three more mlas of the
RAiQNQCISbA,7614000,7620480,ship cena meanwhile are on their way to  guwahati they have gone to surat we'll
RAiQNQCISbA,7620480,7627679,just play those pictures of their  vehicles which were at a resort in surat  and from there they are going to take a
RAiQNQCISbA,7627679,7634079,chartered flight to guwahati  onwards to join the other 34 actually 33
RAiQNQCISbA,7634079,7639199,mlas let's explain to you the math at  this point the last figure that we have
RAiQNQCISbA,7639199,7644639,is of the letter the resolution that was  signed by emily's of the shivsena who
RAiQNQCISbA,7644639,7650400,have turned bhagi and in that letter  they said that we do not accept anyone
RAiQNQCISbA,7650400,7655599,but not shinde as the leader of the  legislative council he also have said
RAiQNQCISbA,7655599,7660639,that we refuse the whip that has been  issued against us so 34 signatures were
RAiQNQCISbA,7660639,7667040,there of those 34  signature number three which is nitin  deshmook today afternoon turned up in
RAiQNQCISbA,7667040,7675599,mumbai and said well i was kidnapped and  taken to guwahati now i have come home i  am uddhav takrez senec the ultimatum
RAiQNQCISbA,7675599,7680960,that was issued to the rebels basically  said at 5 pm you have to turn up at
RAiQNQCISbA,7680960,7686239,varsha we are having a meeting of all of  our mlas if you are not there then we
RAiQNQCISbA,7686239,7692159,will take action against you and you  will automatically be considered to be  out of the shiv sena you will cease to
RAiQNQCISbA,7692159,7697360,be shiv senecks they in turn wrote back  and said we consider this whip illegal
RAiQNQCISbA,7697360,7703760,you do not even have the authority to  call yourself the real chef cena because  we have the majority numbers that being
RAiQNQCISbA,7703760,7711440,said let's get an update now from our  reporters who are on the ground  things right now are extremely confusing
RAiQNQCISbA,7711440,7716639,let's be very honest nobody knows  who's thinking what so let's try and
RAiQNQCISbA,7716639,7723679,make sense of this aruni and radhika are  both with us from mumbai nibiru is  joining us from guwahati nibir i'll
RAiQNQCISbA,7723679,7729440,start with you  after uddhav thakri spoke  have the number of
RAiQNQCISbA,7729440,7736000,rebels  in guwahati gone up gone down or  remained the same
RAiQNQCISbA,7739360,7745360,so we are getting to know as per sources  that two escort cars are heading towards  the radisson blue hotel and in those
RAiQNQCISbA,7745360,7751840,cars there are mlas that are coming from  surah to goahati so firstly that is a  major development the cars are expected
RAiQNQCISbA,7751840,7759199,to reach the hotel within few minutes  and secondly there is another ambiguity  here right now because ignat shinde who
RAiQNQCISbA,7759199,7766320,was supposed to give a  press briefing is now has has no it has  not yet started and there are now
RAiQNQCISbA,7766320,7771440,there is now saying that there is going  to be a bite there is going to be there  going to be a media interaction where
RAiQNQCISbA,7771440,7777040,they might come out of the hotel and  they might be present at the hotel gate  and give a bite to the media so the
RAiQNQCISbA,7777040,7782320,press me that was about to help might be  helping  you there's action happening behind
RAiQNQCISbA,7782320,7789040,radhika over to you what's happening  uh that's right girish mahajan one of
RAiQNQCISbA,7789040,7794079,the bjp mlas has also entered the  video's residence so since morning uh
RAiQNQCISbA,7794079,7801040,you know as far as bjp is concerned  series of meetings taking place inside  the vender farm's residence several mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,7801040,7807440,inside several party leaders inside uh  including ashi shellar mangal prabhat  loda and now of course girish mahajan
RAiQNQCISbA,7807440,7814800,also going in so many mlas have been  walking in and out several bjp leaders  have been going inside uh since this
RAiQNQCISbA,7814800,7820719,morning so as far as  you know bjp move is concerned yes there  is a wait and watch happening they don't
RAiQNQCISbA,7820719,7825840,want a repeat of  uh what happened two and a half years  ago where they didn't have the numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,7825840,7831760,yet they went ahead they jumped the gun  and went away they don't want to do that  at this point they're waiting for that
RAiQNQCISbA,7831760,7837199,for the numbers of course we are talking  about as aruni also had been pointing  out 33 is the number we are talking
RAiQNQCISbA,7837199,7844400,about but 37 is the number that ekna  needs at the moment um so that
RAiQNQCISbA,7844400,7850560,you know there is no disqualification  that happens once that 37 number is  reached is when
RAiQNQCISbA,7850560,7856920,perhaps an alliance can be thought of  which is what bjp is
RAiQNQCISbA,7860000,7866960,that in this letter also there lies a  story a total of 34 signatures are there
RAiQNQCISbA,7866960,7873280,but if you take a close look over here  it's not just about number three which  is nitin deshmukh who has since returned
RAiQNQCISbA,7873280,7878960,to mumbai but it is also number 31 and  34
RAiQNQCISbA,7878960,7886560,who are actually independent mlas so  from the letter you might think that  there are 34 mlas who are in the eikna
RAiQNQCISbA,7886560,7894480,cindy camp right now of the shiv cena  but that is not true actually if we were  to do the math out of these 34 right now
RAiQNQCISbA,7894480,7900239,with aknac shinde there are only 31  nathan deshmook has gone back and two of
RAiQNQCISbA,7900239,7907599,them are actually independent mlas so 31  does not in any way help them clear that
RAiQNQCISbA,7907599,7914079,mark to skip the anti-defection law but  that is a bridge which ignacinda is
RAiQNQCISbA,7914079,7920960,still to come to  leave alone cross it because first there  will have to be a confidence mode will
RAiQNQCISbA,7920960,7926239,the bjp move a no confidence motion  let's go across to aruni and try and get
RAiQNQCISbA,7926239,7934440,answers to that aruni is there a  likelihood that there could be now a no  confidence motion
RAiQNQCISbA,7942400,7948079,to reach the magical figure of 37 mlas  now in that letter as well if you look
RAiQNQCISbA,7948079,7954480,at it closely as you were pointing out  earlier as well that  the bhandara mla he is an independent
RAiQNQCISbA,7954480,7961840,mla the 34 number mla that is rajendra  patil he is also again an independent  mla these two are independent mlas who
RAiQNQCISbA,7961840,7968000,have given their support to the shifts  in however their vote within the ship  cena party as per the anti-defection law
RAiQNQCISbA,7968000,7974880,that really doesn't count and the mla uh  who has been slaughtered at the third  number he has already returned to
RAiQNQCISbA,7974880,7981119,maharashtra he has spoken against ikna  shinde and the entire camp basically  saying that he was threatened over there
RAiQNQCISbA,7981119,7989199,he was forcefully hospitalized in the  city of surat as well and he escaped  from the clutches of ignacinda so yes it
RAiQNQCISbA,7989199,7995599,is it may be looking very easy it may be  presented to us that it is very easy for  akras in the ignacio they may be
RAiQNQCISbA,7995599,8000800,claiming that he has support of 40 mlas  but where are those 40 mlas on the
RAiQNQCISbA,8000800,8008000,document yes he has maximum number of  mlas if we compare that with cm with the  tatara's number only 16 were present
RAiQNQCISbA,8008000,8014480,over here many of them may be  non-committal many of them may have  reached cm of the attack race camp later
RAiQNQCISbA,8014480,8020800,on but  ikna shinde needs to have that magical  figure of 37 only after that devendra
RAiQNQCISbA,8020800,8025920,navis and bjp can go ahead with their  plan only after that they can basically
RAiQNQCISbA,8025920,8032960,swing into action one can say and they  are basically waiting for that magical  figure of 37 mlas to avoid that
RAiQNQCISbA,8032960,8038239,anti-defection law  okay let me go across quickly to our  guest sanjeev who is a political analyst
RAiQNQCISbA,8038239,8043280,joining us along with kailash adikari md  governance now sundar balakrishnan  political analyst mohit bajaj
RAiQNQCISbA,8043280,8048719,spokesperson of shiv sena yeshwan  deshmukh founder of sea voter to who i  want to ask the first question does it
RAiQNQCISbA,8048719,8053760,not seem strange to you yashwanji that  the maximum people right now who are
RAiQNQCISbA,8053760,8059840,meeting with  in this moment of crisis are actually of  the ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,8060000,8066239,well  that's that's largely understood because  i have been saying this all along
RAiQNQCISbA,8066239,8071760,nothing in maharashtra you know moves  without at least information or classic
RAiQNQCISbA,8071760,8078719,understanding of  gentleman called sharapawa  and forget about 31 even if three
RAiQNQCISbA,8078719,8084400,shinsena mlas resign the number of  shivsanic mlas will come down below the
RAiQNQCISbA,8084400,8089760,number of families of ncp and the chief  ministerial post will go to ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,8089760,8097840,so are we looking at the big picture  here forget about 31 and 37 30 is a very  big number you know uh 37 is a
RAiQNQCISbA,8097840,8103599,is a is the magic number to look into  the legalities as far as the mandate is
RAiQNQCISbA,8103599,8110560,concerned i genuinely believe that  [Music]  udder factory has kind of lost that
RAiQNQCISbA,8110560,8116079,particular part  while unable to  keep his flock together and that was
RAiQNQCISbA,8116079,8123040,largely because  you know he got the mandate along with  the bjp to appease the big congress and
RAiQNQCISbA,8123040,8129599,against the nct so uh it didn't go down  well uh it's understandable but out of
RAiQNQCISbA,8129599,8135599,this entire fiasco  if even if five people go down even five
RAiQNQCISbA,8135599,8142639,people resign  the ncp is the default gainer out of it  so  either ways no matter how many come back
RAiQNQCISbA,8142639,8148239,no matter if 37 go or not at 37 go and  they form the real shifts in on the
RAiQNQCISbA,8148239,8156000,floor of the house legally uh as the  ships in a parliamentary  the party on the assembly you know uh on
RAiQNQCISbA,8156000,8162239,on the floor of the assembly then  obviously things are very easy for the  pdf to form the government uh david from
RAiQNQCISbA,8162239,8168159,might become the chief minister okay  they might become the deputy chief  minister but the similar thing the other
RAiQNQCISbA,8168159,8174560,way around if they all  if they are unable to do that even five  people go down is the game
RAiQNQCISbA,8174560,8180800,so interesting  actually the the core issue right now  still remains the math will continue to
RAiQNQCISbA,8180800,8187760,change perhaps evolve over the next few  days but sunday balakrishnan the mandate  the moral authority
RAiQNQCISbA,8187760,8193598,that udate had  that's gone  yeah
RAiQNQCISbA,8193598,8200000,i'll tell you i don't know how much  you're aware of uh  you know after the mlc election
RAiQNQCISbA,8200000,8206080,uh there was a bus which took the mla to  uh you know surah
RAiQNQCISbA,8206080,8212240,and as far as my understanding goes  either of these mlas are from bunch of
RAiQNQCISbA,8212240,8217438,them are from the north  and the marathon
RAiQNQCISbA,8217518,8220800,now they were told
RAiQNQCISbA,8230960,8238638,which is put by a responsible media  house where  it was seen that the mlas have been
RAiQNQCISbA,8238638,8245760,literally  transferred from surah to the bus  to the chat
RAiQNQCISbA,8245760,8249200,like an animal being
RAiQNQCISbA,8251678,8258719,my question to you was about  about the moral authority to stay in  office you have so far given me a
RAiQNQCISbA,8258719,8265120,sequence of events which i already know  given a certificate of responsible or  not responsible media house but what is
RAiQNQCISbA,8265120,8270240,your answer to my question does  ray still have moral authority
RAiQNQCISbA,8270240,8276960,yeah yeah answer i'm coming to that  apartment  let me just say the answer
RAiQNQCISbA,8279500,8282610,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,8289439,8296800,this person it's not shinde he's going  to call track on his face  and  he will come back if he well when that
RAiQNQCISbA,8296800,8302719,happens we will report it but does  uttara  have the moral authority to be in office
RAiQNQCISbA,8302719,8304880,no
RAiQNQCISbA,8345040,8352478,on the figures and numbers but i'll i'll  touch something about ideological  differences ikna shinde has a towering
RAiQNQCISbA,8352478,8357760,stature as far as the politics of shifts  and is concerned you know what happened
RAiQNQCISbA,8357760,8364960,he was the  first person who joined with shift  sena's  initiation when when he started
RAiQNQCISbA,8364960,8371200,initially with baltha crates and  dharaviranan and he was the one of the
RAiQNQCISbA,8371200,8376558,very active member in those days so he  won continuously for mle elections he
RAiQNQCISbA,8376558,8382800,was minister for twice so now in number  of mlas we forget about figures it will
RAiQNQCISbA,8382800,8390319,change continuously a lot of ambiguity  is there but undoubtedly nothing has  been removed has been out of uh i think
RAiQNQCISbA,8390319,8395359,in that control of uddhav  right moral village on practical grounds
RAiQNQCISbA,8395359,8401120,whatsoever he has given in the press  conference also he is going to mature
RAiQNQCISbA,8401120,8408479,he was going towards mata shri leaving  the cm house speaks volume about now  everything is not there so nothing is in
RAiQNQCISbA,8408479,8416240,his hand now  the remote is definitely in the hand of  the  shinde so now it speaks now what what's
RAiQNQCISbA,8416240,8422160,going on with the ncp  what he's doing over there okay remote  is in the hands off
RAiQNQCISbA,8422160,8427760,bajaj if already  mr thakrei is willing to leave the house
RAiQNQCISbA,8427760,8431720,why can't he leave the office
RAiQNQCISbA,8435120,8440560,okay  basically  why he's not leaving the office because
RAiQNQCISbA,8440560,8447920,it's not  only his decision he is saying that it's  a collective decision of all the mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,8447920,8453439,okay so uh before also they selected the  particular cm so if they are having any
RAiQNQCISbA,8453439,8460000,confusion they can come in front and  they can tell whatever the issue is if  the issue it it can conclude with some
RAiQNQCISbA,8460000,8464000,sort of resolution then it is okay
RAiQNQCISbA,8465280,8471720,why wasn't he made cm to begin with why  was  he made the chief minister
RAiQNQCISbA,8473439,8480720,uh if if if he thinks so so he can come  in front of uttar tagraji  he can he can uh uh take all the
RAiQNQCISbA,8480720,8487120,particular mls with him and he can come  in front of him no issue  the phone
RAiQNQCISbA,8496080,8500960,no it's not the concept of begging  already
RAiQNQCISbA,8502080,8509520,already if they're having any confusion  right now it's 31 months crossed if he  is having any issue in the initial
RAiQNQCISbA,8509520,8516399,month or initial so why he should sign  that is the biggest question and i i  want to highlight two things the first
RAiQNQCISbA,8516399,8522000,thing that uh uh honorable the cm of  maharashtra right now uh or the takariji
RAiQNQCISbA,8522000,8528800,is coveted positive he found covet  positive even though he's uh giving the  positive response even though he's like
RAiQNQCISbA,8528800,8534319,uh industrial so mesh he is requesting  the mlas to come in front
RAiQNQCISbA,8534319,8541439,sanjaya has a question for you then why  is meeting if he's positive then why  he's destroying the protocol of kovid
RAiQNQCISbA,8541439,8547760,also meeting the most powerful person  who takes everything in his hand okay  we're breaking we're breaking some news
RAiQNQCISbA,8547760,8555520,right now the big news coming in is that  is going to offer the chief minister's  seat to  aikna shinde it was quite clear from his
RAiQNQCISbA,8555520,8560960,uh address also earlier apparently  there's going to be a former proposal  now and in fact more is being discussed
RAiQNQCISbA,8560960,8568438,in that meeting between him  and supriya sulei yes arunil filazar
RAiQNQCISbA,8577280,8585359,taking place at varsha which is the  official residence of syria mudakre and  how to exactly pacify uh the disgruntled
RAiQNQCISbA,8585359,8591680,leader that is  that is the main point of discussion  whether more portfolios can be given to
RAiQNQCISbA,8591680,8598880,him whether in fact the cm post can also  be offered to him so that the  disgruntled mlas the rebel mlas come
RAiQNQCISbA,8598880,8604080,back to the fold of asia without all  these possibilities are being discussed
RAiQNQCISbA,8604080,8613640,about till now because if you look at it  the entire fight between ikna shinde and  between uh these ships in our supreme
RAiQNQCISbA,8616319,8622000,supporters have been saying they were  very vocal about it that akrashinde  deserved to be the cm of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,8622000,8628880,because he had the support of the mlas  during uh the when the mlas were being  kept in different hotels before the
RAiQNQCISbA,8628880,8634960,mahabhikas agari alliance was formed it  was ekta shinde who had taken the  leadership he was in contact with the
RAiQNQCISbA,8634960,8641200,mlas he had kind of collected  do you think that ignac will or should  take a seat being offered to him like
RAiQNQCISbA,8641200,8646399,this  any authority will not work no it will  not work simply not work because you see
RAiQNQCISbA,8646399,8652720,the core problem is not who is the cm or  who is getting what ministry the core
RAiQNQCISbA,8652720,8658640,problem of the people coming out of  shivshana is they do not want to be seen
RAiQNQCISbA,8658640,8666399,in the same bracket as the congress and  the ncp the core problem is that they  feel their political ideology or the
RAiQNQCISbA,8666399,8674160,ideology of hindutva or their core dna  is not fit with the alliance with ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,8674160,8679280,and the congress that's their main  problem and ignacion becoming chief
RAiQNQCISbA,8679280,8686319,minister along with the congress and the  mcp support how exactly is going that  going to solve the problem exactly and
RAiQNQCISbA,8686319,8692000,that is the elephant in the room that  curiously or rather very obviously udav
RAiQNQCISbA,8692000,8699200,refused to address it is not about who  gets to be cm it is about who gets to be
RAiQNQCISbA,8699200,8706800,the  powerful the most powerful people who  are dictating the terms and  they saying i do not want sharat pavar
RAiQNQCISbA,8706800,8711840,or sunya gandhi or rahul gandhi telling  me how to run my government or telling
RAiQNQCISbA,8711840,8719120,me how to function now again ultimately  it all boils down to this the numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,8719120,8725680,and where they stand right now  31 mlas of the shift cena out of 56 that
RAiQNQCISbA,8725680,8730960,is what ekna chinder realistically has  with him in guwahati right now there are
RAiQNQCISbA,8730960,8736960,about two independents and one person  who has already returned five mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,8736960,8742720,remain non-committal mlas in the uddhav  camp are anywhere in the region of 16 to
RAiQNQCISbA,8742720,8747920,18 but definitely  less than 20  so
RAiQNQCISbA,8747920,8754080,you have a situation where uddhav does  not have the numbers but then neither
RAiQNQCISbA,8754080,8760319,does eknath shinde  to  escape the anti-defection law but
RAiQNQCISbA,8760319,8766399,remember that anti-defection law will  kick in only later for starters there
RAiQNQCISbA,8766399,8772640,has to be a no confidence vote  whoever  whichever party whichever side has to
RAiQNQCISbA,8772640,8777840,actually prove that they enjoy the  confidence of the house and that will
RAiQNQCISbA,8777840,8782720,remain step number one want it
RAiQNQCISbA,8782960,8789520,okay  do you know to answer that question of  the fact that uh the ideological which
RAiQNQCISbA,8789520,8794800,was just open  uh before me now this has to be then  thought three years ago we are three
RAiQNQCISbA,8794800,8801040,years into the government but and for  for a person like me who has from the  state of maharashtra i feel sorry you
RAiQNQCISbA,8801040,8807120,know to see all this and as a citizen uh  of maharashtra it pains me that if any  governance
RAiQNQCISbA,8807120,8814080,mishap or failure happens because of  such kind of political instability  everyone who has voted wants for some  kind of political stability now whether
RAiQNQCISbA,8814080,8820240,mr ignac shinde will go with the bjp or  he's feeling some ideological problem  here then we are three years down the
RAiQNQCISbA,8820240,8826560,government it's hardly known now to two  more years left was this the opportunity  time to do it or was this is the time
RAiQNQCISbA,8826560,8833920,that he could get the 32 mls now this is  what the ships and i have to internally  decide now whether the honorable chief  minister has lost the most
RAiQNQCISbA,8833920,8839280,the trust of of the public or not that's  a separate question no one has asked the  public it's not a referendum now whether
RAiQNQCISbA,8839280,8846240,he has not lost uh the trust of the  ships and sweden that will only come to  know when mr ignac shindeen govati has
RAiQNQCISbA,8846240,8851359,37 numbers and that  vote of no confidence can can be moved
RAiQNQCISbA,8851359,8857760,by the bgp when that magical number  strikes all right uh we have to take a  very quick break at this point but what
RAiQNQCISbA,8857760,8864960,we are also learning now of the meeting  that is coming that is going on between  the ncp top brass and uh
RAiQNQCISbA,8864960,8871439,at varsha is that the meeting is over  and what shahrukh pavar has told rudav  takre is is that you send a proposal to
RAiQNQCISbA,8871439,8877120,eight not shinde tell him i am willing  to make you mukhimantri i'm willing to  make you chief minister shahrukh pawar
RAiQNQCISbA,8877120,8884399,has now left the chief minister's  residence and there is a possibility of  the rejig in portfolios as well but this
RAiQNQCISbA,8884399,8889439,could very well be like putting a  band-aid on a cancer the real problem is
RAiQNQCISbA,8889439,8894960,not about the chief minister's office at  all the real problem is much bigger and
RAiQNQCISbA,8894960,8900399,will uddhav  be willing to address  that problem that these rebels have now
RAiQNQCISbA,8900399,8907200,flagged taking a very quick break but  like we said  eikna cindy is now going to reveal his
RAiQNQCISbA,8907200,8912439,cards what is he going to say we'll tell  you in a minute
RAiQNQCISbA,8923660,8931610,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,8932000,8939040,opposition's president general robert  said this is not a monrega employment  guarantee scheme and b the armed forces
RAiQNQCISbA,8939040,8945120,are well within their rights as is every  organization  to have a two-step or a three-step or a
RAiQNQCISbA,8945120,8952000,four-step selection process they want  the best of the best  if 100 people have been inducted the
RAiQNQCISbA,8952000,8958000,defense forces are within their rights  to say that look out of these 100 we  have trained them for four years and now
RAiQNQCISbA,8958000,8963280,the time has come for the second rung in  the selection process we want only 25
RAiQNQCISbA,8963280,8970160,who are the best of the best among these  hundreds and the 75  there are ample opportunities for them
RAiQNQCISbA,8970160,8976720,they have earned money they want respect  they're only 21 to 22 they are going to  absorb in a lot of other ancillary
RAiQNQCISbA,8976720,8981920,forces but  can i please come back to the topic  because i don't want to uh you know
RAiQNQCISbA,8981920,8987760,my time to be eaten away in rebutting in  entities rahul the fact of the matter is
RAiQNQCISbA,8987760,8996318,that in trying to usher in any new  reform  the modi government is literally now  having to mohawk on agni path
RAiQNQCISbA,9002399,9008880,but this is to be expected remember  when the opposition can orchestrate  absolute mayhem and outrage over the
RAiQNQCISbA,9008880,9015359,farm reforms that they had promised in  their own manifestos  what chance do those reforms have that
RAiQNQCISbA,9015359,9021600,aren't in their manifestos  it is very unfortunate that the  excellent agni-v scheme is being mocked
RAiQNQCISbA,9021600,9028800,by the congress by uttering inanities  like if you wish to train as a barber or  a washer man then become an agni has to
RAiQNQCISbA,9028800,9034160,be said though bjp of course is mulling  a strategy as to what happens next and
RAiQNQCISbA,9034160,9039840,what we are picking up from our sources  is that it's a strategy to try and oust  the agari sir card in fact details which
RAiQNQCISbA,9039840,9045840,are now emerging exclusively here on  times now what we are picking up is that  cena is likely to skip the opposition
RAiQNQCISbA,9045840,9053439,meeting that's just one of the many uh  details which are coming in in fact bjp  mla has also reached the surat resort
RAiQNQCISbA,9053439,9060640,that's what we are picking up and that  is huge because we just spoke to one of  the bjp mla they said that they have not
RAiQNQCISbA,9060640,9066479,been in touch with any of the rebels who  are there in surat and now already a  super scoop coming in
RAiQNQCISbA,9066479,9072479,that bjp mla has arrived there at the  surat resort let me go across to ahmed  rajpur who is joining us
RAiQNQCISbA,9072479,9075279,rajput bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,9082319,9085319,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,9094470,9097600,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,9151840,9154840,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,9164880,9167880,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,9212399,9215399,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,9227600,9235359,non-stop breaking inputs times now  accesses uh visuals from inside the  meeting the key meeting between uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,9235359,9241120,supriya sulei we are being told has just  got over and the big takeaway poonam
RAiQNQCISbA,9241120,9247920,from that meeting is that uh a plan is  now in place  by the two major agardi partners and the
RAiQNQCISbA,9247920,9254640,plan is to pluck it  shinde  right we're given to understand that the  chief minister's position could also be
RAiQNQCISbA,9254640,9259760,offered to him to placate him and bring  him back to the fold that's one of the  things that was discussed in this
RAiQNQCISbA,9259760,9267120,particular meeting and it's interesting  pranesh because uh even when uh  uddhav came out and said that if you ask
RAiQNQCISbA,9267120,9272160,me to resign i'm ready to do so but i  want the next chief minister to also be  from the shift cena so that is still
RAiQNQCISbA,9272160,9278880,something that could be on the cards  even as far as uh  their two alliance partners are  concerned absolutely let's get in aruni
RAiQNQCISbA,9278880,9283960,here arun the meeting is over what are  you picking up
RAiQNQCISbA,9286000,9292399,well that is right a big development  coming in from the official residence of  syria muda takaris for close to an hour
RAiQNQCISbA,9292399,9298960,uh the crucial meeting between saratovar  as well as his ncp gang one can
RAiQNQCISbA,9325359,9333110,m  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,9340420,9343590,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,9366000,9372800,this was on the cards there is no  coordination between the three aghadi  allies and the government is bound to
RAiQNQCISbA,9372800,9377040,fail the bjp has no role aruni
RAiQNQCISbA,9380399,9387439,well that is right bjp will only jump  into the fray after ikna shinde has the  requisite numbers again i am repeating
RAiQNQCISbA,9387439,9394399,pranesh that it doesn't look like at  least on the paper that ikna shinde has  the magical number of 37 we were
RAiQNQCISbA,9394399,9400960,pointing towards the fact that 34 mlas  had signed that ships in a letter  however one nitin deshmukh has already
RAiQNQCISbA,9400960,9407520,returned to the state of parashat he has  been speaking against ikna shinde camp  now whereas there are three mlas now who
RAiQNQCISbA,9407520,9412560,are exactly independent mlas so they  stand in the ship sena party when ekta
RAiQNQCISbA,9412560,9418240,shinde camp has to defeat the  anti-defection law their vote is not
RAiQNQCISbA,9418240,9425920,going to matter over here so whether  ikna shinde has that magical number of  37 when he has that then only devendra
RAiQNQCISbA,9425920,9431920,fandavis or the bjp can do something  about it but yet yes it is true that  iknow
RAiQNQCISbA,9431920,9437600,shindex camp has more mlas than cm  so on moral authority or on moral
RAiQNQCISbA,9437600,9444399,responsibility whether cmu takaray can  continue as the cm of maharashtra  because it these are his own soldiers
RAiQNQCISbA,9444399,9449680,these are his own party it was an  emotional appeal that he tried to make  where he said nothing could be more
RAiQNQCISbA,9449680,9455200,disheartening than the betrayal of my  own people i'd like to call them my own  don't know if they think so uh is the
RAiQNQCISbA,9455200,9462080,sentiment he tried to portray now he  also said  that he would be shifting out of his  official residence varsha to back to
RAiQNQCISbA,9462080,9468000,mata shri after this particular meeting  is over that meeting is now over are you  hearing anything any developments on the
RAiQNQCISbA,9468000,9472399,front of him actually moving residences
RAiQNQCISbA,9475760,9481280,well well on that front we we still need  to get some uh confirmation from uh the
RAiQNQCISbA,9481280,9486640,ships in a  close confidence of him without hatred  however he did mention about it that
RAiQNQCISbA,9486640,9492319,since my party himalayas have left me i  am very willing and ready to placate
RAiQNQCISbA,9492319,9498800,my official residence that is varsha i  am very happy to operate from matu shri  as well and if ikna shinde and his men
RAiQNQCISbA,9498800,9506160,come to me directly not calling a  question this follow us as his men as my  men just hold your thoughts also joining
RAiQNQCISbA,9506160,9508800,us from outside
RAiQNQCISbA,9512560,9515760,he says wait and watch
RAiQNQCISbA,9519359,9524479,absolutely so we just spoke to rausa  dunway while uh exiting uh they went to
RAiQNQCISbA,9524479,9531200,part of his residence and what he has  said is that  we knew that this government is going to  fall uh we knew that this is gone not
RAiQNQCISbA,9531200,9536319,gonna stick around that is something  that we've been retreating for the last  so many years but we are on a wait and
RAiQNQCISbA,9536319,9542000,watch more so that is what bjp is  currently  the status of bjp is currently they are
RAiQNQCISbA,9542000,9548319,waiting and watching they do not want a  repeat of what happened two and a half  years ago when this entire uh ajit pawar
RAiQNQCISbA,9548319,9553680,partners  episode took place whereby partners had  to resign soon because he didn't have
RAiQNQCISbA,9553680,9558960,the numbers they don't want a similar  episode happening now which is why bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,9558960,9564880,is being very cautious lesser than that  going to um down to and that is
RAiQNQCISbA,9564880,9571439,something that the bjp is also watching  uh out for from the sidelines as of now  as the unit majors also came out and
RAiQNQCISbA,9571439,9576800,said but arundel as far as the numbers  go now a letter was put out by uh iknow
RAiQNQCISbA,9576800,9584240,shinde and the rebel camp there were 34  signatures on that but all those 34  people are not or shiv cena mlas many of
RAiQNQCISbA,9584240,9589280,them are independent so he really does  not have the support of 34 uh shifts in
RAiQNQCISbA,9589280,9595200,our mla so it is going to be difficult  for him to to  defend or steer clear of the
RAiQNQCISbA,9595200,9598080,anti-defection law
RAiQNQCISbA,9600800,9607280,well that is right poonam in fact the  anti-defection number or the magical  number for ignace in this camp will be
RAiQNQCISbA,9607280,9615040,37 over here they will have to reach the  number of 37 to defeat or to avoid the  anti-defection law yes 34 mlas indeed
RAiQNQCISbA,9615040,9621200,signed that letter from the eclash in  the camp but three were independent from  that one was rajkumar patel who was
RAiQNQCISbA,9621200,9626479,basically from bachchuk  a prahar sakti party but his name was  not mentioned over there because he is
RAiQNQCISbA,9626479,9632160,the leader of the party but his other  mla's name was mentioned over there and  there are two other mlas one is from
RAiQNQCISbA,9632160,9639040,bandara and one is another mla who's  whose name is also there so three  independent mla and the third in the
RAiQNQCISbA,9639040,9645120,list was mr nitin deshmukh he has  returned to maharashtra and he's been  speaking against ikna shinde now so the
RAiQNQCISbA,9645120,9650880,exact number with ikna shinde at is 30  their cap may be claiming that more mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,9650880,9658560,are joining them expected to join them  but with the ships and also getting very  over over here keeping their mlas in a
RAiQNQCISbA,9658560,9664399,hotel counting  contacting their uh mlas why are  different routes making those emotional
RAiQNQCISbA,9664399,9670560,appeals we also saw how aditya and  several close confidants of shifts
RAiQNQCISbA,9670720,9676399,coming in this is a big breaking input  coming in breaking first on times now  now some people who are in touch with
RAiQNQCISbA,9676399,9682080,the shinde camp  are telling times now that the reason  that shinde's press conference is
RAiQNQCISbA,9682080,9687359,delayed because hindi is waiting for two  to three more sena rebels who are on
RAiQNQCISbA,9687359,9694080,route to the hotel they have landed in  guwahati we are being told and any  moment they will get into this hotel
RAiQNQCISbA,9694080,9699479,after which shinde will be addressing  the press conference radhika
RAiQNQCISbA,9712479,9717760,radhika if you can hear me what are you  picking up because maharashtra bjp chief  chandra khan
RAiQNQCISbA,9717760,9723359,is accompanying these cena rebels from  surah to gohati
RAiQNQCISbA,9725920,9733840,yes absolutely that's what we are  hearing the chandra khan battle is being  accompanied by  some more rebel mlas if that is the case
RAiQNQCISbA,9733840,9739359,then perhaps  that uh magic number of 37 if you know
RAiQNQCISbA,9739359,9746000,he is with cena mlas as is being said  but we'll have to wait and see as far as  you know when when we interacted with
RAiQNQCISbA,9746000,9751359,many of these bjp leaders as well as  the mlas from a bjp they've been saying
RAiQNQCISbA,9751359,9757200,that we'll wait and watch we know that  this government is going to fall we will  look at the numbers as of now absolutely
RAiQNQCISbA,9757200,9762880,no uh interaction with the you know uh  with anybody from the government no talk
RAiQNQCISbA,9762880,9768880,of uh you know an alliance a formation  as of now so await and watch more
RAiQNQCISbA,9768880,9774240,this afternoon he too was non-committal  as far as alliance with uh the bjp is  concerned pranay and it's interesting
RAiQNQCISbA,9774240,9779760,because it's not just the bjp that is  playing the wait and watch game it's all  stakeholders in this entire game and
RAiQNQCISbA,9779760,9786240,nibir now joins us from guwahati where  the action has now shifted because it's  not just those 34 mlas nibir who are at
RAiQNQCISbA,9786240,9791520,that hotel we're given to understand  that three more have now landed there
RAiQNQCISbA,9794640,9800800,yes indeed there are reports that the  mlas have landed in guate airport and  they are soon about to reach the
RAiQNQCISbA,9800800,9806640,radisson blue hotel where the other  descending mlh are  launched since the morning and the ml is
RAiQNQCISbA,9806640,9812160,soon about to reach here they already we  have seen two escort vehicles coming  from the airport and they are coming
RAiQNQCISbA,9812160,9818560,here within the redis and blue hotel  however the press interaction that was  scheduled at 7 00 pm has been postponed
RAiQNQCISbA,9818560,9825600,and there has been no update on that  whether there is going to be a press  conference or whether there is going to  be a brief media interaction by
RAiQNQCISbA,9825600,9831760,ignacinda other than that we are getting  to know that few of the mlas will be  soon joining the dissenting mlas that
RAiQNQCISbA,9831760,9838240,are camping here since morning  right so is the strength of the rebel
RAiQNQCISbA,9838240,9845680,camp going to increase uh  the ignacinde camp would like us to  believe he is talking about 40 plus mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,9845680,9850880,he said that to us this afternoon as  well listening to that exclusive  conversation we had with eknar cindy who
RAiQNQCISbA,9850880,9854960,right now seems to be holding all the  cards
RAiQNQCISbA,9856319,9861520,we'll try and get you that reaction of  ignacion there which is the times  network exclusive in which he told us
RAiQNQCISbA,9861520,9870960,how he has the support of several  independents and uh  over 30 mlas of the shiv cena the uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,9870960,9878000,knows they do not have the numbers at  least shiv cena does not but he is  playing a victim card he's trying to put
RAiQNQCISbA,9878000,9883040,up a brave face he says i will not give  up my position until and unless these
RAiQNQCISbA,9883040,9889760,rebels come directly to me and talk to  me these kind of tricks are not going to  make me give up the position or the
RAiQNQCISbA,9889760,9897561,government but listening to what it  nachin they had to tell the times  network  my time
RAiQNQCISbA,9916880,9919880,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,9937520,9940520,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,10006479,10009479,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,10037279,10043520,now that the pressure is also delayed  how should one be reading this
RAiQNQCISbA,10047279,10054160,well if if it comes to delaying of press  conference then the interaction of  cmudot was also delayed by a close to
RAiQNQCISbA,10054160,10060720,half an hour  so but yes what ignacion they will be  revealing or diverging in this press  conference that basically will decide
RAiQNQCISbA,10060720,10068960,the feud not only the future of mahavika  sagari government but probably also of  the shifts and apartheid the same shift
RAiQNQCISbA,10072960,10079278,the basically the strings of that party  were given to ud  rather than
RAiQNQCISbA,10079520,10086080,also made one interesting point that we  have faced these kind of hindrances or  problems or difficulties earlier as well
RAiQNQCISbA,10086080,10093359,several ships in our leaders have left  them in the past be it narayan  left with 23 mlas at that time he said
RAiQNQCISbA,10093359,10099680,but we still sailed through and we are  going to fight back and immediately came  a tweet from sanjay route as well that
RAiQNQCISbA,10099680,10106720,we are going to fight however the  crucial point is that whether ignacinde  has those crucial has those magical 37
RAiQNQCISbA,10106720,10113200,numbers with him at this point going by  the numbers or going by the document  that he has said it seems like he has 30
RAiQNQCISbA,10113200,10119680,mlas with him at present if he gets  those 37 numbers  because a big breaking input coming in
RAiQNQCISbA,10119680,10126720,now sources are close to shinde camp are  telling times now and this is important  big breaking input on times now that
RAiQNQCISbA,10126720,10132319,shinde has denied the offer made by the  aghadi  of cm post
RAiQNQCISbA,10132319,10139040,there is no compromise here says the  shinde camp at least that's the  indication
RAiQNQCISbA,10143279,10149760,well that is right information crucial  information significant development  coming in uh from the ignacinde camp
RAiQNQCISbA,10149760,10156720,over here basically denying uh the cm  post however whether it was formally  offered to him also or no that is also
RAiQNQCISbA,10156720,10162080,again a point of question because  after we look at it uh the kind of  discussion that had taken place
RAiQNQCISbA,10162080,10167200,yesterday between cmu and ignacion  they accepted that there was a call from
RAiQNQCISbA,10167200,10172720,cmu  steam the discussion was about hindutva  the discussion discussion was about how
RAiQNQCISbA,10172720,10178479,hindutva was primarily compromised and  hands were shaken with the arch nemesis
RAiQNQCISbA,10178479,10185520,of abal today that is the congress and  the ncp in in the letter that ikna  shinde today sent to the deputy speaker
RAiQNQCISbA,10185520,10191279,in that letter also he had mentioned  about the fact that how corruption was  being done by the alliance partners of
RAiQNQCISbA,10191279,10198080,the ship senate basically two ncp  ministers are in jail at present so he  didn't really wanted to continue with
RAiQNQCISbA,10198080,10204560,the congress and the ncp so if such kind  of a letter has been written by ignacion  they so how can he continue uh with the
RAiQNQCISbA,10204560,10211040,same alliance partners that is the  congress and the ncp and be at their  head be be their head basically be the
RAiQNQCISbA,10211040,10216800,cm of that government so yes uh uh  ignacinde denying the cm post uh is very
RAiQNQCISbA,10216800,10222319,much on the expected lines because he  has already said that he had hated the  fact that cm
RAiQNQCISbA,10222319,10229439,had joined hands with the congress and  the incident right and they mentioned  that in the resolution as well that it  was really the compromise on ideals that
RAiQNQCISbA,10229439,10236000,they have a problem with not really with  urdhav takre but the fact that they  decided to join ranks with uh the ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,10236000,10242640,and the congress is something that they  cannot deal with anymore it's been two  and a half years but that cannot  continue now nibir it's interesting that
RAiQNQCISbA,10242640,10247760,the bjp both at the central level and in  maharashtra is for now watching from the
RAiQNQCISbA,10247760,10256439,sidelines but where the action is  happening in guwahati we did see some  bjp mlas walk in there
RAiQNQCISbA,10271840,10277840,that was the reaction coming in uh after  the meeting i believe between sharat  pavar and uttav
RAiQNQCISbA,10277840,10284560,members of those two parties but  our reporters continue to be with us  before i get you in let's listen into
RAiQNQCISbA,10284560,10291760,one of the  reportedly rebel mlas who now says that  he was taken to guwahati
RAiQNQCISbA,10291760,10297200,really by the shinde camp he's now come  back to safety and he'll always stand  with ud
RAiQNQCISbA,10297200,10299601,listening
RAiQNQCISbA,10303359,10306359,to
RAiQNQCISbA,10318720,10321720,hospital
RAiQNQCISbA,10333680,10335840,like
RAiQNQCISbA,10361200,10369840,we are given to understand that the  three more sena rebels could enter the  hotel and shinde will start his briefing
RAiQNQCISbA,10373439,10379520,yes the briefing that was supposed to be  held at 7 00 pm was has been delayed  there are no in further information
RAiQNQCISbA,10379520,10385920,regarding whether there will be a  briefing or a press meet however the uh  the more mlas are set to join the
RAiQNQCISbA,10385920,10391200,radisson blue hotel they have already uh  reached the airport landed at the  guwahati airport and they are about to
RAiQNQCISbA,10391200,10397200,reach the uh radisson blue hotel and  that will lead to the more numbers of  dissenting mlas here joining the
RAiQNQCISbA,10397200,10403840,radisson blue hotel here in guwahati  it's since morning as you can see it has  been a roller coaster ride here the the
RAiQNQCISbA,10403840,10409600,descending amelies  arrived in the ghati airport they came  directly here at the radisson blue and
RAiQNQCISbA,10409600,10415520,they had a series of high level meetings  here since the morning and now we are  getting to know that there are more mls
RAiQNQCISbA,10415520,10422640,that are joining the descending mlas  that furthers the show of strength the  show of strength that eight night shinde
RAiQNQCISbA,10422640,10428640,had displayed since yesterday when from  surah the dissenting mls came here to  goahati
RAiQNQCISbA,10428640,10435520,and now more and more mlas are joining  their ranks  from surah let's go back to aruni in
RAiQNQCISbA,10435520,10441680,mumbai arundel big news coming in after  the meeting at patna vis residence we  have been told that the bjp has asked
RAiQNQCISbA,10441680,10446520,all its mlas to be present in mumbai
RAiQNQCISbA,10459120,10464880,basically speaking to the media  he has shut the window of his car but
RAiQNQCISbA,10464880,10470680,nana patali has come over here to meet  and to give out
RAiQNQCISbA,10479000,10482700,[Music]

RAiQNQCISbA,10505600,10510720,trio has been completed one can say and  coming to your question with respect to
RAiQNQCISbA,10510720,10518000,bjp mla is being called in uh the bjp  mlas are saying that they're awaiting a  call from the party leadership till now
RAiQNQCISbA,10518000,10523279,a formal call has not been made but from  the bjp maharashtra hierarchy we
RAiQNQCISbA,10523279,10529200,understand that  by tonight a call will be made to all  the mlas to be in the city of mumbai or
RAiQNQCISbA,10529200,10536080,in the vicinity  in development because for now uh the  bjp says that we are going to be  adopting a wait and watch approach but
RAiQNQCISbA,10536080,10542479,is there a change in strategy now that  their mlas have been summoned to mumbai  from wait and watch have they now moved
RAiQNQCISbA,10542479,10548160,to battle ready mode that's something  that we'll have to uh look at nibir  continues to be with us uh also getting
RAiQNQCISbA,10548160,10554240,us the very latest as far as the hectic  meetings that are happening in mumbai  it's not just the shift cena and the
RAiQNQCISbA,10554240,10559479,agari partners the bjp 2 was in a huddle
RAiQNQCISbA,10571760,10576880,we'll try and get you those reactions  coming in after the meeting concluded  between the akhadi partners udav takrei
RAiQNQCISbA,10576880,10583279,left chartpower's residence where the  meeting was happening he did say he was  going to give up his official chief  minister's residence and move back to
RAiQNQCISbA,10583279,10588640,matoshri right after this meeting is  over that's something to also watch out  for and times now is going to be getting
RAiQNQCISbA,10588640,10596560,you the very latest from on ground in  mumbai there but handing over to editor  and chief rauschenker for india upfront
RAiQNQCISbA,10597920,10607120,thanks indeed punam thanks indeed yes  viewers on india upfront the big story  as it unfolds across maharashtra and of
RAiQNQCISbA,10607120,10612399,course three other states  this has been  one
RAiQNQCISbA,10612399,10618960,very very busy day  viewers one very very busy day
RAiQNQCISbA,10618960,10625720,but unfortunately  the situation in maharashtra  has assumed
RAiQNQCISbA,10625720,10630960,simultaneously the contours  of a fast and a tragedy
RAiQNQCISbA,10630960,10638319,are fast because uddhav takri thinks  he can speak on behalf of the people of
RAiQNQCISbA,10638319,10644640,maharashtra  when a vast majority of his own mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,10644640,10651760,have not just stopped trusting him  but have long stopped listening to him
RAiQNQCISbA,10651760,10657200,in fact they are so far  out of your shot that they're enclosed
RAiQNQCISbA,10657200,10663040,in a hotel in guwahati  and you can see those pictures
RAiQNQCISbA,10663040,10668800,to the left of your screens  they're all lining up for group photos
RAiQNQCISbA,10668800,10674000,it's a fast  because uddhav takre who knows
RAiQNQCISbA,10674000,10679920,who has read the writing on the wall  who knows that his end has come
RAiQNQCISbA,10679920,10685439,has moved out  of varsha's official residence
RAiQNQCISbA,10685439,10692560,to matoshri his family home  and in one fell swoop conveniently he's
RAiQNQCISbA,10692560,10699439,conflated  viewers  the interests of the state with his own
RAiQNQCISbA,10699439,10706240,private interest  viewers  he is not even living
RAiQNQCISbA,10706240,10712399,anymore  in the official accommodation allotted  to him
RAiQNQCISbA,10712399,10718640,and he's doing it because as i told you  he has also seen those pictures
RAiQNQCISbA,10718640,10723760,30 plus mlas of his  caught on camera
RAiQNQCISbA,10723760,10729760,signing documents a resolution saying  that they do not believe anymore
RAiQNQCISbA,10729760,10737120,in the integrity  of their own leader  and their chief minister
RAiQNQCISbA,10737120,10742399,the numbers viewers and i'm going to  pull up those numbers and i'm going to  talk you through some of those numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,10742399,10749520,those numbers tell the entire story the  cena rebels in guwahati are 30 plus
RAiQNQCISbA,10749520,10758560,sena mlas or root to assam to gohati are  two mlas in uddhav camp are only 16
RAiQNQCISbA,10758560,10766479,and that two viewers might be an  optimistic number  mlas who are non-committal are five
RAiQNQCISbA,10766479,10773840,the mlas that are needed to break the  cena 37  all it takes to break the cena is 37 and
RAiQNQCISbA,10773840,10781520,not attract the anti-defection law just  do the match 32 plus 2 plus 5 that takes
RAiQNQCISbA,10781520,10788080,you much beyond  37  and even if you was  someone were to tell you
RAiQNQCISbA,10788080,10794800,that those cena rebels also include five  or seven  independents
RAiQNQCISbA,10794800,10800720,even then viewers  it's a near thing  it's a near thing because
RAiQNQCISbA,10800720,10807439,more than 30 mlas out of 55 not in your  pocket  militating against you
RAiQNQCISbA,10807439,10813680,criticizing you  not recognizing you as their legitimate  leader is a vast number
RAiQNQCISbA,10813680,10818880,it's a vast number of viewers  and that hardly
RAiQNQCISbA,10818880,10825520,hardly  can be taken  as a sign of confidence
RAiQNQCISbA,10825520,10830800,now  think about it viewers  if mr thakure's own loyalists don't
RAiQNQCISbA,10830800,10836479,think he's up to the job  then how can we the people who elected  him to serve us
RAiQNQCISbA,10836479,10843359,trust his capacities  but despite this  but despite this uddhav tagray eagerly
RAiQNQCISbA,10843359,10848800,clings to power  mocking the mandate  and
RAiQNQCISbA,10848800,10856080,and political morality  viewers  by defending the indefensible which is
RAiQNQCISbA,10856080,10860880,his continuance in office listening
RAiQNQCISbA,10912800,10919600,let's go straight across and get to the  latest because  in a dramatic move in a dramatic move
RAiQNQCISbA,10919600,10925279,just a few moments back uddhav  offered the chief minister's post to the
RAiQNQCISbA,10925279,10930560,rebel leader  eknar shinde  shinde is expected to speak any moment
RAiQNQCISbA,10930560,10937200,now to the media clearly this is an  attempt to preempt that clearly it's an  attempt viewers
RAiQNQCISbA,10937200,10943359,to bribe him clearly viewers  uddhav takari believes that the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,10943359,10950439,minister's post  is his to parcel around
RAiQNQCISbA,10951040,10956560,like it is some  incentive
RAiQNQCISbA,10957279,10963760,clearly he doesn't think it's a  privilege  a privilege that is handed
RAiQNQCISbA,10963760,10971279,by trusting  voters  a privileged post from where you serve
RAiQNQCISbA,10971279,10976800,the state and not yourself  look at how much
RAiQNQCISbA,10976800,10983760,in his mind  the warping is between  what he believes today
RAiQNQCISbA,10983760,10990160,is his right  and what he believes today viewers is in  the interest
RAiQNQCISbA,10990160,10996880,of the right thing to be doing i want to  go straight across  to some of our reporters aruni coming to
RAiQNQCISbA,10996880,11002800,you first this offer that has been made  by uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,11002800,11010080,where is this come from  why is he making this offer right now  what's the logic
RAiQNQCISbA,11013279,11019520,well rau let me tell you the reason why  ikna shinde's press conference has been  delayed now is because there have been
RAiQNQCISbA,11019520,11026080,series of calls that have been made from  the close confidence of cmu  to the people of iknocks and they
RAiQNQCISbA,11026080,11031120,basically giving him multiple offers a  slew of offers have been provided to him
RAiQNQCISbA,11031120,11037040,this after the one hour meeting that  took place between character  and asean
RAiQNQCISbA,11037040,11043760,and basically the mainly the crux of the  meeting that took place between these  two leaders of the mahabharata was how
RAiQNQCISbA,11043760,11049040,ikna shinde can be pacified what can we  offer uh ignacindi and the discussion
RAiQNQCISbA,11049040,11054640,about offering him the cm post was also  a part of uh the the discussion that
RAiQNQCISbA,11054640,11061279,took place over there but ikna shinde as  we see saw his letter in the morning he  basically clearly
RAiQNQCISbA,11061279,11066560,spoke against the mahabharata government  spoke against the congress and the ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,11066560,11071600,saying that he was against this alliance  the way congress and ncp have uh have
RAiQNQCISbA,11071600,11078240,have made shift senate and syria muda  taken to compromise on  on hindutva he was completely against
RAiQNQCISbA,11078240,11085040,this and his rebel mlas basically the  mlas who have gone with him they also  feel that a hindutvadhi shivsena should
RAiQNQCISbA,11085040,11090640,be initiated  on this front and that's why the delay  has been coming in from iknack in this
RAiQNQCISbA,11090640,11096960,front right now at cm  nana patoli has gone over there  maharashtra congress chief so after the
RAiQNQCISbA,11096960,11102399,ncp the congress also reaching out to cm  without re okay let me uh bring in nibir
RAiQNQCISbA,11102399,11109600,once before i go across to padmaja nibir  you have of course been reporting  outside of that guwhati hotel
RAiQNQCISbA,11109600,11115760,now why is eiknath shinde not coming out  and responding in clear terms to dav
RAiQNQCISbA,11115760,11122000,takre who says that i want you to come  to me  say what you have to say to me face to
RAiQNQCISbA,11122000,11128920,face  and if you still believe that i need to  quit i will go
RAiQNQCISbA,11132240,11137920,yes indeed there is much deliberation  going in the mind of eknar shinde  because he had said that he is going to
RAiQNQCISbA,11137920,11144240,meet the media at 7 00 pm and then he  delayed it and now there are no  information further whether they are
RAiQNQCISbA,11144240,11150560,going to meet the press so there is much  deliberation going in the mind of ignat  shinde but one thing has been clear that
RAiQNQCISbA,11150560,11157040,he has displayed his stance since  yesterday when he arrived in guate has  been very clear he has displayed his
RAiQNQCISbA,11157040,11163600,stand and he has not bowed down and that  is what he has that's why the show of  strength that was evident today at the
RAiQNQCISbA,11163600,11169840,hotel was in full display when the  dissenting mlas came here they came with  the slogans jay maharashtra they were in
RAiQNQCISbA,11169840,11175840,full swing when they entered the  hotel and now we also got to know that  two more mls are also joining the rank
RAiQNQCISbA,11175840,11182160,so their show of strength continues  although there is a lack of amid a lack  of clarity whether he is going to meet
RAiQNQCISbA,11182160,11188640,the media because there is definitely  much deliberation going in the mind of  possibly also he knows that he might be
RAiQNQCISbA,11188640,11194080,two or three short still of that magic  number he needs to avoid  the uh
RAiQNQCISbA,11194080,11199840,clause  that would lead to the disqualification  of the entire faction so maybe that's
RAiQNQCISbA,11199840,11205600,something that he's waiting for there  are some mlas on root but  what did you make of
RAiQNQCISbA,11205600,11212160,uttav takri's address to the state  do you believe that uddhav has answered  his doubters
RAiQNQCISbA,11212160,11217359,did he make a strong case  for have to continue in office actually
RAiQNQCISbA,11217359,11222640,all that uddha  said left one major question the  elephant in the room completely
RAiQNQCISbA,11222640,11230399,unaddressed and that was spelt out in  black and white in the letter that had  been sent by the rebels from guwahati
RAiQNQCISbA,11230399,11236960,this letter actually holds the key when  udopte said you should come and talk to  me tell me what you want
RAiQNQCISbA,11236960,11242640,the rebels in the letter have already  told him what they want and let me  quickly point out three main points from
RAiQNQCISbA,11242640,11248319,this letter right at the end they say  that our leader bala
RAiQNQCISbA,11248319,11254479,was a strong nationalist we have been  subjected to lot of criticism for being  part of this corrupt maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,11254479,11262160,government so you are saying essentially  that ekna chin they come and be chief  minister ignacinde is not arguing right
RAiQNQCISbA,11262160,11269040,now about who is to be chief minister he  is saying i do not want to be none of us  want to be a part of this government the
RAiQNQCISbA,11269040,11275439,problem is the government and why is it  a problem here is where they spell it  out they say there is enormous
RAiQNQCISbA,11275439,11282160,discontent among carder of our party for  forming government with ncp and national  congress who are ideologically opposed
RAiQNQCISbA,11282160,11289600,to shiv cena there has been a compromise  of principles of shiv cena which is a  party with fierce ideological base also
RAiQNQCISbA,11289600,11296880,there is great dissatisfaction among the  cadre on account of corruption in the  government regarding police posting by
RAiQNQCISbA,11296880,11304000,anil deshmukh and nawab malik so you are  trying to put a band-aid on a cancer and
RAiQNQCISbA,11304000,11310560,the cancer here is spelt out as the  agari itself the coalition is the cancer
RAiQNQCISbA,11310560,11316720,according to the rebels  well thanks indeed i'll come out to you  radhika in just a few moments viewers i
RAiQNQCISbA,11316720,11324160,began by situating for you the reasons  why  the entire events that are unfolding in
RAiQNQCISbA,11324160,11330080,maharashtra are fast  but they're also a tragedy  because today there is virtually no
RAiQNQCISbA,11330080,11336160,government in maharashtra emilia is from  the ruling party in guwahati they've  taken up residence there as if they were
RAiQNQCISbA,11336160,11341680,elected to serve the people of assam  they spent two nights
RAiQNQCISbA,11341680,11348800,in surat  as if they were more interested  in serving the people of gujarat
RAiQNQCISbA,11348800,11355200,those that have stayed behind to proper  buddha are so busy trying to ensure that  they can hang on to their own mla ships
RAiQNQCISbA,11355200,11360800,that they are least concerned with the  welfare of the citizens  even the opposition in the shape of the
RAiQNQCISbA,11360800,11367359,bjp the mlas are distracted by dreams of  sweeping back to power  the public's welfare is the least of
RAiQNQCISbA,11367359,11374000,their priorities or concerns  this is the people's  maharashtrian
RAiQNQCISbA,11374000,11381279,people's great misfortune  india is at a crossroads economically  one wrong step and it can all go south
RAiQNQCISbA,11381279,11388399,at a time like this it is vital that  india's financial and industrial hub is  governed in an exemplary manner
RAiQNQCISbA,11388399,11395439,the last thing maharashtra in india  needs is a lame duck chief minister who  is destined to lurch from crisis to
RAiQNQCISbA,11395439,11402319,crisis a few hard facts will put into  perspective why maharashtra's economic  health holds the key to india's growth
RAiQNQCISbA,11402319,11407760,story 38 of india's direct tax  collections come from maharashtra 14.2
RAiQNQCISbA,11407760,11414399,percent of higher share  national gdp rupees 3.84 lakh crores
RAiQNQCISbA,11414399,11421680,direct tax by residents and corporates  32  total tax collection from mumbai alone
RAiQNQCISbA,11421680,11428640,mumbai is the 16th most expensive  property market in the world  fifty six thousand dollar millionaire
RAiQNQCISbA,11428640,11434720,households in maharashtra the highest in  india number one most urbanized state in  the country
RAiQNQCISbA,11434720,11440640,it's interlocked  with india's economic fortunes  and i'm going to open up this debate
RAiQNQCISbA,11440640,11447200,because  from fast to tragedy it's all playing  out  and the questions go straight to the
RAiQNQCISbA,11447200,11453520,shift center first  this evening and i want to go straight  to sahaja yoga there are also of course

RAiQNQCISbA,11471600,11478640,supariwala the question is you don't  have the mandate you don't have the  trust of your own mlas yet you cling to
RAiQNQCISbA,11478640,11484000,power  has  lost the moral right to rule it's a
RAiQNQCISbA,11484000,11486960,simple question
RAiQNQCISbA,11489840,11495600,first of all my sahib  shri  balasa
RAiQNQCISbA,11495600,11502720,has never been greedy for power he has  had all the powers he needed from the  time he was born till the time he's
RAiQNQCISbA,11502720,11508080,become a seer  today also he's as powerful  he does not
RAiQNQCISbA,11508080,11514000,greet for power does not crave for power  he's a king maker he had been selected
RAiQNQCISbA,11514000,11520399,and he was the choice for the cm only to  save maharashtra from dirty politics
RAiQNQCISbA,11520399,11526239,first of all  all i can say is this dirty games which  are going on on greed
RAiQNQCISbA,11526239,11532000,on the indifferences  on  misunderstandings is really say very
RAiQNQCISbA,11532000,11537600,very sad state of affairs today  maharashtra state is really under
RAiQNQCISbA,11537600,11542960,unnecessary turmoil which has been  created by some  reasons
RAiQNQCISbA,11542960,11548560,unknown to all of you and me as well  the reason of
RAiQNQCISbA,11548560,11553720,deserting  those

RAiQNQCISbA,11567600,11573600,as well as here  on your tv on the media i also claim the  same whether
RAiQNQCISbA,11573600,11579680,cm is a very small thing for sri uddevas  bala takri he is the cena chief and
RAiQNQCISbA,11579680,11584720,nobody else all i can say is that i have  just tweeted we do not
RAiQNQCISbA,11584720,11590399,agree with that and you don't know that  in our hearts  in our hearts

RAiQNQCISbA,11631680,11638479,yeah sure that was  waived viewers was by mla pratak sanaik
RAiQNQCISbA,11638479,11643600,who wrote to uddhav to join the bjp in  june 2021
RAiQNQCISbA,11643600,11649279,few days back  pleaded to end the alliance for the sake  of hindutva we are still not
RAiQNQCISbA,11649279,11655359,talking about  ekna shinde the person who has cobbled  together
RAiQNQCISbA,11655359,11662720,this uh  bunch of shiv sena rebels we are only  still talking about mla pratap sanayak
RAiQNQCISbA,11662720,11671359,he says end it  save hindu  red flag 2 21st august 2021 bjp narayan

RAiQNQCISbA,11678960,11685359,touch with the opposition shinde was  named as an mla in touch with the  opposition
RAiQNQCISbA,11685359,11692640,red flag 4 8th june rs polls  bjp 1 due to cena congress cross voting
RAiQNQCISbA,11692640,11699359,it was clear  that there was a rebellion  brewing in the ranks
RAiQNQCISbA,11699359,11704479,20th june mlc polls bjp won  its five seats due to cross voting it
RAiQNQCISbA,11704479,11709840,was not supposed to win five  red flag six around 35 mlas left
RAiQNQCISbA,11709840,11715760,maharashtra for gujarat but the state  government  looked the other way
RAiQNQCISbA,11715760,11721040,viewers  the signs were there you only had to
RAiQNQCISbA,11721040,11726720,listen  mr supariwala how can you say you don't  know the letter that has been written to
RAiQNQCISbA,11726720,11732000,you by the rebels says that you relished  on your promises you have betrayed the
RAiQNQCISbA,11732000,11735640,legacy of balthakray
RAiQNQCISbA,11738080,11743920,where were they since the time the  government has formed why that only  recently they have started writing all
RAiQNQCISbA,11743920,11749680,this  secondly my other ques my other answer  and reply to your questions are that
RAiQNQCISbA,11749680,11755279,first of all  whoever has written letters only the 35  mlas cannot decide
RAiQNQCISbA,11755279,11761200,the running of the state government it  is a coil it is a government which is  called mahavika zakhari there are
RAiQNQCISbA,11761200,11766800,certain things  you cannot jump from here to there and  be an opportunities my sahib is not an
RAiQNQCISbA,11766800,11773040,opportunist he has been loyal with whom  ever he contested with the bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,11773040,11776160,he dumps the bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,11779040,11785200,please let me complete it otherwise it's  futile asking me a question  if you do not let me speak rahul i will
RAiQNQCISbA,11785200,11790640,not be able to explain i want to be very  calm and cool and explain so that we  both can understand what we are talking
RAiQNQCISbA,11790640,11795840,about i gave you time to ask me a  question right please let me reply if  you feel it is wrong or it is
RAiQNQCISbA,11795840,11801200,indifferent we can always debate on it  okay  the thing is
RAiQNQCISbA,11801200,11806960,that that thing is that why the senate  did not form a government with the bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,11806960,11812080,because  it they had promised  something which everybody knows 2.5
RAiQNQCISbA,11812080,11819920,years of each chief minister of each  other parties now what happened was that  promise wasn't kept and bala sayab's
RAiQNQCISbA,11819920,11825680,principles are there in urdu everybody  knows that i do not need to know as a  senior today the whole maharashtra has
RAiQNQCISbA,11825680,11831600,seen i've got thousands of people from  other parties also praising  though there are political differences
RAiQNQCISbA,11831600,11840080,but being an opposition does not mean  that you can slander people okay or you  can say that hindu has not been followed
RAiQNQCISbA,11840080,11846801,has never said that we will leave  or we will not do anything about it just  recently
RAiQNQCISbA,11849920,11855920,has been doing so many things for all  the religions let me be complete not  only muslims okay hindus christians we
RAiQNQCISbA,11855920,11860840,have heard  he gave us his resume
RAiQNQCISbA,11869680,11876160,you can't just keep on and on dominating  and talking talking and talking you made  your point you understood you said that
RAiQNQCISbA,11876160,11882560,you haven't betrayed him  talking i've understood sir let's not  talk about the legs i need five seconds
RAiQNQCISbA,11882560,11889920,of the other panelists it's okay just  give us 30 seconds seconds  i need i need five seconds
RAiQNQCISbA,11889920,11895279,you're giving me 30 seconds okay good  what i'm saying is  just being
RAiQNQCISbA,11895279,11901520,uh inclusive with all the religion and  taking them into confidence and doing  their work as well as the work of the
RAiQNQCISbA,11901520,11906800,hindu tour does it make you a less hindu  never i think every religion teaches
RAiQNQCISbA,11906800,11914319,tolerance every teacher religion teaches  how to make people happy how to govern  them how to rule them this is the
RAiQNQCISbA,11914319,11919520,law of every religion right we are all  same blood we are all same skin we all
RAiQNQCISbA,11919520,11925359,agree why didn't do religion cast greed  we all agree with you sir no doubt about  this okay now that you finished your
RAiQNQCISbA,11925359,11932000,long biggest religion now that you've  told us why you made the switch let me  tell you since you involved okay mr
RAiQNQCISbA,11932000,11938000,supari 30 seconds up now you invoke  balthakari i haven't invoked him and i  just want to remind you viewers when
RAiQNQCISbA,11938000,11944080,they said that they made the switch  from the bjp because the bjp did not  promise or live up to their promise of
RAiQNQCISbA,11944080,11950000,rotating the chief ministership  okay  so then they go and embrace the ncp and
RAiQNQCISbA,11950000,11958319,the congress of course they're not  opportunists  but what did balthakray have to say  about the ncp of course if bjp he said
RAiQNQCISbA,11958319,11964160,and this was in 1998 baltacry said if  bjp befriend sharat pavar we will end
RAiQNQCISbA,11964160,11970880,the alliance  for him sharat pawar  was the poison ivy
RAiQNQCISbA,11970880,11976000,we will end the alliance we came into  power by riding an anti-power wave
RAiQNQCISbA,11976000,11981840,don't want power or power  it's a party of principles
RAiQNQCISbA,11981840,11989520,so if today  udav  takare is standing with mr pawar
RAiQNQCISbA,11989600,11995439,has he betrayed  his father's legacy that's a fundamental  question i'll leave it to you viewers to
RAiQNQCISbA,11995439,12000720,judge that those are baltac reviews i  want to bring in i want to bring in mr
RAiQNQCISbA,12000720,12008319,anand dr ranganathan what do you make of  what the shift sanik is saying today

RAiQNQCISbA,12014800,12018960,something one second dr ranganathan yes  go ahead
RAiQNQCISbA,12021120,12027439,yes good evening rahul and good evening  to all my fellow panelists i hope you  would give me  a fraction of the time you have given to
RAiQNQCISbA,12027439,12033120,my good friend mr supariwala and i hope  what i say would not be interrupted by  him
RAiQNQCISbA,12033120,12039920,rahul as they say  history repeats itself  first as a tragedy and then as a farce
RAiQNQCISbA,12039920,12045840,what is unfolding before us today and  yesterday is a total farce
RAiQNQCISbA,12045840,12052880,but what happened three years ago  was an absolute tragedy  i say this unequivocally the mahavika
RAiQNQCISbA,12052880,12060399,sagari government never had the people's  mandate period  it was a government by convenience for
RAiQNQCISbA,12060399,12067760,convenience of convenience and when you  betray the people's mandate it always  ends up like this let me explain we
RAiQNQCISbA,12067760,12073359,always knew the shift cena was never  good at chemistry  now we know they are not good at maths
RAiQNQCISbA,12073359,12079840,as well  are you calling it unlawful  i never interrupted you
RAiQNQCISbA,12079840,12087359,have you taken the sopari to interrupt  me please let's not let's not do this  not fair please yes please don't do it
RAiQNQCISbA,12087359,12093920,yeah  please  this is unfair  i was i i was listening to you uh you
RAiQNQCISbA,12093920,12099040,know to what you were saying although it  was painful to my ears for 10 minutes  well let me tell you
RAiQNQCISbA,12099040,12106399,let's maintain the decorum  let me just tell you very quickly that  mr shinde  shinde has just tweeted saying that
RAiQNQCISbA,12106399,12113120,we want to get out of this unnatural  alliance you were talking about  convenience  here it is he's echoing you
RAiQNQCISbA,12113120,12120000,yes  yes  no absolutely it would be another tragic
RAiQNQCISbA,12120000,12127359,tragedy if mr shinde were to accept  mr udar dhakaray's offer that he become  the chief minister no the problem is not
RAiQNQCISbA,12127359,12134160,who becomes the chief minister the  problem is this mva never had the  people's mandate
RAiQNQCISbA,12134160,12140960,so let me explain now i hope i would not  be interrupted now raul is just a couple  of minutes you know the bjp garnered 105
RAiQNQCISbA,12140960,12148479,odd seats a shifts in of 56.  and the ncp congress alliance 98 and  they wanted a shift in a chief minister
RAiQNQCISbA,12148479,12154800,the bjp has 26 percent vote share shifts  in only 16. crucially it was a pre-poll
RAiQNQCISbA,12154800,12161359,alliance not a post-poll one like was  the case in karnataka recently when the  congress ceded the cm post to the jds
RAiQNQCISbA,12161359,12167120,even though the former got more seats  there another difference by the way the  jds could have allied with the bjp its
RAiQNQCISbA,12167120,12172560,people adversary and so the congress was  scared but here  what was shiv sena's game when he tried
RAiQNQCISbA,12172560,12179680,to carry favor with the ncp and  therefore the ncb congress alliance its  phone adversary if balasara were alive i
RAiQNQCISbA,12179680,12186319,am sorry he would have tweaked mr  supariwala's ears and dragged him to a  corner and made him do a murga
RAiQNQCISbA,12186319,12192640,i think it was a cataclysmic error on  the bjp's part to have a seat sharing  agreement with the shift cena a
RAiQNQCISbA,12192640,12199200,departure from 2014 by the way if you  remember this despite the fact  that the only other party that abused
RAiQNQCISbA,12199200,12206239,modi more than the congress in the last  five years for shivsena it cost the bjp  20 fewer seats and a perpetual threat of
RAiQNQCISbA,12206239,12213040,blackmail they overestimate i think the  anti-incumbency factor they should have  trusted fatnav is more he had done more
RAiQNQCISbA,12213040,12219520,than a decent job in his first term  finally a larger point  post poll alliances are immoral i repeat
RAiQNQCISbA,12219520,12225520,immoral in that they ridicule the voter  who voted against two adversaries  getting together for the sake of
RAiQNQCISbA,12225520,12232080,opportunism cena asked for votes on the  basis of ridiculing both congress and  the ncp same was the case with bjp and
RAiQNQCISbA,12232080,12238640,the same was the case with jds and  congress and bjp and jjp they fight like  cats and dogs and convince the voters
RAiQNQCISbA,12238640,12244960,that they are politically and  ideologically polar opposites and as  soon as the results come in the two  polls get sucked towards each other to
RAiQNQCISbA,12244960,12251920,form the core high time the election  commission stepped in and banned  pre-post poll alliances going forward i
RAiQNQCISbA,12251920,12258160,think it is also high time the governor  stepped in and slapped president's rule  maharashtra must go in for fresh
RAiQNQCISbA,12258160,12264080,elections there is no other option okay  let me bring in yogi
RAiQNQCISbA,12264080,12269840,when a party can trade in its own legacy  for power
RAiQNQCISbA,12269920,12276720,as your own mla's claim  not me  not shinde is tweeting right now sir
RAiQNQCISbA,12276720,12282399,and he is saying that this is an  unnatural alliance it's an unnatural  front
RAiQNQCISbA,12282399,12288319,i'm going to take a decision only in the  interest of maharashtra  going back to the ncp
RAiQNQCISbA,12288319,12294479,the shift cena  and the congress will not be in the  interest of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,12294479,12299520,so sir  can the people  trust you when your own mlas who are
RAiQNQCISbA,12299520,12304560,sitting in guwahati today  out of your reach
RAiQNQCISbA,12304560,12310319,because they think that even being in  your presence will stigmatize them
RAiQNQCISbA,12310319,12316960,when your own mla sir  yogis  are rejecting you
RAiQNQCISbA,12316960,12322560,yes can i talk can you hear me how are  you  how are you continuing
RAiQNQCISbA,12322560,12329600,to say  that the people must trust you  yes sir can you hear me yes yogi please
RAiQNQCISbA,12329600,12336800,tell us yes  why should the public then trust you
RAiQNQCISbA,12336800,12343920,yes sir i'm coming to that  and uh also what uh the  doctor anand raganathan said
RAiQNQCISbA,12343920,12349840,if you go to see sir  we'll come back  not even 2014 i would like you to take
RAiQNQCISbA,12349840,12357200,you back to 2019 february when the  alliance  of susan and bjp got back together
RAiQNQCISbA,12357200,12363840,amit shah ji  uttar ji thakrasaya announced that  susana and bjp are coming back together
RAiQNQCISbA,12363840,12368800,for the lok sabha elections  there and there itself
RAiQNQCISbA,12370000,12376880,and um they're told  it will be a 50 50 plus sharing formula
RAiQNQCISbA,12376880,12384239,right for lok sabha and for will by it  will be 50 50. lok sabha happened that  way then vidhan sabha came they put
RAiQNQCISbA,12384239,12389760,pressure  okay that time  came back to 121 or 123 seats and after
RAiQNQCISbA,12389760,12395680,that what mr anand said i would like to  tell that also unholy alliance okay
RAiQNQCISbA,12395680,12400800,before shivshana went with ncp and  congress  it was
RAiQNQCISbA,12400800,12406000,uh mr farnavis ji and ajit powerji who  took both together as chief mission uh
RAiQNQCISbA,12406000,12412000,deputy chief minister of maharashtra  after that she said  so you know listen that time did i know
RAiQNQCISbA,12412000,12418800,when bjp does it it is justified  i didn't interrupt when you were talking
RAiQNQCISbA,12418800,12425200,sorry  no because you're taking my name sir i  didn't take your name
RAiQNQCISbA,12425200,12431840,yes i i'm interrupting sir just for 10  seconds because you took my name mr yogi  please  and i'm interrupting only for telling
RAiQNQCISbA,12431840,12437359,you that since yesterday you can check  up on the same program i castigated bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,12437359,12443680,more i reminded them that on workplaces  when at 3 am in the morning they took
RAiQNQCISbA,12443680,12451279,the oath of chief minister  but even today you heard me i said even  bjp even bjp did yesterday okay i'm
RAiQNQCISbA,12451279,12458880,coming back on it uh yeah yes sir yes  sir please please no but mr gaddafi  please subscribe
RAiQNQCISbA,12459200,12463040,so when when bgp goes
RAiQNQCISbA,12464319,12471600,one second in 1998  forget the bjp the bjp even tied up with  the pdp when they tied up with the pdp
RAiQNQCISbA,12471600,12478160,sir even then you did not snap ties  with the bjp  you remember that
RAiQNQCISbA,12478160,12483200,you traded in you keep abusing the bjp  for doing the deal with the pdp
RAiQNQCISbA,12483200,12489520,but you didn't snap ties you were in  government at that time also with the  bjp in maharashtra when they're tied up
RAiQNQCISbA,12489520,12495040,with the pdp so quite clearly  when the bjp also does things which you
RAiQNQCISbA,12495040,12502000,don't agree you keep quiet because what  is it that you love most you love power  most okay so let's not fool people now i
RAiQNQCISbA,12502000,12508080,want to come back to what balthacry said  okay  bjp tied up with a breakaway element of
RAiQNQCISbA,12508080,12513279,the ncp led by ajit pawar you didn't  think that was good
RAiQNQCISbA,12513279,12520640,but your own baltacra sir  said that  pawar pavar is not someone we want to
RAiQNQCISbA,12520640,12527120,ever do business with  what are you doing with mr power today  your own chief minister
RAiQNQCISbA,12527120,12535439,said in his press conference i owe the  fact that i became chief minister to mr  power he convinced me
RAiQNQCISbA,12535439,12541680,okay sir i'm just getting back to your  point no so  wrong about mr power simple question was
RAiQNQCISbA,12541680,12546960,he wrong nineteen nineteen  did not recognize the merits of mr power
RAiQNQCISbA,12546960,12554640,is that what you're saying if you let me  talk there i will answer it  i'm i'm coming to the answer only sir
RAiQNQCISbA,12554640,12561600,hello  i'm waiting for the answer see  if you go by all these instances
RAiQNQCISbA,12561600,12567840,all political parties say something 10  20 years back or something happens later  on
RAiQNQCISbA,12568080,12574561,one minute even then because he was also  he was also an opportunist
RAiQNQCISbA,12600800,12602960,how
RAiQNQCISbA,12612000,12617160,i will never ever ever go with ncp okay
RAiQNQCISbA,12636400,12641600,[Music]  why did you compromise on your  principles that's the question that dr
RAiQNQCISbA,12641600,12646561,ranganathan is asking you that's the  question i'm asking you
RAiQNQCISbA,12646640,12653279,i'm telling you that only sir  ki if you go to see what happened in  bihar also he there
RAiQNQCISbA,12653279,12658960,uh mr nitish's party got less  mls
RAiQNQCISbA,12662790,12665839,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,12679720,12686399,[Music]  the problem is that yogi gaday
RAiQNQCISbA,12686399,12691920,and supari  are both saying because the bjp did  something wrong
RAiQNQCISbA,12691920,12698479,that allows us to also  do something wrong  against the principles of bharasapre
RAiQNQCISbA,12698479,12701119,gaday sab
RAiQNQCISbA,12704880,12710640,i don't want people speaking over me sir  one minute  he in fact mr has come out and said very
RAiQNQCISbA,12710640,12717040,clearly  said something 20 years ago who cares  this is precisely the reason why mr
RAiQNQCISbA,12717040,12724800,shinde has a problem this is precisely  why he's fracturing the shift senate  today viewers that's the real story i
RAiQNQCISbA,12724800,12730080,want to bring in senior editor of  surajar  mr gupta how do you respond political
RAiQNQCISbA,12730080,12735600,analyst mr sujatha pandey is there in  punawala is also there with us yes rahul
RAiQNQCISbA,12735600,12743920,what the people of maharashtra confused  as a jaduki japi between the ncp the  congress and the chef cena was indeed a
RAiQNQCISbA,12743920,12751520,marriage of convenience as dr anganathan  correctly points out driven by the lust  for power and greed mr supari vada says
RAiQNQCISbA,12751520,12758319,that uddaf thakra is not greedy three  emergency meetings since yesterday not  even 20 mlas have turned up take the
RAiQNQCISbA,12758319,12763760,higher moral ground resign you don't you  never had the  moral right to rule the moral right to
RAiQNQCISbA,12763760,12769920,govern it was bjp that bagged you the  seats alone  would not have been able to get 50 seats
RAiQNQCISbA,12769920,12774960,in the election that went in 2019  where is the resignation where is the
RAiQNQCISbA,12774960,12780479,moral high ground so let's not kid  ourselves by saying that the thakurays  do not have the lust for power they very
RAiQNQCISbA,12780479,12786720,clearly have that is what resulted in  the first place  in this unholy marriage of convenience
RAiQNQCISbA,12786720,12793920,the second point he says 35 mlas are not  enough to take down the government to  decide what the mahavika sagadi would do
RAiQNQCISbA,12793920,12799040,sir 35 mlas and another 2 mlas is the  difference between your party being in
RAiQNQCISbA,12799040,12807359,power and not being in power your entire  government is so fragile that all it  took was 35 mlas in the majority figure
RAiQNQCISbA,12807359,12812479,of 143  to put your government in jeopardy what  are you talking about
RAiQNQCISbA,12812479,12818479,are you not waking up and smelling the  coffee there are no mlas with uddhav  takari right now the third thing he says
RAiQNQCISbA,12818479,12826239,is chef sena is tolerant  tell me rahul which tolerant government  puts an actress behind the bus for 40
RAiQNQCISbA,12826239,12831520,days for commenting on one of the  leaders of the government which  government does that which government
RAiQNQCISbA,12831520,12838319,jails ministers and politicians for  reciting the hanuman character what kind  of hindi is this in maharashtra where
RAiQNQCISbA,12838319,12843439,people do not have the freedom to recite  the hanuman chalicer and the point  number four
RAiQNQCISbA,12843439,12850000,sanjay roth who probably thought of  himself as a chanakya back in 2019 where  is he right now probably it is him who
RAiQNQCISbA,12850000,12856399,has triggered the entire downfall of the  mahavika sagadi what do we do about that  has the shift center overplayed its hand
RAiQNQCISbA,12856399,12861439,that's the final question and lastly to  sum it all up they are evoking the
RAiQNQCISbA,12861439,12868160,memory of bayasa thakuraji at every  given opportunity  all i want is mr supariv to ask this
RAiQNQCISbA,12868160,12874880,question to himself honestly  if baala sahib fortunately was alive  today if he was alive today to witness
RAiQNQCISbA,12874880,12880239,all this would he agree to this unholy  alliance for even a second would he want
RAiQNQCISbA,12880239,12886160,uddaf  to continue as the chief minister of  maharashtra for even one second just ask
RAiQNQCISbA,12886160,12892160,that question to yourself don't answer  us ask yourself that question answer  your caddo answer the people in
RAiQNQCISbA,12892160,12898319,maharashtra who believe in the shiv sena  who continue to believe in the shift  that if fortunately if bala said
RAiQNQCISbA,12898319,12906319,takaraji was amongst us today would he  agree to this alliance  of this super ivana please respond
RAiQNQCISbA,12908000,12913439,yeah bala  after the interest of maharashtra his
RAiQNQCISbA,12913439,12918960,his some unlikeness or some uh  differences with people wasn't more more
RAiQNQCISbA,12918960,12924080,important than maharashtra he would  definitely is this fragile government in  the interest of maharashtra and to save
RAiQNQCISbA,12924080,12930239,maharashtra to save the state  if you're asking me a question my dear  let me complete no i heard everything
RAiQNQCISbA,12930239,12935760,you said  can i continue can i continue is just  answer a simple question sir is this
RAiQNQCISbA,12935760,12941920,government  we saw what happened during the pandemic  is this government in the interest of
RAiQNQCISbA,12941920,12948160,maharashtra an alliance where no party  has even 60 seats  how is it in the interest of maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,12948160,12952359,an alliance which was not voted
RAiQNQCISbA,12957040,12964359,when all it took was 35 mlas in the  majority figure of 143
RAiQNQCISbA,12974239,12980640,just look at the pictures on your screen  these are latest visuals coming from  guati none of these mlas have been moved
RAiQNQCISbA,12980640,12987279,by what uddhav takriv said today  they're all sitting there
RAiQNQCISbA,12987279,12994000,and they have decided to stay away  from the ships and no one is catching a  flight to go back to mumbai to present
RAiQNQCISbA,12994000,12999920,themselves before uddhav takre  he has no claim over them no moral
RAiQNQCISbA,12999920,13006479,authority over them he has no  no authority
RAiQNQCISbA,13006479,13014000,over them that tells you where the  situation is  even if this government survives
RAiQNQCISbA,13014000,13021040,it will be so rickety viewers  that it will not be focusing on its job  it will be focusing on survival not
RAiQNQCISbA,13021040,13026640,serving  india or indians  and that is worrying because we are
RAiQNQCISbA,13026640,13031760,talking about a state that is  instrumental and i've showed you  i've showed you the figures
RAiQNQCISbA,13031760,13037120,instrumental in propping up india's  growth story can i say something wrong
RAiQNQCISbA,13037120,13044239,you please answer  mr gupta replies  answer mr gupta please

RAiQNQCISbA,13059680,13064800,would bala takaraji if he was  fortunately alive today
RAiQNQCISbA,13075680,13082080,would have definitely been  first keeping the differences aside and  see to the interest of maharashtra you
RAiQNQCISbA,13082080,13089279,cannot this is just a hyperbolic  statement by you that would he have  actually he is not here here right now
RAiQNQCISbA,13089279,13094640,but in seoul he is there with us  he's there with us
RAiQNQCISbA,13094640,13101040,he's there with us and udo is already  doing that so your christmas  we are doing this just for the people of

RAiQNQCISbA,13144479,13151600,would have sacrificed his principles to  put maharashtra first  and he believes that this coalition
RAiQNQCISbA,13151600,13156720,whether it is  whether it is a defenses sir he is  talked about
RAiQNQCISbA,13156720,13163040,it's a party principle these are his  words not mine  i am quoting him i'm talking

RAiQNQCISbA,13192640,13198000,both uh mr saajid  and mr yogi are not going to accept the
RAiQNQCISbA,13198000,13204640,fact  that this is not the shiv sena of balasa  pakre  it's fine it's all right if they don't
RAiQNQCISbA,13204640,13210560,accept it the proof of the pudding is in  the eating it's in front of us let me  give you another stark example
RAiQNQCISbA,13210560,13216720,today or last week shift senate took the  support of ai mim  for rajya sabha membership you remember

RAiQNQCISbA,13520080,13525680,here it is  do you believe today  uddhav thakrei

RAiQNQCISbA,13549920,13556479,quick points to make point number one  i'm surprised and aghast that nobody is  discussing nitin deshmook and kailash
RAiQNQCISbA,13556479,13563359,bartle the two mlas who have escaped and  come back with nathan dishmook seeing  how there's a threat to his life i was  forcefully kidnapped he was asked to say
RAiQNQCISbA,13563359,13569120,that he got a cardiac arrest heart  attack and 400 500 policemen chasing  mlas so these visuals that you're
RAiQNQCISbA,13569120,13576319,showing could all be made up i mean  first of all these don't look like 35  they're eight nine mlas i don't believe  that 35 mlas as the honorable supreme
RAiQNQCISbA,13576319,13581840,court said the test of the test can only  happen on the floor of the house why  don't they call a no confidence motion
RAiQNQCISbA,13581840,13587600,because they don't have the numbers  except for a paper that they've made out  you will remember devon the fat nervous  that made up that paper in his early
RAiQNQCISbA,13587600,13592720,morning drama they don't have the  numbers  and the mba have a majority yet the
RAiQNQCISbA,13592720,13598720,quality of difference between mr utter  taker and davinder for novices this  devendra nova says in the floor on the
RAiQNQCISbA,13598720,13604880,floor of the house he said in marathi  i'm translating in english i am like the  waves of the sea i shall come back he's
RAiQNQCISbA,13604880,13610560,desperate to be chief minister and  today says that i don't even want to be  chief minister come become chief
RAiQNQCISbA,13610560,13617520,minister my question to the rebels is  you are number two in the cabinet in the  ships in iraq only after uddhaftakrishi
RAiQNQCISbA,13617520,13622960,what is the guarantee today that if you  are that if you form your own party you  don't have the numbers but if you
RAiQNQCISbA,13622960,13629520,hypothetically for your own party but  nervous and bjp will allow you to be  chief mr love shifting or to be cheap  minister is this fulfilling the dreams
RAiQNQCISbA,13629520,13635920,of of of uh  and you talk about late by taking the  late ball who stood for united
RAiQNQCISbA,13635920,13643199,maharashtra davinder navis is on record  saying that he wanted to dis to break up  with her from from maharashtra he spot
RAiQNQCISbA,13643199,13648640,an election to break up with that from  maharashtra they want to break up  maharashtra they want to impose hindi on
RAiQNQCISbA,13648640,13653438,maharashtra they want to make mumbai a  union territory
RAiQNQCISbA,13665040,13671040,should be given the bharatna  sir i believe that savarka's
RAiQNQCISbA,13671040,13677120,contribution should be acknowledged  whether you agree or disagree with his  witness contribution i'm asking you do
RAiQNQCISbA,13677120,13682560,you agree with rahul gandhi and the  congress party stand that said that the
RAiQNQCISbA,13682560,13687760,bharat ratna cannot be given to a coward  like veer savarkar do you agree yes or
RAiQNQCISbA,13687760,13694000,no just simple question  uh it is the congress party that removed  the stamp for
RAiQNQCISbA,13694000,13700160,congress party in indira acknowledged  him his contribution should be looked at  whether one second
RAiQNQCISbA,13700160,13705760,do you support rahul gandhi's point of  view on this it's a simple question do  you see
RAiQNQCISbA,13705760,13708960,the prime minister i'm
RAiQNQCISbA,13714479,13720880,do you support in principle three  statements that he has made about  number one veer savarkar was the divider
RAiQNQCISbA,13720880,13727439,of india divider in chief he called him  i have his tweet number two  veed savarkar is a coward
RAiQNQCISbA,13727439,13734000,number three  that we oppose  any move to give veer karda bharatna
RAiQNQCISbA,13734000,13740479,just three  aspects do you agree with any of these  statements  i think the prime minister agrees with
RAiQNQCISbA,13740479,13746160,it therefore  yes yes or no don't dodge the question  okay  don't dodge the question view is the
RAiQNQCISbA,13746160,13753359,reason i brought this up and i i believe  that sujata pandey will back me up on  this sujata pandey
RAiQNQCISbA,13753359,13758640,if i'm not mistaken what did mr bart  hakare have to say
RAiQNQCISbA,13758640,13764080,about  veesavakar  that he was a nationalist that he was a
RAiQNQCISbA,13764080,13770399,true nationalist and but rahul the the  larger question  here that we are debating is and one of
RAiQNQCISbA,13770399,13776319,the points i would like to really  mention and bring here you know it  doesn't matter whether
RAiQNQCISbA,13776319,13781920,whether this government rules or that  government rules whether without  pick up the chief or remain the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,13781920,13788560,minister or goes but you know what  matters today what matters is that the  breach of trust of people should not
RAiQNQCISbA,13788560,13796800,even the trust of the people the voters  of maharashtra should be made a mockery  it matters when when you take vote on
RAiQNQCISbA,13796800,13803920,name of something else and you do a  postful alliance just for the greed of  power it matters when when you say that
RAiQNQCISbA,13803920,13810319,you are a hindu party you are a hindu  party and you keep quiet on parker  lynching you absolutely keep word you
RAiQNQCISbA,13810319,13815760,send people to jail for asking what has  happened on it it matters rahul when so
RAiQNQCISbA,13815760,13821479,when you talk about that  party

RAiQNQCISbA,13920880,13926960,he's of course the closest adviser to  the tacrik land and he's come out and  said very clearly that uh
RAiQNQCISbA,13926960,13932800,uddhav takre has moved out of varsha  which is the chief minister's official  residence and has moved into mato shri
RAiQNQCISbA,13932800,13938319,he's also come out and said that they're  going to fight right till the end and  when the opportunity presents itself if
RAiQNQCISbA,13938319,13945040,it presents itself they will prove the  majority on the floor of the house third  most importantly that we have no lust
RAiQNQCISbA,13945040,13950239,for power we are ready to sacrifice  anything for our principles and number
RAiQNQCISbA,13950239,13957520,four never offered shinde the chief  minister's post this is fake news  four basic points made by sanjay rawat
RAiQNQCISbA,13957520,13965199,but even as he's making those points  viewers visual evidence of more shiv  sena mlas fleeing the coop
RAiQNQCISbA,13965199,13971439,and landing up in guwahati those are the  live pictures coming from guwahati i  want to bring in nibir right now in
RAiQNQCISbA,13971439,13977120,guwahati nibir the numbers now swelling  the rebel faction is growing

RAiQNQCISbA,13982239,13988399,viewers he's reporting out of uh  guwahati that hotel  where
RAiQNQCISbA,13988399,13993680,all  all the mlas who have deserted uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,13993680,14000000,takre are hold up and those pictures are  on your screens we're going to show you  the pictures of those mla sitting there
RAiQNQCISbA,14000000,14005680,enjoying their evening holding  confabulations and more entering the
RAiQNQCISbA,14005680,14011040,resort nibir what can you tell us four  more what's the number now
RAiQNQCISbA,14014319,14020399,yeah at least three to four people three  four mlas have entered here at the  radisson hotel in guwahati we are in
RAiQNQCISbA,14020399,14025680,front of the hotel the mls  arrived here in at about 9 15 p.m in the
RAiQNQCISbA,14025680,14032560,guwahati airport and they straight away  went inside the radisson blue hotel here  so that increases the number of mlas uh
RAiQNQCISbA,14032560,14039120,earlier it was estimated 35 mls and now  four more have added  within the shinde cam so the the show of
RAiQNQCISbA,14039120,14045199,strength has increased with the with the  four mlas that have entered the radisson  blue hotel here in gohan
RAiQNQCISbA,14045199,14053120,so let me let me very quickly in  summation viewers it is no longer  mr supariwala mr gaday and mr punawala
RAiQNQCISbA,14053120,14058960,it is no longer about convincing  the people or the panelists here it is
RAiQNQCISbA,14058960,14066000,now about convincing your own mlas who  are deserting you because they have lost  faith in uddhav leadership the mood
RAiQNQCISbA,14066000,14074479,question therefore then to consider  viewers if the shifts in our zone mlas  don't have faith in uddhav leadership
RAiQNQCISbA,14074479,14079680,can the public therefore  be expected to trust his leadership
RAiQNQCISbA,14079680,14085600,that's the mood question  ms pandey i'm sorry i couldn't come to  you for a longer period of time we will

RAiQNQCISbA,14448160,14455279,meanwhile even as we speak the chief of  ncp sharad favar along or with his chief  lieutenants are there holding a press
RAiQNQCISbA,14455279,14461000,conference we'll get to hear what the  status of
RAiQNQCISbA,14482580,14488000,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,14488000,14495760,good evening ladies and gentlemen the  crisis in maharashtra is keeping the  country on its toes well at least us
RAiQNQCISbA,14495760,14502960,journalists and the political pundits in  this country are  as of course are the mlas going from one
RAiQNQCISbA,14502960,14510319,side to the other and emissary is going  from one side to the other there is a  tectonic shift happening in maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,14510319,14516319,and seems like eikna chinde has the edge  for now an acceptance of
RAiQNQCISbA,14516319,14521439,that came from the chief minister too  when he said i don't want to get into
RAiQNQCISbA,14521439,14528399,the nitty gritties of numbers perhaps  because only 16 out of his total 55 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,14528399,14534560,are with him now and that number is  dwindling more than showing any signs of
RAiQNQCISbA,14534560,14542880,increasing but for now the chief  minister is putting up a brave face and  says he will not give in to any of these
RAiQNQCISbA,14542880,14549840,tricks and only give up his chair if  ignatinde and the rebels come
RAiQNQCISbA,14549840,14556399,speak to him face to face  and  then tell him and he will quit and make
RAiQNQCISbA,14556399,14563119,anybody else the chief minister but only  when they meet him face
RAiQNQCISbA,14573760,14576760,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,14602479,14605840,face to face
RAiQNQCISbA,14617199,14624479,edna chinde is confident of the numbers  he has  34 for now is what he says and let me
RAiQNQCISbA,14624479,14629520,show these numbers to you right here on  the screen
RAiQNQCISbA,14629520,14636479,the signatories on a letter submitted by  ekna chimde had 34
RAiQNQCISbA,14636479,14644479,signatures on them  34 and 3 of  the mlas have just made an entry into
RAiQNQCISbA,14644479,14653439,the radisson hotel in guwahati now 34  plus 3 is equal to 37 and 37 is the
RAiQNQCISbA,14653439,14659199,magic number as far as the  anti-defection law is concerned this is
RAiQNQCISbA,14659199,14664239,the number  which will be extremely important if uh
RAiQNQCISbA,14664239,14670239,ekna shinde has to get these  warts in place on the floor of the house
RAiQNQCISbA,14670239,14676560,now out of these 34 what happens is that  there are contests that are being made
RAiQNQCISbA,14676560,14683520,about whether each of these 34 whether  they are ship sena mlas yes or no well
RAiQNQCISbA,14683520,14690160,at least four of these have been found  out uh to be uh three mlas and one uh
RAiQNQCISbA,14690160,14696319,from a party that is a alliance partner  of the shiv cena called prahar party now
RAiQNQCISbA,14696319,14701359,if these four are reduced then uh  shinde has
RAiQNQCISbA,14701359,14709279,30 and three new who have joined him uh  come down to about 33 which is
RAiQNQCISbA,14709279,14714399,still  four away from  this
RAiQNQCISbA,14714399,14720399,magic number to avoid the anti-defection  law so it is the number game whether it
RAiQNQCISbA,14720399,14727920,is 37 as claimed by aida shinde or 33  but the fact of the matter is that 33
RAiQNQCISbA,14727920,14733840,already there even if you take the lower  estimate and if you add to this at least
RAiQNQCISbA,14733840,14740640,three or four members  of the legislative assembly who uh told
RAiQNQCISbA,14740640,14746800,deeper cash ricker who's another mla and  five of them had a sitting yesterday and
RAiQNQCISbA,14746800,14752800,they were ready to be with ekna cindy so  if three or four of those are also
RAiQNQCISbA,14752800,14758479,available then safely aikna cindy  crosses the 37 mark
RAiQNQCISbA,14758479,14764319,and  that's the number but  question is the three who have come in
RAiQNQCISbA,14764319,14770880,some say these are also  independents there was  five people who went in
RAiQNQCISbA,14770880,14776560,but three of them are mlas one is an  emily's wife and the fifth person we
RAiQNQCISbA,14776560,14782479,still don't know which political party  they belong to so it's all happening uh
RAiQNQCISbA,14782479,14788960,the seesaw of numbers but if you look at  uh the ultimatum given by uttar takri at
RAiQNQCISbA,14788960,14795439,5 00 pm he said that he will disqualify  all those who did not come back and meet
RAiQNQCISbA,14795439,14800720,him well no disqualification has  happened but any emotional appeal was
RAiQNQCISbA,14800720,14807920,made and only 16 people  officially counted by shiv cena of
RAiQNQCISbA,14807920,14813199,uddhav  well the writing is on the wall
RAiQNQCISbA,14813199,14819520,and this shows how uh the numbers are  stacked certainly uddha
RAiQNQCISbA,14819520,14825040,has lesser numbers than aknachinde  whichever way these numbers are going
RAiQNQCISbA,14825040,14830960,that seems to be  at the moment the number game in  maharashtra and
RAiQNQCISbA,14830960,14838399,there are scenarios or  what can happen in this we are standing  by for aikna shinde
RAiQNQCISbA,14838399,14843680,to address a news conference to reveal  his card but just a short while ago he
RAiQNQCISbA,14843680,14848960,took to twitter and this is what he had  to say
RAiQNQCISbA,14852160,14858159,[Music]  well on twitter he clearly said that
RAiQNQCISbA,14858159,14863199,you know he had the numbers and the  decisions to be taken now would be in
RAiQNQCISbA,14863199,14870560,the interest of maharashtra clearly an  unnatural alliance on the hindutva plank
RAiQNQCISbA,14870560,14877680,really failing for uttar takri but  ladies and gentlemen let me also tell  you uh the three scenarios that are
RAiQNQCISbA,14877680,14885120,possible from now  we've shown you the numbers if  these people come back and join ut
RAiQNQCISbA,14885120,14891600,which is unlikely uh scenario number two  shinde manages to get 37 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,14891600,14899279,and that crosses the anti-defection mark  and  well the bjp and shiv cena get together
RAiQNQCISbA,14899279,14906720,and form the government or of course we  see  some more horse trading that begins to
RAiQNQCISbA,14906720,14911920,happen on the floor of the house if this  number is not settled so the legitimate
RAiQNQCISbA,14911920,14917840,question that we're asking on the news  are tonight is this a stalemate or is it  going to be
RAiQNQCISbA,14917840,14924800,checkmate for uttar that's the question  and the debate on the other side
RAiQNQCISbA,14924800,14930479,you're watching the news hour at night  debate number one on times now super
RAiQNQCISbA,14930479,14937738,prime time  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,14939439,14946640,and joining me on the debate tonight  smitha prakash editor and i suhail said  author and columnist subrashtra author
RAiQNQCISbA,14946640,14954479,and founder of the churn uh chandra  shekhar jah leader of the shiv sena  sanjay author
RAiQNQCISbA,14954479,14960239,leader of the congress party with me in  the studios tonight ravi shivas the  political analyst but my first question
RAiQNQCISbA,14960239,14967439,goes to mr vijay krishna political  analyst supports  the shiv sena vijay krishnaji straight
RAiQNQCISbA,14967439,14974960,forward is  the shiv sena and its government all but  over in maharashtra that's the way it
RAiQNQCISbA,14974960,14980560,looks uh what's uh taking time for the  shiv cena to read the writing on the
RAiQNQCISbA,14980560,14985920,wall even though uttar is moving out of  his official residence at varsha and
RAiQNQCISbA,14985920,14991279,moving to matoshri  even as we speak
RAiQNQCISbA,14995359,15002880,now we are ready to accept whatever fate  has reserved for us  so we it is we we we are the architects
RAiQNQCISbA,15002880,15008560,of sena and basically i am also a shiv  senior and our support goes to udar
RAiQNQCISbA,15008560,15014720,takaraji whether he is the chief  minister of maharashtra or whether he is  the first you saying
RAiQNQCISbA,15014720,15020239,we are with him and we are not at all  we're not at all bothered about the  political upheavals
RAiQNQCISbA,15020239,15026399,uh which has been taking place for the  last two days because of the willie bjp  which wants to come back to power in
RAiQNQCISbA,15026399,15033359,maharashtra and we are saying that  please do not uh do not provoke the  tiger if the tiger is injured and it
RAiQNQCISbA,15033359,15039120,will come back with a full force please  we can again go back to the to the  people and
RAiQNQCISbA,15039120,15044159,we can tell what the bjp has been doing  all across india be it is karnataka
RAiQNQCISbA,15044159,15051319,madhya pradesh  or an attempted attempted coup in  rajasthan
RAiQNQCISbA,15052159,15058080,accepted by the tigers in your own in  your own party the tigers sitting in
RAiQNQCISbA,15058080,15064159,guwahati say that this is a fake tiger  because the plank that balazar thakrei
RAiQNQCISbA,15064159,15070239,set up which is anti-congressism  and the hindutva plan are both now no
RAiQNQCISbA,15070239,15076479,longer planks on which the shiv sena  stands and  many of those say that for the last one
RAiQNQCISbA,15076479,15083359,and a half years they've been trying to  tell mr ruddhaptakray the problems in  the party and how the party was being
RAiQNQCISbA,15083359,15089760,decimated yet nobody was ready to hear  them not even meet them now today to
RAiQNQCISbA,15089760,15096479,begin to blame the bjp do you think it's  too late apotheca that 40 of your mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,15096479,15102319,or 36 of them had left and gone for from  surat to gohati and you're blaming the
RAiQNQCISbA,15102319,15107560,bjp for it it's your government in  maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,15109439,15115040,so it it it shows that our leader trusts  trusts uh the his fellow shoes helix it
RAiQNQCISbA,15115040,15121040,was a a barely 25 people have betrayed a  leader we are not at all bothered but
RAiQNQCISbA,15121040,15126399,more than one crore voters of shuseina  are with the takarai family you have to
RAiQNQCISbA,15126399,15133279,know what is what leadership is  it's just because you have taken away  from 25 or 30 odd mlas to
RAiQNQCISbA,15133279,15137040,assam to assam one day will
RAiQNQCISbA,15150479,15155520,what will you do with them even if they  return because you don't think they are  tigers anymore
RAiQNQCISbA,15155520,15160800,well so say no so l said has the shifts  this is because they're behaving like
RAiQNQCISbA,15160800,15165120,subvertance to bjp  what
RAiQNQCISbA,15171840,15177359,do you think the jp should take the  blame or do you think their own house  was not in order
RAiQNQCISbA,15177359,15184319,so i want to answer your question in two  parts you're a national channel  you have done human work with various
RAiQNQCISbA,15184319,15190800,causes  i think insulting wildlife by calling  people horse traders rhinoceros
RAiQNQCISbA,15190800,15196080,tigers please don't insult animals they  are fine majestic people you know to say
RAiQNQCISbA,15196080,15202239,these people are indulging in hospitals  you're insulting a horse guilty as  charged number two guilty as you know
RAiQNQCISbA,15202239,15207760,it's not only you i mean your tigers you  should just remove animals from these  people's purview
RAiQNQCISbA,15207760,15213760,now vijay's specific point  the business of maintaining a flock
RAiQNQCISbA,15213760,15219680,belongs to the herdsmen it belongs to  the person whose party it is you can't
RAiQNQCISbA,15219680,15226640,blame the bjp i said this on navigate  kumar's program many years ago when this  khan market nonsense began that it is
RAiQNQCISbA,15226640,15232960,not narendra modi's job to go to khan  market looking for an opposition  but navika there are two things which we
RAiQNQCISbA,15232960,15239279,must consider prime minister modi when  he came to bar he said the power
RAiQNQCISbA,15239279,15245600,dangling of the past will no longer  happen  sadly the bjp is using the same means
RAiQNQCISbA,15245600,15251120,that have been used in the past so it is  only a version 2.0 or what was happening
RAiQNQCISbA,15251120,15256640,earlier number two  i don't think  any party should indulge in this because
RAiQNQCISbA,15256640,15262880,it's not about not shindi you are  violating the sanctity of trust of the  millions of voters who have voted a
RAiQNQCISbA,15262880,15267920,particular alliance or a particular  party to park  you know i mean this is bizarre
RAiQNQCISbA,15267920,15274560,every six months hotels get full for no  rhyme or reason people are flying up and  down in private planes mla say that
RAiQNQCISbA,15274560,15281279,they've been injected god knows with  what i mean this is a soap opera that  never seems to stop the anti-defection
RAiQNQCISbA,15281279,15287520,law is so weak and inseparable the  election commission often is under the  purview and the power of the ruling
RAiQNQCISbA,15287520,15292960,regime  where is democracy go so navigate the  critical question that you need to ask
RAiQNQCISbA,15292960,15298560,is that do these mlas have the right to  throttle the vote the sanctity of that
RAiQNQCISbA,15298560,15305600,vote that which they were elected by  that's the mood question it not shinde  and all other people are symptomatic and
RAiQNQCISbA,15305600,15312640,emblematic of the malaise that reflects  our democracy today and i would urge the  prime minister given his track record of
RAiQNQCISbA,15312640,15317920,transparency and governance to not allow  this and certainly not associate the bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,15317920,15324399,because then where are you a party with  a difference  how can how can you say that i'm a party  with the difference if this is what goes
RAiQNQCISbA,15324399,15330800,on right under your eye absolutely it's  uh it's really a mockery of the mandate
RAiQNQCISbA,15330800,15338960,of democracy  and it uh does absolutely nothing for  the people who actually uh vote
RAiQNQCISbA,15338960,15347840,for governments to stay on for five  years uh fair point uh suhail said but  uh let me ask
RAiQNQCISbA,15412170,15417479,[Music]  foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,15427920,15430920,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,15495040,15498040,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,15554100,15557209,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,15644880,15651760,is talking about morality that this is  not moral the way uh you know we are  seeing this uh whole
RAiQNQCISbA,15651760,15657840,play of numbers that's going on in  maharashtra and and he  acharya is talking about
RAiQNQCISbA,15657840,15663520,rahul gandhi morality of stepping down  from the president of congress position
RAiQNQCISbA,15663520,15671119,do you really believe that in the real  world  lectures on morality are rather  misplaced
RAiQNQCISbA,15673279,15679760,that also from politicians please  ethical unethical moral immoral
RAiQNQCISbA,15679760,15686800,these no please what we are seeing today  is nothing to do with ethics and  morality it's only a play of numbers uh
RAiQNQCISbA,15686800,15693520,and it's got nothing to do with uh  betrayal of a legacy or anything like  that that's not what has happened i mean
RAiQNQCISbA,15693520,15699760,uh it's it's if it was really about a  legacy of bala  then how come those hearts didn't bleed
RAiQNQCISbA,15699760,15705279,for the past three years and it's only  now two years they're  coming two years close to election
RAiQNQCISbA,15705279,15710720,suddenly they feel oh how will we go  back to the people and ask for their  vote because after all we asked for
RAiQNQCISbA,15710720,15717279,their vote because we were in uh  alliance with uh bjp before the election  and then after the election we went with
RAiQNQCISbA,15717279,15724159,the congress so how will we go back to  the people they didn't think about the  people when they made the government  when they made uh
RAiQNQCISbA,15724159,15730960,minister with power and congress support  where was the ethics in that where was  the morality in that you asked for votes
RAiQNQCISbA,15730960,15737040,for some other reason and you become  chief minister and what is this legacy  of bala balasa have never became
RAiQNQCISbA,15737040,15742080,chief minister diddy that is that legacy  not clinging to power so you know i
RAiQNQCISbA,15742080,15747279,don't believe any of them i mean  in fact today i felt uh you know udav
RAiQNQCISbA,15747279,15753199,takari actually cut a very sorry figure  i felt sad for him that you know he  looked like one shakespearean tragic
RAiQNQCISbA,15753199,15760720,hero he was talking about that i was  counted among the best chief ministers  during fighting covet i mean no
RAiQNQCISbA,15760720,15768399,that's not the certificate from random  people that you take and asking pawaji's  backing and supriya soolay's backing no
RAiQNQCISbA,15768399,15774159,where does the support from the shiv  sena come it comes from the streets of  mumbai and the streets of mumbai were
RAiQNQCISbA,15774159,15780880,silent today they were not reacting to  udha went to uh to what was happening  with shiv cena that itself should have
RAiQNQCISbA,15780880,15786720,been a sign today when he made a very  emotional appeal there should have been  thousands of people lining the streets
RAiQNQCISbA,15786720,15792080,i'm not saying that there should be  violence or they should be tortured and  all which incidentally is the legacy of
RAiQNQCISbA,15792080,15797439,of  of the earth while ship cena but not  that but they should have been lining
RAiQNQCISbA,15797439,15802640,the streets there was nothing like that  the shiv cena of today is nothing like
RAiQNQCISbA,15802640,15809920,the shiv cena of yesteryears and i won't  be surprised if there's a vertical uh  split in the party in the coming days if
RAiQNQCISbA,15809920,15816800,uh you know shinde doesn't manage to get  the complete numbers there might be a  split if uddhav doesn't give hand over
RAiQNQCISbA,15816800,15823199,the reins it's going to be it's going to  end up in the courts i don't see this  resolving itself quickly
RAiQNQCISbA,15823199,15828640,well clearly uh even though the numbers  are increasing with ekna cindy and we
RAiQNQCISbA,15828640,15834319,told you  he already had 34 plus one and now three
RAiQNQCISbA,15834319,15840080,more mlas have gone inside and those  three of them are from shiv sena gulab
RAiQNQCISbA,15840080,15847439,rav patil  he was a minister yogesh kadam again  shiv sena nirmala gavit shiv sena she
RAiQNQCISbA,15847439,15855359,even wrote a letter  that no action  okay and and the visuals of uddhav were
RAiQNQCISbA,15855359,15861120,leaving varsha and going across to mato  sri  those shots also coming in chandra khan
RAiQNQCISbA,15861120,15867199,patil also joins uh the dissident group  and he's an independent so three
RAiQNQCISbA,15867199,15873359,shivsena members of legislative assembly  uh have arrived at the radisson hotel in
RAiQNQCISbA,15873359,15880239,guwahati and their suitcase is going out  of matu shri and uddha takre all but
RAiQNQCISbA,15880239,15885279,uh sorry uh going out of varsha and uh  on to matoshi
RAiQNQCISbA,15885279,15892560,all but throwing in the towel but uh  about the furniture what about the  furniture is this seriously moving house
RAiQNQCISbA,15892560,15899279,through suitcases  i mean it's the worst symbol to present  to a to a people if you really believe
RAiQNQCISbA,15899279,15904960,that you are in charge of your party i  mean you know this is the amount of  baggage that
RAiQNQCISbA,15904960,15910479,with when you go on a navigate  flight and this is what he travels when  he's moving home
RAiQNQCISbA,15910479,15918560,no i mean what's your complaint you  think he should have more luggage  my complaint is these optics themselves
RAiQNQCISbA,15918560,15923920,tell a very pitiable story  i mean this is ridiculous that is as you
RAiQNQCISbA,15923920,15929840,said about throwing in the towel you've  thrown in the towel and the bags i mean  this is ridiculous i have not seen this
RAiQNQCISbA,15929840,15937680,ever before i mean normally people cling  onto their homes but this is an abject  he could have admission
RAiQNQCISbA,15939199,15944720,admission of defeat well but no  resignation yet today no resignation yet
RAiQNQCISbA,15944720,15949040,and that's the question i want to ask  chandra sheikh
RAiQNQCISbA,15951279,15957239,so it's fine but  maybe after a resignation  morality can't be above
RAiQNQCISbA,15957239,15965040,constitutionality at the moment and and  just moving out with your luggage with  your suitcases what what is the message
RAiQNQCISbA,15965040,15971438,to the people of maharashtra is there a  chief minister in town or not
RAiQNQCISbA,15974960,15980640,see today uh shaya has given a very  clear message that he is ready and
RAiQNQCISbA,15980640,15986720,willing to resign first thing  second thing  that  there is no
RAiQNQCISbA,15986720,15992239,less hindutva  and eventually  we have followed the hindu in much
RAiQNQCISbA,15992239,15998319,better way  third thing  if there is a fraction between the
RAiQNQCISbA,15998319,16006319,concerned persons  it can be resolved on  sitting at the concerned place and it
RAiQNQCISbA,16006319,16011840,can be discussed that whether  the party line has to continue in the
RAiQNQCISbA,16011840,16017760,same way or it has to be or the other  way so everything is clear he has spoken
RAiQNQCISbA,16017760,16025439,everything clearly and if you say today  that what he has done is not morality
RAiQNQCISbA,16025439,16032479,then what more than can be a morality  morality i say very clearly morality
RAiQNQCISbA,16032479,16037920,morality about walking out walking out  waiting for people who are not coming to
RAiQNQCISbA,16037920,16043120,him but going to gohati instead where is  the morality in that can you see any
RAiQNQCISbA,16043120,16048319,morality in that subrastaji can you see  any morality i mean no no whether
RAiQNQCISbA,16048319,16056159,whether whether whether that's attacked  against you i think morality demands  that you given your resignation
RAiQNQCISbA,16056159,16061198,said that uh you know right at the  beginning of the show and he's tweeted
RAiQNQCISbA,16084239,16089600,that we have to go with the bjp that is  their only demand so let them come let
RAiQNQCISbA,16089600,16095120,them sit let them be on table let's let  it be decided if they want to do it let
RAiQNQCISbA,16095120,16100159,them do it and and eventually  has already declared that is ready and
RAiQNQCISbA,16100159,16105920,willing to resign from the party chief  as well  but isn't it too late
RAiQNQCISbA,16105920,16112560,because  it has to be some one and a half years  there have been interlocutors within the
RAiQNQCISbA,16112560,16116880,party saying that the party is on
RAiQNQCISbA,16147760,16154720,i think  yes i think it's very clear especially  after rudolph takri addressed
RAiQNQCISbA,16154960,16161680,i don't know maybe his dissidence or  maybe he was trying to address the  people of maharashtra i don't really  know who the subject of his
RAiQNQCISbA,16161680,16167040,life was but whoever he addressed what  he said in the address made it very  clear that he doesn't have any issue
RAiQNQCISbA,16167040,16173520,aligning with the bjp i think he made it  he re i kept on reiterating that in 2014
RAiQNQCISbA,16173520,16178880,they put the elections together  historically they fought the elections  together so maybe he has made up his
RAiQNQCISbA,16178880,16185439,mind to go for an alliance with the bjp  now what i think i agree with sohail on  the point of uh you know the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,16185439,16192399,minister of a state leaving his official  residence like that in a suitcase  the message is extremely confusing for
RAiQNQCISbA,16192399,16198159,the people of maharashtra is there no  he's not in the suitcase  and if he is then why is he out of his
RAiQNQCISbA,16198159,16201159,official
RAiQNQCISbA,16226479,16234479,should understand that there was already  you know a brewing discontent in the  party for quite some time now now if mr
RAiQNQCISbA,16234479,16240560,uddav takri could not  ge you know assess that or guess  estimate what was happening then it's a
RAiQNQCISbA,16240560,16245840,complete failure of the political uh  of a political mind that he has
RAiQNQCISbA,16245840,16251439,i have said i've been saying this  navikaji and i'll reiterate this is this  is going to be a problem with second
RAiQNQCISbA,16251439,16258239,generation leaders one cannot expect  udav takri to be a balthakray one cannot  expect aditya thakura to even be one
RAiQNQCISbA,16258239,16264239,tenth of balticry or you know spitting  image of uttavata these are people who  have been handed over political
RAiQNQCISbA,16264239,16269279,positions just because they were born in  political families the kind of  aggression more
RAiQNQCISbA,16269279,16276319,that is required in politics the kind of  humility which is required to address  the consumption of the ground workers is
RAiQNQCISbA,16276319,16281680,completely missing  that family is not the first one what  was the role of mister
RAiQNQCISbA,16281680,16286720,in that  mr jha i'm not here to look at the no no
RAiQNQCISbA,16286720,16291840,i'm not here to look at the family  history of every political family in  india so when when you're making a
RAiQNQCISbA,16291840,16298159,general statement  if you disagree with me please show it  in your politics
RAiQNQCISbA,16298159,16304560,excellent no it cannot be a general  statement you are what are you trying to  master do you have the numbers with you
RAiQNQCISbA,16304560,16313040,okay let me ask you very straight  questions  do you have the numbers with you  no do you have the numbers
RAiQNQCISbA,16322239,16327479,i'm sorry but in a democracy i'm sorry  if you don't know
RAiQNQCISbA,16340080,16347040,but you need numbers  you know the constitution the  constitution
RAiQNQCISbA,16347439,16355120,the constitution puts down the process  may i tell you may i tell
RAiQNQCISbA,16356319,16361760,the constitution lays down the process  the rest can be theatrics but it doesn't
RAiQNQCISbA,16361760,16368399,amount to much because at the end of the  day you need the numbers to prove your  majority in the house and that's the way
RAiQNQCISbA,16368399,16375120,it works that's the way the mahabharata  was born because the bjp minus the
RAiQNQCISbA,16375120,16383039,senate could not form a government well  that's the way that's the settled  process but let me get in
RAiQNQCISbA,16384959,16391920,is there any other way  morality lectures can that take anybody  anywhere and by packing his bags and
RAiQNQCISbA,16391920,16398320,going out with suitcases  making a point giving some sort of a
RAiQNQCISbA,16398320,16403920,signal to the ship's next  quebecois  design
RAiQNQCISbA,16403920,16409760,but you guys are free to come on the  streets uh and and let's play the  emotional card because the
RAiQNQCISbA,16409760,16417119,constitutional card doesn't anymore  exist with us i i want to ask you what  does this symbolism really mean at this
RAiQNQCISbA,16417119,16422799,point for people in maharashtra  navika will answer that question i think  the
RAiQNQCISbA,16422799,16429840,half an hour into your program i think  the elephant in the room that needs to  be addressed  is why are shiv sena mlas who are
RAiQNQCISbA,16429840,16437199,dissidents of this government  why are they in guwahati  why was surat a bjp ruled state not safe
RAiQNQCISbA,16437199,16444639,enough for them  why were they transported at three  o'clock in the morning by a chartered  flight to gohari i'll tell you why
RAiQNQCISbA,16444639,16450080,because those numbers that mr shinto is  claiming and the bjp is hoping are
RAiQNQCISbA,16450080,16455760,suspect because they know that in closer  proximity those numbers will probably
RAiQNQCISbA,16455760,16461199,cross over to the other side that's the  first truism that we need to accept  number two
RAiQNQCISbA,16461199,16466561,and very critical you know this this  calling the bjp is a party with a  difference
RAiQNQCISbA,16466561,16471920,this needs to stop i mean the bjp is  probably the biggest electoral fraud and
RAiQNQCISbA,16471920,16477600,the political hypocrite the world has  seen i'll give you two examples related  to maharashtra alone
RAiQNQCISbA,16477600,16484799,they formed a government for a few days  with ajit pawar of the ncp  they are the ones when in bihar the
RAiQNQCISbA,16484799,16491840,congress and the jdu and the rgt won an  election the bgp comes from behind and  destabilizes the entire government did
RAiQNQCISbA,16491840,16498240,they have the public legitimacy to be in  government the answer is no and ravika  you already know about puducherry
RAiQNQCISbA,16498240,16504719,rajasthan  attempt to topple rajasthan mother  pradesh karnataka goa banipur the bjp is
RAiQNQCISbA,16504719,16510879,a party which is a monstrous machine  abusing the privilege of power for its
RAiQNQCISbA,16510879,16516480,own aggrandizement or the lust for power  let's put that in in a in a nutshell and
RAiQNQCISbA,16516480,16524240,put it away i don't think we need to  even debate the bgp's ethical standards  as far as the economy issues concern
RAiQNQCISbA,16524240,16531119,i disagree with what smitha said she  said that actually  didn't cut a good figure i thought what
RAiQNQCISbA,16531119,16536400,he said today was actually brilliant  i'll tell you why number one he went  public
RAiQNQCISbA,16536400,16543359,you know he was made to look like a a  guy who's going to lose he's facing a  party under rupture he went public he
RAiQNQCISbA,16543359,16549279,actually challenged  hindi he spoke to his dissidents in
RAiQNQCISbA,16549279,16556639,gohati he spoke to his senex he spoke to  the media he spoke to the public at  large he spoke to his alliance partners
RAiQNQCISbA,16556639,16564000,and he said listen if you don't want me  i believe to step out now the truth  navika is this this is hard arithmetic
RAiQNQCISbA,16564000,16569119,of politics  mr shinde will have to return to mumbai
RAiQNQCISbA,16569119,16574400,with whatever number he's claiming to  have a floor test ultimately it has to  be a floor test
RAiQNQCISbA,16574400,16580879,and think about it why did mr eknar  shinde not hold a press conference as he  had promised no no why is he so
RAiQNQCISbA,16580879,16587119,apologetic  while i am  i'm not going to object to the truisms
RAiQNQCISbA,16587119,16593520,that you have mentioned yes we've seen  manipur we've seen goa we've seen madhya  pradesh we've seen karnataka we've seen
RAiQNQCISbA,16593520,16600160,all that my question to you  is simple between the ncp the shivsena
RAiQNQCISbA,16600160,16606879,the congress party you ran the  government in maharashtra you have a  home department you have an entire state
RAiQNQCISbA,16606879,16613920,police  now 40 of your mlas go away from the  city you have no clue
RAiQNQCISbA,16613920,16620561,you have no clue  your own people  yeah  what kind of governance what kind of
RAiQNQCISbA,16620561,16627760,administration do you have to offer will  you answer that question as well i mean  shouldn't that question be asked you're
RAiQNQCISbA,16627760,16635279,so engrossed in yourselves and your  power games that you don't even know  what's happening to the other people in
RAiQNQCISbA,16635279,16642959,your own party who help you for form the  government why don't you answer that  question you can you you can criticize
RAiQNQCISbA,16642959,16648480,the bjp till the cows come home are they  supposed to look after your party as  well
RAiQNQCISbA,16648480,16654639,fair enough let me answer your question  you know if by mistake i leave my door  open in the night when i go to bed it
RAiQNQCISbA,16654639,16662680,doesn't give my neighbor a right to come  home and plan on my goods and stuff okay  okay so no let me make sure
RAiQNQCISbA,16668561,16671561,um
RAiQNQCISbA,16683600,16689680,you said you said that i can leave the  door open it doesn't give the right to  my to the neighbor to come in where
RAiQNQCISbA,16689680,16694719,you've answered the question can i come  and have it  one minute and it's very congress like
RAiQNQCISbA,16694719,16700400,uh you know i don't know why they  suspend you it's a very congress like  can i come and please no no the analogy
RAiQNQCISbA,16700400,16707439,analogy is misplaced navigating  if i know that there are thieves around
RAiQNQCISbA,16707439,16713119,which is the case with the political  class why the hell would i keep my door  open  a b
RAiQNQCISbA,16713119,16719039,are you comparing this to a burglary  this is not a burglary we are discussing  i know where sunday is coming from in
RAiQNQCISbA,16719039,16725600,his analogy i appreciate that but the  reality is there was no market  intelligence there was no police
RAiQNQCISbA,16725600,16732561,intelligence you weren't able to capture  the dissidence within your people  it is an abject failure of understanding
RAiQNQCISbA,16732561,16740160,the sentiment of your own party  so  i am not here to blame  i think it is a disastrous move for
RAiQNQCISbA,16740160,16746240,india's democracy  whoever comes to power is irrelevant the  fact that you can do this in broad
RAiQNQCISbA,16746240,16752000,daylight in itself suggests a terrible  strain of events we must change that
RAiQNQCISbA,16752000,16759279,navigator well we must change that and  and we can we can continue to pray till  the cows come home but have these people
RAiQNQCISbA,16759279,16764719,smitha forgotten how buddha singh  dissolved the government in bihar and
RAiQNQCISbA,16764719,16771840,how the president was facts and at that  time it was apj abdul kalam you know the  congress talking about ethics and the
RAiQNQCISbA,16771840,16777760,congress talking about oh my door was  open that doesn't give the right to  neighbors to come in what did they do
RAiQNQCISbA,16777760,16785040,bulgaria  have they forgotten those  uh pieces of history that they  themselves do not
RAiQNQCISbA,16785040,16790878,navigate can i respond to you on that  one  these are fissures in our democracy  which have existed i don't understand
RAiQNQCISbA,16790878,16796400,how mr can forget  how can mr jah forget that chandrasekhar  was made prime minister by rajiv gandhi
RAiQNQCISbA,16796400,16801440,and then toppled that same government  because there were two policemen  opposite his house anyway that's
RAiQNQCISbA,16801440,16807440,besides that i never said that  cut up bad or showed up bad i said he
RAiQNQCISbA,16807440,16814160,looked tragic and why did i say that he  looked tragic today like a shakespearean  hero shakespeare tragic shakespearean
RAiQNQCISbA,16814160,16819280,heroes are not bad they just they just  weak today he just looked as as suhail
RAiQNQCISbA,16819280,16825920,pointed out he just looked  incapacitated he just looked that he  didn't know what was happening he looked
RAiQNQCISbA,16825920,16831040,like a blanking he looked like he didn't  know  you know that  a whole bunch of people are going to be
RAiQNQCISbA,16831040,16836878,taken away to surat and then to gohati  he's just like i was the best prime  chief minister one of the best chief

RAiQNQCISbA,16843600,16850080,chief minister he might be very good  person fine but for being a good chief  minister good prime minister you need a
RAiQNQCISbA,16850080,16856400,whole bunch of other qualities you just  can't be somebody's son who has a legacy
RAiQNQCISbA,16856400,16863120,to you know to uphold he had he had to  be more than that he was running a  coalition where he had a good uh you

RAiQNQCISbA,16868878,16874798,minister you should have known that you  are not able to hold your flock together  what were you doing not being able to
RAiQNQCISbA,16874798,16880638,have a speaker for so many months when  you knew that they were people in your  own or you probably didn't know that
RAiQNQCISbA,16880638,16885680,there were people in your party who were  disgruntled and there could be a  situation where now what's going to
RAiQNQCISbA,16885680,16893600,happen  your speaker is not with you how is it  going to resolve  you know he looked even more pathetic

RAiQNQCISbA,17336878,17342240,of course it's a number game and of  course numerical uh strength will  surpass any other narrative which is

RAiQNQCISbA,18241200,18248560,two that a cabinet reshuffle can also be  done to accommodate some drift grunkle  folk three that he is going to shift out
RAiQNQCISbA,18248560,18255280,of the chief minister's residence  something that he in fact has already  done  and finally that he is willing to talk
RAiQNQCISbA,18255280,18261040,face to face to all rebels and address  their issues  but here's the thing
RAiQNQCISbA,18261040,18266878,here's the big if and it's a very big if  there is one thing that he did not talk
RAiQNQCISbA,18266878,18272560,about and ironically it is the only  thing that matters anymore will the ship
RAiQNQCISbA,18272560,18279360,cena continue to be in alliance with the  ncp and congress  because if it does
RAiQNQCISbA,18279360,18284480,then the split in the party is at a  point  of no return
RAiQNQCISbA,18284480,18291120,and here is why i say so  despite the chief minister's outreach  eknatch shinde made it clear
RAiQNQCISbA,18291120,18298240,that the problem  is not about who is the chief minister  it is the alliance itself the alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,18298240,18305440,that made udha the chief minister  in a series of tweets shinde again  lamented how the ncp and the congress
RAiQNQCISbA,18305440,18310718,had reaped the benefits alone in the 2.5  years of the agadi being in power and
RAiQNQCISbA,18310718,18317600,the ship's next was systematically  sidelined  so they also said that if the cena and
RAiQNQCISbA,18317600,18325200,xenix have to survive the only way to do  so is to exit this unnatural alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,18325200,18331920,so  if the cena wants to survive  if uddhav thakrei wants to continue in
RAiQNQCISbA,18331920,18337680,party and in government  is he going to take the one and only way
RAiQNQCISbA,18337680,18343840,out of the mess  and return  to the bjp alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,18343840,18349600,you're watching the newshour at 10  debate number one on times now super
RAiQNQCISbA,18349600,18353000,prime time
RAiQNQCISbA,18356638,18362480,okay joining us now on the debate  author of senior journalist sanjay gupta  leader of the ship cena
RAiQNQCISbA,18362480,18370560,political analyst but i first want to  cut across to aruni because even as we  speak  the bag and baggage has left from virsha
RAiQNQCISbA,18370560,18375920,it's headed to bhatushri and i believe  for a while there was almost disgusted
RAiQNQCISbA,18375920,18381202,of shifts who had turned up what's  happening now i don't need a quick  update
RAiQNQCISbA,18384400,18390000,i am reporting from outside the sahyadri  guest house now this road must be  looking deserted but it's just
RAiQNQCISbA,18390000,18395280,completely blocked uh with the entire  convoy of around 10 cars of cm
RAiQNQCISbA,18395280,18401600,but behind him was his son cm uh we are  behind him was his son adit attacker is  also a minister in maharashtra
RAiQNQCISbA,18401600,18407920,government his wife rashmi takri and the  entire conway and chipsenics were over  here some of them were getting very
RAiQNQCISbA,18407920,18415120,emotional because their ship sinner  suprema was vacating the official cm  residence and going to the mato shri
RAiQNQCISbA,18415120,18421200,residents over there now sanjay rao has  made a very interesting point very  significant point i would say that he
RAiQNQCISbA,18421200,18428000,said that cm uddo takre will prove his  numbers on the floor the floor of the  house if that was true then why did
RAiQNQCISbA,18428000,18433520,cmudotray vacate the official cm  residence is it another emotional appeal
RAiQNQCISbA,18433520,18438560,that cm udata is making  to his party carter to his rebel mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,18438560,18445120,because if we look at the number now  three more ships in our mlas that also  includes one of the close confidant of
RAiQNQCISbA,18445120,18452320,asia muda takara mr gulab rao patil who  is also a minister in this mahavika  sagadi government he's also gone and
RAiQNQCISbA,18452320,18454958,joined the
RAiQNQCISbA,18465200,18471760,how many sena how many independents  well if you look at
RAiQNQCISbA,18471760,18477120,well if you look at the numbers  there are 33 shifts in mlas at present
RAiQNQCISbA,18477120,18482320,in iknow in the camp he has been saying  that more are expected to join when the
RAiQNQCISbA,18482320,18488320,number reaches 37 then it will be game  over for cm  33
RAiQNQCISbA,18488320,18491360,and how many independents
RAiQNQCISbA,18494798,18500000,well with respect to independence  padmaja we are understanding that  between seven to ten independents are
RAiQNQCISbA,18500000,18507200,with ignacion but  now  the independence role is not that  important because ignacinda's camp first
RAiQNQCISbA,18507200,18514000,has to defeat or avoid the  anti-defection law and for that shifts  and mls are extremely paramount 37
RAiQNQCISbA,18514000,18520798,shifts in mlas can can help ignacion  they do that and then only we can expect  the bjp as
RAiQNQCISbA,18520798,18528878,to enter into the fray okay interesting  so they may not be able to dodge the  anti-defection law but uddhav does not
RAiQNQCISbA,18528878,18535440,have the numbers either if these numbers  33 cena and 10 independents that you're  giving us anything to go by
RAiQNQCISbA,18535440,18542240,43 of these people are currently in  guwahati and  we are being told that more are likely
RAiQNQCISbA,18542240,18548000,to join in arunian thanks very much for  getting us that quick update those  images you see out of uddhav
RAiQNQCISbA,18548000,18553920,leaving  varsha for matashri the chief minister's  residence has been vacated will he now
RAiQNQCISbA,18553920,18559520,step out of the chief minister's office  let me ask you this sanjay gupta
RAiQNQCISbA,18559520,18564798,to save the government will udhaftakray  go back to bjp there's only one formula
RAiQNQCISbA,18564798,18567842,one formula
RAiQNQCISbA,18593760,18595840,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,18621840,18623920,for
RAiQNQCISbA,18646750,18649810,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,18661440,18664440,um
RAiQNQCISbA,18700798,18703798,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,18734900,18742798,[Music]  how do you decode this deep message
RAiQNQCISbA,18742798,18749600,actually he's just uh what i can tell  you is he's just you know what is that  practice run kathy now he has to leave
RAiQNQCISbA,18749600,18756240,the cm office also so it's a small  practice right i don't know which mla  came and told him baba you leave the cm
RAiQNQCISbA,18756240,18762600,office or cm house i did any mla any  other
RAiQNQCISbA,18803680,18809840,just imagine what is the situation of  sushina i have been telling since  morning i told you also in the evening
RAiQNQCISbA,18809840,18815520,that with eight not shinde the serena  has also lost the muscle power that it
RAiQNQCISbA,18815520,18820958,used to have it used to enjoy and i'm  i'm not means i i don't mind mincing
RAiQNQCISbA,18820958,18827760,words the sushi now that  was there the solution that is there  today
RAiQNQCISbA,18828638,18831638,so
RAiQNQCISbA,18844878,18847842,when
RAiQNQCISbA,18858958,18864878,social next to wake up i'm telling you  so seniors are those socialists who wake  up and they don't even need a single
RAiQNQCISbA,18864878,18871120,person to tell them  interesting you mentioned that because  yesterday

RAiQNQCISbA,19636320,19642080,expected in surat tonight itself that's  what sources are telling us we already
RAiQNQCISbA,19642080,19648958,have if we have bishops  and independents together about 41 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,19648958,19656480,are there in guwahati and now we are  being told that six more mlas of the  shiv cena are expected in surat seven
RAiQNQCISbA,19656480,19663920,rooms have been booked in the hotel one  person has already reached one more has  crossed the gujarat border and four more
RAiQNQCISbA,19663920,19670400,are slated to come there from mumbai how  let's get a low down on that from  shivani yes shivani quick update who are
RAiQNQCISbA,19670400,19677200,these people well definitely this comes  at this particular hour of time that  there are six more ml of shifena those
RAiQNQCISbA,19677200,19684160,are expected to reach surat tonight and  in fact seven rooms have been booked in  a hotel and several names have also come
RAiQNQCISbA,19684160,19688330,in that is the  [Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,19689280,19696240,as of now what we are learning four more  are stated from mumbai in fact two  private just have already been booked at
RAiQNQCISbA,19696240,19704000,the surat airport and just like last  previous night as i was reporting from  the ground at 2 20 all of those mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,19704000,19710080,including ignacion they had landed at  surat airport and then they took a  flight around three o'clock and then
RAiQNQCISbA,19710080,19716000,they reached out to guwahati and that is  the same kind of reputation that we are  going to see tonight as well where all
RAiQNQCISbA,19716000,19721760,of these mlas will be reaching uh to  surah at one particular hotel and then  from there they will be moving to the
RAiQNQCISbA,19721760,19727200,surat airport at late in the night and  from there they will be reaching out to  guwahati to join
RAiQNQCISbA,19727200,19732400,us hindi along with other those mla and  as ikna shinde was rightly pointing out
RAiQNQCISbA,19732400,19737600,that he is very confident about 40 mlas  being in his skater and few more will
RAiQNQCISbA,19737600,19744638,also be joining him so it clearly seems  that more people from the court and from  the borders of udate are now shifting
RAiQNQCISbA,19744638,19751200,okay  but how is it that after uh  the speech also this movement is
RAiQNQCISbA,19751200,19758160,happening do they not  believe in uttar takari's assurances  well definitely the way the cm has
RAiQNQCISbA,19758160,19764160,purely mentioned and has somewhere  in fact shown  his degrees as well that people should
RAiQNQCISbA,19764160,19770400,not have moved to surah of any other  place rather they should have taken a  chance to meet him in person and sit and
RAiQNQCISbA,19770400,19775840,talk with him  let's very clearly remember from our  sources we are learning last year a few
RAiQNQCISbA,19775840,19782160,months back it was akina shinde who went  to see a along with 18 mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,19782160,19787760,and had a word with him regarding their  grace with respect to the mba alliance
RAiQNQCISbA,19787760,19792958,so it is not the uh first or second time  where ignac shinde has opposed the mba
RAiQNQCISbA,19792958,19798080,alliance or has not reached out to uh  you know that is why we
RAiQNQCISbA,19798080,19805280,are seeing that after that particular  emotional speech as well it seems that  the people those have faith in
RAiQNQCISbA,19805280,19811920,their strategy with respect to hindu  ideology or any other planning that mr  shinde is making at the moment with
RAiQNQCISbA,19811920,19817200,regards to formation of a party or  formation of an opposition against
RAiQNQCISbA,19817200,19822320,uh you know  it seems even more stronger than the  emotions all right
RAiQNQCISbA,19822320,19829600,ranks are definitely growing at this  point location their first reaction  uh how are you so sure that
RAiQNQCISbA,19829600,19834958,the mlas you are going they could be  also supporters of the
RAiQNQCISbA,19834958,19841600,and they could be simply going and  getting things sorted out and it could  happen they might be telling what is
RAiQNQCISbA,19841600,19847920,happening at the ground level don't you  think there is a lot of adrenal rush  that i'm seeing around so as to simply
RAiQNQCISbA,19847920,19855760,have some form of  destruction of mva government but let me  tell you this will not happen
RAiQNQCISbA,19855760,19860878,just by the way let me assure you there  is everything is and everyone is very  very calm
RAiQNQCISbA,19860878,19867280,everyone around me is extremely calm  there is no adrenaline at all that being  said i want you to you're absolutely
RAiQNQCISbA,19867280,19873360,right what are they doing there they  could be there to convince ikna cindy  also but let me just show you
RAiQNQCISbA,19873360,19880480,one hour ago the mlas who reached  and going by the looks of it
RAiQNQCISbA,19880798,19883798,again
RAiQNQCISbA,19893920,19900240,[Music]  uh  did you see the young mla called uh
RAiQNQCISbA,19900240,19906160,kadab  he is the son of ram das kadam a veteran  cena leader who has been unhappy for
RAiQNQCISbA,19906160,19913280,almost two years or one and a half year  and this kadam fellow the younger kadam  i'm talking about he is a close aide of
RAiQNQCISbA,19913280,19919360,aditya  he's not a close aide of uh uh he's not  part of the courtroom
RAiQNQCISbA,19919360,19925040,so even the younger generation who who  we used to think is
RAiQNQCISbA,19930878,19936958,and they are part of his older country  and they have started leaving mangesh  could alker all these people and i'm
RAiQNQCISbA,19936958,19944558,telling you they are hardcore social and  anybody who thinks that they are leaving  for guwahati to convince uh ignacion
RAiQNQCISbA,19944558,19953842,they then probably they they do not  understand even a bit of uh  sushena sorry uh location
RAiQNQCISbA,19964958,19970958,out of the cm residence he upheld the  legacy of ballas attack  was never interested in becoming the
RAiQNQCISbA,19970958,19977360,chief minister and the manner in which  he came out was graceful he simply said  okay i was the chief minister for the
RAiQNQCISbA,19977360,19983120,party for shift sata if the shift cervix  wants me want me to be the chief  minister i will be there if they don't
RAiQNQCISbA,19983120,19990240,want me i am happy to leave it  so the message that he gave  me notices was clear and he also stated
RAiQNQCISbA,19990240,19996718,that nowhere so tell me all the shifts  wanted him to become the chief minister  so he became chief minister did all the
RAiQNQCISbA,19996718,20003120,shift sendings also say we insist you  make your son a minister let me let me  complete it was in 2018 that the first
RAiQNQCISbA,20003120,20009920,time  went apart with that of bjp the split  happened in january 2018 and in 2019
RAiQNQCISbA,20009920,20015440,when the elections occurred at that  point of time also  contested the elections without egypt
RAiQNQCISbA,20015440,20023040,so there was no opposition from  the dead when the mva occurred there was  no uh opposition
RAiQNQCISbA,20034958,20041600,actually that is not true because that  is exactly what shivani said right now  that as far back as one year ago the
RAiQNQCISbA,20041600,20048878,same nation they had said that listen  what we are doing is suicidal pratap  sanayak actually wrote a letter saying
RAiQNQCISbA,20048878,20054000,that if after covet is over you want to  go back to people with any kind of
RAiQNQCISbA,20054000,20060558,support then you must go back to the bjp  i can show you number of statements that  people have given from within the shift
RAiQNQCISbA,20060558,20067360,people who are grassroots leaders say  this is headed towards disaster but  before we go any further i actually want
RAiQNQCISbA,20067360,20070920,to ask you sure
RAiQNQCISbA,20076558,20079558,mask

RAiQNQCISbA,20155120,20162000,complaint  for violating protocols as cm
RAiQNQCISbA,20164320,20170160,report because whatever you know as a  journalist we go with the official  statement and at five o'clock that was
RAiQNQCISbA,20170160,20177440,this first night  my face is dull my face is might not  look uh energetic because i'm suffering
RAiQNQCISbA,20177440,20184320,from kobe after that there has been no  statement from any official social now  party leader uh that his report came as
RAiQNQCISbA,20184320,20187320,negative
RAiQNQCISbA,20202878,20205842,negative
RAiQNQCISbA,20212718,20216042,what's up
RAiQNQCISbA,20228958,20236320,right now there is only one way out  for ut  the indications are clear varun saying
RAiQNQCISbA,20236320,20241600,that there is no going back for the  rebels unless there is a rapprochement
RAiQNQCISbA,20241600,20246796,between the two parties realistically do  you see that happening
RAiQNQCISbA,20252638,20258718,you may you know crucify me for saying  this but whatever i hear from all the  mlas i have been talking to for the last
RAiQNQCISbA,20258718,20267680,two to three days and i'm telling you i  was sitting with bjp mlas when they gave  me the info that cena mlas or mbl mlas
RAiQNQCISbA,20267680,20272718,have gone back or gone out of city and i  tweeted it at 10 on monday while
RAiQNQCISbA,20272718,20280958,everyone woke up at like 12 30 or 3 in  the night  you know i don't see in any form that
RAiQNQCISbA,20280958,20286878,this government will continue and this  government will fall is it is imminent i
RAiQNQCISbA,20286878,20292320,don't see it going to the floor test  also i see it before that it may uh uh
RAiQNQCISbA,20292320,20298240,resign and not only that the second  thing is the bjp i is silent the bjp the
RAiQNQCISbA,20298240,20304718,stock silent you see from them none of  their leaders are speaking except for  the runners i don't see any other leader
RAiQNQCISbA,20304718,20312480,coming anywhere and saying anything  the bjp is access assessing the  situation and i'm i'm told by many bjp
RAiQNQCISbA,20312480,20316958,leaders that they want a midterm poll  that

RAiQNQCISbA,20527200,20533680,occupy the highest office in our country  even as accolades poured in for the lady
RAiQNQCISbA,20533680,20541280,who has  faced adversities personal setbacks and  she humbly accepted her nomination the
RAiQNQCISbA,20541280,20546798,congress was quick to cast aspersions  and doubt her integrity and the intent  of this decision from deriding the
RAiQNQCISbA,20546798,20552798,outgoing president ramanath kovind to  calling dropper the murmur a dummy  president even before the presidential
RAiQNQCISbA,20552798,20558638,race picks up pace the congress went on  a slander spree audit raj former member

RAiQNQCISbA,20588320,20591718,prime time
RAiQNQCISbA,20597520,20602638,now the slander aside in a sense the bjp  has thrown down the gauntlet for the  other parties remember yashwan sinha is
RAiQNQCISbA,20602638,20609200,the nominee  for all the other opposition parties  combined now questions are being asked
RAiQNQCISbA,20609200,20616080,about whether sinha will step back for a  unanimous election of draupadi murmur to
RAiQNQCISbA,20616080,20621840,the office of president joining us  shazad punawala national spokesperson of  bgp location that continues with us
RAiQNQCISbA,20621840,20627520,vikraman our spokesperson of vck is also  with her with us my first question is to  saket goku national spokesperson of the
RAiQNQCISbA,20627520,20632558,tmc do you think that it's good form  that yeshwan sinha should step aside for
RAiQNQCISbA,20632558,20638400,draupadi murmur  no i actually i mean this is a democracy
RAiQNQCISbA,20638400,20645200,and everyone's allowed to practice  elections  that's the point behind contesting an  election so why should he step down i
RAiQNQCISbA,20645200,20652798,mean he brings to the table a certain  ideology the opposition brings the table  a certain ideology and what is the
RAiQNQCISbA,20652798,20658000,ideology of mr sinha to make him fit for  the highest office
RAiQNQCISbA,20658000,20663040,the former financement i mean seriously  asking me that he's the former finance  minister of india he's the former
RAiQNQCISbA,20663040,20669680,defense minister of india this is the  person with the proven track record of  governance  you know there is no tokenism here sorry
RAiQNQCISbA,20669680,20676000,we are not trying to make a you know we  don't use the president's office for  virtual signaling the president is meant  to be the guard the protector of the
RAiQNQCISbA,20676000,20683120,constitution and mr sinha brings all  those capabilities to the table but mr  smith occupied those offices while in
RAiQNQCISbA,20683120,20690000,government for a party which you say is  anti-thesis of everything that you hold  dear democracy and secularism
RAiQNQCISbA,20690000,20696480,no he was under mr mr b  government and ever since mr modi took  on the battle of the bjp mr yashwan
RAiQNQCISbA,20696480,20703200,sinha said that mr modi is a disaster  for this country and he left the bjp  after that  okay
RAiQNQCISbA,20703200,20708360,okay impeccable credentials versus  tokenism
RAiQNQCISbA,20713600,20720320,versus the bad cabinet now  is that how you guys measure i mean are  we what's the iq of this show like 11
RAiQNQCISbA,20720320,20725680,right now exactly of the people who are  present here it adds up  but anyway
RAiQNQCISbA,20725680,20732080,but that is that is not the point  that is not the point sir  that is not the point we are we are not
RAiQNQCISbA,20732080,20737440,into a juvenile method of debating me a  very juvenile question you might think
RAiQNQCISbA,20737440,20742798,so but you gave a juvenile argument if  you really want to get into such  adjectives
RAiQNQCISbA,20742798,20748160,a juvenile question was prompted by a  juvenile argument that being said
RAiQNQCISbA,20748160,20754160,that being said you're accepting that  his credentials are impeccable which  means you're saying all right so the
RAiQNQCISbA,20754160,20759680,watch by cabinet was a good cabinet  where you had impeccable credentials and  impeccable ministers
RAiQNQCISbA,20759680,20765360,right by saying that that mr yeshwan  sinha was the creator  cabinet that he had no history before
RAiQNQCISbA,20765360,20771760,that that mr ashwin was born became a  cabinet minister and that got him  qualified i mean how juvenile is this
RAiQNQCISbA,20771760,20778718,question really as juvenile argument  that preceded it but anyway let me take  it across to shazad
RAiQNQCISbA,20778718,20785120,punawala no tokenism of having a  draupadi murmur it is somebody who has
RAiQNQCISbA,20785120,20790920,professional credentials like yashwan  sinha why should he step back
RAiQNQCISbA,20792558,20798240,i'll just take 30 seconds on your show  and then i want to end my statement with  a video but before i do that let me just
RAiQNQCISbA,20798240,20803280,tell you that personally how happy i am  that the nda and the bjp and its

RAiQNQCISbA,21517680,21524320,huddle he is the one who is leading the  mba in a way and what is being said that  his role remains crucial to keep the
RAiQNQCISbA,21524320,21530558,flock together when it comes to the ncp  leaders the ships in our leaders and  also with the congress party let me
RAiQNQCISbA,21530558,21534878,straight away go across to madagascar  christian joining
RAiQNQCISbA,21536000,21543710,all the more crucial because we are  looking at defections that are happening  probably within the shifts in and the  congress
RAiQNQCISbA,21543710,21548830,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,21551170,21554410,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,21558798,21564718,several top opposition leaders are  currently at his residence we have  left leaders
RAiQNQCISbA,21564718,21570558,and raja who are present over here from  the side of the congress malik arjun  kharge as well as jeremy's present here
RAiQNQCISbA,21570558,21576718,as well and of course his own party  senior leader praful patel who is also  here at the residence of sharatha now
RAiQNQCISbA,21576718,21582718,what it appears is that we were earlier  expecting that there would be post 2  o'clock a meeting of opposition leaders
RAiQNQCISbA,21582718,21588000,inside the parliament that is what was  scheduled as of yesterday as of this  morning but now given the sudden
RAiQNQCISbA,21588000,21594400,developments in maharashtra it appears  that mr pawar is consulting with all of  the opposition parties and it appears
RAiQNQCISbA,21594400,21600480,that this meeting could be you know what  he has to say as far as the opposition  presidential candidate is concerned the
RAiQNQCISbA,21600480,21606878,name of yeshwan sinha was proposed at  yesterday's meeting is what sources have  indicated to us and now of course uh uh
RAiQNQCISbA,21606878,21613600,with yeshua himself tweeting that he  would want to work for a larger course  of the nation uh for opposition unity uh
RAiQNQCISbA,21613600,21619600,is what we understand uh is the meaning  of that and therefore uh in fact the  name of yeshwan sinha being proposed
RAiQNQCISbA,21619600,21624878,something that perhaps the tmc also  might not have objection to given that  uh yeshua sunnah has been a vice
RAiQNQCISbA,21624878,21632240,president of  congress so how things transpire at this  meeting remains to be seen but in the  midst of this crisis uh sharp power of
RAiQNQCISbA,21632240,21637840,course was in the national capital to  actually host and invite all political  parties for that all important

RAiQNQCISbA,21845520,21850798,instability hurdle and obstacle that he  is confident he'll overcome but the
RAiQNQCISbA,21850798,21857842,numbers do not look  that great for the shivsena leader
RAiQNQCISbA,21859680,21865200,a sense of gratitude coming in from the  tark race for all the supporters that  have gathered for them on the streets of
RAiQNQCISbA,21865200,21872400,mumbai this late in the night  their supporters throgged  not just matoshri but even varsha from
RAiQNQCISbA,21872400,21878240,where the chief minister left just a few  minutes ago  all across from varsha to matoshri is
RAiQNQCISbA,21878240,21883840,where the streets were lined with shiv  xenix and there you see a glimpse of
RAiQNQCISbA,21883840,21890160,odaf dhakra the chief minister  thronged by shiv senecks the mumbai  police having a hard time to keep them
RAiQNQCISbA,21890160,21895840,in control making his way to his  residence in bandra

RAiQNQCISbA,21901200,21906480,really well for the shiv cena there  because they have a feeling that uh
RAiQNQCISbA,21906480,21912878,it's not just a few rebel mlas that  ignacion day has taken away to goa  hearty but a major chunk of their party
RAiQNQCISbA,21912878,21918958,but these visuals where the show of  strength is evident for everyone to see  this definitely is going to give them
RAiQNQCISbA,21918958,21922120,some confidence

RAiQNQCISbA,21988798,21994958,udav thakrei and the tag race  face even now even in times of  uncertainty and rebellion it is
RAiQNQCISbA,21994958,22000320,something that the shiv cena chief and  the chief minister of maharashtra spoke  about during his facebook live that for
RAiQNQCISbA,22000320,22006320,him it is the love of the people that  matters and these scenes on the streets  of maharashtra are only going to give
RAiQNQCISbA,22006320,22009520,them that confidence isn't it
RAiQNQCISbA,22017440,22023040,which has a kind of an emotional connect  with  the ship sending this is the same
RAiQNQCISbA,22023040,22028638,matushri where uh  during his uh
RAiQNQCISbA,22028638,22033840,uh during his heydays used to command  authority from here this is the same
RAiQNQCISbA,22033840,22039040,pathoshery where all these rebel  abilities are used to go and meet uh bad
RAiQNQCISbA,22039040,22044320,hack ray at his residence the same was  the case with uttar takari as well so it
RAiQNQCISbA,22044320,22050480,is a very practical move if one has to  look at it because he is vacated from  his official residence
RAiQNQCISbA,22050480,22056160,that is the virtual move to mata sri and  there a show of strength being seen from
RAiQNQCISbA,22056160,22064958,the shitheadings basically pouring at  matashri giving their love and support  for aditya and mainly for uh
RAiQNQCISbA,22064958,22071120,now what exactly  a transfer is that will be extremely  crucial exactly how many mlas that the
RAiQNQCISbA,22071120,22076320,expression they have because all these  are off to a very large extent emotional
RAiQNQCISbA,22076320,22082480,appeals being made by uh the cmudot  facebook live was all about that
RAiQNQCISbA,22082480,22089440,basically telling it much in this camp  that if you had an ingredient you should  come to me directly speak to me if one
RAiQNQCISbA,22089440,22096240,mla also has any problem i have no  problem in vacating my chair the chair  is not important but the love of my
RAiQNQCISbA,22096240,22101360,people uh is important now this another  uh emotional appeal being made
RAiQNQCISbA,22101360,22109360,from uh the uh from the doors of mother  shari by seeing  the family basically giving out another
RAiQNQCISbA,22109360,22114558,signal to uh however with respect to  numbers are concerned we understand that
RAiQNQCISbA,22114558,22121920,yes three mlas today these three system  himalayas these they fast in this camp  and if more mlas are expected to reach
RAiQNQCISbA,22121920,22127280,tomorrow as well that's what a claim for  economy plays from ignacing this camp
RAiQNQCISbA,22127280,22132480,are but if that happens and if in this  camp reaches 37 mls which is the magical
RAiQNQCISbA,22132480,22138480,number then we can expect the bjp and  the the partners to swing into action
RAiQNQCISbA,22138480,22144798,absolutely the numbers may not be on  their side for now because the rebel  camp numbers are swelling but this is
RAiQNQCISbA,22144798,22150000,the scene that now is being seen outside  matoshri in bandra
RAiQNQCISbA,22150000,22156080,in mumbai there those are the scenes  coming in of shiv scenics lining up the  streets
RAiQNQCISbA,22156080,22161840,that definitely gives uttav thakrei and  the aghadi confidence that the support
RAiQNQCISbA,22161840,22167920,of the people still lies with them but  is it the support of mlas still with  them and that is something that is going
RAiQNQCISbA,22167920,22174718,to be imperative in determining whether  or not he can keep his chief minister's  chair for now he's vacated his official
RAiQNQCISbA,22174718,22180798,chief ministers bangalore to return to  mato sri in a symbolic gesture the  residents may have been left but the
RAiQNQCISbA,22180798,22186080,chair is still his and that is something  that the bjp says is completely immoral
RAiQNQCISbA,22186080,22191440,but there's also more breaking news now  coming in because the troubles do not  end there for dafthakray the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,22191440,22198080,minister  bjp has now filed a complaint against  chief minister uddhav thakrei for
RAiQNQCISbA,22198080,22203280,violating covet 19 protocol remember it  was in his
RAiQNQCISbA,22203280,22210558,facebook live at about 6 pm this evening  when he came out and said that my  demeanor is dull i look not in the pink
RAiQNQCISbA,22210558,22217360,of my health because i am covered  positive and not because of the recent  ongoing and despite that we see the kind
RAiQNQCISbA,22217360,22224638,of crowds that he is surrounded by  outside his residence
RAiQNQCISbA,22224638,22229680,is he jeopardizing lives of people for  his power for these optics that's what
RAiQNQCISbA,22229680,22235680,the bjp is asking and they've now  officially filed a complaint in that  regard as well what has prompted this
RAiQNQCISbA,22235680,22240798,complaint is of course the admission  coming in from the chief minister  himself that he tested positive for
RAiQNQCISbA,22240798,22244682,kovit 19 this morning
RAiQNQCISbA,22247780,22250840,[Music]
RAiQNQCISbA,22261600,22263840,a
RAiQNQCISbA,22289840,22295040,we of course are seeing the kind of  crowds that he's surrounded by  what exactly is it that you are now
RAiQNQCISbA,22295040,22298040,seeking
RAiQNQCISbA,22345360,22347840,say
RAiQNQCISbA,22371600,22374600,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,22394798,22397798,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,22412160,22417282,which is why after that not only is he  meeting his supporters
RAiQNQCISbA,22429840,22431920,a
RAiQNQCISbA,22453920,22456920,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,22478558,22483760,for jeopardizing lives there in mumbai a  few hours after he himself admitted that
RAiQNQCISbA,22483760,22489200,he had tested positive for covid19 he  said that in his facebook live at about
RAiQNQCISbA,22489200,22494240,6 p.m but just hours later he was seen  not only meeting his alliance partners
RAiQNQCISbA,22494240,22499360,to get the government back on track but  is also now in the midst of hundreds of  shift centers who've come out on the
RAiQNQCISbA,22499360,22508160,streets of mumbai to show their support  in this time of instability god of my  colleague now joins us from outside

RAiQNQCISbA,22652480,22655480,foreign
RAiQNQCISbA,22697040,22702240,they left their official cm's residence  varsha they reached matoshri even as
RAiQNQCISbA,22702240,22709280,hundreds of shift settings lined up the  streets to show the tagre parivar that  they stand with them but has the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,22709280,22715760,minister put all of those hundreds of  lives into jeopardy by his careless  behavior well the bjp really likes to
RAiQNQCISbA,22715760,22720878,believe so and dr sanjeev chairman of  nephron is with us uh thank you so much  for speaking with us this late at night
RAiQNQCISbA,22720878,22726478,dr maguire uh  whether or not his rt pcr test is  negative or positive whether it was an
RAiQNQCISbA,22726478,22731760,antigen test  that still remains to be seen but even  if there are doubts why not just be
RAiQNQCISbA,22731760,22738160,careful why  walk into a crowd of hundreds of people  when you know you could be symptomatic
RAiQNQCISbA,22738160,22743680,of a virus that has wreaked havoc in the  city of mumbai in the past  uh good evening i think there are
RAiQNQCISbA,22743680,22749760,separate sector of rules for these kind  of politicians and separate set of rules  for the rest of the public i think this
RAiQNQCISbA,22749760,22755202,is not only carelessness but complete uh  colossal
RAiQNQCISbA,22756478,22763520,colossal failure of maintaining as a  front face of the covet fight haven't we  seen enough of death misery tears and
RAiQNQCISbA,22763520,22768638,pain and so many amounts of fear of  casualties and fatalities all over india
RAiQNQCISbA,22768638,22775920,and mainly in bombay uh whether he's  positive or negative if he has symptoms  we treat it as covet so the first thing
RAiQNQCISbA,22775920,22782638,he should be doing is he should be  isolating himself not meeting anyone and  if indeed in the last four to five days
RAiQNQCISbA,22782638,22789040,he has met anyone those people should be  contact racing so what have we done in  the last two years we've not learned a
RAiQNQCISbA,22789040,22794878,lesson at all none of the people are  wearing a mask i'm seeing it on screen  right now there are there are
RAiQNQCISbA,22794878,22801040,not even an inch of social distancing  between one to another uh  if a person is positive he's going to
RAiQNQCISbA,22801040,22807040,become a super spreader event so i think  this defies the complete purpose and we  know that this o micron what we are
RAiQNQCISbA,22807040,22813440,seeing as the new sub lineages of ba 0.2  is highly invasive it transmits very
RAiQNQCISbA,22813440,22819840,quickly it is going to have more amount  of immune invasion even the vaccine  invasion so what this particular
RAiQNQCISbA,22819840,22825120,gentleman has done is he's destroyed  everything what we have done for the  last many months up to a year or two
RAiQNQCISbA,22825120,22830798,completely unacceptable and wrong and i  think these kind of people should be  hauled up what have we done to the pro
RAiQNQCISbA,22830798,22837120,covet protocols absolutely and dr bakay  it's ironic because today while he was  addressing that uh facebook live that he
RAiQNQCISbA,22837120,22842638,did while talking about his uh  uh stay on with me bjp ahmed malwa is
RAiQNQCISbA,22842638,22848958,also with us on this broadcast thank you  so much for speaking with us this late  at night uh mr malvia but the visuals  are proof there of what the chief
RAiQNQCISbA,22848958,22854400,minister should not have been doing even  if he had the slightest doubt that he  could have had coveted
RAiQNQCISbA,22854400,22861120,well there is an official communication  from the maharashtra government that the  chief minister is covered positive
RAiQNQCISbA,22861120,22867920,the notification came about three hours  ago and that was given as one of the  reasons why he would address
RAiQNQCISbA,22867920,22875200,uh the cabinet meeting through a video  conference he has since met sharat pavar  and other leaders of the ncp at his
RAiQNQCISbA,22875200,22880320,residence and then he's moving amongst  people thousands of them perhaps at this
RAiQNQCISbA,22880320,22888400,late hour and he's likely to be the  super spreader in mumbai is this what a  responsible politician is supposed to do
RAiQNQCISbA,22888400,22893680,and this is exactly the reason why cena  mlas have revolted against him because
RAiQNQCISbA,22893680,22898958,his politics of being too clever by half  becoming chief minister by deceit is
RAiQNQCISbA,22898958,22905440,what has led to the unrest in his own  party  hi mr malia don't you think it's ironic  because this evening when he did that
RAiQNQCISbA,22905440,22912080,facebook live he was talking about how  he was one of the top five chief  ministers who was uh accorded that honor
RAiQNQCISbA,22912080,22918400,of having fought kovit 19 in a city like  mumbai efficiently  well if you ask anybody in mumbai and
RAiQNQCISbA,22918400,22923760,for that matter maharashtra kovit was  handled in the worst possible manner the
RAiQNQCISbA,22923760,22931280,number of deaths per million is amongst  one of the highest in mumbai as far as  indian cities uh go therefore udav
RAiQNQCISbA,22931280,22936798,cannot claim  any great achievement if at all  something was done was done by the bmc
RAiQNQCISbA,22936798,22942638,commissioner  did not even come out of this house let  alone managing covet
RAiQNQCISbA,22942638,22948000,right mr malia thank you so much for  speaking with us here on times now the  bjp upping the ante against uh cm who's
RAiQNQCISbA,22948000,22953760,been extremely careless uh when he has  himself admitted that he has covet 19
RAiQNQCISbA,22953760,22959440,even then right after that facebook live  that he did this evening he went ahead  to meet his alliance partners and now
RAiQNQCISbA,22959440,22966160,he's in the midst of hundreds of shift  scenics the aam janta of mumbai whose  life he has put in danger and that
RAiQNQCISbA,22966160,22972558,cannot be pardoned is what the bjp says  a complaint to that effect has also been  filed by a bjp leader tajinder bhaga but
RAiQNQCISbA,22972558,22978080,the crisis in maharashtra is never  ending the show of strength of the
RAiQNQCISbA,22978080,22984718,people of the supporters  is one part of the optics but as far as  numbers are concerned it definitely does
RAiQNQCISbA,22984718,22991760,not bode well for rudolf thak ray  perhaps not for his alliance partners as  much but definitely not good news for
RAiQNQCISbA,22991760,22997040,udav takri and an acceptance of that  came from him when he tried to say that
RAiQNQCISbA,22997040,23005600,i don't want to get into the  nitty-gritties of the numbers while he  addressed that facebook live because  perhaps the fact that he has 16 or less
RAiQNQCISbA,23005600,23011280,mlas left with him and close to 40 now  are in guwahati including his own party
RAiQNQCISbA,23011280,23016320,members and several independent mlas as  well odata perhaps does not want to get
RAiQNQCISbA,23016320,23019042,into the special
