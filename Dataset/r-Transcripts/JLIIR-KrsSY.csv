JLIIR-KrsSY,80,1199,in this video you're going to see me
JLIIR-KrsSY,1199,3120,attempt to spend 100
JLIIR-KrsSY,3120,5279,on street food in one of saigon's famous
JLIIR-KrsSY,5279,7200,night markets the name of this market is
JLIIR-KrsSY,7200,9760,hote gate this market is mainly on one
JLIIR-KrsSY,9760,11360,big street that is completely lined with
JLIIR-KrsSY,11360,13040,different food stalls it's become so
JLIIR-KrsSY,13040,14639,popular now that anywhere you can fit a
JLIIR-KrsSY,14639,16480,mini kitchen people are putting food and
JLIIR-KrsSY,16480,19119,selling food it is 5 40 p.m right now
JLIIR-KrsSY,19119,20800,and so the sun is gonna keep going down
JLIIR-KrsSY,20800,22080,and more and more food vendors are going
JLIIR-KrsSY,22080,24000,to come out as well as hungry patrons
JLIIR-KrsSY,24000,27270,i'm very excited let's do this
JLIIR-KrsSY,27270,31920,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,31920,33200,this is our first place it's called
JLIIR-KrsSY,33200,35760,panchong non hong kong apparently this
JLIIR-KrsSY,35760,37680,place takes inspiration from hong kong
JLIIR-KrsSY,37680,39040,but maybe not the food that i'm
JLIIR-KrsSY,39040,40640,interested in here they have a special
JLIIR-KrsSY,40640,42640,egg sausage dish which i know doesn't
JLIIR-KrsSY,42640,44000,sound that exciting but if you grew up
JLIIR-KrsSY,44000,45920,white trash like me those are essential
JLIIR-KrsSY,45920,47600,cooking ingredients and they found a way
JLIIR-KrsSY,47600,49280,to remix them here like i've never seen
JLIIR-KrsSY,49280,51360,before it starts with a sausage that's
JLIIR-KrsSY,51360,53120,wrapped in an egg from there she puts on
JLIIR-KrsSY,53120,54960,ketchup then shrimpies then mayonnaise
JLIIR-KrsSY,54960,56879,and finally pork floss come take a look
JLIIR-KrsSY,56879,59120,when i flip it around back you can see
JLIIR-KrsSY,59120,60559,the egg how it's wrapped around the
JLIIR-KrsSY,60559,62239,sausage you can't even see the sausage
JLIIR-KrsSY,62239,63680,at this point but i'm telling you it is
JLIIR-KrsSY,63680,66530,there let's try it out
JLIIR-KrsSY,66530,68560,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,68560,70479,wow so much happening my mind is full of
JLIIR-KrsSY,70479,72320,confusion the sausage is super soft
JLIIR-KrsSY,72320,74479,almost like a pate
JLIIR-KrsSY,74479,76080,and then the sauce it's sweet it's
JLIIR-KrsSY,76080,77439,savory you get a little bit of texture
JLIIR-KrsSY,77439,78720,from the shrimp in there i'm gonna try
JLIIR-KrsSY,78720,80080,taking a little bit of a smaller bite
JLIIR-KrsSY,80080,82479,this time
JLIIR-KrsSY,83040,84640,sausage egg you get the texture from
JLIIR-KrsSY,84640,86000,both you get the flavor from both the
JLIIR-KrsSY,86000,87680,strength of vietnamese street food is in
JLIIR-KrsSY,87680,89360,the creativity and the innovation always
JLIIR-KrsSY,89360,90720,coming up with new stuff because you
JLIIR-KrsSY,90720,92320,don't need a ton of money to create
JLIIR-KrsSY,92320,93680,really interesting delicious street
JLIIR-KrsSY,93680,95280,foods i love it this is our first food
JLIIR-KrsSY,95280,96880,we are just getting started let's keep
JLIIR-KrsSY,96880,99880,going
JLIIR-KrsSY,101040,102960,boom on to our second food right here
JLIIR-KrsSY,102960,104399,this is one of my favorite foods in
JLIIR-KrsSY,104399,106320,vietnam and a food that i never actually
JLIIR-KrsSY,106320,108240,even tried until moving to this country
JLIIR-KrsSY,108240,110240,i'm talking about the snail this is no
JLIIR-KrsSY,110240,112079,ordinary snail come take a close look
JLIIR-KrsSY,112079,114000,you can see that the snail has something
JLIIR-KrsSY,114000,116240,poking out of it that is not the actual
JLIIR-KrsSY,116240,118479,snail body that is pork so they've
JLIIR-KrsSY,118479,120719,actually removed the snail they add pork
JLIIR-KrsSY,120719,122479,in and i think they put the snail back
JLIIR-KrsSY,122479,124640,into the snail and they tie it all in
JLIIR-KrsSY,124640,126240,there with a piece of lemongrass i think
JLIIR-KrsSY,126240,127920,i'll get six of these and then they have
JLIIR-KrsSY,127920,129599,another kind of snail over here nothing
JLIIR-KrsSY,129599,131280,extra stuffed inside it's just a snail
JLIIR-KrsSY,131280,132879,i'm gonna try them both sit down and
JLIIR-KrsSY,132879,134540,give it a ride
JLIIR-KrsSY,134540,136319,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,136319,138160,it's right here two types of snails i'm
JLIIR-KrsSY,138160,139200,very excited because i haven't had
JLIIR-KrsSY,139200,140560,snails for a long time right here we
JLIIR-KrsSY,140560,142319,have a fresh water snail this is from
JLIIR-KrsSY,142319,144080,the mekong delta she put a bunch of
JLIIR-KrsSY,144080,145120,different stuff in there we've got
JLIIR-KrsSY,145120,147360,ginger chilies some different herbs
JLIIR-KrsSY,147360,149040,before she even gives it to you she
JLIIR-KrsSY,149040,151040,boils it in coconut water which is a
JLIIR-KrsSY,151040,152879,very mekong delta thing to do oh this is
JLIIR-KrsSY,152879,154400,what we want right here see that's the
JLIIR-KrsSY,154400,155680,meat right here and that is the little
JLIIR-KrsSY,155680,157440,poop sack on the bottom and you can eat
JLIIR-KrsSY,157440,159920,all of that
JLIIR-KrsSY,161840,163360,oh yeah delicious it's interesting
JLIIR-KrsSY,163360,164720,because some parts of the snail are kind
JLIIR-KrsSY,164720,166720,of gooey and almost oyster like and then
JLIIR-KrsSY,166720,168239,some parts are really crunchy not
JLIIR-KrsSY,168239,169680,crunchy like a potato chip but like
JLIIR-KrsSY,169680,171360,crunchy how sometimes meat can get a
JLIIR-KrsSY,171360,173680,little bit crunchy
JLIIR-KrsSY,173680,175599,even with no fish sauce quite delicious
JLIIR-KrsSY,175599,177200,and you can actually taste the coconut
JLIIR-KrsSY,177200,178959,water that she boiled it in next up
JLIIR-KrsSY,178959,181040,right here this is the pork snail when
JLIIR-KrsSY,181040,182480,you pick it up all these are stuck
JLIIR-KrsSY,182480,184239,together in order to take it out they've
JLIIR-KrsSY,184239,186159,tied some lemongrass here so you get the
JLIIR-KrsSY,186159,188480,lemongrass you hold it on both sides and
JLIIR-KrsSY,188480,191360,you pull buried inside all that meat is
JLIIR-KrsSY,191360,193599,the actual snail itself very cool very
JLIIR-KrsSY,193599,194959,creative i'm gonna try it out without
JLIIR-KrsSY,194959,199319,any sauce let's go for it
JLIIR-KrsSY,199920,201200,you taste the lemongrass and this
JLIIR-KrsSY,201200,203599,beautiful pairing of just juicy savory
JLIIR-KrsSY,203599,205200,pork but then inside of that is that
JLIIR-KrsSY,205200,206959,crunchy delicious snail two things you
JLIIR-KrsSY,206959,208400,wouldn't think would go together well
JLIIR-KrsSY,208400,209920,you don't exactly picture a pig in a
JLIIR-KrsSY,209920,211680,stale holding hands walking down the
JLIIR-KrsSY,211680,213280,beach together they don't seem like
JLIIR-KrsSY,213280,215120,there'd be star crossed lovers but in
JLIIR-KrsSY,215120,216879,this instance those two ingredients go
JLIIR-KrsSY,216879,218480,together incredibly well i'm gonna dip
JLIIR-KrsSY,218480,220560,the rest of this in this fish sauce oh
JLIIR-KrsSY,220560,224080,it's glistening um
JLIIR-KrsSY,224720,226319,while you're working that is incredible
JLIIR-KrsSY,226319,229120,next food let's go
JLIIR-KrsSY,229300,231519,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,231519,233439,we've just stumbled upon our next food
JLIIR-KrsSY,233439,235519,right here oh my gosh the pan is hot
JLIIR-KrsSY,235519,237280,she's frying some of this batter right
JLIIR-KrsSY,237280,239519,now so this is a rice batter that she's
JLIIR-KrsSY,239519,241280,putting into this tin this is a dish
JLIIR-KrsSY,241280,242799,called bangkot it's very famous in the
JLIIR-KrsSY,242799,244400,city called wong tao but here she's kind
JLIIR-KrsSY,244400,246480,of remixed and made her own version of
JLIIR-KrsSY,246480,247840,it so right now she's putting in these
JLIIR-KrsSY,247840,250000,little quail eggs into each one and then
JLIIR-KrsSY,250000,251439,you get to pick other toppings that you
JLIIR-KrsSY,251439,253360,want inside your little fried cup so
JLIIR-KrsSY,253360,255040,she's putting in some artificial crab
JLIIR-KrsSY,255040,256398,legs some shrimp
JLIIR-KrsSY,256398,259708,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,260000,262079,right now she's adding in some pork to
JLIIR-KrsSY,262079,264000,some of the pups then scallion oils of
JLIIR-KrsSY,264000,266080,scallion on top of everything from their
JLIIR-KrsSY,266080,268800,crispy fried onions
JLIIR-KrsSY,268800,270320,it looks like we may have had a slight
JLIIR-KrsSY,270320,272000,miscommunication because i have four
JLIIR-KrsSY,272000,273600,plates of food in front of me right here
JLIIR-KrsSY,273600,275919,but the total comes up to 160 000 which
JLIIR-KrsSY,275919,277280,means we're getting even closer to our
JLIIR-KrsSY,277280,278560,goal this one right here you can see
JLIIR-KrsSY,278560,280240,some of the crunchy scallions on top you
JLIIR-KrsSY,280240,281840,can see that green onion even the
JLIIR-KrsSY,281840,284320,outside it is like rippling crispiness i
JLIIR-KrsSY,284320,285759,just want to see how it tastes on its
JLIIR-KrsSY,285759,287240,own let's go for it
JLIIR-KrsSY,287240,288450,[Applause]
JLIIR-KrsSY,288450,290560,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,290560,292560,it's almost like a little creamy inside
JLIIR-KrsSY,292560,295120,on the outside ultra crunchy crispy you
JLIIR-KrsSY,295120,296240,can taste a little bit of the meat you
JLIIR-KrsSY,296240,297600,can taste the egg in there but i gotta
JLIIR-KrsSY,297600,299759,say there's almost no flavor here the
JLIIR-KrsSY,299759,301199,flavor is really gonna come from any of
JLIIR-KrsSY,301199,303039,the herbs you put on it or this potent
JLIIR-KrsSY,303039,304960,fish sauce right here and that has i
JLIIR-KrsSY,304960,306560,believe some pickled radish so the next
JLIIR-KrsSY,306560,308080,move is to grab one and really
JLIIR-KrsSY,308080,310230,completely submerge it in this sauce
JLIIR-KrsSY,310230,313039,[Music]

JLIIR-KrsSY,350000,351440,it's gonna be fried crunchy and
JLIIR-KrsSY,351440,353360,absolutely delicious this is a big win
JLIIR-KrsSY,353360,355280,plus we spend almost six dollars here so
JLIIR-KrsSY,355280,358560,we're really racking up the money
JLIIR-KrsSY,360639,362479,it's still raising oh this is not good
JLIIR-KrsSY,362479,363759,i'm trying to get as close to the
JLIIR-KrsSY,363759,365520,counter as i can my ass is getting
JLIIR-KrsSY,365520,367199,poured on right now right here they have
JLIIR-KrsSY,367199,369039,a big selection of meats a nice big
JLIIR-KrsSY,369039,371039,variety i've just ordered one of these

JLIIR-KrsSY,374880,376720,get a whole octopus like this i've
JLIIR-KrsSY,376720,378639,ordered a whole octopus it's on the
JLIIR-KrsSY,378639,380720,grill right now next to some kebabs in
JLIIR-KrsSY,380720,382080,addition to the octopus i'm going to get
JLIIR-KrsSY,382080,384400,some of these this is ball noon
JLIIR-KrsSY,384400,386000,beef that's been grilled and they
JLIIR-KrsSY,386000,388319,squeeze it on some lemongrass like that
JLIIR-KrsSY,388319,389600,so it's already cooked they're just
JLIIR-KrsSY,389600,390880,going to reheat it and then i think
JLIIR-KrsSY,390880,392319,we'll try this too because it's not
JLIIR-KrsSY,392319,393680,something you see every day in vietnam

JLIIR-KrsSY,396000,398240,is wrapped up in a landlord leaf right
JLIIR-KrsSY,398240,399840,here this is what the bola load looks
JLIIR-KrsSY,399840,401600,like before it is grilled he's putting
JLIIR-KrsSY,401600,403440,some oil on there and then transferring
JLIIR-KrsSY,403440,404880,it to the grill and that is going to
JLIIR-KrsSY,404880,406639,cook up beautifully all right let's go i

JLIIR-KrsSY,412240,413919,this first it is a ground beef they
JLIIR-KrsSY,413919,415919,mixed with delicious spices they've
JLIIR-KrsSY,415919,417840,formed it around here it's almost like a
JLIIR-KrsSY,417840,419919,vietnamese kebab i want to try it just
JLIIR-KrsSY,419919,423690,how it is let's go for it
JLIIR-KrsSY,423690,425039,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,425039,427120,oh yeah you can tell there's fish sauce
JLIIR-KrsSY,427120,428960,in the meat because it's so sweet it's
JLIIR-KrsSY,428960,430880,got this umami kind of savoriness to it
JLIIR-KrsSY,430880,432400,you can see how it's just wrapped around
JLIIR-KrsSY,432400,433840,the lemongrass so wonderfully and it
JLIIR-KrsSY,433840,435199,picks up a little bit of flavor from the
JLIIR-KrsSY,435199,437039,lemongrass too this is so good i don't
JLIIR-KrsSY,437039,439759,think it needs any sauce added to it
JLIIR-KrsSY,439759,441759,happiness over here
JLIIR-KrsSY,441759,443199,they've got four of them together on a
JLIIR-KrsSY,443199,445120,stick each stick is about a dollar which
JLIIR-KrsSY,445120,447919,is a great deal too
JLIIR-KrsSY,448479,450400,it's sweet it's juicy the leaf is hard
JLIIR-KrsSY,450400,451840,to describe i mean i could just say the
JLIIR-KrsSY,451840,453520,exact name but if you've never tried it
JLIIR-KrsSY,453520,454720,it wouldn't mean anything to you it's
JLIIR-KrsSY,454720,456800,just very fragrant and aromatic and it
JLIIR-KrsSY,456800,458639,adds its own flavor to the meat itself
JLIIR-KrsSY,458639,461280,like a little meat cigar
JLIIR-KrsSY,461280,463280,time to light up baby over here the
JLIIR-KrsSY,463280,465039,octopus i'm gonna rip off one of these

JLIIR-KrsSY,470319,472080,gonna put in this green chili sauce stop
JLIIR-KrsSY,472080,475280,some of that up and take it down
JLIIR-KrsSY,476240,477919,i know a lot of americans know calamari
JLIIR-KrsSY,477919,479120,and unfortunately they just know like
JLIIR-KrsSY,479120,480960,that one version of squid which is kind
JLIIR-KrsSY,480960,482960,of cut up and fried but grilled octopus
JLIIR-KrsSY,482960,484560,it's so incredible this chili sauce it
JLIIR-KrsSY,484560,486240,is so fresh so spicy and that's
JLIIR-KrsSY,486240,487440,combining with the sauce they put on
JLIIR-KrsSY,487440,489280,there already incredible fresh seafood
JLIIR-KrsSY,489280,490479,right here in this market we've gone
JLIIR-KrsSY,490479,492479,from eggs wrapped in hot dogs to this so
JLIIR-KrsSY,492479,493840,far in just a little bit of time i think
JLIIR-KrsSY,493840,495199,we're doing great let's keep this train
JLIIR-KrsSY,495199,496860,moving
JLIIR-KrsSY,496860,499199,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,499199,500720,right here we have our next food this is
JLIIR-KrsSY,500720,502000,something i did not expect to see in
JLIIR-KrsSY,502000,503599,this market it is sea urchin but let me
JLIIR-KrsSY,503599,504800,show you how they make it the first
JLIIR-KrsSY,504800,506240,thing he does he puts it on the grill
JLIIR-KrsSY,506240,508240,and then he cracks a quail egg into it
JLIIR-KrsSY,508240,509599,and he lights up his torch and he
JLIIR-KrsSY,509599,511440,torches it from the bottom getting the
JLIIR-KrsSY,511440,513360,whole thing to kind of start boiling up
JLIIR-KrsSY,513360,515360,cooking the egg inside next step he's
JLIIR-KrsSY,515360,517360,putting in the cheese we've ordered two
JLIIR-KrsSY,517360,519360,with cheese and two with peanuts so that
JLIIR-KrsSY,519360,521120,is some kind of a liquid cheese like
JLIIR-KrsSY,521120,523039,i've never seen before torches that up
JLIIR-KrsSY,523039,525120,then we've got these green scallions
JLIIR-KrsSY,525120,527839,going in with some scallion oil and some
JLIIR-KrsSY,527839,530080,nice peanuts on top oh yes he's gonna
JLIIR-KrsSY,530080,531760,throw these on the platter bring that to
JLIIR-KrsSY,531760,533279,the table we got ourselves a nice little
JLIIR-KrsSY,533279,535200,treat and now we're back sea urchin is
JLIIR-KrsSY,535200,536640,not my favorite food to me it tastes
JLIIR-KrsSY,536640,538720,kind of metallic but here he's prepared
JLIIR-KrsSY,538720,540160,it in a different way so we have the sea
JLIIR-KrsSY,540160,541839,urchin we have some of the egg and then
JLIIR-KrsSY,541839,543519,some of the cheese on there too some of
JLIIR-KrsSY,543519,545200,the most random ingredients i've ever
JLIIR-KrsSY,545200,546959,seen together moment of truth let's try
JLIIR-KrsSY,546959,549839,it out
JLIIR-KrsSY,550959,552800,oh i like that i cannot guarantee you
JLIIR-KrsSY,552800,554000,that there's sea urchin in here mostly
JLIIR-KrsSY,554000,555600,it just tastes like cheesy almost
JLIIR-KrsSY,555600,557279,mayonnaisey eggs i literally have
JLIIR-KrsSY,557279,558880,scraped everything out of the bottom so
JLIIR-KrsSY,558880,560240,there has to be sea urchin in here let's
JLIIR-KrsSY,560240,563120,try one more bite i think there's a hint
JLIIR-KrsSY,563120,564640,of sea urchin in there it's not a strong
JLIIR-KrsSY,564640,565839,flavor mostly you're getting some of
JLIIR-KrsSY,565839,567360,that really processed cheese which is
JLIIR-KrsSY,567360,568959,actually pretty tasty and then the quail
JLIIR-KrsSY,568959,570800,egg so for one of these it's 50 000
JLIIR-KrsSY,570800,572160,that's about two and a half dollars so
JLIIR-KrsSY,572160,574000,you're paying about one dollar per bite
JLIIR-KrsSY,574000,575680,here that is pretty pricey let's try
JLIIR-KrsSY,575680,577839,this one so this one here is scallion
JLIIR-KrsSY,577839,579519,peanut and sea urchins definitely
JLIIR-KrsSY,579519,581310,there's some sea urchin meat in there
JLIIR-KrsSY,581310,584320,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,584320,585680,that's very nice too wow i'm very
JLIIR-KrsSY,585680,587200,pleasantly surprised by this it's not a
JLIIR-KrsSY,587200,588640,big quantity of food but it's quite
JLIIR-KrsSY,588640,590640,delicious i love the scallion oil flavor
JLIIR-KrsSY,590640,591920,it's one of my favorite flavors or
JLIIR-KrsSY,591920,593519,ingredients of the use of vietnam so it
JLIIR-KrsSY,593519,595040,obviously has that really strong
JLIIR-KrsSY,595040,596800,scallion taste
JLIIR-KrsSY,596800,598160,lots of crunchiness of those nuts and
JLIIR-KrsSY,598160,599920,just a little bit of meatiness from that
JLIIR-KrsSY,599920,601600,sea creature that is awesome and when
JLIIR-KrsSY,601600,603040,you're trying to get up to 100 that is
JLIIR-KrsSY,603040,604399,the way to do it because that's roughly
JLIIR-KrsSY,604399,606560,10 dollars right here for um 10 bites
JLIIR-KrsSY,606560,608320,and all i'm getting slightly full but we
JLIIR-KrsSY,608320,610320,still have a couple more foods to go
JLIIR-KrsSY,610320,611700,let's keep it going
JLIIR-KrsSY,611700,614480,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,614480,616240,boom and we're on to food number nine or
JLIIR-KrsSY,616240,618399,so it is almost 9 00 pm we've been here
JLIIR-KrsSY,618399,620240,for a few hours now rocking the street
JLIIR-KrsSY,620240,622240,food i found another one that i like and
JLIIR-KrsSY,622240,623440,i'm going to try out and then i'm going
JLIIR-KrsSY,623440,625120,to show you it's kind of complicated the
JLIIR-KrsSY,625120,626480,recipe though so let me take you through
JLIIR-KrsSY,626480,628320,it step by step it all starts with an
JLIIR-KrsSY,628320,630320,orange rice paper that she has to spritz
JLIIR-KrsSY,630320,632240,like a house plant from there it gets
JLIIR-KrsSY,632240,634800,one layer of chili salt she spreads out
JLIIR-KrsSY,634800,636880,some beautiful herbs on top a quail egg
JLIIR-KrsSY,636880,638959,gets cut into several pieces next some
JLIIR-KrsSY,638959,641920,scallion oil then crushed peanuts fried
JLIIR-KrsSY,641920,644320,onions some saute sauce and then it's
JLIIR-KrsSY,644320,646399,time for the rolling this is the most
JLIIR-KrsSY,646399,648000,important step it's actually not they're
JLIIR-KrsSY,648000,649680,all important for the texture you want
JLIIR-KrsSY,649680,651519,it to be rolled nice and tight i mean
JLIIR-KrsSY,651519,652959,this is rolled tighter than one of snoop
JLIIR-KrsSY,652959,654720,dogg's joints then she's gonna take him
JLIIR-KrsSY,654720,656560,all cut him with his scissors now she's
JLIIR-KrsSY,656560,658880,putting on some mayonnaise so that is
JLIIR-KrsSY,658880,660160,complete and we're ready to bring it to
JLIIR-KrsSY,660160,662079,the table another vendor another food
JLIIR-KrsSY,662079,664000,this is
JLIIR-KrsSY,664000,665600,so buancheng means rice paper this
JLIIR-KrsSY,665600,667680,orange stuff right here is a rice paper
JLIIR-KrsSY,667680,669680,means the roll chewy rice paper on the
JLIIR-KrsSY,669680,671120,outside and tons of different
JLIIR-KrsSY,671120,672640,interesting fillings on the inside a
JLIIR-KrsSY,672640,674000,little bit of mayonnaise on the top
JLIIR-KrsSY,674000,676000,let's try it out
JLIIR-KrsSY,676000,677600,i love this one and it's hard to explain
JLIIR-KrsSY,677600,678880,why this is a dish very unique to
JLIIR-KrsSY,678880,680560,vietnam served all over the place but
JLIIR-KrsSY,680560,681920,each place they stuff it with slightly
JLIIR-KrsSY,681920,683120,different ingredients or put different
JLIIR-KrsSY,683120,685040,toppings on top but always what i keep
JLIIR-KrsSY,685040,686959,coming back for is that texture it's so
JLIIR-KrsSY,686959,688640,chewy all right i'm breaking off another
JLIIR-KrsSY,688640,691200,piece here oh flavor-wise it's spicy
JLIIR-KrsSY,691200,692560,it's salty then you taste some of the
JLIIR-KrsSY,692560,694480,fresh herbs then you taste creamy quail
JLIIR-KrsSY,694480,696240,eggs then the crunchy onion creamy
JLIIR-KrsSY,696240,697839,mayonnaise on top it is just a
JLIIR-KrsSY,697839,699600,mind-bending experience with all these
JLIIR-KrsSY,699600,701360,flavors and textures together
JLIIR-KrsSY,701360,703600,is street food innovation at its best i

JLIIR-KrsSY,711120,712959,food inside of me here this is something
JLIIR-KrsSY,712959,714240,famous in vietnam and something you
JLIIR-KrsSY,714240,716079,won't find in a lot of places outside of
JLIIR-KrsSY,716079,717200,here because they look at sweets and
JLIIR-KrsSY,717200,718639,desserts a little bit differently first
JLIIR-KrsSY,718639,721120,of all avocado it's blended up into a
JLIIR-KrsSY,721120,723600,puree on top of that coconut three ways
JLIIR-KrsSY,723600,725680,coconut ice cream a sweet shredded
JLIIR-KrsSY,725680,728000,coconut and then a super crispy coconut
JLIIR-KrsSY,728000,729839,on top mixed with some crunchy salty
JLIIR-KrsSY,729839,731839,peanuts it's awesome it's refreshing and
JLIIR-KrsSY,731839,734160,it's 30 000 dong less than a dollar and
JLIIR-KrsSY,734160,735760,a half some ice cream some of the
JLIIR-KrsSY,735760,737360,shredded coconut it's gonna take some
JLIIR-KrsSY,737360,739279,work to even get to the avocado but that
JLIIR-KrsSY,739279,741330,is looking nice
JLIIR-KrsSY,741330,743120,[Music]
JLIIR-KrsSY,743120,745279,oh it's so refreshing so coconutty from
JLIIR-KrsSY,745279,747120,three different coconut attacks i feel
JLIIR-KrsSY,747120,748880,like i could bring to the surface some
JLIIR-KrsSY,748880,751440,of that avocado yeah look at that green
JLIIR-KrsSY,751440,753200,avocado mixed with ice cream and

JLIIR-KrsSY,757120,759120,this is a stunning cup the avocado aside
JLIIR-KrsSY,759120,760399,from the taste you know it has a lot of
JLIIR-KrsSY,760399,762240,natural fats and it's just so creamy
JLIIR-KrsSY,762240,763760,when you mix it with some sugar some ice
JLIIR-KrsSY,763760,765680,cream and some crunchy bits like this oh
JLIIR-KrsSY,765680,768639,my gosh it is priceless and delicious
JLIIR-KrsSY,768639,770320,at the end of a day of long eating if
JLIIR-KrsSY,770320,771760,you're feeling stuffed go with something
JLIIR-KrsSY,771760,773440,like this stomachs always have room for
JLIIR-KrsSY,773440,775760,dessert somehow so that is 10 foods i've
