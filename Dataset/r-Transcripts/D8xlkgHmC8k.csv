D8xlkgHmC8k,77439,81840,so let's talk taikon gts sport turismo
D8xlkgHmC8k,81840,84240,first let's break down that name taikon
D8xlkgHmC8k,84240,86400,porsche's four-door electric car i
D8xlkgHmC8k,86400,87920,reviewed it back when it first came out
D8xlkgHmC8k,87920,90079,now more than two years ago sport
D8xlkgHmC8k,90079,92720,turismo that's porsche speak for wagon
D8xlkgHmC8k,92720,95840,which this is the gts part is new this
D8xlkgHmC8k,95840,98640,is a performance model of the taikan
D8xlkgHmC8k,98640,100560,intended for people who want something a
D8xlkgHmC8k,100560,102880,little more than a regular taikon but
D8xlkgHmC8k,102880,105119,they don't want to pay up for the taikon
D8xlkgHmC8k,105119,107920,turbo and indeed this fits right in the
D8xlkgHmC8k,107920,109759,middle and today i'm going to show you
D8xlkgHmC8k,109759,112000,exactly why first i'll take you on a
D8xlkgHmC8k,112000,114399,quick tour of the taikan gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,114399,116320,sport turismo and i'll show you some of
D8xlkgHmC8k,116320,118719,its quirks and features then i'll get it
D8xlkgHmC8k,118719,120320,out on the road and drive it and then
D8xlkgHmC8k,120320,124600,i'll give it a dug score
D8xlkgHmC8k,130319,132080,all right time for the quirks and
D8xlkgHmC8k,132080,135680,features of the tycon gts sport turismo
D8xlkgHmC8k,135680,137520,now i've already reviewed two different
D8xlkgHmC8k,137520,138879,tycon models so i'm not going to go over
D8xlkgHmC8k,138879,140080,everything but i am going to hit the
D8xlkgHmC8k,140080,142160,highlights starting with one of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,142160,145040,quirkiest quirks i have ever seen and
D8xlkgHmC8k,145040,147599,that would be the panoramic roof in this
D8xlkgHmC8k,147599,150480,car it allows you to select the level of
D8xlkgHmC8k,150480,152239,transparency that you want now i've
D8xlkgHmC8k,152239,154239,already shown you similar roof designs
D8xlkgHmC8k,154239,156879,in mclaren models and the toyota venza
D8xlkgHmC8k,156879,159599,strangely enough but this is way
D8xlkgHmC8k,159599,161599,quirkier than any of those alright
D8xlkgHmC8k,161599,163280,starting you can see the panoramic roof
D8xlkgHmC8k,163280,165120,is pretty normal you can see out of it
D8xlkgHmC8k,165120,167280,it just looks like a big glass panel but
D8xlkgHmC8k,167280,169599,if you press the closed tab on this
D8xlkgHmC8k,169599,171760,screen in the infotainment system then
D8xlkgHmC8k,171760,174959,instantly it becomes closed you can't
D8xlkgHmC8k,174959,176879,see out of it at all and you can go
D8xlkgHmC8k,176879,179599,between open and closed and see just how
D8xlkgHmC8k,179599,181280,quickly this happens no more waiting for
D8xlkgHmC8k,181280,184080,like a big sun shade to roll on or roll
D8xlkgHmC8k,184080,186879,off the sunroof instead instantly open
D8xlkgHmC8k,186879,189280,or close that's pretty cool but it gets
D8xlkgHmC8k,189280,191680,even quirkier than that because you can
D8xlkgHmC8k,191680,194560,select just how much of the roof you
D8xlkgHmC8k,194560,197280,want to be transparent or opaque check
D8xlkgHmC8k,197280,199760,this out you slide your finger over this
D8xlkgHmC8k,199760,201840,image of the car from the top down and
D8xlkgHmC8k,201840,204799,the roof corresponds to what you do so
D8xlkgHmC8k,204799,206239,you can have half the roof be
D8xlkgHmC8k,206239,207680,transparent or three quarters of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,207680,209680,roof be transparent or whatever and you
D8xlkgHmC8k,209680,211440,can see just how quickly it responds in
D8xlkgHmC8k,211440,213599,real time it is amazing to watch this
D8xlkgHmC8k,213599,215760,happen you slide your finger forward or
D8xlkgHmC8k,215760,217920,backwards and the roof does the exact
D8xlkgHmC8k,217920,220720,same thing that you have just asked it
D8xlkgHmC8k,220720,223440,to do and it still gets quirkier because
D8xlkgHmC8k,223440,225519,there are two different dimming modes
D8xlkgHmC8k,225519,227440,that are offered by this roof if you
D8xlkgHmC8k,227440,229840,press dimming one then like half of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,229840,231840,panels become transparent and half of
D8xlkgHmC8k,231840,234080,them become opaque in this sort of odd
D8xlkgHmC8k,234080,236319,pattern if you press dimming two then
D8xlkgHmC8k,236319,238239,exactly the opposite happens the ones
D8xlkgHmC8k,238239,240239,that were transparent now opaque and
D8xlkgHmC8k,240239,242239,vice versa and that's the way the roof
D8xlkgHmC8k,242239,244879,works in this car probably the coolest
D8xlkgHmC8k,244879,247439,transparent configurable panoramic roof
D8xlkgHmC8k,247439,250480,i have ever seen in any vehicle frankly
D8xlkgHmC8k,250480,252560,the only drawback to this transparent
D8xlkgHmC8k,252560,254640,roof is that when you're selecting just
D8xlkgHmC8k,254640,256479,how much you want it to be open or
D8xlkgHmC8k,256479,259040,closed you have to start from the back
D8xlkgHmC8k,259040,261600,and go forward meaning you can't have it
D8xlkgHmC8k,261600,263520,transparent in the front and opaque in
D8xlkgHmC8k,263520,265360,the back you're starting in the back and
D8xlkgHmC8k,265360,267520,increasing the transparency as you go
D8xlkgHmC8k,267520,269040,forward and that's kind of a
D8xlkgHmC8k,269040,270320,disappointment because if you have kids
D8xlkgHmC8k,270320,271520,in the back you want to shield from the
D8xlkgHmC8k,271520,273919,sun but you want sun up front well you
D8xlkgHmC8k,273919,275199,can't do that but that's the only
D8xlkgHmC8k,275199,277840,drawback in this otherwise fantastical
D8xlkgHmC8k,277840,280320,and ridiculous roof design but there is
D8xlkgHmC8k,280320,282720,oh so much more to cover when it comes
D8xlkgHmC8k,282720,285919,to the ticon gts so let's talk about the
D8xlkgHmC8k,285919,288240,important stuff the gts is positioned
D8xlkgHmC8k,288240,290880,between the taikon 4s and the ticon
D8xlkgHmC8k,290880,291840,turbo
D8xlkgHmC8k,291840,295600,in the taikon model range now the 4s has
D8xlkgHmC8k,295600,298720,horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque
D8xlkgHmC8k,298720,302960,this the gts has 590 horsepower and 625
D8xlkgHmC8k,302960,305520,pound-feet and the turbo has 615
D8xlkgHmC8k,305520,308240,horsepower and the same 625 pound-feet
D8xlkgHmC8k,308240,310240,so you can see that the gts fits right
D8xlkgHmC8k,310240,312160,in between the 4s and the turbo in fact
D8xlkgHmC8k,312160,314080,kind of almost more on the turbo side of
D8xlkgHmC8k,314080,315759,things which is pretty neat but of
D8xlkgHmC8k,315759,317919,course being a porsche and a performance
D8xlkgHmC8k,317919,320560,oriented one at that the taikon gts is
D8xlkgHmC8k,320560,322720,pretty expensive the 4s model starts
D8xlkgHmC8k,322720,326320,around 105 000 the turbo starts in the
D8xlkgHmC8k,326320,329919,low 150s like 152 000. this starts
D8xlkgHmC8k,329919,334240,around 132 000 for a regular tycon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,334240,336800,sedan or if you want the wagon version
D8xlkgHmC8k,336800,339280,the sport turismo like i have here it's
D8xlkgHmC8k,339280,340720,going to be an extra two thousand
D8xlkgHmC8k,340720,343600,dollars 135 grand of course that's
D8xlkgHmC8k,343600,345520,before options and in porsche world
D8xlkgHmC8k,345520,348400,options are plentiful and so you'll be
D8xlkgHmC8k,348400,350320,spending a lot more but of course you'll
D8xlkgHmC8k,350320,352080,be getting a lot and that includes some
D8xlkgHmC8k,352080,354400,insane acceleration numbers porsche says
D8xlkgHmC8k,354400,357280,the regular tycon 4s to 0-60 about 3.8
D8xlkgHmC8k,357280,359440,seconds the turbo does it about three
D8xlkgHmC8k,359440,363280,this is 3.2 seconds 0-60 which is a very
D8xlkgHmC8k,363280,365120,very impressive figure and porsche
D8xlkgHmC8k,365120,366960,pointed out to me that the taikon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,366960,369520,sedan and the sport turismo have the
D8xlkgHmC8k,369520,371680,same acceleration figures so if you do
D8xlkgHmC8k,371680,373280,get the wagon you want a little extra
D8xlkgHmC8k,373280,375600,practicality you won't be penalized in
D8xlkgHmC8k,375600,377199,terms of performance or at least not in
D8xlkgHmC8k,377199,379199,terms of acceleration and there are many
D8xlkgHmC8k,379199,381199,other benefits to the tycon gts than
D8xlkgHmC8k,381199,383280,just extra power i'm going to go through
D8xlkgHmC8k,383280,386240,a few of them one is retooled electric
D8xlkgHmC8k,386240,388400,motors porsche told me better cooling i
D8xlkgHmC8k,388400,390720,guess to ensure the motors won't go into
D8xlkgHmC8k,390720,392960,like a limp mode if you're driving the
D8xlkgHmC8k,392960,395120,car really hard on the racetrack in fact
D8xlkgHmC8k,395120,397120,porsche told me they haven't actually
D8xlkgHmC8k,397120,400080,seen that happen driving the taikon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,400080,402240,on race laps the motors are able to
D8xlkgHmC8k,402240,403919,handle really heavy abuse and high
D8xlkgHmC8k,403919,406000,performance driving porsche also told me
D8xlkgHmC8k,406000,407919,that to go along with the extra power of
D8xlkgHmC8k,407919,410479,the gts the extra sportiness that the
D8xlkgHmC8k,410479,412240,brakes are bigger than they are on the
D8xlkgHmC8k,412240,414479,tycon 4s they're not quite as big as the
D8xlkgHmC8k,414479,416639,brakes in the taikon turbo but they're
D8xlkgHmC8k,416639,418400,still bigger for better stopping power
D8xlkgHmC8k,418400,420560,which is important for a performance car
D8xlkgHmC8k,420560,422240,but anyway moving beyond performance
D8xlkgHmC8k,422240,424080,there are quite a few more benefits to
D8xlkgHmC8k,424080,425919,the taikon gts and probably the most
D8xlkgHmC8k,425919,428800,notable is to the wagon body style this
D8xlkgHmC8k,428800,432000,is a sport turismo whereas other tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,432000,435840,wagon models are cross turismos now this
D8xlkgHmC8k,435840,438000,may sound like a stupid semantic
D8xlkgHmC8k,438000,439440,difference and frankly you're forgiven
D8xlkgHmC8k,439440,441759,if you can't keep all these porsche body
D8xlkgHmC8k,441759,444160,styles separate in your mind but it is
D8xlkgHmC8k,444160,445759,actually a meaningful difference the
D8xlkgHmC8k,445759,448319,cross turisma models have like a raised
D8xlkgHmC8k,448319,450639,right height extra body cladding they
D8xlkgHmC8k,450639,453919,look almost off-roady this ditches all
D8xlkgHmC8k,453919,455440,that stuff that is intended to be a
D8xlkgHmC8k,455440,458240,performance wagon and nothing else it
D8xlkgHmC8k,458240,460479,doesn't have like a gravel mode like the
D8xlkgHmC8k,460479,463199,cross turismo models have it is purely a
D8xlkgHmC8k,463199,465919,wagon with performance credentials and
D8xlkgHmC8k,465919,468000,important to point out this is the only
D8xlkgHmC8k,468000,470479,model that comes in the sport turismo
D8xlkgHmC8k,470479,473440,body style all of the other tycon wagons
D8xlkgHmC8k,473440,475680,are cross turismos even the turbo so if
D8xlkgHmC8k,475680,478000,you want the sportiest porsche tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,478000,480800,wagon that would be the gts sport
D8xlkgHmC8k,480800,483120,turismo and the especially cool thing is
D8xlkgHmC8k,483120,484560,with the sport turismo you're not
D8xlkgHmC8k,484560,486400,getting any of the cross turismo's
D8xlkgHmC8k,486400,488400,off-roady benefits but you're still
D8xlkgHmC8k,488400,490560,getting basically all of the added
D8xlkgHmC8k,490560,492400,practicalities since the body is the
D8xlkgHmC8k,492400,495120,same so that means 42 cubic feet of
D8xlkgHmC8k,495120,497280,cargo space which is an excellent figure
D8xlkgHmC8k,497280,499919,and it also means extra rear headroom
D8xlkgHmC8k,499919,501759,porsche says three and a half inches
D8xlkgHmC8k,501759,504560,more rear headroom than the taikon sedan
D8xlkgHmC8k,504560,506479,with its sloping roof that's a pretty
D8xlkgHmC8k,506479,508720,big deal and allows for taller adults to
D8xlkgHmC8k,508720,510479,sit in the back seat more comfortably
D8xlkgHmC8k,510479,511680,and of course there are many more
D8xlkgHmC8k,511680,513839,cosmetic upgrades to the gts than just
D8xlkgHmC8k,513839,516640,the sport turismo body style one you'll
D8xlkgHmC8k,516640,518479,see up front where it has the sport
D8xlkgHmC8k,518479,520959,design front end porsche calls it this
D8xlkgHmC8k,520959,522800,is a more aggressive front end than the
D8xlkgHmC8k,522800,524240,standard tycoon it's offered as an
D8xlkgHmC8k,524240,526080,option on other tycon models but it's
D8xlkgHmC8k,526080,527920,standard here on the gts and it's the
D8xlkgHmC8k,527920,529920,same deal around bat porsche tells me
D8xlkgHmC8k,529920,531600,this is roughly the same rear end design
D8xlkgHmC8k,531600,533279,as the ticon turbo so it's like more
D8xlkgHmC8k,533279,535279,aggressive than what you get in the 4s
D8xlkgHmC8k,535279,538080,and it looks more exciting and sporty
D8xlkgHmC8k,538080,539760,also around back another benefit of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,539760,542480,gts model is a body colored spoiler
D8xlkgHmC8k,542480,545040,which is not on the other cross turismo
D8xlkgHmC8k,545040,546959,models the body colored spoiler looks a
D8xlkgHmC8k,546959,549519,little bit sportier the gts also has its
D8xlkgHmC8k,549519,551760,own unique wheel designs this design and
D8xlkgHmC8k,551760,553600,there's also another one available these
D8xlkgHmC8k,553600,555600,are not shared with other tycon models
D8xlkgHmC8k,555600,557200,they're unique to the gts and you can
D8xlkgHmC8k,557200,559120,see they are painted black which is sort
D8xlkgHmC8k,559120,561120,of a gts theme there's all sorts of
D8xlkgHmC8k,561120,563279,black accents on the outside of this car
D8xlkgHmC8k,563279,565040,where you might find chrome or body
D8xlkgHmC8k,565040,567360,color on a normal ticon everything is
D8xlkgHmC8k,567360,569120,black here which is sort of a theme in
D8xlkgHmC8k,569120,571440,porsche gts models in general this black
D8xlkgHmC8k,571440,574080,trim to make them look sportier because
D8xlkgHmC8k,574080,576320,well they are sportier and also keeping
D8xlkgHmC8k,576320,578720,with the black theme for the gts you
D8xlkgHmC8k,578720,581519,have on the side these black side skirts
D8xlkgHmC8k,581519,583200,which look pretty cool and at the back
D8xlkgHmC8k,583200,584399,they say
D8xlkgHmC8k,584399,587760,gts just a reminder to people looking
D8xlkgHmC8k,587760,590000,that you have the performancy model and
D8xlkgHmC8k,590000,592560,next up we move inside the tycon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,592560,594560,where there are some gts interior
D8xlkgHmC8k,594560,596080,changes as well for one thing you can
D8xlkgHmC8k,596080,598160,see there's alcantara everywhere the
D8xlkgHmC8k,598160,600320,seat centers are alcantara in the middle
D8xlkgHmC8k,600320,603040,there's alcantara all over the dashboard
D8xlkgHmC8k,603040,605680,and the center the center armrest the
D8xlkgHmC8k,605680,608320,door panels are all alcantara and even
D8xlkgHmC8k,608320,610399,the steering wheel is alcantara porsche
D8xlkgHmC8k,610399,613200,calls this material race texts
D8xlkgHmC8k,613200,615279,and it's kind of a hallmark of their gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,615279,617040,models but the rest of us call it
D8xlkgHmC8k,617040,618720,alcantara and it's basically everywhere
D8xlkgHmC8k,618720,620959,in here and speaking of materials and
D8xlkgHmC8k,620959,623360,textiles in here there is some red
D8xlkgHmC8k,623360,625440,contrast accents to match the exterior
D8xlkgHmC8k,625440,627040,color you can see the stitching on the
D8xlkgHmC8k,627040,629040,door panel for instance and the seat
D8xlkgHmC8k,629040,631120,belts are red also but maybe most
D8xlkgHmC8k,631120,633680,importantly gts is stitched into the
D8xlkgHmC8k,633680,636000,headrest again reminding you that you
D8xlkgHmC8k,636000,638160,have the cool one now another
D8xlkgHmC8k,638160,640320,interesting item on the inside is the
D8xlkgHmC8k,640320,643440,sound this car comes with like a sporty
D8xlkgHmC8k,643440,645440,driving sound even though it's an
D8xlkgHmC8k,645440,647040,electric car and would otherwise be
D8xlkgHmC8k,647040,649600,silent they add a fake sound and for the
D8xlkgHmC8k,649600,653200,gts it's sportier than in other tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,653200,655120,models it's still the same basic sound
D8xlkgHmC8k,655120,657519,but it's like deeper and growlier and
D8xlkgHmC8k,657519,658880,you can hear it when you accelerate and
D8xlkgHmC8k,658880,663600,break take a listen to the gts sound
D8xlkgHmC8k,664980,668539,[Music]
D8xlkgHmC8k,672399,674320,now it's worth noting that you can turn
D8xlkgHmC8k,674320,676320,off that sound if you don't want it you
D8xlkgHmC8k,676320,678720,can drive along silently if you wish but
D8xlkgHmC8k,678720,681120,it's there if you want the sporty sound
D8xlkgHmC8k,681120,683600,and you can toggle it on or off now one
D8xlkgHmC8k,683600,685680,other gts item that's standard in this
D8xlkgHmC8k,685680,688240,car is the sport chrono package which is
D8xlkgHmC8k,688240,690560,a series of sporty upgrades and
D8xlkgHmC8k,690560,693360,technology including this clock mounted
D8xlkgHmC8k,693360,694480,on the dashboard which actually
D8xlkgHmC8k,694480,696800,functions as a lap timer when you have
D8xlkgHmC8k,696800,698720,the lap timer going the sport chrono
D8xlkgHmC8k,698720,700320,package is optional on other tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,700320,702480,models but it is standard in the gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,702480,704399,since this is the sporty one but anyway
D8xlkgHmC8k,704399,706240,those are the major quirks of the gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,706240,707600,and the differences compared to the
D8xlkgHmC8k,707600,709760,standard model next i want to move on to
D8xlkgHmC8k,709760,712000,some just general tycon quirks like i've
D8xlkgHmC8k,712000,713600,mentioned i already have reviewed
D8xlkgHmC8k,713600,715200,several ticon models but i want to talk
D8xlkgHmC8k,715200,716560,about some of the basics the most
D8xlkgHmC8k,716560,718079,important stuff and that means starting
D8xlkgHmC8k,718079,721600,with the screen screens are a major
D8xlkgHmC8k,721600,723360,theme in this car they are everywhere in
D8xlkgHmC8k,723360,725200,this interior as you can see screens
D8xlkgHmC8k,725200,727120,screen screens and there's screens for
D8xlkgHmC8k,727120,728639,just about every function for instance
D8xlkgHmC8k,728639,730720,your climate controls are on a screen in
D8xlkgHmC8k,730720,732320,the center control stack here they're
D8xlkgHmC8k,732320,733760,not physical buttons you adjust
D8xlkgHmC8k,733760,735360,everything on this screen now that also
D8xlkgHmC8k,735360,737360,includes the heated seats which normally
D8xlkgHmC8k,737360,739279,i don't like to see on a screen but the
D8xlkgHmC8k,739279,740320,cool thing in this case is their
D8xlkgHmC8k,740320,741839,position is fixed in place so they're
D8xlkgHmC8k,741839,743360,always exactly where you'd expect them
D8xlkgHmC8k,743360,744880,to be when you want to turn them on you
D8xlkgHmC8k,744880,746480,just tap it and they're on which is
D8xlkgHmC8k,746480,748399,pretty nice amazingly the climate
D8xlkgHmC8k,748399,750880,controls also require you to do a pretty
D8xlkgHmC8k,750880,753600,insane thing with the screens and that
D8xlkgHmC8k,753600,756480,would be adjusting the positioning of
D8xlkgHmC8k,756480,758320,the climate vent so you can see the
D8xlkgHmC8k,758320,759920,climate vents here look like they have a
D8xlkgHmC8k,759920,761200,switch where you can adjust the position
D8xlkgHmC8k,761200,762639,but that's actually fixed in place you
D8xlkgHmC8k,762639,764720,move it and nothing happens you have to
D8xlkgHmC8k,764720,767519,go into the screen and then you can move
D8xlkgHmC8k,767519,769440,around these little circles that show
D8xlkgHmC8k,769440,771680,where the air is going and that's the
D8xlkgHmC8k,771680,774399,only way to change the position of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,774399,776480,climate vents in this car you have to
D8xlkgHmC8k,776480,779600,use a screen even for that simple task
D8xlkgHmC8k,779600,782000,just moving the vents if you want air
D8xlkgHmC8k,782000,783519,blowing like on your chest or your neck
D8xlkgHmC8k,783519,785920,or your head you got to do it in the
D8xlkgHmC8k,785920,788639,screen which is crazy and the screens
D8xlkgHmC8k,788639,790880,continue from there check this out the
D8xlkgHmC8k,790880,792720,passenger has a screen over on the
D8xlkgHmC8k,792720,794399,passenger side of the dashboard there is
D8xlkgHmC8k,794399,797120,a screen integrated in here for the
D8xlkgHmC8k,797120,799120,passenger to use so the passenger can
D8xlkgHmC8k,799120,802480,adjust media music navigation phone all
D8xlkgHmC8k,802480,804240,from the passenger seat without reaching
D8xlkgHmC8k,804240,807040,eight inches further over to the center
D8xlkgHmC8k,807040,808959,to use the center screen the cool
D8xlkgHmC8k,808959,810560,benefit here though is you can have
D8xlkgHmC8k,810560,812720,multiple things up on screens at once
D8xlkgHmC8k,812720,814000,without having to go through different
D8xlkgHmC8k,814000,815760,menus the passenger screen can show your
D8xlkgHmC8k,815760,818000,music the center screen your map the
D8xlkgHmC8k,818000,819839,gauge cluster screen can show your phone
D8xlkgHmC8k,819839,821519,and then you have everything displayed
D8xlkgHmC8k,821519,823519,at once which is kind of a neat touch
D8xlkgHmC8k,823519,825839,but the result is screens screens
D8xlkgHmC8k,825839,828720,screens in this interior couple quirky
D8xlkgHmC8k,828720,830320,items that aren't screens for one the
D8xlkgHmC8k,830320,832079,start stop button to the left of the
D8xlkgHmC8k,832079,833839,steering wheel as is porsche tradition
D8xlkgHmC8k,833839,835839,but it's not a key you turn anymore it's
D8xlkgHmC8k,835839,837839,a little circular button you press to
D8xlkgHmC8k,837839,839279,the right of the steering wheel you have
D8xlkgHmC8k,839279,841360,the gear selector which is bizarre it's
D8xlkgHmC8k,841360,843839,this tiny little stubby thing that you
D8xlkgHmC8k,843839,846320,push down to go into drive and you push
D8xlkgHmC8k,846320,848160,up to go into reverse and then you can
D8xlkgHmC8k,848160,850160,see park is this little button over on
D8xlkgHmC8k,850160,852320,the side kind of an unorthodox gear
D8xlkgHmC8k,852320,853760,lever but that's what you get in the
D8xlkgHmC8k,853760,856000,tycon and next up we move on to the back
D8xlkgHmC8k,856000,858320,seat in the ticon gts where you will
D8xlkgHmC8k,858320,860959,quickly discover that headroom is indeed
D8xlkgHmC8k,860959,862240,quite nice especially with this glass
D8xlkgHmC8k,862240,863760,roof which is thinner than like a full
D8xlkgHmC8k,863760,865839,metal roof i sit back here and i have no
D8xlkgHmC8k,865839,867440,real problem we've been sitting really
D8xlkgHmC8k,867440,869600,high my head doesn't hit the roof and
D8xlkgHmC8k,869600,872000,that is pretty cool although it is worth
D8xlkgHmC8k,872000,873760,pointing out that legroom is a bit tight
D8xlkgHmC8k,873760,875839,if you're taller back here this isn't a
D8xlkgHmC8k,875839,878560,huge car not as big as the panamera but
D8xlkgHmC8k,878560,880320,it's big enough for an adult and with
D8xlkgHmC8k,880320,882240,the roofline flattened out on the sport
D8xlkgHmC8k,882240,884720,turismo it's bigger than before however
D8xlkgHmC8k,884720,886800,i should point out that porsche has
D8xlkgHmC8k,886800,889040,three seat belts back here for three
D8xlkgHmC8k,889040,891199,occupants including a middle passenger i
D8xlkgHmC8k,891199,893360,can't imagine how that would work not
D8xlkgHmC8k,893360,895600,only is it relatively tight but this
D8xlkgHmC8k,895600,898399,center hump on the floor is pretty wide
D8xlkgHmC8k,898399,899440,and pretty big and i don't know where
D8xlkgHmC8k,899440,901279,that middle passenger's legs could
D8xlkgHmC8k,901279,903760,possibly go so you can get two back here
D8xlkgHmC8k,903760,905839,relatively comfortably but three would
D8xlkgHmC8k,905839,908000,certainly be a stretch one other very
D8xlkgHmC8k,908000,910240,interesting rear item in this car you do
D8xlkgHmC8k,910240,913360,have rear seat climate controls but they
D8xlkgHmC8k,913360,916160,are also on a screen mirroring what you
D8xlkgHmC8k,916160,917920,see up front you get a screen back here
D8xlkgHmC8k,917920,920079,to adjust fan speed temperature heated
D8xlkgHmC8k,920079,922800,seats that sort of thing and this screen
D8xlkgHmC8k,922800,925600,even changes the positioning of the rear
D8xlkgHmC8k,925600,927199,climate control vents you can't even
D8xlkgHmC8k,927199,929440,adjust the rear vents using your hand
D8xlkgHmC8k,929440,931120,very easily you still have to go into
D8xlkgHmC8k,931120,933839,the rear screen to do that relatively
D8xlkgHmC8k,933839,935920,simple task pretty crazy and next up on
D8xlkgHmC8k,935920,937759,this objective rear seat space let's
D8xlkgHmC8k,937759,940160,talk cargo area space to access the
D8xlkgHmC8k,940160,942480,cargo area you press this little hidden
D8xlkgHmC8k,942480,944000,button on the bumper you can see right
D8xlkgHmC8k,944000,945759,here in the center you push this and
D8xlkgHmC8k,945759,948800,then the tailgate pops open and reveals
D8xlkgHmC8k,948800,951600,the cargo area which is actually pretty
D8xlkgHmC8k,951600,953839,big like i said 42 cubic feet of cargo
D8xlkgHmC8k,953839,955040,space in this car and that includes a
D8xlkgHmC8k,955040,957839,lot of space in this cargo area although
D8xlkgHmC8k,957839,960880,the roof line of the tycon sport turismo
D8xlkgHmC8k,960880,963839,is kind of sloppy it's not as much as
D8xlkgHmC8k,963839,966560,the sedan but it's still not like boxy
D8xlkgHmC8k,966560,968560,like some station wagons are so you do
D8xlkgHmC8k,968560,970320,lose a little space to that if you're
D8xlkgHmC8k,970320,972720,trying to put in some like tall boxy
D8xlkgHmC8k,972720,974560,item also worth noting there is extra
D8xlkgHmC8k,974560,976240,cargo space under the floor you can see
D8xlkgHmC8k,976240,977680,it here the charger stuff is in there
D8xlkgHmC8k,977680,979600,but you do have some additional space
D8xlkgHmC8k,979600,982160,down there and you also have extra space
D8xlkgHmC8k,982160,984560,in front the front trunk can pop open
D8xlkgHmC8k,984560,985440,and then
D8xlkgHmC8k,985440,987600,there's your additional cargo space in
D8xlkgHmC8k,987600,989600,case you run out of room and back or you
D8xlkgHmC8k,989600,991120,just want to separate your cargo for
D8xlkgHmC8k,991120,993440,whatever reason also one other
D8xlkgHmC8k,993440,995519,interesting quirk of the ticon is the
D8xlkgHmC8k,995519,998000,charge port door opening which i just
D8xlkgHmC8k,998000,1000480,find to be fascinating here is the
D8xlkgHmC8k,1000480,1002079,charge port door and you can see there's
D8xlkgHmC8k,1002079,1004240,this little like panel sticking out from
D8xlkgHmC8k,1004240,1007440,it if you slide your finger under that
D8xlkgHmC8k,1007440,1009440,panel with the key in your pocket it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1009440,1011519,will open the charge port door and that
D8xlkgHmC8k,1011519,1013759,door opens like into the fender it sort
D8xlkgHmC8k,1013759,1016720,of hides itself away which is a very
D8xlkgHmC8k,1016720,1019360,very cool touch when you're done with
D8xlkgHmC8k,1019360,1021360,that charge port door you just slide
D8xlkgHmC8k,1021360,1023120,your finger back under the panel and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1023120,1024959,then the charge port door closes right
D8xlkgHmC8k,1024959,1027600,up this is one of the coolest charger
D8xlkgHmC8k,1027600,1030558,door opener situations in the entire car
D8xlkgHmC8k,1030558,1032400,industry i absolutely love it and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1032400,1034079,finally i want to finish this tour of
D8xlkgHmC8k,1034079,1036480,the tycon with a rather interesting
D8xlkgHmC8k,1036480,1039438,thing porsha told me about the tycon and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1039438,1041438,its brand in general porsche told me
D8xlkgHmC8k,1041438,1044000,that over the last 10 years the average
D8xlkgHmC8k,1044000,1046798,buyer age of a new porsche has been
D8xlkgHmC8k,1046798,1049280,increasing by about a year or half a
D8xlkgHmC8k,1049280,1051840,year every single year so every year
D8xlkgHmC8k,1051840,1053600,porsche buyers are getting older and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1053600,1055280,older which makes sense because
D8xlkgHmC8k,1055280,1057120,porsche's cost so much money but it's
D8xlkgHmC8k,1057120,1058880,not really the direction you want to go
D8xlkgHmC8k,1058880,1060400,as a brand you need to be attracting
D8xlkgHmC8k,1060400,1062480,younger buyers but porsche buyers kept
D8xlkgHmC8k,1062480,1064559,getting older until
D8xlkgHmC8k,1064559,1068080,the tycon came out just this model's
D8xlkgHmC8k,1068080,1070559,presence in porsche's lineup lowered the
D8xlkgHmC8k,1070559,1072720,overall average age of a porsche buyer
D8xlkgHmC8k,1072720,1075919,by three years just this one car showing
D8xlkgHmC8k,1075919,1077760,up pretty impressive porsche also tells
D8xlkgHmC8k,1077760,1080559,me that one out of three ticon buyers
D8xlkgHmC8k,1080559,1082320,are new to the brand they're not coming
D8xlkgHmC8k,1082320,1084640,from another 911 or a cayman or whatever
D8xlkgHmC8k,1084640,1086080,getting their seventh porsche they are
D8xlkgHmC8k,1086080,1088080,brand new so the tycon has really
D8xlkgHmC8k,1088080,1090320,allowed porsche to explore spaces where
D8xlkgHmC8k,1090320,1091919,it hasn't been before and it's kind of
D8xlkgHmC8k,1091919,1094160,provided a youthful new energy to
D8xlkgHmC8k,1094160,1096799,porsche as for this particular taikon
D8xlkgHmC8k,1096799,1099360,porsche tells me the gts sedan and sport
D8xlkgHmC8k,1099360,1102160,turismo go on sale this spring or maybe
D8xlkgHmC8k,1102160,1104640,early summer so get ready if you want to
D8xlkgHmC8k,1104640,1106799,get one of these all right driving the
D8xlkgHmC8k,1106799,1109620,taikon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,1109620,1112160,[Music]
D8xlkgHmC8k,1112160,1115280,this thing is fast fast fast the third
D8xlkgHmC8k,1115280,1116960,ticon i've driven the original the first
D8xlkgHmC8k,1116960,1118559,one i drove was a turbo acid anchor
D8xlkgHmC8k,1118559,1121360,turbo and that was insane but since then
D8xlkgHmC8k,1121360,1123440,my opinion of insane has changed a
D8xlkgHmC8k,1123440,1125120,little bit because i've driven the rimac
D8xlkgHmC8k,1125120,1126640,never and the model s plaid and other
D8xlkgHmC8k,1126640,1127919,electric cars that are absolutely
D8xlkgHmC8k,1127919,1130240,incredibly fast so this also feels
D8xlkgHmC8k,1130240,1131679,absolutely incredibly fast but that's
D8xlkgHmC8k,1131679,1134160,just how expensive electric cars feel
D8xlkgHmC8k,1134160,1136000,now they all do zero to 60 in three
D8xlkgHmC8k,1136000,1137440,seconds it's not really that much of a
D8xlkgHmC8k,1137440,1138640,distinguishing feature but if you're
D8xlkgHmC8k,1138640,1141200,looking for speed this car delivers it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1141200,1143519,the co
D8xlkgHmC8k,1143919,1145120,the other cool things that this car
D8xlkgHmC8k,1145120,1147120,delivers are twofold and i think that
D8xlkgHmC8k,1147120,1149360,this car's really big advantages are in
D8xlkgHmC8k,1149360,1150960,two main ways
D8xlkgHmC8k,1150960,1153600,one is the general driving experience
D8xlkgHmC8k,1153600,1155360,like i said third ticon i've been in now
D8xlkgHmC8k,1155360,1157039,and each one
D8xlkgHmC8k,1157039,1159200,is just a blast to drive and i think
D8xlkgHmC8k,1159200,1160400,this is where some of the tesla people
D8xlkgHmC8k,1160400,1162799,don't quite get it they say oh the tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,1162799,1164799,is so much more expensive than a than a
D8xlkgHmC8k,1164799,1167360,tesla but the 0-60 time is the same so
D8xlkgHmC8k,1167360,1168880,the performance is the same who would
D8xlkgHmC8k,1168880,1170799,spend that much more that's not what
D8xlkgHmC8k,1170799,1172480,porsches are about porsches are quick to
D8xlkgHmC8k,1172480,1173760,accelerate they always have been but
D8xlkgHmC8k,1173760,1175600,that's not the main benefit the main
D8xlkgHmC8k,1175600,1178160,benefit is the steering and handling
D8xlkgHmC8k,1178160,1179280,feel and i think that the really
D8xlkgHmC8k,1179280,1181360,impressive thing that the tycon does is
D8xlkgHmC8k,1181360,1184000,it drives like a porsche the first time
D8xlkgHmC8k,1184000,1186240,i drove this car it was clear it feels
D8xlkgHmC8k,1186240,1188720,like a 911 when you're cruising along
D8xlkgHmC8k,1188720,1191280,and that's hard to do in a four-door car
D8xlkgHmC8k,1191280,1193039,generally but it's especially hard to do
D8xlkgHmC8k,1193039,1194640,an electric car that weighs a lot and it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1194640,1196160,was their first real effort in electric
D8xlkgHmC8k,1196160,1197360,car i mean there's a lot of amazing
D8xlkgHmC8k,1197360,1199360,things about this and they really nailed
D8xlkgHmC8k,1199360,1201039,it the car is super well balanced
D8xlkgHmC8k,1201039,1202480,incredibly well poised steering is
D8xlkgHmC8k,1202480,1204640,fantastic it's very immediate and quick
D8xlkgHmC8k,1204640,1207760,the car is is excellent um when you're
D8xlkgHmC8k,1207760,1210159,cornering completely flat and just a lot
D8xlkgHmC8k,1210159,1212320,a lot a lot of fun the other big benefit
D8xlkgHmC8k,1212320,1214799,of this car especially over tesla
D8xlkgHmC8k,1214799,1217679,is quite simply that it's nicer in here
D8xlkgHmC8k,1217679,1219760,you know porsches aren't cheaper
D8xlkgHmC8k,1219760,1221440,gas-powered porsches aren't cheaper than
D8xlkgHmC8k,1221440,1223679,their rivals either but they generally
D8xlkgHmC8k,1223679,1225120,drive better and they generally have
D8xlkgHmC8k,1225120,1226480,really nice interiors now they're not
D8xlkgHmC8k,1226480,1227919,necessarily the highest quality
D8xlkgHmC8k,1227919,1229919,interiors in terms of like overall
D8xlkgHmC8k,1229919,1231520,materials you're not like bathed in
D8xlkgHmC8k,1231520,1233200,leather whatever but everything in here
D8xlkgHmC8k,1233200,1235679,is like really like taut like everything
D8xlkgHmC8k,1235679,1237840,is screwed together well it's laid out
D8xlkgHmC8k,1237840,1239840,properly it's just like a high quality
D8xlkgHmC8k,1239840,1242480,interior that's going to age well no
D8xlkgHmC8k,1242480,1244559,you're not bathed in fluffy leather and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1244559,1247840,pillowy chairs but it's just really good
D8xlkgHmC8k,1247840,1249520,quality stuff basically everywhere you
D8xlkgHmC8k,1249520,1251360,look and of course the brand name also
D8xlkgHmC8k,1251360,1253039,plays into it porsche has a stronger
D8xlkgHmC8k,1253039,1254559,brand name than tesla even in today's
D8xlkgHmC8k,1254559,1256480,world um and so there's people who are
D8xlkgHmC8k,1256480,1258000,buying the car because they like the
D8xlkgHmC8k,1258000,1259840,thrill of that of having the porsche
D8xlkgHmC8k,1259840,1261520,brand i think it's difficult generally
D8xlkgHmC8k,1261520,1263600,to justify the price point of a hundred
D8xlkgHmC8k,1263600,1265120,and sixty hundred and seventy thousand
D8xlkgHmC8k,1265120,1267600,dollar car but relative to other cars i
D8xlkgHmC8k,1267600,1269120,think that this makes a lot of sense at
D8xlkgHmC8k,1269120,1270640,this price point and frankly that's why
D8xlkgHmC8k,1270640,1272880,a lot of people are buying tycons now i
D8xlkgHmC8k,1272880,1275120,do wanna cover uh driver assist
D8xlkgHmC8k,1275120,1277440,technology or self-driving as it is
D8xlkgHmC8k,1277440,1279600,sometimes erroneously called i guess um
D8xlkgHmC8k,1279600,1281919,in this car a lot of tesla people
D8xlkgHmC8k,1281919,1283039,talking about the tycoon say well the
D8xlkgHmC8k,1283039,1285440,ticon doesn't have autopilot so it's not
D8xlkgHmC8k,1285440,1286960,as good it doesn't have any self-driving
D8xlkgHmC8k,1286960,1288960,any driver assist that's not accurate
D8xlkgHmC8k,1288960,1291120,the the tycon does have a pretty good
D8xlkgHmC8k,1291120,1293760,driver assist system actually but it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1293760,1296240,isn't quite as good as tesla so you can
D8xlkgHmC8k,1296240,1297760,set it it will steer for you it'll
D8xlkgHmC8k,1297760,1299440,accelerate break for you it'll do all
D8xlkgHmC8k,1299440,1301039,that stuff which is all fantastic it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1301039,1303520,will not do two things that tesla does
D8xlkgHmC8k,1303520,1305760,well one is it won't lane change which
D8xlkgHmC8k,1305760,1306799,is a little bit of a disappointment at
D8xlkgHmC8k,1306799,1308320,this price point because mercedes now
D8xlkgHmC8k,1308320,1309840,has lane change and cadillac has it and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1309840,1311280,porsche really ought to the other thing
D8xlkgHmC8k,1311280,1312640,that this system won't do is you can't
D8xlkgHmC8k,1312640,1314400,be hands off the wheel for very long and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1314400,1316240,when you are required to go back
D8xlkgHmC8k,1316240,1318240,hands-on you got to kind of do a little
D8xlkgHmC8k,1318240,1319679,jiggle of the wheel so it knows you're
D8xlkgHmC8k,1319679,1321520,there that's very annoying to me a lot
D8xlkgHmC8k,1321520,1323280,of new cars now have capacitive touch
D8xlkgHmC8k,1323280,1325120,steering wheels so they know when your
D8xlkgHmC8k,1325120,1326799,hand is on the wheel that your hand is
D8xlkgHmC8k,1326799,1328720,on the wheel this car your hand could be
D8xlkgHmC8k,1328720,1329840,on the wheel and it wouldn't know it
D8xlkgHmC8k,1329840,1331440,unless you're doing some sort of even
D8xlkgHmC8k,1331440,1333120,very subtle motion
D8xlkgHmC8k,1333120,1334559,and i don't love that mercedes-benz
D8xlkgHmC8k,1334559,1335679,chrysler they've all figured out this
D8xlkgHmC8k,1335679,1336880,capacitive touch thing and porsche
D8xlkgHmC8k,1336880,1338880,really needs to get with that now tesla
D8xlkgHmC8k,1338880,1340799,also does not have capacitive touch
D8xlkgHmC8k,1340799,1343440,steering wheels yet um but you can keep
D8xlkgHmC8k,1343440,1345120,your hand off the wheel in a tesla for
D8xlkgHmC8k,1345120,1346799,like 45 seconds or like a minute which
D8xlkgHmC8k,1346799,1348720,is pretty good um in this car it's more
D8xlkgHmC8k,1348720,1350400,like 10 or 12 seconds and so it gets
D8xlkgHmC8k,1350400,1351919,annoying to constantly have to go back
D8xlkgHmC8k,1351919,1353919,jiggle go back jiggle but it's a pretty
D8xlkgHmC8k,1353919,1355520,good driver assist system i used in
D8xlkgHmC8k,1355520,1356960,traffic it's great in traffic slows all
D8xlkgHmC8k,1356960,1358799,the way down holds the car for a few
D8xlkgHmC8k,1358799,1360799,seconds then continues on when traffic
D8xlkgHmC8k,1360799,1363120,does um it's really really good i love
D8xlkgHmC8k,1363120,1365039,an enthusiast station wagon i've got one
D8xlkgHmC8k,1365039,1366640,myself i've had several in the past and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1366640,1368559,i love that porsche is continuing that
D8xlkgHmC8k,1368559,1370159,tradition even on like their most
D8xlkgHmC8k,1370159,1372159,futuristic advanced car we're still
D8xlkgHmC8k,1372159,1373760,getting sort of an old-school cool you
D8xlkgHmC8k,1373760,1376799,know car enthusiast wagon and so
D8xlkgHmC8k,1376799,1378960,that's the porsche tycon
D8xlkgHmC8k,1378960,1383039,gts sport turismo there is a lot to love
D8xlkgHmC8k,1383039,1385840,here a wagon with added practicality and
D8xlkgHmC8k,1385840,1388320,great technology and it drives
D8xlkgHmC8k,1388320,1390720,fantastically but it all comes at a
D8xlkgHmC8k,1390720,1393039,pretty steep price still if you're
D8xlkgHmC8k,1393039,1396799,looking for a fantastic enthusiast wagon
D8xlkgHmC8k,1396799,1399039,this is it and now it's time to give
D8xlkgHmC8k,1399039,1403840,this tycon a doug score
D8xlkgHmC8k,1405520,1408400,and the doug score is here the ticon gts
D8xlkgHmC8k,1408400,1411600,sport turismo gets a 71 out of 100 which
D8xlkgHmC8k,1411600,1413600,is the exact same score as the taikon
D8xlkgHmC8k,1413600,1416559,turbo cross turismo i recently reviewed
D8xlkgHmC8k,1416559,1418080,that's no surprise is the differences
D8xlkgHmC8k,1418080,1419600,between the two are relatively minimal
D8xlkgHmC8k,1419600,1421679,the gts drives a little better and looks
D8xlkgHmC8k,1421679,1423200,a little better the turbo is a little
D8xlkgHmC8k,1423200,1424720,quicker and more practical but
D8xlkgHmC8k,1424720,1426240,ultimately none of those small changes
D8xlkgHmC8k,1426240,1427760,are enough to move the needle on the dug
D8xlkgHmC8k,1427760,1430640,score all of these tycon turismo models
D8xlkgHmC8k,1430640,1432240,are pretty cool with a lot of excellent
D8xlkgHmC8k,1432240,1437280,benefits and a big sticker price
