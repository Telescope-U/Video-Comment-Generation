yBbcf95UoSg,197519,203519,the spice comes from i'm not so familiar  with daikon i haven't had it that much  but yeah it's a japanese radish i think
yBbcf95UoSg,203519,210760,and then you have those the seaweed  which adds like tiny bursts of salt in  your mouth

yBbcf95UoSg,241920,247680,i was just gonna say like olympia  usually has meat in it so this is kind  of a surprising alternative
yBbcf95UoSg,247680,253439,really nice substitute  i need a knife you're a filipino mom you  don't need a
yBbcf95UoSg,253439,259919,without knife  eat with your hands  it's not the usual lumpia that you eat
yBbcf95UoSg,259919,268520,because this one has a thicker skin i  don't know what's in it it kind of  tastes like mushroom it is it's  mushrooms yeah yeah
yBbcf95UoSg,268639,273759,manganese pork sausage can we just  appreciate how orange this yolk is

yBbcf95UoSg,286800,293919,have that longanisa that brings me back  to sitting in lola's house with my leg  up  eating longanisa and white rice yeah
yBbcf95UoSg,293919,300240,because children i think this is my  favorite filipino dish right here  longanista tried and true everyone loves
yBbcf95UoSg,300240,307680,it transforms you straight to the  province  [Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,307680,314320,beef heart caldereta of everything here  this is what i'm most excited for i just  had a conversation with my dad asking
yBbcf95UoSg,314320,319919,him where do we get heart because i want  to eat heart more often i mean i've had  it in the past i never had like really
yBbcf95UoSg,319919,327440,good heart made by a nice chef i've had  street food heart which is like  you know right this is like prepared
yBbcf95UoSg,327440,333280,yeah maybe it's marinated in something  beforehand  this is fancy heart that is some bougie
yBbcf95UoSg,333280,340240,looking heart  it doesn't taste like organ meat  sometimes i'm scared of oregon meat  because it has this really strong taste
yBbcf95UoSg,340240,346400,like liver but no this is light it kind  of tastes like a flank steak or  something is it chewy it's a mussel try
yBbcf95UoSg,346400,352160,it mmm it has a slightly gamey flavor  kind of like kidney but it's so much
yBbcf95UoSg,352160,358160,more mild than that it does kind of  taste like a steak more so than like an  organ
yBbcf95UoSg,361520,366960,so remember in sagada the etog the dry  one that's why i'm a
yBbcf95UoSg,367919,374560,this is different this isn't aged over  six months or eight months or something  outside with the maggots it's a clean
yBbcf95UoSg,374560,381840,version is that prosciutto in there it's  like prosciutto right this is the best  dish for me this is the best wow yeah i
yBbcf95UoSg,381840,387919,think the smoked ham also really adds  like a bunch of flavor to it and the  charred asparagus too definitely i like
yBbcf95UoSg,387919,394300,how the smoked flavor hits you on the  back end  it all comes together there's a lot of  flavors
yBbcf95UoSg,394300,405710,[Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,407039,414000,up wake up wake up is it dude  it's for you to wake up if you're sleepy  not when you just woke up
yBbcf95UoSg,414000,420720,i don't know it is in one of my favorite  things about filipino food which is  it is a coconut sauce that's what this
yBbcf95UoSg,420720,425520,is oh is it chicken or pork
yBbcf95UoSg,427360,432800,spicy okay mom yeah it stays on my  throat yeah isn't it chili paste right i
yBbcf95UoSg,432800,438960,didn't know that oh that's good yeah  it's not that spicy she's uh she just  caught it in the wrong tunnel in my
yBbcf95UoSg,438960,444720,throat  wow that's really good  the coconut it kind of dims down the
yBbcf95UoSg,444720,449759,spice right so it like gives it a good  mix you get the mixture of the sweet and  the spice
yBbcf95UoSg,449759,456620,and the creaminess  yeah this is good do you like it it's  right with that this is the seasick rice
yBbcf95UoSg,456620,462479,[Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,462479,469120,so we have the crispy chicharron on top  you got the pickled achara here dude  face is the best part of animals oh yeah
yBbcf95UoSg,469120,475680,wow is there called a muncie in that yes  okay i can taste it there's a calamansi  sauce in it the rice was like sauteed so
yBbcf95UoSg,475680,480879,that it's like crunchy from the from the  pan  yes so you got the totong this is one of
yBbcf95UoSg,480879,498930,my favorite dishes here so far  [Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,500080,505520,all right let's dig into the brazino  i love the charred flavor like that
yBbcf95UoSg,505520,512640,charred flavor mixed with this very just  fresh white milk fish yeah flavor it  just adds so much more body i guess
yBbcf95UoSg,512640,518479,you'd say oh i could taste the bago in  there oh that's crucial that makes it  taste way better do you like it or you
yBbcf95UoSg,518479,525040,haven't grew the palette for it yet  honestly as soon as you said  i made my eye
yBbcf95UoSg,525040,530560,bagong is an acquired taste i hated it  my entire life until i started spending
yBbcf95UoSg,530560,537120,a lot more time in the philippines i  would just force myself to eat it slowly  but surely and now i love it
yBbcf95UoSg,537120,543360,last but not least we have the pancetta  this is interesting because they make  their own noodles and it's kind of like
yBbcf95UoSg,543360,550399,ramen not your typical  like fancy canton this  yeah oh it looks like a soup yeah so
yBbcf95UoSg,550399,556320,watch out for the bog  thank you for here i'll spin it so  preparing me for that yeah it's so
yBbcf95UoSg,556320,561519,interesting though seeing these fancy  filipino dishes you know the more we do  these filipino food tours around
yBbcf95UoSg,561519,569120,california i'm getting used to it to see  fancy philip because yeah filipino  food's not typically like fancy
yBbcf95UoSg,569120,576000,this does taste like kind of like a  mixture between a ramen japanese udon  and it does yeah unseed oh i like this
yBbcf95UoSg,576000,581920,this is comfort food yeah especially on  a day like this all right i could eat a  lot of this oh all right what'd you
yBbcf95UoSg,581920,588640,think mom just the right amount because  it's very rich yeah you don't need to  order too much there is a lot of flavor
yBbcf95UoSg,588640,595120,in each dish yeah i think also this is  just different from the typical filipino  food because there are a lot more
yBbcf95UoSg,595120,601920,different flavors in it plating is  really nice and just the flavors i think  there's a few more elements you know you
yBbcf95UoSg,601920,607200,can get like spicy and creamy sweet and  salty it's very rich
yBbcf95UoSg,607200,612800,flavorful food i would come back again  and i would recommend that if you're in  san francisco and you're looking for

yBbcf95UoSg,1305120,1311120,i don't even know how to explain that  like what what can you relate season  fries to toppings are similar to like
yBbcf95UoSg,1311120,1316640,nachos where they have like the sour  cream the guacamole the jalapeno but the
yBbcf95UoSg,1316640,1322159,sea sig is marinated so well and it's a  little bit vinegary which is so good
yBbcf95UoSg,1322159,1328320,this is perfect  there's a place in pampanga where my  family was born called mexico because
yBbcf95UoSg,1328320,1340960,they always make this joke i'm from  mexico  [Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,1340960,1349039,there you go it was really good it was  good i'm just so proud that filipinos  are actually introducing filipino food
yBbcf95UoSg,1349039,1356400,and culture to the united states and  there's such a huge asian american  community out here so it's really nice
yBbcf95UoSg,1356400,1363100,to be proud of what we grew up with  share it to with the next generation in  a way that people can appreciate it
yBbcf95UoSg,1363100,1368640,[Music]  [Applause]  this place is iconic yes the lines are
yBbcf95UoSg,1368640,1373919,always the longest like they have a lot  of different food truck nights and  evenings like depending on the season
yBbcf95UoSg,1373919,1379039,here and the senior seasig food truck  always has the longest line and it's  like not just filipinos it's like you
yBbcf95UoSg,1379039,1385840,know all kinds of that's great because  that means like our dishes are  undeniably good it transcends culture
yBbcf95UoSg,1385840,1391600,well you know something i noticed that i  need to bring up is i realize after  doing these food vlogs in different
yBbcf95UoSg,1391600,1398159,countries filipinos are kind of like  italians where they're protective and  they get upset if you kind of change
yBbcf95UoSg,1398159,1403919,their food around like in the last video  we did the la food vlog there were a lot  of comments like
yBbcf95UoSg,1403919,1410720,this is not filipino food because you  wouldn't have this or that and it's not  filipino it's fusion or it's filipino
yBbcf95UoSg,1410720,1415760,influencer they don't claim to be like  yeah and this restaurant and most of the
yBbcf95UoSg,1415760,1422240,restaurants we go to around california  they are not classic or traditional  filipino food they are fusions or they
yBbcf95UoSg,1422240,1427919,are modern filipino food personally i  don't think there's anything wrong with  it because you know if you can create a
yBbcf95UoSg,1427919,1434159,business and get creative with your food  and it reaches a different market and  you're getting filipino food on the map
yBbcf95UoSg,1434159,1440720,even if it's not 100 filipino food  that's cool food's an art it's a cool  collab between mexicans and filipinos
yBbcf95UoSg,1440720,1446960,that you got a seasick burrito i mean  come on that's awesome  two great foods filipino and mexican
yBbcf95UoSg,1446960,1452830,food and cultures that are very similar  mixed in one
yBbcf95UoSg,1452830,1466799,[Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,1466799,1473840,so here we are at fob kitchen in north  oakland and this happens to be the  top-rated filipino restaurant in the
yBbcf95UoSg,1473840,1479760,east bay they are under the michelin  guide the only restaurant in the  michelin guy here in the bay area
yBbcf95UoSg,1479760,1486679,technically we aren't in san francisco  we're just 20 minutes away over the  oakland bridge
yBbcf95UoSg,1489200,1495279,why did you decide to open up a  restaurant in oakland as compared to  daly city or san francisco or where all
yBbcf95UoSg,1495279,1502080,the filipinos are so originally a prop  kitchen started off as a pop-up in san  francisco in 2015 it was a pop-up in the
yBbcf95UoSg,1502080,1509039,mission for about two and a half years  during that time i also had kids and  having kids in the city is not a city of
yBbcf95UoSg,1509039,1514559,san francisco having twins in san  francisco is even harder so pushing a  double stroller wasn't to me as cool so
yBbcf95UoSg,1514559,1521600,i decided you know it was time  especially the pop-up was growing it was  getting getting popularity and so i  decided to move it to the east bay you
yBbcf95UoSg,1521600,1527279,know i really wanted to be in thomastown  neighborhood because it was a really  amazing food scene out here
yBbcf95UoSg,1527360,1533039,so we're going to start off with the  encelada long and the sinkamas
yBbcf95UoSg,1535520,1541360,this is the crunchiest salad i've ever  had in my life it's great it's just  crunch on top of crunch on top of crunch
yBbcf95UoSg,1541360,1546720,and then like you said what do you call  it corn what  hornix they're like fried corn typically
yBbcf95UoSg,1546720,1552159,on a salad you would have croutons but  they use the corn nuts
yBbcf95UoSg,1553520,1558880,really good  [Music]  it's like bitter and sour
yBbcf95UoSg,1558880,1566640,i love the lungs  we are on dish number two oh my god
yBbcf95UoSg,1566640,1577360,slow down guys we're at the salads we  haven't even gotten to the entrees yet  [Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,1577360,1582640,it's so crispy you know how sometimes  you're so excited to eat lechon kawali  and then you eat it and it's rubbery
yBbcf95UoSg,1582640,1590480,it's not crispy anymore this is like  rice it's like crispy crunchy on the  outside perfectly soft and tender on the
yBbcf95UoSg,1590480,1596840,inside  let me see if they're telling the truth
yBbcf95UoSg,1599039,1607200,the fat in the middle melts on your  tongue and the outside's really crispy  god man wow let me let me hit this
yBbcf95UoSg,1609679,1616320,you can't talk about it  you can't talk you have to savor it  because it's that good
yBbcf95UoSg,1616690,1622080,[Music]  so now we're about to hit the three most
yBbcf95UoSg,1622080,1627440,classic filipino dishes porka dubbo  sinigang
yBbcf95UoSg,1628640,1634799,oh my gosh  that smell of the coconut and the spice  together
yBbcf95UoSg,1634799,1640559,i can taste it  so good the meat is so soft and there's
yBbcf95UoSg,1640559,1646750,gatta in the adobo so it's like very  milky and just so yummy
yBbcf95UoSg,1646750,1649960,[Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,1652799,1658559,synagogue is just it's the best soup in  the entire world easily
yBbcf95UoSg,1660000,1668440,this is what i expect of filipino food  there's a touch of something else but  the taste is there
yBbcf95UoSg,1678480,1684240,yeah it tastes like prime rib with a  little filipino sauce on it i know this  might shock some people but i've never
yBbcf95UoSg,1684240,1689919,eaten fancy i kind of always skip it but  this one i think is my favorite dish  here
yBbcf95UoSg,1689919,1697720,so my sister and my dad said it's the  best pancake they've ever had their  entire life let's see what this hype is  about
yBbcf95UoSg,1698000,1703440,the consistency of these glass noodles  are just  right
yBbcf95UoSg,1703440,1708000,all right i'm taking into the fresh  mangos right now
yBbcf95UoSg,1709520,1714880,oh that was cooked perfectly  so after talking to the fam we all have
yBbcf95UoSg,1714880,1721919,easily came to the conclusion that this  was the best filipino restaurant we have  been to not only in the bay area but
yBbcf95UoSg,1721919,1728720,including the los angeles food trip it  would be a perfect place to take someone  who's never had filipino food if you
yBbcf95UoSg,1728720,1736350,bring them here they will automatically  enjoy filipino food i think  the last dish
yBbcf95UoSg,1736350,1740910,[Music]
yBbcf95UoSg,1743039,1748399,the meat is just sweet and chewy and  tender and the mix with the garlic rice
yBbcf95UoSg,1748399,1754240,and the egg this is a must this one's a  must what is that one called casinos
yBbcf95UoSg,1754240,1760480,this is top of the line toasty look like  that is just a beautiful piece of meat
yBbcf95UoSg,1760799,1768559,you know the thing is with bob's kitchen  it's just that janice is just so not  pretentious and the food is good and i
yBbcf95UoSg,1768559,1775679,think like it speaks through her food  how good and real and she's not trying  to be anything she's not literally her
yBbcf95UoSg,1775679,1781760,personality and how she is you can like  see it through the food
yBbcf95UoSg,1781760,1786799,if that makes sense right yeah  exactly
yBbcf95UoSg,1788260,1795640,[Music]  just to classify that color
yBbcf95UoSg,1795750,1802320,[Music]  that's your phone
yBbcf95UoSg,1802320,1807440,i want one of those my face  you're like look at me
