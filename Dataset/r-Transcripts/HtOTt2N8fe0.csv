HtOTt2N8fe0,0,7000,Did you know that my first laptop was the Dell Inspiron probably 20 years back.
HtOTt2N8fe0,8000,11000,I bought it in 2002/2003 & it was the Dell Inspiron 14.
HtOTt2N8fe0,12000,17000,This here is the Dell Inspiron 14 [7420] 2022 refresh variant.
HtOTt2N8fe0,18000,21000,And it basically comes with new things.
HtOTt2N8fe0,22000,25000,"In fact, it has something for everyone!"
HtOTt2N8fe0,26000,31000,"A touchscreen, a stylus, ports, the latest Windows 11 etc."
HtOTt2N8fe0,32000,34000,Whatever you want is available in it at a nice price point.
HtOTt2N8fe0,35000,44000,"Let's unbox it. Its packaging is made out of real recyclable material, so it's environment friendly."
HtOTt2N8fe0,45000,47000,Unboxing - Let's see what's there in the box.
HtOTt2N8fe0,53000,59000,You get a 65W charging adapter & nowadays you get small adapters but this is a big one.
HtOTt2N8fe0,60000,69000,There's a small box inside a small box & it has a Stylus!
HtOTt2N8fe0,70000,78000,"It's a stylus & Dell calls it an ""Active Pen'' which you can use while creating digital art."
HtOTt2N8fe0,79000,83000,And you also get its batteries. And there is some documentation.
HtOTt2N8fe0,85000,87000,"Let's keep everything aside, & take a look at the laptop."
HtOTt2N8fe0,91000,105000,This is the laptop & it's a perfect laptop for college students & creators who draw/write.
HtOTt2N8fe0,106000,111000,"In fact, that's why the Dell Inspiron series is popular since it caters to everyone."
HtOTt2N8fe0,114000,116000,Design & Build - It's not that heavy nor is it too light.
HtOTt2N8fe0,117000,120000,It's not thick & not that thin. It's right somewhere in the middle.
HtOTt2N8fe0,121000,128000,The build quality is excellent & you get aluminium casing with air vents below along with speaker grills.
HtOTt2N8fe0,129000,137000,Ports - You get all ports including an HDMI port & 2 USB type C ports with an LED indicator on the left.

HtOTt2N8fe0,156000,167000,Yes! It's a tablet & a laptop! So you can keep it flat or tilt it at 360 degrees.
HtOTt2N8fe0,168000,173000,Interestingly you might find the display to be high.
HtOTt2N8fe0,174000,185000,It's a 16:10 aspect ratio display & the bezels are slim & the top bezel is average sized as it has a webcam.
HtOTt2N8fe0,186000,197000,This is an interesting touchpad. There's no cut on top. But it looks like a slit & has an overall interesting look.
HtOTt2N8fe0,198000,202000,"Generally, the keyboard keys are black but this has grey keys."
HtOTt2N8fe0,203000,209000,And the travel distance is good just like a normal laptop keyboard. It's just grey in colour.
HtOTt2N8fe0,210000,215000,You get a fingerprint scanner on the top right corner.
HtOTt2N8fe0,216000,222000,"Display - Now this is a 14"" FHD+ 16:10 aspect ratio display."
HtOTt2N8fe0,223000,226000,It's an IPS LCD display & it's quite bright for an indoor display.
HtOTt2N8fe0,227000,234000,The display is TUV certified & it has a blue light filter for night use.
HtOTt2N8fe0,235000,240000,"And it has a DC dimming feature just like the smartphones, which makes less screen flicker."

HtOTt2N8fe0,257000,266000,"The RAM variants are 8GB or 16GB, & the storage includes a 256GB or a 512GB SSD."
HtOTt2N8fe0,267000,275000,The prices start from Rs 62-63k & the top variant is priced at Rs 96-97k.
HtOTt2N8fe0,276000,284000,The price isn't that expensive because the features it comes with appeal to everyone.
HtOTt2N8fe0,285000,287000,It's a touchscreen laptop & you get a stylus in the box.

HtOTt2N8fe0,316000,333000,"And if you're working from home, you get a FHD webcam along with 2 microphones that cancel some noise for better meetings/classes."
HtOTt2N8fe0,334000,343000,I like that it has a physical privacy shutter. Meaning the webcam can be shut for your peace of mind.
HtOTt2N8fe0,344000,349000,Yes you get the latest gen processors along with the latest connectivity options.
HtOTt2N8fe0,350000,356000,You get the latest WiFi 6E & BT 5.2
HtOTt2N8fe0,357000,364000,The battery backup is very important & it's good as it's claimed to be 7-9 hours.
HtOTt2N8fe0,365000,370000,"If you buy the i3 variant, you'll get a 9 hour backup. If you buy the i7, then you'd get a 7-7.5 hour backup."
HtOTt2N8fe0,371000,377000,"But whichever variant you buy, you'll get at least 6-7 hours of backup so that's good."
HtOTt2N8fe0,378000,386000,It supports fast charging & you have to turn on a setting. And it goes 0-80% in 1 hour.
HtOTt2N8fe0,387000,393000,This touchpad is a little raised & Dell calls it a seamless touchpad.
HtOTt2N8fe0,394000,402000,"So finally, the Dell Inspiron 14 is a go to laptop for everything!"
HtOTt2N8fe0,403000,410000,"We've unboxed & reviewed many laptops, & I specifically mention them for creators or gamers."
HtOTt2N8fe0,411000,422000,"With this, I'll say it has a mass audience. This is not a performance laptop but for everything else, this is the Dell Inspiron 14 for you!"
HtOTt2N8fe0,423000,426000,That's all for this video until the next one Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!
