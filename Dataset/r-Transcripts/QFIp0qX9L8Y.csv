QFIp0qX9L8Y,80,6080,germany's contribution to collective g7  support of 8.5 billion us dollar over
QFIp0qX9L8Y,6080,12160,the next three to five years  but we won't stop there
QFIp0qX9L8Y,12160,17199,in a joint effort with g7 partners we  are currently working towards additional
QFIp0qX9L8Y,17199,22720,gtps within indonesia india senegal and  vietnam
QFIp0qX9L8Y,22720,29279,the public sector alone will not be able  to close the huge investment gap we  faced in many parts of the world
QFIp0qX9L8Y,29279,34960,this is why we are promoting innovative  instruments  such as the emerging markets climate
QFIp0qX9L8Y,34960,42719,action fund  in order to mobilize private investment  to for sustainable infrastructure
QFIp0qX9L8Y,42719,49680,the g7 is committed to support  the emerging markets climate action fund
QFIp0qX9L8Y,49680,56840,and germany is contributing additional  30 million euro adding to 25 million  euro we have provided last
QFIp0qX9L8Y,56840,62800,year the fund can mobilize up to 50 euro  private capital for every single euro
QFIp0qX9L8Y,62800,70439,public money we provide  with our total contribution of 55  million euro we can mobilize up to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,70439,78080,2.75 billion euro  just like our broader g7 again there our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,78080,84960,work on promoting infrastructure  globally is also affected by the current  geopolitical situation
QFIp0qX9L8Y,84960,91920,we have therefore discussed how our  investment globally in climate neutral  and low carbon energy including gas can
QFIp0qX9L8Y,91920,98799,help us  as a temporary response to russia's use  of energy as a weapon
QFIp0qX9L8Y,98799,103840,given the progress we have achieved time  is ripe to showcase our offer to the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,103840,109280,world under a common roof i'm convinced  the d7 makes a stronger better and more
QFIp0qX9L8Y,109280,114960,convincing offer to partners globally  but beyond steps we have been taken
QFIp0qX9L8Y,114960,120000,this is a long-term undertaking  germany will move this work forward
QFIp0qX9L8Y,120000,126399,beyond the amer summit to make progress  towards an equitable world and i will  hand over
QFIp0qX9L8Y,126399,131440,an even stronger joint initiative to  fumio end of this year
QFIp0qX9L8Y,131440,138239,and now  i would like to  hand over to the united states president
QFIp0qX9L8Y,138239,143840,thank you very much  well good afternoon
QFIp0qX9L8Y,143840,149360,folks  our nations and our world stand at a
QFIp0qX9L8Y,149360,155040,genuine inflection point in history  technology has made our world smaller
QFIp0qX9L8Y,155040,160400,more immediate and more connected  it's opened up incredible opportunities
QFIp0qX9L8Y,160400,165440,but also accelerated challenges  that impact on all of us
QFIp0qX9L8Y,165440,170480,managing global energy needs  taking on the climate crisis dealing
QFIp0qX9L8Y,170480,176720,with the spread of diseases  and the choices we make now  in my view are going to set a direction
QFIp0qX9L8Y,176720,183120,of our world for several generations to  come  these challenges are hard for all of us
QFIp0qX9L8Y,183120,188480,even nations with resources of the g7  but developing countries often lack the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,188480,194000,essential infrastructure to help  navigate global shocks like a pandemic
QFIp0qX9L8Y,194000,199760,so they feel the impacts more acutely  and they have a harder time recovering
QFIp0qX9L8Y,199760,204879,in our deeply connected world  that's not just a humanitarian concern
QFIp0qX9L8Y,204879,211200,it's an economic and a security concern  for all of us  that's why
QFIp0qX9L8Y,211200,216879,one year ago when this group of leaders  met at cornwall  we made a commitment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,216879,223040,the democratic nations of the g7  would step up  step up and provide financing for
QFIp0qX9L8Y,223040,229360,quality  high standard sustainable infrastructure  in developing and middle-income
QFIp0qX9L8Y,229360,235200,countries  what we're doing is fundamentally  different  because it's grounded on our shared
QFIp0qX9L8Y,235200,240720,values of all those representing the  countries and organizations behind me
QFIp0qX9L8Y,240720,247439,is built  using the global best practices  transparency
QFIp0qX9L8Y,247439,253760,partnership  protections for labor and the  environment  we're offering better options for
QFIp0qX9L8Y,253760,259680,countries and for people around the  world  to invest in critical infrastructure  that improves the lives
QFIp0qX9L8Y,259680,265120,their lives  all of our lives and delivers  real gains
QFIp0qX9L8Y,265120,271680,for all of our people not just the g7  all of our people  today we officially launched
QFIp0qX9L8Y,271680,277440,the partnership for global  infrastructure and investment  we collectively have dozens of projects
QFIp0qX9L8Y,277440,283199,already underway around the globe  and i'm proud to announce the united  states will mobilize
QFIp0qX9L8Y,283199,288240,200 billion dollars in public and  private  capital over the next five years for
QFIp0qX9L8Y,288240,294639,that partnership  we're here today because we're making  this commitment together as a g7
QFIp0qX9L8Y,294639,302000,in coordination with one another to  maximize the impact of our work  collectively we aim to mobilize nearly
QFIp0qX9L8Y,302000,307120,600 billion dollars from the g7 by 2027.
QFIp0qX9L8Y,307120,313520,these strategic investments are areas of  critical  to sustainable development and to our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,313520,319199,shared global stability  health  and health security
QFIp0qX9L8Y,319199,324960,digital connectivity  gender equality and equity climate and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,324960,331039,energy security  let me give you some examples of the  kinds of projects that are underway in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,331039,338880,each of these areas  first  health  two years ago cover 19 didn't need any
QFIp0qX9L8Y,338880,346639,reminders about how critical investments  health care systems were  and health sector and health security is
QFIp0qX9L8Y,346639,352720,both to fight the pandemic  and to prepare for the next one because  it will not be the last pandemic we
QFIp0qX9L8Y,352720,359199,under we we have to deal with  that's why the united states together  with g7 partners in the world bank
QFIp0qX9L8Y,359199,365199,are investing in a new industrial scale  vaccine manufacturing facility in  senegal
QFIp0qX9L8Y,365199,371280,when complete will have the potential  produce hundreds of millions of doses of  vaccine annually
QFIp0qX9L8Y,371280,378720,for cover 19 and other diseases  it's an investment that will enhance  global vaccine supplies as well as
QFIp0qX9L8Y,378720,384319,improve access and equity for developing  countries  second
QFIp0qX9L8Y,384319,390400,in the digital area  our economy's future increasingly  depends on people's ability to connect
QFIp0qX9L8Y,390400,395520,to secure information  and communications technologies
QFIp0qX9L8Y,395520,402080,we need to strengthen the use of trusted  technologies so that our online  information cannot be used by autocrats
QFIp0qX9L8Y,402080,407360,to consolidate their power  or  repress their people
QFIp0qX9L8Y,407360,413120,that's why the digital invest program  is mobilizing 335 million dollars in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,413120,420080,private capital  to supply secure network equipment in  africa  asia and latin america
QFIp0qX9L8Y,420080,426080,and the us government also supported the  successful bid  by an american company subcom
QFIp0qX9L8Y,426080,433440,for a 600 million dollar contract  to build a global  subsidy telecommunications cable
QFIp0qX9L8Y,433440,441680,this cable will stretch from southeast  asia through the middle east  and the horn of africa to europe
QFIp0qX9L8Y,441680,448639,this will be essential to meeting the  growing demand for reliable  security high-tech connectivity
QFIp0qX9L8Y,448639,455440,in three key regions of the world  third gender  when women and girls have the ability
QFIp0qX9L8Y,455440,461440,and the opportunity to participate more  fully in their societies and economies
QFIp0qX9L8Y,461440,467039,we see positive impacts not only in  their communities but around the border  across the board
QFIp0qX9L8Y,467039,473039,we have to increase those opportunities  though for women and girls to thrive  including practical steps to make child
QFIp0qX9L8Y,473039,480400,care more accessible and affordable as  we continue the vital work to protect  and advance women's fundamental rights
QFIp0qX9L8Y,480400,488319,the united states is committing 15  million over five years to the world  bank global child care incentive fund
QFIp0qX9L8Y,488319,494479,this public-private partnership  supported by several g-7 partners will  help countries build infrastructure that
QFIp0qX9L8Y,494479,499520,makes it easier for women to participate  equally equally in the labor force
QFIp0qX9L8Y,499520,505360,fourth  and very important climate and energy  we're seeing just how critical this is
QFIp0qX9L8Y,505360,510720,every day  the entire world is feeling the impact  of russia's brutal
QFIp0qX9L8Y,510720,517200,war in ukraine  and on our energy markets  we need worldwide effort to invest in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,517200,522880,transformative clean energy projects to  ensure that critical infrastructure is  resilient
QFIp0qX9L8Y,522880,528640,to changing climate  critical materials that are necessary  for our clean energy transition
QFIp0qX9L8Y,528640,535680,including the production of batteries  need to be developed with high standards  for labor and environment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,535680,541200,fast and reliable transportation  infrastructure including railroads and  ports
QFIp0qX9L8Y,541200,546320,is essential to moving inputs for  refining and processing and expanding
QFIp0qX9L8Y,546320,552320,access to clean energy technologies  for example  the us government just facilitated a new
QFIp0qX9L8Y,552320,559600,partnership between two american firms  and the government of angola  to invest two billion dollars in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,559600,564880,building the new solar projects in  angola  it's a partnership that will help angola
QFIp0qX9L8Y,564880,572560,meet its climate goals and energy needs  while creating new markets for american  technologies and good jobs in angola and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,572560,578000,i suspect throughout africa  and in romania the american company new
QFIp0qX9L8Y,578000,583519,scale power will be the first of its  kind small modular reactor plan
QFIp0qX9L8Y,583519,590720,this will help bring online zero  emission nuclear energy to europe faster  more cheaply and more efficiently
QFIp0qX9L8Y,590720,596000,the us government is helping advance the  development of this groundbreaking  american technology which will
QFIp0qX9L8Y,596000,601120,strengthen europe's energy security and  create thousands of jobs in romania
QFIp0qX9L8Y,601120,607920,and the united states  these deals are just some of what's in  store  and we're ready we're ready to get to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,607920,613200,work together all of us  to lead efforts to lead u.s efforts in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,613200,619600,my case appointed i appointed almost  hochstein my special presidential  coordinator to deal with the rest of our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,619600,625120,colleagues  i'll lead the u.s whole of government  approach to drive a coalition and a
QFIp0qX9L8Y,625120,631360,collaboration  with the g7 and our partners around the  world including private sector and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,631360,637680,multilateral development banks  i want to be clear  this isn't aid or charity
QFIp0qX9L8Y,637680,644079,it's an investment that will deliver  returns for everyone including the  american people and the people of all  our nations
QFIp0qX9L8Y,644079,649440,it'll boost all of our economies  it's a chance for us to share our  positive vision
QFIp0qX9L8Y,649440,655839,for the future and let communities  around the world  see themselves  and see for themselves the concrete
QFIp0qX9L8Y,655839,661440,benefits of partnering with democracies  because when democracies demonstrate
QFIp0qX9L8Y,661440,668240,what we can do all that we have to offer  i have no doubt that we'll win the  competition every time
QFIp0qX9L8Y,668240,674279,thank you now i invite president  vanderline to the podium
QFIp0qX9L8Y,679040,684959,thank you very much joe mr president  thank you olaf underscanzler
QFIp0qX9L8Y,684959,692079,we've just tried to overcome a global  pandemic and it shook  the global economy and then as the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,692079,698079,global economy was just recovering  russia's vicious attack on ukraine  happened
QFIp0qX9L8Y,698079,705600,driving prices up  everywhere from food to energy  and casting deep uncertainty especially
QFIp0qX9L8Y,705600,712560,in the most fragile countries  these are very severe challenges  we will tackle them head on
QFIp0qX9L8Y,712560,719600,and this is why g seven partners are  gathered here  but this must not and it will not divert
QFIp0qX9L8Y,719600,725839,us away from our affirmative agenda  to show the world that democracies when
QFIp0qX9L8Y,725839,733920,they work together  provide the single best path to deliver  results for our people and people all
QFIp0qX9L8Y,733920,739040,over the world  on climate  on health security and on digital
QFIp0qX9L8Y,739040,744160,innovation  and indeed last november at cop26
QFIp0qX9L8Y,744160,751120,thank you again boris for the initiative  we announced our plans to step up  globally investments
QFIp0qX9L8Y,751120,756480,in climate positive infrastructure  this was our response to the commitment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,756480,762560,we made at carbs bay and i will never  forget  the start of this initiative at glasgow
QFIp0qX9L8Y,762560,768240,together with you joe and you boris it  was the beginning of a success story
QFIp0qX9L8Y,768240,774240,today the world needs these investments  more than ever  and that is what the partnership for
QFIp0qX9L8Y,774240,781200,global infrastructure and investment is  all about  so now what should we do
QFIp0qX9L8Y,781200,788079,we should work  side by side  and this is the one and only way to  maximize the potential of our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,788079,793440,investments  and to demonstrate the power of  development finance
QFIp0qX9L8Y,793440,798839,when it reflects democratic values  that is transparency
QFIp0qX9L8Y,798839,804720,inclusivity and sustainability  when it embraces high standards for the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,804720,811040,environment and for the workers  and when it mobilizes the private sector
QFIp0qX9L8Y,811040,817440,that's what success looks like on our  side europe's response to the world's
QFIp0qX9L8Y,817440,824160,investment gap is global gateway  it's going to be under the roof of the  global partnership for infrastructure
QFIp0qX9L8Y,824160,832240,and investment  it's the team europe approach and to the  200 billion eur dollars dollars that
QFIp0qX9L8Y,832240,839440,have just been announced by the  president of the united states  team europe is mobilizing 300 billion
QFIp0qX9L8Y,839440,847360,euros  till 2027 over the next seven years from  both public and private sources
QFIp0qX9L8Y,847360,853199,300 billion euros for sustainable  quality infrastructure
QFIp0qX9L8Y,853199,860399,and also for health infrastructure  investments that are transparent and  that improve everyday lives and bring
QFIp0qX9L8Y,860399,866320,real benefit for the communities on the  ground  global gateway is fully at work and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,866320,872880,we're listening closely to the recipient  countries  so that we can better understand their
QFIp0qX9L8Y,872880,878560,needs and deliver the biggest impact  we already have many great examples to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,878560,884000,share some of them have already been  named the mrna vaccine manufacturing
QFIp0qX9L8Y,884000,889040,plants for example  we just extended this successful program
QFIp0qX9L8Y,889040,895360,to latin america too  but for example also the great green  wall a project for food security and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,895360,900880,land restoration on the continent  or take the submarine fiber optic cable
QFIp0qX9L8Y,900880,906959,ela linking europe to latin america  the upcoming clean hydrogen project with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,906959,912800,egypt namibia and chile  and for example constructing a port to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,912800,918000,connect christmas island in the south  pacific to the rest of the world
QFIp0qX9L8Y,918000,924240,these are projects in the right  direction to travel  they are designed and implemented in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,924240,930240,full consultation and partnership with  the countries and population concerned
QFIp0qX9L8Y,930240,937279,because that's our way to do business  so my point is we need to see more of  these projects get off the ground in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,937279,943199,every corner of the the earth  and for this we really need
QFIp0qX9L8Y,943199,949759,as democracies to pull our common weight  the european union and japan for example
QFIp0qX9L8Y,949759,955279,are already doing that defume you as  part of our connectivity partnership
QFIp0qX9L8Y,955279,960639,or south africa has been named where all  g7  are supporting the just energy
QFIp0qX9L8Y,960639,966639,transition  and we will continue our work and do  more projects together we will optimize
QFIp0qX9L8Y,966639,973759,our collective power  because it is up to us  to give a positive powerful investment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,973759,980480,impulse to the world  to show our partners in the developing  world that they have a choice
QFIp0qX9L8Y,980480,986480,and that we intend to step up in  solidarity to meet their development  needs
QFIp0qX9L8Y,986480,992560,in doing so we'll show once again that  democracies are prepared and meet the  moment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,992560,997839,therefore my dear friends let's continue  the good work thank you
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1005279,1011440,so now i may ask the  prime minister of japan kumar kishida
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1026880,1033438,infrastructure investment is  indispensable for the promotion of  productivity and prosperity across the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1033438,1038640,world infrastructure such as ports and  harbors railways or airports underpin
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1038640,1045360,the lives of the people and economic  activities and will be the foundation of  the country's development
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1045360,1053440,however that does not mean that the  development of a large amount of  infrastructure would suffice even if the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1053440,1058720,initial cost is inexpensive  it may lack
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1058720,1069039,economic efficiency in view of the life  cycle as a whole or  if in feasible debt repayment plans
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1069280,1075840,cause the recipient countries to  default  it would
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1075840,1081440,after all inhibit  the growth of that country therefore
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1081440,1086480,in accordance with the g20 principles  for quality infrastructure investment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1086480,1092080,which incorporate transparency openness  economic efficiency and sustainability
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1092080,1097840,and others it is important for the g7  members to unite and promote
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1097840,1104559,quality  infrastructure investment  from such perspective our country will
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1104559,1110480,announce that in the next five years we  will aim to realize more than 65 billion
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1110480,1115679,dollars of infrastructure assistance and  mobilization of private sector capital
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1115679,1120880,in addition to the challenges such as  covet 19 of climate change at the moment
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1120880,1129280,due to the aggression of ukraine the  global economy is facing price  spikes of energy and food or the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1129280,1135760,disruption of supply chains  in order to deal with these situations
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1135760,1142000,quality infrastructure investment again  is indispensable but the development of
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1142000,1147280,quality infrastructure is also crucial  for the realization of a free and open
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1147280,1152640,indo-pacific for the indo-pacific region  we will work on
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1152640,1159840,railways and airports that contribute to  regional connectivity or the development  of potent harbors for maritime security
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1159840,1165440,and the reinforcement of economic  security including cyber security going
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1165440,1170480,forward japan will execute  international cooperation by
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1170480,1177960,appropriate  efficient and strategic  use of ode

QFIp0qX9L8Y,1204240,1209919,thank you everyone it's good to be here  with president biden chancellor schultz  and everyone participating in this event
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1209919,1215919,today  a year ago at the g7 summit in the uk we  made the commitment to change our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1215919,1223840,approach to investment for  infrastructure with the goal of  strengthening our partnership with  others around the world
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1228880,1235440,work together in order to overcome the  gaps that exist in infrastructure  in developing countries and it's
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1235440,1240960,essential that we do this in order to  promote sustainable development create  jobs and promote
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1240960,1246240,trade whilst protecting the environment  meeting in rwanda with me this week with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1246240,1252799,prime minister boris johnson johnson  where we had the  opportunity to talk about these  challenges with many african leaders and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1252799,1259440,earlier this month in los angeles i met  with my co-chair of the un secretary  general's sustainable development goals
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1259440,1265760,advocates group prime minister mia  motley of barbados  we focused on mobilizing all possible
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1265760,1270880,resources government the private sector  multilateral development banks and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1270880,1276000,philanthropic foundations  since the g7 last year we've made
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1276000,1282880,significant progress together including  commitments to support countries and  managing their own energy transitions
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1282880,1289039,away from coal and other fossil fuels  canada doubled its international climate
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1289039,1294640,finance commitment to 5.3 billion  dollars over five years in large part to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1294640,1302320,support these efforts which include a  one billion dollar investment in the  accelerating coal transition program
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1302320,1308720,of course  if we want to close the infrastructure  gap we have to find ways to incentivize
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1308720,1315919,greater private sector investment  because no amount of public money can  single-handedly fix this issue that's
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1315919,1321200,why at home organizations such as our  development finance institute findev
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1321200,1326640,canada is helping build a blended  finance platform in partnership with key
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1326640,1333200,institutional investors  we're doing this to lower the risks for  private sector partners and put their
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1333200,1339600,capital to work to help solve today's  big problems  canada's private sector is already a
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1339600,1347840,significant investor investor in global  infrastructure and we're going to help  them do even more of it
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1348799,1356480,we know that a great deal of work still  remains to be done by all of us we must  remain focused determined and united and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1356480,1361919,today we reaffirm once again our  commitment is to be our partners to take
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1361919,1368320,forward this infrastructure and  development program development program  i look forward to continue continuing to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1368320,1375080,work with you all during the summit and  mostly over the years to come
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1378720,1385800,now i asked the president of the  european council sean michelle to speak  to us
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1385800,1391919,[Music]  thank you dear chancellor olaf schultz  thank you dear friend of the united
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1391919,1398080,states for designing this event  the eu fully supports the g7 partnership
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1398080,1403360,on global infrastructure investment  and the reason is simple
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1403360,1410240,we have always been a leader in  cooperating with developing countries 46
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1410240,1416799,of global development 8 trumps from the  european union and everywhere almost 70
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1416799,1422880,billion euros go to fund more peace more  prosperity and more development
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1422880,1429200,the g7  is committed to value standards  transparency principles
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1429200,1435840,and so is the eu  we focus  on smart clean and secure investments in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1435840,1441679,sustainable infrastructure in digital  climate energy or transport
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1441679,1448960,and we also invest in the power and  potential of people  in their education and health
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1448960,1454400,and  in cutting-edge research  the eu is a project of peace and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1454400,1460000,prosperity and cut in the rule of law  and multilateralism
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1460000,1468000,we rally our partners around high  standards of human social and workers  rights and our g7 partnership wants to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1468000,1473039,drive forward into a structure that's  sustainable inclusive resilient and high
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1473039,1478400,quality  in emerging markets and in developing  countries
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1478400,1483520,for instance with investments in  vaccines and medicine production notably
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1483520,1489840,in african countries  multilateral development banks will play  a catalyst role in mobilizing private
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1489840,1495760,capital along with our public support  the european union is moving forward
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1495760,1501679,with our global jetwa initiative  at our eu africa summit last february we
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1501679,1507919,announced an africa europe investment  package of 150 billion euros we are
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1507919,1514960,investing in many countries projects  in africa and with africa the submarine
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1514960,1520240,geographical gateway table and the local  pharmaceuticals operation are two good
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1520240,1525840,examples  in the indo-pacific we are very engaged
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1525840,1531440,in the field of sustainable creativity  in transport energy and technology
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1531440,1536880,in conclusion we need values and  standards and that's why we are fully on  board
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1536880,1542400,i believe i am convinced that the g7 and  the eu are taking the right direction
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1542400,1548240,for a more stable and forward-looking  partnership i thank you
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1550799,1557640,the last that will speak here to us is  the prime minister of italy mario dargi
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1559520,1566799,thank you all of just two words after  everything has been said  this group of countries
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1566799,1574080,is being the largest  financier  in assistance to investment projects in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1574080,1581120,developing countries  we have to do more  and we also want to be this effort
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1581120,1588240,widely acknowledged in partnerships  with the developing countries
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1588240,1595120,multilateral development banks and  especially the world bank  will be mobilized even further together
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1595120,1600480,with the private sector  again a wide effort of partnership with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1600480,1605600,developing countries has to be  undertaken
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1605600,1611120,the areas  you've you've heard the many areas in  which these investment projects are
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1611120,1617200,going to be undertaken but on two areas  i want to put more stress  one is energy
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1617200,1623440,and the other one is health care  energy  it's quite clear that in the present
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1623440,1629440,situation  will have short-term needs  that will require
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1629440,1635679,large investments in gas infrastructure  in developing countries and elsewhere
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1635679,1642240,but we have to make sure  that they can be retroverted to  carry hydrogen
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1642240,1647440,so that's a way to reconcile short-term  needs with long-term
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1647440,1654159,climate  needs  and also  many developing countries and one
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1654159,1660960,continent africa  is  exceptionally suited
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1660960,1666399,for investments in renewables  and that's where i would expect all our
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1666399,1673279,countries  to fund  and design  identify and design
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1673279,1678720,many many investment projects in this  area  on vaccines again this group of
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1678720,1684240,countries being the european union and  the united states has been by by far
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1684240,1692799,the largest donor this group of  countries including canada and japan  by far the largest donors of vaccines
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1692799,1699840,and will continue  many initiatives in this field but now  it's clear that more is needed namely to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1699840,1705039,enable african countries and other  countries to produce the vaccines in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1705039,1710240,their own on their own land  so that the vaccine could be readily
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1710240,1714559,available to their people thank you
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1717840,1724559,thank you to you all  so if you're just joining us now we've  been listening to remarks by leaders at
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1724559,1730720,the g7 summit taking place in southern  germany and to unpack some of those
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1730720,1736559,comments and the topics that were  talked about i'm joined now by dws  brussels bureau chief alexander
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1736559,1743279,fundament who was listening to that  press conference from just outside the  summit venue hello to alexandra and with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1743279,1749279,me in the studio is thomas paros dw's  political correspondent thomas um i'd
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1749279,1755200,like to start with you it seems that the  big announcement made by the g7 leaders
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1755200,1760640,was the launch of this partnership for  global infrastructure and investment an
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1760640,1767679,enormous amount of money being put in  that what is the significance of this  initiative on the one hand you have the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1767679,1774320,let's call them more pressing issues  we've been discussing them all day that  have to do with the war in ukraine with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1774320,1782000,russia and so on so sanctions on  military aid but this here is proof that  the g7 goes well beyond those immediate
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1782000,1787440,issues and that it tackles other aspects  as well other challenges as well it's
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1787440,1792640,what ozoola fonda lion actually  described as an affirmative agenda so
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1792640,1798559,basically working with other countries  around the world and some of the big  global challenges president biden of the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1798559,1803919,united states basically stressed that  when it comes to global health
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1803919,1808960,challenges for example or global climate  challenges it's actually some of the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1808960,1814799,developing countries around the world  that face the biggest problems simply  because they haven't got the necessary
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1814799,1822559,infrastructure to deal with these kinds  of challenges and as such that's why the  g7 group have decided to precisely focus
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1822559,1828159,on these issues to try and work hand in  hand with some of those countries around  the world when it comes to gender issues
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1828159,1834960,when it comes to global health when it  comes to climate when it comes to  a wide range of issues each one of those
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1834960,1840720,leaders actually gave concrete examples  of how they are helping  say specific countries or specific
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1840720,1846159,regions in the world one concrete  example was the development of vaccines  in african countries but it basically
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1846159,1852799,shows that in this in the case of the g7  it's not only about discussing the most  pressing issues the most urgent issues
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1852799,1859120,the the issues that everyone is talking  about but there is also about discussing  other aspects that may be on the agenda
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1859120,1864240,and in this particular case this  affirmative agenda that fond de lane  mentioned is specifically this
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1864240,1871679,partnership for global infrastructure  well something else that wonderlion  stressed very much is as she put it
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1871679,1877120,democracies working together provide the  best results the best path for results
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1877120,1883200,for everyone whether it's on climate or  in health or on security  alexandra i couldn't help but think that
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1883200,1888640,this was in some way  a reference to the competing models
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1888640,1893760,of  types of governments and nations that  we're seeing as the world becomes
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1893760,1899440,increasingly polarized so is the  democracies pitting being pit against
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1899440,1904880,the authoritarian states what did you  make about uh what did you make of
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1904880,1910640,ursula fond alliance comments and others  referring to democracies
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1911360,1918080,well i think that you are totally right  of course what we need to understand  that this relaunch of this global
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1918080,1925039,investment  infrastructure  and investment program this is aimed at
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1925039,1930320,countering china's influence that is why  not only european uh commission
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1930320,1937120,president ozark rosella from the line  but also you ask president joe biden  that both stress as well as other
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1937120,1942720,leaders there that  they  want to advance democracies in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1942720,1949600,developing countries that this whole  program is based on shirt values they
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1949600,1955840,want to promote for instance gender  equality  they want investments in green
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1955840,1963760,technologies and they don't want any  strings to be attached to this help and
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1963760,1970080,this investments and this is meant  clearly to be an alternative to china's
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1970080,1976080,belt and road initiative that has been  criticized as a tool for the chinese
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1976080,1984399,government to  to advance its interests and of course  enhance its influence worldwide and we
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1984399,1992000,had a lot of examples that for instance  countries who borrowed money to be able
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1992000,1999120,to participate in this belt and road  initiative ended up  in deep debts so
QFIp0qX9L8Y,1999120,2005279,that is this promise by the g7 leaders  that this is not going to be to be
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2005279,2012399,happening with developing countries  participating  in this partnership however let me just
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2012399,2018559,add this of course we are going to we  are speaking here about 600 billion us
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2018559,2024559,dollars as you as president joe biden  said but this is still not enough money
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2024559,2031919,compared with what china is investing  and that is why  the leaders stressed that it cannot be
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2031919,2039279,only about public funding  they need private funding as well
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2039279,2045919,and now thomas we also heard from joe  biden talking about how the choices that
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2045919,2052638,are now being made will set the  direction of the world for generations  um how else can
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2052638,2059200,g7 nations  you know shift to the direction of the  world through these investments well one
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2059200,2065839,thing before i i addressed that because  alexandra's comment just now reminded me  of a sentence that actually stuck with
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2065839,2072240,me i think he was from mosul von der  line when she said this is how we do  business so basically presenting those
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2072240,2079760,those projects and i couldn't agree with  alexandra more that this is  certainly uh a sort of parallel or a or
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2079760,2086720,a contrasting project when you look at  china's belt and road initiative it is  the way in which these groups of nations
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2086720,2093679,want to do business they want to  cooperate with other countries around  the world this is also not exempt of  controversy but they're basically trying
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2093679,2098960,to focus on certain areas where they can  cooperate with countries around the  world that can also help
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2098960,2105119,them in one way or another so joe biden  clearly stressing that this was not  aid that they were giving countries  around the world that this was something
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2105119,2110480,that will ultimately benefit these  countries as well that are talking that  they would also refer to their own
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2110480,2116720,security and their own well-being so  when you talk about renewable energies  when you talk about climate proposals in
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2116720,2122320,general when you talk about global  health and the pandemic that we've just  had these are all issues and i think
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2122320,2128160,there is a clear understanding among  these group of leaders that the problems  that affect one group of nations around
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2128160,2134160,the world certainly can have an impact  thousands of kilometers or thousands of  miles far away and that's why there is
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2134160,2140720,this need to cooperate on projects and  in this particular case we're talking  about seven countries that do have a lot
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2140720,2146400,of money at their disposal and that  certainly can bring about some of those  projects that they that they discuss
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2146400,2151839,whether it's putting solar panels in one  country or working hand-in-hand with  others about food security you're
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2151839,2157599,talking about gender equality and so on  there were certain areas that were  mentioned during their respective
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2157599,2162960,speeches but it was all about this idea  of how they do business and that is
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2162960,2169280,business that they do in contrast to  other ways around the world in  particular the case that china does it
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2169280,2174320,dws political correspondent thomas  sparrow here in the studio with me and  alexander phenomenon who's been
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2174320,2179760,reporting from the location of the g7  summit in southern germany thank you so
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2179760,2183519,much to both of you for all of your  insights
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2185119,2191680,we'd like to turn our attention now to  the war in ukraine  and multiple explosions were heard on
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2191680,2199200,the southern outskirts of the capital  kiev those came just hours after russian  missiles struck the city center severely
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2199200,2202800,damaging residential buildings
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2206240,2212000,a missile strikes a kiev apartment block  one of 14 incoming rockets this morning
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2212000,2218320,authorities say  it's been three weeks since the last  attack but if kievites were lulled into
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2218320,2224160,a sense of security they are again alert  to the russian threat
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2227200,2233599,rescuers help a person stuck under the  rubble  a seven-year-old girl is pulled to
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2233599,2239200,safety  alive  kiev mayor vitaly klitschko said the
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2239200,2244320,strike was a warning to ukrainians ahead  of a crucial nato summit being held next
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2244320,2250560,week  a day earlier vladimir putin warned nato  not to pursue what he called
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2250560,2257040,confrontational policies  in a meeting with belarusian leader  alexander lukashenko putin announced
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2257040,2263200,that he would deliver nuclear-capable  missiles to his ally in the coming  months
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2264220,2270560,[Music]  hours before ukrainian fighters lost  control of siviro donetsk
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2270560,2276960,leaving the industrial city in russian  hands after weeks of street battles
QFIp0qX9L8Y,2276960,2283680,ukraine called this retreat a tactical  withdrawal to fight from higher ground  in lissy chansk on the opposite bank of
