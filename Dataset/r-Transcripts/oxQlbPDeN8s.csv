oxQlbPDeN8s,2159,7440,the most important step we'll ever take  in life  is our next one
oxQlbPDeN8s,7440,13599,but a lot of us get our feet stuck in  concrete  we get our feet stuck in concrete  because we're afraid
oxQlbPDeN8s,13599,20240,to make enemies  we're afraid as people's on our mind  all that fear
oxQlbPDeN8s,20240,27760,clouds your brain clouds you're thinking  one thing in life you're gonna always  have haters  embrace them

oxQlbPDeN8s,50000,56000,it's possible for you to live your dream  it's necessary that you associate with  winners
oxQlbPDeN8s,56000,61359,that you work your system that you are  relentless that you never give up
oxQlbPDeN8s,61359,67280,it's you you've got to take personal  responsibility you've got to make it  your personal business
oxQlbPDeN8s,67280,73119,to make it happen  and you've got to resolve within  yourself  that i can do this
oxQlbPDeN8s,73119,79759,that it's hard but you've got to say  i'm the one  but you know it's going to be hard
oxQlbPDeN8s,79759,86118,but find out what will make it worth it  for you
oxQlbPDeN8s,93119,101200,fear  fear  is normal  every person feels fear at some point
oxQlbPDeN8s,101200,106640,what should you do  step  [Music]  step take the step
oxQlbPDeN8s,106640,113399,step aggressively toward your fear that  is the step into bravery
oxQlbPDeN8s,114000,121280,are scared of what we don't know  and there is but one way to confront  that fear step
oxQlbPDeN8s,121280,128399,go  and that simple action this simple  attitude answers so many questions how
oxQlbPDeN8s,128399,135360,do you get to the gym every day step  go  how do you change your diet step
oxQlbPDeN8s,135360,141760,go  how do you overcome fear of failure or  fear of success or fear of fear itself
oxQlbPDeN8s,141760,148319,step  go  how do you face the fear of the unknown  step
oxQlbPDeN8s,148319,153599,go  [Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,153599,159280,we're built to walk uphill  and  when you  reach the pinnacle of the hill you want
oxQlbPDeN8s,159280,165120,to stop and appreciate the vision but  the next thing you want is a higher hill  in the distance because
oxQlbPDeN8s,165120,171740,it's the uphill climb that it's it's  from the uphill climb that we derive our  value
oxQlbPDeN8s,171740,178480,[Music]  you want a goal that you can never  attain  right so you can always move closer to
oxQlbPDeN8s,178480,186400,the goal that recedes as you move  towards it  don't wait anymore don't think anymore
oxQlbPDeN8s,186400,191440,don't plan anymore don't contemplate  anymore don't make any more excuses or
oxQlbPDeN8s,191440,199599,justifications don't rationalize  anything else no no no no
oxQlbPDeN8s,199599,208200,instead  be aggressive  take action now
oxQlbPDeN8s,221040,227440,spend your whole life imagining ghosts  worrying about the pathway to the future  but all there will ever be
oxQlbPDeN8s,227440,235120,is what's happening here  and the decisions we make in this moment  which are based in either love or fear
oxQlbPDeN8s,235120,241280,so many of us choose our path out of  fear disguised as practicality  [Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,241280,249040,what we really want seems impossibly out  of reach and ridiculous to expect so we  never dare to ask the universe for it
oxQlbPDeN8s,251439,256959,there are many ways to get the things  that we want for ourselves in our lives  but
oxQlbPDeN8s,256959,264080,basically  it all begins with how we choose to  think  as you think
oxQlbPDeN8s,264080,270320,so shall you be  seven little words that i think are  perhaps the most important things that
oxQlbPDeN8s,270320,277840,we can learn and master in our lives  [Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,277840,284160,because as you pursue that goal  you put yourself together and your life  does get better and richer and more
oxQlbPDeN8s,284160,290000,abundant that's why the highest levels  of virtue and goal are in some sense  transcendent
oxQlbPDeN8s,290000,295759,you want them to be above everything  you're doing so you can continually move  towards something that's more sublime
oxQlbPDeN8s,295759,302639,and better that's what you are you're  here to live not to  not to sleep
oxQlbPDeN8s,304880,311600,excuses sound best  to the person that's making them up
oxQlbPDeN8s,311600,317680,because you grew up in a household with  dysfunction drama  mental spiritual
oxQlbPDeN8s,317680,324800,physical and emotional abuse  doesn't mean that that's the outcome of
oxQlbPDeN8s,324800,331039,what your life your career is destined  to be  and what i know for sure is that the
oxQlbPDeN8s,331039,339840,biggest choices begin and end with you  your internal big questions
oxQlbPDeN8s,339919,346800,who do i want to be in the world  my relationship to source energy
oxQlbPDeN8s,346800,351919,to all that is god i'm not talking about  what you believe in god i'm talking
oxQlbPDeN8s,351919,359280,about your experience of that which is  all life  which is divine and universal i'm
oxQlbPDeN8s,359280,364880,talking about the big deal  being connected and aligned with that
oxQlbPDeN8s,364880,370319,when you are  tuned in and charged into that whenever
oxQlbPDeN8s,370319,376160,you feel empty you go inside yourself  and you connect to the source and you
oxQlbPDeN8s,376160,381800,know that all things are possible
oxQlbPDeN8s,387759,392560,have a mind that is open to everything
oxQlbPDeN8s,392800,400000,and attached to nothing  one of the central principles of my life  is that no one knows enough
oxQlbPDeN8s,400000,407199,to be a pessimist  when we close our mind  to what is possible for us or what is
oxQlbPDeN8s,407199,413039,possible for humanity  closes off  the genius
oxQlbPDeN8s,413039,418479,that resides and lives in each and every  one of us
oxQlbPDeN8s,420560,425840,every man has two lives and the second  starts when he realizes he has just one
oxQlbPDeN8s,425840,432240,it's like a happy person  wants ten thousand things a sick person  just wants one thing it's your unlimited
oxQlbPDeN8s,432240,439280,desires that are clouding your peace  your happiness every desire you have is  an access where you will suffer so just
oxQlbPDeN8s,439280,444880,don't focus on more than one desire at a  time the universe is rigged in such a  way that if you just want one thing and
oxQlbPDeN8s,444880,450240,you focus on that you'll get it but  everything else you gotta let go
oxQlbPDeN8s,450240,456080,life and ambition and the need to know  what we're doing and to always have a
oxQlbPDeN8s,456080,461680,clear delineated path and to always be  100 certain on what we're doing and why
oxQlbPDeN8s,461680,468000,we're doing it not true and that's not  necessary at all  what's important is that you're present
oxQlbPDeN8s,468000,474319,with what you've got right now what  you're doing right now and you do it for  the sake of doing it in this moment and
oxQlbPDeN8s,474319,481120,you don't think about the future  because there is no future and you don't  know how things are going to unfold
oxQlbPDeN8s,481120,487520,ladies and gentlemen go into action with  your dream  and don't avoid where the fights are get
oxQlbPDeN8s,487520,494800,in the midst of the fight get knocked  down so you can learn how to fight so  you can hold your position
oxQlbPDeN8s,494800,500879,see most people don't get out in the  arena of life because they don't want to  fight
oxQlbPDeN8s,501680,507440,most people don't get out there because  they don't want to get knocked down they  don't want to be dropped to their knees  but see you're going to be dropped
oxQlbPDeN8s,507440,513160,whether you're on the field or whether  or not you're sitting on the sidelines
oxQlbPDeN8s,517419,523039,[Music]  what you are looking for what you need
oxQlbPDeN8s,523039,528160,is self-discipline  self-discipline
oxQlbPDeN8s,528160,534560,as the very name implies comes from the  self  you
oxQlbPDeN8s,534560,541120,it comes when you make a decision to be  disciplined  [Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,541120,547200,when you make a decision to be better  when you make a decision to do more and
oxQlbPDeN8s,547200,552240,be more  it's like discipline yourself in one
oxQlbPDeN8s,552240,558560,dimension  see what happens  well that's exciting
oxQlbPDeN8s,560560,568560,the best we have might not always work  but it's still the best we have
oxQlbPDeN8s,568640,574160,and the fact that it might not work  doesn't mean we should throw it away
oxQlbPDeN8s,574800,580320,it's still the best we have  i mean everyone dies and so we fail in  some sense
oxQlbPDeN8s,580320,589720,[Music]  the fact that a symphony ends doesn't  mean that it wasn't worth listening to
oxQlbPDeN8s,594800,600399,no one's coming back to help me  so it starts with that person in that  marriage
oxQlbPDeN8s,600399,607279,you have to realize you are on your own  now on earth is a very lonely journey
oxQlbPDeN8s,607279,613120,it starts with the accountability mirror  looking at saying hey my dad who beat  the hell he's not coming back all these
oxQlbPDeN8s,613120,618880,things are coming back i have to face  myself  and you have to own all those things
oxQlbPDeN8s,618880,626000,that people may have done to you now  it's yours  you got to own it it's yours now to fix  the problems that people did to you
oxQlbPDeN8s,626000,633600,it makes no sense it's not fair  i get it but if you live in that what  was me mentality of guess what
oxQlbPDeN8s,633600,643240,my dad did this to me my mom just did to  me people who bullied did this to me  you're gonna always live right there
oxQlbPDeN8s,647120,652640,motivation is very unrounded right it's  very it's all up here whoa i feel good  when it comes to
oxQlbPDeN8s,652640,657839,time to  bring it into practice  you cannot rely on it
oxQlbPDeN8s,657839,664640,motivation is just a feeling  grounded action  is what gets things done
oxQlbPDeN8s,664640,671200,when you have built a habit it's  ingrained in your nervous system in such  a way that the brain doesn't even have
oxQlbPDeN8s,671200,678160,to consider whether or not it'll get  done it just gets done  commit once you don't need to commit
oxQlbPDeN8s,678160,685839,more than once you commit once to the  thing that you're going to do  and then you do it every single day it's
oxQlbPDeN8s,685839,692690,not the grand visions it's the tiny  actions that move towards a worthy ideal
oxQlbPDeN8s,692690,697009,[Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,699970,706880,[Music]  what makes it hard is your lack of  belief that it can happen for you
oxQlbPDeN8s,706880,714240,the fact of it is though it's very  doable  [Music]  see if but you got to change though if
oxQlbPDeN8s,714240,719440,you keep doing what you've been doing  you're gonna keep getting what you've
oxQlbPDeN8s,719440,724720,been getting  [Music]  nobody's journey is seamless or smooth
oxQlbPDeN8s,724720,730320,we all stumble we all have setbacks if  things go wrong you hit a dead end as
oxQlbPDeN8s,730320,738079,you will  it's just life's way of saying  time to change course
oxQlbPDeN8s,738560,743920,every failure every crisis every  difficult time i say what is this here
oxQlbPDeN8s,743920,750399,to teach me  and what i found is that difficulties  come when you don't pay attention to
oxQlbPDeN8s,750399,756720,life's whisper  because life always whispers to you  first first
oxQlbPDeN8s,756800,762480,and if you ignore the whisper sooner or  later you'll get a scream  whatever you resist persists but if you
oxQlbPDeN8s,762480,769120,ask the right question not why is this  happening but what is this here to teach  me
oxQlbPDeN8s,769760,776480,what is this here to teach me  [Music]  it puts you in the place and space to
oxQlbPDeN8s,776480,783760,get the lesson you need  [Music]  so if you had a place in your life and
oxQlbPDeN8s,783760,789210,you ain't happy with it  you have to change some things
oxQlbPDeN8s,789210,795360,[Music]  there is nothing ever good enough the
oxQlbPDeN8s,795360,801120,only thing that's enough is at the end  of the day the end our final hour
oxQlbPDeN8s,801120,807839,your hand is raised victoriously that's  when you know it's enough  [Music]
oxQlbPDeN8s,807839,813120,it will never go your way guys  if you're saying today is good enough
oxQlbPDeN8s,813120,821120,if you never  say good enough today i promise you  tomorrow will always be enough
oxQlbPDeN8s,821120,828560,whenever good enough isn't enough  you can bet tomorrow  you'll have enough
oxQlbPDeN8s,828560,834560,the way it is for you is blood sweat and  tears today  to create a foundation to strengthen
oxQlbPDeN8s,834560,837040,tomorrow
oxQlbPDeN8s,841600,847920,those days combined  into whatever dream you want to be a  reality
oxQlbPDeN8s,851199,856399,it's not the critical counts  not the man who points out how the
oxQlbPDeN8s,856399,862639,strong man stumbles  or where the door of these could have  done them better  the credit belongs to the man who is
oxQlbPDeN8s,862639,868480,actually in the arena  whose face is marred by dust and sweat  and blood who strives valiantly who
oxQlbPDeN8s,868480,873519,errors who comes up short and short  time and time again because there's no
oxQlbPDeN8s,873519,879440,effort without error and shortcoming  but who does actually strive to duty
oxQlbPDeN8s,879440,885360,who knows great enthusiasm  great devotion  who spends himself in a worthy cause who
oxQlbPDeN8s,885360,890800,has the best nose and the end the  triumph of high achievement
oxQlbPDeN8s,890800,897839,who at the worst if he fails at least he  fails while daring to be great  so that his place should never be with
oxQlbPDeN8s,897839,904000,the cold and timid souls who neither  know victory  nor defeat
oxQlbPDeN8s,904000,910639,there's so many times in life you don't  want to be doing what you're doing  you can't just quit
oxQlbPDeN8s,910639,916959,remember this this isn't a hobby it's in  a joke it's a lifestyle
oxQlbPDeN8s,920720,927360,engage  [Music]  engage
oxQlbPDeN8s,927360,934480,weakness is strong i must be stronger  i must crush it into submission through
oxQlbPDeN8s,934480,941279,force of will  so i savage the body i push and pull and
oxQlbPDeN8s,941279,948320,fight against gravity  i fight against fatigue and soreness and  the weakness that says give in
oxQlbPDeN8s,948320,953360,i will not give in  i will fight
oxQlbPDeN8s,953360,959440,you got to rise up you got to make your  dreams a reality and live a damn  masterpiece you know this make a
oxQlbPDeN8s,959440,964560,decision  what's the decision  what's the thing you came here for now
oxQlbPDeN8s,964560,972000,we're at the moment the clock is ticking  life can be long  you bury your dreams you quit this
oxQlbPDeN8s,972000,977519,life gets long  it's only a thought if you don't take an  action
oxQlbPDeN8s,977519,983120,the difference between a thought and a  decision there's an action so we know  and you know you just decided and you
oxQlbPDeN8s,983120,990560,know what it is you know what it is  a decision you've made something you do
oxQlbPDeN8s,990560,995800,that you follow up with the action to  make it real
oxQlbPDeN8s,1009310,1016399,[Music]  what we don't do is we don't go  inside  so literally turn yourself inside out
oxQlbPDeN8s,1016399,1021680,read the book that says like we're  writing a book every day of our lives  but we never read that book
oxQlbPDeN8s,1021680,1026880,so what i would challenge this young man  or young woman to do  is you have to look inside of yourself
oxQlbPDeN8s,1026880,1033360,and see what you really want what are  you passionate about  so when i speak i speak from passion i
oxQlbPDeN8s,1033360,1040880,speak from experience i i speak from  suffering  that the only way i believe this is my
oxQlbPDeN8s,1040880,1047360,experience in life  the only way you're ever going to get to  the other side of this journey
oxQlbPDeN8s,1047360,1054159,is you have got to suffer to grow  to grow you must suffer
oxQlbPDeN8s,1055280,1062960,commitment  is staying true to what you said you  would do long after the move that you've  said it in his left
oxQlbPDeN8s,1064080,1069120,commitment is staying true to what you  said  you would do long after the move
oxQlbPDeN8s,1069120,1076960,that you set it in as left  like i know when the mood is right we  hike we we we talking we high-fiving we
oxQlbPDeN8s,1076960,1082799,talking about what we gonna do and then  we get in that certain moment of  adversity that certain moment of truth  and it tests our character and the thing
oxQlbPDeN8s,1082799,1088400,i love about adversity adversity  introduce you into who you really are as  a person
oxQlbPDeN8s,1088799,1095200,but you can only do that through the  struggle of life and most people avoid  the struggle most people go through life
oxQlbPDeN8s,1095200,1101520,avoiding pain  and when you go through life like that  something in you dies
oxQlbPDeN8s,1101520,1108080,something in you  that you never activate is lying dormant  in there that you never get a chance to
oxQlbPDeN8s,1108080,1113919,call on because you have not challenged  yourself  somebody said the land of familiarity
oxQlbPDeN8s,1113919,1122080,belongs to  the dead  but sometimes in day-to-day life you can
oxQlbPDeN8s,1122080,1128799,lose track of the long-term goal  it fades from your vision it slips from
oxQlbPDeN8s,1128799,1134960,your mind  wrong  i want that long-term goal to be so
oxQlbPDeN8s,1134960,1142880,embedded in my mind that i never lose  sight of it  ever  and the little tasks and projects and
oxQlbPDeN8s,1142880,1148240,short-term goals that you tackle need to  lead towards strategic victory winning
oxQlbPDeN8s,1148240,1153679,the long war  [Music]  when you get tired when you get fatigued
oxQlbPDeN8s,1153679,1160080,when you get down when you're in a slump  it's your habits rituals routines and  your standards that carry you through if
oxQlbPDeN8s,1160080,1166480,you don't have good habits you don't  have good rituals you don't have good  routines always in your life you will  fall down in bad times and slumps and
oxQlbPDeN8s,1166480,1172559,fatigue and stress  i'm telling you that look you can't  activate life you can't begin to
oxQlbPDeN8s,1172559,1179120,experience life in the way you want to  experience you can't have it you can't  be it you can't do it until you activate
oxQlbPDeN8s,1179120,1185760,it until yes it's all in there all your  gifts all your talents all your  everything you need to do to be what
oxQlbPDeN8s,1185760,1192160,you've been called to do what you've  been birthed to do you can't do until  you activate until you recognize you
oxQlbPDeN8s,1192160,1200320,matter everything about you is great but  the problem is you have consciously  chosen to be average
oxQlbPDeN8s,1200559,1206640,so what you say to yourself is important  there's no coach there's no trainer to  keep you going it's only you
oxQlbPDeN8s,1206640,1212400,the whole thing is this  don't say a word  stay uncommon amongst uncommon people
oxQlbPDeN8s,1212400,1220000,you're never done  don't stop when you're tired  stop when you're done stay hard
oxQlbPDeN8s,1220000,1225360,you begin to discover who you are then  you really realize  how you have been given authority and
oxQlbPDeN8s,1225360,1232720,dominion  over everything on the face of the earth
oxQlbPDeN8s,1233520,1237679,including all the dimensions of your  life
oxQlbPDeN8s,1245360,1250720,in other words when the outcome changes  and it's not what we want it to be and  it doesn't turn out the way we want it

oxQlbPDeN8s,1770799,1777200,think the reason why we even have the  question  of where do i begin is from fear  we're paralyzed
