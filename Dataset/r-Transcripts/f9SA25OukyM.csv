f9SA25OukyM,7360,11430,"which is saying that sucked, and so we go right back to it."

f9SA25OukyM,22687,27217,"@erikadestiny asks, ""Why does eye contact"
f9SA25OukyM,27217,29419,"""intimidate the [beeps] out of me?"""
f9SA25OukyM,29420,32360,"Well, the fact is that it's not just you."
f9SA25OukyM,32360,36290,A lot of us are intimidated by eye contact.
f9SA25OukyM,36290,40370,"In fact, all primates avoid making"
f9SA25OukyM,40370,42809,too much eye contact with each other.
f9SA25OukyM,42810,44990,Apes will look at the alpha.
f9SA25OukyM,44990,48460,He has the ability to look over everybody.
f9SA25OukyM,48460,51390,But everybody else tries to avoid
f9SA25OukyM,51390,54270,making too much of a direct eye contact.
f9SA25OukyM,54270,57600,And we humans are much the same.
f9SA25OukyM,57600,60039,"When the eye contact is too direct,"
f9SA25OukyM,60040,62470,"too intense, it is intimidating."
f9SA25OukyM,62470,65510,And this is something that obviously poker players
f9SA25OukyM,65510,69230,have used for decades to intimidate each other.
f9SA25OukyM,69230,73900,It really creates a subconscious instability
f9SA25OukyM,73900,77440,that often drives them to change their behavior.
f9SA25OukyM,77440,79240,Because they're not aware that
f9SA25OukyM,79240,83110,they're being intimidated at a subconscious level.
f9SA25OukyM,83110,85820,Here's a question from @ilikeslicedpear.
f9SA25OukyM,86757,89807,"""Can eye contact and long silence gazes"
f9SA25OukyM,89807,92663,"""be love language cause shidddd?"""
f9SA25OukyM,94480,97090,"When it comes to courtship, when it comes to dating,"
f9SA25OukyM,97090,101049,most of the decisions that we make is non-verbally.
f9SA25OukyM,101050,103930,And eye gaze behavior is very powerful
f9SA25OukyM,103930,107370,when we are in the presence of someone we enjoy.
f9SA25OukyM,107370,109330,It can certainly be indicative
f9SA25OukyM,109330,113200,of I liked this person very much.
f9SA25OukyM,113200,116469,And I would certainly pay close attention to it.
f9SA25OukyM,116470,118280,"So, onto the next question."
f9SA25OukyM,118280,123280,"It comes to us from a friend of mine, @ericgoulard."

f9SA25OukyM,127777,131039,"""interview, or on important points?"""
f9SA25OukyM,131039,131950,That's a great question.
f9SA25OukyM,131950,134520,And it often manifests in different ways.
f9SA25OukyM,134520,136630,"Sometimes people take the glasses off,"
f9SA25OukyM,136630,139460,and they rub the bridge of the nose.
f9SA25OukyM,139460,142250,Or they may massage the back
f9SA25OukyM,142250,144760,"of the ear, where the glasses rest."
f9SA25OukyM,144760,148500,And that is to accommodate themselves.
f9SA25OukyM,148500,153210,They may also take their glasses off to pacify.
f9SA25OukyM,153210,154820,You'll often see people put them
f9SA25OukyM,154820,157360,in their mouths as they're thinking.
f9SA25OukyM,157360,159710,This is no different than a pacifier.
f9SA25OukyM,159710,163120,Other people use it almost like a baton
f9SA25OukyM,163120,166610,to demark a point as they're talking.
f9SA25OukyM,166610,169910,While others are using it basically
f9SA25OukyM,169910,174910,to create novelty to get other people's attention.
f9SA25OukyM,174957,179640,"@esrahamood asks, ""How do I improve my poker face?"""
f9SA25OukyM,179640,182090,The easiest way to improve your poker face
f9SA25OukyM,182090,185500,is something that I taught Phil Hellmuth a long time ago.
f9SA25OukyM,185500,186920,"Just keep in mind, you can improve"
f9SA25OukyM,186920,189340,"your poker face, but not your poker body."
f9SA25OukyM,189340,192120,"So, sometimes we'll reveal things somewhere in our body."
f9SA25OukyM,192120,194250,"But put your elbows on the table,"
f9SA25OukyM,194250,195810,bring your thumbs together.
f9SA25OukyM,195810,200810,And you perch your chin on the thumbs.
f9SA25OukyM,201230,203830,and then you interlace the fingers.
f9SA25OukyM,203830,205760,And they block your mouth.
f9SA25OukyM,205760,208599,"You look straight ahead, but slightly down."
f9SA25OukyM,208600,212180,And what happens is you virtually disappear.
f9SA25OukyM,212180,215180,Because there's nothing there for anyone to see.
f9SA25OukyM,215180,218799,"So, after a while people will avoid looking at you"
f9SA25OukyM,218800,222367,"because there's nothing new there, there's no novelty."

f9SA25OukyM,235307,238000,"""that you saw them appear irritated?"""
f9SA25OukyM,238000,242260,A lot of times we display discomfort through our eyes.
f9SA25OukyM,242260,245150,"We'll squint, we may look away."
f9SA25OukyM,245150,249700,We may cover the eyes when something is bothering us.
f9SA25OukyM,249700,252739,And the easiest way to make other people
f9SA25OukyM,252740,255520,more comfortable without saying anything
f9SA25OukyM,255520,259959,is to move slightly away and angle yourself.
f9SA25OukyM,259959,263940,Humans tend to approach each other directly.
f9SA25OukyM,263940,265920,What we don't realize is that this
f9SA25OukyM,265920,268340,actually minimizes face time.
f9SA25OukyM,268340,272400,The closer we get the more intense the look.
f9SA25OukyM,272400,275130,This can act as an irritant.
f9SA25OukyM,275130,278070,One of the best things that we can do anytime
f9SA25OukyM,278070,282740,"is when we approach each other, and we sense"
f9SA25OukyM,282740,284910,that there's some sort of irritation
f9SA25OukyM,284910,289910,"or a psychological discomfort, is always to move back."
f9SA25OukyM,290660,294470,And then always angle yourself so that you're looking
f9SA25OukyM,294470,299080,at each other at angles rather than directly.
f9SA25OukyM,299080,301960,"This, whether you're in business"
f9SA25OukyM,301960,304910,"or in interpersonal relationships,"
f9SA25OukyM,304910,308580,"this actually minimizes face time,"
f9SA25OukyM,308580,313530,where by angling this increases face time.
f9SA25OukyM,313530,317233,Because it contributes to psychological comfort.

f9SA25OukyM,322207,327207,"""to experience delight, or is it like narcissistic smirk?"""
f9SA25OukyM,327740,332740,"So, in 1986, Paul Lachman coined the term, duping delight."
f9SA25OukyM,333180,335020,"And basically, what that looks like"
f9SA25OukyM,335020,337259,is you have this little smirk on your face
f9SA25OukyM,337260,339210,like you're getting away with something.
f9SA25OukyM,339210,342310,I would say it's like showing off.
f9SA25OukyM,342310,345750,You can take great pleasure in getting away with something.
f9SA25OukyM,345750,350010,But when you exercise duping delight it's sort of
f9SA25OukyM,350010,353260,"like telling the world, yeah, I got away with it."
f9SA25OukyM,353260,357350,Here we have a question from @Artemismoongodd.
f9SA25OukyM,357350,360297,"And he asks, ""are there body language"

f9SA25OukyM,367610,371250,"Yes, in other cultures they say hello differently."
f9SA25OukyM,371250,375670,We tend to wave our hands high and above.
f9SA25OukyM,375670,378940,"And other cultures, they may do it more subtly."
f9SA25OukyM,378940,382130,"We tend to say, oh, everything's okay."
f9SA25OukyM,382130,383880,And yet in other cultures
f9SA25OukyM,383880,385840,that's considered a phallic symbol.
f9SA25OukyM,385840,388180,So they don't do the okay sign.
f9SA25OukyM,388180,390900,We like to shake hands.
f9SA25OukyM,390900,393660,And we do so all over the United States.
f9SA25OukyM,393660,397190,"But interestingly enough, we have cultures within cultures."
f9SA25OukyM,397190,401730,"So in New York you may have more of a strong grip,"
f9SA25OukyM,401730,404040,where in the Midwest it might be
f9SA25OukyM,404040,408910,just a quick touch of the hands and movement away.
f9SA25OukyM,408910,412700,It's always good to consider the culture that you're in.
f9SA25OukyM,412700,415900,Because when we mirror these behaviors
f9SA25OukyM,415900,418280,it lets others know that we respect them
f9SA25OukyM,418280,420900,and that we are in synchrony with them.
f9SA25OukyM,420900,424830,"And of course, as I've always said, synchrony is harmony."
f9SA25OukyM,424830,428240,Here's a great question from @to_believe_yes.
f9SA25OukyM,428240,430300,Can body language be submitted
f9SA25OukyM,430300,432930,as admissible evidence in court?
f9SA25OukyM,432930,437930,"Absolutely, in the famous 1967 case of Terry v. Ohio"
f9SA25OukyM,438500,441480,the Supreme court considered this.
f9SA25OukyM,441480,445810,And they said if a police officer can articulate
f9SA25OukyM,445810,448940,with particularity the body language
f9SA25OukyM,448940,453770,that he or she observed it can absolutely be used
f9SA25OukyM,453770,458120,in court to justify the actions of a police officer.
f9SA25OukyM,458120,462507,"To answer your question again, absolutely, yes."
f9SA25OukyM,462507,467120,@johnrobison asks a very important question.
f9SA25OukyM,467120,468510,And it's directed at me.
f9SA25OukyM,468510,471770,Most of your FBI profiling career Joe
f9SA25OukyM,471770,476330,was before today's more widespread autism awareness.
f9SA25OukyM,476330,481099,"But did you interview known autistics, were they different?"
f9SA25OukyM,481100,486100,My approach was always to deal with the person
f9SA25OukyM,486110,488889,"that was in front of me, however they manifest."
f9SA25OukyM,488890,492680,There were some people who were on the autism spectrum.
f9SA25OukyM,492680,495449,And as an interviewer it's not my job
f9SA25OukyM,495450,499970,to figure their behaviors out other than to note them
f9SA25OukyM,499970,502550,"and say, how do I get around this?"
f9SA25OukyM,502550,505990,You deal with each human as they present.
f9SA25OukyM,505990,510740,And you try to work with them to establish communications.
f9SA25OukyM,510740,512490,"And if that means stepping back,"
f9SA25OukyM,512490,514770,"if that means handing them a piece of paper,"
f9SA25OukyM,514770,519328,"if that means not making eye contact, then so be it."

f9SA25OukyM,533480,535949,You look at your watch two or three times.
f9SA25OukyM,535950,539720,"But let's face it, with some nothing may ever work."
f9SA25OukyM,539720,541189,The first one I like to do
f9SA25OukyM,541190,544010,is I orient my foot towards an exit.
f9SA25OukyM,544010,546090,A lot of people catch that
f9SA25OukyM,546090,549280,and sense that I'm moving away slightly.
f9SA25OukyM,549280,551530,There's other times when no amount
f9SA25OukyM,551530,554540,of body language gets through to these people.
f9SA25OukyM,554540,557850,"So what I do is I put my hand on their arm and I say,"
f9SA25OukyM,557850,560600,"buddy, I'd love to stay, but I gotta run."
f9SA25OukyM,560600,563339,"Take care, must go, so long."
