u6DYuipcwiE,1040,2800,if you were forced to play a game of
u6DYuipcwiE,2800,4799,werewolf in real life where you have to
u6DYuipcwiE,4799,7359,murder the other players or else you die
u6DYuipcwiE,7359,9679,what would you do i'm going to break
u6DYuipcwiE,9679,11920,down mistakes made what you should do
u6DYuipcwiE,11920,13679,and how to beat the high school death
u6DYuipcwiE,13679,16240,game in werewolf game villager side all
u6DYuipcwiE,16240,17680,of these students will have to murder
u6DYuipcwiE,17680,20080,each other just to survive iot here
u6DYuipcwiE,20080,21920,wakes up next to her friend naoko in a
u6DYuipcwiE,21920,24000,dark room with no idea where they are or
u6DYuipcwiE,24000,25599,how they got here they both checked
u6DYuipcwiE,25599,27519,their phones but quickly realized that
u6DYuipcwiE,27519,29439,neither of them can get a signal as the
u6DYuipcwiE,29439,31279,other students wake up this pretty boy
u6DYuipcwiE,31279,33120,takeshi walks through the door to try
u6DYuipcwiE,33120,34719,and find out where the hell they are and
u6DYuipcwiE,34719,36640,the others follow him into a huge room
u6DYuipcwiE,36640,38239,where they find a circle of chairs
u6DYuipcwiE,38239,40320,arranged in front of a television set
u6DYuipcwiE,40320,42480,this boy inserts a tape into the vcr and
u6DYuipcwiE,42480,45039,the tv suddenly turns itself on display
u6DYuipcwiE,45039,46800,on the screen is a message telling them
u6DYuipcwiE,46800,48000,they're forbidden from leaving the
u6DYuipcwiE,48000,50320,building and must now play a werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,50320,52239,game this kid warns the others not to
u6DYuipcwiE,52239,53680,step through the doorway and they all
u6DYuipcwiE,53680,55520,gather to read the message as the tv
u6DYuipcwiE,55520,57199,tells them that these 10 students will
u6DYuipcwiE,57199,59520,be split into two teams eight of them
u6DYuipcwiE,59520,61440,will be villagers and their goal is to
u6DYuipcwiE,61440,63359,find and kill the werewolves during the
u6DYuipcwiE,63359,64878,day while two students will be
u6DYuipcwiE,64878,67200,werewolves and their goal is to kill one
u6DYuipcwiE,67200,69439,villager each night every student has
u6DYuipcwiE,69439,70960,been given a card to tell them which
u6DYuipcwiE,70960,72479,team they're on and with that the
u6DYuipcwiE,72479,74640,television goes blank the students are
u6DYuipcwiE,74640,76560,confused and think it's just a stupid
u6DYuipcwiE,76560,78240,prank but then they're told that they've
u6DYuipcwiE,78240,80320,been given a bottle of potassium cyanide
u6DYuipcwiE,80320,82000,poison to help them kill each other
u6DYuipcwiE,82000,83840,realizing this is not a joke each
u6DYuipcwiE,83840,85280,student begins to check their pockets
u6DYuipcwiE,85280,86960,for their roll cards and this girl
u6DYuipcwiE,86960,88720,discovers that she's been given the role
u6DYuipcwiE,88720,90720,of a villager every night she might get
u6DYuipcwiE,90720,92560,killed by a werewolf but her friend
u6DYuipcwiE,92560,94640,finds this ridiculous she refuses to
u6DYuipcwiE,94640,96240,play this game and opens the door to
u6DYuipcwiE,96240,98400,leave the building but that was her last
u6DYuipcwiE,98400,100880,mistake suddenly blood sprays out of her
u6DYuipcwiE,100880,102399,neck and the other students are
u6DYuipcwiE,102399,104320,completely shocked they can't believe
u6DYuipcwiE,104320,106079,that this death game is really happening
u6DYuipcwiE,106079,107920,and this is only the beginning of an
u6DYuipcwiE,107920,109680,absolute bloodbath
u6DYuipcwiE,109680,111600,okay this death game just turned this
u6DYuipcwiE,111600,113840,girl into a jackson pollock painting and
u6DYuipcwiE,113840,116000,all she did was take one step out the
u6DYuipcwiE,116000,118079,door that means if we break any rules
u6DYuipcwiE,118079,119920,it's instant death for us which is a
u6DYuipcwiE,119920,122079,horrifying realization now instead of
u6DYuipcwiE,122079,123759,being frozen in terror like all these
u6DYuipcwiE,123759,125600,students we need to use that fear as a
u6DYuipcwiE,125600,127600,motivator to survive whoever starts
u6DYuipcwiE,127600,129200,strategizing is going to have a much
u6DYuipcwiE,129200,130720,better chance at winning and from what
u6DYuipcwiE,130720,132640,we know so far it all comes down to a
u6DYuipcwiE,132640,135040,role card you have now the rules forbid
u6DYuipcwiE,135040,136800,us from looking at other people's cards
u6DYuipcwiE,136800,138640,but we might be able to find clues about
u6DYuipcwiE,138640,140319,who the werewolves are by gauging
u6DYuipcwiE,140319,142400,everyone's emotional responses the
u6DYuipcwiE,142400,143760,villagers have to worry about getting
u6DYuipcwiE,143760,145599,murdered each night by the werewolves so
u6DYuipcwiE,145599,147040,it makes sense for them to look more
u6DYuipcwiE,147040,148879,worried when they see their card but
u6DYuipcwiE,148879,150560,since the wolves are the ones doing the
u6DYuipcwiE,150560,152400,killing then they might have a different
u6DYuipcwiE,152400,154080,reaction like they're trying to hide
u6DYuipcwiE,154080,156000,something we need to look for any signs
u6DYuipcwiE,156000,157840,of suspicious behavior and that brings
u6DYuipcwiE,157840,160080,me to this girl right here earlier
u6DYuipcwiE,160080,162080,everyone woke up in the same room but
u6DYuipcwiE,162080,163680,while they were reading the rules this
u6DYuipcwiE,163680,165599,girl came in from a separate door five
u6DYuipcwiE,165599,167599,minutes late she didn't ask any
u6DYuipcwiE,167599,169599,questions or even look surprised to find
u6DYuipcwiE,169599,171360,other people here which is not normal
u6DYuipcwiE,171360,173360,behavior given the situation i think
u6DYuipcwiE,173360,174720,it's pretty clear she might know more
u6DYuipcwiE,174720,176319,than anyone else and i would be
u6DYuipcwiE,176319,177920,following her for the rest of the day to
u6DYuipcwiE,177920,179840,study her behavior because i think it
u6DYuipcwiE,179840,181840,will tell us something useful this is
u6DYuipcwiE,181840,183360,exactly why the first person to
u6DYuipcwiE,183360,185760,understand is a competition for survival
u6DYuipcwiE,185760,187440,is going to come out on top because
u6DYuipcwiE,187440,189200,you'll be quicker to notice details just
u6DYuipcwiE,189200,191360,like this one now as far as the other
u6DYuipcwiE,191360,193120,players we can actually find out a lot
u6DYuipcwiE,193120,194720,about their personalities just by
u6DYuipcwiE,194720,196480,observing their positions in the room
u6DYuipcwiE,196480,198319,the students who stay furthest away are
u6DYuipcwiE,198319,200239,most likely to be introverted and shy
u6DYuipcwiE,200239,202239,away from conflict or decision making in
u6DYuipcwiE,202239,203920,the front the person who's reading the
u6DYuipcwiE,203920,205840,rules out loud is a natural born leader
u6DYuipcwiE,205840,207840,and wants to understand the situation
u6DYuipcwiE,207840,209599,this is really useful information
u6DYuipcwiE,209599,210799,because they haven't looked at their
u6DYuipcwiE,210799,212560,cards yet so we know that they're being
u6DYuipcwiE,212560,214080,true to their personalities in this
u6DYuipcwiE,214080,215920,moment the werewolves will have to be
u6DYuipcwiE,215920,217680,very manipulative in this game and
u6DYuipcwiE,217680,219120,constantly lie in order to evade
u6DYuipcwiE,219120,220720,suspicion from the group but if you
u6DYuipcwiE,220720,222319,realize that one of these shy players
u6DYuipcwiE,222319,224159,starts talking a lot more it's going to
u6DYuipcwiE,224159,225680,help you figure out that they're acting
u6DYuipcwiE,225680,227760,suspiciously we won't be able to notice
u6DYuipcwiE,227760,229680,a change of personality like this unless
u6DYuipcwiE,229680,231519,we have something to base it on so it's
u6DYuipcwiE,231519,233280,absolutely essential that we use this
u6DYuipcwiE,233280,235280,moment here as a reference because it
u6DYuipcwiE,235280,236959,will help us observe any changes in
u6DYuipcwiE,236959,238799,their behavior later in the game and
u6DYuipcwiE,238799,240560,that lets us draw conclusions about what
u6DYuipcwiE,240560,242319,cards they are most likely to have
u6DYuipcwiE,242319,244159,takeshi here comes over to inspect the
u6DYuipcwiE,244159,246159,dead body and notices something on the
u6DYuipcwiE,246159,248560,girl's neck realizing what this means he
u6DYuipcwiE,248560,250239,reaches up the final rod sticking out
u6DYuipcwiE,250239,251920,from underneath his skin the other
u6DYuipcwiE,251920,253360,players touch their own necks to find
u6DYuipcwiE,253360,255200,they all have one and it's implanted
u6DYuipcwiE,255200,257280,deep inside of them they could all die
u6DYuipcwiE,257280,258639,just like the girl if they leave the
u6DYuipcwiE,258639,260239,building and they're trapped here with
u6DYuipcwiE,260239,262639,no one around to help them splitting up
u6DYuipcwiE,262639,264240,some of the students gather at the front
u6DYuipcwiE,264240,266000,entrance to try screaming for help it's
u6DYuipcwiE,266000,267520,a hopeless cause and there's no one
u6DYuipcwiE,267520,269199,around for miles but that's when the
u6DYuipcwiE,269199,271759,nerdy kid has a clever idea walking back
u6DYuipcwiE,271759,273199,into the voting room he tells the
u6DYuipcwiE,273199,275360,villager i read that he has a plan if
u6DYuipcwiE,275360,277120,they throw her friend's body outside the
u6DYuipcwiE,277120,279040,building someone might find it and come
u6DYuipcwiE,279040,281440,to save them but the girl is shocked she
u6DYuipcwiE,281440,283120,can't believe they would suggest such a
u6DYuipcwiE,283120,284720,thing and as the group tries to take her
u6DYuipcwiE,284720,286479,friend out of the room the girl starts
u6DYuipcwiE,286479,288320,to break down she tries to fight them
u6DYuipcwiE,288320,290000,off as they carry the body out but it's
u6DYuipcwiE,290000,291759,their best and only chance of finding
u6DYuipcwiE,291759,293759,help at the front entrance they toss the
u6DYuipcwiE,293759,295440,dead girl through the doorway and leave
u6DYuipcwiE,295440,297280,her there as the villager breaks down in
u6DYuipcwiE,297280,299280,tears but it's time for them to realize
u6DYuipcwiE,299280,301039,that the only way out of here alive is
u6DYuipcwiE,301039,303039,to play the werewolf game and win
u6DYuipcwiE,303039,304880,meanwhile in the kitchen the rest of the
u6DYuipcwiE,304880,306400,players have gathered to strategize
u6DYuipcwiE,306400,308160,about the game tonight they'll all have
u6DYuipcwiE,308160,310080,to decide who they think the werewolf is
u6DYuipcwiE,310080,311840,and fumi here suggests that the four of
u6DYuipcwiE,311840,313440,them should agree on who to kill so
u6DYuipcwiE,313440,315440,they'll be safe in tonight's boat it's a
u6DYuipcwiE,315440,317680,clever strategy but this kitomo hero
u6DYuipcwiE,317680,319360,points out that someone here could be a
u6DYuipcwiE,319360,321759,werewolf fumi here defends his idea
u6DYuipcwiE,321759,323360,saying that at least they'd all survive
u6DYuipcwiE,323360,325280,past the vote and there's no guarantee
u6DYuipcwiE,325280,327199,to discover a werewolf in the first
u6DYuipcwiE,327199,329199,round this girl compliments him on how
u6DYuipcwiE,329199,331440,smart he is and the boy brags that he's
u6DYuipcwiE,331440,333680,actually a werewolf game pro everyone
u6DYuipcwiE,333680,336000,seems impressed but his plan is about to
u6DYuipcwiE,336000,338880,go terribly wrong okay this kid is
u6DYuipcwiE,338880,341520,sneaky as hell and i absolutely love it
u6DYuipcwiE,341520,343199,he's already working the game to his
u6DYuipcwiE,343199,345120,advantage by gathering a small group of
u6DYuipcwiE,345120,347120,players to build a secret strategy he
u6DYuipcwiE,347120,349039,knows that if he can control their votes
u6DYuipcwiE,349039,351039,he's going to stay alive but there's one
u6DYuipcwiE,351039,353120,huge problem with this plan right now
u6DYuipcwiE,353120,354880,fumi here is drawing too much attention
u6DYuipcwiE,354880,357199,to himself and that's really dangerous
u6DYuipcwiE,357199,359280,because it can backfire in a werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,359280,361280,game nobody can be trusted and if people
u6DYuipcwiE,361280,362800,get the impression that you're trying to
u6DYuipcwiE,362800,364560,manipulate them they're going to suspect
u6DYuipcwiE,364560,366880,that you're the werewolf fumi has also
u6DYuipcwiE,366880,368319,admitted that he's an expert at this
u6DYuipcwiE,368319,370720,game and that's a horrible idea because
u6DYuipcwiE,370720,372639,if a werewolf is sitting at this table
u6DYuipcwiE,372639,374560,he's just made himself their primary
u6DYuipcwiE,374560,376800,target an expert player is going to be
u6DYuipcwiE,376800,378639,better at discovering who the werewolves
u6DYuipcwiE,378639,380080,are and there's no way to let him stay
u6DYuipcwiE,380080,382639,alive for very long now having said that
u6DYuipcwiE,382639,384000,it's definitely important to try and
u6DYuipcwiE,384000,385759,gather votes to make sure you survive
u6DYuipcwiE,385759,387440,but we need to be more tactful with our
u6DYuipcwiE,387440,389360,approach the best way to manipulate
u6DYuipcwiE,389360,391520,others without joint suspicion is to do
u6DYuipcwiE,391520,393280,all the logic building for them and let
u6DYuipcwiE,393280,395120,them reach the conclusions on their own
u6DYuipcwiE,395120,396720,if you say just enough to let people
u6DYuipcwiE,396720,398560,think that everything is their idea
u6DYuipcwiE,398560,400319,though when hits the fan it's not
u6DYuipcwiE,400319,402560,going to fall on you now the other group
u6DYuipcwiE,402560,404240,is in denial here and think that
u6DYuipcwiE,404240,406000,escaping is still their best chance at
u6DYuipcwiE,406000,408000,survival i'm all for this because it's
u6DYuipcwiE,408000,409599,important to explore all of her options
u6DYuipcwiE,409599,411280,but throwing a girl's dead body three
u6DYuipcwiE,411280,413120,feet away from the entrance in order to
u6DYuipcwiE,413120,415039,get help is just about the stupidest
u6DYuipcwiE,415039,417360,thing i've ever seen frankly if they
u6DYuipcwiE,417360,419039,insist on using the girl's dead body to
u6DYuipcwiE,419039,420560,get outside help then they should have
u6DYuipcwiE,420560,422240,at least put some wheels on her the
u6DYuipcwiE,422240,424240,better version of this terrible idea
u6DYuipcwiE,424240,425919,would have been to use his tv card here
u6DYuipcwiE,425919,428000,and roll her body further down the road
u6DYuipcwiE,428000,429759,if you look here you can see that the
u6DYuipcwiE,429759,431520,building is on a slope so she'll roll
u6DYuipcwiE,431520,432960,further down where there might be more
u6DYuipcwiE,432960,434880,cars this would be much better than
u6DYuipcwiE,434880,436479,dumping the poor girl three feet from
u6DYuipcwiE,436479,438160,the entrance but it's not even their
u6DYuipcwiE,438160,440319,best option look at how remote this
u6DYuipcwiE,440319,442479,place is we're completely stranded in
u6DYuipcwiE,442479,444080,the middle of the woods so the only
u6DYuipcwiE,444080,445680,signal that anyone will spot for miles
u6DYuipcwiE,445680,448160,away is fire now they don't have a stove
u6DYuipcwiE,448160,449759,or any lighters in this kitchen but that
u6DYuipcwiE,449759,451840,doesn't make this impossible one of the
u6DYuipcwiE,451840,453759,10 players here wears eyeglasses and if
u6DYuipcwiE,453759,455440,we use them to focus the sunlight onto a
u6DYuipcwiE,455440,457280,piece of paper we'll be able to start a
u6DYuipcwiE,457280,459120,fire if there's a way of getting to the
u6DYuipcwiE,459120,460880,roof without leaving the building then
u6DYuipcwiE,460880,462720,it makes the most sense to bring as many
u6DYuipcwiE,462720,464560,flammable items out and wait until night
u6DYuipcwiE,464560,466720,so we can set them ablaze it's obviously
u6DYuipcwiE,466720,468319,a dangerous strategy but since these
u6DYuipcwiE,468319,469840,players here don't believe they need to
u6DYuipcwiE,469840,471680,play the game yet it's their best and
u6DYuipcwiE,471680,473520,only chance at calling for help the
u6DYuipcwiE,473520,474960,group meets up in the classroom where
u6DYuipcwiE,474960,476560,the nerd writes down everyone's names on
u6DYuipcwiE,476560,478479,the chalkboard they're trying to figure
u6DYuipcwiE,478479,479840,out why they've been selected to play in
u6DYuipcwiE,479840,481599,this death game and that's when maori
u6DYuipcwiE,481599,483520,here admits she's the older sister of
u6DYuipcwiE,483520,485919,this girl konami they have the same last
u6DYuipcwiE,485919,487840,name and the group isn't surprised but
u6DYuipcwiE,487840,489919,nobody realized that this admission was
u6DYuipcwiE,489919,492000,a huge disadvantage and could end the
u6DYuipcwiE,492000,493919,game as the others continue to discuss
u6DYuipcwiE,493919,495919,their connections this kid total hero
u6DYuipcwiE,495919,497680,won't stop staring at irene and he
u6DYuipcwiE,497680,499840,decides to introduce himself he asks the
u6DYuipcwiE,499840,501759,girl's name but she's too traumatized to
u6DYuipcwiE,501759,504000,open up finally she tells everyone her
u6DYuipcwiE,504000,505360,name and they figure out that she
u6DYuipcwiE,505360,506720,follows this nerd here on twitter
u6DYuipcwiE,506720,508639,because he's an activist but other than
u6DYuipcwiE,508639,510639,this no one else has any connection to
u6DYuipcwiE,510639,512240,each other they're all strangers trapped
u6DYuipcwiE,512240,514159,in this game and the only way to escape
u6DYuipcwiE,514159,516560,is to kill that night the first voting
u6DYuipcwiE,516560,519039,session begins this girl hitomi asks the
u6DYuipcwiE,519039,520800,arrogant kid about why he called himself
u6DYuipcwiE,520800,522880,a pro earlier and he explains that he's
u6DYuipcwiE,522880,524720,played the card game before but never in
u6DYuipcwiE,524720,526720,a death game like this he tells them
u6DYuipcwiE,526720,528720,there should be more roles like asir who
u6DYuipcwiE,528720,530560,has a special ability to find out the
u6DYuipcwiE,530560,532720,role of one player each night but since
u6DYuipcwiE,532720,534640,this is the first round no one can be
u6DYuipcwiE,534640,536800,sure who among them is a werewolf they
u6DYuipcwiE,536800,538640,have only 30 minutes left to decide who
u6DYuipcwiE,538640,540320,to vote for because if they don't kill
u6DYuipcwiE,540320,542880,someone by 9 pm the rules state that all
u6DYuipcwiE,542880,545200,of them will die that's when ire here
u6DYuipcwiE,545200,547040,finally realizes to have to actually
u6DYuipcwiE,547040,548959,murder someone with their own hands and
u6DYuipcwiE,548959,550640,scolds them all for even considering it
u6DYuipcwiE,550640,553279,as an option but the girl is being naive
u6DYuipcwiE,553279,555600,angry hitomi here stands up and grabs
u6DYuipcwiE,555600,557279,her by the collar if she doesn't want to
u6DYuipcwiE,557279,559360,play the game then she's better off dead
u6DYuipcwiE,559360,561360,dragging the girl towards the door she's
u6DYuipcwiE,561360,563200,about to throw her out of the building
u6DYuipcwiE,563200,565360,when tomohiro rushes in to stop her
u6DYuipcwiE,565360,567279,saving iri's life
u6DYuipcwiE,567279,570080,okay this girl is being really naive and
u6DYuipcwiE,570080,571680,refusing to cooperate makes her an
u6DYuipcwiE,571680,573519,instant liability to the whole group
u6DYuipcwiE,573519,575440,everyone will die if she doesn't vote so
u6DYuipcwiE,575440,577279,the girl needs to be dealt with but it
u6DYuipcwiE,577279,578959,also doesn't make sense to vote for her
u6DYuipcwiE,578959,580959,execution since we know that she's a
u6DYuipcwiE,580959,582560,villager and the wolves would have to
u6DYuipcwiE,582560,584240,kill someone tonight i would suggest
u6DYuipcwiE,584240,585760,that we sacrifice her as a peace
u6DYuipcwiE,585760,587839,offering and everyone else can survive
u6DYuipcwiE,587839,590000,into the next round now as villagers we
u6DYuipcwiE,590000,591600,have a very interesting dilemma here
u6DYuipcwiE,591600,593519,because our numbers can actually work
u6DYuipcwiE,593519,595920,against us if we're not careful remember
u6DYuipcwiE,595920,597600,that we started with 8 villagers and
u6DYuipcwiE,597600,599920,only 2 werewolves so as a villager
u6DYuipcwiE,599920,601519,voting without evidence would give us a
u6DYuipcwiE,601519,603839,78 chance of accidentally killing
u6DYuipcwiE,603839,605839,someone on our team out of the nine
u6DYuipcwiE,605839,608160,other players in this case we have one
u6DYuipcwiE,608160,610160,girl already dead and if she was a
u6DYuipcwiE,610160,613120,villager we now have a 75 chance of
u6DYuipcwiE,613120,614959,killing another villager with our vote
u6DYuipcwiE,614959,617040,out of the eight remaining players every
u6DYuipcwiE,617040,618880,time we do this we are hurting our own
u6DYuipcwiE,618880,620720,chances of winning by killing another
u6DYuipcwiE,620720,622160,villager which is exactly what a
u6DYuipcwiE,622160,624079,werewolf wants to happen and it's why we
u6DYuipcwiE,624079,625839,need good evidence to back up our
u6DYuipcwiE,625839,627839,decisions now if we can see what
u6DYuipcwiE,627839,629120,strategies the wolves have at their
u6DYuipcwiE,629120,631120,disposal then we can anticipate their
u6DYuipcwiE,631120,633040,decisions and avoid falling into their
u6DYuipcwiE,633040,635600,traps for starters the wolves will want
u6DYuipcwiE,635600,637519,to sow chaos into the group as soon as
u6DYuipcwiE,637519,639600,possible because the more emotional we
u6DYuipcwiE,639600,641519,all are the easier it is for us to be
u6DYuipcwiE,641519,643519,manipulated to vote without using logic
u6DYuipcwiE,643519,645839,or reason that means as villagers we
u6DYuipcwiE,645839,647519,need to be very careful not to start
u6DYuipcwiE,647519,650000,killing based on our emotions these two
u6DYuipcwiE,650000,651920,girls getting into a fight is the exact
u6DYuipcwiE,651920,653519,opposite of what we need right now but
u6DYuipcwiE,653519,655600,it also tells us what their roles are a
u6DYuipcwiE,655600,657120,werewolf doesn't want to draw that kind
u6DYuipcwiE,657120,658640,of attention to themselves so they're
u6DYuipcwiE,658640,660880,both more likely to be villagers if we
u6DYuipcwiE,660880,662640,also assume that the first girl who died
u6DYuipcwiE,662640,664480,was a villager then taking these three
u6DYuipcwiE,664480,666399,girls out of consideration gives us a
u6DYuipcwiE,666399,668079,better statistical advantage that we can
u6DYuipcwiE,668079,670160,pick a werewolf to kill we also wouldn't
u6DYuipcwiE,670160,672079,vote for ourselves so with two wolves
u6DYuipcwiE,672079,674079,among six other players remaining that's
u6DYuipcwiE,674079,676480,a 33 chance of finding a werewolf at
u6DYuipcwiE,676480,678480,random i would also want to protect this
u6DYuipcwiE,678480,680320,pro here because if he has more insight
u6DYuipcwiE,680320,681760,into the game then he's going to be
u6DYuipcwiE,681760,683120,incredibly valuable to helping the
u6DYuipcwiE,683120,685120,villagers win we can't be sure he's not
u6DYuipcwiE,685120,686720,a werewolf but his knowledge and
u6DYuipcwiE,686720,688959,experience makes him worth the risk now
u6DYuipcwiE,688959,690320,that we've narrowed down our selection
u6DYuipcwiE,690320,692160,to five players we can figure out who
u6DYuipcwiE,692160,693600,among them we have more reason to be
u6DYuipcwiE,693600,695600,suspicious of since werewolves are only
u6DYuipcwiE,695600,696880,killed during votes then they're
u6DYuipcwiE,696880,698320,probably going to appear on their best
u6DYuipcwiE,698320,700399,behavior to avoid negative attention
u6DYuipcwiE,700399,702079,that means the nicest and friendliest
u6DYuipcwiE,702079,703600,people are the ones you should be the
u6DYuipcwiE,703600,705600,most suspicious of if any of these
u6DYuipcwiE,705600,707279,players start signing too friendly it
u6DYuipcwiE,707279,708959,might be a telltale sign that they're a
u6DYuipcwiE,708959,711120,werewolf and they should be interrogated
u6DYuipcwiE,711120,712959,with time running out voomi the pro
u6DYuipcwiE,712959,714560,tells everyone to point at who they
u6DYuipcwiE,714560,716399,think the werewolf is and on the count
u6DYuipcwiE,716399,718639,of three the group votes the older
u6DYuipcwiE,718639,721040,sister got two votes the pro got two
u6DYuipcwiE,721040,723279,votes takeshi got two votes the nerd and
u6DYuipcwiE,723279,725120,the villager both got one vote but
u6DYuipcwiE,725120,727120,that's when they all realize iri here
u6DYuipcwiE,727120,729440,voted for no one by refusing to play
u6DYuipcwiE,729440,731279,she's putting all their lives in danger
u6DYuipcwiE,731279,733120,and the nerd begs her to break the time
u6DYuipcwiE,733120,735120,reluctantly irie here agrees and on the
u6DYuipcwiE,735120,736480,count of three they all point their
u6DYuipcwiE,736480,738399,fingers for the second time everyone
u6DYuipcwiE,738399,740320,casts the same boat as before except
u6DYuipcwiE,740320,742000,irene who has decided to vote for the
u6DYuipcwiE,742000,744000,nerd it takes him by complete surprise
u6DYuipcwiE,744000,745440,and he lashes out at her for not
u6DYuipcwiE,745440,747440,breaking the time that's when this girl
u6DYuipcwiE,747440,749440,reveals that earlier fumi had a secret
u6DYuipcwiE,749440,750800,meeting where he tried convincing them
u6DYuipcwiE,750800,752480,to vote against takeshi here and this
u6DYuipcwiE,752480,754320,one statement turns the whole group
u6DYuipcwiE,754320,756399,against him this girl reminds them that
u6DYuipcwiE,756399,757920,three different students all got equal
u6DYuipcwiE,757920,759360,votes again and they still need a
u6DYuipcwiE,759360,760959,tiebreaker on the count of three
u6DYuipcwiE,760959,762399,everyone points their fingers and it's
u6DYuipcwiE,762399,764399,no surprise who they've chosen seven
u6DYuipcwiE,764399,766560,players vote for fumi the pro fumi votes
u6DYuipcwiE,766560,768000,for the pretty boy takeshi and the
u6DYuipcwiE,768000,770639,villager irie votes for herself the boy
u6DYuipcwiE,770639,772000,starts to break down into tears
u6DYuipcwiE,772000,773920,realizing he's going to die and there's
u6DYuipcwiE,773920,776320,nothing he can say or do to stop it some
u6DYuipcwiE,776320,778240,of the players go to a back room where a
u6DYuipcwiE,778240,779760,bottle of cyanide has been left for them
u6DYuipcwiE,779760,781440,and they look at the instructions it
u6DYuipcwiE,781440,783200,will take five minutes for the poison to
u6DYuipcwiE,783200,784880,kill their victims but warns that if
u6DYuipcwiE,784880,786639,they're not careful even slight contact
u6DYuipcwiE,786639,788399,with this poison will kill them fumi
u6DYuipcwiE,788399,790240,here is so terrified that he wets his
u6DYuipcwiE,790240,792160,pants and begs the villager girl to help
u6DYuipcwiE,792160,793760,him but she's too traumatized to do
u6DYuipcwiE,793760,796000,anything about it the boy suddenly goes
u6DYuipcwiE,796000,797920,for broke and tries to escape but the
u6DYuipcwiE,797920,799680,others manage to catch him and pin him
u6DYuipcwiE,799680,801760,to the ground the older sister marie
u6DYuipcwiE,801760,803360,prepares the poison and they try to
u6DYuipcwiE,803360,804959,force the poor kid to drink it but he
u6DYuipcwiE,804959,807200,thrashes around desperate to survive
u6DYuipcwiE,807200,809120,finally the boy surrenders to his fate
u6DYuipcwiE,809120,810800,and runs out of the room to dilate the
u6DYuipcwiE,810800,812720,first skrill and that's now two players
u6DYuipcwiE,812720,814800,down with eight to go
u6DYuipcwiE,814800,817360,okay i gotta say trying to kill someone
u6DYuipcwiE,817360,819440,with potassium cyanide is a really
u6DYuipcwiE,819440,821519,terrible idea first of all when they
u6DYuipcwiE,821519,823440,read the instructions it told them that
u6DYuipcwiE,823440,825279,even slight contact with this poison is
u6DYuipcwiE,825279,826959,enough to kill you and since we can't
u6DYuipcwiE,826959,828560,expect the victim to cooperate
u6DYuipcwiE,828560,830480,force-feeding and poison is extremely
u6DYuipcwiE,830480,832639,dangerous to the other players it's very
u6DYuipcwiE,832639,834399,likely that the chemicals will splash on
u6DYuipcwiE,834399,836000,the others killing anyone that gets
u6DYuipcwiE,836000,837839,enough on them just because the game
u6DYuipcwiE,837839,839600,provided it for us doesn't mean we have
u6DYuipcwiE,839600,841199,to use it and it would have been much
u6DYuipcwiE,841199,843040,smarter to push him out the door and let
u6DYuipcwiE,843040,845360,the death game do the job for us right
u6DYuipcwiE,845360,847440,now it's eight against one and even if
u6DYuipcwiE,847440,849680,he resists we won't be risking our lives
u6DYuipcwiE,849680,851440,in the process now from the other
u6DYuipcwiE,851440,853519,perspective if i was this kid who's
u6DYuipcwiE,853519,855199,supposed to die the fact that they're
u6DYuipcwiE,855199,857360,deciding to use poison is actually a
u6DYuipcwiE,857360,859360,blessing in disguise instead of
u6DYuipcwiE,859360,861120,literally peeing his pants he should
u6DYuipcwiE,861120,862639,have been looking for an opportunity to
u6DYuipcwiE,862639,864240,knock this tray of cyanide into their
u6DYuipcwiE,864240,866399,faces the rules stated that each night
u6DYuipcwiE,866399,868079,they have to kill the person they voted
u6DYuipcwiE,868079,869920,for but there might be a way to hack
u6DYuipcwiE,869920,872079,this if we managed to kill someone else
u6DYuipcwiE,872079,873839,by splashing them with their own poison
u6DYuipcwiE,873839,875440,then we could convince the group to
u6DYuipcwiE,875440,877600,revoke and point to the dead body as an
u6DYuipcwiE,877600,880000,easy way to finish the round now even at
u6DYuipcwiE,880000,881920,the point where he was being poisoned he
u6DYuipcwiE,881920,883760,still might have had a chance to survive
u6DYuipcwiE,883760,886000,if he was using his brain potassium
u6DYuipcwiE,886000,888160,cyanide is composed of carbon nitrogen
u6DYuipcwiE,888160,890079,ions that are extremely toxic to the
u6DYuipcwiE,890079,892079,human body but a common emergency
u6DYuipcwiE,892079,893839,treatment for cyanide poisoning is
u6DYuipcwiE,893839,895920,activated charcoal because it attracts
u6DYuipcwiE,895920,898000,those toxic ions and absorbs them away
u6DYuipcwiE,898000,900079,from your body it might be a long shot
u6DYuipcwiE,900079,902000,but if i was minutes away from death
u6DYuipcwiE,902000,903440,instead of running out the door and
u6DYuipcwiE,903440,905279,quitting i would run to the kitchen to
u6DYuipcwiE,905279,907040,look inside the fridge for activated
u6DYuipcwiE,907040,909120,charcoal many asian countries use this
u6DYuipcwiE,909120,910959,to deodorize their fridges and i
u6DYuipcwiE,910959,912399,definitely eat it if i thought it would
u6DYuipcwiE,912399,915279,save my life suddenly a vhs pops out of
u6DYuipcwiE,915279,917040,the tape player and the tv tells them
u6DYuipcwiE,917040,919120,that from midnight to 6am the villagers
u6DYuipcwiE,919120,920320,must stay in their rooms while the
u6DYuipcwiE,920320,922320,werewolves come out to kill one player
u6DYuipcwiE,922320,924079,advent says that one of the villagers
u6DYuipcwiE,924079,925920,has a special role called the seer who
u6DYuipcwiE,925920,927680,can choose one player's role to reveal
u6DYuipcwiE,927680,929920,each knight the nerd realizes this can
u6DYuipcwiE,929920,931600,help them find out who the werewolves
u6DYuipcwiE,931600,933519,are but they have no idea who this year
u6DYuipcwiE,933519,935600,could be later the groove meets in the
u6DYuipcwiE,935600,937199,back room to prepare for the werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,937199,938880,attack and the older sister suggests
u6DYuipcwiE,938880,940240,they should all try to listen for the
u6DYuipcwiE,940240,942320,wolves voices to figure out who they are
u6DYuipcwiE,942320,944240,takeshi here asks whoever the werewolves
u6DYuipcwiE,944240,946000,are to not kill anyone tonight so they
u6DYuipcwiE,946000,948399,can all buy time to escape but tomohiro
u6DYuipcwiE,948399,950639,explains that it's an impossible request
u6DYuipcwiE,950639,952320,if the werewolves don't kill each knight
u6DYuipcwiE,952320,954000,then they will both die as a punishment
u6DYuipcwiE,954000,956320,and lose the game later that night all
u6DYuipcwiE,956320,958000,the players go to their rooms to sleep
u6DYuipcwiE,958000,960160,but the villager irie is hiding under
u6DYuipcwiE,960160,962240,her bed she's terrified of being killed
u6DYuipcwiE,962240,964320,by the wolves but suddenly a gunshot
u6DYuipcwiE,964320,966240,rings out from another room someone's
u6DYuipcwiE,966240,967519,just been murdered and the girls
u6DYuipcwiE,967519,969440,relieved that they didn't choose her the
u6DYuipcwiE,969440,970959,next morning she joins the others to
u6DYuipcwiE,970959,972800,find the dead body of the quiet boy you
u6DYuipcwiE,972800,974800,hate in his bed and it's gruesome the
u6DYuipcwiE,974800,976160,pretty boy tells her they checked the
u6DYuipcwiE,976160,977680,other rooms but couldn't find the gun
u6DYuipcwiE,977680,979759,that shot him tomohiro leaves the room
u6DYuipcwiE,979759,981360,and the villager is about to follow him
u6DYuipcwiE,981360,982880,but she's warned that he might be a
u6DYuipcwiE,982880,985199,werewolf later they drag the body out of
u6DYuipcwiE,985199,986560,the room and dump it outside the
u6DYuipcwiE,986560,988800,building that afternoon the villager is
u6DYuipcwiE,988800,990480,about to enter her room when she stops
u6DYuipcwiE,990480,992079,with a nerd who invites her to a private
u6DYuipcwiE,992079,994079,meeting the three gather in the kitchen
u6DYuipcwiE,994079,995680,where the boy tells him he's discovered
u6DYuipcwiE,995680,997680,some answers the last victim must have
u6DYuipcwiE,997680,999440,been a villager since he was killed and
u6DYuipcwiE,999440,1000959,if both of the other two players that
u6DYuipcwiE,1000959,1002880,died were villagers too he thinks the
u6DYuipcwiE,1002880,1004959,werewolves could win in three days time
u6DYuipcwiE,1004959,1006720,he begs irie here to tell them if she
u6DYuipcwiE,1006720,1008480,has any clue who the wolves are but the
u6DYuipcwiE,1008480,1010800,girl stays quiet marie here asks how he
u6DYuipcwiE,1010800,1012560,knows that they aren't werewolves and he
u6DYuipcwiE,1012560,1014320,tells her it's a risk he needed to take
u6DYuipcwiE,1014320,1016399,if they want any chance of winning
u6DYuipcwiE,1016399,1019199,okay this is the dumbest nerd i've ever
u6DYuipcwiE,1019199,1021360,seen he randomly trusted two girls
u6DYuipcwiE,1021360,1022959,without vetting their roles and it's
u6DYuipcwiE,1022959,1025038,going to get him killed if he had done
u6DYuipcwiE,1025038,1026798,the math he would have realized that
u6DYuipcwiE,1026798,1028480,with only seven players in the game
u6DYuipcwiE,1028480,1030959,right now and three villagers eliminated
u6DYuipcwiE,1030959,1033120,the combined chances that at least one
u6DYuipcwiE,1033120,1036079,of these girls as a werewolf is 60
u6DYuipcwiE,1036079,1037600,and when your very life is hanging in
u6DYuipcwiE,1037600,1039600,the balance those are terrible odds to
u6DYuipcwiE,1039600,1042240,gamble with the truth is these private
u6DYuipcwiE,1042240,1043839,conversations are the death game
u6DYuipcwiE,1043839,1046000,equivalent of russian roulette and even
u6DYuipcwiE,1046000,1047678,if it can help you win the game it
u6DYuipcwiE,1047678,1049760,requires too much luck to consider it an
u6DYuipcwiE,1049760,1052000,effective strategy now the safest way to
u6DYuipcwiE,1052000,1053679,figure out who the werewolves are is in
u6DYuipcwiE,1053679,1055520,the next voting round and since the
u6DYuipcwiE,1055520,1057440,wolves just killed someone last night we
u6DYuipcwiE,1057440,1059440,can turn that into a huge advantage if
u6DYuipcwiE,1059440,1061840,we know what to look for for starters we
u6DYuipcwiE,1061840,1063520,can predict that the werewolves are
u6DYuipcwiE,1063520,1065280,going to protect their fellow wolf so
u6DYuipcwiE,1065280,1067120,they will never vote for each other when
u6DYuipcwiE,1067120,1068880,there's not a lot of information to go
u6DYuipcwiE,1068880,1070880,on it would be very suspicious to have
u6DYuipcwiE,1070880,1073039,one person constantly defending someone
u6DYuipcwiE,1073039,1075280,else and it's an immediate red flag we
u6DYuipcwiE,1075280,1077280,can also expect the werewolves to be the
u6DYuipcwiE,1077280,1079280,only ones in the group to intentionally
u6DYuipcwiE,1079280,1081760,mislead others this will often mean that
u6DYuipcwiE,1081760,1083120,the wolves will either be the most
u6DYuipcwiE,1083120,1085600,accusatory or the most vocal but they
u6DYuipcwiE,1085600,1087600,will never seem to be neutral or looking
u6DYuipcwiE,1087600,1090240,for fairness lastly we can tell a lot
u6DYuipcwiE,1090240,1092000,from everyone's facial expressions
u6DYuipcwiE,1092000,1093600,because to keep a deadly secret like
u6DYuipcwiE,1093600,1095919,this is not an easy burden to carry even
u6DYuipcwiE,1095919,1097600,though a werewolf can rationalize their
u6DYuipcwiE,1097600,1099679,actions for survival the guilt of
u6DYuipcwiE,1099679,1101760,murdering someone in cold blood is going
u6DYuipcwiE,1101760,1103919,to reflect in their physical appearance
u6DYuipcwiE,1103919,1106000,someone in this room shot another
u6DYuipcwiE,1106000,1107760,student in the head and that's not
u6DYuipcwiE,1107760,1109840,something that you can easily hide so
u6DYuipcwiE,1109840,1111679,anyone who looks burdened or avoids eye
u6DYuipcwiE,1111679,1113919,contact should be considered a suspect
u6DYuipcwiE,1113919,1115840,with this strategy we could easily
u6DYuipcwiE,1115840,1117360,convince the others to vote against
u6DYuipcwiE,1117360,1118960,whoever is showing these physical
u6DYuipcwiE,1118960,1121039,symptoms and it's logical enough to help
u6DYuipcwiE,1121039,1123360,swing the vote now with the group starts
u6DYuipcwiE,1123360,1125600,to agree with our theory the other wolf
u6DYuipcwiE,1125600,1127280,is going to be defending their partner
u6DYuipcwiE,1127280,1129520,as much as possible and that means we
u6DYuipcwiE,1129520,1131840,can catch the other werewolf too if all
u6DYuipcwiE,1131840,1134160,goes well finding those detailed signals
u6DYuipcwiE,1134160,1136080,of trauma can be enough to turn this
u6DYuipcwiE,1136080,1138000,entire game around and we don't have to
u6DYuipcwiE,1138000,1139600,risk our lives and any private
u6DYuipcwiE,1139600,1141760,conversation like this guy did that
u6DYuipcwiE,1141760,1143840,night the second voting session begins
u6DYuipcwiE,1143840,1145600,and the older sister here decides to
u6DYuipcwiE,1145600,1148000,announce that she has the seer role she
u6DYuipcwiE,1148000,1149440,claims that she checked the nerdy kid
u6DYuipcwiE,1149440,1151120,yesterday to discover that he's a
u6DYuipcwiE,1151120,1152880,werewolf and that's the only reason
u6DYuipcwiE,1152880,1154960,she's chosen to finally reveal her role
u6DYuipcwiE,1154960,1156799,the nerd insists he's a villager and
u6DYuipcwiE,1156799,1158559,this false accusation could only mean
u6DYuipcwiE,1158559,1160720,that she's the wolf the group doesn't
u6DYuipcwiE,1160720,1162240,know who to trust but that's when
u6DYuipcwiE,1162240,1164080,takeshi here declares that he's the real
u6DYuipcwiE,1164080,1166640,seer and that marie is lying everyone is
u6DYuipcwiE,1166640,1168400,surprised by this but the older sister
u6DYuipcwiE,1168400,1170160,takes it personally yelling that he and
u6DYuipcwiE,1170160,1172799,the nerd must both be werewolves the boy
u6DYuipcwiE,1172799,1174480,challenges her to tell the group exactly
u6DYuipcwiE,1174480,1176240,how the series ability works and if she
u6DYuipcwiE,1176240,1177760,can't then it will prove that she's
u6DYuipcwiE,1177760,1180240,lying but the girl is quick to answer
u6DYuipcwiE,1180240,1182880,between 12 to 2am she can use the tv in
u6DYuipcwiE,1182880,1184799,her room to choose one player and find
u6DYuipcwiE,1184799,1186559,out their role and also has a special
u6DYuipcwiE,1186559,1188720,symbol on her card the pretty boy is
u6DYuipcwiE,1188720,1190400,completely caught off guard and can't
u6DYuipcwiE,1190400,1192000,understand how she could possibly know
u6DYuipcwiE,1192000,1194320,this desperate he swears to the group
u6DYuipcwiE,1194320,1196080,that he's really the seer but the big
u6DYuipcwiE,1196080,1197440,sister suggests that he's trying to
u6DYuipcwiE,1197440,1198880,protect the nerdy kid because they're
u6DYuipcwiE,1198880,1201440,both werewolves angry he pushes her out
u6DYuipcwiE,1201440,1203440,of the circle but tomohiro here rushes
u6DYuipcwiE,1203440,1205120,in to calm them down with only 30
u6DYuipcwiE,1205120,1206640,minutes left on the clock the group
u6DYuipcwiE,1206640,1208880,decides to vote four people vote for the
u6DYuipcwiE,1208880,1210640,nerd two people vote for the older
u6DYuipcwiE,1210640,1212320,sister and the villager votes for
u6DYuipcwiE,1212320,1214480,herself making the nerd the fourth
u6DYuipcwiE,1214480,1216880,victim of the game after the vote they
u6DYuipcwiE,1216880,1219039,clear the room to prepare the poison no
u6DYuipcwiE,1219039,1220799,one wants to execute this kid and he
u6DYuipcwiE,1220799,1222640,tells them he's terrified of dying
u6DYuipcwiE,1222640,1224880,tomohiro apologizes and begins to cry
u6DYuipcwiE,1224880,1226480,with guilt but none of them have a
u6DYuipcwiE,1226480,1228320,choice the group is about to force the
u6DYuipcwiE,1228320,1230400,nerd to drink the poison but he suddenly
u6DYuipcwiE,1230400,1232080,panics bolting out of the chair and
u6DYuipcwiE,1232080,1234080,towards the stairs he's caught by the
u6DYuipcwiE,1234080,1235679,other players who wrestle him to the
u6DYuipcwiE,1235679,1237440,ground and the villager tries to protect
u6DYuipcwiE,1237440,1239679,him but it's no use they finally manage
u6DYuipcwiE,1239679,1241360,to poison the nerd and the group watches
u6DYuipcwiE,1241360,1242799,or tears in their eyes as the next
u6DYuipcwiE,1242799,1244960,victim passes away everyone is dead
u6DYuipcwiE,1244960,1246880,quiet and the younger sister angrily
u6DYuipcwiE,1246880,1248400,walks up to the television set before
u6DYuipcwiE,1248400,1250159,throwing it to the floor smashing it to
u6DYuipcwiE,1250159,1252320,pieces knowing that tonight someone else
u6DYuipcwiE,1252320,1253360,will die
u6DYuipcwiE,1253360,1255600,okay this was a master class in
u6DYuipcwiE,1255600,1257600,stupidity because the group had plenty
u6DYuipcwiE,1257600,1259520,of signs that pointed to modi being a
u6DYuipcwiE,1259520,1261919,werewolf the first problem here is that
u6DYuipcwiE,1261919,1263840,claiming to be the seer is an extremely
u6DYuipcwiE,1263840,1265919,dangerous thing to do other versions of
u6DYuipcwiE,1265919,1267919,the werewolf game have a bodyguard role
u6DYuipcwiE,1267919,1270000,which can protect one player each night
u6DYuipcwiE,1270000,1272480,but this version doesn't have one since
u6DYuipcwiE,1272480,1274480,a seer is the only person that can
u6DYuipcwiE,1274480,1276640,discover another player's role then this
u6DYuipcwiE,1276640,1278159,makes them the biggest threat to the
u6DYuipcwiE,1278159,1279919,werewolf's chances of winning with
u6DYuipcwiE,1279919,1282080,nobody to protect you revealing yourself
u6DYuipcwiE,1282080,1284400,to be the seer is a death wish which is
u6DYuipcwiE,1284400,1286400,why money's admission here is very
u6DYuipcwiE,1286400,1289039,suspicious the only logical explanation
u6DYuipcwiE,1289039,1290720,for painting a target on her back like
u6DYuipcwiE,1290720,1293039,this is if she is actually a werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,1293039,1294720,because she has no fear of getting
u6DYuipcwiE,1294720,1296799,murdered this is a common werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,1296799,1298720,tactic to gain the others trust before
u6DYuipcwiE,1298720,1300720,the true seer reveals themselves and if
u6DYuipcwiE,1300720,1302240,the villagers have been more focused on
u6DYuipcwiE,1302240,1304000,the game's dynamics instead of getting
u6DYuipcwiE,1304000,1305600,caught up in the drama they could have
u6DYuipcwiE,1305600,1307760,easily predicted this would happen now
u6DYuipcwiE,1307760,1309360,there was one more thing these villagers
u6DYuipcwiE,1309360,1311120,could have done to prove that moliere
u6DYuipcwiE,1311120,1312559,isn't telling the truth and that's
u6DYuipcwiE,1312559,1314320,keeping track of everyone's votes in
u6DYuipcwiE,1314320,1316880,each round the night before this nerdy
u6DYuipcwiE,1316880,1318799,kid voted for the pretty boy and since a
u6DYuipcwiE,1318799,1320559,werewolf would never vote for the other
u6DYuipcwiE,1320559,1322320,wolf this would prove that they're both
u6DYuipcwiE,1322320,1324720,villagers it's also important to realize
u6DYuipcwiE,1324720,1326559,that the pretty boy is now defending the
u6DYuipcwiE,1326559,1328240,person who had previously accused him of
u6DYuipcwiE,1328240,1330000,being the werewolf which wouldn't make
u6DYuipcwiE,1330000,1332240,any sense unless he had true information
u6DYuipcwiE,1332240,1334320,to back it up keeping track of the votes
u6DYuipcwiE,1334320,1335919,here could have changed this whole game
u6DYuipcwiE,1335919,1337919,and exposed one of the werewolves but
u6DYuipcwiE,1337919,1339760,instead they used their emotions to make
u6DYuipcwiE,1339760,1342400,their decisions and now they're screwed
u6DYuipcwiE,1342400,1344159,later the group moves the nerd's corpse
u6DYuipcwiE,1344159,1345440,out of the voting room to dump it
u6DYuipcwiE,1345440,1347200,outside the older sister tells the
u6DYuipcwiE,1347200,1348720,villager that since she didn't vote for
u6DYuipcwiE,1348720,1350720,the nerd the girl can't be trusted she
u6DYuipcwiE,1350720,1352240,warns you to make the right decision in
u6DYuipcwiE,1352240,1353840,the next round or else they'll lose the
u6DYuipcwiE,1353840,1356080,game and it's going to be her fault
u6DYuipcwiE,1356080,1358159,after dumping the body the girl realizes
u6DYuipcwiE,1358159,1360159,nobody trusts her and starts to cry
u6DYuipcwiE,1360159,1362080,tomohiro reassures her that everything
u6DYuipcwiE,1362080,1363679,is going to work out just as it's meant
u6DYuipcwiE,1363679,1365360,to but she's going to find out that this
u6DYuipcwiE,1365360,1367520,kid is hiding a dangerous secret the
u6DYuipcwiE,1367520,1369360,next morning the players find that this
u6DYuipcwiE,1369360,1370880,girl he told me has been killed by the
u6DYuipcwiE,1370880,1373200,werewolves upstairs the younger sister
u6DYuipcwiE,1373200,1374640,comes knocking the villager's door
u6DYuipcwiE,1374640,1376559,because she's figured something out the
u6DYuipcwiE,1376559,1378240,other girl shows her a diagram of how
u6DYuipcwiE,1378240,1379919,the votes were distributed in each round
u6DYuipcwiE,1379919,1382159,so far and that's when ire begins to see
u6DYuipcwiE,1382159,1384159,a pattern emerge analyzing all the
u6DYuipcwiE,1384159,1385919,voting records she realized that
u6DYuipcwiE,1385919,1387280,werewolves will never vote for each
u6DYuipcwiE,1387280,1389120,other and would instead both target a
u6DYuipcwiE,1389120,1391440,single person but on the first night the
u6DYuipcwiE,1391440,1393600,nerd voted for takeshi that means
u6DYuipcwiE,1393600,1395360,they're both most likely villagers and
u6DYuipcwiE,1395360,1397280,konomi here realizes that her sister
u6DYuipcwiE,1397280,1399440,must really be a werewolf since they're
u6DYuipcwiE,1399440,1401280,on opposite teams only one of these
u6DYuipcwiE,1401280,1402960,girls will be able to win the game and
u6DYuipcwiE,1402960,1405039,the little sister breaks down crying
u6DYuipcwiE,1405039,1406720,that night the third voting session
u6DYuipcwiE,1406720,1408720,begins and they find a brand new tv
u6DYuipcwiE,1408720,1411039,sitting on the stand in tears the older
u6DYuipcwiE,1411039,1412880,sister admits she's a werewolf and has
u6DYuipcwiE,1412880,1414880,decided to reveal her role to sacrifice
u6DYuipcwiE,1414880,1416880,herself so her sister can live it's a
u6DYuipcwiE,1416880,1418480,noble gesture but then she drops a
u6DYuipcwiE,1418480,1420080,bombshell in the group and claims this
u6DYuipcwiE,1420080,1422720,guy tomohiro is the other werewolf he
u6DYuipcwiE,1422720,1424960,denies the accusation but marie insists
u6DYuipcwiE,1424960,1426799,he was with her for each killing in
u6DYuipcwiE,1426799,1428559,tears she tells everyone that she just
u6DYuipcwiE,1428559,1430400,wants to keep her sister safe and her
u6DYuipcwiE,1430400,1432320,original plan was to get tomohiro killed
u6DYuipcwiE,1432320,1434480,once people believed she was a seer the
u6DYuipcwiE,1434480,1436000,boy can't believe what he's hearing but
u6DYuipcwiE,1436000,1437760,with tai running out the players decide
u6DYuipcwiE,1437760,1440240,to vote two people vote for tomohiro and
u6DYuipcwiE,1440240,1442400,three people vote for marie
u6DYuipcwiE,1442400,1445600,okay this was unexpected maria here just
u6DYuipcwiE,1445600,1447360,tanked the werewolf's chances of winning
u6DYuipcwiE,1447360,1449279,by giving herself up and she's doing it
u6DYuipcwiE,1449279,1450960,to save her sister here who is a
u6DYuipcwiE,1450960,1453360,villager this is a very honorable thing
u6DYuipcwiE,1453360,1455760,to do but there's one catch she's
u6DYuipcwiE,1455760,1457919,accusing this boy tomohiro of being the
u6DYuipcwiE,1457919,1459840,other werewolf but we can't guarantee
u6DYuipcwiE,1459840,1462159,that we can trust her and here's why in
u6DYuipcwiE,1462159,1464240,the previous round marie claimed to be
u6DYuipcwiE,1464240,1466400,the seer which means she was most likely
u6DYuipcwiE,1466400,1468159,to get killed by the werewolves but
u6DYuipcwiE,1468159,1469919,since she wasn't murdered it made her
u6DYuipcwiE,1469919,1472320,look suspicious she knew this would blow
u6DYuipcwiE,1472320,1474159,her cover and was going to get killed in
u6DYuipcwiE,1474159,1476400,the next vote no matter what if that's
u6DYuipcwiE,1476400,1478159,the case then it's still logical to
u6DYuipcwiE,1478159,1480080,consider the possibility that her sister
u6DYuipcwiE,1480080,1481760,could be the second werewolf and she's
u6DYuipcwiE,1481760,1483120,misdirecting the group to keep her
u6DYuipcwiE,1483120,1485760,sister alive now there are two things we
u6DYuipcwiE,1485760,1487679,can do to reveal who the second werewolf
u6DYuipcwiE,1487679,1490080,is and the first is the voting record if
u6DYuipcwiE,1490080,1491760,the werewolves were smart then they
u6DYuipcwiE,1491760,1493600,probably voted for the same person each
u6DYuipcwiE,1493600,1494880,night because it would give them a
u6DYuipcwiE,1494880,1496480,higher chance of having the majority
u6DYuipcwiE,1496480,1498880,vote the records would clearly show who
u6DYuipcwiE,1498880,1500480,among the remaining players voted the
u6DYuipcwiE,1500480,1502799,same every time and if either these two
u6DYuipcwiE,1502799,1504720,suspects voted differently it's a good
u6DYuipcwiE,1504720,1506880,sign that they're just a villager now
u6DYuipcwiE,1506880,1508640,the second way we can reveal the other
u6DYuipcwiE,1508640,1510480,werewolf is by observing how people
u6DYuipcwiE,1510480,1513120,behave during the day tomohiro has been
u6DYuipcwiE,1513120,1515200,acting very nice towards irene in doing
u6DYuipcwiE,1515200,1516640,everything he can to help her feel
u6DYuipcwiE,1516640,1518799,comfortable while this seems innocent
u6DYuipcwiE,1518799,1520640,these are the telltale signs of
u6DYuipcwiE,1520640,1522960,manipulation tactics he's gone out of
u6DYuipcwiE,1522960,1524720,his way to gain the trust of this girl
u6DYuipcwiE,1524720,1526400,to make himself appear non-threatening
u6DYuipcwiE,1526400,1527919,and it's a brilliant strategy to help
u6DYuipcwiE,1527919,1530080,swing the votes away from him he's also
u6DYuipcwiE,1530080,1531600,been relatively quiet in each voting
u6DYuipcwiE,1531600,1533360,session and only makes contributions
u6DYuipcwiE,1533360,1535279,when it's expected of him these are the
u6DYuipcwiE,1535279,1536720,actions of someone who is trying to
u6DYuipcwiE,1536720,1539120,avoid suspicion at all cost ada lines up
u6DYuipcwiE,1539120,1541200,perfectly with modie's claim that he's
u6DYuipcwiE,1541200,1543279,the second werewolf with all that in
u6DYuipcwiE,1543279,1545600,mind we still have a problem killing
u6DYuipcwiE,1545600,1547360,marie will get the villagers one step
u6DYuipcwiE,1547360,1549120,closer to winning but there's one more
u6DYuipcwiE,1549120,1551600,werewolf remaining tomohiro is going to
u6DYuipcwiE,1551600,1553360,kill another villager tonight and that's
u6DYuipcwiE,1553360,1555279,why i would use this opportunity to test
u6DYuipcwiE,1555279,1557279,the game the rules said that we have to
u6DYuipcwiE,1557279,1558960,vote for who the werewolf is and kill
u6DYuipcwiE,1558960,1560880,them but it didn't say anything about
u6DYuipcwiE,1560880,1562559,only being allowed to kill one player
u6DYuipcwiE,1562559,1564400,each night i would suggest to the
u6DYuipcwiE,1564400,1566000,remaining villagers that we should cast
u6DYuipcwiE,1566000,1567840,a second vote and choose tomohiro to
u6DYuipcwiE,1567840,1569679,kill him tonight as well and since it's
u6DYuipcwiE,1569679,1571120,following the rules exactly as they've
u6DYuipcwiE,1571120,1573200,been written it's worth trying the
u6DYuipcwiE,1573200,1574559,players prepared the poison for the
u6DYuipcwiE,1574559,1576640,older sister and tomohiro mockingly
u6DYuipcwiE,1576640,1577919,tells her she should have confessed
u6DYuipcwiE,1577919,1579360,earlier if she didn't want so many
u6DYuipcwiE,1579360,1581679,people to die angry the girl gets up to
u6DYuipcwiE,1581679,1583840,reveal that this is her and tomohiro's
u6DYuipcwiE,1583840,1585760,second werewolf game that's how she knew
u6DYuipcwiE,1585760,1587600,so much about the seer role because even
u6DYuipcwiE,1587600,1589200,though they won the last game they've
u6DYuipcwiE,1589200,1591120,been forced to play again knowing she'll
u6DYuipcwiE,1591120,1592799,die soon the girl comforts her little
u6DYuipcwiE,1592799,1594960,sister and it's a heartbreaking moment
u6DYuipcwiE,1594960,1597039,but that's when tomohiro here suddenly
u6DYuipcwiE,1597039,1598799,accuses the younger sister konomi of
u6DYuipcwiE,1598799,1600799,being a werewolf he makes the case that
u6DYuipcwiE,1600799,1602400,the only reason she's sacrificing
u6DYuipcwiE,1602400,1604400,herself is to hide her sister's identity
u6DYuipcwiE,1604400,1606159,and help her win the game as the last
u6DYuipcwiE,1606159,1608240,wolf the older sister tells him he's
u6DYuipcwiE,1608240,1609840,lying but the kid makes a compelling
u6DYuipcwiE,1609840,1611520,point and the others start to believe
u6DYuipcwiE,1611520,1613200,him irie brings the bottle of poison
u6DYuipcwiE,1613200,1614720,over to the werewolf but the little
u6DYuipcwiE,1614720,1616320,sister throws it across the room in
u6DYuipcwiE,1616320,1618159,anger the villager has to slap the girl
u6DYuipcwiE,1618159,1620159,to calm down and ivy reminds her they
u6DYuipcwiE,1620159,1622159,have to kill her big sister if they all
u6DYuipcwiE,1622159,1624640,want to survive freaking out she attacks
u6DYuipcwiE,1624640,1626320,the villager and has to be held down to
u6DYuipcwiE,1626320,1628240,the floor stopping konomi from saving
u6DYuipcwiE,1628240,1630159,her sister all she can do is watch as
u6DYuipcwiE,1630159,1632400,tomohiro stands over marie and splashes
u6DYuipcwiE,1632400,1634559,poison all over her face the next
u6DYuipcwiE,1634559,1636240,morning the players wake up to find that
u6DYuipcwiE,1636240,1638320,takeshi is the next player to be killed
u6DYuipcwiE,1638320,1640399,and tomohiro's face is covered in
u6DYuipcwiE,1640399,1642240,bruises it's clear that he killed a
u6DYuipcwiE,1642240,1643760,pretty boy last night who must have put
u6DYuipcwiE,1643760,1645679,up a fight and the villager asks why he
u6DYuipcwiE,1645679,1647679,didn't use the gun feeling guilty the
u6DYuipcwiE,1647679,1649760,boy bursts into tears and apologizes to
u6DYuipcwiE,1649760,1651600,the younger sister for accusing her of
u6DYuipcwiE,1651600,1653600,being a wolf later they go to the
u6DYuipcwiE,1653600,1654880,building's entrance and push the
u6DYuipcwiE,1654880,1657200,werewolf outside fully intent on letting
u6DYuipcwiE,1657200,1659200,him get killed by the device in his neck
u6DYuipcwiE,1659200,1661039,the villager watches the boy go into a
u6DYuipcwiE,1661039,1663120,full sprint as he leaves the complex and
u6DYuipcwiE,1663120,1665039,pass the gates but he only makes it so
u6DYuipcwiE,1665039,1666960,far before his device activates and the
u6DYuipcwiE,1666960,1669120,boy finally dies from blood loss but
u6DYuipcwiE,1669120,1671520,this is only the end of the first round
u6DYuipcwiE,1671520,1673039,it's the most depressing news you could
u6DYuipcwiE,1673039,1674720,ask for and the girls wash the blood off
u6DYuipcwiE,1674720,1676159,their clothing as they prepare for
u6DYuipcwiE,1676159,1678240,what's to come some time later the
u6DYuipcwiE,1678240,1680000,villagers woken up when a new batch of
u6DYuipcwiE,1680000,1682480,players pass by checking her pocket she
u6DYuipcwiE,1682480,1684159,discovers that this time she and the
u6DYuipcwiE,1684159,1686399,little sister are both werewolves
u6DYuipcwiE,1686399,1688159,hearted by her trauma the new wolf
u6DYuipcwiE,1688159,1689760,enters the voting room and prepares to
u6DYuipcwiE,1689760,1691200,show them that she's finally ready to
u6DYuipcwiE,1691200,1693120,play but what do you think how would you
