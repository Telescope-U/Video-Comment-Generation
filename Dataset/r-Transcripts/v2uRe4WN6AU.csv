v2uRe4WN6AU,0,1839,there are so many teas out there but
v2uRe4WN6AU,1839,4319,none of them look right on my body so i
v2uRe4WN6AU,4319,6640,set out to design the perfect one for me
v2uRe4WN6AU,6640,8400,it all starts with the right shape i
v2uRe4WN6AU,8400,10320,find that a lot of basic women's tees
v2uRe4WN6AU,10320,12000,are shaped like a triangle too fitted
v2uRe4WN6AU,12000,14400,too long i wanted ours boxy and cropped
v2uRe4WN6AU,14400,16400,i find that dropped shoulders are the
v2uRe4WN6AU,16400,18480,most flattering i needed the fabric to
v2uRe4WN6AU,18480,20880,drape and move with you and not be so
v2uRe4WN6AU,20880,23519,stiff and constricting there's so much
v2uRe4WN6AU,23519,25359,beauty in the simplicity of a tee but i
v2uRe4WN6AU,25359,27680,didn't want ours to be boring so i added
v2uRe4WN6AU,27680,31119,a rolled cuff i also added a curved hem
v2uRe4WN6AU,31119,34000,to add more shape to your body plus a
v2uRe4WN6AU,34000,36480,fun flat locked stitch detail down the
v2uRe4WN6AU,36480,39360,back and this is how it turned out oh my
v2uRe4WN6AU,39360,42879,gosh look how it drapes ugh it is so
v2uRe4WN6AU,42879,45120,effortless but so stylish all at the
v2uRe4WN6AU,45120,48879,same time you guys it is so soft so
v2uRe4WN6AU,48879,51199,stretchy it's perfect for working out or
v2uRe4WN6AU,51199,53280,going out seriously you guys i think
v2uRe4WN6AU,53280,54719,this is the perfect tee what do you
