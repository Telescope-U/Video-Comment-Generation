c3BVYe3uGEE,0,2268,"Yes, I'd like one of your Chum Sticks."
c3BVYe3uGEE,2401,3703,"You're kidding, right?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,3836,5003,"No, I'm serious."
c3BVYe3uGEE,5137,6138,I want a Chump Stick.
c3BVYe3uGEE,6272,9142,"Uh, okay. If you insist."
c3BVYe3uGEE,10910,12878,Oh no! Please don't sue me!
c3BVYe3uGEE,13012,15415,Mmm mmm.
c3BVYe3uGEE,17216,20920,I can't believe someone actually enjoys my chum.
c3BVYe3uGEE,21521,24924,"Now, this was so good, I'm gonna have to come back tomorrow."
c3BVYe3uGEE,25191,27260,Here you go. See you in the morning.
c3BVYe3uGEE,27393,28695,Did you see that?
c3BVYe3uGEE,28828,30897,I didn't even have to threaten his life.
c3BVYe3uGEE,31030,31998,He loved it!
c3BVYe3uGEE,32131,33500,"Here you go, sir."
c3BVYe3uGEE,33633,36436,"A king size, Ultra Krabby Supreme with the works,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,36569,39872,"Double Batter Fried, on a stick."
c3BVYe3uGEE,40006,42241,- Thanks. - Barnacle Head.
c3BVYe3uGEE,42374,45278,- Pardon me? - You forgot your mayonnaise.
c3BVYe3uGEE,45545,46678,Thanks.
c3BVYe3uGEE,46813,50183,Hello gentlemen! And welcome to the Chum Bucket.
c3BVYe3uGEE,50316,52585,Would you like seating inside or outside?
c3BVYe3uGEE,52718,53586,Seating for what?
c3BVYe3uGEE,53720,55221,For the Chum Bucket!
c3BVYe3uGEE,55354,57624,Where you can enjoy a nice helping chum.
c3BVYe3uGEE,57757,64664,"Oh boy, this is so, mmm mmm, good."
c3BVYe3uGEE,64796,65731,The chum is.
c3BVYe3uGEE,65865,67266,Wait a minute. Eating chum.
c3BVYe3uGEE,67399,68834,Do people do that?
c3BVYe3uGEE,68968,71470,"No, I'm talking about the sound of a hungry customer."
c3BVYe3uGEE,71604,73639,He doesn't want to eat us for being lazy.
c3BVYe3uGEE,73773,76141,He wants to eat us because he's hungry.
c3BVYe3uGEE,76275,78144,"Fellas, leave this to me."
c3BVYe3uGEE,91257,92658,"Step right up, gents!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,92792,95361,"Get a delicious Chum Burger, right here."
c3BVYe3uGEE,95495,98064,Big Johnny will eat anything.
c3BVYe3uGEE,98497,101334,"Have a Chum Burger, Johnny, sir."
c3BVYe3uGEE,102535,106139,"Go on, sir. Tell your buddies what you think."
c3BVYe3uGEE,108774,111177,I'm gonna try one of rag boy's burgers.
c3BVYe3uGEE,111877,113479,"Here you are, sir."
c3BVYe3uGEE,113713,116616,You are the first to taste a Krabby Patty.
c3BVYe3uGEE,120253,121888,Flavor!
c3BVYe3uGEE,122688,123489,Edible!
c3BVYe3uGEE,123623,125825,We can actually hold it down!
c3BVYe3uGEE,125958,128361,This is the most flavor-tastic sensation
c3BVYe3uGEE,128494,131698,my still developing tastebuds have ever experienced!
c3BVYe3uGEE,131831,135700,[cheering]
c3BVYe3uGEE,135834,139271,"Wait, Squidward! You can't throw out a Krabby Patty."
c3BVYe3uGEE,139405,140773,That is just wrong.
c3BVYe3uGEE,140907,142308,But this one is rotten.
c3BVYe3uGEE,142441,143776,"[indiscernible], Squidward."
c3BVYe3uGEE,143909,146679,No Krabby Patty can ever truly be rotten.
c3BVYe3uGEE,146812,147814,"Here, look."
c3BVYe3uGEE,149582,151217,Gah!
c3BVYe3uGEE,159492,161494,"Oh, that looks delicious."
c3BVYe3uGEE,161627,164597,Why don't you take another bite?
c3BVYe3uGEE,171370,172939,[screaming]
c3BVYe3uGEE,173072,175541,"You know, this stuff is hideously inedible."
c3BVYe3uGEE,175675,177143,"But your decor is so amazing,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,177277,178944,I can resist spending my money here.
c3BVYe3uGEE,179078,180780,[screaming]
c3BVYe3uGEE,183282,184984,"Two orders of Chum Nuggets, please."
c3BVYe3uGEE,185117,186519,[screaming]
c3BVYe3uGEE,189288,190657,That certainly is chum.
c3BVYe3uGEE,190790,193491,And such steamy chumminess deserves recompense.
c3BVYe3uGEE,193626,195328,"Oh, I'll take that."
c3BVYe3uGEE,195461,197530,"Eat your twisted, blackened,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,197663,199631,"money grubbing, heart out, Krabs."
c3BVYe3uGEE,199766,203403,I'm even profiting off your most loyal ally.
c3BVYe3uGEE,206739,208841,I'm running out of space for this stuff.
c3BVYe3uGEE,208975,212178,"Got an empty safe I can borrow, Krabs?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,212311,213946,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,214080,216816,"But seriously, this is getting really heavy."
c3BVYe3uGEE,224590,226859,"Patrick, isn't this place amazing?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,226992,230997,[mumbling]
c3BVYe3uGEE,231497,232898,"Here's your Chum Nuggets, buddy."
c3BVYe3uGEE,233399,237904,Oh. I almost forgot. Your Chum Kabob.
c3BVYe3uGEE,238037,239438,Um...
c3BVYe3uGEE,239571,241273,I guess you don't come down here for the food anyway.
c3BVYe3uGEE,241406,242941,You come down here
c3BVYe3uGEE,243075,246178,to admire the subterranean splendor of the Chum Caverns.
c3BVYe3uGEE,246312,247713,That and the gift shop.
c3BVYe3uGEE,247847,249314,"Ooh, that's right, Patrick!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,249448,250750,The gift shop!
c3BVYe3uGEE,262628,264462,Where's the love?
c3BVYe3uGEE,264596,267066,SpongeBob! What happened to the Krabby Patties?
c3BVYe3uGEE,267200,272338,"I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,272871,274974,This is obscene.
c3BVYe3uGEE,275107,278242,"Uhh, pee-ew!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,278377,280579,What's that awful stench?
c3BVYe3uGEE,280713,283916,"You're not boiling your underpants again, are you?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,284049,285551,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,285684,288987,I told you to turn off that laugh track.
c3BVYe3uGEE,289121,291424,"If you must know, I made sauce."
c3BVYe3uGEE,291557,294894,"But, when I add Patrick's DNA to it,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,295028,297763,it will become salsa imbecilicus.
c3BVYe3uGEE,297897,298464,Uh.
c3BVYe3uGEE,298597,300198,Idiot sauce!
c3BVYe3uGEE,300332,301867,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,302001,303969,"I'll serve it to Krabs, and it'll make him so dumb,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,304103,306072,he'll just give me the secret formula!
c3BVYe3uGEE,306205,307405,Huh? Huh?
c3BVYe3uGEE,307539,309776,I think I prefer the boiling underpants.
c3BVYe3uGEE,309909,311611,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,311744,313379,It's just a little old Krabby Patty
c3BVYe3uGEE,313513,315448,smothered in jellyfish jelly.
c3BVYe3uGEE,315581,319352,I call it a Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly.
c3BVYe3uGEE,319485,321754,- Could I try some? - Sure.
c3BVYe3uGEE,325958,327493,Amazing.

c3BVYe3uGEE,370703,372171,"Well, all this waiting around"
c3BVYe3uGEE,372304,375007,for someone to get mauled is making me a bit hungry.

c3BVYe3uGEE,379544,380479,"Why, thank you."
c3BVYe3uGEE,380613,382214,"Just ten dollars, please."
c3BVYe3uGEE,382347,383882,Ten dollars?
c3BVYe3uGEE,384016,385784,Why would I pay ten dollars when I can go across the street
c3BVYe3uGEE,385918,388020,and get a Krabby Patty for one dollar?
c3BVYe3uGEE,388154,389689,Exactly!
c3BVYe3uGEE,390089,391090,Ugh!
c3BVYe3uGEE,391223,392591,You don't get this kind of entertainment
c3BVYe3uGEE,392724,394426,"with a Krabby Patty, do you?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,394559,396462,"No, I suppose not."
c3BVYe3uGEE,396596,398764,Ten dollars or the fights off!
c3BVYe3uGEE,399131,400933,Fine! Whatever!

c3BVYe3uGEE,412377,414080,"Oh, just the usual ingredients."
c3BVYe3uGEE,414213,416749,"Some jellyfish squeezing, whale blubber,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,416882,420819,"seahorse snout, and a sprinkle of anchor rust."
c3BVYe3uGEE,421020,422888,[coughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,423021,424357,[vomitting]
c3BVYe3uGEE,424490,426959,Oh barnacles! That's foul!
c3BVYe3uGEE,427092,429228,[grumbling]
c3BVYe3uGEE,429361,431996,"Oh. Nope, I was wrong."
c3BVYe3uGEE,432131,433365,It looks okay.
c3BVYe3uGEE,433499,436202,Sure is a fine looking pizza.
c3BVYe3uGEE,436335,437436,Yeah.
c3BVYe3uGEE,437569,438370,What's that?
c3BVYe3uGEE,438504,440473,Is that the cheese?
c3BVYe3uGEE,440606,441473,Yeah.
c3BVYe3uGEE,441606,443776,And the pepperoni.
c3BVYe3uGEE,443909,444977,Yeah.
c3BVYe3uGEE,445111,447613,"Oh, looks good, huh?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,449548,452919,[vomitting]
c3BVYe3uGEE,454887,458724,Here's your Chum Bucket Supreme! Enjoy.
c3BVYe3uGEE,458858,461927,"Patrick, my boy, you really earned that promotion."
c3BVYe3uGEE,462061,463028,"Thanks, boss!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,463162,465664,"If that imposter wants a Krabby Patty,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,465798,469801,"then by Neptune, we'll give him one."
c3BVYe3uGEE,470569,473505,"You're dancing with the Krab Man, now."
c3BVYe3uGEE,473639,475307,"Join me, boy, or you're fired."
c3BVYe3uGEE,475440,477142,It doesn't seem right.
c3BVYe3uGEE,477576,479845,But it feels so good!
c3BVYe3uGEE,479979,483248,"Seahorseradish, the gnarliest stuff in the ocean."
c3BVYe3uGEE,483382,487185,Ooh! Hold on. I've got a jar of toenail clippings in my office.
c3BVYe3uGEE,487619,489955,Oops. I dropped it in the toilet!
c3BVYe3uGEE,490088,493726,Well fish it out and I'll dry it with me gym socks!
c3BVYe3uGEE,494026,495394,[whimpering]
c3BVYe3uGEE,495527,501500,"Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned."
c3BVYe3uGEE,501634,505371,I call it the Nasty Patty.
c3BVYe3uGEE,505504,507306,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,507440,509808,Hey! Hurry up with that Patty.
c3BVYe3uGEE,509942,511409,"Here you are, sir. Enjoy."
c3BVYe3uGEE,511844,516214,Ah. Hello delicious. Come to Papa.
c3BVYe3uGEE,516715,520352,[gagging]
c3BVYe3uGEE,520485,522354,Listen. He ate it.
c3BVYe3uGEE,522487,524223,"Oh, look at him choke!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,524356,526024,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,526625,528027,Look at him suffer.
c3BVYe3uGEE,528160,529495,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,529628,532164,[gagging]
c3BVYe3uGEE,532297,534000,"Did you see that, boy?"
c3BVYe3uGEE,534133,534900,[laughing]
c3BVYe3uGEE,535034,538237,"Oh man, that look on his face."
c3BVYe3uGEE,538370,542308,[gagging]
c3BVYe3uGEE,543709,545411,[groaning]
c3BVYe3uGEE,545544,546578,[snoring]
c3BVYe3uGEE,546712,548246,Who took my blue blankie?
c3BVYe3uGEE,548381,551250,Huh. This is the secret stuff.
c3BVYe3uGEE,551650,553785,Doesn't look very promising.
c3BVYe3uGEE,553919,555755,"Oh, just taste it already."
c3BVYe3uGEE,557189,559759,"Well, the smell doesn't make me wretch."
c3BVYe3uGEE,562594,565264,"Hey, that ain't bad at all."
c3BVYe3uGEE,566932,569702,It's actually amazing!
c3BVYe3uGEE,573973,576909,This is gold in the form of chum!
c3BVYe3uGEE,578310,579878,"Squidward, my friend,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,580112,582848,you'll be the toast of Bikini Bottom.
c3BVYe3uGEE,582981,586918,This recipe is going to make you a star.
c3BVYe3uGEE,587052,590656,A star.
c3BVYe3uGEE,590789,594126,"Back for more of my delicious chum, I see."
c3BVYe3uGEE,594260,595560,Not this time.
c3BVYe3uGEE,595694,596561,Huh?
c3BVYe3uGEE,596695,598431,Not ever again!
c3BVYe3uGEE,598564,601933,The deal's off computer! I can't eat another bite of that slop!
c3BVYe3uGEE,602067,603469,No matter how much you pay me!
c3BVYe3uGEE,603602,605037,[mumbling] Huh?
c3BVYe3uGEE,605170,606972,"I have eaten ten of those things,"
c3BVYe3uGEE,607106,609041,and I've already had to go to the doctor.
c3BVYe3uGEE,609174,610276,Twice!
c3BVYe3uGEE,610409,617816,[groaning]
c3BVYe3uGEE,618083,622321,"If you need me, I'll be getting my stomach pumped, again."
c3BVYe3uGEE,622454,624857,[groaning]
c3BVYe3uGEE,624990,626157,Should've known!
c3BVYe3uGEE,626291,629428,Why would anyone ever eat my slop?
c3BVYe3uGEE,629862,631430,Ugh! There he goes again.
c3BVYe3uGEE,631563,632964,"Cut it out, Plankton!"
c3BVYe3uGEE,633098,636568,What? It's just obvious that I'm a complete failure
c3BVYe3uGEE,636702,639171,and a waste of a lower life form.
c3BVYe3uGEE,639305,641206,Oh woe is me!
c3BVYe3uGEE,641340,642408,[crying]
c3BVYe3uGEE,642541,645210,Quickly. Now is the time to beat a hasty retreat.
c3BVYe3uGEE,645344,646912,What? And miss this?
c3BVYe3uGEE,647146,649080,I never enjoyed me some more.
c3BVYe3uGEE,649347,651217,This irony's pretty good stuff.
c3BVYe3uGEE,651350,652985,[laughing]
