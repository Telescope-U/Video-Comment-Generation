bVm6zOI6a3A,72080,73600,expert guidance we're going to see how
bVm6zOI6a3A,73600,75280,you do on a few laps and see if we can
bVm6zOI6a3A,75280,76799,improve them using some splunk
bVm6zOI6a3A,76799,79360,dashboards three laps around silverstone
bVm6zOI6a3A,79360,81119,let's see what you got okay i'll give it
bVm6zOI6a3A,81119,83280,my best this one's flat isn't it yeah

bVm6zOI6a3A,84799,86560,to the right beauty
bVm6zOI6a3A,86560,89520,thank you piss or sick
bVm6zOI6a3A,89520,91439,you should be a driver mate

bVm6zOI6a3A,93680,96159,or exit or exit
bVm6zOI6a3A,96159,100159,well faster slap will josie
bVm6zOI6a3A,100159,102000,tell us a little bit about what type of
bVm6zOI6a3A,102000,104320,data you're looking for so with splunk
bVm6zOI6a3A,104320,106159,we have a dashboard and therefore we can
bVm6zOI6a3A,106159,107600,look at all of these vital bits of
bVm6zOI6a3A,107600,109520,information uh and the crucial things
bVm6zOI6a3A,109520,111119,which will help us go quick so i think
bVm6zOI6a3A,111119,112560,the simple channels we're gonna use here
bVm6zOI6a3A,112560,115840,for me are throttle brake and the gears
bVm6zOI6a3A,115840,118640,as you can see very jumpy very up and
bVm6zOI6a3A,118640,120960,down not quite like your one no not as
bVm6zOI6a3A,120960,122640,beautiful as mine so you're a bit
bVm6zOI6a3A,122640,124960,indecisive with things you come on
bVm6zOI6a3A,124960,127040,you're off you're a bit too much forward
bVm6zOI6a3A,127040,128959,and back so be a bit more patient in the
bVm6zOI6a3A,128959,130879,middle of the corner wait till you know

bVm6zOI6a3A,180800,182720,will how'd you find it today honestly
bVm6zOI6a3A,182720,184159,really difficult but with lando's

bVm6zOI6a3A,191040,193280,with his engineer tom so um they have no
bVm6zOI6a3A,193280,194879,chance all right let's go and take a
bVm6zOI6a3A,194879,196480,look see what happens

bVm6zOI6a3A,202400,204720,tom's really zoned in right now tom
bVm6zOI6a3A,204720,206959,being daniel's race engineer this is a
bVm6zOI6a3A,206959,208879,new position for you it's really hard
bVm6zOI6a3A,208879,211040,driving and talking three laps right
bVm6zOI6a3A,211040,212400,let's see what you can do
bVm6zOI6a3A,212400,214879,yeah we got this tom all right all right
bVm6zOI6a3A,214879,216879,let's go baby
bVm6zOI6a3A,216879,218480,don't forget to break
bVm6zOI6a3A,218480,220480,nice good exit
bVm6zOI6a3A,220480,223680,send it nice scenario
bVm6zOI6a3A,223680,224799,two
bVm6zOI6a3A,224799,226879,recharge off
bVm6zOI6a3A,226879,229120,great start three laps in so what are we
bVm6zOI6a3A,229120,230799,looking for here what are we reading so
bVm6zOI6a3A,230799,232720,we're trying to look at obviously up to
bVm6zOI6a3A,232720,234319,lap i'd like to say trying different
bVm6zOI6a3A,234319,236080,things but probably flattering myself to
bVm6zOI6a3A,236080,237599,say that whereas when we look at
bVm6zOI6a3A,237599,239439,daniel's data every lapse like super
bVm6zOI6a3A,239439,240959,consistent and we're really in really
bVm6zOI6a3A,240959,242720,small differences so
bVm6zOI6a3A,242720,245120,dr what can i do better i think turn
bVm6zOI6a3A,245120,247840,four was a bit of a problem corner i
bVm6zOI6a3A,247840,249920,think commit to stay out longer a little
bVm6zOI6a3A,249920,252000,bit stay out wider a little longer and
bVm6zOI6a3A,252000,253360,then cut back and you'll get a much
bVm6zOI6a3A,253360,255040,better exit and then that takes you down
bVm6zOI6a3A,255040,257519,towards what's at turn six well why
bVm6zOI6a3A,257519,259600,don't we um get back in the sim and see
bVm6zOI6a3A,259600,261199,what we can do for the next three laps
bVm6zOI6a3A,261199,263520,and hopefully beat lando and will let's
bVm6zOI6a3A,263520,265840,do it
bVm6zOI6a3A,266000,267600,that's what we've got that's all there
bVm6zOI6a3A,267600,269680,is
bVm6zOI6a3A,269680,272240,this one titans remember
bVm6zOI6a3A,272240,274000,yeah that's right
bVm6zOI6a3A,274000,276160,get a nice exit
bVm6zOI6a3A,276160,278880,and these progressively get tighter nice
bVm6zOI6a3A,278880,280840,and
bVm6zOI6a3A,280840,284240,steady you can break at like the 50
bVm6zOI6a3A,284240,287199,see it's quite deep into the corner yeah
bVm6zOI6a3A,287199,288960,that was really nice
bVm6zOI6a3A,288960,290880,starting to get the hang of it here flat
bVm6zOI6a3A,290880,294240,out baby that's a big lap 33 8.
bVm6zOI6a3A,294240,296960,you're just taking two seconds off
bVm6zOI6a3A,296960,299759,2.8 seconds off
bVm6zOI6a3A,299759,301600,tom how important is data across
bVm6zOI6a3A,301600,304639,real-life racing and esports the level
bVm6zOI6a3A,304639,306880,of accuracy that these guys can achieve
bVm6zOI6a3A,306880,308720,is phenomenal mary is just the way my
bVm6zOI6a3A,308720,310479,mind works but looking at the data kind
bVm6zOI6a3A,310479,312560,of helped me i could see a lot of the
