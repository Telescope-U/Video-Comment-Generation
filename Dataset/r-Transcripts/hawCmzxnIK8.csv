hawCmzxnIK8,80,2000,all of the benchmarks for apple's brand
hawCmzxnIK8,2000,5200,new m2 chip have just leaked all over
hawCmzxnIK8,5200,6560,the internet we're talking about
hawCmzxnIK8,6560,9519,geekbench cinebench gfx bench we got the
hawCmzxnIK8,9519,11920,graphics everything included all of it
hawCmzxnIK8,11920,14960,leaked this morning and to be honest i'm
hawCmzxnIK8,14960,17600,actually surprised and impressed by the
hawCmzxnIK8,17600,20240,performance because it's beating out
hawCmzxnIK8,20240,22960,apple's own claims so with that said
hawCmzxnIK8,22960,25519,let's jump right into the leaks first
hawCmzxnIK8,25519,27359,off here's the headline report from mac
hawCmzxnIK8,27359,30080,rumors leaked benchmarks confirm m2 chip
hawCmzxnIK8,30080,33200,is up to 20 faster than the m1 and
hawCmzxnIK8,33200,34960,surprisingly i was actually the first
hawCmzxnIK8,34960,37200,one to show this off on twitter this
hawCmzxnIK8,37200,39920,morning thanks to amos but before we get
hawCmzxnIK8,39920,41760,into these leaked benchmarks i want to
hawCmzxnIK8,41760,44239,mention that according to apple the m2
hawCmzxnIK8,44239,47520,chip should be 18 faster in terms of
hawCmzxnIK8,47520,50160,multi-core performance so just remember
hawCmzxnIK8,50160,53280,that because these leaks are impressive
hawCmzxnIK8,53280,55199,and here it is the first benchmark leak
hawCmzxnIK8,55199,57960,for the m2 chip we have
hawCmzxnIK8,57960,62199,1919 points for single core and 8
hawCmzxnIK8,62199,64799,928 points for multi-core which is
hawCmzxnIK8,64799,66880,better than i personally estimated
hawCmzxnIK8,66880,69200,around five months ago when i made the
hawCmzxnIK8,69200,72320,m2 performance estimation video but
hawCmzxnIK8,72320,73840,before i show you guys just how much
hawCmzxnIK8,73840,76720,faster that is compared to the m1 chip i
hawCmzxnIK8,76720,78240,want to go down into the system
hawCmzxnIK8,78240,81040,information and point out the base
hawCmzxnIK8,81040,84400,frequency we have 3.49
hawCmzxnIK8,84400,86720,gigahertz which is actually quite a bit
hawCmzxnIK8,86720,89360,faster than the previous m1 which was
hawCmzxnIK8,89360,92400,sitting at 3.2 gigahertz so that means
hawCmzxnIK8,92400,94159,the clock speeds are sitting at around
hawCmzxnIK8,94159,95600,11
hawCmzxnIK8,95600,98720,higher than the m2 chip and keep in mind
hawCmzxnIK8,98720,100479,that this model does have
hawCmzxnIK8,100479,103920,the 16 gigs of ram so it's not 24 which
hawCmzxnIK8,103920,107200,the 24 model could actually score higher
hawCmzxnIK8,107200,108960,than this but going over to the
hawCmzxnIK8,108960,110880,geekbench browser we can see that the
hawCmzxnIK8,110880,116039,best score for the m1 ship was 1720
hawCmzxnIK8,116159,118560,in terms of single core and in terms of
hawCmzxnIK8,118560,121040,the multi-core we got
hawCmzxnIK8,121040,124040,7474
hawCmzxnIK8,125520,127520,in terms of the multi-core so that
hawCmzxnIK8,127520,130039,basically translates over to
hawCmzxnIK8,130039,133120,11.56 percent better for the single core
hawCmzxnIK8,133120,135200,performance as you can see in this chart
hawCmzxnIK8,135200,138760,and then 19.45
hawCmzxnIK8,138879,140560,better performance in terms of the
hawCmzxnIK8,140560,142879,multi-core which is better than my
hawCmzxnIK8,142879,144640,estimates because i personally estimated
hawCmzxnIK8,144640,148319,around 9.3 for single core and then 18
hawCmzxnIK8,148319,150239,for the multi-core so it seems like it's
hawCmzxnIK8,150239,152959,doing better than apple showed off or
hawCmzxnIK8,152959,155120,claimed and if you're wondering just how
hawCmzxnIK8,155120,157680,fast that number is in terms of the
hawCmzxnIK8,157680,159560,single core performance
hawCmzxnIK8,159560,162959,1919 keep in mind that the best
hawCmzxnIK8,162959,165680,mainstream consumer chip from intel
hawCmzxnIK8,165680,170080,their i9 12 900k and the kf they are the
hawCmzxnIK8,170080,172959,only ones that scored better than this
hawCmzxnIK8,172959,177519,brand new low power usage consumer level
hawCmzxnIK8,177519,181440,m2 chip look at that 1947 in 1990
hawCmzxnIK8,181440,185200,compared to 1919 but wait it gets better
hawCmzxnIK8,185200,187040,because there was another leak score
hawCmzxnIK8,187040,188640,1927
hawCmzxnIK8,188640,191519,even better for the m2 chip now i know a
hawCmzxnIK8,191519,192640,lot of you guys are going to say that
hawCmzxnIK8,192640,194080,it's geekbench and it doesn't really
hawCmzxnIK8,194080,196400,show the real world performance or the
hawCmzxnIK8,196400,199200,performance under an actual workload
hawCmzxnIK8,199200,202159,well thankfully the cinema scores leaked
hawCmzxnIK8,202159,204720,as well as you can see right here in
hawCmzxnIK8,204720,206239,terms of the single core we have a
hawCmzxnIK8,206239,208720,thousand seven hundred and thirty eight
hawCmzxnIK8,208720,211560,compared to eight thousand seven hundred
hawCmzxnIK8,211560,215200,794 for the actual multi-thread or
hawCmzxnIK8,215200,217920,multi-core in cinebench which basically
hawCmzxnIK8,217920,220239,makes the single core thread performance
hawCmzxnIK8,220239,222480,13.5
hawCmzxnIK8,222480,225200,faster which is actually very very
hawCmzxnIK8,225200,227440,impressive however the multi-core is
hawCmzxnIK8,227440,229599,only 11.6
hawCmzxnIK8,229599,232239,faster than the m1 chip in terms of
hawCmzxnIK8,232239,234720,cinebench r23 which is a little bit
hawCmzxnIK8,234720,236799,disappointing but keep in mind that
hawCmzxnIK8,236799,239599,cinebench is still not fully optimized
hawCmzxnIK8,239599,242159,for apple silicon yes it runs on metal
hawCmzxnIK8,242159,244319,they got it to work on metal instead of
hawCmzxnIK8,244319,246560,actually working through rosetta but it
hawCmzxnIK8,246560,249519,still uses ombre i think it's called so
hawCmzxnIK8,249519,252799,it's still kind of tuned for x86 chips
hawCmzxnIK8,252799,255599,and not for apple silicon but now with
hawCmzxnIK8,255599,257440,that said let's move over to the
hawCmzxnIK8,257440,259600,graphics performance which apple says
hawCmzxnIK8,259600,262400,the m2 chip is 35
hawCmzxnIK8,262400,265280,faster than the m1 but you have to make
hawCmzxnIK8,265280,267840,a distinction here because the m2 chip
hawCmzxnIK8,267840,270880,actually has two more gpu cores it has
hawCmzxnIK8,270880,273919,10 instead of eight with the m1 so
hawCmzxnIK8,273919,275759,that's 25
hawCmzxnIK8,275759,278000,more cores so with that said we should
hawCmzxnIK8,278000,281040,have expected 25 extra performance right
hawCmzxnIK8,281040,283280,out of the gate but apple is showing off
hawCmzxnIK8,283280,286240,35 percent which means around 10 more
hawCmzxnIK8,286240,288880,from the actual ipc improvements
hawCmzxnIK8,288880,291120,themselves which i thought was a little
hawCmzxnIK8,291120,294320,bit disappointing but check out these
hawCmzxnIK8,294320,298400,new gpu leaks in geekbench metal 29
hawCmzxnIK8,298400,300800,832
hawCmzxnIK8,300800,302479,which is actually higher than my initial
hawCmzxnIK8,302479,304759,estimate five months ago with 28
hawCmzxnIK8,304759,307680,874 which basically makes the
hawCmzxnIK8,307680,310960,performance improvement 41
hawCmzxnIK8,310960,314240,faster with the m2 compared to the m1
hawCmzxnIK8,314240,316800,which is actually pretty good but wait
hawCmzxnIK8,316800,319039,it gets even better than that because on
hawCmzxnIK8,319039,321919,wcf tech they actually found another
hawCmzxnIK8,321919,323840,leak for the gpu performance which is
hawCmzxnIK8,323840,326720,even better 30
hawCmzxnIK8,326720,329039,627
hawCmzxnIK8,329039,333440,points with the new m2 10 core gpu that
hawCmzxnIK8,333440,335680,basically means that with this new leak
hawCmzxnIK8,335680,339280,score the m2 is now 45
hawCmzxnIK8,339280,342720,faster than the m1 and that is what i
hawCmzxnIK8,342720,345039,call an impressive improvement but keep
hawCmzxnIK8,345039,347039,in mind that's the 10 core version
hawCmzxnIK8,347039,350320,within the m2 macbook pro with the fan
hawCmzxnIK8,350320,352560,so likely the macbook air is going to be
hawCmzxnIK8,352560,354320,quite a bit slower in terms of the 10
hawCmzxnIK8,354320,356720,core because of throttling maybe it
hawCmzxnIK8,356720,358560,might be around i don't know a few
hawCmzxnIK8,358560,361280,percentage points slower than that and
hawCmzxnIK8,361280,362880,also you have to keep in mind that the
hawCmzxnIK8,362880,365039,macbook air is going to come with the 8
hawCmzxnIK8,365039,368240,core gpu at the base price so if we
hawCmzxnIK8,368240,370000,consider the performance of the 8 core
hawCmzxnIK8,370000,372880,it should be around 25
hawCmzxnIK8,372880,375360,400 which is still a pretty impressive
hawCmzxnIK8,375360,378479,improvement compared to the 21 000 that
hawCmzxnIK8,378479,380639,you get with the m1 and once again i
hawCmzxnIK8,380639,381840,know a lot of you guys don't like
hawCmzxnIK8,381840,383600,geekbench especially in terms of the
hawCmzxnIK8,383600,386560,metal performance so thankfully we also
hawCmzxnIK8,386560,390560,got some leaks with gfx bench as well as
hawCmzxnIK8,390560,392080,you can see right here we have some new
hawCmzxnIK8,392080,394880,scores for the m2 chip and i've put up a
hawCmzxnIK8,394880,398160,comparison with the m1 now in aztec
hawCmzxnIK8,398160,400759,ruins normal tier we have
hawCmzxnIK8,400759,406160,295.6 fps compared to 203 fps with the
hawCmzxnIK8,406160,407880,m1 which is
hawCmzxnIK8,407880,411599,45.6 faster which almost perfectly
hawCmzxnIK8,411599,413360,matches the score that we got with
hawCmzxnIK8,413360,416319,geekbench so this is pretty reliable and
hawCmzxnIK8,416319,418639,i'm actually excited because i was not
hawCmzxnIK8,418639,420960,expecting that much of a performance
hawCmzxnIK8,420960,423440,improvement now moving on to aztec ruins
hawCmzxnIK8,423440,427840,high tier 109.9 fps compared to 77.4
hawCmzxnIK8,427840,431280,which is 42 faster than the 1440p
hawCmzxnIK8,431280,434400,manhattan 3.1.1
hawCmzxnIK8,434400,438479,off screen 175.8 compared to 122.3
hawCmzxnIK8,438479,439560,which is
hawCmzxnIK8,439560,441199,43.7
hawCmzxnIK8,441199,443759,faster so it's staying pretty consistent
hawCmzxnIK8,443759,445840,but then in car chase for some reason it
hawCmzxnIK8,445840,449759,slows down 229.8 compared to 173.2
hawCmzxnIK8,449759,453680,which is only 32.7
hawCmzxnIK8,453680,457039,faster but still i'd say that this is
hawCmzxnIK8,457039,458800,pretty impressive and i like to use
hawCmzxnIK8,458800,460880,aztec ruins because i think that's the
hawCmzxnIK8,460880,463680,most reliable and the highest and test
hawCmzxnIK8,463680,465039,so wow
hawCmzxnIK8,465039,467120,there you go that is incredibly
hawCmzxnIK8,467120,469039,impressive for the gpu and i've got to
hawCmzxnIK8,469039,471280,take some of my words back because i was
hawCmzxnIK8,471280,473680,going off of apple's claims and they
hawCmzxnIK8,473680,475919,were drastically underestimating their
hawCmzxnIK8,475919,478400,own gpu so this is really good to see
hawCmzxnIK8,478400,479919,that the real
hawCmzxnIK8,479919,482400,performance leaked benchmarks are coming
hawCmzxnIK8,482400,485120,out now and confirming that it's faster
hawCmzxnIK8,485120,487840,than we expected so with that said
hawCmzxnIK8,487840,489520,hopefully you enjoy this video and if
hawCmzxnIK8,489520,490960,you did let me know your comments down

hawCmzxnIK8,497199,499280,friday and we're going to be testing
hawCmzxnIK8,499280,501440,everything with that new macbook pro so
hawCmzxnIK8,501440,502720,definitely do that and check out one of
hawCmzxnIK8,502720,504240,those two right there thanks for
