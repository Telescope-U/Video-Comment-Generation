O3OQEVpZDIE,240,2080,welcome to the gcn tech show i'm alex
O3OQEVpZDIE,2080,4080,payton and i'm oliver bridgewood and
O3OQEVpZDIE,4080,5759,we've got loads of cool stuff this week
O3OQEVpZDIE,5759,8400,including uh some things that are coming
O3OQEVpZDIE,8400,10639,out to celebrate the the big the big
O3OQEVpZDIE,10639,12160,french bike ride here that's happening
O3OQEVpZDIE,12160,14400,in july including these limited edition
O3OQEVpZDIE,14400,17199,another nice gcn yellow bottles uh
O3OQEVpZDIE,17199,19119,limited edition helmet that's that's
O3OQEVpZDIE,19119,21279,coming out too from cask a solar-powered
O3OQEVpZDIE,21279,23199,bike computer and some nice gravelly boy
O3OQEVpZDIE,23199,24720,wheels and then for our main talking
O3OQEVpZDIE,24720,26000,point this week we're going to be
O3OQEVpZDIE,26000,28080,discussing the tech and bike products
O3OQEVpZDIE,28080,30400,that we regret buying yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,30400,32160,i've got a lot of regrets
O3OQEVpZDIE,32160,36070,what about bike products them too
O3OQEVpZDIE,36070,46879,[Music]
O3OQEVpZDIE,46879,48160,first up this week let's take a look at
O3OQEVpZDIE,48160,50320,last week's poll oh we haven't pulled up
O3OQEVpZDIE,50320,52320,no poll this week because we're actually
O3OQEVpZDIE,52320,54399,pre-recording the show both of us when
O3OQEVpZDIE,54399,56160,this goes out we'll be away on our holly
O3OQEVpZDIE,56160,59600,bobs not together no
O3OQEVpZDIE,59600,61039,we're getting separate because alex is
O3OQEVpZDIE,61039,62559,on a honeymoon yeah and we didn't trust
O3OQEVpZDIE,62559,65280,hank to do the show without us there so
O3OQEVpZDIE,65280,68080,under our supervision so yeah um yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,68080,69360,pre-recorded but it means we've got two
O3OQEVpZDIE,69360,71520,poll results next week anyway this week
O3OQEVpZDIE,71520,73360,we're discussing cycling products and
O3OQEVpZDIE,73360,76159,tech which we regret buying yeah i've
O3OQEVpZDIE,76159,78320,i've got one god right
O3OQEVpZDIE,78320,80560,so this is going back a while now like
O3OQEVpZDIE,80560,84479,12 years ago i bought a turbo trainer
O3OQEVpZDIE,84479,86560,80 english pounds
O3OQEVpZDIE,86560,88799,now this back then this is before smart
O3OQEVpZDIE,88799,90240,trainers existed yeah didn't have a
O3OQEVpZDIE,90240,92159,power meter in it it was a basic wheel
O3OQEVpZDIE,92159,94799,on turbo that you just plunked your bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,94799,96240,on and the rear wheel moved against
O3OQEVpZDIE,96240,98320,thing and i bought it with the best will
O3OQEVpZDIE,98320,100079,in the world of using it to train
O3OQEVpZDIE,100079,101920,indoors when the weather was really bad
O3OQEVpZDIE,101920,104240,and and get fit in the winter yeah and i
O3OQEVpZDIE,104240,106320,think i used it twice because it was
O3OQEVpZDIE,106320,108640,horrible to use like this is before
O3OQEVpZDIE,108640,110240,you know wahoo system or zwift or
O3OQEVpZDIE,110240,112479,anything like that again like no power
O3OQEVpZDIE,112479,114320,it you changed resistance with this
O3OQEVpZDIE,114320,116719,horrible magnetic cable thing i had one
O3OQEVpZDIE,116719,118320,really similar to that it made it
O3OQEVpZDIE,118320,119759,absolutely racket when you did your
O3OQEVpZDIE,119759,121280,hardest effort yeah but then it was also
O3OQEVpZDIE,121280,122719,like just pedaling on it didn't feel
O3OQEVpZDIE,122719,124399,like riding a bike just like riding
O3OQEVpZDIE,124399,126479,through you know riding through custard
O3OQEVpZDIE,126479,128000,it was just trudging a lot it was
O3OQEVpZDIE,128000,130319,horrible yeah and and you know just that
O3OQEVpZDIE,130319,132720,and your garage wall for entertainment
O3OQEVpZDIE,132720,134959,it was just so grim well i think i used
O3OQEVpZDIE,134959,136560,it about twice and then it just sat
O3OQEVpZDIE,136560,138160,gathering dust in the corner of the
O3OQEVpZDIE,138160,140000,garage okay right it's a good start i've
O3OQEVpZDIE,140000,142720,got a great one here so products which i
O3OQEVpZDIE,142720,145520,regret buying clincher tires but a
O3OQEVpZDIE,145520,147280,tubular design so tubular clinchers i
O3OQEVpZDIE,147280,149040,guess oh there's these i know lots of
O3OQEVpZDIE,149040,150239,people probably haven't got a clue what
O3OQEVpZDIE,150239,152239,it is so this is probably what this is
O3OQEVpZDIE,152239,154400,we're going back maybe
O3OQEVpZDIE,154400,156319,15 years or so maybe even more than that
O3OQEVpZDIE,156319,158720,so this is a product the ones that i had
O3OQEVpZDIE,158720,161680,at the time were made by um twofo so it
O3OQEVpZDIE,161680,163200,was a tubular tyre but where you have
O3OQEVpZDIE,163200,164879,the base tape normally which is then
O3OQEVpZDIE,164879,167120,stuck onto the tubular rim you had a
O3OQEVpZDIE,167120,169519,sort of molded hard rubber sort of
O3OQEVpZDIE,169519,171840,plastic section which then interlocked
O3OQEVpZDIE,171840,172800,into the
O3OQEVpZDIE,172800,174879,like hook on a clincher rim
O3OQEVpZDIE,174879,177360,it was like a halfway house between
O3OQEVpZDIE,177360,179599,tubular and clincher but it meant if you
O3OQEVpZDIE,179599,180959,wanted tubular tires you could use your
O3OQEVpZDIE,180959,182480,cleans your rims
O3OQEVpZDIE,182480,184000,which is why i got them so you get
O3OQEVpZDIE,184000,185840,higher rolling resistance and they still
O3OQEVpZDIE,185840,187040,pinch flat
O3OQEVpZDIE,187040,187840,uh
O3OQEVpZDIE,187840,189599,no you can't they don't pinch flat super
O3OQEVpZDIE,189599,191760,easy but yeah it's just putting two
O3OQEVpZDIE,191760,193519,different heavy heavy putting two
O3OQEVpZDIE,193519,195599,different technologies together the
O3OQEVpZDIE,195599,197519,downside was they were quite hard to fit
O3OQEVpZDIE,197519,198879,they were absolutely nightmare to
O3OQEVpZDIE,198879,200800,wrestle on the rims but
O3OQEVpZDIE,200800,202480,i used them for cyclocross so if you had
O3OQEVpZDIE,202480,204080,the pressures a bit lower
O3OQEVpZDIE,204080,205840,considering how hard they were to get on
O3OQEVpZDIE,205840,208959,they literally fell off the wheels
O3OQEVpZDIE,208959,210959,so yeah i kind of regret those yeah cool
O3OQEVpZDIE,210959,212560,at the time though
O3OQEVpZDIE,212560,214319,yeah yeah believe it or not i did some
O3OQEVpZDIE,214319,216480,research on this this this still exists
O3OQEVpZDIE,216480,218159,no way still get them
O3OQEVpZDIE,218159,219920,well i've got one again yeah this is
O3OQEVpZDIE,219920,222159,going back quite let's be
O3OQEVpZDIE,222159,224400,probably yeah going back again 10 12
O3OQEVpZDIE,224400,227360,years ago um super light inner tubes
O3OQEVpZDIE,227360,228799,okay yeah now this needs a bit of
O3OQEVpZDIE,228799,231680,context right because at the time i was
O3OQEVpZDIE,231680,233920,a student i was on a student budget just
O3OQEVpZDIE,233920,235280,last year
O3OQEVpZDIE,235280,237280,and i was trying to save weight on my
O3OQEVpZDIE,237280,238959,bike and improve performance and so i
O3OQEVpZDIE,238959,242080,was putting in i invested in some what
O3OQEVpZDIE,242080,243519,relative to a normal tube they were a
O3OQEVpZDIE,243519,245840,lot more expensive yeah super thin light
O3OQEVpZDIE,245840,247760,butyl inner tubes that weighed like 20
O3OQEVpZDIE,247760,251920,grams okay now saved about 150 grams
O3OQEVpZDIE,251920,254159,great big white savings yeah it is for
O3OQEVpZDIE,254159,256239,like not much money comparatively yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,256239,259280,but i was descending hard not pass which
O3OQEVpZDIE,259280,260479,is like 30
O3OQEVpZDIE,260479,261359,plus
O3OQEVpZDIE,261359,263280,and the road was wet so i was dragging
O3OQEVpZDIE,263280,264320,the brakes
O3OQEVpZDIE,264320,266800,and i was using alloy rim brakes at the
O3OQEVpZDIE,266800,269840,time as everyone was back then and
O3OQEVpZDIE,269840,273120,yeah in the olden days and um
O3OQEVpZDIE,273120,275280,the the rims get really hot yeah when
O3OQEVpZDIE,275280,277520,you're dragging the brakes and so the
O3OQEVpZDIE,277520,279360,alloy rims heated and then they caused
O3OQEVpZDIE,279360,282080,the tubes to explode so i'd blow out
O3OQEVpZDIE,282080,283840,descending 30 that's not what you want
O3OQEVpZDIE,283840,286080,that's not ideal and i i mean the bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,286080,288560,was lighter though yeah in fairness when
O3OQEVpZDIE,288560,290400,i looked when i read the small print
O3OQEVpZDIE,290400,292400,that came with them the tubes they
O3OQEVpZDIE,292400,294080,didn't say they weren't suitable for
O3OQEVpZDIE,294080,296800,that for prolonged breaking yeah who
O3OQEVpZDIE,296800,298080,reads the instructions i guess you've
O3OQEVpZDIE,298080,300000,only got yourself to blame yes and but
O3OQEVpZDIE,300000,302240,the thing is now is super light inner
O3OQEVpZDIE,302240,303680,tubes now have actually become something
O3OQEVpZDIE,303680,305280,that you can use
O3OQEVpZDIE,305280,307440,because this breaks the heat doesn't
O3OQEVpZDIE,307440,310080,build up in the rim yeah it's isolated
O3OQEVpZDIE,310080,312160,to the brake the disc so
O3OQEVpZDIE,312160,314160,now you don't have that problem but if
O3OQEVpZDIE,314160,315759,you're using rim brakes yeah back then
O3OQEVpZDIE,315759,317039,you have that problem super light disc
O3OQEVpZDIE,317039,319520,brakes super light tubes now i've got a
O3OQEVpZDIE,319520,321600,question for you do you regret buying
O3OQEVpZDIE,321600,323520,the euro bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,323520,324880,what about that
O3OQEVpZDIE,324880,326400,do you know what no
O3OQEVpZDIE,326400,329440,no well if i'd bought it to be my actual
O3OQEVpZDIE,329440,331680,bike and i was like in the market for a
O3OQEVpZDIE,331680,334320,budget bike i'd regret it but in the
O3OQEVpZDIE,334320,336400,context of it's all about context with
O3OQEVpZDIE,336400,338479,these yeah in the context of us buying
O3OQEVpZDIE,338479,340080,it i don't regret buying it at all
O3OQEVpZDIE,340080,341440,because we've had so much fun with it
O3OQEVpZDIE,341440,342960,we've had a lot of fun yeah we've just
O3OQEVpZDIE,342960,344400,made some like cool videos it's actually
O3OQEVpZDIE,344400,345680,covered a lot of miles yeah it's a good
O3OQEVpZDIE,345680,347360,laugh isn't it i mean look at the video
O3OQEVpZDIE,347360,349680,we did with with rory on it and
O3OQEVpZDIE,349680,351600,also when we would you know destroy an
O3OQEVpZDIE,351600,353199,oscar normally oscar ruins his own
O3OQEVpZDIE,353199,355440,clients but like oscar's struggling away
O3OQEVpZDIE,355440,358720,on the europe not that day
O3OQEVpZDIE,358720,360080,and something else which i kind of
O3OQEVpZDIE,360080,362720,regret buying and owning again we're
O3OQEVpZDIE,362720,365199,going back about 15 years or so an aero
O3OQEVpZDIE,365199,367600,helmet so like time trial error helmet
O3OQEVpZDIE,367600,369360,but it was just like a plastic shell it
O3OQEVpZDIE,369360,371440,didn't offer any protection in terms of
O3OQEVpZDIE,371440,373520,safety remember those things like lance
O3OQEVpZDIE,373520,375039,used to wear them
O3OQEVpZDIE,375039,377120,ones yeah yeah i had one of those so
O3OQEVpZDIE,377120,378160,when i was
O3OQEVpZDIE,378160,379360,yeah i reckon
O3OQEVpZDIE,379360,382319,15 16 i just started being old enough to
O3OQEVpZDIE,382319,383759,go and do some time trials was it one of
O3OQEVpZDIE,383759,385840,those super pointy ones yeah it was like
O3OQEVpZDIE,385840,388560,super pointy i thought i was so cool at
O3OQEVpZDIE,388560,391600,the time right um so yeah bombing up and
O3OQEVpZDIE,391600,393600,down jewel carriage ways as like a kid
O3OQEVpZDIE,393600,395680,which seems pretty dangerous now let
O3OQEVpZDIE,395680,396880,alone the fact that you've got a helmet
O3OQEVpZDIE,396880,398720,which offers zero protection but did
O3OQEVpZDIE,398720,400000,make me a little bit faster at the time
O3OQEVpZDIE,400000,401520,the rule was that you had to wear a
O3OQEVpZDIE,401520,403039,helmet but there was no like rule
O3OQEVpZDIE,403039,404720,regarding like the actual safety
O3OQEVpZDIE,404720,406800,credibility of the helmet no
O3OQEVpZDIE,406800,408960,define a helmet like the definition of
O3OQEVpZDIE,408960,410240,what the helmet was it was actually
O3OQEVpZDIE,410240,412880,shortly after um shortly after i got
O3OQEVpZDIE,412880,414400,into time trials back then that they
O3OQEVpZDIE,414400,415680,changed the rules and then you had to
O3OQEVpZDIE,415680,417759,actually wear a helmet offered some sort
O3OQEVpZDIE,417759,420240,of level of safety which is a good idea
O3OQEVpZDIE,420240,421440,it makes a lot of sense it wasn't a
O3OQEVpZDIE,421440,423360,helmet it was like a head fairing a head
O3OQEVpZDIE,423360,424720,fairy yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,424720,426560,a head fairy so i kind of regret owning
O3OQEVpZDIE,426560,428080,that
O3OQEVpZDIE,428080,429759,i got i've got another one yeah oh
O3OQEVpZDIE,429759,432240,symmetric chain rings so i bought
O3OQEVpZDIE,432240,434400,osimetric chainrings because i was out
O3OQEVpZDIE,434400,436720,on a ride yeah when i was a student
O3OQEVpZDIE,436720,438880,again with one of my friends and i
O3OQEVpZDIE,438880,440400,always used to beat him on all the
O3OQEVpZDIE,440400,442479,climbs and then he had got some
O3OQEVpZDIE,442479,444080,osymmetric chain rings and for the first
O3OQEVpZDIE,444080,445759,time ever he somehow beat me on a climb
O3OQEVpZDIE,445759,448000,so i thought wow it could be that that's
O3OQEVpZDIE,448000,450000,all it could be that's all it could be
O3OQEVpZDIE,450000,452240,so i then instantly went out and bought
O3OQEVpZDIE,452240,454800,some yeah and
O3OQEVpZDIE,454800,456639,there was just like no difference except
O3OQEVpZDIE,456639,459039,for i was then in a road race a few
O3OQEVpZDIE,459039,461440,weeks later and because i had osymmetric
O3OQEVpZDIE,461440,463120,chainrings on a crucial moment in the
O3OQEVpZDIE,463120,465520,race i dropped my chain and then got
O3OQEVpZDIE,465520,467680,dropped so which you'll all enjoy i
O3OQEVpZDIE,467680,468800,don't know what i told you that i'm just
O3OQEVpZDIE,468800,470479,giving you more fuel to the fire yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,470479,472000,but yeah i got through i've never heard
O3OQEVpZDIE,472000,473840,any dropped stores yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,473840,475039,yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,475039,477039,um yeah and
O3OQEVpZDIE,477039,478639,at the time there was a load of thing
O3OQEVpZDIE,478639,480160,about oh symmetric chain rings they make
O3OQEVpZDIE,480160,482240,more power but what hadn't been revealed
O3OQEVpZDIE,482240,484160,was that team sky thought they made more
O3OQEVpZDIE,484160,485599,power but it's because the power meters
O3OQEVpZDIE,485599,487919,they were using just read differently
O3OQEVpZDIE,487919,489840,weren't designed to read an asymmetric
O3OQEVpZDIE,489840,492319,chainring and so they over read by like
O3OQEVpZDIE,492319,493840,twenty percent on it now this thing is
O3OQEVpZDIE,493840,495759,incredible yeah we've invented a
O3OQEVpZDIE,495759,497759,perpetual motion machine
O3OQEVpZDIE,497759,499199,it's like no
O3OQEVpZDIE,499199,500800,um okay right that sounds like a good
O3OQEVpZDIE,500800,502400,one um
O3OQEVpZDIE,502400,504160,trying to think of another product right
O3OQEVpZDIE,504160,506639,super lightweight cassette so yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,506639,507440,back
O3OQEVpZDIE,507440,509360,in the day when i was in junior and
O3OQEVpZDIE,509360,511840,mountain biking i remember
O3OQEVpZDIE,511840,513599,i was changing loads of parts on my
O3OQEVpZDIE,513599,516159,mountain bike ready for the 2007
O3OQEVpZDIE,516159,518159,mountain world champs in fort william
O3OQEVpZDIE,518159,519839,and i bought super light parts the one
O3OQEVpZDIE,519839,521839,that i really regret buying was an ultra
O3OQEVpZDIE,521839,524320,light cassette so this thing was like
O3OQEVpZDIE,524320,526399,super bling gold it was machined out one
O3OQEVpZDIE,526399,528240,piece of aluminium it was blooming light
O3OQEVpZDIE,528240,531200,it looked it looked incredible however i
O3OQEVpZDIE,531200,533200,put it on my bike a few weeks before the
O3OQEVpZDIE,533200,534800,race and it just
O3OQEVpZDIE,534800,537440,wore out so fast it was unbelievable
O3OQEVpZDIE,537440,538959,yeah i didn't get to i didn't get to use
O3OQEVpZDIE,538959,540480,it in the race because it wore out that
O3OQEVpZDIE,540480,542160,quickly i had to take it off my bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,542160,544959,before the race and i mean at the time
O3OQEVpZDIE,544959,546399,it cost an absolute bomb i didn't have
O3OQEVpZDIE,546399,548320,loads of money spare and i was like well
O3OQEVpZDIE,548320,549760,i just wasted all my money i've got any
O3OQEVpZDIE,549760,551920,left to buy because i mean i can think
O3OQEVpZDIE,551920,553279,now you've said that there's a load of
O3OQEVpZDIE,553279,554560,things that just popped into my head of
O3OQEVpZDIE,554560,556640,like really lightweight things that i
O3OQEVpZDIE,556640,558160,bought that i regret buying i think
O3OQEVpZDIE,558160,560320,that's yeah it's when you when you're on
O3OQEVpZDIE,560320,561519,a budget or you don't want to spend
O3OQEVpZDIE,561519,564160,loads of money buying the lightest most
O3OQEVpZDIE,564160,566399,aero product you can get at the low
O3OQEVpZDIE,566399,568000,price point isn't necessary they're
O3OQEVpZDIE,568000,570320,often compromised
O3OQEVpZDIE,570320,571839,lightweight brakes that were really
O3OQEVpZDIE,571839,573839,light for like a hill climb build yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,573839,575600,amazing for the hill climb because they
O3OQEVpZDIE,575600,577440,weighed like a hundred grams without
O3OQEVpZDIE,577440,579600,going back down there yeah not so great
O3OQEVpZDIE,579600,582080,you gotta get back to your car
O3OQEVpZDIE,582080,583839,yeah yeah like the braking performance
O3OQEVpZDIE,583839,586640,on them was absolutely terrible compared
O3OQEVpZDIE,586640,589279,to like a shimano caliper just normal
O3OQEVpZDIE,589279,591040,yeah normal okay well those are some of
O3OQEVpZDIE,591040,593200,the things that we regret buying yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,593200,594800,well i regret buying lots of things but
O3OQEVpZDIE,594800,596959,that's sort of brushed the surface of it
O3OQEVpZDIE,596959,599200,and we should probably have a pole yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,599200,599920,yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,599920,602320,go on you got a pole in mind have you
O3OQEVpZDIE,602320,604800,like have you ever regretted buying a
O3OQEVpZDIE,604800,607040,cycling product and if you have it's
O3OQEVpZDIE,607040,608240,hard to do this in the polls so you just
O3OQEVpZDIE,608240,610399,have to comment it underneath the poll
O3OQEVpZDIE,610399,611680,comment what you've what you've
O3OQEVpZDIE,611680,614240,regretted buying and um we'll read some
O3OQEVpZDIE,614240,616000,out in the show next week i can't wait
O3OQEVpZDIE,616000,619240,to read something
O3OQEVpZDIE,622480,625200,it's now time for hot tech um ollie kick
O3OQEVpZDIE,625200,627519,us off what we got new helmet
O3OQEVpZDIE,627519,629680,yeah first of this week is a limited
O3OQEVpZDIE,629680,632480,edition cask vellegro helmet for this
O3OQEVpZDIE,632480,634480,year's tour de france it's the official
O3OQEVpZDIE,634480,636160,tour de france helmet i believe yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,636160,637839,check this out very fancy pants so
O3OQEVpZDIE,637839,639720,there's just 3
O3OQEVpZDIE,639720,642079,328 of these are going to be produced
O3OQEVpZDIE,642079,643519,that's quite a strange number alex why
O3OQEVpZDIE,643519,645200,is that number been chosen well i'm glad
O3OQEVpZDIE,645200,647600,you asked it's to do with the number of
O3OQEVpZDIE,647600,650160,kilometers that this year's race covers
O3OQEVpZDIE,650160,652480,yeah um good job i didn't do it in miles
O3OQEVpZDIE,652480,654560,every day every day's a school day every
O3OQEVpZDIE,654560,656640,day is a school day it's got a cool like
O3OQEVpZDIE,656640,658399,white design yellow lines over it some
O3OQEVpZDIE,658399,659839,black accents yeah i like the look of
O3OQEVpZDIE,659839,662880,this yeah nice pretty cool um right
O3OQEVpZDIE,662880,666160,we've also got some limited edition
O3OQEVpZDIE,666160,669519,bottles or bidon if you're french or
O3OQEVpZDIE,669519,671200,pretentious
O3OQEVpZDIE,671200,673200,last month yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,673200,674959,last month you may remember we had some
O3OQEVpZDIE,674959,676560,nice pink limited edition bottles
O3OQEVpZDIE,676560,677839,available in shop like global cycling
O3OQEVpZDIE,677839,679839,network for the big italian bike ride
O3OQEVpZDIE,679839,682160,that was happening well the big french
O3OQEVpZDIE,682160,684560,bike ride is happening soon yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,684560,687200,so we've got joan bottles
O3OQEVpZDIE,687200,689279,yellow if you're not french yeah or
O3OQEVpZDIE,689279,691760,pretentious um only available in 500 ml
O3OQEVpZDIE,691760,693680,versions these ones super lightweight i
O3OQEVpZDIE,693680,695200,like to look at these guys
O3OQEVpZDIE,695200,696399,i'm going to take those and put them on
O3OQEVpZDIE,696399,698160,my bike not have one inch or you're just
O3OQEVpZDIE,698160,700880,taking a pair uh yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,700880,703040,thanks okay right
O3OQEVpZDIE,703040,705200,well sums up and also coming up next in
O3OQEVpZDIE,705200,707839,hot tech we've got a new solar powered
O3OQEVpZDIE,707839,709519,hedge unit from garmin check this out it
O3OQEVpZDIE,709519,711600,looks pretty cool it's called the edge
O3OQEVpZDIE,711600,715360,1040 solar and replaces the edge 1030
O3OQEVpZDIE,715360,716959,and the standout feature is that it's
O3OQEVpZDIE,716959,719040,got an integrated solar panel on the
O3OQEVpZDIE,719040,720079,screen
O3OQEVpZDIE,720079,721920,and i think it's an absolutely brilliant
O3OQEVpZDIE,721920,723760,idea this is really so it's able to
O3OQEVpZDIE,723760,726240,charge it as you use it as long as it's
O3OQEVpZDIE,726240,729440,in direct sunlight but it isn't able to
O3OQEVpZDIE,729440,731839,just completely fully run off the solar
O3OQEVpZDIE,731839,732959,panel no
O3OQEVpZDIE,732959,734399,think of it more of like a range
O3OQEVpZDIE,734399,737519,extender so as you use it for every hour
O3OQEVpZDIE,737519,739680,that it's in sunlight it's said to sort
O3OQEVpZDIE,739680,742160,of give you an additional 20 to 40
O3OQEVpZDIE,742160,745040,minutes of battery life yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,745040,746800,yeah i think that isn't cool i guess the
O3OQEVpZDIE,746800,748560,amount of charge it gets depends on like
O3OQEVpZDIE,748560,750079,the light conditions and how much you're
O3OQEVpZDIE,750079,751760,using the device probably not much in
O3OQEVpZDIE,751760,753680,england yeah not much in england you
O3OQEVpZDIE,753680,755120,barely get anything in england we don't
O3OQEVpZDIE,755120,757440,even get sunny days do we no um so the
O3OQEVpZDIE,757440,759600,battery life is said to be around 45
O3OQEVpZDIE,759600,761839,hours even in what garmin called
O3OQEVpZDIE,761839,764079,demanding use not sure what demanding is
O3OQEVpZDIE,764079,765440,maybe just being really aggressive and
O3OQEVpZDIE,765440,767200,shouting at it yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,767200,769839,the screen is so there's the solar
O3OQEVpZDIE,769839,771760,charging element is all of the top
O3OQEVpZDIE,771760,773200,surface of the screen however the
O3OQEVpZDIE,773200,774639,difference being
O3OQEVpZDIE,774639,776720,where the actual display section is so
O3OQEVpZDIE,776720,778320,we've got the numbers and the colors
O3OQEVpZDIE,778320,780079,that still charges the device but it's
O3OQEVpZDIE,780079,782480,only about 10 efficient most of the
O3OQEVpZDIE,782480,784720,charging comes from that dark bezel
O3OQEVpZDIE,784720,786399,around the edge yeah and that can charge
O3OQEVpZDIE,786399,788079,it up sort of hundred percent efficiency
O3OQEVpZDIE,788079,789760,rate so that's where it gets most of its
O3OQEVpZDIE,789760,791760,juice from it's yeah i think it's a cool
O3OQEVpZDIE,791760,793519,idea and i like it with that extra range
O3OQEVpZDIE,793519,796079,for like endurance events
O3OQEVpZDIE,796079,797600,multi-day events yeah it could be really
O3OQEVpZDIE,797600,799200,cool wouldn't it right and then finally
O3OQEVpZDIE,799200,800720,in hot tech this week we've got some
O3OQEVpZDIE,800720,803519,chunky new gravelly boy wheels from hunt
O3OQEVpZDIE,803519,805680,these look super cool right so these
O3OQEVpZDIE,805680,807600,wheels are the carbon gravel disc and
O3OQEVpZDIE,807600,808800,you've got two different versions
O3OQEVpZDIE,808800,811120,available you've got 25 millimeter depth
O3OQEVpZDIE,811120,813440,and a 40 millimeter depth
O3OQEVpZDIE,813440,816560,now hunts say the 40mm ones are designed
O3OQEVpZDIE,816560,818399,to be a little bit more suitable for use
O3OQEVpZDIE,818399,820800,on the road as well so they're actually
O3OQEVpZDIE,820800,822800,slightly narrower internal rim width
O3OQEVpZDIE,822800,825040,than the 25 millimeter ones so i've got
O3OQEVpZDIE,825040,825920,the
O3OQEVpZDIE,825920,827519,tyre widths that they're compatible with
O3OQEVpZDIE,827519,830639,here so the 25 deep rims are compatible
O3OQEVpZDIE,830639,833839,with 35 to 65 millimeter tyres and the
O3OQEVpZDIE,833839,838000,25s no sorry the 40s are compatible with
O3OQEVpZDIE,838000,840320,28 tyres again up to 65 so a little bit
O3OQEVpZDIE,840320,842240,narrower for the 40mm deep they're
O3OQEVpZDIE,842240,843360,hookless
O3OQEVpZDIE,843360,845680,and do you want some weights and prices
O3OQEVpZDIE,845680,849199,love them so the 25mm deeps are
O3OQEVpZDIE,849199,851240,eight seven nine pounds or
O3OQEVpZDIE,851240,855199,1179 euros and weigh
O3OQEVpZDIE,855199,858880,1 380 grams and if you want the 40s
O3OQEVpZDIE,858880,862040,they are 899 pounds 1
O3OQEVpZDIE,862040,863920,199
O3OQEVpZDIE,863920,866320,and they're just 3 grams heavier
O3OQEVpZDIE,866320,868959,just 3 grams heavier for 40 ml deep boys
O3OQEVpZDIE,868959,870480,does that work
O3OQEVpZDIE,870480,871760,i'm not entirely sure actually
O3OQEVpZDIE,871760,872639,presumably because they're a bit
O3OQEVpZDIE,872639,873600,narrower
O3OQEVpZDIE,873600,874800,i don't understand how that's working at
O3OQEVpZDIE,874800,877120,all it's the magic of science
O3OQEVpZDIE,877120,878639,who knows i did double check that but
O3OQEVpZDIE,878639,880399,three grams is right apparently yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,880399,884279,more hot tech next week
O3OQEVpZDIE,885040,886079,this is now where we're going to do
O3OQEVpZDIE,886079,887360,comments of the week but we're not going
O3OQEVpZDIE,887360,888560,to do comments this week because we're
O3OQEVpZDIE,888560,890560,pre-recording the show so
O3OQEVpZDIE,890560,893199,we'll just do bumper comments next week
O3OQEVpZDIE,893199,895120,and we'll go straight into the bike love
O3OQEVpZDIE,895120,896639,the bike this is a section show where
O3OQEVpZDIE,896639,898000,you upload the pictures of your bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,898000,900560,into the gcn app then everyone can judge
O3OQEVpZDIE,900560,902800,them to either nice or super nice as
O3OQEVpZDIE,902800,904399,we've said before all and i we get the
O3OQEVpZDIE,904399,905839,final vote you know with sort of
O3OQEVpZDIE,905839,908399,deciders of this the bell is underneath
O3OQEVpZDIE,908399,910839,here you're super nice well i ring the

O3OQEVpZDIE,995519,998000,ah actually right so i do i i picked
O3OQEVpZDIE,998000,999680,this out of the bike vault because it is
O3OQEVpZDIE,999680,1000959,a physical location we're going to pick
O3OQEVpZDIE,1000959,1003600,the bikes out from and they've uploaded
O3OQEVpZDIE,1003600,1004959,quite a few pictures of this bike so
O3OQEVpZDIE,1004959,1006399,with any luck we'll be able to find some
O3OQEVpZDIE,1006399,1007920,of the other ones as well but it
O3OQEVpZDIE,1007920,1010240,showcased the design process of this and
O3OQEVpZDIE,1010240,1011920,the build of it it looks super cool
O3OQEVpZDIE,1011920,1014560,that's just that that's just
O3OQEVpZDIE,1014560,1016560,lots of words you're lost for words
O3OQEVpZDIE,1016560,1018160,super nice
O3OQEVpZDIE,1018160,1019920,what's the plaque in the background i
O3OQEVpZDIE,1019920,1021279,don't know
O3OQEVpZDIE,1021279,1023120,performance is this something i can't
O3OQEVpZDIE,1023120,1025839,quite see uh next year chris c bradley
O3OQEVpZDIE,1025839,1029038,with a giant revolt advanced zero
O3OQEVpZDIE,1029038,1030720,it looks like just a selection of bike
O3OQEVpZDIE,1030720,1033120,packing accessories yeah where's the
O3OQEVpZDIE,1033120,1036798,bike just it's lost in lavender
O3OQEVpZDIE,1036798,1039519,is
O3OQEVpZDIE,1040079,1043280,it's the wrong way around it's nice nice
O3OQEVpZDIE,1043280,1044959,yeah sorry yeah
O3OQEVpZDIE,1044959,1047199,um bojan basic
O3OQEVpZDIE,1047199,1048240,with us
O3OQEVpZDIE,1048240,1051600,fairlight strail 2. oh i like the look
O3OQEVpZDIE,1051600,1054799,of this this looks nice
