dXgNiQsML6w,1132864,1138536,IT IS COMING AT A TIME WHERE WE   HAVE SEEN SUPPORT RAMP UP FOR   THE U.S. TO WORK HARDER TO FREE   HER.  SHE HAS BEEN IN RUSSIAN CUSTODY 
dXgNiQsML6w,1138536,1149314,"FOR FOUR MONTHS ALREADY.  RUSSIAN PROSECUTORS SAY SHE HAD   A VAPE CARTRIDGE, MORE THAN ONE   VAPE CARTRIDGE, CONTAINING  CANNABIS OIL AT A MOSCOW  AIRPORT IN FEBRUARY."
dXgNiQsML6w,1149314,1172304,SHE COULD BE LOOKING AT 10  YEARS IN PRISON.  STEVE PATTERSON IS JOINING ME.  WE FINALLY HAVE A DATE FOR  GRINER'S CRIMINAL TRIAL AND IT  SEEMS LIKE THE ODDS ARE AGAINST 
dXgNiQsML6w,1172304,1177409,HER.  WHAT ARE HER CHANCES OF GETTING   ACQUITTED ON THIS?  >> I DO NOT THINK IT IS   HYPERBOLE TO SAY IT IS  EXTRAORDINARILY BELOW.
dXgNiQsML6w,1177409,1182714,THINK SLIM TO NONE.   U.S. IS ALREADY POSTURING WITH  THE IDEA THAT THE RUSSIAN   GOVERNMENT IS NOT REALLY  INTERESTED IN JUSTICE IN THIS   PARTICULAR CASE BUT EVEN

dXgNiQsML6w,1219918,1225624,IT IS COMING AS WE ARE SEEING   THIS PRESSURE CAMPAIGN FROM THE   PUBLIC REALLY RAMP UP ON THIS   ADMINISTRATION.   YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PRESSURE  PUTIN INTO DOING IT.
dXgNiQsML6w,1225624,1235067,HE DOES NOT CARE WHAT THE WNBA  THINGS.   THE QUESTION IS WHETHER BIDEN   ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE ABLE TO   RESPOND IN SOME SORT OF

dXgNiQsML6w,1279911,1285383,PROCESS MEANT TO SHOW AT LEAST  THE VENEER OF JUSTICE BEFORE  ANY REAL NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT RUSSIA IS   LIKELY TO ASK FOR A PRISONER
dXgNiQsML6w,1285383,1293525,WHO HAS COMMITTED   DISPROPORTIONATE CRIMES TO  SMUGGLING A VAPE PEN.   THAT IS MORE PRESSURE THAN THE

dXgNiQsML6w,1397696,1403668,THOSE NUMBERS ARE UNFORTUNATELY   EXPECTED TO INCREASE BECAUSE  SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORTS ARE   STILL ONGOING.  THIS CITY IS A COMMUNITY THAT   HAS NOT SEEN A LOT OF MISSILE
