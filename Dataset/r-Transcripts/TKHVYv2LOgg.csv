TKHVYv2LOgg,1469,4810,We spend our whole lives trying to fit in.
TKHVYv2LOgg,4810,6230,We wanna be normal.
TKHVYv2LOgg,6230,10660,But the people we idolise the most are the ones that stand out.
TKHVYv2LOgg,10660,14780,If you wanna be great if you wanna be the best motherf*cker ever
TKHVYv2LOgg,14780,18859,at which you do you're gonna be misunderstood by everybody.
TKHVYv2LOgg,18859,22119,Because you're gonna be so f*cking obsessed and so driven to get there
TKHVYv2LOgg,22119,23119,that's what it takes.
TKHVYv2LOgg,23119,26230,When you are misunderstood to the point where people think you're psycho
TKHVYv2LOgg,26230,28500,"and you're nuts, and you're this and that ""why are you in the f*cking gym"
TKHVYv2LOgg,28500,30749,at 1 o'clock in the f*cking morning?
TKHVYv2LOgg,30749,31749,"What is wrong?"""
TKHVYv2LOgg,31749,35150,When people don't understand you anymore you're in that spot
TKHVYv2LOgg,35150,37040,of obsession and drive.
TKHVYv2LOgg,37040,42300,To be the best at what you do you have to be unbalanced to find every bit
TKHVYv2LOgg,42300,46750,of f*cking energy and strength that you have to pull it off.
TKHVYv2LOgg,46750,52340,And it takes being f*cking obsessed where people think you're crazy.
TKHVYv2LOgg,52340,55750,If you really want this you gotta learn to sacrifice.
TKHVYv2LOgg,55750,57610,You gotta learn to give up to go up.
TKHVYv2LOgg,57610,59760,"While they were golfing, I was studying."
TKHVYv2LOgg,59760,62190,"While they were shooting hoops, I was studying."
TKHVYv2LOgg,62190,65360,"While they were playing games and sitting up, and eating and joking in the"
TKHVYv2LOgg,65360,67040,restaurant I was studying.
TKHVYv2LOgg,67040,70890,You can't get out of something something that you're not willing to put into
TKHVYv2LOgg,70890,71890,it.
TKHVYv2LOgg,71890,75740,You have to put your everything your everything
TKHVYv2LOgg,75740,76740,your mind your energy
TKHVYv2LOgg,76740,77740,your effort your discipline.
TKHVYv2LOgg,77740,82290,Nothing is gonna jump out the fire if you don't throw something in there
TKHVYv2LOgg,82290,84460,it's not gonna happen.
TKHVYv2LOgg,84460,87840,But if you dare to be great if you dare to go to limits that you've never
TKHVYv2LOgg,87840,91979,went to before they will remember your legacy forever.
TKHVYv2LOgg,91979,95750,You know what you gotta do to get to paradise?
TKHVYv2LOgg,95750,99280,You gotta fight like f*cking hell to get to f*cking paradise.
TKHVYv2LOgg,99280,100979,Paradise starts in hell.
TKHVYv2LOgg,100980,104260,It's the ones that can fight the ones that come back
TKHVYv2LOgg,104260,105683,those are the ones that succeed.
TKHVYv2LOgg,105683,107740,If there's something you once envisioned and now it's real
TKHVYv2LOgg,107740,111899,it's 'cause you didn't just envision it you brought so much emotion to it
TKHVYv2LOgg,111900,113760,that you unleashed all your desire.
TKHVYv2LOgg,113760,115060,You became obsessed with it.
TKHVYv2LOgg,115060,116439,You started with a concrete vision of what you wanted
TKHVYv2LOgg,116440,118170,"and you focused on it continuously, didn't you?"
TKHVYv2LOgg,118170,119250,Wherever focus goes energy flows.
TKHVYv2LOgg,119250,120250,You have to be obsessive.
TKHVYv2LOgg,120250,121610,You have to be addicted.
TKHVYv2LOgg,121610,124280,You have to be disciplined.
TKHVYv2LOgg,124280,131240,If you wanna show me you wanna win that bad pack your calendar.
TKHVYv2LOgg,131240,134570,You pack your calendar that's how you show the world
TKHVYv2LOgg,134570,137849,that you wanna win because everything is based off of activity.
TKHVYv2LOgg,137849,142620,It's mathematically impossible for you not to win at the highest level
TKHVYv2LOgg,142620,144980,if your calendar is packed from day 'till night
TKHVYv2LOgg,144980,146550,every single day the entire year
TKHVYv2LOgg,146550,148900,"day, after day, after day, after day, after day"
TKHVYv2LOgg,148900,149900,without you winning.
TKHVYv2LOgg,149900,150900,You gotta work smarter and you gotta work f*cking harder.
TKHVYv2LOgg,150900,151900,You gotta f*cking do both.
TKHVYv2LOgg,151900,154670,"Those times when you get up early, and you work hard"
TKHVYv2LOgg,154670,159209,"those times when you stay up late, and you work hard"
TKHVYv2LOgg,159210,165810,"those times when you don't feel like working you're too tired, you don't wanna push yourself"
TKHVYv2LOgg,165810,169940,but you do it anyway that is actually the dream.
TKHVYv2LOgg,169940,172550,Greatness is not something that you meet once.
TKHVYv2LOgg,172550,176230,It's something that you meet thousands of f*cking times in your life
TKHVYv2LOgg,176230,179610,and you don't reach it if you're not constantly in constant
TKHVYv2LOgg,179610,180840,f*cking pursuit of greatness.
TKHVYv2LOgg,180840,183519,And when you do this long enough winning becomes
TKHVYv2LOgg,183520,188489,not something that you aspire to do winning becomes who the f*ck you are.
