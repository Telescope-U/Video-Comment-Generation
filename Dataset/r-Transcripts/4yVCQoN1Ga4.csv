4yVCQoN1Ga4,3840,11120,there's no better pathway to  self-realization and the ennoblement of  being than to posit the highest good
4yVCQoN1Ga4,11120,16360,that you can conceive of and commit  yourself to it
4yVCQoN1Ga4,16960,23519,and then you might also ask yourself and  this is definitely worth asking is do  you really have anything better to do
4yVCQoN1Ga4,23519,27840,and if you don't well why would you do  anything else
4yVCQoN1Ga4,28640,34640,i've looked in the mirror every morning  and asked myself if today were the last  day of my life would i want to do what i
4yVCQoN1Ga4,34640,41200,am about to do today  and whenever the answer has been no for
4yVCQoN1Ga4,41200,47120,too many days in a row i know i need to  change something because almost  everything all pride all fear of
4yVCQoN1Ga4,47120,53039,embarrassment or failure these things  just fall away in the face of death  leaving only what is truly important
4yVCQoN1Ga4,53039,61120,remembering that you are going to die is  the best way i know to avoid the trap of  thinking you have something to lose
4yVCQoN1Ga4,61520,68080,life is not easy it is not don't try to  make it that way life's not fair it  never was it isn't now and it won't ever
4yVCQoN1Ga4,68080,75520,be  do not fall into the trap the  entitlement trap of feeling like you're
4yVCQoN1Ga4,75520,82720,a victim  you are not  get over it get off
4yVCQoN1Ga4,84479,91240,and yes most things are more rewarding  when you break a sweat to get them
4yVCQoN1Ga4,100479,107200,you've never done something before  you expect yourself to be awesome at it  you haven't done the work you haven't
4yVCQoN1Ga4,107200,113360,put in the time you haven't  put in the study hours you haven't had  the experience
4yVCQoN1Ga4,113360,119520,but you expect to be good and because  you expect to be good but you know  you're not going to be good you don't do
4yVCQoN1Ga4,119520,125119,anything  you want to be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,125119,131280,somebody who succeeds you want to be  somebody who builds something you want  to be somebody who people write books
4yVCQoN1Ga4,131280,139959,about one day you're gonna have to be  okay with being baddish  for a long time
4yVCQoN1Ga4,142080,148640,those times when you get up early and  you work hard  those times when you stay up late and  you work hard those times when you don't

4yVCQoN1Ga4,161920,167400,that's the dream it's not the  destination it's the journey
4yVCQoN1Ga4,178540,184640,[Music]  everybody's got to find their own path
4yVCQoN1Ga4,184640,190319,and you have to realize that when you  get on that path  you're going to up

4yVCQoN1Ga4,199200,204879,but as long as you're willing to learn  and you're willing to take those as  lessons about and you're smart enough to
4yVCQoN1Ga4,204879,213840,not make those same mistakes over and  over and over again  there's really nothing that you can't do
4yVCQoN1Ga4,215440,221120,what are you giving  many people will leave the universe  without a trace

4yVCQoN1Ga4,234560,241840,will you leave what will be different  because you came this way  someone once said that life is our gift
4yVCQoN1Ga4,241840,247760,to us  that god has given us and how we live  our lives is our gift to god what kind
4yVCQoN1Ga4,247760,253599,of gift are you formulating  [Music]
4yVCQoN1Ga4,253599,259040,one of the things that we must do  is that we must be involved in working

4yVCQoN1Ga4,398639,405280,but you've got to decide  that i'm going to be fearless  i refuse to be denied
4yVCQoN1Ga4,405280,410560,and i'm going to go all out i'm going to  be relentless i don't care how many no's

4yVCQoN1Ga4,460960,468240,everybody thinks they're going to turn  inside like an archaeologist and find  that thing their deepest passion the  thing they always love hiding inside
4yVCQoN1Ga4,468240,473759,is as soon as you say it i hope it  sounds ridiculous that you would love  something that much and yet somehow be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,473759,481520,blind to it  it doesn't work like that  but if you really want a passion
4yVCQoN1Ga4,481520,485440,you've got to go through the process of  gaining
4yVCQoN1Ga4,489200,495599,[Music]  mastery it was about changing my  identity
4yVCQoN1Ga4,495599,505000,because at the end of the day  identity and values drive behavior
4yVCQoN1Ga4,506479,513680,willpower is built through voluntary  acts of quote-unquote suffering
4yVCQoN1Ga4,513680,520880,to do hard work is to grow  to push yourself on a project the places  that frighten you is to expand your
4yVCQoN1Ga4,520880,527040,creative capabilities pleasure seekers  don't create monuments
4yVCQoN1Ga4,527279,534160,any creative person has to face the  arrows and slings of their critics so  you get to world class through the
4yVCQoN1Ga4,534160,540880,doorway of discomfort  you do it by walking into the
4yVCQoN1Ga4,540880,547959,metaphorical hard winters of growth  that's how you train
4yVCQoN1Ga4,552800,559920,if you live properly history will not be  able to ignore that you lived and that's  the way you were born to live you were
4yVCQoN1Ga4,559920,565360,born to make a mark in life that leaves  fertilizer for the seed of the next
4yVCQoN1Ga4,565360,570480,generation to take root  i believe god has a dream and a vision
4yVCQoN1Ga4,570480,576720,for your life that's supposed to carry  you right out into eternity because  that's what's pulling it and that when
4yVCQoN1Ga4,576720,583200,you die you're supposed to leave this  earth not on pension but on purpose
4yVCQoN1Ga4,583340,589120,[Music]  that it should not be untied but it  should be unfinished
4yVCQoN1Ga4,589120,596000,most people actually leave the earth  tired  [Music]
4yVCQoN1Ga4,596000,601440,not completed and we need to make sure  that we can say at the end of our lives  it
4yVCQoN1Ga4,601440,607079,is finished not i am retired
4yVCQoN1Ga4,612080,615259,[Music]
4yVCQoN1Ga4,618240,624880,have an idea or dream and they give up  on it no no don't do that work your  dream until it get hard see most things
4yVCQoN1Ga4,624880,630399,don't happen as soon as we think they  should happen  the messenger misery might drop in on
4yVCQoN1Ga4,630399,636079,you and say hello  murphy's law might come by and thump you  on the head
4yVCQoN1Ga4,636079,642160,any number of things can happen to  interrupt your flow it's okay don't take  it personal
4yVCQoN1Ga4,642160,649200,just acknowledge what's going on is  called life  and keep on working on your dream  continue to keep on knocking keep on
4yVCQoN1Ga4,649200,655760,knocking because this is your life  this is what you love this is your  passion
4yVCQoN1Ga4,656079,663120,during the process of gaining mastery  you'll find out whether you actually  like that thing enough to become great  at it it is my belief whatever it is you
4yVCQoN1Ga4,663120,668959,set out to there should be one litmus  test  you should be able to ask and  affirmatively answer the following
4yVCQoN1Ga4,668959,675839,question  do i want to know more about this than  anyone else in the world
4yVCQoN1Ga4,676240,681839,don't get into something unless you plan  to be the best that's my piece of advice
4yVCQoN1Ga4,682320,688800,but if you want to have the passion to  make something big  to make big change it's got to be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,688800,694560,something that you believe in beyond  reasonable doubt it's got to be  something you've just got to make happen
4yVCQoN1Ga4,694560,699839,so ask yourself do i want to know more  about this than anyone else because  you're going to have to get better at it
4yVCQoN1Ga4,699839,705920,than anyone else  it's about
4yVCQoN1Ga4,705920,711600,facing your fears  [Music]  it takes discipline to face your fears
4yVCQoN1Ga4,711600,717390,so you can conquer them  [Music]
4yVCQoN1Ga4,717760,725120,and that's what discipline is discipline  means taking the hard road the uphill  road to do what's right
4yVCQoN1Ga4,725120,731399,for yourself and for other people
4yVCQoN1Ga4,731440,738000,but the discipline will not allow that  the discipline calls for strength and
4yVCQoN1Ga4,738000,744480,fortitude and will  it won't accept weakness it won't
4yVCQoN1Ga4,744480,748800,tolerate another breakdown
4yVCQoN1Ga4,750240,759079,the discipline  can seem  like it's your worst enemy
4yVCQoN1Ga4,759360,765519,but the reality is  discipline is your best friend it will
4yVCQoN1Ga4,765519,773760,take care of you like nothing else can  and it'll put you on that path
4yVCQoN1Ga4,773760,781639,the path to strength and health  and intelligence and happiness
4yVCQoN1Ga4,789040,794240,i'm saying this is a time more than ever  that you want to begin to inoculate
4yVCQoN1Ga4,794240,799920,yourself with positive words coming to  conventions showing up on meetings being
4yVCQoN1Ga4,799920,805519,on the calls to make yourself  unstoppable to get out of your mind the
4yVCQoN1Ga4,805519,813040,polluting negative thoughts that's  causing most people to go through life  being stuck because of volunteer victims
4yVCQoN1Ga4,813040,820000,somebody said that many people died at  age 25 and don't get buried until  they're 65 because they got so much
4yVCQoN1Ga4,820000,829800,garbage in their minds you are here  because you've got a clear vision of  what you want and where you're going
4yVCQoN1Ga4,830160,835839,the only  way to build your ego that is truly  anti-fragile that i have found is to be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,835839,842399,the learner  to be willing to admit when you're wrong  to look at your goal and work backwards
4yVCQoN1Ga4,842399,847519,and say is what i'm doing actually  moving me towards my goal or not not  does it make me feel good about myself
4yVCQoN1Ga4,847519,854079,not am i right not am i smart is it  moving me towards my goal and if it is  then you do it and if it doesn't then
4yVCQoN1Ga4,854079,858879,you don't  where do you start
4yVCQoN1Ga4,860320,866600,you start right here  and when do you start you start right  now

4yVCQoN1Ga4,886720,894639,don't just  take notes  don't just study them  don't just share them with your friends
4yVCQoN1Ga4,894639,900000,don't just plan  don't just mark your calendar don't just

4yVCQoN1Ga4,935360,941720,an individual view what they do will  always affect how they do what they do

4yVCQoN1Ga4,991759,996880,i like it  it's going to make me tougher it's going  to give me a good story to tell it's
4yVCQoN1Ga4,996880,1003120,going to toughen my mind  when something sucks good it's going to  make me tougher and it's going to make

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1033918,1039918,and if you actually ask that question  but you have to want to know the answer  right because that's actually what  asking the question means it doesn't
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1039918,1046079,mean just mouthing the words it means  you have to decide that you want to know  you'll figure that's out so fast it'll
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1046079,1053310,make your hair curl  what would happen if you consulted  yourself about the best possible outcome  for you you might get an answer
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1053310,1058880,[Music]  when people are truly passionate about
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1058880,1064000,what they do you just get a chemical  rush you get the energy you become more
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1064000,1070160,resourceful when someone who doesn't  have passion because they don't really  want to be there anyway they will give  up way easier because they're not having
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1070160,1075600,a good time it's not in them don't try  to change the world unless you seek
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1075600,1081280,change the way a man whose head is on  fire seeks a pond

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1257440,1263000,give him genuine advice one day to get  through it on his own
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1263570,1268720,[Music]  yes  life can be overwhelming that's the way
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1268720,1275360,life works  it is going to throw problems at you and  it is going to throw them at you all at
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1275360,1282000,the same time this is the way life works  but let me tell you that does not mean
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1282000,1284880,give up fighting
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1288240,1294640,let these challenges raise you up let  them elevate you let their demands and
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1294640,1299919,their trials make you stronger let the  adversity you face today turn you into a
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1299919,1307600,better person tomorrow  the person you can control
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1307600,1314640,people are not who you want them to be  kill your idols
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1316559,1323919,sure there are things we can learn from  people but people aren't going to be  what you think they are what they should
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1323919,1326158,be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1330640,1335679,because you can't control other people  you can't
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1335679,1341840,make them what you want them to be  you can't make them who you want them to
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1341840,1349360,be  the only person you can control  is you
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1349520,1355039,so focus on making yourself who you want  to be
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1358080,1364480,you guys need to understand what you  don't have to do  all right you don't have to you don't  have to work hard you don't have to eat  right you don't have to sleep right
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1364480,1369679,you don't have to do more than what's  required of you you don't have to be a  good teammate you don't have to be a  good leader
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1369679,1376000,you don't have to do anything that you  don't want to do  but you also don't have to win you don't  have to you don't have to be a success
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1376000,1381520,in life  so the greatest things in life takes
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1381520,1387919,sacrifice and discipline and that's why  so few people achieve great things  because they don't want to sacrifice
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1387919,1393520,they don't want to discipline it  for some greater  so you see all these people that have
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1393520,1399039,great things in life that you look up to  it's because they were sacrificed and  disciplined long before you ever knew
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1399039,1405200,them  that's the truth so don't get mad later  when you created your whole storm
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1405200,1408559,and then it starts raining on you
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1410960,1416080,surround yourself with dreamers and  doers  the believers and thinkers but most of
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1416080,1423519,all surround yourself with those who see  the greatness within people when they  don't see it in themselves
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1424240,1430480,nothing in life is promised except death  if you had the opportunity  to play this game of life
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1430480,1438320,you need to appreciate every moment  a lot of people don't appreciate their  moment  until it's passed
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1440240,1445600,faster stronger smarter  more humble
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1445600,1450880,less ego  discipline your body

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1462320,1469320,one  small  decision  at a time
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1474960,1480159,if the game will break go against you  don't let up put on more steam

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1504480,1510480,on the road to accomplishment on the  road to evolving and development  if the game of break goes against you in
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1510480,1516799,light  the only favor i ask of you because in  life people don't burn out people don't  quit and people don't underachieve
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1516799,1521919,because of what they do  people burn out people quit and people  underachieve because life makes them
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1521919,1528799,forget why they do it  and so the only favor i ask of you  if the game or break of life go against

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1534400,1540000,when you are struggling  and you start thinking about giving up
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1540000,1545679,i want you to remember  and that is the power of hope
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1545679,1553279,the belief that something better  is always possible if you're willing to  work for it and fight for it it is our
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1553279,1560590,fundamental belief in the power of hope  that has allowed us to rise above the  voices of doubt and division
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1560590,1565919,[Music]  of anger and fear that we have faced
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1565919,1571360,in our own lives our hope that if we  work hard enough and believe in  ourselves
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1571360,1576920,then we can be whatever we dream  regardless of the limitations that  others may place on us
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1576920,1583440,[Music]  the hope that when people see us for who  we truly are
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1583440,1588480,maybe just maybe  they too will be inspired
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1588480,1592640,to rise to their best possible selves

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1625840,1631290,only way to beat it  is look at them eye to eye  and make them your
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1631290,1638640,[Music]  mind says the only thing  that gets you through hard times
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1639600,1645360,when you make the decision to do what  you want to do with your life  just know this
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1645360,1651840,because the family and the friends in  your life do not share your vision
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1652159,1659760,but know this only those that can see  the invisible can do the impossible
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1666880,1670799,when it all boils down to what it is
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1672480,1677840,and if you ain't got more heart than me  if you ain't been working harder than me
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1677840,1683919,if you ain't sacrificed more than me  i'm gonna destroy you and i'm not  retreating
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1683919,1689200,i'm not running  i don't care what they say on paper we  live by this and we die by this
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1689200,1694880,we don't retreat  we don't run every man must search his  own soul you don't judge a person about
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1694880,1701520,where they stand in times of comfort and  convenience you judging by what they  stand in times of challenge and  controversy and if you need work like
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1701520,1708080,when you work for something it gives you  a different type of attachment to it the  harder you work the harder it is to  surrender that's why cats could give up
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1708080,1714480,so easy they ain't gotten an invested  like when a cabin sacrifice for some  well you gonna have a cold day in hell

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1870960,1878559,you are actively choosing to be mediocre  and you are actively  choosing to move further away from what
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1878559,1884559,you want in life because that hardship  and that pain and that struggle and that
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1884559,1889600,frustration  they give you the skills that will forge

4yVCQoN1Ga4,1930399,1936720,thing out  so then these compartments in your brain  they have to work and then you start to
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1936720,1942240,engage parts of your mind that you've  never engaged before when you're in  suffer mode and you say i'm not going to
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1942240,1948320,quit  you're forcing your brain now to operate
4yVCQoN1Ga4,1948320,1954960,on a level it's not used to  but then it becomes used to it your  biggest enemy is you

4yVCQoN1Ga4,2070720,2077358,you're not sacrificing anything you're  actually making an investment because  the investment is delayed gratification
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2077358,2084560,and you just haven't seen the payoff  you don't have to force yourself or  motivate yourself to think negatively to
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2084560,2091358,be depressed to beat yourself up over  the head your mind is on automatic it  will do that by itself
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2091358,2097118,but if you want to begin to move into  your own personal greatness if you want  to begin to really enjoy a happy
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2097118,2103520,successful healthy life you've got to be  willing to go against the tides you've  got to be willing to harness your will

4yVCQoN1Ga4,2273920,2280320,bottom of the next so keep climbing  [Music]
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2280320,2285839,the thing that's so interesting about  being alive is that you're all in no  matter what you do you're all in this is
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2285839,2292560,gonna kill you so i think you might as  well play the most magnificent game you  can while you're waiting because do you
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2292560,2298400,have anything better to do  why not pick the best thing possible  that you could do
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2298400,2304320,because you're more powerful than you  think way more powerful than you think  how much good could you do well i would
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2304320,2309839,say  why do you find out  if you can't fly
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2309839,2315359,run  if you can't run walk
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2315359,2323319,if you can't walk  crawl but by all means keep moving
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2329280,2334480,we all fail it's okay what is not the  case that when you fail you stay down
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2334480,2340480,and winners will fail and get up fail  and get up you always get up that is a
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2340480,2346880,winner  a lot of folk  won't let you forget what you used to do  or what you have done what mistakes
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2346880,2352640,you've made all of us have made some  mistakes in life all of us have done  some things that if we had them to do
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2352640,2359280,over again we wouldn't do it again a lot  of things that if i had to do over again  if i knew then what i know now i would
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2359280,2366480,have done it differently well it didn't  happen that way oh you don't want me to  let that down how you want to keep on  putting that in my face about what i did
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2366480,2372960,guess what i'm not interested that's  what i did then won't do it today
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2374400,2381040,here's what you should know about  winning before you chase it winning's  not loyal to you it doesn't care about  you winning doesn't care how sore you
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2381040,2386560,are when he doesn't care how much sleep  you get when he doesn't care how hard  you work at times winning requires all
4yVCQoN1Ga4,2386560,2394078,of you and then more and it promises you  nothing it's a mastermind of creating  fear and doubt your mind
