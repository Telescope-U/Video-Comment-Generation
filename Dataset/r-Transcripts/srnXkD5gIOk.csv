srnXkD5gIOk,80,5440,is the new m2 macbook pro a lot better than the m1 macbook pro well it actually 
srnXkD5gIOk,5440,10000,might be worse in a couple areas now in this test we're going to compare 
srnXkD5gIOk,10000,13440,everything not only we're going to look at the performance of the cpu and the 
srnXkD5gIOk,13440,16400,graphics we're going to see if the speakers have been improved we're even 
srnXkD5gIOk,16400,21760,going to do a battery life test and remove the bottom covers to see if apple 
srnXkD5gIOk,21760,26720,updated the design or gave it a better fan to deal with the higher power usage 
srnXkD5gIOk,26720,31279,now on the exterior these things are identical unfortunately the new one 
srnXkD5gIOk,31280,36560,still has just two ports on that side no mag safe and the colors that they're 
srnXkD5gIOk,36560,41280,offering is the same thing and people are even getting the same boxes but with 
srnXkD5gIOk,41280,45600,little stickers over the old stuff as well the keyboards and track pads are 
srnXkD5gIOk,45600,49199,the same they both have the same touch bar so this is the last macbook with the 
srnXkD5gIOk,49200,53600,touch bar now as far as the battery both are unplugged right now but they have a 
srnXkD5gIOk,53600,58079,hundred percent charge and i went into the battery information here you guys 
srnXkD5gIOk,58080,63040,could see that this one's brand new cycle two but our m1 version it also has 
srnXkD5gIOk,63040,68080,a hundred percent battery capacity and only 28 cycles proving how little we use 
srnXkD5gIOk,68080,71680,this over the air now both of these are base models that have 8 gigs of ram and 
srnXkD5gIOk,71680,77360,256 gigs of ssd let's go ahead and compare the speeds are you serious 
srnXkD5gIOk,77920,84960,apple how could you do this to us the m2 is slower than the m1 now we let this 
srnXkD5gIOk,84960,89200,run multiple times the m1 speed is amazing 
srnXkD5gIOk,89200,95280,it got way faster than before but apple put in slower ssds it's consistently 
srnXkD5gIOk,95280,99840,this performance i think the fastest we saw on right was 1600 then drops down 
srnXkD5gIOk,100400,107840,1463 compared to 2215 on the right and on the read a 
srnXkD5gIOk,107840,112240,thousand 446 compared to 2 9 
srnXkD5gIOk,112800,116720,100 that is what was that half the speed or less than 
srnXkD5gIOk,116720,120720,half that's exactly half the speed and then we have a difference of about 
srnXkD5gIOk,120720,126080,800 or so on the right serious dude this is actually not even fast enough to get 
srnXkD5gIOk,126080,132000,the full performance out of our sabrin's external ssds the four terabyte we have 
srnXkD5gIOk,132000,136640,well i guess they're saving money not only reusing the chassis the boxes but 
srnXkD5gIOk,137200,140560,putting in suckier ssds you know what that also means 
srnXkD5gIOk,141360,145840,that a gig for the swap that's gonna limit you more so because 
srnXkD5gIOk,145840,151200,the speed of the ssd is half a read and you're reading from the ssd all right 
srnXkD5gIOk,151200,155920,well what else did they mess up here i really hope that the speakers aren't any 
srnXkD5gIOk,155920,170840,quieter because that has happened before [Applause] 
srnXkD5gIOk,178640,182160,now i don't know what to say is it thankfully it didn't get worse or 
srnXkD5gIOk,182160,186640,unfortunately it didn't get any better uh well they're practically the same and 
srnXkD5gIOk,186640,191920,as far as the webcams this is a 720p webcam and the microphones from the m1 
srnXkD5gIOk,191920,197520,macbook pro and this is the same 720p webcam and the microphones from the m2 
srnXkD5gIOk,197520,200320,macbook pro they have been using these ever since 
srnXkD5gIOk,200320,204640,2016. so you guys let me know could you tell the difference and now let's do 
srnXkD5gIOk,204640,210800,what nobody else has shown let's shut these down and pull out our ifixit kit 
srnXkD5gIOk,210800,216720,to see if apple changed anything on the inside could it have a better fan all 
srnXkD5gIOk,216720,220400,right and now let's open up the old one i haven't seen the inside in about a 
srnXkD5gIOk,220400,226159,year and a half all right that explains it the first thing that pops out are the 
srnXkD5gIOk,226160,232400,ssd chips right in the center on the m1 macbook pro we have two of them on the 
srnXkD5gIOk,232400,238720,m2 macbook pro we just have one and that is why it's so slow the way it works is 
srnXkD5gIOk,238720,241920,when you have double the chips they kind of work together almost like in a raid 
srnXkD5gIOk,241920,246400,with the ssd controller and they're way faster than one as we saw with the 
srnXkD5gIOk,246400,252560,blackmagic disk speed test meaning apple is saving money they are cheaping out 
srnXkD5gIOk,252560,259600,and in 2020 a year and a half later we went way backwards in performance and 
srnXkD5gIOk,259600,263840,that is just to save the money now i wonder with the m2 macbook air is it 
srnXkD5gIOk,263840,269120,also gonna be like this or will it even be you know faster than the pro version 
srnXkD5gIOk,269120,273680,and right now if you spend as low as 850 bucks on an m1 macbook air you get 
srnXkD5gIOk,273680,277759,faster performance that's crazy we'll leave a link down in the description now 
srnXkD5gIOk,277760,282320,everything else pretty much looks the same our heatsink over here it looks 
srnXkD5gIOk,282320,286320,slightly different the corners aren't as rounded not as refined as the old 
srnXkD5gIOk,286320,293600,version uh but the size is identical and the fans they also look identical same 
srnXkD5gIOk,293600,298560,thing with the exhaust over here now the m2 chip uses more power we saw that in 
srnXkD5gIOk,298560,302639,yesterday's video we tested it it gets hot apple really should have put in a 
srnXkD5gIOk,302640,306640,second fan into this machine just like they did with the previous four 
srnXkD5gIOk,306640,311600,thunderbolt port a 13 inch macbook pro that would have really helped man apple 
srnXkD5gIOk,311600,315680,is cold-hearted or maybe it's just getting really cold in here with our ac 
srnXkD5gIOk,315680,320800,vadim toss me that sweater this is our m2 chip sweater 
srnXkD5gIOk,321360,325039,if you guys want to pick one up check out the merch shelf down below and use 
srnXkD5gIOk,325040,328800,the code m2 chip no spaces if you want to get 20 
srnXkD5gIOk,329840,332800,off and we'll also have a black and white one as well if you want to go a 
srnXkD5gIOk,332800,337599,little bit more stealth super soft and comfortable now let's go ahead and grab 
srnXkD5gIOk,337600,342400,these covers put them back on and get to benchmarking now let's jump into 
srnXkD5gIOk,342400,346240,performance we're going to start out with a quick geekbench test first off we 
srnXkD5gIOk,346240,351440,see that the m2 shows up to 3.49 gigahertz but in yesterday's test we 
srnXkD5gIOk,351440,357920,couldn't get it to go over 3.3 whereas the m1 sits at 3.2 consistently let's 
srnXkD5gIOk,357920,361280,run it now one thing i noticed that we had a difference in idle temperature 
srnXkD5gIOk,361280,367920,about 29.30 here compared to 3637 on the m2 which is interesting and now just 
srnXkD5gIOk,367920,372480,playing this back where are you at 45 degrees rendering this start compared to 
srnXkD5gIOk,372480,378000,we just hit 31 on the m1 model so this thing definitely heats up quicker all 
srnXkD5gIOk,378000,383600,right bam we have some scores and that's actually the highest score we have seen 
srnXkD5gIOk,383600,389360,for the m2 chip very impressive now we have a great scores for them and one but 
srnXkD5gIOk,389360,396319,the m2 is about 12 faster single core and about 17 faster multi-core now this 
srnXkD5gIOk,396320,402320,single core score is the best out of any laptop ever and we're on battery power 
srnXkD5gIOk,402320,407360,so now let's go ahead and switch over to speedometer 2.0 here this is going to 
srnXkD5gIOk,407360,411439,test the snappiness of the system it loads up stuff in your web browser when 
srnXkD5gIOk,411440,416240,you're you know surfing the web using uh google docs all that kind of stuff all 
srnXkD5gIOk,416240,419919,right that is record breaking right there 
srnXkD5gIOk,419920,426160,408 i dare you go around your computer whatever you guys have that is crazy now 
srnXkD5gIOk,426160,430720,338 is extremely high as well apple's been updating so far we have the latest 
srnXkD5gIOk,430720,436800,software so this has gone a lot faster since it came out but 408 it's almost 
srnXkD5gIOk,436800,442720,double some of the best processors from amd and intel now graphics is where the 
srnXkD5gIOk,442720,447920,m2 should be a lot better let's go ahead and run our metal test because it has 
srnXkD5gIOk,447920,453520,two extra cores we're going from eight cores to 10 gpu cores now this might be 
srnXkD5gIOk,453520,457120,the only reason to get an m2 macbook pro 
srnXkD5gIOk,457120,460720,look at that we have 30 842 
srnXkD5gIOk,460720,467440,compared to 21.5 that is uh over 43 percent faster bigger more of an 
srnXkD5gIOk,467440,472640,improvement than what apple even showed off on stage at least for compute tasks 
srnXkD5gIOk,472640,476880,very very good and now let's push the graphics to the extreme with 3d marks 
srnXkD5gIOk,476880,482640,wildlife the graphics chips are maxed out right now there it is we have 41 
srnXkD5gIOk,482640,489040,frames per second compared to 30 frames per second that's a difference of 36.6 
srnXkD5gIOk,489040,494960,once again slightly better than what apple showed on stage so as far as a gpu 
srnXkD5gIOk,494960,499840,it's looking pretty good and now let's really push these cpus to their limits 
srnXkD5gIOk,499840,504480,with cinebench now i also have our power metrics open so we can see 
srnXkD5gIOk,504480,509120,exactly what's going on we can see our fan speeds and we are going to do the 10 
srnXkD5gIOk,509120,513200,minute throttling test so we've been running for about a minute now and we're 
srnXkD5gIOk,513200,521280,at 85 degrees celsius on the m1 and 93 degrees celsius 94 now on the m2 chip 
srnXkD5gIOk,521280,526400,now it is running at 200 megahertz higher in the efficiency cores this is 
srnXkD5gIOk,526400,530880,one thing we didn't notice before those are running close to about 400 megahertz 
srnXkD5gIOk,530880,534720,higher so of course we have four performance cores for efficiency cores 
srnXkD5gIOk,534720,540639,so those kick up more so now as far as our wattage we are running at an average 
srnXkD5gIOk,540640,547840,of about 16.7 about 20 watts and on the m1 15. so that's a 5 watt difference 
srnXkD5gIOk,547840,552320,pretty significant and check this out our fans on the m1 are already running 
srnXkD5gIOk,552320,555920,at 2300 they're kicking up they kicked up 
srnXkD5gIOk,555920,560800,earlier probably about maybe 10 20 seconds earlier than the m2 even though 
srnXkD5gIOk,560800,565279,the system is running cooler this is already in 99 it was just at 100 
srnXkD5gIOk,565280,568400,compared to i don't know what is this at here for 
srnXkD5gIOk,568400,572640,the top the highest core is at 91. so the fan 
srnXkD5gIOk,572640,577120,curves are definitely different apple did intentionally make this thing run 
srnXkD5gIOk,577120,581920,hotter and the fans kick in slower and later than the m1 all right guys we are 
srnXkD5gIOk,581920,587600,halfway done and our m1 is running out 4200 rpm 4300 compared to hovering about 
srnXkD5gIOk,587600,594560,3600 with a 98 degrees celsius compared to 89 it's a pretty significant 
srnXkD5gIOk,594560,600160,difference we now hit 101 and in our previous video it actually hit up to 104 
srnXkD5gIOk,600160,604879,degrees and right now we have cold ac just pumping into the room so it's 
srnXkD5gIOk,604880,610480,giving these a little bit of an advantage all right we are done in we 
srnXkD5gIOk,610480,616800,have a difference of almost exactly a thousand points now keep in mind these 
srnXkD5gIOk,616800,622000,monitoring tools do use a little bit of power but this shows us a 13 
srnXkD5gIOk,622720,626240,improvement uh not the 18 that we've seen on stage 
srnXkD5gIOk,626800,633760,but also it shows us that the m2 chip uses 33 percent more power to get 13 
srnXkD5gIOk,633760,637120,more performance it's kind of like back in the day when i would overclock 
srnXkD5gIOk,637120,642400,computers and you give a lot more power for a small gain in performance now as 
srnXkD5gIOk,642400,649920,far as battery life let's do our first check over here we have 78 on m2 and 74 
srnXkD5gIOk,649920,655680,on the m1 i'm not sure how that works and why we're seeing the difference 
srnXkD5gIOk,655680,658560,because the brightness is the same screens are the same this is using more 
srnXkD5gIOk,658560,663200,power but we're also just getting into our tests that really pushed the system 
srnXkD5gIOk,663200,668160,now for you coders out there are you going to be seeing that 13 to 18 
srnXkD5gIOk,668160,672720,difference in performance let's go ahead and take a look with our xcode benchmark 
srnXkD5gIOk,672720,676959,all right we are done with a benchmark the m1 macbook pro took two minutes and 
srnXkD5gIOk,676960,683040,18 seconds and the m2 took two minutes and three seconds so that is 
srnXkD5gIOk,683040,688320,a gain of around 13 and now we are doing our logic test we 
srnXkD5gIOk,688320,692480,have both running right here this is a new logic benchmark you guys can go look 
srnXkD5gIOk,692480,697120,it up and unfortunately our m1 is actually running 
srnXkD5gIOk,697120,702160,faster or better it's handling more tracks we're running at 81 and here we 
srnXkD5gIOk,702160,706639,got close to finishing with 76 but it shut off now i don't know if it's a 
srnXkD5gIOk,706640,712320,background process maybe the ssd or i don't know what's going on uh but this 
srnXkD5gIOk,712320,717840,definitely shows us that the m2 is not a 13 or you know 18 improvement so if 
srnXkD5gIOk,717840,722480,you're doing music production unless you need that 24 gigabytes of ram fresher 
srnXkD5gIOk,722480,726639,plug-ins and you want to have this specific macbook i don't think it's 
srnXkD5gIOk,726640,730640,worth it and now we have adobe lightroom opened up for all the photo editors 
srnXkD5gIOk,730640,732880,we're also going to check out a different program 
srnXkD5gIOk,733520,737440,but as far as the editing experience i wouldn't expect to see much of a 
srnXkD5gIOk,737440,742640,difference with brushes or smoothness it's mostly cpu based now we also do use 
srnXkD5gIOk,742640,747200,ram but also the ssds to load up images so with the slower ssd 
srnXkD5gIOk,747760,751920,we possibly could see a difference now we're going to go ahead and render these 
srnXkD5gIOk,751920,757440,50 raw images they're high resolution and they have a bunch of effects bam we 
srnXkD5gIOk,757440,762960,are exporting and one difference with the m2 chip is that you can get up to 24 
srnXkD5gIOk,762960,766880,gigs of ram as i mentioned but the ram is actually faster as well so we'll see 
srnXkD5gIOk,766880,772320,how that plays into the results wow the m2 was just at 105 degrees celsius the 
srnXkD5gIOk,772320,776160,highest we've seen so far now the fans are starting to kick up and 
srnXkD5gIOk,776160,779759,um cool it off but it's also interesting that the m1 
srnXkD5gIOk,780320,785600,is beating it out take a look at that oh actually the m2 kicked in there at the 
srnXkD5gIOk,785600,788639,very end and beat it all right our test is done 
srnXkD5gIOk,789200,794800,our m1 macbook pro took two minutes and 18 seconds actually faster than we had 
srnXkD5gIOk,794800,799360,before thanks to software updates and the m2 was at exactly two minutes just 
srnXkD5gIOk,799360,804640,like i estimated in my previous video now with that said that gives us a 
srnXkD5gIOk,804640,808320,difference of 15 which sounds like you know a decent 
srnXkD5gIOk,808320,812480,respectable amount but personally i was expecting more because lightroom is very 
srnXkD5gIOk,812480,817360,ram dependent and cpu dependent and the ram in the new m2 is 50 
srnXkD5gIOk,818240,823760,faster it uses super fast ram uh but maybe because of the ssd or i don't know 
srnXkD5gIOk,823760,829360,why else the gain isn't that huge now we can go ahead and shut down lightroom and 
srnXkD5gIOk,829360,833200,i'm going to test out affinity photo because it is very well optimized and as 
srnXkD5gIOk,833200,837760,a benchmark now affinity uses way more gpu compared to lightroom it actually 
srnXkD5gIOk,837760,842160,uses mostly gpu and that's a good thing for the m2 because we have a difference 
srnXkD5gIOk,842160,846879,of 42 11 850 compared to 8 
srnXkD5gIOk,846880,853360,386 for the gpu score that is very impressive now on the cpu side we're 
srnXkD5gIOk,853360,859440,only seeing a difference of about 13 7 55 compared to 667 so the cp performance 
srnXkD5gIOk,859440,865600,trend is continuing on and now i opened up photoshop here i have some raw images 
srnXkD5gIOk,865600,869519,opened up that i'm going to use the super resolution tool which uses a ai 
srnXkD5gIOk,870080,873040,so it's going to use the neural engine and the m2 apple said that the 
srnXkD5gIOk,873680,877279,neural engine got 40 faster so let's take a look so we're 
srnXkD5gIOk,877280,882960,over halfway done and it looks like they are pretty much neck and neck wow the m1 
srnXkD5gIOk,882960,888400,is actually slightly beating out the m2 right now all right wow that was very 
srnXkD5gIOk,888400,893920,weird our m1 took a minute and 58 seconds but the m2 took two minutes and 
srnXkD5gIOk,893920,898800,15 seconds now at first they were neck and neck and then the m2 started getting 
srnXkD5gIOk,898800,904320,ahead and at the end all suddenly m1 won i don't know if it just writes all the 
srnXkD5gIOk,904320,907760,files at the end and these are some pretty massive high resolution files 
srnXkD5gIOk,907760,912160,that were made four times larger so maybe it's just because of the faster 
srnXkD5gIOk,912160,916639,ssd's writing at the end but that is pretty crazy and now it's time for all 
srnXkD5gIOk,916640,921040,of you 3d guys out there we have blender opened up the latest version we are 
srnXkD5gIOk,921040,927519,running using the gpu compute through cycles and let's go ahead and test out a 
srnXkD5gIOk,927520,934160,render on this tough party tug scene and finally we're done that took a while we 
srnXkD5gIOk,934160,939040,have seven minutes and two seconds compared to five minutes and 19 seconds 
srnXkD5gIOk,939040,944880,a difference of 32 now while that is decent it's not as 
srnXkD5gIOk,944880,949360,high as some we saw with you know for up to 42 other tests i don't think anybody 
srnXkD5gIOk,949360,953440,that's serious about doing high quality scenes like this is gonna want to get 
srnXkD5gIOk,953440,958160,the m2 especially if you have the m1 you really do want to go for an m1 pro or 
srnXkD5gIOk,958160,962720,max because sitting here waiting like this it's just taking way too long and 
srnXkD5gIOk,962720,967920,now finally on to video editing i have final cut pro opened up in front of me 
srnXkD5gIOk,967920,974399,and we have a 4k project here with some effects and some luts here and as far as 
srnXkD5gIOk,974400,977360,playback none of these are going to struggle this is pretty easy but i want 
srnXkD5gIOk,977360,982000,to see if we have a difference in how much cpu and gpu is needed to play this 
srnXkD5gIOk,982000,986480,back it's interesting the m2 is using less cpu but more gpu whereas the m1 is 
srnXkD5gIOk,986480,991600,using less gpu but more cpu all right let's go ahead and export this i want to 
srnXkD5gIOk,991600,996319,know does the m2 export faster apple even talk about 8k which means it has to 
srnXkD5gIOk,996320,1000560,have a higher frames per second to export so will it be faster for video 
srnXkD5gIOk,1000560,1006080,editing let's find out alright guys look at this they are exporting at the same 
srnXkD5gIOk,1006080,1007920,exact time 
srnXkD5gIOk,1008880,1014240,this is 4k h.265 this is the faster method to do it and the only difference 
srnXkD5gIOk,1014240,1019839,that we're seeing is that the m2 is only using about 77 of its gpu compared to 
srnXkD5gIOk,1019840,1024240,about 93 from the m1 so even though we have the extra graphics power unless 
srnXkD5gIOk,1024240,1029520,you're loading up enough effects and transitions and tough things you might 
srnXkD5gIOk,1029520,1033120,not see any difference whatsoever and this already has 
srnXkD5gIOk,1034000,1038240,film grain which takes quite a bit of power and two luts on this compressed 
srnXkD5gIOk,1038240,1041839,footage so for most people that are doing youtube youtube videos some more 
srnXkD5gIOk,1041839,1046559,simple stuff this is actually even the m1 is gonna be more than enough for you 
srnXkD5gIOk,1046560,1048319,and as far as export times well it looks 
srnXkD5gIOk,1048319,1053200,like they're gonna be identical all right guys i was wrong the m2 is faster 
srnXkD5gIOk,1053200,1057600,by two seconds two minutes 23 seconds compared to two minutes and 25 
srnXkD5gIOk,1058240,1061760,seconds so for a lot of people that's not gonna make a big difference but what 
srnXkD5gIOk,1061760,1065280,really stood out during the event was the fact that it supports prores 
srnXkD5gIOk,1065280,1069440,encoding and decoding now just like the ammon pro and max chips so let's go 
srnXkD5gIOk,1069440,1074559,ahead and open up a prores project here this is a bunch of prores raw footage it 
srnXkD5gIOk,1074560,1080800,has a color corrections applied it has a lut applied as well so this is fairly 
srnXkD5gIOk,1080800,1086720,easy for the max but if we take a look at the cpu usage on the m1 we're at 42 
srnXkD5gIOk,1086720,1091200,percent whereas on the m1 pro we're only at 14 
srnXkD5gIOk,1091200,1095679,that's because the prores decoders they are actually doing most of 
srnXkD5gIOk,1095680,1099600,the heavy lifting because of that it should be able to export this five 
srnXkD5gIOk,1099600,1103600,minute project quite a bit quicker so let's go ahead and see all right guys 
srnXkD5gIOk,1104160,1108240,this is utterly crazy 
srnXkD5gIOk,1108240,1114640,our m1 is 49 done right now 50 compared to 42 
srnXkD5gIOk,1115280,1119520,on the m2 chip i don't know what is going wrong 
srnXkD5gIOk,1120160,1123680,i don't know if the pro res engines aren't working properly yet i don't know 
srnXkD5gIOk,1123680,1126320,if we're waiting on software updates like we did when the 
srnXkD5gIOk,1126880,1130560,max youtube came out it took a month to get final cut to be updated 
srnXkD5gIOk,1131120,1136160,but yeah our one and a half year old m1 is beating 
srnXkD5gIOk,1136160,1141760,out the m2 chip so far all right guys our m1 finished and the m2 
srnXkD5gIOk,1142320,1146639,failed i don't know why i don't know if there's software updates we need to wait 
srnXkD5gIOk,1146640,1150320,for stuff but this is just crazy i know that we are going to do some more 
srnXkD5gIOk,1150320,1153679,testing on our next video we'll use davinci resolve so we can get some more 
srnXkD5gIOk,1153680,1158000,data we'll also use some other codecs but overall i'm quite a bit disappointed 
srnXkD5gIOk,1158000,1161200,we actually ran some other final contests off screen and the results were 
srnXkD5gIOk,1161200,1167039,the same so it does seem to be a lot more like the m 1.5 instead of the m2 
srnXkD5gIOk,1167040,1172560,even more than we thought now as far as battery life i want to mention that uh 
srnXkD5gIOk,1172560,1177360,we did have some technical difficulties as we were shooting this our m1 is at 23 
srnXkD5gIOk,1177360,1182640,percent our m2 is at 36 percent now we had to reinstall different applications 
srnXkD5gIOk,1182640,1185120,had crashes so we spent more time on the m1 
srnXkD5gIOk,1185840,1191440,but here's dave lee's uh excellent test he had he had it early from apple and 
srnXkD5gIOk,1191440,1195440,this time instead of just doing light he also has a heavy load so it does show 
srnXkD5gIOk,1195440,1199759,that under heavy load the m2 is actually worse than that one but under a light 
srnXkD5gIOk,1199760,1203520,load it is a little bit better because it has those efficiency cores that are 
srnXkD5gIOk,1203520,1209040,stronger it can rely on those more often so thanks dave lee um and overall i just 
srnXkD5gIOk,1209040,1213520,have to say i'm a little bit more disappointed than i even was during the 
srnXkD5gIOk,1213520,1218480,announcement just because the ssds are half the speed for the read that is 
srnXkD5gIOk,1218480,1223520,insane for a product that came out a year and a half later in 2022 
srnXkD5gIOk,1223520,1226720,and then some of the other things that we were expecting the gains just aren't 
srnXkD5gIOk,1226720,1231120,that good i think if apple would have put in maybe a magsafe connector a 
srnXkD5gIOk,1231120,1234880,better webcam maybe dual fans like we used to have i mentioned at the 
srnXkD5gIOk,1234880,1236880,beginning in the 13-inch high-ren model 
srnXkD5gIOk,1237440,1240480,then it would run really quiet really cool 
srnXkD5gIOk,1241040,1245120,uh and we'd have a noticeable kind of worthwhile upgrade but at this point 
srnXkD5gIOk,1245120,1250720,either get a refurbished one save a ton of money maybe a used m1 m1 macbook air 
srnXkD5gIOk,1250720,1255039,or if you need performance go for that 14 inch we're gonna do a full comparison
