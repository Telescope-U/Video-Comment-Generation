nUZCE40n2zg,18000,19439,famous chef in the world that's not
nUZCE40n2zg,19439,20880,gonna happen but it turns out he has

nUZCE40n2zg,54960,57440,echo and as we walk back this is all for
nUZCE40n2zg,57440,60000,me and then

nUZCE40n2zg,102000,103840,breakfast is gordon ramsay burger zane
nUZCE40n2zg,103840,105200,here i guess we could call you our
nUZCE40n2zg,105200,106880,handler for the day because manny's been
nUZCE40n2zg,106880,108720,acting up it became quickly clear to me
nUZCE40n2zg,108720,110399,that gordon ramsay burger just basically
nUZCE40n2zg,110399,112399,had a bunch of fancy hamburger and i'm
nUZCE40n2zg,112399,114000,definitely not complaining they also let
nUZCE40n2zg,114000,115280,me work the girl in the back for a
nUZCE40n2zg,115280,116880,little bit if this was secretly a test
nUZCE40n2zg,116880,118799,by gordon i'm pretty sure i nailed it so
nUZCE40n2zg,118799,120399,we are here at breakfast i guess you
nUZCE40n2zg,120399,121520,could kind of call it a lunch because

nUZCE40n2zg,123280,125439,are gonna be eating the entire day first
nUZCE40n2zg,125439,127280,up we have this scramble sandwich which
nUZCE40n2zg,127280,129119,basically looks to be gordon's famous
nUZCE40n2zg,129119,130720,scrambled egg there we are the perfect
nUZCE40n2zg,130720,132400,scrambled egg nestled in some buttery

nUZCE40n2zg,140959,142879,excited for personally his sticky toffee
nUZCE40n2zg,142879,144160,pudding french toast which i'm going to
nUZCE40n2zg,144160,146480,dip in both sauces

nUZCE40n2zg,148879,150800,oh now we have our breakfast drink

nUZCE40n2zg,156800,157920,nick today
nUZCE40n2zg,157920,159680,after trying everything it was time to
nUZCE40n2zg,159680,161760,let manny have abbott i told him to pace
nUZCE40n2zg,161760,163440,himself for the day but he didn't really
nUZCE40n2zg,163440,164959,listen we're gonna have to roll manny
nUZCE40n2zg,164959,166480,out in a wheelchair i can't drive there
nUZCE40n2zg,166480,167760,the winning starts in three and a half
nUZCE40n2zg,167760,169760,hours so that was a fantastic breakfast
nUZCE40n2zg,169760,171440,my favorite was easily the scrambled
nUZCE40n2zg,171440,172640,sandwich gordon is known for his
nUZCE40n2zg,172640,174400,scrambled eggs next up we have gordon
nUZCE40n2zg,174400,176480,ramsay fish and chips early lunch gordon
nUZCE40n2zg,176480,178159,ramsay fish and chips is clearly one of
nUZCE40n2zg,178159,179599,those spots that gordon brought back
nUZCE40n2zg,179599,181120,from home and i think it's awesome that
nUZCE40n2zg,181120,182480,he brought a restaurant like this to the
nUZCE40n2zg,182480,185519,us what the are you doing it's good
nUZCE40n2zg,185519,187120,so first up we have this lobster fish
nUZCE40n2zg,187120,188640,and chips and i will say it smells
nUZCE40n2zg,188640,190080,fantastic i'm going to give it a nice
nUZCE40n2zg,190080,191840,squeeze of lemon then dip it into some
nUZCE40n2zg,191840,194400,oh shoot then dip it into both sausage
nUZCE40n2zg,194400,195680,and crunch
nUZCE40n2zg,195680,197519,next up we have classic fish and chips
nUZCE40n2zg,197519,201200,sandwich with this curried sauce
nUZCE40n2zg,203440,204879,this sauce right here is basically a
nUZCE40n2zg,204879,206640,really good curried mayonnaise and my
nUZCE40n2zg,206640,208239,guess is that it's something classic for
nUZCE40n2zg,208239,210080,fish and chips in the uk and i love it
nUZCE40n2zg,210080,211680,it's something i've never had before but
nUZCE40n2zg,211680,213440,it's delicious the last bite here is a
nUZCE40n2zg,213440,215360,biscoff milkshake everyone knows those
nUZCE40n2zg,215360,216879,cookies they give you on planes and i'm
nUZCE40n2zg,216879,218480,going to dive in
nUZCE40n2zg,218480,220000,easily my favorite thing there was that
nUZCE40n2zg,220000,221599,curried sauce benji can you check on the
nUZCE40n2zg,221599,223040,screen if that's traditional because i'm
nUZCE40n2zg,223040,226080,super curious
nUZCE40n2zg,226080,228159,but next where are we going
nUZCE40n2zg,228159,230239,we're going to gordon ramsay pub
nUZCE40n2zg,230239,232480,what is that mix like me and you so
nUZCE40n2zg,232480,234080,before we head to the next restaurant we
nUZCE40n2zg,234080,235840,have a little surprise the roof scene
nUZCE40n2zg,235840,237360,from the hangover manny and i are going
nUZCE40n2zg,237360,240920,to recreate it
nUZCE40n2zg,242270,245959,[Music]
nUZCE40n2zg,250159,252080,next we pulled up to gordon ramsay pub
nUZCE40n2zg,252080,253599,i'll be honest i'm not the biggest fan
nUZCE40n2zg,253599,255040,of beer because for some reason it
nUZCE40n2zg,255040,257120,really hurts my stomach nerd but i've
nUZCE40n2zg,257120,259040,never been opposed to good old bar food
nUZCE40n2zg,259040,260799,and that's exactly what gordon ramsay
nUZCE40n2zg,260799,262960,pubs seems to be here we naturally had
nUZCE40n2zg,262960,264960,to get some traditional pub food first
nUZCE40n2zg,264960,266720,off i'm going to dive into the short rib
nUZCE40n2zg,266720,268400,grilled cheese which i have to say looks
nUZCE40n2zg,268400,270320,delicious i may dip it in just a little
nUZCE40n2zg,270320,273440,bit of mustard and then
nUZCE40n2zg,273600,275360,next up these are called the hellfire
nUZCE40n2zg,275360,277280,wings now just by the name that sounds
nUZCE40n2zg,277280,278720,pretty spicy and we all know my heat
nUZCE40n2zg,278720,280720,tolerance is not very good drums are
nUZCE40n2zg,280720,283280,still better than wings yummy
nUZCE40n2zg,283280,284800,that's basically barbecue sauce with
nUZCE40n2zg,284800,286240,maybe a little bit of hot sauce in there
nUZCE40n2zg,286240,287600,you would all be very proud of me to
nUZCE40n2zg,287600,289360,know that my heat tolerance has gone up
nUZCE40n2zg,289360,290880,i can handle this last but not least
nUZCE40n2zg,290880,292639,this is quite creative we have kettle
nUZCE40n2zg,292639,294479,chip nachos i'm having a lot of cheese
nUZCE40n2zg,294479,296000,today man i'm gonna need that lactose
nUZCE40n2zg,296000,296800,bill
nUZCE40n2zg,296800,298240,the thing about bar food is you usually
nUZCE40n2zg,298240,300400,think of it like pizza or nachos but
nUZCE40n2zg,300400,302000,they make really creative takes on all
nUZCE40n2zg,302000,303520,that stuff this is french onion soup
nUZCE40n2zg,303520,306479,made with ale pretty clever
nUZCE40n2zg,306479,308000,we're gonna get as many stinky toffee
nUZCE40n2zg,308000,309680,puddings as we can today so here comes
nUZCE40n2zg,309680,311360,our first bite the best way i can
nUZCE40n2zg,311360,312560,describe this if you've never had it
nUZCE40n2zg,312560,315440,before is basically a really soft fluffy

nUZCE40n2zg,509280,510720,this one is totally different and i
nUZCE40n2zg,510720,512000,always like to say you have to get the
nUZCE40n2zg,512000,513518,well-rounded bite with a little bit of
nUZCE40n2zg,513518,514880,everything on the plate
nUZCE40n2zg,514880,517760,vodka is just so incredibly rich fatty
nUZCE40n2zg,517760,518880,and it's always great when it's cut with
nUZCE40n2zg,518880,520320,something acidic like orange because
nUZCE40n2zg,520320,522399,oftentimes acidity and fat go super
nUZCE40n2zg,522399,523839,super well together they balance each
nUZCE40n2zg,523839,525440,other out just like me and man so here
nUZCE40n2zg,525440,526959,we have our large selfish platter for
nUZCE40n2zg,526959,528480,you this evening
nUZCE40n2zg,528480,530240,i love myself a good seafood
nUZCE40n2zg,530240,531360,platter i'm gonna try a little bit of
nUZCE40n2zg,531360,532480,everything first i'm gonna try this big
nUZCE40n2zg,532480,534160, piece of king crab it looks nice
nUZCE40n2zg,534160,536399,and fresh look at this shrimp oh that
nUZCE40n2zg,536399,538000,was good manny's living large
nUZCE40n2zg,538000,539839,today let's do some oysters through this
nUZCE40n2zg,539839,541920, lemon little lemon in here

nUZCE40n2zg,543600,544640,out we got a little bit of like hot
nUZCE40n2zg,544640,545680,sauce right here i'm gonna put some of
nUZCE40n2zg,545680,547360,this on the moisture keep doing you're
nUZCE40n2zg,547360,548480,fired get out
nUZCE40n2zg,548480,549680,i'm not sure what manny just said to you
nUZCE40n2zg,549680,551200,about the seafood tower i'm gonna kindly
nUZCE40n2zg,551200,552640,advise you don't listen to any of it
nUZCE40n2zg,552640,554240,with that said i love a good seafood
nUZCE40n2zg,554240,556240,tower however my one complaint can often
nUZCE40n2zg,556240,557839,be that if things are directly touching
nUZCE40n2zg,557839,559519,the ice they get super cold and hard to
nUZCE40n2zg,559519,561360,bite through so my advice to any of you
nUZCE40n2zg,561360,563040,ever making a seafood tower is make sure
nUZCE40n2zg,563040,564240,there's something separating the seafood
nUZCE40n2zg,564240,565600,from the actual ice this thing right
nUZCE40n2zg,565600,567279,here though i'm excited to eat this i'm
nUZCE40n2zg,567279,569040,a big fan of crudo and this here is a
nUZCE40n2zg,569040,570880,hamachi crudo i can see it's got a
nUZCE40n2zg,570880,572640,pretty big chili or pepper on the top
nUZCE40n2zg,572640,574240,and again i'm trying to up my spice
nUZCE40n2zg,574240,575519,tolerance a little bit let's see how
nUZCE40n2zg,575519,576480,spicy
nUZCE40n2zg,576480,578080,it depends how you bite down in the
nUZCE40n2zg,578080,579760,pepper and how the pepper hits your
nUZCE40n2zg,579760,581600,tongue sometimes my strategy for spicy
nUZCE40n2zg,581600,583279,stuff is to not bite too much into the
nUZCE40n2zg,583279,584800,pepper and swallow it and then just my
nUZCE40n2zg,584800,587040,stomach hurts not my mouth naturally we
nUZCE40n2zg,587040,588560,are all very excited for the beef
nUZCE40n2zg,588560,590480,wellington and it's also got a fat piece
nUZCE40n2zg,590480,592560,of lobster tail on top which is even
nUZCE40n2zg,592560,594800,better
nUZCE40n2zg,594959,596080,i feel like there's a little bit of
nUZCE40n2zg,596080,597680,black truffle on the top of that and
nUZCE40n2zg,597680,599519,frankly having that lobster and the beef
nUZCE40n2zg,599519,601440,wellington together is super decadent
nUZCE40n2zg,601440,603040,i'm gonna rate this meatballington over
nUZCE40n2zg,603040,604240,the beef wellington that we had at
nUZCE40n2zg,604240,606000,ramsay's kitchen back in boston when
nUZCE40n2zg,606000,607440,gordon challenged me to bring it on
nUZCE40n2zg,607440,609120,bring it on big boy next up we got our
nUZCE40n2zg,609120,611040,tomahawk and i can smell from this thing
nUZCE40n2zg,611040,612959,that it's dry aged
nUZCE40n2zg,612959,614720,it dries this for about a month and the
nUZCE40n2zg,614720,616640,entire flavor profile and smell of the
nUZCE40n2zg,616640,618160,whole thing changes based on that i'm
nUZCE40n2zg,618160,619680,gonna eat this tomahawk the best way you
nUZCE40n2zg,619680,622959,can eat any tama right off the boat
nUZCE40n2zg,622959,624959,and you want a bite yeah that's really
nUZCE40n2zg,624959,626800,good before our final dish our final
nUZCE40n2zg,626800,628240,dessert of the day the sticky toffee
nUZCE40n2zg,628240,629760,pudding for the third time in a row
nUZCE40n2zg,629760,631040,let's have a little bit of that smoky
nUZCE40n2zg,631040,633040,chipotle mac and cheese
nUZCE40n2zg,633040,634399,because this is our third and final
nUZCE40n2zg,634399,635680,sticky toffee pudding of the day they're
nUZCE40n2zg,635680,637440,gonna let me do the honors and pour on
nUZCE40n2zg,637440,639680,that beautiful sauce oh look at that and
nUZCE40n2zg,639680,641760,this is brown butter ice cream in the
nUZCE40n2zg,641760,643360,shape of a stick of butter we'll go
nUZCE40n2zg,643360,645040,ahead and we'll place that right on top
nUZCE40n2zg,645040,647120,beautiful and a little bit more of that
nUZCE40n2zg,647120,649519,sauce perfect the final bite of the day
nUZCE40n2zg,649519,650880,i don't even know how many dishes we've
nUZCE40n2zg,650880,652079,had today but i'm sure we can put a
nUZCE40n2zg,652079,653200,count right in the bottom of the screen
nUZCE40n2zg,653200,654880,here the sticky toffee pudding we've had
nUZCE40n2zg,654880,656399,three today so i'm also really just
nUZCE40n2zg,656399,658320,curious to see which one wins
nUZCE40n2zg,658320,660399,i think on both taste and presentation
nUZCE40n2zg,660399,661680,we have to give this one the win
nUZCE40n2zg,661680,663120,especially with that stick of butter
nUZCE40n2zg,663120,664959,that's in the flavor of brown butter ice
nUZCE40n2zg,664959,666320,cream brown butter is probably one of my
nUZCE40n2zg,666320,667839,favorite things out there it's time for
