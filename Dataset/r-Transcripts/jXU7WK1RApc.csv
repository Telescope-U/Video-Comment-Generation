jXU7WK1RApc,352479,358479,doing over there origami that can be  pretty neat i know but you have to make  sure to fold the paper just right i
jXU7WK1RApc,358479,364319,started with a center fold like this  then again the other way open it up pull  down both the corners good then the
jXU7WK1RApc,364319,370240,bottom flap needs to come up on both  sides yeah this is going great so far i  love folding paper these popped up
jXU7WK1RApc,370240,377039,corners need to go back down corners  over here too just a little more getting  closer these sides both have to fold up
jXU7WK1RApc,377039,383680,there i did it i made a little boat out  of my piece of paper what do you think  do you like it there perfect a pair of
jXU7WK1RApc,383680,389360,little paper sails for my boat but how  is it for dance  oh because a boat dances along the waves
jXU7WK1RApc,389360,394560,as it sails wait what that's seriously  what you're going with that's totally  not gonna work
jXU7WK1RApc,394560,399600,she's right see the picture is on a  ballerina not a boat
jXU7WK1RApc,399600,406240,okay fine but i think i can still do  something with origami are are you just  making another boat because again won't

jXU7WK1RApc,424960,431680,how are you doing that  you're going so fast it's hard to keep  up yes i'm done i made a beautiful rose
jXU7WK1RApc,431680,438560,for you  it's so lovely i can't believe you made  this for me  but what the heck am i gonna do
jXU7WK1RApc,438560,444560,i know i just need to start over with my  folds i'm gonna use the edge of this  ruler to help keep my folds crisp this
jXU7WK1RApc,444560,450479,part is a bit tricky gotta pop it out  like this and on the other side too okay  i need to add some artwork just gotta
jXU7WK1RApc,450479,456639,draw a cute little ballerina on my paper  she's so cute okay but i need to draw  other parts too gotta make sure she
jXU7WK1RApc,456639,461759,still has her face and hands here and  then do the same on the other side too  once i'm done up there i need to do the
jXU7WK1RApc,461759,468020,same thing with her like flaps i think  i'll give her some colors so she's  prettier but i can't forget to color it  on each of the flaps
jXU7WK1RApc,468020,473840,[Music]  and i think i'll finish her outfit with
jXU7WK1RApc,473840,480319,a bluetooth too that's cute blue over  here and blue over there yes i'm  finished with mine
jXU7WK1RApc,480319,486639,here let me show you how it works if i  take the flaps and fold them up and down  i can make her dance
jXU7WK1RApc,486639,497360,look at her go so beautiful  [Music]  whoa wow what a spectacular job you win
jXU7WK1RApc,497360,504479,yes i knew i would  but  i wonder what it is i'm so excited
jXU7WK1RApc,504479,509840,it's kind of disappointing so far  i know right  uh
jXU7WK1RApc,509840,516000,what's that noise  surprise  still nothing
jXU7WK1RApc,516000,522080,hello we're waiting  whoa that was pretty cool
jXU7WK1RApc,522080,527120,wow should we open it  uh well it's mine
jXU7WK1RApc,527120,532839,hey hand it over it was my idea don't  grab  you're so mean
jXU7WK1RApc,532839,539760,chris ooh bubbles  i don't care  but they are pretty
jXU7WK1RApc,539760,547279,can i try  no  please  it's so fun
jXU7WK1RApc,547279,553440,hey look at that  this gives me idea  this'll be so good
jXU7WK1RApc,553440,558640,start with a canvas  then use a roller to apply paint
jXU7WK1RApc,558640,564560,make sure to cover the whole canvas  now take a coffee cup and dip it into
jXU7WK1RApc,564560,571680,white paint  and press onto the canvas  be as creative as you want
jXU7WK1RApc,571680,579200,next start to add color inside the  circles  try to add different colors for a more  realistic effect
jXU7WK1RApc,579920,586720,we're trying to capture the light in the  bubbles  this is looking good
jXU7WK1RApc,586720,593200,and now for some finer details  this turned out amazing
jXU7WK1RApc,593200,599680,i'm so artistic  hey chris i have some bubbles of my own
jXU7WK1RApc,599680,607120,what  jealous  can i have it let's swap give me it wow
jXU7WK1RApc,607120,612800,huh where's the bubbles it's empty  that's not fair oh
jXU7WK1RApc,612800,620480,did i forget to tell you i used all the  bubbles it's not funny  i've got a good feeling about this one
jXU7WK1RApc,620480,627600,a love heart it's so cute let's see who  spins the wheel  i'm great at thumb wars
jXU7WK1RApc,627600,634190,yes i won  oh so  close please don't be bad
jXU7WK1RApc,634190,639360,[Music]  no paper
jXU7WK1RApc,639519,644560,but how am i supposed to draw  guess you'll need to figure that out
jXU7WK1RApc,644560,650000,watch this  i'll start by drawing a line down the  middle
jXU7WK1RApc,650000,658000,and another one  then some lines at the top and bottom
jXU7WK1RApc,658160,664640,and now for the sides of the heart  the pencil makes great guidelines for
jXU7WK1RApc,664640,670399,when we start to use ink  [Music]  once the basic shape is done use an
jXU7WK1RApc,670399,676240,eraser to remove the guidelines around  the edges  then grab a pen and just follow the
jXU7WK1RApc,676240,682000,lines it creates a great 3d effect  now to add the color remember to stay
jXU7WK1RApc,682000,687920,inside the lines  once that's done add shadowing to the  inside edges a regular pencil is fine
jXU7WK1RApc,687920,691830,for this  [Music]
jXU7WK1RApc,693120,699279,just add to anywhere you think there  would be a shadow or where you think the  light would be different
jXU7WK1RApc,699519,704720,it's a different way of drawing a love  heart but it looks so impressive
jXU7WK1RApc,705360,713200,that's it  what do you think  wow i mean it's okay what can i use i
jXU7WK1RApc,713200,719839,know my hands  it's pretty basic  there must be something i can do
jXU7WK1RApc,719839,725440,got it a tiny heart huh how about this
jXU7WK1RApc,726320,731680,it's a heart  no it isn't
jXU7WK1RApc,731680,737680,sorry  okay now what do you think  ah just give up
jXU7WK1RApc,737680,745279,i know i can do this come on fingers  don't let me down i think i figured it  out i just need a red pen
jXU7WK1RApc,745279,752000,place one finger on top of the other  then draw a love heart  then simply use a red pen to fill it in
jXU7WK1RApc,752000,757519,it's not too bad i like it or should i  say i love it
jXU7WK1RApc,757519,763200,but i'm not finished  let's add a smiley face
jXU7WK1RApc,763760,769440,and you need another one for true love  how romantic
jXU7WK1RApc,769440,777440,look  seriously oh that's so cute hold on i  have an idea too don't ruin it
jXU7WK1RApc,777440,783839,it'll be great  there they're hugging  i think i'm gonna cry
jXU7WK1RApc,783839,790720,it's so sweet  [Music]
jXU7WK1RApc,790720,798160,care to go for a swim with the fish  oh definitely the ideas are flowing that
jXU7WK1RApc,798160,805360,makes one of us  how is gina so good at drawing fish
jXU7WK1RApc,808240,815190,hey gina a ghost  there what
jXU7WK1RApc,815190,822240,[Music]  oh you're in for it david i won't let  this dampen my spirit
jXU7WK1RApc,822720,829279,a real artist can create something out  of anything this design can totally work  it's all about thinking outside of the
jXU7WK1RApc,829279,836240,box or well the fish tank in this case  and they don't all have to be the same
jXU7WK1RApc,837360,842199,they each have their own style see
jXU7WK1RApc,843279,849279,but a little color can really make the  fish  come alive
jXU7WK1RApc,849279,857720,see how i'm using my line technique just  fill in the scales that way too the  outline keeps everything in place
jXU7WK1RApc,859360,864720,now i'll use the same technique on the  other two fish but with different  designs you have to change the color
jXU7WK1RApc,864720,870240,scheme and this bad boy is going mellow  yellow but a dash of purple will really  make him stand out they are
jXU7WK1RApc,870240,876800,complementary colors after all but  turquoise is always my favorite that's  why i saved the best for last orange
jXU7WK1RApc,876800,883199,always goes nicely with blue what should  i use for the middle color yellow of  course it really brings it all together
jXU7WK1RApc,883199,889860,doesn't it color plays a huge part in  this piece makes it really eye-catching  fish really are fun that way
jXU7WK1RApc,889860,898440,[Music]  almost forgot about the bubbles
jXU7WK1RApc,899040,907600,all done  give me those fish  may as well give me first place
jXU7WK1RApc,907920,913600,i guess it's all right  how about yours gina you mean these old
jXU7WK1RApc,913600,919040,things  very nice
jXU7WK1RApc,919040,924399,well that plan sure backfired  [Music]
jXU7WK1RApc,924399,930720,recognize this thing it swims and quacks  see  [Music]
jXU7WK1RApc,930720,937519,we're doing ducks now  wait i got it
jXU7WK1RApc,937519,943839,david check out those birds hey guys  of course
jXU7WK1RApc,943839,949040,start by tracing your hand like this  then add on a tail like shape and a
jXU7WK1RApc,949040,956480,connecting line like this  then another one over  here move to the tail next
jXU7WK1RApc,956480,963360,now for the little ducky face  what's a bird without a beak and in my  world birds are all kinds of vibrant
jXU7WK1RApc,963360,967639,colors kind of like peacocks
jXU7WK1RApc,970240,974480,look at all that gorgeous solid color
jXU7WK1RApc,976000,981360,and what goes really good with pink you  ask yellow of course
