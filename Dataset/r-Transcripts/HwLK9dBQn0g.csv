HwLK9dBQn0g,3048,4900,If you want to start to feel happy
HwLK9dBQn0g,5246,8142,it starts with you wanting to feel happy.
HwLK9dBQn0g,9924,11800,"We like to sit and dwell,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,11825,14313,We like to sit in our own sadness.
HwLK9dBQn0g,15038,18133,Make sure you’re spending time every single day
HwLK9dBQn0g,18252,21260,"whether it’s 15-20 minutes, whether it’s an hour - two hours."
HwLK9dBQn0g,21538,23467,Take time to allow your mind
HwLK9dBQn0g,23752,25700,separation from the stresses of your day.
HwLK9dBQn0g,26509,27723,If you expect to fail
HwLK9dBQn0g,27748,28882,you will fail.
HwLK9dBQn0g,29239,31900,"On the other hand if you expect to win, you will win."
HwLK9dBQn0g,32106,34467,"And he’s right, because doctors and psychologists both alike"
HwLK9dBQn0g,34492,37472,they agree that worrying actually does shorten your life
HwLK9dBQn0g,37888,39150,and it does damage your body.
HwLK9dBQn0g,39650,42033,We need to clear our thinking before we go to sleep.
HwLK9dBQn0g,42780,45933,We're talking about a book that Norman Vincent Peal wrote
HwLK9dBQn0g,46359,47933,"“The Power of Positive Thinking."""
HwLK9dBQn0g,55995,58032,Let’s kick this off with golden nugget number one:
HwLK9dBQn0g,58752,60704,Creating your own inner happiness.
HwLK9dBQn0g,61620,64476,That you are responsible for your own happiness
HwLK9dBQn0g,65463,69170,"because unhappiness is usually the byproduct of you thinking sad thoughts,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,69411,71333,"you having these negative feelings,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,71358,73333,you having resentment towards others
HwLK9dBQn0g,73628,76333,and just having an overall crappy outlook on life.
HwLK9dBQn0g,77790,79369,So if you think those things
HwLK9dBQn0g,79647,81087,what do you think is going to happen?
HwLK9dBQn0g,81615,85273,You have to force yourself to not think those negative thoughts.
HwLK9dBQn0g,87150,90067,"Peal says, we have to get into the happiness habit"
HwLK9dBQn0g,90317,92698,by thinking upbeat cheery thoughts throughout the day.
HwLK9dBQn0g,93582,95470,We like to sit and dwell.
HwLK9dBQn0g,95495,97939,We like to sit in our own sadness.
HwLK9dBQn0g,99133,99887,I don’t like to do that
HwLK9dBQn0g,99912,102134,but I just know that sometimes my brain forces me to do that
HwLK9dBQn0g,102158,102927,and I don’t know why.
HwLK9dBQn0g,102975,104697,So I have to force myself
HwLK9dBQn0g,104722,105975,to not do that.
HwLK9dBQn0g,106094,107411,"I have to put on upbeat music,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,107467,109730,"I have to do something productive, I have to get in the gym."
HwLK9dBQn0g,109754,111642,I have to go hang around friends that are gonna make me laugh.
HwLK9dBQn0g,111666,113547,And it’s tough. At first it doesn’t feel right.
HwLK9dBQn0g,113572,116033,It feels like you’re forcing it because you ARE forcing it
HwLK9dBQn0g,116564,118484,but eventually it starts to make you feel better.
HwLK9dBQn0g,120616,122323,There are miracles happening all around you.
HwLK9dBQn0g,122347,123990,There is beauty all around you.
HwLK9dBQn0g,124015,125667,Open your eyes and look.
HwLK9dBQn0g,126071,127600,Can you see the sun shining?
HwLK9dBQn0g,127625,128625,Great.
HwLK9dBQn0g,128672,130367,Can you hear the birds chirping?
HwLK9dBQn0g,130590,131487,Great.
HwLK9dBQn0g,131513,134567,Can you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin?
HwLK9dBQn0g,134591,135591,Awesome!
HwLK9dBQn0g,136147,138330,There’s simple beauties all around us.
HwLK9dBQn0g,138916,140916,"If you want to start to feel happy,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,141139,144043,it starts with you wanting to feel happy.
HwLK9dBQn0g,144996,146742,So short circuit those negative thoughts.
HwLK9dBQn0g,146767,149362,"And when you start to feel bad, when you start to find yourself gossiping"
HwLK9dBQn0g,149387,151140,"feeling guilty, feeling angry, feeling..."
HwLK9dBQn0g,151538,153427,"whatever it is you’re feeling that's negative,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,153927,155308,"turn that around,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,155649,157236,"force yourself to think positively,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,157261,158268,do positive things
HwLK9dBQn0g,158380,160468,"and while it doesn’t feel right at first,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,160912,161912,keep going!
HwLK9dBQn0g,161999,163133,You’re on the right path.
HwLK9dBQn0g,165555,166816,Golden nugget number two:
HwLK9dBQn0g,166976,168896,The antidote to anxiety
HwLK9dBQn0g,170137,172844,"is that people waste a lot of their time, a lot of their energy"
HwLK9dBQn0g,172869,175800,fuming and fretting about things that they cannot control.
HwLK9dBQn0g,176030,177340,Go back to Covey’s principle:
HwLK9dBQn0g,177641,179610,"circle of concern, circle of influence."
HwLK9dBQn0g,180213,182767,Focus only on those things in the circle of influence.
HwLK9dBQn0g,183263,185707,"Everything else in the circle of concern, you can’t control."
HwLK9dBQn0g,186001,187300,You can’t affect that.
HwLK9dBQn0g,188104,189104,So move on!
HwLK9dBQn0g,189518,191883,Don’t allow your mind to just spend time in that space.
HwLK9dBQn0g,192240,193767,You’re wasting your mind’s energy.
HwLK9dBQn0g,196648,198599,"So as part of this antidote to anxiety,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,198625,201053,Peal says that we need to slow down
HwLK9dBQn0g,201371,203600,to relieve our anxiety and to attain peace.
HwLK9dBQn0g,204189,205833,And he suggests meditation.
HwLK9dBQn0g,206951,209189,He suggests that we devote at least 15 minutes daily
HwLK9dBQn0g,209214,211102,to calming and relaxing ourselves
HwLK9dBQn0g,211190,212896,by thinking peaceful thoughts
HwLK9dBQn0g,213214,214733,or not thinking anything at all.
HwLK9dBQn0g,215729,219094,"So something he shares in the book, is to help get rid of the tendency to worry"
HwLK9dBQn0g,219119,220158,"and get angry,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,220365,221080,we need to relax
HwLK9dBQn0g,221105,224286,"and spend a few minutes thinking about beautiful, peaceful settings."
HwLK9dBQn0g,224536,227233,"Hearing the birds chirping, feeling the sun on our face."
HwLK9dBQn0g,227626,229363,All these things that I was talking about before
HwLK9dBQn0g,229387,232107,where it's just a matter of you actually thinking that in your mind.
HwLK9dBQn0g,232318,233333,Wherever you are.
HwLK9dBQn0g,233524,234524,"If you're at work,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,234889,236683,"if you're in your house, it doesn't..."
HwLK9dBQn0g,237540,238540,Close your eyes
HwLK9dBQn0g,238628,240009,and open your mind to
HwLK9dBQn0g,240034,241976,maybe a place where you're on vacation before
HwLK9dBQn0g,242660,244267,and go there for 15 minutes.
HwLK9dBQn0g,244675,245767,Smell the smells
HwLK9dBQn0g,245792,247767,"feel what the sand feels like on your feet,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,247831,250021,feel yourself plunging into the ocean.
HwLK9dBQn0g,251747,253191,So the antidote to anxiety
HwLK9dBQn0g,253216,254616,it's all about clearing your mind.
HwLK9dBQn0g,254685,256767,However you choose to do that
HwLK9dBQn0g,257337,260400,make sure you're spending time every single day
HwLK9dBQn0g,260670,262313,"whether it's 15-20 minutes,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,262338,264488,"whether it's an hour - two hours if you're working out at the gym,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,264489,266712,"whether you're doing yoga, whether you're going to cycling class,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,266736,267736,whatever.
HwLK9dBQn0g,267870,269941,Take time to allow your mind
HwLK9dBQn0g,270052,272033,separation from the stresses of your day.
HwLK9dBQn0g,273695,274957,Golden nugget number three:
HwLK9dBQn0g,275131,276632,Expect the best.
HwLK9dBQn0g,277956,279133,If you expect to fail
HwLK9dBQn0g,279163,280320,you will fail.
HwLK9dBQn0g,280671,282505,"On the other hand, if you expect to win"
HwLK9dBQn0g,282530,283530,you will win.
HwLK9dBQn0g,285188,287672,"So, what seeds are you planting in your mind?"
HwLK9dBQn0g,287943,291117,Are you planting seeds of positivity or seeds of negativity?
HwLK9dBQn0g,291724,292533,Guess what?
HwLK9dBQn0g,292558,295100,Your life is going to give you back more of that.
HwLK9dBQn0g,296252,298400,"Are you planting seeds of oh, doubt and"
HwLK9dBQn0g,298554,299879,"oh, I’m not gonna make this work"
HwLK9dBQn0g,299904,302000,or something bad is gonna happen?
HwLK9dBQn0g,302277,303627,If you're planting seeds of that
HwLK9dBQn0g,303652,305564,guess what you're gonna get? More of that.
HwLK9dBQn0g,307821,309400,Start focusing on the positive.
HwLK9dBQn0g,309464,311633,Start focusing on how things can go right
HwLK9dBQn0g,311726,313800,"and guess what, when things go wrong say, Hmm"
HwLK9dBQn0g,314218,315543,there's a lesson in that for me.
HwLK9dBQn0g,316597,318676,"Because life doesn't happen to me, it happens for me."
HwLK9dBQn0g,318758,320233,So everything that's happening
HwLK9dBQn0g,320282,321733,is there to teach me a lesson.
HwLK9dBQn0g,321948,324012,"This isn't a setback, it's a set up."
HwLK9dBQn0g,324313,326647,"This thing that's really bad, it happened for a reason."
HwLK9dBQn0g,326672,328512,I'm gonna learn from it. I’m gonna get better.
HwLK9dBQn0g,330286,331579,Golden nugget number four:
HwLK9dBQn0g,332056,333206,Worry not.
HwLK9dBQn0g,334318,336690,And he's right because doctors and psychologists both alike
HwLK9dBQn0g,336716,339567,they agree that worrying actually does shorten your life.
HwLK9dBQn0g,340090,341455,And it does damage your body.
HwLK9dBQn0g,342423,344677,We need to clear our thinking before we go to sleep
HwLK9dBQn0g,344702,346300,and we need to imagine our worries
HwLK9dBQn0g,346325,348667,flowing out of our body like water out of a glass.
HwLK9dBQn0g,349896,352199,"So don't think that my path is the right path. No, no."
HwLK9dBQn0g,353127,354467,This path is good for me.
HwLK9dBQn0g,357119,358919,I replaced worry with hope
HwLK9dBQn0g,359008,360484,by putting together goals.
HwLK9dBQn0g,360841,362047,I put together three goals:
HwLK9dBQn0g,362072,363134,"a financial related goal,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,363160,364287,"a health related goal,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,364390,365850,and a professional related goal.
HwLK9dBQn0g,365875,366629,Something that...
HwLK9dBQn0g,366716,368438,what I was going to do with my life.
HwLK9dBQn0g,369137,371932,"And back in the day when I was going through those stresses,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,371958,373232,I was worrying a lot.
HwLK9dBQn0g,373257,375805,"A lot. I was having a tough time sleeping, I was having chest pains,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,375829,377821,my heart was palpitating all the time
HwLK9dBQn0g,378694,380376,and I really just could not get
HwLK9dBQn0g,380685,382772,"you know, a high level of satisfaction in life"
HwLK9dBQn0g,382797,385505,"and you know if you were saying on a scale of one to eight, Ryan again,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,385529,387249,nines and tens are reserved for
HwLK9dBQn0g,387426,389878,very special times in our lives that seldom happen.
HwLK9dBQn0g,390505,392267,I was sitting at a four consistently.
HwLK9dBQn0g,393283,395711,Where I would wake up and I'd all of a sudden feel the stresses of the day.
HwLK9dBQn0g,395735,398029,I'd pass between three and four all the time.
HwLK9dBQn0g,398156,400291,"So what I did was to replace that worry,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,400316,401958,"that anxiety, that fear"
HwLK9dBQn0g,402370,404235,I built myself a plan that gave me hope.
HwLK9dBQn0g,404728,406173,Goals that gave me hope.
HwLK9dBQn0g,406649,407990,"Something that got me excited,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,408015,409516,"something that I wanted to work towards,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,409540,410668,something I wanted to achieve
HwLK9dBQn0g,410692,412929,because I knew that if I did it would get me out of this mess
HwLK9dBQn0g,412953,414593,and my life would be better as a result.
HwLK9dBQn0g,416842,418080,Golden nugget number five:
HwLK9dBQn0g,418326,419341,Problem solving.
HwLK9dBQn0g,420921,423279,I had problems that I needed solutions to.
HwLK9dBQn0g,424138,426733,"I had desires, I had wants,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,426758,429733,"I had dreams, I had goals that I needed a solution to."
HwLK9dBQn0g,431020,432576,The Cut the Crap show was a solution.
HwLK9dBQn0g,433401,434457,Create Your 8
HwLK9dBQn0g,434655,435663,was a solution
HwLK9dBQn0g,435933,439800,but what I did need to do was take myself out of the busyness of the day
HwLK9dBQn0g,440314,442258,and allow my mind to sort of free up
HwLK9dBQn0g,443187,445171,and look for inspiration all around me.
HwLK9dBQn0g,445671,446806,And know that
HwLK9dBQn0g,447306,449587,whatever solution I’m looking for it's going to come to me
HwLK9dBQn0g,450983,452433,and this is where in this
HwLK9dBQn0g,452825,456221,"golden nugget, in the book, where Peal talks about, you know, problem solving,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,456404,458444,he gives us 10 problem-solving techniques which
HwLK9dBQn0g,458864,460079,many of them I'm going to leave with.
HwLK9dBQn0g,460515,461515,The first one...
HwLK9dBQn0g,461610,463927,believe that for every problem there is a solution.
HwLK9dBQn0g,464309,466667,"So yes, believe that your problem can be solved."
HwLK9dBQn0g,466864,469524,"Yes it's hard, yes it's difficult, yes you don't have a solution right now"
HwLK9dBQn0g,469548,470555,but there IS a solution.
HwLK9dBQn0g,470580,472198,And oftentimes there's more than one.
HwLK9dBQn0g,472873,473682,Two:
HwLK9dBQn0g,473723,476095,Try to maintain your serenity as you address a problem.
HwLK9dBQn0g,476500,478223,"So, don't feel anxious,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,478381,481000,don't try to... don't try to- to get angry
HwLK9dBQn0g,481025,483585,"and say, ah you know I’m not getting this. I don't understand. No."
HwLK9dBQn0g,484136,485199,"You need to be calm,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,485612,486676,you need to be hopeful
HwLK9dBQn0g,487168,489248,that there's going to be a solution to this problem.
HwLK9dBQn0g,489945,490700,Number three:
HwLK9dBQn0g,490725,491985,Don't try to force an answer
HwLK9dBQn0g,492130,493433,"more so don't try to say like,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,493458,496590,"Oh my God, I need an answer by Saturday at noon"
HwLK9dBQn0g,496615,498869,if I don't get it by Saturday at noon then it's too late.
HwLK9dBQn0g,498893,500250,Sometimes you can't force it.
HwLK9dBQn0g,501091,502867,Life often happens for you.
HwLK9dBQn0g,503591,505067,And so you just need time
HwLK9dBQn0g,505092,506615,for that to reveal itself to you.
HwLK9dBQn0g,507236,509251,"Number four, gather all relevant information."
HwLK9dBQn0g,509284,510133,Pretty simple.
HwLK9dBQn0g,510213,511767,Do as much research as possible.
HwLK9dBQn0g,512109,514807,"Number five, write down all facts about the situation."
HwLK9dBQn0g,514833,517992,"Again, get an understanding for the problem, what's going on."
HwLK9dBQn0g,518017,519201,You need to get clarity on the problem
HwLK9dBQn0g,519224,521667,so you can get clear on what solutions you need to solve it.
HwLK9dBQn0g,522193,523026,Number six:
HwLK9dBQn0g,523052,525733,Spend time praying about the issue you are confronting.
HwLK9dBQn0g,526221,528293,"Listen, if you're praying about it, that's fine,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,528318,530357,"if you're not praying about it, maybe you're thinking about it."
HwLK9dBQn0g,530381,531865,Always make time to think about it.
HwLK9dBQn0g,532024,533445,When you're walking in nature
HwLK9dBQn0g,533572,537033,"yes, take time to think in nature and allow your mind to flow"
HwLK9dBQn0g,537083,538181,but when you separate yourself
HwLK9dBQn0g,538205,540583,"from the stresses, the anxieties, the busyness of the day"
HwLK9dBQn0g,540608,542600,allow your time to think about solutions.
HwLK9dBQn0g,543094,544023,"Number seven,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,544087,546324,believe in and seek God's guidance
HwLK9dBQn0g,546350,548785,on the promise of the 73rd Psalm:
HwLK9dBQn0g,549009,551800,Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel.
HwLK9dBQn0g,552993,556112,"Again, if you believe in the religious aspect of that, that will talk to you."
HwLK9dBQn0g,556271,558067,That necessarily doesn't talk to me.
HwLK9dBQn0g,558612,560933,"So I, I maybe won't be using that one."
HwLK9dBQn0g,561842,564961,"Number eight, rely on your inner gifts of insight and intuition."
HwLK9dBQn0g,565496,567800,There's things that we believe we should do
HwLK9dBQn0g,568575,571567,and then there's things that we know we should be doing.
HwLK9dBQn0g,572911,574111,So you gotta listen to yourself
HwLK9dBQn0g,574135,575420,"but it takes time, it takes..."
HwLK9dBQn0g,575445,577905,"it does take time, it takes patience, it takes some maturity"
HwLK9dBQn0g,578128,579769,for you to realize what you're great at.

HwLK9dBQn0g,659308,660784,"if a loved one passed away,"
HwLK9dBQn0g,661133,662070,"a friend,"
