iWaXjgDEfj0,33040,40399,uh  where'd you go  did you know our five basic senses help
iWaXjgDEfj0,40399,46719,us experience the world around us humans  have five
iWaXjgDEfj0,46719,52399,basic senses can you guess what they are  number one
iWaXjgDEfj0,52399,57559,we have a sense of touch
iWaXjgDEfj0,62320,67360,number two  we have a sense of
iWaXjgDEfj0,67360,74080,taste  number three
iWaXjgDEfj0,74080,80720,smell  oh
iWaXjgDEfj0,81360,87759,number four  earrings  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,87759,95320,oh so loud  number five  fight
iWaXjgDEfj0,97230,101469,[Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,102479,109280,and with all five of these help us  experience what is going on around us in
iWaXjgDEfj0,109280,114320,different ways  let's check out this map to see what our
iWaXjgDEfj0,114320,119759,five basic senses are for our first  basic sense touch
iWaXjgDEfj0,119759,125439,let's see what we can find at home  for instance our sense of touch
iWaXjgDEfj0,125439,132959,allowed us to feel things like the  temperature  when it's hot
iWaXjgDEfj0,133120,139760,or  cold outside  also we can feel pain
iWaXjgDEfj0,139760,144239,like when you step on a lego
iWaXjgDEfj0,145760,154610,and we can feel different textures like  slime that are gooey and stinky
iWaXjgDEfj0,154610,160800,[Music]  for our next basic sense
iWaXjgDEfj0,160800,169239,how about we go on a tasty picnic  our sense of taste allowed us to taste
iWaXjgDEfj0,169239,177120,flavors for instance chocolate  tastes sweet
iWaXjgDEfj0,179760,185319,lemons  taste sour
iWaXjgDEfj0,186159,190959,so sour  and chips
iWaXjgDEfj0,192159,195360,taste salty
iWaXjgDEfj0,197519,204080,now let's check out a movie at the  smelly cinema  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,204080,210000,our sense of smell  allows us to tell if there is good or
iWaXjgDEfj0,210000,216879,bad older  we can smell some
iWaXjgDEfj0,216879,224400,mmm  delicious popcorn  and you can also smell someone's stinky
iWaXjgDEfj0,224400,230720,shoe  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,230720,237360,i think we have smelled enough  time to head into sound city
iWaXjgDEfj0,238159,244760,our sense of hearing  allows us to hear different sounds
iWaXjgDEfj0,244760,252080,[Music]  if you hear chirping
iWaXjgDEfj0,252080,257759,a bird can be close by  you can also hear
iWaXjgDEfj0,257759,266400,someone's playing an instrument  [Applause]  [Music]  or a fire truck coming down the streets
iWaXjgDEfj0,266400,271600,with the siren on do you guys hear that  [Applause]  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,271600,280919,for our last basic sense  we need to see  time to go to sight school
iWaXjgDEfj0,283120,288320,fight allows us to recognize things  around us
iWaXjgDEfj0,288960,295280,we can see different colors  like a shirt could be yellow
iWaXjgDEfj0,295280,303199,or red  we can also see motion  like if someone tossed an apple to us we
iWaXjgDEfj0,303199,308000,can see when it's close enough to catch  it
iWaXjgDEfj0,308720,315360,i got it  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,315360,323199,so i use my sense of sight  to see the apple  i can also see that it's red
iWaXjgDEfj0,323199,331039,my sense of smell  [Music]  is telling me that this apple smells so
iWaXjgDEfj0,331039,337440,sweet  with my sense of touch  i can tell you that the texture
iWaXjgDEfj0,337440,343039,is smooth  it doesn't make any sound by itself
iWaXjgDEfj0,343039,352840,but if i were to pat it  it gives me a soft tapping sound and
iWaXjgDEfj0,354240,358560,with my sense of taste i can say
iWaXjgDEfj0,359280,365360,that it tastes sweet  now let's put all our senses to a test
iWaXjgDEfj0,365360,372319,with what's in the box challenge let's  go  i'm ready to test out my five senses
iWaXjgDEfj0,372319,377440,with  what's in the box challenge  let's get started
iWaXjgDEfj0,377440,385440,okay  oh  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,389600,396080,i think my sense of touch is telling me  that it's a popsicle am i right

iWaXjgDEfj0,404400,411360,oh it's a straw  so i guess this is testing my sense of  taste okay
iWaXjgDEfj0,411360,417759,let's try this  [Music]  oh
iWaXjgDEfj0,417759,423759,my sense of taste is telling me that it  must be  diet coke
iWaXjgDEfj0,423759,431759,am i right let's see  i am right yeah another point for me
iWaXjgDEfj0,431759,439440,so i'm thinking this one is testing my  sense of smell  something very strong i can smell it
iWaXjgDEfj0,439440,445680,let's see  um  definitely not broccoli
iWaXjgDEfj0,445680,452080,i think it is  [Music]  onion am i right

iWaXjgDEfj0,524880,531120,wow we did it you guys we use our five  senses to complete the what's in the box
iWaXjgDEfj0,531120,538399,challenge  now that we know all about our five  senses  let's do a pop quiz
iWaXjgDEfj0,538399,543680,question number one  why do we have basic senses is it
iWaXjgDEfj0,543680,549200,because of a  to experience the world's around us
iWaXjgDEfj0,549200,556160,or is it because of b  to ride a bike  or is because of c

iWaXjgDEfj0,754320,759760,i know it's in the wrong order  did you know that the colors of the
iWaXjgDEfj0,759760,765210,rainbow are always in the same order  what is it again what is that order
iWaXjgDEfj0,765210,770399,[Music]  it is roy  g

iWaXjgDEfj0,805839,811839,you got it that's it that's the order  roy g biv
iWaXjgDEfj0,811839,818560,there we go another rainbow looks so  happy  so now we know the order and the color
iWaXjgDEfj0,818560,824240,of the rainbow  but why  did the rainbow appear after the big
iWaXjgDEfj0,824240,830399,storm  oh no i think a storm is coming i better  use my umbrella
iWaXjgDEfj0,831360,835360,i better run inside the house i'll be  right back
iWaXjgDEfj0,836639,842240,is the storm over  oh yeah it is yay now let's see if we
iWaXjgDEfj0,842240,849519,can find that rainbow  where is the rainbow  there it is rainbow yeah look at this oh
iWaXjgDEfj0,849519,857320,wait a minute this is not a real rainbow  this is just a pool float let's test it  out
iWaXjgDEfj0,859440,865920,now this will be so much fun in the pool  so when a storm comes and it rains
iWaXjgDEfj0,865920,874399,really hard it leaves water droplets in  the sky  these droplets refract which means bent
iWaXjgDEfj0,874399,880480,light so when the sun shines white light  on the water droplet the light bends
iWaXjgDEfj0,880480,886880,and we see all seven colors because they  bend at different angles  red is first
iWaXjgDEfj0,886880,894079,orange is second yellow is third green  is fourth blue is fifth
iWaXjgDEfj0,894079,899360,indigo is six and violet is seven rory g
iWaXjgDEfj0,899360,905600,fifth  so seven colors total  the first person who discovered how a
iWaXjgDEfj0,905600,912000,rainbow works  was sir isaac newton  he shines a white light on a prism like
iWaXjgDEfj0,912000,918000,this i'm gonna use a flashlight let's  test it out  do you guys see the rainbow right there
iWaXjgDEfj0,918000,923199,isn't it neat  [Music]  i also heard there is a pot of gold at
iWaXjgDEfj0,923199,928560,the end of the rainbow so let's go catch  that rainbow let's go
iWaXjgDEfj0,928560,936160,look there's a rainbow over there let's  see we can find the treasure at the end  of the rainbow hurry let's go
iWaXjgDEfj0,937519,942720,oh  no we can do this we can do this come on
iWaXjgDEfj0,942720,947199,oh are we getting any closer you guys  are we
iWaXjgDEfj0,948160,954560,the rainbow is so far away i don't think  i can ever reach the rainbow what should  i do
iWaXjgDEfj0,954560,962000,who are you hello i'm a leprechaun are  you trying to get a hold of me pot of  gold i was trying i was trying to get to
iWaXjgDEfj0,962000,968560,the rainbow but no matter how fast i run  i don't think i can ever get to the  rainbow that's because the rainbow never
iWaXjgDEfj0,968560,975199,really ends as long as the water  droplets are in the sky the sunlight  will make the colors appear at the same
iWaXjgDEfj0,975199,982560,distance away from you so if i keep  running i'll never get to the rainbow  no theory oh man but then how do you
iWaXjgDEfj0,982560,988560,know where your pot of gold is that's me  little secret but i can share some with  you if you want
iWaXjgDEfj0,988560,996079,yes please  wow  look at all the gold

iWaXjgDEfj0,1018079,1023839,what'd you guys think  now that we know so much about rainbow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1023839,1030558,let's take a quiz  question number one what are the colors  of the rainbow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1030558,1040959,red orange yellow green blue indigo  violet  or is it pink green gray turquoise black
iWaXjgDEfj0,1040959,1046799,blue and tan  or is it white
iWaXjgDEfj0,1047600,1053760,question number two  why do rainbow appear after the storm
iWaXjgDEfj0,1053760,1059360,so leprechaun can hide their gold  sunlight shines on water droplets and
iWaXjgDEfj0,1059360,1065679,they refract lights or is it hot outside  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,1065679,1071679,question number three  how many colors are there in a rainbow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1071679,1076240,fifty  one or seven
iWaXjgDEfj0,1076720,1083280,great job i have so much fun learning  about rainbows with you  now let's share this pot of treasure
iWaXjgDEfj0,1083280,1089520,with ryan let's go  and that's how rainbow is formed
iWaXjgDEfj0,1089520,1095520,and look what i brought for you what is  that  a 1 million dollar you weren't i don't
iWaXjgDEfj0,1095520,1102080,even know that was in there no  oh they're just chocolate chocolate  million dollars
iWaXjgDEfj0,1102080,1109039,oh wow it's huge  yeah and  chocolate coins
iWaXjgDEfj0,1109039,1117399,thank you for watching our rainbow video  bye  while i enjoy my chocolate
iWaXjgDEfj0,1125360,1133840,ryan what are you doing oh i'm playing  with ooh black  mommy is oobleck a solid or a liquid why
iWaXjgDEfj0,1133840,1140559,do you ask because it drips like a  liquid  but when i punch it
iWaXjgDEfj0,1140559,1146480,it acts like a solid  ryan  ooh black is actually a liquid and a
iWaXjgDEfj0,1146480,1152559,solid at the same time  let me show you guys why
iWaXjgDEfj0,1152559,1159840,mommy did you know that matter is  anything with the map and occupied space
iWaXjgDEfj0,1159840,1166559,so i'm a matter  you're a matter too  and there are three types of matter
iWaXjgDEfj0,1166559,1171840,solid like this ice cold cold
iWaXjgDEfj0,1171840,1176760,liquid like this watercolor
iWaXjgDEfj0,1178640,1184880,or gas  [Music]  oh hold on
iWaXjgDEfj0,1185760,1193240,there we go now the balloon is full of  air which is gas inside look
iWaXjgDEfj0,1195840,1203520,but why are there three states of matter  well it's because the particles in solid
iWaXjgDEfj0,1203520,1209760,liquid and gas are all different for  example solid like this ball has
iWaXjgDEfj0,1209760,1214720,particles that keep its shape in volume
iWaXjgDEfj0,1215760,1220990,this is also a solid  right keep the shape and volume
iWaXjgDEfj0,1220990,1226720,[Music]  this is also a solid
iWaXjgDEfj0,1226720,1232640,keeping same shape and volume  wow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1232880,1238159,i'm okay liquids however have particles  that are free to move around
iWaXjgDEfj0,1238159,1245039,it keeps the same volume but different  shape  for example this liquid here look what
iWaXjgDEfj0,1245039,1250320,happened  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,1250320,1257120,see it keeps the shape of the container  but it's the same amount of volume
iWaXjgDEfj0,1257120,1263280,now let's put the liquid into a  different shape container this is a  shape of a bowl
iWaXjgDEfj0,1263280,1268480,and now  [Music]  this is the shape
iWaXjgDEfj0,1268480,1273520,of this cylinder  gas have particles that are so loose
iWaXjgDEfj0,1273520,1280240,they have no definite shape or volume so  this i have dry ice and i'm gonna mix it
iWaXjgDEfj0,1280240,1288640,in with water  and look it produces carbon dioxide gas
iWaXjgDEfj0,1288640,1296130,it just goes everywhere filling up the  whole room  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,1296720,1303679,look at the gas blow  but what happens with things like slime
iWaXjgDEfj0,1303679,1310159,this a solid or is it a liquid  before we explain what is slime let's
iWaXjgDEfj0,1310159,1316480,make our own special kind called oobleck  all you need is cornstarch  scoop coloring
iWaXjgDEfj0,1316480,1321760,and water pour it inside a bowl  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,1321760,1328400,let's make our watercolor grease  that's pretty
iWaXjgDEfj0,1328400,1333679,get a spoon  agitate it then pour it into our
iWaXjgDEfj0,1333679,1340000,cornstarch  mix it up
iWaXjgDEfj0,1340240,1345760,now this is really cool  because look  you pick it up
iWaXjgDEfj0,1345760,1351840,it looks like a liquid see  liquid  but what happened if you tap it like
iWaXjgDEfj0,1351840,1359520,this  whoa  it was hard like cement and again one
iWaXjgDEfj0,1359520,1365840,two three  what if i do it slowly
iWaXjgDEfj0,1365840,1374799,it's a liquid what's going on so it's  slime like ooh black  is this a solid or a liquid well this is
iWaXjgDEfj0,1374799,1382080,a special kind it's called non-newtonian  liquid but what is a non-newtonian
iWaXjgDEfj0,1382080,1389760,liquid well it can behave  as a solid when pressure is applied like  this
iWaXjgDEfj0,1389760,1395280,or it could behave like a liquid  when pressure is not applied
iWaXjgDEfj0,1395280,1402960,pretty cool stuff huh  i have an idea why don't we mix it up  and add glitter and other things to our
iWaXjgDEfj0,1402960,1408480,old black  [Music]  some pom-poms
iWaXjgDEfj0,1408480,1418159,and some glitter  there let's mix it up  look how cool this looks wow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1418159,1423760,there it is your own non-newtonian  liquid is it a solid
iWaXjgDEfj0,1423760,1429039,or is it a liquid  [Music]  when you're done playing with your old
iWaXjgDEfj0,1429039,1435730,black do not pour down the sink or else  it might clog the sink you can either  pour it in the trash
iWaXjgDEfj0,1435730,1441279,[Music]  or you can save it in a ziploc bag so
iWaXjgDEfj0,1441279,1447039,you can play with it for later so to  recap the three states of matter are  solid
iWaXjgDEfj0,1447039,1454010,which has a definite volume and a  definite shape like this ball is a  circle
iWaXjgDEfj0,1454010,1462000,[Music]  oh sorry gus  second is a liquid like this water here
iWaXjgDEfj0,1462000,1467519,a definite volume but not a definite  shape
iWaXjgDEfj0,1468159,1473840,and the third type of matter is a gas
iWaXjgDEfj0,1479919,1487679,the gas in this balloon does not have a  definite volume and does not have a  definite shape the gas that was in my
iWaXjgDEfj0,1487679,1494080,mouth now is inside this balloon let the  gas in the balloon go
iWaXjgDEfj0,1494640,1501360,and now the gas will spread and takes  the shape of the room  so now that we learned all about solid
iWaXjgDEfj0,1501360,1506720,liquid and gas how about we take a test  question number one
iWaXjgDEfj0,1506720,1512799,how many states of matter are there  is it a one states a matter
iWaXjgDEfj0,1512799,1519039,or is it b  a million states a matter or this c
iWaXjgDEfj0,1519039,1524080,three states of matter  that's right the answer is c
iWaXjgDEfj0,1524080,1529679,there are three states of matter  question number two
iWaXjgDEfj0,1529679,1537520,what are the three states of matter is  it a  lions bears and tigers
iWaXjgDEfj0,1537520,1543279,or is it b  sun moon and stars or
iWaXjgDEfj0,1543279,1549440,is it c  solid  liquid and gas
iWaXjgDEfj0,1549440,1554840,well that's right it is c  the three states of matter are
iWaXjgDEfj0,1554840,1561760,solid liquid  and gas  question number three
iWaXjgDEfj0,1561760,1569039,what can a non-newtonian liquid do  is it a  it can change color
iWaXjgDEfj0,1569039,1574320,or is it b  it can change its viscosity if a strong
iWaXjgDEfj0,1574320,1581440,force is applied  or is it c  it can sing
iWaXjgDEfj0,1582559,1589279,did you guys guess the answer  that's right  a non-newtonian liquid is b
iWaXjgDEfj0,1589279,1594960,it can change its viscosity if a force  is applied so sometimes it could be a
iWaXjgDEfj0,1594960,1602080,liquid  or sometimes it could be a solid  so now that we learned so much about
iWaXjgDEfj0,1602080,1608000,solid liquid and gas  let's go back and tell ryan let's go
iWaXjgDEfj0,1608240,1613840,so there it is that's why ooh black is  good liquid and a solid at the same time
iWaXjgDEfj0,1613840,1620799,wow that's so cool i didn't know it  could be a liquid and a solid  non-utodium
iWaXjgDEfj0,1620799,1628880,whoa  bye thank you for watching remember or  stay happy and rise up bye-bye
iWaXjgDEfj0,1629580,1636080,[Music]  hey guys do you think this rubber ducky  is gonna sink or float i think it's
iWaXjgDEfj0,1636080,1642950,gonna float  whoa it's floating
iWaXjgDEfj0,1642950,1648320,[Music]  good job ryan now what about this mallet
iWaXjgDEfj0,1648320,1654399,whoa do you think it's going to sink or  float  i think it's going to
iWaXjgDEfj0,1654399,1657760,sink let's see
iWaXjgDEfj0,1659919,1666000,it's safe good job  but mommy why do you think sink would
iWaXjgDEfj0,1666000,1671279,float  good question ryan  i'll show you come on guys
iWaXjgDEfj0,1671279,1677840,where'd mommy go  did you know an object's ability to sink  or float is called
iWaXjgDEfj0,1677840,1685200,buoyancy  but why does an object sink or float  object will sink if they're more dense
iWaXjgDEfj0,1685200,1691279,than water  an object will float if they're less  dense than water
iWaXjgDEfj0,1691279,1697840,so let's try putting these objects in  water to see which one will sink
iWaXjgDEfj0,1697840,1703600,and which one  will float  let's see what we have here
iWaXjgDEfj0,1703600,1708640,squishy  some diamond jewels
iWaXjgDEfj0,1708640,1715600,and a basketball  get that back come back
iWaXjgDEfj0,1715600,1721200,this squishy toys feels light but let's  see if it will float in water all right
iWaXjgDEfj0,1721200,1726960,one two three  wow
iWaXjgDEfj0,1726960,1732799,the squishy toy float in water so what  does that mean it's less dense than
iWaXjgDEfj0,1732799,1738399,water yay  okay let's see what we have next
iWaXjgDEfj0,1738399,1744480,next we have these stones so colorful  woo hoo oh so bright
iWaXjgDEfj0,1744480,1750840,they're smaller than the squishy toys do  you guys think it'll float in water but  they're heavier does that make a
iWaXjgDEfj0,1750840,1757200,difference ah let's see one two three  oh no
iWaXjgDEfj0,1757200,1760248,[Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,1762880,1768799,wow so what does this mean these stones  are more dense than water
iWaXjgDEfj0,1768799,1775039,look they sink all the way to the bottom  next we have a basketball look it
iWaXjgDEfj0,1775039,1780799,bounces  it's  it's heavier than the squishy toy
iWaXjgDEfj0,1780799,1786080,and it's bigger than the squishy toy do  you guys think this will float or sink
iWaXjgDEfj0,1786080,1793240,in water all right let's test it out  one two three
iWaXjgDEfj0,1794559,1799600,what did you guys notice it floats in  water what does that mean
iWaXjgDEfj0,1799600,1806080,it's less stink than water  even though it's bigger and heavier than
iWaXjgDEfj0,1806080,1812080,the squishy toy they both float  so why does the basketball float
iWaXjgDEfj0,1812080,1817279,well it's hollow and empty inside it is  full of air
iWaXjgDEfj0,1817279,1824158,and air is less dense than water so it  helps the basketball float
iWaXjgDEfj0,1825039,1830080,i have an idea let's go grab a whole  bunch of other stuff to try be right  back
iWaXjgDEfj0,1830080,1835840,okay  okay guys we've got a whole bunch of  stuff for us to try okay so remember an
iWaXjgDEfj0,1835840,1841600,object will sink if the density is  greater than water and an object will
iWaXjgDEfj0,1841600,1848960,float if the density is less than water  so let's see  mr sharp you want to give it a try it's
iWaXjgDEfj0,1848960,1855120,not a real shark it's a toy shark  sink or float let's see are you greater
iWaXjgDEfj0,1855120,1860960,than water for density or less  one two three
iWaXjgDEfj0,1861120,1866799,the shark floats  wow  must have a lot of air inside do you
iWaXjgDEfj0,1866799,1873840,guys remember these  fidget spinners  sink or float let's test it out one
iWaXjgDEfj0,1873840,1881200,two three  they sink
iWaXjgDEfj0,1882000,1888559,so what does that mean  the density of fidget spinner is greater  than water
iWaXjgDEfj0,1888559,1895440,next  scissors so this is a plastic scissor  but we're gonna see if it sinks or float
iWaXjgDEfj0,1895440,1901679,in water you ready  one  two  three
iWaXjgDEfj0,1902559,1911760,it floats did you guys guess that right  so these are less dense than water okay
iWaXjgDEfj0,1911760,1918640,poopy cushion  okay  all right sink or float what do you guys  think one two
iWaXjgDEfj0,1918640,1925200,three  also floats
iWaXjgDEfj0,1925200,1930399,who likes to fly american football  hot
iWaXjgDEfj0,1931039,1939120,sink or float one two three  sorry i'll be right back
iWaXjgDEfj0,1939120,1945200,obviously no not good at american  football one two three fight hot catch
iWaXjgDEfj0,1945200,1951039,yay  flows wow  somewhere we're doing great
iWaXjgDEfj0,1951039,1958640,but he's a tricky one  paper clip  sink or float
iWaXjgDEfj0,1958640,1964398,one two  three move away because
iWaXjgDEfj0,1966320,1974159,so what's happening  they all stink that means the paper
iWaXjgDEfj0,1974159,1981600,clips density is greater than water  okay what's next this is so fun
iWaXjgDEfj0,1981600,1986880,what about the giant glasses  these sink or float
iWaXjgDEfj0,1986880,1993519,any guesses  all right let's buy glasses one two  three
iWaXjgDEfj0,1993519,1998799,oh is it gonna sink or is it gonna float  oh it's hovering it's hovering ah what
iWaXjgDEfj0,1998799,2004720,do you guys think i think it's pretty  close to water's density that's why it's  right there
iWaXjgDEfj0,2004720,2012240,in between sinking and floating so since  you guys didn't ask what is the density  of water it is the density of water is
iWaXjgDEfj0,2012240,2017440,one gram per milliliter so anytime an  object's density is greater than one
iWaXjgDEfj0,2017440,2024720,gram per milliliter  it thinks anytime an object density is  less than one grams per milliliter it
iWaXjgDEfj0,2024720,2033840,floats  um  trumpet  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2033840,2039200,sink or float don't forget there's lots  of air inside here lots of holes
iWaXjgDEfj0,2039200,2047039,and it's pretty plasticky one two three  bloat
iWaXjgDEfj0,2047039,2053839,all right  lobster you guys like lobster  hey mr lobster do you sink or float in
iWaXjgDEfj0,2053839,2060560,water well i am a lobster so i think i'm  going to sink oh okay let's see if it's
iWaXjgDEfj0,2060560,2066560,true he thinks he's gonna sink what do  you guys think  one  two
iWaXjgDEfj0,2066560,2075040,three  oh  mr lobster distance
iWaXjgDEfj0,2075040,2081040,bye bye lobster  good thing he likes water huh so what  does that mean
iWaXjgDEfj0,2081040,2090079,density is greater than water  okay we're gonna clear off the tank  because i have a super fun experiment
iWaXjgDEfj0,2090079,2097118,diet coke  versus regular coke which one will sink  and which one will stay afloat all right
iWaXjgDEfj0,2097118,2104829,let's put it into the water  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2105839,2111200,okay guys we have to wait okay  something's cool is gonna happen
iWaXjgDEfj0,2111200,2118320,wow look what you guys noticed  that diet coke float and that's regular
iWaXjgDEfj0,2118320,2124720,coke's sleep  so what does this mean  the diet coke
iWaXjgDEfj0,2124720,2129920,is less dense than water  but the regular coke where are you
iWaXjgDEfj0,2129920,2135359,regular cook there you are  it's more dense than water do you know
iWaXjgDEfj0,2135359,2142640,why  because this actually has lots and lots  and lots of sugar inside so the sugar is
iWaXjgDEfj0,2142640,2149359,more dense than water so it  sink the coke
iWaXjgDEfj0,2149359,2156800,and the diet coke actually has less than  one gram of sugar so  mostly just water and air inside so it
iWaXjgDEfj0,2156800,2165440,floats  wow  excuse me miss ryan's mom yes i'm doing
iWaXjgDEfj0,2165440,2171040,some homework on buoyancy and i'm trying  to understand how these giant cruise  ships are able to float in the ocean
iWaXjgDEfj0,2171040,2177359,that's a good question peck those cruise  ships can float in water because it's
iWaXjgDEfj0,2177359,2184079,hollow like this basketball full of air  it's hollowing full of air
iWaXjgDEfj0,2184079,2190320,got it but that's not all peck  it's because also the shape of the  cruise ship
iWaXjgDEfj0,2190320,2197119,i have an idea let's do one more  experiment oh joy another experiment i
iWaXjgDEfj0,2197119,2204560,love experiments  let's go  did you know that ship is shaped so that
iWaXjgDEfj0,2204560,2211440,most of it is above water that way it  doesn't displace too much water
iWaXjgDEfj0,2211440,2218240,this place yeah let's try this i'm going  to put ice
iWaXjgDEfj0,2218240,2225760,cold  in this cup then it's full of water and  see what happens guys ready oh it's so
iWaXjgDEfj0,2225760,2229400,cold okay
iWaXjgDEfj0,2231520,2237359,whoa  the water spilled everywhere  yeah so when we put the ice in a cup of
iWaXjgDEfj0,2237359,2243839,water that's already filled the water  spills out right  so when an object pushes water out of
iWaXjgDEfj0,2243839,2250480,the way  this is called displacement  yes so this is why ships
iWaXjgDEfj0,2250480,2255839,don't sink they are hollow like the  basketball and full of air and they're
iWaXjgDEfj0,2255839,2263040,shaped so that they don't displace too  much water  that's right  oh joy i can finish my homework now
iWaXjgDEfj0,2263040,2268480,thank you miss ryan's mom see you later  you're welcome pack bye
iWaXjgDEfj0,2268480,2274320,so i think that now we're an expert on  objects sinking or floating in water
iWaXjgDEfj0,2274320,2280079,let's try a pop quiz let's go  question number one
iWaXjgDEfj0,2280079,2287920,what  is it a an object's ability to sink
iWaXjgDEfj0,2287920,2296160,or float  or is it b  buoyancy is a boy ant
iWaXjgDEfj0,2296160,2302960,or is it c is buoyancy a cheeseburger
iWaXjgDEfj0,2303120,2310160,[Music]  can you guess this  the answer is a
iWaXjgDEfj0,2310160,2316400,buoyancy is an object's ability to sink
iWaXjgDEfj0,2316400,2321440,or float yay  all right now let's move on to question
iWaXjgDEfj0,2321440,2328480,number two  why does object sink is it because a
iWaXjgDEfj0,2328480,2334640,they're blue  all object that's blue float  or is it b
iWaXjgDEfj0,2334640,2340480,they like to swim  or is it c
iWaXjgDEfj0,2340480,2347200,they are more dense than water  so what's the answer why do objects  stick it's because c
iWaXjgDEfj0,2347200,2355040,they are more dense than water  question number three why do ships float
iWaXjgDEfj0,2355040,2360480,is it because a  they're hollow  full of air
iWaXjgDEfj0,2360480,2366320,it's a shape does this place too much  water  or it's because b
iWaXjgDEfj0,2366320,2372320,they're made of squishy  or it's because of c
iWaXjgDEfj0,2372320,2379040,they're hungry  do you know the answer why do ships  float it's because of a
iWaXjgDEfj0,2379040,2384160,ship float because they're hollow full  of air
iWaXjgDEfj0,2384160,2391440,and their shape doesn't displace too  much water  so how did you guys do on the quiz
iWaXjgDEfj0,2391440,2396838,if you're gonna get subscribed you can  try again next time
iWaXjgDEfj0,2409440,2415520,so ryan  that's why some things sink and  something's float
iWaXjgDEfj0,2415520,2422000,thank you for showing me all about my  sinks and floats mommy of course now
iWaXjgDEfj0,2422000,2428319,final question for you ryan  will this ball sink or fall it will
iWaXjgDEfj0,2428319,2433920,float okay let's see brian's right  yay
iWaXjgDEfj0,2433920,2440800,good job now does that mean this ball is  less dense than water or more dense than
iWaXjgDEfj0,2440800,2447520,water less dense yay  thank you for watching our sink and
iWaXjgDEfj0,2447520,2452560,float video bye  remember always stay happy and rise up
iWaXjgDEfj0,2452560,2459280,bye  hey guys let's go outside and play
iWaXjgDEfj0,2459280,2464319,yeah  wait  no forgot sunscreen
iWaXjgDEfj0,2464319,2472480,wait  oh no we didn't  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2472480,2478000,sunscreen helps protect our skin from  the sun just like earth's ozone layer
iWaXjgDEfj0,2478000,2483520,did you know earth has a layer called  ozone and it helps protect the earth  from the sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,2483520,2489040,let's learn more about it  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2489280,2494960,i'll take it from here ryan  hi everybody do you see that pale blue
iWaXjgDEfj0,2494960,2502480,layer around earth  that's a layer of ozone gas  it's this layer in the earth's
iWaXjgDEfj0,2502480,2508640,atmosphere that protects all living  things from the sun's ultraviolet  radiation
iWaXjgDEfj0,2508640,2515200,also known as uv rays  these rays can be dangerous to our skin
iWaXjgDEfj0,2515200,2521520,damaging to the plants and increase the  temperatures on earth  we have to take care of the ozone layer
iWaXjgDEfj0,2521520,2527839,so they can keep protecting us  oh gosh look i see a spot where uv rays
iWaXjgDEfj0,2527839,2534720,are reaching earth come on  wow  look how big it is
iWaXjgDEfj0,2534720,2539839,this year the hole in the ozone is 24  million square kilometers which is
iWaXjgDEfj0,2539839,2545440,approximately 9.3 million square miles  that's the size of three united states
iWaXjgDEfj0,2545440,2551040,put together wow  this hole wasn't always here
iWaXjgDEfj0,2551040,2557440,it was first discovered in 1985.  the world advanced with technology and
iWaXjgDEfj0,2557440,2563359,industry started to release gases  harmful to the atmosphere  most of these gases are called
iWaXjgDEfj0,2563359,2569040,chlorofluorocarbons  also known as cfcs
iWaXjgDEfj0,2569040,2576800,these are found in refrigerants and  aerosols breaking  so over time the buildup of harmful
iWaXjgDEfj0,2576800,2584269,gases caused his home  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2585520,2591920,wait a second we're floating right above  my hometown  this ozone hole is located right above
iWaXjgDEfj0,2591920,2598939,antarctica  let's go  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2599839,2606880,on september 16 1985 nations around the  world agreed to protect the ozone layer
iWaXjgDEfj0,2606880,2613440,september 16th is officially known as  ozone day  now that we all know about the ozone
iWaXjgDEfj0,2613440,2619839,hole we must do our part to fix it let's  learn five things you can do every day
iWaXjgDEfj0,2619839,2627599,to help heal the ozone  number one  avoid any products that release cfcs or
iWaXjgDEfj0,2627599,2634720,other harmful gases  number two  reduce the use of vehicles instead of
iWaXjgDEfj0,2634720,2640400,driving a car you can ride a bike or  walk because these don't pollute the air
iWaXjgDEfj0,2640400,2646720,the same way cars do  number three  don't use cleaning products that release
iWaXjgDEfj0,2646720,2652480,harmful gases  number four  get groceries locally
iWaXjgDEfj0,2652480,2658400,it reduces waste from packaging  it also reduces gases being released
iWaXjgDEfj0,2658400,2664079,into the atmosphere from shipping and  transporting  number five
iWaXjgDEfj0,2664079,2671520,recycle  when we recycle we're reusing items  we've used already
iWaXjgDEfj0,2671520,2676560,this means that they don't have to be  manufactured again or burned
iWaXjgDEfj0,2676560,2681760,both of which released harmful gases  into the atmosphere  and remember
iWaXjgDEfj0,2681760,2687520,like ryan you should always wear  sunscreen to protect your skin from the  sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,2687520,2694720,that's right peck remember to do your  part to help heal the ozone layer that's  all for today bye remember oh say happy
iWaXjgDEfj0,2694720,2704040,and rides up bye i'm gonna go play now  whoa guys check out the clouds today
iWaXjgDEfj0,2704240,2711520,i wonder where clouds come from  that one's shaped like a panda like
iWaXjgDEfj0,2711520,2718319,combo  combo bunker  [Music]  and that one looks like heck
iWaXjgDEfj0,2718319,2722880,wait a minute  it is peck
iWaXjgDEfj0,2723440,2731200,hey ryan  oh hey pat what are you up to today i've  been learning all about the water cycle
iWaXjgDEfj0,2731200,2737359,i heard you wanted to know where clouds  come from right  wait are you saying clouds are part of
iWaXjgDEfj0,2737359,2743839,the water cycle that's right  can you teach me all about it of course
iWaXjgDEfj0,2743839,2749920,leave it to me  bye jack  wait  where did that go  heck
iWaXjgDEfj0,2749920,2755200,hey everybody i've been flying through  the clouds studying the waterslide
iWaXjgDEfj0,2755200,2761119,let me show you what i've discovered  condensation  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2761119,2768079,clouds like this are made up of tiny  water droplets  all around us there's water in the air
iWaXjgDEfj0,2768079,2774960,called water vapor  it's too small for us to see because  it's in the gas form of water
iWaXjgDEfj0,2774960,2780319,when water vapor gets high in the sky  like when we are the water vapor cools
iWaXjgDEfj0,2780319,2786240,and condenses back into liquid water  this look at water sticks to things in
iWaXjgDEfj0,2786240,2793359,the air are dust and this is how clouds  form  this phase of the water cycle is called
iWaXjgDEfj0,2793359,2798480,condensation  look more water is condensing and making
iWaXjgDEfj0,2798480,2804640,the cloud grow  it's getting heavy which means it's  almost time for the next step of the
iWaXjgDEfj0,2804640,2810240,water cycle  precipitation  we're on the ground now and we're
iWaXjgDEfj0,2810240,2816760,waiting for the next phase of the water  cycle which is precipitation
iWaXjgDEfj0,2817359,2823040,eureka  see  when the clouds can't hold any more  water
iWaXjgDEfj0,2823040,2829200,gravity makes the water fall back to  earth  this is called precipitation and it can
iWaXjgDEfj0,2829200,2835280,be in the form of rain  sleet  snow  or even hail
iWaXjgDEfj0,2835280,2841040,let's follow the path of where this  water is going  it will surely lead us to the next phase
iWaXjgDEfj0,2841040,2847440,of the water cycle let's go collection  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2847440,2852720,the rain stopped let's examine where it  ended up
iWaXjgDEfj0,2856240,2861839,we followed the flow of water through a  process called runoff and all the water
iWaXjgDEfj0,2861839,2868960,seems to collect in this area this is  the collection phase of the water site  and here comes the sun to complete the
iWaXjgDEfj0,2868960,2874480,water cycle let's go evaporation  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,2874480,2881520,i found the best way to show the final  stage of the water cycle  a puddle if we wait here long enough
iWaXjgDEfj0,2881520,2889599,while the sun is out we'll be able to  see this puddle disappear it will  evaporate which is the last stage of the
iWaXjgDEfj0,2889599,2897280,water cycle for us to cover  evaporation happens when the rays from  the sun heat the liquid water and turn
iWaXjgDEfj0,2897280,2904319,it into water vaping at this stage water  goes from liquid into a gas
iWaXjgDEfj0,2904319,2911599,oh boy  look all the water evaporated that means  it's become a gas and it's rising into
iWaXjgDEfj0,2911599,2920160,the atmosphere to become clouds again  and that's all for the water cycle
iWaXjgDEfj0,2920160,2927920,recap  let's go over what we learned about the  water cycle  there are four stages of the water cycle
iWaXjgDEfj0,2927920,2935119,condensation  precipitation  collection  and evaporation
iWaXjgDEfj0,2935119,2940400,condensation is when water vapor floats  the sky to create clouds
iWaXjgDEfj0,2940400,2948079,precipitation is when water falls to the  ground as in rain sleet snow or hail
iWaXjgDEfj0,2948079,2955119,collection is where water collects after  it falls into the ground  it can be in rivers lakes and even
iWaXjgDEfj0,2955119,2961599,cuddles  evaporation is where the sun rays heat  up water to become vapor and that vapor
iWaXjgDEfj0,2961599,2967040,rises to the sky to become clouds  [Music]  wow
iWaXjgDEfj0,2967040,2974960,thanks to peck's water cycle research i  think all these clouds mean  it's about to rain
iWaXjgDEfj0,2974960,2982400,i was right  i better get inside now bye guys  remember always be happy to bring this  up bye
iWaXjgDEfj0,2982400,2987839,the sun is a yellow dwarf star that is  in the center of our solar system the
iWaXjgDEfj0,2987839,2993720,sun is a super duper hot giant ball of  gas
iWaXjgDEfj0,2996500,3003030,[Music]  hey guys astronaut ryan here let me  teach you all about the planets
iWaXjgDEfj0,3003030,3010960,[Music]  first let's start off with the sun  it's actually not a planet it's a star
iWaXjgDEfj0,3010960,3017520,so all those stars you see are exactly  like this  the sun is a yellow dwarf star that is
iWaXjgDEfj0,3017520,3022960,in the center of our solar system the  sun is a super duper hot giant ball of
iWaXjgDEfj0,3022960,3030559,gas  all the planets orbit or go around the
iWaXjgDEfj0,3030559,3033520,sun like this
iWaXjgDEfj0,3036559,3044720,do you know how many planets there are  there are eight planets in our solar  system let's learn the names in order
iWaXjgDEfj0,3044720,3050079,mercury  venus  earth  mars
iWaXjgDEfj0,3050079,3055520,jupiter  saturn  and neptune
iWaXjgDEfj0,3055520,3062400,okay so what is the order of the planets  again it's mercury venus earth mars
iWaXjgDEfj0,3062400,3068340,jupiter saturn uranus and neptune here's  a trick to remember the order
iWaXjgDEfj0,3068340,3074880,[Applause]  how do you remember the planets again  my very excellent mother just served us
iWaXjgDEfj0,3074880,3081280,noodles you ready to eat ryan  yeah after i learn about the planets  okay well
iWaXjgDEfj0,3081280,3088400,i'm not gonna wait for you  [Music]  so here's what each letter stands for
iWaXjgDEfj0,3088400,3094640,my for mercury  very for venus excellent for earth
iWaXjgDEfj0,3094640,3101280,mother for mars  just for jupiter  served for saturn
iWaXjgDEfj0,3101280,3106720,us for uranus  and noodles for neptune here's also a
iWaXjgDEfj0,3106720,3111800,very fun song to help learn the planets
iWaXjgDEfj0,3112470,3118000,[Music]  this is the planet song
iWaXjgDEfj0,3118000,3124640,if you know the order sing along planets  revolve around the sun mercury is number
iWaXjgDEfj0,3124640,3130640,one venus is number two  it's too hot for me and you earth is the
iWaXjgDEfj0,3130640,3137040,place to be  it's planet number three now let's learn  some more
iWaXjgDEfj0,3137040,3144400,mars it's red and it's number four  jupiter's number five  and it's known for its giant size saturn
iWaXjgDEfj0,3144400,3151040,is the one with rings  it's number six in the order thing seven  is the planet with ice
iWaXjgDEfj0,3151040,3158400,it's uranus and it's been on its side  number eight called neptune  it's the last one and it's blue this is
iWaXjgDEfj0,3158400,3166079,the planet song  now you know the order sing along  mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn
iWaXjgDEfj0,3166079,3172420,uranus and neptune mercury venus earth  mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
iWaXjgDEfj0,3172420,3178720,[Music]  ready to learn some fun facts about each
iWaXjgDEfj0,3178720,3184559,planet with me let's do it  the first planet that is also the
iWaXjgDEfj0,3184559,3190559,closest to the sun is mercury and it's  also the smallest planet i'll have pep
iWaXjgDEfj0,3190559,3196880,tell you more about mercury  thanks ryan  i'm so excited to share some facts about
iWaXjgDEfj0,3196880,3203040,the planets  let's start with mercury mercury is the  smallest planet
iWaXjgDEfj0,3203040,3210559,it does not have any moons or rings even  though mercury is the closest planet to  the sun it's only the second hottest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3210559,3216640,planet an entire year in mercury takes  only 88 earth things the second planet
iWaXjgDEfj0,3216640,3224040,is venus  peck tell us more about venus do you  know one day on venus last
iWaXjgDEfj0,3224040,3230480,243 earth days venus is the second  brightest object in the night sky only
iWaXjgDEfj0,3230480,3237839,the moon is brighter because of its  harsh atmosphere venus is the hottest  planet in the solar system the third
iWaXjgDEfj0,3237839,3243440,planet from the sun is earth it's also  my favorite because we live here okay
iWaXjgDEfj0,3243440,3250480,peck it's your turn to tell us some fun  facts about earth  earth is the only known planet to
iWaXjgDEfj0,3250480,3256400,support life  seventy-one percent of the earth's  surface is covered in one
iWaXjgDEfj0,3256400,3261760,although  three percent is fresh water hence two  percent is frozen in ice sheets and
iWaXjgDEfj0,3261760,3268880,icebergs  next up planet is mars it's also  sometimes called the red planet because
iWaXjgDEfj0,3268880,3275040,it looks red from earth  okay pack now tell us some fun facts
iWaXjgDEfj0,3275040,3281920,mars is known as the red planet due to  its reddish appearance  unlike other planets there are signs of
iWaXjgDEfj0,3281920,3287359,liquid water on mars which means maybe  it could one day support life
iWaXjgDEfj0,3287359,3292400,the fifth planet from the sun is jupiter  it's also the largest planet in our
iWaXjgDEfj0,3292400,3298559,solar system  okay crack can you tell us some fun  facts about jupiter
iWaXjgDEfj0,3298559,3306240,jupiter is the largest planet in the  solar system  whoa  it's primarily made up of gas and is
iWaXjgDEfj0,3306240,3311839,therefore known as the gas giant  the great red spot is a huge storm on
iWaXjgDEfj0,3311839,3316880,jupiter that is the size of three earths  this is the sixth planet from the sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,3316880,3326720,it's saturn and it sees its rings  they're actually made out of millions of  ice chunks okay fun facts with that
iWaXjgDEfj0,3327119,3332160,saturn is another gas giant it has the  most extensive rings that are made up of
iWaXjgDEfj0,3332160,3338480,ice chunks and dust saturn has 82 wounds  the seventh planet from the sun is a
iWaXjgDEfj0,3338480,3344160,race and it appears to spin on its side
iWaXjgDEfj0,3344160,3351839,and peck will tell you some more fun  facts about uranus  uranus is not visible to the naked eye
iWaXjgDEfj0,3351839,3358960,and is the first planet discovered by  the use of a telescope it is referred to  as an ice giant planet although it's not
iWaXjgDEfj0,3358960,3364240,frozen the atmosphere is filled with ice  crystals the eighth planet from the sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,3364240,3369599,is neptune and since it's so far away  from the sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,3370160,3376480,it is super dark and cold here and it  rains diamonds  cha-ching
iWaXjgDEfj0,3376480,3383200,okay and pep will tell you some more fun  facts about neptune  neptune is the most distant planet from
iWaXjgDEfj0,3383200,3389359,the sun a year of neptune lasts longer  than 165 years on earth
iWaXjgDEfj0,3389359,3396240,all the methane in neptune's atmosphere  gives it its blue color  wow learning about the planets was fun
iWaXjgDEfj0,3396240,3401839,ryan see you later  recap time how many planets are there in
iWaXjgDEfj0,3401839,3408559,the solar system  there are eight  it is  mercury venus
iWaXjgDEfj0,3408559,3415839,earth  mars  jupiter  saturn uranus and neptune
iWaXjgDEfj0,3415839,3420880,all of these planets orbit or go around  the sun like this
iWaXjgDEfj0,3420880,3427839,[Music]  that's one year  365 days some planets orbit the sun
iWaXjgDEfj0,3427839,3434400,super fast like mercury it only takes 88  days since it's the closest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3434400,3442520,already there  some planets take a very long time to  orbit the sun like a neptune it takes 16
iWaXjgDEfj0,3442520,3449110,190 days to orbit the sun  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,3449839,3456160,still going  still going
iWaXjgDEfj0,3456160,3462160,still going  still going
iWaXjgDEfj0,3462160,3467280,that was so long  so what is the order again it's mercury
iWaXjgDEfj0,3467280,3472400,venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus  and neptune
iWaXjgDEfj0,3472400,3477680,my very excellent mom just served us  noodles  okay guys thank you for learning all
iWaXjgDEfj0,3477680,3483640,about the planets with me remember  always stay happy and rise
iWaXjgDEfj0,3485870,3492319,[Music]  hey guys today i'm helping my parents
iWaXjgDEfj0,3492319,3498240,clean and putting all of this in the  trash  wait
iWaXjgDEfj0,3498240,3504640,ryan those are recyclables  really yes oh yeah
iWaXjgDEfj0,3505200,3511090,some paper goes in a paper van  and plastics
iWaXjgDEfj0,3511090,3516319,[Music]  but mommy i know it's good to recycle
iWaXjgDEfj0,3516319,3522079,but what other things can we do to save  our planet  good idea ryan
iWaXjgDEfj0,3522079,3527869,i'll show you i'll be right back you  guys  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,3528240,3536240,did you know wild rainforests are tall  dense jungles with half of the world's
iWaXjgDEfj0,3536240,3541599,plants  and animal and ice caps are huge
iWaXjgDEfj0,3541599,3550000,glaciers of ice that holds  93  of fresh water here on earth
iWaXjgDEfj0,3550000,3558799,wild rainforest and ice caps are  essential to planet earth  and they're in big big trouble
iWaXjgDEfj0,3558799,3564960,there are over 30 million species of  plants and animals in the wild
iWaXjgDEfj0,3564960,3573119,rainforest  hey we're in the rain forest and look  there are animals like fish and birds
iWaXjgDEfj0,3573119,3580480,and orangutans  that help spread pollens  all around the rainforest so that pollen
iWaXjgDEfj0,3580480,3587440,can produce all kinds of plants and  these rainforests have 70
iWaXjgDEfj0,3587440,3593760,of the plants that we use in medicine  [Music]  [Applause]
iWaXjgDEfj0,3593760,3598839,phew  that's a lot of really important reasons  why we need the
iWaXjgDEfj0,3598839,3605119,rainforest but  did you know  there are only 28
iWaXjgDEfj0,3605119,3612720,of wild forests left globally right now  so if we don't help out the rainforest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3612720,3619200,might disappear oh bye-bye rainforest  no we don't want that right
iWaXjgDEfj0,3619200,3624559,so what will happen if we let the  rainforest disappear
iWaXjgDEfj0,3624559,3630559,number one  the animals can't pollinate the plants
iWaXjgDEfj0,3630559,3635599,so that means we will have no more  plants  number two
iWaXjgDEfj0,3635599,3642559,then the plants wouldn't exist  bye bye plant  number three then we wouldn't have plans
iWaXjgDEfj0,3642559,3648720,to make our medicine  oh no  what could we do to help
iWaXjgDEfj0,3648720,3658720,i know  one thing that we can do is build a home  for animals that are migrating come on
iWaXjgDEfj0,3658720,3664160,so if you put a birdhouse like this one  here it will be a great help for birds
iWaXjgDEfj0,3664160,3669920,who are migrating  we can help them get to where they need
iWaXjgDEfj0,3669920,3675520,to go next and it will make their job  easier traveling and pollinating the
iWaXjgDEfj0,3675520,3681240,plants  oh look  hey
iWaXjgDEfj0,3688640,3695680,we also need the rainforest to help us  stop the icecap from melting
iWaXjgDEfj0,3695680,3702319,rainforests are full of trees  that clean our air by converting carbon
iWaXjgDEfj0,3702319,3709359,dioxide which is what we breathe out  into oxygen which is what we need to
iWaXjgDEfj0,3709359,3716400,breathe  and if we have too much carbon dioxide  in the air
iWaXjgDEfj0,3716400,3722799,the temperature of the planet will rise  look  oh it's getting
iWaXjgDEfj0,3722799,3730319,hot  and at the temperature of the planet  rise the ice cap will melt
iWaXjgDEfj0,3730319,3738079,into the ocean and then the ocean level  will rise oh no the water is rising
iWaXjgDEfj0,3738079,3744559,oh let's get out  so what will happen if we let the ice
iWaXjgDEfj0,3744559,3750559,cap melt  number one  water from the ice cap will drain into
iWaXjgDEfj0,3750559,3758240,the ocean  number two the ocean level will rise
iWaXjgDEfj0,3758240,3767480,and number three  land around the coast and lane at sea  level will be covered
iWaXjgDEfj0,3768000,3774240,that would be a lot of water but don't  worry  one of the things we can do
iWaXjgDEfj0,3774240,3779599,is plant our own tree ah let's go
iWaXjgDEfj0,3779599,3784960,so planting trees like this one helps  both the ice cap and the rain forest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3784960,3791280,this tree over here will help convert  carbon dioxide to oxygen just like all
iWaXjgDEfj0,3791280,3797359,the trees in the rainforest it's  something that everyone can do even you
iWaXjgDEfj0,3797359,3802400,thanks for helping me plant a tree now  it's time for a pop quiz
iWaXjgDEfj0,3802400,3808319,number one  how many species of plants and animals  are there
iWaXjgDEfj0,3808319,3814720,in the forest  is it a  30 million
iWaXjgDEfj0,3814720,3820559,is it b  five  or is it c
iWaXjgDEfj0,3820559,3828000,zero plants and animals in the rain  forest  did you guess it it is a
iWaXjgDEfj0,3828000,3834400,30 million different plants and animals  that are in the rain forest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3834400,3840640,that's a lot question number two  where do we get
iWaXjgDEfj0,3840640,3848000,70  of plants we use for medicine  is it a the rain forest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3848000,3854240,is it b  the rainbow  or  is it c
iWaXjgDEfj0,3854240,3859760,ice  did you guess it it is a the rainforest
iWaXjgDEfj0,3859760,3865760,that is where we get  70  of our plants that we use for medicine
iWaXjgDEfj0,3865760,3872079,question number three  how do trees clean the air
iWaXjgDEfj0,3872079,3878559,that's around us  is it a  with hand sewn
iWaXjgDEfj0,3878559,3885039,is it b with peanut butter  i love peanut butter they're so yummy or
iWaXjgDEfj0,3885039,3891680,is it c by converting carbon dioxide  into oxygen
iWaXjgDEfj0,3891680,3897680,did you get the right answer it is c  trees help cleans air by converting
iWaXjgDEfj0,3897680,3902720,carbon dioxide  which is what we breathe out
iWaXjgDEfj0,3902720,3908160,which is the stuff that's not really  good for our body  into oxygen which is what we need to
iWaXjgDEfj0,3908160,3914000,breathe in to our body to survive  congratulations good job and if you
iWaXjgDEfj0,3914000,3921280,didn't guess it all right you can try  again next time  so now that we learned so much about
iWaXjgDEfj0,3921280,3927119,ways to save the planet let's go back  and tell ryan  [Music]
iWaXjgDEfj0,3927119,3932960,i hope you guys learned a lot of ways to  save the planet bye remember or stay
iWaXjgDEfj0,3932960,3941119,happy and rise up bye i'm gonna go save  the planet more just one more piece
iWaXjgDEfj0,3941119,3948760,yay  oh  yeah what's going on
iWaXjgDEfj0,3956720,3964240,a little bit i know that was a strong  earthquake mommy but what causes  earthquakes good question what and what
iWaXjgDEfj0,3964240,3969440,is an earthquake right i'm gonna explain  it to you okay be right back
iWaXjgDEfj0,3969440,3976240,where'd mommy go wait  [Music]  hi there  did you know that earthquake means
iWaXjgDEfj0,3976240,3982079,there's a sudden violent shaking off of  the ground
iWaXjgDEfj0,3982079,3991559,but  what makes the ground shake is it  because i'm jumping up and down
iWaXjgDEfj0,3992720,4000079,or is it because the earth is growing  bigger  and bigger and bigger
iWaXjgDEfj0,4001599,4008880,or is it because the earth is made of  plates that slide around on
iWaXjgDEfj0,4008880,4014240,top of hot  molten magma
iWaXjgDEfj0,4014240,4019599,yeah that's right  the earth is like this orange on the
iWaXjgDEfj0,4019599,4024830,inside it's squishy and full of fluid
iWaXjgDEfj0,4024830,4032720,[Music]  on the outside the orange peel is like  the earth's crust
iWaXjgDEfj0,4033520,4039039,the earth's crust is broken up into what  we call tectonic plates
iWaXjgDEfj0,4039039,4044480,whoa look they go back together  all along the cracks of the tectonic
iWaXjgDEfj0,4044480,4050880,plates are where earthquake happens  [Music]  pretty cool huh
iWaXjgDEfj0,4050880,4057760,did you know the place where earthquakes  happen are called faults
iWaXjgDEfj0,4057760,4063599,there are three different kinds of  faults that makes earthquake happens
iWaXjgDEfj0,4063599,4071440,one  two  three  we are going to demonstrate how all
iWaXjgDEfj0,4071440,4077760,these happens  are you ready  pretend these puddings are like the
iWaXjgDEfj0,4077760,4084960,inside of the earth  the pudding is like the magma look how  jiggly they are
iWaXjgDEfj0,4084960,4092000,the rice crispy treats are like the  earth's crust  the first type of fault is a transform
iWaXjgDEfj0,4092000,4098159,fault  this means that the plates  slide and slide past each other just
iWaXjgDEfj0,4098159,4104640,like this  the second type of fault is called a  divergent fault this means that the
iWaXjgDEfj0,4104640,4109679,plates pull away from each other look
iWaXjgDEfj0,4109758,4114960,and the third type of fault is called  the convergent fault this means that the
iWaXjgDEfj0,4114960,4122960,two plates push together whoa  this is how mountain and hills happen
iWaXjgDEfj0,4122960,4130798,whoa  so those are the three kinds of faults  that cause earthquake
iWaXjgDEfj0,4130798,4138238,what is that  whoa did you guys feel that that was a
iWaXjgDEfj0,4138238,4145120,real earthquake  i wonder how big that one was  did you know that you can
iWaXjgDEfj0,4145120,4151520,measure earthquakes they get score on  how strong they are
iWaXjgDEfj0,4151520,4160000,and they go all the way to 10  on what is called the richter scale
iWaXjgDEfj0,4160000,4166400,the bigger the number the stronger the  earthquake
iWaXjgDEfj0,4166400,4172220,so  an earthquake that measures a 2.5
iWaXjgDEfj0,4172220,4178000,[Music]  it's smaller and it doesn't cause as  much damage
iWaXjgDEfj0,4178000,4184560,but  an earthquake that measures an  8.5
iWaXjgDEfj0,4186838,4194400,wow whoa do you guys see  that's a lot of damage
iWaXjgDEfj0,4194400,4202960,so now that we have all this amazing  knowledge on earthquake  it's time for a pop quiz are you ready
iWaXjgDEfj0,4202960,4208000,question number one  why do earthquake happen
iWaXjgDEfj0,4208000,4212880,a is it because the season change
iWaXjgDEfj0,4213360,4222159,b  is it because the earth is so bored  or is it because see earth is made of
iWaXjgDEfj0,4222159,4228320,plates that slide around on top of hot  molten
iWaXjgDEfj0,4228320,4237679,magma  that's right the answer is c earth is  made of plates that slide around on top
iWaXjgDEfj0,4237679,4243679,of hot  molten magma  question number two
iWaXjgDEfj0,4243679,4249600,how many kinds of faults  are there  a
iWaXjgDEfj0,4249600,4257199,is it ten  b  are there three kinds of faults
iWaXjgDEfj0,4257199,4262400,or c  a hundred type of faults
iWaXjgDEfj0,4262400,4270560,that's right the answer is b which is  three  there are three kinds of faults
iWaXjgDEfj0,4270560,4275840,final question number three  how big
iWaXjgDEfj0,4275840,4282000,does the richer scale go  a  ten
iWaXjgDEfj0,4282000,4287040,b  one  or c
iWaXjgDEfj0,4287040,4293600,one million  [Music]  that's right the answer is a which is
iWaXjgDEfj0,4293600,4300800,ten the richer scale goes from one  all the way to 10.
iWaXjgDEfj0,4300800,4306480,yay good job you guys answered all the  question correct and if you didn't it's
iWaXjgDEfj0,4306480,4313199,okay just try again good job thank you  for trying  now that we learned so much about
iWaXjgDEfj0,4313199,4319920,earthquake  a one is coming so i better go and tell  ryan okay
iWaXjgDEfj0,4320510,4327920,[Music]  okay all stable man  so ryan that's how earthquake happens
iWaXjgDEfj0,4327920,4334640,that's very cool mommy i hope an  earthquake doesn't knock down the tower  wow this is huge and giant that's so
iWaXjgDEfj0,4334640,4341960,cool ryan  oh hey guys hey whoa this is really cool
iWaXjgDEfj0,4343120,4350000,sorry  [Music]  all right guys thank you for watching  daddy quick daddy quick i know
iWaXjgDEfj0,4350000,4357560,thank you for watching our video i hope  you enjoy and learn lots about  earthquake for now bye
