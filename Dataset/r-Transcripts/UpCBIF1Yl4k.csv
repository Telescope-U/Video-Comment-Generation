UpCBIF1Yl4k,8720,11360,resentment is a key human motivation and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,11360,13519,i would say it's a great teacher to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,13519,15200,listen to your resentment is one of the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,15200,17760,best things you can possibly do
UpCBIF1Yl4k,17760,20480,resentment only means one of two things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,20480,22240,it means either like shut the hell up
UpCBIF1Yl4k,22240,24560,grow up quit whining and get on with it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,24560,26880,that's one thing it means or
UpCBIF1Yl4k,26880,29279,someone is playing the tyrant to you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,29279,30400,might even be you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,30400,32160,you have something to say and do that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,32160,34079,you should say and do to put it to a
UpCBIF1Yl4k,34079,35120,stop
UpCBIF1Yl4k,35120,37520,and so maybe resentment can show you the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,37520,38879,pathway to doing that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,38879,40480,like a resentful person wants other
UpCBIF1Yl4k,40480,42079,people to change
UpCBIF1Yl4k,42079,43680,and if you're resentful then your
UpCBIF1Yl4k,43680,45280,motivations aren't trustworthy in fact
UpCBIF1Yl4k,45280,47280,they're very very dark and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,47280,48719,what should you do instead how do you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,48719,50320,treat your own resentment i would say
UpCBIF1Yl4k,50320,51199,well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,51199,53680,solzhenitsyn who i'm a great i'm a great
UpCBIF1Yl4k,53680,54960,admirer of solzhenitsyn
UpCBIF1Yl4k,54960,56800,his book the gulag archipelago was one
UpCBIF1Yl4k,56800,57840,of the things that brought down the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,57840,58879,soviet union
UpCBIF1Yl4k,58879,60559,and he said that one man who stopped
UpCBIF1Yl4k,60559,62480,lying could bring down a tyranny
UpCBIF1Yl4k,62480,63920,and you know he said that with some
UpCBIF1Yl4k,63920,66240,authority and he said when he was in the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,66240,67280,gulag camps
UpCBIF1Yl4k,67280,69439,you know meditating on how the hell he
UpCBIF1Yl4k,69439,71200,got there he had a rough life man i mean
UpCBIF1Yl4k,71200,73280,first of all he was on the russian front
UpCBIF1Yl4k,73280,74640,at the beginning of world war ii and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,74640,76400,then he was thrown in the gulag camps
UpCBIF1Yl4k,76400,77840,and that was just the beginning of his
UpCBIF1Yl4k,77840,79759,adventures man he had a rough life
UpCBIF1Yl4k,79759,81840,he was in the camps he was thinking what
UpCBIF1Yl4k,81840,84080,the hell how did i get here what's going
UpCBIF1Yl4k,84080,84640,on
UpCBIF1Yl4k,84640,87040,and he had hitler and stalin to blame
UpCBIF1Yl4k,87040,88159,right so if you have
UpCBIF1Yl4k,88159,90159,if you need someone to blame man hitler
UpCBIF1Yl4k,90159,91840,and stellan that that's great
UpCBIF1Yl4k,91840,94320,but he that isn't what he did he said he
UpCBIF1Yl4k,94320,96240,meditated for a while once he realized
UpCBIF1Yl4k,96240,98400,that he might have something to do with
UpCBIF1Yl4k,98400,100079,in some strange way with the way things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,100079,101600,turned out for him and he said he went
UpCBIF1Yl4k,101600,102320,over his life
UpCBIF1Yl4k,102320,104799,with a fine-tooth comb in his memory he
UpCBIF1Yl4k,104799,106399,thought okay
UpCBIF1Yl4k,106399,108399,where did i go wrong but by my own
UpCBIF1Yl4k,108399,110320,judgment when there was a path in front
UpCBIF1Yl4k,110320,111360,of me
UpCBIF1Yl4k,111360,113119,when did i take the path that i knew i
UpCBIF1Yl4k,113119,114799,shouldn't take because you all know that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,114799,116399,right you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,116399,117680,sometimes you don't know if what you're
UpCBIF1Yl4k,117680,120079,doing is good or if it's bad
UpCBIF1Yl4k,120079,121759,it's just ignorance you just don't know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,121759,123520,but sometimes you bloody well know and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,123520,124719,you do the thing you know you shouldn't
UpCBIF1Yl4k,124719,125439,do anyways
UpCBIF1Yl4k,125439,128560,that happens a lot and why do you do
UpCBIF1Yl4k,128560,129200,that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,129200,131520,spike is part of it stupidity there's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,131520,132800,all sorts of reasons but you certainly
UpCBIF1Yl4k,132800,133680,know you do it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,133680,135280,solzhenitsyn thought okay what would
UpCBIF1Yl4k,135280,137680,happen if i took responsibility for
UpCBIF1Yl4k,137680,140239,where i am in this concentration camp
UpCBIF1Yl4k,140239,141760,and then i went over my whole life and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,141760,143520,tried to figure out all the things i did
UpCBIF1Yl4k,143520,145840,that were wrong by my own estimation
UpCBIF1Yl4k,145840,147360,that increased the probability that i
UpCBIF1Yl4k,147360,148959,would get here and then what would
UpCBIF1Yl4k,148959,150879,happen if i tried to set them all right
UpCBIF1Yl4k,150879,153360,now in the present and that's why he
UpCBIF1Yl4k,153360,154720,wrote the google like archipelago and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,154720,156000,one of the consequences of that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,156000,158800,as i said was it sped the dissolution of
UpCBIF1Yl4k,158800,160959,the soviet empire so hey that's not bad
UpCBIF1Yl4k,160959,161599,eh like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,161599,163840,you make a real confession you really
UpCBIF1Yl4k,163840,164720,repent
UpCBIF1Yl4k,164720,166640,you you do your penance which is writing
UpCBIF1Yl4k,166640,168879,this book and you completely change the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,168879,171519,geopolitical landscape of the world
UpCBIF1Yl4k,171519,173519,it's like and that that's worth thinking
UpCBIF1Yl4k,173519,175280,about because it's not only solzhenitsyn
UpCBIF1Yl4k,175280,176720,who did that nelson mandela did
UpCBIF1Yl4k,176720,177920,something quite similar
UpCBIF1Yl4k,177920,181280,it's not so impossible and so the idea
UpCBIF1Yl4k,181280,182239,that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,182239,183680,what you should do if you're feeling
UpCBIF1Yl4k,183680,186159,resentful about the nature of being or
UpCBIF1Yl4k,186159,187599,suffering too much for your own life
UpCBIF1Yl4k,187599,188319,let's say is
UpCBIF1Yl4k,188319,190239,straighten the damn thing out like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,190239,192400,seriously try it for a year even
UpCBIF1Yl4k,192400,195519,try it for a week try not doing the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,195519,197599,things you know you shouldn't do
UpCBIF1Yl4k,197599,201040,try not saying the things you know to be
UpCBIF1Yl4k,201040,203599,false and just watch what happens you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,203599,205200,might as well give it a shot right
UpCBIF1Yl4k,205200,205680,because
UpCBIF1Yl4k,205680,207840,you say well i'm all in for a year you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,207840,209920,know i'm going to do things right
UpCBIF1Yl4k,209920,211599,and then i'll just stand back and kind
UpCBIF1Yl4k,211599,213440,of watch how things unfold
UpCBIF1Yl4k,213440,216159,and maybe i'll reconsider at the end of
UpCBIF1Yl4k,216159,217440,that year it's like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,217440,220560,try it try it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,220560,222959,i mean i would say i've had thousands of
UpCBIF1Yl4k,222959,224319,letters now from people
UpCBIF1Yl4k,224319,226000,who are saying hey i tried that you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,226000,228959,and hey you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,228959,232480,worked i read this great line in the t.s
UpCBIF1Yl4k,232480,235599,eliot play called the cocktail party
UpCBIF1Yl4k,235599,237439,and in it this woman comes up to a
UpCBIF1Yl4k,237439,239040,psychiatrist and she says
UpCBIF1Yl4k,239040,240400,you know i'm having a really rough time
UpCBIF1Yl4k,240400,242239,of it i'm suffering badly my life is not
UpCBIF1Yl4k,242239,243200,going well and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,243200,245280,then she says uh i hope that there's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,245280,247040,something wrong with me
UpCBIF1Yl4k,247040,248879,and the psychiatrist says what the hell
UpCBIF1Yl4k,248879,250560,do you mean by that and she says well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,250560,252080,here's how i look at it there's either
UpCBIF1Yl4k,252080,254879,something wrong with the world and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,254879,257040,i'm just in it and that's how it is and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,257040,257919,then like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,257919,259280,what am i going to do about that because
UpCBIF1Yl4k,259280,261040,it's the whole world or maybe
UpCBIF1Yl4k,261040,262160,i could be fortunate and there's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,262160,264080,something wrong with me that's causing
UpCBIF1Yl4k,264080,265840,all this unnecessary suffering and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,265840,268080,if i i could just set it right i could
UpCBIF1Yl4k,268080,270400,learn and i could set it right
UpCBIF1Yl4k,270400,273199,and so well i've been thinking about
UpCBIF1Yl4k,273199,274880,that for a very long time and i think
UpCBIF1Yl4k,274880,275280,well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,275280,277040,if your life isn't going the way it is
UpCBIF1Yl4k,277040,278960,you know you can find someone else to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,278960,279680,blame
UpCBIF1Yl4k,279680,281440,which is pretty convenient for you and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,281440,282880,also relatively easy
UpCBIF1Yl4k,282880,286960,or you could think okay i don't like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,286960,289040,life i don't like the way my life is
UpCBIF1Yl4k,289040,290720,unfolding
UpCBIF1Yl4k,290720,292240,maybe i don't like life in general
UpCBIF1Yl4k,292240,294000,because it's tragic and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,294000,297199,and tainted with evil how do i know if
UpCBIF1Yl4k,297199,299600,my judgment is accurate
UpCBIF1Yl4k,299600,300880,and the question is well have i really
UpCBIF1Yl4k,300880,302960,done everything i possibly could to set
UpCBIF1Yl4k,302960,304639,my life straight
UpCBIF1Yl4k,304639,306880,because maybe i shouldn't be judging it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,306880,308720,it's quality or the quality of life
UpCBIF1Yl4k,308720,310000,itself or being itself
UpCBIF1Yl4k,310000,311759,for that matter if i haven't done
UpCBIF1Yl4k,311759,314000,everything i possibly could
UpCBIF1Yl4k,314000,317360,to set my life straight well so there's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,317360,317840,a
UpCBIF1Yl4k,317840,321440,there's a task the humility element is
UpCBIF1Yl4k,321440,323520,it took me a long time to understand why
UpCBIF1Yl4k,323520,325440,there's religious injunctions
UpCBIF1Yl4k,325440,328000,supporting humility to even understand
UpCBIF1Yl4k,328000,329360,what the word really meant in that sort
UpCBIF1Yl4k,329360,330639,of technical sense and it means
UpCBIF1Yl4k,330639,332000,something like this it means
UpCBIF1Yl4k,332000,333360,what you don't know is more important
UpCBIF1Yl4k,333360,335680,than what you know then then what you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,335680,337199,don't know can start to be your friend
UpCBIF1Yl4k,337199,339039,you see people are very defensive about
UpCBIF1Yl4k,339039,340160,what they know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,340160,343280,but the thing is you don't know enough
UpCBIF1Yl4k,343280,344800,and the re you can tell you don't know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,344800,346560,enough because your life is not what it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,346560,347199,could be
UpCBIF1Yl4k,347199,348880,and neither is the life of the people
UpCBIF1Yl4k,348880,351520,around you you just don't know enough
UpCBIF1Yl4k,351520,353919,and so what that means is that every
UpCBIF1Yl4k,353919,355600,time you encounter
UpCBIF1Yl4k,355600,357600,some evidence that you're ignorant
UpCBIF1Yl4k,357600,358800,someone points it out you should be
UpCBIF1Yl4k,358800,360479,happy about that because you think oh
UpCBIF1Yl4k,360479,363360,you just told me how i'm wrong it's like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,363360,363919,great
UpCBIF1Yl4k,363919,365680,like maybe i had to sift through a lot
UpCBIF1Yl4k,365680,367440,of nonsense to get through the real
UpCBIF1Yl4k,367440,368560,message that you're
UpCBIF1Yl4k,368560,369919,telling me but if you could actually
UpCBIF1Yl4k,369919,371759,tell me some way that i'm wrong and then
UpCBIF1Yl4k,371759,373520,maybe give me a hint about how to not be
UpCBIF1Yl4k,373520,374400,wrong like that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,374400,375600,well then i wouldn't have to be wrong
UpCBIF1Yl4k,375600,377520,like that anymore that that would be a
UpCBIF1Yl4k,377520,378560,good thing
UpCBIF1Yl4k,378560,380560,you can embark on that adventure by
UpCBIF1Yl4k,380560,381840,listening to people
UpCBIF1Yl4k,381840,383360,and if you listen to people they will
UpCBIF1Yl4k,383360,386080,tell you they'll tell you amazing things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,386080,387520,if you listen to them and many of those
UpCBIF1Yl4k,387520,388000,things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,388000,389360,are little tools that you can put in
UpCBIF1Yl4k,389360,391039,your toolkit like batman and then you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,391039,392479,can go out into the world and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,392479,394080,use those tools and you don't have to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,394080,395840,fall blindly into a pit
UpCBIF1Yl4k,395840,398160,quite as often and so the humility
UpCBIF1Yl4k,398160,399759,element is well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,399759,402000,do you want to be right or do you want
UpCBIF1Yl4k,402000,403759,to be learning
UpCBIF1Yl4k,403759,405440,and then it's deeper than that it's do
UpCBIF1Yl4k,405440,408240,you want to be the tyrannical king who's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,408240,410160,already got everything figured out
UpCBIF1Yl4k,410160,411919,or do you want to be the continually
UpCBIF1Yl4k,411919,413280,transforming hero
UpCBIF1Yl4k,413280,415360,or fool for that matter who's getting
UpCBIF1Yl4k,415360,417120,better all the time
UpCBIF1Yl4k,417120,420080,and that's actually a choice you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,420080,421280,it's a deep choice
UpCBIF1Yl4k,421280,423240,and it's better to be the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,423240,424800,self-transforming fool
UpCBIF1Yl4k,424800,427120,who's humble enough to make friends with
UpCBIF1Yl4k,427120,428720,what he or she doesn't know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,428720,431120,and to listen when people talk and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,431120,433039,listening is a transformative exercise
UpCBIF1Yl4k,433039,433599,like if
UpCBIF1Yl4k,433599,435520,if you listen to the people in your life
UpCBIF1Yl4k,435520,436960,for example if you actually listen to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,436960,437599,them
UpCBIF1Yl4k,437599,439280,they'll tell you what's wrong with them
UpCBIF1Yl4k,439280,441199,and how to fix it and what they want
UpCBIF1Yl4k,441199,442720,they can't even help it if you start
UpCBIF1Yl4k,442720,444240,listening because people are so
UpCBIF1Yl4k,444240,446080,shocked if you actually listen to them
UpCBIF1Yl4k,446080,447599,that they tell you all
UpCBIF1Yl4k,447599,448880,sorts of things that they might not have
UpCBIF1Yl4k,448880,450720,even intended to things they don't even
UpCBIF1Yl4k,450720,451440,know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,451440,454160,and then you can you can work with that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,454160,455199,and the other thing that's so
UpCBIF1Yl4k,455199,456160,interesting you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,456160,457360,now and then you have a meaningful
UpCBIF1Yl4k,457360,459120,conversation right you have a good
UpCBIF1Yl4k,459120,460560,conversation with somebody you walk when
UpCBIF1Yl4k,460560,461680,you think geez you know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,461680,464080,we really connected and i know more than
UpCBIF1Yl4k,464080,465360,i did when i came away from that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,465360,466160,conversation
UpCBIF1Yl4k,466160,467520,and during the conversation you're
UpCBIF1Yl4k,467520,469280,really engrossed in it
UpCBIF1Yl4k,469280,471759,and that feeling of being engrossed is a
UpCBIF1Yl4k,471759,472960,feeling of meaning and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,472960,474560,the feeling of meaning is engendered
UpCBIF1Yl4k,474560,476240,because you're having a transformative
UpCBIF1Yl4k,476240,477120,conversation
UpCBIF1Yl4k,477120,478639,your brain produces that feeling of
UpCBIF1Yl4k,478639,480319,meaning for it says oh yeah
UpCBIF1Yl4k,480319,481599,this is exactly where you should be
UpCBIF1Yl4k,481599,484319,right here now it's the right place and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,484319,485360,time for you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,485360,487680,and that's a great place to occupy and
UpCBIF1Yl4k,487680,489599,so a good conversation where
UpCBIF1Yl4k,489599,491680,people are listening has exactly that
UpCBIF1Yl4k,491680,493280,nature and the reason it has that nature
UpCBIF1Yl4k,493280,495360,is because it is in fact transformative
UpCBIF1Yl4k,495360,497360,it's one of the truisms of clinical
UpCBIF1Yl4k,497360,498400,psychology like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,498400,500720,if you're a clinical psychologist a huge
UpCBIF1Yl4k,500720,502160,part of what you do is just listen to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,502160,503120,people
UpCBIF1Yl4k,503120,505360,it's like you know they come in they're
UpCBIF1Yl4k,505360,506400,unhappy
UpCBIF1Yl4k,506400,508160,and they'd rather not be something like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,508160,509759,that you say well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,509759,511919,why do you think you might be unhappy
UpCBIF1Yl4k,511919,512880,and they don't know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,512880,514560,they have some ideas they may have to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,514560,516479,ramble around for like a year before
UpCBIF1Yl4k,516479,518320,they figure out why they're unhappy
UpCBIF1Yl4k,518320,520640,they get rid of a bunch of reasons why
UpCBIF1Yl4k,520640,522240,they thought they were unhappy that are
UpCBIF1Yl4k,522240,523599,untrue and then you kind of get to the
UpCBIF1Yl4k,523599,524800,heart of the problem
UpCBIF1Yl4k,524800,526959,then you might ask them well if you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,526959,528399,could have what you wanted
UpCBIF1Yl4k,528399,530640,so that your life would be okay what
UpCBIF1Yl4k,530640,531760,would that look like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,531760,533440,then they have to ramble around a bunch
UpCBIF1Yl4k,533440,534720,about that because they don't really
UpCBIF1Yl4k,534720,535200,know
UpCBIF1Yl4k,535200,537519,but the listening will straighten them
UpCBIF1Yl4k,537519,540000,out because people think by talking
UpCBIF1Yl4k,540000,541760,and in order to think you have to have
UpCBIF1Yl4k,541760,543040,someone to listen because
UpCBIF1Yl4k,543040,545040,it's very hard to think hardly anyone
UpCBIF1Yl4k,545040,546959,can think and even the people who can
UpCBIF1Yl4k,546959,548560,think can only think about a limited
UpCBIF1Yl4k,548560,549600,number of things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,549600,551760,but almost everybody can talk and you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,551760,552880,can listen to yourself
UpCBIF1Yl4k,552880,554959,talk and if someone listens to you then
UpCBIF1Yl4k,554959,555920,well then
UpCBIF1Yl4k,555920,558000,you also have a foil for your thoughts
UpCBIF1Yl4k,558000,559440,right because you can watch the person
UpCBIF1Yl4k,559440,560720,when you're talking and see if you're
UpCBIF1Yl4k,560720,562480,boring or see if you're amusing or
UpCBIF1Yl4k,562480,566000,if you're engrossing all of those things
UpCBIF1Yl4k,566000,567519,so like if you're arguing with your wife
UpCBIF1Yl4k,567519,569279,let's say or your husband
UpCBIF1Yl4k,569279,571680,big party is going to want to win that's
UpCBIF1Yl4k,571680,572720,stupid because
UpCBIF1Yl4k,572720,574560,because you don't want that you want to
UpCBIF1Yl4k,574560,576000,you want to defeat your wife
UpCBIF1Yl4k,576000,578399,in an argument oh well great like if she
UpCBIF1Yl4k,578399,580080,was going to disappear tomorrow
UpCBIF1Yl4k,580080,582880,no problem but like you're going to like
UpCBIF1Yl4k,582880,583600,live with
UpCBIF1Yl4k,583600,586320,defeated miserable her for the next week
UpCBIF1Yl4k,586320,587360,that's no good
UpCBIF1Yl4k,587360,589040,so you listen and you think okay well
UpCBIF1Yl4k,589040,591040,here's here's what you what i think you
UpCBIF1Yl4k,591040,592640,said and maybe even make it a little
UpCBIF1Yl4k,592640,595200,stronger and more elaborated than was
UpCBIF1Yl4k,595200,597040,the case with the original utterance so
UpCBIF1Yl4k,597040,599120,that you get the damn argument right
UpCBIF1Yl4k,599120,600560,because you don't want to win you want
UpCBIF1Yl4k,600560,602399,to fix the problem
UpCBIF1Yl4k,602399,604410,that's the winning
UpCBIF1Yl4k,604410,619928,[Music]
UpCBIF1Yl4k,629200,631279,you
