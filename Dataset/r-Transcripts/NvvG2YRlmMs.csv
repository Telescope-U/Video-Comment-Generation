NvvG2YRlmMs,11920,18800,you guys along also i've kind of already had  a pretty defeating morning because last night  
NvvG2YRlmMs,19360,26320,i wrote out this schedule i was gonna wake up at  seven go to the gym shower be done with all of  
NvvG2YRlmMs,26320,35200,that by 8 30 do a face mask and make breakfast be  done with that by 9 30 and then get on to doing my  
NvvG2YRlmMs,35200,43840,homework before i leave to school at 11 30 for  my first class and i woke up at nine today so  
NvvG2YRlmMs,45040,50720,every time i set an alarm or like plan  to wake up early and then i miss it and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,50720,57680,sleep in for an hour or two i just feel so  bad and it like messes up my whole schedule  
NvvG2YRlmMs,57680,71840,for the day but i'm slowly learning to just not  fight my body and give her the rest she needs
NvvG2YRlmMs,126880,134560,i'm heading back home right now because i forgot  my lunch that i packed and i just knew that this  
NvvG2YRlmMs,134560,141840,was gonna happen and i specifically put the  bag right next to the door and i still forgot
NvvG2YRlmMs,155200,157920,honestly it feels so good to come back home and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,159040,165439,like be able to eat my food in my own space and  just take a little break in between classes even  
NvvG2YRlmMs,165440,183840,though i am sitting on my floor eating lukewarm  noodles at least i'm sitting on MY floor you know
NvvG2YRlmMs,258560,262880,i was planning on cooking some stuff for  dinner tonight but it's so late now and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,263600,268560,i still have so much to do so i just  made this from trader joe's and it smells  
NvvG2YRlmMs,268560,277000,so good and i'm just pairing it with some brown  rice that i made a few days ago bon appetit
NvvG2YRlmMs,277000,282240,it is a gloomy and really rainy day today
NvvG2YRlmMs,293040,299920,i just had a meeting with my advisor and we talked  a little bit about course registration because  
NvvG2YRlmMs,300560,306160,we have to register for our spring semester  courses next week and i'm so excited  
NvvG2YRlmMs,306160,313120,to take new classes and we're going to  be going into our different pathways and
NvvG2YRlmMs,315280,320720,at first i really had no idea what i wanted  it to do like i wanted to do systems and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,321520,325840,and then i was thinking of materiality and then  i was like no i'm gonna do collection but the  
NvvG2YRlmMs,325840,330720,thing that i have the most trouble with every  single time is picking an elective just because  
NvvG2YRlmMs,330720,339920,my interests are so broad and so many classes look  so interesting that i have a very difficult time  
NvvG2YRlmMs,340640,345920,narrowing it down to just a few and then of course  they always end up being full by the time that i  
NvvG2YRlmMs,345920,351840,register and then i end up picking a not so great  class oh and also we talked about study abroad and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,352960,356880,i really want to do study abroad  but there's only two options for  
NvvG2YRlmMs,356880,363200,the fashion design major right now and i'm not  particularly interested in either so i don't  
NvvG2YRlmMs,363200,368560,know if i'm gonna do study abroad after all  but i really hope they add some more options  
NvvG2YRlmMs,368560,375280,for the future i feel like i'm sharing so  much and like does anybody actually even care  
NvvG2YRlmMs,376560,382480,i don't know but i'm excited and i don't  have a roommate that i can bother so  
NvvG2YRlmMs,384080,393840,i guess you guys are stuck listening  to me talk about course registration
NvvG2YRlmMs,396880,401680,i just finished cutting out the pieces  on muslin so that i can sew a rough draft  
NvvG2YRlmMs,402480,407840,and i'm gonna do a part of it right now  and then sew the rest when i get to school
NvvG2YRlmMs,418720,424320,just realizing now how slow my machine is  compared to the industrial ones at school
NvvG2YRlmMs,431280,435840,okay i have exactly one hour to get this done
NvvG2YRlmMs,483520,487680,rushing home because it's going  to start raining in 20 minutes
NvvG2YRlmMs,488720,495040,i made way too much food for dinner and  then i ended up eating way too much and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,496000,505840,now i'm bloated and uncomfortable
NvvG2YRlmMs,522960,526080,it's not sunday but we are  doing some self-caring today  
NvvG2YRlmMs,526640,533840,with a refreshing face mask  before i go make breakfast
NvvG2YRlmMs,562000,568400,guys it's my first time in a new york cab
NvvG2YRlmMs,637040,643519,hi guys i came down to the building's  dining room area today to eat lunch before  
NvvG2YRlmMs,644080,650560,heading back to school for my sewing class this  evening which i am very excited for it's thursday  
NvvG2YRlmMs,650560,658320,today which is my most packed day of classes  and my elective class was this morning and we're  
NvvG2YRlmMs,658320,665120,doing a big group project where we're supposed  to do a whole fashion editorial photo shoot and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,665120,674560,then make a magazine comprised of like 35 pages  and my partner my amazing partner decided that  
NvvG2YRlmMs,674560,687840,she's gonna drop the class today and so now i'm  left alone doing the entire project by myself
NvvG2YRlmMs,792800,799839,made a big plate of noodle stir-fry
NvvG2YRlmMs,802000,808320,hi guys so i spent like eight hours in  studio yesterday and i was so exhausted that  
NvvG2YRlmMs,809360,814640,i came back home ate dinner and just  completely knocked out i didn't sew  
NvvG2YRlmMs,814640,821200,anything really yesterday but i got a lot done  actually i cut out all my fabric pieces and  
NvvG2YRlmMs,822000,829120,i did the most tedious part which is the  pleats for the bottom half of the shirt  
NvvG2YRlmMs,830000,836960,i finished both sides and i was thinking  of doing like i've been really getting into  
NvvG2YRlmMs,838000,845600,materiality and like embroidery and beading and  such so i was thinking of doing some beading  
NvvG2YRlmMs,845600,850800,either along the top hem here or the  bottom hem of the shirt i'm about to  
NvvG2YRlmMs,850800,855839,head out right now i'm going to go to  michael's and try to look for some beads
