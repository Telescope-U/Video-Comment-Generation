ca4ImOJjBJI,530080,536959,best in this last 25 26 days we are yet  to complete the balance four days
ca4ImOJjBJI,536959,542720,the best part about this entire credit  which we are doing the implementation  probably we can say that the

ca4ImOJjBJI,547839,553120,not just we are taking a feedback in the  process  india
ca4ImOJjBJI,553120,558560,to work towards our future of profession  we have to be very vigilant in the

ca4ImOJjBJI,587760,594080,positive suggestions which have been  received as you all we all live in a  democratic country it is not going to be
ca4ImOJjBJI,594080,599519,such democratic that you know if the  maximum number of people are going to  agree it will be you know taken into
ca4ImOJjBJI,599519,605600,account even if a single suggestion  which is going to be given which is  going to be an exception in the entire
ca4ImOJjBJI,605600,611760,process will also be considered  deliberated in the board of studies  meeting as well as in the council and

ca4ImOJjBJI,824800,830560,clarification with this we can actually  start the session and discussion based  on the case by case
ca4ImOJjBJI,830560,837120,basis money over to you thank you all  thank you very much for joining me  thank you sir  uh nasa will start with the question
ca4ImOJjBJI,837120,843760,answer so first question i'll be posing  it to the vice chairman sir  i think it's very close to his heart
ca4ImOJjBJI,843760,849600,because  during his interactive sessions with  members and students he has been facing
ca4ImOJjBJI,849600,855360,this question time and again  so this this question is why is there is
ca4ImOJjBJI,855360,862720,a decrease in number of leaves during  articleship  aspirants need time to study apart from
ca4ImOJjBJI,862720,865199,articles
ca4ImOJjBJI,868560,870800,sorry
ca4ImOJjBJI,880720,883720,okay
ca4ImOJjBJI,888720,896079,rightly mentioned that in the proposed  scheme the number of leaves have been  reduced to 12 in a year
ca4ImOJjBJI,896079,902639,and i would say that as a number that  does look reduced  if i look at the current situation the
ca4ImOJjBJI,902639,907760,present scheme that we are having  uh  you know
ca4ImOJjBJI,907760,915440,actually we are having the similar  number of leaves per year that we say  for the article students and how do i
ca4ImOJjBJI,915440,920720,justify that or how do i explain that  presently if we see that the regulations
ca4ImOJjBJI,920720,926079,provide that in a three year article  shape the number of eligible leaves is
ca4ImOJjBJI,926079,931920,one seventh of the number of present  days  which will arithmetically all of us know
ca4ImOJjBJI,931920,937040,it works out to 156 days over a three  year period
ca4ImOJjBJI,937040,943839,because in the present scheme we have  the final examinations that a student  can appear in the last six months of his
ca4ImOJjBJI,943839,948959,or her articleship it is expected that a  student would proceed for the exam study
ca4ImOJjBJI,948959,954160,leads  and as a benchmark  you know i can put that at least four
ca4ImOJjBJI,954160,962079,months is the period of uh that the  student would go on on exam preparation  day or exam study practice and
ca4ImOJjBJI,962079,968720,this time being very conservative as far  as the final examination is concerned so  if i put four months to it it works out
ca4ImOJjBJI,968720,974320,to 120 days  so from the 156 days of eligible beef
ca4ImOJjBJI,974320,980959,that the student has  if i deduct 120 days what we are left  with is 36 days
ca4ImOJjBJI,980959,986639,now 36 days over a three year period  works out to 12 days in a year and what
ca4ImOJjBJI,986639,994000,is that is what has been proposed in the  new scheme of educational training where  we have proposed 12 days in a year or 24
ca4ImOJjBJI,994000,999839,days over the two  practical training  and this i am being very conservative we
ca4ImOJjBJI,999839,1004880,know in the current scheme we have  uh students who would have cleared one
ca4ImOJjBJI,1004880,1012000,group of inter uh intermediate exam  would have joined article ship so they  would go on uh leave for the second
ca4ImOJjBJI,1012000,1018160,group uh which i have not factored in  this calculation uh there would be  students who might be taking more than
ca4ImOJjBJI,1018160,1023199,four months leave also for preparing for  the final examination which i have not
ca4ImOJjBJI,1023199,1029918,taken into this calculation this is a  very very conservative estimate of 120  days  for that is four months for the final
ca4ImOJjBJI,1029918,1036640,examination  so if we look from this perspective that  presently also uh over a year a student
ca4ImOJjBJI,1036640,1043199,gets 12 days of leave and that is what  has been proposed in this new scheme of  education and training so it is not that
ca4ImOJjBJI,1043199,1049120,the from the institute or board of  studies we have reduced the leap we have  kept it at par it's just that number
ca4ImOJjBJI,1049120,1055840,which looks smaller in uh when we look  at it that that is what would be my  response from it
ca4ImOJjBJI,1055840,1061120,thank you sir i think sir with uh this  answer of yours clarification i think
ca4ImOJjBJI,1061120,1066960,the students uh will now will be feeling  at ease yes that uh this particular uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,1066960,1074799,number of links have been very justified  which has been proposed by the uh  council sir thank you sir sir uh now
ca4ImOJjBJI,1074799,1080880,i'll start uh with a section wise i'll  start with the foundation uh so first
ca4ImOJjBJI,1080880,1087120,and now i'll pose this question to the  chairman sir  sir uh the students are there is a
ca4ImOJjBJI,1087120,1092640,there is a doubt in the mind the people  as to why  the paper on business correspondence and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1092640,1098080,reporting has been removed  they felt that uh this is uh important
ca4ImOJjBJI,1098080,1103120,for assessing the communication skills  of the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,1104000,1111039,ah thank you very much if you have  another questions for the foundation to  put it together i can combine it
ca4ImOJjBJI,1111039,1116160,and we can actually clarify at one  shortfall  sure
ca4ImOJjBJI,1116160,1121360,sir then i i'll go to the next question  which is again a subject related
ca4ImOJjBJI,1121360,1128240,is business and commercial knowledge  been removed  from paper 4  then why is mathematics is being
ca4ImOJjBJI,1128240,1134720,continued  at foundation level  and why is economics being included for
ca4ImOJjBJI,1134720,1142559,100 marks  in the ca uh curriculum at foundation  level what is its relevance so these are
ca4ImOJjBJI,1142559,1148880,all the uh four questions relating to  the subjects at the foundation level
ca4ImOJjBJI,1148880,1155679,yeah that's the reason i wanted to check  when i'm on the foundation level if we  can get a 360 degree view we can  actually talk on the foundation at one
ca4ImOJjBJI,1155679,1161120,go  and uh we'll conclude that uh foundation  part because i don't think in foundation
ca4ImOJjBJI,1161120,1166640,side many people have  questions but apart from as you rightly  said business correspondence and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1166640,1172880,reporting friends has been removed from  a point of view two things  uh we are for the first time are
ca4ImOJjBJI,1172880,1178320,introducing the concept of self-paced  learning which is going to be an  experiential learning for all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1178320,1184559,students not only at the  intermediate foundation level but also  for the intermediate and final level and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1184559,1190160,not only this let me tell you this  thought has come when we actually  clocked
ca4ImOJjBJI,1190160,1195760,97 years of learning in one year when we  implement a digital learning hub that
ca4ImOJjBJI,1195760,1201840,means the adoption of technology for  learning has been good at the institute
ca4ImOJjBJI,1201840,1209440,level and the remote students like when  you talk about board of studies app  we have got 2 lakh 50 000 students who
ca4ImOJjBJI,1209440,1216400,are downloaded the us app which is  having live coaching classes  so considering all these factors a
ca4ImOJjBJI,1216400,1221600,thought is being put that you know when  we want to focus on a foundation course
ca4ImOJjBJI,1221600,1226640,when you talk about economics  business business laws has to be read in
ca4ImOJjBJI,1226640,1232480,independence versus the uh you know  the  uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,1232480,1238640,the other word which has been i'm  missing out uh to  this communication right
ca4ImOJjBJI,1238640,1242400,ah  what is that uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,1243760,1249520,is this correspondence yeah  the respondents are reporting i'm sorry  i i slipped my mind
ca4ImOJjBJI,1249520,1254880,so business correspondence i'm reporting  when you talk from a point of view of  student who have come from a different
ca4ImOJjBJI,1254880,1260799,cities where their basic education has  been good so for those people and the  people who are coming from a different
ca4ImOJjBJI,1260799,1267600,uh you know sex section  is actually getting imbalance so the  focus should be on business laws that is
ca4ImOJjBJI,1267600,1274559,the reason business laws has been put  students who have been on a weaker side  with regards to english as a  communication we are going to new to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1274559,1280159,move the concept towards a self-paced  learning module where at any given point
ca4ImOJjBJI,1280159,1285280,in time anytime a student can learn  english very effectively which is going
ca4ImOJjBJI,1285280,1291760,to be against experiential learning the  second part was with regards to business
ca4ImOJjBJI,1291760,1298400,what was the mathematical commercial  knowledge  so yesterday  business and commercial knowledge so
ca4ImOJjBJI,1298400,1304559,business and commercial knowledge has  been covered so now the third part is  mathematics mathematics yeah the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1304559,1310240,mathematics yeah so mathematics if you  see uh even in the 11th and 12th what is
ca4ImOJjBJI,1310240,1316000,happening is most of the brilliant  students who are not good in mathematics  would like to go for civics economics
ca4ImOJjBJI,1316000,1321600,and commerce  so what is happening is that mathematics  the fear of mathematics might be pulling
ca4ImOJjBJI,1321600,1327919,our student away but that is not only  the solution which we were thinking but  we were also thinking logical reasoning
ca4ImOJjBJI,1327919,1333360,and the working of  use of mathematics in a workable  environment for a chartered accountant
ca4ImOJjBJI,1333360,1339200,as a commerce education  they have to be  you know effectively utilizing so the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1339200,1344240,entire mathematics curriculum is not  only mathematics but also statistics and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1344240,1351039,logical reasoning which has been put in  so the focus is not going to be on the  technology and other kind of calculus
ca4ImOJjBJI,1351039,1356960,and all those things but whereas now  usable mathematics for the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,1356960,1364480,which is used for the accountants will  only be focused area for us and last one  was with regards to richmond madam
ca4ImOJjBJI,1364480,1369520,economics  economics so if you see economics we
ca4ImOJjBJI,1369520,1376000,actually are looking into a student  level where the economics is effectively  learned at the foundation level itself
ca4ImOJjBJI,1376000,1383600,might be a portion of it which is moving  out  is only going to be replaced with the  global economics also example not
ca4ImOJjBJI,1383600,1388880,something in depth but might be we are  going to talk about from where the  exports happen where the input happened
ca4ImOJjBJI,1388880,1394720,where india is strong which is the other  country from where the natural resources  or another things are there so the basic
ca4ImOJjBJI,1394720,1401440,fundamental of economics and global  economics will be part of the foundation  syllabus so what will happen friends in
ca4ImOJjBJI,1401440,1408080,this entire process is we are not trying  to eliminate anything please don't  understand we are just ensuring that
ca4ImOJjBJI,1408080,1415520,what was relevant at that time continued  that time what is relevant for the time  to come we are trying to just realign
ca4ImOJjBJI,1415520,1421039,the entire learning experience for the  student so that foundation also becomes
ca4ImOJjBJI,1421039,1426080,logical in the entire learning process  so this is in total the realignment of
ca4ImOJjBJI,1426080,1431919,foundation course as such  what do you mean  thank you sir thank you sir uh i think
ca4ImOJjBJI,1431919,1438880,students uh and members you would have  really know you'll appreciate  why uh certain subjects have been
ca4ImOJjBJI,1438880,1445360,included why the marks have been  increased and why certain subjects have  been removed because as such they have
ca4ImOJjBJI,1445360,1453200,not been removed they have just been  realigned  keeping in mind  the uh the scenario and the years to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1453200,1458640,come and the relevance of the subjects  uh so now uh vice chairman said i'll
ca4ImOJjBJI,1458640,1464640,come to uh on the other part of the  foundation  uh about the like uh we have increased
ca4ImOJjBJI,1464640,1472400,now the past percentage now from uh  forty percent in each subject but  overall fifty percent to 50
ca4ImOJjBJI,1472400,1480320,in each paper  and the second is why uh we are still  continuing with the negative marking for
ca4ImOJjBJI,1480320,1485360,mcq based questions  and why still we are continuing with the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1485360,1491360,paper pattern of two papers being  subjective and two papers being  objective type
ca4ImOJjBJI,1491360,1496400,and said last part also if you permit me  i'll cover that also that's on the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1496400,1503360,validity the validity of registry  the registration is now for four years
ca4ImOJjBJI,1503360,1510240,uh why uh there is nothing like there is  uh there is a limit this time  why our students are not allowed to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1510240,1514880,revalidate after four years step
ca4ImOJjBJI,1520799,1527919,uh that is being increased to 50 percent  in each of the paper from the present  for people 17 each and 50 percent in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1527919,1535520,aggregate the reason is to  ensure that the student has the  requisite aptitude each each of the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1535520,1542080,subject uh because the four subjects  they are of a  different uh the nature and the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1542080,1549919,background like the honor the chairman's  have just mentioned uh you know just to  ensure that uh the requisite aptitude is
ca4ImOJjBJI,1549919,1557279,same at least the minimum across all the  papers fifty percent in each of the  paper is being stipulated coming to the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1557279,1564080,question on the negative marking  uh the reason negative marking presently  also is there in the foundation level
ca4ImOJjBJI,1564080,1569600,exam for the executes the 25 percent  negative marking for each of the wrong  mcqs
ca4ImOJjBJI,1569600,1577039,that is proposed to be carried forward  in the in the new scheme also and the  main reason for that is that
ca4ImOJjBJI,1577039,1582159,you know that is to prevent these  students from resorting to guesswork
ca4ImOJjBJI,1582159,1589440,while answering the questions it is  expected that the students should study  the subject properly should be able to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1589440,1594799,interpret analyze it properly and then  respond or answer by way of the mcqs
ca4ImOJjBJI,1594799,1601760,rather than resorting to guesswork so  this limit of this would minimize the  case work as far as the enthalpies is
ca4ImOJjBJI,1601760,1607200,concerned and that is why negative  marking is being continued at the  formulation level
ca4ImOJjBJI,1607200,1612480,coming to the combination of the  objective type and the descriptive type
ca4ImOJjBJI,1612480,1618480,the main logic i would say the main  reason behind that  is that as far as the descriptive type
ca4ImOJjBJI,1618480,1625840,is concerned the  reason is that it should help to assess  the communication skills of the student
ca4ImOJjBJI,1625840,1631840,in addition to helping them read and  understand the subject  that is there so
ca4ImOJjBJI,1631840,1638640,once a student reads and understands by  way of the descriptive answers the  student should be able to appear and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1638640,1645360,write and communicate that whatever  or she has understood uh in a  descriptive manner that is why two
ca4ImOJjBJI,1645360,1652240,papers are kept descriptive and the  other two papers are objective that is  just to ensure that the analytical
ca4ImOJjBJI,1652240,1657600,skills of the candidate is up to mark  this is why it is a combination it has
ca4ImOJjBJI,1657600,1663520,been balanced between the descriptive  and the objective type  at the foundation level so this also
ca4ImOJjBJI,1663520,1669039,balances the difficulty level  of the various papers that are there
ca4ImOJjBJI,1669039,1676799,coming to your last question  on the validity of registration uh that  now it is being uh proposed to four
ca4ImOJjBJI,1676799,1682720,years to be  restricted to four years without  any provision for revalidation
ca4ImOJjBJI,1682720,1688880,uh  see as the scheme uh envy suggests that  a student can register for foundation
ca4ImOJjBJI,1688880,1694080,after class 10  and  would be able to appear after class 12
ca4ImOJjBJI,1694080,1700799,so within four years of the registration  the  student is expected he or she would have
ca4ImOJjBJI,1700799,1708640,about four or five attempts to give uh  till the four years  of the registration expire and it is
ca4ImOJjBJI,1708640,1716320,expected that four to five attempts at  the foundation level of our cx exam uh  is sufficient enough for the student to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1716320,1723760,uh  i would say uh  pass  the  foundation exam and also uh have the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1723760,1730320,requisite skill sets  beyond four or five attempts arriving  beyond four years it is not that the
ca4ImOJjBJI,1730320,1735360,doors of the ca curriculum closes on the  student the student still has the option
ca4ImOJjBJI,1735360,1740640,of the direct entry  from the graduation or the  post-graduation
ca4ImOJjBJI,1740640,1747840,levels from the exams by getting the  requisite percentage the student can  still find the clear curriculum through
ca4ImOJjBJI,1747840,1755120,the direct entry route if he or she is  not able to  join or  pass from the foundation level
ca4ImOJjBJI,1755120,1760559,so this is why it is being restricted to  four years without any revalidation at
ca4ImOJjBJI,1760559,1766960,present at the foundation level  thank you  thank you sir thank you
ca4ImOJjBJI,1766960,1772000,uh uh sir uh now uh we have uh we are  coming to the intermediate course uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,1772000,1777120,intermediate section  uh so our chairman said uh i'm just two
ca4ImOJjBJI,1777120,1784320,questions i'm posing to you  sir which is about uh like  why is the number of papers reduced from
ca4ImOJjBJI,1784320,1790640,eight to six  secondly  what about students of existing course
ca4ImOJjBJI,1790640,1795919,who have to give eight papers in  intermediate how would equity be ensured
ca4ImOJjBJI,1795919,1799039,to such students
ca4ImOJjBJI,1801919,1807600,so first of all  to all  our dear students and members and even
ca4ImOJjBJI,1807600,1813679,all the stakeholders  let me just put it one thing  ici
ca4ImOJjBJI,1813679,1819440,will never ensure  that our course get diluted
ca4ImOJjBJI,1819440,1825039,so let me just put it very clear it does  not matter  people are asking that question so i  appreciate but we all have been
ca4ImOJjBJI,1825039,1831679,deliberating there is not reduction in  the course papers yes correct that's  right that's very right
ca4ImOJjBJI,1831679,1837200,yeah so even in the case of uh  ministry when we were having a  presentation done friends we
ca4ImOJjBJI,1837200,1843360,specifically told it is not  reduction in the course it is basically  the way we are learning is going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,1843360,1849520,undergo change it is not that you know  the number of papers are going to come  down drastically example when you talk
ca4ImOJjBJI,1849520,1857600,about we had 4 in foundation 8 at inter  and 8 at final which is totaling to 20
ca4ImOJjBJI,1857600,1864880,my mathematics hopefully is right  right  so now it's going  correct
ca4ImOJjBJI,1865919,1873360,if my mathematics is right then  my vice chairman always talks about the  mathematical numbers which is very right
ca4ImOJjBJI,1873360,1880399,and the justification which we give he  gives with the statistical data is  something which is you know
ca4ImOJjBJI,1880399,1886240,worth  appreciable so similarly when you talk  about formulation or intermediate and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1886240,1891679,final in foundation there is no change  we actually discussed in the case of  intermediate
ca4ImOJjBJI,1891679,1899279,we are actually talking about a  situation where  uh  for six papers are going to be there
ca4ImOJjBJI,1899279,1905519,right  six paper at final four it this thing so  that four shortage which people are
ca4ImOJjBJI,1905519,1912320,thinking is not a four shortage this is  actually moved  from core subject to non-core subject
ca4ImOJjBJI,1912320,1920320,qualitative learning continues so this  is moved to  primarily self-paced learning module
ca4ImOJjBJI,1920320,1925519,that means they might not be required  for me immediately to remember reproduce
ca4ImOJjBJI,1925519,1933200,in examination where i am not able to  qualitatively understand the subject nor  am able to you know get anything great
ca4ImOJjBJI,1933200,1940080,out of it when you talk about corporate  law corporate law place other laws but  actually they are in combination 60 40
ca4ImOJjBJI,1940080,1945840,ratio so now just focus on corporate law  1600 marks and the other laws will be
ca4ImOJjBJI,1945840,1950960,moved to self-paced level so technically  we have not reduced any syllabus rather
ca4ImOJjBJI,1950960,1957600,we are giving an experiential learning  in the process you select which one  won't you you want to you know read and
ca4ImOJjBJI,1957600,1965440,understand and do your assessment test  online so that you understand the  subject effectively at that level right
ca4ImOJjBJI,1965440,1972720,so basic understanding will be there we  have all these subjects which are there  at a post qualification level in form of
ca4ImOJjBJI,1972720,1978080,certification courses so let that person  become an expert in this areas post
ca4ImOJjBJI,1978080,1984480,qualifying so at the beginning itself we  want to give an experience and  experiential learning and that number of
ca4ImOJjBJI,1984480,1990240,people are not reduced they continue to  be there because six and 6 on the both
ca4ImOJjBJI,1990240,1995760,side inter and final and 4 which is  there in self-paced learning module will
ca4ImOJjBJI,1995760,2001840,actually equal the entire process but  only thing is the burden of learning  will reduce
ca4ImOJjBJI,2001840,2007519,learning will be enjoyable that's the  only point which we want to put forward
ca4ImOJjBJI,2007519,2014960,the second question was with regards to  the  people who are actually going through  the eight papers right madam
ca4ImOJjBJI,2014960,2023039,they qualified eight papers and now they  are going to uh the new students are  going to write six six pages
ca4ImOJjBJI,2023200,2029760,i have already answered that it is not  going to be different either you have to  write examination in the old course
ca4ImOJjBJI,2029760,2035919,or might be take self-paced learning in  the new course as simple as that
ca4ImOJjBJI,2035919,2042159,answer uh also uh sir i also would like  to add over here  when the transition scheme will be
ca4ImOJjBJI,2042159,2048398,developed  uh all these things will be kept in mind  as to how to maintain parity for all
ca4ImOJjBJI,2048398,2055200,students  so i think that is what we all will be  working on itself council is very  conscious of the fact
ca4ImOJjBJI,2055200,2061839,yes and one more thing madam very  quickly  uh i think that is where level of  involvement of all of our council
ca4ImOJjBJI,2061839,2067280,members mr gan mishra has joined us from  london now he's actually gone for his uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2067280,2072638,uh seminar there  but i think he's actually been part of  this
ca4ImOJjBJI,2072638,2079919,uh  forum also at this point in time  whenever he switches on his video we'll  take his comment also for a moment okay
ca4ImOJjBJI,2079919,2086638,fine fine ah thank you sir uh sir uh now  yes yes good afternoon sir good
ca4ImOJjBJI,2086638,2093358,afternoon sir welcome how are you  fine sir welcome sir uh sir um

ca4ImOJjBJI,2100160,2107200,part of the outreach program sir along  with chairman sir and white chairman and  other council members so what has been
ca4ImOJjBJI,2107200,2113440,your experience if you can share it  certain few uh sentences
ca4ImOJjBJI,2113440,2118880,so thank you madam  at the outset i am really feeling
ca4ImOJjBJI,2118880,2124880,privileged that i got this opportunity  to interact about the new course  curriculum
ca4ImOJjBJI,2124880,2131040,at length  with the students and members  at large in circ
ca4ImOJjBJI,2131040,2136320,at the outset  i compliment  the credit committee chairman
ca4ImOJjBJI,2136320,2142640,dhaba and the vice chairman vishal  and of course  my dynamic secretary
ca4ImOJjBJI,2142640,2148160,bandana  for such a wonderful initiative  the course
ca4ImOJjBJI,2148160,2154079,as  reach out has been  done so far  i am not
ca4ImOJjBJI,2154079,2159760,exactly the numbers but i am quite sure  that this is historic so far banana
ca4ImOJjBJI,2159760,2166160,madam will witness it  this has been yes this has been a really  wonderful
ca4ImOJjBJI,2166160,2173760,outreach program  the transparency  the dedication  and of course the vision
ca4ImOJjBJI,2173760,2179920,of ici is certainly going to  meet out by this
ca4ImOJjBJI,2179920,2186640,exercise  and the one more thing i would like to  say
ca4ImOJjBJI,2186640,2192160,we are  heading global now  and course curriculum that has been
ca4ImOJjBJI,2192160,2198320,designed and that has been  underway  is certainly going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,2198320,2205119,take the ici at next level  i once again compliment each
ca4ImOJjBJI,2205119,2212240,committee members  under dynamic leadership of  their newest sharmaji and shibu shah
ca4ImOJjBJI,2212240,2217920,rusiji  i am sure  that this  new curriculum
ca4ImOJjBJI,2217920,2226160,will take  the students to new arena new dimension  and of course to ici next table so this
ca4ImOJjBJI,2226160,2233760,is all madam i wanted to share with you  thank you thank you sir thank you sir  thank you so much
ca4ImOJjBJI,2238880,2246000,yes  but kindly make it very quick  because we are having many questions
ca4ImOJjBJI,2246000,2252320,please please you never saw i want to  let you know today uh from six to eight  pm we are doing a
ca4ImOJjBJI,2252320,2258800,very big outreach program at delhi so  more than 300 participants will be there  and mainly we have invited all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2258800,2264880,students and members there  and that is a very beautiful design  program and apart from
ca4ImOJjBJI,2264880,2271440,physical programs we'll do the virtual  also and apart from that all our 24  branches are conducted program on this
ca4ImOJjBJI,2271440,2277920,crack majority of the branches have  already conducted the program on this  side  this is i want to inform you on that
ca4ImOJjBJI,2277920,2284320,excellent sir excellent thank you so  much  thank you very much thank you thank you
ca4ImOJjBJI,2284320,2289760,very much yes  um  uh i think sir now i'll go to the next  question
ca4ImOJjBJI,2289760,2297040,uh sir i am answer this question i'm  posing it to uh vice chairman sir  uh again sir uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2297040,2303839,these are about the subjects only  sir i'll be merging uh the three uh  subjects part over here
ca4ImOJjBJI,2303839,2309599,first is  initially we were  in the present scheme we are having two
ca4ImOJjBJI,2309599,2314880,papers of accounts now we are having  only one paper in the proposed key
ca4ImOJjBJI,2314880,2320800,enterprise information system we have  removed  presently it is there
ca4ImOJjBJI,2320800,2325839,and third is  company law  we have removed the allied loss from
ca4ImOJjBJI,2325839,2331280,here  so uh sir what do you uh what would you  like to just tell to all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2331280,2340400,stakeholders about it  because  yeah  so for taking the questions one by one
ca4ImOJjBJI,2353119,2359280,one at the intermediate level they are  being moved to the foundation level they  have been shifted to the foundation
ca4ImOJjBJI,2359280,2364800,level  second is also there are certain  industry specific topics uh in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2364800,2371359,present intermediate uh papers which are  proposed to be removed from the syllabus  because they are too specific to a
ca4ImOJjBJI,2371359,2376880,particular industry and  may not be of utility in general so that
ca4ImOJjBJI,2376880,2383760,would overall reduce the number of  topics that were being covered  at the intermediate level and therefore
ca4ImOJjBJI,2383760,2388880,the two papers are proposed to be merged  into one paper without making the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2388880,2394000,syllabus too bulky  so it would be equal some portion would  be moved to the foundation some would be
ca4ImOJjBJI,2394000,2399440,dropped and what could be remain would  merge into a single paper that is paper  one of advanced accounting in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2399440,2404480,proportion so it's not that 200 marks  would become 100 mark but it would be
ca4ImOJjBJI,2404480,2411319,over a balanced approach that would be  there as far as every single paper is  concerned
ca4ImOJjBJI,2414560,2421680,uh what is the thought process is that  information technology education which  is very very important in the current
ca4ImOJjBJI,2421680,2428960,scenario it would be imported in an  integrated manner along with all the  core subjects at the final level so from
ca4ImOJjBJI,2428960,2435280,intermediate level eis is being removed  and what has been proposed  is that the information technology would
ca4ImOJjBJI,2435280,2440640,be integrated into all the core subjects  at the final level so that the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,2440640,2446160,are able to learn as well as apply  information technology in each of the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2446160,2451280,core area uh the direct tags read the  indirect tags with financial reporting
ca4ImOJjBJI,2451280,2458480,targeting whatever are the technology  related aspects to each of these papers  would be covered in the respective paper
ca4ImOJjBJI,2458480,2465359,they will be integrated into that paper  and that is why we was thought that eis  can be removed from the proposed
ca4ImOJjBJI,2465359,2471760,intermediate curriculum  that is what was there on the eis coming
ca4ImOJjBJI,2471760,2478640,to the company law  company of friends presently what we are  having  some sections are there at the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2478640,2485040,intermediate level and the balance of  the company law is at the final level  uh during the course of our interactions
ca4ImOJjBJI,2485040,2490400,and  suggestions that we were we had received  earlier also was that students were
ca4ImOJjBJI,2490400,2497839,finding it difficult to connect while  they are doing the practical training  because a large uh time of the practical
ca4ImOJjBJI,2497839,2504079,training the application or knowledge of  companies with companies act or the  company law is very very important be on
ca4ImOJjBJI,2504079,2510480,the audit side or do it on the financial  statement side accounting side knowledge  of company law becomes extremely
ca4ImOJjBJI,2510480,2515839,important so what is now being proposed  is that the entire company law would be
ca4ImOJjBJI,2515839,2522560,covered at the intermediate level so  this would have helped the student uh in  their practical training also because
ca4ImOJjBJI,2522560,2527920,now the practical training is proposed  to be uh starting after passing both the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2527920,2535119,groups of the intermediate exam that is  which will mean that the student is well  equipped with the whole company's act
ca4ImOJjBJI,2535119,2541040,before he or she starts the article  should training the practical training  and therefore the application of that
ca4ImOJjBJI,2541040,2548480,would be much easier and very useful for  these students going forward so that is  why the company's act is now being
ca4ImOJjBJI,2548480,2554160,concentrated in one paper and the  intermediate level  that is the response from my side ma'am
ca4ImOJjBJI,2554160,2559680,on the three subject specifically  thank you sir sir one very quick
ca4ImOJjBJI,2559680,2568880,question to you only sir  uh why is there a single paper for  direct and indirect tax at this level
ca4ImOJjBJI,2570240,2576400,so  if we see over all the same decades our  whole curriculum is that foundation or
ca4ImOJjBJI,2576400,2583119,entrance is the basic knowledge  the intermediate is a working knowledge  and final is the expert knowledge uh i
ca4ImOJjBJI,2583119,2590480,remember when i was studying even in the  curriculum  that was that used to be written as the  heading and the reach of the subject
ca4ImOJjBJI,2590480,2595839,uh so what what is now being proposed or  we already had that the taxation uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2595839,2600960,where they had uh direct and indirect  tax both uh combined into a single paper
ca4ImOJjBJI,2600960,2606319,of taxation at the intermediate level so  this is predominantly keeping in mind
ca4ImOJjBJI,2606319,2612319,the level of knowledge which can be  expected from a student who is yet to  come off the practical training so that
ca4ImOJjBJI,2612319,2617839,is true for the direct times that is  income tax as well as the gst also and
ca4ImOJjBJI,2617839,2622960,that is the why there is a single paper  for both the taxes at intermediate level
ca4ImOJjBJI,2622960,2629440,at final level if we see  that when the student has completed the  practical training advanced knowledge is
ca4ImOJjBJI,2629440,2636240,expected and therefore at final level  considering the vastness of the syllabus  at the direct tags and the indirect tax
ca4ImOJjBJI,2636240,2641920,level these are two separate papers that  are there at the final level so that is  why at the intermediate there is a
ca4ImOJjBJI,2641920,2648560,common paper and at the final they are  boosted  thank you sir for your uh clarification
ca4ImOJjBJI,2648560,2655359,sir i hope the the doubts which are  there in the mind of the stakeholders i  think would would have been put to rest
ca4ImOJjBJI,2655359,2661520,now sir  uh uh so the next questions are uh to  the chairman sir sir i'm asking two
ca4ImOJjBJI,2661520,2669440,questions to you sir  uh  why is now case scenario based questions  introduced in all the papers like in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2669440,2677119,proposed in the current scheme it is  only for the theoretical papers white  has been extended to all the papers
ca4ImOJjBJI,2677119,2682720,and why have we now introduced sir  negative marking
ca4ImOJjBJI,2683119,2689300,thank you very much  again but i just exchanged one more  point of vishal by's question i'll just
ca4ImOJjBJI,2689300,2692409,[Music]
ca4ImOJjBJI,2698800,2704000,there are debates which have come that  you know final uh intermediate also
ca4ImOJjBJI,2704000,2709440,income tax and gst has to be separate  but just imagine the number of subjects
ca4ImOJjBJI,2709440,2716160,which we all our chartered accountants  are doing is not matchable  one side we say the syllabus is bulky
ca4ImOJjBJI,2716160,2721520,one side we say that we want to  introduce experiential learning so there  is a balance that needs to be done and
ca4ImOJjBJI,2721520,2727839,very tightly instead by vishal on the  income tax and gst part i want only a  learning experience they should be in
ca4ImOJjBJI,2727839,2734000,position to execute  so considering this factor  that is one part of the learning
ca4ImOJjBJI,2734000,2739520,experience now second part of the  learning experience is why case  scenarios have been introduced in all
ca4ImOJjBJI,2739520,2747119,the subjects now case scenarios are  introduced in all the subjects only and  only for one reason that rather than
ca4ImOJjBJI,2747119,2753040,remembering the subject it is  application of the subject also is  required to be tested in the process
ca4ImOJjBJI,2753040,2758640,when you talk about application of a  subject need to be tested in the  processes case scenarios are the best
ca4ImOJjBJI,2758640,2764079,example to take up that kind of  situation or solutions which we want to
ca4ImOJjBJI,2764079,2770400,give the students get into analytical  thinking and the discharge of knowledge
ca4ImOJjBJI,2770400,2775920,happens qualitatively now this is one  part what is happening i and we are not
ca4ImOJjBJI,2775920,2781119,reducing the syllabus we are focusing on  the syllabus like example corporate law
ca4ImOJjBJI,2781119,2786240,income tax gst we are focusing on the  subject  and then we are creating case theory
ca4ImOJjBJI,2786240,2793920,means analytical skill now why negative  marking is only and only for simple  reason that students should not get into
ca4ImOJjBJI,2793920,2800560,a guesswork answering  do you want a high quality chart  accountant to get into the stream
ca4ImOJjBJI,2800560,2807520,application has to be effective  analytical skills have to be good so  that when they face the market and when
ca4ImOJjBJI,2807520,2812880,we are talking about introducing concept  of baa where we are going to issue a  certificate where we are taking the
ca4ImOJjBJI,2812880,2820160,feedback of the people the person should  be standing with a good amount of  caliber before the society is something
ca4ImOJjBJI,2820160,2825440,which we are looking at so that  experiential learning can be there for  them that's it nothing more than this
ca4ImOJjBJI,2825440,2832640,thank you  thank you so one more question for you  sir sir as of now uh revalidation there
ca4ImOJjBJI,2832640,2838240,is no uh limit  at the intermediate level rather at any  of the levels
ca4ImOJjBJI,2838240,2843440,why now revalidation is now permitted at  the intermediate level
ca4ImOJjBJI,2843440,2850318,only once  after five years only once they can  revalidate it again
ca4ImOJjBJI,2850960,2859839,now now we shall buy with your  permission  board of studies  director should answer this question
ca4ImOJjBJI,2859839,2865839,why do you think we have done it and you  know the answer very well  so what do you mean
ca4ImOJjBJI,2865839,2871040,that is very true  sir the answers are very much there in  my mind but
ca4ImOJjBJI,2871040,2876880,since both of you were there i was  wanting both of you to rather address  rather than me sir
ca4ImOJjBJI,2876880,2882319,but sir uh i will be answering to this  question uh i think uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2882319,2889520,i'll be addressing it to the students  students you know that uh  ten years are quite sufficient i think
ca4ImOJjBJI,2889520,2895200,we are giving you enough time  rather uh to finish your intermediate we
ca4ImOJjBJI,2895200,2900480,do not want that you are  if you are not able to clear by any  chance
ca4ImOJjBJI,2900480,2906960,you are having any problems  we do not want that you should keep on  doing it and then you should not feel
ca4ImOJjBJI,2906960,2912319,frustrated at the end of the day so  that's why we have kept this limitation
ca4ImOJjBJI,2912319,2918400,and this has been also deliberated well  that  uh i think 10-year period is quite a
ca4ImOJjBJI,2918400,2924079,sufficient time for the students to pass  the intermediate that's the reason uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2924079,2930880,this restriction has been brought in now  but this restriction is not for the  final level for final there is no
ca4ImOJjBJI,2930880,2938960,restriction  you can do it as many times as possible  that uh permission is there at that time
ca4ImOJjBJI,2938960,2946400,right sir uh sir uh next uh one last no  one wants to do as many times
ca4ImOJjBJI,2946720,2952960,a person has to clear so inter is  something where we want to motivate  those people and ensure that shortest
ca4ImOJjBJI,2952960,2960079,time you clear examination otherwise we  are sitting with huge amount of  unsuccessful stories and our intent is
ca4ImOJjBJI,2960079,2966240,just to ensure that you know people get  motivated when you see a barrier when  you see a finishing line automatically a
ca4ImOJjBJI,2966240,2971599,student works towards that yes the  circumstances at the initial stage will  be different at a later point it will be
ca4ImOJjBJI,2971599,2975920,different this will give an  encouragement to the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,2978000,2983680,but students uh kindly just  just understand we want you to clear at
ca4ImOJjBJI,2983680,2988880,the earliest but this is the upper limit  we have kept that is it uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,2988880,2994880,sir uh this another question is  about the direct entry scheme  uh like
ca4ImOJjBJI,2994880,3002400,they're saying why in the case of direct  entry why are students required to  undergo a study period of eight months
ca4ImOJjBJI,3002400,3009440,instead of as of now they can sit for  the exams  intermediate exams after nine months of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3009440,3013078,practical training
ca4ImOJjBJI,3026960,3032640,yeah i missed hearing the question also  i'm sorry so you can  can do it
ca4ImOJjBJI,3032640,3039359,uh actually uh what has really happened  now what we have done is in the proposed  scheme we have uh the council is
ca4ImOJjBJI,3039359,3045920,recommended that students start their  practical training after they finish  both the group after they pass both the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3045920,3051040,groups of intermediate  so  through direct entry
ca4ImOJjBJI,3051040,3056160,so both the students from the foundation  route or direct entry route once they
ca4ImOJjBJI,3056160,3062559,clear both their groups of intermediate  then only they can commence the  practical training so that is why we
ca4ImOJjBJI,3062559,3068960,have now changed the criteria  for uh the direct country students also
ca4ImOJjBJI,3068960,3074000,and we have made it it's a parity with  now foundation root students and for
ca4ImOJjBJI,3074000,3079920,direct entry students that's the reason  we have now come out uh with eight month
ca4ImOJjBJI,3079920,3087359,study period because  commencement of practical training will  be only after passing both the groups of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3087359,3093440,intermediate that is the reason this  particular change has been brought in
ca4ImOJjBJI,3093440,3100480,uh i think sir now we'll come to the uh  practical training related questions
ca4ImOJjBJI,3100559,3107760,so like uh now what i have ended is that  after passing both the groups of  intermediate the question is why
ca4ImOJjBJI,3107760,3114079,practical training should start only  after qualifying both groups of  intermediate
ca4ImOJjBJI,3114079,3120960,why can't the existing system of  alloying practical training  after qualifying either of the groups
ca4ImOJjBJI,3120960,3124960,continue  so
ca4ImOJjBJI,3131760,3137680,sometime people are thinking it is a  little longer than sorry once again this  is little longer period to complete the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3137680,3143359,ca course so what we thought is the  other alternative was we reduce the  intermediate uh you know the articles
ca4ImOJjBJI,3143359,3151200,feeling up to uh two years where they  can dedicatedly put their time and focus  without it should be an example
ca4ImOJjBJI,3151200,3157760,right it should be an example  so what we thought is if it has to be  exam free period what is happening today
ca4ImOJjBJI,3157760,3163280,one group see this is a second school of  thought you all have an uh opportunity
ca4ImOJjBJI,3163280,3169119,to say that okay this school of thought  might not be right might be good  whatever it is as as the number of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3169119,3175599,papers from eight has become six which  have to be written in the examination  point number one and portion is gone
ca4ImOJjBJI,3175599,3181520,supported portion has been actually  you know trimmed to a level where it is  moved to self-paced learning which needs
ca4ImOJjBJI,3181520,3188000,to be done during your articleship  period so the focus can be good and  qualitative when you have to write six
ca4ImOJjBJI,3188000,3193839,papers so the six papers when you write  at that point in time you are actually
ca4ImOJjBJI,3193839,3201359,getting the knowledge with you and we  are also in thinking process because  when 30 of the questions in all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3201359,3207440,subjects are going to be case scenario  based so this case scenarios can be  created and kept ready with us that
ca4ImOJjBJI,3207440,3213440,means 70 of the paper need to be set  every time and there may be a  probability which we are proposing that
ca4ImOJjBJI,3213440,3218720,the intermediate examination should be  which is conducted twice in a year
ca4ImOJjBJI,3218720,3224000,which is conducted twice in a year is  now also been proposed to have thrice of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3224000,3231119,four times in a year considering all  these factors we have been thinking that  why not we put this two years practical
ca4ImOJjBJI,3231119,3237440,training which is exam free so that the  learning experience can be very  qualitative number two completing both
ca4ImOJjBJI,3237440,3244720,groups and coming will actually give  motivation to the student also that yes  he's completed one section of his uh you
ca4ImOJjBJI,3244720,3251599,know passing  and then the quality which has been  given to a member in practice or member
ca4ImOJjBJI,3251599,3258640,in industry for industrial training is  actually there when they complete that  section of learning so that is the whole
ca4ImOJjBJI,3258640,3265920,thought process you are at a liberty to  share your thoughts and views if it is  different thank you
ca4ImOJjBJI,3265920,3272880,thank you sir  uh sir now come to vice chairman sir  uh uh sir uh it's again about the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3272880,3279680,practical training so students are  saying that we have reduced now the  period from three years to two years
ca4ImOJjBJI,3279680,3285760,we have made it uninterrupted  there is doubt in the mind of the  students that
ca4ImOJjBJI,3285760,3292400,this is not an uninterrupted period  because students have to do a self-paced  learning also they have to do
ca4ImOJjBJI,3292400,3298720,plus they have to do the i.t and soft  skill training also  so they are saying that it should be
ca4ImOJjBJI,3298720,3304240,it is a  rather uh this period like we are saying  is not
ca4ImOJjBJI,3304240,3309760,uninterrupted period so for your  clarification
ca4ImOJjBJI,3310640,3318319,yeah  uh i agree this is a question which i  have also  seen at a lot of the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3318319,3324640,outreach meetings where i was involved  and uh uh i would like to clarify over  here
ca4ImOJjBJI,3324640,3330720,first of all the third year season  exactly bigger than the top of the main  november exams where there is a lot of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3330720,3336000,pressure that is the  content of subjects actually done at the  same time
ca4ImOJjBJI,3336000,3341040,uh when it comes to the self-paced  online model  see other names suggest they are
ca4ImOJjBJI,3341040,3347359,self-based you know that means the  student  can prepare for it as at least a own
ca4ImOJjBJI,3347359,3354400,convenience comfort  and it's not necessarily certain that  there is a particular shipment
ca4ImOJjBJI,3354400,3359680,and if i do a very simple mathematics  like the chairman's there mentions that
ca4ImOJjBJI,3359680,3365040,numbers is something which i get  attached to uh  if i look at it
ca4ImOJjBJI,3365040,3371599,there is a period of two and a half  years from intermediate to the final so  i passed into groups of the intermediate
ca4ImOJjBJI,3371599,3377119,and then two years article shift after  completion of articles
ca4ImOJjBJI,3379359,3386319,now i am not incurring with the six  months because i believe that is  exclusively a school figure that is  there for the student to prepare for the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3386319,3391680,finance keeping that aside the students  still have two years to complete four
ca4ImOJjBJI,3391680,3398640,self-placed online modules which gives  an average of six months as a very  simple arithmetic six months for one
ca4ImOJjBJI,3398640,3405119,paper that the student has to complete  and that also on a certain case basis
ca4ImOJjBJI,3415280,3419160,but at the same time
ca4ImOJjBJI,3423040,3430000,appearing for them and passing them  again like i said there is no sequence  uh in which the papers have to be given
ca4ImOJjBJI,3430000,3435200,there is no time limit also that once  you  start a paper you have six months only
ca4ImOJjBJI,3435200,3441520,or four months you need to complete the  student may prefer that for one full  year he or she wants to study all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3441520,3447839,four papers and after that wants to  appear for the workforce also
ca4ImOJjBJI,3473040,3479359,mode uh the virtual world  can be completed within the ten years of  the practical training and physical mode
ca4ImOJjBJI,3479359,3484880,can be taken after sunday's whatever  you know whichever way the scheme comes
ca4ImOJjBJI,3484880,3490960,out so again that is not mandatory to be  done in the first two years or during  the practical training it can be done
ca4ImOJjBJI,3490960,3497920,even after that in the six months of the  study period the student has at the same  time many times we've seen uh especially
ca4ImOJjBJI,3497920,3503440,in the city offices that there are  certain  years i would say week 10 days two weeks
ca4ImOJjBJI,3503440,3510480,that there are many periods as far as  work is concerned many times we've seen  that and if the student is able to do
ca4ImOJjBJI,3510480,3516079,the i.t and the soft skills training  period of a fortnight so then it would
ca4ImOJjBJI,3516079,3522319,help or the student uh or utilize the  time also and as well as complete the ip  and the software so that is total
ca4ImOJjBJI,3522319,3527680,flexibility that is built in this system  and i  believe that it is not something that
ca4ImOJjBJI,3527680,3533520,would impact the practical training but  on the company who help the student in  peace
ca4ImOJjBJI,3533520,3539920,his or her studies along with practical  training in a much more efficient way
ca4ImOJjBJI,3540240,3547839,i think that is what we might as well  yes thank you so would you like to add  anything sir sir would you like to add
ca4ImOJjBJI,3547839,3553200,anything sir from yourself  i think is covered completely in total
ca4ImOJjBJI,3553200,3560559,uh to sense the purpose of this  and uh one point which is there
ca4ImOJjBJI,3560559,3568000,when we want to make it experiential  again i'm using the word experiential is  only because people have to understand
ca4ImOJjBJI,3568000,3575200,the concept of rote learning is  something which has been discussed at  length not in institute at length
ca4ImOJjBJI,3575200,3581599,including the national education policy  including in uh it has been discussed at  length in the international
ca4ImOJjBJI,3581599,3587599,education standards  so what is rot learning is primarily  whether i understand or not
ca4ImOJjBJI,3587599,3593760,or do you reproduce when my examination  are there when i understand i or whether  i understand i don't understand
ca4ImOJjBJI,3593760,3600640,now in this particular case what is  going to happen is the core papers will  be focused learning papers right and the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3600640,3607440,non-core papers which we are talking  about in four sets are going to be more  of a basic knowledge in that basic
ca4ImOJjBJI,3607440,3612960,knowledge we are not going to touch  test them on the advanced level of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3612960,3618880,you know learning it's going to be the  basic so you watch the video listen the  video do the entire process whenever
ca4ImOJjBJI,3618880,3625920,trust me train me  a flight  wherever you are sitting where you are  sitting idle when there is no peak hours
ca4ImOJjBJI,3625920,3631119,of your article shift period when the  income tax gst or you know company law
ca4ImOJjBJI,3631119,3638480,deadlines are not there so during that  time when it is available just learn  listen to the lectures twice twice one
ca4ImOJjBJI,3638480,3643920,time whatever it is experience here and  then you go and attempt your examination  so it is not going to trouble you with
ca4ImOJjBJI,3643920,3652240,your  training practically as such  so that's the only thing and it's online  any any time anyway
ca4ImOJjBJI,3653839,3659280,now sir  uh i think that this is the question uh  this is some these are the doubts from
ca4ImOJjBJI,3659280,3665680,the student side  said now they're saying why is the  requirement to undergo one year post
ca4ImOJjBJI,3665680,3672480,qualification experience with ca firm  for obtaining cop  why we are introducing one additional
ca4ImOJjBJI,3672480,3678799,layer for students for other for members  who are going to opt for cop
ca4ImOJjBJI,3681200,3684599,so i think
ca4ImOJjBJI,3687440,3693599,no no i think uh people have been  speculating on this particular question  a lot
ca4ImOJjBJI,3693599,3698880,uh i don't know why people are still in  a frame of mind that you know
ca4ImOJjBJI,3698880,3705839,we are going to work under fca i have  worked in an industry for might be fun  more than 15 years why should i go
ca4ImOJjBJI,3705839,3711599,you know there are two three aspects to  this  uh for a fresh year who's qualified
ca4ImOJjBJI,3711599,3719359,we have reduced the number of years so  that means two years he is focusing on  learning  one side now the third year used to be
ca4ImOJjBJI,3719359,3726640,generally for a third year article also  he used to be in charge of an engagement  in a smaller engagement even vishal bay
ca4ImOJjBJI,3726640,3731680,in his office my office we have given  that experience the free hand to deliver
ca4ImOJjBJI,3731680,3736880,and lead a team so that portion which is  there we are actually getting it back in
ca4ImOJjBJI,3736880,3742160,form of  an experiential learning with a  chartered accountant whether his own
ca4ImOJjBJI,3742160,3747760,firm where he worked his articles or of  new firm he can go and work with when he
ca4ImOJjBJI,3747760,3754400,heard he might have got a new idea or a  new thought process  a person this is for the fresh air for
ca4ImOJjBJI,3754400,3761440,an industry member who is coming today  and actually working in a chartered  accounting firm rather than creating a
ca4ImOJjBJI,3761440,3767920,proprietary concern michelle you will  agree correct  75 percent of the firms today have
ca4ImOJjBJI,3767920,3775839,actually been appropriately concerned in  a country like india  we have 29 states in 29 state average if
ca4ImOJjBJI,3775839,3781280,we take out more than 30 partner firm  itself is not there now third side we
ca4ImOJjBJI,3781280,3786400,are talking about making big firms  whereas some people are moving towards  smaller firms
ca4ImOJjBJI,3786400,3793200,when this kind of opportunity whether a  new qualified chartered accountant a  person who is coming from industry after
ca4ImOJjBJI,3793200,3800079,completing it is not that he has to work  under a chartered account rather why not  we think about an atmosphere has been
ca4ImOJjBJI,3800079,3805760,created to work together align together  and ensure that rather than creating a
ca4ImOJjBJI,3805760,3812559,mushroom form again as a proprietary  concern can't i go and be associated  with the firm where your experience
ca4ImOJjBJI,3812559,3819599,can be well recognized so this is the  third part of it now the fourth part of  it is when you talk about a practice and
ca4ImOJjBJI,3819599,3825280,an industry the difference is there  undoubtedly the difference is not to  discriminate
ca4ImOJjBJI,3825280,3832559,please understand members and students  we are not trying to discriminate we are  not an authority to discriminate and we
ca4ImOJjBJI,3832559,3839200,will never do a discrimination between a  member in industry and member in  practice the point which is there today
ca4ImOJjBJI,3839200,3844960,is that the kind of uh you know laws and  regulations which are coming right a
ca4ImOJjBJI,3844960,3850400,person is required to understand that  effectiveness now what is happening
ca4ImOJjBJI,3850400,3855760,whether it is engagement letter  management representation letter this  letter that letter when certain other
ca4ImOJjBJI,3855760,3861839,kind of inquiries come up at that point  in time some people  are on the fundamental side when you
ca4ImOJjBJI,3861839,3867920,talk about you know  getting in the fundamentals and getting  the  things right
ca4ImOJjBJI,3867920,3874240,might be why not we think in the line  that a young person has started his  practice a senior plumber coming and
ca4ImOJjBJI,3874240,3880720,getting associated as a paid employee it  is not an articleship period let me be  very clear it is a paid association
ca4ImOJjBJI,3880720,3887039,which is there so paid association means  that person who has worked with a  particular person if he feels good to
ca4ImOJjBJI,3887039,3893920,continue that person can become partner  in the firm and that one year is not  going to go west the association with
ca4ImOJjBJI,3893920,3899920,that firm also will continue so there is  an advantage which is coming out of it  why are we continuously thinking and
ca4ImOJjBJI,3899920,3905599,deliberating that you know why a senior  person is going to come and work under a  junior person no that is not an
ca4ImOJjBJI,3905599,3912640,intention we are not trying to create a  discrimination we are trying to create  an atmosphere where we actually
ca4ImOJjBJI,3912640,3918720,synergize our entire energies together  and ensure that at one point in time the
ca4ImOJjBJI,3918720,3924319,firms become larger  please don't take it in a format of
ca4ImOJjBJI,3924319,3930240,going in a junior level senior level  industry person separate practice level  separate no
ca4ImOJjBJI,3930240,3937920,if you have an authority we have thought  in a different perspective that you know  a person can come be part of an firm and
ca4ImOJjBJI,3937920,3945119,then he can be part of a firm in a  capacity of a partner we want to create  a nice atmosphere rather than creating
ca4ImOJjBJI,3945119,3951200,that 75 percent becoming 85 percent and  tomorrow we don't have a large firm in
ca4ImOJjBJI,3951200,3957680,india is not a message which we are  going to give to the nation rather it is  to be taken in a manner that we are
ca4ImOJjBJI,3957680,3963200,going to create an atmosphere of synergy  benefit to work on so many there are a
ca4ImOJjBJI,3963200,3969520,lot of speculations which people are  having everyone has their own thought we  have come out with a positive thought
ca4ImOJjBJI,3969520,3974799,from the institute which we are  presenting to the nation we are  presenting to the fraternity presenting
ca4ImOJjBJI,3974799,3980799,to the new chartered accountants  presenting to those experiences
ca4ImOJjBJI,3980799,3987920,been there in industry to come  collaborate or work together and move  forward that is our intention not to
ca4ImOJjBJI,3987920,3993039,create a line of difference in thought  process that's the only thing thank you  very
ca4ImOJjBJI,4005119,4011520,uh uh so uh now we are on to the  self-paced modules uh uh i am opposing
ca4ImOJjBJI,4011520,4016960,so this question to vice chairman sir  sir uh these are two uh contradictory
ca4ImOJjBJI,4016960,4022160,set of doubts  which the students are having in their  mindset
ca4ImOJjBJI,4022160,4028079,one is why are self-paced online modules  being introduced considering that it
ca4ImOJjBJI,4028079,4035680,will increase the burden on the students  and second set of the  question is would self-based online
ca4ImOJjBJI,4035680,4042400,modules be effective  since the students may not take it  seriously
ca4ImOJjBJI,4047680,4053599,i i i agree with what the chairman said  that there's a lot of stagnation that is  there
ca4ImOJjBJI,4053599,4060720,and uh this question itself says that  you know there are bulls and bears both  in the market
ca4ImOJjBJI,4061039,4068480,but let me tell you that  the syllabus is neither for the bulls  not for the bears
ca4ImOJjBJI,4068559,4076640,so you know i would like to answer uh  the question one is about uh having the  burden and second is about uh being uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,4076640,4081920,uh not so focused on the sales base  like the chevy mentioned earlier that
ca4ImOJjBJI,4081920,4086960,the whole one of the major objectives  was that without diluting the curriculum
ca4ImOJjBJI,4086960,4093920,how we can make it more effective you  know and that is why this one level was  increased uh at the between the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4093920,4099278,intermediate and the final level how i  would put at it so you know when we had
ca4ImOJjBJI,4099278,4104480,20 papers over three levels and now we  have 20 papers over four hours what does
ca4ImOJjBJI,4104480,4109758,that mean is that the student is able to  focus whichever level of exam he or she
ca4ImOJjBJI,4109758,4116960,is appearing in right with the  intermediate with the self-pace we've  designed  the student to get sufficient time to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4116960,4123359,focus on these studies that is  one  prepare properly
ca4ImOJjBJI,4123359,4129278,and definitely the most important aspect  is not to do road learning on those but
ca4ImOJjBJI,4129278,4134960,who  own the interpretational and analytical  skills to apply whatever they are
ca4ImOJjBJI,4134960,4141679,learning in a proper manner and they  have sufficient time for them so now  that's what has been spread i would also
ca4ImOJjBJI,4141679,4147040,say  the main november typical examination  is being uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,4147040,4152560,brought down by introducing one more  level that is a self-paced online module
ca4ImOJjBJI,4152560,4160599,and that gives sufficient time for  students to pass it normally otherwise  what we used to have
ca4ImOJjBJI,4167040,4172238,yeah sorry sorry for the disturbance so  uh what i was trying to say is that
ca4ImOJjBJI,4172238,4177440,imagine what we have today is that we  have a six months or eight months or  whatever and the student is studying for
ca4ImOJjBJI,4177440,4182960,eight people  at the intermediate level  examination level now
ca4ImOJjBJI,4182960,4189758,what we have is we have eight ones at  the intermediate level where a student  prepares for the six papers then we have
ca4ImOJjBJI,4189758,4195440,two years for a student to appear and  pass the self-paced modules and then we
ca4ImOJjBJI,4195440,4202159,have let us say six months especially  for a student to prepare for the final  level so they are the papers which are
ca4ImOJjBJI,4202159,4209280,being spread across the whole curriculum  second thing also that it also  brings in continuous learning so it's
ca4ImOJjBJI,4209280,4214960,not that intermediate you have passed  both groups you start your article shape  and then you wait for eight papers at
ca4ImOJjBJI,4214960,4220719,the final group and in between one and a  half two years there is a vacuum so what  is happening is that we are reducing
ca4ImOJjBJI,4220719,4227199,these uh papers from the respective exam  and filling up this vacuum that there is  a continuous studies that the student
ca4ImOJjBJI,4227199,4232560,undergoes while in the self-paced online  module so like i said it's neither so  it's
ca4ImOJjBJI,4232560,4238239,neither that that the student would be  burdened you know like i said earlier  also the student has sufficient time to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4238239,4245440,prepare appear and pass the online  models and one thing important that i  would like to share over here that for
ca4ImOJjBJI,4245440,4250480,all the papers especially the oswell  space online module the board of studies
ca4ImOJjBJI,4250480,4257920,is going to walk that extra mile in  giving the requisite study material the  audiobooks in ebooks
ca4ImOJjBJI,4257920,4262960,uh  lectures also for the students to  prepare uh for the various self-paced
ca4ImOJjBJI,4262960,4269840,online modules and which you know they  can do it like the chairman mentioned at  their own street time at their own speed
ca4ImOJjBJI,4269840,4276640,will and so this is what it is solving  for the sales page and so it would not  burden and at the same time it will not
ca4ImOJjBJI,4276640,4283760,be relaxed thing because  passing before self-paced online module  is one of the criteria for the student
ca4ImOJjBJI,4283760,4291120,to appear for the final examination so  ultimately the student cannot you know  just relax and say we take it you know
ca4ImOJjBJI,4291120,4297199,let's relax we have now only the final  exams to prepare for  if that would not happen because this is
ca4ImOJjBJI,4297199,4303679,one of the criteria a condition for the  student to be eligible for final  examination so i like i said it is this
ca4ImOJjBJI,4303679,4309840,is neither the bear neither bull uh it's  something that balances off between them  yeah i think chairman wants to add
ca4ImOJjBJI,4309840,4315120,something over to you  the only thing which you missed though
ca4ImOJjBJI,4315120,4321199,is finally they have to get 50  for passing the module also so that is  again very important and the best part
ca4ImOJjBJI,4321199,4327520,is the learning experience is going to  be very different because it is going to  be online learning number two
ca4ImOJjBJI,4327520,4334480,importantly online assessment test is  going to be there and this is all going  to be proctored number four is going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4334480,4342239,be whatever you are learning we want to  make it light but not zero please  understand it's primarily the quality of
ca4ImOJjBJI,4342239,4348960,the subject will not be lost when you  talk about a particular thing like in a  constitution of india we are going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4348960,4355280,get the best of the best speakers to  come and talk on that and create  atmosphere of learning in the process so
ca4ImOJjBJI,4355280,4360480,it's not going to be some of the people  have been talking again speculating  visual way that you know it is going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4360480,4367920,be an easy cakewalk so people please  understand it will be easy cakewalk if  you listen to it twice thrice and
ca4ImOJjBJI,4367920,4374640,understand the law because the  fundamentals will be tested so  fundamentals with mcq will be tested mcq
ca4ImOJjBJI,4374640,4380560,with negative marketing will be tested  and that 50  so that that being prepared so it's not
ca4ImOJjBJI,4380560,4385719,so  diluted thing is
ca4ImOJjBJI,4386480,4392880,it has been spread so the burden of  passing for a student is not there he  should enjoy learning that's the only
ca4ImOJjBJI,4392880,4399280,message  so very rightly said by both of you it's  uh there is going to be a change in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4399280,4406400,manner of learning  and as a chairman has been saying it's  going to be an experiential learning so
ca4ImOJjBJI,4406400,4413520,you will be uh and border studies is  working on that how to make your  learning very interesting
ca4ImOJjBJI,4413520,4420159,right uh so uh  again uh these are the two questions on  self-paced modules
ca4ImOJjBJI,4420159,4426960,because we are having lot of i think  stakeholders are having lot of uh doubts  in their minds as to how it is going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4426960,4432239,work and what is the relevance of them  so so the two questions are
ca4ImOJjBJI,4432239,4437520,one is are self-paced modules  set c and set d
ca4ImOJjBJI,4437520,4442640,necessary  and what is their relevance in the crca
ca4ImOJjBJI,4442640,4448080,curriculum  this is one part answer uh the second  part is
ca4ImOJjBJI,4448080,4455679,uh the stakeholders are having that  doubt in their mind they are actually  feeling  why have economic loss
ca4ImOJjBJI,4455679,4460960,and strategic costing and performance  evaluation shifted from the core papers
ca4ImOJjBJI,4460960,4469280,to the self-paced bodies  so these are the two questions on the  self-paced model subject specifics
ca4ImOJjBJI,4469280,4477120,so  the part one is with regards to uh  primarily set c and 7d
ca4ImOJjBJI,4477120,4484000,set c if a person makes a question that  what is the relevance of it it is  basically a specialization set c
ca4ImOJjBJI,4484000,4489120,specialization only and learning any one  whichever you want to specialize you can
ca4ImOJjBJI,4489120,4495679,do it now point number two  how many of in set d  we have constitution of india which has
ca4ImOJjBJI,4495679,4500960,been incorporated for the first time in  73 years  let us all put our hand and heart
ca4ImOJjBJI,4500960,4507280,together  and ask  whether how much we know about the  constitution of india point number one
ca4ImOJjBJI,4507280,4513040,point number two when you talk about  psychology and philosophy that being a  part that it is forming part of nap
ca4ImOJjBJI,4513040,4518159,requirement also but psychology and  philosophy today it is becoming more
ca4ImOJjBJI,4518159,4524800,relevant from the kind of frauds which  are actually coming out till the time  you don't understand the psychology of
ca4ImOJjBJI,4524800,4531840,philosophy of an organization and  psychology of a promoter it's very  difficult to put pen paper together so
ca4ImOJjBJI,4531840,4539280,the fundamental of philosophy and  psychology what is the way you need to  think and analyze not only the subject
ca4ImOJjBJI,4539280,4544800,but also the culture of an organization  a attitude of a person that need to be
ca4ImOJjBJI,4544800,4551040,understood very well so i think this is  a suggestion which is actually been  introduced by us now set c when people
ca4ImOJjBJI,4551040,4557840,are telling that is not required i am a  little shocked and why people are asking  me that forensic audit should be forming
ca4ImOJjBJI,4557840,4562880,part of the compulsory paper not as a  self-paced learning but when i have to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4562880,4568719,justify i say that selfish learning  initially  at the examination level that is enough
ca4ImOJjBJI,4568719,4575520,but at a post qualification level we  have a certification on forensic so we  can do that in detail
ca4ImOJjBJI,4575520,4582800,similar is the case with ipc and other  things so madam the point is set c and  said these are all are different thought
ca4ImOJjBJI,4582800,4589920,process why this categories are being  made is to be understood by people very  well point number one
ca4ImOJjBJI,4589920,4595840,your question number one question number  two is with regards to this uh you know  cost
ca4ImOJjBJI,4595840,4602400,strategy cost management and performance  evaluation so technically what is  happening is at the intermediate level
ca4ImOJjBJI,4602400,4607840,costing on the final level fasting more  or less it is actually a repetitive
ca4ImOJjBJI,4607840,4614000,apart from the level of question which  we are asking so instead of teaching  that particular thing we have integra we
ca4ImOJjBJI,4614000,4620159,have introduced the concept of  integrated business solution paper that  we can talk at a later point in time but
ca4ImOJjBJI,4620159,4626560,at this stage cost performance  evaluation strategy cost management and  performance evaluation if this is moved
ca4ImOJjBJI,4626560,4631920,towards a case-based learning and the  cases have been discussed in self-paced
ca4ImOJjBJI,4631920,4637440,learning and the questions are created  mcqs are created online test which has
ca4ImOJjBJI,4637440,4642880,been created based on the case  scenario based learning rather than you
ca4ImOJjBJI,4642880,4649760,know writing a paper which is very  theoretical or might be the mathematical  number it's something which we wanted to
ca4ImOJjBJI,4649760,4654960,take towards analytical thinking rather  than anything else so this is in total
ca4ImOJjBJI,4654960,4660880,the answer for both the things  i accept thank you sir uh so now now we
ca4ImOJjBJI,4660880,4667760,come to the final level uh we are coming  to uh  sir i'll i'm not going to repeat 8 uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,4667760,4673600,reduction from 8 to 6 because that has  already been answered  uh i'm coming to another pertinent
ca4ImOJjBJI,4673600,4681040,question that is what is the need to  integrate ethics and information  technology with every subject at the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4681040,4689239,final level  why can't information technology be a  separate subject in itself
ca4ImOJjBJI,4700159,4706960,is that ethics is a very very important  part of the whole curriculum and
ca4ImOJjBJI,4707840,4714000,uh and therefore it is uh it was thought  fit that ethics is inculcated in every
ca4ImOJjBJI,4714000,4720159,aspect of the student learning  uh for example let us say ethics in  taxation you know it would make the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4720159,4726800,distinction between the avenues for tax  planning and tax avoidance very clear
ca4ImOJjBJI,4726800,4734239,so you know while the foreign say about  tax planning it is in accordance with  the law whereas tax avoidance is there
ca4ImOJjBJI,4734239,4741520,have been ethical layers in the past  which i would not dwell upon in detail  right now but one of the reasons for uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,4741520,4748960,that is one of the reasons for  integrating ethics in each of the  core papers at the final level and at
ca4ImOJjBJI,4748960,4754480,each level for each subject uh what are  the ethical requirements uh for a member
ca4ImOJjBJI,4754480,4760840,uh i would say uh going forward post  qualification that is expected that is  what would be the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4760840,4766719,integration uh coming to information  technology uh like i mentioned earlier  also
ca4ImOJjBJI,4766719,4772960,that it is just to ensure uh in every  core area that uh the issues that are  arising out of the information
ca4ImOJjBJI,4772960,4778080,technology in each of these and how the  same you know they need to be addressed
ca4ImOJjBJI,4778080,4784000,we have the digital technology coming  into all the aspects of
ca4ImOJjBJI,4784000,4789040,of our curriculum  or i would say even into our day-to-day  practice when we talk of direct tax when
ca4ImOJjBJI,4789040,4795600,we talk of indirect text  technology has taken over all the fields  and therefore it was thought that rather
ca4ImOJjBJI,4795600,4801120,than having a general paper general  discussion on ethics
ca4ImOJjBJI,4801120,4808719,our information technology it would be  more important to have specific uh  subject related technological skill sets
ca4ImOJjBJI,4808719,4814800,that can be uh imparted as training to  the  students so like you have taxation
ca4ImOJjBJI,4814800,4820639,issues which arise due to the digital  economy or you have the measures that  are taken by the government to overcome
ca4ImOJjBJI,4820639,4826639,such issues uh like having special tax  provisions and all the equalization  levels when we talk about the direct tax
ca4ImOJjBJI,4826639,4833199,and international tax i would also go to  the extent that you know when we talk of  audits there are various bots which are
ca4ImOJjBJI,4833199,4838560,available which would help in sampling  which would help in the  various aspects of the audits and
ca4ImOJjBJI,4838560,4844880,therefore integrating the for  information technology with an auditing  paper would help students understand and
ca4ImOJjBJI,4844880,4851120,also practically learn about the various  tools and the technological advances  that can be done in the uh auditing
ca4ImOJjBJI,4851120,4857679,paper so is the reason why i would say  ethics and information technology is  proposed to be integrated into all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4857679,4863360,core papers  i hope that has answered the question  ma'am
ca4ImOJjBJI,4863360,4868800,yes sir sir in totality sir thank you  sir uh now come to the next question
ca4ImOJjBJI,4868800,4875840,that is about the  integrated business solution  multi-disciplinary case study
ca4ImOJjBJI,4876159,4882960,from the stakeholder site i think  specially from the student side this  question is there why is this paper been
ca4ImOJjBJI,4882960,4888960,made compulsory because in the current  scheme it is one of the optional  subjects
ca4ImOJjBJI,4888960,4895600,they are saying why you have made it  compulsory  chairman sir
ca4ImOJjBJI,4895600,4901360,uh this is one of my favorite  uh papers rather i will say
ca4ImOJjBJI,4901360,4907520,friends uh one thing which i would like  to tell if you see the entire concept  which we have introduced in the new
ca4ImOJjBJI,4907520,4914560,thread  right  is something which is  just if you see the 360 degree view
ca4ImOJjBJI,4914560,4921760,sorry if you see the 360 degree view of  the entire current you will understand  and appreciate the way we have actually
ca4ImOJjBJI,4921760,4927360,framed the entire structure  yes we might be short in certain thing
ca4ImOJjBJI,4927360,4932719,we might be long in certain things but  the point is very simple  that
ca4ImOJjBJI,4932719,4940159,when we want to produce a chartered  accountant from institute he should be  an all-arounder in proof sense
ca4ImOJjBJI,4940159,4945920,that means  a student who is doing an article in  appropriately concern or a student who
ca4ImOJjBJI,4945920,4951199,is doing articles in a large firm  they both have different limitations
ca4ImOJjBJI,4951199,4956960,also of learning  example i did my articles where i didn't  do income tax at all i have done only
ca4ImOJjBJI,4956960,4962400,the income uh you know  saturday audits and planets some other  student will be there wisdom only tax
ca4ImOJjBJI,4962400,4968639,work  so what is happening is when we are  actually seeing the outcome of the  chartered accountant who is coming in
ca4ImOJjBJI,4968639,4974800,the market in that particular case  those people are lacking somewhere so by
ca4ImOJjBJI,4974800,4982480,getting this paper on  what we have done in the process is  please understand income tax gst company
ca4ImOJjBJI,4982480,4988800,law financial reporting costing  uh you know  direct tax indirect tax whatever all
ca4ImOJjBJI,4988800,4995040,papers combinations  and including certain portion which will  be picked up by the student uh in the
ca4ImOJjBJI,4995040,5000880,self-paced learning are going to be  integrated into 30 or 40 page case study
ca4ImOJjBJI,5000880,5008080,and the 30 or 40 page case study will  have might be five questions three  questions ten questions i don't know but
ca4ImOJjBJI,5008080,5014320,those questions will be to design the  entire thing by keeping the 360 degree  view of the subjects which you have
ca4ImOJjBJI,5014320,5019360,learned over a period of time i am  pretty confident that you know madam
ca4ImOJjBJI,5019360,5026080,a lot of people who have qualified  including you and me who have qualified  vishal who is qualified we all will be
ca4ImOJjBJI,5026080,5031600,tempted to write the paper only for  you know enjoying to write that paper
ca4ImOJjBJI,5031600,5038159,not for anything and more importantly  friends let me just share with you what  is the value of this integrated business
ca4ImOJjBJI,5038159,5044639,solution paper is  3 lakh 50 000 chartered accountants are  there in india and out of the three lakh
ca4ImOJjBJI,5044639,5050480,if i talk about three lakh fifty  thousand i talk about only one percent  which is three thousand five hundred
ca4ImOJjBJI,5050480,5057440,people if those three thousand five  hundred people  narrate their experience in 25-30 pages
ca4ImOJjBJI,5057440,5063440,of their life experience  just imagine the kind of knowledge which  is going to be disseminated to our
ca4ImOJjBJI,5063440,5070000,students who are going to be highly  qualified in time to come  please understand 3000 which includes my
ca4ImOJjBJI,5070000,5075600,father and many such people who have  been part of the profession from a large
ca4ImOJjBJI,5075600,5081360,perspective whether it is from industry  whether it is from practice but they  combine that entire thing and give it to
ca4ImOJjBJI,5081360,5087600,us as their knowledge sharing  3500 case studies i think we will be the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5087600,5094239,biggest institute in the world with  regards to that kind of case scenario  bank so that please understand we want
ca4ImOJjBJI,5094239,5101199,our students to be thoroughly enjoying  their learning so this integrated case  study will give answers to all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5101199,5108960,learning what you have done  right which is 20  minus 1 is equal to 19 19 is equal to 1
ca4ImOJjBJI,5108960,5115760,that's a very simple message i would  like to give that's it so  vice chairman of mathematics
ca4ImOJjBJI,5115760,5121760,cannot be equal to one but yes in the  value wise it will be equal to one
ca4ImOJjBJI,5121760,5127800,so ninety nothing equal to one you do  one plus nine and zero
ca4ImOJjBJI,5139199,5144800,uh the next questions are i'm posing it  to the vice chairman sir  uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,5144800,5150719,why is open book or restricted a  restricted open book pattern being  introduced
ca4ImOJjBJI,5150719,5156239,uh i think students are apprehending  uh that this would increase the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5156239,5160079,difficulty level of the papers
ca4ImOJjBJI,5162800,5170080,so am i audible am i audible yes yes yes  yes yes so what i would respond to this
ca4ImOJjBJI,5170080,5176400,basically  is that uh  even internationally i believe that open
ca4ImOJjBJI,5176400,5182560,book restricted open book is the norm as  on now  in the existing scheme also at the final
ca4ImOJjBJI,5182560,5188320,level the  higher level of analytical evaluation  synthesis skills they are being assessed
ca4ImOJjBJI,5188320,5194880,and complexity of the level of papers at  the final level is high even as on today  and like i said we have the three levels
ca4ImOJjBJI,5194880,5200719,the basic the working and the expert  knowledge that is expected at the three  levels presently
ca4ImOJjBJI,5200719,5208239,so when we look at the open book or the  restricted open book uh the two aspects
ca4ImOJjBJI,5208239,5213920,to it that i would say one is that when  we talk of the  close book what is expected is uh rote
ca4ImOJjBJI,5213920,5220480,learning and that is one thing that  we want to minimize in the see a  curriculum you know where people learn
ca4ImOJjBJI,5220480,5227120,everything and then they're answering  the papers that is uh one of the things  that gets uh encouraged when we have a
ca4ImOJjBJI,5227120,5233840,close book uh  scenario uh but when it comes to  open book what is expected from the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5233840,5240800,student is that they have the guide with  them what is expected is that they are  able to interpret they should know where
ca4ImOJjBJI,5240800,5246960,to look for the  references uh when we talk of the open  book or the restricted open book they
ca4ImOJjBJI,5246960,5253040,should know how to interpret the various  provisions that are there maybe with  respect to law or any other subject and
ca4ImOJjBJI,5253040,5259840,they should be able to  uh analyze that and  present that by in the answer papers
ca4ImOJjBJI,5259840,5264880,when it comes to the  open book examination so if i if i look
ca4ImOJjBJI,5264880,5270800,practically you know  even in my office today if somebody  comes and asks me something on an income
ca4ImOJjBJI,5270800,5276639,tax i might open the book on the income  tax act and then respond to the  client or the query you know in a very
ca4ImOJjBJI,5276639,5283199,similar way if i look at it that i am  actually encouraging the student to use  the references to use the law also in
ca4ImOJjBJI,5283199,5289520,fact just for the clarity of students  the restricted open book would be where  the bear act is allowed to be carried in
ca4ImOJjBJI,5289520,5295280,the examination hall now this is what is  the  restricted open book and so when i'm
ca4ImOJjBJI,5295280,5301199,answer  answering questions what am i expecting  the students is they should be aware of  the various provisions they have the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5301199,5308159,reference material handy and they should  be able to analyze interpret and answer  in accordance
ca4ImOJjBJI,5308159,5313280,or whatever is expected so  it would be might increase the level but
ca4ImOJjBJI,5313280,5320320,at the same time it is very very  practical because that is what the  students will be  doing maybe post qualification this is
ca4ImOJjBJI,5320320,5326159,how it is it gets balanced  right sir sir thank you very much
ca4ImOJjBJI,5326159,5331920,uh for all your clarification sir uh sir  i come to the exit route now sir uh so
ca4ImOJjBJI,5331920,5338080,two questions i'll be asking sir to the  chairman sir uh sir uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,5338080,5344960,i think the stakeholders are having that  particular doubt in their mind that uh  once if we introduce the business
ca4ImOJjBJI,5344960,5351520,accounting associate  this particular certificate if we  introduce whether it will bring
ca4ImOJjBJI,5351520,5355679,competition for the chartered  accountants
ca4ImOJjBJI,5358960,5364080,i i really  get a little confused with that question
ca4ImOJjBJI,5364080,5368080,because uh what is the competition
ca4ImOJjBJI,5369920,5375920,how ca is going to compete with the full  ca or a member in practice who is there
ca4ImOJjBJI,5375920,5381120,whose signature is only authenticated by  uden will be a competition
ca4ImOJjBJI,5381120,5386480,right so this is only your recognition  friends  let me just tell you
ca4ImOJjBJI,5386480,5394080,in last 73 years  there have been lacks of people who have  been part of the ca curriculum ca
ca4ImOJjBJI,5394080,5399440,they have been associated with institute  unfortunately for some other reason they
ca4ImOJjBJI,5399440,5404560,have not completed their cia course  that means they are not even it's not
ca4ImOJjBJI,5404560,5410880,like that they are not qualified enough  they have completed their intermediate  they have completed their half course
ca4ImOJjBJI,5410880,5416639,and this is the requirement of the law  that we need to introduce an easy exit  route for the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,5416639,5422560,now what we are trying to do with this  is we are actually going to get the  recognition for all those people who are
ca4ImOJjBJI,5422560,5428320,lost in the process  that means  he or she has invested five to six years
ca4ImOJjBJI,5428320,5435440,seven years eight years that's the  reason the person could not complete his  senior course and unfortunately he could
ca4ImOJjBJI,5435440,5442000,not clear examination and could not be  associated with the membership so he has  lost the touch  so one is basically and these people are
ca4ImOJjBJI,5442000,5449040,also right there even if i am proud to  say one thing forget about final  examination forget about
ca4ImOJjBJI,5449040,5455920,intermediate there are people who could  not even clear intermediate examination  for whatever reason
ca4ImOJjBJI,5455920,5462480,today they are being regarded as some of  the some of the people are regarded as  one of the best accountants in the world
ca4ImOJjBJI,5462480,5468239,and really we are proud that none of  those people are actually sleeping empty
ca4ImOJjBJI,5468239,5475360,stomach  the chartered accountancy course has  given them that willpower to actually
ca4ImOJjBJI,5475360,5482400,work very hard  qualitatively be there in the market  deliver the desired result and be
ca4ImOJjBJI,5482400,5489360,available in the market in all through  the entire process  what is it wrong that we recognize them
ca4ImOJjBJI,5489360,5496639,with the certificate we are not giving  them a degree it's primarily it's not  going to be competition how it can be a
ca4ImOJjBJI,5496639,5502960,competition at all chartered accountant  is a chartered accountant he cannot say  that i am vba chartered accountant right
ca4ImOJjBJI,5502960,5510000,it's primarily he's a baby  so what is happening in this entire  process is most of the time people think
ca4ImOJjBJI,5510000,5516320,that you know they are getting into ca  and qualifying is difficult and my child  might not get a
ca4ImOJjBJI,5516320,5522719,you know final degree so what we are  trying to do is we are giving that  identity to those people at a larger
ca4ImOJjBJI,5522719,5528960,level that the baa at least will be  available but the ba will be available
ca4ImOJjBJI,5528960,5536480,for those students who have completed  both groups of intermediate completed  self-paced learning completed gm ces
ca4ImOJjBJI,5536480,5541920,completed itt so these are the four  things which they need to complete in  total then only they will be eligible to
ca4ImOJjBJI,5541920,5549520,get the ba degree  also  i am happy to say that the council in  its wisdom has also been deliberating
ca4ImOJjBJI,5549520,5555920,why only for the new course there might  be people who have been qualified  semi-qualified in past
ca4ImOJjBJI,5555920,5561920,why not they be given an opportunity to  apply for ba there is lot deliberation  but yes
ca4ImOJjBJI,5561920,5567440,we are going to believe in your concept  if you think it is right what council is
ca4ImOJjBJI,5567440,5574239,taking what council is thinking to  recognize these people identify you know  the identity of the people has been made
ca4ImOJjBJI,5574239,5580480,at the national level at a larger level  i think this is something which we need  to really look from a larger heart
ca4ImOJjBJI,5580480,5586960,rather than thinking from a conservative  approach  always i say if a person has a
ca4ImOJjBJI,5586960,5593600,tendency of doing wrong  he is always going to do wrong if a  person who doesn't want to do wrong will
ca4ImOJjBJI,5593600,5598960,always continue to do wrong and more  importantly in the forensic course i  always say
ca4ImOJjBJI,5598960,5606159,madam point to be noted  frauds are intentions and intentions  cannot be audited if the intention of
ca4ImOJjBJI,5606159,5613760,the people is to defraud or do something  wrong with the beha  institute is there to take right action
ca4ImOJjBJI,5613760,5619760,but the point is the intent of institute  also is to be understood in true sense
ca4ImOJjBJI,5619760,5624960,and yes we are waiting for your comments  we want your comments if maximum people
ca4ImOJjBJI,5624960,5631120,say that yes this is required that will  be required if no  we have to go with the majority that's
ca4ImOJjBJI,5631120,5637440,simple  thank you thank you thank you sir sir in  your uh clarification you have given
ca4ImOJjBJI,5637440,5642719,answer to my second question which i was  about to post to you that whether ba
ca4ImOJjBJI,5642719,5649520,certificate would be given to those  students who have qualified intermediate  examination through the existing course
ca4ImOJjBJI,5649520,5655840,so you have answered that also  yes  all those who have already done it under
ca4ImOJjBJI,5655840,5662080,the previous scheme or in the existing  scheme  with the additional uh eligibility
ca4ImOJjBJI,5662080,5667760,criteria like sarah's which uh apprised  you about you'll be able to get the ba
ca4ImOJjBJI,5667760,5674320,certificate also  right uh thank you sir uh uh sir uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,5674320,5680239,if you permit one or two questions on  the  transitional scheme sir
ca4ImOJjBJI,5680239,5687119,sir students are having certain doubts  in their minds  like answer in the in the market also
ca4ImOJjBJI,5687119,5693760,like everywhere people are talking  people are apprehensive as to when the  new scheme is going to launch
ca4ImOJjBJI,5693760,5701280,and if they're in this old scheme what  will happen to them what they should  study whether in the old or in the new
ca4ImOJjBJI,5701280,5707040,lot of apprehensions are there sir  and accordingly sir uh just uh from my
ca4ImOJjBJI,5707040,5713119,side sir i'm uh trying to apprise  everybody  uh students please don't get misled by
ca4ImOJjBJI,5713119,5718639,what is being talked  wait for the institute to come out with
ca4ImOJjBJI,5718639,5724000,the transition scheme  all your doubts will be put to rest  and
ca4ImOJjBJI,5724000,5729360,the council is going to take care that  none of the students are being
ca4ImOJjBJI,5729360,5734639,they are having any hardships  so the transition scheme will be drafted
ca4ImOJjBJI,5734639,5740480,in such a way that the concerns of all  the existing students will be taken care  of
ca4ImOJjBJI,5740480,5745520,uh sir if you would like to add on that  sir  sure
ca4ImOJjBJI,5745520,5751679,uh just one quick thing is for all the  students who are pursuing their  examination please understand
ca4ImOJjBJI,5751679,5758719,uh when you talk about two years  articles these articles people have  already registered for three years  articles now we might actually come out
ca4ImOJjBJI,5758719,5765600,we are planning we are putting our  fingers close in the month of november  we are planning to  release the new syllabus but again that
ca4ImOJjBJI,5765600,5773119,will be applicable either from may 23 or  november 23. even today i cannot answer  or no one can answer so the point is
ca4ImOJjBJI,5773119,5779040,very clear  that whenever the council is going to  agree to it and whenever the council is
ca4ImOJjBJI,5779040,5785280,going to decide and the approach of  transition will be considered and that  will be communicated to the people point
ca4ImOJjBJI,5785280,5792080,number one so don't get panic with the  new syllabus old syllabus what is going  to happen you cannot leave a syllabus or
ca4ImOJjBJI,5792080,5798960,an  attempt or a  year because of the new syllabus coming  in it will be ultimately equal to that
ca4ImOJjBJI,5798960,5805840,at the end of the day so it's worth at  this point in time if you are studying  eight papers example for final study
ca4ImOJjBJI,5805840,5811520,eight papers what is wrong two more  papers learning either you will do it in  self pace or you will do it in
ca4ImOJjBJI,5811520,5817840,examination if god agrees everything  goes well you might have to only write  the six papers not the two papers so
ca4ImOJjBJI,5817840,5823440,there will be a probability there will  be discussions which will happen in the  council and based on that only the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5823440,5831440,decision will be put before you all  people so please don't get panic don't  get excited don't get confused please
ca4ImOJjBJI,5831440,5837119,take it from me i see i at always in the  history and now and in the near future
ca4ImOJjBJI,5837119,5844159,and time to come also we are going to  take a very calculated decision for our  students so be restricted on that side
ca4ImOJjBJI,5844159,5849360,so my suggestion is wait you are doing  your course continue doing your course
ca4ImOJjBJI,5849360,5856960,learning two more papers will not hamper  you it is only going to educate you more  so that be better and god forbid if that
ca4ImOJjBJI,5856960,5863119,is coming back to the old one you have  lost your time so don't do that please  my suggestion my humble suggestion to
ca4ImOJjBJI,5863119,5869040,all you students please continue doing  it anything from vishal by side is there  ah
ca4ImOJjBJI,5869040,5875840,you can ask  uh  sir why chairman said uh sir uh you
ca4ImOJjBJI,5875840,5881960,don't have anything else no sir you are  also okay with this thought process
ca4ImOJjBJI,5885920,5892000,uh sir uh  actually about the transition scheme lot  of uh apprehensions that students are
ca4ImOJjBJI,5892000,5899600,having  so uh in this country we were just  trying to clear the doubts of the  students like say for example i am
ca4ImOJjBJI,5899600,5906800,giving an example sir a student who has  registered  in the foundation now suppose a student
ca4ImOJjBJI,5906800,5915679,is registering after first july  but but before first of january 2023
ca4ImOJjBJI,5915679,5921760,the doubt is whether they'll be  appearing in the old one or in the new  one so sir uh the
ca4ImOJjBJI,5921760,5926880,the students we are advising students  that may 23 what they are studying they
ca4ImOJjBJI,5926880,5933520,will continue to  study for that  because we will change like sarah said
ca4ImOJjBJI,5933520,5938560,the scheme is not going to change  overnight sufficient time will be given
ca4ImOJjBJI,5938560,5943679,for conversions also and there are no  conversion as such because papers are
ca4ImOJjBJI,5943679,5950560,almost going to remain the same so  students who are registered in the  intermediate are eligible for may 23
ca4ImOJjBJI,5950560,5956880,will continue to give that exam only  students of foundation will also  continue to do that
ca4ImOJjBJI,5956880,5964400,and the dates when the scheme is going  to be applicable for all the levels will  be given sufficient time to the students
ca4ImOJjBJI,5964400,5970560,so then they are aware and there is no  hardship for the students  i think sir uh

ca4ImOJjBJI,6082960,6089440,way forward  uh sir uh  uh if i can uh request by challenger
ca4ImOJjBJI,6089440,6094719,money point we actually missed out on  the international curriculum  uh
ca4ImOJjBJI,6094719,6100159,uh international curriculum friends is  uh just to take it  uh before you all
ca4ImOJjBJI,6100159,6106400,see the international curriculum has  been proposed from an ep 2020 point of  view and more importantly the advantage
ca4ImOJjBJI,6106400,6113520,which ici sets in today  with 67 international chapters with more  than 35 countries spread across
ca4ImOJjBJI,6113520,6118719,and the competition which we are seeing  in at a global level it is pertinent
ca4ImOJjBJI,6118719,6124560,that you know ici also gives a  representation at the international  level  so now there are two categories of
ca4ImOJjBJI,6124560,6130159,countries which will know three  categories of countries which will be  divided one is one advanced level
ca4ImOJjBJI,6130159,6136080,number two is growing economy and third  is basically where there is no  accounting profession and there are good
ca4ImOJjBJI,6136080,6141520,number of countries where there is no  regulating uh body which is doing  accounting profession so what we are
ca4ImOJjBJI,6141520,6148960,trying to do please understand in the  international curriculum that as a india  should leave a footprint on a global for
ca4ImOJjBJI,6148960,6154000,you know a scenario which we are doing  today and being called as third largest
ca4ImOJjBJI,6154000,6159840,economy in the world and we are looking  into uh nep2020 which specifically talks
ca4ImOJjBJI,6159840,6167840,about internationalization of post  graduation courses  and much more is there so and there is
ca4ImOJjBJI,6167840,6173440,again scpc talks about export of ca  services next we are talking about a
ca4ImOJjBJI,6173440,6178800,country which is the youngest country in  the world which is called india versus  the global economies and most of the
ca4ImOJjBJI,6178800,6185920,places the population has come down  drastically the youth is not there not  many accountants are coming up
ca4ImOJjBJI,6185920,6193760,just imagine considering all these  factors people might talk different but  dreaming is my right right let me dream
ca4ImOJjBJI,6193760,6201280,let ici dream something very good that  you know we can contribute to the nation  and the world in a true sense and we are
ca4ImOJjBJI,6201280,6207760,actually planning to go and do a  international curriculum which is  country specific subjects are going to
ca4ImOJjBJI,6207760,6212880,come so those country specific subjects  like income tax corporate law
ca4ImOJjBJI,6212880,6218480,vac or gst whatever is there apart from  the financial reporting which is india's
ca4ImOJjBJI,6218480,6223600,right accounting which is accounting and  a clean clean manner then you talk about
ca4ImOJjBJI,6223600,6229600,any other topics which are there that  are going to be restricted for that  particular purpose only now when a
ca4ImOJjBJI,6229600,6236480,student wants to do a course  internationally which has been launched  by ici  is it that that co student will who's
ca4ImOJjBJI,6236480,6242560,qualified from that particular country  will be allowed to practice in india the  answer may be big no maybe maybe big no
ca4ImOJjBJI,6242560,6248080,because he is not knowing the indian  laws so maybe there will be a  probability like when we have mris and
ca4ImOJjBJI,6248080,6253520,moves with various countries in that  case they have to write or we have to  write the paper specific to the
ca4ImOJjBJI,6253520,6260239,countries so those students will be told  to write country specific and then only  practicing right might be given again so
ca4ImOJjBJI,6260239,6267920,that is a detailed deliberation first  let us take our course internationally  and make chartered accountants ici be a
ca4ImOJjBJI,6267920,6274320,global body rather than indian body  alone which is already there we are a  global body with 67 international
ca4ImOJjBJI,6274320,6280400,chapters so international chapters  curriculum we have missed out so i  thought it was very important and
ca4ImOJjBJI,6280400,6286080,pertinent to take up that  discussion then i have received one or  two mails which are there and which
ca4ImOJjBJI,6286080,6292880,talked about international curriculum  competing institutes like when you talk  about corporate law or
ca4ImOJjBJI,6292880,6300000,in in you know  costing  we are not eliminating in this entire  discussion you have understood very well
ca4ImOJjBJI,6300000,6305760,it is not going to be so simple in the  integrated case study integrated with  integrated business solution corporate
ca4ImOJjBJI,6305760,6310880,governance will be one of the most  important part  so when we are going to come out with
ca4ImOJjBJI,6310880,6316880,certain sample case studies people will  understand and appreciate that we are  not diluted we have rather strengthen
ca4ImOJjBJI,6316880,6323280,and we want a qualitative  output to come out of a student so  please understand it is not a
ca4ImOJjBJI,6323280,6329600,competition with any anyone ici is  independent ici will remain independent
ca4ImOJjBJI,6329600,6334880,ici has been strongest world's second  largest accounting body we just aspire
ca4ImOJjBJI,6334880,6341840,to be the world's first accounting body  in short time if we have this kind of  aspirations we can continue doing some
ca4ImOJjBJI,6341840,6346960,good quality work so please understand  competitive institute is not our idea at
ca4ImOJjBJI,6346960,6352400,all they are independent they are driven  by the indian regulations they are  driven with the separate act and
ca4ImOJjBJI,6352400,6359360,legislature we are driven with the  separate thing so there is no com point  of competition in this entire process
ca4ImOJjBJI,6359360,6366639,then difference where for two years and  three years vishal is very nicely  covered  explaining what is the concept bas
ca4ImOJjBJI,6366639,6373679,certification i have told what is my  view almighty most of the people view in  this entire process and then all three
ca4ImOJjBJI,6373679,6378960,years training in industry let me just  tell you friends uh people are thinking  and deliberating with regards to
ca4ImOJjBJI,6378960,6385760,industry and practice industry and  practice  please understand chartered accountant  is a chartered accountant
ca4ImOJjBJI,6385760,6392400,only the choice is whether he wants to  go in practice or he wants to go in  industry but fundamentally when we want
ca4ImOJjBJI,6392400,6398840,to go back to 1949  please understand this  profession is
ca4ImOJjBJI,6398840,6404880,for practice  employment has been an outcome or might
ca4ImOJjBJI,6404880,6410560,be ancillary benefit in a period of time  when the economies have grown and
ca4ImOJjBJI,6410560,6417280,importance and demand for chartered  accountants have increased so the  fundamental thing is let us not create a
ca4ImOJjBJI,6417280,6423520,discrimination between member in  practice member in industry so that is  one solution which i wanted to tell man
ca4ImOJjBJI,6423520,6429600,so now you take the  what do we do on the concluding side or  vishal bhai has any point to share he
ca4ImOJjBJI,6429600,6435199,can share them with go for a concluding  remark  right sir
ca4ImOJjBJI,6435199,6443039,vice chairman  of my concluding remark is just an  extension what madame said
ca4ImOJjBJI,6455360,6457840,like
ca4ImOJjBJI,6462320,6468800,it should not happen i'll give a very  simple example that let us say if a  person is in agreement with all the
ca4ImOJjBJI,6468800,6471280,provisions
ca4ImOJjBJI,6483040,6488080,five persons who have some suggestions  to give and they give some suggestions
ca4ImOJjBJI,6488080,6494000,then when it comes to us you know  instead of a ten to five ratio what we  would have is a two to five ratio and
ca4ImOJjBJI,6494000,6499119,therefore we would feel uh that these  stakeholders are overall requesting for
ca4ImOJjBJI,6499119,6505679,some changes that are proposed to be  carried out and that is where so whether  you are in agreement or
ca4ImOJjBJI,6505679,6512639,an event or you have suggestions  feedback is important from all of you  and the last day
ca4ImOJjBJI,6515199,6521679,because uh you know we have seen many  times that on last days the technology  does not support when there is a mad
ca4ImOJjBJI,6521679,6527280,rush i will be very candid about it and  so please uh ensure that uh by today
ca4ImOJjBJI,6527280,6534080,like tonight if it is possible or  earlier tomorrow you are able to log in  and give your feedback
ca4ImOJjBJI,6534080,6540400,uh we have improved on a lot on the  technology side i would say uh and  therefore it will be a very very smooth
