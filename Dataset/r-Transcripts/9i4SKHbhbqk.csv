9i4SKHbhbqk,160,4960,can't beat properly home-cooked popcorn
9i4SKHbhbqk,4960,7520,start off with just a touch of oil in
9i4SKHbhbqk,7520,8080,there
9i4SKHbhbqk,8080,11920,as it lightly starts to smoke
9i4SKHbhbqk,12000,16160,corn in so now get your lid
9i4SKHbhbqk,16160,19359,never leave it far away from you
9i4SKHbhbqk,19520,21840,sounds like it's raining it's not so
9i4SKHbhbqk,21840,23519,it's popcorn canals trying to
9i4SKHbhbqk,23519,27599,pop out boom
9i4SKHbhbqk,28840,32960,delicious just a little shake of the pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,32960,35520,get it going
9i4SKHbhbqk,37680,42320,and then lift that lid at your apparel
9i4SKHbhbqk,42320,45520,we see it's a
9i4SKHbhbqk,45520,48719,very exciting pan in there
9i4SKHbhbqk,48719,50079,and when all that little pitter patter
9i4SKHbhbqk,50079,54160,stops you know your popcorn is cooked
9i4SKHbhbqk,54160,57600,nice you could eat it fresh from the pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,57600,59760,but i've got another plan
9i4SKHbhbqk,59760,62559,i'm gonna make a salted caramel popcorn
9i4SKHbhbqk,62559,63520,start off with
9i4SKHbhbqk,63520,66479,your sugar into the hot pan never stir a
9i4SKHbhbqk,66479,68640,caramel otherwise it crystallizes
9i4SKHbhbqk,68640,71520,it's a salted caramel so a nice pinch of
9i4SKHbhbqk,71520,72000,salt
9i4SKHbhbqk,72000,75600,in there as well now once you've got it
9i4SKHbhbqk,75600,77200,to a really nice dark
9i4SKHbhbqk,77200,80320,caramel flavor stir in your butter very
9i4SKHbhbqk,80320,82720,carefully caramel is very very hot
9i4SKHbhbqk,82720,85119,half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda
9i4SKHbhbqk,85119,87040,kickstarts the reaction that gives the
9i4SKHbhbqk,87040,89439,caramel a honeycomb flavor
9i4SKHbhbqk,89439,92960,mix that in you'll see it
9i4SKHbhbqk,92960,96799,reacting almost like a large crunchy
9i4SKHbhbqk,96799,100079,in the bottom of your bowl now the gas
9i4SKHbhbqk,100079,100880,is off
9i4SKHbhbqk,100880,104479,and that camera has a nice dark rich
9i4SKHbhbqk,104479,107680,flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat
9i4SKHbhbqk,107680,109600,it with that incredible caramel
9i4SKHbhbqk,109600,112720,give that a good mix it's that easy
9i4SKHbhbqk,112720,115520,and it's gonna taste amazing lay that
9i4SKHbhbqk,115520,117520,nice and flat
9i4SKHbhbqk,117520,118960,once that cools down it becomes nice and
9i4SKHbhbqk,118960,120640,brittle we've got that nice salted
9i4SKHbhbqk,120640,121759,caramel flavor
9i4SKHbhbqk,121759,123200,which just takes popcorn to a complete
9i4SKHbhbqk,123200,125920,dim level whilst the popcorn cools down
9i4SKHbhbqk,125920,128239,it's onto my prawn tostada wonderful
9i4SKHbhbqk,128239,129440,prawns
9i4SKHbhbqk,129440,130640,i'm gonna marinate them first with a
9i4SKHbhbqk,130640,132879,little bit of garlic
9i4SKHbhbqk,132879,136239,nice and fine and don't worry if you
9i4SKHbhbqk,136239,138319,can't slice thinly just

9i4SKHbhbqk,155840,157120,really nice sort of
9i4SKHbhbqk,157120,160480,light fragrant salad radishes topped and

9i4SKHbhbqk,171280,172800,little bit of chili in there
9i4SKHbhbqk,172800,176160,and slice them on an angle

9i4SKHbhbqk,213280,215280,beautifully lastly roughly chopped
9i4SKHbhbqk,215280,217280,coriander and give it a mix
9i4SKHbhbqk,217280,220799,that is the perfect base for our tostada
9i4SKHbhbqk,220799,223200,the salad's ready now for the prawns and
9i4SKHbhbqk,223200,224879,don't be afraid of getting the pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,224879,228159,nice and hot teaspoon
9i4SKHbhbqk,228159,230879,of olive oil in
9i4SKHbhbqk,231360,232879,anything less than that sizzle when you

9i4SKHbhbqk,239200,241439,in there as well watch them change color
9i4SKHbhbqk,241439,244480,rapidly i'd rather cook them quicker
9i4SKHbhbqk,244480,247280,in a hotter pan and slower in a colder
9i4SKHbhbqk,247280,248000,pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,248000,250159,the difference in taste is night and day
9i4SKHbhbqk,250159,252000,the prawns will take just two minutes to
9i4SKHbhbqk,252000,253120,cook through
9i4SKHbhbqk,253120,257919,lime juice just over the top nice

9i4SKHbhbqk,261680,265840,these are corn tortilla quite robust
9i4SKHbhbqk,265840,267440,and it's a kind of base that doesn't
9i4SKHbhbqk,267440,269520,disintegrate hot pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,269520,273280,in it's a dry pan so

9i4SKHbhbqk,331039,332720,the most amazing
9i4SKHbhbqk,332720,334320,bold breakfast and it started off with
9i4SKHbhbqk,334320,336560,these beauties here murgays
9i4SKHbhbqk,336560,339520,cheap but incredibly tasty start off
9i4SKHbhbqk,339520,341120,with a nice hot pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,341120,345280,mug is in it's a very spicy sausage
9i4SKHbhbqk,345280,346639,doesn't need any help doesn't even need
9i4SKHbhbqk,346639,348960,chili just a touch
9i4SKHbhbqk,348960,352320,of salt and pepper
9i4SKHbhbqk,352320,355360,you can smell the spice they're starting
9i4SKHbhbqk,355360,356880,to release all that wonderful

9i4SKHbhbqk,362000,363520,garlic
9i4SKHbhbqk,363520,366240,spread the garlic across the pan it
9i4SKHbhbqk,366240,367600,instantly changes color
9i4SKHbhbqk,367600,370479,takes on this nice dark rich golden
9i4SKHbhbqk,370479,371759,color
9i4SKHbhbqk,371759,373759,now take a look with the heat out with
9i4SKHbhbqk,373759,375199,the parsley
9i4SKHbhbqk,375199,377199,the stalks of soft herbs like parsley
9i4SKHbhbqk,377199,378960,and coriander can be used to impart
9i4SKHbhbqk,378960,380160,flavour during cooking
9i4SKHbhbqk,380160,382080,but the leaves should always be added
9i4SKHbhbqk,382080,383600,just before serving to give
9i4SKHbhbqk,383600,385670,maximum colour and fragrance
9i4SKHbhbqk,385670,387039,[Music]
9i4SKHbhbqk,387039,390520,and then finish that off with my capers

9i4SKHbhbqk,399840,400720,hours old so they're
9i4SKHbhbqk,400720,403759,crispy on the outside and just slice off
9i4SKHbhbqk,403759,406960,the lid this recipe is a great way to
9i4SKHbhbqk,406960,407440,use up
9i4SKHbhbqk,407440,408960,any leftover croissants from the day
9i4SKHbhbqk,408960,411440,before i used to cringe when i
9i4SKHbhbqk,411440,412800,saw the french cooks throw away
9i4SKHbhbqk,412800,414720,croissants i used to cry thinking
9i4SKHbhbqk,414720,417919,oh my god any idea what you're throwing
9i4SKHbhbqk,417919,419759,away in terms of flavor
9i4SKHbhbqk,419759,422240,whatever you do do not wipe out that pan
9i4SKHbhbqk,422240,423039,dunk
9i4SKHbhbqk,423039,425360,your croissants mopping up all that
9i4SKHbhbqk,425360,426639,amazing flavor
9i4SKHbhbqk,426639,429680,and caramelizing the inside
9i4SKHbhbqk,429680,431759,for that beautiful and don't forget the
9i4SKHbhbqk,431759,433440,lids
9i4SKHbhbqk,433440,436800,and then get your thumbs and go inside
9i4SKHbhbqk,436800,438479,the croissant
9i4SKHbhbqk,438479,439840,all i want to do now is just create a
9i4SKHbhbqk,439840,441520,little pocket
9i4SKHbhbqk,441520,443199,and just manipulate the crescent now
9i4SKHbhbqk,443199,445360,this is where it gets exciting
9i4SKHbhbqk,445360,448840,mix up the capers the garlic and
9i4SKHbhbqk,448840,451199,sausages look at the color
9i4SKHbhbqk,451199,454800,of that wonderful delicious flavored
9i4SKHbhbqk,454800,458000,oil now some cheese but not just
9i4SKHbhbqk,458000,461120,any cheese fontina cheese is like the
9i4SKHbhbqk,461120,462960,number one cheese for grilling
9i4SKHbhbqk,462960,465759,and because it's a very rich cheese you
9i4SKHbhbqk,465759,466400,shave it
9i4SKHbhbqk,466400,468720,thinner than you would a white truffle
9i4SKHbhbqk,468720,470960,but it gives a really nice saltiness
9i4SKHbhbqk,470960,478240,and a light smoky flavour
9i4SKHbhbqk,478240,482879,salt place these big boys on the tray
9i4SKHbhbqk,482879,487120,literally 30 seconds on the grill
9i4SKHbhbqk,489280,493120,here we go nice
9i4SKHbhbqk,493120,496319,crisp packed full of flavor
9i4SKHbhbqk,496319,499520,now top them and that for me it's almost
9i4SKHbhbqk,499520,502639,like being back in paris
9i4SKHbhbqk,502639,504960,except this time i don't have to share
