djuysEjGGfw,160,1680,a lot of people ask me if i make art
djuysEjGGfw,1680,3280,with anything other than cake maybe an
djuysEjGGfw,3280,4720,art material that lasts longer than a
djuysEjGGfw,4720,6879,couple days i studied and worked with
djuysEjGGfw,6879,8639,traditional art media prior to cake but
djuysEjGGfw,8639,10559,over the past decade i focused solely on
djuysEjGGfw,10559,12080,sculpting with cake a lot of my cakes
djuysEjGGfw,12080,13679,are intentionally weird or goofy and
djuysEjGGfw,13679,15679,very much inspired by the pop surrealism
djuysEjGGfw,15679,17359,art movement but when people think of
djuysEjGGfw,17359,18880,art they don't typically think of cakes
djuysEjGGfw,18880,20320,i want to know what you think do you
djuysEjGGfw,20320,24160,consider my cake sculptures fine art
