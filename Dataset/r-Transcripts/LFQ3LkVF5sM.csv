LFQ3LkVF5sM,80,3679,this is not the future of the pc
LFQ3LkVF5sM,3679,6319,this is if the enthusiast in you screams
LFQ3LkVF5sM,6319,9440,that no you can't just replace gpus and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,9440,12719,cpus with integrated socs i am here to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,12719,16560,tell you that apple silicon gober apple
LFQ3LkVF5sM,16560,19119,obviously knows it and make no mistake
LFQ3LkVF5sM,19119,22640,intel amd and nvidia all know it too the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,22640,24320,writing is on the wall and now it's just
LFQ3LkVF5sM,24320,27599,a matter of time pcs need to change
LFQ3LkVF5sM,27599,29679,and i'm going to tell you how
LFQ3LkVF5sM,29679,31359,and why right after i tell you about our
LFQ3LkVF5sM,31359,34000,sponsor glasswire glasswire lets you see
LFQ3LkVF5sM,34000,36160,past and present network activity detect
LFQ3LkVF5sM,36160,38320,malware on your pc or android device and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,38320,39840,block its connections to prevent things
LFQ3LkVF5sM,39840,41920,from getting worse use offer code linus
LFQ3LkVF5sM,41920,45839,for 25 off at the link below
LFQ3LkVF5sM,53440,55360,a lot of you really liked our how to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,55360,57120,build a pc the last guide you'll ever
LFQ3LkVF5sM,57120,60079,need and i'm really glad that you do
LFQ3LkVF5sM,60079,62559,because it took so much effort to make
LFQ3LkVF5sM,62559,65119,but look at that run time and it could
LFQ3LkVF5sM,65119,66880,have been even longer
LFQ3LkVF5sM,66880,68960,think about how many components go into
LFQ3LkVF5sM,68960,71280,a typical pc build and then look at this
LFQ3LkVF5sM,71280,74320,unassuming little box the mac studio in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,74320,76560,our testing the m1 ultra variant pulled
LFQ3LkVF5sM,76560,78200,a grand total of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,78200,81600,223.4 watts from the wall under the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,81600,83600,heaviest load that we could give it and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,83600,85600,the m1 max version didn't even break
LFQ3LkVF5sM,85600,88159,three digits if we ignore the rosetta
LFQ3LkVF5sM,88159,91200,results they achieved 88 and 61 percent
LFQ3LkVF5sM,91200,94400,respectively of the core i9 12900k and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,94400,97280,rtx 3090 bench's overall performance in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,97280,99840,our productivity testing at just 34 and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,99840,103200,15 of the total system power at most the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,103200,104560,12 900k
LFQ3LkVF5sM,104560,107920,the cpu alone can draw more power than
LFQ3LkVF5sM,107920,111040,the whole m1 ultra mac studio and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,111040,112880,developers are still figuring out how to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,112880,115680,optimize for apple silicon now
LFQ3LkVF5sM,115680,117759,look at that pc and all its components
LFQ3LkVF5sM,117759,120000,again all the raw materials that go into
LFQ3LkVF5sM,120000,122320,making it what it is it's wasteful right
LFQ3LkVF5sM,122320,124560,in almost every way except economically
LFQ3LkVF5sM,124560,127200,it's not that x86 is inherently bad but
LFQ3LkVF5sM,127200,129840,it has limitations that even intel have
LFQ3LkVF5sM,129840,131920,tried to overcome themselves with
LFQ3LkVF5sM,131920,134560,projects like titanium while extensions
LFQ3LkVF5sM,134560,136480,have given it more life its complex
LFQ3LkVF5sM,136480,139120,instruction set design is at its core an
LFQ3LkVF5sM,139120,140720,old one that dates back to the late
LFQ3LkVF5sM,140720,145120,1970s literally every x86 based cpu
LFQ3LkVF5sM,145120,148160,boots up in 8086 compatibility mode and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,148160,151440,can in theory run software made for the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,151440,155280,og ibm pc precious die space and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,155280,156959,transistors are used for supporting
LFQ3LkVF5sM,156959,159040,instructions and modes that might be
LFQ3LkVF5sM,159040,161519,redundant or not even remotely useful
LFQ3LkVF5sM,161519,164160,today but must be there to maintain
LFQ3LkVF5sM,164160,166319,compatibility with the architecture and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,166319,168720,now if i'm intel or amd looking at my
LFQ3LkVF5sM,168720,171360,options i'm sweating a little and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,171360,173760,weighing a switch to arm while neither
LFQ3LkVF5sM,173760,176800,currently sells an armed cpu both hold
LFQ3LkVF5sM,176800,179519,armed licenses and amd is on record
LFQ3LkVF5sM,179519,181680,saying that they're willing and able to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,181680,184879,do it it wasn't that long ago even that
LFQ3LkVF5sM,184879,187360,intel had their own reduced instruction
LFQ3LkVF5sM,187360,190800,set cpu called the i860 and i-960 and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,190800,192400,you'd be kidding yourself if you thought
LFQ3LkVF5sM,192400,194080,they weren't prototyping stuff on the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,194080,195920,side like apple was when they were
LFQ3LkVF5sM,195920,198480,suffering through 14 nanometer plus plus
LFQ3LkVF5sM,198480,201200,plus a change in the pc industry would
LFQ3LkVF5sM,201200,202879,of course have a teething period like
LFQ3LkVF5sM,202879,204959,apple silicon is currently experiencing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,204959,208000,but it could eventually be a good thing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,208000,210159,and not just for efficiency think about
LFQ3LkVF5sM,210159,213200,it intel and amd are alone in the cpu
LFQ3LkVF5sM,213200,215519,race right now just like amd and nvidia
LFQ3LkVF5sM,215519,218799,are currently alone in the gpu race and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,218799,221280,if intel had their way in the 90s or in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,221280,224400,2015 there'd be only one
LFQ3LkVF5sM,224400,226000,thanks to intel's control over
LFQ3LkVF5sM,226000,227599,performance and efficiency enhancing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,227599,230400,extensions used on modern cpus like sse
LFQ3LkVF5sM,230400,232640,and avx and amd's control over the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,232640,235760,64-bit extensions that every desktop cpu
LFQ3LkVF5sM,235760,238159,since core 2 has used we don't have any
LFQ3LkVF5sM,238159,240400,other desktop cpu manufacturers anyone
LFQ3LkVF5sM,240400,242400,entering the x86 market would have to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,242400,244720,reverse engineer those extensions to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,244720,246799,compete because amd and intel have a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,246799,248159,technology sharing agreement that
LFQ3LkVF5sM,248159,250879,forbids sub licensing and expires if
LFQ3LkVF5sM,250879,253760,either company changes hands by contrast
LFQ3LkVF5sM,253760,256400,arm doesn't sell anything directly they
LFQ3LkVF5sM,256400,258400,develop the base specifications and then
LFQ3LkVF5sM,258400,260239,they license that to other companies who
LFQ3LkVF5sM,260239,261919,then have the option of tweaking and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,261919,263520,adding to those designs to tailor them
LFQ3LkVF5sM,263520,265919,to suit their needs this is how apple
LFQ3LkVF5sM,265919,268320,silicon came to be and if arm took off
LFQ3LkVF5sM,268320,270720,on the desktop we could see not only
LFQ3LkVF5sM,270720,273520,mobile players like qualcomm samsung and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,273520,275759,mediatek enter the ring but maybe google
LFQ3LkVF5sM,275759,277919,or even hp they used to make their own
LFQ3LkVF5sM,277919,280800,cpus once too and we can't forget nvidia
LFQ3LkVF5sM,280800,283759,whose last consumer arm soc uses gpu
LFQ3LkVF5sM,283759,286160,cores from 2014 and lives on in the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,286160,288800,nintendo switch and shield tv plus
LFQ3LkVF5sM,288800,291120,actually it's kind of bizarre that
LFQ3LkVF5sM,291120,293199,nvidia hasn't continued to produce
LFQ3LkVF5sM,293199,296080,consumer socs like perhaps contractual
LFQ3LkVF5sM,296080,297840,obligations within and outside of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,297840,299759,nvidia's control had something to do
LFQ3LkVF5sM,299759,301759,with it because not only were they close
LFQ3LkVF5sM,301759,304160,to straight up buying arm a sign that
LFQ3LkVF5sM,304160,305840,they knew times were changing but
LFQ3LkVF5sM,305840,308320,they're also still actively developing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,308320,311199,arm socs just not for consumers their
LFQ3LkVF5sM,311199,313120,grace data center soc for ali
LFQ3LkVF5sM,313120,315280,acceleration has a surprisingly similar
LFQ3LkVF5sM,315280,317120,level of integration to apple silicon on
LFQ3LkVF5sM,317120,319680,paper and is just begging to be scaled
LFQ3LkVF5sM,319680,321680,down so that consumers can use it just
LFQ3LkVF5sM,321680,324400,like the tesla's and not quadro gpus do
LFQ3LkVF5sM,324400,327600,with g-force but let's back up a sec
LFQ3LkVF5sM,327600,331759,duopoly aside if x86 is so bad and arm
LFQ3LkVF5sM,331759,335120,is so good why is x86 still the king of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,335120,338720,the pc well prior to apple silicon
LFQ3LkVF5sM,338720,342000,you'd be forgiven for thinking that arm
LFQ3LkVF5sM,342000,344240,chips simply can't perform
LFQ3LkVF5sM,344240,347759,like intel and amd qualcomm has a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,347759,350800,virtual monopoly over non-apple arm pcs
LFQ3LkVF5sM,350800,353039,and a literal monopoly in the windows
LFQ3LkVF5sM,353039,355039,ecosystem thanks to an exclusivity
LFQ3LkVF5sM,355039,357039,agreement with microsoft when that deal
LFQ3LkVF5sM,357039,358800,was penned it probably did make some
LFQ3LkVF5sM,358800,361280,sense qualcomm was the third biggest
LFQ3LkVF5sM,361280,364240,chip maker even as of mid-2020 and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,364240,366080,there's still a giant who's recently
LFQ3LkVF5sM,366080,368400,been eyeing a slice of the arm pie for
LFQ3LkVF5sM,368400,371039,themselves so assuming qualcomm would
LFQ3LkVF5sM,371039,373120,become the biggest supplier of desktop
LFQ3LkVF5sM,373120,375440,arm chips it made sense for microsoft to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,375440,377440,want to optimize for that hardware
LFQ3LkVF5sM,377440,379919,unfortunately for microsoft and for us
LFQ3LkVF5sM,379919,382240,there is no polite way to put this even
LFQ3LkVF5sM,382240,384639,qualcomm's latest chips suck which
LFQ3LkVF5sM,384639,386479,recently prompted google to follow
LFQ3LkVF5sM,386479,388319,samsung and apple and going their own
LFQ3LkVF5sM,388319,390160,way with tensor and may eventually
LFQ3LkVF5sM,390160,392000,prompt microsoft to do the same
LFQ3LkVF5sM,392000,394160,qualcomm's utter failure to compete in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,394160,396960,the pc space so far has given intel amd
LFQ3LkVF5sM,396960,399360,and especially nvidia precious breathing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,399360,401360,room and we're not saying that the pc as
LFQ3LkVF5sM,401360,403520,we know it is dead today it definitely
LFQ3LkVF5sM,403520,405600,still has some life left and they'll
LFQ3LkVF5sM,405600,408560,first probably try to integrate x86 socs
LFQ3LkVF5sM,408560,410080,more tightly before they consider
LFQ3LkVF5sM,410080,412160,switching over intel for example could
LFQ3LkVF5sM,412160,413919,very well be working on an soc that
LFQ3LkVF5sM,413919,416000,combines alder lake's efficiency cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,416000,417919,with a larger number of xc graphics
LFQ3LkVF5sM,417919,419680,cores and ai engine blocks taking the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,419680,421360,dye space that would otherwise have been
LFQ3LkVF5sM,421360,422960,allocated to the bigger performance
LFQ3LkVF5sM,422960,425759,cores even so reduced instruction set
LFQ3LkVF5sM,425759,427680,architectures proved their worth in the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,427680,430000,late 90s with early arm licenses and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,430000,432479,with power pc which was famously used in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,432479,435360,the first imax clock for clock power pc
LFQ3LkVF5sM,435360,437440,tended to outperform x86 by a wide
LFQ3LkVF5sM,437440,439199,margin though this did depend on the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,439199,441199,task and eventually powerpc hit a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,441199,442639,performance and efficiency wall just
LFQ3LkVF5sM,442639,445680,like x86 is today intel's titanium for
LFQ3LkVF5sM,445680,447599,its part was supposed to be a sort of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,447599,450319,successor to risk as a concept by using
LFQ3LkVF5sM,450319,453120,one hp termed explicitly parallel
LFQ3LkVF5sM,453120,456560,instruction computing or epic yes
LFQ3LkVF5sM,456560,458639,naming has always been bad unlike our
LFQ3LkVF5sM,458639,461280,swag it from ltdstore.com it describes
LFQ3LkVF5sM,461280,463680,exactly what it is a sweater and a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,463680,466560,jacket as we know today titanium didn't
LFQ3LkVF5sM,466560,469120,work out so well still even intel saw
LFQ3LkVF5sM,469120,471360,that the x86's days were numbered their
LFQ3LkVF5sM,471360,473599,plan for pentium 4 was more or less to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,473599,475599,just clock it as high as it would go and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,475599,477520,hope that the numbers kept going up and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,477520,479520,now that we're back to this phase again
LFQ3LkVF5sM,479520,481680,where we can't physically fit more cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,481680,483919,on a die because new process nodes are
LFQ3LkVF5sM,483919,485840,providing less additional density
LFQ3LkVF5sM,485840,487440,something's got to give
LFQ3LkVF5sM,487440,489840,the current solution stacking dies will
LFQ3LkVF5sM,489840,491840,only get you so far when you're already
LFQ3LkVF5sM,491840,495440,pushing 241 watts by comparison a lot of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,495440,497680,arm's advantages today come not strictly
LFQ3LkVF5sM,497680,499360,from its reduced instruction set but
LFQ3LkVF5sM,499360,500960,from how it's typically bundled into a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,500960,502639,system-on-chip configuration where
LFQ3LkVF5sM,502639,504560,virtually the entire computer is super
LFQ3LkVF5sM,504560,506639,close to the cpu cores why does this
LFQ3LkVF5sM,506639,508879,matter when we already have apus it's
LFQ3LkVF5sM,508879,511440,all about density and power draw simply
LFQ3LkVF5sM,511440,513680,expanding the size of the die isn't
LFQ3LkVF5sM,513680,515599,normally a good idea from power and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,515599,517919,thermal perspective but arm cores are
LFQ3LkVF5sM,517919,520560,typically much smaller than x86 and sip
LFQ3LkVF5sM,520560,523200,far less power so not only can you fit
LFQ3LkVF5sM,523200,525360,more of them into the same space
LFQ3LkVF5sM,525360,527279,you're also not as limited in terms of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,527279,530320,die size in general m1 ultra's die area
LFQ3LkVF5sM,530320,533600,is bigger than the rtx 3090 ti let's do
LFQ3LkVF5sM,533600,534880,a case study
LFQ3LkVF5sM,534880,538959,amd's 8 core ryzen 7 5700g desktop apus
LFQ3LkVF5sM,538959,541120,are somewhere between an m1 and m1 pro
LFQ3LkVF5sM,541120,543839,in terms of die size the apu dedicates
LFQ3LkVF5sM,543839,545839,just over a quarter of the utilized die
LFQ3LkVF5sM,545839,548800,space to cpu cores and cache alone and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,548800,551040,just 10 to the gpu for thermal
LFQ3LkVF5sM,551040,553120,management there's also a fair amount of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,553120,555600,unused white space even within the cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,555600,558080,themselves meanwhile even m1's big
LFQ3LkVF5sM,558080,560240,performance cpu cores are tiny by
LFQ3LkVF5sM,560240,562640,comparison with all cores taking just
LFQ3LkVF5sM,562640,565680,over 20 percent of that smaller die area
LFQ3LkVF5sM,565680,568000,the gpu takes up double the relative die
LFQ3LkVF5sM,568000,570560,space as the apu which means there's way
LFQ3LkVF5sM,570560,573519,more gpu horsepower on tap and still
LFQ3LkVF5sM,573519,575360,room for other functions like the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,575360,577600,massive media engine neural engine and
LFQ3LkVF5sM,577600,579600,storage controller there's very little
LFQ3LkVF5sM,579600,581680,white space by comparison not only are
LFQ3LkVF5sM,581680,583279,those arm cores efficient enough to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,583279,586080,handle such a compact layout but when so
LFQ3LkVF5sM,586080,587839,much of the system is contained within
LFQ3LkVF5sM,587839,589839,it significantly less energy has to be
LFQ3LkVF5sM,589839,591920,used for signaling which also happens to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,591920,593920,be much faster if we tried to push an
LFQ3LkVF5sM,593920,596240,x86 processor to these densities in
LFQ3LkVF5sM,596240,599120,proximity with this many gpu cores
LFQ3LkVF5sM,599120,600640,it would quickly become a thermal
LFQ3LkVF5sM,600640,602560,meltdown event sort of like the opposite
LFQ3LkVF5sM,602560,605200,of how alex had to save a frozen core i9
LFQ3LkVF5sM,605200,607920,12900 ks literally frozen go check it
LFQ3LkVF5sM,607920,609120,out on flow plane along with more
LFQ3LkVF5sM,609120,611040,exclusive when you're done here and it's
LFQ3LkVF5sM,611040,614320,scales m1 max sports a larger die than
LFQ3LkVF5sM,614320,617360,the rtx 3070 and m1 ultra is about a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,617360,620640,third again bigger than the rtx 3090 ti
LFQ3LkVF5sM,620640,622959,with the die that large the computy bits
LFQ3LkVF5sM,622959,625040,of the 3090 ti would take up roughly
LFQ3LkVF5sM,625040,627680,half the m1 ultra's die area while apple
LFQ3LkVF5sM,627680,629839,currently dedicates just over a third
LFQ3LkVF5sM,629839,631440,that means that if apple built a
LFQ3LkVF5sM,631440,633680,dedicated big chip design and weren't
LFQ3LkVF5sM,633680,635839,using their own metal api separate from
LFQ3LkVF5sM,635839,636959,the rest of the industry they
LFQ3LkVF5sM,636959,639440,legitimately could reach high-end gpu
LFQ3LkVF5sM,639440,642000,levels of real world performance a shame
LFQ3LkVF5sM,642000,644160,that apple had to go their own way
LFQ3LkVF5sM,644160,646640,but imagine if nvidia were to build such
LFQ3LkVF5sM,646640,647519,a thing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,647519,649120,they could corner the arm desktop or
LFQ3LkVF5sM,649120,651040,notebook space very quickly if
LFQ3LkVF5sM,651040,652880,developers were on board especially it's
LFQ3LkVF5sM,652880,654959,not as simple as gluing them together
LFQ3LkVF5sM,654959,656959,obviously and that geforce power
LFQ3LkVF5sM,656959,659120,consumption is still a problem but it's
LFQ3LkVF5sM,659120,661200,also not an impossible hurdle and with
LFQ3LkVF5sM,661200,663680,the success of apple silicon despite its
LFQ3LkVF5sM,663680,665839,growing pains it's impossible for the
LFQ3LkVF5sM,665839,667519,industry to ignore the advantages to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,667519,669600,this approach you can have excellent
LFQ3LkVF5sM,669600,671519,performance coupled with incredibly low
LFQ3LkVF5sM,671519,673200,power draw on a much more open
LFQ3LkVF5sM,673200,675839,architecture that allows for bigger or
LFQ3LkVF5sM,675839,677680,more aspirational system integrators to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,677680,679600,tweak things as they see fit this
LFQ3LkVF5sM,679600,681519,potential future will suck for
LFQ3LkVF5sM,681519,683200,enthusiasts who like getting their hands
LFQ3LkVF5sM,683200,685279,dirty but the alternative is laid bare
LFQ3LkVF5sM,685279,687680,before us power targets shooting up at
LFQ3LkVF5sM,687680,689279,record pace to the point where we're
LFQ3LkVF5sM,689279,690720,looking at new connectors to help
LFQ3LkVF5sM,690720,693360,deliver all the juice this generation of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,693360,696399,hardware now is already incredibly power
LFQ3LkVF5sM,696399,698720,hungry with intel and amd squeezing
LFQ3LkVF5sM,698720,700240,higher and higher frequencies out of
LFQ3LkVF5sM,700240,701920,their cores and nvidia rumored to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,701920,704320,require up to 600 watts for their
LFQ3LkVF5sM,704320,706959,next-gen top-end gpu there's really no
LFQ3LkVF5sM,706959,709600,backing down we have to ask ourselves
LFQ3LkVF5sM,709600,711760,is it worth it and at what point does it
LFQ3LkVF5sM,711760,713519,stop being worth it
LFQ3LkVF5sM,713519,714880,at least it's always worth listening to
LFQ3LkVF5sM,714880,717440,the segways the sponsors like backblaze
