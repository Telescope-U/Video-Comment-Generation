sbTcwlAGTgg,1373039,1377679,good job  that was so much fun
sbTcwlAGTgg,1378720,1385440,this campfire is so nice  well anytime there's a campfire you need
sbTcwlAGTgg,1385440,1391760,to be very safe yeah i made this  campfire and i'm actually a grown-up if
sbTcwlAGTgg,1391760,1397440,you didn't know children should never  make their own campfire and if there is
sbTcwlAGTgg,1397440,1402720,a campfire you should always have a  grown-up around you if they're not there
sbTcwlAGTgg,1402720,1409760,you should tell someone hey  grown-ups someone should come near the  campfire
sbTcwlAGTgg,1409760,1417440,and hey speaking of near the campfire  remember earlier i had this gallon of  water yeah it's about 3.8
sbTcwlAGTgg,1417440,1423360,liters  yeah you want to make sure you have  water near a campfire just in case if it
sbTcwlAGTgg,1423360,1431440,gets out of control you can pour some  water on the fire  and put it out but it's actually in a
sbTcwlAGTgg,1431440,1438640,controlled environment see this fire pit  that i made it in  yeah yeah it's not going to catch
sbTcwlAGTgg,1438640,1446400,anything on fire and that's another  thing you want to make sure there's no  branches or or leaves or anything above
sbTcwlAGTgg,1446400,1451919,it or around it  yeah  so now that we have a safe campfire i
sbTcwlAGTgg,1451919,1458960,think it's a perfect time  to make some s'mores  have you ever had a s'more before
sbTcwlAGTgg,1458960,1466080,they're so yummy  after a good healthy dinner you can have  a s'more here check it out
sbTcwlAGTgg,1466080,1472000,so we got some graham crackers  yeah and this is a rectangle but you
sbTcwlAGTgg,1472000,1479520,split it in half  and now you have two  squares yum
sbTcwlAGTgg,1479520,1484799,okay  and then  you also have  a cylinder
sbTcwlAGTgg,1484799,1490400,yeah that is a cylinder see that shape  but that's not what it's called this is
sbTcwlAGTgg,1490400,1496799,a marshmallow  and they're so yummy  okay i'll put that right there for now
sbTcwlAGTgg,1496799,1502640,okay actually you know what i should  probably be a little bit more organized  with this round
sbTcwlAGTgg,1502640,1508400,white  plate  all right then see this yummy chocolate
sbTcwlAGTgg,1508400,1515279,all right that's the third and final  ingredient of s'mores  i love chocolate yeah and there's
sbTcwlAGTgg,1515279,1520559,actually small rectangles  do you see them  yeah
sbTcwlAGTgg,1520559,1526880,small rectangles and it actually makes a  bigger rectangle when they're all  connected all right the first thing you
