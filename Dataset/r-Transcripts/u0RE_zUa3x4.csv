u0RE_zUa3x4,524150,527240,[Music]
u0RE_zUa3x4,529120,530240,a little bit different feeling because
u0RE_zUa3x4,530240,532160,before it was boiled in a different test
u0RE_zUa3x4,532160,533760,when you're eating food you should have
u0RE_zUa3x4,533760,536080,a varieties of chests you're speaking my
u0RE_zUa3x4,536080,536959,language
u0RE_zUa3x4,536959,538800,variety is the spice of life so the
u0RE_zUa3x4,538800,540640,other one was more full of water really
u0RE_zUa3x4,540640,542399,soft this is a little more like chewy
u0RE_zUa3x4,542399,544399,and like a harder outside some smokiness
u0RE_zUa3x4,544399,545839,i like it it's almost like a jerky how
u0RE_zUa3x4,545839,547360,long can you save this for a few days
u0RE_zUa3x4,547360,548959,you can put it in this
u0RE_zUa3x4,548959,551120,for some days in many rural areas like
u0RE_zUa3x4,551120,552959,this hanging and smoking is the most
u0RE_zUa3x4,552959,554720,effective way to preserve freshly
u0RE_zUa3x4,554720,556640,butchered meat hanging food here in this
u0RE_zUa3x4,556640,558320,part of africa scares me because i even
u0RE_zUa3x4,558320,560880,saw baboons in the city
u0RE_zUa3x4,560880,562800,do baboons ever come here they do and do
u0RE_zUa3x4,562800,566080,they ever attack your village no no

u0RE_zUa3x4,568160,570959,they've got a role in our society don't
u0RE_zUa3x4,570959,574080,give wild animals food which is eaten by
u0RE_zUa3x4,574080,576000,human beings they change their behavior
u0RE_zUa3x4,576000,577839,but if we live in harmony we talk to
u0RE_zUa3x4,577839,579680,them they move away really you can see
u0RE_zUa3x4,579680,582080,lions they come to you pretend as if
u0RE_zUa3x4,582080,584000,you've got a lot of energy approach them
u0RE_zUa3x4,584000,586080,don't fear they can feel that you fear
u0RE_zUa3x4,586080,587680,enter your heart they run away but if
u0RE_zUa3x4,587680,590160,you attack they fight you so no animal
u0RE_zUa3x4,590160,593839,is dangerous is us human being
u0RE_zUa3x4,595839,598160,during mpc's lifetime he's experienced a
u0RE_zUa3x4,598160,600240,transition from game beat to pasture
u0RE_zUa3x4,600240,604720,animals and even these
u0RE_zUa3x4,604720,606640,rabbits are prized for their lean meat
u0RE_zUa3x4,606640,610240,but just as much for their fur holy cow
u0RE_zUa3x4,610240,612800,this is a rabbit skin blanket made from

u0RE_zUa3x4,640079,641440,that the rabbit is one of the most
u0RE_zUa3x4,641440,642880,nutritious animals they have they said
u0RE_zUa3x4,642880,644560,more nutritious than chicken more than
u0RE_zUa3x4,644560,646240,beef and i think possibly even more than
u0RE_zUa3x4,646240,647839,goat i'm gonna try this part right here

u0RE_zUa3x4,651600,653120,looks like a wood tick that sucked on a

u0RE_zUa3x4,687360,688880,guessing the juiciest part was that
u0RE_zUa3x4,688880,691360,kidney will try out
u0RE_zUa3x4,691360,693279,a bit firm but not bad at all it's quite
u0RE_zUa3x4,693279,695200,delicious it's not really dry you think
u0RE_zUa3x4,695200,696800,it'd be a lot more dry for being just a
u0RE_zUa3x4,696800,698800,lean rabbit it's a little chewy man i'm
u0RE_zUa3x4,698800,700480,falling in love with the smokiness of it
u0RE_zUa3x4,700480,701920,and all my times coming to africa this
u0RE_zUa3x4,701920,703680,is one of my most unique experiences so

u0RE_zUa3x4,705040,706640,giving you a mid-video update it's kind
u0RE_zUa3x4,706640,708480,of heartbreaking when you realize and
u0RE_zUa3x4,708480,710000,see and experience how beautiful the
u0RE_zUa3x4,710000,711680,traditions are here and you know that
u0RE_zUa3x4,711680,713440,what you see today is still a diluted
u0RE_zUa3x4,713440,715920,version of what once was right now in bc
u0RE_zUa3x4,715920,717440,the family they're finishing up the goat
u0RE_zUa3x4,717440,720240,the real main meal is about to begin so
u0RE_zUa3x4,720240,722959,a very good one
u0RE_zUa3x4,724160,726079,like many tribes around africa some of
u0RE_zUa3x4,726079,728160,the sacrificed animal parts are strictly
u0RE_zUa3x4,728160,730160,allocated to men what we eat earlier
u0RE_zUa3x4,730160,731839,that's for men and others to women
u0RE_zUa3x4,731839,734000,depressed or short-lived cultural is for
u0RE_zUa3x4,734000,736160,women for dinner today we've got sorghum
u0RE_zUa3x4,736160,738480,zaza african cabbage and something known
u0RE_zUa3x4,738480,741040,as zenyenze more on that so i've got
u0RE_zUa3x4,741040,742839,some of the african
u0RE_zUa3x4,742839,745440,cabbage oh yeah that's so fresh it's a
u0RE_zUa3x4,745440,746639,little bit bigger do you put bile in
u0RE_zUa3x4,746639,748240,this nothing okay oh so this is
u0RE_zUa3x4,748240,749760,something i've never seen before this is
u0RE_zUa3x4,749760,751680,a piece of goat tripe wrapped tight with
u0RE_zUa3x4,751680,754079,intestines
u0RE_zUa3x4,754079,756000,the ingredients or should i say the
u0RE_zUa3x4,756000,757760,goat's stomach and intestines are
u0RE_zUa3x4,757760,759519,thoroughly cleaned and then cut down to
u0RE_zUa3x4,759519,761770,size
u0RE_zUa3x4,761770,763680,[Music]
u0RE_zUa3x4,763680,765200,each piece of tripe is wrapped with
u0RE_zUa3x4,765200,767040,intestine forming an elongated
u0RE_zUa3x4,767040,770079,sausage-like shape
u0RE_zUa3x4,771600,773680,now boil these works of art with salt
u0RE_zUa3x4,773680,775440,until they reach the desired level of
u0RE_zUa3x4,775440,776060,tenderness
u0RE_zUa3x4,776060,778800,[Music]
u0RE_zUa3x4,778800,780320,that's so cool but it looks pretty
u0RE_zUa3x4,780320,781839,gnarly too
u0RE_zUa3x4,781839,785360,oh my god like a perfume or a field of
u0RE_zUa3x4,785360,788560,daisies that's good food idea smells so
u0RE_zUa3x4,788560,790800,good
u0RE_zUa3x4,791330,792380,[Applause]
u0RE_zUa3x4,792380,794240,[Music]
u0RE_zUa3x4,794240,795920,uh-huh
u0RE_zUa3x4,795920,797360,okay
u0RE_zUa3x4,797360,799040,the taste is better than the smell can i
u0RE_zUa3x4,799040,801040,say that it's better than the smell
u0RE_zUa3x4,801040,802480,i love the texture it's like squishy
u0RE_zUa3x4,802480,804240,squeaky like some overcooked halamari
u0RE_zUa3x4,804240,805760,i've mixed the sausage with it to dilute
u0RE_zUa3x4,805760,807440,the flavor a little bit
u0RE_zUa3x4,807440,809200,what's your favorite part
u0RE_zUa3x4,809200,810720,right here i gotta say the more i take
u0RE_zUa3x4,810720,812240,bites the more i like it it smells of
u0RE_zUa3x4,812240,813760,gastric acid but when you're eating it
u0RE_zUa3x4,813760,815040,it's not really bitter i'm just kind of
u0RE_zUa3x4,815040,817279,savory what do you think
u0RE_zUa3x4,817279,818320,too much i like that
u0RE_zUa3x4,818320,820959,[Laughter]
u0RE_zUa3x4,820959,822959,as you may have noticed men and women
u0RE_zUa3x4,822959,825040,tend to sit and eat separately women can
u0RE_zUa3x4,825040,826880,talk about women's stuff and guys can
u0RE_zUa3x4,826880,829040,talk about guy stuff that's what in pc
u0RE_zUa3x4,829040,830480,says
u0RE_zUa3x4,830480,832079,so what are some of the main issues you
u0RE_zUa3x4,832079,834000,know it's hard to tell women that i have
u0RE_zUa3x4,834000,836000,lost of lipitor i have one loss of
u0RE_zUa3x4,836000,838079,lipids oh yeah no one wants to admit
u0RE_zUa3x4,838079,840160,that but we can discuss it if we were
u0RE_zUa3x4,840160,841920,men together instead of discussing my
u0RE_zUa3x4,841920,843920,own libido status i figure it's better
u0RE_zUa3x4,843920,845839,to move on to the next topic the goat
u0RE_zUa3x4,845839,848079,leg
u0RE_zUa3x4,848320,850480,grilled over fire until it's well done
u0RE_zUa3x4,850480,852270,and seasoned with a bit of salt
u0RE_zUa3x4,852270,854240,[Music]
u0RE_zUa3x4,854240,857839,oh yeah i can't wait to try this out

u0RE_zUa3x4,866560,868800,the inside almost no gaming goat flavor
u0RE_zUa3x4,868800,870240,at all it's like the opposite of the
u0RE_zUa3x4,870240,871519,intestines in the stomach it's so
u0RE_zUa3x4,871519,873279,different it's so different but now it's
u0RE_zUa3x4,873279,875279,just better because they've tested that
u0RE_zUa3x4,875279,876399,one
u0RE_zUa3x4,876399,878320,that is part of the flavoring that makes
