IRPCbwPBO6I,254239,255200,down
IRPCbwPBO6I,255200,257759,now the payoff again swung on popped him
IRPCbwPBO6I,257759,260400,up foul maybe a play for clement near
IRPCbwPBO6I,260400,263360,the stands he leaps makes the catch just
IRPCbwPBO6I,263360,265199,in front of the sidewall

IRPCbwPBO6I,297840,300560,this has been the guardian's
IRPCbwPBO6I,300560,304160,best hitter with men in scoring position
IRPCbwPBO6I,304160,308639,batting 4 18. now the 1-2
IRPCbwPBO6I,308639,312240,and it hit him on the arm or in the hand
IRPCbwPBO6I,312240,315840,area andre simenes down in the count is
IRPCbwPBO6I,315840,318560,hit by the pitch trailing minnesota one
IRPCbwPBO6I,318560,321199,to nothing ernie clement can change all
IRPCbwPBO6I,321199,324400,that minnesota keeps the corner men up
IRPCbwPBO6I,324400,326639,the middle infielders double play depth
IRPCbwPBO6I,326639,329199,and the jam right now needs an out three
IRPCbwPBO6I,329199,331440,on twins by one the one two pitch ground
IRPCbwPBO6I,331440,333440,ball right side gloved by miranda he
IRPCbwPBO6I,333440,335600,comes home for one and no throw back to
IRPCbwPBO6I,335600,338080,first and the twins get the lead man
IRPCbwPBO6I,338080,339919,bases stay loaded
IRPCbwPBO6I,339919,341919,but now double play ball and joe smith
IRPCbwPBO6I,341919,343440,is out of the inning
IRPCbwPBO6I,343440,344960,and the yo one gromball the third

IRPCbwPBO6I,346960,348880,comes home and they still get the lead
IRPCbwPBO6I,348880,349840,man
IRPCbwPBO6I,349840,352880,reyes is out number two
IRPCbwPBO6I,352880,355440,if it was any other runner this is a tie
IRPCbwPBO6I,355440,357199,game when you're running home you think
IRPCbwPBO6I,357199,358800,they're going to turn the double play he
IRPCbwPBO6I,358800,360560,dropped the ball they were going to and
IRPCbwPBO6I,360560,362240,his only play was to come home and cut
IRPCbwPBO6I,362240,363440,off the run
IRPCbwPBO6I,363440,365440,and reyes didn't understand that's what
IRPCbwPBO6I,365440,367520,was going on base is still loaded for
IRPCbwPBO6I,367520,370160,miles straw well there will probably be
IRPCbwPBO6I,370160,372240,another pitch of the game before we
IRPCbwPBO6I,372240,374880,finish this up but as of this point is
IRPCbwPBO6I,374880,376639,the pitch of the game right here to
IRPCbwPBO6I,376639,378400,right field

IRPCbwPBO6I,402080,405520,out for out number one
IRPCbwPBO6I,406000,409840,and they're gonna make the change
IRPCbwPBO6I,410080,412880,to run with three strikeouts
IRPCbwPBO6I,412880,415039,to get four outs
IRPCbwPBO6I,415039,416960,and then last field bar to get the last
IRPCbwPBO6I,416960,418479,two
