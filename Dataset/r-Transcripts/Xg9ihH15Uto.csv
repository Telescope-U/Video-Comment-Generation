Xg9ihH15Uto,33360,34480,i want to point out that i've been
Xg9ihH15Uto,34480,36320,working independently for about a decade
Xg9ihH15Uto,36320,38160,so to make this video i reached out to a
Xg9ihH15Uto,38160,40000,few different hiring managers both at
Xg9ihH15Uto,40000,42160,big mega corporations and startups to
Xg9ihH15Uto,42160,43680,figure out what the decision makers are
Xg9ihH15Uto,43680,45120,actually looking for especially when
Xg9ihH15Uto,45120,47039,hiring a self-taught programmer with no
Xg9ihH15Uto,47039,49200,prior experience as of today the job
Xg9ihH15Uto,49200,51039,market is likely stronger than it's ever
Xg9ihH15Uto,51039,52719,been before there's all kinds of stories
Xg9ihH15Uto,52719,54160,of people quitting their jobs in the
Xg9ihH15Uto,54160,56160,great resignation only to land a much
Xg9ihH15Uto,56160,57600,higher paying job because there's a
Xg9ihH15Uto,57600,59280,massive shortage of talent that spans
Xg9ihH15Uto,59280,61280,across many industries it's really weird
Xg9ihH15Uto,61280,62640,and i've never seen anything like this
Xg9ihH15Uto,62640,64080,before it's great if you're looking for
Xg9ihH15Uto,64080,65760,a new job but there may be some warning
Xg9ihH15Uto,65760,67520,signs on the horizon many of the top
Xg9ihH15Uto,67520,69200,publicly traded tech companies have seen
Xg9ihH15Uto,69200,71040,their stock prices quietly crash over
Xg9ihH15Uto,71040,72479,the last few months companies like
Xg9ihH15Uto,72479,74799,twilio and cloudflare are down 50 from
Xg9ihH15Uto,74799,76560,their highs of last year a lot of big
Xg9ihH15Uto,76560,78240,money is moving out of profitless tech
Xg9ihH15Uto,78240,79840,companies and generally that's not a
Xg9ihH15Uto,79840,82080,good sign for tech jobs but that's just
Xg9ihH15Uto,82080,83840,a short-term concern over the long term
Xg9ihH15Uto,83840,85520,i think tech is one of the safest and
Xg9ihH15Uto,85520,87360,best places you could possibly work the
Xg9ihH15Uto,87360,88479,first thing you'll need is the right
Xg9ihH15Uto,88479,90240,attitude getting a high paying job in
Xg9ihH15Uto,90240,92000,tech is hard there's a lot of overly
Xg9ihH15Uto,92000,93920,optimistic marketing bs out there that
Xg9ihH15Uto,93920,95360,might make you think you just go to a
Xg9ihH15Uto,95360,96720,boot camp for a few weeks and
Xg9ihH15Uto,96720,97920,immediately after you're making a
Xg9ihH15Uto,97920,99439,hundred thousand dollars there are some
Xg9ihH15Uto,99439,101200,success stories that go like that but
Xg9ihH15Uto,101200,102720,for the most part it's a very difficult
Xg9ihH15Uto,102720,104560,grind that requires you to be highly
Xg9ihH15Uto,104560,106720,motivated and highly persistent to put
Xg9ihH15Uto,106720,108799,things in perspective lambda school who
Xg9ihH15Uto,108799,110720,recently changed its name to the bloom
Xg9ihH15Uto,110720,112560,institute of technology i wonder why
Xg9ihH15Uto,112560,115360,they did that charges 22 000 in tuition
Xg9ihH15Uto,115360,117840,but guarantees a job earning 50 000
Xg9ihH15Uto,117840,119280,after you graduate that's about what a
Xg9ihH15Uto,119280,121200,taco bell manager makes what they teach
Xg9ihH15Uto,121200,122640,you is the same stuff you can learn here
Xg9ihH15Uto,122640,124399,on youtube but they support you by
Xg9ihH15Uto,124399,125920,making you hirable the same thing i'm
Xg9ihH15Uto,125920,127520,trying to teach you on youtube for free
Xg9ihH15Uto,127520,129200,right now now if you don't get a job
Xg9ihH15Uto,129200,132000,after the program they will refund 110
Xg9ihH15Uto,132000,133840,of the tuition however in order to
Xg9ihH15Uto,133840,135360,qualify for that you'll need to spend a
Xg9ihH15Uto,135360,137520,year applying to 10 jobs per week
Xg9ihH15Uto,137520,139040,reaching out to 10 professionals for
Xg9ihH15Uto,139040,140640,networking and making at least five
Xg9ihH15Uto,140640,142319,github contributions that means you'll
Xg9ihH15Uto,142319,144879,need to apply to at least 520 jobs and
Xg9ihH15Uto,144879,146959,be rejected from every single one they
Xg9ihH15Uto,146959,148239,know it's a grind and you should have
Xg9ihH15Uto,148239,149760,the same mindset when going into it
Xg9ihH15Uto,149760,151440,yourself independently but on the bright
Xg9ihH15Uto,151440,153280,side it's definitely achievable if you
Xg9ihH15Uto,153280,154879,work hard at it and accept the fact that
Xg9ihH15Uto,154879,156160,you're probably going to have to face a
Xg9ihH15Uto,156160,157840,lot of rejection before you finally do
Xg9ihH15Uto,157840,159599,land a job i'd recommend subscribing to
Xg9ihH15Uto,159599,161360,the dorian develops youtube channel who
Xg9ihH15Uto,161360,163280,has a recent video about his story about
Xg9ihH15Uto,163280,164800,landing a job as a self-taught
Xg9ihH15Uto,164800,166640,programmer it took him about a year now
Xg9ihH15Uto,166640,168400,let's move on to strategy 2. live in the
Xg9ihH15Uto,168400,170239,united states specifically in new york
Xg9ihH15Uto,170239,172959,city the bay area or seattle in the 2021
Xg9ihH15Uto,172959,174959,stack overflow survey the median salary
Xg9ihH15Uto,174959,177440,for engineers is well below 100k in the
Xg9ihH15Uto,177440,179040,united states though it jumps up to
Xg9ihH15Uto,179040,181680,about 130k a few weeks ago i posted a
Xg9ihH15Uto,181680,183760,poll on this channel that has a 150 000
Xg9ihH15Uto,183760,186080,responses yet only 11 percent are making
Xg9ihH15Uto,186080,188159,more than 100k sadly where you live
Xg9ihH15Uto,188159,189680,really does make a big difference so
Xg9ihH15Uto,189680,191200,keep your expectations in line with your
Xg9ihH15Uto,191200,193120,region now the key to getting hired is
Xg9ihH15Uto,193120,194800,to make yourself valuable think of it
Xg9ihH15Uto,194800,196319,from the eyes of the employer why would
Xg9ihH15Uto,196319,197840,they actually want to hire you what
Xg9ihH15Uto,197840,199280,value would you add to the team to the
Xg9ihH15Uto,199280,201519,product to the company etc most tech
Xg9ihH15Uto,201519,203040,companies don't actually make any money
Xg9ihH15Uto,203040,204640,but the general idea of employment is
Xg9ihH15Uto,204640,206239,that the employer can make a profit off
Xg9ihH15Uto,206239,208000,of your labor the question becomes how
Xg9ihH15Uto,208000,209840,do we make you desirable to these
Xg9ihH15Uto,209840,211360,potential employers there are many
Xg9ihH15Uto,211360,213120,things you can start doing today in
Xg9ihH15Uto,213120,214799,strategy three we'll look at twitter
Xg9ihH15Uto,214799,216159,there's a whole subculture out there
Xg9ihH15Uto,216159,217680,called tech twitter and i've seen tons
Xg9ihH15Uto,217680,219519,of people land a job simply by adding
Xg9ihH15Uto,219519,221280,value to this tech twitter community
Xg9ihH15Uto,221280,222879,there's a pretty simple formula for
Xg9ihH15Uto,222879,224799,growing a twitter account to get started
Xg9ihH15Uto,224799,226319,follow the influential people that you
Xg9ihH15Uto,226319,227760,want to be hired by then create a
Xg9ihH15Uto,227760,229440,profile that's totally transparent that
Xg9ihH15Uto,229440,231120,you're on a journey to land your first
Xg9ihH15Uto,231120,232480,job in tech then you can start
Xg9ihH15Uto,232480,234159,responding to other people's tweets with
Xg9ihH15Uto,234159,235840,encouragement and positivity people will
Xg9ihH15Uto,235840,237840,think hey bob's a really nice guy i want
Xg9ihH15Uto,237840,239040,to see him succeed and i'm going to
Xg9ihH15Uto,239040,240720,follow him to watch it happen from there
Xg9ihH15Uto,240720,242000,you need to hack the out of the
Xg9ihH15Uto,242000,243439,twitter algorithm whenever you learn
Xg9ihH15Uto,243439,245120,something new post a thread about it if
Xg9ihH15Uto,245120,246720,you have any good code tips use carbon
Xg9ihH15Uto,246720,248319,to create a snippet and post it with a
Xg9ihH15Uto,248319,249840,bunch of emojis you'll also want to
Xg9ihH15Uto,249840,251599,create lists with resources for
Xg9ihH15Uto,251599,252959,developers like the best youtube
Xg9ihH15Uto,252959,254400,channels to learn programming and make
Xg9ihH15Uto,254400,256400,sure you put fireship as number one it
Xg9ihH15Uto,256400,258000,also helps to tweet out open-ended
Xg9ihH15Uto,258000,259519,questions and to come up with your own
Xg9ihH15Uto,259519,261120,memes the majority of my twitter growth
Xg9ihH15Uto,261120,262720,has been the result of memes if you're
Xg9ihH15Uto,262720,264080,serious you should be tweeting every
Xg9ihH15Uto,264080,266000,single day like multiple times per day
Xg9ihH15Uto,266000,267759,one account i followed tweets an average
Xg9ihH15Uto,267759,269840,of 37 times per day which generates an
Xg9ihH15Uto,269840,272560,average of 277 new followers per day you
Xg9ihH15Uto,272560,274080,don't need to be that prolific but just
Xg9ihH15Uto,274080,276000,try to be consistent more importantly
Xg9ihH15Uto,276000,277680,though don't screw things up by saying
Xg9ihH15Uto,277680,279199,something
Xg9ihH15Uto,279199,281040,like if you tweet out man my code is
Xg9ihH15Uto,281040,282720,being right now somebody with a
Xg9ihH15Uto,282720,284000,lot of followers who thinks they're a
Xg9ihH15Uto,284000,285360,lot more important than they really are
Xg9ihH15Uto,285360,286720,might call you out and then everybody
Xg9ihH15Uto,286720,288400,will dog pile on you and at that point
Xg9ihH15Uto,288400,290000,your journey into tech will be over
Xg9ihH15Uto,290000,291520,before it started now that you know how
Xg9ihH15Uto,291520,293360,twitter works let's move into strategy
Xg9ihH15Uto,293360,295040,four linkedin there are tons of
Xg9ihH15Uto,295040,296800,recruiters on linkedin who can help you
Xg9ihH15Uto,296800,299040,get a job in tech but remember bob
Xg9ihH15Uto,299040,300880,doesn't have any connections in tech yet
Xg9ihH15Uto,300880,302240,so how does he even get started with
Xg9ihH15Uto,302240,303840,linkedin well the first thing you can do
Xg9ihH15Uto,303840,305759,is find people you look up to and send
Xg9ihH15Uto,305759,307039,them a message that you're looking to
Xg9ihH15Uto,307039,308400,get into tech and that you would like to
Xg9ihH15Uto,308400,310080,connect most humans are actually pretty
Xg9ihH15Uto,310080,311360,nice and will connect with you no
Xg9ihH15Uto,311360,313039,problem feel free to make me your first
Xg9ihH15Uto,313039,314720,connection if you'd like also join
Xg9ihH15Uto,314720,316080,groups for the different technologies
Xg9ihH15Uto,316080,317199,that you're interested in and
Xg9ihH15Uto,317199,318960,participate in them if possible you can
Xg9ihH15Uto,318960,320479,also build your network by posting
Xg9ihH15Uto,320479,322240,content you can actually just reuse the
Xg9ihH15Uto,322240,323919,content you've been using for threads on
Xg9ihH15Uto,323919,326000,twitter and post it to linkedin now that
Xg9ihH15Uto,326000,327600,you have your linkedin network going we
Xg9ihH15Uto,327600,329199,can talk about the most important social
Xg9ihH15Uto,329199,330960,site in github as a self-taught
Xg9ihH15Uto,330960,332720,programmer it's very important that you
Xg9ihH15Uto,332720,334240,at least have something going on in your
Xg9ihH15Uto,334240,335919,github in a perfect world you have
Xg9ihH15Uto,335919,337759,commits every single day not only to
Xg9ihH15Uto,337759,339759,your own project but to many other open
Xg9ihH15Uto,339759,341360,source projects out there that's not
Xg9ihH15Uto,341360,343039,very realistic but it's important to be
Xg9ihH15Uto,343039,344880,consistent and that's exactly why lambda
Xg9ihH15Uto,344880,347039,school or bloom institute of technology
Xg9ihH15Uto,347039,348479,requires that you make five github
Xg9ihH15Uto,348479,350639,contributions per week to an employer it
Xg9ihH15Uto,350639,352000,shows that you're capable of writing
Xg9ihH15Uto,352000,353680,code every day which tends to be a
Xg9ihH15Uto,353680,355039,pretty important part of the job if
Xg9ihH15Uto,355039,356400,you're just getting started one of the
Xg9ihH15Uto,356400,358319,easiest ways to contribute is to look
Xg9ihH15Uto,358319,360720,for typos in the documentation fireship
Xg9ihH15Uto,360720,362720,io for example is open source and you
Xg9ihH15Uto,362720,364720,can find all kinds of typos in it if you
Xg9ihH15Uto,364720,366639,fix it and send a pull request you can
Xg9ihH15Uto,366639,368080,easily add that contribution to your
Xg9ihH15Uto,368080,369759,timeline as you start using more open
Xg9ihH15Uto,369759,371759,source libraries don't be afraid to open
Xg9ihH15Uto,371759,373440,issues when you find problems and if you
Xg9ihH15Uto,373440,375440,want to contribute look for issues that
Xg9ihH15Uto,375440,377520,are tagged with good first issue it is
Xg9ihH15Uto,377520,378720,true that you're kind of working for
Xg9ihH15Uto,378720,380479,free here but doing so will make your
Xg9ihH15Uto,380479,382319,github profile much stronger and it's
Xg9ihH15Uto,382319,384160,just great experience as a developer in
Xg9ihH15Uto,384160,385680,fact if you don't have fun doing this
Xg9ihH15Uto,385680,387360,kind of stuff then maybe a career as a
Xg9ihH15Uto,387360,388960,software engineer isn't the best career
Xg9ihH15Uto,388960,390880,path now that your github is impressive
Xg9ihH15Uto,390880,393120,it's time to build a personal project
Xg9ihH15Uto,393120,394800,because bob is a developer that nobody
Xg9ihH15Uto,394800,396479,knows he needs to show employers that he
Xg9ihH15Uto,396479,397759,can actually build something that's
Xg9ihH15Uto,397759,399600,non-trivial ideally something that will
Xg9ihH15Uto,399600,401120,blow people's minds that cannot be
Xg9ihH15Uto,401120,403120,ignored you are much better off having
Xg9ihH15Uto,403120,405440,one really awesome app than 10 mediocre
Xg9ihH15Uto,405440,406960,apps quality is much better than
Xg9ihH15Uto,406960,408880,quantity when it comes to your portfolio
Xg9ihH15Uto,408880,410880,the engineering manager who hires you is
Xg9ihH15Uto,410880,412479,likely a much better programmer than you
Xg9ihH15Uto,412479,413759,are they'll be able to tell if your
Xg9ihH15Uto,413759,415360,portfolio is filled with a bunch of
Xg9ihH15Uto,415360,417199,cookie cutter projects recreated from
Xg9ihH15Uto,417199,418960,tutorials on youtube give yourself three
Xg9ihH15Uto,418960,420639,to six months to build something that is
Xg9ihH15Uto,420639,422319,truly impressive one example is the
Xg9ihH15Uto,422319,425199,portfolio of bruno simon he used 3js to
Xg9ihH15Uto,425199,427120,build an interactive 3d landscape to
Xg9ihH15Uto,427120,428880,showcase his work the reaction from
Xg9ihH15Uto,428880,430240,other developers should be something
Xg9ihH15Uto,430240,432000,like wow that would not be an easy app
Xg9ihH15Uto,432000,433680,to pull off it's so good that i want to
Xg9ihH15Uto,433680,435520,include it in my youtube video building
Xg9ihH15Uto,435520,437039,an app is one thing but the next
Xg9ihH15Uto,437039,439360,strategy is to build this app in public
Xg9ihH15Uto,439360,440800,what i mean by that is you should
Xg9ihH15Uto,440800,442560,transparently document the entire
Xg9ihH15Uto,442560,444240,process while you spend the next few
Xg9ihH15Uto,444240,445759,months building something awesome the
Xg9ihH15Uto,445759,447280,most common way to do that is by
Xg9ihH15Uto,447280,449120,blogging there are many sites out there
Xg9ihH15Uto,449120,451520,like dev2 and medium to create your own
Xg9ihH15Uto,451520,453599,blog easily but i would highly recommend
Xg9ihH15Uto,453599,455759,blogging on your own custom built site
Xg9ihH15Uto,455759,458080,in my opinion a custom site expresses
Xg9ihH15Uto,458080,459759,more passion about the craft of web
Xg9ihH15Uto,459759,461520,development in addition to blogging
Xg9ihH15Uto,461520,463039,you'll also want to be documenting the
Xg9ihH15Uto,463039,464879,process on linkedin and twitter and you
Xg9ihH15Uto,464879,466319,may even consider starting your own
Xg9ihH15Uto,466319,468000,youtube channel building in public is
Xg9ihH15Uto,468000,469759,extremely powerful because it creates a
Xg9ihH15Uto,469759,471360,feedback loop you don't otherwise get
Xg9ihH15Uto,471360,472639,when you're just working alone in your
Xg9ihH15Uto,472639,474319,mom's basement there's a whole community
Xg9ihH15Uto,474319,476080,of startups who are building in public
Xg9ihH15Uto,476080,477440,you should give them feedback on their
Xg9ihH15Uto,477440,478879,products and in return they'll do the
Xg9ihH15Uto,478879,481120,same to make your project better in fact
Xg9ihH15Uto,481120,482720,you might even consider monetizing your
Xg9ihH15Uto,482720,484160,project because if you build something
Xg9ihH15Uto,484160,485360,really good you might end up
Xg9ihH15Uto,485360,487280,accidentally creating a job for yourself
Xg9ihH15Uto,487280,488960,one example of a success story is
Xg9ihH15Uto,488960,490960,superhuman an email application that
Xg9ihH15Uto,490960,492560,charges thirty dollars per month that
Xg9ihH15Uto,492560,494400,was built in public they got tons of
Xg9ihH15Uto,494400,495919,great feedback from potential customers
Xg9ihH15Uto,495919,497440,while building the product and you can
Xg9ihH15Uto,497440,498720,do the same thing with your personal
Xg9ihH15Uto,498720,500800,brand while looking for a job now we can
Xg9ihH15Uto,500800,502479,move into strategy eight real life
Xg9ihH15Uto,502479,504080,networking where you actually have to
Xg9ihH15Uto,504080,505919,like look at people's faces and say
Xg9ihH15Uto,505919,507599,words to them and stuff as an introvert
Xg9ihH15Uto,507599,509280,this has never come easy for me but what
Xg9ihH15Uto,509280,510800,i can tell you is that some of the best
Xg9ihH15Uto,510800,512880,business contacts i have come from real
Xg9ihH15Uto,512880,515200,life interactions believe it or not zoom
Xg9ihH15Uto,515200,516800,or the metaverse doesn't replace the
Xg9ihH15Uto,516800,519039,magic of face-to-face human interaction
Xg9ihH15Uto,519039,522240,i'm here live that's not i'm not a cat
Xg9ihH15Uto,522240,523919,the pandemic has ruined this in a lot of
Xg9ihH15Uto,523919,525839,ways but traditionally the best way to
Xg9ihH15Uto,525839,527760,meet people locally is through meetups
Xg9ihH15Uto,527760,529360,all you have to do is find your local
Xg9ihH15Uto,529360,530880,programming meetup show up there and eat
Xg9ihH15Uto,530880,532399,some free pizza and maybe you'll meet
Xg9ihH15Uto,532399,533680,someone important that can help you down
Xg9ihH15Uto,533680,535120,the road now the other thing i'd
Xg9ihH15Uto,535120,537120,recommend is attending conferences it's
Xg9ihH15Uto,537120,538880,more expensive but a lot of hiring
Xg9ihH15Uto,538880,540560,managers and employees attend these
Xg9ihH15Uto,540560,541920,things and they're often looking for
Xg9ihH15Uto,541920,543600,people to hire who are interested in
Xg9ihH15Uto,543600,545120,their tech stack learning the basic
Xg9ihH15Uto,545120,546959,skill of introducing yourself and making
Xg9ihH15Uto,546959,548880,small talk can go a really long way when
Xg9ihH15Uto,548880,550480,it comes to landing a job you just have
Xg9ihH15Uto,550480,551920,to get in a room with the right people
Xg9ihH15Uto,551920,553680,they say it's not what you know but who
Xg9ihH15Uto,553680,555360,you know speaking of which another
Xg9ihH15Uto,555360,557519,powerful strategy is to get a mentor
Xg9ihH15Uto,557519,559200,which is much easier to do when you make
Xg9ihH15Uto,559200,560959,a real-life connection it might be a
Xg9ihH15Uto,560959,562880,person with 20 years of experience or a
Xg9ihH15Uto,562880,564399,person that's just one step ahead of you
Xg9ihH15Uto,564399,566080,who just landed their first job it's
Xg9ihH15Uto,566080,567920,extremely valuable to have a person in
Xg9ihH15Uto,567920,569519,the industry who you can have an honest
Xg9ihH15Uto,569519,571040,conversation with you're likely making
Xg9ihH15Uto,571040,572399,many mistakes that you don't even
Xg9ihH15Uto,572399,574720,realize having a mentor who can validate
Xg9ihH15Uto,574720,576320,or criticize the things you're doing is
Xg9ihH15Uto,576320,577839,much faster than actually making those
Xg9ihH15Uto,577839,579440,mistakes and learning from them one by
Xg9ihH15Uto,579440,580959,one most boot camps will give you a
Xg9ihH15Uto,580959,582480,mentor and that's one of the main things
Xg9ihH15Uto,582480,584320,you pay them for but you'd be surprised
Xg9ihH15Uto,584320,585760,at how many people out there will mentor
Xg9ihH15Uto,585760,587279,you for free because at one point they
Xg9ihH15Uto,587279,588800,were in your shoes and people are more
Xg9ihH15Uto,588800,590480,altruistic than you might think and that
Xg9ihH15Uto,590480,592560,brings me to strategy number 10 be a
Xg9ihH15Uto,592560,594480,good fit as you start applying for jobs
Xg9ihH15Uto,594480,595920,you'll mostly hear crickets but if
Xg9ihH15Uto,595920,597120,you're lucky you'll get a phone
Xg9ihH15Uto,597120,598800,interview and then be rejected the next
Xg9ihH15Uto,598800,600720,day the natural reaction here is to be
Xg9ihH15Uto,600720,602480,sad and to feel worthless or you might
Xg9ihH15Uto,602480,604079,be angry at the company or think the
Xg9ihH15Uto,604079,605839,interviewer treated you unfairly but the
Xg9ihH15Uto,605839,607839,reality is that rejection is just the
Xg9ihH15Uto,607839,609600,story you tell yourself the best way to
Xg9ihH15Uto,609600,611360,respond to it is accept it as part of
Xg9ihH15Uto,611360,613200,life and selfishly see what you can gain
Xg9ihH15Uto,613200,614959,from it maybe ask for feedback or
Xg9ihH15Uto,614959,616880,guidance to help you do better next time
Xg9ihH15Uto,616880,618160,what you'll notice about successful
Xg9ihH15Uto,618160,619839,people is that they're persistent they
Xg9ihH15Uto,619839,621680,fail over and over again without caring
Xg9ihH15Uto,621680,623600,until finally something works now the
Xg9ihH15Uto,623600,624959,other thing to keep in mind is that a
Xg9ihH15Uto,624959,626640,company won't hire you based on your
Xg9ihH15Uto,626640,628240,technical skill alone i mean it
Xg9ihH15Uto,628240,629920,definitely helps but they also want to
Xg9ihH15Uto,629920,631279,make sure that you fit into their
Xg9ihH15Uto,631279,633120,company culture as a candidate they want
Xg9ihH15Uto,633120,634959,you to embrace their core values and
Xg9ihH15Uto,634959,636160,make sure that you'll fit into their
Xg9ihH15Uto,636160,638079,management leadership style before you
Xg9ihH15Uto,638079,639519,interview you should understand the
Xg9ihH15Uto,639519,641200,company's core values and look at their
Xg9ihH15Uto,641200,642959,social media profiles to see what kind
Xg9ihH15Uto,642959,644320,of messaging they're putting out there
Xg9ihH15Uto,644320,645680,make sure you align with their values
Xg9ihH15Uto,645680,646880,unless you want to hate your job for the
Xg9ihH15Uto,646880,648640,next 10 years and then try to mold
Xg9ihH15Uto,648640,650000,yourself into the candidate that they're
Xg9ihH15Uto,650000,651839,looking for i'd recommend also checking
Xg9ihH15Uto,651839,653600,out danny thompson's youtube channel who
Xg9ihH15Uto,653600,655200,has a short video that explains this
Xg9ihH15Uto,655200,657200,really well in detail and with that you
Xg9ihH15Uto,657200,658880,have 10 strategies that can help you
Xg9ihH15Uto,658880,660399,land a job you don't need to use all of
Xg9ihH15Uto,660399,662160,these but each one can get you a little
Xg9ihH15Uto,662160,664320,bit closer to landing a six figure tech
Xg9ihH15Uto,664320,666000,job in addition you'll also need to
Xg9ihH15Uto,666000,667760,learn how to code and how to master the
Xg9ihH15Uto,667760,669519,technical interview but don't worry i
Xg9ihH15Uto,669519,671440,have upcoming videos on those topics as
Xg9ihH15Uto,671440,672880,well make sure you're subscribed so you
