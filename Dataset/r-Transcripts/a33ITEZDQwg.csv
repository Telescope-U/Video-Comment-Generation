a33ITEZDQwg,8720,10320,the problem with horror movies is that
a33ITEZDQwg,10320,12559,they can be too scary to watch
a33ITEZDQwg,12559,14400,some can't watch them because they get
a33ITEZDQwg,14400,16640,panic attacks due to anxiety disorders
a33ITEZDQwg,16640,18240,that affect tens of millions of
a33ITEZDQwg,18240,20480,americans this is a shame because some
a33ITEZDQwg,20480,21680,of these horror films have become
a33ITEZDQwg,21680,23519,staples of pop culture and the
a33ITEZDQwg,23519,25439,intenseness of these movies exclude
a33ITEZDQwg,25439,27760,people from enjoying these works so why
a33ITEZDQwg,27760,29199,not make a version of the film that's
a33ITEZDQwg,29199,31199,less scary so it can be accessible to
a33ITEZDQwg,31199,33280,more people and i don't mean making a
a33ITEZDQwg,33280,34960,censored version to reduce the rating
a33ITEZDQwg,34960,37680,for television
a33ITEZDQwg,38160,40160,i just mean modifying only the scary
a33ITEZDQwg,40160,42399,parts you could do this with some clever
a33ITEZDQwg,42399,44320,editing and we can call this version the
a33ITEZDQwg,44320,46079,thriller cut which would promise fewer
a33ITEZDQwg,46079,48480,nightmares and fewer anxiety attacks
a33ITEZDQwg,48480,50239,just tone down the spooky music and
a33ITEZDQwg,50239,52239,sudden sound effects shorten scenes that
a33ITEZDQwg,52239,54480,build up too much tension and cut or
a33ITEZDQwg,54480,57120,blur out the most disturbing imagery the
a33ITEZDQwg,57120,58879,intensity will be tuned to be more the
a33ITEZDQwg,58879,60559,level of a thriller film which is
a33ITEZDQwg,60559,62960,something many more people can enjoy
a33ITEZDQwg,62960,64960,it wouldn't be expensive to do and the
a33ITEZDQwg,64960,66799,original version of the movie will still
a33ITEZDQwg,66799,68640,exist so nothing will change for the
a33ITEZDQwg,68640,70799,viewers who prefer that there could be
a33ITEZDQwg,70799,72720,two versions you can choose from kind of
a33ITEZDQwg,72720,74720,like how there are dubbed and subtitled
a33ITEZDQwg,74720,77040,versions for foreign films
a33ITEZDQwg,77040,78880,this might seem like a facetious nathan
a33ITEZDQwg,78880,81280,for you proposal no one knows to ask for
a33ITEZDQwg,81280,83520,something that hasn't been invented yet
a33ITEZDQwg,83520,85600,but seriously why don't people demand
a33ITEZDQwg,85600,86400,this
a33ITEZDQwg,86400,88080,he seems like film lovers who can't
a33ITEZDQwg,88080,90159,watch horror films just choose to watch
a33ITEZDQwg,90159,92079,something else but they miss out on
a33ITEZDQwg,92079,94799,films like halloween the exorcist and
a33ITEZDQwg,94799,96960,the shining all films selected for
a33ITEZDQwg,96960,98640,preservation in the united states film
a33ITEZDQwg,98640,100320,registry for being culturally
a33ITEZDQwg,100320,102000,historically and aesthetically
a33ITEZDQwg,102000,103280,significant
a33ITEZDQwg,103280,105280,but perhaps this is why people don't
a33ITEZDQwg,105280,107439,demand a thriller cut for horror films
a33ITEZDQwg,107439,109200,they understand the film was intended to
a33ITEZDQwg,109200,111439,be this way by its creators and this
a33ITEZDQwg,111439,113520,intent is what makes the film unique and
a33ITEZDQwg,113520,116000,valuable in the first place they see it
a33ITEZDQwg,116000,117680,as art
a33ITEZDQwg,117680,119840,but what about video games
a33ITEZDQwg,119840,122000,in 2010 pulitzer prize-winning film
a33ITEZDQwg,122000,124079,critic roger ebert infamously wrote a
a33ITEZDQwg,124079,126320,blog post titled video games can never
a33ITEZDQwg,126320,129039,be art i immediately felt he must be
a33ITEZDQwg,129039,131760,wrong but i didn't know why i wasn't
a33ITEZDQwg,131760,134000,happy with dismissing him as a non-gamer
a33ITEZDQwg,134000,136239,who just doesn't get it so i looked at
a33ITEZDQwg,136239,137760,what he had to say
a33ITEZDQwg,137760,139440,ebert claims that even if there was an
a33ITEZDQwg,139440,141840,immersive game with no points or rules
a33ITEZDQwg,141840,143680,it would cease to be a game and become a
a33ITEZDQwg,143680,147440,representation of a story a novel a play
a33ITEZDQwg,147440,150319,dance a film those are things you cannot
a33ITEZDQwg,150319,152959,win you can only experience them this
a33ITEZDQwg,152959,154800,led me to imagine a hypothetical game
a33ITEZDQwg,154800,156400,called the matrix
a33ITEZDQwg,156400,157959,instead of being released as a film in
a33ITEZDQwg,157959,160400,1999 imagine it was released as a
a33ITEZDQwg,160400,163040,playstation 2 game instead you press any
a33ITEZDQwg,163040,164640,button to start the game which will
a33ITEZDQwg,164640,166560,proceed to playing the matrix film all
a33ITEZDQwg,166560,168640,the way up until morpheus offers neo the
a33ITEZDQwg,168640,170400,red or blue pill
a33ITEZDQwg,170400,172720,the screen pauses and from here if you
a33ITEZDQwg,172720,174800,press x you take the blue pill and
a33ITEZDQwg,174800,176480,remain stuck in the fake world of the
a33ITEZDQwg,176480,179760,matrix game over if you press circle you
a33ITEZDQwg,179760,182400,take the red pill and beat the game now
a33ITEZDQwg,182400,184560,you get to watch the ending which is the
a33ITEZDQwg,184560,186080,rest of the movie
a33ITEZDQwg,186080,188159,is this a game
a33ITEZDQwg,188159,190480,not much of one and ebert will be right
a33ITEZDQwg,190480,192239,in saying this is just a representation
a33ITEZDQwg,192239,193610,of a film
a33ITEZDQwg,193610,196800,[Music]
a33ITEZDQwg,196800,199360,in video games the stories cinematics
a33ITEZDQwg,199360,201920,animations music and other mediums we
a33ITEZDQwg,201920,203920,can more comfortably call art is what
a33ITEZDQwg,203920,206319,the game devs call the motif
a33ITEZDQwg,206319,207680,the rules and objects which are
a33ITEZDQwg,207680,210239,programmed are called the game mechanics
a33ITEZDQwg,210239,212879,combine the two and you get a video game
a33ITEZDQwg,212879,215120,story driven games like monkey island
a33ITEZDQwg,215120,217519,final fantasy my hypothetical matrix
a33ITEZDQwg,217519,219360,game and games where you ride a horse
a33ITEZDQwg,219360,221599,and hold up a lot rely on their motifs
a33ITEZDQwg,221599,223840,and universes while a game like tetris
a33ITEZDQwg,223840,226000,and minesweeper are almost entirely
a33ITEZDQwg,226000,228239,carried by their mechanics but sometimes
a33ITEZDQwg,228239,230080,the focus on game mechanics can lead to
a33ITEZDQwg,230080,231840,some bizarre results
a33ITEZDQwg,231840,233760,why does dawson have wacky stretchy
a33ITEZDQwg,233760,235439,limbs instead of a long-range weapon
a33ITEZDQwg,235439,237040,like normal people
a33ITEZDQwg,237040,239360,because you have to be able to hit him
a33ITEZDQwg,239360,241599,when he lifts why does this dancing
a33ITEZDQwg,241599,244319,chinese girl keep this 370 pound robot
a33ITEZDQwg,244319,246480,floating in the air like a hacky sack
a33ITEZDQwg,246480,248799,because hacky sack is fun but it gets
a33ITEZDQwg,248799,250799,even more abstract when it's all game
a33ITEZDQwg,250799,253599,mechanics with little to no motif why
a33ITEZDQwg,253599,255280,are these guys throwing a ball around
a33ITEZDQwg,255280,257440,for imaginary points are they supposed
a33ITEZDQwg,257440,259840,to be two opposing armies and the ball
a33ITEZDQwg,259840,261519,some sort of key to open the treasure
a33ITEZDQwg,261519,264479,box for points which represents gold
a33ITEZDQwg,264479,267280,also why would an iron go to jail
a33ITEZDQwg,267280,269520,like i can kind of get minesweeper but
a33ITEZDQwg,269520,272400,what is tetris supposed to be hey watch
a33ITEZDQwg,272400,276000,it don't drop that dude
a33ITEZDQwg,276400,278240,early video games with limited graphics
a33ITEZDQwg,278240,280240,were not protected by freedom of speech
a33ITEZDQwg,280240,282160,under the us constitution because they
a33ITEZDQwg,282160,284080,were seen to be no more expressive than
a33ITEZDQwg,284080,287919,past games like pinball chess or sports
a33ITEZDQwg,287919,290639,not expressive means not art but as
a33ITEZDQwg,290639,292800,graphics and data capacities got better
a33ITEZDQwg,292800,294800,games started creating more realistic
a33ITEZDQwg,294800,296880,and immersive worlds and when mortal
a33ITEZDQwg,296880,299520,kombat came out in 1992 its realistic
a33ITEZDQwg,299520,301199,violence prompted the us congress to
a33ITEZDQwg,301199,303759,have a hearing like the grinch who stole
a33ITEZDQwg,303759,305919,christmas these violent video games
a33ITEZDQwg,305919,308080,threatened to rob this particular
a33ITEZDQwg,308080,311199,holiday season of a spirit of good will
a33ITEZDQwg,311199,313199,this led to the rating system we have
a33ITEZDQwg,313199,315600,today and video games started being seen
a33ITEZDQwg,315600,317600,as expressive works worthy of free
a33ITEZDQwg,317600,319840,speech protection like film and
a33ITEZDQwg,319840,321840,television video game slowly became a
a33ITEZDQwg,321840,324479,medium expected to have adult themes
a33ITEZDQwg,324479,327030,that's not a bad trick
a33ITEZDQwg,327030,328639,[Music]
a33ITEZDQwg,328639,330479,we're used to games having motifs where
a33ITEZDQwg,330479,332240,the narrative content is not for
a33ITEZDQwg,332240,334880,everyone in the last of us 2 you have to
a33ITEZDQwg,334880,337520,kill a dog at one point to proceed and
a33ITEZDQwg,337520,339280,you may need to kill more to survive if
a33ITEZDQwg,339280,341600,they start attacking you but some people
a33ITEZDQwg,341600,344000,are not okay with killing dogs even
a33ITEZDQwg,344000,346320,virtual ones so people ended up avoiding
a33ITEZDQwg,346320,348320,them the best they could by honing their
a33ITEZDQwg,348320,350560,stealth skills there are even guides out
a33ITEZDQwg,350560,352479,there on how to do this what's
a33ITEZDQwg,352479,354160,interesting is that people chose to get
a33ITEZDQwg,354160,355759,good when they could have asked for an
a33ITEZDQwg,355759,358080,option to remove dog killing but there
a33ITEZDQwg,358080,359840,was a developer at naughty dog who
a33ITEZDQwg,359840,362080,wanted an option like this but the idea
a33ITEZDQwg,362080,363840,was shot down by the last of us writer
a33ITEZDQwg,363840,366400,and director neil druckmann he said
a33ITEZDQwg,366400,368479,ultimately the game can't shy away from
a33ITEZDQwg,368479,369919,the violence these characters are
a33ITEZDQwg,369919,371919,committing we kind of have to lean into
a33ITEZDQwg,371919,373680,that because that is what the story is
a33ITEZDQwg,373680,376400,about we could easily add a gore feature
a33ITEZDQwg,376400,378000,where you turn it off and there's no
a33ITEZDQwg,378000,379600,blood when you shoot people no
a33ITEZDQwg,379600,381520,dismemberment but at some point you
a33ITEZDQwg,381520,383520,start losing what this thing is and
a33ITEZDQwg,383520,385120,start shying too much away from the
a33ITEZDQwg,385120,386639,feeling that we're after which is
a33ITEZDQwg,386639,388880,sometimes discomfort whether you
a33ITEZDQwg,388880,390639,struggle with anxiety or certain types
a33ITEZDQwg,390639,392720,of violence last of us 2 wouldn't be
a33ITEZDQwg,392720,394560,last of us 2 without the discomfort
a33ITEZDQwg,394560,397039,that's baked into the game's motif like
a33ITEZDQwg,397039,399199,omakase sushi where the chef chooses
a33ITEZDQwg,399199,401280,what to serve for you you entrust the
a33ITEZDQwg,401280,403039,artist to give you a special experience
a33ITEZDQwg,403039,405199,whether you like it or not you don't
a33ITEZDQwg,405199,406960,have a lot of options
a33ITEZDQwg,406960,408880,but does last of us two have options to
a33ITEZDQwg,408880,410800,reduce the discomfort coming from the
a33ITEZDQwg,410800,412319,game mechanics
a33ITEZDQwg,412319,414639,yes because there are over 60 of them
a33ITEZDQwg,414639,416400,that alter the mechanics to make a more
a33ITEZDQwg,416400,418319,comfortable experience for people with
a33ITEZDQwg,418319,420639,disabilities people with motion sickness
a33ITEZDQwg,420639,422639,like me and really anyone who has
a33ITEZDQwg,422639,424400,trouble getting through the game
a33ITEZDQwg,424400,426080,there are much needed accessibility
a33ITEZDQwg,426080,428160,options like visual aids and text to
a33ITEZDQwg,428160,431360,speech square button scan for enemies
a33ITEZDQwg,431360,433440,but also super specific difficulty
a33ITEZDQwg,433440,435840,adjustments like reduced enemy accuracy
a33ITEZDQwg,435840,438080,enhanced dodging and even an option to
a33ITEZDQwg,438080,440560,slow down the game the customer gets to
a33ITEZDQwg,440560,443120,tailor their gameplay experience kind of
a33ITEZDQwg,443120,444660,like burger
a33ITEZDQwg,444660,447749,[Music]
a33ITEZDQwg,449039,451599,we ask king that you let us serve it
a33ITEZDQwg,451599,452720,your way
a33ITEZDQwg,452720,454560,but this isn't a knock on last of us
a33ITEZDQwg,454560,456400,it's just an observation that in this
a33ITEZDQwg,456400,458400,game the motif is being treated more
a33ITEZDQwg,458400,460880,like omakase while mechanics are seen as
a33ITEZDQwg,460880,464919,convenient fast food
a33ITEZDQwg,465759,468000,so why such a push to remove pain points
a33ITEZDQwg,468000,470319,from game mechanics it might be because
a33ITEZDQwg,470319,472800,ultimately video games are software and
a33ITEZDQwg,472800,475599,in software good user interfaces and ux
a33ITEZDQwg,475599,477919,are paramount peter mooreville's ux
a33ITEZDQwg,477919,479919,honeycomb outlines some principles of a
a33ITEZDQwg,479919,482000,good user experience including things
a33ITEZDQwg,482000,484560,like accessibility and usability
a33ITEZDQwg,484560,486479,software as important as computing
a33ITEZDQwg,486479,488080,operating systems must have
a33ITEZDQwg,488080,490160,accessibility options for ethical and
a33ITEZDQwg,490160,492800,legal reasons any os that matters has
a33ITEZDQwg,492800,494879,them films have them and video games
a33ITEZDQwg,494879,497599,need them as well but usability is about
a33ITEZDQwg,497599,499759,the user's ability to effectively and
a33ITEZDQwg,499759,501919,efficiently achieve their end goal and
a33ITEZDQwg,501919,504160,this is where things start to diverge
a33ITEZDQwg,504160,506319,like video games an os needs to have
a33ITEZDQwg,506319,509039,good controls on a smartphone scrolling
a33ITEZDQwg,509039,511039,through pages and switching apps must be
a33ITEZDQwg,511039,513760,quick responsive and intuitive if it
a33ITEZDQwg,513760,515839,feels sluggish like you're underwater
a33ITEZDQwg,515839,518479,then your ui is probably terrible but
a33ITEZDQwg,518479,520080,video games are different in that you
a33ITEZDQwg,520080,522320,might actually be underwater where your
a33ITEZDQwg,522320,524240,controls are purposely made to be more
a33ITEZDQwg,524240,526399,sluggish and new rules like an oxygen
a33ITEZDQwg,526399,528160,limit might further increase the
a33ITEZDQwg,528160,530240,challenge but the feeling we get from
a33ITEZDQwg,530240,532160,overcoming these challenges is what
a33ITEZDQwg,532160,533839,separates game mechanics from an
a33ITEZDQwg,533839,536160,operating system both challenges come
a33ITEZDQwg,536160,539040,the possibility of failure and in games
a33ITEZDQwg,539040,541040,failing means being put in a fail state
a33ITEZDQwg,541040,543279,which leads to losing progress losing
a33ITEZDQwg,543279,545440,resources or just losing time because
a33ITEZDQwg,545440,546720,you're stuck
a33ITEZDQwg,546720,548320,fail states can be a huge source of
a33ITEZDQwg,548320,550399,discomfort so game designers have found
a33ITEZDQwg,550399,552959,ways to make failing less painful less
a33ITEZDQwg,552959,555839,frequent or sometimes just funny
a33ITEZDQwg,555839,557519,fail states have even been cleverly
a33ITEZDQwg,557519,559360,baked into the narrative in time loop
a33ITEZDQwg,559360,561519,games to make it unmistakably clear that
a33ITEZDQwg,561519,564160,failing equals progress i'm stuck in a
a33ITEZDQwg,564160,566880,time loop and i can prove it but not all
a33ITEZDQwg,566880,568720,ways of reducing pain points are the
a33ITEZDQwg,568720,571279,same even extreme ones like letting the
a33ITEZDQwg,571279,573040,players skip levels
a33ITEZDQwg,573040,574880,in super mario brothers you can skip
a33ITEZDQwg,574880,576959,worlds but you have to discover a secret
a33ITEZDQwg,576959,578959,room in order to do it there's a
a33ITEZDQwg,578959,581440,challenge to it but why not just have an
a33ITEZDQwg,581440,583040,option to skip to these worlds from the
a33ITEZDQwg,583040,584880,settings at the start
a33ITEZDQwg,584880,586880,of course there's no challenge to that
a33ITEZDQwg,586880,588320,and the game will become more like an
a33ITEZDQwg,588320,590000,operating system that's helping you get
a33ITEZDQwg,590000,591440,to your content with as little
a33ITEZDQwg,591440,593600,resistance as possible that's the
a33ITEZDQwg,593600,595200,difference between allowing the player
a33ITEZDQwg,595200,597279,to find scuba gear and letting them have
a33ITEZDQwg,597279,599680,infinite breath from the settings menu
a33ITEZDQwg,599680,601440,but of course if your game is about the
a33ITEZDQwg,601440,603839,story too many challenges might ruin its
a33ITEZDQwg,603839,604720,flow
a33ITEZDQwg,604720,606480,but what happens when you design the
a33ITEZDQwg,606480,608160,mechanics so that you're supposed to
a33ITEZDQwg,608160,610800,fail a lot
a33ITEZDQwg,612640,614320,the from software games have no way to
a33ITEZDQwg,614320,616240,turn off the difficulty in the settings
a33ITEZDQwg,616240,618399,and no option for an easy mode
a33ITEZDQwg,618399,620240,and no they don't do the obnoxious thing
a33ITEZDQwg,620240,621920,where the enemies get easier when you're
a33ITEZDQwg,621920,623839,losing without telling you they just
a33ITEZDQwg,623839,625680,made one difficulty mode which is
a33ITEZDQwg,625680,628160,extremely challenging but also extremely
a33ITEZDQwg,628160,629120,fair
a33ITEZDQwg,629120,630880,at one point the completion rate for
a33ITEZDQwg,630880,632720,dark souls 3 was around the same as
a33ITEZDQwg,632720,635040,uncharted 4 which has a walk in the park
a33ITEZDQwg,635040,636240,easy mode
a33ITEZDQwg,636240,637600,but the difference is the sense of
a33ITEZDQwg,637600,639440,accomplishment players felt after
a33ITEZDQwg,639440,641440,beating a souls game overcoming the
a33ITEZDQwg,641440,643279,challenges this game throws at you is a
a33ITEZDQwg,643279,645040,feeling i have never experienced from
a33ITEZDQwg,645040,647040,any other type of game what made these
a33ITEZDQwg,647040,648480,souls games so critically and
a33ITEZDQwg,648480,650880,commercially successful is how miyazaki
a33ITEZDQwg,650880,653120,approached difficulty he had five
a33ITEZDQwg,653120,654240,principles
a33ITEZDQwg,654240,656079,any player can clear any obstacles
a33ITEZDQwg,656079,657760,simply by learning from mistakes and
a33ITEZDQwg,657760,659920,paying close attention the reasons for
a33ITEZDQwg,659920,661440,failure must always be clear and
a33ITEZDQwg,661440,663600,understandable every problem must have
a33ITEZDQwg,663600,665360,multiple solutions so that the player
a33ITEZDQwg,665360,667839,can tackle it in whichever way they want
a33ITEZDQwg,667839,669279,the game's controls can never be a
a33ITEZDQwg,669279,672240,factor from which difficulty is derived
a33ITEZDQwg,672240,673839,and finally there must be the
a33ITEZDQwg,673839,676000,possibility for miracles to happen those
a33ITEZDQwg,676000,678000,magical moments that spread stories
a33ITEZDQwg,678000,679600,outside of the confines of the game
a33ITEZDQwg,679600,682399,world this last one shows why artists or
a33ITEZDQwg,682399,684320,game devs choose not to want too many
a33ITEZDQwg,684320,686480,modified versions of their work
a33ITEZDQwg,686480,688240,the audience must have an experience
a33ITEZDQwg,688240,689839,unified enough so we know we're talking
a33ITEZDQwg,689839,691360,about the same thing
a33ITEZDQwg,691360,693519,without this it's difficult for cultures
a33ITEZDQwg,693519,695600,and communities to form around it and
a33ITEZDQwg,695600,697680,this is how works get defined as art in
a33ITEZDQwg,697680,700079,the first place even making a version
a33ITEZDQwg,700079,702240,decades later that slightly changes the
a33ITEZDQwg,702240,704800,order of events in one scene can cause
a33ITEZDQwg,704800,706880,mayhem neil druckmann wanted the
a33ITEZDQwg,706880,708640,narrative to be the unified experience
a33ITEZDQwg,708640,710959,while hirataka miyazaki wanted to focus
a33ITEZDQwg,710959,714440,it on the challenge
a33ITEZDQwg,716160,717839,so is the challenge that comes from game
a33ITEZDQwg,717839,719519,mechanics art
a33ITEZDQwg,719519,722079,it's hard to say because for a long time
a33ITEZDQwg,722079,723839,people who made games have been seen as
a33ITEZDQwg,723839,726000,inventors and you don't really think of
a33ITEZDQwg,726000,728480,thomas edison as an artist but after
a33ITEZDQwg,728480,730480,video games started creating realistic
a33ITEZDQwg,730480,732399,worlds the role of game mechanics became
a33ITEZDQwg,732399,734240,an integral part of how we perceive
a33ITEZDQwg,734240,736639,these worlds you can easily take assets
a33ITEZDQwg,736639,738880,from good games and make a terrible one
a33ITEZDQwg,738880,741040,where cyclops superpower is standing
a33ITEZDQwg,741040,742079,light kick
a33ITEZDQwg,742079,743680,you can also take footage from a horror
a33ITEZDQwg,743680,746639,movie and make it a romantic comedy
a33ITEZDQwg,746639,748480,meet jack torrence
a33ITEZDQwg,748480,751360,i'm outlining a new writing project he's
a33ITEZDQwg,751360,753839,a writer looking for inspiration
a33ITEZDQwg,753839,755600,this is why i see game mechanics kind of
a33ITEZDQwg,755600,758320,like editing in film multiple difficulty
a33ITEZDQwg,758320,760720,levels are like multiple cuts of a film
a33ITEZDQwg,760720,762959,each with a different experience easy
a33ITEZDQwg,762959,764560,mode is the cut that makes you feel like
a33ITEZDQwg,764560,766880,a superhero sometimes all you want is
a33ITEZDQwg,766880,768560,for the game to make you feel like
a33ITEZDQwg,768560,770480,batman and sometimes you want a cut that
a33ITEZDQwg,770480,772959,makes you feel like the karate kid
a33ITEZDQwg,772959,775519,are you okay oh just leave me alone
a33ITEZDQwg,775519,777519,while it can be nice to have options
a33ITEZDQwg,777519,779519,does every game need to have every
a33ITEZDQwg,779519,780880,experience
a33ITEZDQwg,780880,782959,after the fallout from his post arguing
a33ITEZDQwg,782959,785200,why video games can never be art ebert
a33ITEZDQwg,785200,787200,made a follow-up post where he maintains
a33ITEZDQwg,787200,789440,his position but admits it was a mistake
a33ITEZDQwg,789440,791200,to state such a bold claim because he
a33ITEZDQwg,791200,793600,doesn't really play games he understood
a33ITEZDQwg,793600,795440,one's interpretive ability of a video
a33ITEZDQwg,795440,797279,game depended on knowing how to play
a33ITEZDQwg,797279,799120,them as some game critics learned the
a33ITEZDQwg,799120,801680,hard way like how films are audio and
a33ITEZDQwg,801680,804399,visual games are mechanics and motif
a33ITEZDQwg,804399,806320,interpreting video games without playing
a33ITEZDQwg,806320,808240,them is like interpreting film with the
a33ITEZDQwg,808240,810639,audio turned off this misunderstanding
a33ITEZDQwg,810639,812560,about the role of mechanics is why ebert
a33ITEZDQwg,812560,814079,couldn't get over the fact that games
a33ITEZDQwg,814079,816320,could have malleability in the narrative
a33ITEZDQwg,816320,817920,he was worried it could devolve into
a33ITEZDQwg,817920,819920,things like an alternate happy ending to
a33ITEZDQwg,819920,822720,romeo and juliet but even he mentions at
a33ITEZDQwg,822720,824639,one point that theaters actually did
a33ITEZDQwg,824639,827360,that in the 18th century whether a video
a33ITEZDQwg,827360,829440,game can be art lies in the hands of
a33ITEZDQwg,829440,831519,those who are making them game writers
a33ITEZDQwg,831519,833519,have irreversibly killed off popular
a33ITEZDQwg,833519,835360,characters so we know they're willing to
a33ITEZDQwg,835360,837760,commit to their story and universe even
a33ITEZDQwg,837760,839440,if it won't be appealing to everybody
a33ITEZDQwg,839440,841600,out there if the same can stay true for
a33ITEZDQwg,841600,843360,the ones designing the mechanics
a33ITEZDQwg,843360,845440,gameplay will go beyond entertainment
a33ITEZDQwg,845440,847360,and it'll be much easier to say ebird
a33ITEZDQwg,847360,849519,was wrong this was gerald from quarry

a33ITEZDQwg,865680,867519,of the most prone to getting hacked and
a33ITEZDQwg,867519,870079,a good vpn can offer protection i set
