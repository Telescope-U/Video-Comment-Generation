-mU7rEpAe10,1089,2650,- [Matt] Why always with the table?
-mU7rEpAe10,2650,4460,- I gotta just get my pre-Mystery Tech stretch in.
-mU7rEpAe10,4460,6360,- [Matt] You have a floor.
-mU7rEpAe10,6360,7410,"- Ow wow,"
-mU7rEpAe10,7410,9719,"that actually like, that hit me with some force."
-mU7rEpAe10,9720,11240,So if you're familiar with this little device
-mU7rEpAe10,11240,12570,"called the Steam Deck,"
-mU7rEpAe10,12570,14549,it promises to give a ton of performance
-mU7rEpAe10,14550,16340,in a Switch like form factor.
-mU7rEpAe10,16340,18230,"Well, as a lot of people point out,"
-mU7rEpAe10,18230,19910,Aya Neo have been doing something like that
-mU7rEpAe10,19910,20743,for even longer.
-mU7rEpAe10,20743,21920,"And this is the new version,"
-mU7rEpAe10,21920,25630,which is called The Aya Neo
-mU7rEpAe10,27660,28663,NEXT.
-mU7rEpAe10,29710,30592,- [Crew Member] Yes.
-mU7rEpAe10,30592,31425,- That's a very - Is that it?
-mU7rEpAe10,31425,32258,Did I get it right?
-mU7rEpAe10,32258,33360,- [Ken] It's a very boring name.
-mU7rEpAe10,33360,34853,- It's the NEXT one.
-mU7rEpAe10,35991,38070,That was not as satisfying as I thought it was going to be.
-mU7rEpAe10,38070,39079,Explore the future.
-mU7rEpAe10,39080,41160,"Oh, oh my God."
-mU7rEpAe10,41160,44250,"Memorial name plate AYANEO NEXT, Austin Evans."
-mU7rEpAe10,44250,46340,Can you see that? It's got a cool.
-mU7rEpAe10,46340,48370,"All right look,"
-mU7rEpAe10,48370,50829,I'm a sucker for things that have my name on them.
-mU7rEpAe10,50830,53123,"The reveal is,"
-mU7rEpAe10,54020,55300,"oh, that looks like a switch."
-mU7rEpAe10,55300,56800,"All right, let's go."
-mU7rEpAe10,56800,57870,Wow.
-mU7rEpAe10,57870,59275,- [Ken] Why? Why?
-mU7rEpAe10,59276,60130,(laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,60130,63230,What do you hope to gain from smelling all these products?
-mU7rEpAe10,63230,65984,- You've ever been to a Payless shoe store?
-mU7rEpAe10,65984,66900,(laughing)
-mU7rEpAe10,66900,68470,I got this. (laughing)
-mU7rEpAe10,68470,70120,"Real talk though, first impressions."
-mU7rEpAe10,70120,71550,This all feels like it's metal.
-mU7rEpAe10,71550,72383,"Well, this bottom is plastic."
-mU7rEpAe10,72383,73870,But I think the front is actual metal.
-mU7rEpAe10,73870,76370,Those are the USB-C on top and on bottom.
-mU7rEpAe10,76370,77300,- [Ken] I like the big air flow
-mU7rEpAe10,77300,78980,is also out of your touch points too.
-mU7rEpAe10,78980,80030,"- [Austin] Yeah, yeah. - It's like in the middle"
-mU7rEpAe10,80030,80863,and on the top.
-mU7rEpAe10,80863,83520,"- My concern with this as is the Steam Deck, right?"
-mU7rEpAe10,83520,84829,There's a lot of heft here.
-mU7rEpAe10,84830,86290,"If you're used to using the Switch,"
-mU7rEpAe10,86290,87750,I even use the Switch Lite.
-mU7rEpAe10,87750,88970,You can play that pretty comfortably
-mU7rEpAe10,88970,90270,for a long period of time.
-mU7rEpAe10,90270,91500,"This weighs more, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,91500,92440,"It's just simply bigger,"
-mU7rEpAe10,92440,93540,which means that you're gonna have
-mU7rEpAe10,93540,95040,a little bit more strain on your wrist
-mU7rEpAe10,95040,96130,because you have to hold it up.
-mU7rEpAe10,96130,97290,"But, that being said,"
-mU7rEpAe10,97290,98810,this should have a lot more performance.
-mU7rEpAe10,98810,100823,"So, this is a Ryzen 7 5800U."
-mU7rEpAe10,102050,103370,"Unlike the Steam Deck,"
-mU7rEpAe10,103370,106950,"which is using the newer style of AMD processor,"
-mU7rEpAe10,106950,110600,it's a custom 4 core with RDNA graphics.
-mU7rEpAe10,110600,112380,"This instead is using an 8 core processor,"
-mU7rEpAe10,112380,114189,but the older Vega graphics.
-mU7rEpAe10,114190,117860,We also have a 2 terabyte SSD inside.
-mU7rEpAe10,117860,120490,How much is the Aya Neo NEXT?
-mU7rEpAe10,120490,122500,"'Cause this is in the go go at the moment,"
-mU7rEpAe10,122500,123530,or is this actually on sale yet?
-mU7rEpAe10,123530,127312,"- [Jared] So, the Neo Next is 1345 for the 2 terabyte."
-mU7rEpAe10,128450,129840,- 1300 bucks.
-mU7rEpAe10,129840,132019,That's a little bit more expensive than the Steam Deck.
-mU7rEpAe10,132020,136410,"Now, they did say that this is not a complete final unit."
-mU7rEpAe10,136410,138310,So this is still early.
-mU7rEpAe10,138310,139380,I think that they're still going
-mU7rEpAe10,139380,140670,through the prototyping phase.
-mU7rEpAe10,140670,143230,"So, what I'm not gonna do is go through benchmarks"
-mU7rEpAe10,143230,144440,and all that kind of stuff.
-mU7rEpAe10,144440,147900,Let's hop into a game of Forza.
-mU7rEpAe10,147900,149409,"I mean, we're getting like mid forties frames"
-mU7rEpAe10,149410,150243,per second right now.
-mU7rEpAe10,150243,152530,"So, right now I am running at medium settings"
-mU7rEpAe10,152530,154060,at 1280 x 800.
-mU7rEpAe10,154060,155330,I'm a big fan of the triggers.
-mU7rEpAe10,155330,156740,'Cause I believe the first Aya Neo
-mU7rEpAe10,156740,158690,"didn't have analog triggers, right?"
-mU7rEpAe10,158690,160700,"- [Jared] No, it just had buttons essentially."
-mU7rEpAe10,160700,162180,"- [Austin] Which that ain't it,"
-mU7rEpAe10,162180,163969,"especially if you ever play any racing games,"
-mU7rEpAe10,163970,166070,you wanna have full analog triggers.
-mU7rEpAe10,166070,168250,"To me, it's hard to justify spending over"
-mU7rEpAe10,168250,171460,"a thousand dollars on any kind of portable gaming PC,"
-mU7rEpAe10,171460,172840,when the Steam Deck is so close.
-mU7rEpAe10,172840,175099,The Steam Deck feels like it's really similar
-mU7rEpAe10,175100,176540,in a lot of ways and half the price.
-mU7rEpAe10,176540,177549,It's tough to justify it.
-mU7rEpAe10,177550,179480,"- [Jared] I just think saying,"
-mU7rEpAe10,179480,181090,"oh, you just have to get a Steam Deck"
-mU7rEpAe10,181090,183599,is just not the exact comparison.
-mU7rEpAe10,183600,185620,"Although they're in the same class,"
-mU7rEpAe10,185620,187450,they're not the same product.
-mU7rEpAe10,187450,190230,This allows you to go up to 2 terabytes of storage.
-mU7rEpAe10,190230,192420,This is much smaller than the Steam Deck.
-mU7rEpAe10,192420,194670,It has a bigger battery than the Steam Deck.
-mU7rEpAe10,194670,196270,It's still gonna come eventually
-mU7rEpAe10,196270,198450,with the same specs as the Steam Deck.
-mU7rEpAe10,198450,200620,It's a more premium version of the same thing.
-mU7rEpAe10,200620,202840,"Sure, you can go buy a Civic,"
-mU7rEpAe10,202840,204530,but you can also go buy a Mercedes.
-mU7rEpAe10,204530,206250,I'm not saying that you shouldn't go
-mU7rEpAe10,206250,207450,buy a Steam Deck. - Yeah.
-mU7rEpAe10,207450,208678,- [Jared] What I'm saying is
-mU7rEpAe10,208678,209629,- You think this is better.
-mU7rEpAe10,209630,210930,- [Jared] You should not discount this.
-mU7rEpAe10,210930,213140,"And I would think if I had the money,"
-mU7rEpAe10,213140,215920,"I would rather have a smaller, more portable device."
-mU7rEpAe10,215920,217270,That's more easy to put into a bag.
-mU7rEpAe10,217270,218860,"- Well, it sounds like is that we're gonna"
-mU7rEpAe10,218860,221120,do a head to head comparison between the Aya Neo NEXT
-mU7rEpAe10,221120,222629,and the Steam Deck as soon as that comes out.
-mU7rEpAe10,222630,223670,"Make sure you're subscribed,"
-mU7rEpAe10,223670,224990,ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling bell
-mU7rEpAe10,224990,227840,"for Jared and I and our slug fest,"
-mU7rEpAe10,227840,230810,to determine what the best Switch replacement is.
-mU7rEpAe10,230810,232617,"That's, just buy the switch actually."
-mU7rEpAe10,232617,235367,(dramatic music)
-mU7rEpAe10,236204,238140,(packaging rumbling)
-mU7rEpAe10,238140,238972,- Give it.
-mU7rEpAe10,238973,240440,(laughing)
-mU7rEpAe10,240440,242047,- I thought you were gonna fall for it.
-mU7rEpAe10,242047,243209,"I thought, I actually could grab it."
-mU7rEpAe10,243210,248210,"Hello, friends and welcome to the Razer Zephyr mask."
-mU7rEpAe10,249065,251410,"Oh, I didn't even think you would think of me like."
-mU7rEpAe10,251410,252700,"Aw, I'm so excited."
-mU7rEpAe10,252700,256680,"So, if you're not familiar with our friends over at Razer."
-mU7rEpAe10,256680,259100,They make some wacky stuff sometimes.
-mU7rEpAe10,259100,261560,We made an entire video on some of the goofy stuff
-mU7rEpAe10,261560,262500,that Razer makes.
-mU7rEpAe10,262500,266290,But this has gotta be top 10 weird things.
-mU7rEpAe10,266290,270170,"This is a Bluetooth mask, that has not only RGB"
-mU7rEpAe10,270170,273690,"because Razer, it also has changeable filters"
-mU7rEpAe10,273690,277562,"and it has (indistinct), right?"
-mU7rEpAe10,277562,278460,(laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,278460,280819,"Oh boy, it's got a motor inside."
-mU7rEpAe10,280820,282610,"So, you're not just breathing in and out."
-mU7rEpAe10,282610,284580,You're being pure.
-mU7rEpAe10,284580,286069,- [Matt] You're circulating air.
-mU7rEpAe10,286070,287660,I have a way that we can test this
-mU7rEpAe10,287660,289010,that you may or may not approve of.
-mU7rEpAe10,289010,289843,- Fart on my face.
-mU7rEpAe10,289843,290692,(laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,290692,292270,- [Matt] That's how you get pink eye.
-mU7rEpAe10,292270,293103,- No. (laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,293103,294798,"- Oh, activate."
-mU7rEpAe10,294798,297770,(motor whirring)
-mU7rEpAe10,297770,298979,It's a nice little hump.
-mU7rEpAe10,298980,300900,"Gotta say if this is actually how loud it is though,"
-mU7rEpAe10,300900,301979,that's kind of wild.
-mU7rEpAe10,301980,304240,Put the bottom strap around my nape.
-mU7rEpAe10,304240,305250,What's my nape?
-mU7rEpAe10,305250,306083,- Is this? - Oh my god.
-mU7rEpAe10,306083,307380,- The back of your neck. - The back of your neck.
-mU7rEpAe10,307380,308450,"- Oh, well I can breathe."
-mU7rEpAe10,308450,309555,"I can hear the fans, like"
-mU7rEpAe10,309555,312097,- [Ken] I don't like that I can you see your mouth.
-mU7rEpAe10,312097,314098,(laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,314098,317863,"No, no, no, no, no."
-mU7rEpAe10,317864,318697,(laughs)
-mU7rEpAe10,318697,319530,"- So, when it comes to the Zephyr,"
-mU7rEpAe10,319530,321090,I have a few different functions.
-mU7rEpAe10,321090,323110,So right now I'm on low fan speed.
-mU7rEpAe10,323110,324990,"I can kinda do this, although honestly,"
-mU7rEpAe10,324990,327240,I feel like I want it on high just cause I need more airflow
-mU7rEpAe10,327240,329210,"and now I can change my internal lighting, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,329210,332613,"So, you see my mouth right now. So I'm going to go blue."
-mU7rEpAe10,334690,336140,"- [Ken] God, that's even worse."
-mU7rEpAe10,336140,338020,"No, no. (grunts)"
-mU7rEpAe10,338020,339323,That's slightly better.
-mU7rEpAe10,340348,341610,(grunts)
-mU7rEpAe10,341610,343000,- Would you guys wear one of these?
-mU7rEpAe10,343000,343833,- [Jared] Nope.
-mU7rEpAe10,344810,346153,- [Ken] Nope with a 10 foot pole.
-mU7rEpAe10,346153,347770,- [Matt] Not a chance.
-mU7rEpAe10,347770,351610,- [Ken] I don't want people hyper-focusing on my mouth.
-mU7rEpAe10,351610,354310,"Those two LEDs next to it,"
-mU7rEpAe10,354310,355593,"Look really cool,"
-mU7rEpAe10,356550,360569,"but when it lights your mouth, no."
-mU7rEpAe10,360570,363220,- I personally don't think that being able to see my mouth
-mU7rEpAe10,363220,365120,"is the most important thing for me,"
-mU7rEpAe10,365120,365953,but I understand that
-mU7rEpAe10,365953,367090,for a lot of people - Do you know what it is?
-mU7rEpAe10,367090,367923,- that actually is a major selling point.
-mU7rEpAe10,367923,369193,- [Ken] No I figured it out.
-mU7rEpAe10,370160,373830,"The, the way that the plastic is curved on it."
-mU7rEpAe10,373830,374663,- Yeah.
-mU7rEpAe10,374663,376943,- [Ken] It magnifies the size of your mouth.
-mU7rEpAe10,379460,382530,"- [Matt] I don't no, no, no. You stop that."
-mU7rEpAe10,382530,383880,- [Jared] Is that white?
-mU7rEpAe10,383880,386919,- This looks like Logic [censored] Annoying Orange.
-mU7rEpAe10,386919,388784,(everyone laughing)
-mU7rEpAe10,388784,390139,(dramatic music)
-mU7rEpAe10,390140,393930,"- Activate Mystery Tech, Ultimate Ears."
-mU7rEpAe10,393930,395370,Are these headphones?
-mU7rEpAe10,395370,397229,For your ears only.
-mU7rEpAe10,397230,399910,Follow these simple steps to find your perfect fit.
-mU7rEpAe10,399910,401770,"So, typically when it comes to doing"
-mU7rEpAe10,401770,403900,"these fully custom in-ear monitors,"
-mU7rEpAe10,403900,405699,"you have to actually go to a space,"
-mU7rEpAe10,405700,407240,they need to measure your ears
-mU7rEpAe10,407240,409180,and they essentially build a custom set of headphones
-mU7rEpAe10,409180,410930,"that are exactly meant for you, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,410930,412500,"This is what you see like artists,"
-mU7rEpAe10,412500,414100,"when they're out there performing and stuff, you know,"
-mU7rEpAe10,414100,416060,they have that custom in ear piece in.
-mU7rEpAe10,416060,417300,Ballers essentially.
-mU7rEpAe10,417300,422300,"- [Ken] So, these are actually not too bad, 250."
-mU7rEpAe10,422540,423373,- That's it?
-mU7rEpAe10,423373,426710,"So, just for context, these custom in-ear monitors"
-mU7rEpAe10,426710,428560,"typically will cost you, I mean,"
-mU7rEpAe10,428560,429840,"I think starting at 500 bucks,"
-mU7rEpAe10,429840,431570,but they oftentimes will go up to
-mU7rEpAe10,431570,432970,and above a thousand dollars.
-mU7rEpAe10,432970,433970,"I mean, they're very expensive."
-mU7rEpAe10,433970,434803,"Because think about it,"
-mU7rEpAe10,434803,436860,you're not just buying a nice pair of earphones.
-mU7rEpAe10,436860,438550,You're buying something which has been completely
-mU7rEpAe10,438550,440139,custom molded to your ears.
-mU7rEpAe10,440140,442530,"All right, so, we're gonna take our case,"
-mU7rEpAe10,442530,444290,"we're gonna open it up,"
-mU7rEpAe10,444290,446550,"place our earbuds in, try them on."
-mU7rEpAe10,446550,447550,Okay.
-mU7rEpAe10,447550,449780,You mold both sides at the same time.
-mU7rEpAe10,449780,452350,"Okay, so we're basically, I'm going to put them in my ears,"
-mU7rEpAe10,452350,454530,adjust them until they feel comfortable. Okay.
-mU7rEpAe10,454530,457130,I mean that pretty much immediately feels pretty good to me.
-mU7rEpAe10,457130,459130,"So, it's just playing a little bit of like a beat."
-mU7rEpAe10,459130,461360,"So, I just need to like gently adjust them until I find it,"
-mU7rEpAe10,461360,462750,where it sounds the best.
-mU7rEpAe10,462750,464940,"Oh, they're about to start getting warm"
-mU7rEpAe10,464940,466330,and molding to my ears.
-mU7rEpAe10,466330,467163,Oh boy.
-mU7rEpAe10,468100,469890,"Oh, it's getting warm. Whoa."
-mU7rEpAe10,469890,472200,"Okay. They're very warm right now, but it's happening."
-mU7rEpAe10,472200,473640,They're essentially curing the tips.
-mU7rEpAe10,473640,474850,"Yo, this is very cool."
-mU7rEpAe10,474850,477180,"So, I' am gonna go ahead and put them back in the case now"
-mU7rEpAe10,477180,479470,and install the software update.
-mU7rEpAe10,479470,481900,- [Ken] Battery life apparently is eight hours
-mU7rEpAe10,481900,483220,"of earbud battery life,"
-mU7rEpAe10,483220,485229,- [Austin] Okay. - 20 hours with the case.
-mU7rEpAe10,485229,486062,- [Austin] Okay.
-mU7rEpAe10,486062,488250,- [Ken] 10 minutes of charge for 60 minutes of listening.
-mU7rEpAe10,488250,489410,- That all sounds pretty solid.
-mU7rEpAe10,489410,490990,8 hours is actually pretty good considering
-mU7rEpAe10,490990,493410,that most earbuds like AirPods and Galaxy Buds
-mU7rEpAe10,493410,496160,"are usually a little closer to like three to five,"
-mU7rEpAe10,496160,497350,I think is probably the norm.
-mU7rEpAe10,497350,499230,"There are a couple of concerning things,"
-mU7rEpAe10,499230,501180,as far as using these as like daily earbuds.
-mU7rEpAe10,501180,503139,"The case is big, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,503140,505223,"I'll try to fit it into my little pocket, but like,"
-mU7rEpAe10,505223,506530,this is always the test.
-mU7rEpAe10,506530,508510,Can a pair of earbuds live
-mU7rEpAe10,508510,510050,"in your little coin pocket, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,510050,511000,"'Cause if it can't,"
-mU7rEpAe10,512219,514310,"I'm not gonna say I'm not going to carry them all day,"
-mU7rEpAe10,514310,516430,but I only have so many pockets
-mU7rEpAe10,516430,517912,and this is my earbud pocket.
-mU7rEpAe10,519289,521039,"Ooh, that's chunky."
-mU7rEpAe10,521039,522360,I could carry these.
-mU7rEpAe10,522360,523839,"That's borderline too big,"
-mU7rEpAe10,523840,524960,but I think it might work.
-mU7rEpAe10,524960,526220,"I'll immediately say,"
-mU7rEpAe10,526220,529290,I think the left is a little bit of a better fit
-mU7rEpAe10,529290,530410,than the right.
-mU7rEpAe10,530410,531779,"I hear a little bit more bleed from the right,"
-mU7rEpAe10,531780,533700,but let me actually do the test and see.
-mU7rEpAe10,533700,536300,It looks like your ear buds are fitting well.
-mU7rEpAe10,536300,538750,"I said everything's okay. And it's like, great."
-mU7rEpAe10,538750,539780,Everything's good.
-mU7rEpAe10,539780,541720,The thing that I just kinda paused a little bit
-mU7rEpAe10,541720,543750,"with these though, is the sound quality."
-mU7rEpAe10,543750,544730,They don't sound bad.
-mU7rEpAe10,544730,547040,I would put them in the same category as something
-mU7rEpAe10,547040,548089,"like a pair of AirPods,"
-mU7rEpAe10,548090,551340,"but that's not a ringing endorsement, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,551340,553170,If you think about the Statuses that we take a look at
-mU7rEpAe10,553170,554769,"on a previous episode of Mystery Tech,"
-mU7rEpAe10,554770,556180,excellent sound quality.
-mU7rEpAe10,556180,558070,And they have that really long battery life
-mU7rEpAe10,558070,559730,"admittedly in a chunky sort of case,"
-mU7rEpAe10,559730,561449,but they're certainly not this expensive.
-mU7rEpAe10,561450,564090,"If the fit is the most important thing you're looking for,"
-mU7rEpAe10,564090,565160,"then yeah, these are great."
-mU7rEpAe10,565160,567730,But the problem is is that there are other headphones
-mU7rEpAe10,567730,570820,"that are cheaper, that deliver similar sound quality"
-mU7rEpAe10,570820,573750,"and a whole lot more features, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,573750,577460,"With active noise cancellation, with the transparency mode,"
-mU7rEpAe10,577460,580200,with the ability to easily swap between devices.
-mU7rEpAe10,580200,582210,These really have one claim to fame.
-mU7rEpAe10,582210,583370,"And while it's good,"
-mU7rEpAe10,583370,585510,I don't know if it's $250 good
-mU7rEpAe10,585510,587776,when so many other great Bluetooth headphones exist.
-mU7rEpAe10,587776,588710,(dramatic music)
-mU7rEpAe10,588710,591041,"Hey Ken, I have a proposition for you."
-mU7rEpAe10,591041,592060,- [Ken] Mm-hmm.
-mU7rEpAe10,592060,593980,I'm gonna run this segment of Mystery Tech.
-mU7rEpAe10,593980,595639,"Hello, it's me, Austin."
-mU7rEpAe10,595640,596650,Greetings friends.
-mU7rEpAe10,596650,599440,"Today, I'm gonna share some of my favorite tech"
-mU7rEpAe10,599440,600630,"with the room,"
-mU7rEpAe10,600630,601770,"except that I'm going to keep it all,"
-mU7rEpAe10,601770,603283,but you guys could get to watch me open it.
-mU7rEpAe10,603283,605350,(packaging rumbling)
-mU7rEpAe10,605350,606620,The tyranny is over.
-mU7rEpAe10,606620,609670,This right here is the Analogue Pocket.
-mU7rEpAe10,609670,612540,Now Analogue has made a number of different
-mU7rEpAe10,612540,615310,retro inspired devices over the years.
-mU7rEpAe10,615310,616800,"In fact, back in like 2016 or something,"
-mU7rEpAe10,616800,620290,"we actually did a video on the Analogue, what was it?"
-mU7rEpAe10,620290,622970,"The NES, whatever they called it, the NT or something,"
-mU7rEpAe10,622970,625100,"but the Pocket is without a doubt,"
-mU7rEpAe10,625100,627673,the most ambitious console they've done yet.
-mU7rEpAe10,629000,630330,The Analogue Pocket. Oh my god.
-mU7rEpAe10,630330,631163,I'm so.
-mU7rEpAe10,631163,633040,"This thing is, mm."
-mU7rEpAe10,633040,635709,I am gonna touch it for the first time.
-mU7rEpAe10,635710,636543,It's plastic.
-mU7rEpAe10,637920,639240,I definitely thought this was metal.
-mU7rEpAe10,639240,641810,"If you've played a Game Boy or any kind of,"
-mU7rEpAe10,641810,645883,"sort of more old school console that uses a 1989 LCD,"
-mU7rEpAe10,647707,649610,"you know the screens are terrible, right."
-mU7rEpAe10,649610,650680,No back lighting.
-mU7rEpAe10,650680,652399,The thing with the Analogue Pocket
-mU7rEpAe10,652400,655610,is that it has such a modern high resolution display
-mU7rEpAe10,655610,657800,"that it can not only play the game,"
-mU7rEpAe10,657800,660339,but you actually can get all of the little sub pixel detail
-mU7rEpAe10,660340,661740,and accurate color and what not.
-mU7rEpAe10,661740,664140,"From what I've seen, this thing is next level."
-mU7rEpAe10,664140,667240,"I'm gonna update the OS, but Analogue were very kind"
-mU7rEpAe10,667240,670320,to send over quite literally all of the accessories.
-mU7rEpAe10,670320,671420,The Game Gear adapter.
-mU7rEpAe10,671420,674079,"So, the nice thing is this out of the box,"
-mU7rEpAe10,674080,675920,"will work with Game Boy, Game Boy Color"
-mU7rEpAe10,675920,676940,and Game Boy Advance games.
-mU7rEpAe10,676940,678220,You can just drop them right in.
-mU7rEpAe10,678220,679860,"But if you wanna play some other titles,"
-mU7rEpAe10,679860,681130,"including Game Gear games,"
-mU7rEpAe10,681130,682950,you can add the little adapters
-mU7rEpAe10,682950,684030,and it'll work for that as well.
-mU7rEpAe10,684030,685580,Whereas of the Analogue Dock.
-mU7rEpAe10,685580,686940,"So, if all this wasn't enough,"
-mU7rEpAe10,686940,688970,you can hook this up via USB-C
-mU7rEpAe10,688970,691089,and then you are able to play your game
-mU7rEpAe10,691090,693950,"in high-quality on a TV, which is nice."
-mU7rEpAe10,693950,695960,"Although, let's face it."
-mU7rEpAe10,695960,697400,I wanna play it on the actual display.
-mU7rEpAe10,697400,699090,The OS is incredibly simple.
-mU7rEpAe10,699090,702820,Nanoloop is the digital work station for GBA.
-mU7rEpAe10,702820,704310,I'll make music.
-mU7rEpAe10,704310,705556,I'm making music first.
-mU7rEpAe10,705556,707320,(music beats)
-mU7rEpAe10,707320,709160,I don't know how to make beats. We're just gonna move on.
-mU7rEpAe10,709160,710449,I'll leave that to Josh. Okay.
-mU7rEpAe10,710450,711730,Josh know what he's doing. Okay.
-mU7rEpAe10,711730,713620,Let's start with the original Game Boy game.
-mU7rEpAe10,713620,714453,(old school game music)
-mU7rEpAe10,714453,716580,Oh my God. That looks great.
-mU7rEpAe10,716580,717413,"Let's go, boys."
-mU7rEpAe10,717413,721569,"Let's go. Oh, no get out of the way, Lewis!"
-mU7rEpAe10,721569,723399,"- [Ken] Blue flag, blue flag."
-mU7rEpAe10,723400,725740,- The way that it emulates the Game Boy's screen
-mU7rEpAe10,725740,726610,is incredible.
-mU7rEpAe10,726610,728490,Because you can see the individual pixels.
-mU7rEpAe10,728490,731050,"You also see like the lines, the go around the pixels."
-mU7rEpAe10,731050,732786,"Oh, that is sweet. All right."
-mU7rEpAe10,732786,733619,All right. All right.
-mU7rEpAe10,733619,734452,I get the idea.
-mU7rEpAe10,734452,735700,Let's actually play a game that's not terrible.
-mU7rEpAe10,735700,737310,Polaris SnoCross.
-mU7rEpAe10,737310,739250,Is this a 60 FPS game on a Game Boy?
-mU7rEpAe10,739250,740220,Holy crap.
-mU7rEpAe10,740220,742240,"Well, that makes such a big difference to the responsiveness"
-mU7rEpAe10,742240,743430,"compared to like F1 race,"
-mU7rEpAe10,743430,744810,which is like five frames per second.
-mU7rEpAe10,744810,746610,"We can use Game Gear, we can use a bunch of other things."
-mU7rEpAe10,746610,749540,"But, what I'm curious about is how it handled"
-mU7rEpAe10,749540,750373,"a Game Boy Advance game,"
-mU7rEpAe10,750373,751579,"which has not only a different resolution,"
-mU7rEpAe10,751580,753770,but also it has a different aspect for the show.
-mU7rEpAe10,753770,755850,"Yo, wait, wait, wait."
-mU7rEpAe10,755850,757839,"I can tell if I look super closely,"
-mU7rEpAe10,757840,760670,"it's not perfect scaling on the Game Boy Advance,"
-mU7rEpAe10,760670,763152,but it's still very sharp.
-mU7rEpAe10,763152,764870,(Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire music)
-mU7rEpAe10,764870,766448,And also sounds great too.
-mU7rEpAe10,766448,770615,(Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire music)
-mU7rEpAe10,775530,777600,"And the nice thing is if you're done playing for a minute,"
-mU7rEpAe10,777600,779009,"hit the button, it goes to sleep."
-mU7rEpAe10,779010,780520,You don't actually have to like restart your game
-mU7rEpAe10,780520,781353,or save or anything like that.
-mU7rEpAe10,781353,783150,All of you should always save your game.
-mU7rEpAe10,783150,784870,"Now at first, I was a little bit turned off"
-mU7rEpAe10,784870,786060,"by the idea that it's plastic,"
-mU7rEpAe10,786060,788190,"'cause I thought, like in all the images it looked metal,"
-mU7rEpAe10,788190,790820,"but the more I use it, it's a nice sturdy plastic."
-mU7rEpAe10,790820,793860,"It's a little bit matte, but also, it's a Game Boy."
-mU7rEpAe10,793860,795890,Kinda actually want it to be plastic I think.
-mU7rEpAe10,795890,796723,I had no more.
-mU7rEpAe10,796723,798650,"I kind of use it, like the buttons don't have"
-mU7rEpAe10,798650,800280,like some super high-end field.
-mU7rEpAe10,800280,802060,They're not like really tactile or clicky or anything.
-mU7rEpAe10,802060,803400,"Like they're still a little mushy,"
-mU7rEpAe10,803400,805210,but they're mushy in the exact same way
-mU7rEpAe10,805210,806070,that the Game Boy was.
-mU7rEpAe10,806070,808390,"In fact, I'd say they're actually slightly higher quality"
-mU7rEpAe10,808390,810110,than the kind of buttons you got on a Game Boy.
-mU7rEpAe10,810110,811339,"Jared, can you help me out here for a second."
-mU7rEpAe10,811340,812173,- [Jared] What's up?
-mU7rEpAe10,812173,814569,"- What are the ship times on this, on the website right now?"
-mU7rEpAe10,814570,818700,"- [Jared] Fulfillment group C, 2023."
-mU7rEpAe10,818700,819940,- [Ken] 23?
-mU7rEpAe10,819940,821410,- What are these going for on eBay?
-mU7rEpAe10,821410,825810,- I will sell a sponsorship on this channel
-mU7rEpAe10,825810,830779,to formally ask for one of these ahead of 2023.
-mU7rEpAe10,830780,832620,I don't even know if I'll make it to 2023.
-mU7rEpAe10,832620,833543,- You probably won't.
-mU7rEpAe10,833543,835040,(dramatic music)
-mU7rEpAe10,835040,836279,This isn't the end of the segment.
-mU7rEpAe10,836280,838075,I got more items.
-mU7rEpAe10,838075,838930,(Ken grunts)
-mU7rEpAe10,838930,840339,"We ain't done, son."
-mU7rEpAe10,840340,843670,This is not something that normally lands on Mystery Tech.
-mU7rEpAe10,843670,844503,Right?
-mU7rEpAe10,844503,846600,But I received something in the mail
-mU7rEpAe10,846600,847790,that I just have to share.
-mU7rEpAe10,847790,850279,Can you see this little Pokeball on the letter?
-mU7rEpAe10,850280,853070,"For Austin, from John P. Age 10,"
-mU7rEpAe10,853070,854530,please put in a wistery tech.
-mU7rEpAe10,854530,856400,"Well, this is Mystery Tech,"
-mU7rEpAe10,856400,857233,but how can I say no?
-mU7rEpAe10,857233,859029,You put a Pokeball on the front of it.
-mU7rEpAe10,860810,861720,Very excited.
-mU7rEpAe10,861720,862870,"Thank you, John,"
-mU7rEpAe10,862870,865920,for your kind contribution to this episode of Mystery Tech.
-mU7rEpAe10,865920,867500,Oh my goodness.
-mU7rEpAe10,867500,868900,Oh my goodness.
-mU7rEpAe10,868900,871350,Look at this.
-mU7rEpAe10,871350,874180,All right. So we've got ourselves a note here.
-mU7rEpAe10,874180,875500,"Dear Austin, first of all,"
-mU7rEpAe10,875500,878020,I love your videos and your podcast.
-mU7rEpAe10,878020,879240,"Shout out, John."
-mU7rEpAe10,879240,880073,- [Ken] He listens
-mU7rEpAe10,880073,881420,to the Test Drivers? - Listens to the podcast.
-mU7rEpAe10,881420,883709,- He has a $138 MSI graphics card.
-mU7rEpAe10,883710,886060,Also should I use 16 gigs of RAM?
-mU7rEpAe10,886060,887460,I hope you love what is in this envelope.
-mU7rEpAe10,887460,889670,"Your best subscriber, John, age 10."
-mU7rEpAe10,889670,891329,"P.S, please feature me a video."
-mU7rEpAe10,891330,892790,"Also if Ken wants one of these envelopes,"
-mU7rEpAe10,892790,893828,I can send him one.
-mU7rEpAe10,893828,894786,"(laughs) - [Ken] Oh,"
-mU7rEpAe10,894786,897920,"nevermind, I'm all happy now."
-mU7rEpAe10,897920,901300,"- John, I would say that a $130 MSI graphics card,"
-mU7rEpAe10,901300,902170,"probably a good idea,"
-mU7rEpAe10,902170,904410,because it's hard to get your hands on graphics cards.
-mU7rEpAe10,904410,907949,I'd be a little curious on which MSI graphics card it is.
