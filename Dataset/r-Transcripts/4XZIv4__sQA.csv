4XZIv4__sQA,178640,180400,source of income if you really want to
4XZIv4__sQA,180400,181920,increase the money coming in then
4XZIv4__sQA,181920,183840,consider other streams there are seven
4XZIv4__sQA,183840,185440,different types of income streams you
4XZIv4__sQA,185440,187200,should know earned income this is what
4XZIv4__sQA,187200,189200,we just talked about usually your 9 to 5
4XZIv4__sQA,189200,191040,job this type of income is the most
4XZIv4__sQA,191040,193120,common and usually a primary source of
4XZIv4__sQA,193120,195120,income but earned income is limited to
4XZIv4__sQA,195120,196640,the skills you have and the amount of
4XZIv4__sQA,196640,198159,time you can work a day then there's
4XZIv4__sQA,198159,199760,profit income this is when you sell a
4XZIv4__sQA,199760,201519,good or a service for more than what it
4XZIv4__sQA,201519,203120,costs you to produce this is your
4XZIv4__sQA,203120,205200,business owner or entrepreneur this kind
4XZIv4__sQA,205200,207200,of income is scalable and your earning
4XZIv4__sQA,207200,209200,potential is unlimited but with this
4XZIv4__sQA,209200,211280,reward there's much more risk if you
4XZIv4__sQA,211280,213040,don't want to take that risk then take a
4XZIv4__sQA,213040,214799,look at interest income this is when you
4XZIv4__sQA,214799,216480,get paid to lend out your money for
4XZIv4__sQA,216480,218640,example a high interest savings account
4XZIv4__sQA,218640,221440,bonds or gics now usually you need a lot
4XZIv4__sQA,221440,223120,of money to make a significant amount of
4XZIv4__sQA,223120,224959,interest income but the pros are that
4XZIv4__sQA,224959,227040,it's risk-free and it's very passive
4XZIv4__sQA,227040,228879,another passive way to earn income is
4XZIv4__sQA,228879,230720,through dividend income dividend income
4XZIv4__sQA,230720,232159,is income received for being a
4XZIv4__sQA,232159,233760,shareholder of a company all you need to
4XZIv4__sQA,233760,235920,do is buy shares of a company that pays
4XZIv4__sQA,235920,237840,a dividend and you'll receive a dividend
4XZIv4__sQA,237840,239680,payout usually quarterly the next type
4XZIv4__sQA,239680,241680,of income is rental income this is when
4XZIv4__sQA,241680,243360,you have an asset and let someone rent
4XZIv4__sQA,243360,245040,it for money this could be anything from
4XZIv4__sQA,245040,247760,a house to your car to equipment another
4XZIv4__sQA,247760,250080,type of income is capital gains this is
4XZIv4__sQA,250080,251760,when you buy an asset and sell it for
4XZIv4__sQA,251760,253200,more than what you bought it for two
4XZIv4__sQA,253200,255840,examples would be stocks or a house this
4XZIv4__sQA,255840,257759,is why investing in the stock market and
4XZIv4__sQA,257759,260160,in real estate is so popular and lastly
4XZIv4__sQA,260160,261759,royalty income this is the income
4XZIv4__sQA,261759,263680,received from allowing someone to use
4XZIv4__sQA,263680,265600,your property types of royalty income
4XZIv4__sQA,265600,269199,include music books pictures patents and
4XZIv4__sQA,269199,271360,even the use of a franchise this type of
4XZIv4__sQA,271360,273280,income source requires the work up front
4XZIv4__sQA,273280,275120,but usually once it's produced it can
4XZIv4__sQA,275120,277040,become passive the more of these seven
4XZIv4__sQA,277040,278720,income streams you have the more money
4XZIv4__sQA,278720,280400,you'll make if you happen to lose your
4XZIv4__sQA,280400,282000,job you wouldn't be screwed because you
4XZIv4__sQA,282000,283840,have other sources of income these seven
4XZIv4__sQA,283840,285840,income sources are either active income
4XZIv4__sQA,285840,288080,or passive income active income requires
4XZIv4__sQA,288080,290240,you to actively perform a service to get
4XZIv4__sQA,290240,292080,paid while passive income can make you
4XZIv4__sQA,292080,293680,money while you sleep there's only so
4XZIv4__sQA,293680,295520,much time in a day if you really want to
4XZIv4__sQA,295520,297199,grow your income you'll need income
4XZIv4__sQA,297199,299440,sources that pay more and require less
4XZIv4__sQA,299440,301360,time many of these income sources can be
4XZIv4__sQA,301360,303199,considered investing investing in a
4XZIv4__sQA,303199,304960,business that can pay you profit income
4XZIv4__sQA,304960,306560,investing in real estate that can pay
4XZIv4__sQA,306560,308960,you rental income or capital gains and
4XZIv4__sQA,308960,310720,investing in a stock market that can pay
4XZIv4__sQA,310720,312560,you dividend income and also capital
4XZIv4__sQA,312560,314639,gains so one essential part of financial
4XZIv4__sQA,314639,316960,literacy is investing one of the easiest
4XZIv4__sQA,316960,319600,barriers to entry in investing is in the
4XZIv4__sQA,319600,321199,stock market this is where a lot of
4XZIv4__sQA,321199,323759,wealth has been built by capital gains
4XZIv4__sQA,323759,325520,dividend income and the power of
4XZIv4__sQA,325520,327360,compounding two ways i suggest you
4XZIv4__sQA,327360,328880,invest in the stock market is
4XZIv4__sQA,328880,331120,self-directed investing or with a robo
4XZIv4__sQA,331120,333520,advisor self-directed or do-it-yourself
4XZIv4__sQA,333520,335440,investing is when you open a brokerage
4XZIv4__sQA,335440,337199,account and do the investing yourself
4XZIv4__sQA,337199,338880,before you pick a brokerage company to
4XZIv4__sQA,338880,340320,go with think about what kind of
4XZIv4__sQA,340320,342320,investor you are growth investor

4XZIv4__sQA,363520,365120,capital gains in this account are
4XZIv4__sQA,365120,366960,tax-free the catch is you could only
4XZIv4__sQA,366960,368720,contribute so much every year plus
4XZIv4__sQA,368720,370080,there's lots of other rules you'll need

4XZIv4__sQA,374319,376319,certain situations so you'll need to do
4XZIv4__sQA,376319,378639,some research before considering an rrsp
4XZIv4__sQA,378639,380560,account and your cash account is used

4XZIv4__sQA,392080,394479,should keep holding your stocks sell or
4XZIv4__sQA,394479,396319,buy more but if this is too much work
4XZIv4__sQA,396319,398160,and you just don't have the time you can
4XZIv4__sQA,398160,399680,invest with a robo-advisor with a
4XZIv4__sQA,399680,401440,robo-advisor all you need to do is

4XZIv4__sQA,549440,551360,you spend that's where budgeting comes
4XZIv4__sQA,551360,553360,in a budget is a spending plan for your
4XZIv4__sQA,553360,555279,money there's four main categories in a
4XZIv4__sQA,555279,558560,budget your needs your wants debts and
4XZIv4__sQA,558560,560880,savings slash investments there's many
4XZIv4__sQA,560880,562560,different budget templates out there and
4XZIv4__sQA,562560,563920,there's many different ways to track
4XZIv4__sQA,563920,565920,your budget one of the easiest ways is
4XZIv4__sQA,565920,567839,to do your spending on an account that
4XZIv4__sQA,567839,569920,has money managing and budgeting tools
4XZIv4__sQA,569920,571760,one of the best would be coho it's a

4XZIv4__sQA,574000,575839,tools to help you manage your money and
4XZIv4__sQA,575839,577920,most importantly save your money this
4XZIv4__sQA,577920,580000,video isn't sponsored by coho i just
4XZIv4__sQA,580000,581519,think they have the perfect product for
4XZIv4__sQA,581519,583040,people who struggle with managing their
4XZIv4__sQA,583040,584399,money once you start tracking your
4XZIv4__sQA,584399,585920,spending you can see where all your
4XZIv4__sQA,585920,587839,money goes so you can try and decrease
4XZIv4__sQA,587839,589519,these categories to increase your
4XZIv4__sQA,589519,591839,savings another sneaky but effective way
4XZIv4__sQA,591839,594160,to save money is to pay yourself first
4XZIv4__sQA,594160,595920,as soon as you get paid put money into
4XZIv4__sQA,595920,598399,savings then spend the rest if you do
4XZIv4__sQA,598399,600720,the opposite get paid spend money and
4XZIv4__sQA,600720,602399,save what you have left you might find
4XZIv4__sQA,602399,604560,yourself saving less so pay yourself
4XZIv4__sQA,604560,606240,first and if you happen to have money
4XZIv4__sQA,606240,608640,left after your spending save some more
4XZIv4__sQA,608640,610880,to make paying yourself first easier
4XZIv4__sQA,610880,612880,make it automatic set up your account so
4XZIv4__sQA,612880,614320,when you get paid money will
4XZIv4__sQA,614320,615760,automatically transfer from your
4XZIv4__sQA,615760,617920,checking to your savings and speaking of
4XZIv4__sQA,617920,619680,savings accounts you'll want to try and
4XZIv4__sQA,619680,621360,earn the best interest rate you can
4XZIv4__sQA,621360,623120,inflation in canada is around two
4XZIv4__sQA,623120,625200,percent annually meaning your 100
4XZIv4__sQA,625200,628000,dollars will have the buying power of 98
4XZIv4__sQA,628000,630320,after one year inflation is the cost of
4XZIv4__sQA,630320,632560,goods and services increasing year after
4XZIv4__sQA,632560,634560,year so everything gets more expensive
4XZIv4__sQA,634560,636160,so you'll want to try and earn a decent
4XZIv4__sQA,636160,638160,interest rate to counter this another
4XZIv4__sQA,638160,639839,thing you should consider is when to
4XZIv4__sQA,639839,642160,save and when to invest savings are
4XZIv4__sQA,642160,643839,reserved for emergency funds and
4XZIv4__sQA,643839,645839,short-term goals with any long-term
4XZIv4__sQA,645839,647920,goals like retirement or your children's
4XZIv4__sQA,647920,650000,education investing will be your better
4XZIv4__sQA,650000,652079,option because of better returns this is
4XZIv4__sQA,652079,654000,where risk tolerance comes in let's say
4XZIv4__sQA,654000,656000,you plan to buy a house if you can save
4XZIv4__sQA,656000,657839,for a house in two years this would be
4XZIv4__sQA,657839,659519,considered short term you wouldn't want
4XZIv4__sQA,659519,661760,the short-term savings goals invested
4XZIv4__sQA,661760,663760,because of short-term volatility now if
4XZIv4__sQA,663760,665760,you need five years to save for a house
4XZIv4__sQA,665760,667600,this would be considered long-term so
4XZIv4__sQA,667600,669120,it's more reasonable to have these
4XZIv4__sQA,669120,670880,savings invested because if anything
4XZIv4__sQA,670880,672480,happens in the stock market like a
4XZIv4__sQA,672480,674399,global pandemic you'll have time to
4XZIv4__sQA,674399,676720,recover so you don't incur a loss and as
4XZIv4__sQA,676720,678959,for emergency funds you'll want to first
4XZIv4__sQA,678959,682160,save for a 1 000 to 2 000 emergency fund
4XZIv4__sQA,682160,684560,then slowly build up a fund of 3 to 6
4XZIv4__sQA,684560,686640,months of living expenses the amount of
4XZIv4__sQA,686640,688720,your final emergency fund will depend on
4XZIv4__sQA,688720,690880,many factors like what line of work are
4XZIv4__sQA,690880,693120,you in how easy will it be to get a new
4XZIv4__sQA,693120,695120,job if you lose your current one how
4XZIv4__sQA,695120,697279,healthy you are you might be unable to
4XZIv4__sQA,697279,699279,work because of health complications how
4XZIv4__sQA,699279,701120,many dependents you have someone with
4XZIv4__sQA,701120,702560,five kids will need a way bigger
4XZIv4__sQA,702560,704399,emergency fund versus someone with no
4XZIv4__sQA,704399,706320,kids but don't get too carried away with
4XZIv4__sQA,706320,708640,your savings once again savings don't
4XZIv4__sQA,708640,710560,earn a whole lot and you will lose value
4XZIv4__sQA,710560,712320,due to inflation and make sure you're
4XZIv4__sQA,712320,714399,not saving just for the sake of saving
4XZIv4__sQA,714399,716560,have savings goals and have investing
4XZIv4__sQA,716560,718720,goals the next financial literacy lesson
4XZIv4__sQA,718720,721279,is what most people are good at spending
4XZIv4__sQA,721279,723360,sold to the gentleman who bought every
4XZIv4__sQA,723360,726720,item in today's auction
4XZIv4__sQA,727279,729200,well good in a bad way now you can't
4XZIv4__sQA,729200,731200,just save and only buy assets with your
4XZIv4__sQA,731200,733120,money you will also need to spend money
4XZIv4__sQA,733120,736160,to survive like housing transportation
4XZIv4__sQA,736160,738639,food clothing and whatnot so in this
4XZIv4__sQA,738639,741040,battle what's your weapon of choice cash
4XZIv4__sQA,741040,743920,a debit card a credit card or a prepaid
4XZIv4__sQA,743920,746320,mastercard or visa with cash you get the
4XZIv4__sQA,746320,748079,benefit of not getting yourself into
4XZIv4__sQA,748079,750240,debt once your cash is gone the spending
4XZIv4__sQA,750240,752720,stops cash is also good to use when
4XZIv4__sQA,752720,754959,buying and selling in classified ads for
4XZIv4__sQA,754959,757600,cash discounts tipping cash-only
4XZIv4__sQA,757600,760480,emergencies and when using cash studies
4XZIv4__sQA,760480,762480,show that you'll likely spend less for
4XZIv4__sQA,762480,764560,the cons cash is harder the track for
4XZIv4__sQA,764560,766399,budgeting there's a chance of losing it
4XZIv4__sQA,766399,768000,and you might get robbed and you won't
4XZIv4__sQA,768000,770000,be able to make certain purchases like
4XZIv4__sQA,770000,771920,online purchases pre-authorized
4XZIv4__sQA,771920,774480,purchases pay bills and somewhere where
4XZIv4__sQA,774480,776480,only mastercard and visa is accepted
4XZIv4__sQA,776480,777839,what about keeping your money in a
4XZIv4__sQA,777839,779680,checking account and using a debit card
4XZIv4__sQA,779680,782160,pros no need to carry cash if it gets
4XZIv4__sQA,782160,783920,lost or stolen you can just cancel the
4XZIv4__sQA,783920,785760,card you can send and receive
4XZIv4__sQA,785760,788079,e-transfers you have budgeting tools
4XZIv4__sQA,788079,790480,mobile check deposit ability to withdraw
4XZIv4__sQA,790480,793360,cash at any atm overdraft protection and
4XZIv4__sQA,793360,795680,set up payroll direct deposit cons with
4XZIv4__sQA,795680,797440,the big banks you'll be paying a monthly
4XZIv4__sQA,797440,799120,fee unless you maintain a certain
4XZIv4__sQA,799120,800959,balance you can get a weight plus with a
4XZIv4__sQA,800959,802639,checking account there's many other fees
4XZIv4__sQA,802639,804079,you need to worry about but with that
4XZIv4__sQA,804079,805839,being said there's many banks out there
4XZIv4__sQA,805839,808000,that offer no fee checking accounts like
4XZIv4__sQA,808000,810560,tangerine simply and modus bank another
4XZIv4__sQA,810560,812399,con is that using a debit card won't
4XZIv4__sQA,812399,813920,help you build credit if you want to
4XZIv4__sQA,813920,815680,build credit you'll need a credit card
4XZIv4__sQA,815680,817440,with a credit card you get the ability
4XZIv4__sQA,817440,819440,to borrow money doing this properly is
4XZIv4__sQA,819440,820800,one of the best ways to build your
4XZIv4__sQA,820800,822240,credit but with getting a credit card
4XZIv4__sQA,822240,823920,you'll need to understand a few things
4XZIv4__sQA,823920,825600,what's your annual interest rate what's
4XZIv4__sQA,825600,827680,your grace period interest rates for
4XZIv4__sQA,827680,829680,late payments and cash advances and
4XZIv4__sQA,829680,831839,foreign exchange fees pros of using a
4XZIv4__sQA,831839,833519,credit card is you get benefits that
4XZIv4__sQA,833519,835120,range from purchase protection and
4XZIv4__sQA,835120,837360,extended warranty to airport lounge
4XZIv4__sQA,837360,839839,access and free roadside assistance also
4XZIv4__sQA,839839,841600,most credit cards will offer you cash
4XZIv4__sQA,841600,843920,back or reward points and another pro of
4XZIv4__sQA,843920,845519,a credit card is that you're protected
4XZIv4__sQA,845519,847279,under a zero liability protection
4XZIv4__sQA,847279,849519,program cons of a credit card include
4XZIv4__sQA,849519,851760,interest and other fees interest on a
4XZIv4__sQA,851760,853360,credit card is usually around twenty
4XZIv4__sQA,853360,855040,percent this is why it's important to
4XZIv4__sQA,855040,856480,pay off your credit card before you get
4XZIv4__sQA,856480,858480,charged interest one of the biggest cons
4XZIv4__sQA,858480,860000,of a credit card is getting yourself
4XZIv4__sQA,860000,861519,into credit card debt when you don't
4XZIv4__sQA,861519,863279,track your spending this could be easily
4XZIv4__sQA,863279,865279,done without you even realizing it you
4XZIv4__sQA,865279,866959,should only use credit cards for two
4XZIv4__sQA,866959,869120,reasons to build your credit or take
4XZIv4__sQA,869120,871120,advantage of rewards and benefits if
4XZIv4__sQA,871120,872800,you're trying to build credit make a few
4XZIv4__sQA,872800,874720,purchases every month and pay off the
4XZIv4__sQA,874720,876320,balance right away if you tend to
4XZIv4__sQA,876320,878000,overspend and you can't pay off your
4XZIv4__sQA,878000,879760,full balance every month maybe credit
4XZIv4__sQA,879760,881600,cards aren't for you another spending
4XZIv4__sQA,881600,883600,option is a reloadable prepaid
4XZIv4__sQA,883600,885920,mastercard or visa these will be cards
4XZIv4__sQA,885920,889040,like coho stack mogo and a pc money
4XZIv4__sQA,889040,890880,account these kinds of accounts have no
4XZIv4__sQA,890880,892959,monthly fees and are limited on the fees
4XZIv4__sQA,892959,895120,they do charge they offer you budgeting
4XZIv4__sQA,895120,896800,and money management tools to help you
4XZIv4__sQA,896800,898959,spend less and a card like coho will
4XZIv4__sQA,898959,900880,even offer you cash back like a credit
4XZIv4__sQA,900880,902880,card and coming soon to coho will be
4XZIv4__sQA,902880,904800,coho save where instead of paying
4XZIv4__sQA,904800,906320,interest with a credit card you could
4XZIv4__sQA,906320,908560,earn an interest on your balance also
4XZIv4__sQA,908560,910399,since these cards are mastercard and
4XZIv4__sQA,910399,912880,visa you get their benefits the con with
4XZIv4__sQA,912880,914480,these cards is that they won't help you
4XZIv4__sQA,914480,916000,build credit but if you're not trying to
4XZIv4__sQA,916000,917920,get yourself into credit card debt this
4XZIv4__sQA,917920,919600,might be a good thing but the thing is
4XZIv4__sQA,919600,921600,your credit is another important part of
4XZIv4__sQA,921600,923600,financial literacy having a good credit
4XZIv4__sQA,923600,925519,report and credit score will allow you
4XZIv4__sQA,925519,927600,to get better credit cards and loans
4XZIv4__sQA,927600,929920,with better terms and interest rates so
4XZIv4__sQA,929920,931680,why is this important well there's two
4XZIv4__sQA,931680,933680,types of debt out there good debt and
4XZIv4__sQA,933680,936160,bad debt bad debt is your car loans
4XZIv4__sQA,936160,938320,credit cards or any kind of debt that
4XZIv4__sQA,938320,939920,doesn't pay you back what you put in
4XZIv4__sQA,939920,941519,good debt on the other hand is something
4XZIv4__sQA,941519,943839,that will pay off like a student loan a
4XZIv4__sQA,943839,946160,business loan or a mortgage that can be
4XZIv4__sQA,946160,947600,a tool that can ruin your life
4XZIv4__sQA,947600,949759,financially or if used properly it could
4XZIv4__sQA,949759,951680,be a tool to help you build your wealth
4XZIv4__sQA,951680,953519,this investment strategy is called
