V1ksYBG2jLs,80,3280,uh owning bitcoin though talk to us a
V1ksYBG2jLs,3280,5440,little bit more about that uh as a hedge
V1ksYBG2jLs,5440,6480,against
V1ksYBG2jLs,6480,8800,uh you know the calamity of war as a
V1ksYBG2jLs,8800,12160,hedge against uh 40-year high inflation
V1ksYBG2jLs,12160,14639,you are still maintaining it is better
V1ksYBG2jLs,14639,16400,than gold even better than owning real
V1ksYBG2jLs,16400,18160,estate
V1ksYBG2jLs,18160,20880,yeah bitcoin is two things um first of
V1ksYBG2jLs,20880,23439,all it's a non-sovereign store of value
V1ksYBG2jLs,23439,26560,asset so it's it's like a digital gold
V1ksYBG2jLs,26560,28720,but you can't make any more of it and
V1ksYBG2jLs,28720,30880,you can move it at the speed of light
V1ksYBG2jLs,30880,33360,and you can program it on a computer
V1ksYBG2jLs,33360,36079,and and so that makes it interesting to
V1ksYBG2jLs,36079,38480,people that would be gold bugs but it's
V1ksYBG2jLs,38480,41520,also an open monetary network so i can
V1ksYBG2jLs,41520,43760,move a billion dollars from here to
V1ksYBG2jLs,43760,46559,tokyo and back again every hour and i
V1ksYBG2jLs,46559,48640,can't do that with gold and so that
V1ksYBG2jLs,48640,50320,makes it very interesting to big tech
V1ksYBG2jLs,50320,51680,investors
V1ksYBG2jLs,51680,52480,so
V1ksYBG2jLs,52480,54320,we actually think in a world where it's
V1ksYBG2jLs,54320,56320,very difficult to move physical things
V1ksYBG2jLs,56320,58320,around it's hard to ship things on
V1ksYBG2jLs,58320,60160,container ships or fly them around in
V1ksYBG2jLs,60160,63120,airplanes and supply chains are snarled
V1ksYBG2jLs,63120,65600,in that world what you'd like is a pure
V1ksYBG2jLs,65600,68720,block of digital energy that moves on a
V1ksYBG2jLs,68720,71600,on a digital or a big tech network at
V1ksYBG2jLs,71600,72960,the speed of light
V1ksYBG2jLs,72960,74960,and so bitcoin kind of represents the
V1ksYBG2jLs,74960,76880,best of both worlds it's an it's an
V1ksYBG2jLs,76880,78799,inflation hedge because you can't make
V1ksYBG2jLs,78799,81200,any more of it it's a store of value but
V1ksYBG2jLs,81200,82560,it's also
V1ksYBG2jLs,82560,85280,a big tech dominant
V1ksYBG2jLs,85280,86880,digital network
V1ksYBG2jLs,86880,90960,like google or like apple or like uh
V1ksYBG2jLs,90960,92560,like facebook and of course those have
V1ksYBG2jLs,92560,95200,done very well in the past decade
V1ksYBG2jLs,95200,96799,but michael if we were just speaking
V1ksYBG2jLs,96799,99040,specifically about bitcoin we mentioned
V1ksYBG2jLs,99040,100799,comparatives to gold comparatives to
V1ksYBG2jLs,100799,103520,property it really all drills down to
V1ksYBG2jLs,103520,106079,price discovery or how much people are
V1ksYBG2jLs,106079,108159,willing to have its implied value be
V1ksYBG2jLs,108159,110240,worth because even with scarcity if
V1ksYBG2jLs,110240,112000,people don't invest in it it's obviously
V1ksYBG2jLs,112000,114159,going to be appreciative in value so the
V1ksYBG2jLs,114159,116479,problem being with all of this leverage
V1ksYBG2jLs,116479,118000,that is currently within the system that
V1ksYBG2jLs,118000,120399,is attached to bitcoin at the moment
V1ksYBG2jLs,120399,122640,isn't that a risk that you need to wipe
V1ksYBG2jLs,122640,125040,out the leverage to have adequate price
V1ksYBG2jLs,125040,126799,discovery more legitimate price
V1ksYBG2jLs,126799,128319,discovery when it does come to the price
V1ksYBG2jLs,128319,130239,of this asset because it was incredibly
V1ksYBG2jLs,130239,131599,over inflated over the course of the
V1ksYBG2jLs,131599,133599,last 18 months
V1ksYBG2jLs,133599,135040,yeah i mean i think you put your finger
V1ksYBG2jLs,135040,138000,on it uh i the two big uh liabilities
V1ksYBG2jLs,138000,139920,that bitcoin has been struggling against
V1ksYBG2jLs,139920,142160,are the fact that it's been trading on a
V1ksYBG2jLs,142160,144560,bunch of different unregulated exchanges
V1ksYBG2jLs,144560,146879,they could have up to 20 x leverage or
V1ksYBG2jLs,146879,148560,100x leverage
V1ksYBG2jLs,148560,150200,and the fact that it was
V1ksYBG2jLs,150200,152480,cross-collateralized with 19
V1ksYBG2jLs,152480,154879,500 other cryptos
V1ksYBG2jLs,154879,157519,many of them are unregistered securities
V1ksYBG2jLs,157519,159760,a lot of them are very opaque
V1ksYBG2jLs,159760,161599,and and so
V1ksYBG2jLs,161599,164800,when you have uh lots of other assets
V1ksYBG2jLs,164800,166640,that are being traded on a saturday
V1ksYBG2jLs,166640,168879,afternoon with leverage that are either
V1ksYBG2jLs,168879,171599,being uh they're being lent to buy and
V1ksYBG2jLs,171599,173920,sell bitcoin or bitcoin is being pledged
V1ksYBG2jLs,173920,175920,to buy or sell these other things with
V1ksYBG2jLs,175920,177760,20x leverage you're going to get
V1ksYBG2jLs,177760,179840,volatility um
V1ksYBG2jLs,179840,182800,the industry's maturing right now and uh
V1ksYBG2jLs,182800,185840,as it matures and it shakes uh shakes
V1ksYBG2jLs,185840,188640,out this leverage and as we get clarity
V1ksYBG2jLs,188640,190319,between what's a commodity and what's
V1ksYBG2jLs,190319,192480,the security and as these exchanges get
V1ksYBG2jLs,192480,193840,regulated
V1ksYBG2jLs,193840,195360,i think that the trading leverage
V1ksYBG2jLs,195360,198560,disappears and the opacity disappears
V1ksYBG2jLs,198560,199360,and
V1ksYBG2jLs,199360,201440,you can already see right now the
V1ksYBG2jLs,201440,204080,volatility is decreasing year by year
V1ksYBG2jLs,204080,206640,and quarter by quarter in this asset as
V1ksYBG2jLs,206640,207840,it matures
