STgA3dYavBQ,6480,8400,consumer and today we're going to be
STgA3dYavBQ,8400,10240,checking out my favorite tech that i've
STgA3dYavBQ,10240,13360,been using for the past month now last
STgA3dYavBQ,13360,15679,time we had the entire team involved
STgA3dYavBQ,15679,17279,that was great a lot of you guys liked
STgA3dYavBQ,17279,18000,it
STgA3dYavBQ,18000,19199,i don't know if these guys will be able
STgA3dYavBQ,19199,21439,to keep up with one of these videos
STgA3dYavBQ,21439,23600,every month so you guys are stuck with
STgA3dYavBQ,23600,25119,me for a little bit they'll be back at
STgA3dYavBQ,25119,26960,some point but today we're gonna find
STgA3dYavBQ,26960,28080,out some of the stuff that i've been
STgA3dYavBQ,28080,29679,using personally i got some stuff that
STgA3dYavBQ,29679,31599,i've really been enjoying but before we
STgA3dYavBQ,31599,32880,jump into that we gotta give a huge
STgA3dYavBQ,32880,34719,shout out to today's sponsor
STgA3dYavBQ,34719,37760,lark so check it out guys this is the
STgA3dYavBQ,37760,40079,lark pitcher pureviz now you might be
STgA3dYavBQ,40079,41680,looking at this and wondering what kind
STgA3dYavBQ,41680,44320,of tech can a water pitcher have well we
STgA3dYavBQ,44320,46160,all know about the typical filtration
STgA3dYavBQ,46160,48160,systems that water pitchers use well if
STgA3dYavBQ,48160,49280,you actually think about it those
STgA3dYavBQ,49280,50879,filtration systems remove pollutants
STgA3dYavBQ,50879,53280,from water but they also hold on to them
STgA3dYavBQ,53280,55120,and after about two weeks it's
STgA3dYavBQ,55120,57039,recontaminating the water that's where
STgA3dYavBQ,57039,58960,the pureviz tech comes in on the lark
STgA3dYavBQ,58960,60399,pitcher it's got two steps with
STgA3dYavBQ,60399,63760,filtration and purification using uvc
STgA3dYavBQ,63760,66479,led tech that purifies water by
STgA3dYavBQ,66479,69439,deactivating biocontaminants at the
STgA3dYavBQ,69439,71360,molecular level and what's cool is that
STgA3dYavBQ,71360,73680,the purification happens automatically
STgA3dYavBQ,73680,74960,so you don't have to think about
STgA3dYavBQ,74960,76560,actively cleaning it one of my biggest
STgA3dYavBQ,76560,78479,problem with pitchers that have filters
STgA3dYavBQ,78479,80720,was always the upkeep but with lark's
STgA3dYavBQ,80720,82560,plant-based filter and pureviz tech
STgA3dYavBQ,82560,84479,staying on top of those contaminants you
STgA3dYavBQ,84479,86640,can go longer without needing to change
STgA3dYavBQ,86640,88400,anything and with this thing being a
STgA3dYavBQ,88400,90640,smart picture with tech inside of course
STgA3dYavBQ,90640,92560,it has an app where you can track things
STgA3dYavBQ,92560,94479,like water intake and then some so if
STgA3dYavBQ,94479,95600,you guys want to learn more about the
STgA3dYavBQ,95600,97439,lark pitcher and some of the cool tech

STgA3dYavBQ,156560,158800,able to travel with these and on the
STgA3dYavBQ,158800,161360,plane it's usually a goal of mine to
STgA3dYavBQ,161360,164000,just block everything out and try and
STgA3dYavBQ,164000,166879,fall asleep before the plane takes off
STgA3dYavBQ,166879,168160,with this
STgA3dYavBQ,168160,169840,not an issue i threw it on immediately

STgA3dYavBQ,194480,196080,apple has the best
STgA3dYavBQ,196080,199280,transparency mode out of any brand right
STgA3dYavBQ,199280,201440,now apple for some reason they they just
STgA3dYavBQ,201440,203360,got that down but i just feel like this

STgA3dYavBQ,205680,208560,i've been really enjoying these i do
STgA3dYavBQ,208560,211440,really wish that they could fold

STgA3dYavBQ,272880,274160,this
STgA3dYavBQ,274160,276000,from the last
STgA3dYavBQ,276000,278320,it's from the massive tech unboxing that
STgA3dYavBQ,278320,280000,never saw the light of day we're not
STgA3dYavBQ,280000,281520,gonna talk we're not gonna talk about
STgA3dYavBQ,281520,283280,that jay
STgA3dYavBQ,283280,285759,the lost episode but right here guys
STgA3dYavBQ,285759,289360,this thing is called the couch console
STgA3dYavBQ,289360,291440,so this is basically supposed to be i
STgA3dYavBQ,291440,293040,don't know like your best buddy when
STgA3dYavBQ,293040,294960,you're chilling on the couch and you're
STgA3dYavBQ,294960,297199,just playing games
STgA3dYavBQ,297199,299280,watching tv you might be wondering like
STgA3dYavBQ,299280,301759,judd what the heck is this thing what
STgA3dYavBQ,301759,303759,are we looking at right i'm not even
STgA3dYavBQ,303759,306000,sure what you call it but you've got
STgA3dYavBQ,306000,308960,like this tray of sorts you can have a
STgA3dYavBQ,308960,311120,drink right here and it's got this like
STgA3dYavBQ,311120,314320,really cool design that no matter how
STgA3dYavBQ,314320,316720,this thing is oriented on the couch if
STgA3dYavBQ,316720,318160,you bump into it
STgA3dYavBQ,318160,319759,it should be able to keep your drink
STgA3dYavBQ,319759,321840,upright so you don't have to worry about
STgA3dYavBQ,321840,324720,spills can we get a cup i got to show
STgA3dYavBQ,324720,326400,you guys so you just throw it in here
STgA3dYavBQ,326400,328320,this obviously has a cover
STgA3dYavBQ,328320,330960,but you guys can see as you tilt it it's
STgA3dYavBQ,330960,333199,staying upright the entire time it also
STgA3dYavBQ,333199,335360,has these other compartments so if you
STgA3dYavBQ,335360,337360,want to throw in i don't know like some
STgA3dYavBQ,337360,339759,chips or some kind of snack in here you
STgA3dYavBQ,339759,343440,can do that it even has like this
STgA3dYavBQ,343440,345440,little spacer it's they call it the
STgA3dYavBQ,345440,347280,couch cushion spacer
STgA3dYavBQ,347280,349759,but you can use this thing as a lid
STgA3dYavBQ,349759,351120,so when you're not when you're done
STgA3dYavBQ,351120,352479,snacking or something you can just kind
STgA3dYavBQ,352479,354240,of throw that on top
STgA3dYavBQ,354240,356319,remove it yes
STgA3dYavBQ,356319,358639,you can just kind of enjoy yourself but
STgA3dYavBQ,358639,359840,here's one thing you might not have
STgA3dYavBQ,359840,361120,noticed
STgA3dYavBQ,361120,363919,you see it's got a usb c port
STgA3dYavBQ,363919,366319,and that's because under this guy you
STgA3dYavBQ,366319,368800,actually have a spot for a portable
STgA3dYavBQ,368800,371199,charger or anything else that you want
STgA3dYavBQ,371199,374080,to keep nearby so this also acts as
STgA3dYavBQ,374080,377440,a storage compartment for your couch now
STgA3dYavBQ,377440,379440,i think this is really cool because
STgA3dYavBQ,379440,381280,obviously there's at least a little bit
STgA3dYavBQ,381280,383360,of tech involved here so if you've got
STgA3dYavBQ,383360,385280,that here
STgA3dYavBQ,385280,386880,maybe you've got your phone right here
STgA3dYavBQ,386880,389360,on the other side you can just plug in
STgA3dYavBQ,389360,391600,have your phone charging even maybe
STgA3dYavBQ,391600,393680,watch some content i don't know but
STgA3dYavBQ,393680,395120,you've got the ability to do that i
STgA3dYavBQ,395120,396479,think that's pretty dope and if you're
STgA3dYavBQ,396479,398880,not using this little thing to hold up a
STgA3dYavBQ,398880,401120,phone or something you can actually just
STgA3dYavBQ,401120,403759,flip it over completely
STgA3dYavBQ,403759,405199,pop it here
STgA3dYavBQ,405199,406639,and it becomes like a
STgA3dYavBQ,406639,408400,little arm rest for you it's got like
STgA3dYavBQ,408400,409520,this nice
STgA3dYavBQ,409520,411520,soft material you're watching whatever's
STgA3dYavBQ,411520,413039,on your tv
STgA3dYavBQ,413039,414880,your drinks not spilling
STgA3dYavBQ,414880,417199,you're living large man this is this is
STgA3dYavBQ,417199,420000,really cool i i think this is awesome i

STgA3dYavBQ,428720,430560,now we're gonna move on to something a
STgA3dYavBQ,430560,433039,little something that's very very new to
STgA3dYavBQ,433039,436479,me uh and that's actually in here
STgA3dYavBQ,436479,438639,let's see
STgA3dYavBQ,438639,440880,so we've got right here
STgA3dYavBQ,440880,443919,is this guy the paper tablet
STgA3dYavBQ,443919,446080,the remarkable two
STgA3dYavBQ,446080,447680,now you guys might have seen me just
STgA3dYavBQ,447680,450000,unbox this in the recent massive tech
STgA3dYavBQ,450000,451919,unboxing if you guys haven't seen that
STgA3dYavBQ,451919,453440,video i'll of course have it linked down
STgA3dYavBQ,453440,455440,below as well
STgA3dYavBQ,455440,456800,but you know
STgA3dYavBQ,456800,458880,i got made fun of of course you guys
STgA3dYavBQ,458880,460880,know me kind of old school still like to
STgA3dYavBQ,460880,462400,walk around with
STgA3dYavBQ,462400,463680,a pen
STgA3dYavBQ,463680,467840,old school day jay at my place of work
STgA3dYavBQ,467840,469360,oh
STgA3dYavBQ,469360,472160,fine i guess i don't got to have it but
STgA3dYavBQ,472160,474879,i thought i did for having a paper and
STgA3dYavBQ,474879,475680,pen
STgA3dYavBQ,475680,479280,on me at all times no jay i'm hurt you
STgA3dYavBQ,479280,481199,can't take it back now the ball just
STgA3dYavBQ,481199,483919,decide this is something that
STgA3dYavBQ,483919,485759,i probably should have had a long time
STgA3dYavBQ,485759,487440,ago i find myself buying that kind of
STgA3dYavBQ,487440,489599,stationary like notebooks and pens just
STgA3dYavBQ,489599,491680,so i could jot my ideas down i like
STgA3dYavBQ,491680,492800,getting
STgA3dYavBQ,492800,494479,a new one whenever i want i really want
STgA3dYavBQ,494479,497039,to get inspired and feel creative again
STgA3dYavBQ,497039,498479,and i don't have to do that anymore that
STgA3dYavBQ,498479,499599,is like just
STgA3dYavBQ,499599,501840,completely
STgA3dYavBQ,501840,503599,that's completely gone for me but with
STgA3dYavBQ,503599,504400,this
STgA3dYavBQ,504400,507199,you pretty much have access to a paper
STgA3dYavBQ,507199,509759,tablet it doesn't function like your
STgA3dYavBQ,509759,511039,typical
STgA3dYavBQ,511039,513360,ipad uh it doesn't have like a backlight
STgA3dYavBQ,513360,517518,it feels like paper so you can just
STgA3dYavBQ,517599,518560,write
STgA3dYavBQ,518560,519440,as
STgA3dYavBQ,519440,520599,you
STgA3dYavBQ,520599,522880,[Music]
STgA3dYavBQ,522880,524720,please i like the idea of getting tech
STgA3dYavBQ,524720,526480,involved with something that's pretty
STgA3dYavBQ,526480,528399,old school like i miss being able to
STgA3dYavBQ,528399,530480,write things out i feel like i'm way
STgA3dYavBQ,530480,533600,more creative when i'm actually writing
STgA3dYavBQ,533600,535760,and it doesn't feel the same writing on
STgA3dYavBQ,535760,538560,something like an ipad whereas with this
STgA3dYavBQ,538560,540880,it does feel a bit more natural like
STgA3dYavBQ,540880,543519,you're really writing on paper uh it's
STgA3dYavBQ,543519,544399,just a
STgA3dYavBQ,544399,546880,nicer experience and it fills the void
STgA3dYavBQ,546880,549600,of not having that notebook in here

STgA3dYavBQ,627839,630240,can't say i recommend you go out and get
STgA3dYavBQ,630240,632240,something like this because it's really
STgA3dYavBQ,632240,634240,expensive i know this uh but it's the
STgA3dYavBQ,634240,637519,canon r5 so the r5
STgA3dYavBQ,637519,639600,has been their best mirrorless camera
STgA3dYavBQ,639600,642079,for a while now how long ago did they
STgA3dYavBQ,642079,643839,release this jay
STgA3dYavBQ,643839,645680,was it just 20 20
STgA3dYavBQ,645680,648800,july 2020 yes all right jay go ahead go
STgA3dYavBQ,648800,651519,ahead jay but yeah i've been
STgA3dYavBQ,651519,653839,loving this thing this camera is a beast
STgA3dYavBQ,653839,655600,when it comes to the specs it's got it
STgA3dYavBQ,655600,657360,all you've got you can shoot an ak you
STgA3dYavBQ,657360,659600,can shoot really great 4k
STgA3dYavBQ,659600,661440,got slow motion i think you can do 4k
STgA3dYavBQ,661440,663519,120.
STgA3dYavBQ,663519,664880,you can do all the things with this
STgA3dYavBQ,664880,666880,camera but the image quality that you
STgA3dYavBQ,666880,669040,get out of this has just been
STgA3dYavBQ,669040,670720,really awesome now for our youtube
STgA3dYavBQ,670720,673360,videos we use like the sony
STgA3dYavBQ,673360,677440,a7s uh mark threes absolutely love but
STgA3dYavBQ,677440,679839,this i feel like for a as a personal
STgA3dYavBQ,679839,682480,camera i just been really enjoying the
STgA3dYavBQ,682480,684480,style of canon canon has really great
STgA3dYavBQ,684480,686640,color science uh that's always just been
STgA3dYavBQ,686640,688079,their thing
STgA3dYavBQ,688079,690240,but i'm really liking what they did with
STgA3dYavBQ,690240,692399,the lenses the rf lenses i think are
STgA3dYavBQ,692399,694399,really dope not only are they really
STgA3dYavBQ,694399,696240,fast when it comes to autofocusing and
STgA3dYavBQ,696240,698399,really silent but they've got like this
STgA3dYavBQ,698399,700160,extra ring right here that gives you
STgA3dYavBQ,700160,703040,control over your image so for me
STgA3dYavBQ,703040,705920,personally i've got this set to
STgA3dYavBQ,705920,709600,like my iso so i can just change my iso
STgA3dYavBQ,709600,711760,by turning the lens here so now this is
STgA3dYavBQ,711760,714639,way overexposed for me i'm taking lots
STgA3dYavBQ,714639,717200,of photos of my family
STgA3dYavBQ,717200,718800,doing some video stuff here and there
STgA3dYavBQ,718800,720399,taking photos of like
STgA3dYavBQ,720399,723200,tech products so for me it's a hybrid
STgA3dYavBQ,723200,727959,camera where i needed to do everything
STgA3dYavBQ,730160,732240,that's a really good point jay so we
STgA3dYavBQ,732240,734240,actually took this over to
STgA3dYavBQ,734240,736320,hawaii when we were shooting something
STgA3dYavBQ,736320,739120,with uh i think snapdragon
STgA3dYavBQ,739120,741120,i used this to shoot which surprisingly
STgA3dYavBQ,741120,742800,it didn't overheat on me which is like a
STgA3dYavBQ,742800,745040,big concern like there was
STgA3dYavBQ,745040,747600,in the sun i was baking in the sun you
STgA3dYavBQ,747600,749279,see i i was probably sweating in that
STgA3dYavBQ,749279,751920,video but like with what jay said i
STgA3dYavBQ,751920,753920,didn't have to do much grading like the
STgA3dYavBQ,753920,756399,image right out of the camera was good
STgA3dYavBQ,756399,758720,enough to upload straight to youtube so
STgA3dYavBQ,758720,760320,that's one of the great things about
STgA3dYavBQ,760320,761920,canon but either way canon ain't
STgA3dYavBQ,761920,764079,sponsoring this video so don't
STgA3dYavBQ,764079,765360,don't buy candy if you don't want i
STgA3dYavBQ,765360,767040,don't care i'm just saying what i like
STgA3dYavBQ,767040,768880,so that about wraps it up for this video
