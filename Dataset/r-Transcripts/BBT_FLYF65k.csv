BBT_FLYF65k,293120,299280,on top of them all this is like the  wrapper this is what holds everything  this is like the main hearty thing we're  eating and this is the flavor salsas of

BBT_FLYF65k,322160,328639,mexico on instagram she's the perfect  person to share a table with as i dip my  toe into the world of mexican cuisine
BBT_FLYF65k,328639,334080,most americans including myself have  kind of a limited idea of what mexican  food is most of the mexican food we eat
BBT_FLYF65k,334080,339360,in the usa is like tex-mex it's a  mixture between the northern third of  mexico and the southern fruit of the
BBT_FLYF65k,339360,346160,united states but mexico is a white  country  when it comes to local food mexico is
BBT_FLYF65k,346160,352720,divided into seven regions you'll find  the best cattle in the north spanish  influence dishes in the bajio delicious
BBT_FLYF65k,352720,359280,seafood on the north pacific coast or  the gulf and the southern areas offer  more long-held indigenous recipes mexico
BBT_FLYF65k,359280,364880,city's central location means it's  inherited the best of flavors from  around the country that includes
BBT_FLYF65k,364880,370080,chicharron and salsa verde  this is a typical food from the center
BBT_FLYF65k,370080,375840,these are pork rinds with salsa verde  they heat lard in a clay pot over a  charcoal grill throw in some onion and a
BBT_FLYF65k,375840,384800,generous portion of salsa verde is one  of the most common salsas in mexico with  jalapeno lime cilantro and tomatillos
BBT_FLYF65k,386400,393199,next add in smaller portions of  chicharron and let the pot simmer for 15  minutes  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,393199,399759,i always like to start with a little  square those are large wow  it's like a diamond cut piece of skin
BBT_FLYF65k,399759,405360,with a bunch of lard and fat attached  it's really beautiful i should have  proposed to my wife with this
BBT_FLYF65k,405360,411360,my jokes are not landing in  mexico well it's really interesting the  fat is pretty gooey and slippery kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,411360,416720,slides down your throat and then that  little piece of skin is actually a  little harder to chew through it's kind  of tough it just seems like every bite
BBT_FLYF65k,416720,422080,has a little bit different texture right  wait hold on you put this in a tortilla  too yeah can everything go in a tortilla
BBT_FLYF65k,422080,428639,everything what about cheesecake uh to  mexicans tortillas make the meal a  typical mexican family of four consumes
BBT_FLYF65k,428639,433680,more than two pounds of tortillas a day  that is fascinating this is real wet and
BBT_FLYF65k,433680,439360,spongy inside for me this salsa is  giving life to everything this is a  fantastic start we have a lot more food
BBT_FLYF65k,439360,444880,to try today are you still hungry not  right now but i'm gonna be all right  let's do it
BBT_FLYF65k,447039,454080,there's a saying in mexico no corn no  country corn was domesticated by the  mayans long long ago and it's been
BBT_FLYF65k,454080,460319,inextricably tied to the lives of  mexican people ever since it shapes  daily meals it inspires architects its
BBT_FLYF65k,460319,465840,growing cycle even influences the time  of festivals today 59 native species of
BBT_FLYF65k,465840,472319,corn take part in over 600 mexican  dishes from everyday items like  tortillas to the ceremonial dish we're
BBT_FLYF65k,472319,477759,about to try next onions lime sour cream  is this a regular  more
BBT_FLYF65k,477759,484400,oh my gosh wait all this is going to go  in the soup yes this is a food called  posole
BBT_FLYF65k,484400,491120,the word pizzole rings in most mexicans  ears with a note of nostalgia conjuring  memories of family reunions and special
BBT_FLYF65k,491120,497759,events this dish stands out for many  reasons but this meal still starts with  the soup itself it's green and then is
BBT_FLYF65k,497759,503280,this chicken or beef this is pork  nailed it a dish that's not easy to nail
BBT_FLYF65k,503280,509440,but here at los de lucos they've been  making it for 40 years it starts with a  pig head simmering for hours until it
BBT_FLYF65k,509440,516800,becomes tender this creates the base for  the broth  in the meantime prepare the hominy
BBT_FLYF65k,516800,523039,hominy is a signature of mexican cuisine  corn kernels that are soaked in lime or  lye to eliminate the grain's coating
BBT_FLYF65k,523039,529680,this also makes it less fibrous and  easier to digest for the puzzle each of  the stems is removed by hand one
BBT_FLYF65k,529680,534200,painstaking kernel at a time
BBT_FLYF65k,537120,543200,that's what these guys are doing  it takes 12 hours to simmer the hominy  in the bra so they usually leave it
BBT_FLYF65k,543200,553029,overnight  and the pork is added in the morning  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,553279,561200,enhance your bowl your way with green  salsa sour cream mexican oregano chili  powder avocado tostadas chicharron onion
BBT_FLYF65k,561200,566399,or lime  how does this work you have to put  everything inside the posoli i like to
BBT_FLYF65k,566399,571440,begin with onion it also helps to  balance the plate oregano helps you
BBT_FLYF65k,571440,577200,prepare your tummy or all this dish but  if you put too much you may start to  cough
BBT_FLYF65k,577200,582880,i feel like i'm in some like medieval  pharmacy chili we better try it it's not  that spicy i'll be careful it's kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,582880,589360,spicy all right i will not taste it you  tasted it for us all the avocado you can  handle this is a lot of stuff we again
BBT_FLYF65k,589360,595920,meet with chicharron as you can see i  like it with a lot of lime then you have  to mix it it's gorgeous it's green
BBT_FLYF65k,595920,601519,there's like big chunks of avocado we  can see the pork skin let's go for it
BBT_FLYF65k,602320,608240,good yeah it's good like a very hearty  soup the taste is interesting let me see  if i can describe it it's not like a  traditional broth there's almost like a
BBT_FLYF65k,608240,613360,split pea soup how it's kind of almost a  gravy that's been made with the broth  and the starch together and the taste is
BBT_FLYF65k,613360,618640,kind of mild nothing super intense  cosola reminds me of the house of my  parents in the independence day do you
BBT_FLYF65k,618640,624880,know how this became associated with  that holiday no yeah if you asked me  like why do you eat turkeys on  thanksgiving i
BBT_FLYF65k,624880,631440,i wouldn't know there's so much in here  the avocado and the chicharron give it  different types of texture but they both  add a lot to it a bit of corn flavor
BBT_FLYF65k,631440,637839,coming through and then there's just big  beautiful stringy pieces of pork this is  like a big full robust meal
BBT_FLYF65k,637839,644320,what stands out most about this dish is  that this is not a simple dish it's a  lot of time and preparation that goes  into this i have seen that they sell
BBT_FLYF65k,644320,650320,cosole in the way they sell instant  soups i never tried it i don't want to  do it this is a ceremonial dish there is
BBT_FLYF65k,650320,656800,this legend that says the aztecs  invented  when they boil their enemies bodies in
BBT_FLYF65k,656800,662880,rocks and then eat it were they really  bad at farming are they just really  badass we only had chickens imagine that
BBT_FLYF65k,662880,668800,okay you only have chickens you should  as well just eat a guy when it comes to  creating authentic mexican cuisine
BBT_FLYF65k,668800,676160,there's one ingredient you simply can't  do without the chilies they're what  really make the food pop
BBT_FLYF65k,677040,683839,chili is just the surname of a family of  60 and they tend to carry a second name  depending on their state fresh or dried
BBT_FLYF65k,683839,690880,pickled or roasted chilis usually  accompany dishes in the form of salsas  moles powders or flakes but sometimes
BBT_FLYF65k,690880,696880,they're cast for the main role chef put  her there hola  hola how do you say chef in spanish chef
BBT_FLYF65k,696880,703360,ah i know a lot of spanish  we're standing in front of la poblanita  de tacubaya in half a decade of
BBT_FLYF65k,703360,709440,operation this restaurant has won  numerous international awards all thanks  to one dish that everyone in mexico
BBT_FLYF65k,709440,716800,knows what is the name of this food  chile  chile means chili like a big pepper  right exactly
BBT_FLYF65k,718000,723839,a sauce made of walnuts but i heard that  i that okay there's a carb on you guys
BBT_FLYF65k,723839,728959,okay let's go over here chili peppers  walnuts onions beef pomegranate raisin
BBT_FLYF65k,728959,737120,tomato pears the list of ingredients  goes on without following any apparent  theme all this makes up chile and nagada
BBT_FLYF65k,737120,743279,first chop the various vegetables and  fruits so is it more of a dessert or is  it more of a savory item something in
BBT_FLYF65k,743279,749360,between oh yeah sorry  all right this interview is going really  good so far
BBT_FLYF65k,749360,755279,beef stir-fried with fruit and nuts  a chili pepper grilled on the stove
BBT_FLYF65k,755279,761200,before having its skin and seeds removed  why is this dish so special to people  here well
BBT_FLYF65k,761200,766800,celebration there are so many legends  about the chile nuga but they say that  it's a dish that is connected to the
BBT_FLYF65k,766800,772240,independence of mexico because you will  find the colors of the mexican flag  after the beef is covered with the
BBT_FLYF65k,772240,779519,grilled chili pepper this whole lump of  random ingredients is blanketed with a  puree of white sweet creamy sauce made
BBT_FLYF65k,779519,785200,with walnuts garnish with parsley on one  side and pomegranate seeds on the other
BBT_FLYF65k,785200,791519,this looks awesome it's a little hard to  see visually but it's just so white so  all the details and contours get lost
BBT_FLYF65k,791519,797680,you don't realize that there's like  really a giant pepper underneath here  can we taste the sauce yes
BBT_FLYF65k,798800,804320,oh it's like a really yummy yogurt it is  so sweet and delicious it's got little  pieces of walnut and then there's
BBT_FLYF65k,804320,811279,pomegranate in here too it's a very very  complex dish because you have to peel  off the walnuts each walnut because the
BBT_FLYF65k,811279,816480,skin can make the sauce a bit bitter  it's hard for me to believe it's not oh
BBT_FLYF65k,816480,823519,but now i'm getting some taste of like  beef in there too oh this is so weird  because at first i would swear it's a  dessert
BBT_FLYF65k,823519,828720,split it right in half and then i'm  gonna just spread it open for the world  to see
BBT_FLYF65k,828720,834880,it is better than christmas morning  i like it it's so interesting it's like
BBT_FLYF65k,834880,840079,this ground meat is really well seasoned  a little bit savory a little bit sweet  and you're chewing on fruit this is like
BBT_FLYF65k,840079,846639,the weirdest fruit cobbler ever this is  a seasonal dish it used to be only  during september but the seasons of the
BBT_FLYF65k,846639,853199,fruits have changed because of level  warmth so you can find the pear and the  apple from july global warming not all
BBT_FLYF65k,853199,858240,bad right is that your point um  i love it today everything we've tried
BBT_FLYF65k,858240,863519,has been very traditional but some of  it's been a little bit more understated  it wasn't too wild this is exploding
BBT_FLYF65k,863519,868800,this is fireworks in my mouth and even  when you mix in grilled pepper right if  you described it to me i would say that
BBT_FLYF65k,868800,874800,sounds kind of gross and i'm eating it  now and i can't believe how much i love  it this is one of the most unique dishes  i've tried so far during this trip it is
BBT_FLYF65k,874800,880000,my first day i've only tried about four  foods but i don't know it's gonna be  really hard to top this that is very
BBT_FLYF65k,880000,883000,unique
BBT_FLYF65k,894639,899920,mexican street food is known for being  delicious and affordable for this whole  thing right here it's a dollar twenty
BBT_FLYF65k,899920,905680,five that's a good deal so today i'm  gonna put these price tags to the test  seeing if i can spend over one hundred
BBT_FLYF65k,905680,912880,dollars on one full day of eating  this might be impossible
BBT_FLYF65k,912880,919920,i'm headed to ho chi milco market a  teeming hive of activity with skilled  vendors and plenty of food
BBT_FLYF65k,919920,925920,oh it took my breath away here you'll  find a load of mexico's street food  staples under one roof the most fun part
BBT_FLYF65k,925920,931199,of this trip so far is just finding all  this mexican food that really isn't  available in the usa time to put my
BBT_FLYF65k,931199,941199,stomach and my wallet to the test  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,941199,947759,one of mexico's most traditional markets  dating all the way back to the 1950s  this place is loaded with vendors of all
BBT_FLYF65k,947759,954720,types now it has over 450 vendors inside  and out there's people with vegetables  produce cilantro in particular right
BBT_FLYF65k,954720,963120,here she has cilantro sorry you're on  the show now  our first food for today right here
BBT_FLYF65k,963120,969040,in the mornings people come here for her  steaming hot full-on carb breakfast
BBT_FLYF65k,972079,977440,a dish that combines this city's two  staples corn tortillas and salsa
BBT_FLYF65k,977440,984160,yes see we're interacting first  chiloquiles with salsa verde or green  salsa is scooped up from a hot steaming
BBT_FLYF65k,984160,990079,vessel then it's doused with cream this  is some pollo that means chicken what's  up eighth grade spanish onion yes see
BBT_FLYF65k,990079,995519,after the chicken she adds diced onions  and some cheese  here it's over a pound of food it's
BBT_FLYF65k,995519,1000800,making my wrist tired they can also put  all of this into a sandwich but i've  opted to not do that today i'm going to
BBT_FLYF65k,1000800,1006000,take a little bite from the corner here  oh it's still warm it's steaming hot  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,1006000,1012560,so immediately you taste the corn flavor  the salsa is soaked into the tortillas  so it's not dry but it's not quite a
BBT_FLYF65k,1012560,1019279,soup but something in between that's  just in the corner though on top of that  she's put layers of more stuff all that  i'm gonna get a nice bite here it looks
BBT_FLYF65k,1019279,1025760,like cottage cheese but it is not that  oh it's so good it has a similar  consistency to like a mashed potato
BBT_FLYF65k,1025760,1031199,that's still a little bit chunky  obviously you're not really going to  taste the chicken  the main flavor is coming from that
BBT_FLYF65k,1031199,1037038,salsa and from the sour cream the onions  offer a nice crisp oh my gosh this is  really irresistible i'm blown away that
BBT_FLYF65k,1037038,1042240,this is a dollar so i'm excited that  it's a dollar and i'm worried that it's  a dollar because if this is one dollar
BBT_FLYF65k,1042240,1047438,how am i gonna get to a hundred dollars  on  on to the next food time to head inside

BBT_FLYF65k,1071840,1077600,been providing patrons with traditional  local favorites this soup is made out of  cow's stomach called pancito
BBT_FLYF65k,1077600,1084240,pancito  the cow stomach is put into an already  made broth and stirred until its colors
BBT_FLYF65k,1084240,1090080,merge with the red chilies  after it cooks through the stomach is
BBT_FLYF65k,1090080,1096080,cut into small bite-sized pieces then  served with the chili broth  this is awesome because aside from the
BBT_FLYF65k,1096080,1102880,stomach they have what looks like a cow  hoof that's just been boiled forever  until it's become kind of soft and  gelatinous on the sides a variety of
BBT_FLYF65k,1102880,1110480,flavor enhancers limes onions red salsa  and even more chili right here dry  chilies it's in an old nest cafe bottle
BBT_FLYF65k,1110480,1116240,this reminds me of my friend his mother  would use the same containers to put  ghee inside that's good recycling save

BBT_FLYF65k,1141440,1146480,it's kind of gooey it's got some chew to  it mixed with some crunchy onions that  is outstanding it is time to work our
BBT_FLYF65k,1146480,1153440,way up to the stomach the cow's stomach  is one of the most bizarre looking  organs it's like kind of fuzzy and furry  it reminds me of a big shag carpet on
BBT_FLYF65k,1153440,1160000,the one side  why it's so fuzzy i feel like i'm eating  a rug it's so weird
BBT_FLYF65k,1160000,1166640,the first bite was really fuzzy and  furry and it freaked me out a little bit  second one was a lot more chewy which i  liked
BBT_FLYF65k,1166640,1172880,delicious outstanding that's food number  two we have a lot more to go our next  food was only this is a pre-hispanic
BBT_FLYF65k,1172880,1178240,delicacy made from a plant i've never  seen before this is a farm plant it  looks like something that would grow on
BBT_FLYF65k,1178240,1183919,the side of the highway it's high in  nutrition including calcium fiber and a  bunch of other vitamins i have two
BBT_FLYF65k,1183919,1188960,versions of it here this one's been  probably boiled a bit its applications  are versatile as the seeds can be used
BBT_FLYF65k,1188960,1194480,for harvesting while the flower buds can  be used for cooking that what you just  saw there is actually inside of here
BBT_FLYF65k,1194480,1200559,it's kind of a stringy food now the  preparation boiled us online are stuffed  with mexican cheese and encased in a
BBT_FLYF65k,1200559,1207039,whipped batter usually made from egg on  each of these stems you can like pull  off all of these things like this so
BBT_FLYF65k,1207039,1215990,that's what's supposed to happen in your  mouth when you eat that version the  battered result lay are deep fried  before being slathered in a tomato sauce
BBT_FLYF65k,1215990,1221600,[Music]

BBT_FLYF65k,1245120,1250799,i'd be eating the stick and everything  and i'd be like it's not that good but  when you peel everything off it's almost  like mashed peas and the flavors are
BBT_FLYF65k,1250799,1256480,just kind of gentle this is queso oaxaca  cheese from the region of oaxaca i  thought wisconsin cheese curds were good
BBT_FLYF65k,1256480,1262080,this gives wisconsin cheese curds a run  for their money  it's like a really good mozzarella that
BBT_FLYF65k,1262080,1268720,has way more texture to it they also  have tortillas on the side you can  actually strip off the food like you're  pulling meat off a kebab and put it in
BBT_FLYF65k,1268720,1274240,the taco look at the excellent workout  done  all right let's try it out  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,1274240,1280320,it's a tomato sauce but they're super  gentle not a ton of flavor and what a  unique preparation and it costs only  three dollars we are well on our way to
BBT_FLYF65k,1280320,1285600,100 let's keep this moving  ship i said ship
BBT_FLYF65k,1285600,1293120, our 100 challenge continues as i'm  heading deeper into the market to a  place called lahia de cabrera oh we have
BBT_FLYF65k,1293120,1300799,food number four right here i should  have asked questions about it what is  this this stop is almost as old as the  market itself first established in 1969
BBT_FLYF65k,1300799,1306080,miss norma cabrera is its owner so right  here we have the gordita ah the popular
BBT_FLYF65k,1306080,1312640,dishes quesadillas and gorditas  embarrassingly i've heard of the gordita  uh taco bell the crunchy gordita crunch
BBT_FLYF65k,1312640,1319760,is that a thing crispy gordita crunch  the crispy gordita crunch this it  actually looks a lot better the word  gordita literally translates into little
BBT_FLYF65k,1319760,1326080,fat one may i advise not calling your  wife this if you'd like to prolong your  life expectancy this starts with a thick
BBT_FLYF65k,1326080,1331919,corn dough that's stuffed with  chicharron i love that the fillings are  very unique something that you also  won't find at taco bell okay i swear to
BBT_FLYF65k,1331919,1336960,god i'm gonna stop comparing everything  to taco bell very soon after stuffing  the dough is flattened and grilled with
BBT_FLYF65k,1336960,1342559,pork lard a substitution for butter  when it's ready she cuts the now crispy
BBT_FLYF65k,1342559,1348960,dough in half  adds more lard and more fillings we have  iceberg lettuce we have cheese they call
BBT_FLYF65k,1348960,1355120,it basket cheese why i don't know you  guys can do your own research too i  think you're becoming too dependent on  me at this point lastly add a bit of
BBT_FLYF65k,1355120,1360320,pasta chili or mexican brown salsa  finally it's ready to serve oh this is
BBT_FLYF65k,1360320,1366159,how you know it's good it's already  dripping  it is such a thick satisfying crunch on
BBT_FLYF65k,1366159,1373120,the outside  on the inside the lettuce is giving it a  nice bit of texture  oh my god i'm in the very center now i'm
BBT_FLYF65k,1373120,1379600,getting a little bit more of that  chicharron it's a little heavy little  oily and just slightly gamey my gosh try  to look at this so it's just savory it's
BBT_FLYF65k,1379600,1385039,a little bit warm not spicy at all the  most fun part of this trip so far is  just finding all this mexican food that
BBT_FLYF65k,1385039,1391200,really isn't available there's like a  certain type of mexican food in the usa  and then it kind of is limited to that  for this whole thing right here it's a
BBT_FLYF65k,1391200,1398080,dollar 25. that's a good deal super  delicious we are four foods in i'm still  hungry let's do some more
BBT_FLYF65k,1399039,1404159,right here is our next menu item it  looks fantastic this is called i'm going  to try not to have a panic attack as i
BBT_FLYF65k,1404159,1409600,say this  see
BBT_FLYF65k,1409600,1415600,this mexican dish got its name from a  footwear the sandal to be exact and it  looks like the most delicious sandal
BBT_FLYF65k,1415600,1421120,i've ever seen this is not quick to make  and i'm finding that food here what you  make kind of depends on where you are
BBT_FLYF65k,1421120,1427279,and what time of day you're selling  first stuff black beans in the masa  dough and flatten  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,1427279,1432880,then give it its iconic oblong shape  before tossing it on the flat top here  these vendors are here all day they've
BBT_FLYF65k,1432880,1438559,got time the lady this morning no time  she would move so quickly she could  serve up by breakfast in like a minute
BBT_FLYF65k,1438559,1445200,but here this took about eight minutes  for this one dish right here now the  bill  chile green salsa red salsa top that
BBT_FLYF65k,1445200,1450559,with onions cheese lettuce and finally  grilled salted beef
BBT_FLYF65k,1450559,1456400,time to eat try just the beef  it's delightfully chewy super salty a
BBT_FLYF65k,1456400,1463520,little bit funky i don't know where  that's coming from i don't know how you  eat this because it's huge and they  don't exactly give you a fork i'm gonna  just lift it up like this
BBT_FLYF65k,1463520,1470159,oh first of all i think i bit into the  spicy end it's got a nice hit it warms  you up the bread here is so dense
BBT_FLYF65k,1470159,1476380,oh that's so good so as you eat your way  through supposedly the flavors should be  changing i'm going from red to green now
BBT_FLYF65k,1476380,1482960,[Music]  man i really go between loving red and  then loving green the red's a bit more  spicy green is super fresh and
BBT_FLYF65k,1482960,1488240,flamboyant i'm on the other end now it's  a little hard to distinguish between  what is bean and what is the darker
BBT_FLYF65k,1488240,1494159,salsa well let's try it out  the sauce there not as spicy it's fun  because the more you move around the
BBT_FLYF65k,1494159,1499520,more different flavors you get this is  the kind of meal that's just going to  sink to the bottom of your stomach like  the titanic and then it's gonna stay on
BBT_FLYF65k,1499520,1504720,the bottom of your stomach for as long  as the titanic did before james cameron  found it did he find it you guys ever
BBT_FLYF65k,1504720,1510240,wonder why rose didn't share the door  with jack they tried like once jack was  like oh let me try to get on and it
BBT_FLYF65k,1510240,1515760,wasn't convenient and rose was like can  you die instead and he's like yeah  you're super hot anyways this is five
BBT_FLYF65k,1515760,1521360,foods now it's starting to hit me but  i'm still determined let's keep going we  are on a roll already up to food number
BBT_FLYF65k,1521360,1527440,six now this i actually have seen before  it's called a pambazo
BBT_FLYF65k,1527679,1533250,calvin and i tried something like this  at the state fair of texas now i'm in  mexico city trying the original
BBT_FLYF65k,1533250,1540159,[Music]  hey epic reveal first they dip the bread  in a red guajillo pepper sauce and grill
BBT_FLYF65k,1540159,1546559,it with water when i ate it with calvin  they put so much chili sauce on it that  our hands were just caked and completely
BBT_FLYF65k,1546559,1552480,red here  huh  clean hands then the fillings potatoes
BBT_FLYF65k,1552480,1557679,mixed with chorizo then lettuce some  queso fresco and lastly the crema
BBT_FLYF65k,1557679,1564720,i'm gonna sit here like a little school  boy here we go  [Music]  oh super delicious they put sour cream
BBT_FLYF65k,1564720,1571840,on so many different foods here but it's  really different than the sour cream you  would get in the u.s it's very like  liquidy
BBT_FLYF65k,1572320,1578559,it's filled with a lot of stuff but what  you're really tasting is the seasoned  potato mixed with chorizo i couldn't  tell you if the bun actually had any
BBT_FLYF65k,1578559,1584640,flavor to it  [Music]  no the salsa they're putting on here i  don't think it's adding a lot of flavor
BBT_FLYF65k,1584640,1590960,but it's making it very nice it's very  pretty the price one dollar and 25 cents  that's outrageous i came out here today
BBT_FLYF65k,1590960,1596720,with the goal of eating a hundred  dollars worth of food i never give up  until it's really the end but
BBT_FLYF65k,1596720,1601919,spending a hundred dollars in mexico on  street food this might be impossible  that's impossible as this challenge
BBT_FLYF65k,1601919,1609120,seems right now i am pressing forward  determined to hit that one hundred  dollar mark wait hi so what is this
BBT_FLYF65k,1609279,1616080,black jack  jack  this dish right here is very exciting

BBT_FLYF65k,1628480,1634480,to say touch this is big it's flat and  most notably they've cut off all the  parts that can hurt you convenient the
BBT_FLYF65k,1634480,1639600,nepalese are usually julienne  here they're making it into a cactus
BBT_FLYF65k,1639600,1645279,salad ready to top our next food i'm  gonna pick up just one of these because  i'm so curious about it the inside feels
BBT_FLYF65k,1645279,1651360,kind of slimy like okra that's been  boiled  okay
BBT_FLYF65k,1651360,1658240,what is this  it's got some texture but it's a little  slimy too it's like a cross between okra
BBT_FLYF65k,1658240,1663919,and a green pepper that's been boiled  for a long time like so many other  street food treats in mexico city the
BBT_FLYF65k,1663919,1669840,taco starts with a corn dough but this  time it's stuffed with cheese
BBT_FLYF65k,1671140,1676190,[Music]  soon she adds the nopales salad and more  cheese
BBT_FLYF65k,1676190,1683799,[Music]  i'm gonna take a big bite here we go
BBT_FLYF65k,1684480,1690320,all the dishes in here have kind of a  similar dough base just really heavy  dense and oily this cheese is a little
BBT_FLYF65k,1690320,1695520,bit more sharp  these are some random toppings and  random ingredients i would not expect to
BBT_FLYF65k,1695520,1701200,see together topping that with cactus  that's wild  napale
BBT_FLYF65k,1701200,1706240,nepalese it's got to be painful  everybody who speaks spanish is turning  this off right now as well you should
BBT_FLYF65k,1706240,1712640,this one right here 1.25 super  affordable probably not a surprise  i have space in my four-chambered
BBT_FLYF65k,1712640,1719360,stomach for one final food this is my  last chance to get this challenge done  i'm hoping this last food costs around
BBT_FLYF65k,1719360,1725679,ninety dollars but you know what  i kind of doubt it will i'm heading back  to miss norma's stall to try out her
BBT_FLYF65k,1725679,1731039,other most popular dish guys i'm in the  kitchen with norma hola
BBT_FLYF65k,1732640,1738640,can we subtitle that please  it's a blue quesadilla something i've  never seen before so i'm ordering one of
BBT_FLYF65k,1738640,1744159,these it's like a skinny quesadilla it  starts with a blue corn dough rather  than the usual white so first she puts
BBT_FLYF65k,1744159,1749760,on the queso someone said oh when you go  to mexico they don't have cheese that's  just tex-mex incorrect mundo there's a
BBT_FLYF65k,1749760,1756159,lot of cheese here now for that special  ingredient corn smut smud doesn't sound  like that positive of a word wikipedia
BBT_FLYF65k,1756159,1762640,corn smud is a plant  it's a plant disease  we're eating a plant disease let me read
BBT_FLYF65k,1762640,1768399,more maybe this takes a turn somewhere  corn smud is a plant disease caused by  pathogenic fungus it's getting worse i
BBT_FLYF65k,1768399,1774240,think um the fungus forms gales on all  above ground parts of corn species it is
BBT_FLYF65k,1774240,1779600,edible  good turns out this plant disease is  considered a delicacy here in mexico and
BBT_FLYF65k,1779600,1786320,it's often used as a filling for  quesadillas so i've had a lot of  quesadillas in my life usually chicken  or beef and no one's ever offered me
BBT_FLYF65k,1786320,1792720,corn smudge so and she's going to close  that up and this is going to be one  unique quesadilla gracias

BBT_FLYF65k,4540719,4546320,sweet smelling at the same time do you  want to try some meat first first let's  go for it

BBT_FLYF65k,4606880,4612400,stingray or the barracuda barracuda all  right well i must eat a barracuda to
BBT_FLYF65k,4612400,4618320,become more like a buttercup i don't  know if it works that way for sure but  i'm gonna do it
BBT_FLYF65k,4618960,4625520,chef rehelia starts by scaling and  gutting the barracuda  he cleans it with water and scores the
BBT_FLYF65k,4625520,4631520,meat for maximal flavor penetration  now the seasoning open the ridges and
BBT_FLYF65k,4631520,4636800,add lemon pepper and herbs  all this will be cooked on a bed of
BBT_FLYF65k,4636800,4643840,onions and tomatoes but that's not even  close to all the preparation  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,4643840,4651280,he adds sweet potato slices then stuffs  the inside with carrots then bell pepper  choco a type of gourd zucchini broccoli

BBT_FLYF65k,4661920,4667280,manchego cheese  then wrap the whole thing in tin foil
BBT_FLYF65k,4667280,4674800,like some kind of futuristic fish mummy  grill for 15 to 20 minutes
BBT_FLYF65k,4674800,4680640,bring the barracuda wow  okay we might need a take-home bag brace
BBT_FLYF65k,4680640,4687040,yourself oh my gosh  look at that it's quite large all right
BBT_FLYF65k,4687040,4692800,he's cutting it open soon he will repeal  the fish oh yeah this guy knows how to  put on a shelf
BBT_FLYF65k,4692800,4699678,oh look at that there's so much on here  chef i mean come on you have outdone  yourself
BBT_FLYF65k,4700800,4708000,i'm overwhelmed this is incredible i  think we can stick our fork right into  it and just start taking bites let's  start with this this is but a plain
BBT_FLYF65k,4708000,4714159,mushroom but this mushroom should have  all the flavors and essence of  everything in here
BBT_FLYF65k,4714159,4719679,you were not wrong that's a good  mushroom yeah all those flavors are  really concentrated here i'm gonna pick
BBT_FLYF65k,4719679,4726640,up some of the broth here  [Music]  wow  it's amazing there's the fats from the
BBT_FLYF65k,4726640,4732080,fish mixed in with the chilies and the  vegetables making just this really deep  vegetable kind of meaty broth it's so
BBT_FLYF65k,4732080,4738400,good this is what i would call the neck  of the fish and it has cheese on it this  is a first from a fish skin with cheese
BBT_FLYF65k,4738400,4743679,on top let's try it out  it's something magical i've never  experienced this before me either i
BBT_FLYF65k,4743679,4748880,think i ate a whole bay leaf do you know  this yeah but i don't remember how to  call it but definitely you won't i just
BBT_FLYF65k,4748880,4754000,ate that whole thing  can i say very fresh and very fragrant  that's an interesting combination the
BBT_FLYF65k,4754000,4759840,cheese what do you think you like it or  you know yeah i do like it but  i think that it can be also good without
BBT_FLYF65k,4759840,4765679,the cheese yeah it doesn't need the  cheese  we've been avoiding it long enough i  think we need to build up to this right
BBT_FLYF65k,4765679,4772560,here this is the meat oh  wow look at that i mean it is super  white and it looks like very little fat
BBT_FLYF65k,4772560,4779360,let's try it out  [Music]  sticky steamed white fish but put this
BBT_FLYF65k,4779360,4785440,sauce back on i think this is the magic  trick right yeah cheers  oh wow my gosh it's all about this
BBT_FLYF65k,4785440,4790480,beautiful combination of flavors he's  created here the trick here is just mix  all these flavors together don't eat
BBT_FLYF65k,4790480,4795840,everything separately get the veggies  the sauce the soupy stuff and mix it all  up except for maybe the bay leaves don't
BBT_FLYF65k,4795840,4802480,eat that plate  before we end our seafood adventure i'm  told this market also has one creature
BBT_FLYF65k,4802480,4808560,that's been sparked sparking controversy  for the past decade we're in a shipping  container that was basically all frozen
BBT_FLYF65k,4808560,4814320,and inside it's full of sharks these are  thresher sharks right yes they are  sharks are very controversial these days
BBT_FLYF65k,4814320,4819360,because a lot of people think just  because it's a shark it's endangered and  some shark numbers are going down but
BBT_FLYF65k,4819360,4825120,some shark species can still be hunted  every time i eat shark i have to explain  like um no not all sharks are endangered
BBT_FLYF65k,4825120,4831199,and i'm not a bad person because i ate a  shark you are not thank you so much we  won't be eating these guys but not far

BBT_FLYF65k,4848480,4854719,that means ancient recipes and cooking  techniques that were passed on by this  land's original native people today i
BBT_FLYF65k,4854719,4860000,want to talk about one of the main meats  we're going to be eating i'm talking  about shark what is it that people like
BBT_FLYF65k,4860000,4867040,about shark beats  people just eat the meat but she says  that you can eat everything it's also
BBT_FLYF65k,4867040,4874520,used for medicine good for your skin i  need it because look at me can you guess  how old i am
BBT_FLYF65k,4878400,4884719,the first course starts with the gray  reef shark one of the most common reef  shark species in the indo-pacific remove
BBT_FLYF65k,4884719,4891280,the head split it in half and separate  the bones from the skin slicing it into  perfect fillets those get seasoned with
BBT_FLYF65k,4891280,4897440,salt and pepper dip it in the ricotta  roja salsa and let it hit the grill
BBT_FLYF65k,4898239,4904400,now the banana leaves lightly grilled to  make them more malleable allowing for  easier wrapping

BBT_FLYF65k,4910880,4916880,filet with more salsa add octopus shrimp  purple onions tomatoes habaneros avocado
BBT_FLYF65k,4916880,4921920,leaves mexican pepper leaves then  another shark fillet a final smothering

BBT_FLYF65k,4927600,4934080,consummate broth wrap the whole thing in  an ancient traditional tin foil and  place it over the fire until your
BBT_FLYF65k,4934080,4939440,ancestors tell you to take it off  oh here it is the moment we've been
BBT_FLYF65k,4939440,4946400,waiting for  all right so she takes the knife he's  cutting kind of a cross shape into it oh
BBT_FLYF65k,4946400,4953520,wow look at this it's like a seafood  lasagna  and it almost has like this really  fragrant tomatoey smell to it does your
BBT_FLYF65k,4953520,4959440,salsa have tomato yeah a bit of a food  expert thank you this is incredible like
BBT_FLYF65k,4959440,4965280,it's preparation  mishote yeah to me it looks like a
BBT_FLYF65k,4965280,4972320,seafood lasagna it's layers of seafood i  got a big piece here this is just  straight up shark meat let's try it out
BBT_FLYF65k,4972320,4977360,it's a very soft very tender meat it's  so juicy it does feel different from  other mexican foods i've had it's a lot
BBT_FLYF65k,4977360,4983520,of mexican foods that really pop and  this is a much more milder flavor so  mild i can just feel like the acid from  the tomato there's some salt there's
BBT_FLYF65k,4983520,4988560,pepper but there's nothing super intense  flavor-wise i think you're supposed to  kind of just appreciate the flavors of
BBT_FLYF65k,4988560,4995600,the meat itself if you move it around  there's little shrimpies  there's octopus
BBT_FLYF65k,4995600,5001120,i love it this way and everything has a  little bit different texture but just  similar fun flavors visually it's
BBT_FLYF65k,5001120,5007360,stunning there's so much effort and work  that goes into it for this beautiful  preparation and then when you get it at  your table they kind of unwrap it like
BBT_FLYF65k,5007360,5012719,this gift so so much of the food we're  trying here is about this awesome  experience that you'll have at the  restaurant that you could never have at

BBT_FLYF65k,5026639,5031920,our final meal shark stone soup the most  important element here not the shark the
BBT_FLYF65k,5031920,5036880,stones placed over red hot coals to heat  them up
BBT_FLYF65k,5039360,5045199,here they prep the bowl first and cook  it later let me show you start with  plantain leaves and chili paste then
BBT_FLYF65k,5045199,5051840,shark fillets are cut into thin slices  add shrimpies purple onions tomatoes  sliced jalapenos bay leaves and a
BBT_FLYF65k,5051840,5058960,sprinkle of episode or mexican tea  leaves add dried cilantro and rock sea  salt all this is just the preparation
BBT_FLYF65k,5058960,5064400,but the real cooking is about to start  right in front of us at the table
BBT_FLYF65k,5064880,5071760,dude he's carrying a lot of stuff these  are hot stones i feel like i'm by a  campfire these stones are so hot

BBT_FLYF65k,5077920,5085520,caroline i don't know what's gonna  happen  i'm afraid there's putting a stone in  it's a hot stone i can hear it simmering
BBT_FLYF65k,5085520,5090880,this is so cool it's like they brought a  completely uncooked soup to the table  and now they're putting rocks inside to
BBT_FLYF65k,5090880,5097040,heat it up it's boiling oh it's really  sputtering it's like a volcano i'm  enveloped in steam so you've never seen

BBT_FLYF65k,5102480,5108639,this looks awesome yes i think we should  start by trying the broth i'm going to  spoon just that yeah
BBT_FLYF65k,5108639,5114000,well very fresh it tastes almost  tomatoey yeah and a little bit of fish  oh yeah like a little bit of seafood
BBT_FLYF65k,5114000,5119760,flavor and a little bit of heat but not  too much very nice broth shall we start  with the shrimps okay so you take off
BBT_FLYF65k,5119760,5125760,the heads it's way hot it's a little hot  it's a little hot  i got a nice piece of shrimp here and

BBT_FLYF65k,5144080,5149520,out  wow  interesting so it doesn't have a very
BBT_FLYF65k,5149520,5154560,powerful flavor or anything like that  it's extremely soft in fact so it's  super soft and kind of watery but
BBT_FLYF65k,5154560,5159600,otherwise it's just kind of a white meat  there's nothing especially sharky about  it if you don't tell me that it's shark
BBT_FLYF65k,5159600,5165760,i wouldn't know it i expected something  like worse but no in fact it's pretty  great
BBT_FLYF65k,5165760,5171120,so this is awesome super creative i love  that it's a meal but it's also an  experience right yeah i love the way
BBT_FLYF65k,5171120,5177280,it's cooked in front of our eyes  absolutely it's tasty but even more than  that it's instagramable yeah and that's

BBT_FLYF65k,5327600,5334320,doing that i'm gonna call american bugs  americans  in ancient mexico insects were an  inseparable part of the diet these are
BBT_FLYF65k,5334320,5340880,the chapulines which is grasshoppers  okay maggie worm and also chicatana ants  these days it's not essential but it's
BBT_FLYF65k,5340880,5348840,still not uncommon to find bugs working  their way into some of the local cuisine  like these ant egg tacos which are quite
BBT_FLYF65k,5348840,5355760,delicious for the brave you can also eat  them plain like with most of the food  here slap on some lime some chili powder
BBT_FLYF65k,5355760,5363520,and it's ready to go  this is like a wood worm oh no just the
BBT_FLYF65k,5363520,5369520,bug so this is some kind of a larvae and  something that is going to blow your  mind is that this stuff is chili mixed
BBT_FLYF65k,5369520,5377880,with a bug that is made powder we're  seasoning bugs with other bubbles  exactly here we go one cheers
BBT_FLYF65k,5379280,5386000,hmm the citrus makes it real fresh huh  the lime and the chili powder makes it  better yeah yeah it tastes good you're
BBT_FLYF65k,5386000,5391600,very optimistic and positive it's a  little earthy but super dry it tastes  like dry meat kind of oh yeah a little
BBT_FLYF65k,5391600,5397520,bit like a jerky like if you had an  uncle who had no idea how to make turkey  but he's trying his best if i was in  asia that would give me some kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,5397520,5402880,superpower yeah i mean you can hear it  but it is basically it's just a snack  usually you can just grab it on the way
BBT_FLYF65k,5402880,5409840,home on the way home  you're just making all these weird  scenarios you're on your way to a job  interview
BBT_FLYF65k,5409920,5415040,so this is bugs what i've been told is  if you want some kind of mystery exotic  meat set you're definitely not going to
BBT_FLYF65k,5415040,5421000,find in the usa this is the market to  come to is that right exactly
BBT_FLYF65k,5423360,5428800,100 years ago this market was much like  any other  the more exotic foods crept in from the
BBT_FLYF65k,5428800,5435920,1970s luring in curious eaters and  adventurous chefs who wanted to taste  the prehispanic diet as well as rare
BBT_FLYF65k,5435920,5443360,meats like rabbit quail venison ostrich  and buffalo we're a place where we can  fight exotic meat exotic like that like
BBT_FLYF65k,5443360,5449679,this exactly as the market expanded so  did the list of available proteins from  all around the world like this llama
BBT_FLYF65k,5449679,5455199,meat being served up by fernando in his  kitchen i don't think i've ever had  llama they look cute yeah they look like
BBT_FLYF65k,5455199,5461679,alpacas which are also exactly yeah but  do they taste cute  also known as the new world camel llamas
BBT_FLYF65k,5461679,5467760,were domesticated in the early 1500s  their coats are used to make cloth and  their meat
BBT_FLYF65k,5467760,5473760,well here it's marinated with  chimichurri sauce made of parsley  cilantro oregano garlic and olive oil
BBT_FLYF65k,5473760,5479840,then seared atop a hot plate this has  just been cooked up here right now it's  so hot i tried alpaca when i was in peru
BBT_FLYF65k,5479840,5485380,and it tastes weird for me it tastes  like grass but i don't know it's the  same for llama let's try it out
BBT_FLYF65k,5485380,5491679,[Music]  i'm eating a llama it tastes like a
BBT_FLYF65k,5491679,5499040,steak like a normal steak  it tastes good it tastes like beef that  is not beefy it's the opposite of alpaca
BBT_FLYF65k,5499040,5504960,because alpaca for me it's stringy like  very grassy yeah super clean there's no  intense spices on here it's just kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,5504960,5512000,some salt and some oil i'm pretty  impressed this is like my new post  workout meal screw chicken breasts i'm  gonna start doing llama that's wild so

BBT_FLYF65k,5531520,5537239,they used to have the whole crocodile  but they cook it and they let the head  how much would you charge for this hut  it's
BBT_FLYF65k,5537239,5543440,2500 pesos this is quite the souvenir i  don't know if u.s customs is going to  let me back in with this in my suitcase
BBT_FLYF65k,5543440,5549920,but that is wild so i know for sure they  have llama and crocodile what else  bernado wild boar ostrich i could see
BBT_FLYF65k,5549920,5557600,lion as well  did you say lion lion meat you want to  see it yeah okay
BBT_FLYF65k,5558560,5563600,the lion king of the jungle the ultimate  apex predator
BBT_FLYF65k,5563600,5569600,iconic  powerful and if you pay the right price  it's yours what is us here in the form
BBT_FLYF65k,5569600,5575199,of a steak  so there's an opportunity to eat  something this rare someone somewhere is
BBT_FLYF65k,5575199,5580239,going to try it  oh it's a leg this is the leg of a lion
BBT_FLYF65k,5580239,5586880,right here this is just pure muscle is  this your most expensive meme  yeah the lion is the most expensive one
BBT_FLYF65k,5586880,5591920,7 500 or 8 kilos what's it taste like i  don't know i haven't never eats lion
BBT_FLYF65k,5591920,5596960,meat  he told me that it's a super intense  flavor and it has a lot of toxins on the
BBT_FLYF65k,5596960,5602880,meat so it's recommended to not to eat  more than one kilo per person once a  week up to two pounds per week that's a
BBT_FLYF65k,5602880,5610960,lot but what about regulations around  exotic meat how is this possibly legal  lion is legal to eat here see he told me
BBT_FLYF65k,5610960,5616960,that it comes from a farm so it's  totally legal sales of lion meat are  legal if they're sourced from a licensed
BBT_FLYF65k,5616960,5622560,farm whereas unlicensed slaughtering can  result in a felony how do i know this is  really lying
BBT_FLYF65k,5622560,5628639,supposedly each stake carries with it a  meticulous paper trail authenticating  the legality and legitimacy of the
BBT_FLYF65k,5628639,5634480,meaning basically he told me that he has  to trust on the farm a trust yeah but  when it comes to the question of who
BBT_FLYF65k,5634480,5641040,owns these lion farms and where they can  be found well this information is not  readily available people watching this
BBT_FLYF65k,5641040,5648000,video right now some of them are  interested some of them are freaking out  i don't even know how i feel for sure is  this something you would try well it's
BBT_FLYF65k,5648000,5655280,kind of difficult because i don't know  you don't have to try it because you're  on my show i would like to watch it and  then maybe think about it but like right
BBT_FLYF65k,5655280,5661440,now maybe not i think for now we pass  it's very interesting yeah but wow lion
BBT_FLYF65k,5661440,5667520,it turns out there's another option  fernando actually sources much of his  product from a private ranch just
BBT_FLYF65k,5667520,5673239,outside mexico city and he's agreed to  bring us there
BBT_FLYF65k,5675140,5681840,[Music]  two-hour drive southeast of mexico city
BBT_FLYF65k,5681840,5687040,will bring you here a 247-acre ranch  called el moral
BBT_FLYF65k,5687040,5692159,here they specialize in sheep  deer and a formidable beast i've come
BBT_FLYF65k,5692159,5701360,here to see in the flesh  [Music]  swift feet sharp teeth and a bulky body
BBT_FLYF65k,5701360,5706880,a wall of muscle and bone this is a wild  boar  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,5706880,5711920,and they're really easy to piss off  hello we are in the pen with that i'm
BBT_FLYF65k,5711920,5717760,kind of nervous actually he's telling me  that their cats smell the beer
BBT_FLYF65k,5719280,5725840,wild boars generally resemble domestic  pigs no but with a longer snout and legs  oh my god you had the whole control of
BBT_FLYF65k,5725840,5731679,the animal thank you  they can reach up to 500 pounds have you
BBT_FLYF65k,5731679,5737600,ever seen one of these wild boars attack  or bite a human gee  i was hoping you would just say no  they're actually super friendly once you
BBT_FLYF65k,5737600,5742719,get to know them and not really he's  like it could be a real issue  the wild boar is native to much of
BBT_FLYF65k,5742719,5749360,eurasia and north africa but they were  introduced to north america in the 19th  century as demand for wild boar has
BBT_FLYF65k,5749360,5755520,increased so has the number of people  farming it  in between 6 to 12 months a board like
BBT_FLYF65k,5755520,5768159,this is ready for slaughter  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,5768159,5773920,is this more expensive than just usual  pork or pig he told me that because of  the diet the wild birds they eat a lot
BBT_FLYF65k,5773920,5780920,of oatmeal wheat and cereal it costs two  or three times more than the normal  thing
BBT_FLYF65k,5783330,5794239,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,5794719,5801040,why do people like wild boar so much  does it taste a lot different from pork  ah let's get the difference basically  the whole difference between a pig and a
BBT_FLYF65k,5801040,5806480,wellbore is the fat the fat in here with  the meat and with the muscle it tastes  cleaner
BBT_FLYF65k,5806480,5812560,unlike most pigs here they skin the  hairy beast  trim the fat
BBT_FLYF65k,5812560,5819440,and let it hang for 24 hours  from here it typically gets sectioned up  and sent to the market
BBT_FLYF65k,5819440,5826960,but not today  today i'll experience wild boar roasted  whole cooked up the
BBT_FLYF65k,5835199,5841360,pepe is a self-taught chef and he's been  refining his board recipe for the last  five years
BBT_FLYF65k,5841360,5846400,first he seasons the bourbon salt  and marinates it with a sauce of oregano
BBT_FLYF65k,5846400,5849960,salt and herbs
BBT_FLYF65k,5855040,5861360,i smell the oregano already yeah it  smells good now the preparation method  is something that i believe is going to  be new for me i see there's a pit over
BBT_FLYF65k,5861360,5867280,here there's some kind of rotisserie but  he still has to set it up  so he's grabbing this torture device
BBT_FLYF65k,5867280,5873280,it's got these crossbars where the arms  will be attached he takes some wire  pokes it all the way through the meat
BBT_FLYF65k,5873280,5878320,and he loops it around the steel here  i've never seen something like this
BBT_FLYF65k,5878320,5883360,hey i'm curious i've seen a lot of pigs  bores creatures that look like this  being roasted before i've never seen one
BBT_FLYF65k,5883360,5888480,with all the hair still on its head why  is it still like this
BBT_FLYF65k,5888480,5893840,he told me that it looks cooler and to  make sure that we are eating more and  not a pig it's absolutely different from
BBT_FLYF65k,5893840,5899280,roasting a pig because as you know  people here love skin no one skins a pig  before roasting it yeah here they've
BBT_FLYF65k,5899280,5905280,actually have taken all of the skin off  along with the fur what do they do with  that skin
BBT_FLYF65k,5905280,5911679,basically he told me that the pore is  pretty hard you can put it like on the  wall you can also use it to make some  brushes like a toothbrush yeah like a
BBT_FLYF65k,5911679,5915360,toothbrush would you use it as a  toothbrush
BBT_FLYF65k,5918000,5924000,roasting a bore this is not a set it and  forget it type situation it must be  rotated every few minutes for two to
BBT_FLYF65k,5924000,5928560,three hours until the meat cooks all the  way through
BBT_FLYF65k,5929460,5932739,[Music]

BBT_FLYF65k,5976800,5981840,good views  grasshoppers i want to talk about what's  in front of us right now i've had
BBT_FLYF65k,5981840,5987920,grasshoppers a lot in the past and  usually they're just like fried and  eaten whole here you've made it into  kind of a soup this recipe where does
BBT_FLYF65k,5987920,5993119,this come from  it is  actually it was a plant there was a lot
BBT_FLYF65k,5993119,5998400,of grasshoppers so they came up with the  idea to make this soup and also fry them

BBT_FLYF65k,6044880,6050800,broth itself it's like a grasshopper  milk this could be the next big thing  japolines
BBT_FLYF65k,6052000,6057199,it's one of the most unique textures  i've seen from something that just comes  from an insect because if you didn't  tell people that this was made from
BBT_FLYF65k,6057199,6063280,grasshopper they would probably think  it's some kind of like a beef frog  yeah like a meat juice that's really
BBT_FLYF65k,6063280,6068960,stunning we started yesterday with some  exotic meats and i was trying to find  out what kind of really interesting or

BBT_FLYF65k,6092320,6099360,with what they do every day so it's  important to say that they're doing this  because they want to preserve the  species make sustainability and profit
BBT_FLYF65k,6099360,6106320,as well  [Music]  two hours later and the boar is nearly  finished pepe scores the meat more to

BBT_FLYF65k,6165840,6170880,this weird texture as you rip through it  like you're eating a bunch of sea grapes  that pop in your mouth like eating fish
BBT_FLYF65k,6170880,6176000,roe almost but not slimy like that it's  got like a weird sponge too can't  understand but yeah do you say can't
BBT_FLYF65k,6176000,6181760,understand but yeah i kind of you  understand  from here you're just gonna cut up the  whole thing and throw it on a platter
BBT_FLYF65k,6181760,6194880,and let's sit down and eat  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,6194880,6202159,gentlemen this looks incredible  incredible i love it when the words like  are so close in spanish in english
BBT_FLYF65k,6202159,6207760,let's do a quick tour of the table right  now we have the tortillas guacamole  salad and onion and the whole leg here
BBT_FLYF65k,6207760,6213920,yeah i'm curious how to eat this i think  you could just eat the meat alone for me  it's better with tortilla we got oh
BBT_FLYF65k,6213920,6220000,i haven't tried this yet i have pretty  strong alcohol mezcal it's like  tequila's uncle with the dark past he
BBT_FLYF65k,6220000,6226480,doesn't like to talk about it  it's also made from agave  i used to have asthma when i was 12 and
BBT_FLYF65k,6226480,6230480,i think that would have cured it yeah  i'm feeling ready to eat
BBT_FLYF65k,6231520,6238400,oh he has a surprise for us or another  battle i think  i thought the wild boar was enough but
BBT_FLYF65k,6238400,6245040,maybe fernando felt left out while we  were setting up for dinner he grilled up  his own culinary contribution utilizing
BBT_FLYF65k,6245040,6250000,his very specific exotic meat expertise
BBT_FLYF65k,6251119,6256400,fernando he's on the hunt for something  what's that oh it's another kind of meat  it's
BBT_FLYF65k,6256400,6264090,he says that we need to guess  is grande  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,6266639,6275840,oh no  so this is lion it's lion i don't know  if i'm ready for this you want to smell  it yeah can i take a look at it
BBT_FLYF65k,6277600,6282800,it's hard to say if it looks like lion  or it just looks like protein  it looks like steak it looks kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,6282800,6289360,beefy and dark and kind of sinewy  philosophically i don't know if i really  have any issue trying lion oh i don't
BBT_FLYF65k,6289360,6295600,know yeah this is a tough one well it's  certainly unusual um but it's not  endangered he's not in it it's legal
BBT_FLYF65k,6295600,6301440,yeah and it's here  on the table it's on the table i don't  want to be rude he's prepared it uh i
BBT_FLYF65k,6301440,6305760,guess  yes okay let's do it
BBT_FLYF65k,6310800,6316800,what can you imagine of the flavor of  this meat i bet it's probably very lean  and from the feel of my fork right now
BBT_FLYF65k,6316800,6321920,i'm going to say a little bit chewy okay  he's already chomping on it uro dost
BBT_FLYF65k,6321920,6331119,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,6332000,6337280,so chewy very chewy very chewy  well there's some fat in there yeah and
BBT_FLYF65k,6337280,6343440,the tart bits  he grilled this and the charred  tastes real nice now it's not dry
BBT_FLYF65k,6343440,6350159,but it is chewy yeah is this eaten  because it tastes amazing or because  it's a lion
BBT_FLYF65k,6350159,6356080,the first time it's just with curiosity  they're like right into the meat but  after that if they like it they go
BBT_FLYF65k,6356080,6361119,buying this meat like concept they're  asked for a hamburger just for the sake  i can say the flavor is good you put
BBT_FLYF65k,6361119,6366239,just a little bit of salt on it it just  tastes a little bit beefy and oily  although not overly fatty because
BBT_FLYF65k,6366239,6372000,usually more fat will meet a little bit  more tenderness it's on the verge of  being uneatable because it's so tough so
BBT_FLYF65k,6372000,6378239,it's really unique in that way what do  you think  it was his first time trying the lion he  loved to start to chewing and chewing
BBT_FLYF65k,6378239,6384080,and chewing your first time  maybe you'll put a lions on your ranch  next
BBT_FLYF65k,6384880,6390480,quite a unique experience i don't want  the lion to overshadow this this is what  we really came here for
BBT_FLYF65k,6390480,6395760,i love that we have like a whole leg  here we can just carve it ourselves all  right we got some mean i'm gonna put a
BBT_FLYF65k,6395760,6402800,load of onions and some guacamole my  first wild boar taco so many firsts on  this trip cheers
BBT_FLYF65k,6404159,6409920,it's amazing it's so delicious it's  interesting you know doing this kind of  video or having this kind of experience  that people are going to see it's
BBT_FLYF65k,6409920,6415119,impossible to do this without somebody  having strong opinions about it yeah and
BBT_FLYF65k,6415119,6420960,it's just people you know in our  day-to-day lives we've become really  conditioned like these certain types of  things are normal it's what i'm used to
BBT_FLYF65k,6420960,6427840,so that's what's okay yeah and food is  like a religion to almost everybody  around the world whether they know it or  not like what they're familiar with is
BBT_FLYF65k,6427840,6434080,what is canon to them yeah that is what  is okay yeah anything outside of that  should be questioned so there's no way
BBT_FLYF65k,6434080,6439199,to make a video like this and satisfy  everybody someone's gonna be upset about  it for me my goal is just to show i
BBT_FLYF65k,6439199,6445440,guess the diversity that exists in the  world and that there's no set normal  and it's also a good opportunity for
BBT_FLYF65k,6445440,6450560,people to take a look at their own  beliefs because people always blame the  vegans but it's not the vegans the
BBT_FLYF65k,6450560,6456000,people that complain the most about  videos with animal meat included it's  the people who eat meat but won't accept
BBT_FLYF65k,6456000,6461119,other types of meat being eaten so maybe  they eat beef and they're like well  that's okay yeah but this one's not okay
BBT_FLYF65k,6461119,6466400,and so i think it's good for people to  have a moment to like look at their own  beliefs and question them a little bit
BBT_FLYF65k,6466400,6471840,because that's something i've done over  and over while doing this show so guys  just want to say one more time gentlemen
BBT_FLYF65k,6471840,6478639,amigos thank you very much for this  experience incredible and something i'll  remember for a very long time

BBT_FLYF65k,6497199,6502880,but today i'll be meeting a few people  who are up to this challenge do you know  how many tamales you're making in a day
BBT_FLYF65k,6502880,6509280,three thousand tamales it's just in  eight hours wow they have double shifts  well you have to make the counts oh
BBT_FLYF65k,6509280,6515360,today i'm on a mission to discover some  of mexico's mega food factories i've  never seen any tamales that look like
BBT_FLYF65k,6515360,6522639,this what is going on here facilities  manufacturers and street side cookeries  kicking out massive amounts of food from
BBT_FLYF65k,6522639,6529280,local staples i'm gonna show you how you  can know if you are eating a real  tortilla
BBT_FLYF65k,6529280,6537119,to the most soft succulent meat you've  ever laid eyes on is that a nose rumba  drama a freaking nose and it all starts
BBT_FLYF65k,6537119,6542159,right here you know how many they have  here they have 16 different kinds of  tamales 16 different tasters there's so
BBT_FLYF65k,6542159,6548800,many our first location is right here  tamale  this company has its own factory that
BBT_FLYF65k,6548800,6554719,produces over a dozen varieties of  tamale but we'll get more into that  later it's like fast food for mexico

BBT_FLYF65k,6566560,6572159,what would you call this i've become  very familiar with faraday so far in  this trip first stop chicken tamale with
BBT_FLYF65k,6572159,6579360,green salsa you have to unwrap it oh  with your hands you don't need the fork  okay it's bitter sure  a corn husk is wrapped around corn dough
BBT_FLYF65k,6579360,6586639,which is wrapped around the fillings no  you do need the fork it's too juicy  in this case salsa and chicken but the
BBT_FLYF65k,6586639,6592719,fillings can be anything you can imagine  what do you think the flavors are pretty  mild nothing too intense it has like a
BBT_FLYF65k,6592719,6599199,fluffy corn taste to it and it's a  little dry  that's the point it's supposed to be dry  yeah sure you love dry things yeah i
BBT_FLYF65k,6599199,6604880,love dry things we don't have that in  common this is the classic it's got  chicken a little bit of protein tons of
BBT_FLYF65k,6604880,6610320,corn a little salsa verde to spice it up  here's my understanding though with  tamales i thought you always put stuff
BBT_FLYF65k,6610320,6616560,inside not all the time the majority of  the times  [Applause]  oscar i would shake your hand but that

BBT_FLYF65k,6637040,6643280,three thousand tamales just in eight  hours what do they have double chests  well you have to make the counts oh no
BBT_FLYF65k,6643280,6648719,okay i can do this  five million i've seen tamales before
BBT_FLYF65k,6648719,6653760,but i've never seen any tamales that  look like this what is going on here  it's a sugar tamale so this is going to
BBT_FLYF65k,6653760,6660639,be sweet yeah  the process starts with the dough in a  mixer he adds butter brown sugar baking
BBT_FLYF65k,6660639,6665920,powder food coloring and lard a  semi-solid white fat product obtained by
BBT_FLYF65k,6665920,6671119,rendering the fatty tissue of a pig then  corn flour and water and then why is it
BBT_FLYF65k,6671119,6677520,pink it's just the representative color  of here mexico does it taste a little  pink no now that they have all their
BBT_FLYF65k,6677520,6683440,ingredients it's time to assemble  the dough and raisins are set on a corn
BBT_FLYF65k,6683440,6689760,husk bed unlike the other tamales this  one doesn't have fillings inside after  this they are going to steam it and then
BBT_FLYF65k,6689760,6695199,we get to finally try it now it's not  morning time how do you feel about  having the tamale for dinner um i don't

BBT_FLYF65k,6749760,6755679,atom without jerry yeah tom without  yeary jerry oh jerry  i'm just teasing you coming up we're
BBT_FLYF65k,6755679,6762800,headed to a street food stall that's  prepping mind-blowing massive amounts of  meat in these giant cauldrons but first
BBT_FLYF65k,6762800,6768320,that meat needs a place to go the  tortilla good morning hi how are you  good morning good morning santiago and
BBT_FLYF65k,6768320,6775119,daniela co-founded this factory five  years ago producing and distributing a  thousand pounds of corn dough or masa
BBT_FLYF65k,6775119,6780320,every day half of which is made into  tortillas what do you think that it's a  special thing about this place i mean
BBT_FLYF65k,6780320,6787840,your plate we make the next amal this  process is an ancient process that has  with us almost 5 000 a year and we are
BBT_FLYF65k,6787840,6794000,losing it  let's jump into the process from  beginning to end can you tell me every  step i know it starts with water and
BBT_FLYF65k,6794000,6800880,then what just start  okay yeah so we only need three  ingredients water limestone and corn
BBT_FLYF65k,6800880,6807280,limestone we call it calvibas it's the  most pure form of limestone so i have a  lot of questions about the limestone
BBT_FLYF65k,6807280,6813520,when the water mixes with limestone it  creates a chemical reaction softening  the stone and heating the water what is
BBT_FLYF65k,6813520,6818560,the purpose of mixing that with the corn  what does that do this process is called  nixtamalization it's modifying the
BBT_FLYF65k,6818560,6823679,protein chains in the corn make it  digestible for us the second one is have  you ever grabbed a taco and it has
BBT_FLYF65k,6823679,6828960,broken up yeah yeah yeah i hate that  that happens when you don't have an  examinalized tortilla that's why they
BBT_FLYF65k,6828960,6835119,use two tortillas  oh is that wine one of the reasons yeah  i'm sure after boiling the corn will be
BBT_FLYF65k,6835119,6841600,put to rest for 12 hours and then the  next morning we come and we put in the  grinder and then we have the masa
BBT_FLYF65k,6841600,6846960,[Music]  the nyx demolized corn is ground inside
BBT_FLYF65k,6846960,6852080,a giant grinding machine what's the  favorite one the favorite one is the  blue one the result is this bluish green
BBT_FLYF65k,6852080,6857440,color where i come from we use about one  type of corn here though corn is such a  huge part of the diet in mexico
BBT_FLYF65k,6857440,6863599,therefore there's so many different  types of corn being used just in mexico  we have 60 different types of corn 60
BBT_FLYF65k,6863599,6870239,60. how does that change the tortilla is  it changing the flavor is it texture  blues and reds have more antioxidants
BBT_FLYF65k,6870239,6876400,than the yellow one the yellow one since  the color is paler so it can absorb more  sun and it tends to create more sugar
BBT_FLYF65k,6876400,6882320,naturally after grinding they move the  dough to a multi-purpose tortilla making  monster
BBT_FLYF65k,6882320,6888000,it kneads the dough as it's fed into the  machine then it stamps out tortillas and  sends them to the oven we don't only
BBT_FLYF65k,6888000,6894800,make tortillas we can also make gorditas  tamales  everyone in mexico knows to cook a
BBT_FLYF65k,6894800,6901679,tortilla requires not two but three  flips it would go from the first rack to  the second to the third and it will make
BBT_FLYF65k,6901679,6907920,the three cooking stages that thirty  years and it pops it pops it means well  done well done it's even said that if
BBT_FLYF65k,6907920,6913760,your tortilla puffs you can get married  now  after baking it pops out ready to pop in
BBT_FLYF65k,6913760,6919520,to the nearest mouth this is what i'm  most excited for these are super fresh  they just popped out of the machine and
BBT_FLYF65k,6919520,6924880,they are blue and they're blue look how  gorgeous these are please thank you  here's a little bit of salt okay yeah
BBT_FLYF65k,6924880,6930320,this is a salt top  is this like what you would eat in  college no we have this okay then a
BBT_FLYF65k,6930320,6935599,little bit salsa cheers  mmm that's all good yeah i know this is
BBT_FLYF65k,6935599,6941199,good right well i know this is like the  foundation but it's a delicious  foundation obviously on here you're  stacking meat you're sucking even more
BBT_FLYF65k,6941199,6947360,flavors but it's surprisingly soft it's  so soft and i've always loved flour  tortillas hold on let me chew a little  bit more oh
BBT_FLYF65k,6947360,6952639,a lot of the corn tortillas i've had  have just been more like crumbly falling  apart and sometimes dry in your mouth
BBT_FLYF65k,6952639,6958880,too much limestone too much yeah this is  fantastic can i have one more yeah go  ahead
BBT_FLYF65k,6958880,6965040,it took three years to understand it yes  completely it's astounding listening to  you too i feel like i'm in a master

BBT_FLYF65k,7000930,7008080,[Music]  welcome to the wild world of carnitas
BBT_FLYF65k,7008080,7014560,this is my man ruben the owner he's in  charge here here at carubes carnitas  i've come to see how they make carnitas
BBT_FLYF65k,7014560,7021599,from the beginning right here pig just  in this one container it's about 250  kilograms it's over 500 pounds and he's
BBT_FLYF65k,7021599,7028159,doing over a thousand pounds each day  this is one of the most iconic foods in  all of mexico and it all starts by
BBT_FLYF65k,7028159,7034880,simmering a combination of pig parts for  hours until the meat breaks down and  becomes soft and tender so which pig
BBT_FLYF65k,7034880,7041520,parts do they use well oh is that a nose  all of them  drama a freaking nose
BBT_FLYF65k,7041520,7046639,out of the ear right here basically  every part of the pig is in here i know  what you're thinking wow they're boiling
BBT_FLYF65k,7046639,7051760,all these pig parts in all this dark  water no  this is large animal fat that it's kind
BBT_FLYF65k,7051760,7058239,of bubbling in for hours until it gets  super super soft animal lard is  ubiquitous in this city's cuisine from
BBT_FLYF65k,7058239,7064239,the tamales we tried earlier to carnitas  and even chicharron now different people  order different parts some people might
BBT_FLYF65k,7064239,7070480,want ear some people might want legs  some people want more fatty meat some  people want more dry meat either way you  can order it they're going to take it
BBT_FLYF65k,7070480,7075840,from here to the assembly area that's  where it gets chopped into little meat
BBT_FLYF65k,7075840,7081840,carnitas literally means little meats  because after the braising process it'll  be chopped into tiny pieces before
BBT_FLYF65k,7081840,7088480,making its way to a tortilla oh what is  this intestines  he's mixing all that in chop chop chop
BBT_FLYF65k,7088480,7094639,that's going to hit the flat top boom  sizzle  he's got the tortilla shells right here
BBT_FLYF65k,7094639,7100719,they're on the flat top too he flips in  some meat  have some salsa on it and that's going
BBT_FLYF65k,7100719,7106159,to be an awesome lunch but there's one  restaurant who serves this food a little  differently
BBT_FLYF65k,7106159,7112800,they skip the tortilla all together in  favor of a gordita let me show you what  i mean hey nice to meet you nice to meet
BBT_FLYF65k,7112800,7121040,you how many years do you have here with  the business  1960 or from 1960 until now
BBT_FLYF65k,7121040,7127599,it has to be before your dad right maybe  your grandpa  oh his dad just was a worker here and
BBT_FLYF65k,7127599,7132960,then he owns the business oh that's cool  looking at the menu behind you is loaded  with food so are you serving just
BBT_FLYF65k,7132960,7139679,carnitas or a lot of other stuff too  there's other kind of food but the  specialty here in the house is gorditas
BBT_FLYF65k,7139679,7145840,the gordita take corn dough and smash it  into a disk then fry it in oil
BBT_FLYF65k,7145840,7152320,and when it's cooked through cut it in  half and stuff it with deliciousness in  this case carnitas also made in a giant
BBT_FLYF65k,7152320,7159440,stainless steel vessel first of all how  big is that pot that you cook in each  morning at 5 00 pm 400 liters 400 liters
BBT_FLYF65k,7159440,7165520,like could you fit your whole body in  there  for four bodies like each day
BBT_FLYF65k,7165520,7171679,each day you think he's cooking bodies  every day like human bodies so that's  really big guys i don't know if you have  other better measurements let me know
BBT_FLYF65k,7171679,7177599,like how many watermelons could you put  in there  you can fill it with 500 melons 500
BBT_FLYF65k,7177599,7184880,melons wow and how many people do you  receive here daily no no hold on sorry  how many pineapples no no you're right
BBT_FLYF65k,7184880,7190880,today we're going to try three different  carnita fillings with the gordita  after frying the gordita is stuffed with
BBT_FLYF65k,7190880,7197760,carnita fillings of your choosing the  meat is then topped with onions herbs  salsa and some lime on the side
BBT_FLYF65k,7197760,7202800,we have all of our gorditas here how do  you say like carnitas gorditas gorditas
BBT_FLYF65k,7202800,7209119,carnitas what is day that it's what i  thought khan is wait you can also say  that it's like off our final meal the
BBT_FLYF65k,7209119,7214239,combo platter carnitas from the pig  snout the ribs and some back meat that's
BBT_FLYF65k,7214239,7219599,caroline's favorite cut so i think we  should start with the one you like and  then work our way up maybe to the nose
BBT_FLYF65k,7219599,7225480,okay one lime oh i dropped a seed in  there
BBT_FLYF65k,7226239,7232639,well that bread on the outside is so  good it's just so crunchy that's amazing  right it is amazing the taste is very  good and i especially love the breading
BBT_FLYF65k,7232639,7238159,the meat the meat's a little bit dry  like to prepare to be dry have your  parents disowned you
BBT_FLYF65k,7238159,7245119,yeah  yeah i just never heard someone say oh i  like the dry meat i'm gonna put some  sauce on there
BBT_FLYF65k,7245760,7251360,it's a little spicy but it's delicious  great right  let's try the rib one man everywhere in
BBT_FLYF65k,7251360,7257119,mexico people love lime i've never seen  so many limes and avocados in my life  it's awesome it's our thing so are you
BBT_FLYF65k,7257119,7262800,ready yes let's go for it  wow that pork is delicious for me that's  a perfect balance little fan low protein
BBT_FLYF65k,7262800,7269119,very tender mild flavors that's really  good yes it is this is good but man that  is heavy is this everyday food every day
BBT_FLYF65k,7269119,7275679,every day yeah how many calories do you  think it's for one of these i don't  really want to count i don't want to  either i'm going to be worried after all
BBT_FLYF65k,7275679,7283280,if you were iffy on the ribs this is  really going to kill you this is the  snout oh know
BBT_FLYF65k,7283280,7288400,look at this piece right here i'm going  to do it for you this is basically just  fat now all the face meat is just really
BBT_FLYF65k,7288400,7294960,fatty  [Music]  it's almost like gummy very gelatinous
BBT_FLYF65k,7294960,7300080,that's the thing i hate about it you  know what most americans don't like that  texture the taste is almost the same the
BBT_FLYF65k,7300080,7305119,texture is the thing that i hate that's  a really good point you need to find  that perfect ratio for you between
BBT_FLYF65k,7305119,7311440,protein and fat i agree this is a little  much it's fun to try but it's super  fatty super heavy and just kind of gooey
BBT_FLYF65k,7311440,7318000,the question what's your favorite one  wow  of the three my favorite absolutely the
BBT_FLYF65k,7318000,7323040,rib you just have to find that perfect  balance between being juicy fatty but  still having protein but the
BBT_FLYF65k,7323040,7329440,presentation is my most favorite part  i've been here like five days i've had  one thousand tacos no a million and so
BBT_FLYF65k,7329440,7334719,tacos are great but you need variety  right yeah so the texture of the gordita  the way it's packaged up the way it's
BBT_FLYF65k,7334719,7340800,like nice and easy to eat  the crunch for me my favorite part is  seeing the huge volume here there's so
BBT_FLYF65k,7340800,7348800,much food he's saying he could put four  human bodies in there and 500 millions  don't forget it yeah 500 melons
BBT_FLYF65k,7348880,7355199,each country's cuisine is largely shaped  by what grows naturally in that given  geography these are so fun mexico is
BBT_FLYF65k,7355199,7360719,amazing i guess  [Music]  in mexico that means chili's this salsa
BBT_FLYF65k,7360719,7366400,is giving life to everything corn that's  a lot of flavor i just had a quinceanera  in my mouth and one ingredient i've
BBT_FLYF65k,7366400,7375750,never seen in the usa  this is something i've never seen before  this is a cactus that means cactus
BBT_FLYF65k,7375750,7383520,[Music]  today i'm on a mission to eat only  cactus and cactus dishes for the next 24
BBT_FLYF65k,7383520,7390880,hours to me i think the spikes could be  good for fiber just move things along in  the gut i didn't even know you could eat  cactus oh it's gooey and now my
BBT_FLYF65k,7390880,7397520,breakfast i can eat this raw lunch is  this a taco desserts is so moist drinks  it is cactus water with pineapple oh
BBT_FLYF65k,7397520,7403360,good i'm glad there's pineapple in there  all of it will be made using one of  mexico's most unique iconic native plant
BBT_FLYF65k,7403360,7408880,species and it all starts here  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,7408880,7414880,how far away from mexico city are we  right now we're about one hour and a  half away from the center this is still  mexico city though hold on out here this
BBT_FLYF65k,7414880,7420719,is mexico city mexico city is a big city  we're in the south this is milpal milpa  ulta lies in the southeast corner of
BBT_FLYF65k,7420719,7425840,mexico city 90 of this area is  agricultural land but one stands above
BBT_FLYF65k,7425840,7432480,them all  the prickly pear cactus or in spanish no  bud this place produces 80 of the cactus
BBT_FLYF65k,7432480,7438480,in mexico 80  i thought cactus just kind of grew wild  i didn't know people were farming  agriculturally do you have any idea how
BBT_FLYF65k,7438480,7443840,long it takes a cactus to get this big i  don't know but we're about to find out i  guess
BBT_FLYF65k,7444400,7450719,again  nice to meet you  meet anastasia she's a promoter teacher
BBT_FLYF65k,7450719,7456719,market vendor chef a little bit of  everything but today she greets us as  one who grows this superfood in her
BBT_FLYF65k,7456719,7464599,fields her farm is over three acres and  most of that is covered with nopales why  nepalese
BBT_FLYF65k,7466880,7473760,it was beans corn squash but in the 60s  the boom of the nopal came here this  vegetable was domesticated almost 10 000
BBT_FLYF65k,7473760,7480239,years ago by the ancestors of the aztecs  every part of the plant has found its  way into mexican life but most
BBT_FLYF65k,7480239,7486560,significant is how it's eaten when they  discovered the benefits of nepal more  people and more people were starting to  eat nepal and the business for them was
BBT_FLYF65k,7486560,7493760,going great so everybody changed from  what they were growing  today nopales can be found in many  cuisines around the world in 2018 it was
BBT_FLYF65k,7493760,7499440,given the title of hottest food trend by  people who like to give titles to stuff  it is super rich in calcium it is really
BBT_FLYF65k,7499440,7504880,rich in fiber so it helps people digest  things better and it helps diabetic  people reduce their sugar levels the goo
BBT_FLYF65k,7504880,7510159,from the inside of the nopal can also be  used as sunscreen do you have anything  good with you i think i need that right  now what makes it even better is that
BBT_FLYF65k,7510159,7517199,farming this plant requires almost no  effort just bury the pads and soil from  there the job is easy
BBT_FLYF65k,7517199,7523119,they don't need to water the nopales at  the rain will do the work so there's  just issues with different types of bugs  that try to eat it right yeah that's the
BBT_FLYF65k,7523119,7528560,main enemy but she said that a well kept  mobile won't have that problem after one  year these nepalese are ready for
BBT_FLYF65k,7528560,7534880,harvesting before people used to have  bigger neopales but it's recommended to  just have three levels of nopal because  it is faster for the nutrients to get to
BBT_FLYF65k,7534880,7540800,the plants  and her height helps a lot to be this  size if not she would have to go up to
BBT_FLYF65k,7540800,7547440,cut it right  a nopal tree can generate up to 100 pads  and a well-kept nopal can last up to
BBT_FLYF65k,7547440,7552719,seven years each spot that you see is  like a scar of the nopal it will never  grow back again in this spot but where
BBT_FLYF65k,7552719,7558960,you can see little spikes and little  flowers that will be an awesome day in  the low season anastasia sells 880
BBT_FLYF65k,7558960,7565280,pounds of nopales per week and that  number can double during special  holidays
BBT_FLYF65k,7565280,7572719,in the market there is three types of  nopales and it's based on size this one  is called cambray and this one is fenty  benti grande
BBT_FLYF65k,7572719,7579760,today mexican folks eat about 14 pounds  of these spiky snack pads per year can i  eat this raw it's in love
BBT_FLYF65k,7579760,7585280,she's gonna take the spikes up for you i  can eat this raw yeah no every country i  go to if there's a weird food i'm not
BBT_FLYF65k,7585280,7591840,here to see it right now usually they're  horrified and they think there's  something wrong with me but today she  goes uh yeah absolutely
BBT_FLYF65k,7593130,7598780,[Music]  boom so we got it right here wow it  smells like fresh cut green grass
BBT_FLYF65k,7598780,7604239,[Music]  fresco yeah it's really fresh wow the
BBT_FLYF65k,7604239,7609920,texture is so awesome the tiny bit sour  and a little bit tart but pretty mild  flavor overall it's a little slimy
BBT_FLYF65k,7609920,7616400,there's a little bit of goo is this how  people really eat it sometimes some  people eat it and even smaller ones have  you had raw before today's the day i
BBT_FLYF65k,7616400,7621440,guess  yeah you can get a little slimy  a little
BBT_FLYF65k,7621440,7627840,even yeah it's actually good  after farmer anastasia shows us her  cactus field chef anastasia will be
BBT_FLYF65k,7627840,7633920,making us some cactus dishes hola we're  now in your kitchen i noticed you have a  big commercial kitchen it's separate
BBT_FLYF65k,7633920,7639360,from the kitchen inside can you tell us  about your work here i said puerto  ranios three years ago she won an award
BBT_FLYF65k,7639360,7645360,with a cake made out of nopal and since  that moment she noticed that people  really loved her product so she started  building this kitchen so she could
BBT_FLYF65k,7645360,7651840,innovate in new products of nepal oh and  then we also have this dish right here  our first dish of the day starts with no
BBT_FLYF65k,7651840,7658320,pulp pads sliced up  and fava beans roasted on the stove
BBT_FLYF65k,7658639,7663760,she prepares a clay pot adding in fava  beans  water
BBT_FLYF65k,7663760,7669700,nopales  salt and epizote stems a pasta is a  plant like a nerve mexican
BBT_FLYF65k,7669700,7675119,[Music]  it's a little turpentine it's got some  interesting like very bold flavor to it
BBT_FLYF65k,7675119,7680880,as the pot boils she scoops out the  impurities that float to the top
BBT_FLYF65k,7681440,7686639,the best way to eat this is with a  tortilla this special tortilla is made  also with nopal what
BBT_FLYF65k,7686639,7692800,flattened dough made from cornflour  fresh nopal and cilantro this is the  first green tortilla i've seen i've seen
BBT_FLYF65k,7692800,7700079,blue and white  then cook it up on the flat top  these are cactus tortillas
BBT_FLYF65k,7700079,7706239,she puts in like a whole piece of the  cactus some red salsa and then she  completely disregards the beans and the
BBT_FLYF65k,7706239,7711599,beans are feeling a little left out  right now you should accompany the taco  with some beans people like to eat it
BBT_FLYF65k,7711599,7718960,with the outer shell and people like to  take out the outer shell whatever you  feel like okay should we both take a  bite at the same time
BBT_FLYF65k,7719119,7726239,ah another one please  cheers  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,7726239,7732159,it was really good tortilla is delicious  it's not so dry and crumbly it's got a  great texture to it and then the cactus
BBT_FLYF65k,7732159,7737280,is so interesting it's squeaky as you're  eating it your teeth are squeaking  against it i mean it's kind of boiled so
BBT_FLYF65k,7737280,7745119,it's a little bit soft a little bit firm  and it's a lot  slimy toilet venusable oh
BBT_FLYF65k,7745119,7750560,oh they're really good and then this  also just brings a little bit of cake a  little bit of flavor to it and it's  super healthy as well it's essentially
BBT_FLYF65k,7750560,7755679,vegetarian food but it's surprisingly  like meaty like when people put  mushrooms in a burger because
BBT_FLYF65k,7755679,7762560,they don't eat animals or whatever they  do because the mushroom still has a kind  of a meaty bite to it and that's what  that's like well done
BBT_FLYF65k,7762560,7768560,so much food around the world has to do  with just what is available to people  there then they take it and they find  ways to work with it and that's what
BBT_FLYF65k,7768560,7774560,people have done here for thousands of  years and that's what she's still doing  today what do you think could be done to  make this a more popular ingredient
BBT_FLYF65k,7774560,7780880,around the world it is the combination  i believe the key for international  success of nepal is combining it with
BBT_FLYF65k,7780880,7786639,other things a lot of people don't like  nopal alone or just grill the  combination of things and the whole  variety of things that you can do in
BBT_FLYF65k,7786639,7793280,nepal is the key to make it a success  and hopefully one day we'll all be  eating no ball but also still meat  because i like meat before we leave
BBT_FLYF65k,7793280,7798400,anastasia treats us to another dish she  created nopal soap with beef and cheese
BBT_FLYF65k,7798400,7804159,plus a side of cactus juice it is cactus  water with pineapple oh good i'm glad  there's pineapple in there nopales
BBT_FLYF65k,7804159,7810159,pineapple water lime sugar  here you have a fresh healthy slimy
BBT_FLYF65k,7810159,7815400,drink oh it's so thick cheers
BBT_FLYF65k,7816719,7821760,it is refreshing it's actually really  good it has some glue to it like it's  like drinking air it doesn't feel like
BBT_FLYF65k,7821760,7827280,you're drinking liquid it's almost like  the head of beer where you just like  drink the foamy part of the beer the
BBT_FLYF65k,7827280,7833280,whole thing feels like that a slimy foam  but that's pretty good right here this  is our main course this is awesome
BBT_FLYF65k,7833280,7839280,when i went to the market i had some  kind of a street food that was like on a  flat corn dough and then they put cheese  sauce and different things on top that
BBT_FLYF65k,7839280,7844639,flat thing is called atla but here  instead of having those carbs you can  use the cactus she scores the cactus and
BBT_FLYF65k,7844639,7849840,throws it on the grill  these cactus pads are joined by slices
BBT_FLYF65k,7849840,7854880,of beef let them cook evenly on each  side  then add cheese to each slice of beef
BBT_FLYF65k,7854880,7861280,wait for it to melt and assemble the  dish  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,7861280,7866480,finish with a hot touch of salsa cheers  cheers  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,7866480,7872000,we're gonna go oh excellent me amigo  everything comes really together it's so  smoky that's what i love about it but
BBT_FLYF65k,7872000,7877520,it's so gooey too dude  that's the part that throws me off every  time i pick it up i see strands of goo
BBT_FLYF65k,7877520,7882639,like a five-year-old that's just sneezed  but it has a wonderful smoky flavor that  has taken on from being grilled and then
BBT_FLYF65k,7882639,7889599,when you pair that with meat and with  cheese it goes together so well how does  it taste actually really like it once  you grill them it does get that gooey
BBT_FLYF65k,7889599,7895920,texture but it becomes really soft and  really delicious the beef is perfectly  cooked the cheese beans creaminess to  the dish and the salsa can never miss in
BBT_FLYF65k,7895920,7901199,a mexican dish oh i love the salsa  this is remarkable today i set out to
BBT_FLYF65k,7901199,7906400,eat cactus for an entire 24 hours so far  so good but what happens when this

BBT_FLYF65k,8176079,8182000,and the sauce makes it a little thicker  is it kind of like the way they cooked  potter pakoa with maggie exactly the  same use that they give them a game
BBT_FLYF65k,8182000,8188079,barbacua they use it with nopal in the  short rib  a spoon of mashed potato a nopal slice

BBT_FLYF65k,8231040,8237840,again but it actually conserves a lot of  flavor of the sauce of the short bread  it reminds me of okra because when you  steam or boil okra it gets really gooey
BBT_FLYF65k,8237840,8243359,and slimy inside the big difference is  okra when it's not boiled and not  steamed is like inedible but here you
BBT_FLYF65k,8243359,8249040,can eat it either way delicious raw but  when it's steamed or cooked it's good  too it doesn't hurt to have a 35 short
BBT_FLYF65k,8249040,8255518,rib next to it it never hurts to have a  35 dollar short rib next to something no  every perfect meal must end with the

BBT_FLYF65k,8282388,8288319,[Music]  it's like eating the watermelon green  it's a little cucumber that is a flavor

BBT_FLYF65k,8331598,8337598,little notes of cactus that's how rich  people wait that's how arrogant people  wait that's how um food reviewers that's
BBT_FLYF65k,8337598,8342638,how critics talk about food you have to  talk about notes you talk about front  end and back end mainly that okay you
BBT_FLYF65k,8342638,8348800,lost me  for me it's very cool to go from seeing  a food i've never really experienced at
BBT_FLYF65k,8348800,8354399,all in my life to just seeing it in all  its different forms and iterations going  from the field to seeing it locally made
BBT_FLYF65k,8354399,8360240,to seeing it elevated to its highest  potential here at this restaurant it is  very diverse and a very unique  ingredient an ingredient that will

BBT_FLYF65k,8394399,8399840,an inevitable universal process that  will eventually fall upon us all
BBT_FLYF65k,8399840,8406080,permanent  irreversible  death  the way we look at death has more to do
BBT_FLYF65k,8406080,8412560,with the cultures we grow up in than the  process itself  in some parts of the world it's taboo to
BBT_FLYF65k,8412560,8417760,bring it up  but in mexico death is celebrated by the  living
BBT_FLYF65k,8417760,8423200,in place of anxiety fear or sorrow  there's music

BBT_FLYF65k,8639220,8642879,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,8645450,8651120,[Music]  at least that's what most locals believe
BBT_FLYF65k,8651120,8658080,in the modern day day of the dead is  becoming more of a commoditized holiday  in mexico city there's a parade
BBT_FLYF65k,8658080,8667319,attracting thousands of people from all  over the world to gather in this ocala  or the main square in the city center
BBT_FLYF65k,8668240,8674800,but this parade doesn't go back  centuries or even decades it actually  started after a james bond movie which
BBT_FLYF65k,8674800,8683479,featured such a parade when it was  recorded here in 2015. now this is the  parade's fourth year
BBT_FLYF65k,8683760,8688880,giant skeletons and colorful costumes  mariachi music and dancers fill the
BBT_FLYF65k,8688880,8694880,street presenting a vibrant colorful and  somewhat commercialized slice of mexican  culture there's a lot of people in the
BBT_FLYF65k,8694880,8700160,parade was incredible the parade goes on  for four hours they must loop it right  they have a long ride around the city so
BBT_FLYF65k,8700160,8705840,a lot of people can watch it and they  don't have to be specifically here to be  able to enjoy the parade oh i could have  stayed at my hotel is that what you're
BBT_FLYF65k,8705840,8711840,saying maybe  most countries every holiday every event  has some kind of special food that goes
BBT_FLYF65k,8711840,8718398,along with it is that the same for this  holiday food is a big thing india de los  muertos
BBT_FLYF65k,8720240,8726160,when you put an altar to honor the ones  that you've lost  you put food and drinks that they love  because it's believed that they will
BBT_FLYF65k,8726160,8732080,come back at night and they will have a  little bit of that food and enjoy  themselves again in this world
BBT_FLYF65k,8732880,8740640,that's something we're actually going to  be seeing later today in the meantime i  want to see if there's any food around  here yes let's take a look let's go
BBT_FLYF65k,8743120,8750319,food is an indispensable part of this  holiday this time of year you'll find  skeleton themed candy skull chocolates
BBT_FLYF65k,8750319,8755600,or this a famous sweet bread roughly  shaped like crossbones set atop a golden
BBT_FLYF65k,8755600,8761120,yellow glazed egg bun they call it  dead bread and if you come here you can
BBT_FLYF65k,8761120,8767840,find a long list of varieties to choose  from all right right this way wow i feel  you're going to a stadium
BBT_FLYF65k,8767920,8774800,this is pandemorto which means bread of  the dead are these all a little bit  different yes each one is filled with  different feelings a simple sweet bread
BBT_FLYF65k,8774800,8780960,recipe  traditionally made from a rich dough  consisting of milk eggs and butter here
BBT_FLYF65k,8780960,8788479,at pastela ria madrid bakery they put a  twist on the traditional recipe adding  an even sweeter touch this one is hot
BBT_FLYF65k,8788479,8795120,chocolate this is super mexican this  flavor looks amazing i think i'm gonna  try that one this one is filled with  natta natta is made when you boil milk
BBT_FLYF65k,8795120,8801680,the fatty part that comes to the top and  they spread it in the bread okay we get  that too absolutely uh how do we get it
BBT_FLYF65k,8801680,8807200,originally i just heard his bread and i  was like well bread bread's not a big  deal but this this is more than bread
BBT_FLYF65k,8807200,8812780,this bread is only baked for this time  of the year it's limited edition after  the day of the dead it's gone cheers
BBT_FLYF65k,8812780,8818640,[Music]  oh yeah oh it's so rich and creamy it's
BBT_FLYF65k,8818640,8824240,fatty it's sweet it's really good  it doesn't get more fresh than that it's  very airy it's creamy inside and then
BBT_FLYF65k,8824240,8830800,crusty sugary topping yes you get a  crust on the top and the sugar gives it  all the sweetness that it needs this is  awesome if i was a kid i would love damn
BBT_FLYF65k,8830800,8836080,the dead based just on this this is very  nice all of them has this little button  on top does that represent anything the
BBT_FLYF65k,8836080,8842880,round shape represents the circle of  life and in here the crosses represents  the bone of the diseased one
BBT_FLYF65k,8842880,8850240,i'm assuming dave the dead began in  mexico but where in this country near  here with the aztec civilization
BBT_FLYF65k,8850240,8857280,the ancient ritual of honoring the dead  was started by the aztecs some 3 000  years ago originally celebrated in the
BBT_FLYF65k,8857280,8863920,summer it was moved to november 1st and  2nd to coincide with all saints day and  all souls day as the spanish brought
BBT_FLYF65k,8863920,8869840,christianity to central mexico in the  16th century both traditions mixed and  that's why you get a little bit of
BBT_FLYF65k,8869840,8875359,crosses and the essence of the day of  the dead it's a little bit of both  cultures melding together to make this
BBT_FLYF65k,8875359,8881120,holiday that you don't really see in any  other catholic nation  the sacred holiday has evolved into what
BBT_FLYF65k,8881120,8889521,we now see today but the way it's  celebrated still depends on the region  the town and the family celebrating
BBT_FLYF65k,8889920,8895840,i'm heading an hour and a half outside  the big city to a small town of about 9  000 people
BBT_FLYF65k,8895840,8901200,this is san pedro o'took pun no parades  no costumes soon i'll be meeting with
BBT_FLYF65k,8901200,8908720,the family who plans to reunite with a  lost loved one  tonight but first mole
BBT_FLYF65k,8908720,8915760,a food often associated with day of the  dead i want to find out why mole it can  be a sauce or it can be a powder yes
BBT_FLYF65k,8915760,8921680,which one do you prefer the sauce  obviously why is that obvious why do  they make a powder if the sauce is so  good this isn't the final form we have
BBT_FLYF65k,8921680,8927840,to still transform it a little bit so we  can coat our protein mole is an iconic  mexican flavor enhancer its depth of
BBT_FLYF65k,8927840,8934720,flavor usually comes from a great number  of oddly paired ingredients like dried  shrimp and cacao all ground into one
BBT_FLYF65k,8934720,8942000,fine powder i've not really had mole  ever it should taste like similar to  what the end form of the sauce is
BBT_FLYF65k,8942560,8948640,that's good wow there's so much  happening in there you can feel the  flavor of the mole it's a little bit  sweet spicy at the same time this is one
BBT_FLYF65k,8948640,8954080,of the most unique flavor enhancers in  the world because people aren't used to  having cacao powder or chocolate mixed
BBT_FLYF65k,8954080,8960080,with spices but this is something  altogether different it's very dynamic  has a lot of depth and the flavor just  pulls in many different directions
BBT_FLYF65k,8960080,8965840,that's fantastic  this is mole street all along this road  you'll find vendors selling pre-made

BBT_FLYF65k,9011840,9019520,chilis and everything whoa  a proper mole can easily consist of up  to 30 or even 50 different ingredients
BBT_FLYF65k,9019520,9026319,ingredients vary according to the recipe  but you'll usually find a mixture of  nuts fruits spices and especially
BBT_FLYF65k,9026319,9031359,chilies  here's other molasses like this it's  green it looks like matcha which i hate
BBT_FLYF65k,9031359,9038240,but maybe it tastes like mole which i  love this type of mole is a little bit  different it's made with green chili  they also use a lot of herbs and spices
BBT_FLYF65k,9038240,9044399,like the leaves of the avocado tree the  root of the onion  it's like a dried chili dust way more
BBT_FLYF65k,9044399,9050000,powdery europe do they all have cacao  powder this one does not have cacao  powder really i love the ones with cacao
BBT_FLYF65k,9050000,9055760,but i'm open to new types of mole this  one is orange this is called pipian and  they use chile
BBT_FLYF65k,9055760,9061359,which gives it its color and the seeds  also give it a little lightness oh this  like melts on your tongue like sugar
BBT_FLYF65k,9061359,9068790,it's sweet at the same time it's a  little bit spicy dude i want to mix all  of these with my own cooking and just  see what happens this is fantastic
BBT_FLYF65k,9068790,9073729,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9076560,9082960,this is sarah she's the reason we're  here  like most families in this town sarah is
BBT_FLYF65k,9082960,9088840,also in the mole business she's been at  it for 30 years
BBT_FLYF65k,9088840,9095120,[Music]  this is her factory where they kick out  over a thousand pounds of mole per month
BBT_FLYF65k,9095120,9100590,today hermole will be used as an  offering to a recently deceased loved  one
BBT_FLYF65k,9100590,9106000,[Music]  i ran out of spanish i'll take it from  here okay thanks
BBT_FLYF65k,9106000,9112240,i noticed this region it's so famous for  molding were you born in this area see  so you just grew up with this how many
BBT_FLYF65k,9112240,9118640,different types do you make  she makes three types of moles in here  this one that we're going to have which  is almendrado
BBT_FLYF65k,9118640,9124880,mole almendrado means almond mole  nice a specialty in this town consisting
BBT_FLYF65k,9124880,9130720,on average of 26 ingredients all roasted  or dried so the mole will last longer
BBT_FLYF65k,9130720,9136319,we have these in minnesota but for a  different reason usually for snow  and it's never snowed ingredients like
BBT_FLYF65k,9136319,9141600,this  oh it smells so good right  smells really good
BBT_FLYF65k,9141600,9148160,chocolatey  yes can you tell me what these  ingredients are platano chocolate
BBT_FLYF65k,9148160,9157120,galleta almendras avellanas nues  cacaguate pasas tortilla pan ajo nadoma
BBT_FLYF65k,9157120,9162399,oh okay good  the recipe you're using is this  something that was handed down to you
BBT_FLYF65k,9162399,9166800,something that you've developed or  changed over the years
BBT_FLYF65k,9167920,9174399,this is a special recipe it's from her  husband and her and they have been  modifying it three years to get to the  perfect recipe that they have right now
BBT_FLYF65k,9174399,9181040,wow  first they grind dried chilies
BBT_FLYF65k,9181040,9186358,then mix that with sesame seeds and  grind that too
BBT_FLYF65k,9191280,9197520,now all the ingredients are mixed  together and ground  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9197520,9204560,the one thing all moles have in common  is complexity an abundance of  ingredients and a time-consuming process
BBT_FLYF65k,9204560,9210640,not too long ago all this work would  have been done by hand using stone  mortars and pestles while still
BBT_FLYF65k,9210640,9218880,achieving the same fine powdery texture  considering the labor involved it's easy  to see how this became a treasured dish
BBT_FLYF65k,9218880,9225600,finally refine the mixture with a  different machine  creating an even finer powder
BBT_FLYF65k,9225600,9230640,but this is not its final form from here  sarah brings the mole home along with a
BBT_FLYF65k,9230640,9236880,couple other day of the dead staples  candied squash and candied sweet  potatoes
BBT_FLYF65k,9239840,9246560,late in the evening tucked away on the  hillside of this small town you'll find  a tranquil ambiance peppered with
BBT_FLYF65k,9246560,9251760,distant barking from alarm dogs  but this night is different from other
BBT_FLYF65k,9251760,9257439,nights  tonight this family is expecting the  brief return home of a recently lost

BBT_FLYF65k,9283600,9290239,can't help but feel i'm imposing on an  event i may not ever truly understand
BBT_FLYF65k,9292319,9298800,aside from the giant sprawling altar  things seem normal  the sounds of people making food and
BBT_FLYF65k,9298800,9304240,savory aromas slowly creeping from the  kitchen  preparing food for tonight's dinner
BBT_FLYF65k,9304240,9309359,sarah's sister lucia right now she's  making her father-in-law's favorite meal

BBT_FLYF65k,9328399,9333520,captivating walks of cacao nuts and  chilies finally she adds shrimp cakes
BBT_FLYF65k,9333520,9338640,and serves the mole with rice  [Music]

BBT_FLYF65k,9351840,9356960,something that is meatless completely so  they don't feel like they're eating the  flesh of their dead you know the usa
BBT_FLYF65k,9356960,9363040,meat is like from any kind of living  animal but a lot of people around the  world say meat to mean not seafood so
BBT_FLYF65k,9363040,9368560,you put a seafood and meat is like land  animals so we do have protein  technically we have shrimp and then
BBT_FLYF65k,9368560,9374399,there's also like a shrimp cake these  are the potatoes how do you say potato  papa oh it reminds me of my dad i'm not

BBT_FLYF65k,9488800,9494641,to bring closure to a difficult fact of  life that we'll all face
BBT_FLYF65k,9513790,9520479,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9520479,9527200,in mexico there's an ancient cooking  tradition that goes back generations  seems like something's about to happen
BBT_FLYF65k,9527200,9532240,see a recipe where the meat is cooked  with patience and the utmost respect
BBT_FLYF65k,9532240,9539280,what is that it's so full of something  this  looks awesome
BBT_FLYF65k,9539280,9545190,today i'm on a mission to explore  mexico's famous barbacoa  from the farm
BBT_FLYF65k,9545190,9550880,[Music]  sorry epic sneeze to the table have you  ever eaten testicles once but so long
BBT_FLYF65k,9550880,9556640,ago i do not have a fresh memory of what  they taste like you make some new  memories right now  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9556640,9562240,along the way i'll be unearthing some of  this country's most unique food it has  all kinds of insane ingredients but the
BBT_FLYF65k,9562240,9567680,one that stands out the most are the  worms and it all starts here a two-hour
BBT_FLYF65k,9567680,9573920,drive from mexico city hola  this is my first time being surrounded  by so many lamps and they also sneeze
BBT_FLYF65k,9573920,9579200,it's really weird yeah all i hear is a  bunch of coughing around me  meet herman he's a content creator and
BBT_FLYF65k,9579200,9584399,one half of the duo behind monks of  munch we're here because of you man this  place is yours can you tell us more

BBT_FLYF65k,9589600,9595439,here they have the whole process since  the bird of the ship to the sacrifice of  the ship to the cooking and all the way
BBT_FLYF65k,9595439,9600860,down to the table where they take it to  the restaurant in mexico city the  restaurant i'll be going to later that's  your restaurant
BBT_FLYF65k,9600860,9608000,[Music]  [Applause]  and all of this is called butter bacoa  yes so oh god one just sneezed on me why
BBT_FLYF65k,9608000,9613199,did i choose to do this what exactly is  butter bacoa
BBT_FLYF65k,9616160,9622000,barbacoa is an ancient cooking method  that involves slow cooking a whole  animal or several animals in an
BBT_FLYF65k,9622000,9627600,underground pit it's been used way back  since the mayans where they used to
BBT_FLYF65k,9627600,9633359,sorry epic sneeze keep going the mayans  this goes all the way back to the mayans  where they used to cook it in pits with
BBT_FLYF65k,9633359,9639120,volcanic rocks that were super hot i've  seen underground cooking in other  countries like omaha we want this to be
BBT_FLYF65k,9639120,9644800,airtight no air getting out but i've  never seen anything quite like this the  traditional way is with land but there's
BBT_FLYF65k,9644800,9650560,many other proteins that people use like  beef so you think lamb is the best as  you can see that's what he believes they
BBT_FLYF65k,9650560,9657040,look super tasty not yet but at some  point i'm sure when they stop sneezing  and chewing on me
BBT_FLYF65k,9657040,9662640,so is it all men in here i see a lot of  balls
BBT_FLYF65k,9662640,9668960,the females are used for breeding only  okay  she just so it's all guys
BBT_FLYF65k,9669920,9675680,what makes your barbocolloid so much  better than the rest  is
BBT_FLYF65k,9675680,9680800,[Laughter]  voices insist that half the incredible
BBT_FLYF65k,9680800,9686080,lamb flavor starts with the lamb's diet  wheat barley oats rolled yellow corn
BBT_FLYF65k,9686080,9692399,sorghum and a variety of grasses  this area is the feeding area where they  are getting ready to be sacrificed so
BBT_FLYF65k,9692399,9698080,they'll be soldered soon yeah  that is why we are in an elevated  platform so they don't have humidity
BBT_FLYF65k,9698080,9703680,they place some music for the lamp to be  relaxed and i'll be so scared at the  moment of the sacrifice we need to go on
BBT_FLYF65k,9703680,9710600,to the next stage and i think that  starts with getting out of here before  we get sneezed on anymore
BBT_FLYF65k,9711640,9718229,[Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9719120,9724720,why lamb and not sheep the main  difference is the flavor and the texture  it needs to be at 5 months and 40 to 45
BBT_FLYF65k,9724720,9730880,kilograms to be the perfect lamb  after being dispatched they begin a
BBT_FLYF65k,9730880,9739438,process i've never seen before an air  hose is used to inflate the carcass  before the skinning can begin
BBT_FLYF65k,9740399,9747040,aside from the blood and skin every part  of this lamb will be used in the dishes  we're trying today
BBT_FLYF65k,9747040,9754319,everything after the lamb hangs for an  hour it's ready to be portioned into  nine distinct cuts
BBT_FLYF65k,9758080,9771279,mr  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9771279,9778399,inherited this barbacoa recipe from his  father-in-law  how long have you been doing this
BBT_FLYF65k,9778399,9783760,is a family job  for himself 35 years plus of experience  doing barbacoa
BBT_FLYF65k,9783760,9788960,he said that nowadays we have a lot of  ways of cooking things and even better  methods but for him it's all tradition
BBT_FLYF65k,9788960,9791680,and keeping it alive
BBT_FLYF65k,9796800,9806399,with the meat ready it's time to put it  in the pit  [Music]
BBT_FLYF65k,9806399,9812720,the fires are made using encino oakwood  that's been aged for five years
BBT_FLYF65k,9812720,9818319,these fires produce an incredible amount  of heat as the wood logs reduce into  embers
BBT_FLYF65k,9818319,9824000,while the flames range on they prepare  the mega leaves  so i think they're cooking it for a
BBT_FLYF65k,9824000,9830399,couple reasons one is to make it soft  and pliable and two is maybe for hygiene  reasons maybe to disinfect it on the
BBT_FLYF65k,9830399,9837840,super hot corrugated steel i'm not sure  the mega is an ancient native plant in  mexico its utilities here are endless it
BBT_FLYF65k,9837840,9842960,can be made into alcohol used as food or  aid in the cooking process as we'll soon
BBT_FLYF65k,9842960,9850000,see  with the embers near ready moises  prepares the first food that will  descend into the fiery pit
BBT_FLYF65k,9850000,9855920,it's called  consummate a large pot of water  consisting of dried chilies garbanzo
BBT_FLYF65k,9855920,9861120,beans rice onions epizote garlic and  water
BBT_FLYF65k,9861120,9866160,the consummate settles on the bottom of  the pit  it's covered with a wooden lattice then
BBT_FLYF65k,9866160,9872960,mega leaves  the meat is about to go in you can feel  the heat radiating from this pit
BBT_FLYF65k,9872960,9879840,there we go  with the leaves each part goes in  there's nine different parts the  consummate will both send steam up
BBT_FLYF65k,9879840,9885520,toward the meat while also receiving  fatty drippings creating a rich  flavorful broth nothing's been
BBT_FLYF65k,9885520,9891200,pre-seasoned we have the broth and then  he just tossed a little bit of salt on  there and then that's it
BBT_FLYF65k,9891200,9897120,there's no complex flavor profile  there's no dry rub there's no wet rub  it's just about using the right wood and
BBT_FLYF65k,9897120,9902640,really good quality meat  on the perimeter layers of more mega
BBT_FLYF65k,9902640,9909359,leaves a lamb stomach stuffed with diced  organs and spices  then a clear bag made from the megaly
BBT_FLYF65k,9909359,9914720,known as michiote this mishiyote happens  to be stuffed with lamb testicles we'll
BBT_FLYF65k,9914720,9921840,get back to that later now seal the pit  with more mighty leaves and another  lattice then more mega leaves tarps and
BBT_FLYF65k,9921840,9926080,finally good old-fashioned dirt
BBT_FLYF65k,9927359,9933840,if executed correctly the protein and  the heat should be isolated from the  outside environment even the smoke is
BBT_FLYF65k,9933840,9942640,trapped inside  this sweltering cooking process isn't  complete until 16 hours later
BBT_FLYF65k,9942640,9948240,what helped you kind of develop the high  standards you have today  the standards come from her family that
BBT_FLYF65k,9948240,9953439,he was fortunate to have her in her life  and now they continue with that  tradition she started when she was a
BBT_FLYF65k,9953439,9959680,little girl and when they got married he  joined the family business okay so if  anyone is doing the quality testing here  it's you
BBT_FLYF65k,9959680,9965760,yeah  while the barbacoa roasts heiress to  this meat empire norma treats us to a

BBT_FLYF65k,10534800,10540560,fresh it feels natural it's so good but  it's also wormy it's not bad it's just  kind of earthy it gives it some cojones

BBT_FLYF65k,11417760,11424000,iberian and latin american cuisines why  do you prepare goat when it's so young
BBT_FLYF65k,11424000,11430080,for the tenderness of their meat and for  the pure flavor of the meat here they  cut the kid into big chunks and throw it
BBT_FLYF65k,11430080,11437120,in a huge pot of lard  here it'll comfy slow cooking for the  next six hours making it even more
BBT_FLYF65k,11437120,11443359,tender i can imagine how soft the child  goat is gonna be this is gonna be wild  the meat is shredded and tossed on the
BBT_FLYF65k,11443359,11449439,flat top joined by tortillas slathered  in peruvian refried bean sauce

BBT_FLYF65k,11467520,11472720,what's most special about this i think  is about what's inside just like us i  have no goats inside it we're about to
BBT_FLYF65k,11472720,11479200,but first we have to get through to the  bottom of it i mean it is soggy already  try it out all right
BBT_FLYF65k,11479200,11485920,oh  this coffee baby goat just shreds apart  this sauce on here it's like a mexican
BBT_FLYF65k,11485920,11491120,barbecue sauce and then the meat is just  so tender it is like a very moist pulled  pork where it's almost like little
BBT_FLYF65k,11491120,11497359,watery soft supple and sweet it has a  sweetness to it people around the world  are obsessed with young meat whether
BBT_FLYF65k,11497359,11503040,it's eating lamb in barbacoa or eating a  very young goat here the younger the  animal the softer the meat your meat
BBT_FLYF65k,11503040,11511359,would be very tough it'd be like chewing  on an inner tube and that's only halfway  how rough i am ladies and men next taco
BBT_FLYF65k,11511359,11517920,our final and most expensive taco is  made with bone marrow oh  roasted in the oven it's a bone from
BBT_FLYF65k,11517920,11523120,black house then move to the flat top  the femur the fever
BBT_FLYF65k,11523120,11530479,i was like is the bone more tender in  the cow joined by wagyu filet mignon the  most tender cut of beef seasoned with
BBT_FLYF65k,11530479,11537760,salt doused with two savory sauces bone  marrows gives all the flavor to the dish  it gives the punch once you mix it with
BBT_FLYF65k,11537760,11546080,a fresh meat it gives like a really  strong flavor to it melt acetero cheese  and top it with a corn tortilla
BBT_FLYF65k,11546239,11553190,finish with parsley tempura and yuzu  sauce  our final taco experience right here
BBT_FLYF65k,11553190,11559439,[Music]  wow every layer of this is incredible  there's a tortilla a crusty cheese on
BBT_FLYF65k,11559439,11565359,top of that then a thin slice of filet  mignon and then the bone marrow even on  top of the bone marrow they put some
BBT_FLYF65k,11565359,11572160,yuzu what's that a japanese citrus  japanese citrus and so it's 100  authentically mexican or japanese with a
BBT_FLYF65k,11572160,11577600,touch of japan  bone marrow is tricky right because it  can easily be too much of a good thing
BBT_FLYF65k,11577600,11583279,of course like you can't just eat it by  the spoonful you're gonna literally feel  sick it's oily buttery but kind of
BBT_FLYF65k,11583279,11590080,gritty too i think that's the bone oh i  ate too far  oh it just plopped out oh
BBT_FLYF65k,11590080,11596720,i'm gonna spread it now filet mignon is  known for having no fat it's the most  tender part of the steer they added this
BBT_FLYF65k,11596720,11602080,extra layer of fat it is a river of fat  uh let's take a quick bite
BBT_FLYF65k,11602370,11611279,[Music]  oh my god that's good that is wild what
