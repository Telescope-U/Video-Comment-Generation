evPjeN--pqc,80,1760,magic the gathering has some of if not
evPjeN--pqc,1760,4080,the best art in the gaming sphere while
evPjeN--pqc,4080,6160,some games like warhammer do come close
evPjeN--pqc,6160,8080,no one is consistent in quality like
evPjeN--pqc,8080,10000,magic is but with the scope to allow
evPjeN--pqc,10000,11440,varied and interesting angles to
evPjeN--pqc,11440,13599,approach towards their game we have epic
evPjeN--pqc,13599,15679,set pieces but we also have whimsy and
evPjeN--pqc,15679,18080,heartfelt moments we have the abstract
evPjeN--pqc,18080,21039,and we have the literal magic's art is
evPjeN--pqc,21039,23439,varied but consistently good it's
evPjeN--pqc,23439,25760,[ __ ] excellent but sometimes it
evPjeN--pqc,25760,27359,doesn't all go to plan throughout
evPjeN--pqc,27359,29279,magic's history we've had some suspect
evPjeN--pqc,29279,31599,art direction we've had some artists
evPjeN--pqc,31599,33040,blunder themselves even not
evPjeN--pqc,33040,35280,understanding the assignment or kind of
evPjeN--pqc,35280,37760,cheating on the assignment if you will
evPjeN--pqc,37760,39680,copying other people's homework and then
evPjeN--pqc,39680,41200,of course we've got situations where the
evPjeN--pqc,41200,43360,art on the artist is not to blame but
evPjeN--pqc,43360,45120,the community acts like a bunch of
evPjeN--pqc,45120,47280,[ __ ] children so in today's video i'm
evPjeN--pqc,47280,49600,going to talk about when magic art goes
evPjeN--pqc,49600,51440,wrong and yes that's dramatic and yes
evPjeN--pqc,51440,52559,the video is probably called magic
evPjeN--pqc,52559,55039,controversies but blame the algorithm
evPjeN--pqc,55039,57600,and blame yourselves for that but first
evPjeN--pqc,57600,59440,a quick message from our sponsor today's
evPjeN--pqc,59440,61680,video is brought to you by rem it is
evPjeN--pqc,61680,64320,absolutely no secret that the world is
evPjeN--pqc,64320,67200,on fire right now not literally but
evPjeN--pqc,67200,69680,almost climate change the climate crisis
evPjeN--pqc,69680,70960,is real and whilst i don't believe we
evPjeN--pqc,70960,72240,should be guilt-tripping one another and
evPjeN--pqc,72240,73680,that wider systemic culture and
evPjeN--pqc,73680,76080,political changes are needed i do think
evPjeN--pqc,76080,77360,that we can come together as a
evPjeN--pqc,77360,79759,collective to help solve issues this is
evPjeN--pqc,79759,81680,the ad read but stick around you
evPjeN--pqc,81680,84000,bastards it's important this week's
evPjeN--pqc,84000,86080,sponsor is ren a carbon footprint offset
evPjeN--pqc,86080,87520,subscription service you take a
evPjeN--pqc,87520,88799,questionnaire about your lifestyle that
evPjeN--pqc,88799,90079,helps you to understand just how much of
evPjeN--pqc,90079,91759,a carbon footprint you have and that you
evPjeN--pqc,91759,93200,were leaving behind
evPjeN--pqc,93200,96400,mine is not good i fly a lot for events
evPjeN--pqc,96400,98000,and for work and compared to the average
evPjeN--pqc,98000,100159,brit that does play on my mind a little
evPjeN--pqc,100159,101680,ren offers you the ability to pay as
evPjeN--pqc,101680,103439,little or as much as you want to offset
evPjeN--pqc,103439,104880,your carbon footprint and for that
evPjeN--pqc,104880,106320,reason i'm putting my money where my
evPjeN--pqc,106320,108079,mouth is i probably can't keep this up
evPjeN--pqc,108079,109520,every month and will lessen it in the
evPjeN--pqc,109520,110720,future but it makes me feel more
evPjeN--pqc,110720,112399,comfortable to be doing something and
evPjeN--pqc,112399,113840,what is that something you might ask
evPjeN--pqc,113840,115360,well it's not just guilting you into
evPjeN--pqc,115360,118159,recycling look i'm gonna be very very
evPjeN--pqc,118159,119759,real with you right now the idea that
evPjeN--pqc,119759,121840,it's all on personal responsibility is a
evPjeN--pqc,121840,123600,manufactured piece of propaganda by oil
evPjeN--pqc,123600,125680,companies to put the onus on us and not
evPjeN--pqc,125680,127759,on them ren didn't tell me to say that
evPjeN--pqc,127759,129759,but i want to say that because i
evPjeN--pqc,129759,131599,i feel strongly about this i want to
evPjeN--pqc,131599,133520,make sure that people are aware of this
evPjeN--pqc,133520,135280,but this fact doesn't remove the
evPjeN--pqc,135280,136959,personal responsibility that we all have
evPjeN--pqc,136959,138640,to fix what is going on i don't believe
evPjeN--pqc,138640,139760,it should be a pressure to obsessively
evPjeN--pqc,139760,141280,recycle although recycling is obviously
evPjeN--pqc,141280,142480,good before you tell me in the comment
evPjeN--pqc,142480,144000,section about that ren's goal is to take
evPjeN--pqc,144000,145680,the money you put in and put it towards
evPjeN--pqc,145680,148160,a wide variety of green initiatives from
evPjeN--pqc,148160,149680,funding policy and activist groups like
evPjeN--pqc,149680,151599,clean air task force to developing and
evPjeN--pqc,151599,153280,pushing for the use of biochar and
evPjeN--pqc,153280,155440,agriculture these are wide-ranging
evPjeN--pqc,155440,157599,changes and causes that if we get behind
evPjeN--pqc,157599,159519,them collectively can make a difference
evPjeN--pqc,159519,161280,you can start to offset your own carbon
evPjeN--pqc,161280,163440,footprint today on ren with the link in
evPjeN--pqc,163440,165280,the description below the first 100
evPjeN--pqc,165280,167440,people to sign up all have an extra 10
evPjeN--pqc,167440,169280,trees planted in their name helps to
evPjeN--pqc,169280,171440,support the channel it helps to support
evPjeN--pqc,171440,173280,a cause we should all care about right
evPjeN--pqc,173280,175440,then let's begin with lemmas or lemurs
evPjeN--pqc,175440,177040,or lemurs
evPjeN--pqc,177040,178800,do you know what a little year it is do
evPjeN--pqc,178800,180879,you do you know what a lemur it is
evPjeN--pqc,180879,182959,whilst ice age block was being made how
evPjeN--pqc,182959,184720,does richard thomas was sent an art
evPjeN--pqc,184720,186680,brief for the card
evPjeN--pqc,186680,190080,hippolotoris lemur yep that's right i
evPjeN--pqc,190080,191440,have no idea how you meant to pronounce
evPjeN--pqc,191440,193200,this [ __ ] thing it was referencing a
evPjeN--pqc,193200,195360,creature called a lemur or lima
evPjeN--pqc,195360,198319,something drawn from d d and fantasy a
evPjeN--pqc,198319,200640,spirit trapped on this world unable to
evPjeN--pqc,200640,202159,leave of course richard thought like i
evPjeN--pqc,202159,203920,would that he meant
evPjeN--pqc,203920,205519,the art director meant
evPjeN--pqc,205519,207680,lima you know the actual real world
evPjeN--pqc,207680,210879,mammal thus we got this card years later
evPjeN--pqc,210879,213280,we got a call back to lemurs in time
evPjeN--pqc,213280,214959,spiral with a card depicting them
evPjeN--pqc,214959,216879,accurately i guess with a playful bit of
evPjeN--pqc,216879,218159,flavor text from knowing the worry
evPjeN--pqc,218159,220480,suggesting that they were harmless until
evPjeN--pqc,220480,222239,engaged or close to
evPjeN--pqc,222239,223440,basically
evPjeN--pqc,223440,225519,i see this as a callback to the harmless
evPjeN--pqc,225519,228239,looking lemurs of the past personally i
evPjeN--pqc,228239,230959,would love to see a third lemur lemur
evPjeN--pqc,230959,232400,whatever the [ __ ] you pronounce it like
evPjeN--pqc,232400,234720,in magic that is again looks like the
evPjeN--pqc,234720,236640,mammal but with wings i think that'd be
evPjeN--pqc,236640,238720,a really fun full circle call back to
evPjeN--pqc,238720,240720,when an artist just didn't know what the
evPjeN--pqc,240720,242159,[ __ ] the art director was talking about
evPjeN--pqc,242159,243439,because they don't live in a fantasy
evPjeN--pqc,243439,244959,world and this is not the first time
evPjeN--pqc,244959,247040,either and surely will not be the last
evPjeN--pqc,247040,249200,mystic remora a commander staple and
evPjeN--pqc,249200,251200,frustrating magic card for many a player
evPjeN--pqc,251200,252799,it wasn't originally meant to be an
evPjeN--pqc,252799,255120,actual fish remora has two separate
evPjeN--pqc,255120,256799,definitions one being a type of sucker
evPjeN--pqc,256799,258639,fish and the other being a hindrance or
evPjeN--pqc,258639,260560,drag the interesting thing here is that
evPjeN--pqc,260560,262079,the etymology of the name of the fish
evPjeN--pqc,262079,264080,might be from the same root origin in
evPjeN--pqc,264080,266000,latin where amore is the latin word for
evPjeN--pqc,266000,268800,delay as ancient superstition of sailors
evPjeN--pqc,268800,270400,held that these fish would suck on the
evPjeN--pqc,270400,272639,bottom of boats and delay them or slow
evPjeN--pqc,272639,274720,them with their supernatural powers
evPjeN--pqc,274720,276639,either way mystic memorial was never
evPjeN--pqc,276639,278960,meant to actually be a fish but it's fun
evPjeN--pqc,278960,280800,that it is a fish right and that
evPjeN--pqc,280800,282639,legendary miscommunication lives on in
evPjeN--pqc,282639,284639,the most recent update to the card in
evPjeN--pqc,284639,286960,the recent secret lair uh product where
evPjeN--pqc,286960,289199,we're getting an actual fish mr gamora
evPjeN--pqc,289199,291280,again that said all of this aside
evPjeN--pqc,291280,292720,there's no excuse for it not being in
evPjeN--pqc,292720,294160,the commander legends product that's
evPjeN--pqc,294160,295680,kind of a topic for a different video
evPjeN--pqc,295680,296880,people on twitter were saying to me like
evPjeN--pqc,296880,298479,you know do these fish exist in the
evPjeN--pqc,298479,299840,forgotten realms could they have been in
evPjeN--pqc,299840,300880,battle for battles gate commander
evPjeN--pqc,300880,303199,legends to electric boogaloo and to that
evPjeN--pqc,303199,305759,i say firstly yes there's magic
evPjeN--pqc,305759,307520,efficient d and d for [ __ ] sake it's d
evPjeN--pqc,307520,309199,and d can be anything you want and
evPjeN--pqc,309199,312720,secondly yes because magical hindrances
evPjeN--pqc,312720,314240,also exist
evPjeN--pqc,314240,315440,mystical more should have been in
evPjeN--pqc,315440,317120,command's legends 2 and you cannot
evPjeN--pqc,317120,318800,change my mind one final and rather
evPjeN--pqc,318800,319919,fascinating example of this kind of
evPjeN--pqc,319919,321360,miscommunication comes in the form of
evPjeN--pqc,321360,323919,john avon not knowing at least initially
evPjeN--pqc,323919,327120,what a drake is and yes i mean that john
evPjeN--pqc,327120,329520,avon the legendary magic artist earlier
evPjeN--pqc,329520,331199,in his time with magic he was tasked to
evPjeN--pqc,331199,332479,paint something depicting a lightning
evPjeN--pqc,332479,334400,bolt hitting a drake the story goes that
evPjeN--pqc,334400,336800,he painted a bolt hitting a male duck
evPjeN--pqc,336800,338960,because male ducks are known as drakes
evPjeN--pqc,338960,341440,the story is now bloomed into this
evPjeN--pqc,341440,343120,come on wizards show us the original art
evPjeN--pqc,343120,344880,that art exists somewhere we want to see
evPjeN--pqc,344880,346560,a secret lair where a duck is being hit
evPjeN--pqc,346560,348320,by a lightning bolt the art itself ended
evPjeN--pqc,348320,350960,up being for pyrotechnics when it was
evPjeN--pqc,350960,353039,corrected it saw print here we see it i
evPjeN--pqc,353039,354479,think this card has some great art john
evPjeN--pqc,354479,356800,avon is fantastic the seventh edition
evPjeN--pqc,356800,358720,version has like a brighter hue to the
evPjeN--pqc,358720,360479,background like atmosphere and i like a
evPjeN--pqc,360479,362160,lot of my favorite pyrotechnics are but
evPjeN--pqc,362160,364319,the seventh edition version i only
evPjeN--pqc,364319,366800,noticed this today you can see the water
evPjeN--pqc,366800,368880,that adds so much more to the art as
evPjeN--pqc,368880,371440,well so for the record if any of you
evPjeN--pqc,371440,373360,cared are you taking notes pleasant
evPjeN--pqc,373360,375440,kenobi's favorite pyrotechnics art is
evPjeN--pqc,375440,377440,the seventh edition version
evPjeN--pqc,377440,379680,thanks for coming to my ted talk next
evPjeN--pqc,379680,381919,what happens when your average magic the
evPjeN--pqc,381919,383680,gathering player thinks they're really
evPjeN--pqc,383680,385280,good at something they've never ever
evPjeN--pqc,385280,387120,tried and no i'm not talking about your
evPjeN--pqc,387120,388880,average commander player chiming in
evPjeN--pqc,388880,390800,about the ban list in standard and no
evPjeN--pqc,390800,392080,i'm not talking about your average
evPjeN--pqc,392080,393440,standard player thinking they know how
evPjeN--pqc,393440,395280,legacy works i'm actually talking about
evPjeN--pqc,395280,396479,magic players thinking that they're
evPjeN--pqc,396479,398720,[ __ ] artists it all leads to a
evPjeN--pqc,398720,401039,[ __ ] weird backlash about faithless
evPjeN--pqc,401039,402639,loot i've done an entire video talking
evPjeN--pqc,402639,404400,about this particular controversy around
evPjeN--pqc,404400,406960,carly mazur's evocative and wildly out
evPjeN--pqc,406960,409039,their faces looting art it utilizes
evPjeN--pqc,409039,410720,block colors and unconventional
evPjeN--pqc,410720,412639,techniques to create a far more abstract
evPjeN--pqc,412639,413919,version of faceless looting than your
evPjeN--pqc,413919,416560,average magic player was used to or was
evPjeN--pqc,416560,418479,expecting don't forget the the art of
evPjeN--pqc,418479,420000,magic one of the criticisms of it is
evPjeN--pqc,420000,422000,that it has become homogenized over time
evPjeN--pqc,422000,422800,to
evPjeN--pqc,422800,424960,look like a cohesive world where there's
evPjeN--pqc,424960,427039,a lot of digital art involved it's got a
evPjeN--pqc,427039,428800,very photo reel to
evPjeN--pqc,428800,430400,look to a lot of conventional magic at
evPjeN--pqc,430400,431680,least until recently where they've
evPjeN--pqc,431680,433440,embraced alternative arts through secret
evPjeN--pqc,433440,436400,layers and um alternate frames like the
evPjeN--pqc,436400,438479,strix have mystical archives but the
evPjeN--pqc,438479,440560,backlash began primarily on reddit
evPjeN--pqc,440560,441599,spilling over to twitter and other
evPjeN--pqc,441599,444560,places that this art was just pure crap
evPjeN--pqc,444560,447919,it was just bad people took to insulting
evPjeN--pqc,447919,450400,carly's art directly and openly which is
evPjeN--pqc,450400,451680,kind of a bit shitty gotta be careful
evPjeN--pqc,451680,452800,with this stuff a bit there are human
evPjeN--pqc,452800,454400,beings making the [ __ ] at the end of the
evPjeN--pqc,454400,456080,day and people claiming that they could
evPjeN--pqc,456080,457440,given the time
evPjeN--pqc,457440,459599,do better than this on photoshop hello
evPjeN--pqc,459599,461280,claiming it looked like a bad photoshop
evPjeN--pqc,461280,463199,of course rather tellingly none of them
evPjeN--pqc,463199,465039,actually did any better no one made a
evPjeN--pqc,465039,467280,better version of i think the art is
evPjeN--pqc,467280,469039,wonderful in being so far outside of
evPjeN--pqc,469039,470879,what you come to expect and it fit the
evPjeN--pqc,470879,472400,thematic concerns of the mystical
evPjeN--pqc,472400,474160,archives perfectly it looks like an
evPjeN--pqc,474160,475840,illustration in some sort of crazy
evPjeN--pqc,475840,478639,magical text if you want a larger more
evPjeN--pqc,478639,480240,immediate unpacking of the controversy
evPjeN--pqc,480240,482160,at the time i'll link the old video in
evPjeN--pqc,482160,483599,the description below where i talked
evPjeN--pqc,483599,485199,about a similar note of parts of the
evPjeN--pqc,485199,486479,community losing their [ __ ] minds
evPjeN--pqc,486479,488720,over nothing and having a video and
evPjeN--pqc,488720,490160,packing it a bit more closer to the
evPjeN--pqc,490160,492080,actual time myself let's talk about
evPjeN--pqc,492080,494400,bearscape real quick in a little not as
evPjeN--pqc,494400,495520,much detail because there's a video on
evPjeN--pqc,495520,497120,it but i think this fits in the same
evPjeN--pqc,497120,498639,category right but escape was brought
evPjeN--pqc,498639,500080,back for pride month and it showed some
evPjeN--pqc,500080,503039,men of the bare body type uh gay men we
evPjeN--pqc,503039,505039,would assume being being close and
evPjeN--pqc,505039,507039,intimate with lovers in a
evPjeN--pqc,507039,509759,hot pool in short many a person claimed
evPjeN--pqc,509759,511759,it was sexualizing magic and they saw
evPjeN--pqc,511759,512800,injustice in that because the
evPjeN--pqc,512800,514560,sexualization of women has been lessened
evPjeN--pqc,514560,517279,in recent times and whilst i agree that
evPjeN--pqc,517279,519599,it has been we've stopped just being
evPjeN--pqc,519599,521440,borifying and having the male gaze
evPjeN--pqc,521440,523518,inform what we see of women and male
evPjeN--pqc,523518,525120,artists sexing them up
evPjeN--pqc,525120,526480,i don't think sexes are completely
evPjeN--pqc,526480,528800,absent from magic in general and beyond
evPjeN--pqc,528800,531120,that as well we have to then unpack the
evPjeN--pqc,531120,533920,idea that men being cozy with their
evPjeN--pqc,533920,535839,partners who are also men in a hot tub
evPjeN--pqc,535839,538080,is inherently sexual which i would say
evPjeN--pqc,538080,540160,it is not i think we just have to come
evPjeN--pqc,540160,541600,to terms with the fact that intimacy
evPjeN--pqc,541600,543440,exists between heterocouples and gay
evPjeN--pqc,543440,546240,couples and move on with our lives
evPjeN--pqc,546240,547519,full video linked in the description
evPjeN--pqc,547519,549279,below let's move on to the next one from
evPjeN--pqc,549279,551839,one form of angry bigotry to another
evPjeN--pqc,551839,553200,imagine the gatherings parent company
evPjeN--pqc,553200,554959,which is the coast band seven cards from
evPjeN--pqc,554959,556720,magic for having controversial or
evPjeN--pqc,556720,558480,racially insensitive themes and artwork
evPjeN--pqc,558480,560959,back in the summer of 2020. whilst there
evPjeN--pqc,560959,562320,is certainly some questions to be had
evPjeN--pqc,562320,564640,around the choices and the lists whether
evPjeN--pqc,564640,566640,they've really warranted full deletion
evPjeN--pqc,566640,568320,from the game at large and whether the
evPjeN--pqc,568320,570240,gesture was performative or not one of
evPjeN--pqc,570240,571600,the bands in particular made a lot of
evPjeN--pqc,571600,573040,sense to me and kind of justified the
evPjeN--pqc,573040,576399,rest invoke prejudice is a [ __ ] wild
evPjeN--pqc,576399,577839,card and i don't mean that unless it
evPjeN--pqc,577839,579920,does a cool and interesting thing i mean
evPjeN--pqc,579920,582080,that how the [ __ ] did this exist for so
evPjeN--pqc,582080,584399,long its name invoke prejudice also
evPjeN--pqc,584399,586480,tells us immediately what the flavor of
evPjeN--pqc,586480,587760,the card will be
evPjeN--pqc,587760,589600,in short it stops creatures that don't
evPjeN--pqc,589600,591839,share a color with those in play right
evPjeN--pqc,591839,593680,now from entering the battlefield unless
evPjeN--pqc,593680,596080,a tax is paid that's a pretty [ __ ]
evPjeN--pqc,596080,598480,rough start i will admit well it just
evPjeN--pqc,598480,601360,gets worse the r evidently has some kks
evPjeN--pqc,601360,603360,hoods in it and an execution of acts
evPjeN--pqc,603360,605839,accompanying that which in itself
evPjeN--pqc,605839,608480,invokes some rather
evPjeN--pqc,608480,611279,questionable ideas and then find out
evPjeN--pqc,611279,613839,that the original artist howard mcneil
evPjeN--pqc,613839,616800,is a literal [ __ ] neo-nazi and well
evPjeN--pqc,616800,618800,things go from an oof to one of the
evPjeN--pqc,618800,620800,largest what the actual [ __ ] in magic
evPjeN--pqc,620800,621839,history
evPjeN--pqc,621839,623760,i am not going to be showing any of the
evPjeN--pqc,623760,626399,artists non-magic art because it's all
evPjeN--pqc,626399,628720,really fashion nazi he literally
evPjeN--pqc,628720,631519,glorifies hitler and other nazi ideas in
evPjeN--pqc,631519,634320,his art he's a nazi there's no it's not
evPjeN--pqc,634320,635519,this isn't just someone on twitter
evPjeN--pqc,635519,636640,calling someone else or not they
evPjeN--pqc,636640,638880,disagree with he literally is and
evPjeN--pqc,638880,640640,whether it's a wild cosmic coincidence
evPjeN--pqc,640640,643040,or some purposeful shitty [ __ ] joke
evPjeN--pqc,643040,644160,on the part of the people involved with
evPjeN--pqc,644160,646800,the naming and number of cards the evoke
evPjeN--pqc,646800,649360,prejudice also had an assigned gatherer
evPjeN--pqc,649360,650720,number so a number in their database the
evPjeN--pqc,650720,653360,official wizards online database of 1488
evPjeN--pqc,653360,654880,which i'm not going to unpack in great
evPjeN--pqc,654880,656560,detail but you just need to know that
evPjeN--pqc,656560,658959,it's important to nazis invokes the 14
evPjeN--pqc,658959,660800,word slogan and it
evPjeN--pqc,660800,662720,shows a reverence for that [ __ ] hitler
evPjeN--pqc,662720,665440,it is beyond [ __ ] up that this thing
evPjeN--pqc,665440,668800,survived for so long even as a relic of
evPjeN--pqc,668800,671120,our past it is still there as a relic of
evPjeN--pqc,671120,673200,our past no one has gone out and burnt
evPjeN--pqc,673200,675760,all the cards so some of the backlash
evPjeN--pqc,675760,677440,about you know not respecting history or
evPjeN--pqc,677440,679360,some [ __ ] is completely irrelevant what
evPjeN--pqc,679360,682079,has happened is a corporation in america
evPjeN--pqc,682079,684399,has decided in the present day here in
evPjeN--pqc,684399,687760,20 or 2020 but 2022 to not allow fashion
evPjeN--pqc,687760,690000,nazis [ __ ] in their game and i for one
evPjeN--pqc,690000,692000,applaud them for that of course there
evPjeN--pqc,692000,694240,were some brave internet individuals who
evPjeN--pqc,694240,697040,stood against the tyranny of a modern
evPjeN--pqc,697040,698800,day company not wanting to allow nazi
evPjeN--pqc,698800,700000,[ __ ] in their games and claim that
evPjeN--pqc,700000,702240,everyone's being a snowflake i think the
evPjeN--pqc,702240,703920,real snowflakes are people who get upset
evPjeN--pqc,703920,705519,when we throw out
evPjeN--pqc,705519,708320,[ __ ] like the kk clay and nazis [ __ ]
evPjeN--pqc,708320,710160,that [ __ ] [ __ ] those people defending it
evPjeN--pqc,710160,711440,and then on the topic of idiocy and
evPjeN--pqc,711440,713440,weakness let's talk about plagiarism
evPjeN--pqc,713440,715519,crux of fate another controversy
evPjeN--pqc,715519,718800,involving strix havens mystical archives
evPjeN--pqc,718800,720320,oh
evPjeN--pqc,720320,722959,weird crux of fate by jason felix looked
evPjeN--pqc,722959,724720,great right i wasn't gonna nominate for
evPjeN--pqc,724720,726399,any awards but it looked decent enough
evPjeN--pqc,726399,728399,for a wrath but then we found out it was
evPjeN--pqc,728399,730240,a shocked version of previously drawn
evPjeN--pqc,730240,732800,nicobola's art of a piece of fan art no
evPjeN--pqc,732800,734959,less it turned out that felix had taken
evPjeN--pqc,734959,737920,a piece of fan art of nico bolas and um
evPjeN--pqc,737920,740399,raymond swollen's an original oogan art
evPjeN--pqc,740399,742720,for the card from khans and kind of like
evPjeN--pqc,742720,744079,shot them around and moved the arms a
evPjeN--pqc,744079,745760,little bit and basically composed a
evPjeN--pqc,745760,748800,piece of art in a hasty rendition of it
evPjeN--pqc,748800,751200,in what amounts to plagiarism now i do
evPjeN--pqc,751200,752800,believe there is an element of
evPjeN--pqc,752800,754480,transformative art that can be done with
evPjeN--pqc,754480,755760,other people's work
evPjeN--pqc,755760,757200,and i do believe that you can also
evPjeN--pqc,757200,759600,composite art from existing assets
evPjeN--pqc,759600,760880,that's a whole different branch of art
evPjeN--pqc,760880,763120,in itself [ __ ] it that's how collages
evPjeN--pqc,763120,765279,can work right but this was not that
evPjeN--pqc,765279,767120,this was a paid artist cribbing from
evPjeN--pqc,767120,769200,another paid artist but also taking
evPjeN--pqc,769200,771680,literal [ __ ] from a fan artist someone
evPjeN--pqc,771680,773519,who's not in the ecosystem and not
evPjeN--pqc,773519,774880,getting paid by wizards of the coast in
evPjeN--pqc,774880,777279,any capacity to provide art for magic
evPjeN--pqc,777279,779279,that's a lot different from creating a
evPjeN--pqc,779279,780560,transformative piece using other
evPjeN--pqc,780560,782639,people's or parts of other people's art
evPjeN--pqc,782639,784320,the art itself was taken from a twitter
evPjeN--pqc,784320,786079,user and illustrator for hire called
evPjeN--pqc,786079,787680,scary pet on the internet also known as
evPjeN--pqc,787680,789360,kit people now even get them to sign
evPjeN--pqc,789360,791760,their crux as a fate in a weird twist of
evPjeN--pqc,791760,793920,fate jason felix publicly admitted to
evPjeN--pqc,793920,796240,cribbing from kit scary pet and raymond
evPjeN--pqc,796240,798079,swan dugan and by cribbing i mean
evPjeN--pqc,798079,800800,literal copying pasting they explained
evPjeN--pqc,800800,803200,that they were overworked so
evPjeN--pqc,803200,804480,it was a moment of weakness in all
evPjeN--pqc,804480,805839,fairness but they even admit themselves
evPjeN--pqc,805839,808240,that's no excuse whilst i do believe
evPjeN--pqc,808240,811519,redemption is an important part of the
evPjeN--pqc,811519,813040,human experience i think people can
evPjeN--pqc,813040,814720,learn from their mistakes 100
evPjeN--pqc,814720,817200,hell i wouldn't actually kick up a fuss
evPjeN--pqc,817200,819120,if jason felix was invited back to work
evPjeN--pqc,819120,821760,for wizards again obviously on a one
evPjeN--pqc,821760,823519,more strike and you're out kind of pro
evPjeN--pqc,823519,825199,situation but the point i'm getting at
evPjeN--pqc,825199,826480,is that
evPjeN--pqc,826480,828000,whilst a mistake was made that i think
evPjeN--pqc,828000,829920,they can be redeemed from there's still
evPjeN--pqc,829920,832000,that sticking point of using an another
evPjeN--pqc,832000,834560,person's unpaid art and passing it off
evPjeN--pqc,834560,836079,as your own
evPjeN--pqc,836079,837360,unfortunate moment of weakness might
evPjeN--pqc,837360,839199,have really damaged jason phillips's
evPjeN--pqc,839199,840800,career i feel sad because it's evident
evPjeN--pqc,840800,843519,that they are still a talented artist
evPjeN--pqc,843519,845519,even if they did plagiarize
evPjeN--pqc,845519,846560,during a moment of weakness when they
evPjeN--pqc,846560,848720,were overworked it was rough to see i
evPjeN--pqc,848720,850480,really hope jason felix has learned from
evPjeN--pqc,850480,852480,that and recovered from it i hope their
evPjeN--pqc,852480,855120,career wasn't too badly hindered so for
evPjeN--pqc,855120,856800,miscommunication to audience
evPjeN--pqc,856800,859440,overreaction to literal fascism and
evPjeN--pqc,859440,861360,right through to a moment of weakness
evPjeN--pqc,861360,863440,where you plagiarized your colleagues
evPjeN--pqc,863440,864639,and people who weren't getting paid like
evPjeN--pqc,864639,866720,you were that is some of the times that
evPjeN--pqc,866720,868720,magic the gathering art has
evPjeN--pqc,868720,871440,gone bad oh we do love a bad boy don't
