TOaqMJpBeoo,4250,7359,[Music]
TOaqMJpBeoo,9519,11360,we've seen more details emerge just in
TOaqMJpBeoo,11360,12960,the last few weeks around these january
TOaqMJpBeoo,12960,15759,6 committee hearings
TOaqMJpBeoo,15759,17440,does any of that surprise you what
TOaqMJpBeoo,17440,18960,you've what you've heard have you been
TOaqMJpBeoo,18960,20160,listening to those i've not been
TOaqMJpBeoo,20160,21760,watching them closely i saw most of the
TOaqMJpBeoo,21760,24320,first one but um
TOaqMJpBeoo,24320,25760,you know one hand it's surprising on the
TOaqMJpBeoo,25760,27199,other hand it's not like it you reach
TOaqMJpBeoo,27199,29199,the point where nothing surprises you
TOaqMJpBeoo,29199,30080,but
TOaqMJpBeoo,30080,32078,i'm still baffled by the fact that so
TOaqMJpBeoo,32078,33120,many
TOaqMJpBeoo,33120,35600,americans still follow the president and
TOaqMJpBeoo,35600,37840,believe him despite all that we've heard
TOaqMJpBeoo,37840,39760,over four plus years now does it make
TOaqMJpBeoo,39760,41760,you even more concerned that he would do
TOaqMJpBeoo,41760,44320,whatever it takes to stay in power well
TOaqMJpBeoo,44320,45760,he would do whatever it takes to stay in
TOaqMJpBeoo,45760,47440,power that was my concern
TOaqMJpBeoo,47440,48800,certainly leading up to the election in
TOaqMJpBeoo,48800,50719,november 20. and i go back to folks who
TOaqMJpBeoo,50719,52000,say well why didn't you speak up why
TOaqMJpBeoo,52000,54079,didn't you resign i wanted to be there
TOaqMJpBeoo,54079,55760,at that point in time so that the
TOaqMJpBeoo,55760,57680,military wasn't used to either influence
TOaqMJpBeoo,57680,59199,the election or do something nefarious
TOaqMJpBeoo,59199,61440,after the fact that became my goal in
TOaqMJpBeoo,61440,63840,june of 2020 you kind of referenced this
TOaqMJpBeoo,63840,65680,but you do talk about your
TOaqMJpBeoo,65680,67520,concern that the us military would be
TOaqMJpBeoo,67520,68880,used
TOaqMJpBeoo,68880,71200,in the election in some capacity how
TOaqMJpBeoo,71200,73119,close do you think we got to trump
TOaqMJpBeoo,73119,75759,actually seizing voting machines do you
TOaqMJpBeoo,75759,78560,think he would have used the military to
TOaqMJpBeoo,78560,80720,uh instigate a coup i was very concerned
TOaqMJpBeoo,80720,82320,that somebody from the white house even
TOaqMJpBeoo,82320,83600,the president might reach into the
TOaqMJpBeoo,83600,85600,national guard either directly or
TOaqMJpBeoo,85600,87119,through the states and try to call them
TOaqMJpBeoo,87119,89200,out for one reason or another so look
TOaqMJpBeoo,89200,90720,there was enough concern out there by
TOaqMJpBeoo,90720,92799,myself and based on what i was seeing at
TOaqMJpBeoo,92799,94400,the white house that i wanted to make
TOaqMJpBeoo,94400,96479,sure that again that i was there in
TOaqMJpBeoo,96479,97840,place that i was a circuit breaker and
TOaqMJpBeoo,97840,100479,that could stop it did i think that
TOaqMJpBeoo,100479,102000,at that point in time that january 6
TOaqMJpBeoo,102000,104399,would be impossible no i did not see
TOaqMJpBeoo,104399,106880,that coming do you think that that
TOaqMJpBeoo,106880,109600,president trump instigated the mob to go
TOaqMJpBeoo,109600,110880,to the capitol
TOaqMJpBeoo,110880,112720,on january 6th
TOaqMJpBeoo,112720,115200,well i i i i think he didn't ascend he
TOaqMJpBeoo,115200,117200,summoned them for the weeks
TOaqMJpBeoo,117200,119520,prior he said you know come to dc on
TOaqMJpBeoo,119520,121280,january 6th uh you know it's going to be
TOaqMJpBeoo,121280,123119,wild or something like that you know he
TOaqMJpBeoo,123119,124640,he undermined the election for nearly
TOaqMJpBeoo,124640,126479,two months at that point in time uh
TOaqMJpBeoo,126479,128399,created the the big lie
TOaqMJpBeoo,128399,130000,he uh you know stirred him up that
TOaqMJpBeoo,130000,132800,morning so yeah of course there is i
TOaqMJpBeoo,132800,134800,think he bears responsibility
TOaqMJpBeoo,134800,136720,for that and more of this is coming out
TOaqMJpBeoo,136720,138480,now in these hearings that are up there
TOaqMJpBeoo,138480,139520,but uh
TOaqMJpBeoo,139520,141360,look i said at the point at the time i
TOaqMJpBeoo,141360,143680,sent out a memo the the day after june
TOaqMJpBeoo,143680,145599,1st to all of dod and i said look we
TOaqMJpBeoo,145599,146959,have a duty
TOaqMJpBeoo,146959,149599,to defend americans constitutional
TOaqMJpBeoo,149599,151120,rights to peacefully assemble and
TOaqMJpBeoo,151120,153120,protest now we have a role in law and
TOaqMJpBeoo,153120,155280,order as well supporting civilian
TOaqMJpBeoo,155280,157280,enforcement enforcement when they need
TOaqMJpBeoo,157280,159040,it if they can't handle it but first and
TOaqMJpBeoo,159040,161840,foremost we are a political body a duty
TOaqMJpBeoo,161840,163360,bound to live up to our oath and that
TOaqMJpBeoo,163360,165680,means guaranteeing americans rights
TOaqMJpBeoo,165680,167519,beginning with the first amendment you
TOaqMJpBeoo,167519,169519,sort of lay out as a turning point is
TOaqMJpBeoo,169519,171120,that june 1st
TOaqMJpBeoo,171120,174640,2020 protest you wrote that the game had
TOaqMJpBeoo,174640,176640,changed i wondered about his former
TOaqMJpBeoo,176640,178640,president trump's sense of history of
TOaqMJpBeoo,178640,180879,propriety and of his oath to the
TOaqMJpBeoo,180879,183200,constitution why not speak out then
TOaqMJpBeoo,183200,185760,about your concerns about him so often
TOaqMJpBeoo,185760,188159,when we face a difficult situation the
TOaqMJpBeoo,188159,189599,president would turn to the military to
TOaqMJpBeoo,189599,191760,solve the problem now of course
TOaqMJpBeoo,191760,193760,there are times overseas when you have
TOaqMJpBeoo,193760,195040,to do that there are times when you
TOaqMJpBeoo,195040,197040,don't but here at home when it was you
TOaqMJpBeoo,197040,198400,know the border wall it's not getting
TOaqMJpBeoo,198400,199680,done by the department of homeland
TOaqMJpBeoo,199680,201519,security who do you go to go to the
TOaqMJpBeoo,201519,202959,military the corps of engineers will
TOaqMJpBeoo,202959,205200,build it if it's coveted response you go
TOaqMJpBeoo,205200,208080,to the military if it's warp speed the
TOaqMJpBeoo,208080,210799,military so too often the president was
TOaqMJpBeoo,210799,212400,it seemed his first inclination was to
TOaqMJpBeoo,212400,214000,go to the military option or use the
TOaqMJpBeoo,214000,216239,military instrument but to your specific
TOaqMJpBeoo,216239,218239,question so look folks ask this all the
TOaqMJpBeoo,218239,221040,time is why not resign now right it's a
TOaqMJpBeoo,221040,222560,fair question or at least inform the
TOaqMJpBeoo,222560,224879,american public sooner well
TOaqMJpBeoo,224879,226159,how do you inform the american public
TOaqMJpBeoo,226159,227680,sooner you could have spoken from the
TOaqMJpBeoo,227680,228879,pentagon
TOaqMJpBeoo,228879,231840,um podium right and said i i think that
TOaqMJpBeoo,231840,232720,this
TOaqMJpBeoo,232720,235040,was a misuse of the military or
TOaqMJpBeoo,235040,237360,millionaire feel duped was something you
TOaqMJpBeoo,237360,239760,had said in the book why not speak out
TOaqMJpBeoo,239760,241680,more forcefully so i go to the podium on
TOaqMJpBeoo,241680,243360,june 3rd and of course obviously
TOaqMJpBeoo,243360,244799,publicly rebuke the president and say
TOaqMJpBeoo,244799,246159,that i don't support implication the
TOaqMJpBeoo,246159,247439,insurrection act but i would have been
TOaqMJpBeoo,247439,248879,fired immediately
TOaqMJpBeoo,248879,250959,it's that simple i thought
TOaqMJpBeoo,250959,252959,that given my oath to the constitution
TOaqMJpBeoo,252959,255040,that i was better off there blunting bad
TOaqMJpBeoo,255040,256160,ideas
TOaqMJpBeoo,256160,258720,and stopping outlandish ones and using
TOaqMJpBeoo,258720,260799,that position and to get us to the
TOaqMJpBeoo,260799,262720,election rather than going out standing
TOaqMJpBeoo,262720,264720,up and saying these things getting a 24
TOaqMJpBeoo,264720,267520,48 hours news blitz and then as we saw
TOaqMJpBeoo,267520,270000,in november when i was fired you had had
TOaqMJpBeoo,270000,271759,real trump loyalists in position running
TOaqMJpBeoo,271759,274639,dod for six seven eight months
TOaqMJpBeoo,274639,276720,you write after the june 1st incident
TOaqMJpBeoo,276720,278800,that you are worried for our democracy
TOaqMJpBeoo,278800,280240,at that point having served as donald
TOaqMJpBeoo,280240,281919,trump secretary of defense for about a
TOaqMJpBeoo,281919,284560,year i had seen many red flags many
TOaqMJpBeoo,284560,287440,warnings and many inconsistencies the
TOaqMJpBeoo,287440,289440,former president seems to be indicating
TOaqMJpBeoo,289440,291600,that he is going to run for president
TOaqMJpBeoo,291600,293759,again what do the american people need
TOaqMJpBeoo,293759,295199,to know i don't think he's fit for
TOaqMJpBeoo,295199,297280,office i've said so publicly as well i
TOaqMJpBeoo,297280,298479,think
TOaqMJpBeoo,298479,300080,public servants have to put country
TOaqMJpBeoo,300080,301919,first and he put his re-election he put
TOaqMJpBeoo,301919,303840,himself first above everything else and
TOaqMJpBeoo,303840,307120,i'm a reagan republican by the way
TOaqMJpBeoo,307120,308880,you have to give president trump his
TOaqMJpBeoo,308880,310400,credit he advanced traditional
TOaqMJpBeoo,310400,313600,republican policy objectives and he had
TOaqMJpBeoo,313600,315759,success on them rebuilding the military
TOaqMJpBeoo,315759,318240,lowering taxes deregulation conservative
TOaqMJpBeoo,318240,320320,judges on the bench you can go on and on
TOaqMJpBeoo,320320,322560,and on but i would say to my fellow
TOaqMJpBeoo,322560,324960,republicans is look you can get that
TOaqMJpBeoo,324960,326720,with with any number of candidates who
TOaqMJpBeoo,326720,328960,likely will emerge after the midterms
TOaqMJpBeoo,328960,330720,you can get that without the coarseness
TOaqMJpBeoo,330720,332560,without the divisiveness without all the
TOaqMJpBeoo,332560,335039,other baggage that donald trump brought
TOaqMJpBeoo,335039,337039,along because at the end of the day
TOaqMJpBeoo,337039,339199,we need a leader who will unify the
TOaqMJpBeoo,339199,341280,people and for the party we need a
TOaqMJpBeoo,341280,343520,leader who can win elections and because
TOaqMJpBeoo,343520,344720,if you don't win elections it doesn't
TOaqMJpBeoo,344720,346639,matter what great policy ideas you have
TOaqMJpBeoo,346639,348639,you will not be able to advance them so
TOaqMJpBeoo,348639,349919,that would be my and has been my
TOaqMJpBeoo,349919,351919,argument to to the american people and
TOaqMJpBeoo,351919,353919,to the republican party in particular so
TOaqMJpBeoo,353919,355440,you would not vote for him again if he
TOaqMJpBeoo,355440,356960,were no president
TOaqMJpBeoo,356960,359120,what are you going to do otherwise in
TOaqMJpBeoo,359120,361120,addition to that to prevent someone that
TOaqMJpBeoo,361120,363280,you see as a threat donald trump to
TOaqMJpBeoo,363280,364880,becoming president again will you
TOaqMJpBeoo,364880,367280,campaign for someone that you think is a
TOaqMJpBeoo,367280,368400,better candidate yeah well look i'm
TOaqMJpBeoo,368400,369759,waiting to see what happens after the
TOaqMJpBeoo,369759,372080,midterms when uh republicans start
TOaqMJpBeoo,372080,373759,announcing their candidacy and look if i
TOaqMJpBeoo,373759,376400,find somebody that has uh
TOaqMJpBeoo,376400,378479,i believe is independent and principled
TOaqMJpBeoo,378479,380960,and can unify unify us and and win
TOaqMJpBeoo,380960,382319,elections and certainly i'll get behind
TOaqMJpBeoo,382319,383440,that candidate
TOaqMJpBeoo,383440,384880,otherwise i'll continue to speak out
TOaqMJpBeoo,384880,386639,doing interviews like this and as i
TOaqMJpBeoo,386639,388240,speak around the country but look i
TOaqMJpBeoo,388240,389600,think that's that's an important role
TOaqMJpBeoo,389600,391199,for me as a member of the cabinet to do
TOaqMJpBeoo,391199,392560,those types of things and trying to
TOaqMJpBeoo,392560,394560,address these issues head-on has has
TOaqMJpBeoo,394560,396639,trump been held accountable for anything
TOaqMJpBeoo,396639,398400,only in a political sense only to the
TOaqMJpBeoo,398400,399919,degree that he's lost supporters and
TOaqMJpBeoo,399919,401919,people who believe in him and you know
TOaqMJpBeoo,401919,404639,you saw his base erode over time and it
TOaqMJpBeoo,404639,406960,certainly dropped off uh considerably
TOaqMJpBeoo,406960,409520,after uh you know after the election and
TOaqMJpBeoo,409520,412240,then again really so after january 6 so
TOaqMJpBeoo,412240,414400,politically yes to some degree but i i
TOaqMJpBeoo,414400,416000,can't ascertain that that's the
TOaqMJpBeoo,416000,417520,challenge with our system and that's
TOaqMJpBeoo,417520,419360,what they have to figure out what are
TOaqMJpBeoo,419360,422470,the next steps here
TOaqMJpBeoo,422470,425680,[Music]
TOaqMJpBeoo,425680,427680,one of the things that i thought was
TOaqMJpBeoo,427680,429280,more interesting that you talk about
TOaqMJpBeoo,429280,431120,kind of in a lot of detail in your book
TOaqMJpBeoo,431120,433599,is the withdrawal from afghanistan the
TOaqMJpBeoo,433599,436560,deal that was made with pompeo and the
TOaqMJpBeoo,436560,437680,taliban
TOaqMJpBeoo,437680,440160,you talked some about that canceled
TOaqMJpBeoo,440160,442400,visit to the white house that president
TOaqMJpBeoo,442400,444319,trump wanted to host
TOaqMJpBeoo,444319,447120,we saw what happened in august of 2021
TOaqMJpBeoo,447120,448639,almost a year ago now when the u.s
TOaqMJpBeoo,448639,451440,finally had a full withdrawal
TOaqMJpBeoo,451440,454000,what did you make of that moment and and
TOaqMJpBeoo,454000,456639,do you think that what happened um with
TOaqMJpBeoo,456639,458400,the deal that was struck during the
TOaqMJpBeoo,458400,461919,trump years contributed to such a messy
TOaqMJpBeoo,461919,463759,withdrawal from that country well the
TOaqMJpBeoo,463759,466080,short answer is not necessarily so i
TOaqMJpBeoo,466080,469120,think the the the problem was uh with
TOaqMJpBeoo,469120,471520,both both president biden and president
TOaqMJpBeoo,471520,473280,trump is they want to get out no matter
TOaqMJpBeoo,473280,476000,what so when you fast forward to uh
TOaqMJpBeoo,476000,478560,october of 2020 this is when the
TOaqMJpBeoo,478560,480160,national security advisor comes out and
TOaqMJpBeoo,480160,481759,says we're going to get u.s troops home
TOaqMJpBeoo,481759,484560,by christmas or by the end of the year
TOaqMJpBeoo,484560,486000,president trump doubles down and says no
TOaqMJpBeoo,486000,487759,by christmas which is that point is what
TOaqMJpBeoo,487759,489759,60 70 days away
TOaqMJpBeoo,489759,491440,and i pulled my team together both
TOaqMJpBeoo,491440,493360,military and civilians said look what do
TOaqMJpBeoo,493360,494639,you recommend i know what i think but i
TOaqMJpBeoo,494639,496080,want to hear what you recommend first
TOaqMJpBeoo,496080,498319,and to a person they said no we should
TOaqMJpBeoo,498319,500879,stick to conditions based hold at 4 500
TOaqMJpBeoo,500879,501840,troops
TOaqMJpBeoo,501840,503360,and make the taliban live up to their
TOaqMJpBeoo,503360,505440,end of the deal that was exactly my
TOaqMJpBeoo,505440,507360,point of view i wrote a classified memo
TOaqMJpBeoo,507360,509520,to the president outlining that and said
TOaqMJpBeoo,509520,511039,i do not support a precipitous
TOaqMJpBeoo,511039,513360,withdrawal from afghanistan but you know
TOaqMJpBeoo,513360,515518,the president persisted nonetheless
TOaqMJpBeoo,515518,517440,and then of course he leaves office and
TOaqMJpBeoo,517440,519518,president biden pursues what i would
TOaqMJpBeoo,519518,521518,call a precipitous withdrawal not as
TOaqMJpBeoo,521518,523200,much not as quickly as as trump would
TOaqMJpBeoo,523200,525440,have pursued but in my view what we
TOaqMJpBeoo,525440,527120,should have done and that's why i say up
TOaqMJpBeoo,527120,529040,front not necessarily so
TOaqMJpBeoo,529040,530640,what we should have done is gone back
TOaqMJpBeoo,530640,532480,and said to the taliban look we're
TOaqMJpBeoo,532480,534080,living up to our end of the agreement
TOaqMJpBeoo,534080,536240,you're not living up to yours so until
TOaqMJpBeoo,536240,538160,you do until you sit down with the
TOaqMJpBeoo,538160,539760,afghan government and begin serious
