5xbADDvciko,3220,10480,[Music]  sit on your bed one day and ask yourself
5xbADDvciko,10480,15519,uh  what's  what remarkably stupid things am i doing
5xbADDvciko,15519,21279,on a regular basis to absolutely screw  up my life  and if you actually ask that question
5xbADDvciko,21279,27519,but you have to want to know the answer  right because that's actually what  asking the question means it doesn't  mean just mouthing the words it means
5xbADDvciko,27519,34399,you have to decide that you want to know  you'll figure that's out so fast it'll  make your hair curl
5xbADDvciko,34399,40320,there's no better pathway to  self-realization  and the ennoblement of being than to
5xbADDvciko,40320,46800,posit the highest good that you can  conceive of and commit yourself to it  and then you might also ask yourself and
5xbADDvciko,46800,53120,this is definitely worth asking is do  you really have anything better to do  and if you don't well why would you do
5xbADDvciko,53120,60160,anything else  if you orient yourself properly
5xbADDvciko,60160,66240,and then pay attention to what you do  every day that works  and it i actually think that that's in
5xbADDvciko,66240,71760,accordance with with what we have come  to understand about human perception  because what happens is that
5xbADDvciko,71760,77280,the world shifts itself  around your aim  because you're you're a creature that
5xbADDvciko,77280,83520,has a name you have to have a name in  order to do something you're an aiming  creature you look at a point and you
5xbADDvciko,83520,90479,move towards it it's built right into  you and so you have a name well let's  say your aim is the highest possible aim
5xbADDvciko,90479,95680,well then so that sets up the world  around you  it organizes all of your perceptions it
5xbADDvciko,95680,100799,organizes what you see and you don't see  it organizes your emotions and your  motivations
5xbADDvciko,100799,107280,so you organize yourself around that aim  and then what happens is the day  manifests itself as a set of challenges
5xbADDvciko,107280,113040,and problems and if you solve them  properly then you stay on the pathway  towards that eighth and you can
5xbADDvciko,113040,119280,concentrate on the on the on the day and  so that way you get to have your cake  and eat it too because you can you can
5xbADDvciko,119280,125600,point into the distance the far distance  and you can live in the day
5xbADDvciko,125920,131440,and it seems to me that that's that  makes every moment of the day  supercharged with meaning that that's
5xbADDvciko,131440,136879,how because if everything that you're  doing every day is related to the  highest possible aim that you can
5xbADDvciko,136879,142400,conceptualize well that's the very  definition of the meaning that would  sustain you in your life well and then
5xbADDvciko,142400,148080,the issue is well back to noah well all  hell's about to break loose and chaos is  coming it's like when that's happening
5xbADDvciko,148080,154840,in your life you might want to be doing  something that you regard as truly  worthwhile  because that's what will keep you
5xbADDvciko,154840,160560,afloat when when everything is flooded  and you don't want to wait until the
5xbADDvciko,160560,166160,flood comes  just start doing that because  if your ark's half built
5xbADDvciko,166160,173760,and you don't know how to captain it the  probability is very high that  that you'll drown
5xbADDvciko,175680,181280,ask and it shall be given you seek and  ye shall find knock and it shall be  opened unto you for everyone that asketh
5xbADDvciko,181280,186319,receiveth and he that seeketh findeth  and to him that knocketh it shall be  opened
5xbADDvciko,186319,192159,that sounded pretty optimistic again  but but  again i think it's a description of the
5xbADDvciko,192159,199239,structure of existential reality and and  by by which i mean
5xbADDvciko,199920,205040,when i'm in my clinical practice and i  observe and this is also the case with  my students is let's say
5xbADDvciko,205040,210720,people's lives aren't what they would  like them to be  and so then you ask why
5xbADDvciko,210720,217040,well forget about tragedy and  catastrophe because that's self-evident  and we're not going to discuss that
5xbADDvciko,217040,224159,although the degree to which you bring  about your own tragedy is always  indeterminate but i would never say that
5xbADDvciko,224159,229360,every terrible thing that is visited on  a person is something they deserved i
5xbADDvciko,229360,236240,think that that's a very dangerous  presupposition especially because  everyone gets sick and everyone dies
5xbADDvciko,236240,241519,[Music]  but one of the main reasons that people
5xbADDvciko,241519,246560,don't get what they want is because they  don't actually  figure out what it is
5xbADDvciko,246560,254080,and the probability that you're going to  get what would be good for you let's say  which would even be better than what you  want right because you know you might be
5xbADDvciko,254080,260320,wrong about what you want easily but  maybe you could get what would really be  good for you
5xbADDvciko,260320,267440,well why don't you  because you don't try  you don't think okay
5xbADDvciko,267440,272960,here's what i would like if i could have  it and and i don't mean  i don't mean in a way that you
5xbADDvciko,272960,278800,manipulate the world to force it to  deliver you goods for status or  something like that that isn't what i
5xbADDvciko,278800,283919,mean i mean something like  imagine that you were taking care of  yourself like you were someone you
5xbADDvciko,283919,289440,actually cared for  and then you thought okay i'm caring for  this person i would like things to go as
5xbADDvciko,289440,295520,well for them as possible what would  their life have to be like in order for  that to be the case
5xbADDvciko,295520,303039,well people don't do that they don't sit  down and think all right you know let's  let's figure it out you've got a life  it's hard obviously it's like
5xbADDvciko,303039,308560,three years from now you can have what  you need  you got to be careful about it you can't
5xbADDvciko,308560,314400,have everything you can have what would  be good for you but you have to figure  out what it is and then you have to aim
5xbADDvciko,314400,319919,at it  well my experience with people has been  is if they figure out what it is that
5xbADDvciko,319919,324960,would be good for them and then they aim  at it then they get it and it's strange
5xbADDvciko,324960,331039,because they don't neces it's a strange  thing it's not quite that simple because  you know you may formulate an idea about
5xbADDvciko,331039,336080,what would be good for you and then you  take 10 steps towards that and you find  out that your formulation was a bit off
5xbADDvciko,336080,342639,and so you have to reformulate your goal  you know you're kind of going like this  as you move towards the goal but a huge
5xbADDvciko,342639,348880,part of the reason that people fail is  because they don't ever  set up the criteria for success
5xbADDvciko,348880,354479,and so since success is a very narrow  line and very unlikely the probability  that you're going to stumble on it
5xbADDvciko,354479,360000,randomly is zero  and so there's a proposition here and  the proposition is
5xbADDvciko,360000,366960,if you actually want something  you can have it now the question then
5xbADDvciko,366960,373120,would be well what do you mean by  actually want  and the answer is that you reorient your
5xbADDvciko,373120,378720,life  in every possible way  to make the probability that that will
5xbADDvciko,378720,383759,occur as certain as possible and that's  a sacrificial idea right it's like you
5xbADDvciko,383759,390720,don't get everything  obviously you  obviously  but maybe you can have what you need
5xbADDvciko,390720,396720,and maybe all you have to do to get it  is ask but asking isn't
5xbADDvciko,396720,402160,a whim or or today's wish  it's like you have to be deadly serious
5xbADDvciko,402160,407680,about it you have to think okay like i'm  taking stock of myself  and if i was going to live properly in
5xbADDvciko,407680,414160,the world and i was going to  set myself up  such that being would justify itself in
5xbADDvciko,414160,420319,my estimation and i don't mean as a  harsh judge exactly what is it that i  would aim at
5xbADDvciko,420319,426080,and so the issue is  not so much the blindness of others even  though
5xbADDvciko,426080,431440,there's as much blindness  among others as there is  in
5xbADDvciko,431440,437520,as there is for you but the issue here  the advice here the description here is
5xbADDvciko,437520,442960,you should be concerned about what's  interfering with your own vision first  and you should leave other people to
5xbADDvciko,442960,448160,hell alone in relationship to that and  so if your mode of being in the world is
5xbADDvciko,448160,453520,if you would just act better things  would improve for me  or if
5xbADDvciko,453520,459520,you identify the evil and the  catastrophe as something that's outside  that someone else needs to fix or that
5xbADDvciko,459520,465039,someone's response someone else is  responsible for then you're not going to  fix that
5xbADDvciko,465039,470400,and you're going to remain blind to the  things that you're doing and not doing  that make things not go well
5xbADDvciko,470400,477599,and so it's just better to think all  right i'm probably blind in many many  ways and maybe there are some ways that
5xbADDvciko,477599,483280,i could rectify that because it's highly  probable that you're blind in all sorts  of ways i mean it's in fact it's
5xbADDvciko,483280,489039,virtually certain and so  it's just more useful to think
5xbADDvciko,489039,495599,how is it that i'm wrong in this  situation i'll tell you something that i  learned to do  when i was arguing with my wife which
5xbADDvciko,495599,502000,happened quite frequently  because  when you actually communicate with  people you find out that there's many
5xbADDvciko,502000,507520,things that you don't agree on and  that's because you're actually different  creatures and so if you're actually
5xbADDvciko,507520,512719,going to have a truthful conversation  then you're going to find out that  you don't see things the same way and
5xbADDvciko,512719,518959,then you can either pretend that that's  not the case and gloss over it and then  end up in a 30-year
5xbADDvciko,518959,524000,silent war  or you can  or you can have the damn fight when you
5xbADDvciko,524000,529680,need to have it and see if you can  straighten it out  so now and then we'd get in a situation
5xbADDvciko,529680,535360,where we were at loggerheads we couldn't  move  and  you know it would spiral up into hate
5xbADDvciko,535360,541920,speech let's say because yeah everyone  laughs because they know they manifest  plenty of hate speech towards those they
5xbADDvciko,541920,549360,love  so  one of the things we learned to do was  when we  hit an impasse was to separate and
5xbADDvciko,549360,555760,to go  our own ways and to go sit and think  okay look we're at this
5xbADDvciko,555760,562720,unpleasant situation we can't figure out  how to move forward  i'd always think  of course it's her fault obviously it's
5xbADDvciko,562720,568080,her fault  at least 95  but
5xbADDvciko,568080,575640,maybe there was something i did that  contributed like 5 to it
5xbADDvciko,576880,582800,if you do what  it is that you're called upon to do  which is to lift your eyes up above the
5xbADDvciko,582800,589519,mundane  daily selfish impulsive issues that  might beset you and attempt to enter
5xbADDvciko,589519,595839,into a contractual relationship with  that which you might hold in the highest  regard whatever that might be to aim
5xbADDvciko,595839,602560,high and to make that important above  all else in your life that that  fortifies you against the vicissitudes
5xbADDvciko,602560,608640,of existence like nothing else can and i  truly believe that that's the most  practical advice
5xbADDvciko,608640,614160,that you could possibly receive  the way that you fortify your faith in
5xbADDvciko,614160,620480,life is to assume the best something  like that and then to act courageously  in relationship to that
5xbADDvciko,620480,626160,and and that's that's tantamount to  expressing your faith in the highest  possible good it's tantamount to
5xbADDvciko,626160,632320,expressing your faith in god and it's  not a matter of stating well i believe  in the existence of a transcendent deity
5xbADDvciko,632320,638880,because in some sense who cares who  cares what you believe i mean you might  and all that but but that's not the
5xbADDvciko,638880,644560,issue that's not the issue the issue it  seems to me is how you act  [Music]
5xbADDvciko,644560,652079,the issue is not what you believe as if  it's a set of facts but how you conduct  yourself in the world
5xbADDvciko,652079,659120,the purpose of thinking is to let your  thoughts die instead of you  it's a brilliant notion and so the idea
5xbADDvciko,659120,664160,is something like  [Music]  you can conjure up a representation of
5xbADDvciko,664160,670720,yourself you can conjure up a variety of  potential representations of yourself  into in the future you can lay out how
5xbADDvciko,670720,676320,those future representations of yourself  are likely to prevail or fail you can
5xbADDvciko,676320,683519,call the potential use in the future  that will fail and then you can embody  the ones that will succeed
5xbADDvciko,683519,688800,you do that  well simultaneously  conjuring up a representation of your
5xbADDvciko,688800,694560,current state and determining for  yourself  because of your undue suffering which
5xbADDvciko,694560,700240,elements of your pathetic being need to  be given up so that you can move forward  into that future
5xbADDvciko,700240,708079,and the goal what is it that you're  aiming at with that work and that  sacrifice that's the ultimate question
5xbADDvciko,708079,713600,what is it that you're trying to do  you're trying to improve the future  we believe that the future can be
5xbADDvciko,713600,719440,improved we believe that it can be  improved as a consequence of our  sacrificial work and so once again what
5xbADDvciko,719440,726079,are the limitations what are the limits  to that what are the necessary limits to  that i would say we don't know
5xbADDvciko,726160,733200,we conjured up this remarkable idea the  future exists we can see it even though  it's only potential we can adjust our
5xbADDvciko,733200,740880,behavior in the present in order to  maximize our probability of success in  the future how best to do that
5xbADDvciko,740880,749760,well the idea is something  like don't  hesitate to offer the ultimate sacrifice
5xbADDvciko,749760,754880,if you want the future to turn out  ultimately well
5xbADDvciko,755680,762480,what is it that you could  contract for let's say
5xbADDvciko,762480,768639,if you were willing to give up  everything about you that's weak and  unworthy  [Music]
5xbADDvciko,768639,774160,the proper  sacrificial attitude  produces
5xbADDvciko,774160,781760,a psychological state  and then a social state that's a  manifestation of that attitude
5xbADDvciko,781760,787040,that  decreases the probability that the world  will careen into hell
5xbADDvciko,787040,792160,and increases the probability that  people will live high quality
5xbADDvciko,792160,798560,meaningful private lives in a society  that's balanced and capable of  supporting that
5xbADDvciko,798560,804320,and none of that seems to me to be  questionable
5xbADDvciko,804320,809839,really  i also don't think it's anything that  people don't actually know
5xbADDvciko,809839,815440,you know people have told me many times  that  when they listen to me talk
5xbADDvciko,815440,821040,they're hearing things that they already  knew but didn't know how to say it's  something like that and this is one of
5xbADDvciko,821040,826320,those things that i think is exactly  like that i mean i think it's at the  very core of our moral knowledge and
5xbADDvciko,826320,832800,which is our behavioral knowledge and  our perceptual knowledge i mean let's  get this straight moral knowledge is no  trivial matter it's knowledge about how
5xbADDvciko,832800,838079,it is that you orient yourself in the  world there's no more profoundly  necessary form of knowledge well it's
5xbADDvciko,838079,843600,predicated on on something that's  exactly like this we know that we have  to make sacrifices we know that we have
5xbADDvciko,843600,849360,to aim at what's good so then why isn't  that we don't aim at what's best and  make the sacrifices that are necessary
5xbADDvciko,849360,855440,in order to bring that into play  i think  it seems to me that in some sense that's
5xbADDvciko,855440,861040,self-evident  the question is why we don't do it but  there's answers to that too
5xbADDvciko,861040,866160,life is hard and it hurts people  it's rife with limitation
5xbADDvciko,866160,872480,and some of it's arbitrary and some of  it's unjust and some of it's worse some  of it's malevolent which is even worse
5xbADDvciko,872480,878000,it's not surprising that that  combination of vicissitude can turn  people against being but i think even
5xbADDvciko,878000,885680,when that happens and even when people  have the kind of history  that if they revealed to you you would
5xbADDvciko,885680,891600,say well it's no wonder you turned out  that way  the people who turn out that way still
5xbADDvciko,891600,897600,know that it's wrong they still know  that however deep their own suffering  however arbitrary their own suffering
5xbADDvciko,897600,904320,however much that's caused by the  malevolence of others as well as the  tragedy of existence that that does not
5xbADDvciko,904320,911680,in any way justify their turning away  from the good  and i believe everyone knows that
5xbADDvciko,911680,916880,i believe that  they know it implicitly even if they  don't allow themselves to know it
5xbADDvciko,916880,923040,explicitly and i believe that if they  violate that idea then they violate  themselves and that they end up in
5xbADDvciko,923040,930000,kane's position which is the position of  the man who's been given a punishment  that is too great to bear
5xbADDvciko,930320,936880,now we're capable of making  sacrifices in abstraction right to
5xbADDvciko,936880,943440,conceptualize a future that we want to  let go of the things that are stopping  us from moving forward and to free
5xbADDvciko,943440,948399,ourselves from the chains of our  original preconceptions
5xbADDvciko,948639,956399,pursue pleasure  follow your impulses live for the moment  do what's expedient
5xbADDvciko,956959,963360,a mountain is something you have to  climb and you have to climb to the  pinnacle of a mountain and the mountain  is up right and the mountain stretches
5xbADDvciko,963360,969120,up to heaven and it's a long journey to  specify the right place on the highest  pinnacle
5xbADDvciko,969120,974720,and and that's symbolic because of  course it's a pinnacle that you're  always trying to reach just like you're
5xbADDvciko,974720,980079,always trying to aim you're always  trying to climb upward at least that's  the theory depends to some degree of
5xbADDvciko,980079,986320,course on your definition of upward  you're supposed to again to act out the
5xbADDvciko,986320,991440,highest good of which you're capable now  that'll transform your life to some  degree into an archetypal adventure
5xbADDvciko,991440,997199,there's no way around that because as  you attempt to  climb a higher mountain let's say or to
5xbADDvciko,997199,1003440,aim at a higher target or something like  that then the things around you will  become increasingly dramatic and of
5xbADDvciko,1003440,1010079,import that happens by necessity  obviously because if you're aiming at  something difficult and profound and
5xbADDvciko,1010079,1015279,you're really working at it then your  life is going to become perhaps  increasingly difficult and profound but
5xbADDvciko,1015279,1021040,that might be okay you might that might  be exactly what you need  as an antidote to the implicit
5xbADDvciko,1021040,1028160,limitations that face you as a human  being  [Music]  the good father is precisely someone who
5xbADDvciko,1028160,1034640,is willing to sacrifice this child to  the ultimate good  you have a moral obligation as a parent
5xbADDvciko,1034640,1040079,to  encourage your child to go out into the  world right
5xbADDvciko,1040079,1047360,and to be  whoever they can be  to be the best they can possibly be
5xbADDvciko,1047360,1054400,and in doing that you're encouraging  them  to  pursue the good you're sacrificing them
5xbADDvciko,1054400,1061200,to the good  you're not keeping them for yourself  selfishly  you're telling them that they can go out
5xbADDvciko,1061200,1067840,and live their life and live it properly  you don't want for your son
5xbADDvciko,1067840,1073360,what it is that you want for him  you want for your son
5xbADDvciko,1073360,1081440,what would be best for him and for the  world  and you let go in precise proportion to
5xbADDvciko,1081440,1087360,your desire to have that happen  when you have an infant you do  everything for the infant because the
5xbADDvciko,1087360,1092640,infant can do nothing for him or herself  but as the infant matures and is
5xbADDvciko,1092640,1099360,increasingly capable  of doing things for him or herself then  you pull back right you pull back and
5xbADDvciko,1099360,1105360,every time the child develops the  ability to do something you allow them  or encourage them to do it and you don't
5xbADDvciko,1105360,1110400,interfere you know so if your child is  struggling getting dressed well  obviously there's sometimes that you
5xbADDvciko,1110400,1116000,help them but mostly you let them learn  so that they can know how to do it in  the future that's better for you and
5xbADDvciko,1116000,1122480,it's certainly better for them there's a  rule if you're working with the elderly  in an old age home and the rule is  something like
5xbADDvciko,1122480,1127840,don't do anything for any of the guests  let's say that they can do for  themselves
5xbADDvciko,1127840,1133120,because you compromise their  independence and so as a mother you pull  back and you pull back and you let your
5xbADDvciko,1133120,1138400,child hit him or herself against the  world and you fail to protect them
5xbADDvciko,1138400,1143679,but by failing to protect them you  encourage and ennoble them
5xbADDvciko,1143679,1149760,to the point where you're no longer  necessary  now they may still want to see you and  it would be wonderful if that was the
5xbADDvciko,1149760,1156880,case but the point is is that you're  supposed to remove yourself from the  equation by encouraging your child to be
5xbADDvciko,1156880,1164640,the best possible person  that person can be  and you sacrifice your desires
5xbADDvciko,1164640,1170720,all of your desires to that your  personal desires even your desires for  your child in relationship to you
5xbADDvciko,1170720,1176640,because you want them to move forward  into the world as a light right as a  light on a hill that's what you want if
5xbADDvciko,1176640,1183840,you have any sense  and so you don't get to keep your  children at home because you need them
5xbADDvciko,1183840,1189280,how do we come to know ourselves in  terms of our personalities and more  importantly potential
5xbADDvciko,1189280,1195360,one of the first ways to come to know  yourself is to understand that you don't  you know you can learn to kind of watch
5xbADDvciko,1195360,1200559,yourself like you're watching a stranger  so you have to understand that you don't  know who you are
5xbADDvciko,1200559,1206400,and that's not easy to understand  because you think you know but then you  know you remember
5xbADDvciko,1206400,1211919,you can't control yourself very well  you're not very disciplined you're full  of flaws maybe you don't know yourself
5xbADDvciko,1211919,1216960,as well as you think  but it's hard to get  low enough
5xbADDvciko,1216960,1223840,to  understand  how deeply it is the case that you are  ignorant about who you are
5xbADDvciko,1223840,1230559,now there's an upside to that too which  also is that you're also ignorant about  who you could be and so the discovery of
5xbADDvciko,1230559,1236960,that  you know is  some reward for the  horror of determining who you actually
5xbADDvciko,1236960,1244320,are  then you watch yourself you watch  yourself like you're watching a stranger  you watch what you say and you listen
5xbADDvciko,1244320,1249440,you think what what sort of person would  say that and how am i reacting  emotionally when i'm communicating in
5xbADDvciko,1249440,1254799,that manner  you know is that making me feel stronger  weaker is it is it is filling me with
5xbADDvciko,1254799,1260159,shame is it helping my confidence am i  laying out a lie am i deceiving
5xbADDvciko,1260159,1266720,myself and other people am i adopting  this personality at parties that is  designed to impress and to amuse and it
5xbADDvciko,1266720,1273440,comes across as nothing but like  self-centered narcissism  um what are my dark fantasies what are
5xbADDvciko,1273440,1279679,my aggressive  fantasies what is it that i'm willing to  do what am i interested in so that i'll
5xbADDvciko,1279679,1286080,spontaneously pursue it what do i  procrastinate about and why what am i  unwilling to do
5xbADDvciko,1286080,1292159,what do i think is good  what do i congratulate myself for  accomplishing and what do i berate
5xbADDvciko,1292159,1298000,myself for failing to confront and to  implement
5xbADDvciko,1298000,1305919,those are all incredibly complicated  questions and you don't know the answers  to them so that's a start
5xbADDvciko,1305919,1312640,and then in terms of potential well  you'll discover a little bit more about  your potential as you discover who you
5xbADDvciko,1312640,1319600,are especially the darker parts of  yourself  because then you discover your potential  for mayhem there's some real utility in
5xbADDvciko,1319600,1325760,that  you know  discovery that you're dangerous it's  such a useful discovery
5xbADDvciko,1325760,1331520,it's actually something that strengthens  you because  the first thing that a realization like
5xbADDvciko,1331520,1336720,that can in fact produce is  the ambition to incorporate that danger
5xbADDvciko,1336720,1342799,into a higher order personality and that  can make you implacable  i can make you someone who can say no
5xbADDvciko,1342799,1348720,when you need to say no  you know that can make you someone who  won't avoid necessary conflict and so
5xbADDvciko,1348720,1355280,that's  unbelievably useful  and so that's one of the potentials that  you might discover
5xbADDvciko,1355280,1360480,the other thing you do to discover your  potential is to  well you challenge yourself
5xbADDvciko,1360480,1366640,you know it's like  take a bit of a look at yourself and  think about what's not so good that you
5xbADDvciko,1366640,1373280,could improve  that you should improve by your own  standards and that you would improve
5xbADDvciko,1373280,1378640,you know and set yourself a little goal  um you know maybe you're not studying at
5xbADDvciko,1378640,1385200,all at  your university  or maybe you're maybe you're at work and  you've got this stack of paper there you
5xbADDvciko,1385200,1390880,know and you haven't looked at that damn  stack for like a month and you know that  you should be and you're bothering
5xbADDvciko,1390880,1396159,yourself at night because you're  avoiding that it's like maybe i think  i've avoided that stack of paper
5xbADDvciko,1396159,1402880,completely for one month i'm quite a  coward when it comes to whatever snakes  might be hidden in that stack of paper
5xbADDvciko,1402880,1408400,how about tomorrow i just like put that  stack of paper in front of me on my desk  and i
5xbADDvciko,1408400,1413919,like  i glance through it for  15 seconds
5xbADDvciko,1413919,1419280,see if i can do that  it's like well  you set yourself a goal of improvement
5xbADDvciko,1419280,1424480,you know it's a humble goal  there's things you could do to improve
5xbADDvciko,1424480,1429840,and you know what they are  and there's small steps that you could  take that you might take that would put
5xbADDvciko,1429840,1436799,you in that direction and then the  question is are you big enough to take  those small steps you know are you
5xbADDvciko,1436799,1442480,capable of  grappling with the fact that you're  fundamentally flawed to the point where
5xbADDvciko,1442480,1448240,you have to break things down into  almost child-like steps in order to  manage them an answer to that is yeah
5xbADDvciko,1448240,1454640,you are  most people have things they avoid you  know and they're afraid of so i would  say to some degree it's the law of
5xbADDvciko,1454640,1459760,everyone  people vary in the degree to which  they've conquered that and you do meet
5xbADDvciko,1459760,1466880,people from time to time who are  extraordinarily disciplined but most of  the time they've got disciplined in  exactly this manner it's through slow
5xbADDvciko,1466880,1473919,incremental improvement and then you  challenge yourself it's like well could  i do this that would be better
5xbADDvciko,1473919,1479039,then you find out and then you think  well is there something slightly larger  and more challenging that i could do
5xbADDvciko,1479039,1485679,that would be better  and and you try it and you find out and  as you try it and you find out generally
5xbADDvciko,1485679,1491760,you get better at it and you can take on  larger and larger challenges  you know you take responsibility for
5xbADDvciko,1491760,1498480,yourself that's part of standing up  straight with your shoulders back it's  like  take on the world man
5xbADDvciko,1498480,1505679,but only at the level that you can  manage  when you're ignorant and biased and  deeply flawed and immature it's where
5xbADDvciko,1505679,1511039,everyone starts  you don't want to take you don't want to  bite off more than you can chew but it
5xbADDvciko,1511039,1518240,doesn't mean that you can't  wrestle with with part of reality  you know some part that's small enough
5xbADDvciko,1518240,1523760,so that you have a good shot at victory  and then you attain victory over some
5xbADDvciko,1523760,1529679,small part of the chaos and then you're  the person who's victorious over chaos
5xbADDvciko,1529679,1534799,you're just a beginner but that's who  you are and then maybe you can get
5xbADDvciko,1534799,1539919,unbelievably good at that and  you do that by challenging yourself
5xbADDvciko,1539919,1545120,humbly at the level that you're able to  function  it's easier to understand if you think
5xbADDvciko,1545120,1550720,about a child that you're trying to rear  properly and you want to
5xbADDvciko,1550720,1557679,make that child help that child reveal  their  their highest potential
5xbADDvciko,1557679,1563039,whatever that is whatever that means  and what you do is you don't set them a
5xbADDvciko,1563039,1570240,series of impossible tasks in the hope  of undermining their self-confidence you  form a relationship with them that is
5xbADDvciko,1570240,1575440,predicated on your interest in their  highest mode of being
5xbADDvciko,1575440,1582799,and then you offer them challenges that  are precisely optimized to their ability  right so they can do them but they have
5xbADDvciko,1582799,1589279,to stretch the two elements of their  ability would be what they can do and  what and how much they're capable of at
5xbADDvciko,1589279,1596080,transforming what they can do and an  optimal challenge is stretches you to  the end of what you can do and then into
5xbADDvciko,1596080,1600880,the domain of of how you can transform
5xbADDvciko,1601120,1607039,you have to be  humble and wise enough to understand  that you might have to aim pretty damn
5xbADDvciko,1607039,1613600,low especially in those places where  you're not functioning well  and it might be so embarrassing that you
5xbADDvciko,1613600,1619600,can't  that you can't bring yourself to fathom  that that's actually who you are you
5xbADDvciko,1619600,1625360,need the loss of that arrogant ego  because it's precisely what's  interfering with your movement forward
5xbADDvciko,1625360,1632559,you know it's part of the adversarial  process mythologically speaking that  stops moral progress you're too proud of
5xbADDvciko,1632559,1639200,who you think you are to notice what  you're like so that you could change  properly you don't want to sacrifice
5xbADDvciko,1639200,1646880,that part of yourself it's probably  associated with some delusion that  helps you maintain a positive although
5xbADDvciko,1646880,1654480,very fragile self-image you know in the  absence of genuine effort  it's not to be recommended
5xbADDvciko,1654480,1661039,so  you know yourself by watching and paying  attention it's not thinking
5xbADDvciko,1661039,1666880,exactly it's not imagination it's just  it's watching like you're like you're a
5xbADDvciko,1666880,1672799,snake  because a snake watches like  cold-bloodedly
5xbADDvciko,1672799,1679440,with no  emotional reaction just to see what's  there it doesn't allow
5xbADDvciko,1679440,1685919,what  is wanted or desired to interfere with  what is observed so you watch yourself
5xbADDvciko,1685919,1692320,like that as if you don't know who you  are  well that's the beginning and then you
5xbADDvciko,1692320,1698799,challenge yourself  continually  to see how far past yesterday you could
5xbADDvciko,1698799,1706399,push today and tomorrow  and to continually  experiment with expanding the domains
5xbADDvciko,1706399,1713039,not only of your competence but of your  ability to increase that competence the  upper limit to that is proportional to
5xbADDvciko,1713039,1720000,the moral effort that you put into it  the more that's guided by  the highest of all possible visions
5xbADDvciko,1720000,1726640,right the alliance with the highest of  all possible conceivable good  the more it's accompanied by truth in
5xbADDvciko,1726640,1732960,speech and action the more  you will  develop your potential and
5xbADDvciko,1732960,1739840,i believe that potential  to be as  unlimited in the upward direction more
5xbADDvciko,1739840,1745760,unlimited in the upward direction than  it is  unlimited in the direction that brings
5xbADDvciko,1745760,1751360,people to to the political and social  hells that so often characterize
5xbADDvciko,1751360,1757919,the world that we inhabit  and so  you also i suppose have to be
5xbADDvciko,1757919,1764399,willing to undertake that as an  adventure because  it's a hell of a thing to bear that kind  of responsibility
5xbADDvciko,1764399,1770240,it takes a person out of the ordinary it  takes them out of themselves
5xbADDvciko,1770240,1775279,but there's deep meaning to be had in it  and it's  and there isn't anything better that you
5xbADDvciko,1775279,1782000,can do  [Music]  there's this old idea that you go into  the abyss
5xbADDvciko,1782000,1787039,it's an idea that you can gaze into the  abyss you gaze long  and what you find in the abyss is a
5xbADDvciko,1787039,1792640,monster that's the dragon at the bottom  of the abyss let's say that's satan  himself for that matter
5xbADDvciko,1792640,1799200,but if you go into that  into that as deeply as you can what you  find is you find your fragmented
5xbADDvciko,1799200,1806399,father  in a in a comatose condition  in a desiccated and and separated
5xbADDvciko,1806399,1812559,condition  and then you revivify that well what  does that mean it means something it
5xbADDvciko,1812559,1817600,means that if you look in the darkness  you find the light that's one thing it  means and that the light really stands
5xbADDvciko,1817600,1822960,out against the darkness but that the  light is to be found in the darkness so  that's a very interesting thing that's a
5xbADDvciko,1822960,1830320,quest narrative but it means more than  that it means something fundamental so  we know for example that if you
5xbADDvciko,1830320,1837520,take yourself out of your current state  of  predictability and safety you put  yourself in a new situation you'll learn
5xbADDvciko,1837520,1842640,right  you'll incorporate new information so  that's a cognitive issue but that isn't
5xbADDvciko,1842640,1849600,all that happens what happens is that  new genes turn on within you and code  for the production of new proteins and
5xbADDvciko,1849600,1856159,that happens neurologically new parts of  you turn on  and so the idea is that if you can move
5xbADDvciko,1856159,1863440,yourself out into the world and push  yourself out against a maximum array of  challenges more and more of you turn on
5xbADDvciko,1863440,1869840,turns on and then the question would be  well what would you be  if  all of you that could be turned on was
5xbADDvciko,1869840,1875519,turned on and the answer would be you  would be the resurrection of the  ancestral father that's what you would
5xbADDvciko,1875519,1881840,be and so that's why christ says i am  the way and the truth and the life and  no one comes to the father except
5xbADDvciko,1881840,1887120,through me what that means is that if  you take on the unbearable burden of
5xbADDvciko,1887120,1893279,being voluntarily then that transforms  you into the ancestral father and that's
5xbADDvciko,1893279,1900320,true and so that's unbelievably  optimistic it's so interesting because  it's it's dark beyond belief
5xbADDvciko,1900320,1906240,well the world is characterized by  suffering and by malevolence of a depth  that's virtually beyond comprehension
5xbADDvciko,1906240,1914240,but if you choose to comprehend that  what you discover in that is the light  that destroys the darkness and that's
5xbADDvciko,1914240,1920640,well that's and that's really something  to discover it's  there isn't a discovery that's more  profound than that that's the search for
5xbADDvciko,1920640,1925518,the holy grail or the philosopher's  stone all of that
5xbADDvciko,1926080,1932000,if you actually want something  you can have it
5xbADDvciko,1932000,1939200,now the question then would be well what  do you mean by actually want  and the answer is that you reorient your
5xbADDvciko,1939200,1944799,life  in every possible way  to make the probability that that will
5xbADDvciko,1944799,1951760,occur as certain as possible and that's  a sacrificial idea right it's like you  don't get everything
5xbADDvciko,1951760,1956799,obviously you  obviously  but maybe you can have what you need
5xbADDvciko,1956799,1962799,and maybe all you have to do to get it  is ask  but asking isn't
5xbADDvciko,1962799,1968159,a whim or or today's wish  it's like you have to be deadly serious
5xbADDvciko,1968159,1974320,about it you have to think okay like i'm  taking stock of myself and if i was  going to live properly in the world and
5xbADDvciko,1974320,1980159,i was going to  set myself up  such that being would justify itself in
5xbADDvciko,1980159,1986720,my estimation and i don't mean as a  harsh judge exactly what is it that i  would aim at
5xbADDvciko,1986720,1991840,you could try this  this is a form of prayer  knocking
5xbADDvciko,1991840,1996960,sit on your bed one day and ask yourself  what remarkably stupid things am i doing
5xbADDvciko,1996960,2002720,on a regular basis to absolutely screw  up my life  and if you actually ask that question
5xbADDvciko,2002720,2008960,but you have to want to know the answer  right because that's actually what  asking the question means it doesn't  mean just mouthing the words it means
5xbADDvciko,2008960,2014210,you have to decide that you want to know  you'll figure that's out so fast it'll  make your hair curl
5xbADDvciko,2014210,2020559,[Music]  you're perfectly capable of thinking god  only knows how you're perfectly capable
5xbADDvciko,2020559,2026159,of of immense feats of imagination and  and dream and fantasies god only knows
5xbADDvciko,2026159,2031600,how you do all of that what would happen  if you consulted yourself about the best  possible outcome for you
5xbADDvciko,2031600,2037440,you might get an answer  in order for us to set things right we
5xbADDvciko,2037440,2044080,have to understand that we we have to  take on that burden of ultimate  responsibility not only as if it's ours
5xbADDvciko,2044080,2051118,which it is but as if there isn't  anything better that we could do and  you have an ethical obligation to lift
5xbADDvciko,2051118,2056720,the heaviest load you can possibly  conceive of  and
5xbADDvciko,2056720,2062398,that's the primary call to adventure in  life  you need a meaning in your life to
5xbADDvciko,2062398,2068079,forestall the suffering and to make you  strong enough to resist malevolence  where's the meaning to be found
5xbADDvciko,2068079,2074560,rights impulsive pleasure and happiness  no  responsibility oh who would have guessed
5xbADDvciko,2074560,2080480,that  it's not part of the narrative  what makes life worth living is to pick
5xbADDvciko,2080480,2086960,up  take its catastrophe and embrace it and  carry it and to
5xbADDvciko,2086960,2091520,realize through that process who you are
5xbADDvciko,2092079,2098880,when i talk to audiences about the  relationship between responsibility and  meaning they inevitably go dead silent
5xbADDvciko,2098880,2104320,there's not a there's not a rustle  there's not a cough it's like  is that the secret is that the secret is
5xbADDvciko,2104320,2110640,that it's the voluntary adoption of  responsibility it's like well that's the  that's the central message of the west
5xbADDvciko,2110640,2117359,it's like to pick up your cross and bear  it you know and everyone's been told  that but they don't know what it means
5xbADDvciko,2117359,2124400,because it's not been articulated enough  so that it becomes something that's  practical it's like yes look at the  terrible responsibilities you have right
5xbADDvciko,2124400,2130560,in front of you  your family is hurting you're in trouble  there's problems in the world it's like
5xbADDvciko,2130560,2137760,all of that's right there and all you  have to do is  all you have to do is take  responsibility for it and then you've
5xbADDvciko,2137760,2143200,got what you need  it's something so magnificent that
5xbADDvciko,2143200,2149520,happiness pales in comparison  so it's it's it's thin gruel happiness
5xbADDvciko,2149520,2155680,and young people know that they're  pursuing hedonistic pleasure and you  know no wonder but there's nothing in it
5xbADDvciko,2155680,2162400,that's sustaining and all it does is  make you cynical it's like is that's all  there is another one night stand another
5xbADDvciko,2162400,2169119,another binge party you know and it's  not like i have anything against  in principle against some of that
5xbADDvciko,2169119,2175359,exuberant  youthful hedonism  look the universities have turned into
5xbADDvciko,2175359,2181440,places of parties  why well because that's what the  students find best to do there well
5xbADDvciko,2181440,2187440,that's not good what you want to offer  them is a reason to not  party it's like no you've got to
5xbADDvciko,2187440,2192800,understand you come to this class hung  over you're not going to be able to get  it you're not going to be able to write
5xbADDvciko,2192800,2198800,properly you're going to pay a price for  that hedonism it's like and the price  will be too high for you to bear it's
5xbADDvciko,2198800,2204530,like oh well enough hedonism for me then  like i've got something important to do  that's the way out of that
5xbADDvciko,2204530,2211760,[Music]  before you can be a painter who can  paint what's beyond mere memory
5xbADDvciko,2211760,2219920,you you have to inculcate that  discipline skill and a lot of that is  painful repetition and hard grinding
5xbADDvciko,2219920,2226480,work it's the sacrifice of the present  for the future but once you manage that  then things open up
5xbADDvciko,2226480,2233440,that's why we have disciplines right i  mean the words aren't there by accident  you have to narrow yourself first and
5xbADDvciko,2233440,2239040,then you can broaden outward and so  that's and that's part of the process of  maturation
5xbADDvciko,2239040,2245920,that's part of the sacrifice of  childhood say  in childhood you're nothing but  potential but it's not realized and you
5xbADDvciko,2245920,2251119,don't know how to realize it and so then  the question is well how do you get to a  point where you realize the potential
5xbADDvciko,2251119,2256960,and the answer is you sacrifice almost  all of it to a single direction and so
5xbADDvciko,2256960,2263040,that's the thing about growing up is  that when you're a teenager and a young  adult you have to sacrifice everything
5xbADDvciko,2263040,2270720,you could have been as a child to be the  one thing that you're aiming at but then  that opens up
5xbADDvciko,2270720,2275760,everyone in their right mind knows that  there's a million ways of doing things  wrong and one way if you're lucky to do
5xbADDvciko,2275760,2280880,things right and so the notion that it's  a very very narrow pathway that you
5xbADDvciko,2280880,2286880,tread upon if you're doing things right  that's wisdom that's the line between  chaos and order that you're supposed to
5xbADDvciko,2286880,2292560,be on constantly right it's a very very  thin line because if you're a little bit  too far in one direction then it's too
5xbADDvciko,2292560,2299119,much chaos and if you're a little too  far in the other direction then it's too  much order and both of those aren't good  it has to the balance has to be exactly
5xbADDvciko,2299119,2305119,right and you can feel that and i truly  believe you can feel that and i think  it's your deepest instinct it's your
5xbADDvciko,2305119,2311359,deepest instinct and i mean that i mean  that biologically i don't mean that  metaphorically i think that your psyche
5xbADDvciko,2311359,2317599,is arranged to exist in a cosmos that's  composed of  chaos and order i think that's why you
5xbADDvciko,2317599,2322960,have the hemispheric structure that you  have and then  when you feel as if you're meaningfully
5xbADDvciko,2322960,2330000,engaged in the world  when the terror of your mortality strips  away and you're engaged and it's
5xbADDvciko,2330000,2335760,timeless  that's the deepest instinct you have  telling you that you're in the right
5xbADDvciko,2335760,2341599,place at the right time  and then what you do is practice being  there practice being there and that's
5xbADDvciko,2341599,2347280,that that narrow spot that's so  difficult to find you wander around it  maybe if you're lucky you can watch you
5xbADDvciko,2347280,2352400,can watch this is an experiment watch  yourself for two weeks  like you don't know who you are because
5xbADDvciko,2352400,2357680,you don't so watch yourself for two  weeks and notice there's going to be  times when things are proper they're
5xbADDvciko,2357680,2364400,raid properly for you  it's not easy to notice because when  they're arrayed like that you're so  engaged you don't exactly notice you
5xbADDvciko,2364400,2369440,know but you'll see oh i'm in the right  place it's like okay how'd i get here
5xbADDvciko,2369440,2375520,what am i doing right  you know how is it that this could  happen more often i'd like this to  happen more often how would i have to
5xbADDvciko,2375520,2380960,conduct myself in order for that to  happen more often and then you practice  that and then maybe instead of 10
5xbADDvciko,2380960,2386480,minutes a month or 10 minutes a week  it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's  half an hour a day and then it's an hour
5xbADDvciko,2386480,2392240,a day and then it's four hours a day and  maybe if you if you're extraordinarily  careful then you get to a point where
5xbADDvciko,2392240,2400000,you're like that  a good proportion of the time  [Music]
5xbADDvciko,2400000,2406720,you are not the master of your own house  there are spirits that dwell within you  meaning
5xbADDvciko,2406720,2412960,you have a will and you can exercise  a certain amount of conscious control  over your being but there are all sorts
5xbADDvciko,2412960,2418880,of things that occur within you that  seem to be beyond your capacity to  control your dreams for example that's a
5xbADDvciko,2418880,2425280,really good example are your impulses  for example you might think of those as  so foreign from you that they're not  even you don't even want them to be part
5xbADDvciko,2425280,2431920,of you but but more subtly even how  about what you're interested in what  compels you like where does that come
5xbADDvciko,2431920,2438240,from  exactly  because you can't conjure it up of your  own accord you know so if you're a
5xbADDvciko,2438240,2443520,student and you're taking difficult  course you might say to yourself well i  need to sit down and study for three
5xbADDvciko,2443520,2449680,hours but then you sit down and that is  what happens your attention goes  everywhere and you might say well
5xbADDvciko,2449680,2454720,whose attention is it then if it goes  everywhere because you say it's your  attention it's like well
5xbADDvciko,2454720,2460160,if it's your attention maybe you would  be able to control it but you can't and  so then you might think well jen just
5xbADDvciko,2460160,2466319,exactly what the hell is controlling it  and you might say well it's random it's  well it better not be random i can tell
5xbADDvciko,2466319,2471680,you that that's that happens to some  degree in schizophrenia there's an  element of randomness in that it's not
5xbADDvciko,2471680,2477520,random  it's driven by the action of  phenomena that i think are best
5xbADDvciko,2477520,2483760,considered as something like sub  personality you can't make yourself  interested in something
5xbADDvciko,2483760,2490240,interest  manifests itself and grips you  that's a whole different thing
5xbADDvciko,2490240,2496000,and so what is it that's gripping you  and how do you conceptualize that is  that a divine power well it's divine as
5xbADDvciko,2496000,2502720,far as you're concerned because it grips  you and you can't do anything about it  and so there's a calling in you towards
5xbADDvciko,2502720,2509359,what you're compelled by and what you're  interested in and sometimes that might  be very dark  and sometimes not but you're compelled
5xbADDvciko,2509359,2515440,forward by your interest  and so the idea that what moves you away  from your country and your father's
5xbADDvciko,2515440,2521599,house and the comforts of your child at  home is is something that's beyond you  and that you listen to and hearken to
5xbADDvciko,2521599,2527920,that's exactly right and you can say  well i don't want to call that god it's  like  it doesn't matter what you call it
5xbADDvciko,2527920,2533520,exactly  it doesn't matter to what it is what  it's called
5xbADDvciko,2533520,2538560,it still is  and if you don't listen to it that's the  other thing if you don't listen to it
5xbADDvciko,2538560,2545040,and i've been a clinician and talked to  enough people now as old as i am to know  this absolutely if you do not listen to
5xbADDvciko,2545040,2551440,that thing that beckons you forward you  will pay for it like you cannot possibly  imagine you'll have everything that's
5xbADDvciko,2551440,2557440,terrible about life  in your life and nothing about it that's  good and worse you'll know
5xbADDvciko,2557440,2564000,that it was your fault and that you  squandered what you could have had  so
5xbADDvciko,2564000,2570160,this is not only a calling forth but a  warning  [Music]  one of the things that i've noticed in
5xbADDvciko,2570160,2577119,my life is that  nothing i've ever done was wasted  and by done i mean put my heart and soul
5xbADDvciko,2577119,2582319,into you know like  like  attempted with with all of my effort
5xbADDvciko,2582319,2588000,that that always worked now it didn't  always work the way i expected it to  work that's a whole different issue but
5xbADDvciko,2588000,2594640,the payoff from it was always positive  something of value always accrued to me  when i made the sacrifices necessary to
5xbADDvciko,2594640,2600240,do something worthwhile  go somewhere you don't understand you
5xbADDvciko,2600240,2606960,have to go into the unknown and that's  that's god's first command go into the  unknown because you already know what
5xbADDvciko,2606960,2612960,you know  and so and that's not enough unless you  think you're enough and if you're not  enough and you don't think you're enough
5xbADDvciko,2612960,2618880,then you have to go where you haven't  been get away from your family enough so  that you can establish your independence
5xbADDvciko,2618880,2625119,and that isn't because there's something  wrong with your family but it means  get away you know i talk to people very
5xbADDvciko,2625119,2631359,frequently whose families have provided  them with too much protection and they  know it themselves and that means
5xbADDvciko,2631359,2637280,they're deprived of necessity then you  have to get yourself away from your  dependency in order to
5xbADDvciko,2637280,2642800,allow  necessity to drive you forward  and that's to become independent and to
5xbADDvciko,2642800,2649520,become mature  you know we've been fed this unending  diet of rights and freedoms and there's
5xbADDvciko,2649520,2655040,something about that there's something  about that that's so pathologically  wrong and people are starving for the
5xbADDvciko,2655040,2661680,antidote and the antidote is  truth and responsibility right and it  isn't it isn't because that's what you
5xbADDvciko,2661680,2666880,should do and some some i know better or  someone knows better for you what you
5xbADDvciko,2666880,2672319,should do since it's that that's the  secret to a meaningful life and without  the meaningful life then all you have is
5xbADDvciko,2672319,2680000,suffering and and nihilism and despair  and all of that and self-contempt and  that's not good and it's necessary for
5xbADDvciko,2680000,2686000,men to stand up and take responsibility  if you were able to reveal the best of
5xbADDvciko,2686000,2691200,yourself to you in the world that you  would be an overwhelming force for good
5xbADDvciko,2691200,2696319,and that whatever errors might be made  along the way would wash out in the  works
5xbADDvciko,2696319,2702160,if you  forthrightly pursue  that which god directs you to pursue
5xbADDvciko,2702160,2707280,let's say that all things are possible  and so we don't know the limits of human
5xbADDvciko,2707280,2712640,endeavor we truly don't  and it it's it's premature to put a cap
5xbADDvciko,2712640,2718000,on what it is that we are what it is  that we're capable of and so you know  you're already something and maybe
5xbADDvciko,2718000,2724000,you're not so bad in your current  configuration but you might wonder if  you did nothing for the next 30 years
5xbADDvciko,2724000,2729839,except put yourself together just  exactly what would you be able to do  and you might think well that's worth
5xbADDvciko,2729839,2734960,finding out but of course that's that's  the adoption of responsibility  [Music]
5xbADDvciko,2734960,2742079,there's lots in the world to fix  everything that bothers you about the  world  and about yourself should be fixed and
5xbADDvciko,2742079,2747280,you can do that  i have a friend  he lives in montreal his name is james
5xbADDvciko,2747280,2752880,simon he's a great painter and he's  taught me a lot of things help he's  helped me design my house and beautify
5xbADDvciko,2752880,2759200,it and i bought some paintings from him  a couple of years ago  and he did this series of paintings
5xbADDvciko,2759200,2766800,where he went around north america and  and stood in different places and then  he painted the view from here down and
5xbADDvciko,2766800,2773440,so it's his feet planted in different  places on roads in the desert on the  ocean yeah well you know he was trying
5xbADDvciko,2773440,2779280,to make a point and the point was that  wherever you are it's worth paying  attention and that's because you know so
5xbADDvciko,2779280,2785280,all these places that he visited he  looked exactly where he was standing by  the side of the road in the desert
5xbADDvciko,2785280,2791520,sounded mundane in some sense but then  maybe he put 40 hours into that painting  you know it's very very realistic
5xbADDvciko,2791520,2797839,painting with really good light and what  he's telling you as a painter is  everything is worth paying attention to
5xbADDvciko,2797839,2803440,an infinite amount but you don't have  enough time so the artist does that for  you right the artist looks and looks and
5xbADDvciko,2803440,2809040,looks and looks and looks and then gives  you that vision and so then you can look  at the painting and it reminds you that
5xbADDvciko,2809040,2815520,everything that there is is right where  you are and that's a hard thing to  realize but it's actually true and so
5xbADDvciko,2815520,2821599,i've i've been telling people online in  various ways and in lectures that they  should start fixing up the world by
5xbADDvciko,2821599,2828160,cleaning up their room  how you would like your life to be what  you would like your character to be
5xbADDvciko,2828160,2834880,three to five years down the road if you  were taking care of yourself like you  were taking care of someone that you  actually cared about so you kind of have
5xbADDvciko,2834880,2840480,to split yourself into two people and  treat yourself like you like someone you  have respect for and that you want the
5xbADDvciko,2840480,2845520,best for that's not easy because people  don't necessarily have respect for  themselves and they don't necessarily
5xbADDvciko,2845520,2851839,want what's the best for themselves  because they they have a lot of  self-contempt and a lot of self-hatred a  lot of guilt i think you have an
5xbADDvciko,2851839,2858640,obligation it's one of the highest moral  obligations to treat yourself as if  you're a creature of value how you would
5xbADDvciko,2858640,2865680,like your friendships to be conducted  because it's useful to surround yourself  with people who are trying to move  forward and and more importantly who are
5xbADDvciko,2865680,2870800,happy when you move forward and not  happy when you move backwards not when  you fall that isn't what i mean but when
5xbADDvciko,2870800,2876240,you're doing self-destructive things  your friends shouldn't be there to cheer  you on
5xbADDvciko,2876240,2881680,you look at the world through a story  you can't you can't help it and this in  the story is what gives value to the
5xbADDvciko,2881680,2887359,world or or the stories what you extract  from the value of the world you can look  at it either way
5xbADDvciko,2887359,2892640,here somewhere and it's not good enough  right that's the eternal human  predicament wherever you are isn't good
5xbADDvciko,2892640,2898640,enough and to some degree that's  actually a good thing because if it was  good enough well  there's nothing for you to do
5xbADDvciko,2898640,2903680,so it's actually maybe a good thing that  it's insufficient  and that might be why sometimes having
5xbADDvciko,2903680,2909200,less is  is better than having more and i don't  want to be a pollyanna about that i mean
5xbADDvciko,2909200,2916319,i know that there's  deprivation that can reach to the point  where it's where it's completely  counterproductive but it isn't always
5xbADDvciko,2916319,2921760,the case that starting with little is  you if you start with little you start
5xbADDvciko,2921760,2927760,with more possibility it's something  like that so you move from always from  what's unbearable about the present to
5xbADDvciko,2927760,2933119,some better future  right and if you don't have that then  you have nothing but threat and a
5xbADDvciko,2933119,2938720,negative emotion you have no positive  emotion because the positive emotion is  generated in the conception of the
5xbADDvciko,2938720,2944160,better future and then the  evidence that you generate yourself that  you're moving towards it that's where
5xbADDvciko,2944160,2951200,the positive and fulfilling meaning of  life comes so you want to set up this  structure properly it's very very  important and so what it means is that
5xbADDvciko,2951200,2958319,you want to be going somewhere  that's good enough so that the going is  worth the while and you can ask yourself
5xbADDvciko,2958319,2964800,that and well we know what's wrong with  life it's rife with suffering and  insufficiency and deception and evil
5xbADDvciko,2964800,2970160,it's all of that obviously okay what  would make the journey worthwhile
5xbADDvciko,2970160,2976640,or you can ask yourself that it's like  all right in order to bear up under this  load what is it that i would need to be
5xbADDvciko,2976640,2982800,striving to attain and if you ask  yourself that that's to knock and and  the door will open that's what that
5xbADDvciko,2982800,2988240,means if you ask yourself that then you  will find an answer and you'll think  you'll shrink away from it you'll think
5xbADDvciko,2988240,2993280,well there's no way i could do that it's  like well  you don't know what you could do
5xbADDvciko,2993280,2999920,you don't know what's possible  and you're not as much as you could be  and so god only knows what you could
5xbADDvciko,2999920,3005599,what you could do and have and give if  you sacrificed everything to it
5xbADDvciko,3005599,3013200,you have to sacrifice that which is most  valuable to you currently that's  stopping you and god only knows what
5xbADDvciko,3013200,3019599,that is it's certainly the worst of you  it's certainly that and god only knows  to what degree you're in love with the
5xbADDvciko,3019599,3025040,worst of you  [Music]  resentment is a key human motivation and
5xbADDvciko,3025040,3031520,i would say it's a great teacher to  listen to your resentment is one of the  best things you can possibly do
5xbADDvciko,3031520,3038559,resentment  only means one of two things it means  either like shut the hell up grow up  quit whining and get on with it that's
5xbADDvciko,3038559,3045119,one thing it means or  someone is playing the tyrant to you  might even be you you have something to
5xbADDvciko,3045119,3051280,say and do that you should say and do to  put it to a stop  and so maybe resentment can show you the
5xbADDvciko,3051280,3057440,pathway to doing that like a resentful  person wants other people to change  and if you're resentful then your
5xbADDvciko,3057440,3062480,motivations aren't trustworthy in fact  they're very very dark and  what should you do instead how do you
5xbADDvciko,3062480,3069280,treat your own resentment i would say  well  solzhenitsyn who i'm a great i'm a great  admirer of solzhenitsyn his book the
5xbADDvciko,3069280,3074640,gulag archipelago was one of the things  that brought down the soviet union and  he said that one man who stopped lying
5xbADDvciko,3074640,3081119,could bring down a tyranny and you know  he said that with some authority and he  said when he was in the gulag camps you
5xbADDvciko,3081119,3087040,know meditating on how the hell he got  there and he had a rough life man i mean  first of all he was on the russian front
5xbADDvciko,3087040,3093680,at the beginning of world war ii and  then he was thrown in the gulag camps  and that was just the beginning of his  adventures man he had a rough life he
5xbADDvciko,3093680,3100800,was in the camps he was thinking what  the hell how did i get here what's going  on and he had hitler and stalin to blame
5xbADDvciko,3100800,3107200,right so if you have if you need someone  to blame man hitler and stellan that  that's great but he that isn't what he
5xbADDvciko,3107200,3113839,did he said he meditated for a while  once he realized that he might have  something to do with  in some strange way with the way things
5xbADDvciko,3113839,3120079,turned out for him and he said he went  over his life with a fine-tooth comb in  his memory he thought okay
5xbADDvciko,3120079,3126880,where did i go wrong but by my own  judgment when there was a path in front  of me  when did i take the path that i knew i
5xbADDvciko,3126880,3133839,shouldn't take because you all know that  right you know  sometimes you don't know if what you're  doing is good or if it's bad
5xbADDvciko,3133839,3140640,it's just ignorance you just don't know  but sometimes you bloody well know and  you do the thing you know you shouldn't  do anyways that happens a lot
5xbADDvciko,3140640,3146000,and  why do you do that spite is part of it  stupidity there's all sorts of reasons
5xbADDvciko,3146000,3151200,but you certainly know you do it  solzhenitsyn thought okay well what  would happen if i took responsibility
5xbADDvciko,3151200,3157119,for where i am in this concentration  camp and then i went over my whole life  and tried to figure out all the things i
5xbADDvciko,3157119,3162640,did that were wrong by my own estimation  that increased the probability that i  would get here and then what would
5xbADDvciko,3162640,3168640,happen if i tried to set them all right  now in the present and that's why he  wrote the guru like archipelago and one
5xbADDvciko,3168640,3175520,of the consequences of that as i said  was  it sped the dissolution of the soviet  empire so hey that's not bad eh like you
5xbADDvciko,3175520,3182640,make a real confession you really repent  you do your penance which is writing  this book and you completely change the
5xbADDvciko,3182640,3189040,geopolitical landscape of the world it's  like and that that's worth thinking  about because it's not only solzhenitsyn
5xbADDvciko,3189040,3194480,who did that nelson mandela did  something quite similar it's not so  impossible and so
5xbADDvciko,3194480,3199920,the idea that  what you should do if you're feeling  resentful about the nature of being or
5xbADDvciko,3199920,3205680,suffering too much for your own life  let's say is straighten the damn thing  out like seriously try it for a year
5xbADDvciko,3205680,3211440,even try it for a week  try  not doing the things you know you  shouldn't do
5xbADDvciko,3211440,3217680,try  not saying the things you know to be  false  and just watch what happens you might as
5xbADDvciko,3217680,3223680,well give it a shot right because you  say well i'm all in for a year you know  i'm going to do things right
5xbADDvciko,3223680,3230559,and then i'll just stand back and kind  of watch how things unfold and maybe  i'll reconsider at the end of that year
5xbADDvciko,3230559,3236720,it's like try it  try it  i mean i would say i've had thousands of
5xbADDvciko,3236720,3242720,letters now from people who are saying  hey i tried that you know and  hey you know
5xbADDvciko,3242720,3250240,worked  i read this great line in the t.s eliot  play called the cocktail party and in it
5xbADDvciko,3250240,3257119,this woman comes up to a psychiatrist  and she says you know i'm having a  really rough time of it i'm suffering  badly my life is not going well and then
5xbADDvciko,3257119,3262640,she says uh i hope that there's  something wrong with me  and the psychiatrist says what the hell
5xbADDvciko,3262640,3268640,do you mean by that and she says well  here's how i look at it there's either  something wrong with the world and
5xbADDvciko,3268640,3274319,i'm just in it and that's how it is and  then like what am i going to do about  that because it's the whole world or
5xbADDvciko,3274319,3279920,maybe i could be fortunate and there's  something wrong with me that's causing  all this unnecessary suffering and if i
5xbADDvciko,3279920,3286000,would i could just set it right i could  learn and i could set it right  and so
5xbADDvciko,3286000,3291040,well i've been thinking about that for a  very long time and i think well if your  life isn't going the way it is you know
5xbADDvciko,3291040,3299359,you can find someone else to blame which  is pretty convenient for you and also  relatively easy or you could think okay
5xbADDvciko,3299359,3304480,i don't like  life i don't like the way my life is  unfolding
5xbADDvciko,3304480,3310160,maybe i don't like life in general  because it's tragic and and tainted with  evil
5xbADDvciko,3310160,3316720,how do i know if my judgment is accurate  and the question is well have i really  done everything i possibly could to set
5xbADDvciko,3316720,3322480,my life straight  because maybe i shouldn't be judging it  it's quality or the quality of life
5xbADDvciko,3322480,3330400,itself or being itself for that matter  if i haven't done everything i possibly  could to set my life straight
5xbADDvciko,3330400,3335920,well so there's a there's a task  humility element is it took me a long
5xbADDvciko,3335920,3341040,time to understand why there's religious  injunctions  supporting humility
5xbADDvciko,3341040,3346799,to even understand what the word really  meant in that sort of technical sense  and it means something like this it  means what you don't know is more
5xbADDvciko,3346799,3351920,important than what you know  then then what you don't know can start  to be your friend you see people are
5xbADDvciko,3351920,3357920,very defensive about what they know  but the thing is  you don't know enough and the re you can
5xbADDvciko,3357920,3363599,tell you don't know enough because your  life is not what it could be and neither  is the life of the people around you you
5xbADDvciko,3363599,3369280,just don't know enough  and so  what that means is that every time you  encounter
5xbADDvciko,3369280,3377119,some evidence that you're ignorant  someone points it out you should be  happy about that because you think oh  you just told me how i'm wrong it's like
5xbADDvciko,3377119,3383040,great like maybe i had to sift through a  lot of nonsense to get through the real  message that you're telling me but if
5xbADDvciko,3383040,3388319,you could actually tell me some way that  i'm wrong and then maybe give me a hint  about how to not be wrong like that well
5xbADDvciko,3388319,3394240,then i wouldn't have to be wrong like  that anymore that that would be a good  thing  you can embark on that adventure by
5xbADDvciko,3394240,3400079,listening to people and if you listen to  people they will tell you  they'll tell you amazing things if you
5xbADDvciko,3400079,3406799,listen to them and many of those things  are little tools that you can put in  your toolkit like batman and then you  can go out into the world and use those
5xbADDvciko,3406799,3413440,tools and you don't have to fall blindly  into a pit quite as often and so the  humility element is well
5xbADDvciko,3413440,3419119,do you want to be right  or do you want to be learning  and then it's deeper than that it's do
5xbADDvciko,3419119,3425680,you want to be the the tyrannical king  who's already got everything figured out  or do you want to be the continually
5xbADDvciko,3425680,3430880,transforming hero or fool for that  matter who's getting better all the time
5xbADDvciko,3430880,3436720,and that's actually a choice you know um  it's a deep choice and it's better to be
5xbADDvciko,3436720,3443200,the self-transforming fool who's  humble enough to make friends with what  he or she doesn't know and to listen
5xbADDvciko,3443200,3448960,when people talk and  listening is a transformative exercise  like if if you listen to the people in
5xbADDvciko,3448960,3456000,your life for example if you actually  listen to them they'll tell you what's  wrong with them and how to fix it and  what they want they can't even help it
5xbADDvciko,3456000,3462000,if you start listening because people  are so shocked if you actually listen to  them that  they tell you all sorts of things that
5xbADDvciko,3462000,3468319,they might not have even intended to  things they don't even know  and then you can  you can work with that and the other
5xbADDvciko,3468319,3474319,thing that's so interesting you know now  and then you have a meaningful  conversation right you have a good  conversation with somebody you walk when
5xbADDvciko,3474319,3479920,you think geez you know we really  connected and i know more than i did  when i came away from that conversation
5xbADDvciko,3479920,3485520,and during the conversation you're  really engrossed in it  and that feeling of being engrossed is a
5xbADDvciko,3485520,3490880,feeling of meaning and the feeling of  meaning is engendered because you're  having a transformative conversation
5xbADDvciko,3490880,3497520,your brain produces that feeling of  meaning for it says oh yeah  this is exactly where you should be  right here and now it's it's the right
5xbADDvciko,3497520,3504480,place and time for you and that's a  great place to occupy and so a good  conversation where people are listening
5xbADDvciko,3504480,3509599,has exactly that nature and the reason  it has that nature is because it is in  fact transformative it's one of the
5xbADDvciko,3509599,3515920,truisms of clinical psychology like if  you're a clinical psychologist a huge  part of what you do is just listen to
5xbADDvciko,3515920,3522559,people  it's like you know  they come in they're unhappy and they'd  rather not be something like that you
5xbADDvciko,3522559,3527599,say well  why do you think you might be unhappy  and they don't know they have some ideas
5xbADDvciko,3527599,3532880,they may have to ramble around for like  a year before they figure out why  they're unhappy they get rid of a bunch
5xbADDvciko,3532880,3539200,of reasons  why they thought they were unhappy that  are untrue and then you kind of get to  the heart of the problem then you might
5xbADDvciko,3539200,3544559,ask them well  if you could have what you wanted so  that your life would be okay what would
5xbADDvciko,3544559,3549680,that look like then they have to ramble  around a bunch about that because they  don't really know but
5xbADDvciko,3549680,3555760,the listening will straighten them out  because people think by talking and in  order to think you have to have someone
5xbADDvciko,3555760,3561599,to listen because it's very hard to  think hardly anyone can think and even  the people who can think can only think
5xbADDvciko,3561599,3567440,about a limited number of things but  almost everybody can talk and you can  listen to yourself talk and if someone
5xbADDvciko,3567440,3573200,listens to you then well then  you also have a foil for your thoughts  right because you can watch the person
5xbADDvciko,3573200,3579760,when you're talking and see if you're  boring or see if you're amusing or if  you're engrossing all of those things
5xbADDvciko,3579760,3585119,so like if you're arguing with your wife  let's say or your husband  big party is going to want to win
5xbADDvciko,3585119,3591680,that's stupid because because you don't  want that you want to you want to defeat  your wife in an argument oh well great
5xbADDvciko,3591680,3597920,like if she was going to disappear  tomorrow no problem but like you're  going to like live with defeated
5xbADDvciko,3597920,3604559,miserable her for the next week that's  no good so you listen and you think okay  well here's here's what you what i think
5xbADDvciko,3604559,3610799,you said and maybe even make it a little  stronger and more elaborated than was  the case with the original utterance so
5xbADDvciko,3610799,3618160,that you get the damn argument right  because you don't want to win you want  to fix the problem that's the winning
5xbADDvciko,3618160,3633679,[Music]
5xbADDvciko,3642960,3645040,you
