1GcLU9rSyag,385919,392400,west coast east coast  and when you know 50 how he entered and  then he brought you along
1GcLU9rSyag,392400,398960,that was that that was a special time in  hip-hop you know what i'm saying so  i i understand the situation but i
1GcLU9rSyag,398960,405360,definitely want to give both of y'all  y'all flowers  and everybody involved because that was  a legendary run that i don't know if we
1GcLU9rSyag,405360,408080,ever see again
1GcLU9rSyag,415520,420639,you know the story is that 50 came in  and like wrote the documentary like well
1GcLU9rSyag,420639,426560,we know that's not true because i have  more classic albums than him and then  but what he did
1GcLU9rSyag,426560,432400,help himself well it's not petty it's it  how can he be petty if it's a fact right  because you know that's just
1GcLU9rSyag,432400,438240,like like 50 had a 50 had get  richard.tron we all know that the album  like the magnitude of the album was dope
1GcLU9rSyag,438240,444400,at that time in hip-hop and he was a  force and then he had uh i think the  second one was like the massacre or
1GcLU9rSyag,444400,451919,something like that and that was a  pretty that was a pretty decent album  but really like really on some real  hip-hop 50 have one classic album like
1GcLU9rSyag,451919,458000,one get richard.trying and amazing me  i've had several like several and i'm  still here right now putting out an
1GcLU9rSyag,458000,465520,album in what three weeks  so  dralmatic and so  um 50 had his time in rap and then he
1GcLU9rSyag,465520,472000,did what a real should do in transition  when it was over for him he went to tv  and looked like it's amazing he got a
1GcLU9rSyag,472000,479840,star on hollywood you know what i'm  saying people walk on it and step on it  every day and you know like that's all  cool i watch bmf i like power um the

1GcLU9rSyag,499599,506879,tremendously and then like you said like  it was a thing gaming 50 was like a  super huge thing but as far as like my
1GcLU9rSyag,506879,514159,my skill set and what i'm able to do  lyrically like no better than that so  like just cut all the 50 wrote for game
1GcLU9rSyag,514159,520719,50 wrote for 50 and did his part and  then you you got to know when you were a  group and you're in a studio and you're
1GcLU9rSyag,520719,527440,writing you know what i'm saying it's  like it's like you when you when you  catch an interception right you turn the  [ __ ] around and you go score
1GcLU9rSyag,527440,532640,that's a personal accolade for you for  you but you're really doing it for the  team the team wins so when we in there
1GcLU9rSyag,532640,538000,and i'm bouncing my lyrics off of you  and and we all in the huddle and i'd be  like yo swaggy what you think about if i

1GcLU9rSyag,599440,605360,literally wouldn't come out and wanted  him to come out but had it surrounded  and jamie foxx was there and blah blah
1GcLU9rSyag,605360,611519,blah and you know like he was going  around he ran up on baby and wayne in a  in a car in l.a and tried to punch
1GcLU9rSyag,611519,617360,and he ran up on the car like get out  the car talking to wayne  and it was all happening on you know la
1GcLU9rSyag,617360,623040,la soil so um what what happened was  i got i kind of got into it because
1GcLU9rSyag,623040,630880,wayne and i'm from l.a and i feel like  like nah you can't play [ __ ] in la  like that right um so i got into it but
1GcLU9rSyag,630880,636240,the name for the glock to me in my mind  and my heart was like damn like i when i
1GcLU9rSyag,636240,642720,see this it's it's gonna be up because  this will be doing is in so the name
1GcLU9rSyag,642720,647839,you know it was like his name was in  lights out here on some you know like  40 glock right
1GcLU9rSyag,647839,653920,so when i saw it  in real life my heart was beating but i  had already talked my he already talked
1GcLU9rSyag,653920,660079,it  but he was over there he seen me i seen  him  and i i pumped myself up like kind of if
1GcLU9rSyag,660079,665440,you know if i was about to face like  demarco  so i'm rocking i'm like  i'm like
1GcLU9rSyag,665440,671120,what happened  ain't no ain't no i couldn't go  backwards right
1GcLU9rSyag,671120,677360,you see me i see him so i said you know  what [ __ ] [ __ ] we about to go over  here get ourselves let's go
1GcLU9rSyag,677360,684240,so cause it's 40 god right  right  look at 20 glock yo so and then this  spot jamie foxx told me a story to have
1GcLU9rSyag,684240,690240,me like damn  so i'm like  so i go over there i start approaching
1GcLU9rSyag,690240,696160,me  he started walking away yeah i said oh  what's up so you know my [ __ ] like i got
1GcLU9rSyag,696160,701680,it so this [ __ ] started walking down  the driveway and it was like a driveway  that went like this and had high trees
1GcLU9rSyag,701680,706959,so he was going that way he couldn't see  that i was on this way i mean going this  way so when we got to the end of the
1GcLU9rSyag,706959,712079,driveway and we met i was like now i'm  amped up because he didn't he tried to  make an exit so i'm like what's
1GcLU9rSyag,712079,717839,happening blood and [ __ ] took off  running homie so again we all know what  happens
1GcLU9rSyag,717839,724000,going back  looking for the glock  looking for the glock i took the camera  before the glock you know the reason i
1GcLU9rSyag,724000,729160,took the camera out is because he liked  to take the camera you like to pull the  camera out and like
1GcLU9rSyag,729160,735360,[Music]  my shoes and everything but anyway  that's back then so the point i'm trying  to make is that
1GcLU9rSyag,735360,742160,names so when you when you coming up to  the line of scrimmage right and you see  a pack when you see pac-man jones and
1GcLU9rSyag,742160,747440,you it's like pac-man like like pac-man  that's a dope right right here
1GcLU9rSyag,747440,753279,i have some  who wasn't even like in football like  that they're always like oh i want  pac-man his name's pac-man like my
1GcLU9rSyag,753279,758320,homies i play madden with right and they  always picked it i could never get you  in the fantasy draft off the name yeah
1GcLU9rSyag,758320,764480,so i'm saying you match up with pac-man  do you feel like this pac-man like i  gotta 100 but it's the it's awesome do
1GcLU9rSyag,764480,771760,you do like this video  because like what you said it's like  even that you know you know how it is
1GcLU9rSyag,771760,776959,you go against a regular dude  i ain't got to do much film study i  ain't got to do much work i already know
1GcLU9rSyag,776959,783839,what time it is i'm going to get busy  but when it comes to pac-man and darrell  rivers of the world and you know i had
1GcLU9rSyag,783839,789360,some major better the champ baileys of  the world and you go on and on and on  yeah you got to do extra work you got to
1GcLU9rSyag,789360,795440,study and then when you go out there  those stories as well like you watch  pac-man throwing dudes smacking dudes
1GcLU9rSyag,795440,802800,taking  balls to the crib so 100  thing  verbatim with me um
1GcLU9rSyag,802800,809680,i really didn't like playing against  guys that wasn't a big name yeah you  know i mean because i was so intrigued  about me locking it down and when i go
1GcLU9rSyag,809680,815800,back all my knees in the hood i'm like  yeah why you held a b the guy yeah
1GcLU9rSyag,821920,829839,and make pancakes and turn it into a  sandwich with the eggs for those [ __ ]  out there pac-man jones is like a.i of
1GcLU9rSyag,829839,836959,football  i appreciate it no it's like nah  literally like no you're just that [ __ ]  yo and i and again this is gonna sound
1GcLU9rSyag,836959,842720,right it's gonna sound crazy right  because we all grown and we passed that  and we you know we on a higher level
1GcLU9rSyag,842720,848720,like when you used to go to when you  used to go to jail  i used to get like happy
1GcLU9rSyag,848720,856839,pac-man  so when you do something  i'll be like
1GcLU9rSyag,858510,862970,[Laughter]
1GcLU9rSyag,864880,870480,when you got drafted when you made it  when you caught an interception every  hood  you know what i'm saying made it to the
1GcLU9rSyag,870480,876480,nfl and it was the same thing with like  hey i went braving his hair where baggy  clothes like we felt like we all was in
1GcLU9rSyag,876480,881839,the nba so i got to give you that while  we're here man we had gilbert arenas on  the show
1GcLU9rSyag,881839,888240,and i asked him yo name your top five  petty people  he said kanye he said drake

1GcLU9rSyag,895440,901199,yeah what is your top five that's that's  a good one  i'm definitely i'm definitely up there
1GcLU9rSyag,901199,906399,um  gil gill petty he's ready yeah now gail  gill petty yeah

1GcLU9rSyag,919440,925040,few words might be be misspelled on  accident or purpose or whatever but it's
1GcLU9rSyag,925040,931199,to be he's going to say what he want to  say it's going to be committed now me  my level of petty is like educated you
1GcLU9rSyag,931199,938399,know what i'm saying because i'm well  spoken i'm also a hood  and i'm funny so it's like i'm going to  give it to you
1GcLU9rSyag,950800,957279,and you know he had his time in rap and  it was a good time like at one time like  50 was that jimmy iveen was like maybe
1GcLU9rSyag,957279,962480,it was dre involved in this conversation  too is like yo y'all the beatles don't  break up the beatles
1GcLU9rSyag,962480,970160,that was jimmy no  yeah it was just uh me and jimmy iveen  in uh in jimmy's office with uh 50 and
1GcLU9rSyag,970160,975199,uh  and then we we uh flew to new york to go  squash the beef
1GcLU9rSyag,975199,983600,and um yeah once i got there it was  i don't know man i was feeling weird i  felt like i was in like a controlled
1GcLU9rSyag,983600,989680,environment where like where i was a  puppet and i didn't feel comfortable so  that's why when you look at the pictures
1GcLU9rSyag,989680,995519,i'm a little bit disoriented and uh you  know everybody else is kind of like  happy it's happening but i wasn't really
1GcLU9rSyag,995519,1001279,happy with that but i did it because i  was paid i got paid to do it i don't be  turning down no bags
1GcLU9rSyag,1001279,1007519,eminem  overrated underrated i say  i say slightly overrated
1GcLU9rSyag,1007519,1012880,slightly overrated  i think that it was the i think was the  time
1GcLU9rSyag,1012880,1019440,that he came in i think he came in with  dre and whenever you get whenever you  get certified by the black hand it helps
1GcLU9rSyag,1019440,1024480,you out and then there's you know  there's a thing called white privilege  too and like it is what it is like it
1GcLU9rSyag,1024480,1029918,ain't you can't it is what it is it  exists and it helps  can i push back on you a little bit you
1GcLU9rSyag,1029918,1038910,can do whatever you want to do i mean  ella you we good no you man  [Laughter]
1GcLU9rSyag,1048319,1055120,so we're talking about eminem right now  and uh  probably about 10 years ago
1GcLU9rSyag,1055120,1060160,you was doing an interview  i don't know who you were sitting down  with but you talked about like look no
1GcLU9rSyag,1060160,1066160,rapper want to go against him  you know what i'm saying he was like it  just don't make sense
1GcLU9rSyag,1066160,1073520,so now we're 10 years later  and now you know you you've been really  outspoken about your place in hip-hop
1GcLU9rSyag,1073520,1079279,history  or you know this whole eminem  conversation
1GcLU9rSyag,1079520,1086000,you know talk to me about like why  things have changed from that interview  from 10 years ago when all right when
1GcLU9rSyag,1086000,1091600,you was  four years old  did you need help crossing the street  yeah 100
1GcLU9rSyag,1091600,1098160,what about when you're 14  you know i was good  10 years a long time
1GcLU9rSyag,1098160,1104640,how i felt back then  i don't feel i don't feel the same and  the reason i felt like that back then
1GcLU9rSyag,1104640,1113280,because i was part of uh  i was part of a unit and i was part of a  family still still and again when i like
1GcLU9rSyag,1113280,1118960,even before i was signed to aftermath  they put eminem
1GcLU9rSyag,1118960,1126000,on a pedestal you know what i'm saying  interscope put the bag behind them  media which is predominantly run by
1GcLU9rSyag,1126000,1131200,white people which is of which i'm glad  that we have i am athletes and the  million dollars worth of games and all
1GcLU9rSyag,1131200,1136880,these different podcasts we can come  down and sit down with people that look  like us and talk about real and i know
1GcLU9rSyag,1136880,1142080,it's going to get out there and what my  words are not going to get misconstrued  now we have this platform but back then
1GcLU9rSyag,1142080,1147679,we didn't have that it was whatever they  say goes this is where the bag is mtv  y'all better do what we said y'all
1GcLU9rSyag,1147679,1153200,better do because we gave you all the  money i got the money right yeah uh okay  bt y'all got the money right okay y'all
1GcLU9rSyag,1153200,1159200,got the money okay uh uh whoever like  whatever the media outlet is  they're paid to do it they're still paid
1GcLU9rSyag,1159200,1165840,to do it it's called promotion companies  put the bags behind the biggest artists  you know what i'm saying so if you are
1GcLU9rSyag,1165840,1172160,and let's just say  adele right if you are a dale you're  getting a bag behind you now so now uh
1GcLU9rSyag,1172160,1178400,some a singer that it can sing just as  good as adele  on the same or a different label might
1GcLU9rSyag,1178400,1183840,not get the bag behind her it really  breaks down to the politics inside of  the building
1GcLU9rSyag,1183840,1190559,and let's just say this girl who can  sing just as good as adele don't wanna  and i'm not this isn't about a deal but
1GcLU9rSyag,1190559,1196160,um let's say this girl doesn't  smile  at the anr the way that he thinks he
1GcLU9rSyag,1196160,1202559,should smile at her he might kill her  whole record he might go back and tell  the recorders that she don't have no  good music right it might never get to
1GcLU9rSyag,1202559,1208159,the channels so i'm saying they made  sure that eminem was going to be eminem  yeah it didn't matter if you listen to
1GcLU9rSyag,1208159,1214559,it or i'll listen to it or you listen to  it they they were going to make sure and  even if nobody listened to it they were  going to manipulate the numbers and do
1GcLU9rSyag,1214559,1221840,and put the bag where it needed to go so  that  it can be it could seem the way that it  seemed and i was a fan of that too i was
1GcLU9rSyag,1221840,1227600,a fan of dr dre and hi my name is that  came out of nowhere i'm not saying that  eminem can't rap and he's not an amazing
1GcLU9rSyag,1227600,1236720,rapper all i ever said was just he just  not better than me right now if you put  if you put 200 million behind drillmatic
1GcLU9rSyag,1236720,1241840,i'm taking home 14 15 grammys this year  that's just what it is it's a system
1GcLU9rSyag,1241840,1248559,right it's just like the nfl it's you  both all three of y'all we all athletes  y'all professional and me earl manner
1GcLU9rSyag,1248559,1253919,goat or something  but you know for a fact that there's out  there in the hood that never made it to
1GcLU9rSyag,1253919,1258960,the nfl they could run faster than  pac-man jones and they could catch  better right but they might have had a
1GcLU9rSyag,1258960,1264159,bad attitude  cussed out the wrong coach you ain't get  to visit because you know what i'm
1GcLU9rSyag,1264159,1269760,saying because this was a safer athlete  it's like the super bowl the reason i  the real reason i wasn't on the super
1GcLU9rSyag,1269760,1275600,bowl is because i'm not a safe artist  you don't know what game gonna do when  you get up there so it's just like he's
1GcLU9rSyag,1275600,1281679,not safe so they went with the safe  artist how did you how did you feel  about that i feel like this i'm gonna  put the t down cause i don't even need
1GcLU9rSyag,1281679,1288400,the team okay okay  for this  i feel like
1GcLU9rSyag,1288400,1295679,the super bowl is in la right  um  it's a dr dre super bowl but it is jay-z
1GcLU9rSyag,1295679,1301440,um but jay-z understands the dynamics of  west coast hip-hop very well right and i
1GcLU9rSyag,1301440,1307120,don't think jay-z would have had a  problem if dre would have said  we'd bring a game on the super bowl you
1GcLU9rSyag,1307120,1312240,had a flight of classic number one  outside of myself outside of myself i
1GcLU9rSyag,1312240,1317360,also think like i also think that yg  should have been on the super bowl but  that's just but you're older than yg
1GcLU9rSyag,1317360,1323440,though it's not it's just it's not that  it's the rules la it's l.a if if yo if
1GcLU9rSyag,1323440,1328799,it was a new york super bowl you might  have saw jay-z you might have saw nas  you might have saw mary j and 5eo
1GcLU9rSyag,1328799,1336080,foreign and alicia keynes you might have  saw anybody because we on the west coast  are the only [ __ ] that have this crab
1GcLU9rSyag,1336080,1342240,in the barrel mentality where we want to  keep  down or don't do things based on what
1GcLU9rSyag,1342240,1347360,somebody else might think it looks like  snoop dogg was there because snoop dogg
1GcLU9rSyag,1347360,1353200,is  safe and he a legend it's like snooze  my grandmother you're my grandmother no
1GcLU9rSyag,1353200,1360000,snow and so do my children you know what  i'm saying so it's like snoop is an icon  dre is the icon m is the icon but emma's
1GcLU9rSyag,1360000,1366640,not from la 50 is not from la and i'm  not taking away from the fact that they  were on the super bowl but l.a
1GcLU9rSyag,1366640,1372640,been on a detroit super bowl or a new  york super bowl it just wouldn't have  happened you know what i'm saying you
1GcLU9rSyag,1372640,1378640,wouldn't have needed snoop dogg on a  super bowl in new york and it wouldn't  it would  it wouldn't have been like that so it's
1GcLU9rSyag,1378640,1384480,like  if it's in la right and you tell me if  i'm wrong y'all three row if it's in la
1GcLU9rSyag,1384480,1389840,and we're doing a super bowl in l.a and  it's dr dre super bowl  and
1GcLU9rSyag,1389840,1395280,all that i've done for this city and and  i'm not i'm an a-list artist and i'm
1GcLU9rSyag,1395280,1401679,still in the streets ten toes down every  day every single [ __ ] day i ain't  walking around

1GcLU9rSyag,1656880,1662480,because i feel like  from out you know from the outside  looking in because i know you right when
1GcLU9rSyag,1662480,1668880,i said that i meant it and the reason  that i said it the way that i said it it  just came out like that and then the
1GcLU9rSyag,1668880,1675440,whoever anybody that heard it was able  to watch that uh that podcast just took  it away you know took it at face value
1GcLU9rSyag,1675440,1681440,for what i said without me being able to  truly understand what i meant um at that  time kanye had put me in a room with
1GcLU9rSyag,1681440,1688320,elon musk  and put me in a room with a few other  you know people you know that really
1GcLU9rSyag,1688320,1695039,makes happen in the world and really got  money and i was able to afford some  friendships and some contacts that yes
1GcLU9rSyag,1695039,1700480,and it wasn't so it wasn't really  knowing drake it's just like billionaire  mindset again i don't even with jimmy
1GcLU9rSyag,1700480,1705520,iveene and dre and back in the day those  rooms that that 50 and and uh eminem
1GcLU9rSyag,1705520,1710960,were allowed to walk in i never got the  invite again like the super bowl i could  have met
1GcLU9rSyag,1710960,1717919,anybody this is the opportunities that  hove gave me gave meek mill put the  position that whole put meek mill and yo
1GcLU9rSyag,1717919,1723679,gotti in by affiliating himself with  those younger artists has meek in there  with robert kraft and doing all these
1GcLU9rSyag,1723679,1730640,great things for philly and doing all  that  when it when it comes to me  it's always lead me out of the room in
1GcLU9rSyag,1730640,1736799,the conversation so yeah you would never  say i'm better than eminem because they  are not putting me in the places where
1GcLU9rSyag,1736799,1743200,my talents can be  you know what i'm saying yeah and it can  be magnified yeah and that's why you
1GcLU9rSyag,1743200,1749440,know i've always respected you too  because like  your classic battles with eminem
1GcLU9rSyag,1749440,1754799,50 cent jimmy all them you always  kept
1GcLU9rSyag,1754799,1760640,dre right here you know what i'm saying  that was the first time people was like  damn like you never did that right you
1GcLU9rSyag,1760640,1767039,know what i'm saying that's why i took  everybody  you know back right like  and since we all since we are here and

1GcLU9rSyag,2406640,2411920,does that mean  like  did put the description this is
1GcLU9rSyag,2411920,2417520,this is the realest form of of rap music  that you are going to get
1GcLU9rSyag,2417520,2426720,from a  artist in 2022. bro bro this sound like  a farewell bro nah man 42 40 42 43 i'm

1GcLU9rSyag,2432800,2439839,i'm here here's my art like i'm on my  lab my last album was a few years ago so  i like i wanted to make sure that my  fans had everything they needed and i i
1GcLU9rSyag,2439839,2446560,was only gonna put 19 on an album but i  kept recording and so i started to fall  in love with more music and i was like
1GcLU9rSyag,2446560,2452880,if i make a song that can take another  song off the album i'll just replace it  but everything was so phenomenal you
1GcLU9rSyag,2452880,2458079,know what i'm saying and there's no  limits because i create like i own all  my vid now so it's like i'm gonna give
1GcLU9rSyag,2458079,2464480,my fans  and hip-hop as a whole  all hip-hop fans and all genres a album
1GcLU9rSyag,2464480,2471280,that is just undeniably classic you got  a whole one over here nah i don't got  hove on it and that was yo
1GcLU9rSyag,2471280,2477040,that would and that would have been  amazing but you know i always put your  passion in there this album is so crazy  it don't it don't need hope on it right
1GcLU9rSyag,2477040,2483040,it just it just doesn't right and that  would be amazing but it don't it don't  need that how how does an artist how
1GcLU9rSyag,2483040,2490240,does a a rapper retire  does a rapper you ever retire as an  athlete we know when or they tell us
1GcLU9rSyag,2490240,2495440,when to hang them up  you  you meet an untimely demise or fans hang
1GcLU9rSyag,2495440,2502160,you up  that's it it's two ways the lyric law  what you feel about this man that's it's
1GcLU9rSyag,2502160,2508560,real [ __ ] that's  the lyric law is them able to use your  your rap lyrics in your in your trial
1GcLU9rSyag,2508560,2514319,and and use that to like pack you up on  some rico uh what i'm saying is they  don't know what they're doing when
1GcLU9rSyag,2514319,2520160,when when arnold schwarzenegger plays  terminator and he's shooting and killing  you don't go take the move terminator
1GcLU9rSyag,2520160,2527440,one through three and go take that to  his trial and like say that he's a rope  a machine killer like man like a lot of
1GcLU9rSyag,2527440,2532960,these rappers and i'm not saying thug  and gunnar but a lot of these rappers  these days are capping and doing what's
1GcLU9rSyag,2532960,2539200,culturally appropriate for the rap  median  today and so that should not be used
1GcLU9rSyag,2539200,2545599,against these kids in court that's just  trash and it is a system setup i mean  it's a system made for all
1GcLU9rSyag,2545599,2551280,african american artists to  number one  fall for your masters to fall in the
1GcLU9rSyag,2551280,2557280,hands of nasa and for us to be fighting  back for what we own uh rightfully so so
1GcLU9rSyag,2557280,2563040,again  i don't support that and i think there  needs to be a law passed in congress  where that cannot be used in these
1GcLU9rSyag,2563040,2568800,trials because it's rendering black men  helpless and i don't like it at all  how's your kid like being a dad
1GcLU9rSyag,2568800,2575440,you know what i mean man that is uh  that's a it's an amazing process man to
1GcLU9rSyag,2575440,2582079,watch a child being born watching grow  and then turn into a man my oldest is uh
1GcLU9rSyag,2582079,2588480,19 at the you know he's going to college  now which is crazy because that's the  baby from the documentary he was only
1GcLU9rSyag,2588480,2595359,he was eight months on that cover  um so it's just it's it's crazy  yeah yeah yeah it's crazy to watch your
1GcLU9rSyag,2595359,2600400,child become a man because uh if  and your fatherhood kicks into overtime
1GcLU9rSyag,2600400,2605440,um everybody's been overtime you know  what i'm saying all y'all professional  athletes um fatherhood kicks into
1GcLU9rSyag,2605440,2611839,overtime when your child becomes 18 and  you have to then  over parent because of the world that
1GcLU9rSyag,2611839,2618000,you live in in the state that it's in  look what's going on man this world  there's so much of it happening to all
1GcLU9rSyag,2618000,2626400,races and all creeds and all people that  you got to go  over time  in tutoring your children and being uh
1GcLU9rSyag,2626400,2633760,you know a teacher man because it's so  much to watch out for man the internet  being one um hateful people racism being
1GcLU9rSyag,2633760,2640319,the craziest that i've ever seen in my  life um because  of all the different forms and facets
1GcLU9rSyag,2640319,2647119,that comes in um it's just look at the  buffalo that was terrible the yuvaldi uh  shooting terrible man but it doesn't
1GcLU9rSyag,2647119,2652240,erase the ones before it's just like  damn still and what do we do now we we
1GcLU9rSyag,2652240,2658800,let's go march let's go put on our black  shirts and stomp the street like nah man  we it's  something else got to break man because
1GcLU9rSyag,2658800,2664480,all the protesting and all the uh black  lives matter and all that and all that  it's not working man cause people still
1GcLU9rSyag,2664480,2670880,[ __ ] over people and i don't like it  one bit so again my parenting is in  overtime like mine's got to make it
1GcLU9rSyag,2670880,2676400,and if they don't  i'm gonna wring hell because they they  all i got don't know people i hate to
1GcLU9rSyag,2676400,2682480,even think or something like that every  day every day i got three children that  go in three different directions and i'm
1GcLU9rSyag,2682480,2688400,i'm putting faith into the world and  teachers and schools to make sure that
1GcLU9rSyag,2688400,2694480,they get back home safe to me and that's  the process to have to go through day in  and day out as a parent
1GcLU9rSyag,2694480,2700240,so in  in sports we have agents you know what i  mean when we went on our contract we
1GcLU9rSyag,2700240,2706079,call our age hey  hey peter i need you to work going here  tell these folks i want 10 million a
1GcLU9rSyag,2706079,2712160,year if they can't do it release me i  want to go somewhere else  um  you need to rick james when you wanted
1GcLU9rSyag,2712160,2717280,out your country  i mean up on the table like hey
1GcLU9rSyag,2717280,2723520,i'm gonna do this the right way or  yeah man i'm fitting to get out of here  this this is way too many albums so so
1GcLU9rSyag,2723520,2730319,tell us about it man you tell us about  what happened i just and for me that  that's an important topic because like
1GcLU9rSyag,2730319,2736720,when you talk about it you never talk  about the room right you know like  i really want to take us into the room
1GcLU9rSyag,2736720,2742000,all right well basically man i was just  uh i was unhappy and i felt like after
1GcLU9rSyag,2742000,2747680,my first album at interscope because of  my you know the all the turmoil and
1GcLU9rSyag,2747680,2752960,because of the beef with uh you know  when i when you beat for 50 at that time
1GcLU9rSyag,2752960,2758079,50 was tied to eminem  eminem is  dre
1GcLU9rSyag,2758079,2763839,dre is jimmy iv and so it's a whole  family right here and you're on the
1GcLU9rSyag,2763839,2770079,outside looking in now because i decided  to not be a [ __ ] basically um i could
1GcLU9rSyag,2770079,2775520,have not said  about nothing i could have said  something different on phone flex that
1GcLU9rSyag,2775520,2781680,day and  right now be worth it probably 100 more  million 200 more million than i am
1GcLU9rSyag,2781680,2789280,but i i'm not able to sleep at night if  i don't walk in my truth so um i i spent
1GcLU9rSyag,2789280,2796000,the rest of  the four albums my next four albums  on the outside looking in like to just
1GcLU9rSyag,2796000,2801839,give me enough money to finish my album  i couldn't even shoot all the videos i  wanted to shoot because they would tell
1GcLU9rSyag,2801839,2807680,me my budget ran out or this or that and  i know what that is that was inside hate  from the powers that be
1GcLU9rSyag,2807680,2814880,who wanted to keep me down you know what  i'm saying it didn't want me to surpass  and it's like i couldn't never  understand that because
1GcLU9rSyag,2814880,2820079,dr dre didn't care if eminem was bigger  than dr dre or if he ever grew to that m
1GcLU9rSyag,2820079,2825119,didn't care if 50 was bigger than eminem  but when it came to me 50 didn't want he
1GcLU9rSyag,2825119,2830160,didn't  want anybody in the group to be bigger  than him and i caught that on i caught
1GcLU9rSyag,2830160,2836160,that light early and i wasn't with that  i wanted to be the biggest rapper in the  world and i knew that i had the talent
1GcLU9rSyag,2836160,2842880,and i knew that i had the skill and  i really didn't want to die in the hood  so i was giving it my all i wanted to be
1GcLU9rSyag,2842880,2849119,successful and trying to keep me from  being successful so i spoke out once i  spoke out about it
1GcLU9rSyag,2849119,2854160,just pushed me it left me to the side i  wasn't getting no you know love from dr
1GcLU9rSyag,2854160,2860319,dre like i was getting um you know on  the documentary um i wouldn't get the  building when i walked in the building
1GcLU9rSyag,2860319,2865599,building got caught just be typing it  and talking  i walk in and get everybody get quiet
1GcLU9rSyag,2865599,2872319,right so it's like after i dealt with it  for three hours and that's why you know  uh sometimes you didn't feel my passion
1GcLU9rSyag,2872319,2878160,in my albums bro cause i was in america  with no i couldn't and the internet  wasn't as big back then so you couldn't
1GcLU9rSyag,2878160,2885040,run to the internet and say something on  your live wasn't no live wasn't on  instagram none of that wasn't even  twitter so i'm saying i had to deal with
1GcLU9rSyag,2885040,2890160,it emotionally  contemplated suicide um you know like
1GcLU9rSyag,2890160,2896079,went went off on family members broke up  with you know  potential soulmates just going through
1GcLU9rSyag,2896079,2902640,the time as a young black man in music  and i felt alone so it's like once i
1GcLU9rSyag,2902640,2908960,once i went through hell and i made it  out the fire and i patted myself out and  i ain't had no third degree burns i was
1GcLU9rSyag,2908960,2915040,like oh we stronger than ever  so i was like yeah it's time to get off  this contract um birdman was offering me
1GcLU9rSyag,2915040,2920240,you know uh like  5 million or something to come over to  uh cash money he was going to take the

1GcLU9rSyag,3026079,3031599,doing that that's my story it's part of  who i am and i'm not even proud of that  but at the end of the day
1GcLU9rSyag,3031599,3038079,it is why i'm here and it is why i feel  as good as i do waking up looking in the  mirror at the man that i see and i can
1GcLU9rSyag,3038079,3044559,be like  and then the mirror be like  at the same time and so we're here

1GcLU9rSyag,3097280,3102480,the business first stop man get off the  piano and go study the business side
1GcLU9rSyag,3102480,3108480,first of whatever it is that you want to  do so that way your talents can match  your wit and that when you walk into
1GcLU9rSyag,3108480,3113760,these buildings man you start talking  you know the way that you need to talk
1GcLU9rSyag,3113760,3120319,you get what you deserve it's the the  difference between that the difference  between you getting what you deserve  deserving which and you not getting what

1GcLU9rSyag,3148400,3154079,some of the situations and had to hurdle  some of the things that i had to hurdle  so i'm telling everybody of oh i don't
1GcLU9rSyag,3154079,3160720,care what you're doing  the business side comes first stop what  you're doing  understand the business side 100
1GcLU9rSyag,3160720,3166800,and then start and then kick kick  kick your [ __ ] off language that's what  it is it's really language right like
1GcLU9rSyag,3166800,3173520,business is language if we speak the  same language we can sit at the table  together so that's a  yeah yeah and you you got to be able to
1GcLU9rSyag,3173520,3178880,play the game basically with each other  you know what i mean um  brandon had a good agent though brandon
1GcLU9rSyag,3178880,3185520,don't play for cheap that's one thing to  tell you about him  he's asian hey b you know how to get the
1GcLU9rSyag,3185520,3190640,money out squirrel boy i'm coming back  every year my dad is still getting paid
1GcLU9rSyag,3190640,3197440,10 12 a year right right  bro i mean it's just principle it's just  like you know where aaron donald had
1GcLU9rSyag,3197440,3202880,aaron donna on the show it's just like  yo  i know my value i know my worth exactly
1GcLU9rSyag,3202880,3208480,you know what i'm saying and he had to  teach me  how to be diplomatic with it and i'm  still
1GcLU9rSyag,3208480,3215040,going through those same challenges as a  black man running a media company you  know what i'm saying i had networks say
1GcLU9rSyag,3215040,3221680,well where's his agent  you know we want to talk to him like no  i'm the ceo founder of exactly what you
1GcLU9rSyag,3221680,3227119,mean  so we still playing it and i made some  mistakes but at the end of the day
1GcLU9rSyag,3227119,3233119,you know i'm in a better position  because of our football career lakers  you're a big lakers fan i'm a huge laker
1GcLU9rSyag,3233119,3238720,fan man a bigger fan of kobe than  anybody of course i grew up with mike uh
1GcLU9rSyag,3238720,3245440,michael jordan which is this is crazy  one of the one of the reasons that i am  a blood is because my favorite team was
1GcLU9rSyag,3245440,3250480,the bulls and like i just would not take  the red i would not take my bull's
1GcLU9rSyag,3250480,3256720,jersey off for nobody and so i grew up  in a [ __ ] neighborhood in the early  stages of my childhood and i can
1GcLU9rSyag,3256720,3261920,remember white boy t and leonis who  probably gonna watch this and be like  yeah
1GcLU9rSyag,3261920,3268720,you know what i'm saying but like  them know like i would not take my boy's  jersey off and so i had to go
1GcLU9rSyag,3268720,3273920,across the tracks to where where they  boy jersey all day and so uh you know  that's what it was so i ended up being a
1GcLU9rSyag,3273920,3279839,blood just yeah that's jordan's fault  yeah speaking of
1GcLU9rSyag,3280720,3286319,but lakers that's my team man kobe my  guy everybody is saying is uh
1GcLU9rSyag,3286319,3294640,uh the point got uh  russell russell westbrook fought right  how do you fix the lakers right now um
1GcLU9rSyag,3294640,3299839,hi  you gotta how do you fix the lakers  right now man you gotta
1GcLU9rSyag,3299839,3306720,it's like this man two you you know that  too many superstars on one team is like  it's only one basketball you know what
1GcLU9rSyag,3306720,3312160,i'm saying and so if the superstar is  lebron and you got  a.d
1GcLU9rSyag,3312160,3317920,i don't think you need to bring west  there i don't think you need to bring  russ there because russ is his own
1GcLU9rSyag,3317920,3324160,superstar and so russ needs to get with  maybe another one big superstar but i  don't need to be five on the same team
1GcLU9rSyag,3324160,3330799,like mello is coming off the bench i  don't never think carmelo should come  off nobody bench as long as he's going  to court because mello can give you 20
1GcLU9rSyag,3330799,3338319,30 40 whatever he feel like  russ needs the ball for what what is it  48 minutes russ russ got a rust need to
1GcLU9rSyag,3338319,3345119,ball off 38. i think but she just got to  be healthy yeah it ain't even that it's  just it's one basketball you need you
1GcLU9rSyag,3345119,3351839,need role players too you know what i'm  saying and not to i'm not saying that  you're not an amazing basketball player
1GcLU9rSyag,3351839,3357520,but you if if i'm michael jordan i need  like swaggy p you know what i'm saying i
1GcLU9rSyag,3357520,3363760,don't need charles barkley at the tool  and elijah wine at the five and patrick  ewing playing power forward and we're
1GcLU9rSyag,3363760,3369119,gonna lose because these these guys like  uh call will pope and and you know monk
1GcLU9rSyag,3369119,3376000,and these guys these these that these  jordan pools like these gotta get the  rock because these are guys like steve
1GcLU9rSyag,3376000,3382000,kerr and john paxton that can make  amazing [ __ ] happen that don't have a  shoe deal
1GcLU9rSyag,3382000,3388839,that's the latest problem i love it you  the gm you're gonna be we're gonna sign  you as a gm g-a-m-e but you
1GcLU9rSyag,3388839,3395520,know uh i want to go back to in the show  this way  you know you you
1GcLU9rSyag,3395520,3400640,flew through you know this this this the  sound bite you said during this during
1GcLU9rSyag,3400640,3407119,during that time when you were going  back and forth with interscope you know  you contemplated suicide
1GcLU9rSyag,3407119,3414160,um  talk a little bit about that  so suicide i understand it i understand
1GcLU9rSyag,3414160,3420160,it to be  exactly what it is right suicide is  taking your own life right or in
1GcLU9rSyag,3420160,3426880,layman's terms you could be committing  suicide if you do something that is  going to be career ending or something
1GcLU9rSyag,3426880,3434799,like that depending on what your what  genre of life we're talking about but  suicide as itself is a very very the
1GcLU9rSyag,3434799,3441359,thought process is a disease  um  how to overcome that is to empower
1GcLU9rSyag,3441359,3447359,yourself see a lot of people who are  struggling with their mental health and  and their capacity to understand that
1GcLU9rSyag,3447359,3454240,the love is love comes from within it  starts with you  don't have people around them to tell
1GcLU9rSyag,3454240,3459280,them these things so that's why i'm glad  that you touched on this because
1GcLU9rSyag,3459280,3465440,people that  commit suicide  are looked upon as weak
1GcLU9rSyag,3465440,3471920,weak people right  because they want to immediately do away  with life as we know it and all of the
1GcLU9rSyag,3471920,3476960,things that we have put value in we  don't want to commit suicide because our
1GcLU9rSyag,3476960,3482960,car  and our woman and you know our family or  or our shoe collection like ah if i kill
1GcLU9rSyag,3482960,3488079,myself i'm my chains like who gonna get  that like  people that kill themselves are these
1GcLU9rSyag,3488079,3493280,strongest people  on the planet  because do you know how much courage and
1GcLU9rSyag,3493280,3498480,strength it takes to  remove yourself from the earth yourself
1GcLU9rSyag,3498480,3506000,do you think that the yeah i think that  i i don't think that you you got to  understand the reverse
1GcLU9rSyag,3506000,3512400,i don't know about the same the same way  let's make it fun  saying is  what i'll let you finish
1GcLU9rSyag,3512400,3517920,you can finish here here if  if i gave you a gun right now
1GcLU9rSyag,3517920,3524640,you got to think about that  if i gave you a gun right now and told  you to shoot yourself stuff or shoot
1GcLU9rSyag,3524640,3530400,anything  shoot anything shoot anything you tell  me shoot before i shoot myself yeah but  here's the thing
1GcLU9rSyag,3530400,3537440,to shoot yourself  you have to be strongest  to to bypass all of the thoughts that it
1GcLU9rSyag,3537440,3543200,takes to keep yourself here you have to  get you have to you know how much man  look man i know what you're trying to do
1GcLU9rSyag,3543200,3550160,you know [ __ ] that you got to think  about  before you finally get to that act how  many days that you've had to endure that
1GcLU9rSyag,3550160,3556240,pain on that level we ain't went through  that pain and the reason why you can't  relate and i can't really relate see i
1GcLU9rSyag,3556240,3561599,understand it because i study it but the  reason you probably can't relate because  you haven't went through those days you
1GcLU9rSyag,3561599,3568160,know what i'm saying you probably felt  like at one point at a time like you  probably thought about it like damn man  i was just the day
1GcLU9rSyag,3568160,3573680,what if i killed myself what if it's  just a thought but it's people really  out there every single day they wake up
1GcLU9rSyag,3573680,3579839,as they last day on earth you're not  with them you're not inside them those  emotions to battle that to get to the
1GcLU9rSyag,3579839,3586400,final [ __ ] day  you got to be the strongest on earth to  get there well i'm telling you that well
1GcLU9rSyag,3586400,3593520,i respect your opinion you know and and  and for me that's all it is is an  opinion right i mean for me i think the
1GcLU9rSyag,3593520,3599440,strongest  is someone who  fights those thoughts  and actually overcomes it i think
1GcLU9rSyag,3599440,3604960,there's two population i think there's  people who fight those those those uh  those thoughts
1GcLU9rSyag,3604960,3611839,for a lifetime right and then  you know finally succumb to that  um but i also think i also think there's
1GcLU9rSyag,3611839,3619119,a population of folks it's like life is  tough and it's like i'm gonna take my  life i think that's a bigger population
1GcLU9rSyag,3619119,3626480,than those folks who fight those  thoughts every single day for a lifetime  i say that that i say i'm not saying
1GcLU9rSyag,3626480,3631599,you're wrong i'm not saying i'm right  i'm not saying i'm right i'm not saying  you're wrong or any of us what i say is  that
1GcLU9rSyag,3631599,3639440,i appreciate life in all facets because  i have amassed a  a a smooth fortune um i have children to
1GcLU9rSyag,3639440,3646480,live for and so it's not about me but  if but am i strong enough or weak enough
1GcLU9rSyag,3646480,3652160,to commit suicide on after going through  that i've went through i think i'm both
1GcLU9rSyag,3652160,3657839,i'm strong and i'm weak um and in that  is human and so we'll never have the
1GcLU9rSyag,3657839,3663920,answers because we can't dig somebody  out of the grave the grave that  committed suicide and ask them and so
1GcLU9rSyag,3663920,3669280,all we can do is research but then we're  the things that we're researching are
1GcLU9rSyag,3669280,3675599,only  human opinion too and human research too  and so even a person that studies
1GcLU9rSyag,3675599,3680960,suicide every single day of their life  still hasn't committed suicide to really
1GcLU9rSyag,3680960,3687200,understand it all i know is that  we the world as a whole  needs a lot more love than we've given
1GcLU9rSyag,3687200,3693359,each other and that will save a lot more  lives and so you have people like me and  you who are fighting different things
1GcLU9rSyag,3693359,3699520,we're all fighting different things on  certain days you know when you get in  your car when you get a loan and when  you go home and you getting up shots and
1GcLU9rSyag,3699520,3705440,you need to blow some steam off we all  go through those days and so we fighting  to stay alive
1GcLU9rSyag,3705440,3712000,other people don't have the same values  as us we're not all the same individuals  so i think that this even though we're
1GcLU9rSyag,3712000,3718319,wrapping up now this is a conversation  that i would love to talk to y'all y'all  for about again and maybe we have to do
1GcLU9rSyag,3718319,3724240,a part two about mental health of any  race and of all capacities so that we
1GcLU9rSyag,3724240,3731200,can really really dig and and what i'll  do is out there me to go do my homework  on as much suicide prevention and as
1GcLU9rSyag,3731200,3737119,much suicide assist and as much suicide  conversation and i dare all y'all to do  the same thing so that we are prepared
1GcLU9rSyag,3737119,3742640,to really unpack [ __ ] and have a real  conversation on how to save lives how to  preserve lives and how to appreciate you
1GcLU9rSyag,3742640,3748400,don't complete this  vision that's what's yeah that's a lot  of people that don't complete it like  they try yeah true
1GcLU9rSyag,3748400,3754720,but they don't really  i'm one yeah i have some dark hey i've  had some i've had some dark [ __ ] days
1GcLU9rSyag,3754720,3760319,dark days right you're looking at a  person who who is absolutely who doesn't  have a father because you know he died
1GcLU9rSyag,3760319,3766000,of a heart attack i got two deaf dead  siblings i've been shot i've lost  countless homies i've been to so many
1GcLU9rSyag,3766000,3771359,funerals that i contemplate if i want to  go to my mother's  i'm tired i'm just tired of getting
1GcLU9rSyag,3771359,3777520,dressed and going to see people in a box  that is psychological warfare with  myself i'm starting to get to a point
1GcLU9rSyag,3777520,3784720,where i just need to retain a picture or  a memory because it the process of  having to go to a funeral it drains you
1GcLU9rSyag,3784720,3790799,for out for however long until you work  yourself back up to feel good so anyway  man i love y'all and i i think that the
1GcLU9rSyag,3790799,3796480,world as a whole needs more love and we  don't we don't all got the answer sway  you know what i'm saying but but i'm
1GcLU9rSyag,3796480,3801520,down to do more research educate myself  and appreciate all facets of life and
1GcLU9rSyag,3801520,3808480,people to make us all better yeah but  thank you for you know opening up in in  and and creating a space to you know me
1GcLU9rSyag,3808480,3815280,by telling your story creating a space  for us to have this conversation because  there's people  going through this and the goal is
1GcLU9rSyag,3815280,3820319,to tell them like what you said you know  there there is more life we do need more
1GcLU9rSyag,3820319,3825520,love and continue to fight it ain't  because we all going through it let's  start the conversation so yeah and so
1GcLU9rSyag,3825520,3831359,anybody that is contemplating suicide  thinking about suicide  i take you know when i just said you
1GcLU9rSyag,3831359,3838160,have to be a strong person to act on it  i want you to reverse that and be strong  this way be strong back the way towards
1GcLU9rSyag,3838160,3843440,life right because i if i see you you if  i see you i'm i love you and i'm giving
1GcLU9rSyag,3843440,3851680,you a hug and i'm not saying every human  on earth because some days i don't be  feeling like  but for the most part i just exude love
1GcLU9rSyag,3851680,3857839,and positive energy and it goes back to  how we started this conversation when i  said i don't wake up with any malicious
