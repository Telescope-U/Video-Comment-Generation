dRlWjGqj2a8,80,4000,In this episode of what  westerners think of Palembang food  
dRlWjGqj2a8,4000,15920,"george eats spicy pempek, Pauly chokes on a red bean and Kyle tries to guess where Palembang is"
dRlWjGqj2a8,25200,29920,Could you introduce yourself? My name is Conrad  and i'm from New Zealand. My name's Cecil and  
dRlWjGqj2a8,29920,35600,"i'm from south Africa. I am Kyle Beaumont, my name is George from England, Levi Brown  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,35600,39359,and i'm from Australia. You might  recognize this guy this is Pauly Long  
dRlWjGqj2a8,39360,47680,The food i eat is not the same as the food  you eat. I eat raw organs.  
dRlWjGqj2a8,47680,51840,What's your experience with indonesian food?  Mie Goreng and Rendang.  
dRlWjGqj2a8,51840,57840,It's actually pretty decent to be fair. You're a  very cultured man. I wouldn't say that.
dRlWjGqj2a8,60240,68240,You may open your eyes. Oh wow is that worms? No. Is that jelly? What am i looking at right now?  
dRlWjGqj2a8,68240,74320,This is definitely better than what you normally eat.  
dRlWjGqj2a8,74320,81360,"There is shaved ice, we got beans in here. What is this? Are these little worms? What are these little guys?"
dRlWjGqj2a8,81360,88880,"You may try ES KACANG MERAH, cheers bro. We have the beans, i got the little  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,88880,94000,"worms, i got the bone marrow stuff, i'm gonna get  a little chunk of ice here. All right here we go"
dRlWjGqj2a8,96080,99680,"It's not really bad but, it's a very  strange texture. I mean it's not bad  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,99680,108080,"yeah is that banana? It's similar to off milk. Yeah condensed milk is nice, but this is  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,108080,111200,not horrible but it's not tasty. It would have been nice  
dRlWjGqj2a8,111200,117920,about six months ago. What is that what am i eating
dRlWjGqj2a8,120480,121600,like what does it taste?
dRlWjGqj2a8,121600,132000,I do like that. The paint water  
dRlWjGqj2a8,132000,137680,"is really messing me up right. I don't like it. This is not my style man, there's  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,137680,143760,something yellow in here so i'm gonna try that.  It's a big bite. I can smell it yeah that's the  
dRlWjGqj2a8,143760,147840,flavor comes from this.  Whatever that is it's fermented. The texture
dRlWjGqj2a8,148560,153360,"is also of durian,the texture. So is that  ENAK or is it a DENAK from you Pauly?"
dRlWjGqj2a8,153920,160400,"Wait what? Enak or Denak? I'm going to give this  one a DENAK man, this is not for me this is a DENAK."
dRlWjGqj2a8,160400,164319,"Wow yeah well at least at least you're honest, yeah i'm honest, yeah i'm straight forward  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,164320,169840,i'm not going to tell you it's good man if  it's not and it's not my style. this is really good
dRlWjGqj2a8,178560,183120,What would you rate it out of ten? Out of ten for  flavor yeah? Out of ten for taste.
dRlWjGqj2a8,183120,188879,Five out of ten. Five out of ten? Perfect  and george? Four. Four out of ten for a dessert?  
dRlWjGqj2a8,189520,193680,yeah it should have been a ten. It should have  been a ten. I love dessert as well i  
dRlWjGqj2a8,193680,201040,love dessert so much. I'll give it a six on a high  end six yeah. I would have to give it a seven then  
dRlWjGqj2a8,201920,206800,"go on mate. So six and seven out  of ten. Eight, wait you said seven"
dRlWjGqj2a8,208960,212160,I'm not gonna lie man this  is like a solid two for me
dRlWjGqj2a8,214720,218880,i think that's a joint lowest score. i'm sorry  i'm sorry but it's personal preference.
dRlWjGqj2a8,218880,231200,i've got a sweet tooth so for  me this is this is a ten bro. i i would love this if i was to have a dessert oh like if i was to  have dinner a nice dinner and finish my night this  
dRlWjGqj2a8,231200,237200,would be it. A lot of the Indonesian food they mix  sweet things with things that shouldn't be mixed  
dRlWjGqj2a8,237200,246080,with sweet things like the the prime example  is like cheese and dessert i don't know why  
dRlWjGqj2a8,246080,252080,indonesians put cheese on like doughnuts and cake..  Can i just say something here the number one dish  
dRlWjGqj2a8,252080,257360,"that's been voted on this show is actually pisang  keju which is banana cheese! Banana cheese, come on  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,258720,264960,"That is not okay, red flag, out of the game  you're out of here, i don't like it i hate it  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,264960,269520,i can't do it i'm telling you i'm from philly  the home of the cheesesteak we put cheese and  
dRlWjGqj2a8,269520,274639,steak and onions and bread it's delicious  why would you ever put sweet stuff in there  
dRlWjGqj2a8,274640,283040,you just don't. Pempek palembang. You may open your eyes. Am i saying it wrong? no uh the the 'K' is  
dRlWjGqj2a8,283040,287920,silent. Have you ever seen anything like this  before? kind of like dumplings. it's like gravy  
dRlWjGqj2a8,287920,294000,so i think the best way to do it is you pour the  gravy onto it and then.. Gravy
dRlWjGqj2a8,300720,301760,this might be really really nice
dRlWjGqj2a8,307040,312480,that's good looks like just about  it. There's fish inside of it. Is this fish?  
dRlWjGqj2a8,312480,317680,It's seafood. oh wow. Does it remind  you any of anything back in south africa? it's like  
dRlWjGqj2a8,317680,323840,"intestine and stuff. I don't mean like in taste.  I hope not. I love the sauce, this sauce is so nice."
dRlWjGqj2a8,326960,330000,Spicy. A lot of spiciness.. Can we get the water back out?
dRlWjGqj2a8,332240,338000,whoa all right well that is so funny all right  guys can we get a glass of water quick. It's not  
dRlWjGqj2a8,338000,344000,"that spicy bro, what do you mean? Like a chili  or something. Maybe that stuff is inside there  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,345280,350480,yeah i like that sauce. It's not bad. Yeah it's sweet  
dRlWjGqj2a8,350480,354400,chili yeah and sweet soy mixed together. The  sauce i love that sauce it's so nice it felt  
dRlWjGqj2a8,354400,358880,like it was going to be like made out of potato or  bread and it's made out of fish i think fish yeah  
dRlWjGqj2a8,359440,363520,seafood but it's some kind of seafood taste in  that now this is really good this is really good  
dRlWjGqj2a8,363520,370319,"This is a bit spicy. Very tasty, it's chewy but it's  great. i love it. so you think it's fish and do you  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,370320,375520,like it? i'm not a massive fish fan but it does  taste quite nice. I love the sauce i'll give  
dRlWjGqj2a8,375520,381360,it a 10. This sauce wow.. and and all together? The sauce  plus all of it all together? if that's not fish  
dRlWjGqj2a8,382320,388320,if that's not fish then it'd be maybe eight out  of ten for me. And if it is fish? i don't really like  
dRlWjGqj2a8,388320,392960,"fish, i like fish i mean.. I know i wouldn't like this. So seven's"
dRlWjGqj2a8,402640,406240,so six and a seven again so with  this one the sauce is beautiful  
dRlWjGqj2a8,406240,411520,The tanginess of it is great and then it  works well with the texture of the pepper  
dRlWjGqj2a8,411520,416000,"this one i'll give it an.. i'm gonna give  it a solid eight, wow yeah despite the  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,416720,420880,slime it's like the chili sauce i've nearly  died today it's just gonna hit me out of  
dRlWjGqj2a8,420880,427280,nowhere okay i'm mad that his wasn't spicy at all.  yeah six point seven five i'll just have to know  
dRlWjGqj2a8,427280,430720,what it's made of so i've got a weird thing  where i need to know what it is i'm eating  
dRlWjGqj2a8,430720,434960,"for me to enjoy it so if i know what it is i can  enjoy it so much more. Oh nice, mackerel. There you go"
dRlWjGqj2a8,443200,446080,You may open your eyes say it again
dRlWjGqj2a8,448880,449840, 
dRlWjGqj2a8,464400,468000,something went wrong there yeah it's gotta  be fish right yeah it's gotta be fish  
dRlWjGqj2a8,468000,473200,it looks like a nice big bit of fish especially  yeah it looks like salmon okay suck in guys
dRlWjGqj2a8,476400,476960, 
dRlWjGqj2a8,481040,485040,"oh that's good that you like it, that's  good yeah. What do you like about it?  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,485600,488720,"it's a bit creamy as well, it doesn't look  presentable. Do you like how it looks?  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,488720,495520,yeah it looks beautiful it looks great oh  it's interesting. Don't eat the bones bro
dRlWjGqj2a8,498880,499380,that's good
dRlWjGqj2a8,502400,509199,that's way better than sugar iced bean soup that's  really good this is actually something i would order 
dRlWjGqj2a8,509200,512479,in the restaurant probably. To be fair i mean if  someone brought this out for you like looking  
dRlWjGqj2a8,512479,517519,like that would you be happy? This is intriguing for sure. It's not too spicy  
dRlWjGqj2a8,518800,525200,and the fish is really good it's really cooked  beautifully and not spicy. No spicy for me bro.  
dRlWjGqj2a8,526800,530800,So in there actually.. there's a fruit and there's actually  
dRlWjGqj2a8,530800,535120,fish sweet potato and chili?
dRlWjGqj2a8,535120,539360,What's this jelly stuff?
dRlWjGqj2a8,539360,546959,"There is durian inside. Really? There is. No way, no way. It's very good. Do you think the jelly works?"
dRlWjGqj2a8,558000,561360,I don't like fish - i'm not a massive  fish fan.
dRlWjGqj2a8,562000,566480, 
dRlWjGqj2a8,573600,580000,there we go. All right just for taste - that's really  good. Okay so what's your rating on 10 for it? I'll  
dRlWjGqj2a8,580000,586240,"give it an eight, yeah that's a pretty high  score. A six for me. A six for you? I'll give it  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,586240,592399,an eight. An eight out of ten? I like it. Okay that's  really good. Like a seven. Seven out of ten? It's  
dRlWjGqj2a8,592400,598080,like a solid seven - it's a fair rating. Flavor  wise i'll give it an eight out of ten.
dRlWjGqj2a8,598080,603840,For flavor i'll give it a 9/10.
dRlWjGqj2a8,606720,610480,That's way too generous. The flavor's  nice. Seven out of ten - I would go higher but  
dRlWjGqj2a8,610480,617839,there's too many bones in  it way too many bones yeah
dRlWjGqj2a8,630400,632720,would you introduce this to  philadelphia i don't think  
dRlWjGqj2a8,632720,634560,a single person in philadelphia would eat this
dRlWjGqj2a8,637280,640080,philadelphia is probably one of  the dirtiest cities of junk food  
dRlWjGqj2a8,640720,644720,"that's in the entire world. Great, thanks for having us bro very good"
dRlWjGqj2a8,652000,656480,because like i said i wouldn't normally eat this  kind of food. So in last place with a rating of  
dRlWjGqj2a8,656480,663440,"5.8 we have Es kacang merah, in second place we have  pempek palembang which means the winner of today's  "
dRlWjGqj2a8,663440,669760,episode and the best food rated by westerners for  palembang is brengkes tempoyak the fish and  
dRlWjGqj2a8,669760,676320,durian mix narrowly beats the favorite - pempek by a  margin of 0.2. unfortunately palembang food hasn't  
dRlWjGqj2a8,676320,681760,made it to our leaderboard but find out next week  what our guests really think about bandung food  
dRlWjGqj2a8,681760,682260,where we have Keanu Campora joining us as well  as The lost boys and the highly requested
dRlWjGqj2a8,682260,695520,gypsy in sneakers and hopefully we can get Bandung  food into the leaderboard. See you next time!
