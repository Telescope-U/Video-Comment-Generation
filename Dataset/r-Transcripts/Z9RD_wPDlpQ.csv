Z9RD_wPDlpQ,500,1935,"From calorie count to portion sizes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1935,3403,we wanted to find out all the differences
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,3403,6039,between Popeyes in the UK and the US.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,6039,7374,"This is ""Food Wars."""
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,11478,14146,The fountain drinks at Popeyes come in three sizes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,14147,16316,"The small, which is 22 ounces,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,16316,18852,"the medium, which is 30 ounces,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,18852,23689,"and the large, which is, of course, 40 ounces."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,23690,25458,40 ounces.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,26559,27961,That's so much soda.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,27961,29963,"In the UK, drinks only come in two sizes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,29963,32231,as a kids size or as a regular size.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,32231,33699,"We're not sure how much is in either of these,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,33700,35235,so we're going to measure them both.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,35235,36903,A little over 300.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,42208,43610,About 450.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,47881,49749,"But those aren't the biggest, I say!"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,49749,51151,"Actually, at the Popeyes in the US,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,51151,53887,you can also get a gallon of sweet tea
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,54754,56456,and unsweetened tea.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,56456,60226,One whole gallon.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,60226,61828,"Ah, look at this!"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,61828,63563,"Gallon, gallon."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,63563,65899,"Oh, and don't you hate when dummies do that thing"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,65899,66733,"where they're like,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,66733,69836,"""Hey, the medium is the same size as the large!"""
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,69836,71805,"And it never is, it's a total con, so."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,71805,73706,"Medium soda, large cup."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,77644,79912,"Oh, wow, guys!"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,79913,81548,"The medium's about the same size as the large,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,81548,83783,"except for, like, oh, I don't know, 10 ounces!"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,83783,85217,Dumb TikTokers. You guys aren't even ...
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,85218,87087,out-of-your-league TikTokers.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,87087,90522,I'm the fast-food king online! All right?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,93960,95395,When was this cleaned last?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,98865,102569,"Ooh,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,102569,104571,I'm gonna go 36. What do you think?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,104571,106639,"I mean, it could have been the amount to top of this cup,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,106639,109609,"but again, you can't fill this to the brim."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,109609,110844,You have to put a cap on it.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,110844,113246,"In the UK, fries just come as a regular serving."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,113246,116716,"US, we got two Popeyes fries sizes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,116716,117784,a regular and a large.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,117784,119519,"The regular, as we have here,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,119519,121888,"just came with the side of the three-piece we got here,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,121888,123223,"and of course a large,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,123223,126626,which is a box of just fries.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,126626,127594,Harry: We're going to weigh these to see
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,127594,129162,how they compare to the US.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,129162,130729,"Joe: We, of course, now are going to also"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,130729,133299,weigh our largest fry.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,134400,139139,Do not sleep on these fries.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,139139,140640,You'll be surprised to learn
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,140640,144110,that the inside of this scale is disgusting.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,144110,145745,A Popeyes chicken sandwich in the UK
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,145745,149649,weighs exactly 250 grams.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,149649,151784,"Joe: In the US, it weighs"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,151784,155355,270 grams.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,155355,157556,"In the US, Popeyes signature chicken"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,157557,159692,comes in seven serving sizes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,159692,160627,We'll start with these.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,160627,162762,"So, of course, the one-piece kids meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,162762,166599,"then you can upgrade to a two-piece regular meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,166599,168801,"which comes with a side and a biscuit,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,168801,170903,"or you can get yourself the three-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,170904,174307,and a four-piece. Side and a biscuit.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,174307,175909,"From there, you can get yourself"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,175909,177976,"an eight-piece family meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,177977,180914,"the 12-piece for the family as well,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,180914,182949,"or just for one person over a weekend,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,182949,186386,"and the largest, the 16-piece."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,186386,187453,Are you kidding me?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,187453,188454,[laughs]
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,188454,191590,How absurd is this? Look at all this chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,191591,193159,"In the UK, the signature chicken comes"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,193159,194494,"as a two-piece meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,194494,195828,"as a three-piece meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,195828,197263,"as a six-piece sharer,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,197263,198531,"as a nine-piece sharer,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,198531,200900,"or our largest size, the 12-piece sharer."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,200900,202502,"Let's weigh a wing, a thigh, and a leg"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,202502,204137,to see whose chickens are bigger.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,205305,207540,"So, in the UK, our thigh, leg, and wing combo"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,207540,209508,came to around 290 grams.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,210910,214214,"Here we go. First guy up, the leg."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,214214,217050,"Next up, got that wing."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,217050,218117,Kind of a wimpy-looking one.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,218117,220119,"And this one, the thigh."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,226626,227860,How 'bout the tendies?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,227860,230230,"In the US, we have these following sizes:"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,230230,231898,"A kids meal has a one-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,231898,235267,but what's up? They gave us two!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,235268,236869,"And then from there you get a three-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,236869,238037,"which they forgot,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,239138,241174,"and then we have five-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,241174,242308,"comes with a side and a biscuit,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,242308,243243,eight pieces.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,243243,245578,I feel like they're getting bigger as I go along.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,245578,246980,Look at the size of this tender.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,246980,249649,Then we have the 12-piece.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,249649,251284,"I mean, guys, this is like a --"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,251284,252285,look at this!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,252285,253686,Did you know they're this big?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,253686,256189,This is fantastic. I love how big these are.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,256189,258423,"That's what I'm talking about, Popeyes! Thank you."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,258424,261060,"And, of course, the 16-piece."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,261060,262395,Look at this bad boy.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,262395,264129,Look at the size of these guys.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,264130,266633,"Tenders in the UK come in four portion sizes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,266633,268568,"as a two-piece, which is the kids meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,268568,272772,"as a three-piece, a five-piece, and an eight-piece."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,272772,274140,Next up is the nuggets.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,274140,275908,These can be found in servings of
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,275908,277509,"a four-piece kids meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,277510,279145,"a six-piece kids meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,279145,280280,"eight-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,280280,281914,"the 12-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,281914,283616,"24-piece,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,283616,285218,"36 pieces,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,285218,288054,"and then this double pile right here,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,288054,290990,"the biggest order, 48 pieces."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,290990,293793,"And I have to say, does not look like enough."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,293793,297730,I know I could destroy that 48-piece with confidence.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,298665,299499,What do we got here?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,299499,301768,"Oh, look at this sticker! This is fun."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,301768,303202,"Yeah, look at these guys!"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,303202,304804,"Look at this big one playing a saxophone,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,304804,306472,how fun is that?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,306472,307573,"That's cool, right?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,307573,309309,"In the UK, we actually call our nuggets bites,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,309309,310810,and they come in the following sizes:
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,310810,312445,"There's a four-piece, which is a kids meal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,312445,315081,"a six-piece, a nine-piece, and a 12-piece."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,315081,316682,"Unfortunately, we couldn't get these today."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,316683,318985,"USA, we got biscuits, baby."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,318985,321154,These are the not-cookie biscuits
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,321154,323189,"that have come up before in other ""Food Wars"" episodes."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,323189,325191,"These are the biscuits biscuits,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,325191,327860,"and at Popeyes, you can get them in one,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,327860,330430,either on its own or probably with just about every meal.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,330430,332832,You can also get them in six.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,332832,334400,"It's, like, rolling right down here."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,334400,336636,And you can also get them in 12.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,336636,338570,Just overflowing biscuits over here.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,339505,341674,We actually do have biscuits on the UK Popeyes menu.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,341674,344110,"If you order it as a side, you get one biscuit."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,344110,347847,The biggest single item you can get on the US Popeyes menu
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,347847,350449,"is this, the Bigger Family Feast."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,350450,353419,"It comes with 12 pieces of chicken,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,353419,354787,"five chicken sandwiches,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,354787,358524,"two large sides, got the slaw and the mashed potatoes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,358524,361761,"five biscuits, and five apple pies."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,361761,364629,This entire thing will set you back about 60 bucks
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,364630,368000,"and clocks in at 10,000 calories"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,368000,370303,"if you choose a more calorific side, like the fries."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,370303,371604,I did not.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,371604,373373,"That pretty much dwarfs our largest single item,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,373373,375073,"which is this, the 12-piece sharer."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,375074,377643,"You get 12 pieces of chicken, four regular sides,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,377643,379412,"four biscuits, and four drinks,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,379412,381914,"all for the price of 24 pounds and 95 pence,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,381914,385017,which was around $33.50 at the time of recording.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,387887,388820,Mm.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,388821,390456,We're so bad at fried chicken in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,390456,392125,We just don't do it well.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,392125,394727,"But this, I gotta say,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,394727,397263,I feel like a certain Kentucky-based chain
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,397263,398598,"has had the monopoly for far too long,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,398598,399599,and they've let their standards slip.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,399599,401100,So this is really good.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,401100,402135,I'm thrilled that the standards
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,402135,403836,are hopefully going to get raised.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,408007,410343,And here's everything you can find at a US Popeyes
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,410343,412612,you won't find in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,412612,413913,And here are most of the things you'll find
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,413913,416215,at a UK Popeyes that you won't find in the US.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,416215,417083,Let's start with the chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,417083,419786,There are two main exclusive chicken options in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,419786,423022,"Firstly in the UK, we can get a chicken sandwich deluxe."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,423022,424290,"It's just a Popeyes chicken sandwich,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,424290,426626,but there's cheese and lettuce on here as well.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,428594,429429,What he means to say
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,429429,430930,is they took a delicious chicken sandwich
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,430930,433132,and added a bunch of junk.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,433132,435634,"Deluxe means vegetables,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,435635,439405,aka the junk I don't want on my crispy chicken sandwich.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,439405,441307,Popeyes in the UK also sell hot wings.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,441307,445978,"These come in orders of three, five, eight, 12, or 20."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,445978,447280,"Now, it might surprise some American viewers,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,447280,448247,but London in particular
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,448247,449749,"has a pretty big chicken-shop culture,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,449749,451483,"and we're pretty passionate about our hot wings,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,451484,453119,so let's see how these measure up.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,453119,454520,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,454520,457923,"Don't get it twisted. We're the wings country,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,457924,459025,and we should have those.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,459025,460960,I have no idea why we don't have those.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,464597,466264,That to me is a very good chicken wing.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,466265,468301,"Good level of heat, very crispy on the outside,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,468301,470669,"very juicy on the inside, what more can you want?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,470670,473473,We only have one exclusive chicken item.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,473473,474474,"Well, it's technically not an item,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,474474,475942,it's more of a style of chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,475942,477008,"Both in the US and the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,477009,478711,"they have the spicy and they have the regular,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,478711,481647,but we also have something called the blackened chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,481647,484016,"It is a chicken option without breading,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,484016,485718,"therefore, who cares?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,485718,487953,And it comes in the form of sandwich or tenders.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,487954,490389,"Here it is, blackened chicken."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,490389,492592,It's called fried chicken for a reason.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,492592,495027,"This is just, like, cooked on a grill?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,495027,497463,Grilled chicken at Popeyes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,497463,499131,What is wrong with you?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,501133,502435,Oh.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,502435,503503,Nope.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,503503,504537,"In both the UK and the US,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,504537,505771,"Popeyes chicken sandwiches,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,505771,507273,"fried chicken, and chicken tenders"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,507273,509342,are available as either classic or spicy.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,509342,511410,One interesting fact is that someone from Popeyes told us
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,511410,513612,that the UK version of the spicy chicken
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,513612,515647,"is actually hotter than it is in America,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,515648,517216,after they tried it on some focus groups
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,517216,519352,and they kept asking them to crank up the heat.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,519352,521654,"Who said British people can't handle spices, huh?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,525791,526859,"Now, this is not an exclusive"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,526859,528160,because it's available in both countries.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,528160,529561,"However, this is my first time"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,529562,531697,trying an American-style biscuit.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,531697,532965,"Now, the obvious statement is that, to me,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,532965,534667,this just looks like a scone.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,534667,536602,"The color is there, the shape is there,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,536602,538838,the kind of flaky layers are there.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,538838,540072,It even kind of smells like a scone.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,540072,541941,And the fact that this is being served with fried chicken
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,541941,544644,to me and to I think most British people is really weird.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,547980,549748,"Don't get me wrong, this is tasty,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,549749,551417,I'm just still struggling to see any differences
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,551417,553286,between this and a British scone.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,553286,555421,"Popeyes in the US doesn't just serve chicken,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,555421,557323,"it also has seafood,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,557323,559125,something you can't find in the UK Popeyes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,559125,561394,"Now, the US Popeyes did for a while"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,561394,563062,"have a Cajun flounder sandwich,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,563062,565765,which is a fried flounder fillet in a bun
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,565765,567600,with some pickles and tartar sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,567600,569802,"At the recording of this, it is no longer available."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,569802,571070,I don't know if it was a limited-time thing
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,571070,573172,"or they just stopped, they're taking a break, I don't know."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,573172,574941,But you can still get the popcorn shrimp.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,574941,576008,This is it.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,576008,580346,And it comes in a quarter-pound serving.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,580346,581714,"There are no seafood options in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,581714,583015,but we do have one vegan option
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,583015,584183,"which you guys don't have in the US,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,584183,585985,and that's the Creole red bean sandwich.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,585985,588087,This is a 100% plant-based red bean patty
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,588087,590289,"with some tomato, some lettuce, and a Creole sauce,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,590289,592325,but unfortunately we weren't able to get one today.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,592325,593626,I will say the Popeyes menu in the US
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,593626,595261,"doesn't look very vegetarian-friendly,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,595261,596662,"so maybe if this takes off in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,596662,597964,you guys can get it too.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,597964,599265,"Whatever the hell that thing is,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,599265,602802,100% plant-based red bean pat -- ugh.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,602802,604937,That will never touch American shores.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,605771,607707,That can stay in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,607707,611043,"No one's going to Popeyes for vegetarian, vegan anything."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,611043,613245,It's a fried-chicken place. So no.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,613245,615681,"Now, we have two sides that are exclusive to the US."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,615681,617183,Red beans and rice.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,617183,618084,Grr!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,618084,621519,"Oh, do we got a bad boy? A thingy-thing?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,621520,624123,Did they not give us any silverware?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,624123,627393,"Mystery spoon from somewhere in the office, all right."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,627393,630129,"Red beans and rice, there it is."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,630129,632598,And coleslaw.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,632598,634300,"We just have the one exclusive side in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,634300,635167,and it's onion rings.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,635167,636402,"These are battered using buttermilk,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,636402,637703,similarly to the chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,637703,639939,"Unfortunately, we weren't able to get these today either."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,639939,641741,"I got a bunch of sauces in front of me,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,641741,644110,and you know what that means! It's:
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,644110,645745,Sauce Talk.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,645745,648648,We've got a tartar sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,648648,651517,The Creole cocktail sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,651517,655621,Creole is a type of cuisine in Louisiana.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,655621,657722,Blackened ranch.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,657723,659091,"Was this supposed to be for the blackened chicken,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,659091,659959,do you think?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,659959,662761,And of course we have regular buttermilk ranch.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,662762,664563,"Well, we already know what ranch is."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,666198,667199,Ranchy.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,667199,668433,Blackened ranch.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,670703,672171,"Oh, that's way better."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,672171,673873,The sweet heat.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,673873,675274,"Had this earlier with the tenders,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,675274,677308,"can confirm, fantastic sauce."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,677309,679445,Wild honey mustard
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,679445,682682,and the bayou Buffalo sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,682682,685317,"In the UK, we have the following exclusive sauces:"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,685317,687520,"we have this voodoo sweet chili sauce,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,687520,690423,which could be quite similar to the US's sweet heat sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,690423,692258,Then we have a garlic mayo
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,692258,693959,"as well as a mango habanero sauce,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,693959,695127,which sounds really good.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,695127,695961,"It's not an exclusive,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,695961,697363,"but shout-out to the Mardi Gras mustard,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,697363,699131,because this stuff slaps.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,702368,703636,"Now, it's not exactly an exclusive,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,703636,704602,but it's worth a shout-out.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,704603,707039,Musician Megan Thee Stallion
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,707039,709008,recently launched a collab with Popeyes
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,709008,710543,and released the Hottie Sauce.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,710543,712078,You can get it as a side for dip
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,712078,713579,or pre-add it to your chicken sandwich.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,713579,714412,"Or if you're in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,714413,716182,you can dip a hot wing into the Hottie Sauce
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,716182,717349,and have a hot wing summer.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,718217,720586,"She's also becoming a Popeyes franchisee,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,720586,723154,as she is opening her own Popeyes soon.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,723155,725057,"And then underneath this, it says,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,725057,728661,"""Need some 'WAP' content here, open to ideas."""
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,728661,731097,"I'm assuming she is the one who did the song ""WAP""?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,731097,732164,I don't know who this person is.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,732164,733966,"I've never heard ""WAP."""
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,733966,736035,I just know it as a reference on the internet.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,737737,740573,And I am going to bask in the glory
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,740573,742007,"that only some my age can,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,742007,745311,of not having any idea what a popular thing is.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,745311,746412,Ah.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,746412,747646,Desserts!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,747646,751117,This is a cinnamon apple pie.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,754920,757222,"Oh, my God [mumbles]."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,757223,758023,What?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,758023,759158,And ...
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,759158,759992,ugh!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,762094,764363,Chocolate chip cookies.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,764363,766198,"Was she with Paul Davis,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,766198,767867,Pete Davidson for awhile? Was that the one?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,769301,770936,"We have an exclusive dessert option of our own,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,770936,772204,which is ice cream sundaes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,772204,774406,"Now, these are available in the following flavors:"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,774406,777676,"vanilla, chocolate, caramel,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,777676,780079,"with Oreos, or with Lotus Biscoff."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,780079,781446,You can also pay an extra 50 pence
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,781447,783149,to add little pieces of Oreo or Biscoff
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,783149,784316,to any of these sundaes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,784316,785451,"If you've watched ""Food Wars"" for long enough,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,785451,787319,"you'll know that I really don't like Biscoff,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,787319,788853,"and I know that's a very controversial opinion,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,788854,790856,"so don't send for me, please."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,790856,792925,"All right, so before you saw those big gallons of tea."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,792925,795961,There was sweet tea and unsweetened tea. Very nice.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,795961,798597,We also have a premium lemonade. That's this right here.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,798597,801167,I've been sipping on because this chicken is getting to me.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,802101,804270,"They also have premium strawberry lemonade,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,804270,807840,"and they also have this right here, Hawaiian Punch."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,807840,809341,You guys don't know what Hawaiian Punch is?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,809341,811443,It is fruit punch.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,813913,816348,"Oh, yeah, all the good stuff's at the bottom."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,816348,819451,"And ginger ale. Ugh, I have a headache all of a sudden."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,819451,821053,"We have a range of exclusive drinks in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,821053,822755,some of which are hot and some of which are cold.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,822755,823756,We'll start with the hot drinks.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,823756,825123,It wouldn't be a British fast-food menu
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,825124,826592,unless you could get a cup of tea.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,826592,827893,"Then we have a range of hot coffees,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,827893,830563,"including a cappuccino, an Americano,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,830563,832131,"a flat white, and a latte."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,832131,833032,"Then we're on to the cold drinks,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,833032,834133,"including some bottled options,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,834133,835668,"like this Oasis summer fruits,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,835668,838871,"this sparkling water, and this orange Capri Sun."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,838871,839904,Of all the linguistic differences
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,839905,840940,"between the States and the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,840940,842508,this might be the one that annoys me the most.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,842508,845544,We pronounce this CAP-ri Sun. You pronounce it Cap-RI Sun.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,845544,846378,You're putting the emphasis
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,846378,848881,on the completely wrong part of the word. Get it right.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,848881,850049,"In the UK, you can also get a range"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,850049,851183,"of hand-spun milkshakes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,851183,852885,which unfortunately we couldn't get today.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,852885,853719,"When they are available,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,853719,855421,you can get them in similar flavors to the sundaes.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,855421,858791,"They come as Biscoff, Oreo, vanilla, chocolate,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,858791,860392,"caramel, or also strawberry."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,860392,861227,"And just like the sundaes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,861227,862461,you can pay an additional 50 pence
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,862461,864597,for an additional Biscoff or Oreo topping.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,867366,868934,The chicken sandwich from a UK Popeyes
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,868934,870069,contains the following.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,871370,873404,"If you get the chicken sandwich at a US Popeyes,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,873405,875407,it contains this.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,875407,876342,What if you made it a meal?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,876342,879477,"You add the regular serving of Popeyes Cajun fries,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,879478,881513,you'll be adding the following.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,881513,883883,A side of fries in the UK contains the following.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,886051,887353,Poof!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,887353,889088,"Add this medium Coke to the mix,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,889088,891390,"and you're adding 368 calories,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,891390,893726,"99 carbs, all of those are sugar,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,893726,895895,and 88 milligrams of sodium.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,895895,899198,"And a regular Coke in the UK adds 180 calories,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,899198,901300,"zero grams of fat or saturated fat,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,901300,904036,"45.6 grams of carbs, all of which are sugars,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,904036,905337,and zero sodium.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,905337,907272,And what is the total of this US meal?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,907273,910643,"1,335 calories,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,910643,912578,"56 grams of total fat,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,912578,914914,"19 of those grams are saturated fat,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,914914,917216,"182 grams of carbs,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,917216,919952,"106.5 of those grams of sugar,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,919952,923722,"and 2,118 milligrams of sodium."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,923722,925424,Yo.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,925424,926592,The UK total:
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,926592,927959,"1,300 calories,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,927960,929495,"63.7 grams of fat,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,929495,931630,"of which 20.4 grams of saturated,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,931630,933699,"135.4 grams of carbs,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,933699,935834,"of which 54.8 grams are sugars,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,935834,938503,"and 1,160 milligrams of sodium."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,938504,940506,"Obviously the sugar stats here look bad,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,940506,941774,"but in Popeyes' defense,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,941774,943742,a majority of the sugar is coming from
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,943742,946045,this 30 ounces -- [chuckles] 30 ounces --
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,946045,947011,of Coca-Cola.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,947012,948914,"Now, if you got a sugar-free soda instead,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,948914,950349,it would be a much lower figure.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,950349,952151,"The meal does contain, however,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,952151,955054,95% of your daily saturated fat
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,955054,958357,as well as 92% of your daily sodium.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,958357,959792,"Perhaps surprisingly, it seems as if"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,959792,961493,the fat and saturated fat totals
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,961493,963795,are actually higher in the UK than they are in the US.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,963796,965631,This meal would take you just over 100%
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,965631,967766,of your daily saturated fat allowance.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,967766,970536,"However, the sodium content is way higher here"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,970536,971704,than it is in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,971704,973605,The biggest difference comes in the chicken sandwich.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,973605,975907,"This guy right here, for some reason,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,975908,980713,has 260% more sodium than that in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,983983,986118,"Unfortunately, Popeyes has not disclosed"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,986118,989287,"a full ingredients list in the US, only allergens."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,989288,990589,It's a similar deal in the UK.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,990589,992458,"Popeyes doesn't disclose a full ingredients list,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,992458,993425,just allergens.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,993425,995627,The only sort of surprising thing we found out in the US
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,995627,998530,is that there is fish present in the beans and rice.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,998530,1001300,But what else do we know about the Popeyes food?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1001300,1002134,Ah!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1002134,1003701,"Well, for one, on the website,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1003702,1006238,there is a list of a slightly vague commitment
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1006238,1008707,"to removing all artificial colors, flavors,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1008707,1010409,and preservatives from their fried chicken
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1010409,1012244,by the end of 2022.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1012244,1014646,"So, that's this year, guys. Better get on it."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1014646,1015748,"Also by the end of this year,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1015748,1019118,they want to remove all MSG from their chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1019118,1020618,"Now, correct me if I'm wrong,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1020619,1021820,but that implies they currently
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1021820,1023922,are using MSG on the chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1023922,1026191,But how much and to which chicken dishes
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1026191,1027659,"they're actually adding MSG,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1027659,1029328,they have not specified.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1029328,1031430,They also want to use only cage-free eggs
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1031430,1033999,by the end of 2025.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1033999,1035968,"Take your time there, guys, jeez."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1035968,1038470,"Also, cage-free ""eggs""?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1038470,1040072,What about the chickens?
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1040072,1041506,"One interesting thing is that in the UK,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1041506,1043308,"Popeyes has pledged to make all its chicken halal,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1043308,1045209,meaning it's suitable for Muslim people to eat.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1045209,1047880,Popeyes UK also uses Red Tractor-assured chicken.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1047880,1049181,This is a farming standards board

Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1051383,1052418,"To be Red Tractor-assured,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1052418,1054520,you can't do things like wash your chicken in chlorine
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1054520,1056088,"or use antibiotics on your chicken,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1056088,1059024,unless it's approved by a vet to treat a specific illness.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1059024,1061160,"Red Tractor doesn't exist in the US,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1061160,1063262,but Popeyes does say it uses chicken
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1063262,1066098,free from added hormones and steroids.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1066098,1067900,There's a commitment on Popeyes' website
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1067900,1070169,to removing antibiotics from its chickens
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1070169,1071570,by the end of 2021.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1071570,1072638,So that's right around the corner
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1072638,1073705,"at the time of recording this,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1073705,1076174,"and we reached out to them for what was going on,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1076175,1078710,"and they told us X, [laughs]"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1078710,1081046,which is code for nothing.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1081046,1082714,Red Tractor certification also means
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1082714,1084817,"that chickens must be kept in a safe, comfortable,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1084817,1086952,"hygienic, and sufficiently sized housing;"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1086952,1088654,"given a full, healthy diet;"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1088654,1091090,and have permanent access to environmental enrichment
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1091090,1092658,that is suitable for their needs.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1092658,1094626,"Again, we do not have Red Tractor in the US,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1094626,1096728,"but Popeyes claims it wants to, quote,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1096728,1098864,"""promote practices that support"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1098864,1101066,and address the globally recognized
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1101066,1104203,"five freedoms of animal welfare,"" end quote."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1104203,1106271,These principles broadly line up
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1106271,1109241,"with the Red Tractor guarantees, which are:"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1109241,1110908,"freedom from hunger and thirst,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1110909,1112511,"freedom from discomfort,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1112511,1114413,"freedom from pain, injury, and disease,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1114413,1116747,"freedom to express normal, natural behaviors,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1116748,1119551,"like accommodating for chickens' instinct to roost,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1119551,1122187,and freedom from fear and distress.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1122187,1124256,I don't even get those freedoms!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1124256,1125390,I'm terrified all the time!
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1125390,1126225,[chicken clucks]
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1126225,1128927,"So it looks like they're aiming for equivalent standards,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1128927,1132030,even if they don't have a nice Red Tractor badge
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1132030,1134266,or whatever to prove that they've achieved it.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1134266,1136802,"Now, obviously Popeyes is a Louisiana fast-food chain."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1136802,1138737,Joe asked me to try and find Louisiana on a map.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1138737,1140205,I don't know much about American geography.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1140205,1142741,"I can tell you where California is,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1142741,1145777,"where Texas is, where Florida is."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1145777,1147880,"New York is somewhere over here, I think."
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1148881,1151817,"If I had to hazard a guess as to where Louisiana was,"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1151817,1153252,"I mean, it's the South, right?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1153252,1154252,It's the South.
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1154253,1155354,Maybe ...
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1156622,1158757,"is it, like, this one?"
Z9RD_wPDlpQ,1158757,1160225,Maybe that one there.
