0iNyfKxfFVM,72880,75280,the link down below but back to today's
0iNyfKxfFVM,75280,78080,video today's video is a
0iNyfKxfFVM,78080,79920,roundup of
0iNyfKxfFVM,79920,82479,all the most commonly seen styling
0iNyfKxfFVM,82479,85920,mistakes that i see amongst my clients
0iNyfKxfFVM,85920,87920,which generally speaking is probably an
0iNyfKxfFVM,87920,91600,age group of anything from 35
0iNyfKxfFVM,91600,95119,onwards and it's often things like
0iNyfKxfFVM,95119,97520,them looking to
0iNyfKxfFVM,97520,100079,maybe too frumpy they haven't quite
0iNyfKxfFVM,100079,102079,moved with the times a little bit so
0iNyfKxfFVM,102079,104240,they might be wearing a white shirt and
0iNyfKxfFVM,104240,106479,jeans for example but they've put it
0iNyfKxfFVM,106479,108079,with the wrong shoe maybe they're
0iNyfKxfFVM,108079,111119,putting it with a like a workout trainer
0iNyfKxfFVM,111119,114399,or sneaker for you guys in america or
0iNyfKxfFVM,114399,115600,they're just not putting the right
0iNyfKxfFVM,115600,118320,combinations together so today's video i
0iNyfKxfFVM,118320,120880,kind of accumulated them all together
0iNyfKxfFVM,120880,122880,and i'm going to show you sort of the
0iNyfKxfFVM,122880,125040,before and the after of what they are
0iNyfKxfFVM,125040,126880,doing wrong and how i go about
0iNyfKxfFVM,126880,129599,rectifying that for them now these are
0iNyfKxfFVM,129599,132800,only my personal opinions so if you are
0iNyfKxfFVM,132800,135440,doing something and you feel confident
0iNyfKxfFVM,135440,137360,doing that thing then
0iNyfKxfFVM,137360,140319,crack on do not worry about what i say
0iNyfKxfFVM,140319,142480,because please do remember it is
0iNyfKxfFVM,142480,144720,personal styling
0iNyfKxfFVM,144720,146480,it's personal for a reason it's personal
0iNyfKxfFVM,146480,148640,to you it's personal to your lifestyle
0iNyfKxfFVM,148640,151760,it's personal to your body shape as well
0iNyfKxfFVM,151760,152800,so
0iNyfKxfFVM,152800,154959,just ignore it if you don't like what
0iNyfKxfFVM,154959,157120,i've got to say and just fast forward
0iNyfKxfFVM,157120,159120,onto the next one okay
0iNyfKxfFVM,159120,161519,so as always if you could press that
0iNyfKxfFVM,161519,163599,subscribe button i would be very
0iNyfKxfFVM,163599,165680,grateful the more subscribers i'm
0iNyfKxfFVM,165680,168000,getting then the more content i can
0iNyfKxfFVM,168000,170160,bring you decided to do a voice over as
0iNyfKxfFVM,170160,172640,there was too much content to speak at
0iNyfKxfFVM,172640,175120,the same time i also wanted to quickly
0iNyfKxfFVM,175120,177120,say that the uk links for all the
0iNyfKxfFVM,177120,179360,clothes are under the description box
0iNyfKxfFVM,179360,182159,under where the video plays the american
0iNyfKxfFVM,182159,184800,links however are saved somewhere new
0iNyfKxfFVM,184800,187040,they are saved in the comments section
0iNyfKxfFVM,187040,190000,and will remain as the first comment
0iNyfKxfFVM,190000,193280,when you open the comments up
0iNyfKxfFVM,193280,195519,so we're starting off with three major
0iNyfKxfFVM,195519,198080,fashion mistakes firstly the shirt is
0iNyfKxfFVM,198080,201599,far too tight it's dated it looks washed
0iNyfKxfFVM,201599,204720,out secondly the trousers again are very
0iNyfKxfFVM,204720,207200,dated they're cutting me at my widest
0iNyfKxfFVM,207200,210000,point and the shoes are far too dark for
0iNyfKxfFVM,210000,212879,a summer outfit as well as being round
0iNyfKxfFVM,212879,215040,toed which is going to make my legs look
0iNyfKxfFVM,215040,217680,a lot shorter we could try and tuck the
0iNyfKxfFVM,217680,219680,shirt in which will help lengthen the
0iNyfKxfFVM,219680,222159,leg length but this is what people do
0iNyfKxfFVM,222159,224640,they pick a shirt or a top that is too
0iNyfKxfFVM,224640,227280,tight to try and tuck in and you just
0iNyfKxfFVM,227280,230239,don't get that relaxed modern feel with
0iNyfKxfFVM,230239,231040,it
0iNyfKxfFVM,231040,234319,all in all a really really bad look this
0iNyfKxfFVM,234319,236560,is often made worse when people pair
0iNyfKxfFVM,236560,239040,this type of outfit with a running
0iNyfKxfFVM,239040,241599,trainer or sneaker
0iNyfKxfFVM,241599,244640,again it's just very very dated doesn't
0iNyfKxfFVM,244640,247120,do anything for my figure i keep trying
0iNyfKxfFVM,247120,248879,to pull my sleeves up but even that
0iNyfKxfFVM,248879,251439,isn't going to help this one
0iNyfKxfFVM,251439,253200,so the first thing i've done is change
0iNyfKxfFVM,253200,255920,the shirt to a white linen slightly more
0iNyfKxfFVM,255920,259280,oversized look i've also put some cream
0iNyfKxfFVM,259280,262000,colored sliders on just an attempt to
0iNyfKxfFVM,262000,264720,make it look a lot more tonal and not so
0iNyfKxfFVM,264720,266960,heavy with a dark shoe on the bottom but
0iNyfKxfFVM,266960,268720,to be honest these trousers they're just
0iNyfKxfFVM,268720,270639,not good length on me and they're
0iNyfKxfFVM,270639,273120,naturally not a very good length on most
0iNyfKxfFVM,273120,275759,people instead i'd go for something like
0iNyfKxfFVM,275759,278720,this or these white trousers from the
0iNyfKxfFVM,278720,281520,white company both of these styles
0iNyfKxfFVM,281520,284160,cuts me on my ankles and will make my
0iNyfKxfFVM,284160,286400,legs look thinner
0iNyfKxfFVM,286400,288800,now personally i would rather go for
0iNyfKxfFVM,288800,291280,something like this which is a
0iNyfKxfFVM,291280,294080,beige kick to flare jean i think they
0iNyfKxfFVM,294080,296880,were from mango they are listed in the
0iNyfKxfFVM,296880,299759,description box and in the comments box
0iNyfKxfFVM,299759,302160,and if we compare both of the pictures
0iNyfKxfFVM,302160,304160,then i think you'll agree that the one
0iNyfKxfFVM,304160,305919,on the right is a lot more modern
0iNyfKxfFVM,305919,307520,especially when we team it with
0iNyfKxfFVM,307520,310400,accessories like a big straw bag which
0iNyfKxfFVM,310400,312560,is always going to make an outfit look
0iNyfKxfFVM,312560,314960,slightly more modern there are lots of
0iNyfKxfFVM,314960,317039,variations of these i know some of you
0iNyfKxfFVM,317039,319199,will say you don't want to be in a jean
0iNyfKxfFVM,319199,321759,so you can change the jeans up for a
0iNyfKxfFVM,321759,323680,linen pair of trousers but just make
0iNyfKxfFVM,323680,325199,sure that they're cutting you at your
0iNyfKxfFVM,325199,327759,smallest part and not your widest part
0iNyfKxfFVM,327759,330479,along your calves i've actually linked a
0iNyfKxfFVM,330479,333199,number of linen pairs of trousers in the
0iNyfKxfFVM,333199,336000,description box for both the uk and
0iNyfKxfFVM,336000,338560,america so take a look at those as an
0iNyfKxfFVM,338560,341360,alternative to the linen i like wearing
0iNyfKxfFVM,341360,345199,a wide leg satiny type of trouser
0iNyfKxfFVM,345199,347520,they're very popular at the moment
0iNyfKxfFVM,347520,349919,there's a number of them in zara as well
0iNyfKxfFVM,349919,352240,as many other places again i have linked
0iNyfKxfFVM,352240,355120,them but it's really easy to create a
0iNyfKxfFVM,355120,359120,very relaxed yet stylish look by just
0iNyfKxfFVM,359120,361759,pairing a couple of nice accessories the
0iNyfKxfFVM,361759,363759,longer length is certainly making my
0iNyfKxfFVM,363759,367600,legs look a lot longer than compared to
0iNyfKxfFVM,367600,369600,the first pair of trousers with the
0iNyfKxfFVM,369600,372319,darker shoes on and this type of trouser
0iNyfKxfFVM,372319,374560,is really easily elevated into the
0iNyfKxfFVM,374560,377039,evening look with maybe just a nice
0iNyfKxfFVM,377039,379759,small little heel or a little loafer or
0iNyfKxfFVM,379759,381520,something similar to that
0iNyfKxfFVM,381520,383199,so sticking with the mistakes people
0iNyfKxfFVM,383199,385520,make with the length of their trousers
0iNyfKxfFVM,385520,387600,when placed with these heels these green
0iNyfKxfFVM,387600,390400,trousers are the perfect length the new
0iNyfKxfFVM,390400,393039,chews help to elongate my legs even
0iNyfKxfFVM,393039,396080,further as the mule effect which crosses
0iNyfKxfFVM,396080,399120,the very front of my shirt my foot
0iNyfKxfFVM,399120,401919,effectively gives me an extra 15
0iNyfKxfFVM,401919,404880,centimeters on my leg length but what
0iNyfKxfFVM,404880,407440,happens when i put them with a flat
0iNyfKxfFVM,407440,410000,especially a flat like a loafer that is
0iNyfKxfFVM,410000,412000,coming up further
0iNyfKxfFVM,412000,414639,coming further up at the bridge of my
0iNyfKxfFVM,414639,417360,foot as you can see they're no longer as
0iNyfKxfFVM,417360,419520,flattering so the first thing i need to
0iNyfKxfFVM,419520,422319,do is show more of my ankle so i'm
0iNyfKxfFVM,422319,425280,regaining that leg length back so i do
0iNyfKxfFVM,425280,428319,that simply by turning them under and if
0iNyfKxfFVM,428319,431199,i know that my lifestyle dictates that i
0iNyfKxfFVM,431199,434080,wear flats with these trousers more than
0iNyfKxfFVM,434080,436160,i do heels then i would take them up
0iNyfKxfFVM,436160,438080,permanently perhaps using a bit of
0iNyfKxfFVM,438080,441599,wonder web or something on those lines
0iNyfKxfFVM,441599,443599,so i've tried to keep the styling very
0iNyfKxfFVM,443599,446400,simple here so that you can focus on the
0iNyfKxfFVM,446400,449360,next biggest common mistake that i see
0iNyfKxfFVM,449360,451680,and that's the introduction of dark
0iNyfKxfFVM,451680,455039,shoes with a spring or summer outfit
0iNyfKxfFVM,455039,457199,as you can see with the shoe on the
0iNyfKxfFVM,457199,460479,right the straps are making my legs look
0iNyfKxfFVM,460479,464240,a lot shorter and also the dark nature
0iNyfKxfFVM,464240,466479,of the shoe just throws off the balance
0iNyfKxfFVM,466479,468800,of the entire outfit
0iNyfKxfFVM,468800,471440,we can improve this slightly by choosing
0iNyfKxfFVM,471440,474639,a darker shoe that still exposes more of
0iNyfKxfFVM,474639,477280,the foot so we'll make our legs look
0iNyfKxfFVM,477280,480560,longer but i think against the new chew
0iNyfKxfFVM,480560,483360,it's still too dark and heavy
0iNyfKxfFVM,483360,485680,and if you're not a fan of the nude shoe
0iNyfKxfFVM,485680,488160,then maybe choose like a brown shoe like
0iNyfKxfFVM,488160,491440,i've chosen here now when i combine the
0iNyfKxfFVM,491440,494160,brown shoe with the bag that also has a
0iNyfKxfFVM,494160,496639,darker color in then that seems to
0iNyfKxfFVM,496639,498800,balance out the outfit a little bit
0iNyfKxfFVM,498800,501520,better but for me personally i like to
0iNyfKxfFVM,501520,503840,keep things tonal i think the overall
0iNyfKxfFVM,503840,506879,look is really fresh and i've teamed it
0iNyfKxfFVM,506879,509360,here with some beige loafers as you can
0iNyfKxfFVM,509360,511440,see and this anime
0iNyfKxfFVM,511440,514640,bag and together i feel like it creates
0iNyfKxfFVM,514640,518159,timeless classic and sophisticated look
0iNyfKxfFVM,518159,520640,and when you keep the base layers
0iNyfKxfFVM,520640,522800,neutral like i've done here there's
0iNyfKxfFVM,522800,525279,nothing stopping you adding that pop of
0iNyfKxfFVM,525279,527920,color in to brighten up the outfit
0iNyfKxfFVM,527920,530399,just don't do it in combination with a
0iNyfKxfFVM,530399,532320,dark shoe
0iNyfKxfFVM,532320,534399,or instead of a handbag you could change
0iNyfKxfFVM,534399,536720,the shirt color for this lovely striped
0iNyfKxfFVM,536720,539600,shirt from mango
0iNyfKxfFVM,539600,543040,so the next mistake is above the knee
0iNyfKxfFVM,543040,546480,tight denim shorts despite making a bit
0iNyfKxfFVM,546480,548560,of a fashion come back they are an
0iNyfKxfFVM,548560,551440,incredibly hard look to pull off you
0iNyfKxfFVM,551440,553040,really do need
0iNyfKxfFVM,553040,556480,very long slender legs and
0iNyfKxfFVM,556480,558640,and then wear them with the right
0iNyfKxfFVM,558640,560959,combination of top
0iNyfKxfFVM,560959,563120,to make this look work
0iNyfKxfFVM,563120,565600,but here paired with the old-fashioned
0iNyfKxfFVM,565600,568959,shirt and the trainers then it really
0iNyfKxfFVM,568959,570480,isn't a good look
0iNyfKxfFVM,570480,573360,so i started just by pulling the one leg
0iNyfKxfFVM,573360,576080,length up and you could probably see
0iNyfKxfFVM,576080,578640,that my legs actually look better with
0iNyfKxfFVM,578640,581279,them being shorter rather than longer it
0iNyfKxfFVM,581279,584000,actually makes my legs look longer
0iNyfKxfFVM,584000,586320,however it's still not a look that i
0iNyfKxfFVM,586320,589680,personally like and especially so when
0iNyfKxfFVM,589680,591920,people wear denim shorts that are really
0iNyfKxfFVM,591920,594240,tight against the legs
0iNyfKxfFVM,594240,596320,that is going to make your legs look
0iNyfKxfFVM,596320,599920,rather chunky and not so slender
0iNyfKxfFVM,599920,602079,instead what you should be looking for
0iNyfKxfFVM,602079,605440,is a short that has some volume around
0iNyfKxfFVM,605440,608000,the leg so the leg actually looks
0iNyfKxfFVM,608000,610880,slimmer because you've got more volume
0iNyfKxfFVM,610880,613519,but here i'm pulling them back tighter
0iNyfKxfFVM,613519,616240,and my legs look slightly chunkier
0iNyfKxfFVM,616240,617120,so
0iNyfKxfFVM,617120,619440,i like pairing them with a cohort set as
0iNyfKxfFVM,619440,621279,you can see here
0iNyfKxfFVM,621279,622320,and
0iNyfKxfFVM,622320,623920,teamed with some really lovely
0iNyfKxfFVM,623920,626640,accessories the majority of these are
0iNyfKxfFVM,626640,630399,from monica bernarda of which i do have
0iNyfKxfFVM,630399,632880,a discount code but it's only available
0iNyfKxfFVM,632880,635760,until the 3rd of may 22. so if you're
0iNyfKxfFVM,635760,638000,watching this video from a while ago
0iNyfKxfFVM,638000,641440,then it may not be available but all of
0iNyfKxfFVM,641440,644560,the added accessories here the belt from
0iNyfKxfFVM,644560,648560,zara the handbag all helps to break up
0iNyfKxfFVM,648560,652240,this coordinated outfit but also it
0iNyfKxfFVM,652240,655279,brings together the coordinated outfit
0iNyfKxfFVM,655279,658720,to create a lot more of a stylish look
0iNyfKxfFVM,658720,661120,now i appreciate that some of you won't
0iNyfKxfFVM,661120,663200,want that sort of silky look it might be
0iNyfKxfFVM,663200,664000,too
0iNyfKxfFVM,664000,668000,um styled for you and here is a set from
0iNyfKxfFVM,668000,671440,arquette it's a linen coord set and then
0iNyfKxfFVM,671440,674160,there's another wrinkled cotton set here
0iNyfKxfFVM,674160,676480,i've linked all of these sets and
0iNyfKxfFVM,676480,678800,they're all beautiful and a lot more of
0iNyfKxfFVM,678800,681600,a modern way to wear a short and shirt
0iNyfKxfFVM,681600,684480,combination so if we compare the two
0iNyfKxfFVM,684480,686959,here hopefully you can see that the one
0iNyfKxfFVM,686959,690240,on the left is nowhere near as stylish
0iNyfKxfFVM,690240,692000,but again i appreciate that a lot of you
0iNyfKxfFVM,692000,694959,won't want to show your legs at all so i
0iNyfKxfFVM,694959,697680,have found some really nice linen
0iNyfKxfFVM,697680,700560,jumpsuits which will recreate the look
0iNyfKxfFVM,700560,703040,but without obviously showing your legs
0iNyfKxfFVM,703040,705360,so that's also an option i particularly
0iNyfKxfFVM,705360,708000,like this one from mango
0iNyfKxfFVM,708000,710560,so i have counted no less than five
0iNyfKxfFVM,710560,712320,styling mistakes with this outfit
0iNyfKxfFVM,712320,714880,combination number one we've got a very
0iNyfKxfFVM,714880,718079,dated top secondly the cap sleeves on
0iNyfKxfFVM,718079,720160,the top are too tight and they're making
0iNyfKxfFVM,720160,722320,my arms look a lot bigger
0iNyfKxfFVM,722320,724800,thirdly we are pairing a dressier top
0iNyfKxfFVM,724800,726880,with a dark running shoe
0iNyfKxfFVM,726880,729920,this sometimes works if you've got a
0iNyfKxfFVM,729920,732480,more casual white trainer and a more
0iNyfKxfFVM,732480,734720,going out top that's actually a very
0iNyfKxfFVM,734720,737279,nice combination but not with a dated
0iNyfKxfFVM,737279,739600,pair of trainers next on the right hand
0iNyfKxfFVM,739600,741360,side you'll see that we've paired it
0iNyfKxfFVM,741360,745040,with a dark round toed flat shoe this is
0iNyfKxfFVM,745040,746079,going to
0iNyfKxfFVM,746079,749519,shorten my leg length quite considerably
0iNyfKxfFVM,749519,752160,and finally the actual leg length of the
0iNyfKxfFVM,752160,754480,jeans is neither here nor there it
0iNyfKxfFVM,754480,757680,either needs to be ankle grazing or it
0iNyfKxfFVM,757680,760320,needs to be longer in the leg
0iNyfKxfFVM,760320,763360,so here i've chosen a longer leg in a
0iNyfKxfFVM,763360,765279,pair of jeans but i've kept the styling
0iNyfKxfFVM,765279,768000,really simple with this white top and
0iNyfKxfFVM,768000,770639,i'm using accessories to
0iNyfKxfFVM,770639,772639,brighten and make the outfit more
0iNyfKxfFVM,772639,775200,interesting now i've paired them with a
0iNyfKxfFVM,775200,778560,very small heeled mule and the important
0iNyfKxfFVM,778560,782240,bit here is that my mule heel and my
0iNyfKxfFVM,782240,785839,trainer platform are the same or very
0iNyfKxfFVM,785839,789600,similar in height that enables me to
0iNyfKxfFVM,789600,792079,still wear my longer jeans with a
0iNyfKxfFVM,792079,795760,trainer for a lot more of a casual look
0iNyfKxfFVM,795760,798320,now the common theme across all of these
0iNyfKxfFVM,798320,800480,styling mistakes is the choice of the
0iNyfKxfFVM,800480,803839,wrong shoes and the wrong trouser length
0iNyfKxfFVM,803839,806000,so on purpose i have put these less
0iNyfKxfFVM,806000,808160,flattering jeans on they're lighter in
0iNyfKxfFVM,808160,810320,color so straight away they're not going
0iNyfKxfFVM,810320,812560,to be as flattering on my legs
0iNyfKxfFVM,812560,815040,and the shoes are coming all the way up
0iNyfKxfFVM,815040,816880,the front of my foot so it's not
0iNyfKxfFVM,816880,819199,allowing me to show any foot and gain
0iNyfKxfFVM,819199,821680,any extra length at all
0iNyfKxfFVM,821680,824720,now changing this look up is very very
0iNyfKxfFVM,824720,826000,simple
0iNyfKxfFVM,826000,827760,firstly we've changed the top for just a
0iNyfKxfFVM,827760,830560,little prettier top and we have paired
0iNyfKxfFVM,830560,834079,it with the cream colored sliders from
0iNyfKxfFVM,834079,837040,new look and added a bag we haven't kept
0iNyfKxfFVM,837040,839120,those heavy trainers on because we don't
0iNyfKxfFVM,839120,841680,want to mix the nice top with their big
0iNyfKxfFVM,841680,844079,heavy trainers we also don't like the
0iNyfKxfFVM,844079,846480,look of the dark shoes in this spring
0iNyfKxfFVM,846480,848560,look it's going to shorten my leg length
0iNyfKxfFVM,848560,850240,even further
0iNyfKxfFVM,850240,852480,now this look can really easily be
0iNyfKxfFVM,852480,855680,elevated by adding the mules and when we
0iNyfKxfFVM,855680,858079,do we benefit from the heel height which
0iNyfKxfFVM,858079,860399,makes the lighter colored jeans work
0iNyfKxfFVM,860399,863120,better on my frame because my whole leg
0iNyfKxfFVM,863120,865600,length is elevated now to try and
0iNyfKxfFVM,865600,867279,distract a little bit from the legs
0iNyfKxfFVM,867279,869120,we've put a pop of color at the side
0iNyfKxfFVM,869120,871839,with the orange handbag and now i'm
0iNyfKxfFVM,871839,874720,ready for a nice evening out
0iNyfKxfFVM,874720,876880,so moving on to the styling mistakes
0iNyfKxfFVM,876880,879279,that i see with skirts for anybody in
0iNyfKxfFVM,879279,881600,the uk you'll recognize this as a white
0iNyfKxfFVM,881600,885120,stuff fat face 90s skirt the leg length
0iNyfKxfFVM,885120,887839,is particularly bad on my shaped legs
0iNyfKxfFVM,887839,890880,because i've got very shapely calves and
0iNyfKxfFVM,890880,893600,again it's cutting up cutting me at one
0iNyfKxfFVM,893600,896240,of my widest points so generally
0iNyfKxfFVM,896240,898320,speaking this is an incredibly dated
0iNyfKxfFVM,898320,900079,look even when i've paired it with a
0iNyfKxfFVM,900079,902399,plain white t-shirt and some modern
0iNyfKxfFVM,902399,903680,trainers
0iNyfKxfFVM,903680,906560,instead i would swap that skirt for a
0iNyfKxfFVM,906560,909839,longer skirt in this case a pleated one
0iNyfKxfFVM,909839,912720,you could swap the pleated skirt for a
0iNyfKxfFVM,912720,915360,slip skirt but please do be aware that
0iNyfKxfFVM,915360,918480,slip skirts are incredibly difficult to
0iNyfKxfFVM,918480,921519,wear if you've got any sort of lumps and
0iNyfKxfFVM,921519,924079,bumps where the pleated skirt especially
0iNyfKxfFVM,924079,926000,a patterned pleated skirt is a lot more
0iNyfKxfFVM,926000,927120,forgiving
0iNyfKxfFVM,927120,929120,as you can see i've teamed it here with
0iNyfKxfFVM,929120,931360,a leather jacket and i've linked some
0iNyfKxfFVM,931360,934560,fantastic leather jackets from amazon in
0iNyfKxfFVM,934560,936639,the description box and the comment box
0iNyfKxfFVM,936639,939040,for the american links but here i've
0iNyfKxfFVM,939040,941279,changed it up by adding a really nice
0iNyfKxfFVM,941279,943120,white blazer it gives it a bit of a
0iNyfKxfFVM,943120,945600,softer look but i've still kept the
0iNyfKxfFVM,945600,948240,white espra drills on just to keep it
0iNyfKxfFVM,948240,951839,modern and more relaxed but despite the
0iNyfKxfFVM,951839,954320,modern combinations of the espera girls
0iNyfKxfFVM,954320,956720,and the blazer it doesn't work with the
0iNyfKxfFVM,956720,960320,old-fashioned skirt it makes for a very
0iNyfKxfFVM,960320,965040,frumpy look rather than a stylish look
0iNyfKxfFVM,965040,967360,next is the styling mistakes that i see
0iNyfKxfFVM,967360,970399,when people wear wide leg trousers as
0iNyfKxfFVM,970399,973279,you can see here wide leg trousers only
0iNyfKxfFVM,973279,976240,work when you can show the waistband as
0iNyfKxfFVM,976240,978480,soon as the top is pulled out i look
0iNyfKxfFVM,978480,980880,very straight up and straight down very
0iNyfKxfFVM,980880,983839,block-like if your figure is such that
0iNyfKxfFVM,983839,986639,you can't show any waistband then quite
0iNyfKxfFVM,986639,989519,frankly i would probably avoid a wide
0iNyfKxfFVM,989519,991920,leg in trouser unless you were going to
0iNyfKxfFVM,991920,994639,wear a really tight top with it
0iNyfKxfFVM,994639,997199,the top doesn't need to go in by much
0iNyfKxfFVM,997199,999519,only perhaps a centimeter at the very
0iNyfKxfFVM,999519,1002639,front or you could show the waistband at
0iNyfKxfFVM,1002639,1004959,the side but the waistband definitely
0iNyfKxfFVM,1004959,1006720,needs to be shown it shows the
0iNyfKxfFVM,1006720,1009199,correlation between the wide leg and the
0iNyfKxfFVM,1009199,1011600,smaller waist and that's what makes the
0iNyfKxfFVM,1011600,1014160,wide leg trouser look flattering
0iNyfKxfFVM,1014160,1016720,and the final styling mistake that i see
0iNyfKxfFVM,1016720,1019680,on a continual basis is the lack of
0iNyfKxfFVM,1019680,1021440,accessorizing
0iNyfKxfFVM,1021440,1023839,accessorizing can make our clothes
0iNyfKxfFVM,1023839,1026558,really really versatile take this
0iNyfKxfFVM,1026558,1028720,jumpsuit for example it's a beautiful
0iNyfKxfFVM,1028720,1030640,jumpsuit and to be fair it looks pretty
0iNyfKxfFVM,1030640,1033918,nice on its own anyway but all i do is
0iNyfKxfFVM,1033918,1036959,add some sunglasses a bag and some
0iNyfKxfFVM,1036959,1039438,espadrille trainers and i've completely
0iNyfKxfFVM,1039438,1042000,changed the look up i'm ready now for
0iNyfKxfFVM,1042000,1044000,perhaps a casual day out with my
0iNyfKxfFVM,1044000,1045120,children
0iNyfKxfFVM,1045120,1047360,this jumpsuit was from reese but it was
0iNyfKxfFVM,1047360,1049600,last year so i have found you a number
0iNyfKxfFVM,1049600,1052240,of alternatives which you will find in
0iNyfKxfFVM,1052240,1055120,both the description box for the uk link
0iNyfKxfFVM,1055120,1057760,and the comments box for the american
0iNyfKxfFVM,1057760,1059039,links
0iNyfKxfFVM,1059039,1061520,however we can completely change this
0iNyfKxfFVM,1061520,1064320,look with some really well chosen
0iNyfKxfFVM,1064320,1067520,accessories my necklaces here the
0iNyfKxfFVM,1067520,1071919,bracelets the ring the earrings it all
0iNyfKxfFVM,1071919,1074880,adds to give a completely different look
0iNyfKxfFVM,1074880,1075600,so
0iNyfKxfFVM,1075600,1078799,right now this very daytime jumpsuit is
0iNyfKxfFVM,1078799,1080960,perfect for an evening out i've paired
0iNyfKxfFVM,1080960,1084240,it with the white blazer and a pop of
0iNyfKxfFVM,1084240,1086799,color with the orange mango bag
0iNyfKxfFVM,1086799,1088799,and yeah like i say i've got a
0iNyfKxfFVM,1088799,1091360,completely different outfit and when i
0iNyfKxfFVM,1091360,1093760,go to clients houses it's not uncommon
0iNyfKxfFVM,1093760,1096080,for me to find a lack of accessories
0iNyfKxfFVM,1096080,1098080,there but if you really want to make
0iNyfKxfFVM,1098080,1100720,your wardrobe versatile especially in
0iNyfKxfFVM,1100720,1102559,our current climate and make your
0iNyfKxfFVM,1102559,1105200,wardrobe work harder for you then
0iNyfKxfFVM,1105200,1108400,accessories is the way to do it so
0iNyfKxfFVM,1108400,1110640,that's it for today's video thank you so
0iNyfKxfFVM,1110640,1113280,much for watching i will put some links
0iNyfKxfFVM,1113280,1115520,at the top of some other videos that i
0iNyfKxfFVM,1115520,1117679,recommend don't forget to have a look at
0iNyfKxfFVM,1117679,1119280,the body shape masterclass areas
0iNyfKxfFVM,1119280,1121600,hopefully you can identify with one of
0iNyfKxfFVM,1121600,1124480,the shapes on there for yourself
0iNyfKxfFVM,1124480,1126559,and i look forward to bringing you
0iNyfKxfFVM,1126559,1131120,another video next week thanks bye
