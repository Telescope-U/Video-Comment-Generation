T-JVpKku5SI,99,3718,Malcolm X once said that “Education is the passport to the future.”
T-JVpKku5SI,3719,6200,"But what if some passports are better than others,"
T-JVpKku5SI,6200,8590,giving the holder access to better schools and teachers
T-JVpKku5SI,8590,11280,"and, in turn, a more prosperous future?"
T-JVpKku5SI,11280,13599,"These inequalities have been around long before Covid-19,"
T-JVpKku5SI,13600,18080,"and yet, the pandemic has both exacerbated them and made them more visible."
T-JVpKku5SI,22500,25540,"While the standard of education varies greatly globally,"
T-JVpKku5SI,25540,29480,education inequality happens at the local level in all countries.
T-JVpKku5SI,29480,32960,"For example, only four out of every 100 children in Africa"
T-JVpKku5SI,32960,36420,"is expected to enter a graduate and postgraduate institution,"
T-JVpKku5SI,36420,39198,compared to 14 out of 100 in South and West Asia
T-JVpKku5SI,39200,42280,and 36 out of 100 in Latin America.
T-JVpKku5SI,42280,45500,"Even in developed countries, the quality of schooling can differ greatly,"
T-JVpKku5SI,45500,46860,whether rich or poor.
T-JVpKku5SI,46860,50380,"High national wealth then, is no guarantee of high equality."
T-JVpKku5SI,50380,55540,"The U.K., Germany and the U.S. are among the richest countries in the world, but all three rank poorly"
T-JVpKku5SI,55540,60000,on an educational inequality league table of 41 of the world’s richest countries.
T-JVpKku5SI,60000,63140,"By the middle of secondary school, educational inequalities are worse"
T-JVpKku5SI,63140,68180,"than in other countries with much smaller economies such as Latvia, Spain and Estonia."
T-JVpKku5SI,68180,72080,"However, research has shown that child development is linked with income."
T-JVpKku5SI,72080,74880,"Unsurprisingly, the U.S. and the U.K. have some of the"
T-JVpKku5SI,74880,78700,highest levels of income inequality among OECD countries.
T-JVpKku5SI,78700,83539,"In the U.K., there has been a significant lack of social mobility since 1945."
T-JVpKku5SI,83540,86939,"As wealth inequality has remained high, there hasn’t been much change"
T-JVpKku5SI,86940,89640,in how well British children are doing at school.
T-JVpKku5SI,89640,94060,"In a 2019 report by the education coalition Fair Education Alliance,"
T-JVpKku5SI,94060,98780,pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in the U.K. lag their peers by more than 8 months
T-JVpKku5SI,98780,101720,"in reading, writing and maths by age 11."
T-JVpKku5SI,101720,106440,"Children from persistently disadvantaged backgrounds are 22 months behind,"
T-JVpKku5SI,106440,110820,by the time they finish their school career. Small progress has been made
T-JVpKku5SI,110820,116718,in helping some children almost beat the odds and overcome the barriers that face them
T-JVpKku5SI,116718,120549,but the systemic underlying factors of our education system
T-JVpKku5SI,120549,125680,"still remain, which mean we’re not ever reaching the most persistently disadvantaged."
T-JVpKku5SI,125680,130200,"So, what are the contributing factors of education inequality among children?"
T-JVpKku5SI,130200,135000,"According to Unicef, a child’s educational progress is linked to their family background."
T-JVpKku5SI,135000,139080,What kind of jobs the parents have or whether the child is a first generation immigrant
T-JVpKku5SI,139080,142640,can affect the likelihood of them continuing into higher education.
T-JVpKku5SI,142640,148080,Inequality between genders is also apparent from a young age and tends to grow as children get older.
T-JVpKku5SI,148080,151920,Reading abilities among girls are generally better than boys by the age of nine
T-JVpKku5SI,151920,157319,"and, in turn, that discrepancy is more likely to continue in education beyond secondary school."
T-JVpKku5SI,157320,162200,"And finally, which school you go to can have a significant impact on your academic performance."
T-JVpKku5SI,162200,165530,"In many countries, the debate on inequality in education is seen"
T-JVpKku5SI,165530,168760,through the prism of private schools versus state schools.
T-JVpKku5SI,168760,174220,"The U.K. is home to some very famous private schools like Eton College and Harrow School, behind me."
T-JVpKku5SI,174220,179700,"Of the 55 British prime ministers, nearly half were educated at just these two schools,"
T-JVpKku5SI,179700,184700,"along with prominent actors, writers, scientists and royalty from across the world."
T-JVpKku5SI,184700,189640,"To compare, the entire state school education in England of a young person starting from nursery"
T-JVpKku5SI,189640,195000,"costs an average of around $96,000. The annual school fees at Harrow, however,"
T-JVpKku5SI,195000,199760,"cost around $56,000 for just one year of a child’s tuition."
T-JVpKku5SI,199760,202360,But even that is dwarfed by private schools in Switzerland
T-JVpKku5SI,202360,207240,"such as Le Rosey which costs more than $135,000 per year."
T-JVpKku5SI,207240,210740,Many believe that private education is at the root of inequality
T-JVpKku5SI,210740,213900,and reduces the chances for those children who attend state schools.
T-JVpKku5SI,213900,219540,The statistics tell us that educational privilege provides significant advantages and opens many doors.
T-JVpKku5SI,219540,224150,"In the U.K., nearly a third of members of parliament, two-thirds of the country’s top doctors"
T-JVpKku5SI,224150,230200,and 74% of judges were privately educated. The exam results also reflect the disparity.
T-JVpKku5SI,230200,234860,"In 2019, 45.7% of students at private schools in the U.K."
T-JVpKku5SI,234860,241540,got A* or As in their final year exams compared to the national average of 25.5%.
T-JVpKku5SI,241540,244840,But there are some state funded schools that buck that trend.
T-JVpKku5SI,244840,247420,This is Mulberry School for Girls in east London.
T-JVpKku5SI,247420,251180,"It’s located in one of the most disadvantaged areas in the city,"
T-JVpKku5SI,251180,255780,yet the exam performance of students here is well above national average.
T-JVpKku5SI,255780,259180,"Vanessa Ogden is the headteacher here, and for the last 15 years,"
T-JVpKku5SI,259180,263060,has been instrumental in seeing many of her pupils overturn the odds.
T-JVpKku5SI,263060,268860,"As a headteacher, how do you, in your role, help to tackle education inequality?"
T-JVpKku5SI,268860,275360,The first really important way is to have students leave with a really great set of qualifications
T-JVpKku5SI,275360,279740,and really great destinations to either university or apprenticeships
T-JVpKku5SI,279740,282300,"and so that’s the driving force, but of course,"
T-JVpKku5SI,282300,287199,inequality brings with it many structural difficulties in your life.
T-JVpKku5SI,287200,290860,"But while the pupils at Mulberry School have outperformed their peers for many years,"
T-JVpKku5SI,290860,294400,the Covid-19 pandemic may have undone much of that work.
T-JVpKku5SI,294400,300240,We know from the research that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected
T-JVpKku5SI,300240,306940,"people of Black, Asian and minority ethnic background and those are the families mainly that we serve"
T-JVpKku5SI,306940,312420,"and so not only has there been real difficulty around finance and resources,"
T-JVpKku5SI,312420,316720,but also real difficulty around health. The very first thing that reared its head
T-JVpKku5SI,316720,320680,"was period poverty, female students not being able to get sanitary products."
T-JVpKku5SI,320680,324940,We hadn’t realized that really in a way schools are the providers of some of those things.
T-JVpKku5SI,324940,328970,Stationery as well. So if you don’t have money or if the shops are shut
T-JVpKku5SI,328970,330420,and you don’t have stationery in the home.
T-JVpKku5SI,330420,336070,"And we lent out all the devices that we could, so that they could learn at home."
T-JVpKku5SI,336070,340960,"In terms of the reasons why Covid-19 has exacerbated the disadvantage gap,"
T-JVpKku5SI,340960,346479,"one big reason is the digital divide, but it’s also a resource divide in general."
T-JVpKku5SI,346480,350930,So some families might not have access to laptops to access online learning.
T-JVpKku5SI,350930,355960,They might not have a lot of space. The little progress we have made over the last ten years
T-JVpKku5SI,355960,360870,is likely to have been reversed by lockdown. So what was already a dire situation
T-JVpKku5SI,360870,363180,has been turned into quite a crisis.
T-JVpKku5SI,363180,368340,The pandemic also highlighted another aspect of education inequality: private tuition.
T-JVpKku5SI,368340,373110,"By mid-April, there were nationwide school closures in more than 190 countries,"
T-JVpKku5SI,373110,375500,affecting more than 1.5 billion learners.
T-JVpKku5SI,375500,378520,This led to an unprecedented demand for online teaching.
T-JVpKku5SI,378520,385759,"Some online tutoring platforms saw the number of daily users increase by 1,125% in two weeks."
T-JVpKku5SI,385760,389380,"In Singapore, there have even been calls to ban the private tuition industry"
T-JVpKku5SI,389380,391560,in an attempt to close the achievement gap.
T-JVpKku5SI,391560,396580,The Covid-19 pandemic also impacted students in the U.K. progressing to university.
T-JVpKku5SI,396580,400620,"Due to exams being canceled during the lockdown, results were given based on an algorithm,"
T-JVpKku5SI,400620,404800,"that critics claimed dragged dow high-achieving pupils in low-achieving schools,"
T-JVpKku5SI,404800,407259,compounding the inequalities they face.
T-JVpKku5SI,407260,411840,"The Department of Education and the exam boards initially responded by claiming there was no bias,"
T-JVpKku5SI,411840,415000,"whether on the grounds of deprivation, gender or ethnicity."
T-JVpKku5SI,415000,420200,"However, they eventually reversed their decision, with grades instead estimated by the students’teachers."
T-JVpKku5SI,420200,425340,"So, what can be done to reduce educational inequalities both here and around the world?"
T-JVpKku5SI,425340,429290,A former Singaporean education minister said in 2018 that there should be
T-JVpKku5SI,429290,433440,a broader definition of merit to recognize a wider range of skills.
T-JVpKku5SI,433440,438010,"We should double up on meritocracy, broaden its definition"
T-JVpKku5SI,438010,443260,"to embrace various talents and skills. We should not cap achievement at the top,"
T-JVpKku5SI,443260,446860,"but try harder, work harder, to lift the bottom."
T-JVpKku5SI,446860,450759,The Fair Education Alliance also believes there is too much reliance on exams
T-JVpKku5SI,450760,455800,and that education should be more holistic to include building aptitude and values.
T-JVpKku5SI,455800,458580,We want an education system which develops skills
T-JVpKku5SI,458580,461860,"and social and emotional competencies alongside academic attainment,"
T-JVpKku5SI,461860,467759,"we want teachers and leaders to be rewarded for serving the most disadvantaged students,"
T-JVpKku5SI,467760,473040,we want to engage parents and communities from all backgrounds in the education system
T-JVpKku5SI,473040,476320,and we want to prepare young people for what comes after school.
T-JVpKku5SI,476320,485479,Education is a way out of difficult situations. It’s also a means of moving yourself up the tree
T-JVpKku5SI,485479,489760,"in terms of prosperity, and not just financial prosperity"
T-JVpKku5SI,489760,495139,but also your kind of spiritual and cultural prosperity as well.
T-JVpKku5SI,495140,500100,It’s also the case that a policy that works in one country or region may not work in another.
T-JVpKku5SI,500100,504620,"Economic inequality, however, is likely to grow due to the Covid 19 pandemic."
T-JVpKku5SI,504620,508720,This means that creating better education systems is increasingly important
T-JVpKku5SI,508720,512599,so that a child’s starting point in life doesn’t determine their future.
T-JVpKku5SI,512599,514139,"You have to be an optimist,"
T-JVpKku5SI,514140,518640,"otherwise you’d pack up and go home in education, you know, you have to believe there is hope."
