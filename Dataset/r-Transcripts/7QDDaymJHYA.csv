7QDDaymJHYA,560,3280,boy it's been uh it's been 30 years
7QDDaymJHYA,3280,5040,i can't believe i'm i'm here at goodwood
7QDDaymJHYA,5040,6000,about to
7QDDaymJHYA,6000,9799,ride this beast again
7QDDaymJHYA,10790,15770,[Music]
7QDDaymJHYA,17860,33100,[Music]
7QDDaymJHYA,33520,35600,so wayne are you ready to be reconnected
7QDDaymJHYA,35600,38480,with your trusted steed from 1992. it's
7QDDaymJHYA,38480,41440,been in uh yamaha museum for 30 years
7QDDaymJHYA,41440,43200,and it's been silent
7QDDaymJHYA,43200,45840,so the duke of richmond
7QDDaymJHYA,45840,47600,had this idea about trying to get me
7QDDaymJHYA,47600,50000,back to see if we could uh
7QDDaymJHYA,50000,51600,ride this bike here
7QDDaymJHYA,51600,54480,at this year's event when i saw it when
7QDDaymJHYA,54480,56160,they had photos of it and they showed me
7QDDaymJHYA,56160,58719,that what it looked like in japan
7QDDaymJHYA,58719,61440,i mean it brought back great memories
7QDDaymJHYA,61440,64158,but when i think about that year
7QDDaymJHYA,64158,66000,what it was like to ride it it was
7QDDaymJHYA,66000,68400,anything but fun
7QDDaymJHYA,68400,71360,i think in 92 was probably the year that
7QDDaymJHYA,71360,76080,these bikes were very unforgiving and
7QDDaymJHYA,76080,78479,a lot of riders got hurt riding these
7QDDaymJHYA,78479,79759,bikes but
7QDDaymJHYA,79759,83439,you know it was well i was injured in 93
7QDDaymJHYA,83439,84720,the next year after we won the
7QDDaymJHYA,84720,88080,championship on this and in 93 i was uh
7QDDaymJHYA,88080,90320,racing kevin for the world championship
7QDDaymJHYA,90320,91119,and
7QDDaymJHYA,91119,92880,and then you know i made a mistake and
7QDDaymJHYA,92880,93840,and
7QDDaymJHYA,93840,96400,in mazano italy and that was the end of
7QDDaymJHYA,96400,99119,my racing career but i remember early on
7QDDaymJHYA,99119,101119,when i was still in hospital
7QDDaymJHYA,101119,102799,the thought i had was that you know i'd
7QDDaymJHYA,102799,105040,like to get back on the bike here we are
7QDDaymJHYA,105040,106880,30 years later and i'm actually going to
7QDDaymJHYA,106880,108960,throw a leg over this thing so
7QDDaymJHYA,108960,111920,i guess dreams do come true
7QDDaymJHYA,111920,112720,i'm
7QDDaymJHYA,112720,114479,injured from the chest down so i really
7QDDaymJHYA,114479,116799,don't feel anything except the bars
7QDDaymJHYA,116799,119040,so what i'm holding on to the bars and
7QDDaymJHYA,119040,122960,my my boots have uh bicycle clips
7QDDaymJHYA,122960,125040,like on a mountain bike yeah and then we
7QDDaymJHYA,125040,127040,have a strap that sits on the seat and
7QDDaymJHYA,127040,129520,then i set on top of the strap and that
7QDDaymJHYA,129520,132080,straps my legs over and puts those up
7QDDaymJHYA,132080,133920,against the fuel tank so i don't
7QDDaymJHYA,133920,136480,you know flop around that way i can feel
7QDDaymJHYA,136480,138480,the bike here in my chest right here
7QDDaymJHYA,138480,140160,against the tank pad
7QDDaymJHYA,140160,141360,to
7QDDaymJHYA,141360,143599,shift the bike to go up and up in the
7QDDaymJHYA,143599,144480,gear
7QDDaymJHYA,144480,147040,i hit the actual kill button
7QDDaymJHYA,147040,149040,so when i hit the kill button that that
7QDDaymJHYA,149040,150800,makes the bike shift up but that's
7QDDaymJHYA,150800,152239,that's really pretty easy considering
7QDDaymJHYA,152239,154000,how i backshift it
7QDDaymJHYA,154000,156319,so when you ride up two-stroke 500 grand
7QDDaymJHYA,156319,158800,pre-bike most all the riders ride with
7QDDaymJHYA,158800,160480,their fingers on the clutch
7QDDaymJHYA,160480,162239,that's how you back shift the bike is
7QDDaymJHYA,162239,164000,that you pull the clutch in and that
7QDDaymJHYA,164000,165920,back shifts the bike i just got to
7QDDaymJHYA,165920,167200,remember when i'm going through the
7QDDaymJHYA,167200,168560,turns don't
7QDDaymJHYA,168560,171280,don't pull the clutch in thinking that
7QDDaymJHYA,171280,173599,you know yeah like i used to so cause it
7QDDaymJHYA,173599,175519,a backshift i still don't really know
7QDDaymJHYA,175519,177519,what it's like to ride or on the hill
7QDDaymJHYA,177519,179440,yet i'm gonna find out for the first
7QDDaymJHYA,179440,180720,time tonight
7QDDaymJHYA,180720,183760,so yeah i'm a
7QDDaymJHYA,183760,185920,very curious about it very anxious about
7QDDaymJHYA,185920,186560,it
7QDDaymJHYA,186560,188080,but i'm very excited about it because i
7QDDaymJHYA,188080,190480,know i know when they fired the bike up
7QDDaymJHYA,190480,191519,earlier
7QDDaymJHYA,191519,193360,it sounded really nice it's a sound that
7QDDaymJHYA,193360,194720,i remember well
7QDDaymJHYA,194720,196400,and this bike was very good to me in
7QDDaymJHYA,196400,198959,many ways my son rex is here he was only
7QDDaymJHYA,198959,201040,10 months old when i was injured so he's
7QDDaymJHYA,201040,203200,never heard the bike or seen the bike
7QDDaymJHYA,203200,204959,he's never seen you on a grand prix bike
7QDDaymJHYA,204959,205840,no
7QDDaymJHYA,205840,208480,no and he'll actually be the one
7QDDaymJHYA,208480,210480,you know lifting me up to set me on the
7QDDaymJHYA,210480,212879,bike so he's been working out getting
7QDDaymJHYA,212879,214879,ready for this yeah
7QDDaymJHYA,214879,216959,we'll have a couple of guys with us when
7QDDaymJHYA,216959,218560,i go to start there'll be one on each
7QDDaymJHYA,218560,220640,side and somebody in front of me and
7QDDaymJHYA,220640,222720,i'll just give them a nod and then they
7QDDaymJHYA,222720,224400,just kind of give me a gentle nudge and
7QDDaymJHYA,224400,226159,then i'll just let the clutch out and
7QDDaymJHYA,226159,228480,that'll hopefully
7QDDaymJHYA,228480,231959,go in the right direction
7QDDaymJHYA,240100,249590,[Music]
7QDDaymJHYA,249590,250040,[Applause]
7QDDaymJHYA,250040,253728,[Music]
7QDDaymJHYA,257910,275779,[Music]

7QDDaymJHYA,299680,302960,that was cool all right wow
7QDDaymJHYA,302960,304479,what a thrill a little bit different
7QDDaymJHYA,304479,308000,than the last time i wrote it yeah
7QDDaymJHYA,308840,312160,wow wants to put all my joints in place
7QDDaymJHYA,312160,316240,this is crazy crazy acceleration
7QDDaymJHYA,316400,318080,that was fun i wish i wasn't running out
7QDDaymJHYA,318080,319520,of sunshine
7QDDaymJHYA,319520,321120,again
7QDDaymJHYA,321120,324080,you want to get it again yeah
7QDDaymJHYA,324080,325680,was it anything
7QDDaymJHYA,325680,327919,like you remembered in terms of the
7QDDaymJHYA,327919,329759,power of the delivery
7QDDaymJHYA,329759,331600,i didn't even actually get it on the
7QDDaymJHYA,331600,333680,pipe it was well you know when this bike
7QDDaymJHYA,333680,335520,starts to run at about
7QDDaymJHYA,335520,336840,8 500
7QDDaymJHYA,336840,339919,rpm hopefully i can uh get it in that
7QDDaymJHYA,339919,341919,range next time i ride it how was it for
7QDDaymJHYA,341919,344080,you how do you feel we were he was so
7QDDaymJHYA,344080,345360,far ahead of us we couldn't keep up with
7QDDaymJHYA,345360,346639,him so
7QDDaymJHYA,346639,348000,i mean to put it bluntly that's probably
7QDDaymJHYA,348000,349520,how a lot of his competitors felt racing
7QDDaymJHYA,349520,351039,against him for for years and years but
