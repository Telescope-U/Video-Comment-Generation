YM_-jCmNKRc,11679,14240,today i'm driving the defender v8
YM_-jCmNKRc,14240,17240,supercharged
YM_-jCmNKRc,26970,28480,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,28480,30560,and i brought it uh twin brother
YM_-jCmNKRc,30560,31840,technically
YM_-jCmNKRc,31840,34719,the range rover sport svr so technically
YM_-jCmNKRc,34719,37520,they share the same engine but
YM_-jCmNKRc,37520,40000,the difference is that one makes
YM_-jCmNKRc,40000,41280,a bit more horsepower which is the
YM_-jCmNKRc,41280,45840,defender and that's actually lighter
YM_-jCmNKRc,51390,54600,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,59520,61039,so we're gonna find out how these two
YM_-jCmNKRc,61039,62399,compare because technically they share
YM_-jCmNKRc,62399,64400,the exact same engine
YM_-jCmNKRc,64400,67600,and they also share pretty much the
YM_-jCmNKRc,67600,69280,transmission drivetrain and a bunch of
YM_-jCmNKRc,69280,70080,things together because they're
YM_-jCmNKRc,70080,71760,technically on the same company
YM_-jCmNKRc,71760,72640,so
YM_-jCmNKRc,72640,74640,i'm going to take them into a quarter
YM_-jCmNKRc,74640,76720,mile test we're also going to do a roll
YM_-jCmNKRc,76720,78880,and find out how do these two compare
YM_-jCmNKRc,78880,81200,and which one is the faster one now mind
YM_-jCmNKRc,81200,83119,you that range rover i don't know if
YM_-jCmNKRc,83119,84799,you'll be able to take that off-road the
YM_-jCmNKRc,84799,87119,same way as you would with the defender
YM_-jCmNKRc,87119,89759,but nonetheless uh the whole point is
YM_-jCmNKRc,89759,91200,today we're gonna find out how quick
YM_-jCmNKRc,91200,94560,they are so let's talk about the specs
YM_-jCmNKRc,94560,97840,the range rover sport svr uses a five
YM_-jCmNKRc,97840,101360,liter v8 supercharged engine 32 vault it
YM_-jCmNKRc,101360,104520,makes 510 horsepower and
YM_-jCmNKRc,104520,107200,461 pound-feet of torque it uses an
YM_-jCmNKRc,107200,109119,8-speed automatic transmission i believe
YM_-jCmNKRc,109119,110880,it is a zf
YM_-jCmNKRc,110880,112799,and it is of course all-wheel drive it
YM_-jCmNKRc,112799,115920,will 360 in 4.7 seconds
YM_-jCmNKRc,115920,119000,but it weighs 5
YM_-jCmNKRc,119000,121280,564 pounds
YM_-jCmNKRc,121280,123680,that's not light but then we go into the
YM_-jCmNKRc,123680,127439,defender v8 which also uses
YM_-jCmNKRc,127439,130319,a 5 liter v8 supercharged which is
YM_-jCmNKRc,130319,132319,pretty much the same as that
YM_-jCmNKRc,132319,135840,and it makes 518 horsepower 8 horsepower
YM_-jCmNKRc,135840,136720,more
YM_-jCmNKRc,136720,139599,than the range rover sport svr but the
YM_-jCmNKRc,139599,142239,torque is the same 461 pound-feet of
YM_-jCmNKRc,142239,143280,torque
YM_-jCmNKRc,143280,146000,this though it does 0-60 in 4.9 seconds
YM_-jCmNKRc,146000,148720,so it's 0.2 seconds slower than the
YM_-jCmNKRc,148720,150160,beast beside it
YM_-jCmNKRc,150160,151840,top speed for both of them i believe
YM_-jCmNKRc,151840,154239,this one is 150
YM_-jCmNKRc,154239,156000,miles per hour and i believe the
YM_-jCmNKRc,156000,158640,supercharged uh range rover it's over
YM_-jCmNKRc,158640,159840,that
YM_-jCmNKRc,159840,162000,but they both use the same 8-speed
YM_-jCmNKRc,162000,163920,automatic transmission the curb weight
YM_-jCmNKRc,163920,165040,though for
YM_-jCmNKRc,165040,165920,this
YM_-jCmNKRc,165920,168879,defender is 5 735 pounds so it's about
YM_-jCmNKRc,168879,172080,200 pounds heavier than the svr and it
YM_-jCmNKRc,172080,174959,happened to be that ryan and i
YM_-jCmNKRc,174959,177840,have the same weight
YM_-jCmNKRc,178319,180640,can you hear me sir
YM_-jCmNKRc,180640,182800,dude
YM_-jCmNKRc,182800,186720,uh mr ryan uh we're gonna do one from uh
YM_-jCmNKRc,186720,189680,digg uh you're gonna follow richard he's
YM_-jCmNKRc,189680,190959,gonna explain to you how we do the
YM_-jCmNKRc,190959,192319,launch control
YM_-jCmNKRc,192319,195519,uh and on this side i'm gonna put mine
YM_-jCmNKRc,195519,198560,in dynamic mode that's the only option i
YM_-jCmNKRc,198560,199440,have and i'm going to put the
YM_-jCmNKRc,199440,201920,transmission into sport mode what modes
YM_-jCmNKRc,201920,204159,are you in
YM_-jCmNKRc,204159,204959,uh
YM_-jCmNKRc,204959,206000,i will be
YM_-jCmNKRc,206000,207040,in
YM_-jCmNKRc,207040,208959,dynamic mode and i'll switch the car and
YM_-jCmNKRc,208959,213000,automatic sport mode as well too

YM_-jCmNKRc,239280,241840,what
YM_-jCmNKRc,252840,255599,now no
YM_-jCmNKRc,255599,257759,i'm taking him now
YM_-jCmNKRc,257759,260560,come on come on
YM_-jCmNKRc,263360,265360,oh my gosh
YM_-jCmNKRc,265360,269638,this is so cool
YM_-jCmNKRc,277360,279600,i think i just barely took that just
YM_-jCmNKRc,279600,282600,barely
YM_-jCmNKRc,282880,286720,oh that was fun that was fun
YM_-jCmNKRc,290560,291919,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,291919,293360,okay we're gonna do this again because
YM_-jCmNKRc,293360,294880,it seemed like he had a bit of a slight
YM_-jCmNKRc,294880,297840,delay on the first one
YM_-jCmNKRc,298940,302040,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,314080,316720,now we're there
YM_-jCmNKRc,318240,321520,ah now we're talking
YM_-jCmNKRc,321520,325840,yeah you see that's the thing like
YM_-jCmNKRc,327919,330639,now we're there
YM_-jCmNKRc,330639,333199,look at that
YM_-jCmNKRc,336000,339560,he's so happy
YM_-jCmNKRc,351120,352560,it's the thing like i don't think you
YM_-jCmNKRc,352560,354479,had the best uh
YM_-jCmNKRc,354479,356880,launch control at first like the best uh
YM_-jCmNKRc,356880,358720,takeoff but now you did on the second
YM_-jCmNKRc,358720,360080,one because it doesn't make any sense
YM_-jCmNKRc,360080,363080,right
YM_-jCmNKRc,367980,371119,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,372240,375240,so
YM_-jCmNKRc,380080,383319,let's see
YM_-jCmNKRc,405120,409840,oh not too far very close
YM_-jCmNKRc,409840,414680,not too far but he got it
YM_-jCmNKRc,429980,433369,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,434880,437360,okay mr ryan we're gonna do we're gonna
YM_-jCmNKRc,437360,439520,do this now again same way just follow
YM_-jCmNKRc,439520,441120,my lead but this time we're gonna do the
YM_-jCmNKRc,441120,442639,second cone which should get us about
YM_-jCmNKRc,442639,444720,100 kilometers an hour so and then you
YM_-jCmNKRc,444720,446160,hammer it but you're doing very well the
YM_-jCmNKRc,446160,448720,reflexes are awesome so as i say let's
YM_-jCmNKRc,448720,451720,roll
YM_-jCmNKRc,470400,475160,oh man he is going
YM_-jCmNKRc,482879,485120,even if he has a slow reaction that
YM_-jCmNKRc,485120,488400,thing's still going whoa
YM_-jCmNKRc,488960,491120,let's go baby
YM_-jCmNKRc,491120,492639,but he got it
YM_-jCmNKRc,492639,496080,and i hit 160.
YM_-jCmNKRc,499599,501680,ryan thank you so much for joining us
YM_-jCmNKRc,501680,503840,this was awesome this was it sir you did
YM_-jCmNKRc,503840,505039,very well
YM_-jCmNKRc,505039,507120,um i mean we knew that that thing is
YM_-jCmNKRc,507120,510240,faster because 0 to 60 it's 0.2 seconds
YM_-jCmNKRc,510240,512399,faster so nonetheless was a lot of fun i
YM_-jCmNKRc,512399,515990,hope you enjoyed as much as i did
YM_-jCmNKRc,515990,519029,[Music]
YM_-jCmNKRc,524480,526560,i'm happy that you're able to enjoy it
YM_-jCmNKRc,526560,529040,i'm glad uh that is a beast of a machine
YM_-jCmNKRc,529040,531120,um and i'm actually very happy that you
YM_-jCmNKRc,531120,532640,join us so that way we could see what's
YM_-jCmNKRc,532640,535920,going on thank you sir again
YM_-jCmNKRc,535920,537040,thank you man
YM_-jCmNKRc,537040,538800,that was it guys as expected they're
YM_-jCmNKRc,538800,542000,very close but not too close uh but they
YM_-jCmNKRc,542000,543279,technically share the same engine the
YM_-jCmNKRc,543279,545279,difference is that is lighter so that's
YM_-jCmNKRc,545279,547279,where it wins but it's good to see that
YM_-jCmNKRc,547279,548800,difference i'm sure a lot of people are
YM_-jCmNKRc,548800,550000,probably questioning like which one
YM_-jCmNKRc,550000,551680,actually is faster because zero six is
YM_-jCmNKRc,551680,553279,something the quarter miles are
YM_-jCmNKRc,553279,554880,something so we're able to do two from a
YM_-jCmNKRc,554880,557600,dig and the first one come on i'm in
YM_-jCmNKRc,557600,559040,park mode
YM_-jCmNKRc,559040,562959,oh jesus christ okay fine i put it
YM_-jCmNKRc,562959,564080,and
YM_-jCmNKRc,564080,565839,without seat belts right
YM_-jCmNKRc,565839,566959,but
YM_-jCmNKRc,566959,569920,it it's it's just amazing to see this in
YM_-jCmNKRc,569920,573360,action in my opinion so i think this is
YM_-jCmNKRc,573360,575200,quite an unbelievable machine but
YM_-jCmNKRc,575200,576800,bringing here to the track it actually
YM_-jCmNKRc,576800,578480,shows the other side not just the
YM_-jCmNKRc,578480,581440,off-road but the performance side which
YM_-jCmNKRc,581440,582640,i think they've done a great job and
YM_-jCmNKRc,582640,584320,it's a hot day today so i'm literally
YM_-jCmNKRc,584320,586399,sweating everywhere um but it's the
YM_-jCmNKRc,586399,587839,perfect day because you want to have a
YM_-jCmNKRc,587839,589440,bit of heat it's not extremely hot but
YM_-jCmNKRc,589440,591120,just a bit of heat but otherwise that
YM_-jCmNKRc,591120,592800,was a lot of fun and of course the ac is
YM_-jCmNKRc,592800,593600,off
YM_-jCmNKRc,593600,594800,thanks for watching guys don't forget to
