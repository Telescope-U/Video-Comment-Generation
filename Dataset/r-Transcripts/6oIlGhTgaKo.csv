6oIlGhTgaKo,240,1943,"- Ooh, whoa."
6oIlGhTgaKo,2970,3920,Now I won't say.
6oIlGhTgaKo,3920,7870,That Chase is a gamer nerd who lives in his mother's
6oIlGhTgaKo,7870,11490,"basement. Cause that's a, a mean hurtful stereotype,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,11490,14330,"but he's not really leaving me a lot of choices. I mean,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,14330,16280,look at him. This is your parent's house Chase.
6oIlGhTgaKo,16280,18780,- Yeah it is. I couldn't move out because of COVID.
6oIlGhTgaKo,18780,21120,"So, you know, I'm stuck in here for a little bit longer."
6oIlGhTgaKo,21120,22267,"- Yeah, all I hear is."
6oIlGhTgaKo,22267,24020,(unintelligible mocking)
6oIlGhTgaKo,24020,25470,- I'm not trying to pay rent.
6oIlGhTgaKo,27209,29792,(upbeat music)
6oIlGhTgaKo,38230,40720,"- I got to say, as far as basement man caves go,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,40720,43400,it's looking pretty good. We got the mini fridge.
6oIlGhTgaKo,43400,46490,We got the TV with the PlayStation 4.
6oIlGhTgaKo,46490,49520,"I'm lovin' the decor in here. And of course,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,49520,54520,"Chase already has an absolutely sick gaming setup,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,54830,57487,which sort of raises the question.
6oIlGhTgaKo,57487,59620,What are we going to do to transform this space?
6oIlGhTgaKo,59620,61670,- We are going to be upgrading the computer.
6oIlGhTgaKo,61670,62969,"It's already pretty good, but you know,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,62970,63890,it can always be better.
6oIlGhTgaKo,63890,66330,"We got some even better hardware than I currently have,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,66330,68320,and we're going to be putting in some new furniture and
6oIlGhTgaKo,68320,71040,"rearranging it. So it's going to be kind of a big change,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,71040,72210,but it's not just the computer.
6oIlGhTgaKo,72210,74370,It's a lot of other little things as well.
6oIlGhTgaKo,74370,75820,- Let's check out the setup here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,75820,78300,So you're rocking the 2080 Super.
6oIlGhTgaKo,78300,81000,- Wow. You've got like Dominator Platinum Memory.
6oIlGhTgaKo,81000,83580,What the hell are we even upgrading about this thing?
6oIlGhTgaKo,83580,85450,"- I don't know how to describe it. Every once in a while,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,85450,87340,"the graphics driver does like to crash. In fact,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,87340,89009,"it happened last night,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,89010,91760,but I have a feeling that it had more to do with Cold War
6oIlGhTgaKo,91760,94940,being a little jank sometimes than the computer itself.
6oIlGhTgaKo,94940,98000,- Now something you guys might not know about Chase is that
6oIlGhTgaKo,98000,100190,"while here at Linus Tech Tips, we're,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,100190,102890,we're gamers. Chase is a GAMER.
6oIlGhTgaKo,102890,106880,"Unless your name is David or Edzel or Luke, he's"
6oIlGhTgaKo,106880,110700,probably gonna make you look stupid in pretty much any game.
6oIlGhTgaKo,110700,112619,So I have two agendas here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,112620,116290,One is to help him reach his peak gamer potential.
6oIlGhTgaKo,116290,119370,And number two is to maybe find some way to
6oIlGhTgaKo,119370,121970,sabotage him a little bit for the next time we play.
6oIlGhTgaKo,123781,125350,How's he going to bungie that?
6oIlGhTgaKo,125350,127928,- That's my only mouse at the moment. So don't break it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,127928,129350,"(Linus) - That's okay, You got lots of controllers."
6oIlGhTgaKo,129350,131610,"Rocking the PlayStation 2, rocking the"
6oIlGhTgaKo,131610,134550,"other more different PlayStation 2. You lied,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,134550,138393,you do have another mouse. This is how we sabotage him.
6oIlGhTgaKo,139460,141560,Now let's have a look at what we're going to be doing in
6oIlGhTgaKo,141560,143633,terms of upgrades.
6oIlGhTgaKo,144550,146570,Okay. Some things are going to be legit upgrades.
6oIlGhTgaKo,146570,149040,"This is Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,149040,151420,which is obviously brought to you by Intel.
6oIlGhTgaKo,151420,153080,And we're going to be going full bore with a
6oIlGhTgaKo,153080,156620,Core i9 11900K processor.
6oIlGhTgaKo,156620,159690,So we're going one of those and RTX 3080.
6oIlGhTgaKo,159690,162470,This is going to be among the fastest gaming machines.
6oIlGhTgaKo,162470,163860,"Money can buy,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,163860,166560,but we're also doing some stuff that's more tailored to
6oIlGhTgaKo,166560,169359,Chase's personal preference like this
6oIlGhTgaKo,169359,173853,Sony Trinitron 20 inch CRT TV.
6oIlGhTgaKo,173853,174950,"(Chase) Yeah, 20 inch"
6oIlGhTgaKo,174950,177090,- 20 inches. Wow.
6oIlGhTgaKo,177090,181739,"That's like some big donger CRT, at least,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,181740,182910,"you know, from the side."
6oIlGhTgaKo,182910,184580,- We're going to be upgrading some of the furniture.
6oIlGhTgaKo,184580,185900,I don't have a TV stand.
6oIlGhTgaKo,185900,188590,So we're going to be changing out the coffee table for this
6oIlGhTgaKo,188590,189532,TV. Stand here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,189532,190430,(Linus) I see some rugs.
6oIlGhTgaKo,190430,191879,"- Yeah, we're going to get some rugs."
6oIlGhTgaKo,191880,194030,"Unfortunately, I don't have one in the room at the moment."
6oIlGhTgaKo,194030,196520,The monitor as well. That's like a 27 inch.
6oIlGhTgaKo,196520,198480,I think it's like 200 something hertz.
6oIlGhTgaKo,198480,199700,So that's a bit of an upgrade.
6oIlGhTgaKo,199700,200690,It's going to be really nice.
6oIlGhTgaKo,200690,203650,"We're putting in some nanoleaf light bulbs,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,203650,206329,So that'll be sick. And we're doing a bit of a retro mod on
6oIlGhTgaKo,206330,208950,"the PS2, so we're going to be putting a hard drive in it"
6oIlGhTgaKo,208950,211690,"and then you can use this memory card to rip your games,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,211690,213520,to write to the hard drive and play them off of that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,213520,215850,"So no more, no more of a need for CDs."
6oIlGhTgaKo,215850,216880,- That is sick.
6oIlGhTgaKo,216880,218460,"For those of you who are new to the series,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,218460,222098,"Intel is providing 5,000 US dollar budgets for tech"
6oIlGhTgaKo,222098,225235,"make-overs for my staff, and Chase,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,225235,227587,he's getting a lot of bang for the buck here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,227587,229570,And we haven't even talked about the desk yet.
6oIlGhTgaKo,229570,232200,Man we're going to have to haul a ton of stuff out of there.
6oIlGhTgaKo,232200,233485,Better get started.
6oIlGhTgaKo,233485,235030,(Chase) I had considered going with a
6oIlGhTgaKo,235030,237209,"automatic adjusting desk, but they were just"
6oIlGhTgaKo,237210,239720,"hella expensive, so I didn't want to spend that."
6oIlGhTgaKo,239720,241450,"- If it doesn't give more FPS,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,241450,243239,it's not making its way into this setup.
6oIlGhTgaKo,243240,246040,I'll set up to build here then. And what are we doing?
6oIlGhTgaKo,246040,247569,"I noticed we have a new case,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,247570,249660,but you mentioned reusing that one.
6oIlGhTgaKo,249660,252120,- The plan right now is we're going to take most of the
6oIlGhTgaKo,252120,255260,"guts out of this computer. Put them in the new case,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,255260,257820,"take all the new parts and put them back in this case,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,257820,260445,we're going to leave in the storage and the AIO cause it
6oIlGhTgaKo,260445,262920,fits really nicely. I don't want to touch it at the moment.
6oIlGhTgaKo,262920,265140,- So basically you hate me and you want me to
6oIlGhTgaKo,265140,267820,have to build two computers instead of just one.
6oIlGhTgaKo,267820,268810,- It's two for the price of one.
6oIlGhTgaKo,268810,270350,"So, you know, it's pretty good."
6oIlGhTgaKo,270350,271927,- At least I don't have to paint the wall. Okay.
6oIlGhTgaKo,271927,273800,"- You just need the computer, right? So..."
6oIlGhTgaKo,273800,275007,"- I guess, yeah."
6oIlGhTgaKo,275007,276069,(Crashing)
6oIlGhTgaKo,276070,277543,Oh God. What just...?
6oIlGhTgaKo,278980,280710,- I didn't screw in the side panel.
6oIlGhTgaKo,280710,281930,- I see that. Wow.
6oIlGhTgaKo,281930,285026,"Did dbrand just send you a bunch of sticker bomb, wrap?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,285026,286396,(Chase) Yeah. I had to cut it myself.
6oIlGhTgaKo,286396,287229,"(Linus) Yeah, I see that."
6oIlGhTgaKo,287229,289337,"(Chase) If you don't look too closely, it looks really good."
6oIlGhTgaKo,289337,291450,(Linus) Yeah... About that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,291450,296140,Do you have the chocolate power supply from Tech Showdown?
6oIlGhTgaKo,296140,296973,(Chase) I have a receipt.
6oIlGhTgaKo,296973,297873,"- You got a receipt, huh?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,297873,299896,"(Chase) Yeah, or I had."
6oIlGhTgaKo,299897,300747,"- ""Had""."
6oIlGhTgaKo,301810,303480,- The plan for the second computer is
6oIlGhTgaKo,303480,305200,I'm probably going to put unwrite on it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,305200,307930,And I'm going to run some game servers and possibly a
6oIlGhTgaKo,307930,311080,Windows VM and figure out something else to do with it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,311080,313800,- Not your fault. You already had a decent computer.
6oIlGhTgaKo,313800,315039,"- I'm not going to water cool it,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,315040,318780,I feel like I would not maintain it very well knowing me.
6oIlGhTgaKo,318780,319613,"- I mean,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,319613,323580,your machine's in far better condition than David's was.
6oIlGhTgaKo,323580,325289,"(Chase) Thankfully my dogs are Maltese,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,325290,326560,so they don't really shed that much.
6oIlGhTgaKo,326560,330400,I had to get a USB 3.0 header adapter because the cable
6oIlGhTgaKo,330400,332750,that comes with the case doesn't fit with the sleds
6oIlGhTgaKo,332750,333800,for the SSD there.
6oIlGhTgaKo,333800,336120,- It's really tight. I can't get it off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,336120,339510,"Oh, everything is totally under control."
6oIlGhTgaKo,339510,342100,Your computer will be all in one piece when we're done.
6oIlGhTgaKo,342100,344780,"- Well we got two of them. So as long as one of them works,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,344780,345700,we're good.
6oIlGhTgaKo,345700,347590,- There we go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,347590,349110,"Hey, board's coming out."
6oIlGhTgaKo,349110,352395,Does the dope special edition RAM stay on this board?
6oIlGhTgaKo,352395,354720,(Chase) No. we got an extra RAM and I definitely have
6oIlGhTgaKo,354720,355716,a receipt for that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,355716,356650,"(Linus) Yeah I was going to say,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,356650,359070,this looks it's from the office too.
6oIlGhTgaKo,359070,361223,Do you have any specific rationale behind the choices here?
6oIlGhTgaKo,361223,363759,Like 11900K. That's pretty obvious.
6oIlGhTgaKo,363760,365510,"You just wanted more FPS,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,365510,370510,but what about like the TUF Z590 motherboard for example?
6oIlGhTgaKo,370600,372677,- I didn't feel like spending any more money than what the
6oIlGhTgaKo,372677,374640,"TUF was worth, even as part of the upgrade."
6oIlGhTgaKo,374640,377280,"So that's why I went with that one and the 3080,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,377280,380080,"because it's the 3080, and I didn't want to buy a 3090."
6oIlGhTgaKo,380080,381000,- Okay. Fair enough.
6oIlGhTgaKo,381000,383660,"And I guess as far as FTW3 Ultra goes,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,383660,385376,it was the one we could get.
6oIlGhTgaKo,385376,386560,"(Chase) It was the one we could get,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,386560,388260,- That's typically the story with these
6oIlGhTgaKo,388260,390330,Intel extreme tech upgrades.
6oIlGhTgaKo,390330,393560,"Thanks EVG. Because at MSRP, you know,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,393560,395900,"these will fit in a $5,000 upgrade."
6oIlGhTgaKo,395900,399740,"At scalper prices, his is the $5,000 upgrade."
6oIlGhTgaKo,399740,401009,"Chase may not care about them,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,401010,403340,but a couple of really great features from my point of view
6oIlGhTgaKo,403340,405889,are the inclusion of 2.5 gig ethernet.
6oIlGhTgaKo,405890,407960,"That's going to be more relevant in the future,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,407960,410639,especially if he's going to be running an Unraid NAS
6oIlGhTgaKo,410640,411490,separately in the house.
6oIlGhTgaKo,411490,414770,And he wants to have really quick access to those files.
6oIlGhTgaKo,414770,418129,"And of course, support for PCI express, gen four storage."
6oIlGhTgaKo,418130,421300,"Today, your storage doesn't make a huge difference to"
6oIlGhTgaKo,421300,422680,"the gaming experience,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,422680,424120,but give it a little bit of time with
6oIlGhTgaKo,424120,425840,Microsoft's direct storage
6oIlGhTgaKo,425840,430100,and all of a sudden the GPU could need high speed access to
6oIlGhTgaKo,430100,433030,your storage drive. And that's going to enable that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,433030,435389,Now I've got to scavenge the m.2 SSD from the old board.
6oIlGhTgaKo,435390,436760,"I actually don't know what he's running,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,436760,439454,so we'll see if it's gen four or not.
6oIlGhTgaKo,439454,442230,"- Wish I had a drill, but this is fine."
6oIlGhTgaKo,442230,443540,- We got the old SSD out.
6oIlGhTgaKo,443540,446360,"The good news is 660P, one terabyte."
6oIlGhTgaKo,446360,448060,"Good drive, solid drive."
6oIlGhTgaKo,448060,450760,The bad news is it's not PCI express gen four.
6oIlGhTgaKo,450760,452500,So what we're going to do is we're going to install it in
6oIlGhTgaKo,452500,456170,one of the two PCI express gen three slots.
6oIlGhTgaKo,456170,458500,And we will leave this open for
6oIlGhTgaKo,458500,460520,a future gen four upgrade.
6oIlGhTgaKo,460520,462849,How do you have so many standoffs
6oIlGhTgaKo,462850,464200,and none of them are the right one?
6oIlGhTgaKo,464200,466490,"- I don't know. It could have been for this cooler,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,466490,467930,but I'm not sure.
6oIlGhTgaKo,467930,469270,"- No, I don't think so."
6oIlGhTgaKo,469270,471000,"- I clearly gave someone the wrong hardware,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,471000,472923,but it must've worked out cause they never contacted me.
6oIlGhTgaKo,472923,474520,- This is a little awkward Chase.
6oIlGhTgaKo,474520,477009,I know that you spent probably a lot of money on this
6oIlGhTgaKo,477010,478770,"Special Edition Dominator Platinum,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,478770,481009,and you had intended to keep using it in the gaming rig.
6oIlGhTgaKo,481010,483930,This Vengeance LPX is substantially faster.
6oIlGhTgaKo,483930,486988,"This is 3,600 CL14."
6oIlGhTgaKo,486989,487822,(Chase) Throw that in there then.
6oIlGhTgaKo,487822,489780,- You also don't need more than 16 gigs of RAM in
6oIlGhTgaKo,489780,491490,your gaming rig. And this is like
6oIlGhTgaKo,491490,494589,a 32 gig kit. So that goes into the server. I think.
6oIlGhTgaKo,494589,495422,(Chase) No problem.
6oIlGhTgaKo,495422,499330,- Dominator Platinum home server with unraid.
6oIlGhTgaKo,499330,500270,- I got a good deal on it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,500270,502259,I didn't actually spend that much on the RAM.
6oIlGhTgaKo,502260,503260,"- Well, it's not that fast."
6oIlGhTgaKo,503260,505720,It's just fancy looking. So it's fine.
6oIlGhTgaKo,505720,508360,"Yeah. You got all flash. You got no dash,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,508360,510120,but now you've got dash too.
6oIlGhTgaKo,510120,514610,"That moment when you buy the fanciest most specialist RAM,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,514610,518979,and then you swap it out for some basic Vengeance LPX.
6oIlGhTgaKo,518979,521139,- I'm just installing the cable management tray.
6oIlGhTgaKo,521140,524072,"I think it's a little short, so might have to drill holes."
6oIlGhTgaKo,524072,525150,Might not. We'll see.
6oIlGhTgaKo,525150,526970,"- Well, you might not have any mounting hardware,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,526970,531970,but at least we can kind of jam the motherboard in here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,532100,536959,"Just gotta, just gotta kind of oop, finangle it a little,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,536960,538410,"don't worry, Chase it'll be fine."
6oIlGhTgaKo,538410,541889,He looks like the nervous expectant father while his wife's
6oIlGhTgaKo,541890,543130,delivering her baby.
6oIlGhTgaKo,543130,544380,"- I know for a fact,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,544380,547250,"you're going to have a hard time plugging in the power,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,547250,549970,cable that's for the CPU specifically.
6oIlGhTgaKo,549970,554100,"- I promise you. I will have that in, in 30 seconds."
6oIlGhTgaKo,554100,555503,Okay. Timer go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,557750,558653,There's half.
6oIlGhTgaKo,561441,562647,There's the other half.
6oIlGhTgaKo,562648,564580,(Chase) I'm glad you're building the computer and I'm not.
6oIlGhTgaKo,564580,565517,- I did cheat a little bit.
6oIlGhTgaKo,565517,567700,"The motherboard's not really screwed in,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,567700,569683,so there's some wiggle room.
6oIlGhTgaKo,569683,573459,"Man, so far, this is the easiest extreme tech upgrade yet."
6oIlGhTgaKo,573460,574293,"- All right, we did it."
6oIlGhTgaKo,574293,576540,"It's good enough. It's really just to hold some cables,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,576540,578910,"so it's a little jank, but I don't care that much."
6oIlGhTgaKo,578910,581370,So one of the things that we're doing to the PlayStation 2
6oIlGhTgaKo,581370,585960,I have is we're going to install a hard drive.
6oIlGhTgaKo,585960,589200,Now the problem is the new hard drives that are SATA
6oIlGhTgaKo,589200,591683,don't connect to the old network adapter that you can get.
6oIlGhTgaKo,591683,595010,So we had to get a third little mini board and we got to
6oIlGhTgaKo,595010,598090,"install it to this, install that to the PS2,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,598090,599617,plug in the memory card and then we're good to go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,599617,601230,- I'm just waiting for logistics to
6oIlGhTgaKo,601230,604070,bring me the mounting hardware that I need for the CPU.
6oIlGhTgaKo,604070,608040,and then I am good to throw the graphics card in.
6oIlGhTgaKo,608040,610070,"Oh actually, and one other thing,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,610070,613440,"Chase is going for a live gamer duo capture card,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,613440,616831,"which will presumably allow... Chase, do you stream?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,616831,618313,(Chase) I do stream a bit.
6oIlGhTgaKo,618313,620470,"(Linus) This has two HDMI inputs,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,620470,623688,which allows you to have your camera as well as an external
6oIlGhTgaKo,623688,626515,"device, such as a game console plugged in, so"
6oIlGhTgaKo,626515,630090,"Nintendo Switch goes in here, camera goes in here and boom."
6oIlGhTgaKo,630090,631460,"The PC can do all the streaming. I mean,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,631460,634330,he talked about doing a dual PC streaming setup or something
6oIlGhTgaKo,634330,637820,"like that, but they can be a bit of a pain in the butt."
6oIlGhTgaKo,637820,638750,Nice capture card.
6oIlGhTgaKo,638750,641290,Does up to 240 FPS
6oIlGhTgaKo,641290,642220,1080p.
6oIlGhTgaKo,642220,646420,"Input, one supports 4k, and the other one does not at all"
6oIlGhTgaKo,646420,649690,and then it does pass through 4k 60 if you really to.
6oIlGhTgaKo,649690,651160,"- HDMI one is going to be, yeah,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,651160,654100,any of the retro game consoles or like the PS4.
6oIlGhTgaKo,654100,656540,And then the second one will just be my camera input.
6oIlGhTgaKo,656540,658500,I'm currently using a webcam.
6oIlGhTgaKo,658500,660350,If you can see over there on the desk and I'm going to be
6oIlGhTgaKo,660350,661740,upgrading to a camera.
6oIlGhTgaKo,661740,663250,- What's your Twitch username then?
6oIlGhTgaKo,663250,666640,"- toomuchcontra, no spaces, no caps."
6oIlGhTgaKo,666640,668660,- Can you really ever have too much contra?
6oIlGhTgaKo,668660,670529,- I finally got the cover off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,670530,673420,"I had a couple more screws that were really small,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,673420,674910,but after that it popped right off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,674910,675779,"Not the ones on the back,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,675780,679130,"those are actually for screwing it into the PlayStation 2,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,679130,681300,but now I got to remove this little daughterboard that they
6oIlGhTgaKo,681300,682769,"have, I guess that's what you would call it."
6oIlGhTgaKo,682770,684390,So that'll take a couple more screws and
6oIlGhTgaKo,684390,685961,hopefully it pops right off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,685961,687020,"- Oh, okay."
6oIlGhTgaKo,687020,689090,"Oh, that's super cool."
6oIlGhTgaKo,689090,693193,Not as cool as this 3080 I'm about to install though.
6oIlGhTgaKo,694296,695129,(Chase) It's pretty powerful.
6oIlGhTgaKo,695129,695962,- Good flex.
6oIlGhTgaKo,695962,697660,"(Chase) You just, unplug them all just like that,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,697660,699449,cause we don't need it anymore.
6oIlGhTgaKo,699450,702950,This one board will take over both functions because it uses
6oIlGhTgaKo,702950,705260,the power. And then I guess that's for the data.
6oIlGhTgaKo,705260,707030,So it's a pretty cool mod.
6oIlGhTgaKo,707030,709110,"I just realized after taking this one out,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,709110,711079,"this board actually has a ribbon for us,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,711080,713810,so I have to take the ribbon out of the main board.
6oIlGhTgaKo,713810,715710,So we're going to do that in a moment.
6oIlGhTgaKo,717260,718550,Seems fine.
6oIlGhTgaKo,718550,720089,"That looks like that's how you install it,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,720090,721653,so we're going to go with that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,722570,724590,I don't think I'm supposed to slide it into place.
6oIlGhTgaKo,724590,726210,- So they pop out and then you push them into lock.
6oIlGhTgaKo,726210,727150,"- Oh, okay."
6oIlGhTgaKo,727150,728050,- Yep. No problem.
6oIlGhTgaKo,728050,729890,So this needs to come off. This is the only one?
6oIlGhTgaKo,729890,731380,"- No, no, it's good. That's what we want to keep that."
6oIlGhTgaKo,731380,733171,"- Oh, okay. This one stays."
6oIlGhTgaKo,733171,734290,Yeah. That's a free tech tip.
6oIlGhTgaKo,734290,735928,All right. Let's get this graphics card...
6oIlGhTgaKo,735929,737929,(gasps)
6oIlGhTgaKo,739529,740570,I think it'll be okay though.
6oIlGhTgaKo,740570,743630,Because these hard drive cages shouldn't interfere.
6oIlGhTgaKo,743630,745880,There we go. All right.
6oIlGhTgaKo,745880,746916,Chase!
6oIlGhTgaKo,746916,747749,(Chase) Yup?
6oIlGhTgaKo,747749,749740,- How married to this case are you?
6oIlGhTgaKo,749740,751580,I'm a little concerned about cooling.
6oIlGhTgaKo,751580,755580,This is a solid front panel case. This is an RTX 3080.
6oIlGhTgaKo,755580,757517,I don't know if it's going to be up to the task.
6oIlGhTgaKo,757517,758653,"(Chase) If it's not, it's not."
6oIlGhTgaKo,758653,760400,- Okay we'll find out soon enough.
6oIlGhTgaKo,760400,761680,- I do really like the case.
6oIlGhTgaKo,761680,764540,"I had a really hope that we can use the computer in there,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,764540,766860,"but if it's too powerful, too much heat,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,766861,768320,"we'll have to swap it, but you know,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,768320,770110,that's a risk I'm willing to take at the moment.
6oIlGhTgaKo,770110,772510,"The board has been swapped, I'm just putting the"
6oIlGhTgaKo,772510,774150,metal plate back on.
6oIlGhTgaKo,774150,776940,I'm going to put in the rest of the screws and we should be
6oIlGhTgaKo,776940,777773,good to go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,777773,778700,- Now we can throw this puppy on here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,778700,780365,Thermal paste is already on and
6oIlGhTgaKo,780365,783200,I have confirmed these are correct.
6oIlGhTgaKo,783200,785440,Which means we're pretty much done.
6oIlGhTgaKo,785440,786310,It's on there pretty good.
6oIlGhTgaKo,786310,789370,I think this rig might actually be ready to boot up.
6oIlGhTgaKo,789370,791080,- The network adapters installed and
6oIlGhTgaKo,791080,792400,"the hard drive is inside,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,792400,795820,so all we got to do is plug in this memory card and boot it
6oIlGhTgaKo,795820,798010,up and we should find out if it's going to work or not.
6oIlGhTgaKo,798010,800750,- Aw that is sweet. PC gaming first.
6oIlGhTgaKo,800750,803130,"All right, let's see if it fires up."
6oIlGhTgaKo,803130,805570,"Look at that RGB, boys."
6oIlGhTgaKo,805570,806590,Ridiculous.
6oIlGhTgaKo,806590,808520,"Hey, there it is."
6oIlGhTgaKo,808520,809353,Nice.
6oIlGhTgaKo,809353,811241,"Okay, we've got the M.2,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,811241,813180,"we've got the two SATA SSDs,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,813180,814370,"we've got the hard drive,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,814370,816400,we've got our 16 gigs of Ram.
6oIlGhTgaKo,816400,821400,Everything looks like it is behaving as we would expect.
6oIlGhTgaKo,821450,822950,- Let's try the PS2 next.
6oIlGhTgaKo,822950,824430,"It's actually good that you plugged in the computer,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,824430,827199,because we do need to power the retro tank actually.
6oIlGhTgaKo,827199,828032,- Ayyy
6oIlGhTgaKo,828032,829615,- Free MCBoot there we go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,829615,830757,- Free MCBoot.
6oIlGhTgaKo,830757,832820,- We gotta get a game to install it. Right?
6oIlGhTgaKo,832820,833653,- Sure.
6oIlGhTgaKo,833653,835960,- All right. Disney Extreme Skate Adventure.
6oIlGhTgaKo,835960,837200,"Well, that's a top priority."
6oIlGhTgaKo,837200,838046,"Why don't we just,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,838046,838879,(Chase) That is 100% a top priority.
6oIlGhTgaKo,838879,840020,(Linus) Why don't we put this one on?
6oIlGhTgaKo,840020,841830,- I heard that transferring hard drive games can
6oIlGhTgaKo,841830,844420,"actually take a while if you do it directly on the PS2,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,844420,847029,"so we could be, we could just let it sit for a while."
6oIlGhTgaKo,847030,848850,"- So can you just pop the hard drive, throw it in"
6oIlGhTgaKo,848850,850860,"the computer, transfer everything and then put it"
6oIlGhTgaKo,850860,851693,back in there?
6oIlGhTgaKo,851693,852610,"- Yeah, you can totally do that."
6oIlGhTgaKo,852610,854350,I think that's what most people do.
6oIlGhTgaKo,854350,859350,"(Linus) Time left 388,140 hours. I mean, what even is that?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,860006,862000,"(Chase) It's just an estimation, don't worry about it."
6oIlGhTgaKo,862000,865440,"- 44 years. So Chase, by the time you're my age,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,865440,866450,it might have ripped.
6oIlGhTgaKo,866450,867303,(Chase) Nice.
6oIlGhTgaKo,868690,870810,- Ow. I stabbed my finger.
6oIlGhTgaKo,870810,873250,May I ask why you provided me with all of these
6oIlGhTgaKo,873250,876447,Pure Wings 2 120mm fans?
6oIlGhTgaKo,876447,877740,(Chase) Can you put them in the top?
6oIlGhTgaKo,877740,878925,- I can.
6oIlGhTgaKo,878925,879758,(Chase) Yes.
6oIlGhTgaKo,879758,880591,"- All right, I think I'm only going to"
6oIlGhTgaKo,880591,881680,"be able to put two in the top,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,881680,885317,but that's already going to be five fans in a Meshify case.
6oIlGhTgaKo,885317,888520,I don't know how effective this top exhaust is going to be.
6oIlGhTgaKo,888520,890810,It's right next to an intake.
6oIlGhTgaKo,890810,892983,And I'm going to move these 140s down.
6oIlGhTgaKo,892983,894633,"I think this plastic piece right here just,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,894633,896960,"yeah there we go, pops out."
6oIlGhTgaKo,896960,898830,"Since this machine is going to be running unraid,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,898830,900720,it's obviously going to have some hard drives in it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,900720,902290,We're going to want to make sure they get some cooling.
6oIlGhTgaKo,902290,905180,So we're just going to take this fan and give it a little
6oIlGhTgaKo,905180,906290,one of those.
6oIlGhTgaKo,906290,908339,- I just need to make a little bit more room for myself over
6oIlGhTgaKo,908340,911200,here so I can get the desk upright and take it apart a
6oIlGhTgaKo,911200,913753,little bit before we haul it out of here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,913753,915209,- Oookay.
6oIlGhTgaKo,915210,916400,"- Perfect, all right."
6oIlGhTgaKo,916400,917580,- Cool.
6oIlGhTgaKo,917580,919590,- And I will disassemble some of it. So
6oIlGhTgaKo,919590,922930,- Yeah do you remember when IKEA furniture was like.
6oIlGhTgaKo,922930,926070,This is a sick rig in its own rights. Sheesh.
6oIlGhTgaKo,926070,929210,Remind me to be your little brother growing up.
6oIlGhTgaKo,929210,931890,Cause like you're hand me downs man.
6oIlGhTgaKo,931890,934400,The couch goes here now. It's no less ugly.
6oIlGhTgaKo,934400,935910,At least it's the first thing you see when
6oIlGhTgaKo,935910,937259,you walk in the room.
6oIlGhTgaKo,937260,938573,- We lost one of the feet.
6oIlGhTgaKo,940940,942480,- Whoops.
6oIlGhTgaKo,942480,944193,"Here. Hold on, let me, whoa no no wait."
6oIlGhTgaKo,944193,945026,"- Whoa, whoa."
6oIlGhTgaKo,945026,946050,- Hold on. Hold on. Let me.
6oIlGhTgaKo,946050,947570,- I can't game if I lose my finger.
6oIlGhTgaKo,947570,948403,- Yeah.
6oIlGhTgaKo,949277,950810,Don't worry I got you fam.
6oIlGhTgaKo,950810,952591,"Wait, you can't game if you lose your fingers."
6oIlGhTgaKo,952591,953424,- Oh [Bleep].
6oIlGhTgaKo,953424,955606,"- Oh, here, here we go. Down it comes."
6oIlGhTgaKo,955606,956710,Okay.
6oIlGhTgaKo,956710,958870,"- Yeah. It has to come up a bit, but"
6oIlGhTgaKo,958870,962107,- I was going to say it's a little Linus sized.
6oIlGhTgaKo,962107,963607,(Chase) Yeah it can go higher.
6oIlGhTgaKo,964890,966600,"Perfect. You know, you got the TV,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,966600,967959,"Got your main desk, got the other desk."
6oIlGhTgaKo,967960,970470,"- Yeah, it's frickin' awesome."
6oIlGhTgaKo,970470,973180,"I mean, you might even be able to stream and"
6oIlGhTgaKo,973180,977141,like game on your PlayStation or whatever on the main TV.
6oIlGhTgaKo,977142,978320,"- Just tilt this bit, yeah."
6oIlGhTgaKo,978320,980160,"- Wait, why do all the consoles live over here?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,980160,982000,How do these go cconnect to the thing?
6oIlGhTgaKo,982000,983430,"- Well actually the switch, might move."
6oIlGhTgaKo,983430,986529,- You mean you might switch up its location?
6oIlGhTgaKo,986530,988190,"You know, you don't have to laugh at my jokes."
6oIlGhTgaKo,988190,989023,- To give you credit.
6oIlGhTgaKo,989023,990878,I didn't laugh at any of the others so far.
6oIlGhTgaKo,990878,993128,(laughter)
6oIlGhTgaKo,994250,997040,- Not sure if supposed to make me feel better or?
6oIlGhTgaKo,997040,999259,- Look at that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,999260,1000623,- The system works.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1002740,1003779,- We're a little high.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1003780,1004774,- Yeah? A little high?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1004774,1007399,- Yeah. Actually. I think that one's good.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1007400,1008233,- Which one?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1008233,1009470,- The one that you're doing right now.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1009470,1010891,- Yeah. Okay.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1010892,1011780,Ahh!
6oIlGhTgaKo,1011780,1014370,This is going to be a nightmare to level.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1014370,1016850,"- Right now, I'm installing the back plates on the monitors"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1016850,1021540,"because we have like a two, a dual monitor mounting arm,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1021540,1023329,so I can put that on the back of the desk and
6oIlGhTgaKo,1023330,1024850,I don't have to use traditional stands.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1024850,1026449,"It was a fairly cheap one off Amazon,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1026449,1027870,but it should do the job.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1027870,1029449,We made sure that it was rated for the
6oIlGhTgaKo,1029449,1030600,weight of the monitor.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1030600,1034289,"- If we don't have the little slidey mount things,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1034290,1036730,one option is to just 3d print them.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1036730,1038059,"Option number two,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1038060,1040880,we take this mesh cable management thing down here and we
6oIlGhTgaKo,1040880,1042105,just jam it in there.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1042105,1043059,(Chase) How about we do that?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1043060,1044480,"- Ah, hey."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1044480,1045340,"(Chase) I'm good, we're good."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1045340,1049190,"- Oh crap, the cable management's on this side."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1049191,1051020,(Chase) Yeah. Well we'll spin the desk around later.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1051020,1054010,I just realized that because we put the desk in wrong.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1054010,1057330,We can actually attach the monitor arm before we flip it
6oIlGhTgaKo,1057330,1059970,"around. So we're, we're actually good to go in this aspect."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1059970,1061220,- I'm on the StairMaster.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1063538,1065380,(Chase) Trying to slide it on and it doesn't want to go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1065380,1067310,This kind of juts out just enough.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1067310,1070400,"Take this off, put it on first, put the monitor on,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1070400,1071233,then screw it in.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1071233,1072710,How about you screw in the monitor
6oIlGhTgaKo,1072710,1074063,and I'll hold it in place.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1075080,1075913,Right?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1075913,1077559,- Brought my own LTT store screwdriver.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1077560,1078693,- Not yet coming soon.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1079630,1080808,- Whoa.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1080808,1081641,- Oop.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1081641,1082583,"- No, no, we good."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1083440,1084509,"Hey, rock on."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1084510,1085343,- Nice.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1085343,1087020,- Cool. This is great.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1087020,1088490,- Okay. We got to get the peels off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1088490,1089323,"I'm sorry, Andy."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1089323,1090230,"- Sorry, Andy."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1090230,1091669,How much was this? 50 bucks?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1091670,1094710,- Not even. Which could come back to haunt me in the future.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1094710,1095640,"- Oh yeah, for sure."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1095640,1097160,"- At the end of the day it was under budget,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1097160,1098230,so that's what had to happen.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1098230,1099658,Bring it forward a bit.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1099659,1100550,- Scooch it in.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1100550,1101430,"- Yeah, that's fine."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1101430,1102263,- Okay.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1102263,1103519,"- I probably, cause you know, I'm gaming,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1103520,1105280,I'll bring it pretty far forward.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1105280,1106810,"- Yeah, you got to go all pro."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1106810,1108720,- Why do you think my back posture is so bad.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1108720,1110590,- Now I'm all self-conscious about it too.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1110590,1112440,"Okay, I got the shoulders back, right?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1112440,1114419,"You like the thin mouse pad, eh?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1114420,1115660,- Do you know where that one came from?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1115660,1116860,- The office I assume?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1116860,1119840,- Yes. I had an exact same version of that
6oIlGhTgaKo,1119840,1121970,and the middle had started to worn out.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1121970,1123812,I just ended up getting the exact same one.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1123812,1125460,(Linus) But stolen from work.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1125460,1126740,"- No, we were giving them away."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1126740,1127573,"- Uh, huh."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1127573,1128406,It's amazing how many things
6oIlGhTgaKo,1128406,1129819,I give away without knowing about it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1129819,1130652,(Chase) This is sick.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1130652,1132190,The desktop is way cleaner than it used to be.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1132190,1133620,"- Oh yeah, for sure."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1133620,1135900,Where's the power adapter for the Samsung?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1135900,1138100,Wow that's a big power brick.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1138100,1139377,What the [Bleep]?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1139378,1141253,"(Chase) Well I got rid of two, so I'll take it."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1141253,1143800,- This is a hundred watt power adapter.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1143800,1145180,Ah!
6oIlGhTgaKo,1145180,1147763,"Oh, that was really close to falling on my face."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1149268,1150101,(Chase) It did!.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1150101,1151034,"- No, no it missed."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1151035,1151868,"(Chase) Oh, okay."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1151868,1153120,"- If you're going to have the computer in the corner here,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1153120,1154279,we need this leveled.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1154279,1155970,(Chase) All right. Give me one second.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1155970,1158381,"Yo dog. I heard you wanted a level, so I got you a level."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1158381,1159260,(Linus) Wow.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1159260,1161910,You leveled my level so I can level while I level.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1161910,1164410,Get on my level Chase. You know what?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1165510,1167920,It's not far off actually.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1167920,1170095,It could be different from one side of the table to the
6oIlGhTgaKo,1170095,1174000,other. This one has to come up for sure.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1174000,1175716,"There's some weight on the top of it, isn't there?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1175716,1176549,(Chase) Yeah.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1176549,1177929,"- That's fine. I can, yeah, there we go."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1177930,1179419,Okay. So is it level now?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1179419,1180648,(Chase) Still looks a little off.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1180649,1181499,(Linus) Okay. Oi!
6oIlGhTgaKo,1182576,1184910,"- No, it's all good, I just knocked something."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1184910,1188140,- Watch your feet. This thing will break your foot muscles.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1188140,1188973,Oh God!
6oIlGhTgaKo,1188973,1189940,- I think you broke the front.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1189940,1190773,You know what's funny?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1190773,1192370,"They warned us about that when we picked it up,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1192370,1194605,they said the front can break really easily.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1194605,1195933,"- Oh, I'm sorry."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1196873,1198440,(Chase) This thing is super old.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1198440,1200110,I'm really not that concerned.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1200110,1202520,I think that's the only thing you've broken and it's not as
6oIlGhTgaKo,1202520,1204273,bad as the bed. So I'm happy.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1204273,1205106,(Linus) Hup.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1205106,1205939,(metal clanging)
6oIlGhTgaKo,1205939,1208012,(yelling)
6oIlGhTgaKo,1208012,1211263,(Andy) Linus? Did you just break my bed?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1213290,1215830,- So I almost forgot. We have to remount a few things.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1215830,1218340,I have the camera we're going to use as a webcam.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1218340,1219793,And then the thing you place it on.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1219793,1221980,It's the Sony Alpha 5100.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1221980,1224891,It's clean HDMI and I can use a dummy battery.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1224891,1227630,"That's all I need. Something about it being mirrorless too,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1227630,1228900,"but I'm not a camera guy, so."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1228900,1230390,"I found it in a closet somewhere and I was like,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1230390,1232140,"hey, I could use this."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1232140,1234666,This cable management tray is doing wonders.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1234666,1235518,"(Linus) I know, right?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1235518,1236417,- Yeah.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1236417,1237480,(Linus) So much stuff jammed in there.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1237480,1239460,It looks so clean under the desk and you'll never
6oIlGhTgaKo,1239460,1242023,accidentally kick anything and knock it over or whatever.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1242023,1243380,"(Chase) Oh, is that for the monitor?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1243380,1245710,"- Yeah. It's a USB 3B,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1245710,1249563,but it's got this giant housing on it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1249563,1250913,"(Chase) Thank you, Samsung."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1252840,1255020,- We leave it like this forever.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1255020,1257110,I win our next gaming match.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1257110,1258410,"- Hold up, hold up, hold up."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1258410,1259640,- Everyone's happy.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1259640,1260820,- What's going on?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1260820,1262820,- That's so much better.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1262820,1265250,You can still see a little bit of jello though.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1265250,1267550,You can still see this one is a touch faster.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1267550,1269410,- At least one of the light bulbs is burnt out.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1269410,1272090,So I figured I'd just get some smart bulbs and replace them
6oIlGhTgaKo,1272090,1275159,"and get some RGB going. If it's not in the computer,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1275160,1276430,it'll be the entire room.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1276430,1277840,We have nano leaf essentials here.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1277840,1281690,"A19, or E26 they definitely fit in those sockets,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1281690,1285690,"so no problem. I think it was 35, each or something."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1285690,1286523,- 35 each?!
6oIlGhTgaKo,1287366,1290299,This is a hundred dollars in light bulbs per fixture.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1290300,1293230,- You got to go big for the upgrade. So here we are.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1293230,1294400,"- Oh, I think I got it."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1294400,1295310,- Yep. Yep.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1295310,1296930,How many LMG employees does it take to
6oIlGhTgaKo,1296930,1298190,screw in a light bulb?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1298190,1300539,(Linus) You had a gamersnexus modmat the whole time
6oIlGhTgaKo,1300540,1302540,and we didn't use it for a build surface?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1302540,1304010,- I like to live dangerously.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1304010,1307040,Another piece of equipment straight from Amazon.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1307040,1308840,Super cheap. Not sure if it's worth it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1308840,1311900,"Basically it has four inputs and two outputs,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1311900,1313650,but the outputs is duplicated.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1313650,1316700,So the idea is that one always goes to the CRT and then one
6oIlGhTgaKo,1316700,1318419,always goes to the capture card.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1318420,1320480,So it's just kind of a handy way to do that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1320480,1321809,And you can have four consoles.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1321810,1324442,- And we have no idea what the
6oIlGhTgaKo,1324442,1327520,AV quality of this thing is.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1327520,1328830,- I didn't want to spend a lot on it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1328830,1330919,I just wanted to see if it would work. Is that working?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1330920,1332463,- Nope. That's just the TV.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1332463,1334590,"(Chase) Oh, you know what? I know why."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1334590,1337344,I didn't plug in the audio to the back.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1337344,1338700,It's in the back of the TV.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1338700,1339543,- Got you fam.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1340520,1343624,Okay. Where is it at? Ow.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1343624,1345110,(Chase) Well it's under the desk now.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1345110,1345943,- I see that.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1347540,1348373,- Oh God.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1348373,1350180,- Oh wow. That's really loud.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1350180,1352910,It's kind of like an inverse color thing you got
6oIlGhTgaKo,1352910,1354970,going on the bottom right corner.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1354970,1356494,How much did I pay for this again?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1356494,1357610,(Chase) Like 150.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1357610,1360100,- The gamer vibe is real now.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1360100,1362740,"- This is looking pretty good. We're getting what, 70 FPS?"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1362740,1365179,- Yeah. Considering that you're running like
6oIlGhTgaKo,1365180,1366880,ray tracing ultimate.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1366880,1369240,- Do we want to turn it off and see what it goes to?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1369240,1370410,"- It's probably worthwhile, yeah."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1370410,1371574,"- Yeah, all right."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1371574,1372407,(Linus) There we go.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1372407,1375290,"- Yeah, 120. That's pretty good. Considering this game"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1375290,1378360,really just seems to cap out in like a low hundreds.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1378360,1379510,This is cool. You want to give it a shot?
6oIlGhTgaKo,1379510,1382350,- This is the part where we gain a greater appreciation
6oIlGhTgaKo,1382350,1385353,for how good Chase is as we watch me try to do it.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1387720,1390049,Where are you boys at? There's one.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1390050,1394220,"- Ooh, no, he was hiding. All right. That was. Pretty good."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1394220,1397530,- Chase didn't even mention that part of the plan here
6oIlGhTgaKo,1397530,1399660,is to have space for VR.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1399660,1402230,He's even got the headset already. This is awesome.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1402230,1404740,This is way better. And we didn't put the Displates
6oIlGhTgaKo,1404740,1408070,on the wall. These look awesome.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1408070,1408962,"- Yeah, not bad."
6oIlGhTgaKo,1408963,1410730,- Not bad at all.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1410730,1412580,We might've gone a little late on the shoot today.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1412580,1416230,The blueness of the shot is not just from the RGB lighting.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1416230,1418400,"It's also getting kind of dark outside,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1418400,1422210,"but I love this setup. It's gaming essentials,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1422210,1425669,and anything goes. You love your console gaming.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1425670,1428180,You love your PC gaming. Your modern gaming.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1428180,1429430,your retro gaming.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1429430,1433700,Chase has pretty much got you freaking covered.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1433700,1438620,"So thank you very much Intel for sponsoring this $5,000"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1438620,1440830,Extreme Tech Upgrade. Thanks to you guys for watching.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1440830,1443100,"If you're looking for another video to watch, hey,"
6oIlGhTgaKo,1443100,1445049,maybe check out one of our previous
6oIlGhTgaKo,1445050,1446280,Intel Extreme Tech Upgrades.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1446280,1449270,We alluded to that I had broken furniture on one of the
6oIlGhTgaKo,1449270,1450830,previous ones.
6oIlGhTgaKo,1450830,1453029,Maybe check out Andy's extreme tech upgrade.
