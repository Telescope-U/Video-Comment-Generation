tgx9QrRz6g8,219040,224959,myrcella she's going on a fancy boat for  a bridal shower back to the story my  husband and i have been together for  four years he did cheat on me when we
tgx9QrRz6g8,224959,231680,were boyfriend and girlfriend but i did  forgive him for that we were engaged for  about two years which in my book is a  very long time he kept putting off the
tgx9QrRz6g8,231680,236959,wedding and here was my mistake i gave  him an ultimatum we either got married  or we needed to break up i decided to
tgx9QrRz6g8,236959,242640,tell him the truth there were several  men in my life that were interested in  dating me i kept rejecting them because  i thought i was gonna get married to
tgx9QrRz6g8,242640,248720,this man and of course he got incredibly  jealous the next day we set a date for  our wedding fast forward to last year i
tgx9QrRz6g8,248720,255439,started to suspect that he was seeing  someone else i noticed that he started  hiding his phone from me and he would  always have it on do not disturb mode so
tgx9QrRz6g8,255439,261840,i started getting really suspicious of  course i started my own business online  and i was selling a lot of products  through my website so i decided to get
tgx9QrRz6g8,261840,267120,myself a new car after that he started  acting even stranger he would make  comments about how nice my car was and
tgx9QrRz6g8,267120,273520,that the least i could have done was  bought him one too there was no way i  was gonna buy him a car his behavior was  so odd one day he fell asleep on the
tgx9QrRz6g8,273520,280160,couch so i decided to look at his phone  that's when i found that he was hiding a  bunch of dating apps he had over 40  conversations on each app he was a
tgx9QrRz6g8,280160,283840,serial dater part two was up
tgx9QrRz6g8,285360,291280,story time about how my husband moved  his mistress into our home and is making  me pay for all the bills disclaimers now  my story time is that i'm on instagram
tgx9QrRz6g8,291280,296560,this is my beautiful sister you guys i'm  doing your makeup when i found all the  dating apps on my husband's phone i  quickly confronted him of course he
tgx9QrRz6g8,296560,302479,started to lie he told me his friends  downloaded all the dating apps on his  phone as a joke so i pulled up all the  conversations he had on the dating apps
tgx9QrRz6g8,302479,308800,and i started reading them to him that's  when he said that he was just testing it  out to see if he could find anybody as  an experiment well guess what i
tgx9QrRz6g8,308800,315039,questioned him for two hours by the end  of the two hours he told me the truth he  said that he had been dating a few women  and that he was only doing it because he
tgx9QrRz6g8,315039,321120,wasn't happy in the marriage that's when  i told him that he should have just told  me the truth because i've been wasting  all my time trying to be with him he  then swore to me up and down that he
tgx9QrRz6g8,321120,326240,would stop a few months later he was  acting strange again and this time i  decided to follow him the first day i
tgx9QrRz6g8,326240,331680,started following him i saw he went to  some girl's house knocked on her door  and i confronted them together my  husband told me he was in love part
tgx9QrRz6g8,331680,337520,three is a  story time about how my husband moved
tgx9QrRz6g8,337520,343520,his mistress into her home and is making  me pay for all the bills disclaimers is  not my start time i send me an instagram  after i knocked on her door and
tgx9QrRz6g8,343520,350160,confronted them my husband told me that  he fell in love it felt like someone had  kicked me in the chest i told him that i  just wanted to speak civilly so we all
tgx9QrRz6g8,350160,355360,sat down and spoke for five hours by the  end of those five hours my husband  somehow convinced me that the best thing
tgx9QrRz6g8,355360,361199,was for her to move into her home  apparently she had financial trouble and  her ex was stalking her my husband told  me that the best thing would be for all
tgx9QrRz6g8,361199,367759,of us to be in a relationship and that  that would make him happiest otherwise  he would want to get a divorce from me  so i felt like i had to agree so this
tgx9QrRz6g8,367759,374240,girl ended up moving into her house but  my husband decided to quit his job so  that he could take care of her because  of her crazy ex and he told me that i
tgx9QrRz6g8,374240,380880,was making enough money for the three of  us that's when i found myself having to  pay for all of our dinners our groceries  and rent after a few weeks i told him
tgx9QrRz6g8,380880,386240,that he and her needed to move out or  that they both needed to get a job  that's when he told me that i would be  putting both their lives in danger if i
tgx9QrRz6g8,386240,392080,made them get jobs because of her ex i  know i should just get a divorce but  somehow i think that this can be fixed i  need you guys to give me the strength to
tgx9QrRz6g8,392080,395840,divorce him help me out
tgx9QrRz6g8,397199,403199,story time about how i did the dirty  with my sister's boyfriend whoops  disclaimer isn't on my story time i sent  me an instagram my sister and i didn't
tgx9QrRz6g8,403199,408960,actually grow up together i grew up with  my dad and she mostly grew up with my  mom growing up we were really  competitive like in every single way but
tgx9QrRz6g8,408960,414560,for the most part we had each other's  backs she's a year older than me so we  weren't in the same grade i got bullied  a lot in high school and she always
tgx9QrRz6g8,414560,420319,defended me finally when we graduated  from high school our relationship got a  lot better we stopped competing in  everything and our parents actually got
tgx9QrRz6g8,420319,426639,back together this was the happiest  moment of our lives we were all living  under the same roof and my parents had  started a new business my sister and i
tgx9QrRz6g8,426639,432960,started helping them with their business  and it grew a lot we were financially  stable and we were even able to buy a  beach house every single weekend we
tgx9QrRz6g8,432960,438080,would go as a family and with friends  now when it came to boys we had the same  taste this unfortunately led us to have
tgx9QrRz6g8,438080,444240,a lot of fights she would meet a guy and  i would like him or i would meet a guy  and she would like him but we never  actively tried to steal each other's
tgx9QrRz6g8,444240,450240,boyfriends also our parents were really  strict so my sister and i had to go  behind their back to have boyfriends  when i turned 19 i met this really sweet
tgx9QrRz6g8,450240,455919,guy we fell in love i thought we were  gonna get married my parents were  totally against me having a boyfriend  but i told them that i was old enough to
tgx9QrRz6g8,455919,462400,make my own decisions the only person  who actually really supported me was my  sister she was able to convince my  parents to accept him so they did he
tgx9QrRz6g8,462400,468400,would come over and have dinner with us  it would go out on dates and eventually  he asked my parents for my hand in  marriage but my parents said no they
tgx9QrRz6g8,468400,475440,said i was too young so he ended up  breaking up with me which was really bad  then my sister met a guy part two is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,477520,482800,part two of how i did the journey with  my sister's boyfriend and should i tell  her disclaimer is not my story time is  sending me on instagram so after my
tgx9QrRz6g8,482800,488479,boyfriend broke up with me i was really  heartbroken this was around the time  that my sister met her boyfriend the one  that i did it with they started dating
tgx9QrRz6g8,488479,494720,really casually and he made it clear to  her that he did not want to be in a  relationship with her my parents did not  like that at all so basically he was not
tgx9QrRz6g8,494720,500000,allowed to come to our house whatsoever  and the thing is i never even saw his  face my sister showed me his instagram
tgx9QrRz6g8,500000,505280,but he didn't really have a lot of  pictures of himself i didn't even know  what his face looked like after a few  weeks i told my parents that i wanted to
tgx9QrRz6g8,505280,510319,start dating people and they were so  against this like i said my parents are  really strict so here's what i did i
tgx9QrRz6g8,510319,516159,signed up to a bunch of dating apps and  i just started going on dates behind  their back and i know that i'm 19 but i  still respected everything my parents
tgx9QrRz6g8,516159,522800,told me because i lived under the roof  so i started going on a bunch of dates  and can you guess who i ended up  matching with yep my sister's boyfriend
tgx9QrRz6g8,522800,528800,although i didn't know it was her  boyfriend at the time he and i ended up  going on two dates it was amazing it was  wonderful it was great he was super
tgx9QrRz6g8,528800,535200,charming and really funny and i did ask  him if he was seeing other people and he  said no but of course that was a total  lie i even talked to my sister about
tgx9QrRz6g8,535200,541519,this guy i mean how sick is that so  here's what ended up happening he and i  go back to his place and we do it the  next day he totally ghosts me and this
tgx9QrRz6g8,541519,545200,is when i started investigating part  three is uh
tgx9QrRz6g8,547040,552959,part three of how i did the dirty with  my sister's boyfriend and should i tell  her disclaimer is not my story time to  send me an instagram after he goes to me
tgx9QrRz6g8,552959,558399,i started doing some investigating this  is when i found his real instagram and  guess who i see on it my sister is
tgx9QrRz6g8,558399,563839,tagged in his pictures as his girlfriend  i was totally heartbroken honestly i  really fell for this guy he seemed like
tgx9QrRz6g8,563839,568959,a really good guy but of course they all  do right and talk about how good of a  liar he was on our dates all he kept
tgx9QrRz6g8,568959,574880,talking about was how he wanted to be  with somebody and how he really wanted  to settle down and live with someone  it's like he was saying exactly what he
tgx9QrRz6g8,574880,579920,knew i wanted to hear so here's what i  did i reported him on the dating app and  then i sent him a dm on his real
tgx9QrRz6g8,579920,586240,instagram and i sent him a picture of me  and my sister aka his girlfriend he  messaged me right away he said that he
tgx9QrRz6g8,586240,591839,had just started dating my sister and  that he didn't know we were related  that's when i told him i knew he was  lying they had been dating for a while
tgx9QrRz6g8,591839,598080,now this guy really thought i was that  stupid to believe him that he had just  started dating my sister and of course  he blocked me like the coward he is
tgx9QrRz6g8,598080,604240,honestly i don't know how to tell my  sister because i feel like she might  think it was my fault also if my parents  find out they will kill me i asked my
tgx9QrRz6g8,604240,610160,sister what was up with her boyfriend  that's when she told me that he hadn't  been texting her for like two days it's  been a week now and he's been ghosting
tgx9QrRz6g8,610160,615440,her every single day i know i should  tell my sister but how do i even start  also i know she's gonna tell my parents
tgx9QrRz6g8,615440,621040,i'm terrified what the heck am i gonna  do now should i tell my mom that my  stepdad is putting the moves on me aka
tgx9QrRz6g8,621040,626800,her husband disclaimer is not my story  time my mom and i have always had a  really good relationship she's pretty  much been my best friend all throughout
tgx9QrRz6g8,626800,632959,my life i was bullied heavily in school  so i always confided in my mom i mean i  tell my mom everything even about boys
tgx9QrRz6g8,632959,639120,when i was in high school my parents got  divorced right after the divorce my mom  had set her sights on this one guy he  lived in our neighborhood was single and
tgx9QrRz6g8,639120,645600,had a lot of money now you could say my  mom wanted his money or you could say  that she fell in love with him i'm not  sure which one they ended up getting
tgx9QrRz6g8,645600,652240,married right when i turned 17. my mom  and i moved into his house and it was  amazing it was actually more like a  mansion he had a pool a movie theater
tgx9QrRz6g8,652240,658320,and a tennis court so my house was the  house that all my friends would come to  and my mom was really happy i could tell  but there were a few things that i
tgx9QrRz6g8,658320,664000,didn't like about my new step dad for  example whenever my friends would come  over he would always try to hang out  with us first i thought it was just
tgx9QrRz6g8,664000,669040,really annoying but after a year of this  happening i realized it was actually  kind of gross so i opened up to my mom
tgx9QrRz6g8,669040,675120,and i told her that i didn't like him  hanging around my friends and my mom  laid the hammer down after that he would  not come around at all whenever my
tgx9QrRz6g8,675120,683040,friends and i were downstairs here's  where things start to get a little icky  when i turn 19 i could tell he was  staring at me more and more part two was
tgx9QrRz6g8,684880,691440,did i tell my mom that my stepdad her  husband is trying to hit on me this  camera is not my story time is something  else to grom when i turn 19 is when i
tgx9QrRz6g8,691440,697200,started noticing that he would stare at  me more and more i usually would walk  around the house in my bikini whenever i  was gonna go in the pool sometimes i
tgx9QrRz6g8,697200,702959,would wear shorts and crop tops around  the house or be in a sports bra on  leggings whenever i was working out but  his staring clearly made me
tgx9QrRz6g8,702959,708480,uncomfortable so i literally had to  change the way that i dressed and i  didn't want to tell my mom just because  i thought maybe i was reading too much
tgx9QrRz6g8,708480,714320,into it instead i told my best friend  and when i told my best friend she told  me that i needed to be really careful  around him she told me i shouldn't even
tgx9QrRz6g8,714320,719519,be alone with him in the house i started  to get really really paranoid one day my  stepdad asked me why i stopped dressing
tgx9QrRz6g8,719519,724880,the way that i used to point blank i  said to him well you stare a lot and it  makes me uncomfortable the smile on his
tgx9QrRz6g8,724880,730880,face turned into pure anger then he  started calling me stupid and ignorant  he said that i was dumb for thinking  that and that he was totally in love
tgx9QrRz6g8,730880,736800,with my mom and that he would never ever  see me that way he continued to stare at  me a few months later we decided to have  a party on my mom's birthday well my
tgx9QrRz6g8,736800,742639,stepdad got hammered and when no one was  looking he sat down next to me and put  his hand on my lap that's when he said  that he missed the way that i used to
tgx9QrRz6g8,742639,747920,dress and the look on his face was  disgusting part three is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,750639,756720,should i tell my mom that my stepdad has  been hitting on me aka her husband okay  man it's not my story time to send me an  instagram when he put his hand on my lap
tgx9QrRz6g8,756720,762079,i pushed him away and told him he was  being disgusting that's when he grabbed  my hand and told me that there was  nothing wrong with him appreciating my
tgx9QrRz6g8,762079,768160,beauty and remember we're at my mom's  birthday party i went over to my mom  with the intention to tell her but she  was having so much fun and it was her
tgx9QrRz6g8,768160,774399,birthday i didn't want to spoil it for  the rest of the night i had to avoid him  would follow me everywhere and try to  grab my hand i finally went up to my
tgx9QrRz6g8,774399,781040,bedroom and locked myself in there a few  days after the party he came up to me  and said i need to apologize to you and  i said what for that's when he said you
tgx9QrRz6g8,781040,787279,know why then he told me he made  reservations at a really nice restaurant  for us to go to and of course i said no  that's when he told me that we were both
tgx9QrRz6g8,787279,793839,adults that we could hang out together  when my mom wasn't around i said no and  i've been avoiding him since then but i  think avoiding him is doing the opposite
tgx9QrRz6g8,793839,801360,he now started sending me gym selfies i  told him he needed to stop and he said  he just wanted to send me his progress  that i could be proud of him ew never i
tgx9QrRz6g8,801360,807360,decided that i should move out and i  started looking for my own apartment i  thought maybe i should wait until i move  out to tell my mom or maybe not tell her
tgx9QrRz6g8,807360,813360,at all no this is gonna break her heart  and flip her world upside down he has a  really comfy life with him but i don't  think that's worth losing me right how
tgx9QrRz6g8,813360,818399,should i tell my mom my biggest fear is  that she doesn't believe me what should  i do
tgx9QrRz6g8,820720,827920,story time about how i married my blind  date after knowing each other for two  weeks after i broke up with my ex who  cheated on me four times i swear off men
tgx9QrRz6g8,827920,834399,but my friends and family were  constantly telling me that i should at  least try dating other people i went two  full years without dating anyone and it
tgx9QrRz6g8,834399,839680,was the best decision i ever made  instead of going out on dates i decided  to take that time to work on myself i
tgx9QrRz6g8,839680,846240,prioritized myself and started doing the  things that i've always wanted to do for  example i always wanted to learn how to  play the piano so i put myself into
tgx9QrRz6g8,846240,851760,piano classes i also started taking  belly dancing classes and i signed up to  pilates i also decided to focus on my
tgx9QrRz6g8,851760,856959,mental health because i realized that i  always depended on validation from men  was the happiest i'd ever been my family
tgx9QrRz6g8,856959,863040,even saw the changes in me and my mom  told me that maybe it was time for me to  start dating last year my sister signed  up to a bunch of dating apps and she
tgx9QrRz6g8,863040,868160,actually met some really good men i  really thought about it long and hard  and i decided to sign up for one too and
tgx9QrRz6g8,868160,874240,i told myself that i would take it slow  and easy finally i went on my first date  it didn't go very well because my date
tgx9QrRz6g8,874240,879920,only talked about himself and didn't ask  me any questions but then my second date  was this amazing guy and i kid you not
tgx9QrRz6g8,879920,884760,it was love at first sight part two is  up
tgx9QrRz6g8,885920,890959,part two of how i married my blind date  after knowing each other for only two  weeks so i walk into the restaurant and
tgx9QrRz6g8,890959,896560,i know what he looks like he was already  sitting at the table but as soon as we  locked eyes it was instant attraction
tgx9QrRz6g8,896560,901760,but not just attraction it was love i  honestly don't know how to describe it  it was this feeling i'd never felt
tgx9QrRz6g8,901760,908560,before when i sat down at the table we  instantly connected we talked about  everything from our childhoods up until
tgx9QrRz6g8,908560,914560,that point we talked about school  friends even our favorite foods favorite  colors places we wanted to visit i'm
tgx9QrRz6g8,914560,919680,talking about everything we even talked  about our family problems which i had  never done that with anyone else we
tgx9QrRz6g8,919680,925199,basically ordered the entire menu and  over the next five hours we talked and  ate and laughed you know when there's
tgx9QrRz6g8,925199,930880,moments of silence in a conversation and  sometimes it's awkward there was none of  that we were constantly talking and
tgx9QrRz6g8,930880,937120,asking each other questions the  restaurant actually had to tell us to go  home when we said goodbye he asked me if  he could take me to breakfast the next
tgx9QrRz6g8,937120,943120,day and of course i said yes as i was  driving home i knew that this was the  guy i wanted to marry for the next week
tgx9QrRz6g8,943120,948480,we hung out almost every single day when  we weren't working and we texted each  other day and night he would send me
tgx9QrRz6g8,948480,953519,paragraphs by the end of the week he  asked me if he could meet my parents we  had a wonderful dinner and my parents
tgx9QrRz6g8,953519,958800,loved him he put so much effort into  talking to them and even brought them  gifts the following day i met his family
tgx9QrRz6g8,958800,966680,and they love me too following monday he  asked me to move in with him and i said  yes part three is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,968240,975040,part three of how i married my blind  date after only knowing each other for  two weeks after one week of knowing each  other he asked me to move in like i said
tgx9QrRz6g8,975040,981120,my parents loved him but when i told him  that we were gonna move in together  after knowing each other for one week  they thought it was a terrible idea but
tgx9QrRz6g8,981120,986399,there was no way i was backing out on  moving in with him i told him that this  was a risk i was willing to take i was a
tgx9QrRz6g8,986399,991839,grown adult so i had the final word that  very same week i started moving all my  stuff in after living together for three
tgx9QrRz6g8,991839,997839,days we were having so much fun i was  living with my best friend we would tell  each other everything we decided to host
tgx9QrRz6g8,997839,1003040,a dinner for our family and friends his  family got along really well with my  family and his friends ended up loving
tgx9QrRz6g8,1003040,1009680,me by the end of that second week my  boyfriend was talking about getting  married and i said it would be a dream  to marry him and guess what the next day
tgx9QrRz6g8,1009680,1014880,he takes me out for an early breakfast  while we're sitting at the restaurant  the server brings over a box and he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1014880,1020320,tells me to open it and inside was a  beautiful emerald ring i had told him on  our first date that emeralds were my
tgx9QrRz6g8,1020320,1026880,favorite stones he got down on one knee  and asked me to marry him and i said yes  in order to avoid having to convince our
tgx9QrRz6g8,1026880,1032558,families we went straight to the court  and got married the following day yes i  know it's totally crazy but i am so
tgx9QrRz6g8,1032558,1038000,happy we've been married now for three  years we've traveled to eight different  countries and we also decided to have
tgx9QrRz6g8,1038000,1043280,children i never thought i would marry  the man of my dreams after two weeks of  knowing him but my risk paid off what
tgx9QrRz6g8,1043280,1046640,should we name our first baby
tgx9QrRz6g8,1048960,1054080,should i confess to my boyfriend that  i'm cheating on him with his dad my  boyfriend and i have been dating for  three years i have to admit our
tgx9QrRz6g8,1054080,1060400,relationship is pretty boring he's not  the most fun guy and he doesn't really  ever make me laugh a lot on the other  hand i'm always making him laugh i put
tgx9QrRz6g8,1060400,1066480,all those things aside because he is a  very good person and he does take care  of me his job requires him to be away  from work for six to eight months he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1066480,1072160,works on a boat so this means i have a  lot of time to myself no i never cheated  on him before his dad came along but let
tgx9QrRz6g8,1072160,1077200,me explain my boyfriend did not grow up  with his dad his dad went to prison a  long time ago for something he stole but
tgx9QrRz6g8,1077200,1083039,no it wasn't something terrible when his  dad got out of prison my boyfriend was  already 20 years old my boyfriend didn't  like the idea of his dad coming to live
tgx9QrRz6g8,1083039,1089360,with him and his mom so they had a lot  of fights but his dad made every effort  to try to make his son comfortable the  first time i met my dad's boyfriend i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1089360,1094880,noticed that he was very good looking he  was also in amazing shape he loves to  read books and listen to music and he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1094880,1100640,even started his own business as soon as  he got out of prison which is already  doing well he told my boyfriend to quit  his job and to work for him but my
tgx9QrRz6g8,1100640,1106400,boyfriend refused so my boyfriend had to  go away for his job which meant he was  going to be away for six months during  this time i decided to visit his mom as
tgx9QrRz6g8,1106400,1112480,much as i could so that she wouldn't get  lonely and this is when things started  heating up with his dad part two is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,1115120,1120640,should i confess to my boyfriend that  i'm cheating on him with his dad when my  boyfriend left for work for six months i  started going to visit his mom and his
tgx9QrRz6g8,1120640,1126960,dad every single week his mom and dad  were still married but they were not  together so it's not like the dad had to  be loyal to the mom my boyfriend's mom
tgx9QrRz6g8,1126960,1132960,would usually cook dinner i would eat  with her and then i would sit down to  watch a movie with her sometimes his dad  would sometimes join us but not all the
tgx9QrRz6g8,1132960,1138400,time like i mentioned my wife's dad is  very good looking he caught me staring  at him a few times and i'll admit i was
tgx9QrRz6g8,1138400,1144160,really embarrassed but at the same time  i kinda didn't care one night when i was  watching a movie with her she told me  that she was gonna go to bed i told her
tgx9QrRz6g8,1144160,1149919,i would go home but then she said no she  told me i should stay to finish watching  the movie that's when my boyfriend's dad  comes over and sits on the couch with me
tgx9QrRz6g8,1149919,1156400,and he says i'll keep you company as we  were watching the movie i could feel the  tension and i loved it i hadn't felt
tgx9QrRz6g8,1156400,1162400,anything like this in the whole time  that i was with my boyfriend i mean my  boyfriend and i rarely even kissed when  the movie finished i got up and turned
tgx9QrRz6g8,1162400,1168960,the television off he also gets up from  the couch that's when he grabbed my hand  and turned me around he grabbed my face  and started kissing me and i have to
tgx9QrRz6g8,1168960,1174720,admit i loved it he pulled me into a  corner and we kept kissing for a few  minutes that's when he asked me if i  wanted to go upstairs with him and i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1174720,1181200,said yes and we did it and it was  actually amazing yes i did feel guilty  but i wanted to live my life and enjoy
tgx9QrRz6g8,1181200,1186320,these moments and unfortunately my  boyfriend just didn't give that to me we  were inseparable after that part three
tgx9QrRz6g8,1186320,1192400,is up  should i confess to my boyfriend that
tgx9QrRz6g8,1192400,1198720,i'm cheating on him with his dad after  we did the you know what my boyfriend's  dad and i were inseparable he would come  over to my apartment almost every single
tgx9QrRz6g8,1198720,1205280,night and just sleep over and this  became a routine it's like we couldn't  keep our hands off each other and we  loved it and not once did we ever talk
tgx9QrRz6g8,1205280,1210480,about my boyfriend his son this went on  the entire time my boyfriend was gone a  few days before my boyfriend arrived his
tgx9QrRz6g8,1210480,1216720,dad and i decided that we would just try  to stay away from each other when he was  home well let me tell you it didn't last  very long my boyfriend came home and i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1216720,1221840,felt nothing it was just like before he  left he barely even kissed me and we  went back to our regular life so i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1221840,1227120,called his dad up and we started meeting  in different fancy hotels around the  city it was so fun and exciting after a
tgx9QrRz6g8,1227120,1233840,few weeks i noticed that my boyfriend  really changed he was barely touching me  and didn't really want anything to do  with me so i confronted him and i know i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1233840,1240080,have no right but i wanted to find out  what was going on my boyfriend told me  that he felt our relationship with stale  and i told him that i agreed that's when
tgx9QrRz6g8,1240080,1246559,he told me that we should separate but  we're technically still together now  here's my problem i think i just want to  break up with my boyfriend but i want to
tgx9QrRz6g8,1246559,1253200,get with his dad as in make it official  but his dad told me that he would never  make it official with me so now i'm  stuck i really like him and i have so
tgx9QrRz6g8,1253200,1259200,much fun with him also should i just  tell my boyfriend the truth what do you  guys think i should do storytime about  how my boss confessed to me that he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1259200,1265440,likes me and now he's pressuring me to  go out with him disclaimers in all my  storytelling send me on instagram i've  been working at my job for six months
tgx9QrRz6g8,1265440,1270720,now ever since i started my boss has  been very very nice to me if he gets  himself coffee he usually brings me one
tgx9QrRz6g8,1270720,1276320,and he always offers to buy me my lunch  of course i usually say no because i  always bring my lunch with me and also i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1276320,1283120,just think it's weird that he's always  offering several times i caught him  staring at me and he would offer to do  random things like walk me to my car in
tgx9QrRz6g8,1283120,1289039,other words he was showing a lot of  interest at first i just wanted to  believe that he was just a really nice  guy and i noticed that he wasn't that
tgx9QrRz6g8,1289039,1294159,way with anyone else except for me so  anytime that he would offer to do  something for me or if he would bring me
tgx9QrRz6g8,1294159,1299360,coffee i made sure to say thank you and  seem grateful i told my boyfriend about  my boss and my boyfriend was convinced
tgx9QrRz6g8,1299360,1305840,that my boss liked me he told me i  shouldn't be as nice as i was but i  didn't want to seem ungrateful or rude a  few weeks ago we had an office party of
tgx9QrRz6g8,1305840,1312400,course my boyfriend came along with me  and everything was fine everyone brought  their husbands and wives including my  boss by the way his wife is super
tgx9QrRz6g8,1312400,1318960,beautiful and really nice she even had  the party catered by one of the best  restaurants in town as my boyfriend and  i were heading home he turns to me and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1318960,1325200,tells me your boss definitely likes you  i asked him why he thought that and he  said that my boss couldn't stop staring  at me the whole night that's when my
tgx9QrRz6g8,1325200,1332120,boyfriend insisted that i should just  quit we got into a huge argument that  night part two is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,1333600,1339360,story time about how my boss confessed  to me that he likes me and now he's  pressuring me to date him part two my  boyfriend told me that my boss had been
tgx9QrRz6g8,1339360,1345039,staring at me the whole night then he  started insisting that i should just  quit my job we basically fought the  entire night i told him i would never
tgx9QrRz6g8,1345039,1350799,quit my job and that my boss was  harmless but it turns out that my  boyfriend was right when i went back to  work my boss started asking me a lot of
tgx9QrRz6g8,1350799,1355919,questions about my boyfriend he asked me  how long we'd been together if the  relationship was serious if we lived
tgx9QrRz6g8,1355919,1361280,together we tried to make it seem casual  the fifth question i asked my boss if he  was okay and he laughs and says i just
tgx9QrRz6g8,1361280,1368159,want to make sure you got a good guy  with you but he sounded so jealous  instead a few days later i caught my  boss staring at me again and this time i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1368159,1373200,got really annoyed i stared back at him  and waved that's when he waved back and  smiled at me at the end of the day he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1373200,1379360,offered to walk me to my car and i said  yes as we were walking in my car he  starts telling me that he thought i  looked really pretty at the party and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1379360,1386080,that he wanted to confess that he  couldn't stop staring at me all night  that's when i turned to him and i said  yeah my boyfriend noticed he responds
tgx9QrRz6g8,1386080,1392320,well your boyfriend's very lucky to be  with you and that i was clearly asking  for attention with the dress that i wore  by the way my dress was a long sleeve
tgx9QrRz6g8,1392320,1399120,turtleneck that went below my knees  that's when he says there's nothing  wrong with a little flirtation part 3 is  up
tgx9QrRz6g8,1401520,1406720,story time about how my boss confessed  to me that he likes me and now he's  pressuring me into dating him after he  told me that there was nothing wrong
tgx9QrRz6g8,1406720,1412880,with us flirting told him it was totally  inappropriate and that i didn't feel  comfortable with that he then laughed  and said you'll loosen up eventually i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1412880,1418000,went home and i told my boyfriend  everything my boyfriend went berserk he  started insisting that i quit again told
tgx9QrRz6g8,1418000,1423919,him i could handle the situation that my  boss was not going to do anything to me  then got so mad that he actually left to  his parents house he told me he would
tgx9QrRz6g8,1423919,1429840,come back to live with me after i quit  but here's the thing if the tables were  turned i would never ask my boyfriend to  quit his job because his boss was
tgx9QrRz6g8,1429840,1435840,flirting with him i love my job and i  don't think it's fair that i have to  quit because my boss is flirting with me  instead i decided that i would go back
tgx9QrRz6g8,1435840,1441279,to work and simply ignore my boss but  this actually had the opposite effect my  boss started coming on to me even
tgx9QrRz6g8,1441279,1447279,stronger he came up to me while i was  having lunch and asked me if i was  ignoring him i was honest and said yes a  little that's when he told me that we
tgx9QrRz6g8,1447279,1452559,should talk after work walk me to my car  and on the way he told me that he likes  me and that he's liked me since the day
tgx9QrRz6g8,1452559,1459279,i started working there he even said  that it's pretty much the only reason  why i got the job but then of course he  complimented me on all my work as he was
tgx9QrRz6g8,1459279,1465360,saying all of this i just stayed quiet i  really didn't know how to respond that's  when my boss tells me that we should go  on a date and that we could have a
tgx9QrRz6g8,1465360,1471760,fruitful relationship i love my job so  much i'm actually considering saying yes  to at least one date my boyfriend is
tgx9QrRz6g8,1471760,1476960,still not talking to me by the way now  my boss even sends me text messages  telling me how good i look in the office
tgx9QrRz6g8,1476960,1483279,and no i can't report him to anybody and  i don't want to jeopardize my job last  week my boss even gave me a raise and to
tgx9QrRz6g8,1483279,1489440,be honest i'm really happy about it my  dream is to buy myself a house but at  what cost should i say yes to just one
tgx9QrRz6g8,1489440,1495440,date or should i say no and suffer the  consequences or should i quit but that's  not fair either what do you guys think i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1495440,1498600,should do
tgx9QrRz6g8,1500880,1506240,is it okay that my boyfriend is trying  to convince me to let him do the journey  with my cousin my boyfriend used to be  my sneaky link before we made it
tgx9QrRz6g8,1506240,1512320,official at the beginning neither of us  wanted a relationship but the more we  kept hooking up the more we wanted to be  with each other so naturally we hung out
tgx9QrRz6g8,1512320,1518640,all the time and he asked me to be his  girlfriend and of course i really wanted  him to ask me but i would never bring it  up myself so when he finally did i said
tgx9QrRz6g8,1518640,1524159,yes but here's the thing my boyfriend  asked me if we could have an open  relationship when we started at first i  said no but then i thought about it some
tgx9QrRz6g8,1524159,1530240,more if he wants to see other girls and  cheat on me he will and because of the  way we started i knew what he was like  so i thought to myself it's probably
tgx9QrRz6g8,1530240,1537279,better to just have an open relationship  than to be wondering if he's cheating on  me so after a few weeks of me asking him  i said yes but i laid down some rules if
tgx9QrRz6g8,1537279,1542960,he was gonna hook up with somebody else  he needed to tell me he kept telling me  that it was better to just not talk  about it but i told him i wanted to know
tgx9QrRz6g8,1542960,1548960,the truth a few months into the  relationship everything was fine  according to him he was not hooking up  with anybody and i know that i wasn't
tgx9QrRz6g8,1548960,1554240,either even though the option was there  if we both wanted to this is around the  time that my cousin came home to visit
tgx9QrRz6g8,1554240,1559440,from college growing up everyone thought  that her and i were identical twins we  really do look so much alike we both
tgx9QrRz6g8,1559440,1564880,have the same exact body type really  similar features we both have long black  hair and we even dress the same so it's
tgx9QrRz6g8,1564880,1570400,natural that people thought we were  sisters i told my cousin about my  boyfriend and she wanted to meet him so  i had a dinner at my place as soon as my
tgx9QrRz6g8,1570400,1576480,boyfriend saw her he basically started  drooling it made me so angry but i had  to keep my cool throughout the dinner my  boyfriend kept complimenting her he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1576480,1581679,talked about how much her and i looked  alike and how it would be any guy's  fantasy to watch us do it my cousin was
tgx9QrRz6g8,1581679,1586720,super uncomfortable so i asked him to  stop doing that part two is uh
tgx9QrRz6g8,1588640,1594000,is it okay that my boyfriend is trying  to convince me to let him do the dirty  with my cousin because we have an open  relationship he feels like he can do
tgx9QrRz6g8,1594000,1600320,certain things in front of me for  example like flirting with other women  in front of me while we were having  dinner with my cousin who was visiting  he kept making comments about how hot
tgx9QrRz6g8,1600320,1606799,she was and how her and i look exactly  like twins my cousin was clearly super  uncomfortable so i asked him to stop  which he did that's when my boyfriend
tgx9QrRz6g8,1606799,1612400,dragged me into her bedroom and asked me  if he could do it with her i said  absolutely not one of the rules in our  open relationship is that we can't
tgx9QrRz6g8,1612400,1617600,choose anybody we already know he told  me that he technically did not know my  cousin i told him family was off limits
tgx9QrRz6g8,1617600,1623120,he asked me to think about it i drove my  cousin home and that's when she told me  that my boyfriend was really hot and i  was shocked i thought she was
tgx9QrRz6g8,1623120,1629279,uncomfortable at dinner i pulled the car  over and asked her if she was interested  in him that's when she said she  overheard our conversation yep she heard
tgx9QrRz6g8,1629279,1634559,when my boyfriend was asking me if he  could do it with her she started to  laugh and told me that it was okay and  that she wouldn't tell my parents then
tgx9QrRz6g8,1634559,1641120,she told me that an open relationship is  always a bad idea and that nothing good  will come of it i asked her again if she  was interested in him and she said maybe
tgx9QrRz6g8,1641120,1651539,she says you should just let us do it  part three is up  [Music]

tgx9QrRz6g8,1691760,1697200,over at her and i said are you crazy and  she said if you guys already have an  open relationship what's the difference  i told her i wasn't going to be
tgx9QrRz6g8,1697200,1702640,comfortable with her and my boyfriend  doing it and that she needed to get that  idea out of her head then she started  trying to do reverse psychology on me
tgx9QrRz6g8,1702640,1708640,she said if i didn't let them do it that  he was going to eventually resent me and  that he would see me as the bad guy and  that he'd probably start looking for
tgx9QrRz6g8,1708640,1714880,other girls i could not believe that my  own cousin was trying to do that to me i  started to cry and i asked her if she  loved me at all he then hugged me and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1714880,1720640,says of course i love you this is the  best thing for your relationship part of  me started to actually believe what she  was saying i thought maybe he will
tgx9QrRz6g8,1720640,1726559,resent me if i don't let them do it  after that i didn't talk to my cousin  for a few days during that time all my  boyfriend did was ask me if he could see
tgx9QrRz6g8,1726559,1731600,her again i made the mistake of telling  him that my cousin was down and then he  started pushing even more he promised me
tgx9QrRz6g8,1731600,1737520,he would only do it with her once and  that nothing would change between him  and i here's the other thing there's a  guy who's always asked me out on dates
tgx9QrRz6g8,1737520,1742960,but i always say no he contacted me and  told me that he was finally single and  that he really wants to see me i told my  boyfriend that if he was gonna do it
tgx9QrRz6g8,1742960,1749200,with my cousin then i could do it with  this guy that's what my boyfriend said  no because i had feelings for this guy  he's arguing that he has no feelings for
tgx9QrRz6g8,1749200,1755520,my cousin and that if i do it with this  other guy it would be like cheating  because i do have feelings for him which  is true i don't know what to do and i am
tgx9QrRz6g8,1755520,1761840,so confused i could just go behind my  boyfriend's back but part of me feels  guilty what should i do
tgx9QrRz6g8,1764000,1770799,is it okay that my boyfriend insists on  me washing myself before any sexy time  my boyfriend and i have been together  for six months but we've broken up four
tgx9QrRz6g8,1770799,1776559,times all together we've probably only  spent about three months together he  pursued me really hard we met at work
tgx9QrRz6g8,1776559,1783120,and the first day we met he asked me out  i kept saying no because i really don't  want to focus on guys right now i have a  really good career in fashion so dating
tgx9QrRz6g8,1783120,1788480,was not in my plans kept on insisting  and doing very nice things for me like  he would bring me my favorite coffee or
tgx9QrRz6g8,1788480,1793600,bring me my favorite foods i finally  said yes when he bought me a basket full  of my favorite snacks from whole foods
tgx9QrRz6g8,1793600,1799440,he told me that he basically went around  asking everyone what they saw me eating  and then he went to whole foods and  bought everything and made a basket for
tgx9QrRz6g8,1799440,1805120,me i was really flattered so when he  asked me out again i said yes i thought  maybe he'd be a really really kind and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1805120,1811120,just considerate guy but things are not  like that we went on a total of five  dates before anything happened when it
tgx9QrRz6g8,1811120,1816480,finally came time to doing it we were at  my apartment and he insisted that i go  take a shower when i asked him why he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1816480,1822080,said he prefers for everything to be  clean obviously i got offended and said  i am clean he then rolled his eyes and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1822080,1827120,said okay never mind and then we did it  part two is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,1829120,1834399,is it okay that my boyfriend insists  that i wash myself before any sexy time  when he told me he wanted me to be clean
tgx9QrRz6g8,1834399,1839919,i said i am clean so we proceeded to do  it everything was pretty normal after  that he was really affectionate and kept
tgx9QrRz6g8,1839919,1845279,complimenting me a few days later it was  going to be our second time but before  anything starts to happen he once again
tgx9QrRz6g8,1845279,1852159,asked me to go take a shower i asked him  if i smelt bad or something and he said  no i just think that you should take a  shower i decided to keep my cool and i
tgx9QrRz6g8,1852159,1857919,went and took a shower but the routine  stuck every single time we were gonna do  anything he would ask me to go take a
tgx9QrRz6g8,1857919,1864000,shower now i wonder what you might be  thinking no i do not smell bad i usually  take two showers a day anyway one in the
tgx9QrRz6g8,1864000,1870880,morning after working out and then one  at night before getting into bed so i  know i don't smell bad but now it's a  total inconvenience every time we want
tgx9QrRz6g8,1870880,1877679,to do it he asked me to go take a shower  even if i'm dressed even if i have  makeup on so i started avoiding it at  all cost anytime he would ask me to do
tgx9QrRz6g8,1877679,1882720,it i would just say no because of this  we actually broke up for two months when  we got back together it was the same
tgx9QrRz6g8,1882720,1888240,exact thing once again i was taking a  shower every single time part three is  up
tgx9QrRz6g8,1890159,1895919,is it okay that my boyfriend insists on  me washing myself before any sexy time i  actually even began associating sexy
tgx9QrRz6g8,1895919,1902399,time with being dirty because he would  insist so much i would actually start to  feel shame knew that i was clean and i  washed myself multiple times a day even
tgx9QrRz6g8,1902399,1908159,when i knew i wasn't gonna see him i  decided to reach out to an ex-girlfriend  of his on instagram and i asked her if  she had the same problem with him and
tgx9QrRz6g8,1908159,1914480,she proceeded to send me paragraphs and  paragraphs of all the things that he  made her do not only would he make her  shower before sexy time but he would
tgx9QrRz6g8,1914480,1920559,make her brush her teeth before kissing  and fully removing her makeup too i told  her that my theory was that he must have  had a bad experience with some other
tgx9QrRz6g8,1920559,1926720,girl then she told me her theory that he  likes being in control and that the only  reason he asked us to do all these  things was so that he could feel in
tgx9QrRz6g8,1926720,1931840,control by the way her and i are now  friends so here's what i did the next  time i saw my boyfriend i asked him to
tgx9QrRz6g8,1931840,1938559,take a shower and guess what he got  totally offended i pulled him up on the  fact that he makes me shower every  single time and he said that i should be
tgx9QrRz6g8,1938559,1943600,happy to do whatever it takes to make  him happy now i refuse to take a shower  whenever he wants me to and because of
tgx9QrRz6g8,1943600,1950080,that he's always in a bad mood he even  told my best friend that i wasn't a  considerate girlfriend how dare he  complain to her now here's the thing i'm
tgx9QrRz6g8,1950080,1955519,very attracted to him and i feel like  i'm falling in love with him but this is  the only thing that's holding me back he  even mentioned moving in together what
tgx9QrRz6g8,1955519,1961600,should i do  story time about how i've been in love
tgx9QrRz6g8,1961600,1967279,with my best friend for six years this  is not my story time with sending me an  instagram let's call my best friend rick
tgx9QrRz6g8,1967279,1973279,rick and i have known each other since  we were three years old we're actually  neighbors and we went to the same school  grew up at the same time and we did
tgx9QrRz6g8,1973279,1979679,everything together as kids most people  thought we were siblings his mom became  my mom's best friend and our parents  would go to dinner almost every single
tgx9QrRz6g8,1979679,1985760,week growing up we treated each other  like siblings he always watched out for  me and had my back when we were in  school but things started to change when
tgx9QrRz6g8,1985760,1990799,we got into high school rick started  dating a lot of the girls in school  suddenly i started to get really jealous
tgx9QrRz6g8,1990799,1996480,instead of spending time with me he  would start spending time with his new  girlfriend's duh but we would always go  to school together and instead he
tgx9QrRz6g8,1996480,2002720,started dropping off and picking up his  own girlfriend so i didn't have a ride  to school anymore instead my dad would  take me to school we would always hang
tgx9QrRz6g8,2002720,2009039,out after class and on the weekends so  you can understand this was a huge  change for me at first i thought i was  just jealous because i was losing my
tgx9QrRz6g8,2009039,2014799,best friend but when i told my mom she  asked me if i was in love with him at  first i was like no freaking way but
tgx9QrRz6g8,2014799,2021519,then i became even more jealous i was  always angry with him for hanging out  with his girlfriends i started missing  him so much and i couldn't stop thinking
tgx9QrRz6g8,2021519,2027919,about him i was constantly checking if  he was home or not i would simply look  out the window and see that his car  wasn't there i played it off as much as
tgx9QrRz6g8,2027919,2032960,i could when i would see him we all  happened to go to a party and his  girlfriend was there with him i don't  know where she taps me on the shoulder
tgx9QrRz6g8,2032960,2038000,and asks me if i'm in love with rick i  didn't know what to say part two is uh
tgx9QrRz6g8,2039919,2046159,part two of how i've been in love with  my best friend for six years this is not  my story time is sending me an instagram  at the party his girlfriend asked me if
tgx9QrRz6g8,2046159,2051679,i'm in love with him i actually froze  and didn't say anything then she got  right up in my face and asked me again i
tgx9QrRz6g8,2051679,2056878,answered no and basically ran away from  the party when i got home i got a text  from rick asking me if i was okay i told
tgx9QrRz6g8,2056878,2062638,him i was just tired and i wasn't having  fun at the party then he sends me a  screenshot of messages his girlfriend  sent him in the messages she told him
tgx9QrRz6g8,2062638,2068240,that she thought i was in love with him  and that she could tell just by the way  that i looked at him he told her there  was no way and that i was just a sister
tgx9QrRz6g8,2068240,2074720,to him he actually thought it was  hilarious that she would think that god  if only he knew that it was true he then  told me that he needed to stay away from
tgx9QrRz6g8,2074720,2080638,me just to not make her jealous this  hurt me so much he was choosing her over  me she actually ended up cheating on him
tgx9QrRz6g8,2080638,2087118,and they broke up a few years passed by  and during that time i dated other  people but i couldn't stop thinking  about rick guess what i did i moved two
tgx9QrRz6g8,2087118,2091679,cities away just to avoid him part three  is up
tgx9QrRz6g8,2094000,2099280,part three if i've been in love with my  best friend for six years after i moved  away just to try to forget him it did
tgx9QrRz6g8,2099280,2104480,not work i just couldn't stop thinking  about him after a year i moved back to  my hometown i decided i would be honest
tgx9QrRz6g8,2104480,2111119,with rick and tell him how i really feel  about him well it's been a year since i  moved home and i still haven't told him  anything girls fall over themselves just
tgx9QrRz6g8,2111119,2118079,to try to date him and everyone he's  ever dated literally looks like a model  and i know that i can't compete with  that now i know i'm not ugly or anything
tgx9QrRz6g8,2118079,2124640,but i'm definitely not the model type i  decided to open up to rick's mom and i  told her how i felt she's actually  really happy that i told her the truth
tgx9QrRz6g8,2124640,2130320,and she told me that she always  suspected it she also told me she would  love rick and i to date i told her that  i just didn't have the courage to tell
tgx9QrRz6g8,2130320,2136240,him how i really felt i mean imagine you  going up to your crush and telling them  that you like them it's so hard she also
tgx9QrRz6g8,2136240,2141680,told me rick wants to get married soon  and finally settle down apparently he's  sick of dating around so basically he's
tgx9QrRz6g8,2141680,2148000,looking for a wife i don't want to sit  on the sidelines and watch him with  somebody else the rest of my life i just  can't muster up the courage to tell him
tgx9QrRz6g8,2148000,2153920,rick and i had dinner a few nights ago  and he told me that he actually liked  someone from his job i almost started  crying right then and there in front of
tgx9QrRz6g8,2153920,2160640,him i'm hoping he doesn't ask her out i  want to find a way to tell him without  me dying of embarrassment if you have  any ideas please let me know or maybe i
tgx9QrRz6g8,2160640,2166079,just shouldn't tell him at all maybe i  can find someone else what do you think  am i the for getting mad about

tgx9QrRz6g8,2424800,2430960,absolutely crazy and they didn't want me  to move in with him but i did anyway i  come from a latino family so this was  absolutely reprehensible i went against
tgx9QrRz6g8,2430960,2436640,my family's wishes and they actually  stopped speaking to me for a little bit  but luckily i got them back my boyfriend  during that time gave me all his support
tgx9QrRz6g8,2436640,2442000,he told me that my family would come  around eventually and that they would  see that we were in love so living  together was a logical next step after
tgx9QrRz6g8,2442000,2447440,three months of living together i knew  that i wanted to marry him and he would  talk about marriage all the time he  asked me what kind of ring i would want
