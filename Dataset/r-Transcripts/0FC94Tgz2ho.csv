0FC94Tgz2ho,16320,18160,hey what's up guys mkbhd here welcome
0FC94Tgz2ho,18160,20320,back to dope tech the series where we
0FC94Tgz2ho,20320,22720,take a look at the most impressive most
0FC94Tgz2ho,22720,23680,amazing
0FC94Tgz2ho,23680,25760,most incredible tech that's out there
0FC94Tgz2ho,25760,27519,brought to you by the dope tech shirt of
0FC94Tgz2ho,27519,29439,course and so in this quarantine edition
0FC94Tgz2ho,29439,31199,of dope tech we've got some tech that's
0FC94Tgz2ho,31199,33440,around the studio right now
0FC94Tgz2ho,33440,35440,that is still really crazy impressive
0FC94Tgz2ho,35440,37200,sometimes we do like a montage version
0FC94Tgz2ho,37200,38800,sometimes the whole episode is about one
0FC94Tgz2ho,38800,40320,thing there's some stuff around the
0FC94Tgz2ho,40320,42079,studio to show let's get into it okay
0FC94Tgz2ho,42079,44960,item number one is this
0FC94Tgz2ho,44960,45920,table
0FC94Tgz2ho,45920,47840,that i've been talking about on twitter
0FC94Tgz2ho,47840,49840,and instagram and showing so this is
0FC94Tgz2ho,49840,53199,called the sisyphus table sisyphus table
0FC94Tgz2ho,53199,54879,there's a bunch of different styles and
0FC94Tgz2ho,54879,56960,and types and versions of this but what
0FC94Tgz2ho,56960,58719,you should know is sisyphus is the
0FC94Tgz2ho,58719,60160,figure from greek mythology who is
0FC94Tgz2ho,60160,63039,condemned to rolling a huge boulder up a
0FC94Tgz2ho,63039,66159,mountain for eternity on this table that
0FC94Tgz2ho,66159,68880,boulder is this steel marble rolling
0FC94Tgz2ho,68880,71439,through the sand and sisyphus is a
0FC94Tgz2ho,71439,73840,rotating magnet positioned by a wi-fi
0FC94Tgz2ho,73840,75439,connected robot arm i've been super into
0FC94Tgz2ho,75439,77200,this table for no other reason than just
0FC94Tgz2ho,77200,79200,how cool it looks when it's doing its
0FC94Tgz2ho,79200,81600,thing and how i guess easily distracted
0FC94Tgz2ho,81600,83200,i can be
0FC94Tgz2ho,83200,84840,by a little marble rolling
0FC94Tgz2ho,84840,87040,around but it's really cool
0FC94Tgz2ho,87040,88960,fundamentally it's just a regular table
0FC94Tgz2ho,88960,91360,on top with this thin layer of silica
0FC94Tgz2ho,91360,93119,sand that comes with the table itself
0FC94Tgz2ho,93119,94720,you literally just pour it in and spread
0FC94Tgz2ho,94720,97759,it out and set it up then underneath is
0FC94Tgz2ho,97759,99920,the tech itself which is a computer
0FC94Tgz2ho,99920,102079,that's rotating this arm around with a
0FC94Tgz2ho,102079,104479,magnet on it that controls where that
0FC94Tgz2ho,104479,106560,ball goes and it's a pretty fine-tuned
0FC94Tgz2ho,106560,108159,control as you can see to the point
0FC94Tgz2ho,108159,110240,where you know these overlapping lines
0FC94Tgz2ho,110240,112640,can create these thin lines and really
0FC94Tgz2ho,112640,115680,precise shapes and designs you can add
0FC94Tgz2ho,115680,117840,more or less sand too for a different
0FC94Tgz2ho,117840,118640,look
0FC94Tgz2ho,118640,120960,and there's an led ring around the table
0FC94Tgz2ho,120960,123759,that makes this dramatic evenly lit look
0FC94Tgz2ho,123759,125439,that i'm super into then on top of all
0FC94Tgz2ho,125439,127759,that there's an app there's a sisyphus
0FC94Tgz2ho,127759,129840,app that lets you control everything so
0FC94Tgz2ho,129840,131599,there are whole playlists of user
0FC94Tgz2ho,131599,133840,generated patterns and images that you
0FC94Tgz2ho,133840,136080,can have it draw some are simple
0FC94Tgz2ho,136080,138800,and some are much more complex and you
0FC94Tgz2ho,138800,140720,can even attempt to make your own in the
0FC94Tgz2ho,140720,142879,app itself but it is super hard let me
0FC94Tgz2ho,142879,144720,tell you to make anything that looks as
0FC94Tgz2ho,144720,146000,good as the stuff that's already there
0FC94Tgz2ho,146000,147920,so i stick with the pre-made ones it
0FC94Tgz2ho,147920,150480,also does this really satisfying erasing
0FC94Tgz2ho,150480,152959,sequence after every new piece of art i
0FC94Tgz2ho,152959,155040,could watch it all day literally which
0FC94Tgz2ho,155040,156959,is i guess why i put it in a different
0FC94Tgz2ho,156959,158400,room but really that's what made it dope
0FC94Tgz2ho,158400,160000,tech for me it's it's technically
0FC94Tgz2ho,160000,162959,internet connected it has an app it is
0FC94Tgz2ho,162959,165440,tech but really it's moving art it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,165440,167440,it's mesmerizing watching the ball go
0FC94Tgz2ho,167440,170319,around in circles and draw these new
0FC94Tgz2ho,170319,173120,designs erase everything then draw
0FC94Tgz2ho,173120,175360,something new erase it again and just
0FC94Tgz2ho,175360,177680,continue perpetually
0FC94Tgz2ho,177680,178720,forever
0FC94Tgz2ho,178720,180640,just like the myth itself alright next
0FC94Tgz2ho,180640,184000,item up is this guy right here this is
0FC94Tgz2ho,184000,185440,the matte black
0FC94Tgz2ho,185440,188640,phantom reactor it's a wireless speaker
0FC94Tgz2ho,188640,190239,it's pretty compact you can see it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,190239,191680,plugged into the wall
0FC94Tgz2ho,191680,193599,and it's most impressive for how small
0FC94Tgz2ho,193599,194720,it is
0FC94Tgz2ho,194720,196000,versus
0FC94Tgz2ho,196000,198480,how incredibly loud it actually gets so
0FC94Tgz2ho,198480,200159,this version of the phantom is it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,200159,202480,maybe the size of an ipad mini it's like
0FC94Tgz2ho,202480,205120,eight inches long six inches wide
0FC94Tgz2ho,205120,208720,and it weighs 4.3 kilograms or about 10
0FC94Tgz2ho,208720,210720,pounds so it's like a bowling ball so
0FC94Tgz2ho,210720,212400,it's a super compact design
0FC94Tgz2ho,212400,214000,and it's also pretty simple so besides
0FC94Tgz2ho,214000,216000,being matte black it's nice and clean
0FC94Tgz2ho,216000,218080,it's the smaller full range driver on
0FC94Tgz2ho,218080,221440,the front and then these two side pieces
0FC94Tgz2ho,221440,224239,are the woofers that really move air and
0FC94Tgz2ho,224239,225680,then on the back you have these fins
0FC94Tgz2ho,225680,227680,that are literally a heat sink and the
0FC94Tgz2ho,227680,230080,whole idea is the cabinet is so compact
0FC94Tgz2ho,230080,232720,and so dense that it produces this super
0FC94Tgz2ho,232720,235200,loud sound from how much air it moves
0FC94Tgz2ho,235200,237280,and it moves a lot of air when it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,237280,238959,playing you know at high volumes get
0FC94Tgz2ho,238959,240480,this massive
0FC94Tgz2ho,240480,242799,punchy rich bass from these big drivers
0FC94Tgz2ho,242799,244400,and how much air they they push from all
0FC94Tgz2ho,244400,245760,that small cabinet space it's already
0FC94Tgz2ho,245760,247360,connected to spotify let me play a
0FC94Tgz2ho,247360,251840,little quick demo from jordan edmonds
0FC94Tgz2ho,252400,255840,it's half volume
0FC94Tgz2ho,256100,266569,[Music]
0FC94Tgz2ho,268240,270080,so i got two of them but when you get
0FC94Tgz2ho,270080,271919,two of the exact same model you can pair
0FC94Tgz2ho,271919,273440,them together as a stereo pair so
0FC94Tgz2ho,273440,274960,there's one over here one on the other
0FC94Tgz2ho,274960,276400,side of the studio and they're a
0FC94Tgz2ho,276400,278080,left-right stereo pair and then when you
0FC94Tgz2ho,278080,280000,connect to it in spotify it sees it as
0FC94Tgz2ho,280000,282720,one speaker and appropriately splits it
0FC94Tgz2ho,282720,285680,and then you get that sweet loud stereo
0FC94Tgz2ho,285680,287040,image it actually does have a little bit
0FC94Tgz2ho,287040,288720,of computer on the inside for the record
0FC94Tgz2ho,288720,290400,every speaker does but this one of
0FC94Tgz2ho,290400,292160,course has internet connected features
0FC94Tgz2ho,292160,294800,too so it has an arm processor and half
0FC94Tgz2ho,294800,297120,a gig of ram and you know your wi-fi
0FC94Tgz2ho,297120,298639,chip that's all it needs
0FC94Tgz2ho,298639,301360,and yeah this speaker is a it's a tiny
0FC94Tgz2ho,301360,304000,portable noise complaint is what it is
0FC94Tgz2ho,304000,307840,it gets so crazy loud at high volume uh
0FC94Tgz2ho,307840,309919,and has surprisingly little distortion
0FC94Tgz2ho,309919,311840,at those high volumes not surprisingly
0FC94Tgz2ho,311840,314160,it is a pretty bass heavy sound overall
0FC94Tgz2ho,314160,316160,there isn't really a midsize driver to
0FC94Tgz2ho,316160,318080,focus on the mids so it can kind of feel
0FC94Tgz2ho,318080,320560,like a v-shaped eq but honestly for what
0FC94Tgz2ho,320560,322720,i'm using it for filling up a room
0FC94Tgz2ho,322720,325360,somewhere or just outdoor space it's not
0FC94Tgz2ho,325360,326720,a huge deal and i know in the title it
0FC94Tgz2ho,326720,328880,says it's a 3 500 speaker there's
0FC94Tgz2ho,328880,330080,actually a couple different versions of
0FC94Tgz2ho,330080,333600,it there's a 600 and a 900 watt version
0FC94Tgz2ho,333600,336080,this is the the 900 watt compact version
0FC94Tgz2ho,336080,337680,but then there's a bigger
0FC94Tgz2ho,337680,338800,phantom
0FC94Tgz2ho,338800,341120,that's 2 000 watts
0FC94Tgz2ho,341120,344800,and then 4 500 watts so you're over 100
0FC94Tgz2ho,344800,347120,decibels peak at that point which is
0FC94Tgz2ho,347120,349280,nuts but that high-end version costs
0FC94Tgz2ho,349280,351440,about four thousand dollars so you know
0FC94Tgz2ho,351440,353360,this is uh a little safer than that i
0FC94Tgz2ho,353360,355600,guess all i'm really saying is
0FC94Tgz2ho,355600,357280,it's worth the noise complaint it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,357280,358800,really impressive okay this next one in
0FC94Tgz2ho,358800,360960,dope tech is for my fellow video nerds
0FC94Tgz2ho,360960,363280,out there you'll know who you are if i
0FC94Tgz2ho,363280,366880,say helios 44-2
0FC94Tgz2ho,366880,368800,and your ears perk up a little bit
0FC94Tgz2ho,368800,369919,that's where we're going with this one
0FC94Tgz2ho,369919,372000,so in order to understand why
0FC94Tgz2ho,372000,372800,this
0FC94Tgz2ho,372800,374960,is dope tech you have to understand
0FC94Tgz2ho,374960,376720,what's so special about
0FC94Tgz2ho,376720,379680,the original helios 44-2 so this is my
0FC94Tgz2ho,379680,383199,helios 44-2 lens it obviously doesn't
0FC94Tgz2ho,383199,385360,look quite like the rest of the lenses
0FC94Tgz2ho,385360,387120,in the collection and that's because
0FC94Tgz2ho,387120,390319,it's a vintage used russian lens you can
0FC94Tgz2ho,390319,392800,grab on amazon or ebay for about 60
0FC94Tgz2ho,392800,394960,bucks i've had it for a while and it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,394960,398160,known for its swirly bokeh and really
0FC94Tgz2ho,398160,400319,fun optical characteristics see most
0FC94Tgz2ho,400319,402080,modern lenses especially in the cinema
0FC94Tgz2ho,402080,406080,world are very clinical rectilinear
0FC94Tgz2ho,406080,408400,super high on maximizing sharpness
0FC94Tgz2ho,408400,410400,minimizing distortion and giving you the
0FC94Tgz2ho,410400,412319,most accurate look possible
0FC94Tgz2ho,412319,414080,and generally that's good but sometimes
0FC94Tgz2ho,414080,416080,you just want a more fun look to play
0FC94Tgz2ho,416080,417680,with so you might have recognized this
0FC94Tgz2ho,417680,420560,swirly background in various mkbhd
0FC94Tgz2ho,420560,422080,videos in the past and these have all
0FC94Tgz2ho,422080,424720,come from this one little vintage helios
0FC94Tgz2ho,424720,427039,lens it is a 58 millimeter lens and it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,427039,429599,not particularly sharp and it's also so
0FC94Tgz2ho,429599,432240,old that it's really not very well built
0FC94Tgz2ho,432240,435039,or easy to use but it gets the job done
0FC94Tgz2ho,435039,436880,and the look is fun so this as you might
0FC94Tgz2ho,436880,439520,have guessed is what's called a rehoused
0FC94Tgz2ho,439520,442000,lens a rehouse version of this and it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,442000,443360,it's pretty common in the industry to
0FC94Tgz2ho,443360,445440,re-house various lenses for certain
0FC94Tgz2ho,445440,446479,reasons
0FC94Tgz2ho,446479,448560,uh but for this one it makes perfect
0FC94Tgz2ho,448560,451039,sense so it's still as optically fun and
0FC94Tgz2ho,451039,452800,unique as the helios because it's the
0FC94Tgz2ho,452800,455120,same glass but it's in a barrel that
0FC94Tgz2ho,455120,457039,gives it much better build quality a
0FC94Tgz2ho,457039,458960,much longer life
0FC94Tgz2ho,458960,460800,and then a much longer focus throw to
0FC94Tgz2ho,460800,462639,make it easier to focus on things it
0FC94Tgz2ho,462639,464560,gives it gears for a follow focus if you
0FC94Tgz2ho,464560,466960,want to use that it gives it threads for
0FC94Tgz2ho,466960,468879,filters if you want to add those and
0FC94Tgz2ho,468879,471520,just overall a more satisfying confident
0FC94Tgz2ho,471520,473599,feel this one's made by a company called
0FC94Tgz2ho,473599,476240,iron glass it's linked below and it's
0FC94Tgz2ho,476240,477919,awesome so to those wondering where the
0FC94Tgz2ho,477919,480400,swirly background shots come from now
0FC94Tgz2ho,480400,483680,you know fun fact did you know that
0FC94Tgz2ho,483680,485840,one terabyte sd cards
0FC94Tgz2ho,485840,487360,are just out there in the world now
0FC94Tgz2ho,487360,489440,along with one terabyte micro sd cards
0FC94Tgz2ho,489440,490400,as well
0FC94Tgz2ho,490400,491440,this
0FC94Tgz2ho,491440,493840,is 350 bucks so it is pretty expensive
0FC94Tgz2ho,493840,497039,for an sd card but it's also not insane
0FC94Tgz2ho,497039,499360,for a terabyte and the grand scheme of
0FC94Tgz2ho,499360,501039,terabytes you can buy
0FC94Tgz2ho,501039,502879,anyway i'd feel a little nervous putting
0FC94Tgz2ho,502879,504319,that much data on a card you could just
0FC94Tgz2ho,504319,506800,snap in half but i'll link this below
0FC94Tgz2ho,506800,507919,along with all the rest of the stuff
0FC94Tgz2ho,507919,510240,from this episode in case you're uh
0FC94Tgz2ho,510240,511599,feeling dangerous but anyway there you
0FC94Tgz2ho,511599,514240,have it an insane bluetooth speaker a
0FC94Tgz2ho,514240,516000,magnetic table
0FC94Tgz2ho,516000,518159,vintage rehouse lenses another episode
0FC94Tgz2ho,518159,520000,of dope tech in the books thank you for
0FC94Tgz2ho,520000,520959,watching
0FC94Tgz2ho,520959,523440,and i'll catch you guys in the next one
0FC94Tgz2ho,523440,526440,peace
