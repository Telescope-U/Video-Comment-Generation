HJLNtge8jv4,70960,76640,some of this yeah and this recipe you  can make at home with a grownup yeah and
HJLNtge8jv4,76640,83920,then after you make it you can squish it  nice and flat and then  you take some of these and eat
HJLNtge8jv4,83920,89040,and then you cut it out whoa  and maybe we can spell some words
HJLNtge8jv4,89040,94720,together  maybe we can  make an airplane together whoa this is
HJLNtge8jv4,94720,102079,gonna be so much fun okay so the first  thing we have to do  is have all the ingredients for this

HJLNtge8jv4,1413919,1419919,we're going to want to make sure that we  get a true tablespoon because that is  not accurate so we want to scrape off

HJLNtge8jv4,1454400,1461440,you want to crack hard  and use your thumbs  to break open the egg just like that

HJLNtge8jv4,1513840,1520399,like that  now we're ready
HJLNtge8jv4,1520480,1526360,okay all right next we're going to want  to do a cup of panko

HJLNtge8jv4,1648720,1656110,perfect  thank you  all right put some water in with the egg
HJLNtge8jv4,1656110,1662640,[Music]  perfect  can you  whisk that egg up with the fork for me
HJLNtge8jv4,1662640,1669919,with the fork  forks are easier to whisk eggs than a  whisk is oh you want to whisk it
HJLNtge8jv4,1669919,1676480,just like that okay so let's take the  fork and  let's whisk the egg
HJLNtge8jv4,1676480,1683840,whoa  did you see how the yolk broke up  and now it's all mixed up
HJLNtge8jv4,1684240,1689679,perfect  perfect  we're gonna grab a couple handfuls of
HJLNtge8jv4,1689679,1695120,green beans right in here  right
HJLNtge8jv4,1695120,1703200,perfect and toss it in our flour all  right make sure you get them all nice  and mixed up and coated in flour okay
HJLNtge8jv4,1703200,1710399,toss it  [Music]  wow this is gonna help the egg stick to
HJLNtge8jv4,1710399,1717840,the green bean okay  interesting  look  they used to be green but now
HJLNtge8jv4,1717840,1724159,they're green and white  hey remember how we washed our hands  yeah good thing we did because i'm
HJLNtge8jv4,1724159,1731600,touching food with my hands you don't  want to touch anything after you touch  egg or raw meat you want to make sure
HJLNtge8jv4,1731600,1738559,you wash your hands okay  all right now we are going to touch the  egg we're gonna put
HJLNtge8jv4,1738559,1744320,the green beans we're gonna use two  different hands we're gonna have our dry  hand and our wet hand
HJLNtge8jv4,1744320,1752320,so we're not gonna touch the egg with  this hand  we're gonna put our green beans in here  and toss it around
HJLNtge8jv4,1752320,1758480,okay  take the fork out  now

HJLNtge8jv4,1815279,1821919,spread out on there there you go that  makes sense oh i see because if they're  on top of each other then the heat can't
HJLNtge8jv4,1821919,1827039,touch the whole green bean huh exactly  you want to make sure that the
HJLNtge8jv4,1827039,1832240,whole thing is getting cooked  we're ready for the oven okay

HJLNtge8jv4,2243359,2250079,velocity race  yeah  that's where we put a lot of these items
HJLNtge8jv4,2250079,2255920,on this ramp yeah see how this ramp is  at an angle yeah we're gonna let them go
HJLNtge8jv4,2255920,2263280,at the same time and see what item  reaches the bottom first  okay so let's go with
HJLNtge8jv4,2263280,2269920,heat number one the slow pokes  we have this sweet colorful beach ball
HJLNtge8jv4,2269920,2275920,and then we have  this really light balloon okay all right
HJLNtge8jv4,2275920,2282079,what one do you think is gonna reach the  bottom first  i think i know
HJLNtge8jv4,2282079,2289359,three two one  whoa  did you see that yeah the beach ball
HJLNtge8jv4,2289359,2295200,went to the bottom first okay let's let  them just you know get warmed up for
HJLNtge8jv4,2295200,2301839,later and then we'll use some more items  yeah i'm sure all these items are gonna
HJLNtge8jv4,2301839,2306960,be a lot faster  okay here's another set of items
HJLNtge8jv4,2306960,2313040,they're actually the same item  water bottles yeah but this one is empty
HJLNtge8jv4,2313040,2319920,and this one is half full  [Music]  all right  let's put them on their side
HJLNtge8jv4,2319920,2326880,and then let's let them roll down  okay are you ready yeah i'm ready are
HJLNtge8jv4,2326880,2333200,you ready i'm ready awesome three two  one
HJLNtge8jv4,2333280,2340400,whoa  yeah  wow  the half full water bottle
HJLNtge8jv4,2340400,2345839,totally beat the empty water bottle how  do you feel after your race half full
HJLNtge8jv4,2345839,2352400,water bottle oh blippi i feel amazing i  can't believe i've won great well
HJLNtge8jv4,2352400,2358400,it's gonna move on to the next race  half full water bottle versus
HJLNtge8jv4,2358400,2363920,extremely bright orange duct tape  all right
HJLNtge8jv4,2363920,2371520,here we go  are you ready ready to race are you  ready you know i'm ready all right three
HJLNtge8jv4,2371520,2378400,two one  whoa  did you see that yeah the water bottle
HJLNtge8jv4,2378400,2385200,rolled down way to the bottom way quick  way faster than the duct tape
HJLNtge8jv4,2385200,2390880,perfect so now it can move on to the  next round have you ever wondered why
HJLNtge8jv4,2390880,2396800,these items some go fast and some go  slow  yeah
HJLNtge8jv4,2396800,2403280,it's because their velocity yeah  velocity is basically the speed at which
HJLNtge8jv4,2403280,2408400,they're rolling down the speed and the  direction yeah there's a lot of things
HJLNtge8jv4,2408400,2413680,that actually determine what the item's  velocity is i mean
HJLNtge8jv4,2413680,2421359,like  think about it like this there could be  a lot of friction and  like can't slide or maybe it rolls
HJLNtge8jv4,2421359,2427359,compared to you know maybe they're sharp  edges  there's just so many things that
HJLNtge8jv4,2427359,2436000,you know  determine how fast  how  much velocity these items have so let's
HJLNtge8jv4,2436000,2444480,let these two items go we have orange  over here and apple over here and let's
HJLNtge8jv4,2444480,2450160,see  whoa
HJLNtge8jv4,2450160,2459160,they were actually really close to each  other i don't even know who won let's  see that instant replay
HJLNtge8jv4,2464220,2472800,[Music]  whoa  that was awesome all right let's pick
HJLNtge8jv4,2472800,2480400,two  more  items  we have  a soccer ball or a football depends
HJLNtge8jv4,2480400,2485680,where you live and the  huffle
HJLNtge8jv4,2485680,2492480,water bottle  the champion  okay let's see who wins all right
HJLNtge8jv4,2492480,2497599,here we go  are you ready i'm good to go
HJLNtge8jv4,2497599,2503359,are you ready always fold already all  right  and away
HJLNtge8jv4,2503359,2510800,we  go  whoa  i cannot believe it the half full water
HJLNtge8jv4,2510800,2518960,bottle wins the velocity race  and the crowd goes wild
HJLNtge8jv4,2519040,2524160,wow that was awesome learning about  velocity and how fast that water bottle
HJLNtge8jv4,2524160,2529680,went and how the ramp is angled but yeah  if the ramp was flat it definitely
HJLNtge8jv4,2529680,2535839,wouldn't go anywhere right yeah hey can  you think of a machine that is actually
HJLNtge8jv4,2535839,2541440,really fast  yeah there's a lot of them okay let me  give you a hint
HJLNtge8jv4,2541440,2547040,okay this machine  does not go on the ground well it does
HJLNtge8jv4,2547040,2551839,but then it goes in the air  yeah
HJLNtge8jv4,2552480,2557520,i hear one  yeah maybe you've got to fly in one  before
HJLNtge8jv4,2557520,2566160,fly yeah they fly in the air  yeah  airplanes yeah airplanes are really fast
HJLNtge8jv4,2566160,2574519,and speaking of speed and velocity i  think you and i should watch the  airplane video
HJLNtge8jv4,2575730,2580719,[Music]
HJLNtge8jv4,2591480,2598880,airplanes airplanes  flying all around the sky

HJLNtge8jv4,2662079,2669680,some airplanes fly just for fun some fly  for business trips business or pleasure
HJLNtge8jv4,2669680,2677119,you can make an airplane out of paper  throw it in the air and watch it go
HJLNtge8jv4,2677119,2684880,i love to look up and see its wings  waving down at me

HJLNtge8jv4,3176240,3182400,water becomes these little tiny  particles and goes up in the air yeah it
HJLNtge8jv4,3182400,3190400,turns into a gas  goes up in the air and then turns into  some clouds
