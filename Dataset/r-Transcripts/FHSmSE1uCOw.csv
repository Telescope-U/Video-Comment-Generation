FHSmSE1uCOw,108890,114159,[Laughter]  but we thought okay the crusaders were
FHSmSE1uCOw,114159,121040,going to come out and play this you know  eight-man or five-man sort of game but  they didn't you know they mixed it up  they challenged the outsides the kicking
FHSmSE1uCOw,121040,128720,games the kicking him that they played  quite phenomenal goldie yeah look the  first thing for me was 43 000 people 43
FHSmSE1uCOw,128720,135520,000 people i think for me kirsty that  was what we were looking for we wanted  the stage to be set we've got the game  we wanted in terms of the match up i
FHSmSE1uCOw,135520,141280,just don't know if we got the contest we  were looking for but that comes down to  the class of the crusaders we've got a
FHSmSE1uCOw,141280,147680,lot more to talk about on the show we do  a lot more to talk about the  celebrations have well and truly kicked  off christchurch airport this morning
FHSmSE1uCOw,147680,154000,and now the team is celebrating and they  deserve so as well let's talk super  rugby with nerfin available at chemist
FHSmSE1uCOw,154000,162040,warehouse  is the moment of truth
FHSmSE1uCOw,170640,177560,the first  super rugby pacific title  goes to the crusaders and emphatic
FHSmSE1uCOw,177560,185168,21-7 win over the blues  [Applause]
FHSmSE1uCOw,186560,191760,you have to hand it to them jeff six  titles in a row they are like our  chicago bulls with michael jordan and
FHSmSE1uCOw,191760,197200,david harvey said after the game to you  mills this is what dreams are made of  they are a great team world-class
FHSmSE1uCOw,197200,203280,performance in their most difficult  stage they weren't at home they rose to  the challenge they did everything they
FHSmSE1uCOw,203280,209599,needed to do  clearly well prepared clearly well  coached mills they went out and  delivered and they're big players and
FHSmSE1uCOw,209599,216400,they had plenty of them i don't think  there wasn't a player who didn't deliver  on the night and that tells you how good
FHSmSE1uCOw,216400,223280,this side and how good this environment  is oh it's a nonstop right from the  get-go and it's interesting talking to  scott barrett and he was quite nervous
FHSmSE1uCOw,223280,228640,you know like you mentioned the fact  they had to come to auckland away from  home this is new territory in terms of a
FHSmSE1uCOw,228640,233920,final but everyone was on the same page  and they had real self-belief um you
FHSmSE1uCOw,233920,239599,know that you know that what they were  going into you know they were going to  come away with the goods i mean there  was a period when the blues really
FHSmSE1uCOw,239599,244720,defended you thought man if they could  hold on hold on you know it could  possibly you know the momentum could you
FHSmSE1uCOw,244720,251200,know swap the other way but  jk they were just just on a different  level i think the disappointing thing
FHSmSE1uCOw,251200,256959,from a blues perspective was actually  sam we spoke about it all week didn't we
FHSmSE1uCOw,256959,262880,we spoke about sam whitelock having  something up his sleeve especially from  the line out point of view and it
FHSmSE1uCOw,262880,269360,started there and the blues didn't  really deal with it and then we saw some  of the old habits coming in like pushing
FHSmSE1uCOw,269360,275280,that past goldie you know without trying  to make create something instead of  being patient i can't i can't remember
FHSmSE1uCOw,275280,281040,them having the ball with any sequence  of play where they didn't make a mistake  until the second half
FHSmSE1uCOw,281040,287600,and that's just pressure that's just  you're waiting for a final you get there  and then it's not what you expect and
FHSmSE1uCOw,287600,293199,you've got this juggernaut in front of  you so i thought there was some really  interesting performances thought
FHSmSE1uCOw,293199,299759,whitelock was outstanding i thought  scott i thought scott barrett after his  red card was a little bit tentative but
FHSmSE1uCOw,299759,304880,last night he got back to just that that  really devastating really tough play at
FHSmSE1uCOw,304880,310160,the ruck so  for me it was a real game that you talk
FHSmSE1uCOw,310160,315440,about  setting it up up front you know we  talked about it uh last night and we'll
FHSmSE1uCOw,315440,320880,talk about it  for many weeks to come in regards to  their performance being based on the  back of one thing
FHSmSE1uCOw,320880,326800,and their line out defense  was the one factor that the blues didn't  counter and it meant that they were in
FHSmSE1uCOw,326800,333759,control of the ball in control of  territory and where they played the game  we'll look at the stats a little bit  later on but bottom line the blues were
FHSmSE1uCOw,333759,340479,never in a field position and were never  in control of position to get their game  going and this is the thing that
FHSmSE1uCOw,340479,346000,probably was disappointing if i'm  thinking from a blues perspective is the  fact what are the crusaders done in all
FHSmSE1uCOw,346000,351520,of their title reigns they focus at the  source and the source of the game is the
FHSmSE1uCOw,351520,356720,set piece  whether it be the line out or the scrum  pure and simple mills that's the
FHSmSE1uCOw,356720,361759,fundament fundamentals of the game  that's where you have to start and  prepare for and when they put pressure
FHSmSE1uCOw,361759,367360,on here at source it just takes you  right out of their game this is where  they were remarkable and you talk about
FHSmSE1uCOw,367360,373520,being on the same page they're on the  same page as the blues line out and this  is where this game for me was won and
FHSmSE1uCOw,373520,379840,lost because the blues were never in at  the moment they couldn't control  position why did they not see that  coming though well when the rest was
FHSmSE1uCOw,379840,385440,going to say when the rain when it  rained you thought okay now is our  we need to refocus on on the set piece
FHSmSE1uCOw,385440,391600,you know everything is really crucial  and we're playing aside that's probably  number one in the world getting a set  piece you know sort of when it comes to
FHSmSE1uCOw,391600,397039,finals football they didn't adapt and  then the confidence went out they went  to the front they were hesitant at the
FHSmSE1uCOw,397039,402479,front they needed something a little bit  different and so i i guess in terms of  you know finals hardened they weren't
FHSmSE1uCOw,402479,409039,they weren't quite there and then the  momentum was with the crusaders the  whole night oh look you needed to go to
FHSmSE1uCOw,409039,415039,three man you need to go to five man you  need to mix it up quick  i mean i think actually if you think
FHSmSE1uCOw,415039,420960,about what's positive out of this i i  think it's the  the  beginning of the blues i remember in
FHSmSE1uCOw,420960,428240,1983 we went down to  um canterbury country we we were  probably the favorites and they just
FHSmSE1uCOw,428240,434319,pantsed us it was unbelievable and we  came back in 85 and won it but that was  the that was the right we're actually
FHSmSE1uCOw,434319,440479,not good enough yes and you've got to  keep working hard see kirstie i'll look  at this though and i'll look at this  crusaders group
FHSmSE1uCOw,440479,447280,and bryn hall is the only piece of the  puzzle that's leaving right now pablo  matters matera as well but it's not like
FHSmSE1uCOw,447280,453680,they haven't got an ethan blackadder  coming back next season so how do you  not see them winning another title we'll  read it well it's not not winning a
FHSmSE1uCOw,453680,460000,title but being the same side being the  team that goes into this situation  they'll be in part of the playoffs going
FHSmSE1uCOw,460000,466479,forward and incredibly difficult to beat  and the fact that they have transitioned  through some great players but you think
FHSmSE1uCOw,466479,473280,of the guys who didn't play this season  no joe moody in fact sam whitelock  missed games i just look at this and i
FHSmSE1uCOw,473280,479680,they are a remarkable franchise who  continue to set the standard and once  again in 12 months time we could be
FHSmSE1uCOw,479680,485039,sitting here once again talking about a  fantastic fantastic season
FHSmSE1uCOw,485039,491120,yeah well i think i think they've set  the standard and  but other teams are arising i think the
FHSmSE1uCOw,491120,496319,blues have had an amazing season they're  getting better they will be hurting like
FHSmSE1uCOw,496319,502160,crazy  and i think that when someone sets a  standard the auckland team probably did
FHSmSE1uCOw,502160,507440,in the 80s then the canterbury team took  over and the crusaders been setting the  standard for how long will it probably
FHSmSE1uCOw,507440,513039,20 years now so  other teams are now going right the  blues nearly got this season right and
FHSmSE1uCOw,513039,519440,they didn't get the last week or the  last 80 minutes the crusaders probably  had their best game last night and the
FHSmSE1uCOw,519440,525600,blues probably had their worst  that's you can't do that mills in finals  footy no you can't but i suppose
FHSmSE1uCOw,525600,531519,uh you know the terrifying thing is from  other franchises is now the crusaders  have got a blueprint of how to win in
FHSmSE1uCOw,531519,538240,this sort of way you know during the  season wasn't as fluent as perhaps they  would have wanted it to be but look how  they finish off so there's
FHSmSE1uCOw,538240,544160,another real massive sort of advantage  them going forward i agree with you i  think the blues i think there will be
FHSmSE1uCOw,544160,550320,confidence here they've got a hell of a  lot of young guys that are coming  through it's very cygnus you know  sullivan lamb dairy mackenzie evans you
FHSmSE1uCOw,550320,556240,know uh vikino and funaki that's that's  a big chunk that you know leon mcdonald  has has really you know given them some
FHSmSE1uCOw,556240,562880,experience so in terms of what you're  saying i i think they are i think  they'll be building nicely he's rotated  his squad um throughout the season so
FHSmSE1uCOw,562880,566160,it's it's been quite quite good
FHSmSE1uCOw,569260,574880,[Applause]  did we miss patrick tupolato we'll talk  about that in a minute because i think
FHSmSE1uCOw,574880,580160,you know when you talk about the lock  position i want to talk a bit more in  depth when we talk about the blues i do  want to touch on the stats though of the
FHSmSE1uCOw,580160,586000,game because sometimes the stats don't  tell the story these stats they tell the  story of this oh yeah and pure and
FHSmSE1uCOw,586000,591200,simple take them down straight away look  at that you won't have to suffer too  much longer you won't have to suffer too
FHSmSE1uCOw,591200,599200,much longer but bottom line you don't go  away  don't control territory eight minutes  and 47 seconds in your own 22 mils if
FHSmSE1uCOw,599200,605360,you're the blues that's the sort of  dominance you talk about in fact they  did well not to get beaten by more let's  be honest there were four or five tries
FHSmSE1uCOw,605360,611360,lesterfanganuku probably scored in the  first half it just you didn't see the  grounding on that grass but the big key
FHSmSE1uCOw,611360,617680,step there there it is 47 line in  accuracy you're not going to win a title  on that they go from making 220 plus
FHSmSE1uCOw,617680,622880,tackles one week to 115  i was impressed not just by the nature
FHSmSE1uCOw,622880,628240,of this win but also all of a sudden  they actually went off the page a little  bit and attacked mills this crusaders
FHSmSE1uCOw,628240,634560,side they went off the plays all of a  sudden richie moronga was at his very  very best where he got given a license
FHSmSE1uCOw,634560,641760,he adjusted his depth and we saw the  best of not just their forward pack  but david haveli leicester fanganuku
FHSmSE1uCOw,641760,648160,jack goody this was a complete  performance severe risk there wasn't one  man out in that field i didn't even talk
FHSmSE1uCOw,648160,655279,about will jordan yet and his balance on  attack remarkable remarkable all-round  game from the entire team well that's
FHSmSE1uCOw,655279,660800,absolutely right the balance of their  game so they they beat  the guys up front you know they've got
FHSmSE1uCOw,660800,667440,real parody out there and then they go  to the confidence of this but it needs  execution you need skill execution in in
FHSmSE1uCOw,667440,672560,weak and  conditions to be able to pull this sort  of stuff hard really for me he was
FHSmSE1uCOw,672560,677760,outstanding last night and and the  pressure that he took off moana did and  then when you sort of relied on you know
FHSmSE1uCOw,677760,682880,making sure you covered haveli and then  fire and knuckle pops up  and then you cover those guys and what
FHSmSE1uCOw,682880,688000,happens is the magician of mwama you  know he comes out of nowhere when he's  under pressure so threats all around but
FHSmSE1uCOw,688000,694560,the way they they went in there the  coaching staff you've got to take your  head off to them as well because you  know their game plan was right on point
FHSmSE1uCOw,694560,700079,even to the kicking game i mean they  beat the blues at that as well out  coached weren't they leo mcdonald said
FHSmSE1uCOw,700079,706880,it's like they had our playbook it's  like they knew where we were going  to ask you did they get the selections  right did they did when you think about
FHSmSE1uCOw,706880,713040,what they had coming off the bench now  i'm not sure where dalton papa ali was  health-wise going in but he was fit to
FHSmSE1uCOw,713040,719600,play and i know the district was made  late but kaltunukuafe  uh luke romano offered tuwanga fussy
FHSmSE1uCOw,719600,725519,should some of those got started did  they need more options you talk about  line out time i'll just throw this to  your fact they didn't have the
FHSmSE1uCOw,725519,730720,opportunity to change their line because  they didn't have a line at jumper on the  bench no james tucker for this game i
FHSmSE1uCOw,730720,735760,look at this did they get their  selection slightly wrong
FHSmSE1uCOw,735760,741200,ah retrospectively possibly i probably  would have played romano just because  you know whitelock's coming and he's
FHSmSE1uCOw,741200,747440,going to throw he's not a line-out  jumper yeah but it was it's not often  that it's the calmness under pressure
FHSmSE1uCOw,747440,754240,like i understand the stats i get all  that but there were moments for me like  that tried just before half-time mills
FHSmSE1uCOw,754240,759760,was a moment where the blues actually  you go in at half time and it's three  nil and i'm throwing everybody six nil
FHSmSE1uCOw,759760,764880,you're right you know six nil sorry yeah  so so the crusaders going here we just  threw everything at them and they kept
FHSmSE1uCOw,764880,770000,us out but that tried just before half  time they didn't win those moments so  i think
FHSmSE1uCOw,770000,775440,it's about pressure and the light losing  the line out is not about what you do  it's about someone being really calm in
FHSmSE1uCOw,775440,782079,there you know romano go in and push  someone you know and slow it down and  start confusing it himself what we did
FHSmSE1uCOw,782079,787680,is we just went from line out to lining  hoping it'd get better so i think that  was experience i was really surprised
FHSmSE1uCOw,787680,794480,that when offer came on the front row  got pumped a wee bit i don't know what  happened there i thought sam knock came
FHSmSE1uCOw,794480,801440,on and normally he does a decent job and  he made a few errors so there's just a  whole list of things that didn't go
FHSmSE1uCOw,801440,806720,their way and that's pressure i believe  mills the changes in the midfield though  taking off roger two of us check that
FHSmSE1uCOw,806720,814240,early when you're thinking to yourself  you need guys who can break a defensive  line  that has been the best in the last weeks
FHSmSE1uCOw,814240,820000,i haven't heard anything that he's  injured to bring on bryce team he's not  necessarily going to break if you want  solid and you're in front bryce seems
FHSmSE1uCOw,820000,827279,your man yeah but when you're trying to  break the line surely you're leaving him  out there and i guess when you look at  both sides but perhaps that does paint
FHSmSE1uCOw,827279,832399,it you know but you know one team all on  the same page the others when even when  you come off the bench you know what
FHSmSE1uCOw,832399,838320,what are we actually trying to change  you bring bryce he might i know they  went over the top to um over the line  out to him as well to try and change
FHSmSE1uCOw,838320,843839,that but that's still quite risky and it  was slow ball because it was it was  lobbed you know when you take roger two
FHSmSE1uCOw,843839,850560,of us check off and and then bring  romano in there what are you actually  trying to you know what are you trying  to come up with to try and beat this so
FHSmSE1uCOw,850560,856720,and then when the guys go out there they  pay like individuals and i think they're  right off their own but don't get me  wrong they were trying you know they
FHSmSE1uCOw,856720,862800,were going to go out there and try and  spark something adultery almost almost  did but unfortunately it looked almost
FHSmSE1uCOw,862800,867920,looked like there was nothing they're  going to go to next  after they're bombarded by a crusaders
FHSmSE1uCOw,867920,872959,outfit can i ask you a question jk you  talk about me no i'm going to ask you a  question you said it was i've had enough
FHSmSE1uCOw,872959,878880,of it you said it was their worst  uh uh performance of the season  what about the week before no for the
FHSmSE1uCOw,878880,884880,blues that was their worst performance  of the season did they have momentum on  the back end of their year going into
FHSmSE1uCOw,884880,890399,the final compared to the crusaders who  after they lost to the waratahs for me  were dominant they started winning by
FHSmSE1uCOw,890399,895519,big margins they started controlling  their destiny they started to bring all  of their players back into the fold the
FHSmSE1uCOw,895519,901040,blues i think in the back end i don't  think they were playing at their best  and maybe
FHSmSE1uCOw,901040,906480,maybe if you look at the course of the  season you go through all of their  results  they were lucky to win a number of games
FHSmSE1uCOw,906480,912720,they held on against the force two drop  goals one against the brumbies one  against the waratahs in the final moment
FHSmSE1uCOw,912720,919040,for me i look at it and go you know what  was this in some ways about coming in  and knowing exactly how the time you run
FHSmSE1uCOw,919040,924800,and the final 80 minutes of the season  no one get me get me if you can no no
FHSmSE1uCOw,924800,931440,the answer is that this young blue side  have never lived  12 games in a row winning they've never
FHSmSE1uCOw,931440,937680,been in a in a semi-final that they won  by one point late they're living this  experience where they're going wow
FHSmSE1uCOw,937680,943360,where's the crusaders they've been doing  this for 20 years they know they've got  enough experience that goes actually we
FHSmSE1uCOw,943360,949519,lost against waratahs i bet you the  leaders stood up and said you you and  you  got to pick your game up whereas the
FHSmSE1uCOw,949519,955279,blues are sort of living this wow we're  in the finals wow we're in the wow we're  winning well we're having we're unbeaten
FHSmSE1uCOw,955279,961120,at home  so they're actually not actually going  through the game in itself and you know  they're winning moments they go down to
FHSmSE1uCOw,961120,968079,the they go down to the crusaders and  they win down there now if you look at  it coldly the crusaders were coming back
FHSmSE1uCOw,968079,974240,hard yeah right and thank god the the  clock ran out but they're just living  these moments at the moment so they're
FHSmSE1uCOw,974240,979519,not even thinking about it everything's  good right when you're when you're  winning like the blues have when you  haven't won like that well you've got to
FHSmSE1uCOw,979519,985040,recognize though when it's not dominant  though and when you're not controlling  your destiny and i come back to the face  but you don't know your destiny mate
FHSmSE1uCOw,985040,990480,that's the issue you don't know your  destiny well i thought their destiny was  to win a title
FHSmSE1uCOw,991440,997680,when he's when leon macdonald looks  speculative he rotated his squad you  know the majority of the season i just
FHSmSE1uCOw,997680,1002720,don't think they had sort of that that  settled side leading into the finals  when you look at you know before the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1002720,1007920,quarter finals um you had different  props you know hodgman was here
FHSmSE1uCOw,1008000,1014720,you know  come on you know in the locks ramana was  still a starter is it dairy is it going  to be tucker to even your flankers you
FHSmSE1uCOw,1014720,1021120,know choking and then you lose something  like so when you when you're leading  into that and you're chopping and  changing even right lena last when nipa
FHSmSE1uCOw,1021120,1027280,comes in as a quarterfinal start to this  week you need settle you need guys to be  really set on and i think when you go
FHSmSE1uCOw,1027280,1034319,back to how he was rotating and trying  to get a real build a really big squad  to then go and do that he was possibly
FHSmSE1uCOw,1034319,1039520,hoping okay i can carry that on right  through the whole season but  unfortunately in finals football and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1039520,1045360,it's probably i mean this is just my  take on it you need those guys to say  hey i'm gonna be the number one the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1045360,1050480,number one prop i'm gonna be the number  one um you know  lock the number one flanker and look at
FHSmSE1uCOw,1050480,1057200,where they lost it look at where they  lost the game those first 10 minutes  were those key positions and i think  they were clearly in the end the second
FHSmSE1uCOw,1057200,1063440,best team in the competition the best  team ended up holding up the trophy at  the end of the season because that's  when it matters and that's when it
FHSmSE1uCOw,1063440,1069280,counts  pure and simple they got the job done  the crusaders because they were no  arguments for the course
FHSmSE1uCOw,1069280,1075039,of the course of the course of the  season absolutely no arguments there 22  out of the 36 all blacks uh squad
FHSmSE1uCOw,1075039,1080320,members were there last night does it  make it interesting in camp on tuesday
FHSmSE1uCOw,1080320,1086400,recovery mode oh they'll get off  the crusaders yeah they're a party mode  and deservedly so yeah deservedly so
FHSmSE1uCOw,1086400,1092240,well done for the first time to win that  trophy that'll mean a lot to them it  really will  it's amazing access right here in the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1092240,1098720,dressing rooms uh the moment that scott  barrett takes the trophy in how good is  that
FHSmSE1uCOw,1098720,1104320,something special you have to appreciate  that you know whether you're a crusaders  fan or not you have to appreciate that
FHSmSE1uCOw,1104320,1111039,yeah  but hey look there was one big one from
FHSmSE1uCOw,1111039,1116799,last night and that was the match  officials because we're not talking  about them that must be a good thing jk
FHSmSE1uCOw,1116799,1123840,yeah i spoke about being  in the pre-match i think that two years  ago he was our best referee by a long
FHSmSE1uCOw,1123840,1130080,shot one of the best in the world  because he brought his personality and  rift what was in front of him i thought
FHSmSE1uCOw,1130080,1135280,last year he got it got a bit  complicated for him maybe trying to  change his game or listen too much to
FHSmSE1uCOw,1135280,1142080,what other people wanted and he's back  to his very best the thing i loved about  last night was the common sense around
FHSmSE1uCOw,1142080,1150400,those shots now we've got to look after  the players heads mills we've got to do  that but i just thought both those  decisions were the right decisions and i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1150400,1157520,don't know two weeks ago or another ref  that would have happened  no absolutely not i mean the way he left
FHSmSE1uCOw,1157520,1163280,these situations i know it took a little  while look that's a stick figure isn't  there  nippo's sort of body height there jk you
FHSmSE1uCOw,1163280,1170720,did yeah you were there yeah i was happy  with that one  i mean reality is reality is is the fact  that i think a week ago
FHSmSE1uCOw,1170720,1178080,we could have seen a different result  and bottom line i think the common sense  you're talking about but the  understanding of what a rugby player is
FHSmSE1uCOw,1178080,1184080,and those are rugby movements guys  getting themselves and dipping into  positions and looking to go into contact
FHSmSE1uCOw,1184080,1190799,same thing again if you watch here jack  goody there are extenuating  circumstances david haveli puts him into
FHSmSE1uCOw,1190799,1197520,the path of jack could you but when you  end on same thing he had bended his legs  so he was looking to get himself there
FHSmSE1uCOw,1197520,1203280,in an attacking position now people go  well once again this is contact to the  head his own head as well but bottom
FHSmSE1uCOw,1203280,1209600,line i think he could quite easily have  been talked into this bin over keith  what i'd hope though jk and mills and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1209600,1216080,kirsten as there's no repercussions for  this all of a sudden work really is for  ben yeah because bottom line we've got a
FHSmSE1uCOw,1216080,1222400,great contest without your back mate  we've got you back exactly and i don't  want to hear from world rugby the fact  that i know you've met you haven't
FHSmSE1uCOw,1222400,1229520,followed the guidelines well clearly i  think he's worked out in his own head  and smartly there are rugby plays in the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1229520,1235120,game which end up in congress i hope i  hope i hope this is this is going to be  the case also when you know the t-series
FHSmSE1uCOw,1235120,1241120,happens because if it's if it's not  man we're going backwards so this is  this is now the standard i think you
FHSmSE1uCOw,1241120,1247679,being a kev's done a great job with that  i think there's a couple of little  things we need to realize  that ben did that were great
FHSmSE1uCOw,1247679,1252960,nepal's body position so he's fine  because the attacker goes in right but i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1252960,1260000,also think uh goodhue pulled out of it  when he realized that he was going to  have a head clash he just let it go and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1260000,1266080,he lost that contact and i think you  know we spoke about it mills a couple of  days ago
FHSmSE1uCOw,1266080,1272960,has it taken this long for the players  to understand technically what they need  to do when they're in a situation of
FHSmSE1uCOw,1272960,1276600,yellow a red card
FHSmSE1uCOw,1281600,1287600,well it's been 18 phenomenal rounds of  super rugby pacific do you remember who  you picked to take out the title we know  you you too
FHSmSE1uCOw,1287600,1294080,well if you need a reminder  if you need a reminder we're going back  to week one of the breakdown with our
FHSmSE1uCOw,1294080,1301520,predictions  we will pick our top four and who will  be the overall champion of super rugby
FHSmSE1uCOw,1301520,1307600,pacific uh just a note these were picked  before the first round of the  competition i haven't changed my mind
FHSmSE1uCOw,1307600,1312720,though i'm sticking with the blues jk  not just to make you happy there's no  way i'm not going to pick the blues
FHSmSE1uCOw,1312720,1318960,now if i so that's my emotional side if  you look at it i think the crusaders  will be stinging from last year
FHSmSE1uCOw,1318960,1325440,emotionally i've got to go with the  blues i think we'll miss patty dad i  think they're going to win they've built  a nice good squad young talent over the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1325440,1331840,last year or so and i think they take it  your blue second and i have to put the  crusaders in there i just look at this
FHSmSE1uCOw,1331840,1337039,and go you know what this is a long  season where the top eight is what  matters that's what's going to count you
FHSmSE1uCOw,1337039,1343919,make the playoffs i think all the new  zealand teams will do that and it'll  come down to getting three wins in a row
FHSmSE1uCOw,1345120,1350480,well we all got three out of four in uh  the wrong order though jeff you got two  out of four
FHSmSE1uCOw,1350480,1355679,but you had the right winner yeah that's  all that matters right  you get the right you get to find the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1355679,1362320,winner oh look look to be honest with  you i actually genuinely cared i i  wanted the blues to win last night and i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1362320,1367600,see that in the pre-match show because  i just thought for the game in that  crowd and for the moment in the season
FHSmSE1uCOw,1367600,1373280,they've had it and what it would do for  the future and and i think they achieved  that anyway but deep down at the start
FHSmSE1uCOw,1373280,1378400,of the year i'm looking at the crusader  squad i'm looking at the talent and i've  been there before look i you know i i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1378400,1386159,definitely and you mentioned the fact  that i missed patrick  i think when it came down to it at the  very last moment i think they did they
FHSmSE1uCOw,1386159,1392240,missed his in work in the engine room  and that's where it went for them uh  last night so i just got lucky let's be
FHSmSE1uCOw,1392240,1398880,honest i i seriously think you know i've  been around the blues a long long time  and auckland and i seriously think the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1398880,1406000,blues as a franchise have got their  together excuse the language i think  from the top right through the planning
FHSmSE1uCOw,1406000,1412640,they're doing the high performance  they're doing the management the ceo the  board i think that this is the beginning
FHSmSE1uCOw,1412640,1417919,that's why i'm not that worried about i  think there'll be great learnings like  you said mills um dolls from popularity
FHSmSE1uCOw,1417919,1426240,those types of players that come in here  paddy's got a few years so i think we're  going to see  a the next five or six years of blues
FHSmSE1uCOw,1426240,1432720,and crusaders going at it i know you  love the blues but there was another 11  teams playing in this competition super
FHSmSE1uCOw,1432720,1438159,rugby pacific really for the first time  uh we had two teams from the pacific as  well mills what did you think of the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1438159,1443919,competition as a whole even the  australians were better loved it i i  mean  you know at the very beginning it was
FHSmSE1uCOw,1443919,1450400,sort of unknown you know the the two  pacific sides coming into this  competition how will the aussies gonna  you know compete in considering you know
FHSmSE1uCOw,1450400,1456080,what's up in the last couple of years  but and the format was actually quite  you know was really good so
FHSmSE1uCOw,1456080,1461520,um going forward you know stick with it  i think we spoke about this a few weeks  ago goldie that you know stick with it
FHSmSE1uCOw,1461520,1468080,and and and keep at it um but the  balance and even the rugby was was quite
FHSmSE1uCOw,1468080,1475360,outstanding and i was very impressed  loved it i loved it i thought the  addition of  moana pacifica and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1475360,1481679,fijianduro was outstanding i thought  that probably won that competition from  a performance point of view but moana
FHSmSE1uCOw,1481679,1487760,pacific had so much bad luck  covered cancelled but i think they're  here to stay
FHSmSE1uCOw,1487760,1493279,i hope that  you know moana pacific to go back to to
FHSmSE1uCOw,1493279,1498640,tonga and samoa to play a bit more but  it was outstanding and i think the  format is getting really close i know
FHSmSE1uCOw,1498640,1504640,they're talking about leaving the  australians but i just think that's  paper tool that's the thing is super  rugby pacific here to stay jeff because
FHSmSE1uCOw,1504640,1511279,the chairman of rugby australia hamish  mclennan has come out and said uh all  bets are off past 2024. yeah look i've
FHSmSE1uCOw,1511279,1516799,got some big big moments coming up rugby  world cup's at home they're thinking and  trying to plot their way towards that
FHSmSE1uCOw,1516799,1522720,but i think this is just a pure power  play in terms of trying to negotiate  more funds for new uh for australia and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1522720,1528960,rugby  i'm bitterly disappointed to hear him  talking like that when you when you  commit to something for a couple of
FHSmSE1uCOw,1528960,1534400,years you commit to the fijian drawer  the moana pacifica sides how do you  think they feel right now hamish in
FHSmSE1uCOw,1534400,1541120,regards to the fact you've opened a door  for them and you're thinking about we're  going to walk away from this now because  it's in the best interest of us all we
FHSmSE1uCOw,1541120,1546480,think it is like an example australian  netball right is in the hole for four  million dollars they walked away from
FHSmSE1uCOw,1546480,1552320,the trans tasman competition with new  zealand and they've been worth worse off  financially that's the biggest sport in
FHSmSE1uCOw,1552320,1558159,australia there's a danger if you walk  away to be fair though we also need them  as well yeah we do need them and i get
FHSmSE1uCOw,1558159,1565039,where they're coming do we i think we do  need them more than they need well i  think you can see already there's been  greater interest in this competition in
FHSmSE1uCOw,1565039,1571360,super rugby than there was when we were  separated and apart okay we've created  something they've committed to it and
FHSmSE1uCOw,1571360,1577279,now they're talking about walking i  wanted to i'm really disappointed in  this because this tells me but i want to  challenge you i just want to challenge
FHSmSE1uCOw,1577279,1582480,that i totally agree with you by the way  i think hamish  well you're challenging me on this agree
FHSmSE1uCOw,1582480,1589760,let me finish let me finish i think  hamish puts the stuff in the media  before but the timing of this yeah
FHSmSE1uCOw,1589760,1596240,i gotcha but okay let's let's be cold  about it  my question back to both of you is do
FHSmSE1uCOw,1596240,1602480,you think  that they would suffer more by leaving  or we would suffer more i want them in
FHSmSE1uCOw,1602480,1609520,the competition i think they're  outstanding i love the brumbies i love  the reds i love the stuff i think it's  good right i think we need to keep
FHSmSE1uCOw,1609520,1615840,growing together however my question  back to both of you is who's going to  lose out on this if they want to go i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1615840,1621200,think it's the dumbest political  decision that they could make okay  they've got the world cup but after who
FHSmSE1uCOw,1621200,1627039,they're going to play  i mean their local competition so i  think that we want them to stay but why
FHSmSE1uCOw,1627039,1633279,are you throwing that into the media  because i don't think when push comes to  shove  they would be able to improve the game
FHSmSE1uCOw,1633279,1638399,the nrl is thriving it's outstanding  australian rules they do a great job
FHSmSE1uCOw,1638399,1644480,they're struggling already to get back  to where they need to get is this going  to happen mills or is it all talk i
FHSmSE1uCOw,1644480,1649679,think it's all talk well i'm  disappointed too i mean purely for that  fact that we spoke about moana and the
FHSmSE1uCOw,1649679,1655440,draw i mean  you know here we are these two teams for  all the all these things we spoke about
FHSmSE1uCOw,1655440,1662080,how they've been well where is the  funding for them over these last few  years and they've been you know crying  out for here here and there and there
FHSmSE1uCOw,1662080,1668640,they finally get into a competition and  hamish comes out and says well we're  going to leave them all  orwell and dandy these last couple of
FHSmSE1uCOw,1668640,1674240,years we'll just have them in there but  we'll throw them back out again because  we want to go on our own i think it's  just all talk i know this i think he's
FHSmSE1uCOw,1674240,1681600,the only one that thinks it's going to  happen even the australian players well  i think that we we need each other you  know this competition has been so so
FHSmSE1uCOw,1681600,1686720,great and to hear stuff like that come  out in the week of the final that is
FHSmSE1uCOw,1686720,1693039,that's just  crap and to see the improvements they've  made in the last 12 months from when  they couldn't they couldn't win a game
FHSmSE1uCOw,1693039,1698559,in super rugby a few years ago against  the new zealand size they picked up a  couple last year and all of a sudden  this year we've seen and the brumbies
FHSmSE1uCOw,1698559,1704480,proved it they can compete and go well  so bottom line you've started something  you've got to follow through with this
FHSmSE1uCOw,1704480,1711120,you've got to stick with what i think is  a formula in the future and then we'll  start talking about whether or not this  world club competition and your heineken
FHSmSE1uCOw,1711120,1717200,cup idea but bottom line we've started  something we've got to run the course  just to finish is this about
FHSmSE1uCOw,1717200,1723039,money because the way i read it he wants  a bit of our money  skye money that we pay the new zealand
FHSmSE1uCOw,1723039,1728799,for union is that right that's not good  i understand that that's why but i'm  sort of going hey don't you have to go
FHSmSE1uCOw,1728799,1734320,and do your own television deal so why  is i don't know what he's going to make  a great point jk you're going to be
FHSmSE1uCOw,1734320,1742000,stronger we've got to work together  don't play this out in the media we saw  how long it took us to get the silver  lake deal oh you don't go there sorry
FHSmSE1uCOw,1742000,1748240,we are gonna be talking all blacks very  very shortly but first i know last night  wasn't the result that everyone wanted

FHSmSE1uCOw,1984559,1991240,ones that have missed out  this could be one of the great all black  teams
FHSmSE1uCOw,2008790,2013679,[Music]  [Applause]
FHSmSE1uCOw,2014720,2024399,is  [Applause]
FHSmSE1uCOw,2024399,2029840,but no one said to pick themselves up as  much as you have right i mean bottom  line you think about some of the things  you've had to overcome the the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2029840,2036720,operations that the fact that uh coach  has been very open about sort of  answering questions that we have on the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2036720,2041720,guest section which is always fantastic  yeah it's lunchtime
FHSmSE1uCOw,2053050,2058480,[Music]  yeah great food great show for a great
FHSmSE1uCOw,2058480,2063599,day for the first all black squad  announcement of 2022 i want to know how  close did you get with your list you had
FHSmSE1uCOw,2063599,2069839,your list excuse me  i think there's a bigger question what  what happened to my invite guys  there's only one of them there's only
FHSmSE1uCOw,2069839,2075919,one of them hey what's going on  like  how good did that was there's pali  summer as well
FHSmSE1uCOw,2075919,2081679,as well ah there wasn't actually it was  just chopped through oh it was delicious  i can't believe you brushed me
FHSmSE1uCOw,2081679,2088560,wrong mel's had three plates anyway  let's take a look at the squad there  were some notable omissions uh no cullen
FHSmSE1uCOw,2088560,2093919,grace tj perrinata brad webber ethan  degroote  luke jacobson to name a few but there
FHSmSE1uCOw,2093919,2099599,was some also some exciting inclusions  weren't there jeff yeah absolutely all  of a sudden you talk about new all
FHSmSE1uCOw,2099599,2104880,blacks roger two of us the chef course  lister nuku who performed beautifully  last night stephen peter fetter maybe
FHSmSE1uCOw,2104880,2112160,gets his opportunity peter gus soakula  was the interesting one for me mills you  know we talked about a little bit on the  night bottom line they're looking him as
FHSmSE1uCOw,2112160,2118960,as a six who can play eight or clearly  so i you know i look at that and they've  got a clear plan i think going forward
FHSmSE1uCOw,2118960,2125119,but i think last night made things very  very interesting you're talking about  matchups  before you answer that sorry to
FHSmSE1uCOw,2125119,2131520,interrupt but are we are we are we over  this six that could play eight i mean  are we seriously
FHSmSE1uCOw,2131520,2136960,considering that again or are we just  going to go there's two sixes pick one  of them there's two eights pick one of
FHSmSE1uCOw,2136960,2143280,them well i think they're going to do  that so you think so has been picked to  go on the bench no or it can italy can
FHSmSE1uCOw,2143280,2149920,do that you can do that but i think  they're looking at they're looking for  someone who's got size who can carry  right are you picking akirawani at six
FHSmSE1uCOw,2149920,2155760,after last night  uh yep i am  i am um and i think
FHSmSE1uCOw,2155760,2161599,i think hosk hoskins  i don't know what you think mills but i  thought he was the best in a losing side
FHSmSE1uCOw,2161599,2167599,i thought he tried really really hard  did some really good things put some  pressure on he's starting to tackle very
FHSmSE1uCOw,2167599,2173839,very well so you're selecting a variety  savior at number eight for the all  blacks in the first test against ireland  no i didn't say that oh you didn't say
FHSmSE1uCOw,2173839,2179359,that okay so where is it where does he  fit in the mix  once you're going you do realize there's  only eight forwards
FHSmSE1uCOw,2179359,2185200,there's only eight people there's only  i'd only have three but anyway they call  that sevens
FHSmSE1uCOw,2185200,2192320,i mean these are these are debates i  think all of a sudden they've got very  interesting for me mills the midfield  yesterday
FHSmSE1uCOw,2192320,2198320,roger two of us and rico yuwani  i don't know why they took roger off but  we spoke mills before the game and
FHSmSE1uCOw,2198320,2203599,you've played midfield as well as  fullback we spoke about combinations  pre-games saying roger touhou
FHSmSE1uCOw,2203599,2209280,ruka yuwani good you or javili because  you've only like the test is next week
FHSmSE1uCOw,2209280,2215119,people yeah you don't have time to go oh  you guys got to get together so i think  coverty was the player of the day last
FHSmSE1uCOw,2215119,2221440,night would you'd have to sort of pencil  them in are you taking stock on this  game from last night though i think you  have to i think what's come out of this
FHSmSE1uCOw,2221440,2227680,game more well or not is the fact that  the mental side of things okay the next  level with the next step in terms of the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2227680,2234800,all blacks uh in terms of you know  having that mental hardness and also the  experience it's got to be a big factor
FHSmSE1uCOw,2234800,2240800,because you've seen guys um that have  been there we're talking about the  crusaders before they've been there done  that they stepped up to another level
FHSmSE1uCOw,2240800,2247920,compared to guys that they're on the  other side that have been there for one  two maybe years or not even been there  that experience and that mental capacity
FHSmSE1uCOw,2247920,2253839,you've got to go to that sort of  harveeli for me  man from a physical point of view and
FHSmSE1uCOw,2253839,2260240,his ability to be able to take the  pressure off moana he was amazing last  night so if he's at 12 for the all  blacks where does that leave will jordan
FHSmSE1uCOw,2260240,2265839,jordy barrett debate  well i think barrett has to be a  fullback now he's got to be on the on  the field regardless of what it is i
FHSmSE1uCOw,2265839,2272400,think what harvey has established now is  he's the number one 12 in terms of what  he can do his kicking game is awesome um
FHSmSE1uCOw,2272400,2277680,and then when you go for a guy like this  um you know he compliments it as well  because he's hard running from the back
FHSmSE1uCOw,2277680,2283119,he's his ability to be able to kick for  space he just adds another threat his  goal kicking as well okay will jordan
FHSmSE1uCOw,2283119,2288320,he's been awesome isn't he jeff and i  know you've loved him at the back but  now he's a probably a winner now it
FHSmSE1uCOw,2288320,2293920,could be given the way that harvey has  played okay so  do they play the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2293920,2300480,blues type defense where bowdoin goes to  the backfield because one thing that  geordi does need to
FHSmSE1uCOw,2300480,2306480,probably improve the season it is out of  hand  kicking into space when he's coming back  that would probably be his biggest work
FHSmSE1uCOw,2306480,2313119,on goldie so one of one of the things  you'd like to see him do better but do  you just play as his brother back there
FHSmSE1uCOw,2313119,2318800,and put him in the front line  defensively i think you've got the  luxury of doing both i think this is  where you've got god when you say hey
FHSmSE1uCOw,2318800,2324079,well you go you go up we can chop and  change and put him put him back there  because you know for a hard running game
FHSmSE1uCOw,2324079,2330800,you might want to you know play that  sort of you know in the last 20 minutes  or the first you know last 20 minutes of  the first half but have body back there
FHSmSE1uCOw,2330800,2335839,while we're trying to win that kicking  jaw i think that's a real strength of  the all blacks now when you put guys
FHSmSE1uCOw,2335839,2342720,like that in there that you can swap  them around in the defensive effort i've  got to ask this question jk when you  think about the nature of the contest
FHSmSE1uCOw,2342720,2348640,last night and we knew it was going to  be tight but one aspect of the game the  line out almost framed and changed the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2348640,2353920,game  and so it was it was difficult for some  of the blues players to do the things
FHSmSE1uCOw,2353920,2360720,that they've done well that they will be  asked to do in the all blacks so now i  start looking at and going  is it pure and simply that players are
FHSmSE1uCOw,2360720,2366880,maybe a little bit more under pressure  in terms of their initial performance if  you get the first chance they'll trust
FHSmSE1uCOw,2366880,2372160,and have loyalty to the guys who played  well for them last year they'll go but  you know what we've got some other guys
FHSmSE1uCOw,2372160,2377520,in a big game that stood up and played  well you've got your battery i've  written it down the last 30 seconds i've
FHSmSE1uCOw,2377520,2382720,got my back line um i think  now the other question back to both of
FHSmSE1uCOw,2382720,2388720,you is  if we don't play roger two of us a check  now when are we gonna play when are we  gonna know so this is what i think
FHSmSE1uCOw,2388720,2395200,happens  barrett javeli iwani barrett  haven't decided on the wing chun rts on
FHSmSE1uCOw,2395200,2401520,the bench i think i still think it's too  soon  i think well there's 12 tests to go
FHSmSE1uCOw,2401520,2407760,yeah what are you going to know but  bottom line they want to beat ireland  to go to the world cup that's that's  going to be the biggie i
FHSmSE1uCOw,2407760,2414480,they've got to get back to winning ways  in this in this next three test matches  you know and do the coaches say well  we've got to put our absolute best team
FHSmSE1uCOw,2414480,2420000,there don't try and tinker things around  or experiment until we win these and  convincingly because
FHSmSE1uCOw,2420000,2426480,they're under the pump last year in  terms of the results they have they've  got to get back to winning ways and this  is a good chance for them to actually
FHSmSE1uCOw,2426480,2431920,establish a settled side for these next  three tests and make sure it's a winning  one i need them to be two nil up going
FHSmSE1uCOw,2431920,2437359,into last game exactly  that's exactly what they'll be hoping to  be doing that the first job is to give
FHSmSE1uCOw,2437359,2442480,the guys who are in for they didn't like  my backline  yeah  that's fine i mean it's an all black
FHSmSE1uCOw,2442480,2447920,background he's on the way to be good  will jordan's on the wing at the stage  so you want to see the guys that are
FHSmSE1uCOw,2447920,2454000,informed super rugby forum well they  performed last night you'd like to think  lester fanganuku i tell you what he was
FHSmSE1uCOw,2454000,2459680,awesome he was awesome the hard thing is  richie manga was awesome too and we know  how good bodenberry has been i don't
FHSmSE1uCOw,2459680,2466560,know in every position did the crusaders  outplay the blues in every position  correct they did didn't they correct
FHSmSE1uCOw,2466560,2472319,interesting nine of those uh crusaders  in the all blacks as well uh and a few  that will be chomping in a bit to get
FHSmSE1uCOw,2472319,2478560,back in that environment trivia time  remember you can play this at home as  well your question for today and i'm
FHSmSE1uCOw,2478560,2483920,sure these guys are looking forward to  it how many all blacks are playing in  major league rugby
FHSmSE1uCOw,2483920,2489359,the american competition of course  well he's he's signed all of them up  there so he would know yeah that's he's

FHSmSE1uCOw,2510700,2516400,[Music]  no my hockey my welcome back into the  breakdown well it is trivia time we gave
FHSmSE1uCOw,2516400,2524720,you the question before we went to the  break how many all blacks are playing in  the mlr major league rugby in america
FHSmSE1uCOw,2524720,2530079,jeff we have  we had no idea let's be honest well is  this a team effort here oh yeah yeah
FHSmSE1uCOw,2530079,2536770,yeah yeah  i'll be just throwing out a number it's  a team effort but i was the blues
FHSmSE1uCOw,2536770,2546070,[Laughter]
FHSmSE1uCOw,2546160,2551520,no i got knocked out early  okay if you three have absolutely no
FHSmSE1uCOw,2551520,2558800,idea let's take a look how many all  blacks are playing in the mlr  there they are oh there you go most of
FHSmSE1uCOw,2558800,2565039,them playing for rugby three of them  well we hit we had three down we had  three

FHSmSE1uCOw,2576560,2584400,behind the scenes content highlights  replays of every game sign up for free  on there network dot com uh but time now
FHSmSE1uCOw,2584400,2590640,to head to one of our black ferns  chelsea simple charles um it has been a  fantastic couple of weeks for the black
FHSmSE1uCOw,2590640,2597440,firms well done on yesterday's  performance as well i must feel pretty  good inside that squad at the moment
FHSmSE1uCOw,2597440,2604560,yeah definitely  kirsty it was a pretty unreal three  weeks  obviously much needed for us
FHSmSE1uCOw,2604560,2610960,obviously coming off the back of end of  year tour last year we we didn't end the  year how we would have liked and um our
FHSmSE1uCOw,2610960,2618400,teams had a massive shake up this year  whole new management uh new captain um a  whole lot of fresh faces in the team so
FHSmSE1uCOw,2618400,2624640,uh yeah to step up and play these these  three tests at home we don't get home  tests very often so that was special as
FHSmSE1uCOw,2624640,2629839,well but to um to put those performances  in place um
FHSmSE1uCOw,2629839,2635119,just in time before world cup feels  pretty good still got a long way to go  but yeah it was an awesome three weeks
FHSmSE1uCOw,2635119,2640880,with the girls chelsea so many players  got so many opportunities in the course  of these three test matches but only the
FHSmSE1uCOw,2640880,2646839,team will know you would have done your  reviews do you feel the team improved  game on
FHSmSE1uCOw,2646839,2653119,game oh yeah definitely goldie um  our game plan has changed tremendously
FHSmSE1uCOw,2653119,2658720,uh obviously new coaching staff and it's  been a challenge challenge for us  because we've kind of played the same
FHSmSE1uCOw,2658720,2665760,rugby for such a long time and  and it has been a massive shake-up so  we weren't expecting us to be perfect um
FHSmSE1uCOw,2665760,2671200,in the first game or the second game or  even in our final game and we're  definitely still building and
FHSmSE1uCOw,2671200,2677200,there's still a way for us to go to be  able to play the style that wayne smith  wants us to play um but it was pretty
FHSmSE1uCOw,2677200,2682720,cool seeing the improvement um from the  first camp we had at the start of this  year
FHSmSE1uCOw,2682720,2688000,our camps throughout the year and then  from the first game against aussie to  the performance we put out last night
FHSmSE1uCOw,2688000,2694640,against usa was was um amazing and it  just makes me and the team excited
FHSmSE1uCOw,2694640,2701280,for  how much growth we've still got left to  do and and where we can get to um  playing this style of rugby
FHSmSE1uCOw,2701280,2707599,i love how you say new coaching stuff  you've got the the genius of all  geniuses there  uh in wayne smith but the thing i
FHSmSE1uCOw,2707599,2713520,noticed the most charles from the  northern hemisphere to this game was a  completely different defensive
FHSmSE1uCOw,2713520,2718880,confidence  it looked like you weren't panicking  northern tour last year saw people
FHSmSE1uCOw,2718880,2724160,jumping out of the line closing other  people drifting but you looked really  really confident getting off the line
FHSmSE1uCOw,2724160,2731200,fast really united  have you been working on different  systems around your defence
FHSmSE1uCOw,2731200,2738560,yeah we've tweaked quite a few things on  our defense um we have a really good  defense coach and wesley clark and he's
FHSmSE1uCOw,2738560,2743680,been doing some outstanding work  with us but i think jk a lot of it also
FHSmSE1uCOw,2743680,2750240,comes down to the fact that we're now  um fully contracted athletes which means
FHSmSE1uCOw,2750240,2755280,we're a hell of a lot more fit than we  were the end of your tour last year and
FHSmSE1uCOw,2755280,2761200,um  you know how it is on the rugby field  the more fit you are the more you can  stick to your game plan and keep your
FHSmSE1uCOw,2761200,2768160,connections so  defense  you don't just have to fly out fly over  the line um because you're short we're
FHSmSE1uCOw,2768160,2775359,actually  able to get around the corner and stay  in the game for a lot longer so  i think the definitely the work that wiz
FHSmSE1uCOw,2775359,2781440,is doing the confidence in our own  ability as players now and and the  coaching staff really empowering us is
FHSmSE1uCOw,2781440,2786640,helping and um obviously yeah just our  fitness is definitely helping josh you
FHSmSE1uCOw,2786640,2792720,talk about the fitness the better you  are you know the um and also fully  contract in there but that creates
FHSmSE1uCOw,2792720,2798240,competition  you know it's been a really good  environment and you know you can see  that you can sense it
FHSmSE1uCOw,2798240,2805359,how hungry is the competition within the  team because there's only a few spots up  for grabs when it comes to starting 15.
FHSmSE1uCOw,2805359,2811599,yeah i mean i've been involved in this  team for over 10 years now and the  competition has never been this healthy
FHSmSE1uCOw,2811599,2816640,um in my opinion  the the thing with the team this year  with smithy coming on board is that
FHSmSE1uCOw,2816640,2823280,everyone is just purely picked on form  nothing that you've done in the past or  or any of your history um which gives
FHSmSE1uCOw,2823280,2829680,every girl an opportunity to put their  best foot forward and put their hand up  to be selected for world cup and i mean
FHSmSE1uCOw,2829680,2834720,that's what you're saying we saw um  young 18 year old sylvia brunt um make
FHSmSE1uCOw,2834720,2840319,her debut this year we saw arihiana  having first started at number nine um
FHSmSE1uCOw,2840319,2846240,things that in the last kind of five or  six years  haven't happened as much so
FHSmSE1uCOw,2846240,2852000,the team being picked on for me and  those kind of selections being made has  given given all the younger girls and
FHSmSE1uCOw,2852000,2859520,the less experienced skills um it's  given them hope i guess  and and it's just showing everyone that
FHSmSE1uCOw,2859520,2866880,no one's safe  um you have to be playing inform rugby  to be selected in this team and and if
FHSmSE1uCOw,2866880,2871920,you're not playing  in form rugby  you've got no shot at the world cup so
FHSmSE1uCOw,2871920,2878000,it's just it's really healthy  competition and it's exciting and  everyone's on their toes and it's just
FHSmSE1uCOw,2878000,2883839,the hunger and the team is is better  than ever because at the end of this  tour you know all the girls are talking
FHSmSE1uCOw,2883839,2890559,about is getting back into our hubs  training harder really um for our  upcoming trial match um in about a
FHSmSE1uCOw,2890559,2896640,month's time um ready to show why  each of us deserves to be in the world  cup team so
FHSmSE1uCOw,2896640,2901839,it's only going to get better we're  going to be fitter we're going to be  stronger and yeah i guess the the best
FHSmSE1uCOw,2901839,2906960,the best team in wayne smith's size will  be selected at the end of the day  charles you're going great guns thank
FHSmSE1uCOw,2906960,2913520,you so much for coming on our program  and congratulations on picking out the  pacific four series undefeated
FHSmSE1uCOw,2913520,2918960,cheers guys thanks for having me thanks  so much chelsea simple um absolutely  fabulous before
