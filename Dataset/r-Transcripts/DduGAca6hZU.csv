DduGAca6hZU,36640,40320,that's just a theory right a theory a
DduGAca6hZU,40320,42880,theory a theory
DduGAca6hZU,42880,47120,[Music]
DduGAca6hZU,47120,50320,hello internet welcome to game theory
DduGAca6hZU,50320,52000,the show that's been popular for 11
DduGAca6hZU,52000,53920,years but still hasn't landed a movie
DduGAca6hZU,53920,55520,deal don't know why i felt like
DduGAca6hZU,55520,57199,mentioning it here on a completely
DduGAca6hZU,57199,58800,unrelated note a few weeks ago we
DduGAca6hZU,58800,60239,finally saw the release of poppy
DduGAca6hZU,60239,63039,playtime chapter 2 flying a web and this
DduGAca6hZU,63039,65600,thing was longer than a tech demo so hey
DduGAca6hZU,65600,67520,big wins over part one but no the team
DduGAca6hZU,67520,68960,wasn't content to stop there hoppy
DduGAca6hZU,68960,70880,playtime's newest chapter went above and
DduGAca6hZU,70880,73119,beyond requiring players to master not
DduGAca6hZU,73119,75840,just one but two different gameplay
DduGAca6hZU,75840,79119,styles whack-a-mole and simon says
DduGAca6hZU,79119,80240,yellow
DduGAca6hZU,80240,82159,we're duh violet
DduGAca6hZU,82159,84240,every game is required to have a simon
DduGAca6hZU,84240,86240,says segment for some reason i'm of
DduGAca6hZU,86240,87680,course being facetious about the whole
DduGAca6hZU,87680,89520,thing this new chapter actually offered
DduGAca6hZU,89520,91840,a lot of awesome stuff cool puzzles
DduGAca6hZU,91840,94320,thrilling chases and an oversized plush
DduGAca6hZU,94320,96720,toy failing to pull a lever
DduGAca6hZU,96720,98880,the animation is so adorable i could sit
DduGAca6hZU,98880,100479,here and watch that all day oh and there
DduGAca6hZU,100479,102799,are also collectible trophies now really
DduGAca6hZU,102799,104479,challenging collectible trophies that'll
DduGAca6hZU,104479,106479,push you to the limits of your gamer
DduGAca6hZU,106479,108479,senses any secret trophies or anything
DduGAca6hZU,108479,109840,that we see up here i need secret
DduGAca6hZU,109840,113040,trophies secret trophies
DduGAca6hZU,113040,114720,but we all know why we're really here
DduGAca6hZU,114720,116240,it's not for the gameplay innovation or
DduGAca6hZU,116240,117759,the collectibles it's for the hidden
DduGAca6hZU,117759,119920,notes and cryptic clues ladies and
DduGAca6hZU,119920,122560,gentlemen we have ourselves some lore to
DduGAca6hZU,122560,125680,decipher and spoiler alert poppy isn't
DduGAca6hZU,125680,127759,who we thought she was first here's what
DduGAca6hZU,127759,129039,you need to know to understand today's
DduGAca6hZU,129039,130959,theory puppy playtime chapter 1 focused
DduGAca6hZU,130959,132560,on us the player returning to an
DduGAca6hZU,132560,134400,abandoned toy factory in order to save
DduGAca6hZU,134400,135840,some employees that went missing there
DduGAca6hZU,135840,138000,10 years ago we're told via mysterious
DduGAca6hZU,138000,140239,note that we have to find the flower
DduGAca6hZU,140239,142080,several puzzles and one giant muppet
DduGAca6hZU,142080,143599,chase later we find the flower in the
DduGAca6hZU,143599,146000,form of a giant wall mural of a poppy
DduGAca6hZU,146000,148160,inside is a replica of a house and a
DduGAca6hZU,148160,150560,doll named poppy playtime locked away
DduGAca6hZU,150560,152560,inside of a glass case and of course we
DduGAca6hZU,152560,153920,set her free without a second thought
DduGAca6hZU,153920,155200,because players in video games have
DduGAca6hZU,155200,157280,never seen a horror movie before anyway
DduGAca6hZU,157280,159599,chapter 2 picks up immediately afterward
DduGAca6hZU,159599,161440,poppy agrees to help us activate a train
DduGAca6hZU,161440,163040,that'll help us get out of the factory
DduGAca6hZU,163040,164959,so much for wanting to help save those
DduGAca6hZU,164959,166800,missing employees but hey if a creepy
DduGAca6hZU,166800,168640,talk and doll starts offering me ways to
DduGAca6hZU,168640,170720,not be around the creepy talking doll
DduGAca6hZU,170720,172800,i'm gonna take that offer but of course
DduGAca6hZU,172800,175120,things are never quite that easy mommy
DduGAca6hZU,175120,177680,longlegs a giant stretchy toy spider
DduGAca6hZU,177680,179519,takes poppy hostage and forces us to
DduGAca6hZU,179519,181040,play three mini-games in her game
DduGAca6hZU,181040,182879,station in order to unlock each part of
DduGAca6hZU,182879,184879,the train's code eventually we break out
DduGAca6hZU,184879,186400,of our games which causes her to go
DduGAca6hZU,186400,188400,complete sicko mode and chase us through
DduGAca6hZU,188400,190720,a narrow escape sequence where have i
DduGAca6hZU,190720,192480,seen something like that before in the
DduGAca6hZU,192480,194159,end she gets caught in a grinder and her
DduGAca6hZU,194159,196319,remains are dragged away by a mysterious
DduGAca6hZU,196319,198480,claw we rescue poppy get on the train
DduGAca6hZU,198480,200879,but surprise surprise she betrays us
DduGAca6hZU,200879,202800,crashing the train and forcing us even
DduGAca6hZU,202800,205280,deeper into the factory so those are the
DduGAca6hZU,205280,206720,highlights from the chapter but we're
DduGAca6hZU,206720,208640,still left with a lot of overarching
DduGAca6hZU,208640,211040,questions who are we where are these
DduGAca6hZU,211040,212640,missing employees we're so concerned
DduGAca6hZU,212640,214879,about what's the true nature of the toys
DduGAca6hZU,214879,216959,and who's secretly pulling the strings
DduGAca6hZU,216959,219280,behind all of this well i think i have
DduGAca6hZU,219280,221200,the answers to each and every one of
DduGAca6hZU,221200,223040,those questions and the last one is
DduGAca6hZU,223040,224879,probably the best place to start as i
DduGAca6hZU,224879,226400,just talked about after defeating mommy
DduGAca6hZU,226400,228239,we see her remains get dragged away by a
DduGAca6hZU,228239,230799,mysterious claw
DduGAca6hZU,230799,234480,no not burn traps claw but also yeah
DduGAca6hZU,234480,236799,kind of burn traps claw see the hand we
DduGAca6hZU,236799,238560,see pool mommy way is very different
DduGAca6hZU,238560,239760,from all the other designs that we've
DduGAca6hZU,239760,241519,encountered in the game so far most of
DduGAca6hZU,241519,242799,the toys that we fight are brightly
DduGAca6hZU,242799,244799,colored made of plastic or fur and you
DduGAca6hZU,244799,247200,know look like actual toys this thing
DduGAca6hZU,247200,249200,though is dark mechanical and could poke
DduGAca6hZU,249200,250959,your eye out it's like an erector set on
DduGAca6hZU,250959,253360,steroids and that's not all if you zoom
DduGAca6hZU,253360,255280,in and enhance the image of the claw you
DduGAca6hZU,255280,256720,can actually make out that there's
DduGAca6hZU,256720,259199,organic material mixed in there bones
DduGAca6hZU,259199,261440,and maybe even some veins mixed in with
DduGAca6hZU,261440,262720,the metallic parts so yeah the
DduGAca6hZU,262720,264960,comparison to spring trap burn trap call
DduGAca6hZU,264960,266320,them whatever you want it isn't that
DduGAca6hZU,266320,267600,much of a joke but what is this
DduGAca6hZU,267600,269120,biomechanic hybrid doing within the
DduGAca6hZU,269120,270960,context of poppy well back in chapter
DduGAca6hZU,270960,273040,one we discovered the final vhs tape
DduGAca6hZU,273040,274240,which catalogued the results of
DduGAca6hZU,274240,276960,experiment one zero zero six nicknamed
DduGAca6hZU,276960,279919,the prototype final log in relation
DduGAca6hZU,279919,282960,experiment one 1006
DduGAca6hZU,282960,284800,the prototype coordination and
DduGAca6hZU,284800,286639,cooperation is evidently within his
DduGAca6hZU,286639,288560,skill set as well as the skill set of
DduGAca6hZU,288560,290639,all other experiments of his type this
DduGAca6hZU,290639,292080,along with a death screen that said
DduGAca6hZU,292080,294960,experiment 1006 isn't he wonderful led
DduGAca6hZU,294960,296400,us to believe in a previous theory that
DduGAca6hZU,296400,298880,our big blue boy huggy wuggy was the
DduGAca6hZU,298880,300880,prototype since you know he was kind of
DduGAca6hZU,300880,302160,the only character that we met in
DduGAca6hZU,302160,304160,chapter one occam's razor and all that
DduGAca6hZU,304160,305600,however take a look at the hand on the
DduGAca6hZU,305600,307680,tv screen that we see during that vhs
DduGAca6hZU,307680,309759,recording look familiar we see that hand
DduGAca6hZU,309759,312000,appear again and yet another vhs tape in
DduGAca6hZU,312000,314720,chapter two log code zero eight five
DduGAca6hZU,314720,318160,zero two in relation experiment one zero
DduGAca6hZU,318160,320720,zero six the prototype the prototype
DduGAca6hZU,320720,322720,seems to possess an unprecedented level
DduGAca6hZU,322720,325039,of intelligence beyond that of all other
DduGAca6hZU,325039,327039,test subjects as well as an alarming
DduGAca6hZU,327039,328720,willingness to commit violence
DduGAca6hZU,328720,331840,experiment 1170 huggy wuggy remains the
DduGAca6hZU,331840,333680,optimal outcome due to his sufficient
DduGAca6hZU,333680,335520,intelligence paired with maximum
DduGAca6hZU,335520,337919,obedience obviously this outright tells
DduGAca6hZU,337919,340639,us that huggy isn't experiment 1006 and
DduGAca6hZU,340639,342560,that it's instead the owner of this
DduGAca6hZU,342560,344479,mysterious claw so that's what the
DduGAca6hZU,344479,346320,prototype is but what makes it so
DduGAca6hZU,346320,348320,special well during that same vhs tape
DduGAca6hZU,348320,349919,we also hear how the prototype takes
DduGAca6hZU,349919,352000,apart an alarm clock and uses it to make
DduGAca6hZU,352000,354400,a laser pointer in short it's smart and
DduGAca6hZU,354400,356160,it's able to repurpose things which
DduGAca6hZU,356160,358240,would explain mommy's concern in this
DduGAca6hZU,358240,360560,moment
DduGAca6hZU,363600,365840,she's gonna be reused and repurposed by
DduGAca6hZU,365840,367600,this entity in order to help the monster
DduGAca6hZU,367600,369199,escape kind of makes you wonder if the
DduGAca6hZU,369199,371120,veins and bones or how this creature was
DduGAca6hZU,371120,373199,originally designed or maybe that's what
DduGAca6hZU,373199,374479,happened to all the other missing
DduGAca6hZU,374479,376639,employees their bodies were added to the
DduGAca6hZU,376639,378400,machine it's interesting in our last
DduGAca6hZU,378400,380319,theory we predicted that mommy longlegs
DduGAca6hZU,380319,382000,would be adding the bodies of dead toys
DduGAca6hZU,382000,384080,to herself in order to become stronger
DduGAca6hZU,384080,386080,we were right about the concept just
DduGAca6hZU,386080,387759,looks like we were wrong about who it
DduGAca6hZU,387759,389360,applied to as for how this thing is
DduGAca6hZU,389360,390960,going to wind up looking anyone remember
DduGAca6hZU,390960,392880,sid from toy story 1 sounds like we
DduGAca6hZU,392880,394800,might have found one of his creations so
DduGAca6hZU,394800,396520,right now it looks like the prototype
DduGAca6hZU,396520,398960,1006 is gonna be our overarching villain
DduGAca6hZU,398960,400639,for the franchise taking pieces and
DduGAca6hZU,400639,402560,parts of the other toys and maybe even
DduGAca6hZU,402560,404800,pieces and parts of other people to grow
DduGAca6hZU,404800,406960,stronger that being said one toy that
DduGAca6hZU,406960,408319,doesn't appear to have been added to the
DduGAca6hZU,408319,410560,prototype yet is huggy wuggy he may not
DduGAca6hZU,410560,412240,have appeared explicitly in this chapter
DduGAca6hZU,412240,414479,but hints of him are hidden around when
DduGAca6hZU,414479,415680,you go into the chapter's water
DduGAca6hZU,415680,417360,treatment room if you look carefully you
DduGAca6hZU,417360,419199,can see some blue fur that's scattered
DduGAca6hZU,419199,421199,around the pipes alongside trails of
DduGAca6hZU,421199,423120,blood this appears to be the room that
DduGAca6hZU,423120,424720,huggy fell through at the end of the
DduGAca6hZU,424720,426479,last chapter and would seem to imply
DduGAca6hZU,426479,428400,that huggy picked himself up and went
DduGAca6hZU,428400,430960,full-on sus mode by venting away waiting
DduGAca6hZU,430960,433039,to return until a future chapter which
DduGAca6hZU,433039,434800,honestly makes sense he can't die yet
DduGAca6hZU,434800,436080,he's basically the mascot of the
DduGAca6hZU,436080,438720,franchise who even cares about poppy at
DduGAca6hZU,438720,441919,this point i mean me i do because lore
DduGAca6hZU,441919,443199,but i feel like i'm definitely in the
DduGAca6hZU,443199,445520,minority on that one speaking of poppy
DduGAca6hZU,445520,447599,let's talk about her shall we i mean it
DduGAca6hZU,447599,449440,is her name on the title screen after
DduGAca6hZU,449440,451440,all this isn't kissy missy playtime or
DduGAca6hZU,451440,454080,cat b playtime you know well mere hours
DduGAca6hZU,454080,455680,after chapter 2 came out the fan
DduGAca6hZU,455680,457360,community did what the fan community
DduGAca6hZU,457360,459599,gonna do they dug into the game files
DduGAca6hZU,459599,461599,and by doing so they discovered an early
DduGAca6hZU,461599,463680,build of this chapter hidden away and
DduGAca6hZU,463680,465280,while the game itself is still basically
DduGAca6hZU,465280,467280,the same the end is where things get
DduGAca6hZU,467280,469280,real interesting normally you get on the
DduGAca6hZU,469280,470800,train and poppy gives you this sinister
DduGAca6hZU,470800,472319,speech about how you're not allowed to
DduGAca6hZU,472319,474000,leave she betrays us and sends us
DduGAca6hZU,474000,475440,hurdling deeper into the factory for
DduGAca6hZU,475440,477759,reasons that are kept pretty darn vague
DduGAca6hZU,477759,480479,terrible things have happened
DduGAca6hZU,480479,482800,but i know that whatever i need you to
DduGAca6hZU,482800,484160,do
DduGAca6hZU,484160,485840,you are capable
DduGAca6hZU,485840,487280,however in the cut version of this
DduGAca6hZU,487280,488960,monologue we actually get a bit more
DduGAca6hZU,488960,491680,detail on her motivations you have so
DduGAca6hZU,491680,493919,much potential
DduGAca6hZU,493919,496160,i know you came to find the ones who had
DduGAca6hZU,496160,499199,disappeared all those years ago
DduGAca6hZU,499199,501039,but they're gone
DduGAca6hZU,501039,504960,they've been gone for a long time
DduGAca6hZU,504960,507599,terrible things have happened
DduGAca6hZU,507599,509759,and i am the cause
DduGAca6hZU,509759,512719,being able to exist as a doll
DduGAca6hZU,512719,515518,it has killed so many people now
DduGAca6hZU,515518,516959,interpreting cut content is always going
DduGAca6hZU,516959,518800,to be a tricky science do you use it do
DduGAca6hZU,518800,521200,you not how do you use it here i'm only
DduGAca6hZU,521200,522560,pointing it out because this seems to
DduGAca6hZU,522560,524320,confirm one of our original theories
DduGAca6hZU,524320,526720,that poppy is the reason all of this is
DduGAca6hZU,526720,528720,happening she literally says that
DduGAca6hZU,528720,530720,because she was able to exist as a doll
DduGAca6hZU,530720,533279,people died which tells us two things
DduGAca6hZU,533279,534800,one that she's been around since the
DduGAca6hZU,534800,536560,very beginning she knows about the
DduGAca6hZU,536560,538000,experimentation that's being done on
DduGAca6hZU,538000,540590,humans she's witnessed it all
DduGAca6hZU,540590,543859,[Music]
DduGAca6hZU,545120,548000,yes yes we hear you you're very special
DduGAca6hZU,548000,549600,you did it first secondly though it
DduGAca6hZU,549600,551680,seems to tell us that poppy isn't who we
DduGAca6hZU,551680,553600,originally thought loyal theorists will
DduGAca6hZU,553600,554880,remember that last time we predicted
DduGAca6hZU,554880,556880,that former employee stella graber was
DduGAca6hZU,556880,558480,the person whose body and spirit were
DduGAca6hZU,558480,560320,used to build poppy in chapter one we
DduGAca6hZU,560320,561839,found a vhs tape talking about her
DduGAca6hZU,561839,563440,desire to stay young and her love of
DduGAca6hZU,563440,565279,children which all but seem to scream
DduGAca6hZU,565279,567680,make me into an undying doll monster
DduGAca6hZU,567680,569200,however after the clue seeded out in
DduGAca6hZU,569200,571120,this chapter we know for a fact that she
DduGAca6hZU,571120,573279,is no longer a candidate when we first
DduGAca6hZU,573279,574800,enter the game station we're greeted by
DduGAca6hZU,574800,577920,stella's voice hi kids welcome to the
DduGAca6hZU,577920,581040,game station i'm stella and we've got
DduGAca6hZU,581040,583760,three super duper fun games to play her
DduGAca6hZU,583760,585279,name also appears on the bottom of a
DduGAca6hZU,585279,587120,document outlining how to test children
DduGAca6hZU,587120,589040,using the various game station modules
DduGAca6hZU,589040,591040,quote give all reports to ms stella
DduGAca6hZU,591040,593360,graber to sort through so stella was
DduGAca6hZU,593360,594720,clearly involved with whatever
DduGAca6hZU,594720,596560,experimentation was going on at playtime
DduGAca6hZU,596560,598320,co and since these experiments were
DduGAca6hZU,598320,599920,started because the living doll poppy
DduGAca6hZU,599920,602160,existed in the first place stella can't
DduGAca6hZU,602160,604480,be poppy in that same document we also
DduGAca6hZU,604480,606720,see references to mommy longlegs now if
DduGAca6hZU,606720,608399,you look closely at the mommy longlegs
DduGAca6hZU,608399,609760,commercial that plays at the top of the
DduGAca6hZU,609760,612959,chapter you can see that it's dated 1991
DduGAca6hZU,612959,614880,hoppy was meant to be the first living
DduGAca6hZU,614880,618160,toy developed back in 1950. therefore if
DduGAca6hZU,618160,619680,stella was alive around the time of
DduGAca6hZU,619680,621360,mommy longlegs then she couldn't
DduGAca6hZU,621360,624320,possibly be inside poppy so if poppy
DduGAca6hZU,624320,626560,isn't stella then who is she well early
DduGAca6hZU,626560,628320,in chapter 2 we visit elliott ludwig's
DduGAca6hZU,628320,630160,office founder of playtime co it's here
DduGAca6hZU,630160,631440,that we learned that he experienced a
DduGAca6hZU,631440,633920,tragic family loss sometime in the 1960s
DduGAca6hZU,633920,636959,in the 1960s an unfortunate family death
DduGAca6hZU,636959,639279,had pushed ludwig down to his lowest
DduGAca6hZU,639279,641120,this loss is what spurred him to work
DduGAca6hZU,641120,642800,harder and build an empire around his
DduGAca6hZU,642800,644959,toys now it's not actually clear who
DduGAca6hZU,644959,646800,this family member was he would suspect
DduGAca6hZU,646800,649120,his kid right kid dies or is dying and
DduGAca6hZU,649120,650640,he finds a way to make her into a living
DduGAca6hZU,650640,652000,toy
DduGAca6hZU,652000,653680,yeah yeah i am broke and i will put you
DduGAca6hZU,653680,655600,back together thank you fnaf go and do
DduGAca6hZU,655600,657440,something else with your life make your
DduGAca6hZU,657440,659760,lore more sensible stop trying to butt
DduGAca6hZU,659760,661440,into other people's narratives okay
DduGAca6hZU,661440,666079,other people's very similar narratives
DduGAca6hZU,666880,668480,anyway as i was saying you would suspect
DduGAca6hZU,668480,669920,that he's doing this for his kid right
DduGAca6hZU,669920,671440,and that's who poppy is it's his
DduGAca6hZU,671440,673279,daughter but there's a wrinkle to that
DduGAca6hZU,673279,674800,and it's not coming from the game but
DduGAca6hZU,674800,676880,rather the game's website you see we
DduGAca6hZU,676880,678959,know via newspaper article hidden on the
DduGAca6hZU,678959,680800,about section of playtime company's
DduGAca6hZU,680800,683040,merch website that eliot's wife divorced
DduGAca6hZU,683040,685839,him in 1930. this means that if a child
DduGAca6hZU,685839,687200,came from that relationship that
DduGAca6hZU,687200,688720,biological son or daughter would have
DduGAca6hZU,688720,691600,been in their 20s or 30s when poppy was
DduGAca6hZU,691600,694160,created it seems a bit old to be honest
DduGAca6hZU,694160,695920,the loss could have been a grandchild
DduGAca6hZU,695920,697360,that's definitely a possibility but for
DduGAca6hZU,697360,699279,me i think the most likely option was
DduGAca6hZU,699279,701120,that it was an adopted daughter in
DduGAca6hZU,701120,702959,chapter one we see a lot of posters
DduGAca6hZU,702959,704079,hanging on the walls talking about
DduGAca6hZU,704079,706399,playtime co's adoption initiative what
DduGAca6hZU,706399,708000,if that program was initially started
DduGAca6hZU,708000,709839,because elliott had an adopted child
DduGAca6hZU,709839,711440,himself and he wanted to bring that joy
DduGAca6hZU,711440,713600,to other families thereby modeling it in
DduGAca6hZU,713600,715680,those playtime company values and then
DduGAca6hZU,715680,717519,when his daughter dies or is suffering
DduGAca6hZU,717519,719839,he you know has to find a way to put her
DduGAca6hZU,719839,722320,back together so his adopted child dies
DduGAca6hZU,722320,723839,tragically and he tries something to
DduGAca6hZU,723839,725760,revive her probably by fusing her with
DduGAca6hZU,725760,727920,poppy and it works something he does
DduGAca6hZU,727920,730240,works she's in the doll but he's not
DduGAca6hZU,730240,732399,exactly sure what he did might i suggest
DduGAca6hZU,732399,734959,trying remnant or agony sorry sorry now
DduGAca6hZU,734959,736160,i'm just going out of my way to do it
DduGAca6hZU,736160,737920,anyway we know that he's unsure based on
DduGAca6hZU,737920,739680,a note that we find in elliot's office
DduGAca6hZU,739680,741200,in chapter 2. this note talks about
DduGAca6hZU,741200,743360,experiment 814 in which they try to
DduGAca6hZU,743360,745519,bring rats back to life using the poppy
DduGAca6hZU,745519,747360,flower my suspicion is that this is
DduGAca6hZU,747360,748959,because he was somehow able to revive
DduGAca6hZU,748959,751120,his daughter inside of poppy a doll who
DduGAca6hZU,751120,753279,we're told has the essence of poppy
DduGAca6hZU,753279,755279,flower built into her hair this is also
DduGAca6hZU,755279,756880,why we find poppy hidden in the glass
DduGAca6hZU,756880,758240,case it's so his daughter can be
DduGAca6hZU,758240,760639,preserved protected and also studied
DduGAca6hZU,760639,762399,it's because he saw it was possible and
DduGAca6hZU,762399,764000,then he went on to repeat it which is
DduGAca6hZU,764000,765440,why he's so happy about his wonderful
DduGAca6hZU,765440,768160,experiment 1006 the prototype after
DduGAca6hZU,768160,770720,nearly 200 additional experiments post
DduGAca6hZU,770720,772880,poppy flowers and rats this is where he
DduGAca6hZU,772880,774800,finally cracks the code he's brought
DduGAca6hZU,774800,776880,things to life but the prototype is too
DduGAca6hZU,776880,779279,smart it escapes and doesn't obey orders
DduGAca6hZU,779279,782000,sending the factory into chaos this is
DduGAca6hZU,782000,784160,why we hear that huggy wuggy is actually
DduGAca6hZU,784160,786320,the perfect creation because he's smart
DduGAca6hZU,786320,789040,but he's also obedient experiment one
DduGAca6hZU,789040,792079,one seven zero huggy wuggy remains the
DduGAca6hZU,792079,793920,optimal outcome due to his sufficient
DduGAca6hZU,793920,796079,intelligence paired with maximum
DduGAca6hZU,796079,798320,obedience and that my friends is the
DduGAca6hZU,798320,800720,story of how everything started at
DduGAca6hZU,800720,802800,playtime co we now know that elliot
DduGAca6hZU,802800,804480,ludwig's adopted daughter is likely the
DduGAca6hZU,804480,806160,entity inside the poppy doll and that
DduGAca6hZU,806160,807920,our overarching villain for the series
DduGAca6hZU,807920,809920,is the prototype the first successful
DduGAca6hZU,809920,812399,recreation of that technology of
DduGAca6hZU,812399,814480,bringing something back to life a toy
DduGAca6hZU,814480,816399,that steals and uses the pieces and
DduGAca6hZU,816399,818000,parts of other things to make itself
DduGAca6hZU,818000,820399,stronger but there's still lots more to
DduGAca6hZU,820399,823040,discover here who or what is inside the
DduGAca6hZU,823040,824880,other toys are they employees or are
DduGAca6hZU,824880,826000,they something else what about the
DduGAca6hZU,826000,827680,mysterious death screens that we see
DduGAca6hZU,827680,829600,each time we die what are they trying to
DduGAca6hZU,829600,832160,tell us if people are inside of toys
DduGAca6hZU,832160,833600,then what about the prototype is it
DduGAca6hZU,833600,835360,someone important or is it just a random
DduGAca6hZU,835360,836720,collection of people and probably the
DduGAca6hZU,836720,838800,biggest question of all who are we in
DduGAca6hZU,838800,840800,relation to all of this i suspect that i
DduGAca6hZU,840800,842000,may have figured out our character's
DduGAca6hZU,842000,843519,name and possible role in the company
DduGAca6hZU,843519,845600,but answers to that and more we'll have
DduGAca6hZU,845600,846959,to wait for next time just because i
DduGAca6hZU,846959,848240,have a few other things that i want to
DduGAca6hZU,848240,850000,double check inside the game first so
DduGAca6hZU,850000,851920,make sure you grab pack that subscribe
DduGAca6hZU,851920,853279,button to guarantee that you see our
DduGAca6hZU,853279,855199,second part of chapter 2's coverage when
DduGAca6hZU,855199,856880,it comes out here in a week or two and
DduGAca6hZU,856880,860639,until then remember it's all just a few
