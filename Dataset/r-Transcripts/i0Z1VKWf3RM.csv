i0Z1VKWf3RM,37643,39541,A 90 METER DROP
i0Z1VKWf3RM,42873,43903,There is no barrier.

i0Z1VKWf3RM,55518,56518,Copy.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,56604,58328,"Remember, you've got to get up to that spillway"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,58414,59822,before the water starts to fill up.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,59908,62226,The pressure is going to get stronger every passing minute.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,62312,63397,It's already begun.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,64146,65146,Okay.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,69761,71964,"I mean, where do I start?"

i0Z1VKWf3RM,73968,76745,This power plant is the single largest one in Iceland.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,76937,79493,"To drive the car in the water up the spillway,"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,79579,81665,It will be a huge challenge for you.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,82224,85243,This has only one final ending if something goes wrong.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,85329,88266,"The vehicle would fall off the spillway, and drop down 90 meters."
i0Z1VKWf3RM,88352,91007,And then there would probably be no more Jess.

i0Z1VKWf3RM,92429,95432,"This is crazy, to the point where we don't even know if it's possible."
i0Z1VKWf3RM,100106,101106,Are you ready?
i0Z1VKWf3RM,103036,104177,"Okay, good luck."
i0Z1VKWf3RM,105353,107761,That tunnel is going to be impassable in ten minutes.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,107848,108848,Got you.

i0Z1VKWf3RM,117155,120452,"When the water  starts to run over the barrier,"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,120539,125211,We have just an hour before it reaches 200 cubic meters a second.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,125836,126882,It isn't safe at all.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,149778,153544,Stories about the river monster go back as far as 1345.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,153630,156770,I've witnessed it myself.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,157070,160966,It moves in the water like a giant snake.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,161305,164911,Icelanders don't like to talk about it.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,165888,170286,There are also many ghosts here.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,180119,182299,How the [radio crackle] did they they found this place?
i0Z1VKWf3RM,186791,188330,I made it through.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,195412,197377,"Hard right, hard right now! Into the tunnel."
i0Z1VKWf3RM,197463,199744,They're really steep. It's all uphill from here.

i0Z1VKWf3RM,203252,205252,"Jess, we can't hear you. Can you hear me? [Muffled]"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,228140,229140,Wow.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,229226,231023,Found her again. She's out of the tunnel.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,231445,232915,You still want her to go up there?!
i0Z1VKWf3RM,233001,235266,She has to. The water is really coming down now.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,242356,243476,Keep on going.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,243562,244562,Copy.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,245570,246570,Steady...
i0Z1VKWf3RM,271042,273391,"Okay, that is steep."

i0Z1VKWf3RM,279909,282207,"It's really slippery, be really careful here."
i0Z1VKWf3RM,283429,285357,That is a LOT of water.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,302904,306459,The mind carries you half the way.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,307385,310005,I think it's possible.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,311167,312646,"We have to go, right away!"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,313503,314831,The water's getting heavier.

i0Z1VKWf3RM,324846,326002,There's no visibility!
i0Z1VKWf3RM,336409,338119,The camera is gone. We've lost the camera.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,347931,349235,"Go, go, go, go!"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,350250,352720,"Yeah, come on! Woo!"
i0Z1VKWf3RM,353500,354563,Smashed it.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,354781,355804,Phew.
i0Z1VKWf3RM,356928,358662,"Unbelievable, we did it!"
