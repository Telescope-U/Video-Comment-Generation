koYib7-6b7w,210,5990,"- In this video, we're gonna go through  how you create a vlog from start to finish."
koYib7-6b7w,5990,12240,"This is a special video that I'm putting together for you,  because I'm taking you through the entire process,"
koYib7-6b7w,12240,20260,"rather than just giving you some tips and tricks.  We're gonna go from idea creation,  to planning to the gear, how I shot,"
koYib7-6b7w,20260,26440,"and then we're gonna get into the edit  and I'll show you step by step,  how I develop my edit it's so that the footage"
koYib7-6b7w,26440,33380,"turns into a story that's entertaining to watch.  Now, recently I started a second channel.  That's all gonna be story-driven content,"
koYib7-6b7w,33380,39210,none of this tutorial stuff that you see here.  And I think that's a great way for me to show a different
koYib7-6b7w,39210,45160,side of what I create.  And those videos are a great example  of that different concepts that I teach here on my channel.
koYib7-6b7w,45160,50860,"So the video that we're gonna go through is a vlog  that I shot recently about my trip up to Butler Peak,"
koYib7-6b7w,50860,56500,"which is a fire lookout way out in the mountains.  Now it's not the best vlog that I've ever shot,"
koYib7-6b7w,56500,63000,but that's not what matters.  It's a video that really uses storytelling techniques  to help drive the video.
koYib7-6b7w,63000,71030,"Now, one of the big pitfalls  when it comes to creating YouTube content  is this idea of get over the fear and just hit record,"
koYib7-6b7w,71030,77360,which is great.  But the issue is if you don't have a plan in place  and you don't have an idea of where your video
koYib7-6b7w,77360,83650,"is gonna go, then a lot of times your video  is gonna fall flat.  No, one's gonna watch your video.  I see this all the time in my comments,"
koYib7-6b7w,83650,88897,"especially in my original, how to vlog video.  What I see a lot of the times are people saying like,"
koYib7-6b7w,88897,94157,"""I've been doing this for two years  ""and I've gotten no views.""  Or they're on the other side of the fence  where they just started their vlog."
koYib7-6b7w,94157,99670,"And they're like, alright, great.  I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna start shooting.  Now having motivation and being able to get over your fear"
koYib7-6b7w,99670,104810,"and just hitting record and just going for it,  is a great way to approach YouTube."
koYib7-6b7w,104810,111370,"But unless you've sat down  and really thought through your videos,  a lot of times just hitting record and recording everything,"
koYib7-6b7w,111370,116700,"and then trying to edit it into a video doesn't work.  You'll keep hearing this again and again,"
koYib7-6b7w,116700,122680,"the more you watch like YouTube education  and filmmaking tutorials,  you'll hear people say story matters most."
koYib7-6b7w,122680,129429,"Well that's great, but you need to understand  how to craft a story.  So in this video, storytelling is gonna be one aspect"
koYib7-6b7w,129429,136810,"that we're gonna cover.  And I'm gonna show you how I created a simple story  out of a vlog,  because if you can tie story into the vlogs"
koYib7-6b7w,136810,144720,"that you're creating,  it's gonna become more engaging for your audience.  If you have a setup, you have a history, you have a journey"
koYib7-6b7w,144720,150240,"and then there is a climax with a resolution.  When you put all those pieces into a YouTube video,"
koYib7-6b7w,150240,155580,your audience is going to be more into the video.  And then they're gonna wanna watch another one videos.
koYib7-6b7w,155580,161780,This is why some creators do so well.  You don't think about the storytelling elements  because it's just super engaging
koYib7-6b7w,161780,169810,"and you wanna keep watching.  But if you take a step back  and you look at these big creators,  you'll notice that these same storytelling elements"
koYib7-6b7w,169810,175830,"go across every video on their channels.  Look at someone like ""CaseyNeistat"",  or you look at ""Yes Theory""."
koYib7-6b7w,175830,181030,"They are using storytelling elements to craft their videos,  and if you take a step back"
koYib7-6b7w,181030,188020,"and look at every one of their videos,  you can look at the structure and understand that,  oh, that's their hook, or that's their setup,"
koYib7-6b7w,188020,193830,"or that's the buildup to the climax.  And that's the resolution like these components.  They seem very easy,"
koYib7-6b7w,193830,201900,"especially if someone's just saying here's storytelling,  ABCD it seems easy to do,  but to put that in practice is actually much harder."
koYib7-6b7w,201900,208890,"And it's a skill that you have to learn.  It's something you have to practice over and over and over.  And part of the reason I started my second channel,"
koYib7-6b7w,208890,214090,is to have a place where I can create  more story-driven content and not just do tutorials.
koYib7-6b7w,214090,219160,"Like these are great, I love helping you guys,  I love creating tutorials,  but I originally got into filmmaking"
koYib7-6b7w,219160,225290,"and creating YouTube videos  because I wanted to just create and tell stories.  Now, if you're always teaching"
koYib7-6b7w,225290,231010,"and you're never telling stories,  then you start to lose that skill of telling stories.  And before I got into YouTube,"
koYib7-6b7w,231010,236960,I was a documentary filmmaker.  I did a lot of reality TV.  And so there was a lot of story that I was working.
koYib7-6b7w,236960,242490,I would work with producers  and we'd be trying to craft the story  as we're dealing with real situations.
koYib7-6b7w,242490,249439,And that's essentially what you're doing.  And you need to craft a story around  these different elements that you're filming  so that they're engaging for a viewer to watch it.
koYib7-6b7w,249440,254830,"And there's something that someone's gonna stick around,  hit subscribe, hit, like watch your entire video,"
koYib7-6b7w,254830,261810,"and watch more videos.  'Cause that's, what's most important on YouTube.  If you can master that element, get people to watch longer,"
koYib7-6b7w,261810,267520,"watch more videos, then you'll find success.  And all of us are on here on YouTube  because we wanna grow following,"
koYib7-6b7w,267520,274210,"and we wanna build this into a sustainable business.  That is something that we can do full time  and be able to keep creating and enjoy creating,"
koYib7-6b7w,274210,279840,"because creating is fun.  And once you've learned your skills  and you know where you're going with your channel,"
koYib7-6b7w,279840,285940,"being able to create and make money from it,  it's an awesome career.  And there's also a lot of really positive things"
koYib7-6b7w,285940,291950,that you can do with video.  You can really tell some stories that will make an impact  in the world.  And there's just so many different ways
koYib7-6b7w,291950,299670,"that you can approach YouTube  so that you can make an impact.  So I know that was a huge long intro, but in this video,"
koYib7-6b7w,299670,306569,what we're gonna go into is how you've vlog  from start to finish.  And we're gonna go through every step of the process.
koYib7-6b7w,306570,311630,"You're gonna come alongside me,  and we're gonna make a vlog together.  All right, guys, let's get into."
koYib7-6b7w,311630,314213,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,316850,322200,"Step one, of the process is the idea of phase.  Now, before we get into the idea phase,"
koYib7-6b7w,322200,329310,"I just wanna ask you guys, you know,  this is around story-driven vlog content.  If you're interested in seeing a breakdown like this,"
koYib7-6b7w,329310,336569,"for say a tutorial or a review,  I would love to hear from you guys.  So go down the comments  and just tell me what style of videos you'd like to see"
koYib7-6b7w,336570,344039,"an entire breakdown of.  Let's get into the idea phase.  So before you even go out and start shooting,"
koYib7-6b7w,344040,350150,you really need to come up with the concept  of what it is that you're going to go shoot.  When I started the process of wanting to create
koYib7-6b7w,350150,356150,"this Butler Peak vlog,  I didn't just pick up my camera and go out to this trail  and start shooting."
koYib7-6b7w,356150,361469,"If I started in that,  I would have no idea where this video was gonna go.  And I think that's key,"
koYib7-6b7w,361470,367030,"obviously there's that element of surprise  when you're creating content,  but you wanna have a trajectory."
koYib7-6b7w,367030,372970,"You wanna have a goal of what you're planning to do,  in your video.  And when I first started this channel,"
koYib7-6b7w,372970,379539,"if you go way back in the history, it's like 500 videos ago.  I did a lot of vlogs and a lot of times I would hit record"
koYib7-6b7w,379540,385430,"and just start shooting and then just see where it goes,  and then cut all that together.  And those videos, weren't that entertaining."
koYib7-6b7w,385430,391110,"I mean, yeah, if you wanna come along for the journey  and you just wanna like, see my day like that,"
koYib7-6b7w,391110,398139,"some people watched it.  A lot of my family, my grandma loves those,  but like, that's not gonna build you a bigger audience."
koYib7-6b7w,398140,403400,You wanna approach your video with a goal in mind.  So when I started coming up with concepts
koYib7-6b7w,403400,409880,"for my second channel,  my goal with that channel  is to tell stories from adventures.  That's kind of where I'm positioning that channel."
koYib7-6b7w,409880,416850,"Obviously it's a new channel and just playing around.  But this video specifically,  I wanted to find somewhere that I could hide too."
koYib7-6b7w,416850,424156,"That would be unique and have this ending,  like have something at the end that makes worth the journey."
koYib7-6b7w,424157,426740,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,430480,436810,"Like, I didn't want to just go down a random hiking trail  and then get to the end and be like, great.  We finished the hiking trail, that was fun."
koYib7-6b7w,436810,442900,"I enjoyed a hike.  That's not an interesting story for a viewer.  There has to be an obstacle.  There has, to be not only obstacles,"
koYib7-6b7w,442900,449639,but there has to be somewhere that we're going.  So I started doing research just online.  I started looking up the little area
koYib7-6b7w,449640,456090,"that I was gonna go shoot this video, which is Big Bear.  So I started typing in, you know, Big Bear hiking spots."
koYib7-6b7w,456090,461520,"Now, from there, I started just reading a ton of blogs,  looking for different and unique places"
koYib7-6b7w,461520,468170,"that might be interesting to film.  Obviously, when you start typing in things  like Big Bear hiking,  you're gonna find a ton of trails"
koYib7-6b7w,468170,474730,"and there's gonna be a lot of different places to go.  So as I started doing this research,  there's a few things that started popping up,"
koYib7-6b7w,474730,481590,"and I saw this Butler Peak lookout pop up I was like,  that looks like a great spot.  I went on YouTube, I started doing some research"
koYib7-6b7w,481590,487030,"and I found videos of people,  driving their Jeep up to the Butler Peak.  While right there, I'm like, well,"
koYib7-6b7w,487030,493080,"that's not that interesting  because if that's super easily accessible,  that might not be a video that I wanna go after."
koYib7-6b7w,493080,499640,"These were all older videos that I was seeing.  And then I noticed that there was an article recently,  that showed that the road had been closed"
koYib7-6b7w,499640,506750,"because of winter damage.  All right, That becomes more of an interesting story.  I have this goal to get to it's this longest trail,"
koYib7-6b7w,506750,511910,"it's all up hill.  So there's some challenge there,  and there's the roads washed out."
koYib7-6b7w,511910,517340,"So this might be an interesting story to go after,  because there are some things in place"
koYib7-6b7w,517340,523329,"that make it so that I can tell a story about the journey  from beginning to end.  Now, this is where research is super important."
koYib7-6b7w,523330,532100,"I spent a couple hours just reading articles  and blogs about this hike,  trying to figure out best routes, what to expect."
koYib7-6b7w,532100,539210,"And also just current conditions  and the history behind the Butler peak fire lookout,  because all of that is gonna come into play"
koYib7-6b7w,539210,544819,"when you're actually shooting the vlog.  Now you might think that's crazy.  You're spending all this time, just coming up with an idea,"
koYib7-6b7w,544820,552150,"but that's important when it comes to creating videos  that people actually wanna watch.  You need to spend time on the idea and creation phase,"
koYib7-6b7w,552150,558270,"and you might waste 1/2 a day  trying to find a good story to tell,  but once you can find a good story to tell"
koYib7-6b7w,558270,564990,"something that people might be interested in,  it's gonna set you apart from the people  who are just hitting record and shooting their day."
koYib7-6b7w,564990,571000,Like that's the biggest thing here.  We're trying to create interest.  We're trying to create stories  that people will want to watch.
koYib7-6b7w,571000,576390,"And then they'll want to watch more videos from now.  Step two, in the process of creating a vlog is planning."
koYib7-6b7w,576390,584520,"Now I did a whole video around script writing  and outlining process, and I'll link to that description,  but let's go through my process for this video specifically."
koYib7-6b7w,584520,590070,So let's go over to the whiteboard real quick.  And let me just walk you through a basic story structure.
koYib7-6b7w,590070,596540,"So a story is made up of a series of events.  The first thing is your hook,  and we're talking specifically YouTube here,"
koYib7-6b7w,596540,601610,because we wanna get people interested in your video  and then stay to the end and then watch another video.
koYib7-6b7w,601610,607360,"So you wanna start with the hook first 10 to 15 seconds,  this is something exciting that you either pull from,"
koYib7-6b7w,607360,614090,"that what happens in the vlog  or it's something that you plan out,  so that it gets people hooked into your video."
koYib7-6b7w,614090,619410,"So for my video, I use this opening drone shot,  which gives you people an idea of what's coming"
koYib7-6b7w,619410,625700,"in the climax of this video.  So your first act is basically setting up,  what's gonna happen in this vlog."
koYib7-6b7w,625700,631209,"So in this first act, you wanna set up problem  or your conflict,  and you also wanna give some back story."
koYib7-6b7w,631210,637910,"And this is basically,  what happens before you start your journey.  So for my video, I set up that I'm trying to get"
koYib7-6b7w,639169,644760,to the peak of this mountain at this fire lookout.  And I also set up in this first act behind the fire lookout
koYib7-6b7w,644760,653220,"and just fire lookout in general.  Now in storytelling, there's,  what's called an inciting incident  and this is what sends the character on the journey."
koYib7-6b7w,653220,659269,"So if there's something specific  that sends you on the journey of this vlog,  this is where you add it in."
koYib7-6b7w,659270,664430,"Now, the second act of your story is your journey.  And this is where you have a series of events"
koYib7-6b7w,664430,669930,that either take you closer to your objective  or different challenges that you face along the journey.
koYib7-6b7w,669930,675120,So the idea is that you have different obstacles  in your way.  So this is all the exciting part of the vlog.
koYib7-6b7w,675120,682183,"This is the meat of the vlog,  this is the you doing, the thing that you set out to do.  So for me, in the context of this video,"
koYib7-6b7w,682183,688930,"it's the challenge of the mountain.  It's the challenge of being in the direct sunlight,  the conflict that comes with road, that's washed out"
koYib7-6b7w,688930,694949,"like all these different elements that help drive  the story forward,  but also make it harder for me to get to my goal."
koYib7-6b7w,694950,701009,Now that your third act is gonna be your climax  and your resolution.  That's where your story reaches crucial moment.
koYib7-6b7w,701010,708410,You finally get to the place or the thing finally happens  that you set out to do.  So for this it's that moment when I get up to the fire hut
koYib7-6b7w,708410,714360,"and I'm almost there,  that is the climax, that's the peak.  And then the resolution is what happens"
koYib7-6b7w,714360,720620,"once I actually reach that moment.  So a basic diagram of how your story should be structured  for a vlog is you have your hook,"
koYib7-6b7w,720620,726769,"you grab your audience attention, you have your opening,  exposition, your history, your conflict,"
koYib7-6b7w,726770,733060,"that's your first act.  Then you have your second act,  which has all the obstacles and different things  that come along on the journey."
koYib7-6b7w,733060,738800,"You have your climax, which is the peak.  You finally get to that thing that you're set out to do,  at the very beginning."
koYib7-6b7w,738800,744290,"And then you have your resolution,  you tie everything up.  And then for YouTube,  you add this last little bit that gets people"
koYib7-6b7w,744290,751520,"to go watch another video.  So you try to give your viewers something at the end  that makes them watch the next video in your series,"
koYib7-6b7w,751520,757620,"or the next video on your channel.  Okay, so the challenge or the conflict of the story is,"
koYib7-6b7w,757620,763620,"will I get to the summit and what will I find at the summit?  That is what I set up right at the beginning of the video,"
koYib7-6b7w,763620,769000,it gives you that starting point of where this video  is going and why you should be interested and engaged.
koYib7-6b7w,769000,775730,"So beyond just setting up this conflict,  I also need to set up the history.  So a little bit of information about the Butler Peak"
koYib7-6b7w,775730,782067,"specifically, and also just fire lookouts in general.  That gives you the viewer, the context of what my goal is,"
koYib7-6b7w,782067,787400,"add some history behind the trail  and just fire lookouts in general.  Now, from that point to the climax,"
koYib7-6b7w,787400,795379,you got to build story beats.  One of the story beats that I was thinking through  was the journey from my house to the trailhead.
koYib7-6b7w,795380,800519,"That's gonna be one story beat.  And then the trail itself needs to be a story beat,"
koYib7-6b7w,800520,807810,"you know, different conflicts that I may encounter.  And this is kind of loose  because when you're creating a vlog,  it's kind of like documentary or reality in a way"
koYib7-6b7w,807810,813980,"where you're not gonna plan out every little thing.  Now, some people might have more structured vlogs where yes,"
koYib7-6b7w,813980,819180,you can plan out every aspect of your video  in terms of doing a video where it's more reality-based
koYib7-6b7w,819180,825140,"where you're experiencing something,  you're gonna have these rough outlines of things that,  you wanna capture."
koYib7-6b7w,825140,833050,"And as you shoot the video,  it's going to evolve and change like theirs.  That's just the nature of creating reality style content."
koYib7-6b7w,833050,841040,So the next story beat is the journey up.  So actually mountain biking up the path.  And I changed it from hiking to mountain biking
koYib7-6b7w,841040,846970,"after doing my research.  Originally, I was gonna hike this trail,  but I thought it was gonna be more interesting  to mountain biking personally,"
koYib7-6b7w,846970,852589,I just wanted to mountain bike it anyways.  And it also saves me time because I'm gonna be shooting
koYib7-6b7w,852590,858660,"a lot while I'm up there,  and on a mountain bike it's a little bit quicker,  especially on the way down.  So the next story beat that I wanna cover"
koYib7-6b7w,858660,864730,"is actually approaching the fire lookout.  And the climax of the story  is when I get to the fire lookout,"
koYib7-6b7w,864730,869829,and then the resolution  is actually finally getting to the top  and finding what's there.
koYib7-6b7w,869830,875610,So this is my plan.  And what I did was I put it in my phone.  I just have it in my notepad.
koYib7-6b7w,875610,881870,"That's what I use to create all my videos.  And I wrote down these different story beats,  just so I was reminded of what I'm doing."
koYib7-6b7w,881870,887090,I also wrote down any notes about the trail itself.  Anything that I wanna remember to talk about
koYib7-6b7w,887090,892700,"so that I have it all in one place.  Now, when it comes to your creation process,  you've got find a system that works for you."
koYib7-6b7w,892700,899740,"For me on my iPhone, the notepad,  it's the easiest way for me to create videos  and just keep writing notes and add things."
koYib7-6b7w,899740,907210,"Because on your notepad,  you can not only create notes, but you can drop in photos,  you can drop in, different elements that you find"
koYib7-6b7w,907210,913440,"so that when you're actually planning, and scripting,  and coming up with the process,  you can put everything in one place."
koYib7-6b7w,913440,918710,"I've found for me that,  if I start trying to use different apps  and different pieces of software"
koYib7-6b7w,918710,923810,"to do all of this planning,  that I ended up getting lost in all of it,  and I don't use any of it."
koYib7-6b7w,923810,929810,"So my notepad and my whiteboard right here,  are my two best friends when it comes to planning  and creating videos."
koYib7-6b7w,929810,936077,"So now that I have a plan,  I just need to pick a day that I'm gonna go do this,  give myself the day to actually shoot"
koYib7-6b7w,936077,941740,"and the freedom to actually shoot and not be rushed,  and go shoot it, that's the next process."
koYib7-6b7w,941740,946890,Now we're gonna get into gear next.  I just wanna talk about this element of time
koYib7-6b7w,946890,952829,"because I have a five month old,  she's upstairs sleeping right now.  I'm shooting this video at 6:00 AM,"
koYib7-6b7w,952830,959280,"trying to get stuff done before,  she wakes up and wants to go play.  And that you gotta remember that,  life is more than just YouTube."
koYib7-6b7w,959280,964339,"Like there is more than just one priority of making videos.  Some of us, yeah, I mean,"
koYib7-6b7w,964340,970450,"if you are single and this is all you're doing right now,  take advantage of the fact that you can put more time"
koYib7-6b7w,970450,976130,"into creating videos.  The more time that you can dedicate to the process,  the faster you're gonna grow."
koYib7-6b7w,976130,981800,"And the more you're gonna find success.  Now, if you have a job, if you're a family,  you're just gonna have to set aside time"
koYib7-6b7w,981800,987769,to make this happen.  And this is also why planning scripting  is gonna be even more important
koYib7-6b7w,987770,993089,"because if you're shooting videos  that people aren't gonna wanna watch,  you're just spinning your wheels and wasting your time."
koYib7-6b7w,993090,1000100,"Whereas if you spend time and really focus in the content  that you're producing, then yeah,  the one day that you have to shoot your video,"
koYib7-6b7w,1000100,1006760,"your know that you're gonna shoot a video,  that people are actually interested  and that they wanna watch.  And you won't go five years down the road"
koYib7-6b7w,1006760,1014550,"without any growth on your channel  because you know that you're setting  yourself up for success.  So for me, I chose a day where I could go up to Big Bear,"
koYib7-6b7w,1014550,1020290,"shoot this video, my parents have a cabin up there.  So I was going to go for the entire day and spend the night"
koYib7-6b7w,1020290,1026480,"that gives me the flexibility to go create  and not having the pressure of time  of me needing to drive back home,"
koYib7-6b7w,1026480,1033209,"rushed back to do things.  Part of the process of creating YouTube videos  and creating vlogs is setting yourself up,"
koYib7-6b7w,1033209,1040329,"so that you can actually do the whole process.  So if you need to wake up early before your job  or before kids are up, then do that,"
koYib7-6b7w,1040329,1046240,"so that you can do the idea creation phase.  If you need to set aside a day to go shoot, do that."
koYib7-6b7w,1046240,1051650,"Because the more that you think through the process,  and you actually give yourself the proper time,"
koYib7-6b7w,1051650,1058660,"you need to make a video,  the easier it's gonna be for you.  And the more creative you can be.  And that's the key, we're in a creative endeavor."
koYib7-6b7w,1058660,1065240,"We are here to shoot videos that people  are gonna wanna watch, and you wanna be creative,  which is the fun aspect of creating videos."
koYib7-6b7w,1065240,1071870,"Now let's get into the next step of the process for me,  which is grabbing the gear that I to film.  So for this vlog specifically,"
koYib7-6b7w,1071870,1076900,"I used a bunch of different pieces of gear.  However, you need to just pick your camera system"
koYib7-6b7w,1076900,1082779,"and what lenses you're gonna bring.  If you're just using your phone, just use your phone.  That's sometimes that's the best tool"
koYib7-6b7w,1082780,1087810,"that you have is the phone in your pocket.  And in this video,  you'll see that I actually shot a bunch of segments"
koYib7-6b7w,1087810,1094960,"using my phone because I was riding my bike.  And I just wanted to get something quick,  could have used a GoPro, but I forgot a GoPro."
koYib7-6b7w,1094960,1101679,But the gear that I brought along was my camera.  I brought along a couple of prime lenses  because I wanted to get super shallow depth of fields.
koYib7-6b7w,1101680,1107480,"I wanna get that cinematic look, I brought along a drone.  I brought along a point and shoot the Sony ZV-1."
koYib7-6b7w,1107480,1113130,It's kind of overkill 'cause I was using my phone too.  But the Sony ZV-1 what I used at the beginning  of the video.
koYib7-6b7w,1113130,1119210,"And I ended up leaving it in the car  because I didn't wanna actually bring it on the trail,  but it was a good camera to grab some quick bits with."
koYib7-6b7w,1119210,1126210,"I brought indie filters for my lenses, because again,  I'm trying to get that cinematic look.  And some of the tools that I use for my gear"
koYib7-6b7w,1126210,1131900,"is Indie filters, prime lenses.  I brought along a gimbal  because I knew I wanted to get super smooth shots."
koYib7-6b7w,1131900,1137450,I didn't want shoot everything handheld.  I brought enough batteries and cards to last me the day.  And then I brought my computer
koYib7-6b7w,1137450,1142510,"because at night I wanted to review the footage  and make sure there wasn't anything that,  I needed to reshoot."
koYib7-6b7w,1142510,1148850,And that's something that might come up  when you're actually producing your content.  You might need to reshoot little elements.
koYib7-6b7w,1148850,1155980,"That's not a bad thing, but as you're crafting your story,  and when you're looking at your footage,  if you're in a situation where you can go out and reshoot"
koYib7-6b7w,1155980,1161269,"something, maybe you need to get a reaction from yourself,  or you need to set something up a little bit better,"
koYib7-6b7w,1161270,1167880,"go out and do that.  Even if you're not in the exact same location.  So for example,  if you were doing something in like a city environment"
koYib7-6b7w,1167880,1175260,"and you forgot to set up a scene properly,  then you could go find like an alleyway or a wall  or something that might look like it was in that scene"
koYib7-6b7w,1175260,1181610,"and go reshoot that setup and then tie it in,  and it will look seamless.  You can find something that has a similar background"
koYib7-6b7w,1181610,1186880,"to where you were shooting the original video.  So, because I was going to Big Bear,  which is a mountain town,"
koYib7-6b7w,1186880,1194100,it's a few hours away from where I live.  I needed to bring my computer so I could sit down  and go through all the footage  and kind of look at it before I drove back home.
koYib7-6b7w,1194100,1202679,"And the backpack that I use for all my gear  is my Shimoda X50 that holds all this gear.  Plus my mountain biking, gear, some water, a ton of food."
koYib7-6b7w,1202680,1208149,"Like you got to take care of yourself,  while you're out shooting.  And that's one reason why I personally use a Shimoda bag."
koYib7-6b7w,1208150,1214520,"It's 'cause it allows me to put a big water bottle  on the side.  One thing that, you know,  a lot of people don't talk about is the things that you need"
koYib7-6b7w,1214520,1221350,"outside the camera gear.  So when you're developing your kit  of what you wanna bring with you for your vlogs,  you got to think through like yourself,"
koYib7-6b7w,1221350,1227690,"like, what else do you need?  Food, water, maybe rain gear, hats,  like there's different things that you would bring with you,"
koYib7-6b7w,1227690,1233350,to do your adventures  or whatever it is that you're shooting.  And you have to make sure you bring that on top
koYib7-6b7w,1233350,1239980,"of your camera gear,  'cause you know, you don't wanna get stuck in a situation  where you don't have enough water.  On this trip, I brought two massive things with water"
koYib7-6b7w,1239980,1246310,"and it really weighed me down.  And weight is also something,  you're gonna have to take into consideration.  My backpack was heavy with all this gear."
koYib7-6b7w,1246310,1252740,"And sometimes I don't bring all of this.  This video specifically,  I knew I had more time to be able to shoot this."
koYib7-6b7w,1252740,1258570,"And I took a lot of breaks on the way up,  just because I was carrying a backpack that weighed a ton."
koYib7-6b7w,1258570,1264170,"So you have to think through realistically,  what can you bring with you,  when I'm doing more of an expedition?"
koYib7-6b7w,1264170,1270490,"So last year I went to Ecuador  and climb some of the tallest peaks down there.  I brought very little gear for that,"
koYib7-6b7w,1270490,1276920,"and focused mainly on lightweight gear because I was,  I needed more gear to protect me from the elements"
koYib7-6b7w,1276920,1283149,"when I'm at like 19,000 feet, that's insane.  And now that I have a second channel,  I can revisit all that footage."
koYib7-6b7w,1283150,1288610,'Cause I never actually produced anything from those videos.  And I think that's topic for another video on this channel.
koYib7-6b7w,1288610,1296260,And that is what happens when you don't have a story  because I shot two weeks of footage  and I didn't go through this planning and idea stage.
koYib7-6b7w,1296260,1301650,And I ended up with a bunch of footage  that doesn't tie together.  So now I have to come up with a way to put all this footage
koYib7-6b7w,1301650,1307530,"together and make a story out of it.  And that's something I'm trying to help you guys avoid,  with this video,  because personally I've done this,"
koYib7-6b7w,1307530,1313370,I've shot multiple weeks of footage.  I've gone out with like this Epic situation  and ended up falling flat
koYib7-6b7w,1313370,1319040,because I didn't get the key elements  that I needed to tell my story.  So I really want you guys to think through process.
koYib7-6b7w,1319040,1325540,"I want you to think through actually the idea  and preparation stage,  because that's gonna help you find success."
koYib7-6b7w,1325540,1331430,"And the more that you do this,  the more that you plan out videos  and create your story structure,  the easier it's gonna get,  and it'll become natural."
koYib7-6b7w,1331430,1337290,"At first, it might seem like a lot of work,  but after you do a few videos,  you'll start getting in a rhythm and you'll be like, yep,"
koYib7-6b7w,1337290,1343790,"I need a conflict. I need a resolution.  I need something that I'm going towards.  What is that?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, figure it out."
koYib7-6b7w,1343790,1349050,"And you know, you won't necessarily  need to spend so much time on the research phase  because you'll instinctually be able to set up"
koYib7-6b7w,1349050,1354070,"these story elements.  That's gonna help you craft a better, a better vlog.  All right, so let's get into shooting the video."
koYib7-6b7w,1354070,1359680,"Now this is where a lot of people start.  So you could see how much preparation that goes into,"
koYib7-6b7w,1359680,1365490,"before you even hit record.  Whenever you're shooting of vlog,  you really want to shoot more than,  you're actually gonna use it."
koYib7-6b7w,1365490,1371010,So one of the key things that I always suggest is to set up  everything that you do and do it on camera
koYib7-6b7w,1371010,1376320,"because you may or may not use, that as part of your video,  but having all those elements,"
koYib7-6b7w,1376320,1382670,"when it gets into the editing is gonna help you,  actually craft your story.  When I woke up that morning to shoot this video,"
koYib7-6b7w,1382670,1388410,6:00 AM I needed to get my gear together.  So I turned on a camera and shot just a few things
koYib7-6b7w,1388410,1394330,"as I was setting up my gear, right?  So the goal today is to go up to Big Bear,"
koYib7-6b7w,1394330,1400730,which there's this fight their lookout.  It's like up on top off of a mountain  it overlooks all of Big Bear.
koYib7-6b7w,1400730,1407490,"And she says, really cool structure.  Now I also grabbed a bunch of B roll,  and B roll is the footage"
koYib7-6b7w,1407490,1413919,"that's gonna help tire video together.  And you can use B roll in so many different ways,  whether it's on top of when you're talking,"
koYib7-6b7w,1413920,1419600,"or use it for transitions  with a little bit of music,  or add a voiceover, add some B roll,"
koYib7-6b7w,1419600,1425690,some music like you can tie B roll  in so many different ways.  And one of the things you wanna do is coverage.
koYib7-6b7w,1425690,1431890,"You wanna overshoot when it comes to B roll,  I'm always shocked because I shoot so much footage.  And then when I get to the editing phase,"
koYib7-6b7w,1431890,1437760,"I use almost every single shot  because the more coverage that you get,  the more flexibility you have to craft your story,"
koYib7-6b7w,1437760,1443160,"and you can do things like quicker cuts  to just like get little hits of things.  And when I shot this,  I didn't know if I was gonna use this."
koYib7-6b7w,1443160,1449850,"I didn't know if I was gonna start,  at the trailhead versus at home,  but it's good to grab these different elements."
koYib7-6b7w,1449850,1455919,"Now, as I drove to Big Bear,  I grabbed a bunch of footage of the drive,  whether it was out the side window,"
koYib7-6b7w,1455920,1463020,the front window perspective of my hand.  And I did this throughout the drive.  It was a two and a 1/2 hour drive to get to Big Bear.
koYib7-6b7w,1463020,1468950,"And as the light changed in different ways,  in the different roads that I went on,  I just grabbed some B roll shots."
koYib7-6b7w,1468950,1474450,"And I shot all this using the ZV-1.  Now when the road changed and there was no one on the road,  that's when I was like, okay,"
koYib7-6b7w,1474450,1480900,"this is a key element that I'm gonna probably use.  And so this shot right here,  I shot a super long shot of this road"
koYib7-6b7w,1480900,1486950,because I thought potentially this could be used  as a timelapse if I wanted to add that omen into it.
koYib7-6b7w,1486950,1492643,So one thing you should be thinking about is time change  in your videos.  Are there parts
koYib7-6b7w,1492643,1498530,"where you're gonna need to show a time shift?  Like you need to show time moving forward,  and timelapses are a great way to do that."
koYib7-6b7w,1498530,1504050,"So transition scenes  can be as quick as just a simple timeline.  You watch a lot of ""CaseyNeistat"" videos."
koYib7-6b7w,1504050,1509810,He always put his camera down and did a quick timelapse  'cause it's just a quick transition  that shows the passage of time.
koYib7-6b7w,1509810,1517050,"Now there's a whole section when I met up with my parents,  went to their house and I didn't film any of that,  because it didn't really think it was relevant to the story."
koYib7-6b7w,1517050,1523880,"The next beat that I wanted to capture,  'cause I was looking at my plan was the trailhead.  And so as I was approaching the trailhead,"
koYib7-6b7w,1523880,1530410,"I was on a dirt road.  I pulled out the camera and I started shooting  just me talking to camera again, setting up what's coming,"
koYib7-6b7w,1530410,1536299,"what to expect, what my challenges are,  need to think through everything that's coming"
koYib7-6b7w,1536300,1541660,and talk about those elements.  And you wanna try and do this in a way  where you're not always repeating the same information
koYib7-6b7w,1541660,1548320,"over and over.  So when I was at home, I said, one bit of information.  Now I don't wanna say that same exact thing,"
koYib7-6b7w,1548320,1555080,"when I'm in the car, you could repeat some stuff.  And there are times where yes,  I would suggest doing the same kind of information"
koYib7-6b7w,1555080,1562480,"over and over,  but you're only gonna use one in the edit  'cause you wanna keep the story moving forward.  So you always want to be thinking, what did I say last?"
koYib7-6b7w,1562480,1568730,"And what do I need to say next,  that's going to help keep moving this story forward,  getting me towards my goal."
koYib7-6b7w,1568730,1574220,And also what are some interesting things that are happening  right now that makes this moment unique
koYib7-6b7w,1574220,1579900,and why I'm capturing it.  So this was a great opportunity to talk about the trail  because I'm about to get to the trail.
koYib7-6b7w,1579900,1586540,"So some of the key things that I found in my research  was that the road got washed out,  that you have to park their car at the bottom"
koYib7-6b7w,1586540,1592090,"and you have to hike, the five, six miles  to get to the summit.  Any information that came up in research,"
koYib7-6b7w,1592090,1598139,"this was a great opportunity to talk about what to expect.  So originally you could, four-wheel  all the way to Butler Peak"
koYib7-6b7w,1598140,1603990,"and you can park down below it,  and be able to walk up to this fire hut.  And because the road got washed out a years ago,"
koYib7-6b7w,1603990,1612340,"they've shut it down.  So basically you have to park at the bottom,  and then get yourself up.  It's about a 10 to 12 mile hike."
koYib7-6b7w,1612340,1618379,"And I don't really know what to expect from this trail.  So as you're getting into a situation in your vlog,"
koYib7-6b7w,1618380,1623850,"you can always set it up by putting out there,  what you're expecting  and maybe what you're scared of,"
koYib7-6b7w,1623850,1629210,"or what you're worried about, or what you're excited for.  What are some emotions that you're feeling right now,"
koYib7-6b7w,1629210,1634950,"before you go into that situation?  Okay, so now that I'm at the trail, this is the fun part."
koYib7-6b7w,1634950,1641170,This is kind of the whole purpose of creating vlogs  is taking someone on a journey.  I didn't know what to expect.
koYib7-6b7w,1641170,1646900,"I didn't know what I was gonna encounter,  so as I started doing the trail,  I started shooting different elements"
koYib7-6b7w,1646900,1653880,"that were of interest to me.  So when you're in a situation like this,  where you don't know what to expect, and it's all new,"
koYib7-6b7w,1653880,1660520,just keep an eye out for things that might be interesting  that help tell your story.  This video is about getting to the fire lookout.
koYib7-6b7w,1660520,1667290,"So I need to find elements as I'm going up this trail  that talk about the trail itself, the conditions,"
koYib7-6b7w,1667290,1672580,"maybe what I'm feeling, maybe what I'm worried about.  If I got lost, if I'm not sure of things,"
koYib7-6b7w,1672580,1678090,is there any conflict that's coming up  as I'm going along on this journey?  That's the elements that I wanna capture
koYib7-6b7w,1678090,1684370,"'cause that's, those are the elements that are interesting.  And also because I'm doing a mountain biking video,  I wanna talk about, the trail."
koYib7-6b7w,1684370,1689830,"So part of what you wanna do,  when you're creating a story driven vlog  is think through your audience."
koYib7-6b7w,1689830,1695429,"So who is your audience?  What would they actually care about?  So for this style of video,  I was catering it towards people"
koYib7-6b7w,1695430,1701220,who are interested in outdoor style content.  So what are those audience members interested in?
koYib7-6b7w,1701220,1708070,"They're gonna be interested in,  conditions of the trail, what I was feeling like,  things that were going on at that moment."
koYib7-6b7w,1708070,1713660,They're not interested in the cameras that I'm using.  They're not interested in the drone and using my drone.
koYib7-6b7w,1713660,1718970,So I'm not gonna shoot video of me playing around  with my drone and almost crashing my drone.
koYib7-6b7w,1718970,1725020,Like my audience here on this channel  cares about making YouTube videos.  But my audience that I was catering this towards
koYib7-6b7w,1725020,1730820,was not necessarily people  who are interested in the creation process.  It was more people who wanna watch an adventure film
koYib7-6b7w,1730820,1737840,"or people who are interested in mountain biking  on this trail.  Kind of serves two purposes here,  'cause somebody who might be interested in this trail"
koYib7-6b7w,1737840,1744370,"will watch this video to get an experience of it,  because they might wanna go do it.  And also someone who's just interested in watching adventure"
koYib7-6b7w,1744370,1753120,style vlogs would be interested in watching this because  it's a vlog about an adventure.  So I'm not gonna stop and talk about my camera and my gimbal
koYib7-6b7w,1753120,1760400,"and different things that I was working with,  because they have no place in the story.  So you got to really think through of who your audience is,"
koYib7-6b7w,1760400,1766340,and avoid creating content that your audience  wouldn't be interested in.  So some of the things that I encountered on this trail
koYib7-6b7w,1766340,1772909,was the sun super hot beating down on me.  I encountered a lot of areas where it was washed out.
koYib7-6b7w,1772910,1779900,The Hill itself was steep and it was a long trek  all the way to the top.  So those are all conflicts that I wanted to capture
koYib7-6b7w,1779900,1785360,"and talk about now beyond just me talking to camera,  which I did just using my iPhone."
koYib7-6b7w,1785360,1791660,"I had a point like this, filming myself as I was writing.  It's more interesting because it's in the process."
koYib7-6b7w,1791660,1796780,"So beyond that, I shot a ton of B roll.  So I would stop at different sections along the trail"
koYib7-6b7w,1796780,1802340,and shoot different batches of B roll.  So first I stopped I just wanted to get the forest
koYib7-6b7w,1802340,1809170,"that I was going through.  So I really focused on just the elements of nature.  So getting some of these gimbal shots,"
koYib7-6b7w,1809170,1815140,"then the next time I stopped, it was at a washout.  So I got a few different elements here.  I got gimbal shots of the washout."
koYib7-6b7w,1815140,1821500,"I put the camera on a tripod.  I shot myself walking through the scene,  and then I got some detailed elements of my bike."
koYib7-6b7w,1821500,1827610,Now this is key.  You wanna shoot a variety of content.  You don't wanna just shoot the same thing over and over.
koYib7-6b7w,1827610,1833820,With your B roll you wanna be getting a ton of coverage.  So you wanna be getting different angles.  You wanna be getting different shot sizes.
koYib7-6b7w,1833820,1839259,You wanna be able to get reactions  as well as POV of what you're doing.
koYib7-6b7w,1839260,1845890,"So if you haven't seen my video  on how to shoot better B roll,  I go through this idea of shooting B roll."
koYib7-6b7w,1845890,1851210,"And that's a great followup video to this,  because it talks through this idea of just shooting"
koYib7-6b7w,1851210,1857640,"variety in more detail.  So I'll put a link to that down below in the description,  more homework for you to watch after this one."
koYib7-6b7w,1857640,1863159,So it did take me a while to get up the trail  because I was stopping and shooting  and getting all these different elements
koYib7-6b7w,1863160,1868630,"as I was going along.  Now, when I got to the fire lookout,  I turned this corner and boom,"
koYib7-6b7w,1868630,1873860,"it was right there and I could see it, and I was close.  I knew at that point I needed to stop"
koYib7-6b7w,1873860,1879120,"and shoot a scene here,  because the approach to the fire lookout is a key element"
koYib7-6b7w,1879120,1885980,"to help tell the story.  That's gonna be a buildup moment because you'll see,  this is the shot that I was wanting to build up to."
koYib7-6b7w,1885980,1892050,"I got this drone shot of the fire lookout.  It's an Epic shot.  If I turned the corner and said,  hey, there's the fire lookout."
koYib7-6b7w,1892050,1898070,"And then I show the shot.  There's no buildup, there's no anticipation.  The climax in the final moment."
koYib7-6b7w,1898070,1905560,"The reason that we all came up on this journey together.  So I wanted to build this up.  So here, I actually spent some time and thought through,"
koYib7-6b7w,1905560,1911820,how am I gonna build up to this fire lookout reveal moment.  So I shot a bunch of different elements as I was moving up
koYib7-6b7w,1911820,1917882,to the fire lookout.  I got the moment where I had to sit down the bike.  I did another talking bit to the camera.
koYib7-6b7w,1917882,1924300,"""That's said set up, I'm almost there.""  I did some different B roll shots  going up to the fire lookout.  And then I got reaction shots of me,"
koYib7-6b7w,1924300,1932410,as well as some shots where the fire lookout was obscured  in a way where you see me moving through the frame
koYib7-6b7w,1932410,1939850,"and I'm getting there,  but it's not fully showing the entire thing yet.  And the reason for that is you wanna have a big reveal."
koYib7-6b7w,1939850,1945809,"You wanna have a buildup,  whether it's a buildup throughout your video,  or you find these moments where you can really build up"
koYib7-6b7w,1945810,1952919,"to a revealing shot,  you wanna take those moments and really milk them,  and really build them out because in your edit,"
koYib7-6b7w,1952920,1958960,"you're gonna find that these moments  are gonna help craft your story,  and they're gonna help keep your audience engaged."
koYib7-6b7w,1958960,1964130,"So I got up to the top of the fire lookout,  obviously I kind of hung out there for a little bit,  drink some water chilled out,"
koYib7-6b7w,1964130,1969190,"but then I got a bunch of different shots up here,  because this was the whole reason I shot this video"
koYib7-6b7w,1969190,1974460,"wanting to get to the fire lookout.  I wanted to find what was up there.  I wanted to tell the story of, you know,"
koYib7-6b7w,1974460,1979750,"am I gonna be able to make it?  And then once I'm up there, what's there.  So I shot a bunch of different B roll."
koYib7-6b7w,1979750,1985160,"I did some talking bits that wrap up the vlog  that talk about, what I found and some things about it,"
koYib7-6b7w,1985160,1990180,"and finish the vlog there.  Now, one thing that I missed and something that,"
koYib7-6b7w,1990180,1997490,"I know that I could've made better  would be showing the trip down,  because I talk about, I set up that this is a big mountain"
koYib7-6b7w,1997490,2003200,I'm climbing that there's a lot of obstacles in the way.  And I think a lot of my audience would be interested
koYib7-6b7w,2003200,2008410,"in seeing that downhill portion,  because that's like the fun part of a climb like this."
koYib7-6b7w,2008410,2015280,"And I just forgot a GoPro, I forgot a three 60 camera.  And because of that,  I had to wrap up the video at the fire lookout."
koYib7-6b7w,2015280,2021910,"So for me, I would have extended this video  a little bit longer,  done a music sequence with like a three 60 camera"
koYib7-6b7w,2021910,2027780,and then showed the whole element.  When I was like bombing down the mountain on a mountain bike  in this Epic landscape.
koYib7-6b7w,2027780,2034059,"Now I could have done some of it with the drone,  but it just is not the same.  Like I needed to have some more elements.  So I just scratched that element."
koYib7-6b7w,2034060,2039220,And I ended the video at the top of the summit.  So how do you know when to enter your video?
koYib7-6b7w,2039220,2044799,"Well, you need to shoot to edit.  So this is a concept that I learned back in film school.  It's something that you're gonna use"
koYib7-6b7w,2044800,2052450,"in all of your videos,  because you always wanna be thinking of your final video.  You don't wanna just shoot and then go back in your edit"
koYib7-6b7w,2052450,2058330,"and then try to piece it together.  You wanna shoot to edit.  So as you're shooting, always be thinking in your head,"
koYib7-6b7w,2058330,2064810,"okay, how is this gonna tie into the story?  Or how is this gonna work?  Is this a setup?  Is this a wrap up of this section?"
koYib7-6b7w,2064810,2071700,"Am I tying this in a nice little bow,  or do I need to add more to the story?  So I need to set up something else,"
koYib7-6b7w,2071700,2078540,"always be thinking through how is the story  gonna be crafted?  And again, this is a skill you're gonna be in the moment"
koYib7-6b7w,2078540,2085060,"and you're gonna be shooting.  And then once you start thinking through the story  and you have your plan, you're gonna realize like,"
koYib7-6b7w,2085060,2091720,"Oh, I need to capture this B roll  'cause that's gonna really help tell the story.  So always be shooting to edit,"
koYib7-6b7w,2091720,2096800,always be thinking through what is the final project  gonna look like?  How am I gonna tie this footage together?
koYib7-6b7w,2096800,2101970,And take a step back.  Don't always be recording and doing the thing.  Take a step back sometimes.
koYib7-6b7w,2101970,2107300,"And just give yourself a moment to think through the footage  that you shot, pull up your camera, review the clips,"
koYib7-6b7w,2107300,2113770,"go through them and be like, okay, I got this, this, this,  this, okay, I'm missing this element.  And I know I'm gonna need it in the edit."
koYib7-6b7w,2113770,2120420,"So shooting to edit is gonna help you find more success  because you're gonna make sure that you get everything,  that you need to tell your story."
koYib7-6b7w,2120420,2126297,"I was at the top of the mountain.  I realized I was sitting there,  I was looking at the trail and I was like,  ""Oh, I forgot my GoPro."
koYib7-6b7w,2126297,2132250,"""Forgot my three 60 camera.""  That is what I need to finish up the story.  So instead of wrapping up the story  at the bottom of the trail,"
koYib7-6b7w,2132250,2137990,"like I was planning to originally,  because I would have had this downhill adventure,"
koYib7-6b7w,2137990,2143560,"I decided to just end the story at the top of the lookout,  because I knew I was gonna need something to wrap up"
koYib7-6b7w,2143560,2150019,"the video up there on the summit.  So I just did it right then and ended the video  thought through the edit in my head,"
koYib7-6b7w,2150020,2155460,realized that I'm not gonna have this whole section  that I was planning to do.  So I just wrapped it up.
koYib7-6b7w,2155460,2160560,"So let's talk about cinematic shooting for a minute,  because personally, I come from a filmmaking background."
koYib7-6b7w,2160560,2166280,"When I approached my videos,  I wanna have more of a cinematic style to my B roll.  Not everyone is gonna wanna achieve"
koYib7-6b7w,2166280,2172720,the same kind of cinematic look.  You might just be running around with your phone  and you're happy with just grabbing some B roll shots.
koYib7-6b7w,2172720,2178900,You gotta remember you don't have to have amazing B roll.  You don't have to have drone shots.  You don't have to have gimbal work.
koYib7-6b7w,2178900,2185870,"That's a personal preference.  And that comes from a style  that you're creating on your videos.  There are plenty of creators out there who have,"
koYib7-6b7w,2185870,2192240,"mediocre, decent, you know, B roll.  that's just, shot with like a phone  and their videos crush it."
koYib7-6b7w,2192240,2198500,"And that's the thing  like you really have to think through story,  'cause that's more important.  Is this B roll, helping you tell your story,"
koYib7-6b7w,2198500,2205260,"or is the B roll just there to,  show off your skills as a cinematographer.  Sometimes, that makes sense."
koYib7-6b7w,2205260,2211100,"And yes, you wanna show off your skills,  but more importantly,  you wanna help take your viewer along on the journey."
koYib7-6b7w,2211100,2217480,"Unless you're someone who does like specific camera  reviewed style vlogs, having the cinematic B roll,"
koYib7-6b7w,2217480,2222860,isn't always necessary and having pointless cinematic  B roll isn't necessary.
koYib7-6b7w,2222860,2227890,"I think if your B roll helps tell your story,  you can ramp up the level of your B roll,"
koYib7-6b7w,2227890,2234230,"make it better, and make it more cinematic,  make it beautiful.  But if it's not helping craft your story,  then you know, get rid of it."
koYib7-6b7w,2234230,2240210,"This is something that,  you hear about in filmmaking  and that is you can leave it on the cutting room floor."
koYib7-6b7w,2240210,2245819,"There's a lot of times where you end up pulling out B roll  shots that you think were the best in the world,"
koYib7-6b7w,2245820,2253260,"but if they don't help tell your story,  you're not gonna be using them.  So don't get stuck on just creating beautiful looking shots."
koYib7-6b7w,2253260,2261309,"They are great to add in,  and that's why I bring extra gear with me.  And that's why I bring gimbals and drones,  because I want some of these shots that look awesome"
koYib7-6b7w,2261310,2267830,"because when you put them in the context of a story,  it really ramps up the quality, but it's not necessary."
koYib7-6b7w,2267830,2274770,"You could just shoot some quick B roll shots  with your phone, and if it helps tell your story,  it's gonna be better than the person who didn't capture"
koYib7-6b7w,2274770,2280520,"story-driven B roll shots.  So now after shooting everything I needed for my vlog,"
koYib7-6b7w,2280520,2285790,I then head into editing.  So let's pull up Final Cut.  I use Final Cut for all of my edits.
koYib7-6b7w,2285790,2292080,"You might use different editing software.  You don't have to use Final Cut,  but I do like it for creating YouTube content"
koYib7-6b7w,2292080,2298580,"'cause it makes it super easy to cut.  So before we get into the actual editing,  let me show you how I set up my files"
koYib7-6b7w,2298580,2304240,because file structure and organization  is gonna make it easier to edit.  So here is my Butler Peak folder.
koYib7-6b7w,2304240,2310010,I do all of my folders based on the date.  And then I put a title. Now I have my Final Cut project.
koYib7-6b7w,2310010,2315760,I do a specific Final Cut project for each video.  I have my exports and then I have my media.
koYib7-6b7w,2315760,2322869,"And in my media,  I've separated out by all the cameras I'm using.  So I have my drone, I have my full frame camera,"
koYib7-6b7w,2322870,2328380,"I have my phone, I have voiceover,  which is, is something we add an edit"
koYib7-6b7w,2328380,2335560,and I'll get to that in a second.  And then we have the ZV-1.  So these are all the cameras that I used for this project.
koYib7-6b7w,2335560,2342130,Now I'm gonna bring all these into Final Cut  and here's a pro tip I actually have a templated Final Cut
koYib7-6b7w,2342130,2348470,file that I just copy every time I start a new project  and it has all my titles and everything already built.
koYib7-6b7w,2348470,2355319,"So that every time I go in to make a video,  everything's there ready to go.  And I don't really have to rebuild different elements."
koYib7-6b7w,2355320,2361869,"So if you have things that you use video after video,  after video, create a templated project file."
koYib7-6b7w,2361870,2367180,"And then whenever you start a new project,  take that template, copy it,  bring it into your folder"
koYib7-6b7w,2367180,2372210,so that you always are starting at a point  where you have everything built.  And let me know down the comments.
koYib7-6b7w,2372210,2377490,If you want me to cover this more specifically in a video  talking about these templates.  And because I made the folder structure
koYib7-6b7w,2377490,2383890,"before I even opened a Final Cut,  you can see that all of those are now appearing as keywords  because I brought them in as the folders."
koYib7-6b7w,2383890,2389119,"So we need to start a timeline.  And like I said, I have template a timelines.  So for this, we're gonna make a new timeline"
koYib7-6b7w,2389120,2395550,"and we'll work off that.  So as you can see, when I pull up this templated timeline,  I have all these elements that I've already built."
koYib7-6b7w,2395550,2402710,"So I have my name. I have some texts,  lower texts, player, squares,  like all these elements they use in all my videos."
koYib7-6b7w,2402710,2407809,"Now I might not be using these in these vlogs,  but this is just something I want you guys to see"
koYib7-6b7w,2407810,2413090,"that if you use different graphics and elements,  create templates of this and make it really easy to,"
koYib7-6b7w,2413090,2418630,"do video, to video, to make things faster.  So the first stage of my process is I go through  all my A roll."
koYib7-6b7w,2418630,2426510,"So all the parts where I'm talking on camera  and I chop these up,  just so they're little sequences of each of those sections."
koYib7-6b7w,2426510,2432690,"Okay, so the goal today is to go up to the Big Bear,  which there's this fire lookout."
koYib7-6b7w,2432690,2439010,"Originally, you could four-wheel all the way to Butler Peak  and you can park down.  So I'll go through and just cut out sections"
koYib7-6b7w,2439010,2444970,that are boring.  So I try to make it move faster  'cause the key is you don't wanna bore an audience.  So I'll chop out little sections
koYib7-6b7w,2444970,2449666,and make the story move faster.  First part of this hill.  So the first part
koYib7-6b7w,2452820,2457373,"I kind of left them 'cause I'm riding my bike.  So the first part of this, so this is gonna be,"
koYib7-6b7w,2458490,2464720,"I'm riding my bike.  So this is gonna be a way to climb,  basically uphill the whole way."
koYib7-6b7w,2466890,2472930,So what I'm doing is cutting out any dead time  or any parts where I repeat.  So I just wanna make it seamless from beginning to end
koYib7-6b7w,2472930,2478350,"and make it move.  Now, obviously you don't wanna chop out  every break when you're talking,"
koYib7-6b7w,2478350,2484700,"but depending on the style of content you're shooting,  you might wanna cut out a lot of these like,  ums and oohs and ahs."
koYib7-6b7w,2484700,2491420,"And I did a video all about jump cuts,  hiding, jump cuts.  It might be something for you to check out after this video."
koYib7-6b7w,2491420,2497550,"Again, I'm trying to give you guys  as much information as possible.  So I apologize if I'm giving you guys a ton of homework,"
koYib7-6b7w,2497550,2503703,but we're doing jump cuts here.  So you might need to hide these later.  I'll put a link in description on how you hide jump cuts.
koYib7-6b7w,2504640,2512509,"That's a ways out there.  So this is gonna be...  Since it's a ways up there,"
koYib7-6b7w,2512509,2518808,I can see Butler Peak off in the distance.  You go up in the distance.
koYib7-6b7w,2518809,2524720,"It's a ways up there,  but you can see Butler Peak off in the distance."
koYib7-6b7w,2524720,2533349,"It's a ways out there.  So this is gonna be a ready to climb,  basically up until the whole way, the whole way."
koYib7-6b7w,2533350,2539570,"It'd be a nice ride down to the Jeep.  So after I've gone through and cut all these story beats,"
koYib7-6b7w,2539570,2545050,"I could see what I have on the timeline.  So there's, I have all these different sections"
koYib7-6b7w,2545050,2550700,"that are me talking to camera.  I have the setup at the beginning,  which talks about what I'm gonna encounter."
koYib7-6b7w,2550700,2556240,"I have this section here,  which talks about getting to the trailhead  some anticipation, these sections,"
koYib7-6b7w,2556240,2562210,"which talk about trail different things,  I'm encountering as I'm going along.  So this is the actual journey that I have this section"
koYib7-6b7w,2562210,2567450,"that talks about getting to the lookout,  and kind of building up the anticipation.  And then I have the reveal,"
koYib7-6b7w,2567450,2573470,"me on the summit and the wrap up.  So when you're shooting,  you're thinking through all these elements  and because I thought about them,"
koYib7-6b7w,2573470,2578930,"as I was shooting this video.  Now, when you go to the edit,  you can see clearly how all these elements"
koYib7-6b7w,2578930,2586099,"start coming together  and you actually have your whole story, craft it out,  just in these elements of me talking to camera."
koYib7-6b7w,2586100,2591290,"We haven't gotten to the B roll yet.  So the next step for me,  is I actually start digging into music"
koYib7-6b7w,2591290,2597400,and I use Epidemic Sound for all of my music.  And what I'll do is start looking for different sounds
koYib7-6b7w,2597400,2602430,"and ideas that might encompass the story.  So let's go into moods,"
koYib7-6b7w,2602430,2606543,"because I think when you're looking for music,  going by mood is a great way to do it."
koYib7-6b7w,2607580,2613359,"This, I have some elements of this Epic adventure.  So I really want some cinematic, Epic music."
koYib7-6b7w,2613360,2618763,"And, you know, you can sort by Epic and then maybe dreamy  or let's do Epic and hopeful."
koYib7-6b7w,2620010,2625325,And then we just start listening to all the music.  (upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,2626823,2632496,(dynamic music)  (upbeat epic music)
koYib7-6b7w,2634560,2640473,"You know, after skimming through some songs,  if that mood is not really working for me,  then I'm gonna switch it up  and try to find something else."
koYib7-6b7w,2642589,2648590,"(upbeat music)  So once you find something you like,"
koYib7-6b7w,2648590,2653930,"you can use this button, that's find similar.  And it's gonna show you similar tracks  to the sound that you like."
koYib7-6b7w,2655517,2657934,(epic music)
koYib7-6b7w,2673947,2676530,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,2681290,2687309,"The ones I found different sounds that I like,  I'll create a new music folder in the media  and I'll drop all of it in there,"
koYib7-6b7w,2687310,2694030,"just because I wanna keep everything organized.  Now I'm gonna grab more tracks  than I think I'm gonna use,  because you might wanna switch some tracks out"
koYib7-6b7w,2694030,2700590,"when you're actually creating the video.  But if you find some general sounds,  things that feel the way that you want, then you know,"
koYib7-6b7w,2700590,2706100,you'll start playing around with that.  And I like to use music to help guide my edits.  So a lot of times I'll put my music
koYib7-6b7w,2706100,2712423,in and that's what I use to help edit my B roll  together and then tie scenes together.  So music for me is super important.
koYib7-6b7w,2714200,2721610,"So I found this kind of epic sound,  and I realized that I need something before this footage"
koYib7-6b7w,2721610,2726970,"of me talking, I'm gonna need a hook.  That's one key element.  When it comes to creating vlogs is you need to hook."
koYib7-6b7w,2726970,2734453,"So you either plan out a hook or in this case,  I'm just trying to find something that was really  interesting in this video to use as my hook."
koYib7-6b7w,2734453,2740010,(dynamic music)  Now this next track that I've found
koYib7-6b7w,2740010,2748644,"has this kind of like driving feel to it.  It's kind of like anticipation.  It's good to build up,  ramp up the energy to get into the actual meat of the video."
koYib7-6b7w,2748644,2751227,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,2758040,2763790,Now the next song that I chose is gonna go over  all the elements when I'm actually mountain biking  up to the summit.
koYib7-6b7w,2763790,2769240,"And I think just has this kind of like adventure feel to it.  It's kind of mellow, but it's also got a driving beat."
koYib7-6b7w,2769240,2775420,So music there's no right or wrong way to do it.  And it also comes down to style.  These are the styles of tracks that I like using.
koYib7-6b7w,2775420,2781109,"You might have a completely different style,  but you wanna think,  how is it gonna make your audience feel"
koYib7-6b7w,2781110,2785335,when they're watching the video?  (upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,2788545,2795410,"(dynamic music)  Okay, so this is a great track for the reveal"
koYib7-6b7w,2795410,2801517,"'cause I love the build of this song.  And then it gets to this point where it's like, boom,  there's a moment for a reveal."
koYib7-6b7w,2801517,2804184,(dynamic music)
koYib7-6b7w,2806660,2812760,"Cool, so I got my music.  I have these four tracks  that I'm gonna use throughout the video,  and this is gonna help drive the rest of the edits"
koYib7-6b7w,2812760,2820010,"for the B roll.  So now I just cut the hook.  And what I found was the shot was the reveal.  So I have an Epic landscape,"
koYib7-6b7w,2820010,2827200,"drone pulls back to reveal the fire lookout.  And then I figured use this,  to kind of preface what's coming."
koYib7-6b7w,2827200,2832290,"So you understand that, like I get there,  but I'm gonna set up, you know,"
koYib7-6b7w,2832290,2838410,"everything that goes along the journey.  There is still this idea of like,  what is gonna be there once I get there."
koYib7-6b7w,2838410,2845240,"So I'm revealing a little bit early, but to do that,  I'm trying to hook my audience  and you can see that I'm walking up the path"
koYib7-6b7w,2845240,2850950,"as I get to this hut.  So there is some of that anticipation of like,  well, what happens when he gets to the top?"
koYib7-6b7w,2850950,2857940,"And then I use this first track,  I cut it up a little bit, just so I could have,  15 seconds of it versus a longer portion."
koYib7-6b7w,2857940,2860523,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,2876010,2881620,"Blackout screen, go into me talking about,  what is about to happen."
koYib7-6b7w,2881620,2886660,So that was a hook draws your audience in.  So you wanna look for these hook moments.
koYib7-6b7w,2886660,2893290,That was a reveal that I used as a hook.  So then I go into the talking bits  where I'm setting up the story.
koYib7-6b7w,2893290,2899270,"And then at the end of this, didn't really pack on.  I got to get all my stuff ready to go."
koYib7-6b7w,2899270,2905610,"Didn't really pack last night, like I should have.  So I bring in the music, right as I finish up this wrap up"
koYib7-6b7w,2905610,2912950,and I go into just some B roll shots.  So I talk about the fact that I didn't pack.  So I wanna show some of that show packing of the car.
koYib7-6b7w,2912950,2920020,This is all B roll that I captured.  And I didn't really know what I was gonna do with it yet.  Now I was playing around with this footage of the drive
koYib7-6b7w,2920020,2925120,"originally, I thought, okay,  I'll do a bunch of shots of me driving,  but ended up being pretty boring."
koYib7-6b7w,2925120,2932230,"So I needed to add in some history,  and this is where voiceover could come into play.  So because I'm doing something that has a little bit"
koYib7-6b7w,2932230,2939780,"of a history, this fire lookout was built in 1931.  There's a little bit of history that I need to set up  to talk about what a fire lookout is."
koYib7-6b7w,2939780,2946119,"This is a great opportunity.  I've set up the story.  Now it's time to give some backstory on,  fire huts in general."
koYib7-6b7w,2946120,2952812,"So as I'm setting this up,  I have the music playing underneath, down here.  You can see I've added a little"
koYib7-6b7w,2952812,2958069,(upbeat music) (engine revs)  truck sound effect.  That's a sound effect that I got just off Epidemic Sound.
koYib7-6b7w,2958070,2965890,"You can use sound effects,  put them in places to just enhance the story a little bit.  I set up that I'm driving two hours, 16 minutes."
koYib7-6b7w,2965890,2972230,"I got a shot of me, a reaction shot.  Like I said, you always wanna get reaction shots.  And then it's just a bunch of boring driving shots."
koYib7-6b7w,2972230,2977540,"So instead of doing a bunch of boring driving shots,  I brought down my music, and I added this voiceover."
koYib7-6b7w,2977540,2983420,So let's just listen to this voiceover.  The Butler Peak fire lookout was originally built in 1931
koYib7-6b7w,2983420,2989799,and fire lookouts were built so that Rangers could see  the three 60 panoramic view.  And they'd be able to see the smoke coming off
koYib7-6b7w,2989800,2996960,"of where a fire started.  So I created this voiceover,  I just use my Zoom H4N right here,  did this boom made a voiceover."
koYib7-6b7w,2996960,3004010,"Now, instead of just putting this over driving footage,  I wanted to find some archival footage.  So I found this shot of Butler Peak in the forties."
koYib7-6b7w,3004010,3010210,"Then I have this shot that I actually shot from the top  when I was there, and I added some effects to it."
koYib7-6b7w,3010210,3016580,"So I went through,  I added some aged film and a color originally.  It was just that shot,"
koYib7-6b7w,3016580,3023530,"but because I was trying to make something feel like,  it was old,  I added some color and aged and I aged the shots"
koYib7-6b7w,3023530,3030570,so that it looks like it's part of history.  We're playing into this whole idea of crafting your history
koYib7-6b7w,3030570,3035640,"behind this fire lookout.  So these two shots with the voiceover,"
koYib7-6b7w,3035640,3040720,I use this shot of driving up the mountain  to kind of get into the scene.
koYib7-6b7w,3040720,3046760,And then I came out on the mountain.  So it bookended these two historical shots.
koYib7-6b7w,3046760,3053510,So it shows the PA and I use this to help pass the time  because I needed to get from driving to the trailhead.
koYib7-6b7w,3053510,3060340,"Eric and I just met.  I just got up to Big Bear.  And I just met up with my parents  who have a place up here,"
koYib7-6b7w,3060340,3066910,"and they're actually gonna drive  with me to the trailhead.  So now we got into the scene where I'm talking about,"
koYib7-6b7w,3066910,3074330,what to expect and where we're going.  You can see I'm transitioning time  and trying to give you more information  in the vlog so that it keeps your interest
koYib7-6b7w,3074330,3079809,"and keeps you watching longer.  So music wise,  I use the music to kind of lay over the section."
koYib7-6b7w,3079810,3086330,"I brought it down when I'm doing the voiceover,  and then I had it fade out before I got into me talking.  So I let the music drift away."
koYib7-6b7w,3086330,3091680,"You don't always need music to fill everything.  I like to use it and come up, back down, go up, back down."
koYib7-6b7w,3091680,3097320,"I like to use pacing in my videos.  So you wanna pace things out,  and not always be blanketing music from beginning to end."
koYib7-6b7w,3097320,3105480,"So when I finished my talk here, we get into the trailhead.  So I have some B roll of that.  I cut a few shots together and I added some music."
koYib7-6b7w,3105480,3109639,"Expect from this trail.  (engine revs)  Shoot on my Jeep,"
koYib7-6b7w,3110530,3114323,"then I go into the road, closed sign that sets up,  I got to the trailhead."
koYib7-6b7w,3116610,3123790,"And then in my bike sitting there.  This was actually shot later,  but I needed some footage to set up"
koYib7-6b7w,3123790,3129170,that I was about to go on this bike adventure.  So you might not always use your B roll
koYib7-6b7w,3129170,3135190,"in chronological order.  If you need to just capture all these different elements  and something you capture later,"
koYib7-6b7w,3135190,3143010,"it might actually work earlier.  So in this case, I need to set up the mountain bike.  So I had the shot that I captured from like two hours later"
koYib7-6b7w,3143010,3149226,"and it ended up working great and I also reversed it.  So it had this kind of reveal on it.  Normal, the shot looks like this,"
koYib7-6b7w,3149227,3154819,"(upbeat music)  and I decided just to reverse it,"
koYib7-6b7w,3154820,3162880,"just a personal preference to show trail.  You kind of see the trail off to the right hand side,"
koYib7-6b7w,3162880,3170740,but I'm more focusing on the bike.  And then I go into an empty shot and I would go into frame.
koYib7-6b7w,3170740,3176190,It's a great way to kind of start a scene  is start with an empty frame and then work your way into it.
koYib7-6b7w,3176190,3182220,"Whether you're walking into it,  or your other people are coming into it,  but having something where it's an empty frame,"
koYib7-6b7w,3182220,3188687,and then you appear into it.  That's kind of like the beginning of a journey.  (upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,3189636,3195599,And I actually had my mom for this section  because they helped hike at the beginning.  So I had my mom shoot some footage.
koYib7-6b7w,3195600,3202910,She just shot on her iPhone.  If you have people around you to grab these quick shots  of like you doing something because you're vlogging
koYib7-6b7w,3202910,3208310,"and you need someone to shoot you and say,  hey, do this horizontal for me,  and just stay in this one position."
koYib7-6b7w,3208310,3214490,"And then you can do what you need to do,  or just use a tripod.  But if you have people around,  you can ask them to shoot for you."
koYib7-6b7w,3214490,3220460,"And these kind of shots  are more important than like sexy B roll.  Because some of these shots where it's just a simple,"
koYib7-6b7w,3220460,3226531,you coming into frame has more emphasis in your story  rather than just like beautiful shot of landscape.
koYib7-6b7w,3226531,3232340,"(upbeat music)  All right, so my...  So I've set up the trail"
koYib7-6b7w,3232340,3238280,"and now I need to start talking about, what's going on.  So I added another vlog element here,  kind of set up what's going on."
koYib7-6b7w,3238280,3243520,"And if you have B roll that goes over  when you're talking about your footage,  you can include that."
koYib7-6b7w,3243520,3248839,"And so you could use B roll to go over shots,  to help show what you're talking about."
koYib7-6b7w,3248840,3254933,"So that's why you wanna grab B roll of things  that you're talking about, and then extra B roll as well.  See, that's a ways out there."
koYib7-6b7w,3257130,3264020,"So more shots of me riding,  and then some of the scene."
koYib7-6b7w,3264020,3270339,"And because I'm on a mountain bike,  I wanna make sure I'm capturing things in motion.  This is why I wanted to bring along in gimbal."
koYib7-6b7w,3270340,3276950,"I have, you know, shots moving forward to the side.  You can see I'm getting a range of different shots."
koYib7-6b7w,3276950,3284400,"I have shot of me riding again.  So I'm just setting up the ride.  And then we get into this next section where I talk about,"
koYib7-6b7w,3284400,3289680,"some of the issues that are coming up on the trail.  I've just been climbing, and climbing"
koYib7-6b7w,3290805,3298880,"into views of the valley, where I started way out there,  in the distance, but is trail is interesting."
koYib7-6b7w,3298880,3306619,It's like a mix of sand and rock and...  That's just a simple shot that I got on my iPhone
koYib7-6b7w,3306620,3311860,"I just, I was talking about standing rock.  So I grabbed a shot.  I didn't know if I'd use it.  Sure enough I mean, it,"
koYib7-6b7w,3311860,3318770,"it shows what I'm talking about,  and it's not even that good of a shot, but it is what it is.  A bunch of areas are washed out."
koYib7-6b7w,3318770,3325099,"So you have to carry your bike here and there.  So that's footage I captured from earlier in the day,  I just got a tripod shot."
koYib7-6b7w,3325100,3330440,"I walked through the frame with my bike.  I got some shots of the washout,"
koYib7-6b7w,3330440,3336990,"and I didn't know if I was gonna make a whole section  on the washout,  but I ended up just using it as visuals over,"
koYib7-6b7w,3336990,3343180,"this part where I'm talking about,  just helps move the story along.  I didn't need to put like all this emphasis on this washout."
koYib7-6b7w,3343180,3349380,"Like I have a bunch of shots from it, but looking at it,  it just made more sense just to pop this in,  get some B roll over me, talking,"
koYib7-6b7w,3349380,3352873,keep the story moving forward.  And is a client.
koYib7-6b7w,3355520,3360563,"There's not a whole lot of shade.  So it's just not stuffed sun just beating down on you,"
koYib7-6b7w,3361510,3367830,the whole way up.  Think I'm about halfway.  I've set up a bunch of different elements.
koYib7-6b7w,3367830,3373030,"I've showed the trail, I did it in this way,  where you were closer with me at the beginning,"
koYib7-6b7w,3373030,3378350,"like shots that were on the trail.  So because I have variety of shots that I've captured,"
koYib7-6b7w,3378350,3386099,I figured this is a great moment to reveal  more of the scene.  So this of start close with me and then reveal out.
koYib7-6b7w,3386100,3391840,And that's why I decided to do a drone section.  (upbeat music)  You get to see the surrounding land.
koYib7-6b7w,3391840,3398840,"It sets up what the trail looks like, bigger shots of it.  And then the super extreme wide shots of me,"
koYib7-6b7w,3398840,3400333,in this vast landscape.
koYib7-6b7w,3404774,3410150,"So I didn't drag on too much of this footage,  but I really wanted to show,  I am out in the middle of nowhere."
koYib7-6b7w,3410150,3416240,"And so I wanted to have this emphasis around,  the vast landscape.  So I had to get, get some of these drone shots"
koYib7-6b7w,3416240,3421550,and these drone shots  were hard to get cause I was by myself.  So I basically had to get the drone  in these different positions
koYib7-6b7w,3421550,3427920,and fly and get shots of myself.  Now you don't wanna drag on too much in your edit.
koYib7-6b7w,3427920,3434770,"So like I've showed the trail,  I've showed some of the challenges  that come up on the trail.  I've milked that I've got enough of that in the edit."
koYib7-6b7w,3434770,3440020,"I don't wanna do more and more B roll sections of this.  It'll get boring, like I wanna keep the story moving."
koYib7-6b7w,3440020,3445109,So the next section is we need to get to something.  And this is where I turn the corner.
koYib7-6b7w,3445110,3451800,"It's set up that, I see the peak in the distance,  a quick little B roll section of some footage"
koYib7-6b7w,3451800,3458650,"that shows this last moment.  I've put my bike down,  and I have this moment where I say, ""I'm almost there."""
koYib7-6b7w,3458650,3464750,"All right, just made it to the spot  where I need to drop my bike off.  The last little bit, it's just this walk up the trail,"
koYib7-6b7w,3464750,3471950,"fire hut, just above.  (dynamic music)  And because this is the final climax of the video,"
koYib7-6b7w,3471950,3478287,I'm gonna use music under the whole thing.  And I'm gonna actually find the moment  where I want the music to hit.
koYib7-6b7w,3478287,3485920,(upbeat music)  That's the moment I wanna use for the reveal.  So I have all this buildup and I basically laid it out
koYib7-6b7w,3485920,3491700,and changed the volume.  So we started out with full volume because it's some B roll
koYib7-6b7w,3491700,3497550,"kind of showing the surrounding, we're almost there.  There's Butler Peak, I bring down the music.  I talk for a minute."
koYib7-6b7w,3497550,3504670,"All right, just made it to the spot where...  I show that it's in the distance out of focus."
koYib7-6b7w,3504670,3509819,"And then I bring the music back up  for another little B roll section,  but this is more of a specific"
koYib7-6b7w,3509820,3515349,"move the story forward B roll.  So I show the trail,  I show my feet."
koYib7-6b7w,3515350,3520750,"I show my reaction.  Again, you want variety of shots.  I showed the trail again,"
koYib7-6b7w,3520750,3528700,"but this time I pan up to reveal where we're going.  So you're, getting more information with each shot"
koYib7-6b7w,3528700,3535579,and it's moving the story towards that moment  where we're gonna actually get the reveal.  So then I grabbed the shot using a drone
koYib7-6b7w,3535580,3541040,"of me walking up the staircase,  the music starts getting a little bit more intense."
koYib7-6b7w,3541040,3546220,"I have this surrounding shot that's from the summit.  It kind of shows what the view is, but at the same time,"
koYib7-6b7w,3546220,3553520,"it's obscured in a way, and I like that.  So like, it keeps you wanting more.  And then I show POV shot going up the stairs"
koYib7-6b7w,3553520,3559330,and you can see I'm building to the big reveal.  I'm putting all these shots together.  That's moving you forward and you're wanting more
koYib7-6b7w,3559330,3565320,"and you wanna see what happens.  So if you have these moments  where it comes to the big reveal,  make sure you capture enough footage"
koYib7-6b7w,3565320,3571050,to get all these moments.  I sat here and shot a ton of footage  to be able to craft this element of the story.
koYib7-6b7w,3571050,3578340,"You might think the reveals coming, but I do a POV again,  looking down again, obscuring the view."
koYib7-6b7w,3578340,3584033,"And I'm capturing all these different elements,  because I know in the edit,  I'm gonna wanna put all these pieces together  to do this big reveal."
koYib7-6b7w,3585563,3588230,(dynamic music)
koYib7-6b7w,3596488,3599071,(upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,3618690,3627120,"This shot right here, this is the money shot.  This is the most important shot of the film.  It reveals the fire lookout on top of the peak,"
koYib7-6b7w,3627120,3632859,"I do this crazy circling shot all around the lookout.  So a couple of things,  I made sure I had enough drone battery"
koYib7-6b7w,3632860,3639590,"that I was gonna have it up there,  because that was something I was anticipating.  And I've shot it in a few different ways  to really show this reveal."
koYib7-6b7w,3639590,3646220,"This is the purpose of doing this vlog  was getting to this fire lookout.  And then, so the last section,  I have these talking bits where,"
koYib7-6b7w,3646220,3652289,"I'm talking about what it's like up there,  what I'm finding and some just different information  for this video."
koYib7-6b7w,3652290,3658190,And I did this all over music because this is the finale.  This is the grand finale.  So I have the music go up and down
koYib7-6b7w,3658190,3665009,"and you can hear that it let the music drop down  and have the music go lower when I'm talking,  bring it up to ramp up the intensity."
koYib7-6b7w,3665010,3670100,"When I show the shots at the fire lookout.  And again, I wanted to crab shots of myself.  So I have a shot like this,"
koYib7-6b7w,3670100,3676170,"which is a drone shot of just me on the lookout,  more shots of my reaction, as I'm finding this."
koYib7-6b7w,3676170,3682270,"You just wanna capture a lot of footage.  And I ended up using only a portion of the shots  that I used, but all of it does come into play."
koYib7-6b7w,3682270,3687500,And I use snippets of everything.  (upbeat music)
koYib7-6b7w,3687500,3695470,"Oh, look who just woke up.  Someone wants to say hi.  So got a little editing assistant."
koYib7-6b7w,3695470,3700963,Now she's are you at what's up?  You wanna edit you like the microphone.
koYib7-6b7w,3704640,3711579,"Someone wants to eat it.  Does that feel good?  Hey, someone that's taken my microphone,  so I'm gonna switch cameras now."
koYib7-6b7w,3711580,3718010,"So after I have the video cut, I have the music light.  Then I go through and do my color grading  and kind of clean up any little edits"
koYib7-6b7w,3718010,3724000,"that look out of place.  Now, from there, I'll build out a title and thumbnail  things that I think will match the story"
koYib7-6b7w,3724000,3731000,"and something that's gonna be engaging.  And if you guys wanna learn more about  my YouTube upload process let me know down in the comments,"
koYib7-6b7w,3731000,3738110,I'll make a video about that.  The biggest takeaway that I want you guys  to get from this video is that you want to plan
koYib7-6b7w,3738110,3743230,"and think through story.  I know you hear this again and again,  story is most important,"
koYib7-6b7w,3743230,3748500,but it really is like story is gonna help  make you different than every other YouTube creator
koYib7-6b7w,3748500,3755430,on the platform.  Even for a very simple vlog  are the ones that are gonna stand out  from all the mess that is on YouTube.
koYib7-6b7w,3755430,3762720,"There's just so many videos being produced.  And there are so many creators out there,  who just think that you can hit record and make good videos"
koYib7-6b7w,3762720,3768150,"and people will watch them.  It comes from planning,  it comes from storytelling, and it comes from practice."
koYib7-6b7w,3768150,3774800,"So using this structure,  playing around with the different story elements  and just doing it over and over and over."
koYib7-6b7w,3774800,3782260,"Like I said, at the beginning of this video,  this vlog, isn't the best vlog in the world.  However, I really approached it,  as if I wanted to make the best vlog in the world."
koYib7-6b7w,3782260,3787300,"And you'll just do this time and time again,  you'll get better at your craft.  You'll create better stories"
koYib7-6b7w,3787300,3793619,"and then you'll build your audience  because people will be interested in the videos  that you are creating.  All right, guys, in the description,"
koYib7-6b7w,3793620,3800430,"I put a ton of resources  that bounce off of all the different things we talked about  in this video.  If you wanna go more in depth in any of those topics,"
koYib7-6b7w,3800430,3807090,"make sure you head down the description.  And I highly suggest you check out this video right here,  which is my first guide on how to vlog."
koYib7-6b7w,3807090,3812280,"It's a great followup video to this,  because it's gonna talk even more about some different ideas"
koYib7-6b7w,3812280,3817300,"and different things that you should think about,  before you press record.  All right, guys, I'll see you over there."
