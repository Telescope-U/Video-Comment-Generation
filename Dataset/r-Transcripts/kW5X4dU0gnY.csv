kW5X4dU0gnY,250,1210,"- Thanks, Lenovo and AMD"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1210,3240,for sponsoring a portion of today's video.
kW5X4dU0gnY,3240,6330,Lenovo's slim 7 laptop offers excellent performance
kW5X4dU0gnY,6330,7832,and fantastic battery life.
kW5X4dU0gnY,7832,11796,"All powered by AMD Ryzen 9 5,000 series mobile processors."
kW5X4dU0gnY,11796,13085,Click the link in the description
kW5X4dU0gnY,13086,15550,or watch till the end to learn more.
kW5X4dU0gnY,15550,16674,I just treated myself
kW5X4dU0gnY,16674,20453,to the greatest monitor that money can buy.
kW5X4dU0gnY,21320,22560,20 years ago.
kW5X4dU0gnY,22560,23699,Whoo ow
kW5X4dU0gnY,23699,25800,"Oh, wow."
kW5X4dU0gnY,25800,26967,- [David] Wow.
kW5X4dU0gnY,28760,32340,"- But even today, this absolute unit"
kW5X4dU0gnY,32340,34370,of a desktop display goes
kW5X4dU0gnY,34370,37460,for more than $3000.
kW5X4dU0gnY,37460,41287,"Why, what could a CRT from 2002 do better"
kW5X4dU0gnY,41287,45850,than a state of the art gaming display from 2022?
kW5X4dU0gnY,45850,48605,Did I just waste my freaking money?
kW5X4dU0gnY,48605,51188,(upbeat music)
kW5X4dU0gnY,57580,59660,When LCD panels arrived on the scene
kW5X4dU0gnY,59660,61870,they had some big pants to fill.
kW5X4dU0gnY,61870,63719,The development of the CRT display
kW5X4dU0gnY,63720,65770,had a 60 year head start.
kW5X4dU0gnY,65770,68016,And what's crazy is that modern displays
kW5X4dU0gnY,68016,70299,are still playing catch up
kW5X4dU0gnY,70300,72840,to your grandma's old TV in some ways.
kW5X4dU0gnY,72840,75170,Especially when you compare to one
kW5X4dU0gnY,75170,78090,of the best consumer CRTs ever.
kW5X4dU0gnY,78090,81020,The Sony GDM FW 900.
kW5X4dU0gnY,81020,83579,But why is this thing so big?
kW5X4dU0gnY,83580,85910,Well it's because of the actual CRT
kW5X4dU0gnY,86890,88860,the cathode-ray tube.
kW5X4dU0gnY,88860,90960,In the back of this big box
kW5X4dU0gnY,90960,93909,is a heavy glass vacuum tube
kW5X4dU0gnY,93910,95900,with electron guns inside it.
kW5X4dU0gnY,95900,97800,The electrons are shot at a layer
kW5X4dU0gnY,97800,100850,of phosphorus on the glass screen at the front.
kW5X4dU0gnY,100850,103390,Now phosphorus are materials that emit light
kW5X4dU0gnY,103390,105610,when they're hit with electromagnetic radiation.
kW5X4dU0gnY,105610,107100,Remember those glow in the dark stars
kW5X4dU0gnY,107100,108520,you had on your ceiling as a kid.
kW5X4dU0gnY,108520,110229,"Well, it's the same fundamental principle"
kW5X4dU0gnY,110230,111614,"but to create a color image,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,111614,113799,we've got three electron guns
kW5X4dU0gnY,113800,116520,"one for red, one for blue, and one for green"
kW5X4dU0gnY,116520,118549,and each has their beams aimed
kW5X4dU0gnY,118550,120660,by magnets to hit the corresponding
kW5X4dU0gnY,120660,121900,section of your screen.
kW5X4dU0gnY,121900,123410,Illuminating the phosphor.
kW5X4dU0gnY,123410,126340,This whole process happens very fast
kW5X4dU0gnY,126340,128127,at full resolution on this display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,128127,132380,"It redraws the entire screen, 80 times a second"
kW5X4dU0gnY,132380,135990,but that's not even close to 240 Hertz
kW5X4dU0gnY,135990,138032,let alone 360 Hertz
kW5X4dU0gnY,138032,140069,like the fastest displays today.
kW5X4dU0gnY,140070,141692,Why pay over three grand
kW5X4dU0gnY,141692,143509,for a monitor that looks like it belongs
kW5X4dU0gnY,143509,146142,on the back of an underfunded public library.
kW5X4dU0gnY,146142,148700,Why do people want this?
kW5X4dU0gnY,148700,150870,This is where we get to my first experience with it
kW5X4dU0gnY,150870,151980,because I haven't actually gotten
kW5X4dU0gnY,151980,153269,to play with it yet.
kW5X4dU0gnY,153270,154710,"Ooh, it's on."
kW5X4dU0gnY,154710,157100,There are two basic camps.
kW5X4dU0gnY,157100,158930,There's retro gamers like Anthony
kW5X4dU0gnY,158930,161750,"and sweaty gamers like David,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,161750,162583,"sorry, David."
kW5X4dU0gnY,162583,163415,- [David] I'm a retro game.
kW5X4dU0gnY,163416,164249,- David's also a retro game.
kW5X4dU0gnY,164249,165081,You're more sweaty than sweaty
kW5X4dU0gnY,165082,165920,- [Adam] Sweaty retro.
kW5X4dU0gnY,165920,166752,- [David] That's not true.
kW5X4dU0gnY,166753,167760,Take it back.
kW5X4dU0gnY,167760,168868,- [Adam] Your a sweatro gamer.
kW5X4dU0gnY,168869,169711,- Sweatro.
kW5X4dU0gnY,169711,171758,- [Adam] 92 lbs.
kW5X4dU0gnY,171758,172590,- 92 Pounds.
kW5X4dU0gnY,173720,177420,Let's talk about what makes this CRT so special.
kW5X4dU0gnY,177420,178650,It was sorry.
kW5X4dU0gnY,178650,182040,No is a top of the line product with rare
kW5X4dU0gnY,182040,183209,for the time features
kW5X4dU0gnY,183210,185970,like a 16 by 10 aspect ratio
kW5X4dU0gnY,185970,189110,and a nearly undrivable rated resolution
kW5X4dU0gnY,189110,192200,of 2304 * 1440.
kW5X4dU0gnY,192200,194610,Add in that it's equipped with an SRGB mode
kW5X4dU0gnY,194610,196260,for super accurate colors
kW5X4dU0gnY,196260,197743,and a high vertical refresh rate.
kW5X4dU0gnY,197743,200500,And there is pretty much nothing that this thing
kW5X4dU0gnY,200500,202450,couldn't do better than early LCDs
kW5X4dU0gnY,202450,204319,and even many modern ones.
kW5X4dU0gnY,204320,207756,Like how about zero pixel response time
kW5X4dU0gnY,207756,211763,or wait how can pixel response time be zero?
kW5X4dU0gnY,212690,214620,In an LCD light shines
kW5X4dU0gnY,214620,218069,through crystals that physically shift
kW5X4dU0gnY,218070,220300,and turn to a allow the light through
kW5X4dU0gnY,220300,222060,that process takes time.
kW5X4dU0gnY,222060,225140,"But in a CRT, when an electron hits the phosphor"
kW5X4dU0gnY,225140,227550,it instantly produces a photon
kW5X4dU0gnY,227550,229780,and then stops once the electron gun
kW5X4dU0gnY,229780,231100,is no longer blasting it.
kW5X4dU0gnY,231100,233220,What actually makes the image stay
kW5X4dU0gnY,233220,234920,on the screen is a limitation
kW5X4dU0gnY,234920,237080,of our own human monkey vision.
kW5X4dU0gnY,237080,239070,When you point a high speed camera
kW5X4dU0gnY,239070,240731,at a CRT you'll actually see
kW5X4dU0gnY,240731,243577,that the entire screen is drawn line by a line
kW5X4dU0gnY,243577,245797,by a single point.
kW5X4dU0gnY,245797,247580,But when we scale time back
kW5X4dU0gnY,247580,249597,to the human perception level
kW5X4dU0gnY,249597,253120,it appears that the whole screen is lit up.
kW5X4dU0gnY,253120,254851,And that's actually why this video
kW5X4dU0gnY,254851,256450,is gonna look a little
kW5X4dU0gnY,256450,258079,bit funky because we have to play around
kW5X4dU0gnY,258079,259370,with our shutter speed in order
kW5X4dU0gnY,259370,261949,to make the screen stop flickering
kW5X4dU0gnY,261950,262933,and looking weird.
kW5X4dU0gnY,264130,265410,It's so crisp.
kW5X4dU0gnY,265410,269910,I haven't seen a CRT of anywhere near this grade in
kW5X4dU0gnY,269910,272730,"man, I had LCD in 2004."
kW5X4dU0gnY,272730,275120,"You see that slow moving line,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,275120,276120,going down the screen.
kW5X4dU0gnY,276120,277880,That's due to the desynchronization
kW5X4dU0gnY,277880,279410,between the frame rate of our camera
kW5X4dU0gnY,279410,282030,and the refresh rate of this display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,282030,283410,Let's put it back to 80.
kW5X4dU0gnY,283410,284243,That better David.
kW5X4dU0gnY,284243,285076,- [David] That's so much better.
kW5X4dU0gnY,285076,285909,- Wonderful.
kW5X4dU0gnY,285909,286815,"Oh,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,286815,287648,(beep)
kW5X4dU0gnY,287648,290500,"I forgot to explain why we're using a GTX Titan X,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,290500,292400,because that's the last Nvidia card
kW5X4dU0gnY,292400,294470,that still included analog outputs.
kW5X4dU0gnY,294470,295620,That's why you chose it right.
kW5X4dU0gnY,295620,296710,Is there anything after that?
kW5X4dU0gnY,296710,298007,"- [Adam] No, that's the best card."
kW5X4dU0gnY,298007,299250,- Crazy.
kW5X4dU0gnY,299250,303070,This is the best CRT gaming setup you can have.
kW5X4dU0gnY,303070,305450,Can you do DP to VGA active conversion?
kW5X4dU0gnY,305450,306283,Probably. Right.
kW5X4dU0gnY,306283,307116,- Okay.
kW5X4dU0gnY,307116,307949,That was interesting.
kW5X4dU0gnY,307949,308782,Is that I looked
kW5X4dU0gnY,308782,311830,for like a good way to try to switch to analog.
kW5X4dU0gnY,311830,313069,I'm not sure if there really is one
kW5X4dU0gnY,313070,314656,that actually allows you to access all
kW5X4dU0gnY,314656,315890,of the settings in here.
kW5X4dU0gnY,315890,317645,Cause if you're just do like a plug and adapter.
kW5X4dU0gnY,317645,319270,You can only do 60 Hertz.
kW5X4dU0gnY,319270,320780,You're limited by like the HDMI spec
kW5X4dU0gnY,320780,321872,or whatever.
kW5X4dU0gnY,321872,323160,- Pooh.
kW5X4dU0gnY,323160,324290,- [David] Hey that's a good tech tip.
kW5X4dU0gnY,324290,325123,- I love it.
kW5X4dU0gnY,325123,326500,"Well, if it's on the wrong monitor"
kW5X4dU0gnY,326500,327968,"windows shift arrow key,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,327968,329270,"and you could, whoops"
kW5X4dU0gnY,329270,332400,you can move it around between the monitors.
kW5X4dU0gnY,332400,333233,Amazing.
kW5X4dU0gnY,333233,334240,Adam just tech tipped me.
kW5X4dU0gnY,334240,335270,We have to kind of fool around
kW5X4dU0gnY,335270,336419,with all displays connected
kW5X4dU0gnY,336420,337960,because if this one turns off
kW5X4dU0gnY,337960,340660,it takes 45 minutes to warm up.
kW5X4dU0gnY,340660,341990,- We were gonna check the refresh rate you.
kW5X4dU0gnY,341990,342823,- Yes.
kW5X4dU0gnY,342823,344030,- Currently it's running.
kW5X4dU0gnY,344030,345639,"- 300 Hz,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,345640,347420,is that like a G sync limitation or something?
kW5X4dU0gnY,347420,348253,What is that?
kW5X4dU0gnY,348253,350900,"Oh, you know what it probably is."
kW5X4dU0gnY,350900,353690,This is a Titan X we're running DP. 1.2.
kW5X4dU0gnY,353690,354523,- [Adam] Yeah.
kW5X4dU0gnY,356070,357420,- Can't have the best of all worlds.
kW5X4dU0gnY,357420,358253,That's okay.
kW5X4dU0gnY,358253,359086,We'll settle for 300.
kW5X4dU0gnY,359086,359919,Really?
kW5X4dU0gnY,359919,360820,What we're gonna be looking at here
kW5X4dU0gnY,360820,363500,is brightness which is obviously
kW5X4dU0gnY,363500,365110,into completely different leagues.
kW5X4dU0gnY,365110,368400,"And of course, image persistence."
kW5X4dU0gnY,368400,369591,Now here's something I didn't miss.
kW5X4dU0gnY,369592,371920,The phosphor layer is actually
kW5X4dU0gnY,371920,374840,like this far behind the front pane of glass.
kW5X4dU0gnY,374840,376701,So you kind of have this perception
kW5X4dU0gnY,376701,379949,that you're looking through a window at your monitor
kW5X4dU0gnY,379950,382460,as opposed to just at your monitor.
kW5X4dU0gnY,382460,384528,It's like your monitor sitting in a shadow box.
kW5X4dU0gnY,384528,389528,"the slight blur of having round phosphor,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,389640,392310,light emission rather than square pixels
kW5X4dU0gnY,392310,394833,you really don't need any aliasing at all.
kW5X4dU0gnY,395880,400760,It looks so clean
kW5X4dU0gnY,400760,401810,- [Adam] Flick around
kW5X4dU0gnY,403220,404520,(beep)
kW5X4dU0gnY,404520,405940,- This thing is crazy.
kW5X4dU0gnY,405940,408123,Why do they not still make these things?
kW5X4dU0gnY,409000,410010,Does it ever look good?
kW5X4dU0gnY,410010,413000,"I mean, we probably had to reduce our shutter speed"
kW5X4dU0gnY,413000,414080,so much that you're not
kW5X4dU0gnY,414080,416501,even getting - The sharpness
kW5X4dU0gnY,416502,418780,The sense of how sharp and crisp it is.
kW5X4dU0gnY,418780,421110,The motion is just flawless though.
kW5X4dU0gnY,421110,422560,Another thing that's really cool
kW5X4dU0gnY,422560,423986,is subtle gradients.
kW5X4dU0gnY,423986,427237,Like this cloudy sky to the clear blue sky up here
kW5X4dU0gnY,427237,429864,you don't get any of that blocking
kW5X4dU0gnY,429864,434010,or banding that you would potentially see on an LCD.
kW5X4dU0gnY,434010,436530,- There's a Twitter account that has like side
kW5X4dU0gnY,436530,438400,by side comparisons of 2D sprites
kW5X4dU0gnY,438400,439470,from the 16 bit era.
kW5X4dU0gnY,439470,442730,And it'll show them on a like crisp LCD display
kW5X4dU0gnY,442730,445374,as well as on like a cheaper CRT.
kW5X4dU0gnY,445374,447383,And it makes a huge difference
kW5X4dU0gnY,447383,448510,in how things look.
kW5X4dU0gnY,448510,450260,Like they have a one shot of Dracula
kW5X4dU0gnY,450260,451860,from Castlevania on an LCD.
kW5X4dU0gnY,451860,453741,"He has these tiny little beardie, little red eyes"
kW5X4dU0gnY,453742,455844,"but when you put it on a CRT,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,455844,458009,they are like natural kind of blur
kW5X4dU0gnY,458010,460130,makes it fit up the whole space in his eyes.
kW5X4dU0gnY,460130,461524,And it looks so much more painterly
kW5X4dU0gnY,461524,464090,and like it's crazy.
kW5X4dU0gnY,464090,465130,- [Adam] Windows shift arrow key over
kW5X4dU0gnY,465130,465963,to the other monitor.
kW5X4dU0gnY,465963,466796,- Yeah is that gonna work?
kW5X4dU0gnY,466796,467629,- [Adam] Yeah.
kW5X4dU0gnY,467629,468675,- Was I just imagining how much better it
kW5X4dU0gnY,468675,472009,looked going back to 10 ADP definitely sucks.
kW5X4dU0gnY,472010,474530,Although fun fact actually driving that thing
kW5X4dU0gnY,474530,475780,at the rated resolution back
kW5X4dU0gnY,475780,478740,when it came out basically impossible.
kW5X4dU0gnY,478740,481557,And it's still doesn't look as clean.
kW5X4dU0gnY,481558,482520,The additional brightness
kW5X4dU0gnY,482520,484039,is definitely a plus though.
kW5X4dU0gnY,484040,485870,And guys LCDs have improved a lot
kW5X4dU0gnY,485870,487804,"to the point where under normal circumstances,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,487804,490250,I would be whipping the mouse around on this thing
kW5X4dU0gnY,490250,491960,going man LCDs have gotten great
kW5X4dU0gnY,491960,494306,"for image persistence,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,494306,498278,but even this is not quite there.
kW5X4dU0gnY,498278,500910,I would choose the LCD.
kW5X4dU0gnY,500910,501870,- [Adam] What? why
kW5X4dU0gnY,501870,503780,- I've grown very accustomed to this level
kW5X4dU0gnY,503780,505350,of smoothness of animation
kW5X4dU0gnY,505350,507220,and the response time difference
kW5X4dU0gnY,507220,511803,at my level of play is just not enough to matter.
kW5X4dU0gnY,512890,514039,- [Adam] Do you think you can feel a difference
kW5X4dU0gnY,514039,515050,between this and the monitor
kW5X4dU0gnY,515050,517159,or is that all just that's you wouldn't know?
kW5X4dU0gnY,517159,519081,- I doubt most humans would feel a difference.
kW5X4dU0gnY,519081,520390,There is win.
kW5X4dU0gnY,520390,521669,I didn't even see an opponent.
kW5X4dU0gnY,521669,522599,(Adam chuckles)
kW5X4dU0gnY,522599,525470,And immediately upon switching to the QD OLED
kW5X4dU0gnY,525470,528170,this is using Samsung's latest panel technology
kW5X4dU0gnY,528170,529620,in this alien wear monitor.
kW5X4dU0gnY,529620,531160,The last thing I said was a big fat lie
kW5X4dU0gnY,531160,533360,because no I would definitely
kW5X4dU0gnY,533360,534644,go with this man that brightness
kW5X4dU0gnY,534645,537324,that contrast that pop.
kW5X4dU0gnY,537324,540240,OLED is a super cool technology
kW5X4dU0gnY,540240,541430,because it marries some
kW5X4dU0gnY,541430,544760,of the biggest advantages of both CRT and LCD.
kW5X4dU0gnY,544760,546030,One of the big problems
kW5X4dU0gnY,546030,549770,with early LCDs in particular was awful black levels.
kW5X4dU0gnY,549770,553290,"While with OLED, you can turn the pixels off entirely"
kW5X4dU0gnY,553290,556784,just like a CRT where you just don't eliminate that section.
kW5X4dU0gnY,556784,557617,No.
kW5X4dU0gnY,557617,558902,How I miss crap.
kW5X4dU0gnY,558902,560829,That sucked.
kW5X4dU0gnY,560830,562080,Another big advantage is
kW5X4dU0gnY,562080,563840,that due to the nature of OLED displays
kW5X4dU0gnY,563840,566860,the pixel response time is near instantaneous.
kW5X4dU0gnY,566860,569549,So you get that excellent persistence of the image
kW5X4dU0gnY,569549,572210,even when you're moving around rapidly like this.
kW5X4dU0gnY,572210,573950,Although I do have to note
kW5X4dU0gnY,573950,575740,"that without black frame insertion,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,575740,577389,"it's not quite the same, is it?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,577389,578470,Of course
kW5X4dU0gnY,578470,581019,that's not to say OLED doesn't have its advantages.
kW5X4dU0gnY,581020,583920,You probably noticed it's quite a lot brighter
kW5X4dU0gnY,583920,584990,than our CRT.
kW5X4dU0gnY,584990,586860,"Well, that's for a couple of reasons."
kW5X4dU0gnY,586860,589640,One is that this used to be rated
kW5X4dU0gnY,589640,592510,for 125 nits of peak luminance.
kW5X4dU0gnY,592510,595530,"And it has aged down to mare 69,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,595530,598290,"which is not as nice as it might sound,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,598290,600878,but turn off the lights.
kW5X4dU0gnY,600879,602380,- [Adam] Uh.
kW5X4dU0gnY,602380,603310,"Well, how do I do that?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,603310,605272,- So now's all gross because the blue phosphorus
kW5X4dU0gnY,605272,607279,have probably worn out a little bit more.
kW5X4dU0gnY,607280,608443,So after calibration.
kW5X4dU0gnY,608443,609276,- Wooh.
kW5X4dU0gnY,610230,614410,The thing about luminance is that it's all relative
kW5X4dU0gnY,614410,615922,to the dilation of your pupil.
kW5X4dU0gnY,615922,619723,That's why the standard for theater level HDR
kW5X4dU0gnY,619723,622941,is what like 80 nits or something like that.
kW5X4dU0gnY,622941,623774,- [Adam] It's not a lot.
kW5X4dU0gnY,623774,625180,- In a light controlled environment.
kW5X4dU0gnY,625180,626674,You don't need a ton of luminance.
kW5X4dU0gnY,626674,627810,Wow.
kW5X4dU0gnY,627810,630630,Has that never been more clear?
kW5X4dU0gnY,630630,632220,How am I supposed to decide?
kW5X4dU0gnY,632220,634060,"See, I could never afford this kind of thing"
kW5X4dU0gnY,634060,636260,"back when I was a gamer teenager,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,636260,637910,this is what..
kW5X4dU0gnY,637910,638743,- [David] I have something.
kW5X4dU0gnY,638743,640441,If you're still struggling to make a decision.
kW5X4dU0gnY,640442,642830,"- Oh, see, that's the thing."
kW5X4dU0gnY,642830,643780,All right.
kW5X4dU0gnY,643780,648500,OLED and CRTs share a lot of the same advantages
kW5X4dU0gnY,648500,653393,but an OLED will never draw in scan lines.
kW5X4dU0gnY,654560,659560,It is absolutely mind blowing how immediately
kW5X4dU0gnY,659980,662649,better a retro game that was designed
kW5X4dU0gnY,662650,665000,for a display with scan lines looks
kW5X4dU0gnY,665000,666380,when you fire it up
kW5X4dU0gnY,666380,669172,how did this lose to the PlayStation?
kW5X4dU0gnY,669172,672105,"Oh, look at that grinding maybe"
kW5X4dU0gnY,672105,674540,But it's been so long
kW5X4dU0gnY,674540,677792,since I've seen retro content on a proper display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,677792,680149,I forgot how good it looked.
kW5X4dU0gnY,680150,685150,There is no way that I would guess 4ADI.
kW5X4dU0gnY,685350,689230,4 ADI is half the vertical resolution
kW5X4dU0gnY,689230,690970,of 4 ADP theoretically.
kW5X4dU0gnY,690970,692629,Right? Cause they're interlaced.
kW5X4dU0gnY,692630,693860,"I mean, there's some trickery"
kW5X4dU0gnY,693860,695019,so that it doesn't look like it.
kW5X4dU0gnY,695020,697043,And that's exactly what we're seeing here.
kW5X4dU0gnY,697043,698590,- [Adam] Look at the cobblestone.
kW5X4dU0gnY,698590,700230,Like look at how good that texture looks.
kW5X4dU0gnY,700230,701269,"- I know, right?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,701270,705420,"Like this brick obviously by modern standards, right?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,705420,707709,This brick is not that amazing.
kW5X4dU0gnY,707710,711270,But with proper scan lines in your display
kW5X4dU0gnY,711270,713440,which is something that you can't really
kW5X4dU0gnY,713440,715660,"replicate on modern hardware,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,715660,716493,fake scan lines are a thing.
kW5X4dU0gnY,716493,719750,You can buy adapters that will sit in
kW5X4dU0gnY,719750,721830,between your retro console and a modern display
kW5X4dU0gnY,721830,725359,and will kind of mostly add the effect of scan lines
kW5X4dU0gnY,725359,727190,or what you can do is you can run it
kW5X4dU0gnY,727190,729294,in emulator and many emulator support
kW5X4dU0gnY,729294,732440,fake scan lines to get more of that retro look.
kW5X4dU0gnY,732440,734930,"But boy, is it ever not quite the same men in a dark room?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,734930,737380,And here's another thing that's really incredible.
kW5X4dU0gnY,737380,739350,"The dreamcast outputs at 4 ADI,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,739350,740183,like I mentioned
kW5X4dU0gnY,740183,742350,but this isn't a 4 ADI display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,742350,745889,"It runs at 2304 by 1440, 80 Hertz."
kW5X4dU0gnY,745890,749040,CRTs don't have a native resolution.
kW5X4dU0gnY,749040,753050,You see LCDs and OLEDs have physical pixels
kW5X4dU0gnY,753050,754880,that cannot be relocated.
kW5X4dU0gnY,754880,756400,So when you run them at anything
kW5X4dU0gnY,756400,758200,"other than the resolution,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,758200,760110,"the number of actual pixels,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,760110,761459,it's more of a pixel count
kW5X4dU0gnY,761460,762780,than a resolution really.
kW5X4dU0gnY,762780,764970,They look blurry or they have artifacts.
kW5X4dU0gnY,764970,769013,CRTs you can put in any input within their supported range
kW5X4dU0gnY,769013,771610,and they will run it natively.
kW5X4dU0gnY,771610,774769,So there's no drawback to using a console
kW5X4dU0gnY,774770,776620,versus a computer with this thing.
kW5X4dU0gnY,776620,778460,It'll just look flip and awesome.
kW5X4dU0gnY,778460,779470,No matter what.
kW5X4dU0gnY,779470,780832,"Oh, and another cool thing is that the limitation"
kW5X4dU0gnY,780832,784060,of what resolution or what refresh rate
kW5X4dU0gnY,784060,786260,you can run comes down to the speed
kW5X4dU0gnY,786260,788240,with which the gun can go back and forth.
kW5X4dU0gnY,788240,790154,So you could lower your resolution
kW5X4dU0gnY,790155,792010,and up your refresh rate
kW5X4dU0gnY,792010,793057,or lower your refresh rate
kW5X4dU0gnY,793057,795170,and increase serve resolution.
kW5X4dU0gnY,795170,796540,The choice is yours.
kW5X4dU0gnY,796540,797440,Within reason.
kW5X4dU0gnY,797440,800110,To compare our native image quality with an LCD.
kW5X4dU0gnY,800110,801834,We actually had to go find an older one
kW5X4dU0gnY,801834,804230,that still has a VGA input.
kW5X4dU0gnY,804230,805566,And it should be noted that depending
kW5X4dU0gnY,805567,808417,"on the scaler built into the panel,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,808417,812670,that VGA input could behave very very differently.
kW5X4dU0gnY,812670,815480,This particular BenQ was a fair high end display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,815480,817148,Wow does that ever look like dog crap?
kW5X4dU0gnY,817148,820090,The craziest part of how much worse
kW5X4dU0gnY,820090,822074,this looks to the eye is that
kW5X4dU0gnY,822074,825565,this CRT for low res games like this
kW5X4dU0gnY,825565,829660,actually isn't necessarily your best case scenario.
kW5X4dU0gnY,829660,831030,Having your pixel points
kW5X4dU0gnY,831031,834190,"and not quite a pixel, more of a dot"
kW5X4dU0gnY,834190,835260,having your dot.
kW5X4dU0gnY,835260,837936,So pinpoint accurate actually takes away some
kW5X4dU0gnY,837936,842290,of the softness that low resolution consoles benefited from.
kW5X4dU0gnY,842290,844459,It was kind of a natural anti aliasing.
kW5X4dU0gnY,844460,847150,"So if we had a CRT TV,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,847150,849310,we might even be having a better experience.
kW5X4dU0gnY,849310,852700,Look at what this brick looks like in comparison.
kW5X4dU0gnY,852700,855140,It looks like trash.
kW5X4dU0gnY,855140,856500,"Okay, let's go back."
kW5X4dU0gnY,856500,858540,Let's go back to the CRT way better.
kW5X4dU0gnY,858540,860168,Like it even looks more 3D.
kW5X4dU0gnY,860168,863020,"Do you guys see how, like, it just has more"
kW5X4dU0gnY,863020,863980,of a 3D pot.
kW5X4dU0gnY,863980,867170,"The color, it doesn't shift at all."
kW5X4dU0gnY,867170,868597,I forgot.
kW5X4dU0gnY,868597,869430,- [David] Wow.
kW5X4dU0gnY,869430,871399,- It's absolutely perfect.
kW5X4dU0gnY,871400,873500,One of the things that makes this particular set
kW5X4dU0gnY,873500,875700,so accurate is that it uses the technology
kW5X4dU0gnY,875700,877500,that Sony developed in the sixties
kW5X4dU0gnY,877500,879050,that they called Trinitron
kW5X4dU0gnY,879050,881011,to improve the video quality of the televisions.
kW5X4dU0gnY,881011,882730,When electron guns were developed
kW5X4dU0gnY,882730,884010,they weren't entirely accurate.
kW5X4dU0gnY,884010,886075,And often electrons would stray
kW5X4dU0gnY,886075,888240,from their intended path causing them to
kW5X4dU0gnY,888240,890970,activate other unintended phosphorus.
kW5X4dU0gnY,890970,892936,It wasn't a big issue with black and white televisions
kW5X4dU0gnY,892937,894694,but once colors got involved
kW5X4dU0gnY,894694,897269,stray electrons hitting nearby phosphorus
kW5X4dU0gnY,897270,899340,would unacceptably distort the image
kW5X4dU0gnY,899340,901472,with unintended colors and fuzziness.
kW5X4dU0gnY,901472,905269,To solve this RCA developed the shadow mask
kW5X4dU0gnY,905270,907360,a metal sheet full of tiny holes
kW5X4dU0gnY,907360,909079,that would block stray electrons
kW5X4dU0gnY,909080,910400,from hitting the wrong phosphorus.
kW5X4dU0gnY,910400,911750,But the downside to this
kW5X4dU0gnY,911750,913754,was it greatly reduced display brightness
kW5X4dU0gnY,913754,915377,because the metal panel blocked
kW5X4dU0gnY,915377,916680,a lot of the energy.
kW5X4dU0gnY,916680,919130,The Trinitron though uses an aperture grill
kW5X4dU0gnY,919130,921530,which is instead made up of vertical slits.
kW5X4dU0gnY,921530,923750,This was accompanied by a change in the arrangement
kW5X4dU0gnY,923750,925131,of electron guns from a triangle
kW5X4dU0gnY,925131,926730,to a straight line.
kW5X4dU0gnY,926730,928089,And it allows much more
kW5X4dU0gnY,928090,929860,of the energy to make it to the screen.
kW5X4dU0gnY,929860,931450,"And thus, a brighter display."
kW5X4dU0gnY,931450,933660,Sony actually won an Emmy for this technology.
kW5X4dU0gnY,933660,936779,So apple isn't the only Emmy award winning tech company
kW5X4dU0gnY,936780,938650,the disadvantage of aperture grill.
kW5X4dU0gnY,938650,940730,So my old view Sonic P 95F plus
kW5X4dU0gnY,940730,942269,was an aperture grill display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,942270,943515,Are we connected to the computer still?
kW5X4dU0gnY,943515,944410,(indistinct)
kW5X4dU0gnY,944410,945761,Okay let's switch over.
kW5X4dU0gnY,945761,948029,(bright upbeat music)
kW5X4dU0gnY,948030,949210,"And there's one up here as well,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,949210,950920,right there.
kW5X4dU0gnY,950920,953740,Those lines there are a visible element
kW5X4dU0gnY,953740,955050,of the aperture grill
kW5X4dU0gnY,955050,956870,"and they're noticeable enough that Adam,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,956870,958270,"when this thing arrived, came to me,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,958270,959103,he is like
kW5X4dU0gnY,959103,961190,"Linus I think you spent $3,000"
kW5X4dU0gnY,961190,963430,on a monitor with visible defects on it.
kW5X4dU0gnY,963430,965190,Actually they're completely normal.
kW5X4dU0gnY,965190,966730,And I can tell you from experience
kW5X4dU0gnY,966730,968500,daily driving and aperture grill monitor
kW5X4dU0gnY,968500,970400,that you completely forget about them.
kW5X4dU0gnY,970400,972770,After the first couple of hours.
kW5X4dU0gnY,972770,975670,The LTT store screwdriver has a super strong magnet
kW5X4dU0gnY,975670,977436,in it and a magnetic bit.
kW5X4dU0gnY,977436,979888,And the funny thing about electrons
kW5X4dU0gnY,979888,983980,"is they interact with magnetic fields, right?"
kW5X4dU0gnY,983980,986263,So woo.
kW5X4dU0gnY,987520,989080,What's going on here?
kW5X4dU0gnY,989080,990170,It's about actually all you're doing
kW5X4dU0gnY,990170,992560,is just taking the electron beams
kW5X4dU0gnY,992560,993910,and deflecting them.
kW5X4dU0gnY,993910,994743,So I'm supposed to talk
kW5X4dU0gnY,994743,997579,to you guys about why people don't buy these.
kW5X4dU0gnY,997580,999200,One obvious one is price.
kW5X4dU0gnY,999200,1001462,"Although you can find TVs, especially"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1001462,1003190,if they're not in great condition
kW5X4dU0gnY,1003190,1004890,for significantly cheaper than
kW5X4dU0gnY,1004890,1005950,what we paid for this.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1005950,1007150,The issue is that finding one
kW5X4dU0gnY,1007150,1008640,in good shape is getting more
kW5X4dU0gnY,1008640,1009630,and more challenging.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1009630,1012331,And as that becomes more and more true
kW5X4dU0gnY,1012331,1014154,the cost are only gonna go up.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1014154,1016464,"Even this one, which we paid a lot for"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1016465,1018610,suffers from degraded phosphorus
kW5X4dU0gnY,1018610,1020480,and some nicks in the anti glare coating.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1020480,1021800,Another big one is cost.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1021800,1023019,"Even if the price isn't high,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1023020,1025220,transporting these things can be a nightmare.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1025220,1026809,How much does it cost to ship one of these?
kW5X4dU0gnY,1026810,1028433,"Especially without the original packaging,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1028433,1031949,it was cheaper for me to pay an employee for 10 hours
kW5X4dU0gnY,1031949,1034029,of driving and reimburse their mileage
kW5X4dU0gnY,1034030,1035370,than to ship it via mail.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1035370,1036640,And then there's voluminous.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1036640,1039079,CRTs just don't get as bright
kW5X4dU0gnY,1039079,1041819,"and as they're used, it only gets worse."
kW5X4dU0gnY,1041819,1042949,And so unlike a projector
kW5X4dU0gnY,1042949,1044549,there's no way to change out the lamp.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1044550,1045400,It's not a lamp.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1045400,1046870,It's an electron gun.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1046870,1048059,After years of service
kW5X4dU0gnY,1048060,1050660,this thing just ain't gonna look the way
kW5X4dU0gnY,1050660,1051493,that it used to.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1051493,1053804,So what's the answer in my opinion
kW5X4dU0gnY,1053804,1055602,modern TVs between OLED
kW5X4dU0gnY,1055603,1058380,and particularly QD OLED
kW5X4dU0gnY,1058380,1060076,which is in TV's now
kW5X4dU0gnY,1060076,1062270,and on the horizon for monitors.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1062270,1064650,We no longer have to deal with the shortcomings of LCDs.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1064650,1067575,And while they do have some drawbacks themselves
kW5X4dU0gnY,1067575,1069987,the biggest one which is burning
kW5X4dU0gnY,1069988,1073200,is actually shared with CRTs.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1073200,1074289,There's also the fact that they run
kW5X4dU0gnY,1074290,1075380,at a fixed resolution
kW5X4dU0gnY,1075380,1076870,but from my personal experience
kW5X4dU0gnY,1076870,1078620,"as we've gone to 4k and beyond,"
kW5X4dU0gnY,1078620,1080730,it's become far less of an issue
kW5X4dU0gnY,1080730,1082108,because the pixel density is so high
kW5X4dU0gnY,1082108,1085420,that especially from couch distance.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1085420,1087400,It doesn't make that much of a difference.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1087400,1088760,But if you want the ultimate
kW5X4dU0gnY,1088760,1090578,tracking down a high quality CRT
kW5X4dU0gnY,1090578,1092140,might be worth it for you.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1092140,1093020,For the rest of you.

kW5X4dU0gnY,1146120,1148450,which was actually a rear projection display.
kW5X4dU0gnY,1148450,1149283,We still have it.
