8pnHUuOakf8,6000,14000,Nowadays only flagship phones have these kind of small boxes But this F23 5G
8pnHUuOakf8,15000,32000,Which is under Rs 20K comes with a small box. Today I'll be doing the unboxing of this
8pnHUuOakf8,33000,35000,Phone and will give you my first impressions
8pnHUuOakf8,42000,63000,"Make sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel. Sim card tool, it has a USB Type C"
8pnHUuOakf8,64000,86000,To Type C cable. There's no case or adapter. It feels like glass. It has a minimalistic traditional design
8pnHUuOakf8,108000,117000,Coming back from Barcelona even if the phones are heavy I feel they are light. The frame is plastic.
8pnHUuOakf8,118000,133000,It has gorilla glass 5 protection. It has a dedicated SD card slot.
8pnHUuOakf8,147000,153000,One interesting thing about the display is that it is one of the few phones under Rs 20K
8pnHUuOakf8,154000,165000,"Which has a TFT display and 120Hz fast refresh rate.The screen is 6.6""."
8pnHUuOakf8,169000,176000,The screen is quite bright indoors but if there's direct sunlight then it might be an issue.
8pnHUuOakf8,181000,189000,It comes on SD 750G which is a 5G processor. This is also a tried and tested 8nm processor.
8pnHUuOakf8,190000,204000,It has 2 variants 4GB+128GB & 6GB+128GB. The storage type is UFS 2.2 with LPDDR4x RAM. 
8pnHUuOakf8,205000,210000,The battery is 5000mAh with 25W fast charging. It also has 6GB virtual RAM.
8pnHUuOakf8,228000,234000,After S22 it is the first phone which comes on 4.1 UI which is based on Android 12
8pnHUuOakf8,258000,263000,Generally the 750G processor has an antutu score of about 3.5L but this came around 2.60L
8pnHUuOakf8,267000,283000,It might be because of the throttling issue that we're facing. You can play BGMI at very high
8pnHUuOakf8,284000,299000,And Ultra settings and COD on very high settings. Even though it is a TFT screen it does not compromise in performance.
8pnHUuOakf8,321000,331000," It supports 12 bands, has a carrier aggregation, also supports WiFi calling, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC"
8pnHUuOakf8,335000,341000,So all the connectivity options you need are present. The side-mounted fingerprint
8pnHUuOakf8,342000,344000,Sensor works well and so does the face unlock
8pnHUuOakf8,351000,357000,It has mono speakers but stereo speakers would've been better3
8pnHUuOakf8,359000,361000,The video viewing experience will be good.
8pnHUuOakf8,365000,370000,It supports Camera2API with widevine L1
8pnHUuOakf8,372000,378000,It has 3.5MM jack and FM radio though there's no IP rating and SAR value is within limits
8pnHUuOakf8,380000,390000,"The camera setup is 50MP+8MP+2MP. And for the first time the 2MP macro sensor is usable,"
8pnHUuOakf8,391000,397000,"Generally the 2MP cameras are not that good,but there's improvement in this one."
8pnHUuOakf8,398000,405000,"The FOV of the 8MP camera is 123Â° photos under normal conditions come out pretty decent,"
8pnHUuOakf8,406000,414000,But a bit soft in low light. Here are some samples of the primary camera.
8pnHUuOakf8,422000,431000,The 8MP selfie sensor is decent. But there are a lot of features in the camera app.
8pnHUuOakf8,432000,439000,The filters that are on Snapchat you get it on the camera app itself. It also has super slow motion
8pnHUuOakf8,444000,454000, One thing about the camera is that there's a bit of color shift when you click photos
8pnHUuOakf8,460000,466000,Good things were the 12 bands supporting but the TFT was a negative.
8pnHUuOakf8,469000,476000,The gaming experience would be great. The camera setup is decent.
8pnHUuOakf8,480000,493000,Overall it's a balanced phone. One more good thing is that you'll get updates for 3-4 years
8pnHUuOakf8,506000,509000,"If you have any questions about the phone drop them in the comment section,"
8pnHUuOakf8,510000,513000,That's all for this video until the next time Keep Trakin and Stay Safe
