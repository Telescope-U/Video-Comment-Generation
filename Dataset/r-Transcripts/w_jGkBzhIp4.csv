w_jGkBzhIp4,11180,12799,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,12799,14559,well welcome to a new harry's garage
w_jGkBzhIp4,14559,16320,video and this one i'm really excited
w_jGkBzhIp4,16320,20000,about because i have the lotus emira
w_jGkBzhIp4,20000,21920,first edition in the garage and i've had
w_jGkBzhIp4,21920,23920,it for a few days the first chance to
w_jGkBzhIp4,23920,26720,drive this car that i've saw up at
w_jGkBzhIp4,26720,29199,heffel for the world reveal on the 6th
w_jGkBzhIp4,29199,33120,of july last year so just 11 months ago
w_jGkBzhIp4,33120,35360,and here it is in the garage
w_jGkBzhIp4,35360,36880,now as i'm sure you're aware there are
w_jGkBzhIp4,36880,39680,two versions of a mirror there's the i4
w_jGkBzhIp4,39680,41920,4-cylinder amg engine one with dual
w_jGkBzhIp4,41920,44800,clutch transmission all the v6 which has
w_jGkBzhIp4,44800,47920,either a manual transmission or auto
w_jGkBzhIp4,47920,50000,six-speed gearbox you choose which one
w_jGkBzhIp4,50000,54079,you want this one is the v6 manual with
w_jGkBzhIp4,54079,57120,sport packs so sport suspension there is
w_jGkBzhIp4,57120,58960,a tour pack as well
w_jGkBzhIp4,58960,60640,and we'll come to that later because i
w_jGkBzhIp4,60640,63280,have also had a chance to drive the tour
w_jGkBzhIp4,63280,65040,back to back with this sport edition on
w_jGkBzhIp4,65040,66640,the same bitter road
w_jGkBzhIp4,66640,70840,this one the v6 is priced at 75
w_jGkBzhIp4,70840,75280,995 the amg four-cylinder engine version
w_jGkBzhIp4,75280,77200,isn't out yet we haven't had a chance to
w_jGkBzhIp4,77200,79520,drive it but you can order it and the
w_jGkBzhIp4,79520,82960,first edition of that one is 71 995 i
w_jGkBzhIp4,82960,85119,looked at the website just before coming
w_jGkBzhIp4,85119,87439,up here and they're still saying
w_jGkBzhIp4,87439,89920,the four-cylinder version of the amira
w_jGkBzhIp4,89920,93200,starts at 59.995
w_jGkBzhIp4,93200,94799,we haven't seen that it won't be
w_jGkBzhIp4,94799,97360,available until 2023 but that is an
w_jGkBzhIp4,97360,100320,amazing start price went for this card i
w_jGkBzhIp4,100320,102159,think looks terrific
w_jGkBzhIp4,102159,103759,now let's go and have a closer look and
w_jGkBzhIp4,103759,106159,see all the details on this new lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,106159,107600,i'm just going to discuss the size of
w_jGkBzhIp4,107600,109119,this car just i think it's important to
w_jGkBzhIp4,109119,111119,get the position of where this car sits
w_jGkBzhIp4,111119,113680,in the market it's a bigger car than the
w_jGkBzhIp4,113680,117119,alpine a110 for example but it's almost
w_jGkBzhIp4,117119,119759,identical in a number of key
w_jGkBzhIp4,119759,122799,areas to the porsche cayman gts four
w_jGkBzhIp4,122799,125840,liter which i think is its closest rival
w_jGkBzhIp4,125840,128800,the one area where it's bigger is wider
w_jGkBzhIp4,128800,132000,tracked it's it's both wider in body and
w_jGkBzhIp4,132000,134800,in track so this is 2047 width as
w_jGkBzhIp4,134800,136720,against 1994
w_jGkBzhIp4,136720,139360,for the cayman gts but it's a good
w_jGkBzhIp4,139360,141120,looking car
w_jGkBzhIp4,141120,143280,this is the new look of lotus as these
w_jGkBzhIp4,143280,146319,strange cutouts here it all feeds a
w_jGkBzhIp4,146319,148319,radiator that you can see down there
w_jGkBzhIp4,148319,150640,it's angled back and then it vents
w_jGkBzhIp4,150640,151840,through here
w_jGkBzhIp4,151840,153440,you think you could open this but you
w_jGkBzhIp4,153440,155280,can't you there's no access to the front
w_jGkBzhIp4,155280,158720,there then if you come round the side
w_jGkBzhIp4,158720,162480,this car actually sits on 20 inch wheels
w_jGkBzhIp4,162480,165440,and this car being a sport pack has the
w_jGkBzhIp4,165440,168640,optional michelin cup 2 tyres the other
w_jGkBzhIp4,168640,172000,tower available is a good year f1 tyre
w_jGkBzhIp4,172000,174480,and i've also driven it this car on the
w_jGkBzhIp4,174480,176560,goodyears as well as these michelin cup
w_jGkBzhIp4,176560,178800,ii this is the most extreme version if
w_jGkBzhIp4,178800,181280,you like this example here
w_jGkBzhIp4,181280,184239,come down now when you spec your car you
w_jGkBzhIp4,184239,186319,can choose whether i have a black roof
w_jGkBzhIp4,186319,188560,up here black rails black roof or body
w_jGkBzhIp4,188560,191599,color and the same with lower pack that
w_jGkBzhIp4,191599,194159,black vent here
w_jGkBzhIp4,194159,195920,when i actually looked at it it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,195920,198400,actually venting into the back wheel
w_jGkBzhIp4,198400,200159,and the other thing to note i always
w_jGkBzhIp4,200159,202400,think on lotus you might think oh why
w_jGkBzhIp4,202400,204879,don't they it looks sits quite high that
w_jGkBzhIp4,204879,207920,is a lotus trait they always have a lot
w_jGkBzhIp4,207920,209920,of suspension movement it's just how
w_jGkBzhIp4,209920,212400,they set the cars up so i think it's a
w_jGkBzhIp4,212400,216239,good thing for mainly road use no carbon
w_jGkBzhIp4,216239,217920,brakes available
w_jGkBzhIp4,217920,220080,at the moment on this car but super big
w_jGkBzhIp4,220080,221760,brakes and 20 inch
w_jGkBzhIp4,221760,224480,front and rear wheels fronts are tires
w_jGkBzhIp4,224480,228640,of 245 35 20 and the rears are
w_jGkBzhIp4,228640,232000,295 30 20 tiles
w_jGkBzhIp4,232000,234159,quick look inside
w_jGkBzhIp4,234159,235599,we'll see it better when we go for a
w_jGkBzhIp4,235599,238319,drive but that is the big change on this
w_jGkBzhIp4,238319,240560,car even down to the doors you never
w_jGkBzhIp4,240560,243040,even got armrests on the avora until
w_jGkBzhIp4,243040,244959,they introduced the sort of gt version
w_jGkBzhIp4,244959,247840,right at the end there was no storage
w_jGkBzhIp4,247840,250000,here i've got you know pockets there
w_jGkBzhIp4,250000,252239,i've got 12-way electric seats i've got
w_jGkBzhIp4,252239,254720,that tft screen in the middle this being
w_jGkBzhIp4,254720,256720,a manual there's very obvious gear
w_jGkBzhIp4,256720,258720,change there an all exposed mechanism
w_jGkBzhIp4,258720,262079,underneath it's completely different to
w_jGkBzhIp4,262079,265360,evora and brings lotus bang up to date
w_jGkBzhIp4,265360,266720,other things on the options i'm
w_jGkBzhIp4,266720,268400,surprised you can get privacy glass for
w_jGkBzhIp4,268400,270560,this tiny little window hardly sees any
w_jGkBzhIp4,270560,273360,point this is the baz telling you first
w_jGkBzhIp4,273360,275680,edition so the one there the mirror
w_jGkBzhIp4,275680,278160,really nice silly little detail i like
w_jGkBzhIp4,278160,281280,but if i flick the petrol cap there's no
w_jGkBzhIp4,281280,283520,actual filler thing you feel straight up
w_jGkBzhIp4,283520,285199,i don't know why more cars don't have
w_jGkBzhIp4,285199,287759,that it seems the obvious thing to do
w_jGkBzhIp4,287759,289840,come round the back though
w_jGkBzhIp4,289840,292080,and here things get really serious the
w_jGkBzhIp4,292080,294160,last ivor i had in the garage had a
w_jGkBzhIp4,294160,296560,central exhaust now it's twin exhaust is
w_jGkBzhIp4,296560,298639,a there's a hint of at least i suppose
w_jGkBzhIp4,298639,301199,the design on this thing with a venturi
w_jGkBzhIp4,301199,303600,coming up lotus across the back
w_jGkBzhIp4,303600,306160,but that wide start it just looks very
w_jGkBzhIp4,306160,308800,modern and then back here
w_jGkBzhIp4,308800,311039,you get a boot here
w_jGkBzhIp4,311039,312960,you also get quite a big space behind
w_jGkBzhIp4,312960,315600,the front seats which is really useful
w_jGkBzhIp4,315600,317280,this is actually your battery cover
w_jGkBzhIp4,317280,318880,there's a normal battery in there i
w_jGkBzhIp4,318880,320400,checked because the last divor i had in
w_jGkBzhIp4,320400,321680,had a lithium battery this is
w_jGkBzhIp4,321680,323120,conventional battery and then the
w_jGkBzhIp4,323120,326800,supercharged v6 toyota engine base and
w_jGkBzhIp4,326800,329440,lotus supercharger arm charged cooled
w_jGkBzhIp4,329440,333199,and 400 horsepower in this example 420
w_jGkBzhIp4,333199,335120,newton meters of torque weirdly if you
w_jGkBzhIp4,335120,338080,get the automatic gearbox it goes to 430
w_jGkBzhIp4,338080,340800,newton meters of torque i mean a great
w_jGkBzhIp4,340800,341840,engine
w_jGkBzhIp4,341840,344080,revs out you'll see when we drive it
w_jGkBzhIp4,344080,346000,gives this car real character this
w_jGkBzhIp4,346000,347120,engine
w_jGkBzhIp4,347120,348960,so there you go there's a quick run
w_jGkBzhIp4,348960,351120,around the car let's take it outside
w_jGkBzhIp4,351120,353360,take it for a drive now before i get in
w_jGkBzhIp4,353360,354720,there's just a couple of things i want
w_jGkBzhIp4,354720,357039,to show you one the useful storage space
w_jGkBzhIp4,357039,358639,behind the seats
w_jGkBzhIp4,358639,361199,that's dead easy to access side of the
w_jGkBzhIp4,361199,363520,seat tips down like that i can chuck
w_jGkBzhIp4,363520,365840,things back there i can put proper size
w_jGkBzhIp4,365840,368319,bags there briefcases whatever and then
w_jGkBzhIp4,368319,370479,lots of people say oh you can't get into
w_jGkBzhIp4,370479,372080,the aurora what's it like in the mirror
w_jGkBzhIp4,372080,374479,here is me getting into a mirror
w_jGkBzhIp4,374479,375680,there we are
w_jGkBzhIp4,375680,377840,what's really nice is the seat isn't a
w_jGkBzhIp4,377840,380479,torture device so there's no hard edges
w_jGkBzhIp4,380479,382720,and you get out again it is a piece of
w_jGkBzhIp4,382720,385520,cake it is a non-issue now getting in
w_jGkBzhIp4,385520,387520,and out of your new lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,387520,388319,now
w_jGkBzhIp4,388319,390319,some things just uh take in when you get
w_jGkBzhIp4,390319,392800,in here first the really modern interior
w_jGkBzhIp4,392800,395360,two the steering wheel goes up down in
w_jGkBzhIp4,395360,397120,and out all over the place and it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,397120,399360,quite critical where you have it because
w_jGkBzhIp4,399360,401919,you want to be able to see the dash
w_jGkBzhIp4,401919,404639,because the revs are along the top line
w_jGkBzhIp4,404639,406080,so you can just line it up it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,406080,407680,perfectly shaped the steering wheel for
w_jGkBzhIp4,407680,410639,that i'm going to start the car
w_jGkBzhIp4,410639,412000,because we've got a very odd day in the
w_jGkBzhIp4,412000,414319,uk it's really warm it's saying it's 30
w_jGkBzhIp4,414319,416400,degrees or 31 it's just clicked up but
w_jGkBzhIp4,416400,417680,it's not but i just want to get the air
w_jGkBzhIp4,417680,418800,conditioning
w_jGkBzhIp4,418800,420960,up and running
w_jGkBzhIp4,420960,423759,yeah modern steer wheel everything you
w_jGkBzhIp4,423759,425120,just don't think you're sitting in the
w_jGkBzhIp4,425120,426720,lotus you need the badge to tell you
w_jGkBzhIp4,426720,428080,it's been so long
w_jGkBzhIp4,428080,429919,since you've had a really up-to-date
w_jGkBzhIp4,429919,431759,interior like this storage everywhere
w_jGkBzhIp4,431759,434560,say in the doors cupholders there and
w_jGkBzhIp4,434560,436639,then there's one here as well been here
w_jGkBzhIp4,436639,438400,and i discovered the other day it's even
w_jGkBzhIp4,438400,440319,got a glove box like it's so hidden and
w_jGkBzhIp4,440319,442080,the switch is under here i didn't notice
w_jGkBzhIp4,442080,444000,it's got a sort of reasonable sized
w_jGkBzhIp4,444000,446639,glock box on the steering wheel itself
w_jGkBzhIp4,446639,448960,i've got cruise control and things here
w_jGkBzhIp4,448960,450720,and then this thing sort of controls
w_jGkBzhIp4,450720,453520,things on the dash now unfortunately i
w_jGkBzhIp4,453520,455680,hope this was going to be a 100
w_jGkBzhIp4,455680,458080,production car but it's not it's just
w_jGkBzhIp4,458080,461120,not quite full production and that's got
w_jGkBzhIp4,461120,463520,software 5.6 when it should have six so
w_jGkBzhIp4,463520,466960,i get a srs service urgent message which
w_jGkBzhIp4,466960,468319,is all a bit nonsense but i have to
w_jGkBzhIp4,468319,470240,click it and i have an airbag warning
w_jGkBzhIp4,470240,472479,light that's just part of part of it
w_jGkBzhIp4,472479,475919,pre-production etc and thinking how much
w_jGkBzhIp4,475919,477360,trouble there's been going on in the
w_jGkBzhIp4,477360,479520,world if that's the only issue that's
w_jGkBzhIp4,479520,482160,not too bad lovely vents all with little
w_jGkBzhIp4,482160,484720,with mirror on them great view out
w_jGkBzhIp4,484720,487199,you'll see oh pumping and beautiful cold
w_jGkBzhIp4,487199,490080,air in and all controllable down here
w_jGkBzhIp4,490080,491840,drive modes have come to that radio et
w_jGkBzhIp4,491840,494160,cetera it just turns on this button here
w_jGkBzhIp4,494160,496879,there it goes or off volume etc and
w_jGkBzhIp4,496879,498479,let's say the starter hides underneath
w_jGkBzhIp4,498479,500319,this red warning thing here and there's
w_jGkBzhIp4,500319,502879,a gearbox plenty of space behind engine
w_jGkBzhIp4,502879,505039,tucked away no nonsense rear seats just
w_jGkBzhIp4,505039,507280,a sort of luggage here anyway let's get
w_jGkBzhIp4,507280,509840,going first thing you notice actually
w_jGkBzhIp4,509840,512240,heavier clutch than you're expecting and
w_jGkBzhIp4,512240,515279,a sort of relatively heavy um gear chase
w_jGkBzhIp4,515279,517279,it's oh it's not heavy but it's snappy
w_jGkBzhIp4,517279,519039,it's short throw
w_jGkBzhIp4,519039,522320,but the clutch waiting is on the heavier
w_jGkBzhIp4,522320,524159,side than you might expect with a toyota
w_jGkBzhIp4,524159,526000,engine there it is locked
w_jGkBzhIp4,526000,528880,and off we go
w_jGkBzhIp4,528880,532160,first drive in the mirror finally anyway
w_jGkBzhIp4,532160,534000,i'll do my usual thing head out and
w_jGkBzhIp4,534000,535680,you'll join me in a moment on our better
w_jGkBzhIp4,535680,538680,roads
w_jGkBzhIp4,539760,543000,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,549839,552480,off we go
w_jGkBzhIp4,554720,556880,you soon get the feel that supercharged
w_jGkBzhIp4,556880,557920,power
w_jGkBzhIp4,557920,560720,three and a half liter v6 engine before
w_jGkBzhIp4,560720,563440,supercharging means it's quite grunty
w_jGkBzhIp4,563440,565839,from the off
w_jGkBzhIp4,565839,567920,i've got it in tour at the moment so
w_jGkBzhIp4,567920,569839,this is its default setting which is
w_jGkBzhIp4,569839,572800,it's quieter zone it is a little quieter
w_jGkBzhIp4,572800,575440,than i expected of the exhaust sound but
w_jGkBzhIp4,575440,577279,i said sort of good things i did measure
w_jGkBzhIp4,577279,578959,it this on this bit of road i always do
w_jGkBzhIp4,578959,582320,the test cars and it came out at 78
w_jGkBzhIp4,582320,583760,decibels
w_jGkBzhIp4,583760,585760,which is quite a lot and i have
w_jGkBzhIp4,585760,587440,something else to say on that in a
w_jGkBzhIp4,587440,590959,moment but it is on cut two tyres it is
w_jGkBzhIp4,590959,592560,the sport setting
w_jGkBzhIp4,592560,594399,and it's a lotus so it's gonna be the
w_jGkBzhIp4,594399,595920,quietest car in the world in the first
w_jGkBzhIp4,595920,597760,place and that is below
w_jGkBzhIp4,597760,600320,current porsche settings which quite
w_jGkBzhIp4,600320,603839,often in the 80 decibel mark
w_jGkBzhIp4,603839,604640,now
w_jGkBzhIp4,604640,606880,i quite also like i just had it up
w_jGkBzhIp4,606880,609360,before there we are tires
w_jGkBzhIp4,609360,611760,it's the only car i know that has
w_jGkBzhIp4,611760,614320,displays tire pressures to a hundredth
w_jGkBzhIp4,614320,617880,of a bar there's no sort of 2.1 bar it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,617880,620720,2.03 bar but i suppose that's what you
w_jGkBzhIp4,620720,624880,expect from those 2.03 and 2.08 it shows
w_jGkBzhIp4,624880,627600,how finishing they are on the detail in
w_jGkBzhIp4,627600,629360,the chassis department the dynamics
w_jGkBzhIp4,629360,632399,different departments they need to have
w_jGkBzhIp4,632399,635440,tar pressures to two decimal points
w_jGkBzhIp4,635440,637680,other things i've noticed just as i pull
w_jGkBzhIp4,637680,639200,away it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,639200,641279,you can just feel the bumps coming
w_jGkBzhIp4,641279,643839,through this is a very you know focused
w_jGkBzhIp4,643839,645519,car should we say
w_jGkBzhIp4,645519,648079,steering is just a delight super sharp i
w_jGkBzhIp4,648079,649760,mean i'm just going through
w_jGkBzhIp4,649760,652959,the moment but it's hydraulic system
w_jGkBzhIp4,652959,655120,but there is
w_jGkBzhIp4,655120,657440,immediately you know you're in something
w_jGkBzhIp4,657440,661839,that's dynamically pretty special
w_jGkBzhIp4,668320,670560,there's three modes you can go in that's
w_jGkBzhIp4,670560,672560,all accessed by these driver modes here
w_jGkBzhIp4,672560,674640,so if i touch it it brings it up
w_jGkBzhIp4,674640,676959,tor is the first one powertrain is
w_jGkBzhIp4,676959,679760,relaxed exhaust stability i'm gonna
w_jGkBzhIp4,679760,682399,choose sport and there is track beyond
w_jGkBzhIp4,682399,683680,it this is how you actually turn the
w_jGkBzhIp4,683680,685600,traction control off on that screen as
w_jGkBzhIp4,685600,686720,well
w_jGkBzhIp4,686720,689040,but key on it it doesn't actually adjust
w_jGkBzhIp4,689040,691839,the dampers the dampers are fixed
w_jGkBzhIp4,691839,693760,and the different rates depending if you
w_jGkBzhIp4,693760,696399,went for the tour uh take the tour box
w_jGkBzhIp4,696399,699120,or the sport box when you order the car
w_jGkBzhIp4,699120,700720,right here we go this is going to be the
w_jGkBzhIp4,700720,702240,squirt up here i'm actually going to go
w_jGkBzhIp4,702240,704720,down to second actually so it's quite
w_jGkBzhIp4,704720,706720,short geared and that's a really good
w_jGkBzhIp4,706720,708640,thing because you get to enjoy the revs
w_jGkBzhIp4,708640,710480,and it's an engine worth stretching so
w_jGkBzhIp4,710480,715079,here's the dealer inside here we go
w_jGkBzhIp4,724240,725440,as you would expect from the
w_jGkBzhIp4,725440,727120,supercharger
w_jGkBzhIp4,727120,729440,and it and it just builds it's one of
w_jGkBzhIp4,729440,731120,those engine that's definitely worth
w_jGkBzhIp4,731120,733760,revving out and it's lovely that it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,733760,735440,not turbocharged there isn't this
w_jGkBzhIp4,735440,737760,instant wallop of torque down below and
w_jGkBzhIp4,737760,740160,then it's just completely linear
w_jGkBzhIp4,740160,742880,building of power and torque right up to
w_jGkBzhIp4,742880,747730,the 6800 rpm cut off which is all good
w_jGkBzhIp4,747730,752868,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,758800,761279,all right let's try it away from here
w_jGkBzhIp4,761279,764839,standing start
w_jGkBzhIp4,773600,776160,just a bundle of energy now this is my
w_jGkBzhIp4,776160,777680,copper bit of road
w_jGkBzhIp4,777680,779760,and it yeah i mean it's quite busy down
w_jGkBzhIp4,779760,783360,here steering is super sharp though
w_jGkBzhIp4,783360,785440,it's not quite flashing over the bumps
w_jGkBzhIp4,785440,787600,as i would expect
w_jGkBzhIp4,787600,790399,but this is i say the sport set up with
w_jGkBzhIp4,790399,793279,those cup two tires
w_jGkBzhIp4,793279,794880,and it's actually
w_jGkBzhIp4,794880,796959,when this car first arrived a few days
w_jGkBzhIp4,796959,800800,ago i took it down this bit of road
w_jGkBzhIp4,800800,802800,and i have to say i was confused you
w_jGkBzhIp4,802800,805200,know it says lotus i was expecting to
w_jGkBzhIp4,805200,807839,have this absorption bump absorption
w_jGkBzhIp4,807839,809760,and to actually ride out these smaller
w_jGkBzhIp4,809760,812959,bumps but no it was quite aggressive it
w_jGkBzhIp4,812959,814959,is quite close to ride i'd describe it
w_jGkBzhIp4,814959,816880,to something like the gr yaris with
w_jGkBzhIp4,816880,819440,circuit pack it's not as hard as a
w_jGkBzhIp4,819440,821360,porsche gt3
w_jGkBzhIp4,821360,823839,but he's up there so i gave lotus a call
w_jGkBzhIp4,823839,825839,i said uh is this just because of the
w_jGkBzhIp4,825839,828560,cuff twos i said no it's very different
w_jGkBzhIp4,828560,831040,between touring and sport
w_jGkBzhIp4,831040,833440,and they very kindly
w_jGkBzhIp4,833440,836480,one of their dynamic guys william copman
w_jGkBzhIp4,836480,839199,jumped in the car the next morning that
w_jGkBzhIp4,839199,841360,silly o'clock arrived here around nine
w_jGkBzhIp4,841360,845199,o'clock and i had both cars here and
w_jGkBzhIp4,845199,847600,took them down this bit of road i could
w_jGkBzhIp4,847600,850560,compare the two so what i'm gonna do now
w_jGkBzhIp4,850560,853199,is we swapped over cars you're gonna
w_jGkBzhIp4,853199,856160,join me now on that exact same bit of
w_jGkBzhIp4,856160,857120,road
w_jGkBzhIp4,857120,860399,in the nevorah identical but with tall
w_jGkBzhIp4,860399,862639,pack rather than sports pack this is
w_jGkBzhIp4,862639,866040,what i discovered
w_jGkBzhIp4,869810,874590,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,880800,885000,it's completely different
w_jGkBzhIp4,885040,888079,it now floats over the bumps like i
w_jGkBzhIp4,888079,890079,expect a lotus too it's still firm it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,890079,892959,still very sporty steering is chattering
w_jGkBzhIp4,892959,894320,away
w_jGkBzhIp4,894320,896320,but i haven't got that harshness i've
w_jGkBzhIp4,896320,900480,just got this premium of the road floats
w_jGkBzhIp4,900480,903040,and i can just attack the b road without
w_jGkBzhIp4,903040,904800,any annoying sort of
w_jGkBzhIp4,904800,907839,aggressive sort of bump
w_jGkBzhIp4,907839,910560,rebound just all in the damping i'm very
w_jGkBzhIp4,910560,914639,surprised the spring rates are so close
w_jGkBzhIp4,916959,920639,look at that steering torque
w_jGkBzhIp4,920639,924240,and modern cars don't do that
w_jGkBzhIp4,924240,926639,it's amazing
w_jGkBzhIp4,926639,928020,pure lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,928020,931409,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,935170,938839,[Applause]
w_jGkBzhIp4,939600,942480,so there you go tall is a very different
w_jGkBzhIp4,942480,945680,car to sporting and to me is much more
w_jGkBzhIp4,945680,948240,what i expected from lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,948240,949920,and the other surprise it was much
w_jGkBzhIp4,949920,952240,quality it was 74 decibels on the same
w_jGkBzhIp4,952240,954160,bit of road where this car was 78 anyway
w_jGkBzhIp4,954160,956240,let's try it through here on these bumps
w_jGkBzhIp4,956240,958320,but yeah as ever
w_jGkBzhIp4,958320,960079,it's it's the amount of suspension
w_jGkBzhIp4,960079,962000,travel just completely
w_jGkBzhIp4,962000,964480,dismissed that compression there because
w_jGkBzhIp4,964480,966240,it's not sort of
w_jGkBzhIp4,966240,968399,lowered right down that turn into here
w_jGkBzhIp4,968399,971199,is just spectacular now i can't upset
w_jGkBzhIp4,971199,973759,the grip on this car
w_jGkBzhIp4,973759,975519,there's negative camber coming out of
w_jGkBzhIp4,975519,977600,that corner
w_jGkBzhIp4,977600,981440,doesn't notice it that bit is pure lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,981440,983120,but that tore
w_jGkBzhIp4,983120,986160,does add that usability i spoke to gavin
w_jGkBzhIp4,986160,988480,kershaw about it after driving the pair
w_jGkBzhIp4,988480,990079,of the cars together
w_jGkBzhIp4,990079,991199,and it was really interesting when he
w_jGkBzhIp4,991199,992560,said i said if it's what's the
w_jGkBzhIp4,992560,994240,difference between the two
w_jGkBzhIp4,994240,996880,he says the spring rates are within five
w_jGkBzhIp4,996880,998560,percent of each other
w_jGkBzhIp4,998560,1001199,it's very close on spring rate but it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1001199,1003839,the damping the damping is a stiffer
w_jGkBzhIp4,1003839,1006320,setup on the sport setting
w_jGkBzhIp4,1006320,1009040,and on the tour you've got slightly more
w_jGkBzhIp4,1009040,1010800,travel at the back
w_jGkBzhIp4,1010800,1013680,the slightly different geo when you put
w_jGkBzhIp4,1013680,1016000,the cup two tiles on to maximize the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1016000,1018240,advantages of the cup two or aggressive
w_jGkBzhIp4,1018240,1020000,guitars are more negative and actually
w_jGkBzhIp4,1020000,1022240,toe out surprised me i said well surely
w_jGkBzhIp4,1022240,1024558,it's just damping couldn't you go for
w_jGkBzhIp4,1024558,1027038,adaptive dampers and have a tour in a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1027038,1028959,sports setting says no
w_jGkBzhIp4,1028959,1031520,not if it's a true lotus adaptive
w_jGkBzhIp4,1031520,1034480,damping isn't good enough the quality of
w_jGkBzhIp4,1034480,1036880,damping you get from a bill stein that
w_jGkBzhIp4,1036880,1039600,is one set in a passive setting so they
w_jGkBzhIp4,1039600,1041600,are sticking with passive setting and
w_jGkBzhIp4,1041600,1043038,it's something to be aware of when
w_jGkBzhIp4,1043038,1045520,you're ordering if you are using the car
w_jGkBzhIp4,1045520,1047520,mainly for road and for the old track
w_jGkBzhIp4,1047520,1049760,day tick tour
w_jGkBzhIp4,1049760,1051840,if you want a more aggressive set up and
w_jGkBzhIp4,1051840,1053840,you want a really special car every time
w_jGkBzhIp4,1053840,1056000,you use it on a sunday or you're doing
w_jGkBzhIp4,1056000,1058960,track days tick sports but be aware
w_jGkBzhIp4,1058960,1060240,there's quite a difference between the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1060240,1061360,two
w_jGkBzhIp4,1061360,1064000,anyway so that was really useful to
w_jGkBzhIp4,1064000,1066720,discover that and to drive the bats back
w_jGkBzhIp4,1066720,1068799,on the same bit of road
w_jGkBzhIp4,1068799,1071840,now what else about this car
w_jGkBzhIp4,1071840,1073520,i think this
w_jGkBzhIp4,1073520,1075120,i ought to start going through some of
w_jGkBzhIp4,1075120,1076720,the lights and dislikes i think with
w_jGkBzhIp4,1076720,1079280,this car i suppose one of the slight
w_jGkBzhIp4,1079280,1082240,dislikes which is a bit of a weird one
w_jGkBzhIp4,1082240,1084799,is it's heavier than i expected
w_jGkBzhIp4,1084799,1086640,i have no idea what it is you've got
w_jGkBzhIp4,1086640,1088240,aluminium structure i went around with a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1088240,1090559,magnet there's no steel body work on it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1090559,1093440,and yet it matches the cayman that's a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1093440,1097200,steel-bodied car with a flat six engine
w_jGkBzhIp4,1097200,1099919,this this car is probably about 14 60
w_jGkBzhIp4,1099919,1103320,kilos of there abouts with a v6 they say
w_jGkBzhIp4,1103320,1106000,114.05 for the lightest version which
w_jGkBzhIp4,1106000,1108880,will be for the four-cylinder
w_jGkBzhIp4,1108880,1110480,oh and the way it revs when he touched
w_jGkBzhIp4,1110480,1112480,its array i just love as well and the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1112480,1114720,power out that was full power
w_jGkBzhIp4,1114720,1118160,takes traction he's off the scale
w_jGkBzhIp4,1118160,1120080,yes sorry i meant to be on the dislikes
w_jGkBzhIp4,1120080,1122799,answer so yeah the weight it just
w_jGkBzhIp4,1122799,1125120,slightly blunts the performance it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1125120,1127679,four point something to sixty
w_jGkBzhIp4,1127679,1130400,but it's a super stiff structure
w_jGkBzhIp4,1130400,1132320,i'm just surprised it's not lighter than
w_jGkBzhIp4,1132320,1134480,it than it actually is when you put it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1134480,1136480,on the scales the thing also about the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1136480,1138000,four center engine that comes in the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1138000,1140320,dual clutch transmission so they're
w_jGkBzhIp4,1140320,1141280,heavy
w_jGkBzhIp4,1141280,1142960,so the actual weight between the two
w_jGkBzhIp4,1142960,1146000,cars is about 54 kilos you would expect
w_jGkBzhIp4,1146000,1148400,you might gain more with a four-cylinder
w_jGkBzhIp4,1148400,1150620,engine versus the v6 supercharged
w_jGkBzhIp4,1150620,1153760,[Applause]
w_jGkBzhIp4,1159250,1161039,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,1161039,1163120,there's not something else so fast with
w_jGkBzhIp4,1163120,1164640,this car it almost feels as though it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1164640,1167280,could have come out five years ago
w_jGkBzhIp4,1167280,1169440,this this doesn't sort of move it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1169440,1172000,doesn't have any new tech on it it's a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1172000,1175600,vora with a wonderful interior wider
w_jGkBzhIp4,1175600,1178799,tracks more dynamics better finished
w_jGkBzhIp4,1178799,1181039,but he hasn't got anything that's super
w_jGkBzhIp4,1181039,1183200,modern on it it's not criticism it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1183200,1185280,just an observation
w_jGkBzhIp4,1185280,1186480,and actually
w_jGkBzhIp4,1186480,1188320,i really love it because i love i've
w_jGkBzhIp4,1188320,1190799,always wanted to own a lotus but there's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1190799,1193200,always been a bus on the interior that's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1193200,1195120,gone away with this edition
w_jGkBzhIp4,1195120,1197520,the final sort of dislike it doesn't
w_jGkBzhIp4,1197520,1200080,sound quite as good as that evora i had
w_jGkBzhIp4,1200080,1203360,in which was spectacular but i guess
w_jGkBzhIp4,1203360,1205520,that's the trouble with gas particulate
w_jGkBzhIp4,1205520,1208720,filters and modern regulations they have
w_jGkBzhIp4,1208720,1211280,slightly strangled the sound of this
w_jGkBzhIp4,1211280,1216280,screaming v6 behind me
w_jGkBzhIp4,1219730,1225039,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,1225039,1226880,now moving on to the lights
w_jGkBzhIp4,1226880,1229120,now there's loads of these much easier
w_jGkBzhIp4,1229120,1231679,to discuss number one looks
w_jGkBzhIp4,1231679,1233360,i just see it outside the house i see it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1233360,1235280,in the garage see it amongst the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1235280,1237919,collection and i just love it i just
w_jGkBzhIp4,1237919,1240960,it's the lotus i've always wanted and it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1240960,1242880,looks modern and fresh and it's a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1242880,1244880,different take and it's instantly
w_jGkBzhIp4,1244880,1246960,recognizable as a lotus
w_jGkBzhIp4,1246960,1248960,absolutely terrific and then you get in
w_jGkBzhIp4,1248960,1249840,it
w_jGkBzhIp4,1249840,1252240,and you think this is it this is what i
w_jGkBzhIp4,1252240,1254960,wanted the price point everything works
w_jGkBzhIp4,1254960,1257200,the livability i've had this for a few
w_jGkBzhIp4,1257200,1258320,days
w_jGkBzhIp4,1258320,1260559,and it's great air conditioning seems to
w_jGkBzhIp4,1260559,1264159,work really well i can um it's quieter
w_jGkBzhIp4,1264159,1266720,than i expected the visibility out is
w_jGkBzhIp4,1266720,1269600,good and in that tour spec the ride is
w_jGkBzhIp4,1269600,1271919,fantastic i think the only thing i've
w_jGkBzhIp4,1271919,1273600,noticed but this is left hand drive just
w_jGkBzhIp4,1273600,1275200,coming out of junctions you're slightly
w_jGkBzhIp4,1275200,1277840,limited that little window
w_jGkBzhIp4,1277840,1279840,at the side there is almost invisible
w_jGkBzhIp4,1279840,1281039,especially if you've got a passenger in
w_jGkBzhIp4,1281039,1283840,the car and there's a pretty tiny rear
w_jGkBzhIp4,1283840,1285760,view out the rear mirror but then you
w_jGkBzhIp4,1285760,1287039,get to see the top of the engine and
w_jGkBzhIp4,1287039,1289520,that funny valve doing its thing
w_jGkBzhIp4,1289520,1292400,so i just love the packaging and
w_jGkBzhIp4,1292400,1295520,everything about the looks and interior
w_jGkBzhIp4,1295520,1296799,then
w_jGkBzhIp4,1296799,1299120,the performance i love the level
w_jGkBzhIp4,1299120,1300320,performance
w_jGkBzhIp4,1300320,1303440,and it's it's vitality it's just this
w_jGkBzhIp4,1303440,1306480,wild thing but it's not too quick
w_jGkBzhIp4,1306480,1308640,it is four point something to sixty it's
w_jGkBzhIp4,1308640,1311600,still 180 miles an hour but the way the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1311600,1314320,opal engine revs the way you're using
w_jGkBzhIp4,1314320,1316159,this gear lever
w_jGkBzhIp4,1316159,1320400,you're involved and it's just ace
w_jGkBzhIp4,1320400,1323520,after all the sort of paddle shift high
w_jGkBzhIp4,1323520,1325760,six 700 horsepower cars that you're just
w_jGkBzhIp4,1325760,1327600,worried about your license
w_jGkBzhIp4,1327600,1329280,there's a joyous
w_jGkBzhIp4,1329280,1331760,delivery of performance this car that is
w_jGkBzhIp4,1331760,1334480,absolutely in the sweet spot it's a
w_jGkBzhIp4,1334480,1336640,great level performance feels plenty
w_jGkBzhIp4,1336640,1337840,quick enough
w_jGkBzhIp4,1337840,1340480,listen to that
w_jGkBzhIp4,1340480,1342960,[Music]
w_jGkBzhIp4,1342960,1345600,i cannot get over the traction
w_jGkBzhIp4,1345600,1347760,i know i'm on cut twos but
w_jGkBzhIp4,1347760,1350480,i'm out of there
w_jGkBzhIp4,1351280,1353679,so yeah there you go
w_jGkBzhIp4,1353679,1355760,it's been worth the wait that's what i
w_jGkBzhIp4,1355760,1357600,would say about this car
w_jGkBzhIp4,1357600,1362080,it's finally the losers with no excuses
w_jGkBzhIp4,1362080,1364000,competing head-on
w_jGkBzhIp4,1364000,1365919,with the other sports car out there and
w_jGkBzhIp4,1365919,1368559,doing what lotus always did best back in
w_jGkBzhIp4,1368559,1370960,the earliest spring days here was this
w_jGkBzhIp4,1370960,1373760,offering from the uk british car
w_jGkBzhIp4,1373760,1376720,that competed with porsche and ferrari
w_jGkBzhIp4,1376720,1378559,in the certain state of lamborghini but
w_jGkBzhIp4,1378559,1380320,at a different price point it's the
w_jGkBzhIp4,1380320,1382960,every man's mclaren if you like and i
w_jGkBzhIp4,1382960,1387760,think the pricing is really clever at 77
w_jGkBzhIp4,1387760,1390559,well seventy six thousand pounds
w_jGkBzhIp4,1390559,1393360,because the avora was overpriced it was
w_jGkBzhIp4,1393360,1395440,always in the eighties and ninety
w_jGkBzhIp4,1395440,1397440,thousand pounds it was just too much for
w_jGkBzhIp4,1397440,1399760,the compromised interior all that is
w_jGkBzhIp4,1399760,1400720,gone
w_jGkBzhIp4,1400720,1402720,no wonder there's a two-year wait for
w_jGkBzhIp4,1402720,1405440,this car because it absolutely delivers
w_jGkBzhIp4,1405440,1408000,what you want from a new lotus sports
w_jGkBzhIp4,1408000,1411280,car no more excuses lotus are back i've
