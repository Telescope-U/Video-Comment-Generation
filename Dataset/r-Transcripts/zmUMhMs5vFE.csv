zmUMhMs5vFE,80,1599,this is the sketchbook that got me
zmUMhMs5vFE,1599,4400,rejected from art school in 2000 i was
zmUMhMs5vFE,4400,5920,graduating high school applying to
zmUMhMs5vFE,5920,8000,colleges and i wanted to go to sheridan
zmUMhMs5vFE,8000,9679,college which at the time had a really
zmUMhMs5vFE,9679,12320,renowned animation program they required
zmUMhMs5vFE,12320,14960,a portfolio though and i couldn't really
zmUMhMs5vFE,14960,17119,draw this was about the level of my
zmUMhMs5vFE,17119,20000,drawing at 19 years old that's my name i
zmUMhMs5vFE,20000,21600,think you can tell by the way i drew
zmUMhMs5vFE,21600,23920,that i was trying to copy other art you
zmUMhMs5vFE,23920,25680,know i didn't really understand it yet
zmUMhMs5vFE,25680,27599,now look i i don't want to laugh at my
zmUMhMs5vFE,27599,30400,19 year old self this kid had hope he
zmUMhMs5vFE,30400,32000,just didn't have skill part of
zmUMhMs5vFE,32000,34000,sheridan's portfolio was a life drawing
zmUMhMs5vFE,34000,36079,assignment this is probably my first
zmUMhMs5vFE,36079,38480,ever life drawing oh yes sheridan wanted
zmUMhMs5vFE,38480,41360,us to draw a room in perspective i had
zmUMhMs5vFE,41360,43600,no idea how to draw perspective the
zmUMhMs5vFE,43600,45200,other assignment was they gave us a
zmUMhMs5vFE,45200,46719,character design and had us draw
zmUMhMs5vFE,46719,48879,expressions this here is a tracing of
zmUMhMs5vFE,48879,50559,the character they provided and then
zmUMhMs5vFE,50559,52640,that's my expression sheet around it i
zmUMhMs5vFE,52640,54719,was trying i really tried i sent them
zmUMhMs5vFE,54719,56480,scanned copies of this portfolio and of
zmUMhMs5vFE,56480,57840,course you know you don't get into a
zmUMhMs5vFE,57840,59760,school when the envelope you get back is
zmUMhMs5vFE,59760,61920,this thin so yeah i didn't get into
zmUMhMs5vFE,61920,64720,sheridan college so that was 2000 fast
zmUMhMs5vFE,64720,68640,forward now 17 years and disney asked me
zmUMhMs5vFE,68640,70560,to paint the book version of their
zmUMhMs5vFE,70560,72560,nutcracker film and they wanted me to do
zmUMhMs5vFE,72560,75439,it in my own painting style i got to be
zmUMhMs5vFE,75439,77680,brushy and expressive and do everything
zmUMhMs5vFE,77680,79360,i love i had so much fun working on
zmUMhMs5vFE,79360,81280,these illustrations the room is in
zmUMhMs5vFE,81280,83360,perspective uh here's one of my favorite
zmUMhMs5vFE,83360,84960,paintings from the book this page here
zmUMhMs5vFE,84960,86880,was more refined more of a standard
zmUMhMs5vFE,86880,89439,portrait i had to use 17 years of art
zmUMhMs5vFE,89439,91840,experience to get these poses just right
zmUMhMs5vFE,91840,93119,and of course make them look like they
zmUMhMs5vFE,93119,95600,had form and light and texture obviously
zmUMhMs5vFE,95600,97680,i learned a lot of lessons between this
zmUMhMs5vFE,97680,99600,and this and in this video i want to
zmUMhMs5vFE,99600,101759,account for them where i learned things
zmUMhMs5vFE,101759,103840,when i learned things and how i apply
zmUMhMs5vFE,103840,106079,them to my work as a professional this
zmUMhMs5vFE,106079,108720,is some of my early cg work it got me
zmUMhMs5vFE,108720,110799,accepted into ryerson university in
zmUMhMs5vFE,110799,113439,toronto i did their film studies program
zmUMhMs5vFE,113439,115600,there was no drawing though so my
zmUMhMs5vFE,115600,117840,university was here and as luck would
zmUMhMs5vFE,117840,119840,have it i discovered that just up the
zmUMhMs5vFE,119840,122159,street was a life drawing studio now
zmUMhMs5vFE,122159,124240,when i was younger i did not know that
zmUMhMs5vFE,124240,126960,it was possible to learn how to draw i
zmUMhMs5vFE,126960,128720,thought you had to be born with it a
zmUMhMs5vFE,128720,130959,talent and i didn't have the talent
zmUMhMs5vFE,130959,132640,that's why i was doing all the cg stuff
zmUMhMs5vFE,132640,134239,in the first place i figured i can't
zmUMhMs5vFE,134239,135920,draw maybe i could do art on the
zmUMhMs5vFE,135920,138400,computer does anyone remember this viral
zmUMhMs5vFE,138400,140720,animation from 1999
zmUMhMs5vFE,140720,143120,this piece landed victor navone his job
zmUMhMs5vFE,143120,145360,at pixar when i went to his website i
zmUMhMs5vFE,145360,147280,was kind of dismayed to see that p could
zmUMhMs5vFE,147280,149680,draw but he also recommended taking life
zmUMhMs5vFE,149680,151680,drawing classes which he was doing to
zmUMhMs5vFE,151680,154000,help with his animation now when i went
zmUMhMs5vFE,154000,156239,for my first life drawing session nude
zmUMhMs5vFE,156239,158400,model posing i approached the drawings
zmUMhMs5vFE,158400,160480,like this you know trying to get a
zmUMhMs5vFE,160480,162640,finished contour right off the bat my
zmUMhMs5vFE,162640,164560,drawings were failures i wish i still
zmUMhMs5vFE,164560,166239,had some of them to show you but i mean
zmUMhMs5vFE,166239,168400,you've seen this anyway the guy who
zmUMhMs5vFE,168400,170319,owned the life drawing studio was nick
zmUMhMs5vFE,170319,172480,kalistian a fantastic artist go check
zmUMhMs5vFE,172480,174239,him out after seeing some of nick's
zmUMhMs5vFE,174239,176400,three to five minute life drawings it
zmUMhMs5vFE,176400,178319,became clear that my approach to drawing
zmUMhMs5vFE,178319,180640,had to fundamentally change nick showed
zmUMhMs5vFE,180640,182640,me how his teacher glenn vilpou would
zmUMhMs5vFE,182640,185040,draw these things called gestures and a
zmUMhMs5vFE,185040,186800,gesture drawing wasn't supposed to look
zmUMhMs5vFE,186800,188640,finished or pretty it's a method of
zmUMhMs5vFE,188640,190800,drawing designed to quickly capture the
zmUMhMs5vFE,190800,193040,feel of a pose and that's it a gesture
zmUMhMs5vFE,193040,194959,drawing can very quickly indicate things
zmUMhMs5vFE,194959,197280,like weight balance and movement very
zmUMhMs5vFE,197280,199040,important features of any style of
zmUMhMs5vFE,199040,201040,drawing you can play with exaggerating
zmUMhMs5vFE,201040,203200,it too in this case to really feel say
zmUMhMs5vFE,203200,205519,the thrust of her hips the outstretched
zmUMhMs5vFE,205519,208400,elbow the weight on her left leg there
zmUMhMs5vFE,208400,210640,are no rules to drawing a gesture but
zmUMhMs5vFE,210640,212560,one piece of advice i do have when you
zmUMhMs5vFE,212560,215680,draw a gesture be gestural doing this
zmUMhMs5vFE,215680,217040,will help you find the larger
zmUMhMs5vFE,217040,219360,relationships within a pose for example
zmUMhMs5vFE,219360,221280,the counterbalanced shoulders and hips
zmUMhMs5vFE,221280,223360,here and the graceful arc that connects
zmUMhMs5vFE,223360,225599,them also the related circular rhythm
zmUMhMs5vFE,225599,227920,for the legs and by the way i am using
zmUMhMs5vFE,227920,231120,the wacom cintiq pro 32 what a piece of
zmUMhMs5vFE,231120,233120,machinery however i only got this
zmUMhMs5vFE,233120,236159,machine last week for the past 20 years
zmUMhMs5vFE,236159,238560,i've been doing my art with this wacom
zmUMhMs5vFE,238560,241280,intuos 3. look how worn down it is i'll
zmUMhMs5vFE,241280,242720,talk about these tools a little more
zmUMhMs5vFE,242720,245040,later in the video so back to gesture
zmUMhMs5vFE,245040,246480,the shoulders and hips are giving me a
zmUMhMs5vFE,246480,248560,bit of drama in this pose but there's a
zmUMhMs5vFE,248560,250799,lot of drama in that outstretched arm
zmUMhMs5vFE,250799,252799,i'll use a straight for that another
zmUMhMs5vFE,252799,255040,straight to show the weight on this leg
zmUMhMs5vFE,255040,257040,straights tend to portray speed or
zmUMhMs5vFE,257040,259600,strength so gesture captures rhythm but
zmUMhMs5vFE,259600,261919,what is rhythm to me rhythm is an
zmUMhMs5vFE,261919,264160,abstract through line it gracefully
zmUMhMs5vFE,264160,266160,connects all the parts of a pose and
zmUMhMs5vFE,266160,268240,helps ensure that together they add up
zmUMhMs5vFE,268240,270639,to something gesture is present in so
zmUMhMs5vFE,270639,273040,much good art it just works under the
zmUMhMs5vFE,273040,275759,surface so i drew exclusively gestures
zmUMhMs5vFE,275759,277440,for several months most of them have
zmUMhMs5vFE,277440,279199,been long since thrown away but here's a
zmUMhMs5vFE,279199,281120,few i still do have gesture was the
zmUMhMs5vFE,281120,283600,first real tool i had in my artistic
zmUMhMs5vFE,283600,285680,development character-wise you can
zmUMhMs5vFE,285680,288240,explore anything with gesture from a
zmUMhMs5vFE,288240,291680,squirrel to a wingless dragon to a
zmUMhMs5vFE,291680,294160,sword-wielding warrior to
zmUMhMs5vFE,294160,296960,spider-man gestures don't need style
zmUMhMs5vFE,296960,298479,they're not finished drawings they're
zmUMhMs5vFE,298479,300960,just information you use to proceed
zmUMhMs5vFE,300960,303199,gesture drawing doesn't necessarily look
zmUMhMs5vFE,303199,305120,impressive i remember telling my parents
zmUMhMs5vFE,305120,306639,i was learning to draw and showing them
zmUMhMs5vFE,306639,308479,my gestures and they were like
zmUMhMs5vFE,308479,309440,okay
zmUMhMs5vFE,309440,311440,but the next thing nick introduced me to
zmUMhMs5vFE,311440,313520,was breaking down the figure into basic
zmUMhMs5vFE,313520,315360,forms we would put a piece of tracing
zmUMhMs5vFE,315360,317280,paper over a photograph of the figure
zmUMhMs5vFE,317280,319520,and we would reconstruct it with boxes
zmUMhMs5vFE,319520,321520,and cylinders look at how the box for
zmUMhMs5vFE,321520,323840,the torso here captures the twist in the
zmUMhMs5vFE,323840,326080,body i'll throw a center line down that
zmUMhMs5vFE,326080,327840,box to further help me understand the
zmUMhMs5vFE,327840,329759,dimension then the arms we would
zmUMhMs5vFE,329759,331840,construct with two cylinders then we
zmUMhMs5vFE,331840,333680,would square those off in this way
zmUMhMs5vFE,333680,335440,you're understanding both the roundness
zmUMhMs5vFE,335440,337520,and the planes of the arm often we would
zmUMhMs5vFE,337520,339759,draw through the geometry see those
zmUMhMs5vFE,339759,342000,ghost ellipses going behind the leg and
zmUMhMs5vFE,342000,343360,this is how we come up with very
zmUMhMs5vFE,343360,345520,three-dimensional drawings this was part
zmUMhMs5vFE,345520,347360,of an informal class that nick was
zmUMhMs5vFE,347360,349600,teaching it was three hours a week for
zmUMhMs5vFE,349600,351600,six weeks it's the closest thing i ever
zmUMhMs5vFE,351600,353840,had to art school so you take the
zmUMhMs5vFE,353840,356639,gesture you take the form and mash them
zmUMhMs5vFE,356639,358880,and my drawing started looking like this
zmUMhMs5vFE,358880,361039,remember i started from here and this is
zmUMhMs5vFE,361039,363520,about a three year timeline to get there
zmUMhMs5vFE,363520,365360,i want to show you a recreation of my
zmUMhMs5vFE,365360,367360,process at the time i'm mapping out the
zmUMhMs5vFE,367360,369520,gesture shoulder lines hip lines the
zmUMhMs5vFE,369520,371600,rhythm that connects them then extending
zmUMhMs5vFE,371600,373680,those rhythms through the limbs then i
zmUMhMs5vFE,373680,375759,would start working out volumes but i
zmUMhMs5vFE,375759,377520,wouldn't do it quite as rigidly as the
zmUMhMs5vFE,377520,379680,demo i just showed you i am drawing
zmUMhMs5vFE,379680,381680,three-dimensional cylinders and boxes
zmUMhMs5vFE,381680,384080,but i'm trying to respect the gesture
zmUMhMs5vFE,384080,386000,you know keep it intact while adding
zmUMhMs5vFE,386000,388560,these more rigid forms so this is what
zmUMhMs5vFE,388560,390400,my life drawings looked like for about a
zmUMhMs5vFE,390400,392560,year and a half okay that's actually not
zmUMhMs5vFE,392560,394880,quite true they looked more like this
zmUMhMs5vFE,394880,397600,same philosophy but poorer execution
zmUMhMs5vFE,397600,399840,that was my very first drawing done with
zmUMhMs5vFE,399840,402720,a tablet you see in 2003 i was convinced
zmUMhMs5vFE,402720,404960,i could become a professional artist it
zmUMhMs5vFE,404960,407280,was a huge moment for me so i went out
zmUMhMs5vFE,407280,409440,and bought a tablet i chose wacom
zmUMhMs5vFE,409440,411360,because hey it's the industry standard
zmUMhMs5vFE,411360,413280,trust me i've tried them all it is
zmUMhMs5vFE,413280,416319,pronounced wacom by the way not wacom or
zmUMhMs5vFE,416319,420240,wacom wa in japanese means harmony and
zmUMhMs5vFE,420240,423680,com computer harmony computer so anyway
zmUMhMs5vFE,423680,425680,these drawings done about a year later
zmUMhMs5vFE,425680,428160,do have one more element at play
zmUMhMs5vFE,428160,430479,shapes shape is the fundamental that
zmUMhMs5vFE,430479,432160,packages all the information and
zmUMhMs5vFE,432160,433520,delivers it to the viewer in a
zmUMhMs5vFE,433520,435680,digestible way i studied a lot of
zmUMhMs5vFE,435680,437919,animators drawings in my early years in
zmUMhMs5vFE,437919,439840,this rough pass look at how the attitude
zmUMhMs5vFE,439840,441680,of the character is fully worked out in
zmUMhMs5vFE,441680,444400,gesture it reads perfectly compare that
zmUMhMs5vFE,444400,446000,to the next pass which has all the
zmUMhMs5vFE,446000,448720,shapes designed it gains sophistication
zmUMhMs5vFE,448720,450560,but the feeling was established before
zmUMhMs5vFE,450560,452639,this let's do a little comparison take
zmUMhMs5vFE,452639,455280,the arm for example in the gestured arm
zmUMhMs5vFE,455280,457280,it's almost perfectly symmetrical here
zmUMhMs5vFE,457280,459039,and here that's because the design
zmUMhMs5vFE,459039,461199,hasn't really been considered yet now in
zmUMhMs5vFE,461199,462960,the shape stage we're solving a very
zmUMhMs5vFE,462960,465280,different problem we usually don't want
zmUMhMs5vFE,465280,467520,repetition or symmetry but we do want to
zmUMhMs5vFE,467520,470240,retain a cohesive flow good shapes do
zmUMhMs5vFE,470240,472479,have a flow to them this book came out
zmUMhMs5vFE,472479,474960,in 2001 and i was instantly obsessed
zmUMhMs5vFE,474960,477280,with claire wendling's shapes but let's
zmUMhMs5vFE,477280,479280,not get distracted by the cool subject
zmUMhMs5vFE,479280,481280,matter take something more mundane
zmUMhMs5vFE,481280,483120,perfect i'm studying the shape by
zmUMhMs5vFE,483120,485039,breaking my strokes into segments
zmUMhMs5vFE,485039,487199,there's a subtle s curve here followed
zmUMhMs5vFE,487199,489440,by a hook which is then followed by a
zmUMhMs5vFE,489440,492800,sweeping c curve another hook another c
zmUMhMs5vFE,492800,494960,curve and then a subtle s curve at the
zmUMhMs5vFE,494960,497919,end to mirror the beginning it's poetry
zmUMhMs5vFE,497919,499840,so even though this is traced it's a
zmUMhMs5vFE,499840,501759,method i would use to study shapes
zmUMhMs5vFE,501759,503759,here's another simple exercise take a
zmUMhMs5vFE,503759,506400,basic shape like a square then redraw it
zmUMhMs5vFE,506400,509120,but a bit askew almost like some force
zmUMhMs5vFE,509120,511039,has been applied to it try it again
zmUMhMs5vFE,511039,513518,maybe adding a curve to one of the sides
zmUMhMs5vFE,513518,515518,want that shape to look dimensional try
zmUMhMs5vFE,515518,517760,adding cross contours going over the
zmUMhMs5vFE,517760,519839,form this is simple but it leads to
zmUMhMs5vFE,519839,521919,great possibilities my green monster
zmUMhMs5vFE,521919,524000,character is just a circle and these two
zmUMhMs5vFE,524000,525519,character designs are basically
zmUMhMs5vFE,525519,527200,inversions of each other this is not
zmUMhMs5vFE,527200,529040,just for cartoons either here's a piece
zmUMhMs5vFE,529040,530959,i did for the eternals keeping the
zmUMhMs5vFE,530959,532800,silhouette shape clear gives you the
zmUMhMs5vFE,532800,534800,freedom to do tons of stuff inside the
zmUMhMs5vFE,534800,536880,silhouette these are professional tools
zmUMhMs5vFE,536880,539040,now befitting a professional setup say
zmUMhMs5vFE,539040,541760,hello to the wacom 32-inch cintiq with
zmUMhMs5vFE,541760,544800,the flex arm of course huh a manual i'm
zmUMhMs5vFE,544800,547839,sure it's helpful so you remove this tab
zmUMhMs5vFE,547839,549519,and the cables go in
zmUMhMs5vFE,549519,550880,like this
zmUMhMs5vFE,550880,552640,wait what
zmUMhMs5vFE,552640,554560,oh this comes out first and then wraps
zmUMhMs5vFE,554560,555920,got it
zmUMhMs5vFE,555920,557680,what the heck
zmUMhMs5vFE,557680,559839,okay cables go through this
zmUMhMs5vFE,559839,562560,do the wrappy thing and screw it in this
zmUMhMs5vFE,562560,565200,is a heavy duty bracket
zmUMhMs5vFE,565200,567200,hey look i'm an auto mechanic
zmUMhMs5vFE,567200,569519,this part's satisfying watch this
zmUMhMs5vFE,569519,574079,i love that i don't however love this
zmUMhMs5vFE,575600,578000,okay so stop rolling the cameras change
zmUMhMs5vFE,578000,580399,my son's diaper and here's my final
zmUMhMs5vFE,580399,582640,setup this is where i make my living and
zmUMhMs5vFE,582640,584399,wacom has always helped create a
zmUMhMs5vFE,584399,587360,comfortable creative space and after 20
zmUMhMs5vFE,587360,590000,years i swapped out my old intuos for an
zmUMhMs5vFE,590000,592399,intuos pro and check this out i can use
zmUMhMs5vFE,592399,595760,the same pen on this device and this one
zmUMhMs5vFE,595760,598080,that is fantastic all right back to
zmUMhMs5vFE,598080,600399,shapes you can use shapes in a thematic
zmUMhMs5vFE,600399,602399,way take this chunky baby that's my
zmUMhMs5vFE,602399,604640,daughter the shapes are mostly round
zmUMhMs5vFE,604640,606320,basing your shapes on a theme can help
zmUMhMs5vFE,606320,608720,you arrive at a good design that big guy
zmUMhMs5vFE,608720,610880,there was designed around squares this
zmUMhMs5vFE,610880,612720,was for a children's book project i did
zmUMhMs5vFE,612720,615600,around 2012. they're all squares but
zmUMhMs5vFE,615600,617040,they've all been warped in different
zmUMhMs5vFE,617040,619760,ways different sizes too the variety
zmUMhMs5vFE,619760,622000,helps minimize the repetition i first
zmUMhMs5vFE,622000,624000,gained an appreciation of this from lilo
zmUMhMs5vFE,624000,626800,and stitch in 2002 chris sanders brought
zmUMhMs5vFE,626800,629040,his signature round shapes to the entire
zmUMhMs5vFE,629040,631200,movie it's a stylistic choice but one
zmUMhMs5vFE,631200,633279,that's derived from life's visual
zmUMhMs5vFE,633279,634240,lessons
zmUMhMs5vFE,634240,636000,this on the other hand is not a
zmUMhMs5vFE,636000,638320,successful example of shape design one
zmUMhMs5vFE,638320,640079,of the biggest critiques i have of this
zmUMhMs5vFE,640079,642399,is the marshmallow effect it's caused by
zmUMhMs5vFE,642399,645040,repetitive symmetry see nature almost
zmUMhMs5vFE,645040,647360,never does that instead you'll see what
zmUMhMs5vFE,647360,649760,i call offset symmetry i'll trace the
zmUMhMs5vFE,649760,652079,curves of the calf muscle plot the apex
zmUMhMs5vFE,652079,654240,points and shoot a line through them the
zmUMhMs5vFE,654240,656480,symmetry happens on the diagonal in the
zmUMhMs5vFE,656480,658399,lilo and stitch style guide there's a
zmUMhMs5vFE,658399,660480,warning against obvious symmetry
zmUMhMs5vFE,660480,662640,there's two solutions to it you could
zmUMhMs5vFE,662640,664720,offset the symmetry as in this example
zmUMhMs5vFE,664720,666959,here or you could put two totally
zmUMhMs5vFE,666959,668880,different lines up against each other a
zmUMhMs5vFE,668880,671440,curve versus a straight the eye just
zmUMhMs5vFE,671440,673519,likes variety and every artist i've ever
zmUMhMs5vFE,673519,675360,studied has the curve versus straight
zmUMhMs5vFE,675360,677440,thing in their visual vocabulary but
zmUMhMs5vFE,677440,679040,it's not the curve or the straight
zmUMhMs5vFE,679040,680880,that's important it's this part
zmUMhMs5vFE,680880,682880,something versus something how about
zmUMhMs5vFE,682880,684800,this match up here's a beautiful piece
zmUMhMs5vFE,684800,687120,by lois look how simple this side of the
zmUMhMs5vFE,687120,688959,silhouette is compared to what's going
zmUMhMs5vFE,688959,691360,on on this side that stuff doesn't just
zmUMhMs5vFE,691360,693360,happen by accident you have to really
zmUMhMs5vFE,693360,695440,think about how to design it this was
zmUMhMs5vFE,695440,697360,for an animation character design job i
zmUMhMs5vFE,697360,700160,did around 2017 and to this day i start
zmUMhMs5vFE,700160,702640,with some form of gesture however your
zmUMhMs5vFE,702640,704480,shapes can go a hundred different ways
zmUMhMs5vFE,704480,706160,from there just because you have a
zmUMhMs5vFE,706160,708160,workable gesture does not guarantee
zmUMhMs5vFE,708160,710240,you'll have a good drawing so as i'm
zmUMhMs5vFE,710240,712240,putting down these lines i'm exploring
zmUMhMs5vFE,712240,714720,the something versus something idea
zmUMhMs5vFE,714720,716560,that's why the lines are going in in
zmUMhMs5vFE,716560,718160,segments like i did with the
zmUMhMs5vFE,718160,720160,clairwendeling shape study i'm trying to
zmUMhMs5vFE,720160,722240,figure out the puzzle piece by piece
zmUMhMs5vFE,722240,724240,this is a problem-solving part of art
zmUMhMs5vFE,724240,726399,that i really enjoy and i've learned to
zmUMhMs5vFE,726399,728639,take my time in solving it see a
zmUMhMs5vFE,728639,730800,beginner's work virtually always lacks
zmUMhMs5vFE,730800,732959,that type of exploration and there's a
zmUMhMs5vFE,732959,735200,stiffness that results the solutions i
zmUMhMs5vFE,735200,737519,came up with here include slim at the
zmUMhMs5vFE,737519,739760,top wide at the bottom creating little
zmUMhMs5vFE,739760,741279,hooks to break up an otherwise
zmUMhMs5vFE,741279,743440,continuous line i'm offsetting the
zmUMhMs5vFE,743440,745760,symmetry in four different places i'm
zmUMhMs5vFE,745760,747680,also trying to connect different areas
zmUMhMs5vFE,747680,749760,of the drawing with hidden rhythms and
zmUMhMs5vFE,749760,751680,just generally trying to avoid any sense
zmUMhMs5vFE,751680,754399,of obvious repetition and again all of
zmUMhMs5vFE,754399,756320,this applies to more realistic art as
zmUMhMs5vFE,756320,758240,well check out this page i did for the
zmUMhMs5vFE,758240,760240,nutcracker there's a gestural rhythm
zmUMhMs5vFE,760240,762079,going through it tracking the shoulder
zmUMhMs5vFE,762079,764160,line even tried some thematic rhythms to
zmUMhMs5vFE,764160,766480,help unify the piece if you're feeling
zmUMhMs5vFE,766480,768320,really cheeky you can take an overall
zmUMhMs5vFE,768320,770320,gestural rhythm a line of action and
zmUMhMs5vFE,770320,772560,just use it as one of the contours i'd
zmUMhMs5vFE,772560,774160,say this line here represents the
zmUMhMs5vFE,774160,776160,gesture in this drawing so i'll just
zmUMhMs5vFE,776160,777680,move that line out here and start
zmUMhMs5vFE,777680,779680,building up my study of it as far as i
zmUMhMs5vFE,779680,781920,remember this is a discovery i made on
zmUMhMs5vFE,781920,784240,my own i'm not saying i invented it but
zmUMhMs5vFE,784240,786160,it only came to me after probably a few
zmUMhMs5vFE,786160,788079,years of working with the concept of
zmUMhMs5vFE,788079,790320,gesture you need time to see how these
zmUMhMs5vFE,790320,791920,things can apply to your art just
zmUMhMs5vFE,791920,793360,because you learn something one day it
zmUMhMs5vFE,793360,795120,doesn't mean you can apply it the next
zmUMhMs5vFE,795120,796720,day so if you're just starting learning
zmUMhMs5vFE,796720,797760,art and you're learning all these new
zmUMhMs5vFE,797760,799920,concepts my advice is give it some time
zmUMhMs5vFE,799920,802720,to truly sink in and seep its way into
zmUMhMs5vFE,802720,805279,your work to me this is where anatomy
zmUMhMs5vFE,805279,807920,comes in anatomy is full of rhythms i
zmUMhMs5vFE,807920,810079,just love how the serratus muscle fans
zmUMhMs5vFE,810079,812560,into the external obliques anatomy can
zmUMhMs5vFE,812560,814959,piggyback on basic forms and add a whole
zmUMhMs5vFE,814959,817040,lot of sophistication to your drawing
zmUMhMs5vFE,817040,819279,but i don't recommend putting anatomy at
zmUMhMs5vFE,819279,821519,the forefront of your study too soon i
zmUMhMs5vFE,821519,823360,didn't dive into anatomy for several
zmUMhMs5vFE,823360,825519,years and i think my understanding of
zmUMhMs5vFE,825519,827680,the more basic fundamentals benefited
zmUMhMs5vFE,827680,830000,from that so when i finally did start
zmUMhMs5vFE,830000,831839,breaking open the anatomy textbooks i
zmUMhMs5vFE,831839,834000,kind of had a hierarchy in place to plug
zmUMhMs5vFE,834000,836160,it into this is another page from the
zmUMhMs5vFE,836160,838000,nutcracker book let me zoom in on the
zmUMhMs5vFE,838000,840320,figure here look at this arm it's
zmUMhMs5vFE,840320,842560,outstretched but it's not just straight
zmUMhMs5vFE,842560,844800,it's got some action to it anatomy will
zmUMhMs5vFE,844800,846720,teach you that the arm has a chain-link
zmUMhMs5vFE,846720,848959,rhythm each muscle group is one link of
zmUMhMs5vFE,848959,851680,the chain but then i also bent the chain
zmUMhMs5vFE,851680,854000,as driven by a simple gesture so the
zmUMhMs5vFE,854000,855920,painting of it was really derived by
zmUMhMs5vFE,855920,858639,drawing ah painting kind of a whole new
zmUMhMs5vFE,858639,860720,can of worms and we'll break it open in
zmUMhMs5vFE,860720,862399,the next installment i want to thank
zmUMhMs5vFE,862399,864240,wacom for their generous support and
zmUMhMs5vFE,864240,866079,being there for my whole art career as
zmUMhMs5vFE,866079,868160,well as a big thanks to my patrons thank
zmUMhMs5vFE,868160,869760,you for watching and i'll see you in the
zmUMhMs5vFE,869760,872720,next video
