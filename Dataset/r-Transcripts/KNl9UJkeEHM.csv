KNl9UJkeEHM,169920,176000,interact with all of you all throughout  the night so nothing is official and so  until it is we'll continue to ask this
KNl9UJkeEHM,176000,182000,who's going to go number one sounds like  it's going to be jabari smith but again  nothing official there type js if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,182000,187040,think it'll be him this is also the live  poll question by the way so vote there  type ch if you think it's going to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,187040,194239,chat holmgren you can also type pb if  you think it's going to be palo bencaro  all signs and reports suggest that
KNl9UJkeEHM,194239,200400,jabari smith chase will go to the  orlando match that's been the  speculation for a really long time and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,200400,206640,lot of nba league executives would be  surprised if smith doesn't go number one  to orlando you look at that team right
KNl9UJkeEHM,206640,212879,now they're pretty set at the guard  position with cole anthony markell  jalen suggs
KNl9UJkeEHM,212879,219519,last year they drafted franz wagner  after suggs i thought wendell carter  played really well last year for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,219519,226159,magic so you look at the position of  need it's a wing it's jabari smith it's  a guy who knocked down more than 40
KNl9UJkeEHM,226159,231920,percent of his shots from three-point  distance last year and is a crazy  athlete now bruce pearl yesterday
KNl9UJkeEHM,231920,237519,compared him to kevin durant i think  that's lofty praise but he's 6 10 with a  high release point nobody can really
KNl9UJkeEHM,237519,243439,block his shots and he can score and  shoot it and basically get anywhere on  the floor to get his shot off so that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,243439,249120,why that comparison is there in my mock  draft which we'll take a look at in just  a few minutes i do have smith going
KNl9UJkeEHM,249120,255439,number one i think chet is going to go  to okc then palomancaro number three to  the houston rockets which down the road
KNl9UJkeEHM,255439,261919,could end up being a steal kj career  mode says jabari smith robert bruce  going with van caro uh don't think it'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,261919,268240,be jaden hardy uh richard lee uh kai  soto from jaylou in the chat uh let's
KNl9UJkeEHM,268240,276479,see it is jabari smith from mike dibble  he's back chase doubles back dibble in  the chat get those supers ready baby okc

KNl9UJkeEHM,387199,394160,i said others could potentially do this  we got a liddy cam which we'll introduce  later on in the show i think we agreed
KNl9UJkeEHM,394160,399280,once we get to  hundred dollars in super chat hundred  dollars introduce the super uh the liddy

KNl9UJkeEHM,426880,432880,francisco chase he just keeps typing kai  he wants kaiser he wants soda to get  dropped
KNl9UJkeEHM,432880,438720,frankly or if he's a udfa we'll cover it  too is he gonna get drafted i don't  think he gets drafted i don't but i do
KNl9UJkeEHM,438720,444400,think that he becomes one of the most  sought after undrafted free agents and  then you know what's cool have an
KNl9UJkeEHM,444400,449919,opportunity to see what he can do  hopefully in the nba summer league if he  doesn't have international commitments  we'll get some shout outs going in a
KNl9UJkeEHM,449919,455759,second but colin reid taking over the  show with the 10 super chat you send in  10 bucks we'll talk about your favorite
KNl9UJkeEHM,455759,462400,team what's a successful night for the  oklahoma city thunder chase as they  select at number two look if i'm at
KNl9UJkeEHM,462400,468080,number two and i'm okc i'm not drafting  chet holmgren i'm going palo bencaro and
KNl9UJkeEHM,468080,475120,if jabari smith drops i'm going jabari  smith i might even think about going  jaden ivy and benedict matheran over
KNl9UJkeEHM,475120,480240,chet holmgren that's how high i am on  some of the other prospects and those  are the worries that i have
KNl9UJkeEHM,480240,485599,when it comes down to chet holmgren but  i think all indications are that the okc
KNl9UJkeEHM,485599,490639,thunder want to draft chet and chet and  his agent want to go to the thunder and
KNl9UJkeEHM,490639,497599,the fit does make sense because of all  the other pieces they have on that team  josh giddy shake gilges alexander lou
KNl9UJkeEHM,497599,504080,dort so let's say you take him at number  two you have that pick at number 12.  jeremy sohan
KNl9UJkeEHM,504080,510800,i think that's a really good selection  for okc a plug-and-play player who does  all of the other things outside of
KNl9UJkeEHM,510800,517279,scoring at a really level but i also  think he has a pretty clean three-point  shot so i think that he is a potential
KNl9UJkeEHM,517279,524080,budding superstar if he can become a  more consistent shooter so chet holmgren  jeremy sohan has your draymond green or
KNl9UJkeEHM,524080,530080,ben simmons of the four type of player  think about oklahoma city too and  continue to shout out your favorite team  we'll get some shout outs going is
KNl9UJkeEHM,530080,537680,they've got all these future first round  picks so if they want to move up from 12  to 6 7 8 and move up for a second player
KNl9UJkeEHM,537680,542959,in the top 10 they've got the ammunition  to do it so they could be a team to  watch out for tonight got to do the
KNl9UJkeEHM,542959,548320,roulette wheel spin too for that 10  super chat that came in so we got to get  that right oh you're right yeah i
KNl9UJkeEHM,548320,553360,thought uh five ten dollars to talk  about your favorite team that's f uh  five dollars though yeah we'll do that

KNl9UJkeEHM,710560,716160,so there he goes all right mitchell  wrens we'll catch up with him a little  bit later 100 bucks in super chats and
KNl9UJkeEHM,716160,721360,we will  have a what  entire company wide shot we'll take one
KNl9UJkeEHM,721360,726480,too yeah  all right here we go sean cheranya this  is from earlier chase catching everybody
KNl9UJkeEHM,726480,732880,up on the kevin durant and kyrie irving  stuff he tweeted about a couple of hours  ago that durant is monitoring the
KNl9UJkeEHM,732880,739760,brooklyn net's future and considering  his options uh that of course opens the  path for kyrie irving to go ahead and go
KNl9UJkeEHM,739760,746560,through with the potential trade he  would opt in to make that happen of  course he has a player option  woj added this
KNl9UJkeEHM,746560,753120,saying if kyrie doesn't stay with  brooklyn he has a list of teams he's  interested in  that's the lakers clippers knicks heat
KNl9UJkeEHM,753120,758639,mavs and 76ers none of those teams have  cap space to sign in without the net's  help obviously there'd have to be a lot
KNl9UJkeEHM,758639,763680,of moving parts on that front  uh woach says those are the teams who
KNl9UJkeEHM,763680,768880,he's interested in but uh it isn't  necessarily a priority for all of them  so
KNl9UJkeEHM,768880,775279,you know we kind of broke this down on a  video earlier i'm pretty firm i don't  think kyrie will play for the nets next
KNl9UJkeEHM,775279,780800,year because i think they've made it  clear they don't want to commit to him  long term uh and he probably just feels
KNl9UJkeEHM,780800,786639,okay i'll just go and move on in with  the new team and what a loss it would be  for the brooklyn nets just a year after
KNl9UJkeEHM,786639,792800,they had james harden kevin durant and  kyrie irving two of these guys could end  up leaving in kd as well as kyrie and
KNl9UJkeEHM,792800,800560,both are sensational offensive players  both bring different elements on both  ends of the floor to the floor k.d more
KNl9UJkeEHM,800560,806079,of a two-way threat one of the best  offensive players that we've ever seen  and kyrie irving is just a magician with
KNl9UJkeEHM,806079,812480,the basketball a three level scorer who  can knock down threes get to the hoop  and then is just masterful finishing
KNl9UJkeEHM,812480,819279,around the rim and for brooklyn  what do you do and where do you go you  could get an all-time package back for
KNl9UJkeEHM,819279,825199,kd who's still a top three player in the  nba when he's healthy and then for kyrie
KNl9UJkeEHM,825199,831839,it's just been a frustrating experiment  because he hasn't played that much he's  played very sparingly with the nets over
KNl9UJkeEHM,831839,837040,the last couple of years and when you  originally brought in kd and kyrie
KNl9UJkeEHM,837040,843440,you're thinking you have one of the best  two-man punches in the history of the  nba you bring in james harden and
KNl9UJkeEHM,843440,848800,everybody  has the nets as a shoeing to win the nba  championship and potentially it could
KNl9UJkeEHM,848800,854480,all crumble it could all fall apart this  is why the nba offseason is just  incredible because these story lines
KNl9UJkeEHM,854480,860160,continue to come out mike dibble we see  you with that 20 bombs we'll get to you  in a sec he's just getting warm up
KNl9UJkeEHM,860160,865279,warmed up chase i have a feeling will kd  and kyrie return to the nets type y for
KNl9UJkeEHM,865279,872240,yes type in for no i'm typing my end for  no i think at least one is gone and i'll  add this as well chase if kyrie leaves
KNl9UJkeEHM,872240,877360,you gotta think the chances of kd want  now at least go up to 50 if not higher
KNl9UJkeEHM,877360,883839,unless he doesn't want to play with  kyrie any longer and he let that message  be known to the front office and this is
KNl9UJkeEHM,883839,889279,some type of leak that allows kyrie to  leave without it being as contentious
KNl9UJkeEHM,889279,894399,then kd comes back to brooklyn and they  try to surround him with some good  complimentary pieces yeah there's no
KNl9UJkeEHM,894399,900399,doubt about that why for yes and the  point here you can never rule anything  out it's the nba yes the nba offseason
KNl9UJkeEHM,900399,905600,anything is possible uh pilar says yes  saul says no nick says no hong kim says
KNl9UJkeEHM,905600,912079,no uh we got pilar back in there saying  yes uh dumer says no dustin says no tt
KNl9UJkeEHM,912079,918160,says yes uh valor says yes uh we got roy  garza saying no could okc go back to
KNl9UJkeEHM,918160,924959,okay or could kd go back to okc  that seems unlikely but they've got the  ammunition to do it there's no doubt
KNl9UJkeEHM,924959,932079,about that talk about a  uh a return story that uh would be uh  something else hey uh shout out to aura
KNl9UJkeEHM,932079,938560,for sponsoring our nba draft coverage  here uh tonight chase and i got going  with or a couple of weeks ago and
KNl9UJkeEHM,938560,944480,basically it's an all-in-one digital  safety tool online because hackers chase  they're everywhere

KNl9UJkeEHM,1011600,1018560,slash chat sports 14 day free trial all  right a couple super chats to catch up  on tilly what's up welcome man uh lakers
KNl9UJkeEHM,1018560,1023600,fans saying they're second rounder the  goat yet uh i haven't heard that but uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,1023600,1031199,they will be selecting tonight as the  lakers did buy a second round pick from  35 over orlando right orlando so i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,1031199,1037120,that's who they bought that pick from is  that right sam lakers okay uh they did  buy it from the magic appreciate the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1037120,1043520,super chat mike dibble in the house he's  on top of the super chat world right now  with the 20 bomb we got to take fireball
KNl9UJkeEHM,1043520,1048960,shots so i'll pour these out if you want  to read this for me yeah mike dibble the  legend the og he's backing better than
KNl9UJkeEHM,1048960,1054400,ever hey guys let's see if this year's  draft is as insane as last year's love  you guys can't wait to see what my
KNl9UJkeEHM,1054400,1061360,hornets do enjoy your shots and cheers  thank you brother really appreciate it  great to hear and see you again
KNl9UJkeEHM,1061360,1066559,we're going to pour up our fireball  shots here there you go my friend the  party officially getting started hour
KNl9UJkeEHM,1066559,1072240,and 41 until the nba draft then we'll be  live for both rounds talking about every  single pick and then we'll stay live
KNl9UJkeEHM,1072240,1079200,after the draft because we're a hashtag  built def we'll go ahead and talk about  the hornets too why not  a couple of top 15 picks here uh you
KNl9UJkeEHM,1079200,1084960,wonder if there are a team maybe chase  that could trade up into the top ten use  those two picks to get to five or six
KNl9UJkeEHM,1084960,1090640,maybe yeah uh that would be interesting  yeah because it really depends what that  trade partner wants and how the board
KNl9UJkeEHM,1090640,1096240,falls so if the board doesn't fall in  the favor of the hornets or if it falls  in a way in which they want to move up
KNl9UJkeEHM,1096240,1102320,and then another team let's say inside  the top 10  likes how favorably the board is falling
KNl9UJkeEHM,1102320,1108640,you trade up into the top 10 you give  away 13 and 15 you get your guy and then  the trade recipient is able to pick up
KNl9UJkeEHM,1108640,1115039,two rookies especially for a young  rebuilding team that could be a really  smart maneuver because this draft is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,1115039,1123159,little bit deep in the middle portion of  this first round  cheers mike dibble yeah appreciate the  20 dollars
KNl9UJkeEHM,1124400,1129679,and uh we'll continue with our nba draft  coverage uh by the way i i don't hear
KNl9UJkeEHM,1129679,1135520,you at all sam so i don't know if  there's a mic issue going on there we go  let's go to uh we got a big board
KNl9UJkeEHM,1135520,1141360,composite i know chase your board your  personal board's a little bit different  so you can kind of talk about the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1141360,1146880,differences the  the composite combining you know all the  big outlets esp and the ringer chet
KNl9UJkeEHM,1146880,1153280,holmgren's kind of in that top guy with  jabari smith and paulo van caro two and  three you're not as high on chat you're
KNl9UJkeEHM,1153280,1161760,more like six or seven with him yeah  chet is seventh on my board i went  jabari smith paolo bencaro jane ivey
KNl9UJkeEHM,1161760,1168400,and benedict matheran right there keegan  murray is also in that mix and then  shaden sharp above chet holmgren but
KNl9UJkeEHM,1168400,1174799,look he's so skilled as a big he's a  polarizing prospect i just worry about  the body type the guy is a seven footer
KNl9UJkeEHM,1174799,1180880,who weighs as much as me and i'm six  foot tall that's a problem how does he  fare down low and also i think what's
KNl9UJkeEHM,1180880,1187280,under talked about how does he deal with  the rigors of an nba schedule where  you're playing let's say 70 to 80 games
KNl9UJkeEHM,1187280,1192720,as a rookie dealing with the physicality  of it so a lot of the big boards out
KNl9UJkeEHM,1192720,1198080,there as this is a composite combining  all of them as harrison said have chet  holmgren at number one i disagree with
KNl9UJkeEHM,1198080,1203200,it he's about seven on my list i think  there are better players available and i  think that there are players whose
KNl9UJkeEHM,1203200,1209200,athleticism and the all-around traits  translate better to the nba right away  and in the long term jabari smith paolo
KNl9UJkeEHM,1209200,1214880,bencaro jay navi benedict matheran  keegan murray and shane sharp i think  they're going to be better nba players
KNl9UJkeEHM,1214880,1221039,long term than chet holmgren and when  you take these guys top five top ten  that's what you're envisioning real
KNl9UJkeEHM,1221039,1228159,quick before we kind of get deeper into  your board  who's the safest player on this top  eight and and take chat out of it we
KNl9UJkeEHM,1228159,1234000,just talked about him yeah safest guy  biggest wild card because i feel like  sharp is the biggest wild card in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1234000,1240640,top ten he is because nobody's seen any  tape on him going back to high school  and in the eybl circuit
KNl9UJkeEHM,1240640,1247280,he was incredible and from his junior  year to his senior year he sprouts from  six four to six six high level scoring
KNl9UJkeEHM,1247280,1254240,ability and he really impressed a lot of  teams and workouts but if he didn't play  any college basketball after  reclassifying to kentucky in january sat
KNl9UJkeEHM,1254240,1261039,out the entire year  it's a huge mystery because nobody's  seen him play an elite level of  competition now when people went to
KNl9UJkeEHM,1261039,1267440,lexington they'd watch kentucky practice  they'd see this guy shane sharp on the  side and say if he were to play at
KNl9UJkeEHM,1267440,1272880,kentucky this upcoming year he'd  probably be the number one pick but  again he's the biggest wild card sure
KNl9UJkeEHM,1272880,1280080,things i think paulo ben carroll because  i think he's going to be a really good  all-around player i think jay nivea is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,1280080,1285280,little bit less athletic than john  morant but has that similar game i think  those are two of the more sure things
KNl9UJkeEHM,1285280,1290320,keegan murray doesn't really have a  weakness either he's a big guy who runs  the floor just a little bit better than
KNl9UJkeEHM,1290320,1296240,al horford and he can shoot the three  iowa asked him to do everything with  mccaffrey and he was able to do it i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,1296240,1302400,mention johnny davis real quick here as  you get outside not about a really good  two-way player as well we got a super
KNl9UJkeEHM,1302400,1309600,chat here from cp uh appreciate the five  bucks uh which means we can talk about  your favorite team do you think kd is
KNl9UJkeEHM,1309600,1316840,posturing to get kyrie signed odd this  is reported by woj of all people he  usually doesn't bomb rumor without
KNl9UJkeEHM,1316840,1322480,purpose um let's be real though shums  and woage can be mouthpieces for agents
KNl9UJkeEHM,1322480,1328640,yes and mouthpieces for players so we  did talk about this earlier cp  appreciate the five dollar super chat
KNl9UJkeEHM,1328640,1335600,this could be a maneuver by kd to put  pressure on the organization if we don't  sign kyrie then i'm going to mull my
KNl9UJkeEHM,1335600,1341120,future with brooklyn and i could ask for  a trade if we bring him back then i want  to stay obviously because i signed that
KNl9UJkeEHM,1341120,1346480,extension last year obviously things  were different at that point but it  could be any of these jockeying moves we
KNl9UJkeEHM,1346480,1352320,see this happen all the time yeah and  look if you're kevin durant you're 34  years old yeah i mean or this upcoming
KNl9UJkeEHM,1352320,1357840,season and the window is closing just a  bit yeah and look he averaged 30 last  year i'm not saying he's going anywhere
KNl9UJkeEHM,1357840,1363840,but like  you only have so many seasons you can  play right i mean he's not gonna be  competing for championships when he's 42
KNl9UJkeEHM,1363840,1370720,years old he's probably got  four to you know three four five six  years of contending left and yeah that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,1370720,1376480,not that's more than one or two but if  you're kevin durant you know there's a  lot at stake here there's legacy on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1376480,1381679,line there's a lot of consideration here  considering the last three years in a  lot of ways have kind of been lost
KNl9UJkeEHM,1381679,1388240,opportunities if uh after making that  decision to leave golden state so we'll  see how that plays out we'll continue to
KNl9UJkeEHM,1388240,1394320,kind of keep you guys up with the rumor  mill and any other news that drops as  well we're an hour and 35 minutes until
KNl9UJkeEHM,1394320,1401440,the nba draft starts we just got a 10  super chat we'll get to that momentarily  as well closing in on 100 appreciate you
KNl9UJkeEHM,1401440,1406640,guys yeah 54 bucks away from 100 then  we'll take a company-wide shot like the  video
KNl9UJkeEHM,1406640,1413039,let's get to let's get let's double our  number 400 likes here we got 200 so far  let's get to 400 i think we can get to
KNl9UJkeEHM,1413039,1420240,400 likes i believe in you guys uh we  got over a thousand people watching 1100  people watching right now like the video
KNl9UJkeEHM,1420240,1427679,uh if everybody likes it we should uh  just zoom past that number of 400. so  hit that thumbs up icon if uh you guys
KNl9UJkeEHM,1427679,1432799,are ready for the draft i know chase and  i are ready to go as uh chase has been  studying up for the past couple of
KNl9UJkeEHM,1432799,1438720,months getting you guys ready all right  everyday jam 10 bucks what team do you
KNl9UJkeEHM,1438720,1443919,think made the makes the first surprise  pick maybe kings at four i have some  feelings they shot people and picked
KNl9UJkeEHM,1443919,1451120,matheran uh instead of ivy or murray  last year it didn't take long chase  scottie barnes at three yeah so that was
KNl9UJkeEHM,1451120,1457679,a big surprise and guess what that paid  off pretty well yeah so you look at the  first four picks here i think the magic  are gonna go jabari smith i think the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1457679,1463360,thunder will go with chet holmgren i see  paulo bencaro going to the rockets at  number three
KNl9UJkeEHM,1463360,1469679,it would not  surprise me if there's a scenario in  which jay knivey goes two through four i
KNl9UJkeEHM,1469679,1477200,think he's that good of a player so i  think jay navy is the name to keep an  eye on here so too is benedict matherin
KNl9UJkeEHM,1477200,1483760,i've always regarded him as one of my  favorite prospects other mock drafts had  him going early on
KNl9UJkeEHM,1483760,1490720,in the back half of this section right  here five through ten really he could be  four he could go fifth
KNl9UJkeEHM,1490720,1498480,so  jay navi benedict mather and maybe the  first splash and surprise in this draft  tonight uh slight mis uh misspoke by me
KNl9UJkeEHM,1498480,1504720,by the way uh barnes went fourth but uh  that was still earlier than uh pretty  much everybody yeah people had looked at
KNl9UJkeEHM,1504720,1510480,him maybe going six seven eight i  thought the raptors were gonna go jalen  suggs because they had just lost kyle
KNl9UJkeEHM,1510480,1516320,lowry but the point there is they  surprised a lot of people going spotty  scotty barnes and he was terrific this
KNl9UJkeEHM,1516320,1521679,past year there's always surprises you  just never know sacramento  a lot of people feel like the draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,1521679,1527120,starts here at number four chase there's  a lot of buzz that it's going to be  jabari smith palome or a chat home grim
KNl9UJkeEHM,1527120,1533279,bean carroll one two three uh the kings  have been taking calls the knicks among  the teams i think the pacers uh in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1533279,1538799,mix as well to potentially move up here  if you're sacramento let's say those  three teams or players come off the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1538799,1545679,board do you pick someone do you trade  the pick what are you doing if you're  the kings as you're continuing to try to
KNl9UJkeEHM,1545679,1551760,get out of the bottom of the western  conference new regime in sacramento mike  brown knew now the new head coach if i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,1551760,1558159,sacramento i'm trying to stockpile as  much young talent as possible now could  you look to trade away adeer and fox at
KNl9UJkeEHM,1558159,1564000,some point i will say this after the  tyreese halliburton trade he was  averaging nearly 30 points per game now
KNl9UJkeEHM,1564000,1569600,at the end of an nba season it can get a  little bit hairy it can get a little bit  tricky because a lot of teams are
KNl9UJkeEHM,1569600,1574880,arresting players but you trade away  dear and fox maybe that's something that  could be in the cards i think they
KNl9UJkeEHM,1574880,1581279,should build with a lot of the young  talent i think fox i think davion  mitchell they can work together you got
KNl9UJkeEHM,1581279,1587520,to find that wing that forward that  center so stay at four and get your guy  whether it be keegan murray jaden ivy
KNl9UJkeEHM,1587520,1594400,benedict matheran i don't think you can  go wrong with any of those elections  yeah take ivy that's the smart thing if  he doesn't go number three t for trade k
KNl9UJkeEHM,1594400,1599600,for keep  aladdin says trade so does brandon we're  going to get to the lady cam for that
KNl9UJkeEHM,1599600,1606159,roulette spin  in just a moment mirza says keep uh we  got uh chris saying keep mark he's

KNl9UJkeEHM,1726460,1730100,[Laughter]
KNl9UJkeEHM,1735840,1742880,here we go we got another tin remember  we just got another ten dollars stay  with us mitch uh we'll get back for a
KNl9UJkeEHM,1742880,1748080,second  troy daniels with the tinder oh troy  daniels is back troy daniels what to do
KNl9UJkeEHM,1748080,1753520,man jazz no picks uh yeah that's  unfortunate do they make a move to get a  pick in the second round and who do you
KNl9UJkeEHM,1753520,1759840,see them potentially drafting with that  pick or do they stay pat in the draft  i don't view them as a team making a
KNl9UJkeEHM,1759840,1765360,move i don't really either and i'm also  not sure what the direction is of the  utah jets are they going to trade away
KNl9UJkeEHM,1765360,1770960,donovan mitchell they lost their  coaching quinn snyder will they trade  away rudy gobert will both go bear and d
KNl9UJkeEHM,1770960,1776399,mitch get traded away a lot of questions  with that roster ideally they do have a  first round pick right but they don't in
KNl9UJkeEHM,1776399,1783039,this scenario tonight and i think it  cost a little bit too much to get that  who knows though miami heat potentially
KNl9UJkeEHM,1783039,1789360,interested in donovan mitchell could a  first round pick and players go to utah  for dmich tonight
KNl9UJkeEHM,1789360,1794480,the chatter on that front has been  somewhat silent if it happens that would  be insane but i don't really think the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1794480,1801279,jazz really need to  trade up into the second round they do  need some three and d wings they need to
KNl9UJkeEHM,1801279,1807760,get better defensively big man depth if  they trade into the second round maybe  it's a player like kofi coburn and one
KNl9UJkeEHM,1807760,1813039,of the big men if they trade away rudy  gobert or if they know or have an idea
KNl9UJkeEHM,1813039,1818960,that gobert is going to be dealt maybe  they dropped the big in the second one  step number one you got to get a head  coach yeah you got to get a head coach
KNl9UJkeEHM,1818960,1825360,first before you decide on person danny  ainge is running things right yeah got  to make a move there all right we'll  bring mitch back in here another
KNl9UJkeEHM,1825360,1832480,roulette wheel coming up uh he's shaking  no he's not ready to go that's me saying  hello
KNl9UJkeEHM,1832559,1839039,so we already spun the roulette wheel  and  not only does  do we have beer drinking we got some
KNl9UJkeEHM,1839039,1845360,shots as well but i've always been told  the best thing to help get over a  hangover is to eat mac and cheese ice
KNl9UJkeEHM,1845360,1850399,cream so what we're gonna do here is  this we got marshall green he's gonna  eat some mac and cheese ice cream that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,1850399,1856559,right literally been in our freezer i'm  not kidding you probably last year's nba  dress
KNl9UJkeEHM,1856559,1863679,marsh eat it it's probably the last  thing that i didn't want for kai soto  for kai type kai in the chat
KNl9UJkeEHM,1863679,1869519,so bad how is it beautiful beautiful  all right guys back to you all right i
KNl9UJkeEHM,1869519,1875840,appreciate it uh let's get to some other  rumors chase uh because the beauty of  the nba draft is really that's kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,1875840,1883600,when the trade rumors start the free  agency buzz starts to kick in john  collins trade rumors really have been
KNl9UJkeEHM,1883600,1890320,throughout his entire career they've  ramped back up because about a month ago  the hawks uh a report leaked that they
KNl9UJkeEHM,1890320,1896799,could trade anybody not named trae young  colin specifically trade rumors around  him have been ramping up uh kings and
KNl9UJkeEHM,1896799,1902159,spurs have been linked to him what do  you think happens with atlanta what are  they doing this off season they're in
KNl9UJkeEHM,1902159,1908000,such a weird spot two years ago they  make that magical and surprising run to  the eastern conference finals and trae
KNl9UJkeEHM,1908000,1913039,young really broke out as one of the  best young superstars in this league
KNl9UJkeEHM,1913039,1918960,coming out of oklahoma i compared him to  steph curry because he has a very  similar game now obviously long term i
KNl9UJkeEHM,1918960,1925440,think steph he's an all-time great  arguably the best player of this  generation if he unseated lebron james i
KNl9UJkeEHM,1925440,1931200,don't think that trey young is going to  be that but he's coming off the best  season of his career and you can build  around him because he has special
KNl9UJkeEHM,1931200,1937200,scoring ability is john collins that  co-star for trey young i'm not sure he  plays the four
KNl9UJkeEHM,1937200,1942960,and he's a really solid player you look  at what he's done throughout his career  16 and a half points per game eight
KNl9UJkeEHM,1942960,1948480,rebounds he continues to get a little  bit better as a three-point shooter  always been pretty efficient around the
KNl9UJkeEHM,1948480,1954480,rim high flyer good defender because he  can protect the rim and protect the  paint and has good instincts with
KNl9UJkeEHM,1954480,1959760,blocking shots and he can get up and  down the floor in a blink is he the  player that
KNl9UJkeEHM,1959760,1966559,works long term aside from trae young  that's the big question that the hawks  have to figure out and if he's not you
KNl9UJkeEHM,1966559,1973200,can really get a nice package back for  him and then give trey young some better  complimentary pieces if you don't think
KNl9UJkeEHM,1973200,1978240,that they can fit long term i also  wonder too and i've thought this for a  while and you guys can get your votes in
KNl9UJkeEHM,1978240,1983279,on this how many trades on draft night  three four five six let us know uh and
KNl9UJkeEHM,1983279,1990559,the mavericks one doesn't count because  that happened last week technically it  doesn't happen until tonight but  i kind of wonder like did clint capela
KNl9UJkeEHM,1990559,1996880,and john collins can they play together  like  this almost feels like the miles  turner's a bonus thing to me where it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,1996880,2002240,like in today's nba sure collins plays  the four but i almost wonder on like a
KNl9UJkeEHM,2002240,2009519,really good team if he's just not your  five where he's 6 10 he's bouncy he can  rim protect like do him and capela fit
KNl9UJkeEHM,2009519,2015600,next to each other for a contending team  i don't know you know going into this  year if i would have told you that the
KNl9UJkeEHM,2015600,2021600,celtics would be starting al horford and  robert williams you probably would have  said that's a little bit clunky so rare
KNl9UJkeEHM,2021600,2027679,instances though in which that actually  works and i thought imei adoka did a  great job of mixing and matching them
KNl9UJkeEHM,2027679,2033919,together staggering their minutes they  also had some really good players around  them so that's one of the situations and
KNl9UJkeEHM,2033919,2039440,case points where it actually does work  but it's hard to get that figured out  with that four and five spot not getting
KNl9UJkeEHM,2039440,2045200,a little bit clunky seeing seven in  there four a couple votes coming in here  everyday jam with the super chat is
KNl9UJkeEHM,2045200,2050638,we're under 90 minutes away from the  giraffe getting underway and the magic  getting on the clock everyone shouldn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,2050638,2056000,be allowed to say kai soto until he is  picked when the draft starts well
KNl9UJkeEHM,2056000,2063440,you heard the man he he doesn't want me  to talk about his favorite team but he  says we can't say kai so here's the deal
KNl9UJkeEHM,2063440,2068560,we can't say the filipino superstar's  name anymore until we get to a thousand
KNl9UJkeEHM,2068560,2075280,likes we're at 334  if we get to a thousand we can say it  again but you guys hey you can't say it
KNl9UJkeEHM,2075280,2080720,that's just the rules so i like the  video setting the rules here i don't i  don't make the rules i just enforce them
KNl9UJkeEHM,2080720,2086800,that's uh that's how it goes here so uh  a lot of you guys are breaking the rules  but uh chase and i will not be saying
KNl9UJkeEHM,2086800,2093040,his name until we get to a thousand  likes and i know a lot of you guys are a  big fan and yeah we have to drink every
KNl9UJkeEHM,2093040,2098400,time the name slips out of our mouth so  i may start saying it because i'm a  little thirsty here but uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,2098400,2105599,can't say  you know who until we get a thousand  likes so like the video if we get to a  thousand we'll unleash our uh soto
KNl9UJkeEHM,2105599,2110800,content all right max's podcast go check  that out what do the nuggets do in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,2110800,2117599,draft uh so do you think what 30th pick  uh  yeah yeah after that trade with the
KNl9UJkeEHM,2117599,2124000,oh 21 too that's right 21 and 30 after  that trade with the thunder so you look  at the nuggets draft profile here two
KNl9UJkeEHM,2124000,2130400,picks in the first round 21 and 30.  don't have a second round pick last year  they drafted bones highland who
KNl9UJkeEHM,2130400,2136880,i think is a really valuable young asset  impressed me at moments last year liked  him this time last year a year ago
KNl9UJkeEHM,2136880,2144400,coming out of vcu high energy player  with some really intriguing scoring  potential but draft needs and free
KNl9UJkeEHM,2144400,2150480,agency needs two a wings a backup big  and bench scoring think about it you get  back jamal murray and the entire
KNl9UJkeEHM,2150480,2156640,complexion of this team changes you also  get back michael porter jr who if it  wasn't for that back injury coming out
KNl9UJkeEHM,2156640,2162400,of mizzou he may have been the number  one pick in the draft back a couple  years ago you get back murray and porter
KNl9UJkeEHM,2162400,2167680,your team becomes pretty dangerous in  addition to the reigning two-time nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,2167680,2174560,mvp and the joker you don't really need  much but there are going to be some  pretty solid players right there if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,2174560,2179599,want a future paul millsap it's ej  liddell  if you want to take a chance on a guy at
KNl9UJkeEHM,2179599,2186800,number 30 you kind of have your  options at some good guards who could  fall like if kennedy chandler is there i
KNl9UJkeEHM,2186800,2193280,like him as a playmaker or you go  wing like a jalen williams out of santa  clara if he falls that far yeah we can
KNl9UJkeEHM,2193280,2200480,kind of b-roll through this best  available and get to some of the later  guys some guys that maybe denver could  look at in the the 20s and obviously
KNl9UJkeEHM,2200480,2205760,they're at 30 as well uh obviously these  are some of the top prospects uh but i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,2205760,2211040,with you with denver michael porter jr  people forget in the bubble and then
KNl9UJkeEHM,2211040,2217359,early in the season following he was  kind of becoming an all-star and then he  gets hurt again yeah uh obviously that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,2217359,2224000,going to be a concern movement there  were huge red flags with the back coming  out we've seen him play at a high level  in the nba is my point like if he could
KNl9UJkeEHM,2224000,2229520,get healthy he can be that guy  also murray i mean the dude was dropping
KNl9UJkeEHM,2229520,2234800,50 point burgers in the bubble and  played great the year after before he  tore the acl so you get those two pieces
KNl9UJkeEHM,2234800,2240160,back you draft a contributor or two i  think denver can be right there in the  mix to be a top four seed in the west
KNl9UJkeEHM,2240160,2246800,again next year so let's see what  happens on that front can we get to 310  000 subs by the start of the draft by

KNl9UJkeEHM,2382720,2388720,good job by you and subscribing all  right uh let's talk at og anadobia chase  there's been some trade buzz around them
KNl9UJkeEHM,2388720,2394320,and chris haynes reported that the  trailblazers could be interested they of  course already traded for jeremy grant
KNl9UJkeEHM,2394320,2399760,couple of pre-draft trades that went  down that we can break down here in a  moment as well uh but oh gee if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,2399760,2406480,could add him as well you get two  perimeter  elite perimeter defenders next to damian
KNl9UJkeEHM,2406480,2412480,lillard and a couple of guys that can  score as well i think this is a counter  to what the warriors have and how to try
KNl9UJkeEHM,2412480,2417520,to stop the warriors in the western  conference get a bunch of athletes get a  bunch of length and then you have that
KNl9UJkeEHM,2417520,2423440,elite scorer and damien lillard now i'm  talking about this length because they  already traded for jeremy grant and gave
KNl9UJkeEHM,2423440,2428720,up a 2025 first round pick via milwaukee  and if giannis continues to stay with
KNl9UJkeEHM,2428720,2434079,the bucks that pick is going to be in  the back half of the first round so  basically you didn't give up much for
KNl9UJkeEHM,2434079,2440720,jeremy grant here are the trade  specifics but you bring in jeremy grant  you find a way to land ogn and obi who i
KNl9UJkeEHM,2440720,2446880,think is an emerging offensive player  and already an elite defensive player  i'd give up number seven for him if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,2446880,2454480,think that that helps you try to win  right now now you have anthony simons as  well if you stay at seven do you go with
KNl9UJkeEHM,2454480,2460800,the shade and sharp if he falls do you  reach a little bit for a big because  that's an area of need i think you trade
KNl9UJkeEHM,2460800,2467920,away number seven for ogn and obi a very  good two-way player he helps you on the  offensive then lifts you defensively
KNl9UJkeEHM,2467920,2473680,because you know damien lillard is not  really a defensive staple no grant and  obi
KNl9UJkeEHM,2473680,2480000,defensively at the wings you find a  center like a deandre ayton moe bomb  let's go make me the gm mo obama if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,2480000,2486000,want to save some cheaper options yeah  no doubt about it who won this trade i  think it's clearly portland i mean i
KNl9UJkeEHM,2486000,2492880,thought i thought detroit would get more  here to be honest i mean they were  talking there were rumors six eight  months ago chase that if the pistons are
KNl9UJkeEHM,2492880,2498160,going to trade grant they wanted two  first-round picks not only do they only  get one it's three years from now and
KNl9UJkeEHM,2498160,2504640,it's from milwaukee which is going to be  in the 20s uh i think i think detroit  settled here if i'm being honest d-e-t
KNl9UJkeEHM,2504640,2510720,for the pistons por for the blazers now  on the flip side if you're detroit you  clear the cap you're going young anyway
KNl9UJkeEHM,2510720,2516319,i get that i thought they could have  gotten more though at the end of the day  there's also the pick swap there in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,2516319,2523200,second round but if you're portland you  move down from 36 to 46 in round two  that's semantics that's not we we know
KNl9UJkeEHM,2523200,2528480,how the second round of the nba draft  goes it's a crap shoot anyway uh let's  see what the folks are saying about who
KNl9UJkeEHM,2528480,2534160,won this trade michael says portland  brandon says portland uh we got uh let's
KNl9UJkeEHM,2534160,2540400,see uh steve stewie says portland  detroit from steven uh i think it was  pretty clearly the portland trailblazers
KNl9UJkeEHM,2540400,2547119,couple other trades that went down more  minor moves chase uh lakers do move into  the draft so they'll pick at 35 tonight
KNl9UJkeEHM,2547119,2552960,uh magic get a 2028 second round pick so  some kid who's uh in about seventh grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,2552960,2559040,right now uh will turn into that  selection and then uh cash  considerations as well and then uh the
KNl9UJkeEHM,2559040,2564240,cavs and kings uh make a move uh  cleveland gets the 49th pick and then uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,2564240,2570319,sacramento receives the rights to sasha  uh vesnikov and then um cash  considerations yeah a couple minor
KNl9UJkeEHM,2570319,2576400,trades uh but wanted to uh  leave those or bring those uh to you  because that does impact the draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,2576400,2582400,tonight i think for the lakers that's a  really good trade you get to 35 you  could have your collection of christian
KNl9UJkeEHM,2582400,2588880,koloko bryce mcgowan's maybe a player  like kennedy chandler i don't think he  falls that far patrick baldwin jr was
KNl9UJkeEHM,2588880,2596319,one of the top recruits in high school  two years ago went to milwaukee to play  for a little champion fall maybe uh yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,2596319,2602319,he could maybe peyton watson was the  number one high school recruit before  barely playing at ucla i don't think he
KNl9UJkeEHM,2602319,2609680,fits the timeline andrew nemhard is a  veteran player for gonzaga who could go  there jake laravia out of wake forest
KNl9UJkeEHM,2609680,2615440,kendall brown  like the point here you get the 35  you're right out of the cusp of that
KNl9UJkeEHM,2615440,2622480,first round some good players could fall  your way yeah there's no doubt uh oh i  can't read this
KNl9UJkeEHM,2622480,2627760,message the super chat but it says go  blank soto
KNl9UJkeEHM,2627760,2633359,can't say his first name those are the  rules man we got to get to a thousand  400 more likes than we can say his name

KNl9UJkeEHM,2979520,2985760,celtics need to do to beat the  warriors chase to me
KNl9UJkeEHM,2985760,2991440,this one is more of  i think a lot of it is internal i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,2991440,2998720,jason tatum needs to take that next step  which he's taking a step every year so i  fully expect him to take another one but
KNl9UJkeEHM,2998720,3005200,didn't play great in the finals shot in  the mid 30s from the field i don't know  if there was some fatigue i think the  warriors deserve a lot of credit through
KNl9UJkeEHM,3005200,3011920,some different guys adam but i think he  needs to take that next step to be a  surefire top five player in the league
KNl9UJkeEHM,3011920,3018319,and then you know you add the minor  pieces around them they've got a good  core they just need to run it back and  you know play a little bit better in
KNl9UJkeEHM,3018319,3023440,those big moments they have an excellent  roster they were up 2-1 on the golden  state warriors and then the warriors
KNl9UJkeEHM,3023440,3030400,just really started to turn it on and  play excellent basketball on both sides  of the floor when you look at the  celtics and jayson tatum to be specific
KNl9UJkeEHM,3030400,3036160,i think he's a star he's not yet a  superstar and i thought throughout the  finals he got flustered he was bothered
KNl9UJkeEHM,3036160,3041760,defensively by what golden state was  doing led by andrew wiggins who i  thought played tremendous defense and if
KNl9UJkeEHM,3041760,3047839,it wasn't for steph curry going off i  think andrew wiggins would have won nba  finals mvp tatum was worn down a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,3047839,3054319,bit i'm not sure any player had the  workload that he had throughout the  entire playoffs and you think about the
KNl9UJkeEHM,3054319,3060640,sample size for boston throughout the  postseason the four game series was a  sweep of brooklyn but it was a tough
KNl9UJkeEHM,3060640,3066800,series those games are really close  seven games against milwaukee seven  games against miami and when it came
KNl9UJkeEHM,3066800,3072160,time for the nba finals i just thought  that jt was a little bit tired he got  flustered and bothered defensively by
KNl9UJkeEHM,3072160,3078319,the warriors and andrew wiggins and i  also think because of that lost his  confidence to a certain degree now a
KNl9UJkeEHM,3078319,3084079,loss like that and a performance like  that where steph curry had a better  percentage shooting from three-point
KNl9UJkeEHM,3084079,3090079,distance than tatum did from the field  could motivate a young player like that  and let's be real he's less than 25
KNl9UJkeEHM,3090079,3095119,years old he is a budding superstar who  right now is a star but not superstar
KNl9UJkeEHM,3095119,3101760,status yet we do have a celtics youtube  channel it's youtube.comceltxtv  will scott one of our new hosts here at

KNl9UJkeEHM,3357760,3363040,draft uh  which dropped earlier this morning yeah  this is what i think is going to happen
KNl9UJkeEHM,3363040,3369680,not what i would do i wouldn't draft  chat in the top five but this is what  i'm going with jabari smith number one
KNl9UJkeEHM,3369680,3375599,to the orlando magic chat number two to  okc bancaro to houston gives jalen green
KNl9UJkeEHM,3375599,3382559,a really good player on that front court  with alperin shen goon jaden ivey to the  sacramento kings word is he doesn't want
KNl9UJkeEHM,3382559,3388319,to go there if on the kinks i still take  him because he's a little bit less  athletic than john morant very similar
KNl9UJkeEHM,3388319,3394880,game benedict mather into the pistons  and then you look 6 through 10 here  maybe some teams decide to reach
KNl9UJkeEHM,3394880,3401440,maybe some teams take a big swing  i kind of think the board falls  something like this shane sharp keegan
KNl9UJkeEHM,3401440,3406880,murray dyson daniels jalen duran and  johnny davis and then aj griffin number
KNl9UJkeEHM,3406880,3413119,11 to the new york knicks he's like an  offensive jimmy butler with the three  ball but he is a traffic cone
KNl9UJkeEHM,3413119,3418960,defensively a little bit of a problem  but if he goes to a knicks team it's  another dookie to team up with rj
KNl9UJkeEHM,3418960,3426400,barrett and cam reddish and a guy who i  think can be a very good score at the  nba level uzman zhang big wild card
KNl9UJkeEHM,3426400,3432079,athletically he can do some special  things has to be a more efficient  shooter jeremy sohan one of my favorite
KNl9UJkeEHM,3432079,3437760,players in this draft 13 to charlotte  here i think that he can be like a  draymond green ben simmons at the four
KNl9UJkeEHM,3437760,3442880,type of player and impact the game in a  plethora of ways ochai obagi number 14
KNl9UJkeEHM,3442880,3448319,to the cleveland cavaliers a win now  player for a win now team then mark  williams number 15 to the charlotte
KNl9UJkeEHM,3448319,3454960,hornets 16 through 20 here tary easton  jalen williams is a fast riser out of
KNl9UJkeEHM,3454960,3460960,santa clara the level of competition was  low but he dogged chet holmgren in a  couple of games this year in a couple of
KNl9UJkeEHM,3460960,3467200,instances it was really impressive  beating him off the dribble ej liddell  another riser going 18 to chicago
KNl9UJkeEHM,3467200,3473680,another win now player for a win now  team ty ty washington love the smarts at  the point guard spot to minnesota to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,3473680,3480880,the backup point guard and maybe future  long-term starter especially if they  trade away d'angelo russell nicola yovic
KNl9UJkeEHM,3480880,3488640,out of mega basket 20 to the san antonio  spurs and then malachi branham bryce  mcgowan's jaden hardy dalen terry walker
KNl9UJkeEHM,3488640,3495760,kessler  21-25 walker kessler a backup big for  san antonio pretty solid led the nation
KNl9UJkeEHM,3495760,3503040,in blocks last year and was the best  defensive big in the country a year ago  for auburn 26 to 30 to round out my
KNl9UJkeEHM,3503040,3509760,final mock draft blake wesley he's a guy  who could go in the teens he could even  go in the second round a raw product who
KNl9UJkeEHM,3509760,3515440,has a boatload of potential kennedy  chandler gives me tyrese maxi flashes a  little bit undersized but dynamic with
KNl9UJkeEHM,3515440,3521040,finishing around the rim christian  coloco might be the best shot blocker in  this class out of arizona if james
KNl9UJkeEHM,3521040,3527359,wiseman is hurt he makes a lot of sense  here marjon beauchamp out of the  g-league ignite a long player who i want
KNl9UJkeEHM,3527359,3533920,to see be more consistent but is an  awesome athlete and can defend and then  christian brown out of kansas number 30
KNl9UJkeEHM,3533920,3539280,to denver he could slip out of the first  round i think that would be stupid i  think he's another player who can impact
KNl9UJkeEHM,3539280,3544319,games early as a rookie good defense  very good athlete has a corner three
KNl9UJkeEHM,3544319,3551119,down and won a national championship  last year i do like the winning pedigree  there's chase's rapid fire mock draft we

KNl9UJkeEHM,3638000,3643680,yeah so in my mock i had ty ty  washington the point guard out of  kentucky going to minnesota what happens
KNl9UJkeEHM,3643680,3649680,with d'angelo russell do they hold on to  him do they trade him away  if i'm the tea wolves with this new
KNl9UJkeEHM,3649680,3656319,regime you got the head coach right you  got anthony edwards right carl anthony  towns is a dog i like some of the bench
KNl9UJkeEHM,3656319,3663280,pieces on that team as well i don't  think it makes sense to have d-lo  because i think it's just too much of a  ball dominant player and frankly i want
KNl9UJkeEHM,3663280,3670640,to see more from anthony edwards this  guy is a walking 30 point player per  night i believe in the long term and
KNl9UJkeEHM,3670640,3676480,carl anthony towns has an excellent big  who gives you 25 and 10. so you get a  backup point guard right now in taitai
KNl9UJkeEHM,3676480,3682799,washington who can maybe become a future  starter wouldn't hate malachi branham  out of ohio state jaden hardy if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,3682799,3688720,want a hyper score coming in off the  bench does tori easton fall if you want  some depth pieces at that forward spot
KNl9UJkeEHM,3688720,3696000,dalen terry's a good wing blake wesley  is a young player who you can develop ej  liddell winning player year one maybe he
KNl9UJkeEHM,3696000,3702160,falls to 19 as well some options  they do  have some needs on the roster two way
KNl9UJkeEHM,3702160,3707440,wings front court help and bench scoring  so if you go bench scoring jaden hardy  is that microwave score who reminds me a
KNl9UJkeEHM,3707440,3713200,lot of cam time i'm with you i'm trading  delo i want anthony edwards to have the  ball in his hands at most times and you
KNl9UJkeEHM,3713200,3718960,just it's this awkward thing where they  split possessions and edwards is the  better player so i'm trading dilo if i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,3718960,3725359,minnesota jimmy productions two dollars  i think the nfl draft is better than the  nba draft they're both great man great

KNl9UJkeEHM,3743119,3749920,i think the off season for the nba is  more drama filled yes just because of  the personalities the player movement
KNl9UJkeEHM,3749920,3755520,more spending and lucrative spending  the better league for the regular season
KNl9UJkeEHM,3755520,3761039,no question the nfl i take the super  bowl over the nba finals the numbers  certainly indicate that when you look at

KNl9UJkeEHM,3921760,3928480,way kind of took uh some of the lists  from some of the big outlets out there  chet jabari smith paolo bencaro
KNl9UJkeEHM,3928480,3934880,jaden ivy those would kind of been the  consistent uh consensus top four and  then  shaden sharp keegan murray you know it
KNl9UJkeEHM,3934880,3940240,kind of gets a little muddy here chase  uh after kind of the big guys at the top
KNl9UJkeEHM,3940240,3946640,who intrigues you the most when you kind  of get into this second tier on this  list it's benedict mather and i think  he's gonna be a really good nba player
KNl9UJkeEHM,3946640,3952720,for a really long time why is that he  can score he's got a nice clean  comfortable stroke from distance he's an
KNl9UJkeEHM,3952720,3958880,elite level athlete who i think is going  to develop over time both him and jabari  smith they need to work on their handles
KNl9UJkeEHM,3958880,3965280,just a bit but of that grouping of four  i think benedict matheran for me is a  top five prospect and i love his
KNl9UJkeEHM,3965280,3971760,long-term ability here you look at  johnny davis arguably the best scorer in  college basketball last year dyson
KNl9UJkeEHM,3971760,3978319,daniels makes all of the right winning  plays reminds me a lot of derrick white  in that regard but his shot and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,3978319,3985359,efficiency of it was bad jeremy sohan  puts his fingerprints on the game in a  variety of ways jalen durant is uber
KNl9UJkeEHM,3985359,3991839,athletic but i might like christian  coloco out of arizona as a better pure  shot blocker but athletically he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,3991839,3996960,awesome he could go nine to the san  antonio spurs there's been a little a  lot of buzz there yeah so we'll see uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,3996960,4004480,how that ends up shaking out uh 52  minutes until the magic are on the clock  and uh we'll see how uh this top of the

KNl9UJkeEHM,4287760,4293040,chase sees uh we'll talk about that team  so how about this chase at the 47 minute
KNl9UJkeEHM,4293040,4300159,mark look down in the chat and then uh  you can uh the first team you see that's  who we'll talk about so 10 seconds here
KNl9UJkeEHM,4300159,4305280,as uh y'all continue to shout out your  team if you want your team to be the one  chosen five seconds better get it in
KNl9UJkeEHM,4305280,4311280,three  two  and one all right go  clippers that's who i saw too actually
KNl9UJkeEHM,4311280,4317360,yeah you want to go after kyrie irving  yeah kyrie irving might be out in  brooklyn and for the clippers yule and
KNl9UJkeEHM,4317360,4322400,kyrie they immediately become maybe the  most interesting team in the western  conference and that's with the phoenix
KNl9UJkeEHM,4322400,4327840,suns that's with the golden state  warriors the denver nuggets getting back  jamal murray the portland trailblazers
KNl9UJkeEHM,4327840,4334159,already trading for jeremy grant getting  damien lowlard back maybe wheeling and  dealing for ogn and obi you need to play
KNl9UJkeEHM,4334159,4340880,making guard kyrie irving would fulfill  that need front court help  because you traded away
KNl9UJkeEHM,4340880,4346880,serge ibaka  and zubats is really just okay maybe  better
KNl9UJkeEHM,4346880,4353199,he's also a free agent also a free agent  if they don't bring him back depth as  well but you have kawhi liner coming off
KNl9UJkeEHM,4353199,4359760,the acl paul george and kyrie irving  luke canard as your shooter  that's a really good team right there
KNl9UJkeEHM,4359760,4366560,terrence mann as part of that equation  as well that could be a deep roster and  one of the best coaches in the league in
KNl9UJkeEHM,4366560,4373199,tyron lou i just have  concerns that  the big three era has kind of come and
KNl9UJkeEHM,4373199,4379040,gone  i think the best way to build a team now  is with two superstars and really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,4379040,4385360,pieces around because if you get kyrie a  lot of those guys you just talked about  they have to go away yeah to adam what
KNl9UJkeEHM,4385360,4391360,did the lakers do this year they went in  on russ and i get it kyrie's better than  russ i get all that but they had no
KNl9UJkeEHM,4391360,4397199,depth no good role players basically  outside of malik monk he was the only  reliable one a little bit of carmelo but
KNl9UJkeEHM,4397199,4402560,if you're the clippers yeah kawhi kyrie  paul george that's lethal what's the  rest of the roster marcus morris has
KNl9UJkeEHM,4402560,4408560,gone in this scenario you can't pay him  you can't resign nick batum in that  scenario he plays kiro reggie jackson
KNl9UJkeEHM,4408560,4413600,probably has to go to make the money  he's making a lot of money sure that big  three's gonna score a bunch of points
KNl9UJkeEHM,4413600,4420159,but  you're gonna get shredded when they're  out of the game so it's intriguing i'm  not saying i wouldn't consider it but
KNl9UJkeEHM,4420159,4426880,there are a lot of things uh you do have  to consider if you are any team that  would pursue kyrie irving if you already
KNl9UJkeEHM,4426880,4432640,have two stars all right we'll play this  game one more time here by the way the  clippers don't have a first round pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,4432640,4438239,so not a ton going on for them in the  draft i think they pick it 43 in the  second round something like that uh i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,4438239,4443600,play the game this time so at 44 30 the  first team i see
KNl9UJkeEHM,4443600,4449840,in the chat that is who we'll talk about  so continue to shout out your favorite  team and uh we will uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,4449840,4456000,talk about a team here in seven seconds  here as i get a sip in cheers homies
KNl9UJkeEHM,4456000,4462159,bottoms up appreciate everybody tuning  in here all right  i saw clippers again but we'll talk
KNl9UJkeEHM,4462159,4467440,about the lakers that's the next team i  saw  uh  kind of similar right for the lakers
KNl9UJkeEHM,4467440,4472719,they do have a second round pick now uh  chase they traded in pick number 35
KNl9UJkeEHM,4472719,4478560,but you could also say some similar  things there's been chatter that kyree  and lebron could want to sync up again
KNl9UJkeEHM,4478560,4484800,obviously you'd have to move russell  westbrook but talk about the lakers  again what could they do at 35 and maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,4484800,4490560,uh if you like or dislike the idea of  getting kyrie on board i like the idea  of getting kyrie on board if you can get
KNl9UJkeEHM,4490560,4497360,rid of russell westbrook because that  immediately helps out your team it makes  you more dangerous and it's a clear  upgrade because russell westbrook is on
KNl9UJkeEHM,4497360,4504159,the downward trajectory on the back nine  of his career he's losing just a tad of  athleticism my big thing with russ it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,4504159,4509440,his lack of decision making the  maddening decisions and mistakes that he  makes especially in the crucial moments
KNl9UJkeEHM,4509440,4516400,of the game  can't shoot the three they need  three-point shooters and floor spacers  on that team and ball handlers who can
KNl9UJkeEHM,4516400,4522000,create and get a bucket whether it be at  the rack or from the outside to help out
KNl9UJkeEHM,4522000,4528239,lebron james and you have to figure okay  we have two injury-riddled players the  last couple of years in lebron and
KNl9UJkeEHM,4528239,4535199,anthony davis and i know kyrie irving  doesn't really help that because of his  lack of availability but you have those
KNl9UJkeEHM,4535199,4542239,three players and when they do play  maybe it's 50 games 50 60 games of that  trio is really good then you round out
KNl9UJkeEHM,4542239,4548080,the roster because you can always expect  the lakers to be aggressive so i just  think it improves the lakers and you're
KNl9UJkeEHM,4548080,4554400,trying to win a championship over the  next year or two this is not a long-term  play so trade for kyrie as for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,4554400,4560080,drafty at number 35 you can get your  hands on a really good player christian  brown a three-point shooter if he hits
KNl9UJkeEHM,4560080,4565920,rocks who can defend those are the types  of guys that you need  while bringing in kyrie helps you right
KNl9UJkeEHM,4565920,4571760,now and it is a short-term play you have  to combine that with kind of what the  warriors are doing competing right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,4571760,4577600,but in the playoffs jonathan kaminga and  moses moody weren't even playing james  wiseman was injured and jordan poole
KNl9UJkeEHM,4577600,4584480,didn't get as many minutes in the  playoffs as he did in the regular season  but you have that influx of youth but
KNl9UJkeEHM,4584480,4591920,also the veterans as well it's a couple  super chats uh we got bronson berry  let's go raptors hey from canada listen
KNl9UJkeEHM,4591920,4600320,um  g'day mate i got a lot of respect for  that organization oh yeah they're a  talent factory uh noelle f star isabel
KNl9UJkeEHM,4600320,4605600,uh appreciate the 25 pinot filipino  dollars uh toppy uh baldwin a video game
KNl9UJkeEHM,4605600,4610719,controller oh is  a super sticker appreciate that uh julie
KNl9UJkeEHM,4610719,4616880,enriquez let's go kai get the kai chant  going in the chat uh appreciate all the
KNl9UJkeEHM,4616880,4622159,support from the philippines get the  guys going get the kais going uh and uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,4622159,4629199,hey we've been we've been  plugging out as much kaisoto content as  anybody on youtube so hopefully get
KNl9UJkeEHM,4629199,4635679,strapped to make us look smart and if  not we'll talk about him as an undrafted  free agent yeah you best believe that uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,4635679,4642159,got another super chat that's actually  in the ten dollar category so uh that'll  be another roulette spin so someone at
KNl9UJkeEHM,4642159,4649600,the lidicam will have to get ready to go  uh skinner b uh we'll get to the  roulette span in a moment but uh we can
KNl9UJkeEHM,4649600,4655120,get caught up on uh the reports from  earlier uh sam they're not ready to go  out there we'll go to them in a minute
KNl9UJkeEHM,4655120,4661440,uh appreciate that he says for sure  number one pick uh  i think you're gonna be disappointed but
KNl9UJkeEHM,4661440,4666800,uh hey i'm rooting for the kid to get  drafted he's got  he's got a darn nation behind him yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,4666800,4672960,maybe the number one udfa pick hey  you don't think a lot of teams would  want to sign him and get those jersey
KNl9UJkeEHM,4672960,4678000,sales going you best believe they would  all right uh let's circle back to the uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,4678000,4684560,kyrie and durant stuff uh chase because  the report from earlier is that durant's  monitoring what's going on because kyrie
KNl9UJkeEHM,4684560,4690960,could be uh could be moving out shams  woj they each had uh reports woj  mentioned some teams that kyrie would be
KNl9UJkeEHM,4690960,4696320,interested in he mentioned the clippers  lakers knicks heat mavs and sixers if  you're just joining us we've kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,4696320,4702080,broken this down a few times but a lot  of more uh viewers watching now  how do you think this plays out you
KNl9UJkeEHM,4702080,4708560,think something happens tonight is it  between now and i think it has to be  between now really in the 29th because
KNl9UJkeEHM,4708560,4715520,that's when kyrie has to decide on the  player option so you got five six days  here uh before uh we kind of find out
KNl9UJkeEHM,4715520,4721840,what the net's future is and the 29th  there is the start of nba free agency  so the 30th it's right before the start
KNl9UJkeEHM,4721840,4728560,of the nba free agency period so it  would allow the nets if they lose kyrie  to maybe build that roster around katie
KNl9UJkeEHM,4728560,4733679,if he wants to stay i'm not sure what to  think of this i don't know if it's a  leverage play by ked to put pressure on
KNl9UJkeEHM,4733679,4740000,the nets organization to bring back  kyrie and he's making his message be  known now that if they don't retain
KNl9UJkeEHM,4740000,4746960,kyrie irving and he bolts elsewhere via  trader free agency then he's gonna be  unhappy and that puts pressure on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,4746960,4753760,nets to bring him back  kyrie how about you just come back for  one year sign a one-year deal try to see
KNl9UJkeEHM,4753760,4760239,what happens with brooklyn play  alongside kevin durant you have joe  harris coming back off the injury as  well as ben simmons a couple of really
KNl9UJkeEHM,4760239,4766480,good players who drafted last year and  deyron sharp as well as cam thomas you  have seth curry that's a roster that i
KNl9UJkeEHM,4766480,4771520,think could win a lot of games 50 plus  in the regular season  yeah i mean i'm with you it'll be very
KNl9UJkeEHM,4771520,4776560,interesting to see and i think that is a  lost thing about the nets is they didn't  have joe harris this year so they really
KNl9UJkeEHM,4776560,4783760,needed uh his uh his three-point  shooting will katie and kyrie return to  the nets why for yes and for no
KNl9UJkeEHM,4783760,4790239,uh this is uh  the question we're asking right now  alexis says no jordan says yes brian
KNl9UJkeEHM,4790239,4795920,says no  uh let's see morrow says no we got holy  ghost saying yes
KNl9UJkeEHM,4795920,4803600,um morrow says no alexander says yes don  says no  uh let's see rogue says yes joseph says
KNl9UJkeEHM,4803600,4809840,yes  um chicago bulls in the chat uh i think  the bulls love to get uh kd i'll tell
KNl9UJkeEHM,4809840,4817040,you that right now why for yes inferno  will they return like the video let's  get to 2 000 likes we're just over 300
KNl9UJkeEHM,4817040,4822239,away uh shots for 2k you in oh yeah  let's do it all right we'll take a shot
KNl9UJkeEHM,4822239,4827520,for 2 000 likes and then we'll get that  roulette wheel spin going too we still  owe you guys one of those
KNl9UJkeEHM,4827520,4833679,uh as well so like the video if you guys  are excited so it turns out i'm sorry
KNl9UJkeEHM,4833679,4838719,this is producer sam by the way uh that  super chat 200 250 filipino
KNl9UJkeEHM,4838719,4844960,whatever currency it is it's actually  only five bucks unfortunately  it's yellow though i know i i don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,4844960,4850560,don't blame youtube i don't know  it seems suspicious  all right unless the conversion rates
KNl9UJkeEHM,4850560,4856080,changed okay all right seems suspicious  like the video we're 200 likes away from
KNl9UJkeEHM,4856080,4862560,2000  and uh once we get there chase and i  will take a shot so hit that thumbs up
KNl9UJkeEHM,4862560,4868320,icon  a lot of kaisoto fans do you think it's  possible to get the 310 000 subs before
KNl9UJkeEHM,4868320,4873520,the draft  what are we at about 800 away  i think it's possible i think it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,4873520,4879198,possible we'll make another push yeah we  still on sub only or we turn that off
KNl9UJkeEHM,4879280,4884320,we'll see we'll make a push all right  let's talk about the magic chase because  they're on the clock first here in about
KNl9UJkeEHM,4884320,4889920,37 minutes uh all the buzz is around  jabari smith out of auburn
KNl9UJkeEHM,4889920,4896080,um is that the right pick in your eyes  yeah for the magic i think jabari smith  is the smartest player i'd think about
KNl9UJkeEHM,4896080,4901600,paulo bencaro but how does he fit on the  floor with wendell carter if he's in  your future plans jabari smith is the
KNl9UJkeEHM,4901600,4907520,wing that the magic really need a guy  who shot more than 40 percent from three  last year bruce pearl on with colin
KNl9UJkeEHM,4907520,4913520,cowherd yesterday said he's like kevin  durant now he doesn't have the handle of  kevin durant he doesn't have the  all-around game of kevin durant but
KNl9UJkeEHM,4913520,4920239,jabari smith has  high upside as a defender and as a shot  maker he can get a shot off from
KNl9UJkeEHM,4920239,4925280,anywhere going up against anybody  because of the pogo sticks for legs and
KNl9UJkeEHM,4925280,4930960,the bounce that he has but also the  length now he does have that high  release point at six nine six ten like
KNl9UJkeEHM,4930960,4937520,kevin durant that's why i'm bringing him  in also people have raved about his  competitiveness his drive his
KNl9UJkeEHM,4937520,4943280,willingness to take on competition i  love  all of that in terms of a makeup for a
KNl9UJkeEHM,4943280,4948400,guy who could go number one because i  know he's gonna put the necessary work  in to work on his flaws and right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,4948400,4954480,the big flaw for him it's his handle  other than that i love his all-around  game yeah and the expectation is that he
KNl9UJkeEHM,4954480,4961920,will go number one he actually said  earlier today that chris haynes in an  interview that he'd be surprised if he  didn't go number one so

KNl9UJkeEHM,5254000,5259840,uh until the draft is here you know  what's funny chase  there's not a lot of buzz right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,5259840,5266159,there's not a lot there's no wode bombs  coming in no  shams is quiet so we're kind of just
KNl9UJkeEHM,5266159,5272880,hanging out uh here's the draft order uh  magic thunder rockets kings we'll kind  of just rotate through these as we talk
KNl9UJkeEHM,5272880,5279679,some of the story lines  leading up to the draft  it's been widely thought for i'd say
KNl9UJkeEHM,5279679,5286239,about a week comfortably chase jabari  would go one chat home grin two and  paulo ben caro three
KNl9UJkeEHM,5286239,5292320,what's your gut feeling what happens at  four with sacramento do they keep that  pick and make a selection do they trade
KNl9UJkeEHM,5292320,5298239,the pick we're kind of coming down to  the wire here we're going to find out in  the next price hour or so by the time
KNl9UJkeEHM,5298239,5305280,they get on the clock  do the smart thing and just draft jay  nivea i think he's one of the more pro  ready prospects in this draft when i
KNl9UJkeEHM,5305280,5311199,watch him i'm like man this guy plays  and carries himself has the confidence  and swagger of a john moran and
KNl9UJkeEHM,5311199,5317760,athletically that's really what you look  for in a lot of these prospects does the  athleticism translate and then what else
KNl9UJkeEHM,5317760,5324320,does that respective player have now of  course athleticism isn't everything but  with jay knivey he has the athleticism
KNl9UJkeEHM,5324320,5330000,he has a three-point shot he can get to  the rim i'd like to see him improve his  decision-making because sometimes he
KNl9UJkeEHM,5330000,5335360,does make some dumbfounding decisions  but he's never scared  in the big moment and i love that about
KNl9UJkeEHM,5335360,5341199,him i'm going jay nivey at number four  and if you say well that clashes with  daveon mitchell and
KNl9UJkeEHM,5341199,5347920,you know darren fox i'm figuring all the  rest out later now if keegan murray is  there and jane ivey's off the board
KNl9UJkeEHM,5347920,5354159,maybe you make a switch there but in  that instance you probably have your  pick at chet holmgren or maybe paulo ben
KNl9UJkeEHM,5354159,5359920,carroll so i'd stay there i'd make the  pic continue to build this young nucleus  and try to build within the giraffe with
KNl9UJkeEHM,5359920,5365920,some homegrown talent the fact that they  traded away the only player in the last  two decades who actually wanted to play
KNl9UJkeEHM,5365920,5371440,in sacramento and tyreese halliburton  who by the way is an excellent player  that's a joke yeah they got a that
KNl9UJkeEHM,5371440,5376560,organization  needs rebranding for damanta sabonis  come on now hopefully mike brown gives
KNl9UJkeEHM,5376560,5382480,him some credibility he's had mixed  results as a head coach but uh you know  steve kerr has spoken highly of him so
KNl9UJkeEHM,5382480,5387920,we'll see if that helps uh as uh we move  forward here we have some super chats to
KNl9UJkeEHM,5387920,5393679,catch up on uh as we just cycle through  the first round draft order a lot of  these trade picks have been traded
KNl9UJkeEHM,5393679,5399600,multiple times by the way  because that's how things go all right  chase uh teams or some guys want to know
KNl9UJkeEHM,5399600,5405760,uh what they we think about their teams  talk clippers we mentioned kyrie earlier  you know we could
KNl9UJkeEHM,5405760,5411199,briefly hit that what are some other  things there's been some uh chatter nick  batum opted out it sounds like there's
KNl9UJkeEHM,5411199,5416320,mutual interest in bringing him back  i think he's been a really good role  player for that team that's a that's an
KNl9UJkeEHM,5416320,5421840,area you could see this team going yeah  but tomb fits perfectly for what the  clippers want to do have a big who can
KNl9UJkeEHM,5421840,5427679,mix it up down low just a bit but also  you give that finesse big guy who can  knock down some threes and last year he
KNl9UJkeEHM,5427679,5433040,was right around 40 he's a really  skilled offensive player he opted out  that was kind of expected he can opt in
KNl9UJkeEHM,5433040,5438400,for more money or test the market to see  which title teams want to pay him  because i do think that he's an
KNl9UJkeEHM,5438400,5443440,important championship piece he's from  france he's played in a bunch of big  olympic games he's been in the nba for a
KNl9UJkeEHM,5443440,5448800,really long time has great experience  honestly i don't think the clippers need  to do that much you know what you need
KNl9UJkeEHM,5448800,5454080,to do get kawhi back healthy get paul  george back 100 off that shoulder injury
KNl9UJkeEHM,5454080,5461520,he was pretty good in the nba bubble  before he got hit with coven  i like terrence mann i also
KNl9UJkeEHM,5461520,5468159,like luke canard as a shooter although  detroit overpaid for him way too much  and reggie jackson is a guy who can put
KNl9UJkeEHM,5468159,5473520,the ball on the floor and break down  some defenses in a different way than  paul george and kawhi from the wings
KNl9UJkeEHM,5473520,5479679,marcus morris key role player look two  years ago if kawhi doesn't tear his acl  they might be in the nba finals yeah i
KNl9UJkeEHM,5479679,5486159,mean that's just the reality they lost  to phoenix in six in the western  conference finals jk memes uh pinker
KNl9UJkeEHM,5486159,5491440,goes first to the rockets via trade oh  so you think houston trades up i don't  think they need to yeah i don't think
KNl9UJkeEHM,5491440,5499679,they need to either i think they might  get ben carrot number three yeah i i  think you're you can hang out at three  if you're houston uh joey olstad uh he
KNl9UJkeEHM,5499679,5505520,wants us to talk about the kings here  chase so uh that's kind of the that a  lot of people feel like this is where
KNl9UJkeEHM,5505520,5512159,the draft starts chase that fourth pick  with sacramento you know we both believe  drafting ivy is the smart move but we
KNl9UJkeEHM,5512159,5518159,know the knicks have been a team that  have been interested in moving up  obviously you've got dear and fox i
KNl9UJkeEHM,5518159,5523840,would commit to him long term especially  after trading halliburton why would you  trade fox 2. i don't think that makes
KNl9UJkeEHM,5523840,5531360,any sense they drafted davey on mitchell  last year um there's some talent here i  like sabonis as a big who they went out
KNl9UJkeEHM,5531360,5536800,and got i do wonder if trading rashaan  holmes could be in the cards because  you're kind of running into the
KNl9UJkeEHM,5536800,5543440,sabonis-miles turner thing does it make  sense to have sabonis and rashawn holmes  i think moving homes could make sense so
KNl9UJkeEHM,5543440,5548719,those are a couple of things they could  do yeah holmes is like the robert  williams type of player that boston has
KNl9UJkeEHM,5548719,5554560,and boston proved that that player can  be extremely valuable yeah so if you  play him at the five spot i think you
KNl9UJkeEHM,5554560,5560080,can get away with that you have demonthe  sabonis at the four what does that leave  open if you go and fox and davey on
KNl9UJkeEHM,5560080,5566400,mitchell off those two guard spots  by the way finished the regular season  really well alongside d aaron fox but
KNl9UJkeEHM,5566400,5572080,one of those guys like davion could come  in off the bench what does that lead to  you need a wing benedict matherin could
KNl9UJkeEHM,5572080,5579120,be the guy jane ivy could be that guy as  well now he's not necessarily a wing  he's a guard but the kings can do a
KNl9UJkeEHM,5579120,5584639,couple of things here do they want to go  big keegan murray who reminds me of a  little bit more of an athletic al
KNl9UJkeEHM,5584639,5590960,horford and is just an overall winning  player that could be in play as well  although i expect it and want it and
KNl9UJkeEHM,5590960,5598080,think it should be jay nivey uh  that black dude  just reading your name nice talk about
KNl9UJkeEHM,5598080,5604480,my wizards hey man listen johnny davis  maybe we were talking about this in the  office earlier well that can be the
KNl9UJkeEHM,5604480,5609679,draft angle  what if  kyrie gets out
KNl9UJkeEHM,5609679,5616719,and kevin durant's like you know what  i want to salvage my legacy a little bit  i'm going home to washington wow beale
KNl9UJkeEHM,5616719,5621760,play with bro durant and porzingis if  porzingis is your third guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,5621760,5627600,you feel a lot better i've never really  thought about that that's pretty  fascinating you know i don't know man it
KNl9UJkeEHM,5627600,5634320,would be interesting now maybe you'd  have to move porzingis make that happen  but obviously you would do that i mean  that's not even a question i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,5634320,5641199,durant and beale is honestly a better  combo than durant and kyrie yeah i think  yeah no i think you're right i think you
KNl9UJkeEHM,5641199,5646800,win an nba title nowadays at the wing  position now you look at the golden  state warriors that's the exception but
KNl9UJkeEHM,5646800,5653440,the construction of that roster top to  bottom they still have always  still have great thompson uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,5653440,5659040,wiggins this year  draymond is kind of a wing you need a  good win yeah yeah so you know you look
KNl9UJkeEHM,5659040,5664239,at a team like the sixers you have that  tobias harris but outside of that you  don't really have that you know you
KNl9UJkeEHM,5664239,5672480,don't have that depth yeah  a game of 21. five bucks appreciate that  nice i'll play 21. arvin kenneth milari

KNl9UJkeEHM,5705760,5712080,single minute of value in the postseason  it's a good trade for dallas yeah and  maybe the rockets cut bob on he doesn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,5712080,5718320,fit their timeline yeah you maybe traded  away a late round you know or late 26  for christian woods a guy who could
KNl9UJkeEHM,5718320,5726560,score 18 to 20 points and grab 10  rebounds so uh that was an absolute win  for dallas all right uh chase senior got

KNl9UJkeEHM,5991199,5997280,consideration  at number one overall so chase here's  what i'm gonna do
KNl9UJkeEHM,5997280,6002480,i'm gonna let you talk about this report  and kind of talk about the number one  overall pick i'm gonna hop off for a
KNl9UJkeEHM,6002480,6009280,couple minutes uh uh quick bathroom run  before the draft gets going in less than  20 minutes so talk to people through
KNl9UJkeEHM,6009280,6015520,this number one pick dilemma for uh  orlando and i'll be back in a few  minutes yeah so adrian wojnarowski on
KNl9UJkeEHM,6015520,6021280,espn right now as i just reported on our  nba draft show on espn duke's paulo
KNl9UJkeEHM,6021280,6027440,bencaro has joined auburn's jabari smith  under serious consideration to be the  franchise number one overall pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,6027440,6032480,there's a real chance that draft boards  could get blown up at the top of the  lottery and
KNl9UJkeEHM,6032480,6039679,those are facts if  paulo bencaro ends up going number one  jabari smith falls to number two
KNl9UJkeEHM,6039679,6045360,what does okc do at that point they  could really use a good scoring wing and  that's exactly what smith is and then
KNl9UJkeEHM,6045360,6051520,what happens to chet holmgren does he go  number three to the houston rockets does  he slide to the sacramento kings at
KNl9UJkeEHM,6051520,6057679,number four  if paulo goes number one it changes  draft boards dramatically that is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,6057679,6063840,fascinating nugget from adrian  wojnarowski now he had reported earlier  this morning that he was hearing the top
KNl9UJkeEHM,6063840,6070800,three consensus-wise was going to be  smith one bancaro ii or homegrown two
KNl9UJkeEHM,6070800,6077040,and chet holmgren number three but the  orlando magic are in a situation where  they have a good team i think they
KNl9UJkeEHM,6077040,6083600,should go jabari smith they need a  scoring wing he can be that guy with  cole anthony markell fultz jalen suggs
KNl9UJkeEHM,6083600,6090080,franz wagner wendell carter you put  jabari smith into the mix i think the  magic become one of the more intriguing
KNl9UJkeEHM,6090080,6097280,young teams in the nba you go with paulo  bencaro he might be one of the more sure  thing prospects in this draft class but
KNl9UJkeEHM,6097280,6103119,it does throw a wrench into the plans  for other teams after the orlando magic  so with that we want to get the comments
KNl9UJkeEHM,6103119,6109280,section going once again with this new  report from loge  who do you think goes number one are you
KNl9UJkeEHM,6109280,6114320,sticking by your guns and you're saying  jabari smith type js ch for chet
KNl9UJkeEHM,6114320,6120080,holmgren pb for palo bencaro let me know  in the comment section you do that with

KNl9UJkeEHM,6131040,6137360,super chat sticker five dollar super  chat coming in from michael hate where  do you think david roddy will be drafted
KNl9UJkeEHM,6137360,6143360,i think at the top of the second round  in the 30 to 40 range if he goes to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,6143360,6150800,mid 40s i'll be really surprised there  cheers to you i'll certainly drink to  that and nazoo with this super chat five
KNl9UJkeEHM,6150800,6157600,bones as well lakers can you talk about  who the lakers could get at the 35th  pick they just acquired you guys are
KNl9UJkeEHM,6157600,6163040,awesome greatly appreciate all of you  for making our nba draft coverage a part  of your day
KNl9UJkeEHM,6163040,6170159,i'm gonna pull up kind of my draft board  right now with some of the players that  could fall to the lakers at 35. kennedy
KNl9UJkeEHM,6170159,6176000,chandler if he drops as a tyrese maxie  type of guard he would be awesome for  the lakers because they need a playmaker
KNl9UJkeEHM,6176000,6183119,at the guard spot who they can develop  over time and i think the kennedy  chandler has scoring ability right away  patrick baldwin former high-end high
KNl9UJkeEHM,6183119,6188880,school recruit didn't go to a big school  went to milwaukee to play for his dad  really struggled there coveted some
KNl9UJkeEHM,6188880,6195760,injuries and then you also look at some  other players andrew nemhart five-year  college player from gonzaga jake laravia
KNl9UJkeEHM,6195760,6202159,might sneak into the first if he's not  he could be a kyle anderson type for la  kendall brown is a forward who has
KNl9UJkeEHM,6202159,6208480,shades of kenrich williams and grant  williams caleb houston out of michigan  some players in that range who could be
KNl9UJkeEHM,6208480,6214719,interesting we go to this super chat  from cash man is check gonna be the next  durant in your opinion no he doesn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,6214719,6220000,have even the size that kevin durant had  coming out of texas and for durant his
KNl9UJkeEHM,6220000,6226719,size or lack thereof was certainly a big  concern but he was a better scorer than  chet holmgren a better ball handler than
KNl9UJkeEHM,6226719,6232320,chet and overall more skilled now is  chet extremely gifted for seven feet yes
KNl9UJkeEHM,6232320,6238560,is he a good rim protector with nearly  four blocks last year no question about  it he weighs as much as me and he's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,6238560,6243920,foot taller than me those are the  concerns that i have his legs are rail  thin and throughout the course of an 82
KNl9UJkeEHM,6243920,6250480,game regular season schedule how does he  fare if he takes a knee to the thigh or  if he takes a knee to knee and how does
KNl9UJkeEHM,6250480,6256400,he fare against some other big beefier  big men across the nba i have concerns  there can he stretch the floor knock
KNl9UJkeEHM,6256400,6262960,down threes does he have the dribble  pull-up game for sure what he lacks in  strength which he gives up defensively
KNl9UJkeEHM,6262960,6269840,does he make up for it by blocking some  shots with that aforementioned length  yes but  while he's an elite shot blocker with
KNl9UJkeEHM,6269840,6275600,good touch around the rim and from  distance my goodness the size really  does concern me another five dollar
KNl9UJkeEHM,6275600,6281840,super chat coming in from scoob i'll  talk about the blazer should the blazers  pursue og and obi maybe they can trade
KNl9UJkeEHM,6281840,6287679,this year's pick also  who won the pistons or blazers trade for  grant i think we stole them scoob i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,6287679,6293920,answer that but with all those five  dollar super chats gonna do a quick beer  cheers here
KNl9UJkeEHM,6295760,6302320,so for the blazers  i think you go after ogn and obi with  damien lullard he's now in his early 30s
KNl9UJkeEHM,6302320,6308400,his usage rate has been extremely high a  lot of tread on the tires how many prime  years does he have left because some of
KNl9UJkeEHM,6308400,6313760,these smaller guards don't age all that  well damian lillard could be one of them  although i think he has a couple of
KNl9UJkeEHM,6313760,6320560,prime years left point here being you  take a guy at number seven  maybe he doesn't impact you right away a
KNl9UJkeEHM,6320560,6325679,guy like ogn and obi gives you a high  level two-way wing who's really grown as
KNl9UJkeEHM,6325679,6332639,an offensive player this past year 17 18  points per game and defensively he is  fantastic with that length so i'd say go
KNl9UJkeEHM,6332639,6338639,after him and according to chris haynes  the blazers are in pursuit of trading  for him jaquavious dorsey with the five
KNl9UJkeEHM,6338639,6345679,dollar super chat just showing love my  god greatly appreciate you for tuning in  and everybody else who is watching our

KNl9UJkeEHM,6417600,6424000,keegan murray aj griffin and benedict  matheran that's the top eight right  there as for nine through 12 johnny
KNl9UJkeEHM,6424000,6431040,davis dyson daniels out of the g league  ignite jeremy sohan one of my favorite  players in this class at number 11. he
KNl9UJkeEHM,6431040,6437920,could sneak into the top 10 potentially  jalen durham a lot of buzz behind him  going to the san antonio spurs at number
KNl9UJkeEHM,6437920,6443040,nine  uber athletic hyper athletic big who can  certainly block shots can't really do
KNl9UJkeEHM,6443040,6448960,much else other than that but we saw the  impact that robert williams had  defensively and offensively at times for
KNl9UJkeEHM,6448960,6456320,the boston celtics jalen duren is that  type of player so those are some of the  best available guys in the top 12 and
KNl9UJkeEHM,6456320,6463440,obviously 58 picks tonight because of  the bulls and heat getting hit with some  of those tampering charges so two less

KNl9UJkeEHM,6608639,6615679,benedict matheran is a player i like a  lot  i think those are a few guys that could  make some sense

KNl9UJkeEHM,6751440,6758400,the first round of this draft uh we will  see what they target could use another  three and d type of player center is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,6758400,6765840,big question mark von looney's a free  agent uh james wiseman did not play at  all last season so will he be a guy that
KNl9UJkeEHM,6765840,6771760,they can rely on moving forward if the  answer is no could a guy like walker  kessler be the answer there could a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,6771760,6777679,like christian koloko be a potential  target for golden state could they trade  the pick there's been a lot of buzz that
KNl9UJkeEHM,6777679,6784000,they could trade that selection  obviously they could use more depth but  the core is in place uh they're in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,6784000,6790239,luxury tax uh by choice because they're  chasing nba championships those are a  couple of different spots
KNl9UJkeEHM,6790239,6795760,that they could target to help improve  that roster so it looks like we got

KNl9UJkeEHM,7171280,7177760,now i woke up this morning i took a look  at the vegas odds they had paulo bencaro  going number one but adrian mojnarowski
KNl9UJkeEHM,7177760,7183440,originally had tweeted and reported that  it was going to be jabari smith chet  holmgren paolo bankera but just moments

KNl9UJkeEHM,7201440,7207920,draft we're going to continue to react  to this orlando magic about to be on the  clock but a big shocker and big late
KNl9UJkeEHM,7207920,7213360,development which now sets up the draft  board in a fascinating fashion because
KNl9UJkeEHM,7213360,7218400,it's jabari smith gonna go number two  okc  they're huge fans of chet holmgren and
KNl9UJkeEHM,7218400,7224880,chet and his agent want to go to the  thunder but can you pass up on jabari  smith and if they don't jabari smith to

KNl9UJkeEHM,7272400,7278239,place the best available best based on i  should say the overall draft composite
KNl9UJkeEHM,7278239,7284400,chase this isn't your personal list it's  kind of taken a list from a few  different outlets here chet's kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,7284400,7289920,been the number one prospect but it  sounds like it's ban carro or jabari  smith going one here magic not
KNl9UJkeEHM,7289920,7296800,officially on the clock but they're  about to be yeah and ben carro might be  the most pro ready prospect in this  class outside of jaden ivy the orlando
KNl9UJkeEHM,7296800,7303199,magic draft him and i think that he is a  plug and play impact player from day one  i kind of compare him to chris webber
KNl9UJkeEHM,7303199,7308239,great feel for the game basketball  smarts can really score well for a big
KNl9UJkeEHM,7308239,7314560,man has awesome footwork has this  mid-range game that i really like and in  the ncaa tournament shot about 50 from
KNl9UJkeEHM,7314560,7320480,beyond the arc so as a big guy to be  able to do that in today's nba where  some of these hybrid bigs work out
KNl9UJkeEHM,7320480,7326000,really well ben carroll can be a very  good player for a long time and it  wasn't close between having jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,7326000,7331440,number one on my big board and ben  carroll number two it was jabari with a  slight edge well we'll see who goes
KNl9UJkeEHM,7331440,7337040,number one but help us be number one on  youtube most biggest audience like the

KNl9UJkeEHM,7368000,7373920,for the orlando magic to be on the clock  looks like adam silver is introducing  the draft here chase so the magic will
KNl9UJkeEHM,7373920,7380480,be on the clock shortly so let's go back  to this question who's going number one  it's really jabari smith or paolo
KNl9UJkeEHM,7380480,7386000,bencaro it doesn't sound like chet  holmgren's in the mix this is also the  live poll question the audience still
KNl9UJkeEHM,7386000,7392159,thinks it's jabari sounds like there's  been a late shift though yeah a monster  late shift because nobody woke up this
KNl9UJkeEHM,7392159,7398239,morning and i don't think expected paulo  ben carroll to go number one especially  when woda tw wojt tweeted that jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,7398239,7405280,smith was going to go atop this draft  but look the gap between smith and ben  carro is very very minimal these are two
KNl9UJkeEHM,7405280,7410719,really good players in fact the only  wild card on your screen right now in my  opinion is chet holmgren i wouldn't have
KNl9UJkeEHM,7410719,7415840,drafted him in my top five i think there  are other players that are better  including benedict mather and jay nivea
KNl9UJkeEHM,7415840,7421599,and shane sharp it's been a two horse  race all along in my opinion for the  number one overall pick between smith
KNl9UJkeEHM,7421599,7427280,and ben carroll at least in my eyes and  it could be ban cara pulling off the  late upset just like a late kentucky
KNl9UJkeEHM,7427280,7433040,derby splurge well adam silver continues  to talk at the podium the magic not  technically on the clock yet they will

KNl9UJkeEHM,7532880,7535040,how
KNl9UJkeEHM,7538800,7543920,i just i don't know yeah so i was  looking at this tweet from jake fisher  he said the sense among ben carro's camp
KNl9UJkeEHM,7543920,7549360,after calls with orlando on wednesday  magic officially on the clock by the way  it was split so they're not sure if the
KNl9UJkeEHM,7549360,7555840,magic were serious or not about taking  him number one is this a leak you can  never rule out leaks in the nba off
KNl9UJkeEHM,7555840,7561520,season because stuff gets crazy on your  screen right now we're filtering through  the first couple of picks and first
KNl9UJkeEHM,7561520,7567199,several picks in the nba draft the  orlando magic officially on the clock  they have five minutes to make their
KNl9UJkeEHM,7567199,7573599,selection and they've had a couple of  high-end draft picks over time penny  hardaway shaquille o'neal last year
KNl9UJkeEHM,7573599,7580239,jalen suggs franz wagner next up it's a  number one pick dwight howard has to be  in that mix as well who is it going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,7580239,7585920,be to be the next lineage as part of  that is it going to be palo is it going  to be jabari smith what the hell happens
KNl9UJkeEHM,7585920,7592000,if it's chet holmgren that would really  be crazy which do you actually think is  the better fit for elaine i think it's  shabari smith they need a wing on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,7592000,7597040,team they have guards they have a big in  wendell carter you drop paulo can he
KNl9UJkeEHM,7597040,7602880,play alongside wendell carter jr for  sure i just think they need a wing and i  think you win with wings and that is
KNl9UJkeEHM,7602880,7609280,clearly the need on that roster maybe  they go small they let mo bamba go and  wendell carter plays the fox could do
KNl9UJkeEHM,7609280,7614800,that he's 16. yeah you can do that  nowadays nba for sure caro can play  stretch four i think he could play some
KNl9UJkeEHM,7614800,7621280,three i don't think full time but uh let  us know who's going number one magic are  on the clock every team has five or so
KNl9UJkeEHM,7621280,7627040,minutes per pick uh throughout the first  round of the draft uh so uh we will uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,7627040,7633360,get that to you as soon as the pick is  made by the way five minutes between  picks huge win as compared to 10 minutes
KNl9UJkeEHM,7633360,7639360,yes good pace good pace what's that  sorry  we'll get some shout outs uh we have
KNl9UJkeEHM,7639360,7646079,some super chats i'm not sure if i  actually have those on my screen i don't  have them either yeah i had to refresh
KNl9UJkeEHM,7646079,7651920,here shout outs right now i see them on  the screen unfortunately there's just a  lot going on so may not be able to pull  them up right now but we'll try and pull
KNl9UJkeEHM,7651920,7658560,them up throughout the night for you  guys uh nakeem zakir  299 thank you for that timothy peterson
KNl9UJkeEHM,7658560,7665199,sent in two dollars nakeem actually sent  in a second super chat every day jam two  dollars and our dub zzz two dollars
KNl9UJkeEHM,7665199,7671040,appreciate you guys sending supers keep  them coming the pick is in according to  multiple reports chase and we'll go
KNl9UJkeEHM,7671040,7676880,ahead and reveal that here it's palo  palomancaro so  not sure exactly we'll see if more
KNl9UJkeEHM,7676880,7683119,reports come out when this late shift  happened like you said jake fisher  reported that on wednesday vancaro's
KNl9UJkeEHM,7683119,7690159,camp felt pretty good about this but  throughout it sounded like it was jabari  smith but some late momentum like you
KNl9UJkeEHM,7690159,7697040,said vegas knows paulo bencaro the  forward out of duke can play some three  can play some four he's gonna land with
KNl9UJkeEHM,7697040,7702880,orlando at number one overall i really  like ben carroll as a player i had a  number two on my best available right
KNl9UJkeEHM,7702880,7709599,behind jabari smith but that's not a  slight against ben carro the gap between  those players was so minimal season
KNl9UJkeEHM,7709599,7716400,prospect really has the upside to  blossom into a star i love his interior  scoring ability in the ncaa tournament
KNl9UJkeEHM,7716400,7722880,he showed off his three-point shot for a  big has really good ball handling skills  love his play making as a passer out of
KNl9UJkeEHM,7722880,7729360,the low and high post great feel for the  game and because of all that my pro comp  for him was chris webber and chris weber
KNl9UJkeEHM,7729360,7734560,for a long time with the sacramento  kings was one of the best power forwards  and one of the most gifted power
KNl9UJkeEHM,7734560,7741520,forwards that we'd ever seen and last  year with duke 17 points per game nearly  eight rebounds three plus dimes and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,7741520,7746560,steal per night you look at that steel  number and it looks pretty solid the big
KNl9UJkeEHM,7746560,7753520,area where bankero needs to get better  is on the defensive side of the floor  sometimes he can get put in a turnstile
KNl9UJkeEHM,7753520,7758560,and he's athletic enough to be a good  defensive player i think it comes down  to effort but that's what ben carroll
KNl9UJkeEHM,7758560,7765119,has to work on and for the magic couple  of really good young pieces here now  cole anthony markell fultz jalen suggs
KNl9UJkeEHM,7765119,7770880,franz wagner wendell carter jr paulo  bencaro to the mix magic arrow pointing
KNl9UJkeEHM,7770880,7778159,up as well as that trajectory grade the  pick because a lot of grades are already  coming in f foot says c uh dolly says c
KNl9UJkeEHM,7778159,7784159,b minus from marco who even cares says a  c from f foot uh sorry to the kai soto
KNl9UJkeEHM,7784159,7789679,folks thinking he was going number one  did not happen mike dibble says b
KNl9UJkeEHM,7789679,7797040,we got uh meena k saying b as well  macmac says a we got mr a saying beef
KNl9UJkeEHM,7797040,7802560,looks like by the way it's not official  a lot of buzz that jabari smith is now
KNl9UJkeEHM,7802560,7808159,going to be the pick to the thunder  how far will chet holmgren fall woj just
KNl9UJkeEHM,7808159,7815639,said chet holmgren remains the front  runner  reports conflicting reports
KNl9UJkeEHM,7816159,7822480,jerry says b  brum says b  he says the front runner no pick has
KNl9UJkeEHM,7822480,7828159,been made let's make that clear that  pick is not in uh sammy boy the pick is
KNl9UJkeEHM,7828159,7835520,not in uh for oklahoma city uh as uh we  await here uh sports guru says a
KNl9UJkeEHM,7835520,7843280,word says that uh he's the front runner  chet holmgren but there's also reports  that it could be jabari smith what's uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,7843280,7848320,what's he gonna do uh so chris  jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,7848320,7853679,and then woad said chet holmgren remains  the front runner conflicting reports big
KNl9UJkeEHM,7853679,7858800,j uh  battle on the nba draft hey drama early
KNl9UJkeEHM,7858800,7866239,we can't ask for any more yeah like the  video if you're having a blast hit that  thumbs up icon and uh we will see what
KNl9UJkeEHM,7866239,7872159,the oklahoma city thunder do in this pic  who should the thunder draft let us know
KNl9UJkeEHM,7872159,7877520,in the comments  i'd go jabari man i'd go jabba he's a  hooper yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,7877520,7884880,look him next to shake hill just  alexander  josh giddy with his passing ability to  find a 40-plus percent three-point
KNl9UJkeEHM,7884880,7891280,shooter around the arc jabari smith is  also a really good defensive player you  have lou dort some questions in that
KNl9UJkeEHM,7891280,7899199,front court no question about it but i'm  going wing over big seven days a week  nowadays deleted his tweet about jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,7899199,7906239,smith really so that would lead one to  believe that chet holmgren is the  front-runner here but nothing official
KNl9UJkeEHM,7906239,7911360,yet we're still waiting for the pick to  come in  wow drama early you gotta love it you
KNl9UJkeEHM,7911360,7917199,gotta love it yeah so now you take a  look at the best players available this  is the composite all the best big boards
KNl9UJkeEHM,7917199,7922239,out there i had chet holmgren number  seven on my top ten prospects but he
KNl9UJkeEHM,7922239,7929199,volts up to number one i'd go jabari  smith personally jay nivey becomes  really interesting at number three or
KNl9UJkeEHM,7929199,7935360,number four so too does shaden sharp so  those are the four best available right  now you have to throw keegan murray into
KNl9UJkeEHM,7935360,7941199,the mix the best most polished big slash  forward in this draft as well so who do
KNl9UJkeEHM,7941199,7948239,you think the thunder should draft is it  chet holmgren is it jabari smith let us  know in the comment section right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,7948239,7954800,sounds like it's going to be chet chase  that is where the momentum is going here  let us know who you guys think they
KNl9UJkeEHM,7954800,7961599,should go ahead and select  i think it's gonna be chat  yeah sham sharanya reporting that it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,7961599,7967040,gonna be chet holmgren so chet holmgren  gonna go to the thunder here at number
KNl9UJkeEHM,7967040,7972719,two after some brief drama thinking they  might take jabari smith but chet
KNl9UJkeEHM,7972719,7979840,holmgren the selection here  listen i know you're not as high on him  but he can block shots he's really
KNl9UJkeEHM,7979840,7986320,skilled the problem is is he just gonna  get beat up in this league i mean he's  so thin
KNl9UJkeEHM,7986320,7993199,it's unclear among some nba teams how  much he actually weighs that's a bit of  a minor red flag i would say as well for
KNl9UJkeEHM,7993199,7999280,sure and he's listed at 195 pounds  there's no way that that channel is 195  pounds i thought it was a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,7999280,8005280,concerning that he didn't turn in his  medicals to the orlando magic or the  oklahoma city thunder but chet going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,8005280,8012400,okc according to many reports out there  and some buzz that we were hearing he  wanted to go to okc because of the other
KNl9UJkeEHM,8012400,8019280,pieces on that roster and his agent  wanted him to go to okc and if you're  the houston rockets in my opinion at
KNl9UJkeEHM,8019280,8024400,number three  they kind of got shafted in the nba  draft lottery and now
KNl9UJkeEHM,8024400,8030560,they in my opinion get the best player  in this draft at number three and jabari  smith because of holmgren going to to
KNl9UJkeEHM,8030560,8036159,okc look at the numbers here for chet 14  points per game 10 rebounds
KNl9UJkeEHM,8036159,8041520,and nearly four blocks per game this guy  is a special rim protector and has
KNl9UJkeEHM,8041520,8047440,awesome instincts around the rim that  was at the college level though that was  in a weak college basketball conference
KNl9UJkeEHM,8047440,8052639,how does he fare going up against an  embiid going up against a go bear or a
KNl9UJkeEHM,8052639,8058560,jokic or even an anthony davis if lebron  james or luke doncic take him down to  the low block
KNl9UJkeEHM,8058560,8064800,is he gonna be able to hold his own now  what he lacks in size in terms of  players backing him down he can make up
KNl9UJkeEHM,8064800,8070320,for it with just the length and he's so  smart on that end i just worry about the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8070320,8075920,long term sustainability of that body  the rigors of an 82 game regular season
KNl9UJkeEHM,8075920,8082320,schedule as well as him playing in the  playoffs if he takes a knee to the thigh  or to the knee we know that's really
KNl9UJkeEHM,8082320,8088320,painful how does he sustain the contact  on the low block now he can live around  the perimeter for sure but if you're
KNl9UJkeEHM,8088320,8093360,playing him at forward or center he  needs to give you some tick on the low  block how do you feel about this pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,8093360,8099520,love it or hate it anthony says love it  jose loves it vivian hates it uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,8099520,8106639,david hates it we got s2 loving it uh  jomanth  loves it as well aj hates it mj hates it
KNl9UJkeEHM,8106639,8114800,sleeks loves it jt loves it sleeks loves  it  lynx hates it as well 23 000 and change

KNl9UJkeEHM,8145679,8152639,paulo ben carroll goes one chat  homegrown goes two houston rockets on  the clock chase they might just get
KNl9UJkeEHM,8152639,8159760,jabari smith now and if that's the case  they get in my opinion the number one  player in this draft class and as i said
KNl9UJkeEHM,8159760,8166400,slight margin jabari smith over paolo  ben carro but if you're houston you're  sitting pretty here you already have
KNl9UJkeEHM,8166400,8173520,some young assets on that team i love  what they did in the giraffe last year  with jalen green alpra and shen goon
KNl9UJkeEHM,8173520,8180320,josh christopher you traded away  christian wood to get rid of the veteran  and just build around this youth talent
KNl9UJkeEHM,8180320,8187119,and if you bring in  a guy like jabari smith he fits in at  that wing spot he's not the greatest
KNl9UJkeEHM,8187119,8194638,handler of the basketball that's fine  because jalen green can do that but you  get two guys who remind me a lot
KNl9UJkeEHM,8194638,8200399,of just guys who could put the bucket or  put the biscuit in the basket for for  jalen green it's like a bradley beale
KNl9UJkeEHM,8200399,8206880,type of player yeah and for jabari smith  it's a michael porter junior and once he  develops that handle that one-two punch
KNl9UJkeEHM,8206880,8214240,at those wing spots with green as well  as jabari smith is so intriguing and  uzman garubo last year at number 23 was
KNl9UJkeEHM,8214240,8219920,a great defensive player coming out of  spain where he was playing  internationally so i love the young
KNl9UJkeEHM,8219920,8226880,makings of this houston rockets team and  if they get jabari smith my gosh what a  selection for them the board fell in
KNl9UJkeEHM,8226880,8232638,their favor type me if you're subscribed  the chat sports and myself and chase  senior will give
KNl9UJkeEHM,8232638,8239598,some shout outs here and yeah just a  couple final thoughts on the rockets  there chase you added jabari smith here  as you continue this rebuild which i
KNl9UJkeEHM,8239598,8245040,think is the right move by houston then  you really just need your point card  long term yep we'll see who that ends up
KNl9UJkeEHM,8245040,8252319,being  quick note here i just saw come across  my timeline sean's reporting that the  magic did not have a formal workout or
KNl9UJkeEHM,8252319,8257678,meeting with banquero during the  pre-draft class interesting so something  just changed late
KNl9UJkeEHM,8257678,8264080,something like that i wonder if  something in jabari's background came up  that they didn't like or something or a
KNl9UJkeEHM,8264080,8269439,medical or who knows we'll find out i'm  sure i'm sure there will be some  reporting on really surprising we'll get
KNl9UJkeEHM,8269439,8276240,some shout outs here i don't know if  that's ever happened chase that number  one overall player goes to a team that  didn't work him out yeah i'd love to
KNl9UJkeEHM,8276240,8281359,know the history on that why wouldn't  they have worked him out either why not  do your due diligence on the prospect
KNl9UJkeEHM,8281359,8288800,bring him into the building to see what  he can do the magic had been bad for a  good reason chase  woj's wording which continues to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,8288800,8297598,hilarious auburn's jabari smith is a top  houston's draft board at number three  noob gaming says me jezedel says me mji
KNl9UJkeEHM,8297598,8304240,says me max for gazzo says me sean says  me cody atop the board that might be a
KNl9UJkeEHM,8304240,8311518,new one what's your favorite woad  synonym uh for they just made the pick  uh let us know
KNl9UJkeEHM,8311518,8316840,zeroing in on uh chase the god says me  that might be uh your burner account
KNl9UJkeEHM,8316840,8322399,chase says meme yeah boy says me keep it  coming in uh don't go anywhere draft's
KNl9UJkeEHM,8322399,8329920,still getting going uh no reason to dip  out now uh we're going with this uh  sounds like jabari smith gotta be the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8329920,8335200,pick here chase he's gonna go to houston  at number three and i think so far like
KNl9UJkeEHM,8335200,8340638,this is the best value picks uh early on  in the going yeah you look at our  scouting report forum this guy's an
KNl9UJkeEHM,8340638,8347359,awesome spot up shooter he knocked down  more than 40 percent of his three-point  opportunities last year with some volume
KNl9UJkeEHM,8347359,8355120,and awesome work ethic and a guy who  never backs down from contact a guy who  never backs down from competing a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,8355120,8361200,who if you tell him he has this and that  to work on he's going to get into the  lab and he's going to work on those
KNl9UJkeEHM,8361200,8369920,elements of his game so that he can  become a great player he's still only 19  years old 6 10 210 pounds a wiry bouncy
KNl9UJkeEHM,8369920,8375200,explosive athlete who has that high  release to his shot 17 points per game
KNl9UJkeEHM,8375200,8380319,last year seven and a half rebounds 42  from beyond the ark and a guy who over
KNl9UJkeEHM,8380319,8385359,time can become an elite high level  defender on top of what he can do on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8385359,8391680,offensive end now an area for him to  improve is certainly with this handle  but this guy number one player on my
KNl9UJkeEHM,8391680,8398800,board and for houston you get the number  one guy at number three overall to pair  up alongside jalen green you have your
KNl9UJkeEHM,8398800,8405359,two young superstars in h town and what  a turnaround for that organization you  traded away james harden you thought
KNl9UJkeEHM,8405359,8412080,that you were going to be in the abyss  in the nba for a couple of years they're  already climbing their way out of that
KNl9UJkeEHM,8412080,8418720,yeah and look it's not going to happen  overnight but you're getting this  nucleus now jalen green will see what  shane goon does now that they've traded
KNl9UJkeEHM,8418720,8423840,christian wood you had jabari smith here  continue to add some pieces once john
KNl9UJkeEHM,8423840,8430240,walls finally off their books next year  they'll have a lot more money that they  can spend so  if you're the rockets it'll take time
KNl9UJkeEHM,8430240,8435280,but they've got a lot of assets moving  forward in terms of draft capital abcdrf
KNl9UJkeEHM,8435280,8440880,grade the pick of jabari smith it's got  to be an a and listen we don't know  exactly what these guys will be until
KNl9UJkeEHM,8440880,8448319,they you know lace them up and play but  i think on paper this is an a selection  no doubt about it i agree by the way
KNl9UJkeEHM,8448319,8454479,jake fisher  sacramento remains in trade  conversations with the picket for
KNl9UJkeEHM,8454479,8460479,marshall green out there he's got his  heads on his hand  her hands on his head new york knicks
KNl9UJkeEHM,8460479,8467200,now host will the knicks trade up with  sacramento for a guy like jaden ivy the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8467200,8473359,trade rumors have been heavy around this  number four pick chase yeah no huge and  this has been the speculation and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8473359,8478960,buzz for a really long time  sacramento is in a spot where they're  not sure if they should go with the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,8478960,8484160,player available and jaden ivy when they  already have two guards and davion  mitchell who they drafted in the top ten
KNl9UJkeEHM,8484160,8490720,last year and d aaron fox who after the  tyreese haliburton trade averaged nearly  30 points per game last year and played
KNl9UJkeEHM,8490720,8497600,really well if you can get good value  back for the number for overall  selection whether it be moving back in
KNl9UJkeEHM,8497600,8502640,this draft or really good player capital  i could see sacramento's thinking i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,8502640,8508960,going best player available i'm trying  to build a special young core you messed  up the tyrese halliburton trade last
KNl9UJkeEHM,8508960,8515600,year i know that was the previous regime  but to build your team look at what the  warriors did they stockpiled young
KNl9UJkeEHM,8515600,8521120,talent that's the best way to get  yourself out of the depths of the nba  the kings have been there for nearly two
KNl9UJkeEHM,8521120,8527520,decades i don't like trading out i'd  take jaden ivy but that's me we're still  waiting as the sacramento kings are on
KNl9UJkeEHM,8527520,8533520,the clock  uh at this point t for trey k for keep  uh yes you vermouth says trade sebastian
KNl9UJkeEHM,8533520,8540399,says trade uh kent says keep uh delson  says keep michael says trade uh lesai
KNl9UJkeEHM,8540399,8546640,goes trade orlando saying keep asian  says uh keep lasago's trade we got dr
KNl9UJkeEHM,8546640,8552800,saying trade blake sand keep as well as  you let's take a look at the best  available you and i are in unison here
KNl9UJkeEHM,8552800,8558800,jayden ivey is the guy to draft here  regardless of if it's sacramento or any
KNl9UJkeEHM,8558800,8564160,other team trading but i think after ivy  there is a bit of a dip in terms of on
KNl9UJkeEHM,8564160,8570640,paper what these prospects are gonna be  i know you're a big benedict matheran  fan but ivy feels like the clear best
KNl9UJkeEHM,8570640,8577840,player available yeah jay knivey and  then benedict matheran is right there  behind him and both are exceptional
KNl9UJkeEHM,8577840,8584720,athletes  at that guard spot benedict matheran at  the wing and the sacramento king's pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,8584720,8590560,is in  i had a feeling they could go big guy  because of deiron fox and davion
KNl9UJkeEHM,8590560,8596720,mitchell on the team looks as though  they're gonna do that  sounds like keegan murray
KNl9UJkeEHM,8596720,8601760,the pick here for sacramento at number  four they're gonna go with the kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,8601760,8607120,stretch big out of iowa murray chase  who's one of the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,8607120,8613841,bigs in this scorers pure scores in this  draft  i just
KNl9UJkeEHM,8613920,8618960,i don't know man i like keegan murray  but this just feels like sacramento
KNl9UJkeEHM,8618960,8625439,going to sacramento like this is what  they do they they overthink everything  and look this guy's a bucket he could
KNl9UJkeEHM,8625439,8631520,absolutely score he can space the floor  as a six foot forward at 40 percent  three-point shooter he rebounds really
KNl9UJkeEHM,8631520,8638640,well for his size but  i just i don't know man i i would have  gone uh with jaden ivy here i would have
KNl9UJkeEHM,8638640,8645120,gone with jay navi because he was the  best player and again i don't care about  the aaron fox and davion mitchell i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,8645120,8652319,going to draft the best player i'm going  to figure it out later and then if you  have to trade one of them like a diary  and fox and move forward with daveon and
KNl9UJkeEHM,8652319,8657680,jane ivey as her young backcourt but for  keegan murray they drafted for fit they
KNl9UJkeEHM,8657680,8663800,are bereft of some premier players in  that front court and that's what keegan  murray can bring this basketball team at
KNl9UJkeEHM,8663800,8668960,6-8-2-15 moves a little bit better than  al horford only a sophomore last year
KNl9UJkeEHM,8668960,8677680,but he's a little bit older he's gonna  turn 22 here in a couple of months but  23 points per game 38 shooter from three
KNl9UJkeEHM,8677680,8684319,eight and a half rebounds two plus  blocks so he's really good defensively  as well  and i love his feel for the game i love
KNl9UJkeEHM,8684319,8690960,his hustle fran mccaffrey asked him to  do everything at iowa and he was very  successful in doing that an all-around
KNl9UJkeEHM,8690960,8698000,player also has shades of a little bit  of pascal ciaco because of his two-way  ability and a less athletic giannis
KNl9UJkeEHM,8698000,8703439,that's the type of player that we're  talking about here you watch him at six  eight he glides he's got really light
KNl9UJkeEHM,8703439,8708479,feet and because of that that's why he's  so good at playing the passing lanes and  blocking some shots then he's able to
KNl9UJkeEHM,8708479,8715840,knock down some triples with that really  clean stroke but the king's drafted for  fit here as compared to the best player
KNl9UJkeEHM,8715840,8722319,that's why i disagree with it we'll see  what happens with sacramento first four  picks are in and guess what detroit
KNl9UJkeEHM,8722319,8727600,discussing trading down possibilities  jaden ivy's still on the board
KNl9UJkeEHM,8727600,8735680,marshall and the knicks still could make  a move we'll see what happens on that  front palo van caro goes to orlando chat
KNl9UJkeEHM,8735680,8741920,home grin to oklahoma city jabari smith  to the houston rockets and then keegan  murray the latest selection to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,8741920,8749120,sacramento kings by the way one more  thought  does keeping  sabonis and
KNl9UJkeEHM,8749120,8754800,here's the other big for  sacramento sean holmes sean holmes thank  you  it kind of feels like holmes trade
KNl9UJkeEHM,8754800,8760800,rumors are about to heat up look and  this is why the trade of tyrese  haliburton for de monte sabonis didn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,8760800,8767120,really make a lot of sense now because  now you drafted another forward and  keegan murray
KNl9UJkeEHM,8767120,8773520,and i understand it's the previous  regime but  look  bad organizations are bad for a really
KNl9UJkeEHM,8773520,8779120,long time for a reason and the kings  have been in the depths of the nba for  two plus decades
KNl9UJkeEHM,8779120,8785840,um  i don't understand the selection i like  the player i would i just would have  went jane ivey because i think he can be
KNl9UJkeEHM,8785840,8791359,that good he reminds me fully of john  moran well help my boy chase get the 7

KNl9UJkeEHM,8838000,8843600,little bit later on as well and he just  told you he'll shotgun a beer if we get  to 7 000 twitter followers on his
KNl9UJkeEHM,8843600,8851200,account tonight give him a follow uh  we'll get that link in the live chat for  you guys all right who is the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,8851200,8856479,player available i think it's jaden ivy  all right looks as though the pistons
KNl9UJkeEHM,8856479,8862240,might select him after talking about a  potential trade  future backcourt of cade cunningham and
KNl9UJkeEHM,8862240,8867680,jane ivey they are already a huge draft  winner if that's the case yeah and uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,8867680,8874160,that is gonna be the pick here chase no  trade at least for now  jaden ivey to the detroit pistons at
KNl9UJkeEHM,8874160,8880720,number five overall  houston detroit couple good value  selections here early on yeah no really
KNl9UJkeEHM,8880720,8886080,good and for jay nivea this guy is an  absolutely dynamic athlete with great
KNl9UJkeEHM,8886080,8892399,shot creating and shot making ability  what i love about him his lack of fear  he's never scared to rise up and make a
KNl9UJkeEHM,8892399,8899359,big play in the guts of the game he is a  creative passer with the ball in his  hands but his decision making has to get
KNl9UJkeEHM,8899359,8905439,a little bit better  pretty solid defensively i'd like to see  him improve that just a bit and it
KNl9UJkeEHM,8905439,8913040,really comes down to consistency which  to me is really just overall effort but  for jay nivey this guy has so many
KNl9UJkeEHM,8913040,8919520,shades and is very reminiscent of john  morant with him just being a  breathtaking athlete in the half court
KNl9UJkeEHM,8919520,8925840,with his ability to split defenders get  to the rack and finish very creatively  but in the open floor this guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,8925840,8933280,is box office 17 points per game last  year for purdue  nearly five boards three dimes so you
KNl9UJkeEHM,8933280,8938479,look at the assist numbers and you're  like man he had the ball in his hands a  lot why didn't he average more assists
KNl9UJkeEHM,8938479,8944560,it's because he was asked to carry the  scoring load and some of his splash
KNl9UJkeEHM,8944560,8951040,assists were very very impressive but  again the consistency has to get a  little bit better but athletically this
KNl9UJkeEHM,8951040,8957760,guy can impact games right away from day  one you got any shout outs for us some  twitter followers oh my goodness so many
KNl9UJkeEHM,8957760,8962800,mike andrew jace reed jj big donch ace

KNl9UJkeEHM,8988319,8994080,live follow my boy at chase underscore  senior also  indiana pacers on the clock shout out
KNl9UJkeEHM,8994080,9000000,your favorite team we'll talk about the  first one we see count down from five  and i'll take a look five four
KNl9UJkeEHM,9000000,9005200,three two and one  i'm seeing the charlotte hornets chase
KNl9UJkeEHM,9005200,9011840,who have picks 13 and 15. indiana on the  clock right now we'll see what they're  up to here in a second but charlotte
KNl9UJkeEHM,9011840,9017520,with a couple of top 15 picks uh what do  you see as a couple of fits uh for them
KNl9UJkeEHM,9017520,9023760,uh coming up here in a little bit yeah  for charlotte  they need bigs so if you go mark
KNl9UJkeEHM,9023760,9029280,williams and jeremy sohan at 13 and 15.  that would be tremendous and for lamelo
KNl9UJkeEHM,9029280,9034319,ball two really good impactful players  who do things to impact winning
KNl9UJkeEHM,9034319,9040479,basketball games and for charlotte  that's what you're trying to do who's  going to be the head coach what's the  style going to be we're not sure because
KNl9UJkeEHM,9040479,9046640,kenny atkinson had fleeced them and  decided to go back to the golden state  warriors but for charlotte you've been  in the nba playing tournament
KNl9UJkeEHM,9046640,9052960,back-to-back years for that franchise  that's a significant stride forward how  do you get past that threshold though
KNl9UJkeEHM,9052960,9059200,need a better big need to get better  defensively wouldn't hate a shooting  wing on the perimeter not sure an elite
KNl9UJkeEHM,9059200,9065760,player like that is going to be  available at 13 and 15 but sohan mark  williams jalen duran a couple of players
KNl9UJkeEHM,9065760,9070880,who intrigue me if you are the hornets  we'll play this game one more time uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,9070880,9076560,talk about the first team that we see  five seconds chase four  three
KNl9UJkeEHM,9076560,9082560,two  and one who are we talking about here  see the new york knicks all right  they've been rumored to potentially
KNl9UJkeEHM,9082560,9088399,trade up they kind of feel like that  might have come and gone with jaden ivy  off the board now
KNl9UJkeEHM,9088399,9094720,uh but if you're the knicks i think a  couple of things one  is julius randle a part of this team or
KNl9UJkeEHM,9094720,9100800,not you gotta figure that gotta figure  that out um and two in terms of the  draft tonight at 11 let's say they stand
KNl9UJkeEHM,9100800,9108800,there who are a couple of names in the  mix there i know jalen during has been  rumored as a possibility he's also in  the mix at number nine to san antonio um
KNl9UJkeEHM,9108800,9115600,i don't know how i feel about that i  understand because mitchell robinson is  a free agent i'd rather resign him and
KNl9UJkeEHM,9115600,9122319,then just get the best player overall  because i still think the knicks just  need good young talent i think they also  need a score which is why i think aj
KNl9UJkeEHM,9122319,9129600,griffin out of duke would make a lot of  sense he's one of the best scorers in  this class but defensively he's like a  traffic cone man he was so bad for duke
KNl9UJkeEHM,9129600,9136000,at many moments last year has perimeter  shooting though last year was really  good with his three-point stroke now
KNl9UJkeEHM,9136000,9142880,what's interesting he has this wide base  to him so sometimes it looks really  weird but on 123 point attempts last
KNl9UJkeEHM,9142880,9149040,year he knocked down about 48 of those  opportunities that's a very elite number  shot about 76 percent from the free
KNl9UJkeEHM,9149040,9155280,throw line obviously 48 from downtown is  not sustainable 10 points per game one
KNl9UJkeEHM,9155280,9160560,assist really what he would be brought  in to do is be a high level scorer and  for the next that's what they need the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9160560,9166720,concerns with aj griffin missed two  years of high school basketball because  of knee and ankle injuries
KNl9UJkeEHM,9166720,9172880,medical red flags with him but if he can  stay healthy this guy can be a creative  bucket getter at the nba level while we
KNl9UJkeEHM,9172880,9179439,await for the pacers pick here at number  six join the family here at chat sports  nba coverage nfl college football and

KNl9UJkeEHM,9227200,9235040,five mike dibble always bringing the  heat appreciate your uh fine work uh  tuning in tonight as well uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,9235040,9240479,wrong uh pick on the clock here sam but  indiana at six uh looks like the pick is
KNl9UJkeEHM,9240479,9245520,in benedict matheran chase one of your  pet projects here one of the better
KNl9UJkeEHM,9245520,9252240,wings in this class i love benedict  matherin i love his story coming from  canada grew up in not the most ideal
KNl9UJkeEHM,9252240,9259120,situation but was able to overcome  adversity and at arizona  20 years old sophomore made some nice
KNl9UJkeEHM,9259120,9266319,adjustments from his first year to his  second year  and developed into a really good  knockdown shooter with some shot making
KNl9UJkeEHM,9266319,9272800,ability off the dribble needs to do a  little bit of work as a passer and as a  defender and i like to see him tighten
KNl9UJkeEHM,9272800,9278880,his handle a little bit but when you  talk about premium athletes in the  league this is what benedict matherin is
KNl9UJkeEHM,9278880,9284880,and it's one of the most important  attributes that i look for in a lot of  these prospects because that allows you
KNl9UJkeEHM,9284880,9291439,to stay in the league for a really long  time he can score off the dribble he can  shoot right off the catch which is
KNl9UJkeEHM,9291439,9297760,immediately going to allow him to impact  games right away at the nba level i  think he profiles best as a secondary
KNl9UJkeEHM,9297760,9303840,playmaker which is fine for indiana  right now because he doesn't need to be  that primary guy but over time does he
KNl9UJkeEHM,9303840,9310240,have the potential to be that type of  guy a number one score i'm not sure  about that but a very good number two
KNl9UJkeEHM,9310240,9316720,who if he becomes a better defender can  become a premium two-way threat yeah i  think he's got a clean
KNl9UJkeEHM,9316720,9323040,jump shot i think the efficiency will  improve as he gets older uh in the nba  the first of three selections for
KNl9UJkeEHM,9323040,9328319,indiana tonight they also have the first  pick of the second round at 31  and then they select uh with the final

KNl9UJkeEHM,9464160,9469439,green's gonna lose his mind the knicks  get jaden knives oh yeah let's talk  about the portland trailblazers here
KNl9UJkeEHM,9469439,9475040,chase they're on the clock there's been  a lot of buzz could they trade this pick  could they keep it ognenobi for seven
KNl9UJkeEHM,9475040,9480399,straight up has been rumored out there  portland's in an interesting spot  because they go get jeremy grant is the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9480399,9485520,guy that can help damien lillard but you  feel like there's still at least a piece  or two away from really contending in
KNl9UJkeEHM,9485520,9490960,the west what are you doing here you  keeping this pick you trading it what  would you do i would personally trade it
KNl9UJkeEHM,9490960,9497200,for ogn and obi and for toronto there's  been a lot of buzz about og not really  being happy with the situation in
KNl9UJkeEHM,9497200,9502479,toronto i'm not sure why that's a  basketball haven  they have done such a great job right up
KNl9UJkeEHM,9502479,9509600,there with the miami heat of developing  players over time and the history is  certainly along there and ogn and obi
KNl9UJkeEHM,9509600,9516080,has been the byproduct of that raptors  culture now if he wants out and doesn't  see himself as a long-term fit and
KNl9UJkeEHM,9516080,9522240,toronto doesn't see themselves as  necessarily being  the most competitive top four top five
KNl9UJkeEHM,9522240,9528240,team in the eastern conference do they  trade this away get number seven where  there's still some really good players
KNl9UJkeEHM,9528240,9534880,on the board they need another score  that's why shane sharp would make a lot  of sense if that is the case so if on
KNl9UJkeEHM,9534880,9540080,the blazers jeremy grant win now move  ogn and obi helps you win right now you
KNl9UJkeEHM,9540080,9545920,brought back damien lillard you traded  away cj mccullum to tinker with that  roster a little bit they're not looking
KNl9UJkeEHM,9545920,9550960,to win in five years they're looking to  win right now with dame i'll be honest i  wouldn't mind johnny davis here that
KNl9UJkeEHM,9550960,9556319,could play the two next to dame yeah  good defender he can also  they asked him to be a high volume
KNl9UJkeEHM,9556319,9562160,player at wisconsin i think if the  volume goes down the efficiency would go  up yeah um i wouldn't mind that fit um
KNl9UJkeEHM,9562160,9568800,next to dame so we'll see what happens  here at seven who should the blazers  draft let us know down in the comments
KNl9UJkeEHM,9568800,9574240,uh chat uh or troy says kai soto from  the philippines yeah we're monitoring
KNl9UJkeEHM,9574240,9580960,kai don't worry aj griffin from tucker  uh shaden sharp from sportsy uh we got
KNl9UJkeEHM,9580960,9587520,uh henry drell  dyson daniels  let's see
KNl9UJkeEHM,9587520,9594240,who else uh shaden sharp from jordan  we'll find out portland on the clock  here at seven do you think sharp is the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9594240,9600960,best player available  um in my opinion you know he's certainly  right up there and obviously he's the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9600960,9607280,biggest question mark of this draft  because we haven't seen him play since  high school yeah so we don't really know  how he matches up against elite level
KNl9UJkeEHM,9607280,9612960,competition i do think that he can  become an elite level scorer and in my  opinion that's the most important trait
KNl9UJkeEHM,9612960,9620080,that you're looking for in a draft  prospect right now and he would help the  blazers a lot  with that scoring offensive ability if
KNl9UJkeEHM,9620080,9626880,you want to go a derrick white type you  go dyson daniels here or if you want to  fulfill that need for a big you can go
KNl9UJkeEHM,9626880,9632880,with jalen duran or another big jeremy  sohan would be interesting because i  think he can play right away because he
KNl9UJkeEHM,9632880,9638880,wouldn't be asked to do much offensively  which is fine for him because he impacts  the game in a variety of other areas no
KNl9UJkeEHM,9638880,9643920,trades as of yet we got a super chat  from luke luna uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,9643920,9651520,go 49ers my jazz zero picks hey senior  appreciate 49ers reporter shout out to  you that's right appreciate it luke uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,9651520,9658800,by the way we do have a super chat menu  uh all super chats we get a beer cheers  to you so sips up to luke
KNl9UJkeEHM,9658800,9664399,cheers for five bucks we'll talk about  your favorite team 10 bucks we'll spin  the roulette wheel 20 dollars we'll take
KNl9UJkeEHM,9664399,9671120,a shot of fireball or someone will and  for a hundred dollars someone will  either shotgun a beer or take a beer
KNl9UJkeEHM,9671120,9676560,bonk so appreciate that as well  portland's on the clock every 100 bucks
KNl9UJkeEHM,9676560,9682160,in super chats as well we'll spin the  roulette wheel so we're less than 30  away from doing that and the roulette
KNl9UJkeEHM,9682160,9689520,wheel basically is  it's a roulette wheel with different  challenges depending on where the  ping-pong ball lands so keep that in
KNl9UJkeEHM,9689520,9694640,mind as we move forward sounds like the  pick is in here chase uh it's gonna be
KNl9UJkeEHM,9694640,9701600,shade and sharp to the portland  trailblazer i just got done saying i  thought that shane sharp made a lot of  sense if they hold on to this selection
KNl9UJkeEHM,9701600,9707680,i could see him coming in right away as  that hyper  bench scorer who can go on these
KNl9UJkeEHM,9707680,9714560,microwave runs that really are  incredible now shane sharp coming out of  high school number one consensus player
KNl9UJkeEHM,9714560,9720160,reclassified went to kentucky in january  but never played  but when people would go to watch
KNl9UJkeEHM,9720160,9726560,kentucky practices they were blown away  by the ability and the potential of  sharp working on the side with some
KNl9UJkeEHM,9726560,9732720,coaches there and the wide belief is is  that if you went back to kentucky to  play for john calipari he would have
KNl9UJkeEHM,9732720,9739279,been the number one player in the 2023  draft class so opted to sit out this  season and because of that we really
KNl9UJkeEHM,9739279,9744960,haven't seen him since his final high  school year in the eybl circuit going up  against some of the best high school
KNl9UJkeEHM,9744960,9751200,talent this guy was just an incredible  scorer a great shooter with the  athleticism the finish above the rim but
KNl9UJkeEHM,9751200,9758160,also because of that athleticism he can  get a shot off from anywhere an  excellent player who again
KNl9UJkeEHM,9758160,9765279,for the blazers can come in on that  second unit lead that second unit in the  scoring department and over time learn
KNl9UJkeEHM,9765279,9772319,from one of the best offensive players  that we've ever seen in damien lillard  by the way we just broke down that  entire pick and adrian wojnarowski just
KNl9UJkeEHM,9772319,9778640,tweeted that the blazers are focused in  on uh shade and sharp this is why you  subscribe because we have the picks uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,9778640,9784479,before they do abcdrf grade the pick uh  of shade and sharp uh we got the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9784479,9790960,pelicans on the clock here uh so stay  tuned uh no trades yet chase
KNl9UJkeEHM,9790960,9797040,report that the knicks could be making a  move for jaden ivy with detroit but as  of now no trade yet and by the way

KNl9UJkeEHM,9881600,9886720,just a moment let's talk about the  pelicans here or let's get yeah we'll  talk about the pelicans we got a couple
KNl9UJkeEHM,9886720,9893439,supers we'll get to uh but uh pelly's on  the clock here at number eight chase  what are you looking at here a team that
KNl9UJkeEHM,9893439,9898479,may not be as far away as we think  especially if zion comes back and  healthy yeah some light buzz leading
KNl9UJkeEHM,9898479,9905040,into the draft that oozman jiang could  be the player here really intriguing  player who has the length of a brand in
KNl9UJkeEHM,9905040,9911359,ingram but unfortunately for him  and the team that drafts him he doesn't  have the efficiency scoring the
KNl9UJkeEHM,9911359,9916960,basketball that brandon ingram has now i  understand that coming out of duke  ingram wasn't this fine-tuned product
KNl9UJkeEHM,9916960,9922560,and in the playoffs everybody finally  realized that brandon ingram is a better  player than ben simmons and is one of
KNl9UJkeEHM,9922560,9929279,the best young scorers in the nba  jang might be able to become that over  time but he's extremely raw right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,9929279,9936080,and his shooting percentages were really  bad playing for the new zealand breakers  in the nbl the length the athleticism is
KNl9UJkeEHM,9936080,9942160,there at times you've watched the tape  and you see him hit these step back  threes and with that length he has that
KNl9UJkeEHM,9942160,9947359,high release and you're like my goodness  if you look at the highlights  it looks like a top five player in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,9947359,9953279,class yeah but then you actually watch  the games and you see him get lost at  moments and then you see some of these
KNl9UJkeEHM,9953279,9958880,ill-advised shot attempts and you  finally realize why he might be slipping  a little bit all right let's go to
KNl9UJkeEHM,9958880,9965680,jeremy and then the pick is in here so  we'll get to that jeremy let's take this  irish com bar you're on jeremy
KNl9UJkeEHM,9965680,9972810,oh i'm on i'm on okay mitch's  mitch has my iris car bomb ready let's  go donkey
KNl9UJkeEHM,9972810,9978240,[Laughter]  jeremy chugs is the energy of the that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,9978240,9983920,why you subscribe baby that's why you  subscribe jeremy right there the energy
KNl9UJkeEHM,9983920,9989120,of chat sports they got sports the  culture of chat sports superman he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,9989120,9997279,rocking and rolling we got a pick to get  to here chase appreciate it chase dire  chugs tyson daniels yeah the pick here
KNl9UJkeEHM,9997279,10002479,instant reaction yeah so this is the  other player that we talked about  potentially going here he's only 19
KNl9UJkeEHM,10002479,10007760,years old really good aussie player who  played for the g-league ignite and when
KNl9UJkeEHM,10007760,10013200,you watch the g-league ignite it's a  bunch of other players who are trying to  get buckets and impress everybody
KNl9UJkeEHM,10013200,10019040,offensively and they don't give much  effort defensively right for dyson  daniels it was the complete opposite you
KNl9UJkeEHM,10019040,10024640,could tell that he was trying to make  winning plays impact the game in the  right way
KNl9UJkeEHM,10024640,10030640,athleticism to become a very very good  defender  he really needs to improve on his
KNl9UJkeEHM,10030640,10037600,three-point shot it was not good there's  a little bit of a hitch in it the  consistency isn't there is a good passer
KNl9UJkeEHM,10037600,10043680,who can thrive in the pick and roll  makes the right plays as i said a great  defender who can switch who can guard
KNl9UJkeEHM,10043680,10048800,multiple positions but his shooting  needs plenty of work in the nba and with
KNl9UJkeEHM,10048800,10055760,the g-league ignite averages of 11  points per game six rebounds but the  shooting percentages just weren't good
KNl9UJkeEHM,10055760,10062000,sub 35 percent from the floor and that's  not gonna cut it but  he's going to a good location there's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10062000,10067120,not going to be pressure on him to  immediately be an impact player he's  going to an upstart team in the league
KNl9UJkeEHM,10067120,10072640,where he can come in off the bench and  the focus isn't going to be on him and  he can play the role of derrick white
KNl9UJkeEHM,10072640,10079840,that white played for boston and be that  guy who does all the extra stuff without  having to fulfill the scoring department
KNl9UJkeEHM,10079840,10086560,spurs on the clock here we got a five  dollar from lmac or imac i'm not sure if  that's an l or an i can we talk about
KNl9UJkeEHM,10086560,10091600,johnny zhu zang and why he isn't a first  round pick  he went back to school last year chase
KNl9UJkeEHM,10091600,10098880,and he didn't really improve no he  didn't much and i i i kind of like the  three-point shot um johnny giuseng can
KNl9UJkeEHM,10098880,10106800,play a little bit but he's not an elite  level athlete and i wouldn't say he does  anything great he's just pretty good but
KNl9UJkeEHM,10106800,10113680,as a rotation player in the second round  i actually think the value could be  pretty solid  tv appreciate the ten dollars get that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10113680,10120000,roulette wheel ready any thoughts about  kai soto oh we've got thoughts we've got  and we've got a lot of videos that have
KNl9UJkeEHM,10120000,10126240,gone out so  uh  quick thoughts before we get to uh the  liddy cam here on kai soto yeah he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10126240,10132000,just a little bit slow and i'd like to  see him take more three-point shots to  stretch the floor a little bit nice
KNl9UJkeEHM,10132000,10138240,stroke average point eight blocks per  game with the adelaide 36 years by the  way the nbl very good level of
KNl9UJkeEHM,10138240,10143600,competition  what's happening  i don't know what just happened  something just happened now seems just
KNl9UJkeEHM,10143600,10150399,spin the wheel let's go to the lid  cam  patrick is on here patrick you're on all
KNl9UJkeEHM,10150399,10157279,right now we're on all right we got the  beer boot  subscribe button that's that's three
KNl9UJkeEHM,10157279,10162640,beer beers  hey this is still for kevin durant come  to chicago i'm hoping
KNl9UJkeEHM,10162640,10166199,hold mount hole
KNl9UJkeEHM,10178399,10181641,good recovery
KNl9UJkeEHM,10185359,10190399,there he goes he leaves the liddy cam  and uh we're lit because of it and hey
KNl9UJkeEHM,10190399,10195680,that's what 10 super chats can get you  that's what tim oh mitchell oh no he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10195680,10200800,just walking did seeps need a new jacket  does he need a good thing he had the  windbreaker on because that deflects
KNl9UJkeEHM,10200800,10207439,some of the voices true he's good to go  great that  it was a good recovery chase it was a
KNl9UJkeEHM,10207439,10214160,good recovery i'll give it a passing  grade c plus on the choke yeah c plus  the recovery was good it is difficult to
KNl9UJkeEHM,10214160,10219200,chug though you have to  kind of it's a wash it's a little wide  right in the foot you got to do that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10219200,10224399,little oh that bubble hits you too it's  uh it's tough yeah it's tough uh phoenix
KNl9UJkeEHM,10224399,10230000,says b f from ronnie tough crowd ryan  says d  c from jordan
KNl9UJkeEHM,10230000,10237840,b from c for recovery from  a  c for recovery uh kai soto equals darko
KNl9UJkeEHM,10237840,10244560,milicic taco military is the number two  overall pick yeah so i don't think  that's fair uh raymond says c weenie
KNl9UJkeEHM,10244560,10249600,says a two dollar super chat from  surfing appreciate that by the way mark
KNl9UJkeEHM,10249600,10255680,stein reports uh  in in response to jake fisher's report  of the knicks pursuing jaden ivy that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10255680,10261760,that could depend on if jalen duran is  on the board at 11. there's been some  buzz the knicks like him there if he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10261760,10267120,available they'll probably just draft  him if not maybe they'll swing a trade  for jade knight or could it be detroit
KNl9UJkeEHM,10267120,10272560,wanting  potentially jalen duran potentially yeah  that could be it too shall see joe
KNl9UJkeEHM,10272560,10279120,simpson thoughts on why the raptors  didn't trade og adobe for portland's  seventh uh overall pick i'm guessing
KNl9UJkeEHM,10279120,10285760,that uh one of the two teams didn't like  the value well enough i mean i don't  know what other reason there would be
KNl9UJkeEHM,10285760,10291279,so pistons keeping jaden ivy they're  keeping jade that's according to james
KNl9UJkeEHM,10291279,10296720,edwards iii marshall has his head in his  hands but mark stein retweeted it so
KNl9UJkeEHM,10296720,10302800,yeah it looks as though that's legit  james edwards iii  covers the pistons for the athletics so
KNl9UJkeEHM,10302800,10308960,take that for what it's worth all right  let's talk about the spurs a bit here uh  picked josh primo last year youngest
KNl9UJkeEHM,10308960,10315120,player on the draft traded derek white  there's been some buzz what is dejante  murray's future uh but they got three
KNl9UJkeEHM,10315120,10321840,picks in the first round tonight we'll  see what they do  yeah and for san antonio they've kind of  been irrelevant for a long time but this
KNl9UJkeEHM,10321840,10329040,is an opportunity to kind of rejuvenate  that roster to a certain degree and if  you can build around dejante murray
KNl9UJkeEHM,10329040,10334880,that's ideal if you want to use them as  a trade trip around the nba trade  deadline you can do that too and get a
KNl9UJkeEHM,10334880,10340080,fat package back but number nine 20 and  25  they're also drafting in the second
KNl9UJkeEHM,10340080,10348560,round at 38 you get some really good  value there as well what are you  laughing at marshall green quote tweeted  james edwards and said f you james
KNl9UJkeEHM,10348560,10353840,yeah it's all james edward's fault that  jaden ivy's not gonna be a nick all
KNl9UJkeEHM,10353840,10360800,right we gotta go sub only chat that's  what we've been told uh blame the bosses  the bigwigs brett scott james yoder

KNl9UJkeEHM,10434880,10441680,sports og happy chat also in the chat  right by the way uh jeremy uh the guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,10441680,10446800,who just chugged uh drink or the car or  irish car bomb
KNl9UJkeEHM,10446800,10453600,made a uh did you see this philippines  mount rushmore it's you me uh manny  pacquiao and kai soto where did he put
KNl9UJkeEHM,10453600,10458720,that and uh hq yeah that's good stuff  that is fine all right best available aj
KNl9UJkeEHM,10458720,10465439,griffin who you talked about a little  bit is a good score but doesn't do much  on the defensive end i actually like  johnny davis a little more i i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,10465439,10471760,he's the best player on the board for me  um i just think he's good defensively he  can really score
KNl9UJkeEHM,10471760,10479200,if he's got guys around him he was asked  to do so much at wisconsin last yeah he  was yeah no and here's the thing too it
KNl9UJkeEHM,10479200,10485120,looks as though  it could be jeremy sohan yeah it sounds  like i don't really really like pick  um
KNl9UJkeEHM,10485120,10490720,there was a lot of buzz about jalen  duran they were targeting biggs  obviously because sohan fits that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10490720,10496800,prototype he's more of a four durhan is  a five but jeremy sohan out of baylor is
KNl9UJkeEHM,10496800,10501920,going to be the pick and honestly oh 50  super chat we'll get to that in a second
KNl9UJkeEHM,10501920,10508560,let's break down the pick first yeah  sohan the selection here at number nine  lands with san antonio and producer sam
KNl9UJkeEHM,10508560,10513680,cash is another uh pre-draft bet yeah  six nine 230 pounds can guard multiple
KNl9UJkeEHM,10513680,10519840,positions when he was putting switches  he actually fared really well he's one  of my favorite players in this class
KNl9UJkeEHM,10519840,10526080,because he does everything at a pretty  elite level outside of scoring the  basketball but i had an opportunity to
KNl9UJkeEHM,10526080,10531359,watch him live at the ncaa tournament i  saw the three-point stroke he knocked  down a couple of threes in the first
KNl9UJkeEHM,10531359,10537520,round and then in the second round  against unc and i said this guy's really  good now he can impact games from the
KNl9UJkeEHM,10537520,10543760,high post passing the ball finding  backdoor cutters like a draymond green  he can defend like a ben simmons at that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10543760,10549680,four spot has a little bit of sean  marion to his game as well an excellent  defender at the end of the day who can
KNl9UJkeEHM,10549680,10555120,really hold his own against all five  positions which goes back to my point if  he's stuck in a switch he could play
KNl9UJkeEHM,10555120,10561200,really well a perfect spurs player as  well because you know that greg popovich  is going to put him in a bunch of
KNl9UJkeEHM,10561200,10568319,positions in which he is going to be at  his best to maximize his game and if he  can develop a shot this guy is the
KNl9UJkeEHM,10568319,10574960,absolute limit for jeremy sohan a great  pick for the san antonio spurs i  absolutely love it washington wizards on
KNl9UJkeEHM,10574960,10581120,the clock at number 10 a little uptick  in audience subscribe if you haven't  already ronnie marshall five bucks let's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10581120,10587200,get a raiders boot or 50 bucks sorry  let's get a raiders boot from mitch and  what do you guys think about the bucks
KNl9UJkeEHM,10587200,10593279,well we could talk about the bucks while  mitchell wrens gets ready or is he ready  all right we're gonna go to mitchell
KNl9UJkeEHM,10593279,10600240,wren's now at the liddy cam with a boot  we'll get to washington and the bucks in  a sec mitch what's up guys shout out to
KNl9UJkeEHM,10600240,10609120,ronnie cheers to everyone watching let's  get this boot going all right mitch  mitch mitch mitch mitch mitch
KNl9UJkeEHM,10609120,10615359,mitch mitch  mitch  slow pace but no spillage
KNl9UJkeEHM,10615359,10621349,keep it going champ mitch in the chat  [Music]
KNl9UJkeEHM,10622640,10628560,he's so close come on mitch finish  strong buddy
KNl9UJkeEHM,10628560,10634720,no spillage  there he goes shout out to ronnie for  the 50 piece oh we've crossed 300s
KNl9UJkeEHM,10634720,10640800,that's a is that a that's a free spin  we'll go back to the liddycam we got to  spin the wheel in a minute let's talk
KNl9UJkeEHM,10640800,10645840,about the wizards or the bucks sorry he  asked about the box chase wizards on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,10645840,10652880,clock milwaukee  lost in seven obviously to the celtics  in the second round but this is still a
KNl9UJkeEHM,10652880,10658720,win now uh  team chris middleton being hurt hurt  their title chances uh during the
KNl9UJkeEHM,10658720,10664000,playoffs are you looking for anything to  do this offseason if you're milwaukee
KNl9UJkeEHM,10664000,10670399,yeah if you're milwaukee pat connaughton  is going to come back and get
KNl9UJkeEHM,10670479,10677200,look if the bucks had chris middleton do  they beat the boston celtics in the  second round of the eastern conference  playoffs i think they do yeah and if
KNl9UJkeEHM,10677200,10682880,that's the case how do they match up  against a team like the miami heat  pretty favorably and then how do they  match up against the golden state
KNl9UJkeEHM,10682880,10688800,warriors is anybody on the dubs matching  up against giannis so i don't really  think the bucks have to do all that much
KNl9UJkeEHM,10688800,10693920,no a player to come in and lead that  second unit scoring the basketball after
KNl9UJkeEHM,10693920,10700399,drew holiday i think is a big need for  them in free agency well johnny davis  the next selection here he goes the  wizards one of my favorite players in
KNl9UJkeEHM,10700399,10705840,the class needs to be a little more  efficient but he was asked to do a lot  at wisconsin i think he's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,10705840,10712479,elite perimeter defender it can guard  multiple positions i think he can run  some point in a in a pinch if needed i
KNl9UJkeEHM,10712479,10718640,think he's more of a two guard though  chase uh i like this kid i i think he's  he's got a good head on his shoulders
KNl9UJkeEHM,10718640,10724640,he's got a chance to be really good in  the nba yeah you can make the argument  that johnny davis was the best scorer in
KNl9UJkeEHM,10724640,10730800,college basketball last year he's a  bucket getting guard who has an old  school game because he flourishes from
KNl9UJkeEHM,10730800,10735840,the mid-range and we don't often see  that in today's three-point happy nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,10735840,10742960,can play excellent defense but needs to  improve his shooting because you look at  the shooting splits 33 plus percent from
KNl9UJkeEHM,10742960,10748319,three  seventy eight percent from the free  throw line though and i like the  indicator of a good shooter i think he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10748319,10753359,a better scoring jalen suggs that's kind  of my pro comp for him eight rebounds
KNl9UJkeEHM,10753359,10760560,two so at six four eight rebounds is a  pretty solid number  he's not the best athlete so is that
KNl9UJkeEHM,10760560,10767279,defense going to be as good as it was at  the college ranks with wisconsin we'll  see but he is a tough shot maker and if
KNl9UJkeEHM,10767279,10773200,bradley beal comes back this pick makes  a lot of sense because i think that  johnny davis can be a plug and play
KNl9UJkeEHM,10773200,10778640,player from day one a lot of  anticipation now chase for what the new  york knicks will do at 11 we'll break
KNl9UJkeEHM,10778640,10784000,that down in a moment but trace is on  and uh we go back to the liddicam for
KNl9UJkeEHM,10784000,10790080,another roulette spin  take it away trace all right  got a fireball shot let's get i'll take
KNl9UJkeEHM,10790080,10796960,party started let's get it going i'll  take one with you trace let's go graham  let's get me
KNl9UJkeEHM,10798000,10804479,yeah hang on we're gonna do uh for trace  we're gonna trace it up here that's what  we're gonna do three shots trace and
KNl9UJkeEHM,10804479,10811840,chase taking shots cheers  two  one
KNl9UJkeEHM,10814240,10821040,appreciate that every hundred bucks is a  bonus roulette spin obviously every ten  dollar super chat gets that as well
KNl9UJkeEHM,10821040,10827279,chase with the knicks on the clock  we'll get to this super chat then we'll  talk about a potential pick here
KNl9UJkeEHM,10827279,10833920,what did the knicks do here i you know  jose perfect super chat you know nick's  on the clock perfect timing here
KNl9UJkeEHM,10833920,10839120,you know they wanted there was interest  in moving up for jaden ivy sounds like  that's not going to happen he has a lot
KNl9UJkeEHM,10839120,10844960,of jalen duran connection here is that  the pick in your eyes that would signal  mitchell robinson leaving i think i
KNl9UJkeEHM,10844960,10851520,think the other player in play here is  aj griffin who's one of the best scorers  in this draft class 48 from three last
KNl9UJkeEHM,10851520,10857600,year with duke  only about 11 points per game so the  volume wasn't there but you have to  consider who he was playing with yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,10857600,10863920,kiehl's bank caro mark williams that  team was stacked and a couple of second  round guys who could also get selected
KNl9UJkeEHM,10863920,10869760,so if you're new york i like aj griffin  because again i'm going wings over bigs
KNl9UJkeEHM,10869760,10875359,but if you think mitchell robinson isn't  going to come back and you want to  fulfill that need by going during and
KNl9UJkeEHM,10875359,10880800,you don't have trust that nerlins noel  can stay healthy then that pick makes  some sense yeah we'll see what happens
KNl9UJkeEHM,10880800,10886240,here by the way a little sub battle you  and marsh going back and forth the whole  time of this channel existence that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,10886240,10893040,been neck and neck yeah what a great  idea it was to launch these channels  knicks now with 6600 subs 76ers just on
KNl9UJkeEHM,10893040,10899040,their heels just under 100 behind so if  you're a knicks fan subscribe  youtube.comnixtv
KNl9UJkeEHM,10899040,10904319,the link is right there marshall green  actually getting ready to go in one of  our other studios to break down whoever
KNl9UJkeEHM,10904319,10910560,this pick is so if you want more deeper  analysis on that pick that'll be out  probably in the next 20 minutes or so so
KNl9UJkeEHM,10910560,10915760,stay tuned for that sixers fans uh we  could flash that link out down below to
KNl9UJkeEHM,10915760,10923200,uh youtube.com 76ers tv we'll watch  these channels what about nine months  ago ten months ago about that uh last
KNl9UJkeEHM,10923200,10928240,year  uh and uh they've been doing really well  and uh chase is doing a great job with
KNl9UJkeEHM,10928240,10934720,our sixers coverage march with our uh  knicks coverage and with the nba  offseason here if you're a fan of those  teams you should go ahead and subscribe
KNl9UJkeEHM,10934720,10941200,all right so nick's on the clock and um  i i'm kind of with you it feels like one  of these top two guys aj griffin or
KNl9UJkeEHM,10941200,10946880,jalen during as we look at our best  available here yeah they're the best  available players right now and they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,10946880,10952960,the best fits for the new york knicks  and for griffin you get a really good  scoring wing the medicals are important
KNl9UJkeEHM,10952960,10958960,here missed two years of high school  basketball with knee and ankle injuries  if you want to go with jalen duren
KNl9UJkeEHM,10958960,10965279,really good athlete who my pro cop for  him kind of robert williams and we saw  how impactful robert williams was for
KNl9UJkeEHM,10965279,10972080,the celtics throughout their entire  playoff run and that's when he was less  than 100 healthy switches rim protection
KNl9UJkeEHM,10972080,10977680,alley-oops block shots that's what  durham can bring to the table i don't  think they really surprise anybody and
KNl9UJkeEHM,10977680,10983439,go nikola jovich here i think it's  either one of durhan or griffin it's a  little bit early for these players on
KNl9UJkeEHM,10983439,10988960,your screen here  dude trade down i mean  i would consider it maybe if you don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,10988960,10995680,love the options here and there's been  reports that the knicks could trade down  try to manipulate their cap a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,10995680,11001680,and go make a run to the guy like jalen  brunson who's expected to resign with  dallas but if he were to leave the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11001680,11007920,knicks sound like the front runner in  terms of if he leaves dallas could go  sign with new york yeah and and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11007920,11014319,knicks have some big free agency plans  that they probably have on their  off-season checklist
KNl9UJkeEHM,11014319,11021120,but what they did last year they they  went star hunting they were in on chris  paul i believe kyle lowry they didn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,11021120,11027680,get those guys so they settled for those  middle tier players they're gonna go big  fish hunting for jalen brunson and they
KNl9UJkeEHM,11027680,11032880,might even try to overpay for jalen  brunson but for brunson's sake makes  sense for you to just come back to
KNl9UJkeEHM,11032880,11038479,dallas because you have something  special working with luka doncic so  um
KNl9UJkeEHM,11038479,11043920,we'll see what the knicks do here if  they trade out i just want to see them  get another young impactful player and i
KNl9UJkeEHM,11043920,11049760,think griffin  is a good guy to get here you have rj  barrett emmanuel quickly obi topping
KNl9UJkeEHM,11049760,11055439,started to turn the corner at the end of  the year do you go big and jalen duren  wing and aj griffin that's really what
KNl9UJkeEHM,11055439,11063200,it comes down to for me who's the best  pick so  far  in this draft ah i think it's either ivy
KNl9UJkeEHM,11063200,11068800,detroit or probably jabari smith right  that feels like the best pick to houston  at number three but obviously there's
KNl9UJkeEHM,11068800,11075520,been a lot of good ones early on here  yeah for sure and  you know with the how the board fell i
KNl9UJkeEHM,11075520,11081920,think the houston rockets big winner so  far they get jabari smith at number  three and they seem to be pretty content
KNl9UJkeEHM,11081920,11088479,with going with one of the three  remaining players of holmgren banquero  and smith they luck out with jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,11088479,11094880,smith who in my opinion number one  player in this draft class and i think  he can play alongside uh jalen greene
KNl9UJkeEHM,11094880,11101120,and the rockets look they trade away  james harden they're like my goodness  we're gonna be a basketball purgatory  for a really long time
KNl9UJkeEHM,11101120,11106240,doesn't look as though that's gonna be  the case they are building something  special there in h town gotten some good

KNl9UJkeEHM,11200479,11206000,jabari smith was gonna be the number one  pick  wow new york knicks pick is in
KNl9UJkeEHM,11206000,11211760,oozeman jang is going to be the  selection at number 11 for the new york
KNl9UJkeEHM,11211760,11218560,knicks i thought it was one of two  between aj griffin and jaylen durhan and  the knicks are going with jang here
KNl9UJkeEHM,11218560,11224399,we'll take the shot to celebrate the new  york knicks selection and for everybody  watching us cheers to the audience and
KNl9UJkeEHM,11224399,11231359,we'll break down jang as we have a  couple of minutes here harry you gonna  take that shot yeah i'm gonna well we  got to be on camera when we talk okay
KNl9UJkeEHM,11231359,11236720,let's talk about zhang first then then  we'll by the way  have fun getting to eight marsh for uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,11236720,11242319,but uh talk about the prospect a little  bit uh you said earlier a little bit raw
KNl9UJkeEHM,11242319,11248479,so raw so what's uh what's the upside  here if you're looking at jank to new  york the upside is that this guy can be
KNl9UJkeEHM,11248479,11253600,a filthy athlete and is a filthy athlete  look at the arms here they're barely  touching basically touching his knees
KNl9UJkeEHM,11253600,11260880,right so he grows up in france he goes  to play in the nbl for the new zealand  breakers the nbl in australia one of the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11260880,11266640,top international leagues in the world  has a unique blend of size ball handling
KNl9UJkeEHM,11266640,11273439,can become a good defender over time if  the game just slows down to him for a  certain degree also showed good vision
KNl9UJkeEHM,11273439,11278880,as a passer looks smooth getting to his  shots he just needs to be more  consistent with knocking them down
KNl9UJkeEHM,11278880,11283920,that's the big problem and the big  sticking point with oozman zhang seven
KNl9UJkeEHM,11283920,11290880,points per game for the new zealand  breakers he shot 21 percent from three  on 61 three-point attempts his best
KNl9UJkeEHM,11290880,11298160,skill is ball handling so when you  combine that with the fact that this  dude is 6 10 long 200 pounds you watch
KNl9UJkeEHM,11298160,11303600,him  he certainly has special ability but  again it really does come down to him
KNl9UJkeEHM,11303600,11310160,just going brick city those australian  rims they were taking a beating when he  was trying to hit some houses you look
KNl9UJkeEHM,11310160,11316080,at him play and sometimes he hits these  step backs and with that high release  and with that brandon ingram type of
KNl9UJkeEHM,11316080,11321439,frame this is a pure projection for the  new york knicks that's really what it is
KNl9UJkeEHM,11321439,11326800,you're betting on the upside here but  this guy is a boomer bus prospect  there's no question about it are the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11326800,11331840,knicks a playoff team in 2022 type y for  yes type in for no two years ago they
KNl9UJkeEHM,11331840,11337680,were the four seed oh they're trading  it's okc oh the knicks are trading the  pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,11337680,11344640,let marshall know he might be mid video  why  why for yes in for no
KNl9UJkeEHM,11344640,11350560,so uzman jang gonna go to oklahoma's  perfect oklahoma city player so perfect
KNl9UJkeEHM,11350560,11356640,okay so nick's gonna be on the clock  here at 12 we'll find out momentarily  and they can get their guy in durham or
KNl9UJkeEHM,11356640,11364720,griffin potentially first trade of the  night first trade of the night  so  we'll get that uh those trade details uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,11364720,11370800,to you as soon as we have them uh but uh  uzmangjang gonna go from new york to
KNl9UJkeEHM,11370800,11376239,oklahoma city who was actually up next  at pick number 12. we'll see what these
KNl9UJkeEHM,11376239,11383520,trade details are and uh poor oozman  jinx gonna have to wear the knicks hat  because uh that's how the nba operates
KNl9UJkeEHM,11383520,11388640,uh but how about this multiple  first-round picks to new york for oozman
KNl9UJkeEHM,11388640,11394800,zhang multiple first-round picks chase  uh that's pretty interesting here maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,11394800,11400000,12 in  a future first for zhang maybe that
KNl9UJkeEHM,11400000,11407120,could be the moon okc must have really  wanted him wow  okay  so uzman jang gonna go
KNl9UJkeEHM,11407120,11413200,to the oklahoma city thunder we're still  waiting for details here but uh the  nick's going to get multiple first we
KNl9UJkeEHM,11413200,11418239,don't have the exact picks uh quite yet  but oklahoma city we talked about this
KNl9UJkeEHM,11418239,11425840,earlier chase they've got a lot of  ammunition in terms of first round picks  over the next five or six years here
KNl9UJkeEHM,11425840,11432000,so  we'll see  what the exact picks were we do know  it's multiple first-round picks you
KNl9UJkeEHM,11432000,11437120,would think that means the knicks are  going to be on the clock here at 12 but
KNl9UJkeEHM,11437120,11444000,we do not know exactly yet so  let's talk about  the best available now then
KNl9UJkeEHM,11444000,11449040,as  jang is off the board chase aj griffin
KNl9UJkeEHM,11449040,11454080,jaylen duran a player who's been  connected to new york do they select him
KNl9UJkeEHM,11454080,11459439,now if they are indeed on the clock here  at 12 which we assume is the case uh but
KNl9UJkeEHM,11459439,11465520,uh we don't know for sure yet yeah look  what were we just talking about with the  knicks it was going to be one of the two
KNl9UJkeEHM,11465520,11471279,aj griffin jaylen durham now they went  with jang but that's because oklahoma  city traded up to take him that's the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11471279,11477920,guy who they wanted and by the way  perfect developmental project for okc  that organization has just done a great
KNl9UJkeEHM,11477920,11483760,job of developing players jang might be  the next chad homegroup needs some  developing as well the weight training
KNl9UJkeEHM,11483760,11490239,program going to be important for him  but the focus here the new york knicks i  think it's going to be griffin i think  it's going to be durham and i think the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11490239,11496160,knicks had in mind look we can move back  get future picks from okc is they have a
KNl9UJkeEHM,11496160,11501439,bevy of them and we can still get our  guy and that is a smart move by the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11501439,11508319,knicks if the board was following their  favor and they're getting future draft  capital back with that they didn't want
KNl9UJkeEHM,11508319,11513920,zhang i think they want durham or aj  griffin and they're going to be able to  get him there with an additional first
KNl9UJkeEHM,11513920,11520000,maybe they take another swing at ivy and  they're like hey detroit we have an  extra first now yeah who knows hey we
KNl9UJkeEHM,11520000,11524760,still have that shot yeah we gotta take  here cheers

KNl9UJkeEHM,11531840,11538160,again we're waiting to see technically  who's on the clock here we think it's  probably new york but that is not

KNl9UJkeEHM,11637279,11643760,part of the trade okc gets uzmangjang at  11. now jalen williams a fast riser
KNl9UJkeEHM,11643760,11649840,chase i didn't know he'd go this high  but the santa clara product was rising  up draft boards in recent weeks harrison
KNl9UJkeEHM,11649840,11656160,i sent you a clip last night as i was  doing some last second evaluations of  jalen williams putting chet holmgren on
KNl9UJkeEHM,11656160,11663120,the floor  with a nice little crossover dribble  take to the rack this guy's a really  good player now he played at santa clara
KNl9UJkeEHM,11663120,11668399,last year so a lot of people don't  understand how good of a player he is  and a lot of people haven't heard of
KNl9UJkeEHM,11668399,11673600,them but this can be an elite level  two-way wing and a classic modern day
KNl9UJkeEHM,11673600,11680399,three and d guy just starting to blossom  his numbers with santa clara last year  were great a comfortable and confident
KNl9UJkeEHM,11680399,11687680,shooter from multiple situations beyond  the arc doesn't possess a ton of burst  off the dribble but at the nba level as
KNl9UJkeEHM,11687680,11693680,a three and d guy who i think can be a  better version of robert covington he  doesn't really need to put the ball on
KNl9UJkeEHM,11693680,11700239,the deck or beat you with that first  step off the dribble but he can handle a  little bit better than robert covington
KNl9UJkeEHM,11700239,11706319,18 points per game last year hovered  around 40 percent from three for okc you
KNl9UJkeEHM,11706319,11713600,get chet holmgren who  needs some work in terms of his  physicality and his size but his
KNl9UJkeEHM,11713600,11718960,all-around game is so intriguing you go  oozman jeng as a developmental project
KNl9UJkeEHM,11718960,11727040,and jalen williams at 21 years old he  can play right away and i think he  factors nicely into this okc rotation
KNl9UJkeEHM,11727040,11732399,not sure it's going to be a starter  right away but okc is building something  really special as is another team not
KNl9UJkeEHM,11732399,11738080,far away in the houston russians a  common theme with what the thunder's  doing tonight chase length wingspan for
KNl9UJkeEHM,11738080,11744319,chat homegrown 7-6 oozman zhang 7-1  jalen williams is a good athlete and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,11744319,11751520,two-way type of player as well they're  getting guys they're just throwing darts  right sam presti has all these picks at
KNl9UJkeEHM,11751520,11757520,his disposal and if you hit on a none of  them on enough of them you're gonna have  an eight nine ten eleven twelve man
KNl9UJkeEHM,11757520,11764399,rotation uh in a couple of years so  we'll see uh how this thing plays out  for oklahoma city and you know how okc
KNl9UJkeEHM,11764399,11770160,likes to  take chances and take swings with  players they also are looking at the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11770160,11775200,modern nba landscape they know that they  need length they have it now holmgren's
KNl9UJkeEHM,11775200,11782640,wingspan 7-6 jang 7-1 jaylen williams  7-2 yep they are going to be a menace
KNl9UJkeEHM,11782640,11788319,defensively yeah and they already have  some decent defensive pieces yes they do  to work with as well so those are the
KNl9UJkeEHM,11788319,11793520,last four picks here jeremy sohan to san  antonio johnny davis to washington uzman
KNl9UJkeEHM,11793520,11800000,zhang the first trade of the night chase  goes from the knicks to okc there at 11  and then jalen williams at 12. we're
KNl9UJkeEHM,11800000,11806319,still waiting to trade details chase i  tend to think one of the two multiple  first round picks from okc to the knicks
KNl9UJkeEHM,11806319,11811359,is probably a future pick uh and then  maybe uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,11811359,11818479,another pick tonight so we'll have to  wait and see for now these are the  upcoming picks uh charlotte's got a
KNl9UJkeEHM,11818479,11826000,couple coming up here at 13 and 15.  they're on the clock right now we'll get  to them in a second i know mike dibbles  interested cleveland at 14 hawks 16.
KNl9UJkeEHM,11826000,11833040,let's talk about charlotte here we  thought maybe they would move up with  those two top 15 picks they have not but
KNl9UJkeEHM,11833040,11838239,now they have two of the next three  selections i had said earlier ideally if  the board fell their way they go jeremy
KNl9UJkeEHM,11838239,11843840,sohan and mark williams  so hand gone mark williams is still  there they need to beef up that front
KNl9UJkeEHM,11843840,11849840,court they need to get better and i'd  like to see a rim running big play  alongside lamella ball now jalen duran
KNl9UJkeEHM,11849840,11856560,is still on the board so he could be a  player that charlotte looks to target  here what's interesting johnny davis is
KNl9UJkeEHM,11856560,11863760,still available no johnny  or sorry  aj griffin excuse me still available who
KNl9UJkeEHM,11863760,11869920,like johnny davis is what i meant to say  is also a very very high level score
KNl9UJkeEHM,11869920,11876800,and  you have to balance that do you want to  fulfill the need do you want to go after  a score and give lonzo a lamella ball a
KNl9UJkeEHM,11876800,11882160,really good player at that wing spot who  can be a good spot up shooter and that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,11882160,11888800,what lamelo ball can help him with is  find him with that elite passing ability  no doubt about it pj washington hasn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,11888800,11894880,proven to be that guy in that front  court consistently enough so uh we'll  see if they try to upgrade there some
KNl9UJkeEHM,11894880,11902000,other players available osha obaji out  of kansas tai tai washington junior out  of kentucky still hanging out as well so
KNl9UJkeEHM,11902000,11907279,we're kind of entering that part of the  draft chase where could see more  curveballs here maybe some trades start
KNl9UJkeEHM,11907279,11914160,to happen as well we just had one a  couple of picks to go so uh you know  keep stay with us hang out out we still

KNl9UJkeEHM,12038319,12044640,that just momentarily  two thousand three hundred and seventy
KNl9UJkeEHM,12044640,12051600,six comments in the last minute  that's really appreciate it that's a  record tonight there's no doubt dillon
KNl9UJkeEHM,12051600,12057840,thoughts on tori eason chase  tori eason really long player from lsu
KNl9UJkeEHM,12057840,12065120,who does have some nice scoring ability  uh tara eason you watch him play and  he's just an absolute freak athlete and
KNl9UJkeEHM,12065120,12070560,there are some good players on that lsu  roster that may have  to overshadowed
KNl9UJkeEHM,12070560,12075840,him to a certain degree but he has a dog  mentality and is not afraid to put his
KNl9UJkeEHM,12075840,12082000,nose in opposing offensive players tough  defender with the frame and speed that  teams will crave and that will allow him
KNl9UJkeEHM,12082000,12088560,to be maybe like a herb jones type of  defender year one impressive in the open  floor a human highlight reel when
KNl9UJkeEHM,12088560,12094319,throwing down some dunks especially  finishing around the rim needs time to  fine-tune his offensive game but i don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,12094319,12100560,think the stroke is broken so he's not  gonna be a three and d guy but a jeremy  grant type of player is what i'm looking
KNl9UJkeEHM,12100560,12106160,at for tara houston all right i mean  that's that's pretty good value if you  get him you know 15 to 20 somewhere in
KNl9UJkeEHM,12106160,12111840,there all right uh looks like the next  pick is in it is jalen
KNl9UJkeEHM,12111840,12117120,out of memphis uh chase so he goes to  charlotte here number 13 overall we
KNl9UJkeEHM,12117120,12123680,talked about this you get a a big with  lamella ball durham still on the board  at 13. feels like pretty good value and
KNl9UJkeEHM,12123680,12129040,he reminds me a lot of robert williams  or deandre jordan when he was playing in
KNl9UJkeEHM,12129040,12134800,his prime and let's not get it twisted i  understand that jalen duran doesn't  shoot threes
KNl9UJkeEHM,12134800,12140960,and  isn't that modern day big to stretch the  floor but if you watch how robert  williams and how well he played for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,12140960,12148080,boston celtics throughout the playoffs  he was a game changer at much less than  100 percent so for durham explosive shot
KNl9UJkeEHM,12148080,12156080,blocker really elite leaper like robert  williams because of that i think he can  find a role right away as a rotational
KNl9UJkeEHM,12156080,12161359,big and maybe a spot starter if you need  him to  he's the youngest player who is going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,12161359,12166800,get drafted he's only 18 years old in  six months and that's really impressive
KNl9UJkeEHM,12166800,12172479,the upside is there the potential is  there everybody was talking about some  of the other prospects on memphis and
KNl9UJkeEHM,12172479,12178560,they weren't talking enough about jalen  dern who has elite upside as a shot  blocker unafraid to get physical seven
KNl9UJkeEHM,12178560,12184720,foot five wingspan as well looks like  it's going to be a trade jalen duran's
KNl9UJkeEHM,12184720,12189760,going to head to detroit  that's what's going to happen  interesting so
KNl9UJkeEHM,12189760,12196080,they're going to ship him off to detroit  which is interesting chase because  earlier when we were talking about the
KNl9UJkeEHM,12196080,12203358,knicks pursuit of j uh of jaden ivy i  said well maybe the knicks
KNl9UJkeEHM,12203600,12210000,hold on conflicting reports  shoms now says jaylen durrant to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,12210000,12219040,knicks  okay so buckle up woj and chums  battling one another on their reports so

KNl9UJkeEHM,12244800,12252640,sounds like  but that's what he said what he said  yeah  so shams is doubling down

KNl9UJkeEHM,12297279,12304160,say  three-team trade  potentially

KNl9UJkeEHM,12362160,12370479,already know who the next pick is before  this trade is finalized we'll get back  to this trade osha obagi comes off the
KNl9UJkeEHM,12370479,12377279,board and chase i gotta say  for cleveland a team that was on the  verge of making the playoffs last year i
KNl9UJkeEHM,12377279,12382319,like this pick as a win now player for  the cavaliers i really like it i think i
KNl9UJkeEHM,12382319,12388479,had him going to cleveland in my final  mock because of the fact that he's a win  now player now he's a little bit older
KNl9UJkeEHM,12388479,12394080,and because of that i think people are  going to overthink it what i wanted to  see from abashi going back to kansas one
KNl9UJkeEHM,12394080,12400560,they won a national championship so it  worked out too he needed to improve his  game and he improved his game two-fold
KNl9UJkeEHM,12400560,12407439,in the semifinal against villanova he  lit the world on fire was unconscious  from three he can be a really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,12407439,12413520,three-point shooter a guy who can defend  a couple of different positions and i  don't care about his age at all he's 22
KNl9UJkeEHM,12413520,12420160,years old he was a senior but if you  have him for the next seven to ten years  then who the hell cares if he's 18 or
KNl9UJkeEHM,12420160,12425200,22. this guy is still young he shot  nearly 41 from three-point range last
KNl9UJkeEHM,12425200,12431920,year 19 points per game for the  defending national champion kansas  jayhawks and for cleveland you now have
KNl9UJkeEHM,12431920,12440399,a couple of really intriguing pieces in  darius garland jarrett allen evan mobley  ochai obagi love it kemba walker traded

KNl9UJkeEHM,12695920,12702160,because charlotte has made their  selection and the pick is in at number  15.
KNl9UJkeEHM,12704640,12710399,so remember sam that we got to go back  to the liddy cam  for two roulette wheel spins because
KNl9UJkeEHM,12710399,12717920,another 10 super chat also came in  as for the pick for the charlotte  hornets i love it uh because the hornets
KNl9UJkeEHM,12717920,12723840,needed a big  they needed to fulfill that monster need  on this roster because they're bereft of
KNl9UJkeEHM,12723840,12729920,really good big men now in this draft  class it was really between mark  williams and jalen duren as being the
KNl9UJkeEHM,12729920,12736399,two best  strict centers in this draft class and  for williams he's a really good rim
KNl9UJkeEHM,12736399,12743120,protector an excellent shot blocker who  defends with really good technique in  the post and has a nice strong lower
KNl9UJkeEHM,12743120,12749279,frame where he doesn't get back down all  that much capable ball handler to a  certain degree at the high post that'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,12749279,12755600,be really utilized with dribble handoffs  lack of lateral quickness will lead to  some mismatch problems but you look at
KNl9UJkeEHM,12755600,12760640,the numbers here 11 points per game last  year for mark williams with that duke
KNl9UJkeEHM,12760640,12768000,team that i think we're gonna look back  on in many years and say how did they  not win a national championship there's  no way unc should have beaten duke
KNl9UJkeEHM,12768000,12773840,because duke has like five guys who are  gonna get drafted maybe four in the  first round a couple of them already off
KNl9UJkeEHM,12773840,12781040,the board 11 points per game last year  seven and a half rebounds nearly three  blocks he is not a modern big
KNl9UJkeEHM,12781040,12788720,who's going to stretch the floor but he  is a big who can protect the rim and rim  run with lamello ball as we talked about
KNl9UJkeEHM,12788720,12794720,a little bit earlier we're not sure who  the head coach is going to be if it was  kenny atkinson i'd expect a faster pace
KNl9UJkeEHM,12794720,12801200,do they pivot to mike d'antoni because  he'd be an ideal fit next to lamello  ball if they want to run that style of
KNl9UJkeEHM,12801200,12807200,offense and if that's the case mark  williams can be  that lob threat and that
KNl9UJkeEHM,12807200,12814319,big who can come off those screens and  throw down some alley-oops but either  way i do like uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,12814319,12820880,the hornet selection of mark williams  here at number 15.  also it looks as though the hulk
KNl9UJkeEHM,12820880,12826239,selection is going to be  made and it's going to be aj griffin so
KNl9UJkeEHM,12826239,12832800,back-to-back dookies in this draft class  going at the 15th and 16th picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,12832800,12839600,for aj griffin one of the best scoring  wings in this draft class you watch him  play and offensively he's like jimmy
KNl9UJkeEHM,12839600,12845840,butler with the three ball has this wide  base to his three-point shot which looks  a little bit weird but still knocked
KNl9UJkeEHM,12845840,12852000,down about 48  of his three-point shots he is the son  of raptors assistant and nba veteran
KNl9UJkeEHM,12852000,12858319,adrian griffin creative shot creator he  could put the ball on the floor get to  the rack but also be a spot up shooter
KNl9UJkeEHM,12858319,12865120,might be the best one in that regard in  this draft class has defensive potential  but the tape is terrible he has been a
KNl9UJkeEHM,12865120,12870640,traffic cone defensively and i'm not  sure if that's because of effort it  seemed as though the basketball
KNl9UJkeEHM,12870640,12875760,defensive iq isn't necessarily there  because sometimes you just look lost on
KNl9UJkeEHM,12875760,12881279,the defensive end of the floor so that  is certainly a concern so too is the  fact that
KNl9UJkeEHM,12881279,12887680,in high school he missed two years  because of knee and ankle injury issues  so i'm sure there were some medical red
KNl9UJkeEHM,12887680,12894720,flags i had him going number 11 to the  knicks he falls to number 16. for  atlanta if he stays healthy pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,12894720,12901680,value so you look at the last four picks  here jalen duran number 13 the big out  of memphis going to detroit obviously
KNl9UJkeEHM,12901680,12908319,that was involved in a trade they ended  up getting during the knicks did dump  kemba walker and his salary to try to
KNl9UJkeEHM,12908319,12914640,free up money for jalen brunson ochiai  of baji going to the cavs at number 14 a
KNl9UJkeEHM,12914640,12920640,win now player that fits a win now  roster hornets needed a big they get it  and mark williams and then aj griffin
KNl9UJkeEHM,12920640,12927279,the scoring wing going to the atlanta  hawks we have some super chats to catch  up on once more and then we'll get to a
KNl9UJkeEHM,12927279,12934160,couple of roulette wheel spins at least  two right now we love marshall leon rose  you sleep chump that coming from

KNl9UJkeEHM,13138880,13150720,two  three  four five six  seven eight nine ten eleven 12 13 14 15
KNl9UJkeEHM,13150720,13156000,16 17. come on age 19 20. he did it what
KNl9UJkeEHM,13156000,13164000,are you doing chums what are you doing  [Applause]  grade the chug from brett abc deer f has
KNl9UJkeEHM,13164000,13169760,to be an a  no spillage at all  very good timing on it as well
KNl9UJkeEHM,13169760,13176560,get your red pen out abc deer f very  impressive i'm going down with the eight  town down
KNl9UJkeEHM,13176560,13182720,getting you caught up on everything  that's transpired it has been a crazy  draft and so far we are approaching
KNl9UJkeEHM,13182720,13188319,nearly a half million people who have  tuned in and joined us all throughout  the night
KNl9UJkeEHM,13188319,13195359,rockets are on the clock right now and  what they did  i love because the board fell in their  favor they kind of got shafted to a
KNl9UJkeEHM,13195359,13201040,certain degree in the nba draft lottery  they had the  favorite odds to land the number one
KNl9UJkeEHM,13201040,13207040,overall pick they fall to three and in  doing so they seem to be content with  taking the best player available among
KNl9UJkeEHM,13207040,13212560,jabari smith paolo bencaro and chet  holmgren in my opinion  they got the number one player in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,13212560,13217600,draft class and jabari smith an elite  level wing who is so long and so lengthy
KNl9UJkeEHM,13217600,13224640,so athletic and so explosive and because  of that i think he's going to be a  two-way threat i love the  competitiveness that he carries himself
KNl9UJkeEHM,13224640,13230319,with never backs down from a challenge i  thought what bruce pearl said yesterday  was really interesting he compared him
KNl9UJkeEHM,13230319,13235680,to kevin durant because 610 611 with  that high release point that nobody can
KNl9UJkeEHM,13235680,13241120,really guard when you combine it with  the athleticism so that's the player  that the rockets are getting back
KNl9UJkeEHM,13241120,13246800,in jabari smith and  the pick is in at number 17. houston's
KNl9UJkeEHM,13246800,13252720,gonna get some more length it is going  to be tori eason out of lsu he is going
KNl9UJkeEHM,13252720,13258720,to be the selection for h-town and you  look at his profile here from la
KNl9UJkeEHM,13258720,13264239,21 years old 6-8 217 pounds last year  with the tigers
KNl9UJkeEHM,13264239,13270239,17 points per game nearly seven rebounds  52 from the floor and our scouting
KNl9UJkeEHM,13270239,13277279,report for him really tough defender who  can guard multiple positions there are  so many switches in today's nba so you
KNl9UJkeEHM,13277279,13282319,need guys to have this flexibility  reminds me a little bit of jeremy grant
KNl9UJkeEHM,13282319,13288800,has the frame and speed that teams will  crave and i think that's why the rockets  selected him impressive breathtaking and
KNl9UJkeEHM,13288800,13295760,exciting in the open floor throws down  some incredible hammers gonna need some  time to fine-tune his offensive game but
KNl9UJkeEHM,13295760,13302479,in houston he can come in off the bench  and work on that offensive game over  time so the rockets so far they have
KNl9UJkeEHM,13302479,13308479,three first-round picks they already  made two they have one remaining at  round 126
KNl9UJkeEHM,13308479,13315120,in about nine selections but so far  they've gone jabari smith as well as  tori eason and with that i think we're
KNl9UJkeEHM,13315120,13320560,gonna welcome back the h-dog harrison  graham  with  the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13320560,13327600,chicago bulls on the clock at number 18.  what are you thinking for chicago as the  host of bears now yeah a lot of ej
KNl9UJkeEHM,13327600,13334160,ledell and get your shout outs in grade  the rockets picks so far zero to 100 100  man they've crushed it um
KNl9UJkeEHM,13334160,13340960,i would like ej liddell  um i think if i'm chicago i'm trying to  move vuchevich this offseason i'm trying
KNl9UJkeEHM,13340960,13347760,to get that salary off my books and get  some flexibility maybe go after rudy  gobert i think they're the one team that
KNl9UJkeEHM,13347760,13353760,makes sense for him they need a  defensive anchor and they don't have  that um i think vooge fits what they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,13353760,13360479,trying to do so i would look to doing  that but as far as with this pick i i  like liddell i think it would be a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,13360479,13367199,selection here at number 18. i do too  and this is the byproduct of liddell
KNl9UJkeEHM,13367199,13373920,thinking about two years ago  going to the nba draft instead he comes  back to ohio state in this game really
KNl9UJkeEHM,13373920,13379840,did take tremendous jumps for his size  he's a little bit undersized at that  forward spot really good shot blocker
KNl9UJkeEHM,13379840,13386160,knocks down the three i think he's a  more athletic grant williams type of  player who i think is going to be able
KNl9UJkeEHM,13386160,13391840,to come in and play a lot as a rookie  and be a very very quality player right
KNl9UJkeEHM,13391840,13398080,from the jump let's get caught up on  some super chats here toxic tom downey  burner account two bones so what do my
KNl9UJkeEHM,13398080,13404640,cavs do with karis levert love the pick  might be able to hold on to him i think  levert really good benchmark
KNl9UJkeEHM,13404640,13411760,if he fits into that role starter from  time to time you go obagi who's a little  bit younger doesn't necessarily have the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13411760,13418080,injury concerns and health concerns that  levert has had over time i like lavert  if he can be your tim hardaway junior
KNl9UJkeEHM,13418080,13423600,off the bench he could be a very good  scorer for your second year yeah i don't  like drafting a baji means you have to
KNl9UJkeEHM,13423600,13430160,move levert like you can't have enough  wings twos threes uh you can stack up  load up on those and you know we don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,13430160,13435600,know if obagi is going to be a starter  as a rookie or not so i'm keeping levert  for now the real question is is colin
KNl9UJkeEHM,13435600,13441520,sexton going to be back are they going  to go resign him i think that is the big  decision for cleveland moving forward
KNl9UJkeEHM,13441520,13448960,with nba free agency set to kick off  next week so uh chicago bulls on the  clock here at 18. so
KNl9UJkeEHM,13448960,13455600,it's loose details of the knicks trade  from earlier uh chase multiple firsts to
KNl9UJkeEHM,13455600,13461279,new york for jalen duran and kemba  walker going to uh that's not the  pistons logo by the way but uh the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13461279,13467279,pistons getting uh jalen duran and  kimball walker but still a lot to figure  out basically the knicks are trying to
KNl9UJkeEHM,13467279,13474399,clear cap space yes they can make a run  at jalen brunson or dare i say kyrie  irving basically yeah kyrie jaylen
KNl9UJkeEHM,13474399,13480640,brunson kevin durant who knows man okc  gets 11. detroit gets durian and kemba
KNl9UJkeEHM,13480640,13486479,walker just to free up some money if  you're the knicks charlotte gets a 20 25
KNl9UJkeEHM,13486479,13493040,first  four second round picks and knicks get  multiple first as we talked about  speaking of the knicks how about this

KNl9UJkeEHM,13539199,13544239,ivy  they could be in a fun team to watch  moving forward in the next couple of
KNl9UJkeEHM,13544239,13549520,years here fantastic and for the pistons  teams like the rockets
KNl9UJkeEHM,13549520,13555600,the future did not look bright let's put  the orlando magic in there as well but  this is why i've continued to say
KNl9UJkeEHM,13555600,13561359,i think that the nba top to bottom is as  talented and deep as ever the pistons
KNl9UJkeEHM,13561359,13568160,magic and rockets next year they're not  going to make the playoffs they're going  to be bad teams but you know what when  those teams come to town they're going
KNl9UJkeEHM,13568160,13575680,to be really playing when you  have nba league pass or you're watching  on nationally televised games or even  locally on some regional sports networks
KNl9UJkeEHM,13575680,13581600,my goodness i mean you get to see some  star power come to town for the pistons  a team like that with that young core
KNl9UJkeEHM,13581600,13587600,the nba is in a really good spot if  you're just a true hoop head the pistons  are going to be a team that wins like 30
KNl9UJkeEHM,13587600,13593840,games next year  but they're going to like steal one from  golden state here and there  you know what i mean like they're going
KNl9UJkeEHM,13593840,13599680,to sneak up on people like teams are  going to load manage against them and  they're going to beat them because of  that because they've got some
KNl9UJkeEHM,13599680,13606080,young exciting fun players so keep that  in mind going forward here here's the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13606080,13612319,trade we were talking about multiple  first for jalen dern kimball walker i  think there's other moving parts here as
KNl9UJkeEHM,13612319,13618479,we progress forward so we'll see  marshall green's going to try to break  all that down chase over on new york
KNl9UJkeEHM,13618479,13625279,knicks now we'll see how he handles that  as expected by the way  kemba and detroit gonna negotiate a
KNl9UJkeEHM,13625279,13630399,buyout  yeah which is interesting you know he  still he had a couple games before he
KNl9UJkeEHM,13630399,13636319,sat out the rest of the year last year i  didn't have like a 35 point game he  played well when he had some rest but
KNl9UJkeEHM,13636319,13643760,the problem is he's not a high level  player for a majority in the bulk of the  season i think for a contender to be a
KNl9UJkeEHM,13643760,13650080,backup point guard he could still give  you a little something by the way from  jake fisher bull's number 18 pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,13650080,13655600,has been one of the mid-first-round  selections long considered available for  a trade all right we'll see if uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,13655600,13661600,chicago moves this selection here as  they are on the clock uh but uh the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13661600,13666720,bulls they're in an interesting spot  chase for about two-thirds of the season  last year they were the favorites in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13666720,13673199,east they had the best you know the  number one record through about 50 games  55 games and then after the all-star
KNl9UJkeEHM,13673199,13678800,break they fell apart i think they went  like six and 17 to finish the regular  season it was really brutal but lonzo
KNl9UJkeEHM,13678800,13684319,ball getting hurt hurt them hopefully he  recovers but you know i would assume  last year as a second round pick was a
KNl9UJkeEHM,13684319,13691199,nice selection they've got some good  pieces the problem is they can't guard  they need better defensive players down
KNl9UJkeEHM,13691199,13698080,low and on the perimeter they can score  with anybody with levine derozan and  vooch although i would move vooch
KNl9UJkeEHM,13698080,13704239,but you need more defensive players next  to patrick williams yeah and it looks as  though the bulls pick is in
KNl9UJkeEHM,13704239,13710239,and it looks as though it's going to be  dale and terry who cares about arizona  who can play defense you know what my
KNl9UJkeEHM,13710239,13716960,pro comp for him andre godallah who for  a long time just an elite defender at  that wing spot in the nba and that's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,13716960,13722239,big reason why he won nba finals mvp  back in 2015. for dale and terry the
KNl9UJkeEHM,13722239,13729600,numbers certainly won't scream at you  right eight points per game five  rebounds four assis a steal plus but
KNl9UJkeEHM,13729600,13736160,what do those numbers show you all  around playmaker who can impact the game  in a bevy of ways active and energetic
KNl9UJkeEHM,13736160,13741760,defender it's gonna help him get early  nba minutes because you can put him on  the floor and know that he's not gonna
KNl9UJkeEHM,13741760,13747279,be a sieve and a liability defensively  can handle okay for his size some
KNl9UJkeEHM,13747279,13753600,shooting upside i was watching the  stroke last night i don't think that  it's faulty or broken by any six percent
KNl9UJkeEHM,13753600,13760960,from three thirty six that's not bad  only 77 and three-point attempts though  but a quirky ball handler a tight enough
KNl9UJkeEHM,13760960,13767439,dribble to run a little bit of point so  you also get some positional versatility  here does have a knack for being a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,13767439,13773279,shooter uh when he's open and then a  good passer finding some cutters and  shooters around the three-point arc
KNl9UJkeEHM,13773279,13780080,report coming in the bulls did get a lot  of trade interest but they have opted to  keep this selection so it sounds like
KNl9UJkeEHM,13780080,13789040,dale and terry will remain a chicago  bull as he is the number 18 pick in the  2022 nba draft so
KNl9UJkeEHM,13789040,13794399,bulls select terry as we progress  forward here in our draft coverage still

KNl9UJkeEHM,14087520,14094720,are covering the draft but we have fun  too as you guys send in super chats  appreciate all the support um
KNl9UJkeEHM,14094720,14100880,we owe a couple of roulette wheels after  that 200 we'll get to that in a bit  we'll let everybody calm down uh chase
KNl9UJkeEHM,14100880,14106800,minnesota here we talked a little bit  earlier about d'angelo russell is he a  part of the future i think that's up for
KNl9UJkeEHM,14106800,14112160,debate um oh uh by the way jake laravia  out of wake forest but he's gonna get
KNl9UJkeEHM,14112160,14117199,traded to the memphis grizzlies here as  they add a guy who can help stretch the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14117199,14124640,floor a little bit yeah this is  interesting so you looked at jalen  williams and jake laravia as two of the  draft risers coming into tonight yep a
KNl9UJkeEHM,14124640,14131600,couple of these guys had good showings  at the nba scouting combine good  workouts with some of their respective  teams in the pre-draft process and
KNl9UJkeEHM,14131600,14137920,there's been some buzz behind jalen  williams going top 15. he did jake  laravia sneaking into the first round
KNl9UJkeEHM,14137920,14142960,not only does he sneak into the first  round  he goes 19 overall i compare him kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,14142960,14149920,to kyle anderson i think he can become a  better shooter than him but just his  fingerprints on the game from
KNl9UJkeEHM,14149920,14156399,an overall versatile perspective there's  all the little things to help a team win  passing cutting defending
KNl9UJkeEHM,14156399,14161760,sounds like a player for the memphis  grizzlies has the versatility to defend  multiple positions
KNl9UJkeEHM,14161760,14168560,does lack a consistent jump shot off the  dribble but can be an okay  catch and shoot guy and if he develops
KNl9UJkeEHM,14168560,14174960,that three over time then i think  laravia could really become a very  interesting prospect highly skilled
KNl9UJkeEHM,14174960,14180399,player who has some good size too six  six he's 20 years old 227 pounds so the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14180399,14187120,frame is good 14 and a half points per  game last year to go along with six and  a half boards pretty good passer for
KNl9UJkeEHM,14187120,14192720,that size as well a steal plus nearly  two steals per game 30. the only thing
KNl9UJkeEHM,14192720,14199279,that he lacks is that reliable jump shot  off 38.5 from three somewhat of a small  sample size just over two threes per
KNl9UJkeEHM,14199279,14205120,game but he's capable he's shown he can  do that and  the grizzlies to me and by the way
KNl9UJkeEHM,14205120,14211439,minnesota is going to get picks 22 and  29 interest rates uh wow memphis really  wanted him then yeah that's pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,14211439,14218239,from minnesota you dropped down three  spots plus land the second last pick of  the first round but  i kind of look at memphis chase and i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,14218239,14224640,like this feels like  a team trying to be the next warriors  where they have their superstar guard
KNl9UJkeEHM,14224640,14231680,and i girl a bunch of snipers around him  a lot of ball movement motion offense  they hit play with attitude like golden
KNl9UJkeEHM,14231680,14237920,ravi could be that high post passer like  draymond service for the warriors i kind  of feel like that the season they had
KNl9UJkeEHM,14237920,14243199,this year was kind of like the mark  jackson warriors were like okay they've  arrived can they take that next step
KNl9UJkeEHM,14243199,14248880,right i think that's where memphis is  right now maybe la ravia can be a guy  that can help them uh get over the top a
KNl9UJkeEHM,14248880,14255520,team that won i mean 56 games i mean  they were damn good this year yeah who  won the trade type mem for memphis min
KNl9UJkeEHM,14255520,14262080,for minnesota  i kind of like minnesota here to be  honest i mean they they only move down a  couple slots and they pick up an extra
KNl9UJkeEHM,14262080,14267760,first as well yeah this this tells me  that the grizzlies really wanted it they  really wanted they really really wanted
KNl9UJkeEHM,14267760,14273600,the ravi and i had him going like 25 30  19  he's having a good night if he goes this
KNl9UJkeEHM,14273600,14280479,early yeah no doubt about it get some  shout outs here uh producer sam let me  step aside here in a sec here oh you're
KNl9UJkeEHM,14280479,14286960,gonna hop off here just hop off real  quick a couple of five dollar super  chats that came in all right i'll catch  you guys up on some super chats chase

KNl9UJkeEHM,14311120,14317680,trades out of thin air but i do hear  what you're saying chicago is in a win  now mode there's no doubt about that for
KNl9UJkeEHM,14317680,14323359,now they'll have to settle for dale and  terry travis lee with the five pieces of  grizzlies fans we got fleece what the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14323359,14329199,hell  like chase said travis they clearly like  laravia i mean
KNl9UJkeEHM,14329199,14334800,if they're convicted with this player  go get them uh maybe they got there was
KNl9UJkeEHM,14334800,14340319,chatter that he wasn't going to fall to  22. so they went up they made they got  their guy and if you're the grizzlies
KNl9UJkeEHM,14340319,14348560,you don't need  two first-round picks here you got a lot  of talent with jaw bane dylan brooks uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,14348560,14354960,adams uh you know we'll see what happens  with tyus jones but this has a t deep  roster here we'll see if kyle anderson

KNl9UJkeEHM,14516479,14523680,spurs pick is in uh actually we'll get  to that in a second though ben carroll  won chat home green goes two to okc
KNl9UJkeEHM,14523680,14529359,jabari smith to the rockets at three  kicking murray to the kings at four five  through eight jaden ivy to the pistons
KNl9UJkeEHM,14529359,14536720,benedict mather into the pacers shaden  sharp goes to portland at seven and then  the pelicans select dyson daniels at
KNl9UJkeEHM,14536720,14543600,number eight nine through 12 here jeremy  sohan the forward out of baylor goes to  san antonio johnny davis the wisconsin
KNl9UJkeEHM,14543600,14548880,guard to washington uh the thunder  traded up
KNl9UJkeEHM,14550560,14558080,williams uh ignore that noise in the  background everybody's fine we think uh  13 through 16. jalen duren goes to
KNl9UJkeEHM,14558080,14564160,detroit as a part of a wild trade with  the knicks uh i believe osha obaji uh to
KNl9UJkeEHM,14564160,14571680,cleveland at 14 mark williams 15 to  charlotte aj griffin goes to the hawks  at 16. tari eason out of lsu goes to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14571680,14577520,rockets at 17. dalen terry at 18 goes to  the bulls jake laravey at 19 goes to
KNl9UJkeEHM,14577520,14584880,memphis and then the pick that just came  in malachi branham out of ohio state and  we'll bring back in chase senior and uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,14584880,14590880,chase uh branham here out of ohio state  20 to the spurs do you like it i i like
KNl9UJkeEHM,14590880,14596160,it on top of what they already did and  you look at malachi brand and he's 19
KNl9UJkeEHM,14596160,14602080,years old he's a freshman last year with  ohio state a lot of people didn't expect  him to be a one-and-done player but he
KNl9UJkeEHM,14602080,14609120,blossomed and his scoring talents really  improved throughout the year 13 points  per game knocked down about 43 percent
KNl9UJkeEHM,14609120,14616239,of his three-point shots he's a really  talented ball handler and look he's six  for 195 pounds so when he finishes
KNl9UJkeEHM,14616239,14622479,around the rim he can have some trouble  there but he's a great shooter off the  trouble he can drain some threes
KNl9UJkeEHM,14622479,14629199,can thrive in the mid range as well with  some turnarounds and fadeaways to his  offensive toolbox consistent shooting
KNl9UJkeEHM,14629199,14635840,mechanics the release point can be just  a little bit higher and that's why i  mentioned that size there at 6'4 his
KNl9UJkeEHM,14635840,14643359,shots can get blocked and might get  blocked at the nba level but again for  the spurs last year you got the youngest
KNl9UJkeEHM,14643359,14649040,player in josh primo this year you got  your draymond green ben simmons at the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14649040,14654800,four type and jeremy sohan and then you  get another really young player a one  and done player just like zohan and
KNl9UJkeEHM,14654800,14661520,malachi branham out of ohio state you  have the makings of a nice little  complimentary cast around dejante murray
KNl9UJkeEHM,14661520,14667359,now for san antonio if you don't compete  next year  and throughout the year you're getting
KNl9UJkeEHM,14667359,14673359,some really good offers for dejante  murray maybe you trade them away for  future draft assets and i think the plan
KNl9UJkeEHM,14673359,14679600,for them once greg popovich steps away  they're going to bring in quinn snyder  who could do with the spurs and that
KNl9UJkeEHM,14679600,14687120,young team like he did with the utah  jazz yeah we'll see what happens there i  think that's a big question moving  forward for san antonio is dejante
KNl9UJkeEHM,14687120,14693439,murray a guy you can build around he's  an all-star can he be a superstar i  think that's up for debate denver
KNl9UJkeEHM,14693439,14699279,nuggets on the clock here at 21. mr  stegosaurus with the super chat uh which
KNl9UJkeEHM,14699279,14705680,means another roulette spin because  we're over 700 dollars how many more  moves does detroit make what should they
KNl9UJkeEHM,14705680,14713199,do  uh  what's the updated picks for detroit sam  do we have after all the trading do they
KNl9UJkeEHM,14713199,14718960,have any more picks are they done  tonight i'll take this here so detroit  now i'm not going to get into the pics
KNl9UJkeEHM,14718960,14724560,because i don't know all that but this  is what i know about detroit you now  have a young core
KNl9UJkeEHM,14724560,14731120,of some really intriguing players cade  cunningham last year was fantastic once  he started to improve his shooting
KNl9UJkeEHM,14731120,14736399,stroke you have jaden ivy as his  backcourt mate you have jalen duren and
KNl9UJkeEHM,14736399,14743199,then also some really good players on  the team as well  that i think can turn the pistons into a
KNl9UJkeEHM,14743199,14749600,team that can be very good and can be a  problem in a couple of years i almost  look at like what they're doing right
KNl9UJkeEHM,14749600,14754960,now and i compare it to the memphis  grizzlies you have your superstar in  kade now you're surrounding cade with
KNl9UJkeEHM,14754960,14760560,all those necessary pieces and this is a  detroit team like houston that's been
KNl9UJkeEHM,14760560,14767680,able to get on that fast track with  their rebuilding process i love what  detroit is doing this is impressive
KNl9UJkeEHM,14767680,14773840,yeah i'm with you i like uh the moves  they've made tonight uh and you know  we'll see if uh they can be contending
KNl9UJkeEHM,14773840,14779040,in the next couple of years as they  continue to build uh pick is in and uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,14779040,14785920,maybe a tick early i actually like this  player though chase christian brown out  of kansas is gonna go 21 maybe it's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,14785920,14791840,tick early but a team like denver chase  who's trying to win right now  christian brown to me is one of the more
KNl9UJkeEHM,14791840,14797920,win-now players in this strap that  wasn't going to go in the lottery good  athlete good three-point shooter winning
KNl9UJkeEHM,14797920,14803439,background playing at the university of  kansas  uh just winning a national championship  i like christian brown he's got
KNl9UJkeEHM,14803439,14810720,defensive versatility and he can uh play  multiple positions on both ends of the  floor he goes 21st overall to the denver
KNl9UJkeEHM,14810720,14817040,nuggets here it really confused me when  i was looking at some of the mocks and  they had them not going in the first  round i'm like what are y'all thinking
KNl9UJkeEHM,14817040,14824000,now i had him going with the final pick  in my mock draft  this guy  i love his spirit in which he plays with
KNl9UJkeEHM,14824000,14832640,a lot of energy a lot of passion he's  not afraid to let a scream out after a  big play and i love that about him 67209
KNl9UJkeEHM,14832640,14839040,exceptional athlete 14 points per game  last year pretty good three-point  shooter he was just shy of that 40
KNl9UJkeEHM,14839040,14846479,percent mark right now he has that  corner three down if he extends that out  to the arc straight away this guy can
KNl9UJkeEHM,14846479,14852399,become a problem and i think it's  disrespectful to say that he can only be  a three and d player i think that he can
KNl9UJkeEHM,14852399,14858399,be a wing who can also put the ball on  the floor and not just be a spot up  shooter he's so pesky guarded multiple
KNl9UJkeEHM,14858399,14864319,positions last year definitely struggled  to be a go-to score like kansas had  asked them to be it's not his role at
KNl9UJkeEHM,14864319,14870479,the nba level i think this is a classic  example of a guy who might be able to be  a better pro player
KNl9UJkeEHM,14870479,14877120,than he was college player because with  kansas he was asked to do a little bit  more  great the pick abcdrf maybe it's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,14877120,14882640,ticker early but i think for a team like  denver again chase i think  fit matters and they're trying to win
KNl9UJkeEHM,14882640,14890239,now and brown is a guy that can play nba  minutes right away so i'll go like bb  plus here uh i don't mind going a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,14890239,14896399,early here i think he's a guy who can  give you 15 20 minutes a game as a  rookie uh so i'll give this a solid b
KNl9UJkeEHM,14896399,14901920,for denver here in this uh in the 21st  pick yeah i'm about that um for denver i
KNl9UJkeEHM,14901920,14907840,think it's a solid b b minus do want to  give you our super chat menu here right
KNl9UJkeEHM,14907840,14913680,now seven hundred dollars in super chats  we gonna be able to get through a  thousand really quickly mike dibble 300

KNl9UJkeEHM,14936479,14942560,yeah we're less than 300 away there's by  the way there's controversy in the  office uh some say we've spun the
KNl9UJkeEHM,14942560,14948479,roulette wheel for 700. i'm not sure  that we have we did not because we have  seven i don't know if mitch and the boys
KNl9UJkeEHM,14948479,14954479,are trying to avoid a sp a roulette spin  here but uh i think we owe one so we'll  try to not spin it for a second try and
KNl9UJkeEHM,14954479,14960960,get that straightened out here as uh the  t wolves are on the clock once again  here after they traded back with memphis
KNl9UJkeEHM,14960960,14967359,chase by the way i should add  memphis is also getting a future second  in that trade so that adds a little more
KNl9UJkeEHM,14967359,14973600,context yeah i would still lean  minnesota in that trade on paper in  terms of who won the trade uh but uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,14973600,14978720,tyler jones i actually thought he left  uh he's been hiding somewhere
KNl9UJkeEHM,14978720,14984319,teacher uh we're going live to liddy cam  whenever he's ready
KNl9UJkeEHM,14985040,14991279,the voice is real hello america  the philippines

KNl9UJkeEHM,15025680,15033040,imitating  we don't know we have to decide  dolphins fans

KNl9UJkeEHM,15050319,15056720,that was pretty good that was pretty  good i must say  all right chase you look at uh the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,15056720,15063520,available ty ty washington nikola yovich  uh who uh we might do a little cut for
KNl9UJkeEHM,15063520,15068960,uh  ej liddell still hanging out kennedy  chandler a notable name still on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15068960,15076080,board as we get to the latter third of  the first round uh who do you like for  minnesota here at 22. we have a couple
KNl9UJkeEHM,15076080,15081760,of options ty ty washington can be  not your d'angelo russell replacement
KNl9UJkeEHM,15081760,15088080,but he can help fill that void if you do  trade him away  i wouldn't hate going wing here or maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,15088080,15094398,like a backup forward that's kind of  what i'm looking at for minnesota about  walker kessler
KNl9UJkeEHM,15095600,15102080,a thing in a lot of mocks and a lot of  pre-draft speculation  need a backup center defensive player of
KNl9UJkeEHM,15102080,15109680,the year last year at auburn doesn't  really do much else beside finish around  the rim and block shots but walker
KNl9UJkeEHM,15109680,15117760,kessler i actually kind of like the fit  as a backup big behind carl anthony  towns 7-1 256 pounds 11 points per game
KNl9UJkeEHM,15117760,15123199,last year eight rebounds a  four and a half blocks per game this guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,15123199,15130239,is a special defensive run protector and  hey i think fit was going to be key with  kessler and towns as their starting five
KNl9UJkeEHM,15130239,15135680,hey give me 15 good defensive minutes  off the bench yeah i mean that's that's  what you're looking at here right so you
KNl9UJkeEHM,15135680,15141520,get him uh to back up carl anthony towns  who's not a good defensive player so
KNl9UJkeEHM,15141520,15147359,maybe if you're a minnesota chase you  know you're getting crunch time in some  of these key games you go a little  offense for defense
KNl9UJkeEHM,15147359,15153920,when you're when you're substituting so  i think the fit makes sense and uh i  like this pick for minnesota
KNl9UJkeEHM,15153920,15161040,specifically i don't think he would have  made sense for a lot of teams but i  think he makes sense for the  timberwolves and look last year 47
KNl9UJkeEHM,15161040,15167359,three-point attempts so it's not like he  was totally unwilling to shoot the three  ball now he connected on 21 of them
KNl9UJkeEHM,15167359,15173199,which is a little bit of a problem but  245 pounds seven foot five wingspan him
KNl9UJkeEHM,15173199,15178239,blocking nearly five  shots  that's outrageous he swatted everything
KNl9UJkeEHM,15178239,15184479,in his sight right around the rim and  he's a pretty good rim protector what's  also of note here he was able to avoid
KNl9UJkeEHM,15184479,15189840,fouls too so that tells me that he was  pretty smart with how he went about
KNl9UJkeEHM,15189840,15196640,swatting some shots around the rim  primarily a drop defender in the pick  and roll has shown some agility but i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,15196640,15204159,interested to see whether it's in the  summer league or by the time the regular  season comes around  if if he gets put in the pick and roll
KNl9UJkeEHM,15204159,15209520,how he responds to that shot blocker off  ball defense interior scoring and hustle
KNl9UJkeEHM,15209520,15215760,those are really the calling cards for  walker kessler so the philadelphia 76ers  are on the clock but they're trading the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15215760,15222319,pick yeah um so we'll see you we're  gonna hop off we'll see what you're  gonna number number 23 overall for
KNl9UJkeEHM,15222319,15228560,d'anthony that's a video  yeah anthony melton the anthony melton  to philadelphia
KNl9UJkeEHM,15228560,15233920,is gonna go from memphis to philadelphia  here so we'll get those trade details
KNl9UJkeEHM,15233920,15240319,here's the deal chase senior is our host  of philadelphia 76ers now and you're  trying to close the gap on celtics today
KNl9UJkeEHM,15240319,15246720,you and will scott got a little  competition going so if you're a sixers  fan go subscribe youtube.com
KNl9UJkeEHM,15246720,15253120,76ers tv if you're a celtics fan go  subscribe youtube.com celticstv whatever
KNl9UJkeEHM,15253120,15259520,fan base uh you're a part of uh go check  out our team channels we have two uh  channels uh for each of these or we have
KNl9UJkeEHM,15259520,15264800,a channel for each of these that's not  right that trade alert right okay okay  all right just making sure yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,15264800,15270560,subscribe to philadelphia 76ers now been  cooking up some really good content over  there and the channel's been popping of
KNl9UJkeEHM,15270560,15276640,late really big offseason for  philadelphia so d'anthony melton to the  sixers this is pretty interesting i mean
KNl9UJkeEHM,15276640,15282080,he's only 23 years old nearly 11 points  per game last year connected on about 37
KNl9UJkeEHM,15282080,15288720,percent of his threes he was a 40  percent fuel goal shooter four and a  half rebounds little less than three
KNl9UJkeEHM,15288720,15297040,dimes stealing a half per game so he  does help you defensively a second round  pick of the houston rockets back in 2018
KNl9UJkeEHM,15297040,15303840,last year he played for the memphis  grizzlies so what daryl mori is trying  to do  bring in some good rotational players
KNl9UJkeEHM,15303840,15310239,some good bench players d'anthony melton  does fit that category so here's the  trade it's uh very simple and chase
KNl9UJkeEHM,15310239,15316159,senior is gonna go uh break this down on  our sixers channel he'll be back  probably in about 20 30 minutes uh maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,15316159,15321840,a little longer he may go break down the  warriors pick here coming up too uh the  anthony melton a bit of a three and d
KNl9UJkeEHM,15321840,15327199,guy it goes from memphis to philadelphia  the grizzlies pick up this selection so
KNl9UJkeEHM,15327199,15334000,they moved up for laravia now they get  this pick back basically so uh they'll  select here in just a moment uh looks
KNl9UJkeEHM,15334000,15340080,like that pick's about to be in here so  we'll break that down in a second but uh  i don't mind this for philadelphia they
KNl9UJkeEHM,15340080,15345199,need more uh shooting the anthony melton  should be able to provide some of that
KNl9UJkeEHM,15345199,15351040,okay david roddy out of colorado state a  sniper from three so memphis selecting a
KNl9UJkeEHM,15351040,15356880,couple of forwards who can space the  floor interesting player 6-6 260
KNl9UJkeEHM,15356880,15362640,israeli out of colorado state 19 points  per game one of the best scorers in  college basketball you rebound at seven
KNl9UJkeEHM,15362640,15368640,and a half boards and the shooting is  what you like  43.8 percent and i compared the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15368640,15375520,grizzlies earlier to what the warriors  wore when they kind of first started  getting their dynasty going uh roddy not
KNl9UJkeEHM,15375520,15381760,the highest ranked prospect but a guy  who can really shoot the ball memphis is  trying to find guys who can space the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15381760,15387279,floor he can defend uh he can play small  ball five or four uh and should have
KNl9UJkeEHM,15387279,15392479,some versatility  if he can slim down a little bit as well  a guy who can certainly still develop
KNl9UJkeEHM,15392479,15398800,his body but it's pretty clear to me  what memphis is trying to do guys that  can come in and shoot the basketball la
KNl9UJkeEHM,15398800,15404159,ravia roddy those are a couple of guys  that should be able to do just that all
KNl9UJkeEHM,15404159,15409199,right who won the trade type nam for  memphis phi for philly that pick turned
KNl9UJkeEHM,15409199,15415600,into uh david roddy out of colorado  state who won this trade let us know in
KNl9UJkeEHM,15415600,15422640,the comment section who was the winner  of this trade we're gonna bring in will  scott here in a moment uh to sub in for

KNl9UJkeEHM,15600640,15606239,as we continue here with our coverage  bucks on the clock here at 24 san
KNl9UJkeEHM,15606239,15612319,antonio will be back at 25 the rocket's  at 26 and then the miami heat over at 27
KNl9UJkeEHM,15612319,15619279,that rockets pick comes from the  christian wood trade 28 through 31 here  31 will start the second round warriors
KNl9UJkeEHM,15619279,15624479,at 28 timber wolves at 29 that just came  from memphis and then the denver nuggets
KNl9UJkeEHM,15624479,15630399,will close out the first round with the  30th overall selection looks like the  pick is in
KNl9UJkeEHM,15630399,15636399,from milwaukee here we'll break that  down in a second uh whenever uh we're
KNl9UJkeEHM,15636399,15643760,ready to go  and uh marjon beauchamp is the pick here  play with the g-league ignite uh number
KNl9UJkeEHM,15643760,15651439,24 overall this was kind of the range we  thought he would go mid late first early  second he sneaks into round one at pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,15651439,15656720,24. good wing player uh who can play off  the ball really good athlete as well can
KNl9UJkeEHM,15656720,15664239,handle the basketball he's got a good  shot but the percentages haven't  translated yet needs to uh improve in
KNl9UJkeEHM,15664239,15670399,that efficiency but he goes 24 number 26  overall on our composite rankings let's
KNl9UJkeEHM,15670399,15675520,bring in will scott here will it's been  a busy night in the nba margin joe
KNl9UJkeEHM,15675520,15681680,beauchamp just goes to milwaukee the  defending champs from a couple of years  ago spurs will be on the clock coming up
KNl9UJkeEHM,15681680,15688640,in a moment yeah he's an interesting  prospect you know had the opportunity to  go college ball and throughout that
KNl9UJkeEHM,15688640,15695359,recruiting process he was weighing his  options ended up playing for four  different high schools in the seattle
KNl9UJkeEHM,15695359,15701359,area he actually uh knows paolo bancaro  very very well in fact there's a lot of
KNl9UJkeEHM,15701359,15707439,rumors that uh you know they kind of  wanted to end up on the same team that's  not going to happen with beauchamp going
KNl9UJkeEHM,15707439,15713040,to milwaukee but he's one of those  g-league guys played for the ignite and  there's certainly a lot of upside just
KNl9UJkeEHM,15713040,15719439,not a whole just not a guy we know a  whole lot about because he did go that g  league round yeah you know it it'll be
KNl9UJkeEHM,15719439,15725120,interesting to see over the next several  years will these guys who go the g  league route does this become this
KNl9UJkeEHM,15725120,15731840,legitimate avenue for guys to play a  year in the g league make 100 000 bucks  or whatever uh and then go to the nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,15731840,15737520,draft i think we're kind of you know  just seeing the early uh you know  results of that but we don't know
KNl9UJkeEHM,15737520,15742720,exactly if that's going to be the best  route or not you guys can grade the pick  for us then we'll talk a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,15742720,15748319,about san antonio who's picking up at  25. uh so grade this pick of beauchamp
KNl9UJkeEHM,15748319,15754000,uh to the bucks at 24. i'll get a few  shout outs here tater says a uh in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15754000,15762319,chat  uh let's see uh central new york 100 in  there uh spurs can't draft anymore uh is
KNl9UJkeEHM,15762319,15769120,there a bulls channel no bulls channel  as of now but uh there are no we got we  got patrick seatman on staff now i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,15769120,15775439,sure yeah he might be interested we  might cook something up but we'll see  what happens there  uh all right will before we get to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15775439,15782479,spurs what has stood out to you in the  draft tonight we can kind of cycle  through some of the picks that have  happened so far uh you've obviously
KNl9UJkeEHM,15782479,15789040,followed the rockets for a long time  jabari smith at three that's pretty good  interesting you know i i just you have
KNl9UJkeEHM,15789040,15795120,mixed feelings about that as a rockets  fan because for weeks you thought carro  was going to be the guy three and
KNl9UJkeEHM,15795120,15801040,rockets fans were excited about that and  then it ends up being jabari smith i'm  just happy it's not chet holmgren i
KNl9UJkeEHM,15801040,15807840,encourage everyone to go follow at chat  sports tv on tick tock because there's a  pretty funny tick tock that we just post
KNl9UJkeEHM,15807840,15814080,on there my reaction to finding out it  wasn't going to be chat because chris  haynes posted on twitter that the pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,15814080,15819279,for okc was going to be smith which  would have meant chet to houston so i'm  just relieved it's not that but one of
KNl9UJkeEHM,15819279,15826479,the more underrated players in this  draft class in my opinion tori eason out  of lsu you talk about a power forward
KNl9UJkeEHM,15826479,15833279,who can shoot who has very very capable  ball handling skills well as well i  watched a lot of lsu this past season
KNl9UJkeEHM,15833279,15838479,harry and you would be surprised how  often eason was was running the point on
KNl9UJkeEHM,15838479,15845199,just random times in the game so he's a  good ball handler good score great  defender as well the rockets are putting
KNl9UJkeEHM,15845199,15852479,together something special with that  young core well you know it's hilarious  someone in the chat just sitting in a  ten dollar super chat they want ryan
KNl9UJkeEHM,15852479,15859680,zolchinsky  to take a beer bong  can we make it happen chinsky
KNl9UJkeEHM,15859680,15864880,chansky chan c chan ski our intern ryan
KNl9UJkeEHM,15864880,15871359,zolchinsky  is gonna take a beer bong on the liddy  cam so stay tuned we'll get to that in a
KNl9UJkeEHM,15871359,15876800,moment also  a thing about eason great defender oh  yeah really good defender well and
KNl9UJkeEHM,15876800,15883840,that's what the rockets really needed to  do tonight was was get defenders and ban  carrow is a very very good score he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,15883840,15889840,not known as much for his defense so  maybe it's uh maybe it's a win for the  rockets that they had a really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,15889840,15896000,defender in jabari smith and then add  another one at 17. they're coming up at  26. thanks to your maverick spurs on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15896000,15903199,clock right now yeah they traded  christian wood to dallas for 26 and uh  uh some uh deep bench guys z robinson
KNl9UJkeEHM,15903199,15909040,though the ten dollar shout out to you z  rob ryan zelchinski do a beer bong live
KNl9UJkeEHM,15909040,15914800,on the show so he's buckling up so once  he's ready to go we'll go check that out
KNl9UJkeEHM,15914800,15920000,as uh we're nearing the uh the end of  the first round here uh six picks to go
KNl9UJkeEHM,15920000,15925279,producer sam talking i do want to point  out something that the people won't  really get to see with ryan an electric
KNl9UJkeEHM,15925279,15931279,outfit with khaki pants white socks and  berks andy's got the ball look elite
KNl9UJkeEHM,15931279,15937600,that is a look and he's got the mullet  going mini bullets that dude  he's a legend he is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,15937600,15943439,legend no question what else has stood  out to you tonight  um well it's funny i i thought that
KNl9UJkeEHM,15943439,15949279,after the news broke earlier today about  the net situation i thought they would  be the biggest losers to come out of new
KNl9UJkeEHM,15949279,15954720,york but no it's still the new york  knicks  after what they did tonight i mean that
KNl9UJkeEHM,15954720,15959920,was wild when that was all going down i  mean i think that's going to be the the  big story to emerge from tonight even
KNl9UJkeEHM,15959920,15966399,more so than bancaro being uh the  surprising number one overall pick i  mean for a second we thought it was ivy
KNl9UJkeEHM,15966399,15973760,going to the knicks and then they don't  even get anybody they're clearly trying  to make a run at either jaylen brunson  or kyrie irving but but to give up a
KNl9UJkeEHM,15973760,15979680,first-round pick to clear i just i don't  know  and all the reports suggest brunson
KNl9UJkeEHM,15979680,15985600,wants to stay in dallas so to go this  route and if you don't get him then what  was the point is his dad is the
KNl9UJkeEHM,15985600,15992239,assistant for the next time i mean i'm  sure but he's he's been a coach in the  nba before it's not like he's  unqualified i don't think they hired him
KNl9UJkeEHM,15992239,16000000,just for a small chance to go get a  jalen brunson but we'll see what happens  here spurs on the clock uh here at 25
KNl9UJkeEHM,16000000,16008239,then you got the rockets heat warriors  in minnesota then denver will round out  the first round before we shift to round
KNl9UJkeEHM,16008239,16013520,two  uh we're going to get to the liddicam in  a moment can someone help zoe zolchinsky
KNl9UJkeEHM,16013520,16020080,let's get let's get the man some help uh  he's a better teammate than you had on  the on the beer bong that's for sure i
KNl9UJkeEHM,16020080,16027439,know that was that was tough that was  you but uh i apologize lessons learned  lessons i got it done i got it done that
KNl9UJkeEHM,16027439,16032960,that that get that i have to give a lot  of credit to you because even i had to  react
KNl9UJkeEHM,16034399,16039439,a lot of folks in the chat want to know  if kai soto is going to get picked we'll  see i think i think the celtics should
KNl9UJkeEHM,16039439,16045199,take them at 53. so if you're a kaisoto  fan  and you're watching this like the video
KNl9UJkeEHM,16045199,16051279,you can like the video first of all but  hashtag kai to boston and at me on  twitter can we throw my twitter up on
KNl9UJkeEHM,16051279,16056880,screen sam  will scott 44. we'll get to that in a  moment we got the liddycam
KNl9UJkeEHM,16056880,16062399,uh coming up oh he disappeared oh he's  barius he's up you're right
KNl9UJkeEHM,16062399,16068239,chug chug chug chug chug chug chug the  guy is doing it by himself
KNl9UJkeEHM,16068239,16074479,solo can you tell he's still in college  i mean that was quick is he done wow
KNl9UJkeEHM,16074479,16079520,that was impressive zolchinsky with the  beer bong  that
KNl9UJkeEHM,16079520,16087040,quickly  wow uh okay the pick is uh in here for  san antonio as they're gonna select
KNl9UJkeEHM,16087040,16093199,blake wesley out of notre dame here at  the number 25 pick overall that'll bring
KNl9UJkeEHM,16093199,16099680,the rockets onto the clock in a second  we'll talk about this pick uh a little  uh here for
KNl9UJkeEHM,16099680,16104880,san antonio so blake wesley out of notre  dame kind of got some late buzz or some
KNl9UJkeEHM,16104880,16110319,chatter he could sneak into round one  and he does here at number 25 overall
KNl9UJkeEHM,16110319,16117520,out of notre dame i can pull up some  numbers here  we can talk about him just a little bit  more but wesley the selection out of the
KNl9UJkeEHM,16117520,16123279,firing otter 6'5 a little light buck 85  but average 14 and a half points per  game
KNl9UJkeEHM,16123279,16128640,40 from the field only 30 percent from  three not a great shooter but he's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,16128640,16134159,really good ball handler can get to the  basket and a pretty good defender as  well here will yeah there were a lot of
KNl9UJkeEHM,16134159,16139760,rumors that he was going to sneak into  the first round he and he does uh only
KNl9UJkeEHM,16139760,16146159,30 from three and when you're looking at  the stat line  from notre dame last year that's kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,16146159,16151760,what stands out i mean you want a  shooting car to be able to hit threes a  little bit more often than that but you
KNl9UJkeEHM,16151760,16157439,do mention he's a good ball handler the  upside is there with him and it's going  to be interesting to see you know kind
KNl9UJkeEHM,16157439,16162479,of the direction san antonio goes in i  think pretty much every draft pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,16162479,16167520,they're going to have the next couple  years is really going to set the tone  for the future of that franchise so they
KNl9UJkeEHM,16167520,16173520,go with wesley here who is one of the  better shooting guards  in terms of just athleticism and upside
KNl9UJkeEHM,16173520,16178880,in the acc last year one and done young  prospect still has a lot of time to grow
KNl9UJkeEHM,16178880,16186000,uh but yeah i think what'll make or  break him is if he can develop a more  consistent shooting stroke so appreciate
KNl9UJkeEHM,16186000,16192319,uh will joining us uh here as chase  senior has stepped aside uh san antonio  has already made three picks though will
KNl9UJkeEHM,16192319,16198479,they've been busy tonight they get  jeremy sohan the forward out of baylor  malachi branham out of ohio state blake
KNl9UJkeEHM,16198479,16205359,wesley out of notre dame three power  five college players heading down to san  antonio which is kind of a shift from
KNl9UJkeEHM,16205359,16212080,them they love their international  prospects but uh three guys in the top  25 that played a major college
KNl9UJkeEHM,16212080,16218640,basketball i really like sohan and you  know the numbers aren't anything crazy  with him i mean nine points per game six
KNl9UJkeEHM,16218640,16224399,and a half rebounds per game for baylor  last season but i mean you can just see  the upside is there with this guy and i
KNl9UJkeEHM,16224399,16230479,think he was worthy of a top 10 pick and  then they go with branham and and wesley  their last two picks so the spurs we
KNl9UJkeEHM,16230479,16237279,knew coming in they were gonna have a  lot of picks and uh they're certainly  making the most of them right now  greater picks so far zero to 100 to 100
KNl9UJkeEHM,16237279,16244080,being uh they've nailed the draft zero  being it's been awful we do have some  trade details finally uh on what's going
KNl9UJkeEHM,16244080,16250239,on with the new york knicks uh we'll get  to those in a second but sean churanya  says that the knicks will re receive a
KNl9UJkeEHM,16250239,16256000,2023 protected first rounder 2023 uh  from detroit by the way another 2023
KNl9UJkeEHM,16256000,16262000,protected first rounder from washington  and a third one from denver so knicks
KNl9UJkeEHM,16262000,16267199,are getting three first-round picks and  as far as it pertains to this year
KNl9UJkeEHM,16267199,16272880,clearing cap space to try and make a run  at a big time free agent like a jalen  bronson or maybe a kyrie irving trade
KNl9UJkeEHM,16272880,16278720,yeah i think kyrie might be you know who  they're going for here obviously brunson
KNl9UJkeEHM,16278720,16284880,has been linked to them but  you knew coming into tonight they wanted  ivy and they were going to do a lot to
KNl9UJkeEHM,16284880,16290560,get them and apparently they just didn't  do enough but they do get a couple of  future first-round picks but for a
KNl9UJkeEHM,16290560,16297120,coaching staff and for a front office  that really needs to win now i'm really  surprised to see them loading up on
KNl9UJkeEHM,16297120,16304319,picks however they might flip those  picks to trade for let's say a kyrie  irving or something like that the  rocket's next pick is in will and as our
KNl9UJkeEHM,16304319,16312399,resident rockets fan we'll let you break  this down here wendell moore jr a guy  who shot 41 from three at duke last year
KNl9UJkeEHM,16312399,16317840,three-year college player uh a guy who  can really shoot the basketball yeah i i
KNl9UJkeEHM,16317840,16324080,like the pick and you know they go with  another big name here much like the  spurs they go with a couple of power
KNl9UJkeEHM,16324080,16329760,five college guys with their first three  selections and he lit up the statue last
KNl9UJkeEHM,16329760,16335439,year for the blue devils 13 and a half  points per game  five rebounds per game so
KNl9UJkeEHM,16335439,16341120,i figured he'd still be on the board  here i figured the rockets might target  this guy and uh you know he's gonna be
KNl9UJkeEHM,16341120,16347600,able to come off the bench and do some  things well for you obviously it comes  from a winning culture which is what  houston's trying to get back to with
KNl9UJkeEHM,16347600,16355920,their new era of basketball he really  broke out this past year will his  freshman year seven and a half points  sophomore year 7 9.7 this year 13 and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,16355920,16361600,half improved as a creator two jumped  his assist from 2.7 per game to 4.4 uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,16361600,16367920,and just the overall efficiency well i  think this is what really stands out as  freshman and sophomore year 41.6 41.7
KNl9UJkeEHM,16367920,16375920,percent from the field this year 50 from  the field as a guard which is really  impressive 41.3 percent from three-point
KNl9UJkeEHM,16375920,16382880,range so staying another year in college  really paid off and now he gets rewarded  by being a round pick in the nba draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,16382880,16390639,yeah and it's it's interesting i i  thought they might go big man whoa  we're trading this player to the dallas
KNl9UJkeEHM,16390639,16397039,mavericks  whoa  another it's going back to dallas they
KNl9UJkeEHM,16397039,16402879,sending christian wood back to houston  please i don't think so  i don't think so
KNl9UJkeEHM,16402879,16410080,we'll go to houston  i don't think that's happening  window more today so y'all y'all get the
KNl9UJkeEHM,16410080,16415119,the pic after all so what  yeah so what but the mavericks don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,16415119,16420160,have a pick it has to be a future first  it's got to be a future first 2025 first
KNl9UJkeEHM,16420160,16426561,maybe the mavericks can trade their 2025  first and they're 2027 first
KNl9UJkeEHM,16426561,16432879,maybe  would they have another source off here  okay another source off so shams two
KNl9UJkeEHM,16432879,16438160,minutes ago saying houston will pick one  dell moore  woes saying minnesota was landing on
KNl9UJkeEHM,16438160,16443279,wendell i don't know where that came  from  a lot of content delivered tweet did the
KNl9UJkeEHM,16443279,16451680,woes deleted the tweet was deleted blows  deleted the tweet  toms is bodying him
KNl9UJkeEHM,16465199,16471680,this time so minnesota  is gonna land window more  then what how are the mavericks the
KNl9UJkeEHM,16471680,16478400,mavic mavericks aren't involved okay  you know what this is  the pick was initially dallas's
KNl9UJkeEHM,16478400,16485279,and these guys forgot and that's the  confusion here okay that's the only  thing that makes sense so minnesota
KNl9UJkeEHM,16485279,16492240,acquired the pick from houston that  originated from dallas via the christian  wood church minnesota their next pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,16492240,16497920,was going to be 40th overall  i'm going to assume and we don't have  the details yet we'll get that to you
KNl9UJkeEHM,16497920,16505680,when we know  but you have to stop that it's going to  be it's going to be maybe a future first  mate they have the 40 and 48 29. they
KNl9UJkeEHM,16505680,16508719,have picked 29 as well
KNl9UJkeEHM,16512799,16518719,if you love the chaos like the video i  mean my goodness this is what we're  doing here we're doing it all on the fly
KNl9UJkeEHM,16518719,16526080,and uh shams and woj exchanging  haymakers it had been all shams until  just now and now woj
KNl9UJkeEHM,16526080,16532879,he hits a little 18 foot j to get back  into the fight tonight so  wendell moore going to minnesota so
KNl9UJkeEHM,16532879,16538320,we'll update you guys on that once those  tray details are in uh the heat are on

KNl9UJkeEHM,16594400,16600959,favorite i mean this guy  you watch his highlights and he's  unbelievable i mean he's 6 11 and he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,16600959,16607279,running  i mean he's he's absolutely unbelievable  so uh i i have him right now is probably
KNl9UJkeEHM,16607279,16614240,my best available and i was kind of  rooting for the rockets to take him at  27 but they end up uh trading that pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,16614240,16620160,anyway so 26 mark  miami would be interesting because he  doesn't have to help you right away
KNl9UJkeEHM,16620160,16626240,they're plenty deep so maybe you draft  and stash him for a year or two let him  develop and then in a couple of years
KNl9UJkeEHM,16626240,16631279,he's a part of that core so that would  be interesting kendall brown an  interesting player kennedy chandler one
KNl9UJkeEHM,16631279,16636561,of the best athletes in this class had  about a 42-inch vertical uh at the nba

KNl9UJkeEHM,16800560,16806638,it i like it man  this is a guy you don't need him to play  right away let him continue to develop
KNl9UJkeEHM,16806638,16812878,this heat core is deep and uh  i think it's possible will that we look  back in five years and it's like this is
KNl9UJkeEHM,16812878,16818638,a top five or ten player in this class i  absolutely agree and you know kyle lowry  is getting up there and age a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,16818638,16826560,i could see jovich in a couple years  maybe being their franchise point guard  even though he's 6-11 his ball handling
KNl9UJkeEHM,16826560,16834400,skills are great he can throw it down he  can get in the paint do some work he's  so quick down the floor man i love this
KNl9UJkeEHM,16834400,16839760,pick one of the best picks in this draft  class thus far yeah and i think yovic a
KNl9UJkeEHM,16839760,16845360,couple of things one he's still a little  bit raw i think he's got to put on some  weight the body is very immature still
KNl9UJkeEHM,16845360,16851840,he's only 18 years old the defensive  skills have got to improve but he's  talented offensively open court running
KNl9UJkeEHM,16851840,16857840,and gunning on the fast break really  good guy that can distribute get to the  basket um you know he needs to get
KNl9UJkeEHM,16857840,16863360,stronger as a player at 6 11 he needs to  be a bit of a better rebounder but uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,16863360,16869920,he's skilled man he is really really  skilled i think this is probably a two  or three year type of project uh but uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,16869920,16875920,he's got the upside i like this  selection he's played professional  basketball for a few years uh be very
KNl9UJkeEHM,16875920,16881120,fascinated to see how he ends up with  miami i think miami  will one of the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,16881120,16887920,talent developers in the nba along with  the franchise like the toronto raptors  they do really well with these type of
KNl9UJkeEHM,16887920,16892958,prospects i think this is a perfect  landing spot for him yeah and when you  look at the upside you look at the
KNl9UJkeEHM,16892958,16900160,ceiling his ceiling is incredibly high  like you said probably going to be a two  or three year project might not play
KNl9UJkeEHM,16900160,16905520,right away in south beach but man  his ceiling is incredibly high we got a

KNl9UJkeEHM,16954160,16960320,don't know how much this is worth uh  this australian currency thoughts about  houston and their future we'll take this
KNl9UJkeEHM,16960320,16966798,one away yeah i uh i'm from the hoozie  man i'm excited about what the rockets  are building and it was important for
KNl9UJkeEHM,16966798,16973200,them tonight to add defenders they did  that with jabari smith they did that  with tori eason they're going to do that
KNl9UJkeEHM,16973200,16979280,again here in a second at pick 29  hopefully so  i think this is the last this upcoming
KNl9UJkeEHM,16979280,16984480,season will be the last rebuilding year  for the rockets they want this next year
KNl9UJkeEHM,16984480,16990160,to be their last year in the lottery  then they want to be a playoff team and  then they want to contend this is an
KNl9UJkeEHM,16990160,16996638,organization that's staying patient  trying to rebuild a championship  contender and that's the timeline that
KNl9UJkeEHM,16996638,17002798,makes sense you know why because john  wall's off your books after next year  once you clear that 40 well he is he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,17002798,17008320,in the last year once you clear that 40  45 million  then  if you've taken enough steps you can be
KNl9UJkeEHM,17008320,17014320,aggressive in free agency you got draft  picks you can trade you got cap space so  uh we'll see what happens there all
KNl9UJkeEHM,17014320,17020160,right the defending champs on the clock  here at 28 they also have a couple of  picks at 51 and 55. there's been some
KNl9UJkeEHM,17020160,17025440,rumors will that maybe the warriors  would package this pick and some sort of
KNl9UJkeEHM,17025440,17033280,trade or simply just move back just  because they're already so much into the  luxury tax uh but if you're golden state
KNl9UJkeEHM,17033280,17038400,you know iguodala is probably going to  retire so you could use some kind of  three and d type of player
KNl9UJkeEHM,17038400,17044958,center's a bit of a question mark with  kavon looney as a free agent and uh and  uh james wiseman's future somewhat
KNl9UJkeEHM,17044958,17050638,unclear uh maybe a couple of spots you  could go here yeah it's gonna be  interesting to see what they can do you
KNl9UJkeEHM,17050638,17056798,know i was talking about yesterday on on  celtics today here at chat sports that  it was rumored that the seas actually
KNl9UJkeEHM,17056798,17062080,wanted to trade up to this spot at 28.  it looks like the warriors are going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,17062080,17068320,pick still plenty of talent left on the  board and we've seen golden state have  some phenomenal draft picks over the
KNl9UJkeEHM,17068320,17075240,years kind of late first round early  second round ty ty washington has  somehow fallen all the way
KNl9UJkeEHM,17075240,17080638,228 still uh jayden hardy on the board  too i really liked him washington a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,17080638,17087120,with backup point guard potential here i  mean you could just go best value there  now here's what we know is a fact here
KNl9UJkeEHM,17087120,17093360,at shout sports a lot of philippines  fans that are a fan of the nba a lot of  warriors fans
KNl9UJkeEHM,17093360,17099680,from the philippines as well so if  you're pushing p  for the philippines type p in the chat

KNl9UJkeEHM,17105440,17110878,sounds like he does though so he can  give some shout outs uh and then we will  uh get to this selection because it
KNl9UJkeEHM,17110878,17119360,sounds like the pick is in but go ahead  and give some joshua pablo shout out to  you steve duran chase de god j dub 23

KNl9UJkeEHM,17149120,17156080,the pick is in how about this patrick  baldwin jr will who was one of the  biggest recruits in the last uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,17156080,17161120,recruiting cycle for college basketball  i actually respected him a lot for this
KNl9UJkeEHM,17161120,17166240,opted to play for his dad at the  university of milwaukee hbcu stayed
KNl9UJkeEHM,17166240,17171520,local stayed home  didn't perform super well but iskit's
KNl9UJkeEHM,17171520,17176560,got massive potential 610 he's got the  shooting upside the stroke
KNl9UJkeEHM,17176560,17182480,didn't connect with a lot of high  percentage scoring but  i like this for golden state you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,17182480,17188560,why they don't need a lot of win now  pieces go have this guy play in the g  league a bunch this year you know what i
KNl9UJkeEHM,17188560,17195440,mean get a lot of reps down there see  what he can be down the road well based  on the warriors recent draft picks this
KNl9UJkeEHM,17195440,17200878,guy might be a future all-star i mean  that organization  knows how to draft i think you're right
KNl9UJkeEHM,17200878,17207280,you know they don't need win now guys  right now like some of these other teams  that are going to be on the clock soon  so they're going to be they're gonna be
KNl9UJkeEHM,17207280,17213520,just fine he's gonna be just fine let  him develop in the g league this year  like he said he's coming off somewhat of
KNl9UJkeEHM,17213520,17219920,a disappointing season at milwaukee i  thought he's gonna put up much bigger  numbers than he did 12.1 points per game
KNl9UJkeEHM,17219920,17226320,5.8 rebounds per game so in that in the  g league next year i think he can  develop and maybe become an impact
KNl9UJkeEHM,17226320,17232080,player for golden state that next season  we'll get to the rockets here in a  moment uh but uh do want to shout out or
KNl9UJkeEHM,17232080,17237680,our presenting sponsor here tonight for  the nba draft and listen um will are you

KNl9UJkeEHM,17305840,17312718,raptors and what they might do at 33.  i mean  i like that listen toronto knows how to
KNl9UJkeEHM,17312718,17318080,develop i mean that's just a fact i mean  we all laughed at them for scotty barnes  last year the guy is the freaking rookie
KNl9UJkeEHM,17318080,17324638,of the year i mean that's what they do  every  i was immediately i was scratching my  head when they made that fred van vleeth
KNl9UJkeEHM,17324638,17330798,pascal siacombe all they do is develop  talent i mean that's all they do so  whoever they pick it's gonna be a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,17330798,17338718,that works out probably based on their  track record and by the way will you're  going to be fired up the houston rockets
KNl9UJkeEHM,17338718,17344878,have selected ty ty washington out of  kentucky who a lot of people thought
KNl9UJkeEHM,17344878,17350080,would go in the lottery  and he goes 29 overall now the shooting
KNl9UJkeEHM,17350080,17356000,has not  completely translated but he's got the  skills to be a good two-way player this
KNl9UJkeEHM,17356000,17362560,is a steal you're talking about a top 15  prospect that has fallen to the rockets
KNl9UJkeEHM,17362560,17367760,at 29 not only do they get tight they  just got multiple second round picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,17367760,17372878,from minnesota as well after moving back  just three spots they need point guard
KNl9UJkeEHM,17372878,17378718,depth behind kevin porter jr they just  got it the rockets have won the draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,17378718,17385280,thus far non-biased opinion jabari smith  tori eason ty ty washington junior i got
KNl9UJkeEHM,17385280,17390958,to agree i don't know hey sec scc i know  scc i know there's a bit of homerism
KNl9UJkeEHM,17390958,17397040,over there with the rockets and with the  sec but i like what they've done man i  think these are three guys that can give
KNl9UJkeEHM,17397040,17403920,you minutes as a rookie uh as rookies  this year and like you said winning this  year doesn't matter but getting these
KNl9UJkeEHM,17403920,17409600,guys experience is important and then  the year after the next when you have  cap space go make some moves they want
KNl9UJkeEHM,17409600,17416240,next year to be their last year in the  lottery yes that is the goal we're not  talking about three years from now
KNl9UJkeEHM,17416240,17422878,they're still like the thunder and we're  gonna have the second overall pick they  want to contend soon not like next year
KNl9UJkeEHM,17422878,17428400,20 25 next three four years real  contenders absolutely yeah i think  that's what you're shooting for i got to
KNl9UJkeEHM,17428400,17435040,give this up yeah i'm seeing 98 come in  i would say 93.94 this is an a this is
KNl9UJkeEHM,17435040,17441760,an a there's no doubt about it 74 that's  disrespectful jw  mike dibble with the 95 i think that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,17441760,17448080,appropriate i don't know if any draft  can be at 100 because the nba draft's  such a crap shoot but uh on paper the
KNl9UJkeEHM,17448080,17454320,rockets have had a hell of a night  there's no there's no doubt about it and  you know keep in mind as well that it
KNl9UJkeEHM,17454320,17459360,looks like the brooklyn nets are falling  apart and the rockets own their picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,17459360,17464798,for the next five years up until 2027  you have to give a lot of credit to
KNl9UJkeEHM,17464798,17470480,rafael stone the new rockets gm he has  done a sensational job not an easy job
KNl9UJkeEHM,17470480,17477040,replacing daryl moore well  not at all because maury traded so many  picks and trying to win which i don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,17477040,17482160,blame him for but that was a tough job  to inherit and i think he's doing a  great job i like what they've done the
KNl9UJkeEHM,17482160,17487520,past couple of years in the draft so the  denver nuggets were kind of rolling
KNl9UJkeEHM,17487520,17493520,through the picks on screen for you guys  if you've missed any picks but now  denver on the clock will to round out
KNl9UJkeEHM,17493520,17499760,the draft um or the first round of the  draft we'll have second round coverage  as well uh what are you thinking here
KNl9UJkeEHM,17499760,17508240,for denver at 30 i like the pick they  made earlier  at 29 a win now piece in christian brown
KNl9UJkeEHM,17508240,17514798,some think it's a little early but  that's a roster if michael porter gets  healthy and if jamal murray gets healthy
KNl9UJkeEHM,17514798,17521600,they're ready to contend right now i  like to win now peace there we'll see  what they do here at 30. ej liddell win
KNl9UJkeEHM,17521600,17527360,now players i would like it yeah i think  ej liddell might make some sense kennedy
KNl9UJkeEHM,17527360,17533600,chandler as well i really like him but  the player right now in my opinion and  i'm curious to hear what you think that
KNl9UJkeEHM,17533600,17539360,i think has the the highest ceiling the  most upside is jaden hardy yeah i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,17539360,17545360,if i turn to the other side yes in terms  if i was denver i would go with hardy  right now
KNl9UJkeEHM,17545360,17550480,yeah he he he's got big time potential  these geely guys are weird because none
KNl9UJkeEHM,17550480,17556958,of them shot the ball that well but i  also i'm like they played in the g  league this pro this g-league route
KNl9UJkeEHM,17556958,17563280,isn't really defined at this point they  kind of just run around and jack up  shots i don't know
KNl9UJkeEHM,17563280,17570400,like how defined that is yet  but he's got huge potential six four  almost 200 pounds he's got
KNl9UJkeEHM,17570400,17575680,a big body for a guy who can run point  or the two guard but you know you could  go two rounds you could go with a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,17575680,17581120,like that where two years from now he  could be a potential all-star or you  could go ej liddell who probably won't
KNl9UJkeEHM,17581120,17586560,ever be an all-star but a guy who could  be a contributor right away i'll be  curious to see what the approach is here
KNl9UJkeEHM,17586560,17591760,for denver and maybe that's what they do  because this is a big year for the  nuggets man i mean they they they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,17591760,17600080,coming off a pretty disappointing season  a pretty disappointing porter and murray  man i know they had injury concerns uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,17600080,17605920,but yeah this is a big year man this is  a big year for them yeah they need to  uh to nail this i'll say this it might
KNl9UJkeEHM,17605920,17611360,be a little early but a backup center  christian koloko is a guy i really like
KNl9UJkeEHM,17611360,17617120,a great show one of the best protectors  in this draft yeah he he just swats  balls into the crowd man he's really
KNl9UJkeEHM,17617120,17623200,good uh at defending that rim so uh  we'll see what the pick is here uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,17623200,17628958,let's go ahead and get to the pick here  sam it just came in and then we'll go to  this let's round out the first round
KNl9UJkeEHM,17628958,17634400,peyton watson out of ucla  uh one of the higher uh players
KNl9UJkeEHM,17634400,17640638,available on the board 68 200 big  recruit  didn't do that much at ucla though so
KNl9UJkeEHM,17640638,17647360,this is kind of a  i i view the brown pick as a guy who can  help them right away well maybe watson's
KNl9UJkeEHM,17647360,17652560,a guy they want to give a year or two to  develop a little bit more no this guy  rode the bench at ucla last year like
KNl9UJkeEHM,17652560,17658480,you mentioned he was a 15 player in the  2021 recruiting class and was expected
KNl9UJkeEHM,17658480,17664480,to be a one-and-done he is but he was  probably this time last year expected to  be taken a little bit higher he he
KNl9UJkeEHM,17664480,17671520,played in 32 games for the bruins last  season but just averaged three a game  yeah three points per game 22 from three
KNl9UJkeEHM,17671520,17678638,he just never really found his footing  but a five-star recruit and i don't mind  this for denver because number one
KNl9UJkeEHM,17678638,17684878,you've got a deep roster of healthy if  you're the nuggets you go seven eight  nine ten deep when you're healthy you
KNl9UJkeEHM,17684878,17690000,got christian brown who can help you  right now give watson a year or two see  if he can develop sure he's got bus
KNl9UJkeEHM,17690000,17695440,potential  but this is a guy like you said who was  a top 10 top 15 recruit just a couple of
KNl9UJkeEHM,17695440,17702240,years ago so i don't mind this approach  obviously it may not work out but this  is the nba draft will at least half
KNl9UJkeEHM,17702240,17709040,these picks probably aren't going to pan  out it's not like the nfl draft where in  the first round most guys hit that's not
KNl9UJkeEHM,17709040,17714240,necessarily the case here right and when  you're looking at these two guys i i
KNl9UJkeEHM,17714240,17720638,don't know how i feel about the watson  pick however i really like the christian  brown pick and you know you can make the  argument they reached on him a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,17720638,17727040,bit brown is expected to go late first  early second watson kind of early second  as well so you can make the argument
KNl9UJkeEHM,17727040,17732718,they reached on both of these guys i  would give the brown pick probably b  plus watts and not so much i'm not
KNl9UJkeEHM,17732718,17738080,thrilled about that pick just based on  what he did last year so the first round  is in the books pacers will lead off the
KNl9UJkeEHM,17738080,17743600,second round but here's the deal we  haven't played this game yet we played  it a lot during the nfl draft so for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,17743600,17750638,next minute i'm gonna pull out my  stopwatch here on my phone for the next  minute every five dollar super chat that
KNl9UJkeEHM,17750638,17756958,comes in  equals a shot of fireball whether it's  from me  from will from other guys on the ladycam

KNl9UJkeEHM,17797680,17804638,just got a second one by the way if this  was 1983 it'd be a top three pick great  point old school big not sure he
KNl9UJkeEHM,17804638,17810958,translates to today's nba  fair to say yeah i would i would agree  with that uh i would still drop them
KNl9UJkeEHM,17810958,17817440,though yeah i think mid late second  round he could make some sense uh 10  seconds by the way kyle castroline uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,17817440,17824320,says i want mitchell wrens i'm not sure  what that means do you think he wants to  take a shot let's

KNl9UJkeEHM,17981040,17986480,two and one who are we talking about  well jack says mavs the mavericks i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,17986480,17991600,let you take this one i will take this  yeah youtube.com mavs tv or dallas
KNl9UJkeEHM,17991600,17998798,mavericks coverage uh we've talked a  great channel man we talked about kai  soto over there a lot by the way and you  guys have loved it but uh no picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,17998798,18005840,tonight uh there's been some buzz maybe  they'll trade into the second round  we'll see that was fun for a second when  uh i know tweeting that jawline the fake
KNl9UJkeEHM,18005840,18012160,trade i know good times i know that was  shams actually oh he took the l on  that one uh but traded for christian
KNl9UJkeEHM,18012160,18018000,woods so  you get another big i think you could  add another big i don't think dwight  powell is a guy that should be a part of
KNl9UJkeEHM,18018000,18024638,this uh  team moving forward  you know  more help next to luca
KNl9UJkeEHM,18024638,18031200,jalen brunson bringing him back is a big  priority sounds like the new york knicks  are going to make a run for him but look
KNl9UJkeEHM,18031200,18036798,coming off a great year made good  progress you you broke through in the  playoffs hadn't won a series yet with
KNl9UJkeEHM,18036798,18043200,luca you win two uh i think beating  phoenix in that game seven on the road  was real important for this team moving
KNl9UJkeEHM,18043200,18048958,forward and this core  obviously lost the warriors but they  wanted all so no harm there
KNl9UJkeEHM,18048958,18054638,i think just continuing to kind of build  around doncic is going to be the way to  go all right the second round gets
KNl9UJkeEHM,18054638,18061760,underway here andrew nimhard will  five-year college guy starts his career  at florida ends up at gonzaga there were
KNl9UJkeEHM,18061760,18070000,some buzz he could go kind of in this  range late first early second uh veteran  player but uh i think uh this is a guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,18070000,18076320,that rick carlisle will like because  he's a smart point guard uh ceiling not  super high but i think it's a second
KNl9UJkeEHM,18076320,18083120,round pick uh the the pick is okay here  i don't mind it at all yeah i agree i i  like this pick you know i figured he'd
KNl9UJkeEHM,18083120,18090560,go pretty early in the second round like  you mentioned that's plenty of  experience four years in college two at
KNl9UJkeEHM,18090560,18098240,florida tour gonzaga put up nearly 12  points per game for the zags last season  a really good shooter shot 38
KNl9UJkeEHM,18098240,18104958,from three so yeah i see him going in  and maybe contribute contributing on  that indiana team yeah so we'll see uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,18104958,18111760,how that plays out uh but indiana kind  of in a interesting spot trade rumors  around malcolm brogdon and miles turner
KNl9UJkeEHM,18111760,18116958,we'll see if those two guys could be on  the move but a couple of guys they've  taken tonight benedict nathan and now
KNl9UJkeEHM,18116958,18123200,andrew nimhard uh their two selections  so orlando back on the clock at 32 they
KNl9UJkeEHM,18123200,18131440,traded the 35th pick to the lakers who  are gonna be selecting  soon enough at 35 so stay tuned for that
KNl9UJkeEHM,18131440,18137760,um but uh for now the magic are on the  clock expect the second round to gain  some steam i think it'll go a little bit

KNl9UJkeEHM,18181840,18187280,upside if he continues to improve as a  shooter  yeah you know i i agree he has some
KNl9UJkeEHM,18187280,18194638,upside for sure just uh just a freshman  at michigan  last season was a five-star recruit out
KNl9UJkeEHM,18194638,18201280,of florida and uh you know he's  certainly been on the one-and-done radar  for quite some time he goes early in the

KNl9UJkeEHM,18431280,18437920,i want him to go to a team  where he can't contribute on a contender
KNl9UJkeEHM,18437920,18443920,i'm not saying the knicks or contender  there they have a little bit more work  to do to get to that point but they
KNl9UJkeEHM,18443920,18449120,could really use a guy like him to come  in right away because any team that  takes williams in the second round i do
KNl9UJkeEHM,18449120,18456240,believe he's gonna get drafted they are  getting in my opinion a first-round  talent he was the best player in the acc
KNl9UJkeEHM,18456240,18462400,last year nathaniel bautista says we  want kai soto come on
KNl9UJkeEHM,18462400,18469520,kai soto if we got nba gm's watching the  stream take kai soto you will not regret
KNl9UJkeEHM,18469520,18476080,it an international superstar from the  philippines gonna be the steal of the  draft if he gets taken but if he doesn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,18476080,18482638,get taken we might have to throw  together a udfa destinations video on  kaisoto so subscribe to the channel

KNl9UJkeEHM,18494958,18501440,you're talking about kai soto  destinations i have to think the boston  celtics at 53 are a potential
KNl9UJkeEHM,18501440,18507520,destination for kai because if kai's  drafted it's likely gonna be later on in
KNl9UJkeEHM,18507520,18516638,the second round the celtics desperately  maybe not desperately they need some  depth down low kaisoto at 7-2 would
KNl9UJkeEHM,18516638,18521680,certainly provide that maybe another  team that could use kaisoto or the
KNl9UJkeEHM,18521680,18528958,lakers they have a pick coming up here  at 35 pretty quickly another team that  could use kaisoto maybe is the udfa the
KNl9UJkeEHM,18528958,18535440,dallas mavericks or maybe another team  so be sure to go to our celtics channel  subscribe to that our mavericks channel

KNl9UJkeEHM,18664480,18671360,like the video if you want us to say his  name because hey i hope he gets drafted  i'm pulling for the guy yeah uh we'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,18671360,18677840,see if it happens he deserves to get  drafted uh we'll see if that happens  they get a super chat come in a couple
KNl9UJkeEHM,18677840,18685520,actually simply ace when is beau cruz  getting drafted i'm hearing that the  boston celtics sit up at 53 or seriously
KNl9UJkeEHM,18685520,18691680,considering taking beau cruz and the  sixers have been linked to beau cruz  throughout this draft process but
KNl9UJkeEHM,18691680,18698718,apparently ownership does not have a  good relationship with beau cruz's  personal trainer but i am hearing
KNl9UJkeEHM,18698718,18706638,sources are confirming keep in mind i am  the host of celtics today sources are  telling me that the boston celtics at 53
KNl9UJkeEHM,18706638,18713360,are the favorites to take beau cruz late  in the second round someone that can  contribute right away hasn't played
KNl9UJkeEHM,18713360,18719440,hasn't played organized basketball in  eight years but man he put on a show at  the combine some of these private
KNl9UJkeEHM,18719440,18725280,workouts he has been going off beau cruz  someone to keep an eye on as we move  into the second round we'll get to this
KNl9UJkeEHM,18725280,18731600,super chat and then the pick is in so  we'll get to that pingzo he's calling a  shot i can't read his name i'm calling
KNl9UJkeEHM,18731600,18737600,it mr soto to the lakers  like i said i think it's 35. we'll see
KNl9UJkeEHM,18737600,18745120,we shall see now the pick is in at 33.  this is classic raptors because i love  this pick i absolutely love this pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,18745120,18748796,christian koloko will
KNl9UJkeEHM,18751520,18758480,great shot blocker good finisher around  the rim he's never going to be a guy i  don't think that develops a outside jump
KNl9UJkeEHM,18758480,18763520,shot maybe with time in mid-ranger we'll  see but that's not really his game but
KNl9UJkeEHM,18763520,18770560,koloko who i watched in the ncaa  tournament against my alma mater tcu he  was swatting shots into the fourth row
KNl9UJkeEHM,18770560,18776320,consistently seven feet 220 pounds i  think he can add a little bit to that  frame but almost three blocks per game
KNl9UJkeEHM,18776320,18781760,good rebounder uh can be a kind of pick  and roll guy can uh be an above the rim
KNl9UJkeEHM,18781760,18788000,type of player uh free throw shooting  improved a little raw offensively but a  guy who can defend at a pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,18788000,18794320,level this guy's going to be good harry  i i have really really a lot of  confidence in what koloko's going to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,18794320,18799680,able to do and that's a perfect fit i  think for him in toronto with that  organization organization that is known
KNl9UJkeEHM,18799680,18805680,for developing a lot of talent koloko  last season had a huge jump was a part  of an arizona team that was the number
KNl9UJkeEHM,18805680,18810798,one seed in the ncaa tournament nearly  13 points per game seven and a half
KNl9UJkeEHM,18810798,18817600,rebounds per game i think this guy is  going to develop into a borderline  all-star player wow that's how good i
KNl9UJkeEHM,18817600,18822798,think koloko is going to be one of if  not the best rim protectors in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,18822798,18828878,draft yeah great shot blogger i think at  worse you got a good defensive backup  center at best he's a high level starter
KNl9UJkeEHM,18828878,18836400,we'll see over time what he ends up  being so koloko lands in toronto early  in round two at 33 and now the oklahoma
KNl9UJkeEHM,18836400,18841840,city thunder are back on the clock and  uh they're already ready to rock and  roll we'll take a look at our best
KNl9UJkeEHM,18841840,18848638,available here kendall brown the wing  out of baylor i'm surprised ej liddell  has fallen into round two i think why do
KNl9UJkeEHM,18848638,18855280,you think that is i think nba teams  worry about what the hell is his  position like he's six seven but he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,18855280,18860878,really like  i think offensively  he's a small ball five
KNl9UJkeEHM,18860878,18867440,like i you know what i compared him to  do you remember dejuan blair  who played with the mavericks and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,18867440,18874240,spurs he's dejuan blair with the  three-point shot so what is he is he uh  is he a five is he a four i'm not sure
KNl9UJkeEHM,18874240,18880638,maybe he's more of a four yeah i think  there's questions there about the  defense too uh worked on his body a lot
KNl9UJkeEHM,18880638,18886718,last year but uh uh you know the  conditioning has been a question in the  past jaden hardy kennedy chandler still
KNl9UJkeEHM,18886718,18892638,in the word chandler one of the best  athletes he's a 40-plus inch vertical  guy  but the pick is already in here jalen
KNl9UJkeEHM,18892638,18898240,williams out of arkansas gonna go to  oklahoma city 6-10-237
KNl9UJkeEHM,18898240,18904480,uh double-double guy last year 11 and 10  uh on the average uh still just 19 years
KNl9UJkeEHM,18904480,18910638,old gosh you know i have mixed feelings  about this because  i looked at williams as a late second
KNl9UJkeEHM,18910638,18915680,round guy  i thought whatever team got him would be  getting value there this might be a
KNl9UJkeEHM,18915680,18922000,little bit of a reach from okc and you  know williams has stocked his risen in  in the last couple weeks he had a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,18922000,18927840,combine he's impressed uh every team  he's worked out for but  this this is a little bit of a reach
KNl9UJkeEHM,18927840,18935040,taking a pretty early in round two yeah  you know you look at the composite  ranking there 46 overall he goes 34 so
KNl9UJkeEHM,18935040,18942638,certainly at least according to  you know outlets who study this stuff uh  heavily uh which we do as well but a bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,18942638,18949120,of a read you know 12 13 picks there so  not outrageous uh but a guy who probably  would have gone mid late second ends up
KNl9UJkeEHM,18949120,18956480,going early second so obviously oklahoma  city saw something here his ceiling is  like pretty jalen williams yeah santa
KNl9UJkeEHM,18956480,18961680,clara and arkansas that is wild man did  did they pick them just for the memes
KNl9UJkeEHM,18961680,18968080,probably some chat home grin oozeman  jang jalen williams jalen williams i  mean we know this about okc
KNl9UJkeEHM,18968080,18974240,they take gambles they like these like  boom and bust type of guys so i don't  know how i feel about the rebuild over
KNl9UJkeEHM,18974240,18981200,there  i just don't know yeah it's you know  it reminds me  it reminds me of this it reminds me of
KNl9UJkeEHM,18981200,18987520,the sixers where they're like on this  like six year plan where it's like  whereas like the rockets are like ah
KNl9UJkeEHM,18987520,18994878,three years we might be back in the hunt  right you compare okc  okc's rebuild which started earlier than
KNl9UJkeEHM,18994878,19001520,houston's and you compared that to the  rockets rebuild and it looks like the  rockets are further along the stronger
KNl9UJkeEHM,19001520,19008000,rebuild thus far and they're doing it  quicker i mean look i like sga i like uh  dort and a couple other players sga is
KNl9UJkeEHM,19008000,19014718,awesome we'll see how the rest of this  court comes together so the lakers on  the clock here and by the way we have a
KNl9UJkeEHM,19014718,19020560,lakers youtube channel it's youtube.com  slash lakers tv if you want to subscribe
KNl9UJkeEHM,19020560,19026080,to our lakers channel be sure to go  ahead and do that youtube.com lakers tv
KNl9UJkeEHM,19026080,19033440,they bought this pic earlier from  orlando will about 10 hours ago earlier  in the day so clearly the lakers had
KNl9UJkeEHM,19033440,19039040,their eyes on somebody trevor kills  anybody i i think you know it's funny  when
KNl9UJkeEHM,19039040,19045040,when they traded into the second round  keels is one of the guys i thought they  might have been going after christian
KNl9UJkeEHM,19045040,19051120,brown as well but brown went 21st  overall  to denver uh i don't know i mean max
KNl9UJkeEHM,19051120,19056240,christie's still on the board a pretty  talented shooting guard out at michigan  state you know they could maybe use some
KNl9UJkeEHM,19056240,19063760,shooters so it's gonna be interesting to  see what they do yeah and that's the  pick here it's it is gonna be christy  which is uh interesting one and done guy
KNl9UJkeEHM,19063760,19069120,uh for the spartans uh  six five almost six six has good size
KNl9UJkeEHM,19069120,19074878,there didn't shoot the ball that well  from three but 82 and a half free throw
KNl9UJkeEHM,19074878,19081680,uh per uh shooter  in terms of percentage 82 and a half  percent so  that's signs of a guy who can improve
KNl9UJkeEHM,19081680,19088718,his jump shot from the outside uh just  over nine points per game three and a  half rebounds one and a half assists you
KNl9UJkeEHM,19088718,19094958,wonder if this is a guy they were just  eyeing and they felt comfortable that  they'd be able to get him at 35 he lands
KNl9UJkeEHM,19094958,19101280,the lakers you look at the composite  ranking 33 overall they get them at 35  so about the proper range for him early
KNl9UJkeEHM,19101280,19106798,in the second round there's a lot of  people that thought he was gonna go  first round instead he goes uh to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,19106798,19112400,lake show at 35 overall the lakers did  not have a pick in the draft this
KNl9UJkeEHM,19112400,19117600,morning they go with christy here and uh  yeah i don't know uh you know like you
KNl9UJkeEHM,19117600,19123440,said the numbers were i mean nothing  like too crazy starts to improve a  little bit as a three-point shooter but
KNl9UJkeEHM,19123440,19129840,uh you know you can certainly develop in  l.a yeah certainly a guy that uh they  think has a high ceiling and projects to
KNl9UJkeEHM,19129840,19135760,to have that potential will the lakers  be back in the playoffs next year they  better will otherwise you're just
KNl9UJkeEHM,19135760,19142000,wasting lebron's uh you know last year  kind of enters the twilight final year  of his uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,19142000,19149360,contract with the lakers if they missed  the playoffs you gotta think he'd  probably be looking for a new  opportunity type y for yes type in for
KNl9UJkeEHM,19149360,19155440,no will the lakers be back i think they  probably will be i just can't see a  lebron team missing the playoffs two
KNl9UJkeEHM,19155440,19160638,years in a row darving ham was a hell of  a higher yeah i like that move i do i do  like that move they got to find a way to
KNl9UJkeEHM,19160638,19166958,get rid of ross that's what i think but  i think they bring in a kyrie that's  looking more i'm not a kyrie guy but if
KNl9UJkeEHM,19166958,19172798,you if if that's what gets rid of ross i  i would do it  i would absolutely russ and katie
KNl9UJkeEHM,19172798,19179360,reunited in brooklyn no way  you had to be a third team involved  durant will not play with russ again
KNl9UJkeEHM,19179360,19185360,there's no way that will happen uh but  that would be they they make a movie  about that if they want to title
KNl9UJkeEHM,19185360,19192400,together in brooklyn yeah get the white  30 for 30 ready if that happens jerry  ronnie joe all saying no chucky a lot of
KNl9UJkeEHM,19192400,19198480,no's in the chat they don't think the  lake show's making the playoffs so  we'll see what happens all right
KNl9UJkeEHM,19198480,19204958,if you like the pick like the video hell  if you don't like the pick then like the  video come on let's get to 8 000 likes
KNl9UJkeEHM,19204958,19212000,then we can say mr soto's first name  again  uh we can't say mr soto's first name
KNl9UJkeEHM,19212000,19219440,until we get to 8 000 likes we need 636  more  that's the deal we can't say k-a-i
KNl9UJkeEHM,19219440,19225280,that's uh that's the deal we made so  even if he gets drafted we can't say the  name i know and so we're going to like
KNl9UJkeEHM,19225280,19231200,the video it'll also you know don't jinx  it if you like the video he might get  true if you like mr soto like the video
KNl9UJkeEHM,19231200,19238160,i mean that that's what this comes down  to so hit that thumbs up icon we're  already at 74.80 now we're just over 500
KNl9UJkeEHM,19238160,19244878,likes away appreciate that christopher  says hell no well you know then that's  that's that's your business luke with
KNl9UJkeEHM,19244878,19250160,the five dollar uh super appreciate that  my friend the grizzlies have been  killing this draft in my opinion do you
KNl9UJkeEHM,19250160,19255360,think we can make a run  i mean they were great last year right i  mean this team won 56 games in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,19255360,19261760,western conference which we know is an  absolute beating i made this analogy  earlier will and i'm not saying memphis
KNl9UJkeEHM,19261760,19268160,is going to do what golden state has  done but i kind of feel like they're in  a similar place to where they were or
KNl9UJkeEHM,19268160,19273200,when the warriors were with mark jackson  where like they broke through this year  they want to play off series they were
KNl9UJkeEHM,19273200,19279760,forced to be reckoned with can they take  that next step now can they be a team  that's consistently winning 50-plus
KNl9UJkeEHM,19279760,19285120,games and making runs to the western  conference finals it's tough in the west  but i think they got the nucleus to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,19285120,19290878,able to potentially do that think about  how tough the west is and how young that  team is and they were the two seed in
KNl9UJkeEHM,19290878,19297360,the west so absolutely they can take  that next step and john morant is a  superstar they're gonna have him
KNl9UJkeEHM,19297360,19303520,uh long term i i would expect them to to  lock that guy up so uh they're  definitely gonna be a force to be
KNl9UJkeEHM,19303520,19309840,reckoned with even with the west being  tough they probably need to add someone  in free agency to you know help ja out a
KNl9UJkeEHM,19309840,19316160,little bit but walker kessler man was a  great pick  yeah  i don't even know how to say that he no
KNl9UJkeEHM,19316160,19323280,go go  we want kyle i almost said it  oh it did you you can't i said so what
KNl9UJkeEHM,19323280,19330798,happens if we say it what happens oh  it's a shot did i say it  you guys have the official ruling
KNl9UJkeEHM,19330798,19338558,all right it's a shot i think you said  so uh they want soto will i'll take do  you think he gets drafted
KNl9UJkeEHM,19338558,19345200,i do  i do who takes him i think i think uh  cheers if the celtics don't take beau
KNl9UJkeEHM,19345200,19350400,cruz 53 i think they're i and kai soto  you want that to happen so bad
KNl9UJkeEHM,19350400,19355920,oh i absolutely do i mean he's the host  of celtics today and by the way go and  subscribe
KNl9UJkeEHM,19355920,19363080,to celtics today on youtube uh that  would be unbelievable so i'm all for it

KNl9UJkeEHM,19468000,19474958,are you surprised that dallas is trading  into the second round no there was a  rumor yesterday that they could do that
KNl9UJkeEHM,19474958,19481120,they liked trevor keels it sounds like i  think they're surprised that hardy's  sitting there to be honest with you like
KNl9UJkeEHM,19481120,19487120,wow okay let's make a move and they're  not moving any players to do it two  future seconds i'd do that in a
KNl9UJkeEHM,19487120,19494000,heartbeat absolutely uh to get jaden  hardy a first round talent who again all  these g-league guys the shooting splits
KNl9UJkeEHM,19494000,19501600,it's hard to know what to take away from  them because it's not super organized  basketball but a huge recruit that opts
KNl9UJkeEHM,19501600,19508160,to go to the g league 6-4 almost 200  pounds  i gotta say i i love this pick uh for
KNl9UJkeEHM,19508160,19513760,the mavs the guy on the composite board  23rd overall you get him at 37. nico

KNl9UJkeEHM,19525440,19530798,hardy  hey this has been a good one third  overall prospect that we had and he goes

KNl9UJkeEHM,19735520,19742480,here at chad sports so marsh in your  opinion what is what has been the best  pick up tonight i like the shade and
KNl9UJkeEHM,19742480,19747520,sharp pick i mean he's probably the  biggest wild card in the draft probably  the coolest story in my opinion he goes
KNl9UJkeEHM,19747520,19753360,from unranked to being the number one  ranked player in the country foregoes  his senior season doesn't play at
KNl9UJkeEHM,19753360,19758558,kentucky this past year and ends up  being a top 10 pick in the nba draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,19758558,19763680,let's talk a little bit more about shade  and sharp he opted to sit out of his  loan season at kentucky in preparation
KNl9UJkeEHM,19763680,19769680,for the draft he's a great shooter with  the athleticism to finish above the rim  he obviously will need to have better
KNl9UJkeEHM,19769680,19775440,shot selection in the nba but overall  this is a do-it-all player and i think  this is the type of player that people
KNl9UJkeEHM,19775440,19782160,are looking for in the nba that can get  it done scored all three levels he's  uber athletic and he's shown athleticism
KNl9UJkeEHM,19782160,19787840,to where he can be a good defender i'm a  big fan of shade and sharp and i think  the sky is the limit for the kid kind of
KNl9UJkeEHM,19787840,19793200,the unknown  is always intriguing we didn't see him  in college the last time we saw him play
KNl9UJkeEHM,19793200,19800558,was his junior year of high school so i  think it's interesting he goes and he's  now a top 10 pick i think him alongside
KNl9UJkeEHM,19800558,19806160,dame willard and they also just got  uh i'm blanking on the name detroit
KNl9UJkeEHM,19806160,19812400,pistons jeremy grant as well yes i like  what the  portland sheriff waiters got cooking  right now i think they could be
KNl9UJkeEHM,19812400,19819600,competing in the western conference this  year for sure game time is back i'm  excited marsh i said the name that could
KNl9UJkeEHM,19819600,19826400,not be named twice when i was giving  shout outs so that means two shots for  me what can we not say oh we cannot say
KNl9UJkeEHM,19826400,19832240,mr soto's first name i thought you would  fall i will take it again  i will take a shot as you break down
KNl9UJkeEHM,19832240,19838480,this next pick let's do it kennedy  chandler selected by the memphis  grizzlies with the 38th pick in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,19838480,19845120,draft  19 years old spurs pick traded to  memphis excuse me six foot one and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,19845120,19850878,half inch 172 pounds this past year  averaged 14 points per game he's a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,19850878,19856000,player a little bit an undersized point  guard but he makes up for it with  excellent speed and that's what you want
KNl9UJkeEHM,19856000,19861360,at the point guard spot if you're a  little undersized you want a guy that's  extremely athletic and he can push the
KNl9UJkeEHM,19861360,19867040,tempo he's electric in the open break  he's good on the fast break he gets his  other teammates involved i like how he
KNl9UJkeEHM,19867040,19873760,runs the offense like a vet he doesn't  to turn over the the basketball a lot  he's very selective with the moves that
KNl9UJkeEHM,19873760,19878878,he makes and at the end that he's just a  floor general a little bit of a streaky  shooter with question marks on his
KNl9UJkeEHM,19878878,19884878,upside as a score but i like him in the  second round you're looking for people  that just can contribute and the fact
KNl9UJkeEHM,19884878,19890798,he's the number seven guard in the draft  and you got him in the second round i'm  a big fan of the pick but let me know i
KNl9UJkeEHM,19890798,19899840,want you guys to go down in the comments  section engrade the pic for me get out  your red pen don't be easy be hard a b c
KNl9UJkeEHM,19899840,19906558,d or f because his mom he's giving it an  a so be realistic grade the pick in the  comments section we'll give some shout
KNl9UJkeEHM,19906558,19912240,outs to people willie if you want to do  that right now yeah for sure and uh i  would give the pick an a i've been
KNl9UJkeEHM,19912240,19918638,saying the last 10 picks someone's got  to take this guy a great fit in memphis  jason chu giving it a c alex hall giving
KNl9UJkeEHM,19918638,19926320,an a actually agree alex  let's see penguin big giving an a as  well dustin jennings giving it a b
KNl9UJkeEHM,19926320,19933520,we got  happy jet giving an a we got brandon  giving it a b a lot of a's a lot of b's
KNl9UJkeEHM,19933520,19938958,i will say this with tyus jones on the  free agency market they're gonna they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,19938958,19946240,gonna they're gonna have to replace them  i don't i'm  yes since the spurs traded to memphis  yes tyus jones is a free agent doesn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,19946240,19952558,sound like he's gonna come back to  memphis we know john moran missed like  20 plus games this past year and the  grizzlies played really good when he
KNl9UJkeEHM,19952558,19957840,wasn't on the court picture mike when  you can will because it looks pretty  funny but tyus jones he was a great
KNl9UJkeEHM,19957840,19964160,backup point guard and now hopefully  this guy can come in and take that  position now he's taking that other shot
KNl9UJkeEHM,19964160,19971680,be careful marsh don't say mr soto's  first name  we need we need 200 more likes if you
KNl9UJkeEHM,19971680,19977200,haven't liked this video please do that  protect marsh and i from the from the
KNl9UJkeEHM,19977200,19983600,shot danger zone uh we need 200 more  likes if you're a mr soto fan go give us
KNl9UJkeEHM,19983600,19990400,a like on this video also grade the pick  of kennedy chandler you know he is a guy  when you watch him uh marshall who is a
KNl9UJkeEHM,19990400,19997200,hustle player yes and what is memphis  about grind grind grind city they love
KNl9UJkeEHM,19997200,20002558,hustle guys in memphis it's a great pick  i'm surprised he fell this far i like it  let's recap a little bit of the couple
KNl9UJkeEHM,20002558,20008160,of picks that were recently made ty ty  washington goes to your houston rockets
KNl9UJkeEHM,20008160,20014080,was talked about as a lottery pick dude  he fell down but he was a first round  selection he's going to houston then
KNl9UJkeEHM,20014080,20019600,peyton watson goes 30th overall to the  detroit uh to the denver nuggets excuse
KNl9UJkeEHM,20019600,20025840,me andrew nembard goes to the indiana  pacers and caleb houston goes to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,20025840,20031280,orlando magic with the 30-second pick in  the nba draft  man i'll tell you what that tai tai
KNl9UJkeEHM,20031280,20036878,washington pick might be the best value  pick of this entire draft he's a top 15
KNl9UJkeEHM,20036878,20042480,prospect falls to houston 29 they  weren't even supposed to have that pick  they traded back and still got a player
KNl9UJkeEHM,20042480,20048638,of washington's caliber houston has  crushed this draft yeah i like tai tai i  think he's a good scorer i like to see  him be a little bit more of a ford
KNl9UJkeEHM,20048638,20054400,general and an actual true point guard  but he's a bucket getter for sure of  these four picks on screen will who is
KNl9UJkeEHM,20054400,20060160,your favorite of these guys on screen um  man probably probably christian koloko
KNl9UJkeEHM,20060160,20065760,and uh i said this to harry before he  hopped on i think koloko is going to be  a borderline all-star at some point in
KNl9UJkeEHM,20065760,20071600,his career i think he's going to be that  good and toronto's known for developing  players drafting really solid and then
KNl9UJkeEHM,20071600,20079120,they take one of the best big men in  this draft at 33rd overall yeah and then  jalen hardy goes number 37 overall to
KNl9UJkeEHM,20079120,20085200,the dallas mavericks they trade up into  the second round get the wing out of the  g league played for the ignite last
KNl9UJkeEHM,20085200,20090798,season he's going to be able to add some  good defense and versatility to the mavs  this season they needed to get back in
KNl9UJkeEHM,20090798,20096480,this draft add some youth they made a  big trade for christian wood lost some  depth so i like the fact that they get
KNl9UJkeEHM,20096480,20104080,back in the draft they had a guy that's  going to be cost controlled for the next  couple of years and then kennedy  chandler goes to the memphis grizzlies
KNl9UJkeEHM,20104080,20109440,we're both big fans of him yeah and now  the cleveland cavaliers are on the clock  so we'll see what happens here we'll

KNl9UJkeEHM,20264320,20271040,who has a capable ball handler at the  big size solid mobility for a big man  has the upside to eventually develop
KNl9UJkeEHM,20271040,20276558,into a strong rim protector he's a raw  prospects  raw prospect that lacks shooting range
KNl9UJkeEHM,20276558,20282716,but at the end of the day everybody you  select in the second round is going to  be a little bit raw

KNl9UJkeEHM,20323440,20329040,better ej liddell going to the new  orleans pelicans at 41. item going 18
KNl9UJkeEHM,20329040,20334240,overall to the chicago bulls a lot of  teams had him going in the first round  now
KNl9UJkeEHM,20334240,20339760,i think this guy is going to be one of  the big sleepers of this draft class i
KNl9UJkeEHM,20339760,20346878,love how he went back to ohio state and  proved his game in all facets 19 and a  half points per game eight rebounds last
KNl9UJkeEHM,20346878,20353440,year knocked down about 37 percent of  his threes more than two blocks per game  as well which is really impressive
KNl9UJkeEHM,20353440,20359840,considering that size at six seven  because he's not the tallest guy  belleville illinois a sweet spot in an
KNl9UJkeEHM,20359840,20365600,underrated region for some really good  nba prospects ayo dusumu coming from
KNl9UJkeEHM,20365600,20371680,illinois he played a lot against ej  liddell who is from belleville uh io
KNl9UJkeEHM,20371680,20378718,dasumi went to morgan park a basketball  powerhouse out of chicago and these two  played a lot on the aau and high school
KNl9UJkeEHM,20378718,20384958,circuit so you look at some of the  recent picks that have happened here the  mavericks trade for a second round pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,20384958,20391360,and they get a cam thomas type of score  and jaden hardy his efficiency is  certainly a problem but they need some
KNl9UJkeEHM,20391360,20396718,scoring spunk off the bench he goes to  dallas at 37 kennedy chandler a tyrese
KNl9UJkeEHM,20396718,20403280,maxi clone to the grizzlies at 38 guard  out of tennessee khalifa diop the big
KNl9UJkeEHM,20403280,20411840,from overseas to the cavs at number 39  then bryce mcgowan's at number 40 then  ej liddell as we just talked about pinzo
KNl9UJkeEHM,20411840,20419840,back in the chat what'd it do holmes  lakers will have to or else no one will  watch the playoffs lebron is the show
KNl9UJkeEHM,20419840,20425840,see that's technically false because up  until the nba finals  nba playoff ratings on television were
KNl9UJkeEHM,20425840,20431040,really good with no lebron james and i  thought the product was really good  j lula
KNl9UJkeEHM,20431040,20438320,the tank is officially over he's not  talking about jack lottery he's talking  about the okc tank let's go
KNl9UJkeEHM,20438320,20443920,so uh yeah it looks as though the tank  for okc is in fact over it's time for
KNl9UJkeEHM,20443920,20450160,them to try to start winning basketball  yeah they they've done some really good  things collect picks every single year  you got to do something with the picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,20450160,20455280,and it seems like sam presti is ready to  put this thing in drive and make it  happen according to tim mcmahon jaden
KNl9UJkeEHM,20455280,20461040,hardy was the 19th player on the  mavericks draft board they got him at 30  seconds that's a steal two dollar super
KNl9UJkeEHM,20461040,20466558,chat from luke what up luke from  tennessee to memphis let's go kennedy  chandler i like the player he literally
KNl9UJkeEHM,20466558,20472080,reminds me of tyreese maxie with the  twirling around the rim and his play
KNl9UJkeEHM,20472080,20477440,making off the bounce  vamp with the two-piece i will  unsubscribe if you don't draft kai
KNl9UJkeEHM,20477440,20484798,settle here's the thing it's not up to  me to draft kai soto so i'm not running  these nba front offices we do appreciate
KNl9UJkeEHM,20484798,20491600,you subscribing hopefully you stay with  us because we cook up content year round  so all those super chats coming in i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,20491600,20498080,give you cheers for that my new york  knicks are on the clock  the pick is in the new york knicks have
KNl9UJkeEHM,20498080,20504160,selected trevor keels at pick number 42.  trey uh chase tell me what you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,20504160,20510320,about trevor keels out of duke  uh really good  wing slash guard
KNl9UJkeEHM,20510320,20516400,18 years old so he's still really young  he's actually one of the younger  prospects in this class six four
KNl9UJkeEHM,20516400,20522080,had a lot of the ball handling  responsibilities for duke last year for  a team that honestly probably should
KNl9UJkeEHM,20522080,20528798,have won the national championship a  battering ram going to the hoop with  really strong playmaking skills needs to
KNl9UJkeEHM,20528798,20537840,improve a shooting consistency why is  that from distance last year  31 from three on 173 three-point
KNl9UJkeEHM,20537840,20544558,attempts he is a seasoned passer though  he can be a backup point guard for new  york you have to think marsh i imagine
KNl9UJkeEHM,20544558,20551040,emmanuel quickly will assume those point  guard responsibilities maybe it's trevor  keels as the backup there yeah so it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,20551040,20558240,definitely going to be interesting for  the knicks everything we've seen today  in the nba draft is that they are  preparing for the nba for agency they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,20558240,20564160,clearing cap space they want to go all  in on jalen brunson so they had another  guard to come off the bench and keels so
KNl9UJkeEHM,20564160,20571760,now you got miles mcbride emanuel  quickly derrick rose and potentially  jalen brunson manning the backcourt for
KNl9UJkeEHM,20571760,20578958,the blue and orange and for the 2022 and  2023 season and going forward but let me  know was this a good pick by the new
KNl9UJkeEHM,20578958,20584080,york knickerbockers type g for good type  t type b for bad honestly i would have
KNl9UJkeEHM,20584080,20589680,liked to gone more after a wing that can  shoot it i think one of the biggest  problems the knicks had this past year
KNl9UJkeEHM,20589680,20595200,was the lack of shooting on the  perimeter especially at the two and  three spot but hey it's the second round
KNl9UJkeEHM,20595200,20600958,maybe they had keels pretty rated  highway on their draft board and they  pulled the trigger but let me know type
KNl9UJkeEHM,20600958,20606878,g if you think it was a good pick for  the knicks or type b if you think it was  a bad pick for the new york knicks
KNl9UJkeEHM,20606878,20613440,what's cool marsh this guy's got an  incredible body type he has six three  and 224 pounds
KNl9UJkeEHM,20613440,20621040,so the battering ram type deal he has  that football player  wide shoulders strong upper body this
KNl9UJkeEHM,20621040,20628000,guy is a tank you see him on the floor  he's one of those guys you see in person  you're like  what do you do are you a bodyguard are
KNl9UJkeEHM,20628000,20633280,you a defensive event no i'm a point  guard two guards so he's going to the  new york knicks i think they're gonna
KNl9UJkeEHM,20633280,20639120,really like this guy so be sure to get  those votes in g for good b for bad
KNl9UJkeEHM,20639120,20645680,marshall's next video that's on the  channel  it's as hot as the last couple of weeks  in dallas and we have had record
KNl9UJkeEHM,20645680,20652240,breaking temperatures it had a lot of  views if you want to get some nba draft  hats they're available right now by

KNl9UJkeEHM,20674240,20680558,nba draft hats get yours today thanks to  our friends at fanatics so trevor keels
KNl9UJkeEHM,20680558,20685760,goes to the knicks the pick at number 43  is in for the los angeles clippers they
KNl9UJkeEHM,20685760,20692240,are going with musa diabetes out of  michigan 20 years old 6 10. he's only
KNl9UJkeEHM,20692240,20698798,217 pounds this guy is wiry this guy is  extremely long and athletic
KNl9UJkeEHM,20698798,20704080,cool sam multi-positional defender who  uses his length to his advantage solid
KNl9UJkeEHM,20704080,20711040,screener and finisher in the pick and  roll unproven shooter who even struggled  in the mid-range game but what's good
KNl9UJkeEHM,20711040,20716958,about him and his stroke is that he can  get his shots off from really anywhere  on the floor because of that length and
KNl9UJkeEHM,20716958,20723040,that athleticism so marsh obviously the  clippers are in a spot where maybe they  go after kyrie but right now they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,20723040,20728320,kind of set with  paul george kawhi leonard reggie jackson
KNl9UJkeEHM,20728320,20733680,terence mann uh markeith morris like  that team is pretty good i imagine he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,20733680,20739520,going to spend a lot of time at the g  league level yeah second round pick this  is someone that's going to take a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,20739520,20744798,while to you know find his groove in the  nba especially on a team like the  clippers that's loaded with veterans
KNl9UJkeEHM,20744798,20751440,like all the guys you rattled off so  diabote could be a pick for the future i  don't see him contributing too much
KNl9UJkeEHM,20751440,20756958,early on in his nba career i think he'll  be more of a backup or g-league guy like  you said look when you got paul george
KNl9UJkeEHM,20756958,20762240,and kawhi leonard and one of the morris  twins ahead of you it's gonna be tough  to find minutes and crack that rotation
KNl9UJkeEHM,20762240,20767760,but hey hustle effort be able to hit the  three might be able to find some time  this year yeah really good on ball
KNl9UJkeEHM,20767760,20773680,defense too and obviously 610 with that  wingspan with that length
KNl9UJkeEHM,20773680,20779120,you gotta have an idea of what kind of  defender he can be like a harry giles
KNl9UJkeEHM,20779120,20784798,type of guy okay but i actually think he  might have more i'm sorry  and and look he coming out of high
KNl9UJkeEHM,20784798,20790320,school he was a dog he was a dog and he  was looked at as the number one prospect  and then he suffered some injuries i
KNl9UJkeEHM,20790320,20795440,love his awareness  yeah okay shout out your favorite squad
KNl9UJkeEHM,20795440,20800718,and uh marshall looked down and the  first one that he sees in just a couple
KNl9UJkeEHM,20800718,20807120,of moments we're gonna talk about so who  is your favorite squad let us know in  the comment section and the first one
KNl9UJkeEHM,20807120,20812878,that marshall sees in 10 seconds we'll  talk about so 10  9 8
KNl9UJkeEHM,20812878,20819200,7 6 5  4 3  2 1.
KNl9UJkeEHM,20819200,20825760,warriors let's talk about the warriors  interestingly enough  they have selected ryan rollins the
KNl9UJkeEHM,20825760,20831840,guard out of toledo  this is a really intriguing prospect and  this is a guy who some people had
KNl9UJkeEHM,20831840,20840000,expected to go in the 30s of the first  round he slides back to the warriors at  number 44 and this is back-to-back
KNl9UJkeEHM,20840000,20848160,picks that i really like from golden  state they go after  um patrick baldwin at pick number 28 and
KNl9UJkeEHM,20848160,20854718,now they go with ryan rollins potential  high upside guy has the ability to score  from all three levels does play with
KNl9UJkeEHM,20854718,20861440,pace that's exactly what the warriors  like to do showed some improvement as a  playmaker lacked strength in athleticism
KNl9UJkeEHM,20861440,20866798,which is most evident on defense he gets  beat and beat up one on one but look
KNl9UJkeEHM,20866798,20872638,when you're playing guard at toledo  you're not going up against the best  level of competition here so it's going
KNl9UJkeEHM,20872638,20879440,to be a big step up for rollins and this  is another player like a lot of these  second-round guys who will probably play
KNl9UJkeEHM,20879440,20886160,a lot at the g-league level in santa  cruz with the warriors for sure and  especially when you're going to a  championship team like the golden state
KNl9UJkeEHM,20886160,20891680,warriors who already had a lot of young  guys on their roster that weren't  playing this past year are now going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,20891680,20897920,be looking for minutes i saw  bob myers say that guys like kaminga and  the people they drafted last year are
KNl9UJkeEHM,20897920,20903440,going to have to earn their minutes in  their sophomore season so for guys like  patrick baldwin and ryan rollins they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,20903440,20908958,going to be looking to just make this  team and not have to go to the g but hey  with the way the g league is shaken up
KNl9UJkeEHM,20908958,20915280,and there's more emphasis and there's  more you know assets and resources  placed on the g league going to the g
KNl9UJkeEHM,20915280,20920320,league is not not a bad thing like it  used to be a couple of years ago no it  gives an opportunity to young players
KNl9UJkeEHM,20920320,20925920,like these guys to get reps play  basketball because at the end of the day  you only get better when you're playing
KNl9UJkeEHM,20925920,20933280,you don't get better watching on the  bench  okay another sleeper here i was looking  at john hollinger's big board and he had
KNl9UJkeEHM,20933280,20938320,josh minnow  at number 10.  now a lot of people didn't expect him to
KNl9UJkeEHM,20938320,20943920,go until the second round this is about  the spot where a lot of people had  expected him to go as for what hollinger
KNl9UJkeEHM,20943920,20949280,said about him fascinating cat six eight  freshman small forward and power forward
KNl9UJkeEHM,20949280,20954718,so positional versatility  jalen duren and amani bates got all the
KNl9UJkeEHM,20954718,20960878,attention playing for penny hardaway at  memphis but  josh was a pretty solid player he saw
KNl9UJkeEHM,20960878,20967600,his role fluctuate he was hardly playing  by the end of the year not a good  shooter two of 14 on threes this past
KNl9UJkeEHM,20967600,20973840,year will be 19 and a half on draft day  so he's still really young and a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,20973840,20979200,bit old for a freshman but a young  player overall but when you look at the  analytics they're really impressive for
KNl9UJkeEHM,20979200,20985280,him sky high steel rate for a big  forward three and a half per 100  possessions that's really good a
KNl9UJkeEHM,20985280,20991280,positive assist to turnover rate and a  rebound percentage of more than 14. so
KNl9UJkeEHM,20991280,20998320,this guy is is a is an impact player  when it comes down to him just being an  all-around dude 75 and a half percent
KNl9UJkeEHM,20998320,21003360,from the line so he may have struggled  from three but at least he can knock  down some free throws and won't be too
KNl9UJkeEHM,21003360,21009840,much of a liability yeah we're watching  some highlights right here i've seen a  couple plays where he attacks the  offensive glass and finishes with
KNl9UJkeEHM,21009840,21015840,putbacks around the rim you're looking  for those long lanky dudes that are  athletic freaks and to go to minnesota a
KNl9UJkeEHM,21015840,21022240,team that's on the rise got a lot of  young stars and cat and anthony edwards  it's another tool in the toolbox for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,21022240,21027760,t wolves to use for the coming future  yeah so they get another young player on  the roster
KNl9UJkeEHM,21027760,21033840,and for the  for the timberwolves they're entering  pretty interesting era uh you have
KNl9UJkeEHM,21033840,21039120,anthony edwards you have carl anthony  towns we'll see what happens with  d'angelo russell they made a pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,21039120,21046000,earlier tonight if we want to recap what  minnesota has been able to do jack we  can decide to do that but this is a team
KNl9UJkeEHM,21046000,21051680,that in the first round  if they didn't play such dumb basketball  and careless basketball against memphis
KNl9UJkeEHM,21051680,21056718,they could have won that first round  series and that would have been a  monumental jump for such a young team
KNl9UJkeEHM,21056718,21064320,that is blossoming at the right time as  for what the t wolves have done  22nd overall walker kessler who had
KNl9UJkeEHM,21064320,21070798,nearly five blocks per game last year  with auburn then they go wendell moore a  little bit of a surprise reach at number
KNl9UJkeEHM,21070798,21078160,26 but duke had so many good players  last year he was one of them and that's  josh minow uh out of memphis going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,21078160,21084840,the t-wolves at number 45. we want to  help marshall get the uh 1500 twitter

KNl9UJkeEHM,21271920,21278638,can finish in the interior and can  certainly get creative with his ability  to finish around the tin strong shot
KNl9UJkeEHM,21278638,21284400,blocker with quick leaping ability  looking at some of the international  clips
KNl9UJkeEHM,21284400,21290878,kind of reminds me a little bit of clint  capela like he does have that little  two-man aspect to his game and can
KNl9UJkeEHM,21290878,21296240,certainly sky for some blocks number  five overall big in this class and 41
KNl9UJkeEHM,21296240,21303920,overall prospects so he goes about where  he should have  round to 46 to the denver nuggets which
KNl9UJkeEHM,21303920,21310320,is actually i think the detroit pistons  but the pistons traded it to the nuggets  there's been so much movement all

KNl9UJkeEHM,21618558,21625360,houston rockets i think at this point  it's proven russell westbrook is not a  winning basketball player he doesn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,21625360,21631920,play a winning brand or a winning style  a game too many bad shots too many  turnovers a lot of highlights but at the

KNl9UJkeEHM,21700718,21706958,length to stifle smaller players has  certainly shown flashes of developing  his shot but he's not there yet as i
KNl9UJkeEHM,21706958,21712080,talked about isaiah mobley out of usc  does he look familiar that's because his
KNl9UJkeEHM,21712080,21717680,brother evan mobley looks just like him  and got drafted in the top three last
KNl9UJkeEHM,21717680,21723600,year by the cleveland cavaliers he's  going to the cavaliers to team up with  his brother so the mobley brothers going

KNl9UJkeEHM,21743120,21749280,drafted last year he goes back to school  and had a pretty solid season but he is  not the player that his you just have to

KNl9UJkeEHM,22537440,22543760,people are certainly supporting the  movement at chase underscore senior as  we're about to welcome on back to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,22543760,22549600,program  harrison graham i can't wait to talk to  him about jayden hardy i think that
KNl9UJkeEHM,22549600,22557280,video is going to really do well  jaden hardy solid player another pick to  get to yanique and zoza
KNl9UJkeEHM,22557280,22564718,overtime  or uh overseas big excuse me how about  this man he is so so raw
KNl9UJkeEHM,22564718,22571360,but at 610 195 pounds he is only 18  years old is this a bobon marianovich
KNl9UJkeEHM,22571360,22576958,age thing i don't think so yanique and  zoza a good big from overseas going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,22576958,22582638,the wizards at 54. i imagine him too  being an international prospect he could
KNl9UJkeEHM,22582638,22589600,be a draft and stash as well so that's  pick number 54. only 58 picks we'll see
KNl9UJkeEHM,22589600,22596240,if kai soto gets selected over the next  four  as for
KNl9UJkeEHM,22596638,22601680,let's see sam what are you pointing at  uh warriors did send the 55th overall
KNl9UJkeEHM,22601680,22607840,pick  to milwaukee  they did make another pick though uh  ryan rollins right so
KNl9UJkeEHM,22607840,22613440,they do have two selections  in this draft harrison graham about to
KNl9UJkeEHM,22613440,22620240,come back on to the show  can't wait to chat it up with him once  again we're going to do some bucks talk
KNl9UJkeEHM,22620240,22626080,here uh buck the bucks with pick number  55 here from the golden state warriors
KNl9UJkeEHM,22626080,22632558,after the warriors were at 51 they  traded up to make that selection that we  just talked about uh milwaukee bucks
KNl9UJkeEHM,22632558,22638958,some of their needs here versatile wings  backcourt depth shooters they exercised  the option for pat conaton so he's
KNl9UJkeEHM,22638958,22644558,coming back projected cap space there  you see it 24th in the nba lost to the
KNl9UJkeEHM,22644558,22651520,celtics in the second round of the  playoffs and they're in this win now  mode and when you have giannis  antetokounmpo you have an opportunity to
KNl9UJkeEHM,22651520,22657440,compete for championships they will once  again have an opportunity to compete for  a championship and maybe they could have
KNl9UJkeEHM,22657440,22663760,if chris middleton didn't get hurt  bucks also traded for 58. so
KNl9UJkeEHM,22663760,22670718,a couple of picks and they like  international players could they draft  kai soto  please here's harrison what's up what'd
KNl9UJkeEHM,22670718,22676160,you think about jane hardy man a little  bit of a surprise great value man yeah i  don't i think the mavs were surprised he
KNl9UJkeEHM,22676160,22684240,was there and they're like we got to  make a move uh they sent two future  seconds  um  is it like deep long-term security if
KNl9UJkeEHM,22684240,22690638,brunson goes to the knicks i don't know  uh number four overall player in this  last recruiting cycle so he's got huge
KNl9UJkeEHM,22690638,22697760,potential um i  i love the pick i mean top 25 type of  guy you get him at 37 so
KNl9UJkeEHM,22697760,22703120,i think the value's good um i think two  the two moves nico harrison's made this
KNl9UJkeEHM,22703120,22709440,off season have been good you trade 26  and four deep reserves for christian  wood a guy who's going to start and you
KNl9UJkeEHM,22709440,22715920,get jaden hardy who has starter  potential down the road so i'm pretty  happy with what they've done yeah i like  it too and according to tim mcmahon he
KNl9UJkeEHM,22715920,22722478,was like the 19th player on their  overall big board so they had him as a  first round prospect and they got him
KNl9UJkeEHM,22722478,22727600,pretty deep into the second round think  of it this way if you don't make the  christian wood tray and you peek
KNl9UJkeEHM,22727600,22733200,keep 26 you probably just take them at  26. yeah you might get wood and hardy
KNl9UJkeEHM,22733200,22738240,yeah i know he worked out for the sixers  they had the 23rd overall pick so they  at least thought about it they traded
KNl9UJkeEHM,22738240,22744080,out of that pick but they worked him out  a couple of teams did cam thomas my pro  comp for him because he is a walking
KNl9UJkeEHM,22744080,22750638,bucket he's not scared at all  the efficiency is bad and he is not a  good defensive player at all i wonder
KNl9UJkeEHM,22750638,22755920,what these efficient these geely guys  none of them are efficient like
KNl9UJkeEHM,22755920,22762320,is it a result that there's like no  organization and like the g-league is  like these guys are just trying to
KNl9UJkeEHM,22762320,22768400,get to the nba so they're they're not  you know what i'm saying like you go to  college i'm not saying college you're
KNl9UJkeEHM,22768400,22773600,getting the best development but i think  a lot of these guys with this g-league  route right now they're trying to cash
KNl9UJkeEHM,22773600,22779360,in make some bucks and just score as  many points as possible because none of  these guys have gone the ignite route
KNl9UJkeEHM,22779360,22786240,have been efficient none of them have no  now i will say this  um jonathan kaminga
KNl9UJkeEHM,22786240,22792080,he was with the g-league ignite last  year and i think he's going to end up  being a really good player but the style
KNl9UJkeEHM,22792080,22799760,of basketball isn't good dyson daniels i  think has some potential but they don't  play  equality nba team brand style but my
KNl9UJkeEHM,22799760,22806400,point is is kaminga ended up being a  better shooter than we thought yeah yeah  you know what i'm saying so that could  be the case with hardy people yeah so if
KNl9UJkeEHM,22806400,22813040,you're having a good time hit that  thumbs up icon and like the video  sixteen hundred likes away from ten
KNl9UJkeEHM,22813040,22819280,thousand that would be a pretty awesome  number still kicking with us eight  thousand people watching live as we
KNl9UJkeEHM,22819280,22825200,approach seven hundred thousand viewers  all throughout the night we already beat  last year's record with overall viewers
KNl9UJkeEHM,22825200,22831200,so shout out to everybody for tuning in  we have another super chat coming in  from vamp we'll pop that up on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,22831200,22836878,screen here in just a few moments he is  adamant that we are making the pick for
KNl9UJkeEHM,22836878,22842080,kai soto he wants us to draft kai soto  if we had our choice
KNl9UJkeEHM,22842080,22847840,that'd be great  but yeah for real  we he said chase will you consider
KNl9UJkeEHM,22847840,22853760,drafting kai in the third round there is  no third i wish there was yeah yeah if  there was a third round he might get
KNl9UJkeEHM,22853760,22860478,drafted i think he actually i probably  think he would yeah i think someone  would international stash him if there  was a third round yeah who knows a few
KNl9UJkeEHM,22860478,22867360,picks left you just  never  know uh okay best available chase uh g
KNl9UJkeEHM,22867360,22872478,montero you've got justin lewis hugo  besson jabari walker who stands out of
KNl9UJkeEHM,22872478,22878558,some of the guys who are still hanging  out here gene montero good scorer but he  really doesn't do anything else and
KNl9UJkeEHM,22878558,22885920,that's a problem some of these guys  obviously they're  they're still on the board for a reason  but he's on the board because he just
KNl9UJkeEHM,22885920,22893600,doesn't do much now the composite had  him 34 overall but it's so hard to gauge  these g-league players and i'm wondering
KNl9UJkeEHM,22893600,22900478,if because all these guys are slipping  if they just would have been better  going to college now they secured the  bag they got some money six-figure deals
KNl9UJkeEHM,22900478,22905760,but  if they play in the college ranks i  think  maybe they improve their stock a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,22905760,22911520,bit i mean jayden hardy number four  overall player if he goes to like kansas  and averages 15 a game he's probably a
KNl9UJkeEHM,22911520,22918160,lottery pick i mean  um better coaching i think also with nil  coming into play you know it'll be
KNl9UJkeEHM,22918160,22924478,interesting to see if these guys go to  college or continue to pursue this  g-league route moving forward looks it
KNl9UJkeEHM,22924478,22933958,looks like the warriors still have 55 by  the way  shams tweeted warriors will pick
KNl9UJkeEHM,22934160,22940240,santos i think it's qui qui gui santos  luis santos
KNl9UJkeEHM,22940240,22946320,talked about him on maps well the 55th  pick is gui santos the question is is it  to golden state or milwaukee
KNl9UJkeEHM,22946320,22952558,uh we'll break that down in a second  uh but uh  we'll figure that one out a couple picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,22952558,22958558,here what we will do chase is when the  draft comes to an end you're gonna hop  off get some draft grades together for
KNl9UJkeEHM,22958558,22964080,all 30 nba teams and then uh you're  gonna hop back on after i
KNl9UJkeEHM,22964080,22970958,recap the entire draft uh answer some  questions here in our live q a portion  so that's uh something to look forward

KNl9UJkeEHM,23039840,23046080,son  francine branson's saying kaiser brady  manic from ash i think brady manic
KNl9UJkeEHM,23046080,23052160,should have been drafted should have  been drafted man i don't get i know he's  not a great athlete but he can block  shots and shoot threes like

KNl9UJkeEHM,23064638,23069840,we still don't know what completely  happened at 55 uh we think it's to
KNl9UJkeEHM,23069840,23074958,milwaukee gui santos uh yeah sean's  literally said golden state is set 55 to
KNl9UJkeEHM,23074958,23081680,milwaukee and then he said the world  maybe because technically warriors make  the pick and then it goes to milwaukee
KNl9UJkeEHM,23081680,23088958,what do they have on the broadcast is  the nba they still have warriors so the  pick is in espn's just so far behind uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,23088958,23094160,so can we  stand stay tuned uh six eight he's got  some good size actually pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,23094160,23100400,handle i looked into this guy a little  bit uh talked about him on mavericks  today uh decent score should project as
KNl9UJkeEHM,23100400,23107040,a decent defender this feels like an  international stash  for milwaukee or i guess golden state
KNl9UJkeEHM,23107040,23113120,we'll find out who that pick's going to  uh luke travers out of perth  australia mate
KNl9UJkeEHM,23113120,23119120,good evening drafted  nice there you go shout out to the  aussie homies
KNl9UJkeEHM,23119120,23124878,international basketball over at the nbl  it's really good really good level i  tweeted this out and like picked up some

KNl9UJkeEHM,23136798,23143440,at some point that'd be awesome yeah  it'd be an awesome experience but six  eight 200 pounds has some good size uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,23143440,23150240,we actually don't have numbers for him  uh we'll try to pull those up here but  uh  he lands with uh cleveland here late in
KNl9UJkeEHM,23150240,23155760,the second round so a couple picks here  left to go here who's on the clock at 57
KNl9UJkeEHM,23155760,23163200,do we know and then 58 uh i believe  milwaukee portland on the clock all
KNl9UJkeEHM,23163200,23171200,right chase how about this best pick of  the night  oh wow it's hard to say my gosh uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,23171200,23177520,i love what detroit has done as a whole  love the rocket strap love the rockets  roster i love
KNl9UJkeEHM,23177520,23183760,detroit's roster i think what okc has  done adding just so much length yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,23183760,23188958,it's been really good  um  man
KNl9UJkeEHM,23188958,23196320,best individual i mean the warriors  getting patrick baldwin jr a former  five-star recruit at 28. that's pretty  good value there i honestly don't hate
KNl9UJkeEHM,23196320,23203040,jaden hardy that deep in the second  round the fact that ej liddell fell to  41. that's not that's a big surprise the
KNl9UJkeEHM,23203040,23209760,pelicans okay i was filming that's an  awesome pick that might be my favorite  value pick of the night yeah i think  it's going to be a really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,23209760,23216718,clap by the way  herb jones last year who they got in the  second round second round was a  legitimate 48th or something he was
KNl9UJkeEHM,23216718,23223600,playing 40 minutes in the playoffs yeah  liddell can play as a rookie so i think  that's that's tremendous value for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,23223600,23231840,pelicans ty ty washington that's another  good one the rockets got him what it 28  yeah or 26 29 29 i've been 29 yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,23231840,23237200,that's great value he could have gone  the lottery so  uh a lot of uh a lot of good value picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,23237200,23244958,tonight uh portland's getting a pretty  good one here jabari walker chase sneaks  in here he goes 57 out of colorado he
KNl9UJkeEHM,23244958,23252558,was a guy that was going like early mid  second in some mocks uh he goes 57th  overall here so portland gets a guy that
KNl9UJkeEHM,23252558,23259280,has some upside here late in the draft  yeah six seven sophomore this past year  for colorado just has a nose for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,23259280,23265760,ball  six seven with the 610 wingspan 28 inch  no step vertical so he can certainly get
KNl9UJkeEHM,23265760,23271760,up vertically  and a guy who can just make a couple  things happen and you get this pick this
KNl9UJkeEHM,23271760,23278400,late that is solid value he was slated  to go around this point 14 and a half  points and not the best three-point
KNl9UJkeEHM,23278400,23284478,shooter but almost 35 percent i like the  rebounding chase at six eight nine and a  half boards per game that's really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,23284478,23290638,work for his size um so you know we'll  see there uh how he projects but uh one
KNl9UJkeEHM,23290638,23296160,more pick to go chase 21 of missed shots  in pac-12 games that's pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,23296160,23302478,probably attacks the offensive glass  pretty well who will be the mr  irrelevant  of the nba

KNl9UJkeEHM,24117360,24123680,chat sports we're huge fans of kai soto  here  rogue brother should the clippers have
KNl9UJkeEHM,24123680,24129840,traded up to the first to get ty ty  washington and should they have traded  up to get ishmael kamagadi um you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,24129840,24134958,ty ty fallen to 29 for houston um was a  steal for the rockets uh i i like that
KNl9UJkeEHM,24134958,24142080,quite a bit i do wonder if the clippers  are trying to keep some cat flexibility  they've been linked to kyrie irving as a
KNl9UJkeEHM,24142080,24147200,potential destination for him um so you  know you could say yes because they need
KNl9UJkeEHM,24147200,24154320,some more guards uh but uh i understand  why they did not make that move they  didn't have a lot of capital to go up
KNl9UJkeEHM,24154320,24159760,and get tai tai washington  evan henders bull sign udfa dominic
KNl9UJkeEHM,24159760,24166000,barlow and has to resend levine and  thompson and next we signed mitchell  robinson i i'll focus on uh mitchell
KNl9UJkeEHM,24166000,24172478,robinson here and zach levine  bringing back levine needs to be a  priority for chicago i get he's not the
KNl9UJkeEHM,24172478,24178240,perfect player but you can't let him  walk uh mitchell robinson is a guy that
KNl9UJkeEHM,24178240,24184160,i would be interested in if i was  chicago now i wonder if  you would have to move vuchevich to go
KNl9UJkeEHM,24184160,24191200,get him because robinson's the starting  caliber center and you're not going to  play him and vooch next to each other  but if you can move get it move
KNl9UJkeEHM,24191200,24196400,vooch i should say get off from under  his contract and then robinson comes to
KNl9UJkeEHM,24196400,24203760,town as a defensive anchor and a guy who  can score a little bit as well i'd be  very open to that idea
KNl9UJkeEHM,24204000,24211360,burner kingdom chance brunt's brunson  leave so the new york knicks during the  draft the maneuvers they made they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,24211360,24218240,clearing cap space they traded kimball  walker they traded down from 11. um  they're making a run at brunson maybe a
KNl9UJkeEHM,24218240,24223440,kyrie irving they're trying to maximize  cap space so keep an eye on them i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,24223440,24228798,say this  jalen brunson will play for one of two  teams next year the dallas mavericks of
KNl9UJkeEHM,24228798,24234240,the new york knicks it will not be  another organization dallas drafted  jaden hardy maybe that's a little
KNl9UJkeEHM,24234240,24241280,insurance if brunson does leave  but uh i still think uh the mavs are the  favorites to keep him uh but if the
KNl9UJkeEHM,24241280,24247920,knicks offer like 30 million a year then  maybe they'll opt to not do that who do  you guys think was the biggest winner of
KNl9UJkeEHM,24247920,24253120,the nba draft let us know down in the  comment section the biggest winner of
KNl9UJkeEHM,24253120,24261600,this year's draft let me know what you  guys think down in the comments right  now biggest winner of the 2022 draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,24261600,24268478,mark jacob duvall  mavs trade tim hardaway jaylen brunson  frankena josh green jayden hardy and a
KNl9UJkeEHM,24268478,24274320,future first round pick for zach levine  i don't think i'd want to give up that
KNl9UJkeEHM,24274320,24279360,much and i like levine a lot but i mean  you're giving up tim
KNl9UJkeEHM,24279360,24284478,and brunson who are two heavy rotation  players a future first a guy in jayden
KNl9UJkeEHM,24284478,24289680,hardy who is a first round caliber  player and frankena and josh green who  are a rotation player so you're giving
KNl9UJkeEHM,24289680,24294798,up six pieces that can at least  contribute for levine i like levine
KNl9UJkeEHM,24294798,24301120,that's a lot though  okay lemuel corpus what are the best  trades that happened during
KNl9UJkeEHM,24301120,24309600,i think he meant draft night  um i like dallas moving to future first  to go get jayden hardy at 37. um
KNl9UJkeEHM,24309600,24316240,what are some notable ones that rockets  move down to still get ty ty washington  at 29 is pretty impressive i like that
KNl9UJkeEHM,24316240,24322400,move um  you know  there wasn't a lot of blockbuster draft  trades there really wasn't now
KNl9UJkeEHM,24322400,24328878,technically the christian wood trade  didn't take pla didn't become official  until draft night but dallas uh you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,24328878,24334558,moves 26 and some players to get  christian wood if you want to count that  one i would say that was a pretty good
KNl9UJkeEHM,24334558,24341040,one for the mavs but  there wasn't a lot of blockbusters  during the actual draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,24341040,24346478,john linus jalen green or kai soto  i mean jalen green's already somewhat
KNl9UJkeEHM,24346478,24353760,proven in the nba so i'd have to arrange  lean jalen green but hey we love kai  soto here at chat sports big kaisoto

KNl9UJkeEHM,24376718,24382878,channel  vamp why would the knicks make all those  moves if they didn't know they were
KNl9UJkeEHM,24382878,24388878,getting brunson  um  listen maybe they know something we
KNl9UJkeEHM,24388878,24393920,don't maybe they have a good feeling but  maybe they're also saying hey if we  don't get bronson we can go after kyrie
KNl9UJkeEHM,24393920,24399440,or maybe kyrie is the target or maybe  they just want cap flexibility  regardless of the scenario it's not like
KNl9UJkeEHM,24399440,24405680,kimball walker is a part of their future  so moving him doesn't hurt  sure trading down from 11 if you don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,24405680,24411120,get brunson or irving and you just fill  out that cap with random pieces sure  that hurts but you also got future
KNl9UJkeEHM,24411120,24417440,firsts in the move um i don't think it's  that big of a risk for the knicks to  clear the space and make a run at one of
KNl9UJkeEHM,24417440,24422958,those two players  wowzer kimball walker landing spy yeah
KNl9UJkeEHM,24422958,24429120,he's gonna get bought out it sounds like  you know i look at a team that
KNl9UJkeEHM,24429120,24435840,is  a competing team that needs a backup  point guard like
KNl9UJkeEHM,24436478,24442240,honestly boston back to boston i don't  hate it  um
KNl9UJkeEHM,24442240,24448320,you know i i know that didn't work out  well but if he's a backup i actually  don't mind it uh producer jack's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,24448320,24454320,celtics fan not a fan of that idea but i  i think i'm not sure if peyton  pritchard's the long like a proven
KNl9UJkeEHM,24454320,24461120,backup point guard option yet uh how  about chicago maybe  you know a team like milwaukee could use
KNl9UJkeEHM,24461120,24467120,a backup point i think those are a few  teams that could make some sense now if  you want some draft hats you can wear

KNl9UJkeEHM,24497680,24502878,draft honestly  i like being caro i think they did some  good things tonight but
KNl9UJkeEHM,24502878,24509840,uh i think some other teams did better i  love the rockets draft um i think uh the  thunder had a pretty good night uh but
KNl9UJkeEHM,24509840,24516240,orlando had a good night well as well i  think vancaro is gonna be a solid solid  player
KNl9UJkeEHM,24516240,24522080,wireless kyrie signing with the mavs i  don't carry the way i love the team hey  listen um
KNl9UJkeEHM,24522080,24528400,you know i don't love kyrie i don't  think he can be trusted but  you know if you get them i'm not you
KNl9UJkeEHM,24528400,24533680,know i'm probably going to get on board  i mean what am i going to do not not not  be a fan of it so
KNl9UJkeEHM,24533680,24540320,uh we'll see what happens uh he did list  dallas as a potential destination he'd  be interested in
KNl9UJkeEHM,24540320,24547040,nicholas got shalian how many undrafted  players can join an nba how can they  join an nba team on drafted guys they
KNl9UJkeEHM,24547040,24554320,just sign with them and then they  compete for officer spots i mean it's no  different than the nfl i don't know if  you follow the nfl but after the draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,24554320,24559680,guys who didn't get drafted get signed  usually they get to prove themselves in  summer league and if they show out then
KNl9UJkeEHM,24559680,24564718,they can either join sign on an active  uh roster contract or they can sign on a
KNl9UJkeEHM,24564718,24570240,two-way contract i think the two-way  contract has been huge for guys who have  gone on draft it gives them an
KNl9UJkeEHM,24570240,24576958,opportunity to play some in the g league  and also play on the active team as well  who will be the next big player trader
KNl9UJkeEHM,24576958,24583600,not just small player big player like is  kyrie going to be that guy could durant  get traded let us know in the comments
KNl9UJkeEHM,24583600,24588718,who will be the next player that gets  dealt maybe jon collins
KNl9UJkeEHM,24588718,24594320,chanav thoughts on denver's draft  um
KNl9UJkeEHM,24594320,24600958,i like christian brown  i think that was a good pick  um i think he'll help right away i
KNl9UJkeEHM,24600958,24607760,thought they reached for their second  pick but uh i think overall  uh if brown can come in and contribute
KNl9UJkeEHM,24607760,24614000,you got to be pretty happy  dui why didn't the nba give the picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,24614000,24621280,taken from miami and chicago to the two  worst teams by record  i  asked the nba i you know i i don't think
KNl9UJkeEHM,24621280,24629200,it makes sense to just say oh okc here's  another pick just because we took it  from miami in chicago so uh i just think
KNl9UJkeEHM,24629200,24634878,uh they determined that those teams  crossed the line too far and tampering  so they just eliminated the picks all
KNl9UJkeEHM,24634878,24641680,together  billy bazzaning why could they choose  kai soto why our country is counting on
KNl9UJkeEHM,24641680,24647680,him can he still play in the nba a lot  of uh coach from the nba teams promised  us but at the end just hard feelings
KNl9UJkeEHM,24647680,24653040,number one he can absolutely play still  he can still sign i expect him to sign  and play in the summer league uh if he
KNl9UJkeEHM,24653040,24658478,wants to if not he can play overseas um  listen kai soto's still a little bit raw
KNl9UJkeEHM,24658478,24664080,but there's some potential there i know  uh you guys uh from the philippines uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,24664080,24670000,are big fans of him and i understand why  like he he he's a guy that you know feel  like you feel like has a chance to play
KNl9UJkeEHM,24670000,24676080,in the nba so i hope he gets signed i  hope an nba team gives him a chance and  let's see what he can do because he
KNl9UJkeEHM,24676080,24682080,certainly has some potential as a big at  seven foot two
KNl9UJkeEHM,24682080,24687200,max's podcast with the super chat what's  your thoughts on who denver signed the
KNl9UJkeEHM,24687200,24693440,dude from villanova oh uh did they sign  colin gillespie  yes uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,24693440,24698718,great pickup i think uh he's an elite  shooter 41 from three last year he
KNl9UJkeEHM,24698718,24705200,doesn't do much else but like as a guy  that can you know maybe fight for a  roster spot is just a pure lethal
KNl9UJkeEHM,24705200,24710718,shooter and it comes from a winning  program so yeah i'm a big fan of that  for denver

KNl9UJkeEHM,24930240,24935840,description of this video so it's now  time for the much anticipated 2022 nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,24935840,24942958,draft grades and we start off with the  atlanta hawks two selections tonight aj  griffin at number 16 tyrese martin the
KNl9UJkeEHM,24942958,24948558,forward out of yukon round 251 i really  like the selection of aj griffin i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,24948558,24955040,over time he can become a very good  offensive player the medicals do concern  me though missed two years of high
KNl9UJkeEHM,24955040,24960400,school basketball with the ankle and  knee injuries but  primarily because of the selection of aj
KNl9UJkeEHM,24960400,24966878,griffin and how i think he figures on to  that roster gonna give the atlanta hawks  a b-minus grade i don't really care
KNl9UJkeEHM,24966878,24973920,about the second round selection it all  comes down to aj griffin for me b-minus  for atlanta as for the boston celtics
KNl9UJkeEHM,24973920,24979280,one pick tonight there were some  rumblings that they would try to trade  into the first round they didn't do it
KNl9UJkeEHM,24979280,24984878,brad stevens staying put they dropped jd  davison a really good athlete at the
KNl9UJkeEHM,24984878,24991760,guard spot gonna have to develop over  time did some nice things at alabama  last year but certainly does have some
KNl9UJkeEHM,24991760,24998478,unproven aspects to his game  because jd davison is the only selection  for boston i'm gonna give them a c grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,24998478,25006000,i don't think he moves the needle all  that much i don't know if he's gonna  make the opening night roster boston  celtics get ac as for the brooklyn nets
KNl9UJkeEHM,25006000,25011520,no draft selections in the draft as we  know they've been busy in years past  with all of the player movement that's
KNl9UJkeEHM,25011520,25017440,taken place on that roster and a for  them because they didn't make a  selection as for the charlotte hornets i
KNl9UJkeEHM,25017440,25023520,said going into the draft you need a big  you need a rim runner who can play  alongside lamelo ball they got that in
KNl9UJkeEHM,25023520,25030958,mark williams then bryce mcgowan's round  240th overall i thought that was  excellent value many draft evaluators
KNl9UJkeEHM,25030958,25037200,thought he could sneak into the first  round you get them at number 40 and  because of that i like what the hornets
KNl9UJkeEHM,25037200,25044718,did surrounding lamella ball with a good  complimentary cast most importantly that  big guy who can give you a lot of good
KNl9UJkeEHM,25044718,25051040,play on both ends of the floor be great  for the charlotte hornets as for the  chicago bulls they get a really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,25051040,25056160,wing defender in dale and terry who  reminds me a lot of andre iguodala this
KNl9UJkeEHM,25056160,25061600,isn't gonna move the needle all that  much offensively but long term  defensively the bulls needed to get
KNl9UJkeEHM,25061600,25067200,better in that department dale and terry  will help that i'm not sure how much he  plays as a rookie but i do like the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25067200,25073520,selection somewhat b minus grade as  arizona had a couple of wildcats get  selected tonight
KNl9UJkeEHM,25073520,25080160,shout out your favorite team in the  comment section right now and then when  you do that grade their draft on a scale
KNl9UJkeEHM,25080160,25087040,of one to one hundred how do you think  your squad did in the 2022 nba draft  it's your opportunity to go back to
KNl9UJkeEHM,25087040,25094080,school chime into the comments and be a  part of the show let me know right now  the cleveland cavaliers were very busy
KNl9UJkeEHM,25094080,25102080,they had some of the most picks among  individual teams in this draft class  ochai obaji round 1 14th overall khalifa
KNl9UJkeEHM,25102080,25109680,gia isaiah mobley the brother of evan  teaming back up with his brother as they  both start at usc then luke travers
KNl9UJkeEHM,25109680,25116000,round 256 out of perth g'day mate  because of obagi he is an immediate
KNl9UJkeEHM,25116000,25122320,plug-in  play day one type of player who can come  in off the bench give you really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,25122320,25128638,defense and knock down some three-point  shots the makings of this cleveland  cavaliers roster darius garland evan
KNl9UJkeEHM,25128638,25136478,mobley isaac ocoro  jarrett allen that's a really good team  i do like the addition of obashi dallas
KNl9UJkeEHM,25136478,25143280,mavericks they traded away that first  round pick for christian wood basically  they gave up number 26 for a big man who
KNl9UJkeEHM,25143280,25150160,is more durable than kristaps porzingis  and on any given night can give you 18  and 9. so i'm not factoring that into
KNl9UJkeEHM,25150160,25155360,the grade i am factoring the value of  jaden hardy into this grade it's a b
KNl9UJkeEHM,25155360,25163520,because of the value that you get the  mavericks had them on their big board at  about 18 19 has shades of cameron thomas

KNl9UJkeEHM,25200160,25206478,the description of this video so we  continue to keep things churning with  our draft grades and we move ahead to
KNl9UJkeEHM,25206478,25213040,the denver nuggets christian brown at  21st overall is another pick that i  really liked there were some draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,25213040,25219680,evaluators that thought that brown was  going to go into the second round i  thought that was ludicrous now you look  at the other two picks here they don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,25219680,25226320,really do much for me i want to focus on  brown here for a playoff team that's  getting jamal murray back and michael
KNl9UJkeEHM,25226320,25231920,porter jr to team up alongside the joker  i think that brown as a guy who can
KNl9UJkeEHM,25231920,25237600,knock down some threes guard multiple  positions give you energy and  athleticism i think is going to be an
KNl9UJkeEHM,25237600,25244400,impact player as a rookie detroit  pistons they are building something  special they really really are
KNl9UJkeEHM,25244400,25251120,jaden ivy  cade cunningham jalen duran all of the  other young pieces on that roster they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25251120,25258878,have the makings of a couple of years  being a very solid team the fact that  your future backcourt is basically a
KNl9UJkeEHM,25258878,25264638,little bit less of an athletic john  moran and cade cunningham who could have  been rookie of the year last year they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25264638,25269920,are putting everything together right  now in a really impressive fashion  couple years ago you thought they were
KNl9UJkeEHM,25269920,25276080,going to be in the basement  of the nba for a really long time  they've turned it around really quickly
KNl9UJkeEHM,25276080,25281280,a plus grade cannot wait to see jayden  ivey and cade cunningham ball out as for
KNl9UJkeEHM,25281280,25286958,the golden state warriors they held on  to pick number 28 and they got a former  five-star recruit coming out of high
KNl9UJkeEHM,25286958,25294638,school and patrick baldwin jr who  elected to go play for his dad at an  hbcu at milwaukee and didn't have a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,25294638,25300558,complimentary cast his offensive  production was bad i think a lot of that  was because the supporting cast wasn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,25300558,25306718,all that good dealt with injuries dealt  with covid but as a guy who can get a  shout out from anywhere and down the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25306718,25312400,road projects to be a very good three  and d player with a sweet stroke from  anywhere on the floor i like it then
KNl9UJkeEHM,25312400,25319520,ryan rollins another really good pick  there like the value they weren't as  active late in the round in the second
KNl9UJkeEHM,25319520,25325520,round as we thought they were going to  be the golden state warriors get a b  grade for the defending champions which
KNl9UJkeEHM,25325520,25332400,one do you prefer during the nba  offseason calendar is it the draft type  d is it free agency type f in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25332400,25339440,comment section once again i'm fielding  all of your responses down below many  more draft grades to get to here on the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25339440,25344478,show we go to the houston rockets now  the fact that they got jabari smith the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25344478,25350240,number one player on my big board at  number three is ridiculous now according  to reports they were content with
KNl9UJkeEHM,25350240,25356638,getting whichever of the tr the trio of  jabari smith palomin karachat holmgren  in my opinion they get the best player
KNl9UJkeEHM,25356638,25362080,in this draft in jabari smith tori eason  they thought was the best defender in  this draft class
KNl9UJkeEHM,25362080,25367120,basically that's all that he's gonna  have to do and be a rim rocker and a  high flyer and a guy who can knock down
KNl9UJkeEHM,25367120,25372240,some threes so smith and tori eason with  where they got them awesome and really
KNl9UJkeEHM,25372240,25378958,because of jabari smith you team them up  alongside jalen green you have two elite  wings and in my opinion in the nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,25378958,25385600,nowadays you win with elite level wing  play now the rockets have two young  stars i think smith is going to be a
KNl9UJkeEHM,25385600,25390878,stud he loves getting in the lab indiana  pacers benedict matheran andrew nemheart
KNl9UJkeEHM,25390878,25396718,out of gonzaga a five-year player there  then kendall brown the wing out of  baylor  indiana's done some nice things the last
KNl9UJkeEHM,25396718,25403280,couple of years the trade last year for  tyrus halliburton chris duarte last year  i'm high on benedict matherin i
KNl9UJkeEHM,25403280,25409120,personally had him as a top five  prospect in this class i'm giving the  indiana pacers a b-plus grade now i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,25409120,25415760,not sure if rick carlisle is going to be  the future coach of indiana a couple of  years from now but they're starting to  put together something special do they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25415760,25423200,hold on to malcolm brogdon we'll see but  benedict matherin can be an impact  high-level two-way player down the road
KNl9UJkeEHM,25423200,25429360,with a little bit of fine-tuning to his  handle the three-point stroke already  pretty clean los angeles clippers one
KNl9UJkeEHM,25429360,25434558,pick tonight musa diabate the forward  out of michigan this guy has incredible
KNl9UJkeEHM,25434558,25440958,length can be a really good defender a  lot of unknowns with him and i'm not all  too high on the prospect i'm gonna give
KNl9UJkeEHM,25440958,25446320,the clippers a c grade here it's really  tough to give these teams higher grades
KNl9UJkeEHM,25446320,25451440,when they only make one pick especially  when it's in the second round like the  clippers and the boston celtics as for
KNl9UJkeEHM,25451440,25458718,the los angeles lakers what's  interesting here they signed scottie  pippen jr as udfa as well as sharif
KNl9UJkeEHM,25458718,25464558,o'neal now that's going to be a two-way  contract for pippin and it's going to be  a summer league only deal for sharif
KNl9UJkeEHM,25464558,25472240,o'neal but for max christie  down the road can project to be a three  and d player 35 pretty solid value there
KNl9UJkeEHM,25472240,25479120,has to improve that three-point stroke i  do not expect him to play all that much  as a rookie it's a c plus grade for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25479120,25485920,los angeles lakers  max christie really is just solid as for  the memphis grizzlies jake laravey at 19
KNl9UJkeEHM,25485920,25492400,david roddy at 23.  kennedy chandler in the second round  vince williams at 47. vince williams
KNl9UJkeEHM,25492400,25497600,shot around 40 from distance with vcu  laravia is a kyle anderson type of
KNl9UJkeEHM,25497600,25504638,player can do really everything on the  floor kennedy chandler at 38 is some of  the best value among anybody in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,25504638,25511680,draft then david roddy has a fascinating  body at like 260 pounds but kennedy  chandler tyrese maxi shades and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25511680,25516958,grizzlies have done a great job of  player development they continue to  crush it in the offseason with their
KNl9UJkeEHM,25516958,25522240,player analysis i'm going with a b grade  for the memphis grizzlies we keep it
KNl9UJkeEHM,25522240,25528798,moving with the miami heat one pick  tonight they held on to it at 27 and  they got arguably the best international
KNl9UJkeEHM,25528798,25536080,prospect in this class a lot of people  might say oozman jang but nikola yovic  contested shot making ability is not the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25536080,25542160,most explosive or springy athlete but  what do i expect the heat to do i expect  them to do what they always do and
KNl9UJkeEHM,25542160,25548798,develop prospects and that's what i  expect them to do with yovic why i'm  giving them an a grade fantastic value
KNl9UJkeEHM,25548798,25556000,this late for a player who could have  gone in the teens milwaukee bucks now  marjon beauchamp out of the g league the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25556000,25561520,wing at number 24. you play alongside  giannis i think he's going to be able to  bring the best out of him then hugo
KNl9UJkeEHM,25561520,25568240,bessen picked mr irrelevant at 58  overall the final pick in the draft he  played with oozman jang with the new
KNl9UJkeEHM,25568240,25573440,zealand breakers in the nbl in australia  milwaukee bucks do get a b minus grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,25573440,25579360,this isn't a team that needed to do much  this isn't a team that needed to blow  the doors off of anything a b minus
KNl9UJkeEHM,25579360,25585120,grade pretty solid for milwaukee a  couple more grades left here minnesota  timberwolves walker kessler as their
KNl9UJkeEHM,25585120,25591040,backup big nearly five blocks per game  last year and was the defensive player  of the year in college basketball for
KNl9UJkeEHM,25591040,25596160,auburn wendell moore i kind of thought  he was going to go in the second round  you get him at 26. was it a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,25596160,25603280,of a reach maybe and then the other two  picks they're pretty solid um the  athletic they had minnow going in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25603280,25609440,first round or at least a top 15  prospect  i don't really like this game because he  didn't really play that much he's still
KNl9UJkeEHM,25609440,25615280,somewhat unproven so i'm going c plus  grade here for the minnesota  timberwolves make sure you subscribe to
KNl9UJkeEHM,25615280,25621360,us here at chat sports we cook up  content like this we went live for seven  hours for the nba draft and a week from
KNl9UJkeEHM,25621360,25626478,today we'll be live for nba free agency  you don't want to miss any of it make  sure you subscribe by hitting that red
KNl9UJkeEHM,25626478,25632240,sub button down below new orleans  pelicans now at eighth overall there  were some rumblings they'd go oozeman
KNl9UJkeEHM,25632240,25638240,jang they go dyson daniels has to work  on his three-point shot desperately  needs to but basically does everything
KNl9UJkeEHM,25638240,25644160,well another one of the great value  selections ej liddell i had him go in 18  of the chicago bulls on my final mock
KNl9UJkeEHM,25644160,25651440,the fact that he slid this late it's  criminal then carlo mackavich out of  mega basket round to 52 overall new
KNl9UJkeEHM,25651440,25656718,orleans next year  last year they were an upstart team in  the nba they pushed the phoenix suns the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25656718,25662240,number one seed in the west of six games  if they get zion williamson back they're  gonna be a problem and i think liddell
KNl9UJkeEHM,25662240,25669440,can play right away and i think that  dyson daniels can come in off the bench  and also play and get some burn new york
KNl9UJkeEHM,25669440,25675520,knicks  trevor keels round 242 overall but there  were so many trades that happened with
KNl9UJkeEHM,25675520,25681840,the new york knicks that we are giving  the knicks right now just a shrug emoji  and if you translate the shrug emoji to
KNl9UJkeEHM,25681840,25688478,a grade maybe it's a c minus or a d  i thought the knicks should have tried  to have made a selection at number 11
KNl9UJkeEHM,25688478,25695280,overall they got rid of the cap space  for kemba walker but basically they  traded away their pick they didn't draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,25695280,25701360,until late they got rid of kemba walker  and they cleared money for a player in  jalen brunson who we're not even sure
KNl9UJkeEHM,25701360,25707120,they're going to sign head scratcher  that's why it's this emoji oklahoma city  thunder
KNl9UJkeEHM,25707120,25713440,they blew the doors off of this draft  and now in chet holmgren uzman jang and
KNl9UJkeEHM,25713440,25718798,jalen williams they have all of these  guys who have north of a seven foot
KNl9UJkeEHM,25718798,25725520,wingspan what they did and what they're  doing right now and the talent and  different bodies and athletes that they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25725520,25732080,are compiling a grade for okc right up  there with detroit right up there with  the houston rockets these young
KNl9UJkeEHM,25732080,25739520,burgeoning teams in the nba doing some  really impressive things as for the  orlando magic palo banquero at number
KNl9UJkeEHM,25739520,25745040,one i personally would have went with  jabari smith but i think that paulo  bencaro one of the most pro-ready
KNl9UJkeEHM,25745040,25751920,prospects in this draft class caleb  houston at number 32 pretty solid pick  there i thought he maybe could have gone
KNl9UJkeEHM,25751920,25758320,mid-30s in the 40s but  the magic get him there at the start of  the second round at 32 overall paulo
KNl9UJkeEHM,25758320,25765040,bencaro i'm giving the magic a b-plus  grade because of this he will really  help out that team now i thought they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25765040,25770718,should have drafted a wing like jabari  because that was the need there i like  the fit and i like the player just a tad
KNl9UJkeEHM,25770718,25778400,bit better it's a smidge it's a slight  smidge but pella bencaro basketball iq  versatile game really can do everything
KNl9UJkeEHM,25778400,25785440,well and at that forward spot can really  score from all three levels philadelphia  76ers they didn't do anything no draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,25785440,25791600,picks they traded away um danny green  and they were able to get a nice little
KNl9UJkeEHM,25791600,25796798,acquisition and d'anthony melton who's  going to be a scorer off the bench but  they didn't make any picks so no grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,25796798,25804320,there same can be said for the phoenix  suns no grade for the suns because they  didn't make any selections either either
KNl9UJkeEHM,25804320,25810558,excuse me so you can rip me in the  comments you can let me know what you  think about what i did
KNl9UJkeEHM,25810558,25816240,let me know what you think i did with  these draft grades portland trailblazers  here shade and sharp at number seven i
KNl9UJkeEHM,25816240,25821440,love the pick there are so many unknowns  about this kid he reclassified was the  number one high school recruit
KNl9UJkeEHM,25821440,25827040,originally went to college early  enrolled at kentucky in january has
KNl9UJkeEHM,25827040,25832478,bradley bill jalen green scoring ability  jabari walker 57 ford out of colorado
KNl9UJkeEHM,25832478,25838478,good player who sometimes got  overshadowed last year shane sharp is  going to be able to learn from damian  lillard i think he's going to be a
KNl9UJkeEHM,25838478,25844000,walking bucket he's going to be able to  put the biscuit in the basket right away  because he can really get a shot off
KNl9UJkeEHM,25844000,25849600,from anywhere on the floor b grade for  the portland trailblazers sacramento  kings daughter's a little bit of a reach
KNl9UJkeEHM,25849600,25855040,going keegan murray here i think they  drafted for need  instead of best player available best
KNl9UJkeEHM,25855040,25860718,player available was jay nivey  word is he didn't want to get drafted by  the sacramento kings and there wasn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,25860718,25866798,much communication there so they go  keegan murray who in my opinion is a  more athletic l horford again certainly
KNl9UJkeEHM,25866798,25871920,fulfills a need there on that sacramento  kings roster it's a c-plus though  because i thought it was a little bit of
KNl9UJkeEHM,25871920,25878958,a reach i do think that he is a polished  player san antonio spurs they did some  good stuff here jeremy sohan
KNl9UJkeEHM,25878958,25885440,i think factors into being maybe a  draymond green or a ben simmons at the  fourth type he proves that scoring isn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,25885440,25892400,everything at the nba level malachi  branham the wing out of ohio state at  number 20 blake wesley at number 25
KNl9UJkeEHM,25892400,25899600,three young players who you can build  around all teenagers by the way who can  really help streamline the development
KNl9UJkeEHM,25899600,25906320,the growth and getting the spurs back to  elite level basketball now what happens  with greg popovich down the road we will
KNl9UJkeEHM,25906320,25911920,see i think quinn sadder will replace  him and if he does have some really good  young pieces on that roster toronto
KNl9UJkeEHM,25911920,25919040,raptors made one pick it was christian  koloko 33rd overall for arguably the  best shot blocker in this draft class
KNl9UJkeEHM,25919040,25925440,really good value there for a guy who i  think has a lot of upside and because i  like the pick so much i'm going a grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,25925440,25931200,for the toronto raptors they've been a  player development factory they've done  some terrific things over time i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,25931200,25938400,they're going to be able to turn  christian koloko into a very solid  player what does it do for president  chachua i'm not really sure but koloko
KNl9UJkeEHM,25938400,25945040,and the drafting of him maybe it takes  him out of the rudy gobert sweepstakes  utah jazz did not make a pick they have
KNl9UJkeEHM,25945040,25951760,a lot of questions with this roster  who's going to be the next head coach  we're not sure are they going to trade  away donovan mitchell rudy gobert we
KNl9UJkeEHM,25951760,25958878,will see not available for that draft  grade last one coming in here washington  wizards johnny davis number 10 overall
KNl9UJkeEHM,25958878,25963920,one of the best scorers in college  basketball last year then unique and  zozo i think it's going to be a draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,25963920,25969600,and stash but for davis let's say that  the war uh the wizards excuse me they
KNl9UJkeEHM,25969600,25975920,have bradley beal opt-in and he signs  that long-term contract extension  doesn't mean he's going to be there for  the duration of that contract but it
KNl9UJkeEHM,25975920,25982240,means and it signals that they're going  to try to win right now because that's  what bo wants to do johnny davis can  allow them to do that with some of the
KNl9UJkeEHM,25982240,25988000,best scorers in college basketball last  year and a very good defender as well  giving the washington wizards some
KNl9UJkeEHM,25988000,25994080,people call them the wizards a b  grade so that does it for our 2022 nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,25994080,25999520,draft grades who will be the best player  from this draft class let me know and
KNl9UJkeEHM,25999520,26005040,again let me know how i did with the  giraffe grades some people are gonna  love me some people will hate me but

KNl9UJkeEHM,26713360,26718878,you know there was  some folks who thought he could get  drafted i didn't know if he would
KNl9UJkeEHM,26718878,26724798,obviously he did not uh but i do think  he'll land with the team for the summer  league and he'll get to show off his
KNl9UJkeEHM,26724798,26731840,talents and uh we wish him the best here  at chat sports we're huge fans of kai  soto here
KNl9UJkeEHM,26731920,26739440,rogue brother should the clippers have  traded up to the first to get tai tai  washington and should they have traded  up to get ishmael kamagadi um you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,26739440,26744558,taitai fallen to 29 for houston um was  the steal for the rockets i liked that
KNl9UJkeEHM,26744558,26751760,quite a bit i do wonder if the clippers  are trying to keep some cap flexibility  they've been linked to kyrie irving as a
KNl9UJkeEHM,26751760,26759360,potential destination for him  so you know you could say yes because  they need some more guards uh but uh i
KNl9UJkeEHM,26759360,26764718,understand why they did not make that  move uh they didn't have a lot of  capital uh to go up and get ty ty
KNl9UJkeEHM,26764718,26769920,washington  evan henderson udfa dominick barlow and
KNl9UJkeEHM,26769920,26777040,has to resend levine and thompson and  next week sign mitchell robinson i i'll  focus on mitchell robinson here and zach
KNl9UJkeEHM,26777040,26782160,levine  bringing back levine needs to be a  priority for chicago i get he's not the
KNl9UJkeEHM,26782160,26787840,perfect player but you can't let him  walk uh mitchell robinson is a guy that
KNl9UJkeEHM,26787840,26793760,i would be interested in if i was  chicago now i wonder if  you would have to move vuchevich to go
KNl9UJkeEHM,26793760,26800798,get him because robinson's the starting  caliber center and you're not going to  play him and vooch next to each other  but if you can move get it move
KNl9UJkeEHM,26800798,26806000,vooch i should say get off from under  his contract and then robinson comes to
KNl9UJkeEHM,26806000,26813600,town as a defensive anchor and a guy who  can score a little bit as well i'd be  very open to that idea
KNl9UJkeEHM,26813600,26820958,burner kingdom chance brunt's brunson  leave so the new york knicks during the  draft the maneuvers they made they're
KNl9UJkeEHM,26820958,26827840,clearing cap space they traded kimball  walker they traded down from 11. um  they're making a run at brunson maybe a
KNl9UJkeEHM,26827840,26833040,kyrie irving they're trying to maximize  cap space so keep an eye on them i'll
KNl9UJkeEHM,26833040,26839760,say this jalen brunson will play for one  of two teams next year the dallas  mavericks or the new york knicks it will
KNl9UJkeEHM,26839760,26846160,not be another organization dallas  drafted jaden hardy maybe that's a  little insurance if brunson does leave
KNl9UJkeEHM,26846160,26853040,uh but uh i still think uh the mavs are  the favorites to keep him uh but if the  knicks offer like 30 million a year then
KNl9UJkeEHM,26853040,26860398,maybe they'll opt to not do that who do  you guys think was the biggest winner of  the nba draft let us know down in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,26860398,26866320,comment section the biggest winner of  this year's draft let me know what you  guys think down in the comments right
KNl9UJkeEHM,26866320,26874398,now biggest winner of the 2022 draft  mark jacob duvall uh mavs trade tim
KNl9UJkeEHM,26874398,26882558,hardaway jalen brunson frank nilakina  josh gray and jaden hardy and a future  first round pick for zach levine
KNl9UJkeEHM,26882558,26888958,i don't think i'd want to give up that  much and i like levine a lot but i mean  you're giving up tim
KNl9UJkeEHM,26888958,26894080,and brunson who are two heavy rotation  players a future first a guy in jaden
KNl9UJkeEHM,26894080,26901440,hardy who is a first round caliber  player and frank lakina and josh green  who are a rotation player so you're  giving up six pieces that can at least
KNl9UJkeEHM,26901440,26907120,contribute for levine i like levine  that's a lot though
KNl9UJkeEHM,26907120,26912638,okay lemuel corpus what are the best  trades that happened during  i think he meant draft night
KNl9UJkeEHM,26912638,26919280,um i like dallas moving to future first  to go get jaden hardy at 37. um
KNl9UJkeEHM,26919280,26925840,what are some notable ones that rockets  move down to still get ty ty washington  at 29 is pretty impressive i like that
KNl9UJkeEHM,26925840,26932080,move  um  you know  there wasn't a lot of blockbuster draft  trades there really wasn't now
KNl9UJkeEHM,26932080,26938478,technically the christian wood trade  didn't take pla didn't become official  until draft night but dallas uh you know
KNl9UJkeEHM,26938478,26944000,moves 26 and some players to get  christian wood if you want to count that  one i would say that was a pretty uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,26944000,26950638,good one for the mavs but  there wasn't a lot of blockbusters uh  during the actual draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,26950638,26956080,john linus jalen green or kai soto  i mean jalen green's already somewhat
KNl9UJkeEHM,26956080,26963360,proven in the nba so i'd have to ring j  lean jalen green but hey we love kai  soto here at chat sports big kaisoto

KNl9UJkeEHM,26986320,26992478,channel  vamp why would the knicks make all those  moves if they didn't know they were
KNl9UJkeEHM,26992478,26998558,getting brunson  um  listen maybe they know something we
KNl9UJkeEHM,26998558,27005360,don't maybe they have a good feeling but  maybe they're also saying hey if we  don't get bronson we can go after kyrie  or maybe kyrie is the target or maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,27005360,27010798,they just want cap flexibility  regardless of the scenario it's not like  kimball walker is a part of their future
KNl9UJkeEHM,27010798,27016958,so moving him doesn't hurt  sure trading down from 11 if you don't  get brunson or irving and you just fill
KNl9UJkeEHM,27016958,27023520,out that cap with random pieces sure  that hurts but you also got future  firsts in the move um i don't think it's
KNl9UJkeEHM,27023520,27029920,that big of a risk for the knicks to  clear the space and make a run at one of  those two players
KNl9UJkeEHM,27030478,27035680,wowser kimball walker landing spy yeah  he's gonna get bought out it sounds like
KNl9UJkeEHM,27035680,27042558,you know i look at a team that  is  a competing team that needs a backup
KNl9UJkeEHM,27042558,27049520,point guard like  honestly boston back to boston i don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,27049520,27055920,hate it  um  you know i i know that didn't work out  well but if he's a backup i actually
KNl9UJkeEHM,27055920,27061920,don't mind it uh producer jack's a  celtics fan not a fan of that idea but i  i think i'm not sure if peyton
KNl9UJkeEHM,27061920,27068638,pritchard's the long like a proven  backup point guard option yet uh how  about chicago maybe
KNl9UJkeEHM,27068638,27075280,you know a team like milwaukee could use  a backup point i think those are a few  teams that could make some sense now if

KNl9UJkeEHM,27104160,27110718,john david de la tree dell magic won the  draft honestly  i like van caro i think they did some
KNl9UJkeEHM,27110718,27117200,good things tonight but  uh i think some other teams did better i  love the rockets draft um i think uh the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27117200,27122798,thunder had a pretty good night uh but  orlando had a good night well as well i  think bancaro is going to be a solid
KNl9UJkeEHM,27122798,27128080,solid player  wireless kyrie signing with the mavs i
KNl9UJkeEHM,27128080,27133520,don't carry the way i love the team hey  listen um  you know i don't love kyrie i don't
KNl9UJkeEHM,27133520,27140000,think he can be trusted but  you know if you get him i'm not you know  i'm probably gonna get on board i mean
KNl9UJkeEHM,27140000,27145520,what am i gonna do not not not be a fan  of it so  uh we'll see what happens uh he did list
KNl9UJkeEHM,27145520,27152160,dallas as a potential destination he'd  be interested in  nicholas got shalian how many undrafted
KNl9UJkeEHM,27152160,27158080,players can join an nba how can they  join an nba team undrafted guys they  just sign with them and then they
KNl9UJkeEHM,27158080,27163920,compete for officer spots i mean it's no  different than the nfl i don't know if  you follow the nfl but after the draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,27163920,27169360,guys who didn't get drafted get signed  usually they get to prove themselves in  summer league and if they show out then
KNl9UJkeEHM,27169360,27176240,they can either join sign on an active  uh roster contract or they can sign on a  two-way contract i think the two-way
KNl9UJkeEHM,27176240,27181600,contract has been huge for guys who have  gone on draft it gives them an  opportunity to play some in the g league
KNl9UJkeEHM,27181600,27186638,and also play on the active team as well  who will be the next big player traded
KNl9UJkeEHM,27186638,27193280,not just small player big player like is  kyrie going to be that guy could durant  get traded let us know in the comments
KNl9UJkeEHM,27193280,27198398,who will be the next player that gets  dealt maybe jon collins
KNl9UJkeEHM,27198398,27206398,chanav thoughts on denver's draft  um i like christian brown
KNl9UJkeEHM,27206398,27212080,i think that was a good pick  um i think he'll help right away i  thought they reached for their second
KNl9UJkeEHM,27212080,27217520,pick but uh i think overall  uh  if brown can come in and contribute you
KNl9UJkeEHM,27217520,27223600,got to be pretty happy  dui why didn't the nba give the picks
KNl9UJkeEHM,27223600,27230958,taken from miami and chicago to the two  worst teams by record  i  asked the nba i you know i i don't think
KNl9UJkeEHM,27230958,27237760,it makes sense to just say oh okc here's  another pick just because we took it  from miami and chicago so
KNl9UJkeEHM,27237760,27244080,uh i just think uh they determined that  those teams crossed the line too far and  tampering so they just eliminated the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27244080,27249360,picks all together  billy bazzaning why could they choose
KNl9UJkeEHM,27249360,27255040,kai soto why our country is counting on  him can he still play in the nba a lot  of uh coach from the nba teams promised
KNl9UJkeEHM,27255040,27260638,us but at the end just hard feelings  number one he could absolutely play  still he can still sign i expect him to
KNl9UJkeEHM,27260638,27265840,sign and play in the summer league uh if  he wants to if not he can play overseas  um
KNl9UJkeEHM,27265840,27273680,listen kai soto is still a little bit  raw but there's some potential there i  know  uh you guys uh from the philippines uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,27273680,27279680,are big fans of him and i understand why  like he he he's a guy that you know feel  you feel like has a chance to play in
KNl9UJkeEHM,27279680,27286080,the nba so i hope he gets signed i hope  an nba team gives him a chance and let's  see what he can do because he certainly
KNl9UJkeEHM,27286080,27291680,has some potential as a big at seven  foot two
KNl9UJkeEHM,27291680,27296798,max's podcast with the super chat what's  your thoughts on who denver signed the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27296798,27303120,dude from villanova oh uh did they sign  colin gillespie  yes uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,27303120,27308320,great pickup i think uh he's an elite  shooter 41 from three last year he
KNl9UJkeEHM,27308320,27314878,doesn't do much else but like as a guy  that can you know maybe fight for a  roster spot is just a pure lethal
KNl9UJkeEHM,27314878,27320398,shooter and it comes from a winning  program so yeah i'm a big fan of that  for denver

KNl9UJkeEHM,27540478,27546160,of this video so it's now time for the  much anticipated 2022 nba draft grades
KNl9UJkeEHM,27546160,27553040,and we start off with the atlanta hawks  two selections tonight aj griffin at  number 16 tyrese martin the forward out
KNl9UJkeEHM,27553040,27558478,of yukon round 251 i really like the  selection of aj griffin i think over
KNl9UJkeEHM,27558478,27563600,time he can become a very good offensive  player the medicals do concern me though
KNl9UJkeEHM,27563600,27568958,missed two years of high school  basketball with the ankle and knee  injuries but primarily because of the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27568958,27575840,selection of aj griffin and how i think  he figures onto that roster gonna give  the atlanta hawks a b minus grade i
KNl9UJkeEHM,27575840,27582320,don't really care about the second round  selection it all comes down to aj  griffin for me b-minus for atlanta as
KNl9UJkeEHM,27582320,27587680,for the boston celtics one pick tonight  there were some rumblings that they  would try to trade into the first round
KNl9UJkeEHM,27587680,27593040,they didn't do it brad stevens staying  put they dropped jd davison a really
KNl9UJkeEHM,27593040,27599360,good athlete at the guard spot gonna  have to develop over time did some nice  things at alabama last year but
KNl9UJkeEHM,27599360,27606000,certainly does have some unproven  aspects to his game  because jd davison is the only selection
KNl9UJkeEHM,27606000,27612878,for boston i'm gonna give them a c grade  i don't think he moves the needle all  that much i don't know if he's gonna  make the opening night roster boston
KNl9UJkeEHM,27612878,27618000,celtics get ac as for the brooklyn nets  no draft selections in the draft as we
KNl9UJkeEHM,27618000,27623520,know they've been busy in years past  with all of the player movement that's  taken place on that roster and a for
KNl9UJkeEHM,27623520,27629440,them because they didn't make a  selection as for the charlotte hornets i  said going into the draft you need a big
KNl9UJkeEHM,27629440,27636080,you need a rim runner who can play  alongside lamelo ball they got that in  mark williams then bryce mcgowan's round
KNl9UJkeEHM,27636080,27642638,240th overall i thought that was  excellent value many draft evaluators  thought he could sneak into the first
KNl9UJkeEHM,27642638,27649120,round you get him at number 40 and  because of that i like what the hornets  did surrounding lamelo ball with a good
KNl9UJkeEHM,27649120,27654398,complimentary cast most importantly that  big guy who can give you a lot of good
KNl9UJkeEHM,27654398,27660718,play on both ends of the floor be great  for the charlotte hornets as for the  chicago bulls they get a really good
KNl9UJkeEHM,27660718,27665760,wing defender in dale and terry who  reminds me a lot of andre iguodala this
KNl9UJkeEHM,27665760,27671280,isn't going to move the needle all that  much offensively but long-term  defensively the bulls needed to get
KNl9UJkeEHM,27671280,27676798,better in that department dale and terry  will help that i'm not sure how much he  plays as a rookie but i do like the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27676798,27683200,selection somewhat b minus grade as  arizona had a couple of wildcats get  selected tonight
KNl9UJkeEHM,27683200,27689760,shout out your favorite team in the  comment section right now and then when  you do that grade their draft on a scale
KNl9UJkeEHM,27689760,27696638,of one to one hundred how do you think  your squad did in the 2022 nba draft  it's your opportunity to go back to
KNl9UJkeEHM,27696638,27703680,school chime into the comments and be a  part of the show let me know right now  the cleveland cavaliers were very busy
KNl9UJkeEHM,27703680,27711120,they had some of the most picks among  individual teams in this draft class  ochai obaji round one fourteenth overall
KNl9UJkeEHM,27711120,27716320,khalifa gia isaiah mobley the brother of  evan teaming back up with his brother as
KNl9UJkeEHM,27716320,27722718,they both start at usc then luke travers  round 256 out of perth g'day mate
KNl9UJkeEHM,27722718,27729760,because of obagi he is an immediate  plug-in  play day one type of player who can come
KNl9UJkeEHM,27729760,27735680,in off the bench give you really good  defense and knock down some three-point  shots the makings of this cleveland
KNl9UJkeEHM,27735680,27740798,cavaliers roster darius garland evan  mobley isaac okoro
KNl9UJkeEHM,27740798,27746080,jarrett allen that's a really good team  i do like the addition of obashi dallas
KNl9UJkeEHM,27746080,27752878,mavericks they traded away that first  round pick for christian wood basically  they gave up number 26 for a big man who
KNl9UJkeEHM,27752878,27759760,is more durable than kristaps porzingis  and on any given night can give you 18  and 9. so i'm not factoring that into
KNl9UJkeEHM,27759760,27765040,the grade i am factoring the value of  jaden hardy into this grade it's a b
KNl9UJkeEHM,27765040,27773120,because of the value that you get the  mavericks had him on their big board at  about 18 19 has shades of cameron thomas
KNl9UJkeEHM,27773120,27779120,he is a hyper scorer off the top of the  show i told you about aura let me tell  you more about tonight's presenting

KNl9UJkeEHM,27811920,27818398,continue to keep things churning with  our draft grades and we move ahead to  the denver nuggets christian brown at
KNl9UJkeEHM,27818398,27824798,21st overall is another pick that i  really liked there were some draft  evaluators that thought that brown was
KNl9UJkeEHM,27824798,27829840,gonna go into the second round i thought  that was ludicrous now you look at the  other two picks here they don't really
KNl9UJkeEHM,27829840,27836558,do much for me i want to focus on brown  here for a playoff team that's getting  jamal murray back and michael porter jr
KNl9UJkeEHM,27836558,27841600,the team up alongside the joker  i think that brown as a guy who can
KNl9UJkeEHM,27841600,27847200,knock down some threes guard multiple  positions give you energy and  athleticism i think is going to be an
KNl9UJkeEHM,27847200,27854080,impact player as a rookie detroit  pistons they are building something  special they really really are
KNl9UJkeEHM,27854080,27859680,jaden ivy cade cunningham jaylen durham  all of the other young pieces on that
KNl9UJkeEHM,27859680,27864958,roster they have the makings of a couple  of years being a very solid team the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27864958,27871840,fact that your future backcourt is  basically a little bit less of an  athletic john moran and cade cunningham
KNl9UJkeEHM,27871840,27877200,who could have been rookie of the year  last year they are putting everything  together right now in a really
KNl9UJkeEHM,27877200,27883760,impressive fashion couple years ago you  thought they were going to be in the  basement  of the nba for a really long time they
KNl9UJkeEHM,27883760,27888798,turned it around really quickly a plus  grade cannot wait to see jaden ivy and
KNl9UJkeEHM,27888798,27894798,cade cunningham ball out as for the  golden state warriors they held on to  pick number 28 and they got a former
KNl9UJkeEHM,27894798,27901360,five-star recruit coming out of high  school and patrick baldwin jr who  elected to go play for his dad at an
KNl9UJkeEHM,27901360,27908478,hbcu at milwaukee and didn't have a good  complimentary cast his offensive  production was bad i think a lot of that
KNl9UJkeEHM,27908478,27914558,was because the supporting cast wasn't  all that good dealt with injuries dealt  with covid but as a guy who can get a
KNl9UJkeEHM,27914558,27920558,shot off from anywhere and down the road  projects to be a very good three and d  player with a sweet stroke from anywhere
KNl9UJkeEHM,27920558,27927760,on the floor i like it then ryan rollins  another really good pick there like the  value they weren't as active late in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,27927760,27934000,round in the second round as we thought  they were going to be the golden state  warriors get a b grade for the defending
KNl9UJkeEHM,27934000,27941920,champions which one do you prefer during  the nba offseason calendar is it the  draft type d is it free agency type f in
KNl9UJkeEHM,27941920,27948878,the comment section once again i'm  fielding all of your responses down  below  many more draft grades to get to here on
KNl9UJkeEHM,27948878,27953920,the show we go to the houston rockets  now the fact that they got jabari smith
KNl9UJkeEHM,27953920,27959840,the number one player on my big board at  number three is ridiculous now according  to reports they were content with
KNl9UJkeEHM,27959840,27965920,getting whichever of the tr the trio of  jabari smith palome and karachat  holmgren in my opinion they get the best
KNl9UJkeEHM,27965920,27971680,player in this draft in jabari smith  tori eason they thought was the best  defender in this draft class
KNl9UJkeEHM,27971680,27976718,basically that's all that he's gonna  have to do and be a rim rocker and a  high flyer and a guy who can knock down
KNl9UJkeEHM,27976718,27981840,some threes so smith and tory eason with  where they got them awesome and really
KNl9UJkeEHM,27981840,27988558,because of jabari smith you team him up  alongside jalen green you have two elite  wings and in my opinion in the nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,27988558,27993600,nowadays you win with elite level wing  play now the rockets have two young
KNl9UJkeEHM,27993600,28000000,stars i think smith is going to be a  stud he loves getting in the lab indiana  pacers benedict mather and andrew
KNl9UJkeEHM,28000000,28006160,nemhart out of gonzaga a five-year  player there then kendall brown the wing  out of baylor  indiana has done some nice things the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28006160,28012878,last couple of years the trade last year  for tyra's halliburton chris duarte last  year i'm high on benedict matheran i
KNl9UJkeEHM,28012878,28018718,personally had him as a top five  prospect in this class i'm giving the  indiana pacers a b plus grade now i'm
KNl9UJkeEHM,28018718,28025440,not sure if rick carlisle is going to be  the future coach of indiana a couple  years from now but they're starting to  put together something special do they
KNl9UJkeEHM,28025440,28032798,hold on to malcolm brogdon we'll see but  benedict matherin can be an impact  high-level two-way player down the road
KNl9UJkeEHM,28032798,28038958,with a little bit of fine-tuning to his  handle the three-point stroke already  pretty clean los angeles clippers one
KNl9UJkeEHM,28038958,28044160,pick tonight musa diabote the forward  out of michigan this guy has incredible
KNl9UJkeEHM,28044160,28050398,length can be a really good defender a  lot of unknowns with him and i'm not all  too high on the prospect i'm going to
KNl9UJkeEHM,28050398,28055600,give the clippers a c grade here it's  really tough to give these teams higher
KNl9UJkeEHM,28055600,28060718,grades when they only make one pick  especially when it's in the second round  like the clippers and the boston celtics
KNl9UJkeEHM,28060718,28068320,as for the los angeles lakers what's  interesting here they signed scottie  pippen jr as udfa as well as sharif
KNl9UJkeEHM,28068320,28074240,o'neal now that's going to be a two-way  contract for pippin and it's going to be  a summer league only deal for sharif
KNl9UJkeEHM,28074240,28081840,o'neill but for max christie  down the road can project to be a three  and d player 35 pretty solid value there
KNl9UJkeEHM,28081840,28088718,has to improve that three-point stroke i  do not expect him to play all that much  as a rookie it's a c-plus grade for the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28088718,28095520,los angeles lakers  max christie really is just solid as for  the memphis grizzlies jake laravey at 19
KNl9UJkeEHM,28095520,28102080,david roddy at 23  kennedy chandler in the second round  vince williams at 47. vince williams
KNl9UJkeEHM,28102080,28107200,shot around 40 from distance with vcu  laravia is a kyle anderson type of
KNl9UJkeEHM,28107200,28114240,player can do really everything on the  floor kennedy chandler at 38 is some of  the best value among anybody in this
KNl9UJkeEHM,28114240,28121280,draft then david roddy has a fascinating  body at like 260 pounds but kennedy  chandler tyrese maxi shades and the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28121280,28126638,grizzlies have done a great job of  player development they continue to  crush it in the offseason with their
KNl9UJkeEHM,28126638,28131920,player analysis i'm going with a b grade  for the memphis grizzlies we keep it
KNl9UJkeEHM,28131920,28138398,moving with the miami heat one pick  tonight they held on to it at 27 and  they got arguably the best international
KNl9UJkeEHM,28138398,28145680,prospect in this class a lot of people  might say oozman jang but nikola yovic  contested shot making ability is not the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28145680,28151760,most explosive or springy athlete but  what do i expect the heat to do i expect  them to do what they always do and
KNl9UJkeEHM,28151760,28158398,develop prospects and that's what i  expect them to do with yovic why i'm  giving them an a grade fantastic value
KNl9UJkeEHM,28158398,28165600,this late for a player who could have  gone in the teens milwaukee bucks now  marjon beauchamp out of the g league the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28165600,28171120,wing at number 24. you play alongside  giannis i think he's going to be able to  bring the best out of him then hugo
KNl9UJkeEHM,28171120,28177840,bessen picked mr irrelevant at 58  overall the final pick in the draft he  played with oozman zhang with the new
KNl9UJkeEHM,28177840,28183040,zealand breakers in the nbl in australia  milwaukee bucks do get a b minus grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,28183040,28188958,this isn't a team that needed to do much  this isn't a team that needed to blow  the doors off of anything a b minus
KNl9UJkeEHM,28188958,28194718,grade pretty solid for milwaukee a  couple more grades left here minnesota  timberwolves walker kessler as their
KNl9UJkeEHM,28194718,28200718,backup big nearly five blocks per game  last year and was the defensive player  of the year in college basketball for
KNl9UJkeEHM,28200718,28205760,auburn wendell moore i kind of thought  he was going to go in the second round  you get him at 26. was it a little bit
KNl9UJkeEHM,28205760,28212878,of a reach maybe and then the other two  picks they're pretty solid um the  athletic they had minnow going in the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28212878,28219120,first round or at least a top 15  prospect  i don't really like this game because he  didn't really play that much he's still
KNl9UJkeEHM,28219120,28224878,somewhat unproven so i'm going c plus  grade here for the minnesota  timberwolves make sure you subscribe to
KNl9UJkeEHM,28224878,28230958,us here at chat sports we cook up  content like this we went live for seven  hours for the nba draft and a week from
KNl9UJkeEHM,28230958,28236080,today we'll be live for nba free agency  you don't want to miss any of it make  sure you subscribe by hitting that red
KNl9UJkeEHM,28236080,28241840,sub button down below new orleans  pelicans now at eighth overall there  were some rumblings they'd go oozeman
KNl9UJkeEHM,28241840,28247840,jang they go dyson daniels has to work  on his three-point shot desperately  needs to but basically does everything
KNl9UJkeEHM,28247840,28253760,well another one of the great value  selections ej liddell i had him go in 18  to the chicago bulls on my final mock
KNl9UJkeEHM,28253760,28261040,the fact that he slid this late it's  criminal then carlo mackavich out of  mega basket round to 52 overall new
KNl9UJkeEHM,28261040,28266398,orleans next year  last year they were an upstart team in  the nba they pushed the phoenix suns the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28266398,28271440,number one seed in the west is six games  if they get zion williamson back they're  going to be a problem and i think
KNl9UJkeEHM,28271440,28278558,liddell can play right away and i think  that dyson daniels can come in off the  bench and also play and get some burn
KNl9UJkeEHM,28278558,28283680,new york knicks  trevor keels round 242 overall but there
KNl9UJkeEHM,28283680,28288878,were so many trades that happened with  the new york knicks that we are giving  the knicks right now just the shrug
KNl9UJkeEHM,28288878,28294638,emoji and if you translate the shrug  emoji to a grade maybe it's a c minus or  a d
KNl9UJkeEHM,28294638,28300080,i thought the knicks should have tried  to have made a selection at number 11  overall they got rid of the cap space
KNl9UJkeEHM,28300080,28307360,for kemba walker but basically they  traded away their pick they didn't draft  until late they got rid of kemba walker
KNl9UJkeEHM,28307360,28312958,and they cleared money for a player in  jalen brunson who we're not even sure  they're going to sign head scratcher
KNl9UJkeEHM,28312958,28319920,that's why it's this emoji oklahoma city  thunder  they blew the doors off of this draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,28319920,28325440,and now in chet holmgren uzman jang and  jalen williams they have all of these
KNl9UJkeEHM,28325440,28331280,guys who have north of a seven foot  wingspan  what they did and what they're doing
KNl9UJkeEHM,28331280,28338160,right now and the talent and different  bodies and athletes that they are  compiling a grade for okc right up there
KNl9UJkeEHM,28338160,28344878,with detroit right up there with the  houston rockets these young burgeoning  teams in the nba doing some really
KNl9UJkeEHM,28344878,28351440,impressive things as for the orlando  magic palo banquero at number one i  personally would have went with jabari
KNl9UJkeEHM,28351440,28358558,smith but i think that paulo bencaro one  of the most pro ready prospects in this  draft class caleb houston at number 32
KNl9UJkeEHM,28358558,28363840,pretty solid pick there i thought he  maybe could have gone mid-30s in the 40s  but
KNl9UJkeEHM,28363840,28369760,the magic get him there at the start of  the second round at 32 overall paulo  bencaro i'm giving the magic a b-plus
KNl9UJkeEHM,28369760,28375840,grade because of this  he will really help out that team now i  thought they should have drafted a wing
KNl9UJkeEHM,28375840,28381120,like jabari because that was the need  there i like the fit and i like the  player just a tad bit better it's a
KNl9UJkeEHM,28381120,28386718,smidge it's a slight smidge but pella  bencaro basketball iq versatile game
KNl9UJkeEHM,28386718,28393760,really can do everything well and at  that forward spot can really score from  all three levels philadelphia 76ers they
KNl9UJkeEHM,28393760,28401200,didn't do anything no draft picks they  traded away um danny green  and they were able to get a nice little
KNl9UJkeEHM,28401200,28406398,acquisition and d'anthony melton who's  going to be a scorer off the bench but  they didn't make any picks so no grade
KNl9UJkeEHM,28406398,28413600,there same can be said for the phoenix  suns no grade for the suns because they  didn't make any selections either uh
KNl9UJkeEHM,28413600,28420160,either excuse me so you can rip me in  the comments you can let me know what  you think about what i did
KNl9UJkeEHM,28420160,28426000,let me know what you think i did with  these draft grades portland trailblazers  here shane sharp at number seven i love
KNl9UJkeEHM,28426000,28431040,the pick there are so many unknowns  about this kid he reclassified was the  number one high school recruit
KNl9UJkeEHM,28431040,28436478,originally went to college early  enrolled at kentucky in january
KNl9UJkeEHM,28436478,28443520,has bradley bill jalen green scoring  ability jabari walker 57 ford out of  colorado good player who sometimes got
KNl9UJkeEHM,28443520,28449760,overshadowed last year shane sharp is  going to be able to learn from damian  lillard i think he's going to be a  walking bucket he's going to be able to
KNl9UJkeEHM,28449760,28455600,put the biscuit in the basket right away  because he can really get a shot off  from anywhere on the floor be great for
KNl9UJkeEHM,28455600,28461040,the portland trailblazers sacramento  kings daughter's a little bit of a reach  going keegan murray here i think they
KNl9UJkeEHM,28461040,28466718,drafted for need  instead of best player available best  player available was jay nivey
KNl9UJkeEHM,28466718,28471760,word is he didn't want to get drafted by  the sacramento kings and there wasn't  much communication there so they go
KNl9UJkeEHM,28471760,28478320,keegan murray who in my opinion is a  more athletic l horford again certainly  fulfills a need there on that sacramento
KNl9UJkeEHM,28478320,28483360,kings roster it's a c-plus though  because i thought it was a little bit of  a reach i do think that he is a polish
KNl9UJkeEHM,28483360,28488558,player san antonio spurs they did some  good stuff here jeremy sohan
KNl9UJkeEHM,28488558,28495040,i think factors into being maybe a  draymond green or a ben simmons at the  fourth type he proves that scoring isn't
KNl9UJkeEHM,28495040,28502080,everything at the nba level malachi  branham the wing out of ohio state at  number 20 blake wesley at number 25
KNl9UJkeEHM,28502080,28508160,three young players who you can build  around all teenagers by the way  who can really help streamline the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28508160,28513440,development the growth and getting the  spurs back to elite level basketball now
KNl9UJkeEHM,28513440,28518958,what happens with greg popovich down the  road we will see i think quinn snyder  will replace him and if he does have
KNl9UJkeEHM,28518958,28525280,some really good young pieces on that  roster toronto raptors made one pick it  was christian koloko 33rd overall for
KNl9UJkeEHM,28525280,28530558,arguably the best shot blocker in this  draft class  really good value there for a guy who i
KNl9UJkeEHM,28530558,28536718,think has a lot of upside and because i  like the pick so much i'm going a grade  for the toronto raptors they've been a
KNl9UJkeEHM,28536718,28542080,player development factory they've done  some terrific things over time i think  they're going to be able to turn
KNl9UJkeEHM,28542080,28548000,christian koloko into a very solid  player what does it do for precious  chachua i'm not really sure but koloko
KNl9UJkeEHM,28548000,28554638,and the drafting of him maybe it takes  him out of the rudy gobert sweepstakes  utah jazz did not make a pick they have
KNl9UJkeEHM,28554638,28561360,a lot of questions with this roster  who's going to be the next head coach  we're not sure are they going to trade  away donovan mitchell rudy gobert we
KNl9UJkeEHM,28561360,28568478,will see not available for that draft  grade last one coming in here washington  wizards johnny davis number 10 overall
KNl9UJkeEHM,28568478,28573520,one of the best scorers in college  basketball last year then unique and  zosa i think it's going to be a draft
KNl9UJkeEHM,28573520,28579200,and stash but for davis let's say that  the war uh the wizards excuse me  they
KNl9UJkeEHM,28579200,28585520,have bradley beal opt-in and he signs  that long-term contract extension  doesn't mean he's going to be there for  the duration of that contract but it
KNl9UJkeEHM,28585520,28591840,means and it signals that they're going  to try to win right now because that's  what bl wants to do johnny davis can  allow them to do that was one of the
KNl9UJkeEHM,28591840,28597600,best scores in college basketball last  year and a very good defender as well  giving the washington wizards some
KNl9UJkeEHM,28597600,28603680,people call them the wizards a b  grade so that does it for our 2022 nba
KNl9UJkeEHM,28603680,28609120,draft grades who will be the best player  from this draft class let me know and
KNl9UJkeEHM,28609120,28615040,again let me know how i did with the  draft grades some people are gonna love  me some people will hate me but it's all
