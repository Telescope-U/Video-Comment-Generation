01oB5fkT_-Y,400,1400,Oh. Hang on.
01oB5fkT_-Y,2080,4359,On. There we go.
01oB5fkT_-Y,4440,6880,She doesn't like penis and vagina graffiti.
01oB5fkT_-Y,6960,7960,Don't know why I'm so shocked
01oB5fkT_-Y,8040,9320,that none of the dresses fit.
01oB5fkT_-Y,10560,11400,Action.
01oB5fkT_-Y,12800,14000,It's...
01oB5fkT_-Y,17440,18280,Hi.
01oB5fkT_-Y,19200,22800,"Hello. Welcome to Moordale for our set tour,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,22880,24840,a special pulling back of the curtain.
01oB5fkT_-Y,24920,26360,I'm gonna to be presenting and directing
01oB5fkT_-Y,26440,27400,the entire endeavor.
01oB5fkT_-Y,27480,29000,"You're supposed to yell ""cut""."
01oB5fkT_-Y,30400,33000,Cut. Cut. Cut.
01oB5fkT_-Y,33480,34320,Cut it!
01oB5fkT_-Y,35760,36879,There flies the flag
01oB5fkT_-Y,37600,39800,over the iconic Moordale building.
01oB5fkT_-Y,40720,41760,The school values.
01oB5fkT_-Y,41840,43600,"Urgh, don't worry about those."
01oB5fkT_-Y,43680,46440,"So this used to be a university gym,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,46520,49160,but we have made it our own little bit of Hollywood.
01oB5fkT_-Y,49240,51480,These are all interior sets
01oB5fkT_-Y,51560,54040,so that's the outside of Jean's house.
01oB5fkT_-Y,54120,54960,And Otis's house.
01oB5fkT_-Y,55040,56600,-Al? -Yeah?
01oB5fkT_-Y,56680,57920,-Hello. -Hello.
01oB5fkT_-Y,58000,60760,"-Well, hello. -Hi. Fancy seeing you here."
01oB5fkT_-Y,60840,62320,Tell me where we are now.
01oB5fkT_-Y,62400,64720,"We are in Moordale's most iconic,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,64800,66600,most fa-moos corridor.
01oB5fkT_-Y,66680,68000,"Well, it's not that iconic this year"
01oB5fkT_-Y,68080,70440,because all of the graffiti has gone.
01oB5fkT_-Y,70520,71560,Why's it been painted?
01oB5fkT_-Y,71640,73560,"We've got a new monarch, as you know."
01oB5fkT_-Y,73640,74880,"Who, pray tell, is that?"
01oB5fkT_-Y,74960,76600,It's Hope Haddon.
01oB5fkT_-Y,76680,78480,Who's she? Who's she played by?
01oB5fkT_-Y,78560,81079,-Jemima Kirke. -She's the new head person?
01oB5fkT_-Y,81160,82360,She's the new head person.
01oB5fkT_-Y,82440,84840,And she doesn't like penis and vagina graffiti.
01oB5fkT_-Y,84920,86600,Let's be a team player.
01oB5fkT_-Y,86680,88200,Done lots of scenes in this corridor?
01oB5fkT_-Y,88280,89119,Lots.
01oB5fkT_-Y,89200,91840,There's a bit of post masturbation crumpet
01oB5fkT_-Y,91920,93920,-up in here. -Like in all night.
01oB5fkT_-Y,94000,95160,I've had two packets of crumpets...
01oB5fkT_-Y,95240,97280,-Think my clit may drop off. -Ring any bells?
01oB5fkT_-Y,97360,98280,Two packets? One?
01oB5fkT_-Y,98360,100360,-I do a double here... -Yes.
01oB5fkT_-Y,100440,102000,-...at some point. -The iconic...
01oB5fkT_-Y,102080,103040,That is huge.
01oB5fkT_-Y,103120,104400,-Ready? -And action.
01oB5fkT_-Y,105200,106039,Cut.
01oB5fkT_-Y,106120,107360,Do you think that the writers
01oB5fkT_-Y,107440,108960,are now writing for you both
01oB5fkT_-Y,109040,110280,because you have such a lovely relationship
01oB5fkT_-Y,110360,111400,in the real of life?
01oB5fkT_-Y,111480,113520,That's a good question. Probably. I hope so.
01oB5fkT_-Y,113600,116400,I do think a lot of our real life...
01oB5fkT_-Y,116480,117760,-Idiosyncrasies. -...yes...
01oB5fkT_-Y,117840,119600,-They've made it. -...have blended into the
01oB5fkT_-Y,119680,121880,-Maeve and Aimee tapestry. -The Maemee.
01oB5fkT_-Y,121960,124280,"'Cause you seem to finish each other's sentences,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,124360,126240,which makes me feel warm and gooey inside.
01oB5fkT_-Y,127320,130440,"Think on a good day it might be really sweet,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,130520,132920,"and then sometimes, it doesn't stop."
01oB5fkT_-Y,133000,134320,I think we're quite annoying.
01oB5fkT_-Y,134400,135480,-You know... -I know...
01oB5fkT_-Y,136720,139520,"I got scared, Mr Groff."
01oB5fkT_-Y,139600,140960,Cand we see your locker?
01oB5fkT_-Y,141040,143519,-Of course you can. -Is that 122?
01oB5fkT_-Y,143600,145040,"If you could choose any number on the planet,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,145120,147200,-what would it be? -Number one.
01oB5fkT_-Y,147720,149360,-That's my girl. -Of course.
01oB5fkT_-Y,149440,151160,A Kilo sale advert
01oB5fkT_-Y,151240,152400,"which probably makes a lot of sense,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,152480,153440,"vintage clothing,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,153520,155440,which is very important to Aimee.
01oB5fkT_-Y,155520,158400,Her notebook is 70s...
01oB5fkT_-Y,158480,160280,"Look, a cake sale."
01oB5fkT_-Y,160880,162920,Aimee's made some vulva cupcakes this year.
01oB5fkT_-Y,163000,163920,Right off you go.
01oB5fkT_-Y,164000,165640,-Bye. Bye. -I hope to be back--
01oB5fkT_-Y,165720,166760,Hope to welcome you back soon.
01oB5fkT_-Y,166840,168000,Great!
01oB5fkT_-Y,170800,174000,"So, I'm now standing outside the iconic old part"
01oB5fkT_-Y,174080,174920,"of Moordale,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,175000,178120,which has made up of very old brick
01oB5fkT_-Y,178200,179360,and it has windows.
01oB5fkT_-Y,179440,180720,Look at that maintenance.
01oB5fkT_-Y,180800,182480,"-We're over here! -Ah, great."
01oB5fkT_-Y,182560,185239,We have Mimi and Sami
01oB5fkT_-Y,185320,188320,who obviously play Raheem and Ruby.
01oB5fkT_-Y,188400,190840,Two burgeoning iconic characters of the show.
01oB5fkT_-Y,190920,193680,"Mimi, you are considered queen of the untouchables."
01oB5fkT_-Y,193760,195159,But I'm a lot nicer.
01oB5fkT_-Y,195240,196840,Yes. A lot nicer in real life.
01oB5fkT_-Y,196920,199040,But it's fun to be a bitch.
01oB5fkT_-Y,199120,199959,Is it really?
01oB5fkT_-Y,200040,201239,-Yeah. -Might have to try that.
01oB5fkT_-Y,201320,202760,You take that into real life or not at all?
01oB5fkT_-Y,202840,204160,-Never. No. -Never.
01oB5fkT_-Y,204240,206000,"Sami, you look like you might."
01oB5fkT_-Y,206760,209439,I do and it's not a secret. I don't care.
01oB5fkT_-Y,209520,210360,Also very famous
01oB5fkT_-Y,210440,212640,for having your own personal untouchable bench.
01oB5fkT_-Y,212720,213560,I'll show you.
01oB5fkT_-Y,213640,215200,If you wanted to join the untouchables
01oB5fkT_-Y,215280,217160,"and become a part of this bench existence,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,217240,219120,"how would I do that, for example?"
01oB5fkT_-Y,219200,220160,Don't think you can.
01oB5fkT_-Y,220240,222360,is there a scene you've filmed on this bench
01oB5fkT_-Y,222440,223320,that we might hear?
01oB5fkT_-Y,223400,224840,I've walked away from the bench.
01oB5fkT_-Y,224920,225880,In a huff.
01oB5fkT_-Y,227200,228040,It's...
01oB5fkT_-Y,228840,229720,"-Oh, so… -That's it."
01oB5fkT_-Y,229800,231160,"-All done with a look? -It's standing up,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,231240,232760,"-so it's... -Standing up, then..."
01oB5fkT_-Y,232840,233800,-like a... -Yeah.
01oB5fkT_-Y,233880,235760,-Oh! -OT!
01oB5fkT_-Y,236440,238280,-Bag. -It's quite intimidating.
01oB5fkT_-Y,238360,241960,Actually broke up with me on this bench...
01oB5fkT_-Y,242040,243920,"-Oh, right? -...so it's quite..."
01oB5fkT_-Y,244000,246400,So this represents trauma for you.
01oB5fkT_-Y,246480,247319,Yeah.
01oB5fkT_-Y,248200,249000,"He can hold your hand,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,249080,250480,but not sure he can catch you.
01oB5fkT_-Y,251320,253440,"If you wanna cry, you really… It's okay."
01oB5fkT_-Y,254400,256519,I moved on. It's okay.
01oB5fkT_-Y,257400,259560,What's so great about the position of this bench
01oB5fkT_-Y,259640,260520,in relation to the school?
01oB5fkT_-Y,260600,262440,Is it because you see everything happening
01oB5fkT_-Y,262520,264479,-or... -So everyone can see you.
01oB5fkT_-Y,264560,266840,"Oh, right. About people seeing you,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,266920,268200,not you seeing everyone else.
01oB5fkT_-Y,268280,269520,-Exactly. -Yeah.
01oB5fkT_-Y,269600,273960,"Thank you for having me, us, to witness your, yes, bench."
01oB5fkT_-Y,274040,274880,You're amazing.
01oB5fkT_-Y,274960,276160,Can we just keep walking away
01oB5fkT_-Y,276240,277560,from those people please?
01oB5fkT_-Y,277640,278720,That's the bike rack.
01oB5fkT_-Y,278800,281000,That's where Eric and Otis parked their bikes.
01oB5fkT_-Y,282040,283000,Bikes.
01oB5fkT_-Y,285240,288080,Costume. Let's see who's in here.
01oB5fkT_-Y,288160,289840,Obviously this is a formal costume fitting.
01oB5fkT_-Y,289920,292080,"What you don't know is that Connor Swindles,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,292160,293040,"who plays my son, Adam,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,293120,296240,"is show's costume designer, Ameritas,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,296320,298680,and George Robinson here who obviously plays Isaac.
01oB5fkT_-Y,298760,301120,"Connor, you're giving us a nice tour of your jacket,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,301200,304600,which is very much Adam's signature look.
01oB5fkT_-Y,304680,305800,"Obviously,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,305880,306960,playing in the Costume Department
01oB5fkT_-Y,307040,307880,is quite fun.
01oB5fkT_-Y,307960,309360,Anything else caught your eye?
01oB5fkT_-Y,309440,311040,Green is very much your colour.
01oB5fkT_-Y,311120,312000,Did you choose that
01oB5fkT_-Y,312080,313800,because it makes your eyes pop?
01oB5fkT_-Y,313880,315120,-Yes. -Yes.
01oB5fkT_-Y,315200,317400,Rosa is obviously the costume designer.
01oB5fkT_-Y,317480,319040,I remember when I first started talking
01oB5fkT_-Y,319120,319960,"about the show,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,320040,322360,I assumed everyone would be in a school uniform.
01oB5fkT_-Y,322440,323680,That's very much not the case.
01oB5fkT_-Y,323760,325000,If you have a lot to do with
01oB5fkT_-Y,325080,327240,"your own sort of costume styles, the pair of you?"
01oB5fkT_-Y,327320,328760,I liked the jacket with Adam
01oB5fkT_-Y,328840,332000,"because it had that sort of hard shell,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,333400,335240,-soft interior. -For Isaac.
01oB5fkT_-Y,335320,339600,One of them was full on velour tracksuit.
01oB5fkT_-Y,339680,341520,Why was that vetoed? It sounds wonderful.
01oB5fkT_-Y,341600,343960,"At the day, I think that's what we all strive for,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,344040,345520,is to be taken seriously as artists.
01oB5fkT_-Y,345600,347240,"And I thought velour tracksuit,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,347320,349080,kinda take away from that.
01oB5fkT_-Y,349160,350880,And does it help being taken seriously
01oB5fkT_-Y,350960,352919,if you have a cock and balls on your head?
01oB5fkT_-Y,353000,353880,Usually. Yeah.
01oB5fkT_-Y,353960,355680,"I remember Robert De Niro,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,355760,359000,I had some of the costumes he used in Raging Bull.
01oB5fkT_-Y,359080,360840,It was called Raging Balls
01oB5fkT_-Y,360920,362400,and then they changed it to Raging Bull.
01oB5fkT_-Y,362480,363880,"Connor, do you have anything else to show us?"
01oB5fkT_-Y,363960,364800,"Leave me be,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,364880,365840,keep asking George questions.
01oB5fkT_-Y,365920,368760,You copped quite a lot of online grief.
01oB5fkT_-Y,368840,370199,How was that living through?
01oB5fkT_-Y,370280,371920,They thought I was convincing enough
01oB5fkT_-Y,372000,374080,as a sarcastic bell-end.
01oB5fkT_-Y,374160,376000,"-Yeah, so... -So typecast again."
01oB5fkT_-Y,376080,378360,-You're not... -No.
01oB5fkT_-Y,378440,379400,Don't know why I'm so shocked
01oB5fkT_-Y,379480,381000,that none of the dresses fit.
01oB5fkT_-Y,381080,383000,I'm now fully naked.
01oB5fkT_-Y,385960,388160,"-Where are we now, Connor? -The English classroom."
01oB5fkT_-Y,388240,392680,What's Adam like at school? Is he a good pupil?
01oB5fkT_-Y,392760,395680,-I think he's quite shit... -Is he?
01oB5fkT_-Y,396440,397400,...as a student
01oB5fkT_-Y,397480,399280,And what was Connor like at school?
01oB5fkT_-Y,399360,401080,-Quite shit as a student. -Really?
01oB5fkT_-Y,401160,403200,I was all right at school.
01oB5fkT_-Y,403280,404560,"You're a very good artist, we know."
01oB5fkT_-Y,404640,406960,The cast are very lucky and the crew are very lucky
01oB5fkT_-Y,407040,408880,to have one of your magnificent posters.
01oB5fkT_-Y,408960,411520,"People think that I'm more of an expressionists,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,411600,412600,but I was actually
01oB5fkT_-Y,412680,414400,trying to make them photo realistic.
01oB5fkT_-Y,414480,418000,"So, you describe your work as impressionistic,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,418080,421199,"wannabe photo realistic, a bit shit."
01oB5fkT_-Y,421280,422200,But that's part of the charm.
01oB5fkT_-Y,422280,424120,"George, what you reckon? Gonna reach the window?"
01oB5fkT_-Y,424200,427680,"I reckon, I'm saying third row."
01oB5fkT_-Y,430320,431600,-First row. -Good.
01oB5fkT_-Y,431680,433000,Back outside the modern section
01oB5fkT_-Y,433080,435919,"of Moordale, there is our emblem,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,436000,438000,"very proud of that, and the bleachers,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,438080,439800,which overlook our extensive sporting--
01oB5fkT_-Y,439880,441880,"-Hey, Al! -Hello, Patricia."
01oB5fkT_-Y,444480,446200,"We're going to Sixth Form common room,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,446280,448080,"-you want to come? -I'd love to, yeah."
01oB5fkT_-Y,448160,449000,Great. Okay.
01oB5fkT_-Y,451880,453240,-This is the common room? -Yes!
01oB5fkT_-Y,453320,455240,Who spends most of their time in here?
01oB5fkT_-Y,455320,456640,Me and Kedar.
01oB5fkT_-Y,456720,459160,"We're always playing ping pong, I guess."
01oB5fkT_-Y,459240,460360,-You and Kedar... -And we're very good.
01oB5fkT_-Y,460440,464200,"There is a scene that Ncuti and Asa shot,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,464280,466120,where they were sat by the window
01oB5fkT_-Y,466200,467360,and I walk past.
01oB5fkT_-Y,467440,468800,-That's right. -Asa is like...
01oB5fkT_-Y,468880,470080,No...
01oB5fkT_-Y,471880,473960,"-Chine, you're head girl. -I am."
01oB5fkT_-Y,474040,475040,How did that come about?
01oB5fkT_-Y,475120,476240,"Hope being head girl,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,476320,477840,and I always try and think
01oB5fkT_-Y,477920,479480,what would Michelle Obama do...
01oB5fkT_-Y,479560,481200,-Really? -...when I'm acting.
01oB5fkT_-Y,481280,483160,"-So, hopefully... -She's your inspiration."
01oB5fkT_-Y,483240,484080,...she's my inspiration.
01oB5fkT_-Y,484160,485280,"Just in terms of your characters,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,485360,489000,how've they sort of morphed and moved on from season 2?
01oB5fkT_-Y,490080,491039,I guess we're gay now.
01oB5fkT_-Y,491120,493120,Yeah. And I think this year
01oB5fkT_-Y,493200,495120,we've been discovering
01oB5fkT_-Y,495200,496760,what our characters are really like
01oB5fkT_-Y,496840,498280,in a relationship.
01oB5fkT_-Y,498360,500280,And does it-- Asa get in here!
01oB5fkT_-Y,502000,504240,Hey!
01oB5fkT_-Y,504320,506520,What were you doing? Walking around on set?
01oB5fkT_-Y,506600,507520,I was bored
01oB5fkT_-Y,507600,509200,"and so, I went to just wonder around."
01oB5fkT_-Y,509280,511920,If you weren't doing this what would you be doing?
01oB5fkT_-Y,512000,514120,In your trailer? Would you be doing a scene?
01oB5fkT_-Y,514200,515160,Nothing. -Many things.
01oB5fkT_-Y,515240,516919,-Many possible things? -Really? Like what?
01oB5fkT_-Y,517000,519400,What does Asa Butterfield do when he's not on set?
01oB5fkT_-Y,519479,522839,I might be in my trailer.
01oB5fkT_-Y,522919,524120,Yeah.
01oB5fkT_-Y,524200,526560,I might be throwing some Frisbee around.
01oB5fkT_-Y,526640,528480,We've a little Frisbee session going on.
01oB5fkT_-Y,528560,530480,Do any of you play ping pong?
01oB5fkT_-Y,530560,531560,Yes.
01oB5fkT_-Y,531640,533480,Would anyone like to have a game?
01oB5fkT_-Y,533560,535400,"-Yes, I'll grab the bats. -You grab the bats."
01oB5fkT_-Y,535480,537240,"-So, I just do that? -Any way you want."
01oB5fkT_-Y,537840,538880,"Oh, my God!"
01oB5fkT_-Y,538960,539800,Good to know
01oB5fkT_-Y,539880,542200,intellectuals in the school are very sporty as well.
01oB5fkT_-Y,543280,544720,I'm so sorry.
01oB5fkT_-Y,544800,546600,Where's your favourite location to film?
01oB5fkT_-Y,546680,547680,Is it at school?
01oB5fkT_-Y,547760,551240,I love Lily's bedroom because it's so naughty.
01oB5fkT_-Y,551880,553600,And there are just willies everywhere.
01oB5fkT_-Y,553680,554600,And bums.
01oB5fkT_-Y,554680,556399,Did you have any say in the design?
01oB5fkT_-Y,556480,557440,No...
01oB5fkT_-Y,558080,562120,But I would love to remodel my own bedroom
01oB5fkT_-Y,562200,563480,in a similar fashion.
01oB5fkT_-Y,563560,564400,Thanks very much
01oB5fkT_-Y,564480,566480,for bringing me back to school.
01oB5fkT_-Y,566560,567520,It's nice to be back.
01oB5fkT_-Y,567600,569319,"Obviously, I haven't been here all year,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,569400,570880,but I will return and try...
01oB5fkT_-Y,570960,572240,-We're leaving now. -See ya!
01oB5fkT_-Y,572800,574279,Me and my camera-- I've got to go. Bye.
01oB5fkT_-Y,574360,576600,"So, thank you all for joining me"
01oB5fkT_-Y,576680,578240,"on this little journey,"
01oB5fkT_-Y,578320,580560,this expose of behind the scenes
01oB5fkT_-Y,580640,582520,at Moordale. Hope you enjoy the season.
01oB5fkT_-Y,585840,588160,"Ah, right. Let's turn this thing..."
01oB5fkT_-Y,589360,590320,There you go. Off.
