6Y-PeuGFaHc,3880,6683,- Conceiving a child is like a giant Powerball.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,7740,10910,"If we think about any two parents,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,10911,15820,there are 70 trillion possible genetic combinations
6Y-PeuGFaHc,15820,18423,that any one of their children could inherit.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,19308,22870,"So siblings are really different from one another,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,22870,26963,"in their education, in their income, even lifespan."
6Y-PeuGFaHc,28070,30823,And genetics is part of the reason why.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,32004,34296,But to study things like genetics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,34296,37630,in relation to education or intelligence
6Y-PeuGFaHc,37630,40128,"or personality, has long been"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,40128,42703,a really controversial area of research.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,43800,46701,"For many people, the idea of genetic differences"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,46701,49220,between us is hard to reconcile
6Y-PeuGFaHc,49220,51373,with what they think of as equality.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,52575,55613,But if we care about inequality that is tied
6Y-PeuGFaHc,55613,58295,"to accidents of people's birth,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,58296,62837,"the kind of stroke of luck over which they have no control,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,62837,65123,"then we should care about genetic inequality,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,66080,68103,because it is one of the major sources
6Y-PeuGFaHc,68103,70083,of inequality in this country.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,71360,72720,My name is Paige Harden.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,72720,74170,I'm a professor of psychology
6Y-PeuGFaHc,74170,76259,at the University of Texas at Austin.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,76260,79370,"And I recently wrote a book called ""The Genetic Lottery:"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,79370,81487,"Why DNA Matters for Social Equality."""
6Y-PeuGFaHc,87706,90317,I think what a lot of people don't realize
6Y-PeuGFaHc,90317,95300,"is that all humans are over 99% genetically the same,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,95300,98420,regardless of their racial group.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,98420,101912,Even those differences don't fall along racial lines.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,103180,106333,So most of our DNA we have in common.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,107463,111399,"That remaining less than 1%, however,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,111400,113946,"is really scientifically interesting,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,113946,117680,"because many of the psychological, behavioral,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,117680,119890,physical differences between us
6Y-PeuGFaHc,119890,122030,are related to that tiny fraction
6Y-PeuGFaHc,122030,124483,of our genome that differs between us.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,125521,128983,How can we figure out which genetic variants
6Y-PeuGFaHc,128983,130710,are associated with some
6Y-PeuGFaHc,130710,133990,of the psychological differences that we care about?
6Y-PeuGFaHc,133990,135790,"Your risk for schizophrenia,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,135790,137730,"your risk for depression,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,137731,139343,how far you go in school.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,141702,144560,I think a big part of the power of genetics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,144560,147392,is as a tool to help us understand the environment.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,148280,151410,"What are the social environments, the school contexts,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,151410,154070,the parenting environments that can turn on
6Y-PeuGFaHc,154070,156313,or turn off genetic risk?
6Y-PeuGFaHc,157305,162069,"So if I'm at genetic risk for doing poorly in school,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,162070,163830,is there something about the school environment
6Y-PeuGFaHc,163830,165950,"that can buffer me against that risk,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,165950,169370,"such that I still go on to do well in my math class,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,169370,173080,such that I still go on to do well in college?
6Y-PeuGFaHc,173080,174663,So we're interested in bringing together
6Y-PeuGFaHc,174663,178010,the biological differences but also an understanding
6Y-PeuGFaHc,178010,180730,of the environment to see how they combine
6Y-PeuGFaHc,180730,182163,to shape children's lives.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,184920,188280,"This work, connecting genetics to things like education,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,188280,190612,continues to be controversial
6Y-PeuGFaHc,190613,193762,because people fear 'eugenics.'
6Y-PeuGFaHc,193762,196719,And that's the idea that genetic differences underlie
6Y-PeuGFaHc,196720,199928,"some natural hierarchy of value,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,199928,202640,and that genetic information should be used
6Y-PeuGFaHc,202640,207453,to sort of slot people into their place or station in life.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,208700,210817,White supremacist groups will be
6Y-PeuGFaHc,210817,213800,eager consumers of genetic research
6Y-PeuGFaHc,213800,216600,in order to justify their narratives
6Y-PeuGFaHc,216600,219889,around biological hierarchy.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,219889,223217,But if scientists that have egalitarian values
6Y-PeuGFaHc,223217,225170,"avoid the topic,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,225170,227220,then the only people who are consuming it and talking
6Y-PeuGFaHc,227220,230503,about what it means are these ideological extremes.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,232000,234760,The predominant response to the eugenic perspective
6Y-PeuGFaHc,234760,238390,has been what I call 'Genome-blindness.'
6Y-PeuGFaHc,238390,241137,And that's really the idea that we should avoid talking
6Y-PeuGFaHc,241137,244903,about biological or genetic differences between people.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,246086,248480,"The fear is that if something's genetic,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,248480,251849,it's natural and there's nothing we can do about it.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,251850,254140,So let's not talk about genetics lest people give up
6Y-PeuGFaHc,254140,256562,on the idea of changing social policy.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,257696,261769,And that doesn't bear out under the science.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,261769,263590,"Things can be influenced by genetics,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,263590,265682,but still responsive to the environment.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,266690,269800,A great example is if you wear eyeglasses.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,269800,272389,"That's something that is genetically-caused,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,272390,274565,that we fix not by CRISPRing your genome
6Y-PeuGFaHc,274565,276803,"or selecting your embryo,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,276803,279860,but by giving you an environmental intervention
6Y-PeuGFaHc,279860,281332,that you wear on your face.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,282930,285070,"So, I think we can think of the antidote"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,285070,287562,"to eugenics not being genome-blindness,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,287562,289743,but being 'anti-eugenics.'
6Y-PeuGFaHc,290800,292310,There's a really great example
6Y-PeuGFaHc,292310,295310,"of anti-eugenic policy in the United States,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,295310,298550,and that's the Americans with Disabilities Act.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,298550,301610,"If you go into an ADA compliant building,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,301610,304097,there has to be an elevator there.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,304097,305530,What's being equalized
6Y-PeuGFaHc,305530,307083,"is not their functioning,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,307980,310140,"so someone might still not be able to walk,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,310140,312690,they might still be in a wheelchair.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,312690,316566,What's being equalized is their ability to participate
6Y-PeuGFaHc,316566,319763,with dignity in a public space.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,321060,323100,"In order to accomplish that,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,323100,326263,you actually have to recognize differences between people.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,327286,328515,What if we took that
6Y-PeuGFaHc,328515,331615,anti-eugenic disability justice perspective
6Y-PeuGFaHc,331615,333573,when we're crafting policies?
6Y-PeuGFaHc,335240,337819,I am an egalitarian.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,337820,340090,I think of social inequality
6Y-PeuGFaHc,340090,343590,as a moral and political problem to be fixed.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,343590,344510,"But at the same time,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,344510,346770,I think that biological differences between us
6Y-PeuGFaHc,346770,349373,are real and make a difference for our lives.
6Y-PeuGFaHc,350468,351763,"I'm out here saying,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,351763,355193,'Science doesn't neatly fit into ideology.'
6Y-PeuGFaHc,356160,359180,"What we need to do is think about what our values are,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,359180,361020,"what does the science say,"
6Y-PeuGFaHc,361020,363069,and then take both of those things seriously
6Y-PeuGFaHc,363070,364553,when we're crafting policies.
