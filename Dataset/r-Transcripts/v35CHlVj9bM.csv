v35CHlVj9bM,160,2639,so i haven't traveled since ces 2020
v35CHlVj9bM,2639,4400,that's over two years okay i haven't
v35CHlVj9bM,4400,5839,been on a plane i haven't been anywhere
v35CHlVj9bM,5839,8360,for work so being invited last week to
v35CHlVj9bM,8360,12000,wwdc 22 in cupertino and being there for
v35CHlVj9bM,12000,14480,the first time was a huge treat it also
v35CHlVj9bM,14480,15920,gave me the opportunity to figure out
v35CHlVj9bM,15920,17359,what i was gonna pack because in the
v35CHlVj9bM,17359,19279,past whenever i traveled for work i'd
v35CHlVj9bM,19279,21760,carry way too much gear this year the
v35CHlVj9bM,21760,24000,goal was to travel as light as possible
v35CHlVj9bM,24000,25760,and only bring the essentials and it
v35CHlVj9bM,25760,27519,worked out perfectly now the bag that
v35CHlVj9bM,27519,29279,i've been using for the past three years
v35CHlVj9bM,29279,30960,is the peak design bag i had the first
v35CHlVj9bM,30960,32880,generation of it and this is the second
v35CHlVj9bM,32880,35360,version of the everyday travel backpack
v35CHlVj9bM,35360,37600,it's been absolutely solid it's great
v35CHlVj9bM,37600,40160,material it's highly water resistant
v35CHlVj9bM,40160,42079,there's tons of storage for example if
v35CHlVj9bM,42079,43840,you open up the top you have a small
v35CHlVj9bM,43840,46079,little compartment over here to place
v35CHlVj9bM,46079,48000,stuff in i just put a mouse pad in there
v35CHlVj9bM,48000,50800,and then you have this big open spot to
v35CHlVj9bM,50800,52960,put whatever you want but if you open up
v35CHlVj9bM,52960,56000,the sides of the bag you have a lot more
v35CHlVj9bM,56000,58320,compartments to utilize you have pockets
v35CHlVj9bM,58320,60640,over here more pockets there they're
v35CHlVj9bM,60640,62559,magnetically attached so it feels good
v35CHlVj9bM,62559,64320,to click in and then you have these
v35CHlVj9bM,64320,66640,little dividers that go throughout the
v35CHlVj9bM,66640,69119,body where you can kind of house camera
v35CHlVj9bM,69119,71360,gear there's a 20 liter version and a 30
v35CHlVj9bM,71360,73520,liter version of this backpack this
v35CHlVj9bM,73520,75759,happens to be the bigger version of it
v35CHlVj9bM,75759,77360,and of course on the other side you have
v35CHlVj9bM,77360,80240,more pockets to utilize and if you plan
v35CHlVj9bM,80240,82560,on carrying a laptop if you open it up
v35CHlVj9bM,82560,85280,from the back you can put a 16 inch
v35CHlVj9bM,85280,87200,laptop over here and then there's
v35CHlVj9bM,87200,89280,another little pocket over here that can
v35CHlVj9bM,89280,91680,house a tablet and then you have a quick
v35CHlVj9bM,91680,93840,access pocket that i use to like put a
v35CHlVj9bM,93840,96159,pen maybe a little bit of advil and a
v35CHlVj9bM,96159,97759,couple of batteries now since we're
v35CHlVj9bM,97759,99520,talking about laptops the one i brought
v35CHlVj9bM,99520,102000,and continuously use is the macbook pro
v35CHlVj9bM,102000,104560,16 m1 pro i hate to say it but this is
v35CHlVj9bM,104560,108079,like the best travel work laptop i've
v35CHlVj9bM,108079,110399,ever used not only is it ridiculously
v35CHlVj9bM,110399,112840,quiet the battery life on this thing was
v35CHlVj9bM,112840,115439,superb i came back from the event i
v35CHlVj9bM,115439,117119,started editing on this i didn't even
v35CHlVj9bM,117119,119119,plug it in by the end of the day i still
v35CHlVj9bM,119119,121439,had like 40 battery life left like this
v35CHlVj9bM,121439,124240,thing is an absolute monster this is the
v35CHlVj9bM,124240,126479,m1 pro not the m1 max and to be quite
v35CHlVj9bM,126479,129039,honest the m1 pro is more than capable
v35CHlVj9bM,129039,130560,for the stuff that i'm doing so don't
v35CHlVj9bM,130560,132879,overpay for the more expensive processor
v35CHlVj9bM,132879,135200,if you're in the video world the m1 pro
v35CHlVj9bM,135200,137040,is more than enough now i never used to
v35CHlVj9bM,137040,139120,travel with an ipad but i didn't realize
v35CHlVj9bM,139120,141360,how much i'd enjoy traveling with the
v35CHlVj9bM,141360,144480,mini the ipad pro or air 10 inch or 12
v35CHlVj9bM,144480,146239,inch is just too big to carry in a
v35CHlVj9bM,146239,149200,backpack full of gear but this is light
v35CHlVj9bM,149200,152000,it's the right size and it acts as three
v35CHlVj9bM,152000,154000,main sources it becomes my content
v35CHlVj9bM,154000,156319,consumption device to watch movies or tv
v35CHlVj9bM,156319,158800,shows i also use it to read books if i
v35CHlVj9bM,158800,160480,ever need to like script something which
v35CHlVj9bM,160480,162480,is very rare i can use this thing but
v35CHlVj9bM,162480,164400,most importantly it also acts as a
v35CHlVj9bM,164400,166319,second display without taking up much
v35CHlVj9bM,166319,168560,space in my bag the great thing though
v35CHlVj9bM,168560,170959,is that it's not the most expensive ipad
v35CHlVj9bM,170959,173040,and i find it to be a good accessory to
v35CHlVj9bM,173040,174959,my workflow so i don't carry the macbook
v35CHlVj9bM,174959,176480,pro charger there's no need to it only
v35CHlVj9bM,176480,178720,charges one device at a time i instead
v35CHlVj9bM,178720,181760,use this 100 watt razer gan charger it
v35CHlVj9bM,181760,183120,was very expensive when it first came
v35CHlVj9bM,183120,185280,out i'm not sure the price now but it's
v35CHlVj9bM,185280,187519,smaller than the macbook pro charger and
v35CHlVj9bM,187519,189680,there's a lot more ports to utilize so
v35CHlVj9bM,189680,191519,i'll connect the magsafe charger to one
v35CHlVj9bM,191519,193440,of these type c ports then i have an
v35CHlVj9bM,193440,195920,extra type c port to play with plus two
v35CHlVj9bM,195920,199200,usb a ports and it just makes traveling
v35CHlVj9bM,199200,201440,less messy since you don't have to carry
v35CHlVj9bM,201440,203280,as many chargers with you now the camera
v35CHlVj9bM,203280,205680,i use is the sony a74 and i use this
v35CHlVj9bM,205680,208159,instead of my sony a7s iii when i travel
v35CHlVj9bM,208159,210400,i love the a7 s3 it's a great video
v35CHlVj9bM,210400,212159,camera but it sucks when it comes to
v35CHlVj9bM,212159,215360,photography the a74 is the best of both
v35CHlVj9bM,215360,217360,worlds you get really good photos and
v35CHlVj9bM,217360,219760,you get really good videos it's a
v35CHlVj9bM,219760,222959,lighter body i don't use this 24 to 70
v35CHlVj9bM,222959,224879,sony g master lens when i travel i
v35CHlVj9bM,224879,227519,actually bring the tamron 17 to 28
v35CHlVj9bM,227519,229840,millimeter lens it's my top down lens
v35CHlVj9bM,229840,231920,that i use here in the studio it's not
v35CHlVj9bM,231920,234959,metal so it's lighter it's significantly
v35CHlVj9bM,234959,237439,smaller it's just easier to travel with
v35CHlVj9bM,237439,240319,and the wider the focal range you have
v35CHlVj9bM,240319,242400,the easier it is to stabilize when
v35CHlVj9bM,242400,244640,you're holding it with your hands on top
v35CHlVj9bM,244640,247040,of this camera i have a small rig camera
v35CHlVj9bM,247040,249439,cage to keep it protected plus it allows
v35CHlVj9bM,249439,251280,me to connect more things to it now for
v35CHlVj9bM,251280,254159,external storage i use a sandisk extreme
v35CHlVj9bM,254159,255920,drive i show this in one of my previous
v35CHlVj9bM,255920,257919,videos but this is the four terabyte
v35CHlVj9bM,257919,259600,version but obviously there's cheaper
v35CHlVj9bM,259600,261519,smaller versions of this if you don't
v35CHlVj9bM,261519,263840,need that much storage but it's a solid
v35CHlVj9bM,263840,265759,product it's very durable there's a bit
v35CHlVj9bM,265759,267680,of water resistance you have this little
v35CHlVj9bM,267680,270000,keyhole so you can attach it to items or
v35CHlVj9bM,270000,272400,keys obviously and the read and write
v35CHlVj9bM,272400,275120,speeds are very good there's an nvme ssd
v35CHlVj9bM,275120,276720,inside of here so scrubbing through
v35CHlVj9bM,276720,278960,footage is nice and smooth now on my
v35CHlVj9bM,278960,281360,previous trip i did use the air pods max
v35CHlVj9bM,281360,282960,they're fantastic headphones they are a
v35CHlVj9bM,282960,285680,bit expensive but they sound incredible
v35CHlVj9bM,285680,287680,the only thing i did not like about them
v35CHlVj9bM,287680,290080,is they don't come with a headphone jack
v35CHlVj9bM,290080,291600,you have to go out and buy a special
v35CHlVj9bM,291600,294160,cable for it and that won't even work
v35CHlVj9bM,294160,296960,unless the headphones are charged i just
v35CHlVj9bM,296960,299360,got the xm5s in and hands down these are
v35CHlVj9bM,299360,301440,going to be my go-to travel headphones
v35CHlVj9bM,301440,303360,going forward not only is the sound
v35CHlVj9bM,303360,305919,quality almost as good if not pretty
v35CHlVj9bM,305919,307680,much close because you can
v35CHlVj9bM,307680,309600,fine-tune the equalization settings the
v35CHlVj9bM,309600,311919,active noise cancellation is top-notch
v35CHlVj9bM,311919,314000,it has a good transparency mode maybe
v35CHlVj9bM,314000,315600,slightly worse than the airpods max but
v35CHlVj9bM,315600,318479,not by much and there's a headphone jack
v35CHlVj9bM,318479,321440,like if these things die i can connect a
v35CHlVj9bM,321440,324000,cable to the headphone jack and continue
v35CHlVj9bM,324000,326320,to use it on the plane plus when i'm
v35CHlVj9bM,326320,328960,wearing these things for like six hours
v35CHlVj9bM,328960,331120,straight you barely feel them they're
v35CHlVj9bM,331120,333680,just so light and cushiony compared to
v35CHlVj9bM,333680,336080,anything else i've put on my mug so a
v35CHlVj9bM,336080,337520,couple you guys asked me about my
v35CHlVj9bM,337520,338560,sunglasses
v35CHlVj9bM,338560,340800,and i don't buy expensive sunglasses
v35CHlVj9bM,340800,342800,because straight up i am an ape i will
v35CHlVj9bM,342800,344720,sit on them i will forget them i will
v35CHlVj9bM,344720,347199,break them so i found these really
v35CHlVj9bM,347199,349199,awesome 23
v35CHlVj9bM,349199,351600,sunglasses on amazon it has good uv
v35CHlVj9bM,351600,353280,protection the kicker is it actually
v35CHlVj9bM,353280,355440,comes with two or three in the pack so
v35CHlVj9bM,355440,356720,if you lose one you don't have to feel
v35CHlVj9bM,356720,358639,bad about it you still got two more to
v35CHlVj9bM,358639,360960,go through and they've lasted like i've
v35CHlVj9bM,360960,362800,been using these things they haven't
v35CHlVj9bM,362800,365120,broke they look good they look like
v35CHlVj9bM,365120,367440,ray-bans at least a little bit and if i
v35CHlVj9bM,367440,369039,forget them somewhere i'm not going to
v35CHlVj9bM,369039,371759,feel guilty now this is something every
v35CHlVj9bM,371759,373680,guy should have and no this is not
v35CHlVj9bM,373680,375120,something you shove in places you
v35CHlVj9bM,375120,376960,shouldn't what it can do is keep you
v35CHlVj9bM,376960,378800,groomed maybe you got a long nose hair
v35CHlVj9bM,378800,381520,or eyebrow hair or maybe you have hair
v35CHlVj9bM,381520,383440,growing out of your ears and connecting
v35CHlVj9bM,383440,384639,to your beard
v35CHlVj9bM,384639,386880,this will keep you groomed i should also
v35CHlVj9bM,386880,389199,mention i do carry the air pods too not
v35CHlVj9bM,389199,391360,the pros but the twos because i like the
v35CHlVj9bM,391360,393280,way they fit in my ear better than the
v35CHlVj9bM,393280,395280,pros i use these mostly for let's say
v35CHlVj9bM,395280,397360,i'm editing in a room or if i want to go
v35CHlVj9bM,397360,399520,for a run or work out the gym they just
v35CHlVj9bM,399520,401199,kind of hang out my bag and are there
v35CHlVj9bM,401199,402720,when i need them now i'm a big fan of
v35CHlVj9bM,402720,404160,the apple watch i literally wear this
v35CHlVj9bM,404160,405840,thing every day it comes with me when i
v35CHlVj9bM,405840,408000,travel and the beauty about it is that
v35CHlVj9bM,408000,409759,it's the cellular version so when i go
v35CHlVj9bM,409759,411599,for a run or go to the gym i don't bring
v35CHlVj9bM,411599,414400,my phone i just use my watch and it's 1
v35CHlVj9bM,414400,416479,000 times more liberating than have to
v35CHlVj9bM,416479,418400,carry a phone in your pocket especially
v35CHlVj9bM,418400,419280,when you're running because it just
v35CHlVj9bM,419280,420960,jiggles everywhere and it doesn't feel
v35CHlVj9bM,420960,423520,good the mouse is still the logitech
v35CHlVj9bM,423520,425280,g305 i've been using this thing for
v35CHlVj9bM,425280,427360,years it hasn't broken down yet it's a
v35CHlVj9bM,427360,430400,solid device you have one battery right
v35CHlVj9bM,430400,432000,here a double a and then of course you
v35CHlVj9bM,432000,434160,have your dongle which stores nice and
v35CHlVj9bM,434160,436560,neatly inside of the mouse the only
v35CHlVj9bM,436560,438639,downfall to this mouse is that it does
v35CHlVj9bM,438639,441280,not support bluetooth if you ever need
v35CHlVj9bM,441280,443039,it but as long as you have the dongle
v35CHlVj9bM,443039,444400,you can pretty much connect it to any
v35CHlVj9bM,444400,447039,computer and it feels and runs
v35CHlVj9bM,447039,448960,fantastically i almost forgot to talk
v35CHlVj9bM,448960,450240,about the phone that i carry and it's
v35CHlVj9bM,450240,453440,mostly the iphone 13 pro and i like the
v35CHlVj9bM,453440,456240,size it's pocketable it's been solid the
v35CHlVj9bM,456240,458160,battery life is never an issue like no
v35CHlVj9bM,458160,459840,problem getting through the entire day
v35CHlVj9bM,459840,462400,especially during wwdc when i was taking
v35CHlVj9bM,462400,464879,a lot of video i also realized how much
v35CHlVj9bM,464879,467919,i rely on this thing when i shoot video
v35CHlVj9bM,467919,470720,it takes supplemental video for my main
v35CHlVj9bM,470720,472960,camera and the color science and the way
v35CHlVj9bM,472960,475120,it looks is incredible there are some
v35CHlVj9bM,475120,477919,shots in my video you can't tell the
v35CHlVj9bM,477919,479199,difference between my professional
v35CHlVj9bM,479199,480960,camera or this guy as long as the
v35CHlVj9bM,480960,483680,lighting is optimal this thing does a
v35CHlVj9bM,483680,487120,fantastic job now i do carry a case i
v35CHlVj9bM,487120,488560,really don't want to carry one i want to
v35CHlVj9bM,488560,490319,be one of those guys that don't but i'm
v35CHlVj9bM,490319,493039,too afraid okay i'm too afraid and it's
v35CHlVj9bM,493039,495680,the apple leather case this is kind of
v35CHlVj9bM,495680,498319,how it looks after what eight months
v35CHlVj9bM,498319,500720,it's starting to rip over here
v35CHlVj9bM,500720,503199,bend over here it does look a lot more
v35CHlVj9bM,503199,504879,vintage because the leather has been
v35CHlVj9bM,504879,507599,worked in overall the apple oh here you
v35CHlVj9bM,507599,509759,go it's cracking never mind overall the
v35CHlVj9bM,509759,512159,quality of these cases are mediocre like
v35CHlVj9bM,512159,514080,my wife has one of these cases and it's
v35CHlVj9bM,514080,516240,completely destroyed like it's peeling
v35CHlVj9bM,516240,518159,all over the place i'll probably not buy
v35CHlVj9bM,518159,520080,another one of these but this will give
v35CHlVj9bM,520080,522240,you an idea of how it looks after a
v35CHlVj9bM,522240,524399,solid eight months now i stopped
v35CHlVj9bM,524399,527279,carrying a pocket wallet if that makes
v35CHlVj9bM,527279,529279,any sense and i used to hate this thing
v35CHlVj9bM,529279,531440,like literally hate the apple wallet i
v35CHlVj9bM,531440,533279,thought it was just a dumb idea but ever
v35CHlVj9bM,533279,535519,since the max 8 version came out i gave
v35CHlVj9bM,535519,537760,it another shot and i lose things a lot
v35CHlVj9bM,537760,539120,so knowing when my wallet is
v35CHlVj9bM,539120,540959,disconnected from my phone
v35CHlVj9bM,540959,543760,is a huge advantage for me plus it
v35CHlVj9bM,543760,545839,allows me to only carry three cards so
v35CHlVj9bM,545839,547360,i'll carry my license and maybe two
v35CHlVj9bM,547360,549519,credit cards and it just keeps it
v35CHlVj9bM,549519,551680,connected to my wallet all the time so i
v35CHlVj9bM,551680,553920,don't have to have two separate objects
v35CHlVj9bM,553920,557200,in my pocket the only thing i wish was
v35CHlVj9bM,557200,559680,the ability to put one extra card but
v35CHlVj9bM,559680,561279,there's also a few other little features
