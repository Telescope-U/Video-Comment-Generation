T0nChz6ph0s,719,3439,it's monochrome i'll take a word for it
T0nChz6ph0s,3439,6480,sex education is the best teenage show
T0nChz6ph0s,6480,8480,of the last decade now i know it's a
T0nChz6ph0s,8480,10480,bold statement and i can already see
T0nChz6ph0s,10480,12240,some of you coming at me in the comments
T0nChz6ph0s,12240,14559,to tell me that euphoria or some other
T0nChz6ph0s,14559,16160,show you're watching is better
T0nChz6ph0s,16160,19520,or whatever and i hear you but i also
T0nChz6ph0s,19520,20160,don't care
T0nChz6ph0s,20160,22800,because sex education in my opinion is a
T0nChz6ph0s,22800,24720,show that is pretty close to
T0nChz6ph0s,24720,26480,perfect now i don't like using the word
T0nChz6ph0s,26480,28480,masterpiece mostly because people
T0nChz6ph0s,28480,30320,nowadays throw this word around way too
T0nChz6ph0s,30320,30880,easily
T0nChz6ph0s,30880,32960,but this might be an occasion where i
T0nChz6ph0s,32960,35040,think the use of the term is warranted
T0nChz6ph0s,35040,36960,sex education is a show that does what
T0nChz6ph0s,36960,38239,most teen dramas
T0nChz6ph0s,38239,40480,fail to do especially the american ones
T0nChz6ph0s,40480,42719,i mean for one thing it has good writing
T0nChz6ph0s,42719,44960,good acting it's intelligent and it
T0nChz6ph0s,44960,46960,doesn't excessively rely on its cast
T0nChz6ph0s,46960,48320,being good looking like
T0nChz6ph0s,48320,50960,american shows do like i get it archie
T0nChz6ph0s,50960,53120,is hot can you tell a story now and a
T0nChz6ph0s,53120,54719,lot of teenage dramas nowadays
T0nChz6ph0s,54719,56879,miserably try to force woke messages on
T0nChz6ph0s,56879,58480,the audience and they do it in a way
T0nChz6ph0s,58480,60879,that's just really lazy and disingenuous
T0nChz6ph0s,60879,62640,i talked about it in my supergirl video
T0nChz6ph0s,62640,64320,like sometimes it's so excessive that
T0nChz6ph0s,64320,66080,even when you agree with the message
T0nChz6ph0s,66080,67760,that's being portrayed on screen it's
T0nChz6ph0s,67760,70000,still annoying to watch but this show
T0nChz6ph0s,70000,71920,is not like that sex education is a
T0nChz6ph0s,71920,73600,series that i mostly appreciate for
T0nChz6ph0s,73600,75520,treating the audience with intelligence
T0nChz6ph0s,75520,77200,and respect and that's when it comes to
T0nChz6ph0s,77200,78799,the messages the story
T0nChz6ph0s,78799,80640,and the character it has quite a lot to
T0nChz6ph0s,80640,82479,say as a show but it manages to do it in
T0nChz6ph0s,82479,84000,a way that never impacts the story
T0nChz6ph0s,84000,85920,negatively and never feels like the
T0nChz6ph0s,85920,87759,writers are talking down to the audience
T0nChz6ph0s,87759,89360,or treating them like idiots i really
T0nChz6ph0s,89360,91119,like that it treats diversity as a
T0nChz6ph0s,91119,91680,normal
T0nChz6ph0s,91680,93920,thing whether it be racial diversity
T0nChz6ph0s,93920,96000,sexual diversity or anything like that
T0nChz6ph0s,96000,98000,like if you have a gay couple on screen
T0nChz6ph0s,98000,99439,they don't feel the need to have
T0nChz6ph0s,99439,102240,multiple characters discuss out loud how
T0nChz6ph0s,102240,103920,they're a gay couple and the gay
T0nChz6ph0s,103920,105840,characters in question are not stuck in
T0nChz6ph0s,105840,107840,storylines about them being gay they're
T0nChz6ph0s,107840,109759,allowed to be real characters with
T0nChz6ph0s,109759,111920,layers and realistic circumstances that
T0nChz6ph0s,111920,113680,are beyond their sexuality black
T0nChz6ph0s,113680,115520,characters also get to just be
T0nChz6ph0s,115520,117040,characters without having to be
T0nChz6ph0s,117040,118880,acknowledged by the writers only if they
T0nChz6ph0s,118880,120799,feel like talking about racism like
T0nChz6ph0s,120799,122159,they're allowed to be fleshed out
T0nChz6ph0s,122159,123759,characters beyond the color of their
T0nChz6ph0s,123759,125680,skin it's almost like people of color
T0nChz6ph0s,125680,126880,are human beings too
T0nChz6ph0s,126880,128080,who would have thought the show just
T0nChz6ph0s,128080,129440,handles all of the woke stuff
T0nChz6ph0s,129440,131200,intelligently and i think that's pretty
T0nChz6ph0s,131200,133520,cool because it proves to american tv
T0nChz6ph0s,133520,135599,properties that they could do it too if
T0nChz6ph0s,135599,137520,they weren't so [ __ ] lazy in their
T0nChz6ph0s,137520,138160,approach
T0nChz6ph0s,138160,140239,yes i'm looking at you what you wanna
T0nChz6ph0s,140239,142000,fight as you can probably imagine sex
T0nChz6ph0s,142000,144239,education talks about sexuality and how
T0nChz6ph0s,144239,146000,it affects people in certain communities
T0nChz6ph0s,146000,147920,in all of its different forms but that's
T0nChz6ph0s,147920,149440,only on the surface
T0nChz6ph0s,149440,151760,kind of let me explain at its core sex
T0nChz6ph0s,151760,153519,education is really a show about human
T0nChz6ph0s,153519,155200,connection and how it can completely
T0nChz6ph0s,155200,157120,redefine a person's existence there's a
T0nChz6ph0s,157120,158879,lot of beauty in this series and it's a
T0nChz6ph0s,158879,161280,story that is 100 percent driven by the
T0nChz6ph0s,161280,163120,characters and i'm dead serious here
T0nChz6ph0s,163120,165440,every single character in this show is
T0nChz6ph0s,165440,167280,amazing they're all graced with
T0nChz6ph0s,167280,168879,world-class writing and clever
T0nChz6ph0s,168879,171040,storylines that never feel overdone and
T0nChz6ph0s,171040,172959,the actors playing them are all insanely
T0nChz6ph0s,172959,174640,talented i feel the need to talk about
T0nChz6ph0s,174640,177040,sex education because i genuinely never
T0nChz6ph0s,177040,179200,expected to love this show so much i've
T0nChz6ph0s,179200,181280,seen it twice now and i actually think i
T0nChz6ph0s,181280,183120,liked it even more the second time but
T0nChz6ph0s,183120,184879,before we jump into it since i'm going
T0nChz6ph0s,184879,187280,to be talking about sex a lot this video
T0nChz6ph0s,187280,190640,is probably going to be demonetized so

T0nChz6ph0s,228319,230319,and let's get back to the show so sex
T0nChz6ph0s,230319,232799,education is the story of otis milburn a
T0nChz6ph0s,232799,233280,somewhat
T0nChz6ph0s,233280,235439,awkward 16 year old who knows a great
T0nChz6ph0s,235439,237439,deal about sex due to his mother being a
T0nChz6ph0s,237439,239519,sex therapist but who is also repressed
T0nChz6ph0s,239519,241680,when it comes to his own sexuality but
T0nChz6ph0s,241680,243280,we'll get back to that later otis and
T0nChz6ph0s,243280,244959,his best friend eric go about their
T0nChz6ph0s,244959,247040,lives largely unnoticed by their peers
T0nChz6ph0s,247040,247360,but
T0nChz6ph0s,247360,249519,one day a series of events unexpectedly
T0nChz6ph0s,249519,251360,leads otis to give sex advice to the
T0nChz6ph0s,251360,253040,school's resident bully and when his
T0nChz6ph0s,253040,254720,advice proves to actually work a
T0nChz6ph0s,254720,256959,rebellious emo girl named maeve sees an
T0nChz6ph0s,256959,258799,opportunity and decides to team up with
T0nChz6ph0s,258799,261040,otis to create a sex therapy business at
T0nChz6ph0s,261040,263280,school to make some quick money now on
T0nChz6ph0s,263280,265360,its own it's a pretty fun and quirky
T0nChz6ph0s,265360,267440,premise but it works exceptionally well
T0nChz6ph0s,267440,269280,because the writers know how to use the
T0nChz6ph0s,269280,271120,premise to elevate every single
T0nChz6ph0s,271120,272560,character in the show because my
T0nChz6ph0s,272560,274160,favorite thing about sex education is
T0nChz6ph0s,274160,275840,that it's a show that kind of serves as
T0nChz6ph0s,275840,277759,a giant middle finger to the entire
T0nChz6ph0s,277759,279840,tropes and cliches we've come to know in
T0nChz6ph0s,279840,281919,american television i often talk about
T0nChz6ph0s,281919,283280,how american tv
T0nChz6ph0s,283280,285280,especially when it comes to teen dramas
T0nChz6ph0s,285280,287280,are limited by stereotypical character
T0nChz6ph0s,287280,289520,traits that are repeated over and over
T0nChz6ph0s,289520,290479,and over again
T0nChz6ph0s,290479,292320,you know things like the bad boy with
T0nChz6ph0s,292320,294639,the heart of gold the underdeveloped gay
T0nChz6ph0s,294639,296000,best friend who's generally
T0nChz6ph0s,296000,297840,black and only serves as a sassy
T0nChz6ph0s,297840,299520,sidekick for the main character
T0nChz6ph0s,299520,301600,the one dimensional mean girl the
T0nChz6ph0s,301600,304160,outsider goth girl who's too emo to have
T0nChz6ph0s,304160,306320,friends the jock bully type dude who
T0nChz6ph0s,306320,308160,turns out to be gay you all know what
T0nChz6ph0s,308160,309600,types of characters i'm talking about
T0nChz6ph0s,309600,310560,we've all seen them
T0nChz6ph0s,310560,312720,done one way or another in some show or
T0nChz6ph0s,312720,314160,movie well the big strength of sex
T0nChz6ph0s,314160,316000,education as a show is that it kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,316000,318080,makes a point of deconstructing those
T0nChz6ph0s,318080,320080,cliches and it does it in a very clever
T0nChz6ph0s,320080,321840,way a lot of characters are presented as
T0nChz6ph0s,321840,324400,a very specific stereotype at first but
T0nChz6ph0s,324400,326080,then they kind of flip it on its head
T0nChz6ph0s,326080,327360,and they actually develop their
T0nChz6ph0s,327360,329280,personalities with insane amounts of
T0nChz6ph0s,329280,331039,layers and they all become their own
T0nChz6ph0s,331039,333360,characters with very unique traits like
T0nChz6ph0s,333360,334880,seriously i really appreciate that the
T0nChz6ph0s,334880,337440,show is not focused on crazy storylines
T0nChz6ph0s,337440,338000,and plot
T0nChz6ph0s,338000,340080,twists for shock value like it doesn't
T0nChz6ph0s,340080,342160,try to one-up itself by making things
T0nChz6ph0s,342160,344000,stupider and less sensical
T0nChz6ph0s,344000,346240,no the show is 100 focused on the
T0nChz6ph0s,346240,347919,characters and their motivations and
T0nChz6ph0s,347919,348800,aspirations
T0nChz6ph0s,348800,350240,it's also made better by the fact that
T0nChz6ph0s,350240,352240,these teenagers feel like they
T0nChz6ph0s,352240,354160,are teenagers a big criticism that i
T0nChz6ph0s,354160,355840,have of teen shows in america
T0nChz6ph0s,355840,357520,is that the characters don't feel like
T0nChz6ph0s,357520,359440,teenagers at all they don't act like
T0nChz6ph0s,359440,361440,teenagers they don't talk like teenagers
T0nChz6ph0s,361440,363360,and they definitely don't look like
T0nChz6ph0s,363360,365600,teenagers like the cw will try to make
T0nChz6ph0s,365600,366560,me believe that
T0nChz6ph0s,366560,369440,this guy is 15 years old and i just
T0nChz6ph0s,369440,370319,never will
T0nChz6ph0s,370319,373360,i'm sorry oh really jenna is 16 years
T0nChz6ph0s,373360,373759,old
T0nChz6ph0s,373759,375440,okay sure but anyways it's time to break
T0nChz6ph0s,375440,376960,down the show you know the drill so
T0nChz6ph0s,376960,378880,let's take a look at the main characters
T0nChz6ph0s,378880,382000,of netflix's sex education
T0nChz6ph0s,382000,384400,otis milburn so as i just said otis is
T0nChz6ph0s,384400,386080,the main protagonist of this show
T0nChz6ph0s,386080,387919,he's a great character but there isn't
T0nChz6ph0s,387919,389440,much to say about him
T0nChz6ph0s,389440,391120,and i think that's on purpose he's
T0nChz6ph0s,391120,393120,designed to be as simple as humanly
T0nChz6ph0s,393120,395120,possible and if you ask me it's done
T0nChz6ph0s,395120,396960,perfectly well oh this really feels like
T0nChz6ph0s,396960,398800,your average high school kid who's just
T0nChz6ph0s,398800,400800,trying to figure his [ __ ] out and so are
T0nChz6ph0s,400800,402400,most of the characters actually but it's
T0nChz6ph0s,402400,404240,crucial with him because you follow a
T0nChz6ph0s,404240,406160,big majority of the story through his
T0nChz6ph0s,406160,408400,eyes this show doesn't work if he
T0nChz6ph0s,408400,410000,doesn't feel like a real
T0nChz6ph0s,410000,412479,normal teenager and thankfully otis is
T0nChz6ph0s,412479,413759,played by none other than asa
T0nChz6ph0s,413759,415520,butterfield who in my opinion
T0nChz6ph0s,415520,417280,is one of the most underrated actors of
T0nChz6ph0s,417280,419120,the new generation otis is trying to
T0nChz6ph0s,419120,421039,figure out his own sexuality but
T0nChz6ph0s,421039,423199,something is kind of mentally blocking
T0nChz6ph0s,423199,424639,him when it comes to sex
T0nChz6ph0s,424639,426479,and he doesn't know why in a way you
T0nChz6ph0s,426479,428000,could say he has a sort of a
T0nChz6ph0s,428000,430479,sexual phobia and i mean that literally
T0nChz6ph0s,430479,431840,there's a scene where he tries to
T0nChz6ph0s,431840,433840,masturbate and it's such a challenge for
T0nChz6ph0s,433840,435680,him that he gets nauseous and he almost
T0nChz6ph0s,435680,437680,has a panic attack he knows a lot about
T0nChz6ph0s,437680,439360,sex because his mother is a sex
T0nChz6ph0s,439360,441280,therapist so he can help people who are
T0nChz6ph0s,441280,443199,sexually active which he does
T0nChz6ph0s,443199,444960,but when it comes to himself he's
T0nChz6ph0s,444960,446800,completely clueless he can't figure it
T0nChz6ph0s,446800,448560,out now otis as a person
T0nChz6ph0s,448560,450639,is pretty neutral he doesn't really have
T0nChz6ph0s,450639,452720,opinions about people or stuff like that
T0nChz6ph0s,452720,454720,he's the type of person that just blends
T0nChz6ph0s,454720,456880,in people don't really notice him he's a
T0nChz6ph0s,456880,458720,good guy he's nice agreeable
T0nChz6ph0s,458720,460319,and caring but he's also a really
T0nChz6ph0s,460319,462080,awkward dude he's not that good when it
T0nChz6ph0s,462080,464160,comes to human interaction he's a clever
T0nChz6ph0s,464160,466000,kid but whenever people he doesn't know
T0nChz6ph0s,466000,467919,too well try to interact with him he
T0nChz6ph0s,467919,468800,kind of loses
T0nChz6ph0s,468800,470879,all sense of coherence like he doesn't
T0nChz6ph0s,470879,472560,know what to do when he just
T0nChz6ph0s,472560,474800,panics something on your phone i don't
T0nChz6ph0s,474800,476080,have a phone what
T0nChz6ph0s,476080,479039,i do it's broken right reception i need
T0nChz6ph0s,479039,480160,to get it fixed at the car from
T0nChz6ph0s,480160,482800,warehouse thank goodness
T0nChz6ph0s,482800,485440,stop speaking but it's never overdone
T0nChz6ph0s,485440,486800,like to the point where he would just
T0nChz6ph0s,486800,488080,come across as stupid
T0nChz6ph0s,488080,489759,rather they use his awkwardness to
T0nChz6ph0s,489759,491280,create comedic moments that stay
T0nChz6ph0s,491280,492000,consistent with
T0nChz6ph0s,492000,493840,him and it works every time sometimes he
T0nChz6ph0s,493840,495440,gets himself in shitty situations
T0nChz6ph0s,495440,497440,because he's just very clumsy with his
T0nChz6ph0s,497440,499360,words and he will offend people because
T0nChz6ph0s,499360,501280,he can say things that will sound very
T0nChz6ph0s,501280,502080,insensitive
T0nChz6ph0s,502080,503520,even though that's not what he intends
T0nChz6ph0s,503520,505199,to do but despite being this
T0nChz6ph0s,505199,508000,nice neutral guy otis does have his
T0nChz6ph0s,508000,509840,flaws he thinks about himself a lot
T0nChz6ph0s,509840,511440,which some people can perceive as him
T0nChz6ph0s,511440,512880,being self-centered but
T0nChz6ph0s,512880,515360,it sort of makes sense because well he
T0nChz6ph0s,515360,516719,doesn't really have a lot of people
T0nChz6ph0s,516719,518159,around him when you meet him his
T0nChz6ph0s,518159,520479,personal circle boils down to his mom
T0nChz6ph0s,520479,522320,and his best friend he doesn't interact
T0nChz6ph0s,522320,523200,with other people
T0nChz6ph0s,523200,525120,aside from his dad here and there they
T0nChz6ph0s,525120,526880,skype sometimes but he can be a little
T0nChz6ph0s,526880,528720,bit of a dick sometimes he particularly
T0nChz6ph0s,528720,530880,has an episode where he willingly uses
T0nChz6ph0s,530880,532880,someone's trust of his expertise to
T0nChz6ph0s,532880,535440,sabotage them however when otis decides
T0nChz6ph0s,535440,537120,to do a dick move it often ends up
T0nChz6ph0s,537120,538800,blowing up in his face and he gets his
T0nChz6ph0s,538800,540320,comeuppance i think in short you can
T0nChz6ph0s,540320,542320,just say that otis is the perfect middle
T0nChz6ph0s,542320,544399,man he's switzerland he's meant to be an
T0nChz6ph0s,544399,546399,ordinary individual trying to navigate
T0nChz6ph0s,546399,548000,the weirdness of his surroundings
T0nChz6ph0s,548000,550000,and he does just that asa butterfield
T0nChz6ph0s,550000,552080,makes him super likable and honestly the
T0nChz6ph0s,552080,553920,show just doesn't work without him but
T0nChz6ph0s,553920,554640,now
T0nChz6ph0s,554640,557600,let's talk about his other half maeve
T0nChz6ph0s,557600,558320,wiley
T0nChz6ph0s,558320,561680,maeve is [ __ ] fantastic she honestly
T0nChz6ph0s,561680,563360,might be one of my favorite characters
T0nChz6ph0s,563360,564880,in any teen drama
T0nChz6ph0s,564880,566959,ever i literally don't have the words to
T0nChz6ph0s,566959,568880,express how much i appreciate this
T0nChz6ph0s,568880,570560,character she's truly amazing and
T0nChz6ph0s,570560,572320,there's a lot to say about her so strap
T0nChz6ph0s,572320,574000,in i'll start by saying that i really
T0nChz6ph0s,574000,575920,like how the writers flip the hollywood
T0nChz6ph0s,575920,577360,cliche of the strong
T0nChz6ph0s,577360,579760,female character with maeve not that she
T0nChz6ph0s,579760,581839,isn't a strong female character she is
T0nChz6ph0s,581839,583279,but the show has a very different
T0nChz6ph0s,583279,584880,approach when it comes to showing
T0nChz6ph0s,584880,586640,what makes her that hollywood has
T0nChz6ph0s,586640,588720,developed this weird stereotype of the
T0nChz6ph0s,588720,590399,strong female character in the past
T0nChz6ph0s,590399,592160,decade or so where their idea of
T0nChz6ph0s,592160,594240,portraying a confident woman on screen
T0nChz6ph0s,594240,596320,is just to make her really mean to
T0nChz6ph0s,596320,597200,everyone
T0nChz6ph0s,597200,599200,for no reason and that's the only
T0nChz6ph0s,599200,601279,personality trait they get to have
T0nChz6ph0s,601279,602800,and they try to sell that narrative that
T0nChz6ph0s,602800,604640,being rude and being confident
T0nChz6ph0s,604640,607839,are the same thing and that's stupid and
T0nChz6ph0s,607839,609279,through the character of maeve the show
T0nChz6ph0s,609279,610720,kinda makes fun of that troll by
T0nChz6ph0s,610720,612079,flipping it on its head and they
T0nChz6ph0s,612079,613760,actually use that to develop her
T0nChz6ph0s,613760,615760,character in a very intelligent way
T0nChz6ph0s,615760,618640,and by that i mean maeve is rude as [ __ ]
T0nChz6ph0s,618640,620640,and i mean it like this girl is just
T0nChz6ph0s,620640,621040,mean
T0nChz6ph0s,621040,623120,she hates everybody and everybody hates
T0nChz6ph0s,623120,624880,her and she's perfectly fine with that
T0nChz6ph0s,624880,626320,but the writers make a point of telling
T0nChz6ph0s,626320,627600,you that that's not what
T0nChz6ph0s,627600,630000,makes her a badass maeve is strong for a
T0nChz6ph0s,630000,631920,lot of reasons she's confident in a lot
T0nChz6ph0s,631920,633760,of ways but the show makes it very clear
T0nChz6ph0s,633760,634880,that she's also just an
T0nChz6ph0s,634880,636240,[ __ ] and it doesn't try to make
T0nChz6ph0s,636240,638000,excuses for her behavior you come to
T0nChz6ph0s,638000,638959,learn and understand
T0nChz6ph0s,638959,640800,why she is the way she is and you
T0nChz6ph0s,640800,642320,sympathize with her but it doesn't
T0nChz6ph0s,642320,643600,change the fact that she treats the
T0nChz6ph0s,643600,645440,people around her like garbage like she
T0nChz6ph0s,645440,647200,can't help it she doesn't even know why
T0nChz6ph0s,647200,648720,she does it but every time someone
T0nChz6ph0s,648720,650079,interacts with her she just
T0nChz6ph0s,650079,651600,has to be an [ __ ] and that's
T0nChz6ph0s,651600,653440,important because a lot of maeve's arc
T0nChz6ph0s,653440,655120,in the show is essentially just her
T0nChz6ph0s,655120,657200,working on herself and learning to stop
T0nChz6ph0s,657200,659200,seeing people as a mean to an end she's
T0nChz6ph0s,659200,660720,learning to let people in and that's
T0nChz6ph0s,660720,662480,where her relationship with otis comes
T0nChz6ph0s,662480,664399,into play see when you meet maeve she's
T0nChz6ph0s,664399,666399,as lonely as can be she doesn't have any
T0nChz6ph0s,666399,667680,friends or family
T0nChz6ph0s,667680,669519,she lives alone in a trailer and she's
T0nChz6ph0s,669519,671279,completely broke the biggest connection
T0nChz6ph0s,671279,673040,she has with another human being is the
T0nChz6ph0s,673040,674000,casual sex she's
T0nChz6ph0s,674000,676000,having with jackson but to her it's the
T0nChz6ph0s,676000,677360,only utility he has
T0nChz6ph0s,677360,679839,the second he tries to like be human
T0nChz6ph0s,679839,682160,with her and talk she kind of [ __ ] off
T0nChz6ph0s,682160,683200,she's not interested
T0nChz6ph0s,683200,684959,maeve has no interest in people if there
T0nChz6ph0s,684959,686720,isn't something she can directly
T0nChz6ph0s,686720,688320,get from them the second you're not
T0nChz6ph0s,688320,690480,useful to her you become a stranger she
T0nChz6ph0s,690480,692240,will ignore you and pretend you've never
T0nChz6ph0s,692240,694240,even met and when she meets otis that's
T0nChz6ph0s,694240,696000,exactly how it is the second she
T0nChz6ph0s,696000,698079,realizes she can use otis's knowledge of
T0nChz6ph0s,698079,700160,sex to make money she jumps on the
T0nChz6ph0s,700160,702240,occasion he's just a tool to her she has
T0nChz6ph0s,702240,703920,no problem manipulating him or
T0nChz6ph0s,703920,705760,gaslighting him to get him to do what
T0nChz6ph0s,705760,707680,she wants from him she kind of berates
T0nChz6ph0s,707680,708560,him actually
T0nChz6ph0s,708560,710560,she's always insulting him and mocking
T0nChz6ph0s,710560,712399,his appearance and awful [ __ ] like that
T0nChz6ph0s,712399,713600,and not in a friendly
T0nChz6ph0s,713600,715519,joking way no she's literally just
T0nChz6ph0s,715519,717760,bullying otis because she feels like it
T0nChz6ph0s,717760,719519,and since otis is kind of scared of her
T0nChz6ph0s,719519,721600,and shy he just kind of takes it because
T0nChz6ph0s,721600,722880,he doesn't really know how to stand up
T0nChz6ph0s,722880,723920,for himself
T0nChz6ph0s,723920,726320,[ __ ] off snowflake but after a while
T0nChz6ph0s,726320,728240,maeve kind of warms up to otis and
T0nChz6ph0s,728240,730160,through him she learns to open up again
T0nChz6ph0s,730160,731360,and let her guard down
T0nChz6ph0s,731360,733279,she even starts a real relationship with
T0nChz6ph0s,733279,734880,jackson thanks to him and that's when
T0nChz6ph0s,734880,736639,you get to know who the real maeve
T0nChz6ph0s,736639,738480,is so to speak we learned that maeve can
T0nChz6ph0s,738480,740480,actually be really kind and generous
T0nChz6ph0s,740480,742399,her mean persona while a true part of
T0nChz6ph0s,742399,744000,her personality is a defense
T0nChz6ph0s,744000,745760,mechanism that comes from her fear of
T0nChz6ph0s,745760,747920,being judged maeve is poor she doesn't
T0nChz6ph0s,747920,749600,have much and she's a few days away from
T0nChz6ph0s,749600,751600,being homeless and she's used to people
T0nChz6ph0s,751600,753360,judging her and looking at her a certain
T0nChz6ph0s,753360,755120,way and she doesn't like that that's why
T0nChz6ph0s,755120,756880,she keeps people away she had to be
T0nChz6ph0s,756880,758800,tough to survive and that's why she uses
T0nChz6ph0s,758800,760639,people as tools she's doing everything
T0nChz6ph0s,760639,762480,in her power to stay afloat and she
T0nChz6ph0s,762480,763519,barely gets by
T0nChz6ph0s,763519,765519,because she's a teenager there isn't
T0nChz6ph0s,765519,766800,much she can do
T0nChz6ph0s,766800,768240,it's established early on that she's
T0nChz6ph0s,768240,770079,actually very intelligent but she
T0nChz6ph0s,770079,772000,doesn't really put any effort in school
T0nChz6ph0s,772000,774000,because she can't really afford to think
T0nChz6ph0s,774000,776160,long term she's in a bad situation right
T0nChz6ph0s,776160,778240,now so she has to fix it right now and
T0nChz6ph0s,778240,780000,she doesn't trust people so from her
T0nChz6ph0s,780000,781360,point of view she doesn't have time to
T0nChz6ph0s,781360,783040,be nice and make friends she needs to
T0nChz6ph0s,783040,784560,find out what her next move is to
T0nChz6ph0s,784560,786160,survive the month but then maeve
T0nChz6ph0s,786160,787760,realizes that when it comes to how she
T0nChz6ph0s,787760,788639,sees the world
T0nChz6ph0s,788639,791120,otis and her are not that different and
T0nChz6ph0s,791120,792560,it's kind of the first time she doesn't
T0nChz6ph0s,792560,794079,feel alone and she's surprised to come
T0nChz6ph0s,794079,795920,to the realization that she actually
T0nChz6ph0s,795920,798160,likes otis see before she never really
T0nChz6ph0s,798160,800480,stopped to look at otis as a person
T0nChz6ph0s,800480,802240,again he was just a tool for her to get
T0nChz6ph0s,802240,804160,money quickly but then just for a quick
T0nChz6ph0s,804160,806480,second during one tiny conversation
T0nChz6ph0s,806480,808639,she lets her guard down and she actually
T0nChz6ph0s,808639,811040,realizes that she's enjoying his company
T0nChz6ph0s,811040,812720,it's a very small moment in the show but
T0nChz6ph0s,812720,814240,it does motivate a lot of her growth
T0nChz6ph0s,814240,816160,moving forward and then they bond even
T0nChz6ph0s,816160,818160,more when otis finds out she's pregnant
T0nChz6ph0s,818160,820079,and having an abortion and essentially
T0nChz6ph0s,820079,821519,him wanting to be there for her as she
T0nChz6ph0s,821519,823279,goes through this is a bit of a shock to
T0nChz6ph0s,823279,823600,her
T0nChz6ph0s,823600,825680,and it changes how she sees him not only
T0nChz6ph0s,825680,827440,because she contemplates the idea of
T0nChz6ph0s,827440,828000,having a
T0nChz6ph0s,828000,829920,friend but because she also realizes
T0nChz6ph0s,829920,831920,that otis doesn't look at her the same
T0nChz6ph0s,831920,833680,way everyone else does because otis
T0nChz6ph0s,833680,835120,doesn't really judge people
T0nChz6ph0s,835120,837120,he just kind of takes them as they are
T0nChz6ph0s,837120,838800,and it's very refreshing for maeve to
T0nChz6ph0s,838800,840480,spend time with someone who doesn't look
T0nChz6ph0s,840480,842240,down on her there are so many layers in
T0nChz6ph0s,842240,843680,their relationship it's honestly
T0nChz6ph0s,843680,845279,fascinating the progression of their
T0nChz6ph0s,845279,847279,bond over time feels very human
T0nChz6ph0s,847279,849120,and seeing these two grow to care very
T0nChz6ph0s,849120,850560,deeply for each other is kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,850560,851199,beautiful
T0nChz6ph0s,851199,852880,maeve's growth as a character is just
T0nChz6ph0s,852880,854320,insanely well done
T0nChz6ph0s,854320,856399,i really struggle to find any flaws with
T0nChz6ph0s,856399,858480,this character she's truly amazing and
T0nChz6ph0s,858480,859920,it's only made better by the fact that
T0nChz6ph0s,859920,861519,emma mackie is just
T0nChz6ph0s,861519,863680,perfect in this role her performance is
T0nChz6ph0s,863680,864800,just next level
T0nChz6ph0s,864800,866480,and there isn't a single moment where
T0nChz6ph0s,866480,868240,she's not giving it her all and she's
T0nChz6ph0s,868240,869920,french so i gotta appreciate the talent
T0nChz6ph0s,869920,873440,of this caliber representing us
T0nChz6ph0s,878240,880560,okay i'm pushing it eric effiong so
T0nChz6ph0s,880560,882000,here's the thing eric is the best
T0nChz6ph0s,882000,883680,character in this entire show and he's
T0nChz6ph0s,883680,884639,my best friend
T0nChz6ph0s,884639,886560,i mean he doesn't really know that we're
T0nChz6ph0s,886560,887839,best friends yet but
T0nChz6ph0s,887839,890240,it should be any minute now eric is otis
T0nChz6ph0s,890240,892720,sassy black gay best friend which is one
T0nChz6ph0s,892720,894399,of the biggest cliches in these types of
T0nChz6ph0s,894399,896079,shows but he's very intentionally
T0nChz6ph0s,896079,897199,presented as such
T0nChz6ph0s,897199,898880,you quickly realize that there is way
T0nChz6ph0s,898880,900959,more to him that meets the eye and in my
T0nChz6ph0s,900959,901519,opinion
T0nChz6ph0s,901519,903360,eric has the best storyline in the
T0nChz6ph0s,903360,905600,entire show during season 1. so eric has
T0nChz6ph0s,905600,907120,been best friends with otis since they
T0nChz6ph0s,907120,908880,were like 9 years old i think and they
T0nChz6ph0s,908880,910639,have a lot in common like i said earlier
T0nChz6ph0s,910639,912240,they largely live their lives like
T0nChz6ph0s,912240,914079,ghosts they're your typical high school
T0nChz6ph0s,914079,916160,losers that no one really notices and
T0nChz6ph0s,916160,917760,they're kind of like brothers they go
T0nChz6ph0s,917760,919279,through life together hand in hand
T0nChz6ph0s,919279,920720,and that's one of the most heartwarming
T0nChz6ph0s,920720,922560,aspects of the show the writers kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,922560,924320,treat eric and otis like their soul
T0nChz6ph0s,924320,926000,mates and i really like that idea
T0nChz6ph0s,926000,927920,however there is one very specific
T0nChz6ph0s,927920,930000,difference between eric and otis you see
T0nChz6ph0s,930000,930639,otis
T0nChz6ph0s,930639,932800,likes being a ghost he actually enjoys
T0nChz6ph0s,932800,934399,the fact that no one really notices him
T0nChz6ph0s,934399,935920,he doesn't want attention at all
T0nChz6ph0s,935920,937600,he'd rather just be in the background
T0nChz6ph0s,937600,939920,but eric is the opposite of that being
T0nChz6ph0s,939920,941199,gay he has had to repress
T0nChz6ph0s,941199,943279,himself or parts of himself most of his
T0nChz6ph0s,943279,945279,life and as a result he kind of craves
T0nChz6ph0s,945279,946880,attention but not necessarily in a
T0nChz6ph0s,946880,949040,narcissistic way at his core eric just
T0nChz6ph0s,949040,951519,wants to be himself he wants to be loud
T0nChz6ph0s,951519,953839,and flashy and extra he wants to be able
T0nChz6ph0s,953839,956160,to make people see him for who he really
T0nChz6ph0s,956160,958000,is that's why he wants to be a popular
T0nChz6ph0s,958000,959680,kid at school he knows he's kind of a
T0nChz6ph0s,959680,961600,weirdo but he likes that about himself
T0nChz6ph0s,961600,963519,he doesn't mind he just wants to be seen
T0nChz6ph0s,963519,965519,he wants to feel validated for being
T0nChz6ph0s,965519,967279,himself and the show carries that theme
T0nChz6ph0s,967279,970240,perfectly with him
T0nChz6ph0s,974970,977920,[Applause]
T0nChz6ph0s,977920,980079,i'm sorry his character arc in the show
T0nChz6ph0s,980079,982959,is insanely good and yes again the sassy
T0nChz6ph0s,982959,985040,black gay best friend is a cliche but it
T0nChz6ph0s,985040,987120,works with eric because being sassy is
T0nChz6ph0s,987120,988959,not his only personality trait the
T0nChz6ph0s,988959,990959,writers completely broke the stereotype
T0nChz6ph0s,990959,993519,here eric is not just otis sidekick he
T0nChz6ph0s,993519,995519,definitely is a main character in his
T0nChz6ph0s,995519,996079,own right
T0nChz6ph0s,996079,998160,which i love usually the gay best friend
T0nChz6ph0s,998160,999360,is only ever tied to the main
T0nChz6ph0s,999360,1001360,protagonist but eric actually kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,1001360,1003040,spends a lot of time doing his own thing
T0nChz6ph0s,1003040,1004639,in this show specifically a lot of his
T0nChz6ph0s,1004639,1006720,story in season 1 is directly tied to
T0nChz6ph0s,1006720,1008639,his father and their relationship is
T0nChz6ph0s,1008639,1011040,very well written his dad who has a very
T0nChz6ph0s,1011040,1012079,different culture
T0nChz6ph0s,1012079,1014240,is accepting of the fact that eric is
T0nChz6ph0s,1014240,1015120,gay like he's
T0nChz6ph0s,1015120,1017199,cool with it but he's not okay with eric
T0nChz6ph0s,1017199,1019120,displaying it to everyone because he's
T0nChz6ph0s,1019120,1021199,afraid of how people will treat him like
T0nChz6ph0s,1021199,1022800,he doesn't want him to get hurt and the
T0nChz6ph0s,1022800,1024480,show doesn't try to villainize him for
T0nChz6ph0s,1024480,1025678,that especially because
T0nChz6ph0s,1025678,1027520,without getting too much into it there
T0nChz6ph0s,1027520,1029520,is an episode where his father's fears
T0nChz6ph0s,1029520,1030959,come true and it has massive
T0nChz6ph0s,1030959,1032720,repercussions on the character of eric
T0nChz6ph0s,1032720,1034480,and don't get me wrong eric disagrees
T0nChz6ph0s,1034480,1036240,with his father's opinion when it comes
T0nChz6ph0s,1036240,1037918,to how he should appear to the outside
T0nChz6ph0s,1037918,1039760,world but he understands his point of
T0nChz6ph0s,1039760,1041600,view he's very aware that his father is
T0nChz6ph0s,1041600,1043600,just being protective because he cares
T0nChz6ph0s,1043600,1045360,and he's worried and as things unfold
T0nChz6ph0s,1045360,1046959,they both learn a great deal from one
T0nChz6ph0s,1046959,1048558,another and they come to understand each
T0nChz6ph0s,1048558,1050160,other in a way that makes them closer
T0nChz6ph0s,1050160,1050480,than
T0nChz6ph0s,1050480,1052400,ever coming with eric also learning to
T0nChz6ph0s,1052400,1054480,reconcile his sexual identity with his
T0nChz6ph0s,1054480,1055120,religion
T0nChz6ph0s,1055120,1056880,it's a beautiful relationship and it
T0nChz6ph0s,1056880,1059120,also offers a perfect contrast to eric's
T0nChz6ph0s,1059120,1061360,chaotic romance storylines i will also
T0nChz6ph0s,1061360,1062720,say that i really appreciate the
T0nChz6ph0s,1062720,1064480,friendship between eric and otis these
T0nChz6ph0s,1064480,1065360,two just work
T0nChz6ph0s,1065360,1067760,so well together and their bone feels so
T0nChz6ph0s,1067760,1069520,[ __ ] real the writers make sure that
T0nChz6ph0s,1069520,1071120,you really care about their friendship
T0nChz6ph0s,1071120,1072480,and they're really good at it because
T0nChz6ph0s,1072480,1074240,every time these two are having a fight
T0nChz6ph0s,1074240,1074799,it has
T0nChz6ph0s,1074799,1076960,weight it has meaning and you're on edge
T0nChz6ph0s,1076960,1078960,because you don't want them to fight you
T0nChz6ph0s,1078960,1080640,want them to be best friends
T0nChz6ph0s,1080640,1082880,just [ __ ] give him a hug man the show
T0nChz6ph0s,1082880,1084320,does such a great job at showing you
T0nChz6ph0s,1084320,1086240,their friendship is extremely important
T0nChz6ph0s,1086240,1088160,to their individual well-being like it's
T0nChz6ph0s,1088160,1090000,really a part of their characters eric
T0nChz6ph0s,1090000,1092320,and otis are absolutely amazing they
T0nChz6ph0s,1092320,1093760,have one of the best written friendships
T0nChz6ph0s,1093760,1095600,i have seen in a really long time and i
T0nChz6ph0s,1095600,1096240,enjoy
T0nChz6ph0s,1096240,1098320,every minute of it but overall eric is
T0nChz6ph0s,1098320,1100160,just so [ __ ] good as a character
T0nChz6ph0s,1100160,1102160,there isn't a single moment where this
T0nChz6ph0s,1102160,1104000,guy is on screen and i'm not eating it
T0nChz6ph0s,1104000,1104960,up he steals
T0nChz6ph0s,1104960,1107120,every scene he's in also all of the
T0nChz6ph0s,1107120,1108559,funniest moments in this show are
T0nChz6ph0s,1108559,1110240,directly linked to him he's one of the
T0nChz6ph0s,1110240,1112400,funniest tv characters in recent memory
T0nChz6ph0s,1112400,1114240,he's [ __ ] legendary and he's
T0nChz6ph0s,1114240,1115919,my best friend there are other
T0nChz6ph0s,1115919,1117600,characters that are all absolutely
T0nChz6ph0s,1117600,1119200,marvelous in this show like i said
T0nChz6ph0s,1119200,1121039,everyone feels like a very distinct
T0nChz6ph0s,1121039,1123039,person with complex character traits and
T0nChz6ph0s,1123039,1125039,they really feel like a community of
T0nChz6ph0s,1125039,1126720,people more so than a roaster of
T0nChz6ph0s,1126720,1128480,fictional characters the show really
T0nChz6ph0s,1128480,1130240,gets you to care about everybody for
T0nChz6ph0s,1130240,1132160,different reasons even minor characters
T0nChz6ph0s,1132160,1133840,that appear in like one episode
T0nChz6ph0s,1133840,1135520,are really fleshed out and full of
T0nChz6ph0s,1135520,1137360,layers i'm especially thinking about one
T0nChz6ph0s,1137360,1139200,character in episode 3 that deals with a
T0nChz6ph0s,1139200,1141120,very difficult subject matter but her
T0nChz6ph0s,1141120,1143360,characterization is so incredible that i
T0nChz6ph0s,1143360,1145200,still remember her as a top character on
T0nChz6ph0s,1145200,1145679,the show
T0nChz6ph0s,1145679,1147440,even though she was only in like half of
T0nChz6ph0s,1147440,1149280,an episode but yeah the rest of the main
T0nChz6ph0s,1149280,1151039,cast is just as memorable as the main
T0nChz6ph0s,1151039,1152160,three you got jackson
T0nChz6ph0s,1152160,1153919,he's the star athlete of the school he's
T0nChz6ph0s,1153919,1155440,a swimmer he's a really good guy who
T0nChz6ph0s,1155440,1156160,means well
T0nChz6ph0s,1156160,1158000,he wants to do things right but he also
T0nChz6ph0s,1158000,1159600,struggles to handle the pressure that's
T0nChz6ph0s,1159600,1161280,constantly being put on him he feels the
T0nChz6ph0s,1161280,1163039,need to excel at everything because
T0nChz6ph0s,1163039,1164640,it's the only way he gets the approval
T0nChz6ph0s,1164640,1166160,of his parents or at least that's what
T0nChz6ph0s,1166160,1166720,he thinks
T0nChz6ph0s,1166720,1168160,but the thing is he comes to realize
T0nChz6ph0s,1168160,1170080,that he doesn't really enjoy
T0nChz6ph0s,1170080,1172160,swimming anymore at first he thinks he
T0nChz6ph0s,1172160,1173919,does because he's good at it but
T0nChz6ph0s,1173919,1175679,eventually he comes to the realization
T0nChz6ph0s,1175679,1176000,that
T0nChz6ph0s,1176000,1178000,he's not really doing it for himself
T0nChz6ph0s,1178000,1180080,he's doing it because his mother wants
T0nChz6ph0s,1180080,1181600,him to it's kind of just like my mom
T0nChz6ph0s,1181600,1184240,wanted me to be a lawyer
T0nChz6ph0s,1184240,1185840,sorry mom god that would have been a
T0nChz6ph0s,1185840,1187600,disaster like jackson is a character
T0nChz6ph0s,1187600,1189440,that is trapped in the high expectations
T0nChz6ph0s,1189440,1191360,people have for him he's leaving his
T0nChz6ph0s,1191360,1193039,mother's dreams and she's so
T0nChz6ph0s,1193039,1195039,into it and she's so severe with him
T0nChz6ph0s,1195039,1196640,that she doesn't seem to understand that
T0nChz6ph0s,1196640,1198480,she's pushing him way too hard he wants
T0nChz6ph0s,1198480,1200080,to stop swimming but he doesn't really
T0nChz6ph0s,1200080,1201200,know how to tell her
T0nChz6ph0s,1201200,1202960,and it becomes such a source of anxiety
T0nChz6ph0s,1202960,1204880,for him that he ends up hurting himself
T0nChz6ph0s,1204880,1206080,on purpose to escape
T0nChz6ph0s,1206080,1208240,it literally he [ __ ] up his own hand so
T0nChz6ph0s,1208240,1209919,he can stop swimming without having to
T0nChz6ph0s,1209919,1211600,tell his mom that he doesn't want to do
T0nChz6ph0s,1211600,1213440,it anymore he's a great character with a
T0nChz6ph0s,1213440,1215679,lot of natural charisma and season 2 in
T0nChz6ph0s,1215679,1217520,particular is where he gets to shun in
T0nChz6ph0s,1217520,1218240,my opinion
T0nChz6ph0s,1218240,1220000,adam is also very interesting as a
T0nChz6ph0s,1220000,1221520,character he's the school's resident
T0nChz6ph0s,1221520,1223360,bully i mentioned earlier and just like
T0nChz6ph0s,1223360,1224960,other characters he's presented as a
T0nChz6ph0s,1224960,1227440,total cliche at first adam is a guy that
T0nChz6ph0s,1227440,1228000,is just
T0nChz6ph0s,1228000,1230320,completely lost he's not very bright
T0nChz6ph0s,1230320,1231600,like he's pretty dumb
T0nChz6ph0s,1231600,1233760,and he has absolutely no idea what he's
T0nChz6ph0s,1233760,1235440,doing he's also the son of the principal
T0nChz6ph0s,1235440,1237200,who's an excessively strict [ __ ]
T0nChz6ph0s,1237200,1238960,who's always embarrassed of his own son
T0nChz6ph0s,1238960,1240480,and you kind of get the sense that adam
T0nChz6ph0s,1240480,1242559,turned into this volatile bully because
T0nChz6ph0s,1242559,1244400,that's the only sense of control he
T0nChz6ph0s,1244400,1246240,feels in his life literally the second
T0nChz6ph0s,1246240,1248080,his dad doesn't have eyes on him he does
T0nChz6ph0s,1248080,1250080,a lot of dumb [ __ ] and i'm ready to bet
T0nChz6ph0s,1250080,1252320,that most of the time he has no idea why
T0nChz6ph0s,1252320,1253919,he's doing these things and out of all
T0nChz6ph0s,1253919,1255840,the characters in the show i think adam
T0nChz6ph0s,1255840,1257440,is probably the one that surprised me
T0nChz6ph0s,1257440,1258000,the most
T0nChz6ph0s,1258000,1259919,simply because i didn't think for a
T0nChz6ph0s,1259919,1261919,second that i would ever end up liking
T0nChz6ph0s,1261919,1262640,him
T0nChz6ph0s,1262640,1264720,but i did and it just goes to show how
T0nChz6ph0s,1264720,1266720,effective the writers are his character
T0nChz6ph0s,1266720,1268400,or more specifically the archetype he
T0nChz6ph0s,1268400,1270400,represents is deconstructed in such an
T0nChz6ph0s,1270400,1272400,intelligent way that he ends up being
T0nChz6ph0s,1272400,1273919,developed in a manner that makes it
T0nChz6ph0s,1273919,1275840,impossible for you not to sympathize
T0nChz6ph0s,1275840,1277679,with him at the very least and just like
T0nChz6ph0s,1277679,1278320,jackson
T0nChz6ph0s,1278320,1280080,season 2 is where you really get to see
T0nChz6ph0s,1280080,1282080,his art come to fruition and yeah
T0nChz6ph0s,1282080,1284240,adam is a really good character the most
T0nChz6ph0s,1284240,1286880,lovable dumbass in the uk
T0nChz6ph0s,1286880,1290559,you're so wise
T0nChz6ph0s,1290559,1294640,like an old owl amy is another character
T0nChz6ph0s,1294640,1295840,that i like quite a bit
T0nChz6ph0s,1295840,1298080,just like adam she's not all that bright
T0nChz6ph0s,1298080,1300000,like she's kind of an airhead but she's
T0nChz6ph0s,1300000,1301360,sweet and she means well
T0nChz6ph0s,1301360,1303039,her big problem though is that she's a
T0nChz6ph0s,1303039,1304720,people pleaser and because her peers
T0nChz6ph0s,1304720,1306480,don't give her any value she kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,1306480,1308240,lets herself be bossed around by her
T0nChz6ph0s,1308240,1310240,popular friends and you feel really bad
T0nChz6ph0s,1310240,1312000,for her because people just treat her
T0nChz6ph0s,1312000,1313120,like [ __ ] she has
T0nChz6ph0s,1313120,1315120,zero self-esteem and it gets so bad that
T0nChz6ph0s,1315120,1316880,when a guy asks her what she wants
T0nChz6ph0s,1316880,1319280,during sex she freezes and seeks help
T0nChz6ph0s,1319280,1319760,because
T0nChz6ph0s,1319760,1321840,no one has ever asked her that before
T0nChz6ph0s,1321840,1323200,and not even just when it comes to her
T0nChz6ph0s,1323200,1324799,sex life but in general
T0nChz6ph0s,1324799,1326480,nobody gives enough of a [ __ ] about her
T0nChz6ph0s,1326480,1328799,to ask her how she is or what she wants
T0nChz6ph0s,1328799,1330400,so she just goes through life with a big
T0nChz6ph0s,1330400,1331600,smile on her face and pretends
T0nChz6ph0s,1331600,1332000,everything
T0nChz6ph0s,1332000,1334080,is good but nothing is happening up
T0nChz6ph0s,1334080,1336320,there she's on total autopilot mode amy
T0nChz6ph0s,1336320,1338720,has a minor relevancy in season 1 but in
T0nChz6ph0s,1338720,1340240,season 2 she has one of the most
T0nChz6ph0s,1340240,1342159,powerful storylines in the entire show
T0nChz6ph0s,1342159,1343520,that deals with the fallout of her
T0nChz6ph0s,1343520,1345280,mental health after having been sexually
T0nChz6ph0s,1345280,1347200,assaulted in a bust the show addresses
T0nChz6ph0s,1347200,1348640,the subject in a way that is so
T0nChz6ph0s,1348640,1350799,compelling and strong all while staying
T0nChz6ph0s,1350799,1352320,perfectly consistent with who the
T0nChz6ph0s,1352320,1354159,character is and it seriously deserves
T0nChz6ph0s,1354159,1355760,all the credit in the world through amy
T0nChz6ph0s,1355760,1358000,alone sex education completely outdid
T0nChz6ph0s,1358000,1360080,everything 13 reasons why i miserably
T0nChz6ph0s,1360080,1362000,failed to do for four seasons are you
T0nChz6ph0s,1362000,1363039,proud of yourself
T0nChz6ph0s,1363039,1365200,you're useless and then we have gene
T0nChz6ph0s,1365200,1366240,otis's mom
T0nChz6ph0s,1366240,1368159,who as i mentioned earlier is a sex
T0nChz6ph0s,1368159,1370080,therapist she's very open and well
T0nChz6ph0s,1370080,1371840,spoken with everything that is sex
T0nChz6ph0s,1371840,1374000,related but sometimes she just kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,1374000,1376080,doesn't understand that not everybody is
T0nChz6ph0s,1376080,1378159,as comfortable as she is to talk about
T0nChz6ph0s,1378159,1379600,sex in explicit ways
T0nChz6ph0s,1379600,1381280,and because of that she can come across
T0nChz6ph0s,1381280,1382640,as a little intrusive
T0nChz6ph0s,1382640,1384159,also she thinks she's a little too
T0nChz6ph0s,1384159,1386159,clever for her own good sometimes which
T0nChz6ph0s,1386159,1387840,is a trait she shares with otis there's
T0nChz6ph0s,1387840,1389520,a scene in particular where she tells a
T0nChz6ph0s,1389520,1391600,man she just slept with what she thinks
T0nChz6ph0s,1391600,1393080,he's like based on her
T0nChz6ph0s,1393080,1395039,observations she gives him this whole
T0nChz6ph0s,1395039,1396559,speech about how she thinks he's a
T0nChz6ph0s,1396559,1398880,reckless player who sleeps with all of
T0nChz6ph0s,1398880,1400720,his clients and all that stuff but then
T0nChz6ph0s,1400720,1402799,he just tells her that his wife died and
T0nChz6ph0s,1402799,1404559,he became an alcoholic and she's
T0nChz6ph0s,1404559,1406320,actually the first person he has slept
T0nChz6ph0s,1406320,1408400,with since his wife passed and jean
T0nChz6ph0s,1408400,1410159,feels really guilty because she just
T0nChz6ph0s,1410159,1411520,insulted him to his
T0nChz6ph0s,1411520,1413360,face the show just has a way of bringing
T0nChz6ph0s,1413360,1415039,characters back down to earth when they
T0nChz6ph0s,1415039,1415360,seem
T0nChz6ph0s,1415360,1417440,too perfect and due to her personality
T0nChz6ph0s,1417440,1419360,jean does not often allow herself to be
T0nChz6ph0s,1419360,1421360,vulnerable so those moments do a lot for
T0nChz6ph0s,1421360,1422400,her character but
T0nChz6ph0s,1422400,1424559,gina is also a little bit of a weirdo
T0nChz6ph0s,1424559,1426080,she does things that can be kind of
T0nChz6ph0s,1426080,1427840,questionable at times like she decides
T0nChz6ph0s,1427840,1429760,to write a book about her own sexually
T0nChz6ph0s,1429760,1430720,repressed son
T0nChz6ph0s,1430720,1432720,without telling him about it in the
T0nChz6ph0s,1432720,1434559,first episode she also smokes weed with
T0nChz6ph0s,1434559,1437039,one of otis's classmates who's 16
T0nChz6ph0s,1437039,1438960,like she's eccentric in a lot of ways
T0nChz6ph0s,1438960,1440720,but she really owns it because despite
T0nChz6ph0s,1440720,1442159,all of her weird shenanigans
T0nChz6ph0s,1442159,1444400,jean is also a really good mother she
T0nChz6ph0s,1444400,1446559,cares very deeply about otis and you can
T0nChz6ph0s,1446559,1448400,see that losing her connection with him
T0nChz6ph0s,1448400,1450320,is actually very difficult for her she's
T0nChz6ph0s,1450320,1452080,struggling with the idea of her son
T0nChz6ph0s,1452080,1453919,not needing her anymore and the show
T0nChz6ph0s,1453919,1455760,does a fantastic job at handling this
T0nChz6ph0s,1455760,1457600,theme in a unique way that stays true to
T0nChz6ph0s,1457600,1459440,her character honestly i could go all
T0nChz6ph0s,1459440,1460880,day about the characters in this show
T0nChz6ph0s,1460880,1462320,i'm not kidding even the characters that
T0nChz6ph0s,1462320,1464080,don't stand out as much are still
T0nChz6ph0s,1464080,1467039,[ __ ] awesome like ola is dope viv has
T0nChz6ph0s,1467039,1468400,a very interesting art
T0nChz6ph0s,1468400,1470720,raheem is cool oh and there's lily this
T0nChz6ph0s,1470720,1472000,strange girl who just wants
T0nChz6ph0s,1472000,1473840,to have sex for the first time she
T0nChz6ph0s,1473840,1475120,doesn't even know why
T0nChz6ph0s,1475120,1476880,she just wants to it's a pretty funny
T0nChz6ph0s,1476880,1478559,storyline with subtle messages and then
T0nChz6ph0s,1478559,1480159,in season two it transforms into
T0nChz6ph0s,1480159,1481760,something else entirely but i won't
T0nChz6ph0s,1481760,1483520,spoil it all of the characters in this
T0nChz6ph0s,1483520,1484159,show feel
T0nChz6ph0s,1484159,1486720,very human and grounded and is insanely
T0nChz6ph0s,1486720,1488720,refreshing for a teen show the writers
T0nChz6ph0s,1488720,1490240,have a real talent when it comes to
T0nChz6ph0s,1490240,1492559,balancing humor and drama in a scene
T0nChz6ph0s,1492559,1494159,they manage to jump between the two
T0nChz6ph0s,1494159,1495840,seamlessly and it never feels like the
T0nChz6ph0s,1495840,1497679,tone of the show is affected and it's
T0nChz6ph0s,1497679,1498240,pretty neat
T0nChz6ph0s,1498240,1499760,also i need to point out that the
T0nChz6ph0s,1499760,1501679,dialogue is just really good in this
T0nChz6ph0s,1501679,1503120,show there are entire scenes where
T0nChz6ph0s,1503120,1504720,characters are just sitting around
T0nChz6ph0s,1504720,1506480,bantering and it's incredibly
T0nChz6ph0s,1506480,1508400,entertaining sex education has a sense
T0nChz6ph0s,1508400,1509760,of charisma that makes shows like
T0nChz6ph0s,1509760,1511760,riverdale look completely pathetic and
T0nChz6ph0s,1511760,1513440,it's mostly thanks to the dialogue and
T0nChz6ph0s,1513440,1515279,it all just feels very natural
T0nChz6ph0s,1515279,1516720,and i think it makes you get attached to
T0nChz6ph0s,1516720,1518480,the characters even more now usually
T0nChz6ph0s,1518480,1520000,after breaking down the characters i
T0nChz6ph0s,1520000,1521840,dive into the story a little more
T0nChz6ph0s,1521840,1523600,but i don't think i need to do that with
T0nChz6ph0s,1523600,1525279,sex education honestly if you haven't
T0nChz6ph0s,1525279,1527039,watched this show i highly recommend you
T0nChz6ph0s,1527039,1528640,check it out i purposefully left a lot
T0nChz6ph0s,1528640,1530559,of plot points out of this video because
T0nChz6ph0s,1530559,1532080,i think you should experience them on
T0nChz6ph0s,1532080,1533360,your own but trust me
T0nChz6ph0s,1533360,1535200,you're going to love it i genuinely
T0nChz6ph0s,1535200,1536880,think it's impossible to watch this show
T0nChz6ph0s,1536880,1539279,and flat out hate it it's just a blast
T0nChz6ph0s,1539279,1541840,points we call clients numerous students
T0nChz6ph0s,1541840,1543039,have approached me today hoping to
T0nChz6ph0s,1543039,1544080,secure our services
T0nChz6ph0s,1544080,1547279,no willing to pay keep talking actually
T0nChz6ph0s,1547279,1549360,that's it that's it now yes being honest
T0nChz6ph0s,1549360,1551200,and trying to be as balanced as i can be
T0nChz6ph0s,1551200,1553279,the show has some downsides there are
T0nChz6ph0s,1553279,1555039,one of two characters that i don't like
T0nChz6ph0s,1555039,1555760,this much
T0nChz6ph0s,1555760,1557760,maeve's brother is one of them he shows
T0nChz6ph0s,1557760,1558960,up in season one
T0nChz6ph0s,1558960,1560480,and i don't know i just felt like he was
T0nChz6ph0s,1560480,1561919,kind of [ __ ] with the pacing of the
T0nChz6ph0s,1561919,1563279,show and there's also the school's
T0nChz6ph0s,1563279,1565440,principal who is great in season one but
T0nChz6ph0s,1565440,1567039,in season two they do things with a
T0nChz6ph0s,1567039,1568720,character that make him a little too
T0nChz6ph0s,1568720,1570960,much of a cartoon villain if i can say
T0nChz6ph0s,1570960,1572400,that there are a few things here and
T0nChz6ph0s,1572400,1573760,there that are kind of off about the
T0nChz6ph0s,1573760,1575600,show but honestly there's so much
T0nChz6ph0s,1575600,1577919,good in it that the few flaws it has are
T0nChz6ph0s,1577919,1579919,easily forgettable i swear most of you
T0nChz6ph0s,1579919,1581520,probably won't even notice them there
T0nChz6ph0s,1581520,1583200,are two seasons out right now season 3
T0nChz6ph0s,1583200,1584000,was already confirmed
T0nChz6ph0s,1584000,1585679,by netflix i think it was supposed to
T0nChz6ph0s,1585679,1587360,come out last year but it was delayed
T0nChz6ph0s,1587360,1589120,because of covet but i hope it comes out
T0nChz6ph0s,1589120,1590720,soon because i cannot
T0nChz6ph0s,1590720,1592799,wait to get more of this show the comedy
T0nChz6ph0s,1592799,1594720,works the drama works the writing is
T0nChz6ph0s,1594720,1596159,just [ __ ] spectacular the
T0nChz6ph0s,1596159,1598000,performances are [ __ ] spectacular
T0nChz6ph0s,1598000,1600960,and overall like i said sex education is
T0nChz6ph0s,1600960,1603279,pretty close to perfect
T0nChz6ph0s,1603279,1604960,now leave me alone i gotta go tell eric
T0nChz6ph0s,1604960,1613840,he's my best friend
