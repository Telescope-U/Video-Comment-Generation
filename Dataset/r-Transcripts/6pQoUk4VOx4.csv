6pQoUk4VOx4,0,1439,let's say you've got loads of money and
6pQoUk4VOx4,1439,4560,you want a posh luxury suv with a sporty
6pQoUk4VOx4,4560,6000,edge to it but you don't want to give
6pQoUk4VOx4,6000,7839,the tax man loads of cash
6pQoUk4VOx4,7839,9200,you're gonna need the plug-in hybrid and
6pQoUk4VOx4,9200,10960,the bentley bentayga hybrid is a good
6pQoUk4VOx4,10960,12320,choice but
6pQoUk4VOx4,12320,14559,if you're cash savvy even though you're
6pQoUk4VOx4,14559,15599,rich
6pQoUk4VOx4,15599,16800,should you really be spending all that
6pQoUk4VOx4,16800,18880,extra on the bentley bentayga plug-in
6pQoUk4VOx4,18880,20960,hybrid when you could have a range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,20960,23680,sport plug-in hybrid is this really
6pQoUk4VOx4,23680,25760,twice as good as this car because it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,25760,27760,pretty much twice the money well in this
6pQoUk4VOx4,27760,28640,video
6pQoUk4VOx4,28640,30480,we're gonna find out we're going to do
6pQoUk4VOx4,30480,32719,that by comparing their exteriors their
6pQoUk4VOx4,32719,34559,interiors just how luxurious they are
6pQoUk4VOx4,34559,36239,their technology i'm going to launch
6pQoUk4VOx4,36239,37360,them to see how quick they are from
6pQoUk4VOx4,37360,38640,north to 60 miles an hour because that
6pQoUk4VOx4,38640,40079,matters also we're going to compare
6pQoUk4VOx4,40079,41920,their efficiency and how much they will
6pQoUk4VOx4,41920,43600,cost you per month anyway i'm matt
6pQoUk4VOx4,43600,45920,watson and you're watching car wow yes
6pQoUk4VOx4,45920,47120,you are
6pQoUk4VOx4,47120,49200,buying a new car then head to car wow
6pQoUk4VOx4,49200,50719,and my team will help you find your next
6pQoUk4VOx4,50719,53120,car at a fair price car wow your
6pQoUk4VOx4,53120,55520,one-stop car buying comparison site
6pQoUk4VOx4,55520,56960,let's start this video by comparing
6pQoUk4VOx4,56960,58879,these cars hybrid systems so this
6pQoUk4VOx4,58879,60800,bentley has a three liter turbocharged
6pQoUk4VOx4,60800,62800,v6 mated to an electric motor and it
6pQoUk4VOx4,62800,65920,puts out 449 horsepower and 700 newton
6pQoUk4VOx4,65920,67439,meters of torque it drives all four
6pQoUk4VOx4,67439,69119,wheels fine eight speed automatic
6pQoUk4VOx4,69119,70799,gearbox this land rover also has
6pQoUk4VOx4,70799,72640,all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic
6pQoUk4VOx4,72640,75040,gearbox however its engine has two less
6pQoUk4VOx4,75040,76799,cylinders than the bentleys it's just a
6pQoUk4VOx4,76799,79600,two-liter four-cylinder combined with an
6pQoUk4VOx4,79600,82159,electric motor that still puts out 404
6pQoUk4VOx4,82159,84560,horsepower and 640 newton meters of
6pQoUk4VOx4,84560,85920,torque what does this all mean for the
6pQoUk4VOx4,85920,88080,performance well apparently this bentley
6pQoUk4VOx4,88080,90479,can do naught 60 in 5.2 seconds the
6pQoUk4VOx4,90479,92960,range rover is supposed to do it in 5.9
6pQoUk4VOx4,92960,94960,seconds so it seems slower on paper but
6pQoUk4VOx4,94960,96560,is it in reality well we're going to
6pQoUk4VOx4,96560,97759,find out a bit later in this video
6pQoUk4VOx4,97759,99040,because i will be launching them and
6pQoUk4VOx4,99040,101280,we'll see what the truth really is i've
6pQoUk4VOx4,101280,104320,gone really clarkson oh yes in the world
6pQoUk4VOx4,104320,105600,and i saw what these cars like to drive
6pQoUk4VOx4,105600,106960,in town first of all and i'm going to
6pQoUk4VOx4,106960,108880,start with a range rover it will
6pQoUk4VOx4,108880,110159,generally let you just drive along
6pQoUk4VOx4,110159,112560,slowly on electric power alone it suits
6pQoUk4VOx4,112560,113920,this kind of car just in town when
6pQoUk4VOx4,113920,115360,you're just poodling around because it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,115360,117680,silent it's just relaxing i like it the
6pQoUk4VOx4,117680,119200,only issue comes when you suddenly need
6pQoUk4VOx4,119200,121119,to do a maneuver and overtake someone so
6pQoUk4VOx4,121119,123280,you floor the throttle
6pQoUk4VOx4,123280,125360,there you go it does take a while for
6pQoUk4VOx4,125360,128160,the engine the electric motor the
6pQoUk4VOx4,128160,130479,gearbox to all workers one it's almost
6pQoUk4VOx4,130479,132239,as if you're on a zoom call and there's
6pQoUk4VOx4,132239,134000,some kind of like lag with someone's
6pQoUk4VOx4,134000,135920,connection and they just keep freezing
6pQoUk4VOx4,135920,138239,it takes a while for you all to sync up
6pQoUk4VOx4,138239,140720,it's not ideal but it does just about
6pQoUk4VOx4,140720,142800,work and then when you back off again in
6pQoUk4VOx4,142800,144640,electric power you forget all about it
6pQoUk4VOx4,144640,145599,because it's all just relaxed and
6pQoUk4VOx4,145599,147280,chilled again you don't sit quite as
6pQoUk4VOx4,147280,149680,high in this range over sport version as
6pQoUk4VOx4,149680,151680,you do the normal big daddy range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,151680,153920,but it's still a fairly lofty driving
6pQoUk4VOx4,153920,155440,position and it's a bit more
6pQoUk4VOx4,155440,156959,maneuverable than you think it would be
6pQoUk4VOx4,156959,159360,as well easy to do u-turn i'd say what's
6pQoUk4VOx4,159360,160720,good as well the suspension air
6pQoUk4VOx4,160720,163200,suspension deals with bumps nicely only
6pQoUk4VOx4,163200,165360,occasionally do you get a certain like
6pQoUk4VOx4,165360,167519,jolt when there's a real sharp bump but
6pQoUk4VOx4,167519,169440,on the whole it's rather comfortable
6pQoUk4VOx4,169440,171440,even though it's called the sport
6pQoUk4VOx4,171440,172879,the last thing to mention are the brakes
6pQoUk4VOx4,172879,174720,you see the brakes can feel a little bit
6pQoUk4VOx4,174720,176720,grabby sometimes in hybrids because the
6pQoUk4VOx4,176720,178080,first part you're braking actually
6pQoUk4VOx4,178080,179680,recoups lost energy and puts it back
6pQoUk4VOx4,179680,180879,into the battery so you're not actually
6pQoUk4VOx4,180879,182480,using the normal friction brake to slow
6pQoUk4VOx4,182480,184000,down for that first part you're actually
6pQoUk4VOx4,184000,186080,just using the motor in reverse and that
6pQoUk4VOx4,186080,187680,can make the brake pedal feel a bit odd
6pQoUk4VOx4,187680,189040,but the one in this is nice and
6pQoUk4VOx4,189040,190400,consistent
6pQoUk4VOx4,190400,191680,i've jumped out of the range rover and
6pQoUk4VOx4,191680,193920,now i'm in the bentley and just like
6pQoUk4VOx4,193920,196400,with the range over sport it will run in
6pQoUk4VOx4,196400,198239,electric power alone for a certain
6pQoUk4VOx4,198239,200400,distance you get 25 miles if you're very
6pQoUk4VOx4,200400,202560,very careful out of it and when you're
6pQoUk4VOx4,202560,204319,just pooling around it's just electric
6pQoUk4VOx4,204319,206480,only so it's super quiet and dead easy
6pQoUk4VOx4,206480,208159,and relaxing one thing i like about this
6pQoUk4VOx4,208159,210640,bentley though is it lets you know
6pQoUk4VOx4,210640,213360,the transition between being electric
6pQoUk4VOx4,213360,215280,and the internal combustion engine
6pQoUk4VOx4,215280,217040,coming in by actually putting like a
6pQoUk4VOx4,217040,219760,full stop on the throttle pedal so you
6pQoUk4VOx4,219760,221440,feel like you've bottomed out but you
6pQoUk4VOx4,221440,222799,haven't really because that's actually
6pQoUk4VOx4,222799,224959,just for electric power then if you push
6pQoUk4VOx4,224959,226720,past almost like a kick down
6pQoUk4VOx4,226720,228959,when the whole system just wakes up then
6pQoUk4VOx4,228959,231040,and you get full power because the
6pQoUk4VOx4,231040,232799,petrol motor has just sparked into life
6pQoUk4VOx4,232799,234480,and the system works a little bit better
6pQoUk4VOx4,234480,237120,in more harmony than that in the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,237120,238879,rover it's also not quite as noisy when
6pQoUk4VOx4,238879,240159,you put your foot down as well because
6pQoUk4VOx4,240159,241599,you've got a six cylinder engine which
6pQoUk4VOx4,241599,243519,just is bigger and beefer and it's just
6pQoUk4VOx4,243519,245120,got a bit more off so it's a bit more
6pQoUk4VOx4,245120,247040,refined a bit more bentley like see
6pQoUk4VOx4,247040,248560,what's also more bentley like well that
6pQoUk4VOx4,248560,250560,range rover is very comfy this is even
6pQoUk4VOx4,250560,252799,better over bumps i mean it's so good it
6pQoUk4VOx4,252799,254080,just soaks them up i mean you'd be
6pQoUk4VOx4,254080,255519,perfectly fine with a range rover but
6pQoUk4VOx4,255519,257840,this once you've tried this
6pQoUk4VOx4,257840,259919,oh yeah you're gonna want to stay in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,259919,262079,bentley one last thing to assess on the
6pQoUk4VOx4,262079,264639,bentayga brakes yeah they're smooth and
6pQoUk4VOx4,264639,266080,progressive they're not grabby pretty
6pQoUk4VOx4,266080,268080,much as good as the range rovers if
6pQoUk4VOx4,268080,269040,you're going to make the most of these
6pQoUk4VOx4,269040,271280,cars hybrid capabilities you need to
6pQoUk4VOx4,271280,273360,regularly plug them in and charge them
6pQoUk4VOx4,273360,275919,up this is ridiculous anyway
6pQoUk4VOx4,275919,278240,this range rover has a 13 kilowatt hour
6pQoUk4VOx4,278240,280720,battery pack and on a 7 kilowatt charger
6pQoUk4VOx4,280720,283520,it takes two hours 45 minutes to fully
6pQoUk4VOx4,283520,285360,charge the bentayga has a larger battery
6pQoUk4VOx4,285360,287120,pack it's 17 kilowatt hours yet it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,287120,288800,quicker to charge using a seven kilowatt
6pQoUk4VOx4,288800,290560,charger you can do it in two and a half
6pQoUk4VOx4,290560,292639,hours now despite this having the bigger
6pQoUk4VOx4,292639,295120,battery it still does the same 25 miles
6pQoUk4VOx4,295120,297520,of electric only range as the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,297520,299440,rover the problem is though that by
6pQoUk4VOx4,299440,301520,adding batteries and motors these cars
6pQoUk4VOx4,301520,304000,are heavier than their nearest petrol
6pQoUk4VOx4,304000,305840,equivalent for instance this range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,305840,307680,hybrid comes in at two and a half tons
6pQoUk4VOx4,307680,310080,which is about 200 kilos heavier than
6pQoUk4VOx4,310080,312639,the straight six this hybrid bentayga
6pQoUk4VOx4,312639,315360,comes in at 2.6 tons which is about 200
6pQoUk4VOx4,315360,318160,kilos heavier than the v8 version
6pQoUk4VOx4,318160,320240,how does that affect braking speaking of
6pQoUk4VOx4,320240,322240,which this bentayga has 400 millimeter
6pQoUk4VOx4,322240,324000,discs up front and 380 millimeter disc
6pQoUk4VOx4,324000,326080,at the back whereas this range rover has
6pQoUk4VOx4,326080,328400,380 millimeter discs at the front and
6pQoUk4VOx4,328400,330479,365 millimeter disc at the back i think
6pQoUk4VOx4,330479,332080,it's time for a brake test to see how
6pQoUk4VOx4,332080,334400,well these cars stop from 60 miles an
6pQoUk4VOx4,334400,335280,hour
6pQoUk4VOx4,335280,336320,okay now i'm going to do a full
6pQoUk4VOx4,336320,338639,emergency stop from 60 miles an hour see
6pQoUk4VOx4,338639,340479,how long it takes to stop this big heavy
6pQoUk4VOx4,340479,343360,car braking now
6pQoUk4VOx4,343360,345680,oh
6pQoUk4VOx4,345919,349120,it took 35 meters now let's try the
6pQoUk4VOx4,349120,351440,bentley okay now i'm gonna break test
6pQoUk4VOx4,351440,353520,the bentayga see if it can do better
6pQoUk4VOx4,353520,355520,than the range rover sport what's it
6pQoUk4VOx4,355520,357918,gonna do
6pQoUk4VOx4,360800,363280,that's felt pretty good oh yes stop from
6pQoUk4VOx4,363280,366400,60 in 33 meters so better than the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,366400,369120,rover those two meters could be vital
6pQoUk4VOx4,369120,370639,hey just wanted to interrupt the video
6pQoUk4VOx4,370639,372720,to give you some news you can now sell
6pQoUk4VOx4,372720,374960,your car through carway all you have to

6pQoUk4VOx4,385360,386960,and take your car away and give you the
6pQoUk4VOx4,386960,388400,cash now if you want to sell your car
6pQoUk4VOx4,388400,389600,through car wow click on the pop-up
6pQoUk4VOx4,389600,390880,banner up there for the link in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,390880,393600,description below it's dead easy
6pQoUk4VOx4,393600,395120,now let's talk about the design of these
6pQoUk4VOx4,395120,397440,cars starting with the front so the
6pQoUk4VOx4,397440,400319,range over sport it's just a very simple
6pQoUk4VOx4,400319,402800,good looking suv looks expensive but
6pQoUk4VOx4,402800,404319,it's not too in your face and showy
6pQoUk4VOx4,404319,406240,unlike the bentley which is definitely
6pQoUk4VOx4,406240,407759,showy especially when you go for the
6pQoUk4VOx4,407759,410160,chrome grille say chrome it's chrome
6pQoUk4VOx4,410160,412560,paint because this grille is all plastic
6pQoUk4VOx4,412560,413840,i do like the lights of the bentley
6pQoUk4VOx4,413840,416960,though very very smart and like jewelry
6pQoUk4VOx4,416960,419280,like however overall i think that the
6pQoUk4VOx4,419280,421280,range rover has the better looking face
6pQoUk4VOx4,421280,423280,that's just a little bit weird
6pQoUk4VOx4,423280,425360,thankfully the bentayga is much better
6pQoUk4VOx4,425360,428240,looking from the side the chrome really
6pQoUk4VOx4,428240,429919,works here actually it just highlights
6pQoUk4VOx4,429919,432160,the body and the shapes and contours in
6pQoUk4VOx4,432160,434080,the metal work and i love this kind of
6pQoUk4VOx4,434080,435599,pronounced rear haunches it looks
6pQoUk4VOx4,435599,436960,muscular
6pQoUk4VOx4,436960,438479,also on the hybrid version you can have
6pQoUk4VOx4,438479,440720,wheel sizes up to 22 inches whereas on
6pQoUk4VOx4,440720,442880,the range rover hybrid version maximum
6pQoUk4VOx4,442880,445680,size is 21 inches one inch less can make
6pQoUk4VOx4,445680,447039,all the difference the shape of the
6pQoUk4VOx4,447039,448880,range rover is classic it's quite boxy
6pQoUk4VOx4,448880,451120,but it looks good as good as the ben
6pQoUk4VOx4,451120,452560,taker
6pQoUk4VOx4,452560,453680,i think from the side i prefer the
6pQoUk4VOx4,453680,456080,bentayga finally let's compare the back
6pQoUk4VOx4,456080,458000,ends of these cars now i like the rear
6pQoUk4VOx4,458000,459360,of this bentayga it's sort of like a
6pQoUk4VOx4,459360,461199,continental gt that's been jacked up
6pQoUk4VOx4,461199,463440,slightly the range rover it's okay
6pQoUk4VOx4,463440,465680,there's something slightly bulbous about
6pQoUk4VOx4,465680,468400,it a bit like a baboon on heat also
6pQoUk4VOx4,468400,470080,there's some fakery going on as i'll
6pQoUk4VOx4,470080,472400,illustrate now with my rimac
6pQoUk4VOx4,472400,474639,sticker truth so that's a fake diffuser
6pQoUk4VOx4,474639,476800,there and these exhaust surrounds not
6pQoUk4VOx4,476800,477919,exactly fake they're more of an
6pQoUk4VOx4,477919,479440,exaggeration because it's got these
6pQoUk4VOx4,479440,481039,single little exhaust pipes in there
6pQoUk4VOx4,481039,482479,whereas those on the bend take it each
6pQoUk4VOx4,482479,484639,have a real exhaust pipe in those
6pQoUk4VOx4,484639,486160,openings i think they're a bit better in
6pQoUk4VOx4,486160,489039,terms of pricing though this thing's 155
6pQoUk4VOx4,489039,491919,000 pounds starting this 75 grand and i
6pQoUk4VOx4,491919,493680,don't think the bentayga looks twice as
6pQoUk4VOx4,493680,495440,expensive as the range rover do you

6pQoUk4VOx4,510479,512240,trusted dealers it's here on the inside
6pQoUk4VOx4,512240,514159,where the bentley starts to feel twice
6pQoUk4VOx4,514159,516880,as expensive as the range rover it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,516880,517839,just
6pQoUk4VOx4,517839,520880,lovely in it absolutely gorgeous just
6pQoUk4VOx4,520880,524159,the material quality the design in italy
6pQoUk4VOx4,524159,525920,this does have the ten thousand pound
6pQoUk4VOx4,525920,527519,mulliner pack which includes like
6pQoUk4VOx4,527519,529440,quilted stitching on the seats these
6pQoUk4VOx4,529440,531680,lovely aluminium pedals and bit more
6pQoUk4VOx4,531680,533920,diamond quilting us here on the doors
6pQoUk4VOx4,533920,536399,great a few buttons feel a little bit
6pQoUk4VOx4,536399,537360,kind of
6pQoUk4VOx4,537360,539360,cheap for such an expensive car but
6pQoUk4VOx4,539360,542320,overall it's just exquisite infotainment
6pQoUk4VOx4,542320,544240,system's good as well it's not the best
6pQoUk4VOx4,544240,546160,in the world but it's pretty simple and
6pQoUk4VOx4,546160,547680,easy to use and you've got a digital
6pQoUk4VOx4,547680,549839,driver's display which is nice i love
6pQoUk4VOx4,549839,552720,bentley interiors oh look
6pQoUk4VOx4,552720,554320,leathery nuts oh
6pQoUk4VOx4,554320,555600,and
6pQoUk4VOx4,555600,557519,a double sun visor
6pQoUk4VOx4,557519,559760,that's worth the asking price alone now
6pQoUk4VOx4,559760,561120,while the inside of the range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,561120,563680,isn't quite as luxury as that bentayga
6pQoUk4VOx4,563680,565920,it's still very very nice material
6pQoUk4VOx4,565920,567760,quality is good the layer is pretty
6pQoUk4VOx4,567760,569279,clean i actually think the buttons on
6pQoUk4VOx4,569279,570640,the steering wheel look more expensive
6pQoUk4VOx4,570640,573680,but they're absolute arse to use these
6pQoUk4VOx4,573680,575839,touch sensitive buttons which also
6pQoUk4VOx4,575839,577360,operate when you press them in as well
6pQoUk4VOx4,577360,578720,it's so confusing and the whole
6pQoUk4VOx4,578720,580240,infotainment system in this range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,580240,581760,is just not as good as in the bentley
6pQoUk4VOx4,581760,583440,the digital driver's display is a little
6pQoUk4VOx4,583440,585519,bit more confusing and harder to set up
6pQoUk4VOx4,585519,586959,just as you want it and the main
6pQoUk4VOx4,586959,588399,infotainment screen just isn't as
6pQoUk4VOx4,588399,590880,responsive or as easy to use
6pQoUk4VOx4,590880,592000,wait a minute
6pQoUk4VOx4,592000,593600,this car's average economy figure is
6pQoUk4VOx4,593600,595600,saying 23 miles per gallon yeah the
6pQoUk4VOx4,595600,596720,plug-in hybrid version of the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,596720,598560,rover sport is supposed to do over 80
6pQoUk4VOx4,598560,600720,miles per gallon same with the bentayga
6pQoUk4VOx4,600720,602880,yet that's only averaging 25 miles per
6pQoUk4VOx4,602880,604000,gallon you see with these plug-in
6pQoUk4VOx4,604000,605760,hybrids unless you constantly plug them
6pQoUk4VOx4,605760,607680,in and use them on electric power you
6pQoUk4VOx4,607680,610000,get nowhere near the claimed economy
6pQoUk4VOx4,610000,611760,figures so what's the point of them well
6pQoUk4VOx4,611760,613360,most people don't buy these for their
6pQoUk4VOx4,613360,615120,economy they buy them because you can
6pQoUk4VOx4,615120,618160,save a stack of cash on company car tax
6pQoUk4VOx4,618160,620240,for instance the company car tax bill
6pQoUk4VOx4,620240,621839,for this plug-in hybrid version of the
6pQoUk4VOx4,621839,623920,range rover sport will work out in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,623920,626959,uk for a high rate taxpayer to about 500
6pQoUk4VOx4,626959,629440,pounds a month if you to have the normal
6pQoUk4VOx4,629440,631760,petrol three liter straight six that'll
6pQoUk4VOx4,631760,633760,cost you about 900 pounds a month in
6pQoUk4VOx4,633760,636160,company car tax so you're saving a ton
6pQoUk4VOx4,636160,637680,of cash just because it's a plug-in
6pQoUk4VOx4,637680,640079,hybrid and therefore has lower emissions
6pQoUk4VOx4,640079,641680,same with the bentayga so that plug-in
6pQoUk4VOx4,641680,643040,hybrid version of the bentayga it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,643040,644160,going to cost you about a thousand
6pQoUk4VOx4,644160,645440,pounds in company car tax if you're a
6pQoUk4VOx4,645440,647519,high rate taxpayer get the va that'd be
6pQoUk4VOx4,647519,649360,2 000 pounds a month that's the main
6pQoUk4VOx4,649360,651200,reason people buy these plug-in hybrids
6pQoUk4VOx4,651200,653519,not to save the environment and most
6pQoUk4VOx4,653519,654959,people who buy these cars will spend a
6pQoUk4VOx4,654959,656240,lot of time on the motorway where
6pQoUk4VOx4,656240,658000,they'll never use any of their electric
6pQoUk4VOx4,658000,659440,power at all they'll just be running off
6pQoUk4VOx4,659440,660800,their internal combustion engine
6pQoUk4VOx4,660800,661920,speaking of which let's see what they
6pQoUk4VOx4,661920,664000,like to drive on the motorway this range
6pQoUk4VOx4,664000,666480,over sport is lovely it's very comfy
6pQoUk4VOx4,666480,668720,these seats the armrests just at the
6pQoUk4VOx4,668720,670800,right height they're just chilling and
6pQoUk4VOx4,670800,672800,just soaking up the miles now you can
6pQoUk4VOx4,672800,673920,actually drive an electric power at
6pQoUk4VOx4,673920,676079,motorway speeds but you'll soon rinse
6pQoUk4VOx4,676079,677440,through your battery press the hold
6pQoUk4VOx4,677440,678959,button and then it will just hold the
6pQoUk4VOx4,678959,681600,charge so you can keep some battery for
6pQoUk4VOx4,681600,683120,when you're in town
6pQoUk4VOx4,683120,684480,another thing you can do actually is
6pQoUk4VOx4,684480,686880,just use the optional cruise control
6pQoUk4VOx4,686880,688480,system to just take the strain out of
6pQoUk4VOx4,688480,691040,the driving now it costs over 2 000
6pQoUk4VOx4,691040,692320,pounds part of an option pack but it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,692320,694000,fairly decent and it'll keep you safe
6pQoUk4VOx4,694000,695760,distance from the car in front and auto
6pQoUk4VOx4,695760,698240,steer as well so you can just chill i
6pQoUk4VOx4,698240,699680,don't think it's the best system on the
6pQoUk4VOx4,699680,701360,market hooking you up to the center of
6pQoUk4VOx4,701360,703360,the lane but it's good enough and it
6pQoUk4VOx4,703360,704480,just takes a strain out of long
6pQoUk4VOx4,704480,706399,distances and speaking of which this is
6pQoUk4VOx4,706399,709440,quite a big square looking car you do
6pQoUk4VOx4,709440,711360,get a bit of wind noise because it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,711360,713519,got quite big wing mirrors and it's got
6pQoUk4VOx4,713519,715839,this big flat front as well but on the
6pQoUk4VOx4,715839,717839,whole it's pretty blooming quite in here
6pQoUk4VOx4,717839,719120,and comfy
6pQoUk4VOx4,719120,722399,lovely can the bentley be any better
6pQoUk4VOx4,722399,724079,on the motorway now with the bentayga
6pQoUk4VOx4,724079,725519,it's got automatic cruise control with
6pQoUk4VOx4,725519,727040,lane keeping assist though that is part
6pQoUk4VOx4,727040,729120,of a six thousand pound pack it is
6pQoUk4VOx4,729120,731440,slightly better than that in the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,731440,732959,rover but they're both really good and
6pQoUk4VOx4,732959,734240,i'd always want them fitted if you're
6pQoUk4VOx4,734240,736000,doing lots of motorway miles and lots of
6pQoUk4VOx4,736000,737680,motorway miles in this bentayga or even
6pQoUk4VOx4,737680,739200,more relaxing i think it's ever so
6pQoUk4VOx4,739200,742000,slightly quieter that suspension is just
6pQoUk4VOx4,742000,744560,that little bit better is it
6pQoUk4VOx4,744560,746399,significantly better as the price
6pQoUk4VOx4,746399,748000,suggests no there's not that much
6pQoUk4VOx4,748000,750000,difference in it but this does just
6pQoUk4VOx4,750000,752000,about have the edge but then so it
6pQoUk4VOx4,752000,753600,should of this bryce thing about
6pQoUk4VOx4,753600,755600,bentleys is that only good for driving
6pQoUk4VOx4,755600,757600,yourself but also for being driven in
6pQoUk4VOx4,757600,759200,you could use the bentayga as a
6pQoUk4VOx4,759200,760399,chauffeur car because there's loads of
6pQoUk4VOx4,760399,761519,room here in the back lock and you can
6pQoUk4VOx4,761519,763920,slide the rear seats and you can recline
6pQoUk4VOx4,763920,765680,them you can even carry three people in
6pQoUk4VOx4,765680,767279,the back at once because this central
6pQoUk4VOx4,767279,769040,seat is quite wide there is a bit of a
6pQoUk4VOx4,769040,770399,lump in the floor but it doesn't matter
6pQoUk4VOx4,770399,771839,too much because there's loads of foot
6pQoUk4VOx4,771839,773040,space another good thing about the
6pQoUk4VOx4,773040,775200,bentayga is that it's really good for
6pQoUk4VOx4,775200,777040,carrying babies because it's still
6pQoUk4VOx4,777040,778320,easier it's a matter of babysitting this
6pQoUk4VOx4,778320,779920,car the ice fix anchor point so you can
6pQoUk4VOx4,779920,780959,just get too easy because you just
6pQoUk4VOx4,780959,782560,remove some covers and there's loads of
6pQoUk4VOx4,782560,783920,room to even fit one of those bulky
6pQoUk4VOx4,783920,786160,rear-facing seats here in the back i
6pQoUk4VOx4,786160,787200,think i've noticed in this guy's this
6pQoUk4VOx4,787200,789760,look picnic tables for your children or
6pQoUk4VOx4,789760,791279,maybe to do a bit of work on me being
6pQoUk4VOx4,791279,793440,chauffeured lovely mechanism on them but
6pQoUk4VOx4,793440,795600,then it should be because believe it or
6pQoUk4VOx4,795600,796560,not
6pQoUk4VOx4,796560,799040,these picnic tables they cost
6pQoUk4VOx4,799040,801600,1700 pounds
6pQoUk4VOx4,801600,803920,oh no thanks i think i'll eat in rather
6pQoUk4VOx4,803920,805279,than take away
6pQoUk4VOx4,805279,807279,at the back of the range rover sport you
6pQoUk4VOx4,807279,808959,can recline the seats like in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,808959,810480,bentayga but you can't slide them
6pQoUk4VOx4,810480,812079,forwards or backwards
6pQoUk4VOx4,812079,814480,however you do have a flat floor so
6pQoUk4VOx4,814480,816000,there's more foot space if you need to
6pQoUk4VOx4,816000,817600,carry three in the back at once though
6pQoUk4VOx4,817600,820560,the central seat isn't quite as comfy as
6pQoUk4VOx4,820560,822320,in the bentley
6pQoUk4VOx4,822320,824160,also it's hard to fit a child seat in
6pQoUk4VOx4,824160,826160,the back of this range rover sport part
6pQoUk4VOx4,826160,827360,of the problem is the fact that the ice
6pQoUk4VOx4,827360,828800,fix anchor point is a bit harder to get
6pQoUk4VOx4,828800,830639,to because there's no flip off covers
6pQoUk4VOx4,830639,832480,and there's not quite as much room back
6pQoUk4VOx4,832480,834000,here so you do have to push the front
6pQoUk4VOx4,834000,835920,passenger seat forward a bit to fit a
6pQoUk4VOx4,835920,838079,bulky rear facing seat and overall it's
6pQoUk4VOx4,838079,839920,not quite as roomy for knee room as that
6pQoUk4VOx4,839920,841760,bentayga it's a slightly bigger car the
6pQoUk4VOx4,841760,844320,bentley though i guess that if you want
6pQoUk4VOx4,844320,846079,even more space you could just get the
6pQoUk4VOx4,846079,848000,normal range rover hybrid in fact if you
6pQoUk4VOx4,848000,849199,want to see my fault in depth video
6pQoUk4VOx4,849199,850720,review of that car click on the pop-out
6pQoUk4VOx4,850720,852800,banner up there or for the link in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,852800,854880,description though obviously the big
6pQoUk4VOx4,854880,856959,range rover isn't quite as sporty as the
6pQoUk4VOx4,856959,859279,sport anyway speaking of sporty let's do
6pQoUk4VOx4,859279,861839,some sporty driving in these sporty suvs
6pQoUk4VOx4,861839,863600,both of these suvs are supposed to have
6pQoUk4VOx4,863600,865600,a sporty element to them so let's see
6pQoUk4VOx4,865600,867519,how will they handle on a twisty road
6pQoUk4VOx4,867519,869519,i've got this range over sport in its
6pQoUk4VOx4,869519,871120,sportiest setting so it's stiffened at
6pQoUk4VOx4,871120,873040,the suspension it's shot in the throttle
6pQoUk4VOx4,873040,875760,response made the engine motor gearbox
6pQoUk4VOx4,875760,877920,combo a bit more responsive and it does
6pQoUk4VOx4,877920,878959,an all right job of going around the
6pQoUk4VOx4,878959,881120,corners of this stays relatively flat
6pQoUk4VOx4,881120,882480,but there's no getting away from the
6pQoUk4VOx4,882480,884800,fact it is a big range rover so it never
6pQoUk4VOx4,884800,887440,feels fully sporty and the hybrid
6pQoUk4VOx4,887440,889440,version is even less sporty than normal
6pQoUk4VOx4,889440,891279,because it just carries more weight if
6pQoUk4VOx4,891279,893680,you compare this to the three liter
6pQoUk4VOx4,893680,895519,straight six petrol which has the same
6pQoUk4VOx4,895519,897920,power it's 200 kilos heavier because of
6pQoUk4VOx4,897920,900160,the battery and the motor and as a
6pQoUk4VOx4,900160,901360,result it just doesn't feel too
6pQoUk4VOx4,901360,902800,responsive when you're driving it it's a
6pQoUk4VOx4,902800,904560,bit of a shame that now let's see if the
6pQoUk4VOx4,904560,906320,bentley feels a bit sportier than the
6pQoUk4VOx4,906320,909120,range rover sport so got it in dynamic
6pQoUk4VOx4,909120,911279,mode and this is even heavier than the
6pQoUk4VOx4,911279,914240,range rover it's 2.6 tons but somehow it
6pQoUk4VOx4,914240,915600,hides its weight i've got a bit more
6pQoUk4VOx4,915600,917680,faith in the handling but yet again just
6pQoUk4VOx4,917680,919440,like with the hybrid version of the
6pQoUk4VOx4,919440,921519,range rover this thing is about 200
6pQoUk4VOx4,921519,923760,kilos heavier than the equivalent
6pQoUk4VOx4,923760,926000,powered v8 model as a result it just
6pQoUk4VOx4,926000,927839,doesn't feel quite as lively doesn't
6pQoUk4VOx4,927839,929839,feel as short-footed and it's got the
6pQoUk4VOx4,929839,931839,whole thing where you've got the motor
6pQoUk4VOx4,931839,933440,the gearbox and the internal combustion
6pQoUk4VOx4,933440,936079,engine have to work in sync to give you
6pQoUk4VOx4,936079,938079,smooth effortless progress and it's just
6pQoUk4VOx4,938079,939519,not quite as good as just having the
6pQoUk4VOx4,939519,941199,gearbox and the v8 engine like you do
6pQoUk4VOx4,941199,943920,the v8 version of this bentayga for me
6pQoUk4VOx4,943920,946560,hybrids are always a compromise they add
6pQoUk4VOx4,946560,948800,weight to your vehicle they just aren't
6pQoUk4VOx4,948800,950959,quite so smooth to drive they are in
6pQoUk4VOx4,950959,952880,fact the worst of all worlds the only
6pQoUk4VOx4,952880,955040,real reason to have them is for that tax
6pQoUk4VOx4,955040,957120,benefit as far as i'm concerned but hey
6pQoUk4VOx4,957120,958639,if you get one as a company car you save
6pQoUk4VOx4,958639,960160,so much money with them and if you can't
6pQoUk4VOx4,960160,961519,plug them in and you're just pooping
6pQoUk4VOx4,961519,962880,around town then you can just use them
6pQoUk4VOx4,962880,964320,like an electric vehicle but they're
6pQoUk4VOx4,964320,965600,just not as good as an electric vehicle
6pQoUk4VOx4,965600,966720,because in an electric vehicle you want
6pQoUk4VOx4,966720,968480,to accelerate you floor it and you take
6pQoUk4VOx4,968480,970320,off immediately with this it has to
6pQoUk4VOx4,970320,972480,pause and think for a while not quite as
6pQoUk4VOx4,972480,975440,bad as in the range rover but still not
6pQoUk4VOx4,975440,977440,perfect and while this does sound better
6pQoUk4VOx4,977440,978720,than range rover it doesn't sound as
6pQoUk4VOx4,978720,981040,good as the v8 version
6pQoUk4VOx4,981040,982560,now let's talk about the boot capacities
6pQoUk4VOx4,982560,984639,of these cars so on paper the range
6pQoUk4VOx4,984639,986440,rover has a bigger boot
6pQoUk4VOx4,986440,988920,573 litres compared to
6pQoUk4VOx4,988920,992320,479 liters for the bentayga however all
6pQoUk4VOx4,992320,994079,is not what it seems because i think
6pQoUk4VOx4,994079,996320,that land rover actually measures the
6pQoUk4VOx4,996320,998480,boot capacity of this car all the way to
6pQoUk4VOx4,998480,1000720,the roof line whereas in the bentayga
6pQoUk4VOx4,1000720,1002800,bentley measure it up to the window line
6pQoUk4VOx4,1002800,1005040,because while these boots pretty much
6pQoUk4VOx4,1005040,1006880,have the same width the bin takers is
6pQoUk4VOx4,1006880,1009680,deeper and it's taller also being
6pQoUk4VOx4,1009680,1011600,hybrids they both have their batteries
6pQoUk4VOx4,1011600,1013199,underneath the boot floor doesn't really
6pQoUk4VOx4,1013199,1014240,make that much difference to the
6pQoUk4VOx4,1014240,1016000,capacity of the hybrid version of the
6pQoUk4VOx4,1016000,1017839,bentayga it's only a few liters less
6pQoUk4VOx4,1017839,1019759,than the petrol version whereas you can
6pQoUk4VOx4,1019759,1021920,see this ridge on the range rover there
6pQoUk4VOx4,1021920,1023600,and its batteries reduce the boot
6pQoUk4VOx4,1023600,1024400,capacity
6pQoUk4VOx4,1024400,1026640,of the range rover sport by about 50
6pQoUk4VOx4,1026640,1028640,liters over the petrol car in terms of
6pQoUk4VOx4,1028640,1029918,tone capability because you might want
6pQoUk4VOx4,1029918,1032319,to tell with these cars this can tow 2.5
6pQoUk4VOx4,1032319,1035839,turns whereas this can tow 3.5 tonnes
6pQoUk4VOx4,1035839,1037280,and speaking of pulling power let's
6pQoUk4VOx4,1037280,1039120,launch the cars this range rover spot
6pQoUk4VOx4,1039120,1041839,hybrid is supposed to do 960 in 5.9
6pQoUk4VOx4,1041839,1043199,seconds but let's see what the
6pQoUk4VOx4,1043199,1045360,specialist tommy gear says about that
6pQoUk4VOx4,1045360,1048240,and launch it here we go
6pQoUk4VOx4,1048240,1051280,don't know what that was in the back
6pQoUk4VOx4,1051520,1054480,actually took off pretty well
6pQoUk4VOx4,1055360,1058640,5.5 seconds that's impressive and that
6pQoUk4VOx4,1058640,1060799,jumped into the bentayga and on paper it
6pQoUk4VOx4,1060799,1062400,is supposed to be quicker so let's do it
6pQoUk4VOx4,1062400,1064559,in 5.2 seconds but what's the reality
6pQoUk4VOx4,1064559,1066480,going to be like let's do this and find
6pQoUk4VOx4,1066480,1068720,out
6pQoUk4VOx4,1069679,1072160,doesn't really feel any quicker
6pQoUk4VOx4,1072160,1075280,but what will the numbers say
6pQoUk4VOx4,1075280,1079360,there's really nothing in it not 60 5.52
6pQoUk4VOx4,1079360,1082640,so not as quick as bentley say and only
6pQoUk4VOx4,1082640,1086500,marginally quicker than the range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,1086500,1094160,[Music]
6pQoUk4VOx4,1094160,1096559,so then what's my final verdict well if
6pQoUk4VOx4,1096559,1098400,you're going for the hybrid version of
6pQoUk4VOx4,1098400,1100160,these cars you're doing it to save money
6pQoUk4VOx4,1100160,1102240,in terms of company car tax and while
6pQoUk4VOx4,1102240,1104240,the bentley is better in every single
6pQoUk4VOx4,1104240,1106160,way than the range rover sport apart
6pQoUk4VOx4,1106160,1108799,from maybe it's face it's not
6pQoUk4VOx4,1108799,1110799,twice as good yet it's twice the price
6pQoUk4VOx4,1110799,1111760,so
6pQoUk4VOx4,1111760,1113440,do you know what i think the range rover
6pQoUk4VOx4,1113440,1114880,comes close in terms of luxury in the
6pQoUk4VOx4,1114880,1116880,way it is to drive to the bentayga but
6pQoUk4VOx4,1116880,1118960,it's a whole lot cheaper and that's why
6pQoUk4VOx4,1118960,1122000,it wins this test
6pQoUk4VOx4,1122000,1123360,i hope you enjoyed the video if you did
6pQoUk4VOx4,1123360,1125120,give it a like if you don't agree with
