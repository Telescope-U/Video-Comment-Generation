k8RkyaSHFLM,47,1200,- You might not like it
k8RkyaSHFLM,1200,4040,but this is what peak performance looks like
k8RkyaSHFLM,4040,6859,"And it is chonky, yeah."
k8RkyaSHFLM,6860,9225,Kind of reminds me of a stubby G4 Cube.
k8RkyaSHFLM,9225,11910,The Mac studio and matching studio display
k8RkyaSHFLM,11910,14050,are the two latest announcements out of Apple
k8RkyaSHFLM,14050,15235,and of everything they announced today
k8RkyaSHFLM,15235,18699,they're easily the most exciting
k8RkyaSHFLM,18700,20660,both powered by Apple Silicon
k8RkyaSHFLM,20660,23300,they're set to usher in a new era performance
k8RkyaSHFLM,23300,25509,for apple enthusiasts
k8RkyaSHFLM,25510,27170,but the way Apple's gone about this
k8RkyaSHFLM,27170,30130,makes things so much more complicated
k8RkyaSHFLM,30130,32040,unlike our sponsor Ridge wallet.
k8RkyaSHFLM,32040,34390,Thanks to Ridge wallet for sponsoring today's video.
k8RkyaSHFLM,34390,36260,Ridge wallet holds up to 12 cards
k8RkyaSHFLM,36260,38219,comes with a cash strap or a money clip
k8RkyaSHFLM,38220,40520,and is available in tons of different colors
k8RkyaSHFLM,40520,42160,celebrate Ridge's ninth anniversary
k8RkyaSHFLM,42160,43270,and use offer code Linus
k8RkyaSHFLM,43270,45768,for 15% off site wide until March 18th
k8RkyaSHFLM,45768,47194,at the link below.
k8RkyaSHFLM,47194,50611,(playful cheerful music)
k8RkyaSHFLM,57210,59629,The new max studio is in every way
k8RkyaSHFLM,59630,62290,what we all feared the Mac pro would become
k8RkyaSHFLM,62290,65040,when apple started the transition to Apple Silicon
k8RkyaSHFLM,65040,66980,an entirely unexpandable design
k8RkyaSHFLM,66980,69630,with fully solder components in a Mac mini enclosure
k8RkyaSHFLM,69630,71939,that decided to make a little taller than usual
k8RkyaSHFLM,71940,75040,cooled by two beefy fans that pull air up
k8RkyaSHFLM,75040,76220,through the bottom of the chassis
k8RkyaSHFLM,76220,77610,and out to the rear grill
k8RkyaSHFLM,77610,79670,something Apple says is nearly silent
k8RkyaSHFLM,79670,82479,there's actually a lot going for this design.
k8RkyaSHFLM,82480,85810,For starters you get 10 gigabit ethernet as standard.
k8RkyaSHFLM,85810,87448,Thank you Apple.
k8RkyaSHFLM,87448,90210,Now the rest of the rear IO is rearranged
k8RkyaSHFLM,90210,92450,but looks basically the same as the Intel Mac mini
k8RkyaSHFLM,92450,95200,with a high impedance pro audio output
k8RkyaSHFLM,95200,96689,that I suspect is the same
k8RkyaSHFLM,96690,98150,as on the new MacBook pros
k8RkyaSHFLM,98150,99610,turn it around however
k8RkyaSHFLM,99610,101730,and you'll see that Apple has finally
k8RkyaSHFLM,101730,105040,acquiesced added front facing connectors
k8RkyaSHFLM,105040,107070,two USB type C 10 gigabit ports
k8RkyaSHFLM,107070,109180,and an SDX C reader
k8RkyaSHFLM,109180,111730,while support from a brand new SD express format
k8RkyaSHFLM,111730,112830,would've been nice to see
k8RkyaSHFLM,112830,115020,as a future proofing measure
k8RkyaSHFLM,115020,118188,what we're getting tracks with the larger MacBook pros.
k8RkyaSHFLM,118189,121410,If you pick up an M1 ultra equipped max studio
k8RkyaSHFLM,121410,122420,those types C ports
k8RkyaSHFLM,122420,125220,up front turn into Thunderbolt ports
k8RkyaSHFLM,125220,126053,wait
k8RkyaSHFLM,127114,129246,M1 ultra
k8RkyaSHFLM,129246,132120,Yeah turns out Apple's been holding out on us
k8RkyaSHFLM,132120,135190,and their M1 max chips had an unused interconnect
k8RkyaSHFLM,135190,136370,called ultra fusion
k8RkyaSHFLM,136370,138099,that allows for a chip style connection
k8RkyaSHFLM,138100,141708,between two M1 maxes to make up an M1 ultra
k8RkyaSHFLM,141708,143969,the effective result is a single SOC
k8RkyaSHFLM,143970,145212,as far as software is concerned
k8RkyaSHFLM,145212,149280,and gives a metric bug load of CPU and GPU cores
k8RkyaSHFLM,149280,151920,double the already very impressive media engine
k8RkyaSHFLM,151920,155620,on the M1 max and twice the maximum memory capacity
k8RkyaSHFLM,155620,157299,at 800 gigabytes per second
k8RkyaSHFLM,157300,159220,that is faster memory
k8RkyaSHFLM,159220,161150,than the GDR 6X
k8RkyaSHFLM,161150,164713,that is used on Avid RTX 3080 and 3090.
k8RkyaSHFLM,165960,168193,That is pretty amazing
k8RkyaSHFLM,168193,169829,and even more amazing
k8RkyaSHFLM,169830,172260,as the memory itself isn't even clocked faster.
k8RkyaSHFLM,172260,174790,There's just that many more channels to work with.
k8RkyaSHFLM,174790,176760,If you believe what Apple has to say
k8RkyaSHFLM,176760,179260,the M1 ultra is up to 60% faster
k8RkyaSHFLM,179260,182265,than the Mac pro equipped with 28 Zion W cores
k8RkyaSHFLM,182266,184643,and 80% faster than that machine's fastest GPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,184643,187920,the Radeon W6900X.
k8RkyaSHFLM,187920,189680,They still sell those by the way
k8RkyaSHFLM,189680,192209,something about those claims though
k8RkyaSHFLM,192210,194196,it doesn't really pass the sniff test.
k8RkyaSHFLM,194196,195900,Part of that claim is that
k8RkyaSHFLM,195900,200430,it's also 90% faster than a 16 core desktop CPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,200430,202849,while drawing a hundred Watts less power
k8RkyaSHFLM,202850,204100,you might think that's referring
k8RkyaSHFLM,204100,206302,to the only current 16 core desktop CPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,206302,208550,the rise in 95950X
k8RkyaSHFLM,208550,213040,but in fact they're talking about the core i9-12900K
k8RkyaSHFLM,213040,214829,which is an eight plus eight core CPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,214830,216340,with performance and efficiency cores
k8RkyaSHFLM,216340,217668,much like Apple Silicon.
k8RkyaSHFLM,217668,222668,what's more Max Turbo Power on the 12900K is 241 Watts.
k8RkyaSHFLM,222890,224430,So we can surmise based
k8RkyaSHFLM,224430,226870,on Apple's own data that the M1 ultra draws
k8RkyaSHFLM,226870,228569,around 140 Watts
k8RkyaSHFLM,228570,229970,which is still a lot of Watts.
k8RkyaSHFLM,229970,233580,The 12900K is TDP at base clock is 125 Watts
k8RkyaSHFLM,233580,235440,and I can guarantee you M1 ultra
k8RkyaSHFLM,235440,238350,doesn't draw just 25 Watts
k8RkyaSHFLM,238350,240570,but that's the CPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,240570,242640,128 gigs of unified memory
k8RkyaSHFLM,242640,247210,offers an unprecedented amount of potential VERA to the GPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,247210,249390,Apple is right in that the biggest workstation card
k8RkyaSHFLM,249390,250310,on the market right now
k8RkyaSHFLM,250310,254229,the RTX A6000 caps out a meager 48 gigs.
k8RkyaSHFLM,254229,257150,Sure you can connect multiple as six thousands together
k8RkyaSHFLM,257150,260889,via NVlink but having that much memory in a single package
k8RkyaSHFLM,260890,263320,is a significant feather in Apple's cap.
k8RkyaSHFLM,263320,265080,They're also making some interesting claims
k8RkyaSHFLM,265080,267121,about beating the highest end discrete GPU
k8RkyaSHFLM,267122,270580,while also using 200 Watts less power though
k8RkyaSHFLM,270580,271419,the footnote says
k8RkyaSHFLM,271420,273370,they're talking about the RTX 3090
k8RkyaSHFLM,273370,275860,using select industry standard benchmarks.
k8RkyaSHFLM,275860,277520,So take from that what you will
k8RkyaSHFLM,277520,280190,I expect performance will be decent either way
k8RkyaSHFLM,280190,281470,but it it's very possible
k8RkyaSHFLM,281470,285100,this specific claim leans on the media engine
k8RkyaSHFLM,285100,286500,as Apple has done in the past
k8RkyaSHFLM,286500,288660,and they're not talking about raw compute performance.
k8RkyaSHFLM,288660,290920,I'd like to be wrong though.
k8RkyaSHFLM,290920,293740,Speaking of the doubled up media engine is now capable
k8RkyaSHFLM,293740,297569,"of running 18 simultaneous 8K ProRes, 422 streams."
k8RkyaSHFLM,297570,299180,So it really does sound
k8RkyaSHFLM,299180,301949,like an ideal workstation for most professionals
k8RkyaSHFLM,301950,304520,especially as software support comes online
k8RkyaSHFLM,304520,305974,like with blender 3.1
k8RkyaSHFLM,305975,307820,you'll be able to make use of it too
k8RkyaSHFLM,307820,309460,up to four pro display XDR
k8RkyaSHFLM,309460,311867,and a 4K HDMI device simultaneously
k8RkyaSHFLM,311868,314260,that is more battle stations
k8RkyaSHFLM,314260,315870,certainly more pixels
k8RkyaSHFLM,315870,318501,than Apple has ever officially supported.
k8RkyaSHFLM,318501,321950,Internal storage doesn't look expandable however
k8RkyaSHFLM,321950,324630,"So you'll need to add over $2,000"
k8RkyaSHFLM,326262,330490,for 8 terabytes if you don't want external storage
k8RkyaSHFLM,330490,332435,a fact made worse by recent revelations
k8RkyaSHFLM,332435,334145,that Apple's SSD performance
k8RkyaSHFLM,334145,336560,isn't as good as they claim it is.
k8RkyaSHFLM,336560,337393,They're cheating
k8RkyaSHFLM,337393,339280,"and in the process, putting data at risk"
k8RkyaSHFLM,339280,340676,if an unexpected shutdown occurs
k8RkyaSHFLM,340676,342490,the onboard battery
k8RkyaSHFLM,342490,344550,in a MacBook makes this a non-issue
k8RkyaSHFLM,344550,347637,but on a stationary machine plugged into wall power
k8RkyaSHFLM,347637,350120,Well make sure that you combine
k8RkyaSHFLM,350120,352580,the Mac studio with a battery backup.
k8RkyaSHFLM,352580,354840,That'll add to the already high price tag
k8RkyaSHFLM,354840,356280,for the M1 ultra variant
k8RkyaSHFLM,356280,357577,but if you take Apple at their word
k8RkyaSHFLM,357577,359550,it's the most powerful machine
k8RkyaSHFLM,359550,360746,you can buy for the money.
k8RkyaSHFLM,360746,362040,Get subscribed
k8RkyaSHFLM,362040,366710,because we are definitely putting that claim to the test.
k8RkyaSHFLM,366710,368759,You might also want to combine the Mac studio
k8RkyaSHFLM,368760,370570,with a new studio display.
k8RkyaSHFLM,370570,372410,Apple certainly wants you to
k8RkyaSHFLM,372410,374900,the panel itself seems suspiciously similar
k8RkyaSHFLM,374900,377160,to the existing LG UltraFine 5K
k8RkyaSHFLM,377160,378810,with a slight bump and peak brightness
k8RkyaSHFLM,378810,381520,and 10 gig type C ports instead of 5 gig.
k8RkyaSHFLM,381520,383840,It even has similar power delivery capabilities
k8RkyaSHFLM,383840,384680,to the recent models
k8RkyaSHFLM,384680,387126,so it seems like a bit of a cop out
k8RkyaSHFLM,387127,389530,until you get under the hood.
k8RkyaSHFLM,389530,392160,Ye from lttstore.com.
k8RkyaSHFLM,392160,393410,Got it in there
k8RkyaSHFLM,393410,395330,what makes the studio display special
k8RkyaSHFLM,395330,397740,aside from the aluminum and glass construction
k8RkyaSHFLM,397740,399370,is the A13 bionic chip
k8RkyaSHFLM,399370,402000,powering a plethora of onboard goodies.
k8RkyaSHFLM,402000,404490,It's got a very similar speaker array on paper
k8RkyaSHFLM,404490,406240,to the 24 inch M1 iMac
k8RkyaSHFLM,406240,407970,complete with special audio
k8RkyaSHFLM,407970,410490,a three-mic array presumably with noise suppression
k8RkyaSHFLM,410490,412965,and an integrated 12 megapixel FaceTime camera
k8RkyaSHFLM,412965,415220,capable of center stage
k8RkyaSHFLM,415220,418980,which means you can finally use center stage on a Mac
k8RkyaSHFLM,418980,421474,like the one place it makes a lot of sense
k8RkyaSHFLM,421474,423550,not to mention the A13
k8RkyaSHFLM,423550,425090,provides the image signal processing
k8RkyaSHFLM,425090,427400,we've come to expect from Apple Silicon.
k8RkyaSHFLM,427400,428810,That means that the Mac itself
k8RkyaSHFLM,428810,430360,doesn't need to do any of the work
k8RkyaSHFLM,430360,432729,freeing up the neural engine for other tasks.
k8RkyaSHFLM,432730,434610,It even makes these AI features usable
k8RkyaSHFLM,434610,437120,on Intel max as old as 2016.
k8RkyaSHFLM,437120,438650,Now the studio display XDR
k8RkyaSHFLM,438650,440330,comes with three mounting options
k8RkyaSHFLM,440330,442500,a 30 degree tilt-adjustable stand
k8RkyaSHFLM,442500,444010,a pro display XDR like stand
k8RkyaSHFLM,444010,445543,except without rotation support
k8RkyaSHFLM,445543,447980,and an ugly VESA mount
k8RkyaSHFLM,447980,449310,although it looks like
k8RkyaSHFLM,449310,451417,you need to choose what you want out of the factory
k8RkyaSHFLM,451417,453695,because unlike the pro display XDR
k8RkyaSHFLM,453696,456480,there isn't a user accessible mounting mechanism
k8RkyaSHFLM,456480,458096,on the display itself.
k8RkyaSHFLM,458096,460290,Thankfully the VESA mount
k8RkyaSHFLM,460290,462024,and tilt adjustable stand are options
k8RkyaSHFLM,462024,465409,that don't add to the already lofty 1599 price tag
k8RkyaSHFLM,465410,467729,but the tilt and height adjustable stand
k8RkyaSHFLM,467729,469753,costs an extra 400 bucks
k8RkyaSHFLM,469753,473110,I guess rotation is a $600 value now
k8RkyaSHFLM,473110,474009,it's worth mentioning
k8RkyaSHFLM,474010,476848,that the UltraFine 5K is $300 cheaper
k8RkyaSHFLM,476848,478990,and it's already priced $300 higher
k8RkyaSHFLM,478990,480759,than the old Thunderbolt displays were
k8RkyaSHFLM,480760,482040,I can't win 'em all I guess
k8RkyaSHFLM,482040,484060,but hey you've got the option
k8RkyaSHFLM,484060,486500,of buying color matched silver and black peripherals.
k8RkyaSHFLM,486500,489120,So it's not all bad
k8RkyaSHFLM,489120,490139,whatever
k8RkyaSHFLM,490140,491922,the rest of the event was pretty unimpressive
k8RkyaSHFLM,491922,494570,we got a spec bump for the iPad air
k8RkyaSHFLM,494570,497210,now powered by the M1 SOC with 8 gigs of Ram
k8RkyaSHFLM,497210,501272,and rocking a 12 megapixel front camera with central stage.
k8RkyaSHFLM,501272,504434,It's got 5G support now and it comes in new colors.
k8RkyaSHFLM,504434,506750,I don't really know what else to say here
k8RkyaSHFLM,506750,508880,they're comparing it to a similarly priced laptop
k8RkyaSHFLM,508880,511690,and while I don't disagree that for a layperson
k8RkyaSHFLM,511690,513260,it's probably a better experience
k8RkyaSHFLM,513260,515200,it's really not the same thing unless
k8RkyaSHFLM,515200,518479,and until they bring Mac OS to the iPad
k8RkyaSHFLM,518479,520555,which they stubbornly refuse to do
k8RkyaSHFLM,520555,521388,the other specs
k8RkyaSHFLM,521388,523797,as much as they talked about them are the same
k8RkyaSHFLM,523797,525710,with the exception of the type C port
k8RkyaSHFLM,525710,528540,which is now 10 gigabits per second rather than 5.
k8RkyaSHFLM,528540,530970,It's a little less disappointing than the iPhone SE
k8RkyaSHFLM,530970,533439,and I know that's going to be a hot take
k8RkyaSHFLM,533440,534860,but hear me out
k8RkyaSHFLM,534860,536170,the price is going up
k8RkyaSHFLM,536170,538149,and all we're getting is the A 15 bionic SOC
k8RkyaSHFLM,538150,540435,a few hours better battery life
k8RkyaSHFLM,540435,543210,ceramic shield and 5G.
k8RkyaSHFLM,543210,545120,The rest is exactly the same
k8RkyaSHFLM,545120,546990,right down to the iPhone eight and star chassis.
k8RkyaSHFLM,546990,548620,Now to be clear
k8RkyaSHFLM,548620,551950,I wasn't expecting Apple to reinvent the wheel here.
k8RkyaSHFLM,551950,553968,I understand that things are getting more expensive
k8RkyaSHFLM,553968,556813,and glad this form factor is still available
k8RkyaSHFLM,556813,559769,but it would've been nice to see MagSafe
k8RkyaSHFLM,559770,561180,come to the SE
k8RkyaSHFLM,561180,562450,by Apple's own admission
k8RkyaSHFLM,562450,565320,this is going to be many people's first foray into iPhone
k8RkyaSHFLM,565320,568680,and MagSafe is becoming a big part of the ecosystem
k8RkyaSHFLM,568680,570620,I might be giving Apple a harder time over this
k8RkyaSHFLM,570620,574000,than I should be but I I feel it's a missed opportunity
k8RkyaSHFLM,574000,576100,particularly given how long SE models
k8RkyaSHFLM,576100,577889,have traditionally stayed in market.
k8RkyaSHFLM,577890,580890,And that is basically all they talked about
k8RkyaSHFLM,580890,582860,outside of baseball and apple TV plus
k8RkyaSHFLM,582860,587209,and a new green color option for the iPhone 13 and 13 pro.
k8RkyaSHFLM,587210,589304,There are a few things we did pick up on though.
k8RkyaSHFLM,589304,591790,"First, they came out and said"
k8RkyaSHFLM,591790,592880,that the Mac studio
k8RkyaSHFLM,592880,596060,is not the Apple Silicon refreshed the Mac Pro
k8RkyaSHFLM,596060,598003,so that's still on the horizon.
k8RkyaSHFLM,598003,600761,"Second, they said that the Mac pro"
k8RkyaSHFLM,600762,604211,was the final Mac to make the transition
k8RkyaSHFLM,604211,607880,and the 27 inch iMac like the iMac pro
k8RkyaSHFLM,607880,610581,is now missing from Apple's product pages.
k8RkyaSHFLM,610581,613440,In fact if you type 27 into the URL bar
k8RkyaSHFLM,613440,614840,to try and force it you're redirected
k8RkyaSHFLM,614840,616722,to the 24 inch pages set
k8RkyaSHFLM,616722,619331,My guess is the M1 max iMac studio
k8RkyaSHFLM,619331,622220,is taking the place of the 27 inch
k8RkyaSHFLM,622220,623379,which makes sense
k8RkyaSHFLM,623380,625380,looking at the performance comparisons I get it
k8RkyaSHFLM,625380,626890,just feels
k8RkyaSHFLM,626890,628630,strange for apple to discontinue
k8RkyaSHFLM,628630,630730,a long standing skew like that
k8RkyaSHFLM,630730,633040,with no fanfare you know
k8RkyaSHFLM,633040,635099,speaking of bailing with no fanfare
k8RkyaSHFLM,635099,637260,we'll have all this stuff linked below
k8RkyaSHFLM,637260,639480,and we are gonna be clicking on those links ourselves
k8RkyaSHFLM,639480,641102,cause we've got a lot of apple hardware to purchase.
k8RkyaSHFLM,641103,644000,So
k8RkyaSHFLM,644000,644840,I'd better get cracking
