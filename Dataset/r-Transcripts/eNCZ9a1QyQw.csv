eNCZ9a1QyQw,759090,761440,It's a craft I made.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,761440,763840,Do you know what instrument it's supposed to be?
eNCZ9a1QyQw,765160,766720,"A guitar, yeah."

eNCZ9a1QyQw,769370,772910,I'll show you how you can make one like this at home.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,772910,774683,Let's gather the things we need.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,776200,778390,Some things we need for this craft are:
eNCZ9a1QyQw,778390,780213,"A long cardboard tube,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,782640,784193,"elastic bands,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,786930,788493,a tissue box.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,789820,791440,and a grownup.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,791440,795880,The tissue box is going to be the body of our guitar.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,795880,799270,The hole in the box is a lot like the holes that we see
eNCZ9a1QyQw,799270,800270,in a lot of guitars.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,801250,804497,"The cardboard tube is going to be the neck of our guitar,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,804497,808370,and you can paint them both any color you like.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,808370,812160,"I painted my tissue box my favorite color, blue,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,812160,814540,it's dry and all ready to go.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,814540,819540,We'll attach our cardboard tube by tracing the end of it
eNCZ9a1QyQw,819820,823300,onto one side of the cardboard box.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,823300,827140,Then a grownup can help you carefully cut that out
eNCZ9a1QyQw,827140,828560,like this.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,828560,830650,And we're gonna put the cardboard tube inside.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,830650,832800,And it doesn't have to be perfect
eNCZ9a1QyQw,832800,835170,"because once the cardboard tube goes in,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,835170,837130,"if it's a little bit smaller,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,837130,841220,"it'll stay nice and snug in place, there."
eNCZ9a1QyQw,841220,844920,Now our guitar is ready for our strings.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,844920,849820,"We're gonna use elastic bands, I have some orange ones here."
eNCZ9a1QyQw,849820,853180,"We're gonna add four elastic bands,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,853180,858162,two on the top of the cardboard tube and two on the bottom.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,859270,862530,"My guitar in the classroom has six strings,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,862530,864943,"but this is a crafty guitar, so it has four."
eNCZ9a1QyQw,866440,869170,Different elastic bands will make different sounds.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,869170,872329,You might like to experiment using thin ones
eNCZ9a1QyQw,872330,875177,"or thicker ones, smaller ones or bigger ones"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,875177,877377,and see what sound you like for your guitar.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,880130,882610,"To make our guitar sound a little bit better,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,882610,885750,we're gonna add in some popsicle sticks.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,885750,889550,We can glue two regular popsicle sticks
eNCZ9a1QyQw,889550,894350,"on top of each other just to make it a little bit thicker,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,894350,895899,here we go.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,895900,900630,And we'll carefully stick them underneath the elastic bands
eNCZ9a1QyQw,900630,902420,and just push them to one side.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,902420,905933,"I have another one here, push it to the other side,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,907680,910279,and that'll help make it sound a little bit better.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,910280,914000,Now our guitar is all ready to decorate.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,914000,916480,"You can decorate yours any way you like,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,916480,920683,"maybe with some stickers, maybe a smiley face sticker."
eNCZ9a1QyQw,922380,923213,Look at that.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,924240,928063,"And once it's all decorated, it might look like this."
eNCZ9a1QyQw,929560,933940,"I added in some pom poms for the knobs on the neck,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,933940,936430,"lots of different stickers and jewels,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,936430,940930,"and even some double-sided tape on the neck of the guitar,"
eNCZ9a1QyQw,940930,945279,just wrapped it around so it looks like a real guitar neck.
eNCZ9a1QyQw,945280,946113,Look at that.
