_Z5UMH8trWE,8240,14000,pretty cool friday  welcome to nigeria before we enter legos
_Z5UMH8trWE,14000,22000,africa's biggest city of over 20 million  we're heading deep into the countryside  to explore nigeria's most unique protein
_Z5UMH8trWE,22000,29199,bush meat  wild african animals that are hunted or  more commonly trapped for the purpose of
_Z5UMH8trWE,29199,33760,consumption have you ever eaten these no  i haven't
_Z5UMH8trWE,35120,41040,bush meat is fairly common here but not  all bush meat is the same this  particular honeymoon is high in
_Z5UMH8trWE,41040,47120,toothpaste i think all meat is high in  protein well this particular one is very  high in protein super protein
_Z5UMH8trWE,47120,55440,in our first two nigeria episodes miss  nigeria and i are taking on this  distinct delicacy we're doing it
_Z5UMH8trWE,55440,61359,from clean and orderly bush meat farms  to markets hawking wild animals some
_Z5UMH8trWE,61359,67680,that i never expected to see  for sale  but before that
_Z5UMH8trWE,67680,73760,i'm heading to a small local village to  see what folks here cook up as part of  their everyday diet
_Z5UMH8trWE,73760,78799,breakfast is here by the way thank you  esther and her family settled here by
_Z5UMH8trWE,78799,85360,the river a few hours from the mega city  of lagos folks around here make most of  their income through fishing and farming
_Z5UMH8trWE,85360,91840,but selling fish traps is another common  side hustle esther has a third business  that brings in neighbors and brought us
_Z5UMH8trWE,91840,96880,here too it looks stunning and it's a  large volume of food that's about the  size of my stomach they say your stomach
_Z5UMH8trWE,96880,102399,is about the size of your fist you know  that no right too that's your stomach i  think my stomach is smaller this is even
_Z5UMH8trWE,102399,109040,more than your stomach could you eat  this whole thing i don't think so let's  see  made from corn that's been fermented for
_Z5UMH8trWE,109040,116799,three days pop is a good source of  calories and nutrition prep is simple  boil it in water and mix mix mix
_Z5UMH8trWE,116799,122960,but pop alone is bland folks usually  combine it with something else first of  all have to add the sugar to the pop
_Z5UMH8trWE,122960,129679,ruth my local guide shows me how to  double down on the flavor  this oh you get deep yeah how are you
_Z5UMH8trWE,129679,135599,going oh see that real deep  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,135599,141280,wow  or a side meal made of beans and red  chili peppers
_Z5UMH8trWE,141280,147360,holy [ __ ] no i can do it no sit down sit  down take a break  then deep fried until it turns a
_Z5UMH8trWE,147360,153360,beautifully crispy shade of golden brown  they call it akura  akara ah
_Z5UMH8trWE,153360,159280,yeah it's nice if you eat it together  these are simple affordable ingredients  but when prepared the right way with a
_Z5UMH8trWE,159280,166050,bit of work and creativity it's  delicious a little more pop  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,167120,172400,that's the combination i like it it kind  of coats your mouth it's so smooth a  little bit sweet from the sugar almost
_Z5UMH8trWE,172400,177519,sour they're both good i love these  fritters super crunchy just a little bit  of seasoning not overpowering pop and
_Z5UMH8trWE,177519,185599,bean cakes are breakfast staples but in  the end they are just cleverly disguised  vegetables so what about the meat
_Z5UMH8trWE,185599,190879,well today is a special day this is the  first process of the goat preparation
_Z5UMH8trWE,190879,197440,they kind of singed their hairs off this  is a method i've seen done everywhere in  papua when they did a pig in vietnam
_Z5UMH8trWE,197440,203840,when they do goat in nin bin they do the  same thing  next chopped pieces of goat meat are
_Z5UMH8trWE,203840,211920,boiled in a soup made with plantains red  chili peppers and lemongrass the dish is  called goat pepper soup a recipe anyone

_Z5UMH8trWE,1252150,1258400,[Music]  what constitutes exotic meat around the  world isn't exactly clear
_Z5UMH8trWE,1258400,1264159,most would say anything outside commonly  farm-raised chicken pork mutton or beef
_Z5UMH8trWE,1264159,1269360,but here they also farm-raised critters  you'd never find on a new york dinner  menu
_Z5UMH8trWE,1269360,1275600,so what about wild game  is that what makes something exotic some  people eating this one down to the grass
_Z5UMH8trWE,1275600,1281039,hotel which one do you think tastes  better  what is the most expensive bush meat
_Z5UMH8trWE,1281039,1287480,that gets sold here  that antelope is very absolutely
_Z5UMH8trWE,1293440,1299679,personally i grew up in minnesota eating  deer meat that had been hunted and never  thought anything of it
_Z5UMH8trWE,1299679,1305600,in bali some tribes have religious  ceremonies surrounding the slaughter and  consumption of porcupine occupying
_Z5UMH8trWE,1305600,1312000,actually very special for our religion  we offer them to our god in parts of
_Z5UMH8trWE,1312000,1318720,indonesia they don't have a history of  agriculture so they hunt and eat wild  boar and rats which one is your favorite
_Z5UMH8trWE,1318720,1324640,huh i think was he like rats alright i'm  starting to feel better about rats so  what is exotic and what's just another
_Z5UMH8trWE,1324640,1331600,day in nigeria's countryside this is the  auction area for all these animals all  this bushmeat she's got a giant monitor
_Z5UMH8trWE,1331600,1337919,lizard here oh geez  so this is generally kind of what's  available here i mean what is on this
_Z5UMH8trWE,1337919,1343840,table so there's uh is that a this is  a deer yeah yes these are antelope yeah
_Z5UMH8trWE,1343840,1349840,are these babies or do they only get  that big this big one oh that's the big  one it's full size there's nothing here
_Z5UMH8trWE,1349840,1356080,that be on your typical costco grocery  list and what's this one  bush cat
_Z5UMH8trWE,1356080,1361600,for the price of about five cups of  starbucks coffee you can pick up  something like this and then there's
_Z5UMH8trWE,1361600,1368400,this one  a bush dog dog yes so this is some kind  of a wild dog yes this one is
_Z5UMH8trWE,1368400,1374720,you can't come outside okay so it's not  a pet yes oh  that's a crocodile so this one's a live
_Z5UMH8trWE,1374720,1381120,stone  where'd you get it  beside the bush just like in some water
_Z5UMH8trWE,1381120,1387679,wow  this is something else  the surreal range of available creatures
_Z5UMH8trWE,1387679,1393840,is a shock even to me  creatures i'd only seen on animal planet
_Z5UMH8trWE,1393840,1398960,are right here in front of me ready for  sale to the highest bidder
_Z5UMH8trWE,1398960,1404720,my understanding is you know in nigeria  you can still get chicken goat sheep cow
_Z5UMH8trWE,1404720,1410159,all of that you can get pretty easily  even though the bush meat is more  expensive people want to buy it why is
_Z5UMH8trWE,1410159,1415360,that  the taste is very different  is it just the taste or is it also like
_Z5UMH8trWE,1415360,1421919,are there any health benefits or  something medicinal about the food it  would buy bushmill
_Z5UMH8trWE,1421919,1427760,because it's not common are there any  animals that are restricted by the  government are there any animals that
_Z5UMH8trWE,1427760,1434080,are off limits  nearly all the animals here today are
_Z5UMH8trWE,1434080,1440080,not endangered  regardless i find it interesting that  from what i can see the idea of
_Z5UMH8trWE,1440080,1445200,endangered isn't really a concept here  with no oversight or government
_Z5UMH8trWE,1445200,1451840,regulation  every day hunters and trappers go to the  seemingly infinite jungle and every day
_Z5UMH8trWE,1451840,1459039,they bring back something to sell  this has been happening for generations  for them it was normal then
_Z5UMH8trWE,1459039,1462840,and it's normal now
_Z5UMH8trWE,1471570,1474700,[Music]

_Z5UMH8trWE,1520240,1527760,the meat is put in a well-known local  mixture of palm oil onion a blend of  chili peppers tomato and onion
_Z5UMH8trWE,1527760,1534230,it appears the lizard boils for some  time to cook it through and soften up  the meat
_Z5UMH8trWE,1534230,1539760,[Music]  so we've been invited for a local treat
_Z5UMH8trWE,1539760,1546480,you've cooked up some uh lizard right  yeah money totally is that let's try it  out joining our meal deremy a local
_Z5UMH8trWE,1546480,1552559,producer who's been assisting our  production in nigeria also for those  still wondering the monitor lizard is
_Z5UMH8trWE,1552559,1557840,not an endangered species this is a  local preparation yes so is that a  preparation you could do with any kind
_Z5UMH8trWE,1557840,1563760,of meat yeah so any kind of meat  someone's falling from this market they  might cook it this way yes but here  we're going to eat it with our
_Z5UMH8trWE,1563760,1569679,traditional meal  which is called eba  this is ebba a staple food in nigeria
_Z5UMH8trWE,1569679,1576240,it's made of dry grated cassava that's  been mixed with hot water all right this  is our carbohydrate oh it's so hot i'm

_Z5UMH8trWE,1583200,1588880,the sauce was really good fresh spicy  and just tomatoey
_Z5UMH8trWE,1588880,1594559,descriptions  this meat's still pretty hot i didn't  dig into that yet where do you think  they caught this lizard from the other
_Z5UMH8trWE,1594559,1599760,side of the lake you think they set up  traps over there yeah they do okay so  some people are real hunters yeah
_Z5UMH8trWE,1599760,1606080,probably mostly it's trappers definitely  have to be a hunter to be able to know  how to set to the trap
_Z5UMH8trWE,1606080,1611760,and know when to check up if the trap  has gotten any game or meets passing  right if you leave something in the trap
_Z5UMH8trWE,1611760,1617360,too long then something else gets your  meal thank you yeah  what pieces is this what i even get are
_Z5UMH8trWE,1617360,1622880,these ribs can i just bite off them yeah  yeah you could you could ah there you go  there you go it doesn't look that hard
_Z5UMH8trWE,1622880,1630400,to bite into the skin feels a little bit  like that snake from before it's thick  and kind of gelatinous gooey yeah get in
_Z5UMH8trWE,1630400,1637200,there  that's pretty good oh
_Z5UMH8trWE,1638240,1644880,that's pretty good it's so spicy man  that spice just hangs out in the back of  my throat yeah but that's how we like
_Z5UMH8trWE,1644880,1650399,our sauce and this part of nigeria but i  love the flavor and it's addictive like  you got to satisfy that spice by adding
_Z5UMH8trWE,1650399,1655710,more spice yeah  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,1656399,1661520,some of these animals deep in the forest  they might have diseases i know it's  probably not the most fun topic while
_Z5UMH8trWE,1661520,1668799,we're eating one of them is that  something people worry about here or  they feel like they've been fine they've  been healthy no problem
_Z5UMH8trWE,1668799,1675679,it's well known now more than ever that  viral outbreaks can originate from  bushmeat species especially bats
_Z5UMH8trWE,1675679,1680960,pangolins and several primates  regardless of if the animals in the
_Z5UMH8trWE,1680960,1686159,bushmeat the game has  an illness or not  and we believe that the enzymes the
_Z5UMH8trWE,1686159,1692960,germs the virus will not be able to  stand  the heat level or the temperature level  at which we cook them some of the spices
_Z5UMH8trWE,1692960,1699440,we use in africa are medicinal  so we believe that some of those spices  cure the sickness
_Z5UMH8trWE,1699440,1705600,the problem with bush meat is outbreaks  don't happen most of the time they don't  even happen some of the time which can
_Z5UMH8trWE,1705600,1711120,lull folks into a false sense of  security  an inter-species elite by a virus is
_Z5UMH8trWE,1711120,1717559,incredibly rare but when it happens the  results can be catastrophic
_Z5UMH8trWE,1725630,1732720,[Music]  have you guys ever gotten sick from some
_Z5UMH8trWE,1732720,1738720,meat no i've not nobody eats rare meat  here right nah even beef no do you eat  rare beef no we don't throughout africa
_Z5UMH8trWE,1738720,1744990,that's a common thing well except for  when i went to kenya i did have a raw  blood and raw kidney from a goat
_Z5UMH8trWE,1744990,1758079,[Music]  in kenya did you eat it  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,1759600,1766480,this is what i love about traveling the  world is like you're talking to me about  yeah there's people down here who eat  monkeys once in a while and i'm like
_Z5UMH8trWE,1766480,1771760,yeah across africa they're eating the  raw kidney from a goat in your life
_Z5UMH8trWE,1771760,1776799,dude  have some limits let's respect the  boundaries

_Z5UMH8trWE,1787070,1792880,[Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,1792880,1799840,i don't want to persuade you that what  happens here is good or bad i just want  you to understand why
_Z5UMH8trWE,1799840,1805200,here and in many parts of africa it's  been like this since anyone can remember
_Z5UMH8trWE,1805200,1811760,like it or not the bushmeat industry is  going to continue until its financial  incentives are taken away
_Z5UMH8trWE,1811760,1818360,and until education of its potential  repercussions becomes widespread
_Z5UMH8trWE,1825520,1830960,legos nigeria this is africa's most  populated city densely packed with over
_Z5UMH8trWE,1830960,1837279,20 million people  this city is not for the weak from all  around the country

_Z5UMH8trWE,2075440,2081040,that i love because the fish was fried  earlier kind of heavy so it's nice to  cut it with some vegetables kind of mix

_Z5UMH8trWE,2104960,2110320,is like that i go to japan they don't  like anything spontaneous they're like  you should have planned i need to ask
_Z5UMH8trWE,2110320,2115839,five levels of bosses above me so they  would just not be a fan of it and they'd  politely ask you to stop i did not get
_Z5UMH8trWE,2115839,2122960,kicked out of 711 did you i didn't i  walked out yeah  nigeria they'll ask you to stop but they

_Z5UMH8trWE,2135839,2139280,shooting in legos
_Z5UMH8trWE,2142960,2148480,it's abundant  it's dynamic  it's pure energy

_Z5UMH8trWE,2153599,2159920,very active  everything is so fast here literally  legos one of the fastest growing cities
_Z5UMH8trWE,2159920,2167119,in the world always moving always  changing if you want to survive pick a  spot and sell something

_Z5UMH8trWE,2185359,2190880,are not  the whole reason is  if you can't tip them
_Z5UMH8trWE,2190880,2196720,they're fine  so you should never go anywhere and just  start shooting randomly the moment that
_Z5UMH8trWE,2196720,2202720,you're coming somewhere else you bring  in camera they feel like oh they can  make money out of this then some people
_Z5UMH8trWE,2202720,2208760,will come at you and then that's when  you have to tip them

_Z5UMH8trWE,2326960,2333280,love pepper  the noodles are like kind of mushy i  think because they added the egg inside

_Z5UMH8trWE,2391820,2398720,[Music]  [Applause]
_Z5UMH8trWE,2398720,2405839,shooting in legos is not easy for  foreigners or locals alike  but as an outsider if you try it on your
_Z5UMH8trWE,2405839,2410359,own you won't last two minutes
_Z5UMH8trWE,2411119,2416720,i just think it's fair to point out like  shooting here yeah it's fun it's a  challenge but it's not all sunshine and
_Z5UMH8trWE,2416720,2421760,rainbows and it seems like there are  some unspoken rules that if you're not  from here and you don't know him you
_Z5UMH8trWE,2421760,2427040,could get in a lot of trouble so i  thought you have in your papers that  you're allowed to film but also remember
_Z5UMH8trWE,2427040,2435000,that we also have people who are called  the strict boys or the street guys you  still have to deal with them
_Z5UMH8trWE,2435000,2438219,[Applause]
_Z5UMH8trWE,2440880,2448240,here you gotta play by the rules of the  street it starts with the area boys a  hierarchy of gangs that control turf
_Z5UMH8trWE,2448240,2454800,from neighborhood to neighborhood if you  film without the approval of the area  boys it's not going to end well for you
_Z5UMH8trWE,2454800,2460240,one way or another the area boys always  collect for us because we are nigerians
_Z5UMH8trWE,2460240,2466640,and so we know how to maneuver some of  these things but there are times that  you cannot maneuver it you still have to
_Z5UMH8trWE,2466640,2473520,just tip some people and just so that  you can have peace so it's best to start  out on their good side but even then
_Z5UMH8trWE,2473520,2479960,scuffles and misunderstandings can  happen that's just the way it is
_Z5UMH8trWE,2481200,2486400,boom nice street food it is very loud  here yes i think it might be the
_Z5UMH8trWE,2486400,2492160,generator could you fall asleep to this  wow

_Z5UMH8trWE,2504000,2510400,originating in the north in nigeria we  have different tribes okay but this  particular thing is mostly done by the
_Z5UMH8trWE,2510400,2516800,australia  and this is basically just meat on a  stick yes yeah a spicy meat skewer it
_Z5UMH8trWE,2516800,2522079,can be beef ram chicken or a variety of  organ meats marinated with yaji pepper
_Z5UMH8trWE,2522079,2527920,is that tripe yes oh i had a lot of  tripe on my trip already and i'm not  sure how much stomach i should put in my
_Z5UMH8trWE,2527920,2534560,stomach what's the far one this is giza  if you just only could get two things  and then you die tomorrow
_Z5UMH8trWE,2534560,2540800,well okay how about in this scenario you  don't even have to die at all yeah if  you could choose only two what would  they be
_Z5UMH8trWE,2540800,2546240,and personally i love dessert beef and  dessert yeah let's do it the meat is
_Z5UMH8trWE,2546240,2551280,tossed atop a fiery charcoal wafting  extending a welcoming aroma like some
_Z5UMH8trWE,2551280,2558240,kind of meat scented axe body spray he  chops it into biteable bits and serves  it up with cabbage onion and even more
_Z5UMH8trWE,2558240,2563440,yachty goodness what do you want to try  first soya let's join so what makes this
_Z5UMH8trWE,2563440,2570240,special easy pepe they mix it with  different kind of things and that's what  makes it sweeter
_Z5UMH8trWE,2571200,2577200,oh my god  i peed my pants a little bit  wow it's really crunchy it's kind of
_Z5UMH8trWE,2577200,2582560,tough it's like a hot beef jerky  no do you think it's tender not so
_Z5UMH8trWE,2582560,2587680,strong but it's not as soft as like uh  kobe beef it's not as hard as jerky and
_Z5UMH8trWE,2587680,2595200,somewhere in between but do you like it  sweet spicy  savory so here we have the gizzard same
_Z5UMH8trWE,2595200,2599680,seasoning and this is extra crispy let's  try it out
_Z5UMH8trWE,2603359,2610079,it's like chicken  jerky it's tough it requires some  chewing but listen i don't mind texture
_Z5UMH8trWE,2610079,2615520,i'm not a guy who thinks every steak  should melt in my mouth and i could eat  it with no teeth i like textures from
_Z5UMH8trWE,2615520,2621520,life tough to gelatinous to gooey to  whatever this is more on the side where  you really have to put some work into
_Z5UMH8trWE,2621520,2627520,chewing to get through it it's a fun  snack so spicy that's the idea the more  you eat the soya you drink more i knew
_Z5UMH8trWE,2627520,2634319,it it's like a bit over salted and you  want to like wash down a cold beer oh  that would be nice huh right guys but i

_Z5UMH8trWE,3333760,3338880,you're big in other parts of the country  you have to struggle and come to lagos  and start from the bottom from the
_Z5UMH8trWE,3338880,3345520,bottom  [Music]  the heartbeat of legos can be felt  throughout the country and throughout
_Z5UMH8trWE,3345520,3352880,the continent  one of the fastest growing cities in the  world  its pulse invites those who are hungry
_Z5UMH8trWE,3352880,3358799,for more  for both of you i want to know what is  your version of success a few years from
_Z5UMH8trWE,3358799,3364880,now what would success look like to you  and here in lagos okay  success is not all about money
_Z5UMH8trWE,3364880,3370480,success to me is all about getting  better in your craft and trying to be  better in what you do so that when you
_Z5UMH8trWE,3370480,3376079,are no longer there people will have a  reason  to talk about you or to look out for
_Z5UMH8trWE,3376079,3381520,your craft or to check out your old  stuff and all that so for me success is  all about how many lives are impacted
_Z5UMH8trWE,3381520,3387280,while i'm still here  what about you all right similar to what  he said but
_Z5UMH8trWE,3387280,3393680,what would really give me great joy and  fulfillment is when i know that i have  the influence to change some things or
_Z5UMH8trWE,3393680,3400880,you know change people's life or make  their life better with what i do and at  the same time it comes with money i
_Z5UMH8trWE,3400880,3405980,think there's nothing wrong with saying  that you can do a lot more good with  money than without money so
_Z5UMH8trWE,3405980,3413119,[Music]  in the end these streets will make or  break you but either way you'll never
_Z5UMH8trWE,3413119,3419599,know  until you try for me coming to legos  being here for a week like it is a true
_Z5UMH8trWE,3419599,3424720,test and it's been a challenge worth  taking on i feel like really fulfilled
_Z5UMH8trWE,3424720,3430559,like each day i feel beat up but i come  back the next day like all right let's  go again [ __ ]
_Z5UMH8trWE,3430559,3436559,when you first came to legos did you  have any culture shock there's one thing  they say if you know why it's for  lagrange you're not previously anywhere
_Z5UMH8trWE,3436559,3443920,else unlike other parts of nigeria life  in lagos is pretty expensive  so the ranks the transportation lagos is
_Z5UMH8trWE,3443920,3449359,not a place that you just come and sleep  on your bed morning till night and  expect mana to fall from heaven
_Z5UMH8trWE,3449359,3455520,man i don't fall from heavenly labor  yeah people here hustle they work their  ass off  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,3455520,3462240,legos has rough edges for an outsider  like me it's a lot to get used to in a  short amount of time what i didn't
_Z5UMH8trWE,3462240,3468240,understand at first is that the  challenges we faced shooting here are a  reflection of a culture who after
_Z5UMH8trWE,3468240,3474799,generations of mistreatment and  oppression from outside forces now  refuses to be taken for granted from
_Z5UMH8trWE,3474799,3482240,outsiders or anyone else  boom that is street food here in legos
_Z5UMH8trWE,3482240,3487280,when we started this video i put forth  the 100 challenge in this city to see if
_Z5UMH8trWE,3487280,3494079,i could eat a hundred dollars worth of  street food we have the calculator right  here  it's doing calculations i presume oh we
_Z5UMH8trWE,3494079,3499520,didn't okay the editor did not put and  the final number is

_Z5UMH8trWE,3840799,3847039,makoka was not planned but born of human  necessity  this place started as a fishing village
_Z5UMH8trWE,3847039,3853838,settled in the 19th century wow what is  he making that looks awesome hello look  at this
_Z5UMH8trWE,3853920,3859280,wow  now it's home to more than 200 000  people
_Z5UMH8trWE,3859280,3865920,most of the structures here rest on  stilts above the lagos lagoon  it's a spectacle that can't be missed as
_Z5UMH8trWE,3865920,3869920,you cross the nearby mainland bridge
_Z5UMH8trWE,3871280,3876960,i've been here for just a couple hours  today so far no doubt there is struggle  here but as i look around as i look in

_Z5UMH8trWE,3890480,3896000,finding a way to make it work  as far as i can see
_Z5UMH8trWE,3896000,3903920,life in macoco is tough  but that sentiment isn't reflected on  the faces of its inhabitants
_Z5UMH8trWE,3904160,3910160,to get a better understanding of how  this place works we've been given the  opportunity to meet the man of makoko
_Z5UMH8trWE,3910160,3916640,village first of all before we get into  the interview this is probably the most  terrifying place i've ever done an  interview really yeah well i'm at the
_Z5UMH8trWE,3916640,3922559,edge of um  here there might be some structural  issues in this general area but i think
_Z5UMH8trWE,3922559,3927839,i'll be okay  i won't push you taiwu thank you for  joining us yeah thanks for coming have
_Z5UMH8trWE,3927839,3934559,you grown up here yes i was born here on  whatsapp taiwo's father was named chief  after taiwo's grandfather passed away at
_Z5UMH8trWE,3934559,3940400,the age of 115. soon he himself will be  expected to take on this responsibility
_Z5UMH8trWE,3940400,3946480,how deep is the water here it's five  feet i'll be okay yeah so if you fall in  you still you're gonna be this far over
_Z5UMH8trWE,3946480,3952160,if you fall in just stand up  are people using this water for anything  you know this water yeah we don't use it
_Z5UMH8trWE,3952160,3957359,for anything we have a boho where we get  our drinking water from the other time  we use the water is when it's raining
_Z5UMH8trWE,3957359,3964640,season the kids jump into the water to  learn how to swim  that's pretty important here i think huh  do you know how to swim yes i do
_Z5UMH8trWE,3964640,3972720,nice  since you were born you've been here in  this village growing up how has this  place changed since you were a kid

_Z5UMH8trWE,3979359,3984799,dabbing salon the hair stylist but the  changes i can ever see so far is
_Z5UMH8trWE,3984799,3991359,the kids going to school because before  we we don't go to school  living our water is part of our culture
_Z5UMH8trWE,3991359,3999119,everybody based on fishy  when your dad is going after fishing you  go with your dad you learn how to fish
_Z5UMH8trWE,4000079,4006880,fishing is a primary means of livelihood  for the macoco community  this single industry drives the economy
_Z5UMH8trWE,4006880,4014079,here so it's an essential generational  skill for nearly everyone  the women work the market the men work
_Z5UMH8trWE,4014079,4021799,the boats cruising into the ocean  dropping their nets and bringing back  something to sell
_Z5UMH8trWE,4024160,4029599,have you done shooting like this before  not silly not really what's harder  fishing or shooting yeah fishing
_Z5UMH8trWE,4029599,4035680,fishing's harder yeah okay that seems  obvious  how old were you the first time you came  out here and learned how to fish when i
_Z5UMH8trWE,4035680,4042319,was in your five years i started going  with my dad to learn how to fish  yeah when i got to the age of 12 yes
_Z5UMH8trWE,4042319,4048240,sometime i go with my friends  when i got married my father had to tell  me to go on my own so that whatever
_Z5UMH8trWE,4048240,4053680,money i make it has to be me and my wife  ah okay in a good day how much fish is a
_Z5UMH8trWE,4053680,4060640,fisherman bringing in when it's raining  season we make much money but right now  if you go in this time you make like ten
_Z5UMH8trWE,4060640,4069039,thousand seven thousand sometimes five  thousand like 20 bucks a day yeah  because we have a lot of people  insufficient now lots of them
_Z5UMH8trWE,4069359,4075280,in this process i can say the women make  much money than the men so we just have  to come back with the fees to give the
_Z5UMH8trWE,4075280,4081760,fish to them so they take it in the  markets if the price change they know  that's in the market we don't know about  it so when we come back we scale the
_Z5UMH8trWE,4081760,4087359,basket for them two thousand so they pay  us our money two thousand so they can go  outside and sell it ten thousand five
_Z5UMH8trWE,4087359,4093200,thousand that's not a problem so the men  work the boats and the women work the  markets yes
_Z5UMH8trWE,4094710,4099738,[Music]

_Z5UMH8trWE,4319840,4326080,to take us away from here because they  said makoku is the center of lagos  and most of the rich people want to stay
_Z5UMH8trWE,4326080,4332320,here that if any visitors come to  nigeria you must surely want to visit  lagos so once they drive to that
_Z5UMH8trWE,4332320,4337840,malamute they see makoku as an iso  that's why the government is fighting

_Z5UMH8trWE,4510480,4516960,is let's say education  that'll be the best  i think once they start going to school
_Z5UMH8trWE,4516960,4523120,they stand they start learning other  traits from outside they start learning  other work to do some of them can just
_Z5UMH8trWE,4523120,4530640,work outside and live  fishing  but do you think kids are getting  educated by staying here or is the goal
_Z5UMH8trWE,4530640,4536080,to get educated so they can move out and  do something else once they get  education if they are educated no none
_Z5UMH8trWE,4536080,4543800,of them want to stay here they want to  get a better place to live than here and  that's okay with you
_Z5UMH8trWE,4553280,4559040,the people watching this video is there  anything they can do to help i think the  first thing is
_Z5UMH8trWE,4559040,4564960,they should support the community with  uh with a boot that we can use and clean
_Z5UMH8trWE,4564960,4570960,cleaning of the community  we need to get people working just like  before we do it every month but there
_Z5UMH8trWE,4570960,4577360,are big commands outside one is when  they open them so they floss into our  community so we've written a letter to
_Z5UMH8trWE,4577360,4584239,them they just stop doing that that's  why the opening is dirty the oily murky  water and trash didn't come from these
_Z5UMH8trWE,4584239,4590239,residents it's the result of city water  drainage pouring directly into this  neighborhood barack obama and the
_Z5UMH8trWE,4590239,4596000,president they said the money was sent  to mako to develop the whole community  we said we didn't see it
_Z5UMH8trWE,4596000,4603120,so when they got to the council they  said they don't know about the money  so  right now strangers come they want to
_Z5UMH8trWE,4603120,4608640,help the community what we do is that we  tell them to come directly not to go  through the government right god wants
_Z5UMH8trWE,4608640,4615520,to go through them they will tell them  to submit the money once they give them  the money  it disappears yeah yeah not so good
_Z5UMH8trWE,4615520,4622800,like many issues in lagos or around the  world the solution seems simple until  you dig a little deeper and discover a
_Z5UMH8trWE,4622800,4629520,web of complexity that'll likely leave  you feeling helpless  but change starts with hope and it's
_Z5UMH8trWE,4629520,4633480,fueled by actions
_Z5UMH8trWE,4660800,4666800,this is uh  probably the coolest most remote  unusual bar i've ever been to in my life
_Z5UMH8trWE,4666800,4673040,i like the vibe in here right it's a  good vibe so last time you were here  you were actually contributing by doing
_Z5UMH8trWE,4673040,4679199,some art they painted that tiny little  square that's a nice contribution  what kind of deeper look did you get
_Z5UMH8trWE,4679199,4685679,today that you missed when you were here  last time a lot of things that i didn't  fully understand until that now
_Z5UMH8trWE,4685679,4691360,obviously i know now where the dirt is  coming from it's not their waste but  it's the waste that's coming in right
_Z5UMH8trWE,4691360,4697600,it's other people's waste yes is there  something you personally want to do oh  ever since i've come here my plan is to
_Z5UMH8trWE,4697600,4703840,flare up the city i don't want people to  come here and tell them to move because  it's not as clean i want people to come  here and see my cocoa as a part of the
_Z5UMH8trWE,4703840,4710159,good things that our country has might  take time but i hope that i have the  patience and the consistency to keep
_Z5UMH8trWE,4710159,4717600,going as i have since i found it until  now i think it's definitely an enormous  task but absolutely it's a place worth
_Z5UMH8trWE,4717600,4721840,putting resources into  cheers

_Z5UMH8trWE,5360560,5366239,everything it's so complicated i think  that's a great piece of advice though if  you want to start a restaurant at least  take a business course if you don't have
_Z5UMH8trWE,5366239,5372080,that business acumen you don't have that  knowledge of business it's gonna be  really hard except you do get a partner  who is the business person and then

_Z5UMH8trWE,5490159,5496000,your country that you hadn't realized  before i started to appreciate our food  even more because i missed nigerian food
_Z5UMH8trWE,5496000,5501600,i missed the complexity of the flavor i  missed the depth of a lot of the things  that we cooked i also mixed the
_Z5UMH8trWE,5501600,5508719,spiciness  of a lot of our food but i mean i saw a  lot of growth and the space that i was  away lagos in particular had grown
_Z5UMH8trWE,5508719,5514480,tremendously in terms of the amount of  people who had moved in and the number  of new places that had opened and i sort
_Z5UMH8trWE,5514480,5520080,of wanted to join that movement is why i  decided to start the restaurant going  down the restaurant
_Z5UMH8trWE,5520080,5525120,i feel like we really value each other's  presents i mean sometimes people say  that we don't really worry about
_Z5UMH8trWE,5525120,5531520,products but one thing i know for sure  is when i came back here the kind of  protection that i got here and it's
_Z5UMH8trWE,5531520,5536960,different from anywhere else in the  world it might be louder somewhere else  but the way i feel inside is so much it
_Z5UMH8trWE,5536960,5542239,just feels like yeah  yes yeah there's usually  one place that can really make you feel
_Z5UMH8trWE,5542239,5548080,that yeah  [Music]  course two masa a rice cake fried in
_Z5UMH8trWE,5548080,5555280,butter with suya pepper on top paired  with something i've seen in nigeria but  never tried before antelope all we do is
_Z5UMH8trWE,5555280,5560560,toss it in butter rosemary and garlic  that's it we serve the antelope with a
_Z5UMH8trWE,5560560,5566960,antelope reduction and chocolate so it's  chocolate antelope washing
_Z5UMH8trWE,5567520,5573679,so in my head right when an antelope is  killed it's usually like hung to dry out  so this is basically like my
_Z5UMH8trWE,5573679,5578560,interpretation of a hanging antelope or  on a tree
_Z5UMH8trWE,5578800,5583440,and oh cry now are you okay what's  happening
_Z5UMH8trWE,5587520,5592719,you need is get the antelope off the  tree like that coat that in the  chocolate okay
_Z5UMH8trWE,5592719,5600029,let me take a bite  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,5601679,5606800,oh it's so delicious that's nice the  antelope you know it has a little bit of  a organ meat flavor to it like it's
_Z5UMH8trWE,5606800,5612719,almost a little livery it's super lean  too right  and the rice cake to taste a little bit
_Z5UMH8trWE,5612719,5618080,fried with peanut dust or something on  there so good a bit more chocolate
_Z5UMH8trWE,5618080,5623580,do you know what part of me i'm  terrified these are all parts of that  and the bones and that's what you use to  make the chocolate
_Z5UMH8trWE,5623580,5629199,[Music]  okay that weird looking bird that i saw
_Z5UMH8trWE,5629199,5635920,earlier it's right there in this plate  so that bird has been seasoned and
_Z5UMH8trWE,5635920,5644198,salted it's cooked in a sauce called  ayamashi basically like a habanero sauce
_Z5UMH8trWE,5644560,5649760,served with a pounded yam puree finished  up with that sauce the ayamashi and that
_Z5UMH8trWE,5649760,5657520,is the rest of the guinea fowl that put  into a meat grinder it's basically  formed into a croquette
_Z5UMH8trWE,5657600,5664000,enjoy it's really spicy too oh fantastic  we had some pounded yam earlier they  gave us like two kgs of it in a bowl
_Z5UMH8trWE,5664000,5670639,yeah and they were like eat you animals  i like to have this with a  [ __ ] spoon a [ __ ] spoon is that
_Z5UMH8trWE,5670639,5674560,what you said pork and spoon so i use  the spoon
_Z5UMH8trWE,5677280,5683920,that is how you pound a yam  super smooth that's the first thing i  noticed and then oh a strong peppery
_Z5UMH8trWE,5683920,5690480,flavor and that meat there's not that  much fat on it either i would say right  yep but it's not dry or anything it  still like breaks apart and then blends
_Z5UMH8trWE,5690480,5696560,so nicely with the other ingredients  here is there a reason i guess because  it's a tasting menu is that why it's  kind of small yeah it's a tasting menu
_Z5UMH8trWE,5696560,5703840,you're supposed to go through seven  courses and be able to get to the end  right and the ball  [Music]
_Z5UMH8trWE,5703840,5710639,you have a gift to my friend  that's outstanding how do i describe it  it's just good guys just come here and  you eat it and figure it out describe it
_Z5UMH8trWE,5710639,5716159,to yourself and what do you think i  think that this is the only place i want  to eat for the rest of my life it's a
_Z5UMH8trWE,5716159,5718880,whole experience
_Z5UMH8trWE,5723600,5730320,there's no way to sum up lagos or  nigeria whatever bits and pieces of this  culture you bump into during your time
_Z5UMH8trWE,5730320,5737040,here will become your reality one of the  big reasons i wanted to come here is so  far in this series we've shown a lot of
_Z5UMH8trWE,5737040,5742320,food from places like macoco  and oftentimes when i go to countries
_Z5UMH8trWE,5742320,5749440,people feel disappointed that we don't  show like higher end food because it  exists you know whatever people see  becomes a reality and so this is to kind
_Z5UMH8trWE,5749440,5755840,of balance out our coverage of this  place as a filmmaker it's the hardest  yet most rewarding country i've ever
_Z5UMH8trWE,5755840,5761679,visited  i travel to be challenged to immerse  myself in different unfathomable ways of
_Z5UMH8trWE,5761679,5766800,life unlike anything i'm familiar with  but if there is one takeaway that i can
_Z5UMH8trWE,5766800,5774158,hold to be a universal truth it's that  this city  is not for the week
_Z5UMH8trWE,5775760,5781840,even though things are bad here in our  country i'm so confident in our people i  know that we don't [ __ ] be like
_Z5UMH8trWE,5781840,5788000,people are so willing to push through we  have so much  talent it's such a beautiful country
_Z5UMH8trWE,5788000,5794960,it's so colorful it's full of so much  flavor and depth and the people love  each other you know i've never had as
_Z5UMH8trWE,5794960,5801840,much fun as i've had in nigeria  nowhere there's no place ever it's like  a mix of the two of us like i have the
_Z5UMH8trWE,5801840,5807040,worst time and the best time for nigeria  amen
