JpdUwxc6C60,1199,3520,hi guys this is ranjit and this is the
JpdUwxc6C60,3520,6399,jung tech q a session and yes i was not
JpdUwxc6C60,6399,8559,feeling well had a coward that's still
JpdUwxc6C60,8559,10559,recovering but i thought let's do the q
JpdUwxc6C60,10559,12719,a and guys i've taken a little bit less
JpdUwxc6C60,12719,14799,questions generally i take about 25
JpdUwxc6C60,14799,17199,just about half of them but let's get on
JpdUwxc6C60,17199,18240,with this one and this can be
JpdUwxc6C60,18240,19920,interesting because i've taken a variety
JpdUwxc6C60,19920,21840,of questions not just smartphone related
JpdUwxc6C60,21840,24080,uh questions so let's get on with this
JpdUwxc6C60,24080,25279,and the first question i got is the
JpdUwxc6C60,25279,28560,laptop related question he says
JpdUwxc6C60,28560,31279,samsung laptop book 2 uh
JpdUwxc6C60,31279,33760,bro 360 is a good buy my users purely
JpdUwxc6C60,33760,35440,office use constrain the cost is really
JpdUwxc6C60,35440,37120,good buy or is there any other
JpdUwxc6C60,37120,39120,alternative
JpdUwxc6C60,39120,40640,i just want to ask you do you really
JpdUwxc6C60,40640,43440,need that convertible because that 360
JpdUwxc6C60,43440,45840,is the two in one if you don't care
JpdUwxc6C60,45840,48480,about that 360 thing i would say stick
JpdUwxc6C60,48480,50480,to the regular galaxy book 2 or the
JpdUwxc6C60,50480,52160,galaxy book 2 pro if you really want
JpdUwxc6C60,52160,54960,that light weight the galaxy book 2 pro
JpdUwxc6C60,54960,56960,was very good in fact i had both the
JpdUwxc6C60,56960,59039,galaxy booktube 2
JpdUwxc6C60,59039,61840,2 360 pro and the regular galaxy book 2
JpdUwxc6C60,61840,64400,pro and i like the regular uh book 2 pro
JpdUwxc6C60,64400,67040,because how light it was so decide if
JpdUwxc6C60,67040,67920,you
JpdUwxc6C60,67920,69840,are going to use it in the tablet form
JpdUwxc6C60,69840,71680,factor i would say uh both were
JpdUwxc6C60,71680,73119,reviewing it sadly it went back i
JpdUwxc6C60,73119,75439,couldn't do a full review but for what
JpdUwxc6C60,75439,78240,it was that laptop it was a decent one i
JpdUwxc6C60,78240,80159,would say uh considering how light they
JpdUwxc6C60,80159,82240,were for the specs
JpdUwxc6C60,82240,84000,okay uh let's move to the next one this
JpdUwxc6C60,84000,84640,is
JpdUwxc6C60,84640,87040,uh mr chakraborty he says are you still
JpdUwxc6C60,87040,89119,using the s22 ultra how's the overall
JpdUwxc6C60,89119,91119,performance and battery life is battery
JpdUwxc6C60,91119,93360,life as good as the iphone 13 pro i
JpdUwxc6C60,93360,95600,actually never use the s22 ultra as my
JpdUwxc6C60,95600,97920,primary phone only uh when during the
JpdUwxc6C60,97920,100479,initial unboxing area period i used it
JpdUwxc6C60,100479,102799,for three four days and never actually
JpdUwxc6C60,102799,104640,used it as a primary smartphone i always
JpdUwxc6C60,104640,107920,use the samsung galaxy s 22 plus uh so i
JpdUwxc6C60,107920,111119,haven't used it in a daily basis but
JpdUwxc6C60,111119,113360,as far as i remember when i used it in
JpdUwxc6C60,113360,116159,terms of comparison to the iphone 13 pro
JpdUwxc6C60,116159,118159,uh my secondary sim is always on the
JpdUwxc6C60,118159,120399,iphone 13 pro definitely the iphone 13
JpdUwxc6C60,120399,122159,pro gets better battery life compared to
JpdUwxc6C60,122159,125680,the s22 ultra i hope it helps in fact uh
JpdUwxc6C60,125680,127840,if you go with the max iphone 13 pro max
JpdUwxc6C60,127840,129520,that has an insane battery life but even
JpdUwxc6C60,129520,132239,the regular iphone 13 pro the battery
JpdUwxc6C60,132239,134239,life is insane that is one of the big
JpdUwxc6C60,134239,136160,difference i would say from the iphone
JpdUwxc6C60,136160,139200,12 versions to the 13th battery life
JpdUwxc6C60,139200,141760,this is by kunal he's asking what are
JpdUwxc6C60,141760,144080,your thoughts on the samsung 2022 q
JpdUwxc6C60,144080,146800,series sound bars i asked this because
JpdUwxc6C60,146800,148480,no indian tech youtuber has published
JpdUwxc6C60,148480,150400,reviews of the budget q series soundbar
JpdUwxc6C60,150400,153120,like the q 600 700 800. i was interested
JpdUwxc6C60,153120,154640,in buying one of these sandbar but no
JpdUwxc6C60,154640,158160,reviews i can decide uh i actually uh
JpdUwxc6C60,158160,158959,own
JpdUwxc6C60,158959,161519,one of the flagships about two years ago
JpdUwxc6C60,161519,165280,the q 950 t check my channel uh samsung
JpdUwxc6C60,165280,168319,sound bar q 950 that's the highest end
JpdUwxc6C60,168319,170000,uh that time about two two and a half
JpdUwxc6C60,170000,171360,years ago i was debating between the
JpdUwxc6C60,171360,173360,bose sound bar and this one and i found
JpdUwxc6C60,173360,175360,the samsung one to be better for my
JpdUwxc6C60,175360,176800,needs and in fact it worked out to be a
JpdUwxc6C60,176800,178720,lot cheaper than the bose and in fact
JpdUwxc6C60,178720,180959,offered atmos and stuff and i still have
JpdUwxc6C60,180959,182560,that sound bar it was the flagship at
JpdUwxc6C60,182560,185840,that time q950d and it's fabulous uh you
JpdUwxc6C60,185840,188080,also have that q that q means q symphony
JpdUwxc6C60,188080,189760,so if you have a latest samsung what do
JpdUwxc6C60,189760,191680,you say uh that q-led tv range or
JpdUwxc6C60,191680,194480,whatever uh the sound you can
JpdUwxc6C60,194480,196959,output directly from the sandbox or you
JpdUwxc6C60,196959,198800,can also uh include the built-in
JpdUwxc6C60,198800,200640,speakers for better effect i am not
JpdUwxc6C60,200640,202159,using it with the what do you say a
JpdUwxc6C60,202159,204080,built-in tvs
JpdUwxc6C60,204080,205760,but just using the sound with the
JpdUwxc6C60,205760,207599,soundbar and it's actually really good
JpdUwxc6C60,207599,210480,um i am in fact there is a requirement
JpdUwxc6C60,210480,213360,for me for my new setup i might be
JpdUwxc6C60,213360,216000,looking at the new range of 2022 but
JpdUwxc6C60,216000,217599,i'll again be going with the flagship
JpdUwxc6C60,217599,219280,because i want it to be a permanent kind
JpdUwxc6C60,219280,221440,of a setup but again that q means that q
JpdUwxc6C60,221440,223280,symphony the only big difference is that
JpdUwxc6C60,223280,226080,if you have a samsung own qled tv or
JpdUwxc6C60,226080,227360,something
JpdUwxc6C60,227360,228799,it will work
JpdUwxc6C60,228799,230080,in conjunction with the built-in
JpdUwxc6C60,230080,232000,speakers of that tv you can disable that
JpdUwxc6C60,232000,234239,functionality but as a regular sandbar
JpdUwxc6C60,234239,235680,actually it works very well and i'm
JpdUwxc6C60,235680,237760,actually using it as a regular sound bar
JpdUwxc6C60,237760,240319,without that q symphony features uh in
JpdUwxc6C60,240319,242560,fact turned out to be much better at
JpdUwxc6C60,242560,244640,least the q5 950d i don't know about the
JpdUwxc6C60,244640,246879,budget range series
JpdUwxc6C60,246879,248400,this is by vikas
JpdUwxc6C60,248400,251120,uh hi run do you hope you are you and
JpdUwxc6C60,251120,252720,your family are recovering well yes sort
JpdUwxc6C60,252720,254799,of recovering not completely but yeah on
JpdUwxc6C60,254799,256639,the way i would say thank you for asking
JpdUwxc6C60,256639,257919,wanted to know if there is any
JpdUwxc6C60,257919,260239,alternative that comes to a iwatch that
JpdUwxc6C60,260239,262400,is an apple watch in the android space a
JpdUwxc6C60,262400,264720,friend has built a samsung ecosystem of
JpdUwxc6C60,264720,266960,watches and phone but wanted to know
JpdUwxc6C60,266960,268960,your thoughts sir because i'll be very
JpdUwxc6C60,268960,270720,blunt if you want that seamless
JpdUwxc6C60,270720,273520,ecosystem and if you are using an iphone
JpdUwxc6C60,273520,275840,and something the apple watch nothing
JpdUwxc6C60,275840,277440,even comes close to the app launch and
JpdUwxc6C60,277440,279040,i've tried everything for example this
JpdUwxc6C60,279040,281120,is the garmin watches are very expensive
JpdUwxc6C60,281120,283600,about 99 000 rupees of watch but still
JpdUwxc6C60,283600,285680,this also does not come anywhere close
JpdUwxc6C60,285680,288400,to the apple watch um the closest i
JpdUwxc6C60,288400,290160,would say in the android ecosystem is
JpdUwxc6C60,290160,292800,the galaxy watch series that you get but
JpdUwxc6C60,292800,295199,again the fit and finish and still the
JpdUwxc6C60,295199,296720,ecosystem that we have in the apple
JpdUwxc6C60,296720,299120,watch is still miles better that we get
JpdUwxc6C60,299120,300880,for the uh what do you say galaxy watch
JpdUwxc6C60,300880,301840,so again
JpdUwxc6C60,301840,303360,i'll be very blunt if you want the best
JpdUwxc6C60,303360,305680,smart watch and you can charge it every
JpdUwxc6C60,305680,308080,day then there is no competition as of
JpdUwxc6C60,308080,311759,now to the apple watch uh but on android
JpdUwxc6C60,311759,313440,uh if you're using an android phone of
JpdUwxc6C60,313440,315759,course it doesn't work with apple watch
JpdUwxc6C60,315759,317280,so the nearest
JpdUwxc6C60,317280,318960,competitor that you have is the galaxy
JpdUwxc6C60,318960,321120,watch series that you can have a look at
JpdUwxc6C60,321120,322400,that
JpdUwxc6C60,322400,323840,anyways moving to the next one this is
JpdUwxc6C60,323840,327120,by uh mr bakshi he's saying uh the
JpdUwxc6C60,327120,328639,smartphone market is getting way too
JpdUwxc6C60,328639,330720,saturated and the new launches uh on the
JpdUwxc6C60,330720,332240,smartphones are not that impre
JpdUwxc6C60,332240,334240,impressive to be honest yes i agree can
JpdUwxc6C60,334240,336479,you tell us what companies need to make
JpdUwxc6C60,336479,338800,the market interesting again and as it
JpdUwxc6C60,338800,341199,was in the earlier days uh mr bakshi i
JpdUwxc6C60,341199,343039,think so just too many
JpdUwxc6C60,343039,346160,uh senseless mindless launches are
JpdUwxc6C60,346160,348479,happening and these brands are hyping it
JpdUwxc6C60,348479,350560,like this this is the best next thing to
JpdUwxc6C60,350560,352720,the slide spread whereas it's not it's
JpdUwxc6C60,352720,354960,the same damn smartphone just changing
JpdUwxc6C60,354960,356960,the camera from 2 megapixel from here to
JpdUwxc6C60,356960,358720,here or doing something else the same
JpdUwxc6C60,358720,361840,stuff so i think so now users also we as
JpdUwxc6C60,361840,364400,reviewers have gotten bored of it users
JpdUwxc6C60,364400,366319,have got bored of it and they're just
JpdUwxc6C60,366319,368000,milking the same cat again and again
JpdUwxc6C60,368000,370000,there is hardly any innovation in fact
JpdUwxc6C60,370000,372160,brands should cut down on the amount of
JpdUwxc6C60,372160,373840,models that they are launching it's
JpdUwxc6C60,373840,377039,seriously irritating earlier it was good
JpdUwxc6C60,377039,378880,smartphone brands most of them used to
JpdUwxc6C60,378880,380639,have clear distinction at least in
JpdUwxc6C60,380639,382400,budget range and the mid-range they used
JpdUwxc6C60,382400,384479,to release one or good two models in
JpdUwxc6C60,384479,386479,mid-range one very solid product and in
JpdUwxc6C60,386479,387919,the higher end of course one or two
JpdUwxc6C60,387919,390240,products but now it's so diluted in
JpdUwxc6C60,390240,391759,mid-range they'll launch five odd
JpdUwxc6C60,391759,394000,products in the budget range they'll run
JpdUwxc6C60,394000,396639,for five products in the higher end plus
JpdUwxc6C60,396639,399680,pro ultra god knows what so it's so
JpdUwxc6C60,399680,401039,confusing right now and i think the
JpdUwxc6C60,401039,403280,users are also sort of fed up with this
JpdUwxc6C60,403280,405759,gimmicks and over hyping of stuff that
JpdUwxc6C60,405759,408160,has become so so common these days
JpdUwxc6C60,408160,409919,that's why these days i'm not that
JpdUwxc6C60,409919,411759,interested and excited about new
JpdUwxc6C60,411759,413759,smartphone launches because they hype it
JpdUwxc6C60,413759,414880,so much
JpdUwxc6C60,414880,415840,that
JpdUwxc6C60,415840,417680,when the smartphone comes out the
JpdUwxc6C60,417680,419680,reality is so so different and you get i
JpdUwxc6C60,419680,422080,frankly get disappointed anyways moving
JpdUwxc6C60,422080,425440,to the next one this is by uh mr
JpdUwxc6C60,425440,427599,shukla wishing you for a speedy recovery
JpdUwxc6C60,427599,430479,thank you as you mentioned uh before uh
JpdUwxc6C60,430479,432400,you try to apply your ot update wait
JpdUwxc6C60,432400,434400,around for 45 days as it appears on the
JpdUwxc6C60,434400,436560,device how do you decide safe or not or
JpdUwxc6C60,436560,438319,breaking the device again you have to
JpdUwxc6C60,438319,440160,wait because when a new ot update comes
JpdUwxc6C60,440160,441840,especially on android phones there is no
JpdUwxc6C60,441840,443840,guarantee that what that update is going
JpdUwxc6C60,443840,446560,to do and we have seen on many of these
JpdUwxc6C60,446560,448479,android smartphones it's not only from
JpdUwxc6C60,448479,450560,like chinese oems but even established
JpdUwxc6C60,450560,453120,vendors from alexa samsung etc after
JpdUwxc6C60,453120,455440,users are applying that update the uh
JpdUwxc6C60,455440,457360,some motherboards are having issues the
JpdUwxc6C60,457360,459280,display starts to have issues and stuff
JpdUwxc6C60,459280,461039,like that so it's become very very
JpdUwxc6C60,461039,463039,common now so that is the reason i tell
JpdUwxc6C60,463039,465199,even to my relatives when you get an ot
JpdUwxc6C60,465199,466800,update just don't rush out and put it
JpdUwxc6C60,466800,468479,out man what is the big deal about it
JpdUwxc6C60,468479,470080,your phone is working perfectly fine
JpdUwxc6C60,470080,471759,what will this update do these updates
JpdUwxc6C60,471759,473199,are actually crippling the devices and
JpdUwxc6C60,473199,475520,that's a fact so just wait for a month
JpdUwxc6C60,475520,476479,or so
JpdUwxc6C60,476479,477919,check the forums or something because
JpdUwxc6C60,477919,478960,sometimes
JpdUwxc6C60,478960,480560,the update only after a couple of days
JpdUwxc6C60,480560,482720,starts giving problems and you have seen
JpdUwxc6C60,482720,484400,with the galaxy s
JpdUwxc6C60,484400,487280,20 plus uh many users after the update
JpdUwxc6C60,487280,489199,the smartphone's display started to
JpdUwxc6C60,489199,490319,having
JpdUwxc6C60,490319,492560,problems uh for example it's not just
JpdUwxc6C60,492560,494560,software issues but even hardware issues
JpdUwxc6C60,494560,496000,and we have seen with a lot of other
JpdUwxc6C60,496000,497599,vendors that the
JpdUwxc6C60,497599,499599,motherboard just started to having uh
JpdUwxc6C60,499599,501120,issues the phone became so sluggish and
JpdUwxc6C60,501120,502400,when you go to the service center they
JpdUwxc6C60,502400,504479,say the motherboard is damaged so this
JpdUwxc6C60,504479,505840,is happening a lot and it is not just
JpdUwxc6C60,505840,507280,restricted to the mid-range smartphone
JpdUwxc6C60,507280,508720,or something this is even having to
JpdUwxc6C60,508720,511599,flagship so i would say be very very
JpdUwxc6C60,511599,513919,very careful uh if you have an android
JpdUwxc6C60,513919,515518,phone and that's slightly old when you
JpdUwxc6C60,515518,517760,get an ot update be very very careful
JpdUwxc6C60,517760,519839,i've warned you guys so many times
JpdUwxc6C60,519839,522640,happened in our own family also
JpdUwxc6C60,522640,524640,okay moving to the next one this is by
JpdUwxc6C60,524640,527680,uh mr ankit sharma he says great fan of
JpdUwxc6C60,527680,529120,your content thank you what do you think
JpdUwxc6C60,529120,531760,about streaming sticks like amazon fire
JpdUwxc6C60,531760,534800,tv me tv stick apple tv box where they
JpdUwxc6C60,534800,536720,stand in the age of smart tvs what are
JpdUwxc6C60,536720,538560,your top three picks of streaming boxes
JpdUwxc6C60,538560,540080,or sticks other options can be
JpdUwxc6C60,540080,542240,introduced i'm going to be very frank uh
JpdUwxc6C60,542240,545040,i had tested a few of these amazon fire
JpdUwxc6C60,545040,547839,stick or even the me stick extra
JpdUwxc6C60,547839,549440,but not from the past two two and a half
JpdUwxc6C60,549440,550240,years
JpdUwxc6C60,550240,551839,if you notice i haven't covered them
JpdUwxc6C60,551839,553600,because most of the smart tvs even the
JpdUwxc6C60,553600,555920,budget oriented smart tvs uh that come
JpdUwxc6C60,555920,557680,that are less than fifteen thousand have
JpdUwxc6C60,557680,559680,all these smart features integrated so
JpdUwxc6C60,559680,561120,if you're having a new tv or something
JpdUwxc6C60,561120,563360,like that it does not make sense to buy
JpdUwxc6C60,563360,565279,this the last one that i've used
JpdUwxc6C60,565279,567440,personally was the amazon fire stick in
JpdUwxc6C60,567440,570160,fact uh it's on my dad's
JpdUwxc6C60,570160,572160,tv it's a samsung tv that was not smart
JpdUwxc6C60,572160,574160,and still we are using that and it works
JpdUwxc6C60,574160,575760,fine but we didn't bother to upgrade
JpdUwxc6C60,575760,577279,with the latest one because the old one
JpdUwxc6C60,577279,580160,still works fine so again i feel this
JpdUwxc6C60,580160,582560,has become sort of a very niche market
JpdUwxc6C60,582560,584320,if you have a very old tv that does not
JpdUwxc6C60,584320,586160,have smart features or something then
JpdUwxc6C60,586160,587760,you can go with these ones because the
JpdUwxc6C60,587760,590000,tv might be perfectly working fine so
JpdUwxc6C60,590000,591519,that was the case with the samsung tv
JpdUwxc6C60,591519,593360,that we have is picture quality
JpdUwxc6C60,593360,595040,everything is working perfectly even but
JpdUwxc6C60,595040,597040,because it's become so old some that
JpdUwxc6C60,597040,598880,smart features are irrelevant that's why
JpdUwxc6C60,598880,600399,that smart uh what do you say amazon
JpdUwxc6C60,600399,602399,fire stick makes sense on that but again
JpdUwxc6C60,602399,604640,if you have a modern tv these don't make
JpdUwxc6C60,604640,605600,sense
JpdUwxc6C60,605600,607360,anyways moving to the next one this is
JpdUwxc6C60,607360,610160,from mr air please recommend a tv
JpdUwxc6C60,610160,611920,requirement is to watch movies in the
JpdUwxc6C60,611920,614880,best resolution and to play games on ps5
JpdUwxc6C60,614880,617839,xbox need to be smart tv as well screen
JpdUwxc6C60,617839,620320,size 55 to 60 inches which should be
JpdUwxc6C60,620320,622720,ideal for my home uh if recommending
JpdUwxc6C60,622720,625279,chinese brand uh how safe are they
JpdUwxc6C60,625279,627120,okay let's first talk about sizes
JpdUwxc6C60,627120,629760,because i have multiple screens for
JpdUwxc6C60,629760,632560,example we have 55
JpdUwxc6C60,632560,635200,tv in the house 65 and even 75 and i
JpdUwxc6C60,635200,637200,would say for most of them uh most of
JpdUwxc6C60,637200,639920,you guys the sweet spot is between 55 to
JpdUwxc6C60,639920,642640,65 the 75 becomes just too big in my
JpdUwxc6C60,642640,645279,frank opinion so again based on your
JpdUwxc6C60,645279,646720,what he says
JpdUwxc6C60,646720,649120,area what do you have the screen a 55
JpdUwxc6C60,649120,650240,should be good enough but if you have a
JpdUwxc6C60,650240,652399,slightly larger space or something a 65
JpdUwxc6C60,652399,654560,might even do good because these days uh
JpdUwxc6C60,654560,655920,the pricing
JpdUwxc6C60,655920,657760,prequel for the 65 is not that high the
JpdUwxc6C60,657760,660240,75 is still very high so look for that
JpdUwxc6C60,660240,662320,of course it will be a 4k tv
JpdUwxc6C60,662320,664640,no need to go over the 8k as of now and
JpdUwxc6C60,664640,666399,if you want that future proofing make
JpdUwxc6C60,666399,669360,sure it has supports hdmi 2.1 because
JpdUwxc6C60,669360,671600,that'll support 120 hertz which the new
JpdUwxc6C60,671600,673839,consoles like the ps5 and the xbox will
JpdUwxc6C60,673839,675680,support so look at that again there will
JpdUwxc6C60,675680,677440,be a premium most of the budget tvs
JpdUwxc6C60,677440,679200,won't do that but again invest in a good
JpdUwxc6C60,679200,681519,tv and i would say if you don't like
JpdUwxc6C60,681519,683200,changing your tvs for four or five years
JpdUwxc6C60,683200,685040,and want to keep like that for example i
JpdUwxc6C60,685040,687440,i whenever i invest in a tv i some good
JpdUwxc6C60,687440,690399,tvs and my tvs we generally changed once
JpdUwxc6C60,690399,692880,in about eight nine years and we had
JpdUwxc6C60,692880,695200,very good luck with samsung sony and lg
JpdUwxc6C60,695200,697519,tvs not that good luck with the chinese
JpdUwxc6C60,697519,699120,counterparts we had to change it after
JpdUwxc6C60,699120,701120,two and a half years i'd be very planned
JpdUwxc6C60,701120,702720,about that
JpdUwxc6C60,702720,704399,anyways moving to the next one this is
JpdUwxc6C60,704399,707279,by sarkar with so many moto devices out
JpdUwxc6C60,707279,709120,there which one would be the best
JpdUwxc6C60,709120,711200,mid-range premium mid-range of on the
JpdUwxc6C60,711200,713040,moto to go for um
JpdUwxc6C60,713040,714880,sarkar with moto at least for the gc
JpdUwxc6C60,714880,717040,it's very simple it's the naming
JpdUwxc6C60,717040,718880,for example let's say it's the 30 series
JpdUwxc6C60,718880,721120,let's say 31 then they have the 5 series
JpdUwxc6C60,721120,723839,50 152 like that the higher the series
JpdUwxc6C60,723839,725360,scores the more premium it is so it's
JpdUwxc6C60,725360,728160,very simple the moto g31 will be the
JpdUwxc6C60,728160,730480,basic the g52 would be the mid-ranger
JpdUwxc6C60,730480,733120,the 72 or the 8182 what is the current
JpdUwxc6C60,733120,735680,one is the flagship so with the g series
JpdUwxc6C60,735680,737760,it's very simple it's the number thing
JpdUwxc6C60,737760,740000,that you're looking at the first number
JpdUwxc6C60,740000,742399,specifies uh which range it is the three
JpdUwxc6C60,742399,745600,means uh lower uh range five is in the
JpdUwxc6C60,745600,747200,middle and of course the higher one
JpdUwxc6C60,747200,749040,seven eight it's on the slightly on the
JpdUwxc6C60,749040,751360,top end again uh with the g series you
JpdUwxc6C60,751360,753040,won't get the cutting edge processor for
JpdUwxc6C60,753040,754880,that you'll have to move to the edge
JpdUwxc6C60,754880,756880,series the edge series are the sort of
JpdUwxc6C60,756880,758880,the premium one in the motor range i
JpdUwxc6C60,758880,761200,hope that answers the question
JpdUwxc6C60,761200,764720,uh this is by mr kumar he says
JpdUwxc6C60,764720,766399,hi sir can you tell us is it worth
JpdUwxc6C60,766399,768079,investing over a lakh for an android
JpdUwxc6C60,768079,770160,phone example the samsung galaxy s22
JpdUwxc6C60,770160,772880,ultra or stick with iphone okay let me
JpdUwxc6C60,772880,774320,answer this question because i'm getting
JpdUwxc6C60,774320,776959,this question a lot from you guys
JpdUwxc6C60,776959,777920,and
JpdUwxc6C60,777920,780000,i would say at least i'll i'll give you
JpdUwxc6C60,780000,782079,my example of what i would do in my
JpdUwxc6C60,782079,783440,family
JpdUwxc6C60,783440,785519,seeing the situation of the android
JpdUwxc6C60,785519,787279,phone updates that is happening and i'll
JpdUwxc6C60,787279,790000,give you my personal example for example
JpdUwxc6C60,790000,791920,uh mine and if you had the
JpdUwxc6C60,791920,793839,what is that one plus seven pro working
JpdUwxc6C60,793839,796000,perfectly fine just after the ot update
JpdUwxc6C60,796000,797600,the phone became slow sluggish after
JpdUwxc6C60,797600,799279,three days at night and he went to the
JpdUwxc6C60,799279,800880,service center needs to change the
JpdUwxc6C60,800880,802880,motherboard they said i had and for
JpdUwxc6C60,802880,806079,example uh my wife had the galaxy note
JpdUwxc6C60,806079,808880,20 ultra the phone was working perfectly
JpdUwxc6C60,808880,811360,fine and i had wonder
JpdUwxc6C60,811360,813120,my wife she said one update was coming i
JpdUwxc6C60,813120,815120,told her not to update it
JpdUwxc6C60,815120,817600,but i don't know she forgot about it but
JpdUwxc6C60,817600,819519,accidentally clicked on that update or
JpdUwxc6C60,819519,821040,whatever
JpdUwxc6C60,821040,823680,and the phone got updated and after just
JpdUwxc6C60,823680,824800,two days
JpdUwxc6C60,824800,825600,the
JpdUwxc6C60,825600,828000,display of the phone completely right so
JpdUwxc6C60,828000,829839,i don't get it what is happening with
JpdUwxc6C60,829839,831279,android updates and i'm not just
JpdUwxc6C60,831279,833279,specific to one brand happening a lot
JpdUwxc6C60,833279,834639,with chinese brands and even with
JpdUwxc6C60,834639,836959,premium brands like samsung so i would
JpdUwxc6C60,836959,839839,say i cannot vouch
JpdUwxc6C60,839839,842800,for the longevity of an android phone as
JpdUwxc6C60,842800,844959,of now considering
JpdUwxc6C60,844959,847600,various uh examples that i've seen in my
JpdUwxc6C60,847600,849199,own family
JpdUwxc6C60,849199,851519,so i would say if you are a person and i
JpdUwxc6C60,851519,854240,know for example my friends and some
JpdUwxc6C60,854240,856639,elders also when they are asking me to
JpdUwxc6C60,856639,859040,buy a new phone i know i know they these
JpdUwxc6C60,859040,860639,guys don't want to upgrade every two
JpdUwxc6C60,860639,861839,years or three years they want to keep
JpdUwxc6C60,861839,864000,it for four years and for them all of
JpdUwxc6C60,864000,866880,them i am giving them now an iphone
JpdUwxc6C60,866880,868959,because personally i know we have
JpdUwxc6C60,868959,871600,iphones in our family that are almost
JpdUwxc6C60,871600,873199,six years old and still they are working
JpdUwxc6C60,873199,875600,perfectly fine don't need to upgrade
JpdUwxc6C60,875600,878160,that simply is not the case now with
JpdUwxc6C60,878160,879600,most of the android phone even the
JpdUwxc6C60,879600,882240,flagship ones that is the reason uh i
JpdUwxc6C60,882240,883600,would say if you're changing your phone
JpdUwxc6C60,883600,885519,every two years flying go with an
JpdUwxc6C60,885519,887040,android phone most of the android phones
JpdUwxc6C60,887040,889199,will last for that time but now the
JpdUwxc6C60,889199,891360,problem is with some of the ota updates
JpdUwxc6C60,891360,893440,after one and a half two years these
JpdUwxc6C60,893440,895600,manufacturers are leaving so bad updates
JpdUwxc6C60,895600,897279,on android phones that they are actually
JpdUwxc6C60,897279,899360,breaking the devices having physical
JpdUwxc6C60,899360,901199,problems with the devices
JpdUwxc6C60,901199,902959,that is not the case with the iphones as
JpdUwxc6C60,902959,905839,of now so i would say uh
JpdUwxc6C60,905839,907600,i would go with an iphone because if i
JpdUwxc6C60,907600,909920,know a person who's not that interested
JpdUwxc6C60,909920,911120,in changing the phone he wants the
JpdUwxc6C60,911120,912240,longitudinality of let's say i've
JpdUwxc6C60,912240,913839,invested a lack i want the phone to last
JpdUwxc6C60,913839,915600,for four or five years if that kind of a
JpdUwxc6C60,915600,917680,person then i would recommend the iphone
JpdUwxc6C60,917680,919519,for you and that's the reason uh my
JpdUwxc6C60,919519,921600,second phone is still uh i'm keeping the
JpdUwxc6C60,921600,924079,iphone 13 pro right i i still even have
JpdUwxc6C60,924079,927600,the iphone 10r and works perfectly fine
JpdUwxc6C60,927600,929199,there is no slowdown or anything like
JpdUwxc6C60,929199,930959,that and that's the beauty with an
JpdUwxc6C60,930959,933519,iphone uh you buy an iphone you are not
JpdUwxc6C60,933519,935279,compelled to buy the next version
JpdUwxc6C60,935279,938240,because the ui and general operations is
JpdUwxc6C60,938240,941120,almost the same as the your older iphone
JpdUwxc6C60,941120,943279,apart from one or two new bells and
JpdUwxc6C60,943279,944399,whistles
JpdUwxc6C60,944399,946480,anyways moving to the next one this is
JpdUwxc6C60,946480,948480,by uh
JpdUwxc6C60,948480,951279,uh i am super sum uh
JpdUwxc6C60,951279,953440,i'm a bit more curious about the nothing
JpdUwxc6C60,953440,954880,phone he says what are your thoughts
JpdUwxc6C60,954880,957120,about the phone as the hype is so much
JpdUwxc6C60,957120,958560,in the market i want to know your
JpdUwxc6C60,958560,961040,thoughts yes uh the nothing phone has a
JpdUwxc6C60,961040,962880,lot of hype and i think so
JpdUwxc6C60,962880,964720,that is what that company knows to do
JpdUwxc6C60,964720,966800,that they are the masters of hyping
JpdUwxc6C60,966800,968320,things and that's what they are doing
JpdUwxc6C60,968320,971519,right now teasing stuff in small doses
JpdUwxc6C60,971519,972880,and stuff like that to create your
JpdUwxc6C60,972880,974079,curiosity
JpdUwxc6C60,974079,976880,but to be very frank in even mkbsd
JpdUwxc6C60,976880,978480,posted a video and i did not see that
JpdUwxc6C60,978480,980399,video because i just don't want to fall
JpdUwxc6C60,980399,982480,in for that hype so whenever that phone
JpdUwxc6C60,982480,984560,will come out i will look at it i'm
JpdUwxc6C60,984560,986639,trying to keep all the hype aside
JpdUwxc6C60,986639,989040,because as i've told you guys i'm fed up
JpdUwxc6C60,989040,991040,of this hyping of stuff that is going on
JpdUwxc6C60,991040,992800,in the market i know the phone should be
JpdUwxc6C60,992800,994560,pretty good it'll be having the
JpdUwxc6C60,994560,997199,snapdragon 7 gen 1 so that's a good
JpdUwxc6C60,997199,998800,processor uh first time it will be
JpdUwxc6C60,998800,1001360,coming on the nothing phone so uh it's
JpdUwxc6C60,1001360,1002399,sort of the replacement of the
JpdUwxc6C60,1002399,1004639,snapdragon 778 which was supposed to be
JpdUwxc6C60,1004639,1006399,a very good processor so processor wise
JpdUwxc6C60,1006399,1009040,is very good and i think so the nothing
JpdUwxc6C60,1009040,1010560,phone will get a lot of basics right but
JpdUwxc6C60,1010560,1012800,it'll be very interesting to see how do
JpdUwxc6C60,1012800,1014720,they price it in india
JpdUwxc6C60,1014720,1016800,as they're going to build it in india so
JpdUwxc6C60,1016800,1018160,i think so the pricing at least in india
JpdUwxc6C60,1018160,1020000,will be aggressive anywhere from 30 to
JpdUwxc6C60,1020000,1023519,35 000 is my wall park case but whenever
JpdUwxc6C60,1023519,1025438,the product comes out let's see how it
JpdUwxc6C60,1025438,1027120,is just don't want to comment about it
JpdUwxc6C60,1027120,1028798,based on the hypes and the leaks that
JpdUwxc6C60,1028798,1030319,are going on
JpdUwxc6C60,1030319,1033678,uh this is by mr cochran uh he says i'm
JpdUwxc6C60,1033678,1036720,planning to buy a macbook air m2 from my
JpdUwxc6C60,1036720,1038959,old windows laptop should i wait for the
JpdUwxc6C60,1038959,1041678,rumored 15 inch m2a i need a dual
JpdUwxc6C60,1041678,1043280,monitor support and don't want the
JpdUwxc6C60,1043280,1045120,macbook pro as it's bulky it'll be used
JpdUwxc6C60,1045120,1047199,for coding browsing youtubing
JpdUwxc6C60,1047199,1050559,etc no heavy user uh the thing is that
JpdUwxc6C60,1050559,1052640,as you tell you're waiting for the uh 15
JpdUwxc6C60,1052640,1056160,inch macbook air that's rumored guys uh
JpdUwxc6C60,1056160,1057760,it's just apple rumors based on apple
JpdUwxc6C60,1057760,1060320,rumors sometime in 2023 you'll get but
JpdUwxc6C60,1060320,1062000,as you have told you want dual monitor
JpdUwxc6C60,1062000,1064720,support uh the thing is that apple on
JpdUwxc6C60,1064720,1068080,the macbook air series do not
JpdUwxc6C60,1068080,1069760,provide your support for dual monitor
JpdUwxc6C60,1069760,1071760,support that is reserved for the pro and
JpdUwxc6C60,1071760,1073440,the higher end series even with the new
JpdUwxc6C60,1073440,1076320,macbook air m2 you can only connect one
JpdUwxc6C60,1076320,1078559,external monitor you cannot connect two
JpdUwxc6C60,1078559,1079919,external monitors so if you want to
JpdUwxc6C60,1079919,1081919,connect two external monitors you will
JpdUwxc6C60,1081919,1084480,have to go to the pro series so be aware
JpdUwxc6C60,1084480,1086400,of that and i think so that's how apple
JpdUwxc6C60,1086400,1088080,is differentiating their products if you
JpdUwxc6C60,1088080,1090160,want those dual monitor setups you're
JpdUwxc6C60,1090160,1091760,sort of a pro user so they are pushing
JpdUwxc6C60,1091760,1093919,you to the port so even if the macbook
JpdUwxc6C60,1093919,1096080,air 15 inch comes out rumored whatever
JpdUwxc6C60,1096080,1098080,in 23 i don't think so apple will
JpdUwxc6C60,1098080,1100720,support natively dual monitor support on
JpdUwxc6C60,1100720,1102880,that one they're restricted to the pro
JpdUwxc6C60,1102880,1105360,series that's my frank opinion even in
JpdUwxc6C60,1105360,1106799,the pro series for example this is the
JpdUwxc6C60,1106799,1108960,macbook pro 16 inch i have
JpdUwxc6C60,1108960,1111760,with the uh uh
JpdUwxc6C60,1111760,1114559,and it's not the m1 max m1 max supports
JpdUwxc6C60,1114559,1116160,three monitors this one does supports
JpdUwxc6C60,1116160,1118080,only two so if i want three monitors i
JpdUwxc6C60,1118080,1120000,would have go for the max chip so that's
JpdUwxc6C60,1120000,1121600,how apple is different differentiating
JpdUwxc6C60,1121600,1123200,their products
JpdUwxc6C60,1123200,1124720,okay this is the last question so let's
JpdUwxc6C60,1124720,1126320,get on with this i need my throat is
JpdUwxc6C60,1126320,1128799,hurting so let's end this uh this is by
JpdUwxc6C60,1128799,1129760,the
JpdUwxc6C60,1129760,1131120,way
JpdUwxc6C60,1131120,1132960,what can uh we expect from the
JpdUwxc6C60,1132960,1135120,snapdragon 7gen1 which is coming in the
JpdUwxc6C60,1135120,1137440,nothing phone one also what about the
JpdUwxc6C60,1137440,1139039,service center india considering it's a
JpdUwxc6C60,1139039,1141039,new and independent kind of uh company a
JpdUwxc6C60,1141039,1143120,very interesting question yes i'm pretty
JpdUwxc6C60,1143120,1144559,sure in terms of performance the
JpdUwxc6C60,1144559,1145600,snapdragon
JpdUwxc6C60,1145600,1147200,7 gen 1 should be very good as i have
JpdUwxc6C60,1147200,1148240,today it's a replacement of the
JpdUwxc6C60,1148240,1150960,snapdragon 78 but again guys this
JpdUwxc6C60,1150960,1152720,chipset won't be exclusive to the
JpdUwxc6C60,1152720,1153919,nothing phone
JpdUwxc6C60,1153919,1155520,the first smartphone in india that will
JpdUwxc6C60,1155520,1157120,be coming out will be the nothing but
JpdUwxc6C60,1157120,1158960,i'm pretty sure after that many of the
JpdUwxc6C60,1158960,1160240,other vendors like maybe samsung
JpdUwxc6C60,1160240,1161919,motorola and others will come out with
JpdUwxc6C60,1161919,1164640,the other phones with the snapdragon 711
JpdUwxc6C60,1164640,1166880,but yeah regarding service centers that
JpdUwxc6C60,1166880,1168880,is a big question mark with the nothing
JpdUwxc6C60,1168880,1170960,phone because this is a totally new
JpdUwxc6C60,1170960,1175200,brand and not part of the oppo bbk group
JpdUwxc6C60,1175200,1179280,so how will they provide service uh in
JpdUwxc6C60,1179280,1181760,case of issues in throughout the india
JpdUwxc6C60,1181760,1183440,is going to be a big question mark let's
