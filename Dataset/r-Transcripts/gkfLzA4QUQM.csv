gkfLzA4QUQM,20000,22160,instagram in a few weeks so in today's
gkfLzA4QUQM,22160,23199,video i feel like it's kind of the
gkfLzA4QUQM,23199,24960,summer theme you have a lot of products
gkfLzA4QUQM,24960,26880,that can appeal to people who travel are
gkfLzA4QUQM,26880,29039,looking to improve their desk setups or
gkfLzA4QUQM,29039,31599,also just planning to go outside because
gkfLzA4QUQM,31599,33520,we have this projector from nomadic
gkfLzA4QUQM,33520,35920,which is in a nice four screen color it
gkfLzA4QUQM,35920,38559,is very portable and easy to use as well
gkfLzA4QUQM,38559,41120,as sony's brand new headphones which are
gkfLzA4QUQM,41120,43120,the new xm5s and if you're doing a ton
gkfLzA4QUQM,43120,45360,of traveling these are must-haves and
gkfLzA4QUQM,45360,47920,there's also the logitech mx mechanical
gkfLzA4QUQM,47920,50079,keyboard that i checked out recently and
gkfLzA4QUQM,50079,51680,that is something that can really make a
gkfLzA4QUQM,51680,53680,difference to your daily productivity
gkfLzA4QUQM,53680,55600,workflow so without further ado let's go
gkfLzA4QUQM,55600,57280,ahead and get started and as always all
gkfLzA4QUQM,57280,58719,the products are going to be linked down
gkfLzA4QUQM,58719,61039,below
gkfLzA4QUQM,63039,64720,so with a ton of travel coming up this
gkfLzA4QUQM,64720,66320,product could have come out at a better
gkfLzA4QUQM,66320,69400,time and that is the brand new sony
gkfLzA4QUQM,69400,72560,wh-1000 xm5s the name is something that
gkfLzA4QUQM,72560,74000,they still haven't updated but this
gkfLzA4QUQM,74000,76479,headphone is a refresh to sony's
gkfLzA4QUQM,76479,78479,flagship active noise cancellation
gkfLzA4QUQM,78479,80240,headphones and it's essentially their
gkfLzA4QUQM,80240,82000,best combination of active noise
gkfLzA4QUQM,82000,84479,cancellation as well as sound quality
gkfLzA4QUQM,84479,85759,the first thing that you're gonna notice
gkfLzA4QUQM,85759,88159,is that the design is slightly refined
gkfLzA4QUQM,88159,89520,you can see it just has like a very
gkfLzA4QUQM,89520,91439,simple and minimal look and that is an
gkfLzA4QUQM,91439,93759,approach that bose has also gone with as
gkfLzA4QUQM,93759,94560,well
gkfLzA4QUQM,94560,96479,i think sony's design has always been
gkfLzA4QUQM,96479,98720,quite good i liked it in both like the
gkfLzA4QUQM,98720,100560,white and the black version but i feel
gkfLzA4QUQM,100560,102640,like the white version is able to hide
gkfLzA4QUQM,102640,104880,fingerprints a lot better it still has a
gkfLzA4QUQM,104880,107040,very durable fit to it
gkfLzA4QUQM,107040,108799,but it does have quite a bit of plastic
gkfLzA4QUQM,108799,110799,considering it comes in at the price of
gkfLzA4QUQM,110799,112479,about four hundred dollars the
gkfLzA4QUQM,112479,114640,multi-noise sensor technology features
gkfLzA4QUQM,114640,116880,eight microphones and it's able to
gkfLzA4QUQM,116880,118880,capture that ambient sound and
gkfLzA4QUQM,118880,120880,accurately reduce the high frequency
gkfLzA4QUQM,120880,123600,noise thanks to the auto nc optimizer
gkfLzA4QUQM,123600,125520,something that sony has focused a lot on
gkfLzA4QUQM,125520,127600,is in their processing and this has the
gkfLzA4QUQM,127600,130560,hd noise cancelling processor qn1 as
gkfLzA4QUQM,130560,133360,well as the integrated processor v1 in
gkfLzA4QUQM,133360,134800,terms of noise cancellation i've had
gkfLzA4QUQM,134800,137360,some great experiences on the market but
gkfLzA4QUQM,137360,139520,this is probably the best available at
gkfLzA4QUQM,139520,141040,the moment and when it comes to the
gkfLzA4QUQM,141040,143280,actual sound quality it features a new
gkfLzA4QUQM,143280,145599,30 millimeter driver which has a nice
gkfLzA4QUQM,145599,147360,like tight sound to it but at the same
gkfLzA4QUQM,147360,149680,time is very well balanced and still
gkfLzA4QUQM,149680,151840,delivers quite a bit of bass the form
gkfLzA4QUQM,151840,153519,factor itself definitely reflects quite
gkfLzA4QUQM,153519,155280,a bit of power when it comes to its
gkfLzA4QUQM,155280,157040,setup and the total battery life that it
gkfLzA4QUQM,157040,160400,is able to deliver is about 30 hours so
gkfLzA4QUQM,160400,162160,when you're looking for a headphone that
gkfLzA4QUQM,162160,164080,is able to block out all the ambient
gkfLzA4QUQM,164080,166879,noise on a plane for example then this
gkfLzA4QUQM,166879,168959,is an option that could be a go-to
gkfLzA4QUQM,168959,171440,product if you travel a ton but this
gkfLzA4QUQM,171440,173440,option right here is probably the best
gkfLzA4QUQM,173440,175840,noise cancellation with very good sound
gkfLzA4QUQM,175840,178080,quality whereas the bose 700 is maybe a
gkfLzA4QUQM,178080,179760,little bit more portable and still has
gkfLzA4QUQM,179760,181280,pretty good sound quality and even
gkfLzA4QUQM,181280,183040,though i really like the sound that the
gkfLzA4QUQM,183040,185760,airpod max is able to produce it is just
gkfLzA4QUQM,185760,187519,way too big and i don't really find the
gkfLzA4QUQM,187519,189519,comfort to be that good so i think this
gkfLzA4QUQM,189519,192820,is a very compelling option right here
gkfLzA4QUQM,192820,197280,[Music]
gkfLzA4QUQM,197280,198640,so the next set of products are ones
gkfLzA4QUQM,198640,200080,that you can definitely add to your desk
gkfLzA4QUQM,200080,202720,setup and it is from logitech they
gkfLzA4QUQM,202720,204720,actually had a few releases in the past
gkfLzA4QUQM,204720,206319,month some of which were more minor
gkfLzA4QUQM,206319,208959,updates whereas others are a bit of a
gkfLzA4QUQM,208959,210239,different form factor and maybe
gkfLzA4QUQM,210239,211760,something that you're not quite used to
gkfLzA4QUQM,211760,214480,from logitech but the first one is the
gkfLzA4QUQM,214480,216640,mx mechanical keyboard if you guys want
gkfLzA4QUQM,216640,217760,to go ahead and check out the full
gkfLzA4QUQM,217760,220080,review and detailed comparison on my
gkfLzA4QUQM,220080,221760,channel i'll have a link to that down
gkfLzA4QUQM,221760,223599,below but this is a mechanical version
gkfLzA4QUQM,223599,226480,of the logitech mx keys which is more of
gkfLzA4QUQM,226480,228480,a productivity keyboard which you
gkfLzA4QUQM,228480,230159,normally wouldn't attribute with a
gkfLzA4QUQM,230159,231920,mechanical option but i do feel like in
gkfLzA4QUQM,231920,233680,the past couple years mechanical
gkfLzA4QUQM,233680,235519,keyboards have become increasingly
gkfLzA4QUQM,235519,238480,popular in use of productivity or just
gkfLzA4QUQM,238480,241280,day-to-day typing as opposed to what was
gkfLzA4QUQM,241280,244080,normally more so for gaming before
gkfLzA4QUQM,244080,245439,there's been a lot of good options on
gkfLzA4QUQM,245439,247120,the market there's like keychron for
gkfLzA4QUQM,247120,249599,example and like the habit which is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,249599,252000,very nice budget price and the logitech
gkfLzA4QUQM,252000,253680,keyboards tend to come in at a price
gkfLzA4QUQM,253680,257440,point between 100 and 150 dollars and
gkfLzA4QUQM,257440,259519,this is the mechanical keyboard that is
gkfLzA4QUQM,259519,261519,available in both the mini version right
gkfLzA4QUQM,261519,263919,here as well as in a version that has
gkfLzA4QUQM,263919,266000,the number pad what's cool about it is
gkfLzA4QUQM,266000,267680,that it is a mechanical keyboard that
gkfLzA4QUQM,267680,269919,has three different switch options so
gkfLzA4QUQM,269919,272080,this is the brown switch the more like
gkfLzA4QUQM,272080,274320,soft and tactile one that still has a
gkfLzA4QUQM,274320,276639,bit of audible feedback there's also one
gkfLzA4QUQM,276639,277840,that is in the middle and there's
gkfLzA4QUQM,277840,280000,another that is a lot more clicky and
gkfLzA4QUQM,280000,282720,you can pick between the brown the red
gkfLzA4QUQM,282720,285040,and the blue choice and personally i
gkfLzA4QUQM,285040,286720,think the blue one is the one that is
gkfLzA4QUQM,286720,288560,best suited for me but i've also really
gkfLzA4QUQM,288560,290400,liked the brown one right here one of
gkfLzA4QUQM,290400,291919,the biggest observations that i have is
gkfLzA4QUQM,291919,293840,that when it comes to key travel it is
gkfLzA4QUQM,293840,296320,right in the middle it doesn't have like
gkfLzA4QUQM,296320,298400,too much travel like a full-size gaming
gkfLzA4QUQM,298400,300560,keyboard but at the same time it isn't a
gkfLzA4QUQM,300560,302560,laptop keyboard i think it's a perfect
gkfLzA4QUQM,302560,304639,amount if you do a ton of typing on a
gkfLzA4QUQM,304639,306639,day-to-day basis and this is why i think
gkfLzA4QUQM,306639,308720,this is going to be very popular they
gkfLzA4QUQM,308720,311199,also launched the mx-3s
gkfLzA4QUQM,311199,313680,mouse which is a lot quieter and it has
gkfLzA4QUQM,313680,315840,a higher dpi rating but that is more of
gkfLzA4QUQM,315840,318160,a minor incremental update but another
gkfLzA4QUQM,318160,320080,product that has increasing popularity
gkfLzA4QUQM,320080,323280,lately is the vertical ergonomics this
gkfLzA4QUQM,323280,325520,is a logitech lift and it comes in at a
gkfLzA4QUQM,325520,327520,price point that is quite a bit under a
gkfLzA4QUQM,327520,329520,hundred dollars which i think is very
gkfLzA4QUQM,329520,331680,reasonable and it is available in quite
gkfLzA4QUQM,331680,333840,a few fun colors as well i personally
gkfLzA4QUQM,333840,335759,have to use the mx master mouse because
gkfLzA4QUQM,335759,337680,of the horizontal scrolling for video
gkfLzA4QUQM,337680,340800,editing but this vertical form factor is
gkfLzA4QUQM,340800,342880,good for ergonomics when it comes to
gkfLzA4QUQM,342880,345360,just giving your wrist a bit of a break
gkfLzA4QUQM,345360,347039,a lot of times having your hand in this
gkfLzA4QUQM,347039,349360,position for many hours a day is a bit
gkfLzA4QUQM,349360,351199,awkward and so if you want to get past
gkfLzA4QUQM,351199,354000,that then i think this logitech lift is
gkfLzA4QUQM,354000,356240,the perfect solution it does have like a
gkfLzA4QUQM,356240,358400,nice scroll wheel there's also a bit of
gkfLzA4QUQM,358400,360479,a control right here and buttons on the
gkfLzA4QUQM,360479,362240,side but as i mentioned if you need the
gkfLzA4QUQM,362240,364880,horizontal scrolling then the mx master
gkfLzA4QUQM,364880,366720,is your only option from a design
gkfLzA4QUQM,366720,368720,standpoint it looks great it has a soft
gkfLzA4QUQM,368720,370800,touch finish for the palm and it has the
gkfLzA4QUQM,370800,372560,same ridges that you find on their
gkfLzA4QUQM,372560,374960,flagship mouse so yeah if you guys want
gkfLzA4QUQM,374960,376479,to check this out these are some new
gkfLzA4QUQM,376479,378319,products from logitech that came out
gkfLzA4QUQM,378319,381319,recently
gkfLzA4QUQM,383470,387280,[Music]
gkfLzA4QUQM,387280,388960,so one of my favorite items to check out
gkfLzA4QUQM,388960,390880,on the channel is projectors and we have
gkfLzA4QUQM,390880,392880,covered a ton of them there's ones that
gkfLzA4QUQM,392880,395199,have like very large image throws as
gkfLzA4QUQM,395199,397120,well as like laser tvs that are more
gkfLzA4QUQM,397120,399039,short throw but at the same time i feel
gkfLzA4QUQM,399039,400720,like this is a category that has seen a
gkfLzA4QUQM,400720,402479,ton of improvement especially in the
gkfLzA4QUQM,402479,404240,past couple years this right here is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,404240,406000,nomadic x300 and i want to give a huge
gkfLzA4QUQM,406000,407520,thanks to them for sponsoring this video
gkfLzA4QUQM,407520,408639,and if you want to go ahead and check it
gkfLzA4QUQM,408639,410080,out for yourself i'm going to drop a
gkfLzA4QUQM,410080,411759,link down below but there's a few
gkfLzA4QUQM,411759,413360,elements of it that i really enjoy
gkfLzA4QUQM,413360,415840,including the design the sound quality
gkfLzA4QUQM,415840,418160,the overall form factor as well as just
gkfLzA4QUQM,418160,420080,the ease of portability to be able to
gkfLzA4QUQM,420080,421840,bring this with you everywhere whether
gkfLzA4QUQM,421840,423919,you're going camping staying at a cabin
gkfLzA4QUQM,423919,425759,for a week you can literally just put
gkfLzA4QUQM,425759,427680,this in the car take it with you and
gkfLzA4QUQM,427680,430000,enjoy movies at a large scale like a
gkfLzA4QUQM,430000,431680,hundred inches so from a design
gkfLzA4QUQM,431680,432880,standpoint this has got to be one of the
gkfLzA4QUQM,432880,434240,best looking projectors that i've
gkfLzA4QUQM,434240,436080,checked out to date it has like this
gkfLzA4QUQM,436080,438000,nice finish that goes all the way around
gkfLzA4QUQM,438000,440240,in this forest olive green color which
gkfLzA4QUQM,440240,442080,is very popular you've seen apple do it
gkfLzA4QUQM,442080,444400,recently as well as like a gold trim
gkfLzA4QUQM,444400,446000,that goes throughout with the metal
gkfLzA4QUQM,446000,448160,finish and a grill on the front the
gkfLzA4QUQM,448160,449440,general form factor is laid out in the
gkfLzA4QUQM,449440,450800,fact that you have a mirror on the top
gkfLzA4QUQM,450800,452880,that is able to reflect that image up to
gkfLzA4QUQM,452880,455599,100 inches at a full hd resolution but
gkfLzA4QUQM,455599,456800,beyond that you have all of your
gkfLzA4QUQM,456800,459440,controls along the top here and just
gkfLzA4QUQM,459440,461120,some of the specifics of connecting the
gkfLzA4QUQM,461120,462639,audio as well because you can use this
gkfLzA4QUQM,462639,464400,as a speaker what is nice if you want to
gkfLzA4QUQM,464400,465599,take this anywhere with you there is
gkfLzA4QUQM,465599,467599,like a leather strap that you can just
gkfLzA4QUQM,467599,469360,like carry it around like a lunchbox or
gkfLzA4QUQM,469360,471680,a bluetooth speaker and there's also a
gkfLzA4QUQM,471680,473520,partnership with harman kardon here
gkfLzA4QUQM,473520,474960,where they've built like a custom
gkfLzA4QUQM,474960,476560,speaker setup that is not only able to
gkfLzA4QUQM,476560,478000,give you great music listening
gkfLzA4QUQM,478000,480160,experience but also enjoying it through
gkfLzA4QUQM,480160,481919,movies and tv shows that you want to
gkfLzA4QUQM,481919,483759,watch with the projector going into the
gkfLzA4QUQM,483759,485120,specs of the display it's it will give
gkfLzA4QUQM,485120,488000,you a 1080p full hd resolution with a
gkfLzA4QUQM,488000,490479,superb color range and a 3 million to 1
gkfLzA4QUQM,490479,492400,contrast ratio it totals it's just about
gkfLzA4QUQM,492400,495440,a billion colors and it has a 125
gkfLzA4QUQM,495440,497440,rec 709 coverage which for like a
gkfLzA4QUQM,497440,499199,projector of the size it may not have
gkfLzA4QUQM,499199,502319,features like hdr or p3 color gamut but
gkfLzA4QUQM,502319,503840,i feel like the form factor is where
gkfLzA4QUQM,503840,506319,this really shines and in dark scenarios
gkfLzA4QUQM,506319,508639,it is able to perform quite nicely you
gkfLzA4QUQM,508639,510560,just play a movie on it and you can see
gkfLzA4QUQM,510560,512880,that in a hundred inch form factor it is
gkfLzA4QUQM,512880,514320,able to give you like a pretty good
gkfLzA4QUQM,514320,516000,level of contrast which i think is one
gkfLzA4QUQM,516000,517200,of the most important things when it
gkfLzA4QUQM,517200,519120,comes to portable projectors but the
gkfLzA4QUQM,519120,520959,sharpness was decent and the color
gkfLzA4QUQM,520959,523518,accuracy was relatively good it is also
gkfLzA4QUQM,523518,525360,a completely wireless setup because you
gkfLzA4QUQM,525360,528160,can just stream via wi-fi and bluetooth
gkfLzA4QUQM,528160,529680,on top of that it also has a built-in
gkfLzA4QUQM,529680,531360,ten thousand milliamp hour battery which
gkfLzA4QUQM,531360,533360,gives you three hours of projection when
gkfLzA4QUQM,533360,535760,you're watching movies and six hours of
gkfLzA4QUQM,535760,537200,music listening which i would say is
gkfLzA4QUQM,537200,539120,pretty respectable but whenever you can
gkfLzA4QUQM,539120,540720,you do want to just keep it plugged in
gkfLzA4QUQM,540720,542240,but another thing that i also notice is
gkfLzA4QUQM,542240,544640,just how quiet the projector is when it
gkfLzA4QUQM,544640,545839,comes to some of the details of the
gkfLzA4QUQM,545839,547519,audio technology and partnership with
gkfLzA4QUQM,547519,549920,harman kardon it features dual sets of
gkfLzA4QUQM,549920,552000,tweeters and woofers as well as passive
gkfLzA4QUQM,552000,554560,radiators and it's powered by a 30 watt
gkfLzA4QUQM,554560,556560,class d amplifier harman kardon is
gkfLzA4QUQM,556560,557920,obviously a very well known brand and
gkfLzA4QUQM,557920,560000,with that audio optimization i found
gkfLzA4QUQM,560000,561440,that due to its size and everything it
gkfLzA4QUQM,561440,563040,was able to deliver as like a bluetooth
gkfLzA4QUQM,563040,565279,speaker giving you a good level of bass
gkfLzA4QUQM,565279,566959,relatively clear troubles and when it
gkfLzA4QUQM,566959,568399,comes to the home theater experience and
gkfLzA4QUQM,568399,570959,the fans that are inside a good speaker
gkfLzA4QUQM,570959,572800,is an added bonus whenever you have a
gkfLzA4QUQM,572800,574640,portable setup like this where you just
gkfLzA4QUQM,574640,576720,want to bring this and nothing else it's
gkfLzA4QUQM,576720,578240,almost like they prioritize the audio
gkfLzA4QUQM,578240,580240,side just as much as i did the video
gkfLzA4QUQM,580240,581440,when it comes to like the i o side of
gkfLzA4QUQM,581440,583040,things you do have your power control
gkfLzA4QUQM,583040,585760,the micro sd card slot an auxiliary cord
gkfLzA4QUQM,585760,588560,as well as an auxiliary out a usb for
gkfLzA4QUQM,588560,590160,charging your smartphone or something
gkfLzA4QUQM,590160,593600,there's also an ir blaster um hdmi usb
gkfLzA4QUQM,593600,596160,type c and also the dc so there's just a
gkfLzA4QUQM,596160,597920,ton of flexibility there you can connect
gkfLzA4QUQM,597920,600160,your own devices such as a game console
gkfLzA4QUQM,600160,602000,and have that on the go but i just like
gkfLzA4QUQM,602000,603360,the fact that it's all laid out very
gkfLzA4QUQM,603360,605519,nicely there's like an open front and
gkfLzA4QUQM,605519,608240,back for great 360 degree dimensional
gkfLzA4QUQM,608240,610399,speaker sound and also a lot of room for
gkfLzA4QUQM,610399,612240,it to ventilate which is why it is able
gkfLzA4QUQM,612240,614399,to perform very quietly but on top of
gkfLzA4QUQM,614399,615760,that it also has all these knurled
gkfLzA4QUQM,615760,617839,controls and buttons on the top that are
gkfLzA4QUQM,617839,619760,easy to access and when you're just
gkfLzA4QUQM,619760,621519,ready to go and pack it up you can just
gkfLzA4QUQM,621519,623600,flip the actual mirror down
gkfLzA4QUQM,623600,625600,carry it by its handle and take this
gkfLzA4QUQM,625600,627200,with you everywhere and as long as you
gkfLzA4QUQM,627200,628320,have the battery charge you can
gkfLzA4QUQM,628320,630160,technically just boot this up and start
gkfLzA4QUQM,630160,632160,using it wherever you are i also just
gkfLzA4QUQM,632160,633920,really like how durable it is because i
gkfLzA4QUQM,633920,635760,picture this being in an environment
gkfLzA4QUQM,635760,637839,where you're like camping going on a
gkfLzA4QUQM,637839,639360,road trip and you might throw this in
gkfLzA4QUQM,639360,640880,the car with all the other stuff that
gkfLzA4QUQM,640880,642640,you might have so having a setup that is
gkfLzA4QUQM,642640,644560,durable and doesn't have to be protected
gkfLzA4QUQM,644560,646640,separately is always nice so when it
gkfLzA4QUQM,646640,647839,comes to design this is definitely one
gkfLzA4QUQM,647839,649120,of the most interesting products that
gkfLzA4QUQM,649120,650880,i've checked out recently both in terms
gkfLzA4QUQM,650880,653120,of design and functionality and i think
gkfLzA4QUQM,653120,655200,it's just like a fun product overall
gkfLzA4QUQM,655200,656880,that still gives you pretty good levels
gkfLzA4QUQM,656880,660920,of performance so if you guys want
gkfLzA4QUQM,661440,662560,so if you guys remember on the channel a
gkfLzA4QUQM,662560,663920,few months ago i checked out something
gkfLzA4QUQM,663920,665680,called the whoop band and that is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,665680,667200,health product that has become quite
gkfLzA4QUQM,667200,668959,popular and it's able to give you great
gkfLzA4QUQM,668959,671120,information when it comes to your sleep
gkfLzA4QUQM,671120,673839,your hrv your general activity and just
gkfLzA4QUQM,673839,676560,insightful health data that i feel like
gkfLzA4QUQM,676560,678480,a lot of people are looking to find out
gkfLzA4QUQM,678480,680640,more of especially in the past couple
gkfLzA4QUQM,680640,683120,years and there's been a ton of options
gkfLzA4QUQM,683120,684640,on the market some of them are more
gkfLzA4QUQM,684640,686959,ergonomic others are more stylish and
gkfLzA4QUQM,686959,688560,others are more accurate and it just
gkfLzA4QUQM,688560,690240,really comes down to finding that
gkfLzA4QUQM,690240,692720,balance and even though the weap band
gkfLzA4QUQM,692720,694560,provided very good information and it
gkfLzA4QUQM,694560,696320,has been scientifically tested to have
gkfLzA4QUQM,696320,698720,quite a high accuracy one issue that i
gkfLzA4QUQM,698720,700480,kind of had with it is that i didn't
gkfLzA4QUQM,700480,701920,really like to wear it on the wrist
gkfLzA4QUQM,701920,704000,because i typically wear a watch on my
gkfLzA4QUQM,704000,706399,right hand because i'm left-handed and
gkfLzA4QUQM,706399,708320,instead i decided to wear it on my arm
gkfLzA4QUQM,708320,709600,and i just found it to be a bit
gkfLzA4QUQM,709600,711680,obstructive especially while i was
gkfLzA4QUQM,711680,714160,sleeping so one product that also came
gkfLzA4QUQM,714160,714880,out
gkfLzA4QUQM,714880,718320,recently is the aura ring generation 3
gkfLzA4QUQM,718320,720000,and this is something that i've seen
gkfLzA4QUQM,720000,722079,everywhere a lot of my friends in
gkfLzA4QUQM,722079,724560,business and in tech seemed to wear one
gkfLzA4QUQM,724560,725760,and when i went to the apple event
gkfLzA4QUQM,725760,727760,recently i noticed pretty much like a
gkfLzA4QUQM,727760,730639,huge majority of people have one as well
gkfLzA4QUQM,730639,732720,and the reason why is because it is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,732720,734880,ring it is able to fit on just so
gkfLzA4QUQM,734880,736720,seamlessly it comes in a lot of nice
gkfLzA4QUQM,736720,740160,colors including a gloss black gold
gkfLzA4QUQM,740160,742320,silver and also this like matte black
gkfLzA4QUQM,742320,744399,option right here and there's also being
gkfLzA4QUQM,744399,746639,a gucci collab which even though i'm
gkfLzA4QUQM,746639,749040,someone who like wears a gucci ring and
gkfLzA4QUQM,749040,751120,kind of likes that stuff i feel it's a
gkfLzA4QUQM,751120,753200,bit like out there or weird looking and
gkfLzA4QUQM,753200,755120,i personally think it goes very well
gkfLzA4QUQM,755120,756880,with just whatever i'm wearing in like a
gkfLzA4QUQM,756880,758560,matte black finish
gkfLzA4QUQM,758560,760160,what i like most about this is that it
gkfLzA4QUQM,760160,762639,is super light you can just put it on it
gkfLzA4QUQM,762639,764639,actually has a sizing kit that they send
gkfLzA4QUQM,764639,766079,to you and then you can really figure
gkfLzA4QUQM,766079,768720,out what your size is but it is super
gkfLzA4QUQM,768720,770800,super light and on top of that a disable
gkfLzA4QUQM,770800,772320,will give you insightful information
gkfLzA4QUQM,772320,775040,when it comes to sleep your hrv and
gkfLzA4QUQM,775040,776959,general activity as well as your
gkfLzA4QUQM,776959,778480,recovery score and as someone who
gkfLzA4QUQM,778480,780880,travels a ton i feel like that is a very
gkfLzA4QUQM,780880,782959,important set of data to have i think
gkfLzA4QUQM,782959,784240,there's three key features that i really
gkfLzA4QUQM,784240,785920,like about the aura ring one of which
gkfLzA4QUQM,785920,788240,being the fact that it knows when you
gkfLzA4QUQM,788240,790639,are like exercising for example with
gkfLzA4QUQM,790639,792320,automatic activity monitoring because a
gkfLzA4QUQM,792320,794000,lot of times i just forget to go into
gkfLzA4QUQM,794000,796320,the app and turn it on into like an
gkfLzA4QUQM,796320,798320,exercise mode but at the same time i
gkfLzA4QUQM,798320,800000,also like the sleep tracking and how
gkfLzA4QUQM,800000,801680,it's so seamless and also the fact that
gkfLzA4QUQM,801680,803760,the battery life is able to last four to
gkfLzA4QUQM,803760,806480,seven days and it's able to recharge in
gkfLzA4QUQM,806480,809120,between 20 and 80 minutes so you don't
gkfLzA4QUQM,809120,810560,really have to take it off for that long
gkfLzA4QUQM,810560,812639,to ensure that it is charged for the
gkfLzA4QUQM,812639,814560,week and that is why i like it but i do
gkfLzA4QUQM,814560,816079,know based on some of like the
gkfLzA4QUQM,816079,819120,scientific tests the accuracy itself can
gkfLzA4QUQM,819120,821360,be a bit back and forth so as i
gkfLzA4QUQM,821360,822560,mentioned one of the reasons why i
gkfLzA4QUQM,822560,825120,decided to make a cool tech series is
gkfLzA4QUQM,825120,827199,because it allows us to check things out
gkfLzA4QUQM,827199,829120,in all different categories instead of
gkfLzA4QUQM,829120,831279,being limited by price range or like
gkfLzA4QUQM,831279,833360,product realm we're able to essentially
gkfLzA4QUQM,833360,836160,check out stuff in like home tech sports
gkfLzA4QUQM,836160,838560,and also in automotive which i feel like
gkfLzA4QUQM,838560,839920,is kind of like the pinnacle of
gkfLzA4QUQM,839920,841600,technology right now it really does
gkfLzA4QUQM,841600,843120,bring together the world of like
gkfLzA4QUQM,843120,845600,artificial intelligence connected future
gkfLzA4QUQM,845600,847519,but also battery technology and
gkfLzA4QUQM,847519,850079,infrastructures around the world and
gkfLzA4QUQM,850079,851680,obviously tesla has kind of been the
gkfLzA4QUQM,851680,853760,leader of that but all these major car
gkfLzA4QUQM,853760,855760,manufacturers that have traditionally
gkfLzA4QUQM,855760,857760,been known for like their gas engine
gkfLzA4QUQM,857760,861360,cars such as mercedes porsche and audi
gkfLzA4QUQM,861360,862320,have kind of put together their
gkfLzA4QUQM,862320,865120,experience in design and luxury with a
gkfLzA4QUQM,865120,866959,fully electric car so remember we do
gkfLzA4QUQM,866959,868399,have the opportunity to check out these
gkfLzA4QUQM,868399,870560,cars i always try to take it and our
gkfLzA4QUQM,870560,872399,team was in san francisco recently to
gkfLzA4QUQM,872399,874320,have the opportunity to drive the new
gkfLzA4QUQM,874320,877120,mercedes eqs 580 and that really goes in
gkfLzA4QUQM,877120,879760,line with like the mercedes s580 review
gkfLzA4QUQM,879760,881839,that we recently did because that was
gkfLzA4QUQM,881839,883440,easily the most comfortable car that
gkfLzA4QUQM,883440,884959,i've been in um whether it's like the
gkfLzA4QUQM,884959,886800,driving experience sitting in the back
gkfLzA4QUQM,886800,888639,and the eqs 580 was kind of like the
gkfLzA4QUQM,888639,890880,futuristic model of that that has like
gkfLzA4QUQM,890880,892800,the rounded off look the screen that
gkfLzA4QUQM,892800,894880,goes all the way across the self-driving
gkfLzA4QUQM,894880,897360,capabilities and in general literally
gkfLzA4QUQM,897360,899199,looked like something out of a movie the
gkfLzA4QUQM,899199,902240,ecos 580 starts at a price of 140 000
gkfLzA4QUQM,902240,904959,and it has a equivalent of 516
gkfLzA4QUQM,904959,909040,horsepower and 631 pound-feet of torque
gkfLzA4QUQM,909040,912079,on technical terms the screen is 56
gkfLzA4QUQM,912079,914480,inches and it's a curved screen that has
gkfLzA4QUQM,914480,917199,up to three displays on that dashboard
gkfLzA4QUQM,917199,919440,when it comes to speed it has 0 to 60 of
gkfLzA4QUQM,919440,923199,4.1 seconds and a top speed of 130 miles
gkfLzA4QUQM,923199,925480,per hour as for range it can do about
gkfLzA4QUQM,925480,928240,340 miles which i would overall say is
gkfLzA4QUQM,928240,931199,pretty respectable and as i mentioned
gkfLzA4QUQM,931199,932480,this is just like the start of it
gkfLzA4QUQM,932480,934000,there's gonna be many other electric
gkfLzA4QUQM,934000,934959,cars that we're gonna have the
gkfLzA4QUQM,934959,936480,opportunity to check out and each of
gkfLzA4QUQM,936480,938639,them have like very different approaches
gkfLzA4QUQM,938639,939920,the luxury ones have obviously be
gkfLzA4QUQM,939920,941279,something that i'm interested in because
gkfLzA4QUQM,941279,943680,i love german cars the tycon was really
gkfLzA4QUQM,943680,945279,fun experience but at the same time from
gkfLzA4QUQM,945279,947360,a consumer's perspective there's also
gkfLzA4QUQM,947360,949040,some very exciting offerings that are
gkfLzA4QUQM,949040,950639,coming to the market including from
gkfLzA4QUQM,950639,952880,companies like vinfast which bring like
gkfLzA4QUQM,952880,954399,a 10 year warranty
gkfLzA4QUQM,954399,956800,to the car which for any like current
gkfLzA4QUQM,956800,958639,car in the market today is essentially
gkfLzA4QUQM,958639,960079,unheard of and with technologies of the
gkfLzA4QUQM,960079,961360,future i think we're gonna start to see
gkfLzA4QUQM,961360,963279,that a lot more often the fact that
gkfLzA4QUQM,963279,965120,electric cars and their batteries can be
gkfLzA4QUQM,965120,967920,updated improved and also enhanced via
gkfLzA4QUQM,967920,970160,software is also like a very interesting
gkfLzA4QUQM,970160,972879,idea to me
gkfLzA4QUQM,974760,976880,[Music]
gkfLzA4QUQM,976880,978079,so perhaps one of the most exciting
gkfLzA4QUQM,978079,979120,products that has showed up at the
gkfLzA4QUQM,979120,981360,office recently is apple's new setup of
gkfLzA4QUQM,981360,983199,products i know the studio display is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,983199,984800,little bit controversial and for some
gkfLzA4QUQM,984800,986560,people it's going to be a pretty good
gkfLzA4QUQM,986560,988639,value whereas for others it's going to
gkfLzA4QUQM,988639,990240,be way out of your price range and you
gkfLzA4QUQM,990240,992079,just shouldn't look at it on the other
gkfLzA4QUQM,992079,993759,hand we have the mac studio and this is
gkfLzA4QUQM,993759,995600,something that gets me really excited
gkfLzA4QUQM,995600,997040,i'm still kind of on the fence of
gkfLzA4QUQM,997040,998639,whether or not i'm going to switch over
gkfLzA4QUQM,998639,1000480,to it completely because i currently use
gkfLzA4QUQM,1000480,1002079,the mac pro and there's a lot of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1002079,1003600,different like parts inside that i'm
gkfLzA4QUQM,1003600,1004880,trying to figure out if it can work with
gkfLzA4QUQM,1004880,1006720,this workflow but it definitely makes me
gkfLzA4QUQM,1006720,1008800,excited for apple's continued future of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1008800,1011199,their own silicon and just how powerful
gkfLzA4QUQM,1011199,1013519,it actually is i could talk about this
gkfLzA4QUQM,1013519,1015600,in a whole video of its own but just
gkfLzA4QUQM,1015600,1017279,look at the computer itself it has the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1017279,1018959,option of the m1 max which is already
gkfLzA4QUQM,1018959,1021920,very powerful as well as the m1 ultra
gkfLzA4QUQM,1021920,1024000,which is essentially two m1 maxes put
gkfLzA4QUQM,1024000,1026798,together and it gives you up to 128 gigs
gkfLzA4QUQM,1026798,1029038,of unified memory on top of that it has
gkfLzA4QUQM,1029038,1031918,up to 64 cores of gpu and 20 cores of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1031918,1034160,cpu and for any video editor out there
gkfLzA4QUQM,1034160,1035678,or anyone who needs a lot of graphics
gkfLzA4QUQM,1035678,1037678,and computing performance in general it
gkfLzA4QUQM,1037678,1039839,is an absolute dream and after using it
gkfLzA4QUQM,1039839,1041520,for a little bit i can tell you that the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1041520,1043199,performance definitely lives up but a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1043199,1044798,lot of people are not going to need to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1044798,1047360,spend that high price point of the m1
gkfLzA4QUQM,1047360,1049520,ultra because the m1 max is already more
gkfLzA4QUQM,1049520,1051520,than capable some of the other features
gkfLzA4QUQM,1051520,1053600,though include the fact that the back
gkfLzA4QUQM,1053600,1056160,has four thunderbolt ports and even
gkfLzA4QUQM,1056160,1057919,though it does look like a mac mini or
gkfLzA4QUQM,1057919,1059520,nothing like special the four
gkfLzA4QUQM,1059520,1061919,thunderbolt ports all have their own bus
gkfLzA4QUQM,1061919,1063280,which is something that i can definitely
gkfLzA4QUQM,1063280,1065760,benefit from by having so many like hard
gkfLzA4QUQM,1065760,1068559,drives ssds and raid drives connected to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1068559,1070799,a computer at the same time i noticed a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1070799,1072720,lot of times on my mac pro i have an
gkfLzA4QUQM,1072720,1074480,issue with like drive speeds if there's
gkfLzA4QUQM,1074480,1076640,a ton of things connected so by having a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1076640,1078400,separate bus for each one and the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1078400,1080320,thunderbolt speeds that is definitely
gkfLzA4QUQM,1080320,1082320,huge and on top of that everything else
gkfLzA4QUQM,1082320,1084640,is very typical there's like the hdmi
gkfLzA4QUQM,1084640,1086960,you also have your usb ports and this
gkfLzA4QUQM,1086960,1089200,can support up to five displays i
gkfLzA4QUQM,1089200,1091600,believe with three or four of them being
gkfLzA4QUQM,1091600,1093120,the xcr and you can also have like an
gkfLzA4QUQM,1093120,1094960,oled tv but most of the time i would say
gkfLzA4QUQM,1094960,1096640,like two to three displays seems like
gkfLzA4QUQM,1096640,1098640,the typical setup but all in all the mac
gkfLzA4QUQM,1098640,1100320,studio has been really nice to use and
gkfLzA4QUQM,1100320,1102320,at just the fraction of the size of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1102320,1105280,apple's pro desktop it is able to beat
gkfLzA4QUQM,1105280,1107840,it in terms of power simply for what i
gkfLzA4QUQM,1107840,1109760,do i've noticed that the optimization in
gkfLzA4QUQM,1109760,1111919,both the software and the chipset has
gkfLzA4QUQM,1111919,1113120,really brought some real world
gkfLzA4QUQM,1113120,1115679,differences
gkfLzA4QUQM,1117520,1118640,when it comes to headphones one thing
gkfLzA4QUQM,1118640,1121039,that i'm always excited to check out is
gkfLzA4QUQM,1121039,1122400,products that are available
gkfLzA4QUQM,1122400,1124480,in different configuration and form
gkfLzA4QUQM,1124480,1126960,factors to suit specific needs you have
gkfLzA4QUQM,1126960,1129280,the traditional offerings such as in-ear
gkfLzA4QUQM,1129280,1131840,as well as truly wireless the over-year
gkfLzA4QUQM,1131840,1134320,and on-ear and there's also options such
gkfLzA4QUQM,1134320,1136960,as the frames which are able to give you
gkfLzA4QUQM,1136960,1139840,a sunglasses or glasses experience this
gkfLzA4QUQM,1139840,1142160,right here is the open run pro from
gkfLzA4QUQM,1142160,1144400,shocks and what i like about it is that
gkfLzA4QUQM,1144400,1146480,if you don't like to have something in
gkfLzA4QUQM,1146480,1148640,your ear while you're running around or
gkfLzA4QUQM,1148640,1150559,walking around town and don't want to be
gkfLzA4QUQM,1150559,1152000,completely disconnected from your
gkfLzA4QUQM,1152000,1153840,surroundings but also from a comfort
gkfLzA4QUQM,1153840,1156960,standpoint want more of like a off-year
gkfLzA4QUQM,1156960,1159120,experience then these bone conduction
gkfLzA4QUQM,1159120,1161760,sport headphones are a great option for
gkfLzA4QUQM,1161760,1164000,you it is essentially a one size fits
gkfLzA4QUQM,1164000,1165520,all you don't have to do any specific
gkfLzA4QUQM,1165520,1168080,adjustments for the fit you just put it
gkfLzA4QUQM,1168080,1170720,around your ear like so and it lines up
gkfLzA4QUQM,1170720,1173039,perfectly and it just feels very light
gkfLzA4QUQM,1173039,1174880,you almost forget that they're on your
gkfLzA4QUQM,1174880,1177360,ear as it wraps around it doesn't make
gkfLzA4QUQM,1177360,1178960,too much contact and at the same time
gkfLzA4QUQM,1178960,1180960,there are no pressure points so if you
gkfLzA4QUQM,1180960,1182880,decide to go for a run and still want to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1182880,1184640,enjoy what's around you but at the same
gkfLzA4QUQM,1184640,1186559,time have great audio quality and be
gkfLzA4QUQM,1186559,1188480,able to listen your music and do some
gkfLzA4QUQM,1188480,1191039,calls then this is a great solution so
gkfLzA4QUQM,1191039,1192480,for someone who is very active and
gkfLzA4QUQM,1192480,1195280,prioritizes comfort and fit over having
gkfLzA4QUQM,1195280,1197520,that noise cancelling experience and
gkfLzA4QUQM,1197520,1199360,that full seal that isolates you from
gkfLzA4QUQM,1199360,1200960,your surroundings then this is the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1200960,1203039,perfect choice so this next product is
gkfLzA4QUQM,1203039,1204400,one that actually arrived in the office
gkfLzA4QUQM,1204400,1206080,a long time ago but we're finally
gkfLzA4QUQM,1206080,1207760,getting around to setting it up and
gkfLzA4QUQM,1207760,1208960,putting it together for one of our
gkfLzA4QUQM,1208960,1211039,editors to use and that is the eve
gkfLzA4QUQM,1211039,1213440,spectrum 4k monitor and what's special
gkfLzA4QUQM,1213440,1215440,about this is that eve is a company that
gkfLzA4QUQM,1215440,1217679,has kind of pushed the boundaries of a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1217679,1219760,product that really focuses specifically
gkfLzA4QUQM,1219760,1222400,on what the consumer wants at prices
gkfLzA4QUQM,1222400,1224159,that are a lot more reasonable than some
gkfLzA4QUQM,1224159,1226240,of the other big name products on the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1226240,1228799,market that have the exact same specs
gkfLzA4QUQM,1228799,1230400,and with the eve spectrum monitor is a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1230400,1232480,27-inch monitor that comes in three
gkfLzA4QUQM,1232480,1234080,different options and it starts in the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1234080,1237280,under 500 range and goes up to 7.99 for
gkfLzA4QUQM,1237280,1238880,the flagship model that we have right
gkfLzA4QUQM,1238880,1240240,here and either have the choice between
gkfLzA4QUQM,1240240,1243039,a qhd resolution at 144 hertz max
gkfLzA4QUQM,1243039,1246799,refresh rate as well as a qhd 240 hertz
gkfLzA4QUQM,1246799,1250240,or a 4k 240 hertz which is what we have
gkfLzA4QUQM,1250240,1252880,right here and on top of that it is also
gkfLzA4QUQM,1252880,1255120,a display that is ips has a max
gkfLzA4QUQM,1255120,1256280,brightness of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1256280,1259679,750 nits as well as a one millisecond
gkfLzA4QUQM,1259679,1262080,response time that 240 hertz that we
gkfLzA4QUQM,1262080,1264799,mentioned and also nvidia g-sync support
gkfLzA4QUQM,1264799,1266880,it also does have a p3 color gamut so as
gkfLzA4QUQM,1266880,1268159,someone who does like a lot of video
gkfLzA4QUQM,1268159,1270559,editing and photo editing that is always
gkfLzA4QUQM,1270559,1272960,very useful and the max brightness is
gkfLzA4QUQM,1272960,1275120,definitely appreciated as well and at a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1275120,1277440,price of 7.99 especially if you have to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1277440,1279600,like outfit an office in these it is way
gkfLzA4QUQM,1279600,1281840,more affordable and a much better value
gkfLzA4QUQM,1281840,1283200,than something like obviously a pro
gkfLzA4QUQM,1283200,1285679,display xdr and on top of that it does
gkfLzA4QUQM,1285679,1287600,also have hdr support if that is
gkfLzA4QUQM,1287600,1288880,something that you're going to take
gkfLzA4QUQM,1288880,1291200,advantage of in gaming and also in
gkfLzA4QUQM,1291200,1293120,editing so something else that we also
gkfLzA4QUQM,1293120,1295520,picked up recently is a dji mavic 3
gkfLzA4QUQM,1295520,1297360,drone i believe it was first announced
gkfLzA4QUQM,1297360,1299120,about six months ago and to be honest
gkfLzA4QUQM,1299120,1300880,i've been away from drones for quite a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1300880,1303039,few years now i simply haven't had the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1303039,1304720,need for them but now with a team that
gkfLzA4QUQM,1304720,1306880,is capable of flying drones and with the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1306880,1309120,travel films coming back i figured it'd
gkfLzA4QUQM,1309120,1311120,be a good time to pick one up and go
gkfLzA4QUQM,1311120,1312720,ahead and integrate it into some of our
gkfLzA4QUQM,1312720,1315280,content just to add another dimension so
gkfLzA4QUQM,1315280,1317200,with the new mavic 3 it has quite a few
gkfLzA4QUQM,1317200,1319760,features that i specifically care about
gkfLzA4QUQM,1319760,1321679,when it comes to image quality for
gkfLzA4QUQM,1321679,1324240,starters the sensor is a lot larger it's
gkfLzA4QUQM,1324240,1326880,a four thirds hasselblad cmos sensor and
gkfLzA4QUQM,1326880,1328640,it's able to capture in a much better
gkfLzA4QUQM,1328640,1330320,image quality but at the same time you
gkfLzA4QUQM,1330320,1332240,have manual aperture control you can
gkfLzA4QUQM,1332240,1335039,also record in 5.1 k you have options
gkfLzA4QUQM,1335039,1337679,for pro res the 12.8 stops of dynamic
gkfLzA4QUQM,1337679,1340640,range and you can also record in d log
gkfLzA4QUQM,1340640,1342640,10 bit as someone who started grading a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1342640,1344559,lot of footage in the past couple years
gkfLzA4QUQM,1344559,1346320,it's really nice to be able to have as
gkfLzA4QUQM,1346320,1348400,much data as possible and by being able
gkfLzA4QUQM,1348400,1350400,to record at up to 200 megabits per
gkfLzA4QUQM,1350400,1352640,second in its bit rate i at least have a
gkfLzA4QUQM,1352640,1354159,good amount of latitude that when the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1354159,1356000,drone footage comes back we're able to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1356000,1357679,grade it accordingly and balancing it
gkfLzA4QUQM,1357679,1359200,out and also integrate it into the
gkfLzA4QUQM,1359200,1360960,videos with all the other cameras that
gkfLzA4QUQM,1360960,1363280,are on the ground very smoothly i think
gkfLzA4QUQM,1363280,1364960,that's always been kind of my main
gkfLzA4QUQM,1364960,1367120,priority with drones um the ease of
gkfLzA4QUQM,1367120,1369280,flight but also the image quality
gkfLzA4QUQM,1369280,1370960,elements and i always felt like there
gkfLzA4QUQM,1370960,1372720,was like a compromise between one
gkfLzA4QUQM,1372720,1374559,another back when i was really into
gkfLzA4QUQM,1374559,1376960,drones in like 2015.
gkfLzA4QUQM,1376960,1378240,on the other hand though this is still
gkfLzA4QUQM,1378240,1380080,like a very compact size it comes in at
gkfLzA4QUQM,1380080,1382559,under 900 grams in its overall weight
gkfLzA4QUQM,1382559,1384480,and the battery life is also improved to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1384480,1387440,over 45 minutes which is a huge jump
gkfLzA4QUQM,1387440,1389360,from like the 20 minutes that i used to
gkfLzA4QUQM,1389360,1391679,get on my older models i also really
gkfLzA4QUQM,1391679,1393440,like the slight update to the remote i
gkfLzA4QUQM,1393440,1395280,just feel like it's a lot easier to grip
gkfLzA4QUQM,1395280,1397039,and at the same time you still have your
gkfLzA4QUQM,1397039,1398880,phone stand here that is just a lot more
gkfLzA4QUQM,1398880,1400960,solid than before none of that folding
gkfLzA4QUQM,1400960,1402880,stuff it comes with a nice carrying case
gkfLzA4QUQM,1402880,1404559,and overall and we're definitely excited
gkfLzA4QUQM,1404559,1406159,to use this a lot more as we integrate
gkfLzA4QUQM,1406159,1408400,it into our general lifestyle and tech
gkfLzA4QUQM,1408400,1410080,content but otherwise thank you guys so
gkfLzA4QUQM,1410080,1411200,much for watching this video and if you
gkfLzA4QUQM,1411200,1412480,enjoyed it as always make sure you go

gkfLzA4QUQM,1415039,1416559,favorite item is because there's
gkfLzA4QUQM,1416559,1418320,definitely a huge variety in this
gkfLzA4QUQM,1418320,1420080,episode and i'll see you all in the next
gkfLzA4QUQM,1420080,1422660,one
