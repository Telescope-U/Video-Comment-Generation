TA_vk9EJaZU,80,2639,let's go
TA_vk9EJaZU,2990,6319,[Music]
TA_vk9EJaZU,12080,14480,is this a screenshot from the trailer i
TA_vk9EJaZU,14480,15839,don't think it is because we can
TA_vk9EJaZU,15839,18560,actually see like ui stuff about
TA_vk9EJaZU,18560,20800,clive in here it looks like your potions
TA_vk9EJaZU,20800,24080,are hot mapped to the d-pad which is
TA_vk9EJaZU,24080,26080,very action gaming you know and this
TA_vk9EJaZU,26080,28160,seems to be your style changes as well
TA_vk9EJaZU,28160,29599,as uh
TA_vk9EJaZU,29599,31519,your special attacks on each one of your
TA_vk9EJaZU,31519,32640,buttons
TA_vk9EJaZU,32640,34800,your four face buttons this is actually
TA_vk9EJaZU,34800,36160,from the trailer
TA_vk9EJaZU,36160,38079,well it looks ridiculous
TA_vk9EJaZU,38079,40800,uh yoshi peace says that one of the main
TA_vk9EJaZU,40800,43520,themes in 16 will be the clash of values
TA_vk9EJaZU,43520,46079,and ideals and now the dominance think
TA_vk9EJaZU,46079,47760,about the state of the world considering
TA_vk9EJaZU,47760,50640,the power they wield interesting
TA_vk9EJaZU,50640,51760,there's definitely gonna be some
TA_vk9EJaZU,51760,54000,backstabbing gotcha focus so much on
TA_vk9EJaZU,54000,55199,their dominance and they have such a
TA_vk9EJaZU,55199,56719,large part in the story you're gonna see
TA_vk9EJaZU,56719,58320,how they think the world should be and
TA_vk9EJaZU,58320,60000,what they think is right for the world
TA_vk9EJaZU,60000,61120,you're going to focus on these
TA_vk9EJaZU,61120,62480,motivations and the struggles and then
TA_vk9EJaZU,62480,64720,you're going to delve even deeper into
TA_vk9EJaZU,64720,66080,darker themes when it comes to how
TA_vk9EJaZU,66080,67680,people should live
TA_vk9EJaZU,67680,69520,should people live at the live the life
TA_vk9EJaZU,69520,71200,that was chosen for them or fight to
TA_vk9EJaZU,71200,74320,break free from that kind of destiny
TA_vk9EJaZU,74320,76080,damn there is no plans to have
TA_vk9EJaZU,76080,79280,supplementary material to 16.
TA_vk9EJaZU,79280,80640,uh they are working to make the game as
TA_vk9EJaZU,80640,82240,complete as possible most shockingly
TA_vk9EJaZU,82240,84479,clive will go through three stages of
TA_vk9EJaZU,84479,87200,his stages of his life his teens his 20s
TA_vk9EJaZU,87200,88880,and his 30s
TA_vk9EJaZU,88880,91439,wow okay cool
TA_vk9EJaZU,91439,95119,that's a large story right
TA_vk9EJaZU,95119,97439,there's some spoilers well
TA_vk9EJaZU,97439,99520,get ready it will not be open world
TA_vk9EJaZU,99520,101280,instead focused on
TA_vk9EJaZU,101280,103040,global scale
TA_vk9EJaZU,103040,104799,potentially a world closer to final
TA_vk9EJaZU,104799,106159,fantasy 12
TA_vk9EJaZU,106159,108159,and even final fantasy 14 have pulled
TA_vk9EJaZU,108159,110720,off 12 is actually pretty
TA_vk9EJaZU,110720,113200,meager right it's got like ff11 style
TA_vk9EJaZU,113200,115119,zones in many ways we found through
TA_vk9EJaZU,115119,116399,extensive research that many of the
TA_vk9EJaZU,116399,117600,younger generations of gamers never
TA_vk9EJaZU,117600,119200,played a final fantasy or don't have any
TA_vk9EJaZU,119200,121119,interest in the series to create a game
TA_vk9EJaZU,121119,124159,that might oh god this is so big excite
TA_vk9EJaZU,124159,125680,and resonate not only with core fans but
TA_vk9EJaZU,125680,127119,also a new generation we played a lot of
TA_vk9EJaZU,127119,129520,the game ourselves and yes in 16 you'll
TA_vk9EJaZU,129520,131680,find inspiration from recent aaa open
TA_vk9EJaZU,131680,135040,world rpgs inspiration not like you know
TA_vk9EJaZU,135040,136640,direct copying
TA_vk9EJaZU,136640,137920,to bring a story that feels like it
TA_vk9EJaZU,137920,140239,spans an entire globe and beyond we
TA_vk9EJaZU,140239,143120,decided to avoid open world as that
TA_vk9EJaZU,143120,145440,limits us to a single open world space
TA_vk9EJaZU,145440,146480,and instead of focusing on an
TA_vk9EJaZU,146480,148400,independent area based game that can
TA_vk9EJaZU,148400,150720,give players a better feel of truly
TA_vk9EJaZU,150720,152720,global scale i think i understand what
TA_vk9EJaZU,152720,154959,he means i i think i think once again
TA_vk9EJaZU,154959,156560,the issue with open world comes to like
TA_vk9EJaZU,156560,158160,a lot of traveling and stuff like that
TA_vk9EJaZU,158160,160319,that ends up being like a big part of
TA_vk9EJaZU,160319,162879,large ass open world games and maybe
TA_vk9EJaZU,162879,164480,that's not really important maybe that's
TA_vk9EJaZU,164480,166000,really not what they're looking for
TA_vk9EJaZU,166000,168080,going from biome to biome that's more
TA_vk9EJaZU,168080,169840,important instead of just like getting
TA_vk9EJaZU,169840,171680,from point a to point b and how much
TA_vk9EJaZU,171680,173519,time there is in between a lot of open
TA_vk9EJaZU,173519,174480,world stuff means there's a lot of
TA_vk9EJaZU,174480,175920,nothing happening right you're just sort
TA_vk9EJaZU,175920,177840,of driving to places or taking a chocobo
TA_vk9EJaZU,177840,179920,or whatever you essentially have to like
TA_vk9EJaZU,179920,180800,auto
TA_vk9EJaZU,180800,182720,auto chocobo from point a to point b
TA_vk9EJaZU,182720,184159,then that's not super interesting you
TA_vk9EJaZU,184159,185920,know it will have party members to
TA_vk9EJaZU,185920,188239,accompany clive but they will not be
TA_vk9EJaZU,188239,190159,playable they will still however fight
TA_vk9EJaZU,190159,191519,and talk with him we didn't want to
TA_vk9EJaZU,191519,192480,overwhelm ourselves in the newest
TA_vk9EJaZU,192480,194000,trailer so we focused slowly on clive
TA_vk9EJaZU,194000,195360,that said for most of his journey he'll
TA_vk9EJaZU,195360,197840,be accompanied by one or more companions
TA_vk9EJaZU,197840,199200,these companions will participate in
TA_vk9EJaZU,199200,202159,battle as they'll be ai driven
TA_vk9EJaZU,202159,204159,as to allow players to focus solely on
TA_vk9EJaZU,204159,205680,wow okay so you just get guest
TA_vk9EJaZU,205680,207440,characters right
TA_vk9EJaZU,207440,209200,you just have guest characters right
TA_vk9EJaZU,209200,210959,they don't they essentially act like red
TA_vk9EJaZU,210959,213120,13 did at the end of final fantasy 7
TA_vk9EJaZU,213120,216239,remake uh there's a dog
TA_vk9EJaZU,216239,217760,there's a dog
TA_vk9EJaZU,217760,219920,confirmed let's just say he's more wolf
TA_vk9EJaZU,219920,222400,than a dog his name is torgal
TA_vk9EJaZU,222400,223680,as for him being a party member you'll
TA_vk9EJaZU,223680,225440,just have to wait and see
TA_vk9EJaZU,225440,227120,oh
TA_vk9EJaZU,227120,229519,if the dog gets older with you if the
TA_vk9EJaZU,229519,231360,dog ages with you and you have to get
TA_vk9EJaZU,231360,232879,dog armor
TA_vk9EJaZU,232879,235519,oh man each icon battle will feel
TA_vk9EJaZU,235519,238000,different 3d shooting game pro wrestling
TA_vk9EJaZU,238000,240959,match battlefield what the hell
TA_vk9EJaZU,240959,245040,summon fights will be varied and crazy
TA_vk9EJaZU,245040,247120,so this is the game's giant spectacle
TA_vk9EJaZU,247120,250159,right instead of summons killing enemies
TA_vk9EJaZU,250159,252879,now summons fight summons
TA_vk9EJaZU,252879,255599,who's gonna win it's gonna be is is
TA_vk9EJaZU,255599,257040,meant to be unique and in fact we don't
TA_vk9EJaZU,257040,258880,actually use the same exact system twice
TA_vk9EJaZU,258880,260400,each battle is completely unique in its
TA_vk9EJaZU,260400,261519,play style so we're doing something
TA_vk9EJaZU,261519,263120,that's kind of crazy
TA_vk9EJaZU,263120,264880,for example one okay this might be some
TA_vk9EJaZU,264880,267360,spoilery stuff one icon versus icon you
TA_vk9EJaZU,267360,269120,have icon a versus b the bat will be
TA_vk9EJaZU,269120,271840,reminiscent of a 3d shooter so like some
TA_vk9EJaZU,271840,273520,near automata stuff
TA_vk9EJaZU,273520,275360,whereas another icon versus a different
TA_vk9EJaZU,275360,278000,icon is more like a pro wrestling match
TA_vk9EJaZU,278000,280479,um that will be the one with titan and
TA_vk9EJaZU,280479,282880,then maybe even a third one uh icon
TA_vk9EJaZU,282880,284160,versus another icon will transform an
TA_vk9EJaZU,284160,286639,entire area into a battlefield
TA_vk9EJaZU,286639,287919,and so again we didn't reuse these
TA_vk9EJaZU,287919,290000,systems for each one these icon versus
TA_vk9EJaZU,290000,291840,icon battles are unique and will change
TA_vk9EJaZU,291840,294000,with each battle that's awesome unique
TA_vk9EJaZU,294000,296560,gameplay mechanics per kaiju game
TA_vk9EJaZU,296560,298000,cool because of that and because the
TA_vk9EJaZU,298000,299199,battles are so different in nature the
TA_vk9EJaZU,299199,301039,ui has to change and so you will see
TA_vk9EJaZU,301039,302320,slight differences in the ui between
TA_vk9EJaZU,302320,304000,battles however we ended up having to
TA_vk9EJaZU,304000,306000,cut a lot of that from the trailer
TA_vk9EJaZU,306000,308080,because it ends up being story spoilers
TA_vk9EJaZU,308080,310479,makes sense right makes sense yoship
TA_vk9EJaZU,310479,312479,says that recent user research showed
TA_vk9EJaZU,312479,314800,that users felt the series was becoming
TA_vk9EJaZU,314800,316720,static in their vision which is why they
TA_vk9EJaZU,316720,318080,want to aim for something different and
TA_vk9EJaZU,318080,319280,show the series can go in different
TA_vk9EJaZU,319280,321199,directions ff's kind of famous or
TA_vk9EJaZU,321199,322479,infamous for being different from each
TA_vk9EJaZU,322479,323840,entry that said after doing some recent
TA_vk9EJaZU,323840,325039,user research fund that a lot of users
TA_vk9EJaZU,325039,326240,were finding that a lot of the recent
TA_vk9EJaZU,326240,327440,final financings are kind of becoming
TA_vk9EJaZU,327440,329280,static in the vision so we wanted to use
TA_vk9EJaZU,329280,330880,this as an opportunity to step back and
TA_vk9EJaZU,330880,332320,try something different not just for us
TA_vk9EJaZU,332320,333520,but thinking for the future and
TA_vk9EJaZU,333520,335759,forthcoming projects i mean yeah it's
TA_vk9EJaZU,335759,338240,like ff7 has been like franchised
TA_vk9EJaZU,338240,340320,practically out of final fantasy and
TA_vk9EJaZU,340320,342240,it's like it's own thing
TA_vk9EJaZU,342240,343199,so
TA_vk9EJaZU,343199,345039,that's cool i mean i think if there's
TA_vk9EJaZU,345039,346400,one person you want to trust with like
TA_vk9EJaZU,346400,347919,the vision of final fantasy this point
TA_vk9EJaZU,347919,349520,forward it's going to be yoshida you
TA_vk9EJaZU,349520,351919,know i think the fact that like 13 does
TA_vk9EJaZU,351919,354000,feel different from 15 you know that
TA_vk9EJaZU,354000,356000,does feel different from 12 but at the
TA_vk9EJaZU,356000,358639,same time those games had such
TA_vk9EJaZU,358639,362000,giant scapes of time in between them
TA_vk9EJaZU,362000,363840,that it's crazy man
TA_vk9EJaZU,363840,366240,final fantasy 12 took forever to come
TA_vk9EJaZU,366240,368639,out final fantasy 13 then took forever
TA_vk9EJaZU,368639,370800,to come out and then final fantasy xv
TA_vk9EJaZU,370800,373280,took forever to come out
TA_vk9EJaZU,373280,375840,and now at least it feels like final
TA_vk9EJaZU,375840,379039,fantasy 16 is
TA_vk9EJaZU,379039,380639,not that
TA_vk9EJaZU,380639,381840,far
TA_vk9EJaZU,381840,384400,from 15. it feels like 15 wasn't that
TA_vk9EJaZU,384400,386639,long ago right granted
TA_vk9EJaZU,386639,389759,um granted 13 and 40 yeah well 14 13 and
TA_vk9EJaZU,389759,391680,14 being the same year
TA_vk9EJaZU,391680,393360,is it really going to be seven years in
TA_vk9EJaZU,393360,395280,between ff15
TA_vk9EJaZU,395280,396639,to
TA_vk9EJaZU,396639,398479,i guess so right i guess these just
TA_vk9EJaZU,398479,400000,these games just take forever to come
TA_vk9EJaZU,400000,402080,out so by the time this comes out in
TA_vk9EJaZU,402080,404160,2023
TA_vk9EJaZU,404160,406479,yeah it came out in 2016. you're right
TA_vk9EJaZU,406479,409280,holy crap dude jeez that's crazy to
TA_vk9EJaZU,409280,411599,think i i thought i was thinking it was
TA_vk9EJaZU,411599,413840,like it was technically 2014. that's
TA_vk9EJaZU,413840,415440,crazy right that it might actually been
TA_vk9EJaZU,415440,417759,early late 2014
TA_vk9EJaZU,417759,420080,early 2015 when we were playing the the
TA_vk9EJaZU,420080,422400,demos remember like the first playable
TA_vk9EJaZU,422400,423360,demo
TA_vk9EJaZU,423360,426479,of ff15 was a hell of a long time ago so
TA_vk9EJaZU,426479,428560,new trailer focusing on the world and
TA_vk9EJaZU,428560,429840,the storyline this fall that's
TA_vk9EJaZU,429840,431759,absolutely going to be
TA_vk9EJaZU,431759,432639,uh
TA_vk9EJaZU,432639,434560,that's absolutely going to be
TA_vk9EJaZU,434560,436319,pgs i'm calling it i don't think that's
TA_vk9EJaZU,436319,437599,gamescom i think that's going to be
TA_vk9EJaZU,437599,439440,tokyo game show uh well we just released
TA_vk9EJaZU,439440,440639,a second trailer currently already
TA_vk9EJaZU,440639,441840,worked on the third trailer for release
TA_vk9EJaZU,441840,442960,and that's really we hope to concentrate
TA_vk9EJaZU,442960,444880,a bit more on the world yeah because
TA_vk9EJaZU,444880,446240,like the weird thing about the current
TA_vk9EJaZU,446240,447360,trailers for the game is that there's
TA_vk9EJaZU,447360,449199,just like a bunch of random dialogue and
TA_vk9EJaZU,449199,450880,random scenes that don't really make any
TA_vk9EJaZU,450880,454000,sense i want a trailer that focuses like
TA_vk9EJaZU,454000,456319,exclusively on some gameplay thing you
TA_vk9EJaZU,456319,459039,know like focus on like an icon fight
TA_vk9EJaZU,459039,461440,focus on clive action battles i want to
TA_vk9EJaZU,461440,464720,see what this thing i don't i don't i
TA_vk9EJaZU,464720,465919,don't know if i'm looking for story
TA_vk9EJaZU,465919,467120,stuff i just want to see what the game
TA_vk9EJaZU,467120,468879,like kind of is going to focus on the
TA_vk9EJaZU,468879,470240,world the lore and the storyline and
TA_vk9EJaZU,470240,471199,hopefully bring a bit more of that
TA_vk9EJaZU,471199,473120,information to players so the story is
TA_vk9EJaZU,473120,474720,going to be like where the narrative is
TA_vk9EJaZU,474720,476639,going okay that's good because right now
TA_vk9EJaZU,476639,478160,the the current trailers are just like
TA_vk9EJaZU,478160,479919,random dialogues and scenes where you're
TA_vk9EJaZU,479919,481520,just like what like none of this really
TA_vk9EJaZU,481520,482879,feels like it's related to the last
TA_vk9EJaZU,482879,484479,thing that was said
TA_vk9EJaZU,484479,486560,and is moving to the next thing i'm like
TA_vk9EJaZU,486560,488639,what clyde will have trusted uh a
TA_vk9EJaZU,488639,491919,trusted buddy in 16 potentially the dog
TA_vk9EJaZU,491919,493599,fighting won't be solo contrary to how
TA_vk9EJaZU,493599,494639,it appears in the trailer the main
TA_vk9EJaZU,494639,495759,character will be accompanied by several
TA_vk9EJaZU,495759,497120,ai party members which we've talked
TA_vk9EJaZU,497120,498479,about similar to past final fantasy
TA_vk9EJaZU,498479,499360,games
TA_vk9EJaZU,499360,500800,yoshida also teases that there will be a
TA_vk9EJaZU,500800,502800,faithful buddy that clive can give
TA_vk9EJaZU,502800,504800,specific commands to during combat you
TA_vk9EJaZU,504800,506720,absolutely get a dog
TA_vk9EJaZU,506720,509120,the game has a dog jessica yoship is
TA_vk9EJaZU,509120,510319,saying that the kingdom hearts team has
TA_vk9EJaZU,510319,512399,contributed to the real-time combat and
TA_vk9EJaZU,512399,515279,boss battles of ff16
TA_vk9EJaZU,515279,516880,he also confirms again that the dmc 5
TA_vk9EJaZU,516880,518320,director and dragons dogma designer is
TA_vk9EJaZU,518320,519839,involved as a combat director he
TA_vk9EJaZU,519839,521279,believes that square enix with titles
TA_vk9EJaZU,521279,524399,like ff15 and remake and the kingdom
TA_vk9EJaZU,524399,525680,heart series under its belt they finally
TA_vk9EJaZU,525680,527120,have the expertise to create a
TA_vk9EJaZU,527120,529600,compelling action combat system that
TA_vk9EJaZU,529600,531760,players regardless of their familiarity
TA_vk9EJaZU,531760,533279,with the series will enjoy well that
TA_vk9EJaZU,533279,534720,seems to have been the goal for square
TA_vk9EJaZU,534720,537279,for what feels like 15 years now
TA_vk9EJaZU,537279,538720,well that makes a lot of sense why we
TA_vk9EJaZU,538720,539920,get like a
TA_vk9EJaZU,539920,542720,hyper action mate like mainline not like
TA_vk9EJaZU,542720,544800,spin-off you know sort of
TA_vk9EJaZU,544800,546880,remake or something like that no like
TA_vk9EJaZU,546880,549920,this is the final fantasy 16 is going to
TA_vk9EJaZU,549920,551440,be even more
TA_vk9EJaZU,551440,553680,combat action focused than even ff15 and
TA_vk9EJaZU,553680,554640,that had
TA_vk9EJaZU,554640,556720,at least a decent amount but the combat
TA_vk9EJaZU,556720,558959,was always relatively wonky in 15. it
TA_vk9EJaZU,558959,560720,was cool i enjoyed it it was clear that
TA_vk9EJaZU,560720,562160,it was like a thrown together project
TA_vk9EJaZU,562160,564240,from a lot of different things and after
TA_vk9EJaZU,564240,566720,after ff15 they definitely figured a lot
TA_vk9EJaZU,566720,568160,of stuff out you're gonna have a skill
TA_vk9EJaZU,568160,570160,tree to unlock further abilities for
TA_vk9EJaZU,570160,571680,each icon he unlocks you will also be
TA_vk9EJaZU,571680,574480,able to respec and find the build that
TA_vk9EJaZU,574480,576320,oh
TA_vk9EJaZU,576320,577920,after claiming an icon's power clive is
TA_vk9EJaZU,577920,579519,able to unlock their abilities in an in
TA_vk9EJaZU,579519,581600,an ability tree and then we'll earn
TA_vk9EJaZU,581600,583120,points with regular battles that can use
TA_vk9EJaZU,583120,584320,those points to unlock at regular
TA_vk9EJaZU,584320,586240,abilities we want players to be able to
TA_vk9EJaZU,586240,587680,use the system to customize their
TA_vk9EJaZU,587680,589440,character to find their own play style
TA_vk9EJaZU,589440,590480,to use these points to purchase
TA_vk9EJaZU,590480,591519,abilities
TA_vk9EJaZU,591519,593839,that they want to use or power up and
TA_vk9EJaZU,593839,595440,they really enjoy using that said we
TA_vk9EJaZU,595440,596720,also want players to be able to decide
TA_vk9EJaZU,596720,598480,on something that really fits them and
TA_vk9EJaZU,598480,599839,rather than having those points and
TA_vk9EJaZU,599839,601600,decisions be final we're going to allow
TA_vk9EJaZU,601600,603200,players the opportunity to refund those
TA_vk9EJaZU,603200,605360,points at any time and as many times as
TA_vk9EJaZU,605360,606800,they want so they can experiment with
TA_vk9EJaZU,606800,610000,different builds this sounds crazy this
TA_vk9EJaZU,610000,612320,sounds like everyone's playthrough
TA_vk9EJaZU,612320,614240,hopefully could be different you know
TA_vk9EJaZU,614240,616240,sounds awesome is what it is it really
TA_vk9EJaZU,616240,618720,depends on how many abilities there are
TA_vk9EJaZU,618720,620240,i mean hell it's one of the it's one of
TA_vk9EJaZU,620240,621519,the things that i think makes the
TA_vk9EJaZU,621519,623519,original final fantasy vii still
TA_vk9EJaZU,623519,625360,enjoyable to this day
TA_vk9EJaZU,625360,627279,like figuring out what to do with your
TA_vk9EJaZU,627279,628480,materia
TA_vk9EJaZU,628480,630320,and who to put it on is some of the most
TA_vk9EJaZU,630320,632240,fun there is and everybody will have a
TA_vk9EJaZU,632240,634480,different technical like loadout it's
TA_vk9EJaZU,634480,636640,kind of like materia yeah
TA_vk9EJaZU,636640,639440,but really uh that's great you know
TA_vk9EJaZU,639440,640800,that's great that could lead to some
TA_vk9EJaZU,640800,643120,crazy like emergent optimal stuff where
TA_vk9EJaZU,643120,644160,people like
TA_vk9EJaZU,644160,646640,have some nutty uh gameplay mechanic
TA_vk9EJaZU,646640,648720,that collides with some other
TA_vk9EJaZU,648720,651120,nutty gameplay mechanic you know that
TA_vk9EJaZU,651120,653440,could be super cool i'm crazy down for
TA_vk9EJaZU,653440,655360,that man i think they also want to give
TA_vk9EJaZU,655360,657040,people a lot of replayability and stuff
TA_vk9EJaZU,657040,658640,like that not just play through an rpg
TA_vk9EJaZU,658640,660640,again which can be a little depending on
TA_vk9EJaZU,660640,662560,the game can sometimes be a slog yeah by
TA_vk9EJaZU,662560,664320,giving the player way more stuff to do
TA_vk9EJaZU,664320,665920,that sounds awesome all right that
TA_vk9EJaZU,665920,667680,sounds really damn cool clyde will need
TA_vk9EJaZU,667680,669600,to fight icons in both his human and
TA_vk9EJaZU,669600,671760,icon form not sure if you're only a
TA_vk9EJaZU,671760,674560,freight or you can also fight as others
TA_vk9EJaZU,674560,676560,these massive scale battles and the
TA_vk9EJaZU,676560,678720,changing of their scales from small to
TA_vk9EJaZU,678720,680560,large will play out in real time
TA_vk9EJaZU,680560,682160,connecting the action the cutscenes and
TA_vk9EJaZU,682160,683360,dialogue and story all together
TA_vk9EJaZU,683360,684720,seamlessly without any loading times
TA_vk9EJaZU,684720,686240,creating this exciting roller coaster
TA_vk9EJaZU,686240,687440,type of ride
TA_vk9EJaZU,687440,690000,and this is where potentially next gen
TA_vk9EJaZU,690000,692480,stuff starts kicking in right
TA_vk9EJaZU,692480,694640,this crazy like ambitious
TA_vk9EJaZU,694640,696959,fight starts off as like a normal human
TA_vk9EJaZU,696959,698720,fight on the ground and then naturally
TA_vk9EJaZU,698720,701519,transitions into you turning into this
TA_vk9EJaZU,701519,704800,ridiculous kaiju sized monster yes that
TA_vk9EJaZU,704800,707040,sounds that sounds ridiculously cool it
TA_vk9EJaZU,707040,708720,sounds like they're it sounds like
TA_vk9EJaZU,708720,711120,they're very action game focused and
TA_vk9EJaZU,711120,712639,they're they're trying to like push
TA_vk9EJaZU,712639,714639,everything to the biggest regard in the
TA_vk9EJaZU,714639,716240,past there existed a super over
TA_vk9EJaZU,716240,718880,technological sky civilization there was
TA_vk9EJaZU,718880,721760,a great war in the sky civilization
TA_vk9EJaZU,721760,724240,collapsed its ruins remain in many
TA_vk9EJaZU,724240,728000,places alligans well i mean chat like
TA_vk9EJaZU,728000,730000,right if we want to talk about warring
TA_vk9EJaZU,730000,732399,sky civilizations and stuff
TA_vk9EJaZU,732399,734959,no it's not from chrono trigger no it's
TA_vk9EJaZU,734959,736480,not from this it's not from that it's
TA_vk9EJaZU,736480,738480,not from the billion different things
TA_vk9EJaZU,738480,741760,that have sky civilizations
TA_vk9EJaZU,741760,743920,uh it's all from castle and the sky
TA_vk9EJaZU,743920,746399,laputa that's all from castle in the sky
TA_vk9EJaZU,746399,748720,that's where it all comes from it all
TA_vk9EJaZU,748720,751760,stems directly from laputa right the old
TA_vk9EJaZU,751760,755680,miyazaki movie from the mid 80s 1985
TA_vk9EJaZU,755680,757440,like it is
TA_vk9EJaZU,757440,760480,once again almost every jrpg big one has
TA_vk9EJaZU,760480,762880,just got that kind of stuff in it i'm
TA_vk9EJaZU,762880,764800,not surprised the simmons must be
TA_vk9EJaZU,764800,766160,freaking out right now that's like his
TA_vk9EJaZU,766160,768800,favorite movie laputa
TA_vk9EJaZU,768800,770320,clive will go through three stages in
TA_vk9EJaZU,770320,773360,his life which will follow a thorny path
TA_vk9EJaZU,773360,775440,to the end of his life
TA_vk9EJaZU,775440,776560,they will share more about this
TA_vk9EJaZU,776560,778880,character in the future jeez
TA_vk9EJaZU,778880,781440,oh jeez ai controlled characters we
TA_vk9EJaZU,781440,783040,already figured that out uh one of the
TA_vk9EJaZU,783040,785279,themes of the game is bonds between
TA_vk9EJaZU,785279,786639,people you'll have a buddy that
TA_vk9EJaZU,786639,788800,participate with clive in battle go
TA_vk9EJaZU,788800,790880,directions are full auto okay
TA_vk9EJaZU,790880,793279,most likely his dog yeah audrey said
TA_vk9EJaZU,793279,795680,that's a mistranslation okay
TA_vk9EJaZU,795680,798079,good soken came up with the idea of
TA_vk9EJaZU,798079,800480,having a choir singing the names of the
TA_vk9EJaZU,800480,802240,summons good idea
TA_vk9EJaZU,802240,803440,right
TA_vk9EJaZU,803440,806560,that's a good idea in ff6016 you will
TA_vk9EJaZU,806560,808480,have a hunt system
TA_vk9EJaZU,808480,810560,hideouts strong monsters side quests and
TA_vk9EJaZU,810560,811920,simple crafting to build weapons and
TA_vk9EJaZU,811920,813519,items you can explore
TA_vk9EJaZU,813519,815920,or be lined through the story
TA_vk9EJaZU,815920,817200,it's not an open world but there's a
TA_vk9EJaZU,817200,819040,there's about four fields of its own
TA_vk9EJaZU,819040,820560,there are also side activities taking
TA_vk9EJaZU,820560,822480,tickets for mob hunts on the bulletin
TA_vk9EJaZU,822480,825279,board which is just like ff12 stuff
TA_vk9EJaZU,825279,826480,exploring the fields in search of
TA_vk9EJaZU,826480,827680,powerful enemies and defeat and playing
TA_vk9EJaZU,827680,828720,up side quests scattered throughout the
TA_vk9EJaZU,828720,830000,fields there's also a simple crafting
TA_vk9EJaZU,830000,831040,concept that allows you to create your
TA_vk9EJaZU,831040,832160,own weapons and other items so you can
TA_vk9EJaZU,832160,833440,play while you're killing them or you
TA_vk9EJaZU,833440,834720,can play in a straight line in india and
TA_vk9EJaZU,834720,837440,go to the ending if you want wow great
TA_vk9EJaZU,837440,838240,right
TA_vk9EJaZU,838240,841279,ff-14 as well obviously but like ff12
TA_vk9EJaZU,841279,843680,was the first one to do that with hunts
TA_vk9EJaZU,843680,845199,and it was sort of based on the
TA_vk9EJaZU,845199,848000,notorious monsters that
TA_vk9EJaZU,848000,849600,uh were in final fantasy 11 because
TA_vk9EJaZU,849600,851360,there was obviously a lot of ff11 and
TA_vk9EJaZU,851360,852560,ff12
TA_vk9EJaZU,852560,854480,cool the game will have story focus mode
TA_vk9EJaZU,854480,855680,for those who are not good at action
TA_vk9EJaZU,855680,857040,games they will give accessories to help
TA_vk9EJaZU,857040,858000,you such
TA_vk9EJaZU,858000,859839,slowing time before enemy attacks oh
TA_vk9EJaZU,859839,861360,okay so there'll be a lot of like
TA_vk9EJaZU,861360,863279,assistance stuff so that you do not have
TA_vk9EJaZU,863279,865839,to a lot of um what's it called a lot of
TA_vk9EJaZU,865839,867440,accessibility options that's great
TA_vk9EJaZU,867440,869120,that's completely fine as long as
TA_vk9EJaZU,869120,871680,there's an extremely hard mode right as
TA_vk9EJaZU,871680,874639,long as there is like for action game
TA_vk9EJaZU,874639,877279,purists right just give us like the
TA_vk9EJaZU,877279,880399,thick dank like oh god to give us like
TA_vk9EJaZU,880399,882160,dark souls mode
TA_vk9EJaZU,882160,885199,or or or or add modes to the game that
TA_vk9EJaZU,885199,887199,only unlock upon defeating it the first
TA_vk9EJaZU,887199,888160,time
TA_vk9EJaZU,888160,890560,and then you can go back in oh god it
TA_vk9EJaZU,890560,892480,says it right here uh it will have a
TA_vk9EJaZU,892480,895839,hard difficulty mode after you beat
TA_vk9EJaZU,896079,898480,well this is a ridiculous amount of
TA_vk9EJaZU,898480,900480,information to go on
TA_vk9EJaZU,900480,903199,and it's it's really hard to like gather
TA_vk9EJaZU,903199,904880,everything but
TA_vk9EJaZU,904880,906959,the fact that there is
TA_vk9EJaZU,906959,910000,already such a focus on your character
TA_vk9EJaZU,910000,911920,and character action and doing stuff in
TA_vk9EJaZU,911920,913600,the world
TA_vk9EJaZU,913600,915040,it feels like the game has been
TA_vk9EJaZU,915040,917760,genuinely figured out in fact i would i
TA_vk9EJaZU,917760,918720,would be
TA_vk9EJaZU,918720,920320,long to mention
TA_vk9EJaZU,920320,922639,or bet that
TA_vk9EJaZU,922639,925120,they probably have
TA_vk9EJaZU,925120,927279,figured a lot of this out by now which
TA_vk9EJaZU,927279,930160,is why they're just dropping so much
TA_vk9EJaZU,930160,932639,information and interview oh in the ps
TA_vk9EJaZU,932639,934240,blog interview he says the game's
TA_vk9EJaZU,934240,935519,complete
TA_vk9EJaZU,935519,937120,they're just polishing now it's just
TA_vk9EJaZU,937120,938320,playable from beginning to end well
TA_vk9EJaZU,938320,940079,there you go you know we heard about
TA_vk9EJaZU,940079,941920,that a little while ago it's just that
TA_vk9EJaZU,941920,943600,it's weird that the game is still a year
TA_vk9EJaZU,943600,945360,away they're adding voices for different
TA_vk9EJaZU,945360,946959,languages well that's probably one of
TA_vk9EJaZU,946959,948000,the things that we're getting as a
TA_vk9EJaZU,948000,949519,result of the game not coming out for a
TA_vk9EJaZU,949519,951680,year you know if the game isn't coming
TA_vk9EJaZU,951680,954560,out for a year uh multilingual like
TA_vk9EJaZU,954560,956959,translation and localization is is a
TA_vk9EJaZU,956959,959600,thing that can take a very long time
TA_vk9EJaZU,959600,961440,and is probably one of the biggest
TA_vk9EJaZU,961440,963279,elements that is going into a lot of
TA_vk9EJaZU,963279,965279,that polish too i think we'll get a demo
TA_vk9EJaZU,965279,967600,i think we'll get a demo eventually
TA_vk9EJaZU,967600,969120,closer to release
TA_vk9EJaZU,969120,972759,but we'll get a demo
TA_vk9EJaZU,976850,990959,[Music]
TA_vk9EJaZU,990959,993040,you
