2J2YERCzcT0,80,2159,open a can with your bare hands
2J2YERCzcT0,2159,4880,make a pre-sliced banana and how do you
2J2YERCzcT0,4880,7359,cut a hard-boiled egg like this stay
2J2YERCzcT0,7359,9679,tuned for amazing food hacks you can
2J2YERCzcT0,9679,11519,make a really cool snack by chopping a
2J2YERCzcT0,11519,14080,hot dog sausage in half then thread one
2J2YERCzcT0,14080,16400,of the halves onto a skewer and using a
2J2YERCzcT0,16400,18240,small knife sit on the skewer at a
2J2YERCzcT0,18240,20400,slight angle and rotate the sausage to
2J2YERCzcT0,20400,22800,make a nice spiral cut all the way down
2J2YERCzcT0,22800,24800,like this when you're done stretch it
2J2YERCzcT0,24800,26880,out along the skewer
2J2YERCzcT0,26880,29519,next take some pancake mix and add a
2J2YERCzcT0,29519,31519,small amount of water so you can knead
2J2YERCzcT0,31519,34079,it into a bread like dough
2J2YERCzcT0,34079,36239,tear off a piece roll it into a long
2J2YERCzcT0,36239,38800,worm and twist it down the skewer in
2J2YERCzcT0,38800,41040,between the sausage to make a sausage
2J2YERCzcT0,41040,43440,and batter swirl
2J2YERCzcT0,43440,45440,cook them off in a frying pan with some
2J2YERCzcT0,45440,47840,oil and make sure they're cooked all the
2J2YERCzcT0,47840,50239,way around after a few minutes they're
2J2YERCzcT0,50239,52800,ready to serve pretty cool huh they
2J2YERCzcT0,52800,54719,taste great and they go really well with
2J2YERCzcT0,54719,56840,a dip you can do a similar thing with a
2J2YERCzcT0,56840,59520,potato slide it onto a skewer
2J2YERCzcT0,59520,61760,place it onto a chopping board and use a
2J2YERCzcT0,61760,64239,sharp knife to put a thin spiral cut all
2J2YERCzcT0,64239,66640,the way down to the end fan it out along
2J2YERCzcT0,66640,69040,the skewer and place it onto a baking
2J2YERCzcT0,69040,71920,tray add a little cooking oil and bake
2J2YERCzcT0,71920,74080,them in the oven they go really well
2J2YERCzcT0,74080,76640,alongside a healthy meal or to accompany
2J2YERCzcT0,76640,77759,a burger
2J2YERCzcT0,77759,79600,you can use this apple coring and
2J2YERCzcT0,79600,81840,slicing gadget to make your own potato
2J2YERCzcT0,81840,84799,wedges it's really quick and simple
2J2YERCzcT0,84799,86720,just place them on a baking tray give
2J2YERCzcT0,86720,88799,them a light coating of oil and dust
2J2YERCzcT0,88799,91280,over whatever spices you might like
2J2YERCzcT0,91280,93200,then bake them in the oven until they're
2J2YERCzcT0,93200,95759,cooked if you're also serving pizzas but
2J2YERCzcT0,95759,97439,find there's not enough space to fit
2J2YERCzcT0,97439,100240,them both in properly chop them in half
2J2YERCzcT0,100240,103280,and place them on an oven rack like this
2J2YERCzcT0,103280,105280,they should now slide neatly into your
2J2YERCzcT0,105280,107520,oven and when they're cooked you can
2J2YERCzcT0,107520,109759,slice them up as normal if you want to
2J2YERCzcT0,109759,112079,steal some pizza without anyone knowing
2J2YERCzcT0,112079,114479,you can cut it like this take a slice
2J2YERCzcT0,114479,117280,out of the middle first and remove it
2J2YERCzcT0,117280,119840,then push the two halves together
2J2YERCzcT0,119840,122079,and do exactly the same again
2J2YERCzcT0,122079,124000,then finally push all four pieces
2J2YERCzcT0,124000,125759,together and cut it as you would
2J2YERCzcT0,125759,128399,normally serve it on a plate and no one
2J2YERCzcT0,128399,130640,would ever know if you need to peel some
2J2YERCzcT0,130640,132800,garlic rather than using your hands
2J2YERCzcT0,132800,134720,which can make them smell you can just
2J2YERCzcT0,134720,136879,put the whole garlic into a saucepan
2J2YERCzcT0,136879,139200,place on the lid and hold it down firmly
2J2YERCzcT0,139200,141599,then give it a good shake after a few
2J2YERCzcT0,141599,144239,seconds the garlic breaks up and starts
2J2YERCzcT0,144239,146400,to peel the cloves shake it a little
2J2YERCzcT0,146400,149200,more and look how well it works
2J2YERCzcT0,149200,150560,if you're cooking rice and you want to
2J2YERCzcT0,150560,152879,add a little extra flavor simply add a
2J2YERCzcT0,152879,155120,vegetable stock cube as it's cooking and
2J2YERCzcT0,155120,156879,stir it in
2J2YERCzcT0,156879,158879,if you want to make some crushed ice for
2J2YERCzcT0,158879,160560,a drink put some ice cubes into a
2J2YERCzcT0,160560,161840,freezer bag
2J2YERCzcT0,161840,164160,place it onto a chopping board and give
2J2YERCzcT0,164160,166400,it a good whack with a saucepan instant
2J2YERCzcT0,166400,169200,crushed ice and perfect for a drink if
2J2YERCzcT0,169200,170879,you want to cool down a can of drink
2J2YERCzcT0,170879,173040,really quickly i'll show you how you can
2J2YERCzcT0,173040,174800,see these are at room temperature which
2J2YERCzcT0,174800,177440,are 24 degrees celsius or 75 degrees
2J2YERCzcT0,177440,179360,fahrenheit to cool them down really
2J2YERCzcT0,179360,181360,quickly we can pour a bit of water into
2J2YERCzcT0,181360,184000,a bowl then top it up with ice cubes
2J2YERCzcT0,184000,185680,next sprinkle over a couple of
2J2YERCzcT0,185680,188000,tablespoons of cooking salt give it a
2J2YERCzcT0,188000,189760,good mix
2J2YERCzcT0,189760,192319,then submerge a can
2J2YERCzcT0,192319,194959,basically adding salt causes the ice to
2J2YERCzcT0,194959,197599,melt faster but to do this it needs to
2J2YERCzcT0,197599,200319,draw heat energy from wherever possible
2J2YERCzcT0,200319,202879,in this case out of our can which causes
2J2YERCzcT0,202879,205519,the drink to rapidly cool down i gave it
2J2YERCzcT0,205519,207840,a good stir after a minute
2J2YERCzcT0,207840,209840,then after a couple of minutes i took
2J2YERCzcT0,209840,211920,the can out and let's see how the
2J2YERCzcT0,211920,213519,temperature compares to the can we
2J2YERCzcT0,213519,216000,measured earlier wow after just two
2J2YERCzcT0,216000,217920,minutes in the ice and salt water the
2J2YERCzcT0,217920,219280,temperature has dropped down
2J2YERCzcT0,219280,222319,dramatically to 5 degrees c which is 41
2J2YERCzcT0,222319,224879,degrees fahrenheit that's a huge drop in
2J2YERCzcT0,224879,226720,temperature there's only one thing we
2J2YERCzcT0,226720,229040,can say pretty cool huh if you're
2J2YERCzcT0,229040,230560,enjoying this video you might want to
2J2YERCzcT0,230560,232480,consider subscribing so you don't miss
2J2YERCzcT0,232480,234400,my future content if you want to cool
2J2YERCzcT0,234400,236400,down a glass of room temperature wine
2J2YERCzcT0,236400,238560,here's a great tip to help you you can
2J2YERCzcT0,238560,240879,keep some grapes in a ziploc freezer bag
2J2YERCzcT0,240879,243439,seal it up and keep them in the freezer
2J2YERCzcT0,243439,245040,then if you find you're pouring yourself
2J2YERCzcT0,245040,246959,a glass of room temperature wine and you
2J2YERCzcT0,246959,248720,want to cool it down quickly you can
2J2YERCzcT0,248720,251200,drop in a couple of frozen grapes these
2J2YERCzcT0,251200,252959,will act as ice cubes but it won't
2J2YERCzcT0,252959,254480,dilute your drink like it would with
2J2YERCzcT0,254480,256639,water if you give a can of baked beans a
2J2YERCzcT0,256639,258639,good shake before you open them they'll
2J2YERCzcT0,258639,260880,easily tip out into a bowl or a saucepan
2J2YERCzcT0,260880,262240,and you won't get any sticking at the
2J2YERCzcT0,262240,264560,back of the can if your can opener has
2J2YERCzcT0,264560,266400,broken and you're trying to open a can
2J2YERCzcT0,266400,268400,which hasn't got a ring pull on you
2J2YERCzcT0,268400,270479,could actually open it in an emergency
2J2YERCzcT0,270479,272639,by rubbing the seam at the top over the
2J2YERCzcT0,272639,274400,top of some sandpaper
2J2YERCzcT0,274400,276479,keep sanding and sanding until you open
2J2YERCzcT0,276479,278560,up the seam and can see the individual
2J2YERCzcT0,278560,280960,layers the lid of the can and the sides
2J2YERCzcT0,280960,282800,are no longer wrapped around each other
2J2YERCzcT0,282800,284960,wipe off any dust and you can open the
2J2YERCzcT0,284960,287919,can by just giving it a good squeeze
2J2YERCzcT0,287919,290000,with the seam sanded open the lid was
2J2YERCzcT0,290000,292000,more like a tight fitting cap pushed on
2J2YERCzcT0,292000,294960,top and another crazy hack to open a can
2J2YERCzcT0,294960,297919,is to use a spoon grip it like this hold
2J2YERCzcT0,297919,299280,on to the can
2J2YERCzcT0,299280,301039,then start rubbing the tip of the spoon
2J2YERCzcT0,301039,302880,back and forward on the top while
2J2YERCzcT0,302880,305440,pushing down to make a groove keep going
2J2YERCzcT0,305440,306960,and you should pierce a hole right
2J2YERCzcT0,306960,308880,through the top like this
2J2YERCzcT0,308880,310800,then use the edge of the spoon to cut
2J2YERCzcT0,310800,313840,all the way around the top
2J2YERCzcT0,313840,315919,keep going and when you get round far
2J2YERCzcT0,315919,318560,enough you can fold open the top
2J2YERCzcT0,318560,320720,of course opening a can like this does
2J2YERCzcT0,320720,322880,make a really sharp and jagged edge so
2J2YERCzcT0,322880,324800,you do need to be careful you can make
2J2YERCzcT0,324800,327280,an emergency food grater by drilling a
2J2YERCzcT0,327280,329360,series of holes in the side of a can
2J2YERCzcT0,329360,332000,then clean out any metal swarf use some
2J2YERCzcT0,332000,334479,pliers to snap off any burrs and give it
2J2YERCzcT0,334479,336240,a good wash
2J2YERCzcT0,336240,338160,then i used the back of the drill bit to
2J2YERCzcT0,338160,340000,bend out the holes to form a cutting
2J2YERCzcT0,340000,342479,edge like on a grater
2J2YERCzcT0,342479,344160,and it's ready to use
2J2YERCzcT0,344160,346320,i'm grating this cheese
2J2YERCzcT0,346320,347680,and it doesn't take long to have a
2J2YERCzcT0,347680,350080,decent amount
2J2YERCzcT0,350080,352000,these spiralizing gadgets are really
2J2YERCzcT0,352000,354000,cool they work really well but they are
2J2YERCzcT0,354000,356880,a little laborious to use after a while
2J2YERCzcT0,356880,358479,if you want to speed things up you can
2J2YERCzcT0,358479,360960,take a wire coat hanger and cut out a
2J2YERCzcT0,360960,363280,section like this place it into your
2J2YERCzcT0,363280,364240,drill
2J2YERCzcT0,364240,366160,and use this to turn your produce
2J2YERCzcT0,366160,368240,instead of your hands i'm pushing it
2J2YERCzcT0,368240,369759,onto the firm bit at the back of my
2J2YERCzcT0,369759,372319,courgette
2J2YERCzcT0,372319,374880,and even though it's not on straight
2J2YERCzcT0,374880,377600,look at it go it works really well
2J2YERCzcT0,377600,379440,just make sure you stop before the metal
2J2YERCzcT0,379440,381440,prongs hit the metal blade
2J2YERCzcT0,381440,384160,and it worked great with carrots too
2J2YERCzcT0,384160,385710,it really saves some time
2J2YERCzcT0,385710,388000,[Music]
2J2YERCzcT0,388000,389759,for the next one i'm taking a slice of
2J2YERCzcT0,389759,391919,white bread rolling it out nice and flat
2J2YERCzcT0,391919,394240,with a rolling pin then laying over some
2J2YERCzcT0,394240,396560,sliced cheese i'm also adding a thin
2J2YERCzcT0,396560,398400,piece of ham then starting from the
2J2YERCzcT0,398400,400400,bottom roll it all up into a nice tight
2J2YERCzcT0,400400,402240,roll like this
2J2YERCzcT0,402240,404639,and lightly fry them off in some oil
2J2YERCzcT0,404639,406319,rotate them every couple of minutes so
2J2YERCzcT0,406319,408319,they're cooked all the way around and
2J2YERCzcT0,408319,409599,when they're done we've got these
2J2YERCzcT0,409599,412560,delicious ham and cheese toasted dippers
2J2YERCzcT0,412560,414960,beautiful melted cheese
2J2YERCzcT0,414960,417759,and it goes great with guacamole
2J2YERCzcT0,417759,419840,or sour cream and chive
2J2YERCzcT0,419840,421360,if you've got a scratch on a piece of
2J2YERCzcT0,421360,423520,wooden furniture that won't polish out
2J2YERCzcT0,423520,425599,you can take a walnut and rub it back
2J2YERCzcT0,425599,428240,and forth across the scratch
2J2YERCzcT0,428240,429680,and up and down
2J2YERCzcT0,429680,431759,then give it a wipe over and it's as
2J2YERCzcT0,431759,433199,good as gone
2J2YERCzcT0,433199,434960,if you're having a barbecue you can also
2J2YERCzcT0,434960,437199,use walnuts to help light the coals
2J2YERCzcT0,437199,439120,stack a couple up together and they burn
2J2YERCzcT0,439120,441280,really well these stay delight for more
2J2YERCzcT0,441280,444000,than five minutes
2J2YERCzcT0,444000,446720,you can also use pretzels i stacked
2J2YERCzcT0,446720,448960,three up together like this and look how
2J2YERCzcT0,448960,451280,well they burn
2J2YERCzcT0,451280,453120,and we're getting a really crazy smoke
2J2YERCzcT0,453120,455120,pattern here
2J2YERCzcT0,455120,457280,or you could use doritos
2J2YERCzcT0,457280,459520,these also work really well just to make
2J2YERCzcT0,459520,462319,a small pile and light them up
2J2YERCzcT0,462319,465440,start piling the charcoal up around
2J2YERCzcT0,465440,466720,and it doesn't take long for it to
2J2YERCzcT0,466720,468240,really get going
2J2YERCzcT0,468240,469840,if you want to make a burger with a bit
2J2YERCzcT0,469840,471680,of a difference you can use a drinking
2J2YERCzcT0,471680,474080,glass to cut a hole out of the center
2J2YERCzcT0,474080,475919,then while it's cooking crack an egg
2J2YERCzcT0,475919,478080,inside
2J2YERCzcT0,478080,480319,make sure it's cooked on both sides i'm
2J2YERCzcT0,480319,482160,also adding cheese
2J2YERCzcT0,482160,484479,and there we have an amazing burger cut
2J2YERCzcT0,484479,486160,it in half and you can see the egg
2J2YERCzcT0,486160,487280,inside
2J2YERCzcT0,487280,489199,a muffin tray is a great way to serve
2J2YERCzcT0,489199,491520,sauces and dips at your barbecue and you
2J2YERCzcT0,491520,493280,can even add small salad pieces for your
2J2YERCzcT0,493280,496319,burger like cucumbers and tomatoes you
2J2YERCzcT0,496319,498240,can use teaspoons to help make a nice
2J2YERCzcT0,498240,500400,frozen yogurt snack make a slit in the
2J2YERCzcT0,500400,502800,center of your yoga pot lid then push
2J2YERCzcT0,502800,504560,through a teaspoon the lid will help to
2J2YERCzcT0,504560,507039,keep it centralized and upright i did
2J2YERCzcT0,507039,508960,this with all six then placed it in the
2J2YERCzcT0,508960,511039,freezer the following day they're frozen
2J2YERCzcT0,511039,513919,solid and ready to eat just snap one off
2J2YERCzcT0,513919,516159,and peel off the lid
2J2YERCzcT0,516159,517440,and you can put the rest back in the
2J2YERCzcT0,517440,519039,freezer for later
2J2YERCzcT0,519039,520719,if you've got a pack of lollipop sticks
2J2YERCzcT0,520719,522479,you can of course use these instead of
2J2YERCzcT0,522479,524640,teaspoons i'm using them to make these
2J2YERCzcT0,524640,527120,mini ones if you find your popsicle or
2J2YERCzcT0,527120,528880,lollipop starts melting before you
2J2YERCzcT0,528880,530720,finished it which often happens with
2J2YERCzcT0,530720,532800,small children you can take a cupcake
2J2YERCzcT0,532800,535519,paper make a small slice in the bottom
2J2YERCzcT0,535519,537440,and slide it over the stick to act as a
2J2YERCzcT0,537440,540240,drip tray and stop those sticky fingers
2J2YERCzcT0,540240,541760,and you can also use it on the frozen
2J2YERCzcT0,541760,544480,yogurts we made earlier too
2J2YERCzcT0,544480,545760,next i'm going to show you how to make
2J2YERCzcT0,545760,549040,this amazing pre-sliced banana
2J2YERCzcT0,549040,550399,to make it we're going to need to use a
2J2YERCzcT0,550399,551920,needle or pin
2J2YERCzcT0,551920,554480,then take your banana and choose one of
2J2YERCzcT0,554480,556800,these lines to work on use your needle
2J2YERCzcT0,556800,558640,and poke all the way into the fruit but
2J2YERCzcT0,558640,560240,don't come out to the other side then
2J2YERCzcT0,560240,562080,move it back and forth left and right
2J2YERCzcT0,562080,564080,like this this is actually slicing the
2J2YERCzcT0,564080,566080,fruit underneath the skin when you're
2J2YERCzcT0,566080,568080,done move the needle down a little and
2J2YERCzcT0,568080,570320,do exactly the same again
2J2YERCzcT0,570320,572000,work your way down the whole banana and
2J2YERCzcT0,572000,573200,you should have something that looks
2J2YERCzcT0,573200,575600,like this you can actually just see the
2J2YERCzcT0,575600,577760,holes so when you show it to someone
2J2YERCzcT0,577760,579760,turn it around and hide them then it's
2J2YERCzcT0,579760,581760,ready to peel open it up in front of
2J2YERCzcT0,581760,583680,someone and they'll be amazed by your
2J2YERCzcT0,583680,586160,pre-sliced banana another way to slice a
2J2YERCzcT0,586160,588240,banana is using a metal cooling rack
2J2YERCzcT0,588240,589519,like this
2J2YERCzcT0,589519,592160,sit on top of a bowl then take a banana
2J2YERCzcT0,592160,595200,and carefully peel half of it
2J2YERCzcT0,595200,597120,we want to leave the skin on one half
2J2YERCzcT0,597120,598399,like this
2J2YERCzcT0,598399,600320,then place it on top of the cooling rack
2J2YERCzcT0,600320,602240,and carefully push it through from one
2J2YERCzcT0,602240,604079,end up to the other if we look from
2J2YERCzcT0,604079,606320,underneath you can see what happens as
2J2YERCzcT0,606320,608480,we push it through it neatly slices the
2J2YERCzcT0,608480,611040,banana and it falls into the bowl it's a
2J2YERCzcT0,611040,612560,really handy technique if you need to
2J2YERCzcT0,612560,615120,slice a lot of bananas in one go it's
2J2YERCzcT0,615120,616959,nice and quick and safer than using a
2J2YERCzcT0,616959,618800,knife perfect if you're making a nice
2J2YERCzcT0,618800,620880,big fruit salad or something and it also
2J2YERCzcT0,620880,622800,works well on other soft fruit like
2J2YERCzcT0,622800,624880,avocado cut it in half and remove the
2J2YERCzcT0,624880,626959,stone and this time i'm using a cooling
2J2YERCzcT0,626959,629440,rack with square holes mash it through
2J2YERCzcT0,629440,631360,and there we go perfect if you're making
2J2YERCzcT0,631360,632640,guacamole
2J2YERCzcT0,632640,634160,if you've got an avocado which isn't
2J2YERCzcT0,634160,635760,quite soft yet and you want to help
2J2YERCzcT0,635760,637760,speed up the ripening process you can
2J2YERCzcT0,637760,640079,take some tin foil and wrap the avocado
2J2YERCzcT0,640079,641200,up in it
2J2YERCzcT0,641200,643200,then put it into an oven dish and place
2J2YERCzcT0,643200,645120,it in the oven at about 200 degrees
2J2YERCzcT0,645120,647279,fahrenheit that's about 90 degrees
2J2YERCzcT0,647279,650000,celsius warming the avocado up gently
2J2YERCzcT0,650000,652160,releases gas which surrounds it and
2J2YERCzcT0,652160,654160,helps speed up the ripening process
2J2YERCzcT0,654160,656560,after about 10 minutes take it out place
2J2YERCzcT0,656560,658240,it on a cooling rack and leave it to
2J2YERCzcT0,658240,660320,completely cool down once it's cooled
2J2YERCzcT0,660320,662480,down remove the foil and it's ready to
2J2YERCzcT0,662480,665200,eat cut it in half remove the stone and
2J2YERCzcT0,665200,667279,you should now find it soft ripe and
2J2YERCzcT0,667279,670079,perfect for eating
2J2YERCzcT0,670079,671920,if you're cooking hard-boiled eggs when
2J2YERCzcT0,671920,673440,they're ready you can tip out the hot
2J2YERCzcT0,673440,676160,water and cool them down with cold then
2J2YERCzcT0,676160,678720,fill the pan up about halfway and put on
2J2YERCzcT0,678720,681200,the lid hold it on really firmly and
2J2YERCzcT0,681200,683360,give the pan a good shake
2J2YERCzcT0,683360,684959,when you take the lid off you can see
2J2YERCzcT0,684959,687440,the eggs are half peeled and the rest of
2J2YERCzcT0,687440,689440,the shell removes really easily by just
2J2YERCzcT0,689440,691760,brushing it off with your thumbs
2J2YERCzcT0,691760,693040,next i'm going to show you how to do
2J2YERCzcT0,693040,695440,this really cool egg hack
2J2YERCzcT0,695440,697519,take a drinking straw and use a pair of
2J2YERCzcT0,697519,700160,scissors to cut the ends like this fold
2J2YERCzcT0,700160,702320,it in half so it makes a v shape like
2J2YERCzcT0,702320,705040,this take your egg and insert the straw
2J2YERCzcT0,705040,707440,so it makes a cut pull it out and keep
2J2YERCzcT0,707440,709839,going round so it makes a zigzag cut all
2J2YERCzcT0,709839,711440,the way around the egg once you've
2J2YERCzcT0,711440,713200,finished you should be able to lift it
2J2YERCzcT0,713200,716240,off and reveal the yolk and it looks
2J2YERCzcT0,716240,717440,really cool
2J2YERCzcT0,717440,719600,and depending where and how big the oak
2J2YERCzcT0,719600,721920,is inside the egg you'll find you get a
2J2YERCzcT0,721920,723839,completely different outcome
2J2YERCzcT0,723839,725839,you can use a fruit juice container to
2J2YERCzcT0,725839,727760,make a heart-shaped egg peel a
2J2YERCzcT0,727760,729920,hard-boiled egg then sit it on top of
2J2YERCzcT0,729920,731600,the fruit juice container that we cut
2J2YERCzcT0,731600,733760,out so it looks like this next take a
2J2YERCzcT0,733760,736240,chopstick and use some elastic bands at
2J2YERCzcT0,736240,738480,each end to hold it in place this is now
2J2YERCzcT0,738480,740240,pulling down and forming a dip at the
2J2YERCzcT0,740240,741920,top of the egg and a v-shape at the
2J2YERCzcT0,741920,743839,bottom leave it to sit in the fridge for
2J2YERCzcT0,743839,746560,an hour or two then undo it and it looks
2J2YERCzcT0,746560,748639,like this
2J2YERCzcT0,748639,750560,and when we cut it in half you get this
2J2YERCzcT0,750560,753040,amazing heart-shaped egg perfect to
2J2YERCzcT0,753040,754720,serve up with a salad
2J2YERCzcT0,754720,756320,if you want some fresh butter but you
2J2YERCzcT0,756320,757760,didn't take it out of the fridge in time
2J2YERCzcT0,757760,759839,it can be hard and really difficult to
2J2YERCzcT0,759839,762320,spread it can just rip your bread and
2J2YERCzcT0,762320,764160,make a bit of a mess if you try putting
2J2YERCzcT0,764160,765839,it in a microwave you have to be very
2J2YERCzcT0,765839,767760,very careful or you might end up with
2J2YERCzcT0,767760,769920,just a big plate of fat like this but
2J2YERCzcT0,769920,772240,what you can do is take a drinking glass
2J2YERCzcT0,772240,774240,fill it with some really warm water and
2J2YERCzcT0,774240,776000,let it stand for a minute to heat up the
2J2YERCzcT0,776000,778399,glass then empty it out and dry the
2J2YERCzcT0,778399,780480,glass and place it upside down over the
2J2YERCzcT0,780480,782320,butter leave it there for a few minutes
2J2YERCzcT0,782320,784000,so the heat from the glass radiates
2J2YERCzcT0,784000,786639,around the butter and gently heats it up
2J2YERCzcT0,786639,788240,and the butter should now be ready to
2J2YERCzcT0,788240,790079,spread it picks up on the knife a lot
2J2YERCzcT0,790079,791760,easier and although it's not quite
2J2YERCzcT0,791760,793760,perfect it is a lot easier if you're
2J2YERCzcT0,793760,795360,making some pastry but you haven't got a
2J2YERCzcT0,795360,797279,rolling pin you can use a glass bottle
2J2YERCzcT0,797279,799200,instead i've taken the label off and i'm
2J2YERCzcT0,799200,800959,giving it a dusting of flour to stop it
2J2YERCzcT0,800959,802880,from sticking
2J2YERCzcT0,802880,805279,but it works really well
2J2YERCzcT0,805279,807200,and a wine glass makes an excellent
2J2YERCzcT0,807200,809279,cookie cutter
2J2YERCzcT0,809279,810800,and if you need to roll something to a
2J2YERCzcT0,810800,812720,thin uniform thickness you can use a
2J2YERCzcT0,812720,814880,couple of kebab skewers to help place
2J2YERCzcT0,814880,816720,your dough in the middle and roll it out
2J2YERCzcT0,816720,819440,like this the skewers act as a spacer
2J2YERCzcT0,819440,821199,giving you a beautiful flat uniform
2J2YERCzcT0,821199,823360,layer of dough you can use a cupcake
2J2YERCzcT0,823360,825440,tray like this to make amazing cookie
2J2YERCzcT0,825440,828079,dough bowls using some butter grease up
2J2YERCzcT0,828079,830240,individual molds like this we're not
2J2YERCzcT0,830240,831519,going to do every one because the
2J2YERCzcT0,831519,833360,mixture will spread as it bakes and we
2J2YERCzcT0,833360,835440,don't want it to all stick together next
2J2YERCzcT0,835440,837199,take a handful of cookie dough and
2J2YERCzcT0,837199,839040,spread it over the back of the tray like
2J2YERCzcT0,839040,840079,this
2J2YERCzcT0,840079,842720,i'm doing six all together
2J2YERCzcT0,842720,845040,then bake in the oven as normal
2J2YERCzcT0,845040,846800,when they're ready take them out and let
2J2YERCzcT0,846800,848639,them cool for a few minutes
2J2YERCzcT0,848639,850560,then pop one off the tray and there we
2J2YERCzcT0,850560,853040,have a cookie dough bowl delicious to
2J2YERCzcT0,853040,855120,serve with ice cream and maybe some
2J2YERCzcT0,855120,856480,chocolate sauce
2J2YERCzcT0,856480,857920,now i'm going to show you a really cool
2J2YERCzcT0,857920,859680,trick for whipping cream if you're
2J2YERCzcT0,859680,861760,pouring it into a bowl and using a whisk
2J2YERCzcT0,861760,863360,it can take a really long time and it's
2J2YERCzcT0,863360,866160,difficult if you're doing small amounts
2J2YERCzcT0,866160,867920,so instead you can take a clean glass
2J2YERCzcT0,867920,870160,jar and pour the cream into there leave
2J2YERCzcT0,870160,871920,a bit of space at the top and if you
2J2YERCzcT0,871920,873600,like you can sweeten it with a spoon of
2J2YERCzcT0,873600,875680,sugar then screw the lids tightly onto
2J2YERCzcT0,875680,878000,the jar and give it a good shake keep
2J2YERCzcT0,878000,880480,shaking and shaking and shaking and
2J2YERCzcT0,880480,881839,after a few minutes you'll have made
2J2YERCzcT0,881839,884480,delicious perfectly whipped cream it
2J2YERCzcT0,884480,886399,tastes delicious and is perfect for
2J2YERCzcT0,886399,888480,serving with your dessert or even in a
2J2YERCzcT0,888480,890480,coffee and because it's already in a
2J2YERCzcT0,890480,892240,screw top jar you can just put the lid
2J2YERCzcT0,892240,894079,on and store it in the fridge you can
2J2YERCzcT0,894079,895839,make a really nice dessert by cutting
2J2YERCzcT0,895839,898160,the top off an apple then use a spoon to
2J2YERCzcT0,898160,900240,hollow it out like this leave the side
2J2YERCzcT0,900240,902399,wall about a centimetre thick next i'm
2J2YERCzcT0,902399,904000,filling mine with some stewed apple
2J2YERCzcT0,904000,905680,which i made earlier
2J2YERCzcT0,905680,907600,then finishing it with an oaty crumble
2J2YERCzcT0,907600,909519,topping
2J2YERCzcT0,909519,911680,place it on a baking tray and i'm making
2J2YERCzcT0,911680,913519,four all together then put them in the
2J2YERCzcT0,913519,915760,oven and leave them to bake
2J2YERCzcT0,915760,917279,when they're ready take them out and
2J2YERCzcT0,917279,919199,we've got these amazing apple crumble
2J2YERCzcT0,919199,921279,apples they go really well with ice
2J2YERCzcT0,921279,923519,cream or the cream we just whipped
2J2YERCzcT0,923519,925040,if you're having a slice of dessert and
2J2YERCzcT0,925040,926800,you want to decorate it you can use a
2J2YERCzcT0,926800,928720,vegetable peeler to make some beautiful
2J2YERCzcT0,928720,930560,chocolate shavings
2J2YERCzcT0,930560,932399,or take a slab of chocolate and using a
2J2YERCzcT0,932399,934720,knife blade carefully shave the back of
2J2YERCzcT0,934720,936639,the chocolate like this to make these
