RGHNUE9Z3xI,2083,9041,Hey there athletic sporting contest fans.  How many times have you missed the big game
RGHNUE9Z3xI,9041,14041,because of a tortilla chip injury?  Too many times to remember.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,17208,24708,"Put away your safety goggles because chips with sharp corners  are now a thing of the past, thanks to... the Tor-trimma!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,29791,35458,It smells like... burnt plastic.  The smell of snack safety...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,38833,44000,Turn it off! Turn it off!  I’m trying!  Try harder!  Tom!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,44166,46500,Noooo!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,50875,57083,"I guess I need to re-calibrate the hypotenuse-finder...  Hey guys.  Thanks, Angela! You saved our- oooh!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,57625,65125,"What? What’s wrong?  Tom, look away. You don’t want to see this.  What? I don’t see what the... Ow, my eyes."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,65125,71708,"Is that a Piranhas shirt? Tell me that’s not a Pir...  Ow, it’s a Piranhas shirt.  Huh? Oh, this?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,72166,78000,What’s the big deal? The Piranhas are just a basketball team.  Seeing you in that shirt cuts.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,78000,83500,"It cuts like a corny tortilla chip to the gums.  Ben, help me out here..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,83833,90000,The Piranhas are in the championship game against our favorite team -  the Barracudas...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,90166,96583,"Well, see, there you go.  Piranhas, Barracudas, you can see why I got confused,  they’re like practically the same thing."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,97250,102541,The same?  Barracudas are honest saltwater ambush predators.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,102541,108250,And Piranhas they are nothing but freshwater cheaters who play dirty  and hunt their prey in schools.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,108250,116666,"Oh, okay. I get it.  To prove I’m a Barracuda’s fan like you guys...  I will never wear this disgusting, cheating team’s shirt again!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,117666,120791,"Well, thank you for understanding, Angela.  Yes. It’s for the best."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,135916,144000,Stupid basketball game...  Why do they have two teams named after fish anyways?  Barracudas are honest saltwater ambush predators.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,144000,149000,"And Piranhas are -  Oh no, is that... Victoria Payne?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,149291,154458,I give Angela a thumbs down. Down. Down.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,154958,162750,"Hello, Victoria.  Angela?  I haven’t seen you since you totally tore me apart in that - song."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,162958,167375,"Payne can’t hurt me.  You see, it’s her name."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,168000,178791,"Well, if it seemed too mean, just remember, you started it -  did it seem too mean?  When you sang, “Payne can’t hurt me,” it was like you were calling me a pain."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,178791,184458,"Oh my fosh, I’m really sorry.  The thing is I was just so mad when I wrote it."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,184458,190250,"Ha! Oh my god.  Just kidding, of course.  That’s the first song of yours I actually like - liked."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,190250,196625,"Really? Well then, what did you like about it?  Oh. Well, it was real.  You know it showed that under all the rainbows"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,196625,203458,"and sunshine there’s some... grit.  I have grit... Yay!  Wait, you like the Piranhas?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,203458,210290,"Oh, this is just a shirt...  Eyes up here.  ...that I wear because I love the Piranhas."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,210291,217625,"“Chomp n’ stomp,” right?!  “Chomp n’ stomp!”, yeah.  Wow, you know, you may not be a total waste of time."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,217750,223415,"Hey, how about we forget about the past and start over?  Okay... Victoria."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,223416,230083,"Oh, I just hope there’s room for us in the Diner.  The Diner?  Maybe I was too harsh on Angela for wearing the enemy’s shirt."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,230125,236791,"It was an innocent mistake. It’s not like she’s a Piranhas fan.  But to make sure it doesn’t happen again, I’m giving her"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,236791,243583,"this to wear while we watch the game.  - What’s that in the water, ya’ll?! - Piranhas!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,243916,251291,"- And who are we gonna feed on tomorrow?! - The Barracudas!  Wow, Piranhas fans really know how to have fun!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,251583,257040,"Yeah we do!  Hey, I just thought of a great story  for the Thumbs Up Thumbs Down Report."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,257040,263541,"Angela and Victoria.  Two powerful women in the local music scene -  Ooh, I like that part..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,263541,270666,"Ooh, I better take this. B-R-B.  Yo, it’s local pop star, Angela!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,270666,274541,"Make some noise, Piranhas fans!  Let’s show her some love."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,276541,288250,"Wow. Thanks.  Now, tell us why you love the Piranhas - Go.  Oh. Um, because they’re the best at running and bouncing the ball really fast..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,290083,298666,Oh! Oh! And they hunt their prey in schools!  Unlike those Barracudas who are nothing but a bunch of saltwater
RGHNUE9Z3xI,298666,305875,ambush-predator cheaters! Am I right?!  Yey everyone! Woo-hoo... sports!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,305875,310916,Oh yeah!  Now that’s a fan who really knows her stuff!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,311000,317082,You are not going to believe this.  That was the owner of the Piranhas on the phone.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,317083,322208,"I told him what a huge Piranhas fan you are.  And I of course said that if he knows anything about good music,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,322208,327541,"he should hire Angela, obviously.  ...and?  And you got the job!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,327541,332291,You are the Piranhas’ halftime entertainment at tomorrow’s championship game.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,332791,339041,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Here, you can have this.  It will look great on stage with your Piranhas shirt!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,339041,343750,I love it!  This is going to be so much fun!  I can’t wait to tell Tom and -
RGHNUE9Z3xI,344125,347416,Oh... Oh sports.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,361041,368457,"Uh. Ben, can you please hurry up with that so we can make breakfast?  I just need to adjust the angle reader from “obtuse” to “acute.”"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,368708,375833,"There’s nothing cute about missing breakfast, Ben.  My stomach is eating itself.  There, that should do it. Let’s give it a try."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,376833,379375,What’s wrong with you.  You should be trimming tortillas.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,383750,390207,Hey guys. I have donuts.  Did she say doughnuts?  - No sharp edges. - You saved our lives.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,392208,394500,"Easy, guys. Save some for the game."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,397500,404208,"You know, Tom.  You and the guys don’t have to worry about those  dangerous snacks anymore, because you’ll be watching"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,404208,408000,the game live and in person. Boom.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,409833,415207,You got us tickets?  Yes. I did.  Angela! Angela! Angela!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,415208,421208,How did you get these?  The game’s been sold out for weeks.  It’s actually a funny story...  Remember Victoria Payne?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,421208,428291,"Yeah, well it turns out she knows someone who knows someone,  and they asked me to perform at halftime."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,428291,435083,"Crazy, right?  You’re the halftime entertainment?!  Yes! I get to sing in the middle of the game while the players"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,435083,440582,drink water and get yelled at.  Wow. This is huge.  The whole town will be watching the game.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,440583,446500,"After today, everyone will know your name.  I’m really glad you guys understand what a great career opportunity"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,446500,451000,"this is for me. Because um, well the thing is, I was hired by the P-"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,453291,459541,"Right, these are so dangerous.  Here, I was gonna give this to you later but -"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,459541,466583,"but it looks like I better give it to you now.  Oh, um...  You can wear it tonight so everyone knows you’re rooting for the good guys."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,466583,473375,"“Good guys,” oh, come on.  I mean. Can’t we just focus on what a great  career opportunity this is for me?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,473583,479875,"I mean it’s just a stupid basketball game.  Not to us, Angela. Not to us."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,486208,491375,"You are a traitor, Angela.  No, Tom!  Yes, Angela, you betrayed us."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,491375,506625,What? No!  Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,507250,509833,Nooo!!!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,520333,525541,"Well, well, well. Victoria Payne is a Piranhas Fan.  Doesn’t surprise me."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,525541,531916,"Ooh. Quick question which hurts more, getting chomped or getting stomped?  We’ll see who chomped and stomped who when the game’s over."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,531916,538083,"And Piranhas don’t have feet, Victoria.  Ladies and gentlemen, please give a round of applause to tonight’s"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,538083,541791,"halftime performer, Angela!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,547041,554083,"Hey, everyone. Here’s a song I wrote especially for tonight.  It’s called No One Wins And No One Loses."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,555666,561208,"I sure hope you like it... Hit it!  Everyone in the house who doesn’t care who wins tonight,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,561208,566000,put your hands up like this! Com’on!  Woo-hoo!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,566583,571875,Me and myself.  What is she doing?  Let’s all hope it’s a tie / Yeah a tie/
RGHNUE9Z3xI,572458,578958,"Let’s hope no one wins, and no one loses /  so everyone can go home... Hey!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,582333,585875,"Hey, quit throwing stuff! Seriously, it's one more -"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,590416,598125,"Angela, what were you thinking?  Uh, dur-doy what the heck!  I just wanted people to get along instead of fighting over who’s"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,598125,604000,going to win the stupid game...  But now that I think about it I really didn’t realize how much  people hate a tie game.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,604000,610166,"Or a song about a tie game.  Big mistake.  Yeah, that song was... not good.  And by not good, he means terrible."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,610166,615791,"I agree. The worst...  Okay, yeah, got it, thanks. But, wait a second."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,615791,621875,Look at all you right now.  I see Piranhas fans and Barracudas fans... and you are all putting aside your
RGHNUE9Z3xI,621875,626958,differences and agreeing on something.  And it’s all thanks to my song!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,626958,628750,I call that progress!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,637833,645083,"Victoria, just how bad is this for my career?  Give it to me straight.  Maybe don’t watch this week’s Thumbs-up, Thumbs-down Report."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,645083,652375,"Oh, right.  Oh man, this is the most exciting game of"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,652375,659250,"“Home Improvers” ever. What should I do, what should I do?  What? You should take your turn."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,659250,665833,"Actually, you should have taken your turn 20 minutes ago...  Seriously, Hank. Either pick a card or drop a nail in the bucket."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,665833,675208,Uh. Yes! I get to put a roof on my gazebo! Now do I go  oxidized copper or straw? Hmm... what will I do?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,675208,681750,"Will you go already?!  Incoming!  Watch the gazebo, gazebro."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,683083,690750,Since when do you play tennis?  My parents said I have too much energy so they signed me up for  the eight-and-under championship. Where is my ball?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,693166,699291,"Hey, not cool!  Ginger! You destroyed Tom’s above-ground pool!  Sorry, not sorry!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,699291,707125,"Oh no! Looks like I’m out. But tell you what, I’ll go play tennis with  Ginger so you guys can just finish this game without any"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,707125,710750,"more interruptions, okay? No, no... I insist."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,728916,736333,"Darn it! This game cheats!  Whoa, take it easy, Ginger.  I can’t take it easy! I want to win"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,736333,741791,"the eight-and-under tournament!  Ginger, do you know why I always win at everything I do?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,741791,752333,"Because you cheat?  Yes, because I...what...wait, no, no, it’s because I always make  sure, no matter what, to take a moment to smile and enjoy myself."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,758791,761916,Home run!  It’s outta here!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,765416,771875,"Hey, someone want to tell me what’s going on here?  Uh. I am helping Ginger prep for a tennis tournament."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,772666,780791,"Wrong! What you’re doing is called goofing around!  We’re just having fun!  Fun? Youth tennis tournaments aren’t about having fun, Tom..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,780791,786583,"I learned that the hard way...  Who are you looking at?  Shh, Flashback."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,786583,796791,"What’s a flashback?  Shh!  Time for the eight-and- under final, y’all! Angela"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,796791,804375,"Who-hoo, let’s hear it for tennis!  versus Tatiana! This should be all that and a bag of chips."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,804375,812333,"And no matter what happens, you can’t say Angela didn’t have fun!  Hi everyone, guess what, I thought of a tennis song!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,814958,824791,Over the net / Into the square /  Over the rainbow / And into your heart/
RGHNUE9Z3xI,825166,831625,Tennis is a gaaaaame for fuuuun!  Yeah! Alright! Woohoo!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,831625,839250,"I fifteen love this crowd! Ow!  That’s game, set, match, Tatiana, everyone."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,839625,847375,"But wait, I’m still doing my song you guys.  Congrizz-natulations, Tatiana!... Instead of a trophy, we got you..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,847416,856500,"a magical pegasus pony!  Come fly with me, Tatiana. You shall be our queen."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,856500,861750,"Oh, by the way, he talks!  Talking...Unicorn..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,864333,872000,Tatiana grew up to become queen of the enchanted  land of ponies. All because I wasn’t focused on winning.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,872000,877541,"Oh, come on. None of that happened!  Oh, really, then how do you explain this?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,879666,884541,"Ever since that day I lost, not one thing has gone right for me..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,885833,893458,"Ginger, Aloha!  Darren!  You’re practicing for the eight-and-unders? I don’t"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,893458,899833,"even know why you’d bother. Everyone knows I’m going to win!  Get out of here, Darren!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,899833,906083,"Oh, I’ll go.  I’ll go back to my castle-mansion  that has 50 tennis courts."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,907833,909125,Nice shot!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,914375,921250,"Ginger, you have got to beat that brat.  Winning...  No he doesn’t. Yes, Darren’s obnoxious. But who cares"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,921250,926333,if Ginger beats him? He’s playing in an eight-  and under tennis tournament. All that matters is that he has fun.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,926333,932458,But -  No! Fun never got anyone anywhere!  Oh yeah? Why do you think I always come up  with incredible inventions?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,932458,938500,"Why do you think everyone loves me?  Why do you think people see me and say,  “Man, I wish I was that guy!”"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,938500,943875,Because I always have FUN. F-U-N. Fun.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,943875,951458,"Ginger, I am going to coach you. It’s gonna be hard,  and it’s gonna hurt, and you are going to wish you"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,951458,957916,never picked up a tennis racquet!  But it will all be worth it in the end... when you win!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,957916,966208,"Well, I’m also going to coach you. And I’m gonna make sure  Angela’s issues don’t stand in the way of you enjoying yourself!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,966208,969875,"Umm, does anyone care what I think?  No!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,972416,975791,One-two-three-four!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,998416,1006666,"Oh, come on! It’s been two hours! Just make your move!  Hold on, Ben. Don’t rush me. I’m still deciding... Should I varnish"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1006666,1013958,"the deck, or repaint the porch? What’s the difference between  a porch and a deck anyway? I think  a porch is the one that has the --"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1013958,1019041,"Just do something!  Tom, you know what, you couldn’t be more wrong, okay?!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1019041,1025875,"Yes, I could... if I was you!  Where have you guys been? Hank still hasn’t taken his turn!  Make him take his turn!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1027083,1033458,"Focus, Hank. Competition is important. You owe it to yourself  to do everything possible to win..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1033458,1039500,"Hmm...  Don’t listen to her, buddy. Do whatever you want.  Just smile and enjoy the playing of the game!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1039500,1046291,"Focus, enjoy the game, whatever! Just go already!  Oh, so you think Hank should just waltz through the game,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1046291,1052583,"never trying, never caring?  And you think Hank should be so focused on winning at all costs"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1052583,1058666,that he can’t appreciate a single second of his favorite home-  renovation-themed board game?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1058916,1064416,"Yep, and he’s gonna win!  Maybe he will, maybe he won’t... but while  he’s playing, he’s going to be having a good time!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1064416,1071458,"You know, Ginger, what they’re saying could probably  apply to your tennis tournament, too.  Would you take your turn!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1071458,1078041,"THE NEXT DAY  Just go!  Hold on. This is the last move of the game, the one that’s gonna"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1078041,1086916,"finally end it... and that move is - this! No way, that! No. Uhu! Oh-oh."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1086916,1092458,Yep. No. I didn’t take my hand off the piece. Before you don’t take  your hand off it...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1092833,1098458,"That’s it, I quit!  You can’t quit!  Wiggity-welcome to the youth tennis final!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1098458,1105166,"It’s Ginger versus Darren!  Aloha!  Listen up, listen up, listen up. There are two things"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1105166,1110666,"that I know fo-sho!  Number one, eight-and-under tennis is cool! -- number two,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1110666,1117208,MCing eight-and-under tennis tournaments for 12 years isn’t  depressing at all!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1117333,1124458,"Ginger, now remember: Don’t worry about the outcome.  Just smile and have a good time."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1124500,1129625,"Right...  What? No. Ignore him, Ginger! No mercy!  Okay!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1129625,1135541,"Hey, Ginger! Is Angela really your coach?  Uh, I guess..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1136458,1143375,"Ha! Everyone knows she lost this tournament when  she was a child! If she’s your coach, you might as well forfeit!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1144166,1150041,"Hey! Watch your mouth, kid! Alright, Angela’s a great coach --  she’s sweet, she’s talented, she’s the single most caring person"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1150041,1156833,I’ve ever met and she’s got amazing eyes.  Oh...  Eye-eye-eye-eye great eye...sight.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1157000,1164083,"What I’m saying is, uh, Angela only wants what’s  best for uh, for Ginger... here. Right?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1165333,1171708,"No, Tom. I’ve been completely selfish.  I’ve been trying to live through Ginger, and that’s not fair to him"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1171708,1179416,"or to me... You know what, Ginger... have fun!  You’re a loser, your coach is a loser, and that guy who’s secretly"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1179416,1184916,"in love with your coach is a loser!  What?  What the what now?  Oh, forget what I told you before."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1184916,1191708,You gotta beat this kid.  4½ MINUTES LATER...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1192208,1198625,"Fourteen-love.  In my face!  Game, set, match! Darren!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1200166,1206750,"Ha! In your face, Ginger!  I’m Darren, I’m unstoppable, I’m the best at tennis."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1206750,1212041,"Hey buddy, at least you had fun.  That did not look like it was fun for Ginger!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1212041,1217250,"Good game, Darren.  Hey, you know what? You made it to the finals."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1217250,1225541,"Yeah. Seriously, that is a huge accomplishment.  I mean, who cares about some stupid tennis prize? -- I do."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1225708,1233708,"Congratulations, Darren! Instead of a trophy, we got you... a ticket  to the International Space Station!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1233708,1241375,Sweet!  The International Space Station! Are you serious?  International Space Station - what’s so fun about that?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1241375,1247416,"Hey, and just for you, we’ve filled the space station  with candy, fireworks and waterslides in zero gravity."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1247416,1255375,"Whoa! That sounds amazing!  Look out space station, here comes Darren. Jet pack engage."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1255708,1262458,"Okay, I’ve made my decision.  Yes!  And I’m going crown molding, for the win!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1262458,1263875,Ahh!!!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1268625,1273416,Huh. Guess we’ll have to start over...  What?!  Ahh!!!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1273958,1281500,Lady aaaaand gentlemen! Prepare yourselves for...  The greatest video game the world has ever known.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1281500,1287666,"“Safe Driving 2. No Right Turn On Red!""  You are all going down!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1287666,1293291,"No chance, tiny pants!  I’m gonna use turn signals  and hand signals, just to be safe!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1293291,1299666,"If someone cuts me off in traffic, I am gonna stay calm and give them  the benefit of the doubt! Maybe it’s an emergency."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1299666,1306791,Buckle up and start your engines! The race begins in three! Two! One
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1308500,1316416,Oh-no!  Why’s it all dark when my eyes aren’t closed?  This is a new experience for me and I don’t like it!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1317041,1324625,"Alright, nobody panic! Ben, what is going on?  Judging from the sudden loss of power, I’d say the power went out."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1324625,1330875,Everybody panic!  Wait! We plugged in our phones and our computers hours ago.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1330875,1334958,We can use those to entertain ourselves until the power comes back on.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1340125,1346791,"They’re all dead!  OH!!!  Ben, what’s the status of my lava lamp?!  Also dead! Ohhh!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1346791,1354666,And all because someone thought that a lava lamp was more important!?  It would have been sooo groovy.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1369583,1378416,Can you believe how boring things were after the power went out last night?  Seriously. That was the longest twenty-seven minutes of my life.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1378416,1384750,"I actually had a chance to think and I did not like it.  You’re all just lucky I was able to keep my cool. Without your precious phones,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1384750,1389833,"you were all like... “Oh noooo, what am I gonna doooo?”"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1389833,1399541,"Tom, that was you.  Yeah, that’s literally like all you said until the power came back on.  The point is, last night showed that we’ve become too dependent on technology."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1399541,1405958,"Like when’s the last time someone actually checked our mailbox?  Oh, I checked it right before my birthday and right after my birthday."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1405958,1411541,"Yah, I don’t live here.  I get all my mail online.  Really, well, then who is all that for?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1415083,1421458,"Okay, no sudden movement, everybody stand back, I am approaching the mailbox."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1427083,1434958,This is all junk mail.  It’s not all junk.  Here’s a letter addressed to Tom and Ben Enterprises from Un-Popular Science Magazine.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1435500,1440958,Whoa...What is it?  That’s been the most popular tech magazine since people read magazines.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1441208,1447625,"Let me see... Dear entrepreneur, we blah, blah, blah, blah..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1447916,1455708,"... so therefore, Un-Popular Science would like to honor your contributions  to the tech world by inviting you to visit our headquarters"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1455708,1463041,on Floppy Disk Island!”  Wow! Whoo!  Floppy disk island!  Wait... oh no... Huh?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1463041,1465458,They only sent one ticket.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1469458,1473500,Oh... Wow...  Wow!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1475125,1482958,"Wow!  I don’t want to tell you how to run your business, but I think you should send  some sort of a celebrity to represent you."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1482958,1488625,"Or someone young and cool!  No way, I’m the face of the company!  Yeah? Well, I’m the brains."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1488625,1496041,Ooh. I have a face and a brain!  So what are we gonna do?  What if... we all make a bet
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1496041,1502958,"I made my bed this morning. I’m gonna win! I’m gonna win!  Not a bed, Hank, a bet! Ooh, What kind of bet?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1502958,1509958,"Based on how we acted last night during the blackout, it seems safe to say  we’re all addicted to technology, right?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1509958,1517583,"Uh-huh!  Not me. Oh, high score!.  I’m sorry, what? I was texting.  So I propose the following contest: whoever can go the longest without using"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1517583,1524291,any cellphone or computer or any TV of any kind will win the ticket to Floppy Disk Island.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1524416,1530041,Whoop. I’m in.  Me too.  Then I'm in too because you have to include me or it’s not fair.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1530041,1536583,Prepare to feel the sting of a calculated competitive routing!  That means I’m in too
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1537000,1543833,"Alright, cough ’em up.  I know, I know. Come on, all of them.  Fine. Is that it? Yes! ... No!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1544833,1551916,"Let the contest begin!  Well one thing’s for sure, if I want to win,"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1551916,1557833,I need to stay away from this place as much as possible.  Yeah. Let’s get out of here. Too much temptation.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1557833,1564416,"Oh, Hank, isn’t today the season premiere of Crime & Punishment: DMV ?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1564416,1573708,"Oh yeah, that’s right  What? I’m out!  Hank? Just like that, you’re out? Yeah! The season finale was a cliff- hanger"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1573708,1579958,"where Hillbilly Jack got busted cutting in line.  I think he was framed, but I won’t know for sure until I watch it!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1580333,1584041,Poor Hank. Some people just can’t live without technology...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1586750,1594208,I can’t believe it’s only been seventeen minutes without technology!  How would I know. How long has it been? I don’t have my smart watch.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1594208,1601458,I miss music. I miss making it and listening to it and dancing to it like no one is watching.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1601458,1607750,"I miss online candy shopping, and the free instant delivery.  Tom! Tom?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1608458,1614541,"Yeah, what’s going on?  How are you holding up?  Huh? Oh, the contest? Yeah, I’m fine."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1616291,1622000,I’m okay... I can do this... people survived for thousands of years without electronics.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1622000,1631333,"How? What did they do?  Um! They farmed! We can farm! Farm with me, Ginger! Farm with me!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1631333,1637625,"Okay, Like this?  We’re doing it! We’re farming! Yes!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1637625,1646333,"I can hear it growing.  Now we must dance, young Ginger! Dance so the rain will come and water our crops!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1652000,1658375,"Hey, Angela -- whoa! Are you okay?  Shh! Listen!  Bah, bah, baaaah..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1658958,1663916,"Can you hear that? Oh, it’s so beautiful!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1664916,1670000,Sssss...  Uh... don’t you think it’s time that you quit the contest?
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1670000,1677041,"Zip it, Tom! Oh, you made him fly away. Come back, sweet maker of music!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1680666,1689458,"Hey, Ginger! It says here the online candy store is having a two-for-one sale.  Free instant delivery of every candy imaginable:"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1689458,1695083,"Chocolate Crusties, Neverending Nom Noms, Jelly Jim Jams, Clyde’s Original Rock Candies"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1695458,1700041,Even Gummy Goobers?!  Uh-huh. Extra sour.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1701375,1706750,"Hey, give that back!  Poor kid. Doesn’t know what to do without technology..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1706750,1710541,Me? I’m just enjoying the day.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1713166,1718250,"Ooh, Angela...have you heard the new number one hit song?  I think it’s called something like:"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1718250,1725041,"Dance, Dance, Don’t Stop Dancing.  Huh. Nice try, guys. No, I heard it too! -Really?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1725041,1730166,"No, not that I listen to that type of music...  But just go to any website on the entire the internet..."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1730166,1739708,"and it’ll probably just start playing! -Are you kidding?  Dance, Dance, Don’t Stop Dancing.  Oh! ... Dance, Dance, Don’t you dare Stop Dancing."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1742458,1748916,"Uhm, so excuse me, I’m just gonna go uhm ah, powder my nose.  Be right back."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1754041,1759333,And...I’m out!  Totally worth it.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1759666,1764833,"Yes! Too easy.  Looks like it’s just you and me now, partner."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1765333,1767708,"Yeah, partner."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1771666,1777500,"What is he doing? He’s winning this contest, that’s what he’s doing!  Get him, Tom!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1777500,1783666,That’s what I’m talkin’ about!  What was that? That... was my phone...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1784250,1789791,It must have an update available. And it sends a ... notification. I don’t care.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1789791,1793958,That was my computer... It must also have an update available...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1795041,1802083,"Good. No big deal... Wait, what was that?  That was the microwave. And that’s a burrito update for my mouth!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1802083,1807708,Ahhhhhh! I can’t take this anymore... Must! Update! Everything!
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1808125,1813708,"My dear sweet technology! I’m sorry, I’m so sorry! I’ll never leave you again, I promise!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1814958,1821125,"Congrats, Tom! I guess when it comes to  surviving without technology,  you are the strongest. Tom?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1821125,1829166,"He shoots... it’s up...Its good! Whoo!  I mean, whaaaaat? Hey, where did Ben go?"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1829166,1836750,"Oh hey, I won. Yippie.  Wait a second. Hey, I was  listening to that!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1836750,1843958,"I mean, hey, what is that?!  You’ve been listening to a basketball game this whole time?!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1843958,1849375,"He what?!  You cheated, which means I won!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1849375,1854750,Floppy Disk Island here I come.  But... Now excuse me while I pack.
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1855000,1862000,"Let's see. Laptop, check. Tablet, check. Cell phone, check. Back-up cell phone, check."
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1862250,1871166,"Yes. Bye-bye, friends...  And cheater! I’m off to celebrate my victory at Floppy Disk Island!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1871416,1880875,"Hey, Ben. Later.  But the letter says, “Be sure to bring the following: Candles, a hammock, a wooden club, flint and steel...”"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1880875,1889708,"Uh-oh, I think Ben forget some important things.  Like what? ""Unpopular Science Magazine invites you to the 'No Technology Party'?!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1889708,1895083,"Join us in remembering the past with no electronics.""  Tom, how could you not mention that?!"
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1895083,1900000,Well... I... I kinda skimmed parts of it... It’s a very long letter...
RGHNUE9Z3xI,1902833,1905083,I want to go home!
