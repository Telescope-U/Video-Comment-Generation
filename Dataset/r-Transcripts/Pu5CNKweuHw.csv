Pu5CNKweuHw,133,4470,"Following a visit from her son and grandson, an older woman searches"
Pu5CNKweuHw,4471,7941,through her fridge for the salt fish she’d wrapped the previous day.
Pu5CNKweuHw,8341,11910,"Pushing past leftovers, various sauces, and cans of"
Pu5CNKweuHw,11911,15515,"soda, she finds it wrapped in a thin muslin cloth."
Pu5CNKweuHw,16149,18952,She pulls it from the fridge before removing it from its
Pu5CNKweuHw,18952,23022,"wrapping, dunking it into a pot of water to rinse off the salt."
Pu5CNKweuHw,23423,27127,She slaps it into a frying pan her daughter had been pre-heating on the
Pu5CNKweuHw,27127,31831,"stove, the fish sizzling, filling the room with the delicious scent."
Pu5CNKweuHw,32432,35768,"A moment later, her son returns, child in tow,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,35935,38371,complaining that he’d forgotten something or other.
Pu5CNKweuHw,38738,42142,"But before she can fully realize what’s happening,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,42509,46613,"her grandson, only 11 years old, collapses."
Pu5CNKweuHw,47047,51885,"With the sublime smell of frying white fish still in her nose, she"
Pu5CNKweuHw,51885,56288,watches as her son desperately tries to resuscitate the young boy.
Pu5CNKweuHw,56756,60226,"In a terrified haze, an ambulance is called, and"
Pu5CNKweuHw,60360,64330,"her grandson, still clinging to life, is taken away."
Pu5CNKweuHw,65065,67333,What do you do when just the scent of
Pu5CNKweuHw,67333,70804,something can send you into a death spiral?
Pu5CNKweuHw,71237,74908,How do you even begin to navigate the world when one
Pu5CNKweuHw,74908,78410,"day, you can live your life as normal, but the next day"
Pu5CNKweuHw,78912,83216,just a single bite of your favourite meal could kill you?
Pu5CNKweuHw,99065,99966,Let’s get into it.
Pu5CNKweuHw,100667,104337,"Cameron Jean-Pierre was a bright 11 year old boy, happily"
Pu5CNKweuHw,104337,108141,attending 6th grade at Theodore Schor Middle School in New Jersey.
Pu5CNKweuHw,108508,113113,"It was the first day of 2019, and he was excited to celebrate"
Pu5CNKweuHw,113113,116282,the new year with his grandparents who lived in Brooklyn.
Pu5CNKweuHw,116683,117750,They had a good visit.
Pu5CNKweuHw,117951,120153,"Hugs and kisses were exchanged, before"
Pu5CNKweuHw,120153,122689,Cameron and his father left to return home.
Pu5CNKweuHw,123089,128093,"Moments later, Cameron’s grandparents and aunt started making dinner: Fried"
Pu5CNKweuHw,128093,133666,"Salt Fish, a common Caribbean dish made with cod, and a whole lotta salt."
Pu5CNKweuHw,134067,137971,"Then to his grandparents’ surprise, the boy and his father"
Pu5CNKweuHw,137971,140739,"returned, having forgotten something in the apartment."
Pu5CNKweuHw,141274,143643,"Suddenly, the boy collapses."
Pu5CNKweuHw,144010,146312,His breathing was laboured and wheezing.
Pu5CNKweuHw,146846,150750,"His father recognized the signs of an asthma attack, which the"
Pu5CNKweuHw,150750,155054,"boy had had before, and quickly lept into action administering"
Pu5CNKweuHw,155054,158324,a nebulizer which would deliver steroids in a mist form
Pu5CNKweuHw,158324,161828,"for Cameron to inhale, hopefully improving his breathing."
Pu5CNKweuHw,162662,164397,"Cameron’s condition started to improve,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,164831,167066,but took a turn for the worse shortly.
Pu5CNKweuHw,167634,170537,"An ambulance was called, and while they waited in"
Pu5CNKweuHw,170537,174774,"agony, Cameron told his father, “I feel like I’m dying”."
Pu5CNKweuHw,175175,177277,His father replied “Don’t say that!
Pu5CNKweuHw,177510,178711,What are you talking about?
Pu5CNKweuHw,178945,179979,Don’t say that.”
Pu5CNKweuHw,180580,185485,"Cameron slipped in unconsciousness, and his father began CPR."
Pu5CNKweuHw,185718,190256,"By the time the EMTs arrived, Cameron was still unresponsive."
Pu5CNKweuHw,190690,193593,He was taken by ambulance to Brookedale University
Pu5CNKweuHw,193593,197230,"Hospital and Medical Centre in Brooklyn, but when"
Pu5CNKweuHw,197230,200567,"he arrived, medical staff pronounced the boy dead."
Pu5CNKweuHw,201234,205370,"Speaking to reporters with WABC, Cameron’s"
Pu5CNKweuHw,205371,207574,father shared his son’s last words.
Pu5CNKweuHw,207574,214714,"“My son’s last words was: Daddy, I love you, daddy, I love you” then"
Pu5CNKweuHw,214714,218751,"the boy gave his father two kisses, before losing consciousness."
Pu5CNKweuHw,219619,222855,"Trying to make some sense of this tragedy, it appears at first"
Pu5CNKweuHw,222855,226926,"like Cameron’s death was sudden and without explanation, but the"
Pu5CNKweuHw,226926,230263,real answer is a lot more straightforward than you might expect.
Pu5CNKweuHw,230763,234634,"Cameron was allergic to fish, and suffered from a severe"
Pu5CNKweuHw,234701,238871,"allergic reaction, triggering an equally severe asthma attack."
Pu5CNKweuHw,239239,246112,"According to Dr. Robert A. Wood, director of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins"
Pu5CNKweuHw,246112,249749,University School of Medicine said that the coroner would likely
Pu5CNKweuHw,249749,254687,identify “this as a death from asthma induced by an airborne allergen”.
Pu5CNKweuHw,255154,257857,That airborne allergen being the fish
Pu5CNKweuHw,257857,260225,his family were cooking after he left.
Pu5CNKweuHw,260693,264630,But how could a food allergy be so severe that just the airborne
Pu5CNKweuHw,264631,268001,particles could put you in the hospital without ever touching it?
Pu5CNKweuHw,268334,269869,Let alone taking a bite?
Pu5CNKweuHw,270403,272739,"First off, let’s find out what allergies"
Pu5CNKweuHw,272739,275475,"really are, or at least, food allergies."
Pu5CNKweuHw,276009,279545,"According to Johns Hopkins, allergies are the most common chronic"
Pu5CNKweuHw,279545,282715,"health condition in the world, and they’re basically when your"
Pu5CNKweuHw,282715,287186,body’s immune system overreacts to otherwise harmless substances.
Pu5CNKweuHw,287654,289888,Allergic reactions are connected to an
Pu5CNKweuHw,289922,294827,"antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE."
Pu5CNKweuHw,294827,298331,When a person is exposed to an allergen their body produces
Pu5CNKweuHw,298331,302969,"IgE antibodies, which would normally target and destroy harmful"
Pu5CNKweuHw,302969,308107,"substances, but instead go too hard, and cause harm to the person."
Pu5CNKweuHw,308508,312311,"However, how much harm depends on how sensitive the allergy."
Pu5CNKweuHw,312879,317016,"For example, for someone with a mild allergy to apples, eating"
Pu5CNKweuHw,317016,320653,them may just cause an itchy mouth and throat without much else.
Pu5CNKweuHw,321054,324423,"But for someone like Cameron, just the airborne"
Pu5CNKweuHw,324424,327627,particles were enough to trigger a severe reaction.
Pu5CNKweuHw,328161,330897,I do want to dispel a misconception though.
Pu5CNKweuHw,331331,334867,"In most cases, it’s the proteins that are released by the"
Pu5CNKweuHw,334867,339872,"cooking process that trigger allergies, not the smell itself."
Pu5CNKweuHw,340306,343976,"For Cameron, the fish cooking on the stove sent steam into"
Pu5CNKweuHw,343976,348214,"the air, aerosolizing the proteins, forcing the boy to inhale"
Pu5CNKweuHw,348214,352384,"the allergens into his lungs, triggering his intense reaction."
Pu5CNKweuHw,352852,357155,"With an allergy, and asthma, Cameron was particularly vulnerable."
Pu5CNKweuHw,357690,360727,"To add to the tragedy, if the fish had been cooked in"
Pu5CNKweuHw,360727,364163,"the oven, at a lower temperature, the allergens that took"
Pu5CNKweuHw,364163,367533,Cameron’s life might not have been released into the air.
Pu5CNKweuHw,367967,371537,"Allergic reactions can be recognized by itching, nausea,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,371704,375141,"elevated heart rate, swelling, and difficulty breathing."
Pu5CNKweuHw,375641,379746,"Not every allergic reaction needs to be treated in a hospital, but if you"
Pu5CNKweuHw,379746,384484,"start having any breathing issues, go to the emergency room immediately."
Pu5CNKweuHw,385017,387520,Mild reactions can usually be treated with
Pu5CNKweuHw,387520,389621,a course of over the counter allergy meds.
Pu5CNKweuHw,390289,393760,"If you have any seasonal allergies, you’re probably familiar with"
Pu5CNKweuHw,393760,399365,"antihistamines, drugs like Benadryl, Claritin, or Allegra among others."
Pu5CNKweuHw,399732,403603,"However, tracking your reactions is the most important thing,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,403870,408173,"since severe reactions can feel like mild reactions at first,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,408508,411577,it’s how quickly you deteriorate that differentiates them.
Pu5CNKweuHw,412078,415014,"For severe reactions, medical staff are likely"
Pu5CNKweuHw,415014,417850,to treat you with antihistamines on an IV to
Pu5CNKweuHw,417850,420987,speed up how quickly your body feels the effects.
Pu5CNKweuHw,421487,425224,"These drugs do not improve your airway obstruction, so"
Pu5CNKweuHw,425258,428828,epinephrine should always be administered first in emergencies.
Pu5CNKweuHw,429729,432198,The main life threatening condition that accompanies
Pu5CNKweuHw,432231,436401,"allergic reactions is called anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic"
Pu5CNKweuHw,436402,439872,"shock, which triggers the swelling of body tissues."
Pu5CNKweuHw,440239,442708,A person’s tongue and throat can swell up to
Pu5CNKweuHw,442708,445878,"the point their airway closes, suffocating them."
Pu5CNKweuHw,446379,448748,Just because you haven’t had any allergic
Pu5CNKweuHw,448748,451750,reactions don’t think that you’ll never have one.
Pu5CNKweuHw,452251,457023,"While allergies generally develop in childhood, and decrease in severity"
Pu5CNKweuHw,457023,461661,"by your 20s and 30s, they can present at any point in your life."
Pu5CNKweuHw,461894,464197,Just ask journalist Kila Peeples.
Pu5CNKweuHw,464697,468901,"The 42 year old had never had any allergies, but"
Pu5CNKweuHw,469035,472605,"one day, after eating shrimp and rice, a dish she’d"
Pu5CNKweuHw,472605,476242,"had many many times before, something happened."

Pu5CNKweuHw,547947,551450,“Immediately the inner part of my lip started to itch.
Pu5CNKweuHw,551851,553452,I didn’t think anything of it.
Pu5CNKweuHw,553619,555888,"I was just like, ‘Oh, that’s weird’”"
Pu5CNKweuHw,556389,558790,"Kila was awoken a couple hours later,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,558991,561928,only to find her lips had doubled in size.
Pu5CNKweuHw,562361,564797,"She took Benadryl, and went back to sleep."
Pu5CNKweuHw,565231,569268,"Within the hour, her cat was pawing at her throat, and a"
Pu5CNKweuHw,569268,573139,voice inside her told her to get to urgent care immediately.
Pu5CNKweuHw,573806,576108,"When she arrived, the nurse examining her"
Pu5CNKweuHw,576275,578344,throat told her that it was closing up.
Pu5CNKweuHw,578811,582782,"Medical staff pumped her full of medication, and questioned her."
Pu5CNKweuHw,583316,585484,“Do you have any allergies?” they asked.
Pu5CNKweuHw,586252,589388,"“I have no allergies,” she replied, only to"
Pu5CNKweuHw,589388,592692,"receive a matter of fact response, “now you do’."
Pu5CNKweuHw,593359,598030,What makes sudden onset allergies in adulthood so strange is that something
Pu5CNKweuHw,598030,602435,"that doesn’t bother you today, could send you to the hospital tomorrow."
Pu5CNKweuHw,602902,606438,"But regardless of whether it’s in childhood or in adulthood,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,606572,610610,we still don’t really know how or why allergies develop.
Pu5CNKweuHw,611210,614780,"According to The Carolina Asthma and Allergy Center, what we do"
Pu5CNKweuHw,614780,618551,know is that it’s impacted by a number of genetic and environmental
Pu5CNKweuHw,618551,622321,"factors, like the hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy."
Pu5CNKweuHw,622622,625958,"That being said, it’s intensely complicated."
Pu5CNKweuHw,626325,627860,Like my Elden Ring build.
Pu5CNKweuHw,628561,629662,"Haha, that’s a joke."
Pu5CNKweuHw,629762,633799,"My Elden Ring build is two katanas, because if it ain’t broke…"
Pu5CNKweuHw,634433,637402,Sometimes a person can grow to adulthood without ever
Pu5CNKweuHw,637403,639705,"encountering the substance that they’re allergic to,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,640072,643743,giving the appearance of a “sudden onset allergy” when in
Pu5CNKweuHw,643743,647146,"reality, they’ve been allergic to it their entire life."
Pu5CNKweuHw,647413,649715,"Though it matters little, since either way,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,650049,652118,you’re dealing with a new chronic condition.
Pu5CNKweuHw,652685,656989,"Like many chronic conditions, there aren’t cut and dry “treatments” for"
Pu5CNKweuHw,657023,661360,"food allergies, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything we can do."
Pu5CNKweuHw,661961,665531,"First off, if you’re in anaphylactic shock, then your priority"
Pu5CNKweuHw,665531,668868,should be to get to the hospital as soon as humanly possible.
Pu5CNKweuHw,669402,672638,With your airway swelling to the point that it could possibly close
Pu5CNKweuHw,672638,676809,"up, it’s imperative that you get medical attention immediately."
Pu5CNKweuHw,677176,680846,"Now, in addition to that, you can also take epinephrine."
Pu5CNKweuHw,681113,685151,"For the uninitiated, epinephrine is a manufactured form of our"
Pu5CNKweuHw,685151,689288,"bodies’ natural adrenaline, and is used as a muscle relaxant, to"
Pu5CNKweuHw,689288,693059,help open up your airway in the case of a severe allergic reaction.
Pu5CNKweuHw,693426,696429,It also improves blood pressure and increases your heart rate.
Pu5CNKweuHw,696862,700433,Epinephrine is usually administered using specialized auto
Pu5CNKweuHw,700433,704670,"injectors, the most common of which is the brand Epi-Pen, though"
Pu5CNKweuHw,704670,710476,"there are others, like Allerject, Auvi-Q, Adrenaclick and Symjepi."
Pu5CNKweuHw,710943,714213,It’s also useful to note that there aren’t any negative side
Pu5CNKweuHw,714213,717650,effects of taking a dose of epinephrine when you didn’t need
Pu5CNKweuHw,717650,722288,"it, but like any drug, taking too much will harm you though."
Pu5CNKweuHw,723022,725490,"Now, I do need to clear up a quick myth."
Pu5CNKweuHw,725991,730062,Epinephrine is not an instant cure for a severe allergic reaction.
Pu5CNKweuHw,730629,735634,"It is the only known drug that can reverse symptoms of anaphylaxis,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,735935,740206,"however, it does not suddenly stop your body’s immune response."
Pu5CNKweuHw,740673,744175,Its main role is to ensure that your airway remains clear enough
Pu5CNKweuHw,744176,747313,"that you don’t suffocate before you make it to the hospital,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,747580,751050,which is where you should go if you’re suffering from anaphylaxis.
Pu5CNKweuHw,751784,756122,Allergic reactions are occasionally mistaken for asthma attacks.
Pu5CNKweuHw,756422,761393,"Sometimes, severe allergic reactions can trigger “bronchospasms”,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,761594,764730,"which is when your bronchi, tubes that connect your windpipe"
Pu5CNKweuHw,764730,768134,"to your lungs, constrict, making it difficult to breathe."
Pu5CNKweuHw,768667,772271,"If you recall from Cameron’s story, his father administered"
Pu5CNKweuHw,772304,776542,"a nebulizer, a medication for asthma, but to no avail."
Pu5CNKweuHw,777476,781013,"Cameron’s father did all he could, but that’s the nature"
Pu5CNKweuHw,781013,784550,"of tragedy, it’s easy to see what to do in retrospect."
Pu5CNKweuHw,785017,788921,Unfortunately epinephrine is the only viable medication
Pu5CNKweuHw,788921,792825,"to treat anaphylaxis, and while bronchodilators"
Pu5CNKweuHw,792858,795860,"can help, they should always be a follow up."
Pu5CNKweuHw,796428,801000,"There are a wide variety of food allergies, but interestingly"
Pu5CNKweuHw,801000,804837,"enough common allergens vary in global distribution,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,805137,808874,while a handful of allergies overlap across most cultures.
Pu5CNKweuHw,809408,813412,"Wheat is a common allergen, however celiac disease, and a"
Pu5CNKweuHw,813412,817917,gluten intolerance are not what we refer to as wheat allergies.
Pu5CNKweuHw,818551,821453,"If you have a wheat allergy, you can tolerate"
Pu5CNKweuHw,821487,824423,gluten so long as it does not come from wheat.
Pu5CNKweuHw,824890,827893,Wheat allergies are the leading cause of anaphylaxis
Pu5CNKweuHw,828127,832464,"in Japan and Korea, above both shellfish and nuts."
Pu5CNKweuHw,833132,834834,Then there’s fish.
Pu5CNKweuHw,835100,840673,"In the US, about 1% of the population is allergic to our finned friends"
Pu5CNKweuHw,840706,845344,"according to FARE, the Food Allergy Research and Education’s website."
Pu5CNKweuHw,845744,848380,"In Asia however, rates differ."
Pu5CNKweuHw,848848,854820,"Fish allergy is quite prevalent in the Philippines at 2.29%, as opposed"
Pu5CNKweuHw,854820,862761,to Singapore and Thailand with rates as low as between 0.26%-0.29%.
Pu5CNKweuHw,862761,865230,Egg allergy is also quite common no
Pu5CNKweuHw,865264,867032,matter what side of the world you’re from.
Pu5CNKweuHw,867600,872303,"In a US study, researchers found that egg allergy could be observed in"
Pu5CNKweuHw,873472,879712,".9% of all American children, and 1.3% of children under 5, but noted that"
Pu5CNKweuHw,880579,885584,68% of children will outgrow their egg allergy by the time they’re 16.
Pu5CNKweuHw,886252,890789,"In China, that rate is higher, around 3-4%."
Pu5CNKweuHw,891357,895794,"According to a 2019 study, cow's milk allergy affects between"
Pu5CNKweuHw,895794,900699,2-3% of all infants regardless of the culture they’re from.
Pu5CNKweuHw,901133,904904,"That being said, 90% of children with a cow’s milk"
Pu5CNKweuHw,904937,908474,allergy will outgrow it by the time they’re 3 years old.
Pu5CNKweuHw,909108,913178,Shellfish allergies also cover much of the human population.
Pu5CNKweuHw,913579,918117,"The term shellfish includes crustaceans like crabs, lobster, shrimp,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,918150,923188,"and prawn; and mollusks like squid, oysters, scallops, and clams."
Pu5CNKweuHw,923689,929161,"Approximately 2% of the US population has this allergy, but"
Pu5CNKweuHw,929161,933165,"in South-East Asia, that rate increases to upwards of 5%."
Pu5CNKweuHw,934667,936969,The last of the most common allergies is
Pu5CNKweuHw,937036,940539,"most well known, peanuts and treenuts!"
Pu5CNKweuHw,940839,943175,"This includes everything from almonds,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,943242,945911,"hazelnuts, cashews, pecans, and more!"
Pu5CNKweuHw,946378,949315,"But not coconuts, even though the FDA"
Pu5CNKweuHw,949348,951984,technically classifies them as a tree nut.
Pu5CNKweuHw,952384,954586,"Worldwide, these allergies afflict"
Pu5CNKweuHw,954620,958190,somewhere around 3% of the total population.
Pu5CNKweuHw,958691,963227,In the United States that percentage is around 1% of children.
Pu5CNKweuHw,963729,968233,"In the late 90s to the early 2000s, the west experienced what some"
Pu5CNKweuHw,968233,973238,call the “food allergy epidemic” which created the impression that
Pu5CNKweuHw,973305,977643,other cultures didn’t experience the same level of allergy prevalence.
Pu5CNKweuHw,978210,982414,"This was corroborated by studies performed in Korea, the Philippines,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,982581,989755,"Taiwan, China and Thailand, finding rates as low as 0% to 1.1%, about"
Pu5CNKweuHw,989755,994927,"half of the rates that appear in the UK, Canada, the US and Australia."
Pu5CNKweuHw,995427,999631,"However, according to a 2018 study “The Epidemiology of"
Pu5CNKweuHw,999631,1003235,"Food Allergy in the Global Context”, rates of peanuts"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1003235,1007172,as a cause of anaphylaxis in Asia have been rising.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1007673,1011175,"The authors of the study say that ""food allergy prevalence"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1011176,1015381,may be expected to increase in Asia and Africa as there is
Pu5CNKweuHw,1015381,1019550,"increased urbanization and adoption of a Westernized lifestyle.""."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1020052,1024022,So why do common allergies vary from country to country?
Pu5CNKweuHw,1024556,1026625,This probably has a lot to do with the
Pu5CNKweuHw,1026625,1029527,lifestyles of people living in particular places.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1029895,1033332,"It appears that allergies, on a cultural level, seem"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1033332,1036301,to develop based on foods that are commonly eaten.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1036802,1040538,"As more people eat a particular food, it’s more likely"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1040538,1044142,someone in that population will have a bad reaction to it.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1044642,1047246,"However, this isn’t always the case."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1047579,1051483,"For example, peanuts are a staple of Thai diets,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1051750,1055020,but their rate of peanut allergies is virtually 0.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1055421,1058190,So it’s not really clear what is at work here.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1058690,1062027,There are allergies that are exclusive to Asia as well.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1062561,1065764,"For example, buckwheat is one of the most common source"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1065764,1069535,"of anaphylaxis in Japan, where it’s consumed commonly."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1070069,1074106,"On that same note, bird’s nest, a Chinese delicacy made from"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1074106,1077109,the saliva of swiftlets that we’ve talked about in a previous
Pu5CNKweuHw,1077109,1081346,"video, is a common source of anaphylaxis in South East Asia."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1082114,1086418,"Legume allergies, specifically soybean allergies, are quite frequent in"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1086452,1090989,"India, where vegetarian diets mean high volumes of soybeans are consumed."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1091890,1093892,Another study out of India found that
Pu5CNKweuHw,1094226,1097028,eggplant allergies are on the rise as well.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1097729,1101867,"However, this is complicated when you learn that children of Asian"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1101867,1106438,descent who grow up in Asia have a lower rate of food allergies than
Pu5CNKweuHw,1106438,1110509,children born to Asian parents who grow up in Western countries.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1111243,1113812,"Again, scientists and researchers haven’t"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1113812,1117015,"found out why, but isn’t it fascinating?!"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1117749,1122187,What isn’t fascinating is the rising cost of living with an allergy.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1122688,1126959,"As the world’s most common chronic disease, even something as simple as"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1126959,1131630,the rising cost of epinephrine has an effect through the entire community.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1132231,1139003,"Just 2 Epi-Pens, cost upwards of 600 dollars a piece in the United States."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1139471,1141773,This issue is compounded by the relatively
Pu5CNKweuHw,1141773,1144175,short expiry time of epinephrine.
Pu5CNKweuHw,1144810,1149448,"You can expect them to expire within a year, and given the life threatening"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1149448,1153886,"nature of certain allergies, individuals and families are basically"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1153886,1158190,"married to buying them year in, year out, in case of an emergency."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1158824,1161860,"Now, what makes living with a life threatening allergy"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1162661,1167266,"especially convenient is that since 2007, Mylan, the"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1167266,1170402,pharmaceutical company that bought the rights to manufacture
Pu5CNKweuHw,1170569,1175574,"Epi-Pens, has raised the price from 100 dollars to 600 dollars."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1175974,1180345,"But don’t worry, Heather Bresch, chief executive for the company,"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1180579,1185250,"said that the public “needed a solution, and wanted a solution”."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1185884,1189988,"So did they immediately reverse this decision, and change the price back?"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1191590,1197162,"No, they released a generic “budget” version selling for… 300 dollars."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1197696,1201533,"Last time I checked, 300 was more than 100, right?"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1202201,1206638,"In Canada, anaphylaxis level allergies are considered disabilities under"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1206672,1210442,"both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and our human rights legislation."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1210776,1214313,While Canadian prices for epinephrine are lower with an EpiPen
Pu5CNKweuHw,1214313,1218950,"injector costing about 120 dollars, the reality is the same."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1219685,1223055,"When you are born with a life threatening allergy, or develop it"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1223055,1227593,"suddenly as an adult, in order to manage it, you must shell out"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1227626,1231663,"hundreds, if not thousands of dollars more than everyone else."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1232497,1236033,"In America, if you had a sudden life threatening reaction to your"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1236068,1241106,"food, without insurance, you can expect to pay around 20 thousand"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1241139,1247045,"dollars for the emergency room, between 210-600 dollars for allergy"
Pu5CNKweuHw,1247045,1251883,"tests, and then an additional 600 dollars a year for epi-pens."
Pu5CNKweuHw,1252451,1255220,"That’s a big aller-jeez, from me."
