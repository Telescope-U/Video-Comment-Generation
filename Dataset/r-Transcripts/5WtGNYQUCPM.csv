5WtGNYQUCPM,3952,5654,Judy: The U.S. Supreme court
5WtGNYQUCPM,5787,7422,handed another victory today to
5WtGNYQUCPM,7422,9624,religious rights advocates. As
5WtGNYQUCPM,9758,10992,-- advocates.
5WtGNYQUCPM,11426,12427,"As John yang reports, it had to"
5WtGNYQUCPM,12427,12894,do with an unusual education
5WtGNYQUCPM,13028,13595,funding program in a small new
5WtGNYQUCPM,13728,19434,England state.
5WtGNYQUCPM,20435,20935,"John: Judy, the case involves"
5WtGNYQUCPM,21436,23438,"Olivia Carson of glenburn,"
5WtGNYQUCPM,23438,23939,"Maine, a town so small that"
5WtGNYQUCPM,24439,26608,like half the state's school
5WtGNYQUCPM,26741,27442,districts it doesn't have a
5WtGNYQUCPM,27442,27675,high school.
5WtGNYQUCPM,28443,29444,"Under Maine law, those students"
5WtGNYQUCPM,29444,31446,may get taxpayer money to help
5WtGNYQUCPM,31446,32981,pay tuition at private schools
5WtGNYQUCPM,33448,34449,as long as they're nonsectarian.
5WtGNYQUCPM,35617,36818,"Because of that restriction, the"
5WtGNYQUCPM,36952,38954,state would not pay for Olivia
5WtGNYQUCPM,39454,40754,to go to bangor Christian
5WtGNYQUCPM,40889,41456,"school, which her parents had"
5WtGNYQUCPM,41590,43792,chosen for her.
5WtGNYQUCPM,43925,47461,"Today, a 6-3 majority of the"
5WtGNYQUCPM,47462,47929,court said that violates the
5WtGNYQUCPM,48063,50999,first amendment's guarantee of
5WtGNYQUCPM,51466,53468,free exercise of religion.
5WtGNYQUCPM,53468,53835,Marcia Coyle is the chief
5WtGNYQUCPM,53969,55470,Washington correspondent for the
5WtGNYQUCPM,55470,59474,national law journal.
5WtGNYQUCPM,59474,59907,This division fell along the
5WtGNYQUCPM,60475,67481,usual liberal-conservative
5WtGNYQUCPM,67482,67582,lines.
5WtGNYQUCPM,67716,71486,Six conservative justices.
5WtGNYQUCPM,71486,75023,"Chief justice Roberts wrote, a"
5WtGNYQUCPM,75490,78493,state need not subsidize private
5WtGNYQUCPM,78493,80995,"education, but once a state"
5WtGNYQUCPM,82497,87002,"decides to do so, it cannot"
5WtGNYQUCPM,87502,87736,disqualify some private schools
5WtGNYQUCPM,87869,88503,solely because they are
5WtGNYQUCPM,88503,91506,religious.
5WtGNYQUCPM,91506,93007,The state pays tuition for
5WtGNYQUCPM,93508,94543,certain students of private
5WtGNYQUCPM,94676,95510,schools so long as the schools
5WtGNYQUCPM,95510,98613,are not religious.
5WtGNYQUCPM,98747,99514,That is discrimination against
5WtGNYQUCPM,99514,99681,religion.
5WtGNYQUCPM,101516,103084,"Marcia, can you unpack the"
5WtGNYQUCPM,103518,103551,reasoning here?
5WtGNYQUCPM,105520,107889,Marsha: This case was a step
5WtGNYQUCPM,108757,111526,beyond recent cases involving
5WtGNYQUCPM,111526,113528,the free exercise clause on the
5WtGNYQUCPM,113528,114529,supreme court.
5WtGNYQUCPM,114563,117532,In the most recent case
5WtGNYQUCPM,117532,119534,"involving schools, it was a"
5WtGNYQUCPM,119534,123804,scholarship program that
5WtGNYQUCPM,123938,126575,religious parents and schools
5WtGNYQUCPM,126708,127542,were excluded from and to the
5WtGNYQUCPM,127542,131546,court reiterated that you cannot
5WtGNYQUCPM,131546,133782,"discriminate, if a state is"
5WtGNYQUCPM,134549,135884,"subsidizing private schools, you"
5WtGNYQUCPM,136017,137852,cannot discriminate solely on
5WtGNYQUCPM,137986,139553,the basis of religious status.
5WtGNYQUCPM,140755,143558,"The court left open, what about"
5WtGNYQUCPM,143558,146694,if the money is used for
5WtGNYQUCPM,146828,148563,"religious purposes by a school,"
5WtGNYQUCPM,148563,148830,not just because it is a
5WtGNYQUCPM,148963,151566,religious school?
5WtGNYQUCPM,152133,155569,Today the courts seemed to say
5WtGNYQUCPM,155570,157572,there is no distinction.
5WtGNYQUCPM,157572,159574,If a state is subsidizing
5WtGNYQUCPM,159574,161576,"private schools, and hast to"
5WtGNYQUCPM,161576,164579,also subsidize religious private
5WtGNYQUCPM,164579,164978,schools.
5WtGNYQUCPM,166948,169584,This is based on the free
5WtGNYQUCPM,169951,170985,exercise clause.
5WtGNYQUCPM,173154,176991,The first amendment says two
5WtGNYQUCPM,177592,178593,things about religion.
5WtGNYQUCPM,178593,178927,Congress shall make no law
5WtGNYQUCPM,180595,182997,respecting the establishment of
5WtGNYQUCPM,183131,183698,a religion or prohibiting the
5WtGNYQUCPM,183832,187602,free exercise of religion.
5WtGNYQUCPM,187602,189003,"Those causes, as the court has"
5WtGNYQUCPM,189137,194109,"said, are sometimes in tension"
5WtGNYQUCPM,194609,194709,with each other.
5WtGNYQUCPM,194709,196611,And that was the case here.
5WtGNYQUCPM,196611,199614,You had parents who wanted their
5WtGNYQUCPM,199648,203618,students to attend religious
5WtGNYQUCPM,203618,205153,"schools, saying you are"
5WtGNYQUCPM,205620,205887,violating free exercise rights.
5WtGNYQUCPM,206020,206988,"But at the same time, the state"
5WtGNYQUCPM,207122,211125,of Maine said if we subsidize
5WtGNYQUCPM,211626,212627,you and private religious
5WtGNYQUCPM,212694,213628,"schools, we might be violating"
5WtGNYQUCPM,213628,215630,the establishment clause.
5WtGNYQUCPM,217232,218833,John: Justice Breyer wrote the
5WtGNYQUCPM,218967,221034,main dissent for the three
5WtGNYQUCPM,221169,223638,liberal justices.
5WtGNYQUCPM,224639,236985,And justice Sonia Sotomayor said
5WtGNYQUCPM,237118,239220,", any state that values its"
5WtGNYQUCPM,239654,241956,historic antiestablishment
5WtGNYQUCPM,242090,243657,interest more than this court
5WtGNYQUCPM,243692,244793,does will have to curtail the
5WtGNYQUCPM,244926,246661,support it offers to its
5WtGNYQUCPM,246661,246795,citizens.
5WtGNYQUCPM,246795,250732,Help us understand this argument
5WtGNYQUCPM,250865,250965,.
5WtGNYQUCPM,251099,252701,Marsha: I think she is saying
5WtGNYQUCPM,252834,254836,that basically the majority has
5WtGNYQUCPM,254969,255670,elevated the free exercise
5WtGNYQUCPM,255670,259207,clause above the establishment
5WtGNYQUCPM,259674,262143,clause of the first amendment
5WtGNYQUCPM,262277,263278,and as she said at the opening
5WtGNYQUCPM,263678,266681,"of her dissent, sort of"
5WtGNYQUCPM,266681,270118,destroying the old doctrine
5WtGNYQUCPM,270251,271686,known as the wall of separation
5WtGNYQUCPM,271686,272987,between church and state.
5WtGNYQUCPM,273922,275290,Justice Breyer was also
5WtGNYQUCPM,275690,278993,concerned about this elevation
5WtGNYQUCPM,279127,280695,of the free exercise clause over
5WtGNYQUCPM,281029,281695,the establishment clause.
5WtGNYQUCPM,281696,282197,He said the court has always
5WtGNYQUCPM,282697,288703,said there are ways to allow
5WtGNYQUCPM,288703,290705,states to deal with specific
5WtGNYQUCPM,290805,291772,problems without violating the
5WtGNYQUCPM,291906,292707,free exercise clause or
5WtGNYQUCPM,292974,295076,establishment laws and he
5WtGNYQUCPM,295210,296009,thought that Dean was doing
5WtGNYQUCPM,296144,296711,exactly that in order to deal
5WtGNYQUCPM,297879,301216,with the problem of a lack of
5WtGNYQUCPM,301716,303017,public high schools in rural
5WtGNYQUCPM,303151,303318,areas.
5WtGNYQUCPM,305854,307288,So this is the continuation of a
5WtGNYQUCPM,307722,308990,trend in the supreme court.
5WtGNYQUCPM,310725,311292,This conservative majority truly
5WtGNYQUCPM,311726,313728,does favor of free exercise
5WtGNYQUCPM,313728,314729,clause.
5WtGNYQUCPM,314763,320735,So the court is really expanding
5WtGNYQUCPM,320869,321736,the role of religion in public
5WtGNYQUCPM,322771,324839,life and I am not quite sure how
5WtGNYQUCPM,324973,326039,much farther it will go.
5WtGNYQUCPM,328743,329744,"John: Marcia Coyle, thank you"
