0v-RpuPILX0,0,960,[Music]
0v-RpuPILX0,960,3560,hello this is chef john from
0v-RpuPILX0,3560,6040,foodwishes.com with
0v-RpuPILX0,6040,9120,filipino-style barbecued chicken
0v-RpuPILX0,9120,10719,that's right i'm going to show you how i
0v-RpuPILX0,10719,12400,make what might be the best barbecue
0v-RpuPILX0,12400,14400,chicken you probably have never had
0v-RpuPILX0,14400,16080,which i should have already done since
0v-RpuPILX0,16080,18400,this really is incredible stuff but i
0v-RpuPILX0,18400,20480,always hesitated because one of the main
0v-RpuPILX0,20480,22720,ingredients is banana ketchup which i
0v-RpuPILX0,22720,24400,wasn't sure you could get
0v-RpuPILX0,24400,26240,but then i remembered something very
0v-RpuPILX0,26240,27279,important
0v-RpuPILX0,27279,28880,i actually teach people how to cook
0v-RpuPILX0,28880,31199,things so with that let's go ahead and
0v-RpuPILX0,31199,33200,get started by making a little bit of
0v-RpuPILX0,33200,35280,homemade banana ketchup which is going
0v-RpuPILX0,35280,37600,to start with one very ripe banana
0v-RpuPILX0,37600,39600,all right if it's not turning black put
0v-RpuPILX0,39600,40559,it back
0v-RpuPILX0,40559,41920,and it really doesn't matter if parts of
0v-RpuPILX0,41920,44160,the banana are bruised and battered as
0v-RpuPILX0,44160,46000,long as it's very ripe and sweet it's
0v-RpuPILX0,46000,47920,going to be perfect for this
0v-RpuPILX0,47920,49440,and then to our banana we will add some
0v-RpuPILX0,49440,52800,tomato paste which is one way to go here
0v-RpuPILX0,52800,54160,okay we could just add some regular
0v-RpuPILX0,54160,55120,ketchup
0v-RpuPILX0,55120,57199,and shorten the ingredient list a bit
0v-RpuPILX0,57199,59600,but i do prefer this formula and we'll
0v-RpuPILX0,59600,61680,also toss in some brown sugar
0v-RpuPILX0,61680,64080,as well as some apple cider vinegar
0v-RpuPILX0,64080,65119,although if you have it you're supposed
0v-RpuPILX0,65119,67040,to use banana peel vinegar
0v-RpuPILX0,67040,68560,which you don't
0v-RpuPILX0,68560,69760,and we'll also do a little bit of
0v-RpuPILX0,69760,71280,vegetable oil
0v-RpuPILX0,71280,73040,followed by some freshly and finely
0v-RpuPILX0,73040,74560,grated ginger
0v-RpuPILX0,74560,76560,some onion powder
0v-RpuPILX0,76560,78640,some garlic powder
0v-RpuPILX0,78640,81040,and of course do not forget the cayenne
0v-RpuPILX0,81040,82640,and then we will finish up by seasoning
0v-RpuPILX0,82640,84720,this with some allspice
0v-RpuPILX0,84720,87119,as well as a little touch of turmeric
0v-RpuPILX0,87119,88720,which if you haven't gotten the memo
0v-RpuPILX0,88720,90880,prevents every disease
0v-RpuPILX0,90880,92479,and then once everything's in there
0v-RpuPILX0,92479,94400,we'll go ahead and take a masher or i
0v-RpuPILX0,94400,96479,guess you could use the back of a fork
0v-RpuPILX0,96479,98720,and we'll go ahead and mash that banana
0v-RpuPILX0,98720,100079,and we don't need to get a perfect
0v-RpuPILX0,100079,102320,smooth puree here okay those smaller
0v-RpuPILX0,102320,103600,pieces are going to break down as we
0v-RpuPILX0,103600,104720,cook this
0v-RpuPILX0,104720,105759,and then once we have our mixture
0v-RpuPILX0,105759,107680,looking a little something like this we
0v-RpuPILX0,107680,109600,will add the last ingredient which is
0v-RpuPILX0,109600,110960,going to be a nice big splash of cold
0v-RpuPILX0,110960,112320,fresh water
0v-RpuPILX0,112320,113680,which is not only going to help us rinse
0v-RpuPILX0,113680,115040,off our masher
0v-RpuPILX0,115040,116479,but it will allow us to cook this for
0v-RpuPILX0,116479,117920,long enough for all the flavors to come
0v-RpuPILX0,117920,119840,together and not have the mixture get
0v-RpuPILX0,119840,121840,too thick too fast
0v-RpuPILX0,121840,123040,and that's it once that's all been
0v-RpuPILX0,123040,125280,accomplished we will head to the stove
0v-RpuPILX0,125280,126960,and we will place this over medium-high
0v-RpuPILX0,126960,129360,heat and once this mixture starts
0v-RpuPILX0,129360,131440,simmering we can give it a stir and
0v-RpuPILX0,131440,133680,reduce our heat to medium at which point
0v-RpuPILX0,133680,134800,we're going to cook it for about seven
0v-RpuPILX0,134800,136319,to ten minutes
0v-RpuPILX0,136319,138800,or until it reduces down and thickens up
0v-RpuPILX0,138800,141200,and kind of looks like banana ketchup
0v-RpuPILX0,141200,143200,and as you know whenever we're watching
0v-RpuPILX0,143200,145040,something simmer we always try to
0v-RpuPILX0,145040,146800,remember what we forgot
0v-RpuPILX0,146800,148400,which in my case this time was a big
0v-RpuPILX0,148400,149840,pinch of salt
0v-RpuPILX0,149840,152160,so i went ahead and stirred that in
0v-RpuPILX0,152160,154239,and i continued stirring and cooking
0v-RpuPILX0,154239,157200,cooking anester until my banana ketchup
0v-RpuPILX0,157200,158959,look like this
0v-RpuPILX0,158959,160720,at which point we can turn off the heat
0v-RpuPILX0,160720,162560,because we're done
0v-RpuPILX0,162560,164080,and if we were making this to use as a
0v-RpuPILX0,164080,166160,condiment and we're gonna bottle it i
0v-RpuPILX0,166160,167760,probably would strain it
0v-RpuPILX0,167760,170400,but for this recipe we don't need to
0v-RpuPILX0,170400,172400,but what we do need to do is grab a
0v-RpuPILX0,172400,174800,spoon and remove about three tablespoons
0v-RpuPILX0,174800,176959,of this to save to make our basting
0v-RpuPILX0,176959,178400,sauce with
0v-RpuPILX0,178400,180560,so don't forget to do that
0v-RpuPILX0,180560,182080,and then the rest of it we can add to a
0v-RpuPILX0,182080,183440,mixing bowl
0v-RpuPILX0,183440,185040,and that is going to be the base for our
0v-RpuPILX0,185040,187920,filipino-style barbecue marinade
0v-RpuPILX0,187920,189760,oh and i should mention if you can find
0v-RpuPILX0,189760,191760,banana ketchup you could just skip this
0v-RpuPILX0,191760,193840,whole first part and just add about half
0v-RpuPILX0,193840,195760,a cup of that to this bowl
0v-RpuPILX0,195760,198080,but either way to this we will add some
0v-RpuPILX0,198080,201280,crushed garlic some brown sugar
0v-RpuPILX0,201280,203840,as well as a whole bunch of soy sauce
0v-RpuPILX0,203840,205360,in fact so much we don't even need to
0v-RpuPILX0,205360,207440,add salt to this or at least i'm not
0v-RpuPILX0,207440,208720,going to
0v-RpuPILX0,208720,210159,but we will definitely toss in some
0v-RpuPILX0,210159,212400,freshly ground black pepper
0v-RpuPILX0,212400,214000,and then the freshly squeezed juice of
0v-RpuPILX0,214000,215840,one lemon
0v-RpuPILX0,215840,217680,and that's one half
0v-RpuPILX0,217680,219440,and there's the other
0v-RpuPILX0,219440,220720,and then we will finish up with our
0v-RpuPILX0,220720,222560,other secret ingredient besides the
0v-RpuPILX0,222560,224000,banana ketchup
0v-RpuPILX0,224000,226640,which is believe it or not some seven up
0v-RpuPILX0,226640,228000,or if you want instead you could use
0v-RpuPILX0,228000,230640,sprite or if times are really tough some
0v-RpuPILX0,230640,233200,off-brand lemon-lime soda
0v-RpuPILX0,233200,234480,and that's it we'll take a whisk and
0v-RpuPILX0,234480,236239,give this a mix
0v-RpuPILX0,236239,237920,and no i guess you don't have to use the
0v-RpuPILX0,237920,239040,seven up
0v-RpuPILX0,239040,240319,okay we could just add a little more
0v-RpuPILX0,240319,242720,sugar and some lemon and lime and get
0v-RpuPILX0,242720,244080,really close
0v-RpuPILX0,244080,245680,but the risk is there's some magical
0v-RpuPILX0,245680,247680,thing the soda does that those things i
0v-RpuPILX0,247680,249360,just mentioned wouldn't do
0v-RpuPILX0,249360,251439,and why take a chance
0v-RpuPILX0,251439,252720,and that's it once we have that all
0v-RpuPILX0,252720,254799,mixed up it's ready to soak our chicken
0v-RpuPILX0,254799,255599,in
0v-RpuPILX0,255599,257040,and what i really think we want to use
0v-RpuPILX0,257040,259040,here are some nice big boneless skinless
0v-RpuPILX0,259040,260400,chicken thighs
0v-RpuPILX0,260400,262720,that i like to cut in half and as you
0v-RpuPILX0,262720,263919,know chicken thighs kind of have a
0v-RpuPILX0,263919,266240,natural division between the two sides
0v-RpuPILX0,266240,268479,and that is generally where we will cut
0v-RpuPILX0,268479,270000,but one side of a chicken thigh is a
0v-RpuPILX0,270000,272000,little bigger than the other so if you
0v-RpuPILX0,272000,273520,can kind of cheat over towards that big
0v-RpuPILX0,273520,274960,side a little bit
0v-RpuPILX0,274960,276639,in an attempt to get these pieces as
0v-RpuPILX0,276639,278720,even as possible
0v-RpuPILX0,278720,280800,and yes you can use chicken breast and
0v-RpuPILX0,280800,283280,no you shouldn't and i'll explain why on
0v-RpuPILX0,283280,284720,the grill later
0v-RpuPILX0,284720,286400,and then once our chicken's cut we'll go
0v-RpuPILX0,286400,288960,ahead and transfer it into our marinade
0v-RpuPILX0,288960,290639,at which point we'll take our tongs and
0v-RpuPILX0,290639,293280,give these a very very thorough tossing
0v-RpuPILX0,293280,295600,until every nook as well as every single
0v-RpuPILX0,295600,297919,cranny has been completely and totally
0v-RpuPILX0,297919,299040,coated
0v-RpuPILX0,299040,300479,at which point we'll toss some plastic
0v-RpuPILX0,300479,302560,over the top and we will transfer this
0v-RpuPILX0,302560,304639,into the fridge for a minimum of four
0v-RpuPILX0,304639,305600,hours
0v-RpuPILX0,305600,307199,up to overnight
0v-RpuPILX0,307199,308560,so we can do this in the morning if
0v-RpuPILX0,308560,310400,we're growing in the afternoon
0v-RpuPILX0,310400,312639,or just do before you go to bed and then
0v-RpuPILX0,312639,314080,you're pretty much ready to rock at any
0v-RpuPILX0,314080,315840,time the next day
0v-RpuPILX0,315840,317199,and then at some point while our chicken
0v-RpuPILX0,317199,319039,is marinating we can go ahead and mix up
0v-RpuPILX0,319039,321199,our basting sauce which is nothing more
0v-RpuPILX0,321199,323440,than that reserved banana ketchup
0v-RpuPILX0,323440,325759,plus some soy sauce
0v-RpuPILX0,325759,327680,some brown sugar
0v-RpuPILX0,327680,330000,a splash of vegetable oil
0v-RpuPILX0,330000,331600,and then last but not least one final
0v-RpuPILX0,331600,333039,secret ingredient
0v-RpuPILX0,333039,335600,a little bit of asian fish sauce
0v-RpuPILX0,335600,336800,and that's it we'll take a spoon and
0v-RpuPILX0,336800,338800,give this a mix
0v-RpuPILX0,338800,340160,and if you don't use fish sauce you
0v-RpuPILX0,340160,342320,could throw in a pinch of salt
0v-RpuPILX0,342320,343840,but man do you really need to start
0v-RpuPILX0,343840,345600,using fish sauce
0v-RpuPILX0,345600,347759,okay it's not the best smelling product
0v-RpuPILX0,347759,349360,but it has a proven track record for
0v-RpuPILX0,349360,350840,making food taste
0v-RpuPILX0,350840,352720,delicious and that's it once that's
0v-RpuPILX0,352720,355360,mixed up we'll simply set it aside
0v-RpuPILX0,355360,356800,and assuming our chicken's marinated
0v-RpuPILX0,356800,358639,long enough we'll pull it out and we'll
0v-RpuPILX0,358639,360000,go ahead and place those on some metal
0v-RpuPILX0,360000,361120,skewers
0v-RpuPILX0,361120,362720,or wooden skewers that we've soaked in
0v-RpuPILX0,362720,363919,water
0v-RpuPILX0,363919,365600,and my strategy here is to simply fold
0v-RpuPILX0,365600,367520,those chicken thighs in half
0v-RpuPILX0,367520,369520,with the smooth side on the outside and
0v-RpuPILX0,369520,372400,the rougher side being folded in
0v-RpuPILX0,372400,373919,and by the way you don't have to secure
0v-RpuPILX0,373919,375199,these
0v-RpuPILX0,375199,377520,you can just grill the chicken as is
0v-RpuPILX0,377520,379120,but i really do think it looks better on
0v-RpuPILX0,379120,380400,this gear
0v-RpuPILX0,380400,382080,plus it takes way less space on the
0v-RpuPILX0,382080,383520,grill
0v-RpuPILX0,383520,385600,and there are other advantages
0v-RpuPILX0,385600,387600,but two is plenty
0v-RpuPILX0,387600,388960,and in case you're keeping score at home
0v-RpuPILX0,388960,390080,this was two and a half pounds of
0v-RpuPILX0,390080,392319,chicken thighs which made three nice big
0v-RpuPILX0,392319,393440,skewers
0v-RpuPILX0,393440,394880,which should be enough to feed six
0v-RpuPILX0,394880,396560,standard humans
0v-RpuPILX0,396560,398880,or three people like me
0v-RpuPILX0,398880,400400,and that's it once those are done we can
0v-RpuPILX0,400400,402000,wrap them up and pop them back in the
0v-RpuPILX0,402000,404080,fridge until we're ready to grill
0v-RpuPILX0,404080,406000,but i am ready to grill
0v-RpuPILX0,406000,408560,so let's head out to the deck and place
0v-RpuPILX0,408560,410800,these down over some nice hot charcoal
0v-RpuPILX0,410800,412720,and it might not matter but i do like to
0v-RpuPILX0,412720,414720,start with a smooth side down
0v-RpuPILX0,414720,416160,and what i'll usually do is give this
0v-RpuPILX0,416160,418160,first side about three minutes
0v-RpuPILX0,418160,420479,at which point we'll flip them over
0v-RpuPILX0,420479,421599,and then once those have been turned
0v-RpuPILX0,421599,424479,over we will begin the basting process
0v-RpuPILX0,424479,425680,which means we're going to paint this
0v-RpuPILX0,425680,427759,side with our mixture and then in two or
0v-RpuPILX0,427759,430000,three minutes we'll turn these back over
0v-RpuPILX0,430000,432080,and we will paint the other side
0v-RpuPILX0,432080,434160,and then we will repeat that process
0v-RpuPILX0,434160,436639,basting these every time we turn until
0v-RpuPILX0,436639,439039,we've run out of basting sauce and or
0v-RpuPILX0,439039,440639,the chicken is cooked
0v-RpuPILX0,440639,442080,which depending on the size of your
0v-RpuPILX0,442080,444639,chicken and how hot your grill is it's
0v-RpuPILX0,444639,446400,probably going to take between 15 and 20
0v-RpuPILX0,446400,448639,minutes total cooking time
0v-RpuPILX0,448639,450960,oh and regarding the basting sauce that
0v-RpuPILX0,450960,452880,is sort of an optional step
0v-RpuPILX0,452880,454160,you're definitely going to have a decent
0v-RpuPILX0,454160,456160,amount of that marinade left and some
0v-RpuPILX0,456160,458400,people will simply use that to brush on
0v-RpuPILX0,458400,460160,but i do prefer that separate sauce we
0v-RpuPILX0,460160,461759,mixed up since it's a little more
0v-RpuPILX0,461759,463440,concentrated
0v-RpuPILX0,463440,465759,but anyway you decide i mean you are
0v-RpuPILX0,465759,467840,after all the enrique and glaciers of
0v-RpuPILX0,467840,470160,deciding the best way to base this
0v-RpuPILX0,470160,472400,but as i said i do prefer this method
0v-RpuPILX0,472400,474080,plus if you make the basting sauce from
0v-RpuPILX0,474080,476240,scratch and you have a little bit extra
0v-RpuPILX0,476240,477599,you can actually brush that over the
0v-RpuPILX0,477599,478720,cooked chicken
0v-RpuPILX0,478720,480240,which we can't do with the marinade
0v-RpuPILX0,480240,482000,unless we cook at first
0v-RpuPILX0,482000,484240,unless we're trying to poison someone
0v-RpuPILX0,484240,486400,in fair warning when you use a marinade
0v-RpuPILX0,486400,488160,that has sugar in it
0v-RpuPILX0,488160,489360,there is definitely going to be a good
0v-RpuPILX0,489360,490720,amount of charring
0v-RpuPILX0,490720,492639,which is fine and to a certain degree
0v-RpuPILX0,492639,494000,desirable
0v-RpuPILX0,494000,495599,but what we do want to avoid is an
0v-RpuPILX0,495599,497680,entire black surface
0v-RpuPILX0,497680,499280,and ironically to prevent that from
0v-RpuPILX0,499280,501360,happening we're applying this basting
0v-RpuPILX0,501360,503759,sauce which has sugar in it but because
0v-RpuPILX0,503759,505039,we're applying it every two or three
0v-RpuPILX0,505039,506960,minutes when we turn these we are
0v-RpuPILX0,506960,509440,actually protecting the layer underneath
0v-RpuPILX0,509440,511280,and if everything goes according to plan
0v-RpuPILX0,511280,512719,we'll definitely get some charred edges
0v-RpuPILX0,512719,514959,here and there but most of the surface
0v-RpuPILX0,514959,517279,hopefully is going to caramelize into a
0v-RpuPILX0,517279,520479,gorgeous beautiful shiny glaze
0v-RpuPILX0,520479,522000,and as you know whenever we grill on
0v-RpuPILX0,522000,523039,charcoal
0v-RpuPILX0,523039,524399,there might be some spots that are
0v-RpuPILX0,524399,525920,hotter than others
0v-RpuPILX0,525920,527440,so if you need to change the position
0v-RpuPILX0,527440,529680,these gears are in go ahead
0v-RpuPILX0,529680,532480,as well as maybe turn them 180 degrees
0v-RpuPILX0,532480,534080,just in case one side's hotter than the
0v-RpuPILX0,534080,535120,other
0v-RpuPILX0,535120,536880,or the breeze is pushing the heat to one
0v-RpuPILX0,536880,538000,side
0v-RpuPILX0,538000,539360,which is definitely something that can
0v-RpuPILX0,539360,540720,happen
0v-RpuPILX0,540720,542480,oh and that reminds me why you don't
0v-RpuPILX0,542480,544320,want to use breasts here i don't think
0v-RpuPILX0,544320,545760,right all these pieces are going to be a
0v-RpuPILX0,545760,547440,slightly different size
0v-RpuPILX0,547440,549040,so we really can't pull these off the
0v-RpuPILX0,549040,550640,grill until the biggest chunks are
0v-RpuPILX0,550640,551519,cooked
0v-RpuPILX0,551519,553519,and if we're using brass the smaller
0v-RpuPILX0,553519,555200,pieces might get dry and overcooked
0v-RpuPILX0,555200,557839,before that happens but by using thighs
0v-RpuPILX0,557839,559920,which are much more forgiving and not
0v-RpuPILX0,559920,562000,that easy to overcook we really don't
0v-RpuPILX0,562000,563360,have that issue
0v-RpuPILX0,563360,565600,plus i just think it tastes better
0v-RpuPILX0,565600,567040,but anyway like i said we'll go ahead
0v-RpuPILX0,567040,568560,and cook those for about 15 to 20
0v-RpuPILX0,568560,570800,minutes and i'm just gonna test these by
0v-RpuPILX0,570800,572480,giving them a poke
0v-RpuPILX0,572480,574080,and once they firm up and spring back to
0v-RpuPILX0,574080,576560,the touch they're usually done although
0v-RpuPILX0,576560,578480,feel free to test with a thermometer
0v-RpuPILX0,578480,579839,where you should probably go to about
0v-RpuPILX0,579839,582240,150 to 155
0v-RpuPILX0,582240,583440,and that's it we'll go ahead and pull
0v-RpuPILX0,583440,587120,those off the grill and head back inside
0v-RpuPILX0,587120,588480,and not only is this one of the most
0v-RpuPILX0,588480,590080,delicious barbecue chicken recipes you
0v-RpuPILX0,590080,591440,will ever taste
0v-RpuPILX0,591440,592880,it also has to be one of the most
0v-RpuPILX0,592880,594000,beautiful
0v-RpuPILX0,594000,595680,i mean look at that
0v-RpuPILX0,595680,596880,oh and if you have a little bit of that
0v-RpuPILX0,596880,598720,baking sauce left over go ahead and
0v-RpuPILX0,598720,600160,brush it on
0v-RpuPILX0,600160,602079,but if you don't don't worry
0v-RpuPILX0,602079,603680,i think plenty of that stuff caramelized
0v-RpuPILX0,603680,605360,on when we grilled
0v-RpuPILX0,605360,607120,and then as far as service goes i'm
0v-RpuPILX0,607120,609279,going to transfer mine onto a beautiful
0v-RpuPILX0,609279,611519,green chili rice salad
0v-RpuPILX0,611519,613279,which once i perfect the recipe i will
0v-RpuPILX0,613279,614800,show you
0v-RpuPILX0,614800,616480,oh and if there was ever a time not to
0v-RpuPILX0,616480,618240,forget to pour over the accumulated
0v-RpuPILX0,618240,620320,juices from the plate it would be this
0v-RpuPILX0,620320,621360,time
0v-RpuPILX0,621360,623920,and yes i also included some lime wedges
0v-RpuPILX0,623920,625839,mostly for the pictures
0v-RpuPILX0,625839,627279,and after taking a few of those i went
0v-RpuPILX0,627279,629920,ahead and pulled out a skewer and dug in
0v-RpuPILX0,629920,631360,and i'm not sure if it's the banana
0v-RpuPILX0,631360,633440,ketchup or the 7-up
0v-RpuPILX0,633440,634880,or all those other things we added
0v-RpuPILX0,634880,637040,working together but that my friends is
0v-RpuPILX0,637040,638640,one of the best barbecue chickens you
0v-RpuPILX0,638640,640880,will ever taste in your life
0v-RpuPILX0,640880,642640,just absolutely phenomenal in both
0v-RpuPILX0,642640,644320,flavor and texture
0v-RpuPILX0,644320,646079,and i try not to describe the taste and
0v-RpuPILX0,646079,647920,texture of a recipe by comparing it to
0v-RpuPILX0,647920,649200,other recipes
0v-RpuPILX0,649200,651440,but what this reminds me of is sort of a
0v-RpuPILX0,651440,653600,cross between a teriyaki chicken and a
0v-RpuPILX0,653600,656560,classic american style barbecue chicken
0v-RpuPILX0,656560,658880,okay it is kind of familiar and yet at
0v-RpuPILX0,658880,661120,the same time very very different which
0v-RpuPILX0,661120,662959,i think makes it very exciting and extra
0v-RpuPILX0,662959,664240,enjoyable
0v-RpuPILX0,664240,666079,and no it does not taste like bananas
0v-RpuPILX0,666079,668399,and no it is not too sweet right there's
0v-RpuPILX0,668399,669760,definitely a little bit of fruitiness
0v-RpuPILX0,669760,670640,there
0v-RpuPILX0,670640,672640,playing off the citrus
0v-RpuPILX0,672640,674480,but as far as the sweetness goes i think
0v-RpuPILX0,674480,677120,it's nicely balanced with the acidity
0v-RpuPILX0,677120,678800,so if you're a fan of regular barbecue
0v-RpuPILX0,678800,680959,chicken or just good old-fashioned plain
0v-RpuPILX0,680959,682720,grilled chicken i think you're going to
0v-RpuPILX0,682720,685440,be absolutely blown away by this
0v-RpuPILX0,685440,687200,which reminds me even if you're not
0v-RpuPILX0,687200,688640,going to use this in a marinade or as a
0v-RpuPILX0,688640,690480,basting sauce you should definitely whip
0v-RpuPILX0,690480,692720,up a batch of banana ketchup anyway
0v-RpuPILX0,692720,694079,and then use it for whatever you use
0v-RpuPILX0,694079,696480,ketchup for because it is some fabulous
0v-RpuPILX0,696480,698079,fabulous stuff
0v-RpuPILX0,698079,700079,and as michelle described it very
0v-RpuPILX0,700079,701440,chutney-like
0v-RpuPILX0,701440,704000,which basically is exactly what it is
0v-RpuPILX0,704000,705839,and since i did cut them up i decided to
0v-RpuPILX0,705839,707600,squeeze down a little lime
0v-RpuPILX0,707600,710160,to see how that would affect the flavor
0v-RpuPILX0,710160,711519,and it was nice
0v-RpuPILX0,711519,712800,and obviously added a little bit of
0v-RpuPILX0,712800,715440,acidity but if i'm being honest i think
0v-RpuPILX0,715440,717440,i prefer it plain
0v-RpuPILX0,717440,719680,but whether you squeeze that on or not i
0v-RpuPILX0,719680,720880,think this is one of the most
0v-RpuPILX0,720880,722560,interesting and most delicious barbecue
0v-RpuPILX0,722560,724480,chicken recipes i've ever done
0v-RpuPILX0,724480,726240,which is why i really do hope you give
