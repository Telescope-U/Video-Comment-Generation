maiv140grIw,14080,19279,redesigned 2023 honda hrv our particular
maiv140grIw,19279,22000,one is the sport trim but before we get
maiv140grIw,22000,24320,into this small size
maiv140grIw,24320,27039,crossover suv let's talk about what's
maiv140grIw,27039,28720,going on here things are definitely
maiv140grIw,28720,31679,changing in the auto industry a lot of
maiv140grIw,31679,35600,focus on electrification and full evs
maiv140grIw,35600,37680,but you know what there's still a lot of
maiv140grIw,37680,40719,people out there that want their suvs
maiv140grIw,40719,42879,but the way to buy them now there's lots
maiv140grIw,42879,46160,of different choices and honda wanted to
maiv140grIw,46160,47920,kind of touch on
maiv140grIw,47920,51120,their hrv it's kind of been left to the
maiv140grIw,51120,53199,side for a while lots of other vehicles
maiv140grIw,53199,55360,like the civic the accord they've
maiv140grIw,55360,57199,received redesigns
maiv140grIw,57199,59920,this one this is a big change and we've
maiv140grIw,59920,61840,been waiting a while for it what i want
maiv140grIw,61840,63920,to find out is has honda made the right
maiv140grIw,63920,65439,changes because what you're going to
maiv140grIw,65439,68400,find out is that this hrv is quite
maiv140grIw,68400,70880,different from the previous generation
maiv140grIw,70880,73600,not only in size but what you're getting
maiv140grIw,73600,76000,on that interior but what i want to
maiv140grIw,76000,77200,focus on
maiv140grIw,77200,82000,is this the best new small suv and also
maiv140grIw,82000,84320,show you we have a sport trim what are
maiv140grIw,84320,86479,you getting when you go the sport trim
maiv140grIw,86479,88720,so let's go ahead let's dive into our
maiv140grIw,88720,92320,urban gray metallic and find out with
maiv140grIw,92320,93680,this hrv
maiv140grIw,93680,96479,is it the one to buy that smaller size
maiv140grIw,96479,98560,right off the bat the color urban gray
maiv140grIw,98560,101840,metallic really fits the sport trim to a
maiv140grIw,101840,102960,tee and if you're wondering well how
maiv140grIw,102960,105200,many trims are there there's exactly
maiv140grIw,105200,106159,three
maiv140grIw,106159,109600,lx sport and exl let me show you what
maiv140grIw,109600,111600,makes a sport a sport first of all
maiv140grIw,111600,114079,you're going to get led headlights love
maiv140grIw,114079,116159,the way that they blacked out the
maiv140grIw,116159,119520,interior sticks with that sporty theme
maiv140grIw,119520,121360,and then you'll notice all of the
maiv140grIw,121360,123520,changes to the front end one of the
maiv140grIw,123520,125119,things i actually like about this
maiv140grIw,125119,127600,mid-trim is the flat black so you're
maiv140grIw,127600,129920,going to get flat black and the lower
maiv140grIw,129920,131120,corners
maiv140grIw,131120,133440,that's going to help house the corner
maiv140grIw,133440,135520,air intakes for the air curtains and
maiv140grIw,135520,137680,then you'll see how everything really
maiv140grIw,137680,140400,has a nice angular look without being
maiv140grIw,140400,143520,too over the top coming across the front
maiv140grIw,143520,146080,of the business what makes this a sport
maiv140grIw,146080,149840,this grill is specific to the sport trim
maiv140grIw,149840,152560,same flat satin black i love the way
maiv140grIw,152560,154640,it's fully functional and then on the
maiv140grIw,154640,157519,lower side you got more functionality
maiv140grIw,157519,159360,and look at the way you have that flat
maiv140grIw,159360,160879,black lip
maiv140grIw,160879,163680,not only to try to stop air from going
maiv140grIw,163680,166000,underneath but also to give it that
maiv140grIw,166000,168400,sporty look here's a little interesting
maiv140grIw,168400,171200,fun fact out of the three trims
maiv140grIw,171200,172319,lx
maiv140grIw,172319,175840,sport and exl this one has the most
maiv140grIw,175840,179440,ground clearance 7.3 inches the other
maiv140grIw,179440,181680,ones have seven inches of ground
maiv140grIw,181680,182879,clearance so you're going to get a
maiv140grIw,182879,185760,little bit more space underneath this
maiv140grIw,185760,188720,hrv now when you get up onto the hood
maiv140grIw,188720,191519,everything is going to show that nice
maiv140grIw,191519,193440,smooth design going towards the
maiv140grIw,193440,194879,windshield
maiv140grIw,194879,197360,it's a balance and it's tough because in
maiv140grIw,197360,199920,this smaller suv everything has like a
maiv140grIw,199920,201599,cutesy look to it
maiv140grIw,201599,203680,this definitely shows a little bit more
maiv140grIw,203680,206560,maturity over the previous gen and the
maiv140grIw,206560,208879,sport has some nice touches on the front
maiv140grIw,208879,210560,end now when we come around the bend
maiv140grIw,210560,212799,what are we working with wheel and tire
maiv140grIw,212799,215040,setup out of all the different trims for
maiv140grIw,215040,216640,this vehicle
maiv140grIw,216640,218480,this has the largest wheels so you're
maiv140grIw,218480,221040,actually getting an 18 inch wheel rather
maiv140grIw,221040,223280,than a 17 inch wheel and if you're
maiv140grIw,223280,225920,wondering what's the size 225 on the
maiv140grIw,225920,229360,width 55 series sidewall i like that
maiv140grIw,229360,231840,nice sort of like v-spoke design all the
maiv140grIw,231840,233760,way around gloss black
maiv140grIw,233760,236239,there is flat black around the fender
maiv140grIw,236239,238080,openings but the great news is compared
maiv140grIw,238080,239200,to other
maiv140grIw,239200,242159,new suvs the smaller suvs in this class
maiv140grIw,242159,244080,it's not so high you look at a mazda
maiv140grIw,244080,246480,cx-30 it like it comes all the way up to
maiv140grIw,246480,247599,the hood
maiv140grIw,247599,250480,tastefully done flat black now when we
maiv140grIw,250480,252959,go down the side sport trim you're also
maiv140grIw,252959,254480,going to get your gloss black mirror
maiv140grIw,254480,255680,caps
maiv140grIw,255680,257600,makes sense because we got the gloss
maiv140grIw,257600,260320,black wheels no sunroof
maiv140grIw,260320,262000,if you want a sunroof you're going to
maiv140grIw,262000,264400,have to pony up some extra dough and
maiv140grIw,264400,267440,you're going to have to go with the exl
maiv140grIw,267440,269919,but you have gloss black gloss black on
maiv140grIw,269919,272479,the wheels flat black all the way along
maiv140grIw,272479,274880,the bottom i'm so glad they didn't do
maiv140grIw,274880,277520,flat black door handles we got actual
maiv140grIw,277520,280000,color matched door handles that urban
maiv140grIw,280000,282720,gray metallic the other new color which
maiv140grIw,282720,284639,guess what stay tuned for the first
maiv140grIw,284639,287040,drive that's going to be coming up june
maiv140grIw,287040,289919,21st at 9 00 a.m eastern time we have
maiv140grIw,289919,292400,the other new color on an exl called
maiv140grIw,292400,293360,nordic
maiv140grIw,293360,295759,forest pearl but let's continue on this
maiv140grIw,295759,298320,sport working our way towards the rear
maiv140grIw,298320,299759,everything with the design you can see
maiv140grIw,299759,301360,the extra length we're talking about
maiv140grIw,301360,303039,nine inches guys
maiv140grIw,303039,305600,could you imagine nine inches you get it
maiv140grIw,305600,309199,with your honda hrv coming all the way
maiv140grIw,309199,310960,about around the back
maiv140grIw,310960,312479,lori's gonna have to try to watch out
maiv140grIw,312479,315759,for the mud and the deep dirt here at
maiv140grIw,315759,317360,portland oregon but
maiv140grIw,317360,320000,nice gloss black on the roof spoiler
maiv140grIw,320000,322400,that's part of the sport trim i like the
maiv140grIw,322400,326240,way it extends out and what i also like
maiv140grIw,326240,328720,is that it houses the third brake light
maiv140grIw,328720,330960,so that cleans up the look you do have a
maiv140grIw,330960,332720,wiper but at this price point i'm not
maiv140grIw,332720,334720,going to zonk it the other great news is
maiv140grIw,334720,336880,you could have a front-wheel drive hrv
maiv140grIw,336880,340320,or like ours all-wheel drive to get the
maiv140grIw,340320,342320,power to the ground just like the
maiv140grIw,342320,344560,headlights they did a sporty look with
maiv140grIw,344560,347360,the tail lights especially the led
maiv140grIw,347360,349520,lighting hrv now what they should have
maiv140grIw,349520,351840,done was this should be black this
maiv140grIw,351840,353360,should be black so that's gonna be a
maiv140grIw,353360,356400,zonk because look on our sport badge
maiv140grIw,356400,358319,they did the black so if you're gonna go
maiv140grIw,358319,359600,full sport
maiv140grIw,359600,362560,give me matching badges and then all the
maiv140grIw,362560,365919,way down if you like an exhaust tip this
maiv140grIw,365919,368800,is the only trim sport trim is the only
maiv140grIw,368800,371520,one that has a single exhaust on one
maiv140grIw,371520,373759,side the others you can't even see the
maiv140grIw,373759,375280,exhaust which is okay
maiv140grIw,375280,377520,but i would like to see it balance one
maiv140grIw,377520,379600,on each side let me know how you feel
maiv140grIw,379600,381280,about that in the comments section but
maiv140grIw,381280,383360,you got the flat black and a little bit
maiv140grIw,383360,385360,of silverish gray on the bottom but
maiv140grIw,385360,387360,while we go ahead we talked about the
maiv140grIw,387360,388800,exterior let's pop the hood and see
maiv140grIw,388800,390240,what's powering our sport all right guys
maiv140grIw,390240,392080,we got the hood popped underneath that
maiv140grIw,392080,395120,hood what's powering our hrv there's
maiv140grIw,395120,397280,only one engine choice and you know what
maiv140grIw,397280,399440,i think they made a smart decision with
maiv140grIw,399440,401759,what engine we have it's a two liter
maiv140grIw,401759,404960,naturally aspirated inline four 158
maiv140grIw,404960,408319,horsepower 138 pound-feet of torque it
maiv140grIw,408319,409039,is
maiv140grIw,409039,411759,mated to a cvt so we're going to have to
maiv140grIw,411759,414800,zonk that but honda has claimed that
maiv140grIw,414800,417199,they went through the whole transmission
maiv140grIw,417199,419840,and re-tuned it with the ecu to be a
maiv140grIw,419840,421599,little bit more engaging
maiv140grIw,421599,423840,front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive
maiv140grIw,423840,424960,you're going to get some pretty good
maiv140grIw,424960,426319,mileage i'm going to stick with our
maiv140grIw,426319,427680,all-wheel drive since that's what we
maiv140grIw,427680,431759,have 25 in the city 30 on the highway
maiv140grIw,431759,435120,and this vehicle weighs around 30 200
maiv140grIw,435120,437840,pounds i guess the other big thing that
maiv140grIw,437840,439199,has changed for this that's going to
maiv140grIw,439199,441280,help with that sporty drive is going to
maiv140grIw,441280,443440,be the independent rear suspension but
maiv140grIw,443440,446800,while we go ahead let's fire up our hrv
maiv140grIw,446800,449230,sport and hear what it sounds like
maiv140grIw,449230,458279,[Music]
maiv140grIw,469440,472240,all right guys we're inside this 2023
maiv140grIw,472240,473599,hrv
maiv140grIw,473599,476560,sport now remember this is right in the
maiv140grIw,476560,479280,sweet spot of the trims starting trim is
maiv140grIw,479280,480560,lx
maiv140grIw,480560,483440,obviously top trim is exl
maiv140grIw,483440,485759,if you're saying to yourself well joe
maiv140grIw,485759,489199,i'm really liking this hrv but price at
maiv140grIw,489199,490879,the end of the day is what's going to
maiv140grIw,490879,492479,direct my decision
maiv140grIw,492479,494400,how much is this sport well let me put
maiv140grIw,494400,497120,in perspective for you lx has a starting
maiv140grIw,497120,499520,price of around 23 000
maiv140grIw,499520,503039,and if you want the fully loaded e x l
maiv140grIw,503039,506960,that has a price at almost 29 000
maiv140grIw,506960,508479,this sport
maiv140grIw,508479,512159,slots in right in the middle at 25 000
maiv140grIw,512159,514159,so let's see what the sport brings
maiv140grIw,514159,516399,that's different than the other trims to
maiv140grIw,516399,518399,the door panels you're gonna get the
maiv140grIw,518399,521839,same simple clean design and i like it
maiv140grIw,521839,524800,soft touch up top the big change on the
maiv140grIw,524800,527360,sport is the orange stitching
maiv140grIw,527360,530880,orange to honda means sport means racing
maiv140grIw,530880,532399,and that's what you're going to get no
maiv140grIw,532399,533839,gloss black
maiv140grIw,533839,536000,i like the ripple effect you see that
maiv140grIw,536000,538399,water ripple effect on the door panel
maiv140grIw,538399,540080,give it a little bit of extra style
maiv140grIw,540080,542399,without going too over the top door
maiv140grIw,542399,544240,pocket is the zonk
maiv140grIw,544240,545839,maybe
maiv140grIw,545839,548640,maybe a chipmunk burrito
maiv140grIw,548640,551839,and a bottle of mountain water to wash
maiv140grIw,551839,553680,it down now going from the door panel to
maiv140grIw,553680,555839,the dash i do like the way they didn't
maiv140grIw,555839,558560,go cheap on the materials soft touch you
maiv140grIw,558560,560720,got that wire mesh finish
maiv140grIw,560720,562320,just like you found in what other
maiv140grIw,562320,566320,vehicle yes the honda civic on the sport
maiv140grIw,566320,569120,you get bigger wheels but on the sport
maiv140grIw,569120,571839,you get a smaller infotainment system
maiv140grIw,571839,574560,this is your seven inch infotainment
maiv140grIw,574560,578240,system lx and sport have seven inches if
maiv140grIw,578240,580640,you want the big nine inch then what
maiv140grIw,580640,582160,you're going to have to do is step up to
maiv140grIw,582160,585279,exl it is a touch screen so you can
maiv140grIw,585279,587600,actually scroll here through the stereo
maiv140grIw,587600,589200,channels
maiv140grIw,589200,592000,but besides that everything else is done
maiv140grIw,592000,593680,through your buttons so you could go
maiv140grIw,593680,595760,into your menu you could toggle up and
maiv140grIw,595760,597839,down like this and make your adjustments
maiv140grIw,597839,600800,but it's a very simplistic unit on the
maiv140grIw,600800,602000,sport
maiv140grIw,602000,603839,backup camera
maiv140grIw,603839,606160,it's poor resolution not the greatest
maiv140grIw,606160,608480,you do have trajectory and i do like the
maiv140grIw,608480,611440,way you could adjust the camera angle
maiv140grIw,611440,614160,that to me is very smart but
maiv140grIw,614160,616959,i wish on the sport it had the option of
maiv140grIw,616959,619040,a nine inch system put it back in the
maiv140grIw,619040,619920,park
maiv140grIw,619920,621680,and then you hit menu and we're right
maiv140grIw,621680,623680,back where we started you got your
maiv140grIw,623680,625920,orange stitching all the way across
maiv140grIw,625920,628480,bright red on the engine start stop

maiv140grIw,632000,633360,exl
maiv140grIw,633360,636240,but you only have your standard ac
maiv140grIw,636240,638000,controls so you're going to have your
maiv140grIw,638000,640720,temperature on one side your mode on the
maiv140grIw,640720,643200,other and blower fan speed and the
maiv140grIw,643200,646399,center and the the sport has gloss black
maiv140grIw,646399,648720,knobs instead of silver
maiv140grIw,648720,652240,down below you could easily fit four
maiv140grIw,652240,654399,to eight twinkies depending on how high
maiv140grIw,654399,656959,you like to stack your twinkies me i
maiv140grIw,656959,658720,like to keep it single stack because i
maiv140grIw,658720,660880,don't like to double up on my cream
maiv140grIw,660880,662399,usb a
maiv140grIw,662399,665279,easily accessible two cup holders

maiv140grIw,669760,672079,enter a race pretty soon at
maiv140grIw,672079,673920,portland international raceway what's
maiv140grIw,673920,675760,nice is you have remote start so that's
maiv140grIw,675760,677920,a nice touch on the sport this guy right
maiv140grIw,677920,680240,here is going to control your cvt
maiv140grIw,680240,682399,transmission love the way they brought
maiv140grIw,682399,684079,the stitching this is something the
maiv140grIw,684079,685839,other manufacturers have to learn that
maiv140grIw,685839,688079,if you're going to go orange put orange
maiv140grIw,688079,691120,everywhere not just on the door panels i
maiv140grIw,691120,693440,do like the little pass through
maiv140grIw,693440,695760,you and your friend can play handsies
maiv140grIw,695760,698240,your passenger could play handsies or
maiv140grIw,698240,699920,what you could do is you could actually
maiv140grIw,699920,702000,fill this up with skittles because
maiv140grIw,702000,703920,that'll allow you to taste the rainbow
maiv140grIw,703920,705839,that maybe you'll see here after it
maiv140grIw,705839,709360,rains in portland i got a usbc
maiv140grIw,709360,712560,and another usbc so we got usbcs you got
maiv140grIw,712560,714880,your drive mode selector switch all soft
maiv140grIw,714880,717120,touch electric e-brake
maiv140grIw,717120,719360,more soft touch on the armrest
maiv140grIw,719360,721279,and orange stitching
maiv140grIw,721279,723200,open it up what can you put in there i
maiv140grIw,723200,725680,would say about
maiv140grIw,725680,727920,maybe six oranges because we got orange
maiv140grIw,727920,729920,stitching we they said if you're going
maiv140grIw,729920,732079,to mention a fruit joe you got to say
maiv140grIw,732079,735040,orange so you could get your vitamin c
maiv140grIw,735040,736639,and you could fit about six oranges but
maiv140grIw,736639,738079,here's a little fun fact that maybe you
maiv140grIw,738079,739120,didn't know
maiv140grIw,739120,741360,strawberries have more vitamin c than
maiv140grIw,741360,743200,oranges
maiv140grIw,743200,744399,mind blown
maiv140grIw,744399,747680,seats sport equals cloth we got the
maiv140grIw,747680,750160,orange it is grippy i do like this
maiv140grIw,750160,753279,textured design they got going on manual
maiv140grIw,753279,755360,seat controls for the passenger but
maiv140grIw,755360,757200,guess what you got nothing to brag about
maiv140grIw,757200,759040,over here on the driver's side because i
maiv140grIw,759040,762320,got manual seats as well the sport comes
maiv140grIw,762320,764800,with the black headlighter i do like
maiv140grIw,764800,766639,that and you can see how much head room
maiv140grIw,766639,768639,i have
maiv140grIw,768639,770800,just no no sunroof so if you want a
maiv140grIw,770800,772480,sunroof you're going to have to get a
maiv140grIw,772480,776240,saw a saw a saw and just cut a big hole
maiv140grIw,776240,777600,opening in there
maiv140grIw,777600,779360,and then maybe get some saran wrap to
maiv140grIw,779360,780560,cover it up but why don't you come over
maiv140grIw,780560,781760,here to the business end i want to show
maiv140grIw,781760,783920,you behind the wheel orange stitched
maiv140grIw,783920,786560,wheel of this hi guys business time one
maiv140grIw,786560,788160,thing that's a little bit of a bummer is
maiv140grIw,788160,790000,that the sport doesn't have any aluminum
maiv140grIw,790000,792720,pedals nothing like that and you got the
maiv140grIw,792720,794959,manual seat control so to adjust your
maiv140grIw,794959,797360,seat height you pull on this bad boy and
maiv140grIw,797360,799360,then of course you can adjust the back
maiv140grIw,799360,801519,the seats are comfortable i actually
maiv140grIw,801519,802480,think they're a little bit more
maiv140grIw,802480,805760,comfortable than the top exl trim if
maiv140grIw,805760,807440,that makes sense
maiv140grIw,807440,808880,just keeps blowing my mind here on
maiv140grIw,808880,811600,radies rides steering wheel like i said
maiv140grIw,811600,813600,they did it right with the orange
maiv140grIw,813600,815920,stitching all the way around
maiv140grIw,815920,818160,simple on the buttons it is a manual
maiv140grIw,818160,820560,tilting and telescoping steering wheel
maiv140grIw,820560,824079,soft touch soft touch orange orange
maiv140grIw,824079,825680,what do we got for a dash you're going
maiv140grIw,825680,827440,to have that small digital display with
maiv140grIw,827440,829839,your tachometer on the other side you
maiv140grIw,829839,832079,got an analog speedometer
maiv140grIw,832079,833519,and then you're going to toggle through
maiv140grIw,833519,836079,the three different modes that are
maiv140grIw,836079,837600,available to you
maiv140grIw,837600,839760,obviously snow is with that all-wheel
maiv140grIw,839760,842399,drive system no head up display but you
maiv140grIw,842399,843920,know what i don't think you're going to
maiv140grIw,843920,846000,need that especially at this price point
maiv140grIw,846000,848079,25 000
maiv140grIw,848079,849920,i think they brought finishes that
maiv140grIw,849920,852160,really kind of elevate the feel but why
maiv140grIw,852160,854000,don't we get into the back seat
maiv140grIw,854000,855600,and speaking of feelings let's see if
maiv140grIw,855600,857279,your passengers are going to get their
maiv140grIw,857279,859440,feelings hurt if you have to give them a
maiv140grIw,859440,861600,ride in your hrv let's go see what
maiv140grIw,861600,863360,they're going to find hi guys backseat
maiv140grIw,863360,865519,time i'm telling you it's like they
maiv140grIw,865519,868639,actually took the previous hrv
maiv140grIw,868639,870800,and added an air pump to the body and
maiv140grIw,870800,873120,then pumped it up to make it larger
maiv140grIw,873120,874959,because there's tons of room back here
maiv140grIw,874959,877519,i'm still six feet tall and i'm not
maiv140grIw,877519,879600,touching the headliner now the thing is
maiv140grIw,879600,882000,you got cloth all the way around no
maiv140grIw,882000,884000,pocket so if you're going to have you
maiv140grIw,884000,886560,know your mountain climbing gear maybe
maiv140grIw,886560,888560,some rope maybe some
maiv140grIw,888560,890480,cleats that you wear there's nothing
maiv140grIw,890480,891920,that you can slide back here so you're
maiv140grIw,891920,893519,going to have to use the cargo space so
maiv140grIw,893519,895839,fingers crossed that has enough room
maiv140grIw,895839,897199,back there
maiv140grIw,897199,899680,here's the biggest mystery of all
maiv140grIw,899680,902000,what is the purpose of that
maiv140grIw,902000,904160,i have no idea i guess what you could do
maiv140grIw,904160,906800,is is you could get one of those old
maiv140grIw,906800,909199,like three or four inch
maiv140grIw,909199,911839,tvs that you were portable back in the
maiv140grIw,911839,913839,1980s and keep it here and you could
maiv140grIw,913839,916480,watch like channel 3 pbs and watch
maiv140grIw,916480,918000,sesame street or something but there's
maiv140grIw,918000,920639,no rear ac and there's no connectivity
maiv140grIw,920639,923440,so they don't even give you two freaking
maiv140grIw,923440,925680,cans and a piece of string to talk to
maiv140grIw,925680,926720,somebody
maiv140grIw,926720,928480,of course it would have to be orange
maiv140grIw,928480,930800,string now the great news is i got my
maiv140grIw,930800,932959,own pocket and look at this you could
maiv140grIw,932959,935040,easily put i would say
maiv140grIw,935040,936480,22
maiv140grIw,936480,938160,pine cones in here
maiv140grIw,938160,940880,official portland pine cones they
maiv140grIw,940880,943519,actually call them the double peas
maiv140grIw,943519,945120,put those back here
maiv140grIw,945120,946800,seats though i'm telling you the cloth
maiv140grIw,946800,949519,feels good i'm digging that you know if
maiv140grIw,949519,951440,you want some type of adjustability
maiv140grIw,951440,954000,there isn't any plus there's no center
maiv140grIw,954000,957360,armrest but they did give us the orange
maiv140grIw,957360,959120,stitching
maiv140grIw,959120,961839,and the same material as up front but
