5rgTFHoO6oY,54510,57153,"lower yields make it really, really easy to,"

5rgTFHoO6oY,61110,63270,that a lot of these tech stocks will have.
5rgTFHoO6oY,63270,64980,"- [Narrator] In 2012 and 2013,"

5rgTFHoO6oY,79470,82410,"steadily grew over the decade as money poured in,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,82410,85170,outpacing growth in other industries.
5rgTFHoO6oY,85170,88619,"As revenue grew, companies also expanded their workforces."

5rgTFHoO6oY,96090,98369,"tech was at the forefront of the stock market,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,98370,99810,with a bull run being driven

5rgTFHoO6oY,102270,104820,- 2010s were really the decade of disruption
5rgTFHoO6oY,104820,106500,"for a lot of these tech stocks,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,106500,109260,"we really started to be on our phones longer,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,109260,111420,"we started going on social media,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,111420,113220,and all these factors combined
5rgTFHoO6oY,113220,116190,"really, really increased the allure of tech stock,"

5rgTFHoO6oY,117960,118920,- [Narrator] Low interest rates
5rgTFHoO6oY,118920,120330,and increased smartphone use

5rgTFHoO6oY,122310,124350,- Those two factors combined together
5rgTFHoO6oY,124350,127740,"really made it easy to just sort of go into the tech trade,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,127740,129360,and really led to the valuations
5rgTFHoO6oY,129360,130860,of a lot of these tech companies
5rgTFHoO6oY,130860,133200,"to become really inflated, really lofty."

5rgTFHoO6oY,150150,151739,"- When the pandemic first started,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,151740,153210,"we had all these lockdowns,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,153210,156150,"we had travel restrictions, and people were stuck at home."
5rgTFHoO6oY,156150,157920,So what do you do when you're stuck at home?
5rgTFHoO6oY,157920,160470,"You go online, and you binge watch shows on Netflix."
5rgTFHoO6oY,160470,162420,"You wanna talk to your friends, you go to Zoom."
5rgTFHoO6oY,162420,163319,"- [Narrator] At the same time,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,163320,166140,Washington enacted a massive stimulus plan.
5rgTFHoO6oY,166140,167190,The government sent out
5rgTFHoO6oY,167190,169860,"more than 150 million stimulus checks,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,169860,171030,and the fed made plans
5rgTFHoO6oY,171030,173610,to lend billions of dollars across markets.
5rgTFHoO6oY,173610,176760,- We have held our policy rate near zero since mid-March
5rgTFHoO6oY,176760,178590,and have stated that we will keep it there
5rgTFHoO6oY,178590,180090,until we are confident
5rgTFHoO6oY,180090,182459,that the economy has weathered recent events
5rgTFHoO6oY,182460,185130,and is on track to achieve our maximum employment

5rgTFHoO6oY,186990,189510,"- The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,189510,192000,and they were historically ultra low.
5rgTFHoO6oY,192000,194370,"And that made it also very, very easy"
5rgTFHoO6oY,194370,196870,"for a lot of these tech companies to take on cash,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,198060,199410,to borrow more money.
5rgTFHoO6oY,199410,201060,It lowered their borrowing costs.
5rgTFHoO6oY,201060,203640,"So yeah, that altogether really helped tech stocks"
5rgTFHoO6oY,203640,207330,get to the levels they were at in 2020 and 2021.
5rgTFHoO6oY,207330,209220,"- [Narrator] As stimulus flooded the economy,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,209220,211170,market cap prices for tech leaders
5rgTFHoO6oY,211170,214530,"like Amazon, Apple, and Meta reached new records."
5rgTFHoO6oY,214530,216870,Some companies significantly grew their workforces
5rgTFHoO6oY,216870,218099,"to meet rising demand,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,218100,220560,announcing increased hiring during earnings calls

5rgTFHoO6oY,234570,237000,"flashed a warning sign to some analysts,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,237000,239730,who speculated that companies might not be able to keep up
5rgTFHoO6oY,239730,241620,with the exploding growth.
5rgTFHoO6oY,241620,244500,Inflation was beginning to take center stage.
5rgTFHoO6oY,244500,247020,"- We had Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,247020,247987,"come in and say that,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,247987,250207,"""Yeah, okay, we're now going to start thinking"
5rgTFHoO6oY,250207,252817,"""about raising rates to fight inflation,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,252817,255510,"""because it seems like it isn't temporary anymore."""
5rgTFHoO6oY,255510,258120,- High inflation is a severe threat
5rgTFHoO6oY,258120,259769,"to the achievement of maximum employment,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,259769,262139,into achieving a long expansion that can give us that.
5rgTFHoO6oY,262140,265050,"- And that's sent investors absolutely freaking out,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,265050,267030,panicking about these tech companies.
5rgTFHoO6oY,267030,268920,- [Narrator] Share prices for small tech companies
5rgTFHoO6oY,268920,271590,and giants alike started to slip.
5rgTFHoO6oY,271590,274410,"While inflation supply, chain issues, and the war in Ukraine"
5rgTFHoO6oY,274410,276540,"were impacting businesses around the world,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,276540,279570,tech was being faced with other unique challenges.
5rgTFHoO6oY,279570,282570,"Ad revenue, which social media companies like Snap,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,282570,285720,"Twitter, and Facebook rely on, has taken a hit"
5rgTFHoO6oY,285720,288870,as inflation led companies to spend less on advertising.
5rgTFHoO6oY,288870,291330,And apple introduced a privacy feature last year
5rgTFHoO6oY,291330,293159,"that restricts user tracking,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,293160,294900,which means that sites have a harder time
5rgTFHoO6oY,294900,296490,targeting ads to users.
5rgTFHoO6oY,296490,298860,Companies now had to redesign their ad targeting
5rgTFHoO6oY,298860,301650,and tracking tools to comply with the new rules.
5rgTFHoO6oY,301650,304139,"And by doing so, lost business."
5rgTFHoO6oY,304140,306810,Meta estimated that Apple's ad-tracking changes
5rgTFHoO6oY,306810,310260,would cost the company $10 billion this year.
5rgTFHoO6oY,310260,312720,Another issue that caused earnings to take a tumble
5rgTFHoO6oY,312720,314730,is changing consumer behaviors.
5rgTFHoO6oY,314730,316800,"- So, previously, we were all at home,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,316800,318840,"ordering stuff online again,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,318840,321720,"and now, we're shifting back and going back in person,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,321720,323190,we're going to restaurants.
5rgTFHoO6oY,323190,324600,We're going to stores.
5rgTFHoO6oY,324600,326490,"- [Narrator] Companies are looking to cut costs,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,326490,328889,having expanded when growth was booming.
5rgTFHoO6oY,328890,330790,"In a shareholder meeting, Meta said that-"
5rgTFHoO6oY,330790,333030,"- [David] Given the resulting revenue headwinds,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,333030,334020,we have adjusted our plans
5rgTFHoO6oY,334020,335759,for hiring and expense growth this year.
5rgTFHoO6oY,335760,337830,- [Narrator] Carvana CEO said in an email
5rgTFHoO6oY,337830,340560,"that they would cut around 2,500 workers."

5rgTFHoO6oY,344160,346260,- [Vlad] The time we thought that this was right
5rgTFHoO6oY,346260,348780,"to keep up with the pace of the business,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,348780,353780,"but it also led to some inefficiency, some redundant roles."
5rgTFHoO6oY,355260,356520,- [Narrator] Stocks have dropped quickly
5rgTFHoO6oY,356520,359789,amid poor earnings results and the slowdown in growth.
5rgTFHoO6oY,359790,362760,"Now, some investors are bailing on volatile tech stocks"
5rgTFHoO6oY,362760,364260,as interest rates rise.
5rgTFHoO6oY,364260,366570,- So tech companies also include
5rgTFHoO6oY,366570,369660,"some of the most speculative companies in the market,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,369660,371190,and riskier ones as well.
5rgTFHoO6oY,371190,372960,"So it makes it really, really hard for you"
5rgTFHoO6oY,372960,375930,to justify owning something that's not gonna be profitable
5rgTFHoO6oY,375930,377850,for a long time in the future to come.
5rgTFHoO6oY,377850,378683,- [Narrator] It's unclear
5rgTFHoO6oY,378683,380460,where the market might go from here.
5rgTFHoO6oY,380460,383220,- Analyst and investors right now remain divided
5rgTFHoO6oY,383220,386100,about whether this slowdown is going to be temporary
5rgTFHoO6oY,386100,387180,or permanent.
5rgTFHoO6oY,387180,388410,- [Narrator] And not all tech companies
5rgTFHoO6oY,388410,389970,have been hit as hard.
5rgTFHoO6oY,389970,391020,IBM and Citrix
5rgTFHoO6oY,391020,393780,"have both continued to outperform the declining market,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,393780,394980,but with the Federal Reserve
5rgTFHoO6oY,394980,396990,"expected to steeply raise interest rates,"
5rgTFHoO6oY,396990,400345,analysts say tech stocks will continue to suffer.
