WLoPNgIp6go,19439,22880,start here and draw a big circle oh i'm
WLoPNgIp6go,22880,25840,going to go over it again and you can
WLoPNgIp6go,25840,28240,press lightly so that it's easier to
WLoPNgIp6go,28240,31119,erase at the very end
WLoPNgIp6go,31119,33200,and you can go back over it until you
WLoPNgIp6go,33200,36719,get the shape just the way you want it
WLoPNgIp6go,36719,38800,and then if you have extra lines you can
WLoPNgIp6go,38800,41200,erase those so that you don't get
WLoPNgIp6go,41200,43280,confused with which line you want to
WLoPNgIp6go,43280,45840,keep
WLoPNgIp6go,48559,50320,remember to pause the video if you need
WLoPNgIp6go,50320,51520,extra time
WLoPNgIp6go,51520,53760,now let's draw the inside of our donut
WLoPNgIp6go,53760,56079,i'm going to draw another circle that's
WLoPNgIp6go,56079,57440,smaller
WLoPNgIp6go,57440,59520,in the center

WLoPNgIp6go,61680,63920,go back over it i'm pressing hard but
WLoPNgIp6go,63920,65840,you can press softly so it's easier to

WLoPNgIp6go,67840,70159,general shape of our donut let's switch
WLoPNgIp6go,70159,72960,to our marker next and now we can add
WLoPNgIp6go,72960,75920,all of the details to our unicorn donut
WLoPNgIp6go,75920,78240,or turn it into a unicorn donut let's
WLoPNgIp6go,78240,80799,first start by drawing a bow i'm going
WLoPNgIp6go,80799,82560,to draw it right here i'm going to draw
WLoPNgIp6go,82560,85119,the center of the bow i'll cut it you
WLoPNgIp6go,85119,87280,could draw a circle or kind of a square
WLoPNgIp6go,87280,89520,shape
WLoPNgIp6go,91200,93200,then let's draw a
WLoPNgIp6go,93200,94960,diagonal line coming out of the left and
WLoPNgIp6go,94960,97040,also the right
WLoPNgIp6go,97040,98560,and then we could also draw a diagonal
WLoPNgIp6go,98560,102479,line coming out on the bottom too
WLoPNgIp6go,103759,106479,then let's connect the top down to the
WLoPNgIp6go,106479,109360,bottom on the left and also on the right
WLoPNgIp6go,109360,112240,oh we could also add two little wrinkle
WLoPNgIp6go,112240,115360,lines on the inside
WLoPNgIp6go,115360,117840,now let's draw our donuts hair

WLoPNgIp6go,123840,124960,come up
WLoPNgIp6go,124960,128920,down and then back up
WLoPNgIp6go,131520,133200,then right here we could draw the bottom
WLoPNgIp6go,133200,136080,of the hair coming down across and then
WLoPNgIp6go,136080,139840,connect over here to this side
WLoPNgIp6go,141520,143599,let's add the funny face next i'm going

WLoPNgIp6go,146480,149840,underneath the hair
WLoPNgIp6go,150160,151840,and we could also draw a little tongue
WLoPNgIp6go,151840,153920,sticking out to the side if you want but
WLoPNgIp6go,153920,156319,you could change your face too and add

WLoPNgIp6go,161920,164239,same size circle for the right eye you
WLoPNgIp6go,164239,166560,could change it so that maybe one eye is
WLoPNgIp6go,166560,168640,winking or closed
WLoPNgIp6go,168640,170720,or both of them are closed i like that
