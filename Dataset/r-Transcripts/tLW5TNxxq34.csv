tLW5TNxxq34,240,2320,it's ford vs subaru in a test hill
tLW5TNxxq34,2320,4319,battle royale which is the better
tLW5TNxxq34,4319,6480,all-wheel drive system it's an epic
tLW5TNxxq34,6480,8880,compact crossover competition on this
tLW5TNxxq34,8880,11660,episode of driving sports tv
tLW5TNxxq34,11660,28320,[Music]
tLW5TNxxq34,28320,30080,today at the test hill we have a pair of
tLW5TNxxq34,30080,32320,compact crossovers that are more alike
tLW5TNxxq34,32320,33520,than different
tLW5TNxxq34,33520,36160,they have similar wheel bases both have
tLW5TNxxq34,36160,38800,advanced off-road capabilities and both
tLW5TNxxq34,38800,41760,have the word sport on their trunk lids
tLW5TNxxq34,41760,45120,this is the 2021 ford bronco sport in
tLW5TNxxq34,45120,47360,top end first edition trim
tLW5TNxxq34,47360,48800,not to be confused with the larger
tLW5TNxxq34,48800,51840,bronco the sport is small but it still
tLW5TNxxq34,51840,54559,packs in big features the model we're
tLW5TNxxq34,54559,56320,testing includes the off-road ready
tLW5TNxxq34,56320,59039,badlands package this includes falcon
tLW5TNxxq34,59039,62640,wild peak at3w all-terrain tires a stout
tLW5TNxxq34,62640,65280,2-liter ecoboost engine good for 250
tLW5TNxxq34,65280,67920,peak horsepower and an advanced twin
tLW5TNxxq34,67920,70560,clutch rear drive unit with differential
tLW5TNxxq34,70560,71600,lock
tLW5TNxxq34,71600,73280,as you see it here you're looking at
tLW5TNxxq34,73280,75920,forty thousand and ninety us dollars
tLW5TNxxq34,75920,78080,including destination
tLW5TNxxq34,78080,80799,the competition today is a 2021 subaru
tLW5TNxxq34,80799,83040,crosstrek sport this comes with the
tLW5TNxxq34,83040,84799,largest engine option you can get in a
tLW5TNxxq34,84799,87439,subaru crosstrek it's a 2.5 liter
tLW5TNxxq34,87439,89439,naturally aspirated boxer 4 that puts
tLW5TNxxq34,89439,92320,out up to 182 horsepower
tLW5TNxxq34,92320,94079,the sport has subaru symmetrical
tLW5TNxxq34,94079,96240,all-wheel drive with enhanced dual
tLW5TNxxq34,96240,97840,function x mode
tLW5TNxxq34,97840,99680,because this is one of my personal cars
tLW5TNxxq34,99680,101680,we are able to upgrade the tires to
tLW5TNxxq34,101680,104240,better match the ford unfortunately you
tLW5TNxxq34,104240,107439,cannot buy falcon wild peak at-3ws in
tLW5TNxxq34,107439,109840,the stock crosstrek size
tLW5TNxxq34,109840,111840,instead we went with the more pedestrian
tLW5TNxxq34,111840,114640,falcon wild peak trail tires
tLW5TNxxq34,114640,116719,these have similar compounds but a less
tLW5TNxxq34,116719,118399,aggressive tread pattern
tLW5TNxxq34,118399,120000,throwing in an extra thousand dollars
tLW5TNxxq34,120000,122000,for the tire upgrade the crosstrek as
tLW5TNxxq34,122000,124000,you see it here is twenty nine thousand
tLW5TNxxq34,124000,126079,six hundred and fifty five dollars
tLW5TNxxq34,126079,127680,including destination
tLW5TNxxq34,127680,130000,even including the tires it's still 11
tLW5TNxxq34,130000,132640,000 less than the ford
tLW5TNxxq34,132640,134239,today we're gonna run the gauntlet
tLW5TNxxq34,134239,136160,putting each of these capable crossovers
tLW5TNxxq34,136160,140080,through every course on our test hill
tLW5TNxxq34,140080,141840,so this first test is what we call
tLW5TNxxq34,141840,143760,garter whey this is a very simple
tLW5TNxxq34,143760,146879,incline with side to side power transfer
tLW5TNxxq34,146879,149280,getting us up and this vehicle equipped
tLW5TNxxq34,149280,150160,with
tLW5TNxxq34,150160,153920,wild peak at3ws should make it
tLW5TNxxq34,153920,155360,pretty easily
tLW5TNxxq34,155360,157120,let's talk about vehicle setup here
tLW5TNxxq34,157120,159200,shall we because we're not just gonna
tLW5TNxxq34,159200,161840,jump right into this let's start with
tLW5TNxxq34,161840,164560,goat mode completely off i have nothing
tLW5TNxxq34,164560,165599,enabled and we'll see what the
tLW5TNxxq34,165599,168080,difference is
tLW5TNxxq34,168080,170959,and away we go
tLW5TNxxq34,170959,174239,this is extremely loose dirt i don't
tLW5TNxxq34,174239,176000,think ryan intended it to be that way
tLW5TNxxq34,176000,178159,when he built this but
tLW5TNxxq34,178159,179440,in a second you'll see what's going to
tLW5TNxxq34,179440,180720,start happening
tLW5TNxxq34,180720,182000,the rear
tLW5TNxxq34,182000,183840,differential which has torque vectoring
tLW5TNxxq34,183840,185840,should push power left and right to help
tLW5TNxxq34,185840,188400,propel me up the hill
tLW5TNxxq34,188400,190800,oh it's a really soft hill
tLW5TNxxq34,190800,194720,can we see power moving around outside
tLW5TNxxq34,194720,196400,maybe okay i think we're gonna have to
tLW5TNxxq34,196400,198239,lock
tLW5TNxxq34,198239,200879,i'm gonna lock the uh rear differential
tLW5TNxxq34,200879,202480,it hasn't been locked yet see if there's
tLW5TNxxq34,202480,204879,a difference
tLW5TNxxq34,207519,208959,and i'm just keeping the throttle down
tLW5TNxxq34,208959,213280,is it gonna pull us up
tLW5TNxxq34,213280,214400,i think i'm going to actually have to
tLW5TNxxq34,214400,216640,turn on the goat mode okay so i'm going
tLW5TNxxq34,216640,218480,to switch over to
tLW5TNxxq34,218480,220480,rock crawl all right oh wait let's not
tLW5TNxxq34,220480,221840,do rock hall let's do sam because this
tLW5TNxxq34,221840,223440,stuff's really small that's better yeah
tLW5TNxxq34,223440,225120,so i'm going to back up now typically
tLW5TNxxq34,225120,227120,sand modes with these
tLW5TNxxq34,227120,229680,what they do is actually allow for a lot
tLW5TNxxq34,229680,232080,of wheel spin because you need to move
tLW5TNxxq34,232080,234080,your way through the sand so let's try
tLW5TNxxq34,234080,235200,this again
tLW5TNxxq34,235200,236640,all right
tLW5TNxxq34,236640,240519,so we got take two here
tLW5TNxxq34,243840,245360,do you need to give it a little more i
tLW5TNxxq34,245360,247280,think i made the car the i think i made
tLW5TNxxq34,247280,249360,the course too hard
tLW5TNxxq34,249360,252480,this is supposed to be the easy course
tLW5TNxxq34,252480,254080,like digging
tLW5TNxxq34,254080,256639,i don't think ryan intended this track
tLW5TNxxq34,256639,258720,to be this hard but there's just so much
tLW5TNxxq34,258720,260560,loose dirt it's really
tLW5TNxxq34,260560,262000,ah
tLW5TNxxq34,262000,263919,once you get over the rise it makes it
tLW5TNxxq34,263919,266080,up but boy that was a struggle
tLW5TNxxq34,266080,268680,and that was with the
tLW5TNxxq34,268680,273040,at-3ws which are the most extreme tire
tLW5TNxxq34,273040,274000,oof
tLW5TNxxq34,274000,275840,so the subaru
tLW5TNxxq34,275840,276639,well
tLW5TNxxq34,276639,278639,let's jump into the subaru and we'll
tLW5TNxxq34,278639,279919,discuss it
tLW5TNxxq34,279919,281840,so before we even get started it's you
tLW5TNxxq34,281840,283360,got to really understand these are
tLW5TNxxq34,283360,285360,different tires they're both wild peaks
tLW5TNxxq34,285360,288160,the bronco has the more aggressive at3 w
tLW5TNxxq34,288160,290639,this one has the trails which are more
tLW5TNxxq34,290639,293199,your everyday tire but they are still
tLW5TNxxq34,293199,294840,all terrains they're just not as
tLW5TNxxq34,294840,297520,aggressive the broncos board did chew up
tLW5TNxxq34,297520,299280,the course a little bit we've tried to
tLW5TNxxq34,299280,301199,fill in some of the holes so we'll see
tLW5TNxxq34,301199,303440,how this does i was just going to drive
tLW5TNxxq34,303440,304320,up
tLW5TNxxq34,304320,305759,but i'm not going to i'm going to keep
tLW5TNxxq34,305759,308240,it in snow dirt mode with x mode so
tLW5TNxxq34,308240,310400,that's x mode type one what that does is
tLW5TNxxq34,310400,312720,it gives a more aggressive mapping in
tLW5TNxxq34,312720,314000,how
tLW5TNxxq34,314000,316639,it does break vectoring to shift power
tLW5TNxxq34,316639,318720,around the system
tLW5TNxxq34,318720,322320,so as i go and as wheels slip
tLW5TNxxq34,322320,324400,it'll put a brake on one wheel which
tLW5TNxxq34,324400,325919,then redistributes power to the other
tLW5TNxxq34,325919,328320,wheels
tLW5TNxxq34,329039,331199,however when there's no grip oh i did
tLW5TNxxq34,331199,333280,just keep the throttle in
tLW5TNxxq34,333280,337080,okay i'm just digging holes
tLW5TNxxq34,340800,343360,can i get over the rise ah
tLW5TNxxq34,343360,344639,no
tLW5TNxxq34,344639,346160,now i have to be careful here this is
tLW5TNxxq34,346160,348000,really soft so i can easily dig a hole
tLW5TNxxq34,348000,350320,that's too deep and then i'm basically
tLW5TNxxq34,350320,353520,going to high center or scrape the nose
tLW5TNxxq34,353520,354639,so we're just going to do with a little
tLW5TNxxq34,354639,356400,more speed here
tLW5TNxxq34,356400,358560,and note i have not aired down any tires
tLW5TNxxq34,358560,360240,yet that is not something that we're
tLW5TNxxq34,360240,363120,allowed to do on manufacturers cars
tLW5TNxxq34,363120,364800,like this is my own personal car so i
tLW5TNxxq34,364800,366400,could do it on this car but
tLW5TNxxq34,366400,368319,i want it to be fair
tLW5TNxxq34,368319,370720,and this subaru does have the exact same
tLW5TNxxq34,370720,373199,or almost the same ground clearance as
tLW5TNxxq34,373199,375120,the broncos sport does oh he's actually
tLW5TNxxq34,375120,378080,not doing too bad
tLW5TNxxq34,379680,382240,he's digging in in the back
tLW5TNxxq34,382240,384800,okay and he's nope
tLW5TNxxq34,384800,386080,i was going to say he's made it up but
tLW5TNxxq34,386080,388319,not quite yet
tLW5TNxxq34,388319,391280,and it made it up
tLW5TNxxq34,391360,393440,that was tough
tLW5TNxxq34,393440,395840,in my mind when i designed this course i
tLW5TNxxq34,395840,397759,was thinking uh that it would compact
tLW5TNxxq34,397759,399680,because of rain or something like that
tLW5TNxxq34,399680,402080,it doesn't rain here ever so it's
tLW5TNxxq34,402080,404160,basically just like silt
tLW5TNxxq34,404160,405919,uh because of that yeah i'm going to
tLW5TNxxq34,405919,408000,give the wind to the bronco and it's
tLW5TNxxq34,408000,410479,mostly because of the tires it does have
tLW5TNxxq34,410479,412400,more advanced off-road kit yeah we're
tLW5TNxxq34,412400,414080,going to get more into that on the next
tLW5TNxxq34,414080,415280,course because now we're going to take
tLW5TNxxq34,415280,418639,them to the rattler
tLW5TNxxq34,419039,420479,now the point of this one is it's a lot
tLW5TNxxq34,420479,422319,of rocks and they're big rocks four by
tLW5TNxxq34,422319,423759,four four by eights you know kind of
tLW5TNxxq34,423759,426400,they're all pretty large and we position
tLW5TNxxq34,426400,427680,them in a way that we're really going to
tLW5TNxxq34,427680,431039,test approach break over departure and
tLW5TNxxq34,431039,433039,articulation
tLW5TNxxq34,433039,435440,i'm going to go ahead and set this into
tLW5TNxxq34,435440,437280,rock crawl mode because it has such a
tLW5TNxxq34,437280,439360,mode let's use it
tLW5TNxxq34,439360,441199,and rock crawl will automatically lock
tLW5TNxxq34,441199,442880,the four wheel drive system which uses a
tLW5TNxxq34,442880,446240,clutch pack and will also lock that rear
tLW5TNxxq34,446240,448720,differential this should make it as
tLW5TNxxq34,448720,450400,easy as possible
tLW5TNxxq34,450400,452160,to go over this and i'm really actually
tLW5TNxxq34,452160,454400,the crawl ratio on this is quite nice i
tLW5TNxxq34,454400,456960,am barely moving along now it's not a
tLW5TNxxq34,456960,458720,wrangler but it's not supposed to have
tLW5TNxxq34,458720,460639,them straighten out
tLW5TNxxq34,460639,461599,okay
tLW5TNxxq34,461599,463680,continue straight oh you're good
tLW5TNxxq34,463680,465840,right there right there okay we've got
tLW5TNxxq34,465840,466800,over
tLW5TNxxq34,466800,468879,how we looking carlina yeah you're fine
tLW5TNxxq34,468879,471039,you have
tLW5TNxxq34,471039,472160,about
tLW5TNxxq34,472160,473360,one inch or more
tLW5TNxxq34,473360,475919,more than that you got about six inches
tLW5TNxxq34,475919,477759,of clearance
tLW5TNxxq34,477759,479759,so far he has
tLW5TNxxq34,479759,481759,no wheels off
tLW5TNxxq34,481759,483360,i'm feeling pretty confident in this i
tLW5TNxxq34,483360,484160,mean
tLW5TNxxq34,484160,486080,the suspension is really soaking up
tLW5TNxxq34,486080,488160,these rocks nicely i'm feeling like the
tLW5TNxxq34,488160,490000,system is fairly confident you do get
tLW5TNxxq34,490000,493199,wheel spin because that is the nature of
tLW5TNxxq34,493199,496000,these systems and these crossovers
tLW5TNxxq34,496000,497759,it's not like
tLW5TNxxq34,497759,499840,you know in the big bronco you have a
tLW5TNxxq34,499840,501599,transfer case and that will like
tLW5TNxxq34,501599,503120,physically lock the front and the back
tLW5TNxxq34,503120,504479,this isn't the same thing it uses a
tLW5TNxxq34,504479,508960,clutch pack and it uses lots of logic
tLW5TNxxq34,509280,511120,doing good i think that one worked
tLW5TNxxq34,511120,513599,pretty well yeah yeah it was easy was
tLW5TNxxq34,513599,516080,smooth how'd the line look it was good
tLW5TNxxq34,516080,517839,you didn't kick up any rocks you also
tLW5TNxxq34,517839,518800,didn't
tLW5TNxxq34,518800,520479,have any wheels that popped up from
tLW5TNxxq34,520479,521839,whatever how was the wheel spinning was
tLW5TNxxq34,521839,523120,there a lot of wheel spinning or just a
tLW5TNxxq34,523120,525279,little bit only a little bit on your
tLW5TNxxq34,525279,526640,driver's side great so the brake
tLW5TNxxq34,526640,528480,vectoring did a good job of reducing
tLW5TNxxq34,528480,529680,wheel spin because you don't want too
tLW5TNxxq34,529680,531440,much on rocks
tLW5TNxxq34,531440,533360,now the subaru does not have a rock
tLW5TNxxq34,533360,535200,crawl mode it has x mode but it doesn't
tLW5TNxxq34,535200,538160,have x mode rock crawl not a thing so
tLW5TNxxq34,538160,539680,it'll be interesting to see how that
tLW5TNxxq34,539680,541600,deals with this tricky situation
tLW5TNxxq34,541600,543200,definitely all right i think you got it
tLW5TNxxq34,543200,545680,from here yeah
tLW5TNxxq34,545680,548320,so the bronco did a really good job of
tLW5TNxxq34,548320,550720,having a fairly decent crawl speed for
tLW5TNxxq34,550720,553279,not having a low range it also did a
tLW5TNxxq34,553279,554880,really good job of keeping the wheels
tLW5TNxxq34,554880,556880,from spinning aggressively you start
tLW5TNxxq34,556880,558320,getting aggressive wheel spin that's
tLW5TNxxq34,558320,560320,when you can get into trouble on rocks
tLW5TNxxq34,560320,563120,now subaru relies on wheel spin before
tLW5TNxxq34,563120,564959,it clamps down and uses brake vectoring
tLW5TNxxq34,564959,567040,to shift power around so
tLW5TNxxq34,567040,569760,i have my concerns
tLW5TNxxq34,569760,572800,there is significant difference here
tLW5TNxxq34,572800,575279,and this car is capable of so many
tLW5TNxxq34,575279,577120,things but i don't know if this is going
tLW5TNxxq34,577120,578880,to be too much for those of you who
tLW5TNxxq34,578880,580640,don't watch the show all the time yes i
tLW5TNxxq34,580640,583120,do own this car it's also the car that
tLW5TNxxq34,583120,585760,my wife drives every day so if i break
tLW5TNxxq34,585760,587760,it i'm busted
tLW5TNxxq34,587760,589440,i am going to go ahead and prep the car
tLW5TNxxq34,589440,591920,by putting it in snow dirt mode i don't
tLW5TNxxq34,591920,593680,want deep snow because that will give
tLW5TNxxq34,593680,595760,more wheel spin i actually want less
tLW5TNxxq34,595760,597279,wheel spin i kind of wish there was a
tLW5TNxxq34,597279,599440,rock crawl mode here so that it would
tLW5TNxxq34,599440,600399,really
tLW5TNxxq34,600399,602880,prevent the wheels from spinning because
tLW5TNxxq34,602880,605920,if we move a rock it is possible that we
tLW5TNxxq34,605920,606880,could
tLW5TNxxq34,606880,608560,uh break something
tLW5TNxxq34,608560,611200,so the approach here
tLW5TNxxq34,611200,613120,now there's no underbody protection on
tLW5TNxxq34,613120,614880,this car
tLW5TNxxq34,614880,616640,all right so the subaru i'm actually
tLW5TNxxq34,616640,618560,gonna hop down a little sooner because
tLW5TNxxq34,618560,620240,the subaru has a front lip that hangs a
tLW5TNxxq34,620240,622800,little lower than the bronco sport so
tLW5TNxxq34,622800,624720,you got to be extra careful i'm going to
tLW5TNxxq34,624720,626000,help him
tLW5TNxxq34,626000,627680,line up
tLW5TNxxq34,627680,630480,straighten out his line a bit perfect
tLW5TNxxq34,630480,631600,okay
tLW5TNxxq34,631600,632880,and
tLW5TNxxq34,632880,635279,i'm gonna see oh we got some rear oh
tLW5TNxxq34,635279,637040,massive tire spin i'm gonna move back
tLW5TNxxq34,637040,639120,just make sure i'm safe i'm gonna have
tLW5TNxxq34,639120,641680,to uh use a little more momentum so with
tLW5TNxxq34,641680,644320,the subaru unfortunately it doesn't have
tLW5TNxxq34,644320,645440,a
tLW5TNxxq34,645440,648800,rock crawl mode so he's struggling here
tLW5TNxxq34,648800,650240,a little bit
tLW5TNxxq34,650240,652480,just digging in
tLW5TNxxq34,652480,655680,i don't see any tire lift currently but
tLW5TNxxq34,655680,660120,he's just digging himself a hole
tLW5TNxxq34,660959,663360,okay he's now chosen a different line
tLW5TNxxq34,663360,665360,yep this one's a little bit easier for
tLW5TNxxq34,665360,666399,him oh
tLW5TNxxq34,666399,668959,he's got lift on that passenger side now
tLW5TNxxq34,668959,672160,and he's just spinning
tLW5TNxxq34,672160,675920,digging it okay let's go into x mode
tLW5TNxxq34,675920,677680,type 2 and see if that improves the
tLW5TNxxq34,677680,681399,situation at all
tLW5TNxxq34,688320,690959,got over it
tLW5TNxxq34,691440,694240,now the next one
tLW5TNxxq34,695839,697519,that wheel spin the fact that this is
tLW5TNxxq34,697519,700560,based on wheel spin makes it really bad
tLW5TNxxq34,700560,703200,for rocks i am not terribly comfortable
tLW5TNxxq34,703200,704320,doing this
tLW5TNxxq34,704320,706720,even with the
tLW5TNxxq34,706720,709040,falcon wild peak trails which are a
tLW5TNxxq34,709040,711440,little more rugged than a standard
tLW5TNxxq34,711440,712560,oe
tLW5TNxxq34,712560,714880,street tire they are not
tLW5TNxxq34,714880,716480,like extreme because you can get
tLW5TNxxq34,716480,717600,different
tLW5TNxxq34,717600,721040,levels of extreme on these things
tLW5TNxxq34,721040,723279,well we made it through but i have to
tLW5TNxxq34,723279,726320,say the bronco sport did it much better
tLW5TNxxq34,726320,727600,that was
tLW5TNxxq34,727600,731319,that was a little nerve-wracking
tLW5TNxxq34,731519,733120,well the bronco really just breezed
tLW5TNxxq34,733120,736000,through the track the super not so much
tLW5TNxxq34,736000,738240,yeah i can take a look at this and i am
tLW5TNxxq34,738240,740320,just this is a mess compared to what we
tLW5TNxxq34,740320,742240,built yeah yeah subaru just kicked
tLW5TNxxq34,742240,744639,things all over the place and i do
tLW5TNxxq34,744639,746000,believe
tLW5TNxxq34,746000,747680,i have built this course to be too
tLW5TNxxq34,747680,749360,difficult for
tLW5TNxxq34,749360,751360,crossovers this is
tLW5TNxxq34,751360,753360,this is gonna damage some cars and i'm
tLW5TNxxq34,753360,755519,not comfortable with that so
tLW5TNxxq34,755519,757519,this course is gonna have to get redone
tLW5TNxxq34,757519,759120,i think before we start bringing more
tLW5TNxxq34,759120,760800,crossovers out here
tLW5TNxxq34,760800,762399,we do have another test to do here
tLW5TNxxq34,762399,765040,though we have the sidewinder now the
tLW5TNxxq34,765040,766959,sidewinder has one
tLW5TNxxq34,766959,768720,section that
tLW5TNxxq34,768720,771120,foils everything but the most
tLW5TNxxq34,771120,773760,competent off-road machines
tLW5TNxxq34,773760,775040,so we're not going to do that we have a
tLW5TNxxq34,775040,777760,bypass because we're going to skip that
tLW5TNxxq34,777760,780639,this is a course that includes crosscut
tLW5TNxxq34,780639,782399,followed by some logs which is then
tLW5TNxxq34,782399,784880,followed by a steep climb put it into
tLW5TNxxq34,784880,786160,rock crawl because we don't want too
tLW5TNxxq34,786160,788240,much wheel spin too much wheel spin can
tLW5TNxxq34,788240,789760,actually kick up a log and that's a
tLW5TNxxq34,789760,791519,problem putting it into rock mode
tLW5TNxxq34,791519,794160,automatically locks the center clutch
tLW5TNxxq34,794160,797600,and also locks the rear differential so
tLW5TNxxq34,797600,801079,away we go
tLW5TNxxq34,801120,802720,now the first thing is a cross cut which
tLW5TNxxq34,802720,804480,is going to remove traction
tLW5TNxxq34,804480,806639,because one wheel is going to dip in and
tLW5TNxxq34,806639,809519,the other one is not
tLW5TNxxq34,809519,810880,i'm also going to turn on the front
tLW5TNxxq34,810880,812399,camera here which i love that this
tLW5TNxxq34,812399,815920,vehicle has and that'll help me with my
tLW5TNxxq34,815920,818320,line
tLW5TNxxq34,826240,828240,how you doing doing well how about
tLW5TNxxq34,828240,831279,yourself doing good good yeah
tLW5TNxxq34,831279,833519,okay now this last log here usually this
tLW5TNxxq34,833519,835199,is problematic
tLW5TNxxq34,835199,836959,again a little wheel spin here you can
tLW5TNxxq34,836959,838480,see power shuffle around but then it
tLW5TNxxq34,838480,839199,gets
tLW5TNxxq34,839199,840800,it gets grip
tLW5TNxxq34,840800,842639,it just does such a good job this this
tLW5TNxxq34,842639,844000,bronco sport i don't think people
tLW5TNxxq34,844000,846000,realize just what a good little
tLW5TNxxq34,846000,848160,off-roader this vehicle is ford just did
tLW5TNxxq34,848160,851040,an amazing job with this thing and yeah
tLW5TNxxq34,851040,852480,you're gonna spend the money on it to
tLW5TNxxq34,852480,854399,get all the goodies this thing is 40
tLW5TNxxq34,854399,855920,grand now you don't have to spend that
tLW5TNxxq34,855920,858800,much of course to get a capable bronco
tLW5TNxxq34,858800,860959,sport
tLW5TNxxq34,860959,862240,but you're going to pay still pretty
tLW5TNxxq34,862240,863920,close to that i mean keep in mind that
tLW5TNxxq34,863920,867600,subaru is way cheaper but it is the
tLW5TNxxq34,867600,871120,best version of both vehicles
tLW5TNxxq34,871120,872399,in this class that both these
tLW5TNxxq34,872399,874399,manufacturers make so
tLW5TNxxq34,874399,877920,it is fair to a degree
tLW5TNxxq34,879760,882839,okay oh and up we
tLW5TNxxq34,882839,884639,go so
tLW5TNxxq34,884639,886720,the very first test was very much about
tLW5TNxxq34,886720,889519,tires however the next two tests really
tLW5TNxxq34,889519,891279,weren't it was more about how power is
tLW5TNxxq34,891279,893279,distributed around the system and the
tLW5TNxxq34,893279,895279,broncos sport here is just simply
tLW5TNxxq34,895279,897839,superior to the subaru setup now if you
tLW5TNxxq34,897839,900079,do get a more entry-level bronco sport
tLW5TNxxq34,900079,902399,with the all-wheel drive system you will
tLW5TNxxq34,902399,904240,get a system that is not quite as
tLW5TNxxq34,904240,906079,capable as this one it's going to be
tLW5TNxxq34,906079,908480,closer to the subaru but we don't have
tLW5TNxxq34,908480,910399,one of those available so i don't know
tLW5TNxxq34,910399,913120,how good or bad it is but we will get
tLW5TNxxq34,913120,916000,one when we can it might be
tLW5TNxxq34,916000,918639,a few months
tLW5TNxxq34,920880,922480,okay now it's time for the subaru
tLW5TNxxq34,922480,924720,crosstrek sport to do the same
tLW5TNxxq34,924720,926399,now it's funny that both these vehicles
tLW5TNxxq34,926399,929199,have basically the same ground clearance
tLW5TNxxq34,929199,931759,i mean 8.8 in the broncos sport when
tLW5TNxxq34,931759,934399,equipped with the falcon wild peaks this
tLW5TNxxq34,934399,937920,one has 8.7 i mean that's pretty
tLW5TNxxq34,937920,940000,negligible
tLW5TNxxq34,940000,941839,you might look at both and say well the
tLW5TNxxq34,941839,943440,bronco sport looks like it has more
tLW5TNxxq34,943440,945360,ground clearance but the fact is it has
tLW5TNxxq34,945360,949040,more bits dangling down
tLW5TNxxq34,949040,952560,oh let's put it into uh x mode
tLW5TNxxq34,952560,954639,and i'll do it x mode snow dirt i forgot
tLW5TNxxq34,954639,956399,x mode always shuts off when you're not
tLW5TNxxq34,956399,958160,using it or you drive over a certain
tLW5TNxxq34,958160,960959,speed limit okay so he's slowly going
tLW5TNxxq34,960959,964160,over that side cut
tLW5TNxxq34,964160,965920,can't see in the back but maybe there's
tLW5TNxxq34,965920,968880,some wheel lift
tLW5TNxxq34,968880,972160,more spinning happening
tLW5TNxxq34,976240,977839,okay so he's taking it nice and easy
tLW5TNxxq34,977839,979360,over those logs once again he doesn't
tLW5TNxxq34,979360,981920,want to kick anything up okay and
tLW5TNxxq34,981920,983040,through
tLW5TNxxq34,983040,985839,is are we over it yet
tLW5TNxxq34,985839,989440,come on come on come on
tLW5TNxxq34,989839,994240,once again this dirt is just so loose
tLW5TNxxq34,994240,997519,the subaru system definitely struggled
tLW5TNxxq34,997519,1000560,however it did get through all of the
tLW5TNxxq34,1000560,1003360,courses today and i think that's pretty
tLW5TNxxq34,1003360,1005839,incredible considering the price i mean
tLW5TNxxq34,1005839,1008800,this is 28 grand and change uh and then
tLW5TNxxq34,1008800,1011600,the tires were an additional thousand
tLW5TNxxq34,1011600,1014160,dollars so you're looking at you know 29
tLW5TNxxq34,1014160,1015040,000
tLW5TNxxq34,1015040,1018720,versus 40 grand for the broncos sport
tLW5TNxxq34,1018720,1021839,that is a huge price difference but i
tLW5TNxxq34,1021839,1023920,think at the end of the day the subaru
tLW5TNxxq34,1023920,1025520,did okay
tLW5TNxxq34,1025520,1027438,but it definitely shows
tLW5TNxxq34,1027438,1029918,areas where subaru can improve
tLW5TNxxq34,1029918,1032798,like right here like so much struggling
tLW5TNxxq34,1032798,1035600,on an incline
tLW5TNxxq34,1035839,1038000,i mean why is it struggling so hard it
tLW5TNxxq34,1038000,1040079,should be more aggressive in that
tLW5TNxxq34,1040079,1041839,off-road
tLW5TNxxq34,1041839,1044720,brake vectoring
tLW5TNxxq34,1047839,1049039,ah
tLW5TNxxq34,1049039,1051520,come on you gonna get through
tLW5TNxxq34,1051520,1053120,wow i didn't know this was going to be
tLW5TNxxq34,1053120,1054720,that hard right here this is the exit of
tLW5TNxxq34,1054720,1056480,the other course
tLW5TNxxq34,1056480,1059120,did x mode shut off
tLW5TNxxq34,1059120,1061919,oh x mode shut off
tLW5TNxxq34,1061919,1064960,let's put x mode back on
tLW5TNxxq34,1064960,1066960,because we spin the spun the wheels too
tLW5TNxxq34,1066960,1069279,fast
tLW5TNxxq34,1074160,1075360,here we go come on we're going to get
tLW5TNxxq34,1075360,1076640,out of it we're going to get out of it
tLW5TNxxq34,1076640,1079200,all by ourselves because we're a big boy
tLW5TNxxq34,1079200,1082799,come on crosstrek sport you got this
tLW5TNxxq34,1082799,1086559,oh wow that was
tLW5TNxxq34,1086880,1088720,that was an interesting cherry on top
tLW5TNxxq34,1088720,1090720,wasn't it okay what we got out of it
tLW5TNxxq34,1090720,1092480,again we're able to get out of these
tLW5TNxxq34,1092480,1094880,situations maybe not as elegantly as i
tLW5TNxxq34,1094880,1096000,would like that's a little
tLW5TNxxq34,1096000,1098320,disappointment i do like these falcon
tLW5TNxxq34,1098320,1100240,wild peak trails they're pretty decent
tLW5TNxxq34,1100240,1101919,tires for
tLW5TNxxq34,1101919,1104720,mixed surface use um
tLW5TNxxq34,1104720,1107440,didn't really perform as well as
tLW5TNxxq34,1107440,1109039,i would like in some of the super soft
tLW5TNxxq34,1109039,1111919,stuff but that's kind of to be expected
tLW5TNxxq34,1111919,1113760,also you can really see the huge
tLW5TNxxq34,1113760,1116000,difference in brake vectoring versus
tLW5TNxxq34,1116000,1117840,torque vectoring in the fact that the
tLW5TNxxq34,1117840,1119760,bronco just was really able to put that
tLW5TNxxq34,1119760,1121679,power down without making such a big
tLW5TNxxq34,1121679,1123280,show about it
tLW5TNxxq34,1123280,1125440,so is the extra capability of the
tLW5TNxxq34,1125440,1127520,broncos sport worth it to you
tLW5TNxxq34,1127520,1129120,do you want to would you rather i mean
tLW5TNxxq34,1129120,1131200,40 grand on the bronco sport you could
tLW5TNxxq34,1131200,1134080,buy a 4runner for that which is bigger
tLW5TNxxq34,1134080,1136000,and more capable but if you want
tLW5TNxxq34,1136000,1137600,something small the broncos sport is
tLW5TNxxq34,1137600,1139120,still a pretty good choice
tLW5TNxxq34,1139120,1140559,like we mentioned before it's really a
tLW5TNxxq34,1140559,1142160,hard course because there's such like
tLW5TNxxq34,1142160,1144400,loose dirt and it's a new course too so
tLW5TNxxq34,1144400,1145840,it hasn't settled yet it hasn't
tLW5TNxxq34,1145840,1148240,compressed yeah we have had zero rain
tLW5TNxxq34,1148240,1150160,out here we were hoping for rain today
tLW5TNxxq34,1150160,1151679,actually i don't think it's rained out
tLW5TNxxq34,1151679,1154160,here for six months so elements are
tLW5TNxxq34,1154160,1156559,still loose and
tLW5TNxxq34,1156559,1158880,the loose is is a challenge
tLW5TNxxq34,1158880,1161280,the first course clearly the bronco did
tLW5TNxxq34,1161280,1163919,better because of the tires the second
tLW5TNxxq34,1163919,1166160,course the rattler we should have done
tLW5TNxxq34,1166160,1167919,it last i think because the changes that
tLW5TNxxq34,1167919,1169520,we made to the course we're really
tLW5TNxxq34,1169520,1171440,testing the articulation now i think it
tLW5TNxxq34,1171440,1173520,was a bit much for both vehicles
tLW5TNxxq34,1173520,1175840,actually the bronco did good it did
tLW5TNxxq34,1175840,1177679,better than the crosstrek it's a clear
tLW5TNxxq34,1177679,1179919,winner on that course and it comes down
tLW5TNxxq34,1179919,1182880,to better crawl ratio better ability to
tLW5TNxxq34,1182880,1185360,put power down without needing wheel
tLW5TNxxq34,1185360,1187280,spinning which is required for brake
tLW5TNxxq34,1187280,1190080,vectoring like in the subaru crosstreks
tLW5TNxxq34,1190080,1193200,sports symmetrical all-wheel drive the
tLW5TNxxq34,1193200,1195039,subaru it couldn't really find that
tLW5TNxxq34,1195039,1197200,traction it needed so it just dug holes
tLW5TNxxq34,1197200,1198559,which is kind of how the system is
tLW5TNxxq34,1198559,1200240,designed but you can see that there's a
tLW5TNxxq34,1200240,1202400,limitation to the design this is not a
tLW5TNxxq34,1202400,1203440,good use
tLW5TNxxq34,1203440,1206559,for that design basically yeah
tLW5TNxxq34,1206559,1209600,on the sidewinder both vehicles got up
tLW5TNxxq34,1209600,1211120,it and that's what we have to appreciate
tLW5TNxxq34,1211120,1212880,here both vehicles got up it without
tLW5TNxxq34,1212880,1215840,having to charge forth and really like
tLW5TNxxq34,1215840,1218000,just use momentum to get through it
tLW5TNxxq34,1218000,1219520,because you can use momentum but
tLW5TNxxq34,1219520,1221200,momentum doesn't tell us anything about
tLW5TNxxq34,1221200,1223039,the all-wheel drive systems that just
tLW5TNxxq34,1223039,1224799,tells us that you have a decent of
tLW5TNxxq34,1224799,1227919,enough of an approach and a breakover
tLW5TNxxq34,1227919,1229600,and i think
tLW5TNxxq34,1229600,1231360,you know the crosstrek did it and we
tLW5TNxxq34,1231360,1233440,have to give them points for that
tLW5TNxxq34,1233440,1235440,keeping in mind
tLW5TNxxq34,1235440,1238000,28 000 plus a thousand dollars in tires
tLW5TNxxq34,1238000,1239919,so 29 000
tLW5TNxxq34,1239919,1244240,versus 40 grand for the bronco sport 40
tLW5TNxxq34,1244240,1246159,grand for that little thing with the
tLW5TNxxq34,1246159,1248400,bronco sport i think you get maybe more
tLW5TNxxq34,1248400,1250080,for your money here if you really want
tLW5TNxxq34,1250080,1252880,to be able to do it all the subaru it's
tLW5TNxxq34,1252880,1254400,great for you know just a little bit
tLW5TNxxq34,1254400,1256080,off-roading going here and there and
tLW5TNxxq34,1256080,1258640,daily driver but the price for that is
tLW5TNxxq34,1258640,1260159,just so much more reasonable right the
tLW5TNxxq34,1260159,1262240,subaru all day every day but if you
tLW5TNxxq34,1262240,1264080,actually need to do the real hard stuff
tLW5TNxxq34,1264080,1265679,and you don't want to buy a forerunner
tLW5TNxxq34,1265679,1268080,you don't want to buy a big bronco
tLW5TNxxq34,1268080,1270159,that's a good option it is great for
tLW5TNxxq34,1270159,1272400,driving sports tv i'm ryan douthit
tLW5TNxxq34,1272400,1273840,i'm carlene agora thanks for watching
tLW5TNxxq34,1273840,1275679,we'll see you again real soon right here
tLW5TNxxq34,1275679,1277120,maybe i don't know where they are maybe
tLW5TNxxq34,1277120,1282039,over there maybe over there yeah see ya
