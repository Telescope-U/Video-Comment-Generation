3bOJf1bjxq0,2480,7839,and so as far as i can tell what you do  is you specify your long-term ideal
3bOJf1bjxq0,7839,13200,maybe you also specify a place you want  to stay the hell away from so that  you're terrified to fail as well as
3bOJf1bjxq0,13200,20800,excited about succeeding because that's  also useful you specify your goal you do  that you do that in some sense as a
3bOJf1bjxq0,20800,27599,unique individual you want you want to  specify goals that make you say oh if  that could happen as a consequence of my
3bOJf1bjxq0,27599,32800,efforts it would clearly be worthwhile  because  the question always is why do something
3bOJf1bjxq0,32800,39360,because doing nothing is easy you just  sit there and you don't do anything  that's real easy the question is why  would you ever do anything and the
3bOJf1bjxq0,39360,44719,answer that has to be because you've  determined by some  means that it's worthwhile and then the
3bOJf1bjxq0,44719,49920,next question might be well where should  you look for worthwhile things and one  would be well you could consult your own
3bOJf1bjxq0,49920,56320,temperament and the other would be well  you kind of look at how  look at what it is that people accrue
3bOJf1bjxq0,56320,61440,that's valuable across the lifespan  look look what so you do a structural
3bOJf1bjxq0,61440,67680,analysis of the subcomponents of human  existence and already did that  you need a family you need friends like
3bOJf1bjxq0,67680,74080,you don't need to have all these things  but you better have most of them family  friends career educational goals plans
3bOJf1bjxq0,74080,80400,for you know time outside of work  attention to your mental and physical  health etc you know those are that's
3bOJf1bjxq0,80400,86960,what life is about and if you don't have  any of those things well then all you've  got left is misery and suffering so
3bOJf1bjxq0,86960,93040,that's that's a bad  that's a bad deal for you  so
3bOJf1bjxq0,93040,99280,so once you but once you set up that  that goal structure let's say and that's  really in many in many ways that's what
3bOJf1bjxq0,99280,107200,you should be doing at universities is  that's exactly what you should be doing  is trying to figure out  who it is that you're trying to be
3bOJf1bjxq0,107200,113200,right and you  aim at that and then you use everything  you learned as a means of building that
3bOJf1bjxq0,113200,119040,person that you want to be and  and i really mean want to be i don't  mean should be even those things those
3bOJf1bjxq0,119040,124240,things are going to overlap and it's  important to distinguish between those  because that's partly and this is back
3bOJf1bjxq0,124240,130879,down to the micro routine analysis so  i'm saying well you're going to try to  make yourself more industrious okay  number one specify your damn goals
3bOJf1bjxq0,130879,136720,because how are you going to hit  something if you don't know what it is  that isn't going to happen and often  people won't specify their goals too
3bOJf1bjxq0,136720,142560,because they don't like to specify  conditions for failure so if you keep  yourself all vague and foggy which is
3bOJf1bjxq0,142560,148720,real easy because that's just a matter  of not doing as well then you don't know  when you fail  and people might say well i really don't
3bOJf1bjxq0,148720,154800,want to know when i fail because that's  painful so i'll keep myself blind about  when i fail that's fine except you'll
3bOJf1bjxq0,154800,160800,fail all the time then you just won't  know it until you've failed so badly  that you're done and that can easily
3bOJf1bjxq0,160800,167840,happen by the time you're 40.  so so  i would recommend that you don't let  that happen so that's willful blindness
3bOJf1bjxq0,167840,173920,right you could have known but you chose  not to okay so once you get your goal  structure set up you think okay if i
3bOJf1bjxq0,173920,179599,could have this life looks like that  might be worth living despite the fact  that it's going to be you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,179599,185120,anxiety provoking and threatening and  there's going to be some suffering and  loss involved in all of that obviously
3bOJf1bjxq0,185120,190560,the goal is to to have a vision for your  life such that all things considered
3bOJf1bjxq0,190560,194159,that justifies your effort
3bOJf1bjxq0,195680,201120,adopt the mode of  authentic being
3bOJf1bjxq0,201120,208319,and that is something like  refusing to participate in  the lie in deception in the lie to
3bOJf1bjxq0,208319,214799,orient your speech as much as you can  towards the truth  and to take responsibility for your own
3bOJf1bjxq0,214799,222879,life and perhaps also for the lives of  other people and there's something about  that that's  meaningful and responsible and noble but
3bOJf1bjxq0,222879,229440,also serves to mitigate the very  suffering that produces  say the nihilism or the flea into the
3bOJf1bjxq0,229440,234959,arms of flea or or the or the escape  into the arms of totalitarians to begin
3bOJf1bjxq0,234959,241360,with  you need something to shelter you  against your own vulnerability
3bOJf1bjxq0,241360,246560,you can think about  the world this way you can think about  it as your orderly little plan
3bOJf1bjxq0,246560,252000,that's a place and you can think about  it as the place that things that disrupt  your plan comes from that's another
3bOJf1bjxq0,252000,257359,place this is a bigger place than this  because there's an endless number of
3bOJf1bjxq0,257359,262880,things that can disrupt your plan and  only a tiny number of them that can  you know that will help you work it out
3bOJf1bjxq0,262880,269040,so part of the question then too is like  are you the friend of your plan are you  the friend of the thing that disrupts
3bOJf1bjxq0,269040,274560,your plan and i would say you should  work to become the friend of the thing  that disrupts your plan because there's
3bOJf1bjxq0,274560,281120,a lot of that  and then if you become the friend of the  thing that disrupts your plan then you
3bOJf1bjxq0,281120,286800,you start to develop strength in  proportion to the  to the disruptive force and that's  really what you want you want to be able
3bOJf1bjxq0,286800,293759,to implement your plan obviously but you  want to be able to  take on  the consequences of error
3bOJf1bjxq0,293759,299520,and learn from it and then then you win  constantly because even if something  goes sideways you think
3bOJf1bjxq0,299520,304800,there's something to be derived from  this  that's wisdom fundamentally
3bOJf1bjxq0,304800,311680,plan a life you'd like to have  and and you do that partly by  referring to social norms that's more or
3bOJf1bjxq0,311680,319199,less rescuing your father from the belly  of the whale but the way other way you  do that is by having a little  conversation with yourself about
3bOJf1bjxq0,319199,326160,as if you don't really know who you are  because you know what you like you won't  do what you're told you won't do what  you tell yourself to do you must have
3bOJf1bjxq0,326160,332240,noticed that it's like you're a bad  employee and a worse boss and both of  those work
3bOJf1bjxq0,332240,338320,you know for you you don't know what you  want to do and then when you tell  yourself what to do you don't do it  anyways you should fire yourself and
3bOJf1bjxq0,338320,344479,find someone else to be but  but you know what my point is is that  you have to understand that you're not
3bOJf1bjxq0,344479,350479,your own servant so to speak you're  someone that you have to negotiate with  and that's and you're someone that you
3bOJf1bjxq0,350479,355680,want to present the opportunity of  having a good life to and that's hard  for people because they don't like
3bOJf1bjxq0,355680,361440,themselves very much  so you know they're always like cracking  the whip and then procrastinating and
3bOJf1bjxq0,361440,367360,cracking the whip and then  procrastinating and it's like god it's  so boring and  such a pathetic way of spending your
3bOJf1bjxq0,367360,373680,time  i started to pay very careful attention  to  what i was saying
3bOJf1bjxq0,373680,380479,i don't know if that happened  voluntarily or involuntarily but i could  feel a sort of split developing in my  psyche and the split and i've actually
3bOJf1bjxq0,380479,386960,had students tell me the same thing has  happened to them  after they've  listened to some of the material that
3bOJf1bjxq0,386960,393120,that i've been describing to all of you  but  split into two
3bOJf1bjxq0,393120,399520,let's say  and one part was the let's say the old  me that was talking a lot
3bOJf1bjxq0,399520,405520,and that  liked to argue and that liked ideas and  there was another part that was watching
3bOJf1bjxq0,405520,411199,that part like just with its eyes open  and neutrally judging
3bOJf1bjxq0,411199,416240,and the part that was neutrally judging  was watching the part that was talking  and going
3bOJf1bjxq0,416240,421440,that isn't your idea  you don't really believe that  you don't really know what you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,421440,427120,talking about  that isn't true and i thought hmm that's  really interesting so now i've and that
3bOJf1bjxq0,427120,432240,was happening to like 95 of what i was  saying and so then i didn't really know  what to do i thought okay this is
3bOJf1bjxq0,432240,438560,strange so maybe i've fragmented and  that's just not a good thing at all i  mean it wasn't like i was hearing voices
3bOJf1bjxq0,438560,444319,or anything like that i mean it wasn't  like that  it was it was well people
3bOJf1bjxq0,444319,451840,have multiple parts  so then i had a this weird conundrum is  like  well which of those two things are me
3bOJf1bjxq0,451840,456960,is it the part that's listening and  saying no that's rubbish that's a lie
3bOJf1bjxq0,456960,462400,that's  you're doing that to impress people  you're just trying to win the argument  you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,462400,467440,was that me or was the part that was  going about my normal verbal business me
3bOJf1bjxq0,467440,474319,and i didn't know but i decided i would  go with the critic and then what i'd  tried to do what i learned to do i think
3bOJf1bjxq0,474319,480560,was to stop saying things that made me  weak  and now that i mean i'm still trying to
3bOJf1bjxq0,480560,486479,do that because i'm always  feeling when i talk  whether or not the words that i'm saying
3bOJf1bjxq0,486479,492080,are either making me align or making me  come apart  and i think the alignment i really do
3bOJf1bjxq0,492080,497360,think the alignment is i think alignment  is the right way of conceptualizing it  because i think if you say things that
3bOJf1bjxq0,497360,503840,are  as true as you can say them let's say  then they come up
3bOJf1bjxq0,503840,509440,they come out of the depths inside of  you because we don't know where thoughts  come from we don't know how far down
3bOJf1bjxq0,509440,515680,into your substructure the thoughts  emerge we don't know what processes of  physiological alignment are necessary
3bOJf1bjxq0,515680,521039,for you to speak from the core of your  being we don't understand any of that we  don't even conceptualize that but i
3bOJf1bjxq0,521039,526320,believe that you can feel that and i  learned some of that from reading carl  rogers by the way who's a great  clinician
3bOJf1bjxq0,526320,534000,uh because he talked about mental health  in part as a coherence between the  the the spiritual or the or the abstract
3bOJf1bjxq0,534000,539839,and the physical that the two things  were aligned and and there's a lot of  idea of alignment in in psychoanalytic
3bOJf1bjxq0,539839,546800,and clinical thinking  but anyways i decided that i would start  practicing not saying things that would
3bOJf1bjxq0,546800,554800,make me weak and what happened was that  i had to stop saying almost everything  that i was saying i would say 95 of it
3bOJf1bjxq0,554800,560720,as a hell of a shock to wake up and i  mean this was over a few months but it's  a hell of a shock to wake up and realize
3bOJf1bjxq0,560720,565760,that you're mostly dead wood  it's a shock
3bOJf1bjxq0,565760,571760,you know and you might think well do you  really want all of that to burn off it's  like well there's nothing left but a  little husk five percent of you it's
3bOJf1bjxq0,571760,578000,like well if that five percent is  solid  then maybe that's exactly what you want
3bOJf1bjxq0,578000,584480,to have happen  the best thing you can do is teach  people to write because there's no
3bOJf1bjxq0,584480,590640,difference between that and thinking and  one of the things that just blows me  away about universities is that
3bOJf1bjxq0,590640,596320,no one ever tells students why they  should write something it's like well  you have to do this assignment
3bOJf1bjxq0,596320,602640,well why are you writing well you need  the grade it's like no  you need to learn to think
3bOJf1bjxq0,602640,607680,because thinking makes you act  effectively in the world thinking makes  you win the battles you undertake and
3bOJf1bjxq0,607680,613519,those could be battles for good things  if you can think and speak and write you  are absolutely
3bOJf1bjxq0,613519,620000,deadly  nothing can get in your way  so that's why you learn to write it's  like
3bOJf1bjxq0,620000,625760,when i can't believe that people aren't  just told that it's it's it's like
3bOJf1bjxq0,625760,631600,it's the most powerful weapon you can  possibly provide someone with and i mean  i know lots of people who've been
3bOJf1bjxq0,631600,637040,staggeringly successful and watched them  throughout my life i mean those people  you don't want to have an argument with
3bOJf1bjxq0,637040,643360,them they'll just slash you into pieces  and they're not in a malevolent way it's  like if you're going to make your point
3bOJf1bjxq0,643360,649200,and they're going to make their point  you better have your points  organized because otherwise you are  going to look
3bOJf1bjxq0,649200,654640,like and be an absolute idiot you are  not going to get anywhere
3bOJf1bjxq0,654640,660720,and if you can formulate your arguments  coherently and make a presentation if  you can speak to people if you can lay
3bOJf1bjxq0,660720,666000,out a proposal god people give you money  they give you opportunities you have
3bOJf1bjxq0,666000,668640,influence
3bOJf1bjxq0,673760,680399,so my question was um  where do you how do you do that if you  don't know where you want to go because
3bOJf1bjxq0,680399,686640,that's kind of where i got stuck on your  your future authoring program because  okay that's that's a good question
3bOJf1bjxq0,686640,694240,that's a really good question so there's  this notion in the old testament that  morality is  following a sequence of prohibitions
3bOJf1bjxq0,694240,700000,there's a bunch of bad things you  shouldn't do and then basically you're  good enough  and and and i think there's wisdom in
3bOJf1bjxq0,700000,705040,that i think that's kind of where  children start right you  i mean i love children and all that but
3bOJf1bjxq0,705040,711440,they're they're they're crazy little  creatures and they need to be you know  civilized and well partly what you do is
3bOJf1bjxq0,711440,718320,you you lay prohibitions on them and  mostly what you're trying to do is lay  prohibitions on them
3bOJf1bjxq0,718320,723839,for the behaviors that if they  manifested would make their life  miserable so this is why this thing that
3bOJf1bjxq0,723839,729760,i've said to people has become this  crazy internet meme but that's to clean  up your room and
3bOJf1bjxq0,729760,736240,which which is a lot better and more  useful than people think it's a lot  harder too but the the thing the first  thing you do i think and i learned this
3bOJf1bjxq0,736240,742720,in part from solzhenitsyn when he was  trying to iron out his soul when he was  in the gulag because he was trying to  figure out how he got there how he
3bOJf1bjxq0,742720,748480,contributed to how he got there you know  not stella and hitler even though they  were kind of to blame you know but he
3bOJf1bjxq0,748480,755040,was much he could do about that i think  what you have to do and this is part of  humility is you have to look around you
3bOJf1bjxq0,755040,762639,within your sphere of influence like the  direct sphere of influence and fix the  things that announce themselves as in
3bOJf1bjxq0,762639,768800,need of repair and those are often small  things you know and they can be like
3bOJf1bjxq0,768800,774720,your room put it in order because the  thing is it isn't exactly so important  that your room is in order although it
3bOJf1bjxq0,774720,781600,is what's important is that you learn  how to distinguish between chaos and  order and to be able to act in a manner
3bOJf1bjxq0,781600,787680,that produces order and i think you can  you can do something as simple as just  sit on your bed and think okay there's
3bOJf1bjxq0,787680,793279,probably like five things i could do  today so that  tomorrow morning is slightly better than
3bOJf1bjxq0,793279,798639,this morning was at least or at least  i'm not falling behind and those will  usually be it's like having to eat a
3bOJf1bjxq0,798639,805839,toad in the morning right it's like it's  not going to be something you want to do  there'll be things you're trying to  avoid they're snakes essentially but if
3bOJf1bjxq0,805839,811760,you ask yourself like you're asking  someone which i think is a form of  prayer if you ask yourself instead of
3bOJf1bjxq0,811760,817440,telling yourself you know what is it  that i could do to set things more right  today
3bOJf1bjxq0,817440,824079,that i would actually do it's usually  some small thing because you're not that  disciplined you know then you can go do
3bOJf1bjxq0,824079,829440,it  and then you you put the world together  a little more when you do that
3bOJf1bjxq0,829440,837040,and that spreads out but you also put  your you also construct yourself into  something that's better able to call
3bOJf1bjxq0,837040,843040,order forth from chaos and that makes  you just incrementally stronger and then
3bOJf1bjxq0,843040,850079,the next day you can maybe take on a  slightly larger task and like you get  the benefit of compound interest if you
3bOJf1bjxq0,850079,857199,do that it's a tremendously powerful  technique and i think if you do that  at some point instead of just having to
3bOJf1bjxq0,857199,863279,fix things up that are not good you'll  start to get a glimmer of the positive  things that you could do
3bOJf1bjxq0,863279,870360,you know  the positive things that you could do  that would actually constitute a vision
3bOJf1bjxq0,871279,877120,i was 25 or so i probably weighed about  138 pounds i smoked like packed
3bOJf1bjxq0,877120,883519,cigarettes day i drank  tremendous amount of alcohol i was from  northern alberta this rough little town
3bOJf1bjxq0,883519,888560,up in northern alberta called fairview  and you know there were long winters  there and my friends were heavy drinkers
3bOJf1bjxq0,888560,894560,and most of them dropped out of school  by the time they were 15 or 16 went off  to work on the oil rigs and you know it
3bOJf1bjxq0,894560,901120,was a rough town and we drank a lot i  started when i was 14 and you know um
3bOJf1bjxq0,901120,907519,and so  i was i had a lot of bad habits let's  say and uh  things that were and i wasn't in great
3bOJf1bjxq0,907519,913279,shape physically and i was also still  intellectually obsessed by as i am now
3bOJf1bjxq0,913279,918959,and uh  so that would have been that would have  been in 85 but when i but i decided
3bOJf1bjxq0,918959,924320,around that about 85 84 something like  that maybe a little earlier that i was  really going to try to get my act
3bOJf1bjxq0,924320,930000,together  and  so i started doing that i you know i  first of all i
3bOJf1bjxq0,930000,935440,i quit smoking well that took a long  time because i eventually had to quit  drinking too in order to quit smoking
3bOJf1bjxq0,935440,942800,and i  started working out starting playing  sports which i'd never done i had a fine  time when i was a kid and but uh i
3bOJf1bjxq0,942800,948480,needed really to get disciplined and i  had to do it because  i was working on these hard problems
3bOJf1bjxq0,948480,954959,that you know that i've been discussing  with all of you and i've been working on  them really you know obsessively since
3bOJf1bjxq0,954959,960800,i was probably about 18 maybe even  earlier than that  got to the point around 25 when i was in
3bOJf1bjxq0,960800,966480,graduate school trying to get my phds  doing all my research like i published  15 papers by the time i graduated with
3bOJf1bjxq0,966480,972639,my phd which was by i think by a fairly  large measure the most papers that any  un graduate student at that time had
3bOJf1bjxq0,972639,977680,ever published at mcgill i think that's  right might have been twice as many or  maybe twice as many maybe even three
3bOJf1bjxq0,977680,982880,times as many and at the same time i  wrote maps of meaning which was a  terrible terrible
3bOJf1bjxq0,982880,988320,terribly difficult thing to do because i  was writing about three hours a day  doing that and i couldn't do all that
3bOJf1bjxq0,988320,995519,and continue with my misbehavior you  know my sort of  my  what would you say my my
3bOJf1bjxq0,995519,1000399,my hedonistic  my hedonistic
3bOJf1bjxq0,1001199,1007360,my massive hedonistic consumption of  alcohol and all of that i just couldn't  keep it up and also work seriously on
3bOJf1bjxq0,1007360,1013600,the issues that were at hand so you know  i had to stop that's a sacrifice i had  to stop
3bOJf1bjxq0,1013600,1018880,messing about and straighten myself out  you're actually tougher than you think
3bOJf1bjxq0,1018880,1024798,you never knew that and maybe you didn't  want to take on the responsibility  because you know people play a role in
3bOJf1bjxq0,1024798,1030079,their own demise so to speak when you  had opportunity to go out and explore or
3bOJf1bjxq0,1030079,1035199,withdraw because you were afraid you  chose to withdraw because you were  afraid so it's not only that you were
3bOJf1bjxq0,1035199,1041120,over protected often it's that you were  willing to take advantage of the  fact that you were over protected and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1041120,1046240,run back there whenever you had the  opportunity you know so maybe you're a  kid in the playground right and you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,1046240,1051360,having some trouble with other kids and  you know in the back of your mind i  should deal this with deal with this
3bOJf1bjxq0,1051360,1056640,myself but you go and tell your mom and  get her to intervene and you know that  that's not right you know that you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,1056640,1063120,breaking the social contract but it's  easier and so that's what you do you run  off to an authority figure and hide
3bOJf1bjxq0,1063120,1069120,behind the great father right roughly  speaking well the problem with that is  you don't learn how to do it yourself so
3bOJf1bjxq0,1069120,1074400,then you have to relearn it painfully  when you're 40.  so then you take people out
3bOJf1bjxq0,1074400,1081280,you say well what are you afraid of rank  it from 1 to 10.  so 10 is make a list of 10 things you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,1081280,1087200,afraid of the least the thing you're  least afraid of we'll call number 10.  so we'll start with that okay well i'm
3bOJf1bjxq0,1087200,1092799,afraid of elevators okay well let's  let's look at a picture of an elevator  let's have you imagine
3bOJf1bjxq0,1092799,1099200,being in an elevator let's go out to an  elevator and let you watch the terrible  jaws of death open because that's how
3bOJf1bjxq0,1099200,1105600,you're responding to it symbolically  right and you're going to do that at it  at the the closest
3bOJf1bjxq0,1105600,1112160,proximity you can manage  you find out you go do that it works  you're nervous as hell especially
3bOJf1bjxq0,1112160,1117520,from an anticipatory perspective shaking  you go out you stop you watch it happen
3bOJf1bjxq0,1117520,1122880,and you actually calm down you do that  ten times and it no longer bothers you  well what you've learned that you didn't
3bOJf1bjxq0,1122880,1129360,die but more importantly than that  you've learned that you could withstand  the threat of death that's what you've
3bOJf1bjxq0,1129360,1136160,learned  and then you move a little closer and  then you move a little closer and then  you move a little closer and finally  you're back in what's no longer the
3bOJf1bjxq0,1136160,1144880,elevator from a symbolic perspective  it's a tomb right it's it's it's a place  of enclosure and isolation and you learn
3bOJf1bjxq0,1144880,1151520,turns out i can withstand that and then  you're met much more  together much more confident and that's
3bOJf1bjxq0,1151520,1156880,often one of the things that often  happens in situations like that i've  seen this multiple times is that
3bOJf1bjxq0,1156880,1163360,if you run someone through an exposure  training process like that and and  toughen them up they'll often start
3bOJf1bjxq0,1163360,1168000,standing up to people around them in a  way they never did before
3bOJf1bjxq0,1169600,1176480,if you concentrate solely on your career  you can get a long way in your career  and i would say that that's a strategy
3bOJf1bjxq0,1176480,1184240,that a minority of men preferentially do  that that's all they do they work like  70 80 hours a week they go flat out on
3bOJf1bjxq0,1184240,1191840,their career they're staking everything  on the small probability of exceptional  status in a narrow domain but it's it's
3bOJf1bjxq0,1191840,1197200,hard on them they don't have a life it's  very difficult for them to have a family  they don't know how to take any leisure
3bOJf1bjxq0,1197200,1202400,activity like they get very  one-dimensional now it may be that that  unidimensionality is the price you have
3bOJf1bjxq0,1202400,1207600,to pay to be exceptional at one thing  right because if you're going to be  something like a genius level
3bOJf1bjxq0,1207600,1214320,mathematician and you want to do that  for or a scientist say it's like you're  in your lab you're in your lab all the
3bOJf1bjxq0,1214320,1220320,time you're working 70 hours a week or  80 hours a week you're smart you're  dedicated you're unidimensional and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1220320,1226480,that's how you get to beat all the other  people who are doing that it's the only  way but the problem is you don't get a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1226480,1233840,life now if you love being a scientist  and you have that kind of  focus of mind well first of all you're a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1233840,1239919,rare person and second you're going to  pay for it but fine more power to you  but
3bOJf1bjxq0,1239919,1246480,but  it's a  it's a risky business to do that you  sacrifice a lot for it you know and i
3bOJf1bjxq0,1246480,1251840,would say most often if you're speaking  about having a healthy life that isn't
3bOJf1bjxq0,1251840,1256880,what you do  you spread yourself out more so you know  you have a family you have some things
3bOJf1bjxq0,1256880,1262799,that you do outside of work that are  meaningful to you and useful  you you have a network of friends
3bOJf1bjxq0,1262799,1268240,um well that that those three things  alone are  four things alone or plenty to keep you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1268240,1275120,well oriented and then if one of those  things collapses  you know everything doesn't go now the
3bOJf1bjxq0,1275120,1280159,price you pay for that is the more you  strive to optimize that balance the less
3bOJf1bjxq0,1280159,1286400,likely you are to be fantastically  successful at any single one of them but  you might have a very you know if you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1286400,1292960,can consider your life as a whole  that might be a winning strategy
3bOJf1bjxq0,1297679,1303440,i had a plumber once you know  it was the night it was the night before  we were putting drywall in our house we
3bOJf1bjxq0,1303440,1309440,were redoing a house and he had put in  all the plastic piping you know and i  was going to test the joints they're
3bOJf1bjxq0,1309440,1314880,supposed to be glued together with this  pipe glue right and i said i told him i  had to test the joints and he said well
3bOJf1bjxq0,1314880,1320159,you don't have to test my joints they  never leak and i thought yeah that's  okay how about if i test them so i went
3bOJf1bjxq0,1320159,1325520,up on the third floor and filled the  pipes with water tapping them in the  basement like you're supposed to like
3bOJf1bjxq0,1325520,1331280,half an hour later i had two inches of  water in the basement there were 30  leaking joints that was the night before
3bOJf1bjxq0,1331280,1336320,the drywallers were supposed to show up  so  well so he wasn't particularly competent
3bOJf1bjxq0,1336320,1342320,that's the point of that story but even  more so he had put a bunch of the  plastic pipe outside
3bOJf1bjxq0,1342320,1347760,where the drywall would be so it would  have been sticking through the wall so i  spent a frenetic night you know sawing
3bOJf1bjxq0,1347760,1354080,through plastic pipe and re-gluing  joints so that my well so that the dry  rollers could come in what's the point
3bOJf1bjxq0,1354080,1359600,if you're going to be a plumber man be a  good plumber because otherwise all you  do is go out there and cause trouble we
3bOJf1bjxq0,1359600,1365360,don't need people to cause more trouble  we need people to solve problems you  know and so you can be a tradesman and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1365360,1373039,you can be you can make a lot of money  as a tradesperson it's a bloody reliable  honorable uh forthright productive way
3bOJf1bjxq0,1373039,1379840,of making a living and there is a hell  of a lot of difference between a working  man who knows what he's doing and one
3bOJf1bjxq0,1379840,1385520,who doesn't both in terms of skill and  ethics right and you work with someone  who knows what they're doing it's a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1385520,1390799,bloody pleasure they tell you what  they're going to do they tell you how  much it will cost they go and do it it
3bOJf1bjxq0,1390799,1396480,works and you pay them perfect  everyone's happy and that's what happens  when you have genuine hierarchies of
3bOJf1bjxq0,1396480,1403679,competence and so you listen to these  panderers of egalitarian  egalitarianism and equity and they fail
3bOJf1bjxq0,1403679,1409520,to recognize completely that there are  differences in rank between people it's  not such a terrible thing man maybe you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1409520,1416080,wouldn't be a great lawyer like it's  certainly possible most people aren't  but that doesn't mean there isn't  something you could be great at there's
3bOJf1bjxq0,1416080,1422320,lots of hierarchies to attempt to climb  and if you fail in one  go trying another but the point is
3bOJf1bjxq0,1422320,1427440,you're still trying to aim for the top  and what the hell are you going to do if  you don't try to aim for the top you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1427440,1432640,know flap about uselessly and whine  about your life it's not helpful it'll
3bOJf1bjxq0,1432640,1439039,just make you miserable you're not  reliable to anyone you can't help out in  a crisis it's like so you tell young
3bOJf1bjxq0,1439039,1444960,people and this is another message for  conservatives like i don't care what  you're going to do but go out there and  make something of yourself for god's
3bOJf1bjxq0,1444960,1451919,sake be an honest person and work and  get to the top of whatever it is that  you want to get to the top of you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,1451919,1457039,and and and and stand up for yourself  like a respectable human being and be a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1457039,1462159,bit of a light on the world instead of a  blight  you know and you can tell young people
3bOJf1bjxq0,1462159,1467919,that and they haven't been told that by  anyone now and so the young men are so  hungry for that that it's it's painful
3bOJf1bjxq0,1467919,1473520,to watch they're so relieved when  someone finally comes up and says hey  you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,1473520,1478880,you you get your act together a bit  discipline yourself see if you can learn  to tell the truth concentrate on
3bOJf1bjxq0,1478880,1485760,something for a year or two you could be  a bloody world beater they think really  that's possible wow that would be that
3bOJf1bjxq0,1485760,1494400,would be interesting that might make  life for life worth living it's like  yeah it might so why don't you go do it
3bOJf1bjxq0,1495919,1501360,that's what the damn universities were  supposed to be teaching people they've  forgotten that i went to harvard a month
3bOJf1bjxq0,1501360,1506720,ago a month and a half i used to teach  there and i talked to a bunch of  students you know and i told them
3bOJf1bjxq0,1506720,1512480,it's not easy to get into harvard you  know like you're a valedictorian if  you're at harvard and not only are you a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1512480,1519600,valedictorian you're way better than  most people at at least two other things  or you don't get in and so like it's i
3bOJf1bjxq0,1519600,1525520,don't know what the acceptance rate is  like five percent and believe me not  everybody applies so it's a very
3bOJf1bjxq0,1525520,1532640,selective school and so why am i saying  that it's like these are high quality  kids so i told them what i just told you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1532640,1539760,it's like here you are at harvard it's  like get yourself educated man read some  books learn to talk learn to think make
3bOJf1bjxq0,1539760,1546559,yourself into something get the hell out  there and make the world that put you  here happy that you were put there in
3bOJf1bjxq0,1546559,1552720,that great institution you know  and they came up to me afterwards and  said god i wish someone would have told
3bOJf1bjxq0,1552720,1557760,us that when we we're in our first year  it's like jesus why didn't someone tell
3bOJf1bjxq0,1557760,1564240,them that for god's sake it's supposed  to be the greatest university in the  world is it so difficult to figure that
3bOJf1bjxq0,1564240,1571440,out  one of the things that's really  interesting about the old testament is  that and the jews in the old testament
3bOJf1bjxq0,1571440,1576559,is that  they don't take the path of cain  every time they're walloped by god which
3bOJf1bjxq0,1576559,1583760,is like fairly frequently  they say we must have done something  wrong and we have to set ourselves right
3bOJf1bjxq0,1583760,1590400,and that's a an unbelievably heroic  attitude because  that's the alternative to cursing fate
3bOJf1bjxq0,1590400,1596400,it's like you take the responsibility  for failure onto yourself  and you think well if i was just maybe
3bOJf1bjxq0,1596400,1602799,if i just had my act together a little  bit more if i took advantage of every  opportunity that was put in front of me
3bOJf1bjxq0,1602799,1609200,if i wasn't resentful and bitter  then i could have done something that  would have tilted the situation in a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1609200,1614799,different direction and like that's  almost inevitably true dostoevsky i  think said something like every man is
3bOJf1bjxq0,1614799,1622080,responsible for everything that happens  to him and everything that happens to  everyone else  and that's you know that that's that's a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1622080,1628720,it's a crazy statement right it's a  crazy statement and he was a pretty  extreme person in many many ways but
3bOJf1bjxq0,1628720,1634880,there's a level at which that's  metaphysically true  you know because what happens is that
3bOJf1bjxq0,1634880,1640080,it's it's failure to act often that's  the most catastrophic you know i mean
3bOJf1bjxq0,1640080,1646240,i've  it's it's it's to not do the right thing  when the when the situation presents
3bOJf1bjxq0,1646240,1651840,itself and it's very specific  you know you're constantly in situations
3bOJf1bjxq0,1651840,1657919,where  you could do the right thing if you were  willing to take a risk that's actually
3bOJf1bjxq0,1657919,1663679,of relatively moderate size  and you know that you could take the  risk and you know that you should take
3bOJf1bjxq0,1663679,1669679,the risk and you don't  that happens to people all the time and  then what happens is the thing that they
3bOJf1bjxq0,1669679,1677440,didn't oppose grows a little bit  and they shrink a little bit and that  starts a loop hey
3bOJf1bjxq0,1677440,1683279,i noticed that there's always a group of  of my friends who always criticize what
3bOJf1bjxq0,1683279,1688320,i'm saying and not even um try to  understand what i'm where i'm coming
3bOJf1bjxq0,1688320,1693679,from and um i've i've always wondered  how to deal with that i mean i want to
3bOJf1bjxq0,1693679,1700240,listen to what they're saying but um  they're not understanding what i'm  they're not trying to listen to what i'm
3bOJf1bjxq0,1700240,1706640,saying so what would you do in that  situation answer that very briefly okay  there's a line in the new testament
3bOJf1bjxq0,1706640,1712320,that's relevant to that  do not cast pearls before swine
3bOJf1bjxq0,1712320,1718159,and what that means is that if people  are not listening to you  [Music]  stop talking to them
3bOJf1bjxq0,1718159,1723279,and that's really that is the best piece  of advice that i can give you and what  happens is that if you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1723279,1728480,stop talking to people who aren't  listening to you  and start watching them instead
3bOJf1bjxq0,1728480,1734240,they will tell you what they're up to  but so if you have things to say you say  them but you find people that will
3bOJf1bjxq0,1734240,1740480,listen  talk to them the ones who aren't  listening pull back  because you're you're devaluing what you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1740480,1746159,have to say by offering it to an  audience that does nothing but reject it  and that's a good guideline to life in
3bOJf1bjxq0,1746159,1750240,general so  pull back
3bOJf1bjxq0,1751279,1757039,really sad to see that people are  disenchanted and nihilistic and  depressed and anxious and aimless and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1757039,1763760,and perverse and vengeful and and all of  those things it's terrible and then to  see people
3bOJf1bjxq0,1763760,1769760,question whether that's necessary and  then to start to rise out of it it's  like it's so fun like last night i was
3bOJf1bjxq0,1769760,1774240,at after my talk it's overwhelming
3bOJf1bjxq0,1777600,1783200,i don't usually think about these things  but i was i was after my talk last night  and so all these people line up and you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1783200,1788559,know they have their 15 15 seconds with  me and they're kind of tentative they're  excited and attentive when they come up
3bOJf1bjxq0,1788559,1794880,to talk to me and then they have you  know 15 seconds of time to tell me  something i'm really listening to them  and they're hesitant about whether or
3bOJf1bjxq0,1794880,1800960,not to share the good news about their  life you know and i think it's often  because
3bOJf1bjxq0,1800960,1806640,when people share good news about their  life  people don't necessarily respond
3bOJf1bjxq0,1806640,1811679,positively you know they don't get  encouragement and people need so little
3bOJf1bjxq0,1811679,1817440,encouragement it's just unbelievable and  so they'll tell me something good and  i'm like god that's so good you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,1817440,1823679,somebody says oh i'm getting along way  better with my father i haven't seen him  for 10 years and now we get along he's  like god
3bOJf1bjxq0,1823679,1830159,great and then the power of that you  can't overstate the power of that for  individuals to get their
3bOJf1bjxq0,1830159,1836480,life together the individual is an  unbelievably powerful force and every  single person who gets their act
3bOJf1bjxq0,1836480,1843200,together a little bit has the capacity  to spread that around them it's  it's a chain reaction and so it's a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1843200,1853279,lovely thing to see  [Music]
3bOJf1bjxq0,1853279,1859279,if you're hungry and you eat well that's  good but it's over and then you're on to  the next thing right it's not exactly
3bOJf1bjxq0,1859279,1865120,sustaining it's just necessary that's  called consumatory reward by the way  this other reward system is incentive
3bOJf1bjxq0,1865120,1871600,reward and the incentive reward system  works on dopamine this neurochemical  dopamine which is also the neurochemical
3bOJf1bjxq0,1871600,1878240,tracts that opiates and cocaine and  amphetamines the drugs that people  really like to abuse alcohol often for
3bOJf1bjxq0,1878240,1883600,some people  activate and so you might say if you  don't have enough meaning in your life
3bOJf1bjxq0,1883600,1889360,then you're more prone to addiction and  that's definitely the case even with  rats if you take a rat you put him in a
3bOJf1bjxq0,1889360,1894720,cage by himself and he has nothing to do  and then you give him access to cocaine  he'll get addicted to the point where he
3bOJf1bjxq0,1894720,1901600,won't do anything but take cocaine but  if you throw the rat back in with a  bunch of other rats and he gets to do  rat things then it's very hard to get
3bOJf1bjxq0,1901600,1908320,him addicted to cocaine and so the  purposeless rat is prone to addiction  well it's the same with human beings
3bOJf1bjxq0,1908320,1914240,now here's a corollary to that which is  really cool so  the magnitude of the reward you
3bOJf1bjxq0,1914240,1919440,experience  as you're moving towards a goal is  proportionate to the importance of the
3bOJf1bjxq0,1919440,1926080,goal  so that means the more important the  goal you pick  the more possibility there is for
3bOJf1bjxq0,1926080,1931919,the kind of reward let's say it's really  a state of being that is life affirming
3bOJf1bjxq0,1931919,1936960,and it is directly life-affirming in  that you know like if you're in a  football game and you're and it's an
3bOJf1bjxq0,1936960,1942799,important football game and maybe you  break a finger and you know normally  that's that's a problem it hurts and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1942799,1949120,you're going to stop doing whatever  you're doing but if you're right in the  middle of the game  then you'll be so amped up on this
3bOJf1bjxq0,1949120,1954399,reward system that it's analgesic it  stops the pain it also suppresses  anxiety
3bOJf1bjxq0,1954399,1959600,so if you have a purpose then  it's analgesic it takes some of the pain
3bOJf1bjxq0,1959600,1964799,out of life it's very positive in that  it motivates and energizes you and  focuses you and makes you able to
3bOJf1bjxq0,1964799,1971519,remember and pay attention and it quells  fear  and so those things are all direct and
3bOJf1bjxq0,1971519,1977360,so then you might think well what's the  best possible goal well and that's  that's the purpose i would say of
3bOJf1bjxq0,1977360,1983120,religious training and philosophical  training it's like just what the hell  are you doing in the world
3bOJf1bjxq0,1983120,1990399,psychologists  have been  not all psychologists obviously but the  psychological profession is neck deep in
3bOJf1bjxq0,1990399,1996880,this in this pathology has been  beating the self-esteem drum for 50  years oh no you're okay you should feel
3bOJf1bjxq0,1996880,2003840,good about yourself like you're you're  fine the way you are it's like you think  well that's a calming message for people  it's like no it's not it's not at all
3bOJf1bjxq0,2003840,2009440,and i watch my audiences it's like it's  full of people in the audience who think  i'm suffering a lot more than i think is
3bOJf1bjxq0,2009440,2015039,tenable a whole bunch of it's my fault  my life is not in the order it should be  i know i'm doing 50 things wrong it's
3bOJf1bjxq0,2015039,2021519,like what the hell is wrong with me  what's wrong with the people around me  this is really serious and some you know  well-meaning person comes up and says
3bOJf1bjxq0,2021519,2027440,you know you're okay just the way you  are it's like no one wants that message  it's like no i'm not okay the way i am
3bOJf1bjxq0,2027440,2032480,i'm not okay at all the way i am i know  that and so you know when i'm when i'm
3bOJf1bjxq0,2032480,2038480,speaking to to when i'm speaking now i  say to people well oh you're nowhere  near what you could be that's the that's
3bOJf1bjxq0,2038480,2043600,the positive message it's like yeah  you're a mess but you don't have to stay  that way because you're a mess you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,2043600,2049040,what obviously you're suffering away  like like so much you can barely  tolerate it it's like that's okay
3bOJf1bjxq0,2049040,2054370,you could do something about it so  that's the thing that turns the lights  on it's like you could do something  about it
3bOJf1bjxq0,2054370,2061040,[Music]  if you're failing repeatedly
3bOJf1bjxq0,2061040,2066158,um  then there's probably something wrong  it's possible that there's something
3bOJf1bjxq0,2066158,2071520,wrong with the way that you're  conceptualizing the world because you  have a choice right if if you keep
3bOJf1bjxq0,2071520,2077760,making sacrifices and they don't work  there's a binary choice and one is well  there's something
3bOJf1bjxq0,2077760,2083760,wrong with the structure of reality  and the other is there's something wrong  with your approach
3bOJf1bjxq0,2083760,2089358,so then you might say well let's take  the first idea there's something wrong  with the structure of reality it's like
3bOJf1bjxq0,2089358,2094878,you're really going to say that are you  you're really going to come out and say  i know enough to judge the nature of
3bOJf1bjxq0,2094878,2100640,being  and  and then the alternative is also quite  frightening because then you know you
3bOJf1bjxq0,2100640,2107280,it's you that's making the mistakes and  you might be wrong at a really deep  level and that might mean that a lot of  you has to burn off
3bOJf1bjxq0,2107280,2112720,and be transformed maybe even things  about yourself that you think are  admirable and that you like because your
3bOJf1bjxq0,2112720,2119760,position you know your your self  conceptualization is so warped and wrong  and that's really daunting but you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,2119760,2125839,when people set themselves up as the  judge of being i mean i've written about  this a fair bit in my new book which is
3bOJf1bjxq0,2125839,2131920,called 12 rules for life  when people set themselves up as the  judge of being then they take on what
3bOJf1bjxq0,2131920,2138880,can only be described as a kind of  satanic arrogance because they've  actually taken to themselves the moral
3bOJf1bjxq0,2138880,2145200,right to criticize the structure of  existence itself it's like you better be  careful when you do something like that
3bOJf1bjxq0,2145200,2151119,because you're setting yourself up as  the judge of being  there's another rule in my book which is
3bOJf1bjxq0,2151119,2156960,rule nine assume that the person that  you're listening to knows something you  don't well they do the person you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,2156960,2162079,listening to knows some things you don't  you can be sure of that now whether or  not you can get to them is a different
3bOJf1bjxq0,2162079,2167920,matter but if you do get to them it's a  real deal for you that's why you want to  listen to the other person's arguments
3bOJf1bjxq0,2167920,2173520,is because you're not everything you  could be you don't know the pathway  forward with as much clarity as you
3bOJf1bjxq0,2173520,2180480,could and it's possible this is one of  the wonderful things  that i've had the privilege of  experiencing as a clinician you know
3bOJf1bjxq0,2180480,2186800,because people it's like i live inside a  dostoevsky novel as a clinician people  come in and they tell me about their
3bOJf1bjxq0,2186800,2192800,lives and i listen to them and they tell  me things that are just absolutely  beyond belief you know and i learn from
3bOJf1bjxq0,2192800,2198000,my clients constantly they're they're  telling me honestly about their  experience they tell me things they
3bOJf1bjxq0,2198000,2204320,wouldn't tell anyone else because i  actually listen to them but part of the  reason i listen is because i'm desperate  to listen it's like there's a
3bOJf1bjxq0,2204320,2210160,possibility i'm going to do something  stupid in the next five years that's  going to be like fatal and there's some
3bOJf1bjxq0,2210160,2216720,small possibility that if we have a  decent discussion that you'll tell me  something that will eliminate some of my
3bOJf1bjxq0,2216720,2222720,blindness so that i don't have to fall  into that particular pit and if you have  a good sensitivity for the depth of the
3bOJf1bjxq0,2222720,2228720,pit then you know you're pretty bloody  motivated to avoid it  and so and that and and that that
3bOJf1bjxq0,2228720,2235200,dialogue is it's it's dialogic it's  dialogues right it's shared logos it's  the way that we redeem ourselves
3bOJf1bjxq0,2235200,2242240,mutually moving forward  i like this one and i think i mean this  is very clearly what you do be precise
3bOJf1bjxq0,2242240,2249599,in your speech  so in in genesis one of the things god  has adam do first so god makes the world
3bOJf1bjxq0,2249599,2255440,by speaking okay so that's the first  thing to think about  you're supposed to think like
3bOJf1bjxq0,2255440,2261680,in a sophisticated way about this the  idea is that there's some integral  relationship between
3bOJf1bjxq0,2261680,2270079,communication and the structure of being  it's part of the role that consciousness  plays in the world whatever that role is
3bOJf1bjxq0,2270079,2275200,language  takes the chaos and makes it into things
3bOJf1bjxq0,2275200,2280400,and so  god has adam name all the animals  they're not even really real until they
3bOJf1bjxq0,2280400,2286480,have names  now  they're more implicit that's another you  know here's a here's an example let's
3bOJf1bjxq0,2286480,2292800,say that  you're having a rough patch in your  relationship  and you don't know why
3bOJf1bjxq0,2292800,2297839,it's unnameable is it real well yeah  it's manifesting itself in a like a
3bOJf1bjxq0,2297839,2304160,physiological discomfort  then you talk about it and you name it  it's like it goes from this blurry thing
3bOJf1bjxq0,2304160,2310560,that's kind of potential it goes snap  and then it's this thing  right and then that's a horrible thing
3bOJf1bjxq0,2310560,2315760,it's like a little poisonous thing but  it's not a whole  foggy cloud of potential poison it's
3bOJf1bjxq0,2315760,2322720,like this little sharp poison thing and  then you think okay  it's real it's a little monster but it's
3bOJf1bjxq0,2322720,2329680,not it's little at least and now  probably we can do something about it if  we can admit to it
3bOJf1bjxq0,2332079,2338400,there is no faith and no courage and no  sacrifice in doing what is expedient
3bOJf1bjxq0,2338400,2344400,what do you say to those viewers that  don't pursue their dreams and are locked  into their careers
3bOJf1bjxq0,2344400,2350960,because they are too afraid to take  risks and pursue something meaningful  well the first thing i would say is
3bOJf1bjxq0,2350960,2357200,well you should be afraid of taking  risks and pursuing something meaningful  but you should be more afraid of staying
3bOJf1bjxq0,2357200,2362240,where you are if it's making you  miserable it's like the first thing you  want to do is dispense with the idea
3bOJf1bjxq0,2362240,2367359,that you get to have any  any permanent security outside of your
3bOJf1bjxq0,2367359,2373359,ability to contend and adapt it's the  same issue with children it's like  you're paying a price by sitting there
3bOJf1bjxq0,2373359,2379200,being miserable you might say well the  devil i know is better than the one i  don't it's like don't be so sure of that
3bOJf1bjxq0,2379200,2384560,the clock is ticking  and if you're miserable in your job now  and you change nothing in five years
3bOJf1bjxq0,2384560,2390720,you'll be much more miserable and you'll  be a lot older but isn't it the luxury  to pursue what is meaningful our viewers
3bOJf1bjxq0,2390720,2397119,have mortgages they have children yeah  they have payments and loans it's a  luxury to pursue because we lack the
3bOJf1bjxq0,2397119,2402320,resources well i don't think i don't  remember now i'm not talking about what  makes you happy
3bOJf1bjxq0,2402320,2408560,it's a luxury to pursue what makes you  happy it's a moral obligation to pursue  what you find meaningful
3bOJf1bjxq0,2408560,2415359,and that doesn't mean it's easy it might  require sacrifice if you need to change  your job too let's say you have a family
3bOJf1bjxq0,2415359,2421040,and and children and a mortgage you have  responsibilities  you've already picked up those
3bOJf1bjxq0,2421040,2428000,responsibilities you don't just get to  walk away scot-free say well i don't  like my job i quit that's no strategy
3bOJf1bjxq0,2428000,2435200,but what you might have to do is you  think well this job is killing my soul  all right so what do i have to do about  that well i have to look for another job
3bOJf1bjxq0,2435200,2441920,well no one wants to hire me it's like  okay maybe you need to educate yourself  more maybe you need to update your your
3bOJf1bjxq0,2441920,2447680,curriculum vita your resume maybe you  need to overcome your fear of being  interviewed
3bOJf1bjxq0,2447680,2453119,maybe you need to sharpen your social  skills like you have to think about  these things strategically if you're
3bOJf1bjxq0,2453119,2458560,going to switch careers you have to do  it like an intelligent responsible  person that might take you a couple of
3bOJf1bjxq0,2458560,2465599,years of of effort to do properly i've  dealt with hundreds of people in my  clinical and consulting practice and we
3bOJf1bjxq0,2465599,2471119,set a goal we develop a vision and work  towards it and it things
3bOJf1bjxq0,2471119,2476480,inevitably get better for people so it's  not a luxury it's it's difficult it's a
3bOJf1bjxq0,2476480,2482580,moral responsibility and it isn't  happiness it's not the pursuit isn't for  happiness
3bOJf1bjxq0,2482580,2501630,[Music]
3bOJf1bjxq0,2502960,2505040,you
