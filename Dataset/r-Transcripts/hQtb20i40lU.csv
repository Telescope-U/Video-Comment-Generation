hQtb20i40lU,4240,5600,welcome back everybody to another
hQtb20i40lU,5600,8080,episode of direct comparison in today's
hQtb20i40lU,8080,9440,episode we're going to take a look at
hQtb20i40lU,9440,12400,the newly released gran turismo 7 and
hQtb20i40lU,12400,14559,see what exactly it does differently
hQtb20i40lU,14559,16640,both technically and from a gameplay
hQtb20i40lU,16640,18480,perspective to the previous entry to the
hQtb20i40lU,18480,21039,series gran turismo sport
hQtb20i40lU,21039,22960,for this analysis both games are being
hQtb20i40lU,22960,25519,played on the playstation 5 outputting
hQtb20i40lU,25519,28640,on a 4k display with the visual settings
hQtb20i40lU,28640,30480,set to their quality presets whenever
hQtb20i40lU,30480,31760,possible
hQtb20i40lU,31760,33680,though i do feel it's important to note
hQtb20i40lU,33680,35760,that these settings largely impact the
hQtb20i40lU,35760,37760,quality of the replay videos and photo
hQtb20i40lU,37760,39120,mode options
hQtb20i40lU,39120,41200,so while i will show close-ups of the
hQtb20i40lU,41200,43200,vehicles and track elements using these
hQtb20i40lU,43200,45600,modes i'll also be sure to show actual
hQtb20i40lU,45600,47440,gameplay sequences throughout to help
hQtb20i40lU,47440,49039,give you a better sense of what the game
hQtb20i40lU,49039,51440,will look like across the board alright
hQtb20i40lU,51440,53039,so let's kick this comparison off by
hQtb20i40lU,53039,54960,first taking a look at some car models
hQtb20i40lU,54960,58160,starting with the ferrari 458 italia
hQtb20i40lU,58160,59920,just like with gran turismo sport the
hQtb20i40lU,59920,62160,vehicle models in gran turismo 7 are
hQtb20i40lU,62160,64158,nothing short of remarkable
hQtb20i40lU,64158,66320,there is an insane attention to detail
hQtb20i40lU,66320,68479,to every available vehicle with an
hQtb20i40lU,68479,70880,exceptionally high poly count and a near
hQtb20i40lU,70880,73360,flawless color accuracy for each factory
hQtb20i40lU,73360,74720,paint job
hQtb20i40lU,74720,77119,ferrari reds for example appear the
hQtb20i40lU,77119,78960,exact right tone of red that you'd
hQtb20i40lU,78960,80720,expect from the real thing
hQtb20i40lU,80720,82479,and this is brought out even more so
hQtb20i40lU,82479,85119,with an appropriate hdr display
hQtb20i40lU,85119,86880,then there's all these small details
hQtb20i40lU,86880,89439,like the ferrari insignia the headlamps
hQtb20i40lU,89439,92000,and tail lights the wheel hubs and the
hQtb20i40lU,92000,94400,beautifully decorated interiors that are
hQtb20i40lU,94400,96960,not just retained but enhanced further
hQtb20i40lU,96960,99600,thanks to a native 4k output as opposed
hQtb20i40lU,99600,102799,to the checkerboarded 1800p used before
hQtb20i40lU,102799,105040,with this big bump to the resolution you
hQtb20i40lU,105040,107119,can expect a much cleaner sharper
hQtb20i40lU,107119,109520,presentation overall greatly reducing
hQtb20i40lU,109520,112000,the poor aliasing along its vehicles an
hQtb20i40lU,112000,114880,issue that played gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,114880,117040,gt7 also benefits from much more
hQtb20i40lU,117040,118880,realistic reflective surfaces for its
hQtb20i40lU,118880,120159,vehicles as well
hQtb20i40lU,120159,122079,with higher resolution cube maps to use
hQtb20i40lU,122079,124000,for the in-game models and more
hQtb20i40lU,124000,126320,sophisticated ray tracing techniques in
hQtb20i40lU,126320,128000,any of the game's available photo or
hQtb20i40lU,128000,130160,replay modes next let's take a look at
hQtb20i40lU,130160,131440,the environments
hQtb20i40lU,131440,133840,one of the weaker visual elements of gt
hQtb20i40lU,133840,135920,sports presentation was without a doubt
hQtb20i40lU,135920,138000,its environmental design
hQtb20i40lU,138000,140319,iconic courses like brands hatch and
hQtb20i40lU,140319,142640,mount panorama while faithful to their
hQtb20i40lU,142640,144239,real-life counterparts as far as the
hQtb20i40lU,144239,145520,track goes
hQtb20i40lU,145520,147360,lacked at the level of detail necessary
hQtb20i40lU,147360,149599,to make these locations feel believable
hQtb20i40lU,149599,151599,the texture maps for necessities like
hQtb20i40lU,151599,154480,the tarmac road stripes dirt and grass
hQtb20i40lU,154480,157120,were all low res by today's standards
hQtb20i40lU,157120,158879,and quickly fall apart under close
hQtb20i40lU,158879,160160,scrutiny
hQtb20i40lU,160160,161920,while the trees closest to the edge of
hQtb20i40lU,161920,163760,the track were acceptable thanks to a
hQtb20i40lU,163760,166640,smart use of multiple sprites per branch
hQtb20i40lU,166640,169360,the layer of 2d trees in the backdrop is
hQtb20i40lU,169360,171440,easy to spot due to the lack of proper
hQtb20i40lU,171440,172480,shadowing
hQtb20i40lU,172480,174800,gran turismo 7 doesn't necessarily
hQtb20i40lU,174800,177519,improve everything across the board here
hQtb20i40lU,177519,179840,all pre-existing tracks built to be used
hQtb20i40lU,179840,182159,in gt sport have most definitely been
hQtb20i40lU,182159,184720,recycled back into gran turismo 7.
hQtb20i40lU,184720,186239,and you can tell a lot of the same
hQtb20i40lU,186239,188800,assets have been recycled as well
hQtb20i40lU,188800,190480,but there have been a number of nice
hQtb20i40lU,190480,192239,improvements all throughout that help
hQtb20i40lU,192239,193680,transform these environments into
hQtb20i40lU,193680,195440,something more tangible
hQtb20i40lU,195440,197519,almost all of the textures for example
hQtb20i40lU,197519,199120,have been updated with higher res
hQtb20i40lU,199120,201840,variants most notably this dirt texture
hQtb20i40lU,201840,203599,used on the opposite side of this track
hQtb20i40lU,203599,206000,barrier vegetation has also been beefed
hQtb20i40lU,206000,208799,up considerably with more 3d tree models
hQtb20i40lU,208799,211280,being used to fill in the backdrops and
hQtb20i40lU,211280,213120,appropriate shadowing being applied at
hQtb20i40lU,213120,215200,further distances to create the illusion
hQtb20i40lU,215200,217200,of a dense tree line
hQtb20i40lU,217200,219360,there's even new grass sprites added to
hQtb20i40lU,219360,221599,all the grass terrain on each track
hQtb20i40lU,221599,223599,which helps a great deal in giving gran
hQtb20i40lU,223599,225680,turismo's world a more fleshed out
hQtb20i40lU,225680,227120,appearance
hQtb20i40lU,227120,229360,this has helped even more by gt7's
hQtb20i40lU,229360,231760,largely increased draw distances which
hQtb20i40lU,231760,233519,really get a chance to shine in some of
hQtb20i40lU,233519,236720,the more original gt tracks with vast
hQtb20i40lU,236720,238400,distant valleys offering some of the
hQtb20i40lU,238400,241519,most scenic locations to drive alongside
hQtb20i40lU,241519,243760,pedestrians have similarly been given a
hQtb20i40lU,243760,245760,bit of an update with a bunch of new
hQtb20i40lU,245760,247439,animated sprites being added to the
hQtb20i40lU,247439,250080,crowd to bulk up the character diversity
hQtb20i40lU,250080,252560,along with a few new 3d model characters
hQtb20i40lU,252560,255280,that while not necessarily amazing look
hQtb20i40lU,255280,257680,to be a step up from what we had before
hQtb20i40lU,257680,260400,collectively gran turismo 7's tracks are
hQtb20i40lU,260400,262560,a solid step in the right direction and
hQtb20i40lU,262560,264080,offer improvements in the areas that
hQtb20i40lU,264080,266160,needed the most though it's
hQtb20i40lU,266160,268240,understandably still not mind-blowing
hQtb20i40lU,268240,270560,either with even some of the most nicely
hQtb20i40lU,270560,272560,decorated courses feeling like they're a
hQtb20i40lU,272560,274720,couple years behind thankfully the
hQtb20i40lU,274720,276560,lighting does do a nice enough job
hQtb20i40lU,276560,278639,distracting from these shortcomings with
hQtb20i40lU,278639,280639,some gorgeous true to life color tones
hQtb20i40lU,280639,282400,and dynamic time of day options
hQtb20i40lU,282400,285040,available for practically every track
hQtb20i40lU,285040,287040,it's almost identical to the lighting
hQtb20i40lU,287040,289280,rig used in gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,289280,291199,but the improved reflections i mentioned
hQtb20i40lU,291199,293440,earlier do make a drastic difference for
hQtb20i40lU,293440,296080,the cars themselves whether in game or
hQtb20i40lU,296080,298400,when watching higher quality replays the
hQtb20i40lU,298400,300240,reflective cube and sphere maps have all
hQtb20i40lU,300240,302400,been enhanced as you can see here
hQtb20i40lU,302400,304400,displaying higher quality replications
hQtb20i40lU,304400,306240,of the surrounding environment in
hQtb20i40lU,306240,308320,replays these reflections are mostly
hQtb20i40lU,308320,310080,replaced with ray trace reflections
hQtb20i40lU,310080,312400,instead which can accurately project
hQtb20i40lU,312400,314560,images of off-screen elements like other
hQtb20i40lU,314560,317840,cars trees and even environmental decor
hQtb20i40lU,317840,320320,it's a very demanding effect and so
hQtb20i40lU,320320,322639,whenever this ray tracing is active the
hQtb20i40lU,322639,324800,game drops its frame rate to a locked 30
hQtb20i40lU,324800,327520,fps instead though players do have the
hQtb20i40lU,327520,329600,option to swap to a performance mode
hQtb20i40lU,329600,331360,effectively disabling ray tracing
hQtb20i40lU,331360,333120,altogether
hQtb20i40lU,333120,335440,however i did find that environmental
hQtb20i40lU,335440,337199,reflections in game do feel like a
hQtb20i40lU,337199,340000,slight step back as these roads even
hQtb20i40lU,340000,342160,with the heaviest rain options and water
hQtb20i40lU,342160,344560,accumulation on the road surface itself
hQtb20i40lU,344560,346320,seems to make more use of specular
hQtb20i40lU,346320,348000,lighting effects rather than the screen
hQtb20i40lU,348000,350320,space reflections though my guess is
hQtb20i40lU,350320,352160,that this is a result of pooled water
hQtb20i40lU,352160,354240,now having an actual direct impact on
hQtb20i40lU,354240,356560,the gameplay in gt7 which i'll discuss
hQtb20i40lU,356560,357759,more in a bit
hQtb20i40lU,357759,359919,as for the actual ambient lighting
hQtb20i40lU,359919,362400,something about gt7 still feels weirdly
hQtb20i40lU,362400,363520,off
hQtb20i40lU,363520,365280,volumetric lighting feels noticeably
hQtb20i40lU,365280,367360,absent regardless of the time of day or
hQtb20i40lU,367360,368800,weather conditions
hQtb20i40lU,368800,371360,and bloom effects for some odd reason
hQtb20i40lU,371360,374479,feel overly exaggerated in gt7
hQtb20i40lU,374479,376720,making rows of cars or reflective
hQtb20i40lU,376720,379039,material alongside the track blindingly
hQtb20i40lU,379039,381199,bright at certain angles something that
hQtb20i40lU,381199,383680,didn't occur nearly as often if at all
hQtb20i40lU,383680,385360,in gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,385360,388160,next we have shadows despite using the
hQtb20i40lU,388160,390240,exact same time of day settings in these
hQtb20i40lU,390240,392720,races i found that often the shadows in
hQtb20i40lU,392720,395440,gt7 are much sharper than those found in
hQtb20i40lU,395440,397199,gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,397199,400000,vehicle shadows are now razor sharp with
hQtb20i40lU,400000,402080,every silhouetted detail being displayed
hQtb20i40lU,402080,403360,on the pavement
hQtb20i40lU,403360,405759,whereas in gt sport there was a great
hQtb20i40lU,405759,408319,deal of softening added to these edges
hQtb20i40lU,408319,410000,often accompanied by some fairly
hQtb20i40lU,410000,412479,apparent shimmer and artifacting
hQtb20i40lU,412479,414560,environmental shadows of objects further
hQtb20i40lU,414560,416560,from the shadow's projection also appear
hQtb20i40lU,416560,419199,sharper like this tree here where tree
hQtb20i40lU,419199,420880,leaves are almost being projected
hQtb20i40lU,420880,423199,perfectly on the road's surface whereas
hQtb20i40lU,423199,425599,in gt sport they appeared much softer
hQtb20i40lU,425599,428240,and were arguably more realistic before
hQtb20i40lU,428240,430560,but like with the car shadows these tree
hQtb20i40lU,430560,432720,shadows in gt sport were often plagued
hQtb20i40lU,432720,434720,with a lot of artifacting as different
hQtb20i40lU,434720,436639,quality versions would pop in and out of
hQtb20i40lU,436639,438800,existence as the player drove by
hQtb20i40lU,438800,440720,a problem that does not seem to plague
hQtb20i40lU,440720,443919,gt7 nearly as much with only a few major
hQtb20i40lU,443919,446319,exceptions night shadows cast by the
hQtb20i40lU,446319,448400,player's car and dark races have also
hQtb20i40lU,448400,451199,been redone casting large dark shadows
hQtb20i40lU,451199,452720,dynamically depending on the player's
hQtb20i40lU,452720,454400,headlight direction and the object
hQtb20i40lU,454400,456720,blocking them it's at times a nice
hQtb20i40lU,456720,459039,looking effect but some of that same
hQtb20i40lU,459039,461599,unnatural dithering still occurs mixed
hQtb20i40lU,461599,463280,with the fact that the shadow seems to
hQtb20i40lU,463280,465199,completely negate the ai's own
hQtb20i40lU,465199,467360,headlights so there's definitely plenty
hQtb20i40lU,467360,469440,of room for improvement moving on we
hQtb20i40lU,469440,470800,have effects
hQtb20i40lU,470800,473280,unfortunately gran turismo 7 still does
hQtb20i40lU,473280,475280,not offer the sort of realistic damage
hQtb20i40lU,475280,477520,models i would have hoped for but it's
hQtb20i40lU,477520,479120,important to note that this is more than
hQtb20i40lU,479120,481039,likely a licensing issue with using
hQtb20i40lU,481039,483360,these real-life vehicle brands rather
hQtb20i40lU,483360,486000,than a failure on the developer's part
hQtb20i40lU,486000,488240,vehicles can still be damaged but the
hQtb20i40lU,488240,490080,cosmetic appearance of even the most
hQtb20i40lU,490080,492400,severe crash is easy to miss
hQtb20i40lU,492400,494879,with only tiny fender dents and cracked
hQtb20i40lU,494879,496400,headlights
hQtb20i40lU,496400,498080,what's odd though is that the great
hQtb20i40lU,498080,499759,looking particles that kick up from
hQtb20i40lU,499759,502000,driving over loose gravel and sand has
hQtb20i40lU,502000,504240,been greatly reduced this time around
hQtb20i40lU,504240,506240,with only stationary particle effects
hQtb20i40lU,506240,508000,appearing in the vehicle's wake rather
hQtb20i40lU,508000,510400,than kicking up like before
hQtb20i40lU,510400,513039,it's a weird drop in quality though my
hQtb20i40lU,513039,515360,guess is that this might just be a bug
hQtb20i40lU,515360,517120,as other particle-based effects like
hQtb20i40lU,517120,519919,rain have seen a major improvement not
hQtb20i40lU,519919,521919,only is heavy torrential rainfall
hQtb20i40lU,521919,523919,represented with significantly more
hQtb20i40lU,523919,526560,particles on screen in gran turismo 7
hQtb20i40lU,526560,528560,but the water itself will now pool
hQtb20i40lU,528560,530240,realistically along the surface of the
hQtb20i40lU,530240,532959,road and will relentlessly cause cars to
hQtb20i40lU,532959,535440,hydroplane and largely impede vehicle
hQtb20i40lU,535440,536480,control
hQtb20i40lU,536480,538480,rain wasn't even technically featured in
hQtb20i40lU,538480,540720,gt sport when it first released and was
hQtb20i40lU,540720,543200,added later with a title update so it's
hQtb20i40lU,543200,545279,great to see gt7 come out of the gate
hQtb20i40lU,545279,546959,with this feature not only available
hQtb20i40lU,546959,549200,from the get-go but enhanced a great
hQtb20i40lU,549200,550560,deal
hQtb20i40lU,550560,552080,mix that together with the improved
hQtb20i40lU,552080,554399,reflections and specular lighting and
hQtb20i40lU,554399,556640,rainy nighttime races like this one
hQtb20i40lU,556640,558480,really pop out on the screen to deliver
hQtb20i40lU,558480,560640,something impressive adding to this is
hQtb20i40lU,560640,563040,gran turismo 7's excellent use of the
hQtb20i40lU,563040,565600,dual senses adaptive triggers which
hQtb20i40lU,565600,567760,feels much better than the standard
hQtb20i40lU,567760,569760,rumble effects used in gran turismo
hQtb20i40lU,569760,570959,sport
hQtb20i40lU,570959,572720,every type of road surface will feel
hQtb20i40lU,572720,575440,different with rumble strips bridge
hQtb20i40lU,575440,578000,junctions and every small impact with
hQtb20i40lU,578000,580320,other cars being appropriately reflected
hQtb20i40lU,580320,582080,in either trigger depending on which
hQtb20i40lU,582080,584240,side of the car is affected
hQtb20i40lU,584240,586959,i've played quite a few ps5 games now
hQtb20i40lU,586959,588720,many that make liberal use of these
hQtb20i40lU,588720,590800,triggers with mixed results
hQtb20i40lU,590800,593200,but gt7's incorporation is probably one
hQtb20i40lU,593200,594640,of the best so far
hQtb20i40lU,594640,596640,and is one of the better new features on
hQtb20i40lU,596640,598480,offer with this game
hQtb20i40lU,598480,600800,another benefit gt7 sees thanks to the
hQtb20i40lU,600800,603120,new hardware is the exceptionally sped
hQtb20i40lU,603120,605360,up loading times that can last between
hQtb20i40lU,605360,607519,only two or four seconds
hQtb20i40lU,607519,609839,as opposed to the 10 to 20 seconds we
hQtb20i40lU,609839,611760,saw with gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,611760,614240,it's a hugely welcome change especially
hQtb20i40lU,614240,616240,considering how often gran turismo
hQtb20i40lU,616240,618000,requires players to put between menu
hQtb20i40lU,618000,620800,pages though i do wish that polyphony
hQtb20i40lU,620800,622959,had found ways to streamline the menus a
hQtb20i40lU,622959,626240,bit more and let players swap cars or
hQtb20i40lU,626240,628720,open roulette rewards from the user menu
hQtb20i40lU,628720,629920,bar at the top
hQtb20i40lU,629920,631920,rather than requiring additional loading
hQtb20i40lU,631920,634640,time just to visit the proper menu page
hQtb20i40lU,634640,636959,another important distinction with gt7
hQtb20i40lU,636959,639120,over its predecessor is its available
hQtb20i40lU,639120,640959,game modes and menus
hQtb20i40lU,640959,643120,gt sport was a weird game when released
hQtb20i40lU,643120,646000,back in 2017. it never really felt like
hQtb20i40lU,646000,648320,a main line entry to the series which is
hQtb20i40lU,648320,650640,evident by its naming convention and
hQtb20i40lU,650640,652240,seemed to lean more heavily towards
hQtb20i40lU,652240,653839,supporting its online competitive
hQtb20i40lU,653839,654959,atmosphere
hQtb20i40lU,654959,656800,as opposed to its traditional single
hQtb20i40lU,656800,658079,player campaign
hQtb20i40lU,658079,659839,the game did eventually get a
hQtb20i40lU,659839,662320,rudimentary campaign with a long list of
hQtb20i40lU,662320,664880,races to cross off a checklist but it
hQtb20i40lU,664880,668079,still never quite felt right gt7 however
hQtb20i40lU,668079,670399,is the full package with all the great
hQtb20i40lU,670399,671839,multiplayer elements that fans loved
hQtb20i40lU,671839,674560,about gt sport along with a complete
hQtb20i40lU,674560,677360,racing career mode right out of the box
hQtb20i40lU,677360,679360,the career involves collecting cars
hQtb20i40lU,679360,682000,using easy to follow menu books given to
hQtb20i40lU,682000,684720,the player at the central cafe hub
hQtb20i40lU,684720,686640,with these menus players must then
hQtb20i40lU,686640,688880,participate in races around the world
hQtb20i40lU,688880,690240,each featuring different car
hQtb20i40lU,690240,692399,manufacturers and brands all while
hQtb20i40lU,692399,694800,earning necessary licenses competing in
hQtb20i40lU,694800,696720,championships and carefully tuning
hQtb20i40lU,696720,698399,vehicles with a robust vehicle
hQtb20i40lU,698399,700959,modification menu the main world map
hQtb20i40lU,700959,703279,screen is somewhat convoluted as most
hQtb20i40lU,703279,705600,granchismo games have a tendency to be
hQtb20i40lU,705600,707839,but thanks to a decent pace and an
hQtb20i40lU,707839,709680,unmistakable passion for automotive
hQtb20i40lU,709680,712000,history the game is just a joy to play
hQtb20i40lU,712000,713680,through it never feels quite as
hQtb20i40lU,713680,716079,monotonous as padding through gt sports
hQtb20i40lU,716079,718160,available single player offerings my
hQtb20i40lU,718160,719920,only complaint with the layout is that
hQtb20i40lU,719920,722000,the arcade mode is weirdly integrated
hQtb20i40lU,722000,724320,into the career mode menus so trying to
hQtb20i40lU,724320,726480,set up a quick race with any owned
hQtb20i40lU,726480,728320,vehicle requires that you visit a
hQtb20i40lU,728320,731200,location submenu and then select the
hQtb20i40lU,731200,733519,optional race options at the bottom gran
hQtb20i40lU,733519,736079,turismo sports menus were simply more
hQtb20i40lU,736079,738639,intuitive here with the modes listed
hQtb20i40lU,738639,740639,clearly right at the top via drop down
hQtb20i40lU,740639,741920,menus
hQtb20i40lU,741920,744720,if gt7 could integrate something similar
hQtb20i40lU,744720,746880,while retaining its semi-immersive
hQtb20i40lU,746880,749279,campaign world map then i think we could
hQtb20i40lU,749279,751360,have the best of both worlds
hQtb20i40lU,751360,752959,for players interested in the cars
hQtb20i40lU,752959,756000,themselves gran turismo 7 also sees a
hQtb20i40lU,756000,758320,big increase to its starting lineup with
hQtb20i40lU,758320,761839,over 424 cars available at launch as
hQtb20i40lU,761839,765839,opposed to the 168 cars in gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,765839,768639,however that number is a bit misleading
hQtb20i40lU,768639,771839,as a lot of gt7s cars are unique racing
hQtb20i40lU,771839,773600,variants of pre-existing cars in the
hQtb20i40lU,773600,776240,lineup and gran turismo sport did
hQtb20i40lU,776240,779519,eventually up the total car list to 324
hQtb20i40lU,779519,782800,through updates gt7 also offers way more
hQtb20i40lU,782800,785440,tracks for players to race these cars on
hQtb20i40lU,785440,788639,at launch gt7 offers 34 different tracks
hQtb20i40lU,788639,791360,to race across with 97 different layouts
hQtb20i40lU,791360,792959,between them all
hQtb20i40lU,792959,795360,gran turismo sport by comparison only
hQtb20i40lU,795360,797920,offered 29 tracks at first
hQtb20i40lU,797920,800480,and only ever managed to get to 82 total
hQtb20i40lU,800480,802959,configurations by the end
hQtb20i40lU,802959,805120,finally let's wrap up with a brief sound

hQtb20i40lU,1052880,1054160,comparison
hQtb20i40lU,1054160,1057200,overall gran turismo 7 is the gt game
hQtb20i40lU,1057200,1058559,that i personally have been waiting
hQtb20i40lU,1058559,1060640,years for it takes everything that
hQtb20i40lU,1060640,1063200,worked in gt sport and improves upon it
hQtb20i40lU,1063200,1064799,with a sizeable bump to its visual
hQtb20i40lU,1064799,1066640,quality while also reintroducing
hQtb20i40lU,1066640,1068000,gameplay elements that fans have been
hQtb20i40lU,1068000,1069679,asking for
hQtb20i40lU,1069679,1071919,there's still room for improvement as
hQtb20i40lU,1071919,1073760,the game still has a rather stale
hQtb20i40lU,1073760,1076080,appearance in many instances
hQtb20i40lU,1076080,1077919,but i genuinely found myself having a
hQtb20i40lU,1077919,1079360,lot of fun playing through this game's
hQtb20i40lU,1079360,1081280,career mode and i'm looking forward to
hQtb20i40lU,1081280,1082880,seeing how this game progresses in the
hQtb20i40lU,1082880,1084080,future
hQtb20i40lU,1084080,1085919,but what do you guys think are you
hQtb20i40lU,1085919,1088240,impressed with gran turismo 7 or do you
hQtb20i40lU,1088240,1089919,still prefer the look and feel of gran
hQtb20i40lU,1089919,1091840,turismo sport instead
