5D86b45yJzU,240,2240,do you have pain on the bottom of your
5D86b45yJzU,2240,4080,foot when standing
5D86b45yJzU,4080,6399,walking or taking that first step out of
5D86b45yJzU,6399,7919,bed in the morning
5D86b45yJzU,7919,10160,in this video i'm going to discuss
5D86b45yJzU,10160,13360,plantar fasciitis dispel the most common
5D86b45yJzU,13360,16560,myths associated with the diagnosis and
5D86b45yJzU,16560,18960,teach you everything you need to know
5D86b45yJzU,18960,21600,about managing the condition the plantar
5D86b45yJzU,21600,24480,fascia is an expansive connective tissue
5D86b45yJzU,24480,26560,located on the bottom of the foot that
5D86b45yJzU,26560,29359,aids in stability and control of the
5D86b45yJzU,29359,30400,foot
5D86b45yJzU,30400,32320,activities that involve extension of the
5D86b45yJzU,32320,33440,big toe
5D86b45yJzU,33440,35520,loading of the achilles tendon and
5D86b45yJzU,35520,37360,weight bearing in general such as
5D86b45yJzU,37360,40160,standing walking and running increase
5D86b45yJzU,40160,42840,the tension experienced by the plantar
5D86b45yJzU,42840,45680,fascia plantar fasciitis refers to
5D86b45yJzU,45680,48399,inflammation of the plantar fascia
5D86b45yJzU,48399,51199,however current research suggests that
5D86b45yJzU,51199,54000,local inflammation is likely not the
5D86b45yJzU,54000,56480,primary driver of the condition
5D86b45yJzU,56480,57440,therefore
5D86b45yJzU,57440,59600,real at all suggests calling it plantar
5D86b45yJzU,59600,63199,fasciopathy or plantar heel pain
5D86b45yJzU,63199,65198,this is important to know because most
5D86b45yJzU,65198,67200,people associate inflammation with the
5D86b45yJzU,67200,69200,need to rest ice and take
5D86b45yJzU,69200,71680,anti-inflammatory medication which are
5D86b45yJzU,71680,73840,not recommended treatments
5D86b45yJzU,73840,75600,it's also not recommended to
5D86b45yJzU,75600,77920,aggressively roll or massage the bottom
5D86b45yJzU,77920,79840,of your foot with the intention of
5D86b45yJzU,79840,82080,breaking up scar tissue or adhesions
5D86b45yJzU,82080,84560,because it's actually not possible to do
5D86b45yJzU,84560,85520,either
5D86b45yJzU,85520,88320,the plantar fascia is a dense fibrous
5D86b45yJzU,88320,90640,connective tissue that cannot be altered
5D86b45yJzU,90640,93280,with our hands or other tools
5D86b45yJzU,93280,95600,you can roll your foot on a frozen water
5D86b45yJzU,95600,97840,bottle or lacrosse ball if it feels good
5D86b45yJzU,97840,99680,for you and doesn't take away from the
5D86b45yJzU,99680,102479,primary goals of rehab but neither are
5D86b45yJzU,102479,103600,needed
5D86b45yJzU,103600,105680,you may have also heard that the cause
5D86b45yJzU,105680,108320,of your pain is a bone spur but research
5D86b45yJzU,108320,110880,by hanson at all found that a heel spur
5D86b45yJzU,110880,112720,had no influence on either the
5D86b45yJzU,112720,115840,development or prognosis of symptoms and
5D86b45yJzU,115840,118000,that many patients had a heel spur
5D86b45yJzU,118000,120159,without having symptoms
5D86b45yJzU,120159,122880,to understand what is recommended it's
5D86b45yJzU,122880,124960,important to discuss who gets plantar
5D86b45yJzU,124960,127280,heel pain the condition generally
5D86b45yJzU,127280,129360,presents along a continuum
5D86b45yJzU,129360,131599,on one end there is the younger more
5D86b45yJzU,131599,134239,active population such as runners
5D86b45yJzU,134239,136480,on the other side there are the older
5D86b45yJzU,136480,138640,more sedentary individuals with a higher
5D86b45yJzU,138640,140319,body mass index
5D86b45yJzU,140319,143040,but why did you get plantar heel pain
5D86b45yJzU,143040,145120,a simplified framework is that it's
5D86b45yJzU,145120,147360,thought to occur when the intensity
5D86b45yJzU,147360,149760,frequency and volume of plantar fascia
5D86b45yJzU,149760,152800,loading such as when standing walking or
5D86b45yJzU,152800,153680,running
5D86b45yJzU,153680,155920,exceeds your capacity to recover and
5D86b45yJzU,155920,157519,adapt appropriately
5D86b45yJzU,157519,159519,for the runners it often comes down to
5D86b45yJzU,159519,161760,doing too much too soon
5D86b45yJzU,161760,164000,for example perhaps you increase your
5D86b45yJzU,164000,166480,pace or total running mileage as you
5D86b45yJzU,166480,168080,were training for a race which
5D86b45yJzU,168080,170480,represents a spike in load
5D86b45yJzU,170480,172560,for the less active individuals it might
5D86b45yJzU,172560,174560,be related to a gradual decline in
5D86b45yJzU,174560,176879,general physical activity and overall
5D86b45yJzU,176879,179440,well-being which represents a decrease
5D86b45yJzU,179440,181040,in capacity
5D86b45yJzU,181040,183519,therefore the goal of rehab for either
5D86b45yJzU,183519,185680,population is to balance out this
5D86b45yJzU,185680,188080,equation so that your capacity is
5D86b45yJzU,188080,190879,greater than or equal to the various
5D86b45yJzU,190879,192560,loads you're experiencing on a
5D86b45yJzU,192560,195200,day-to-day and week to week basis
5D86b45yJzU,195200,197120,it's also important to point out that
5D86b45yJzU,197120,199760,other lifestyle factors like sleep
5D86b45yJzU,199760,202319,stress and nutrition can influence this
5D86b45yJzU,202319,204080,equation
5D86b45yJzU,204080,206400,based on this information my first
5D86b45yJzU,206400,209120,recommendation is to modify aggravating
5D86b45yJzU,209120,211519,activities to reduce the load side of
5D86b45yJzU,211519,212879,the equation
5D86b45yJzU,212879,215040,if you're a runner who can't tolerate
5D86b45yJzU,215040,217200,your current training program you need
5D86b45yJzU,217200,219920,to temporarily scale back by
5D86b45yJzU,219920,222560,manipulating the frequency mileage or
5D86b45yJzU,222560,224159,speed of your runs
5D86b45yJzU,224159,226239,similarly if you can't tolerate a
5D86b45yJzU,226239,228480,certain amount of walking or standing
5D86b45yJzU,228480,231120,you might need to do less if possible
5D86b45yJzU,231120,233280,to maintain or increase your capacity it
5D86b45yJzU,233280,234959,may be helpful to swim
5D86b45yJzU,234959,237120,cycle or perform the exercises
5D86b45yJzU,237120,239040,demonstrated in this video
5D86b45yJzU,239040,241120,i also highly recommend tracking your
5D86b45yJzU,241120,242959,daily steps because it helps you
5D86b45yJzU,242959,244720,understand your baseline level of
5D86b45yJzU,244720,247439,function and tolerance you don't need to
5D86b45yJzU,247439,249680,hit a certain step count you just need
5D86b45yJzU,249680,251760,to determine how much is too much right
5D86b45yJzU,251760,254720,now and very gradually build that up
5D86b45yJzU,254720,256720,over weeks and months
5D86b45yJzU,256720,259359,another fundamental component of rehab
5D86b45yJzU,259359,262800,is understanding and monitoring pain
5D86b45yJzU,262800,265199,ask yourself two questions
5D86b45yJzU,265199,268960,one is my pain tolerable during exercise
5D86b45yJzU,268960,270639,there's not a universally acceptable
5D86b45yJzU,270639,273440,answer you get to decide what tolerable
5D86b45yJzU,273440,274720,means
5D86b45yJzU,274720,277919,two is my pain better worse or the same
5D86b45yJzU,277919,280000,the day after exercise
5D86b45yJzU,280000,282160,if you feel fine during and immediately
5D86b45yJzU,282160,284080,after exercise but you have a
5D86b45yJzU,284080,285759,significant worsening of symptoms the
5D86b45yJzU,285759,286880,next day
5D86b45yJzU,286880,288560,that's an indication that you're doing
5D86b45yJzU,288560,291120,too much and need to back off a bit
5D86b45yJzU,291120,293199,you can assess your next day's symptoms
5D86b45yJzU,293199,294560,with your first step out of bed in the
5D86b45yJzU,294560,295440,morning
5D86b45yJzU,295440,298080,for example you rate your pain on day
5D86b45yJzU,298080,300560,one as a 2 out of 10 pain
5D86b45yJzU,300560,302320,you then perform your exercise routine
5D86b45yJzU,302320,304960,with intolerance go about your day and
5D86b45yJzU,304960,307840,go to bed without any major issues
5D86b45yJzU,307840,309759,the next morning you wake up and rate
5D86b45yJzU,309759,312720,your pain as a 5 out of 10. this means
5D86b45yJzU,312720,314240,that even though your symptoms were
5D86b45yJzU,314240,316639,tolerable during exercise you might have
5D86b45yJzU,316639,318800,done a little too much you didn't do any
5D86b45yJzU,318800,321600,harm but doing less next time would be
5D86b45yJzU,321600,323199,recommended
5D86b45yJzU,323199,326000,also you can replace the word exercise
5D86b45yJzU,326000,327919,with physical activity
5D86b45yJzU,327919,330320,work or anything else that affects your
5D86b45yJzU,330320,331680,symptoms
5D86b45yJzU,331680,333840,shoes and foot orthoses can be
5D86b45yJzU,333840,335840,considered for attempting to reduce the
5D86b45yJzU,335840,338400,load side of the equation by modifying
5D86b45yJzU,338400,340560,the amount of tension experienced by the
5D86b45yJzU,340560,343680,plantar fascia for example you can trial
5D86b45yJzU,343680,345680,a cheap heel cup or off the shelf
5D86b45yJzU,345680,347840,orthotic that supports the arch of the
5D86b45yJzU,347840,349759,foot to determine if it provides
5D86b45yJzU,349759,352240,short-term relief if you're working with
5D86b45yJzU,352240,354639,a podiatrist you can discuss custom foot
5D86b45yJzU,354639,356080,orthoses
5D86b45yJzU,356080,358639,in terms of shoe wear i'd expect a
5D86b45yJzU,358639,360800,minimalist shoe to increase plantar
5D86b45yJzU,360800,363360,fascia loading and a motion control type
5D86b45yJzU,363360,366160,shoe to decrease plantar fascia loading
5D86b45yJzU,366160,369039,theoretically then it may be helpful to
5D86b45yJzU,369039,371520,use a shoe that decreases the load on
5D86b45yJzU,371520,373600,the plantar fascia early on when you're
5D86b45yJzU,373600,375360,highly symptomatic
5D86b45yJzU,375360,377840,however what you choose to wear will be
5D86b45yJzU,377840,380319,based on your comfort beliefs
5D86b45yJzU,380319,382880,preferences and other factors
5D86b45yJzU,382880,385360,for the exercises i'm going to present
5D86b45yJzU,385360,388000,two categories with different purposes
5D86b45yJzU,388000,390400,the first category is meant to provide
5D86b45yJzU,390400,391919,short-term relief
5D86b45yJzU,391919,394720,one exercise is recommended based on the
5D86b45yJzU,394720,397280,research and the other two are optional
5D86b45yJzU,397280,398479,add-ons
5D86b45yJzU,398479,400720,the second category is meant to improve
5D86b45yJzU,400720,402960,long-term function and increase your
5D86b45yJzU,402960,405440,tolerance to standing walking and
5D86b45yJzU,405440,407919,running by gradually loading the plantar
5D86b45yJzU,407919,410880,fascia once again one exercise is
5D86b45yJzU,410880,413039,recommended and the other two are
5D86b45yJzU,413039,414720,optional add-ons
5D86b45yJzU,414720,416800,whether you decide to do one
5D86b45yJzU,416800,419680,two or all six of the movements depends
5D86b45yJzU,419680,421039,on your symptoms
5D86b45yJzU,421039,424400,goals time availability etc
5D86b45yJzU,424400,427120,tailor the exercises and all of this
5D86b45yJzU,427120,429520,information to suit your individual
5D86b45yJzU,429520,430400,needs
5D86b45yJzU,430400,432720,the first recommended exercise is a
5D86b45yJzU,432720,435599,plantar fascia stretch researched by
5D86b45yJzU,435599,439280,at all in 2003 and 2006
5D86b45yJzU,439280,441919,after periods of prolonged inactivity
5D86b45yJzU,441919,444160,such as sleeping or sitting you can
5D86b45yJzU,444160,446240,perform this stretch with the intention
5D86b45yJzU,446240,448319,of decreasing the pain you experience
5D86b45yJzU,448319,450639,upon standing or walking
5D86b45yJzU,450639,452639,place the affected foot on the opposite
5D86b45yJzU,452639,455759,leg and pull the toes up toward the shin
5D86b45yJzU,455759,457919,hold the stretch for 10 seconds and
5D86b45yJzU,457919,460080,repeat 10 times
5D86b45yJzU,460080,462000,two optional exercises that you can
5D86b45yJzU,462000,464319,perform after the plantar fascia stretch
5D86b45yJzU,464319,466800,are toe curls and toe yoga
5D86b45yJzU,466800,469039,toe curls involve flexing and extending
5D86b45yJzU,469039,471440,your toes with or without the use of a
5D86b45yJzU,471440,472400,towel
5D86b45yJzU,472400,475039,toe yoga involves tapping your big toe
5D86b45yJzU,475039,477840,and other toes in an alternating fashion
5D86b45yJzU,477840,480639,you can do one or both exercises for up
5D86b45yJzU,480639,483120,to a minute at a time
5D86b45yJzU,483120,485120,the recommended exercise for improving
5D86b45yJzU,485120,487440,long-term function is a heel raise
5D86b45yJzU,487440,489440,because it's weight-bearing requires
5D86b45yJzU,489440,491759,extension of the big toe and involves
5D86b45yJzU,491759,493680,loading of the achilles tendon and calf
5D86b45yJzU,493680,495039,complex
5D86b45yJzU,495039,496879,in their research by ralph left it all
5D86b45yJzU,496879,500960,in 2015 and real at all in 2019 a single
5D86b45yJzU,500960,503199,leg heel raise was performed on a step
5D86b45yJzU,503199,505520,with a towel under the big toe
5D86b45yJzU,505520,507919,here is a progression you can do with or
5D86b45yJzU,507919,510319,without the use of a towel or object
5D86b45yJzU,510319,511680,under your toes
5D86b45yJzU,511680,514240,level one double leg heel raises on flat
5D86b45yJzU,514240,517839,ground aim for three sets of 25 slow and
5D86b45yJzU,517839,520159,controlled repetitions use your hands
5D86b45yJzU,520159,522000,for balance as needed
5D86b45yJzU,522000,524640,level two single leg heel raises on flat
5D86b45yJzU,524640,528399,ground aim for three sets of 15 reps
5D86b45yJzU,528399,530880,level three single leg heel raises on a
5D86b45yJzU,530880,533920,step aim for three to four sets of 8 to
5D86b45yJzU,533920,537279,15 reps over time you can add weight as
5D86b45yJzU,537279,538959,needed
5D86b45yJzU,538959,541040,an optional exercise for improving the

5D86b45yJzU,636959,639120,knee drive you can progress the previous

5D86b45yJzU,646399,650480,over time you can add weight as needed
5D86b45yJzU,650480,652959,if you like to stretch before exercising
5D86b45yJzU,652959,655839,the inchworm is a great dynamic option
5D86b45yJzU,655839,657680,start in a plank position
5D86b45yJzU,657680,659279,slowly walk your feet forward toward
5D86b45yJzU,659279,661600,your hands and drive your heels into the
5D86b45yJzU,661600,663440,ground so you feel a stretch in your
5D86b45yJzU,663440,666320,feet calves and hamstrings reset your
5D86b45yJzU,666320,670000,position and repeat for a few reps
5D86b45yJzU,670000,672240,in summary planar heel pain is
5D86b45yJzU,672240,673839,characterized by symptoms on the bottom
5D86b45yJzU,673839,676640,of the foot with standing walking
5D86b45yJzU,676640,678399,running or taking that first step in the
5D86b45yJzU,678399,679440,morning
5D86b45yJzU,679440,681760,it generally presents along a continuum
5D86b45yJzU,681760,684480,with runners on one end and older more
5D86b45yJzU,684480,686640,sedentary individuals with a higher body
5D86b45yJzU,686640,689040,mass index on the other end
5D86b45yJzU,689040,691120,since local inflammation isn't thought
5D86b45yJzU,691120,693360,to be the primary driving factor of the
5D86b45yJzU,693360,694399,condition
5D86b45yJzU,694399,695240,ice
5D86b45yJzU,695240,697760,anti-inflammatories and complete rest
5D86b45yJzU,697760,699680,are not recommended
5D86b45yJzU,699680,702399,contrary to popular belief managing
5D86b45yJzU,702399,704720,plantar heel pain is also not about
5D86b45yJzU,704720,706959,breaking up scar tissue removing heel
5D86b45yJzU,706959,709839,spurs or changing the structure of the
5D86b45yJzU,709839,710959,foot
5D86b45yJzU,710959,713360,you can roll your foot on a frozen water
5D86b45yJzU,713360,716160,bottle or lacrosse ball if it feels good
5D86b45yJzU,716160,717920,for you and doesn't take away from the
5D86b45yJzU,717920,720560,primary goals of rehab but neither are
5D86b45yJzU,720560,721920,needed
5D86b45yJzU,721920,724079,my core approach involves modifying
5D86b45yJzU,724079,725760,aggravating activities
5D86b45yJzU,725760,728079,keeping track of daily steps and
5D86b45yJzU,728079,729760,monitoring symptoms
5D86b45yJzU,729760,732480,and maintaining or progressing
5D86b45yJzU,732480,735760,tolerable physical activity over time
5D86b45yJzU,735760,738079,to aid with short-term relief planar
5D86b45yJzU,738079,740399,fascist stretching can be performed for
5D86b45yJzU,740399,743279,10 reps of 10 seconds after periods of
5D86b45yJzU,743279,745920,prolonged inactivity such as sleeping or
5D86b45yJzU,745920,746959,sitting
5D86b45yJzU,746959,749120,following this movement up for a minute
5D86b45yJzU,749120,752560,or two of toe curls and or toe yoga is
5D86b45yJzU,752560,753760,optional
5D86b45yJzU,753760,755519,to improve long term function of your
5D86b45yJzU,755519,757839,feet and ankles consider performing heel
5D86b45yJzU,757839,760079,raises every other day
5D86b45yJzU,760079,762000,incorporating the split squat and single
5D86b45yJzU,762000,763920,leg balance progressions to further
5D86b45yJzU,763920,766399,improve function are optional as well as
5D86b45yJzU,766399,768240,the inchworm as part of a dynamic
5D86b45yJzU,768240,769680,warm-up
5D86b45yJzU,769680,772079,regardless of what you decide to do it's
5D86b45yJzU,772079,774079,important to tailor the plan to your
5D86b45yJzU,774079,776639,individual goals and needs
5D86b45yJzU,776639,778639,there is no quick fix for planner heel
5D86b45yJzU,778639,781200,pain so it's helpful to set realistic
5D86b45yJzU,781200,784000,expectations and plan for the process to
5D86b45yJzU,784000,787040,take a minimum of three months
