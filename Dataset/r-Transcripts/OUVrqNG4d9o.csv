OUVrqNG4d9o,299,3868,- These are 10 new summer fast food secrets
OUVrqNG4d9o,3868,6779,to save you money in 2022.
OUVrqNG4d9o,6780,9371,And some of these hacks will save you serious cash
OUVrqNG4d9o,9371,12570,at your favorite fast food restaurants.
OUVrqNG4d9o,12570,15615,Secret number one will save you almost 50%
OUVrqNG4d9o,15616,19440,the next time you go to order a large pizza at Pizza Hut.
OUVrqNG4d9o,19440,22140,Here's how this Pizza Hut hack works.
OUVrqNG4d9o,22140,25289,If you were to order a regular Create Your Own pizza
OUVrqNG4d9o,25290,28470,it starts at 12.49 for this particular pizza.
OUVrqNG4d9o,28470,31470,And then you add the toppings which have additional fees.
OUVrqNG4d9o,31470,34800,"I added pepperoni, sausage, green bell peppers, and onions."
OUVrqNG4d9o,34800,36300,The total cost for the pizza
OUVrqNG4d9o,36300,40410,"with the toppings before tax, $20.49."
OUVrqNG4d9o,40410,42030,"The secret is, instead,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,42030,44370,"order the $10 Tastemaker pizza,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,44370,46410,which is also a large pizza
OUVrqNG4d9o,46410,49860,except this one includes up to three free toppings
OUVrqNG4d9o,49860,52740,and you can even opt to pay for additional toppings.
OUVrqNG4d9o,52740,54540,So I ordered the exact same ingredients
OUVrqNG4d9o,54540,55530,as the one I just showed you
OUVrqNG4d9o,55530,59850,"and the price for the exact same pizza before tax, $12."
OUVrqNG4d9o,59850,62340,That's an $8.50 discrepancy.
OUVrqNG4d9o,62340,64860,And that can certainly add up very quickly
OUVrqNG4d9o,64860,66720,if you're ordering multiple pizzas.
OUVrqNG4d9o,66720,69030,Here are the two pizzas side-by-side.
OUVrqNG4d9o,69030,71190,On the left is the Tastemaker.
OUVrqNG4d9o,71190,74070,And on the right is a virtually identical pizza
OUVrqNG4d9o,74070,76740,that would cost $8.50 more
OUVrqNG4d9o,76740,78900,if you did not know this trick.
OUVrqNG4d9o,78900,81780,"For secret number two, before I discuss Chick-fil-A,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,81780,82979,let's head over to Wendy's
OUVrqNG4d9o,82980,86610,where one of the most popular burgers is the Dave's Single.
OUVrqNG4d9o,86610,90420,Now this has a steeper price tag of $5.19
OUVrqNG4d9o,90420,92549,but there is a way around this.
OUVrqNG4d9o,92550,95340,"The hack is instead of ordering the Dave's Single,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,95340,97590,order a Double Stack at Wendy's
OUVrqNG4d9o,97590,100350,and add tomatoes and lettuce to it
OUVrqNG4d9o,100350,103979,and you essentially get a Dave's Single for more than $2
OUVrqNG4d9o,103980,106890,less with an additional patty.
OUVrqNG4d9o,106890,108780,Here they are side-by-side.
OUVrqNG4d9o,108780,112080,On the left is the Double Stack for $3.09.
OUVrqNG4d9o,112080,116400,And on the right is the Dave's Single for $5.19.
OUVrqNG4d9o,116400,120300,Perhaps the bun with the Dave's Single is around 10% larger
OUVrqNG4d9o,120300,121830,"but ordering the double stack,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,121830,124380,"you get an extra burger, more protein."
OUVrqNG4d9o,124380,127049,So I'd say the overall difference is negligible.
OUVrqNG4d9o,127050,129330,Secret number three is tied to Chick-fil-A.
OUVrqNG4d9o,129330,131850,If you frequently find yourself at this restaurant
OUVrqNG4d9o,131850,135030,"but also craving a McFlurry from McDonald's,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,135030,137520,you can now have your cake and eat it too.
OUVrqNG4d9o,137520,140010,This hack will score you the Chick-fil-A equivalent
OUVrqNG4d9o,140010,143340,of the McFlurry and you get a full meal with it.
OUVrqNG4d9o,143340,144540,Here's how it works.
OUVrqNG4d9o,144540,147269,You can do this in person or at the drive through
OUVrqNG4d9o,147270,148290,as I did.
OUVrqNG4d9o,148290,150930,"Order a Chick-fil-A kids meal of your choice,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,150930,153540,"which is a substantial portion to begin with,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,153540,156480,and then ask the person taking your order
OUVrqNG4d9o,156480,160260,to substitute an ice cream cup in place of the toy.
OUVrqNG4d9o,160260,163920,And then ask for them to put cookie crumbles on top.
OUVrqNG4d9o,163920,166709,Sometimes the person taking your order will bless you
OUVrqNG4d9o,166710,168000,with free cookie crumbles.
OUVrqNG4d9o,168000,171000,"And sometimes they'll apply a charge of 30 cents more,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,171000,172680,but here's what you end up with.
OUVrqNG4d9o,172680,174359,"You get fries, a drink."
OUVrqNG4d9o,174360,175890,I chose a meal of nuggets.
OUVrqNG4d9o,175890,179940,And you get this sizeable Oreo McFlurry equivalent.
OUVrqNG4d9o,179940,181830,"I'm an Oreo lover to begin with,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,181830,184080,and this tasted the same if not better
OUVrqNG4d9o,184080,186510,than the Oreo McFlurry from McDonald's.
OUVrqNG4d9o,186510,189689,The Chick-fil-A cost $5.69
OUVrqNG4d9o,189690,191421,including the meal and dessert.
OUVrqNG4d9o,191421,195870,Just over $2 more than the price of a regular McFlurry
OUVrqNG4d9o,195870,198599,from McDonald's where you do not get the whole meal.
OUVrqNG4d9o,198600,200640,"By the way, if you love Chick-fil-A,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,200640,203010,you won't wanna miss the bonus section of this video
OUVrqNG4d9o,203010,206099,where I have a very provocative Chick-fil-A hack.
OUVrqNG4d9o,206100,209700,Fast food secret number four is tied to Raising Cane's.
OUVrqNG4d9o,209700,211668,And if your family is a big fan of the popular
OUVrqNG4d9o,211669,215280,"Three Finger Combo, which is typically what my wife and I"
OUVrqNG4d9o,215280,217020,"each order when we visit,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,217020,221130,you could save at least $2.30 by simply doing this trick.
OUVrqNG4d9o,221130,224820,"All you have to do is order the Caniac Combo,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,224820,227296,"which includes six chicken strips, French fries,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,227296,230280,"two Cane sauces, and a side of coleslaw."
OUVrqNG4d9o,230280,232830,"And then, assuming you don't want coleslaw,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,232830,235680,"which is not included on the Three Finger Combo,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,235680,239519,ask the person taking your order to substitute the coleslaw
OUVrqNG4d9o,239520,241530,and give you some extra fries.
OUVrqNG4d9o,241530,244560,Your result is the equivalent of two
OUVrqNG4d9o,244560,249560,Three Finger Combo meals for around $2.30 less.
OUVrqNG4d9o,250080,253440,On the left of the screen is the regular three piece combo
OUVrqNG4d9o,253440,255930,"which I was ordering two of in the past,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,255930,258750,and on the right is the Caniac Combo
OUVrqNG4d9o,258750,261989,which is what my wife and I will be ordering from now on.
OUVrqNG4d9o,261989,263400,"And I'm sure you all know this,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,263400,265229,but I should mention the hardworking
OUVrqNG4d9o,265230,268110,fast food employees need our patience and respect.
OUVrqNG4d9o,268110,270150,"With all of these hacks, your results could vary."
OUVrqNG4d9o,270150,271979,And the amount of money you could save
OUVrqNG4d9o,271980,275490,is not worth an altercation or ruining someone's day.
OUVrqNG4d9o,275490,278340,"Fast food secret number five is tied to the beloved,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,278340,281580,"very popular Jimmy John's French bread,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,281580,284460,"upon which they serve their sandwiches, that you can buy"
OUVrqNG4d9o,284460,287250,for a fraction of what you would pay at the grocery store.
OUVrqNG4d9o,287250,290550,You could make your own DIY sandwiches or garlic bread.
OUVrqNG4d9o,290550,291569,Here's the trick.
OUVrqNG4d9o,291570,293910,"The next time you're at a Jimmy John's location,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,293910,295380,go in the morning or late at night
OUVrqNG4d9o,295380,296790,"and ask for their bread,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,296790,299880,which by this point is barely even a day old.
OUVrqNG4d9o,299880,302880,And what most people don't know is they will sell it
OUVrqNG4d9o,302880,305280,to you without even batting an eye.
OUVrqNG4d9o,305280,309030,"At some locations for their 16 inch French bread loaf,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,309030,310920,they might charge you a 25 cents.
OUVrqNG4d9o,310920,314580,"At my location, I scored 16 inches of their bread"
OUVrqNG4d9o,314580,315870,for 50 cents.
OUVrqNG4d9o,315870,318360,I can now use this hack to make my daughter
OUVrqNG4d9o,318360,320039,special treat school lunches.
OUVrqNG4d9o,320040,322350,We've got garlic bread for pasta night.
OUVrqNG4d9o,322350,325650,"If you're not in the mood for that DIY sandwich route,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,325650,328259,"over at Subway, there are some superb"
OUVrqNG4d9o,328260,331050,summer coupons to bring you substantial savings.
OUVrqNG4d9o,331050,333810,There's currently a coupon to get you a free
OUVrqNG4d9o,333810,336150,buy one get one foot long from subway
OUVrqNG4d9o,336150,339000,or 15% off a regular foot long.
OUVrqNG4d9o,339000,340560,"The coupons, which you can see"
OUVrqNG4d9o,340560,343860,I took advantage of resulted in substantial savings
OUVrqNG4d9o,343860,345930,for this order that I have right here.
OUVrqNG4d9o,345930,346970,I've linked to the coupons
OUVrqNG4d9o,346971,349080,which are in the video description box.
OUVrqNG4d9o,349080,352169,Fast food secret number six is tied to Dairy Queen.
OUVrqNG4d9o,352170,354570,And not a lot of people know that the burger portion
OUVrqNG4d9o,354570,357480,in the kids meal is the exact same size
OUVrqNG4d9o,357480,359520,as what you would find in the adult meal.
OUVrqNG4d9o,359520,360780,"But using this trick,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,360780,364500,you'll save more than $2 and get a free Dilly Bar.
OUVrqNG4d9o,364500,366090,This is what you need to do.
OUVrqNG4d9o,366090,367830,"Order a cheeseburger kids meal,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,367830,371460,"and ask for a soda in place of the milk or bottled water,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,371460,372509,which is free.
OUVrqNG4d9o,372510,377010,"Your total cost before tax, $5.39."
OUVrqNG4d9o,377010,380370,"You get a full size burger, fries, a smaller drink,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,380370,383880,"which you could always refill, and a Dilly Bar."
OUVrqNG4d9o,383880,385650,You'll see I ordered the kids meal
OUVrqNG4d9o,385650,388620,on the left for 5.39 before tax
OUVrqNG4d9o,388620,390660,and the adult meal which is on the right
OUVrqNG4d9o,390660,392490,for 7.49 before tax.
OUVrqNG4d9o,392490,394380,The burger size is identical.
OUVrqNG4d9o,394380,397290,And even the French fry portion is comparable.
OUVrqNG4d9o,397290,399330,Plus I scored the Dilly Bar.
OUVrqNG4d9o,399330,400830,"What's even crazier,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,400830,402389,"you can tell I don't get out much,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,402390,404490,is the same hack also applies
OUVrqNG4d9o,404490,406860,to the very popular burger chain Freddy's
OUVrqNG4d9o,406860,409620,and there you'll save more than $3.
OUVrqNG4d9o,409620,410729,Here's what to do
OUVrqNG4d9o,410730,412080,if you live near a Freddy's
OUVrqNG4d9o,412080,414689,or you're on a road trip and find yourself near one.
OUVrqNG4d9o,414690,419100,Order the kids cheeseburger combo for $5.39.
OUVrqNG4d9o,419100,422790,"Now, to make this the exact same as the adult version,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,422790,425640,"which is called the Single Steak Burger Combo,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,425640,428460,ask the person taking your order to add mustard
OUVrqNG4d9o,428460,431370,"and onion to the kids burger, which is free of charge,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,431370,432654,and this is what happens.
OUVrqNG4d9o,432654,435930,"On the left, you'll see the kids meal for 5.39"
OUVrqNG4d9o,435930,439979,and the adult version on the right for 8.59 before tax.
OUVrqNG4d9o,439980,441720,The burgers are identical.
OUVrqNG4d9o,441720,443910,You'll note the drink is definitely smaller
OUVrqNG4d9o,443910,446670,"on the kids version, but you get free refills."
OUVrqNG4d9o,446670,448050,And amazingly enough
OUVrqNG4d9o,448050,451169,"the French fries are the exact same size,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,451170,453570,"as well as the burgers, for both meals."
OUVrqNG4d9o,453570,455760,"Before I get to my next point, I should mention"
OUVrqNG4d9o,455760,458550,"I am not advocating to eat fast food every day,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,458550,461250,"but sometimes for convenience, you're pressed for time,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,461250,463560,"you're on a family road trip, it's a special treat,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,463560,465660,some of the savings tied to each of these tips
OUVrqNG4d9o,465660,467460,does add up substantially.
OUVrqNG4d9o,467460,469319,Even just a few uses.
OUVrqNG4d9o,469320,472680,Fast food secret number seven is tied to those surveys
OUVrqNG4d9o,472680,474720,that many of us throw out on the receipts.
OUVrqNG4d9o,474720,476010,You've likely seen the survey
OUVrqNG4d9o,476010,479460,at the bottom promising you some type of free item.
OUVrqNG4d9o,479460,481560,And as you can see from all of the receipts
OUVrqNG4d9o,481560,484530,"I've cultivated from just researching this video,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,484530,488130,countless free food items are being promised.
OUVrqNG4d9o,488130,490590,Many of us are dissuaded from having to sign up
OUVrqNG4d9o,490590,491639,with an email address
OUVrqNG4d9o,491640,493530,or give out a piece of personal information
OUVrqNG4d9o,493530,496080,and risk being spammed forever.
OUVrqNG4d9o,496080,496913,But don't worry.
OUVrqNG4d9o,496913,499320,There's actually a hack around that.
OUVrqNG4d9o,499320,501570,"Did you know, Apple has a built-in feature"
OUVrqNG4d9o,501570,503010,to its mail program
OUVrqNG4d9o,503010,505980,"where it will give you a temporary email address,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,505980,507720,which you can use to receive email
OUVrqNG4d9o,507720,509730,and then deactivate whenever you choose.
OUVrqNG4d9o,509730,512250,Perhaps after you get that free coupon code.
OUVrqNG4d9o,512250,513870,"And if you're an Android user,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,513870,515669,there are equivalents which I've linked to
OUVrqNG4d9o,515669,517409,in the video description box below.
OUVrqNG4d9o,517409,518669,In the number eight spot.
OUVrqNG4d9o,518669,520349,If you find yourself at Burger King
OUVrqNG4d9o,520349,524130,"and you just can't decide between fries and onion rings,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,524130,526530,there is a trick to get around that.
OUVrqNG4d9o,526530,530400,"Just ask for half and half, sometimes dubbed Frings,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,530400,532290,"fries and onion rings,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,532290,533790,and most store associates
OUVrqNG4d9o,533790,535920,or drive through employees will be happy to give you
OUVrqNG4d9o,535920,538560,half and half for no additional fees.
OUVrqNG4d9o,538560,540360,I went to put this hack to the test
OUVrqNG4d9o,540360,543240,and at the drive through I ordered a medium fries
OUVrqNG4d9o,543240,544529,and then I asked them to fill it
OUVrqNG4d9o,544530,546870,half with fries and half with onion rings.
OUVrqNG4d9o,546870,549833,It took me 10 seconds longer to make this request.
OUVrqNG4d9o,549833,553200,The person taking my order wasn't the least bit bothered.
OUVrqNG4d9o,553200,555480,And I got the benefit of not having to decide
OUVrqNG4d9o,555480,557370,between fries and onion rings
OUVrqNG4d9o,557370,558720,for this special treat
OUVrqNG4d9o,558720,561149,where I can now enjoy both.
OUVrqNG4d9o,561150,562890,"In a moment, I've got another hack"
OUVrqNG4d9o,562890,565080,that I am convinced will blow your mind.
OUVrqNG4d9o,565080,566850,"But first, for my next point,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,566850,568620,many of us think of fast food apps
OUVrqNG4d9o,568620,571080,as just another way to clutter up our smartphone
OUVrqNG4d9o,571080,573192,or another way to place an order.
OUVrqNG4d9o,573192,575940,But if you've not yet downloaded an app
OUVrqNG4d9o,575940,577740,"for your favorite fast food restaurant,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,577740,579750,"my goodness, are you missing out"
OUVrqNG4d9o,579750,583770,on some serious freebies this summer and beyond.
OUVrqNG4d9o,583770,587250,"From free fries at McDonald's to half price drinks at Sonic,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,587250,588810,"which I'm offered regularly,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,588810,591300,to the incredible amount of free items
OUVrqNG4d9o,591300,593910,Chick-fil-A seems desperate to offer me
OUVrqNG4d9o,593910,596100,through their app on a regular basis.
OUVrqNG4d9o,596100,599190,It pays to have their app on your smartphone.
OUVrqNG4d9o,599190,601020,Another piece of insider info.
OUVrqNG4d9o,601020,603120,PayPal has a rotating carousel
OUVrqNG4d9o,603120,605641,of discounts tied to your favorite fast food restaurants
OUVrqNG4d9o,605642,607380,that many people never see.
OUVrqNG4d9o,607380,610230,In the past it's been 20% off McDonald's gift cards.
OUVrqNG4d9o,610230,612120,And today for this particular moment
OUVrqNG4d9o,612120,613500,where I'm recording the video
OUVrqNG4d9o,613500,616290,Red Robin gift cards are 20% off.
OUVrqNG4d9o,616290,618060,I've created a link to these deals
OUVrqNG4d9o,618060,619860,in the video description box below.
OUVrqNG4d9o,619860,621839,"For my next fast food secret,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,621840,624150,"before I get to the controversial bonus section,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,624150,627420,hot dogs remain one of the most popular fast food items.
OUVrqNG4d9o,627420,629310,"But as I'm sure you can all relate,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,629310,631800,not all hot dogs are created equal.
OUVrqNG4d9o,631800,635430,with portion sizes seemingly smaller than ever before
OUVrqNG4d9o,635430,637920,and prices way too high.
OUVrqNG4d9o,637920,639600,"There's a huge hotdog hack,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,639600,640680,"which I'll now share with you,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,640680,641970,"and just to preface this,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,641970,644188,I had to drive around with several hotdogs
OUVrqNG4d9o,644188,646950,in the trunk of my car for several miles
OUVrqNG4d9o,646950,648720,like a bit of a crazy person
OUVrqNG4d9o,648720,651269,just to put this research to the test.
OUVrqNG4d9o,651270,655260,Costco and Sam's Club have some of the largest size hot dogs
OUVrqNG4d9o,655260,658410,"for a 1.50 each, where you also get a free drink"
OUVrqNG4d9o,658410,660870,"and no, you do not need to be a member."
OUVrqNG4d9o,660870,664680,I'll compare the Sam's and Costco dogs to the major chains
OUVrqNG4d9o,664680,666960,"in a moment, but not many people know"
OUVrqNG4d9o,666960,669780,you do not need a membership to make use
OUVrqNG4d9o,669780,672660,of the Sam's Club or Costco food courts.
OUVrqNG4d9o,672660,675120,Simply walk in through the exit door
OUVrqNG4d9o,675120,677550,instead of the entry door and head straight
OUVrqNG4d9o,677550,678690,to the food court.
OUVrqNG4d9o,678690,682020,This is what a Sam's Club hot dog looks like.
OUVrqNG4d9o,682020,684450,And this is the Costco one.
OUVrqNG4d9o,684450,686280,Each are 1.50.
OUVrqNG4d9o,686280,688890,"Now to compare this, I bought every possible hot dog"
OUVrqNG4d9o,688890,692040,I could find from three major fast food restaurants
OUVrqNG4d9o,692040,694320,to highlight the size differential.
OUVrqNG4d9o,694320,696360,Let's start with Dairy Queen.
OUVrqNG4d9o,696360,697953,Their hot dog $3.29.
OUVrqNG4d9o,699210,701430,"And as you can see, compared to the Sam's Club"
OUVrqNG4d9o,701430,704220,"on the left and the Costco hot dog in the middle,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,704220,707879,the DQ hot dog is not worth more than double the price.
OUVrqNG4d9o,707880,711510,"And again, from DQ, you do not get a free drink."
OUVrqNG4d9o,711510,713190,Let's look at Sonic.
OUVrqNG4d9o,713190,715800,"Their All American Dog is 2.59,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,715800,718110,which is at least cheaper than Dairy Queen.
OUVrqNG4d9o,718110,719700,And despite being buried
OUVrqNG4d9o,719700,721830,"under some nice complimentary relish,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,721830,726150,it's tiny by comparison to both Sam's and Costco.
OUVrqNG4d9o,726150,728730,"And don't even get me started on Five Guys,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,728730,732089,"where for a whopping $5.99,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,732090,734640,their hot dog is way smaller.
OUVrqNG4d9o,734640,738990,"And despite the unlimited toppings offered by Five Guys,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,738990,742520,it is definitely not worth an extra $4.50
OUVrqNG4d9o,742520,744960,"in my opinion, based on its size"
OUVrqNG4d9o,744960,747120,compared to Sam's or Costco.
OUVrqNG4d9o,747120,750000,I'm classifying this next hack as a bonus
OUVrqNG4d9o,750000,751830,"because it's controversial,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,751830,753720,although it did work to my amazement.
OUVrqNG4d9o,753720,756839,"This next hack is from the comment section of a prior video,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,756840,759840,and it's a way to score you a free bacon add-on
OUVrqNG4d9o,759840,762090,to your favorite Chick-fil-A sandwich
OUVrqNG4d9o,762090,763770,without any additional fees.
OUVrqNG4d9o,763770,765150,Here's how it works.
OUVrqNG4d9o,765150,768180,And this can only be done through the mobile app.
OUVrqNG4d9o,768180,769740,When you are ordering a sandwich
OUVrqNG4d9o,769740,772200,"and you're presented with the extras section,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,772200,774270,"where you can customize a sandwich,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,774270,776940,you are given the option to purchase bacon
OUVrqNG4d9o,776940,780930,for $1.34 extra added to your order.
OUVrqNG4d9o,780930,783300,The hack is to skip this section
OUVrqNG4d9o,783300,785730,and instead scroll down the page
OUVrqNG4d9o,785730,788621,below the extras where there's an additional section
OUVrqNG4d9o,788621,790386,for special instructions
OUVrqNG4d9o,790386,795386,and simply type in the word bacon and then place your order.
OUVrqNG4d9o,795720,799079,"Miraculously, when I received my order at the drive through"
OUVrqNG4d9o,799080,802950,"and I checked my sandwich, it had bacon added to it"
OUVrqNG4d9o,802950,807330,and they did not ask me to pay the additional $1.34.
OUVrqNG4d9o,807330,809400,I'm not sure if this hack is a fluke
OUVrqNG4d9o,809400,810990,"or if it will soon get patched,"
OUVrqNG4d9o,810990,812820,but I did wanna put it to the test
OUVrqNG4d9o,812820,814710,and I'll leave the rest up to you.
OUVrqNG4d9o,814710,817770,This final fast food hack is tied to Starbucks.
OUVrqNG4d9o,817770,820830,And also from a subscriber who mentioned this final hack
OUVrqNG4d9o,820830,822120,is a way to treat her kids
OUVrqNG4d9o,822120,824310,to a Starbucks dessert experience
OUVrqNG4d9o,824310,825720,when times are tough.
OUVrqNG4d9o,825720,828480,"She says, simply ask any barista"
OUVrqNG4d9o,828480,830730,for a side of whipped cream and they will
OUVrqNG4d9o,830730,833040,most of the time give it to you for free
OUVrqNG4d9o,833040,835050,with no issue in a cup.
OUVrqNG4d9o,835050,838050,Kind of like a little Starbucks branded dessert
OUVrqNG4d9o,838050,842100,so your kids could have that experience if you so choose.
OUVrqNG4d9o,842100,844769,I'd like to thank you for choosing to watch this video.
OUVrqNG4d9o,844770,846600,If you've got a fast food hack that you wanna share
OUVrqNG4d9o,846600,848940,please leave it in the comment section.
OUVrqNG4d9o,848940,851373,"And it until next time, I love you. Bye bye."
