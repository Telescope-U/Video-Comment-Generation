GVUyvZfzlXw,53280,55440,gaming monitor now you might be

GVUyvZfzlXw,58239,60800,things for the pc world well it's
GVUyvZfzlXw,60800,63199,actually interesting so there's sony
GVUyvZfzlXw,63199,65518,interactive entertainment which is like
GVUyvZfzlXw,65518,67680,the playstation side of things and then
GVUyvZfzlXw,67680,69920,there's sony electronics so sony
GVUyvZfzlXw,69920,72720,electronics manufactures all of the
GVUyvZfzlXw,72720,74880,sony headphones
GVUyvZfzlXw,74880,77840,walkman all the sony stuff that
GVUyvZfzlXw,77840,79439,they still make those jay they just
GVUyvZfzlXw,79439,80720,dropped them they just dropped another
GVUyvZfzlXw,80720,82560,one like a couple weeks ago but yeah the
GVUyvZfzlXw,82560,86880,wh 1000x mark fives all those that sony
GVUyvZfzlXw,86880,88240,electronics
GVUyvZfzlXw,88240,90159,sony interactive entertainment makes
GVUyvZfzlXw,90159,92240,playstation stuff but now with this
GVUyvZfzlXw,92240,94880,endzone brand it's kind of like
GVUyvZfzlXw,94880,96960,merging the two worlds together i always
GVUyvZfzlXw,96960,100000,wondered why the wh 1000x didn't work
GVUyvZfzlXw,100000,102240,for playstation it just felt like
GVUyvZfzlXw,102240,103680,they're all sony it should just make
GVUyvZfzlXw,103680,106479,sense um but like i said this is going
GVUyvZfzlXw,106479,108079,to be bridging the gap between like
GVUyvZfzlXw,108079,109840,those two sides
GVUyvZfzlXw,109840,112000,but enough talking enough background
GVUyvZfzlXw,112000,114000,let's take a look at these products okay
GVUyvZfzlXw,114000,116079,so we'll start off with the wired
GVUyvZfzlXw,116079,118960,version these are the h3s now i'm not
GVUyvZfzlXw,118960,120560,gonna lie i'm pretty excited for this
GVUyvZfzlXw,120560,122719,whole in zone product line
GVUyvZfzlXw,122719,125040,because sony has so much experience when
GVUyvZfzlXw,125040,126840,it comes to
GVUyvZfzlXw,126840,128399,headphones
GVUyvZfzlXw,128399,130720,tvs and we're going to see a lot of the
GVUyvZfzlXw,130720,132800,technology that they use for like the
GVUyvZfzlXw,132800,135520,1000x or even their television line
GVUyvZfzlXw,135520,137680,trickle down into some of these more
GVUyvZfzlXw,137680,139680,gaming focused products all right so
GVUyvZfzlXw,139680,143040,these are the h3s you have the ear cups
GVUyvZfzlXw,143040,144800,that can come down like i said these are
GVUyvZfzlXw,144800,147520,the wired versions so these are the h3s
GVUyvZfzlXw,147520,149040,there's some paperwork
GVUyvZfzlXw,149040,151040,as well as
GVUyvZfzlXw,151040,153519,some stickers and you get your adapter
GVUyvZfzlXw,153519,155280,if you want to go ahead and plug this
GVUyvZfzlXw,155280,158480,into your pc or computer okay so that's
GVUyvZfzlXw,158480,161200,the h3 but let's take a look at the
GVUyvZfzlXw,161200,165040,bigger brother this is the h9 so this is
GVUyvZfzlXw,165040,166560,the top-of-the-line version this is the
GVUyvZfzlXw,166560,170879,h9 now the h7 is also a wireless headset
GVUyvZfzlXw,170879,173920,with bluetooth um but it does not have
GVUyvZfzlXw,173920,176400,active noise cancellation and
GVUyvZfzlXw,176400,179360,you know more paperwork stickers got our
GVUyvZfzlXw,179360,182959,usbc to a cable the dongle so you can go
GVUyvZfzlXw,182959,186159,ahead and plug this into your ps5 or
GVUyvZfzlXw,186159,188400,your pc and it just has a little switch
GVUyvZfzlXw,188400,189840,so you can pick which kind of console
GVUyvZfzlXw,189840,192879,you're using and these are the h9s very
GVUyvZfzlXw,192879,195519,similar look to the h3s
GVUyvZfzlXw,195519,198159,but one big difference here are actually
GVUyvZfzlXw,198159,200879,on the ear cups so the same leather that
GVUyvZfzlXw,200879,204879,we see with the 1000x mark 5s which are
GVUyvZfzlXw,204879,207360,really soft and very comfortable you
GVUyvZfzlXw,207360,209920,have that here whereas the h3 has like a
GVUyvZfzlXw,209920,212879,more plush fabric kind of feel to it but
GVUyvZfzlXw,212879,215120,yeah these are the h9s and listen i've
GVUyvZfzlXw,215120,219120,tried these already spoiler alert
GVUyvZfzlXw,219120,220959,they're pretty good all right that's
GVUyvZfzlXw,220959,223920,what we've got for the gaming headset
GVUyvZfzlXw,223920,227840,now let's take a look at the monitor
GVUyvZfzlXw,228080,232560,screws power brick power cable
GVUyvZfzlXw,232560,236560,we've got our stand legs
GVUyvZfzlXw,236640,238959,it's coming
GVUyvZfzlXw,238959,242319,and our monitor and
GVUyvZfzlXw,242319,244360,right here we've got our
GVUyvZfzlXw,244360,247519,m9 gaming monitor and one thing you'll
GVUyvZfzlXw,247519,250560,notice guys these definitely fit the
GVUyvZfzlXw,250560,253840,aesthetic of a ps5 even though these are
GVUyvZfzlXw,253840,258799,gaming pc and ps5 oriented uh
GVUyvZfzlXw,258799,261199,aesthetically they follow the same ps5
GVUyvZfzlXw,261199,263840,design it fits right in
GVUyvZfzlXw,263840,265759,dang you guys
GVUyvZfzlXw,265759,268639,we went and did purple for the boxes
GVUyvZfzlXw,268639,270880,but the products are white
GVUyvZfzlXw,270880,272560,we're gonna have to swap this again so
GVUyvZfzlXw,272560,274240,clearly design wise i think these look
GVUyvZfzlXw,274240,277520,awesome this is a 27 inch display
GVUyvZfzlXw,277520,281759,now this is 4k and has a 144 hertz
GVUyvZfzlXw,281759,283280,refresh rate now what makes this thing a
GVUyvZfzlXw,283280,284560,little bit different compared to a lot
GVUyvZfzlXw,284560,286080,of what you'll see on the market right
GVUyvZfzlXw,286080,288800,now is that it has full array local
GVUyvZfzlXw,288800,290400,dimming you know what before i show you
GVUyvZfzlXw,290400,291919,guys what i wanted to show you we do
GVUyvZfzlXw,291919,293759,have to talk about port selection here
GVUyvZfzlXw,293759,297199,so we're looking at two hdmi 2.1 ports
GVUyvZfzlXw,297199,299280,of course playstation you know you need
GVUyvZfzlXw,299280,302240,that you got a displayport usbc one of
GVUyvZfzlXw,302240,303919,those funky
GVUyvZfzlXw,303919,306160,usb big i don't even know what they call
GVUyvZfzlXw,306160,308320,this one it's the big usb port as well
GVUyvZfzlXw,308320,310800,as three usb 3.0 ports
GVUyvZfzlXw,310800,311680,so
GVUyvZfzlXw,311680,313680,all the ports you need so let's get into
GVUyvZfzlXw,313680,315520,it let's get this baby set up
GVUyvZfzlXw,315520,318639,get some gaming going all right guys so
GVUyvZfzlXw,318639,320560,we've been playing around with the new
GVUyvZfzlXw,320560,322560,gear we've got it all sprawled out on
GVUyvZfzlXw,322560,325199,the table like we said before
GVUyvZfzlXw,325199,328320,these all work with the pc as well as
GVUyvZfzlXw,328320,330800,the ps5 and we had some time to spend
GVUyvZfzlXw,330800,332800,with both of them kind of see how they
GVUyvZfzlXw,332800,336160,operate on both sides i gotta say
GVUyvZfzlXw,336160,337759,pretty happy with the performance so
GVUyvZfzlXw,337759,339600,first let's talk about the gaming
GVUyvZfzlXw,339600,342560,headsets and i'm not gonna lie these are
GVUyvZfzlXw,342560,345280,exactly what i feel like sony intended
GVUyvZfzlXw,345280,348000,these to be some new high-end gaming
GVUyvZfzlXw,348000,349680,headsets but i think all of them are
GVUyvZfzlXw,349680,352639,gonna be really great options for ps5
GVUyvZfzlXw,352639,354720,owners now there's a lot of good stuff
GVUyvZfzlXw,354720,356479,that sony's doing here this kind of
GVUyvZfzlXw,356479,358720,falls in line with the design like i
GVUyvZfzlXw,358720,360960,said before of the ps5 we've got the
GVUyvZfzlXw,360960,363440,white and the black these just feel a
GVUyvZfzlXw,363440,365680,lot more premium than the pulse right
GVUyvZfzlXw,365680,367759,now and it makes sense with the higher
GVUyvZfzlXw,367759,369199,price tag
GVUyvZfzlXw,369199,371919,this essentially is as if
GVUyvZfzlXw,371919,376080,the pulse and a pair of 1000x mark fives
GVUyvZfzlXw,376080,378479,came together had a baby
GVUyvZfzlXw,378479,381600,and then boom we got the h9 so the h9s
GVUyvZfzlXw,381600,383680,are absolutely awesome but if you don't
GVUyvZfzlXw,383680,386000,want to spend the money the h3s are
GVUyvZfzlXw,386000,387840,really good wired option
GVUyvZfzlXw,387840,390160,but of course you know they're wired and
GVUyvZfzlXw,390160,391520,they're missing some of the features
GVUyvZfzlXw,391520,394800,that you get with the h7 or the h9 so
GVUyvZfzlXw,394800,397520,for a 99 gaming headset i actually like
GVUyvZfzlXw,397520,400479,these a lot i like the audio quality uh
GVUyvZfzlXw,400479,402720,and sony's done a couple of things here
GVUyvZfzlXw,402720,404240,to make sure that the audio quality
GVUyvZfzlXw,404240,406479,comes in pretty well uh even with the
GVUyvZfzlXw,406479,408720,design so you'll notice that these are
GVUyvZfzlXw,408720,410080,pretty
GVUyvZfzlXw,410080,412160,rounded ear cups especially when it
GVUyvZfzlXw,412160,414400,comes to the actual body itself this
GVUyvZfzlXw,414400,416160,design even though it's a little bit on
GVUyvZfzlXw,416160,418639,the larger side it's very intentional to
GVUyvZfzlXw,418639,420400,help with that spatial sound especially
GVUyvZfzlXw,420400,421840,when it comes to these higher end models
GVUyvZfzlXw,421840,424240,since they support that 360 spatial
GVUyvZfzlXw,424240,426800,audio so i really like what they've done
GVUyvZfzlXw,426800,428639,with these i like the sound quality they
GVUyvZfzlXw,428639,431199,definitely sound premium um when
GVUyvZfzlXw,431199,432720,compared to something like the pulse
GVUyvZfzlXw,432720,433680,that
GVUyvZfzlXw,433680,436560,is the only first party headset so far
GVUyvZfzlXw,436560,438720,for the playstation these will
GVUyvZfzlXw,438720,441599,definitely be a really nice upgrade i
GVUyvZfzlXw,441599,443199,feel like these sound better than the
GVUyvZfzlXw,443199,445440,pulse as well and these support some of
GVUyvZfzlXw,445440,447199,those special features that we saw with
GVUyvZfzlXw,447199,449440,the pulse headset like that 3d audio and
GVUyvZfzlXw,449440,450240,you'll also get those little
GVUyvZfzlXw,450240,453599,notification indicators on screen so if
GVUyvZfzlXw,453599,455840,you turn on your mic
GVUyvZfzlXw,455840,457840,you can see that turn on if you want to
GVUyvZfzlXw,457840,459440,control your volume
GVUyvZfzlXw,459440,461520,you'll see those come on as well and
GVUyvZfzlXw,461520,463840,like we saw in the unboxing these use a
GVUyvZfzlXw,463840,466560,dongle to connect with the ps5 give you
GVUyvZfzlXw,466560,468639,access to all of those features but they
GVUyvZfzlXw,468639,470800,also have bluetooth so if you want to go
GVUyvZfzlXw,470800,473280,ahead and connect your phone you can use
GVUyvZfzlXw,473280,475360,these as a pair of bluetooth headphones
GVUyvZfzlXw,475360,477199,uh you can take calls with them all that
GVUyvZfzlXw,477199,479599,good stuff but what's really nice is
GVUyvZfzlXw,479599,482240,that these can actually pair between the
GVUyvZfzlXw,482240,484639,two devices at the same time so right
GVUyvZfzlXw,484639,487520,now you can see from the led indicator
GVUyvZfzlXw,487520,490240,that it's blinking white and blue
GVUyvZfzlXw,490240,492240,white shows that it's connected to the
GVUyvZfzlXw,492240,495120,ps5 blue shows that it's connected to my
GVUyvZfzlXw,495120,496080,phone
GVUyvZfzlXw,496080,498720,so you actually are able to hear both
GVUyvZfzlXw,498720,501759,audio sources at the exact same time and
GVUyvZfzlXw,501759,503360,if you're wondering about how volume
GVUyvZfzlXw,503360,505680,control works between the two uh the
GVUyvZfzlXw,505680,508240,volume dial that you have here on the
GVUyvZfzlXw,508240,510560,headset will control the volume for the
GVUyvZfzlXw,510560,512240,ps5 and if you want to control the
GVUyvZfzlXw,512240,513518,volume on
GVUyvZfzlXw,513518,514800,your phone
GVUyvZfzlXw,514800,516240,you just do it from your phone and the
GVUyvZfzlXw,516240,518080,one thing that sets this apart from
GVUyvZfzlXw,518080,520800,something like the h7 is the active
GVUyvZfzlXw,520800,522399,noise cancelling which is
GVUyvZfzlXw,522399,524720,really solid on here uh it sounds really
GVUyvZfzlXw,524720,526959,good it has the ambient mode which is
GVUyvZfzlXw,526959,528880,pretty decent you're able to hear people
GVUyvZfzlXw,528880,530320,that are around you if someone tries to
GVUyvZfzlXw,530320,532399,speak to you as long as your game volume
GVUyvZfzlXw,532399,535279,isn't crazy high great battery life 32
GVUyvZfzlXw,535279,537760,hours with active noise cancelling on
GVUyvZfzlXw,537760,540080,the h7s have 40 hours of battery life
GVUyvZfzlXw,540080,542720,either way i love these i think these
GVUyvZfzlXw,542720,546000,are great it's what the ps5 was missing
GVUyvZfzlXw,546000,548640,these guys the 300 bucks
GVUyvZfzlXw,548640,551680,really really expensive um if you don't
GVUyvZfzlXw,551680,554000,care for active noise canceling you can
GVUyvZfzlXw,554000,556320,always go with the h7s and i'll be
GVUyvZfzlXw,556320,559440,honest i feel like the h7s are probably
GVUyvZfzlXw,559440,561040,the sweet spot
GVUyvZfzlXw,561040,562959,active noise cancelling on these are
GVUyvZfzlXw,562959,564800,pretty good
GVUyvZfzlXw,564800,566720,but when i'm playing the game if i turn
GVUyvZfzlXw,566720,569440,it on or off i'm not seeing a really big
GVUyvZfzlXw,569440,571920,difference for just the gaming side of
GVUyvZfzlXw,571920,573600,things i feel like a lot of people are
GVUyvZfzlXw,573600,575120,going to be able to get by with just the
GVUyvZfzlXw,575120,577600,h7s you don't have to fork over the
GVUyvZfzlXw,577600,580240,extras what is it 70 bucks for the
GVUyvZfzlXw,580240,582080,feature these are still first party
GVUyvZfzlXw,582080,583279,right even though they've got the
GVUyvZfzlXw,583279,585519,endzone brand they're still made by sony
GVUyvZfzlXw,585519,587440,and they have all of the
GVUyvZfzlXw,587440,590000,ps5 features yeah i'm i'm calling it
GVUyvZfzlXw,590000,592399,first party so if you want a first party
GVUyvZfzlXw,592399,594880,gaming headset uh between the pulse and
GVUyvZfzlXw,594880,596240,these guys
GVUyvZfzlXw,596240,598160,this i think has better audio quality
GVUyvZfzlXw,598160,599920,but the pulse has more features and
GVUyvZfzlXw,599920,601519,they're wireless so
GVUyvZfzlXw,601519,602800,choice is yours
GVUyvZfzlXw,602800,604959,now silly me i've been framing this
GVUyvZfzlXw,604959,608560,whole portion as a ps5 gaming headset
GVUyvZfzlXw,608560,612480,but it's also for gaming pcs uh and it's
GVUyvZfzlXw,612480,614160,honestly the same deal you still get
GVUyvZfzlXw,614160,617279,that same high quality sound uh still
GVUyvZfzlXw,617279,619200,really happy with that what's great with
GVUyvZfzlXw,619200,620399,the pc
GVUyvZfzlXw,620399,622399,is that you can actually go in and
GVUyvZfzlXw,622399,624880,change a lot with the software uh you
GVUyvZfzlXw,624880,626399,can actually control different parts of
GVUyvZfzlXw,626399,629519,the audio it has equalizer settings uh
GVUyvZfzlXw,629519,630480,you can
GVUyvZfzlXw,630480,634079,analyze your ears for that spatial audio
GVUyvZfzlXw,634079,636079,so that you'll have your profile in the
GVUyvZfzlXw,636079,638560,system just way more controls actually
GVUyvZfzlXw,638560,640880,when it comes to the pc side of things i
GVUyvZfzlXw,640880,642640,absolutely feel comfortable recommending
GVUyvZfzlXw,642640,643440,this
GVUyvZfzlXw,643440,646240,for the pc side still feeling like the
GVUyvZfzlXw,646240,651120,h7s are that sweet spot pc or ps5 um but
GVUyvZfzlXw,651120,653920,yeah definitely recommend no matter what
GVUyvZfzlXw,653920,655920,system you're playing on now we got to
GVUyvZfzlXw,655920,659200,talk about the m9 so
GVUyvZfzlXw,659200,661200,the m9 is interesting right now what
GVUyvZfzlXw,661200,663360,we've got here is what i feel like is a
GVUyvZfzlXw,663360,667519,bigger leap for sony into the gaming pc
GVUyvZfzlXw,667519,670560,accessory space uh because we know sony
GVUyvZfzlXw,670560,672240,when it comes to headphones gaming
GVUyvZfzlXw,672240,674480,headsets they have a really extensive
GVUyvZfzlXw,674480,677200,track record but sony's main focus has
GVUyvZfzlXw,677200,680000,usually been on tvs when it comes to
GVUyvZfzlXw,680000,682079,displays and that kind of thing not
GVUyvZfzlXw,682079,684720,really gaming pc monitors and i think
GVUyvZfzlXw,684720,688240,for a first attempt they did a really
GVUyvZfzlXw,688240,690240,really good job here like i said before
GVUyvZfzlXw,690240,694320,this one is the 4k option with 144 hertz
GVUyvZfzlXw,694320,696560,refresh rate there's also a cheaper
GVUyvZfzlXw,696560,699040,option this one is 8.99 there's a
GVUyvZfzlXw,699040,701519,cheaper one that's just full hd
GVUyvZfzlXw,701519,704560,that one goes up to 240 hertz so pick
GVUyvZfzlXw,704560,706640,your weapon do you want that higher
GVUyvZfzlXw,706640,709920,resolution is 144hz enough if you need
GVUyvZfzlXw,709920,712399,that really fast screen you can always
GVUyvZfzlXw,712399,714800,go with the 1080p option uh which is
GVUyvZfzlXw,714800,717680,that 240 but i really like the quality
GVUyvZfzlXw,717680,719440,here and that's
GVUyvZfzlXw,719440,722240,mainly in part because this is a full
GVUyvZfzlXw,722240,724399,array display and that plays a really
GVUyvZfzlXw,724399,725680,big part in the picture quality that
GVUyvZfzlXw,725680,726800,we're getting here because it really
GVUyvZfzlXw,726800,729200,impacts the dynamic range it's a great
GVUyvZfzlXw,729200,731279,monitor i really like this i like the
GVUyvZfzlXw,731279,733760,fact that it has built-in speakers i
GVUyvZfzlXw,733760,735760,like the design and if you want to pair
GVUyvZfzlXw,735760,738160,this with a ps5 like i said it looks the
GVUyvZfzlXw,738160,740480,part and it also has like the software
GVUyvZfzlXw,740480,742240,integration that you would expect as
GVUyvZfzlXw,742240,743839,well so what kind of software
GVUyvZfzlXw,743839,745200,integration do you get with this right
GVUyvZfzlXw,745200,747040,with this depending on what you're doing
GVUyvZfzlXw,747040,749200,on your console let's say you're gaming
GVUyvZfzlXw,749200,751200,it'll automatically switch to the gaming
GVUyvZfzlXw,751200,753680,mode it's a preset mode that sony thinks
GVUyvZfzlXw,753680,756560,is going to give you the best quality uh
GVUyvZfzlXw,756560,758480,for playing games but let's say you want
GVUyvZfzlXw,758480,760160,to watch something like netflix it'll
GVUyvZfzlXw,760160,762639,switch over to the content watching
GVUyvZfzlXw,762639,764800,preset uh so you can watch video and
GVUyvZfzlXw,764800,766880,that kind of thing it's completely
GVUyvZfzlXw,766880,769600,different than the gaming preset mode
GVUyvZfzlXw,769600,771680,and it's hdmi 2.1 so it supports
GVUyvZfzlXw,771680,773519,variable refresh rates
GVUyvZfzlXw,773519,776560,so everything that you want in a monitor
GVUyvZfzlXw,776560,778160,or tv
GVUyvZfzlXw,778160,780560,for your playstation this pretty much
GVUyvZfzlXw,780560,783120,checks all the boxes now one other thing
GVUyvZfzlXw,783120,784800,that i will mention is that when you're
GVUyvZfzlXw,784800,787440,pairing it on the pc you get access to a
GVUyvZfzlXw,787440,789600,ton of controls thanks to the endzone
GVUyvZfzlXw,789600,791120,app so you can make a ton of
GVUyvZfzlXw,791120,792800,configurations it's actually pretty
GVUyvZfzlXw,792800,794240,impressive that that app gives you so
GVUyvZfzlXw,794240,795519,much control when it comes to the
GVUyvZfzlXw,795519,798160,display as well as the gaming headsets
GVUyvZfzlXw,798160,799839,and just to jump into the endzone app
GVUyvZfzlXw,799839,801680,really quick you can do all of your
GVUyvZfzlXw,801680,803279,picture adjustments right from the app
GVUyvZfzlXw,803279,805200,which i feel like is pretty unique as
GVUyvZfzlXw,805200,807200,well as all of the gaming features you
GVUyvZfzlXw,807200,809120,have access to pretty much
GVUyvZfzlXw,809120,811680,everything right here and if you don't
GVUyvZfzlXw,811680,814000,want to use the enzone app you can
GVUyvZfzlXw,814000,817519,always jump into the on-screen menu
GVUyvZfzlXw,817519,818800,you can see you got a bunch of different
GVUyvZfzlXw,818800,820800,options here as well control your
GVUyvZfzlXw,820800,823120,picture settings you can personalize the
GVUyvZfzlXw,823120,825199,lighting from here as well which i like
GVUyvZfzlXw,825199,826880,so everything that you really want to
GVUyvZfzlXw,826880,831680,see you've got all of that here so these
GVUyvZfzlXw,831680,834720,endzone products what what's my opinion
GVUyvZfzlXw,834720,836560,right
GVUyvZfzlXw,836560,838000,i gotta say
GVUyvZfzlXw,838000,840560,i think sony did a really good job this
GVUyvZfzlXw,840560,842079,monitor in particular is pretty
GVUyvZfzlXw,842079,843839,expensive but you can always go to the
GVUyvZfzlXw,843839,846320,1080p option i feel like that's pretty
GVUyvZfzlXw,846320,848079,affordable for what you get in terms of
GVUyvZfzlXw,848079,850160,like overall screen quality and when it
GVUyvZfzlXw,850160,852160,comes to the headsets pricing wise those
GVUyvZfzlXw,852160,854480,are in line uh with a lot of the things
GVUyvZfzlXw,854480,856560,we see with other gaming headsets the
GVUyvZfzlXw,856560,858880,high end ones being around that 300
GVUyvZfzlXw,858880,861279,price point even the 230 one which i
GVUyvZfzlXw,861279,862959,feel like is the sweet spot i think it's
GVUyvZfzlXw,862959,865680,fairly priced and 99 bucks
GVUyvZfzlXw,865680,868000,i feel like this endzone line
GVUyvZfzlXw,868000,869440,i'm looking forward to seeing what they
GVUyvZfzlXw,869440,871760,come out with in the future very happy
GVUyvZfzlXw,871760,873760,with their initial
GVUyvZfzlXw,873760,875839,launch of products i definitely think
GVUyvZfzlXw,875839,877360,these are going to be easy for me to
GVUyvZfzlXw,877360,880160,recommend for uh playstation users as
GVUyvZfzlXw,880160,881440,well as
GVUyvZfzlXw,881440,883920,folks who want a game on a pc sony did a
