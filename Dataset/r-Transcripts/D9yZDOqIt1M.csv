D9yZDOqIt1M,314560,317039,forehead and eyelids at birth
D9yZDOqIt1M,317039,318800,it's believed these scars will protect

D9yZDOqIt1M,320960,323199,gorgeous tattoo right here i'm a big fan

D9yZDOqIt1M,342490,344639,[Applause]
D9yZDOqIt1M,344639,346639,before migrating to tanzania the
D9yZDOqIt1M,346639,348720,datoga's origins are believed to be in
D9yZDOqIt1M,348720,351120,southern sudan or the western ethiopian
D9yZDOqIt1M,351120,355600,highlands going back 3 000 years
D9yZDOqIt1M,362240,364240,timeless tribal traits can still be
D9yZDOqIt1M,364240,367638,witnessed today
D9yZDOqIt1M,367910,371009,[Applause]
D9yZDOqIt1M,374080,375600,i'm curious about the way they dress
D9yZDOqIt1M,375600,377199,themselves up for example everyone has
D9yZDOqIt1M,377199,379520,like these big ear gauges
D9yZDOqIt1M,379520,381600,from what age are they expanding their
D9yZDOqIt1M,381600,383520,ears 15 years so they make the small
D9yZDOqIt1M,383520,385520,hole and they make a bigger bb yeah
D9yZDOqIt1M,385520,387280,because it takes time to stretch out oh

D9yZDOqIt1M,409759,412319,oh yeah give me some time i think i can
D9yZDOqIt1M,412319,414160,get there
D9yZDOqIt1M,414160,415919,yeah so she said no problem you just
D9yZDOqIt1M,415919,418560,take the knife
D9yZDOqIt1M,418880,422599,i'll consider it
D9yZDOqIt1M,424479,426240,women are tasked with taking care of
D9yZDOqIt1M,426240,428560,children cooking everyday meals making
D9yZDOqIt1M,428560,430240,clothes and jewelry so this is some of
D9yZDOqIt1M,430240,431759,the leather that they've made here oh
D9yZDOqIt1M,431759,434319,wow it is heavy i mean this is like four
D9yZDOqIt1M,434319,436160,or five pounds you will not find that at
D9yZDOqIt1M,436160,438479,h m maybe forever 21.
D9yZDOqIt1M,438479,439919,as for the men
D9yZDOqIt1M,439919,442160,not right now but sometimes they have
D9yZDOqIt1M,442160,444800,important tasks too
D9yZDOqIt1M,444800,446560,like protecting the village from enemies
D9yZDOqIt1M,446560,449120,or building houses
D9yZDOqIt1M,449120,451120,daily life centers around tending to the
D9yZDOqIt1M,451120,453440,cattle this is also man's work walking
D9yZDOqIt1M,453440,455360,with the cattle for miles in search of
D9yZDOqIt1M,455360,457120,grazing lands
D9yZDOqIt1M,457120,459199,on the occasions when they do sacrifice
D9yZDOqIt1M,459199,461520,an animal for consumption the men are
D9yZDOqIt1M,461520,464440,also tasked with dispatching
D9yZDOqIt1M,464440,466879,[Music]
D9yZDOqIt1M,466879,469360,why do they put milk in its mouth
D9yZDOqIt1M,469360,470800,they put the milk in the mouth to wish
D9yZDOqIt1M,470800,474440,to have a lot of cows
D9yZDOqIt1M,477150,482000,[Music]
D9yZDOqIt1M,482000,484080,it is essential that the animal's blood
D9yZDOqIt1M,484080,486560,be kept inside
D9yZDOqIt1M,486560,488240,so rather than bleeding it out and
D9yZDOqIt1M,488240,490720,wasting precious calories they instead
D9yZDOqIt1M,490720,492879,opt to suffocate the creature using
D9yZDOqIt1M,492879,494800,sticks and applying pressure to its
D9yZDOqIt1M,494800,496560,throat
D9yZDOqIt1M,496560,498960,the chef prays until the animal draws
D9yZDOqIt1M,498960,501840,its final breath
D9yZDOqIt1M,502160,504240,in most tribes i visited the work of
D9yZDOqIt1M,504240,506720,slicing dicing and butchering is left up
D9yZDOqIt1M,506720,508800,to the men but not in the case of the da
D9yZDOqIt1M,508800,511198,toga
D9yZDOqIt1M,514880,516959,there is no doubt that this is a messy
D9yZDOqIt1M,516959,519120,laborious task but that doesn't mean
D9yZDOqIt1M,519120,520479,it's without its purse so here
D9yZDOqIt1M,520479,522159,traditionally the women are the ones
D9yZDOqIt1M,522159,524240,handling all the butchering skinning
D9yZDOqIt1M,524240,526000,retrieving the blood
D9yZDOqIt1M,526000,527920,what that means also is that the women
D9yZDOqIt1M,527920,531680,get first dibs on this blood
D9yZDOqIt1M,533519,535279,looks tasty now we all know that i've
D9yZDOqIt1M,535279,536640,tried blood already i tried it with the
D9yZDOqIt1M,536640,540640,maasai people and it was outstanding
D9yZDOqIt1M,541440,543279,yeah yeah you eat that right so i don't
D9yZDOqIt1M,543279,545040,need to do that again but this is really
D9yZDOqIt1M,545040,546800,the first time for me that i've seen the
D9yZDOqIt1M,546800,548560,women drinking raw blood i've seen it
D9yZDOqIt1M,548560,550320,many places with the men especially with
D9yZDOqIt1M,550320,552080,the messiah men but here the women
D9yZDOqIt1M,552080,555760,they've got the blood all to themselves
D9yZDOqIt1M,556000,556800,oh
D9yZDOqIt1M,556800,560160,i'm so full i just had lunch
D9yZDOqIt1M,566160,568000,at first i just saw the blood and i
D9yZDOqIt1M,568000,569760,thought well i just had blood yesterday
D9yZDOqIt1M,569760,571120,i don't need to try it again i know what
D9yZDOqIt1M,571120,572640,blood is like here they're doing
D9yZDOqIt1M,572640,574080,something new something i've never seen
D9yZDOqIt1M,574080,576640,before so they have all the organs raw
D9yZDOqIt1M,576640,579120,raw liver raw heart and this is the bile
D9yZDOqIt1M,579120,581200,from the animal can i see that oh god
D9yZDOqIt1M,581200,581930,why am i doing this
D9yZDOqIt1M,581930,584640,[Music]
D9yZDOqIt1M,584640,586480,this revolting green liquid is a
D9yZDOqIt1M,586480,588959,combination of gastric acid and bile
D9yZDOqIt1M,588959,590959,squeezed out from the small intestine of
D9yZDOqIt1M,590959,593120,the animal this is going to be mixed oh
D9yZDOqIt1M,593120,594800,actually she's mixed it already here she

D9yZDOqIt1M,769120,771519,meat is chopped into various cuts larger
D9yZDOqIt1M,771519,773519,portions are stored and smoked inside
D9yZDOqIt1M,773519,775920,the house for future use
D9yZDOqIt1M,775920,777440,when it comes to cooking the remaining
D9yZDOqIt1M,777440,780160,meat it's done two ways the men's way
D9yZDOqIt1M,780160,782399,and the women's way lucky for me i get
D9yZDOqIt1M,782399,785880,to try both
D9yZDOqIt1M,786800,789040,these savannah warriors grill the meat
D9yZDOqIt1M,789040,791519,positioning specific cuts on wood frames
D9yZDOqIt1M,791519,793839,and staking them close to the fire
D9yZDOqIt1M,793839,796480,season with a little bit of salt
D9yZDOqIt1M,796480,798720,all the meat is roasting right now you
D9yZDOqIt1M,798720,800399,can see it's cooked much the same way as
D9yZDOqIt1M,800399,802240,the messiah was cooking their goat okay
D9yZDOqIt1M,802240,804000,that one's done for sure the only big
D9yZDOqIt1M,804000,805760,difference here is uh that this is all
D9yZDOqIt1M,805760,807839,beef but it's very quick very efficient
D9yZDOqIt1M,807839,809279,they put it all around the fire and then
D9yZDOqIt1M,809279,811200,it roasts until they think it's done
D9yZDOqIt1M,811200,812639,over here is the eating area i'm gonna
D9yZDOqIt1M,812639,814480,head there now
D9yZDOqIt1M,814480,816560,the eating style here very similar one
D9yZDOqIt1M,816560,818399,person has the meat they are the pit
D9yZDOqIt1M,818399,820480,master they slice it off piece by piece
D9yZDOqIt1M,820480,822079,and they hand it out i love it it's very
D9yZDOqIt1M,822079,824880,communal style
D9yZDOqIt1M,826320,829199,yeah exactly
D9yZDOqIt1M,829600,831040,i don't know what piece i'm eating but
D9yZDOqIt1M,831040,832959,this requires some really strong teeth
D9yZDOqIt1M,832959,834880,the taste is good they put salt on it
D9yZDOqIt1M,834880,836480,whoa we've got a new piece right here
D9yZDOqIt1M,836480,838240,this looks like a beef rib to me they've
D9yZDOqIt1M,838240,840000,cracked it a few times let's see if this
D9yZDOqIt1M,840000,842399,is any more tender
D9yZDOqIt1M,842399,845680,okay yummy baby fairly juicy incredibly
D9yZDOqIt1M,845680,847120,tough here's the thing people here don't

D9yZDOqIt1M,848639,850160,every place is like where i come from
D9yZDOqIt1M,850160,851680,there's a lot of cultures out there that

D9yZDOqIt1M,971040,973120,sharing runs deep in every tribe i

D9yZDOqIt1M,978160,980079,why the difference it's the way they eat
D9yZDOqIt1M,980079,982399,the men prefer to make a barbecue but
D9yZDOqIt1M,982399,984000,for the woman they like to put some
D9yZDOqIt1M,984000,987360,small portion and they give to it
D9yZDOqIt1M,987360,988639,so we have a couple different things
D9yZDOqIt1M,988639,990639,here on the menu we have the ugali

D9yZDOqIt1M,1019040,1020639,awesome it's like butter that tastes

D9yZDOqIt1M,1022720,1024798,that's so delicious it is like the ranch
D9yZDOqIt1M,1024798,1026480,sauce of this village
D9yZDOqIt1M,1026480,1028000,you can dip anything in there that's
D9yZDOqIt1M,1028000,1029438,really nice
D9yZDOqIt1M,1029438,1031678,here i've got a piece of boiled beef
D9yZDOqIt1M,1031678,1034240,yeah she's eating it right off the rim
D9yZDOqIt1M,1034240,1036319,oh gosh it is still quite tough let me
D9yZDOqIt1M,1036319,1038959,try it out
D9yZDOqIt1M,1038959,1041678,wow it's real chewy do people here like
D9yZDOqIt1M,1041678,1043600,the chewy meat yeah because it's tasty
D9yZDOqIt1M,1043600,1045038,so when they cook rinse off they're
D9yZDOqIt1M,1045038,1047120,gonna feel the taste really yeah so they
D9yZDOqIt1M,1047120,1049440,want to chew it and suck the liquid feel
D9yZDOqIt1M,1049440,1051039,the taste that's what i thought that
D9yZDOqIt1M,1051039,1052880,might be the case it's like the flavor
D9yZDOqIt1M,1052880,1054960,release crystal it's an extra gum the
D9yZDOqIt1M,1054960,1056640,taste is good it just happens to be very
D9yZDOqIt1M,1056640,1059280,very chewy oh hello oh
D9yZDOqIt1M,1059280,1062080,oh that's mine no that's mine i touched
D9yZDOqIt1M,1062080,1065399,it whoa
D9yZDOqIt1M,1066000,1068020,all right
D9yZDOqIt1M,1068020,1070799,[Music]
D9yZDOqIt1M,1070799,1072880,oh wow jesus christ who cleaned these
D9yZDOqIt1M,1072880,1073919,out
D9yZDOqIt1M,1073919,1075679,the intestines taste somewhat clean it's
D9yZDOqIt1M,1075679,1077360,like i could handle it but i just had
D9yZDOqIt1M,1077360,1079760,ptsd from eating that raw gastric acid
D9yZDOqIt1M,1079760,1080960,and that's what it tastes like inside
D9yZDOqIt1M,1080960,1082320,here maybe i'm doing it wrong because
D9yZDOqIt1M,1082320,1084080,yes the intestines are quite intense but
D9yZDOqIt1M,1084080,1085679,everyone here they take the ugali and
D9yZDOqIt1M,1085679,1087280,they kind of cut the taste with that
D9yZDOqIt1M,1087280,1089360,here she just handed me the broth now
D9yZDOqIt1M,1089360,1091600,this broth is from basically the boiled
D9yZDOqIt1M,1091600,1095039,innards boiled beef all that together
D9yZDOqIt1M,1095039,1098240,oh that's actually quite nice
D9yZDOqIt1M,1099600,1101600,that's really good really salty tons of
D9yZDOqIt1M,1101600,1103200,animal fats it's just like a deep
D9yZDOqIt1M,1103200,1105520,delicious beef broth the broth with the
D9yZDOqIt1M,1105520,1108000,ugali combination that is pretty awesome
D9yZDOqIt1M,1108000,1109360,it's quite delicious probably my
D9yZDOqIt1M,1109360,1111280,favorite thing so far today
D9yZDOqIt1M,1111280,1113120,this place the differentiation and work
D9yZDOqIt1M,1113120,1114799,between men and women it's fascinating
D9yZDOqIt1M,1114799,1116720,to me because in most tribes i go to the
D9yZDOqIt1M,1116720,1118640,men would slaughter the cow they would
D9yZDOqIt1M,1118640,1120480,skin it they would butcher it but after
D9yZDOqIt1M,1120480,1122559,the slaughter here the women jump in
D9yZDOqIt1M,1122559,1124880,right away and the women seem to do a
D9yZDOqIt1M,1124880,1128919,lot of work here for example
D9yZDOqIt1M,1138559,1140559,you know a long time ago men had
D9yZDOqIt1M,1140559,1142240,different traditional roles a hundred
D9yZDOqIt1M,1142240,1144880,years ago men were hunting animals men
D9yZDOqIt1M,1144880,1147280,were protecting the village from lions
D9yZDOqIt1M,1147280,1149840,do they still do that they still the man
D9yZDOqIt1M,1149840,1151679,protesting the village you can see the
D9yZDOqIt1M,1151679,1154320,animals face there so the men they just
D9yZDOqIt1M,1154320,1157200,sleep near to the fair really the men
D9yZDOqIt1M,1157200,1159120,sleep outside yeah they sleep outside to
D9yZDOqIt1M,1159120,1160640,take care of the end what about when it
D9yZDOqIt1M,1160640,1162080,rains
D9yZDOqIt1M,1162080,1164240,they have their cow skin is very strong
D9yZDOqIt1M,1164240,1168240,to protect them yeah oh my gosh
D9yZDOqIt1M,1170799,1172320,me it looks like you guys have
D9yZDOqIt1M,1172320,1174480,everything here all the basic needs are
D9yZDOqIt1M,1174480,1177120,met but what's missing
D9yZDOqIt1M,1177120,1180320,uh for us now just only by call but if
D9yZDOqIt1M,1180320,1182880,we need it we take the cow we send to
D9yZDOqIt1M,1182880,1185440,the local market we sell it then we buy
D9yZDOqIt1M,1185440,1188160,corn so there's nothing missing no
D9yZDOqIt1M,1188160,1190080,that's beautiful
D9yZDOqIt1M,1190080,1192000,sometimes people watching this show
D9yZDOqIt1M,1192000,1194080,mistake my casual way of interacting
D9yZDOqIt1M,1194080,1196559,with locals for a lack of irreverence or
D9yZDOqIt1M,1196559,1199039,outright disrespect
D9yZDOqIt1M,1199039,1201360,she knows the ministries reality can i
D9yZDOqIt1M,1201360,1202880,put my finger in there i'm never forced
