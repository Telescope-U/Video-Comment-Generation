vzyo5siH224,124290,127550,Why? Because I don't live in the back rooms.

vzyo5siH224,178930,180400,We're gonna post a picture of us
vzyo5siH224,180400,182956,holding a hacky sack on Instagram.
vzyo5siH224,182956,183788,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,183789,187110,"- And y'all gotta comment, ""It's a sack. I'm a hack."""
vzyo5siH224,187110,187960,- I like it.
vzyo5siH224,187960,190030,(upbeat rock music)
vzyo5siH224,190030,192481,"- All right, let's do some hot cottage cheese-"
vzyo5siH224,192481,193314,- Yum!
vzyo5siH224,193314,196532,- With hot berries versus cold mashed potatoes
vzyo5siH224,196533,198510,with cold gravy.
vzyo5siH224,198510,200750,- This doesn't immediately gross me out.
vzyo5siH224,200750,201583,"- Yeah, I mean it-"
vzyo5siH224,201583,203659,- It's just hot cheese soup.
vzyo5siH224,203660,204663,You mind if I stir?
vzyo5siH224,206830,207663,- Sure. Go for it.
vzyo5siH224,207663,210799,"I kind of want, what is this? A dried cherry?"
vzyo5siH224,210800,212180,- [Nicole] That's a blueberry.
vzyo5siH224,212180,213012,- [Rhett] It's a dried blueberry.
vzyo5siH224,213013,214070,"- Oh, it's just everything."
vzyo5siH224,214070,216250,All the fruit is shriveled because-
vzyo5siH224,216250,217083,- It's hot.
vzyo5siH224,217083,218540,- It's because it's been hot-ified.
vzyo5siH224,218540,221592,"- This is sort of like, it looks like a good oatmeal."
vzyo5siH224,222750,227000,"- I mean, I really like cold cottage cheese."
vzyo5siH224,227000,228923,"It's my favorite cheese, I think."
vzyo5siH224,232640,236170,"Oh, that is unlike anything I expected."
vzyo5siH224,236170,237959,- That is wonderful.
vzyo5siH224,237960,238960,- It's sour.
vzyo5siH224,238960,240530,- That is wonderful!
vzyo5siH224,240530,241572,- I don't know that this is wonderful.
vzyo5siH224,241572,243623,- [Nicole] Really? - Hold on.
vzyo5siH224,243623,246010,"- As somebody whose favorite cheese is cottage cheese,"
vzyo5siH224,246010,247312,how could you not like this?
vzyo5siH224,247313,248390,It's just cottage cheese.
vzyo5siH224,248390,250340,It didn't take didn't change the taste of it.
vzyo5siH224,250340,253680,"- It changed the temperature and the consistently,"
vzyo5siH224,253680,254512,consistency- - So consistently.
vzyo5siH224,254513,258070,- So drastically. I can't make any words.
vzyo5siH224,258070,261329,"- It made a soup! Consis-timancy, drast-mically."
vzyo5siH224,261329,263300,- I would have to be told that this was not intended
vzyo5siH224,263300,265580,to just be exactly as it is.
vzyo5siH224,265580,267150,- [Link] Well...
vzyo5siH224,267150,268378,- [Rhett] It's cheese soup! I love it.
vzyo5siH224,268378,273378,"- I love the like, soft yet curdy-"
vzyo5siH224,273660,274493,- Yeah!
vzyo5siH224,274493,277400,- Part of cottage cheese and that's gone.
vzyo5siH224,277400,279310,- It's gone? It's just even softer now.
vzyo5siH224,279310,280650,- [Link] It isn't bad.
vzyo5siH224,280650,282120,- [Rhett] I would go as to say it's-
vzyo5siH224,282120,283490,- You're trying to make it an improvement
vzyo5siH224,283490,285250,over cottage cheese and that hurts my feelings.
vzyo5siH224,285250,286810,- It might be better than cold cottage cheese
vzyo5siH224,286810,287910,with berries in it.
vzyo5siH224,287910,289373,- That hurts my feelings.
vzyo5siH224,290490,291323,"- Now this, on the other hand."
vzyo5siH224,291323,292669,- This can't.
vzyo5siH224,292670,294590,- [Rhett] Cold gravy?
vzyo5siH224,294590,296210,- [Link] I bet this is what they voted for
vzyo5siH224,296210,298110,because this is what I would vote for.
vzyo5siH224,299040,300700,- The thing that we're gonna like more?
vzyo5siH224,300700,301830,"- Oh, is it like more?"
vzyo5siH224,301830,303900,"No, then I bet they didn't vote for."
vzyo5siH224,303900,305860,- And we don't try to guess what they said.
vzyo5siH224,305860,308120,We just say which one we prefer.
vzyo5siH224,308120,308953,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,308953,311300,- And then they're either right or wrong.
vzyo5siH224,311300,312479,I didn't wanna take a bite of this.
vzyo5siH224,312480,315010,- You know what? I don't think this is bad.
vzyo5siH224,315010,318170,It's still got all the taste that you would need to taste.
vzyo5siH224,318170,320740,- Cold gravy's not nearly as bad as it thought it would be.
vzyo5siH224,320740,322150,- [Link] That's some good cold gravy.
vzyo5siH224,322150,323290,"- [Nicole] Yeah, homemade."
vzyo5siH224,323290,325000,"- Could be done wrong, but you did it right."
vzyo5siH224,325000,326510,- But I don't immediately want more of it.
vzyo5siH224,326510,328920,"This, I wanna keep going back to."
vzyo5siH224,328920,330900,- I will tell you- - It's not bad.
vzyo5siH224,330900,333949,- This does seem like an entirely new dish.
vzyo5siH224,333950,338260,"And once you know what to expect, it's not bad at all."
vzyo5siH224,338260,339093,- Hot cheese soup.
vzyo5siH224,339093,340180,"- And I know you're already voting for it,"
vzyo5siH224,340180,344050,"so I'm gonna agree with you because this is just tolerable,"
vzyo5siH224,344050,347740,but I keep thinking it's backwards.
vzyo5siH224,347740,348573,- We like this one more.
vzyo5siH224,348573,352300,- Did you predict we would?
vzyo5siH224,352300,355370,- [Stevie] 61% of the Mythical Beasts thought
vzyo5siH224,355370,360290,that you'd like the cold mashed potatoes and gravy better.
vzyo5siH224,360290,361123,- Really?
vzyo5siH224,361123,362378,- I wonder why they thought that.
vzyo5siH224,362378,363770,It was probably because-
vzyo5siH224,363770,365616,- [Stevie] The phrase hot cottage cheese
vzyo5siH224,365616,368030,needs some branding help.
vzyo5siH224,368030,368863,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,368863,370609,- I kinda like a hot cottage.
vzyo5siH224,370609,371733,(crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,371733,372804,You know? Like a warm-
vzyo5siH224,372804,374650,"- Cottage on fire? - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
vzyo5siH224,374650,376120,- Go all the way. - Yeah. Right.
vzyo5siH224,376120,377660,- So my cottage is burning.
vzyo5siH224,377660,379630,- I don't know. I think y'all are wrong.
vzyo5siH224,379630,380549,"Well, you definitely are wrong."
vzyo5siH224,380549,382810,(upbeat rock music)
vzyo5siH224,382810,385960,Hope you're hungry because we've got hot Caesar salad
vzyo5siH224,385960,388130,versus chilly chili dog.
vzyo5siH224,388130,390573,"- I mean, this is disturbing to look at"
vzyo5siH224,390573,394652,"because I mean, how did you make this hot?"
vzyo5siH224,394652,396320,- [Nicole] I stir fried it.
vzyo5siH224,396320,398270,"- You just, and you seem so proud."
vzyo5siH224,398270,399220,- [Nicole] Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,399220,400053,"- Now, hold on. - It's brown."
vzyo5siH224,400053,402600,"- The fact that you stir fried it makes me think,"
vzyo5siH224,402600,405403,think about just like sauteed cabbage or sauteed spinach.
vzyo5siH224,405403,406797,- Okay. Yeah. - You know?
vzyo5siH224,406797,408536,"- [Nicole] You're such a positive man, Rhett."
vzyo5siH224,408536,409980,"- (laughing) Yeah, I know."
vzyo5siH224,409980,414080,"- It is about that expectation, the marketing."
vzyo5siH224,414080,417129,"I got this crouton. Croutons should still be crunchy, right?"
vzyo5siH224,417130,419210,- And think about a spinach and artichoke dip.
vzyo5siH224,419210,420530,That's hot.
vzyo5siH224,420530,423453,"- Yeah, but it doesn't have wilted lettuce."
vzyo5siH224,425140,429420,"Hey, if I go into a wilted spinach territory."
vzyo5siH224,429420,434420,- Lettuce doesn't hold up as well as spinach in the pan.
vzyo5siH224,434510,435343,- [Link] No.
vzyo5siH224,435343,438250,- But if you'd have just taken it and just made it hot
vzyo5siH224,438250,441050,"with like a microwave, it would be utterly nasty"
vzyo5siH224,441050,443112,and this is just not my fave.
vzyo5siH224,443113,444560,"- Yeah, the taste is still intact."
vzyo5siH224,444560,445723,- Just not my fave.
vzyo5siH224,447450,450720,- So we've got the play on words
vzyo5siH224,450720,452690,with the chilly chili dog here.
vzyo5siH224,452690,453690,Isn't that cute?
vzyo5siH224,453690,455450,"- It's very cold. Like, the bun is cold."
vzyo5siH224,455450,457020,It's not just room temperature.
vzyo5siH224,457020,458440,- Yeah because I try to get to a point
vzyo5siH224,458440,460060,"where it's like, if you leave the hot dog out"
vzyo5siH224,460060,463360,for a long time and you live in a cold climate.
vzyo5siH224,463360,464193,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,464193,465810,"- Then this is just, this is their room temperature."
vzyo5siH224,465810,469880,- Right. I'm gonna just push the dog a little bit forward.
vzyo5siH224,469880,470713,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,470713,473770,- So the dog and I'm gonna push some toppings
vzyo5siH224,473770,474840,a little bit to the side.
vzyo5siH224,474840,476250,- Doing the same thing here.
vzyo5siH224,476250,478363,- Yeah. Just to make the perfect bite there.
vzyo5siH224,480770,484013,- It definitely has a cold climate left over feel.
vzyo5siH224,485660,487020,"Oh, boy."
vzyo5siH224,487020,490129,I shouldn't have visited Michigan this time of year.
vzyo5siH224,490130,491580,"Right, boy?"
vzyo5siH224,491580,493330,- Upper peninsula.
vzyo5siH224,493330,495270,- Not bad. Not bad.
vzyo5siH224,495270,500163,"- As a kid, I would go into, because my neighbor, Peter,"
vzyo5siH224,502153,505160,he told me about raw hot dogs.
vzyo5siH224,505160,505993,- Okay.
vzyo5siH224,505993,507890,- Which is just going into the fridge
vzyo5siH224,507890,509920,and grabbing a hot dog uncooked and just eating it.
vzyo5siH224,509920,511260,"I mean, but it is precooked."
vzyo5siH224,511260,512890,"It's not really raw, but as kids, we didn't know."
vzyo5siH224,512890,514862,"- See, he was doing reverse marketing on you."
vzyo5siH224,514862,516529,"It's like, oh, this is unsafe. This is scary."
vzyo5siH224,516530,518431,"- But he was like, ""You gotta try it."""
vzyo5siH224,518431,521580,"And so it was like one time when my mom wasn't looking,"
vzyo5siH224,521580,523130,I ate a cold wiener.
vzyo5siH224,523130,523990,- Yeah?
vzyo5siH224,523990,528120,"- And I never looked back, honestly."
vzyo5siH224,528120,529010,- That's your preference?
vzyo5siH224,529010,532570,- No. I eventually became a man.
vzyo5siH224,532570,535250,"- Well, I mean, when you say never look back,"
vzyo5siH224,535250,537685,that kind of implies that you never eat them warm again.
vzyo5siH224,537685,540570,"- I'm saying like, in my childhood, I never looked back."
vzyo5siH224,540570,542130,"I still enjoyed hot hot dogs,"
vzyo5siH224,542130,544080,"but I would sneak a cold wiener,"
vzyo5siH224,544080,545660,if you weren't watching me too close.
vzyo5siH224,545660,546959,- Sounds like you looked back.
vzyo5siH224,546960,547793,- I was ashamed. I was ashamed.
vzyo5siH224,547793,550045,- But you would look back from looking back.
vzyo5siH224,550045,550878,(crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,550878,551711,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess."
vzyo5siH224,551711,553510,- So you never look back.
vzyo5siH224,554960,557149,You looked forward and then kept looking back occasionally.
vzyo5siH224,557149,559373,"- But even as a cold wiener liker,"
vzyo5siH224,560690,561850,I want you to do the voting here
vzyo5siH224,561850,563738,because I think both of these are actually standing-
vzyo5siH224,563738,566071,- This is nasty.
vzyo5siH224,566071,567444,- [Rhett] I think it's okay.
vzyo5siH224,567444,569949,- This is just a cold wiener in the breeze.
vzyo5siH224,569950,570810,- Yeah. (crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,570810,572830,- The Michigan breeze. - Right.
vzyo5siH224,572830,574710,- 68% of the Mythical Beasts thought
vzyo5siH224,574710,577090,that you'd like the cold chili dog better.
vzyo5siH224,577090,580790,"- Yeah, you had to know that just because of the..."
vzyo5siH224,580790,581920,- Just because of that.
vzyo5siH224,581920,584477,- The floppy greenery. (retching)
vzyo5siH224,584478,586850,(upbeat rock music)
vzyo5siH224,586850,588420,"And next, vying for the opportunity"
vzyo5siH224,588420,590370,"to be licked by a golden tongue,"
vzyo5siH224,590370,594320,we've got hot root beer in float form
vzyo5siH224,594320,596423,versus cold instant ramen.
vzyo5siH224,597980,598813,"What you think, man?"
vzyo5siH224,598813,600433,- I feel like you might have to sit this one out
vzyo5siH224,600433,601620,because you don't like root beer.
vzyo5siH224,601620,602529,"I mean, you know?"
vzyo5siH224,602530,604060,"- I'm looking for a discovery, though."
vzyo5siH224,604060,605720,I think the hot cottage-
vzyo5siH224,605720,606553,- I think this is gonna be good.
vzyo5siH224,606553,609009,"- Was a discovery, but other than that,"
vzyo5siH224,609010,609890,I haven't been too intrigued.
vzyo5siH224,609890,612230,- Because I love a root beer flavor.
vzyo5siH224,612230,613962,I don't mind hot milk.
vzyo5siH224,614980,617279,- Maybe this will turn me on to the root beer.
vzyo5siH224,618430,619263,- This is exact.
vzyo5siH224,619263,621090,"This could be like, a holiday drink."
vzyo5siH224,621090,622410,You know what I'm saying?
vzyo5siH224,622410,623829,You could go to a wassail.
vzyo5siH224,623830,626040,- I think it's better than root beer.
vzyo5siH224,626040,627399,- Oh.
vzyo5siH224,627400,628233,- It's creamy.
vzyo5siH224,628233,631430,"You've added added the ice cream, of course."
vzyo5siH224,631430,632720,- [Nicole] Yeah. Melted ice cream.
vzyo5siH224,632720,634832,- Which makes it float and that makes it taste better.
vzyo5siH224,634832,635858,"- Which is like a really, really thick milk."
vzyo5siH224,635858,637657,"- You know, if you added a whole lot of ice cream-"
vzyo5siH224,637658,638491,- It's so good!
vzyo5siH224,638491,640810,"- And almost no root beer, I think I'd really love"
vzyo5siH224,640810,642373,"a root beer float, even hot."
vzyo5siH224,643750,646580,- But it kind of just tastes like a new latte
vzyo5siH224,646580,648150,at Starbucks that's like-
vzyo5siH224,648150,649960,"- [Link] Yeah, just as sweet as something-"
vzyo5siH224,649960,651800,- [Rhett] Root beer flavored.
vzyo5siH224,651800,652633,- What would we call that?
vzyo5siH224,652633,653710,Because you give it a name
vzyo5siH224,653710,655240,and this thing's definitely gonna win.
vzyo5siH224,655240,656636,So we're gonna put this here for now.
vzyo5siH224,656637,658840,"- Oh, this is the new technique?"
vzyo5siH224,658840,660730,"- I mean, that that's how strongly we feel about it."
vzyo5siH224,660730,661910,- Preliminarily?
vzyo5siH224,661910,663720,The fact that you're into it makes me think yeah.
vzyo5siH224,663720,665232,Cold ramen.
vzyo5siH224,665232,667430,- Sorry chopsticks.
vzyo5siH224,667430,670380,"- Cold ramen ain't never hurt nobody, right?"
vzyo5siH224,670380,671570,Right?
vzyo5siH224,671570,672923,- Right. - Right?
vzyo5siH224,674410,676368,(Rhett laughing)
vzyo5siH224,676368,677649,- Got it on my forehead.
vzyo5siH224,677650,679963,- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
vzyo5siH224,684440,685840,- Nothing heinous happening.
vzyo5siH224,687990,691000,Part of that ramen experience is the hotness.
vzyo5siH224,691000,692734,- It's definitely not as good as hot ramen.
vzyo5siH224,692734,693567,- [Link] No.
vzyo5siH224,693567,694850,- But it's not bad.
vzyo5siH224,694850,698889,- Yeah. It's just not anything new
vzyo5siH224,698890,701100,and when something new happens-
vzyo5siH224,701100,702006,- I'm glad you put the golden tongue on it already.
vzyo5siH224,702007,705030,"- You cannot deny it. See, it's conveniently there."
vzyo5siH224,705030,706960,"You knew this, right?"
vzyo5siH224,706960,708780,- [Stevie] 61% of the Mythical Beasts thought
vzyo5siH224,708780,712470,that you would like the cold ramen better.
vzyo5siH224,712470,713547,- You're stupid!
vzyo5siH224,713547,715322,(Rhett and crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,715322,716390,"- Hey, come on. Hey, hey, hey."
vzyo5siH224,716390,717569,"Hey, come on now."
vzyo5siH224,717569,719024,(upbeat rock music)
vzyo5siH224,719025,721320,"All right, now we've got hot oysters."
vzyo5siH224,721320,722330,- [Link] That makes sense to me.
vzyo5siH224,722330,724263,- And cold eggs Benedicts.
vzyo5siH224,726210,729331,"Now, oysters Rockefeller-"
vzyo5siH224,729331,730440,- I'm gonna predict that.
vzyo5siH224,730440,732482,"- Is already a hot oyster. Right, Stevie?"
vzyo5siH224,732482,734246,You're an oyster lover.
vzyo5siH224,734246,737420,"- [Stevie] Well, I mean, Nicole would have to speak"
vzyo5siH224,737421,739120,to how these were prepared.
vzyo5siH224,739120,741230,I'm thinking a little bit differently.
vzyo5siH224,741230,742949,"- [Nicole] Yeah, So I pretty much just put it"
vzyo5siH224,742950,744770,"under the broiler for like, three minutes,"
vzyo5siH224,744770,747310,just to get it warmed and it is safe for you to consume.
vzyo5siH224,747310,749190,I've temp checked everything
vzyo5siH224,749190,752390,so you can swallow it without any problems.
vzyo5siH224,752390,753522,Not get sick.
vzyo5siH224,753522,754569,"- Not really, though."
vzyo5siH224,754570,757170,- [Nicole] You have my word on that part.
vzyo5siH224,757170,758560,- Why are you saying that so suspiciously?
vzyo5siH224,758560,759580,- [Nicole] I don't know. (crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,759580,761250,- I wasn't even thinking it wasn't gonna be safe.
vzyo5siH224,761250,762850,"- [Nicole] I mean, I just did. I don't know."
vzyo5siH224,762850,764050,I just don't want you to feel bad.
vzyo5siH224,764050,768540,- But is not an oysters Rockefeller a hot oyster?
vzyo5siH224,768540,770471,"- [Nicole] Yeah, but it has stuff on it."
vzyo5siH224,770471,771610,- It's got a bunch of stuff on it.
vzyo5siH224,771610,773579,"- [Nicole] And it's fully like, it's no trace"
vzyo5siH224,773580,775177,of like rawness or anything.
vzyo5siH224,775177,778720,"But this one, you know, it's like, warmed."
vzyo5siH224,778720,781009,- So basically it's raw but hot.
vzyo5siH224,781010,781864,- [Nicole] Yes. - It's hot raw.
vzyo5siH224,781864,782697,- [Nicole] And safe to consume.
vzyo5siH224,782697,784988,"It's hot, raw, and safe to consume."
vzyo5siH224,784988,785821,(crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,785821,788094,- And hot raw. Is hot raw cooked?
vzyo5siH224,788094,789120,Not necessarily. - Not necessarily.
vzyo5siH224,789120,790860,"- Just because something gets hot, doesn't get cooked."
vzyo5siH224,790860,791940,- What is this in the middle?
vzyo5siH224,791940,793070,- [Nicole] It's a mignonette.
vzyo5siH224,793070,794910,It's a hot mignonette.
vzyo5siH224,794910,798120,It's vinegar and shallots. It's good.
vzyo5siH224,798120,800130,"- I thought that was like, a little puppet show."
vzyo5siH224,800130,802229,"- [Nicole] No, that's a marionette, silly."
vzyo5siH224,802229,803547,- Oh. (crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,803547,805679,- And why is it on charcoal?
vzyo5siH224,805679,806512,- Theme. - Theme?
vzyo5siH224,806512,808750,"- [Nicole] Because instead of, yeah. It's like a theme."
vzyo5siH224,808750,810202,- Yeah. - Okay.
vzyo5siH224,810202,811632,(crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,811632,812465,It's like Disneyland.
vzyo5siH224,812465,813298,- I'm afraid to do what you're doing.
vzyo5siH224,813298,815699,"Oh, you're gonna eat right outta the shell, I thought."
vzyo5siH224,815700,817870,I don't wanna cut my lips.
vzyo5siH224,817870,819620,"- Well, I don't wanna cut my lips."
vzyo5siH224,819620,821170,"- Oh, gosh. It smells horrible."
vzyo5siH224,822390,823293,Hot raw.
vzyo5siH224,825030,826480,"Yeah, it's raw, but it's hot."
vzyo5siH224,827420,830061,"Yeah. Wow, now, I understand."
vzyo5siH224,830061,831453,- (coughing) Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,831453,832420,- This is not a Rockfellers. - Now I understand.
vzyo5siH224,832420,834160,- The Rockefellers would not stand for this.
vzyo5siH224,834160,837209,(crew laughing)
vzyo5siH224,837210,838233,- Hot and raw.
vzyo5siH224,840350,842233,"I eat so few of these that I'm just like,"
vzyo5siH224,842233,845769,"yeah, this is my oyster experience."
vzyo5siH224,845770,846603,Period.
vzyo5siH224,846603,847890,"- You're saying when you eat a cold one,"
vzyo5siH224,847890,849300,this is how it feels to you?
vzyo5siH224,849300,850133,- Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,850133,852279,"- I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry."
vzyo5siH224,852280,856080,- I actually get this more than normal.
vzyo5siH224,856080,857340,I just still don't like it.
vzyo5siH224,857340,858455,- The cold feels refreshing.
vzyo5siH224,858455,861380,It feels like I reached into the ocean like a mermaid
vzyo5siH224,861380,862213,and pull it right out.
vzyo5siH224,862213,864060,- Exactly. That's gross.
vzyo5siH224,864060,867760,"- Okay, so I'm assuming that this is gonna still"
vzyo5siH224,867760,868987,be like a poached egg?
vzyo5siH224,868987,869830,But cold.
vzyo5siH224,869830,871991,- [Nicole] It is a poached egg. Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,871991,873330,- Why don't you just pick it up and bite it?
vzyo5siH224,873330,874423,- I need a knife.
vzyo5siH224,875270,877380,"- [Link] Oh, my gosh. You just-"
vzyo5siH224,877380,878230,- Hollandaise.
vzyo5siH224,878230,879550,- You just put it in the fridge?
vzyo5siH224,879550,880383,- [Nicole] Yeah.
vzyo5siH224,880383,881216,- Hollan-freezed.
vzyo5siH224,881216,882549,- [Nicole] That's the show.
vzyo5siH224,884969,887820,"- You can see, I got to the post egg that."
vzyo5siH224,887820,889180,"Oh, look."
vzyo5siH224,889180,890610,Just in case you're wondering if it was poached.
vzyo5siH224,890610,892300,"Look, there it is running."
vzyo5siH224,892300,893980,But it's cold.
vzyo5siH224,893980,896023,- This has put me in a bad head space.
vzyo5siH224,897120,901320,I know I was mean to you at the end of the last round.
vzyo5siH224,901320,904580,"Now, I'm getting my just desserts."
vzyo5siH224,904580,906150,- I hate both of these.
vzyo5siH224,906150,907970,"- Me, too, man. - I think I hate these more."
vzyo5siH224,907970,910100,- I hate this more.
vzyo5siH224,910100,912940,- I would say because this is something that-
vzyo5siH224,912940,913962,- [Link] Just give it a name.
vzyo5siH224,913962,915860,"- It's Rockefellers, but not done in-"
vzyo5siH224,915860,918170,- Hot oyster. A hoyster.
vzyo5siH224,918170,919769,Give it. It's a hoyster.
vzyo5siH224,919770,921030,- Hold on. You like this?
vzyo5siH224,921030,921863,- No.
vzyo5siH224,921863,922696,- You hate this more?
vzyo5siH224,922696,926203,"- Yeah, which is why I'm trying to do this."
vzyo5siH224,927070,928250,- So you like this one more?
vzyo5siH224,928250,929370,Okay. I agree.
vzyo5siH224,929370,930290,"- Yeah, Rhett."
vzyo5siH224,930290,931940,- I don't really have an opinion.
vzyo5siH224,933680,934513,I'm neutral.
vzyo5siH224,934513,935810,- [Stevie] (laughing) That's exciting.
vzyo5siH224,935810,937412,- They're both bad.
vzyo5siH224,937412,939718,"- Do your job, man! Have an opinion!"
vzyo5siH224,939718,941570,- [Stevie] 60% of the Mythical Beasts thought
vzyo5siH224,941570,944794,that you would like the cold eggs Benedict better.
vzyo5siH224,944794,945627,(buzzer dinging)
vzyo5siH224,945627,946880,"- See, now we're gonna feel even better"
vzyo5siH224,946880,948380,about putting this on Instagram.
vzyo5siH224,948380,949490,- You only got one right.
vzyo5siH224,949490,951250,- You had already lost.
vzyo5siH224,951250,954640,We had to be honest and I'm glad it didn't come down to this
vzyo5siH224,954640,957360,"because apparently, you didn't care."
vzyo5siH224,957360,958829,"- Well, no, they also had already lost."
vzyo5siH224,958830,960410,- Right. That's what I'm saying.
