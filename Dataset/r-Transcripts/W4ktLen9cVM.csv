W4ktLen9cVM,399,1680,yeah i don't know if i'll talk about
W4ktLen9cVM,1680,4000,them all but i got all sorts of fun
W4ktLen9cVM,4000,7359,blood draining devices and this one is
W4ktLen9cVM,7359,9440,for closing mouths
W4ktLen9cVM,9440,11759,kind of cool hi i'm victor m sweeney and
W4ktLen9cVM,11759,13360,i'm a licensed funeral director and
W4ktLen9cVM,13360,15040,mortician and this is
W4ktLen9cVM,15040,16660,mortician support
W4ktLen9cVM,16660,19119,[Music]
W4ktLen9cVM,19119,21439,this is a question from saint severin
W4ktLen9cVM,21439,23119,question for morticians
W4ktLen9cVM,23119,25199,when someone dies do you remove their
W4ktLen9cVM,25199,27359,poo or are we all buried
W4ktLen9cVM,27359,30640,with an unpoo'd poo
W4ktLen9cVM,30640,32480,that is such a good question more often
W4ktLen9cVM,32480,34079,than not your poo is
W4ktLen9cVM,34079,35920,up to you sometimes you you hear the
W4ktLen9cVM,35920,37200,myth that everybody uh
W4ktLen9cVM,37200,39040,poos themselves before they die that's
W4ktLen9cVM,39040,41200,not always the case sometimes it is
W4ktLen9cVM,41200,43120,for my purposes when i get someone back
W4ktLen9cVM,43120,44480,to the funeral home and i'm preparing
W4ktLen9cVM,44480,45200,them
W4ktLen9cVM,45200,47760,um if they have pooed then i'll clean
W4ktLen9cVM,47760,48239,them up
W4ktLen9cVM,48239,49840,if it's the case that they start pooing
W4ktLen9cVM,49840,51120,when pressure starts to build up in the
W4ktLen9cVM,51120,51760,abdomen
W4ktLen9cVM,51760,53440,then i stop what i'm doing i clean them
W4ktLen9cVM,53440,55039,up typically what i'll do is i'll
W4ktLen9cVM,55039,55600,actually
W4ktLen9cVM,55600,57199,flush out the bowels with the hose
W4ktLen9cVM,57199,58719,because the last thing you want to have
W4ktLen9cVM,58719,59280,happen
W4ktLen9cVM,59280,61120,is someone to start pooing and then they
W4ktLen9cVM,61120,63039,continue doing it when you can't control
W4ktLen9cVM,63039,63440,it
W4ktLen9cVM,63440,65840,jaded never won if a person wearing
W4ktLen9cVM,65840,67280,contacts dies
W4ktLen9cVM,67280,69760,does the mortician take them out shower
W4ktLen9cVM,69760,70799,thoughts
W4ktLen9cVM,70799,73280,yes historically i've always removed
W4ktLen9cVM,73280,75040,contact lenses because one of the things
W4ktLen9cVM,75040,76320,that we need to do
W4ktLen9cVM,76320,78400,of course is what we call set the
W4ktLen9cVM,78400,80159,features setting the features would mean
W4ktLen9cVM,80159,80799,that we
W4ktLen9cVM,80799,82400,close the mouth and we also need to
W4ktLen9cVM,82400,84320,close their eyes so we actually have
W4ktLen9cVM,84320,87680,a device that helps us do this
W4ktLen9cVM,87680,89520,these are called eye caps they're
W4ktLen9cVM,89520,91040,essentially spiky
W4ktLen9cVM,91040,93600,contact lenses that fit over the eyes
W4ktLen9cVM,93600,94320,and will actually
W4ktLen9cVM,94320,96560,grip the eyelid when we pull it down
W4ktLen9cVM,96560,98479,over those little burrs there
W4ktLen9cVM,98479,100479,i typically remove contact lenses um
W4ktLen9cVM,100479,101920,because those just get in the way
W4ktLen9cVM,101920,104159,of me doing what i need to do to set
W4ktLen9cVM,104159,106240,their features and provide a decent
W4ktLen9cVM,106240,107840,appearance for the family
W4ktLen9cVM,107840,110479,question from laney will my cat eat me
W4ktLen9cVM,110479,111439,when i die
W4ktLen9cVM,111439,114399,possibly hopefully i think the short
W4ktLen9cVM,114399,116320,answer to that is yes
W4ktLen9cVM,116320,117600,i've heard of that happening from
W4ktLen9cVM,117600,119439,colleagues of mine and as we all know
W4ktLen9cVM,119439,121759,cats being inferior to dogs they will do
W4ktLen9cVM,121759,123600,anything they are opportunists
W4ktLen9cVM,123600,126399,the question from vamp florence how do
W4ktLen9cVM,126399,128080,morticians not want to chug the
W4ktLen9cVM,128080,129280,embalming fluid
W4ktLen9cVM,129280,130640,these look like they taste like fruit
W4ktLen9cVM,130640,132720,loops well i really love
W4ktLen9cVM,132720,136640,the picture you have and i noticed
W4ktLen9cVM,136640,138640,you forgot the blue flavor embalming
W4ktLen9cVM,138640,140239,fluid is really colorful
W4ktLen9cVM,140239,142959,but i can assure you it is not tasty it
W4ktLen9cVM,142959,144000,smells
W4ktLen9cVM,144000,146160,awful as far as the coloring goes it is
W4ktLen9cVM,146160,147920,strange isn't it one of the reasons that
W4ktLen9cVM,147920,148640,a lot of these
W4ktLen9cVM,148640,151360,fluids are maybe red or other colors is
W4ktLen9cVM,151360,152480,so that the embalmer
W4ktLen9cVM,152480,154080,knows what they are without having to
W4ktLen9cVM,154080,155599,maybe read the label but you'll also
W4ktLen9cVM,155599,157360,notice that a couple of them are red
W4ktLen9cVM,157360,159280,when we push the blood out of the body
W4ktLen9cVM,159280,161280,in arterial embalming we're pushing out
W4ktLen9cVM,161280,162239,a red fluid
W4ktLen9cVM,162239,164080,so ideally we want to put a red fluid
W4ktLen9cVM,164080,166560,back in so we gain access to an artery
W4ktLen9cVM,166560,168080,typically we'll make an incision maybe
W4ktLen9cVM,168080,169680,in the neck or in the thigh
W4ktLen9cVM,169680,171200,and then we'll also gain access to a
W4ktLen9cVM,171200,174160,vein we open the artery
W4ktLen9cVM,174160,175360,we are going to have an embalming
W4ktLen9cVM,175360,177280,machine which acts as a pump and we're
W4ktLen9cVM,177280,177920,going to use
W4ktLen9cVM,177920,180319,this arterial tube something like this
W4ktLen9cVM,180319,181200,so this goes
W4ktLen9cVM,181200,183040,down the artery and then it's going to
W4ktLen9cVM,183040,185440,pump fluid through now your vein
W4ktLen9cVM,185440,188239,we are gonna open with either a large
W4ktLen9cVM,188239,190319,forceps or this device called a drain
W4ktLen9cVM,190319,193360,tube so this goes down
W4ktLen9cVM,193360,196480,the vein and then when we open it
W4ktLen9cVM,196480,198720,the blood will pour out the side of our
W4ktLen9cVM,198720,200560,device here and then we can control
W4ktLen9cVM,200560,202640,how quickly or how slowly we want the
W4ktLen9cVM,202640,204480,blood to leave the body
W4ktLen9cVM,204480,206560,when we have a deceased loved one
W4ktLen9cVM,206560,208080,they're going to look very very pale
W4ktLen9cVM,208080,208959,because the blood has stopped
W4ktLen9cVM,208959,211360,circulating so when we put in the the
W4ktLen9cVM,211360,212080,red blood
W4ktLen9cVM,212080,214000,the red fluid rather that's actually
W4ktLen9cVM,214000,215599,going to pink them up in some ways and
W4ktLen9cVM,215599,218000,make them look a little bit more alive
W4ktLen9cVM,218000,220480,this is a question from clementine okay
W4ktLen9cVM,220480,221440,full disclosure
W4ktLen9cVM,221440,223840,i'm fat and this is a legit question i'm
W4ktLen9cVM,223840,226239,not trying to be fat phobic but how do
W4ktLen9cVM,226239,227519,extremely obese people
W4ktLen9cVM,227519,230000,like i'm talking 400 pounds fit in a
W4ktLen9cVM,230000,230799,coffin
W4ktLen9cVM,230799,233040,do they make a plus size coffin or does
W4ktLen9cVM,233040,234000,a mortician like
W4ktLen9cVM,234000,236319,cut fat out of them and sew them back up
W4ktLen9cVM,236319,237439,gonna answer the second part of that
W4ktLen9cVM,237439,238560,question first
W4ktLen9cVM,238560,240959,no we do not remove fat and and sew
W4ktLen9cVM,240959,241599,someone back
W4ktLen9cVM,241599,243840,up everybody is buried intact if we can
W4ktLen9cVM,243840,244640,at all help it
W4ktLen9cVM,244640,246879,so we actually have caskets that are are
W4ktLen9cVM,246879,248640,made by our manufacturer to be
W4ktLen9cVM,248640,250879,oversized typically when someone passes
W4ktLen9cVM,250879,252560,away if they're larger we'll measure
W4ktLen9cVM,252560,254080,them at their elbows because those tend
W4ktLen9cVM,254080,255439,to be the parts that stick out the
W4ktLen9cVM,255439,256959,furthest and then determine
W4ktLen9cVM,256959,259280,what width of casket we will need to
W4ktLen9cVM,259280,261440,give them a more comfortable appearance
W4ktLen9cVM,261440,264320,c for chase do morticians put chapstick
W4ktLen9cVM,264320,265280,on the bodies or
W4ktLen9cVM,265280,267440,are they just sitting there casket open
W4ktLen9cVM,267440,268560,lips cracked out
W4ktLen9cVM,268560,270160,that's actually a great concern of ours
W4ktLen9cVM,270160,272479,is drying out not just the lips
W4ktLen9cVM,272479,274479,but after you die of course your body is
W4ktLen9cVM,274479,276639,not producing any oils
W4ktLen9cVM,276639,279040,so your skin can get quite dry we
W4ktLen9cVM,279040,279919,actually have a
W4ktLen9cVM,279919,282240,like a heavy face cream that we use on
W4ktLen9cVM,282240,283840,almost everybody that comes through
W4ktLen9cVM,283840,285199,in the interim between when they're
W4ktLen9cVM,285199,287440,embalmed and when we get them ready for
W4ktLen9cVM,287440,289040,their funeral and put their makeup on if
W4ktLen9cVM,289040,289759,we need it
W4ktLen9cVM,289759,291360,we always have that heavy face cream on
W4ktLen9cVM,291360,293040,to make sure that their lips don't dry
W4ktLen9cVM,293040,294800,out so as far as chapstick goes i've
W4ktLen9cVM,294800,296639,never put chapstick on a body but if
W4ktLen9cVM,296639,298400,someone really wanted me to i guess i
W4ktLen9cVM,298400,300720,i wouldn't say no here's a question from
W4ktLen9cVM,300720,301520,coco
W4ktLen9cVM,301520,303440,now i'm going on google looking up the
W4ktLen9cVM,303440,304720,weirdest stuff
W4ktLen9cVM,304720,307600,what do dead bodies smell like dead
W4ktLen9cVM,307600,308240,bodies
W4ktLen9cVM,308240,311039,smell awful rotting anything smells
W4ktLen9cVM,311039,313039,awful we are hardwired to think that
W4ktLen9cVM,313039,314160,dead human bodies
W4ktLen9cVM,314160,316320,smell bad and it's a smell you never
W4ktLen9cVM,316320,317840,forget i myself
W4ktLen9cVM,317840,319600,i went out to a nice restaurant to have
W4ktLen9cVM,319600,321759,some aged steak and i couldn't do it
W4ktLen9cVM,321759,323840,i love this username this is a question
W4ktLen9cVM,323840,325600,from future corpse
W4ktLen9cVM,325600,328240,aren't we all what do morticians do with
W4ktLen9cVM,328240,328960,our organs
W4ktLen9cVM,328960,330960,after an embalming what happens when
W4ktLen9cVM,330960,332160,they aren't donated
W4ktLen9cVM,332160,334080,when we do embalming all your organs
W4ktLen9cVM,334080,335680,just stay inside your body we can
W4ktLen9cVM,335680,336479,prepare them all
W4ktLen9cVM,336479,338720,internally after we finish the arterial
W4ktLen9cVM,338720,340639,embalming we have what's called the
W4ktLen9cVM,340639,343120,cavity embalming optimally with the
W4ktLen9cVM,343120,344560,cavity embalming you're trying to
W4ktLen9cVM,344560,346080,puncture the lungs
W4ktLen9cVM,346080,349600,the heart the intestines the stomach
W4ktLen9cVM,349600,350720,and then you're also going to try to
W4ktLen9cVM,350720,352639,shoot for the kidneys too we actually
W4ktLen9cVM,352639,355919,use what's called a trocar and i i have
W4ktLen9cVM,355919,356479,one here
W4ktLen9cVM,356479,359759,it's a hollow point spear essentially
W4ktLen9cVM,359759,361759,and it hooks up to what we call an
W4ktLen9cVM,361759,363120,aspirator so it's a
W4ktLen9cVM,363120,365520,it's a vacuum essentially insert this in
W4ktLen9cVM,365520,366319,the abdomen
W4ktLen9cVM,366319,368560,and then try to puncture all the hollow
W4ktLen9cVM,368560,370560,organs and then the vacuum will actually
W4ktLen9cVM,370560,372319,draw out all those nasty fluids
W4ktLen9cVM,372319,374000,if you donate your organs typically
W4ktLen9cVM,374000,375680,organ donations are handled
W4ktLen9cVM,375680,378000,by organ harvesting companies and they
W4ktLen9cVM,378000,379759,will actually work with a hospital or
W4ktLen9cVM,379759,380000,with
W4ktLen9cVM,380000,382319,me to transport a body where it needs to
W4ktLen9cVM,382319,384240,go and then they'll harvest the organs
W4ktLen9cVM,384240,385840,donate them where they need to and then
W4ktLen9cVM,385840,387440,the body will be returned to me
W4ktLen9cVM,387440,389520,after that whole process is done
W4ktLen9cVM,389520,391280,question from paul matthews
W4ktLen9cVM,391280,393120,do morticians normally just drain the
W4ktLen9cVM,393120,394560,blood down the sink
W4ktLen9cVM,394560,396639,the short answer is yes all of our
W4ktLen9cVM,396639,398639,bodily wastes are disposed
W4ktLen9cVM,398639,400720,just like our normal bodily wastes the
W4ktLen9cVM,400720,401919,sewer system
W4ktLen9cVM,401919,403600,that goes right to the water treatment
W4ktLen9cVM,403600,406160,plant this is a question from soggy emma
W4ktLen9cVM,406160,408400,why are coffins so expensive y'all just
W4ktLen9cVM,408400,409360,bury me raw
W4ktLen9cVM,409360,412080,well soggy emma that is uh definitely an
W4ktLen9cVM,412080,412720,option
W4ktLen9cVM,412720,414720,you can be buried in the ground without
W4ktLen9cVM,414720,416479,a casket a lot of funeral homes
W4ktLen9cVM,416479,418639,put substantial markups on their casket
W4ktLen9cVM,418639,420400,and i think it's just a way to collect
W4ktLen9cVM,420400,422639,money on on the tail end of a service
W4ktLen9cVM,422639,424160,but just like a furniture store
W4ktLen9cVM,424160,426319,which would maybe mark up their kitchen
W4ktLen9cVM,426319,428240,tables four times what they actually
W4ktLen9cVM,428240,429039,cost
W4ktLen9cVM,429039,430880,i would guess that most caskets are
W4ktLen9cVM,430880,433360,marked up probably one and a half to two
W4ktLen9cVM,433360,434080,times
W4ktLen9cVM,434080,436319,what the wholesale cost is this is a
W4ktLen9cVM,436319,438160,question from tiny rain
W4ktLen9cVM,438160,441759,do morticians put a bra on you if so
W4ktLen9cVM,441759,443759,i would like my rotting corpse to not
W4ktLen9cVM,443759,446080,wear a bra and would like my ghost to be
W4ktLen9cVM,446080,448479,wandering braless with poking nips
W4ktLen9cVM,448479,450240,well tiny rain i don't know if there's
W4ktLen9cVM,450240,452400,much i can do about poking nips
W4ktLen9cVM,452400,454560,but we do put bras on if the family
W4ktLen9cVM,454560,456240,requests and the reality is i've
W4ktLen9cVM,456240,458400,probably put on more bras than i have
W4ktLen9cVM,458400,461120,taken off in my life
W4ktLen9cVM,461120,464400,that answer your question this is a
W4ktLen9cVM,464400,465120,question from
W4ktLen9cVM,465120,467919,leonard de montague does a mortician
W4ktLen9cVM,467919,470160,feel just as sad as a normal person
W4ktLen9cVM,470160,472240,when someone close to them dies the
W4ktLen9cVM,472240,473440,short answer of that is
W4ktLen9cVM,473440,476000,yes that was one of the things actually
W4ktLen9cVM,476000,477840,i myself really worried about when i got
W4ktLen9cVM,477840,479039,into this profession because at a
W4ktLen9cVM,479039,480319,certain point
W4ktLen9cVM,480319,482479,when you see a dead body you almost
W4ktLen9cVM,482479,484160,always kind of go into work mode
W4ktLen9cVM,484160,485919,what can i do to help this family what
W4ktLen9cVM,485919,487199,can i do to prepare
W4ktLen9cVM,487199,489280,this body so i was very concerned when i
W4ktLen9cVM,489280,491120,started doing this that maybe i
W4ktLen9cVM,491120,492879,would start to even think of my own
W4ktLen9cVM,492879,494800,loved ones as something to help or
W4ktLen9cVM,494800,496080,something to fix
W4ktLen9cVM,496080,498240,and not really take in grief like i used
W4ktLen9cVM,498240,500000,to for my own family for
W4ktLen9cVM,500000,502639,loved ones my own grandpa passed away
W4ktLen9cVM,502639,504080,just a few months ago
W4ktLen9cVM,504080,506080,and i feel just as sad about that as i i
W4ktLen9cVM,506080,507120,think i ever would
W4ktLen9cVM,507120,509199,it's just a matter of of perspective and
W4ktLen9cVM,509199,510160,maybe where you're at
W4ktLen9cVM,510160,512959,at the moment question from t what
W4ktLen9cVM,512959,513919,foundation
W4ktLen9cVM,513919,515760,do funeral directors use to make dead
W4ktLen9cVM,515760,517279,people look alive
W4ktLen9cVM,517279,518640,well that's a good question all the
W4ktLen9cVM,518640,520399,makeup we use is actually
W4ktLen9cVM,520399,523440,formulated for dead people so it's made
W4ktLen9cVM,523440,524080,to go
W4ktLen9cVM,524080,526240,on cold skin as opposed to warm skin
W4ktLen9cVM,526240,527600,like regular makeup and one of the
W4ktLen9cVM,527600,529040,things we we try to do
W4ktLen9cVM,529040,531360,is not cake people with makeup but just
W4ktLen9cVM,531360,533279,do kind of light layers so that way
W4ktLen9cVM,533279,534800,their actual skin tone does
W4ktLen9cVM,534800,536080,shine through a little bit if you've
W4ktLen9cVM,536080,537760,ever gone to a funeral and maybe you've
W4ktLen9cVM,537760,539200,seen someone in the casket who is caked
W4ktLen9cVM,539200,539839,with makeup
W4ktLen9cVM,539839,541120,they don't really look like themselves
W4ktLen9cVM,541120,543040,so one of our goals is to tone that down
W4ktLen9cVM,543040,543680,a little bit
W4ktLen9cVM,543680,545760,so they do question from lala
W4ktLen9cVM,545760,547680,approximately how much does a mortician
W4ktLen9cVM,547680,548240,make
W4ktLen9cVM,548240,550720,the minimum and the maximum i really
W4ktLen9cVM,550720,551440,couldn't say
W4ktLen9cVM,551440,553839,what the minimum and maximum are the
W4ktLen9cVM,553839,554560,average
W4ktLen9cVM,554560,557360,i've read in the country is about 65 000
W4ktLen9cVM,557360,558959,a year and talking to my other friends
W4ktLen9cVM,558959,560320,and colleagues that seems to be
W4ktLen9cVM,560320,562640,about the average for my area as well
W4ktLen9cVM,562640,564000,opia dana
W4ktLen9cVM,564000,566480,can you get half your body cremated and
W4ktLen9cVM,566480,567920,the other half buried
W4ktLen9cVM,567920,570640,do morticians do that asking for a
W4ktLen9cVM,570640,571200,friend
W4ktLen9cVM,571200,573200,i have never done that and i've never
W4ktLen9cVM,573200,574560,had anybody ask
W4ktLen9cVM,574560,576399,i guess i could see it happening if you
W4ktLen9cVM,576399,578480,really wanted to you would have to have
W4ktLen9cVM,578480,580480,a disposition permit that would have
W4ktLen9cVM,580480,581920,cremation and burial
W4ktLen9cVM,581920,583200,and i guess we'd probably have to sign a
W4ktLen9cVM,583200,585040,waiver to uh cut
W4ktLen9cVM,585040,586959,someone in half but maybe the bigger
W4ktLen9cVM,586959,588240,question would be
W4ktLen9cVM,588240,589680,what half are you gonna cremate and what
W4ktLen9cVM,589680,592480,half do you bury
W4ktLen9cVM,592480,594480,this is a question from that doodle
W4ktLen9cVM,594480,596399,bunny how do morticians handle their
W4ktLen9cVM,596399,596880,jobs
W4ktLen9cVM,596880,599360,without becoming emotional wrecks that
W4ktLen9cVM,599360,600320,is a good question
W4ktLen9cVM,600320,602880,most morticians i know are pretty normal
W4ktLen9cVM,602880,604079,people there are times where it's
W4ktLen9cVM,604079,604720,emotional
W4ktLen9cVM,604720,606320,so you do feel it and there are maybe
W4ktLen9cVM,606320,607839,days you come home where you just
W4ktLen9cVM,607839,609839,feel done and you don't want to work or
W4ktLen9cVM,609839,610880,maybe do what you're
W4ktLen9cVM,610880,612720,doing anymore but i think the fact that
W4ktLen9cVM,612720,614240,you can actually help people on
W4ktLen9cVM,614240,616079,on my side of the desk on this side of
W4ktLen9cVM,616079,618240,things there are things that you can do
W4ktLen9cVM,618240,619920,that maybe nobody else can do you can
W4ktLen9cVM,619920,622480,provide a chance for a mother to
W4ktLen9cVM,622480,624320,see her son one more time it's those
W4ktLen9cVM,624320,625680,kind of things that keep you going
W4ktLen9cVM,625680,628399,in those hard times this question is
W4ktLen9cVM,628399,628959,from
W4ktLen9cVM,628959,632000,not waving how do you dress the deceased
W4ktLen9cVM,632000,634160,i have theories well i would love to
W4ktLen9cVM,634160,635839,hear what your theories are but really
W4ktLen9cVM,635839,636160,it's
W4ktLen9cVM,636160,638160,fairly simple you're just gonna work
W4ktLen9cVM,638160,640160,their arms through just like you dress a
W4ktLen9cVM,640160,643519,baby maybe oftentimes if we have someone
W4ktLen9cVM,643519,645760,maybe very large that we can't move very
W4ktLen9cVM,645760,647680,well or maybe someone who
W4ktLen9cVM,647680,649200,has outgrown their clothes or maybe
W4ktLen9cVM,649200,650800,their clothes are too big will often
W4ktLen9cVM,650800,651920,time make cuts
W4ktLen9cVM,651920,654720,down the back and simply drape it over
W4ktLen9cVM,654720,655519,the front
W4ktLen9cVM,655519,657279,and tuck it under the back maybe sew it
W4ktLen9cVM,657279,659200,in a couple places so that way it sits
W4ktLen9cVM,659200,660160,right on the person
W4ktLen9cVM,660160,661680,and doesn't look like a like an over
W4ktLen9cVM,661680,663519,large tent or squeeze them into their
W4ktLen9cVM,663519,664720,clothes like a sausage
W4ktLen9cVM,664720,667839,this is a question from trap jason
W4ktLen9cVM,667839,669760,why don't we bury people vertically
W4ktLen9cVM,669760,671360,instead of horizontally
W4ktLen9cVM,671360,673360,they are already dead so why does it
W4ktLen9cVM,673360,676079,matter we could save so much space
W4ktLen9cVM,676079,677920,that is a great question i think a lot
W4ktLen9cVM,677920,679760,of it has to do with practicality
W4ktLen9cVM,679760,681279,so if you were to bury someone
W4ktLen9cVM,681279,683279,vertically you'd have to dig pretty deep
W4ktLen9cVM,683279,683760,hole
W4ktLen9cVM,683760,685519,and it would have to be pretty narrow
W4ktLen9cVM,685519,687200,you can imagine how tough it would be
W4ktLen9cVM,687200,687600,for
W4ktLen9cVM,687600,689279,let's say six people to carry a casket
W4ktLen9cVM,689279,691360,to the graveside and then turn it up on
W4ktLen9cVM,691360,692880,its end and drop
W4ktLen9cVM,692880,695040,grandma down the hole you might need a
W4ktLen9cVM,695040,696560,like a seat belt of some kind
W4ktLen9cVM,696560,699760,question from crowbar jones what does a
W4ktLen9cVM,699760,700720,mortician do
W4ktLen9cVM,700720,703519,if are artificial nails on a corpse keep
W4ktLen9cVM,703519,704320,them
W4ktLen9cVM,704320,707360,take them off asking for a friend i hope
W4ktLen9cVM,707360,708880,you don't mean keep them by keeping a
W4ktLen9cVM,708880,710399,collection
W4ktLen9cVM,710399,712800,but if you mean keeping them on um more
W4ktLen9cVM,712800,713519,often than not
W4ktLen9cVM,713519,715920,i will typically the artificial nails
W4ktLen9cVM,715920,716639,look nice
W4ktLen9cVM,716639,717839,clean and of course your nails
W4ktLen9cVM,717839,719360,underneath are pretty rough if they have
W4ktLen9cVM,719360,721040,them on i usually keep them
W4ktLen9cVM,721040,722240,other things that people might be
W4ktLen9cVM,722240,724399,concerned about removing piercings
W4ktLen9cVM,724399,726720,they almost always stay if it's an ear
W4ktLen9cVM,726720,728320,piercing and they have their earrings in
W4ktLen9cVM,728320,729680,maybe we'll take the earrings out clean
W4ktLen9cVM,729680,731200,them up a little bit other body
W4ktLen9cVM,731200,731920,piercings
W4ktLen9cVM,731920,733600,i always leave them in this is a
W4ktLen9cVM,733600,735200,question from melody jackson
W4ktLen9cVM,735200,737120,do morticians take makeup classes when
W4ktLen9cVM,737120,738720,getting their certifications
W4ktLen9cVM,738720,741279,yes we do i have a four year degree and
W4ktLen9cVM,741279,743200,at my college we took courses
W4ktLen9cVM,743200,745760,on what they call restorative art so
W4ktLen9cVM,745760,747040,this would include things
W4ktLen9cVM,747040,749279,like makeup and coloring but it would
W4ktLen9cVM,749279,750240,also include things
W4ktLen9cVM,750240,752959,like putting people back together after
W4ktLen9cVM,752959,753920,accidents
W4ktLen9cVM,753920,756320,sculpting an ear if someone has lost an
W4ktLen9cVM,756320,757279,ear lip
W4ktLen9cVM,757279,760560,boy do morticians also give haircuts
W4ktLen9cVM,760560,763279,anyone no one that can do a nice fade
W4ktLen9cVM,763279,763760,yeah
W4ktLen9cVM,763760,765920,lip boy i do give haircuts every so
W4ktLen9cVM,765920,767839,often usually only to men
W4ktLen9cVM,767839,769839,and usually only if it's something minor
W4ktLen9cVM,769839,771519,if someone does need to get their hair
W4ktLen9cVM,771519,773040,done we'll actually usually call a
W4ktLen9cVM,773040,774079,hairdresser in
W4ktLen9cVM,774079,775600,it's fairly simple because really you're
W4ktLen9cVM,775600,777200,only working with the
W4ktLen9cVM,777200,779360,front and the sides of the head this is
W4ktLen9cVM,779360,780399,a question from
W4ktLen9cVM,780399,783200,veronica say a body gets exhumed after
W4ktLen9cVM,783200,784240,two years
W4ktLen9cVM,784240,786240,what should be the state of the body to
W4ktLen9cVM,786240,787680,be expected to be
W4ktLen9cVM,787680,788800,that's one of the interesting things
W4ktLen9cVM,788800,790639,about my job is that i never actually
W4ktLen9cVM,790639,791680,know
W4ktLen9cVM,791680,794320,what happens after burial if we had an
W4ktLen9cVM,794320,796000,exclamation um you actually have to have
W4ktLen9cVM,796000,797040,a court order
W4ktLen9cVM,797040,799279,to open the vault and open the casket
W4ktLen9cVM,799279,800320,i've heard of cases
W4ktLen9cVM,800320,802880,where they've opened the casket and the
W4ktLen9cVM,802880,804720,body looks more or less unchanged and
W4ktLen9cVM,804720,806880,this was maybe 50 years after the fact
W4ktLen9cVM,806880,808880,this is a question from jonathan cowep
W4ktLen9cVM,808880,810880,monty pythons always look on the bright
W4ktLen9cVM,810880,812800,side of life as the nation's number one
W4ktLen9cVM,812800,814079,funeral song
W4ktLen9cVM,814079,815920,what's the oddest funeral music you've
W4ktLen9cVM,815920,817360,ever heard i haven't
W4ktLen9cVM,817360,819279,heard too many strange funeral songs
W4ktLen9cVM,819279,821360,myself but i do have this dream
W4ktLen9cVM,821360,822800,i have a friend and i told him if he
W4ktLen9cVM,822800,824480,passes away before i do
W4ktLen9cVM,824480,826639,i'd really like to sing on eagles wings
W4ktLen9cVM,826639,828079,but like the swedish chef from the
W4ktLen9cVM,828079,829279,muppets
W4ktLen9cVM,829279,832800,it would sound like this you he'd really
W4ktLen9cVM,832800,834310,initiative
W4ktLen9cVM,834310,836480,[Music]
W4ktLen9cVM,836480,837150,relief
W4ktLen9cVM,837150,839680,[Laughter]
W4ktLen9cVM,839680,841600,and that's it that's all your questions
W4ktLen9cVM,841600,843040,i sure enjoyed answering them
W4ktLen9cVM,843040,850399,and i hope you learned something
