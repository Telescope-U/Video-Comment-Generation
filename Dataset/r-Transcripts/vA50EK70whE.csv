vA50EK70whE,230,5680,- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast  where we discuss science  and science-based tools for everyday life.
vA50EK70whE,8440,15599,"- I'm Andrew Huberman,  and I'm a professor of neurobiology  and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine."
vA50EK70whE,15600,20800,"This podcast is separate  from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.  It is however, part of my desire"
vA50EK70whE,20800,25520,"and effort to bring you zero cost to consumer information  about science and science related tools,"
vA50EK70whE,26320,32560,along those lines I'd like to thank  the sponsors of today's podcast.  Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
vA50EK70whE,32560,39760,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin  mineral probiotic drink.  I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012
vA50EK70whE,39760,44960,and so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast.  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens is
vA50EK70whE,44960,50800,because I found it rather dizzying  to know which vitamins and minerals to take  and Athletic Greens covers all my bases
vA50EK70whE,50800,58800,for vitamins and minerals.  It also includes probiotics and there are now a lot  of data supporting the fact that probiotics are important
vA50EK70whE,58800,64559,"for the gut brain access, for immunity  for metabolic health, endocrine health, many, many things."
vA50EK70whE,64559,70000,"So I take Athletic Greens once,  sometimes twice a day  I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice"
vA50EK70whE,70000,76880,and to me it tastes delicious.  If you'd like to try Athletic Greens  you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
vA50EK70whE,76880,83120,and if you do that they'll also give  you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.  There are a lot of data now showing
vA50EK70whE,83120,88160,that vitamin D3 is important  for immune function and a number  of other important biological processes.
vA50EK70whE,88720,94880,"In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman  you'll get five free travel packs,"
vA50EK70whE,94880,101040,"travel packs make it easy to mix up  Athletic Greens when you're in the car,  on the plane or generally on the road."
vA50EK70whE,101040,106560,So that's Athletic Greens.com to get Athletic Greens.  The year supply of vitamin D3 and K2
vA50EK70whE,106560,111840,and the five free travel packs.  Our second sponsor of today's podcast is Headspace.
vA50EK70whE,111840,118240,Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.  I've been meditating on and off since I was 16 years old.
vA50EK70whE,118240,125520,"I'm 45 now.  So that's about 30 years of on and off meditation  and I confess most of that time it was off,"
vA50EK70whE,125520,130959,meaning I find it really hard to stick  to a meditation practice.  A few years ago I discovered Headspace
vA50EK70whE,130960,137440,while flying on JetBlue flights  'cause at that time they were offering Headspace  as something you could watch instead of TV or movies.
vA50EK70whE,137440,143120,"And it made me feel great.  I'd find that I arrived  where I was going, more rested, more relaxed"
vA50EK70whE,143120,151120,and I got the Headspace app and I started using it daily  and I've continued to use it daily.  Headspace has a large number of meditations
vA50EK70whE,151120,157200,all supported by science.  There's also now just a tremendous amount of science  supporting a meditation practice
vA50EK70whE,157200,163440,"for all sorts of things like improved sleep,  reduced impulsivity, improved cognition."
vA50EK70whE,163440,169280,There are just a myriad of positive effects of meditation.  The hardest thing is doing it  and Headspace makes that easy.
vA50EK70whE,169280,176480,"If you wanna try the Headspace app  and all the meditations they have, you can go  to headspace.com/special offer, and you'll get"
vA50EK70whE,176480,182799,one month completely free of all the meditations  they have that's headspace.com/special offer to
vA50EK70whE,182800,187840,get one month free of Headspace.  The third sponsor of today's podcast is magic spoon.
vA50EK70whE,187840,194640,"Magic spoon is a low carb,  grain-free keto friendly cereal.  As I've mentioned a few times before on this podcast"
vA50EK70whE,194640,200560,the way I eat throughout the day has everything to do  with when I wanna be alert and when I wanna be sleepy.  So in the first part of the day
vA50EK70whE,200560,208480,I fast because that enhances alertness.  Then I eat keto.  So my lunch and my afternoon meals are ketogenic
vA50EK70whE,208480,216799,"and then in the evening I eat starches  and vegetables because those aid the transition to sleep.  So for me, magic spoon as a keto cereal is a great snack."
vA50EK70whE,216800,222080,It's really tasty.  I don't actually mix mine with milk.  I just eat it directly.  They have a bunch of different flavors.
vA50EK70whE,222640,228480,I like the frosted flavor also  because it tastes like donuts.  And I have a pastry affliction and I love pastries.
vA50EK70whE,229040,234080,So magic spoon allows me to remain  on keto during the day it's healthy.  It tastes great.
vA50EK70whE,234080,239360,I really enjoy it.  So if you wanna try magic spoon  you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
vA50EK70whE,239360,245680,for a variety pack of different flavors.  And if you put Huberman at checkout  you'll get 5 dollars off the variety pack.
vA50EK70whE,245680,251120,That's magicspoon.com/huberman to try a variety pack  of different flavors of magic spoon keto
vA50EK70whE,251120,255280,"grain-free low carb cereal  put ""Huberman"" at checkout you get 5 dollars off."
vA50EK70whE,256160,262320,A quick note before we begin today's discussion  about the neuroscience of motivation.  I'm pleased to announce
vA50EK70whE,262320,268960,"that we have now captioned episodes one  and two in Spanish and soon, all the episodes"
vA50EK70whE,268960,274400,of the Huberman Lab Podcast will be captioned  on YouTube in Spanish.  We've used some of the revenue
vA50EK70whE,274400,280319,from the podcast to hire expert captioners.  So it should be accurate.  You might catch a mistake here
vA50EK70whE,280320,286800,"or there a dialect difference from time to time  but by our read and by our experts reads,"
vA50EK70whE,287520,294960,it's all accurate.  So we're very pleased that people who speak Spanish  and digest information best in Spanish can now
vA50EK70whE,294960,302160,digest the information here on the podcast.  Thanks to everyone for supporting the podcast  which allows us to broaden our reach in these ways
vA50EK70whE,302160,307840,"and we do hope to expand  to other languages in the very near future.  This month, we're talking all"
vA50EK70whE,307840,315360,about the neuroscience of emotions  and today we're going to talk about an extremely  important topic that central to our daily life
vA50EK70whE,315360,322080,and that's motivation.  We're going to talk about pleasure and reward.  What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward.
vA50EK70whE,322720,329360,We're going to talk about addictions.  You can't have a discussion about pleasure  and reward without having a discussion about addictions
vA50EK70whE,329360,333840,and the addictive properties of certain substances  as well as how to break free of addiction.
vA50EK70whE,334720,340560,As well we're going to talk  about the neurochemistry of drive and mindset.
vA50EK70whE,340560,347919,So all these themes are woven together  in the context of emotions.  Each one of them of course could also  be its own entire month of the podcast
vA50EK70whE,347920,353440,"and in fact, we are going to have  an entire month devoted to addiction  and I have a very special guest"
vA50EK70whE,353440,359520,that's going to be joining us  to talk about the science  and clinical practices that we know are important
vA50EK70whE,359520,364560,"for understanding and treating addiction.  But for now, let's just talk about the neuroscience"
vA50EK70whE,364560,371199,of motivation and reward of pleasure and pain  because those are central to what we think of as emotions
vA50EK70whE,371200,375919,"whether or not we feel good,  whether or not we feel we're on track in life  whether or not we feel we're falling behind."
vA50EK70whE,376640,382800,So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.  It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.
vA50EK70whE,382800,390319,"It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals  or short-term goals,  motivation and the chemistry of motivation"
vA50EK70whE,390320,395440,is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.
vA50EK70whE,395440,401600,"In fact, the same single molecule ,dopamine  is responsible for our sense of motivation"
vA50EK70whE,402160,407440,"and for movement, even though nerves controlling muscles."
vA50EK70whE,407440,413120,"So again, these are nerves in the spinal cord  or brain that move our limbs, the effector chemical"
vA50EK70whE,413120,418560,"they're the one that actually causes the muscles to  twitch to contract, is a CDOT Colleen in the brain."
vA50EK70whE,418560,424720,"Acetylcholine is responsible for focus.  However, whether or not we move,  whether or not we want to move"
vA50EK70whE,424720,430960,whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of  they could be social barriers
vA50EK70whE,430960,437920,"or financial barriers or time constraints.  That depends on this molecule.  We call dopamine, it's a fascinating molecule"
vA50EK70whE,437920,443280,and it lies at the center of so many great things in life  and it lies at the center
vA50EK70whE,443280,447840,of so many terrible aspects of life  namely addiction and certain forms of mental disease.
vA50EK70whE,448480,454240,So if ever there was a double-edged blade  in the world of neuroscience it's dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,454240,459520,So let's talk about what dopamine is  and as always we are going to talk  about actionable tools today.
vA50EK70whE,459520,464880,We're definitely gonna talk about  some things related to supplementation.  Although you might be surprised to learn
vA50EK70whE,464880,471120,"that it's not all just about increasing dopamine  and in particular, in some cases  that's the wrong thing to do."
vA50EK70whE,471120,477120,Sometimes it's appropriate sometimes it's not.  More so we're going to talk about tools related
vA50EK70whE,477120,483440,"to what's called dopamine scheduling, how  the way that you're leading your life  and the way that you're conceptualizing your goals"
vA50EK70whE,483440,488800,can actually predict whether  or not you're going to continue to pursue those goals.  And therefore whether
vA50EK70whE,488800,493360,or not you will succeed in achieving those goals  As well as whether or not you will quit.
vA50EK70whE,494000,500479,There's a fundamental relationship between  dopamine released in your brain  and your desire to exert effort.
vA50EK70whE,500480,506480,And you can actually control the schedule  of dopamine release  but it requires the appropriate knowledge.
vA50EK70whE,506480,512560,This is one of those cases where  understanding the way the dopamine system works  will allow you to leverage it to your benefit.
vA50EK70whE,512560,519760,And if you don't understand the way that dopamine works  there's a good chance that it's going  to pull you out into the current of life.
vA50EK70whE,519760,525680,Meaning the rest of the world is going  to control your dopamine schedules.  So I'm excited to tell you about today's information.
vA50EK70whE,525680,531840,You're gonna learn some basic science.  You're gonna learn a lot of tools  and these tools I believe are applicable  whether or not you're five years old
vA50EK70whE,531840,539040,"eight years old, 80 years older, anything in between.  So let's talk about dopamine.  Let's get a few basic facts on the table."
vA50EK70whE,540080,546960,"Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s  and it was discovered as the precursor, meaning the thing"
vA50EK70whE,546960,552880,from which epinephrin or adrenaline is made.  Now that's fundamentally important
vA50EK70whE,552880,558960,"because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays,  we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure,"
vA50EK70whE,559520,565200,but actually it is the substrate  from which adrenaline is made and in the brain
vA50EK70whE,565200,571920,it's the substrate from which epinephrin is  made epinephrin is the same thing as adrenaline  except in the brain we call it epinephrin.
vA50EK70whE,572640,577519,"Epinephrin as you may recall from previous podcasts,  or if you haven't no problem epinephrin"
vA50EK70whE,578320,583760,"allows us to get into action.  It stimulates changes in the blood vessels, in the heart"
vA50EK70whE,583760,590000,in the organs and tissues  of the body that bias us for movement.  And if you'd like to learn more about epinephrin
vA50EK70whE,590000,594800,you can check out our episode on mastering stress.  We talk a lot about it there.
vA50EK70whE,595440,601280,Dopamine was initially thought to be just  the building block for epinephrin.  And it is indeed the chemical building block
vA50EK70whE,601280,608320,"from which epinephrin is made.  However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.  It's not always converted to epinephrin."
vA50EK70whE,609040,615920,"Dopamine is released from several sites  in the brain and body, but perhaps the most important one  for today's discussion about motivation"
vA50EK70whE,615920,622000,and reward is something that sometimes just  called the reward pathway  for the it's sometimes called
vA50EK70whE,622000,629360,the mesolimbic reward pathway  but it's fundamentally important  to your desire to engage in action
vA50EK70whE,629920,636399,and it's fundamentally important  for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.
vA50EK70whE,636400,641680,"So how does this work?  Well, you've got a structure  in the deep part of your brain called the VTA."
vA50EK70whE,641680,648720,"It stands for ventral tegmental area.  As always you don't have to remember these names,  but if you want to I offer them to you for food"
vA50EK70whE,648720,655440,"further googling, research, reading, et cetera,  the VTA or ventral tegmental area contains neurons that"
vA50EK70whE,655440,660480,send what we call axons little wires that spit out dopamine
vA50EK70whE,660480,666400,at a different structure called the nucleus accumbens  and those two structures VTA and nucleus accumbens form
vA50EK70whE,667280,672560,really the core machinery of the reward pathway  and the pathway that controls your motivation
vA50EK70whE,672560,678640,for anything you can think of them like an accelerator  they bias you for action.
vA50EK70whE,678640,684720,"However, within the reward pathway, there's also a break  the break or restriction on that dopamine"
vA50EK70whE,684720,692000,which controls when it's released  and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex.  The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate right
vA50EK70whE,692000,697920,"behind your forehead.  It's discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience.  You hear about it for decision-making ,"
vA50EK70whE,697920,704480,"executive function ,for planning, et cetera.  And indeed it's responsible for a lot of those.  It's this really unique real estate"
vA50EK70whE,704480,711120,"that we were all endowed with as humans,  other animals don't have much of it.  We have a lot of it  and that prefrontal cortex acts"
vA50EK70whE,711120,716160,as a brake on the dopamine system  without that break you would be purely
vA50EK70whE,716160,724240,a pleasure seeking animal.  You would be purely pleasure seeking.  You would have no basis for regulating your behavior
vA50EK70whE,724240,731920,in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good.  And that brings us to the important feature of motivation
vA50EK70whE,731920,737839,which is that motivation is a two-part process  which is about balancing pleasure and pain.
vA50EK70whE,738400,744080,Okay. Most people think about motivation  and reward and dopamine is just trying to achieve pleasure.
vA50EK70whE,744080,749040,And indeed dopamine is released  in the brain from the VTA at the* nucleus accumbens.
vA50EK70whE,749840,756800,When we experience things that we like.  So here's the way to conceptualize this  and if you can internalize this in your mind
vA50EK70whE,756800,763200,it will really help you as you move through your day  trying to understand why you might be motivated  or not motivated for certain things.
vA50EK70whE,763200,769680,"So when you're just sitting around, not doing much  of anything, maybe you wake up in bed in the morning.  You're thinking about getting up or not."
vA50EK70whE,770400,776720,This reward pathway is releasing dopamine  at a rate of about three or four times per second.
vA50EK70whE,776720,783840,"It's kind of firing in a low level.  When I say firing me an electrical activity in the neurons.  So when you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed"
vA50EK70whE,783840,788000,"not highly motivated, not excited  maybe three or four times a second."
vA50EK70whE,788960,794560,"If suddenly you get excited about something  you anticipate something, not receive an award"
vA50EK70whE,794560,802080,but you get excited in an anticipatory way.  Then the rate of firing the rate of activity
vA50EK70whE,802080,809680,in this reward pathway suddenly increases  to like 30 or 40 times  and it has the effect of creating a sense
vA50EK70whE,809680,817279,"of action or desire to move  in the direction of the thing that you're craving.  In fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible"
vA50EK70whE,817280,823120,"for wanting and for craving,  and that's distinctly different  from the way that you hear it talked about normally"
vA50EK70whE,823120,828160,"which is that it's involved in pleasure.  So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex."
vA50EK70whE,828160,835200,It's released in response to food.  It's released in response to a lot of things  but it's mostly released in anticipation
vA50EK70whE,835200,841840,and craving for a particular thing.  It has the effect of narrowing our focus  for the thing that we crave
vA50EK70whE,841840,847040,and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.  It could be as important as a big board meeting.
vA50EK70whE,847040,854320,"It could be a big, final exam.  It could be a, the person that we're excited to meet  or see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving."
vA50EK70whE,854320,861199,"It just releases at a particular rate.  In fact, if we just take a step back  and we look at the scientific data"
vA50EK70whE,861200,868720,"on how much the dopamine firing increases in response  to different things, you get a pretty interesting window"
vA50EK70whE,868720,875840,"into how your brain works  and why you might be motivated or not motivated.  Let's say you're hungry, or you're looking forward"
vA50EK70whE,875840,883520,"to a cup of coffee, or you're going to see your partner.  Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate"
vA50EK70whE,883520,887760,until you start thinking about the thing that you want  or the thing that you're looking forward to
vA50EK70whE,888720,894720,"let's say you're craving chocolate  or a good meal, a steak  if you like steak or a nice plate of pasta"
vA50EK70whE,894720,899760,"if you like pasta, when you eat that food  the amount of dopamine that's released"
vA50EK70whE,899760,905839,"in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline.  The neurons there go from firing,"
vA50EK70whE,906480,912880,"three or four times per second to,  six or 10 times per second.  It really depends  and these aren't exact numbers."
vA50EK70whE,912880,918320,"But if we were to measure the amount  of dopamine that's released, it goes  up about 50 points, all right."
vA50EK70whE,919520,924640,"Sex, which is fundamental  to our species, continuation and reproduction."
vA50EK70whE,924640,929920,Although it doesn't have to be for conceiving children.  Sex does release dopamine
vA50EK70whE,929920,934240,and it increases dopamine levels about a hundred percent.  So basically doubles them.
vA50EK70whE,935360,942240,Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes  or some people are taking nicotine  in supplemental form increases the amount
vA50EK70whE,942240,950480,"of dopamine about 150% above baseline.  It also does some other things that we're gonna  talk about, but nicotine does that"
vA50EK70whE,950480,956560,"and it's kind of interesting  that nicotine would increase the amount  of dopamine in your brain very quick, within seconds"
vA50EK70whE,957520,965360,that's 150 times over baseline as opposed to sex  which is a 100 percent above or food which is 50%.
vA50EK70whE,966880,974160,Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount  of dopamine that's released a thousand fold  within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.
vA50EK70whE,974880,980560,"However, just thinking about food,  about sex, about nicotine"
vA50EK70whE,980560,986320,if you like nicotine or cocaine  or amphetamine can increase the amount  of dopamine that's released
vA50EK70whE,986320,992640,"to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.  Now it depends in some cases, for instance"
vA50EK70whE,992640,998320,"the cocaine user, the addict that wants cocaine  can't just think about cocaine and increase"
vA50EK70whE,998320,1004560,the amount of that's released about a thousand  fold is actually much lower  but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track
vA50EK70whE,1004560,1009680,"for it to crave that particular thing.  Now, there are reasons why you would  have brain circuitry like this."
vA50EK70whE,1009680,1015439,"I mean, brain circuitry  like this didn't evolve to get you addicted  brain circuitry like this evolved"
vA50EK70whE,1016240,1022400,"in order to motivate behaviors  toward particular goals,  water when you're thirsty ,  sex in order to reproduce"
vA50EK70whE,1022960,1028160,and we're gonna talk about the relationship  between estrogen and testosterone and the dopamine system  because those hormones actually
vA50EK70whE,1028160,1033679,bias dopamine to be released.  These things and these brain areas in neurons
vA50EK70whE,1033680,1038560,were part of the evolutionary history that led  to the continuation of our species.
vA50EK70whE,1039199,1045439,Things like cocaine and amphetamine are disastrous  for most people because they really so much dopamine
vA50EK70whE,1045439,1051600,"and they create these closed loops where people  then only crave the particular thing, cocaine, amphetamine"
vA50EK70whE,1051600,1057360,that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.  Most things don't release that level of dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,1057360,1064960,"Now, nowadays there's a ton  of interest in social media and in video games  and there have been some measurements"
vA50EK70whE,1064960,1070400,of the amount of dopamine released video games  especially video games have a very high update
vA50EK70whE,1070400,1075600,speed where there's novel territory all the time  not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,1075600,1081520,Those can release dopamine somewhere  between nicotine and cocaine.  So very high levels of dopamine release.
vA50EK70whE,1082560,1087600,Social media is an interesting one  because the amount of dopamine  that's released in response to logging
vA50EK70whE,1087600,1093600,onto social media initially could be quite high  but it seems like likely that there's a taper in the amount
vA50EK70whE,1093600,1099440,"of dopamine and yet people still get addicted.  So why, why is it that we can get addicted"
vA50EK70whE,1099440,1104720,to things that fail to get  to elicit the same massive amount  of pleasure that they initially did.
vA50EK70whE,1105440,1111120,Being addicted to something isn't just about  the fact that it feels so good  that you wanna do it over and over again
vA50EK70whE,1111120,1117200,and that's because of this pleasure pain balance  that underlies motivation.  So let's look a little bit closer
vA50EK70whE,1117200,1122880,at the pleasure pain balance because  there in lies the tools  for you to be able to control motivation
vA50EK70whE,1122880,1128000,toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors  towards things that are destructive for you.
vA50EK70whE,1128000,1134480,"There are a lot of reasons why  people try novel behaviors  whether or not those are drugs or  whether or not those are adventure,"
vA50EK70whE,1134480,1140160,thrill-seeking things or they seek out new partners  they take a new class as you'll notice.
vA50EK70whE,1140160,1145280,I'm not placing any judgment  or value on these different behaviors.  Although I think it's fair to point
vA50EK70whE,1145280,1152080,out that for most people addictive drugs  like cocaine and amphetamine are very destructive.
vA50EK70whE,1153200,1159280,Actually we know that about 15  to 20% of people have a genetic bias
vA50EK70whE,1159280,1164400,"towards addiction , you sometimes hear  that the first time that you use a drug"
vA50EK70whE,1164400,1171520,"you can become addicted to it.  That's actually not been shown to be true for most things  in most people, but for some people that actually is true."
vA50EK70whE,1171520,1177280,And we'll talk a little bit later about why  certain people are heavily biased toward becoming addicts
vA50EK70whE,1177280,1182640,"on the first use of a particular drug.  It's actually very interesting,  it has everything to do with whether"
vA50EK70whE,1182640,1188640,"or not they were formerly addicted to something else  but in any case, the way that addiction works"
vA50EK70whE,1189280,1194720,and the way that motivation works generally  in the non-addictive setting is  that when you anticipate something
vA50EK70whE,1194720,1199120,"a little bit of dopamine is released, and then  when you reach that thing, you're engaged in that thing"
vA50EK70whE,1200080,1205360,the amount of dopamine goes up even further  but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior
vA50EK70whE,1205360,1212880,and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing  let's say you love running  or you love chocolate as you eat a piece of chocolate
vA50EK70whE,1213440,1220240,"believe it or not, it tastes good  and then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine."
vA50EK70whE,1220240,1225600,And there are other chemicals that are released  that trigger a low level sense of pain.
vA50EK70whE,1225600,1232160,Now you might not feel it as physical pain  but the craving that you feel  is both one part dopamine
vA50EK70whE,1232160,1238480,"and one part, the mirror image of dopamine  which is the pain  or the craving for yet another piece of chocolate."
vA50EK70whE,1239040,1244240,And this is a very important  and subtle feature of the dopamine system.  That's not often discussed.
vA50EK70whE,1244240,1249520,People always talk about just as pleasure.  You love social media.  So it gives you dopamine. And so you engage in that.
vA50EK70whE,1249520,1255440,"You like chocolate, it releases dopamine.  So you do that.  But for every bit of dopamine that's released  there's another circuit"
vA50EK70whE,1255440,1262000,in the brain that creates you can think  of it as kind of like a downward deflection in pleasure.  So you engage in something you really want
vA50EK70whE,1262000,1267600,and there's an increase in pleasure.  And then without you doing anything
vA50EK70whE,1267600,1273840,there's a mirror image of that  which is a downward deflection in pleasure  which we're calling pain.  So for every bit of pleasure
vA50EK70whE,1273840,1279040,there is a mirror image experience  of pain and they overlap in time very closely.
vA50EK70whE,1279040,1285200,"So it's sometimes hard to sense this  but try it the next time you eat something really delicious.  You'll take a bite,  it tastes delicious"
vA50EK70whE,1285200,1290880,and part of the experience is to want more of that thing.  This is true for any pleasureful experience.
vA50EK70whE,1291840,1298080,"Now, the diabolical part about dopamine is that  because it didn't evolve in order to get you to indulge"
vA50EK70whE,1298080,1307280,"in more and more and more of something, what happens is  that initially you experience an increase in pleasure"
vA50EK70whE,1307280,1314960,and you also experience this increase  in pain shortly after or woven in  with the pleasure that makes you want more of that thing.
vA50EK70whE,1314960,1321280,"But with each subsequent time  that you encounter that thing  that you pursue, the chocolate that"
vA50EK70whE,1321280,1326400,"you pursue the lover each time, the experience"
vA50EK70whE,1326400,1332480,of dopamine release and pleasure is diminished a little bit.  And the diabolical thing is
vA50EK70whE,1332480,1338000,that the pain response is increased a little bit  and this is best observed
vA50EK70whE,1338000,1345280,"in the context of drug seeking behavior.  The first time someone decides to take cocaine  or amphetamine, they may do it out of boredom."
vA50EK70whE,1345280,1351120,"They may do it out of peer pressure.  They may do it to relieve some internal sense.  Maybe they're bored, or they're just excited."
vA50EK70whE,1351120,1357120,Maybe they're high in novel novelty seeking.  There are a lot of reasons why people  might try a drug far too many for us
vA50EK70whE,1357120,1362240,to get into our parks here.  Maybe they don't even wanna do it  but someone encourages them.
vA50EK70whE,1362240,1366800,They will experience a huge dopamine release  and they will feel likely very good.
vA50EK70whE,1367760,1372880,"However, the next time they take it  it won't feel quite as good.  And it won't feel even as good the third time"
vA50EK70whE,1372880,1379200,"or the next time, but the amount of pain  the amount of craving that they experience"
vA50EK70whE,1379200,1386480,for the drug will increase over time.  So much of our pursuit of pleasure  is simply to reduce the pain of craving.
vA50EK70whE,1386480,1393280,"So the next time you experienced something,  you really like I don't wanna  take you out of that experience  but it's really important that you notice this"
vA50EK70whE,1393280,1400880,that if there's something you really enjoy  part of that enjoyment is  about the anticipation and wanting of more of that thing
vA50EK70whE,1401600,1408160,and that's the pain system in action.  And so we can distinguish between dopamine  which is really about pleasure and dopamine
vA50EK70whE,1408160,1414720,which is really about motivation to pursue more  in order to relieve or exclude future pain.
vA50EK70whE,1414720,1422240,"Let me repeat that.  Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure, as much  as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more"
vA50EK70whE,1422240,1427600,in order to reduce the amount of pain  and we are now talking about pain
vA50EK70whE,1427600,1433120,as a psychological pain and a craving  although people that miss a lover very badly
vA50EK70whE,1433680,1440880,"or that really crave a food very badly,  or that are addicted to a drug and can't access,"
vA50EK70whE,1440880,1446080,it will experience that as a physical craving  and a mental craving the body and brain
vA50EK70whE,1446080,1453520,"are linked in this way.  It's almost, they'll describe it as painful.  They yearn for it.  And I think the word yearning is one that's very valuable"
vA50EK70whE,1453520,1459360,"in this context, because yearning seems to  include a whole body experience more than just wanting"
vA50EK70whE,1459360,1465200,which could just be up in the mind.  So your desire for something is proportional
vA50EK70whE,1465200,1471280,to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing  but also how much pain you experience when
vA50EK70whE,1471280,1476880,you don't have it.  And you can now start to let your mind wander  into all sorts of examples of addictions
vA50EK70whE,1476880,1482399,"or things that you happen to like,  I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here  which is my love of croissants."
vA50EK70whE,1482400,1488720,Although several of you pointed out  these are called croissant  but then it sounds like I'm trying to speak French  and I always tried to do that when I was a kid
vA50EK70whE,1488720,1494480,and I went to a bilingual school and it failed  then it's gonna fail now.  So I'm gonna call them croissants.  They're delicious.
vA50EK70whE,1494480,1501600,"I love them a really good one makes me wanna eat six.  It's true.  I have pretty good impulse control, I think"
vA50EK70whE,1501600,1510080,but it makes me wanna eat six.  I taste it and it tastes so delicious  and unless I really force myself to experience
vA50EK70whE,1510080,1516400,the taste of it in my mouth  and how flaky I'm getting hungry for it right now  and delicious the croissant is mostly the tastes
vA50EK70whE,1516400,1522559,"of that croissant makes me want to eat more croissants.  Now, eventually blood sugar goes up  satiety is reached, et cetera."
vA50EK70whE,1522560,1527760,"What happens then?  What is satisfaction and satiety about?  Well, that's a separate neuromodulator."
vA50EK70whE,1527760,1534800,That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.  It's about oxytocin.  It's about a hormone system that involves something
vA50EK70whE,1534800,1540400,"called prolactin.  So we're gonna talk about  all of those in the book  ""the Molecule of More"" wonderful book"
vA50EK70whE,1541760,1546960,those were described as the here and now molecules  the ones that allow you to experience your sensations
vA50EK70whE,1546960,1553200,and pleasure in the present  and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.  So now let's talk about craving
vA50EK70whE,1553840,1560480,and these so-called here and now molecules  and how those engage in a kind  of push pull balance that will allow you to not
vA50EK70whE,1560480,1566799,"just feel more motivated, but also to enjoy the things  in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree."
vA50EK70whE,1567520,1575039,We have neurons in an area  of our brain called the raphe R-A-P-H-E  The raphe releases serotonin
vA50EK70whE,1575040,1582240,at different places in the brain.  Serotonin is the molecule of bliss  and contentment for what you already have.
vA50EK70whE,1583280,1588320,"I've talked before about exteroception,  exteroception is a focus on the outside world,"
vA50EK70whE,1588320,1594720,everything beyond the confines of your skin.  I've also talked about interoception of focus  on things that are happening internally
vA50EK70whE,1594720,1602240,within the confines of your skin.  Dopamine and serotonin can be thought
vA50EK70whE,1602240,1607440,of as related to extra reception.  Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us
vA50EK70whE,1607440,1614800,that are beyond what we call our personal space  where we actually have to move  and take action in order to achieve things
vA50EK70whE,1614800,1620000,"and serotonin in general has to do with  the things that are in our immediate here and now,  hence the description"
vA50EK70whE,1620000,1626400,of these as the here and now molecules.  So it's interesting to point out that the body
vA50EK70whE,1626400,1632320,and the brain can direct its attention  towards things outside us or inside us  or split our attention between those.
vA50EK70whE,1632320,1638480,"I talked about this in a previous podcast  but if you didn't see it, no problem.  Just understand that dopamine biases us"
vA50EK70whE,1638480,1646000,"toward thinking about what we don't have,  whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules  like the endocannabinoids if you picked up on"
vA50EK70whE,1646000,1651679,"the word cannabinoid, yes it's like cannabis  because cannabis attaches to endocannabinoids receptors"
vA50EK70whE,1652240,1659360,and the endocannabinoids are receptors that  and chemicals that the cannabinoids that you  naturally make that are involved in things like forgetting.
vA50EK70whE,1659920,1665360,It's not a coincidence  that pot smokers don't have the most terrific memory.  You may know a few that have great memories
vA50EK70whE,1665360,1672080,"but chances are, they would have even better memories  if they weren't pot smokers  but you make these molecules that bind"
vA50EK70whE,1672080,1678640,to these receptors that make you feel kinda blissed  out and content in the present.  Those are receptors that exist in us
vA50EK70whE,1678640,1687120,"not for sake of consuming THC or marijuana, but  for sake of binding of our natural endogenous cannabinoids."
vA50EK70whE,1687120,1693120,So you've got these two systems  they're kind of like a push pull  and if you were to say in the book
vA50EK70whE,1693120,1699360,or wherever you go there you are Jon Kabat-Zinn talks  about this meditation practice.  That's different than most meditation practices
vA50EK70whE,1699360,1705680,"where you eat one almond  and you focus all of your attention on the almond  the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond."
vA50EK70whE,1706240,1711280,That's really a mindfulness practice  that's geared towards trying to take a behavior
vA50EK70whE,1711280,1717920,"which is normally about pursuit, normally feeding  as we were going to engage in feeding because of dopamine"
vA50EK70whE,1717920,1723840,we pursue more of a food  because of that pleasure pain relationship  I talked about before the focus on the one almond
vA50EK70whE,1723840,1731280,or becoming very present  in any behavior that normally would be a kind  of extra susceptive pursuit behavior
vA50EK70whE,1731280,1737919,and bring it into the here  and now that's a mental trick or a mental task
vA50EK70whE,1737920,1744400,that the mindfulness community has really embraced  in order to try  and create increased pleasure for what you already have.
vA50EK70whE,1744400,1749600,It's really trying to accomplish a shift  from dopamine being released to serotonin
vA50EK70whE,1749600,1755279,"in the cannabinoid system, being involved in that behavior.  So if you're interested in mindfulness"
vA50EK70whE,1755280,1762320,which is something I've talked about before in this podcast  and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes  about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness.
vA50EK70whE,1762320,1769520,Mindfulness is a vast space  that is a mindful practice that a lot  of people have engaged in.  And indeed it can give you deeper appreciation
vA50EK70whE,1769520,1775760,for things that you already have.  Dopamine has the quality  of making people kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.
vA50EK70whE,1775760,1784960,"Look at people who are high  on cocaine or amphetamine, and they are almost  entirely extra receptive drugs like marijuana, the opioids"
vA50EK70whE,1785680,1792000,anything that really hits the serotonin system hard  tend to make people rather lethargic
vA50EK70whE,1792000,1800240,and content to stay exactly where they are.  They don't wanna pursue much at all.  Occasionally when people smoke marijuana or consume THC
vA50EK70whE,1800240,1806159,their appetite goes way up  and they really wanna consume food.  That's because of its effects on insulin and its effects
vA50EK70whE,1806160,1814080,"on blood sugar, which is a slightly separate matter.  But since some of you, probably your minds  might've gone to those either experiences"
vA50EK70whE,1814080,1819600,"or reports of what pot does, that's why it does that.  So you've got these molecules"
vA50EK70whE,1819600,1825440,like dopamine that make you focused  on the things you want and the things you crave.  And then you've got the molecules that make you content
vA50EK70whE,1825440,1831680,"with what you have.  So the most important thing, perhaps in creating a healthy"
vA50EK70whE,1831680,1838159,emotional landscape is to have a balance  between these two neuromodulator systems  people that are always in anticipation
vA50EK70whE,1838160,1845040,"and desire and seeking that's wonderful for pursuing goals.  However, it's terrible for enjoying life"
vA50EK70whE,1845040,1850240,"and actually those people are actually quite  difficult to be around.  There's a certain, almost sociopathic element"
vA50EK70whE,1850240,1855280,to people who are what they call hyper dopaminergic.  People who are always on the dopaminergic scale
vA50EK70whE,1856000,1860720,"to the point where they are always pursuing goals.  In fact, those people are known to be"
vA50EK70whE,1861440,1868640,at least in the psychological spectrum.  They can be very manipulative dopamine  and the pursuit of something doesn't necessarily
vA50EK70whE,1868640,1876160,"have to be high energy and intense from the outside.  When you observe it from the outside.  In fact, there are people who will manipulate"
vA50EK70whE,1876160,1882480,"in order to get what they want.  This has been shown who have high levels of dopamine release  in their brain, but they've learned that a kind"
vA50EK70whE,1882480,1888480,of passive manipulation is the best way to maneuver  through a particular environment.  I don't wanna focus too much
vA50EK70whE,1888480,1896800,on sociopathy because those are kind of extreme examples  but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal
vA50EK70whE,1897360,1903920,and realize the series of steps that they need to take  in order to achieve that goal can either do it  through ethical means or non ethical means they can do it
vA50EK70whE,1903920,1910000,"through active pursuit, being the kind  of type a person that's always declaring their goals  and going after it, posting it on Instagram"
vA50EK70whE,1910000,1914159,"telling everybody about it, try and recruit others.  There's that phenotype"
vA50EK70whE,1915360,1920960,"there's that kind of signature of dopamine  and then there are the people that wanna  get what they want, and they're doing it"
vA50EK70whE,1920960,1926960,by always serving other people  by always taking care of everybody else's needs  by always trying to accomplish their goals
vA50EK70whE,1926960,1933600,but through a mode that at least  from the outside seems more passive  or more about supporting others.
vA50EK70whE,1933600,1940320,Neither of these are good or bad.  And that's because dopamine is a molecule.  It doesn't care how you reach your goals.
vA50EK70whE,1940320,1946960,It only cares that you reach your goals  because the internal sensation is one again of mild pleasure
vA50EK70whE,1947600,1955600,"a little bit of pain, although more pain over time.  If you're not reaching those goals  and it takes you away from the here and now."
vA50EK70whE,1956240,1961680,"So at about this point in the podcast  I'm guessing that some you are thinking, okay, great.  I want more dopamine."
vA50EK70whE,1961680,1967600,I want to be more motivated.  I don't wanna procrastinate as much  and I want to be able to experience life.
vA50EK70whE,1967600,1976880,"I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.  Well, there is a way to do that, but you have to  understand the source of procrastination is not one thing."
vA50EK70whE,1976880,1983360,There are basically two kinds  of procrastinators or so says the research.  The first kind are people that actually really
vA50EK70whE,1983360,1989440,enjoy the stress of the impending deadline.  It's the only way they can get into action.
vA50EK70whE,1989440,1996720,These are people that really like the feeling of  something being due in an hour and how activated
vA50EK70whE,1996720,2002640,and sharp and focused that makes them feel.  Those people are people that are tapping
vA50EK70whE,2002640,2009759,"into the epinephrin system, the stress system  and for which the stress really tightens  their ability to see it creates that"
vA50EK70whE,2009760,2015600,soda straw view of the world.  It creates an action element  in the body that makes them feel like they wanna move.
vA50EK70whE,2015600,2022240,It really eliminates all the distractions for them.  So they're actually leveraging stress internal stress
vA50EK70whE,2022880,2028480,in order to achieve a state that they can't  seem to otherwise achieve.  I won't tell you what to do
vA50EK70whE,2028480,2036000,"in order to overcome all kinds of procrastination  but from a logical perspective, it makes sense  therefore, for those kinds of people to think"
vA50EK70whE,2036000,2043120,"about other ways that they can get their system  into activation, I've talked  about this in previous podcasts  but a couple of those tools might be the"
vA50EK70whE,2043120,2050960,what we called super oxygenation breathing  which I admit is not always super oxygenating.  So this would be if didn't want it to consume anything.
vA50EK70whE,2050960,2056000,This could be 25 or 30 cycles of  in deep inhales and exhales.
vA50EK70whE,2056000,2061520,It's likely to create some anxiety and a low level stress.  If you're someone who's prone to panic attacks
vA50EK70whE,2061520,2068879,"I wouldn't recommend this, but it's pretty straight forward.  It will deploy adrenaline into your system.  And you will find that your visual field is focused"
vA50EK70whE,2068879,2076080,and you will be able to work  and focus better than if you just kinda waited around  for some wave of motivation to wash over you.
vA50EK70whE,2077040,2083760,Normally you're waiting  for that deadline to come into sight  and then that's what the stimulus is.  But you can self-direct adrenaline release
vA50EK70whE,2083760,2090480,"without ingesting anything.  You can also ingest coffee, caffeine  or Mate or something like that, which is what"
vA50EK70whE,2090480,2096640,"I prefer very often to coffee, which has caffeine.  Caffeine does release dopamine at low levels"
vA50EK70whE,2097200,2102320,how much it releases dopamine it isn't clear.  It seems to increase firing in these neurons
vA50EK70whE,2102320,2107680,"in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%  which is a pretty low level,  but it can create agitation so for"
vA50EK70whE,2107680,2112960,"caffeine sensitive people, that could be a problem.  I've talked before about things"
vA50EK70whE,2112960,2118080,like L tyrosine the precursor to dopamine or Mucuna Purina.  I talked about that in the last episode
vA50EK70whE,2118080,2124800,"but if you didn't see that, just to remind you  L tyrosine is present in red meats,  it's in certain nuts and L tyrosine"
vA50EK70whE,2124800,2131119,"is the precursor to dopamine.  You can supplement L tyrosine.  If you like, you will get a big inflection in dopamine"
vA50EK70whE,2131120,2136080,"but there is a crash associated with it.  However, it will increase motivation in the short term"
vA50EK70whE,2136800,2141920,not suggesting anyone do this.  I wanna be very clear to say what I always say.  I'm not a doctor.  I don't prescribe anything.
vA50EK70whE,2141920,2148560,I'm a professor.  I profess things.  You have to know whether or not these things are appropriate  for your mental and physical health or not.
vA50EK70whE,2148560,2155520,"So you need to consult a doctor.  For instance, people who suffer from schizotypal  or schizophrenia or mania should probably not"
vA50EK70whE,2155520,2161840,"be taking supplements that increase their dopamine levels.  Now, if you can't increase your level"
vA50EK70whE,2161840,2168559,of focus and your level of alertness  and your level of motivation using breathing well  then there might be something else at play.
vA50EK70whE,2168560,2174960,There are other procrastinators  for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine.  They're not making enough dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,2174960,2180480,And for those people  there are a variety of things that can increase dopamine.  I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist
vA50EK70whE,2180480,2188000,"or doctor I've talked about Mucuna Purina,  which is 99.9%. L-DOPA the precursor to dopamine."
vA50EK70whE,2188000,2193839,So there are people that do much better when  they take things that increase their dopamine levels.
vA50EK70whE,2194720,2201119,There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin Pru prior own  which increase is the other name for it
vA50EK70whE,2201120,2208000,"which increased dopamine and epinephrin,  it can increase risk of epileptic attacks  if you're epileptic.  So again, you have to talk to your doctor"
vA50EK70whE,2208000,2213840,"but they will increase dopamine and motivation and focus.  However, if you think back"
vA50EK70whE,2213840,2222079,"to our earlier discussion about dopamine, dopamine  if it's very high, creates a sense of pleasure"
vA50EK70whE,2222080,2228720,"and the desire for more,  so you can also become a person  for which enough is never enough."
vA50EK70whE,2228720,2235040,"The only thing that dopamine really wants is more  of the thing that releases dopamine  and so big inflections in dopamine,"
vA50EK70whE,2235040,2241440,"whether or not they come from cocaine  or whether or not they come from a supplementation,  caffeine exercise study regime"
vA50EK70whE,2241440,2246720,will just make you want more of something  and we've all heard before of growth mindset
vA50EK70whE,2246720,2252800,"this incredible discovery of my colleague,  Carol Dweck where some of these positive mindsets  that the psychology community has put forth"
vA50EK70whE,2252800,2258800,as really good for pursuit of goals  and pursuit of things that require long bouts of effort.
vA50EK70whE,2258800,2264160,"Well, it's wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine  to that process psychologically, but"
vA50EK70whE,2264160,2272000,if you're starting to augment the amount  of dopamine increase the amount  of dopamine through things like supplementation  and prescription drugs what's gonna happen is
vA50EK70whE,2272000,2278160,you're not only gonna need to pursue more  and more of the sorts of things  that are associated with the dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,2278160,2283520,"So more doing more studying, more sport  more pursuit, higher mountains, more money,"
vA50EK70whE,2283520,2289200,"more whatever but we know that over time,  the mirror image of that"
vA50EK70whE,2289200,2294240,the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase.  This is the pleasure pain relationship
vA50EK70whE,2294240,2300960,"that we talked about earlier.  So in a few moments, I'm gonna talk  about how to think about healthy dopamine schedules"
vA50EK70whE,2300960,2306280,but I just wanna take a step back for a second  and talk a little bit about the flip side of Dolby
vA50EK70whE,2306280,2312160,"and what happens after this so-called dopamine crash  what mechanisms are installed in us,"
vA50EK70whE,2312160,2317440,"because believe it or not,  there are mechanisms that are installed  in all of us that really put the complete"
vA50EK70whE,2317440,2323440,"and total break on dopamine, why they're there  and what they do because you've experienced these before"
vA50EK70whE,2323440,2329200,and there are actually ways that you can navigate them.  These dopamine crashes are these intentional
vA50EK70whE,2329200,2334240,dopamine suppression mechanisms  in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules
vA50EK70whE,2334240,2343040,and to feel more motivated.  Perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms  in all humans is the neuro circuitry designed
vA50EK70whE,2343040,2352480,for seeking out mates and for reproduction  and that's because the continuation  of any one species is the primary driver for any species.
vA50EK70whE,2352480,2357760,"That's just the reality.  Now I'm removing all context here.  So whatever I say, of course, it's"
vA50EK70whE,2359280,2365680,"on a backdrop of consensual age  appropriate species, appropriate context,"
vA50EK70whE,2365680,2371680,"appropriate all of that.  This is not about the sociology of reproduction and sex.  This is about the biology,"
vA50EK70whE,2371680,2377520,the biology of sex in males and females  doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome X
vA50EK70whE,2377520,2384000,"Y chromosome X, X, Y X, Y Y doesn't matter.  The reality is that dopamine is released"
vA50EK70whE,2384000,2392960,"on anticipation and consummation of sex and reproduction.  And after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background"
vA50EK70whE,2393680,2400000,there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine  and an increase in a hormone called prolactin.
vA50EK70whE,2400000,2405200,"Now, prolactin is associated  with milk let-down in lactating mothers."
vA50EK70whE,2405200,2412799,It's also present in males and in general  prolactin creates a sense of lethargy of stillness
vA50EK70whE,2412800,2418800,and lack of desire to move  and lack of desire to pursue more  of whatever released the dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,2418800,2424240,"Prolactin in fact, sets the refractory period  on a male's ability to mate again"
vA50EK70whE,2425040,2431200,"now this is gonna vary tremendously  from individual to individual.  It also can, there are data showing"
vA50EK70whE,2431200,2439040,that it can vary tremendously  from mate pairing to mate pairing the number  one thing that releases dopamine is novelty
vA50EK70whE,2439040,2444720,and it is true that the refractory period is shortened  by the introduction of novel mates.
vA50EK70whE,2444720,2450320,This was first shown in a kind  of classic experiment in of all things in chickens.
vA50EK70whE,2450320,2456000,"This is called the Coolidge effect  and the story is the story goes  and I believe it's a true story,"
vA50EK70whE,2456000,2462080,it's actually in all the neuroendocrinology textbooks.  So I believe it's true is  that president Calvin Coolidge
vA50EK70whE,2462080,2469280,was visiting a chicken farm.  They were is being taken around and the person who was
vA50EK70whE,2469280,2475920,hosting the visit showed them  a rooster that was Coolidge and his wife  were on the visit and said
vA50EK70whE,2475920,2482480,"""this rooster copulates thousands of times per day.""  And Mrs. Coolidge apparently"
vA50EK70whE,2482480,2491039,"kind of elbowed president Coolidge  and said, ""ah, you hear that"" kind of like pointing  out the prowess of this rooster and Coolidge said,"" yeah"
vA50EK70whE,2491040,2496319,"but let me ask you a question,  same hen or different hens.""  It turns out it was different hens."
vA50EK70whE,2496320,2503920,And the reason is the introduction  of a novel mate increases dopamine levels.  And what's interesting about this is that
vA50EK70whE,2503920,2511200,after copulation prolactin goes through the roof  and prevents further copulation dopamine crashes
vA50EK70whE,2511840,2519040,but the introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this.  Now this is not a ploy for people
vA50EK70whE,2519040,2524400,to change mates often what this  is a story about the dopamine and prolactin system
vA50EK70whE,2524400,2531120,"that also exists in humans.  Now, there are actually things that people  in certain communities take"
vA50EK70whE,2531120,2536400,in order to bypass these refractory periods.  There's actually drugs that increase dopamine
vA50EK70whE,2536400,2541040,suppress prolactin and vice versa.  There's actually another way to suppress prolactin.
vA50EK70whE,2541680,2548160,Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent prolactin inhibitor as a zinc.
vA50EK70whE,2548160,2555279,And if you look out there  in the literature and for those either  in the wellness and cost sports performance community  a lot of the so-called quote unquote testosterone
vA50EK70whE,2555280,2562319,boosters are actually combinations of vitamin B6  and zinc which inhibit prolactin
vA50EK70whE,2562320,2569840,and by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine.  So they do have some functional effect in that regard.
vA50EK70whE,2569840,2577279,They're not really increasing testosterone directly  they're suppressing prolactin levels.  And there are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia
vA50EK70whE,2577280,2582800,"which leads to massive decreases in libido, et cetera.  And there are prescription drugs to"
vA50EK70whE,2582800,2589680,"treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course  you should always talk to an endocrinologist  about those sorts of prescription drugs."
vA50EK70whE,2589680,2595440,"So it's interesting that this very basic mechanism  of dopamine and prolactin, this sort of motivation,"
vA50EK70whE,2595440,2601760,"no more motivation is a system that evolved  for reproduction first, but that actually takes place."
vA50EK70whE,2601760,2610000,"And you can see in elsewhere in the world, for instance  schizophrenia disease that has many different types"
vA50EK70whE,2610000,2616240,"and facets, but schizophrenia is a case of an often  of hyperactivation of the dopamine system"
vA50EK70whE,2616960,2625600,"so much so that it can make people feel kind of high,  they hallucinate, I mean, we're talking very  very high or dysregulated dopamine circuits in the brain."
vA50EK70whE,2626160,2632160,One of the treatments for schizophrenia  are drugs that block dopamine receptors.
vA50EK70whE,2633360,2638960,"And if you have the it's unfortunate,  there are so many people that are out  on the street these days who have schizophrenia,"
vA50EK70whE,2638960,2644880,"some of whom are taking their meds,  some of who, whom aren't  if you ever see somebody on the street that's doing what's"
vA50EK70whE,2644880,2653440,it's like a lip smacking and writhing  it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.  This is a movement disorder that's created
vA50EK70whE,2653440,2658800,by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs.  So you can imagine these anti-doping synergic drugs
vA50EK70whE,2658800,2665600,while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations  they create these movement problems  because of dopamines importance
vA50EK70whE,2665600,2671760,"for the movement circuitry so-called pyramidal circuitry  for the aficionados.  In addition, you sometimes see"
vA50EK70whE,2671760,2677840,"in males that take these drugs, drugs  like haloperidol and the other dopamine blockers"
vA50EK70whE,2677840,2683599,that they actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia.  So the development of male breast tissue is
vA50EK70whE,2683600,2691680,"because of the elevated levels of prolactin  because they're suppressing their dopamine so much.  Now that's a really extreme case, but maybe perhaps"
vA50EK70whE,2692720,2699920,if you see somebody engaging these very strange kind  of face riding and body riding behaviors  that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness.
vA50EK70whE,2699920,2706880,That's a consequence most often of the drugs  that they're taking to treat the mental illness.  Those are side effects of those drugs.
vA50EK70whE,2706880,2712240,"Now prolactin is increased any time.  We have some really heightened, intense experience."
vA50EK70whE,2712240,2719120,"It's not just released after sex and reproduction.  Prolactin is released after some major event,"
vA50EK70whE,2719120,2724240,it's actually responsible  thought for some of postpartum depression
vA50EK70whE,2724240,2731120,"for different types of kind of the, the let down the low.  I can distinctly remember that after finals or"
vA50EK70whE,2731120,2736799,"after publishing a big paper, I would be very, very happy  but then I'd find that, Oh, you know"
vA50EK70whE,2736800,2742480,"like what next or things might seem a little bit dimmed  or dulled out for the next day or so, or the following week."
vA50EK70whE,2742480,2748640,The timescales on these are gonna vary  because some people release a lot of dopamine  for a very long time in response to something great
vA50EK70whE,2748640,2755360,and other people have a quick inflection  of dopamine and then they're back to feeling not so great.  It really varies from person to person.
vA50EK70whE,2755360,2760800,"In fact, long ago, I started  as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry  and the relationship would be"
vA50EK70whE,2760800,2766960,"between dopamine and prolactin.  I started to leverage this, believe it or not.  After some major event"
vA50EK70whE,2766960,2773920,I would take a couple 100 milligrams of vitamin B6.  I think for people who have diabetic neuropathy
vA50EK70whE,2773920,2779440,"you need to be careful  with vitamin B6 check with your doctor.  I was told, although I haven't found the literature"
vA50EK70whE,2779440,2788160,"on this that it can, in some cases  exacerbate peripheral neuropathy, but  for most people it's thought to be reasonably safe"
vA50EK70whE,2788160,2794080,"but again, always check with your physician  but I would take some B6 to kind of offset some of that low."
vA50EK70whE,2794080,2799599,"And I actually, I don't know if it was subjective or not  but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect."
vA50EK70whE,2800160,2807120,I also started just internalizing the fact  that dopamine is so subjective.  There are objective aspects to dopamine
vA50EK70whE,2807120,2813440,and how much is released  but there's also some subjective effects to dopamine.  And so one of the things that you can do
vA50EK70whE,2813440,2818560,in order to generally just be a happier person  especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals
vA50EK70whE,2818560,2825680,of any kind is the longer that you can extend  that positive phase of the dopamine release.
vA50EK70whE,2825680,2831360,"And the more that you can blunt the pain response to that  the better, and you can actually do this cognitively."
vA50EK70whE,2831360,2836720,"I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper  I would get really excited, but I wouldn't"
vA50EK70whE,2836720,2844319,allow myself to get too excited what I wanted to do instead  and what I've still tried to do is try  and extend the arc of that positive experience
vA50EK70whE,2844320,2851359,"as long as I possibly can simply  by thinking back like, Oh, that was really cool.  I really enjoy doing that work.  I really enjoyed the discovery."
vA50EK70whE,2851360,2856880,"I really enjoy doing that with the people  that I was working with at the time,  what a pleasure that was."
vA50EK70whE,2856880,2862800,"I can get this very easily  from pictures of people, in things like Costello  that I really enjoy trips that I've taken."
vA50EK70whE,2862800,2870720,So you can extend pleasure  without having to engage in the behavior over and over.  That's extending the arc of that dopamine release as well.
vA50EK70whE,2870720,2876000,It offset some of the pain  of not having that experience occur over
vA50EK70whE,2876000,2882240,and over and over again.  Now for the high performers out there  you're probably familiar  with this many people who have a big achievement.
vA50EK70whE,2882240,2888880,"Their first thoughts are will now, what  what am I gonna do next?  How am I ever gonna exceed that?  And indeed many people who are very high"
vA50EK70whE,2888880,2895520,on this kind of dopamine sensation  and novelty seeking scale are prone to addiction.  They're prone to the rabid pursuit
vA50EK70whE,2895520,2900720,of external goals of external perception to the neglect  of these internal mechanisms that allow them to
vA50EK70whE,2900720,2904880,"feel calm and happy.  So for people that are very driven, very motivated"
vA50EK70whE,2906240,2911840,adopting a practice of being able to engage  in the here and now the sort  of almond type practices we talked about earlier
vA50EK70whE,2913120,2918960,of learning how to achieve a really good night's sleep  on a regular basis through tools and mechanisms I talked
vA50EK70whE,2918960,2925120,about in previous podcasts gives us sort  of balance to the pleasure seeking for an offsetting
vA50EK70whE,2925120,2931520,of pain and the pleasure in the here and now.  So pleasure is really two things.  It's a joy in pursuit
vA50EK70whE,2932400,2939520,but it's also the joy in what you have.  And there's a beautiful model  of emotional development that was developed
vA50EK70whE,2939520,2944720,by Alan shore professor at UCLA  and psychiatrist that talks about some of the basics
vA50EK70whE,2944720,2951760,of good infant parent attachment  where good parenting that leads  to healthy adult relationships
vA50EK70whE,2951760,2959280,and emotion regulation tends to include both sides  of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.
vA50EK70whE,2959280,2964800,"We talk about the relationship between child  and parent typically was the mother, but also father"
vA50EK70whE,2964800,2971200,where you can get the child really excited  by kind of squealing and ramping them  up or talking about something or ice cream or play.
vA50EK70whE,2971200,2977120,"And the kid gets very excited.  That's the dopaminergic system  the anticipation of something that's coming, but as well"
vA50EK70whE,2977680,2983520,"engaging with children in a way that's really  about everything that you have right  in the here and now, the reading of the book"
vA50EK70whE,2983520,2988880,the kids always seem to ask one more time.  One more.  They seem to want more of the things that they enjoy
vA50EK70whE,2988880,2993920,but really engaging with them  in a way that increases their sense of pleasure
vA50EK70whE,2993920,2999680,"for what's right there, as well as giving them a lot  of things to be excited about and positive anticipation."
vA50EK70whE,3000240,3006800,"Now, having worked years ago with at-risk kids and also  with young kids at summer camps and things like that"
vA50EK70whE,3006800,3013360,"one of the things that you learn is you never say maybe  to a kid about a reward.  If you say, we might have ice cream later"
vA50EK70whE,3013360,3019760,you are essentially saying we are having ice cream.  They don't hear the maybe part  and it turns out adults don't either.
vA50EK70whE,3019760,3026559,It's really interesting.  There's something called reward prediction error.  I've talked about this before  but I haven't really talked about it deeply in the context
vA50EK70whE,3026560,3032000,"of the dopamine system, dopamine, as I've said,  is involved in anticipation of wanting,"
vA50EK70whE,3032000,3038000,not of having it's involved  in motivation toward the thing that you want.  And it biases us towards action.
vA50EK70whE,3039280,3047440,"Reward prediction, error equals the actual amount  of dopamine that's released in response  to something versus minus the amount that's expected."
vA50EK70whE,3047440,3054400,"Okay. So if you tell a kid, we might have ice cream  they hear we're gonna have ice cream and they expect it."
vA50EK70whE,3054400,3060560,"And if you later say, well  we're not gonna have ice cream  and I said, maybe that's actually gonna lead"
vA50EK70whE,3060560,3066240,"to a much bigger crash in dopamine.  It's going to lead to a negative signal,"
vA50EK70whE,3066240,3071040,"a punishment signal.  It's literally going to feel like pain.  So kids, you can leverage this."
vA50EK70whE,3072160,3078079,If your parents say  maybe they're effectively telling your dopamine system  absolutely. Now adults are like this too.
vA50EK70whE,3078080,3083520,"If we think something might happen and it doesn't happen  there's a big crash in our aspect,"
vA50EK70whE,3083520,3089440,in our emotionality and that's because  that dopamine system goes from firing  about three to four times per second
vA50EK70whE,3089440,3094560,to about 10 or 15 times per second  in the possibility that something might happen
vA50EK70whE,3094560,3100000,"possibility is deeply woven into our biology  of the dopamine and motivation system,"
vA50EK70whE,3100000,3106800,as a way for us presumably in ancient times  to explore novel territories  and get a sense that maybe there's water there.
vA50EK70whE,3106800,3113040,Maybe there are mates there.  Maybe there's better food there  maybe there's resources there.  The maybe is important thing
vA50EK70whE,3113040,3121040,"that in language terms maybe means maybe, but  in neuro-biological terms maybe means perhaps"
vA50EK70whE,3121040,3126560,there's going to be the surprise  of an even bigger dopamine reward.  And the one thing dopamine loves more
vA50EK70whE,3126560,3132000,"than anything else is surprise.  When we get something positive, we go to the mailbox"
vA50EK70whE,3132000,3137840,we're expecting some bills and you open it  up and you get a letter  from somebody you haven't thought about in a long time.  And you adore that person.
vA50EK70whE,3138400,3143840,That's a huge dopamine release.  It actually triggers neuroplasticity.  You probably never forget that
vA50EK70whE,3143840,3148960,"because of the way that dopamine Gates' plasticity.  When we get an, a surprise"
vA50EK70whE,3148960,3154480,"of something that we didn't want,  also it creates plasticity."
vA50EK70whE,3154480,3161360,"So the surprise, novelty, motivation, and reward  they're all woven into this package that we call dopamine."
vA50EK70whE,3161360,3168720,And the cool thing is you can actually  regulate this whole system in a way that will steer you
vA50EK70whE,3168720,3174400,or lean you towards more positive anticipation  of things in life and less disappointment.  It's simply a matter
vA50EK70whE,3174400,3179840,"of adjusting what we call the dopamine schedule.  Okay. A couple things before we continue,"
vA50EK70whE,3179840,3185599,"we're gonna talk about attention deficit in a few minutes.  But before that, I wanna talk  about something that I've mentioned before"
vA50EK70whE,3185600,3193600,"in previous podcasts, but that you may not be aware of  and if you're aware of you may still be doing,"
vA50EK70whE,3193600,3201040,which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine  it's creating a sense of disappointment in ways
vA50EK70whE,3201040,3208319,that are most likely hurting you mentally and physically.  And that's the blunting of dopamine
vA50EK70whE,3208320,3214319,"by viewing light in the middle of the night  I realized this is not a discussion about sleep  and circadian rhythms, but the data now are so"
vA50EK70whE,3214320,3222480,strong showing that viewing bright light  from about 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM too often triggers activation
vA50EK70whE,3222480,3230160,of this circuit called the habenula  So this is eye to  It goes from your retina  to a structure called the habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A
vA50EK70whE,3230960,3239440,"Then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry  and it suppresses the activation of the reward.  Circuitry, not just in that moment, but to things"
vA50EK70whE,3239440,3244960,that you normally positively anticipate and pursue.  And the reason I'm bring this  up now is because I haven't really gone
vA50EK70whE,3244960,3251200,"into depth on the dopamine system before now, you understand  that you have this very precious reward system.  That's kind of a double-edged sword."
vA50EK70whE,3251760,3257280,"It needs to be taken care of and treated well.  You wanna use it, but not overuse it, et cetera"
vA50EK70whE,3257280,3262960,but getting bright light exposure in the middle  of the night is reducing your capacity to release dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,3262960,3268880,So it's not just  about the sleep that you're not getting in that time.  It's also that you're not getting the dopamine
vA50EK70whE,3268880,3274880,"that would otherwise be available to you.  So you're actually taking, think of light  in the middle of the night as a kind"
vA50EK70whE,3274880,3280160,of antagonist is kind of a blocker of dopamine.  Maybe that'll help you.  If you're somebody who has to work
vA50EK70whE,3280160,3286400,in the middle of the night  and you wanna bypass this dopamine suppression  please see the episode about jet lag and shift work
vA50EK70whE,3286400,3291519,because there are a lot  of tips there that will allow you to do that  in order to understand how to control the dopamine system
vA50EK70whE,3291520,3296560,how to leverage it for a better life.  You need to understand the results
vA50EK70whE,3296560,3303520,of a very important experiment.  This experiment was able to separate pleasure
vA50EK70whE,3303520,3311520,"from motivation.  It's a very simple, but like many simple experiments  a very elegant experiment, what they did"
vA50EK70whE,3311520,3316320,"and this has now been done in animals.  and in humans, they offered rats food."
vA50EK70whE,3317040,3322240,It was a food that they particularly liked  and the animals would lever press for a pellet of food
vA50EK70whE,3322240,3329440,"kind of classic experiment that eat the food  and they presumably liked the food  because they were motivated, press the lever and eat it."
vA50EK70whE,3330000,3335680,Great. They took other rats.  They eliminated the dopamine neurons.
vA50EK70whE,3335680,3341680,You can do this by injection  of a neurotoxin that destroys these neurons.  So they actually had no dopamine in their brain.
vA50EK70whE,3341680,3347600,They have no ability to release dopamine  and they gave them a lever that rats would sit there
vA50EK70whE,3347600,3353440,"and they'd hit the lever and they'd eat the food.  They're still enjoyed the food.  So you say, well, okay"
vA50EK70whE,3353440,3358160,"so dopamine is involved in motivation.  It is involved in pleasure.  No, it absolutely is."
vA50EK70whE,3358720,3365680,"They could still enjoy the food, but if they moved the rat  literally one body length away from the lever."
vA50EK70whE,3366480,3374000,"What they found was the animals that had dopamine would move  over to the lever, press it and eat.  And the ones, the rats that did not have dopamine available"
vA50EK70whE,3374000,3382000,"to them, wouldn't even move one body lane, one rat length  to the lever in order to press it and get the food."
vA50EK70whE,3382000,3388880,"Dopamine, therefore is not  about the ability to experience pleasure,  it is about motivation for pleasure."
vA50EK70whE,3389600,3396000,This has been repeated in humans  in a variety of different scenarios.  You can't really do the lever press thing quite as easily
vA50EK70whE,3397600,3404320,but we know that people have low levels  of dopamine are simply less motivated  even though they can achieve pleasure.
vA50EK70whE,3404320,3410347,"And this has serious ramifications  for the fact that now, quote"
vA50EK70whE,3410347,3416400,unquote pleasure or ways to induce things that we  believe give us pleasure are everywhere.
vA50EK70whE,3416400,3422400,"And they're within reach.  We don't have to forage for our food.  There's lot of highly processed, high sugar"
vA50EK70whE,3422400,3427839,"high fat foods.  There's also foods that are healthy, that tastes good  but they're hopefully they're pretty easy to"
vA50EK70whE,3427840,3435280,"get all that different people have different access  to things, of course, but dopamine  isn't about the ability to experience pleasure."
vA50EK70whE,3435280,3441760,"It's about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures.  And so many of you are probably thinking, wow"
vA50EK70whE,3441760,3449440,I'm not a very motivated person.  Like you talked  about the one kind of procrastination earlier.  What about when I just feel kind of met about life now
vA50EK70whE,3449440,3455040,"for some of you, there may be a real clinical depression  and you should talk to a professional.  There are very good prescription drugs"
vA50EK70whE,3455600,3461359,that can really help people.  There's also great non drug treatments of psychotherapy
vA50EK70whE,3461360,3468720,"and other treatments that are being developed  in addition to psychotherapy in the various kinds  of psychoanalysis, et cetera, that one can use."
vA50EK70whE,3468720,3475600,I think the data really points  to the fact that a combination  of pharmacology and talk therapies are generally best.
vA50EK70whE,3475600,3481200,And there are a huge range of these things.  I know many of you are in these professions.  We're not gonna talk about that right now.  There's a compound.
vA50EK70whE,3481200,3486480,"That's kind of interesting in the supplement  space that isn't MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA"
vA50EK70whE,3486480,3491680,it's not L tyrosine that isn't promoting massive releases
vA50EK70whE,3491680,3496880,of dopamine or even dopamine alone  but a combination of dopamine and serotonin.
vA50EK70whE,3496880,3503920,"And it's an intriguing molecule it's sold over the counter.  Again, you have to check with your healthcare provider"
vA50EK70whE,3503920,3510559,"before you would take anything or remove anything.  That's very important, which is, but it's, fenal ethyl"
vA50EK70whE,3510560,3518800,"fenal Ethel aiming, or P-E-A pea or beta fenal Ethel"
vA50EK70whE,3519600,3528480,aiming releases dopamine at low levels  but also serotonin and low level.  So it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules
vA50EK70whE,3528480,3534800,as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules.  And people's response to this varies widely
vA50EK70whE,3535520,3541119,"but many people report feeling heightened sense  of mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera."
vA50EK70whE,3541120,3546559,It is a bit of a stimulant  like anything that triggers activation  of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway
vA50EK70whE,3546560,3552160,but is an interesting supplement.  I actually haven't tried it before.  So I can't report on my own experiences.
vA50EK70whE,3552160,3557760,"I will point you however, to examine.com.  It wouldn't be a Huberman Lab Podcast episode."
vA50EK70whE,3557760,3562880,If I didn't point you to examine.com  this incredible free resource where you can put  in any supplement.
vA50EK70whE,3562880,3568880,And it will tell you the quote unquote human effect  matrix it'll point you to the various studies.  We always provide a link to this in the caption.
vA50EK70whE,3568880,3576760,"It's an amazing resource.  So you can go there to explore more  but I haven't talked about beta Fino, L Ethel, Amy"
vA50EK70whE,3576760,3582240,and before in previous podcasts  and I wanted to add it to the list of things that tap
vA50EK70whE,3582240,3588080,into the dopamine system that are in this.  I guess we call it now the supplementation space.
vA50EK70whE,3589120,3594400,I personally am fascinated by these supplements  and the things that exist out there that are
vA50EK70whE,3594400,3600080,"non-prescription that seem to, at least  in some people have positive effects."
vA50EK70whE,3600080,3606720,"For instance, last episode  we talked about CDOT L-carnitine, which there  are several papers that report antidepressant effects"
vA50EK70whE,3606720,3611840,"as well as positive effects  on other things, sperm health, ovarian health, et cetera."
vA50EK70whE,3611840,3618960,I learned from a colleague that acetyl L-carnitine  in Europe is actually a prescription drug  in the US it's sold over the counter.
vA50EK70whE,3618960,3624640,"So I guess, depending on where you're listening to this  the availability might vary.  And as always, I put the caveat, you have to check"
vA50EK70whE,3624640,3631120,"with your healthcare provider, if it's right for you  but I'm fascinated by the fact  that these things exist and that they lie somewhere"
vA50EK70whE,3631120,3636880,between prescription drugs and doing nothing.  And that makes them interesting compounds.
vA50EK70whE,3636880,3644160,"And I think that P-E-A beta fennel ethylamine is  yet another one of the, of such compounds."
vA50EK70whE,3645120,3650800,I going to talk a lot about attention deficit  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
vA50EK70whE,3650800,3656960,"in a future episode, but I do wanna mention it today  in the context of dopamine and impulsivity."
vA50EK70whE,3656960,3663600,"So ADHD or ADD so attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, ADD our clinical diagnoses."
vA50EK70whE,3663600,3668240,I think a lot of people nowadays walk around and say  I have ADD or you have ADD
vA50EK70whE,3669120,3674240,and indeed one can create a sort  of ADD by attention switching all the time.
vA50EK70whE,3674880,3680960,"I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.  He wrote the book"" deep work.""  I believe he was the one who said context"
vA50EK70whE,3680960,3687200,"switching is terrible for the brain.  It's like the worst thing for the brain  because then the brain learns to context, switch"
vA50EK70whE,3687200,3692400,"and real deep work productivity, learning of all kinds  good relationships of all kinds"
vA50EK70whE,3692400,3698160,really come from depth of experience  not from breadth of experience within the moment.
vA50EK70whE,3698160,3703280,And so I think it's important to know that  there's clinical ADHD and ADD
vA50EK70whE,3703280,3709039,and then there's the kind that people are kind  of inducing and through distraction
vA50EK70whE,3709040,3716400,"and social media and phones, et cetera.  And those can sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD"
vA50EK70whE,3716960,3725920,But I wanna talk about ADHD and ADD in kids just briefly  the drugs that are normally given to treat those conditions
vA50EK70whE,3725920,3732480,"ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall  things that have very amphetamine, light qualities"
vA50EK70whE,3732480,3739920,"and structures, and you might ask, why would they do that?  Well, it turns out that in kids"
vA50EK70whE,3739920,3747360,these activate that for brain circuitry  the break that exists on the deeper mesolimbic circuitry.
vA50EK70whE,3747360,3752800,"So as you recall, there's the VTA and nucleus accumbens  as the kind of accelerators on dopamine.  And then there's the prefrontal cortex"
vA50EK70whE,3752800,3758400,which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity.  And those drugs tend to increase the activity
vA50EK70whE,3758400,3765759,"of neurons in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex  and it reduces impulsivity.  In fact, there's a experiment described in the book"
vA50EK70whE,3765760,3771680,"""the molecule of more,"" which is really interesting  where they looked at impulsivity in obese children"
vA50EK70whE,3771680,3777040,and it turns out they did this experiment  in a safe way that they looked at kids
vA50EK70whE,3778000,3783520,both obese kids and non obese kids  and their willingness to cross a very busy highway.
vA50EK70whE,3783520,3789440,And it turns out that the obese kids got hit  by cars more often than non obese children.
vA50EK70whE,3789440,3796480,It turns out this was a virtual reality experiment  and it had nothing to do  with the fact that they were obese  or limitations on movement or speed of movement.
vA50EK70whE,3796480,3802560,It was that the obese children were more impulsive  in a variety of contexts  not just in this virtual crossing the street thing.
vA50EK70whE,3802560,3809040,And it turns out the data point to the fact  that impulsivity at age 10 is actually predictive
vA50EK70whE,3809040,3815279,of overeating disorders at a later stage in life.  So some of these drugs that are designed to
vA50EK70whE,3815280,3820400,create heightened activity in the braking system  the decelerator
vA50EK70whE,3820400,3826400,of the reward pathway are designed to reduce impulsivity  because they suppress the release of dopamine
vA50EK70whE,3826400,3834160,"and they allow, hopefully they allow children and it  and when they become adults to better control the schedule"
vA50EK70whE,3834160,3839360,of dopamine release.  So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule  and how you can leverage this
vA50EK70whE,3839920,3846480,in order to have heightened levels of motivation  but not get so much dopamine  that you're experiencing or a crash afterwards.
vA50EK70whE,3846480,3852320,"And also, so that you can experience heightened pleasure  from the various pursuits that you are engaged in life."
vA50EK70whE,3852320,3857920,I know many of you are interested  in tools that will allow you to be more motivated
vA50EK70whE,3857920,3863359,"to focus longer, sleep better.  That's really what the Huberman Lab Podcast is all about"
vA50EK70whE,3863360,3869680,but always framed in the context  of neuro-biological principles and objective mechanisms.
vA50EK70whE,3870320,3877600,There are some tools that we can apply  to the dopamine system  and motivation that can really improve our ability to stay
vA50EK70whE,3877600,3884320,"in pursuit of things, as well as enjoy things  after we've achieved our goals, or even an route, our goals."
vA50EK70whE,3885120,3890480,And here's the key principle.  Dopamine is very subjective.
vA50EK70whE,3891040,3899760,Meaning you can  either allow yourself to experience the pleasure  of reaching a milestone of achieving or some craving or not.
vA50EK70whE,3900640,3906480,"Now that won't work in the extreme cases of drugs  like cocaine and amphetamine, but it's actually"
vA50EK70whE,3906480,3913440,"pretty powerful what one can do with the subjective system.  In fact, I'm gonna describe  to you an experiment that highlights just how"
vA50EK70whE,3913440,3919440,powerful the subjective readout  or the subjective interpretation  of a given experience really can be.
vA50EK70whE,3919440,3924720,Even at the level of pharmacology.  I love examples of subjective effects
vA50EK70whE,3924720,3930079,over things that would otherwise seem hardwired  because they really illustrate the interplay
vA50EK70whE,3930080,3935840,"between our cognition, our belief system  and what would otherwise be these,"
vA50EK70whE,3936400,3943040,"just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of,  you eat X amount of chocolate  or you drink X amount of water"
vA50EK70whE,3943040,3948320,after being water deprived for a certain amount of time.  And you get X amount of dopamine.  Here's the experiment.
vA50EK70whE,3948320,3954400,"The experiment was just published on March 18, 2021.  So very recently, and the title"
vA50EK70whE,3954400,3961440,of the experiment is expectation  for stimulant type modifies  caffeine is effects on mood and cognition
vA50EK70whE,3961440,3971680,and this was done in college students.  And it's a fascinating study.  What they did is they gave college students either placebo
vA50EK70whE,3972560,3980480,"essentially nothing or 200 milligrams of caffeine.  200 milligrams of caffeine is  about what's in a well, a typical coffee"
vA50EK70whE,3980480,3986320,like a medium coffee that you buy a drip coffee  or a coffee that you'd make at home.  It's a fair amount of caffeine.
vA50EK70whE,3986320,3994400,If you were to take in pill form  it would definitely make you feel more alert  unless you were one of those mutants  literally mutants that is insensitive to caffeine.
vA50EK70whE,3994400,4000640,And those mutants are pretty rare.  So they took 65 undergraduate students in college.
vA50EK70whE,4000640,4005680,They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine  and they told them
vA50EK70whE,4005680,4011920,"that they were either getting caffeine or Adderall.  Now, Adderall cognitively carries"
vA50EK70whE,4011920,4017360,a very different expectation.  College students know Adderall to be a much
vA50EK70whE,4017360,4023360,stronger stimulant than caffeine.  They know it to create a sort of high.  This is the way the students described it
vA50EK70whE,4023360,4031600,and they thought that it would increase their level  of focus and their ability to perform work.  So it was really interesting is there was definitely
vA50EK70whE,4031600,4036080,"an effect of placebo versus caffeine.  That's not surprising, however, right, you take a placebo"
vA50EK70whE,4036720,4042240,you may or may not feel more alert  but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine  very likely you're gonna feel very alert
vA50EK70whE,4042240,4048800,but there was also an effect of whether or not  the students thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.
vA50EK70whE,4048800,4055360,"The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling  more stimulated, anxious, and motivated  than the subjects that received the placebo."
vA50EK70whE,4055360,4062000,Okay. But the ones that expected Adderall  reported stronger amphetamine effects.  So they felt much more high.
vA50EK70whE,4062000,4069520,"They performed better on a working memory test.  And in general, they had all the increased cognitive"
vA50EK70whE,4069520,4078240,effects that would have been seen with Adderall  but they were only ingesting caffeine.  And so this shows an interaction between the drug caffeine
vA50EK70whE,4078240,4083760,and the expectation that it was Adderall.  So it led to heightened performance simply
vA50EK70whE,4083760,4090400,because the students thought they were getting Adderall.  And I don't know whether  or not they told them at the end that it wasn't Adderall.
vA50EK70whE,4090400,4096000,I doubt that they did this.  If you wanna look it up  the study was published in the journal
vA50EK70whE,4096000,4103040,of experimental clinical psychopharmacology.  The paper is Looby L-O-O-B-Y at all.
vA50EK70whE,4103040,4110240,"And again, it was just published March 18th, 2021 speaks  to the fact that yes, there are so-called placebo effects"
vA50EK70whE,4110240,4117199,but this is different than placebo.  This is a belief effect about what the specific reactions  to a given stimulant ought to be.
vA50EK70whE,4117200,4122960,And I think this is very important because I think  that it points to the fact that the top
vA50EK70whE,4122960,4128719,down the kind of higher level cognitive processes  are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects
vA50EK70whE,4128720,4136000,of the say dopamine release  or our mountain adrenaline release or epinephrin release  in ways that can positively impact performance.
vA50EK70whE,4136000,4141359,"In this case, it was a positive improvement  in working memory and focus.  As long as we were talking about caffeine"
vA50EK70whE,4141359,4146720,I'd like to point out a study.  That's really interesting.  This was published in journal of neuroscience
vA50EK70whE,4146720,4152160,which is the society  for neurosciences kind of flagship journal.  It's their journal.  It's a good journal
vA50EK70whE,4152720,4157280,and what they showed was  that caffeine can increase dopamine release  in the brain by about 30%.
vA50EK70whE,4157920,4163119,"That wasn't surprising.  I even said that earlier, but what they also showed is"
vA50EK70whE,4163120,4170480,that it has a protective effect on dopamine neurons.  So caffeine in some cases may not just
vA50EK70whE,4170480,4176719,increase dopamine release  but it might actually have a protective effect  on dopamine neurons.  Now that's distinctly different
vA50EK70whE,4176720,4182240,from some claims that drugs like MDMA ecstasy have been
vA50EK70whE,4182240,4188799,"it's been argued can, are neurotoxic  for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons.  The study that was published about that"
vA50EK70whE,4188799,4195280,"in the journal science, which is an extremely  prestigious excellent journal later, it was shown"
vA50EK70whE,4195280,4203280,"that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy that was given in that case.  It was actually amphetamine, which is known to"
vA50EK70whE,4203280,4209520,destroy dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.  So what does this mean?  This means that low levels of caffeine may at least
vA50EK70whE,4209520,4216080,in a few studies be protective for dopamine neurons  over time that MDMA ecstasy something that's
vA50EK70whE,4216080,4221600,in clinical trials right now for the treatment of trauma  PTSD of various kinds and depression
vA50EK70whE,4221600,4227680,but still illegal at this point in time may  although it doesn't appear yet from any published studies
vA50EK70whE,4227680,4233199,"destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps origin, urgent neuron.  So there's a real asterix and a question mark there"
vA50EK70whE,4233200,4240000,but amphetamine and in particular methamphetamine  is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.
vA50EK70whE,4240000,4244640,So I don't think any of us needed any additional  reasons to avoid methamphetamine.
vA50EK70whE,4245200,4252880,"This drug that creates huge increases in dopamine  and then huge crashes  from that dopamine, very destructive drug."
vA50EK70whE,4252880,4260080,"But in addition  to that seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons from time  to time, I've talked about nicotine on here, not smoking"
vA50EK70whE,4260080,4269920,"because obviously smoking is bad lung cancer's bad  for health, et cetera, but nicotine in supplemental form"
vA50EK70whE,4269920,4275520,I've mentioned that a very famous neuroscientists  Nobel prize winning scientists choose a lot of Nicorette.
vA50EK70whE,4275520,4281760,I know other people that you Nicorette  they believe in its neuroprotective effects  for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
vA50EK70whE,4281760,4287120,and indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.  We talked about that earlier  whether or not it has a protective effect
vA50EK70whE,4287120,4291680,isn't clear the protective effects might be  through the noradrenergic and acetylcholine systems.
vA50EK70whE,4292240,4300000,Those findings are still unclear  but it is interesting to note  that nicotine can increase prolactin.
vA50EK70whE,4300000,4305760,Somewhat. There are a couple  of studies I'd be happy to link to them  in the caption that shows that nicotine taken too much
vA50EK70whE,4305760,4311680,over too long periods of time can also increase prolactin  which again is the opposite side of dopamine.
vA50EK70whE,4311680,4318960,So today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system  and those kinds of schedules that will allow craving
vA50EK70whE,4318960,4324560,"or addiction, but what's the schedule of dopamine.  That's going to allow you to maximize"
vA50EK70whE,4324560,4330720,on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain.  And we get the answer to that
vA50EK70whE,4330720,4337760,"from our good friend gambling, the reason gambling works  the reason why people will throw their lives away."
vA50EK70whE,4337760,4345680,The reason why people go back again and again and again  to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic city is
vA50EK70whE,4345680,4350960,"because of the hope and anticipation it's  as those are cities in places built on dopamine,"
vA50EK70whE,4351840,4358400,they are leveraging your dopamine system.  And I realized that there are experienced gamblers.  There are people that enjoy gambling.
vA50EK70whE,4358400,4366480,"I'll actually just say,  I like sitting at the roulette table.  I was take a designated amount of money.  It's not much, I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette."
vA50EK70whE,4366480,4372719,I certainly enjoy when I win.  I certainly don't like it when I lose  but I do it cheerly for the pleasure of playing.  And I do it very seldom.
vA50EK70whE,4372720,4379520,"I don't have a gambling problem.  And if I did, I'd probably tell you  but I don't have a gambling problem."
vA50EK70whE,4379520,4386239,Yet people throw away the entire lives on gambling.  And as a friend of mine  who's a certified addiction treatment specialist tells me
vA50EK70whE,4386240,4392480,that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister  because the next time really could be the thing
vA50EK70whE,4392480,4398960,that changes everything.  Unlike other addictions  the next time really could change everything.  And that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict
vA50EK70whE,4398960,4404320,and rarely does it work out in favor  of the wellbeing of the gambling addict and their family.
vA50EK70whE,4405200,4411600,"However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule  was discovered long ago by scientific researchers."
vA50EK70whE,4411600,4419840,"So this is the slot machine that every once  in a while gives you a wind to keep you playing.  This is the, the probability of winning on the craps table"
vA50EK70whE,4419840,4425520,"or the roulette table, or at blackjack just often enough  that you're willing to buy tickets, head out there"
vA50EK70whE,4425520,4433199,"play again, go downstairs again from your room  even though you swore you were done for the night  intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form"
vA50EK70whE,4433200,4439840,of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something  so we can export that.  We can use it for good.
vA50EK70whE,4439840,4445520,"If there's something that you're pursuing in life  whether or not it's an academic goal  or a financial goal, a relationship goal."
vA50EK70whE,4446880,4453680,"One of the things that you can do to ensure  that you will remain on the path to that goal  for a very long time, and that you will continue to"
vA50EK70whE,4453680,4459040,exceed your previous performance as well  as continue to enjoy the dopamine release that
vA50EK70whE,4459040,4466960,occurs when you hit the milestones that you want to  achieve is to occasionally remove reward
vA50EK70whE,4466960,4472800,"subjectively, let's say you set out a goal of making  I'm gonna make this quantitative with respect to finances"
vA50EK70whE,4472800,4478080,'cause it just is an easy description  but this could also be in sport.  This could be in school.  This could be in music
vA50EK70whE,4478080,4483600,could be in anything creative endeavors  but let's say you set out a certain financial goal  or let's say you wanna get a certain number
vA50EK70whE,4483600,4489360,of followers on whatever social media platform  as you reach each one of those goals.
vA50EK70whE,4489360,4497520,You should know now that the amount  of dopamine is not going to peak.  It's actually going to diminish  and make you crave more the key to avoiding that crash
vA50EK70whE,4498080,4504559,"but to still keep it in healthy levels  that will allow you to continue.  Your pursuit is as you are, stair casing toward your goal."
vA50EK70whE,4505200,4511840,"Maybe that's dollars, maybe that's followers  maybe that's grades  maybe that's some other metric it's metals or trophies."
vA50EK70whE,4514080,4521440,You actually want to blunt the reward response  for some of those intermediate goals.  Now I'm not telling you should celebrate your wins
vA50EK70whE,4521440,4526400,but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them.  Whereas a good friend of mine who recently
vA50EK70whE,4526960,4532880,fortunately for him had a great financial success.  He asked me and somebody else a good friend of mine.
vA50EK70whE,4532880,4539679,"Who's very tuned into dopamine  reward schedules understands how they work  at a really deep level.  And he said,"" I don't know what to do next."""
vA50EK70whE,4539680,4545600,"And we said,"" Oh, well, that's simple,  You should just give most of it away.""  And this wasn't a ploy to receive any"
vA50EK70whE,4545600,4550079,of the money ourselves.  This was really about reducing the impact of that reward.
vA50EK70whE,4550640,4555840,Now hopefully giving them money away.  If you already have enough  of it would be something that was rewarding
vA50EK70whE,4555840,4562800,"in and of itself.  But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university  or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals"
vA50EK70whE,4563520,4571679,it actually makes sense from a rational perspective.  Once you understand these mechanisms to hit a new high point
vA50EK70whE,4571680,4577360,"of performance, or to get that A-plus or a for you  if it's an A-minus, et cetera"
vA50EK70whE,4577360,4584159,"and to tell yourself, okay, that was good.  But to actually actively blunt the reward to not go"
vA50EK70whE,4584160,4590800,"and celebrate too intensely, because in doing that  you keep your dopamine system in check and you ensure"
vA50EK70whE,4590800,4596800,"that you're gonna stay on the path of continued pursuit  not just for that thing, but for all things big increases"
vA50EK70whE,4596800,4602480,in dopamine leads to big crashes  in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the ante.
vA50EK70whE,4602480,4610239,They increase the extent to which you are willing to  invest time and energy in order to achieve goals
vA50EK70whE,4610240,4618880,"and rewards that may be out of your reach.  You never really know if you're going to succeed.  So to make this crystal clear, celebrate your wins"
vA50EK70whE,4618880,4624800,but don't celebrate every win.  That's one way that you can ensure  that you're going to continue down the path of progress.
vA50EK70whE,4624800,4631360,And I think most of the learning tools that are  in schools are about reward for genuine performance.
vA50EK70whE,4631920,4637599,They are about encouraging us.  We do have to believe that we can perform well.  One of the hallmarks of growth mindset is
vA50EK70whE,4637600,4643120,the internalization that we're not getting it right yet.  The word yet is very important.
vA50EK70whE,4643760,4651760,"And also the sense that we reward  our good behavior, our good performance, but not every time."
vA50EK70whE,4651760,4657760,One way to do this is to actually take the reward  and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind.
vA50EK70whE,4657760,4663440,And you tell somebody that they are in control of  whether or not you're allowed to feel good about your wins.
vA50EK70whE,4663440,4669920,"Now, I realize it's very unnatural for most people  but if you're somebody who simply going to be in pursuit"
vA50EK70whE,4669920,4675040,"and you're going to really register your wins, and you think  that that's gonna actually make you a better performer"
vA50EK70whE,4675040,4681120,"it will in the short term, but not in the longterm.  So you can lift the what Las Vegas"
vA50EK70whE,4681120,4686480,and Atlantic city and other gambling mechanisms  and places have known for a long time.
vA50EK70whE,4686480,4692320,They lifted it from the scientists.  You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that.  And you just make it intermittent.
vA50EK70whE,4692320,4697440,"You reward yourself, not on a predictable schedule  so not every other time or every third time"
vA50EK70whE,4697440,4704400,"or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three  in a row then not at all for 10 days.  So reward is important."
vA50EK70whE,4704400,4711600,Self reward is critically important  but make sure that you're not doing it  on such a predictable schedule that you burn
vA50EK70whE,4711600,4717680,out these dopamine circuits or  that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve.
vA50EK70whE,4718480,4725120,Actually have a story from graduate school  which I was forced  into an intermittent reinforcement schedule
vA50EK70whE,4725120,4729920,that I do believe has served me very well  in my scientific career and other aspects of life.
vA50EK70whE,4730480,4737600,"My graduate advisor was an amazing scientist.  Unfortunately, she passed away  but amazing scientists and amazing human being"
vA50EK70whE,4737600,4745520,"with a very dry and somewhat cruel sense of humor.  Her name was Barbara Chapman, and we published a paper"
vA50EK70whE,4745520,4750960,"in the journal, science and science nature  and cell are considered the big three"
vA50EK70whE,4750960,4757840,the most competitive journals to publish in.  And I had a first author paper in science.  It was really exciting to me.
vA50EK70whE,4757840,4764160,I was a graduate student.  I was very excited about the discovery.  I was excited that it was in science.  I was just thrilled.
vA50EK70whE,4764800,4771280,And I remember when the paper finally got accepted  because it had involved a ton  of revisions and a lot of very hard work.
vA50EK70whE,4771920,4779280,"And she came in and she said,"" paper got accepted.""  I was super excited  and she just kind of sat there and nodded, and I said"
vA50EK70whE,4780160,4785520,"""are we gonna celebrate, are we gonna have a party?""  Or what, like, what are we gonna do it?  And I'll never forget her answer."
vA50EK70whE,4785520,4791600,"She said,"" I think we should skip this one.""  And I thought she was joking."
vA50EK70whE,4791600,4799280,"And I said,"" what do you mean skip this one?""  We're gonna publish the paper.  He said, yeah, we're gonna publish the paper.  But she said, "" maybe when you get like four more"
vA50EK70whE,4800000,4805440,"maybe three, maybe two too.""  And I thought she was messing  with me and she wasn't messing with me.  And she was right."
vA50EK70whE,4805440,4812320,We never had a party.  We had a celebration for that paper.  I think she was really trying to instill two ideas in me.
vA50EK70whE,4812320,4818239,One is that the work itself was what was supposed to  be most rewarding.  That practice of experimentation
vA50EK70whE,4818240,4824000,"a writing the paper, the experience  of achieving something they worked very hard at  and that did indeed feel amazing."
vA50EK70whE,4824000,4829120,"I actually can still feel it in my body.  Now, the excitement.  So there's a, still a dopamine release"
vA50EK70whE,4829120,4834960,or that arc is going very long.  This would be almost 20 years ago now that this happened.
vA50EK70whE,4834960,4840480,So that's remarkable.  The other one is that she's right.  We never went out and celebrated
vA50EK70whE,4840480,4848880,and we did celebrate other wins  other papers in the future and things of that sort.  But she was either consciously or subconsciously putting me
vA50EK70whE,4848880,4854079,on an intermittent reward schedule.  And to this day when something really good happens
vA50EK70whE,4854080,4859440,I actually hesitate as to whether or not I wanna  internalize that and celebrate whether I wanna
vA50EK70whE,4859440,4865520,tell anybody which is its own form of celebration  because then you're getting positive feedback.  And so I'm very cautious
vA50EK70whE,4865520,4870960,with how I deploy dopamine release in response to wins.  It's certainly not the only way that I've
vA50EK70whE,4870960,4878719,navigated my career.  There are a number of other principles I incorporate  but intermittent reward for wins
vA50EK70whE,4879360,4884480,for achievements is a very powerful way to ensure  that you will stay on the path of pursuit.
vA50EK70whE,4885120,4890320,At this point in the podcast  I'd like to take a moment to address some corrections.
vA50EK70whE,4890320,4895600,I made some errors in previous episodes.  They weren't major errors  but a couple of you pointed them out
vA50EK70whE,4895600,4902239,and it's important to me that we strive for accuracy.  So the first one was I talked in a previous episode
vA50EK70whE,4902240,4909599,"about the potential benefits for some people, not all  of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol"
vA50EK70whE,4909600,4916240,"and a way of offsetting medium term,  and some long-term stress.  It's a supplement that I've benefited from."
vA50EK70whE,4916240,4922880,"It works through the GABA system  and some other systems, someone pointed  out a study that admittedly was done in rats."
vA50EK70whE,4922880,4929280,"I point I was focusing mainly  on studies in humans during the episode, but they point  out a study that was done in rats that showed"
vA50EK70whE,4929280,4936560,that long-term administration of ashwagandha  could actually create some negative effects mainly
vA50EK70whE,4936560,4942080,on the fibroid and perhaps even the cortisol system  maybe the melatonin system.
vA50EK70whE,4942080,4947760,I just wanna acknowledge that study.  I'll reference it in the caption again  that was a rat study.
vA50EK70whE,4947760,4953520,I was focused on human studies.  Please go to examine.com.  Put in ashwagandha will tell you the various effects
vA50EK70whE,4953520,4958639,on different aspects of brain and body.  It will also link to the pub med articles  that are relevant there
vA50EK70whE,4958640,4963679,it is called the human effect matrix  'cause that's only focused on humans.  That's one of the reasons I like examined.com
vA50EK70whE,4963680,4969199,"as it's focused on human studies, again  a wonderful free resource, but I do appreciate"
vA50EK70whE,4969200,4978000,that you pointed out that study  because I do want people to be aware of the range  of effects that these various compounds can have as well.
vA50EK70whE,4978000,4984880,A couple of times in previous episodes  I said five HTP and not five HT five
vA50EK70whE,4984880,4991120,HT is serotonin five  HTP is a precursor to a serotonin.  I was talking about supplements
vA50EK70whE,4991120,4996239,"and compounds that can stimulate the release of serotonin.  In the previous episode, I was actually referring"
vA50EK70whE,4996240,5001680,to it in a context  for which I don't personally like to take five HTP.  That's just my own bias
vA50EK70whE,5002560,5011119,"for reasons I described in that episode.  But if you heard me say five HTP  when I meant to say five HT, I apologize."
vA50EK70whE,5011120,5017760,"And then last, I just wanna point out again  something that I mentioned at the beginning  which is that the Huberman Lab Podcast is now subtitled"
vA50EK70whE,5017760,5024560,in Spanish episodes one and two  as well as our welcome video are in Spanish.  The other ones will be subtitled soon.
vA50EK70whE,5024560,5031520,You can expect that within the next couple of weeks.  So if you know Spanish speaking  people who prefer to digest the information
vA50EK70whE,5031520,5037280,"in Spanish or that's,  you can look forward to the Spanish subtitles.  You need to activate those"
vA50EK70whE,5037920,5045120,"in the caption feature on YouTube.  Unfortunately, we don't have Spanish dubbing  over on the audio platforms."
vA50EK70whE,5045840,5051600,"I realized once again, we've covered a lot of material.  Hopefully you now know far more"
vA50EK70whE,5051600,5057040,about the dopamine system reward and motivation  than you did at the beginning of this podcast.
vA50EK70whE,5057680,5065440,"Hopefully you also understand the other side  of dopamine and reward, which is pain  and the balance of this pleasure pain system, as well"
vA50EK70whE,5065440,5071280,"as the molecules that we call or that were described  in the molecule of more book, I should say"
vA50EK70whE,5071280,5078719,"as the here and now molecules  things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.  We talked about a variety of supplement based tools,"
vA50EK70whE,5078720,5085360,things like vitamin B6 and zinc  as they relate to prolactin P-E-A  Very interesting compound again
vA50EK70whE,5085360,5095280,"I've never tried it very interesting  definitely in use out there L-DOPA MuCuna  appearings talked about caffeine, talked about nicotine."
vA50EK70whE,5095280,5102000,"Talk about how some of the effects  of Adderall can be created purely cognitively  without actually ingesting Adderall, simply"
vA50EK70whE,5102000,5107360,by telling people they're ingesting Adderall  giving them caffeine.  Very interesting study that I referenced a
vA50EK70whE,5107360,5116160,"little bit earlier,  and we talked about scheduling dopamine  adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself"
vA50EK70whE,5116160,5121680,in order to ensure long-term engagement  with pursuits that I hope are healthy pursuits
vA50EK70whE,5121680,5127120,and ones that serve you well  this was by no means an exhaustive coverage
vA50EK70whE,5127120,5132560,"of all things, dopamine and motivation.  It was by no means.  The only time that we're gonna talk"
vA50EK70whE,5132560,5140000,"about dopamine and motivation, next episode  we're gonna continue to talk  about emotions from yet another perspective"
vA50EK70whE,5140000,5145600,"but hopefully you have enough now to think  about in the meantime, and that you can consider adopting"
vA50EK70whE,5145600,5151280,in your own life and practices as always.  I really wanna thank you for your time and attention.
vA50EK70whE,5151280,5157920,"If you learned something useful today, please pass it along.  One of the things that we teach  in science that I think is really wonderful"
vA50EK70whE,5157920,5164960,"to adopt in general in life is this idea  of watch one, do one, teach one.  This is what we tell graduate students and med students"
vA50EK70whE,5164960,5172160,"and post-docs watch somebody do something, learn it  then do it, apply it, see  if it works for you and then teach it."
vA50EK70whE,5172160,5180639,"So it's usually not watch one, do one, teach one.  It's usually watch one  do 20 teach as many people as you possibly want."
vA50EK70whE,5180640,5186159,I'm not looking for attribution.  These are tools that are grounded  in neuroscience for which I can't claim attribution.
vA50EK70whE,5186160,5192000,I'm just passing them along so  that you can adopt them if you like and pass them along.  If you think people can benefit
vA50EK70whE,5192000,5196960,"from them, many of you have continued to ask how  you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast."

vA50EK70whE,5263040,5268320,Because we mentioned supplements  from time to time throughout the podcast  and people always ask about what brands
vA50EK70whE,5268320,5273200,and sources we use or suggest for those supplements.  We partnered with Thorne
vA50EK70whE,5273840,5279679,T-H-O-R-N-E Thorne supplements are known to be  among the most stringent supplements
vA50EK70whE,5279680,5286240,in terms of the specificity of what's  in the bottle matches what's on the label.  The quality of the ingredients is exceedingly high
vA50EK70whE,5286960,5292960,the Mayo Clinic  and all the major sports organizations are partnered  with Thorne because of that stringency
vA50EK70whE,5292960,5297520,and that commitment to rigor.  If you'd like to see the supplements  that I personally take
