iRyR8VuKDcQ,118479,120320,got it in paper form yet but from the
iRyR8VuKDcQ,120320,122479,press conference that yen stoltenberg
iRyR8VuKDcQ,122479,124479,gave i'll just run you through exactly
iRyR8VuKDcQ,124479,126079,what he's said he said that the two
iRyR8VuKDcQ,126079,128239,major agreements between turkey finland
iRyR8VuKDcQ,128239,130560,and sweden are firstly on arms control
iRyR8VuKDcQ,130560,132160,we don't exactly know the details of
iRyR8VuKDcQ,132160,135120,that yet but the second is on terrorism
iRyR8VuKDcQ,135120,137200,and trying to work together to counter
iRyR8VuKDcQ,137200,138879,terrorism and we know
iRyR8VuKDcQ,138879,141040,that they have agreed that they will and
iRyR8VuKDcQ,141040,142720,this is what they say is to commit to
iRyR8VuKDcQ,142720,144239,tackle threats to nationals to the
iRyR8VuKDcQ,144239,146560,national security of turkey and to crack
iRyR8VuKDcQ,146560,149280,down on pkk terrorists with an agreement
iRyR8VuKDcQ,149280,151120,on extradition this is an interesting
iRyR8VuKDcQ,151120,153760,detail because turkey accuses finland
iRyR8VuKDcQ,153760,156239,and sweden of harbouring members or
iRyR8VuKDcQ,156239,158879,connected people to the pkk terrorist
iRyR8VuKDcQ,158879,160480,organization the terrorist separatist
iRyR8VuKDcQ,160480,161519,group
iRyR8VuKDcQ,161519,162959,and the big question is what will this
iRyR8VuKDcQ,162959,165200,agreement now mean will those people
iRyR8VuKDcQ,165200,167599,that have find safe harbor in finland
iRyR8VuKDcQ,167599,170000,and sweden who claim to be uh you know
iRyR8VuKDcQ,170000,172239,fighting uh for their freedoms against
iRyR8VuKDcQ,172239,174640,turkey in that in the conflict between
iRyR8VuKDcQ,174640,178319,those those two uh you know parks people
iRyR8VuKDcQ,178319,180720,two areas uh will they now face
iRyR8VuKDcQ,180720,181920,extradition
iRyR8VuKDcQ,181920,184400,jen schottenberg said that this will uh
iRyR8VuKDcQ,184400,186560,all be done under european human rights
iRyR8VuKDcQ,186560,188800,law but he also said that tomorrow when
iRyR8VuKDcQ,188800,190959,the leaders meet in earnest all 30 nato
iRyR8VuKDcQ,190959,193360,leaders but they will invite sweden and
iRyR8VuKDcQ,193360,196000,finland to join the nato military alone
iRyR8VuKDcQ,196000,197760,yes yeah i mean the details there it
iRyR8VuKDcQ,197760,198879,sounds like the details have to be
iRyR8VuKDcQ,198879,201120,finalized on that but we do have a green
iRyR8VuKDcQ,201120,203200,light and so what is this going to mean
iRyR8VuKDcQ,203200,204640,jack then for
iRyR8VuKDcQ,204640,207360,the the summit this nato summit that
iRyR8VuKDcQ,207360,210080,you're attending in terms of support for
iRyR8VuKDcQ,210080,213080,ukraine
iRyR8VuKDcQ,214080,215280,it's a really interesting one i think
iRyR8VuKDcQ,215280,216799,brent because i think we were all
iRyR8VuKDcQ,216799,218480,expecting that this two-day summit was
iRyR8VuKDcQ,218480,221440,going to be a real grind over this issue
iRyR8VuKDcQ,221440,223519,u.s president joe biden who's already
iRyR8VuKDcQ,223519,225120,arrived here in madrid he was meant to
iRyR8VuKDcQ,225120,226400,be meeting
iRyR8VuKDcQ,226400,228879,tomorrow directly one-on-one with russia
iRyR8VuKDcQ,228879,231519,tayyip erdogan the turkish president to
iRyR8VuKDcQ,231519,233120,try and hammer out this issue but now it
iRyR8VuKDcQ,233120,234640,looks like it's resolved all of the
iRyR8VuKDcQ,234640,236480,foreign ministers of the three countries
iRyR8VuKDcQ,236480,237920,have nice sat down and resolved this
iRyR8VuKDcQ,237920,239280,which means as you say that they can
iRyR8VuKDcQ,239280,241040,focus on ukraine we already know that
iRyR8VuKDcQ,241040,245280,nato is going to put 300 000 troops on
iRyR8VuKDcQ,245280,247599,high alert on the eastern flank of the
iRyR8VuKDcQ,247599,249840,military alliance over the concerns of
iRyR8VuKDcQ,249840,251360,what russia is doing and now really they
iRyR8VuKDcQ,251360,254000,can also get to grips with tackling how
iRyR8VuKDcQ,254000,255920,they're going to support ukraine which
iRyR8VuKDcQ,255920,257840,all of the nato military alliance wants
iRyR8VuKDcQ,257840,259759,to do specifically with weapons we've
iRyR8VuKDcQ,259759,261840,had the klitschko brothers here in the
iRyR8VuKDcQ,261840,263440,press room earlier saying that they need
iRyR8VuKDcQ,263440,265600,weapons in ukraine in order to fight
iRyR8VuKDcQ,265600,268400,this invasion but also now brent it does
iRyR8VuKDcQ,268400,270880,open up some other discussions a lot of
iRyR8VuKDcQ,270880,272639,analysts have been saying that perhaps
iRyR8VuKDcQ,272639,274320,china's militarization needs to be
iRyR8VuKDcQ,274320,276240,confronted and that might leave some
iRyR8VuKDcQ,276240,278240,space in the agenda over the two-day
iRyR8VuKDcQ,278240,280400,summit coming up to discuss other issues
iRyR8VuKDcQ,280400,283479,as well
