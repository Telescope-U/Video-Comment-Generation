nuSHSnnz4cg,21680,24160,this is our second day shooting in cairo
nuSHSnnz4cg,24160,25680,already it's been a bit of a challenge
nuSHSnnz4cg,25680,27119,shooting here today we thought it would
nuSHSnnz4cg,27119,28560,be better to drop the producer
nuSHSnnz4cg,28560,30560,altogether he's a bit useless anyways
nuSHSnnz4cg,30560,32320,it's just better for us to go out as
nuSHSnnz4cg,32320,34399,tourists and try to see what we can eat
nuSHSnnz4cg,34399,36079,on the streets last time on our
nuSHSnnz4cg,36079,38000,nightmare egypt tour the police took
nuSHSnnz4cg,38000,39680,away our cameras are they gonna ask for
nuSHSnnz4cg,39680,40480,money
nuSHSnnz4cg,40480,42559,no idea then when we tried to shoot with
nuSHSnnz4cg,42559,44399,iphones they asked us to delete our
nuSHSnnz4cg,44399,45840,footage this is what it's like to shoot
nuSHSnnz4cg,45840,47840,here now the smart move is to leave
nuSHSnnz4cg,47840,51680,cairo but i never claimed to be smart
nuSHSnnz4cg,51680,55039,i regret this immediately
nuSHSnnz4cg,55440,56719,oh

nuSHSnnz4cg,97119,99280,but i guess i'll have to find out but
nuSHSnnz4cg,99280,103680,probably not right after breakfast
nuSHSnnz4cg,107680,109680,off the main roads if you duck into the
nuSHSnnz4cg,109680,111439,right alleyways you'll find clumps of
nuSHSnnz4cg,111439,113840,street food vendors like here next to an
nuSHSnnz4cg,113840,116079,intersection in a residential area meat
nuSHSnnz4cg,116079,118240,sellers capitalize on the constant foot
nuSHSnnz4cg,118240,120159,traffic customers are lured in by the
nuSHSnnz4cg,120159,123050,heavy wafts of grilled and fried beef
nuSHSnnz4cg,123050,125280,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,125280,126880,boom we've come to our first destination
nuSHSnnz4cg,126880,129360,behind me we've got sausages liver but
nuSHSnnz4cg,129360,131360,look at this this is my favorite it's a
nuSHSnnz4cg,131360,133520,big cow hat it looks like it's been
nuSHSnnz4cg,133520,135760,dried or maybe a witch put a spell on it
nuSHSnnz4cg,135760,138879,i don't know let's go find out more
nuSHSnnz4cg,138879,140319,and then this is where the magic happens
nuSHSnnz4cg,140319,142000,so it looks like everything here is beef
nuSHSnnz4cg,142000,144800,oriented that is sausage
nuSHSnnz4cg,144800,147520,intestine sausage
nuSHSnnz4cg,147520,148720,liver
nuSHSnnz4cg,148720,152480,tongue oh cool okay okay can i have two
nuSHSnnz4cg,152480,155800,cow head
nuSHSnnz4cg,158720,160000,it's just beefy there's no real
nuSHSnnz4cg,160000,161440,seasonings in it and it tastes like it's
nuSHSnnz4cg,161440,163200,been braised for like four or five hours
nuSHSnnz4cg,163200,166720,but this should be in something
nuSHSnnz4cg,168000,170560,this beet is eaten in a sandwich various
nuSHSnnz4cg,170560,172480,beef cuts are sliced and tossed into a
nuSHSnnz4cg,172480,174080,pan called a holla there was something
nuSHSnnz4cg,174080,175920,like this i saw in mexico but literally
nuSHSnnz4cg,175920,177920,the opposite this is concave that was
nuSHSnnz4cg,177920,180080,convex
nuSHSnnz4cg,180080,181920,the fried beef bits are tossed into some
nuSHSnnz4cg,181920,183920,traditional egyptian bread along with
nuSHSnnz4cg,183920,184840,fried onions
nuSHSnnz4cg,184840,187680,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,187680,189519,this is our first meal of the day this
nuSHSnnz4cg,189519,191760,is breakfast a bunch of random cow parts
nuSHSnnz4cg,191760,194480,i gotta say i love that unique frying
nuSHSnnz4cg,194480,196480,creation where it has a little pit for
nuSHSnnz4cg,196480,198480,frying and then a big beach around it
nuSHSnnz4cg,198480,200480,for all the food to hang out and dry off
nuSHSnnz4cg,200480,202000,really cool they have all types of
nuSHSnnz4cg,202000,203599,different cow parts here including the
nuSHSnnz4cg,203599,205840,esophagus right here we have the brazen
nuSHSnnz4cg,205840,207519,station you can see they have everything
nuSHSnnz4cg,207519,210080,in there i mean what is that oh okay so
nuSHSnnz4cg,210080,212480,that is the esophagus it looks so
nuSHSnnz4cg,212480,214239,bizarre it's like something from alien i
nuSHSnnz4cg,214239,215360,didn't know how to order it it looked
nuSHSnnz4cg,215360,216959,like they're still cooking it so uh
nuSHSnnz4cg,216959,218799,maybe next time for the esophagus but
nuSHSnnz4cg,218799,220720,here inside of this bread we've got
nuSHSnnz4cg,220720,222560,onions liver sausage and then i think
nuSHSnnz4cg,222560,224239,they put a little bit of face oh take a
nuSHSnnz4cg,224239,225599,look at it this looks real good let's go
nuSHSnnz4cg,225599,227920,for it oh
nuSHSnnz4cg,227920,229200,i have no idea what body part that is
nuSHSnnz4cg,229200,231040,it's quite good actually but super oily
nuSHSnnz4cg,231040,232239,but they have a nice salad on the side
nuSHSnnz4cg,232239,234400,here here we got onions tomatoes chilies
nuSHSnnz4cg,234400,235840,and a little bit of cucumber it's kind
nuSHSnnz4cg,235840,238239,of like a arabic pico de gallo so i'm
nuSHSnnz4cg,238239,239680,gonna use my bread just to pick up some
nuSHSnnz4cg,239680,241519,of that try that out
nuSHSnnz4cg,241519,243040,so this is pretty good it's spicy
nuSHSnnz4cg,243040,244720,refreshing i like it i like it a lot on
nuSHSnnz4cg,244720,247040,this side here that i believe is tahini
nuSHSnnz4cg,247040,249360,tahini a sort of hummus made of sesame
nuSHSnnz4cg,249360,251360,seeds it's found alongside most meals
nuSHSnnz4cg,251360,252799,here i'm gonna just dip a little bit of
nuSHSnnz4cg,252799,255840,my meat in there
nuSHSnnz4cg,255840,257359,it's a bit nutty but it's not my
nuSHSnnz4cg,257359,258799,favorite it's like a salt bomb in your
nuSHSnnz4cg,258799,260880,mouth but here beautiful seasoned beef
nuSHSnnz4cg,260880,262560,sausage with onions on top let's try it
nuSHSnnz4cg,262560,263440,out
nuSHSnnz4cg,263440,265360,it's super rich super fatty but quite
nuSHSnnz4cg,265360,267120,delicious i think what they do here is
nuSHSnnz4cg,267120,268880,they got the bread i'm gonna put the
nuSHSnnz4cg,268880,271040,sausage in there some onion i'm throwing
nuSHSnnz4cg,271040,272560,some of this on there and then i'm gonna
nuSHSnnz4cg,272560,274000,put all that in a little bit of the
nuSHSnnz4cg,274000,275759,tahini
nuSHSnnz4cg,275759,277440,that's delicious it's a lot of powerful
nuSHSnnz4cg,277440,279120,flavors but when you mix them together
nuSHSnnz4cg,279120,280400,it's quite delicious this is a good
nuSHSnnz4cg,280400,281750,breakfast
nuSHSnnz4cg,281750,288420,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,288880,290880,egypt is a muslim majority country which
nuSHSnnz4cg,290880,293280,means most follow a strict halal diet
nuSHSnnz4cg,293280,295919,this means no pork no reptiles or other
nuSHSnnz4cg,295919,297759,animals some might consider extreme
nuSHSnnz4cg,297759,299680,meats but when it comes to the animals
nuSHSnnz4cg,299680,302080,they do eat like lamb while people here
nuSHSnnz4cg,302080,304320,eat everything including the head and
nuSHSnnz4cg,304320,305680,face
nuSHSnnz4cg,305680,307600,behind me a very popular street food
nuSHSnnz4cg,307600,309520,stall here it's all about all the
nuSHSnnz4cg,309520,311039,offcuts from the sheep so you're gonna
nuSHSnnz4cg,311039,313840,see head stomach organs sausage i saw
nuSHSnnz4cg,313840,315840,sausage too the sausage is gigantic by
nuSHSnnz4cg,315840,317360,the way i was very impressed by it not
nuSHSnnz4cg,317360,319680,jealous just impressed
nuSHSnnz4cg,319680,322160,oh my god come take a look so right here
nuSHSnnz4cg,322160,324320,we have just an inordinate amount of
nuSHSnnz4cg,324320,326080,different sheep parts here these lamb
nuSHSnnz4cg,326080,328080,heads are boiled in local spices for
nuSHSnnz4cg,328080,330320,hours until the meat and fats break down
nuSHSnnz4cg,330320,332639,and become incredibly tender i have a
nuSHSnnz4cg,332639,335440,big plate with the sheep head everything
nuSHSnnz4cg,335440,337039,everything although this meat may seem
nuSHSnnz4cg,337039,340240,exotic to some here it's no big deal oh
nuSHSnnz4cg,340240,341440,he just cut me off a little piece of
nuSHSnnz4cg,341440,343680,sausage here that looks awesome there's
nuSHSnnz4cg,343680,347360,tons of rice in there let's try it out
nuSHSnnz4cg,348479,350800,it's spicy and very tomatoey and full of
nuSHSnnz4cg,350800,352940,rice and some animal fat too that's good
nuSHSnnz4cg,352940,356069,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,356400,358080,this is my plate here he's finishing it
nuSHSnnz4cg,358080,359520,right now oh he's put some salt on it
nuSHSnnz4cg,359520,361440,some pepper oh
nuSHSnnz4cg,361440,363199,yes take a look at this so many
nuSHSnnz4cg,363199,365039,different foods time to sit down and eat
nuSHSnnz4cg,365039,367039,let's do it
nuSHSnnz4cg,367039,369280,so far so good no one really seems to
nuSHSnnz4cg,369280,370560,give a crap what we're doing right now
nuSHSnnz4cg,370560,371919,and most of the vendors we've gone to
nuSHSnnz4cg,371919,373120,have been pretty nice this guy was a
nuSHSnnz4cg,373120,374639,little impatient at first until i
nuSHSnnz4cg,374639,376560,dropped a hundred pounds it's like six
nuSHSnnz4cg,376560,378560,dollars and 30 cents and i said hey fill
nuSHSnnz4cg,378560,380160,up a plate that's what he did and he's
nuSHSnnz4cg,380160,381919,been very happy to accommodate any of
nuSHSnnz4cg,381919,384080,our requests ever since here we have a
nuSHSnnz4cg,384080,385919,broth this reminds me of meat that i've
nuSHSnnz4cg,385919,387680,had in mexico where they braised the
nuSHSnnz4cg,387680,389600,meat forever and they take the juice
nuSHSnnz4cg,389600,390960,because when you braise it for a long
nuSHSnnz4cg,390960,392880,time a lot of the fat flavor is going to
nuSHSnnz4cg,392880,394720,go out of the meat and then into the
nuSHSnnz4cg,394720,396560,broth so we have that we have some bread
nuSHSnnz4cg,396560,398319,and there always seems to be some kind
nuSHSnnz4cg,398319,400160,of a little bit of a salad on the side
nuSHSnnz4cg,400160,402400,too all right let's get into it first
nuSHSnnz4cg,402400,404639,this is the tongue i'm gonna rip the
nuSHSnnz4cg,404639,406160,tongue off of here and then i'm gonna
nuSHSnnz4cg,406160,409120,hit it with the lime and try it out
nuSHSnnz4cg,409120,410720,so i mean yet satisfying there's
nuSHSnnz4cg,410720,412400,something about it it's got personality
nuSHSnnz4cg,412400,413680,very nice
nuSHSnnz4cg,413680,415759,all right next let's try the brain here
nuSHSnnz4cg,415759,417919,you can see all the ridges in the brain
nuSHSnnz4cg,417919,419280,you know they say the more ridges you
nuSHSnnz4cg,419280,421120,have the smarter you are so maybe the
nuSHSnnz4cg,421120,422720,sheep knew several languages it was
nuSHSnnz4cg,422720,424560,probably a polyglot
nuSHSnnz4cg,424560,426080,i'm going to put this on the bread and
nuSHSnnz4cg,426080,427680,treat it like a topping for the bread
nuSHSnnz4cg,427680,429360,all right this is my little brain taco
nuSHSnnz4cg,429360,432000,let's try it out
nuSHSnnz4cg,433039,434479,i can't do like an old that's so
nuSHSnnz4cg,434479,436080,delicious yummy face like i just say
nuSHSnnz4cg,436080,437840,delicious scallop or something it is
nuSHSnnz4cg,437840,440479,brains it is creamy it's bold i probably
nuSHSnnz4cg,440479,441840,put too much of it on there if you're
nuSHSnnz4cg,441840,443360,looking to get gout so you can get
nuSHSnnz4cg,443360,445440,disability leave i recommend eating this
nuSHSnnz4cg,445440,446560,every day
nuSHSnnz4cg,446560,448479,i'm gonna try this broth now
nuSHSnnz4cg,448479,451120,oh wow that is muttony you are not a
nuSHSnnz4cg,451120,453280,mutton fan i mean that is pure mutton
nuSHSnnz4cg,453280,455440,distilled down into a juice ah
nuSHSnnz4cg,455440,457199,electrolytes
nuSHSnnz4cg,457199,458080,all right let's see what else they have
nuSHSnnz4cg,458080,460080,in here oh right here this was in
nuSHSnnz4cg,460080,461280,probably the inside of the cheek
nuSHSnnz4cg,461280,463440,somewhere i'm gonna try that
nuSHSnnz4cg,463440,465680,super rich soft tender the thing is
nuSHSnnz4cg,465680,467759,nothing has a ton of flavor here this is
nuSHSnnz4cg,467759,469759,some actual salt you can see uh all the
nuSHSnnz4cg,469759,471440,fingerprints like a crime scene in there
nuSHSnnz4cg,471440,472960,i think people usually put a bit of that
nuSHSnnz4cg,472960,476160,salt onto the meat try it out
nuSHSnnz4cg,476160,477520,this is a tough food for tourists
nuSHSnnz4cg,477520,478960,because if you come here and you don't
nuSHSnnz4cg,478960,480240,know the lay of the land you might walk
nuSHSnnz4cg,480240,481599,away a little bit disappointed or you
nuSHSnnz4cg,481599,482800,might even say this didn't have enough
nuSHSnnz4cg,482800,484240,flavor but there's other flavor
nuSHSnnz4cg,484240,485919,enhancers all around it so you need to
nuSHSnnz4cg,485919,487440,mix and match until you get the right
nuSHSnnz4cg,487440,489440,blend of flavors these are skills that
nuSHSnnz4cg,489440,491199,people here have grown up with they see
nuSHSnnz4cg,491199,492479,their parents how they're mixing and
nuSHSnnz4cg,492479,495080,matching food that's what you gotta do
nuSHSnnz4cg,495080,498250,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,498479,499840,this restaurant brings a whole new
nuSHSnnz4cg,499840,503680,meaning to the word slow and low
nuSHSnnz4cg,504000,505919,this place is called nepha named after
nuSHSnnz4cg,505919,508560,the dish they sell el nagaji named after
nuSHSnnz4cg,508560,510319,the owner who cooks a lamb so
nuSHSnnz4cg,510319,512719,mouth-watering it sells out each day we
nuSHSnnz4cg,512719,514560,have come to our next destination i'm
nuSHSnnz4cg,514560,516320,with the chef right now and take a look
nuSHSnnz4cg,516320,517760,at this this is something completely
nuSHSnnz4cg,517760,519760,magical sheep that's been cooked
nuSHSnnz4cg,519760,521680,underground he's pulling the bones out
nuSHSnnz4cg,521680,523680,now and it's so soft it looks so
nuSHSnnz4cg,523680,524800,delicious look at that that's like a
nuSHSnnz4cg,524800,526480,shoulder blade or something can i have
nuSHSnnz4cg,526480,528720,that i'm gonna pull this meat right off
nuSHSnnz4cg,528720,530959,of the bone oh that looks so juicy take

nuSHSnnz4cg,536880,539120,without any spices or seasonings the
nuSHSnnz4cg,539120,541120,flavors come from the high quality wood
nuSHSnnz4cg,541120,543680,and fresh meat it's cooked low and slow

nuSHSnnz4cg,567440,569279,full of different mutton parts and i
nuSHSnnz4cg,569279,570959,have to say this reminds me so much of
nuSHSnnz4cg,570959,572800,mexico right now there's a few parallels
nuSHSnnz4cg,572800,574720,between this and barbacoa the barbacoa
nuSHSnnz4cg,574720,576720,in mexico they also cook it underground
nuSHSnnz4cg,576720,578080,and they also are famous for kind of
nuSHSnnz4cg,578080,579760,cooking it with no seasonings at all and
nuSHSnnz4cg,579760,580959,that's the same thing they've done here
nuSHSnnz4cg,580959,582880,beyond that in mexico you eat everything
nuSHSnnz4cg,582880,584880,with a tortilla here you eat everything
nuSHSnnz4cg,584880,586160,with egyptian bread it's a very
nuSHSnnz4cg,586160,587600,different part of the world but kind of
nuSHSnnz4cg,587600,590560,a similar recipe
nuSHSnnz4cg,590560,591920,i can't wait to try it out there's so
nuSHSnnz4cg,591920,593440,many yummy looking pieces here right in
nuSHSnnz4cg,593440,595360,the middle take a look this is a bunch
nuSHSnnz4cg,595360,596800,of different types of meat but that is
nuSHSnnz4cg,596800,598800,still steaming hot it's shiny it looks
nuSHSnnz4cg,598800,600320,like it put on some baby oil and went to
nuSHSnnz4cg,600320,603200,the beach let's try it out
nuSHSnnz4cg,603200,604959,that is so good and so rich so
nuSHSnnz4cg,604959,606160,incredibly heavy that's why they have
nuSHSnnz4cg,606160,607760,this here this is a salad and it cuts
nuSHSnnz4cg,607760,609040,through the heaviness a little bit but
nuSHSnnz4cg,609040,611120,they also have this here this is called
nuSHSnnz4cg,611120,613200,salad dressing water some people also
nuSHSnnz4cg,613200,615360,call it egyptian whiskey the fact is it
nuSHSnnz4cg,615360,617279,is zero percent alcohol which is
nuSHSnnz4cg,617279,619740,unfortunate but i'll try it anyways
nuSHSnnz4cg,619740,622160,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,622160,624000,oh it might as well get you drunk it's
nuSHSnnz4cg,624000,625920,basically like vinegar chili powder
nuSHSnnz4cg,625920,628560,chilies maybe salt is really tense tense
nuSHSnnz4cg,628560,630399,and intense
nuSHSnnz4cg,630399,632079,then we have right here the bread i'm
nuSHSnnz4cg,632079,633519,going to make myself a little bit of an
nuSHSnnz4cg,633519,635519,egyptian barbacoa taco i'm going to open
nuSHSnnz4cg,635519,637120,this up and i'm going to start layering
nuSHSnnz4cg,637120,638959,in some meat throw some herbs on there
nuSHSnnz4cg,638959,642560,then the tahini here we go
nuSHSnnz4cg,642640,644320,and you're like oh man this is one of my
nuSHSnnz4cg,644320,645680,favorite things i've eaten so far in
nuSHSnnz4cg,645680,647680,this country super soft bread really
nuSHSnnz4cg,647680,650240,flavorful natural tasting lamb and then
nuSHSnnz4cg,650240,652320,maybe adding a touch of salt from the
nuSHSnnz4cg,652320,656000,tahini and that is perfection i love it
nuSHSnnz4cg,656000,657920,before we move on there's one more dish
nuSHSnnz4cg,657920,660399,the chef insists i try boiled lamb
nuSHSnnz4cg,660399,662800,testicles this is what the owner calls
nuSHSnnz4cg,662800,664560,viagra it's funny right because you come
nuSHSnnz4cg,664560,666079,to an arabic country you think maybe
nuSHSnnz4cg,666079,668320,people are very conservative um not
nuSHSnnz4cg,668320,670720,always oh they feel really gooey and
nuSHSnnz4cg,670720,672640,fatty he said i toss it back and i'll be
nuSHSnnz4cg,672640,674800,like a young virile man again here we go
nuSHSnnz4cg,674800,678880,one shot of full sheet testicle
nuSHSnnz4cg,681279,683360,it really just tastes like testicle soup
nuSHSnnz4cg,683360,684720,do you think i could say chicken no it's
nuSHSnnz4cg,684720,686320,nothing like chicken not at all it's
nuSHSnnz4cg,686320,689200,padding going savory it's like kind of
nuSHSnnz4cg,689200,691120,soupy a bit i'm worried about having two
nuSHSnnz4cg,691120,692720,maybe i'll have too much power my wife's
nuSHSnnz4cg,692720,695710,not here she can get a visa
nuSHSnnz4cg,695710,699339,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,704640,706399,right now we're going to the very top of
nuSHSnnz4cg,706399,708560,a building a rooftop here in cairo
nuSHSnnz4cg,708560,709839,there's not a lot of space but they've
nuSHSnnz4cg,709839,711440,got rooftops and here they keep
nuSHSnnz4cg,711440,715900,something very special let me show you
nuSHSnnz4cg,715900,719680,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,719680,720760,oh my gosh
nuSHSnnz4cg,720760,724700,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,725040,728399,i regret this immediately
nuSHSnnz4cg,728839,733040,oh i just had a good idea
nuSHSnnz4cg,733200,735120,allow me to introduce you to the cairo
nuSHSnnz4cg,735120,737519,craft of bird keeping in here there must
nuSHSnnz4cg,737519,739920,be 50 or so pigeons it's a crapload of
nuSHSnnz4cg,739920,741279,pigeons and actually speaking of a
nuSHSnnz4cg,741279,743120,crapload look down here it's a load of
nuSHSnnz4cg,743120,745120,crap
nuSHSnnz4cg,745120,746880,in this city it's not uncommon to see
nuSHSnnz4cg,746880,749360,men standing on rooftops waving a flag
nuSHSnnz4cg,749360,752639,and corralling their pigeons
nuSHSnnz4cg,752800,754480,that's because around once a day the
nuSHSnnz4cg,754480,756240,birds are released and allowed to fly
nuSHSnnz4cg,756240,758639,freely to get some exercise oh my god
nuSHSnnz4cg,758639,762240,it's happening yeah go go go wow this is
nuSHSnnz4cg,762240,763839,wild
nuSHSnnz4cg,763839,765760,to communicate with the pigeons the bird
nuSHSnnz4cg,765760,768000,keeper uses a complex series of whistles
nuSHSnnz4cg,768000,769760,and gestures signaling whether they
nuSHSnnz4cg,769760,772480,should fly higher or come home
nuSHSnnz4cg,772480,774540,amazingly they always return
nuSHSnnz4cg,774540,776000,[Music]
nuSHSnnz4cg,776000,777920,sometimes the bird keepers will have one
nuSHSnnz4cg,777920,781440,bird less and sometimes one bird more
nuSHSnnz4cg,781440,783440,as you can see people here really love
nuSHSnnz4cg,783440,785040,their pigeons whether they look like
nuSHSnnz4cg,785040,786630,this or like this
nuSHSnnz4cg,786630,788320,[Music]

nuSHSnnz4cg,1071679,1073039,earlier i'm not gonna try that yet
nuSHSnnz4cg,1073039,1074720,because it's meant to be tried with this
nuSHSnnz4cg,1074720,1076880,this is tomato on top of rice it's
nuSHSnnz4cg,1076880,1079200,almost like a chunky marinara this white
nuSHSnnz4cg,1079200,1080640,rice is supposed to mix with the green
nuSHSnnz4cg,1080640,1081919,stuff here let's see how this goes
nuSHSnnz4cg,1081919,1084240,because this is borderline slimy it
