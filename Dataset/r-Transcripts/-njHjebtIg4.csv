-njHjebtIg4,61,2390,(upbeat music)
-njHjebtIg4,2390,3630,"- Hey, what's up, MKBHD here."
-njHjebtIg4,3630,4463,You know tech companies
-njHjebtIg4,4463,6790,"straight up lie to us sometimes, right?"
-njHjebtIg4,6790,8960,"Like there's, now there's different types of lies"
-njHjebtIg4,8960,10450,and there's definitely different levels to this.
-njHjebtIg4,10450,14410,"Honestly, most of it is harmless, but it is fascinating."
-njHjebtIg4,14410,16800,And I think you might be surprised by how much stuff
-njHjebtIg4,16800,20560,we might take for granted that's not actually real.
-njHjebtIg4,20560,23010,"So I and many other very optimistic people,"
-njHjebtIg4,23010,25590,have been waiting for the new Tesla Roadster
-njHjebtIg4,25590,29210,to be the first reasonable two-door electric sports car
-njHjebtIg4,29210,32930,ever since it was unveiled five years ago in 2017.
-njHjebtIg4,32930,34260,Can you believe it's been five years?
-njHjebtIg4,34260,37480,"They originally said it will come out in 2020,"
-njHjebtIg4,37480,39310,and then 2020 came and went
-njHjebtIg4,39310,40400,"and it was a bit of a weird year,"
-njHjebtIg4,40400,43250,"so then 2021 happened, still nothing."
-njHjebtIg4,43250,45580,"Now 2022, this car is probably not coming out"
-njHjebtIg4,45580,47360,until 2024 at least.
-njHjebtIg4,47360,48970,"But you know, maybe that's not a lie."
-njHjebtIg4,48970,50450,"You know, that's something they were actually trying"
-njHjebtIg4,50450,55290,"and hoping to achieve and then it got delayed a while, fine."
-njHjebtIg4,55290,56850,But there were a lot of other little things
-njHjebtIg4,56850,59670,Elon said on stage that night
-njHjebtIg4,59670,63239,"that were, let's just say clever ways"
-njHjebtIg4,63240,65180,of framing certain information.
-njHjebtIg4,65180,66380,- The new Tesla Roadster
-njHjebtIg4,68320,73320,"will be the fastest production car ever made, period."
-njHjebtIg4,73620,75520,Zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds.
-njHjebtIg4,75520,77880,This will be the first time that any car
-njHjebtIg4,77880,80729,has broken two seconds at 0 to 60.
-njHjebtIg4,80730,83480,- So that actually turned out to be untrue
-njHjebtIg4,83480,85860,because Plaid Model S came out last year
-njHjebtIg4,85860,88380,and it also has a sub two seconds 0 to 60.
-njHjebtIg4,88380,90350,But these 0 to 60s
-njHjebtIg4,90350,94220,"should have a little asterisk up in the corner next to it,"
-njHjebtIg4,94220,98260,because they are with something called rollout subtracted.
-njHjebtIg4,98260,100410,"So Tesla's triple motor Plaid Model S,"
-njHjebtIg4,100410,104620,"is listed at a 1.99 seconds, 0 to 60."
-njHjebtIg4,104620,107370,"And at least that one does have an asterisk on the side,"
-njHjebtIg4,107370,110460,with the asterisk meaning with rollout subtracted.
-njHjebtIg4,110460,113250,So certain performance cars list those 0 to 60 time
-njHjebtIg4,113250,115220,"with a one foot of subtracted rollout,"
-njHjebtIg4,115220,116440,"which might sound a little weird,"
-njHjebtIg4,116440,119810,but this is a metric that comes from the drag racing world.
-njHjebtIg4,119810,122240,"Basically when a car lines up to do the 0 to 60 test,"
-njHjebtIg4,122240,123130,"or a drag test,"
-njHjebtIg4,123130,125070,it's measuring whether or not you've started
-njHjebtIg4,125070,127970,by whether or not your tire has broken the light beams
-njHjebtIg4,127970,129380,across the starting line.
-njHjebtIg4,129380,130929,So there's one pre-staging light
-njHjebtIg4,130929,133819,and one staging lights seven inches later.
-njHjebtIg4,133820,135600,The clock starts
-njHjebtIg4,135600,138410,"when the tires are no longer breaking that plane,"
-njHjebtIg4,138410,141150,but there is a small bit of speed gathered
-njHjebtIg4,141150,142840,as the car launches
-njHjebtIg4,142840,146129,before it stops blocking that first light.
-njHjebtIg4,146130,149520,"And then the second light, that is the one foot rollout."
-njHjebtIg4,149520,152230,A fast car can reach five to six miles an hour
-njHjebtIg4,152230,153769,"in that one foot rollout,"
-njHjebtIg4,153770,156400,which cuts through reported 0 to 60 time
-njHjebtIg4,156400,158799,anywhere from 0.2 to 0.3 seconds.
-njHjebtIg4,158800,162260,"That's actually a bigger gap, the harder the car launches."
-njHjebtIg4,162260,165019,"So every real world test of the Model S,"
-njHjebtIg4,165020,168800,"of people on the street going from 0 to 60,"
-njHjebtIg4,168800,171120,"or even on drag strip 0 to 60,"
-njHjebtIg4,171120,176049,"it's always been measured at like 2.15 to 2.25 seconds,"
-njHjebtIg4,176050,178990,which is still absolutely ridiculous.
-njHjebtIg4,178990,180480,"But by measuring with one foot rollout,"
-njHjebtIg4,180480,183670,Tesla was able to achieve 1.99 seconds.
-njHjebtIg4,183670,185330,I assume they achieved it at least one time
-njHjebtIg4,185330,187230,"in order for them to put it on their website,"
-njHjebtIg4,187230,189769,because that's a way cooler headline
-njHjebtIg4,189770,191823,"and a way more impressive stat,"
-njHjebtIg4,192680,195109,but that should have the asterisk next to it.
-njHjebtIg4,195110,197180,And I assume the Tesla Roadster's time
-njHjebtIg4,197180,199379,"was also measured with one foot rollout,"
-njHjebtIg4,199380,200500,but it doesn't have the asterisk.
-njHjebtIg4,200500,202393,So is that a lie?
-njHjebtIg4,203250,206210,"Well, no, but they also don't do that with their other cars."
-njHjebtIg4,206210,208560,Like the Model 3 and Model Y are listed
-njHjebtIg4,208560,212520,"with honest 0 to 60 times, no rollout subtracted."
-njHjebtIg4,212520,215590,So that number can be a little deceiving
-njHjebtIg4,215590,217120,without the extra context.
-njHjebtIg4,217120,219769,"- As I said, torque coming out of our battery pack,"
-njHjebtIg4,219770,221361,"10,000 Newton-meters of torque."
-njHjebtIg4,221361,223293,"If you know what that means, it's stupid."
-njHjebtIg4,224280,227110,"- So that 10,000 Newton-meters of torque is another one."
-njHjebtIg4,227110,229000,That's a pretty absurd number.
-njHjebtIg4,229000,230490,Not that people are buying sports cars
-njHjebtIg4,230490,231930,"just for the torque number,"
-njHjebtIg4,231930,236530,"but that translates to about 7,400 pound feet of torque,"
-njHjebtIg4,236530,238459,which is just ridiculous.
-njHjebtIg4,238460,240970,"For context, here's how that would line up with some cars"
-njHjebtIg4,240970,241803,"you may recognize,"
-njHjebtIg4,241803,245329,some of the most famous fastest cars ever made.
-njHjebtIg4,245330,247110,Seems a little hard to believe
-njHjebtIg4,247110,249050,"that they're this far out in front, right?"
-njHjebtIg4,249050,251080,But torque is one of those numbers and metrics
-njHjebtIg4,251080,252610,that's been around for a long time.
-njHjebtIg4,252610,255580,And it's a little bit different in gas cars
-njHjebtIg4,255580,256680,versus electric cars.
-njHjebtIg4,256680,259370,So it was explained so eloquently by Donut Media.
-njHjebtIg4,259370,261400,I'm gonna link their video about that below the like button.
-njHjebtIg4,261400,264360,Torque is a measurement of turning force.
-njHjebtIg4,264360,265193,"And in this case,"
-njHjebtIg4,265193,268300,the force being applied by the engine is turning the wheels.
-njHjebtIg4,268300,270360,So when manufacturers list the horsepower
-njHjebtIg4,270360,271680,"and the torque of a car,"
-njHjebtIg4,271680,273410,they typically list the torque
-njHjebtIg4,273410,275550,right at the engine crankshaft.
-njHjebtIg4,275550,276960,But by the time it gets to the wheels
-njHjebtIg4,276960,278870,"with parasitic losses of the drive train,"
-njHjebtIg4,278870,279930,it's a lower number.
-njHjebtIg4,279930,281060,"Same thing with torque,"
-njHjebtIg4,281060,283930,which also gets multiplied by the gear ratios
-njHjebtIg4,283930,284763,in the drive train.
-njHjebtIg4,284763,287560,But electric cars don't have all those gears.
-njHjebtIg4,287560,289290,They have what's called direct drive.
-njHjebtIg4,289290,292630,And so they make a lot of torque through one large gear.
-njHjebtIg4,292630,293740,"So after multiplication,"
-njHjebtIg4,293740,296479,the number is much more impressive from the wheels
-njHjebtIg4,296480,298640,than from the crankshaft at the motors.
-njHjebtIg4,298640,301180,So they've chosen to report wheel torque.
-njHjebtIg4,301180,304949,"So the 10,000 Newton-meter number that Elon said"
-njHjebtIg4,304950,308130,"for the Roadster, is likely perfectly legit."
-njHjebtIg4,308130,308970,Very real.
-njHjebtIg4,308970,310160,It's not a lie.
-njHjebtIg4,310160,312430,It's just this new number is a little deceiving
-njHjebtIg4,312430,315229,without the context that it's a different measurement
-njHjebtIg4,315230,316710,of torque from what we've gotten
-njHjebtIg4,316710,318819,from every other gas car for decades.
-njHjebtIg4,318820,321800,"Just a little extra word there, wheel torque."
-njHjebtIg4,321800,322633,Makes a big difference.
-njHjebtIg4,322633,323810,"And this isn't just Tesla, by the way,"
-njHjebtIg4,323810,326970,"this is the same thing happened with the Hummer EV,"
-njHjebtIg4,326970,328010,which got announced
-njHjebtIg4,328010,331360,"that it would have 11,500 pound feet of torque."
-njHjebtIg4,331360,333650,"But as Engineering Explained also pointed this out,"
-njHjebtIg4,333650,336699,"when you divide by the gear ratios of each of the motors,"
-njHjebtIg4,336700,339710,you end up at about a thousand pound feet of torque
-njHjebtIg4,339710,341780,"at the motors, the way it's normally reported."
-njHjebtIg4,341780,344380,"But look, let's shift gears a bit, pun intended."
-njHjebtIg4,344380,345610,"Because you know, at least we're talking about"
-njHjebtIg4,345610,346530,real products.
-njHjebtIg4,346530,348340,"What Teslas and Hummers are gonna ship,"
-njHjebtIg4,348340,351770,they're eventually real and that's great.
-njHjebtIg4,351770,355349,"And on the other side of that spectrum, is vaporware."
-njHjebtIg4,355350,359030,"So vaporware is defined as a product that's been advertised,"
-njHjebtIg4,359030,360810,but is not yet available to buy
-njHjebtIg4,360810,363070,either because it's only a concept
-njHjebtIg4,363070,366430,or because it's still being written or designed or built.
-njHjebtIg4,366430,368873,So is vaporware a lie?
-njHjebtIg4,369960,372039,"I mean, there's lots of vaporware everywhere."
-njHjebtIg4,372040,374460,"I mean, from Sony's concept car at CES"
-njHjebtIg4,374460,377539,"that I'm telling you is never going to ship as is,"
-njHjebtIg4,377540,382540,to a BMW's color-changing iX from CES with the ink exterior.
-njHjebtIg4,383400,384729,"It looks so sick,"
-njHjebtIg4,384730,388260,but I think we all know that's not going to be a real car
-njHjebtIg4,388260,389120,"that we can buy,"
-njHjebtIg4,389120,390919,but then there are also some real products
-njHjebtIg4,390920,394530,"that companies announce with the intention of making them,"
-njHjebtIg4,394530,396980,and then things go a little sideways.
-njHjebtIg4,396980,400320,Like do you remember Samsung's Bixby enabled speaker
-njHjebtIg4,400320,403150,called Galaxy Home that looked like a barbecue grill?
-njHjebtIg4,403150,406000,"That was announced in 2018,"
-njHjebtIg4,406000,408260,then a year went by nothing shipped.
-njHjebtIg4,408260,411130,"In 2019, there are people that started poking Samsung"
-njHjebtIg4,411130,413120,and they had to come out and confirm with a statement
-njHjebtIg4,413120,416050,"that it wasn't canceled yet, they're still working on it,"
-njHjebtIg4,416050,417360,"but then in 2020,"
-njHjebtIg4,417360,420409,Samsung quietly removed all of the coming soon verbiage
-njHjebtIg4,420410,421920,from their site and wouldn't respond
-njHjebtIg4,421920,423680,with any official statements about it.
-njHjebtIg4,423680,426490,So they're probably hoping we forgot about that one.
-njHjebtIg4,426490,428080,Or how about AirPower?
-njHjebtIg4,428080,429930,Apple spent a few minutes on stage
-njHjebtIg4,429930,431870,"raving about this new product,"
-njHjebtIg4,431870,434070,"a charging mat that would charge your phone,"
-njHjebtIg4,434070,436660,"and your watch and your AirPods all at once,"
-njHjebtIg4,436660,439080,and it was to be the future of charging.
-njHjebtIg4,439080,442289,"- This is not possible with current standards,"
-njHjebtIg4,442290,443820,but our team knows how to do this.
-njHjebtIg4,443820,446580,"- Yeah, they didn't, they didn't."
-njHjebtIg4,446580,447699,Probably the biggest red flag
-njHjebtIg4,447700,448970,"was that at the actual event,"
-njHjebtIg4,448970,451210,they had a single non-working dummy unit
-njHjebtIg4,451210,452620,"in the hands-on area,"
-njHjebtIg4,452620,455389,"and then everybody left and went home,"
-njHjebtIg4,455390,458380,and AirPower just kind of quietly disappeared.
-njHjebtIg4,458380,461530,Nobody ever saw or heard about AirPower again.
-njHjebtIg4,461530,464850,Eventually the AirPower project was officially canceled
-njHjebtIg4,464850,465683,by Apple.
-njHjebtIg4,465683,468300,I explained why that disappeared with the video up here
-njHjebtIg4,468300,469960,that you can click or it's linked below
-njHjebtIg4,469960,470819,if you wanna watch that.
-njHjebtIg4,470820,474220,But I think the strangest tech company lies though
-njHjebtIg4,474220,477330,come from industry standards or terms
-njHjebtIg4,477330,479900,"that are just straight up outdated,"
-njHjebtIg4,479900,480960,because that's just the way they are.
-njHjebtIg4,480960,482900,They're not even lying on purpose.
-njHjebtIg4,482900,487639,And most of these come from the photo video industry.
-njHjebtIg4,487640,488950,"And I don't just mean how someone might say,"
-njHjebtIg4,488950,490340,"oh, we're filming something,"
-njHjebtIg4,490340,492710,"when really there's no film anymore, we're recording."
-njHjebtIg4,492710,494990,Or if somebody doesn't know
-njHjebtIg4,494990,497050,because they're too young that the save button
-njHjebtIg4,497050,499360,"is based on a real physical floppy drive,"
-njHjebtIg4,499360,501530,"it used to be an actual thing you could carry,"
-njHjebtIg4,501530,502510,it goes deeper than that.
-njHjebtIg4,502510,505040,"For example, the one inch sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,505040,507070,might have heard a lot about it.
-njHjebtIg4,507070,508750,It's not one inch.
-njHjebtIg4,508750,510270,"It's not one inch vertically,"
-njHjebtIg4,510270,511910,"it's not one inch horizontally,"
-njHjebtIg4,511910,513650,"it's not one inch diagonally,"
-njHjebtIg4,513650,516323,no part of a one inch sensor is actually one inch.
-njHjebtIg4,516323,518620,And you might've seen that point and shoots
-njHjebtIg4,518620,520089,like Sony's RX 100
-njHjebtIg4,520090,522200,"famously use a one inch sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,522200,524159,or that there's even a couple of new smartphones popping up
-njHjebtIg4,524159,526949,"like the Sharp Aquos, or Leica smartphone,"
-njHjebtIg4,526950,531210,or the Sony Xperia Pro-I that have huge one inch sensors.
-njHjebtIg4,531210,533390,But despite all the headlines and all the articles
-njHjebtIg4,533390,535190,"and titles and captions and tweets,"
-njHjebtIg4,535190,536670,"and anything else you might read,"
-njHjebtIg4,536670,538620,if you're thinking that a one inch sensor
-njHjebtIg4,538620,541573,"refers to a one inch measurement in any way,"
-njHjebtIg4,542480,543430,"then you'd be wrong,"
-njHjebtIg4,543430,544839,just like I was when I first found this.
-njHjebtIg4,544840,547710,So it turns out a one inch sensors dimensions
-njHjebtIg4,547710,551680,are about 13.2 millimeters by 8.8 millimeters.
-njHjebtIg4,551680,552800,"Now, if you're not already annoyed"
-njHjebtIg4,552800,554830,"by switching between imperial and metric,"
-njHjebtIg4,554830,556930,you've realized that that's less than an inch
-njHjebtIg4,556930,557870,in both directions.
-njHjebtIg4,557870,559100,But what about the diagonal?
-njHjebtIg4,559100,560600,"Well, with a little Pythagorean theorem,"
-njHjebtIg4,560600,563889,"that calculates out to 15.9 millimeters,"
-njHjebtIg4,563890,565580,which is also not one inch.
-njHjebtIg4,565580,566700,So how did we get here?
-njHjebtIg4,566700,568870,How is this a one inch sensor?
-njHjebtIg4,568870,572660,"Well, if you go back to the beginnings of video recording,"
-njHjebtIg4,572660,576230,these earliest cameras were vacuum tube cameras.
-njHjebtIg4,576230,580010,"So just like old CRT TVs use cathode ray tubes,"
-njHjebtIg4,580010,583210,"the earliest TV cameras instead of a digital sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,583210,586660,had physical tubes with a lens at the front
-njHjebtIg4,586660,589449,"and electronics inside them to capture photons,"
-njHjebtIg4,589450,590360,to capture light.
-njHjebtIg4,590360,593360,"So the bigger the tube, the more light it could capture."
-njHjebtIg4,593360,595610,It would redirect all that light to a sensitive piece
-njHjebtIg4,595610,596560,"inside the tube,"
-njHjebtIg4,596560,600200,"and at the time, people would refer to the size of the tube"
-njHjebtIg4,600200,601610,by the diameter of the tube.
-njHjebtIg4,601610,604790,"So when we started using one inch diameter tubes,"
-njHjebtIg4,604790,606880,the sensitive piece inside those
-njHjebtIg4,606880,609770,had gotten to about 13 by 8 millimeters.
-njHjebtIg4,609770,611400,"So fast forward, 50 plus years,"
-njHjebtIg4,611400,614150,here we are today with these amazing digital sensors
-njHjebtIg4,614150,614983,"and all this new equipment,"
-njHjebtIg4,614983,618850,"but today still we refer to the size of the sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,618850,623040,"not by the actual measurement of the sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,623040,628040,but by the measurement of the hypothetical tube diameter
-njHjebtIg4,628500,631990,that would be needed to fit the sensor
-njHjebtIg4,631990,633523,of today's current size.
-njHjebtIg4,634850,637600,"Wow, so today we have one inch sensors."
-njHjebtIg4,637600,638889,They're called one inch sensors
-njHjebtIg4,638890,641420,because the diameter of the tube
-njHjebtIg4,641420,644420,"that would fit a sensor that's 0.63 inches diagonally,"
-njHjebtIg4,644420,648320,"would be a one inch tube, but it's a 0.63 inch sensor."
-njHjebtIg4,648320,651640,So that actually means all of the other sensor measurements
-njHjebtIg4,651640,653550,"that you have relative to one inch,"
-njHjebtIg4,653550,657250,are also relative to this hypothetical inch.
-njHjebtIg4,657250,659760,"So the half-inch sensor, isn't half an inch,"
-njHjebtIg4,659760,663640,it's half of the hypothetical one inch sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,663640,666750,"So is it a lie when these companies say that their products,"
-njHjebtIg4,666750,668883,their cameras have a one inch sensor?
-njHjebtIg4,670710,674310,"Yes and no, and no, if you know what they're talking about."
-njHjebtIg4,674310,676560,"Even if it is a lie though, it is a pretty harmless lie,"
-njHjebtIg4,676560,679900,"because one inch sensor is still pretty big sensor, yeah?"
-njHjebtIg4,679900,681640,But there are all kinds of products that have come out
-njHjebtIg4,681640,684860,where the big selling feature is the one inch sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,684860,687980,Like you might remember the DJI Air 2S drone
-njHjebtIg4,687980,689029,when it was unveiled.
-njHjebtIg4,689030,690740,The spec sheet on Hasselblad site
-njHjebtIg4,690740,693200,"and on DJI site, and all the articles,"
-njHjebtIg4,693200,695100,"it all says one inch sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,695100,697139,like that's a one inch sensor guys.
-njHjebtIg4,697140,700680,Or maybe take the Insta360 One R.
-njHjebtIg4,700680,704020,"You can pay extra money for a one inch edition,"
-njHjebtIg4,704020,707260,"which is a 5K capable, one inch sensor."
-njHjebtIg4,707260,708830,One inch sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,708830,710290,One inch sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,710290,711123,"Like every headline,"
-njHjebtIg4,711123,713550,"I can remember seeing about the Sony Xperia Pro-I,"
-njHjebtIg4,713550,716920,"this crazy new smartphone, mentioned the one inch sensor."
-njHjebtIg4,716920,718740,"And even my video, guilty,"
-njHjebtIg4,718740,721480,"talks about how they're using a one inch sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,721480,724980,which at no point actually says the real dimensions
-njHjebtIg4,724980,725813,of the sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,725813,728060,Now Sony makes most of these actual sensors
-njHjebtIg4,728060,728893,"we're talking about,"
-njHjebtIg4,728893,730650,and Sony's own website for this phone
-njHjebtIg4,730650,733020,"says it has a one inch sensor,"
-njHjebtIg4,733020,735760,"but wait, there's a little asterisk."
-njHjebtIg4,735760,739010,And if you scroll all the way down
-njHjebtIg4,739010,740960,"and read into what that actually stands for,"
-njHjebtIg4,740960,743420,"it turns out it's a one inch,"
-njHjebtIg4,743420,746333,1.0 type Sony image sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,747400,748580,"See, it is a pretty big ask"
-njHjebtIg4,748580,750380,to ask the entire photography industry
-njHjebtIg4,750380,752330,"to redefine sensor sizes,"
-njHjebtIg4,752330,754480,but that is probably how we should be referring
-njHjebtIg4,754480,757620,"to these sensors as 1.0 type sensors,"
-njHjebtIg4,757620,760900,"because they're not actually one inch sensors,"
-njHjebtIg4,760900,764020,"but you know, Sony's own website uses both terms"
-njHjebtIg4,764020,765410,at any given point interchangeably
-njHjebtIg4,765410,767319,to refer to the size of the sensor.
-njHjebtIg4,767320,768840,"And I think if you ask these companies,"
-njHjebtIg4,768840,770490,they'd probably like to have you believe
-njHjebtIg4,770490,772520,that they're one inch diagonal sensors.
-njHjebtIg4,772520,776640,"If they never clarify, then maybe that's a lie by emission."
-njHjebtIg4,776640,777810,"I don't know, how do you feel about that?"
-njHjebtIg4,777810,779730,"Part of my job as a reviewer, I think,"
-njHjebtIg4,779730,783019,is to sort through all of these statements
-njHjebtIg4,783020,785520,from companies that get made all the time
-njHjebtIg4,785520,788870,"and one, figure out how real they are,"
-njHjebtIg4,788870,790839,"and then two, if they're not real,"
-njHjebtIg4,790840,795840,"find out how harmless or harmful is that lie,"
-njHjebtIg4,796103,798170,because it's definitely a spectrum.
-njHjebtIg4,798170,799560,I remember when there was this huge uproar
-njHjebtIg4,799560,801570,"about transparent backed phones,"
-njHjebtIg4,801570,803470,where you could kind of see through the back of the phone
-njHjebtIg4,803470,805149,and some of the components inside.
-njHjebtIg4,805150,807150,"And it was this really cool nerdy design,"
-njHjebtIg4,807150,809680,but it turned out this was just a sticker.
-njHjebtIg4,809680,811600,"And the components that you were looking at,"
-njHjebtIg4,811600,814769,weren't really the working parts of the phone
-njHjebtIg4,814770,816120,they'd led you to believe they were.
-njHjebtIg4,816120,817640,So is that a lie?
-njHjebtIg4,817640,820700,"Yeah, totally, but it did feel pretty harmless."
-njHjebtIg4,820700,823390,Like the whole point of having the transparent back look
-njHjebtIg4,823390,825080,is just to look kind of cool and nerdy
-njHjebtIg4,825080,827040,and it still did accomplish that.
-njHjebtIg4,827040,829589,So I felt like that wasn't something that was a huge deal.
-njHjebtIg4,829590,831240,"But on the other side of the spectrum,"
-njHjebtIg4,831240,833250,companies will actively try to trick you.
-njHjebtIg4,833250,835320,And there is harmful versions of lies.
-njHjebtIg4,835320,837910,"There's stuff like vaporware,"
-njHjebtIg4,837910,840000,"there's stuff like, I don't know, Walway,"
-njHjebtIg4,840000,841700,when they started lying about photos
-njHjebtIg4,841700,844380,"to claim that they were taken with their newest smartphone,"
-njHjebtIg4,844380,846380,but then they were caught multiple times
-njHjebtIg4,846380,848880,taking it with a DSLR or a bigger camera.
-njHjebtIg4,848880,850160,That is misleading.
-njHjebtIg4,850160,851970,That is potentially harmful
-njHjebtIg4,851970,854110,"to a customer that thinks they're gonna get one thing,"
-njHjebtIg4,854110,855450,but then doesn't.
-njHjebtIg4,855450,856810,"So I point that out,"
-njHjebtIg4,856810,857643,"and hopefully,"
-njHjebtIg4,857643,860970,"we can all make more informed decisions together that way,"
-njHjebtIg4,860970,862680,and everybody wins.
-njHjebtIg4,862680,863990,Thanks for watching.
-njHjebtIg4,863990,865580,Catch you guys in the next one.
-njHjebtIg4,865580,866413,Peace.
