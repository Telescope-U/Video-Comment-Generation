Q980C74SdYQ,96370,102250,[Music]
Q980C74SdYQ,102250,104509,I'm trying to illustrate a point here
Q980C74SdYQ,104509,105380,which is that it rains a
Q980C74SdYQ,105380,107000,disproportionate amount of days in New
Q980C74SdYQ,107000,109340,York City but as I'm making charging and
Q980C74SdYQ,109340,111140,looking at the data I'm realizing it
Q980C74SdYQ,111140,114379,rains on average 11 to 15 percent of the
Q980C74SdYQ,114379,116899,days kind of making me feel like a
Q980C74SdYQ,116899,118939,little bit of a spur complaining about
Q980C74SdYQ,118939,120560,it so much maybe I should have looked
Q980C74SdYQ,120560,123079,this up before I did this whole scene so
Q980C74SdYQ,123079,129229,is it pouring and outside was it pouring
Q980C74SdYQ,129229,130729,rain outside today seems like an
Q980C74SdYQ,130729,132680,opportune day to make a video I've
Q980C74SdYQ,132680,134019,wanted to make for a very long time
Q980C74SdYQ,134019,138170,called I wanted to explain to you the
Q980C74SdYQ,138170,140660,audience exactly how I make my vlogs
Q980C74SdYQ,140660,144019,like what I see as the recipe for
Q980C74SdYQ,144019,151010,creating these videos first a quick
Q980C74SdYQ,151010,153410,history lesson I started vlogging in
Q980C74SdYQ,153410,157130,March of 2015 now before I started
Q980C74SdYQ,157130,159019,vlogging vlogging was typically
Q980C74SdYQ,159019,161000,individuals Karen like point-and-shoot
Q980C74SdYQ,161000,162950,cameras there were sort of documenting
Q980C74SdYQ,162950,165319,their day into a camera there was a much
Q980C74SdYQ,165319,167510,smaller genre back then and it was
Q980C74SdYQ,167510,170030,pretty linear day begins here day ends
Q980C74SdYQ,170030,170480,there
Q980C74SdYQ,170480,172579,come with me throughout my day I found
Q980C74SdYQ,172579,174440,the genre fascinating I was obsessed
Q980C74SdYQ,174440,176690,with like Ben Brown I was obsessed with
Q980C74SdYQ,176690,179599,fun for Louie I was obsessed with bf
Q980C74SdYQ,179599,182239,versus GF Charles Trippy was great I
Q980C74SdYQ,182239,183859,think what fascinated me the most about
Q980C74SdYQ,183859,185690,the horizontal is the idea of using your
Q980C74SdYQ,185690,188810,your life as a narrative for a daily
Q980C74SdYQ,188810,192889,series now when I made my HBO series
Q980C74SdYQ,192889,194569,this is a series I did my big brother
Q980C74SdYQ,194569,196760,van it was on HBO in 2010 we made it in
Q980C74SdYQ,196760,199370,2008 that's 10 years ago my brother and
Q980C74SdYQ,199370,202010,I used our lives as a backdrop for a TV
Q980C74SdYQ,202010,204260,show but it wasn't so daily it wasn't so
Q980C74SdYQ,204260,205910,episodic instead we kind of plucked
Q980C74SdYQ,205910,207829,interestingness out of our lives
Q980C74SdYQ,207829,209269,share that interestingness is tiny
Q980C74SdYQ,209269,211010,little stories struggle
Q980C74SdYQ,211010,213019,stories together and call that a TV show
Q980C74SdYQ,213019,215150,episode so I'm one end of the spectrum
Q980C74SdYQ,215150,217420,we've got your daily vloggers in
Q980C74SdYQ,217420,220159,2014-2015 sharing every aspect of their
Q980C74SdYQ,220159,222019,daily lives into a camera and on the
Q980C74SdYQ,222019,223280,other end of the spectrum we got this TV
Q980C74SdYQ,223280,225319,show that I made a decade ago where I
Q980C74SdYQ,225319,226790,share our little stories from my lives
Q980C74SdYQ,226790,229970,as short movies so I went to Belgium in
Q980C74SdYQ,229970,231709,2015 this is a month before I started
Q980C74SdYQ,231709,233659,vlogging and I wanted to test that one
Q980C74SdYQ,233659,235159,thing what would happen if I sort of
Q980C74SdYQ,235159,237859,vlog about my trip but instead of
Q980C74SdYQ,237859,239629,talking into a camera I use really
Q980C74SdYQ,239629,242420,precise cinematography what would happen
Q980C74SdYQ,242420,244069,movie like cinematography but it's just
Q980C74SdYQ,244069,245959,me going about my daily life going into
Q980C74SdYQ,245959,247190,my hotel room coming out of my hotel
Q980C74SdYQ,247190,249370,room
Q980C74SdYQ,249620,252719,[Music]
Q980C74SdYQ,254820,256920,[Music]
Q980C74SdYQ,256920,259450,and I love that video that video work
Q980C74SdYQ,259450,261010,you should watch it points below and
Q980C74SdYQ,261010,263350,that got me super excited and that's
Q980C74SdYQ,263350,265480,when I made the decision that on my
Q980C74SdYQ,265480,268330,birthday 2015 I would start daily
Q980C74SdYQ,268330,270520,vlogging it wouldn't be this all day
Q980C74SdYQ,270520,271870,long and said I wanted to figure out how
Q980C74SdYQ,271870,273100,to make something that felt a lot more
Q980C74SdYQ,273100,275920,like a movie every day so that was the
Q980C74SdYQ,275920,277120,thinking that's what went through my
Q980C74SdYQ,277120,283060,head fire is starting to vlog so we're
Q980C74SdYQ,283060,285070,not understanding here are the
Q980C74SdYQ,285070,288640,foundational principles that I apply to
Q980C74SdYQ,288640,291280,almost every episode of this daily
Q980C74SdYQ,291280,294670,almost daily vlog number one the most
Q980C74SdYQ,294670,296830,important thing is of course the story
Q980C74SdYQ,296830,299830,but what is a story here's a super basic
Q980C74SdYQ,299830,301570,breakdown of a story and every good
Q980C74SdYQ,301570,303580,story follows this rule that is the rule
Q980C74SdYQ,303580,305620,of a three-act narrative you've got a
Q980C74SdYQ,305620,307510,beginning you've got a middle you've got
Q980C74SdYQ,307510,311140,an end set up conflict resolution Jack
Q980C74SdYQ,311140,312130,and Jill went up the hill to fetch a
Q980C74SdYQ,312130,314380,pail of water act 1 Jack fell down and
Q980C74SdYQ,314380,316690,broke his crown act 2 Jill came tumbling
Q980C74SdYQ,316690,320440,after act 3 set up conflict resolution
Q980C74SdYQ,320440,322870,now in some episodes that super super
Q980C74SdYQ,322870,325030,super literal for example my all-time
Q980C74SdYQ,325030,327220,favorite episode of ever made of this
Q980C74SdYQ,327220,329020,vlog which is called my all-time
Q980C74SdYQ,329020,332170,greatest is such a literal example of
Q980C74SdYQ,332170,334630,set up conflict resolution it just felt
Q980C74SdYQ,334630,336790,so good to make that there's a set up
Q980C74SdYQ,336790,338560,here's what happened there's a conflict
Q980C74SdYQ,338560,340450,oh my god what's the outcome going to be
Q980C74SdYQ,340450,342340,and then there was a resolution happy
Q980C74SdYQ,342340,342880,ending
Q980C74SdYQ,342880,344890,that's not always so literal in every
Q980C74SdYQ,344890,346720,episode but I strive for that in every
Q980C74SdYQ,346720,348790,episode because that is what's at the
Q980C74SdYQ,348790,352120,core of a well-told story and a story is
Q980C74SdYQ,352120,355510,what drives any video like this and that
Q980C74SdYQ,355510,357250,right there was sort of promise or the
Q980C74SdYQ,357250,359500,deal that I made with myself was never
Q980C74SdYQ,359500,361840,an obligation to share with you the
Q980C74SdYQ,361840,363640,intimacy of every day of my life this
Q980C74SdYQ,363640,365920,isn't a journal but instead could I find
Q980C74SdYQ,365920,367630,everyday in my life
Q980C74SdYQ,367630,370150,a three-act narrative to share now a
Q980C74SdYQ,370150,372930,couple of the more granular aspects
Q980C74SdYQ,372930,378030,I always found it kind of hard to watch
Q980C74SdYQ,378030,381030,non-stop shaky camera vlogs
Q980C74SdYQ,381030,382500,it was disorienting it was always a
Q980C74SdYQ,382500,385199,little claustrophobic so so what I try
Q980C74SdYQ,385199,386820,to do is have an equal amount of
Q980C74SdYQ,386820,389370,handheld locked off shots locked off
Q980C74SdYQ,389370,391590,means on a tripod like this and then
Q980C74SdYQ,391590,393570,establishing shot the wide shot so it's
Q980C74SdYQ,393570,395190,establishing shots let you know where I
Q980C74SdYQ,395190,397410,am so it feels more like you're here
Q980C74SdYQ,397410,399419,with me these locked off shots let you
Q980C74SdYQ,399419,401100,the viewer forget about the camera for a
Q980C74SdYQ,401100,402570,second and focus on what I'm saying in
Q980C74SdYQ,402570,404550,the environment that I'm in and then the
Q980C74SdYQ,404550,406680,handheld shots like this enable you to
Q980C74SdYQ,406680,408509,sort of feel the spontaneity and the
Q980C74SdYQ,408509,410610,urgency that is whatever is taking place
Q980C74SdYQ,410610,411660,in my daily life
Q980C74SdYQ,411660,413970,hardware is then what cameras i use I
Q980C74SdYQ,413970,415530,have a simple rule for when it comes to
Q980C74SdYQ,415530,417810,hardware and that is always use the very
Q980C74SdYQ,417810,420210,best camera you have at your disposal so
Q980C74SdYQ,420210,421889,right now I'm shooting this on my big
Q980C74SdYQ,421889,423539,camera I'm shooting in 4k with a nice
Q980C74SdYQ,423539,425250,wide lens this is a perfect shot I've
Q980C74SdYQ,425250,426360,got a light right there I'm trying to
Q980C74SdYQ,426360,428070,make myself look good this is the best I
Q980C74SdYQ,428070,429720,have right now but when I'm out running
Q980C74SdYQ,429720,431490,in the morning and I want to film my run
Q980C74SdYQ,431490,433530,the best I have is my cell phone I keep
Q980C74SdYQ,433530,435120,a point-and-shoot in my backpack in case
Q980C74SdYQ,435120,436800,I don't have this big camera because the
Q980C74SdYQ,436800,438000,point shoot is a little bit more dynamic
Q980C74SdYQ,438000,440639,than just the cell phone so not to hold
Q980C74SdYQ,440639,442770,into any certain kind of hardware or any
Q980C74SdYQ,442770,444870,certain quality of hardware it's what I
Q980C74SdYQ,444870,447300,have access to cinematography part to
Q980C74SdYQ,447300,451110,hold the camera steady no one wants to
Q980C74SdYQ,451110,453150,watch you forsake you cinematography it
Q980C74SdYQ,453150,454889,hurts your brain it's hard to see what's
Q980C74SdYQ,454889,457169,going on it's not pleasurable for you
Q980C74SdYQ,457169,458699,the viewer and it's not easy for me the
Q980C74SdYQ,458699,460590,editor to put it together if it's super
Q980C74SdYQ,460590,462419,shaky if it's nonsensical it's go
Q980C74SdYQ,462419,467449,straight in the trash what's up Marlin
Q980C74SdYQ,467449,470430,almost off your pocket man I'm making a
Q980C74SdYQ,470430,472620,movie Marlin about how to make how I
Q980C74SdYQ,472620,476099,make my blog really yeah like it's not
Q980C74SdYQ,476099,477990,so much a tutorial but it's illusion of
Q980C74SdYQ,477990,480120,light how do aspects of I've never
Q980C74SdYQ,480120,482190,really shared right so you know what you
Q980C74SdYQ,482190,484229,should have done usually suffered me and
Q980C74SdYQ,484229,487230,then taught you sit with me in
Q980C74SdYQ,487230,490530,teach me all to do okay the next version
Q980C74SdYQ,490530,492570,of Casey and I stats logging secrets
Q980C74SdYQ,492570,494190,will be with Marlin we're in a peach and
Q980C74SdYQ,494190,496140,out of law cinematography part three
Q980C74SdYQ,496140,499440,time lapses and drones here's something
Q980C74SdYQ,499440,502500,very important no one gives a [ __ ] about
Q980C74SdYQ,502500,505440,your stupid time lapses your stupid
Q980C74SdYQ,505440,507480,drone shots that's something I remind
Q980C74SdYQ,507480,509850,myself in a daily basis that kind of
Q980C74SdYQ,509850,511590,cinematography only works if it's
Q980C74SdYQ,511590,513659,serving a greater purpose and for me it
Q980C74SdYQ,513659,516330,serves two purposes one is transitional
Q980C74SdYQ,516330,517919,so you'll notice sometimes like I'm
Q980C74SdYQ,517919,519840,outside wrapping up a scene where I'm
Q980C74SdYQ,519840,521610,doing something on my skateboard the
Q980C74SdYQ,521610,522900,next scene I'm in my studio doing
Q980C74SdYQ,522900,524400,something completely different and in
Q980C74SdYQ,524400,526740,between there might be a beautiful drone
Q980C74SdYQ,526740,528480,shot of the city or might be a beautiful
Q980C74SdYQ,528480,530370,time-lapse of the city I'm using it to
Q980C74SdYQ,530370,532530,get me from one scene or one aspect of
Q980C74SdYQ,532530,534720,the story to the next as that it's an
Q980C74SdYQ,534720,536820,incredibly effective tool the other
Q980C74SdYQ,536820,538320,place where it works is to show the
Q980C74SdYQ,538320,541050,audience a broader sort of a broader
Q980C74SdYQ,541050,543570,image of where you are and what's taking
Q980C74SdYQ,543570,546330,place in time drones in particular are
Q980C74SdYQ,546330,549300,great for that I'm at a hotel on a cool
Q980C74SdYQ,549300,550620,Beach and it doesn't really work
Q980C74SdYQ,550620,552660,pointing my camera the drone can give
Q980C74SdYQ,552660,554960,you context that otherwise couldn't
Q980C74SdYQ,554960,557140,[Music]
Q980C74SdYQ,557140,559420,[Applause]
Q980C74SdYQ,559420,561590,it's that kind of ambitious beautiful
Q980C74SdYQ,561590,562550,cinematography doesn't have a
Q980C74SdYQ,562550,564500,relationship with the narrative even if
Q980C74SdYQ,564500,566480,it's just a little relationship it feels
Q980C74SdYQ,566480,568100,out of place and it gets boring very
Q980C74SdYQ,568100,571670,very fast now there is a lot more depth
Q980C74SdYQ,571670,573830,and complexity to it than that things
Q980C74SdYQ,573830,575570,like where does being positive all the
Q980C74SdYQ,575570,577700,time start to just sound like total BS
Q980C74SdYQ,577700,579260,where people don't believe it things
Q980C74SdYQ,579260,580640,like when I'm feeling down and I want to
Q980C74SdYQ,580640,581600,share with you the audience I'm
Q980C74SdYQ,581600,583070,struggling with something how do I do
Q980C74SdYQ,583070,584510,that in a way that you actually care
Q980C74SdYQ,584510,586040,because we've all got our own problems
