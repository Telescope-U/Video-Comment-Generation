n5dlcXEQIw0,15759,19119,dancing pranks that run no more than a
n5dlcXEQIw0,19119,22320,few minutes and often just a few seconds
n5dlcXEQIw0,22320,24720,have become the latest big battleground
n5dlcXEQIw0,24720,26480,in social media
n5dlcXEQIw0,26480,29359,tiktok popularized short form videos and
n5dlcXEQIw0,29359,32078,it's been the front runner for some time
n5dlcXEQIw0,32078,34559,but as we told you last week it's facing
n5dlcXEQIw0,34559,37200,increased competition from rival service
n5dlcXEQIw0,37200,39440,google's youtube shorts
n5dlcXEQIw0,39440,41760,the company says shorts is now reaching
n5dlcXEQIw0,41760,44079,more than one and a half billion users a
n5dlcXEQIw0,44079,45039,month

n5dlcXEQIw0,50559,53680,how do creators feel about using it and
n5dlcXEQIw0,53680,56160,what is youtube's end game in growing
n5dlcXEQIw0,56160,58719,this part of its platform
n5dlcXEQIw0,58719,60800,joining us to discuss all of this is our
n5dlcXEQIw0,60800,63680,social media reporter salvador rodriguez
n5dlcXEQIw0,63680,66320,hi sal thanks for being here hey zoe
n5dlcXEQIw0,66320,67760,thanks for having me
n5dlcXEQIw0,67760,69920,so start us off with a bit of background
n5dlcXEQIw0,69920,72320,why did youtube decide to launch shorts
n5dlcXEQIw0,72320,73680,in the first place and i mentioned it
n5dlcXEQIw0,73680,75119,was you know gaining on tick tock's
n5dlcXEQIw0,75119,78080,popularity but just how popular is it
n5dlcXEQIw0,78080,80000,yeah from what we can tell youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,80000,83280,shorts might be second place in this
n5dlcXEQIw0,83280,85920,new type of social media content you
n5dlcXEQIw0,85920,87360,know in the us
n5dlcXEQIw0,87360,89520,we talked with the folks over at inmar
n5dlcXEQIw0,89520,92159,intelligence and they found that youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,92159,95200,shorts is picked as the number two
n5dlcXEQIw0,95200,97280,preferred service for this type of short
n5dlcXEQIw0,97280,100000,form video and that's only gained since
n5dlcXEQIw0,100000,101680,the last time that they did this survey
n5dlcXEQIw0,101680,103520,back in september
n5dlcXEQIw0,103520,105520,for youtube they decided to go in on
n5dlcXEQIw0,105520,107280,this type of content because it just
n5dlcXEQIw0,107280,109520,made a ton of sense for them they're the
n5dlcXEQIw0,109520,110640,original
n5dlcXEQIw0,110640,112960,video platform of the internet right but
n5dlcXEQIw0,112960,114399,also you know i spoke with a lot of
n5dlcXEQIw0,114399,116079,creators and some of them pointed out
n5dlcXEQIw0,116079,118399,that in many ways tick tock poses a
n5dlcXEQIw0,118399,120640,threat to youtube youtube decided to
n5dlcXEQIw0,120640,123360,launch its shorts in india why did it
n5dlcXEQIw0,123360,125600,pick that market and what's it been like
n5dlcXEQIw0,125600,127680,for shorts growing there
n5dlcXEQIw0,127680,129679,yeah i think the reason they started in
n5dlcXEQIw0,129679,132480,india is because just before youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,132480,135520,launched there in september 2020 a few
n5dlcXEQIw0,135520,137599,months prior india had actually banned
n5dlcXEQIw0,137599,140319,tik tok and several other chinese apps
n5dlcXEQIw0,140319,142879,they cited national security concerns as
n5dlcXEQIw0,142879,145360,the reason for doing that and that just
n5dlcXEQIw0,145360,148000,created a huge opening for youtube to go
n5dlcXEQIw0,148000,151519,in to a really huge market and you know
n5dlcXEQIw0,151519,153599,get started test out this new type of
n5dlcXEQIw0,153599,156239,thing but really gain a foothold in that
n5dlcXEQIw0,156239,158239,market and that's something that from
n5dlcXEQIw0,158239,160160,our reporting we can tell is continuing
n5dlcXEQIw0,160160,162720,to carry them today you know we spoke
n5dlcXEQIw0,162720,164800,with one creator his name is jonathan
n5dlcXEQIw0,164800,168080,lyons he uh he dresses up as a as a huge
n5dlcXEQIw0,168080,170080,rat and he posts these videos on youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,170080,172720,shorts he told us that almost 80 percent
n5dlcXEQIw0,172720,175280,of his views are coming from india
n5dlcXEQIw0,175280,177280,and even more of his views come from
n5dlcXEQIw0,177280,179920,nearby country so it's really become a
n5dlcXEQIw0,179920,181840,stronghold for youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,181840,183760,now as they grow and they've hit this
n5dlcXEQIw0,183760,186159,huge mark of 1.5 billion users you know
n5dlcXEQIw0,186159,187440,that's something that you can really
n5dlcXEQIw0,187440,189440,build upon and what they're really going
n5dlcXEQIw0,189440,190959,to have to do is make sure that they
n5dlcXEQIw0,190959,192879,build up that audience here in the us
n5dlcXEQIw0,192879,193920,because
n5dlcXEQIw0,193920,195440,they're doing good with india they're
n5dlcXEQIw0,195440,197680,doing good with older americans but when
n5dlcXEQIw0,197680,199519,it comes to advertising which is really
n5dlcXEQIw0,199519,202159,the next step the most desirable
n5dlcXEQIw0,202159,204799,audience for advertisers are those young
n5dlcXEQIw0,204799,206879,americans those young consumers that
n5dlcXEQIw0,206879,209280,they can you know grab a hold of and
n5dlcXEQIw0,209280,211519,keep us customers for a lifetime i want
n5dlcXEQIw0,211519,213120,to pick up on something you said you
n5dlcXEQIw0,213120,215440,know youtube shorts is popular with
n5dlcXEQIw0,215440,218000,older americans i mean why would
n5dlcXEQIw0,218000,219840,americans kind of 45 and up be
n5dlcXEQIw0,219840,222080,gravitating towards youtube shorts
n5dlcXEQIw0,222080,224400,youtube already had more than two
n5dlcXEQIw0,224400,226560,billion people who go to youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,226560,227760,regularly
n5dlcXEQIw0,227760,230640,and they've also built out a ton of
n5dlcXEQIw0,230640,232799,analytics tools for creators so they can
n5dlcXEQIw0,232799,234400,get a sense of how well their videos are
n5dlcXEQIw0,234400,236879,doing um who's watching them and from
n5dlcXEQIw0,236879,239200,where and basically youtube took those
n5dlcXEQIw0,239200,240400,two things
n5dlcXEQIw0,240400,242560,and turned them into success you know
n5dlcXEQIw0,242560,244640,they've been around since 2005 so they
n5dlcXEQIw0,244640,246959,have older users at this point
n5dlcXEQIw0,246959,248159,and i think
n5dlcXEQIw0,248159,249920,one reason why if you're an older
n5dlcXEQIw0,249920,251120,american
n5dlcXEQIw0,251120,252480,and you're going to youtube shorts
n5dlcXEQIw0,252480,253760,instead of tick tick-tock it simply
n5dlcXEQIw0,253760,255040,comes down to
n5dlcXEQIw0,255040,256400,changing your habits you know you've
n5dlcXEQIw0,256400,258639,probably been going to youtube for more
n5dlcXEQIw0,258639,261519,than a decade and getting into tik-tok
n5dlcXEQIw0,261519,263440,it's not really hard but it still
n5dlcXEQIw0,263440,265600,requires that someone download one more
n5dlcXEQIw0,265600,268160,app sign up for one more account but i
n5dlcXEQIw0,268160,269680,guess the big question is how does
n5dlcXEQIw0,269680,272000,youtube transition you know from the
n5dlcXEQIw0,272000,274320,older viewers and from a big indian
n5dlcXEQIw0,274320,276960,market to a global market with younger
n5dlcXEQIw0,276960,278320,viewers
n5dlcXEQIw0,278320,280240,yeah i think it's gonna take time but
n5dlcXEQIw0,280240,281919,i've also noticed you know as a regular
n5dlcXEQIw0,281919,283759,consumer watching tv i've noticed that
n5dlcXEQIw0,283759,285360,they've been you know doing more and
n5dlcXEQIw0,285360,287520,more marketing just the other day i saw
n5dlcXEQIw0,287520,290960,youtube ran an ad for pride month and
n5dlcXEQIw0,290960,292400,they were saying like hey you know it's
n5dlcXEQIw0,292400,294880,pride month like show your pride by
n5dlcXEQIw0,294880,297280,posting a youtube short and every
n5dlcXEQIw0,297280,299040,every video that you post you know will
n5dlcXEQIw0,299040,301520,make one more donation to you know some
n5dlcXEQIw0,301520,304320,group involved in pride and i think like
n5dlcXEQIw0,304320,307360,those type of strategies will just pump
n5dlcXEQIw0,307360,309360,more and more content into that youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,309360,311520,shorts pipeline and what they really
n5dlcXEQIw0,311520,314000,need to get to is to a place where their
n5dlcXEQIw0,314000,315600,videos are the ones that are starting
n5dlcXEQIw0,315600,318160,trends and really you know hitting that
n5dlcXEQIw0,318160,320960,cultural cachet because at this point in
n5dlcXEQIw0,320960,323440,time that's a big reason that tick tock
n5dlcXEQIw0,323440,325759,leads in this market
n5dlcXEQIw0,325759,327759,you've spoken to a bunch of creators who
n5dlcXEQIw0,327759,329280,are using youtube shorts and what have
n5dlcXEQIw0,329280,331360,they said about the experience of using
n5dlcXEQIw0,331360,332400,it
n5dlcXEQIw0,332400,334639,yeah well the creators they love the
n5dlcXEQIw0,334639,336320,analytics that they get with youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,336320,337759,short so they can go in there and they
n5dlcXEQIw0,337759,340400,can see how old are my users what
n5dlcXEQIw0,340400,342560,geography are they coming from are they
n5dlcXEQIw0,342560,345520,on android are they on iphone they can
n5dlcXEQIw0,345520,347360,you know really get into the nitty
n5dlcXEQIw0,347360,350000,gritty of what's going on and that helps
n5dlcXEQIw0,350000,351919,them figure out you know the formulas
n5dlcXEQIw0,351919,352880,for
n5dlcXEQIw0,352880,354240,which videos are going to work which
n5dlcXEQIw0,354240,356160,videos are going to get me views and
n5dlcXEQIw0,356160,358479,another thing that folks love about
n5dlcXEQIw0,358479,360400,youtube shorts is that it just has
n5dlcXEQIw0,360400,362400,another one of those classic google
n5dlcXEQIw0,362400,366160,strengths which is that it's way easier
n5dlcXEQIw0,366160,368960,to search for a video on youtube shorts
n5dlcXEQIw0,368960,371120,than it is to search for a video on tick
n5dlcXEQIw0,371120,373360,tock or instagram reels the biggest
n5dlcXEQIw0,373360,375440,criticism though that we heard so far
n5dlcXEQIw0,375440,377840,from creators about youtube shorts is
n5dlcXEQIw0,377840,378720,that
n5dlcXEQIw0,378720,381199,when it comes to actually applying
n5dlcXEQIw0,381199,383360,special effects to videos
n5dlcXEQIw0,383360,385840,that is where youtube shorts is lacking
n5dlcXEQIw0,385840,388639,most i mean that's from the creator side
n5dlcXEQIw0,388639,391280,from from youtube side from google side
n5dlcXEQIw0,391280,393360,this has to be about you know ad revenue
n5dlcXEQIw0,393360,396000,right i mean how profitable are youtube
n5dlcXEQIw0,396000,397680,shorts for the company
n5dlcXEQIw0,397680,399440,yeah well right now it's not
n5dlcXEQIw0,399440,401199,particularly profitable just because
n5dlcXEQIw0,401199,403120,they haven't prioritized advertising
n5dlcXEQIw0,403120,404160,just yet
n5dlcXEQIw0,404160,406000,it wasn't until last month that they
n5dlcXEQIw0,406000,408000,finally rolled out ads globally for
n5dlcXEQIw0,408000,410319,youtube shorts but even now it's still
n5dlcXEQIw0,410319,412479,you know experimental and they're only
n5dlcXEQIw0,412479,414319,starting to ramp it up but certainly
n5dlcXEQIw0,414319,415680,that's going to be the direction that
n5dlcXEQIw0,415680,418479,they start heading in and they really do
n5dlcXEQIw0,418479,420639,need to get that going just because you
n5dlcXEQIw0,420639,421360,know
n5dlcXEQIw0,421360,423520,more recently their revenue growth has
n5dlcXEQIw0,423520,425759,been flagging as of late
n5dlcXEQIw0,425759,427440,all right that was our reporter salvador
