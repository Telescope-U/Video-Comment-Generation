P2BQV3b6RhE,271040,272720,heats it up it's also going to soften it
P2BQV3b6RhE,272720,274160,up a little bit putting it over the hot
P2BQV3b6RhE,274160,276000,charcoal here it is almost ready she
P2BQV3b6RhE,276000,277840,puts it to the side for just a moment
P2BQV3b6RhE,277840,280400,she grabs a plastic cup she inserts it
P2BQV3b6RhE,280400,282400,into the plastic cup and then right here
P2BQV3b6RhE,282400,285040,this is the main flavor oh a load of

P2BQV3b6RhE,301199,302880,it's a little sour super oniony and
P2BQV3b6RhE,302880,304560,actually quite spicy too so my mouth

P2BQV3b6RhE,318320,320240,crunchy both overall i like it but
P2BQV3b6RhE,320240,322240,what's saving it is definitely the power
P2BQV3b6RhE,322240,324160,from this sauce if it was an option i
P2BQV3b6RhE,324160,325520,would buy this from her because i would
P2BQV3b6RhE,325520,326639,love to put this on just about
P2BQV3b6RhE,326639,328080,everything but if you're in the store
P2BQV3b6RhE,328080,330400,just look for nature's spring that's the
P2BQV3b6RhE,330400,333330,brand of this vinegar or or maybe not

P2BQV3b6RhE,354639,356639,corn another layer of chemical cheese
P2BQV3b6RhE,356639,358800,powder oh and then corn juice on that
P2BQV3b6RhE,358800,360160,and that might even help that cheese

P2BQV3b6RhE,367520,369520,far all of the cheese has kind of
P2BQV3b6RhE,369520,371280,dissolved and then melted into one
P2BQV3b6RhE,371280,373039,consistency almost like a cheese soup i
P2BQV3b6RhE,373039,374400,know some you think it might be being
P2BQV3b6RhE,374400,376160,sarcastic but i call it chemical cheese

P2BQV3b6RhE,681680,683600,can sell at a very low price point where
P2BQV3b6RhE,683600,685040,they can still make a profit and so
