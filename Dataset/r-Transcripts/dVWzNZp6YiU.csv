dVWzNZp6YiU,5600,11280,what does it mean to be a little better  every single day
dVWzNZp6YiU,11280,17279,[Music]  james clears noted  that if each day you improve by only one
dVWzNZp6YiU,17279,24240,percent  you'll be a full  37 times better in a year
dVWzNZp6YiU,24240,32398,that's an almost unfathomable number  unbelievable transformation imagine  being 37 times better at what it is
dVWzNZp6YiU,32398,38640,you're looking to improve on  37 times more efficient or skilled
dVWzNZp6YiU,38640,45840,all because of a one percent per day  commitment almost sounds too good to be  true
dVWzNZp6YiU,46399,51840,here's the catch though  one percent doesn't seem like much
dVWzNZp6YiU,52399,58879,which is good one might think  you know that should make it easier
dVWzNZp6YiU,58879,65518,well  sort of  the easier and more seemingly trivial
dVWzNZp6YiU,65518,73840,something is to accomplish  the easier it is to dismiss it as well
dVWzNZp6YiU,73920,79600,we've all been there that and maybe not  today maybe tomorrow no big deal
dVWzNZp6YiU,79600,84720,we don't lose anything  and that's what we must learn to wrestle
dVWzNZp6YiU,84720,90560,with  jim rohn puts it this way he says being  successful is easy
dVWzNZp6YiU,90720,95920,the issue is that being unsuccessful is  easy too
dVWzNZp6YiU,96560,102399,saying yes to the little things you know  you need to do is easy
dVWzNZp6YiU,102399,107680,but so is saying no  putting your phone away to work on
dVWzNZp6YiU,107680,112798,something of substance  yeah that's pretty easy
dVWzNZp6YiU,112960,120718,but watching just one more tick tock or  instagram or youtube video  that's easy too
dVWzNZp6YiU,120799,129280,putting your shoes on going for a walk  or run heading to the gym  hey procedurally pretty easy
dVWzNZp6YiU,129280,134560,not that complex  but talking yourself into just going
dVWzNZp6YiU,134560,140480,tomorrow instead  also a rationalization that's pretty
dVWzNZp6YiU,140480,148800,easy  and that's essentially the question  which easy are you going to go with
dVWzNZp6YiU,148800,154879,how do you put yourself in position to  select the right easy
dVWzNZp6YiU,154879,159920,well like so many things  it starts with the world view and flows
dVWzNZp6YiU,159920,166080,out to the tangible actions we take in  support of that worldview
dVWzNZp6YiU,166080,172959,first things first  we have to know that the biggest  advantage available
dVWzNZp6YiU,172959,178959,is seeing the small things as so much  more than small things
dVWzNZp6YiU,178959,187360,it's refusing to fall victim  to the disappointment and burnout  associated with hoping for one huge jump
dVWzNZp6YiU,187360,192959,a miracle solution the answer that will  change everything
dVWzNZp6YiU,192959,198000,that's deceiving  winning looks small and consistent
dVWzNZp6YiU,198000,204480,progress is boring it's mundane it looks  like deciding on what matters
dVWzNZp6YiU,204480,210400,and then making a pact with yourself  every day to keep your own promises
dVWzNZp6YiU,210400,217360,when most would fall off or push things  to tomorrow  it's seeing your commitment
dVWzNZp6YiU,217360,223360,as everything  knowing that the people who manufacture
dVWzNZp6YiU,223360,229120,significance in their lives  they treat what others would call silly
dVWzNZp6YiU,229120,235680,and trivial  as life and death  they make the details into the whole
dVWzNZp6YiU,235680,243200,storyline so yeah it might be easy for  someone else to walk away but when you  have given yourself no other option but
dVWzNZp6YiU,243200,249519,to succeed  the little steps to make it happen  requires zero thought or internal
dVWzNZp6YiU,249519,254640,deliberation  the person who gets into shape over the
dVWzNZp6YiU,254640,260079,course of six months  they're not going to be the one who  found a secret diet bought a piece of
dVWzNZp6YiU,260079,265919,equipment on amazon  they didn't do the necessary thing here  and there when they had their fleeting
dVWzNZp6YiU,265919,272000,moments of inspiration no they made  better consistent decisions no to the
dVWzNZp6YiU,272000,278479,soda yes to the water no to the alarm  yes to the run no to the netflix and yes
dVWzNZp6YiU,278479,284880,to the gym  both options were easy in the moments in  which they arose
dVWzNZp6YiU,284880,290720,but each time only one option mattered  and that's what it's about
dVWzNZp6YiU,290720,296000,tying the prolonged gratification to  something that means the world to you
dVWzNZp6YiU,296000,304400,where each step is not just a step  but one step closer to the moon
dVWzNZp6YiU,304400,312320,so no it's certainly not that a can of  coke or dessert or the day off will kill  you but flip the narrative
dVWzNZp6YiU,312320,317680,it's that when you do stay true to your  mission  and the promises you make to yourself
dVWzNZp6YiU,317680,324960,you get something so much more back  it's not oh what will i lose by skipping
dVWzNZp6YiU,324960,330080,this one percent  no in a world where excellence compounds
dVWzNZp6YiU,330080,336080,it's look what i am becoming and this  decision is an investment too good to
dVWzNZp6YiU,336080,342639,pass up  and every decision to move forward  to embrace the things that align with
dVWzNZp6YiU,342639,349360,your true north  is a nod  to that future
dVWzNZp6YiU,349360,352360,self
dVWzNZp6YiU,356490,362880,[Music]  you don't allow yourself to be  vulnerable
dVWzNZp6YiU,362880,368960,you forfeit your greatness  if you don't risk failure
dVWzNZp6YiU,368960,374160,you have no shot at being the one who  makes a statement
dVWzNZp6YiU,374160,381039,you don't risk them laughing at you you  have no shot at them clapping for you
dVWzNZp6YiU,381039,386560,if you don't risk trading today for a  future outcome that's uncertain
dVWzNZp6YiU,386560,392000,you'll never know the fortune that that  future held
dVWzNZp6YiU,392240,399840,yeah being vulnerable it's difficult  it's hard it hurts but it has to
dVWzNZp6YiU,399840,406479,it's the ocean that separates what you  have from what you want the mountain  that stands between who you are and who
dVWzNZp6YiU,406479,412240,you want to be  being vulnerable it means you stop
dVWzNZp6YiU,412240,418800,looking at what can go wrong and you  start thinking about what can go right
dVWzNZp6YiU,418800,424560,because every question is a double-edged  sword right do you release that song
dVWzNZp6YiU,424560,430400,because it could flop  but it will also kick-start your dream
dVWzNZp6YiU,430400,436800,do you make that first trip to the gym  because you'll probably look like you  have no clue what you're doing but it
dVWzNZp6YiU,436800,442400,could also lead you to feeling better  about yourself than you ever have before
dVWzNZp6YiU,442400,449680,do you apply for that promotion because  you could be let down  but it could also lead to a career
dVWzNZp6YiU,449680,455919,transformation do you see the dynamic  here  every major decision comes with risk and
dVWzNZp6YiU,455919,460960,that's why people avoid making them  standing out
dVWzNZp6YiU,460960,467599,taking the road less traveled they shake  our deeply rooted desire to fit in
dVWzNZp6YiU,467599,472800,right at the foundation  they conflict like fire and water see so
dVWzNZp6YiU,472800,478800,much of our stress comes from a need to  belong to preserve a reputation
dVWzNZp6YiU,478800,487840,to be cool  you want a fun experiment watch how fast  being cool turns into mediocrity
dVWzNZp6YiU,487840,494160,it's doing the things that are not cool  over and over again that constitute  greatness the ones who are different
dVWzNZp6YiU,494160,499599,bold out there they change things  the ones who are okay being called
dVWzNZp6YiU,499599,507440,irrational okay being laughed at okay  with failing and not getting it the  first time around
dVWzNZp6YiU,507440,512800,if you do not let yourself be vulnerable  you never experience failure on a
dVWzNZp6YiU,512800,519440,significant level you don't fail you  don't learn you don't learn you don't  grow and if that's the case forget about
dVWzNZp6YiU,519440,526320,the top of the mountain  safety  comfort a flawless reputation gets you a
dVWzNZp6YiU,526320,533600,nice seat at the bottom looking up at  greatness  at those who saw the opportunity and
dVWzNZp6YiU,533600,539680,we're willing to take a chance  so while you climb keep your eyes on  that big picture remember that we
dVWzNZp6YiU,539680,546399,outgrow our worries  through each stage of our lives we look  back and we realize that our previous
dVWzNZp6YiU,546399,551600,priorities were misaligned we worried  about things that didn't matter
dVWzNZp6YiU,551600,557920,allowed our decisions to be guided by  variables that were irrelevant  and that's the beauty of risk it
dVWzNZp6YiU,557920,563040,escalates this realization  pushes us further and further past the
dVWzNZp6YiU,563040,568240,little things that mean less and less  with each step taken your mistakes will
dVWzNZp6YiU,568240,574399,not matter  criticism from strangers will not matter  what will matter is whether you took
dVWzNZp6YiU,574399,579600,control and did something meaningful  with your life
dVWzNZp6YiU,579600,584240,whether you followed your heart and your  instinct
dVWzNZp6YiU,584640,590080,and i know it's hard i know it's  uncomfortable  i can't sit here and guarantee the path
dVWzNZp6YiU,590080,597680,will be paved out in gold everything  will go how you want but i can promise  this you will learn you will adapt and
dVWzNZp6YiU,597680,604480,move forward  i can promise that the critics and the  naysayers get smaller and smaller
dVWzNZp6YiU,604480,609519,until they fade out of the picture  altogether and most importantly
dVWzNZp6YiU,609519,615200,i can promise that if you don't do  anything you will not go anywhere and
dVWzNZp6YiU,615200,621440,that is the only way to fail  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,621440,627440,so trust yourself  trust the process believe that you are
dVWzNZp6YiU,627440,635170,extraordinary  and go make your magic
dVWzNZp6YiU,635170,655519,[Applause]  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,655519,663120,there's something incredible about the  prospect of starting over not because  you're unhappy with who you are
dVWzNZp6YiU,663120,668399,or because each step that brought you  here wasn't perfect in its own unique  way
dVWzNZp6YiU,668399,675279,but because somewhere  deep down  we can feel the infinite
dVWzNZp6YiU,675279,681440,we know that when it comes to what's  possible  we are a flicker of light
dVWzNZp6YiU,681440,687360,in a galaxy of stars  waiting to take shape
dVWzNZp6YiU,687360,692959,find our way  to shine out across the very elements
dVWzNZp6YiU,692959,699680,from which we came  see beginning again simply means
dVWzNZp6YiU,699680,706240,a new  chapter  it means the next adventure
dVWzNZp6YiU,706320,714560,it's places you've never gone  people you've never met  it's stories untold and dreams still
dVWzNZp6YiU,714560,721040,dancing around in your head  there's an old dr seuss quote i remember
dVWzNZp6YiU,721040,727600,as a kid  he said sometimes you will never know  the value of a moment
dVWzNZp6YiU,727600,733279,until it becomes a memory and turning  the page on that chapter is
dVWzNZp6YiU,733279,740720,if nothing else  a temporary reminder that we are in  the very moments we'll look back on and
dVWzNZp6YiU,740720,746880,smile  [Music]  shines a spotlight on the people that
dVWzNZp6YiU,746880,752000,mean the most  [Music]  and reassures us that the small stuff
dVWzNZp6YiU,752000,758079,just might be  the big stuff  after all life doesn't dwell on the
dVWzNZp6YiU,758079,766079,heartbreak or the times we fell  but the times we got back up
dVWzNZp6YiU,766079,771680,the times we looked with confidence at  the road ahead
dVWzNZp6YiU,771680,780079,and smiled  at the horizon  as each fleeting moment is discovered
dVWzNZp6YiU,780079,786279,for the very  [Music]  first  time
dVWzNZp6YiU,789440,795360,so here's to breathing in that ocean  breeze
dVWzNZp6YiU,795360,802399,laughing until your stomach  hurts here's to dreaming like there are
dVWzNZp6YiU,802399,808320,no rules and living like there's no  tomorrow
dVWzNZp6YiU,808480,816639,so creating your masterpiece one word  one note one brush stroke at a time
dVWzNZp6YiU,816639,824160,to dancing when the music isn't playing  and sharing your song when it is
dVWzNZp6YiU,824800,831839,here's to seeing  the beauty when most walk right by it
dVWzNZp6YiU,831920,837760,being light in darkness and a voice in  silence here's to living life on your
dVWzNZp6YiU,837760,843360,terms  paving your own path and writing your  own story
dVWzNZp6YiU,843360,848639,the one where the hero doesn't stop  until the princess is saved and the
dVWzNZp6YiU,848639,855440,castle is taken the one where reality is  a reflection of imagination
dVWzNZp6YiU,855440,860560,because if you do these things when you  look back years from now you'll have a
dVWzNZp6YiU,860560,866160,lot to say but i promise you i wish  won't be one of them
dVWzNZp6YiU,866160,874440,not because of what you were given  but because of what you chose
dVWzNZp6YiU,890000,895600,do you ever wonder how much of you has  materialized  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,895600,900959,like if what f scott fitzgerald says is  true and our lives are defined by  opportunity
dVWzNZp6YiU,900959,906480,even the ones we miss  then how much
dVWzNZp6YiU,906480,913120,remains in the ether  and i don't think it's about playing a  game of what if
dVWzNZp6YiU,913120,919279,you know that would be endless it would  be self-defeating no one's perfect  i don't even really think it's about
dVWzNZp6YiU,919279,926160,making a right turn instead of a left  because as long as you're moving and  moving with conviction life ultimately
dVWzNZp6YiU,926160,932320,brings you where you need to be  [Music]  but more my concern is the steps never
dVWzNZp6YiU,932320,937920,brought to pavement  my ideas unhatch my opportunities i
dVWzNZp6YiU,937920,945199,either knowingly or unknowingly left on  the shelf  because it didn't seem real enough
dVWzNZp6YiU,945199,950480,like a broadway play between my ears  that as a spectator i knew would end
dVWzNZp6YiU,950480,956480,after all that's what stories do  how much of ourselves
dVWzNZp6YiU,956480,964320,have we cast aside as simply the things  we don't say out loud
dVWzNZp6YiU,964480,970240,at first it's infinite we've yet to be  taught to limit because limits aren't  things they're ideas and ideas must be
dVWzNZp6YiU,970240,975759,adopted that's why they say some of  life's best things were done by people  too ignorant to know they were
dVWzNZp6YiU,975759,982560,impossible too naive of the notion that  they couldn't say them out loud  then it's comparison they have what i
dVWzNZp6YiU,982560,989199,want but it was meant for them and not  me how delusional to think i could have  it how crazy to think that life has yet
dVWzNZp6YiU,989199,996560,to be written and i am an author my date  is with normalcy in the box where i keep  those things we don't say out loud and
dVWzNZp6YiU,996560,1002240,then we look around and we see highlight  reels we see awards and vacations and  smiles but we don't have to think maybe
dVWzNZp6YiU,1002240,1007440,they're just like me maybe they're  people who struggle and question  themselves and doubt the road ahead no
dVWzNZp6YiU,1007440,1013680,it must be the past diverged they took  happiness and i took those things we  don't say out loud and then there's
dVWzNZp6YiU,1013680,1019600,everyday life when things don't go as  planned when the world presents  curveballs and you haven't learned to
dVWzNZp6YiU,1019600,1025918,hit off speed so you feel small and you  feel inadequate and ill-equipped and you  could reach out but that's not cool
dVWzNZp6YiU,1025918,1032558,that's not right that's something that  you don't say out loud but we keep it in  like all in and eventually it becomes
dVWzNZp6YiU,1032558,1038640,the if onlys and i wish i had it's the  quiet envy gazing longingly towards  those who just cared less who realized
dVWzNZp6YiU,1038640,1046079,maybe life's not as serious as we make  it out to be who turn thoughts to things  not by burying but by embodying them and
dVWzNZp6YiU,1046079,1052640,maybe that's the trick  to unlock the gate keeping your  perceived reality from the possibility
dVWzNZp6YiU,1052640,1057760,of a new one the one you could create if  only you promoted your fleeting thoughts
dVWzNZp6YiU,1057760,1065280,to forward progress see dreams can fail  to come to fruition in two places in  your head and outside of it but at least
dVWzNZp6YiU,1065280,1071120,outside it has a chance  at least outside you can take the common
dVWzNZp6YiU,1071120,1076320,normal everyday background and make it  the back drop to your movie where you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1076320,1082400,play a lead role  but it must be accepted and acknowledged  not thought of or even whispered but
dVWzNZp6YiU,1082400,1087600,screamed so that the details and the  trivialities that exist now work for you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1087600,1094880,that's right they are now yours not  because you thought about it but because  you reached out a hand and you took you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1094880,1100400,asked the world for something and in  life it will always be true that you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1100400,1105840,don't get what you do not ask for
dVWzNZp6YiU,1105840,1112559,so when you find yourself staring up a  wall comprised of self-defeating  narratives and manufactured limits be
dVWzNZp6YiU,1112559,1117919,ignorant be irrational be the reason  your dreams have a chance
dVWzNZp6YiU,1117919,1124960,and when you look around and you see  more and wonder why you don't have it  know that you can you're allowed to if
dVWzNZp6YiU,1124960,1130880,you sacrifice you will but you must  believe that you are worthy of it not in  the back of your head where you keep
dVWzNZp6YiU,1130880,1137679,your locker combo in movie quotes but in  reality where words bounce off lips and
dVWzNZp6YiU,1137679,1144640,when you feel like life is treating you  unfairly like they're happier or have it  better know that life is peaks and
dVWzNZp6YiU,1144640,1151919,valleys not just for you but for  everyone in how you internalize that and  carry on makes the difference and when
dVWzNZp6YiU,1151919,1157120,you feel  lost or stuck you are not hopeless but
dVWzNZp6YiU,1157120,1163039,in progress being broken down so that  you can be reconstructed stronger better
dVWzNZp6YiU,1163039,1169280,victory is not in hiding those struggles  but accepting them as the difference as
dVWzNZp6YiU,1169280,1175039,the reason you created the miraculous  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,1175039,1181760,not because you had dreams  because you said them
dVWzNZp6YiU,1181760,1199820,out loud  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,1205670,1213280,[Music]  remember the little things
dVWzNZp6YiU,1213280,1220000,the ones we all come to appreciate  perhaps  a little too late
dVWzNZp6YiU,1220000,1225840,that feeling of of comfort our little  eyes first understood to be home
dVWzNZp6YiU,1225840,1231440,those little conversations we still  think about the ones that shaped us
dVWzNZp6YiU,1231440,1238080,those little stretches of time we  thought would last forever but  to our surprise
dVWzNZp6YiU,1238080,1244720,had a final moment written into the  story  oh those little
dVWzNZp6YiU,1244720,1250400,things  i remember going to a concert in high
dVWzNZp6YiU,1250400,1256640,school  i was at the orpheum in boston  massachusetts i went with two of my  friends
dVWzNZp6YiU,1256640,1262799,had an amazing time and well years and  years have obviously passed and recently
dVWzNZp6YiU,1262799,1269460,i asked myself what is it i remember  about that day  why is it such a powerful moment for me
dVWzNZp6YiU,1269460,1275360,[Music]  and interestingly enough  i don't remember any of the songs that
dVWzNZp6YiU,1275360,1280400,were sung  or how well  they were played i don't remember what i
dVWzNZp6YiU,1280400,1287919,bought or what i wore or what teenage  troubles i was going through at the time  no years later
dVWzNZp6YiU,1287919,1294000,i remember how it felt to stand there in  the center of that theater
dVWzNZp6YiU,1294320,1300159,color of the lights filling up the room  the bass drum resonating in my chest
dVWzNZp6YiU,1300159,1307520,aligning with my heartbeat the people i  was with  the funny thing is 17 year old me had no
dVWzNZp6YiU,1307520,1315840,clue he was driving into the city for a  night he'd remember forever  but not because of the music
dVWzNZp6YiU,1316320,1322720,no because of a feeling  because he would spend the time  with the same people he would have hung
dVWzNZp6YiU,1322720,1327760,out with anyway at home  and perhaps subconsciously i knew
dVWzNZp6YiU,1327760,1334320,perhaps we all do but at the time  it all felt like details
dVWzNZp6YiU,1334320,1340960,at the time they were simply included in  the story of by one get one if you will
dVWzNZp6YiU,1340960,1347799,oh how they hide themselves  those little things
dVWzNZp6YiU,1348240,1354799,in a way it's not too different from the  oxygen we breathe in  and breathe out intertwined in everyday
dVWzNZp6YiU,1354799,1360320,life  necessary to carry on to grow to evolve
dVWzNZp6YiU,1360320,1368240,yet only missed when it's gone  we don't think about the air we breathe
dVWzNZp6YiU,1368240,1373360,unless of course we are submerged and  without it
dVWzNZp6YiU,1373360,1380080,so why why does this matter why put this  thought to paper
dVWzNZp6YiU,1380159,1387039,well because to use my previous concert  hall metaphor  i've spent so much of my life thinking
dVWzNZp6YiU,1387039,1393210,about the stage presence the accuracy of  the notes the visual appearances
dVWzNZp6YiU,1393210,1399520,[Music]  the wrong things  it seemed intuitive overwhelmingly
dVWzNZp6YiU,1399520,1405440,obvious but now they're just reminders  how easily we can walk on what matters
dVWzNZp6YiU,1405440,1410158,to get our hands  on what doesn't
dVWzNZp6YiU,1411039,1416159,do we know what's important  do we know what we hold dear do we think
dVWzNZp6YiU,1416159,1422799,enough about those little things  every time the caller id says mom or dad
dVWzNZp6YiU,1422799,1429840,or nana banana  when my little brother and sister get  new apartments jobs promotions start
dVWzNZp6YiU,1429840,1436720,navigating this crazy world every time i  open my laptop  and get to bleed my thoughts onto a
dVWzNZp6YiU,1436720,1444320,blank page over a cup of coffee in a  sunrise  running around random towns across this
dVWzNZp6YiU,1444320,1449440,country with my best friends bringing  ideas to life
dVWzNZp6YiU,1451360,1456840,see the now tells you they are nice  things  happy things lovely
dVWzNZp6YiU,1456840,1462960,things but it doesn't let you in on the  greatest secret of all
dVWzNZp6YiU,1463200,1468230,those little things just might be  everything
dVWzNZp6YiU,1468230,1473279,[Music]  so see them while you're in them
dVWzNZp6YiU,1473279,1478039,and hold on  tight
dVWzNZp6YiU,1480610,1496480,[Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,1513279,1519440,every single dream  vision or idea in your life
dVWzNZp6YiU,1519440,1525200,starts with a simple understanding  that it's obtainable
dVWzNZp6YiU,1525200,1531840,that you can make it real that's the  beginning of everything  self-belief
dVWzNZp6YiU,1531840,1537520,is the gatekeeper that stands between  current  and future
dVWzNZp6YiU,1537520,1542640,see if you think of reality as as these  city walls you're living in
dVWzNZp6YiU,1542640,1548880,it's not crazy to think that they're  going to be people that only know that  existence within the walls right that's
dVWzNZp6YiU,1548880,1554840,what they see that's what most believe  it's how they live  it is only
dVWzNZp6YiU,1554840,1560480,self-belief a confidence in something  greater outside those walls that opens
dVWzNZp6YiU,1560480,1567760,the gate that expands your reality and  if you don't believe anything good  exists on the other side
dVWzNZp6YiU,1567760,1574400,why begin  if you don't think you're capable of  getting there why start
dVWzNZp6YiU,1574400,1580720,and this formula is simple right let's  not overthink it we only move towards  outcomes
dVWzNZp6YiU,1580720,1587919,that we believe to be possible  and that's more important than uh  ability skill set strength i mean you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1587919,1593120,name it believing in yourself trumps  all that
dVWzNZp6YiU,1593120,1598400,because the person with an inferior  skill set maybe an average natural  talent
dVWzNZp6YiU,1598400,1605919,but they believe in something and they  move towards it they give everything for  this idea they know it to be true
dVWzNZp6YiU,1605919,1611840,they'll always be the talented person  that's unsure  that procrastinates that as one foot in
dVWzNZp6YiU,1611840,1618880,and one foot out  and if you don't believe in yourself  you're building a city on sand because
dVWzNZp6YiU,1618880,1624480,i'll tell you what great things  they're great for a reason
dVWzNZp6YiU,1624480,1630000,they're in rare supply they're limited  which means not everyone can have them
dVWzNZp6YiU,1630000,1635600,which means those who do have them have  to fight for them  have to deal with being uncomfortable
dVWzNZp6YiU,1635600,1642159,have to give more sacrifice more pay a  steeper price than the masses
dVWzNZp6YiU,1642159,1647279,and if you don't look in the mirror  stare yourself in the face and know you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1647279,1652840,are one of those select few  what's going to happen when life kicks  back at
dVWzNZp6YiU,1652840,1658640,you you'll fall you'll resort back to  what you know you'll flee the battle
dVWzNZp6YiU,1658640,1665840,for safety security and comfort  but when you know your movie ends at the
dVWzNZp6YiU,1665840,1672960,top of the mountain when you know at the  end of the day you're going to cross a  finish line or hold a trophy your brain
dVWzNZp6YiU,1672960,1679919,internalizes conflict differently  very differently  for someone with self-belief obstacles
dVWzNZp6YiU,1679919,1685440,don't make you wonder if you should keep  going  because you already know you have to
dVWzNZp6YiU,1685440,1692559,keep going i mean come on you haven't  arrived yet  there's still a road to travel
dVWzNZp6YiU,1692559,1698000,no in this situation obstacles simply  prompt you to ask how
dVWzNZp6YiU,1698000,1704240,how can i get through this and that's  the small discrepancy that changes  everything
dVWzNZp6YiU,1704240,1712559,because at some point you'll look to  your right and you'll look to your left  and you'll find  very few people get to the how question
dVWzNZp6YiU,1712559,1717840,they all stopped at if  i wonder if i can do this i wonder if
dVWzNZp6YiU,1717840,1725279,i'm capable well they'll never know  they'll never see that sunset
dVWzNZp6YiU,1725279,1734320,beyond those metaphorical city walls  because they never truly believed in  themselves they never opened that gate
dVWzNZp6YiU,1734320,1739840,look i went through 16 years of  education without a teacher or professor
dVWzNZp6YiU,1739840,1745760,telling me eddie 99 of life is just  believing in yourself to figure
dVWzNZp6YiU,1745760,1752640,challenges out as they come  to figure life out as it comes that's it
dVWzNZp6YiU,1752640,1759919,only x percent make it through law  school only why percent succeed at this  and that that's what you hear but no
dVWzNZp6YiU,1759919,1766240,none of that matters  it's simple it's simple it's simple most  of the world quits when things get
dVWzNZp6YiU,1766240,1772240,challenging if you don't if you have the  courage to believe in trust in yourself
dVWzNZp6YiU,1772240,1777360,you'll succeed  why because you won't stop until you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1777360,1784320,find a way that's the power of  self-belief it's not quantum physics  it's not complex
dVWzNZp6YiU,1784320,1790320,you know at one point  i didn't think i could make a living  outside of a cubicle or office building
dVWzNZp6YiU,1790320,1796000,then i saw others do it  and for the first time in my life i  believed it was possible i changed my
dVWzNZp6YiU,1796000,1801360,actions to support my beliefs and here  we are at one point i didn't think
dVWzNZp6YiU,1801360,1807360,certain financial goals were reality i  didn't know about a free flexible  lifestyle i wasn't aware of the type of
dVWzNZp6YiU,1807360,1813919,relationships that would change my life  why because they existed outside those
dVWzNZp6YiU,1813919,1820399,city walls  i didn't believe they were real i didn't  believe in myself
dVWzNZp6YiU,1820399,1827600,to create them to make them in my own  life but with the change in belief comes  a change in reality
dVWzNZp6YiU,1827600,1834080,you will always follow through on who  you believe you are
dVWzNZp6YiU,1834559,1840000,so let's go back to that mirror  visualization  at some point today look at your
dVWzNZp6YiU,1840000,1845200,reflection and think about nothing but  what i'm about to tell you everything
dVWzNZp6YiU,1845200,1850320,you need you have  i promise you you are equipped to change
dVWzNZp6YiU,1850320,1855360,your life the lives of everyone around  you and the world in which you exist so
dVWzNZp6YiU,1855360,1860480,take that back  feel it and never ask it again from now
dVWzNZp6YiU,1860480,1866159,on the question is how  your fate is not a a coin flip it's a
dVWzNZp6YiU,1866159,1871919,puzzle it's about arranging the pieces  and those two eyes looking back at you
dVWzNZp6YiU,1871919,1878960,are more than capable of figuring that  out ask simply  do you want it
dVWzNZp6YiU,1878960,1884720,and if yes open that front door take  that first step and inject yourself into
dVWzNZp6YiU,1884720,1889919,a journey that will be unlike anything  you've ever experienced before
dVWzNZp6YiU,1889919,1896880,a journey where you have the answers the  aptitude and now the self-belief and
dVWzNZp6YiU,1896880,1902559,when you find yourself in the lowest of  lows or the darkest of nights find
dVWzNZp6YiU,1902559,1907679,solace in that fact that that will be  more than enough
dVWzNZp6YiU,1907679,1912120,to get you to dawn
dVWzNZp6YiU,1914630,1921279,[Applause]  [Music]
dVWzNZp6YiU,1934720,1940480,there's a story about some frogs  and uh  you know these frogs as they're sort of
dVWzNZp6YiU,1940480,1947279,making their way through the woods  the ground breaks underneath them and  two of them fall into this little pit
dVWzNZp6YiU,1947279,1953360,way way way down they tumble and  eventually they hit  the bottom they're looking up and
dVWzNZp6YiU,1953360,1959840,they're realizing how far they've fallen  right moving around panicking  uh essentially coming to grips with the
dVWzNZp6YiU,1959840,1965120,situation that they're now in they start  frantically jumping trying to to climb
dVWzNZp6YiU,1965120,1972159,the walls  and as they're jumping  the frogs on top are looking down
dVWzNZp6YiU,1972159,1977919,and  they're basically yelling look we're  sorry this happened to you but this is a
dVWzNZp6YiU,1977919,1984480,lost cause there's no way out for you  guys there's no need to jump around this  is a futile situation
dVWzNZp6YiU,1984480,1990559,right but they continue to jump and  they're jumped not willing to come to  terms with that possibility not yet
dVWzNZp6YiU,1990559,1997200,and again  the frogs up top they yell down  you know there's no way
dVWzNZp6YiU,1997200,2003120,it's over you're going to die down there  guys you need to ultimately face that
dVWzNZp6YiU,2003120,2010799,and one of the two frogs in the pit does  concede to the situation he hears the  voices and you know he stops jumping and
dVWzNZp6YiU,2010799,2016640,makes his way further down the pit and  he dies  but the second one the second one keeps
dVWzNZp6YiU,2016640,2022559,jumping and jumping and adjusting his  approach  trying different things
dVWzNZp6YiU,2022559,2029440,ultimately he does get out he climbs  over the ledge and when he gets to the  top he's confronted by the others
dVWzNZp6YiU,2029440,2034880,and they they come up to him they ask  him hey didn't you hear us yelling down  that the situation was impossible didn't
dVWzNZp6YiU,2034880,2040240,you hear us say there was no way out  and as it turns out he didn't hear
dVWzNZp6YiU,2040240,2045279,because this frog was deaf right so he  couldn't hear a single word
dVWzNZp6YiU,2045279,2052638,and this ultimately saved his life  [Music]  not because it helped him do the  miraculous or the impossible
dVWzNZp6YiU,2052638,2060398,but because it blocked out the outside  voices  attempting to tell him what possible
dVWzNZp6YiU,2060398,2068480,is  look there will always be doubters  skeptics and cynics as aristotle said
dVWzNZp6YiU,2068480,2075839,there is one way to avoid criticism  do nothing say nothing and be nothing
dVWzNZp6YiU,2075839,2082000,but the beauty is that these voices have  one thing in common and that's their  irrelevance
dVWzNZp6YiU,2082000,2089760,because there's one voice that matters  in the writing of your story and that  voice belongs to you
dVWzNZp6YiU,2089760,2096158,never forget how much control you have  never forget who holds the pen
dVWzNZp6YiU,2096158,2103119,things are real when you make them real  things stop when you stop things change  when you change them
dVWzNZp6YiU,2103119,2109440,so here's the following not orders or  expectations  but that spark that guides you to what
dVWzNZp6YiU,2109440,2116920,feels right so what means the most  here's to an everlasting self-belief
dVWzNZp6YiU,2117119,2124480,that will lift you out  of any hole  carry you over any mountain
dVWzNZp6YiU,2124480,2134519,and most importantly turn blank pages  into a story that is truly yours
dVWzNZp6YiU,2147920,2150000,you
