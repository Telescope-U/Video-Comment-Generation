dqTTojTija8,30,2030,Albert Einstein once said
dqTTojTija8,2030,2530, 
dqTTojTija8,2530,7588,"Everybody's a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree"
dqTTojTija8,8470,10470,It will live it's whole life believing
dqTTojTija8,11139,13139,That it is stupid
dqTTojTija8,13210,17520,Ladies and gentlemen of the jury today on trial. We have Modern-day schooling
dqTTojTija8,17800,25470,"Glad you could come not only does he make fish climb trees, but also makes them climb down and do it [10-mile] run"
dqTTojTija8,25990,28799,Tell me school. Are you proud of the things you've done?
dqTTojTija8,29500,33660,Turning millions of people into robots. Do you find that fun?
dqTTojTija8,34090,41099,Do you realize how many kids relate to that fish swimming upstream in class never finding their gifts thinking?
dqTTojTija8,41100,46320,They are stupid believing. They are useless. Well the time has come no more excuses
dqTTojTija8,46320,49799,[I] call school to the stand and accuse him of killing creativity
dqTTojTija8,50620,56460,Individuality and being intellectually abusive. He's an ancient institution that has outlived his usage
dqTTojTija8,56530,63030,"So your honor this concludes my opening statement, and if I may present the evidence of my case, I will prove it"
dqTTojTija8,63549,67199,Proceed exhibit a here's a Modern day [phone] recognize it
dqTTojTija8,67200,71430,Here's a fall from 150 years ago big difference right stay with me
dqTTojTija8,71430,75809,Here's a car from today and here's a car from 150 years ago big difference
dqTTojTija8,75810,79589,"right. Well get this, here's a classroom of today, and here's a class we use"
dqTTojTija8,80740,82298,150 Years ago
dqTTojTija8,82299,89489,Now ain't that a shame and literally more than a century nothing has changed yet. You claim to prepare students for the future?!
dqTTojTija8,90220,91740,But what evidence like that?
dqTTojTija8,91740,95578,I must ask do you prepare students for the future or the past?
dqTTojTija8,95770,101610,I did a background check on you and let the record show that you were made to train people to work in factories
dqTTojTija8,101770,107789,Which explains why you put students in straight roles nice and neat tell them sit still raise your hand if you want to speak give
dqTTojTija8,107790,109100,'em a short break to eat and for
dqTTojTija8,109100,115669,eight hours a day tell him what to think. Oh! and make them compete to get an [A]. A letter which Determines product quality hits
dqTTojTija8,115799,120559,great a of meat. I get it back then times were different. We all have a past
dqTTojTija8,120560,122750,"I myself am no Gandhi, but today"
dqTTojTija8,122750,128449,We don't need to make robots-zombies. The world has progressed and now we need people who think creatively
dqTTojTija8,128789,129450,innovatively
dqTTojTija8,129450,130200,critically
dqTTojTija8,130200,132200,independently with the ability to connect
dqTTojTija8,132330,139190,See every scientist will tell you that no two brains are the same and every parent with two or more children will confirm that claim
dqTTojTija8,139350,146119,So please explain why you treat students like cookie cutter frames or snapback hats giving them this one-size-Fits-all
dqTTojTija8,146580,147709,crap [Judge: Watch your Language]
dqTTojTija8,147709,148459,Sorry your honor
dqTTojTija8,148459,153139,but if a doctor prescribed the exact same medicine to all of his patients
dqTTojTija8,153420,159979,The results will be tragic so many people would get sick yet when it comes to school. This is exactly what happens this
dqTTojTija8,160650,167209,Educational malpractice where one teacher stands in front of 20 kids each one having different strains different needs different
dqTTojTija8,167400,171920,Gifts different dreams and you teach the same thing the same way. That's horrific.
dqTTojTija8,172470,177470,Ladies and gentlemen the defendant should not be acquitted this may be one of the worst criminal offenses ever
dqTTojTija8,177690,180799,To be committed and let's mention the way you treat your employees
dqTTojTija8,181680,184219,Objection overruled. [Judge:I want to hear this]. It's a shame
dqTTojTija8,184860,188160,Mean teachers have the most important job on the planet yet. They're underpaid
dqTTojTija8,188680,192629,No wonder so many students are short change let's be honest
dqTTojTija8,192880,199139,Teachers should earn just as much as doctors because a doctor can do heart surgery and save the life of a kid
dqTTojTija8,199270,204029,But a great teacher can reach the heart of that kid and allow him to truly live
dqTTojTija8,204280,210750,"See teachers are heroes that often get blamed, but they're not the problem. They work in a system without many options on the wrights"
dqTTojTija8,211270,217350,curriculums are created by policy [makers] most of which have never taught a day in their life just obsessed with
dqTTojTija8,217600,221129,Standardized tests they think bubbling in a multiple-choice question will determine
dqTTojTija8,221560,227160,Success that's Outlandish in fact these tests are too crude to be used and [should] be abandoned
dqTTojTija8,227160,229739,But don't take my word for it. Take Frederick J
dqTTojTija8,229739,231459,Kelley the man who invented
dqTTojTija8,231459,233130,"standardized testing who said, and i quote,"
dqTTojTija8,233130,238619,And I hoped these tests are too crude to be used and should be abandoned ladies and gentlemen of the jury
dqTTojTija8,238690,242009,If we continue down this road the results will be Lethal
dqTTojTija8,242190,245669,"I don't have much faith in school, but I do have faith in people"
dqTTojTija8,245670,251760,"And if we can customize health care,  cars and Facebook pages, then it is our duty to do the same for"
dqTTojTija8,252130,255689,education to upgrade and change and do away with school spirit
dqTTojTija8,255940,262260,'cuz that's useless unless we're working to bring the spirit out of each and every student that should be our task
dqTTojTija8,262419,264599,no more common core instead
dqTTojTija8,264600,271529,"Let's reach the core of every heart in every class sure math is important, but no more than art or dance"
dqTTojTija8,271530,273600,Let's give every gift an equal chance
dqTTojTija8,273600,275260,I know this sounds like a dream
dqTTojTija8,275260,282119,"but countries like Finland are doing impressive things they have shorter school days, teachers make a decent wage homework is"
dqTTojTija8,282700,284700,Non-existent and they focus on collaboration
dqTTojTija8,285100,289439,"Instead of competition, but here's the kicker boys and girls their educational system"
dqTTojTija8,290229,296909,"outperforms every other country in the world. Other places like Singapore, succeeding rapidly schools like"
dqTTojTija8,297250,300690,Montessori programs like Khan academy there is no single solution
dqTTojTija8,301060,305729,But let's get moving because while students may be 20% of our population
dqTTojTija8,305830,312270,They are 100% of our future so let's attend to their dreams. There's no telling where we can achieve
dqTTojTija8,312880,319200,This is a world in which I believe a world where fish are no longer forced to climb trees
dqTTojTija8,320500,322500,I rest my case. [Applause]
dqTTojTija8,333860,338110,"Hey guys, my name is Prince Ea and I want to say thank you so much for watching my video"
dqTTojTija8,338120,341949,But now I wouldn't know what you think how can we together?
dqTTojTija8,342530,346870,Create a more efficient effective and just better future of learning
dqTTojTija8,346870,354189,I want you to visit neste.com/preorderthefuture and share your thoughts and ideas on the topic peace...
dqTTojTija8,359300,361300,Paradox was here....
