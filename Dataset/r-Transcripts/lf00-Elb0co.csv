lf00-Elb0co,8160,9960,alright so here's what's to come for
lf00-Elb0co,9960,12420,passional 4.0 demon fall so we have the
lf00-Elb0co,12420,14280,antengu blood Demar which is gonna be a
lf00-Elb0co,14280,16859,rare so we have the okaza The Ice guitar
lf00-Elb0co,16859,19199,sickles those are red bdas not only that
lf00-Elb0co,19199,20880,though we're having another rare bloody
lf00-Elb0co,20880,22680,mod which is going to be hitengu I'm not
lf00-Elb0co,22680,24480,sure if dakibi is rare but let me know
lf00-Elb0co,24480,26220,in the comment section if it is rare I
lf00-Elb0co,26220,27599,don't know on top of that though we
lf00-Elb0co,27599,29279,might even get a second bloody Mark
lf00-Elb0co,29279,31380,swamp PDA is coming to team fall if
lf00-Elb0co,31380,32700,everything goes well but we're finally
lf00-Elb0co,32700,34260,getting the demon file history line I
lf00-Elb0co,34260,35760,really hope so because last update we
lf00-Elb0co,35760,37440,didn't get it so so I really hope this
lf00-Elb0co,37440,39000,time we do get the demon file history
lf00-Elb0co,39000,40680,line I really want it to be like a
lf00-Elb0co,40680,42180,defending Infinity Castle I'm not sure
lf00-Elb0co,42180,43680,that makes sense or like if we fight
lf00-Elb0co,43680,45899,like yomi with kokushibo you know what
lf00-Elb0co,45899,46860,I'm saying man I don't know maybe really
lf00-Elb0co,46860,48120,cool let me know in the comment section
lf00-Elb0co,48120,49620,or what you think the demon file history
lf00-Elb0co,49620,51480,line could be all right balance Miss we
lf00-Elb0co,51480,53399,have the nerf yurichi wave 20. like
lf00-Elb0co,53399,55140,yurichi on the boss series is pretty
lf00-Elb0co,55140,56699,much impossible I'm really happy the
lf00-Elb0co,56699,59219,kind of nerfed yurichiwi 20. Doki whip
lf00-Elb0co,59219,61620,skill damage increase by 20 in speed by
lf00-Elb0co,61620,63239,fifty percent I'm really happy about the
lf00-Elb0co,63239,64978,speed because the document is speed the
lf00-Elb0co,64978,67619,daki BDM ones are just so bad so I
lf00-Elb0co,67619,69540,really hope they fixed the m1s it's so
lf00-Elb0co,69540,70920,bad to the point while you're being M1
lf00-Elb0co,70920,72299,so you can escape the combo it's
lf00-Elb0co,72299,73740,actually ridiculous and after that we
lf00-Elb0co,73740,75840,have the daki 8 layer damage increased
lf00-Elb0co,75840,78299,by 50 so so the ducky beauty is gonna
lf00-Elb0co,78299,80700,get a nice buff so overall a huge W for
