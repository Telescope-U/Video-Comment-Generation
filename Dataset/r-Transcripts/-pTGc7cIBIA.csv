-pTGc7cIBIA,518,3100,(upbeat music)
-pTGc7cIBIA,6200,7960,"- Okay, what's up?"
-pTGc7cIBIA,7960,8793,MKBND here.
-pTGc7cIBIA,8793,13450,"So this is a sort of everyday carry what's in my bag,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,13450,17100,what's on my daily driver tech type video.
-pTGc7cIBIA,17100,19130,"I've done these in the past and a lot of you kept asking,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,19130,20240,when am I gonna do another one?
-pTGc7cIBIA,20240,22500,When am I gonna do the 2022 updated version?
-pTGc7cIBIA,22500,24590,'Cause I hadn't done one in like a year.
-pTGc7cIBIA,24590,28110,"Honestly, I think most of the stuff that I'm using"
-pTGc7cIBIA,28110,30440,is very similar to the last one
-pTGc7cIBIA,30440,32230,but there are some small upgrades.
-pTGc7cIBIA,32230,33750,So I'm gonna show you what those upgrades
-pTGc7cIBIA,33750,35970,are that I personally use anyway.
-pTGc7cIBIA,35970,38180,And I'm gonna show you what's on my devices.
-pTGc7cIBIA,38180,39020,So this is the backpack.
-pTGc7cIBIA,39020,42070,This is the Peak Design everyday carry 20 liter.
-pTGc7cIBIA,42070,43250,So there's a 30 liter also.
-pTGc7cIBIA,43250,45440,That's pretty massive and great for travel
-pTGc7cIBIA,45440,47210,but this is just for everyday.
-pTGc7cIBIA,47210,49280,I definitely fit everything I need into this backpack.
-pTGc7cIBIA,49280,51870,"I've tried other bags in the past, different shapes,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,51870,52980,different layouts.
-pTGc7cIBIA,52980,54350,This is the one I always come back to.
-pTGc7cIBIA,54350,56019,"And as you can tell, it's a little bit different from any of"
-pTGc7cIBIA,56020,58280,the ones you'll find on their website because it's black
-pTGc7cIBIA,58280,60260,with this red stitching.
-pTGc7cIBIA,60260,63440,There's some red stitching on the inside here.
-pTGc7cIBIA,63440,64920,You can't get that from them.
-pTGc7cIBIA,64920,68229,There's also an MKBHD patch at the bottom.
-pTGc7cIBIA,68230,71464,It's the MKBHD edition of the bag that only I
-pTGc7cIBIA,71464,73820,and some people here at the studio have.
-pTGc7cIBIA,73820,76530,Really it's designed to be a photography bag.
-pTGc7cIBIA,76530,79860,It has zippers along the side so you can turn it sideways
-pTGc7cIBIA,79860,82430,and open it like that if you want to.
-pTGc7cIBIA,82430,84480,It's my matte black water bottle.
-pTGc7cIBIA,84480,85750,"Stay hydrated, people."
-pTGc7cIBIA,85750,88490,Got this as a gift from my family on Christmas
-pTGc7cIBIA,88490,90130,but the rest of the stuff in here
-pTGc7cIBIA,90130,92826,is mostly just everyday carry stuff.
-pTGc7cIBIA,92827,97050,"I'm gonna start at the top, and that's the back compartment."
-pTGc7cIBIA,97050,99120,Love the way this bag is laid out.
-pTGc7cIBIA,99120,101850,"But here is the laptop of choice,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,101850,106643,which is the 16 inch M1 Max MacBook Pro.
-pTGc7cIBIA,107490,109310,"I reviewed the thing, I've talked about it,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,109310,110680,I love it clearly.
-pTGc7cIBIA,110680,114120,I went with the 16 inch because for the first time
-pTGc7cIBIA,114120,119120,I am actually editing videos away from my desk.
-pTGc7cIBIA,119510,123427,"I've taken this home edited videos on a couch,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,123427,127570,"at a table, just random other places, which is crazy."
-pTGc7cIBIA,127570,129820,"The 14 inch screen, it's a great laptop."
-pTGc7cIBIA,129820,131596,It's just a little too small.
-pTGc7cIBIA,131596,133840,So this is the laptop I've actually edited videos on.
-pTGc7cIBIA,133840,135519,So then the backpack up top here has a bunch
-pTGc7cIBIA,135520,138850,"of other small pockets, got a microfiber in here."
-pTGc7cIBIA,138850,141634,And I just realized I also still have from last time
-pTGc7cIBIA,141634,144853,the SD card reader but since this...
-pTGc7cIBIA,144853,149853,"I don't, don't need that but that's it for the top."
-pTGc7cIBIA,149870,151989,So then there's this buckle at the top
-pTGc7cIBIA,151990,154670,that lets you get into the top section.
-pTGc7cIBIA,154670,156240,There's three sections.
-pTGc7cIBIA,156240,158750,So up top is the stuff I use the most.
-pTGc7cIBIA,158750,161850,"MagSafe charger for the laptop, of course."
-pTGc7cIBIA,161850,164930,And these are the headphones that I've traveled a lot with.
-pTGc7cIBIA,164930,166530,So anytime I travel
-pTGc7cIBIA,166530,170080,I typically need noise canceling and wireless.
-pTGc7cIBIA,170080,171890,That's the ideal go-to.
-pTGc7cIBIA,171890,175590,And so AirPods Max paired with the whole ecosystem
-pTGc7cIBIA,175590,177019,"of Apple products, of course."
-pTGc7cIBIA,177020,178110,And they're in space gray.
-pTGc7cIBIA,178110,181670,"So then I also have my car keys and other keys,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,181670,183590,which have AirTag on them.
-pTGc7cIBIA,183590,188470,"And then two more things, the body cap for the Canon R5,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,188470,192420,which is a bit of a spoiler alert to what's in the bag.
-pTGc7cIBIA,192420,195849,"And then this is a webcam, this is called the Opal C1."
-pTGc7cIBIA,195849,198770,"Disclaimer, I'm an investor in this company"
-pTGc7cIBIA,198770,201180,and I've been checking this out for a little while now
-pTGc7cIBIA,201180,202519,but I really believe in it.
-pTGc7cIBIA,202520,205160,And this is just a webcam that they've made.
-pTGc7cIBIA,205160,207920,"For the amount of video calls that we're on lately,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,207920,210500,I tend to get a lot of use out of that thing.
-pTGc7cIBIA,210500,213390,So that's in my backpack and that's it.
-pTGc7cIBIA,213390,215040,Now I'm gonna go bottom section.
-pTGc7cIBIA,215040,217463,"This is what you'd do in a photographer bag, ready?"
-pTGc7cIBIA,218470,220051,Just like that.
-pTGc7cIBIA,220051,221825,(metal teeth zipping)
-pTGc7cIBIA,221826,222810,And you can get it into the side.
-pTGc7cIBIA,222810,226720,"So as a photographer bag, you've got photographer things."
-pTGc7cIBIA,226720,228690,I don't always carry this with me
-pTGc7cIBIA,228690,231710,"but when I do carry a camera on the go,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,231710,234737,I typically will take Canon's R5.
-pTGc7cIBIA,234737,237610,I also traveled with this exact same bag
-pTGc7cIBIA,237610,240040,when I went to shoot that Mr. Beast video.
-pTGc7cIBIA,240040,241890,Or for a couple of other shoots where I know I'm doing a lot
-pTGc7cIBIA,241890,243957,"of videos, I've taken the Sony A1."
-pTGc7cIBIA,243957,247470,"But for everyday stuff where I like take a lot of photos,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,247470,251540,Canon R5 with the 15 to 35 is my go-to.
-pTGc7cIBIA,251540,254450,A lot of first-person shots with wide angle stuff.
-pTGc7cIBIA,254450,256680,"And then last but not least at the bottom here,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,256680,260299,there's a bunch of charging related stuff.
-pTGc7cIBIA,260299,262009,Spread out the rest of this backpack.
-pTGc7cIBIA,262010,264130,So I've got two cables.
-pTGc7cIBIA,264130,266356,One is my USB-C to Lightning Cable.
-pTGc7cIBIA,266356,269199,"And then the other is, actually this is super cool"
-pTGc7cIBIA,269200,270120,that I just found recently.
-pTGc7cIBIA,270120,273699,This is a USB-C cable and there was a little display
-pTGc7cIBIA,273700,274980,on the end of the cable.
-pTGc7cIBIA,274980,277380,"And when you plug something in that starts drawing power,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,277380,280479,this display lights up with the exact wattage
-pTGc7cIBIA,280479,282310,that that thing is drawing.
-pTGc7cIBIA,282310,284950,So it's kind of a nice little indicator of how much power
-pTGc7cIBIA,284950,288970,"you're getting out of your wall brick, which is pretty cool."
-pTGc7cIBIA,288970,290480,Didn't think I would care that much about
-pTGc7cIBIA,290480,292920,"that sort of thing, but I like it a lot."
-pTGc7cIBIA,292920,296780,"Then this is the wall brick for USB-C but that's just,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,296780,299260,this is just like the classic one that's built in
-pTGc7cIBIA,299260,300670,that Apple will give you.
-pTGc7cIBIA,300670,305670,I have over here in this pocket a slim one.
-pTGc7cIBIA,306260,307710,This is made by RealMe.
-pTGc7cIBIA,307710,309139,I don't even know if they sell it.
-pTGc7cIBIA,309140,312030,I'll try to link everything below that is on sale.
-pTGc7cIBIA,312030,313590,if you wanna pick up any of this stuff.
-pTGc7cIBIA,313590,315199,but it's a Dart charger.
-pTGc7cIBIA,315200,318740,And I think it's about 50 watts and it's a slim charger.
-pTGc7cIBIA,318740,320289,So you can just plug it into the wall
-pTGc7cIBIA,320290,322800,"just like that, USB-C at the bottom."
-pTGc7cIBIA,322800,325229,"And so anytime I'm traveling at a hotel or any place,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,325230,329990,"I just need to plug something in boom, boom, charged."
-pTGc7cIBIA,329990,334500,"Otherwise over here, I've got my Apple Watch charger"
-pTGc7cIBIA,334500,336830,and this is the sad part that they haven't made
-pTGc7cIBIA,336830,340095,a new version of MagSafe Duo that supports
-pTGc7cIBIA,340095,344140,the Apple Watch series seven's faster charging.
-pTGc7cIBIA,344140,349140,"So sadly, I also carry the faster metal puck charger"
-pTGc7cIBIA,350240,352539,if I actually needed to charge faster.
-pTGc7cIBIA,352540,354040,This is all nerdy stuff.
-pTGc7cIBIA,354040,355330,It probably doesn't matter for most people
-pTGc7cIBIA,355330,357490,but Apple Watch chargers.
-pTGc7cIBIA,357490,358991,Then on the other side.
-pTGc7cIBIA,358991,361130,(metal teeth zipping)
-pTGc7cIBIA,361130,362150,Just some pens.
-pTGc7cIBIA,362150,364570,I typically don't write things with pens very often
-pTGc7cIBIA,364570,367550,but if I need to sign something or write a check
-pTGc7cIBIA,367550,369300,or whatever that's easy.
-pTGc7cIBIA,369300,373535,"And then down here, ah, yes, my adapter,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,373536,377253,my Lightning to headphone jack adapter that I still have.
-pTGc7cIBIA,378360,379490,That's it.
-pTGc7cIBIA,379490,380323,That's it for the bag.
-pTGc7cIBIA,380323,381260,It's empty.
-pTGc7cIBIA,381260,383610,And that's all I really typically ever carry.
-pTGc7cIBIA,383610,385900,"Again, like I said, camera is in there sometimes,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,385900,386919,isn't there other times.
-pTGc7cIBIA,386920,389860,Everything else is always in the bag
-pTGc7cIBIA,389860,391496,but I've got pockets too.
-pTGc7cIBIA,391497,393039,Let's do the pockets
-pTGc7cIBIA,393039,395622,(upbeat music)
-pTGc7cIBIA,397195,399612,"Okay, three pockets actually."
-pTGc7cIBIA,400690,402380,"So as far as everyday carry is concerned,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,402380,405070,"I do have a back pocket and that's where I keep my wallet,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,405070,406560,"which is this little guy, pretty simple."
-pTGc7cIBIA,406560,409210,It is a TROVE wallet so I'll link this below.
-pTGc7cIBIA,409210,413190,"Although, this is again an MKBHD carbon blacked out edition,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,413190,414400,which is pretty sick.
-pTGc7cIBIA,414400,417889,"Although whole right side up thing,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,417890,419990,I feel like this is right side up.
-pTGc7cIBIA,419990,423077,But all the text has this being right side up.
-pTGc7cIBIA,423077,424860,Matte black everything.
-pTGc7cIBIA,424860,426550,"Anyway, but inside it, I don't carry much."
-pTGc7cIBIA,426550,428050,I clearly don't carry a lot in my wallet.
-pTGc7cIBIA,428050,432620,I don't have cash but this is dbrand's skinned key card
-pTGc7cIBIA,432620,433900,to get into the studio.
-pTGc7cIBIA,433900,434970,Very useful to have.
-pTGc7cIBIA,434970,438400,And then this is just a little backup key to get into
-pTGc7cIBIA,438400,440979,"the car, which actually uses the phone"
-pTGc7cIBIA,440980,443840,and a Bluetooth signal as the key.
-pTGc7cIBIA,443840,446580,So in case my phone is dead or something like that
-pTGc7cIBIA,446580,448750,"or it's bugging out, which that happens sometimes too."
-pTGc7cIBIA,448750,453750,So that's the wallet and then two daily driver smartphones.
-pTGc7cIBIA,454630,457870,I've told this story before but I pretty much always carry
-pTGc7cIBIA,457870,461410,"an Android phone and an iPhone, one in each pocket."
-pTGc7cIBIA,461410,463420,It's always the Android phone on the right side
-pTGc7cIBIA,463420,464640,and the iPhone in the left side.
-pTGc7cIBIA,464640,467230,"And that's just because I'm always in both worlds,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,467230,469560,"both ecosystems, I'm always testing both things."
-pTGc7cIBIA,469560,471820,Now the iPhone has the most continuity
-pTGc7cIBIA,471820,474690,because it only changes once or twice a year
-pTGc7cIBIA,474690,476000,when I'm testing the new iPhones.
-pTGc7cIBIA,476000,480960,"But I'm carrying an iPhone 13 Pro, not the Pro Max actually."
-pTGc7cIBIA,480960,482259,I downsized.
-pTGc7cIBIA,482260,485150,"So this is the one terabyte, space gray version though."
-pTGc7cIBIA,485150,487470,I found that with the amount of ProRes video
-pTGc7cIBIA,487470,489100,"that I shoot on this thing, it helps."
-pTGc7cIBIA,489100,491270,I shot the whole Rivian video on this phone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,491270,493919,So I'll go over the setup on the iPhone in a second
-pTGc7cIBIA,493920,495910,"but I'm gonna start with the Android phone,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,495910,499090,which at the moment is the Pixel 6 Pro.
-pTGc7cIBIA,499090,500400,It's been a couple months now.
-pTGc7cIBIA,500400,505400,This phone it's fine but it's definitely getting more buggy
-pTGc7cIBIA,505510,510000,"than when it started, which is really odd and annoying."
-pTGc7cIBIA,510000,512360,"So I don't know if this has happened with Pixels before,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,512360,515500,but as I fire it up this is the setup that
-pTGc7cIBIA,515500,517289,you're probably so used to seeing.
-pTGc7cIBIA,517289,518949,I've had this wallpaper for awhile.
-pTGc7cIBIA,518950,520960,I've had roughly this set up on the phones for a while
-pTGc7cIBIA,520960,522180,but I'm gonna give some shout outs to some
-pTGc7cIBIA,522180,524920,of my favorite things I'm doing on the phone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,524920,526889,So it's got the weather wedgie in the middle.
-pTGc7cIBIA,526890,527723,That's cool.
-pTGc7cIBIA,527723,531760,It seems to really want to go to 60hz all the time
-pTGc7cIBIA,531760,536140,"even though I have, let's see, I have a 20hz turned on."
-pTGc7cIBIA,536140,538430,"Yep, still on, which is kind of annoying"
-pTGc7cIBIA,538430,542860,"but the apps are phone, messaging, Tesla, Flamingo."
-pTGc7cIBIA,542860,546079,I have the Flamingo for Twitter app still
-pTGc7cIBIA,546080,549030,on my Android phones because it's a Twitter app
-pTGc7cIBIA,549030,551150,that I really like that ran out of tokens.
-pTGc7cIBIA,551150,553530,And is only available to sign in for people
-pTGc7cIBIA,553530,556500,who already have a token on their Twitter account.
-pTGc7cIBIA,556500,558210,So most people don't use Flamingo for Twitter.
-pTGc7cIBIA,558210,560280,I use the regular Twitter app for notifications
-pTGc7cIBIA,560280,563840,but I use Flamingo just because it's clean and looks great
-pTGc7cIBIA,563840,566840,for scrolling around and just reading tweets.
-pTGc7cIBIA,566840,571597,"Then I have my favorite app, I think, of the entire year,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,571597,573010,which is my to-do app.
-pTGc7cIBIA,573010,574080,It's called TickTick.
-pTGc7cIBIA,574080,576380,And I feel like these really good to-do apps
-pTGc7cIBIA,576380,577360,don't get enough credit.
-pTGc7cIBIA,577360,579480,"I mean, I'm doing a lot of things."
-pTGc7cIBIA,579480,583100,I'm trying to keep track of a lot of different simultaneous
-pTGc7cIBIA,583100,586350,and parallel projects and having a single place
-pTGc7cIBIA,586350,589050,to put all that information is super helpful for me.
-pTGc7cIBIA,589050,592130,So I have it all divided and organized in here
-pTGc7cIBIA,592130,597130,and I've tried pretty much every to-do list app that's out.
-pTGc7cIBIA,597240,599339,And I found TickTick is the best.
-pTGc7cIBIA,599340,600980,"At least it's my favorite, I really like it."
-pTGc7cIBIA,600980,603139,"The UI is great, the features are great."
-pTGc7cIBIA,603140,606690,"It also has a focus planner, it has a Pomodoro Timer."
-pTGc7cIBIA,606690,609540,It's got a whole bunch of extra stuff you might find useful.
-pTGc7cIBIA,609540,610910,"Definitely, check out TickTick."
-pTGc7cIBIA,610910,613850,"And then above that, I have a bunch of my most recently used"
-pTGc7cIBIA,613850,616787,"or frequently used apps, Relay Pro for Reddit."
-pTGc7cIBIA,616787,619149,You can get any number of different Reddit apps
-pTGc7cIBIA,619150,620900,"but I've just gotten really used to Relay Pro,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,620900,621880,which is great.
-pTGc7cIBIA,621880,625160,"Instagram, Spotify, YouTube Studio app"
-pTGc7cIBIA,625160,627199,"and then four of my most used Google apps,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,627200,628820,"which are YouTube, Google Drive."
-pTGc7cIBIA,628820,632583,"The Gmail stock app, I think is good and Google photos."
-pTGc7cIBIA,633680,636300,"Then over here, I've got a calendar widget."
-pTGc7cIBIA,636300,638700,I'm gonna try to link that one 'cause it's really good.
-pTGc7cIBIA,638700,641540,"Waze for navigation, it's not pretty."
-pTGc7cIBIA,641540,643225,But it's very functional.
-pTGc7cIBIA,643225,646160,Yahoo Fantasy and Pocket Casts
-pTGc7cIBIA,646160,648920,is my pocket podcast app of choice.
-pTGc7cIBIA,648920,651220,"Then Google Keep for just remembering,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,651220,653199,jotting down random notes and stuff like that.
-pTGc7cIBIA,653200,655690,"And Slack, which we use here at the studio."
-pTGc7cIBIA,655690,656523,And then I just have like
-pTGc7cIBIA,656523,659100,"a miscellaneous fitness page over here, Tempo."
-pTGc7cIBIA,659100,662050,"If you've heard of the Tempo like home gym,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,662050,664250,that's the app that lets you plan things with it
-pTGc7cIBIA,664250,665640,and Google Fit.
-pTGc7cIBIA,665640,668600,But that's basically the most used stuff
-pTGc7cIBIA,668600,670139,on my Android phone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,670140,674930,"I mean, here's the entire app list, nothing too dramatic."
-pTGc7cIBIA,674930,677360,I don't have actually that many apps
-pTGc7cIBIA,677360,679760,and a lot of these like annoying apps like my files
-pTGc7cIBIA,679760,682240,"or my AT&T, I wish I didn't have to have those apps."
-pTGc7cIBIA,682240,684850,But they tend to be like the most useful way to interact
-pTGc7cIBIA,684850,687250,with these services so I have them.
-pTGc7cIBIA,687250,691260,"But yeah, that's the world of my Android phone"
-pTGc7cIBIA,691260,692670,at the moment.
-pTGc7cIBIA,692670,696050,This phone will probably change in a week or two.
-pTGc7cIBIA,696050,700029,I don't stick with one Android phone usually for more than
-pTGc7cIBIA,700030,702710,about a month because I'm constantly actually using
-pTGc7cIBIA,702710,705720,and putting my SIM card into the next phone I'm testing.
-pTGc7cIBIA,705720,708540,"But a phone that stays constant in the left pocket,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,708540,710470,at least with only maybe one
-pTGc7cIBIA,710470,712761,or two changes a year is the iPhone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,712761,717220,And so this is my iPhone set up a lot of overlap because
-pTGc7cIBIA,717220,719110,I use a lot of the same services.
-pTGc7cIBIA,719110,721829,"But in the iPhone world, there's a lot of stuff like"
-pTGc7cIBIA,721830,724300,"the Copilot app, which is a finance tracking app"
-pTGc7cIBIA,724300,727161,that I love and use on the iPhone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,727161,729460,"The iPhone camera app of course,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,729460,731140,got a TickTick widget up here
-pTGc7cIBIA,731140,733180,and a TickTick shortcut at the bottom
-pTGc7cIBIA,733180,735250,'cause I think it's great.
-pTGc7cIBIA,735250,738950,"But also things like Instagram, Dark Sky."
-pTGc7cIBIA,738950,743300,"God, I hate that they took Dark Sky away from Android."
-pTGc7cIBIA,743300,746279,Apple bought the Dark Sky app and now the best weather app
-pTGc7cIBIA,746280,751050,in the world is iPhone only sadly but it's really good.
-pTGc7cIBIA,751050,753200,So I keep that here and I use it a lot.
-pTGc7cIBIA,753200,757120,"Tweetbot for Twitter, the Twitter app or the Tesla app"
-pTGc7cIBIA,757120,760089,"for opening and closing the car door, things like that."
-pTGc7cIBIA,760090,762450,We have to use a third party app
-pTGc7cIBIA,762450,765330,for group fitness challenges at the studio.
-pTGc7cIBIA,765330,768260,So the Challenges app does exactly that.
-pTGc7cIBIA,768260,770990,"Hopefully, someday Apple can build that in."
-pTGc7cIBIA,770990,773720,So anyone with an Apple Watch can join a group competition.
-pTGc7cIBIA,773720,774553,That'd be cool.
-pTGc7cIBIA,774553,776269,"Yeah, weather widget, nothing too crazy here."
-pTGc7cIBIA,776270,779870,And then this is that app library screen.
-pTGc7cIBIA,779870,782120,I do have Among Us on my phone.
-pTGc7cIBIA,782120,783610,"I have this app, what's this called again?"
-pTGc7cIBIA,783610,786120,"Hemisphere, probably my favorite game."
-pTGc7cIBIA,786120,787960,"It's really good for just burning time on a plane,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,787960,790300,where basically you start off as this orb.
-pTGc7cIBIA,790300,792490,And you go around and you basically just try
-pTGc7cIBIA,792490,796461,"to absorb every orb that's smaller than you, pretty classic."
-pTGc7cIBIA,796461,801461,"Just become the biggest, eject, move over, move over."
-pTGc7cIBIA,803820,804700,You get the idea.
-pTGc7cIBIA,804700,805870,It's really addicting though.
-pTGc7cIBIA,805870,810551,I've gotten a lot of hours sunken into this app
-pTGc7cIBIA,810551,814784,"but yeah, the Chipotle app, good stuff."
-pTGc7cIBIA,814784,818112,"The Google Home app, no surprises there."
-pTGc7cIBIA,818112,822900,And that's what's on my two phones that I'm carrying with me
-pTGc7cIBIA,822900,826837,on this exact date in January of 2022.
-pTGc7cIBIA,826837,829300,"So yeah, that's pretty much it."
-pTGc7cIBIA,829300,831029,You guys asked for it so now you have it.
-pTGc7cIBIA,831030,834140,Maybe leave any suggestions you guys have for good apps
-pTGc7cIBIA,834140,837739,or good widgets or things that I'm missing out on.
-pTGc7cIBIA,837739,839677,I love TickTick.
-pTGc7cIBIA,839677,841860,I'm gonna link as many of the things I talked about in
-pTGc7cIBIA,841860,844010,this video as possible below so you can see them.
-pTGc7cIBIA,844010,848210,"But if anything else is deserving to be on my radar,"
-pTGc7cIBIA,848210,849260,let me know.
-pTGc7cIBIA,849260,850690,"Okay, that's it."
-pTGc7cIBIA,850690,852100,Thanks for watching.
-pTGc7cIBIA,852100,853899,"See you guys in the next one, peace."
