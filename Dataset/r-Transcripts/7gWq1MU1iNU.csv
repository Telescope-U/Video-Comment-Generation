7gWq1MU1iNU,5910,14040,You're in a fight between will and skill.  I say will first because that's what you are.
7gWq1MU1iNU,14040,18000,"You're locked and loaded with skill. You're practicing every day, you're putting in your work."
7gWq1MU1iNU,18000,21539,"You're buying everything, you're making investments. You're living your dream,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,21539,24840,"you're walking like your dream. You're surrounding yourself around your dream,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,24840,27570,you got mentors - everything. You're putting more work in. You got your skill.
7gWq1MU1iNU,27570,33840,Now is the test of your will. It is a mindset thing you are in right now
7gWq1MU1iNU,33840,38399,"it is a mindset thing because your challenge. Your challenge ain't moving, your"
7gWq1MU1iNU,38399,42179,"mountain,  it is not moving. You don't feel like you making any progress."

7gWq1MU1iNU,48000,53270,test of your will right now cuz life says it has a little more test for you.
7gWq1MU1iNU,53270,57809,"It's no different because we messed up, because you fell off the wagon, you've"
7gWq1MU1iNU,57809,62190,been on alcohol and drugs and you gave up on life and you dropped out or you've
7gWq1MU1iNU,62190,65489,"been to jail one time, two times, three times and you really want your dream to"
7gWq1MU1iNU,65489,70140,happen and you putting in your work and nothing's happening yet.
7gWq1MU1iNU,70140,72960,Every transformation always gets worse before it gets better.l
7gWq1MU1iNU,72960,76680,It's supposed to be that way. When you embark this journey you must know that
7gWq1MU1iNU,76680,80250,"it's gonna go down before it comes up but when it comes up, it's gonna go so"
7gWq1MU1iNU,80250,88340,"much higher than you've ever been. The action of making progress is progress. The, the"
7gWq1MU1iNU,88340,95000,"push itself, the fight, you get up and swing and miss - that's progress. You get"
7gWq1MU1iNU,95000,99170,"up and you run at - get what you want with everything you got and you miss,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,99170,106610,that's progress. The effort of making the attempt. it's progress. It must happen. It
7gWq1MU1iNU,106610,113240,can't do anything but move. You can't do anything but make progress. You're pushing
7gWq1MU1iNU,113240,117380,and you're pushing and you're pushing and you're pushing and you're doing
7gWq1MU1iNU,117380,123250,"everything right. You're tired, you're exhausted and ain't nothing happening yet."
7gWq1MU1iNU,123250,133190,"That word is what you're waiting for. 'Yet.' Because I promise you, if you keep"

7gWq1MU1iNU,140900,145129,equipped mentally to endure this process. Knowing what you're about to go into is
7gWq1MU1iNU,145130,149120,"step one. Knowing it's an uphill battle, but a winnable one and one that's"
7gWq1MU1iNU,149120,153530,"achievable and at the end of this race guys, you're going to be more capable. The"
7gWq1MU1iNU,153530,160340,"first step guys, is knowing it's a tough road. As soon as you decide to stop"
7gWq1MU1iNU,160340,165500,looking for answers in other people and miracles somewhere down the yellow brick
7gWq1MU1iNU,165500,169490,"road, and click the heels of your mind, and set your affections on"
7gWq1MU1iNU,169490,177040,"things that are above, you could have been free years ago. All"
7gWq1MU1iNU,177160,185270,"jealousy, all pettiness, all unforgiveness, all strife, all malice, all confusion, all"
7gWq1MU1iNU,185270,189770,blaming other people for your mistakes. You got till midnight to get rid of

7gWq1MU1iNU,195440,200360,what God is about to pour into your life woe be unto you if you go into
7gWq1MU1iNU,200360,206660,another year and waste another year with the old mentality while somebody in the hospital
7gWq1MU1iNU,206660,215020,begging God for the opportunity that you have right now. You better step into this moment.
7gWq1MU1iNU,218660,224430,My COMMITMENT and obsession is always to be better today than I was yesterday
7gWq1MU1iNU,224430,229620,If I have to make sacrifices to do that: so be it. If I have to tell that person I
7gWq1MU1iNU,229620,234590,can’t go out drinking with him anymore: so be it. Because that’s not what I value.
7gWq1MU1iNU,234590,239069,Anything or anyone that is taking me further away from my dreams has to go.
7gWq1MU1iNU,239070,245220,"I’m committed to self development not self destruction, and you know, any person"
7gWq1MU1iNU,245220,248370,"that is meant to be with me on the journey, will choose that higher road"
7gWq1MU1iNU,248370,254159,"with me. Yes, a tougher road, but it is also a much more rewarding one. I want my life to"
7gWq1MU1iNU,254160,258239,"mean something. To be able to look back at my life and say, yeah, I made some"
7gWq1MU1iNU,258239,263310,"tough decisions, but they were the RIGHT decisions. So many people don’t get it."
7gWq1MU1iNU,263310,267600,They piss their life away every weekend for what? So they can complain
7gWq1MU1iNU,267600,271350,about their current circumstances for the rest of the week? THERE'S NO CHANCE!
7gWq1MU1iNU,271350,280260,I’m in charge of my own life! It’s all on me! I take responsibility. I take action.
7gWq1MU1iNU,280260,284130,You will never hear me complain about another person or circumstance as the
7gWq1MU1iNU,284130,288750,reason I’m not where I want to be. If I don’t like where I am… Time to knuckle
7gWq1MU1iNU,288750,293250,down and work harder! I am a perfect reflection of the hard work or lack of
7gWq1MU1iNU,293250,298860,"work I put in. And luck, that only comes to those who have paid their dues."
7gWq1MU1iNU,298860,301770,"If I am weak in a certain area, it won’t be for long."
7gWq1MU1iNU,301770,307139,"Because I’m committed to be better. I will learn, I will read. I will make it happen."
7gWq1MU1iNU,307140,313280,I will FIND A WAY. I will WORK until that weakness is turned into a strength.
7gWq1MU1iNU,321540,326700,"No one can beat me, because i don't give up! I'm RELENTLESS! You might knock me down,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,326700,332520,but i NEVER stay down! It’s time to RISE. RISE UP to your potential!
7gWq1MU1iNU,332520,337770,RISE UP past your limitations! RISE UP past your family or friends limitations!
7gWq1MU1iNU,337770,342539,"Set the standard for those around you! Don’t conform to the standard,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,342540,349220,like a sheep. Get out and LEAD THE WAY! GET UP. RISE UP! MAN UP!
7gWq1MU1iNU,393919,399719,My college ball career was over. I got offered a job to become a hospital
7gWq1MU1iNU,399719,406129,"administrator. 2-year program, $75,000 job"
7gWq1MU1iNU,406339,412168,"and right before I took the job, my daddy called me on the phone. Let me tell you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,412169,415020,"about my daddy. When I was a little boy, my daddy would"
7gWq1MU1iNU,415020,420749,"always pick me up. When he came home from work he picked me up, when he saw me in"
7gWq1MU1iNU,420749,424768,"the nursery after church, he picked me up. No matter how long he worked, no matter"
7gWq1MU1iNU,424769,429749,"how tired he was, my dad would always pick me up. So when I had my kids, I would"
7gWq1MU1iNU,429749,434199,"always pick up my kids. When I got home, sometimes I was tired and they would have a bottle in"
7gWq1MU1iNU,434200,436200,"one hand, and they just lifted up their other hand, and they knew what"
7gWq1MU1iNU,437219,442369,"daddy was supposed to do, my job was to pick them up."
7gWq1MU1iNU,444919,449389,"This is a spiritual interaction. When you pick up a child, it is a spiritual"
7gWq1MU1iNU,449389,454900,"transaction. When you pick up a child, you change their"
7gWq1MU1iNU,454900,457900,perspective.
7gWq1MU1iNU,458750,465320,"When you pick up a child, all of a sudden they can see the world the way you see it."
7gWq1MU1iNU,465320,469670,"I don't care what your children have done, there is nothing they can do for you to stop picking"
7gWq1MU1iNU,469670,473940,"them up. Whether my daughter's a drug addict, I don't"
7gWq1MU1iNU,473940,478860,"care I pick her up.  My son messes up, I don't care"
7gWq1MU1iNU,478860,489680,pick him up. I don't care. You pick them up.
7gWq1MU1iNU,489680,494729,"That is your job, Mama. That is your job, Daddy. That is your job"
7gWq1MU1iNU,494730,501330,"grandma, that is your job granddad, your number one job is to pick them up and"
7gWq1MU1iNU,501330,506150,change their perspective.
7gWq1MU1iNU,509390,513719,"My saddest day, one day my daddy looked at me and said boy you too big, I can't pick you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,513719,520529,"up anymore but when he couldn't pick me up physically, he would pick me up"
7gWq1MU1iNU,520530,525500,"emotionally, he would pick me up spiritually."
7gWq1MU1iNU,526790,531519,I had a great dad because he would always pick me up.
7gWq1MU1iNU,531520,534990,He would always change my perspective.
7gWq1MU1iNU,542970,546300,So my daddy called me on the phone and he asked me a question he said son you
7gWq1MU1iNU,546300,552230,"had a tough year, what's next? I said dad I'm gonna be a hospital administrator."
7gWq1MU1iNU,552230,555930,"He said not bad but let me ask you a question, son do you believe you're an"
7gWq1MU1iNU,555930,563640,"NBA player? You cannot produce yourself in there son, if you don't think so, go take the"
7gWq1MU1iNU,563640,576929,"job. But if you believe you're an NBA player, go for it."
7gWq1MU1iNU,576930,580378,My dad had self-control and discipline and waited for my answer and
7gWq1MU1iNU,580379,588870,"my answer was yes, you're right Dad. I can't work the rest of my life. Playing in the NBA is a dream"
7gWq1MU1iNU,589130,592930,I've had ever since I was a little boy.
7gWq1MU1iNU,593430,597300,"He said, go for it son."
7gWq1MU1iNU,597300,601950,"I limped back into my coach's office with a cast on my foot,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,601950,610480,"tears in my eyes. I said Coach what do I need to do to play in the NBA? He said, do"
7gWq1MU1iNU,610480,613750,two things and you can play in the NBA. Lose 20 pounds and shoot a three-point shot
7gWq1MU1iNU,613750,617770,with range you can play in the NBA. If you lose 20 pounds and shoot the three-point shot with
7gWq1MU1iNU,617770,622150,range you can play in the NBA. I lost 20 pounds and every day I would shoot 500
7gWq1MU1iNU,622150,625780,"shots a day, every single day. I got invited to training camp with the"
7gWq1MU1iNU,625780,629940,"Dallas Mavericks and not only did I make the team, I became the first ever undrafted"
7gWq1MU1iNU,629940,634440,rookie free agent in the history of the Dallas Mavericks to start opening night!
7gWq1MU1iNU,634440,639220,Could you imagine what was going through my mind:
7gWq1MU1iNU,639220,645329,"I had not started a basket-ball game since high-school. I got to the arena, they dimmed the lights, and they put"
7gWq1MU1iNU,645330,652850,"the spotlight right on me.  Right in the spotlight I saw my mama right there, and all my brothers and sisters"
7gWq1MU1iNU,652900,655800,"and then I saw my dad,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,656300,659290,"and i pumped my fist,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,659380,672850,"and he pumped his fist, and tears streamed down my face. Thank you for all those timeouts,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,672850,677800,thank you for making sure I was always home when the streetlights came on.
7gWq1MU1iNU,678550,684730,Thank you for making sure I could always hear your voice. Thank you for always
7gWq1MU1iNU,684730,693310,changing my perspective. I got a simple simple simple question for you..Here is
7gWq1MU1iNU,693310,697600,the question - Do you believe that one day you are not going live in the world that
7gWq1MU1iNU,697600,702190,was given to you that's right but you are going to actually live in the world
7gWq1MU1iNU,702190,705000,that you dream of..
7gWq1MU1iNU,716080,721060,You gotta make every single second count.. You gotta go in the future and see it baby..
7gWq1MU1iNU,721060,723990,And than you gotta come come back in the present...
7gWq1MU1iNU,723990,728920,"And you gotta take that big goal, that big dream, that big reality, that;s what I said,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,728920,734320,You gotta take that big reality... And you gotta take small steps to make it
7gWq1MU1iNU,734320,737580,managable... To make it so your dreams become a reality..
7gWq1MU1iNU,739899,745880,"Think BIG, Dream BIG but start small.. That's right START SMALL - remember what I"
7gWq1MU1iNU,745880,749779,"told start where you are... with what you have, because what you have is plenty.."
7gWq1MU1iNU,749779,756470,But the biggest enemy you have to deal with is yourself... There is an old African
7gWq1MU1iNU,756470,761060,proverb that says:  If there's no enemy within.. the enemy outside can do us no harm...
7gWq1MU1iNU,761060,767930,You don't have to personally be perfect.. Do you hear me?
7gWq1MU1iNU,767930,771170,"There are those of you right now you should've cut a CD, you should've wrote"
7gWq1MU1iNU,771170,774200,"a book, you should have gotten in school and get that degree.. You should've"
7gWq1MU1iNU,774200,778010,started your own business.. There are so many things you should've done..
7gWq1MU1iNU,778010,782360,You should've done.. But you didn't do it because you are.. SCARED...
7gWq1MU1iNU,782360,786500,You say scared of what? - I ain't scared... You are scared... You are scared
7gWq1MU1iNU,786500,789709,"of failure, you are scared to make a mistake.. You are scared.... that you are not perfect..."
7gWq1MU1iNU,789709,793430,And I'm telling you today you ain't gotta be perfect. Are you hearing what I'm saying?
7gWq1MU1iNU,793430,798620,"You don't have to be perfect to get what you want.. to do what you want,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,798620,802850,"to have what you want, to be what you want...  You don't have to be perfect.... It's a LIE."
7gWq1MU1iNU,802850,809000,There will never be a point in your life... where it's the right time...
7gWq1MU1iNU,809000,813829,to do a great thing... If you are waiting for that perfect perfect
7gWq1MU1iNU,813829,818959,moment... That perfect timing... is not going to happen.. You know what you have to do?
7gWq1MU1iNU,818960,825910,You have to create the perfect time and the perfect opportunity and the perfect situation.
7gWq1MU1iNU,828000,836020,"So a lot of people become comfortable... They stop growing, They stop wanting"
7gWq1MU1iNU,836020,839730,anything.. They become satisfied....
7gWq1MU1iNU,839880,844930,"People getting ready to go to jobs that they don't like, jobs that are making them SICK"
7gWq1MU1iNU,844930,848980,You see when you are not pursuing your goal you are literally
7gWq1MU1iNU,848980,854079,committing spiritual suicide. When you have some goal out here that you are
7gWq1MU1iNU,854080,857440,reaching for that takes you out of your comfort zone.
7gWq1MU1iNU,857440,861400,You'll find out some talents and abilities you have... That you didn't know you had.
7gWq1MU1iNU,861400,866650,When the messenger of misery  visits you? What are you going to do?
7gWq1MU1iNU,866650,873520,What will keep you in the game. There are things that you think you'll never need to know
7gWq1MU1iNU,873520,877290,that you may only need to know one time
7gWq1MU1iNU,877290,880579,in your life but that could save your life because you had that knowledge.
7gWq1MU1iNU,880580,884070,Unless you attempt to do something beyond that which you have already
7gWq1MU1iNU,884070,888630,mastered you will NEVER GROW. What is it that you looked at some point in time
7gWq1MU1iNU,888630,893430,and you decided that you couldn't do it. That you talk yourself out of it.
7gWq1MU1iNU,893430,896459,You waiting for your next door neighbor.. to make it happen for you... It may not happen.
7gWq1MU1iNU,896459,900029,If you want on your mother or your father... They may be so ancient in their thinking.
7gWq1MU1iNU,900029,902790,that they don't understand this opportunity that you have
7gWq1MU1iNU,902790,906570,and if you wait on them that may never get done. You don't pay average
7gWq1MU1iNU,906570,909570,"people to be phenomenal, you don't pay good people to be phenomenal."
7gWq1MU1iNU,909570,916140,You just are phenomenal and you will attract phenomenal. What reason can you
7gWq1MU1iNU,916140,920580,"remember that you can call on, that you reach on, that could make you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,920580,925500,get back up? Find that reason. If you are not where
7gWq1MU1iNU,925500,929310,"you are, if you're not where you wanna be... If you don't have what you want to have"
7gWq1MU1iNU,929310,932940,"If you are not where you think you should be at this particular place, it has nothing to do"
7gWq1MU1iNU,932940,936300,"with the system, but it has everything to do with the fact that you're not making"
7gWq1MU1iNU,936300,941700,a sacrifice. I want you to make that dream become a reality. Because if you
7gWq1MU1iNU,941700,945779,don't you will be working for somebody else to make their dreams become a
7gWq1MU1iNU,945779,949500,reality. The Question is - What are you gonna do with your time?
7gWq1MU1iNU,949500,956540,What drives you? - Greatness is a lot of small things done well.
7gWq1MU1iNU,956540,967519,Day after day.. Workout after workout.. Day after day... When things don't
7gWq1MU1iNU,967520,972380,"work out for you, when things happen that you could not anticipate, what are the"
7gWq1MU1iNU,972380,977450,reasons that you can think of that can keep you strong.. You will never ever be
7gWq1MU1iNU,977450,983210,successful.. Until you turn your PAIN INTO GREATNESS. Until you ally your pain
7gWq1MU1iNU,983210,988250,"to push you from where you are, to push you to where you need to be. Stop running"
7gWq1MU1iNU,988250,994160,"from your pain, and embrace your pain. Your pain is going to be a part of your prize"
7gWq1MU1iNU,994160,999720,a part of your product. I challenge you to push yourself. See it's easy to be
7gWq1MU1iNU,999840,1003840,"on the bottom. It doesn't take any effort to be a loser, doesn't take any"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1003840,1009860,"motivation, any drive in order to stay down there on a low level. But it calls on everything in you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1009959,1016120,you have to harness your will to say I am going to challenge myself. What you did
7gWq1MU1iNU,1016120,1020680,"last week don't count. Today, Today is the only important day."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1020680,1025449,There are 86 400 seconds in a day... And how you use those ate critical.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1025449,1030459,You got 86 400 a day.. And what you do today is going to seep into who
7gWq1MU1iNU,1030459,1036400,you are. Nobody's gonna talk about what you did last week.  You have this opportunity
7gWq1MU1iNU,1036400,1041709,of a lifetime. It means absolutely nothing if you don't take advantage of it in the
7gWq1MU1iNU,1041709,1044980,lifetime of this opportunity. I got a saying that when life knocks you down
7gWq1MU1iNU,1044980,1049210,"try and land on your back because if you can look up, you can get up and if you want"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1049210,1053350,"a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it, to work day and night for it,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1053350,1058360,"to give up your time, your peace and your sleep for it, if all that you dream and scheme"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1058360,1063490,is about it and life seems useless and worthless without it see it's time now
7gWq1MU1iNU,1063490,1067330,"if you wanna make this your decade, you gotta start saying yes to your"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1067330,1072390,life. You gotta start saying yes to your dreams. Yes to your unfolding future.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1072390,1077850,Yes to your potential as opposed to saying no.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1077850,1082919,"When you die, die or leave, leave no dream left behind guys, leave no opportunity"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1082920,1089120,"left behind when you leave this earth, accomplish every single thing you can accomplish."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1089120,1093720,Listen to me. You're gonna be here one day but you'll never get here if you give
7gWq1MU1iNU,1093720,1098970,"up, if you give in, if you quit and finally guys you gotta want to succeed"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1098970,1103669,as bad as you wanna breathe.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1117360,1122020,What people think about you and the possibilities for your dream is none of
7gWq1MU1iNU,1122020,1127260,your business. The attitude is it can't be done because they haven't seen it
7gWq1MU1iNU,1127260,1134370,history is being read but it's also being written by people with imagination.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1137340,1142270,"It's necessary you take responsibility for it. That you make it happen, that you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1142270,1145960,"don't give up, that you don't take any objection or disappointment or defeats"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1145960,1150220,"personally, that you keep on keeping on, that you don't decide that I can't make"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1150220,1153340,"it because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, that you realize"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1153340,1159970,that's a part of the program. As the physically weak man can make himself
7gWq1MU1iNU,1159970,1164320,"strong by careful and patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1164320,1168450,them strong by exercising himself in right thinking.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1168450,1172830,To put away aimlessness and weakness and to begin to think with purpose is to
7gWq1MU1iNU,1172830,1176909,enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the
7gWq1MU1iNU,1176910,1181650,pathways to attainment. Who make all conditions serve them and who think
7gWq1MU1iNU,1181650,1187400,"strongly, attempt fearlessly and accomplish masterfully."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1191630,1196350,"He who would accomplish little, must sacrifice little. He who would achieve"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1196350,1211570,"much, must sacrifice much, he who would attain highly, must sacrifice greatly."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1211570,1217090,What are you gonna do starting tomorrow that'll make a difference? Major step to
7gWq1MU1iNU,1217090,1222230,human progress - discipline. If there's one thing to get excited over
7gWq1MU1iNU,1222230,1227220,that's it. Get excited over your ability to make yourself do the
7gWq1MU1iNU,1227220,1230480,necessary things.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1234900,1237860,"Because the story you have about your life, or about your business,"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1238980,1242268,"about the area of life, is not where you want to be."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1242730,1245510,Your story is what's making this stuff.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1247500,1252300,"Yes, it's hard, it's hard, and we will do it hard and once if we do it hard, and we got through it, and"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1252300,1259280,"we realize it was worth it and once you discover it was worth it, it is done."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1259800,1266210,"Study the things that can change your economic, social, spiritual, personal life"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1267640,1270730,so you don't want to wind up at the end of your life and discover that you've
7gWq1MU1iNU,1270730,1273900,lived only 1/10 of it.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1294000,1299560,Maybe you're at the darkest point of your life and you're ready to give up. You're at a point
7gWq1MU1iNU,1299560,1306460,in your life when you feel like it's do or die. You're going through so much pain
7gWq1MU1iNU,1306460,1310570,"you're going through so much agony, you're ready to give up, you're ready to quit."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1310570,1326179,I've got one word for you - warrior! Woo! Warrior! Fear. It's not real.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1326179,1333110,The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1333110,1339260,It is a product of our imagination causing us to fear things that do not at
7gWq1MU1iNU,1339260,1343720,present and may not ever exist.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1344760,1350470,Fear is a choice.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1350470,1359380,Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1359440,1363789,I want your dream to be so clear that when you wake up in the morning all you got
7gWq1MU1iNU,1363789,1371710,to do is step in your dream and the first step for me was seeing something I
7gWq1MU1iNU,1371710,1377970,was not before I was. You can do it. Where you are is temporary!
7gWq1MU1iNU,1377970,1381919,You will not be there for the rest of your life.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1382900,1386410,"I don't care what happens in your life, I don't care what it looks like, I don't"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1386410,1390430,"care where you are, every single day you wake up if you're going to have energy"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1390430,1394570,"if you're going to have passion, if you're going to have drive, every day you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1394570,1398889,"wake up you've got to start with that vision. This is a mentality like, you got"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1398890,1404410,"to live this, you got to eat this, you got - every single thing you do is not a choosing"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1404410,1411210,"it's a way of life. It's got to possess everything you do, it's got to own."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1412930,1418470,There's no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1419760,1424320,"I want to see how far I can go, I want to see what I can acomplish, I want to see"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1424320,1428429,"what I can do, what I can be, what I can have, I want to see I don't want to see"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1428430,1432060,"what I think I can do, I don't want to see what think is possible, I want to"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1432060,1435630,see what my life will looks life if I don't count the cost and I was willing to go
7gWq1MU1iNU,1435630,1446600,further then anybody was willing to do. You can't do anything without faith it's
7gWq1MU1iNU,1446600,1451890,"impossible to accomplish anything without faith, so i need you to believe."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1451890,1456810,"There is still time, as long there is a breath in your nostrils, as long as you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1456810,1464370,can wake up in the morning The first step before anyone else in the world
7gWq1MU1iNU,1464370,1469500,"believes it, you have to believe it So I need you to believe Cause if you're"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1469500,1472140,willing to go through all the battling you got to go through to get where you
7gWq1MU1iNU,1472140,1476010,"want to get, who's got the right to stop you?  I mean maybe some of you guys got"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1476010,1478470,"something you never finished, something you really want to do, something you never said to"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1478470,1482640,"someone, something... and you're told no, even after you paid your dues? Who's got the"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1482640,1486500,"right to tell you that, who? Nobody! It's your right to listen to your gut, it ain't"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1486500,1490310,nobody's right to say no after you earned the right to be where you want to be
7gWq1MU1iNU,1490310,1492520,and do what you want to do!
7gWq1MU1iNU,1493340,1497179,"you gotta do, what you was called to do you gotta do, what you was born to do"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1497179,1505590,"you gotta do, what works for you, because if you do what works for you gonna blow up."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1505590,1510570,It's in your DNA! It's who you are!
7gWq1MU1iNU,1514990,1523290,You are a warrior. It's time for you not to back up. Not to give up. Not to give in.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1523440,1527559,"Either you get knocked down and you get back up you get back up, you get back up and you continue"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1527560,1533800,to throw shit against the wall. Listen to me very carefully you are a warrior.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1533800,1543160,It is time for you to fight.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1543160,1551040,I know you have that warrior inside and now I just need you to activate it.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1551560,1559240,"Keep going, as dark as it gets keep going."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1559240,1563770,"As difficult as it gets, as much as it seems as if the world is"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1563770,1571000,"crumbling down around you and there's no way out, keep going."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1571000,1577390,"See most people stop, they don't get it, they quit, they quit reaching for their dreams."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1577390,1582070,"I noticed that there are those who are squashers of dreams. Now, I don't know why these people do this."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1582070,1586450,I don't know why the naysayers or squashers do this. Grow stronger and then inspire
7gWq1MU1iNU,1586450,1592690,others to become the strongest version of themselves that's how we evolve.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1592690,1598779,I go beyond the fears and limitations of other people. I control my life.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1598780,1603910,No matter what road you take in life there are always going to be things
7gWq1MU1iNU,1603910,1608270,"you have to do that you just don't want to don't do. Go and do the thing. Look, you"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1608270,1613580,only get this life once. Every experience that we have leads us to who we are and where we stand
7gWq1MU1iNU,1613580,1620840,"and that's always the right place to be. If you can't, you must. If there's something that"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1620840,1624799,you can't do because there's an obstacle in your way
7gWq1MU1iNU,1624799,1629240,that means it's your responsibility to do that thing so that you can destroy
7gWq1MU1iNU,1629240,1631720,the obstacle.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1632680,1637170,Failure is necessary.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1637170,1644400,Failure is success and success is failure. They need each other. The more failings you
7gWq1MU1iNU,1644400,1649980,"have, the more success you have, the  darker the night, the brighter the day."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1649980,1656030,"The harder the ball hits the ground, the higher it goes up."
7gWq1MU1iNU,1682780,1687830,Pain is a beautiful thing. Challenge is what life is about. A life without
7gWq1MU1iNU,1687830,1694880,"challenge, a life without pain, is a life without growth. So not only do I embrace"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1694880,1698929,"the challenge, embrace the pain but I even look forward to it. Send me a"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1698929,1704000,"challenge, please give me some challenges here because I need to be tested, I need to"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1704000,1708590,"be stronger, I need to grow. You know they say there's a Judgment Day. I believe we"
7gWq1MU1iNU,1708590,1713390,face multiple judgment days while we're walking on earth. The judgement today is
7gWq1MU1iNU,1713390,1718669,today. Judgment Day is now and the judgment is
7gWq1MU1iNU,1718669,1733009,going to allow you to live a life of hell now or to choose your own Kingdom.
7gWq1MU1iNU,1733010,1737230,Listen to me very carefully you are a warrior.
