Z1qYecnkrBk,50399,57280,the hollywood savior was an expected and  natural progression of the atypical  hollywood hero john mclean is a far cry
Z1qYecnkrBk,57280,62960,from john keating on the surface but  when the common consensus on  storytelling is that every story needs a
Z1qYecnkrBk,62960,69360,hero it's only natural that a story  about teachers and the education system  would find one character to pen heroic
Z1qYecnkrBk,69360,74479,ambition and sainthood on and it works  because generally people love movies
Z1qYecnkrBk,74479,80880,that make them feel good movies that  make them want to follow their dreams or  be a positive influence i fully intend
Z1qYecnkrBk,80880,87520,on poking holes in and poking fun at  some of the more questionable takes in  the teacher savior subgenre so beloved
Z1qYecnkrBk,87520,94960,by many but i'd like to make it known  that i typically enjoy the hell out of a  feel-good teacher movie school of rock
Z1qYecnkrBk,94960,101840,link later's best film i don't care what  anyone says like  little pepino still makes me cry
Z1qYecnkrBk,103040,109119,and i'm even worse with the feel good  sports movie for a person who does not  watch and knows very little about sports
Z1qYecnkrBk,109119,114479,put a paint by numbers inspirational  sports movie in front of me and you've  given me a comfort movie for life i've
Z1qYecnkrBk,114479,121680,seen coach carter enough times to have  not only the dialogue memorized but  every single needle drop to a t and i
Z1qYecnkrBk,121680,127439,still get emotional when teemo wants to  rejoin the basketball team but he owes  coach all these push-ups and suicides
Z1qYecnkrBk,127439,133200,and he doesn't do enough in time to be  part of the team again and like i'll do  push-ups for him i'll do something
Z1qYecnkrBk,133200,139360,i'll run suicides too i do some too one  person struggles with struggle one  player
Z1qYecnkrBk,139360,144480,right  i love it so i won't act as if i don't  get the appeal of these movies or like i
Z1qYecnkrBk,144480,150000,don't have the faintest idea as to why  hollywood loves this trope so truly  madly deeply what i do intend to
Z1qYecnkrBk,150000,156720,question is the framing devices used in  these movies the educators it chooses to  highlight its racial implications the
Z1qYecnkrBk,156720,161920,failure of nuance when these stories  many of which are based on reality are  put through the black and white filter
Z1qYecnkrBk,161920,167760,of play it safe hollywood and the real  life impact these films have on the  already failing american education
Z1qYecnkrBk,167760,172959,system  this is my classroom  you don't like it the doors to my left
Z1qYecnkrBk,172959,178319,lady why you be tripping like that  no jamal
Z1qYecnkrBk,178319,183920,you be trippin  so where exactly did the save our  students trope begin if we look back far
Z1qYecnkrBk,183920,189760,enough it seems like a tale as old as  time even prior to blackboard jungle the  film often credited with kickstarting
Z1qYecnkrBk,189760,194400,the subgenre  that's pronounced
Z1qYecnkrBk,196640,201680,there was bright road bright road was a  1953 film based on school teacher mary
Z1qYecnkrBk,201680,208080,elizabeth roman's short story a piece of  fiction loosely based on her experiences  with teaching and published in a june
Z1qYecnkrBk,208080,214319,1951 edition of ladies home journal the  film adaptation starred legendary  players dorothy dandridge and harry

Z1qYecnkrBk,225519,231440,what are we talking about chemistry  we're talking about chemistry man jane  richards is a young novice school
Z1qYecnkrBk,231440,237360,teacher nervous about her first year of  teaching she has some difficulty with  troubled student ct but slowly gets
Z1qYecnkrBk,237360,242720,through to him by being empathetic and  patient the movie is also about her  burgeoning romance with the principal mr
Z1qYecnkrBk,242720,249840,williams bright road along with being  one of the first in this subgenre is  also only one of the very few or maybe
Z1qYecnkrBk,249840,257199,like two films that exist about black  women being teachers and being a  positive influence on their students but
Z1qYecnkrBk,257199,263680,you know what to do with your pen by now  it wasn't until blackboard jungle in  1955 and later up the down staircase
Z1qYecnkrBk,263680,270000,that the scenario began to shift with  the real world beginning to have more  desegregation we got stories about white
Z1qYecnkrBk,270000,275680,school teachers having to teach black  and brown kids and not knowing how to  control them which in itself is already
Z1qYecnkrBk,275680,281919,a bit  it's here in history that you can see  the wheels of the hollywood mind
Z1qYecnkrBk,281919,289040,beginning to turn the appeal it seems in  making these movies isn't just to churn  out inspirational water it's to utilize
Z1qYecnkrBk,289040,295360,the fish out of water trope by putting a  narrow and specific focus on white  teachers being thrown into this mostly
Z1qYecnkrBk,295360,302639,black world the hook for audiences being  what is such a straight-laced person  doing in such a wild environment
Z1qYecnkrBk,302639,308400,literally the original trailer for up  the down staircase asks this of its  white protagonist entering a
Z1qYecnkrBk,308400,314320,multi-racial school zone hey just a  minute  what is a nice girl like you doing in a
Z1qYecnkrBk,314320,320720,crazy place like this  and that question partly answers why we  see so many of these stories and why
Z1qYecnkrBk,320720,326880,it's usually a white teacher being  thrust into a mostly black and brown  school these schools are on screen
Z1qYecnkrBk,326880,332720,treated like they're the dark  underworlds of chaos and fear hollywood  loves the savior trope because it's
Z1qYecnkrBk,332720,338080,partly a fish out of water trope and  they love using the fish out of water  trope alongside race in class because
Z1qYecnkrBk,338080,343440,the dichotomy is fascinating and makes  for good storytelling but rarely do  these films observe that dichotomy in a
Z1qYecnkrBk,343440,349440,way that captures all the gray areas and  all the nuances of what it means to be  positioned above a group of people and
Z1qYecnkrBk,349440,356240,not only authority but in class and  society in these movies a white teacher  enters an unruly school full of students
Z1qYecnkrBk,356240,363039,who are not only badly behaved but who  can barely read or write or have a poor  understanding of basic arithmetic rarely
Z1qYecnkrBk,363039,369280,do these stories consider the situations  that have put these students into such a  state the correlation between illiteracy
Z1qYecnkrBk,369280,374400,and poverty or the low state funding  that can result in schools having  outdated textbooks understaffed
Z1qYecnkrBk,374400,380080,buildings and underpaid teachers they  have no problem depicting these students  not wanting to go to school or even
Z1qYecnkrBk,380080,387120,skipping school altogether but rarely do  they go into the why because often times  and especially in communities with low
Z1qYecnkrBk,387120,392960,school funding students don't want to go  to school because they can see from the  dilapidated buildings and the old
Z1qYecnkrBk,392960,399600,textbooks and the uninspired teachers  that no one really cares if they get an  education or not so why bother these
Z1qYecnkrBk,399600,406000,movies scarcely look at all the ways in  which the education system as a whole is  pretty flawed and it rarely acknowledges
Z1qYecnkrBk,406000,413919,the work of any teacher outside of the  main character two great and infamous  examples are dangerous minds and freedom
Z1qYecnkrBk,413919,420160,writers in dangerous minds the fictional  counterpart of luanne johnson is framed  as being the only teacher who cares
Z1qYecnkrBk,420160,426240,about her students and wants them to  succeed the school is marred and  graffiti and litter the students are so
Z1qYecnkrBk,426240,432400,badly behaved that luanne has to resort  to karate lessons to get them to be  quiet for five [ __ ] seconds and the
Z1qYecnkrBk,432400,439120,entire faculty has essentially given up  on these kids but the movie adaptation  is so vastly different from reality that
Z1qYecnkrBk,439120,445440,even knowing hollywood is behind it it  gets a little laughable teachers who  worked at karl mont high the school
Z1qYecnkrBk,445440,450960,depicted in the movie have made it a  point over the years to clarify that the  school they taught at was not the school
Z1qYecnkrBk,450960,458000,depicted in the final cut it should also  be noted that dangerous minds was based  on the cringely titled memoir my posse
Z1qYecnkrBk,458000,463680,don't do homework but i don't blame  johnson for the film adaptation because  as she learned after seeing the movie
Z1qYecnkrBk,463680,469680,post-release in 1995 hollywood lies are  akin to wildfires once they get started
Z1qYecnkrBk,469680,476479,it ravishes everything in sight until  you can't recognize what was there  before and even she took issue with some
Z1qYecnkrBk,476479,482160,of the liberties taken by the filmmakers  for instance the producers were really  pushing to include a subplot where
Z1qYecnkrBk,482160,488400,johnson was suspended from the school  for having a relationship with her  student bewildered johnson of course
Z1qYecnkrBk,488400,493440,told them that they couldn't do that  they insisted that it would add a bit of  sexiness to the story even more
Z1qYecnkrBk,493440,498879,bewildered johnson was like bro i'm a  teacher you can't say i did something  like that because people will think that
Z1qYecnkrBk,498879,504960,i did it i could lose my job that is  illegal and they were like oh fine party  pooper just want a [ __ ] student how
Z1qYecnkrBk,504960,510479,disappointing but the liberties didn't  stop there wade dominguez's character is  murdered toward the end of the movie
Z1qYecnkrBk,510479,516080,despite the fact that no student of  johnson's during her time at carlemont  high school was killed and she never
Z1qYecnkrBk,516080,521760,faced so much animosity from her  students and their families for being  white in the movie the grandmother of
Z1qYecnkrBk,521760,527200,two of her students pulls her grandson  out of school and when johnson goes to  see what's going on the grandmother says
Z1qYecnkrBk,527200,532399,this hi  i'm luanne johnson i'm the boys teacher  i know who you are
Z1qYecnkrBk,532399,537920,you're that white red [ __ ] messing with  my baby's mind to that johnson was quick
Z1qYecnkrBk,537920,544399,to dispute it was really insulting most  of these black grandmothers are  church-going women and it taps into a
Z1qYecnkrBk,544399,550640,misconception that black parents are  going to be antagonistic toward white  people which wasn't my experience many
Z1qYecnkrBk,550640,556720,of these teacher savior movies aren't  about critiquing the education system in  fact i'd say most of them aren't
Z1qYecnkrBk,556720,563040,remotely concerned about critiquing the  education system but what they all have  in common is an overvaluing of trauma
Z1qYecnkrBk,563040,569120,porn and poverty porn teachers employed  at carlemont high school were clear to  say that the school wasn't nearly as bad
Z1qYecnkrBk,569120,575120,as it was shown to be in dangerous minds  no student of johnson's was murdered  just off campus despite her best efforts
Z1qYecnkrBk,575120,581360,to protect him in fact the real life  person dominus's character was based on  went on to join the marine corps and in
Z1qYecnkrBk,581360,588480,the case of freedom writers the 2007  film based on the 1999 book it's really  not that much different critics of the
Z1qYecnkrBk,588480,593839,film adaptation have pointed out how  different the long beach school looked  on screen than how it actually looked in
Z1qYecnkrBk,593839,600640,1993 to 1998 the time period in which  the story takes place they've also  pointed out that aaron cruel the teacher
Z1qYecnkrBk,600640,605839,at the center of the story also taught  middle-class white students and that  many teachers at the school assisted her
Z1qYecnkrBk,605839,611519,in achieving her goals with her class  judging from the film you'd think that  no teacher had ever tried this worse
Z1qYecnkrBk,611519,618079,you'd guess that apart from the noble  gruel no other teacher cares gruelle's  work is noteworthy but it is by no means
Z1qYecnkrBk,618079,624000,unusual racism is another thing these  movies want to focus on but in the same  way that these movies do all the time
Z1qYecnkrBk,624000,629680,which is to put racism off as being  something that only the worst of  individuals do and that has nothing to
Z1qYecnkrBk,629680,635480,do with a system of disadvantage and  freedom writers gruel is confronted by a  fellow teacher who is almost
Z1qYecnkrBk,635480,641680,cartoonishly racist this character is  the worst of the worst but that's as far  as the film goes in its portrayal of
Z1qYecnkrBk,641680,647519,implicit bias and discrimination in the  school environment these films usually  have a fixation on highlighting race
Z1qYecnkrBk,647519,653600,specifically the animosity black  students feel for their nice white lady  teachers and the odd cartoonish racist
Z1qYecnkrBk,653600,659760,but they all lack the self-awareness it  seems to realize they're leaning a  little heavily into a white savior
Z1qYecnkrBk,659760,665839,narrative during the filming of  dangerous minds actress brooklyn harris  asked luanne johnson why it was that
Z1qYecnkrBk,665839,673040,stories like these always centered on  white people uplifting the quote poor  little negroes and johnson simply said i
Z1qYecnkrBk,673040,678640,wrote the book i have to be white but  harris's question was valid i don't  think she was asking luanne johnson why
Z1qYecnkrBk,678640,684640,she wrote a story about a white teacher  uplifting black students i'm pretty sure  she knew it was a memoir having seen a
Z1qYecnkrBk,684640,690640,lot of these movies come and go i can't  help but notice that there's always a  consistency in what movies are selected
Z1qYecnkrBk,690640,696480,to be adapted into films and that there  are a disproportionate amount of  adaptations based on the writings of
Z1qYecnkrBk,696480,702079,white teachers and inner city schools  there are teachers of color who not only  teach in these communities but live in
Z1qYecnkrBk,702079,707519,these communities who make a difference  for their students every day but those  aren't the stories that get told you
Z1qYecnkrBk,707519,712800,would think based on the makeup of these  movies that there were very few black  educators who made a difference in their
Z1qYecnkrBk,712800,718560,classrooms and that there weren't any  who wrote books about those experiences  but one of the teachers who live in
Z1qYecnkrBk,718560,725360,those neighborhoods and teach at those  schools what of the stories of the  teachers who have always been there
Z1qYecnkrBk,725360,730480,in case you haven't noticed mrs collins  we are in a ghetto these children don't  want to learn
Z1qYecnkrBk,730480,738279,the ghetto  is not the enemy miss denny i suppose  you mean we are indifferences
Z1qYecnkrBk,743200,750480,i feel sometimes like a person to whom  and childhood was entrusted some sacred  flame this is the desire to see my race
Z1qYecnkrBk,750480,757200,lifted out of the mire of ignorance  weakness and degradation no longer to  sit in obscure corners and devour the
Z1qYecnkrBk,757200,764079,scraps of knowledge which his superiors  flung at him i want to see him crowned  with strength and dignity adorned with
Z1qYecnkrBk,764079,770000,the enduring grace of intellectual  attainments on may 17 1954 after years
Z1qYecnkrBk,770000,775360,of the civil rights movement and efforts  of black school teachers across the  country the supreme court ruled for
Z1qYecnkrBk,775360,781920,desegregating all schools citing  segregation as unconstitutional black  kids were bused to schools that were now
Z1qYecnkrBk,781920,788079,integrated facing a lot of animosity and  violence from white parents and students  who did not want them there the little
Z1qYecnkrBk,788079,794560,rock 9 was not that long ago the kids  show up to school on september 4th 1957
Z1qYecnkrBk,794560,802160,the first day of school the senior in  the group of the little rock nine is  ernest green and he is like oh my gosh
Z1qYecnkrBk,802160,808800,there is an ass load of angry white  people black schools and institutions  were slowly but surely shuttered and
Z1qYecnkrBk,808800,814240,countless black teachers and principals  were either demoted to driving buses  becoming lunch ladies and school
Z1qYecnkrBk,814240,822160,janitors or they were fired and had to  find after years of being an educator  another form of work today people lament
Z1qYecnkrBk,822160,828320,the scarcity of black teachers in the  education system but few acknowledge the  ways in which black educators were shut
Z1qYecnkrBk,828320,835360,out of education almost as soon as  segregation ended black students already  had a difficult time being accepted into
Z1qYecnkrBk,835360,841600,white schools black teachers going into  white schools and teaching white kids  also didn't sit well with white teachers
Z1qYecnkrBk,841600,847360,or white parents even after the negative  effects of integration with black  students being placed in often hostile
Z1qYecnkrBk,847360,853600,environments and black teachers being  fired black teachers still try to  advocate for the changes they initially
Z1qYecnkrBk,853600,860560,envisioned when pushing for integration  but under the positive white noise of  brown versus board of education no one
Z1qYecnkrBk,860560,866000,would hear them out the way dangerous  minds and freedom writers and the  plethora of other films focused on the
Z1qYecnkrBk,866000,871519,white savior teacher narrative are so  fixated on race you'd think more  opportunities would be taken to
Z1qYecnkrBk,871519,877120,highlight the stories of the few black  teachers that were integrated into white  schools or the resistance black students
Z1qYecnkrBk,877120,883680,faced from white teachers just after  integration but when these stories from  black teachers were told they were also
Z1qYecnkrBk,883680,890820,swiftly dismissed and here is where we  have got to talk about  beryl gilroy
Z1qYecnkrBk,890820,906880,[Music]
Z1qYecnkrBk,906880,914560,beryl gilroy the first blackhead teacher  in britain after teaching in guyana from  the late 40s up until the 50s she moved
Z1qYecnkrBk,914560,920320,to london and looked for work as a  teacher there at the time though there  was so much hostility towards black
Z1qYecnkrBk,920320,927360,folks that she struggled to get a job  and when she did eventually get one in  the late 60s she faced a riot of racist
Z1qYecnkrBk,927360,933440,abuse from not only fellow teachers and  parents but from her very own students
Z1qYecnkrBk,933440,940160,when i came out so you eyed me with a  look of puree and curiosity  not being rude she said just being
Z1qYecnkrBk,940160,945920,inquisitive what do natives do when they  go to bed i asked
Z1qYecnkrBk,945920,952000,you know  she said self-consciously gesturing  your monthlies
Z1qYecnkrBk,952000,959279,you mean when we menstruate i asked she  nodded  well sue i replied with mock seriousness
Z1qYecnkrBk,959279,964800,we swim  we jump into the nearest river and swim  and swim for miles some of us swim for
Z1qYecnkrBk,964800,970079,three days and some for four but that's  what we do in 1976 gilroy published a
Z1qYecnkrBk,970079,976639,book aptly titled black teacher which  detailed her experience being a fish out  of water teaching in a mostly white
Z1qYecnkrBk,976639,982240,school where the students often  discounted her because of her race and  you know how the public responded do you
Z1qYecnkrBk,982240,988000,want to guess do you think they made a  film adaptation of her work do you think  that like up the down staircase it
Z1qYecnkrBk,988000,995360,became a best seller well spoiler alert  honey a lot of people were really mad  many critics put the book down as being
Z1qYecnkrBk,995360,1000480,unrealistic they insisted that gilroy's  experience of racism in london schools
Z1qYecnkrBk,1000480,1007040,wasn't actually racism at all that she  was even making some of it up some went  as far as to say it wasn't that hard for
Z1qYecnkrBk,1007040,1012399,her to get a job as a teacher and that  whatever racism she thought she  experienced couldn't have been that bad
Z1qYecnkrBk,1012399,1018720,because she got to be a teacher anyway  and beryl gilroy's telling of  experiencing racism of being put in this
Z1qYecnkrBk,1018720,1024880,new world where so much hatred was  hurled at her critics questioned whether  they needed to hear about it again i get
Z1qYecnkrBk,1024880,1031038,it i get it they seem to say racism was  bad and immigrants are treated awfully  but we're fine now so do i really need
Z1qYecnkrBk,1031038,1036480,to hear about it again get over it  whereas with teachers like luanne  johnson the filmmakers adapting her
Z1qYecnkrBk,1036480,1042640,story were obsessed with centralizing  her experience being deplored by  students and parents for her race even
Z1qYecnkrBk,1042640,1049600,though those were not her experiences in  one scene johnson is branded a white  bred [ __ ] by an enraged grandparent of
Z1qYecnkrBk,1049600,1056080,african-american twins who have dropped  out of class jonathan tells me that this  never happened i asked them where did
Z1qYecnkrBk,1056080,1062320,that come from they said we were sure  that some of the black and the hispanic  parents must have resented you i said
Z1qYecnkrBk,1062320,1067600,for what for helping their kids hell  nobody ever ever said anything to me
Z1qYecnkrBk,1067600,1073840,like that if these stories are really  about highlighting the work of teachers  or highlighting racism stories like
Z1qYecnkrBk,1073840,1080240,gilroy's wouldn't be so easily dismissed  while stories like up the down staircase  by belle kaufman would become acclaimed
Z1qYecnkrBk,1080240,1086799,bestsellers and spawn film adaptations  and it's not quite just a case of  wanting white stories over black stories
Z1qYecnkrBk,1086799,1092799,because we get quite a few stories about  black male teachers and coaches saving  their students many of which are also
Z1qYecnkrBk,1092799,1099039,based on true stories the george mckenna  story remember the titans which is very  interesting about race the great debate
Z1qYecnkrBk,1099039,1104559,get out of here denzel god coach carter  pride and the father of all to sir with
Z1qYecnkrBk,1104559,1109840,love it's also important to make the  distinction that although to sir with  love was the story of a black teacher
Z1qYecnkrBk,1109840,1115280,teaching in a multiracial but mostly  white british school and not being able  to control the children he didn't really
Z1qYecnkrBk,1115280,1121039,centralize his experiences with racial  discrimination in such a way that white  readers became uncomfortable which
Z1qYecnkrBk,1121039,1126400,probably explains why beryl gilroy  writing not just about teaching and  becoming headmaster but about the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1126400,1131600,resistance she faced to get to that  point was met with backlash at the time  people were much more comfortable not
Z1qYecnkrBk,1131600,1137600,being reminded about the existence of  the racism she had to live through every  day cinema has always been more
Z1qYecnkrBk,1137600,1143600,comfortable with having black male leads  than with having black female leads so  movies about white male educators or
Z1qYecnkrBk,1143600,1149919,white female educators or black male  educators have often taken precedence  over movies about black female educators
Z1qYecnkrBk,1149919,1156480,which are so rare that despite so many  black women in education there are only  two movies based on their stories in
Z1qYecnkrBk,1156480,1163520,1981 the marva collins movie was  produced for tv starring the great  sicily tyson this made for tv movie is a
Z1qYecnkrBk,1163520,1170160,great deal better than i think a lot of  people would expect but of course  it is cicely tyson so
Z1qYecnkrBk,1170160,1176320,i mean marvin collins was a  chicago-based educator who started her  own private school called west side prep
Z1qYecnkrBk,1176320,1182320,elementary after feeling disappointed by  the education system and noting how it  seemed to be failing a lot of students
Z1qYecnkrBk,1182320,1187679,she was disillusioned by the faculty of  the public school she had been teaching  at and took five thousand dollars to buy
Z1qYecnkrBk,1187679,1193760,a space in west garfield park her own  neighborhood to give students the  education she thought they deserved she
Z1qYecnkrBk,1193760,1199360,taught the children the expected  essentials but also went as far as to  teach the socratic method shakespeare
Z1qYecnkrBk,1199360,1204400,and other classic literature before  making this decision she worked as a  substitute teacher throughout inner
Z1qYecnkrBk,1204400,1210320,cities in chicago which she did for over  14 years here was a teacher who saw how  schools were failing students
Z1qYecnkrBk,1210320,1216720,particularly low-income students and not  only adjusted her method of teaching but  decided to open a private school on her
Z1qYecnkrBk,1216720,1222400,own dime westside prep elementary took  tuition but for the students who  couldn't afford it school was often free
Z1qYecnkrBk,1222400,1228799,it was important to collins that the  black children being abandoned by the  education system would find their  footing and not be dismissed or
Z1qYecnkrBk,1228799,1235220,mislabeled before they had a chance to  learn i will be superior in my ability
Z1qYecnkrBk,1235220,1240799,[Applause]  in my thoughts  in my deeds
Z1qYecnkrBk,1240799,1246159,and in my actions  and you must be  so
Z1qYecnkrBk,1246159,1251919,who is the most important child in this  world  i am and what is the most important time
Z1qYecnkrBk,1251919,1258000,no now  and i don't want you to waste either one  of them  the movie brought marva collins a lot
Z1qYecnkrBk,1258000,1264880,more recognition and with admirers came  hordes of detractors her most famous  anti-fan was george and schmidt who
Z1qYecnkrBk,1264880,1270480,insisted time and time again that  collins was lying and that her students  couldn't possibly be capable of what she
Z1qYecnkrBk,1270480,1277200,said they were capable of that these  students were unteachable and any  progress collins claimed to have made  with them was entirely fabricated but
Z1qYecnkrBk,1277200,1284159,these stories the bright roads and the  marvin collins's movies aren't the norm  the two movies were released nearly 30
Z1qYecnkrBk,1284159,1289360,years apart from each other and now it's  been over 40 years since the marva  collins movie and stories about black
Z1qYecnkrBk,1289360,1295200,women in education are still pretty rare  the stories that are so often selected  to be highlighted are about the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1295200,1300960,experiences of white teachers with the  suggestion being that good teaching is  only exceptional when it's white
Z1qYecnkrBk,1300960,1306640,teachers undertaking the task and even  then only when their teaching is  directed towards students of color
Z1qYecnkrBk,1306640,1313200,because they're so damn unteachable  these damn kids  damn so when we go back and look at the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1313200,1319520,question of race in these movies and how  it's presented it becomes clear that the  movies in their aim to dismantle racism
Z1qYecnkrBk,1319520,1326159,isn't that at all it's instead a  depiction of nice white people with the  intent of upholding the idea of a
Z1qYecnkrBk,1326159,1332240,post-racial society many of these movies  are often more concerned with showing  the experiences of white teachers having
Z1qYecnkrBk,1332240,1338000,them experience a bit of pushback for  being white and giving them a taste of  racism by having them talk to a racist
Z1qYecnkrBk,1338000,1343200,individual who is one bad apple when  they take shape these films suggest a
Z1qYecnkrBk,1343200,1348960,civic duty for white people it is their  duty to help the ignorant black folks in
Z1qYecnkrBk,1348960,1355440,their lives it is their duty to save  them from themselves it is
Z1qYecnkrBk,1355760,1362559,their burden  i have some wonderful news for you

Z1qYecnkrBk,1402000,1407440,in 1898 the spanish-american war came to  an end when the u.s and spain signed the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1407440,1413840,treaty of paris the treaty put an end to  the war with spain's seeding sovereignty  of cuba puerto rico guam and the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1413840,1420159,philippines to the united states since  magellan discovered the philippines  claim of the country was staked by the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1420159,1426720,spanish empire the occupation lasting  for over 300 years during the  spanish-american war an agreement
Z1qYecnkrBk,1426720,1433039,basically a purchase made between spain  and the us led to the spanish occupation  slowly ending while the american
Z1qYecnkrBk,1433039,1439440,occupation was just beginning but it  wasn't going to be that simple after a  few centuries of occupation the filipino
Z1qYecnkrBk,1439440,1446720,people wanted independence and a month  after the treaty of paris revolutionary  emilio aguinaldo established the first
Z1qYecnkrBk,1446720,1452880,philippine republic in mao los bulacan  this conflict incited the  philippine-american war an event of mass
Z1qYecnkrBk,1452880,1459279,brutality and atrocities you had one  side fighting for the freedom they'd  been barred from for over 300 years and
Z1qYecnkrBk,1459279,1465120,the other side fighting against that  freedom for freedom and insisting that  they were indeed only fighting for the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1465120,1471520,freedom of the other side this  justification the idea that the u.s  government and its army were only doing
Z1qYecnkrBk,1471520,1478000,what was best for the savage filipinos  is what gave us benevolent assimilation  the policy that insisted that the goal
Z1qYecnkrBk,1478000,1484080,of the war was not to decimate the  filipinos but to save them from  something that they didn't really need
Z1qYecnkrBk,1484080,1490960,saving from emilio aguinaldo during the  spanish-american war actually led the  filipino army to recapturing many parts
Z1qYecnkrBk,1490960,1498640,of the philippines so i kind of think  like they were fine the goal of this  assimilation was to save filipino people
Z1qYecnkrBk,1498640,1504960,from their uncivil ways and this was  done through the atrocities of war and  also through education during the u.s
Z1qYecnkrBk,1504960,1511840,occupation the thomasites had the duty  of teaching the filipino youth civility  the duty of instructing them to embrace
Z1qYecnkrBk,1511840,1518400,instead the american way the guerrilla  war that ensued and the understandable  resistance of the philippines was what
Z1qYecnkrBk,1518400,1526400,inspired the one and only rudyard  kipling to make what is without a doubt  his most famous piece of writing

Z1qYecnkrBk,1666159,1671279,this poem is like the anthem of the  white savior it implores its readers to
Z1qYecnkrBk,1671279,1677440,dismiss and discredit whatever the  people they're trying to save have to  say strip them of their agency of their
Z1qYecnkrBk,1677440,1683039,identity continue to drag them to your  definition of civilization no matter how  much they kick and scream and beg you
Z1qYecnkrBk,1683039,1689520,not to no matter how much damage you're  actually doing you can hide behind the  excuse that you are nobly carrying these
Z1qYecnkrBk,1689520,1696080,people away from barbarism and into  refinement this philosophy was also the  key factor in the development of the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1696080,1702480,civilization fund act an act pushing for  the re-education of native americans  with the aim to civilize them
Z1qYecnkrBk,1702480,1708240,benevolently as a result a bunch of  boarding schools catered to native  american children were opened throughout
Z1qYecnkrBk,1708240,1715039,the united states and canada they  operated from the late 1800s all the way  up until the 1960s and they were awful
Z1qYecnkrBk,1715039,1720080,children were taken to these schools  against their will against the will of  their families stripped of their
Z1qYecnkrBk,1720080,1726240,identities punished if they spoke their  language abused and many were killed  historians are still in the process of
Z1qYecnkrBk,1726240,1731520,uncovering numerous mass graves from  these institutions and are still  investigating the extent of the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1731520,1738320,depravities and the inhumanity that  these children were subjected to i will  not pretend to be an expert on this i'm
Z1qYecnkrBk,1738320,1743360,still  learning and still reading as more  information comes along but what i will
Z1qYecnkrBk,1743360,1749360,do is direct you to articles and books  that have helped me out and
Z1qYecnkrBk,1749360,1756960,just generally toward people who can  tell you more or who know more about the  topic than i do i bring up this history
Z1qYecnkrBk,1756960,1763919,the burden as it pertains to this white  supremacist thinking to give a better  idea as to why and how these subgenres
Z1qYecnkrBk,1763919,1768880,can be so inherently questionable or  inherently
Z1qYecnkrBk,1770559,1776559,problematic they are more than just  those spiritual teacher movies about  uplifting students and doing the right
Z1qYecnkrBk,1776559,1782960,thing they are about more than  supporting a confounded youth  desperately searching for meaning  because the framing of these stories
Z1qYecnkrBk,1782960,1789279,echoes these sentiments from the 1800s  the idea that these kids are lost and  that the only way they can be found is
Z1qYecnkrBk,1789279,1796399,through the nobility of a brave or nice  white person and it's tricky because  dangerous minds and freedom writers and
Z1qYecnkrBk,1796399,1802000,that one with matthew perry and that  lifetime one and that other lifetime one  are all based on true stories
Z1qYecnkrBk,1802000,1808559,so what do i want what is the point do i  want white teachers to just not be  helpful to their black students do i
Z1qYecnkrBk,1808559,1815679,want white teachers to not teach at  predominantly black schools no what i do  want is for teachers white or not to
Z1qYecnkrBk,1815679,1820720,avoid going into these schools with this  insidious savior mindset in for white
Z1qYecnkrBk,1820720,1827200,folks who teach in the hood and the rest  of y'all too reality pedagogy and urban  education christopher emdin wrote about
Z1qYecnkrBk,1827200,1833679,his first day teaching at an inner city  school and how he and a fellow teacher  were both projecting on to new freshmen
Z1qYecnkrBk,1833679,1838720,this idea they had of them an idea that  came from media from the news decrying
Z1qYecnkrBk,1838720,1844320,how awful these schools and these  students were and possibly for other  teachers from movies they watched so
Z1qYecnkrBk,1844320,1849919,they could learn how to teach they were  already looking at these kids as if they  were troublemakers when in reality they
Z1qYecnkrBk,1849919,1855679,were just nervous 14 year old kids  wearing their nicest clothes on the  first day of school though our
Z1qYecnkrBk,1855679,1861360,motivations and experiences were  different in the course of our  conversations we learned we had one
Z1qYecnkrBk,1861360,1868159,thing in common to see urban youth of  color as a group that is potentially  dangerous and needs to be saved from
Z1qYecnkrBk,1868159,1874000,themselves for all teachers regardless  of race going into teaching with a  savior mindset leaves students at a
Z1qYecnkrBk,1874000,1880000,disadvantage implicit bias seeps into  the minds of the educators which then  affects how their people see themselves
Z1qYecnkrBk,1880000,1886640,and even how or if they're going to  learn when teachers approach teaching  with themselves in focus with the idea
Z1qYecnkrBk,1886640,1892320,that they and only they are going to fix  or save a student they place themselves
Z1qYecnkrBk,1892320,1899200,on a high ground where they have value  and their students without their aid  don't the belief that students are in
Z1qYecnkrBk,1899200,1904240,need of cleaning up presumes that they  are dirty second the aim of giving them
Z1qYecnkrBk,1904240,1912159,a better life indicates that their  present life has little or no value  saviorism has no place in education
Z1qYecnkrBk,1912159,1917360,saviorism has no place in well  anything and because i know someone's
Z1qYecnkrBk,1917360,1922480,going to be like so what now you don't  want teachers to help their students if  they're white again
Z1qYecnkrBk,1922480,1929360,that's not the point honey the point is  the mentality are you going in with the  mentality that without you precious old
Z1qYecnkrBk,1929360,1935440,you these kids would have no other  opportunities are you going in to pat  yourself on the back about how you could
Z1qYecnkrBk,1935440,1942080,be teaching at a fancy private school  but you're teaching in the inner city  are you looking at your students like  their people or like their projects that
Z1qYecnkrBk,1942080,1947760,need cleaning up are you looking at them  and just seeing criminals are you  projecting ideas onto them without
Z1qYecnkrBk,1947760,1953039,actually knowing them are you  are you a miss morello beyond that the
Z1qYecnkrBk,1953039,1958960,fact is  teaching is [ __ ] hard if not for the  students and for the administration if
Z1qYecnkrBk,1958960,1965120,not for the administration than for the  parents if not for the parents than for  the entire education system as a whole
Z1qYecnkrBk,1965120,1971519,it's a tough and thankless industry and  it's no wonder so many teachers decide  to just call it quits and unsuspecting
Z1qYecnkrBk,1971519,1977519,well-intended would-be teachers don't  need to be lured in by the barrage of  phospiration because not only do they
Z1qYecnkrBk,1977519,1983440,burn themselves out and become so  stressed that it affects their health  but when they start to lose the passion
Z1qYecnkrBk,1983440,1990080,when they inevitably start to lose  interest students who want to learn can  feel that and maybe even they start to
Z1qYecnkrBk,1990080,1995440,wonder  what's the point  we all come in every morning eager to
Z1qYecnkrBk,1995440,2002320,learn but  most of the teachers just seem  completely uninterested in education one  of my teachers miss manley has been
Z1qYecnkrBk,2002320,2009039,particularly hard to work with  she was quiet at first but she showed  some potential i thought maybe she just
Z1qYecnkrBk,2009039,2014159,needed a little time to come out of her  shell but  as the weeks went by she just sat there
Z1qYecnkrBk,2014159,2024609,listlessly at her desk never talking or  participating  [Music]
Z1qYecnkrBk,2025600,2031600,going into teaching with a savior  mentality or what the preconceived  notion on how it will be based on movies
Z1qYecnkrBk,2031600,2037519,or adverts like these don't just impact  the students and how they learn it  impacts the teachers teachers deserve to
Z1qYecnkrBk,2037519,2042559,know what they're getting into  especially lately the teaching world has  not had a moment to re-evaluate
Z1qYecnkrBk,2042559,2049520,schooling since the pandemic and a lot  of teachers are burnt out but even  before the pandemic new teachers often
Z1qYecnkrBk,2049520,2055760,became overwhelmed at how different  teaching was from their expectations  from what they had been told it would be
Z1qYecnkrBk,2055760,2062079,like i have fun trying to estimate how  much money programs like teach for  america have spent on advertising alone
Z1qYecnkrBk,2062079,2068240,they make teaching sound like it's going  to be an amazing experience but once  teachers are in these environments even
Z1qYecnkrBk,2068240,2073440,when they love their students many of  them quickly learned that this was not  everything they thought it would be it's
Z1qYecnkrBk,2073440,2078560,one thing to have a tough student but  it's another thing to feel like your  higher ups don't give a [ __ ] about you
Z1qYecnkrBk,2078560,2084800,your classroom or your health there's  this fantastic video from honest teacher  vibes where she breaks down her
Z1qYecnkrBk,2084800,2090800,experiences with teaching and her  irresponsible administration and how it  all led to her eventually leaving the
Z1qYecnkrBk,2090800,2096480,teaching profession for good and in  recent times this departure has only  accelerated i think being a teacher is
Z1qYecnkrBk,2096480,2102880,one of the hardest jobs in the world  teaching the students and preparing them  for the world beyond school is difficult
Z1qYecnkrBk,2102880,2108880,add to that demeaning parents who think  that you're just a babysitter low income  and an education system that's more
Z1qYecnkrBk,2108880,2115040,fixated on test scores than actual  learning it's an often thankless job and  there's no wonder so many teachers even
Z1qYecnkrBk,2115040,2120960,teachers who have been at this for  decades are ready to move on guess  something that would be semi-accurate to
Z1qYecnkrBk,2120960,2127520,that struggle like that experience would  be  the movie 187. if you've never heard of
Z1qYecnkrBk,2127520,2132960,that movie  i'm about to rock your world maybe  samuel l jackson is this teacher in an
Z1qYecnkrBk,2132960,2139839,inner city school in like new york or  chicago or whatever he has this student  who has scribbled 187 in all of his
Z1qYecnkrBk,2139839,2145520,textbooks which i think is the police  code for homicide this student  apparently has a bone to pick with him
Z1qYecnkrBk,2145520,2151760,and then we see the student and it's  method man and method man stabs samuel  jackson and samuel jackson is almost
Z1qYecnkrBk,2151760,2159119,like he's he's almost dead then a year  later he's at a different school in  california as a substitute teacher and
Z1qYecnkrBk,2159119,2165359,this school is also really bad and  clifton collins jr is like the spawn of  satan or something he's a student that
Z1qYecnkrBk,2165359,2171440,cannot be saved not because he's a bad  student he's just like an evil person  someone gets gunned down right in front
Z1qYecnkrBk,2171440,2177280,of him and he's like all right  let's go get a slushie and i think he  says that exactly but that's the vibe
Z1qYecnkrBk,2177280,2183520,and things escalate between them clifton  collins jr steal samuel jackson's watch  he gets away with it because the
Z1qYecnkrBk,2183520,2189040,principal doesn't give a [ __ ] and then  clifton collins dude keeps trying to  kill samuel jackson and samuel jackson's
Z1qYecnkrBk,2189040,2195838,like i'm trying to teach you why won't  you let me teach you and then they're  dead
Z1qYecnkrBk,2196160,2202480,so  i know a lot of teachers who can relate  to that actually i had a lot of problems  in high school i have a lot of problems
Z1qYecnkrBk,2202480,2209040,now and if not for some of the teachers  i had i'm not even sure i would be where  i am today or who i am today because i
Z1qYecnkrBk,2209040,2215680,had teachers who treated me with respect  they didn't approach me or my situation  like i had to be rescued they saw me as
Z1qYecnkrBk,2215680,2221359,an individual with my own opinions my  own view of the world and they  encouraged me to be my best self without
Z1qYecnkrBk,2221359,2227440,discouraging me they weren't on a  mission to save anyone they were on a  mission to impart whatever wisdom they
Z1qYecnkrBk,2227440,2233040,had to share and maybe that wisdom would  in turn be used to help their young  students come into their own and that's
Z1qYecnkrBk,2233040,2238720,what students need they need teachers  who are supportive patient and willing  to meet them at their level not people
Z1qYecnkrBk,2238720,2245119,who see them as rare specimens to  observe nor as things that will elevate  them somehow either in status or
Z1qYecnkrBk,2245119,2251359,morality and teachers need a real system  of support they shouldn't have to go  into their own pockets to get school
Z1qYecnkrBk,2251359,2256880,supplies parents shouldn't be treating  them like [ __ ] over the smallest things  and they should be paid enough to make a
Z1qYecnkrBk,2256880,2263680,living without feeling like they're  living on breadcrumbs they should not be  ignored by their administration when  they ask for help a lot of these movies
Z1qYecnkrBk,2263680,2268960,are fun to watch and they can be a nice  pick-me-up but some of them have  deep-rooted issues that go beyond a
Z1qYecnkrBk,2268960,2275040,flimsy story their influence on those  who watch them is significant and it's  not just inspiration they're selling
Z1qYecnkrBk,2275040,2281040,it's preconceived notions it's  stereotypes it's implicit bias i guess  there's no harm in enjoying them for
Z1qYecnkrBk,2281040,2287920,what they are but as always be healthily  critical of the art you consume
Z1qYecnkrBk,2288079,2293599,so that is it that is the white teacher  savior savior video
Z1qYecnkrBk,2293599,2298960,that i promised  two years ago i have a lot of people  that i need to thank for their
Z1qYecnkrBk,2298960,2304640,contributions to this video i have to  thank luke who read
Z1qYecnkrBk,2304640,2311119,the white man's  burden poem for me uh did not think he  would say yes but he did and that's
Z1qYecnkrBk,2311119,2316800,amazing i have to think aqua otherwise  known as town of tawya who narrated some
Z1qYecnkrBk,2316800,2322240,of the excerpts from beryl gilroy's  is it a memoir

Z1qYecnkrBk,2397040,2402880,is the simplicity he approaches these  themes with some directors might buckle  under the weight of something so refined
