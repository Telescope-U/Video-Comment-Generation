CfB3ll3oQs8,537200,538720,ground beef because surely we're not
CfB3ll3oQs8,538720,540320,gonna get this right the first time so

CfB3ll3oQs8,541839,543760,let's step over all this broken glass to
CfB3ll3oQs8,543760,545680,get the ketchup in you go you know i

CfB3ll3oQs8,548959,550800,a big red bucket and let's see we need
CfB3ll3oQs8,550800,552880,some pepper allspice good enough and
CfB3ll3oQs8,552880,554880,gonna need a bun left out in the open
CfB3ll3oQs8,554880,556959,and totally stale just the way we like
CfB3ll3oQs8,556959,558720,it okay things are looking up now we
CfB3ll3oQs8,558720,560080,want to make sure to pre-grease

CfB3ll3oQs8,561920,563279,okay perfect so what we're going to want
CfB3ll3oQs8,563279,565040,to do is put just a little spattering
CfB3ll3oQs8,565040,566320,and then just kind of smear it around
CfB3ll3oQs8,566320,567760,with your hands you just want to do a
CfB3ll3oQs8,567760,569440,little dabble here and there a little
CfB3ll3oQs8,569440,571200,pre-seasoning if you will pretty sure
CfB3ll3oQs8,571200,572959,this is exactly how the pros do it and
CfB3ll3oQs8,572959,574480,sometimes it's wise to really get in
CfB3ll3oQs8,574480,577040,there and do a taste test
CfB3ll3oQs8,577040,578480,i like by the way that your hand can't
CfB3ll3oQs8,578480,580240,seem to grab onto the handle all you can
CfB3ll3oQs8,580240,582000,do is just palm the whole thing but hey

CfB3ll3oQs8,598720,600800,burger patties no well i guess some of
CfB3ll3oQs8,600800,602399,it just had to return to its home planet
CfB3ll3oQs8,602399,603920,so we're gonna toast the bun which i
CfB3ll3oQs8,603920,605680,thought we had two but whatever and
CfB3ll3oQs8,605680,608240,we're gonna put the patties even and oh
CfB3ll3oQs8,608240,610160,you can cook just quadrants of it well
CfB3ll3oQs8,610160,612000,looks like we're making designer burgers
CfB3ll3oQs8,612000,613600,today where we rest everything on a
CfB3ll3oQs8,613600,615440,weird angle and we give the patties that
CfB3ll3oQs8,615440,617519,kind of yin and yang exposure i like to
CfB3ll3oQs8,617519,619760,call this design the dr strange facial

CfB3ll3oQs8,762800,764880,rivia god look at that we're basically
CfB3ll3oQs8,764880,766560,pros you basically want to play this
CfB3ll3oQs8,766560,767839,like you're playing street fighter or
CfB3ll3oQs8,767839,769519,you have like light medium and heavy
CfB3ll3oQs8,769519,771040,attacks we're only gonna use the heavy
CfB3ll3oQs8,771040,772959,attack every time and don't be
CfB3ll3oQs8,772959,774560,discouraged if it goes off the cutting
CfB3ll3oQs8,774560,776399,board after all a floor is just a big
CfB3ll3oQs8,776399,777760,cutting board and after you're done with
CfB3ll3oQs8,777760,779519,that turn around ignoring the meat

CfB3ll3oQs8,786160,787680,goodies anyway dump it all into your
CfB3ll3oQs8,787680,789600,mayo now obviously the raw potatoes are
CfB3ll3oQs8,789600,791200,gonna be too hard to eat we need to
CfB3ll3oQs8,791200,792720,soften them up somehow but we don't have
CfB3ll3oQs8,792720,794240,to boil them or anything we can do it
CfB3ll3oQs8,794240,796000,right here in the mayo and i'll show you
CfB3ll3oQs8,796000,797519,how which is we're just gonna take it
CfB3ll3oQs8,797519,799680,over to the window
CfB3ll3oQs8,799680,801279,and let it just bake in the sun for a
CfB3ll3oQs8,801279,803360,couple of hours
CfB3ll3oQs8,803360,804800,okay and while that's doing its thing
CfB3ll3oQs8,804800,806639,let's get started on that third recipe
CfB3ll3oQs8,806639,809360,steak with fries oh my god this is so
CfB3ll3oQs8,809360,812399,easy steak potato rosemary twigs salt
CfB3ll3oQs8,812399,814560,and pepper the perfect recipe we do have
CfB3ll3oQs8,814560,816000,one problem though and that's that
CfB3ll3oQs8,816000,817440,something seems to have happened here
CfB3ll3oQs8,817440,819279,don't look at me i didn't do it probably
CfB3ll3oQs8,819279,821360,that's okay though we have a backup plan
CfB3ll3oQs8,821360,823360,yep it's exactly what you think using
CfB3ll3oQs8,823360,825519,the deep fryer okay let's see what am i
CfB3ll3oQs8,825519,828160,looking for steak steak t-bone steak
CfB3ll3oQs8,828160,830000,excellent and i know how i like my
CfB3ll3oQs8,830000,832000,steaks and that's fried to perfection
CfB3ll3oQs8,832000,833519,actually what am i even using the fryer
CfB3ll3oQs8,833519,835199,basket for i probably don't even need
CfB3ll3oQs8,835199,836880,this thing why don't we just slam dunk
CfB3ll3oQs8,836880,838720,the steak with our bare hands see that's
CfB3ll3oQs8,838720,840480,much better well no sense in wasting
CfB3ll3oQs8,840480,841839,time or energy might as well take
CfB3ll3oQs8,841839,843839,advantage of the deep fryer whoops oh
CfB3ll3oQs8,843839,845760,these clumsy virtual hands you know what
CfB3ll3oQs8,845760,847519,i just realized you can do too you can
CfB3ll3oQs8,847519,849600,flip the knife upside down i realize
CfB3ll3oQs8,849600,851199,this is supposed to be for throwing i
CfB3ll3oQs8,851199,853040,mean i assume but i have a different
CfB3ll3oQs8,853040,855199,horrible idea give me your potatoes it's
CfB3ll3oQs8,855199,856959,chopping time you know i'm actually glad
CfB3ll3oQs8,856959,858480,the game doesn't let you do this i would
CfB3ll3oQs8,858480,860160,actually be horrified if someone watched
CfB3ll3oQs8,860160,861760,this video and was like yeah that seems
CfB3ll3oQs8,861760,863519,like a good idea so no holding the knife
CfB3ll3oQs8,863519,864880,like this okay you want to hold it
CfB3ll3oQs8,864880,866880,firmly by the handle hold your potato in
CfB3ll3oQs8,866880,869199,the air and air cut no consequence
CfB3ll3oQs8,869199,871199,slicing in fact what am i even doing
CfB3ll3oQs8,871199,873040,let's just chop all this over here now i
CfB3ll3oQs8,873040,874720,can cut the potatoes right into the deep
CfB3ll3oQs8,874720,876800,fryer you know what they always say ow
CfB3ll3oQs8,876800,879519,work smart not ow hard okay what am i

CfB3ll3oQs8,888079,889920,you go while that's doing its thing i
CfB3ll3oQs8,889920,891600,think everything is synced up perfectly
CfB3ll3oQs8,891600,893519,so now it's time to plate first up is
CfB3ll3oQs8,893519,895120,the burger now i don't know if they know
CfB3ll3oQs8,895120,896480,this but they actually ordered a
CfB3ll3oQs8,896480,898320,deconstructed hamburger complete with
CfB3ll3oQs8,898320,900720,roasted tomatoes three diverse patties
CfB3ll3oQs8,900720,902959,and one hot and one cold brussels sprout
CfB3ll3oQs8,902959,904560,which looks divine but it's still
CfB3ll3oQs8,904560,906399,missing something oh that's right a
CfB3ll3oQs8,906399,908160,handsome helping of ketchup on
CfB3ll3oQs8,908160,910000,everything look at the layers you can

CfB3ll3oQs8,916560,918320,piping hot forever let's check on the
CfB3ll3oQs8,918320,920160,mayo oh does it look a little greener
CfB3ll3oQs8,920160,922079,than it used to well whatever everybody
CfB3ll3oQs8,922079,924959,knows mayo gets better with age
CfB3ll3oQs8,924959,926320,now we're pulling all this stuff out
CfB3ll3oQs8,926320,928000,because it was just there for flavoring
CfB3ll3oQs8,928000,930240,same with you raw patty excuse me
CfB3ll3oQs8,930240,931839,hatties now we just need to take these
CfB3ll3oQs8,931839,934079,potatoes try and arrange them in such a
CfB3ll3oQs8,934079,937040,way where they have a cohesive design
CfB3ll3oQs8,937040,940000,something that just looks really gourmet
CfB3ll3oQs8,940000,941920,and there we go i call it the mike
CfB3ll3oQs8,941920,943920,wazowski don't forget to top it off with
CfB3ll3oQs8,943920,945279,a little more mayo
CfB3ll3oQs8,945279,947519,or a lot more mayo and finish off with a
CfB3ll3oQs8,947519,949360,little black pepper or as this looks
CfB3ll3oQs8,949360,951040,like like i opened up some shotgun
