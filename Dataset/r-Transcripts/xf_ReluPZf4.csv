xf_ReluPZf4,100,2000,- [Ken] How much do you think we spent?
xf_ReluPZf4,2000,2833,- I don't know.
xf_ReluPZf4,3890,5440,- [Matt] Throw a number out.
xf_ReluPZf4,5440,8036,"- 279.99. - No, higher."
xf_ReluPZf4,8036,9967,"- Double it. - Higher, higher."
xf_ReluPZf4,9967,12012,- $560. - Higher.
xf_ReluPZf4,12012,14603,"- A thousand, $1,120. - Higher."
xf_ReluPZf4,14603,16449,Is this a math question?
xf_ReluPZf4,16450,17869,"- Higher, yes. - Double that."
xf_ReluPZf4,17869,18719,- $1240. - Nope.
xf_ReluPZf4,19690,20700,That's not double. - That's not double.
xf_ReluPZf4,20700,23712,"- 2240, 2240. - Close enough."
xf_ReluPZf4,23712,25723,- [Ken] That's how much we spent on this.
xf_ReluPZf4,25723,26564,- What the?
xf_ReluPZf4,26565,27872,Is this Price is Right?
xf_ReluPZf4,27872,29810,(Ken groaning) - Dammit.
xf_ReluPZf4,29810,31359,"- You spent $2,000 on a box?"
xf_ReluPZf4,31360,35860,Apparently it has Spotify and Airplay.
xf_ReluPZf4,35860,38190,"So is this a really expensive, stupid speaker?"
xf_ReluPZf4,38190,39859,"- [Matt] No, clearly a refrigerator."
xf_ReluPZf4,39860,41030,"- [Ken] Yes, you."
xf_ReluPZf4,41030,42120,Oh my God.
xf_ReluPZf4,42120,43390,"What, what, what else could it be?"
xf_ReluPZf4,43390,44223,"- [Ken 2] So full disclosure,"
xf_ReluPZf4,44223,46843,I actually did find this on Instagram
xf_ReluPZf4,46843,50030,and usually these things are like Kickstarters
xf_ReluPZf4,50030,51120,"that like don't really exist,"
xf_ReluPZf4,51120,53469,but I was surprised that this one actually showed up.
xf_ReluPZf4,53470,54670,"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
xf_ReluPZf4,54670,56787,"You spent $2,000 on a random product you found on Instagram"
xf_ReluPZf4,56787,58673,and you're surprised it showed up?
xf_ReluPZf4,58673,60387,(Ken laughing) - Yeah.
xf_ReluPZf4,60387,61220,"- Cell Alpha, welcome to a new sound."
xf_ReluPZf4,61220,62270,"Any number, any layout."
xf_ReluPZf4,62270,64489,Place your cells how they best fit in your space.
xf_ReluPZf4,64489,67210,"- [Ken] I could have bought more, but I spared you."
xf_ReluPZf4,67210,68290,- [Matt] I like how it's implied
xf_ReluPZf4,68290,70233,that you could buy like five of these.
xf_ReluPZf4,72860,73693,"- Oh, wow."
xf_ReluPZf4,73693,75600,"I mean, that is quite some packaging I will say."
xf_ReluPZf4,75600,77840,It looks like Marty Mcfly's leftovers.
xf_ReluPZf4,77840,80579,- [Ken] It's like a space star burst.
xf_ReluPZf4,80580,83610,(packaging tears) - It just keeps going.
xf_ReluPZf4,83610,84750,What the hell is this?
xf_ReluPZf4,84750,88900,Inside box number one is more.
xf_ReluPZf4,88900,90017,"What, what the?"
xf_ReluPZf4,93153,93986,Uh huh.
xf_ReluPZf4,95590,97052,Remove before assembly.
xf_ReluPZf4,98542,101060,(packaging crinkles)
xf_ReluPZf4,101060,103132,"Oh, sweet baby Jesus."
xf_ReluPZf4,104400,107150,"- [Ken] No, it says remove after assembly."
xf_ReluPZf4,107150,109090,Look it says after. - After.
xf_ReluPZf4,109090,111003,- [Ken] Where did you see before?
xf_ReluPZf4,112076,113140,Let it.
xf_ReluPZf4,113140,114890,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
xf_ReluPZf4,116393,117543,"no, no, no, no, no, no."
xf_ReluPZf4,120069,123486,How can you be so criminally bad at this?
xf_ReluPZf4,124606,126802,"- [Jared] Before you, I need to do another take."
xf_ReluPZf4,126802,128257,- Doesn't it need to go through here?
xf_ReluPZf4,128257,129345,"- Oh, you're right."
xf_ReluPZf4,129345,132018,"- How can you be so criminally bad at this, Ken?"
xf_ReluPZf4,132018,133010,- Fair enough.
xf_ReluPZf4,133010,135220,"- The Triphon, a three horn system projects sound"
xf_ReluPZf4,135220,136560,with pinpoint accuracy.
xf_ReluPZf4,136560,138720,"Single point source, all sound emanates from the core"
xf_ReluPZf4,138720,140760,delivering unmatched clarity and perfect timber.
xf_ReluPZf4,140760,141790,"All right, is everyone ready?"
xf_ReluPZf4,141790,143430,We're about to start a sound check.
xf_ReluPZf4,143430,144870,I don't know what's about to happen.
xf_ReluPZf4,144870,146670,I have big expectations.
xf_ReluPZf4,146670,148362,Start sound check now.
xf_ReluPZf4,150710,152361,"It is updating software, nevermind."
xf_ReluPZf4,152361,153260,(Ken laughing)
xf_ReluPZf4,153260,155629,- [Jared] I am ready for the AURAL experience
xf_ReluPZf4,155630,156470,that we're about to
xf_ReluPZf4,156470,158720,"- You're about to experience some oral bliss, friends."
xf_ReluPZf4,158720,160376,- Aural! - Oral bliss is on the way.
xf_ReluPZf4,160376,162130,"- [Jared] AURAL, AURAL."
xf_ReluPZf4,162130,163640,- Apologies to everyone at home.
xf_ReluPZf4,163640,164900,I'm about to play copyrighted music.
xf_ReluPZf4,164900,166579,"So, edit team,"
xf_ReluPZf4,166580,169540,"please put on some friendly, royalty free music"
xf_ReluPZf4,169540,170883,so everyone can see how great this sounds.
xf_ReluPZf4,170883,171715,Wait.
xf_ReluPZf4,171716,172549,"No, no, no."
xf_ReluPZf4,172549,173489,There's a royalty free track.
xf_ReluPZf4,173490,175337,"We can actually listen to altogether, okay."
xf_ReluPZf4,175337,177837,(dance music)
xf_ReluPZf4,187501,188553,(all laughing)
xf_ReluPZf4,189144,190894,What's wrong with us?
xf_ReluPZf4,190894,193649,This is one of the most expensive mystery tech items ever.
xf_ReluPZf4,193649,198755,"The fact that one of these speakers is $1,800,"
xf_ReluPZf4,198755,202251,"for mere mortals like us, is blowing our minds."
xf_ReluPZf4,202251,205355,"- Yeah and it's not even that crazy like deep bass,"
xf_ReluPZf4,205355,206293,- Yeah.
xf_ReluPZf4,206293,207648,- but it still packs a punch
xf_ReluPZf4,207648,210870,"and it's again, as you said, it's even."
xf_ReluPZf4,210870,212730,- You know what we should do right now?
xf_ReluPZf4,212730,215950,We should take a moment and appreciate mystery
xf_ReluPZf4,215950,217946,because you know what we don't have enough in the world?
xf_ReluPZf4,217946,219200,Mystery.
xf_ReluPZf4,219200,221984,- [Ken] Wasn't (beep) good enough for you?
xf_ReluPZf4,221984,225487,- Oh my god. (Ken laughing)
xf_ReluPZf4,225488,227030,- [Ken] It sounded way better in my.
xf_ReluPZf4,227030,228788,"I don't know why, it sounded way better."
xf_ReluPZf4,228788,230830,"- Yeah, (indistinct). (Ken laughing)"
xf_ReluPZf4,230830,231877,"- Boy, what the?"
xf_ReluPZf4,234822,237959,Is that a F1 wheel? - It's not just a 1.
xf_ReluPZf4,237959,238792,- Did you break it?
xf_ReluPZf4,238792,239650,Did you break the wheel?
xf_ReluPZf4,239650,241629,"- [Ken] No, it came like that."
xf_ReluPZf4,241630,242650,- You dropped the wheel?
xf_ReluPZf4,242650,244840,"Really, really, really, really, really hard?"
xf_ReluPZf4,244840,246190,- [Ken] I dropped the wheel sideways
xf_ReluPZf4,246190,248903,and by me I meant Sergio Perez.
xf_ReluPZf4,251030,253800,"- Can I ask, oh wait,"
xf_ReluPZf4,253800,255620,is this for what I think it is?
xf_ReluPZf4,255620,258492,- Yes. - Oh.
xf_ReluPZf4,259769,261930,You might want to subscribe
xf_ReluPZf4,261930,263930,and ring a ling that ding a ling button.
xf_ReluPZf4,265433,267760,We got some cool stuff coming up.
xf_ReluPZf4,267760,269630,I can't say anything about it though.
xf_ReluPZf4,269630,272730,"You realize, I can't say anything right now."
xf_ReluPZf4,272730,273770,I.
xf_ReluPZf4,273770,274940,"- [Ken] I will, I will."
xf_ReluPZf4,274940,277663,I will be very subtle with my euphemism.
xf_ReluPZf4,282760,284243,"- Wow, Ken, subtle."
xf_ReluPZf4,287060,292060,The Kensington SD5700T Thunderbolt 4 Dual 4K dock.
xf_ReluPZf4,292180,294000,Are you about to give me a great segue
xf_ReluPZf4,294000,295830,"to the sponsor of today's mystery tech,"
xf_ReluPZf4,295830,297960,Intel's wonderful Thunderbolt technology
xf_ReluPZf4,297960,299560,powered by Evo laptops.
xf_ReluPZf4,299560,300410,"Oh, okay."
xf_ReluPZf4,300410,301243,All right.
xf_ReluPZf4,301243,306243,"The Sabrent Rocket USB C external aluminum SSD,"
xf_ReluPZf4,306480,307550,oh there's a bunch of stuff here.
xf_ReluPZf4,307550,308650,There's an enclosure.
xf_ReluPZf4,308650,309580,Oh wow.
xf_ReluPZf4,309580,313253,So we have three Thunderbolt SSDs
xf_ReluPZf4,313253,317800,and is that an Intel Evo powered Lenovo Yoga laptop?
xf_ReluPZf4,317800,319244,- Yes it is. - Oh boy.
xf_ReluPZf4,319244,321659,"Okay, so there's a lot to break down here."
xf_ReluPZf4,321660,324130,So you're probably familiar with Thunderbolt.
xf_ReluPZf4,324130,326510,This is a technology developed by Intel.
xf_ReluPZf4,326510,327830,"That's been through many iterations,"
xf_ReluPZf4,327830,329620,but essentially it is sort of like the ultimate port
xf_ReluPZf4,329620,331389,"because with a single Thunderbolt port,"
xf_ReluPZf4,331390,333056,"not only can you power your device,"
xf_ReluPZf4,333056,337120,but you also have 40 gigabits per second throughput.
xf_ReluPZf4,337120,338750,"So with my dock,"
xf_ReluPZf4,338750,343750,"I can do dual 4k displays or an 8K display,"
xf_ReluPZf4,345100,348300,on top of all the other nonsense that I'm going to plugin.
xf_ReluPZf4,348300,349133,"Oh, what the?"
xf_ReluPZf4,349133,351960,"Oh, is that a Thunderbolt display?"
xf_ReluPZf4,351960,353539,- It is a Thunderbolt display.
xf_ReluPZf4,353540,355380,- That's a big chungus if I've ever seen a big chungus.
xf_ReluPZf4,355380,356930,Is that a 38 inch?
xf_ReluPZf4,356930,361570,"- [Ken] This a 34 inch, 1440P high Thunderbolt display."
xf_ReluPZf4,361570,363290,- So I'm going build a whole set up right now.
xf_ReluPZf4,363290,364123,- Yes. - Okay.
xf_ReluPZf4,364123,366180,"- So I don't know if you saw, - Yeah."
xf_ReluPZf4,366180,368620,"- But - We have three individual,"
xf_ReluPZf4,368620,369643,how big are this? - Did you see this one?
xf_ReluPZf4,369643,371675,- No.
xf_ReluPZf4,371675,376569,Eight terabytes over Thunderbolt SSD?
xf_ReluPZf4,376570,380060,- [Ken] So they're rating just under 3000 megabytes
xf_ReluPZf4,380060,381584,per second. - Wow.
xf_ReluPZf4,381584,383990,"So it will go down to USB,"
xf_ReluPZf4,383990,386203,but obviously you get the best speeds with Thunderbolt.
xf_ReluPZf4,386203,390110,"2,700 megabytes per second."
xf_ReluPZf4,390110,392009,That is extremely fast.
xf_ReluPZf4,392010,392843,Wow.
xf_ReluPZf4,392843,395360,"So this is an eight terabyte, two terabyte,"
xf_ReluPZf4,395360,396490,and two terabyte.
xf_ReluPZf4,396490,397479,- [Ken] That sounds like it'll be great
xf_ReluPZf4,397480,399040,for video editing. - So we're going to start out
xf_ReluPZf4,399040,399873,with the dock.
xf_ReluPZf4,399873,401599,So we have the Thunderbolt in.
xf_ReluPZf4,401600,404830,"We have USB A, SD card, and headphone jack,"
xf_ReluPZf4,404830,406150,as well as little power button.
xf_ReluPZf4,406150,408479,"But on the back we have three more Thunderbolt ports,"
xf_ReluPZf4,408480,409696,so we can load it up with SSDs.
xf_ReluPZf4,409696,413253,We have ethernet and a bunch more 10 gig USB 3.0 ports.
xf_ReluPZf4,414770,416166,Okay.
xf_ReluPZf4,416166,416999,So this is a great place to start.
xf_ReluPZf4,416999,418740,So one of the nice things about Thunderbolt is that
xf_ReluPZf4,418740,421560,it is essentially the do everything port.
xf_ReluPZf4,421560,422550,"So with a single cable,"
xf_ReluPZf4,422550,425206,"I'm going to plug in this Yoga laptop,"
xf_ReluPZf4,425206,426430,which of course is EVO certified.
xf_ReluPZf4,426430,428550,"Then it is going to turn on our dock,"
xf_ReluPZf4,428550,430354,"which has our mouse, ethernets,"
xf_ReluPZf4,430355,433340,as well as we have our three SSDs
xf_ReluPZf4,433340,435340,and the display all connected.
xf_ReluPZf4,435340,437790,"Again, this is all coming from a single cable."
xf_ReluPZf4,437790,439190,- [Ken] And that was fairly quick too.
xf_ReluPZf4,439190,440023,"- Fairly fast, right?"
xf_ReluPZf4,440023,440856,Everything just lights up.
xf_ReluPZf4,440856,441689,It's good to go.
xf_ReluPZf4,441689,443300,And the cool thing about Thunderbolt is that
xf_ReluPZf4,443300,445199,it really kind of allows you to do everything
xf_ReluPZf4,445200,448660,because I could just as easily plug in a USB C cable.
xf_ReluPZf4,448660,450050,"I could just be charging the laptop,"
xf_ReluPZf4,450050,452250,"which this is being charged right now, by the way."
xf_ReluPZf4,452250,454003,Or you could even do something as simple as use this
xf_ReluPZf4,454003,457590,to go out to like just a single external display
xf_ReluPZf4,457590,460040,or an external graphics card or wherever the case is.
xf_ReluPZf4,460040,461510,I use Thunderbolt on a daily basis.
xf_ReluPZf4,461510,463150,I use a Thunderbolt display on my desk.
xf_ReluPZf4,463150,464544,I have since like 2016
xf_ReluPZf4,464544,466900,and it's nice because it really allows you to do
xf_ReluPZf4,466900,467949,pretty much everything.
xf_ReluPZf4,467950,469530,"Now, all you need is the one cable."
xf_ReluPZf4,469530,472050,"Unplug it, grab your laptop, and you're good to go."
xf_ReluPZf4,472050,473889,"I mean, it's hard to argue with that."
xf_ReluPZf4,473890,475630,"Wait, I'm not, well, I'm not done."
xf_ReluPZf4,475630,476510,I was about to walk off.
xf_ReluPZf4,476510,477343,I'm not done yet.
xf_ReluPZf4,477343,479470,"So you'd like to know more about Intel's fine,"
xf_ReluPZf4,479470,481940,"Thunderbolt technology, their EVO laptops,"
xf_ReluPZf4,481940,483780,and of course the wide variety of accessories
xf_ReluPZf4,483780,485020,"that are available for them,"
xf_ReluPZf4,485020,486629,definitely be sure to go check that out at the link
xf_ReluPZf4,486630,488670,in the description and huge shout out to Intel
xf_ReluPZf4,488670,491123,for sponsoring this episode of Mystery Tech.
xf_ReluPZf4,494360,496090,Just lay it on me. - What?
xf_ReluPZf4,496090,497680,- Just lay it on me. - What are doing?
xf_ReluPZf4,497680,498587,No.
xf_ReluPZf4,498588,500560,Lay what on you?
xf_ReluPZf4,500560,501480,I'm not laying on you.
xf_ReluPZf4,501480,502623,- Throw my way.
xf_ReluPZf4,503640,504473,Wing it.
xf_ReluPZf4,504473,505990,- [Ken] I have hid the product
xf_ReluPZf4,505990,507500,that you're going to take a look at somewhere
xf_ReluPZf4,507500,509300,in the room and you have to find it.
xf_ReluPZf4,510940,511773,- It's in your hand.
xf_ReluPZf4,511773,512830,I see it.
xf_ReluPZf4,512830,513890,"- [Ken] No, this is a different product."
xf_ReluPZf4,513890,514723,- No there's not.
xf_ReluPZf4,514723,515556,You're tricking me.
xf_ReluPZf4,515556,517669,I see a product in your hand right now.
xf_ReluPZf4,517669,519419,You want me to look around the set?
xf_ReluPZf4,520969,522763,You just tricked me.
xf_ReluPZf4,522763,524579,That was a duplicitous move.
xf_ReluPZf4,524580,527203,These are the AirPods 3.
xf_ReluPZf4,530010,532040,I am skeptical
xf_ReluPZf4,532040,535540,"because while the upgrades to the AirPods 3, you know,"
xf_ReluPZf4,535540,537180,"having the new design and whatnot,"
xf_ReluPZf4,537180,538632,"are cool, spatial audio."
xf_ReluPZf4,538632,542320,These retail for $180.
xf_ReluPZf4,542320,543300,"At that kind of price,"
xf_ReluPZf4,543300,544769,you can get a lot of headphones
xf_ReluPZf4,544770,546890,"that have active noise cancellation,"
xf_ReluPZf4,546890,548410,like the Beats Studio Buds
xf_ReluPZf4,548410,550139,"that I've reviewed on Mystery Tech previously,"
xf_ReluPZf4,550140,551510,"which I actually really like,"
xf_ReluPZf4,551510,553805,but one of the things I'm probably most excited for
xf_ReluPZf4,553805,556029,"is wow, that's a small case, "
xf_ReluPZf4,556030,557100,is the sound quality
xf_ReluPZf4,557100,559258,because supposedly these AirPods sound better.
xf_ReluPZf4,559258,562270,I've never been a huge fan of the way the AirPods sound.
xf_ReluPZf4,562270,565330,"They always sound fine, but nothing more than that."
xf_ReluPZf4,565330,567870,My test is always does it fit in the coin pocket?
xf_ReluPZf4,567870,569927,So I'll take out my headphones.
xf_ReluPZf4,569927,571500,"And that is, I mean, that's,"
xf_ReluPZf4,571500,573740,those might be the smallest case
xf_ReluPZf4,573740,576660,I've ever actually used for a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.
xf_ReluPZf4,576660,578019,"That's really, really good."
xf_ReluPZf4,578020,580700,A lot of people like regular AirPods
xf_ReluPZf4,580700,583320,because they have plastic tips instead of rubber.
xf_ReluPZf4,583320,584840,I was actually like that for a long time.
xf_ReluPZf4,584840,586770,It took me years before I was really comfortable
xf_ReluPZf4,586770,587970,with rubber ear tips.
xf_ReluPZf4,587970,589360,"I've kind of gotten used to it,"
xf_ReluPZf4,589360,590730,"but there is certainly something,"
xf_ReluPZf4,590730,592959,"especially depending on like the size of your ear,"
xf_ReluPZf4,592960,594765,to the idea of using the plastic tip.
xf_ReluPZf4,594765,595598,All right.
xf_ReluPZf4,595598,596744,Let's see how they sound.
xf_ReluPZf4,596744,598180,(faint music)
xf_ReluPZf4,598180,599073,You know what?
xf_ReluPZf4,600270,603299,Not bad. - Is your hearing okay?
xf_ReluPZf4,603299,604835,- You can definitely hear my music?
xf_ReluPZf4,604835,608270,"- Yeah, 100%. - It's at like 85 decibels."
xf_ReluPZf4,608270,610820,It's definitely not good for your hearing.
xf_ReluPZf4,610820,612190,"- Thanks, Dad."
xf_ReluPZf4,612190,614000,"- So the thing is, what you're missing here"
xf_ReluPZf4,614000,615880,really is the active noise cancellation.
xf_ReluPZf4,615880,616800,Definitely not here.
xf_ReluPZf4,616800,618839,"100%, I can hear everything around me."
xf_ReluPZf4,618840,620060,"The AirPods are pretty solid,"
xf_ReluPZf4,620060,624920,but I also have recently got a pair of the Beats Fit Pros.
xf_ReluPZf4,624920,627940,So these are similar I would say in a lot of ways
xf_ReluPZf4,627940,630630,to the Beats Studio Buds.
xf_ReluPZf4,630630,634310,The Beats are only $20 more than the AirPods
xf_ReluPZf4,634310,635900,"and while they don't have MagSafe,"
xf_ReluPZf4,635900,637890,they do have active noise cancellation
xf_ReluPZf4,637890,639870,and they had the cool little light design
xf_ReluPZf4,639870,640870,that fits in your ears.
xf_ReluPZf4,640870,641860,I've spent some time.
xf_ReluPZf4,641860,643608,I just got DM'd by Taco Bell.
xf_ReluPZf4,643608,645050,(laughing)
xf_ReluPZf4,645050,645883,That's a weird thing.
xf_ReluPZf4,645883,647240,Okay.
xf_ReluPZf4,647240,649652,"- They sent a photo. - Oh, oh."
xf_ReluPZf4,649652,652230,"- Y'all stay out of my DMs, okay."
xf_ReluPZf4,652230,653063,"- I want, - I want to know."
xf_ReluPZf4,653063,654686,- I want. - Absolutely not.
xf_ReluPZf4,654686,656548,- You got DM'd by Taco Bell?
xf_ReluPZf4,656548,658800,(Ken laughing)
xf_ReluPZf4,658800,660350,"- [Ken] Yo, is Taco Bell DTF?"
xf_ReluPZf4,662940,665120,"- I shouldn't be surprised, but I guess I am."
xf_ReluPZf4,665120,666410,They're actually really similar.
xf_ReluPZf4,666410,668740,Both of them actually have similar sounds.
xf_ReluPZf4,668740,670520,"Like I'll still say the Beats sound a little better,"
xf_ReluPZf4,670520,672760,but that almost seems more like a consequence
xf_ReluPZf4,672760,674010,"because they're actually sealed,"
xf_ReluPZf4,674010,676000,which I think always just kind of helps to improve
xf_ReluPZf4,676000,677230,sort of sound quality.
xf_ReluPZf4,677230,678063,"- But here's the thing,"
xf_ReluPZf4,678063,681029,AirPods Pros are usually - Are about the same price.
xf_ReluPZf4,681030,684760,- around $180 anyway. - Yeah. These are 200
xf_ReluPZf4,684760,685982,and these are 180 MSRP.
xf_ReluPZf4,685982,688510,"AirPods Pros technically cost 250,"
xf_ReluPZf4,688510,691300,"but you can find them 200 bucks, 170, 180 bucks,"
xf_ReluPZf4,691300,692133,pretty easily.
xf_ReluPZf4,692133,693150,"- [Ken] The Android argument's one thing,"
xf_ReluPZf4,693150,694461,"but if you're on the Apple side,"
xf_ReluPZf4,694461,697200,just wait for the Pros to be on sale again.
xf_ReluPZf4,697200,698410,"- That being said though,"
xf_ReluPZf4,698410,701500,I actually still like the Beats Studio Buds.
xf_ReluPZf4,701500,702790,They're 150 bucks.
xf_ReluPZf4,702790,704070,They have most of the same features
xf_ReluPZf4,704070,705620,except they have the small case.
xf_ReluPZf4,705620,707123,They had the active noise cancellation
xf_ReluPZf4,707123,708920,and they work well with Android.
xf_ReluPZf4,708920,712480,"On top of that, the Beats Studio Buds are $150 retail,"
xf_ReluPZf4,712480,715230,"but regularly go on sale for like 120, 130 bucks."
xf_ReluPZf4,715230,716600,"Out of all these headphones,"
xf_ReluPZf4,716600,718319,those actually are probably my pick.
xf_ReluPZf4,718320,720560,"I don't think these make sense, 180 bucks."
xf_ReluPZf4,720560,723040,And I think these are okay at 200.
xf_ReluPZf4,723040,725040,I think the Beats Studio Buds are actually my favorite.
xf_ReluPZf4,725040,727070,"- But, here's the thing. - Yeah."
xf_ReluPZf4,727070,728090,- [Ken] AirPods 3.
xf_ReluPZf4,728090,730083,Got the flex.
xf_ReluPZf4,730970,732660,- Is that even a flex anymore?
xf_ReluPZf4,732660,735319,I feel like half the $20 wish earbuds you buy
xf_ReluPZf4,735320,736880,look exactly like AirPods anyways.
xf_ReluPZf4,736880,737713,"- [Ken] Yeah, they just."
xf_ReluPZf4,737713,739680,They're twice the size in your ear
xf_ReluPZf4,739680,741226,- No.
xf_ReluPZf4,741226,742520,- [Ken] and people don't think I notice.
xf_ReluPZf4,742520,745666,- So then I told them that what we really need
xf_ReluPZf4,745666,749520,is some tech that's actually not super expensive
xf_ReluPZf4,749520,750470,and he just laughed.
xf_ReluPZf4,750470,753089,"Ow, did you just throw something at me?"
xf_ReluPZf4,753090,755460,"I'm having a chat with the director of,"
xf_ReluPZf4,755460,756293,"okay, that's fine."
xf_ReluPZf4,756293,757126,That's fine.
xf_ReluPZf4,757126,761462,This is the Pocket Tripod Pro.
xf_ReluPZf4,762610,764070,How much is a pocket tripod?
xf_ReluPZf4,764070,767750,- [Ken] I bought them for 35 each.
xf_ReluPZf4,767750,768700,I have one as well.
xf_ReluPZf4,770040,771259,- 35 Bucks.
xf_ReluPZf4,771260,773340,"Okay, that's not outrageous."
xf_ReluPZf4,773340,775250,They look a little like a JOBY pods there.
xf_ReluPZf4,775250,777132,That's about the same price.
xf_ReluPZf4,777132,778078,Wow.
xf_ReluPZf4,778078,778911,Okay.
xf_ReluPZf4,778911,780130,"If this isn't a complete pile of garbage,"
xf_ReluPZf4,780130,781830,this is actually going to be cool.
xf_ReluPZf4,783070,783903,- [Ken] What?
xf_ReluPZf4,785239,786610,What are you?
xf_ReluPZf4,786610,787589,"No, no."
xf_ReluPZf4,787590,789110,Go like this.
xf_ReluPZf4,789110,791160,- Rotate around. - They're together now.
xf_ReluPZf4,792296,793400,"- Oh, oh, I see."
xf_ReluPZf4,793400,794340,Okay.
xf_ReluPZf4,794340,796040,"You're you're you're you're smart, Mr. Bolido."
xf_ReluPZf4,796040,796873,You're smart.
xf_ReluPZf4,796873,799959,So now I'm going to hit record on the iPhone.
xf_ReluPZf4,799960,802920,- Yeah. - If we want a
xf_ReluPZf4,804052,806160,"Roboraptor POV camera,"
xf_ReluPZf4,806160,807810,we can just look at what it looks like
xf_ReluPZf4,807810,809090,to be Roboraptor all day.
xf_ReluPZf4,809090,811460,"- [Ken] See, I want that for the plane"
xf_ReluPZf4,811460,813140,so that I can watch videos on it
xf_ReluPZf4,813140,814873,and also have that in my wallet.
xf_ReluPZf4,816135,818718,(Austin humming Zelda music)
xf_ReluPZf4,820861,822227,- Whoa.
xf_ReluPZf4,822227,824380,Wow. That was really high.
xf_ReluPZf4,824380,826590,That will almost hit the top camera.
xf_ReluPZf4,826590,827960,"Hello, welcome friends,"
xf_ReluPZf4,827960,832000,to a very exciting time for me to unbox an item
xf_ReluPZf4,832000,835100,that I single-handedly saved from the clutches of Ken
xf_ReluPZf4,835100,837902,who almost wrecked. - I think you used two hands
xf_ReluPZf4,837902,838735,for that.
xf_ReluPZf4,838735,843420,"- Double handedly saved from the wicked witch himself,"
xf_ReluPZf4,843420,845743,Ken. - I think it's on brand.
xf_ReluPZf4,847140,851607,"- What? - Inside, the many layers"
xf_ReluPZf4,852540,857540,of the box is this Surface Duo.
xf_ReluPZf4,859862,863640,The Duo. - What is wrong with you?
xf_ReluPZf4,863640,864480,Jesus.
xf_ReluPZf4,864480,866449,- Now this is actually one of those rare items
xf_ReluPZf4,866450,869080,that I've actually been able to try beforehand.
xf_ReluPZf4,869080,871960,So we actually went to a sort of pre-brief hands-on
xf_ReluPZf4,871960,873700,of this a few weeks ago.
xf_ReluPZf4,873700,876900,"I got what, 20 minutes to play with the phone."
xf_ReluPZf4,876900,878780,"And in that 20 minutes, I was very impressed."
xf_ReluPZf4,878780,882010,"So one of the first things you'll notice is this has a much,"
xf_ReluPZf4,882010,883700,"much larger camera bump, AKA,"
xf_ReluPZf4,883700,885610,it has a real set of cameras.
xf_ReluPZf4,885610,888470,"So the first Duo only had a front facing camera,"
xf_ReluPZf4,888470,890259,"which you could kind of flip around,"
xf_ReluPZf4,890260,893640,but this now has a proper triple camera setup.
xf_ReluPZf4,893640,896470,"It has an ultra wide, a wide, and a telephoto."
xf_ReluPZf4,896470,898300,"The thing is, if you look at these two devices, right?"
xf_ReluPZf4,898300,900292,"So the original Duo, as well as the Duo two,"
xf_ReluPZf4,900292,901960,they're incredibly thin.
xf_ReluPZf4,901960,904000,"And when it comes to designing cameras,"
xf_ReluPZf4,904000,905300,"the whole reason why, again,"
xf_ReluPZf4,905300,906733,"I'm just going to pull out,"
xf_ReluPZf4,906733,908029,the Pixel has this huge camera bump
xf_ReluPZf4,908030,910520,"is because for a large camera and a large sensor,"
xf_ReluPZf4,910520,913010,"large lens, you just need some depth, right."
xf_ReluPZf4,913010,915640,Which is why they have to sort of chonktastic it up.
xf_ReluPZf4,915640,917472,- [Ken] So the camera bump is angled.
xf_ReluPZf4,917472,918305,- Yes. 
xf_ReluPZf4,918305,920460,- [Ken] So that it's not going to scratch
xf_ReluPZf4,920460,921293,the back of the phone.
xf_ReluPZf4,921293,922380,So while there is a bump
xf_ReluPZf4,922380,924170,"and it's not a perfect fold anymore,"
xf_ReluPZf4,924170,926410,it's actually at least thought about.
xf_ReluPZf4,926410,928800,"- So I have now installed the case,"
xf_ReluPZf4,928800,930600,"which calling this a case, I think,"
xf_ReluPZf4,930600,932040,is kind of a overstating it
xf_ReluPZf4,932040,933558,because it is incredibly thin.
xf_ReluPZf4,933558,934570,But the nice thing is
xf_ReluPZf4,934570,936700,"not only does it have a magnetic spot for your pen,"
xf_ReluPZf4,936700,938640,but it also wirelessly charges it.
xf_ReluPZf4,938640,940523,"Because of the dual screen nature of this,"
xf_ReluPZf4,940523,945270,you kind of need a lot of additional software support.
xf_ReluPZf4,945270,946660,"So let me run you through some of the speeds and feeds,"
xf_ReluPZf4,946660,951660,"Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, NFC, giant battery,"
xf_ReluPZf4,953061,954610,"as well as you've got the two very large displays,"
xf_ReluPZf4,954610,956260,"which are now curved on the inside,"
xf_ReluPZf4,956260,957630,which means that as you look
xf_ReluPZf4,957630,959547,"and you scroll between them,"
xf_ReluPZf4,959547,960440,"not only does it feel nice with your finger,"
xf_ReluPZf4,960440,962800,"but also it is very, very much seamless."
xf_ReluPZf4,962800,964573,Today I'm going to react to a classic
xf_ReluPZf4,964573,966500,using the Surface Duo.
xf_ReluPZf4,966500,968390,"Hello, welcome to my YouTube channel"
xf_ReluPZf4,968390,971600,where I am a reactor reacting to
xf_ReluPZf4,971600,973404,this heavily requested video
xf_ReluPZf4,973404,976540,of a certain tech tip man
xf_ReluPZf4,976540,979263,and his important thoughts.
xf_ReluPZf4,982750,983583,Great intro.
xf_ReluPZf4,983583,984673,Very enthusiastic.
xf_ReluPZf4,985840,986950,He's now talking.
xf_ReluPZf4,986950,988230,- [Ken] Austin.
xf_ReluPZf4,988230,989329,Tell me about the Duo.
xf_ReluPZf4,990629,991462,What do you think?
xf_ReluPZf4,991462,993050,- What accent was that? - I'm going to go leave now
xf_ReluPZf4,993050,994899,- [Ken] A mix of Australian and British.
xf_ReluPZf4,994900,995733,- Thank you.
xf_ReluPZf4,995733,996730,Make sure you subscribe.
xf_ReluPZf4,996730,998440,"Don't encourage Ken,"
xf_ReluPZf4,998440,1002290,but subscribe to me and you'll get content
xf_ReluPZf4,1002290,1003123,that's actually good.
xf_ReluPZf4,1003123,1004760,Unlike what you're watching right now.
