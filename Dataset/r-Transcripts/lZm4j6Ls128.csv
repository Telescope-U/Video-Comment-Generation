lZm4j6Ls128,0,2220,a herniated disc is one of the most
lZm4j6Ls128,2220,4470,common spinal diseases that can lead to
lZm4j6Ls128,4470,8450,mild to severe pain in your neck or back
lZm4j6Ls128,8450,12340,there are 24 vertebrae in the spine
lZm4j6Ls128,12340,15289,these vertebrae are connected by several
lZm4j6Ls128,15289,17960,joints which allow you to bend twist
lZm4j6Ls128,17960,21860,carry loads and absorb shock the main
lZm4j6Ls128,21860,24259,joint is a flexible cushion between two
lZm4j6Ls128,24259,26890,vertebrae called an intervertebral disk
lZm4j6Ls128,26890,30590,the intervertebral disk is comprised of
lZm4j6Ls128,30590,33020,a soft gelatinous center surrounded by a
lZm4j6Ls128,33020,35300,tough outer wall when the gelatinous
lZm4j6Ls128,35300,37700,core pushes out through a tear in the
lZm4j6Ls128,37700,40940,fibrous wall the disc herniates adding
lZm4j6Ls128,40940,42800,pressure to the surrounding spinal
lZm4j6Ls128,42800,45860,nerves which causes pain a herniated
lZm4j6Ls128,45860,48200,disc may be caused by simple wear and
lZm4j6Ls128,48200,50360,tear from repeated movement over time or
lZm4j6Ls128,50360,54140,disc degeneration with aged spinal discs
lZm4j6Ls128,54140,56750,lose some of their water content making
lZm4j6Ls128,56750,58489,it difficult to support the load from
lZm4j6Ls128,58489,61070,the above vertebra other causes of a
lZm4j6Ls128,61070,63560,herniated disc may include long-standing
lZm4j6Ls128,63560,66710,trauma stress fractures congenital
lZm4j6Ls128,66710,69799,abnormalities while it is possible for
lZm4j6Ls128,69799,72679,an intervertebral disc to herniate at
lZm4j6Ls128,72679,74869,any level of the spine it most commonly
lZm4j6Ls128,74869,77179,occurs in the lumbar region or lower
lZm4j6Ls128,77179,80420,back symptoms include pain at the site
lZm4j6Ls128,80420,83840,of the injury pain numbness weakness or
lZm4j6Ls128,83840,86780,tingling in the arms or legs pain that
lZm4j6Ls128,86780,89600,worsens when bending twisting and or
lZm4j6Ls128,89600,91819,sitting muscle spasms
lZm4j6Ls128,91819,94429,if the herniated disc is located in the
lZm4j6Ls128,94429,97279,cervical spine or neck other symptoms
lZm4j6Ls128,97279,100459,may include loss of bladder control loss
lZm4j6Ls128,100459,103310,of coordination a heavy feeling in the
lZm4j6Ls128,103310,106640,limbs trouble balancing
lZm4j6Ls128,106640,108950,if you feel you're experiencing any of
lZm4j6Ls128,108950,110630,these symptoms you should see a
lZm4j6Ls128,110630,114230,physician for an accurate diagnosis if a
lZm4j6Ls128,114230,116060,herniated disc is established as the
lZm4j6Ls128,116060,119030,diagnosis your doctor may recommend one
lZm4j6Ls128,119030,120530,or more of the following treatments
