fH9AOUyce9Q,799,3600,hi everyone welcome back so today's
fH9AOUyce9Q,3600,5200,video is hopefully going to be a very
fH9AOUyce9Q,5200,8720,quick one um i am going to show you how
fH9AOUyce9Q,8720,11679,to genuinely create maximum style with
fH9AOUyce9Q,11679,14639,minimum amount of efforts by sharing
fH9AOUyce9Q,14639,17440,with you my own personal styling hacks
fH9AOUyce9Q,17440,21039,that i tend to do on probably 99 of my
fH9AOUyce9Q,21039,23199,clients before i go any further i just
fH9AOUyce9Q,23199,25039,wanted to say that i am listening to
fH9AOUyce9Q,25039,28080,your comments and i know that you are
fH9AOUyce9Q,28080,30240,enjoying seeing sort of how i shouldn't
fH9AOUyce9Q,30240,32960,style things up as well as how i should
fH9AOUyce9Q,32960,35600,so i am preparing for another video at
fH9AOUyce9Q,35600,37200,the moment and i'm going to continue to
fH9AOUyce9Q,37200,40399,do that for you and then to answer the
fH9AOUyce9Q,40399,42000,other question that always comes through
fH9AOUyce9Q,42000,45200,is yes i do online styling consultations
fH9AOUyce9Q,45200,47280,and it doesn't matter where you are in
fH9AOUyce9Q,47280,48640,the world
fH9AOUyce9Q,48640,51039,i had a day yesterday doing everybody in
fH9AOUyce9Q,51039,53440,america so i'm up quite late doing those
fH9AOUyce9Q,53440,55520,ones just go on to my website i'll put
fH9AOUyce9Q,55520,57840,it down below go to the services section
fH9AOUyce9Q,57840,60640,and you'll see all the details um about
fH9AOUyce9Q,60640,63199,the online consulting and obviously if
fH9AOUyce9Q,63199,64799,you're in and around the wiltshire
fH9AOUyce9Q,64799,67280,hampshire oxfordshire area then yes of
fH9AOUyce9Q,67280,69200,course i do my personal styling clients
fH9AOUyce9Q,69200,72300,as well so let's get started
fH9AOUyce9Q,72300,77200,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,77200,80400,so hack number one is the half tuck
fH9AOUyce9Q,80400,82799,you've seen this done and before on my
fH9AOUyce9Q,82799,86640,videos the aim is to lengthen your legs
fH9AOUyce9Q,86640,88560,you're looking to tuck the jumper in and
fH9AOUyce9Q,88560,90560,the several ways in which we can do that
fH9AOUyce9Q,90560,92720,i'll go through each of them now the
fH9AOUyce9Q,92720,95040,first is to tuck it into your bra this
fH9AOUyce9Q,95040,97119,only works if your jumper is long enough
fH9AOUyce9Q,97119,99600,otherwise you will show some of your
fH9AOUyce9Q,99600,101280,stomach area
fH9AOUyce9Q,101280,104399,and the reason we're doing it up here is
fH9AOUyce9Q,104399,107920,to avoid any bulk around and your mid
fH9AOUyce9Q,107920,109920,section when you tuck it in
fH9AOUyce9Q,109920,112079,try and create this curve and that will
fH9AOUyce9Q,112079,114079,really lengthen your leg look at the
fH9AOUyce9Q,114079,115759,difference here between the pictures
fH9AOUyce9Q,115759,119360,when one is tucked in and one isn't
fH9AOUyce9Q,119360,120960,and there's no reason why you can't
fH9AOUyce9Q,120960,123439,apply the same principle to the back of
fH9AOUyce9Q,123439,125840,the jumper it will stay there all day
fH9AOUyce9Q,125840,126799,long
fH9AOUyce9Q,126799,129679,and next up if that isn't for you we've
fH9AOUyce9Q,129679,132080,got the simple elastic band that we've
fH9AOUyce9Q,132080,134640,probably all got around the house
fH9AOUyce9Q,134640,137280,place the elastic band around the front
fH9AOUyce9Q,137280,140080,of the jumper like this
fH9AOUyce9Q,140080,142640,tie it up tightly and all we're going to
fH9AOUyce9Q,142640,147520,do is pop this tip of um the jumper into
fH9AOUyce9Q,147520,149680,the top of the trousers
fH9AOUyce9Q,149680,152160,instead of having to re-tuck yourself in
fH9AOUyce9Q,152160,154879,every time you go to the loo this is a
fH9AOUyce9Q,154879,157680,really simple easy way to achieve the
fH9AOUyce9Q,157680,159760,half tuck all day long
fH9AOUyce9Q,159760,161519,this jumper dress for example would
fH9AOUyce9Q,161519,165599,ordinarily be way too bulky to put in
fH9AOUyce9Q,165599,168560,the front of my trousers so i can either
fH9AOUyce9Q,168560,170560,tuck it into my bra like that which
fH9AOUyce9Q,170560,172160,works very well
fH9AOUyce9Q,172160,174720,or we can get our elastic band and we
fH9AOUyce9Q,174720,178159,can create this um pouch at the front
fH9AOUyce9Q,178159,179760,and pop that in
fH9AOUyce9Q,179760,181760,it's quite surprising that that doesn't
fH9AOUyce9Q,181760,183680,really create any extra bulk and will
fH9AOUyce9Q,183680,186319,stay in place all day long
fH9AOUyce9Q,186319,188640,and yes the same principle would also
fH9AOUyce9Q,188640,190560,work on a shirt
fH9AOUyce9Q,190560,192560,here we can see it's quite big and
fH9AOUyce9Q,192560,196720,oversized so all we do is grab our band
fH9AOUyce9Q,196720,198720,or pop it in our bra and it works
fH9AOUyce9Q,198720,201599,equally well with both options final
fH9AOUyce9Q,201599,204720,method is just to get a thin belt put it
fH9AOUyce9Q,204720,207200,around your waist and pull the jumper
fH9AOUyce9Q,207200,209360,out accordingly i always use an
fH9AOUyce9Q,209360,211840,elasticated one for this i find it's the
fH9AOUyce9Q,211840,213920,most comfortable but whichever method
fH9AOUyce9Q,213920,216000,you use out of the three given there
fH9AOUyce9Q,216000,218480,they all prevent the extra bulk and all
fH9AOUyce9Q,218480,222959,create extra leg length in the torso
fH9AOUyce9Q,223070,224720,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,224720,226959,next is a great little gadget which
fH9AOUyce9Q,226959,229280,stops your necklaces from tangling when
fH9AOUyce9Q,229280,231519,you're wearing them it's so if you're
fH9AOUyce9Q,231519,233680,like me and you like to layer up a
fH9AOUyce9Q,233680,235920,couple of necklaces at a time you can
fH9AOUyce9Q,235920,238159,buy one of these gadgets from amazon
fH9AOUyce9Q,238159,240720,they're really inexpensive and you can
fH9AOUyce9Q,240720,243360,layer with two three four even five
fH9AOUyce9Q,243360,245760,necklaces at any one time it's a
fH9AOUyce9Q,245760,247760,magnetic clasp
fH9AOUyce9Q,247760,250239,and which means that when you take the
fH9AOUyce9Q,250239,253120,necklaces off you're taking them all off
fH9AOUyce9Q,253120,256639,together so then it's very easy to
fH9AOUyce9Q,256639,258560,put them on a necklace holder or
fH9AOUyce9Q,258560,260799,something on those lines all together
fH9AOUyce9Q,260799,262720,without having to
fH9AOUyce9Q,262720,265520,untangle them or without having to
fH9AOUyce9Q,265520,268880,open up each one of the clasps and so
fH9AOUyce9Q,268880,270639,yeah something that's always in my
fH9AOUyce9Q,270639,272880,styling kit as it makes life just that
fH9AOUyce9Q,272880,276000,little bit easier
fH9AOUyce9Q,276000,278479,one thing i would say is that it is a
fH9AOUyce9Q,278479,279919,little bit difficult to get the
fH9AOUyce9Q,279919,282080,necklaces on in the first place
fH9AOUyce9Q,282080,284479,especially if you've got long nails but
fH9AOUyce9Q,284479,286960,once they are on then this will make
fH9AOUyce9Q,286960,290160,your life a lot easier if you are a
fH9AOUyce9Q,290160,294360,multiple necklace wearer
fH9AOUyce9Q,294470,297199,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,297199,299120,so next we have the sleeve tuck it
fH9AOUyce9Q,299120,301520,creates the illusion of a smaller waist
fH9AOUyce9Q,301520,304000,and is very easy to achieve as the
fH9AOUyce9Q,304000,306479,picture on the left shows the jumper as
fH9AOUyce9Q,306479,308560,it is whereas the picture on the right
fH9AOUyce9Q,308560,310880,shows where i've completed both a half
fH9AOUyce9Q,310880,314639,tuck and a sleeve tuck combined now this
fH9AOUyce9Q,314639,316479,if you just roll your sleeves up they
fH9AOUyce9Q,316479,318639,will continue to come down all day long
fH9AOUyce9Q,318639,321120,so instead get your elastic bands
fH9AOUyce9Q,321120,322560,make sure they're not too tight you
fH9AOUyce9Q,322560,325039,don't want to stop your circulation and
fH9AOUyce9Q,325039,327280,simply put them in place and roll the
fH9AOUyce9Q,327280,328880,jumper over
fH9AOUyce9Q,328880,331199,finish off with a half tuck and you've
fH9AOUyce9Q,331199,333680,instantly got a smaller waist and longer
fH9AOUyce9Q,333680,337120,legs what's not to love
fH9AOUyce9Q,337199,338960,as you can see with this coat when
fH9AOUyce9Q,338960,341120,sleeves are too long it can actually
fH9AOUyce9Q,341120,343360,make somebody look a lot bigger the coat
fH9AOUyce9Q,343360,346240,looks very overwhelming on my frame we
fH9AOUyce9Q,346240,348479,could just turn back the sleeves like
fH9AOUyce9Q,348479,351759,that but often it looks quite messy and
fH9AOUyce9Q,351759,354320,rarely does it stay up all day long
fH9AOUyce9Q,354320,356319,so instead we can just apply the same
fH9AOUyce9Q,356319,358639,principle as before and grab our elastic
fH9AOUyce9Q,358639,361120,bands and use those to
fH9AOUyce9Q,361120,363680,shorten the sleeves sorry monty wants to
fH9AOUyce9Q,363680,366800,go out in the background and this way we
fH9AOUyce9Q,366800,369039,show off the nice cuffs of the blouse
fH9AOUyce9Q,369039,371840,i'm wearing and even better on the other
fH9AOUyce9Q,371840,374400,side you can see my wrists showing if we
fH9AOUyce9Q,374400,376080,show our wrists they're the slimmest
fH9AOUyce9Q,376080,378240,part of us and it often makes the
fH9AOUyce9Q,378240,382090,overall frame look a lot slimmer
fH9AOUyce9Q,382090,387039,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,387039,390160,so next is how to tie a coat without
fH9AOUyce9Q,390160,392960,creating any extra bulk so most people
fH9AOUyce9Q,392960,394800,will just simply tie it but it doesn't
fH9AOUyce9Q,394800,396720,look overly stylish
fH9AOUyce9Q,396720,399520,some people create a bow but this just
fH9AOUyce9Q,399520,401600,adds a lot of extra bulk around the
fH9AOUyce9Q,401600,404319,front area so here's how i would do it
fH9AOUyce9Q,404319,406639,and how most stylists do it
fH9AOUyce9Q,406639,409039,so first of all i would start by
fH9AOUyce9Q,409039,411520,wrapping the belt around your hand i'm
fH9AOUyce9Q,411520,412960,going to go really slow on this because
fH9AOUyce9Q,412960,414800,it's quite hard to follow
fH9AOUyce9Q,414800,417520,pull the end through the loop from the
fH9AOUyce9Q,417520,420160,back of the hand towards the front of
fH9AOUyce9Q,420160,422000,the hand
fH9AOUyce9Q,422000,423919,once you've done this
fH9AOUyce9Q,423919,426160,stretch out your fingers to create a
fH9AOUyce9Q,426160,427280,hole
fH9AOUyce9Q,427280,429840,then grabbing the other end of the belt
fH9AOUyce9Q,429840,431840,thread the
fH9AOUyce9Q,431840,434720,belt through the hole and then pull
fH9AOUyce9Q,434720,436720,tight
fH9AOUyce9Q,436720,439120,as you pull you'll see a nice knot
fH9AOUyce9Q,439120,440960,starting to develop
fH9AOUyce9Q,440960,443840,readjust the coat into position and then
fH9AOUyce9Q,443840,446479,pull again on each side to tighten and
fH9AOUyce9Q,446479,449599,secure then voila a beautifully styled
fH9AOUyce9Q,449599,453440,knot without any bulk
fH9AOUyce9Q,455440,457120,and if that's just a little bit too much
fH9AOUyce9Q,457120,459360,of a fuss for you then an easy solution
fH9AOUyce9Q,459360,461199,is to buy a belt that makes the knot
fH9AOUyce9Q,461199,464400,creation really easy to achieve this one
fH9AOUyce9Q,464400,466639,is from amazon it comes in black and
fH9AOUyce9Q,466639,469039,brown and i think it was about 15 pounds
fH9AOUyce9Q,469039,471360,but i'll link it in the description box
fH9AOUyce9Q,471360,473599,as you can see it's got two holes it's
fH9AOUyce9Q,473599,474960,one size
fH9AOUyce9Q,474960,477680,and wrap it around your coat
fH9AOUyce9Q,477680,479840,feed the one end through both of the
fH9AOUyce9Q,479840,480800,holes
fH9AOUyce9Q,480800,483199,and then that will create a loop and
fH9AOUyce9Q,483199,486240,then feed the excess through the loop to
fH9AOUyce9Q,486240,489520,create a really nice knot shape
fH9AOUyce9Q,489520,492000,a really easy way to add a little bit of
fH9AOUyce9Q,492000,494000,extra style to your coat
fH9AOUyce9Q,494000,496000,and if you've got a belt already but
fH9AOUyce9Q,496000,497520,it's just a little bit too long and
fH9AOUyce9Q,497520,500319,there's no extra belt holes then simply
fH9AOUyce9Q,500319,502879,get the excess end
fH9AOUyce9Q,502879,504720,instead of allowing it to dangle like
fH9AOUyce9Q,504720,506800,that just feed it through create that
fH9AOUyce9Q,506800,509599,loop again tuck the end down
fH9AOUyce9Q,509599,512240,and once again you've got a nice knot
fH9AOUyce9Q,512240,514000,and it's added a little bit of extra
fH9AOUyce9Q,514000,516280,style to your coat
fH9AOUyce9Q,516280,517839,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,517839,520000,so a really easy styling trick to
fH9AOUyce9Q,520000,522240,elongate your frame and modernize your
fH9AOUyce9Q,522240,524720,wardrobe is to wear a neutral more
fH9AOUyce9Q,524720,527120,pointed shoe as opposed to a darker
fH9AOUyce9Q,527120,528959,colored round toe
fH9AOUyce9Q,528959,530800,generally speaking i'd say unless you're
fH9AOUyce9Q,530800,533279,really tall and slender then the round
fH9AOUyce9Q,533279,536240,round toe shoe will shorten your leg
fH9AOUyce9Q,536240,539600,length and more often than not date your
fH9AOUyce9Q,539600,542480,outfit i've tried to illustrate these by
fH9AOUyce9Q,542480,545040,showing and the comparison between a
fH9AOUyce9Q,545040,547760,darker and a lighter shoe and a pointed
fH9AOUyce9Q,547760,550720,versus a rounded toe and as you can see
fH9AOUyce9Q,550720,553040,here the darker shoe
fH9AOUyce9Q,553040,557040,instantly reduces my leg length and this
fH9AOUyce9Q,557040,559600,one in particular being both dark and
fH9AOUyce9Q,559600,562000,round toed is probably the most popular
fH9AOUyce9Q,562000,564320,one i see in people's wardrobes and the
fH9AOUyce9Q,564320,566800,first thing that i replace with
fH9AOUyce9Q,566800,569440,something a little bit more elegant such
fH9AOUyce9Q,569440,571279,as this shoe it doesn't have to be quite
fH9AOUyce9Q,571279,573360,as pointed and the heel doesn't have to
fH9AOUyce9Q,573360,576000,be as thin as that but a more neutral
fH9AOUyce9Q,576000,579810,pointed shoe is definitely more stylish
fH9AOUyce9Q,579810,582720,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,582720,584800,so continuing the theme of elongating
fH9AOUyce9Q,584800,587680,the frame we have a standard cardigan
fH9AOUyce9Q,587680,589839,now without doing any styling to it you
fH9AOUyce9Q,589839,592240,can see it cuts my thighs and makes them
fH9AOUyce9Q,592240,593680,even wider
fH9AOUyce9Q,593680,595839,and shortens my leg length
fH9AOUyce9Q,595839,598160,now we can do a half tuck and pull up
fH9AOUyce9Q,598160,600000,the sleeves and that will greatly
fH9AOUyce9Q,600000,601440,improve
fH9AOUyce9Q,601440,604079,the visuals on that cardigan and there
fH9AOUyce9Q,604079,606000,it looks quite nice it creates a curve
fH9AOUyce9Q,606000,607920,and elongates my frame
fH9AOUyce9Q,607920,610000,however if we compare it against a long
fH9AOUyce9Q,610000,612240,line cardigan when left without any
fH9AOUyce9Q,612240,614880,styling at all hopefully you can see the
fH9AOUyce9Q,614880,615920,difference
fH9AOUyce9Q,615920,618480,the long line produces a really um
fH9AOUyce9Q,618480,621120,leaner look a leaner silhouette and
fH9AOUyce9Q,621120,623120,modernizes the look
fH9AOUyce9Q,623120,624959,also it's very good if you're carrying
fH9AOUyce9Q,624959,627519,any excess weight as the vertical long
fH9AOUyce9Q,627519,630320,lines cut the torso in half and from a
fH9AOUyce9Q,630320,633120,side perspective it hides any excess
fH9AOUyce9Q,633120,636160,tummy weight a lot more of a modern
fH9AOUyce9Q,636160,640160,sleeker look to upgrade your wardrobe
fH9AOUyce9Q,640160,642480,and if you want to further elongate your
fH9AOUyce9Q,642480,644720,look then you can color block in the
fH9AOUyce9Q,644720,647519,middle so as you can see i'm wearing all
fH9AOUyce9Q,647519,650240,black and that's obviously going to be
fH9AOUyce9Q,650240,653360,more slimming than having black trousers
fH9AOUyce9Q,653360,655440,and a white top on but it depends on
fH9AOUyce9Q,655440,658160,your styling as to whether you like that
fH9AOUyce9Q,658160,660880,or not and personally i like putting a
fH9AOUyce9Q,660880,662480,fresh white top underneath because i
fH9AOUyce9Q,662480,664880,just think it keeps it really fresh and
fH9AOUyce9Q,664880,665910,clean
fH9AOUyce9Q,665910,674160,[Music]
fH9AOUyce9Q,674160,676640,and the final little hack is to show you
fH9AOUyce9Q,676640,680480,how to layer a jumper or a tank top over
fH9AOUyce9Q,680480,683760,a shirt without creating the extra bulk
fH9AOUyce9Q,683760,686079,so looking for a smooth line underneath
fH9AOUyce9Q,686079,689360,basically grab yourself a tank top a
fH9AOUyce9Q,689360,692000,vest of some sort and as long as it's
fH9AOUyce9Q,692000,695200,quite tight then anyone will do just
fH9AOUyce9Q,695200,696880,spend a few moments just sort of
fH9AOUyce9Q,696880,699279,smoothing everything down first of all
fH9AOUyce9Q,699279,701920,then just pop your jumper back on you
fH9AOUyce9Q,701920,704000,can even use the tank top to help you
fH9AOUyce9Q,704000,707120,start and there you go no extra lumps or
fH9AOUyce9Q,707120,709040,bumps
fH9AOUyce9Q,709040,711680,so that is it guys thank you so much for
