yCUBtGI-rng,1001,7940,"Ryder, we have a raccoon on the run.  Marshall, we're on our way.  Skye, we need eyes over the island."
yCUBtGI-rng,8074,10276,This puppy's gotta high.
yCUBtGI-rng,14513,16015,Phew!
yCUBtGI-rng,22389,27894,"Yeah, Hurricane Harrigan [INDISCERNIBLE]  Aloha. Are you friends of Marjorie and Marshall?"
yCUBtGI-rng,28027,35168,"They need [PH] cukua, help!  [PH] Cukua is on the way.  Ryder, I have a visual on Maynard."
yCUBtGI-rng,35902,39773,"Oh no, the island's volcano is erupting."
yCUBtGI-rng,47546,50250,Yikes! Maynard's in big trouble.
yCUBtGI-rng,53686,56790,"Marshall, help me with this palm tree."
yCUBtGI-rng,60093,66666,"What are they doing?  Dude, do you really think?  Yep! They're going surfing!"
yCUBtGI-rng,69068,73973,Wow! Wow!  Hang on Marshall.
yCUBtGI-rng,74107,76209,We're going to catch some air.
yCUBtGI-rng,80146,83083,Woo-hoo!  Yea-hoo!
yCUBtGI-rng,87220,92858,If we hit that log the tree will burn up.  We need some way to jump it.  What about a kick flip?
yCUBtGI-rng,92992,100100,"I haven't done one in years, but I'll give it a whirl!  Yeah!"
yCUBtGI-rng,105538,111511,"- Yeah! - They did it!  Scott, do you still see Mayor Humdinger?  Roger that."
yCUBtGI-rng,111644,118684,I can see his shiny metal pants.  Metal? That gives me an idea.  Rubble I need you and your electromagnets
yCUBtGI-rng,118818,123723,to stop a runaway mayor.  Rubble on the double.  We'll meet you at the top of the mountain.
yCUBtGI-rng,123856,125225,"Come on, Chase."
yCUBtGI-rng,129895,133333,"Ryder, Mayor Humdinger  is headed straight for a cliff."
yCUBtGI-rng,135100,139706,No problem.  Help me!
yCUBtGI-rng,143342,148181,This is going to be close.  Help!
yCUBtGI-rng,150650,152618,No!
yCUBtGI-rng,156889,162694,"Help! I'm falling. Help!  Open your eyes, Mayor, I got you."
yCUBtGI-rng,162828,167300,Huh?  Oh get me out of these things!
yCUBtGI-rng,167900,173540,"Uh oh...  Ahh!  Are you okay, Mayor Humdinger?"
yCUBtGI-rng,174340,180180,Yes.  Thanks for saving me from those horrible auto pants.  No problem.
yCUBtGI-rng,180313,185717,"Whenever your pants are out of control,  just yelp for help.  Ryder, there is one more thing."
yCUBtGI-rng,185851,188221,Can I get a lift back to the race?
yCUBtGI-rng,191790,198264,"I didn't get to finish my race, so I am back to win it.  Excuse me, Mayor Humdinger, but you tried to cheat."
yCUBtGI-rng,198397,204603,But I have learned my lesson  and I promise no cheating auto pants.  All right then.
yCUBtGI-rng,204737,209742,We have one contestant left.  Ha! That trophy is as good as mine.
yCUBtGI-rng,209876,213913,"Okay, on your marks, get set, go!"
yCUBtGI-rng,218150,223422,Ow!  Miss Marjorie!
yCUBtGI-rng,223556,229662,"Miss Marjorie,  you finished the course faster than anyone else."
yCUBtGI-rng,229962,232298,Congratulations.
yCUBtGI-rng,235701,241207,"Oh no! Little beaver, look out!  Welcome aboard!"
yCUBtGI-rng,241340,244476,"Little chompy, meet big chompy."
yCUBtGI-rng,249181,250883,"Ruff, extended!"
yCUBtGI-rng,254320,259557,"Mr Porter, are you okay in there?  I'm fine, but it kind of cramped"
yCUBtGI-rng,259691,265430,"with Daring Danny in here, too.  That's Daring Danny X, and a baby beaver."
yCUBtGI-rng,265564,269968,"Wow. Sounds crowded.  But don't worry, we'll get you all out."
yCUBtGI-rng,270736,276509,"Chase, that looks like a good spot.  Perfect! Ruff! Net!"
yCUBtGI-rng,284350,287053,Uh oh. Everybody look out!
yCUBtGI-rng,292291,297729,"Now I've seen everything.  Here, these will taste way better than me."
yCUBtGI-rng,304303,307540,Mmm! You're right.  You do build up an appetite in here.
yCUBtGI-rng,310376,312578,"Oh no, Miss Marjorie."
yCUBtGI-rng,316649,323755,"Miss Marjorie's going to slip on that banana peel.  We can't get to her in time.  We can't, but they can."
yCUBtGI-rng,323889,330797,Ruff! Megaphone!  Daring Danny X!  Gobble up Miss Marjorie!
yCUBtGI-rng,332397,336436,What!?  Do it! She'll wipe out if we don't help her.
yCUBtGI-rng,340072,341507,Apple?
yCUBtGI-rng,346245,348613,"Hey, we're not moving."
yCUBtGI-rng,353819,357490,"Okay then, how about hammer throw?"
yCUBtGI-rng,360926,366899,Uh oh.  My tongue's stuck!  Wow!
yCUBtGI-rng,370669,377376,"That was kind of fun!  Ryder, this is a disaster.  The Paw Patrol has to fix this."
yCUBtGI-rng,377510,385317,"Wee!  I know, what if we turn  Sports Day into Snow Sports Day?"
yCUBtGI-rng,385450,390623,"What do you say, Mayor Goodway?  Let the games begin again."
yCUBtGI-rng,393125,398598,"Welcome back everyone, back to the new  improved sports day."
yCUBtGI-rng,404270,413079,"Skye shows us there are more thn one way to get past a hurdle.  And the long jump is now a long, long slide."
yCUBtGI-rng,415581,422955,Woo-hoo! All right! Go pups!  The pups are really relaying belly style.
yCUBtGI-rng,423555,429261,"The baton!  And for our surprise main event, Rubble and Everest"
yCUBtGI-rng,429395,431897,are tearing up the half pipe!
yCUBtGI-rng,441406,445945,A triple double flip?  I gotta try that.
yCUBtGI-rng,446412,452184,We'll move Everest. You rule!  Sports day is the best time ever.
yCUBtGI-rng,452318,457289,"You pups rule!  Actually, Daring Danny X rules."
yCUBtGI-rng,457723,463129,Daring Danny rides again!  Wow!
yCUBtGI-rng,468634,473206,"Sounds like somebody is out there.  I got a signal that, but how?"
yCUBtGI-rng,474073,480780,"I know.  Preparing to raise the pup [PH] tag,  Ruff, ruff! Aqua drone!"
yCUBtGI-rng,488754,496929,"There it is! Awesome job, Zuma.  Hold on, my super sonar's picking up a sound"
yCUBtGI-rng,498530,501567,from the castle wall?
yCUBtGI-rng,504569,510709,"Go ahead, Zuma.  I think someone is sending a signal  from the casual basement.  You think it might be Chase?"
yCUBtGI-rng,510843,517015,"We'd better check it out.  Rocky, you and Marshall come with me.  Skye, Zuma and Rubble, head back"
yCUBtGI-rng,517149,522220,to the Mission Cruiser and wait to hear from us.  [dogs barking]
yCUBtGI-rng,525223,531130,"Rocky, use your radar scanner to see who's making that noise.  Ruff! Radar scanner!"
yCUBtGI-rng,539137,544009,It's Chase!  He's right on the other side of that wall.  How do we get him out?
yCUBtGI-rng,544142,549649,"I have an idea.  Rubble, we found Chase.  We need your mini miner."
yCUBtGI-rng,549982,552718,Rubble on the double!
yCUBtGI-rng,558824,564329,"Don't worry, Chase.  Rubble's on the case.  I just hope someone hears me."
yCUBtGI-rng,572738,579011,Wow!  Woo-hoo!  Chase!  You're safe.
yCUBtGI-rng,579644,581279,Chase!
yCUBtGI-rng,584683,586018,All set.
yCUBtGI-rng,593191,599898,"Hang on, Mayor!  This pup's gotta fly!"
yCUBtGI-rng,600332,606238,"Thanks, Skye!  Hi, Mayor Goodway.  Oh Ryder, thank you.  Okay, pups."
yCUBtGI-rng,606372,608374,We're coming in for a landing at the soccer field.
yCUBtGI-rng,613745,619151,"Grab a rope and pull.  Ruff, ruff!  Ruff, ruff!"
yCUBtGI-rng,620986,627026,"Please get us down safely.  Please, Please, Please.  Mayor Goodway, we're safe on the ground."
yCUBtGI-rng,628427,631797,"Oh, right.  Chickaletta, we're safe!"
yCUBtGI-rng,635600,641072,"Now get back to the race, pups!  It's not over yet.  You better hurry, pups."
yCUBtGI-rng,641206,643675,Alex is headed for the finish line.
yCUBtGI-rng,670502,672038,Tight race.
yCUBtGI-rng,677176,683115,Wow!  Who won? Who won?  I took a finish line photo. Look.
yCUBtGI-rng,683482,690756,And the winner is Alex!  I did it!  I really won!
yCUBtGI-rng,690889,696561,"Way to go, Alex!  Oh no Ryder! Mayor Goodway is rolling right toward a cliff."
yCUBtGI-rng,696695,702768,"We can't stop it, but we can make sure it lands safely.  - Ready, Chase? - I sure am."
yCUBtGI-rng,702901,709875,Ruff! Net!  Oh!
yCUBtGI-rng,713178,715881,"Hold on tight, Chickaletta."
yCUBtGI-rng,719050,724156,"That was kind of fun, wasn't it?  My little Chickaletta.  Hang on, Mayor. I'll get you out."
yCUBtGI-rng,724289,728326,Sorry!  I can't control this thing.
yCUBtGI-rng,731129,738803,"Ryder, good news.  It looks like the globe is slowing down  from rolling over the sand dunes.  That's great, Skye. We'll be right there."
yCUBtGI-rng,742141,747545,Finally.  I've felt like a hamster  trapped in an exercise wheel.
yCUBtGI-rng,748681,754286,"We'll have you out of there in a jiffy, Mayor Goodway.  Skye, use your hook to grab the globe."
yCUBtGI-rng,754419,759858,Roger that.  Got it!
yCUBtGI-rng,759992,763162,"Thanks for the lift!  Oh no, not again!"
yCUBtGI-rng,765731,769935,"Slow down, Mayor Goodway.  I'm trying."
yCUBtGI-rng,771736,779678,Oh no!  Now we go again.  We're going to need all paws on deck to stop that globe.
yCUBtGI-rng,779812,781347,"We're on our way, Ryder."
yCUBtGI-rng,788053,794860,"Time for your best soccer moves, everyone.  We have to keep Mayor Goodway safe  and stop her from going into more trouble."
yCUBtGI-rng,796094,801399,"Come on, let's go.  Rubble, use your scoop to build a hill over there."
yCUBtGI-rng,801766,808240,"Rubble on the double.  Marshall, your ball!"
yCUBtGI-rng,808374,813078,Oh! Easy pups!  I'm open.
yCUBtGI-rng,820085,826291,"We did it!  Oh no! Ryder, the kittens went off the course."
yCUBtGI-rng,826424,830095,"They're heading to the cliff edge.  On it, Skye."
yCUBtGI-rng,833966,839805,"Rubble, Everest, Chase.  Ryder!  The kittens went past the safety cones"
yCUBtGI-rng,839938,844843,towards the cliff.  They need help. I'm on the way.  We're on it.
yCUBtGI-rng,844976,852584,"Follow the cones Alex!  You're almost to the finish line.  Okay, I can do it. I think."
yCUBtGI-rng,852717,857456,Thanks Paw Patrol!  Ah!
yCUBtGI-rng,861693,866932,"There they are!  Hang on, kittens. We'll get you."
yCUBtGI-rng,867065,871470,Careful. They're way too close to the edge.  It might not hold.
yCUBtGI-rng,880812,886018,"Hey, I can see the finish line.  I'm gonna make it!  Hurray!"
yCUBtGI-rng,888753,894226,"Don't worry, we'll pull you up.  Everest, I need you to use your grappling hook  to lower me down to the kitties"
yCUBtGI-rng,894359,900132,"and your snowboard jet to pull me back up.  On it, Ryder!  Ruff! Snowboard!"
yCUBtGI-rng,901032,903068,"Ruff, ruff!"
yCUBtGI-rng,906738,908641,Ruff! Grappling hook!
yCUBtGI-rng,914513,919285,"Lower me down.  When I give the word, pull us up.  Got it!"
yCUBtGI-rng,920752,927425,"A little more. There!  Meow!  Okay, Everest, Pull us up."
yCUBtGI-rng,927559,929328,Let's jet!
yCUBtGI-rng,933698,939371,"Hurray! All right.  Ruff, ruff!  You kittens are lucky Everest sent"
yCUBtGI-rng,939504,942074,the rest of the Paw Patrol were around for this race.
yCUBtGI-rng,946945,952217,Goal!  Hairballs! Tied again.
yCUBtGI-rng,953218,954987,You know what to do.
yCUBtGI-rng,958957,961360,"- Ruff, ruff! - Meow!"
yCUBtGI-rng,965363,971003,"Oh no, what happened!  Now that's not how to inflate a ball, you silly kitten."
yCUBtGI-rng,971136,973404,"Luckily, I have another one."
yCUBtGI-rng,979778,984383,"Left, right, zig, zag.  - Gotcha! - Hey!"
yCUBtGI-rng,988787,991623,Ouch! My paw. Again!
yCUBtGI-rng,997162,1002334,Yikes! This remote shocked me.  Uh oh!
yCUBtGI-rng,1005370,1012177,"Skye, I need your wings to get up and grab that cat.  Marshall, X ray the ball and see what makes it fly."
yCUBtGI-rng,1013244,1016081,"Okay, Marshall.  Buckle up!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1021720,1025657,Okay. Just go slow and don't go too fast.
yCUBtGI-rng,1030428,1037501,"Ruff, ruff! X ray screen!  It's electronic.  It's a remote controlled soccer ball."
yCUBtGI-rng,1037635,1043475,"Marshall grab the kitten and Rocket  kick that ball into the bay.  You got it, Ryder."
yCUBtGI-rng,1045009,1050849,"One, two, three!  Woops!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1050982,1052217,Oh no!
yCUBtGI-rng,1057088,1060392,"Sit still, kitty!  I wouldn't want to lose a passenger."
yCUBtGI-rng,1063829,1067332,"Oh come on wind, a little help please?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1069067,1075741,Uh oh!  That thing is way out of control.  Yikes!
yCUBtGI-rng,1076174,1081213,"It's Mayor Humdinger all right.  Skye, lift them off.  Roger, Ryder!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1084716,1091423,Put the harness on Mayor Humdinger!  I'll lift you all off.  The kitties and I are winning this race.
yCUBtGI-rng,1091556,1098330,"Ryder, he won't let me save him!  Then we'll just have to rescue him another way.  Zuma, go underwater and get to that fin"
yCUBtGI-rng,1098463,1103769,"without Humdinger seeing you. Then shut it down.  Totally! Ruff, sub!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1111309,1117882,Winning's simple  when you're the only racer.  I just have to get by...
yCUBtGI-rng,1118016,1123088,Seal Island!?  No!  We're going to crash right into it!
yCUBtGI-rng,1123488,1127559,"Stop this thing, kitties!  Shut it off!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1130295,1135800,"I'm right underneath the fin, Ryder.  Good, use your claw to grab it and hold it steady, Zuma."
yCUBtGI-rng,1135933,1141907,"Ruff, ruff! Claw!  Got it, Ryder."
yCUBtGI-rng,1142574,1148847,Wow!  But I don't know for how long.  This fin is super strong.
yCUBtGI-rng,1149781,1156154,Phew!  Sort of. Drat!  We're still headed right for the island.
yCUBtGI-rng,1156288,1161158,"I can't look.  Ryder, there's a button on the fin"
yCUBtGI-rng,1161293,1166865,"that's got to turn it off.  Go for it, Zuma.  I'm on it. Ruff! Hook!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1174005,1180211,"Ahoy there, Mayor Humdinger.  Oh, hello."
yCUBtGI-rng,1181946,1187752,"Great job, Zuma.  Marshall, you want to play?  What? Me?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1187885,1192824,"We need you.  Otherwise, We don't have enough players.  Ryder?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1192958,1197896,"You know, I'm kind of clumsy with the ball.  But we want you to play Marshall."
yCUBtGI-rng,1198030,1204102,"Yeah, it doesn't matter how good you are.  You are a part of the team.  No game is too big."
yCUBtGI-rng,1204236,1211309,No pup is too small.  Marshall! Marshall!  Marshall! Marshall!
yCUBtGI-rng,1211442,1215680,Okay. I'll try.  Woo-hoo! Yay!
yCUBtGI-rng,1222854,1224456,I got it!
yCUBtGI-rng,1230395,1232231,"You'll get it next time, Marshall."
yCUBtGI-rng,1239136,1240739,"Oh, double drats!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1250481,1253618,Ah-ha! Go Boomers!
yCUBtGI-rng,1258890,1266365,Marshall.  Wow!  Wow!
yCUBtGI-rng,1275840,1280479,"Look, I made a basket with myself.  Ruff!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1284682,1288353,"Great move, Marshall.  You won the game."
yCUBtGI-rng,1292257,1297796,Lost to a pack of pups.  What a team!
yCUBtGI-rng,1297929,1300766,If you ever need some all stars just yelp for help.
yCUBtGI-rng,1313277,1319584,"I have him in my sights, Ryder.  He is riding the Kitty Mobile  and taking a short cut.  Good work, Skye!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1321720,1328493,Looks like I'm the fastest mayor of them all!  Wow! Log!
yCUBtGI-rng,1328960,1334933,"Ah!  Oh no!  Ryder, Mayor Humdinger needs help."
yCUBtGI-rng,1335066,1337836,"We're on our way. Chase, Come on."
yCUBtGI-rng,1342173,1347311,Now I'll never win.  Hold tight Mayor Humdinger.
yCUBtGI-rng,1347445,1352718,"The Paw Patrol is here.  Chase, I need your winch line.  Ruff! Winch!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1356188,1358824,Grab on and we'll bring you up safely.
yCUBtGI-rng,1361759,1367733,Get me off this cliff!  Ruff! Winch line.  Retract.
yCUBtGI-rng,1368400,1373871,But what if I fall?  That was a close call.
yCUBtGI-rng,1374005,1381544,"Yes. Well, I suppose I must thank you  and the pups for rescuing me.  Don't mention it. Just remember, cheaters never win."
yCUBtGI-rng,1381679,1386051,"Now, come on, pups.  Let's go see Mayor Goodway cross the finish line."
yCUBtGI-rng,1395026,1402466,Way to go!  Hurray!  Drat it all!  I did it!  I finished the mayor's race.
yCUBtGI-rng,1402600,1408740,"And with Mayor Humdinger disqualify  you won the mayor's race.  Did you hear that, Chickaletta?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1410175,1412677,Don't you want your puppy?
yCUBtGI-rng,1416715,1422553,They're headed for the gorge.  They'll fall right in!  That's why we got to stop them before they get there.
yCUBtGI-rng,1422687,1428460,Ready Wildcat?  Let's try another upgrade.  Rawr! Super Boosters!
yCUBtGI-rng,1433298,1438268,"Hey, put on the breaks!  You're headed for a nasty fall!  Gorge!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1438402,1444109,Abandon Ferris wheel!  You're going to believe some kitty over me?
yCUBtGI-rng,1445910,1454786,"To get up there, I'm going to have to land  the triple alley [INDISCERNIBLE] blue.  I hope I can do it this time, but I have to, to save that pup."
yCUBtGI-rng,1461225,1466931,"One, two, three.  I did it!  Awesome move Wildcat."
yCUBtGI-rng,1467064,1471603,Now see if you can clog his gears with the yarn.  I got this.
yCUBtGI-rng,1473505,1475774,Rawr! Yarnball launcher!
yCUBtGI-rng,1494258,1500565,"Awesome move, Wildcat. I knew you can make that jump.  - Great job. - Nice one, Wildcat."
yCUBtGI-rng,1500999,1507372,No silly cat toy's gonna stop this pup.  Oops! Help!
yCUBtGI-rng,1507505,1509074,Ruff! Net!
yCUBtGI-rng,1517181,1523387,"Wow!  Close one.  All right, Mayor. Ready to win this race?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1523521,1528527,The race? I almost forgot.  - Are you in? - In it to win it!
yCUBtGI-rng,1534565,1539838,Easiest race yet.  Looks like another year on top for the town of Foggy Bottom.
yCUBtGI-rng,1541105,1547178,What is it?  What? How did you get there?  This race is on Mayor Humdinger.
yCUBtGI-rng,1547444,1552049,Don't worry. We'll wait for you at the finish line.
yCUBtGI-rng,1552784,1557923,"I've never lost a race, and I'm not starting now.  After them!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1559857,1565697,"There's Jake's Mountain.  And the finish line is on the other side.  The winds are stronger up higher,"
yCUBtGI-rng,1565830,1570936,"and we'd have a better chance of winning.  What do you say?  Up, up and away!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1572003,1576074,Woo-hoo!  They're beating us! Higher! Higher!
yCUBtGI-rng,1581646,1585917,Woo-hoo!  Full steam ahead!
yCUBtGI-rng,1587285,1595593,"There's the finish line.  Here they come!  Go adventure bay!  - Hey, Jake! - Yo, cool!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1595726,1599931,I have to prepare a victory speech?  I hope you get to use it.
yCUBtGI-rng,1601866,1606904,How did Humdinger get ahead of us?  We're going to have to drop fast to get to the finish line first.
yCUBtGI-rng,1607038,1612010,"- Are you ready, Mayor? - In it to win it!  Woo-hoo!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1615412,1619684,Ha-ha-ha! Winning!  What!?
yCUBtGI-rng,1621052,1626724,"Hurray!  You should get down.  Don't be silly, I must go."
yCUBtGI-rng,1626858,1632697,I laugh at the rain.  Ha! That is me laughing at the rain.
yCUBtGI-rng,1639203,1646577,"Yes, I'm officially worried now.  Ruff, ruff, ruff!"
yCUBtGI-rng,1646711,1651816,"You're just in time.  Park under Francois and raise the crane.  I'm here, Ryder."
yCUBtGI-rng,1651949,1657021,"Ruff, crane!  We'll get you down, Francois. Just hang on."
yCUBtGI-rng,1657455,1661059,"Hang on. Yes, that is an excellent idea."
yCUBtGI-rng,1667966,1673204,"Rubble, hurry!  Almost got you.  Can you be closer than almost?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1673804,1679844,Too late.  Gotcha!
yCUBtGI-rng,1680945,1685982,"Woo-hoo! Yeah!  Nice grab, Rubble!  Thanks, Ryder."
yCUBtGI-rng,1686384,1691356,"You and the pups really saved the day?  Whenever there's a problem, just yelp for help."
yCUBtGI-rng,1694425,1696795,Feast your eyes on this!
yCUBtGI-rng,1699530,1706104,"Ha! It's magnificent, no?  I mean..."
yCUBtGI-rng,1709440,1715580,"Ruff, ruff! Buoy!  Phew! I'm sure glad I was here, dude."
yCUBtGI-rng,1715713,1721119,What a good pup.  They're all good pups.  Hurray!
yCUBtGI-rng,1721252,1726323,"I am amazing  if I do say so myself.  Not this time, Francois."
yCUBtGI-rng,1726457,1729494,Everyone saluting Zuma's sensational save.
yCUBtGI-rng,1731596,1739137,"Okay, Everest.  This is about as close as we can get  without the eagle spotting us.  I sure hope that ball's in her nest."
yCUBtGI-rng,1740438,1747912,"Okay, Skye, time to make that eagle  look at you instead of Everest.  Okay, I love playing air tag"
yCUBtGI-rng,1748045,1753985,with the big bird with big beak.  It's just going to take some big bravery.
yCUBtGI-rng,1757788,1762593,"Come on, eagle!  Try and catch me."
yCUBtGI-rng,1763127,1765130,But don't try too hard.
yCUBtGI-rng,1768533,1772036,Everest. Your turn.  Ruff! Grappling hook.
yCUBtGI-rng,1777308,1783348,"Everest is on her way up the mountain.  Skye, keep that eagle busy. Right and easy  Right, busy."
yCUBtGI-rng,1783481,1789354,And dizzy.  Almost there.
yCUBtGI-rng,1789854,1796060,"I made it.  Ryder, Skye."
yCUBtGI-rng,1796193,1801832,"I found the ball.  The eagle mom must have taken it for her babies to play with.  Great job, Everest."
yCUBtGI-rng,1801966,1808172,Now let's get back to the game.  And hurry.  But we can't leave these baby birds
yCUBtGI-rng,1808305,1814545,"- without a toy. - You're right.  Skye, do you have anything  in your copter they could use for a baby eagle toy?"
yCUBtGI-rng,1814678,1819917,"Actually, I always take Mr Squeekums with me.  I'll miss him,"
yCUBtGI-rng,1820051,1825022,but the monkey's need their new big talk.  And these baby eagles need a toy to play with.
yCUBtGI-rng,1825155,1830995,"Thanks for taking one for the team, Skye.  Everest, we're okay to put the ball back in play."
yCUBtGI-rng,1834465,1839403,Got it!  Don't worry a new toy is on its way.
yCUBtGI-rng,1839536,1842040,Incoming mousy!
