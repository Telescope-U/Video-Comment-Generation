OuOkS2tm89k,0,2050,"- What's up GQ, I'm Stephen Curry,"
OuOkS2tm89k,2050,5130,and today I'm going undercover on the internet.
OuOkS2tm89k,5130,6183,It's actually me.
OuOkS2tm89k,8380,9313,Instagram.
OuOkS2tm89k,11400,13740,"Honestly, who's a better shooter, you or Klay?"
OuOkS2tm89k,13740,16340,"I'm glad I'm sitting in this seat right now and not him,"
OuOkS2tm89k,16340,18020,'cause I get to answer and not him.
OuOkS2tm89k,18020,19070,And it's definitely me.
OuOkS2tm89k,19070,21130,But every great shooter feels like they can beat
OuOkS2tm89k,21130,22699,whoever the next best shooter is.
OuOkS2tm89k,22700,24610,"But the fact that he shoots the ball so well,"
OuOkS2tm89k,24610,27180,I gotta be on my A-game to beat him no matter when it is.
OuOkS2tm89k,27180,30514,"Be honest, who played the best defense against you?"
OuOkS2tm89k,30514,31630,Oh that's a great question.
OuOkS2tm89k,31630,34270,"Honestly, my brother, because he knows my game so well,"
OuOkS2tm89k,34270,37390,and there's always that kind of vibe of him disarming me
OuOkS2tm89k,37390,38950,"when I'm out there, 'cause I feel like,"
OuOkS2tm89k,38950,40830,"I'm so proud to see my brother out there on the court,"
OuOkS2tm89k,40830,42680,I kind of get lost in that moment.
OuOkS2tm89k,42680,43920,"But outside of Seth,"
OuOkS2tm89k,43920,47160,I'd probably say Tony Allen or Avery Bradley.
OuOkS2tm89k,47160,48020,Posted.
OuOkS2tm89k,48020,49530,"I gotta ask, fully healthy,"
OuOkS2tm89k,49530,52340,do you believe the Warriors with KD could have beat
OuOkS2tm89k,52340,55300,the 96 Bulls in a seven game finals?
OuOkS2tm89k,55300,56260,Absolutely.
OuOkS2tm89k,56260,57710,"Obviously we'll never know,"
OuOkS2tm89k,57710,60899,"but you put us on paper with them, I like our chances."
OuOkS2tm89k,60900,63040,I'd say dubs in six too.
OuOkS2tm89k,63040,64040,Let's check Twitter.
OuOkS2tm89k,65840,67219,I wonder if Steph's ankle injuries
OuOkS2tm89k,67220,68760,ever affected him mentally?
OuOkS2tm89k,68760,70090,Like did he ever lose faith?
OuOkS2tm89k,70090,72130,There were plenty of times that I doubted myself.
OuOkS2tm89k,72130,74250,"All I wanted to do was just be healthy and play,"
OuOkS2tm89k,74250,76850,and then worry about being great on the court later.
OuOkS2tm89k,76850,78439,"But when you're in those moments,"
OuOkS2tm89k,78440,80430,"doing rehab, it becomes really monotonous."
OuOkS2tm89k,80430,81263,It is hard and you gotta
OuOkS2tm89k,81263,84240,"have a good support system around you, and thankfully I did."
OuOkS2tm89k,85240,88650,"Who would win a three throw shootout, Seth or Steph Curry?"
OuOkS2tm89k,88650,91450,"I don't even have to, it's not a long answer, it's me."
OuOkS2tm89k,91450,93229,Big brother always gonna win.
OuOkS2tm89k,93230,95550,Is Steph Curry even a point guard?
OuOkS2tm89k,95550,98110,How can you be a point guard when you play off the ball more
OuOkS2tm89k,98110,99160,than on the ball?
OuOkS2tm89k,99160,100160,How are you a point guard
OuOkS2tm89k,100160,101810,when your power forward facilitates
OuOkS2tm89k,101810,103961,the offense more than you?
OuOkS2tm89k,103961,104794,"Steph Curry is a shooting guard,"
OuOkS2tm89k,104794,106880,and he's not the main ball handler for his team.
OuOkS2tm89k,106880,109250,"I would have to say you're right,"
OuOkS2tm89k,109250,110320,"and you have a lot of questions,"
OuOkS2tm89k,110320,113050,"but, it doesn't really matter what position you play."
OuOkS2tm89k,113050,114370,"It's just, can you play basketball?"
OuOkS2tm89k,114370,115390,"And we just figure it out,"
OuOkS2tm89k,115390,117300,so you're going to call Draymond the point guard
OuOkS2tm89k,117300,119550,"and me the shooting guard, sounds great."
OuOkS2tm89k,119550,120843,Now on to Quora.
OuOkS2tm89k,121928,124930,How can Stephen Curry be stopped?
OuOkS2tm89k,124930,127270,"What did Bron say that one time, you don't."
OuOkS2tm89k,127270,129099,"I like that line, I had to steal it from him."
OuOkS2tm89k,129100,130119,I like that one.
OuOkS2tm89k,130119,131790,How could I shoot like Curry?
OuOkS2tm89k,131790,135590,"Everybody thinks they can shoot from 20, 30, 40 feet."
OuOkS2tm89k,135590,137290,I've been developing muscle memory
OuOkS2tm89k,137290,139019,since I was basically five years old
OuOkS2tm89k,139020,140570,when I started playing organized basketball.
OuOkS2tm89k,140570,143950,"So, you gotta put in the hours, but it only comes with reps."
OuOkS2tm89k,143950,145959,"However many shots I've taken since I was five,"
OuOkS2tm89k,145960,147560,you got to shoot that many shots.
OuOkS2tm89k,147560,150510,"Who do you take, prime Iverson or Steph Curry?"
OuOkS2tm89k,150510,152150,That is a great question.
OuOkS2tm89k,152150,154510,Everybody remembers that time I tried cornrows.
OuOkS2tm89k,154510,155774,I would take prime Iverson cornrows
OuOkS2tm89k,155774,158390,over prime Steph cornrows first and foremost.
OuOkS2tm89k,158390,161828,"But on the court, I modeled a lot of the ball handling"
OuOkS2tm89k,161828,165045,"after what AI did, but still gotta bet on myself,"
OuOkS2tm89k,165045,167430,without the cornrows.
OuOkS2tm89k,167430,170530,Why don't the referee's call traveling on Steph Curry?
OuOkS2tm89k,170530,171930,They were probably like three things
OuOkS2tm89k,171930,174719,"that NBA players never do: we never travel,"
OuOkS2tm89k,174720,176130,"we've never fouled anybody,"
OuOkS2tm89k,176130,177590,and we never want to come out of the game.
OuOkS2tm89k,177590,179530,"So, you have to kind of abide by those"
OuOkS2tm89k,179530,181110,if you want to play in the NBA.
OuOkS2tm89k,181110,181963,Tik Tok.
OuOkS2tm89k,183180,185859,What does Curry do in the halftime with his teammates?
OuOkS2tm89k,185860,188020,"If we're winning, we're telling jokes,"
OuOkS2tm89k,188020,191130,"we're motivating each other, we're having a good time."
OuOkS2tm89k,191130,193620,"If we're losing, most likely somebody is getting yelled"
OuOkS2tm89k,193620,196590,"at by Draymond, and we're trying to figure it out"
OuOkS2tm89k,196590,198099,so we can turn it around in the second half.
OuOkS2tm89k,198100,200220,"But sometimes I do check my Twitter too,"
OuOkS2tm89k,200220,202140,see all the hate or the praise coming in.
OuOkS2tm89k,202140,203780,Just depends on how the games going.
OuOkS2tm89k,203780,205780,Let's see more on Instagram.
OuOkS2tm89k,205780,207069,"Before you got drafted,"
OuOkS2tm89k,207070,209860,was there a team you were looking forward to going to?
OuOkS2tm89k,209860,211940,I absolutely was wanting to go to the Knicks.
OuOkS2tm89k,211940,214530,"The draft was in New York, it was my dad's birthday,"
OuOkS2tm89k,214530,216580,"June 25th, 2009."
OuOkS2tm89k,216580,219020,I had a lot of conversations with the GM of the New York
OuOkS2tm89k,219020,220520,"at the time who said if I was on the board,"
OuOkS2tm89k,220520,221353,they'd picked me.
OuOkS2tm89k,221353,223105,"So there's a lot of hype because being in New York,"
OuOkS2tm89k,223105,224760,I thought I was going to be a New York Knick.
OuOkS2tm89k,224760,226530,"But they always say careful what you wish for,"
OuOkS2tm89k,226530,228050,"everything happened the way it was supposed to be,"
OuOkS2tm89k,228050,229190,so I'm a Warrior.
OuOkS2tm89k,229190,231790,Who is really the best chef Curry in the kitchen?
OuOkS2tm89k,231790,233948,"So, I learned a lesson from my wife"
OuOkS2tm89k,233949,236070,that chef Curry is not my nickname.
OuOkS2tm89k,236070,237410,"I know a lot of the fans use it,"
OuOkS2tm89k,237410,239340,but she has called dibs on that.
OuOkS2tm89k,239340,242330,She is the real chef Curry with the pot.
OuOkS2tm89k,242330,243633,Reddit.
OuOkS2tm89k,243633,248310,"After tonight's games, Steph Curry, 27.6 points per game,"
OuOkS2tm89k,248310,251090,"and Kevin Durant, 29.5 points per game,"
OuOkS2tm89k,251090,253510,"are currently second and first in scoring,"
OuOkS2tm89k,253510,255140,both on insane efficiency.
OuOkS2tm89k,255140,257001,Is it fair to consider them on their own tier
OuOkS2tm89k,257001,260030,apart from the rest of the league as scorers right now?
OuOkS2tm89k,260030,262620,I've always admired the way KD gets it done.
OuOkS2tm89k,262620,264820,"Obviously, playing against him for many years"
OuOkS2tm89k,264820,266410,"and being his teammate for three years,"
OuOkS2tm89k,266410,269230,he is the most gifted scorer in terms of being able
OuOkS2tm89k,269230,270280,to get a shot off.
OuOkS2tm89k,270280,272272,But when it comes to just overall skill
OuOkS2tm89k,272272,274660,"and the way that I try to get it done at 6'3,"
OuOkS2tm89k,274660,276960,if I'm in that comparison at the top of the league
OuOkS2tm89k,276960,279050,"in terms of scoring, then I'm doing something right."
OuOkS2tm89k,279050,281210,Is Stephen Curry the only top 15 player
OuOkS2tm89k,281210,282932,of all time under 6'3?
OuOkS2tm89k,285016,286900,"I think, who is 6?"
OuOkS2tm89k,286900,288400,I got Isaiah Thomas.
OuOkS2tm89k,288400,291320,"I don't do the rankings, but if you give me the 6'3"
OuOkS2tm89k,291320,293270,and under crown I'll take it.
OuOkS2tm89k,293270,294703,I would definitely take it.
OuOkS2tm89k,295670,299140,Sheez Steph with no mercy on the fans too.
OuOkS2tm89k,299140,300990,Did Steph take the kids shoes?
OuOkS2tm89k,300990,302610,That would truly be no mercy.
OuOkS2tm89k,302610,303680,Let him keep his shoes.
OuOkS2tm89k,303680,306970,"But the kid asked for a fair competition,"
OuOkS2tm89k,306970,308130,and I beat him fair and square.
OuOkS2tm89k,308130,311410,So I had to sign the poster to make sure he had a souvenir
OuOkS2tm89k,311410,314210,"from me, the Battle Royale and rock paper scissors."
OuOkS2tm89k,314210,316180,"But I had to make sure I wrote ""I won"" on the top,"
OuOkS2tm89k,316180,317013,so he remembered.
OuOkS2tm89k,317013,317950,Maybe to motivate him
OuOkS2tm89k,317950,319740,and he'll have a story to tell one day.
OuOkS2tm89k,319740,321000,More Quora.
OuOkS2tm89k,321000,323620,Why can't Steph Curry dunk?
OuOkS2tm89k,323620,325560,Can't be good at everything big fella.
OuOkS2tm89k,325560,328110,Why does Steph Curry get skipped by seven teams
OuOkS2tm89k,328110,329430,in the NBA draft?
OuOkS2tm89k,329430,331169,I was asking that same question when I was sitting
OuOkS2tm89k,331170,334020,"in the green room, but I've always been a late bloomer too."
OuOkS2tm89k,334020,337370,So maybe I didn't pass the eye test in terms
OuOkS2tm89k,337370,339580,of being able to play on this level physically.
OuOkS2tm89k,339580,342360,"But again, the right team picked me at the right spot"
OuOkS2tm89k,342360,344319,and the rest is history.
OuOkS2tm89k,344320,347158,Will Steph Curry ever win another title?
OuOkS2tm89k,347158,348509,Absolutely.
OuOkS2tm89k,348510,349630,Back to Twitter.
OuOkS2tm89k,349630,350950,Seth MacFarlane?
OuOkS2tm89k,350950,352060,Steph Curry?
OuOkS2tm89k,352060,353240,Good Times reboot?
OuOkS2tm89k,353240,354073,Huh?
OuOkS2tm89k,354073,355820,"I asked myself the same questions, but we doing it."
OuOkS2tm89k,355820,358490,We wanted to bring the Good Times show back
OuOkS2tm89k,358490,359740,"and bring some of the hilarity,"
OuOkS2tm89k,359740,362560,some of the good conversations and animate it.
OuOkS2tm89k,362560,365414,So who better to work with and Seth MacFarlane?
OuOkS2tm89k,365414,366270,Hold it.
OuOkS2tm89k,366270,367633,Steph Curry has an actual.
OuOkS2tm89k,369050,371099,Steph Curry has an actual vision problem?
OuOkS2tm89k,371100,373490,And shoots lights out like he does with contacts?
OuOkS2tm89k,373490,375740,The reason I found out I couldn't see very well
OuOkS2tm89k,375740,379150,is because our GM Bob Meyers saw me on TV one time
OuOkS2tm89k,379150,380979,"just squinting, looking at the scoreboard."
OuOkS2tm89k,380980,382090,"And he came up and asked me, he's like,"
OuOkS2tm89k,382090,383010,can you actually see?
OuOkS2tm89k,383010,385890,"And I was like, no, I just see the color orange really well."
OuOkS2tm89k,385890,387893,And usually from about 25 feet.
OuOkS2tm89k,389382,391810,"StephenCurry30, just wanted to ask,"
OuOkS2tm89k,391810,394039,when did you first start out playing golf?
OuOkS2tm89k,394039,397370,I'm getting my girls ages 11 and 9 into beginner lessons
OuOkS2tm89k,397370,400080,and I'm hoping I can get into it also at my age.
OuOkS2tm89k,400080,402349,It is never too late to start playing golf.
OuOkS2tm89k,402350,404830,It is one of the great pastimes that no matter
OuOkS2tm89k,404830,406220,"when you start, you can hopefully play"
OuOkS2tm89k,406220,407160,for the rest of your life.
OuOkS2tm89k,407160,408330,And the fact that you're getting your girls
OuOkS2tm89k,408330,409569,"into it is unbelievable,"
OuOkS2tm89k,409570,411810,"because I started at the same age, right at 10,"
OuOkS2tm89k,411810,414740,and took my first lesson and fell in love with it.
OuOkS2tm89k,414740,417320,"It's my hobby, but it's more of a passion."
OuOkS2tm89k,417321,419899,What are they talking about?
OuOkS2tm89k,419899,423370,The fact that I could get Michael Jordan on a golf course
OuOkS2tm89k,423370,424979,to talk about the Ryder Cup.
OuOkS2tm89k,424980,427740,It's probably one of the biggest accomplishments of my life.
OuOkS2tm89k,427740,429367,It's a lot of crossover between golf and basketball
OuOkS2tm89k,429367,431130,in terms of the competitive fire
OuOkS2tm89k,431130,432690,and the pursuit of perfection.
OuOkS2tm89k,432690,435570,So we had a lot of things to cover on that one.
OuOkS2tm89k,435570,436720,Who's the best Curry?
OuOkS2tm89k,436720,438560,"Dell, Seth or Steph?"
OuOkS2tm89k,438560,440190,I'm assuming we're talking basketball.
OuOkS2tm89k,440190,442250,"And if we are, we're talking about me."
OuOkS2tm89k,442250,443970,"But my dad always says,"
OuOkS2tm89k,443970,445620,you're only as good as your last game.
OuOkS2tm89k,445620,448490,"And the last time we all played horse, my dad won."
OuOkS2tm89k,448490,450550,"So he's still wearing the crown, I guess,"
OuOkS2tm89k,450550,453069,in the Curry family backyard battles.
OuOkS2tm89k,453070,454392,Wikipedia.
OuOkS2tm89k,454392,457530,"In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan,"
OuOkS2tm89k,457530,461340,"Curry finished with 15 points, but committed 13 turnovers."
OuOkS2tm89k,461340,462680,That is absolute true.
OuOkS2tm89k,462680,463513,They never told me
OuOkS2tm89k,463513,465310,there was a such thing as a bad double double.
OuOkS2tm89k,465310,467030,And I found out the hard way that there is.
OuOkS2tm89k,467030,468389,I had nine at half time.
OuOkS2tm89k,468390,470010,And one of the greatest things that's ever happened
OuOkS2tm89k,470010,473200,"to me is my coach, he called out my lack of discipline,"
OuOkS2tm89k,473200,474033,"taking care of the ball,"
OuOkS2tm89k,474033,475770,but he kept me in the game in the second half.
OuOkS2tm89k,475770,477780,But the next game I had so much more confidence
OuOkS2tm89k,477780,479700,because my coach had confidence in me.
OuOkS2tm89k,479700,482180,"In honor of their 2015 championship,"
OuOkS2tm89k,482180,483800,Golden State visited the White House
OuOkS2tm89k,483800,487030,and president Barack Obama opined that Thompson's jump shot
OuOkS2tm89k,487030,489300,was actually a little prettier than Curry's.
OuOkS2tm89k,489300,491639,"That is an actual fact, he said that,"
OuOkS2tm89k,491640,493810,and I would also argue that he's right.
OuOkS2tm89k,493810,495967,I would definitely classify Klay's jumper as prettier.
OuOkS2tm89k,495967,498560,There are a lot of different ways to get it done.
OuOkS2tm89k,498560,501080,"And if you look at the greatest shooters in history,"
OuOkS2tm89k,501080,502150,everybody shoots differently.
OuOkS2tm89k,502150,505060,So you have to master your own form and your own shot.
OuOkS2tm89k,505060,507210,"All right, let's see some YouTube comments."
OuOkS2tm89k,508323,511080,Is it just me or is there something about the Warriors
OuOkS2tm89k,511080,513360,with off-ball movement and clever passing
OuOkS2tm89k,513360,515810,that just makes the NBA feel so much fun.
OuOkS2tm89k,515810,518800,"Everybody who enjoys the game of basketball,"
OuOkS2tm89k,518800,521380,the way that five guys work together on every possession
OuOkS2tm89k,521380,523830,"to either create a shot or get somebody open,"
OuOkS2tm89k,523830,525580,or set a screen or move without the ball.
OuOkS2tm89k,525580,527590,"Basketball purists love it, I'm one of those."
OuOkS2tm89k,527590,529220,"Such a fun way to play the game,"
OuOkS2tm89k,529220,530810,because everybody feels involved.
OuOkS2tm89k,530810,533150,You get as much pleasure out of scoring the ball
OuOkS2tm89k,533150,535530,as you do getting the assist as you do setting
OuOkS2tm89k,535530,536810,the screen to get somebody open.
OuOkS2tm89k,536810,539120,So it's the way that I learned how to play the game.
OuOkS2tm89k,539120,541787,And I'm glad that I could bring that system
OuOkS2tm89k,541787,544390,and make it successful in the NBA.
OuOkS2tm89k,544390,545223,Because it is hard to do.
OuOkS2tm89k,545223,547910,You gotta have a lot of high IQ guys on the floor
OuOkS2tm89k,547910,548810,to make it happen.
OuOkS2tm89k,551775,555250,I wonder what Steph Curry's favorite 3-1 joke is.
OuOkS2tm89k,555250,556083,None of them.
OuOkS2tm89k,557290,560350,But I seem to not be able to run away from them.
OuOkS2tm89k,560350,562660,So I always just go back and admire the fact
OuOkS2tm89k,562660,564430,that we made five straight finals.
OuOkS2tm89k,564430,566183,I do ignore 2016 though.
OuOkS2tm89k,568290,569370,"All right, that's it."
OuOkS2tm89k,569370,570450,I'm signing out.
OuOkS2tm89k,570450,571926,Peace.
