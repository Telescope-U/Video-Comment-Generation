8YjMIjLLIwA,5342,6510,(cash register ringing)
8YjMIjLLIwA,6510,7950,Or so Apple would have you believe.
8YjMIjLLIwA,7950,10500,"Could this tiny box,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,10500,13559,"basically, two Mac Minis stacked on top of each other,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,13560,16260,really be more powerful than a Core i9
8YjMIjLLIwA,16260,18510,or an RTX 3090 from the PC world?
8YjMIjLLIwA,18510,21600,Or is Apple cherry-picking their data again?
8YjMIjLLIwA,21600,22920,"Come along for the ride,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,22920,26820,because it's more difficult than you'd think to find out.
8YjMIjLLIwA,26820,29160,But it's easy to talk about our sponsor.
8YjMIjLLIwA,29160,31950,- Jackery the Explorer 1500 Power Station

8YjMIjLLIwA,55050,59460,"- We've got both the M1 Max and M1 Ultra Mac Studios here,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,59460,62489,along with a 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro
8YjMIjLLIwA,62490,64710,and a PC bench to compare against.
8YjMIjLLIwA,64710,67470,"For reference, that PC bench runs a little more"
8YjMIjLLIwA,67470,69865,"with shipping than a base-spec M1 Ultra,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,69865,74220,"while our Ultra, as spec'd, costs about $1,800 more."
8YjMIjLLIwA,74220,76110,I wanna start off with gaming this time
8YjMIjLLIwA,76110,78540,because it highlights exactly why
8YjMIjLLIwA,78540,81810,it's so difficult to benchmark Apple silicon.
8YjMIjLLIwA,81810,84000,"Dolphin, a native GameCube emulator"
8YjMIjLLIwA,84000,86820,"that I've tested extensively with M1 chips,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,86820,89310,was struggling to reach frame rates above 120
8YjMIjLLIwA,89310,91500,"when I know it should be capable of much more,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,91500,92820,because I can crank the resolution
8YjMIjLLIwA,92820,94740,without losing much performance.
8YjMIjLLIwA,94740,97290,That indicates that we're hitting a CPU bottleneck
8YjMIjLLIwA,97290,99930,since it only uses a few cores at once.
8YjMIjLLIwA,99930,102180,We are off to a bad start here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,102180,104100,The rest of the games in our typical lineup
8YjMIjLLIwA,104100,105780,use the Rosetta compatibility layer
8YjMIjLLIwA,105780,107640,to translate Intel native apps
8YjMIjLLIwA,107640,109740,because native Apple silicon ports
8YjMIjLLIwA,109740,111487,are few and far between.
8YjMIjLLIwA,111487,113310,"""Civ VI"" is such a mess"
8YjMIjLLIwA,113310,115409,that I don't even want to talk about it.
8YjMIjLLIwA,115410,117960,Firaxis really needs to get on a native board.
8YjMIjLLIwA,117960,120090,Maybe bundle it with some nice expansion packs
8YjMIjLLIwA,120090,121109,if they need to.
8YjMIjLLIwA,121110,123840,(sighs) M1 Ultra doesn't perform very well at all
8YjMIjLLIwA,123840,127289,"in ""CS:GO"" either, with a measly 95 FPS average"
8YjMIjLLIwA,127290,129929,"and a healthy dose of stuttering to go along with it,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,129929,132780,"thanks to that game's use of the OpenGL API,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,132780,134890,long ago deprecated on macOS.
8YjMIjLLIwA,134890,137790,"Feral Interactive's port of ""Shadow of the Tomb Raider"""
8YjMIjLLIwA,137790,138750,does a little bit better
8YjMIjLLIwA,138750,142350,"thanks to using Apple's modern Metal 2 API,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,142350,145140,"but remember, we're running at 1080P here."
8YjMIjLLIwA,145140,148950,"The frame rate simply does not compare to the PC bench,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,148950,151260,and this clearly isn't indicative
8YjMIjLLIwA,151260,153450,of M1 Ultra's performance potential.
8YjMIjLLIwA,153450,156060,"The same is true of ""Total War: Warhammer III,"""
8YjMIjLLIwA,156060,159540,a game that straight up requires Apple silicon.
8YjMIjLLIwA,159540,162510,But runs through Rosetta anyway?
8YjMIjLLIwA,162510,165060,"Yeah, they say that there's no performance penalty"
8YjMIjLLIwA,165060,165892,and they're doing it
8YjMIjLLIwA,165893,169646,because they need certain features only found in Intel Macs.
8YjMIjLLIwA,169646,171450,(sighs) What a mess.
8YjMIjLLIwA,171450,174540,"The M1 Ultra, for its part, breaks the 60 FPS barrier"
8YjMIjLLIwA,174540,177540,at nearly double the performance of the M1 Max
8YjMIjLLIwA,177540,180420,but lags to about half the performance of the PC bench.
8YjMIjLLIwA,180420,182970,"So, a win and a loss."
8YjMIjLLIwA,182970,185670,"Gaming on M1 is such a minefield,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,185670,187020,that the only two games
8YjMIjLLIwA,187020,189270,that are fully native to Apple silicon
8YjMIjLLIwA,189270,191287,"are massively multiplayer,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,191287,193470,"""World of Warcraft"" and ""EVE Online."""
8YjMIjLLIwA,193470,195120,"I've never played ""EVE,"""
8YjMIjLLIwA,195120,198180,and I honestly have no idea how I would benchmark it.
8YjMIjLLIwA,198180,202140,"As for ""WoW,"" last time, my lack of game knowledge"
8YjMIjLLIwA,202140,204390,made our previous benchmark pointless.
8YjMIjLLIwA,204390,207390,"Thankfully, I do know someone who still plays ""WoW,"""
8YjMIjLLIwA,207390,209250,and she threw together a simple Lua script
8YjMIjLLIwA,209250,212370,that logs the current frame rate at regular intervals.
8YjMIjLLIwA,212370,214019,"Letting us for the first time,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,214020,217500,truly get something close to frame data out of a Mac
8YjMIjLLIwA,217500,218850,without pulling a Digital Foundry
8YjMIjLLIwA,218850,221190,and analyzing video capture.
8YjMIjLLIwA,221190,225390,"This is its own minefield within the minefield, however."
8YjMIjLLIwA,225390,227130,Even local multiplayer games
8YjMIjLLIwA,227130,229500,introduce two machines worth of uncertainty
8YjMIjLLIwA,229500,232920,"instead of just one, let alone an MMO with other players"
8YjMIjLLIwA,232920,234990,and server instances to deal with.
8YjMIjLLIwA,234990,238140,"So, we made the script also output the current location"
8YjMIjLLIwA,238140,241830,"and the number of players in the vicinity into CSV format,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,241830,244260,which should let us sanitize our data.
8YjMIjLLIwA,244260,246420,"For our testing, we dragged a Heal Shaman"
8YjMIjLLIwA,246420,248520,through the same area a total of four times
8YjMIjLLIwA,248520,251640,across each of our test systems and averaged the results.
8YjMIjLLIwA,251640,254100,"Before we talked numbers, though, check this out."
8YjMIjLLIwA,254100,256560,"The M1 Ultra exhibited some visual artifacting,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,256560,259260,with assets blinking in and out of existence.
8YjMIjLLIwA,259260,263130,"This didn't affect stability, but it was definitely a thing."
8YjMIjLLIwA,263130,265440,"Clearly, they didn't have the M1 Ultra in mind"
8YjMIjLLIwA,265440,267990,when they made this native port.
8YjMIjLLIwA,267990,269789,"Now, the numbers."
8YjMIjLLIwA,269790,272563,The M1 Ultra impressively captures between 70
8YjMIjLLIwA,272563,275759,and 88% of the RTX 3090 PC bench
8YjMIjLLIwA,275760,278670,and doesn't dip below 60 FPS.
8YjMIjLLIwA,278670,281430,"Meanwhile, the M1 Max doesn't do so hot,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,281430,284759,"which indicates that ""WoW"" is able to utilize either"
8YjMIjLLIwA,284760,287700,those extra CPUs or the additional memory bandwidth
8YjMIjLLIwA,287700,289590,available on M1 Ultra.
8YjMIjLLIwA,289590,291210,Since this test skews heavily
8YjMIjLLIwA,291210,293819,"towards the GPU at 4K Max settings,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,293820,296520,my money is on memory bandwidth.
8YjMIjLLIwA,296520,298710,"Interestingly, the Mac Studio loses"
8YjMIjLLIwA,298710,300750,"less performance than the PC bench does,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,300750,302370,with a consistent 25 players
8YjMIjLLIwA,302370,304860,compared to runs where the players dropped out.
8YjMIjLLIwA,304860,307469,"This could just be run-to-run variance,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,307470,310590,but the fact that it held across both of our Mac Studios
8YjMIjLLIwA,310590,312780,is a pattern worth bringing up.
8YjMIjLLIwA,312780,314400,"But productivity, not gaming,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,314400,315810,is what Apple was talking about
8YjMIjLLIwA,315810,317820,when they said that this was the most powerful desktop
8YjMIjLLIwA,317820,319890,"you can buy for $4,000."
8YjMIjLLIwA,319890,321060,"And to be fair to them,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,321060,323910,it's where most potential buyers will spend their time
8YjMIjLLIwA,323910,325050,with a Mac Studio.
8YjMIjLLIwA,325050,327599,"But there are inconsistencies here too,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,327600,329670,and we'll go through them one by one.
8YjMIjLLIwA,329670,332610,"Cinebench, and Cinema 4D in general,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,332610,335280,"isn't fully ready for Apple silicon,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,335280,338280,but multi-threaded CPU performance isn't far off
8YjMIjLLIwA,338280,341340,"from the Core i9, which is frankly amazing."
8YjMIjLLIwA,341340,343410,"It's basically what we'd expect,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,343410,346500,at double the performance of our M1 Max.
8YjMIjLLIwA,346500,349530,Geekbench is another test that's not fully optimized.
8YjMIjLLIwA,349530,352740,CPU usage doesn't quite max out for some reason.
8YjMIjLLIwA,352740,354569,"But it's not far off per thread,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,354570,357450,and it does surpass the Core i9's
8YjMIjLLIwA,357450,358650,multi-threaded performance.
8YjMIjLLIwA,358650,360780,That is impressive.
8YjMIjLLIwA,360780,363510,"Though it does slip when we move over to the GPU test,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,363510,365790,which is obviously not correct.
8YjMIjLLIwA,365790,367170,"With double the GPU cores,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,367170,368700,"we'd expect a linear improvement,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,368700,370020,unless we're limited somewhere else.
8YjMIjLLIwA,370020,372780,But M1 Ultra is only about 60% faster
8YjMIjLLIwA,372780,376950,"than the M1 Max here, way behind the RTX 3090."
8YjMIjLLIwA,376950,379410,"Let's move away from synthetics and into the real world,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,379410,381720,starting with Blender's CPU rendering.
8YjMIjLLIwA,381720,384090,We're looking at a worse showing than our Core i9
8YjMIjLLIwA,384090,385320,"from both Apple machines,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,385320,388290,albeit with roughly correct scaling between the M1 Ultra
8YjMIjLLIwA,388290,389880,and M1 Max.
8YjMIjLLIwA,389880,392760,This tells me that perhaps there's some optimization
8YjMIjLLIwA,392760,394200,still have to be done here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,394200,397620,"And that's definitely the case with the GPU renderer,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,397620,399510,which is still quite early
8YjMIjLLIwA,399510,402690,"and falls well behind our RTX 3090,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,402690,405180,"which we tested with the traditional CUDA renderer,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,405180,407880,not the ray-accelerated OptiX renderer.
8YjMIjLLIwA,407880,409050,Another major category
8YjMIjLLIwA,409050,411509,for prospective Apple customers is development.
8YjMIjLLIwA,411510,413310,"Compile time isn't everything,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,413310,416130,but with the Mac Studio coming with a minimum
8YjMIjLLIwA,416130,417600,of 32 gigs of RAM
8YjMIjLLIwA,417600,420150,"to take care of most other aspects of dev work,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,420150,423660,compile time is likely to be the limited factor.
8YjMIjLLIwA,423660,426630,"So, we grabbed the Chromium source code and compiled it."
8YjMIjLLIwA,426630,429900,"M1 Ultra is twice as fast as the M1 Max,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,429900,433410,and nearly five minutes ahead of the 12900K.
8YjMIjLLIwA,433410,436110,That's more than 20% faster.
8YjMIjLLIwA,436110,438210,I'm not sure that platform differences alone
8YjMIjLLIwA,438210,439979,would really make that much of a difference
8YjMIjLLIwA,439980,443460,but devs can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,443460,444419,"I can picture them now,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,444420,446257,just typing out angry comments in their WAN hoodies
8YjMIjLLIwA,446257,448754,and dad hats for LTTStore.com
8YjMIjLLIwA,448754,451139,(sighs) Majestic.
8YjMIjLLIwA,451140,454740,"Now for Apple silicon's bread and butter, video editing."
8YjMIjLLIwA,454740,456840,Final Cut Pro allows for timelines
8YjMIjLLIwA,456840,461840,with up to 24 simultaneous raw streams on M1 Ultra
8YjMIjLLIwA,462090,465090,before any frames drop in our multicam test.
8YjMIjLLIwA,465090,467699,Which is such ludicrous performance
8YjMIjLLIwA,467700,469050,that it's tough to imagine
8YjMIjLLIwA,469050,471629,how you would even fully utilize it.
8YjMIjLLIwA,471630,474720,That's the magic of fixed-function hardware.
8YjMIjLLIwA,474720,476820,"What's more, our DaVinci Resolve timeline"
8YjMIjLLIwA,476820,478950,rendered out in a little under 5 1/2 minutes
8YjMIjLLIwA,478950,480240,"on the M1 Ultra,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,480240,483330,"which, while not quite double the performance of M1 Max,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,483330,485280,is still a huge improvement.
8YjMIjLLIwA,485280,488970,It's over 25% ahead of our PC bench here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,488970,492420,"Video encoding, however, is rough,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,492420,496170,thanks to the magic of that fixed-function hardware.
8YjMIjLLIwA,496170,499320,"See, on Floatplane you can download videos directly."
8YjMIjLLIwA,499320,500640,And when I did that
8YjMIjLLIwA,500640,503400,"with our Mac Studio unboxing on ""Short Circuit,"""
8YjMIjLLIwA,503400,505199,both Apple's own Compressor
8YjMIjLLIwA,505200,507810,"and the third-party app HandBrake failed,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,507810,511290,but only while encoding the H.264 codec.
8YjMIjLLIwA,511290,513690,Compressor falls back to the CPU without a word
8YjMIjLLIwA,513690,516810,"and takes forever, while HandBrake just errors out."
8YjMIjLLIwA,516810,519419,"It turns out that Apple's H.264 compression engine,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,519419,521610,"and NVIDIA's NVENC to be fair,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,521610,524310,doesn't support our 2:1 aspect ratio.
8YjMIjLLIwA,524310,527384,"If I scale to consumer 4K during the transcode instead,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,527384,529350,it works just fine.
8YjMIjLLIwA,529350,532860,"Performance-wise, this is worse than a straight transcode,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,532860,536700,but it is still somewhat favorable against NVIDIA.
8YjMIjLLIwA,536700,539190,What's really a head-scratcher for me
8YjMIjLLIwA,539190,543461,is that the cheaper M1 Max pulls ahead in both H.264
8YjMIjLLIwA,543461,548310,and H.265 encoding for reasons I struggled to comprehend.
8YjMIjLLIwA,548310,553310,"I retested this at least a dozen times, and here we are."
8YjMIjLLIwA,553440,557070,"To Apple's credit, ProRes is probably a more common target"
8YjMIjLLIwA,557070,558780,"for transcodes from raw,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,558780,560880,especially given the timeline performance we saw
8YjMIjLLIwA,560880,561780,in Final Cut.
8YjMIjLLIwA,561780,566430,But ProRes encoding time isn't materially better
8YjMIjLLIwA,566430,568410,between any of our Mac.
8YjMIjLLIwA,568410,569399,"Wait, what?"
8YjMIjLLIwA,569400,572910,No. M1 Ultra is clearly several seconds faster than the Max.
8YjMIjLLIwA,572910,574259,What am I talking about?
8YjMIjLLIwA,574260,576510,"Well, okay."
8YjMIjLLIwA,576510,580530,ProRes is more limited by how fast the SSD can write
8YjMIjLLIwA,580530,582780,than how fast the encoder is.
8YjMIjLLIwA,582780,585900,"Our Ultra-equipped Mac Studio and our MacBook Pro,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,585900,588300,"both have one terabyte of storage,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,588300,591510,while our base model M1 Max-equipped Studio
8YjMIjLLIwA,591510,593640,has a 512 gig module.
8YjMIjLLIwA,593640,595591,The bigger SSDs boast much better
8YjMIjLLIwA,595591,597600,"write performance in most scenarios,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,597600,599730,and the difference in ProRes encoding performance
8YjMIjLLIwA,599730,601380,roughly corresponds to the difference
8YjMIjLLIwA,601380,603570,in write speeds across AmorphousDiskMark.
8YjMIjLLIwA,603570,606660,"Moral of the story, avoid the base tier storage option"
8YjMIjLLIwA,606660,608639,if you want the best possible performance
8YjMIjLLIwA,608640,610290,out of your Mac Studio.
8YjMIjLLIwA,610290,611970,There's a reason why the M1 Ultra
8YjMIjLLIwA,611970,614279,comes with a terabyte by default.
8YjMIjLLIwA,614280,615600,"Moving on to Creative Cloud,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,615600,619470,"while most a PugetBench can run natively on Apple silicon,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,619470,622259,the Photoshop plugin needs to run via Rosetta.
8YjMIjLLIwA,622260,623490,"Accordingly, we get overall"
8YjMIjLLIwA,623490,625020,"poor performance in Photoshop here,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,625020,629220,but After Effects and especially Premiere are way better.
8YjMIjLLIwA,629220,631620,"Like, they're out ahead of the PC bench"
8YjMIjLLIwA,631620,635460,to pull one of the highest scores that I have ever seen.
8YjMIjLLIwA,635460,638610,"In fact, even the M1 Max is out ahead in this test too,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,638610,640500,which tells me that Apple's decoders
8YjMIjLLIwA,640500,642960,are doing a lot of heavy lifting here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,642960,644760,Now we need to talk thermals.
8YjMIjLLIwA,644760,646500,The cooler design of the Mac Studio
8YjMIjLLIwA,646500,649050,"differs between the M1 Max and M1 Ultra,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,649050,650550,"with the latter getting a copper,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,650550,651990,rather than aluminum heat sink.
8YjMIjLLIwA,651990,654990,A difference that makes the Ultra two pounds heavier.
8YjMIjLLIwA,654990,656940,"In both cases, the heat sink is attached"
8YjMIjLLIwA,656940,658260,to the same thermal module
8YjMIjLLIwA,658260,660750,that handles cooling for the entire machine.
8YjMIjLLIwA,660750,664500,Testing thermals turned out to be another difficult task.
8YjMIjLLIwA,664500,666060,"Blender alone wasn't cutting it,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,666060,669270,"so, instead, I turned to stress-ng,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,669270,671190,a cross-platform stress test suite
8YjMIjLLIwA,671190,674100,that has native Apple silicon support through Brew.
8YjMIjLLIwA,674100,675569,These are the parameters that I found
8YjMIjLLIwA,675570,677280,"stressed the CPU the most,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,677280,680850,"add in Gooseberry at 3,000 samples to hit the GPU as well"
8YjMIjLLIwA,680850,683459,and you've got yourself an Apple cooker.
8YjMIjLLIwA,683460,685500,I'm not sure if anyone outside of Apple
8YjMIjLLIwA,685500,688380,has pushed M1 Ultra to quite these temperatures before.
8YjMIjLLIwA,688380,692490,This is a mostly synthetic and highly unreasonable load.
8YjMIjLLIwA,692490,694320,But the copper cooler design
8YjMIjLLIwA,694320,696480,is more than capable of handling it.
8YjMIjLLIwA,696480,699510,"Yes, the hottest CPU cores are in the mid to high 90s,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,699510,701460,but the hottest GPU clusters
8YjMIjLLIwA,701460,703860,and memory sensors are nowhere near that.
8YjMIjLLIwA,703860,706170,Meaning the SOC itself is comfortable.
8YjMIjLLIwA,706170,708750,"Not only that, but the fans only ever ramped up"
8YjMIjLLIwA,708750,711720,to around 50% throughout the entire run.
8YjMIjLLIwA,711720,714720,"Not bad, though I bet we could push the GPU a little harder"
8YjMIjLLIwA,714720,718110,if we had a dedicated Apple silicon native stress test.
8YjMIjLLIwA,718110,719459,"The M1 Max, by comparison,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,719460,721680,"fares a bit better in terms of raw heat output,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,721680,723930,but we knew that already.
8YjMIjLLIwA,723930,728010,While the hottest core sensor does slowly creep up
8YjMIjLLIwA,728010,729660,"past the 90-degree mark,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,729660,732060,that aluminum heat sink is more than adequate.
8YjMIjLLIwA,732060,733680,Sensors elsewhere in the package
8YjMIjLLIwA,733680,736170,"show downright cool thermals by PC standards,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,736170,739529,and this time the fans never spun up
8YjMIjLLIwA,739530,741960,much faster than they did at idle.
8YjMIjLLIwA,741960,743160,"With results like that,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,743160,745350,how much power could they possibly be drawing
8YjMIjLLIwA,745350,746639,with this load?
8YjMIjLLIwA,746640,749730,"To get a good idea, we're using a power meter at the wall."
8YjMIjLLIwA,749730,751470,It's worth noting that we've seen at least
8YjMIjLLIwA,751470,752970,three different power supply designs
8YjMIjLLIwA,752970,753899,"from Apple at this point,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,753900,755670,which means efficiency will differ
8YjMIjLLIwA,755670,757920,very slightly between each design.
8YjMIjLLIwA,757920,759930,Is there a best one?
8YjMIjLLIwA,759930,762570,Meh. That's the question for LTT Labs later.
8YjMIjLLIwA,762570,765150,"For now, we can see the idle consumption for the M1 Ultra"
8YjMIjLLIwA,765150,769110,"is a measly 10.8 watts, with the M1 Max at 8.7,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,769110,771420,just a little more than an LED light bulb.
8YjMIjLLIwA,771420,774240,This is why the idle thermal output for both models
8YjMIjLLIwA,774240,775350,is incredibly low
8YjMIjLLIwA,775350,778350,and makes Mac Studio actually a pretty good fit
8YjMIjLLIwA,778350,779550,for hotter climates.
8YjMIjLLIwA,779550,781050,It's worth putting into perspective
8YjMIjLLIwA,781050,782850,"how little power is being used here,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,782850,784560,despite the load I hit them with.
8YjMIjLLIwA,784560,789210,The idle wattage of our Intel bench was just 2/3
8YjMIjLLIwA,789210,792300,of the full load reading on the M1 Max.
8YjMIjLLIwA,792300,796620,"At full bore, it pulled 10 times that"
8YjMIjLLIwA,796620,801330,with CPU cores at 100 degrees under our Noctua NH-D15S.
8YjMIjLLIwA,801330,803760,"True, even Apple's best GPU"
8YjMIjLLIwA,803760,805590,doesn't come near the raw performance
8YjMIjLLIwA,805590,807150,"of this top-end PC hardware,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,807150,810540,but the M1 Ultra racked up over 80%
8YjMIjLLIwA,810540,813810,"of the PC benches performance in overall productivity,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,813810,817200,at 34% of the power draw at full load.
8YjMIjLLIwA,817200,819030,"M1 Max is even more efficient,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,819030,820950,at 57% of the PC's performance
8YjMIjLLIwA,820950,825090,while drawing just 15% of the power under full load.
8YjMIjLLIwA,825090,826890,In a world where PC power consumption
8YjMIjLLIwA,826890,831780,"just creeps ever upward, this is a breath of fresh air."
8YjMIjLLIwA,831780,835050,"Fresh, smogless air."
8YjMIjLLIwA,835050,836764,All this in a machine
8YjMIjLLIwA,836764,837600,(Anthony tapping Mac)
8YjMIjLLIwA,837600,840240,"with the same footprint as the Mac Mini,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,840240,842040,only about twice as tall.
8YjMIjLLIwA,842040,846089,"Admit it, that's impressive for such a small boy."
8YjMIjLLIwA,846090,848760,And it's not all for cooling and power either.
8YjMIjLLIwA,848760,850980,The addition of front IO was a welcome one
8YjMIjLLIwA,850980,853230,"when I unboxed the Mac Studio on ""Short Circuit."""
8YjMIjLLIwA,853230,854699,And with those Type-C ports
8YjMIjLLIwA,854700,857340,"doubling as Thunderbolt 4 ports on the M1 Ultra,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,857340,859140,there's a frankly ridiculous amount
8YjMIjLLIwA,859140,861240,of Thunderbolt on display here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,861240,863250,"Meanwhile, 10 Gig ethernet as standard"
8YjMIjLLIwA,863250,865140,doesn't need anything special to work.
8YjMIjLLIwA,865140,867330,And this tells me that Apple knows
8YjMIjLLIwA,867330,870060,what their professional customers need.
8YjMIjLLIwA,870060,872730,But Apple has always been hesitant
8YjMIjLLIwA,872730,875310,to provide their customers with what they want.
8YjMIjLLIwA,875310,878970,And it's finally time to talk expansion and repairability.
8YjMIjLLIwA,878970,880769,Or lack thereof.
8YjMIjLLIwA,880770,881603,We know by now
8YjMIjLLIwA,881603,884250,that getting into the Mac Studio is a bit painful.
8YjMIjLLIwA,884250,885240,That ring on the bottom
8YjMIjLLIwA,885240,886800,will probably never look the same again
8YjMIjLLIwA,886800,888180,unless you're careful.
8YjMIjLLIwA,888180,890763,But that's not the bad part.
8YjMIjLLIwA,891660,893459,It's the SSD.
8YjMIjLLIwA,893460,895050,You can learn more about our findings
8YjMIjLLIwA,895050,896279,"in this previous video,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,896280,900200,but the TLDR is that these modules are not SSDs
8YjMIjLLIwA,900200,901830,"in the traditional sense,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,901830,904650,but rather only contain raw NAND chips.
8YjMIjLLIwA,904650,906240,The storage controller is integrated
8YjMIjLLIwA,906240,908370,into the M1 series SOCs themselves
8YjMIjLLIwA,908370,910800,and is simply programmed from the factory.
8YjMIjLLIwA,910800,913045,Why can't you just swap or even rearrange them even
8YjMIjLLIwA,913045,915209,with a factory reset?
8YjMIjLLIwA,915210,918360,"Well, Apple has created a de facto allow list"
8YjMIjLLIwA,918360,920550,by only supporting the specific combinations
8YjMIjLLIwA,920550,921959,they're selling.
8YjMIjLLIwA,921960,925800,"This ""because Apple says so"" thing isn't new."
8YjMIjLLIwA,925800,929070,I upgraded my 2011 MacBook Pro with the wifi module
8YjMIjLLIwA,929070,931950,"from the continuity supporting 2012 model,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,931950,934350,"but couldn't use it without a hack,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,934350,938490,specifically because Apple never shipped that configuration
8YjMIjLLIwA,938490,939839,with that model.
8YjMIjLLIwA,939840,942900,It has the drivers didn't bother loading them.
8YjMIjLLIwA,942900,947400,"It's just, ""Okay. You can't use it."" (sighs)"
8YjMIjLLIwA,947400,951240,"But as mad as that makes me, consumers have come to expect"
8YjMIjLLIwA,951240,954180,this kind of limitation from Apple silicon by now.
8YjMIjLLIwA,954180,955170,"So, at the end of the day,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,955170,957842,it all boils down to performance and lasting power.
8YjMIjLLIwA,958680,961350,Will the Mac Studio and M1 Ultra
8YjMIjLLIwA,961350,964290,be relevant in the next five to 10 years?
8YjMIjLLIwA,964290,967350,"Honestly, I'm not so sure."
8YjMIjLLIwA,967350,970060,The greatest irony with the M1 Ultra
8YjMIjLLIwA,971070,975510,"is that the one thing that it's really, really good at"
8YjMIjLLIwA,975510,978870,is also the one thing that M1 Max
8YjMIjLLIwA,978870,983870,"is already really, really good at, video editing."
8YjMIjLLIwA,983910,987569,"Unless you absolutely need access to 128 gigs of memory,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,987570,989730,"or you do a lot of VFX work,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,989730,992370,chances are you'll never fully appreciate the extra power
8YjMIjLLIwA,992370,994830,that it affords you until it's already obsolete.
8YjMIjLLIwA,994830,997200,"If your use cases are covered by the few exceptions,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,997200,1000620,"like compilation and Resolve, then M1 Ultra is great."
8YjMIjLLIwA,1000620,1002630,"Otherwise, wherever it's not"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1002630,1005000,"within spitting distance of M1 Max,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1005000,1006800,it's still matched or outmatched
8YjMIjLLIwA,1006800,1009170,by PCs that cost the same or less.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1009170,1011480,"Now, this could be an optimization thing"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1011480,1013940,"that Apple will just have to deal with in the future,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1013940,1017840,with additional updates to Swift and Xcode.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1017840,1020480,"But, for now, that's just the reality."
8YjMIjLLIwA,1020480,1023329,"As for the Mac Studio itself,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1023330,1026180,"like M1 Ultra, it's impressive."
8YjMIjLLIwA,1026180,1028400,But as excited as I was when it was announced...
8YjMIjLLIwA,1028400,1030530,"Thank you, Apple!"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1030530,1032390,Now I'm not sure I get the point.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1032390,1034339,"It lacks peripherals and a display,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1034339,1036829,"and it shares many of Apple silicon's current limitations,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1036829,1040069,like the lack of 48Gbps second HDMI output.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1040069,1042169,"If you buy Apple's matching peripherals,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1042170,1044780,the cost of owning even the base model
8YjMIjLLIwA,1044780,1048230,works out to be more than a MacBook Pro with the same specs
8YjMIjLLIwA,1048230,1050299,and anchors it to a desk.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1050300,1052040,A MacBook Pro with the same SOC
8YjMIjLLIwA,1052040,1053540,"can drive the same Studio Display,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1053540,1056510,"has the same HDMI output, and has the same card reader."
8YjMIjLLIwA,1056510,1059750,You can bring a MacBook's IO up to speed with a dock too.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1059750,1061910,This one not only provides more connectivity
8YjMIjLLIwA,1061910,1064370,"than the Mac Studio would have, with a Studio Display,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1064370,1068270,"but it costs $400 and also supports audio-video bridging,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1068270,1069260,something that I'm told
8YjMIjLLIwA,1069260,1071690,Apple silicon's LAN ports drop support for
8YjMIjLLIwA,1071690,1075440,but is critically important for broadcast work.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1075440,1077600,The total cost of a MacBook Pro with this dock
8YjMIjLLIwA,1077600,1079910,"remains well below that of the Studio setup,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1079910,1082700,even if you got the 16-inch model.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1082700,1085039,Mac Studio's only saving grace
8YjMIjLLIwA,1085040,1087650,is that you don't have to buy the Studio Display
8YjMIjLLIwA,1087650,1090830,"or Magic peripherals, Apple just expects you to."
8YjMIjLLIwA,1090830,1093649,We'll have them linked down below just in case.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1093650,1095960,And this really is the overall theme here.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1095960,1098539,Apple expects you to want the M1 Ultra.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1098540,1099713,You probably don't.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1100610,1102470,Apple expects you to think
8YjMIjLLIwA,1102470,1104390,that the Mac Studio is a good value.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1104390,1106190,It's really not.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1106190,1109220,"What it is, is a uniquely compact, efficient,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1109220,1111710,"and surprisingly powerful machine,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1111710,1113330,"but with a price tag to match,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1113330,1115399,and without matching the PC competition
8YjMIjLLIwA,1115400,1118400,in terms of performance in most workloads.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1118400,1120680,"If it aligns with your priorities, then great,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1120680,1123290,I can't tell you not to shell out for it.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1123290,1124910,"If your priority is value,"
8YjMIjLLIwA,1124910,1127340,then Apple has trapped themselves into a corner
8YjMIjLLIwA,1127340,1131270,with how ludicrously good the 2021 MacBook Pros already are.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1131270,1133130,And those even come with MagSafe.
8YjMIjLLIwA,1133130,1135260,Just like this video comes with a segue to our sponsor.
