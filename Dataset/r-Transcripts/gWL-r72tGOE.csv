gWL-r72tGOE,4480,10280,"With prices starting at Â£50,000, it's cheaper than a proper Range Rover"
gWL-r72tGOE,10360,16640,"and because it's available with seven seats, it's more practical as well."
gWL-r72tGOE,16720,18519,"But like I said, at the beginning,"
gWL-r72tGOE,18600,21240,the old Range Rover Sport was a bit of a fraud.
gWL-r72tGOE,21320,27039,"The question must be, is this one really a Range Rover and is it a Sport?"
gWL-r72tGOE,27120,28920,Let's start with that first bit.
gWL-r72tGOE,32040,35760,"No matter how much wood and leather it's fitted with,"
gWL-r72tGOE,35840,41080,the mark of a real Range Rover is being able to tackle this sort of stuff.
gWL-r72tGOE,45960,48719,"Important work being done, coming through."
gWL-r72tGOE,51440,53280,"Well, the first thing you need to know"
gWL-r72tGOE,53360,57480,is that this is not a Discovery in a Range Rover frock.
gWL-r72tGOE,57560,59800,It has the proper Range Rover chassis
gWL-r72tGOE,59880,63360,and the same terrain response system as well.
gWL-r72tGOE,63440,66479,This analyses the ground you're driving over
gWL-r72tGOE,66560,69360,"and automatically adjusts the suspension, gearbox,"
gWL-r72tGOE,69440,71640,brakes and engine output to suit.
gWL-r72tGOE,75840,78799,"Big, big, almost vertical hill now!"
gWL-r72tGOE,83200,86039,"Very steep, very steep, very muddy."
gWL-r72tGOE,91520,94000,That is... that is a climb.
gWL-r72tGOE,94080,95240,"Well done, you."
gWL-r72tGOE,99080,102600,"Besides the terrain response, there's also a computer"
gWL-r72tGOE,102680,107160,that disconnects the anti-roll bars to increase wheel articulation.
gWL-r72tGOE,111280,113080,We're over.
gWL-r72tGOE,113160,117680,"I mean, that was a big old cross-axling hump to get over."
gWL-r72tGOE,117760,119080,It didn't even notice!
gWL-r72tGOE,120840,122560,And there's more.
gWL-r72tGOE,122640,124920,Ah! Water.
gWL-r72tGOE,125000,128119,Good. Gives me a chance to play with something else I have on board
gWL-r72tGOE,128200,129479,and that is...
gWL-r72tGOE,130880,132640,sonar. Kid you not!
gWL-r72tGOE,139520,142360,Sonar transmitters and receivers in the door mirrors
gWL-r72tGOE,142440,144200,measure the depth of the water.
gWL-r72tGOE,144280,146560,It'll make a big noise if it's getting too deep.
gWL-r72tGOE,150680,152120,"It's not worried, not worried."
gWL-r72tGOE,155320,159200,I feel like I'm driving a luxury hotel room through a swamp.
gWL-r72tGOE,160840,161680,Cool.
gWL-r72tGOE,163920,165920,Oh-ho! That's steep!
gWL-r72tGOE,172880,176480,Just pretty much like it never...
gWL-r72tGOE,176560,178680,"There, I think I've repaired that."
gWL-r72tGOE,178760,182239,More or less. That's how it was.
gWL-r72tGOE,182320,183720,Good.
gWL-r72tGOE,184920,186319,"So, there we are."
gWL-r72tGOE,186400,191000,"This car, in the right hands, is very good off-road."
gWL-r72tGOE,191080,195720,"And now we must move on, to this bit of the badge."
gWL-r72tGOE,198680,201159,Welcome to Donington Park racetrack.
gWL-r72tGOE,201240,205400,"And if the Sport is as sporty as Land Rover claims,"
gWL-r72tGOE,205480,207879,it should put on a good show here.
gWL-r72tGOE,218280,221160,"Now, you can get these with a V6 or a V8 diesel."
gWL-r72tGOE,221240,226320,"The one I'm in is the supercharged petrol V8 with 503-brake horsepower,"
gWL-r72tGOE,226400,228799,"so, that is the power taken care of."
gWL-r72tGOE,230040,233400,And because it's built on the brand-new all-aluminium chassis
gWL-r72tGOE,233480,235040,"of the proper Range Rover,"
gWL-r72tGOE,235120,238760,it's getting on for half a ton lighter than the old Sport.
gWL-r72tGOE,241120,243920,"That turn, lift and then it comes around and then bang!"
gWL-r72tGOE,244840,247840,503-braked all four wheels and off you go!
gWL-r72tGOE,253160,255000,"And as well as the weight loss,"
gWL-r72tGOE,255080,258720,"the computer-controlled suspension fights body roll,"
gWL-r72tGOE,258799,263039,"and there's an active rear diff, like you'd get on a BMW M5."
gWL-r72tGOE,265040,267720,"It also has something called torque vectoring,"
gWL-r72tGOE,267800,272000,which dictates how much power is sent to each of the wheels and when.
gWL-r72tGOE,272080,274319,"I mean, that is supercar stuff."
gWL-r72tGOE,274400,277320,That's what you get on the McLaren 12C road car.
gWL-r72tGOE,279440,283960,"What's staggering me right now is that hurling this car around this racetrack,"
gWL-r72tGOE,284040,287360,it doesn't feel like I'm asking it to do anything it doesn't want to do.
gWL-r72tGOE,287440,289360,It feels at home.
gWL-r72tGOE,291440,295920,"All in all, on a track, it's good. But how good?"
gWL-r72tGOE,297680,298880,"Well, to find out,"
gWL-r72tGOE,298960,302759,"we must, as ever, call on the help of the world's chattiest racing driver."
gWL-r72tGOE,303240,306960,"Today, The Stig is in a Mini John Cooper Works GP,"
gWL-r72tGOE,307040,310640,one of the most hardcore hot-hatches you can buy.
gWL-r72tGOE,311800,315360,"And now, he's going to use it to set a lap time."
gWL-r72tGOE,315440,318000,When you're ready... go!
gWL-r72tGOE,332320,336960,"Now, let's find out if that can be beaten by the big, bulky four by four."
gWL-r72tGOE,337480,341360,"And to oversee proceedings, I shall ride shotgun."
gWL-r72tGOE,344360,345759,"The beauty of this is,"
gWL-r72tGOE,345840,350600,"he has no idea what that last car was called, no idea what he's in now."
gWL-r72tGOE,351840,353639,"Doesn't care. No bias, you see."
gWL-r72tGOE,353720,356720,All he can do is try and go as fast as he can.
gWL-r72tGOE,359800,361120,And we're off!
gWL-r72tGOE,363760,367760,"Head towards the first corner, not braking at all for the first corner."
gWL-r72tGOE,367840,370880,"Oh, that's very, very quick down there!"
gWL-r72tGOE,372080,374080,Some wee might have come out there.
gWL-r72tGOE,375480,377240,Whoa! Brakes work. That's good.
gWL-r72tGOE,378960,380479,I'm not worried about putting him off
gWL-r72tGOE,380560,384440,because this is just like a quacking noise for him. It's irrelevant.
gWL-r72tGOE,386520,392599,"It's worth remembering about now that this is still a very big, heavy car."
gWL-r72tGOE,392680,395800,It weighs more than the heaviest Mercedes S-class.
gWL-r72tGOE,397120,401080,"But even at Stig speed, the Sport seemed to have everything in order."
gWL-r72tGOE,401160,404600,"We should be The Leaning Tower of Range Rover Sport right now,"
gWL-r72tGOE,404680,407199,but somehow we're not. It's fantastic!
gWL-r72tGOE,411160,414440,We just crossed over a minute.
gWL-r72tGOE,414520,419520,That's the longest protracted tyre squeal in the history of tyres and squealing.
gWL-r72tGOE,421520,425240,"Oh, that is... My, that was flying."
gWL-r72tGOE,425320,427400,Chicane! That is fast.
gWL-r72tGOE,431520,433919,And on to the final straight.
gWL-r72tGOE,434000,435320,129.8 to beat.
gWL-r72tGOE,439960,443680,129.5. There it is.
gWL-r72tGOE,447400,451840,"So, after years of writing cheques it can't cash,"
gWL-r72tGOE,451920,458240,this car has finally earned the right to be called the Range Rover Sport.
