2DyLLsXt7wI,43520,44879,we talked about the wobble seam the
2DyLLsXt7wI,44879,46800,wobble ball that's the one i think that
2DyLLsXt7wI,46800,48879,sanger might think about rather than
2DyLLsXt7wI,48879,50399,swinging and swinging away it's the one
2DyLLsXt7wI,50399,52160,that would trouble him i would imagine
2DyLLsXt7wI,52160,53440,coming around the wicket but just that
2DyLLsXt7wI,53440,55520,bat looks so wide at the moment right
2DyLLsXt7wI,55520,57199,rue enough enough defense try and get
2DyLLsXt7wI,57199,58960,him some drives kumar try and do some
2DyLLsXt7wI,58960,63640,square drives if it's full enough

2DyLLsXt7wI,90640,92640,game who averages 57 in test match
2DyLLsXt7wI,92640,94960,cricket what do you make of england's
2DyLLsXt7wI,94960,97680,new mindset and mccallum cricket what do
2DyLLsXt7wI,97680,99520,you make of it i'm a little bit jealous
2DyLLsXt7wI,99520,100880,actually but i think it's absolutely
2DyLLsXt7wI,100880,103119,fantastic it's essential for the game
2DyLLsXt7wI,103119,105280,and i think where england is as a team i
2DyLLsXt7wI,105280,107200,think it's essential for them
2DyLLsXt7wI,107200,109360,because this culture
2DyLLsXt7wI,109360,112399,is going to really force people to step
2DyLLsXt7wI,112399,115040,up and get better and have an attitude
2DyLLsXt7wI,115040,116799,of hunger that's actually going to
2DyLLsXt7wI,116799,118880,improve not just the team but also the
2DyLLsXt7wI,118880,121119,individual i've it's happened to me i
2DyLLsXt7wI,121119,122240,think it's happened to a lot of greats
2DyLLsXt7wI,122240,123360,around the world
2DyLLsXt7wI,123360,125280,when you build a career you have an
2DyLLsXt7wI,125280,127280,average you have the runs and the
2DyLLsXt7wI,127280,128879,reputation
2DyLLsXt7wI,128879,130479,you sometimes get selfish to try and
2DyLLsXt7wI,130479,133280,protect that reputation but this culture
2DyLLsXt7wI,133280,134959,that baz and ben stokes are trying to
2DyLLsXt7wI,134959,136000,build
2DyLLsXt7wI,136000,138239,is actually going to force people to
2DyLLsXt7wI,138239,140319,step out of their comfort zones and
2DyLLsXt7wI,140319,142160,every single time they go out to play
2DyLLsXt7wI,142160,144239,play the cricket that they know they
2DyLLsXt7wI,144239,146560,want to play that they started playing
2DyLLsXt7wI,146560,148239,the reason why they love this game and
2DyLLsXt7wI,148239,150080,that is enjoyment
2DyLLsXt7wI,150080,152959,freedom expression of skill and talent
2DyLLsXt7wI,152959,155360,and then even the joe root who are great
2DyLLsXt7wI,155360,157360,of the game and the rest of those
2DyLLsXt7wI,157360,159440,players around them will get pushed
2DyLLsXt7wI,159440,161519,every single time every single series
2DyLLsXt7wI,161519,162319,month
2DyLLsXt7wI,162319,163280,year
2DyLLsXt7wI,163280,165519,just to keep improving and play for each
2DyLLsXt7wI,165519,167440,other play for the team and play for the
2DyLLsXt7wI,167440,171040,spectators that come to watch them
