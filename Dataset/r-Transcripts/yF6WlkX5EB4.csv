yF6WlkX5EB4,8320,14240,[Music]  am i the for holding my wedding  at the same venue as my first husband's
yF6WlkX5EB4,14240,19880,funeral  that's so me
yF6WlkX5EB4,19880,27119,[Laughter]  that's so some i would do oh okay  let's see let's let's get the context
yF6WlkX5EB4,27119,33360,last summer my first husband passed away  after being in a car accident a month  before the doctors expected him to pull
yF6WlkX5EB4,33360,38719,through yet be paralyzed from the waist  down but he already had health problems  and the trauma from the accident
yF6WlkX5EB4,38719,45520,ultimately prevailed i and his parents  organized a funeral at a spacious old  catholic cathedral i kept thinking to
yF6WlkX5EB4,45520,52640,myself the whole time this place is too  beautiful for a funeral for some reason  it felt wrong having such a sad occasion
yF6WlkX5EB4,52640,58960,there i even remember wishing that i had  married my first husband there instead  of the outdoor wedding we had fast
yF6WlkX5EB4,58960,64960,forward to early 2022. i reunited with  an ex-boyfriend of mine from years  before we started dating again and
yF6WlkX5EB4,64960,70080,always the ex i think it's always the  one they told you not to worry about and  before we knew it we were engaged i've
yF6WlkX5EB4,70080,75280,been criticized a lot for how fast i  moved on but i guess everyone heals  differently we started planning for the
yF6WlkX5EB4,75280,80880,wedding in march the wedding hasn't  happened yet it will be in may and we  decided that we'd have it at the same
yF6WlkX5EB4,80880,86880,cathedral where my first husband's  funeral was held i'm still in contact  with my first husband's parents and they
yF6WlkX5EB4,86880,92240,were happy for me when i told them i was  dating and when i got engaged in a phone  call my first husband's mother asked
yF6WlkX5EB4,92240,99040,about the wedding so i said that they  could come if they wanted to she seemed  a bit taken aback at first so i totally  thought i screwed up but she then said
yF6WlkX5EB4,99040,106320,she'd love to then i told her that it  would be held at the same cathedral as  my first husband's funeral and
yF6WlkX5EB4,106320,112079,she went off on me i don't know how to  explain what happened other than to just  write the conversation down me we will
yF6WlkX5EB4,112079,117520,be marrying at the blank cathedral  silence her i just can't believe it
yF6WlkX5EB4,117520,122719,believe what silence i'm sorry this is  just appalling to me
yF6WlkX5EB4,122719,128560,me i want to have our wedding there in  honor of first husband i would have  married him there if i knew about the
yF6WlkX5EB4,128560,135120,place silence her you're moving on too  quickly you need to slow down think of  how first husband would feel you can't
yF6WlkX5EB4,135120,141200,replace him you've moved on you've moved  on  blank first husband's name hasn't moved
yF6WlkX5EB4,141200,146800,on he will never move on  because he's dead  and i'm sure if he were alive he'd want
yF6WlkX5EB4,146800,151840,to me i'm sorry she hangs up the phone i  haven't spoken to her or her husband
yF6WlkX5EB4,151840,157360,since i'm still planning on having me  and my fiance's wedding there  but it just puts a bad taste in my mouth
yF6WlkX5EB4,157360,163840,knowing that my first husband's parents  are against it but after all they aren't  involved in the wedding anyways so i  don't see why they should have a say i
yF6WlkX5EB4,163840,170879,wish they'd at least support me because  i've been to hell and back i'm in a  better place and they don't like to see  me happy but i also kind of feel selfish
yF6WlkX5EB4,170879,177200,since they aren't am i the  definitely yeah there's a  million places you could have your  wedding and like i understand her like
yF6WlkX5EB4,177200,183440,thought process of like i'm honoring but  i think in if that's the way that you're  thinking right now then you're still in
yF6WlkX5EB4,183440,188640,one of the five stages of grief  you might still be in denial babe story  time about the girl who was weirdly
yF6WlkX5EB4,188640,195120,obsessed with my best friend so a little  background information i was 14 and in  ninth grade and i went to a private
yF6WlkX5EB4,195120,200800,school so there was only one class per  grade so my best friend and i were in  class together and we're going to call
yF6WlkX5EB4,200800,206799,her bella and then there was this girl  gabby who had kind of been friends with  for almost a year well gabby was a
yF6WlkX5EB4,206799,212080,for popularity like anything that the  popular kids would ask her to do she  would get on her hands and knees and do
yF6WlkX5EB4,212080,217920,it this woman did not care well we had a  project working up so all three of us  decided to work on it together so i
yF6WlkX5EB4,217920,224239,invited them over my house and gabby  said that she needed to use the bathroom  so bella offered to show her where the
yF6WlkX5EB4,224239,230799,bathroom was probably three minutes  later bella comes running up the stairs  like she just saw a ghost she was
yF6WlkX5EB4,230799,236319,telling me that gabby took all of her  clothes off and tried making out with  her well that night they both spent the
yF6WlkX5EB4,236319,242239,night and i wake up in the middle of the  night to gabby pinning bella to the wall  trying to kiss her but i went back to
yF6WlkX5EB4,242239,249280,sleep and acted like nothing ever  happened fast forward it got to the  point where bella was actually feeling  really unsafe so her parents switched
yF6WlkX5EB4,249280,254319,her schools  storytelling about how my boyfriend and  best friend were sneaking around behind
yF6WlkX5EB4,254319,260720,my back so a little background  information i was 15 and in 10th grade  so my mom and dad were split up and i
yF6WlkX5EB4,260720,266639,was pretty much allowed to do whatever i  wanted because of that so i was dating  this boy named jacob well my best friend
yF6WlkX5EB4,266639,273199,alice literally hated him like loki  every once in a while she would try to  break him and i up and when i would call
yF6WlkX5EB4,273199,279040,her out on it she would just deny it  anyway so the one day i didn't go to  school because i was super sick so the
yF6WlkX5EB4,279040,285840,whole day i was trying to text jacob and  alison but nobody was answering me which  was extremely weird because no matter
yF6WlkX5EB4,285840,292560,what alison would always text me back so  after i knew the school ended i went to  allison's house nobody was answering the
yF6WlkX5EB4,292560,299840,door so i use the spare key i walk in  and all i hear is a very loud banging  coming from her bedroom so i walk in i
yF6WlkX5EB4,299840,305440,see my boyfriend and her together and  then he starts saying that she drugged  him so i went on his phone i see a bunch
yF6WlkX5EB4,305440,311600,of little text messages between him and  her and them exchanging pictures and  then sis wants to start giving me an
yF6WlkX5EB4,311600,318000,attitude so i punched her in the face  and then i left and i don't talk to  either of them  story time about how i almost got
yF6WlkX5EB4,318000,324400,kidnapped by my online boyfriend so a  little background information i was 16  and in 11th grade
yF6WlkX5EB4,324400,331680,so a year before this all happened i  posted a picture on instagram saying add  me on snapchat if you want to be friends
yF6WlkX5EB4,331680,337039,yes i was that person anyway so this  really cute guy adds me on snapchat and
yF6WlkX5EB4,337039,343520,after about three months talking he said  that he wants to meet me in person and  he didn't sound suss at all so i was
yF6WlkX5EB4,343520,350080,like sure so we met at this park that  was like 30 minutes away we met there  around six o'clock so when the sun was
yF6WlkX5EB4,350080,357120,setting and he was super nice it was  super romantic well then we went to his  house we watched a movie and we did the
yF6WlkX5EB4,357120,363840,nasty so after that he asked me if i  want to drink and what i could have  sworn was 20 minutes later i wake up in
yF6WlkX5EB4,363840,369360,an abandoned farm shed no clothes or  anything so i start screaming my head
yF6WlkX5EB4,369360,374800,off i don't have my phone or anything so  i start to run and then he grabs me he
yF6WlkX5EB4,374800,380080,says if you try to run or you try to  scream i am going to kill you life for
yF6WlkX5EB4,380080,385680,part  part 2 about how i almost got kidnapped  by my online boyfriend so like i said i
yF6WlkX5EB4,385680,393680,wake up in this abandoned farm shed i  don't have no clothes i don't have a  phone so i try to run and he grabs me he
yF6WlkX5EB4,393680,398800,says that if you run i will kill you so  i was like okay fine what do you want
yF6WlkX5EB4,398800,404319,from me so he starts putting on lingerie  and tells me to also put some on so we
yF6WlkX5EB4,404319,411039,can take pictures together  what the actual you know what so after  that he starts crying and he starts
yF6WlkX5EB4,411039,416160,telling me his whole life story and how  he's not who i think he is turns out
yF6WlkX5EB4,416160,423039,that he's 32  and he just goes online pretending that  he's 17 years old so i just try to
yF6WlkX5EB4,423039,428080,comfort him right it ends up working he  brings me my clothes tells me to run or
yF6WlkX5EB4,428080,434240,else he's going to once again kill me so  i run i go to this gas station get
yF6WlkX5EB4,434240,439520,picked up by the police find my parents  luckily for me i paid attention to where
yF6WlkX5EB4,439520,445759,everything was he was arrested he's  still in prison to this day and i got  grounded for three months
yF6WlkX5EB4,445759,452000,every time about how i ruined my ex best  friend's relationship and reputation in  two days so a little background
yF6WlkX5EB4,452000,459199,information i was 14 and 8th grade i was  in a very toxic friend group of three  and we all secretly talk crap about each
yF6WlkX5EB4,459199,464560,other so two of the girls in my friend  group decided that they didn't want to  be friends with me anymore for
yF6WlkX5EB4,464560,470160,absolutely no reason the one girl texted  me saying i don't want to be friends  with you anymore and then the other girl
yF6WlkX5EB4,470160,475440,literally just played along with it  because she can't think for herself she  was like yeah i've been planning on
yF6WlkX5EB4,475440,481840,doing this for like two weeks so i got  very embarrassed by this because they  started going around the school telling
yF6WlkX5EB4,481840,488160,everybody about it and not to sound like  that person but i was really popular i  had a lot more friends than them and the
yF6WlkX5EB4,488160,494720,only reason why people like them was  because they were my friends anyway so i  started texting the boys that they liked
yF6WlkX5EB4,494720,500000,and i was like hey i think you should  know that they've been talking to other  people while they're talking to you and
yF6WlkX5EB4,500000,506160,i just thought that was really wrong and  when they asked who i gave them names of  boys that they both used to talk to and
yF6WlkX5EB4,506160,513200,then when the girls texted me about it  liked her  two about how i ruined my ex best  friend's relationship and reputation in
yF6WlkX5EB4,513200,518479,two days so like i said i texted the  boys that they like saying that they  were talking to other people and then of
yF6WlkX5EB4,518479,523680,course my ex best friends got mad and  then they started texting me about it  saying oh why are you lying blah blah
yF6WlkX5EB4,523680,529440,blah blah and i was like honestly i just  think it's really wrong for you to try  and play these boys who actually have
yF6WlkX5EB4,529440,536399,feelings for you yes i know i was a  little crazy but who isn't anyway so  then i decided to get my mom involved
yF6WlkX5EB4,536399,542560,because i had been friends with these  girls for a while so my mom knew their  parents very well so i told my mom i was
yF6WlkX5EB4,542560,549680,really worried about them because they  were starting to get into really bad  stuff and hanging out with the wrong  crowd so i couldn't be friends with them
yF6WlkX5EB4,549680,555839,and they tried to talk me into doing  stuff so then my mom called their  parents well then their mom started to
yF6WlkX5EB4,555839,562399,drop them off and pick them up every day  because they were grounded well then  their mom started to apologize to my mom
yF6WlkX5EB4,562399,568399,because their kids were such bad  influences on me and then when everybody  asked why we stopped being friends i
yF6WlkX5EB4,568399,574399,told them that they made fun of my  grandma who isn't alive and four years  later everybody still hates them
yF6WlkX5EB4,574399,580560,story time about how i caught my grandma  with my dad so a little background  information i was 16 and it was the
yF6WlkX5EB4,580560,586399,first day of 11th grade well my friend  wanted me to come to the mall with her  after school that day she was like screw
yF6WlkX5EB4,586399,591920,your grandma's birthday just come to the  mall with me so the plan was i would  sneak onto my best friend's bus after
yF6WlkX5EB4,591920,597279,school and skip my grandma's birthday by  the way my grandma was low-key a-ho like
yF6WlkX5EB4,597279,604399,half of her kids won't even bring their  husbands around her because after she  got their numbers she would end up  sending nude pictures to them anyway so
yF6WlkX5EB4,604399,610480,the end of the day rolls around and i go  to my locker to get my book bag when i'm  called down to the office so i go down
yF6WlkX5EB4,610480,615600,to the office and my mom is there to  pick me up because she said that we  needed to do a few things before our
yF6WlkX5EB4,615600,621440,grandma's party well my grandma was at  our house getting ready and my mom  forgot her wallet at home so when we
yF6WlkX5EB4,621440,628399,went back home i went to go put my book  bag in the house when i walk in and i  see my grandma and dad on the couch and
yF6WlkX5EB4,628399,634160,i'm not even gonna say what they were  doing and my mom is walking past them  like she didn't see anything so after
yF6WlkX5EB4,634160,639600,that i called one of my aunts and asked  if i could stay with her for a while and  now i don't talk to any of them
yF6WlkX5EB4,639600,645760,every time about how i was almost  kidnapped so a little background  information i was 13 and it was the
yF6WlkX5EB4,645760,652640,summer going into ninth grade i was on a  road trip with my family and we needed  to stop for some gas so we stopped at
yF6WlkX5EB4,652640,659680,some random gas station and we see this  lady get out of her car and walk in no  big deal though so we're inside and
yF6WlkX5EB4,659680,665519,we're waiting in line to use the  bathroom so we were in the front of the  line and then that lady was behind us
yF6WlkX5EB4,665519,671839,and then there were a few people behind  her so as we're standing in line she  facetimed some guy and then she starts
yF6WlkX5EB4,671839,678800,pointing the camera at people around the  store and she would be like oh do you  like this and he would say yes or no
yF6WlkX5EB4,678800,683839,well then she points the phone at me and  then he goes yeah that's the one and my
yF6WlkX5EB4,683839,689760,mom and i were super creeped out about  this because she was being super loud  and she was taking a really long time at
yF6WlkX5EB4,689760,694959,this gas station so my mom goes into the  bathroom and then she starts to talk to
yF6WlkX5EB4,694959,702880,me she starts asking how old i am where  i'm from and if my mom and i were here  with anybody else like for part two or
yF6WlkX5EB4,702880,710240,two about how i was almost kidnapped so  like i said she starts to talk to me and  ask me super personal questions and i'm
yF6WlkX5EB4,710240,716560,being vague about everything that i  possibly can be so i go in i use the  restroom after my mom we grab some
yF6WlkX5EB4,716560,722880,snacks and then she follows us around  the whole store and she didn't even use  the bathroom so we leave the store and
yF6WlkX5EB4,722880,729120,we saw the car that she got out of and  it was parked right next to our car when  originally it was parked all the way
yF6WlkX5EB4,729120,735680,across the parking lot and i'm guessing  the man who she was on face time with  was in the car and he was sitting right
yF6WlkX5EB4,735680,742160,where my car door was so my mom and i  decided to walk around a little bit and  this lady is just following behind us
yF6WlkX5EB4,742160,747920,the whole time we call my dad who was  across the street at another store we  told him about the situation so he comes
yF6WlkX5EB4,747920,753920,and picks us up and then he sees the car  pick the lady up and they start  following us so then they followed us
yF6WlkX5EB4,753920,759519,for about 25 to 30 freaking miles and  then they ended up turning off on some
yF6WlkX5EB4,759519,764560,random road and i have a feeling if my  mom and i didn't pay such close  attention to what they were doing i
yF6WlkX5EB4,764560,771440,would have been kidnapped and trafficked  every time about my toxic best friend  group so a little background information
yF6WlkX5EB4,771440,778079,i was 16 and it was the end of ninth  grade going into summer break and one  day randomly these three girls added me
yF6WlkX5EB4,778079,784720,on snapchat and put me into a group chat  now i had seen them around school but i  never said hi to them i was finding it
yF6WlkX5EB4,784720,790959,very hard to make friends in ninth grade  because everybody was so toxic anyways  like i said they added me to a group
yF6WlkX5EB4,790959,797760,chat and all of them said hi to me and  usually i wouldn't respond to random  people on snapchat but because i had
yF6WlkX5EB4,797760,803680,seen them around school i decided why  not it was so random they just started  sending pictures of themselves into this
yF6WlkX5EB4,803680,810079,group chat and loki made me feel bad  because i kind of hated my physical  appearance but anyways they asked me if
yF6WlkX5EB4,810079,816079,i wanted to be friends with them oh and  by the way their names were stacy  savannah and emily so of course i said
yF6WlkX5EB4,816079,822160,yeah because it was hard for me to make  friends so fast forward my birthday was  coming up so they asked me if we could
yF6WlkX5EB4,822160,827199,hang out they said they wanted to give  me an early birthday present so i said
yF6WlkX5EB4,827199,834240,yes of course  like for part two  or two about my toxic friend group so
yF6WlkX5EB4,834240,840639,like i said they asked me if we could  hang out to give me an early birthday  present so i said yeah and emily had a
yF6WlkX5EB4,840639,846320,pool at her house so they asked me if i  wanted to go over there and of course i  said yeah it was summertime and it was
yF6WlkX5EB4,846320,853279,hot outside well when i got there they  asked me to order the pizza and they  said that i had to pay for it so i said
yF6WlkX5EB4,853279,860560,yeah because they were my besties at the  time  so i used some of my birthday money to  pay for the pizza for all of us and when
yF6WlkX5EB4,860560,866399,i got back to emily's house they were  all already in the pool so i was kind of  mad one because they didn't go with me
yF6WlkX5EB4,866399,872240,and two they were just hanging out  without me so we're sitting there eating  the pizza and then after all three of
yF6WlkX5EB4,872240,878240,them get in the pool and they start  taking pictures with each other not even  asking me to be in any pictures so at
yF6WlkX5EB4,878240,883920,that point i was so annoyed i was just  like you guys are being so rude and  emily's like what are you talking about
yF6WlkX5EB4,883920,890240,we didn't even do anything and then of  course stacy and savannah agreed i was  like one you didn't even ask me to be in
yF6WlkX5EB4,890240,896560,any pictures and you made me pay for the  pizza for all of us and she was like  you're ugly we didn't want you in the  pictures so i threw the pizza away and
yF6WlkX5EB4,896560,903440,went home story time my best friend  slept with my boyfriend on my birthday  so a little background information i was
yF6WlkX5EB4,903440,910720,16 and a sophomore in high school well i  have this best friend who we're going to  call sarah her and i became super close
yF6WlkX5EB4,910720,917040,over the summer time but she was like on  and off best friends with this other  girl who we're gonna call mackenzie but
yF6WlkX5EB4,917040,923040,i have this boyfriend who i was also  really on and off with and sarah knew  about all the problems within our
yF6WlkX5EB4,923040,929120,relationship well i guess i  underestimated how close sarah and  mackenzie were because everything that i
yF6WlkX5EB4,929120,936079,told sarah she went back and she told  mackenzie and not to mention mackenzie  was really close with my boyfriend so of
yF6WlkX5EB4,936079,942399,course she told my boyfriend everything  that i was saying this ended up causing  a huge fight between my boyfriend and i
yF6WlkX5EB4,942399,949360,well the night before my birthday my  boyfriend and i were going back and  forth arguing and around 12 a.m on my
yF6WlkX5EB4,949360,956480,birthday i forced myself to fall asleep  and at around 1am i woke up to 20  snapchat notifications
yF6WlkX5EB4,956480,961600,all from my boyfriend and when i opened  them i saw the worst thing ever like for
yF6WlkX5EB4,961600,966639,part two  or two about how my best friend slept  with my boyfriend on my birthday so like
yF6WlkX5EB4,966639,971839,i said i woke up at around 1am to 20  snapchat notifications from my boyfriend
yF6WlkX5EB4,971839,978480,and i saw the absolute worst thing ever  the first five notifications were just  him calling me names and then all the
yF6WlkX5EB4,978480,984800,other ones were just him doing stuff  with my best friend and you guys can  already guess what i mean by doing stuff
yF6WlkX5EB4,984800,990800,so at this point i was heartbroken i was  pissed off but of course because i gotta  have the receipts i went and took a
yF6WlkX5EB4,990800,996399,video off my sister's phone of  everything that he sent me in the  morning i woke up to a text from an
yF6WlkX5EB4,996399,1003360,unknown number and it turned out to be  my boyfriend's best friend saying that  him and sarah were now together so my
yF6WlkX5EB4,1003360,1009440,boyfriend asked me to meet up and  apologize so i met him at this park and  he apologized to me telling me that he
yF6WlkX5EB4,1009440,1015279,wanted to get back together with me but  i told him to kma and i left then sarah
yF6WlkX5EB4,1015279,1021519,came to my house and keyed my car  and then we fought on my front lawn and  then after that she was texting me about
yF6WlkX5EB4,1021519,1027120,how she was coming back to my house like  for part three  three about how my best friend slept
yF6WlkX5EB4,1027120,1034558,with my boyfriend so like i said she  came to my house and she keyed my car  and i caught her so i went outside we
yF6WlkX5EB4,1034558,1040079,fought on my front lawn after she left  she kept sending me messages saying that  she was coming back to my house so we
yF6WlkX5EB4,1040079,1046798,could fight again but she was blocked so  i didn't get any of the messages and  then my ex came to my house and brought
yF6WlkX5EB4,1046798,1053679,me flowers and this was all in a span of  one day so because it was my birthday  party my cousins were at my house and i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1053679,1060160,already told them everything that  happened so they went outside and they  fought him well then i ended up sending
yF6WlkX5EB4,1060160,1067280,all the videos to his parents her  parents his siblings aunts uncles  cousins who loved me then i also decided
yF6WlkX5EB4,1067280,1073760,to take legal action and i sent the cops  all the screenshots of sarah harassing  me and my sister got a video of us
yF6WlkX5EB4,1073760,1080320,fighting so i sent that to them too well  since she was 18 and i literally just  turned 16 she got three months in county
yF6WlkX5EB4,1080320,1087200,jail for minor harassment and minor  physical altercations  so in the end i think i won
yF6WlkX5EB4,1087200,1093280,story time about how my best friend set  me up to get cheated on so a little  background information i was 16 and in
yF6WlkX5EB4,1093280,1099840,11th grade and i went to a very strict  boarding school i was best friends with  this girl who we're gonna call emma and
yF6WlkX5EB4,1099840,1106640,we were the closest out of our whole  friend group  our boarding school also had a building  for all the boys but it was like a mile
yF6WlkX5EB4,1106640,1112559,or two away from our building well the  days that we had off the juniors and  seniors were allowed to go visit each
yF6WlkX5EB4,1112559,1118640,other's campuses well a couple of the  senior boys put together a little  celebration before the first day of
yF6WlkX5EB4,1118640,1125360,school so my friends and i got ready we  went to the party and my friend emma  pointed out this one group of guys so we
yF6WlkX5EB4,1125360,1131360,went over there they were all super nice  but i hit things off with this kid who  we're gonna call ethan we exchanged
yF6WlkX5EB4,1131360,1137600,numbers well when we got back to the  dorm i told emma about ethan and she was  like being super weird she was like ew
yF6WlkX5EB4,1137600,1144160,you shouldn't date him he's really suss  i would have thought that she wished  that she got with ethan but she hit it
yF6WlkX5EB4,1144160,1150960,off with one of the guys from the same  friend group so ethan and i end up  dating and emma did not like that like
yF6WlkX5EB4,1150960,1157679,part three  part two about how my best friend set me  up to get cheated on so like i said  sooner or later ethan and i started
yF6WlkX5EB4,1157679,1164559,dating and emma did not like that and  ethan was honestly the best boyfriend  ever never saw any red flags or anything
yF6WlkX5EB4,1164559,1171039,like that so fast forward ethan and i  have been dating for four months well  winter break rolled around and you had a
yF6WlkX5EB4,1171039,1176559,choice to just take the day off or you  could stay and help the school clean up  and stuff like that so ethan and i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1176559,1182000,decided to go help at the school and he  was just acting super different it  wasn't like cheating or anything like
yF6WlkX5EB4,1182000,1187120,that but something was off like he would  tell me to go through his phone but the  weird thing was is he always deleted his
yF6WlkX5EB4,1187120,1193360,messages with emma well the one day emma  sends me a video of ethan making out  with some girl so i broke up with ethan
yF6WlkX5EB4,1193360,1199360,he said it wasn't his fault but he  couldn't tell me why well a month goes  by and one of the other girls in our  friend group says that she has to tell
yF6WlkX5EB4,1199360,1205440,me something apparently she went through  emma and ethan's conversations and emma  was blackmailing him with a video of him
yF6WlkX5EB4,1205440,1210960,destroying school property she said that  she was sent to the school if he didn't  send her proof of him cheating on me now
yF6WlkX5EB4,1210960,1216240,ethan and i have been dating for two  years and emma still tries to reach out  but everyone in our friend group cut her
yF6WlkX5EB4,1216240,1222320,off story time about how i saw my  boyfriend propose to another girl in  front of me so a little background
yF6WlkX5EB4,1222320,1229760,information at the time my boyfriend and  i had been together for around four  years we had two kids together and our
yF6WlkX5EB4,1229760,1237039,relationship was pretty rocky within the  first year of us dating he would cheat  on me all the time and both times that i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1237039,1243760,was pregnant he would cheat on me also  now after i popped out the second kid  our relationship was going pretty well
yF6WlkX5EB4,1243760,1249039,and if you're wondering why i didn't  leave him when he was cheating on me all  the time well it was mainly because i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1249039,1255120,grew up in a broken home and remembering  how hard it was on me whenever my  parents broke up i didn't want that for
yF6WlkX5EB4,1255120,1261039,them well over the past few months my  boyfriend had been traveling all over  the country with his dad going to
yF6WlkX5EB4,1261039,1266240,meetings and stuff because he was  getting ready to take over half the  company well fast forward it's a
yF6WlkX5EB4,1266240,1271360,thursday and my boyfriend has a meeting  with some associates who flew in from
yF6WlkX5EB4,1271360,1277280,out of state and later that night we  were supposed to get on a flight with  our friends to go to the bahamas like
yF6WlkX5EB4,1277280,1282559,for part two  part two about how my boyfriend  literally proposed to another girl right
yF6WlkX5EB4,1282559,1288000,in front of me so like i said my  boyfriend had a meeting with some  associates who flew in from out of town
yF6WlkX5EB4,1288000,1293600,and that night we were supposed to be on  a plane to the bahamas with our friends  so while he was getting ready for this
yF6WlkX5EB4,1293600,1299840,meeting i went and i dropped the kids  off early and he went to this meeting  and i drove our luggage over to our
yF6WlkX5EB4,1299840,1305200,friend's house because they were just  gonna drive us to the airport so my  girlfriend and i are super pumped to go
yF6WlkX5EB4,1305200,1311280,on this trip so we decided to start  drinking early and we went somewhere to  get drinks she suggests this high-end
yF6WlkX5EB4,1311280,1316960,place because the guy at the bar has a  crush on her and always gives her free  drinks so we're sitting there having a
yF6WlkX5EB4,1316960,1324480,really good time drinking at the bar so  while we're sitting there we hear a  bunch of clapping and cheering coming  from outside so us being drunk and nosy
yF6WlkX5EB4,1324480,1329840,we go out there to see what's going on  and one of the chances i walk out there  my boyfriend is down on one knee in
yF6WlkX5EB4,1329840,1335440,front of another girl and i'm not very  confrontational whenever i drink so i  told my best friend to just take me back
yF6WlkX5EB4,1335440,1341120,to her house when we got back it was  around 6 p.m and my boyfriend tells me  that he's just gonna meet us at the
yF6WlkX5EB4,1341120,1346559,airport like for part three  part three about how my boyfriend  proposed to another girl right in front
yF6WlkX5EB4,1346559,1353360,of me i know this is late but better  late than never so like i said we left i  went back to her house and my boyfriend
yF6WlkX5EB4,1353360,1358880,has the audacity to text me i'll just  meet you guys at the airport so my best  friend's like what do you want to do do
yF6WlkX5EB4,1358880,1364640,you wanna go beat em up of course i said  no so i told her and her boyfriend to  just go to the airport while i figured
yF6WlkX5EB4,1364640,1371280,out what i was gonna do and to not say a  word which was hard for my best friend  because she was confrontational as
yF6WlkX5EB4,1371280,1376559,so i texted my boyfriend saying that i  was sick and i just wasn't gonna go to  the bahamas with them when in reality i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1376559,1382799,was packing up our whole house leaving  him with only his clothes and his shoes  so i put all the stuff in storage and i
yF6WlkX5EB4,1382799,1388799,just decided to move back to my mom's  house and yes this was in a span of a  few days so the whole time that he was
yF6WlkX5EB4,1388799,1395440,gone i was acting like everything was  okay on the last day of the trip i sent  him a text saying that i knew about  everything and i said i never wanted to
yF6WlkX5EB4,1395440,1400960,hear from him again and i never wanted  him to see the kids again and he took  that quite literally i never got a text
yF6WlkX5EB4,1400960,1406799,back well four months after all this  happened i soon find out that he got a  new house in north carolina with his new
yF6WlkX5EB4,1406799,1413120,wife and they have a daughter on the way  alex post is titled my husband's boss

yF6WlkX5EB4,1460080,1465840,credit cards for charges today might  give some clues  while you're at it check the mileage on

yF6WlkX5EB4,1484480,1491120,tipping off the wife that's how i would  have done it boss is absolved of messing  with employees life because of course
yF6WlkX5EB4,1491120,1496320,they assumed wife knows about those days  off  well it's either a long-term affair or
yF6WlkX5EB4,1496320,1502559,he's taking a class to surprise you i  wouldn't say a single damned word just  start taking measures to protect your
yF6WlkX5EB4,1502559,1508880,ability to have a roof over your head  and a livelihood if it's an affair or  decide if you want to put up with it no
yF6WlkX5EB4,1508880,1515440,matter what if your birthday anniversary  and christmas go by with a status quo  you'll know what to do don't assume
yF6WlkX5EB4,1515440,1522640,infidelity gives any edge in custody do  you live near a casino my mother's  second husband got busted exactly like
yF6WlkX5EB4,1522640,1528880,this and it turned out he had a bit of a  gambling addiction my mom called him at  his office and the receptionist was like
yF6WlkX5EB4,1528880,1534400,um lady isn't he homesick in bed  also maybe check your attic or closets
yF6WlkX5EB4,1534400,1541440,you never look in for lots of stolen  office equipment  and now on to the update
yF6WlkX5EB4,1541440,1548320,he goes to visit his brother every  thursday in a state penitentiary he was  ashamed to tell me he was in there
yF6WlkX5EB4,1548320,1554880,edit to add this is verified he is  telling the truth and i'm not going to  put why his brother is in jail or the
yF6WlkX5EB4,1554880,1560559,length of his sentence  thank you all for your kind words to  everyone who reached out with comments
yF6WlkX5EB4,1560559,1565679,messages and awards you were all lovely  this was scary for me thank you for the
yF6WlkX5EB4,1565679,1571919,moral support  and copying for a comment for context on  why he wasn't open about this my
yF6WlkX5EB4,1571919,1576960,husband's grandfather spent time in jail  his father as well a long time ago in
yF6WlkX5EB4,1576960,1583360,his youth my husband was worried with  his brother there as well i was going to  think it was an inevitability that he
yF6WlkX5EB4,1583360,1589200,would wind up there too  in my husband's mind he didn't want me  to know that he comes from an entire
yF6WlkX5EB4,1589200,1594960,family of what he calls broken men  and now in the comments that also
yF6WlkX5EB4,1594960,1600880,explains why the phone was off i'm glad  it was a lot better of an outcome than  what most had thought
yF6WlkX5EB4,1600880,1606960,i just can't believe it was something as  left field as this  everyone in the original post was  gritting their teeth for the usual
yF6WlkX5EB4,1606960,1614480,cheating outcome i'm almost relieved  it's not that how do you feel about his  reason seems legitimate to me and i let
yF6WlkX5EB4,1614480,1620480,out an oh thank goodness sai when i read  the update  great news everyone turns out his
yF6WlkX5EB4,1620480,1625600,brother is a felon huge relief  seriously though happy to hear there is
yF6WlkX5EB4,1625600,1632400,an innocent explanation relatively  kind of reminds me of the one where the  wife found a long hair in the shower the
yF6WlkX5EB4,1632400,1638960,husband led a homeless friend who had  long hair shower there and kept it quiet  because he didn't want to out his friend
yF6WlkX5EB4,1638960,1645919,is homeless reminds me of an episode of  malcolm in the middle some boss at hal's  workplace are cooking the books and when
yF6WlkX5EB4,1645919,1652240,their diddle is discovered they try to  blame their embezzlement on poor hal  but he's able to prove he didn't log the
yF6WlkX5EB4,1652240,1658720,phony bookkeeping entries because they  always happened on fridays and he'd be  skipping out work on fridays for years
yF6WlkX5EB4,1658720,1666240,and he presents as evidence a cigar box  full of dated amusement park and movie  tickets to prove his regular absences on
yF6WlkX5EB4,1666240,1671279,all the days the embezzlements actually  happened at the conclusion hal is very
yF6WlkX5EB4,1671279,1678320,proud of himself but lois is furious  with him because she's been slaving away  at lucky mart clipping coupons and
yF6WlkX5EB4,1678320,1685760,washing out used paper towels in order  to make the family's financial ends meet  while all the while every friday hal had
yF6WlkX5EB4,1685760,1694840,secretly been blowing a bundle on  himself going to movie matinees playing  skee-ball and riding roller coasters
yF6WlkX5EB4,1697440,1704030,give me  [Applause]
yF6WlkX5EB4,1710000,1728089,um  [Music]
yF6WlkX5EB4,1732530,1739200,[Music]  am i the for lashing out on my  boyfriend after he insulted my parents
yF6WlkX5EB4,1739200,1744320,because they kept asking about his  divorced parents i 20 female meant my
yF6WlkX5EB4,1744320,1749520,boyfriend 20 male in high school but we  both started dating nine months ago
yF6WlkX5EB4,1749520,1756000,he's a good guy calm and rarely gets  angry  his parents aren't the best when he was
yF6WlkX5EB4,1756000,1763279,a kid they were always busy with work so  he used to be left with his grandma and  whenever they were together they fought
yF6WlkX5EB4,1763279,1770080,when my boyfriend was 17 his mum caught  his dad cheating and that's when the  divorce was finalized he doesn't like to
yF6WlkX5EB4,1770080,1777360,talk about his parents  my parents on the other hand are happy  together  so about one month ago my boyfriend met
yF6WlkX5EB4,1777360,1783039,my parents for the first time  my parents are the old school type they  think that divorce is selfish and it
yF6WlkX5EB4,1783039,1790480,destroys relationships and your image in  society so it went well until the topic  of his divorced parents was brought up
yF6WlkX5EB4,1790480,1797440,my parents were surprised so they kept  asking more like why did the divorce  happen how did he feel when the divorce
yF6WlkX5EB4,1797440,1803200,happened why didn't he stop them etc  now i know this was wrong so i tried to
yF6WlkX5EB4,1803200,1808799,stop them from asking about his parents  but they didn't  at the end they said they want to meet
yF6WlkX5EB4,1808799,1816159,my boyfriend's parents only because they  want to be more close with the family  he agreed after a lot of hesitation
yF6WlkX5EB4,1816159,1822880,a few days later me my parents my  boyfriend and his divorced parents were  sitting together having dinner
yF6WlkX5EB4,1822880,1829520,the atmosphere was so tense that i  already started regretting this  halfway into the dinner and his parents
yF6WlkX5EB4,1829520,1836399,started arguing probably because of some  talk of divorce was brought up and they  were busy blaming each other
yF6WlkX5EB4,1836399,1842720,at that point my boyfriend visibly  looked like he was about to lose it so  instead of saying anything he just got
yF6WlkX5EB4,1842720,1849200,up with me following him as i wanted to  apologize  the minute i started apologizing to him
yF6WlkX5EB4,1849200,1855120,he lashed out at me with saying things  like you know the condition between my  parents right yet you didn't stop your
yF6WlkX5EB4,1855120,1862320,parents from organizing all of this etc  i took all of the remarks that he was  throwing at me but then he brought up my
yF6WlkX5EB4,1862320,1867519,parents and said your parents are just  like you nosy don't they understand that
yF6WlkX5EB4,1867519,1874000,not all couples have a fairy tale story  like them even in that first meeting  they kept on asking me about my parents
yF6WlkX5EB4,1874000,1880559,don't they have anything better to do  than prying on others lives can't they  freaking stay out of my family matters
yF6WlkX5EB4,1880559,1886559,now i knew he was mad at my parents and  it was understandable but talking like  that about them was not acceptable for
yF6WlkX5EB4,1886559,1892640,me so i argued back by saying don't  speak like that about my parents they  just wanted to know more about their
yF6WlkX5EB4,1892640,1899200,only daughter's boyfriend it's not their  fault that your parents relationship is  effed up and after like 15 minutes of
yF6WlkX5EB4,1899200,1904320,arguing he left along with his parents  it's been almost two weeks since me and
yF6WlkX5EB4,1904320,1911519,my boyfriend have talked with each other  and now i'm starting to question whether  i was the wrong one  my parents say i did the right thing but
yF6WlkX5EB4,1911519,1917600,my friends say that i went a bit  overboard and now i'm confused i want to  know whether i was really the one at
yF6WlkX5EB4,1917600,1923679,fault  so reddit am i the  and edit i would like to add that this
yF6WlkX5EB4,1923679,1930480,guy is my first boyfriend ever and i am  very open with my parents  i.e they know everything about me so
yF6WlkX5EB4,1930480,1936799,they would obviously like to meet my  first boyfriend and his family i am his  girlfriend too and his parents also
yF6WlkX5EB4,1936799,1943679,agreed for the dinner they said that  they would love to meet their son's  first girlfriend and her family
yF6WlkX5EB4,1943679,1950080,they hate each other but not their son  so all the people who think that the  parents forced the other party to come
yF6WlkX5EB4,1950080,1955360,no they didn't it was a mutual decision  op has offered the following explanation
yF6WlkX5EB4,1955360,1961200,for why they think they might be the    i feel like i might be the  because instead of talking calmly with
yF6WlkX5EB4,1961200,1966960,my boyfriend i lashed out at him which  just made the matters worse and now in  the comments
yF6WlkX5EB4,1966960,1973679,you're the your parents were out  of line and you took their side your  boyfriend is correct about your parents
yF6WlkX5EB4,1973679,1980000,how the hell was your boyfriend supposed  to stop his parents divorce your parents  are also out of touch with reality
yF6WlkX5EB4,1980000,1986640,you're the your parents were  rude and invasive and you allowed it to  happen despite knowing how he felt and
yF6WlkX5EB4,1986640,1992880,then berated him when he got predictably  very upset with you  lol wtf
yF6WlkX5EB4,1992880,1999279,you're the for defending your  parents's behavior it's one thing to say  please don't swear at me i can't control
yF6WlkX5EB4,1999279,2006559,them but you are actually defending them  his parents's divorce is no one's  business your parents are rude and an
yF6WlkX5EB4,2006559,2013840,embarrassment and deserve to be cut off  by boyfriend and his family  everyone sucks here i don't understand
yF6WlkX5EB4,2013840,2019360,why you and your boyfriend allow this to  happen  no is a complete sentence
yF6WlkX5EB4,2019360,2026320,you're the how is this a  question there isn't any trying to stop  your parents from asking questions how
yF6WlkX5EB4,2026320,2034159,about this hey guys it's not your  business and the topic is obviously  making boyfriend uncomfortable so stop
yF6WlkX5EB4,2034159,2040320,there was nothing wrong with them trying  to get to know him but that's not what  they were doing  they were sticking their nose in another
yF6WlkX5EB4,2040320,2046159,family's business  you are lucky your boyfriend is as calm  as he is  my response at the first dinner would
yF6WlkX5EB4,2046159,2053118,have been my parents relationship is  none of your business stop asking about  it like it is and if i caught any lip
yF6WlkX5EB4,2053118,2060638,about it i would have left without  another word your family needs  boundaries also abso effing lutely
yF6WlkX5EB4,2060638,2067919,insane that you all thought that it was  a great idea to have a divorced couple  over for dinner yeah what could go wrong
yF6WlkX5EB4,2067919,2074878,right  also you're right it isn't your fault  his parents are divorced it is your  fault you're a shitty partner and you
yF6WlkX5EB4,2074878,2094770,actively made the whole situation worse  for him good job  [Music]
yF6WlkX5EB4,2096870,2122239,[Music]
yF6WlkX5EB4,2125359,2130400,and now on to the update hi everyone  it's been a week since i made that post
yF6WlkX5EB4,2130400,2136720,and i've been recently getting messages  asking me about what i did next so here  is an update
yF6WlkX5EB4,2136720,2143119,since two weeks i was busy with college  events so i didn't get time to call him  but after i made that post and read
yF6WlkX5EB4,2143119,2148640,every comment i started realizing how  wrong i was  i felt horrible for not understanding
yF6WlkX5EB4,2148640,2154880,myself that i was the wrong one  i decided that now i have to meet him to  apologize so i called and requested that
yF6WlkX5EB4,2154880,2160720,i needed to see him  he just said okay and we met at a cafe  that evening
yF6WlkX5EB4,2160720,2167200,when he arrived he just had a blank face  which made me realize that things will  never be the same for us
yF6WlkX5EB4,2167200,2173760,i apologize to him for everything for  not stopping my parents from asking  questions about his parents for letting
yF6WlkX5EB4,2173760,2179599,them organize that dinner for lashing  out at him and for not apologizing  earlier
yF6WlkX5EB4,2179599,2186480,also i felt like after this his feelings  for me must have changed and as some of  you said i realized that i may not be
yF6WlkX5EB4,2186480,2191520,the one for him and he deserved a better  girl who could understand him more  clearly
yF6WlkX5EB4,2191520,2198240,so i added that if he now hates me and  wants to break up then it's okay  he finally spoke and admitted that what
yF6WlkX5EB4,2198240,2204720,i said did hurt him he said that he  didn't like talking about his parents  but he didn't say that to my parents
yF6WlkX5EB4,2204720,2210720,because he wanted them to have a good  impression of him  he thought i would understand him but i  didn't
yF6WlkX5EB4,2210720,2217680,he also apologized for yelling at me  at the end he confessed that he doesn't  hate me but the love that he had for me
yF6WlkX5EB4,2217680,2223760,has decreased and that if we continue  being together it would only hurt me  because i still loved him but he
yF6WlkX5EB4,2223760,2230880,wouldn't be able to return the same love  back  and he didn't want that  to be honest that sentence did hurt me
yF6WlkX5EB4,2230880,2237920,because i still love him and had a tiny  hope that we would still be together  sorry i know this is selfish but
yF6WlkX5EB4,2237920,2245520,breaking up with him was the last thing  i could do after all the pain he  suffered because of me  so yep we officially broke up
yF6WlkX5EB4,2245520,2251760,he said that we can still remain in  contact but i hope we don't  i also confronted my parents and told
yF6WlkX5EB4,2251760,2257440,them what they did was extremely  insensitive but they said that as  parents it is their right to know
yF6WlkX5EB4,2257440,2264320,everything about their child's partner  and that it's good that we broke up  because since he came from such a  troubled family they were worried that
yF6WlkX5EB4,2264320,2271040,the same would happen with me if we both  get married i was bewildered because i  didn't expect my parents to think like
yF6WlkX5EB4,2271040,2277040,that  i told them that if they continue this  behavior i would stop introducing anyone  to them
yF6WlkX5EB4,2277040,2283599,they were angry but agreed  so yep that's it  i also want to thank all the redditors
yF6WlkX5EB4,2283599,2290640,who were honest about how wrong my  actions were i am truly thankful to all  of you as it made me understand my fault
yF6WlkX5EB4,2290640,2295760,and i will try my best to improve myself  i also hope that my now ex-boyfriend
yF6WlkX5EB4,2295760,2301200,finds a girl who would understand him  better and he stays happy  thank you
yF6WlkX5EB4,2301200,2306400,and now in the comments shocked pikachu  face you took two weeks to call him and
yF6WlkX5EB4,2306400,2313280,you apparently love him clearly not as  much as you think you do  yes you're right if she really loved him
yF6WlkX5EB4,2313280,2319040,and wanted to make up she would have  made time  this is what i took from this if she had
yF6WlkX5EB4,2319040,2324960,called that day maybe she'd be able to  fix things apparently her boyfriend  wasn't important enough to call right
yF6WlkX5EB4,2324960,2330400,away opie is not ready for a  relationship  you should probably re-evaluate your
yF6WlkX5EB4,2330400,2336480,relationship with your parents  especially the relation to your personal  life and how much about it they know
yF6WlkX5EB4,2336480,2342160,otherwise this or something worse will  happen opie i think you've taken a real
yF6WlkX5EB4,2342160,2348079,lesson from all of this and that is to  be applauded a ton of other people would  have dug in and argued about why they
yF6WlkX5EB4,2348079,2355520,were right and the rest of the world was  delusional but you read the comments and  took it in and you had real growth
yF6WlkX5EB4,2355520,2362320,i know it's not the outcome you wanted  but to be honest this was a valuable  experience you saw firsthand how your
yF6WlkX5EB4,2362320,2367599,parents treated your significant other  and how your significant other's  boundaries were not respected in the
yF6WlkX5EB4,2367599,2374240,name of protecting you  hopefully this is a wake-up call for you  that your parents suck i like the part
yF6WlkX5EB4,2374240,2379839,where her parents think that he is the  one with a troubled family their ability  to respect boundaries and not pass
yF6WlkX5EB4,2379839,2386800,judgment is non-existent they are so  smug and just over the top with their  intrusive and unwelcome examination of
yF6WlkX5EB4,2386800,2393520,guests  and also since the parents believe you  shouldn't get divorced because your  social reputation will take a hit i
yF6WlkX5EB4,2393520,2399440,wonder at the state of their own  marriage we can't be sure that it's  happy fairy tale days better to be
yF6WlkX5EB4,2399440,2404960,happily divorced than unhappily married  why didn't he stop them divorcing what
yF6WlkX5EB4,2404960,2410160,was he supposed to do steal the  paperwork  no he was supposed to find his long-lost
yF6WlkX5EB4,2410160,2415680,twin at summer camp and set up an  elaborate rose to make his parents  realize the love they've always had for
yF6WlkX5EB4,2415680,2422160,each other  wow opie your parents must be fun at  parties  hi nice to meet you for the very first
yF6WlkX5EB4,2422160,2428000,time do you have any trauma you don't  want to talk about  excellent let's talk about it let's pass
yF6WlkX5EB4,2428000,2433200,every freaking detail until you hate us  and it literally destroys relationships
yF6WlkX5EB4,2433200,2439040,this will be the topic of conversation  for the next three hours or until you  have a panic attack whichever comes
yF6WlkX5EB4,2439040,2444400,second unexposed is titled poisoned at  family dinner
yF6WlkX5EB4,2444400,2452000,i'm currently on vacation visiting  family for christmas i'm 20 female a  vegan by choice however i am allergic to
yF6WlkX5EB4,2452000,2458160,red meat  i was bitten by a lone star tick which  caused me to develop a severe allergy to
yF6WlkX5EB4,2458160,2465760,meat  my family makes fun of me for being  vegan though i cook for myself for all  meals and i don't mention it much at all
yF6WlkX5EB4,2465760,2471359,anyway i guess some of my extended  family didn't know the severity of my  allergy because my younger cousin
yF6WlkX5EB4,2471359,2476400,chopped up some steak extremely finely i  guess and put it in my butternut squash
yF6WlkX5EB4,2476400,2481440,soup  shortly after i ate some of my soup i  couldn't breathe and was breaking out in
yF6WlkX5EB4,2481440,2486800,hives  i woke up in the hospital on christmas  day my mom called an ambulance when she
yF6WlkX5EB4,2486800,2493520,saw my face was swelling my cousin  didn't say sorry when i started breaking  out in hives he started laughing and
yF6WlkX5EB4,2493520,2500480,told me what he had done  i woke up to a text of him saying stop  overreacting you need protein with a
yF6WlkX5EB4,2500480,2507119,picture of a slaughtered cow  his parents aren't very well off in fact  i don't think they even have insurance
yF6WlkX5EB4,2507119,2514640,i just want to know should i pursue a  legal case or is that an overreaction  and now in the comments that text is
yF6WlkX5EB4,2514640,2520319,essentially a confession and it doesn't  do anything to create the impression  that he didn't know the severity
yF6WlkX5EB4,2520319,2528160,it may be red as him accusing you of  exaggerating it  you have medical evidence that that  isn't true so let the police sort it out
yF6WlkX5EB4,2528160,2533440,he has more than earned the hassle  have you considered filing a police  report
yF6WlkX5EB4,2533440,2538560,and op says it hasn't really crossed my  mind my boyfriend told me to post here
yF6WlkX5EB4,2538560,2544480,for advice  i just don't want to tear my family  apart  you can legally record phone calls
yF6WlkX5EB4,2544480,2549520,without the other party's permission in  nebraska but not in-person conversations
yF6WlkX5EB4,2549520,2554880,i would ring up and get them to confess  and ask them to reimburse you anything  you have to pay out of pocket for the
yF6WlkX5EB4,2554880,2560560,hospital stay  you said they don't have much tell them  to sell your cousin's belongings to pay
yF6WlkX5EB4,2560560,2566880,if they can scrounge the cash off  sending you messages like that after you  were taken to hospital unconscious shows
yF6WlkX5EB4,2566880,2571920,the kid needs to be taught how serious  it was you literally could have died
yF6WlkX5EB4,2571920,2578560,imagine if you went to the toilet and no  one noticed you were gone for 30 minutes  make a police report as well get a
yF6WlkX5EB4,2578560,2584560,reference number for it so you have a  record of it people that stupid will  probably try again to prove that you
yF6WlkX5EB4,2584560,2591040,somehow faked a medical emergency  you were not tearing the family apart  you were making an idiot face the
yF6WlkX5EB4,2591040,2598319,repercussions for almost killing you  probably because of the idiocy his  parents fed him about you being vegan
yF6WlkX5EB4,2598319,2604560,and opie says you're right he does need  to be taught a lesson but i don't want  him to go to jail or have this on his
yF6WlkX5EB4,2604560,2611200,record permanently if his parents have  homeowners or renters insurance their  liability coverage may take care of your
yF6WlkX5EB4,2611200,2617359,bills you would have to show that your  cousin knew or should have known that  you were allergic to meat and knowingly
yF6WlkX5EB4,2617359,2624000,deceived you  it's not clear from your narrative if  that's the case  also the insurance wouldn't cover you if
yF6WlkX5EB4,2624000,2631040,your cousin intentionally did this  did you previously inform the cousin or  the owner of the kitchen in use in
yF6WlkX5EB4,2631040,2637839,writing that you had this allergy was  this soup made for you or did you  prepare it yourself and walk away
yF6WlkX5EB4,2637839,2645520,lastly do you have medical bills because  of this that were not covered by  insurance  and op says yes everyone in the family
yF6WlkX5EB4,2645520,2651440,knows i have a meat allergy i just don't  think he thought that it was very  serious or he thought that i was just an
yF6WlkX5EB4,2651440,2656640,annoying vegan pretending to be allergic  to meat i'm honestly not sure
yF6WlkX5EB4,2656640,2664000,i prepared my soup the day before and i  just heated it in the microwave i put it  in the microwave and took it out myself
yF6WlkX5EB4,2664000,2671359,i turned around for one second to get  water and returned to the dinner table  to eat my soup with my family
yF6WlkX5EB4,2671440,2677839,and now on to the update  hey guys i first just want to thank you  all for the support regarding my last
yF6WlkX5EB4,2677839,2684800,post i've had a free consultation with a  personal injury lawyer and have filed a  police report like many of you suggested
yF6WlkX5EB4,2684800,2691920,i let my cousin aunt and uncle know this  and they immediately ended up offering  to pay my hospital bill and ambulance
yF6WlkX5EB4,2691920,2697680,ride in full  my cousin gave me a half-hearted apology  and his parents told me they won't be
yF6WlkX5EB4,2697680,2704960,leaving the house for the next year and  will be severely punished for this  i have decided not to press charges i
yF6WlkX5EB4,2704960,2710079,don't really have the money or time for  it and all i needed was my medical  expenses paid
yF6WlkX5EB4,2710079,2715119,i just plan on not going to any family  gatherings where he is for a long long  long
yF6WlkX5EB4,2715119,2720960,time  thanks again for all the love and  support  and now in the comments
yF6WlkX5EB4,2720960,2727680,what is it with people who don't believe  in allergies who thinks giving an  allergic person the food they can't eat
yF6WlkX5EB4,2727680,2732880,is somehow good for them  i can't fathom this at all and edit
yF6WlkX5EB4,2732880,2740240,personally i have a bunch of allergies  too  but with food i really just have  intolerances to both dairy and eggs i
yF6WlkX5EB4,2740240,2746880,just say i'm allergic because it's  easier  also since so many people are telling  crazy stories about their allergies
yF6WlkX5EB4,2746880,2753440,once a girl sat next to me wearing a  fuzzy sweater and within 10 minutes my  eyes were red and i was sneezing
yF6WlkX5EB4,2753440,2758800,uncontrollably  i didn't even touch her clothes but she  had to take the sweater off and put it
yF6WlkX5EB4,2758800,2765920,away  that was when i found out i was allergic  to mohair  people like this are baffling to me
yF6WlkX5EB4,2765920,2772079,my grandma is 87 i just mentioned to her  on the phone that i recently found out  that i'm allergic to almonds and she
yF6WlkX5EB4,2772079,2778480,thanked me for letting her know so that  she would avoid recipes with almonds  when i visit  it is that easy
yF6WlkX5EB4,2778480,2784240,she didn't need me to prove it she just  wanted a heads up so that there weren't  any uncomfortable incidents
yF6WlkX5EB4,2784240,2790720,and she accepted it because she loves me  and wants the best for me people who  test your allergies like that don't have
yF6WlkX5EB4,2790720,2796480,your best interests in mind and it's  best to cut them out  i'm glad that op's hospital bills are
yF6WlkX5EB4,2796480,2803838,being paid by his idiot cousin's family  good call to avoid that cousin in the  future
