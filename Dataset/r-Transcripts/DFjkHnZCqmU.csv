DFjkHnZCqmU,160,1680,so if the big game is coming up and you
DFjkHnZCqmU,1680,3120,didn't plan ahead you're probably due
DFjkHnZCqmU,3120,4960,for a mediocre spread so let me give you
DFjkHnZCqmU,4960,8520,a hand with that
DFjkHnZCqmU,10270,13369,[Music]
DFjkHnZCqmU,15640,17680,[Music]
DFjkHnZCqmU,17680,19840,okay so today we are making the most
DFjkHnZCqmU,19840,22480,ideal super bowl spread in my mind as
DFjkHnZCqmU,22480,24640,quickly as possible i understand that a
DFjkHnZCqmU,24640,26320,lot of the time it doesn't really make a
DFjkHnZCqmU,26320,28560,lot of sense to pre-prep a ton of
DFjkHnZCqmU,28560,29840,ingredients and a ton of different
DFjkHnZCqmU,29840,31760,recipes just for one super bowl party so
DFjkHnZCqmU,31760,32640,i thought you know there should be a
DFjkHnZCqmU,32640,34320,version making this quickly but it's
DFjkHnZCqmU,34320,36000,still actually good with homemade
DFjkHnZCqmU,36000,37120,ingredients none of the store-bought
DFjkHnZCqmU,37120,38079,stuff where you're going to the store
DFjkHnZCqmU,38079,39760,and getting these huge platters of
DFjkHnZCqmU,39760,41120,cheese that have all been sliced and
DFjkHnZCqmU,41120,43600,sitting there for 14 days disco so we're
DFjkHnZCqmU,43600,45039,gonna put three hours on the clock and
DFjkHnZCqmU,45039,46399,see if we can make this entire thing in
DFjkHnZCqmU,46399,48239,that amount of time so let's make this
DFjkHnZCqmU,48239,50559,shall we we can easily do this in three
DFjkHnZCqmU,50559,52320,hours then i'll be your shepherd so keep
DFjkHnZCqmU,52320,54559,it clean orderly and move like you're in
DFjkHnZCqmU,54559,56320,a restaurant if you will garlic nuts
DFjkHnZCqmU,56320,58079,unbelievable wings chips with guac
DFjkHnZCqmU,58079,60719,homemade queso shabbata sando bites and
DFjkHnZCqmU,60719,63120,a luxurious cheese board so with that
DFjkHnZCqmU,63120,65198,let's get our time check set the clock
DFjkHnZCqmU,65198,67360,and begin one of our biggest bottlenecks
DFjkHnZCqmU,67360,68960,is the time that it takes to rise our
DFjkHnZCqmU,68960,70720,garlic knots so there's no question we
DFjkHnZCqmU,70720,72400,have to start there with one tablespoon
DFjkHnZCqmU,72400,74240,of 14 grams of instant yeast into one
DFjkHnZCqmU,74240,76159,and a quarter cup or 300 grams of water
