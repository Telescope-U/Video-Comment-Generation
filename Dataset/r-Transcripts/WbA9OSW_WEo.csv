WbA9OSW_WEo,160,1920,welcome to beat source tech my name is
WbA9OSW_WEo,1920,3919,mo jax and today we are looking at a
WbA9OSW_WEo,3919,6399,brand new analog rotary mixer this
WbA9OSW_WEo,6399,9120,always gets me excited but today i'm
WbA9OSW_WEo,9120,11679,double excited because this product
WbA9OSW_WEo,11679,14480,marks the return to the dj scene of a
WbA9OSW_WEo,14480,16160,company who've not been involved with it
WbA9OSW_WEo,16160,18800,for quite a long time we are looking at
WbA9OSW_WEo,18800,21110,the echola warm 2.
WbA9OSW_WEo,21110,24190,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,24240,26480,spanish manufacturer ekla began making
WbA9OSW_WEo,26480,29519,dj mixers in the 1970s and dropped some
WbA9OSW_WEo,29519,31920,highly memorable designs over the years
WbA9OSW_WEo,31920,34719,like the modular sklat series the mac
WbA9OSW_WEo,34719,37360,club mixers and the rather quirky smack
WbA9OSW_WEo,37360,39600,line with angled up faders viewers of
WbA9OSW_WEo,39600,41280,this channel might be more familiar with
WbA9OSW_WEo,41280,43680,the new line more on those later and the
WbA9OSW_WEo,43680,45520,hack battle mixers which are often
WbA9OSW_WEo,45520,47280,spoken of in hushed tones by
WbA9OSW_WEo,47280,49680,turntablists who are in the know back in
WbA9OSW_WEo,49680,51760,the day i often heard them described as
WbA9OSW_WEo,51760,53920,the reign of europe and that makes a lot
WbA9OSW_WEo,53920,55920,of sense they were built locally had
WbA9OSW_WEo,55920,58239,designs unlike anyone else's and were
WbA9OSW_WEo,58239,60160,well renowned for their sound quality
WbA9OSW_WEo,60160,62160,but after the last hack model was
WbA9OSW_WEo,62160,64400,released a whopping 13 years ago the
WbA9OSW_WEo,64400,66799,company pulled out of the dj market and
WbA9OSW_WEo,66799,68240,most thought that was the end of the
WbA9OSW_WEo,68240,71119,story but a new chapter has begun as
WbA9OSW_WEo,71119,72960,earlier this year eckler announced the
WbA9OSW_WEo,72960,75840,warm 2 a two-channel analog rotary mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,75840,78560,it sells for around 650 euros which
WbA9OSW_WEo,78560,81119,translates to around 730
WbA9OSW_WEo,81119,82560,and that means it isn't the cheapest
WbA9OSW_WEo,82560,84479,rotary on the market but it comes in
WbA9OSW_WEo,84479,86000,comfortably below the next most
WbA9OSW_WEo,86000,87759,affordable option the master sounds
WbA9OSW_WEo,87759,90079,radius 2 which clocks in at just over a
WbA9OSW_WEo,90079,92000,thousand dollars looking at the mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,92000,93920,itself you are clearly getting quite a
WbA9OSW_WEo,93920,96159,lot for your money construction is solid
WbA9OSW_WEo,96159,98079,metal all around for the cabinet with
WbA9OSW_WEo,98079,99759,different textures on the top and the
WbA9OSW_WEo,99759,101759,other panels which i like overall i
WbA9OSW_WEo,101759,103759,think the build is very solid indeed and
WbA9OSW_WEo,103759,105840,everything on there feels durable and
WbA9OSW_WEo,105840,107280,although i don't normally mention
WbA9OSW_WEo,107280,109280,warranties the fact that the warm 2 has
WbA9OSW_WEo,109280,111600,a 3 year one speaks volumes about their
WbA9OSW_WEo,111600,113439,confidence in the product it's also
WbA9OSW_WEo,113439,115200,still built in spain like their older
WbA9OSW_WEo,115200,117680,mixers were which is always nice to see
WbA9OSW_WEo,117680,119600,the wooden side panels are a very
WbA9OSW_WEo,119600,122000,popular aftermarket upgrade for rotary
WbA9OSW_WEo,122000,124159,heads so it's nice to see them fitted as
WbA9OSW_WEo,124159,126320,stock here although if like me you don't
WbA9OSW_WEo,126320,127759,find them to match your personal
WbA9OSW_WEo,127759,130239,aesthetic they are easily removed taking
WbA9OSW_WEo,130239,131840,them off will make the mixer even more
WbA9OSW_WEo,131840,133840,narrow and that is worth noting although
WbA9OSW_WEo,133840,135760,it's fairly long front to back the warm
WbA9OSW_WEo,135760,138239,2 really is remarkably skinny even with
WbA9OSW_WEo,138239,140319,the wood panels on this is handy from a
WbA9OSW_WEo,140319,142560,portability perspective for sure but i
WbA9OSW_WEo,142560,144480,didn't find myself feeling cramped there
WbA9OSW_WEo,144480,146560,is plenty of room to work with in terms
WbA9OSW_WEo,146560,149120,of measurements it's 18.5 centimeters
WbA9OSW_WEo,149120,152000,wide with the wood panels and 16.5
WbA9OSW_WEo,152000,153920,centimeters without not far off the
WbA9OSW_WEo,153920,156560,vestax 06 for reference we'll move on to
WbA9OSW_WEo,156560,158400,the controls which are perhaps a little
WbA9OSW_WEo,158400,160560,controversial the main rotary knobs and
WbA9OSW_WEo,160560,163120,the isolator feature alps blue velvet
WbA9OSW_WEo,163120,165360,pots a highly regarded classic choice
WbA9OSW_WEo,165360,167440,found on many high-end devices but the
WbA9OSW_WEo,167440,170480,rest of the pots the eqs etc are plastic
WbA9OSW_WEo,170480,172400,and this has rubbed a few people the
WbA9OSW_WEo,172400,174319,wrong way i've spoken to a couple of
WbA9OSW_WEo,174319,176080,warm two owners who feel that they just
WbA9OSW_WEo,176080,178159,have a little too much wobble and they
WbA9OSW_WEo,178159,180400,find it disconcerting now i've referred
WbA9OSW_WEo,180400,182480,to this a few times before but some
WbA9OSW_WEo,182480,184239,years ago i had a conversation with
WbA9OSW_WEo,184239,186319,rayne about the use of plastic pots and
WbA9OSW_WEo,186319,188159,they convinced me that there are some
WbA9OSW_WEo,188159,190319,sound engineering reasons to use them
WbA9OSW_WEo,190319,192319,for some applications i will always
WbA9OSW_WEo,192319,194560,prefer the feel of a solid metal pot
WbA9OSW_WEo,194560,196480,bolted to a face plate but that's not
WbA9OSW_WEo,196480,197760,really relevant when you're talking
WbA9OSW_WEo,197760,200080,about performance and so this is where i
WbA9OSW_WEo,200080,202560,want to bring my new 04 into the picture
WbA9OSW_WEo,202560,204720,i bought it already well used around
WbA9OSW_WEo,204720,207680,2008 and used it week in week out in a
WbA9OSW_WEo,207680,210159,very sweaty club for over two years at
WbA9OSW_WEo,210159,211920,the time i needed the midi functions
WbA9OSW_WEo,211920,214080,that it offered as you can see a decade
WbA9OSW_WEo,214080,216159,later it looks to be in a pretty sorry
WbA9OSW_WEo,216159,217840,state with half the screen printing
WbA9OSW_WEo,217840,220400,rubbed off but guess what it has very
WbA9OSW_WEo,220400,222480,similar plastic pots to the warm 2
WbA9OSW_WEo,222480,224720,mounted in the same way and they feel
WbA9OSW_WEo,224720,227040,virtually identical and after all this
WbA9OSW_WEo,227040,229599,time they all still work just fine so
WbA9OSW_WEo,229599,231599,whilst i completely understand that some
WbA9OSW_WEo,231599,233680,djs will put their hands on the warm two
WbA9OSW_WEo,233680,235439,and find the wobbly pots a bit
WbA9OSW_WEo,235439,237760,off-putting i'm confident in saying that
WbA9OSW_WEo,237760,240080,in functionality terms they are all good
WbA9OSW_WEo,240080,242480,and will last you very well this is just
WbA9OSW_WEo,242480,244720,how ekla do things as for the shape of
WbA9OSW_WEo,244720,247120,the knobs i wasn't enthused about trying
WbA9OSW_WEo,247120,249040,them thinking i wouldn't be a fan of the
WbA9OSW_WEo,249040,251360,skirted type found on the warm 2 but
WbA9OSW_WEo,251360,253439,actually in use i found them to be very
WbA9OSW_WEo,253439,255599,comfortable and now i'm completely sold
WbA9OSW_WEo,255599,257680,on them there are a surprising amount of
WbA9OSW_WEo,257680,259759,features crammed into the slimline warm
WbA9OSW_WEo,259759,261919,too some of which are quite unexpected
WbA9OSW_WEo,261919,263840,in a good way starting at the bottom we
WbA9OSW_WEo,263840,265600,have those blue velvet rotary level
WbA9OSW_WEo,265600,267520,controls which have the perfect smooth
WbA9OSW_WEo,267520,271820,gradual curve that you need on a rotary
WbA9OSW_WEo,271820,288960,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,288960,291120,next to those are the vu meters bright
WbA9OSW_WEo,291120,292960,and clear with precise markings they
WbA9OSW_WEo,292960,295120,work very well you have a stereo pair
WbA9OSW_WEo,295120,297199,for the mix output and a single one for
WbA9OSW_WEo,297199,299600,the pfl or q signal the way they're laid
WbA9OSW_WEo,299600,301600,out makes the mixer look a tiny bit
WbA9OSW_WEo,301600,303680,lopsided as they aren't centered in the
WbA9OSW_WEo,303680,305759,mixer but that's being really pedantic
WbA9OSW_WEo,305759,307840,and it doesn't impact anything above
WbA9OSW_WEo,307840,309520,that we have the isolator which i
WbA9OSW_WEo,309520,311600,absolutely love there is plenty of room
WbA9OSW_WEo,311600,313520,to tweak things with two hands at once
WbA9OSW_WEo,313520,315759,and the musicality of the isolator is
WbA9OSW_WEo,315759,318240,great with crossover points at 300 hertz
WbA9OSW_WEo,318240,320560,and four kilohertz it goes from a full
WbA9OSW_WEo,320560,323039,cut to a 12 db boost which isn't the
WbA9OSW_WEo,323039,325120,highest out there but still enough to do
WbA9OSW_WEo,325120,326800,damage if you aren't paying attention to
WbA9OSW_WEo,326800,329280,your levels so as with any isolator
WbA9OSW_WEo,329280,332850,approach with caution
WbA9OSW_WEo,332850,352589,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,356479,357720,is
WbA9OSW_WEo,357720,368639,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,369680,371440,jumping up to the eq on the two main
WbA9OSW_WEo,371440,373360,channels this is a great complement to
WbA9OSW_WEo,373360,375919,the isolator it goes from full kill to a
WbA9OSW_WEo,375919,378160,10 db boost on each frequency and the
WbA9OSW_WEo,378160,380080,crossover points are different so you
WbA9OSW_WEo,380080,381600,might find there are some tracks which
WbA9OSW_WEo,381600,383520,sound better when tweaked with the eq
WbA9OSW_WEo,383520,385680,instead of the isolator and i appreciate
WbA9OSW_WEo,385680,389350,having that extra option
WbA9OSW_WEo,389350,394350,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,401759,403840,we'll move on to channel three yes the
WbA9OSW_WEo,403840,406000,third channel on this two channel mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,406000,407919,it is more limited than the main two
WbA9OSW_WEo,407919,410240,only having bass and high eq and a small
WbA9OSW_WEo,410240,412400,rotary pot for volume but it is
WbA9OSW_WEo,412400,414560,functionally a full channel switchable
WbA9OSW_WEo,414560,416639,between mic and line and with its own
WbA9OSW_WEo,416639,418800,cue button there is only a balance jack
WbA9OSW_WEo,418800,421120,input for the mic rather than an xlr but
WbA9OSW_WEo,421120,423199,that's okay due to space constraints and
WbA9OSW_WEo,423199,425039,i was fascinated to find that the mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,425039,427199,ships with phantom power for condenser
WbA9OSW_WEo,427199,429360,microphones enabled that can be turned
WbA9OSW_WEo,429360,431440,off with some jumpers if needed but i
WbA9OSW_WEo,431440,433440,love that if you use the mixer for radio
WbA9OSW_WEo,433440,435120,or live streams then it's going to work
WbA9OSW_WEo,435120,437120,great with studio condenser mics out of
WbA9OSW_WEo,437120,439599,the box which is a rare thing on any dj
WbA9OSW_WEo,439599,441680,mixer there's also a really wide gain
WbA9OSW_WEo,441680,443039,range on the channel which means it
WbA9OSW_WEo,443039,444639,should work well with pretty much any
WbA9OSW_WEo,444639,447120,microphone or line level source heading
WbA9OSW_WEo,447120,448800,to the rear of the warm 2 we find the
WbA9OSW_WEo,448800,450639,rest of the connections a universal
WbA9OSW_WEo,450639,452800,power supply with an iec connector means
WbA9OSW_WEo,452800,454800,the mixer can be used worldwide there
WbA9OSW_WEo,454800,456800,are three outputs the master is on
WbA9OSW_WEo,456800,459120,balanced xlrs there's a booth output on
WbA9OSW_WEo,459120,461280,rcas with its own level control and a
WbA9OSW_WEo,461280,464000,record output also on rcas again with
WbA9OSW_WEo,464000,466240,space so limited i can understand the
WbA9OSW_WEo,466240,467759,lack of a balanced connection for the
WbA9OSW_WEo,467759,469759,booth although i would always prefer one
WbA9OSW_WEo,469759,471360,as with the jumpers for the phantom
WbA9OSW_WEo,471360,473039,power on the mic there are also some
WbA9OSW_WEo,473039,474879,more inside the mixer to adjust the
WbA9OSW_WEo,474879,476720,output levels for the master and booth
WbA9OSW_WEo,476720,478240,which is a nice bit of attention to
WbA9OSW_WEo,478240,480720,detail a running theme on this mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,480720,482479,aside from the mic jack everything else
WbA9OSW_WEo,482479,484560,is on rcas with the two inputs for each
WbA9OSW_WEo,484560,486319,main channel the line input for channel
WbA9OSW_WEo,486319,488720,three and the effects sending return ah
WbA9OSW_WEo,488720,491199,yes the effects send and return this is
WbA9OSW_WEo,491199,493120,really dope with the option on each
WbA9OSW_WEo,493120,495199,channel of pre and post fader routing
WbA9OSW_WEo,495199,497199,and a level knob which makes activating
WbA9OSW_WEo,497199,499440,effects much smoother than just using a
WbA9OSW_WEo,499440,501440,switch it's the same system here as
WbA9OSW_WEo,501440,503599,found on my old new 04 which i used
WbA9OSW_WEo,503599,506319,religiously with my efx 500 and it works
WbA9OSW_WEo,506319,508319,just as nicely here it's a useful
WbA9OSW_WEo,508319,510479,feature nicely executed and i'm
WbA9OSW_WEo,510479,514360,delighted with it
WbA9OSW_WEo,514830,520080,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,520080,523080,oh
WbA9OSW_WEo,524049,535680,[Music]
WbA9OSW_WEo,535680,537760,queuing is on point you have both sizes
WbA9OSW_WEo,537760,539760,of headphone jack a healthy output level
WbA9OSW_WEo,539760,541680,and a qmaster blend knob you can hear
WbA9OSW_WEo,541680,543360,the isolator and the mic through the
WbA9OSW_WEo,543360,545279,master q circuit too which isn't the
WbA9OSW_WEo,545279,547279,case on some competing products the only
WbA9OSW_WEo,547279,549200,thing missing is split q which could be
WbA9OSW_WEo,549200,551200,a stumbling block for some but otherwise
WbA9OSW_WEo,551200,553440,the queue system is all good so we come
WbA9OSW_WEo,553440,555279,to what will be for most buyers of the
WbA9OSW_WEo,555279,557600,warm 2 i suspect the most important
WbA9OSW_WEo,557600,559519,thing the sound and
WbA9OSW_WEo,559519,562480,it's really good like really good no
WbA9OSW_WEo,562480,564160,doubt some commenters will ask whether
WbA9OSW_WEo,564160,565760,it's on a level with the master sounds
WbA9OSW_WEo,565760,567519,and sadly i've just not had one of those
WbA9OSW_WEo,567519,569760,in hand for a long time now so i can't
WbA9OSW_WEo,569760,571760,say with confidence either way hopefully
WbA9OSW_WEo,571760,573040,one day i'll be able to get a bunch of
WbA9OSW_WEo,573040,574880,rotaries in the same room and do some a
WbA9OSW_WEo,574880,577200,b testing but i can say that whether on
WbA9OSW_WEo,577200,579440,studio monitors or sound systems i tried
WbA9OSW_WEo,579440,582000,at venues the warm 2 really lives up to
WbA9OSW_WEo,582000,584560,its name well-rounded punchy analog
WbA9OSW_WEo,584560,586399,sound loads of low end and lots of
WbA9OSW_WEo,586399,588880,clarity in the top end with no harshness
WbA9OSW_WEo,588880,591040,and vocals and instruments really shine
WbA9OSW_WEo,591040,593279,in the mid-range one competitor i can
WbA9OSW_WEo,593279,595360,compare it to is omnitronic whose latest
WbA9OSW_WEo,595360,597200,model i just reviewed recently and the
WbA9OSW_WEo,597200,599519,ecla is definitely a step above in the
WbA9OSW_WEo,599519,601600,sound stakes and sure you'd kind of hope
WbA9OSW_WEo,601600,603360,it would be as the warm 2 is almost
WbA9OSW_WEo,603360,605200,twice the price of the equivalent 2
WbA9OSW_WEo,605200,607440,channel trm but it certainly would be
WbA9OSW_WEo,607440,610000,noteworthy if it wasn't superior truth
WbA9OSW_WEo,610000,611760,be told it has quite a similar sound
WbA9OSW_WEo,611760,614399,profile to my older new mixer but as i
WbA9OSW_WEo,614399,616800,already explained eclo were always known
WbA9OSW_WEo,616800,618800,for their excellent sound so that's not
WbA9OSW_WEo,618800,620640,a surprise either and i guess a lot of
WbA9OSW_WEo,620640,622560,that is down to the analog nature of the
WbA9OSW_WEo,622560,624560,warm 2. the company are able to tune the
WbA9OSW_WEo,624560,626560,sound to their own requirements rather
WbA9OSW_WEo,626560,628240,than just putting everything through an
WbA9OSW_WEo,628240,630079,off-the-shelf dac chip as on most
WbA9OSW_WEo,630079,632560,digital mixers a big part of the winning
WbA9OSW_WEo,632560,634800,sound on the warm 2 is down to the phono
WbA9OSW_WEo,634800,637040,preamps which are simply excellent i
WbA9OSW_WEo,637040,638160,tried them with a few different
WbA9OSW_WEo,638160,639760,cartridges and the clarity of the
WbA9OSW_WEo,639760,641600,preamps really allowed the differences
WbA9OSW_WEo,641600,643519,between those carts to be heard it's
WbA9OSW_WEo,643519,645279,also worth noting that the preamps are
WbA9OSW_WEo,645279,647279,very hot when it comes to output level
WbA9OSW_WEo,647279,649279,so if you lean towards more hifi
WbA9OSW_WEo,649279,651360,orientated carts with lower output
WbA9OSW_WEo,651360,653440,voltages the warm 2 should handle those
WbA9OSW_WEo,653440,655600,for you without fuss you don't have to
WbA9OSW_WEo,655600,657440,play vinyl through the warm 2 to enjoy
WbA9OSW_WEo,657440,659279,it but i'm certain that if you do it
WbA9OSW_WEo,659279,661440,will make you very happy overall i'm
WbA9OSW_WEo,661440,663360,just hugely impressed with the warm too
WbA9OSW_WEo,663360,665440,whether playing with digital or analog
WbA9OSW_WEo,665440,667600,sources ecla haven't tried to reinvent
WbA9OSW_WEo,667600,669680,the wheel here they've taken design cues
WbA9OSW_WEo,669680,671360,sound quality and features which they
WbA9OSW_WEo,671360,673120,were known for in the past and added
WbA9OSW_WEo,673120,675279,them into a contemporary package which
WbA9OSW_WEo,675279,677200,really feels and sounds a lot more
WbA9OSW_WEo,677200,678880,premium than you might expect
WbA9OSW_WEo,678880,681120,considering the price tag is it safe to
WbA9OSW_WEo,681120,683200,say ekla are back in the game with the
WbA9OSW_WEo,683200,685920,warm 2 i absolutely believe they are so
WbA9OSW_WEo,685920,687519,there you go my thoughts on the warm two
WbA9OSW_WEo,687519,689600,from ekler i'll be honest with you i was
WbA9OSW_WEo,689600,691519,concerned when echola said they were
WbA9OSW_WEo,691519,694000,coming back with this warm two
WbA9OSW_WEo,694000,696000,i was worried because they've been out
WbA9OSW_WEo,696000,698880,of the dj mixer game for many years now
WbA9OSW_WEo,698880,700720,they haven't made a new dj mixer for a
WbA9OSW_WEo,700720,704160,long time and i know that they weren't
WbA9OSW_WEo,704160,706320,ever the biggest brand the biggest
WbA9OSW_WEo,706320,708240,selling brand in the world in in any
WbA9OSW_WEo,708240,710399,part of the world at any time but they
WbA9OSW_WEo,710399,713040,did have a pretty loyal following of
WbA9OSW_WEo,713040,716160,people who really liked and respected
WbA9OSW_WEo,716160,718160,their ethos and the way they made their
WbA9OSW_WEo,718160,720160,products and i include myself in that
WbA9OSW_WEo,720160,723600,you know i swore by my ekla mixer for a
WbA9OSW_WEo,723600,726320,number of years i used it so much wore
WbA9OSW_WEo,726320,728639,the thing out and it still works today
WbA9OSW_WEo,728639,730800,so i was worried that they would somehow
WbA9OSW_WEo,730800,732160,kind of come in
WbA9OSW_WEo,732160,733040,and
WbA9OSW_WEo,733040,735200,not execute properly and kind of mess up
WbA9OSW_WEo,735200,737519,that legacy and i can say
WbA9OSW_WEo,737519,740000,categorically they have not messed up
WbA9OSW_WEo,740000,742320,that legacy they have continued through
WbA9OSW_WEo,742320,745040,it feels like in many ways an ekla
WbA9OSW_WEo,745040,748079,product of old but it still feels fresh
WbA9OSW_WEo,748079,750399,it still feels relevant today i think
WbA9OSW_WEo,750399,752399,this is a fantastic mixer for the money
WbA9OSW_WEo,752399,754320,i really do if you'd have given me this
WbA9OSW_WEo,754320,756480,mixer and let me play with it for a
WbA9OSW_WEo,756480,758800,while and asked me to price it what i
WbA9OSW_WEo,758800,760880,thought it would be sold at
WbA9OSW_WEo,760880,762639,i would have come in at a price much
WbA9OSW_WEo,762639,765120,closer to a thousand dollars a thousand
WbA9OSW_WEo,765120,767040,euros than what this thing is actually
WbA9OSW_WEo,767040,768240,selling for
WbA9OSW_WEo,768240,770160,i think the value proposition is very
WbA9OSW_WEo,770160,772079,very good now of course with any kind of
WbA9OSW_WEo,772079,774720,analog rotary mixer like this the main
WbA9OSW_WEo,774720,776639,audience for it is going to be people
WbA9OSW_WEo,776639,780160,who appreciate and value sound quality
WbA9OSW_WEo,780160,782000,and that is what you get with the warm
WbA9OSW_WEo,782000,784480,2. the overall sound of the mixer
WbA9OSW_WEo,784480,786639,wonderful the phono preamps
WbA9OSW_WEo,786639,787839,top-notch
WbA9OSW_WEo,787839,790240,really really nice photo preamps and
WbA9OSW_WEo,790240,792240,there's so much headroom there whatever
WbA9OSW_WEo,792240,794160,kind of cartridge you choose to use with
WbA9OSW_WEo,794160,795760,it you're going to get great results
WbA9OSW_WEo,795760,797040,you're not going to be pushing things in
WbA9OSW_WEo,797040,799360,terms of levels so overall yeah it's
WbA9OSW_WEo,799360,801200,really well designed really well made
WbA9OSW_WEo,801200,803680,and really well executed and it's a
WbA9OSW_WEo,803680,806320,fantastic return from the brand i just
