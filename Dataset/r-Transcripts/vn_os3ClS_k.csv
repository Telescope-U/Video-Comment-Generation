vn_os3ClS_k,160,1920,history shows that the relationship
vn_os3ClS_k,1920,4319,between russia and the u.s has a huge
vn_os3ClS_k,4319,6720,impact to consumer prices just look back
vn_os3ClS_k,6720,10000,to march 2014 after russia annexed
vn_os3ClS_k,10000,12240,crimea the u.s imposed sanctions but
vn_os3ClS_k,12240,14559,what happened was ford's stock price
vn_os3ClS_k,14559,16480,went down and this year russia started a
vn_os3ClS_k,16480,18080,war with ukraine and it's already
vn_os3ClS_k,18080,20640,impacting the u.s auto industry russia
vn_os3ClS_k,20640,22800,is a major producer of critical metals
vn_os3ClS_k,22800,24640,for car production like nickel and
vn_os3ClS_k,24640,27199,palladium russia supplies nearly 50
vn_os3ClS_k,27199,29279,percent of the palladium used to make
vn_os3ClS_k,29279,31119,catalytic converters and most of the
vn_os3ClS_k,31119,33200,lithium-ion batteries in our cars come
vn_os3ClS_k,33200,35680,from russia too if putin does decide to
vn_os3ClS_k,35680,37440,withhold russia's metal supplies
vn_os3ClS_k,37440,39600,completely u.s car makers may not be
vn_os3ClS_k,39600,41200,able to produce internal combustion
vn_os3ClS_k,41200,43360,engine cars at all the current russian
vn_os3ClS_k,43360,45520,ukrainian crisis is also making prices
vn_os3ClS_k,45520,48000,of these metals skyrocketing globally
vn_os3ClS_k,48000,49600,the cost of palladium per ounce has
vn_os3ClS_k,49600,51680,increased by 50 percent in just a few
vn_os3ClS_k,51680,53760,months imagine what's coming next but
vn_os3ClS_k,53760,55120,there's something worse than the car
vn_os3ClS_k,55120,56719,shortage that's coming up the conflict
vn_os3ClS_k,56719,58399,in eastern europe is putting a strain on
vn_os3ClS_k,58399,60800,the global food supply a couple of
vn_os3ClS_k,60800,62480,months ago president biden warned
vn_os3ClS_k,62480,64239,americans about an impending food
vn_os3ClS_k,64239,65920,shortage to come in the next several
vn_os3ClS_k,65920,68159,months these food shortages won't only
vn_os3ClS_k,68159,70400,impact grocery stores but they'll have a
vn_os3ClS_k,70400,72799,major impact on the auto industry too
vn_os3ClS_k,72799,75040,here's why
vn_os3ClS_k,75040,77759,to understand how these global food
vn_os3ClS_k,77759,79920,shortages even came about we have to
vn_os3ClS_k,79920,82320,travel back in time about two years ago
vn_os3ClS_k,82320,84240,all the way back to march 2020 that's
vn_os3ClS_k,84240,85920,when the pandemic started spreading
vn_os3ClS_k,85920,88000,around the globe entire countries were
vn_os3ClS_k,88000,90320,going under lockdowns those lockdowns
vn_os3ClS_k,90320,92000,forced schools and restaurants to shut
vn_os3ClS_k,92000,94000,their doors for months this completely
vn_os3ClS_k,94000,96000,blindsided the farming industry because
vn_os3ClS_k,96000,97840,the demand for their food products dried
vn_os3ClS_k,97840,99759,up and so they had destroyed all the
vn_os3ClS_k,99759,102560,extra supply they had for example that
vn_os3ClS_k,102560,105600,included dumping tons of gallons of milk
vn_os3ClS_k,105600,107759,plowing through entire crops and even
vn_os3ClS_k,107759,109759,euthanizing their own livestock but it
vn_os3ClS_k,109759,111280,wasn't only the farming industry that
vn_os3ClS_k,111280,112799,was suffering with restaurants and
vn_os3ClS_k,112799,114320,businesses closing their doors for
vn_os3ClS_k,114320,116560,uncertain time people lost their jobs
vn_os3ClS_k,116560,118240,unemployment skyrocketed and in the
vn_os3ClS_k,118240,119920,meantime government printed money to
vn_os3ClS_k,119920,122079,send out stimulus checks the problem was
vn_os3ClS_k,122079,124479,that this led to shortages at food banks
vn_os3ClS_k,124479,126719,really the lockdowns in 2020 were just
vn_os3ClS_k,126719,128479,the first drop in the food shortage that
vn_os3ClS_k,128479,130239,will only get worse in a month leading
vn_os3ClS_k,130239,132800,to 2021 grocery stores worldwide were
vn_os3ClS_k,132800,134560,already finding their shelves empty but
vn_os3ClS_k,134560,136640,it's not over yet analysts expect these
vn_os3ClS_k,136640,138640,food shortages to only increase in
vn_os3ClS_k,138640,140560,magnitude but now it's not directly
vn_os3ClS_k,140560,142400,because of the pandemic now due to the
vn_os3ClS_k,142400,144080,conflict in eastern europe and the
vn_os3ClS_k,144080,145599,effects of these food shortages are
vn_os3ClS_k,145599,147599,going to reach a lot closer to home than
vn_os3ClS_k,147599,150640,you might think this past march biden
vn_os3ClS_k,150640,152640,spoke to reporters at nato headquarters
vn_os3ClS_k,152640,154080,and warned americans that a food
vn_os3ClS_k,154080,156080,shortage was impending because of the
vn_os3ClS_k,156080,157920,sanctions against russia russia is
vn_os3ClS_k,157920,159920,retaliating big time they've reduced
vn_os3ClS_k,159920,161920,exports of their natural gas crude oil
vn_os3ClS_k,161920,164080,grain and rare earth metals they've also
vn_os3ClS_k,164080,166400,reduced export of fuel for nuclear power
vn_os3ClS_k,166400,168160,plants in the u.s and they're blocking
vn_os3ClS_k,168160,169920,shipping of wheat from ukraine to the
vn_os3ClS_k,169920,172319,entire world here's what we do agree on
vn_os3ClS_k,172319,174400,now they are anticipating that higher
vn_os3ClS_k,174400,176560,energy fertilizer corn and wheat prices
vn_os3ClS_k,176560,178080,could impact the price of growing and
vn_os3ClS_k,178080,180080,purchasing critical fuel and food
vn_os3ClS_k,180080,182159,supplies here in america and around the
vn_os3ClS_k,182159,183760,world here's the thing ukraine and
vn_os3ClS_k,183760,186239,russia are both major exporters of
vn_os3ClS_k,186239,188319,fertilizer but it's not just the us
vn_os3ClS_k,188319,189599,government who's talking about an
vn_os3ClS_k,189599,191280,impending food crisis farmers and
vn_os3ClS_k,191280,192879,truckers across the country have been
vn_os3ClS_k,192879,195599,sounding the alarm 66 this year weed up
vn_os3ClS_k,195599,198239,22.7 for example one man tweeted that
vn_os3ClS_k,198239,199599,farmers in the south can't get
vn_os3ClS_k,199599,201200,fertilizer for their crops and that
vn_os3ClS_k,201200,202720,farmers in the midwest can't get
vn_os3ClS_k,202720,205040,nitrogen or fertilizers he said buckle
vn_os3ClS_k,205040,207440,up folks because the media isn't even
vn_os3ClS_k,207440,209280,warning you talking about sounding an
vn_os3ClS_k,209280,211200,alarm another farmer spoke out saying
vn_os3ClS_k,211200,212560,that he and other farmers across the
vn_os3ClS_k,212560,214400,country believe that dramatically
vn_os3ClS_k,214400,216080,increased costs of fertilizer will make
vn_os3ClS_k,216080,218400,it impossible for farmers to profitably
vn_os3ClS_k,218400,220480,plant corn this year operating costs for
vn_os3ClS_k,220480,222319,things like fertilizer seeds and liquid
vn_os3ClS_k,222319,224319,nitrogen are almost triple and quadruple
vn_os3ClS_k,224319,227040,the old prices it will not be profitable
vn_os3ClS_k,227040,228879,to plant this year some farmers are
vn_os3ClS_k,228879,230879,deciding to switch from corn to soybeans
vn_os3ClS_k,230879,232799,for 2022 but there is currently a
vn_os3ClS_k,232799,234720,shortage of soybean seeds so plants are
vn_os3ClS_k,234720,236400,still up in the air some farmers even
vn_os3ClS_k,236400,238720,gone so far as a green that will be a
vn_os3ClS_k,238720,240799,major grain shortage later this year
vn_os3ClS_k,240799,242879,especially with corn and that's a major
vn_os3ClS_k,242879,244319,issue seeing that corn is one of the
vn_os3ClS_k,244319,246080,fundamental pillars of the u.s food
vn_os3ClS_k,246080,248159,industry just remember one key thing
vn_os3ClS_k,248159,250319,shortages of corn and wheat isn't like
vn_os3ClS_k,250319,252319,some shortage of semiconductor chips or
vn_os3ClS_k,252319,254720,even cars if you miss the farming season
vn_os3ClS_k,254720,256720,this impacts food supplies for the next
vn_os3ClS_k,256720,258479,few years and while we can deal without
vn_os3ClS_k,258479,260720,a new smartphone or new car we can't
vn_os3ClS_k,260720,262479,live without food the longer the war
vn_os3ClS_k,262479,264320,continues the higher the risk of ripple
vn_os3ClS_k,264320,266639,effects of these food supply it's even
vn_os3ClS_k,266639,268960,expected to extend to the auto industry
vn_os3ClS_k,268960,270880,as a whole according to many experts the
vn_os3ClS_k,270880,272639,war could reduce global production of
vn_os3ClS_k,272639,274479,new cars and trucks by the millions in
vn_os3ClS_k,274479,277680,2022 that's this year the european auto
vn_os3ClS_k,277680,279440,market will feel the effects too and
vn_os3ClS_k,279440,281520,they'll feel it first then the u.s and
vn_os3ClS_k,281520,283280,other markets will be next european
vn_os3ClS_k,283280,285280,automakers mercedes-benz and audi have
vn_os3ClS_k,285280,286479,already announced that they'll be
vn_os3ClS_k,286479,288160,cutting production at their plants this
vn_os3ClS_k,288160,289680,is due to wire harness that are no
vn_os3ClS_k,289680,291440,longer coming in from their plants in
vn_os3ClS_k,291440,293759,ukraine russia and ukraine are extremely
vn_os3ClS_k,293759,295759,important sources of palladium and neon
vn_os3ClS_k,295759,297680,gas which is critical to producing
vn_os3ClS_k,297680,299680,semiconductor chips ukraine itself
vn_os3ClS_k,299680,301919,produces almost 70 percent of the
vn_os3ClS_k,301919,303919,world's neon gas needed for important
vn_os3ClS_k,303919,305840,components especially in the auto
vn_os3ClS_k,305840,307199,industry but because of the current
vn_os3ClS_k,307199,308639,crisis in both these countries
vn_os3ClS_k,308639,311039,researchers expect there will be 3.5
vn_os3ClS_k,311039,313120,million fewer vehicles globally but now
vn_os3ClS_k,313120,315199,let's talk about short term how bad are
vn_os3ClS_k,315199,316880,we talking here for consumers here in
vn_os3ClS_k,316880,318800,the u.s the most immediate impact of
vn_os3ClS_k,318800,320479,this war is higher gas prices they're
vn_os3ClS_k,320479,322479,already sky high and they're only
vn_os3ClS_k,322479,324560,expected to continue skyrocket because
vn_os3ClS_k,324560,326880,of these sky-high prices europeans have
vn_os3ClS_k,326880,328560,already decreased their driving habits
vn_os3ClS_k,328560,330400,like those in turkey and germany did you
vn_os3ClS_k,330400,332080,know that if you think four dollars to
vn_os3ClS_k,332080,333440,five dollars a gallon the u.s is
vn_os3ClS_k,333440,335520,expensive well listen to expensive gases
vn_os3ClS_k,335520,337280,in germany eight dollars and twenty six
vn_os3ClS_k,337280,338880,cents a gallon no wonder drivers in
vn_os3ClS_k,338880,340400,europe are getting smarter about how
vn_os3ClS_k,340400,342880,much they really need to drive experts
vn_os3ClS_k,342880,344400,predict that a price tag of four dollar
vn_os3ClS_k,344400,346400,gallon in the us by the first of april
vn_os3ClS_k,346400,348800,and indeed last month gas prices passed
vn_os3ClS_k,348800,350639,that mark in every u.s state for the
vn_os3ClS_k,350639,352160,first time in history and since their
vn_os3ClS_k,352160,354000,original predictions have come true what
vn_os3ClS_k,354000,355919,are they expecting now well the head of
vn_os3ClS_k,355919,358000,petroleum analysis at gas buddy said
vn_os3ClS_k,358000,359759,today liquid fuels have turned into
vn_os3ClS_k,359759,361520,liquid gold prices for gasoline and
vn_os3ClS_k,361520,363520,diesel are spiraling out of control
vn_os3ClS_k,363520,365600,because of the global supply and demand
vn_os3ClS_k,365600,367759,imbalance canada also hit an all-time
vn_os3ClS_k,367759,370080,gas price high the same week there gas
vn_os3ClS_k,370080,372000,hit eight dollars and fifteen cents
vn_os3ClS_k,372000,373680,canadian dollars a gallon for the first
vn_os3ClS_k,373680,375280,time in history and that's despite the
vn_os3ClS_k,375280,377199,fact that canada has the world's third
vn_os3ClS_k,377199,379600,largest oil reserves after venezuela and
vn_os3ClS_k,379600,381680,saudi arabia so what are gas price
vn_os3ClS_k,381680,383360,predictions for the future gas buddy
vn_os3ClS_k,383360,385199,predicts the average cost per gallon in
vn_os3ClS_k,385199,387520,this country will hit 425 in june for
vn_os3ClS_k,387520,389360,now american and canadians can still
vn_os3ClS_k,389360,391360,drive without overly worrying about gas
vn_os3ClS_k,391360,393680,prices but eventually we too will reach
vn_os3ClS_k,393680,395600,a tipping point did you know that last
vn_os3ClS_k,395600,397440,month renault agreed to sell their stake
vn_os3ClS_k,397440,399280,to russia here's why this is important
vn_os3ClS_k,399280,401120,to know renault originally began their
vn_os3ClS_k,401120,402880,joint venture with the city of moscow
vn_os3ClS_k,402880,405680,back in 2005. yet last march they
vn_os3ClS_k,405680,407759,suspended operations at their moscow
vn_os3ClS_k,407759,409599,plant this announcement was made only
vn_os3ClS_k,409599,412240,hours after ukrainian president jalenski
vn_os3ClS_k,412240,414400,addressed the french senate and asked
vn_os3ClS_k,414400,416000,for renault and other french companies
vn_os3ClS_k,416000,418080,to leave russia then renault announced
vn_os3ClS_k,418080,420479,their plans to sell their 68 share in
vn_os3ClS_k,420479,423199,avatovas russia's biggest car maker 2
vn_os3ClS_k,423199,425599,nami a moscow-based automotive research
vn_os3ClS_k,425599,427759,institute renault did not disclose the
vn_os3ClS_k,427759,429360,exact price they planned to sell the
vn_os3ClS_k,429360,431360,stake for but i'm sure it's nominal
vn_os3ClS_k,431360,432960,because if they don't sell it russia
vn_os3ClS_k,432960,434720,will just seize it for free anyway we're
vn_os3ClS_k,434720,436160,now called the sale to the city of
vn_os3ClS_k,436160,438319,moscow a responsible choice chief
vn_os3ClS_k,438319,440639,executive luco demaio said that it was a
vn_os3ClS_k,440639,442960,difficult but necessary decision russian
vn_os3ClS_k,442960,444319,officials recently threatened to
vn_os3ClS_k,444319,446319,nationalize western businesses backing
vn_os3ClS_k,446319,448160,out of russia due to the current war so
vn_os3ClS_k,448160,449919,by nationalizing the renault factory
vn_os3ClS_k,449919,451599,that would make it the first major
vn_os3ClS_k,451599,453520,transfer of private assets into russia's
vn_os3ClS_k,453520,455599,hands recently they nationalized
vn_os3ClS_k,455599,457280,mcdonald's this is just the beginning
vn_os3ClS_k,457280,459120,think of it from an economic standpoint
vn_os3ClS_k,459120,461199,if for now with 45 000 employees in
vn_os3ClS_k,461199,463120,russia is now nationalized and they just
vn_os3ClS_k,463120,464800,lost an entire factory in business in
vn_os3ClS_k,464800,466319,the country won't they increase their
vn_os3ClS_k,466319,468240,car prices to recuperate some of this
vn_os3ClS_k,468240,470160,loss won't this also create a shortage
vn_os3ClS_k,470160,471840,of renault cars so now you see how the
vn_os3ClS_k,471840,474240,war is impacting the car supply and
vn_os3ClS_k,474240,476160,prices to understand this a bit more
vn_os3ClS_k,476160,477599,just look what happened in iran when the
vn_os3ClS_k,477599,479280,u.s sanctioned it some of you can
vn_os3ClS_k,479280,481039,describe these international sanctions
vn_os3ClS_k,481039,483199,as crippling iran's car industry you see
vn_os3ClS_k,483199,484479,at the time of these sanctions
vn_os3ClS_k,484479,486479,automobile manufacturing was iran's
vn_os3ClS_k,486479,488400,second largest industry it accounted for
vn_os3ClS_k,488400,490800,10 percent of iran's gdp and 4 percent
vn_os3ClS_k,490800,492720,of its workforce the only thing larger
vn_os3ClS_k,492720,494720,than the auto industry in iran was the
vn_os3ClS_k,494720,497360,hydrocarbon industry some in iran were
vn_os3ClS_k,497360,499199,expecting the sanctions for quite some
vn_os3ClS_k,499199,501360,time so they got prepared for it iranian
vn_os3ClS_k,501360,503199,firms were able to work with companies
vn_os3ClS_k,503199,504960,in eastern europe and the persian gulf
vn_os3ClS_k,504960,506879,to overcome some of the challenges of
vn_os3ClS_k,506879,508879,these sanctions after these sanctions
vn_os3ClS_k,508879,512000,hit from 2011 to 2013 iran's productions
vn_os3ClS_k,512000,513760,of cars dropped to more than half from
vn_os3ClS_k,513760,515440,one million four hundred twenty thousand
vn_os3ClS_k,515440,516959,a year to six hundred twenty four
vn_os3ClS_k,516959,518880,thousand seven hundred and fifty a year
vn_os3ClS_k,518880,520640,and at the same time imported cars
vn_os3ClS_k,520640,524000,totaled 3.7 billion in 2013. that made
vn_os3ClS_k,524000,526959,up almost 12.6 percent of domestic
vn_os3ClS_k,526959,528800,production but then came the late part
vn_os3ClS_k,528800,531839,of 2013. nuclear negotiations moved into
vn_os3ClS_k,531839,534320,a new phase and sanctions were partially
vn_os3ClS_k,534320,537040,eased and so in 2014 this downward trend
vn_os3ClS_k,537040,538720,was reversed production increased by a
vn_os3ClS_k,538720,543200,huge 53 percent that's 736 9448 total
vn_os3ClS_k,543200,547839,vehicles in 2013 up to 1 million 130 164
vn_os3ClS_k,547839,550399,in 2014 and the iranian autism industry
vn_os3ClS_k,550399,553120,as a whole grew 41 in april of the same
vn_os3ClS_k,553120,554959,year compared to the one prior these
vn_os3ClS_k,554959,556880,sanctions also led to the sharp
vn_os3ClS_k,556880,558800,devaluation of the iranian currency a
vn_os3ClS_k,558800,561360,devaluation of more than 200 since the
vn_os3ClS_k,561360,563120,sanctions were reinforced because of
vn_os3ClS_k,563120,564640,this the price of imported cars
vn_os3ClS_k,564640,566480,skyrocketed and so many iranian
vn_os3ClS_k,566480,568320,consumers turned to domestic cars to
vn_os3ClS_k,568320,570640,produce the car in iran cost about 2 500
vn_os3ClS_k,570640,572560,bucks the average imported car cost
vn_os3ClS_k,572560,574800,around 8 000. so you can understand the
vn_os3ClS_k,574800,576800,pull towards domestic cars and away from
vn_os3ClS_k,576800,579760,imports in 2014 iran produced 1.1
vn_os3ClS_k,579760,581760,million vehicles and you'll never guess
vn_os3ClS_k,581760,584080,how much of that ended up saving almost
vn_os3ClS_k,584080,585519,6 billion
vn_os3ClS_k,585519,587040,interestingly enough during that same
vn_os3ClS_k,587040,589120,period iran decided to expand trade
vn_os3ClS_k,589120,591120,relations with eastern europe and china
vn_os3ClS_k,591120,593360,cherry a major chinese auto manufacturer
vn_os3ClS_k,593360,596240,had begun exporting cars to iran in 2005
vn_os3ClS_k,596240,598160,but after these international sanctions
vn_os3ClS_k,598160,599839,more than 20 chinese automakers and
vn_os3ClS_k,599839,602079,manufacturers entered iran's market that
vn_os3ClS_k,602079,604160,included companies like shanghuan lip
vn_os3ClS_k,604160,607200,ban haima dong fang futon brilliance and
vn_os3ClS_k,607200,609839,mg have you even heard of these karmic
vn_os3ClS_k,609839,611440,obviously most americans have it those
vn_os3ClS_k,611440,613360,are cheap cars but they take you where
vn_os3ClS_k,613360,615360,you need to go anyway after all that in
vn_os3ClS_k,615360,618079,2018 the u.s reinstated sanctions on
vn_os3ClS_k,618079,620160,iran total value of imported contents
vn_os3ClS_k,620160,622800,for car manufacturing was cut by 2.5
vn_os3ClS_k,622800,624880,billion so did that end up destroying
vn_os3ClS_k,624880,627120,iran's auto industry completely far from
vn_os3ClS_k,627120,629200,it believe it or not iran's auto sector
vn_os3ClS_k,629200,631040,has started standing on its own feet
vn_os3ClS_k,631040,632560,even though they had previously been
vn_os3ClS_k,632560,634800,relying on imported car kits for years
vn_os3ClS_k,634800,636240,once these foreign companies stopped
vn_os3ClS_k,636240,638480,supplying to iran iran shocked the auto
vn_os3ClS_k,638480,640240,industry as we know it in fact iranian
vn_os3ClS_k,640240,641920,officials have now started referring to
vn_os3ClS_k,641920,643680,these sanctions as a blessing that's
vn_os3ClS_k,643680,645360,because these sanctions motivated iran
vn_os3ClS_k,645360,647680,to build and rely on their own cars
vn_os3ClS_k,647680,649920,right now each iranian-made car requires
vn_os3ClS_k,649920,652079,fifteen hundred to seventeen hundred us
vn_os3ClS_k,652079,653920,dollars to make you recall it was twenty
vn_os3ClS_k,653920,655760,five hundred twenty thirteen but iran
vn_os3ClS_k,655760,657440,expects that figure to decrease
vn_os3ClS_k,657440,659279,exponentially thanks to government
vn_os3ClS_k,659279,661200,support in fact an iranian deputy
vn_os3ClS_k,661200,663120,industry minister recently stated that
vn_os3ClS_k,663120,664800,iranian automakers would produce more
vn_os3ClS_k,664800,667920,than 1.3 million cars in 2021 that's a
vn_os3ClS_k,667920,670079,whole 50 percent jump in production
vn_os3ClS_k,670079,672240,despite all the u.s sanctions and i
vn_os3ClS_k,672240,673519,predict a similar thing will happen to
vn_os3ClS_k,673519,675200,the russian car industry no they won't
vn_os3ClS_k,675200,677200,drive bmw or cadillac's because of
vn_os3ClS_k,677200,678880,sanctions but now they'll start making
vn_os3ClS_k,678880,681760,lottas for 1500 bucks or whatever and
vn_os3ClS_k,681760,683279,they'll still drive wherever they need
vn_os3ClS_k,683279,685519,to go so really then who's losing out as
vn_os3ClS_k,685519,687600,a result of sanctions all foreign car
vn_os3ClS_k,687600,689680,makers who stop exporting to russia at
vn_os3ClS_k,689680,691120,the end of the day are losing out in
vn_os3ClS_k,691120,692959,that market as global food shortages
vn_os3ClS_k,692959,694640,gets worse and believe me it will then
vn_os3ClS_k,694640,696880,consumers will de-prioritize new car
vn_os3ClS_k,696880,699279,purchases completely but for now please
vn_os3ClS_k,699279,701200,share this video with family and friends
vn_os3ClS_k,701200,703279,and save this video on your watch later
vn_os3ClS_k,703279,705200,list and check it out again next year
vn_os3ClS_k,705200,710040,when i can say i told you so
