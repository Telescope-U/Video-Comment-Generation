QMWlRWnAZH8,799,3199,right are you ready for some drama
QMWlRWnAZH8,3199,5680,welcome to my top 21 most painful tech
QMWlRWnAZH8,5680,6240,fails
QMWlRWnAZH8,6240,8320,of the entire decade from just
QMWlRWnAZH8,8320,9280,inadequate
QMWlRWnAZH8,9280,12080,to catastrophic spoiler alert this is
QMWlRWnAZH8,12080,13440,the first time we've ever had
QMWlRWnAZH8,13440,15120,a 10 out of 10 fail on one of these
QMWlRWnAZH8,15120,17119,lists okay so in 2018
QMWlRWnAZH8,17119,19760,lg revolutionized the way that humans
QMWlRWnAZH8,19760,21359,interacted with robots
QMWlRWnAZH8,21359,24080,just not in a good way i was actually
QMWlRWnAZH8,24080,25840,sitting here in this crowd when they
QMWlRWnAZH8,25840,26880,showed to the world
QMWlRWnAZH8,26880,30400,lg chloe one robot to manage your entire
QMWlRWnAZH8,30400,31119,home
QMWlRWnAZH8,31119,33520,and never in my life have i seen
QMWlRWnAZH8,33520,34480,excitement
QMWlRWnAZH8,34480,36719,turn into so much cringe i want to
QMWlRWnAZH8,36719,38480,disappear into my chair
QMWlRWnAZH8,38480,40719,this quickly am i ready on my washer and
QMWlRWnAZH8,40719,42399,cycle he asked a question to it and
QMWlRWnAZH8,42399,44000,for five of the longest seconds of my
QMWlRWnAZH8,44000,46079,entire life the whole audience just sat
QMWlRWnAZH8,46079,46399,there
QMWlRWnAZH8,46399,48399,eyes wide waiting to see what this next
QMWlRWnAZH8,48399,50879,generation of robots was about to do
QMWlRWnAZH8,50879,53120,we're still waiting but it only started
QMWlRWnAZH8,53120,54559,to get really awkward
QMWlRWnAZH8,54559,56399,when he then tried again for a second
QMWlRWnAZH8,56399,60559,time chloe what's for dinner tonight
QMWlRWnAZH8,61520,63359,fair play to the guy on stage he tried
QMWlRWnAZH8,63359,64720,to play it off like the robot was just
QMWlRWnAZH8,64720,65680,angry at him
QMWlRWnAZH8,65680,67360,but by the time he got blanked for the
QMWlRWnAZH8,67360,69439,third time chloe are you talking to me
QMWlRWnAZH8,69439,69840,yet
QMWlRWnAZH8,69840,73840,what recipes could i make with chicken
QMWlRWnAZH8,73840,76159,the entire audience was just laughing so
QMWlRWnAZH8,76159,78479,i'm giving lg chloe a 2 out of 10
QMWlRWnAZH8,78479,81280,on the failed scale now when i say the
QMWlRWnAZH8,81280,82479,word smartphone to you
QMWlRWnAZH8,82479,84320,what do you think of some sort of
QMWlRWnAZH8,84320,85600,rectangular glass
QMWlRWnAZH8,85600,88560,sandwich right well the runcible is what
QMWlRWnAZH8,88560,89119,you get
QMWlRWnAZH8,89119,91119,when you defy that convention or really
QMWlRWnAZH8,91119,92320,to be more specific
QMWlRWnAZH8,92320,94079,it's what you get when you defy every
QMWlRWnAZH8,94079,96159,convention it was world's first circular
QMWlRWnAZH8,96159,96880,smartphone
QMWlRWnAZH8,96880,99040,it ditched glass construction for wood
QMWlRWnAZH8,99040,100880,it was even fully user upgradable for
QMWlRWnAZH8,100880,102079,sustainability
QMWlRWnAZH8,102079,104560,it's just it couldn't make phone calls
QMWlRWnAZH8,104560,105759,if you look at the small print on the
QMWlRWnAZH8,105759,106479,website
QMWlRWnAZH8,106479,109360,they refer to it as a very small tablet
QMWlRWnAZH8,109360,110560,which is fine but
QMWlRWnAZH8,110560,112560,what kind of tablet content am i going
QMWlRWnAZH8,112560,114960,to consume on a 2.5 inch
QMWlRWnAZH8,114960,118560,circular display 2 out of 10.
QMWlRWnAZH8,118560,121200,anyways did you know that in 2016
QMWlRWnAZH8,121200,123119,microsoft created a twitter account
QMWlRWnAZH8,123119,125119,that used artificial intelligence to
QMWlRWnAZH8,125119,126880,learn how to talk like a human
QMWlRWnAZH8,126880,128959,they called her tay and they said to
QMWlRWnAZH8,128959,130640,people the more you talk to her
QMWlRWnAZH8,130640,134800,the smarter she becomes well in 24 hours
QMWlRWnAZH8,134800,136640,tay was tweeting some of the most
QMWlRWnAZH8,136640,138959,horrific racial slurs on the platform
QMWlRWnAZH8,138959,140640,when she was created she started off by
QMWlRWnAZH8,140640,142319,saying humans were super cool
QMWlRWnAZH8,142319,144959,and how she was stoked to meet us but in
QMWlRWnAZH8,144959,146319,less than one day
QMWlRWnAZH8,146319,148800,she was trying to start a race war i'm
QMWlRWnAZH8,148800,150160,not even exaggerating
QMWlRWnAZH8,150160,152640,she was swearing she was quoting hitler
QMWlRWnAZH8,152640,154000,because she was learning from every
QMWlRWnAZH8,154000,155440,single conversation
QMWlRWnAZH8,155440,157680,the wider population started abusing
QMWlRWnAZH8,157680,159280,that teaching her to say things which
QMWlRWnAZH8,159280,159760,were just
QMWlRWnAZH8,159760,161760,completely out of order tay was
QMWlRWnAZH8,161760,163120,sophisticated enough to
QMWlRWnAZH8,163120,165280,to pick up how humans talked but she
QMWlRWnAZH8,165280,166640,wasn't sophisticated enough
QMWlRWnAZH8,166640,168560,to know when she was being led on and so
QMWlRWnAZH8,168560,170319,within 24 hours of being up
QMWlRWnAZH8,170319,173440,tay was cancelled which feels like a
QMWlRWnAZH8,173440,174879,pretty good general summary of twitter
QMWlRWnAZH8,174879,175360,right now
QMWlRWnAZH8,175360,176800,and a pretty alarming example of why
QMWlRWnAZH8,176800,178720,we've got to be so careful with how much
QMWlRWnAZH8,178720,179280,power
QMWlRWnAZH8,179280,182239,we give to ai so pretty easy 3 out of 10
QMWlRWnAZH8,182239,183280,fail for this one
QMWlRWnAZH8,183280,186319,and by the way this video was sponsored
QMWlRWnAZH8,186319,186959,by huell
QMWlRWnAZH8,186959,188319,got something pretty cool to show you at
QMWlRWnAZH8,188319,191440,the end for this okay in late 2019
QMWlRWnAZH8,191440,194000,a very excited elon musk walks on stage
QMWlRWnAZH8,194000,195120,to show the world
QMWlRWnAZH8,195120,197360,cybertruck can you imagine being in this
QMWlRWnAZH8,197360,199200,audience with no idea what's coming no
QMWlRWnAZH8,199200,200480,leaks no images
QMWlRWnAZH8,200480,202480,and then watching as this thing rolls
QMWlRWnAZH8,202480,203519,onto stage
QMWlRWnAZH8,203519,205599,people were going wild i've never seen
QMWlRWnAZH8,205599,206959,this many audience members trying to
QMWlRWnAZH8,206959,208959,take a photo at the exact same time
QMWlRWnAZH8,208959,211360,the only slight hitch though was that
QMWlRWnAZH8,211360,213120,they spent a good portion of this event
QMWlRWnAZH8,213120,214799,talking about how strong the cyber truck
QMWlRWnAZH8,214799,216879,was they said it had a virtually
QMWlRWnAZH8,216879,219280,impenetrable exoskeleton they said the
QMWlRWnAZH8,219280,221120,glass was practically bulletproof
QMWlRWnAZH8,221120,224319,except when they actually tested it oh
QMWlRWnAZH8,224319,224640,my
QMWlRWnAZH8,224640,227599,god they broke it and they then did what
QMWlRWnAZH8,227599,229280,seems to be a common theme here
QMWlRWnAZH8,229280,231280,they tried again they picked up the same
QMWlRWnAZH8,231280,232799,ball this time threw it at the rear
QMWlRWnAZH8,232799,233760,window
QMWlRWnAZH8,233760,236319,and they broke that too and of course
QMWlRWnAZH8,236319,238400,this clip became the most viewed video
QMWlRWnAZH8,238400,240080,about the cyber truck by a long
QMWlRWnAZH8,240080,242000,shot there are still plenty of people
QMWlRWnAZH8,242000,243519,who are excited about this car
QMWlRWnAZH8,243519,246879,but that was awkward okay let's do a
QMWlRWnAZH8,246879,248640,rapid fire round for google here
QMWlRWnAZH8,248640,251519,three fails three minutes let's go so
QMWlRWnAZH8,251519,253200,first of all was the nexus q
QMWlRWnAZH8,253200,255040,it was a media streamer basically a way
QMWlRWnAZH8,255040,256639,for your phone to display content on
QMWlRWnAZH8,256639,257600,your tv
QMWlRWnAZH8,257600,260880,think chromecast only worse
QMWlRWnAZH8,260880,263680,it was wildly expensive at 300 it could
QMWlRWnAZH8,263680,265600,only stream google content like google
QMWlRWnAZH8,265600,266400,play music
QMWlRWnAZH8,266400,268320,which is also dead and the new york
QMWlRWnAZH8,268320,270880,times described this as wildly overbuilt
QMWlRWnAZH8,270880,273759,for its limited functions which is not
QMWlRWnAZH8,273759,274720,the kind of review that
QMWlRWnAZH8,274720,276639,any brand wants but even more
QMWlRWnAZH8,276639,278800,disappointing was google glass
QMWlRWnAZH8,278800,280960,because unlike the nexus q which just
QMWlRWnAZH8,280960,282560,kind of came out of nowhere and then
QMWlRWnAZH8,282560,283360,flopped
QMWlRWnAZH8,283360,285360,people were excited about glass google
QMWlRWnAZH8,285360,286800,made trailers like this
QMWlRWnAZH8,286800,288160,showing us the world that we were about
QMWlRWnAZH8,288160,289919,to step into they showed four people
QMWlRWnAZH8,289919,290720,wearing glass
QMWlRWnAZH8,290720,292720,jumping out of a plane whilst all still
QMWlRWnAZH8,292720,294560,having a google hangouts chat
QMWlRWnAZH8,294560,297120,however there is such thing as being too
QMWlRWnAZH8,297120,297840,early
QMWlRWnAZH8,297840,299840,google was trying to merge the digital
QMWlRWnAZH8,299840,301360,and the physical worlds
QMWlRWnAZH8,301360,303199,before the tech was really able to and
QMWlRWnAZH8,303199,304960,so for almost everything it could do
QMWlRWnAZH8,304960,307199,it just had a massive asterisk next to
QMWlRWnAZH8,307199,309039,it you can probably imagine then that
QMWlRWnAZH8,309039,310560,this whole concept of dropping fifteen
QMWlRWnAZH8,310560,312560,hundred dollars to effectively beta test
QMWlRWnAZH8,312560,313280,a product
QMWlRWnAZH8,313280,314720,that did everything your phone did but
QMWlRWnAZH8,314720,316880,worse did not sit well with the average
QMWlRWnAZH8,316880,317680,consumer
QMWlRWnAZH8,317680,320000,and the final google blunder at least
QMWlRWnAZH8,320000,320880,for this video
QMWlRWnAZH8,320880,322720,is stadia i remember watching this thing
QMWlRWnAZH8,322720,324639,get announced this whole idea of you
QMWlRWnAZH8,324639,326080,being able to just watch some gameplay
QMWlRWnAZH8,326080,326800,on youtube
QMWlRWnAZH8,326800,328960,and if you like the look of it click one
QMWlRWnAZH8,328960,331280,button and jump into that game yourself
QMWlRWnAZH8,331280,332720,all being powered by your internet
QMWlRWnAZH8,332720,334479,browser with no downloads
QMWlRWnAZH8,334479,336720,and no console needed i remember nearly
QMWlRWnAZH8,336720,338240,spitting my drink out all over my
QMWlRWnAZH8,338240,339840,keyboard because
QMWlRWnAZH8,339840,342639,whoa it's just trying to stream a game
QMWlRWnAZH8,342639,344000,has a lot more complications than trying
QMWlRWnAZH8,344000,345759,to stream a movie or a song
QMWlRWnAZH8,345759,348400,most notably input lag think about it
QMWlRWnAZH8,348400,349840,for every single time i press a key on
QMWlRWnAZH8,349840,350800,my controller
QMWlRWnAZH8,350800,352240,that command has to be transmitted
QMWlRWnAZH8,352240,353919,wirelessly to my computer
QMWlRWnAZH8,353919,355280,it's then got to find its way all the
QMWlRWnAZH8,355280,356880,way towards the servers that are hosting
QMWlRWnAZH8,356880,357520,this game
QMWlRWnAZH8,357520,359440,which we're often not close at all
QMWlRWnAZH8,359440,360960,process that command to produce an
QMWlRWnAZH8,360960,363039,output and then send that next frame
QMWlRWnAZH8,363039,365199,all the way back down to my computer so
QMWlRWnAZH8,365199,366800,that i can see what's happening next
QMWlRWnAZH8,366800,368800,or to put it in a more visual way this
QMWlRWnAZH8,368800,370639,is kind of what the gameplay looked like
QMWlRWnAZH8,370639,372960,and this is on a high speed internet
QMWlRWnAZH8,372960,373759,connection
QMWlRWnAZH8,373759,375440,info lag was only one of stadia's many
QMWlRWnAZH8,375440,377280,problems but we do need to cover other
QMWlRWnAZH8,377280,378639,things in this video too
QMWlRWnAZH8,378639,382000,like the wii u oh
QMWlRWnAZH8,382000,385360,made it thank you you remember the wii
QMWlRWnAZH8,385360,386080,right
QMWlRWnAZH8,386080,388240,that console even though it was about as
QMWlRWnAZH8,388240,389440,powerful as my fridge
QMWlRWnAZH8,389440,391759,it changed gaming forever it was the
QMWlRWnAZH8,391759,393199,first time that i'd ever seen
QMWlRWnAZH8,393199,394800,three-year-old kids playing the same
QMWlRWnAZH8,394800,396880,games as their 70 year old grandparents
QMWlRWnAZH8,396880,398560,with both groups loving it
QMWlRWnAZH8,398560,400560,so it's kind of crazy that nintendo
QMWlRWnAZH8,400560,402880,could go straight from highs like this
QMWlRWnAZH8,402880,405199,to lows like this six years after the
QMWlRWnAZH8,405199,407199,wii they decided it was time
QMWlRWnAZH8,407199,409440,for its next-gen successor a console
QMWlRWnAZH8,409440,410560,that you could just play normally
QMWlRWnAZH8,410560,412720,on your tv but also with the option to
QMWlRWnAZH8,412720,414080,play the entire games
QMWlRWnAZH8,414080,416160,using just this new controller with its
QMWlRWnAZH8,416160,417199,built-in screen
QMWlRWnAZH8,417199,419039,so other people could use the tv at the
QMWlRWnAZH8,419039,420479,same time i don't think it was a
QMWlRWnAZH8,420479,421440,terrible idea
QMWlRWnAZH8,421440,424479,it's just it was executed with all the
QMWlRWnAZH8,424479,425360,elegance of a
QMWlRWnAZH8,425360,428400,galaxy note 7 moments before explosion
QMWlRWnAZH8,428400,430560,there were plenty of issues but i'd say
QMWlRWnAZH8,430560,432160,the primary culprit is just the fact
QMWlRWnAZH8,432160,432560,that
QMWlRWnAZH8,432560,434960,they called it the wii u what does that
QMWlRWnAZH8,434960,435599,even mean
QMWlRWnAZH8,435599,437759,and more importantly doesn't that just
QMWlRWnAZH8,437759,439360,make it sound like it's an add-on
QMWlRWnAZH8,439360,442000,for the existing wii even cnn's first
QMWlRWnAZH8,442000,443520,impressions article of the wii u
QMWlRWnAZH8,443520,446160,called it a solid accessory that's the
QMWlRWnAZH8,446160,448080,equivalent of saying the playstation 5
QMWlRWnAZH8,448080,450160,is a solid accessory to the playstation
QMWlRWnAZH8,450160,452000,4. cnn
QMWlRWnAZH8,452000,455280,so easy 5 out of 10 fail here the wii u
QMWlRWnAZH8,455280,457120,was a colossal flop
QMWlRWnAZH8,457120,458400,and to be honest if nintendo hadn't
QMWlRWnAZH8,458400,459599,turned things around with the switch
QMWlRWnAZH8,459599,460960,that came after
QMWlRWnAZH8,460960,462000,this could have been the beginning of
QMWlRWnAZH8,462000,463919,the end for them but as we've learned
QMWlRWnAZH8,463919,465360,from these videos
QMWlRWnAZH8,465360,468560,you can always do worse so in 2012
QMWlRWnAZH8,468560,470800,this little box was going viral imagine
QMWlRWnAZH8,470800,472160,this lady telling you that she was
QMWlRWnAZH8,472160,474400,creating a console called the ouya that
QMWlRWnAZH8,474400,476960,for just 99 could play tens of thousands
QMWlRWnAZH8,476960,477599,of games
QMWlRWnAZH8,477599,479919,including minecraft platformers shooters
QMWlRWnAZH8,479919,480720,mostly
QMWlRWnAZH8,480720,483120,for free you'd be pretty excited i mean
QMWlRWnAZH8,483120,484960,just the idea of a console at that kind
QMWlRWnAZH8,484960,485919,of price
QMWlRWnAZH8,485919,487919,is unheard of and so it's almost not
QMWlRWnAZH8,487919,489520,surprising that ouya became
QMWlRWnAZH8,489520,491199,the second most funded project on
QMWlRWnAZH8,491199,492560,kickstarter with almost
QMWlRWnAZH8,492560,495199,nine million dollars behind it but when
QMWlRWnAZH8,495199,496400,we have finally shipped
QMWlRWnAZH8,496400,498080,it became very clear that its biggest
QMWlRWnAZH8,498080,499599,perceived strength
QMWlRWnAZH8,499599,501280,was also kind of its biggest weakness
QMWlRWnAZH8,501280,502800,because it was based on android
QMWlRWnAZH8,502800,504560,yes you were getting tens of thousands
QMWlRWnAZH8,504560,506560,of games but what was kind of glossed
QMWlRWnAZH8,506560,507759,over was the fact that
QMWlRWnAZH8,507759,510479,these were fundamentally games made for
QMWlRWnAZH8,510479,511280,phones
QMWlRWnAZH8,511280,513599,at the time in 2012 very few of them had
QMWlRWnAZH8,513599,514959,good controller support
QMWlRWnAZH8,514959,516159,most of them were just kind of cheaply
QMWlRWnAZH8,516159,518320,made with in-app purchases plus
QMWlRWnAZH8,518320,520080,when you blow up games that were made
QMWlRWnAZH8,520080,522320,for a four-inch 2012 phone screen
QMWlRWnAZH8,522320,524800,to a 40-inch tv people quickly realized
QMWlRWnAZH8,524800,526640,that even calling this a current gen
QMWlRWnAZH8,526640,527839,console was
QMWlRWnAZH8,527839,530480,really a push already now for the smart
QMWlRWnAZH8,530480,531279,home
QMWlRWnAZH8,531279,534880,or in this case the not very smart home
QMWlRWnAZH8,534880,537120,picture this it's 2013. sony's just
QMWlRWnAZH8,537120,538720,announced the playstation 4.
QMWlRWnAZH8,538720,541600,people are showing off their iphone 5cs
QMWlRWnAZH8,541600,542800,jokes on them really
QMWlRWnAZH8,542800,544160,and you feel like making a change in
QMWlRWnAZH8,544160,546640,your life well luckyview
QMWlRWnAZH8,546640,548640,juicero has come up with a machine that
QMWlRWnAZH8,548640,550720,can squeeze you your very own fresh
QMWlRWnAZH8,550720,551120,fruit
QMWlRWnAZH8,551120,553760,juices if you buy the machine for seven
QMWlRWnAZH8,553760,554800,hundred dollars
QMWlRWnAZH8,554800,556800,and then pay a subscription to get these
QMWlRWnAZH8,556800,559040,sachets of cut up fruit to use with it
QMWlRWnAZH8,559040,561040,do you wanna know the funny bit though
QMWlRWnAZH8,561040,562480,you didn't need the machine
QMWlRWnAZH8,562480,564399,bloomberg posted a one minute video
QMWlRWnAZH8,564399,566000,showing how they could actually get the
QMWlRWnAZH8,566000,567279,exact same juice but
QMWlRWnAZH8,567279,569920,faster by squeezing the sachets by hand
QMWlRWnAZH8,569920,571680,and this one minute video
QMWlRWnAZH8,571680,573200,pretty much brought down the entire
QMWlRWnAZH8,573200,574880,operation and
QMWlRWnAZH8,574880,576800,if you are enjoying this video then a
QMWlRWnAZH8,576800,578720,sub to the channel would be
QMWlRWnAZH8,578720,581040,juicy but now is where it starts to get
QMWlRWnAZH8,581040,581839,dangerous
QMWlRWnAZH8,581839,583760,there's a company called june they make
QMWlRWnAZH8,583760,584959,smart ovens and
QMWlRWnAZH8,584959,586640,they have genuinely turned what can
QMWlRWnAZH8,586640,588240,often be a pretty gross appliance
QMWlRWnAZH8,588240,590880,into a piece of art but people quickly
QMWlRWnAZH8,590880,592800,found out that their june ovens
QMWlRWnAZH8,592800,594720,at least the first generation of them
QMWlRWnAZH8,594720,596880,could spontaneously turn themselves on
QMWlRWnAZH8,596880,598720,and start heating up imagine sitting on
QMWlRWnAZH8,598720,600240,your bed at 2am in the middle of the
QMWlRWnAZH8,600240,600720,night
QMWlRWnAZH8,600720,602560,and suddenly your oven just randomly
QMWlRWnAZH8,602560,604160,hits 200 degrees celsius
QMWlRWnAZH8,604160,605839,in the kitchen below with no one there
QMWlRWnAZH8,605839,607519,to oversee it that's
QMWlRWnAZH8,607519,609440,that's kind of scary if there was any
QMWlRWnAZH8,609440,610640,food still left in there
QMWlRWnAZH8,610640,612880,or even really scraps from past meals
QMWlRWnAZH8,612880,614399,that could be enough to start a house
QMWlRWnAZH8,614399,615279,fire
QMWlRWnAZH8,615279,618079,june did fix this with a software update
QMWlRWnAZH8,618079,619040,yikes
QMWlRWnAZH8,619040,621120,you know what's the level above that the
QMWlRWnAZH8,621120,622160,amazon ring
QMWlRWnAZH8,622160,625040,security system no literally a security
QMWlRWnAZH8,625040,625680,system
QMWlRWnAZH8,625680,628640,that puts people at risk good job amazon
QMWlRWnAZH8,628640,629040,see
QMWlRWnAZH8,629040,631279,what happened was these cameras allowed
QMWlRWnAZH8,631279,632800,users to fully see and hear what's
QMWlRWnAZH8,632800,634640,happening in any room at any time
QMWlRWnAZH8,634640,637279,and sure that's incredibly useful but
QMWlRWnAZH8,637279,637920,because
QMWlRWnAZH8,637920,639760,such high level access was only
QMWlRWnAZH8,639760,641360,protected by a simple username and
QMWlRWnAZH8,641360,642720,password
QMWlRWnAZH8,642720,644320,they could be hacked imagine just
QMWlRWnAZH8,644320,645360,sitting there in your living room with
QMWlRWnAZH8,645360,646079,your family
QMWlRWnAZH8,646079,648399,when all of a sudden you hear a voice
QMWlRWnAZH8,648399,650079,coming through your security camera
QMWlRWnAZH8,650079,652959,pay this 50 bitcoin ransom or else you
QMWlRWnAZH8,652959,655040,will get terminated yourself
QMWlRWnAZH8,655040,656880,right now and you realize that this
QMWlRWnAZH8,656880,659120,entire time someone's been watching you
QMWlRWnAZH8,659120,660800,it sounds like something straight out of
QMWlRWnAZH8,660800,662720,a horror movie and what makes this worse
QMWlRWnAZH8,662720,663200,is that
QMWlRWnAZH8,663200,665040,these hackers would threaten and
QMWlRWnAZH8,665040,666399,sometimes even blackmail
QMWlRWnAZH8,666399,668160,the families they were looking at there
QMWlRWnAZH8,668160,669519,was one famous incident where there was
QMWlRWnAZH8,669519,671360,an old lady in an apartment
QMWlRWnAZH8,671360,673600,and a voice said to her tonight you'd
QMWlRWnAZH8,673600,675839,die oh yeah and also the amazon ring
QMWlRWnAZH8,675839,676959,smart doorbells
QMWlRWnAZH8,676959,679440,the accompanying product to the cameras
QMWlRWnAZH8,679440,680000,they
QMWlRWnAZH8,680000,682320,started spontaneously bursting into
QMWlRWnAZH8,682320,683200,flames
QMWlRWnAZH8,683200,685680,so quite the duo i mean obviously this
QMWlRWnAZH8,685680,687200,wasn't amazon's fault and they did
QMWlRWnAZH8,687200,688880,address it with a software update
QMWlRWnAZH8,688880,691920,but what a horrendous oversight okay do
QMWlRWnAZH8,691920,693200,you remember when segways and
QMWlRWnAZH8,693200,695200,hoverboards were like the coolest thing
QMWlRWnAZH8,695200,697600,on the planet
QMWlRWnAZH8,697600,699600,how it finally felt like we'd figured
QMWlRWnAZH8,699600,702160,out a solution to walking
QMWlRWnAZH8,702160,704480,where do they go well we found out the
QMWlRWnAZH8,704480,706240,hard way that segways
QMWlRWnAZH8,706240,708160,we're dangerous you lose focus for just
QMWlRWnAZH8,708160,710399,one second and you're either in a ditch
QMWlRWnAZH8,710399,713040,a road or you've already knocked someone
QMWlRWnAZH8,713040,713519,over
QMWlRWnAZH8,713519,715200,even the president of the united states
QMWlRWnAZH8,715200,716639,was seen falling off one of these
QMWlRWnAZH8,716639,718160,and this right here shows when a
QMWlRWnAZH8,718160,720639,cameraman managed to plow straight into
QMWlRWnAZH8,720639,721760,usain bolt
QMWlRWnAZH8,721760,724800,the world's fastest sprinter or at least
QMWlRWnAZH8,724800,725360,he
QMWlRWnAZH8,725360,727360,was before that it's actually kind of
QMWlRWnAZH8,727360,729040,sad you know the owner of the segway
QMWlRWnAZH8,729040,730720,company in 2010
QMWlRWnAZH8,730720,733360,he actually drove a segway off a cliff
QMWlRWnAZH8,733360,734320,and he died
QMWlRWnAZH8,734320,735680,you know i was actually going to make an
QMWlRWnAZH8,735680,737839,entrance to this video on a segway
QMWlRWnAZH8,737839,739519,but then partway through doing it the
QMWlRWnAZH8,739519,741680,battery ran out and i fell nearly phase
QMWlRWnAZH8,741680,742880,first on the ground
QMWlRWnAZH8,742880,745040,they're dangerous and so it's not really
QMWlRWnAZH8,745040,746639,surprising that a lot of governments
QMWlRWnAZH8,746639,748560,got involved and basically started
QMWlRWnAZH8,748560,750480,banning their use in public spaces
QMWlRWnAZH8,750480,752240,and what really didn't help is that many
QMWlRWnAZH8,752240,753839,of these supposed hoverboards
QMWlRWnAZH8,753839,756160,which let's be honest were just boards
QMWlRWnAZH8,756160,758240,they started catching on fire half a
QMWlRWnAZH8,758240,760320,million of them had to be recalled
QMWlRWnAZH8,760320,762240,which let's face it that's enough to
QMWlRWnAZH8,762240,764079,ruin any potentially up-and-coming
QMWlRWnAZH8,764079,764800,product
QMWlRWnAZH8,764800,767279,so this is definitely a seven out of ten
QMWlRWnAZH8,767279,768000,territory
QMWlRWnAZH8,768000,770320,and that leaves us with a few major
QMWlRWnAZH8,770320,771600,social media fails
QMWlRWnAZH8,771600,774800,leading up to the big number one and
QMWlRWnAZH8,774800,776160,we'll start with our good friends at
QMWlRWnAZH8,776160,778639,facebook okay it's 2018.
QMWlRWnAZH8,778639,780079,facebook has just had one of the biggest
QMWlRWnAZH8,780079,782480,data breaches of all time affecting 50
QMWlRWnAZH8,782480,783440,million users
QMWlRWnAZH8,783440,785360,not to mention arguably the biggest tech
QMWlRWnAZH8,785360,786639,scam of the decade
QMWlRWnAZH8,786639,789120,where users data was extracted from
QMWlRWnAZH8,789120,789839,facebook
QMWlRWnAZH8,789839,791920,to be used for political advertising
QMWlRWnAZH8,791920,794639,what a great time to launch a massive
QMWlRWnAZH8,794639,797120,facebook branded always-on camera screen
QMWlRWnAZH8,797120,798079,and microphone
QMWlRWnAZH8,798079,800560,to sit in people's homes they called it
QMWlRWnAZH8,800560,801360,the facebook
QMWlRWnAZH8,801360,803680,portal it wasn't good in fact it was
QMWlRWnAZH8,803680,805279,actually referred to as the worst tech
QMWlRWnAZH8,805279,806639,device of the year
QMWlRWnAZH8,806639,808800,and it was kind of a turning point for a
QMWlRWnAZH8,808800,810639,lot of people who realized that
QMWlRWnAZH8,810639,813519,they did not trust facebook and what
QMWlRWnAZH8,813519,815120,makes it worse is that in an interview
QMWlRWnAZH8,815120,816639,less than six months later
QMWlRWnAZH8,816639,818720,mark zuckerberg himself when trying to
QMWlRWnAZH8,818720,819680,give an example of what would be
QMWlRWnAZH8,819680,820399,considered
QMWlRWnAZH8,820399,822079,going too far when it comes to the
QMWlRWnAZH8,822079,823920,invasion of privacy he said
QMWlRWnAZH8,823920,825920,we definitely don't want a society where
QMWlRWnAZH8,825920,827279,there's a camera in everyone's living
QMWlRWnAZH8,827279,827760,room
QMWlRWnAZH8,827760,829760,and while we're at it with facebook you
QMWlRWnAZH8,829760,831600,might remember that recent january
QMWlRWnAZH8,831600,833760,whatsapp update they came completely out
QMWlRWnAZH8,833760,835120,of the blue with a notification
QMWlRWnAZH8,835120,836800,saying that their terms of service had
QMWlRWnAZH8,836800,839040,been updated but
QMWlRWnAZH8,839040,840240,they could have worded this a little
QMWlRWnAZH8,840240,842399,better what it came across as was
QMWlRWnAZH8,842399,844480,that this update allowed whatsapp to
QMWlRWnAZH8,844480,846240,share its data with facebook
QMWlRWnAZH8,846240,849040,and people were furious because of
QMWlRWnAZH8,849040,850560,course the implication was that
QMWlRWnAZH8,850560,851920,even when you think you're having a
QMWlRWnAZH8,851920,854240,private chat with someone that data
QMWlRWnAZH8,854240,856800,is not just not private but it's
QMWlRWnAZH8,856800,858000,actually going to be used to give you
QMWlRWnAZH8,858000,858880,even more
QMWlRWnAZH8,858880,861760,scarily accurate adverts now given the
QMWlRWnAZH8,861760,863120,reputation that facebook already had at
QMWlRWnAZH8,863120,864000,this point
QMWlRWnAZH8,864000,866240,they did not need this millions of users
QMWlRWnAZH8,866240,867760,started boycotting whatsapp
QMWlRWnAZH8,867760,870000,and millions not just uninstalled it but
QMWlRWnAZH8,870000,872079,went to competing apps like signal
QMWlRWnAZH8,872079,874079,and got their entire social group to do
QMWlRWnAZH8,874079,875519,the same fun fact
QMWlRWnAZH8,875519,877279,i actually got asked to be on radio here
QMWlRWnAZH8,877279,879760,in the uk just to talk to people about
QMWlRWnAZH8,879760,882160,the best apps they could switch to and
QMWlRWnAZH8,882160,883600,whatsapp did come out afterwards and say
QMWlRWnAZH8,883600,884079,hey
QMWlRWnAZH8,884079,886160,guys it was a misunderstanding we didn't
QMWlRWnAZH8,886160,887920,mean to do that we don't share data with
QMWlRWnAZH8,887920,888959,facebook
QMWlRWnAZH8,888959,891519,but that almost makes it more of a fail
QMWlRWnAZH8,891519,893360,they nuked a massive part of their user
QMWlRWnAZH8,893360,894160,base
QMWlRWnAZH8,894160,896000,just because they couldn't structure
QMWlRWnAZH8,896000,897440,their sentences clearly
QMWlRWnAZH8,897440,900000,so that puts this indefinite seven out
QMWlRWnAZH8,900000,901120,of ten territory
QMWlRWnAZH8,901120,903920,and then we've got youtube we've got a
QMWlRWnAZH8,903920,905519,lot to be grateful for on youtube
QMWlRWnAZH8,905519,906880,i mean they're the only reason that i'm
QMWlRWnAZH8,906880,908480,able to sit here and talk to you like
QMWlRWnAZH8,908480,909040,this
QMWlRWnAZH8,909040,911600,it's amazing but the one thing that i
QMWlRWnAZH8,911600,912720,think we can agree
QMWlRWnAZH8,912720,916320,isn't is rewind so it's become a bit of
QMWlRWnAZH8,916320,918000,a tradition that once per year
QMWlRWnAZH8,918000,919680,youtube creates a mashup of the most
QMWlRWnAZH8,919680,921199,memorable moments that happened on
QMWlRWnAZH8,921199,921920,youtube
QMWlRWnAZH8,921920,924240,and people used to love it just being
QMWlRWnAZH8,924240,926000,able to see your favorite influencers
QMWlRWnAZH8,926000,926560,who
QMWlRWnAZH8,926560,928320,never normally would have interacted
QMWlRWnAZH8,928320,930000,dancing together in a room
QMWlRWnAZH8,930000,931920,it's like a really fun version of an
QMWlRWnAZH8,931920,933120,award ceremony
QMWlRWnAZH8,933120,935759,but youtube has progressively killed
QMWlRWnAZH8,935759,936800,that sentiment
QMWlRWnAZH8,936800,939440,instead of the usual 95 like to dislike
QMWlRWnAZH8,939440,940240,ratio
QMWlRWnAZH8,940240,943360,as soon as we hit 2016 people started
QMWlRWnAZH8,943360,945440,disliking rewind this video had
QMWlRWnAZH8,945440,946800,something like 87
QMWlRWnAZH8,946800,948720,likes which is enough to know that
QMWlRWnAZH8,948720,949839,something's off
QMWlRWnAZH8,949839,952959,but then 2017 had 68
QMWlRWnAZH8,952959,956720,likes and 2018 had 13.8
QMWlRWnAZH8,956720,959199,likes and it's still the most disliked
QMWlRWnAZH8,959199,959839,video
QMWlRWnAZH8,959839,962160,on the entire internet how does youtube
QMWlRWnAZH8,962160,962959,themselves
QMWlRWnAZH8,962959,965920,go that wrong well it seems like the
QMWlRWnAZH8,965920,966800,answer is that
QMWlRWnAZH8,966800,968720,they've become disconnected from their
QMWlRWnAZH8,968720,971360,creators like this 2018 rewind it
QMWlRWnAZH8,971360,972079,started
QMWlRWnAZH8,972079,974560,with will smith who youtube probably got
QMWlRWnAZH8,974560,975519,in there because they thought
QMWlRWnAZH8,975519,977360,well this will make us seem legit
QMWlRWnAZH8,977360,978720,fortnite
QMWlRWnAZH8,978720,980880,and marquez brownlee but actually
QMWlRWnAZH8,980880,982560,everyone watching this was just thinking
QMWlRWnAZH8,982560,985600,why is will smith actor in a youtube
QMWlRWnAZH8,985600,987759,rewind and the whole video just went on
QMWlRWnAZH8,987759,988959,about a bunch of stuff that
QMWlRWnAZH8,988959,991440,was kind of significant but it ignored
QMWlRWnAZH8,991440,993040,an alarming amount of the really big
QMWlRWnAZH8,993040,994800,stuff
QMWlRWnAZH8,994800,997360,maybe youtube just wants youtube to seem
QMWlRWnAZH8,997360,999360,like a really family-friendly platform
QMWlRWnAZH8,999360,1001440,and so they skipped over all the drama
QMWlRWnAZH8,1001440,1002639,and the controversy
QMWlRWnAZH8,1002639,1004320,but as far as the viewer and as far as
QMWlRWnAZH8,1004320,1005680,the creators are concerned
QMWlRWnAZH8,1005680,1008880,that's what makes youtube youtube and so
QMWlRWnAZH8,1008880,1010720,rewind starts to feel less like a
QMWlRWnAZH8,1010720,1012320,one-off super special video that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1012320,1013920,everyone got amped up for
QMWlRWnAZH8,1013920,1016399,more just like a feel-good pg-rated
QMWlRWnAZH8,1016399,1016959,trailer
QMWlRWnAZH8,1016959,1019600,for youtube as a service and don't even
QMWlRWnAZH8,1019600,1022000,get me started on the 2019 rewind which
QMWlRWnAZH8,1022000,1023680,was just a countdown of videos that did
QMWlRWnAZH8,1023680,1024240,well
QMWlRWnAZH8,1024240,1028720,and the 2021 it didn't actually happen
QMWlRWnAZH8,1028720,1030880,so you know it feels like everyone under
QMWlRWnAZH8,1030880,1032798,the age of 30 is on instagram and tick
QMWlRWnAZH8,1032798,1033760,tock right now
QMWlRWnAZH8,1033760,1036480,well in some alternate universe they'd
QMWlRWnAZH8,1036480,1037520,all be on an app
QMWlRWnAZH8,1037520,1039918,called quibby it stands for quick bytes
QMWlRWnAZH8,1039918,1042000,and it was meant to be the netflix
QMWlRWnAZH8,1042000,1043839,for the up and coming generation where
QMWlRWnAZH8,1043839,1045600,it was still big budget content
QMWlRWnAZH8,1045600,1048000,but capped at 10 minutes in length the
QMWlRWnAZH8,1048000,1049120,idea being that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1049120,1051600,more and more we're consuming content in
QMWlRWnAZH8,1051600,1052799,shorter bursts
QMWlRWnAZH8,1052799,1054799,we are less about now sitting down for
QMWlRWnAZH8,1054799,1056400,two hours at a time watching an entire
QMWlRWnAZH8,1056400,1057200,film
QMWlRWnAZH8,1057200,1059440,more about spending 10 minutes here
QMWlRWnAZH8,1059440,1060960,watching a couple of tick tock videos
QMWlRWnAZH8,1060960,1062640,spending 10 minutes here flicking
QMWlRWnAZH8,1062640,1064400,through an instagram feed so
QMWlRWnAZH8,1064400,1067120,this was quality tv built to replace
QMWlRWnAZH8,1067120,1068160,that time
QMWlRWnAZH8,1068160,1070400,and it was packing heat it was led by
QMWlRWnAZH8,1070400,1071200,meg whitman
QMWlRWnAZH8,1071200,1074400,ex-ceo of hp and jeffrey katzenberg
QMWlRWnAZH8,1074400,1076960,chairman of walt disney studios and
QMWlRWnAZH8,1076960,1077760,together
QMWlRWnAZH8,1077760,1080240,these guys managed to raise 1.7 billion
QMWlRWnAZH8,1080240,1082400,dollars in funding
QMWlRWnAZH8,1082400,1084799,the failure came though because this was
QMWlRWnAZH8,1084799,1085600,like an
QMWlRWnAZH8,1085600,1087840,older person's view of what younger
QMWlRWnAZH8,1087840,1088799,people want
QMWlRWnAZH8,1088799,1091600,it was built for the 20 to 35 age group
QMWlRWnAZH8,1091600,1092160,but by
QMWlRWnAZH8,1092160,1095200,people who are over 60 what they needed
QMWlRWnAZH8,1095200,1096960,to do was to get those same youtubers
QMWlRWnAZH8,1096960,1098640,and tick tockers that this generation
QMWlRWnAZH8,1098640,1099600,was engaging with
QMWlRWnAZH8,1099600,1101600,to create special high production value
QMWlRWnAZH8,1101600,1102799,content for them
QMWlRWnAZH8,1102799,1105280,but what they actually did was to just
QMWlRWnAZH8,1105280,1106960,get a whole load of a-list hollywood
QMWlRWnAZH8,1106960,1108160,celebrities instead
QMWlRWnAZH8,1108160,1110400,it was a star-studded cast don't get me
QMWlRWnAZH8,1110400,1112320,wrong but i think they misjudged their
QMWlRWnAZH8,1112320,1113039,audience
QMWlRWnAZH8,1113039,1114720,and i also think that they somewhat
QMWlRWnAZH8,1114720,1116400,devalued their own product
QMWlRWnAZH8,1116400,1118960,by capping it at 10 minutes because as
QMWlRWnAZH8,1118960,1120720,densely packed with celebrities as these
QMWlRWnAZH8,1120720,1121679,videos were
QMWlRWnAZH8,1121679,1123760,we've kind of got used to the idea of
QMWlRWnAZH8,1123760,1125679,not paying for short video
QMWlRWnAZH8,1125679,1128320,so within seven months of launching qibi
QMWlRWnAZH8,1128320,1129120,flopped
QMWlRWnAZH8,1129120,1131600,and with it the 1.7 billion dollars they
QMWlRWnAZH8,1131600,1133360,managed to raise
QMWlRWnAZH8,1133360,1135039,gone and to just give you some context
QMWlRWnAZH8,1135039,1136480,on how much money that is
QMWlRWnAZH8,1136480,1138640,it's enough to build a bridge halfway
QMWlRWnAZH8,1138640,1139840,around the world
QMWlRWnAZH8,1139840,1143440,made only of playstation 5 consoles
QMWlRWnAZH8,1143440,1145200,yes these are the kinds of examples my
QMWlRWnAZH8,1145200,1146960,brain comes up with but now we are
QMWlRWnAZH8,1146960,1147840,stepping it up
QMWlRWnAZH8,1147840,1150240,another level because in july of last
QMWlRWnAZH8,1150240,1151520,year
QMWlRWnAZH8,1151520,1154240,there was a hacking 130 of the most
QMWlRWnAZH8,1154240,1156000,high-profile twitter accounts
QMWlRWnAZH8,1156000,1158400,were hacked in one go we're talking
QMWlRWnAZH8,1158400,1160480,people like barack obama bill gates
QMWlRWnAZH8,1160480,1162799,jeff bezos but also youtubers like mr
QMWlRWnAZH8,1162799,1163520,beast
QMWlRWnAZH8,1163520,1165600,even the official apple account but it's
QMWlRWnAZH8,1165600,1167120,worse than that it's not just that these
QMWlRWnAZH8,1167120,1168559,hackers gained access to these guys
QMWlRWnAZH8,1168559,1169360,accounts
QMWlRWnAZH8,1169360,1171520,it's that they actively use them to scam
QMWlRWnAZH8,1171520,1172480,their followers
QMWlRWnAZH8,1172480,1174240,what they said to people was if you send
QMWlRWnAZH8,1174240,1176240,us some bitcoin we'll send you back
QMWlRWnAZH8,1176240,1178080,twice as much and because these tweets
QMWlRWnAZH8,1178080,1179919,were coming from verified accounts that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1179919,1180799,people trust
QMWlRWnAZH8,1180799,1182000,i guess their audiences must have just
QMWlRWnAZH8,1182000,1184160,thought we've hit the jackpot they were
QMWlRWnAZH8,1184160,1186000,throwing money in their direction
QMWlRWnAZH8,1186000,1187919,and because it's bitcoin we're talking
QMWlRWnAZH8,1187919,1189760,about these transactions
QMWlRWnAZH8,1189760,1192320,are irreversible so which group of
QMWlRWnAZH8,1192320,1195120,masterminds came up with this
QMWlRWnAZH8,1195120,1197120,three teenagers and thankfully all they
QMWlRWnAZH8,1197120,1198960,wanted was to earn some quick money
QMWlRWnAZH8,1198960,1199520,because
QMWlRWnAZH8,1199520,1201039,if this was done by someone with more
QMWlRWnAZH8,1201039,1203200,malicious intentions with that kind of
QMWlRWnAZH8,1203200,1203760,power
QMWlRWnAZH8,1203760,1206000,the ability to speak on behalf of anyone
QMWlRWnAZH8,1206000,1207280,in the world
QMWlRWnAZH8,1207280,1210000,you could start a war so eight out of
QMWlRWnAZH8,1210000,1211600,ten fail for this one
QMWlRWnAZH8,1211600,1214640,now in any list of tech fails made in
QMWlRWnAZH8,1214640,1216080,2021
QMWlRWnAZH8,1216080,1218240,we can't not talk about cyberpunk for
QMWlRWnAZH8,1218240,1219600,those of you who don't know about it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1219600,1222000,this was the biggest most hyped video
QMWlRWnAZH8,1222000,1224000,game of the entire decade
QMWlRWnAZH8,1224000,1225360,it only just released a couple of months
QMWlRWnAZH8,1225360,1227520,ago but we've been seeing trailers of it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1227520,1230559,since 2013. and sure i mean if it's that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1230559,1231520,revolutionary
QMWlRWnAZH8,1231520,1233280,we'll wait seven years after seeing the
QMWlRWnAZH8,1233280,1235039,first trailer but
QMWlRWnAZH8,1235039,1236720,this wasn't that and i don't think
QMWlRWnAZH8,1236720,1238159,anybody would have predicted
QMWlRWnAZH8,1238159,1240159,how badly it was gonna backfire in a
QMWlRWnAZH8,1240159,1241760,very best case scenario
QMWlRWnAZH8,1241760,1244240,you got a buggy mess we're talking
QMWlRWnAZH8,1244240,1245679,random teleportations
QMWlRWnAZH8,1245679,1247600,ridiculous graphical glitches people
QMWlRWnAZH8,1247600,1248960,flying through walls and
QMWlRWnAZH8,1248960,1250240,pretty much everything else you can
QMWlRWnAZH8,1250240,1252080,think of but worse still
QMWlRWnAZH8,1252080,1253760,if you bought this game on a last gen
QMWlRWnAZH8,1253760,1255679,playstation 4 or xbox one
QMWlRWnAZH8,1255679,1258559,which i imagine most people did then it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1258559,1259039,looked
QMWlRWnAZH8,1259039,1261039,and ran about as good as me after
QMWlRWnAZH8,1261039,1262400,ubereats went 50
QMWlRWnAZH8,1262400,1264640,off and it's not just the fact that when
QMWlRWnAZH8,1264640,1266320,this game launched it wasn't even close
QMWlRWnAZH8,1266320,1267200,to ready
QMWlRWnAZH8,1267200,1269120,it's the fact that the company behind it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1269120,1270720,cd projekt red
QMWlRWnAZH8,1270720,1272799,they tried to hide it they restricted
QMWlRWnAZH8,1272799,1274159,access to early copies
QMWlRWnAZH8,1274159,1276480,so reviewers couldn't even warn people
QMWlRWnAZH8,1276480,1278320,so you can probably imagine that when
QMWlRWnAZH8,1278320,1279760,all of this became public
QMWlRWnAZH8,1279760,1282080,their stock price plummeted they got
QMWlRWnAZH8,1282080,1283600,demolished on social media
QMWlRWnAZH8,1283600,1285600,they had multiple class-action lawsuits
QMWlRWnAZH8,1285600,1286640,filed against them
QMWlRWnAZH8,1286640,1289760,but the worst bit these guys were
QMWlRWnAZH8,1289760,1291200,maliciously hacked
QMWlRWnAZH8,1291200,1292960,and it's tough to say for sure whether
QMWlRWnAZH8,1292960,1294480,this was linked to the game or not
QMWlRWnAZH8,1294480,1296080,but it would be a pretty huge
QMWlRWnAZH8,1296080,1297919,coincidence if not someone got into
QMWlRWnAZH8,1297919,1299440,their service and basically took
QMWlRWnAZH8,1299440,1301200,every bit of secretive data they could
QMWlRWnAZH8,1301200,1303440,find info about how the company runs
QMWlRWnAZH8,1303440,1304799,their employees their
QMWlRWnAZH8,1304799,1307440,accounts and even the source code of the
QMWlRWnAZH8,1307440,1307919,game
QMWlRWnAZH8,1307919,1309600,which can be used to create an unlimited
QMWlRWnAZH8,1309600,1311360,number of new copies of it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1311360,1313440,and then the hackers sold all that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1313440,1314480,information
QMWlRWnAZH8,1314480,1316480,cyberpunk is the biggest video game
QMWlRWnAZH8,1316480,1319280,disaster that i've ever seen in my life
QMWlRWnAZH8,1319280,1322080,9 out of 10 fail now we've already seen
QMWlRWnAZH8,1322080,1323840,some alarming things on this list
QMWlRWnAZH8,1323840,1326559,some things that might worry you but
QMWlRWnAZH8,1326559,1327760,imagine you're worried
QMWlRWnAZH8,1327760,1329520,if you saw this message pop up on your
QMWlRWnAZH8,1329520,1331360,phone ballistic missile threat
QMWlRWnAZH8,1331360,1334159,inbound to hawaii seek immediate shelter
QMWlRWnAZH8,1334159,1335280,this is not a drill
QMWlRWnAZH8,1335280,1336799,this was a message that was sent one day
QMWlRWnAZH8,1336799,1339039,in 2018 to every tv
QMWlRWnAZH8,1339039,1341919,radio and smartphone in hawaii people
QMWlRWnAZH8,1341919,1343840,were already on edge as tensions had
QMWlRWnAZH8,1343840,1345919,been mounting for years with north korea
QMWlRWnAZH8,1345919,1346480,and
QMWlRWnAZH8,1346480,1348880,both countries did have nuclear weapons
QMWlRWnAZH8,1348880,1350159,so this was a very
QMWlRWnAZH8,1350159,1352960,real threat people must have been losing
QMWlRWnAZH8,1352960,1355039,their minds
QMWlRWnAZH8,1355039,1356799,but it was a mistake the entire thing
QMWlRWnAZH8,1356799,1358799,was just one internal miscommunication
QMWlRWnAZH8,1358799,1360080,in the hawaii emergency
QMWlRWnAZH8,1360080,1363840,facility and it took them 38 minutes
QMWlRWnAZH8,1363840,1366000,38 of probably the most frantic hellish
QMWlRWnAZH8,1366000,1367840,minutes of these hawaiians lives
QMWlRWnAZH8,1367840,1370400,for them to correct it okay just before
QMWlRWnAZH8,1370400,1371360,the big number one
QMWlRWnAZH8,1371360,1373360,i do have a full series on this channel
QMWlRWnAZH8,1373360,1375039,just about smartphone fails
QMWlRWnAZH8,1375039,1377039,i'll leave that link down below and let
QMWlRWnAZH8,1377039,1378400,me know if you've got like a favorite
QMWlRWnAZH8,1378400,1379840,tech fail that you'd want to see in the
QMWlRWnAZH8,1379840,1381840,next episode of this series
QMWlRWnAZH8,1381840,1384640,so number one and this is the first time
QMWlRWnAZH8,1384640,1386240,that i've ever awarded a fail
QMWlRWnAZH8,1386240,1388159,anything above a 9 out of ten we're
QMWlRWnAZH8,1388159,1389840,talking about
QMWlRWnAZH8,1389840,1392480,thoroughness and all you're thinking not
QMWlRWnAZH8,1392480,1393440,thanos
QMWlRWnAZH8,1393440,1395120,let me introduce you to a lady called
QMWlRWnAZH8,1395120,1396880,elizabeth holmes who
QMWlRWnAZH8,1396880,1399440,saw an opportunity in medical tech she
QMWlRWnAZH8,1399440,1401200,realized that the current way blood was
QMWlRWnAZH8,1401200,1403919,being tested for diseases and cancers
QMWlRWnAZH8,1403919,1406159,was super inefficient because every
QMWlRWnAZH8,1406159,1408159,single test scientists wanted to do
QMWlRWnAZH8,1408159,1411200,required a separate vial of blood so she
QMWlRWnAZH8,1411200,1412480,basically created a machine
QMWlRWnAZH8,1412480,1414240,that could just take one tiny blood
QMWlRWnAZH8,1414240,1415679,sample and with that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1415679,1419120,do over 240 tests on it all at once
QMWlRWnAZH8,1419120,1421360,all at a fraction of the cost this could
QMWlRWnAZH8,1421360,1422320,have changed medicine
QMWlRWnAZH8,1422320,1424080,forever this could have changed every
QMWlRWnAZH8,1424080,1425440,single one of our lives
QMWlRWnAZH8,1425440,1428559,this woman was a hero an inspiration she
QMWlRWnAZH8,1428559,1429600,was often referred to
QMWlRWnAZH8,1429600,1431440,as the female steve jobs because of how
QMWlRWnAZH8,1431440,1432960,she loved these turtlenecks
QMWlRWnAZH8,1432960,1436159,her company reached a valuation of nine
QMWlRWnAZH8,1436159,1438799,billion dollars think of the ps5 bridge
QMWlRWnAZH8,1438799,1440400,you could build with that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1440400,1443360,but it was all founded on lies right
QMWlRWnAZH8,1443360,1444559,from the very beginning
QMWlRWnAZH8,1444559,1446799,this machine did not do what she said it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1446799,1448799,did she claimed to investors that it had
QMWlRWnAZH8,1448799,1450080,been used in the military
QMWlRWnAZH8,1450080,1451679,and that it had been used in emergency
QMWlRWnAZH8,1451679,1453840,rooms but it hadn't
QMWlRWnAZH8,1453840,1455919,this theronis company they didn't even
QMWlRWnAZH8,1455919,1457600,themselves use these machines
QMWlRWnAZH8,1457600,1459200,they would tell these investors yeah
QMWlRWnAZH8,1459200,1460799,sure of course we can give you a demo of
QMWlRWnAZH8,1460799,1461520,our tech
QMWlRWnAZH8,1461520,1463440,and they would take their blood samples
QMWlRWnAZH8,1463440,1464640,go into a back room
QMWlRWnAZH8,1464640,1466720,and test it using conventional methods
QMWlRWnAZH8,1466720,1467840,come back in
QMWlRWnAZH8,1467840,1469600,and claim their machines had done it so
QMWlRWnAZH8,1469600,1471120,anyone who'd actually used one of these
QMWlRWnAZH8,1471120,1472799,machines to get their blood results
QMWlRWnAZH8,1472799,1475520,was very likely misdiagnosed and when
QMWlRWnAZH8,1475520,1477360,you think of the severity of being told
QMWlRWnAZH8,1477360,1479520,that you have cancer when you don't
QMWlRWnAZH8,1479520,1481039,or even worse being told that you don't
QMWlRWnAZH8,1481039,1483760,when you do this is bad
QMWlRWnAZH8,1483760,1485600,so bad that the entire company had to
QMWlRWnAZH8,1485600,1487120,shut down so bad that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1487120,1490080,elizabeth holmes is on trial so bad that
QMWlRWnAZH8,1490080,1491840,there's an award-winning documentary
QMWlRWnAZH8,1491840,1494320,made about her scam and even apparently
QMWlRWnAZH8,1494320,1496320,an entire feature film in the works with
QMWlRWnAZH8,1496320,1498240,jennifer lawrence playing as her
QMWlRWnAZH8,1498240,1500080,i think this is worthy of a 10 out of 10
QMWlRWnAZH8,1500080,1501440,fail okay
QMWlRWnAZH8,1501440,1503520,by the time i finish this sentence you
QMWlRWnAZH8,1503520,1504559,have watched me make
QMWlRWnAZH8,1504559,1507440,my very own thai green curry that's
QMWlRWnAZH8,1507440,1508159,literally it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1508159,1509919,you get your heel powder you mix it into
QMWlRWnAZH8,1509919,1511360,hot water cover it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1511360,1513840,and leave it for five minutes this is
QMWlRWnAZH8,1513840,1515679,not a protein shake or a liquid meal
QMWlRWnAZH8,1515679,1516400,replacement
QMWlRWnAZH8,1516400,1518480,it is an actual meal that you can have
QMWlRWnAZH8,1518480,1519760,for lunch or dinner
QMWlRWnAZH8,1519760,1522240,made from brown rice quinoa pea protein
QMWlRWnAZH8,1522240,1523760,flaxseed coconuts
QMWlRWnAZH8,1523760,1525760,just good ingredients and if you didn't
QMWlRWnAZH8,1525760,1527440,know i've actually been having fuel
QMWlRWnAZH8,1527440,1529440,myself for four years before the company
QMWlRWnAZH8,1529440,1530400,actually reached out and wanted to
QMWlRWnAZH8,1530400,1531440,sponsor a video
QMWlRWnAZH8,1531440,1534000,because fundamentally it fits well in my
QMWlRWnAZH8,1534000,1534640,life
QMWlRWnAZH8,1534640,1537120,i care about my health but i just don't
QMWlRWnAZH8,1537120,1538000,have the time
QMWlRWnAZH8,1538000,1540720,or arguably the skills to manually cook
QMWlRWnAZH8,1540720,1542080,three full meals a day
QMWlRWnAZH8,1542080,1543840,so give it a try i've left a special
QMWlRWnAZH8,1543840,1545520,link below and if you click that link it
QMWlRWnAZH8,1545520,1546880,will not just help to support the
QMWlRWnAZH8,1546880,1547360,channel
QMWlRWnAZH8,1547360,1549360,but if you do decide to buy heel you
QMWlRWnAZH8,1549360,1551520,will get not just the heel but also two
QMWlRWnAZH8,1551520,1553520,scoops a pot to cook it in
QMWlRWnAZH8,1553520,1556159,and a free heel t-shirt they are really
