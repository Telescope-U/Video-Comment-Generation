_WOLtIM2dIU,30,3000,I'm dr. vandana doin ire and I'm a
_WOLtIM2dIU,3000,5670,kidney doctor at Emory the video you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,5670,7849,about to watch is going to discuss the
_WOLtIM2dIU,7849,11190,different options available for you when
_WOLtIM2dIU,11190,13049,you need any kind of renal replacement
_WOLtIM2dIU,13049,16920,therapy including transplant peritoneal
_WOLtIM2dIU,16920,21230,dialysis or hemodialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,24070,26590,we usually check the kidney function by
_WOLtIM2dIU,26590,28960,blood work and we can easily tell what
_WOLtIM2dIU,28960,30790,percentage of kidney function is
_WOLtIM2dIU,30790,33670,remaining by a simple equation when your
_WOLtIM2dIU,33670,36850,kidney function gets to around 20% your
_WOLtIM2dIU,36850,39370,doctor will discuss different options
_WOLtIM2dIU,39370,41460,for renal replacement therapy
_WOLtIM2dIU,41460,45249,[Music]
_WOLtIM2dIU,45580,48400,so a kidney transplant is really
_WOLtIM2dIU,48400,50020,important to discuss right at the
_WOLtIM2dIU,50020,51760,beginning when you get diagnosed with
_WOLtIM2dIU,51760,54490,severe kidney dysfunction either chronic
_WOLtIM2dIU,54490,56489,kidney disease stage four or five
_WOLtIM2dIU,56489,59500,because a kidney transplant is one
_WOLtIM2dIU,59500,61840,option that does provide the best
_WOLtIM2dIU,61840,64838,quality of life as well as patients live
_WOLtIM2dIU,64838,67960,longer more productive lives a kidney
_WOLtIM2dIU,67960,71050,transplant is a surgery where a healthy
_WOLtIM2dIU,71050,74350,kidney from a donor either someone who
_WOLtIM2dIU,74350,77410,is living related or unrelated to you or
_WOLtIM2dIU,77410,79960,a deceased donor someone who's passed
_WOLtIM2dIU,79960,82630,away but had a healthy kidney is taken
_WOLtIM2dIU,82630,85330,and placed into your body and it works
_WOLtIM2dIU,85330,87960,just like your own natural kidney would
_WOLtIM2dIU,87960,90759,however the big issue with the deceased
_WOLtIM2dIU,90759,93369,donor transplant is that it can take
_WOLtIM2dIU,93369,95740,sometimes five to eight years in the
_WOLtIM2dIU,95740,98320,state of Georgia to get the right kidney
_WOLtIM2dIU,98320,100630,and so it's important to discuss this
_WOLtIM2dIU,100630,103060,early with your doctor as well as to
_WOLtIM2dIU,103060,104619,discuss with your family and friends
_WOLtIM2dIU,104619,108399,because a living donor transplant does
_WOLtIM2dIU,108399,110619,have better outcomes than a deceased
_WOLtIM2dIU,110619,115810,donor transplant what I feel is good
_WOLtIM2dIU,115810,118690,about transplant is it's life-changing
_WOLtIM2dIU,118690,121350,and I would recommend it for anyone
_WOLtIM2dIU,121350,125649,because when it works is great it's I
_WOLtIM2dIU,125649,128950,know many many people who receive
_WOLtIM2dIU,128950,130660,transplants and it has worked
_WOLtIM2dIU,130660,133420,beautifully for you have to take the
_WOLtIM2dIU,133420,137860,medication reach it religiously is it's
_WOLtIM2dIU,137860,140440,just something you have to do and at a
_WOLtIM2dIU,140440,142360,minimum if that's all I have to do is
_WOLtIM2dIU,142360,144849,take medication that's that's the easy
_WOLtIM2dIU,144849,149080,part to me that's that's the simplest
_WOLtIM2dIU,149080,152319,thing in the world is to you know take a
_WOLtIM2dIU,152319,156550,few medications every day as I said the
_WOLtIM2dIU,156550,159430,hard part with transplant is is the
_WOLtIM2dIU,159430,160650,waiting
_WOLtIM2dIU,160650,162900,and then when they call you you know
_WOLtIM2dIU,162900,170489,this is thrilling is nervousness you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,170489,173519,scared with a work with won't work will
_WOLtIM2dIU,173519,176730,I get it but you know you go through a
_WOLtIM2dIU,176730,179280,ton of emotion smoke when you get it and
_WOLtIM2dIU,179280,184080,it works it's life changing its life all
_WOLtIM2dIU,184080,186530,eternity
_WOLtIM2dIU,189629,192150,peritoneal dialysis is a form of
_WOLtIM2dIU,192150,195870,dialysis where we use your body's own
_WOLtIM2dIU,195870,198930,filter that's it's a membrane that's in
_WOLtIM2dIU,198930,200719,all of our bodies called the peritoneum
_WOLtIM2dIU,200719,204510,so instead of bringing the blood out of
_WOLtIM2dIU,204510,207180,the body to be cleaned in hemodialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,207180,210030,we bring the dialysis fluid into the
_WOLtIM2dIU,210030,212670,body when you're performing peritoneal
_WOLtIM2dIU,212670,214889,dialysis you actually have two options
_WOLtIM2dIU,214889,216870,as to how you perform the peritoneal
_WOLtIM2dIU,216870,220260,dialysis there's one called CA PD which
_WOLtIM2dIU,220260,223139,means continuous ambulatory peritoneal
_WOLtIM2dIU,223139,227040,dialysis and all that means is is you
_WOLtIM2dIU,227040,228959,can get up and walk around while you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,228959,231120,getting your dialysis is typically the
_WOLtIM2dIU,231120,233129,procedure takes anywhere from twenty to
_WOLtIM2dIU,233129,235769,thirty minutes you do it four times a
_WOLtIM2dIU,235769,238260,day spread out over 24 hours so we
_WOLtIM2dIU,238260,241349,usually tell patients it's breakfast
_WOLtIM2dIU,241349,243540,lunch supper bedtime we don't expect you
_WOLtIM2dIU,243540,245519,to stop what you're doing you fit it
_WOLtIM2dIU,245519,248699,into your day and then there's a PD
_WOLtIM2dIU,248699,251370,which is automated peritoneal dialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,251370,252989,and that's where instead of performing
_WOLtIM2dIU,252989,255900,the dialysis during the day and then
_WOLtIM2dIU,255900,259409,sleeping at night you actually set up a
_WOLtIM2dIU,259409,262770,little cycler machine that's like 20 27
_WOLtIM2dIU,262770,264630,pounds that sits on your bedside table
_WOLtIM2dIU,264630,267240,you hook up to that when you go to bed
_WOLtIM2dIU,267240,269849,and it actually runs the fluid in and
_WOLtIM2dIU,269849,271320,out at night while you sleep
_WOLtIM2dIU,271320,274080,I do the I do the cycler at night I
_WOLtIM2dIU,274080,277500,don't do the manual exchanges going to
_WOLtIM2dIU,277500,280259,bed at night and being connected with
_WOLtIM2dIU,280259,282659,that machine is it's not something that
_WOLtIM2dIU,282659,286949,you feel there's no noise connected or
_WOLtIM2dIU,286949,288840,anything you know and you get up in the
_WOLtIM2dIU,288840,291240,morning and your system has been cleaned
_WOLtIM2dIU,291240,294840,and you're you're good to go for the you
_WOLtIM2dIU,294840,296669,know for the entire day to go about your
_WOLtIM2dIU,296669,298340,life to do whatever you want to do
_WOLtIM2dIU,298340,303330,without having to stop or clean your day
_WOLtIM2dIU,303330,305669,around your dialysis because it's all
_WOLtIM2dIU,305669,309360,been done for you while you slept some
_WOLtIM2dIU,309360,311039,of the advantages are number one you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,311039,313560,getting dialysis 24 hours a day seven
_WOLtIM2dIU,313560,315990,days a week so there's no ups and downs
_WOLtIM2dIU,315990,318960,there's no recovery time you hopefully
_WOLtIM2dIU,318960,321200,feel good all the time
_WOLtIM2dIU,321200,323780,it's easy to travel we don't have to
_WOLtIM2dIU,323780,325760,have a clinic and arrange for you to go
_WOLtIM2dIU,325760,328430,have dialysis at that clinic you just
_WOLtIM2dIU,328430,330170,have like a backup if you got into
_WOLtIM2dIU,330170,332900,trouble your supplies are shipped to
_WOLtIM2dIU,332900,335900,where you're going so that they're
_WOLtIM2dIU,335900,337760,already there when you leave so all you
_WOLtIM2dIU,337760,339860,have to do is get to your location and
_WOLtIM2dIU,339860,342020,your dialysis supplies are already there
_WOLtIM2dIU,342020,344690,there are no needles the only needle is
_WOLtIM2dIU,344690,346910,the one blood draw that we do a month so
_WOLtIM2dIU,346910,348980,there's no sticking it's just connecting
_WOLtIM2dIU,348980,351820,to a catheter
_WOLtIM2dIU,354389,357270,and hemodialysis the word Hien means
_WOLtIM2dIU,357270,360030,blood so that means we're going to clean
_WOLtIM2dIU,360030,363030,the blood by taking it out of the body
_WOLtIM2dIU,363030,365250,and running it through an artificial
_WOLtIM2dIU,365250,367139,filter that's already been made in
_WOLtIM2dIU,367139,369659,comparison to the peritoneal dialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,369659,372750,where we use the body's membrane so the
_WOLtIM2dIU,372750,374879,blood taken out of the body and run
_WOLtIM2dIU,374879,376919,through these little fibers that are
_WOLtIM2dIU,376919,379800,bathed with a dialysis solution that
_WOLtIM2dIU,379800,381900,draws the poisons out and the extra
_WOLtIM2dIU,381900,384810,water out of the blood
_WOLtIM2dIU,384810,387009,[Music]
_WOLtIM2dIU,387009,391629,there are many ways to do hemodialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,391629,394589,one is what we call in center
_WOLtIM2dIU,394589,396819,hemodialysis where you come into the
_WOLtIM2dIU,396819,398649,clinic where you have staff that
_WOLtIM2dIU,398649,402389,actually put the needles in your access
_WOLtIM2dIU,402389,405550,connect you to the Machine and filter
_WOLtIM2dIU,405550,408219,the blood outside the body people that
_WOLtIM2dIU,408219,410430,go in center run three times a week
_WOLtIM2dIU,410430,413589,usually an average treatment time would
_WOLtIM2dIU,413589,415599,be four hours so they come Monday
_WOLtIM2dIU,415599,417249,Wednesday Friday Tuesday Thursday
_WOLtIM2dIU,417249,419589,Saturday it you're gonna fit to the
_WOLtIM2dIU,419589,421599,clinic schedule you've got somebody
_WOLtIM2dIU,421599,424360,you've gotten trained medical staff with
_WOLtIM2dIU,424360,426370,you all the time they're performing the
_WOLtIM2dIU,426370,428499,dialysis with you so if you have
_WOLtIM2dIU,428499,430120,questions they're going to be right
_WOLtIM2dIU,430120,432999,there to answer them if you got into any
_WOLtIM2dIU,432999,434620,kind of medical issues they're going to
_WOLtIM2dIU,434620,436599,be right there because you're only
_WOLtIM2dIU,436599,439089,getting your dialysis three times a week
_WOLtIM2dIU,439089,442180,they have to remove all the poisons and
_WOLtIM2dIU,442180,445509,all the fluid in those four hours so
_WOLtIM2dIU,445509,448330,those treatments typically are going to
_WOLtIM2dIU,448330,451149,be faster and a little bit draining on
_WOLtIM2dIU,451149,453490,your system depending on how much fluid
_WOLtIM2dIU,453490,455529,you gain what are the biggest advantages
_WOLtIM2dIU,455529,458589,to insert or hemodialysis is contact
_WOLtIM2dIU,458589,461050,with other dialysis patients they form a
_WOLtIM2dIU,461050,463539,little family you get to know your
_WOLtIM2dIU,463539,464889,neighbors that are going through the
_WOLtIM2dIU,464889,467709,same thing you're going through and it's
_WOLtIM2dIU,467709,469629,like a family environment in your little
_WOLtIM2dIU,469629,472830,Bay and who sits by
_WOLtIM2dIU,475560,478870,another hemodialysis that is available
_WOLtIM2dIU,478870,483460,is called nocturnal dialysis and on that
_WOLtIM2dIU,483460,485320,that is where you can come into the
_WOLtIM2dIU,485320,489040,clinic at night typically they come in
_WOLtIM2dIU,489040,492250,around 7:00 or 8:00 at night and run six
_WOLtIM2dIU,492250,495280,to eight hours so it's those four our
_WOLtIM2dIU,495280,498100,treatments slowed down so they're
_WOLtIM2dIU,498100,500740,getting their hemodialysis three times a
_WOLtIM2dIU,500740,503530,week but it's at night and it's longer
_WOLtIM2dIU,503530,506050,and it's slower it's the way we've kind
_WOLtIM2dIU,506050,508660,of set up the unit says we have hospital
_WOLtIM2dIU,508660,511120,beds so you can bring your blankets you
_WOLtIM2dIU,511120,512979,can bring your sheets you can kind of
_WOLtIM2dIU,512979,514270,make it as comfortable as you can
_WOLtIM2dIU,514270,516640,because about 10 o'clock at night we're
_WOLtIM2dIU,516640,519520,gonna turn the lights down low so unless
_WOLtIM2dIU,519520,522010,the Machine alarms you hopefully can
_WOLtIM2dIU,522010,523419,just sleep straight through the night
_WOLtIM2dIU,523419,525610,get up in the morning and go to work
_WOLtIM2dIU,525610,529800,and get your sleep while you're dialyze
_WOLtIM2dIU,533790,538519,when I first started home hemodialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,538790,544529,it was great I loved it it was it was
_WOLtIM2dIU,544529,546810,just wonderful to be at home it was very
_WOLtIM2dIU,546810,549779,comfortable very pleasant in my own
_WOLtIM2dIU,549779,554670,environment stage is about yea high it
_WOLtIM2dIU,554670,561149,can sit on your end table and you can
_WOLtIM2dIU,561149,565199,use bags where all you have to do is run
_WOLtIM2dIU,565199,570149,a line a drain line that they give you
_WOLtIM2dIU,570149,573329,and then you can get a box of them and
_WOLtIM2dIU,573329,575339,then give you these drain lines you hook
_WOLtIM2dIU,575339,578089,it up and you run it to your bathroom
_WOLtIM2dIU,578089,583610,and you can dialyze it's color-coded
_WOLtIM2dIU,583610,592550,it's it's so easy and so comfortable
_WOLtIM2dIU,592550,596579,because again you're in your home you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,596579,597899,in your own environment
_WOLtIM2dIU,597899,602430,you're in a comfortable place I dialyze
_WOLtIM2dIU,602430,607260,in my bedroom so I'm laying in bed I'm
_WOLtIM2dIU,607260,610350,watching TV if I want to eat I can eat I
_WOLtIM2dIU,610350,612510,want to talk on the phone I can talk on
_WOLtIM2dIU,612510,614370,the phone if I want to use my computer I
_WOLtIM2dIU,614370,617550,can do that off I just want to batch out
_WOLtIM2dIU,617550,620089,and watch a movie I can do that i
_WOLtIM2dIU,620089,625940,dialyze five times a week
_WOLtIM2dIU,625940,629690,there's no heat peaks and valleys it's
_WOLtIM2dIU,629690,634220,just very smooth I dialyzed with two and
_WOLtIM2dIU,634220,638390,a half hours each treatment so it's very
_WOLtIM2dIU,638390,642760,easy very gentle and when you get off
_WOLtIM2dIU,642760,645680,you can go do what you need to do
_WOLtIM2dIU,645680,649340,you're not drained so I like the
_WOLtIM2dIU,649340,653300,convenience I like the comfort of my own
_WOLtIM2dIU,653300,657500,home and I like the flexibility it gives
_WOLtIM2dIU,657500,661160,you and I like the feeling that it gives
_WOLtIM2dIU,661160,667990,you it gives you normalcy
_WOLtIM2dIU,671540,674240,the key to getting hemodialysis is
_WOLtIM2dIU,674240,676820,access to the circulation it would be
_WOLtIM2dIU,676820,679820,wonderful if we had an ideal access one
_WOLtIM2dIU,679820,682040,that could be placed right away that
_WOLtIM2dIU,682040,684170,could be accessed repeatedly and
_WOLtIM2dIU,684170,686300,consistently that would provide us
_WOLtIM2dIU,686300,689240,adequate blood flows for each dialysis
_WOLtIM2dIU,689240,691730,every time and that had minimal
_WOLtIM2dIU,691730,694130,complications and could be paving for a
_WOLtIM2dIU,694130,696440,long period of life because an access
_WOLtIM2dIU,696440,699529,after all is your lifeline at this point
_WOLtIM2dIU,699529,702949,we don't have an optimal access the one
_WOLtIM2dIU,702949,705560,thing that we do know as of today is
_WOLtIM2dIU,705560,708459,that for most people if you are doing
_WOLtIM2dIU,708459,711709,hemodialysis an arteriovenous fistula is
_WOLtIM2dIU,711709,714709,the best choice so an arteriovenous
_WOLtIM2dIU,714709,717769,fistula is created by connecting your
_WOLtIM2dIU,717769,720230,own artery to your own wing so it's
_WOLtIM2dIU,720230,722570,native there's absolutely no foreign
_WOLtIM2dIU,722570,725660,material in there once it's mature it
_WOLtIM2dIU,725660,728570,can be used successfully for a very long
_WOLtIM2dIU,728570,731449,period of time however the difficulty is
_WOLtIM2dIU,731449,734000,that it does take three to six months
_WOLtIM2dIU,734000,736579,for it to mature before it can be used
_WOLtIM2dIU,736579,739760,for hemodialysis an arteriovenous graft
_WOLtIM2dIU,739760,742519,is intermediate between a fistula
_WOLtIM2dIU,742519,745279,and a catheter when your veins are not
_WOLtIM2dIU,745279,747310,good enough for an arteriovenous fistula
_WOLtIM2dIU,747310,750350,the graft which is a piece of plastic is
_WOLtIM2dIU,750350,753110,used to make that connection the
_WOLtIM2dIU,753110,755360,advantage is that it can be used within
_WOLtIM2dIU,755360,757519,two to three weeks for some of the older
_WOLtIM2dIU,757519,759800,grafts but the new grafts that we have
_WOLtIM2dIU,759800,762860,nowadays can be used within 24 hours of
_WOLtIM2dIU,762860,766130,placement however because the graft is
_WOLtIM2dIU,766130,769040,still a foreign piece of material right
_WOLtIM2dIU,769040,771380,where the graft connects to the artery
_WOLtIM2dIU,771380,773329,as well as where it connects to the vein
_WOLtIM2dIU,773329,776389,it forms a narrowing that causes the
_WOLtIM2dIU,776389,779750,grafts to clot repeatedly a central
_WOLtIM2dIU,779750,781910,venous catheter is almost like a large
_WOLtIM2dIU,781910,785360,IV that's placed in your neck or in your
_WOLtIM2dIU,785360,787970,chest and the advantages of a central
_WOLtIM2dIU,787970,790819,venous catheter is that you can use it
_WOLtIM2dIU,790819,793720,immediately as soon as you place it and
_WOLtIM2dIU,793720,796550,one intention that the central venous
_WOLtIM2dIU,796550,799310,catheter was developed for was to serve
_WOLtIM2dIU,799310,802040,as a bridge until a more permanent
_WOLtIM2dIU,802040,803430,access like in our
_WOLtIM2dIU,803430,806520,Venus crafts or an arteriovenous fistula
_WOLtIM2dIU,806520,810350,or even a PD catheter is ready for use
_WOLtIM2dIU,810350,813480,however there are lots of disadvantages
_WOLtIM2dIU,813480,816089,most people find having a tube in your
_WOLtIM2dIU,816089,819270,chest very uncomfortable you cannot take
_WOLtIM2dIU,819270,821370,a shower throughout the time that you're
_WOLtIM2dIU,821370,824730,having a central venous catheter and in
_WOLtIM2dIU,824730,827010,the long run a central venous catheter
_WOLtIM2dIU,827010,829890,is prone to many complications it can
_WOLtIM2dIU,829890,832620,cause infections and because the tip of
_WOLtIM2dIU,832620,835080,the catheter sits in the heart the
_WOLtIM2dIU,835080,836640,infections can spread throughout the
_WOLtIM2dIU,836640,839000,body and lead to very serious
_WOLtIM2dIU,839000,841980,complications and in some cases even
_WOLtIM2dIU,841980,845580,death another long-term problem of a
_WOLtIM2dIU,845580,848010,central venous catheter is that because
_WOLtIM2dIU,848010,850620,it's a foreign body that sits in a large
_WOLtIM2dIU,850620,854220,vein over time the vein reacts to this
_WOLtIM2dIU,854220,856800,foreign body by causing scarring and
_WOLtIM2dIU,856800,859529,narrowing around the catheter that can
_WOLtIM2dIU,859529,861540,lead to what we call central venous
_WOLtIM2dIU,861540,866220,stenosis and this stenosis can serve as
_WOLtIM2dIU,866220,869339,a deterrent for us to be able to put any
_WOLtIM2dIU,869339,872700,further permanent access in that side or
_WOLtIM2dIU,872700,876480,that extremity I had a catheter when I
_WOLtIM2dIU,876480,882180,first started have ever since what I can
_WOLtIM2dIU,882180,885029,tell you about the catheter is I didn't
_WOLtIM2dIU,885029,889790,like it it's bad it's not a good way to
_WOLtIM2dIU,889790,894240,dialyze I know a lot of patients like
_WOLtIM2dIU,894240,896730,the ease of it they're not getting stuck
_WOLtIM2dIU,896730,899190,and you can just hook it up and go and
_WOLtIM2dIU,899190,900270,that's easy
_WOLtIM2dIU,900270,902790,but it's really not a good way to
_WOLtIM2dIU,902790,906959,dialyze I didn't like them putting it in
_WOLtIM2dIU,906959,910130,and I didn't like him pulling it out
_WOLtIM2dIU,910130,914160,there's nothing about a catheter that I
_WOLtIM2dIU,914160,920930,like it was a necessity other than that
_WOLtIM2dIU,920930,926399,for me it was not good it was I don't
_WOLtIM2dIU,926399,929600,like anything about it
_WOLtIM2dIU,932650,938350,my advice for the patients is first be
_WOLtIM2dIU,938350,941590,to cap mother ship this your body is
_WOLtIM2dIU,941590,945790,your treatment be to captain the doctors
_WOLtIM2dIU,945790,951280,the nurses they're there to help you to
_WOLtIM2dIU,951280,954250,give you information but you are the
_WOLtIM2dIU,954250,957790,final decision-maker and in order to
_WOLtIM2dIU,957790,959590,make a good decision you need to learn
_WOLtIM2dIU,959590,962860,as much as you can about the modality
_WOLtIM2dIU,962860,971880,that you choose and don't be afraid to
_WOLtIM2dIU,971880,975180,ask questions
_WOLtIM2dIU,975270,981700,demand answers get alternatives and then
_WOLtIM2dIU,981700,985480,make your decision and that's what
_WOLtIM2dIU,985480,989260,anything in life it is your life using
_WOLtIM2dIU,989260,992200,one who has to go through this so you
_WOLtIM2dIU,992200,993700,need to learn as much as you can about
_WOLtIM2dIU,993700,994410,it
_WOLtIM2dIU,994410,999870,own it take control of it
_WOLtIM2dIU,999870,1003470,and make it work for you I guess looking
_WOLtIM2dIU,1003470,1006110,back on one of the things I can say is
_WOLtIM2dIU,1006110,1010730,that one of the reason home worked out
_WOLtIM2dIU,1010730,1012590,and whatever he's an incentive worked
_WOLtIM2dIU,1012590,1014450,out was because I made it work out
_WOLtIM2dIU,1014450,1018580,I took hold of it and I made it my own
_WOLtIM2dIU,1018580,1023030,and I make it work for me and that's
_WOLtIM2dIU,1023030,1024800,what I would advise anybody do is
_WOLtIM2dIU,1024800,1026959,whatever mode LLC you choose you make it
_WOLtIM2dIU,1026959,1028880,work for you and if it don't you change
_WOLtIM2dIU,1028880,1032300,it so now that you know about different
