XOosEKi45Ls,119084,120353,Blech!
XOosEKi45Ls,120586,122855,"Well, I'm sure it's an acquired taste."
XOosEKi45Ls,124190,125391,[sighing]
XOosEKi45Ls,125524,127193,"I don't know how you do it Gare Bear,"
XOosEKi45Ls,127326,130864,but that's the best cup of French toast I've ever had!
XOosEKi45Ls,131364,132732,[meowing]
XOosEKi45Ls,132865,135801,"Well, you two astronauts going to eat marshmallows."
XOosEKi45Ls,135935,139505,I'm gonna have a can of Swedish Barnacle Balls.
XOosEKi45Ls,139638,141574,As soon as I can get my can opener.
XOosEKi45Ls,141708,143008,"But Squidward,"
XOosEKi45Ls,143142,144844,didn't you take a can opener when you hiked out here?
XOosEKi45Ls,144978,147980,Why would I bother? We're ten feet from my house.
XOosEKi45Ls,148113,149616,But this is the wilderness.
XOosEKi45Ls,149749,152685,It just doesn't seem to fit the camping spirit.
XOosEKi45Ls,152952,154853,Pretty weenie.
XOosEKi45Ls,154987,156121,"Alright, alright."
XOosEKi45Ls,156255,158458,Gimme a marshmallow.
XOosEKi45Ls,162295,164164,Ah! Ahh!

XOosEKi45Ls,189288,190957,[meowing]
XOosEKi45Ls,198598,201133,"Wow, it's Sunday, Gary!"

XOosEKi45Ls,207073,208875,A sundae!
XOosEKi45Ls,210042,211210,Whoops.
XOosEKi45Ls,211344,212611,Looks like we're out of ice cream.
XOosEKi45Ls,212745,214980,I guess I'll have to use something else.
XOosEKi45Ls,215681,216849,Katsup!
XOosEKi45Ls,223155,224289,Hmm.

XOosEKi45Ls,251050,251783,[burping]
XOosEKi45Ls,251917,253119,Hmm.
XOosEKi45Ls,253252,256489,Wait. I know one other place we can find peanuts.
XOosEKi45Ls,258157,260293,Good thing I still have these peanut plants
XOosEKi45Ls,260426,262262,growing in the window sill.
XOosEKi45Ls,263228,265531,A little texture never hurt.
XOosEKi45Ls,265831,266531,There we go.
XOosEKi45Ls,267066,269068,This sundae's gonna taste great!
XOosEKi45Ls,269201,271037,"Aren't you gonna help me, Gary?"

XOosEKi45Ls,317416,319651,Mr. Krabs was right.
XOosEKi45Ls,319785,322121,What am I gonna do with all these?
XOosEKi45Ls,322254,323422,[laughing]
XOosEKi45Ls,323556,325558,"Hey, is that one purple?"
XOosEKi45Ls,325691,328594,Purple is my favorite color.
XOosEKi45Ls,330629,332565,This isn't half bad.
XOosEKi45Ls,332698,336802,"Hey, world! Pretty Patties is the best idea ever!"
XOosEKi45Ls,336936,339505,"If that imposter wants a Krabby Patty,"

XOosEKi45Ls,347480,349181,"Join me, boy, or you're fired."
XOosEKi45Ls,349314,350949,It doesn't seem right.
XOosEKi45Ls,351450,353719,But it feels so good!
XOosEKi45Ls,353853,357122,"Seahorseradish, the gnarliest stuff in the ocean."
XOosEKi45Ls,357256,361360,Ooh. Hold on. I've got a jar toenail clippings in my office.
XOosEKi45Ls,361493,363829,Oops. I dropped it in the toilet!
XOosEKi45Ls,363962,367266,"Well, fish it out and I'll dry it with me gym socks."
XOosEKi45Ls,367399,369100,[moaning]
XOosEKi45Ls,369234,375374,"Why, that's the most diabolical Krabby Patty ever spawned."
XOosEKi45Ls,375508,379078,I call it... the Nasty Patty.
XOosEKi45Ls,379211,381881,[laughing]
XOosEKi45Ls,382414,383983,Oh!
XOosEKi45Ls,384116,385850,Ooh! Fortune cookies!

XOosEKi45Ls,388921,391223,"These cookies can see the future, Gary."
XOosEKi45Ls,391357,395160,Which means they knew we were hungry even before we did.
XOosEKi45Ls,395728,397129,Let's eat!
XOosEKi45Ls,397263,398631,Mmm.

XOosEKi45Ls,423789,424823,gonna sing for me while I eat?
XOosEKi45Ls,424957,426459,I don't have children!
XOosEKi45Ls,426592,429595,"I mean, I mean, yah, yah, outside, please."

XOosEKi45Ls,454353,457222,"You're not using that tan accelerator again, are you?"
XOosEKi45Ls,457356,460759,Oh. Don't pretend you don't love it.
XOosEKi45Ls,463228,464764,[sighing]
XOosEKi45Ls,466565,468567,"Good work, man."
XOosEKi45Ls,468700,470469,It's just a little old Krabby Patty
XOosEKi45Ls,470603,472538,smothered in jellyfish jelly.

XOosEKi45Ls,699898,701299,Not the way I use ‘em.
XOosEKi45Ls,701433,703300,Yet they sell millions of bags a day.
XOosEKi45Ls,703435,705771,"Well, maybe if they didn't stretch the truth,"
XOosEKi45Ls,705904,707972,they wouldn't sell as many.
XOosEKi45Ls,708407,710342,Two sal lads.

XOosEKi45Ls,719985,721187,Here you go.
XOosEKi45Ls,721320,724422,"- Two sal lads. - Ew, gross!"
XOosEKi45Ls,724556,726125,Those aren't salads.
XOosEKi45Ls,726258,729261,"Take those back. Remove the bun, the patty, and the condiments."
XOosEKi45Ls,729395,731429,But that leaves just lettuce and tomato.
XOosEKi45Ls,731563,733099,Exactly.
XOosEKi45Ls,733632,735000,Alright.
XOosEKi45Ls,735500,736634,Okay.
