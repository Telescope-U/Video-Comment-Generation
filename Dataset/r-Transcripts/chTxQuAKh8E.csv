chTxQuAKh8E,80,1760,let's talk about the science of camel
chTxQuAKh8E,1760,3520,toe now you guys know i've talked about
chTxQuAKh8E,3520,5359,the front seam and how can cause that
chTxQuAKh8E,5359,7600,uncomfortable vertical tension that just
chTxQuAKh8E,7600,9920,pulls up your crotch but does no front
chTxQuAKh8E,9920,12960,seam mean no camel toe not necessarily
chTxQuAKh8E,12960,14480,if there's too much fabric at the hips
chTxQuAKh8E,14480,15920,it probably means the bottoms are too
chTxQuAKh8E,15920,17840,big for you there will be excess fabric
chTxQuAKh8E,17840,19760,and that will outline the v now there's
chTxQuAKh8E,19760,21840,too much fabric at the crotch that
chTxQuAKh8E,21840,24480,fabric is going to creep in under and up
chTxQuAKh8E,24480,26320,causing camel toe what i'm trying to say
chTxQuAKh8E,26320,28000,is that if your fabric has good stretch
chTxQuAKh8E,28000,29760,and recovery even if you have a front
chTxQuAKh8E,29760,31519,seam but it's a good pattern that fits
chTxQuAKh8E,31519,33840,your body it'll be anti-camel toe try
chTxQuAKh8E,33840,35200,this test at home to see if your bottoms
chTxQuAKh8E,35200,36960,are fitting correctly after moving
chTxQuAKh8E,36960,38800,around naturally do a mini squat try to
chTxQuAKh8E,38800,41120,pinch out some extra fabric and stand up
chTxQuAKh8E,41120,42719,if there is still extra fabric that
chTxQuAKh8E,42719,44480,you're holding on to it's probably a bad
chTxQuAKh8E,44480,46239,fit too big for you and causing camel
chTxQuAKh8E,46239,48000,dough during the product development of
chTxQuAKh8E,48000,49760,the super sculpt short we had to fit
chTxQuAKh8E,49760,52399,test this so many times on all different
chTxQuAKh8E,52399,54399,bodies to make sure that the hip width
chTxQuAKh8E,54399,56640,as well as that inner crotch distance
chTxQuAKh8E,56640,59039,was right so that it could be anti-camel
chTxQuAKh8E,59039,61520,toe
