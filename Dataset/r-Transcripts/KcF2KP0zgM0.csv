KcF2KP0zgM0,482479,488080,to say guys i i thought we'd start off  with this game just to give you a little  bit of an idea of what we're gonna be
KcF2KP0zgM0,488080,493120,looking at here and the kind of things  that we're gonna be able to see i i'm  actually really excited to see something
KcF2KP0zgM0,493120,499120,like this because it's the same type of  like battle royale type thing that we've  seen in many other games but it's taken
KcF2KP0zgM0,499120,504160,to a completely ridiculously level and i  think it's amazing so i'm pretty excited
KcF2KP0zgM0,504160,509759,let's go to the next one  i'm definitely ready to check out the  next one but also i want to hear what

KcF2KP0zgM0,525680,531200,talk about nights of the deep uh three  of us have have had  plenty of crabs in our life we've had
KcF2KP0zgM0,531200,538000,them as pets we eat them we love them  we love just everything about fighting  and chance anything about that game
KcF2KP0zgM0,538000,544320,you know all jokes aside that game uh  that game actually looks really fun you  know it looks goofy it looks ridiculous
KcF2KP0zgM0,544320,551600,it's crabs with guns shields there's  classes there's seems like there's  serious mechanics oh yeah lined up with
KcF2KP0zgM0,551600,556640,the stupidity of it being craps but it  looks fun yeah also lobsters lobsters
KcF2KP0zgM0,556640,561920,too  crustaceans  yeah i think it's here you're so smart
KcF2KP0zgM0,561920,567920,dude  um i would have to completely agree with  you on that one chance it looks like a  lot of fun it's the kind of game that
KcF2KP0zgM0,567920,574240,you know you put up shroud on your third  monitor mutem and you start going to  pound town on this game and uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,574240,579519,i tell you what i would likely roll each  and every single one of you at that game
KcF2KP0zgM0,579519,585279,yeah wow so what do you think i don't  think that's true at all but  i will tell you what i think about the
KcF2KP0zgM0,585279,591600,game i love the creative jump on the  game they did a really good job with  their creativity and taking a jump off
KcF2KP0zgM0,591600,598160,the you know creative ledge that you  don't really see often and  i like it you know it's a pretty good
KcF2KP0zgM0,598160,604160,game which which which crab do you think  you guys are okay first you would not  beat me  yeah it would be so easy no it wouldn't
KcF2KP0zgM0,604160,609680,you actually are not that good at games  so that's just my hot take all right
KcF2KP0zgM0,609680,615600,awesome thank you so much for your  insight guys and uh back to you rich  he's such a loser thank you so much nick
KcF2KP0zgM0,615600,622000,it was great to listen to all the  handsome guys on the panel and you but  everybody if you want to check out
KcF2KP0zgM0,622000,627360,knights of the deep you can add it to  your steam wishlist right now and also  if it's a game that you think you like
KcF2KP0zgM0,627360,632720,you can do this throughout the day you  can hop in discord and you can react in  the discord to the games that you like
KcF2KP0zgM0,632720,639600,and that's actually going to help them  win the grants which asman mentioned a  little bit earlier keep that in your  mind as we jump into the next game it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,639600,645000,from neo interactive and it's called  samurai zero
KcF2KP0zgM0,645480,649589,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,654640,662480,i made a pact with myself i'll make it  to shambhala hope i'm invited my  frequencies like a gotham i made a pact
KcF2KP0zgM0,662480,668160,with myself  right i think that love is the song
KcF2KP0zgM0,668160,674040,even in the darkness of night the moon  is always shining
KcF2KP0zgM0,691690,694789,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,700839,706639,victory incredible  oh stop
KcF2KP0zgM0,709279,712560,don't do the top ropes
KcF2KP0zgM0,715600,721600,all right i love how that one looks but  i'm very excited because asmin is with  the lead producer of the game right now
KcF2KP0zgM0,721600,727760,ethos so we can find out more about  everything samurai zero
KcF2KP0zgM0,728560,734079,hey what's going on man how you doing  i'm good how are you doing i'm doing  pretty good i mean the trailer looks
KcF2KP0zgM0,734079,739120,pretty cool it's an interesting uh  interesting idea what what is this uh  what's the game about
KcF2KP0zgM0,739120,745440,sure yeah so um thanks so much for  having me so samurai zero it's a  multiplayer game multiplayer pvp focused
KcF2KP0zgM0,745440,750480,game it's a third person  we're labeling it uh technically a
KcF2KP0zgM0,750480,757040,tactical action hack and slash game but  that's too much so we just say okay  whatever we're just gonna call it a  fighting game um and so it has this
KcF2KP0zgM0,757040,762800,really cool layer where basically the  world takes place in this science  fantasy universe called edo which is
KcF2KP0zgM0,762800,768800,basically inspired by uh japanese age of  the samurai with a little mix of little  sci-fi and cyberpunk i think that yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,768800,773839,that's badass man yeah the the entire uh  uh just like the aesthetic of it is
KcF2KP0zgM0,773839,779120,great and you're talking about like  having it in 3d and i'm curious why you  decided to go because most fighting
KcF2KP0zgM0,779120,784320,games are all in 2d and what made you  want to go with 3d in this game  well
KcF2KP0zgM0,784320,790560,actually what you just said is basically  the answer uh a lot of fighting games  are in 2d so we wanted to mix it up and  try something a little bit different so
KcF2KP0zgM0,790560,796160,we created a 3d game and a lot of the  like advanced mechanics that the game  has whether it's like the advanced
KcF2KP0zgM0,796160,802880,movement where you can like wall run and  you can dash  and whether you're doing the combat  which is all precision focused uh i
KcF2KP0zgM0,802880,808160,think our game's pretty unique in the  fact that we actually don't have a lot  of aim assist in the game and a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,808160,813600,targeting systems a lot of it's very  precision based so it's a lot of like  actually landing your hits and we do
KcF2KP0zgM0,813600,818800,this thanks uh to using the pc as our  main platform we actually have a lot of  control with your camera and where your
KcF2KP0zgM0,818800,824160,character aims using the mouse so  creates a really unique different take  for uh fighting games i think yeah if
KcF2KP0zgM0,824160,831120,that's the case i think some people  could even almost use it as a name  trainer but the way you describe it yeah  that's really cool and uh i i think that
KcF2KP0zgM0,831120,837120,fighting games one of the most important  things about them is kind of how they  feel to play and when will people be
KcF2KP0zgM0,837120,843760,able to really get an opportunity to  actually feel how samurai zero plays  sure yeah so uh right now what we have
KcF2KP0zgM0,843760,850880,is la or actually i should say last year  around this time we had a play test  already so people were able to get a  little bit of taste of 1v1 with one of
KcF2KP0zgM0,850880,857040,our characters ryder which is the robot  you saw on the trailer he's a robot  samurai so it's pretty cool uh and the  news character luna which we showed in
KcF2KP0zgM0,857040,862480,this trailer as well as a brand new map  which was tower and a bunch of brand new  mechanics and and features that we
KcF2KP0zgM0,862480,868560,brought to the game within that time uh  we'll be showing to our patreon people  later uh uh next early next month and
KcF2KP0zgM0,868560,874160,then also later this year we're gonna be  doing a full public play test where  players will be able to get their hands  on and try it themselves that sounds
KcF2KP0zgM0,874160,880320,awesome man yeah i've i haven't really  played a fighting game like this pretty  much ever before so i'm really excited
KcF2KP0zgM0,880320,885760,to see where this game goes and uh  thanks a lot for coming on and uh really  look forward to see where the game goes
KcF2KP0zgM0,885760,891120,oh no thank you thanks for the  opportunity appreciate it absolutely and  if any of you guys want to add samurai
KcF2KP0zgM0,891120,896560,zero to your steamlicious you can go  ahead and do that now but we're gonna be  on to the next game yeah let's hop right

KcF2KP0zgM0,1262880,1268960,unique game that you don't really see  often i love the dubstep that they  played i thought that was honestly
KcF2KP0zgM0,1268960,1275440,amazing it the game reminds me of  somebody who doodled that in like sixth  grade and then all of a sudden this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,1275440,1282400,became a reality it became a reality  yeah like after they got watching a  little bit too much invader zim and they  just get too crazy too i'm edgy kid with
KcF2KP0zgM0,1282400,1289840,a notebook in a dream yep and now it's a  game i think it's awesome and the other  game that i really want to talk about a  lot is neodash like
KcF2KP0zgM0,1289840,1296080,that is so so cool that's true the  reason why i like it it's like you watch  the game and it's like hypnotic there
KcF2KP0zgM0,1296080,1303440,were like games in gamecube that were  like this reminded me of like the old  school essence of like f-zero or  something and i think it's just such a
KcF2KP0zgM0,1303440,1309679,cool looking visually appealing game  yeah it reminds me a lot of uh  uh what does it remind me of it reminds
KcF2KP0zgM0,1309679,1315039,me of those like old school gamecube  games that i used to really enjoy and  this is the kind of game i feel like
KcF2KP0zgM0,1315039,1320640,where i could just get lost for a few  hours sit there and just drive around  the track super colorful and just enjoy
KcF2KP0zgM0,1320640,1326480,the music it's very nice it's what i  like about it is it it strikes me as one  of those games where you can play it
KcF2KP0zgM0,1326480,1332240,very very casually you can just kind of  like zen out on your couch or something  but also if you want to go really hard
KcF2KP0zgM0,1332240,1338400,on it i'm sure there's going to be some  crazy tracks to uh challenge yourself on  it what's your uh what's your favorite  game you've seen so far
KcF2KP0zgM0,1338400,1344080,honestly  probably the lobster one you know what i  feel like with the lobsters when it  comes to that you know what you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,1344080,1351600,what must have happened but you know  what they got i perfectly i framed  through every single attack that that  boss did like let's be honest i did i
KcF2KP0zgM0,1351600,1359280,avoided every single thing perfectly  what the [ __ ]  no no no is this the block why why
KcF2KP0zgM0,1359280,1366000,what is this what no it's listen guys  wait did i just hear a second lobster
KcF2KP0zgM0,1366000,1371200,what is going on is this still your  favorite game i hate this it's not is  this the lobster game
KcF2KP0zgM0,1371200,1374880,no it's not they don't have guns
KcF2KP0zgM0,1377600,1383360,this guy's got a sniper rifle in his  mouth  i can't believe it
KcF2KP0zgM0,1384799,1390480,okay so i could see where the  inspiration came jesus christ so is this  wow okay
KcF2KP0zgM0,1390480,1398480,yeah  it's really real funny guys right uh-huh  who's yeah it's real funny
KcF2KP0zgM0,1398640,1403919,on youtube  somebody's getting banned after this  yeah this game is uh honestly i
KcF2KP0zgM0,1403919,1410159,absolutely love this game i think it is  very funny and unique uh i think it is i  love when developers always try to make
KcF2KP0zgM0,1410159,1416720,things fun and interesting their trailer  was fun i liked a little the the trumpet  at the end was great uh i thought that
KcF2KP0zgM0,1416720,1421919,was you know what i think happened man  you always see those lobsters that like  the seafood restaurants where are they
KcF2KP0zgM0,1421919,1427039,where do they put the lobsters asthma  where do they put the lobsters uh well  don't they go in the ocean no they have
KcF2KP0zgM0,1427039,1432960,them in crane machines wait what  you've never been you're telling me
KcF2KP0zgM0,1432960,1439279,you've never been to a seafood  restaurant i've never been so they have  lobsters  under water
KcF2KP0zgM0,1439279,1446559,yes and then you put them in the box  no if you win the lobster at the seafood  restaurant you eat it
KcF2KP0zgM0,1446880,1454000,now now imagine now imagine the life of  that kind of crustacean who's been  submerged in a little toy box oh my
KcF2KP0zgM0,1454000,1459360,brain poking at him every day that's who  i think is in this game i think they  they took them right from the crane game
KcF2KP0zgM0,1459360,1464880,imagine that so they get taken from the  crane game they get put in this and  that's why they want to fight i feel
KcF2KP0zgM0,1464880,1470640,like that's the kind of game that's like  it's going to be a really good stream  game because of how absolutely
KcF2KP0zgM0,1470640,1477200,ridiculous it is yeah it's just crazy  off the wall you got a lobster with a  flamethrower you got a lobster with a
KcF2KP0zgM0,1477200,1483760,sniper rifle a crab with a gun yep and  you know what that game reminds me a lot  of  crabs fighting crabs reminds me a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,1483760,1487840,when rich did a subathon in my closet
KcF2KP0zgM0,1490080,1497700,um  yeah i i  [Laughter]

KcF2KP0zgM0,1752159,1759960,that we've taken a look at today it's  from stroll art studios and it's called  below the stone

KcF2KP0zgM0,1838240,1843440,yep rocks and below the stone is one of  those games where i know asmin pretty
KcF2KP0zgM0,1843440,1849120,well this is the type of art style that  i think really resonates with us any  time that you get to see a game with
KcF2KP0zgM0,1849120,1855520,that pixel art kind of brings you back  you start to remember some of the  memories so for below the stone you can
KcF2KP0zgM0,1855520,1862880,actually already add it to your steam  wish list but when we're talking about  that art style i know i want to learn a  little bit more luckily asman is going
KcF2KP0zgM0,1862880,1868960,to be talking to the lead artist mike  stahl art right now  thanks rich yeah i mean you're
KcF2KP0zgM0,1868960,1874000,definitely right i see that art style  and i go right back to 1998 running
KcF2KP0zgM0,1874000,1879279,through like legend of zelda link to the  past or something like that i absolutely
KcF2KP0zgM0,1879279,1885120,love it and thank you so much mike for  coming on and sharing your game with us  and my understanding is you guys had a
KcF2KP0zgM0,1885120,1890880,really interesting journey be coming and  uh coming to the expo today and uh  what's the game development uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,1890880,1897600,journey been like for you  it's hard to wrap it up in uh you know a  small little segment right it's it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,1897600,1903600,like um  uh you know we started um  you know myself uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,1903600,1910799,i i didn't go to college or anything for  this um i was kind of just going into it  as raw as possible right i like it
KcF2KP0zgM0,1910799,1916240,it you know i um  started by um kind of inviting i started
KcF2KP0zgM0,1916240,1923279,with just my art right  and invited a couple people um to join  me um andrew being one of them uh our
KcF2KP0zgM0,1923279,1928880,lead programmer and he um you know we  worked on below the stone for a while uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,1928880,1935279,we needed a composer for a kickstarter  later on um so we ended up picking up a  composer karim
KcF2KP0zgM0,1935279,1941600,um  and you know we actually failed our  first kickstarter um
KcF2KP0zgM0,1941600,1948320,and what i learned yeah what i learned  though right is just putting yourself  out there like is a huge win right it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,1948320,1953919,not about like the money in kicks it's  it's really about like people who are  fans of
KcF2KP0zgM0,1953919,1960960,that make your game a success right and  we ended up gaining like hundreds of new  fans from this kickstarter um and
KcF2KP0zgM0,1960960,1966159,eventually publishers even started  contacting us um in fact uh kind of a
KcF2KP0zgM0,1966159,1972399,funny story with our publisher um  you know our relationship uh i started  by blocking them um
KcF2KP0zgM0,1972399,1977440,i don't know if i should share that but  uh yeah i uh very smart move by me but
KcF2KP0zgM0,1977440,1982880,um you know i started by um you know  originally um  you know they contacted me i
KcF2KP0zgM0,1982880,1988960,accidentally like you know i didn't know  who they were i blocked them then uh  they contacted me again blocked them  again and then i was like
KcF2KP0zgM0,1988960,1995039,and then they found my facebook out of  nowhere right oh my god i was like  yeah i was like whoa
KcF2KP0zgM0,1995039,2001519,facebook all right  maybe they have something to say so then  um you know i realized these guys were
KcF2KP0zgM0,2001519,2007279,serious about our game and they saw what  we were trying to make  was as important as how we thought about
KcF2KP0zgM0,2007279,2012480,it as right  um  and  then we realized like you know this is a
KcF2KP0zgM0,2012480,2018640,kind of like a perfect fit for us um  and you know it really kind of huge you
KcF2KP0zgM0,2018640,2024320,know this  yeah every every step of the way it's  just been kind of like a twist and a  turn
KcF2KP0zgM0,2024320,2029519,you know hundreds of different  directions for this game well i bet that  must have been pretty uh reassuring
KcF2KP0zgM0,2029519,2034880,whenever you have publishers reaching  out to you like that and being so  insistent about it going and doing
KcF2KP0zgM0,2034880,2041840,whatever they need to do to talk to you  yeah i mean like seriously i um  you know and these guys are great too
KcF2KP0zgM0,2041840,2047120,like  everybody you know i used to not like  publishers at first but then i realized
KcF2KP0zgM0,2047120,2052398,like these guys are real you know these  guys are real people you know and then  you know it it worked out
KcF2KP0zgM0,2052398,2059358,yeah i i bet it seems like it has  obviously it has so like yeah you're  talking about like this game it's like a
KcF2KP0zgM0,2059358,2065520,it's got like the pixel art a little bit  to it but it's also got a roguelike  element how does this game play
KcF2KP0zgM0,2065520,2072560,so  uh where we where we kind of separate  ourselves from other roguelikes is we  actually make it so like crafting and
KcF2KP0zgM0,2072560,2078398,equipping gear is actually like  important to your character there's  actually like a long-term progression  whereas other roguelikes what they do is
KcF2KP0zgM0,2078398,2084240,kind of like you go down until it's  almost like a diablo-esque where like  you go down you die and then you start
KcF2KP0zgM0,2084240,2091679,over then you go down die and start over  go down die and start and like that's  like super repetitive and roguelike so  the way we do it is we make it so every
KcF2KP0zgM0,2091679,2099040,time you descend you can actually like  um bring resources back with you to this  kingdom area and you can actually like
KcF2KP0zgM0,2099040,2104400,use that gear to progress further in the  game you can wear this stuff but every  time you go down right it's a roguelike
KcF2KP0zgM0,2104400,2109520,so every time you go down you're risking  that stuff that you're wearing right i  guess so
KcF2KP0zgM0,2109520,2114720,yeah so it's kind of like a twist on  like how normally roguelikes do it so  every time you're going down you're
KcF2KP0zgM0,2114720,2121359,risking everything that you're bringing  down with you from all your adventures  and everything  yeah if you die you'd lose all the stuff
KcF2KP0zgM0,2121359,2129119,on your character oh my god that's  intense yeah  so you can spend like hours crafting all
KcF2KP0zgM0,2129119,2134480,this gear right yeah wearing it you  decided to take on the boss and then you  realize like oh i don't know how this
KcF2KP0zgM0,2134480,2140240,guy works and then like you start  learning the pattern you're like oh [ __ ]  i you know i don't know for a lot of  curse on stream that would have been the
KcF2KP0zgM0,2140240,2146880,first one it's okay but uh yeah but  anyway yeah you know um  so uh yeah it's like every time you go
KcF2KP0zgM0,2146880,2153040,down it's like kind of like a new  adventure we have 50 biomes we're  planning um we want to make it so like  every time you go down like it's it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,2153040,2158800,going to be like a completely new kind  of adventure every time  okay so yeah like you go down you have
KcF2KP0zgM0,2158800,2164800,no idea what's going on it kind of  almost reminds me of a game like a rust  you know like a super high stakes game
KcF2KP0zgM0,2164800,2169839,and if you get killed you lose all your  stuff and i know how crushing that is
KcF2KP0zgM0,2169839,2175599,but it's also like really really intense  i think back like things like games i  played on that like two years ago i
KcF2KP0zgM0,2175599,2182079,still remember them so i'm i'm really  excited and uh if people want to enjoy  their pro your project excuse me and
KcF2KP0zgM0,2182079,2187200,they want to support it uh where can  they go  well they can go to belowthestone.com um
KcF2KP0zgM0,2187200,2193680,we got a discord i'm going to be sitting  in the voice channel after this um you  know this and um if you want to you know

KcF2KP0zgM0,2217440,2223680,especially with a uh graphic style that  i and i think a lot of other people kind  of around our age resonate with really

KcF2KP0zgM0,2257839,2263760,overworld forget progression sometimes  but actually seeing taking a risk trying  to push a little bit further i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,2263760,2269520,definitely looking forward to checking  that game out but we have one more game  left in the category it's from bedtime
KcF2KP0zgM0,2269520,2275320,digital games let's take a look at  figment 2 creed valley
KcF2KP0zgM0,2275850,2295040,[Music]

KcF2KP0zgM0,2301600,2312320,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,2312320,2322040,enough  [Applause]  [Music]

KcF2KP0zgM0,2336960,2342240,you can add that to your steam wish list  right now but let's talk about all the  games that we actually saw in this
KcF2KP0zgM0,2342240,2349200,category i'm gonna throw it up to the  second best gamer in otk nmp lol
KcF2KP0zgM0,2352720,2358079,uh okay rich excuse me uh if i'm not the  first best and who's the first best
KcF2KP0zgM0,2358079,2363119,sorry we're getting distracted here  clearly i'm the best gamer um we just  saw a whole bunch of awesome adventure
KcF2KP0zgM0,2363119,2368960,games ardo bio gun below the stone uh  figment two um i love them all chance
KcF2KP0zgM0,2368960,2376000,what was your uh what was your favorite  that's not how we're supposed to do it  we can okay well out of all of those
KcF2KP0zgM0,2376000,2382400,it's i was gonna say ardo was my  favorite initially perfect  i like the the hack and slash the colors
KcF2KP0zgM0,2382400,2387520,being splashed around as you're kind of  running through you can see that it's  like it's white and bland but as your
KcF2KP0zgM0,2387520,2394800,character moves on it kind of unloads  all those beautiful colors but not also  the the combat looks fluid it looks good
KcF2KP0zgM0,2394800,2400560,it looks like a really solid hack and  slash along with just looking gorgeous  but i'm a little torn because you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,2400560,2406800,after hearing the dev with below the  stone that looks really good you know i  like gear  gear is so satisfying to receive i don't
KcF2KP0zgM0,2406800,2412240,know  maybe ardo has it too but i'm torn you  know i'm all the games look really good
KcF2KP0zgM0,2412240,2417760,but i had to pick a go with her sir  how'd you feel about ardo so ardo is  absolutely beautiful i love that it's

KcF2KP0zgM0,2430560,2435839,good riveting soundtrack hey yo why as  chance said below the stone you know you
KcF2KP0zgM0,2435839,2442240,can craft your own gear after hearing  the dev it's like a survival hardcore  rogue like you don't even know what he  was talking about
KcF2KP0zgM0,2442240,2448480,i don't think i know what he was you're  chatting you know i i respect it though  i'm more of a like creed valley type of
KcF2KP0zgM0,2448480,2454720,guy yeah the soundtrack it sounds like a  bad bedtime story that you never want to  end you know really
KcF2KP0zgM0,2454720,2461920,[ __ ] so creed valley figment too that  was that was your favorite one i say  it's my favorite because the soundtrack  like they the soundtrack makes you
KcF2KP0zgM0,2461920,2468319,glue your eyes on the screen like it  makes you want to pay attention to  what's going to happen next so yeah it  was it was cute it was adorable you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,2468319,2474319,figment had some really so we're talking  about figment right yes yeah yeah it had  some really cute music you see the  little scene where he's walking over the
KcF2KP0zgM0,2474319,2480720,piano it's very music driven crisp  animation voice acting  and i look forward to winning all of
KcF2KP0zgM0,2480720,2487040,these games as well chance yeah you  literally don't even know a lot of these  are adventure games you can't really  beat other people in it i feel like
KcF2KP0zgM0,2487040,2492319,y'all gaming time has passed everybody  at this table is like 40 plus bro no  excuse me
KcF2KP0zgM0,2492319,2498880,excuse me i am really good at video  games okay  but no one asked but my favorite game
KcF2KP0zgM0,2498880,2506079,actually so far of the four is actually  below the stone like chance and the  progression and just being able to you
KcF2KP0zgM0,2506079,2511839,know get gear craft gear um and then you  know  i just learned from the dev interview
KcF2KP0zgM0,2511839,2517119,that you know if you if you die you lose  all you lose it all and that to me is
KcF2KP0zgM0,2517119,2523119,really really really exciting  it was interesting to see his take on  the roguelike and i'll like to see how  that plays out but another game that did
KcF2KP0zgM0,2523119,2529920,stand out no one's mentioned biogun  looks good you know it's got that  metroid feel that a lot of people tend  to love yeah um and i look at some of
KcF2KP0zgM0,2529920,2535760,the boss fights which  boss fights in my opinion are the most  important part of these kind of games  and they look solid you know a little
KcF2KP0zgM0,2535760,2541440,bullet hill kind of dodging here and  there the gameplay looks fun um i get  some super meat boy vibes which is a
KcF2KP0zgM0,2541440,2548560,solid platformer um just kind of based  on the looks of it i saw the clip of the  doctor injecting the needle you know so
KcF2KP0zgM0,2548560,2554720,the theme of it is also awesome the  music is good looks like a solid game  yeah excited this game actually reminds
KcF2KP0zgM0,2554720,2562079,me of uh an old old old-school game like  uh mega man like backwards y'all was old  oh oh yep never mind yeah i think he's
KcF2KP0zgM0,2562079,2567200,43 or he just proved my point how do you  feel about biogun there huh i like it it
KcF2KP0zgM0,2567200,2572800,reminds me of a computer lab game i used  to play in fifth grade so about 45 years  ago no
KcF2KP0zgM0,2572800,2579680,yesterday i don't want to do quick math  that's kind of embarrassing yeah  hey  nick which game here is more likely to

KcF2KP0zgM0,2619440,2625599,we just got to watch a little peek from  one of our sponsors about eating brains  but now we have a whole game category
KcF2KP0zgM0,2625599,2633270,for the glowy brains it's one of my  favorite types of games it's none other  than strategy
KcF2KP0zgM0,2633270,2639839,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,2639839,2645599,uh when we're actually looking at these  strategy games we have a huge list of  very different types of games so i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,2645599,2650640,excited to just peel through this  category the first one is unlike  anything i've really ever seen before
KcF2KP0zgM0,2650640,2656319,asm and i have spent a lot of time  talking about this one it's from tukana  interactive and it's called dwarf
KcF2KP0zgM0,2656319,2659319,romantic
KcF2KP0zgM0,2668560,2728239,so  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,2733359,2739359,that that one looks really relaxing to  play i'm very excited to actually check  it out the first time that we watched
KcF2KP0zgM0,2739359,2746400,that trailer with asman he actually  turned to me anyway wow dude look at  that tree dude wow
KcF2KP0zgM0,2746400,2751440,it was cool it was a cool game and what  can i say and you guys you can play it
KcF2KP0zgM0,2751440,2758240,right now it's already available on  steam so you can go ahead and download  it but we got a little bit more to look
KcF2KP0zgM0,2758240,2767640,at inside of the strategy category this  one's coming from sunspear games and  it's called immortal gates of pyre
KcF2KP0zgM0,2775220,2778660,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,2803599,2809839,right slows down and this is an awful  fight for santa  he's gonna get back into the protection  but i'm not sure that's gonna be enough
KcF2KP0zgM0,2809839,2815280,spend his money on a citadel this could  be a really good opportunity  all four strikes coming down through the
KcF2KP0zgM0,2815280,2821440,whole army it's all bone stuck because  now they're all dead one more in the  main and there's no alloy coming in  because there's pizza party in the back
KcF2KP0zgM0,2821440,2827599,of the basement  nothing at all  the safari we're just gonna take it out
KcF2KP0zgM0,2827599,2831000,oh my god
KcF2KP0zgM0,2842400,2848160,getting to take a look at an rts game  definitely gets me very excited i don't  think i'd be standing in this arena
KcF2KP0zgM0,2848160,2854720,right now if it wasn't for the rts genre  and everything that it did do for  esports so getting to look at a game
KcF2KP0zgM0,2854720,2859760,following in that legacy  very very inspiring but we also get to
KcF2KP0zgM0,2859760,2865870,talk to the game director coulter and he  is with asman right now let's hear about  the rts
KcF2KP0zgM0,2865870,2872400,[Music]  hey what's going on colter how you doing  i'm doing great man it's good to be on
KcF2KP0zgM0,2872400,2878240,stream what's up chad it's good to have  you here i mean honestly it's been a  long time since we had an rts game come
KcF2KP0zgM0,2878240,2884319,out i mean i'm sure you remember just as  well as i do as the new commander  conquer every single every single year a
KcF2KP0zgM0,2884319,2890480,new age empires now there's not a whole  lot anymore so what inspired you to make  this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,2890480,2896240,so we started right when the big dip in  rts being released happened and it just
KcF2KP0zgM0,2896240,2901440,wow it basically came down to we  absolutely wanted to make a game you
KcF2KP0zgM0,2901440,2908640,could share with your friends right like  smashing armies with a friend seeing  stuff blow up in that big spectacle way
KcF2KP0zgM0,2908640,2914559,that's something we tried to do but  people just kept bouncing off the  difficulty curve i mean sometimes rts
KcF2KP0zgM0,2914559,2921599,are infamous for it and that's something  we set out to solve so that like you  could share with your friends or you  could have fun in this genre in a way
KcF2KP0zgM0,2921599,2927280,that you haven't been able to do before  so that's really what it was all about  and now we're seeing a renaissance there
KcF2KP0zgM0,2927280,2933280,are so many rts games in development  some of them very big titles and so we  are
KcF2KP0zgM0,2933280,2939359,working to redefine what rts means to so  many people who have felt excluded from  the genre while still delivering that
KcF2KP0zgM0,2939359,2945680,hardcore competitive experience for  people who want that  like whenever you talk about  differentiating yourself from like the
KcF2KP0zgM0,2945680,2951839,other games and like you're definitely  right like i think that what is the  starcraft you have to have 180 200 apm
KcF2KP0zgM0,2951839,2959200,or something like that now it's insane  uh it's crazy how high the skill gap  gets with these rts games so what's
KcF2KP0zgM0,2959200,2964400,different about immortal versus a lot of  these other strategy games can you get  into a little bit of that
KcF2KP0zgM0,2964400,2969680,yeah so um during that time uh early on  in our development we're really focused
KcF2KP0zgM0,2969680,2975760,on okay how can we deliver that depth  we've seen other people attempt to make  this genre more accessible and they'll
KcF2KP0zgM0,2975760,2982640,lose the magic in the process by  oversimplifying and so this was a  massive effort to really see okay can we
KcF2KP0zgM0,2982640,2988000,do this can we get the silver bullet we  haven't seen before and so this was  really a community thing we started as a
KcF2KP0zgM0,2988000,2994800,team of modders we added industry  professionals as we went along but  ultimately we we got that hardcore
KcF2KP0zgM0,2994800,3000000,delivering experience  with that much much more fun can jump  into it
KcF2KP0zgM0,3000000,3005520,you only need to know three buttons to  play immortal and have fun  we let you get to the fun with three
KcF2KP0zgM0,3005520,3012079,buttons which is just completely unlike  what's come before yeah that's  definitely a great thing i think that  especially like i mean even games like
KcF2KP0zgM0,3012079,3018000,age of empires that seem like super  simple they become incredibly complex by  how seriously the players make them and
KcF2KP0zgM0,3018000,3023119,everything like that and i guess i want  to ask so for strategy fans anybody like
KcF2KP0zgM0,3023119,3030000,that how can they support this project  so the thing that they can do is tune  into our discord we're in closed alpha
KcF2KP0zgM0,3030000,3036720,right now there are keys going out via  the streamers that we work with uh and  via our twitter so uh the discord should
KcF2KP0zgM0,3036720,3041760,be posted in the uh chat here so jump in  there check out what's going on and uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,3041760,3047520,because we're that community oriented  company we really want to get your  feedback your first impressions and if
KcF2KP0zgM0,3047520,3053200,you get a key your first experiences  well i think that makes a lot of sense  especially since you're a team of
KcF2KP0zgM0,3053200,3059920,modders and everything so you're very  used to kind of taking something and  then you know appreciating that feedback  and that iteration and so that's really
KcF2KP0zgM0,3059920,3065200,great to hear thanks a lot for coming on  culture i really appreciate it and good  luck with the game
KcF2KP0zgM0,3065200,3071520,thank you  i'm like i i'm really happy to see these  kinds of games man i am like i i it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,3071520,3076720,been a long time since we've had some  strategy games come out and it's nice to  see them yeah and there's so many
KcF2KP0zgM0,3076720,3082720,different  like kind of sub genres yeah yeah i  think that's starting to what's it's  what's starting to happen at least so
KcF2KP0zgM0,3082720,3088160,yeah guys join the discord if you want  to be a fan of immortal and uh on to the  next one yeah you talk about all the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3088160,3093599,different sub genres that are going on  inside of strategy we're going to be  taking a look right now at a tower
KcF2KP0zgM0,3093599,3100760,defense it's called spirits of the  elements and it's from hippo rider games
KcF2KP0zgM0,3101040,3104329,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3115440,3120329,so  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3122630,3128359,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3130920,3143349,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3165839,3171440,looking forward to taking more of a look  at a tower defense as well to to try to  see you know how many mobs are actually
KcF2KP0zgM0,3171440,3176559,coming out of the time how the game  actually all comes together oh i i think  that looks really cool especially the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3176559,3182400,fact that you can change the lanes like  there's not a lot of tower defense games  to let you do that unless you go to like  warcraft 3 custom games or something
KcF2KP0zgM0,3182400,3189040,like that so uh yeah i think it looks  really cool yeah it's been a little  while since we have seen a game like  that we're gonna take a deeper look soon
KcF2KP0zgM0,3189040,3196160,we're gonna get to talk about these  games but we have one more inside of  this genre and it's from tragsoft and it
KcF2KP0zgM0,3196160,3199960,is called corman
KcF2KP0zgM0,3202760,3226760,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3228870,3256389,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3259010,3270720,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3270720,3275839,coremon is now available for download on  steam so if you want to check it out you
KcF2KP0zgM0,3275839,3282000,can do just that but i want to check out  all of these games just a little bit  more and lucky for us asthma is standing
KcF2KP0zgM0,3282000,3289599,by with emiroo and techtone to talk  about everything that we saw in strategy  i mean i'll have to say i am
KcF2KP0zgM0,3289599,3296240,to be honest like i'm really excited for  immortal like i i think that game looks  really cool and as somebody who played a
KcF2KP0zgM0,3296240,3303760,lot of starcraft 2 whenever it first  came out and all rts games from like the  2000s and the 90s i am just super hyped
KcF2KP0zgM0,3303760,3309200,about it but what do you guys think amy  what do you think uh i think the game  that stands out to me most is spirits of
KcF2KP0zgM0,3309200,3314799,the elements i've always been a big fan  of td games since i was a kid playing  balloons in the computer lab and i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,3314799,3321200,that something that separates  good td games from okay ones is visuals  and sound effects and there was a lot
KcF2KP0zgM0,3321200,3327920,going on that trailer that was like  badass explosion yeah like it really  draws yeah yeah 100  section what do you think when i came
KcF2KP0zgM0,3327920,3333200,here i wanted to see innovation and  modernized version of the classics and  that's what i saw people have been
KcF2KP0zgM0,3333200,3338880,saying that gaming's been dead for years  today i feel like a little bit of life  was breathed into the whole gaming
KcF2KP0zgM0,3338880,3345440,sphere well i think that's one of the  best things about going and looking a  lot of these indie games is that people  have like these ideas and it can be
KcF2KP0zgM0,3345440,3351200,small studios you have games like  vampire survivors right one two guys  make this game it's a massive hit
KcF2KP0zgM0,3351200,3357200,everybody plays it and that's really  what we try to do with the whole event  here is we try to put a spotlight on  games that we think could be the next
KcF2KP0zgM0,3357200,3363599,one of those and uh honestly i think the  tower defense game looks really cool too  yeah i i played a little bit of balloons
KcF2KP0zgM0,3363599,3370480,before and uh i got to the expert stages  and i kept getting i got my ass beat i'm  gonna be honest and i i
KcF2KP0zgM0,3370480,3376480,i stopped playing a game i got so upset  and so i might try this one out too just  to see it like and like gameplay is
KcF2KP0zgM0,3376480,3382880,super important but like dude i'm one  year older than nmp and that dude's been  having a midlife crisis for about a  decade now it's like i'm not too worried
KcF2KP0zgM0,3382880,3389359,about the game play anymore i want to  hear good soundtracks and art style ardo  oh my god looked amazing you spell is uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,3389359,3396000,what figment 2 looked beautiful and the  soundtrack of uh what beneath the rock  yeah there's been some real good [ __ ]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3396000,3402160,yeah  i think the sound and everything like  that does really make a big difference  is that like especially like what emmy
KcF2KP0zgM0,3402160,3408880,you were talking about with like having  the graphics and like the explosions  just having them be  visually appealing like this stuff
KcF2KP0zgM0,3408880,3415280,happens it's on the screen and it just  pops off like it has to be satisfying  yeah like the the visual appeal of neo
KcF2KP0zgM0,3415280,3420480,dash too  good yeah that looks beautiful i i i  think this is really funny because like
KcF2KP0zgM0,3420480,3425680,you probably sat up here like we're  talking about like just a certain amount  of games tragedy bro you're bringing up
KcF2KP0zgM0,3425680,3430839,all the oh yeah dude i'm getting sensory  overloaded there's been so many bangers
KcF2KP0zgM0,3430839,3437359,yeah i understand that i feel the same  way man like i'm i'm very very excited  especially the as i said especially the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3437359,3443520,immortal game right like i see this and  it reminds me of like you know starcraft  2 it gives me that same vibe and i am
KcF2KP0zgM0,3443520,3448880,just so excited to see that especially  like i'm really curious to know like  what do they mean about like making it
KcF2KP0zgM0,3448880,3454319,easier to do right like what's the micro  in this game how do you have to play it  like what's it really about and that's
KcF2KP0zgM0,3454319,3460720,what i'm really curious about as well  yeah with the tower defense too like i  have no idea how they're gonna do what  is that open lane tower defense yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,3460720,3465920,i've never seen that ever i have no idea  yeah i i haven't played hardly any tower
KcF2KP0zgM0,3465920,3472480,defense games at all but um i've done  like i guess a little bit of the  warcraft uh three ones and then also the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3472480,3479040,balloons and as i said every single time  i do it i just try to make a bunch of  the most powerful units and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,3479040,3485040,whenever that stops working i usually  rage quit the game so i'm curious to see  how far i'll go we have to try new
KcF2KP0zgM0,3485040,3490799,strategies yeah that's the part where it  doesn't work because i uh  beat my head on the wall until i break
KcF2KP0zgM0,3490799,3496640,through you know but there are some  games that just don't let me do that and  uh i i'm excited especially whenever you
KcF2KP0zgM0,3496640,3501920,have like these more off-the-wall  solutions because i think really what  you know techdown you were saying about
KcF2KP0zgM0,3501920,3507359,like gaming being dead right what does  that really mean it means like the ideas  that people have had for like let's say
KcF2KP0zgM0,3507359,3513359,15 years for tower defense right it's  something that like for the first time  you think to yourself you know what
KcF2KP0zgM0,3513359,3518880,maybe it doesn't actually have to play  like that maybe you know we don't need  to have like established lanes maybe it
KcF2KP0zgM0,3518880,3524960,doesn't need to do this exact thing same  with the immortal exactly because  there's there's a lot of companies that  are like afraid to innovate like like
KcF2KP0zgM0,3524960,3531119,we're like break like  why try something new when you can  already do what you know what works but  i think we've seen a lot of innovation
KcF2KP0zgM0,3531119,3538000,tonight 100 percent  oh i'm i'm very excited i certainly am  like i i think i might try the i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,3538000,3544400,probably gonna play that uh that helmets  game i am yeah i'm gonna see what it's  like yeah absolutely
KcF2KP0zgM0,3544400,3550160,but i guys i want to say again uh is  that  just make sure that you guys vote for
KcF2KP0zgM0,3550160,3558640,the games that you guys enjoy a lot  we're going to have the discord link  again in chat it's on the otk network  discord because as i said before fifty
KcF2KP0zgM0,3558640,3565520,thousand dollars as well as some pcs  some razer pcs powered by intel are  going to be provided for you all today
KcF2KP0zgM0,3565520,3570559,and uh for these uh these different  studios that win so uh anyway i'm pretty
KcF2KP0zgM0,3570559,3576480,much good how do you guys feel about him  good yeah i'm excited  all right well rich go on ahead i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,3576480,3583280,ready yeah you know i'm very excited for  this next genre as somebody who's been  told that he looks like luigi his entire
KcF2KP0zgM0,3583280,3588720,life the next category definitely really  does resonate with me it's time for
KcF2KP0zgM0,3588720,3598000,platformers  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3598000,3603040,this next one also resonates with me as  well because when you actually do look
KcF2KP0zgM0,3603040,3612040,at how the controls work the legs are  going to be even more awkward than my  jokes it's lock pickles new game robotry
KcF2KP0zgM0,3630270,3675450,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3675450,3678599,[Applause]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3680640,3688240,i've always been a huge fan of games  like robotry where you actually do have  to overcome the movement i played a lot
KcF2KP0zgM0,3688240,3694160,of coop and games like that so excited  to see everything rogue poetry will  bring to the table you can add it to
KcF2KP0zgM0,3694160,3700240,your steam wishlist right now so you can  see as soon as it is available now the  next game is unlike anything that we've
KcF2KP0zgM0,3700240,3706540,seen yet today it's from biscuit locker  and it's called the catbox paradox
KcF2KP0zgM0,3706540,3754319,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,3754319,3760799,i'm really cheering for that little guy  when you actually do watch the cat  running around you think about the  schrodinger paradox and how it's both
KcF2KP0zgM0,3760799,3767440,alive and dead at the same time much  like my streaming career but for this  one we actually do get to hear more
KcF2KP0zgM0,3767440,3772480,about the game's development this is one  of the most heartwarming stories that i  actually got to hear leading into the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3772480,3779280,games expo asman's going to be talking  to both of the devs right now uh they're  named mr ben and mr bobs and they
KcF2KP0zgM0,3779280,3785039,actually put this game together right  around the beginning of kelvid as a way  to kind of stay in touch i don't want to
KcF2KP0zgM0,3785039,3791440,say too much about it i'll let them  actually talk about the creation of the  game and you can actually download
KcF2KP0zgM0,3791440,3798160,catbox paradox right now it's available  for download on steam so if you want to  check it out during the games expo you
KcF2KP0zgM0,3798160,3804400,can go ahead and do that before we take  even this deeper look at what went into
KcF2KP0zgM0,3804400,3811280,the development process and what the  game's all about and what the goal  actually was for making this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,3811280,3817760,because like i said a little bit earlier  it really is one of those games that  going in to the games expo we heard the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3817760,3823599,story about the game's development and  that was one of the reasons that we did  want to put it into the spotlight and
KcF2KP0zgM0,3823599,3829039,actually get to check it out we only  have three games as well in the  platformer category so after we check
KcF2KP0zgM0,3829039,3836079,out this interview we're gonna be  jumping into the last one  and uh we have a few more genres as well
KcF2KP0zgM0,3836079,3843280,we're gonna take a look at some of the  genres that we are going to be looking  at today as we get ready for that
KcF2KP0zgM0,3843280,3850079,interview we already i think covered  about four of them next up we're going  to be taking a look at party games from
KcF2KP0zgM0,3850079,3856960,there we're going to be taking a look at  shooters as well and  i believe after that we're going to be
KcF2KP0zgM0,3856960,3863119,getting into the simulation games i'm  very excited to check out that category  and see everything that sear has to say
KcF2KP0zgM0,3863119,3869760,about that  but  when we do put our attention back on the  platformers we have a lot of surprises
KcF2KP0zgM0,3869760,3875359,in the final game as well and for the  cat box cat box paradox we do have that
KcF2KP0zgM0,3875359,3882799,interview getting ready very shortly  here with asmin gold so i can see asthma  gold right now very excited to get his
KcF2KP0zgM0,3882799,3888880,chance to actually talk about it asthma  what did you think about that game i  thought it was cool man like i gotta go
KcF2KP0zgM0,3888880,3895039,back and watch the trailer so the cat  goes black and white back and forth i  think that's pretty like i've never seen
KcF2KP0zgM0,3895039,3900160,something that does that before and i  think it's a it's an interesting game i  think that's one of the uh one of the
KcF2KP0zgM0,3900160,3905680,most the the coolest things about  looking at some of these games is like  taking a completely new idea completely
KcF2KP0zgM0,3905680,3912400,new perspective on something and trying  something that especially i think one  aspect of this that's really underplayed
KcF2KP0zgM0,3912400,3918480,is the visual identity of it because it  looks very appealing it looks like  something that you've you know you've
KcF2KP0zgM0,3918480,3924400,never really seen something like that  before in the same way obviously like  the graphics again it like i forgot who
KcF2KP0zgM0,3924400,3929680,it was that mentioned this uh it was  bruce talking about games they played in  the computer lab in fifth grade i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,3929680,3935200,i was doing a lot of that back whenever  i was about high school at that time and  so yeah i i love these games i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,3935200,3942240,they're really cool and especially  whenever they have like a cool little  gimmick like that that gives you a  little bit of like kind of a uh you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,3942240,3947680,back and forth and the uh the the co-op  game jumping around and everything you
KcF2KP0zgM0,3947680,3954000,like that yeah i mean that's one of  those games yeah instantly you know  you're gonna see a lot of streamers play
KcF2KP0zgM0,3954000,3960319,it and they're gonna freak out like  you'll even see the people who you know  as much as they try they're not they  stream but they're not necessarily good
KcF2KP0zgM0,3960319,3966160,at games you know like quinn i am  currently better than him at diablo it's  not a huge deal but you know what is a
KcF2KP0zgM0,3966160,3972000,huge deal how great the catbox paradox  does look i just got word that the  interview is ready asthmatic let's
KcF2KP0zgM0,3972000,3978559,actually learn about the game all right  yeah i'm very excited about this so uh  thank you all very much uh mr bin and mr
KcF2KP0zgM0,3978559,3985200,bobs for joining us and i'm really kind  of curious i've heard that you all have  a pretty interesting story of how you
KcF2KP0zgM0,3985200,3993359,became uh you know became friends and uh  when you guys started making games  together so how'd it all happen ah hi uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,3993359,3998960,yeah we uh we started making games when  we were children um  back in school and uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,3998960,4004480,we were games on the on the sinclair zx  spectrum uh or hit program in basic
KcF2KP0zgM0,4004480,4011200,and we released them on tape oh wow  so a long time ago yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,4012160,4018319,and then  uh it was a brief hiatus of um 30 years  i think and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,4018319,4023359,we thought we'd have to go again um so  we uh took up godot
KcF2KP0zgM0,4023359,4029760,during lockdown  and tried to make a game and  kind of prototyped a few ideas and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,4029760,4035039,it just kind of went on from there  really  that is crazy so 30 years y'all went on
KcF2KP0zgM0,4035039,4041839,hiatus came back you make this game it's  on the expo and everything that is that  that's that's a cool story i like that a
KcF2KP0zgM0,4041839,4047839,lot what's the game about it's like the  cat like  it changes colors
KcF2KP0zgM0,4048799,4055359,yeah absolutely so as you mentioned it's  based on this i'm showing his cat  paradox i've got a cat being both  simultaneously dead or alive and we've
KcF2KP0zgM0,4055359,4061440,sort of symbolized that with the black  and white colors  so during the game you can switch um  using the the button just to switch
KcF2KP0zgM0,4061440,4066720,between the black cat and the white cat  and as a black cat you can't touch  anything that's white and there's a  white cat you can't touch anything
KcF2KP0zgM0,4066720,4071920,that's black although that's quite a  simple mechanic overall we've really had  fun trying to see
KcF2KP0zgM0,4071920,4079760,where that idea can take us and you know  we've hopefully come up with lots and  lots of ideas making a kind of  fast-paced and fun little um with lots
KcF2KP0zgM0,4079760,4084799,and lots of variety as well a little  platform game  i think it looks pretty cool like i can
KcF2KP0zgM0,4084799,4090160,see it being one of those things where  it's like it seems really simple to do
KcF2KP0zgM0,4090160,4096159,and then whenever you actually start  playing the game you just get your ass  beat and so i'm pretty excited to see
KcF2KP0zgM0,4096159,4101920,that absolutely and what really was your  your goal with making this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,4103040,4109600,just have a um of fun and challenge  ourselves and sort of make something  like we wanted to make when we were kids
KcF2KP0zgM0,4109600,4117278,in that kind of  uh era  um but obviously we couldn't and then  nowadays it is so much easier and so
KcF2KP0zgM0,4117278,4122560,much better  and so yeah it was really just uh just  to have a bit of fun and yeah we got a
KcF2KP0zgM0,4122560,4128159,lot of positive feedback from  playtesters um  and players and we just thought well we
KcF2KP0zgM0,4128159,4134080,should we should put it out there  that is honestly like for me personally  i think that's really cool because
KcF2KP0zgM0,4134080,4140000,whenever i was a kid i did like  animation and other types of stuff like  that and it's like back then the
KcF2KP0zgM0,4140000,4145838,technology you had was just like so much  worse so like going back and seeing what  people are capable of doing now and like
KcF2KP0zgM0,4145838,4151600,really kind of finishing the unfinished  is really awesome so thank you guys so
KcF2KP0zgM0,4151600,4158798,much and the game is available right now  on steam is that right  that's what yeah awesome okay yeah so if
KcF2KP0zgM0,4158798,4164159,anybody wants to go and play a cat box  paradox you can go ahead and do that  right now on steam thank you very much
KcF2KP0zgM0,4164159,4169758,mr bob and uh mr bin i appreciate it and  uh good luck with the future of your  game
KcF2KP0zgM0,4169758,4176080,thanks rick thank you thank you  man like i think that is like i i i
KcF2KP0zgM0,4176080,4182480,i think that's really cool like me and a  two of my friends whenever we were in uh  you know like on summer vacation we made
KcF2KP0zgM0,4182480,4188640,these like animation games together and  i don't know it's like very nostalgic  for me to see that even though it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,4188640,4196159,never really happened to me it's just  like i remember how cool that was and  seeing two guys come together and do  that after so many years is just uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,4196159,4201440,very personal for me yeah no it's a  great thing to see and also when you  start to look at the mechanics of it as
KcF2KP0zgM0,4201440,4208320,well that simple mechanic has a lot of  potential to really just change how the  entire game does work but we have one
KcF2KP0zgM0,4208320,4215440,more game here in our platformers that  we are going to be talking about and for  this one i don't know what else to say
KcF2KP0zgM0,4215440,4221280,besides the fact that my excitement is  almost as huge as its creator's ego this
KcF2KP0zgM0,4221280,4227000,one is made by miss kiff and it's called  unrooted
KcF2KP0zgM0,4227950,4251390,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,4257600,4262319,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,4262719,4270159,if you want to stay up to date with  everything  with this game you can follow him on  twitter right now at unrooted game and
KcF2KP0zgM0,4270159,4276080,we're going to get to talk to the  developer of the game just a little bit  more ms kipp he's sitting with asmin and
KcF2KP0zgM0,4276080,4282159,emeru right now let's hear about  unrooted  yeah uh this game has actually been a
KcF2KP0zgM0,4282159,4288000,passion project for the past two years  i've been  uh i'm actually kind of nervous about  this because i know people been asking
KcF2KP0zgM0,4288000,4294000,about this game i've gotten hundreds of  reddit posts aspen is that really what  you're gonna look like when i'm shouting  at my game
KcF2KP0zgM0,4294000,4299120,oh no no i was just i was thinking about  something else this one anyway back to  what i was saying so a lot of people
KcF2KP0zgM0,4299120,4305360,been asking about this game and i'm  super excited to finally talk about it  um basically how it happened is i was at
KcF2KP0zgM0,4305360,4311199,an airport and i was playing platformers  i've been playing platformers  pretty much every day for the past few
KcF2KP0zgM0,4311199,4317760,years i love jump king i love uh  other platformers junking is really good
KcF2KP0zgM0,4317760,4323280,and uh  i always wanted to be able to make one  of these games i always wanted to create
KcF2KP0zgM0,4323280,4328800,one and i thought the best way to do it  was with my community
KcF2KP0zgM0,4328800,4335920,but it wasn't because what happened was  i hired a bunch of people for my from my  community and they all lied about what
KcF2KP0zgM0,4335920,4342880,their resumes were and they actually  couldn't do anything oh yeah i i i've  done that before yeah so i had to rehire
KcF2KP0zgM0,4342880,4349440,a bunch of people and  i was able to hire an amazing team from  my community still uh we have some crowd
KcF2KP0zgM0,4349440,4356080,favorites this girl named courtney she's  in my chat right now and we have coaster  music as well  who made a lot of the music in the game
KcF2KP0zgM0,4356080,4362719,and it just been a crazy project for the  past two years i never knew how  expensive making a game really was so
KcF2KP0zgM0,4362719,4367920,speaking of expensive uh how many micro  transactions you're gonna have in the  game well i was getting to that so right
KcF2KP0zgM0,4367920,4373840,now you know it's an expensive game we  will have nfts available right after  this okay so  uh if you guys want to follow the
KcF2KP0zgM0,4373840,4379840,unrooted twitter it is unrooted game on  twitter i believe  but yeah it's just a passion project
KcF2KP0zgM0,4379840,4386080,that we've been working on the artwork  is fantastic yeah anyway guys yeah  i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,4386080,4392320,the cat i like the cat game too like  honestly platformer i think it was like  a really cool like back and forth where
KcF2KP0zgM0,4392320,4398080,you could go in the black and white it  was like life and death and all that  kind of stuff it was a really really new
KcF2KP0zgM0,4398080,4403840,idea that just completely changed  everything i like the zero gravity stuff  on the platform yeah yeah you go up in
KcF2KP0zgM0,4403840,4409440,the air and you fly around i mean miz  the cat box game was good right yeah  yeah the cap catbox chain was very good
KcF2KP0zgM0,4409440,4416400,i like the devs they're very nice uh my  devs are actually great too but the cat  game was fantastic i love it uh i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,4416400,4421760,chat's gonna love this one it's very  creative and the devs working together  it's very nice story it's a very nice
KcF2KP0zgM0,4421760,4427360,story i certainly like it a lot and all  right okay no memes
KcF2KP0zgM0,4427360,4433520,that's the first time i really saw the  trailer it actually looks pretty good  dude right yeah it looks like it  actually looks good so we actually
KcF2KP0zgM0,4433520,4440400,copied uh orion the blind forest because  that game sold really well that's good  because you just do something that  somebody else does yeah so it's like
KcF2KP0zgM0,4440400,4446640,your stream exactly you're talking to me  hey i know you're going to react to this  when you go home no of course i will
KcF2KP0zgM0,4446640,4452000,be like wow that was a good joke i was  really funny there yeah true  true myself
KcF2KP0zgM0,4452000,4458480,exactly  yeah chad for any of these games you  guys see right now you can head over to  the discord which is i believe the otk
KcF2KP0zgM0,4458480,4465280,discord uh go ahead over there there is  a panel or a place you can vote for all  the games like asman said first place
KcF2KP0zgM0,4465280,4471840,gets thirty thousand dollars i believe  second place gets 20 000 right yep and  they both get a uh a razer pc that's got
KcF2KP0zgM0,4471840,4478000,intel inside of it too intel stuff is  powered by intel uh i i think that's a  lot especially i mean pc is getting a
KcF2KP0zgM0,4478000,4484480,whole gaming pc now especially i don't  know really how bad the clip shortage is  now but it's over a thousand bucks
KcF2KP0zgM0,4484480,4491600,that's a lot of money so for people that  want to develop a game and actually  render it and make it work the way they  want i think this is a tremendous bonus
KcF2KP0zgM0,4491600,4498880,for them because you've got to keep in  mind like for every massive game  developer that are making millions of  dollars because they've got 18 different
KcF2KP0zgM0,4498880,4504719,kinds of loot boxes in the game i'm not  thinking about anybody in particular but  um any of that kind of stuff uh you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,4504719,4511120,for every one of those there's hundreds  of people thousands of people out there  trying to just make a little game  something just a little bit of something
KcF2KP0zgM0,4511120,4518400,special and that's what we really want  to empower today and make happen so i'm  i'm excited i am i think it's cool and
KcF2KP0zgM0,4518400,4525280,i'm curious to see what's going to  happen with these uh uh with these other  games  me too i think these games are looking

KcF2KP0zgM0,5031120,5036800,all right jesse thank you very much for  coming on talking about the game  renowned i'm gonna be honest
KcF2KP0zgM0,5036800,5041920,it looks [ __ ] awesome so  you guys uh rust came out and it came
KcF2KP0zgM0,5041920,5048480,out a while ago but it's had like a  massive renaissance everybody's been uh  been playing russ nowadays what what
KcF2KP0zgM0,5048480,5053920,made you want to do basically uh  medieval rest  well i mean it's been
KcF2KP0zgM0,5053920,5060800,it started probably eight years ago i  mean yeah i went to rmit which is a  school in melbourne okay i met charlie
KcF2KP0zgM0,5060800,5067199,who is uh the other co-founder of rdbk  studios and it was actually the first  conversation i had with him uh he was
KcF2KP0zgM0,5067199,5074159,explaining russ to me and it just  sounded like the best game ever i played  it that night until the early hours of
KcF2KP0zgM0,5074159,5080560,the morning  and from that moment  that game was just for me the best  experience so far um
KcF2KP0zgM0,5080560,5087199,and also at the same time we're playing  chivalry medieval warfare  and in the same sort of vein the um
KcF2KP0zgM0,5087199,5092960,combat system was just so intuitive and  as we played both these games  religiously for
KcF2KP0zgM0,5092960,5098080,years  we just kept talking about this medieval  survival that you know raiding with
KcF2KP0zgM0,5098080,5105440,trebuchets and battering rams  and incorporating a directional base  combat system that it just eventually
KcF2KP0zgM0,5105440,5111120,was  so good of an idea we couldn't not make  it um  and then we finished school
KcF2KP0zgM0,5111120,5117120,and we started and uh yeah from that  point we just built a team  and they're just the most dedicated guys
KcF2KP0zgM0,5117120,5122639,like it  it's unparalleled the quality and speed  we get through this stuff it's fantastic
KcF2KP0zgM0,5122639,5128480,the quality and the speed that sounds  good uh  when's it gonna come out man
KcF2KP0zgM0,5128480,5134239,okay so  the timeline i guess from now to release  is basically uh we've got steam next
KcF2KP0zgM0,5134239,5139600,fest happening on the 13th of june uh so  very very soon and we've got a um combat
KcF2KP0zgM0,5139600,5145440,demo that's free for people to play uh  so we implore you to come and give that  a shot it's just basically the combat
KcF2KP0zgM0,5145440,5151840,version of the game  after that maybe a month or two past  that point we've got raid module which
KcF2KP0zgM0,5151840,5157760,is if you imagine you took all the  survival systems into a short sort of  game mode we're going to give that to
KcF2KP0zgM0,5157760,5164480,our backers and testers uh to to  solidify those systems it's basically  like a a small game where two teams
KcF2KP0zgM0,5164480,5169840,fight together they craft and build  their castles and raid and it's a way we  can test
KcF2KP0zgM0,5169840,5175360,all the systems in in one place  from there  test and create the full survival game
KcF2KP0zgM0,5175360,5181360,from that testing period  for hopefully a release in early access  maybe
KcF2KP0zgM0,5181360,5186560,mid next year we hope but of course  these things change but we can't wait to  get it in your hands that's for sure how
KcF2KP0zgM0,5186560,5191840,many people can be on the server like  because i think about like a medieval  fight i'm thinking like kingdom of
KcF2KP0zgM0,5191840,5198080,heaven lord of the rings there's a lot  of people there how many well we're  hoping to have a hundred players on a
KcF2KP0zgM0,5198080,5203600,server i mean we never really envisioned  uh renowned to be these huge
KcF2KP0zgM0,5203600,5209440,battles or as much as it's cool i'm sure  some people will make some servers where  that's possible yeah but for us it was
KcF2KP0zgM0,5209440,5216239,actually like the a core like community  like a little close-knit clan where  you're allying with people around you
KcF2KP0zgM0,5216239,5221920,fighting over hot spots of resources  it's that sort of like social  connections between smaller groups which
KcF2KP0zgM0,5221920,5227840,we want to capitalize on for sure so you  have like those small like what do you  think in like eight man teams something
KcF2KP0zgM0,5227840,5233600,like that four to eight man teams  exactly literally that's exactly what  we're balancing to and then we're going
KcF2KP0zgM0,5233600,5240639,to be  hopefully doing our weekly wipe cycles  we might go to bi-weekly but we think  for the replay ability a week works
KcF2KP0zgM0,5240639,5246159,quite well okay so it's it's going to be  like it you're going back and forth  you're building up you're getting busted
KcF2KP0zgM0,5246159,5252719,back down you do it all over again is  that exactly  okay yeah i'm excited so uh june what
KcF2KP0zgM0,5252719,5257760,was it 13th is that you said  that's correct so steam next fest
KcF2KP0zgM0,5257760,5262800,free to play for anyone for about a week  so yeah and also join our discord and  let us know what you think because we

KcF2KP0zgM0,5307280,5313360,time this is one with renown i really  feel like this is the perfect fit for it  yeah no 100
KcF2KP0zgM0,5313360,5320960,i think uh i mean as when you you and i  were cut from the same cloth we like  knights armor big freaking swords i i
KcF2KP0zgM0,5320960,5327280,think renown looks really really  exciting you know it's just one of those  games i i'm so excited like i remember i  first started playing rice whenever they
KcF2KP0zgM0,5327280,5333840,had that first uh server that we made  yeah twitch with everybody on it and  like i had such a good time i would
KcF2KP0zgM0,5333840,5339360,steal everybody's horse on that server  yeah it's one of my favorite things to  do i uh would take a day off a stream
KcF2KP0zgM0,5339360,5344960,just so i could run around and hide  under somebody's base and break it down  but like this it's like especially no
KcF2KP0zgM0,5344960,5350239,really that's what i did i would i would  steal those things i run them back to my  stable i remember i actually i was
KcF2KP0zgM0,5350239,5355760,playing i would log in and i think the  first time i encountered your stable i  was just running around like off the
KcF2KP0zgM0,5355760,5361040,side of a beach or something and i see  this big house and i and i open it and  there's just horses lined up and
KcF2KP0zgM0,5361040,5367040,everybody's getting their horses stolen  they have no idea where they're going  and it's asman literally has like 20  horses sitting in this stable and just
KcF2KP0zgM0,5367040,5372960,you're a horse thief i mean you were  collecting mounts even in rush what are  you gonna do with those horses man uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,5372960,5380400,well usually like i would honestly the  thing is that i had to build a bigger  team because we employed one person just
KcF2KP0zgM0,5380400,5386080,to feed all the horses  wow yeah like that we actually we turned  this into an industry so i'm really
KcF2KP0zgM0,5386080,5392560,curious  i'm curious to see what this is going to  be like i look at the graphics i look at  the way the game plays and it's like i
KcF2KP0zgM0,5392560,5398560,mean i see chopping down trees i'm  thinking of you know just that that new  world late night experience sitting in
KcF2KP0zgM0,5398560,5405120,the dark and so i just am so so excited  to see this game but there's a number of  other ones as well like yeah there's so
KcF2KP0zgM0,5405120,5411120,many good ones here which one do you  like well i mean fueled up looks  fantastic literally just overcooked in
KcF2KP0zgM0,5411120,5417520,space i mean that's that's the yeah  yeah well i think i think the big thing  too is uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,5417520,5422800,we'll just tell them the truth guys we  need some stream content you know and we  do our game nights every wednesday we do
KcF2KP0zgM0,5422800,5429440,our otg game nights every wednesday and  we're looking all these party games and  uh even when we were going through the  trailers we were like dude we got to
KcF2KP0zgM0,5429440,5436080,play this one we got to play this one  and i know uh i mean all these games  really but you know you mentioned fueled  up mini game madness matriarch i mean
KcF2KP0zgM0,5436080,5442320,you name it uh and even even  unfortunately some things that we did  don't even get to show in the expo uh  there were just so many good submissions
KcF2KP0zgM0,5442320,5448400,we had to uh we had to narrow it down  for the sake of the show i mean  absolutely and uh you guys see we've got  a lot of the really really good ones
KcF2KP0zgM0,5448400,5453440,here and i have to say i like fueled up  too as well like it was a lot like the  uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,5453440,5459600,and especially the otk game night like i  am so sick of you guys playing gang  beasts and throwing me off the edge
KcF2KP0zgM0,5459600,5465760,i'm tired of this man i'm like what's  going on i i want to play gang beasts  so far i'd wanted to play gang beasts
KcF2KP0zgM0,5465760,5472800,like every week because i basically just  get to go harass asman which is one of  my favorite pastimes i literally throw  me off the edge it's like
KcF2KP0zgM0,5472800,5479360,i feel like palpatine minigame madness  yeah life if we had otk game night in  real life yeah had everyone in like
KcF2KP0zgM0,5479360,5486800,antarctica yeah and just pushing each  other off cliffs and exactly yeah could  go wrong yeah no i personally i'd love
KcF2KP0zgM0,5486800,5493040,to play mini game madness with ludwig  ludwig you down man oh my god just  kidding just kidding just yeah yeah yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,5493040,5498159,no thanks man no we'll let you know yeah  i i don't know i'm i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,5498159,5504080,i've got to say like i am so excited  about this renowned game i think that  this type of survival game especially
KcF2KP0zgM0,5504080,5509760,like team-based survival games where  it's like pvp  and it's in a medieval setting i am just
KcF2KP0zgM0,5509760,5515280,so so hyped up for that so i might  actually even play the uh combat demo  because i think it's one of those games
KcF2KP0zgM0,5515280,5521199,like  especially with something like renowned  what really makes a game like that uh  you know fun is that you know you've got
KcF2KP0zgM0,5521199,5526320,a one week two week wipe cycle so it's  mainly about like building up and like
KcF2KP0zgM0,5526320,5531440,the play experience on a day-to-day  basis so like making sure that that is
KcF2KP0zgM0,5531440,5537600,like pristine on point precise and fun  to do i think that if you do that  everything else just fits together i
KcF2KP0zgM0,5537600,5543440,think i think fresh in any game like one  of you got a chance to to wipe it and go  fresh and start from the beginning it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,5543440,5548880,fun for everybody because you have  people that that's just what they do  they just like going fresh and they like
KcF2KP0zgM0,5548880,5554080,just from the beginning over and over  and over again or there's people that  were like oh i i didn't do well on the
KcF2KP0zgM0,5554080,5559760,last wipe and these are all my excuses  these are all my reasons but this time  this time i'll do it it's going to be
KcF2KP0zgM0,5559760,5565280,different this yeah guys they're in the  cycle dude they're in the cycle  i'm going to get all the sniper rifles

KcF2KP0zgM0,5700320,5706159,that one looks great having a hair gun i  wish that existed in real life but we're  gonna take a look at the next game this
KcF2KP0zgM0,5706159,5732520,one's from dids and it's called project  sparrow  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,5749170,5788119,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,5793350,5796560,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,5801679,5807119,two very different games right now to  kick off the shooters but they do have  one thing in common you can play both of
KcF2KP0zgM0,5807119,5813040,them right now so when you actually do  look at fashion police squad you can  play the early demo you can download
KcF2KP0zgM0,5813040,5818560,that right now on steam but for project  sparrow you can download the entire game  so if you want to check them both out
KcF2KP0zgM0,5818560,5825119,you can head over to steam and play them  both today but we're already starting to  see shooters are going to have a pretty
KcF2KP0zgM0,5825119,5830800,large variety a lot of things falling  under this umbrella we got two more  games to check out but we're going to
KcF2KP0zgM0,5830800,5835840,take a deep dive on project sparrow  asman is with the game developer right
KcF2KP0zgM0,5835840,5840880,now for an interview  okay i mean i'm gonna be honest guys
KcF2KP0zgM0,5840880,5846800,like i feel like this is the kind of  game that i would get my ass beat in  like it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,5846800,5852800,it's like you have to be so precise with  the shots and i'm really excited to see  kind of like
KcF2KP0zgM0,5852800,5860080,where do you really where'd this game  really come from what was the  inspiration for it and kind of what's  your story in making this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,5860080,5865840,yeah so  about five years ago i just really  wanted to make well there was no games  that were
KcF2KP0zgM0,5865840,5871600,had bows and arrows or anything like  that so i just wanted to  make a shoot a game that had bose just a
KcF2KP0zgM0,5871600,5877840,sick game  so it's a shooter game and like you're  like customizing your arrows and your
KcF2KP0zgM0,5877840,5884159,bow like what's the kind of stuff that  you can do are there special abilities  like what what what's really on the  table here
KcF2KP0zgM0,5884159,5889199,yeah so at the start of every round  there's uh 13 rounds in the game first  or seven at the start of each round you
KcF2KP0zgM0,5889199,5897040,can pick an arrow type so you've got  like fire arrows shadow arrows and smoke  arrows so you can like shadow arrow tp
KcF2KP0zgM0,5897040,5902719,shoot your enemy from behind you've got  a utility section as well that you can  pick from so you can
KcF2KP0zgM0,5902719,5909040,choose if you want a smoke bomb or a  satchel or a throwing knife just to  pretty much help your play style rather
KcF2KP0zgM0,5909040,5914320,than just having abilities that one shot  you so  that's kind of the just game
KcF2KP0zgM0,5914320,5920560,yeah i mean i i see it and it just seems  like it's like so so precise and so fast
KcF2KP0zgM0,5920560,5926320,i can't even imagine like other  abilities so you can teleport around and  like what what what does a fire arrow do
KcF2KP0zgM0,5926320,5933040,does it kind of just like shut down a  certain area on the map or what  yeah so you just fire a fire arrow you
KcF2KP0zgM0,5933040,5940320,just swap to it with your arrow type and  then  wherever it hits it makes a fire like  aoe okay so if you've got someone who's
KcF2KP0zgM0,5940320,5946800,three peeing you and they won't move out  of cover you just  fire arrow they have to move and you can  shoot them
KcF2KP0zgM0,5946800,5953920,is there a uh is there a team version of  this like i i think a lot of these were  1v1 can you do with the teams as well
KcF2KP0zgM0,5953920,5959199,yeah so there's 1v1s 2v2s 3v3s you can  one within deathmatches as well there's
KcF2KP0zgM0,5959199,5964480,custom games  and spectator mode as well so oh wow  okay so this is the kind of game that
KcF2KP0zgM0,5964480,5971199,like you can pretty much if you're a fan  of fps and just like the finite or not  finite but like the the fickle nature of
KcF2KP0zgM0,5971199,5976800,like moving around and being super  precise this is a game for people that  are aficionados of that people that
KcF2KP0zgM0,5976800,5982000,really like that kind of gameplay  yeah uh and ironically it was never
KcF2KP0zgM0,5982000,5988239,intended but the movement in the game  yeah is uh  just been getting  harder and harder and it's really hard
KcF2KP0zgM0,5988239,5993520,to match to the movement in project  sparrow now okay  yeah  through play testing
KcF2KP0zgM0,5993520,5999360,uh we just kept adding i just kept  adding new stuff wall bouncing and then  dashes and then being able to dash in
KcF2KP0zgM0,5999360,6006000,the air  and then it's just  it's really fluid if you can master the  movement yeah i i can see that i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,6006000,6011679,it's absolutely one of those games that  just becomes harder and harder to play  the longer that you play it so i want to
KcF2KP0zgM0,6011679,6019440,say thank you so much for coming on and  uh again uh project sparrow is available  now on steam is that right
KcF2KP0zgM0,6019440,6025280,yep steam early access 20 off right now  as well there you go thank you very much  for coming on talking about your game

KcF2KP0zgM0,6190719,6197840,choo choo charles hold fast nations at  war  um you know which game uh stuck out to  you guys
KcF2KP0zgM0,6197920,6203440,how about you  you know when i go first  i want to hear your opinion me yeah i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,6203440,6209119,supposed to just feel like the fasting  game fits you you know that would be  your favorite the fashion game was great
KcF2KP0zgM0,6209119,6214320,uh it was a 2d game you know it was you  know fun lighthearted i'm using like 2d
KcF2KP0zgM0,6214320,6220719,like  art so it's kind of cool the art style  in that game stuck out to me a lot that  that's more a finn's alleyway yeah i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,6220719,6226560,kind of into fashion you know i got  burberry  i like it i like the graphics and i like
KcF2KP0zgM0,6226560,6232320,the guns  the gameplay is just fluent yeah uh my  favorite thing about this is actually
KcF2KP0zgM0,6232320,6238400,the golden toilet because the the best  time for me is when i'm able to use the  bathroom and you know recharge you ever
KcF2KP0zgM0,6238400,6244400,used a bidet  i used to crazy yeah i used to but i had  to stop using it it just i spent too
KcF2KP0zgM0,6244400,6250080,much time on it not not of a day guy  myself personally  he's here
KcF2KP0zgM0,6250080,6256159,nick help me with the name because i was  down there preparing for battle what's a  choo choo game  choo choo charles yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,6256159,6262639,so choo choo charles is a game it's  actually like i was watching that that  is the game i will play i actually am
KcF2KP0zgM0,6262639,6269360,i'm afraid of playing horror games what  do you think about the choo choo with  the spider legs like running four when i  was growing up uh thomas the tank was
KcF2KP0zgM0,6269360,6277600,like my thing growing up and this i can  tell so you was one of those yeah what's  that i could you can tell can't you yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,6279360,6285440,that's like  one of the worst shows yeah it's just a  personality trait  so you're more of a chuggington type of
KcF2KP0zgM0,6285440,6290480,guy i never even heard of that you see  it's too old okay  yeah but
KcF2KP0zgM0,6290480,6296960,so tutu charles it's a scary uh train  game you know it's a fps game you can  you know level up your train as you go
KcF2KP0zgM0,6296960,6303520,as you can see here so i love games  where you you basically build up the  armor of the train yeah and you also  have to make sure the train keeps going
KcF2KP0zgM0,6303520,6308639,right uh i don't know but you can you  can it looks like bad guys will get you  if the train doesn't get going yeah i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,6308639,6314320,not even sure how you win this this  might one of those games where you're  just surviving i think when you get to  ohio that's like a survival time yeah a
KcF2KP0zgM0,6314320,6320000,little note there seems to be a  navigation element to this game too  that's really interesting the  integration of the map feature is really
KcF2KP0zgM0,6320000,6325679,fluent yeah it seems compelling yeah  this uh this this train is horrifying  like look at it that is absolutely scary
KcF2KP0zgM0,6325679,6333360,any scary shooter game needs a  good antagonist and that thing is  nightmare fuel yeah impressed so uh finn
KcF2KP0zgM0,6333360,6338480,how do you feel about uh hold fast  nations at war well this game has been  established uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,6338480,6344000,and already has an incredible community  i that's what i know about this game  i've spent hours watching gameplay
KcF2KP0zgM0,6344000,6351280,videos youtube all hilarious the player  interactions that game mixed with the  combat environment is is super good so
KcF2KP0zgM0,6351280,6356480,i i love hold fast  well this is not hold fast but it's also
KcF2KP0zgM0,6356480,6361920,a good game how i felt about how fast  i'm not really a fan of beans on toast
KcF2KP0zgM0,6361920,6370880,and [ __ ] like that me neither beans  i like the game you know this is pretty  cool i feel like a toast it's uk
KcF2KP0zgM0,6370880,6376159,is that what they eat beans on toast  i think i think yeah that's uh have you
KcF2KP0zgM0,6376159,6381920,ever eaten beans on toast absolutely not  i don't know  i don't i don't even eggs i have a
KcF2KP0zgM0,6381920,6387040,question yeah  do you think that you would be good at  any of these games personally and i mean
KcF2KP0zgM0,6387040,6394159,this  without  no no cap okay i would be in the top .01
KcF2KP0zgM0,6394159,6400480,of every single one of these games  i am better than shroud
KcF2KP0zgM0,6400480,6405760,there you have it fighting words  fighting words coming out of nick  trout
KcF2KP0zgM0,6405760,6412000,yeah he knows yeah i like shrewd yeah  he's cool yeah um so uh finn anything
KcF2KP0zgM0,6412000,6417040,else you wanna you wanna add i'm talking  about project sparrow as well we haven't  mentioned that one yet the arena base
KcF2KP0zgM0,6417040,6424880,shooter also looking pretty spicy  anything that has to do with movement  and projectile combat i'm interested in
KcF2KP0zgM0,6424880,6430800,yeah and this game seems to have those  elements it's looking fun that's what  i'm good at any game where it introduces
KcF2KP0zgM0,6430800,6435920,fps elements you put me in that hot seat  and guaranteed i'm gonna be at the top  of the charts i've been playing fps
KcF2KP0zgM0,6435920,6441600,professionally for years i used to be a  trick shotter black ops 2 you know when  i was like 12 years old so i like the
KcF2KP0zgM0,6441600,6447520,the high ross you know things that they  could jump off of and also like spin  around i like seeing that it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,6447520,6454639,interesting to me yeah if you want me to  be completely honest if uh if i actually  played this game i am not good with
KcF2KP0zgM0,6454639,6460159,arrows and projectiles i'm this is the  one game that i actually wouldn't be in  the top in in fact i would probably
KcF2KP0zgM0,6460159,6466320,be the worst at this game i i just don't  know how to like lead my shots and  things like that i'm just never you're
KcF2KP0zgM0,6466320,6471920,like that with guns as well in games  right yeah of a sit down to pee type of  guy yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,6471920,6478000,how do you how did you know that i do it  too okay yeah yeah absolutely absolutely
KcF2KP0zgM0,6478000,6484080,i'm all for it  finn how do you think you do at uh you  know
KcF2KP0zgM0,6484080,6489360,sparrow  i think i do great nick i think i'd do  super good in that arena based
KcF2KP0zgM0,6489360,6494880,game and i think i would 360 no scope  you take you out of the game immediately
KcF2KP0zgM0,6494880,6500000,and then it's betty buy time for nick  huh yeah okay it's probably 6 30. all
KcF2KP0zgM0,6500000,6505280,right  well guys um anything else you want to  add
KcF2KP0zgM0,6507679,6514400,um  okay um  let's get back to rich
KcF2KP0zgM0,6514400,6519520,that was awkward hello i'm back on the  stage it's time to take a look at the

KcF2KP0zgM0,6536960,6543600,now and then i'm a human but if there  was a game that simulated life i could  play it and potentially get better at
KcF2KP0zgM0,6543600,6550800,real life through a simulation and  that's exactly what we do have as we  start to take a look at this section the

KcF2KP0zgM0,6995760,7002080,now now with ages of kataria there's a  whole bunch more that i want to dive  into and really want to just learn more
KcF2KP0zgM0,7002080,7008320,about the game as you can see from that  trailer there are a whole bunch of  different avenues of progression and a
KcF2KP0zgM0,7008320,7016040,whole lot of moving parts so asmin is  standing by for an interview with the  game's director
KcF2KP0zgM0,7016960,7024400,hey what's going on uh can can they hear  me  oh okay hi uh okay well this game is
KcF2KP0zgM0,7024400,7030320,quite interesting i'll have to say it  really is uh what inspired you all to  make this
KcF2KP0zgM0,7030320,7036239,well right off the bat uh losing our  jobs inspired us i was writing about how  to clean your gutters
KcF2KP0zgM0,7036239,7043920,um and nicole yet soon um i was  bartending at the time obviously neither  of our jobs were really that fun um and
KcF2KP0zgM0,7043920,7049280,we were both looking for a way to get  back into a creative industry somewhere  where we could work with a team of
KcF2KP0zgM0,7049280,7054960,people and create something fantastic  and amazing um and that is how agents of
KcF2KP0zgM0,7054960,7060880,kataria was born we decided to start our  own company um because we applied to all  of these game companies and they
KcF2KP0zgM0,7060880,7067760,rejected us because we had no experience  so we decided to just do it ourselves  well i like that
KcF2KP0zgM0,7067760,7074320,what was missing from colony sim games  was really connecting with your  villagers and seeing them grow
KcF2KP0zgM0,7074320,7079360,yeah i think so can like okay so  whenever they die their spirits go into
KcF2KP0zgM0,7079360,7085760,the tree is that right  yeah exactly it makes the tree bigger  yeah so your tree kind of symbolizes
KcF2KP0zgM0,7085760,7092000,like the growth of your town so over  like the months that you play as if  people pass on they'll go into the tree
KcF2KP0zgM0,7092000,7098000,and they'll be able to talk to your  villagers who are there and give you  items and stuff like that so it's not  like they're gone forever but they're
KcF2KP0zgM0,7098000,7103920,there in spirit right  how big can the tree get  um that tree that you saw is like our
KcF2KP0zgM0,7103920,7109840,final version of it it's like the  fullest it will get okay so it's right  now it's a big boy
KcF2KP0zgM0,7109840,7115599,oh he's a baby okay all right i like  that small yeah so can you tell me a  little bit more about the game the
KcF2KP0zgM0,7115599,7120880,trailer didn't really cover  yeah totally so we  for
KcF2KP0zgM0,7120880,7127440,the biggest thing is really aging and  it's getting the really the generational  aspect of the game so your villagers  will age over real world weeks so when
KcF2KP0zgM0,7127440,7132960,you're offline they're aging and they're  having events happen in their lives for  small and huge like these can be major
KcF2KP0zgM0,7132960,7138719,events like traumas or even like huge  victories that happen in their life they  go on adventures
KcF2KP0zgM0,7138719,7145199,you'll be able to build in the game and  customize your town your way something i  really didn't like about other city  building games is that your town kind of
KcF2KP0zgM0,7145199,7151599,looks like a cookie cutter town yeah  it's very similar to other games um and  really collecting animals and uh that
KcF2KP0zgM0,7151599,7157599,run wander into your village raising  them to your animals who live in your  town and the relationships that are
KcF2KP0zgM0,7157599,7163040,interconnected all your villagers are  connected they know each other you know  you'll have like your favorite villager

KcF2KP0zgM0,7182880,7188080,i've never seen a game that really does  that before so i i like to see it and if

KcF2KP0zgM0,7213280,7220400,where we connect with our community  every week well thank you so much for  coming on i really appreciate it and i  find a game it's uh especially with the
KcF2KP0zgM0,7220400,7227920,generational aspects i i i think it'll  be so funny people that get like  emotionally attached to one villager and
KcF2KP0zgM0,7227920,7233599,yeah absolutely it reminds me of the old  tamagotchis in a way you know yes we are
KcF2KP0zgM0,7233599,7240639,here to shake you to your core and then  lift you back up and like pet you yeah  i like that okay that's ideal well thank
KcF2KP0zgM0,7240639,7247920,you so much for coming on i appreciate  it and good luck with your game  thank you nice to meet you you too
KcF2KP0zgM0,7248639,7255199,oh boy oh boy oh boy we got ourselves s  fanned and tech tone here to talk about
KcF2KP0zgM0,7255199,7260239,the simulation game how do you guys feel  dude  just first i don't know if there's
KcF2KP0zgM0,7260239,7266239,something wrong with me but i i looked  at ages of kataria and i just came  thinking to myself
KcF2KP0zgM0,7266239,7271920,i want to build a big village  and i just want to build the biggest  baddest tree that i can as fast as
KcF2KP0zgM0,7271920,7276719,possible but that would mean i would  have to kill off the whole thing
KcF2KP0zgM0,7277040,7282719,jesus  my god  well that's why i asked about how big
KcF2KP0zgM0,7282719,7288080,the tree can get yeah yeah i guess yeah  you gotta know what it is all right tech  time what do you think dude i love
KcF2KP0zgM0,7288080,7293520,simulation games because you get to  relive the pain of like the real world  but that's a cute anime cat girl yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,7293520,7298639,yeah exactly or like a leaf girl  apparently yeah this story yeah that's  cool i
KcF2KP0zgM0,7298639,7303840,for me the game i really liked a lot was  steel guardian the vr game yeah and like
KcF2KP0zgM0,7303840,7311760,it it didn't like really get me until  that dude popped up and he was fighting  this skeleton that was so cool to me
KcF2KP0zgM0,7311760,7318320,because like how far can that go because  like a lot of the first person like  medieval combat games sometimes they can
KcF2KP0zgM0,7318320,7323679,not really play that well but in vr i  bet it would be a completely different  experience it is it's a completely
KcF2KP0zgM0,7323679,7329520,different experience because like as  you're standing up for hours on end with  the remotes in your hand eventually you  start to feel like the weight of like
KcF2KP0zgM0,7329520,7334560,the shield and like real world fatigue  starts to like come into play for these  vr games because i started playing a lot
KcF2KP0zgM0,7334560,7340960,and uh it's cool it's good it's so bold  the immersion is crazy i've never played  a vr game before in my life you sure i
KcF2KP0zgM0,7340960,7347520,mean vr is sick  yeah yeah all right all right might make  you a little bit sick if you play for  too long yeah yeah but
KcF2KP0zgM0,7347520,7353360,i heard yeah once you start doing vr you  just get lost in it right like you see  like the anime cat girls that you
KcF2KP0zgM0,7353360,7360470,already like but imagine if you felt  that they were real standing in front of  you i uh one time i saw a soda pop and  stream and i almost had that experience
KcF2KP0zgM0,7360470,7366320,[Laughter]  yep that's about right you know what i  really liked was uh i i really like both
KcF2KP0zgM0,7366320,7373520,abras and uh and roboco right because i  like a lot of puzzle games like the the  thinking game stuff like that and uh i i
KcF2KP0zgM0,7373520,7378880,feel like abras  it looks like well there's two parts to  this one i was one of those kids that i
KcF2KP0zgM0,7378880,7384320,would like to build up legos and i would  build a building and i would just smash  it
KcF2KP0zgM0,7384320,7391119,so average kind of reminded me of that  but it's it's like physics-based it's  they're physics-based puzzles so um it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,7391119,7398880,it's  a game that like if you play gta i i  don't like the newest gta gta 5 it's new  but like 10 plus yeah but um
KcF2KP0zgM0,7398880,7404800,i i i always like to run cars into stuff  and i really enjoy seeing like actual  mechanics in physics yeah it's it's fun
KcF2KP0zgM0,7404800,7411199,yeah so uh being able to take that and  have these physics based puzzles i think  is really cool and also with roboco you
KcF2KP0zgM0,7411199,7416880,had um did you see he was shaking the  vending machine yeah i thought he was  going to pull it over on the dude i
KcF2KP0zgM0,7416880,7423199,thought  he like this dude's about to get got  yeah  no i love it i love the puzzles i love
KcF2KP0zgM0,7423199,7429280,the building uh little things and and  kind of uh seeing how they develop so  i'm uh i i thought both of those looked
KcF2KP0zgM0,7429280,7434320,really really good as well yeah yeah i  was i was really into steel guard in  ages of kataria because when they when
KcF2KP0zgM0,7434320,7441040,it introduced the concept of like  getting older with like real real time  like weeks yeah that's so cool like
KcF2KP0zgM0,7441040,7446159,aging with the game feeling  stressed out if like it was a guy i  liked a lot yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,7446159,7452400,because i remember one time like there  was a i had this little these little  things back in the 90s they're like  these little toys there's a tamagotchi
KcF2KP0zgM0,7452400,7457520,and you take care of a cat and like  eventually i came home and my mom was  like
KcF2KP0zgM0,7457520,7462639,zach oh no we gotta talk we gotta talk  about your tamagotchi i'm like why
KcF2KP0zgM0,7462639,7468400,she's like i did my best i tried as hard  as i could  but it's again let's just say this it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,7468400,7473599,game over yeah yeah i had the same  experience with neopets i've gone  through like three grundos they're all
KcF2KP0zgM0,7473599,7478880,dead it blows  that's great i i don't know i think that  the the puzzle games and like the
KcF2KP0zgM0,7478880,7484719,simulation type games like that i i  think they're really cool and also  especially the vr ones i'm really
KcF2KP0zgM0,7484719,7491679,excited to see like basically i want to  know how long it's going to be and so we  can play sword art online in real life
KcF2KP0zgM0,7491679,7497840,like that's really i mean  that's  my  that's the end goal okay guys
KcF2KP0zgM0,7497840,7503280,like yeah that's the grand prize let's  get to that and i'll be happy for sure  for sure
KcF2KP0zgM0,7503280,7509280,every year i see these games and they  get better yeah no it's it's crazy i  feel like we're close  honestly
KcF2KP0zgM0,7509280,7516719,i do them i say next ten years tops next  are you for sure yeah no 100 percent  okay okay okay i think you know again we
KcF2KP0zgM0,7516719,7522719,talked a lot about puzzles right and  this isn't even like the puzzle games  right these are simulation games but uh  i think we got a whole lot more puzzle

KcF2KP0zgM0,8010560,8017440,those games you know a lot of solid  puzzles a lot of games we have seen  before but it looks like they're taking  a new little twist to it um i mean i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,8017440,8023599,excited a lot of them seem like my  brains can't handle it you know so i  can't no no
KcF2KP0zgM0,8023599,8030880,neither could yours like you're not like  you're you're not  damn  it was a good carry though
KcF2KP0zgM0,8030880,8037520,um  all right sir how do you feel about him  i have to say i love the last cube uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,8037520,8042560,dynamic tron like visuals stunning  intense uh it looks like there's very
KcF2KP0zgM0,8042560,8048480,very satisfying results when you  actually solve a puzzle  uh which to me is great because to be
KcF2KP0zgM0,8048480,8055119,honest chance  i'm not that smart and i actually really  struggled puzzle games so when i  actually do solve something
KcF2KP0zgM0,8055119,8060560,i love to have that satisfying like  and everything gets colorful when you  solve a solve a problem well you look at
KcF2KP0zgM0,8060560,8065679,this here you ever see that piece of  paper where you unfold it entirely it's  a cube it's shaped like a cross almost i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8065679,8071599,have no idea what you're talking about  okay well either way you look at this it  looks my head starts to hurt trying to
KcF2KP0zgM0,8071599,8078159,land the symbols onto the right you know  things on the floor it's just just like  old you wouldn't be able to do it either
KcF2KP0zgM0,8078159,8085280,bruce  as the youngest up here bruce how do you  feel about the last two these games have  in common like
KcF2KP0zgM0,8085280,8091679,all of these games are the type of game  that i will put on and yell at my chat  for not helping me find the right
KcF2KP0zgM0,8091679,8097360,you know  but being a pro telltale gamer it's all  about making the right choices at the
KcF2KP0zgM0,8097360,8104320,right time and i feel like the last cube  i used to play this in the computer lab  too but they added different elements i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8104320,8110560,really like that what is that you see  the way it's moving  the little guy like that's i don't even  know what's going on so we are supposed
KcF2KP0zgM0,8110560,8116480,to be the variety experts and us three  have admitted we cannot solve these  puzzles
KcF2KP0zgM0,8116639,8121920,what is that what does that mean  so i don't know this game is interesting  because it it my head hurts and i'm just
KcF2KP0zgM0,8121920,8127679,watching someone that seems to know what  they're doing i i've it's it looks hard  how did you feel about uh headless jeff
KcF2KP0zgM0,8127679,8132719,three uh i was actually a bit confused  is it like you have the robot and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,8132719,8138320,you have the head point of view as well  and headless  robot missing his head trying to find
KcF2KP0zgM0,8138320,8144400,his head without his eyes i think  anyway i think what's going on there um  if we can get headless jeff up here it
KcF2KP0zgM0,8144400,8151280,it seems like you take your head off and  you place it down and you control where  the perspective is okay so you can't it
KcF2KP0zgM0,8151280,8156480,seems like maybe you can't solve the  puzzle right now you need to put your  head down like it's a camera and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,8156480,8162320,you see and now you solve it so it's a  fun controller perspective and see he's  going to pick his head up pick up the
KcF2KP0zgM0,8162320,8168239,camera can you throw your head i don't  know maybe and you have to use your head  as a problem solving tool probably
KcF2KP0zgM0,8168239,8174320,multiple times maybe yeah it looks again  it looks like a really fun unique puzzle  game i'm cool to see this here looks
KcF2KP0zgM0,8174320,8179440,like the movie robots too i like that  movie yeah it's cool art style as well  and how do you guys feel about a
KcF2KP0zgM0,8179440,8184480,harmonies odyssey it's uh it has a ton  of like uh cute puzzles and brain
KcF2KP0zgM0,8184480,8190239,teasers how do you feel about it that's  like classic spot to difference  situation i told you that while we were  watching because you didn't know what
KcF2KP0zgM0,8190239,8195840,you were looking yeah and taking what no  enchantment  no no no i made the observation that it
KcF2KP0zgM0,8195840,8201920,was a classic comparison game and i told  that to chance i had to explain it to  him i think you might actually just be
KcF2KP0zgM0,8201920,8206960,copying everything chance does  are you guys comparing notes oh yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,8206960,8213518,yeah okay hey should i be here i don't  think so at this point bruce what do you  think i think he should be here and also
KcF2KP0zgM0,8213518,8218558,about this game i like the fact that  it's like something that you can play  with friends you want to get your
KcF2KP0zgM0,8218558,8224478,friends involved in the late night you  know what i'm saying how do you get  those put it on the monitor because it's  kind of everyone kind of sits around i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8224478,8230478,have none  do you have friends dude shut up so  you're sitting in the living room
KcF2KP0zgM0,8230478,8236478,and you just put it on the screen and  the friends are all looking you're  trying to spot the difference we played  a game like that recently and it's it's  actually really fun it's like where's
KcF2KP0zgM0,8236478,8243439,waldo yeah we're taking to the next  level of you know this third person game  yeah so um in the final game was escape
KcF2KP0zgM0,8243439,8249920,academy it's like uh  that was scary i really like this one  you do how do you feel about it
KcF2KP0zgM0,8249920,8255040,to be honest  it just reminds me of one of those games  that didn't trap themselves in a box
KcF2KP0zgM0,8255040,8261598,being in one room and being that only  level yeah that's why i was really  interested in it because japan greece
KcF2KP0zgM0,8261598,8268638,you could go to different places in the  world and  escape the room  that's pretty hard oh that's what that
KcF2KP0zgM0,8268638,8274080,was this game remember we played the  game called we were here do you remember  that yeah it's like that a lot only you  know they've got it seemed like they
KcF2KP0zgM0,8274080,8280319,have a lot really in-depth story to it  so it's a it's an escape room you know  it's called escape academy and it's just

KcF2KP0zgM0,8338240,8345598,games maybe he'll be able to beat them  but now it's time to look at a brand new  category this is one that i think all of
KcF2KP0zgM0,8345598,8351518,the people in this room right now really  kind of met each other through games  like this ladies and gentlemen we're
KcF2KP0zgM0,8351518,8355558,going to be taking a look at rpgs
KcF2KP0zgM0,8357000,8363439,[Music]  rpgs are definitely a pretty broad
KcF2KP0zgM0,8363439,8369120,category so we're just gonna dive  straight into the action the first one's  coming from good morning games and this
KcF2KP0zgM0,8369120,8380859,one's called night crawlers  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8383019,8391389,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8394210,8397570,[Music]

KcF2KP0zgM0,8435359,8440720,we got another nick game coming from  rose tinted games this one is called gen
KcF2KP0zgM0,8440720,8446080,fanard  genericity unlike ours
KcF2KP0zgM0,8446080,8453840,companies are seeking profit at all  costs  there is a shortage of labor  the board needed results fast
KcF2KP0zgM0,8453840,8460479,having the internet design monsters  proved challenging  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8460479,8465840,people seem to like cosmetics  at first
KcF2KP0zgM0,8465840,8472080,appealing to speedrunners  let's just forget that one
KcF2KP0zgM0,8472080,8475600,then the new trailer rolled in
KcF2KP0zgM0,8478479,8484720,the corporation for licensed heroics  wants you to join our adventure for  those who think clicking on trees all
KcF2KP0zgM0,8484720,8490319,day is relaxing  watch your every accomplishment be  distilled down to a number and then

KcF2KP0zgM0,8508399,8515680,color shirt to wear so many items you'll  run out of bank space hundreds of  hand-drawn monsters all looking to kill
KcF2KP0zgM0,8515680,8521920,you play alongside dozens of other  adventurers  join a world where most people stand
KcF2KP0zgM0,8521920,8527359,around in banks all day the corporation  is seeking profit and you are how we'll
KcF2KP0zgM0,8527359,8534800,get it  that's perfect
KcF2KP0zgM0,8536640,8543120,yeah the story of that one definitely  spoke to me uh with a lot of the games  that i've played over the years we got a
KcF2KP0zgM0,8543120,8548319,lot going on with the games inside of  this genre the next one is definitely
KcF2KP0zgM0,8548319,8553439,going to be a curve ball for a lot of  you and i'm particularly excited for  this one let's take a look at kin fire
KcF2KP0zgM0,8553439,8564520,chronicles  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8573970,8577080,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8611910,8615379,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8627670,8633398,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,8640960,8646399,as you can see there's a lot going on  there that's different than anything  that we've seen so far today i am very
KcF2KP0zgM0,8646399,8651840,excited to dive into this because i want  you guys to hear all about incredible  dream and to hear about ken fire
KcF2KP0zgM0,8651840,8657280,chronicles some of the people working on  it made some of my favorite experiences  in gaming but
KcF2KP0zgM0,8657280,8664319,i don't need to do the talking because  we actually do have an interview right  now it's going to be asmin sitting down
KcF2KP0zgM0,8664319,8670720,with the ceo and co-founder and talking  about everything that's going on
KcF2KP0zgM0,8670800,8675920,hey how are you doing uh thanks for  coming on  yeah thank you so much absolutely uh if
KcF2KP0zgM0,8675920,8680960,anybody doesn't know this is a ceo of uh  what's called incredible dream am i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8680960,8687280,right sorry i almost messed that up um  jane shanghai is that right yes okay yes  it is and so could you tell us a little
KcF2KP0zgM0,8687280,8694560,bit about kind of your journey before  this and like kind of what led you to  starting this company and making  everything happen yeah sure thank you um
KcF2KP0zgM0,8694560,8701040,so i've loved games all my life i think  everybody here can relate to that and um  you know i've i've met friends in in
KcF2KP0zgM0,8701040,8707040,games i've uh escaped in games i've met  my husband in games and i've been in the  game industry for about 12 over 12 years
KcF2KP0zgM0,8707040,8714160,now professionally and  you know basically and yeah i some  people may recognize uh i've worked on i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8714160,8719840,was the executive producer for arcane  which is the league of legends animated  series on netflix um i think everybody
KcF2KP0zgM0,8719840,8727200,knows about that thank you so much we're  very fortunate that it did it did pretty  okay um but uh i think overall like i
KcF2KP0zgM0,8727200,8733760,served my time uh working for these big  gaming companies and i helped build one  and  you know at some point i finally thought
KcF2KP0zgM0,8733760,8739920,like what if right and maybe that sounds  familiar i just thought like you know  what if we just went off and did our own
KcF2KP0zgM0,8739920,8745280,thing and so um you know i co-founded an  incredible dream with some some folks
KcF2KP0zgM0,8745280,8750880,that i really liked and we just really  wanted to make a different kind of game  really based on the experiences that
KcF2KP0zgM0,8750880,8756640,we've had playing d and d and board  games and a bunch of other rich  experiences that we've particularly had
KcF2KP0zgM0,8756640,8763200,over the last couple of years yeah i bet  and whenever you talk about like you  know playing games over the years there  were a lot more games back in the day
KcF2KP0zgM0,8763200,8768399,that it was a little bit harder to make  a reality and now it seems like almost  anything is possible but what you're
KcF2KP0zgM0,8768399,8775439,doing is you're going back and you're  making a tabletop game and so what  really is the uh what what is it why
KcF2KP0zgM0,8775439,8780880,what's the tabletop game yeah yeah um  i think like if if if you guys are like
KcF2KP0zgM0,8780880,8787760,me at all then you probably spend a lot  of hours in front of a screen uh for  work or school or you'll probably also
KcF2KP0zgM0,8787760,8793680,spend a lot of hours in your personal  time playing games on screens um so my  thinking is like really when you meet
KcF2KP0zgM0,8793680,8799920,with your friends in person  uh chances are they probably like games  too  why not play games offline with them
KcF2KP0zgM0,8799920,8805920,through tabletop through board games  right like  kin fire chronicles is a really special
KcF2KP0zgM0,8805920,8812160,it's a different kind of social game  that you really experience with with  others at the table uh we have a
KcF2KP0zgM0,8812160,8817760,card-based combat that really promotes  like cooperative shared turns mechanics  and really interesting different things
KcF2KP0zgM0,8817760,8823600,that you don't really see even in video  games today  we have a choose your own adventure  style narrative that you can play
KcF2KP0zgM0,8823600,8829120,through and really kind of experience  what people experience in dnd and sort  of that shared theater of the mind tells
KcF2KP0zgM0,8829120,8834560,you the stories yes exactly and  it's so much more about you and your  friends around the table than it is
KcF2KP0zgM0,8834560,8840240,about like graphics or grinding or  griefers so it's mainly a focus much  more around the social elements of the
KcF2KP0zgM0,8840240,8846720,games rather than the graphics or  anything like that it's just all about  kind of how to make that experience that
KcF2KP0zgM0,8846720,8853280,you know a lot of us grew up having how  to make that as authentic as possible  yes exactly okay well that's great well
KcF2KP0zgM0,8853280,8859920,how would somebody be able to support  the project and how would they be able  to pick up ken fire chronicles yeah so  we are going to be
KcF2KP0zgM0,8859920,8865760,launching our kickstarter on august 9th  and you can sign up right now on  kinfirechronicles.com for exclusive
KcF2KP0zgM0,8865760,8872240,sneak pre peaks  invites to join our play test um as well  as some special pricing and we're gonna
KcF2KP0zgM0,8872240,8878640,make a version of our game available  online to play virtually if you can't uh  you know find a copy of the game to play
KcF2KP0zgM0,8878640,8884880,physically and we're also gonna don't  wanna leave your house or you don't  wanna leave your house that's true i can  never tell um
KcF2KP0zgM0,8884880,8892160,uh and yeah so we're gonna make this all  available uh pretty soon so go ahead go  sign up and uh that's what i also wanted
KcF2KP0zgM0,8892160,8898000,to offer like we'd love to have the otk  crew come play our game uh stream if  you'd like and
KcF2KP0zgM0,8898000,8903520,well so so this was the game that we  played uh on discord and we got a little  bit of an idea about it and everything
KcF2KP0zgM0,8903520,8908640,yeah i actually kind of liked it i mean  i think that the what i enjoyed a lot  about the game is the fact that it had
KcF2KP0zgM0,8908640,8913680,kind of like a little bit of an on-rail  storytelling but at the same time you  could deviate from it and kind of just
KcF2KP0zgM0,8913680,8918880,do whatever you want i think that's the  really great middle ground that a lot of  people because you know doing an entire
KcF2KP0zgM0,8918880,8925760,dungeon dragons campaign is really hard  like we've done it ourselves rich and i  have and it takes a lot of work and so
KcF2KP0zgM0,8925760,8930880,you have like the pre-made ones that you  can also deviate from and do different  things and it kind of spreads out in a
KcF2KP0zgM0,8930880,8936960,web almost right yeah exactly it's um  it's such a fun experience being able to  create this journey with your friends at
KcF2KP0zgM0,8936960,8943040,the table and  yeah the game's there to kind of give  you the structure and guideline  but it's really up to you at the table
KcF2KP0zgM0,8943040,8948800,to really uh role play at it and really  bring bring each moment to life right  okay all right yeah that makes a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,8948800,8954720,sense and again it's going to be on  kinfirechronicles.com  jane from incredible dream thank you so
KcF2KP0zgM0,8954720,8960319,much i appreciate it thank you so much  absolutely yep  and uh rich i think it's back to you
KcF2KP0zgM0,8960319,8966080,yeah i am excited to talk about that  just a little bit more because as you  mentioned we did get a small chance to
KcF2KP0zgM0,8966080,8972000,actually play the game and a lot of  people already know i am a huge fan of  actually getting to play tabletop games
KcF2KP0zgM0,8972000,8977840,not only d and d but also games like  arkham heart which have a really unique  narrative experience and guess what the
KcF2KP0zgM0,8977840,8985040,people who made that are working on this  experience so if that's the type of  thing you like definitely check it out  it's going to be very unique to anything
KcF2KP0zgM0,8985040,8990160,else that you would be able to play and  i'm also excited that you can play it  online because every single time i try
KcF2KP0zgM0,8990160,8996399,to play something  that's actually a tabletop game with asm  and he refuses to leave his house so  maybe we'll actually be able to play
KcF2KP0zgM0,8996399,9001439,this one together but as we move through  the rpg section in general asthma will
KcF2KP0zgM0,9001439,9007359,actually probably ban me in his chat for  saying this but i'm kind of bat-testing  irl this is one of my favorite genres in
KcF2KP0zgM0,9007359,9014560,games and the next one  actually got me very excited too it's  coming from bellular studio coffee box
KcF2KP0zgM0,9014560,9019840,games ltd let's take a look at the pale  beyond
KcF2KP0zgM0,9025040,9030479,so you're looking a job eh  let me tell you what you're getting  yourself into
KcF2KP0zgM0,9030479,9037520,we'll be sealing aboard the temperance a  rescue vessel sent out to found our  sister ship lost in the ice
KcF2KP0zgM0,9037520,9042800,as my second in command you'll be  responsible for 24 crew members
KcF2KP0zgM0,9042800,9049359,well 36 if you count to sled dogs  i suggest you study the crew manifest
KcF2KP0zgM0,9049359,9056560,get to know everyone and try to keep  them on your side you could save lives  one day because forbid the cold takes me
KcF2KP0zgM0,9056560,9062080,or the ship  not leave you in charge
KcF2KP0zgM0,9063760,9069359,life on the ice is cruel  will you make the choices no one else
KcF2KP0zgM0,9069359,9076239,can't  [Music]  promise me you'll do right with the crew
KcF2KP0zgM0,9077760,9083120,whatever it takes  let's just hope it doesn't come to that
KcF2KP0zgM0,9083120,9089159,shall we  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9095760,9102479,so asmin i'm not sure have you actually  gotten a chance to play or deep dive  anything with pale beyond yet honestly i
KcF2KP0zgM0,9102479,9108640,haven't seen anything about it and uh so  this is guys this is belliour's game and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9108640,9115680,a lot of people might not know this but  based off of that premise it's actually  very very close to something that  happened in real life it was a ship that
KcF2KP0zgM0,9115680,9122000,got caught in the antarctic they were  trying to go all the way around the  world it got iced over and uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,9122000,9128399,they did have to eat the dogs oh  the titanic no it was uh before that oh
KcF2KP0zgM0,9128399,9134240,yeah it was before that and i think  pretty much all of them survived but it  was a massive undertaking and i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,9134240,9140479,that's really cool to actually take  something that actually kind of happened  in history and then make it into a
KcF2KP0zgM0,9140479,9145680,legitimate game  yeah and also you know one of the things  that i'm pretty excited about you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,9145680,9152319,with bellular uh you you kind of know  that uh the game's probably gonna have a  very different monetization scheme than
KcF2KP0zgM0,9152319,9159280,we've seen in other games recently i uh  i'll be curious you know like what if it  had um you know a dozen different loot
KcF2KP0zgM0,9159280,9166000,boxes what's he gonna do play all the  way into it whatever and i don't know  i i really like the thing that i like
KcF2KP0zgM0,9166000,9172880,about a lot is that it takes like that  uh that you know like grizzly aesthetic  of you know going and being you know out
KcF2KP0zgM0,9172880,9178160,on the sea back in the 1700s or 1800s  where there's no cell phones there's no
KcF2KP0zgM0,9178160,9184560,gps or anything like that you're just  out there surviving and i as somebody  who's like i've read some of these
KcF2KP0zgM0,9184560,9190399,stories that's how i know  i i think it's badass yeah no definitely
KcF2KP0zgM0,9190399,9196319,i i think that one of the cool things to  do as well would be to talk to bellaire  sometime more about the game maybe we
KcF2KP0zgM0,9196319,9201920,get them on all craft or something soon  and actually get to take a deeper look  but we do have some more games to look
KcF2KP0zgM0,9201920,9211479,at as well so let's take a look from a  game coming from gullyberry studios this  one is called ethereal echoes of your
KcF2KP0zgM0,9212530,9227790,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9236240,9253200,so  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9259410,9271459,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9273520,9288329,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9291030,9300011,[Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,9311200,9317200,i'm really excited to unpack that one  just a little bit more it definitely i  can tell it draws a little bit of
KcF2KP0zgM0,9317200,9322960,inspiration from one of the first games  that really drew me into gaming where uh  asman actually i think he's one of the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9322960,9329280,only people who knows the story about  just uh how much i loved it and how much  i dived into it and lucky for us i see
KcF2KP0zgM0,9329280,9336000,him smiling over there but now we're  gonna throw the camera over there as  well because asmin is ready for an  interview with the lead designer from
KcF2KP0zgM0,9336000,9341359,ethereal echoes of your  hey what's going on man how you doing
KcF2KP0zgM0,9341359,9348399,hi pretty good hello asman hey chat how  are you guys uh it's been a while i've  saw this game over the past like month
KcF2KP0zgM0,9348399,9355040,or so and i've had a lot of people bring  it up to me and it's pretty cool to see  it actually here at the games expo and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9355040,9361840,really what was your inspiration around  making ethereum  so ethereal actually we started working
KcF2KP0zgM0,9361840,9368479,on ethereal eight years ago and we'd  kind of gotten tired of the current mmo  scene because we felt like it was very
KcF2KP0zgM0,9368479,9373760,cookie cutter  linear progression you know and and we  felt like the soul had been taken out of
KcF2KP0zgM0,9373760,9380880,the genre in a way yes so that's kind of  how it started and and what we did is  being an engineering team we we just
KcF2KP0zgM0,9380880,9387439,started like at the we started to learn  and we just took our time with it and  made sure we made all the core systems
KcF2KP0zgM0,9387439,9394319,uh as they should be and  that's kind of how it just kept on  growing you know we just wanted to  create like this immersive fantasy world
KcF2KP0zgM0,9394319,9399680,so you have like people that are  building like uh cities and different
KcF2KP0zgM0,9399680,9404960,houses and buildings together and you  also have like guild housing because i  remember whenever i first saw the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9404960,9410080,trailer i was like oh this is okay you  know it's all right right but then  whenever i saw everybody building stuff
KcF2KP0zgM0,9410080,9416479,together i was like wow this is this is  really cool  yeah so all the building in uh on the on
KcF2KP0zgM0,9416479,9423520,the continent of era mesa it's massive  and it's non-instant so if you as a  guild you own a  plot you can actually as guild masters
KcF2KP0zgM0,9423520,9429120,and officers you can assign  plots to infrastructure which you can  use for like roads or marketplaces and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9429120,9435439,then you can also assign them to like  individual guild members so if a guild  member has done a lot of work getting  the plot or if you want to give them a
KcF2KP0zgM0,9435439,9441439,house of their own  they can start building and all the  building is grid based so you can even  dig down and you can build basements you
KcF2KP0zgM0,9441439,9447200,can build up into uh well quite a lot of  floors  so yeah it's very free in that sense and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9447200,9452240,we feel like the building aspect of it  is a very big part of the game i think  that looks really really cool i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,9452240,9458399,excited to see that and you're talking  about the soul of mmos what are some of  the uh design philosophies behind this
KcF2KP0zgM0,9458399,9464560,game  so  all of like the core mechanics of  ethereal like the crafting and the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9464560,9469840,gathering and the exploration and  adventure part of it they're very like  deep mechanics but in our opinion it
KcF2KP0zgM0,9469840,9475840,doesn't matter how good mechanics you  have if they're not all tied together  though one of the core philosophies of
KcF2KP0zgM0,9475840,9482319,ethereal is like if you want to be a  master craftsman like let's say a  blacksmith for example then you should  impact the server
KcF2KP0zgM0,9482319,9489600,because you are a blacksmith right so  you would be getting special kinds of  quests and you would be contributing to  the server's economy as a blacksmith so
KcF2KP0zgM0,9489600,9495040,that's how you chose to play and you can  do this for leatherworking you can do  this as a combat character an adventurer
KcF2KP0zgM0,9495040,9500800,as a as a tradesman with a caravan so  that's kind of the idea is is we want to  build like this immersive play style
KcF2KP0zgM0,9500800,9506160,where you're building your character  it's not just like uh oh congratulations  you're the chosen one which we see so
KcF2KP0zgM0,9506160,9512720,much in games today it's like you make  the character you want to make and then  the game has mechanics that allow you to
KcF2KP0zgM0,9512720,9518479,interact with the game itself and as a  result of that since the servers are  built up by these dynamic events the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9518479,9524640,player take a part in every server on  ethereal is different so okay you might  have a world boss on one server where
KcF2KP0zgM0,9524640,9531920,the players failed to kill it and now  the town is destroyed but on another  server they might have cleared the raid  boss or a world bus and that town is
KcF2KP0zgM0,9531920,9538319,just fine on that server so that's kind  of the way that players are interacting  as a community and changing the outcome
KcF2KP0zgM0,9538319,9543920,of the servers yeah i think that's  really interesting and especially  whenever you get into like the impact
KcF2KP0zgM0,9543920,9549439,that players can have on a server on  like a macro and a micro level i think  that's really one of the most
KcF2KP0zgM0,9549439,9555040,interesting things for these games  because people oftentimes like mmos they  have
KcF2KP0zgM0,9555040,9560319,it's like the main thing that you do is  you have your combat level and then  blacksmithing leather working anything
KcF2KP0zgM0,9560319,9566399,else besides that all of those things  are secondary so in this game they are  much more of a primary
KcF2KP0zgM0,9566399,9571760,method of play as well as combat  correct so like for for uh so raids and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9571760,9578000,ethereal are very different in that the  like raids are an event that you lead up  to and up to this it could be like say  they're trying to a cult is trying to
KcF2KP0zgM0,9578000,9583600,summon a demon boss and so crafters will  be involved in this because they need to  gather magical materials that enchanters
KcF2KP0zgM0,9583600,9589760,and blacksmiths will create like wards  like anti-magic wards in the game to  make the raid boss actually manageable
KcF2KP0zgM0,9589760,9595200,or easier or what not so real firsts are  not only tied to the best combat players
KcF2KP0zgM0,9595200,9600399,but they're also tied to having the most  dedicated crafters and the most  dedicated craftsmen on the server as  well
KcF2KP0zgM0,9600399,9606960,all right that's that sounds like a lot  and i gotta ask like what do you think  really is going to separate ethereal
KcF2KP0zgM0,9606960,9612080,from amon uh many other of these uh  kickstarters that
KcF2KP0zgM0,9612080,9617200,never really happened  yeah so  i think the main thing is that we have a
KcF2KP0zgM0,9617200,9622399,game like we had an open alpha that ran  through the entirety of may um we've
KcF2KP0zgM0,9622399,9628560,spent the last eight years building the  infrastructure and the tools like we're  not using any third-party libraries or  anything we've built everything from
KcF2KP0zgM0,9628560,9634800,scratch and the game is highly optimized  it's already like it's already at a  stage where all we're doing is just
KcF2KP0zgM0,9634800,9640319,shaping out content so as a result of  that we already have a game it's not  like we're promising mechanics we don't
KcF2KP0zgM0,9640319,9645920,have guild housing already works pvp  arena bg's already works gathering and
KcF2KP0zgM0,9645920,9651520,crafting already works character  progression already works you know like  we  and the tools we've made let us create
KcF2KP0zgM0,9651520,9658399,content very fast even though we're a  small team during the alpha we created  an entirely new five-man dungeon uh with
KcF2KP0zgM0,9658399,9664800,four unique bosses in it and that  dungeon with a team of four we created  in three days
KcF2KP0zgM0,9664800,9670240,it took players longer to clear the  dungeon than we took creating the  dungeon which is quite interesting how
KcF2KP0zgM0,9670240,9675600,many players can be in a dungeon  uh so we have anything from five to  twenty man
KcF2KP0zgM0,9675600,9681040,so dungeons and ethereal are what you'd  expect from like um like traditional  mmos like you just go into an instant
KcF2KP0zgM0,9681040,9686640,zone and you clear the up and all the  bosses but then raids are a separate  thing where like i said that involves
KcF2KP0zgM0,9686640,9692080,the entire community where like crafters  are involved and gatherers and traders  and so on so that's the separation
KcF2KP0zgM0,9692080,9698160,between dungeons and raids and ethereal  okay yeah i mean honestly this thing  seems pretty exciting so when do you
KcF2KP0zgM0,9698160,9705840,think it's going to be out  so we are current plans are to launch  the game on april 2023 um so it's under
KcF2KP0zgM0,9705840,9711760,a year from now and we're going to be  doing several kinds of play tests uh  throughout so make sure to follow us on
KcF2KP0zgM0,9711760,9718800,discord check out our youtube channel if  you want to deep look into the game we  also have a twitch channel ethereal  slash ethereal mmo if you want to see me
KcF2KP0zgM0,9718800,9724080,work on the game live i do some game dev  streams every now and then if you want  to come and learn something
KcF2KP0zgM0,9724080,9729439,and yeah just you know come and enjoy  the game and the tests are going to be  anything from pvp matchmaking to guild

KcF2KP0zgM0,9735279,9741520,everyone gets a key and it's going to be  a great time okay yeah thank you so much  for coming on and sharing your game as i
KcF2KP0zgM0,9741520,9747760,said i've been hearing about this back  and forth for quite a while so it's good  to finally get a chance to talk to you  thank you so much
KcF2KP0zgM0,9747760,9754479,thank you so much yeah and again guys  make sure you can add ethereal to your  steam wishlist now and we have joined
KcF2KP0zgM0,9754479,9761600,with us two other rpg experts here we  have s fan tv and sodapoppin tv how you
KcF2KP0zgM0,9761600,9767680,guys feeling  um i'm feeling good but sodapop and tv  is i'm not i thought you had that on one
KcF2KP0zgM0,9767680,9774319,of them it's your twitter so you have  that on youtube you're on twitter i do  yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought not
KcF2KP0zgM0,9774319,9781200,your right though not my twitch not the  twist okay  what do y'all think  uh go ahead i mean i i think it all
KcF2KP0zgM0,9781200,9787359,looks great you know what one kind of uh  i think one of the big themes that we're  seeing across all these rpg games they
KcF2KP0zgM0,9787359,9792960,they all kind of hearken back too like  uh the old school feel right they're  like oh like we want like an old school
KcF2KP0zgM0,9792960,9800560,mmo feel we want an old-school rpg feel  and um i think the reason for that is  honestly because the uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,9800560,9806000,the rpg player base the community people  to play rpgs are always talking about  that like oh well i want to have this i
KcF2KP0zgM0,9806000,9812720,want to have this that that i played in  that game i think it was uh  uh i think it was a genfanad that had uh
KcF2KP0zgM0,9812720,9819279,it was it was uh it drew inspiration  from runescape that talked about before  yeah so um no it's it's very very cool
KcF2KP0zgM0,9819279,9825120,to see uh that that's kind of a focal  point for a lot of these studios for a  lot of these developers and uh i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,9825120,9832479,excited to see going forward what they  come up with  i'm kind of excited to see where this  ethereal game goes because one thing
KcF2KP0zgM0,9832479,9838240,that's really interesting to me about it  is the fact that they have like these  large-scale dungeons but the difference
KcF2KP0zgM0,9838240,9843840,it seemed is it wasn't like super  fast-paced because whenever you're  talking about these dungeons oftentimes
KcF2KP0zgM0,9843840,9849359,it's just you know crazy reaction time  move out of this we're out of that this  front of that but like it's a little bit
KcF2KP0zgM0,9849359,9855760,more slowed down and more uh impactful  and deliberate and i like that
KcF2KP0zgM0,9855760,9861120,i'm looking at you know there's three  types of rpgs we have here on my list um
KcF2KP0zgM0,9861120,9867840,i was taking notes of course  um we've got a board game on this list  we've got a couple of rpgs but it seems
KcF2KP0zgM0,9867840,9873600,like we have a couple of mmos which  aren't those are no joke when it comes  right up that's that's why that's why we
KcF2KP0zgM0,9873600,9880960,ask because it's like how are you going  to make this happen like how many of  these games we have and like i've  watched how many youtube videos reacted
KcF2KP0zgM0,9880960,9888240,to them on youtube of wow look at this  mmo that raised 700 000  and in three years they've developed a
KcF2KP0zgM0,9888240,9894720,picture of a 3d model of a horse that  looks like it came out of oblivion you  know it's not exactly very promising
KcF2KP0zgM0,9894720,9899760,with these kickstarters people worry  about this but the thing with ethereal  is that they have a date for it they're
KcF2KP0zgM0,9899760,9904880,planning it and it seems like what  really made me feel confident about it  is the fact that they were talking about
KcF2KP0zgM0,9904880,9910800,how a lot of the base systems were  already done so they're not talking high  in the sky oh yeah we're going to have
KcF2KP0zgM0,9910800,9917200,this crazy cool thing  at some point in the future they already  have it done so and they're just making  the content a couple of things i noted
KcF2KP0zgM0,9917200,9923359,when you were doing your interview there  great questions by the way um he  mentioned guilds i heard building which
KcF2KP0zgM0,9923359,9929680,is pretty big i noticed there was a  healing dps and i think a tank roll  which i think is something i love in an
KcF2KP0zgM0,9929680,9936479,mmo yeah um it seems like time is  rewarded which is pretty massive and  it's going to be ready in under a year
KcF2KP0zgM0,9936479,9942000,it looks like that pvp and too i saw  arena yeah  i would have asked how many people on
KcF2KP0zgM0,9942000,9948160,the server can a server have because  like i love whenever you have like  thousands of people on a server a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,9948160,9954560,people on a server and it's like a  living breathing world i mean  the servers are different he mentioned
KcF2KP0zgM0,9954560,9961439,how you know and of course you know  you're gonna have one server that's  probably min maxed to oblivion oh yeah  where oh every world boss dead yeah but
KcF2KP0zgM0,9961439,9967279,of course you're gonna have some servers  that might be a little lower pop more  tight community based that are gonna be  way more unique and so there's gonna be
KcF2KP0zgM0,9967279,9972880,like a an attraction to all the servers  right well something that uh  something we've noticed in a lot of the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9972880,9979200,games that we've played growing up is  individual servers would have their own  culture and not every server was the
KcF2KP0zgM0,9979200,9985920,same so that's exactly what uh what  you're talking about i think it's it's  totally reasonable to think that's going  to happen i i had that happen my
KcF2KP0zgM0,9985920,9991520,original wow server was full of a bunch  of really nice people and i never really  fit in finally i went over to kel'thuzad
KcF2KP0zgM0,9991520,9997600,and there's a bunch of [ __ ] i found  it was great and so i think that's  definitely true
KcF2KP0zgM0,9997600,10004800,and like soda you're right about like  occasionally there are those servers  where all of the uh  the professional players go on those
KcF2KP0zgM0,10004800,10010399,servers you know um another game that  seemed you know to kind of hit a lot of  the nails on the head as well was night
KcF2KP0zgM0,10010399,10017120,crawlers see was that is that an mmo i'm  not really sure nightcrawler  can i see that again it it looked a
KcF2KP0zgM0,10017120,10023760,little bit more of like an arpg style it  had a lot of roguelite elements  and i think that's fun i have not played
KcF2KP0zgM0,10023760,10028880,a whole lot of roguelites  but man playing games like vampire  survivors and uh getting into it a
KcF2KP0zgM0,10028880,10035120,little bit more recently it's super  super fun i i noticed there was a boss  fight in here a big ass bird i liked
KcF2KP0zgM0,10035120,10041680,that i saw the gear the upgrades it  looked satisfying i love those kind of  games so i love seeing this um and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,10041680,10047680,we also had a board game uh yeah board  game looked pretty fun you know well  anyway we actually had an opportunity to
KcF2KP0zgM0,10047680,10053439,play it for the first time like maybe a  couple of weeks ago or so uh soda were  you there for that yeah i was yeah okay
KcF2KP0zgM0,10053439,10059680,i thought so i was making sure i was  like no breastfeeding shoulder he was  one playing oh yeah yeah that's about  right and so we tried playing this game
KcF2KP0zgM0,10059680,10066080,and we did like the online version of it  and i i think one thing that dnd can  have that like i have kind of a problem
KcF2KP0zgM0,10066080,10071200,with is sometimes things drag on and i  felt like with ken fire chronicles that
KcF2KP0zgM0,10071200,10076640,there was really good pacing to it it  wasn't something where it's like you're  sitting and making five different roles
KcF2KP0zgM0,10076640,10083359,if you're going to pick up a roll of  bread  yeah yeah i mean the team is legit you  know i was looking at some of the the
KcF2KP0zgM0,10083359,10090319,art that i was looking at like this is  high quality stuff it's it looked like a  really fun complicated board game that
KcF2KP0zgM0,10090319,10098240,you know board game extraordinaires i've  been trying to get into it i'm not i i  have friends that beg me to play all the  time um are gonna love you know rich is
KcF2KP0zgM0,10098240,10103600,over here you know he's giggling and  excitement  um so it's definitely a top of the line
KcF2KP0zgM0,10103600,10109359,board game it's gonna be exciting to see  what what jenny and the crew over there  are gonna be able to put together yeah i
KcF2KP0zgM0,10109359,10114399,mean i think so too i'm pretty excited i  i  i'm curious to see like whenever it
KcF2KP0zgM0,10114399,10121760,actually comes out like what how how one  of the campaigns plays out fully because  we only did like maybe 30 minutes like
KcF2KP0zgM0,10121760,10128479,an hour and 30 minutes somewhere around  there like play testing of it and like  of course you can't finish anything in  that time period so i'm kind of curious
KcF2KP0zgM0,10128479,10133920,to see what's going to happen whenever  the game's actually out and it's like  how expansive how many different options
KcF2KP0zgM0,10133920,10139840,do you have in these things and i think  it's going to be great we we had two  other games that we got to watch there
KcF2KP0zgM0,10139840,10145920,was um  pale beyond was on there with the the  boat uh you said something about you
KcF2KP0zgM0,10145920,10151840,knew that death it happened the story in  there actually happened uh i think it  was one of the first people like i don't
KcF2KP0zgM0,10151840,10158560,remember the guy's name they had made a  number of like books and uh and i think  even uh  an adaptation for like a movie about it
KcF2KP0zgM0,10158560,10164080,and uh you know they got stuck out in  the ice and they had to go to like  another island they went to an island  after that and they finally found some
KcF2KP0zgM0,10164080,10169439,people and they got saved christopher  columbus uh oh yeah yeah of course  that's right however i think this was
KcF2KP0zgM0,10169439,10175920,the mayflower yeah and so that's that  was one thing i thought was really cool  was it was actually kind of based on  something real yeah but you can move it
KcF2KP0zgM0,10175920,10182319,around and change it up a little bit so  i thought that was cool and also the the  agent for now what i liked about that
KcF2KP0zgM0,10182319,10188160,is that there was never any sense of  like oh  like  it's like they just said like yeah give
KcF2KP0zgM0,10188160,10193359,us money  yeah we need money yeah  yeah so you guys are gonna you're gonna
KcF2KP0zgM0,10193359,10198399,pay us money that's good  no i think it was also cool just uh to  talk about people beyond again and you
KcF2KP0zgM0,10198399,10205279,mentioned this earlier that's belarus  game yeah you know and believers talked  about it a lot and belly laura's he's a  friend of ours and we're fans of his and
KcF2KP0zgM0,10205279,10210800,uh it's just cool to kind of see like  the uh  see it all kind of come together you  know
KcF2KP0zgM0,10210800,10216240,seeing a friend's game you know kind of  like see it on the big screen i i i i  don't know believer personally but i saw
KcF2KP0zgM0,10216240,10221840,the voice act or heard the voice acting  and i was like oh this trailer is pretty  cool and then of course i saw the art of  the boat i was like this looks kind of
KcF2KP0zgM0,10221840,10227120,grim and then you tell me it's a real  story i'm like oh [ __ ]  it's even more grim yeah you know and i
KcF2KP0zgM0,10227120,10232240,saw there's probably gonna be some  serious decision making you have to make  people dying says you're the captain you
KcF2KP0zgM0,10232240,10238640,probably gotta send people off to die  otherwise everyone dies and it's like  whoa so it looked pretty cool um i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,10238640,10243680,the last game on the list was  which where is it was the ethereal
KcF2KP0zgM0,10243680,10250640,uh  not ethereal no we had pale beyond kin  fire chronicles  uh i could not pronounce this okay so or
KcF2KP0zgM0,10250640,10256560,i could not spell it gin finale getting  fed yeah yeah yeah you say it again
KcF2KP0zgM0,10256560,10261840,i think i don't know and then that that  was that was runescape inspired and yeah  it looked like okay i was gonna say yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,10261840,10268479,it looks well that's something that they  themselves have said like that's what  inspired it so um it's it's very cool to
KcF2KP0zgM0,10268479,10274319,see i personally have never played  runescape but i have a lot of friends  who love the hell out of it um i'm
KcF2KP0zgM0,10274319,10279520,looking at someone beat fire right now  does that make sense or is that a  phoenix oh well i think eventually he'll
KcF2KP0zgM0,10279520,10286160,win  both  i mean it takes takes a few hours but  you know it's like you know we're  talking about that old school mmo feel
KcF2KP0zgM0,10286160,10293359,right it's a time sync you know it's  like uh runescape inspired you know what  it now it stole its babies yeah that
KcF2KP0zgM0,10293359,10298880,their little phoenix ducklings that it  took over it's this new mom yeah so i
KcF2KP0zgM0,10298880,10305279,like the graphics like a lot of people  love this kind of art style um and it  seems to be a massive time sink um you
KcF2KP0zgM0,10305279,10310479,know for people that are wanting that um  it looks fun i see railroads i see rake
KcF2KP0zgM0,10310479,10316080,lakes i see rivers and  farming  there you go lots of fun lots of farming
KcF2KP0zgM0,10316080,10322720,that's right it's like yeah and they  even said they're like yeah level up  useless skills  okay good you know i like that you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,10322720,10327840,there's no uh no wool bullying pulled  over our eyes you know it's just right  direct we're gonna tell you this is what
KcF2KP0zgM0,10327840,10334160,it is yeah and uh i think people  appreciate that it's good
KcF2KP0zgM0,10334160,10341438,yeah anyway  [Laughter]  i'm just talking
KcF2KP0zgM0,10342160,10347920,i think i mean i can do this all day i  talk about these games all day that's  all i do

KcF2KP0zgM0,11290160,11296720,ladies and gentlemen i am very excited  to introduce notorious  [Music]
KcF2KP0zgM0,11296720,11304080,hi i'm chris i'm cole and i'm john and  this is notorious studios we're a small  game company that started last year and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11304080,11310560,we're trying to make a game what game we  making jon i don't know i don't know  what our game is
KcF2KP0zgM0,11312080,11317439,project honor is a class-based online  action rpg where you can go on  adventures with your friends or on your
KcF2KP0zgM0,11317439,11323439,own to get loot and resources to gear  out your character the game is still  really really early and we're still
KcF2KP0zgM0,11323439,11328720,trying to figure a lot of things out but  really the guiding star for us is class
KcF2KP0zgM0,11328720,11334240,fantasy  you want to sell that character and  class fantasy through every single
KcF2KP0zgM0,11334240,11339600,aspect of your gameplay how you open a  chest you know how you walk how you talk  how you interact with different
KcF2KP0zgM0,11339600,11345359,creatures and characters and stuff like  that should should be all through your  class
KcF2KP0zgM0,11345359,11351840,other than class fantasy another big  pillar for us is player stories  a big compelling thing with games these
KcF2KP0zgM0,11351840,11357359,days is just you play  an experience and then when you come out  of that experience you have like a story
KcF2KP0zgM0,11357359,11363760,of what happened something the team does  right now one of our rituals is we do  this weekly thursday play test and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11363760,11369600,we know when the game is doing well when  outside of the play test everybody is  just kind of talking about a cool story
KcF2KP0zgM0,11369600,11376000,or a moment that happened right and so  that's really kind of what we're  shooting for
KcF2KP0zgM0,11376239,11381920,the third pillar for us  is we're building a new world you know a  lot of us came from the world of
KcF2KP0zgM0,11381920,11387200,warcraft team and so we're all really  world builders you know one of the  coolest things about starting in the
KcF2KP0zgM0,11387200,11393359,studio was starting everything like  literally even just the world starting  from nothing and working in ue5 has
KcF2KP0zgM0,11393359,11401200,really opened up to a lot of really cool  opportunities for us to block out spaces  of large scale and small scale allows us
KcF2KP0zgM0,11401200,11407439,to kind of just try something and just  no that doesn't work throw it away let's  try this oh that felt really cool cool
KcF2KP0zgM0,11407439,11412640,let's keep that let's take little  snippets and nuggets  that we like and then carry that stuff
KcF2KP0zgM0,11412640,11418720,forward as we kind of  mature the space or mature an area we  want our world to feel like its own
KcF2KP0zgM0,11418720,11424479,character  we want you to you know explore it and  learn about it

KcF2KP0zgM0,11476239,11483520,now for those that don't know notorious  started approximately one year ago a  collective of former blizzard amazon
KcF2KP0zgM0,11483520,11489359,games and other developers got together  for the goal to create a brand new high
KcF2KP0zgM0,11489359,11495040,fantasy  virtual world experience and as a long  time gamer and world of warcraft player
KcF2KP0zgM0,11495040,11502479,myself i could not be more excited to  work side by side with chris kaliki and  the team to help deliver what we believe
KcF2KP0zgM0,11502479,11509200,to be the future of high fantasy open  world games  so the partnership between notorious and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11509200,11514640,otk starts a little over a year ago when  chris galicki hit me up on discord
KcF2KP0zgM0,11514640,11520720,wanted to talk to me a little bit about  this new project he was working on now  chris galicki if you guys don't know
KcF2KP0zgM0,11520720,11526479,created the monk class in world of  warcraft long time class designer on wow  he's been there you know for years and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11526479,11531680,years and years and as somebody that  really enjoys playing brewmaster monk i  thought it was a tremendous opportunity
KcF2KP0zgM0,11531680,11537040,to get to meet chris learn more about  his project and really just pay homage  to somebody that's helped you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,11537040,11543920,create some awesome experiences in my  life playing games we're longtime  mmorpg players we're longtime high
KcF2KP0zgM0,11543920,11550880,fantasy enjoyers and what really makes  notorious special in our eyes is their  origins as their humble beginnings as
KcF2KP0zgM0,11550880,11556239,originally an mmorpg guild full of  friends cohorts people that enjoyed
KcF2KP0zgM0,11556239,11562960,spending time together and over time  decided they want to work together  sounds a lot like otk
KcF2KP0zgM0,11562960,11568800,so from their beginnings it was clear  that there was a lot of alignment  between our organization and notorious
KcF2KP0zgM0,11568800,11575040,and the more and more we talked about  their game their design philosophies  their intention for their studio the
KcF2KP0zgM0,11575040,11581319,more we realized that this is something  we really want to be a part of and  support
KcF2KP0zgM0,11591600,11598880,i can't believe it it's finally time  chris welcome welcome to the show
KcF2KP0zgM0,11598960,11605200,i i am just so astonished like we were  you know you guys came down to austin  like maybe six months ago and we just
KcF2KP0zgM0,11605200,11610640,started talking about this and getting  into it and i remember like we stayed  until the place we went to like they
KcF2KP0zgM0,11610640,11618160,kicked us out  yeah yeah i am so excited so yes this is  chris kaliki here with me from notorious
KcF2KP0zgM0,11618160,11623920,studios and we are going to be talking  about the game that they've been  creating over the past about year or so
KcF2KP0zgM0,11623920,11630720,yes yeah yeah um thanks for having me  and man this is this is really i mean  this is epic man like this is like
KcF2KP0zgM0,11630720,11636239,really cool and it's crazy right and you  know i come from a triple a background a  lot of people from our team come from a
KcF2KP0zgM0,11636239,11642000,triple a background but  you know now that we're indeed  developers i know like how hard it is to
KcF2KP0zgM0,11642000,11647920,make a game from scratch and then also  you know how much work goes into like  the announcements and trailers and all
KcF2KP0zgM0,11647920,11654640,that and you know everybody here all the  other games i saw today were just so  awesome and i'm just you know jealous
KcF2KP0zgM0,11654640,11660479,for our moment of when we can show  actual gameplay footage of the game and  um you know i just want to stress about
KcF2KP0zgM0,11660479,11667200,how early it is and get this development  of the of the game you know it's kind of  unusual for a studio to
KcF2KP0zgM0,11667200,11673680,um i think  you know show concept art and show uh  you know talk about the game this early
KcF2KP0zgM0,11673680,11679760,just because you know if uh you could  just set expectations just so so high or
KcF2KP0zgM0,11679760,11686560,whatever but you know a lot of us from  the team and me especially just kind of  see the the value in involving the
KcF2KP0zgM0,11686560,11692160,player and the game development process  or and and that's you know you guys and  other influencers that i've talked
KcF2KP0zgM0,11692160,11697520,through and interacted with through the  years has been kind of my way to like  connect to the player and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11697520,11705040,and uh you know the best games on  discord yeah exactly yeah so the best  the best uh games i think are uh involve
KcF2KP0zgM0,11705040,11710560,the player throughout its whole  development process so we're trying some  new things here trying to being you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,11710560,11717680,going out there and being risky and kind  of showing some of the stuff early but  uh yeah yeah i mean i i'm sure s fanned
KcF2KP0zgM0,11717680,11722960,and and tips you all went out to the uh  the studio yourselves and you got a  chance to take a look around what do you
KcF2KP0zgM0,11722960,11729600,think  how do you feel i i thought it was  absolutely incredible i mean just just  getting the chance to go out there and i
KcF2KP0zgM0,11729600,11735920,mean tip said it you know in the video  we're fantasy enjoyers right and we're  all everybody said that hey we're
KcF2KP0zgM0,11735920,11742239,enjoyers that's what it is and uh we're  all cut from the same cloth and really  from the first time we met and uh i mean
KcF2KP0zgM0,11742239,11748720,you you made a video uh really before  notorious and everything got started  maybe maybe publicly yeah yeah husband
KcF2KP0zgM0,11748720,11754560,reacted to it  but uh i remember watching that video  and i was like this this guy gets it and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11754560,11761359,and it's not just you but it's it it's a  whole um it's the whole culture and  notorious it's all the same
KcF2KP0zgM0,11761359,11767520,and uh it was a perfect fit it's  exciting to see that you guys are uh  looking at games the same way that we
KcF2KP0zgM0,11767520,11773439,look at games the same way that a lot of  people look at games and um  i uh i mean just getting to playtest the
KcF2KP0zgM0,11773439,11779600,game a little bit was an incredible  experience even though it's you know  it's it's just in the beginnings it's  already uh it already has a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,11779600,11785040,promise so i'm very excited about that  yeah i mean you're there doing what i  talked about in the videos like our
KcF2KP0zgM0,11785040,11791600,weekly ritual play testing the game and  giving feedback and and yeah i'm really  happy that you and rich were able to be
KcF2KP0zgM0,11791600,11797040,a part of that yeah yeah well it was  funny we went and i don't remember how  long we play tested exactly maybe maybe
KcF2KP0zgM0,11797040,11802640,it was like an hour or so maybe maybe a  couple hours i don't remember but we  play tested for maybe an hour or two and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11802640,11807680,we sat there and talked i think for four  hours  just just talking to everybody on the
KcF2KP0zgM0,11807680,11814239,team and just hearing what people's uh  vision was and gaming in general and  just how people look at games is
KcF2KP0zgM0,11814239,11819439,it was the one of the most fun  experiences i've had and it was supposed  to be working so i don't know maybe i
KcF2KP0zgM0,11819439,11825040,was cheating it a little bit but it was  a lot of fun getting getting to playtest  the warrior and stuff too
KcF2KP0zgM0,11825040,11831359,yeah yeah uh yeah i know we afterwards  we just had like really long several  hour conversations and you had a flight
KcF2KP0zgM0,11831359,11837600,to catch but i know rich he stayed alone  stayed around longer and you know we had  dinner and man we can just keep going
KcF2KP0zgM0,11837600,11843120,and go i don't know how rich can just  keep talking that  that much it's just insane so yeah but
KcF2KP0zgM0,11843120,11849200,uh yeah so much good feedback and it  really energized our team  you know  one of the things that we loved about
KcF2KP0zgM0,11849200,11855680,game development is you know we work on  a lot we have worked on a live game for  a large part of our careers and be able
KcF2KP0zgM0,11855680,11861120,to like get stuff out there and get  feedback it just energizes us and gets  us you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,11861120,11866720,gets us going so and we appreciate it  you know we're not we're not we're not  always used to developers opening up
KcF2KP0zgM0,11866720,11872399,their doors and working side by side  with uh content creators to you know  give collaboration and feedback and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11872399,11878000,stuff like that and so just to  re-emphasize guys we have officially  partnered up with notorious studios
KcF2KP0zgM0,11878000,11883120,we're going to be helping them  collaborating with them giving feedback  on their new open world rpg game that
KcF2KP0zgM0,11883120,11888399,they are currently working on we're  super excited you know the second we  heard about their philosophy when it
KcF2KP0zgM0,11888399,11895760,came to class design how they wanted the  world to be you know a main character  and so on and so forth it just  completely struck a chord with us 100
KcF2KP0zgM0,11895760,11901840,and so i just want to say thank you to  chris and the rest of the team at  notorious we look forward to uh helping
KcF2KP0zgM0,11901840,11907920,usher in the next generation of high  fantasy and doing what we can to provide  as much feedback as we can you want to
KcF2KP0zgM0,11907920,11913840,talk a little bit about the game like  kind of what it is what it's not  anything like that  uh yeah i mean we talked a little bit
KcF2KP0zgM0,11913840,11919760,about it in the video i think it's  challenging to talk specifics about what  the game is because it's every a lot of
KcF2KP0zgM0,11919760,11926319,things are in flux and you know we kind  of view it as a new genre and it's kind  of but some of the elements in the game
KcF2KP0zgM0,11926319,11933359,like we talked about in the game is you  know i i've worked most of my career as  a class designer and i love the rpg
KcF2KP0zgM0,11933359,11940239,classes i think it's just part of our  zeitgeist part of the culture you know  there's like an elf emoji and all of
KcF2KP0zgM0,11940239,11946399,this and so it's like we're trying to  take all those ideas of all these  different classes and that's really what
KcF2KP0zgM0,11946399,11952080,the the the heart of the game is is  trying to think of you know what is the  ultimate fantasy of a warrior of a
KcF2KP0zgM0,11952080,11958080,priest of of um trying to make sure okay  you know and uh and everything comes
KcF2KP0zgM0,11958080,11963439,around from that and so you know  everything springs from that and so how  they interact with the world how they
KcF2KP0zgM0,11963439,11969920,interact with each other um making sure  they have very distinct differences and  so a mage won't play like a warrior and
KcF2KP0zgM0,11969920,11976319,a warrior won't play like a priest and  so um yeah and you know we're spending a  lot of work on
KcF2KP0zgM0,11976319,11982000,you know making the different characters  you know base essentially the classes  are like a character in our game and so
KcF2KP0zgM0,11982000,11987840,they have their own kind of character  model their own kind of aesthetic their  own gear their own look and so it's not
KcF2KP0zgM0,11987840,11994960,something shared between them and so um  you know it's expensive to do all that  but we really think that um you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,11994960,12001120,we're always looking for a game that the  head that makes us feel more like the  class that we um resonate with i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,12001120,12007520,we all kind of play rpgs and have a  class that we always try to play in  every refugee and um
KcF2KP0zgM0,12007520,12013600,and so yeah we're trying to like take  that core idea and just drive it to its  ultimate right yeah for sure
KcF2KP0zgM0,12013600,12019840,i mean  and you can stop me if i start saying  too much but uh i 100 felt that way and
KcF2KP0zgM0,12019840,12026319,uh i mean we we all have it right like  asman is is the warrior guy right i play  a paladin um i got to play test the
KcF2KP0zgM0,12026319,12031760,warrior like i said earlier and uh just  getting a chance i don't know if i was  talking to john or cole about this but
KcF2KP0zgM0,12031760,12038640,um  exactly what you said i wanted to when  i'm playing a warrior i want to feel  like i'm playing a warrior whether it's
KcF2KP0zgM0,12038640,12045600,the gear that i'm wearing the buttons  i'm pressing uh what the abilities do  and uh having that degree of tactility
KcF2KP0zgM0,12045600,12052080,right that degree of tactical  tactility from whenever i press a button  and i um
KcF2KP0zgM0,12052080,12058160,it was the ball and chain skill can i  talk about this a little bit yes yeah go  go for it yeah so so there's a and
KcF2KP0zgM0,12058160,12064880,everything is is working this is going  to be a three minute thing probably  right uh like 35 30 45 seconds
KcF2KP0zgM0,12064880,12071040,are you sure  50.  okay so there's an ability right with a  ball and chain where you essentially
KcF2KP0zgM0,12071040,12077120,throw out the chain you hit the guy and  you pull him back and having that sort  of feeling of uh i'm throwing out a
KcF2KP0zgM0,12077120,12083520,heavy ball of metal on a chain and it  hits that guy and sort of like boom oh  what the heck just happened and you get
KcF2KP0zgM0,12083520,12089520,ripped forward having that sort of  feeling in the game and the player  experiencing that is uh is a huge thing
KcF2KP0zgM0,12089520,12096560,and uh it really just harkens on what  you were saying about feeling like  you're playing the class that you're  playing so i i i love it it's awesome
KcF2KP0zgM0,12096560,12102560,and yeah and like with the warrior right  we kind of view him as just like a  walking weapon like he uses his body as
KcF2KP0zgM0,12102560,12109279,a weapon and so a lot of um it allows  for a lot of like different kind of  experiences and abilities to spring and
KcF2KP0zgM0,12109279,12115040,build off of that concept it's awesome  so the one you're talking about here and  we're putting typing many different
KcF2KP0zgM0,12115040,12121600,abilities and spells and that's like one  of my favorite things to do in game  design is come up with abilities and  spells and so uh one that we just have
KcF2KP0zgM0,12121600,12127120,for the warriors he just um you know  grips you like like you said that we're  just playing around with and it allows
KcF2KP0zgM0,12127120,12132239,for a lot of interesting moments of uh  in in game play that creates like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12132239,12137920,different stories that come out of the  match and that sort of thing i think i  like that a lot especially you know like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12137920,12144399,what what is my aesthetic of a character  it's like a big  badass warrior with a massive two-handed
KcF2KP0zgM0,12144399,12150000,sword or some sort of massive weapon and  like especially like the you know like  using your body as a weapon and just
KcF2KP0zgM0,12150000,12156399,like knocking things around like the  very impactful and forceful gameplay of  it i think that's something that a lot
KcF2KP0zgM0,12156399,12161680,of people feel many mmos have kind of  lost right because you have the  homogenization you have things become
KcF2KP0zgM0,12161680,12170720,closer and closer to themselves and you  forget about like what makes each class  special and unique and more themselves
KcF2KP0zgM0,12170720,12176000,no totally and i think the other aspect  as well is just
KcF2KP0zgM0,12176000,12181920,you know heightening immersion where we  can about making you feel like  that class and how you interact with the
KcF2KP0zgM0,12181920,12186960,world and creating different aspects in  the world that you know there could be  an area that only the place can go
KcF2KP0zgM0,12186960,12194080,through and warriors can't because they  just can't fit through it or things like  that right and so we're playing with the  round with a lot of different um a lot
KcF2KP0zgM0,12194080,12201040,of different ideas that come from that  kind of pillar i guess  well hey guys if you guys did not know
KcF2KP0zgM0,12201040,12207120,already  notorious is also currently hiring  they're looking to build up their team  this is just the beginning of what we

KcF2KP0zgM0,12262239,12267520,what you were doing minecraft next week  i guess i guess it's been a year  probably in the making isn't it yes yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,12267520,12273520,oh my god a lot of talk about right and  and what do you what do you feel like  this partnership means because we  haven't really had a lot of game
KcF2KP0zgM0,12273520,12279359,development studios really sit down and  work directly with influencers and so  how do you really expect to see that
KcF2KP0zgM0,12279359,12285279,progress and evolve  i think that's a great question i think  a lot of this we're on the front lines
KcF2KP0zgM0,12285279,12291760,of this kind of experience and trying to  figure out like what that even means  i think as you know tips was saying
KcF2KP0zgM0,12291760,12298319,earlier i think a big part of it is  having you guys as a resource to bounce  ideas i mean i would have done that  anyways if we didn't partner i'd be like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12298319,12304239,hey what do you think about this uh  ability or this concept or whatever um  so certainly that's sort of like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12304239,12310720,advisorship is definitely i think really  important and then also being able to  reach our target audience which i think
KcF2KP0zgM0,12310720,12317120,your audience and our audience is going  to be so similar and so i think that's  going to be a big part of this and um
KcF2KP0zgM0,12317120,12323439,yeah like you mentioned you don't see a  lot of studios kind of talk about the  concept of the game this early and then
KcF2KP0zgM0,12323439,12328720,um you know  go through the development journey  uh in the open and so i think that could
KcF2KP0zgM0,12328720,12334800,be some cool opportunities for us to  collaborate you know we've only talked  about three classes today and we want to
KcF2KP0zgM0,12334800,12340960,have you know more classes in the game  we may unveil those later on and so we  could do that you know on stream or
KcF2KP0zgM0,12340960,12346319,something or like i like that i've  always thought it would be awesome to  have like a jam session with
KcF2KP0zgM0,12346319,12352000,uh the community like let's brainstorm  abilities i don't know we could like  figure some cool stuff out i think oh i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12352000,12358399,i thought like you know making sub  classes for a warrior you know what are  the subclasses like a a barbarian a
KcF2KP0zgM0,12358399,12364319,gladiator a spartan or like you know a  long swordsman or something like that so  like yeah especially getting together
KcF2KP0zgM0,12364319,12369520,and like being super creative like that  i think people absolutely love that and  before we go any further i do want to
KcF2KP0zgM0,12369520,12377359,remind everybody this is your last  chance to vote for the best games and  this is going to be again a 50 000 grant
KcF2KP0zgM0,12377359,12383040,for these games are the winners make  sure to go to the otk network discord  and you guys can vote on those games and
KcF2KP0zgM0,12383040,12389200,we'll be announcing the winners uh in  just a little bit here but i  just wanted to make sure yeah there's
KcF2KP0zgM0,12389200,12396239,only one minute there's only literally  one minute left 60 seconds so yeah 60.  well now it's 58. and so yeah make sure
KcF2KP0zgM0,12396239,12401439,you guys vote on that real quick and um  i just am so i'm so excited because i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12401439,12409040,remember whenever uh we met up with you  guys and like cole showed me some of the  artwork  and i was just like oh my god
KcF2KP0zgM0,12409040,12415040,finally you know i was so happy yeah i  think cole even like drew you like he  was in a hotel lobby i was like what are
KcF2KP0zgM0,12415040,12422000,you sketching and he made like an image  of you yeah i think that was just an  undead yeah it was like an undead asthma
KcF2KP0zgM0,12422000,12427760,yeah so it's just asthma gold yeah yeah  yeah that's about right  okay yeah i mean i am just i'm so
KcF2KP0zgM0,12427760,12432960,excited and just the whole thing about  it is really cool like what we've talked  about with the game and where things are
KcF2KP0zgM0,12432960,12440080,going and i hope this really is the  future of game development because more  so  we see more studios uh you know the
KcF2KP0zgM0,12440080,12445600,separation between the community and the  developer sometimes becomes even larger  with like social media and people trying
KcF2KP0zgM0,12445600,12450960,to avoid  you know realistically like some of the  more vitriolic people but it's really
KcF2KP0zgM0,12450960,12456880,admirable and impressive to see people  like you and your team sit down and  actually try to talk with people and
KcF2KP0zgM0,12456880,12462399,give them an audience and really involve  them in the whole process  yeah and i think a big thing we like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12462399,12467680,about you know influencers or otk is  just you guys are all about authenticity
KcF2KP0zgM0,12467680,12473760,and you're going to say what you really  believe and that's how we are and that's  how we operate in the studio and um so
KcF2KP0zgM0,12473760,12478960,yeah i mean even though you know we call  this a partnership and that sort of  thing i want to hear like the truth i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12478960,12485680,want to hear like what you really think  you know i don't need you know i'm not  looking for shills or anything like that  and so i think both ways right and so i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12485680,12492960,think all about authenticity all about  kind of like how we really feel and  yeah so the best games the best the best
KcF2KP0zgM0,12492960,12499840,ideas come out of that i think that's  the best way to make a game right is  whenever you're able to actually give  legitimate real feedback rather than you
KcF2KP0zgM0,12499840,12506000,know just kind of telling people what  they want to hear and i think that's  definitely been kind of a problem with  game development over time and so i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12506000,12512239,think this is absolutely a brush breath  of fresh air yeah this is turning into  the all craft already
KcF2KP0zgM0,12512239,12518720,here's the thing like  they've been telling me like all right  all right stop i just can't stop there's  like a million things that i want to say
KcF2KP0zgM0,12518720,12525439,we'll talk about more about this on all  craft chris caliki from notorious gaming  thank you so much for coming on thank

KcF2KP0zgM0,12747600,12752800,and uh we actually play tested it too  yeah i already was kind of alluding to
KcF2KP0zgM0,12752800,12759600,the fact that some of the people working  on it made some of my favorite board  games yeah arkham horror which is a  narrative strategy that i was super into
KcF2KP0zgM0,12759600,12765040,so i was we had talked like for anybody  who doesn't know we had actually talked  to the development team and not just

KcF2KP0zgM0,12770560,12777600,they've got some real pedigree they know  what they're doing with these board  games and i straight up and i actually  try it out that's a stack team oh yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,12777600,12784239,absolutely this is uh s tier team so  i haven't done a lot of board games  pretty much like ever since i was
KcF2KP0zgM0,12784239,12790880,stealing monopoly money from my friends  and we just stopped playing monopoly  because we couldn't stop stealing each  other's money i have a board game night

KcF2KP0zgM0,12796840,12803520,course i love shroud yeah i mean there  are just so many games that i i i feel  like they were
KcF2KP0zgM0,12803520,12811600,they were really really fun like oh my  god i forgot about this one the racing  game neodash yes oh my god like i i just
KcF2KP0zgM0,12811600,12816800,i cannot wait to play that like that  that is the kind of game that you just  play on stream for three hours
KcF2KP0zgM0,12816800,12822640,accidentally yeah the other game that  looked really good as a stream game was  yeah  because you know bennett foddy made a
KcF2KP0zgM0,12822640,12828160,lot of those games like quack and then  he also made getting over it looks like  it's in that vein i can see you guys
KcF2KP0zgM0,12828160,12833840,yeah i can't wait to play that game  while i can't move my i'm walking like  this you know like i'm gonna fall off
KcF2KP0zgM0,12833840,12839920,the edge and everybody gonna laugh at me  i'll have to like take a day off a  stream write a twit longer do the whole
KcF2KP0zgM0,12839920,12846319,thing yeah i know it's gonna be great  dude the other one uh that it was the  first game that was announced that i was
KcF2KP0zgM0,12846319,12851920,super into was knights of the deep the  crab game crab game yeah
KcF2KP0zgM0,12851920,12856960,i i thought this was like this is the  kind of game that i could 100
KcF2KP0zgM0,12856960,12862399,percent see us playing on otk game night  or something like that i feel like this  is like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12862399,12869040,this is the potential to be sodapoppin's  main game for like a year i i could see  that absolutely and it's like
KcF2KP0zgM0,12869040,12875680,the thing with this game is it's just  i mean bruh  it's so ridiculous that it's good that's
KcF2KP0zgM0,12875680,12881760,what i like about it the most the  flamethrower with the lobster yeah  it's perfect i wonder like what happens
KcF2KP0zgM0,12881760,12887359,whenever you kill one of them like i  hope whenever like you you kill one of  the lobsters they like explode you know
KcF2KP0zgM0,12887359,12893279,just like kind of pop yeah yeah or or  they they they turned into like uh you  know i can wow whenever you kill a
KcF2KP0zgM0,12893279,12898880,turkey it turns into like a cooked  turkey yeah turn to a lobster yeah you  you kill him it turns into him until it
KcF2KP0zgM0,12898880,12904000,turns him into a lobster dinner i feel  like i  didn't see as much crab gameplay as
KcF2KP0zgM0,12904000,12911520,lobster gameplay which kind of upset me  um maybe these guys played a little bit  too much album ring true any lobsters
KcF2KP0zgM0,12911520,12918720,those this is this is getting into like  uh-huh i could get really nerdy right  now crabs are just they're more  efficient movers than lobster i
KcF2KP0zgM0,12918720,12925840,i don't really know about that i mean  every time i've watched like a nature  video it's always the crab that gets
KcF2KP0zgM0,12925840,12931040,eaten  every single every single time it's  always the crab that gets god
KcF2KP0zgM0,12931040,12937040,that's not true that's pretty much is  true like let's be honest  it is and like yeah i really like this
KcF2KP0zgM0,12937040,12945520,game a lot but again like i just there  have been so many and that uh ethereal  game yep uh the mmo like that was like

KcF2KP0zgM0,13036479,13041760,game like there is no way that's not  what happened like that was a survival
KcF2KP0zgM0,13041760,13047359,medieval game so basically like it's  it's like rust with swords you know and
KcF2KP0zgM0,13047359,13054000,i like i think what really sold me on  that game was whenever they had the  whole siege happening and they brought
KcF2KP0zgM0,13054000,13061600,in like a you know like a siege engine  and they were talking about trebuchets  as well like i am just so so excited to
KcF2KP0zgM0,13061600,13067680,see where that game goes i saw people  talking about in chat long after we  actually looked at it and we got to deep
KcF2KP0zgM0,13067680,13073520,dive that game quite a bit as well it  definitely looks like one i'm not  surprised at all that it managed to grab
