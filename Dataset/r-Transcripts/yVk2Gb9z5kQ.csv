yVk2Gb9z5kQ,8720,11920,so violently and so perplexing  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,13200,16000,that if the truth were told all of us  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,16720,20720,have had moments that we wanted to throw up our hands

yVk2Gb9z5kQ,54560,59440,"See, life is 10% what happens to you it's 90% what you do about it.  "
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,59440,62800,Everything you see that's beautiful starts out as a seed  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,62800,66800,"but that seed got to get dirt on it. See, you get tripped out  "
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,66800,70400,'cause you got dirt on you but you need dirt on you to develop.

yVk2Gb9z5kQ,90240,92560,You get mad because you get a detour.  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,92560,96640,That's just dirt. You get mad because they talking about you.  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,96640,100880,That's dirt. You get mad because you lost your mama.  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,100880,103920,That's dirt. But show me something  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,104640,109200,that has grown into something beautiful that didn't have no dirt on it.  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,109200,114079,You got to have dirt on you to grow into what god got for you.

yVk2Gb9z5kQ,143120,147200,and if I'm planning in it expect me to come back up again.  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,147200,150319,And when I come back up you won't recognize me  
yVk2Gb9z5kQ,150880,156720,because I've got to be transformed by the experiences that I have endured.
