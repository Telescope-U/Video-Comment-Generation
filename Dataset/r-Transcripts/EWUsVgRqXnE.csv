EWUsVgRqXnE,9440,12000,performance trim for their midsize sedan
EWUsVgRqXnE,12000,15759,this is a 2021 toyota camry trd but
EWUsVgRqXnE,15759,18880,before we get into this four-door sports
EWUsVgRqXnE,18880,20560,sedan let's talk about what's going on
EWUsVgRqXnE,20560,23279,here the mid-sized segment of the auto
EWUsVgRqXnE,23279,25439,industry is still on fire even though
EWUsVgRqXnE,25439,27359,some big-name players have left the
EWUsVgRqXnE,27359,29760,party there's brands like toyota that
EWUsVgRqXnE,29760,32078,still think that it's smart to produce
EWUsVgRqXnE,32078,34800,these sedans because people want to buy
EWUsVgRqXnE,34800,37920,them now toyota being that iconic
EWUsVgRqXnE,37920,40559,japanese brand they want to up the annie
EWUsVgRqXnE,40559,43200,and bring some performance and extra
EWUsVgRqXnE,43200,45520,style to the camry
EWUsVgRqXnE,45520,47760,in this camry trd now there's many
EWUsVgRqXnE,47760,49360,choices you could go if you're looking
EWUsVgRqXnE,49360,52320,at a midsize sport sedan in this price
EWUsVgRqXnE,52320,54640,segment you could go honda accord sport
EWUsVgRqXnE,54640,56079,with the two liter turbo that's the
EWUsVgRqXnE,56079,58719,detuned type r engine you could even pay
EWUsVgRqXnE,58719,61039,a little bit more and go accord touring
EWUsVgRqXnE,61039,62640,that's going to get you not only the d2
EWUsVgRqXnE,62640,64960,and type r motor but it's also going to
EWUsVgRqXnE,64960,66720,get you adaptive dampers you could
EWUsVgRqXnE,66720,69760,always go with like a mazda 6 turbo
EWUsVgRqXnE,69760,71439,get the carbon edition like we featured
EWUsVgRqXnE,71439,74080,here on radius rides or the new hyundai
EWUsVgRqXnE,74080,77759,sonata n-line or the kia k5 gt
EWUsVgRqXnE,77759,79280,i'm even going to throw in there just
EWUsVgRqXnE,79280,82240,for fun the subaru wrx even though
EWUsVgRqXnE,82240,85200,that's not a mid-size price point falls
EWUsVgRqXnE,85200,86640,in alignment with all those other
EWUsVgRqXnE,86640,89280,vehicles so what i want to find out has
EWUsVgRqXnE,89280,91520,toyota done enough to really make this
EWUsVgRqXnE,91520,94000,truly a sport performance sedan
EWUsVgRqXnE,94000,96079,and is this the one to get
EWUsVgRqXnE,96079,98880,over all of those competitors let's dive
EWUsVgRqXnE,98880,101759,into this camry trd and find out right
EWUsVgRqXnE,101759,105040,off the bat you got this black metallic
EWUsVgRqXnE,105040,107920,color to it it's got a blue tinge to the
EWUsVgRqXnE,107920,109840,the metal flake it reminds me of a
EWUsVgRqXnE,109840,112399,bowling ball or a bass fishing boat so
EWUsVgRqXnE,112399,113920,if you like that style you're definitely
EWUsVgRqXnE,113920,116079,going to like this camry trd starting at
EWUsVgRqXnE,116079,117600,the front of the business you are
EWUsVgRqXnE,117600,119520,getting led lighting and that seems to
EWUsVgRqXnE,119520,122000,be the flavor of all the different
EWUsVgRqXnE,122000,123840,brands that at this price point in the
EWUsVgRqXnE,123840,125439,mid-size sedan segment you're going to
EWUsVgRqXnE,125439,127280,get led headlights you can see your
EWUsVgRqXnE,127280,129520,daytime running lamps i do like the size
EWUsVgRqXnE,129520,131760,of the headlight housing nothing too big
EWUsVgRqXnE,131760,134560,nice long angular cut into the front
EWUsVgRqXnE,134560,136879,fascia area and that's one thing that
EWUsVgRqXnE,136879,138879,with the camry trd you're getting
EWUsVgRqXnE,138879,141200,totally different front fascia than your
EWUsVgRqXnE,141200,143840,standard camry which is great the bad
EWUsVgRqXnE,143840,145520,news is we're going to have to just drop
EWUsVgRqXnE,145520,147920,a big zonk right in this corner they
EWUsVgRqXnE,147920,149440,could have done anything else but what
EWUsVgRqXnE,149440,151200,they did was they made this fake vent
EWUsVgRqXnE,151200,153280,this could have been housing for fog
EWUsVgRqXnE,153280,154959,lamps this could have been a functional
EWUsVgRqXnE,154959,157519,side air curtain or god forbid bring
EWUsVgRqXnE,157519,159680,extra air to the radiator or the brakes
EWUsVgRqXnE,159680,162319,but what i do love is look at the split
EWUsVgRqXnE,162319,163280,level
EWUsVgRqXnE,163280,166000,of the front lip spoiler i think that it
EWUsVgRqXnE,166000,168080,really fits the aggressive lines that
EWUsVgRqXnE,168080,170879,they're going for plus this is a fully
EWUsVgRqXnE,170879,172879,functional piece it's not just stuck on
EWUsVgRqXnE,172879,174879,with double-sided tape or bubble gum
EWUsVgRqXnE,174879,176319,they actually tested this in a wind
EWUsVgRqXnE,176319,177920,tunnel to give you a little bit more
EWUsVgRqXnE,177920,180400,down force because performance is going
EWUsVgRqXnE,180400,182000,to come in a different flavor that maybe
EWUsVgRqXnE,182000,184400,you're not used to now as we come across
EWUsVgRqXnE,184400,186159,the front grill area
EWUsVgRqXnE,186159,188000,with this generation of the camry they
EWUsVgRqXnE,188000,190000,definitely stopped it from looking like
EWUsVgRqXnE,190000,191200,a refrigerator if you look at the
EWUsVgRqXnE,191200,192959,previous generation it was looking
EWUsVgRqXnE,192959,195519,pretty bland this camry though very very
EWUsVgRqXnE,195519,198080,aggressive you have this functional
EWUsVgRqXnE,198080,200480,grill area up top with it being this
EWUsVgRqXnE,200480,202720,metallic black the gloss black all
EWUsVgRqXnE,202720,205200,blends in very nicely and then a large
EWUsVgRqXnE,205200,207840,massive opening on the lower grill you
EWUsVgRqXnE,207840,209680,can see that front lip splitter
EWUsVgRqXnE,209680,212000,extending out with that nice sparkle to
EWUsVgRqXnE,212000,214239,it and then of course with the way the
EWUsVgRqXnE,214239,216959,hood is it really waterfalls nicely into
EWUsVgRqXnE,216959,218720,that front fascia now when we get up
EWUsVgRqXnE,218720,220560,onto the hood you'll notice you've got
EWUsVgRqXnE,220560,222400,some interesting body lines we have some
EWUsVgRqXnE,222400,223440,rises
EWUsVgRqXnE,223440,225040,on each side that go into the eight
EWUsVgRqXnE,225040,226879,pillar and then they'll take the body
EWUsVgRqXnE,226879,229280,lines off of the front fascia
EWUsVgRqXnE,229280,231280,run it into the hood and then let it
EWUsVgRqXnE,231280,234000,curve off and just disappear so very
EWUsVgRqXnE,234000,235519,very aggressive and when you compare
EWUsVgRqXnE,235519,237360,this to the competition i think
EWUsVgRqXnE,237360,239280,definitely hands down much more
EWUsVgRqXnE,239280,241280,aggressive than the accord much more
EWUsVgRqXnE,241280,243280,aggressive than the mazda6
EWUsVgRqXnE,243280,245280,i still think that the sonata end line
EWUsVgRqXnE,245280,248000,and definitely the kia k5 gt is bringing
EWUsVgRqXnE,248000,249519,some extra aggression but let's see what
EWUsVgRqXnE,249519,251519,else we have as we come around the bend
EWUsVgRqXnE,251519,254080,you'll notice that bodywork like i said
EWUsVgRqXnE,254080,255920,it's got the red trim because it's a trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,255920,257440,and they bring it all the way around the
EWUsVgRqXnE,257440,259680,side to channel that air when you go
EWUsVgRqXnE,259680,261840,camry trd you're getting unique wheels
EWUsVgRqXnE,261840,264160,so this is a 19 inch wheel it's actually
EWUsVgRqXnE,264160,266320,lighter than your standard camry wheel
EWUsVgRqXnE,266320,268800,you can see the trd badge love the flat
EWUsVgRqXnE,268800,271199,black that sort of y spoke design going
EWUsVgRqXnE,271199,273120,on there looking really good and i
EWUsVgRqXnE,273120,274720,really really love that you're going to
EWUsVgRqXnE,274720,276880,get extra braking so it's not just about
EWUsVgRqXnE,276880,278720,performance
EWUsVgRqXnE,278720,280639,underneath the hood there's other ways
EWUsVgRqXnE,280639,282400,to get performance and that's how toyota
EWUsVgRqXnE,282400,284000,did this camry trd they're giving you
EWUsVgRqXnE,284000,286080,bigger brakes an inch larger so you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,286080,288400,looking at 13-inch rotors you're gonna
EWUsVgRqXnE,288400,292320,have increased brake pads calipers and
EWUsVgRqXnE,292320,293680,you're getting your lowering springs
EWUsVgRqXnE,293680,296080,this camry actually sits almost an inch
EWUsVgRqXnE,296080,297840,lower than your standard camry those are
EWUsVgRqXnE,297840,300720,trd springs they're going to beef up the
EWUsVgRqXnE,300720,303919,uh anti roll bars and the anti sway bars
EWUsVgRqXnE,303919,305199,and you're going to get some extra
EWUsVgRqXnE,305199,307600,bracing to really give you that direct
EWUsVgRqXnE,307600,310160,connected driving experience this is
EWUsVgRqXnE,310160,312320,very unique this is something that you
EWUsVgRqXnE,312320,314320,don't necessarily get from the
EWUsVgRqXnE,314320,316880,competition now as we go down the side
EWUsVgRqXnE,316880,318479,you'll notice color match on the mirror
EWUsVgRqXnE,318479,320320,caps a little bit of chrome i don't know
EWUsVgRqXnE,320320,321919,why they didn't just black that out so i
EWUsVgRqXnE,321919,323600,am going to zonk it but i do like the
EWUsVgRqXnE,323600,325680,way they have those led turn signals in
EWUsVgRqXnE,325680,328000,there no sunroof to speak of so if
EWUsVgRqXnE,328000,329840,you're hoping for a sunroof you're not
EWUsVgRqXnE,329840,331759,getting it with the camry trd but what
EWUsVgRqXnE,331759,333520,you are getting is a very very
EWUsVgRqXnE,333520,335840,aggressive side sill extension
EWUsVgRqXnE,335840,337600,normally that would just be gloss black
EWUsVgRqXnE,337600,338960,but the reason why it looks color
EWUsVgRqXnE,338960,340960,matched is because we have a black camry
EWUsVgRqXnE,340960,342080,trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,342080,345039,the red trim coming towards the rear
EWUsVgRqXnE,345039,347600,love the nice line color matched on that
EWUsVgRqXnE,347600,349039,sharpie antenna
EWUsVgRqXnE,349039,352720,they even pick up the side
EWUsVgRqXnE,352720,355440,the side molding onto the actual fender
EWUsVgRqXnE,355440,357360,here channeling all that air so you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,357360,358720,not only getting the front you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,358720,360160,getting the side sills and you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,360160,362160,getting that rear area as well to
EWUsVgRqXnE,362160,364160,channel the air i am going to zonk the
EWUsVgRqXnE,364160,365680,fake vents at the back i don't know why
EWUsVgRqXnE,365680,367680,they even have that there but coming to
EWUsVgRqXnE,367680,368960,the rear what you are going to get
EWUsVgRqXnE,368960,371360,that's functional is this functional
EWUsVgRqXnE,371360,373919,rear spoiler actually very very unique
EWUsVgRqXnE,373919,375600,design something that's going to
EWUsVgRqXnE,375600,376880,definitely separate it from the
EWUsVgRqXnE,376880,379280,competition especially the way it's not
EWUsVgRqXnE,379280,381520,a pedestal style it has this dip in the
EWUsVgRqXnE,381520,383759,center and then it raises up it's got
EWUsVgRqXnE,383759,385759,your end plates looking really sharp
EWUsVgRqXnE,385759,388160,blacked out on the badging toyota and
EWUsVgRqXnE,388160,389680,camry
EWUsVgRqXnE,389680,392160,clean on the taillights nothing too
EWUsVgRqXnE,392160,394000,aggressive or too sexy nothing really to
EWUsVgRqXnE,394000,395280,talk about but of course you're gonna
EWUsVgRqXnE,395280,397600,get your trd badge and probably one of
EWUsVgRqXnE,397600,400160,the most aggressive rear diffusers
EWUsVgRqXnE,400160,402080,you've ever seen this looks like it came
EWUsVgRqXnE,402080,404160,right off of their lama winning
EWUsVgRqXnE,404160,405440,race car
EWUsVgRqXnE,405440,407759,and you're gonna have a trd cat-back
EWUsVgRqXnE,407759,409039,exhaust so the great news is you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,409039,410400,gonna actually actually get a little bit
EWUsVgRqXnE,410400,411840,better sound
EWUsVgRqXnE,411840,413360,and when we say cat-back we're not
EWUsVgRqXnE,413360,415520,talking about meow there's a exhaust
EWUsVgRqXnE,415520,417520,attached to your cat we're talking about
EWUsVgRqXnE,417520,419440,catalytic converter towards the rear of
EWUsVgRqXnE,419440,421840,the car and i like that trumpet style
EWUsVgRqXnE,421840,424479,exhaust nice stainless steel
EWUsVgRqXnE,424479,425840,looking really really aggressive but
EWUsVgRqXnE,425840,427440,when we pop the hood and see what's
EWUsVgRqXnE,427440,428800,going to be making sound out of that
EWUsVgRqXnE,428800,430560,exhaust we got the hood popped you do
EWUsVgRqXnE,430560,433120,have a prop rod i am going to zonk that
EWUsVgRqXnE,433120,434400,and it's interesting because some of the
EWUsVgRqXnE,434400,436800,competitors have prop rods and others do
EWUsVgRqXnE,436800,438880,not so one of those things just to point
EWUsVgRqXnE,438880,440800,out underneath the hood i'm also a
EWUsVgRqXnE,440800,442400,little disappointed by that engine cover
EWUsVgRqXnE,442400,444720,they could have done something
EWUsVgRqXnE,444720,446639,a little bit more since this is a camry
EWUsVgRqXnE,446639,450880,trd but what you are getting is the only
EWUsVgRqXnE,450880,453919,naturally aspirated option that is
EWUsVgRqXnE,453919,456400,available with the competition so what
EWUsVgRqXnE,456400,458880,you're looking at is a 3.5 liter
EWUsVgRqXnE,458880,461840,naturally aspirated v6 no turbocharger
EWUsVgRqXnE,461840,463680,no supercharger that's what we mean by
EWUsVgRqXnE,463680,465680,that you're getting
EWUsVgRqXnE,465680,467280,eight-speed automatic transmission
EWUsVgRqXnE,467280,469360,that's bolted to it like i said that 301
EWUsVgRqXnE,469360,472479,horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque
EWUsVgRqXnE,472479,474800,is really going to be a nice linear
EWUsVgRqXnE,474800,477120,balance of power delivery
EWUsVgRqXnE,477120,478520,the vehicle weighs
EWUsVgRqXnE,478520,483199,3572 pounds 0-60 about 5.7 seconds top
EWUsVgRqXnE,483199,487199,speed 135 miles an hour mpgs 22 in the
EWUsVgRqXnE,487199,491520,city and 31 on the highway so very very
EWUsVgRqXnE,491520,492479,unique
EWUsVgRqXnE,492479,494879,setup on how toyota is going there was
EWUsVgRqXnE,494879,496240,once upon a time that you could get a
EWUsVgRqXnE,496240,498720,trd with a supercharged v6 that would
EWUsVgRqXnE,498720,500479,have been a nice extra little touch
EWUsVgRqXnE,500479,502160,there but why don't we go ahead let's
EWUsVgRqXnE,502160,503840,fire this up because it's got a cat-back
EWUsVgRqXnE,503840,505520,exhaust and i want to hear what it
EWUsVgRqXnE,505520,507840,sounds like
EWUsVgRqXnE,523839,526080,all right guys we're in the
EWUsVgRqXnE,526080,529120,2021 camry trd we're talking about
EWUsVgRqXnE,529120,532480,what's the best mid-sized sports sedan
EWUsVgRqXnE,532480,534399,for the money in this segment

EWUsVgRqXnE,539360,542160,you are an effing genius i've been
EWUsVgRqXnE,542160,544000,thinking about this question
EWUsVgRqXnE,544000,545920,hoping that you were gonna talk about
EWUsVgRqXnE,545920,548000,this because there's so many to choose
EWUsVgRqXnE,548000,550160,from in this midsize segment
EWUsVgRqXnE,550160,552480,how much is this camry trd because you
EWUsVgRqXnE,552480,554640,definitely got me interested well if
EWUsVgRqXnE,554640,557920,you're asking i'm telling msrp is right
EWUsVgRqXnE,557920,559920,at 33 000

EWUsVgRqXnE,561519,563360,the door panel so you're gonna get soft
EWUsVgRqXnE,563360,566800,touch material the door panel in 2021 is
EWUsVgRqXnE,566800,568640,coming off a little bland now it's nice
EWUsVgRqXnE,568640,570720,with the silver trim there's a bug right
EWUsVgRqXnE,570720,572000,on the door right there but we're gonna
EWUsVgRqXnE,572000,573680,keep on going the bug's not included by

EWUsVgRqXnE,576959,578800,around the switch gear for the windows
EWUsVgRqXnE,578800,580640,and the door locks the door pocket
EWUsVgRqXnE,580640,581760,though
EWUsVgRqXnE,581760,584720,maybe three pop-tarts or toaster
EWUsVgRqXnE,584720,588560,strudels and a small
EWUsVgRqXnE,588560,589360,like
EWUsVgRqXnE,589360,590480,juice box
EWUsVgRqXnE,590480,592959,really really small or a small container
EWUsVgRqXnE,592959,595920,of milk that's about it going from the
EWUsVgRqXnE,595920,597920,door panel to the dash i do like the
EWUsVgRqXnE,597920,599920,style here this really is something that
EWUsVgRqXnE,599920,602560,separates it from the rest this
EWUsVgRqXnE,602560,605120,like gunmetal gray finish going on there
EWUsVgRqXnE,605120,607760,is a bit of this sparkly gloss black but
EWUsVgRqXnE,607760,609600,it has so much metal flake in it it
EWUsVgRqXnE,609600,611519,actually hides your fingerprints soft
EWUsVgRqXnE,611519,613920,touch material love the red stitching
EWUsVgRqXnE,613920,616640,and it's super soft now for 2021 there
EWUsVgRqXnE,616640,619360,is a new infotainment system area this
EWUsVgRqXnE,619360,622480,is new for 2021 even in the camry trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,622480,624880,the bad news is is when you go trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,624880,626240,you're getting the smaller system this
EWUsVgRqXnE,626240,628399,is a seven inch screen
EWUsVgRqXnE,628399,630480,you can't get it on the camera tara d
EWUsVgRqXnE,630480,632320,but if you go other trim levels you
EWUsVgRqXnE,632320,635120,could get a new 9-inch system i do like
EWUsVgRqXnE,635120,636880,this system a lot better than what they
EWUsVgRqXnE,636880,638399,had before
EWUsVgRqXnE,638399,640160,it is on the small side i know you
EWUsVgRqXnE,640160,642240,probably heard that once or twice before
EWUsVgRqXnE,642240,643760,but this screen is definitely on the
EWUsVgRqXnE,643760,645519,smaller side no navigation but it does
EWUsVgRqXnE,645519,648079,have apple carplay and android auto let
EWUsVgRqXnE,648079,649200,me go ahead and show you the backup
EWUsVgRqXnE,649200,651600,camera it does take off up all seven
EWUsVgRqXnE,651600,653120,inches so the great news is if you have
EWUsVgRqXnE,653120,655600,seven inches you'll be able to use the
EWUsVgRqXnE,655600,657920,seven inches to the full extent and
EWUsVgRqXnE,657920,659279,remember it is a touch screen which is
EWUsVgRqXnE,659279,660480,nice
EWUsVgRqXnE,660480,662000,put it right back in the park and we're
EWUsVgRqXnE,662000,664079,back again there's that metallic finish
EWUsVgRqXnE,664079,665519,would have been nice to have a bright
EWUsVgRqXnE,665519,668480,red trd start stop button you got your
EWUsVgRqXnE,668480,671040,standard ac control so no dual climate i
EWUsVgRqXnE,671040,672480,hope you're keeping a checklist because
EWUsVgRqXnE,672480,675200,if you uh look at the honda accord the
EWUsVgRqXnE,675200,679200,mazda6 the sonata and the k5 they all
EWUsVgRqXnE,679200,681200,have dual climate control
EWUsVgRqXnE,681200,682640,and at this price point you might even
EWUsVgRqXnE,682640,684399,get navigation thrown in just for the
EWUsVgRqXnE,684399,687040,heck of it but it is easy to use i'm not
EWUsVgRqXnE,687040,689360,the biggest fan of this weird wiggly
EWUsVgRqXnE,689360,692160,line split section in the camry i've
EWUsVgRqXnE,692160,694480,never liked it even when they release
EWUsVgRqXnE,694480,696399,this generation but what i do like is
EWUsVgRqXnE,696399,698320,you do have usb
EWUsVgRqXnE,698320,700640,you have a 12 volt and i like the way
EWUsVgRqXnE,700640,703040,there's doors there no wireless charging
EWUsVgRqXnE,703040,704480,so you could use this you could put five
EWUsVgRqXnE,704480,706720,twinkies there your phone will go dead
EWUsVgRqXnE,706720,709200,but you will be able to uh eat some
EWUsVgRqXnE,709200,711360,twinkies open that up and then you're
EWUsVgRqXnE,711360,713279,gonna have a nice little cubby area it's
EWUsVgRqXnE,713279,715440,not felt line so i wouldn't put the hope
EWUsVgRqXnE,715440,716720,diamond in there because it's probably
EWUsVgRqXnE,716720,718000,going to get some scratches and you'll
EWUsVgRqXnE,718000,720720,lose value but that closes up nicely two
EWUsVgRqXnE,720720,722320,cup holders this is going to control
EWUsVgRqXnE,722320,724959,that eight speed automatic transmission
EWUsVgRqXnE,724959,727600,red trd stitching it even says trd on it
EWUsVgRqXnE,727600,729519,in case you forgot that you bought a
EWUsVgRqXnE,729519,731519,camry trd i'll put it back in the park
EWUsVgRqXnE,731519,733200,so we don't drive away with lori hanging
EWUsVgRqXnE,733200,734880,out of the passenger side
EWUsVgRqXnE,734880,737600,key fob it's boring
EWUsVgRqXnE,737600,739200,that's all i could say it's a zonk it
EWUsVgRqXnE,739200,741200,reminds me of the key fobs from the
EWUsVgRqXnE,741200,744079,early alarms like in the 1990s the ones
EWUsVgRqXnE,744079,746399,that would make like 32 different sounds
EWUsVgRqXnE,746399,748639,um and it doesn't say trd on it if
EWUsVgRqXnE,748639,749760,you're if you're giving me the extra
EWUsVgRqXnE,749760,752880,touches go all in or don't go at all
EWUsVgRqXnE,752880,754720,i do like the finishes here i like the
EWUsVgRqXnE,754720,756240,way it's gunmetal gray so there's no
EWUsVgRqXnE,756240,758240,fingerprints you get your three
EWUsVgRqXnE,758240,759920,different mode buttons
EWUsVgRqXnE,759920,761279,and then you have this sort of like
EWUsVgRqXnE,761279,764000,rubbermaid style armrest it is semi-soft
EWUsVgRqXnE,764000,765680,which is good and then bam
EWUsVgRqXnE,765680,767440,now you got a little bit of felt lining
EWUsVgRqXnE,767440,768639,you got two
EWUsVgRqXnE,768639,771360,usbs one's a usb the other one's a usbc
EWUsVgRqXnE,771360,773440,so that's a nice addition and the great
EWUsVgRqXnE,773440,774800,news is you can put your snickers in
EWUsVgRqXnE,774800,776800,here and not scratch your nuts and your
EWUsVgRqXnE,776800,777839,snickers
EWUsVgRqXnE,777839,779279,what you are going to get is this nice
EWUsVgRqXnE,779279,781760,headrest with the trd embroidery of
EWUsVgRqXnE,781760,783920,course we got red seatbelts hashtag

EWUsVgRqXnE,785600,787760,and we got the red lines i'm not really
EWUsVgRqXnE,787760,789279,a big fan of the style of the seat if
EWUsVgRqXnE,789279,792000,you've seen the avalon trd those are the
EWUsVgRqXnE,792000,794480,seats i wish that were in here manual
EWUsVgRqXnE,794480,796560,adjustment for the passenger i do have
EWUsVgRqXnE,796560,797920,electric assist
EWUsVgRqXnE,797920,799920,and there's plenty of headroom just no
EWUsVgRqXnE,799920,801680,sunroom so i don't know how you feel
EWUsVgRqXnE,801680,803200,about that but that could be a deal
EWUsVgRqXnE,803200,805040,breaker in your book but that's your
EWUsVgRqXnE,805040,806480,book and i'm not reading it why don't
EWUsVgRqXnE,806480,807839,you come over here though i want to show
EWUsVgRqXnE,807839,809760,you behind the wheel of this camera trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,809760,811600,all right guys business time behind the
EWUsVgRqXnE,811600,813360,wheel now there are some nice touches in
EWUsVgRqXnE,813360,815040,the foot box of course you're gonna get
EWUsVgRqXnE,815040,817519,those camry trd floor mats good for an
EWUsVgRqXnE,817519,819360,extra five horsepower maybe seven if
EWUsVgRqXnE,819360,821680,you're lucky with a tailwind we do have
EWUsVgRqXnE,821680,824079,the aluminum brake pedal and throttle
EWUsVgRqXnE,824079,826240,which is nice dead pedal
EWUsVgRqXnE,826240,827600,a little bland would have been nice if
EWUsVgRqXnE,827600,828880,they would have spruced that up now when
EWUsVgRqXnE,828880,831360,looking at the competition the accord
EWUsVgRqXnE,831360,833839,does have aluminum pedals you could get
EWUsVgRqXnE,833839,837279,also of course on the wrx mazda6 that's
EWUsVgRqXnE,837279,840240,a no-go and from what i can remember the
EWUsVgRqXnE,840240,844079,sonata n-line nor the kia k5 gt have any
EWUsVgRqXnE,844079,846240,kind of aluminum pedals but seats they
EWUsVgRqXnE,846240,847920,feel good they're really comfortable you
EWUsVgRqXnE,847920,849440,do have your electric assist for the
EWUsVgRqXnE,849440,851600,driver including the lower lumbar
EWUsVgRqXnE,851600,853279,steering wheel
EWUsVgRqXnE,853279,855600,it's a mixed bag i like the leather and
EWUsVgRqXnE,855600,857680,the red stitching reminds me of a
EWUsVgRqXnE,857680,859760,baseball that pete rose signed for me
EWUsVgRqXnE,859760,862320,once but uh the horn button is just
EWUsVgRqXnE,862320,864639,atrocious it's not sexy it's definitely
EWUsVgRqXnE,864639,867360,not trd so that's a major zonk you do
EWUsVgRqXnE,867360,868800,have these paddles on the back of the
EWUsVgRqXnE,868800,870800,steering wheel to go up and down the
EWUsVgRqXnE,870800,873360,eight-speed auto and then gauges
EWUsVgRqXnE,873360,875040,you're gonna get a lot of analog so
EWUsVgRqXnE,875040,876880,analog attack analog speedometer fuel
EWUsVgRqXnE,876880,879600,gauge and cooling gauge and that's a 4.2
EWUsVgRqXnE,879600,882079,inch digital display in the center i
EWUsVgRqXnE,882079,883839,like the analog gauges especially the
EWUsVgRqXnE,883839,886639,way they're that bright red trd color
EWUsVgRqXnE,886639,887360,but
EWUsVgRqXnE,887360,889279,compared to the competition you might
EWUsVgRqXnE,889279,890800,like what they're bringing especially
EWUsVgRqXnE,890800,892240,with larger digital screens but why
EWUsVgRqXnE,892240,893920,don't we get to the back seat and see
EWUsVgRqXnE,893920,895920,how this stacks up with those
EWUsVgRqXnE,895920,898480,competitors all right guys backseat time
EWUsVgRqXnE,898480,900639,and this is where really it proves that
EWUsVgRqXnE,900639,903360,midsize sedans are still a thing and are
EWUsVgRqXnE,903360,905760,still very usable lots of room back here
EWUsVgRqXnE,905760,907839,just like the competition it's going to
EWUsVgRqXnE,907839,909040,be really
EWUsVgRqXnE,909040,911440,splitting hairs on who has the most
EWUsVgRqXnE,911440,913120,passenger room especially in the back
EWUsVgRqXnE,913120,914639,seat but i got plenty of headroom which
EWUsVgRqXnE,914639,917199,is awesome seats that nice soft material
EWUsVgRqXnE,917199,920000,all the way around large pockets so what
EWUsVgRqXnE,920000,921440,you could put in here is maybe like a
EWUsVgRqXnE,921440,923040,simon says you can even put like a
EWUsVgRqXnE,923040,925440,travel size monopoly the only warning i
EWUsVgRqXnE,925440,927120,have for you is if you play monopoly on
EWUsVgRqXnE,927120,929279,a family road trip expect your family
EWUsVgRqXnE,929279,931040,members to hate one another but you know
EWUsVgRqXnE,931040,932480,what maybe they already hate one another
EWUsVgRqXnE,932480,934880,so maybe it might be a bit a good thing
EWUsVgRqXnE,934880,937120,but you have a good uh sized twinkie
EWUsVgRqXnE,937120,938880,tray here you could easily put four
EWUsVgRqXnE,938880,941040,twinkies that's two per person in the
EWUsVgRqXnE,941040,942240,back seat unless you have the one
EWUsVgRqXnE,942240,944160,oddball in the middle uh you could give
EWUsVgRqXnE,944160,946959,them half a twinkie we do have two usbs
EWUsVgRqXnE,946959,949519,and it's lit up with blue led light that
EWUsVgRqXnE,949519,951600,lets you know that hey you'll always be
EWUsVgRqXnE,951600,954480,able to find your way with your charging
EWUsVgRqXnE,954480,956320,over here on my side i got my own pocket

EWUsVgRqXnE,959360,960880,heck i want to put in there right now a
EWUsVgRqXnE,960880,962800,back scratcher because i got this itch
EWUsVgRqXnE,962800,964959,from this mosquito that bit me in this
EWUsVgRqXnE,964959,966800,camry trd
EWUsVgRqXnE,966800,969360,wasn't good seats though just as
EWUsVgRqXnE,969360,971440,comfortable up front

EWUsVgRqXnE,1016000,1018959,performance is 15 cubic feet of space
EWUsVgRqXnE,1018959,1021120,the nice thing is is of course that
EWUsVgRqXnE,1021120,1022560,seat's going to be able to fold down
EWUsVgRqXnE,1022560,1024959,you'll be able to get some nice longer
EWUsVgRqXnE,1024959,1026558,items in there and when you look at the

EWUsVgRqXnE,1088160,1090640,and stays planted so you're definitely
EWUsVgRqXnE,1090640,1092320,getting a faster camera even though we
EWUsVgRqXnE,1092320,1094240,don't have the extra horsepower which i
EWUsVgRqXnE,1094240,1096320,am going to zonk that would be nice to
EWUsVgRqXnE,1096320,1099840,have around 400 horsepower
EWUsVgRqXnE,1099840,1102000,maybe 350. i'll settle 350. i'll stop

EWUsVgRqXnE,1106400,1109440,400 horsepower but 350 horsepower would
EWUsVgRqXnE,1109440,1112480,really go a nice long way with this
EWUsVgRqXnE,1112480,1114799,vehicle and just make it that something
EWUsVgRqXnE,1114799,1116480,extra special you're not getting the
EWUsVgRqXnE,1116480,1118640,extra power but you are getting the
EWUsVgRqXnE,1118640,1120960,extra performance from all the different
EWUsVgRqXnE,1120960,1122480,tunings that they did
EWUsVgRqXnE,1122480,1125280,from the suspension the brakes the
EWUsVgRqXnE,1125280,1127840,handling that's gonna make you
EWUsVgRqXnE,1127840,1130240,faster and the way that the car
