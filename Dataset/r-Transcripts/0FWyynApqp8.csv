0FWyynApqp8,82720,88560,i've borrowed this shiron puresport from  bugatti newport beach which is of course
0FWyynApqp8,88560,95040,the bugatti dealership here in newport  beach in southern california bugatti  newport beach recently got this pure
0FWyynApqp8,95040,102159,sport into their inventory it is the  only one offered for sale right now in  all of north america the shiron pure
0FWyynApqp8,102159,107600,sport currently available at bugatti  newport beach so let's talk shiron
0FWyynApqp8,107600,113600,puresport the bugatti chiron came out  back in 2016 and since then bugatti has
0FWyynApqp8,113600,118719,released a few special edition models  that enhance things a bit there was the
0FWyynApqp8,118719,126560,track focused shiron sport then there  was the shiron super sport with more  power and now there's this the shiron
0FWyynApqp8,126560,132000,puresport a handling focused version of  the car designed for race track drivers
0FWyynApqp8,132000,138800,with lighter weight and other  improvements and it isn't cheap a  regular shiron is very expensive but
0FWyynApqp8,138800,146480,this is a step up from that figure  around three and a half to four million  dollars for this car but it gets you a
0FWyynApqp8,146480,154400,lot around 1500 horsepower 0-60 in 2.4  seconds and exclusivity since bugatti
0FWyynApqp8,154400,159599,will only make 60 units of the pure  sport for the entire world and today i'm
0FWyynApqp8,159599,165599,going to review this one first i'm going  to take you on a tour of it and show you  all of its interesting quirks and
0FWyynApqp8,165599,172640,features then i'll get it out on the  road and drive it and then i'll give it  a doug score
0FWyynApqp8,178959,185760,all right i'm going to start the quirks  and features of the shiron pure sport by  discussing the shiron box i have
0FWyynApqp8,185760,192239,reviewed several bugatti models but i  have never been able to show you the  accessories that come with the bugatti
0FWyynApqp8,192239,197280,the stuff they give you but i'm gonna do  that today you spend over three million
0FWyynApqp8,197280,203120,dollars for a car you get more than just  a car you also get a box this box a
0FWyynApqp8,203120,208159,rather sizable box this silver box with  the bugatti logo on top and in the front
0FWyynApqp8,208159,214239,it says shiron puresport very beautiful  very luxurious box that comes with the
0FWyynApqp8,214239,220400,car so what is inside the box well you  open it up and the first thing you see  is this blue folder that says bugatti on
0FWyynApqp8,220400,226400,top and shiron in the middle this just  contains some relatively minor paperwork  a couple of documents from the factory
0FWyynApqp8,226400,232720,letting you know the spec of the car  this has the certificate of origin in it  probably when you buy it this would also  include your dealership information your
0FWyynApqp8,232720,239040,purchase documents that sort of thing  nothing too special but you lift up this  blue folder and you're greeted by a
0FWyynApqp8,239040,245120,piece of carbon fiber that says shiron  pure sport and that's the beginnings of
0FWyynApqp8,245120,251920,your box now you lift the foam off the  first layer of your box here and you  discover that this carbon fiber piece is
0FWyynApqp8,251920,257120,actually a box itself you lift it out  you can see it's trimmed to match the
0FWyynApqp8,257120,262160,car so you have blue stitching all down  the sides very beautiful and a lot of
0FWyynApqp8,262160,269440,carbon fiber which matches a lot of the  exterior carbon fiber of the car that is  this special shiron puresport matching
0FWyynApqp8,269440,275040,box so what's inside the box inside the  box open it up and you will find your
0FWyynApqp8,275040,281840,key placed right in the center like a  piece of fine jewelry that of course  unlocks and starts your shiron below
0FWyynApqp8,281840,287680,that you have a usb stick which says one  of 500 now i already mentioned the
0FWyynApqp8,287680,294240,shiron puresport is one of 60 but  they're going to make 500 total shiron  so i guess every xiron owner gets the
0FWyynApqp8,294240,302479,one of 500 usb regardless of which  version of the car you have but that's  in this box the key and the usb now you
0FWyynApqp8,302479,308639,can see in this display area the key and  usb are placed on this leather surface  which is also trend with light blue
0FWyynApqp8,308639,315440,stitching again to match the color of  the car very beautiful and fantastic  presentation and you can lift these
0FWyynApqp8,315440,321840,items out you lift up this level of the  box inside the box and then you get to  another piece where you have your
0FWyynApqp8,321840,326960,owner's manual in here this is the  bugatti chiron official owner's manual
0FWyynApqp8,326960,333120,this black book and i really love the  fact that when you open it it talks  about how environmentally friendly the
0FWyynApqp8,333120,339759,owner's manual is printed on  chlorine-free bleached cellulose
0FWyynApqp8,339759,347280,thank you that's very important to have  an environmentally friendly owner's  manual for your seven mile per gallon
0FWyynApqp8,347280,352720,car but they probably have to put that  in probably all volkswagen group cars  have that in there now one interesting
0FWyynApqp8,352720,359360,thing on the next page of the owner's  manual the welcome page you just have  kind of a lot of buzzwords it's not  really very personalized welcome to the
0FWyynApqp8,359360,366400,most dynamic bugatti the elegant  interior the radical steering blah blah  blah it doesn't really say anything too
0FWyynApqp8,366400,372160,crazy and that's generally true  throughout this owner's manual very  german very to the point not  particularly charming or weird or
0FWyynApqp8,372160,377840,frankly quirky now it's also worth  noting sharing this area with the box  inside the box you have some screws in
0FWyynApqp8,377840,384080,the upper left corner of this part you  also have the front license plate  bracket here so if you want to mount a
0FWyynApqp8,384080,390000,front license plate on your bugatti this  is where you can do it i'm sure no one  has ever done this at least not in the
0FWyynApqp8,390000,395919,states but they can at least say hey we  gave you the front license plate mount  you just chose not to use it but anyway
0FWyynApqp8,395919,402479,you lift up this layer of foam and you  get down to a lower layer of the box and  that's where you have the bugatti car
0FWyynApqp8,402479,409280,cover that's what you see inside this  bag with the bugatti logo on it that is  your fitted bugatti chiron pier sport
0FWyynApqp8,409280,414560,car cover also in this area you can see  there's a hole and something is missing  that's where the battery tender is
0FWyynApqp8,414560,420960,located but because this car is on  display in a showroom they've already  taken the battery tender out and they're  using it but that's where it would be
0FWyynApqp8,420960,428319,and those are the contents of your  bugatti chiron box you buy this car you  get the box and that's what's inside now
0FWyynApqp8,428319,434720,you know but anyway moving on from the  box and on to the car next up in the  quirks and features i want to discuss
0FWyynApqp8,434720,440720,the spare key now there was a spot in  the box for the spare key right next to  the owner's manual there's a little hole
0FWyynApqp8,440720,447520,but i've taken the spare key out because  i want to highlight the fact that it is  just a volkswagen audi folding key you
0FWyynApqp8,447520,454240,have the bugatti logo on one side you  have lock and unlock on the other side  that's it i had this exact same key in a
0FWyynApqp8,454240,460000,2001 audi a4 that i owned and here it is  in a three and a half million dollar
0FWyynApqp8,460000,465759,exotic supercar now as i recall the  bugatti veyron the predecessor to this  car that was the only key it was just
0FWyynApqp8,465759,471520,sort of a modified volkswagen key at  least here it's the spare key and the  actual key is nicer but it's still funny
0FWyynApqp8,471520,476800,to see them giving that reused recycle  it's got to be a 15 year old part that
0FWyynApqp8,476800,483199,you get in a volkswagen jetta and here  it is in the bugatti chiron but anyway  the interior of this car now i'm not
0FWyynApqp8,483199,489360,going to go over every single little  thing in here like i usually do for  supercars hyper cars at this price point
0FWyynApqp8,489360,494960,because i've already done the bugatti  chiron review and i recently did the  bugatti devo which is pretty similar but
0FWyynApqp8,494960,500720,i do want to cover the highlights and  the first highlight that you notice when  you climb in here is the interior
0FWyynApqp8,500720,506639,materials in this car unlike in the  regular shiron where you have beautiful  fine
0FWyynApqp8,506639,511759,leather and aluminum everywhere this car  trades that stuff out for carbon fiber
0FWyynApqp8,511759,519279,and alcantara it's trying to save weight  and trying to get more racy and give it  a sportier track focused feel to go
0FWyynApqp8,519279,525360,along with the pure sport ideology it's  stuff like that interior materials and  other weight savings that have helped
0FWyynApqp8,525360,531440,this car shed about 110 pounds compared  to a regular bugatti chiron not a huge
0FWyynApqp8,531440,537279,number for a car that's relatively heavy  like this one is but it's still  something makes it a little lighter for
0FWyynApqp8,537279,543200,race track driving but anyway next up i  want to move on to these very  distinctive displays and dials in the
0FWyynApqp8,543200,550320,center console of this car you can see  there are four specific dials and right  now they are displaying at the very top
0FWyynApqp8,550320,555680,you have your horsepower that you're  currently using then right below that  you have your current speed that you're
0FWyynApqp8,555680,561600,traveling then below that you have the  rpm that you're currently at and then  below that you have the gear that you're
0FWyynApqp8,561600,567920,in four different dials with four  different displays and you can change  them to be various different things you
0FWyynApqp8,567920,574160,go into the gauge cluster and you can  adjust the center display to show a  multitude of different items for
0FWyynApqp8,574160,579920,instance if you go into performance mode  in the gauge cluster and select that you  can see now these center displays are
0FWyynApqp8,579920,585920,showing things like the top speed that  you have achieved during this trip if  you go into cruise mode in the gauge
0FWyynApqp8,585920,592240,cluster you can see now these center  displays are showing things like your  average speed your cruising range and
0FWyynApqp8,592240,599200,your average fuel economy amazing that  this car even offers the ability to  check that but it does so you can set
0FWyynApqp8,599200,604880,these displays to show basically  whatever it is that you want and check  this out there's a little hidden easter
0FWyynApqp8,604880,610079,egg with these displays on the very  bottom display there's a little button  with arrows pointing if you press that
0FWyynApqp8,610079,617120,and hold it down then the displays as  you can see are now showing your climate  control so you can adjust where the air
0FWyynApqp8,617120,622880,is coming out your fan speed your  climate temperature and on the bottom  you can adjust your heated seats you
0FWyynApqp8,622880,629920,press this little button with the arrows  but don't hold it down and you can  switch which seat you're adjusting and  then you twist the little dial around
0FWyynApqp8,629920,636640,the display and that lets you adjust the  heated seat amount now if you hold down  this bottom button again that will take
0FWyynApqp8,636640,642800,your center displays back to whatever  you had them displaying before and you  can toggle between the display that
0FWyynApqp8,642800,648480,you've selected with like your speed or  whatever or your climate controls by  pressing and holding down that button
0FWyynApqp8,648480,655839,now you might be thinking this is an  expensive car why didn't they just give  it a center touch screen like everything  else cheap cars have touch screens why
0FWyynApqp8,655839,663519,does it this but there's a good reason  for it bugatti knows these cars will be  preserved and in 50 60 100 years they
0FWyynApqp8,663519,668640,will still be around and they'll still  be special and if bugatti had put a  center touch screen in here it would
0FWyynApqp8,668640,675360,start to look outdated very very quickly  and so by minimizing the amount of  screens in this car and instead going
0FWyynApqp8,675360,681519,with these displays and dials you've  essentially sort of future-proofed the  car you've made sure it won't look so
0FWyynApqp8,681519,687040,outdated and terrible when it's parked  at a concur delegates in 35 years people
0FWyynApqp8,687040,692720,won't look in and laugh at the terrible  old screen and by the way speaking of  relatively subtle controls in this car
0FWyynApqp8,692720,698560,how about the cruise control system this  car has cruise control but figuring out  how to operate it is a bit of a
0FWyynApqp8,698560,705279,challenge it's on the turn signal stock  and it's confined to just two little  controls for one there's a little switch
0FWyynApqp8,705279,710560,you can turn from on to off that  activates or deactivates cruise control  and then there's a little switch at the
0FWyynApqp8,710560,716000,end of the signal stock that lets you  adjust the speed higher or lower that's  it there's no path of the steering wheel
0FWyynApqp8,716000,721440,devoted to all sorts of cruise control  buttons you just have two little ones  sort of subtly placed there you probably
0FWyynApqp8,721440,726720,wouldn't even know you have it next i'm  moving on to some other stuff that's  cool in here for one the roof has these
0FWyynApqp8,726720,732480,glass panels which are very beautiful  you have one on the driver's side one on  the passenger side a lot of these cars
0FWyynApqp8,732480,738959,have a fixed coupe hard top roof which  kind of makes the interior feel a little  bit claustrophobic i like these glass
0FWyynApqp8,738959,744160,panels because it brings in the outside  makes it feel more open less  claustrophobic in here although these
0FWyynApqp8,744160,749279,panels don't open and as you can see you  can get some sun through here so some  people tint the panels unfortunately
0FWyynApqp8,749279,754720,they don't operate where you just press  the button and it auto tints like in  some cars this is just what you have and
0FWyynApqp8,754720,761040,speaking of the ceiling in this car one  of my very favorite interior items in  new bugatti models is the interior
0FWyynApqp8,761040,767680,ambient light which is  this light pipe that goes all the way  from the ceiling all the way down behind
0FWyynApqp8,767680,774560,the seats and then almost into the  center consoles this giant sort of  c-shape which is intended to mimic that
0FWyynApqp8,774560,781760,same shape on the outside of the car you  can see sort of going around the door  and then curving up over the roof that
0FWyynApqp8,781760,788160,is carried into the interior with the  light so how does it operate as a light  well you move this little switch on the
0FWyynApqp8,788160,794639,ceiling and that turns the light on and  then that's your interior dome light in  your car probably just a little dome
0FWyynApqp8,794639,801040,light on the ceiling in this it's this  gorgeous c-shape going all the way  through the interior very cool next up i
0FWyynApqp8,801040,808320,want to talk about engines starting in  this car to start the engine you press  this giant red button on the steering  wheel marked engine and that turns the
0FWyynApqp8,808320,814320,car on now there is a little key slot on  the dashboard next to the steering  column where you can insert the key but
0FWyynApqp8,814320,819519,you don't have to do that in order to  start the engine this car has a  proximity key so it will know if the key
0FWyynApqp8,819519,824720,is in the car and it will let you start  the engine or you can put it in that  slot if you want to now also worth
0FWyynApqp8,824720,831199,noting over on the other side of the  steering wheel there's another red  button that's actually a dial and you  can use it to cycle through various
0FWyynApqp8,831199,836800,different modes you have like a highway  mode a high performance mode a regular  bugatti mode and then over on the left
0FWyynApqp8,836800,842639,an arrow pointing up that activates the  lifter and so you twist the dial to that  and then the lift will go up so you can
0FWyynApqp8,842639,848480,clear sort of like driveways that might  be steep or anything else where you  might fear that you'll scrape your pure
0FWyynApqp8,848480,855760,sport also worth discussing in here is  the operation of the gear lever which is  rather unusual when you start the cards  in sort of the center to put it in drive
0FWyynApqp8,855760,862000,you move it over to the right then  you're in drive and it goes back to the  center if you want to put it in neutral  move it to the left you're in neutral
0FWyynApqp8,862000,867279,and again it goes back to the center and  if you want to put it in reverse move it  to the left and then down then you're in
0FWyynApqp8,867279,872880,reverse but again it pops back to the  center now if you want to up shift or  downshift while you're driving the car
0FWyynApqp8,872880,878560,you can move the gear lever forward or  backwards for upshift and downshift or  you can just use the paddles on the
0FWyynApqp8,878560,884399,steering wheel like most cars have your  last operation with this gear lever if  you want to put it in park you press the
0FWyynApqp8,884399,889920,top it's actually a button and then the  car goes into park kind of a strange  operation but you do get used to it to
0FWyynApqp8,889920,896560,me though one of this car's most amazing  features is the sheer attention to  detail in pretty much every space you
0FWyynApqp8,896560,903279,can possibly find as an example in the  door panel the storage pocket you open  it up and you have the exterior color of
0FWyynApqp8,903279,908880,the car in your door panel storage  pocket you probably won't get in there  all that often or see it all that often
0FWyynApqp8,908880,915600,but it's there for when you do and the  attention to detail goes way beyond that  the power window switches are even
0FWyynApqp8,915600,923440,trimmed in the exterior color a lot of  new cars offer like exterior colored  stitching inside power window switch
0FWyynApqp8,923440,930399,trim that is the level of attention to  detail that bugatti is on and check this  out open up the glove box and you have
0FWyynApqp8,930399,936240,the exterior color brought into the  interior even there again a space you'll  never use you'll probably fill it you
0FWyynApqp8,936240,943279,won't even see the exterior color but no  space in this car was not beautifully  thought about and perfectly thought
0FWyynApqp8,943279,949360,through to make it as perfect and  detailed as possible with that said even  in the interior of a bugatti there are
0FWyynApqp8,949360,955680,some drawbacks and in this case to me  the biggest one is the fact that it has  manual seats or at least manual forward
0FWyynApqp8,955680,962399,or backward you have to lift a little  lever in front and then slide your  weight forward or backward to move the  seats around now bugatti would tell you
0FWyynApqp8,962399,968560,they did this because it's this high  performance handling version of the  shiron and they saved weight by removing
0FWyynApqp8,968560,975040,the power seat but this car has a power  backrest and a power seat bottom to go
0FWyynApqp8,975040,982079,up and down it just doesn't have a power  forward or backward movement so the seat  motors are all still there they haven't
0FWyynApqp8,982079,987199,really saved any weight it's just a  gimmick so people can tell their  passengers oh this has manual seats
0FWyynApqp8,987199,992399,because it's the track focused handling  version so we've saved weight from your
0FWyynApqp8,992399,997600,luxury model it's such a ridiculous  gimmick i mean come on this has heated  seats
0FWyynApqp8,997600,1004000,if you have heated seats you're not  really that focused on weight savings  you can cut the act and put the power
0FWyynApqp8,1004000,1010720,seats back in and speaking of the seats  this car has child seat anchors you can  see behind the passenger seat this
0FWyynApqp8,1010720,1018399,little panel presumably lifts off and  you can anchor a child seat here so you  can take a child in your bugatti chiron
0FWyynApqp8,1018399,1025038,but you don't have power seats kind of  stupid and next up moving outside the  shiron pure sport where this car has
0FWyynApqp8,1025038,1030640,some more obvious changes compared to  the regular shiron in addition to the  ones inside probably the most obvious is
0FWyynApqp8,1030640,1036959,this wing this large fixed wing back  here the regular shiron also has a wing  but it's adjustable it goes up or down
0FWyynApqp8,1036959,1044558,when the car meets certain conditions  but this wing on the pure sport is fixed  in place and it is huge massive in fact
0FWyynApqp8,1044558,1050160,spanning the entire width of the car  obviously intending to provide more  downforce again for better handling and
0FWyynApqp8,1050160,1055440,track capabilities and there's more to  it than that in the back you can see a  completely different exhaust outlet
0FWyynApqp8,1055440,1060480,compared to the regular shiron that's  because the pure sport has a 3d printed
0FWyynApqp8,1060480,1065679,aluminum exhaust it looks more  aggressive and it sounds more aggressive
0FWyynApqp8,1065679,1070360,too take a listen to this car revving
0FWyynApqp8,1071220,1074440,[Music]
0FWyynApqp8,1081120,1086640,and next up another change to the pure  sport of the regular she road is the  wheels you can see the spokes have
0FWyynApqp8,1086640,1092240,little holes in them bugatti calls these  arrow blades and they are designed to
0FWyynApqp8,1092240,1097520,channel air in a particular direction  again to improve downforce you have your
0FWyynApqp8,1097520,1102799,little arrow blades and the wheels a  very interesting and unusual design you  wouldn't see it unless you look closely
0FWyynApqp8,1102799,1109440,but they're there and very unusual you  don't see too many holes in the wheel  spokes of very many vehicles now
0FWyynApqp8,1109440,1116960,speaking of the wheels i want to talk  tires this car uses michelin pilot sport  cup 2r tires that were co-developed with
0FWyynApqp8,1116960,1124480,michelin specifically for this car they  are very grippy and they are again  intended to improve handling by having
0FWyynApqp8,1124480,1130400,grippier tires than the standard chiron  and finally one other notable handling  related change made to the shiron
0FWyynApqp8,1130400,1135440,puresport over the regular shiron this  car has stiffer suspension than the
0FWyynApqp8,1135440,1142320,regular shiron sportier more aggressive  suspension now the result is the ride  quality probably isn't quite as good but
0FWyynApqp8,1142320,1148720,stiffer suspension makes generally for  better handling and so they've done it  for this car this is the enthusiast spec
0FWyynApqp8,1148720,1154160,of the bugatti chiron and next up we  move on to the rest of the extra items  with this car starting up front with
0FWyynApqp8,1154160,1161200,this very aggressive front end design  you can see the traditional bugatti  grill but around that you have giant air
0FWyynApqp8,1161200,1166880,intakes and a much more aggressive  carbon fiber front splitter than the  standard shirone again to underscore
0FWyynApqp8,1166880,1173679,that this is the more aggressive track  focused model but this car in front does  carry over one thing i love from the
0FWyynApqp8,1173679,1179520,shiro and that would be the headlights  when they are on you can see the running  lights are these four squares on each
0FWyynApqp8,1179520,1185039,side tremendously distinctive and when  you put on the turn signal you have  these little turn signal lights
0FWyynApqp8,1185039,1191919,underlining each one of the four squares  again tremendously distinctive i love  that look up front when this car is on
0FWyynApqp8,1191919,1197120,but i especially love what happens with  these lights when you walk up to the car  and unlock it you tap the unlock button
0FWyynApqp8,1197120,1203200,and you can see the lights put on a  little show as they light up to  illuminate and let you know that it's
0FWyynApqp8,1203200,1208720,your car and i like that little welcome  lighting design a lot of automakers are  doing this but this is one of my
0FWyynApqp8,1208720,1214960,favorite welcomes to the car and next up  moving on to the back of the pier sport  very distinctive back here too not just
0FWyynApqp8,1214960,1220880,because of the wing and the giant  exhaust but frankly the entire rear end  again far more aggressive than the
0FWyynApqp8,1220880,1227760,standard chiron in the case of this rear  diffuser tons of carbon fiber back here  very very obviously more aggressive than
0FWyynApqp8,1227760,1233600,the regular car and a very distinctive  look now you do have an interesting  lighting design back here you have a
0FWyynApqp8,1233600,1240000,giant light bar thin strip that goes  across the entire rear of the car and  you also have some rather strange
0FWyynApqp8,1240000,1245760,looking tail lights they have this sort  of aero design to them you can see when  the rear turn signal is on how they sort
0FWyynApqp8,1245760,1252000,of light up it's an interesting look for  sure and again very bugatti nobody else  is using anything even close to this
0FWyynApqp8,1252000,1258640,look and next up moving to another  interesting quirk of the shiron it  doesn't really tell you what it is on
0FWyynApqp8,1258640,1264240,the outside you do have some bugatti  logos front rear on the wheels that sort  of thing but it doesn't really say
0FWyynApqp8,1264240,1271760,shiron anywhere or pure sport except in  two places one is this little door fuel
0FWyynApqp8,1271760,1277600,door looking thing on the driver's side  and the other is this little fuel door  looking thing on the passenger side
0FWyynApqp8,1277600,1284960,where in both cases it says shiron  piersport but that is all so you might  be wondering why two fuel doors what do
0FWyynApqp8,1284960,1290640,those do well over on the passenger side  you push it open and that's where you  add fuel you pull up to a gas pump you
0FWyynApqp8,1290640,1297440,put the gas in pretty simple just like  basically every car on the driver's side  that little fuel door thing is where you
0FWyynApqp8,1297440,1304159,add oil you pop that open a little  button inside the car and then you can  put oil in the engine there in case it's
0FWyynApqp8,1304159,1309840,running low now you might be wondering  why do you put oil in to like a fuel  door instead of around the engine like
0FWyynApqp8,1309840,1315039,basically every other car and the reason  for that is in this car you can't access
0FWyynApqp8,1315039,1320320,the engine this rear cover doesn't come  off except at the bugatti dealership
0FWyynApqp8,1320320,1325360,where trained technicians can remove it  instead it's fixed in place you can't
0FWyynApqp8,1325360,1330799,pull it off you don't have access to the  engine but you can see a little bit of
0FWyynApqp8,1330799,1336240,the engine from the top and it is  beautiful with bugatti logos reminding
0FWyynApqp8,1336240,1341360,you exactly what this engine is this  thing isn't screwing around i just love
0FWyynApqp8,1341360,1347080,looking into this engine bay and seeing  that massive 16 16-cylinder
0FWyynApqp8,1347080,1352640,1500 horsepower engine it is a serious  piece of machinery now as you can see
0FWyynApqp8,1352640,1359600,going over the engine bay is this line  that sort of bisects it cuts it right in  half that line starts on the roof of the
0FWyynApqp8,1359600,1366080,car above the passenger compartment and  it goes all the way to the back it's  sort of a beauty line that traces the
0FWyynApqp8,1366080,1372080,shape of the car as it goes further back  and frankly i think it looks pretty cool  and finally we move into the front
0FWyynApqp8,1372080,1378159,compartment in this shiron pure sport  this is the trunk the only real luggage  space you get with this car and you can
0FWyynApqp8,1378159,1384960,see it's pretty small and it's even  smaller because there's this metal strip  that sort of cuts it in half that's
0FWyynApqp8,1384960,1391120,placed in the middle of it the reason  they do this is for compliance purposes  if the cargo area is large enough to fit
0FWyynApqp8,1391120,1397280,like a small child then you have to  install an emergency inside trunk  release so the child could get out if
0FWyynApqp8,1397280,1402960,they accidentally fall in or get  kidnapped or whatever by putting this  like blade thing in the center it splits
0FWyynApqp8,1402960,1410080,up the cargo area into two smaller  components neither of which mandate that  they put in an interior trunk release
0FWyynApqp8,1410080,1416640,most owners who actually want to use  this luggage space can simply remove  this after they buy the car but when  they sell it new this has to be there or
0FWyynApqp8,1416640,1421760,else the car isn't complying with the  regulation about the interior latch very  interesting and there are a few other
0FWyynApqp8,1421760,1427279,interesting things about this cargo area  for one you have a nice plaque in here  that reminds you this is a limited
0FWyynApqp8,1427279,1432320,edition one of 60 pure sport model  that's cool to see you also have another
0FWyynApqp8,1432320,1438799,label in here this time a warning label  that lets you know the temperature  inside this trunk may exceed 120 degrees
0FWyynApqp8,1438799,1445279,fahrenheit or 50 celsius it's letting  you know it could heat up in here so  don't put anything that wouldn't do well
0FWyynApqp8,1445279,1451200,with heat in your trunk because it might  not go well maybe there'd be a fire just  wants to let you know two other
0FWyynApqp8,1451200,1456320,important items in here worth mentioning  for one inside this little bugatti  branded case this is where the battery
0FWyynApqp8,1456320,1462080,charger is i mentioned before it comes  in the bugatti box but in this case it's  out and it's right here you also have a
0FWyynApqp8,1462080,1467679,tire inflator kit in here over to the  side sort of molded to the shape of the  cargo area obviously this doesn't come
0FWyynApqp8,1467679,1473760,with a spare tire so your tire inflator  kit is all you get just in case you have  a flat in your bugatti and you want to
0FWyynApqp8,1473760,1480159,try to fix it by the side of the road  unlikely and so  those are the quirks and features of the
0FWyynApqp8,1480159,1485520,bugatti chiron pure sport now it's time  to get it out on the road and see how it
0FWyynApqp8,1485520,1490960,drives all right driving the pure sport  uh we're in a mass because i have
0FWyynApqp8,1490960,1497200,someone with me from bugatti newport  beach obviously i should not be trusted  to drive a vehicle like this by myself
0FWyynApqp8,1497200,1502640,it's terrifying you know getting in this  car the first thing you think you just  have intimidation you can't not um this
0FWyynApqp8,1502640,1509279,is like the fifth or sixth bugatti i've  reviewed on my channel  but every time i still feel incredibly
0FWyynApqp8,1509279,1514880,intimidated these are  unbelievably valuable cars  the good thing about this car though is
0FWyynApqp8,1514880,1521200,it feels pretty drivable so as these  cars go it is intimidating because the  value is intimidating but unlike for
0FWyynApqp8,1521200,1527919,instance the mclaren p1 gtr which i  recently reviewed that car was  intimidating from a driving perspective  you felt like it might try to kill you
0FWyynApqp8,1527919,1533279,this car is just intimidating from a  value perspective because you can drive  it pretty easily and pretty well
0FWyynApqp8,1533279,1537240,i'm gonna step on it here
0FWyynApqp8,1542360,1548320,oh my god  there is  there are a few cars on earth for the
0FWyynApqp8,1548320,1555919,acceleration like that  wow the road just comes at you so fast
0FWyynApqp8,1555919,1561360,you just don't have time to react if  there's like something in the room i  mean it's just an unbelievable
0FWyynApqp8,1561360,1566880,speed i've  it's hard to describe it's funny because  you drive a 458 and a lot of people
0FWyynApqp8,1566880,1572000,watching these driven 911s or you know  things like that and you think they're  fast and they are those are fast cars
0FWyynApqp8,1572000,1577440,but there's like a whole other level of  speed when you spend this much and when  you get into this level of rarefication
0FWyynApqp8,1577440,1584159,with a car that just it takes it into a  completely different world i mean you  can just feel your eyes going back in
0FWyynApqp8,1584159,1590400,your head you're just it's like nothing  i've ever experienced before  acceleration like this and this car  delivers it very well you know a lot of
0FWyynApqp8,1590400,1596720,the really really fast exotic sports  cars i drive the koenigseggs the p1 gtr  they're pretty rough and to an extent
0FWyynApqp8,1596720,1603039,that's kind of a cool thing you feel it  you hear it it's all coming at you this  car though is a lot more and it's one of
0FWyynApqp8,1603039,1608159,the things i've always loved about this  car it's a lot more bentley-like it's a  lot more luxurious you get the amazing
0FWyynApqp8,1608159,1615039,acceleration of the craziest car on the  planet but it's it's relatively  comfortable and easy while you do it and
0FWyynApqp8,1615039,1621200,if you want to just sit here and go 40  you can do that too i am just amazed by  the performance of this car but i am
0FWyynApqp8,1621200,1627120,also amazed by the comfortability you  can definitely tell it's harsher in here  though than in a regular shiron
0FWyynApqp8,1627120,1633600,the ride quality is definitely a little  rougher with the intent obviously better  handling that's the whole point of this
0FWyynApqp8,1633600,1640600,car  and you can tell the suspension has been  firmed up to make that possible
0FWyynApqp8,1645919,1653039,there's nothing  comparable that i can even explain  the acceleration feels like it's like
0FWyynApqp8,1653039,1658080,nothing on the planet it's unbelievable  it's so much faster than any of the
0FWyynApqp8,1658080,1664000,fastest roller coasters i've ever been  on maybe rocket ships feel like this i  just cannot believe how fast this car
0FWyynApqp8,1664000,1669679,feels when you accelerate hard  and i also can't believe how then like  docile it feels if you just want to
0FWyynApqp8,1669679,1676000,drive normally it definitely does feel  like it handles better um than the  shiron you can tell it's surprising they
0FWyynApqp8,1676000,1681200,haven't lost that much weight but  there's enough little tuning in various  different areas suspension
0FWyynApqp8,1681200,1687200,and tires that you can tell it has a  little bit more of an immediate feel to  it a little bit more of a sports car
0FWyynApqp8,1687200,1689840,feel frankly
0FWyynApqp8,1695200,1700799,it's indescribable it is so fast and it  feels so effortless it's so fast that i
0FWyynApqp8,1700799,1708399,mean even two seconds on the throttle  you're already way way too fast in any  reasonable life situation and the road
0FWyynApqp8,1708399,1713600,is now coming at you at a speed that is  too quick for you to even react to it  and so
0FWyynApqp8,1713600,1720320,you have to have a big wide open space  and even then a lot of courage  for you to be able to really get on it
0FWyynApqp8,1720320,1725919,what an unbelievable thing it is so cool  and i still love the fact that they're  able to make it so luxurious and feels
0FWyynApqp8,1725919,1732080,so nice in here i totally think you  could daily drive this if you were  willing to stomach the maintenance and  running costs
0FWyynApqp8,1732080,1738799,um  it's just one of the best all-around  cars and i do think that this one has a  little bit more of a kind of sport anger
0FWyynApqp8,1738799,1744880,to it  uh as it bugatti suggests it does with  the name pure sport and with all the  changes they've made to make it more
0FWyynApqp8,1744880,1750799,handling focused and so  that's the bugatti chiron pure sport
0FWyynApqp8,1750799,1758159,this car shares a lot with the regular  shiron and frankly with the bugatti devo  but that's fine with me because those
0FWyynApqp8,1758159,1763360,are two of the most amazing cars i've  ever driven and so is this one beautiful
0FWyynApqp8,1763360,1769039,car unbelievable craftsmanship fantastic  technology amazing performance and now
0FWyynApqp8,1769039,1774559,it's time to give the pure sport a doug  score
0FWyynApqp8,1776799,1783679,starting with the weekend categories and  styling the pure sport is obviously a  gorgeous car not perfect but very lovely  and it gets a 9 out of 10. acceleration
0FWyynApqp8,1783679,1790240,is insane and it gets a 10 out of 10.  handling is strong but like other  bugatti's not quite on the level of  precision and amazement as some other
0FWyynApqp8,1790240,1796159,insane hyper cars and it gets a 9 out of  10. fun factor is as good as it gets 10  out of 10 and obviously the same with
0FWyynApqp8,1796159,1801679,cool factor these are insanely cool and  head turning and it gets a 10 out of 10  for a total weekend score of 48 out of
0FWyynApqp8,1801679,1807200,50. next up are the daily categories and  features this car has some great stuff  though not all the top modern tech no
0FWyynApqp8,1807200,1812880,surprise and it gets a 6 out of 10.  comfort is excellent for a car like this  and it gets a 5 out of 10. quality is
0FWyynApqp8,1812880,1819200,fantastic for a supercar but reliability  is a bit of a question and it gets a 7  out of 10. practicality is low not only
0FWyynApqp8,1819200,1825440,is it only 2 seats and very small in a  cargo area but it's so expensive it's  just hard to practically drive it
0FWyynApqp8,1825440,1830640,anywhere and it gets a one out of ten  finally value and it's insanely  expensive but it's also one of the great
0FWyynApqp8,1830640,1837440,performance cars of all time and it gets  a 6 out of 10 for a total daily score of  25 out of 50. added up in the doug score
0FWyynApqp8,1837440,1843760,is 73 out of 100 which places it here  against rival hyper cars i've tested  truthfully i don't see much difference
0FWyynApqp8,1843760,1849679,here between this the regular shiron and  the devo they're all great but they're  all very similar the pure sport seems
0FWyynApqp8,1849679,1855039,like it's essentially devo handling and  driving experience with shiron's styling  and frankly that might be the best of
0FWyynApqp8,1855039,1861429,all worlds  [Music]
0FWyynApqp8,1864320,1866398,you
