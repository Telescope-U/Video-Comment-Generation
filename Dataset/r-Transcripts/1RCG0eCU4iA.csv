1RCG0eCU4iA,0,1360,these are not the worst players in the
1RCG0eCU4iA,1360,3679,nba they just disappointed us the most
1RCG0eCU4iA,3679,5279,here are seven stars who heavily
1RCG0eCU4iA,5279,9679,underperformed in the 2022 nba playoffs
1RCG0eCU4iA,9679,12000,deangelo russell for the first time in
1RCG0eCU4iA,12000,13679,franchise history the minnesota
1RCG0eCU4iA,13679,15759,timberwolves had a big three or so they
1RCG0eCU4iA,15759,17600,thought young anthony edwards and karl
1RCG0eCU4iA,17600,19520,anthony towns played very well in the
1RCG0eCU4iA,19520,21680,playoffs against memphis and at moments
1RCG0eCU4iA,21680,23600,it's fair to say they were spectacular
1RCG0eCU4iA,23600,25840,edwards averaged 25 points in his first
1RCG0eCU4iA,25840,28480,playoff appearance shooting over 40 from
1RCG0eCU4iA,28480,31760,three cad averaged 22 and 10 shooting 45
1RCG0eCU4iA,31760,33760,from three and further making the case
1RCG0eCU4iA,33760,35600,as the best shooting center of all time
1RCG0eCU4iA,35600,37280,however the last part of their big three
1RCG0eCU4iA,37280,39680,was mia d'angelo russell averaged just
1RCG0eCU4iA,39680,42640,12 points per game on a horrendous 33
1RCG0eCU4iA,42640,44559,shooting in the deciding game six the
1RCG0eCU4iA,44559,46559,timberwolves coach bench deangelo in the
1RCG0eCU4iA,46559,48320,fourth quarter and we can hardly blame
1RCG0eCU4iA,48320,50000,him russell couldn't buy a bucket and
1RCG0eCU4iA,50000,51840,was a non-factor on the defensive end
1RCG0eCU4iA,51840,54160,his future in minnesota seems extremely
1RCG0eCU4iA,54160,56160,uncertain donovan mitchell
1RCG0eCU4iA,56160,58399,for a player with supreme athleticism
1RCG0eCU4iA,58399,60320,extremely long arms and quick feet
1RCG0eCU4iA,60320,62399,donovan mitchell is a horrible defender
1RCG0eCU4iA,62399,64158,he's been a subpar defender his whole
1RCG0eCU4iA,64158,66240,career but his lack of defensive effort
1RCG0eCU4iA,66240,68240,has been masked by his great offensive
1RCG0eCU4iA,68240,70640,output but not in the 2022 playoffs the
1RCG0eCU4iA,70640,72560,utah jazz lost the series against the
1RCG0eCU4iA,72560,74720,mavs who had no business winning two
1RCG0eCU4iA,74720,76320,games without their best and most
1RCG0eCU4iA,76320,78479,important player but they did thanks to
1RCG0eCU4iA,78479,80159,the worst perimeter defense we've seen
1RCG0eCU4iA,80159,82080,in these playoffs utah's guards and
1RCG0eCU4iA,82080,83600,wings looked like they couldn't contain
1RCG0eCU4iA,83600,85759,a grandma strolling through the park let
1RCG0eCU4iA,85759,87360,alone jaylen brunson and spencer
1RCG0eCU4iA,87360,89200,dinwiddie driving towards the rim their
1RCG0eCU4iA,89200,91280,defense collapsed too early and too
1RCG0eCU4iA,91280,93439,often leaving the poor rudy gobert to
1RCG0eCU4iA,93439,95439,either leave a wide open dunk or a wide
1RCG0eCU4iA,95439,97360,open three naturally he stayed in the
1RCG0eCU4iA,97360,99680,paint and then rotated to the open 3 but
1RCG0eCU4iA,99680,102240,it was useless in game 2 the mavs made a
1RCG0eCU4iA,102240,105200,franchise record 22 3s and of those 22
1RCG0eCU4iA,105200,108159,makes 17 were uncontested the most by
1RCG0eCU4iA,108159,110320,any team in the history of the nba
1RCG0eCU4iA,110320,112479,offensively donovan had high scoring
1RCG0eCU4iA,112479,114799,games and he did average 25 points in
1RCG0eCU4iA,114799,116960,the series but he was often forcing it
1RCG0eCU4iA,116960,118560,too many times he dribbled the ball for
1RCG0eCU4iA,118560,120399,the entire possession and jacked up
1RCG0eCU4iA,120399,122640,tough uncontested jumpers spider shot
1RCG0eCU4iA,122640,126000,just 39 from the field and a terrible 20
1RCG0eCU4iA,126000,128160,from three in the past mitchell proved
1RCG0eCU4iA,128160,130000,that he can be a capable playmaker in
1RCG0eCU4iA,130000,131760,the pick-and-roll but in these playoffs
1RCG0eCU4iA,131760,133680,we saw very little of his passing what
1RCG0eCU4iA,133680,135599,was especially painful to watch was his
1RCG0eCU4iA,135599,137760,on-court relationship with gobert rudy
1RCG0eCU4iA,137760,139599,is far from a great post scorer but
1RCG0eCU4iA,139599,141520,donovan often didn't pass him the ball
1RCG0eCU4iA,141520,143680,when gobert was wide open for a dunk we
1RCG0eCU4iA,143680,145680,expected another leap from donovan after
1RCG0eCU4iA,145680,148000,he shined in the 2020 playoffs but he
1RCG0eCU4iA,148000,150000,regressed and is arguably one of the
1RCG0eCU4iA,150000,152239,most overrated superstars in the nba
1RCG0eCU4iA,152239,154959,today james harden hardin's left drives
1RCG0eCU4iA,154959,156800,to the basket used to be one of the most
1RCG0eCU4iA,156800,159040,unstoppable offensive moves in the nba
1RCG0eCU4iA,159040,160560,and there are multiple reasons why
1RCG0eCU4iA,160560,162640,harden was so effective supreme ball
1RCG0eCU4iA,162640,164480,control and silky dribbling haired with
1RCG0eCU4iA,164480,166239,exceptional strength low center of
1RCG0eCU4iA,166239,168319,gravity and an elite first step allowed
1RCG0eCU4iA,168319,169920,harden to create an advantage against
1RCG0eCU4iA,169920,171920,pretty much anybody james's playmaking
1RCG0eCU4iA,171920,173840,mastery and the tendency to find an open
1RCG0eCU4iA,173840,175680,three-point shooter limited the amount
1RCG0eCU4iA,175680,177440,of help the defenses could provide on
1RCG0eCU4iA,177440,179440,his drives and if all else failed he
1RCG0eCU4iA,179440,181440,could take his patented step back threes
1RCG0eCU4iA,181440,183599,or initiate contact to draw the foul
1RCG0eCU4iA,183599,185599,hardin's left drive was such a powerful
1RCG0eCU4iA,185599,187360,weapon that it guaranteed a playoff
1RCG0eCU4iA,187360,189120,berth and at least a couple of wins in
1RCG0eCU4iA,189120,191120,the playoffs that is simply not the case
1RCG0eCU4iA,191120,193440,anymore hardin's first step disappeared
1RCG0eCU4iA,193440,195599,for the majority of the 2022 season
1RCG0eCU4iA,195599,197519,james couldn't get past his defender his
1RCG0eCU4iA,197519,199360,step back 3 was not falling and his
1RCG0eCU4iA,199360,200959,effective field goal percentage dropped
1RCG0eCU4iA,200959,202239,by 7
1RCG0eCU4iA,202239,204239,however the beard is still a top-notch
1RCG0eCU4iA,204239,206239,playmaker hardin's ability to push the
1RCG0eCU4iA,206239,208000,ball through a forest of hands into the
1RCG0eCU4iA,208000,210239,narrowest of spaces is at the very top
1RCG0eCU4iA,210239,211920,of the league and he showcased his
1RCG0eCU4iA,211920,213599,splendid passing in the series against
1RCG0eCU4iA,213599,215920,the raptors where he dissected toronto's
1RCG0eCU4iA,215920,218400,defense with 10 assists per game however
1RCG0eCU4iA,218400,220159,in the second round against the heat in
1RCG0eCU4iA,220159,222239,the absence of joel embiid his scoring
1RCG0eCU4iA,222239,224319,was desperately needed but hardin wasn't
1RCG0eCU4iA,224319,226080,able to deliver and the problem was not
1RCG0eCU4iA,226080,228000,missing shots but how passive and
1RCG0eCU4iA,228000,230000,harmless he was offensively hardened was
1RCG0eCU4iA,230000,232000,neutered by jimmy butler and he had only
1RCG0eCU4iA,232000,233680,two shot attempts in the second half of
1RCG0eCU4iA,233680,235519,the deciding game six throughout the
1RCG0eCU4iA,235519,237760,series james averaged only 12 shot
1RCG0eCU4iA,237760,239840,attempts per game and hit only 40
1RCG0eCU4iA,239840,242000,percent of them at the age of 33 he
1RCG0eCU4iA,242000,243680,showed a worrisome lack of burst and
1RCG0eCU4iA,243680,245599,declining athleticism will he ever get
1RCG0eCU4iA,245599,247120,back to the high scoring james harden
1RCG0eCU4iA,247120,249680,from houston trey young when a superstar
1RCG0eCU4iA,249680,251519,plays for a mediocre team that barely
1RCG0eCU4iA,251519,253599,made the playoffs nobody expects him to
1RCG0eCU4iA,253599,255760,advance past the number one seed however
1RCG0eCU4iA,255760,257519,nobody expects him to look completely
1RCG0eCU4iA,257519,260079,harmless either in the 2021 playoffs
1RCG0eCU4iA,260079,262079,trae young was one of the biggest stars
1RCG0eCU4iA,262079,265120,averaging 29 points and 9.5 assists per
1RCG0eCU4iA,265120,267520,game in the 2022 playoffs he played
1RCG0eCU4iA,267520,269280,perhaps the five worst games of his
1RCG0eCU4iA,269280,271919,career young made only 22 field goals in
1RCG0eCU4iA,271919,273759,the entire series against the heat with
1RCG0eCU4iA,273759,276080,the abysmal shooting of 31 from the
1RCG0eCU4iA,276080,278880,field and 18 from three he averaged a
1RCG0eCU4iA,278880,281040,measly 15 points per game and had the
1RCG0eCU4iA,281040,283360,same number of assists as turnovers in
1RCG0eCU4iA,283360,285440,the 76 games he played in the regular
1RCG0eCU4iA,285440,287520,season trey had only one game where he
1RCG0eCU4iA,287520,289759,scored less than 13 points in the series
1RCG0eCU4iA,289759,291680,against the heat he had three with their
1RCG0eCU4iA,291680,293759,best player in terrible form the hawks
1RCG0eCU4iA,293759,295520,didn't stand a chance big credit to
1RCG0eCU4iA,295520,297680,miami's defense who had done a brilliant
1RCG0eCU4iA,297680,299680,job on young trey's killer three-point
1RCG0eCU4iA,299680,301360,shooting floaters and slash and kick
1RCG0eCU4iA,301360,303120,game is the driving force behind the
1RCG0eCU4iA,303120,305039,atlanta offense heath's coach eric
1RCG0eCU4iA,305039,307280,spoelstra knew that to stop the hawks he
1RCG0eCU4iA,307280,308880,needed to stop young's pick-and-roll
1RCG0eCU4iA,308880,311840,wizardry bam adebayo jimmy butler and pj
1RCG0eCU4iA,311840,313680,tucker all aggressively switched onto
1RCG0eCU4iA,313680,315600,trey they completely took away his
1RCG0eCU4iA,315600,317440,drives to the basket and forced him to
1RCG0eCU4iA,317440,319600,take tough contested jumpers young said
1RCG0eCU4iA,319600,321120,that he hasn't been defended like that
1RCG0eCU4iA,321120,322800,since high school and he couldn't find a
1RCG0eCU4iA,322800,324800,way to unlock the heat's defense trey
1RCG0eCU4iA,324800,326639,looked so overwhelmed and helpless and
1RCG0eCU4iA,326639,328080,it's fair to say he played the worst
1RCG0eCU4iA,328080,329840,stretch of basketball of his four-year
1RCG0eCU4iA,329840,331600,career to be fair trey's main
1RCG0eCU4iA,331600,333600,pick-and-roll partner clint capela was
1RCG0eCU4iA,333600,335600,out for almost the entire series while
1RCG0eCU4iA,335600,337280,collins and bogdanovic played through
1RCG0eCU4iA,337280,339360,injury even at full strength the hawks
1RCG0eCU4iA,339360,341039,were a heavy underdog and it would be a
1RCG0eCU4iA,341039,342960,miracle if they advanced instead of
1RCG0eCU4iA,342960,344639,constantly playing with the ball trey
1RCG0eCU4iA,344639,346240,should take a page out of steph curry's
1RCG0eCU4iA,346240,348160,playbook he needs to play more as a spot
1RCG0eCU4iA,348160,350160,up shooter running through screens and
1RCG0eCU4iA,350160,352240,be involved in more handoff actions this
1RCG0eCU4iA,352240,354160,would make atlanta's game plan much more
1RCG0eCU4iA,354160,356160,varied and unpredictable and it would be
1RCG0eCU4iA,356160,358080,harder for defenses to guard him young
1RCG0eCU4iA,358080,359759,and the hawks got a lesson from the heat
1RCG0eCU4iA,359759,361199,now it remains to be seen if they will
1RCG0eCU4iA,361199,363600,learn anything from it chris paul when
1RCG0eCU4iA,363600,365759,he's playing well he's a point god and
1RCG0eCU4iA,365759,367520,when he's not nobody is saying anything
1RCG0eCU4iA,367520,369759,to him why not patrick beverly heavily
1RCG0eCU4iA,369759,371520,criticized chris paul during his guest
1RCG0eCU4iA,371520,373600,appearance on espn and despite the
1RCG0eCU4iA,373600,375600,obvious rivalry between them we have to
1RCG0eCU4iA,375600,377199,admit that he was kind of right chris
1RCG0eCU4iA,377199,379039,paul did play like a point god in the
1RCG0eCU4iA,379039,380639,first round of the playoffs against new
1RCG0eCU4iA,380639,382479,orleans after devin booker got injured
1RCG0eCU4iA,382479,385600,in game two cp3 single-handedly won game
1RCG0eCU4iA,385600,387440,three with 19 points in the fourth
1RCG0eCU4iA,387440,389199,quarter finishing the game with 28
1RCG0eCU4iA,389199,392080,points 14 assists and zero turnovers in
1RCG0eCU4iA,392080,394319,the deciding game six he was perfect
1RCG0eCU4iA,394319,396240,literally paul led the sons to victory
1RCG0eCU4iA,396240,398960,with 33 points on 14 for 14 shooting
1RCG0eCU4iA,398960,400720,from the field plus four for four from
1RCG0eCU4iA,400720,402800,the foul line it was an nba playoff
1RCG0eCU4iA,402800,404720,record for most points without a miss
1RCG0eCU4iA,404720,406479,and paul was one of the best performers
1RCG0eCU4iA,406479,408160,in the first round of the playoffs in
1RCG0eCU4iA,408160,410000,the second round against the mavs paul
1RCG0eCU4iA,410000,411759,and the suns got to a great start they
1RCG0eCU4iA,411759,414000,took a 2-0 series lead with cp3
1RCG0eCU4iA,414000,416400,orchestrating the offense averaging 23
1RCG0eCU4iA,416400,419840,points on 60 shooting then abomination
1RCG0eCU4iA,419840,421919,in the final five games of the series he
1RCG0eCU4iA,421919,424080,was held to 13 points or fewer and
1RCG0eCU4iA,424080,426479,turned the ball over 3.6 times per game
1RCG0eCU4iA,426479,428800,with less than six assists per contest
1RCG0eCU4iA,428800,430319,we wonder if he was injured because
1RCG0eCU4iA,430319,431919,that's the only thing that would explain
1RCG0eCU4iA,431919,434160,such a huge drop-off in performance we
1RCG0eCU4iA,434160,436560,understand that cp3 is 37 years old but
1RCG0eCU4iA,436560,438400,he has a long history of big playoff
1RCG0eCU4iA,438400,440479,flops and because they got blown out so
1RCG0eCU4iA,440479,442479,badly on their home court this one left
1RCG0eCU4iA,442479,444400,arguably the worst aftertaste of them
1RCG0eCU4iA,444400,446960,all kevin durant and kyrie irving at the
1RCG0eCU4iA,446960,449120,start of the 2022 nba season the
1RCG0eCU4iA,449120,450880,bookmakers gave the brooklyn nets the
1RCG0eCU4iA,450880,452400,best chance of winning the title and
1RCG0eCU4iA,452400,454319,before the start of the playoffs despite
1RCG0eCU4iA,454319,456639,all the injuries kyrie's absence losing
1RCG0eCU4iA,456639,458800,james harden and ben simmons sitting out
1RCG0eCU4iA,458800,460400,the nets were still considered one of
1RCG0eCU4iA,460400,462080,the main favorites the biggest reason
1RCG0eCU4iA,462080,464080,for that was kevin durant in the 55
1RCG0eCU4iA,464080,466080,regular season games he played durant
1RCG0eCU4iA,466080,467840,looked like the best player in the nba
1RCG0eCU4iA,467840,470720,with kd in the lineup the nets won 65 of
1RCG0eCU4iA,470720,472319,their games which would be enough for
1RCG0eCU4iA,472319,474240,first place in the east without him they
1RCG0eCU4iA,474240,476639,won only 29 which would rank near the
1RCG0eCU4iA,476639,478319,bottom of the league katie was dropping
1RCG0eCU4iA,478319,480479,buckets on everybody using his masterful
1RCG0eCU4iA,480479,482319,isolation skills to win games for the
1RCG0eCU4iA,482319,483840,nets but against boston the
1RCG0eCU4iA,483840,486080,quote-unquote best scorer in the game
1RCG0eCU4iA,486080,487919,stopped scoring the celtics pushed him
1RCG0eCU4iA,487919,489759,around blocked his movement and didn't
1RCG0eCU4iA,489759,491759,allow him to get to the ball when he did
1RCG0eCU4iA,491759,493360,have it they swarmed him with multiple
1RCG0eCU4iA,493360,495599,defenders he played extremely poorly in
1RCG0eCU4iA,495599,497599,the first game and was close to useless
1RCG0eCU4iA,497599,499360,in games two and three the nets tried to
1RCG0eCU4iA,499360,501199,get him open with pinned down screens
1RCG0eCU4iA,501199,503599,post-ups a lot of isolation but nothing
1RCG0eCU4iA,503599,505520,worked every celtics player was his
1RCG0eCU4iA,505520,507440,primary defender at one time even the
1RCG0eCU4iA,507440,509280,small peyton prichard guarded him for a
1RCG0eCU4iA,509280,511919,few possessions by rotating guys on kd
1RCG0eCU4iA,511919,514000,nobody on the celtics got tired durant
1RCG0eCU4iA,514000,515599,tried to figure out scoring strategies
1RCG0eCU4iA,515599,517440,against so many different coverages and
1RCG0eCU4iA,517440,519200,was aggressive enough in game four but
1RCG0eCU4iA,519200,521120,it was too late the celtics swept the
1RCG0eCU4iA,521120,522959,nets and katie had the worst shooting
1RCG0eCU4iA,522959,525120,performance of his career for the series
1RCG0eCU4iA,525120,528320,he made only 38 of his shots and 33
1RCG0eCU4iA,528320,530240,behind the arc was katie struggling
1RCG0eCU4iA,530240,532320,kyrie irving's mediocre performance flew
1RCG0eCU4iA,532320,534640,under the radar kyrie was spectacular in
1RCG0eCU4iA,534640,536320,game one almost winning the game by
1RCG0eCU4iA,536320,538800,himself with 39 points but after that he
1RCG0eCU4iA,538800,540480,played uninspired basketball for the
1RCG0eCU4iA,540480,542800,rest of the series averaging just 15
1RCG0eCU4iA,542800,544720,points in the next three games despite
1RCG0eCU4iA,544720,546160,the common belief that the net's role
1RCG0eCU4iA,546160,547680,players didn't play well enough it
1RCG0eCU4iA,547680,549519,wasn't the case nobody except blake
1RCG0eCU4iA,549519,551519,griffin shot below 55
1RCG0eCU4iA,551519,553200,and other than drummond and claxton's
1RCG0eCU4iA,553200,554720,troubles from the free throw line they
1RCG0eCU4iA,554720,556800,all played as expected or even better
1RCG0eCU4iA,556800,558560,it's true that boston had the number one
1RCG0eCU4iA,558560,560560,defense in the nba but jimmy butler
1RCG0eCU4iA,560560,562640,played spectacularly against the same
1RCG0eCU4iA,562640,564240,team this only means that katie and
1RCG0eCU4iA,564240,566080,kyrie underperformed and are the first
1RCG0eCU4iA,566080,570279,to blame for the nets getting swept
