sEmZIi_0Kj8,6055,12340,The thing about Self-Discipline is that  it is necessary for every thing you do in your life
sEmZIi_0Kj8,12365,19142,"you have to be self-disciplined.  Working out, working out you gotta work out every day"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,19167,27943,"you gotta stay in shape, if you wanna... I mean, if you don't stay in shape you die.  When I'm working out I always do one extra rep, one extra set"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,27967,33776,"because it, it's a promise I kept to my self.  But, but working out might have be a priority for every single day"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,33800,42115,"because you got things going on in your business world and with your family and all that.  So, guess what, itâ€™s a priority for my life, so I do it in the morning before my day even starts."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,42560,48417,If you change your mindset  and really focus it on what discipline really is.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,48441,53798,"You start to welcome discipline, you welcome self-discipline into your life"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,54059,62629,"And here's the biggest thing, it's a pattern.  It's a pattern I keep of me.  I always do a little extra, I always go an extra inch."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,62653,68763,"And the quickest and easiest place to do it is the gym.  Because I can always grab one more weight, one more set"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,68787,74857,and look what it does? It shifts your identity.  The benefit of discipline in my eyes has always been
sEmZIi_0Kj8,74882,80040,that through discipline I get things done.  I do it in the morning before my day even starts
sEmZIi_0Kj8,80064,85913,"so I can still handle the priorities for the day, but I got my workout done.  So long-term, I look up in a year"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,85937,92072,and I'm not out of shape and breathing hard when I go up the stairs  Because I maintain that discipline on a daily basis.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,95746,100635,Most people go through life never discovering what their talents are
sEmZIi_0Kj8,100786,108610,"Most people never develop their talents.  You need to tell you, no more snacks, no more desserts, no more TV"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,108634,115704,"no more. No, we working out now.  You have skills and abilities, but if you don't nurture them"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,115728,122973,"if you don't develop them they will never serve you.  Your gifts can take you many places, if you develop your gifts."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,122997,130655,The best gifts come from the bottom.  I value myself enough to give 120% or don't do it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,130679,136647,And that if you decide that my life deserves my developing  this what I do well.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,136671,144337,Why are you only giving 50% what's wrong with you?  I grant you that if you begin to work to develop your gifts
sEmZIi_0Kj8,144480,151320,"you'll develop a strong sense of happiness, you'll get a larger vision of yourself  Because part of beginning to get a larger vision of yourself"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,151344,156549,all of us need some area of our lives where we can have a feeling of competence.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,156970,165231,When other folks are having a good time  you've got to have the strength of character.  You need to tell you that you owe you something
sEmZIi_0Kj8,166627,172389,as you begin to develop and expand your skills and your talents  and your vision of yourself
sEmZIi_0Kj8,173000,178618,You will always be in control  of your destiny.  I want freedom.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,178642,182673,And for me disciplining myself means more freedom.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,188014,194505,"It's so easy to be great nowadays.  Because everybody else is, most people are weak."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,194608,204250,"This- this is a softened generation.  So if you have any mental toughness  any, any ability, you have any fraction of self-discipline."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,204329,212375,The ability to not want to do it but still do it  People have a hard- thing- understand I hate to run
sEmZIi_0Kj8,212558,218661,"and what makes me so crazy it doesn't need more  people go ""why do you run if you hate it?"""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,218685,224486,"What are you talking about?  I don't want to take showers and eat either, I hate that too."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,224510,231438,"The whole, that's life man.  That, and it wasn't until I changed that mentality"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,231462,241373,"That I became somebody.  I hated going to school, so guess what I was dumb.  But if you can get through to doing things that you hate to do"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,241634,248976,"on the other side is greatness.  That's what people don't understand  by me running, I'm callusing my mind."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,249001,257062,"I'm not training for a race, I'm training for life  I'm training for the time when I get that two o'clock in the morning call"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,257087,263133,that my mom is dead or something happens tragic in life  I don't fall apart.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,263355,268607,"I'm training my mind and my body and my spirit, so it's all one.  So I can handle what life is gonna throw at me"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,268632,276313,"because the life I've lived, it throws a whole bunch at you.  And if you're not physically and mentally prepared for that"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,276614,279662,you're just gonna crumble and you're good for nobody.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,281797,288011,99% of people are not willing to do what it takes
sEmZIi_0Kj8,288035,295033,"to make their dreams come true.  The Marines have a saying ""Everybody wants to go to heaven"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,295057,300953,"but nobody wants to die""  The center of bringing any dream into fruition"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,300977,306992,is self-discipline.  You know something as simple as food and eating
sEmZIi_0Kj8,307016,312262,is not about your body as much as it is about your mind.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,312287,320159,It's getting command of your mind  to be able to choose actions that are in your own best interest.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,320183,326443,Every day we are choosing stuff  that's not in our own best interest.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,326468,332349,So if the world is attacking you and the world wants to fight you  and the world's trying to hold you down.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,332374,339651,So you gonna kick yourself in the balls  So you gonna stop yourself from getting what you dream?
sEmZIi_0Kj8,340207,347365,And I think the word DISCIPLINE has kind of gotten a bad name  we think about it in terms of punishment.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,347389,354031,"I'm not, I'm not talking about discipline in that way.  I'm talking about discipline in the sense that you"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,354056,363754,you forego immediate pleasure  for the exchange of long term self-respect.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,364991,372323,I believe that self-discipline  is the definition of self-love.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,372569,379909,That when you say that you love yourself  that means that you have behavior towards yourself
sEmZIi_0Kj8,380028,388480,that is loving.  Self-discipline is the center of all material success.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,388837,396210,You cannot win the war against the world  if you can't win the war against your own mind.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,401065,409706,"Self-love is when you say to yourself  ""Man look, I know you and that girl got a real connection"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,410523,419916,"I know y'all vibe but that's your girl's cousin  so I love you too much to let you do that."""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,420567,427479,"it's like you say to yourself ""man look,  I know you want to eat that pizza and it'll be really good"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,427503,433399,you know but I can't let you eat that man  because if you eat that pizza you gonna feel like crap
sEmZIi_0Kj8,433510,445141,"you know and I, I just I love you too much to let you eat that""  Self-love is ""Eh look, I know you got a test on Monday, you know"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,445166,451300,and I know you really want to go out with your friends  it's Saturday night you want to go out but if you fail that test
sEmZIi_0Kj8,451324,458070,"you're not gonna feel good about yourself  you know I just I love you too much to let you go out tonight."""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,458234,466736,Self-discipline is self-love.  If you wanna be happy you have to love yourself
sEmZIi_0Kj8,466823,475519,which means you have to discipline your behavior.  The road to sustained happiness
sEmZIi_0Kj8,475543,485463,is through disciplining your behavior.  We tend to base our self-esteem on what other people think
sEmZIi_0Kj8,485756,493121,and that's not really self-esteem.  Self-esteem is supposed to be how we feel about ourselves
sEmZIi_0Kj8,493145,503136,and I was just saying how dangerous it is  to allow other people to determine how you're gonna feel about you.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,503667,511578,And it's kind of like looking into a broken mirror  you're gonna look at a broken mirror and then change your face
sEmZIi_0Kj8,511603,517063,to try to look good in this defiled busted broken mirror.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,517491,527425,And it- it's just other people's opinions  is a really bad way to determine how we feel about ourselves.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,536986,543247,Life can be brutal.  Life can be unforgiving.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,544604,550873,If I had to sum up in one word  the difference between the greats and the average
sEmZIi_0Kj8,550897,561481,"the difference between the successful and the nobodies of the world  One word, one attribute to describe the difference"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,562513,569179,Discipline.  If you don't have the discipline  you can forget about the trophy.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,569274,574408,"You can forget about the success, the greatness.  All champions have discipline."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,575162,578368,It's the discipline to work hard.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,581185,586843,"You know, not when everyone is watching  but when no one is watching."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,587073,593121,When the fans aren't there.  When the coach isn't there.  When it's just you and your character.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,595080,600753,The discipline to eat strong healthy foods  when you have other tempting options.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,601150,607402,When those around you might not be so strong.  The discipline to say no
sEmZIi_0Kj8,607727,610734,when those around you choose to be average.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,617234,624360,The discipline to keep going when it hurts  because life doesn't give you what you want
sEmZIi_0Kj8,624384,630090,it gives you what you deserve.  And if you haven't work for it
sEmZIi_0Kj8,630343,637200,if you haven't sacrificed for it.  If you haven't given your all  then you don't deserve it
sEmZIi_0Kj8,637224,644048,and you won't get it.  Push through the pain on the other side is growth.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,644952,652910,"When pain comes, that means it's time to show character.  Show me your character"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,653221,661545,"remain disciplined, stay strong.  When it all seems hopeless keep plugging away."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,661878,667551,Nothing can stop you if you don't stop for anything.  Don't stop for anything!
sEmZIi_0Kj8,668011,673795,Never break your discipline.  Remain faithful to yourself and your vision.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,674526,680302,When it gets painful push harder  push through the pain.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,680627,686270,You gotta have the discipline to do 11 when your opponent stops at 10.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,686754,693584,The discipline to keep going when it hurts  because life doesn't give you what you want
sEmZIi_0Kj8,693609,700861,it gives you what you deserve.  And if you haven't worked for it  if you haven't sacrificed for it
sEmZIi_0Kj8,701037,707552,if you haven't given your all  then you don't deserve it  and you won't get it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,709456,715519,"Show your character  remain disciplined, stay strong"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,716875,722637,"don't say ""why the pain?"" don't say ""why me?""  Say ""try me!"""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,722731,728097,"Say ""is that all you've got?""  Give me more, keep plugging away."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,728192,734969,When there seems to be no hope of victory.  When you don't see the results
sEmZIi_0Kj8,735286,740381,"hang in there, be strong, be brave, remain disciplined"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,742976,748134,And your time will come.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,755609,761441,I was weighing like 297 pounds.  And I had to make a change in my life.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,761465,767900,"You know, I was at an all-time low  and I wasn't going anywhere.  And I was exactly what everybody said I was gonna be"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,767924,774519,which was nothing  This man is a self-made beast.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,775829,783312,Widely considered to be the toughest man on the planet  and one of the greatest endurance athletes of all time.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,784002,790549,"I was just an insecure, scared kid  and the only way I could find myself"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,791120,799770,was to put myself through the worst thing possible.  He's the only member of the US Armed Forces to complete SEAL training
sEmZIi_0Kj8,799794,804929,the US Army Ranger School  and the Air Force tactical air controller training.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,805634,812238,He has completed the infamous destroyer of men known as Hell Week  three times including two in a single year
sEmZIi_0Kj8,812262,818444,and one that he started and finished with multiple stress fractures and a hernia.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,819119,825428,No one was here to help me  and the feeling I had every morning  I started shaving my hair when I was 16 years old.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,825515,831918,And the feeling I had every morning I looked in the mirror was horrible  and I didn't wanna feel like that anymore.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,831943,838712,"And how I felt was a kid going nowhere, a kid that was scared  and most kids will accept that and look for help"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,838736,844552,but the best thing that happened to me no one helped me.  He served in combat in Iraq
sEmZIi_0Kj8,844577,852900,was the bodyguard for the Iraqi Prime Minister.  He once held the Guinness World Record for most pull-ups in 24 hours at 4030.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,853178,861431,"No one felt sorry for me.  No one looked at me and said like this day and age  they'll, they'll take you in and they'll tell everybody stop picking on this person"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,861542,868184,back then they didn't care.  I had to build calluses in my brain  the same way I built calluses on my hands.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,868209,873716,So I broke the Guinness World Records for pull-ups a long time ago  but I failed at it twice.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,873740,881278,"And I did 67,000 pull-ups in trying to break this record.  So to do 4030 pull-ups"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,881302,889888,"I had to do 67,000 for training for that.  He has run eight, eight consecutive 100-mile races"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,889912,896237,"over eight back-to-back weekends.  He ran over 7,000 miles in a single year"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,896261,900975,and that is the equivalent of running 267 marathons.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,902395,910990,"I saw myself as the weakest person God ever created.  You had to have a goal.  My goal was, the only person that's gonna turn this person around is me."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,911069,918163,The only way I get turned around  is put myself through the worst things possible a human being can ever endure
sEmZIi_0Kj8,918226,924121,And that would be the only way that I can build this brain  to handle anything that comes in front of it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,924146,927558,Callusing my mind through pain and suffering.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,933756,942207,The only way you're ever going to get to the other side of this journey  is you have got to suffer to grow.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,942492,948221,To grow you must suffer.  I'm afraid of my shadow
sEmZIi_0Kj8,948442,956894,"how can I overcome that?  Go in the Military, get your butt kicked.  do things you hate to do, be uncomfortable every day of your life."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,956918,962376,Roger that.  I'm not the smartest kid in the world  okay? Is there somebody saying
sEmZIi_0Kj8,962401,968535,"""Oh, no you're smart. No, no don't say that to yourself""  I said to myself ""No, I'm dumb""  Okay, roger that"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,968559,976019,"How do you get smarter? Educate yourself.  So the things that we run from, we running from the truth."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,976503,982922,"We're running from the truth, man  So the only way I became successful, was going towards the truth."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,982946,988120,As painful and as brutal as it is  it changed me.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,988144,993024,"It allowed me to become, in my own right, who I am today."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,995810,1000785,If you can for the rest of your life live inside of yourself
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1001539,1006840,"Stop listening to people who are calling you fat, gay, transsexual  everything that is makes no sense."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1006864,1014553,All these insecure people putting their insecurities on you  you gotta flush it out.  You gotta just be whoever the hell God or whatever the hell you believe in
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1014577,1020378,"If you believe in nothing but yourself, I don't care what it is.  You're gotta take everything and throw it away."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1020878,1024455,You have to believe in one thing and that is yourself.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1032032,1038143,Around 97% of students are distracted by cell phones.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1039381,1042825,Are you a part of that 97%?
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1044459,1049468,When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1049737,1055070,then you'll be successful.  Whether your distractions are text messages
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1055096,1060300,Checking emails  Surfing the web  Playing games
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1060325,1066426,or scrolling through social media.  The fact remains that it is a distraction.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1066451,1073084,"I'm saying to you today that there's some of you  if you give up your cell phone, you would be successful."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1074187,1081718,But your cell phone is more important to you than your success.  Stop wasting time on your cell phone.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1081743,1087312,Facebook isn't going anywhere.  Instagram will still be here this weekend.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1087843,1095270,"Focus on your dreams, focus on your studies  focus on your goals and aspirations."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1097190,1102419,"Put the thing down.  Look up, you missing stuff."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1102776,1108847,"What is the long-term effect of too much information?  We don't know, but we're finding out."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1109719,1118877,Focus on becoming a better you.  A better you that is not distracted by unnecessary things.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1119170,1125423,"You gotta cut off the cell phone, you got it no TV.  There were those of you who were watching the game last night."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1125669,1131635,You really didn't have no business watching these boys  win a national title  going to the NBA and making millions.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1131660,1139429,You didn't have no business watching them.  Because you're not where you need to be.  One that is determined to succeed and not scroll
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1139453,1146770,that is determined to prosper and not post  to grow all day and not game all day.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1147016,1150388,Stop wasting time on your cell phone.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1152626,1159174,And when you get to the point  where all you wanna do is be successful as bad as you wanna breathe
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1159483,1165666,then you'll be successful.  It's about you and your future.  It's about your grades.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1165690,1170840,"It's about your dreams.  Ultimately, it's about your life."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1171300,1176180,The time you spend on your cell phone could be used for your success.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1176616,1181901,"The time you could be using to be successful, you're using on the cell."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1182440,1190931,"And the cell phone is not bringing you nothing but a bill.  Is your life more important than that app, then that game, that pulse."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1190955,1197953,"I need cell phones off, listen to me  Some of you are gonna be broke for the rest of your life  because that little thing on up on the side."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1198469,1204427,You're gonna be broke for the rest of your life because of a little cell phone.  We're so plugged into our cell phones
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1204562,1211005,that we become blind to the world around us.  And somebody has told you you couldn't live without it
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1211029,1217928,We can't take our eyes off the screen  long enough to see the beauty of the world around us.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1220919,1227609,It don't matter whose fault it is that something is broken  if it's your responsibility to fix it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1227633,1233823,For example it's- it's not somebody's fault if their father was an abusive alcoholic
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1233847,1241789,but it's for damn sure their responsibility to figure out  how they're gonna deal with those traumas and try to make a life out of it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1241814,1251798,It's not your fault if your partner cheated and ruined your marriage  but it is for damn sure your responsibility to figure out how to take that pain
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1251822,1256687,and how to overcome that and build a happy life for yourself.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1256885,1264639,"Fault and responsibility do not go together, it sucks  but they don't, when something is somebody's fault"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1264663,1272719,"we want them to suffer, we want them punished  we want them to pay  we want it to be their responsibility to fix it but"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1272766,1280789,"that's, that's not how it works especially when it's your heart.  Your heart, your life, your happiness"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1280814,1285360,is your responsibility and your responsibility alone.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1286249,1293945,"As long as we're pointing the finger  and, and stuck in who's fault something is"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1293970,1299834,we're jammed and trapped into victim mode.  When you're in victim mode you're stuck in suffering.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1299859,1307088,"The road to power is in taking responsibility.  Your heart, your life, your happiness"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1307374,1312199,is your responsibility and your responsibility alone.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1313198,1319054,"You can make a person smile, you can make a person feel good  you can make a person laugh"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1319086,1326887,but whether or not a person is happy  is deeply and totally and utterly out of your control.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1327926,1335702,The prerequisite for spending time with any person  is that they nourish and inspire you
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1335726,1345694,they feed your flame.  Look at your last 5 text messages  are those people feeding your flames or dousing your fire.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1346408,1352375,Put your phone down for just a second and look around  look to the people around you
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1354344,1359327,are those people throwing logs on your fire or are they pissing on it.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1367705,1374038,"I want my life, I want my- my work, my family  I want it to mean something."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1374062,1379506,"And it's like, it has, if you are not making someone else's life better"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1379530,1385243,then you're wasting your time.  The separation of talent and skill
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1385267,1390282,"is one of the, the greatest misunderstood concepts"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1390307,1400852,"for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams and want to do things.  Talent you have naturally  skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1401684,1406857,You don't try to build a wall.  You don't set out to build a wall.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1406881,1412618,"You donâ€™t say ""Iâ€™m going to build the biggest  baddest, greatest wall thatâ€™s ever been built."""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1412658,1420498,"You donâ€™t start there. You say  ""Iâ€™m gonna lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1420522,1426877,"there will not be one brick on the face of the earth  that's gonna be laid better than this brick  that I'm gonna lay in this next 10 minutes."""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1426902,1434226,And you do that every single day  - And soon you have a wall. - And soon you have a wall.  And I think psychologically
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1434401,1442235,"the advantage that, that gives me over- over  a lot of people that I have been in competition with in different situations"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1442259,1448298,"is, it's difficult to take the first step when you look how big the task is."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1454750,1463161,The definition of who I am is very clear to me  and it also redefines who I want to be
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1463827,1471176,In that I know for a fact  that I'm stronger than I thought I was.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1471200,1478834,"You know, you can't help but ask yourself the question  ""what would I do, if I was in Muhammad Ali's shoes?"""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1481921,1490713,I'm motivated by fear  I hate being scared to do something.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1491792,1499013,And I think what developed in my early days  was the attitude that
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1499037,1506560,I started attacking things  that I was scared of.  Why were you scared in your bed the night before?
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1506885,1515402,"Why did you, what do you need that fear for?  Just don't go.  Why are you scared in your bed 16 hours before you jump?"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1515426,1523052,"Why are you scared in the car?  Why could you not enjoy breakfast?  Fear is, fear of what?"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1523076,1528742,You're nowhere even near the airplane.  Everything up to the stepping out
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1528766,1534209,there's actually no reason to be scared.  It only just ruins your day
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1534233,1540351,"you're, you don't have to jump  and then in that moment, all of a sudden where you should be terrified"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1540375,1549938,is the most blissful experience of your life  And God placed the best things in life on the other side of terror.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1555179,1560599,And they had the nerve to count you out.  That's because they didn't understand that your motivation
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1560623,1568336,would never let you stay down for the count.  It's times like these that we separate the real from the fake.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1568670,1575010,And winners like you can take a punch and bounce right back  because you understand and know exactly what's at stake.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1575034,1581977,"It's times like these that we separate the real from the fake.  And winners like you can take a punch, bounce right back"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1582001,1587834,"because you understand and know exactly what's at stake.  It's money time, baby"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1588167,1594445,And this is for all of the marbles.  It's put up or shut up.  Survive in advance. Win or go home.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1594501,1599738,And that's why you spend all those hours grinding.  That's why you spend all those hours pushing yourself to the limit.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1599763,1605134,You spend all those hours running.  That's why you spend all those hours sacrificing.  You spend all those hours sweating
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1605158,1611363,"because you know there will be no time for regretting, fretting  or letting yourself or your teammates down."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1611712,1617123,See you are bound and determined  to enter into the realm of greatness that's reserved for you
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1617149,1622290,and only you.  And so if the day ever comes that you're tired enough to quit.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1622352,1628908,"Then I need you to act like a car with 4 flats and re-tire.  I don't think you heard me, I said ""If the day ever comes"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1628932,1635154,"that you are tired enough to quit  then I need you to act like a car with 4 flats and re-tire."""
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1636900,1642627,"Next level success is reserved  for those that are willing to not start counting the reps, until it starts hurting."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1642653,1650055,"Not start counting the shots made, until their arms are dead tired.  Not start counting the sprints, until they're already breathing hard."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1650080,1657523,"I heard a wise man say ""It hurts but it works""  I say when it hurts then and only then will you start receiving the perks."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1657547,1665292,"The accolades, the ATTA-BOYS, the ATTA-GIRLS  the great jobs, the ALLEY OOP LOBS  the celebration parties with the lobster and shish kabobs."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1665316,1672848,"The hoisting of the banners, the sizing for the rings.  The smiles, the hugs and all of the love and respect in-between."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1673085,1680275,"See some of you out there, you in the dark.  And you know what I need you to do for me when you in the dark, right?"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1680300,1686225,Turn the lights on when I'm talking to you because I don't think you heard me.  I said next level success is reserved
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1686250,1694376,"for those that are willing to not start counting the reps until, it starts hurting.  Not start counting the shots made, until their arms are dead tired."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1694400,1698749,"Not start counting the sprints, until they're already breathing hard."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1699455,1706930,So just when they think you're about to throw in the towel  That's when I need you to recall all of the days that you went that extra mile.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1707041,1713072,All of them days that your friends said you were foul  when you said you couldn't hang out because you were dialed in
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1713191,1719435,"You were locked in, you were in a zone  So you had to be strong, because you knew that day would come."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1719460,1726595,"When you would have to show the world that you can overcome any adversity  any obstacles, any hardships, any setback."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1726619,1732889,Because you were prepared for any and everything.  You understood that it would be impossible
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1732913,1738863,To run with them cheetahs when you're walking with the turtles.  You understood that it would be impossible
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1738888,1745459,for you to run with the cheetahs when you were walking with the turtles.  So your mindset is that of a track star
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1745483,1751801,and that gives you the middle strip to leap over life's hurdles  to power through the speed bumps to push through the roadblocks
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1751825,1760372,and continue to grind past any and every obstruction  that attempts to deter you from your ultimate goal of next level success.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1761126,1768577,"So the stresses of the world, you laughing  The dreams they say out of your reach, you grab it."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1768601,1775266,"The things they say you can't achieve, you take a stabbing  And when the bullies of life try to knock you out"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1775290,1781011,"you stick and move and you jab them.  I said the stresses of the world, you laugh at them"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1781035,1787495,"The dreams they say out of your reach, you go and grab at them.  The things they say you can't achieve, you take a stab at them."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1787519,1793082,And when the bullies of life try to knock you out  you stick and move and you jab them.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1793184,1798858,"And on the rare occasion, that you take the punch from life  and it knocks you down."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1798882,1806158,You dig deep and then you dig deep and then you dig even deeper  because you understand that
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1806183,1812792,this is the moment to pick yourself up  Push through with determination and grit.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1812817,1818792,"Because of all your resilience  commitment, hard work, perseverance"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1818816,1824260,you have now put yourself in position to show the world  that you got that dog.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1824403,1831807,And your inner dog Has No Quit.  I said this is the moment to pick yourself up
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1831831,1839972,"and push through with determination and grit.  Because of all your resiliency  commitment, hard work, perseverance"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1839997,1845782,you have put yourself in a position to show the world  that you got that dog.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1845988,1851019,And your inner dog  Has No Quit
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1854256,1860422,I hated jumping out of airplanes  I hated shooting guns  I hated the job as a Navy SEAL
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1860699,1865523,but I did it because I wanted to change myself.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1866270,1874277,"Everything I do I'm not really comfortable doing  but if you choose to go that route, to go be a Navy SEAL"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1875205,1880632,you might as well go be the hardest person in the world  because if you're choosing to do something you have two routes
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1880656,1886719,"you can go there and be a little, a little weak person  and get through, barely and that's your reputation"
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1887132,1891955,or you can go through the hardest guy you can possibly be and that's your reputation.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1892203,1898964,So my whole thing is if you're gonna choose to open that door in Iraq or Afghanistan  open it up and go in hard.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1899320,1904820,Because they're gonna remember you  by slowly opening it and peeking in.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1905129,1912637,"So if you're gonna open it and you made up your mind to open it  don't just crack it open  open the door and go in, that's with life."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1912661,1920049,"If you choose to do, if you're choosing to do something, attack it.  Because they're gonna remember you as not attacking it."
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1920074,1925351,So I want to be remembered  you can hate me but one thing you can't say about me
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1925377,1932155,I didn't attack it.  So that's the mentality to have.  If you're gonna do something you might as well attack it  - Because you're doing it anyway. - Right.
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1932179,1936925,Who on this earth  would still be going right now?
sEmZIi_0Kj8,1937361,1941226,You are  You are
