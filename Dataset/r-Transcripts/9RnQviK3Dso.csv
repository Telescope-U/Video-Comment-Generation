9RnQviK3Dso,9679,11519,this might be the coolest water gun i've
9RnQviK3Dso,11519,14130,ever played with let me tell you why
9RnQviK3Dso,14130,19680,[Music]
9RnQviK3Dso,19680,21680,today we're checking out the spyro 2
9RnQviK3Dso,21680,23840,water gun this thing is awesome it
9RnQviK3Dso,23840,26000,automatically refills itself and there's
9RnQviK3Dso,26000,28800,no pumping required now the spyro 1 was
9RnQviK3Dso,28800,30960,launched as a kickstarter back in 2018
9RnQviK3Dso,30960,32640,but the second generation is now fully
9RnQviK3Dso,32640,34160,available for sale on the company's
9RnQviK3Dso,34160,36000,website it comes in two different colors
9RnQviK3Dso,36000,38320,you have this blue one right here or red
9RnQviK3Dso,38320,40879,and you can get a single for 174 or a
9RnQviK3Dso,40879,43200,dual pack for 329 which comes with one
9RnQviK3Dso,43200,44399,color of each
9RnQviK3Dso,44399,46000,it kind of looks like a halo weapon
9RnQviK3Dso,46000,47680,right almost like master chief's assault
9RnQviK3Dso,47680,49520,rifle and i think that's because of this
9RnQviK3Dso,49520,51600,tactical display right here out of the
9RnQviK3Dso,51600,53280,box this thing takes four to five hours
9RnQviK3Dso,53280,54960,to fully charge the first time which we
9RnQviK3Dso,54960,56399,did yesterday and now we're ready to
9RnQviK3Dso,56399,59039,have some fun all right so to power it
9RnQviK3Dso,59039,60239,on you just push the button on the
9RnQviK3Dso,60239,62399,underside of the handle here as you can
9RnQviK3Dso,62399,65119,see the tactical display is now lit up
9RnQviK3Dso,65119,67360,and to fill the chamber you just dip the
9RnQviK3Dso,67360,69200,nose in a source of water and push the
9RnQviK3Dso,69200,70479,trigger forward
9RnQviK3Dso,70479,72240,and as you can hear it's starting to
9RnQviK3Dso,72240,74080,pull water into the chamber
9RnQviK3Dso,74080,75680,you can actually stop it at any time in
9RnQviK3Dso,75680,77360,case there's a sneak attack
9RnQviK3Dso,77360,78799,and then just put it right back in to
9RnQviK3Dso,78799,81759,start filling it up again
9RnQviK3Dso,82000,84159,it takes about 12 seconds to fully fill
9RnQviK3Dso,84159,87600,on an empty tank
9RnQviK3Dso,87600,89759,the second generation design helps keep
9RnQviK3Dso,89759,90960,the water in the chamber a little bit
9RnQviK3Dso,90960,92640,better as you can see it doesn't leak
9RnQviK3Dso,92640,94000,very much there's a couple drips here
9RnQviK3Dso,94000,95600,and there when you really force it but
9RnQviK3Dso,95600,97520,most of the water is staying inside the
9RnQviK3Dso,97520,99759,chamber spyro 2 has two different types
9RnQviK3Dso,99759,101439,of firing modes with a single pull of
9RnQviK3Dso,101439,104720,the trigger you get your single shot
9RnQviK3Dso,106799,108960,that travels for about nine meters and
9RnQviK3Dso,108960,110240,if you pull the trigger and hold it for
9RnQviK3Dso,110240,112159,three seconds it'll charge your power
9RnQviK3Dso,112159,114000,shot which fires for 14 meters and
9RnQviK3Dso,114000,115439,expels about three times the amount of
9RnQviK3Dso,115439,117759,water
9RnQviK3Dso,118799,122159,gotta love that beefy sound
9RnQviK3Dso,122240,123439,also has a little bit of a kick when you
9RnQviK3Dso,123439,124880,fire it too
9RnQviK3Dso,124880,126560,each single shot takes about five points
9RnQviK3Dso,126560,128479,off of your ammo display and each power
9RnQviK3Dso,128479,130720,shot takes about 15.
9RnQviK3Dso,130720,132560,spyro says that a fully charged battery
9RnQviK3Dso,132560,134640,will get you about 90 tanks of water or
9RnQviK3Dso,134640,136640,2 000 water blasts which should be more
9RnQviK3Dso,136640,138480,than enough for a full day of battling
9RnQviK3Dso,138480,139920,there's three bars on display here and
9RnQviK3Dso,139920,141840,that indicates your firing rate you get
9RnQviK3Dso,141840,143520,three shots back to back but after that
9RnQviK3Dso,143520,144800,you have to let it charge a little in
9RnQviK3Dso,144800,147200,between
9RnQviK3Dso,149040,150239,when you're all done battling for the
9RnQviK3Dso,150239,151760,day you need to get all the water out of
9RnQviK3Dso,151760,153360,the tank before you can safely store the
9RnQviK3Dso,153360,155599,spyro ii to do that you fire off your
9RnQviK3Dso,155599,157760,remaining shots hold the water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,157760,159440,upside down and pull the trigger for
9RnQviK3Dso,159440,161200,about six seconds that's going to kick
9RnQviK3Dso,161200,163040,on the motor and expel any remaining
9RnQviK3Dso,163040,165360,water and when it's all done you should
9RnQviK3Dso,165360,167599,have two bars on the indicator to let
9RnQviK3Dso,167599,169760,you know that the tank is empty
9RnQviK3Dso,169760,171440,now let's test the accuracy of the spire
9RnQviK3Dso,171440,172959,two which seemed pretty good based on
9RnQviK3Dso,172959,174800,some of those early fires but let's give
9RnQviK3Dso,174800,176560,it the old cup on the wall test i'm
9RnQviK3Dso,176560,178480,standing about 17 feet from the wall
9RnQviK3Dso,178480,180000,which isn't too far but i want to make
9RnQviK3Dso,180000,181280,sure there's enough pressure to knock
9RnQviK3Dso,181280,184080,over those cups so let's give it a try
9RnQviK3Dso,184080,192480,[Music]
9RnQviK3Dso,192480,194879,all right pretty accurate right
9RnQviK3Dso,194879,196159,okay
9RnQviK3Dso,196159,197280,now of course we have to test the
9RnQviK3Dso,197280,198959,accuracy of the power shot so what i've
9RnQviK3Dso,198959,200400,done is i've stacked these five cups
9RnQviK3Dso,200400,202080,here on the wall let's see if the power
9RnQviK3Dso,202080,205440,shot can take them all down in one go
9RnQviK3Dso,205440,208239,here we go charging
9RnQviK3Dso,208319,211040,and firing
9RnQviK3Dso,211760,213519,almost all of them we missed one cup but
9RnQviK3Dso,213519,217720,i'm going to blame that on user error
9RnQviK3Dso,219870,225168,[Music]
9RnQviK3Dso,226000,227440,there's only one test left to do and
9RnQviK3Dso,227440,229280,that is to take a shot myself you should
9RnQviK3Dso,229280,230799,never fire a toy weapon on anybody
9RnQviK3Dso,230799,232720,without knowing how it feels first so my
9RnQviK3Dso,232720,234319,camera operator jesse has volunteered to
9RnQviK3Dso,234319,238239,do the arms for me jesse hit me
9RnQviK3Dso,238239,241360,all right power shot
9RnQviK3Dso,241360,242400,oh
9RnQviK3Dso,242400,244080,definitely a little bit of impact but
9RnQviK3Dso,244080,246319,you know it's a nice hot summer day so
9RnQviK3Dso,246319,248560,i'm ready to take more
9RnQviK3Dso,248560,249760,all right and that's all i can think to
9RnQviK3Dso,249760,251760,tell you about the spire two water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,251760,252959,if i helped you make a decision of
9RnQviK3Dso,252959,254239,whether or not you're going to buy one
9RnQviK3Dso,254239,255439,make sure you give this video a nice
9RnQviK3Dso,255439,256479,thumbs up and let me know in the
9RnQviK3Dso,256479,257759,comments whether you're going red or
9RnQviK3Dso,257759,259919,blue if you haven't already subscribe to
9RnQviK3Dso,259919,261840,cnet's youtube channel we've got great
9RnQviK3Dso,261840,263440,tech videos just about every day of the
9RnQviK3Dso,263440,264960,week all right we'll see you in the next
9RnQviK3Dso,264960,267960,one
