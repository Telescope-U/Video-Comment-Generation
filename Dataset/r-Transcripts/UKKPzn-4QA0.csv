UKKPzn-4QA0,320,5520,you have to practice who you want to be  you know you don't wake up one morning
UKKPzn-4QA0,5520,11920,and you're suddenly who you think you  want to be you have to put some energy  into it so if you want to be an honest
UKKPzn-4QA0,11920,18080,person you have to be an honest person  every day  even starting at three and four and five
UKKPzn-4QA0,18080,24960,right if you're going to be a hard  worker hard work doesn't just appear you  have to practice hard work you have to
UKKPzn-4QA0,24960,30640,practice effort and i also encourage  them try to help them understand that
UKKPzn-4QA0,30640,35920,good things don't come easy  you know with that effort you know
UKKPzn-4QA0,35920,41440,that's where you grow that's where  growth some of the best times in my life  when i've grown it's when i've done
UKKPzn-4QA0,41440,47120,something hard  when i've overcome a fear  you don't realize that when you're doing
UKKPzn-4QA0,47120,54480,it but when you come out  on the other side you realize wow i've  really  stepped up so i push my girls but more
UKKPzn-4QA0,54480,59680,importantly i love them a lot and that's  what i feel for all of you
UKKPzn-4QA0,59680,64799,i want you guys to  feel that in your lives so that you can
UKKPzn-4QA0,64799,70880,be excellent  because other people told me that i  might not be able to
UKKPzn-4QA0,70880,76080,to do well in school  for whatever reason i was always a good  student i worked hard but i thought
UKKPzn-4QA0,76080,82960,there was some magic  that happened  that made you really you know i didn't
UKKPzn-4QA0,82960,90960,know that it was just plain old hard  work  so there were periods of doubt for sure  i think we all i have doubts today
UKKPzn-4QA0,90960,97439,doubts don't go away  you just learn how to  deal with them you you start knowing
UKKPzn-4QA0,97439,104320,yourself and you become more confident  the more successes you have the more  chances you take
UKKPzn-4QA0,104320,111840,you don't let the the failures or the  stumbles define you  you know everybody falls every now and
UKKPzn-4QA0,111840,119040,then some people fall a lot  and what i realized is that we have long  lives if we're healthy and we do what
UKKPzn-4QA0,119040,125840,we're supposed to do  i'm 47 years old  so think about it whatever mistake i
UKKPzn-4QA0,125840,133440,made when i was 13 who cares  so think about life as a long trajectory
UKKPzn-4QA0,133440,140400,but at the same time  you don't want to make huge mistakes  because when you're young
UKKPzn-4QA0,140400,147840,making big big mistakes can last forever  right so you want to choose wisely
UKKPzn-4QA0,147840,153599,but the stumbles the lessons learned  that's part of life that that makes you
UKKPzn-4QA0,153599,160080,grow but i i came to know that i didn't  know that when i was your age i thought  every every mistake was the end of the
UKKPzn-4QA0,160080,166640,world  i'll never be able i'll never get into  school i'll never be you know of course  we all feel that way
UKKPzn-4QA0,166640,172319,um but just continue to work put the put  the effort in and i think
UKKPzn-4QA0,172319,178879,that has been  some of what's helped me being first  lady  first of all is knowing who you are and
UKKPzn-4QA0,178879,186000,being confident in yourself because  there'll be  clarissa what do you say pushing beyond  other people's labels of you
UKKPzn-4QA0,186000,192080,right that's a big part that's what we  do to each other all the time we don't  even know each other and we already
UKKPzn-4QA0,192080,197599,determined from one glance meeting one  line one word one phrase this is who you
UKKPzn-4QA0,197599,203760,are  so you have to know who you are  before that
UKKPzn-4QA0,203760,210000,and you and you live that reality and  you keep living it out no matter what
UKKPzn-4QA0,210000,215200,and if you're a good have good character  and and good intentions
UKKPzn-4QA0,215200,220319,that that ultimately shines through but  in the end it's hard work
UKKPzn-4QA0,220319,227519,and  i like to work hard and i like to do  good things  and you practice that now
UKKPzn-4QA0,227519,233200,and believe it or not i didn't know it  it prepared me to be the first lady of  united states i didn't know i guess i'm
UKKPzn-4QA0,233200,239519,doing okay but you know what  every day we just get up  and keep doing what we think is the
UKKPzn-4QA0,239519,244560,right thing  read  write
UKKPzn-4QA0,244560,249840,read read if the president were here  one of his greatest
UKKPzn-4QA0,249840,256000,strengths is reading  that's one of the reasons why he's a  good communicator why he's such a good
UKKPzn-4QA0,256000,262479,writer he's a voracious reader so we're  trying to get our girls no matter what  to just be
UKKPzn-4QA0,262479,269120,to love reading and to challenge  themselves with what they read not just  read the gossip books but push
UKKPzn-4QA0,269120,275040,themselves beyond and do things that  maybe they wouldn't do so i would  encourage you all to
UKKPzn-4QA0,275040,281199,to read read read just keep reading and  writing is another skill it's practice
UKKPzn-4QA0,281199,287680,it's practice the more you write the  better you get drafts  our kids are learning the first draft
UKKPzn-4QA0,287680,293680,means nothing you're gonna do seven ten  drafts that's writing it's not failure  it's not
UKKPzn-4QA0,293680,299199,not the teacher not liking you because  it's all marked up and read  when you get to be a good writer you
UKKPzn-4QA0,299199,305759,mark your own stuff in red  and you rewrite and you rewrite and you  rewrite that's what writing is
UKKPzn-4QA0,305759,311360,and if you come out with those skills  and then you're confident and you can
UKKPzn-4QA0,311360,318880,articulate and you can stand up straight  and look anybody in the eye and say this  is who i am it's a pleasure to meet you
UKKPzn-4QA0,318880,324880,that's one of the things we try to do  with our mentoring program with young  girls  my message to them is if you can walk
UKKPzn-4QA0,324880,331360,into the white house  and meet the first lady and say my name  is how are you and look me in the eye
UKKPzn-4QA0,331360,336400,then there's nothing you can't do that's  why it's important if you guys walked  here
UKKPzn-4QA0,336400,342160,are sitting here in front of all these  people  standing tall asking questions using
UKKPzn-4QA0,342160,347520,your voice  you have to practice that  these arenas just show up again and
UKKPzn-4QA0,347520,355280,again and then you just get used to it  the nerves go away and you start  relaxing into your own abilities
UKKPzn-4QA0,355280,361680,but it's practice  when you are struggling
UKKPzn-4QA0,361680,367120,and you start thinking about giving up  i want you to remember something that my
UKKPzn-4QA0,367120,373759,husband and i have talked about since we  first started this journey nearly a  decade ago
UKKPzn-4QA0,373759,379199,something that has carried us through  every moment  in this white house in every moment of
UKKPzn-4QA0,379199,384880,our lives  and that is the power of hope
UKKPzn-4QA0,384880,394160,the belief that something better  is always possible if you're willing to  work for it and fight for it
UKKPzn-4QA0,394160,401280,it is our fundamental belief in the  power of hope that has allowed us to  rise above the voices of doubt and
UKKPzn-4QA0,401280,406479,division  of anger and fear that we have faced in
UKKPzn-4QA0,406479,412400,our own lives and in the life of this  country  our hope that if we work hard enough and
UKKPzn-4QA0,412400,418960,believe in ourselves  then we can be whatever we dream  regardless of the limitations that
UKKPzn-4QA0,418960,424800,others may place on us  the hope that when people see us for who
UKKPzn-4QA0,424800,432080,we truly are  maybe just maybe  they too will be inspired
UKKPzn-4QA0,432080,438960,to rise to their best possible selves  shoot it's the hope of my  folks like my dad
UKKPzn-4QA0,438960,446080,got up every day  do his job at the city water plant  the hope that one day his kids
UKKPzn-4QA0,446080,451680,would go to college  and have opportunities he never dreamed  of
UKKPzn-4QA0,451680,458160,that's the kind of hope  that every single one of us  politicians
UKKPzn-4QA0,458160,463360,parents preachers all of us  need to be providing for our young  people
UKKPzn-4QA0,463360,469199,because that is what moves this country  forward every single day  our hope for the future
UKKPzn-4QA0,469199,476000,and the hard work that hope inspires i  want our young people to know  that they matter
UKKPzn-4QA0,476000,481280,that they  belong  so don't be afraid  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,481280,487680,you hear me young people don't be afraid  be focused  be determined
UKKPzn-4QA0,487680,494160,be hopeful  be empowered  empower yourselves with a good education
UKKPzn-4QA0,494160,500319,then get out there and use that  education to build a country worthy of  your boundless promise
UKKPzn-4QA0,500319,506520,lead by example with hope  never fear
UKKPzn-4QA0,507720,512959,[Music]  so i figured something out that i  thought i'd tell you about this took me
UKKPzn-4QA0,512959,519440,like 30 years to figure out and i  figured it out on this tour  so there's this old idea you know that  you have to rescue your father from the
UKKPzn-4QA0,519440,525920,belly of the whale right from some  monster that's deep in the abyss you see  that pinocchio for example but it's a
UKKPzn-4QA0,525920,531279,very common idea and i figured out why  that is i think  so
UKKPzn-4QA0,531279,537279,imagine that we already know from a  clinical perspective that  you know if you set out a path towards a
UKKPzn-4QA0,537279,543440,goal which you want to do because you  need a goal and you need a path because  that provides you with positive emotion
UKKPzn-4QA0,543440,550000,right so you set up something as  valuable so that implies a hierarchy you  set up something as valuable you decide
UKKPzn-4QA0,550000,556800,that you're going to do that instead of  other things so that's kind of a  sacrifice because you're sacrificing  everything else to pursue that and then
UKKPzn-4QA0,556800,562000,you experience a fair bit of positive  emotion and meaning as you watch  yourself move towards the goal and so
UKKPzn-4QA0,562000,567920,the implication of that is the the  better the goal the the more full and  rich your experience is going to be when
UKKPzn-4QA0,567920,574000,you pursue it so that's one of the  reasons of  that's one of the reasons for developing  a vision and for fleshing yourself out
UKKPzn-4QA0,574000,580480,philosophically because you want to aim  at the highest goal that you can manage  okay so you do that
UKKPzn-4QA0,580480,585519,and then what you'll find is that as you  move towards the goal there are certain  things that that that you have to
UKKPzn-4QA0,585519,591360,accomplish that frighten you you know  maybe you have to learn to be a better  speaker a better writer a better thinker
UKKPzn-4QA0,591360,597600,you have to be better to people around  you or you have to learn some new skills  and you're afraid of that whatever  because it's going to stretch you if you
UKKPzn-4QA0,597600,603279,if you pursue a goal and it's and so  that'll put you up against challenges  okay so all the clinical
UKKPzn-4QA0,603279,609680,data indicates well the opposite of safe  spaces as jonathan height has been  pointing out that what you want to do
UKKPzn-4QA0,609680,615120,when  you identify something that someone is  avoiding that they need to do because
UKKPzn-4QA0,615120,621279,they're afraid you have them voluntary  con voluntarily confronted and so you  break it down what you try to do if
UKKPzn-4QA0,621279,626640,you're a behavior therapist is you break  down the thing they're avoiding into  smaller and smaller pieces until you
UKKPzn-4QA0,626640,631680,find a piece that's small enough so  they'll do it and it doesn't really  matter as long as they start it you know
UKKPzn-4QA0,631680,637600,then they can put the next piece on the  next piece and what happens is  they don't get less afraid exactly they
UKKPzn-4QA0,637600,643519,get braver  they get they get it's like there's more  of them you can and here's why so  imagine
UKKPzn-4QA0,643519,650160,you do something new  and that's informative right there's  information in the action and then you
UKKPzn-4QA0,650160,655920,can incorporate that information and  turn it into a skill and turn it into a  transformation of your perceptions so
UKKPzn-4QA0,655920,661760,there's more to you because you've tried  something new so that's one thing the  second thing is
UKKPzn-4QA0,661760,667519,and there's good biological evidence for  this now that  if you put yourself in a new situation
UKKPzn-4QA0,667519,672880,then new genes code for new proteins and  build new neural structures a new
UKKPzn-4QA0,672880,677920,nervous system structures same thing  happens to some degree when you work out  right because your your muscles are
UKKPzn-4QA0,677920,684959,responding to the load but your nervous  system does that too so you imagine that  there's a lot of potential you locked in
UKKPzn-4QA0,684959,691279,your genetic code  and then if you put yourself in a new  situation then then the stress that's
UKKPzn-4QA0,691279,696959,the situational stress that's produced  by that particular situation unlocks  those genes and then builds new parts of
UKKPzn-4QA0,696959,704399,you so that's very cool because who  knows how much there is locked inside of  you okay so now here's the idea
UKKPzn-4QA0,704399,710880,so  let's assume that that scales as you  take on heavier and heavier loads
UKKPzn-4QA0,710880,718639,that more and more of you you get more  and more informed because you're doing  more and more difficult things but more  and more of you gets unlocked
UKKPzn-4QA0,718639,724959,and so then  what that would imply is that  if you got to the point where you could  look at the darkest things so that would
UKKPzn-4QA0,724959,730959,be the abyss right that would be the  deepest abyss if you could look at the  harshest things like the most brutal
UKKPzn-4QA0,730959,736320,parts of the suffering of the world and  the malevolence of people and society if  you could look that
UKKPzn-4QA0,736320,742959,look at that  straight and and directly that that  would turn you on maximally
UKKPzn-4QA0,742959,750800,and so that's the idea of rescuing your  father because imagine that you're like  the potential composite of of all your
UKKPzn-4QA0,750800,755920,all the ancestral wisdom that's locked  inside of you biologically but that's
UKKPzn-4QA0,755920,762000,not going to come out at all unless you  stress yourself unless you unless you  challenge yourself and the bigger the
UKKPzn-4QA0,762000,768079,challenge you take on the more that's  going to turn on and so that as you take  on a broader and broader range of
UKKPzn-4QA0,768079,774959,challenges and you push yourself harder  then more and more of what you could be  turns on and that's equivalent to
UKKPzn-4QA0,774959,781279,transforming yourself into the ancestral  father into all because you're you're  like the what would you call it you're
UKKPzn-4QA0,781279,787360,the consequence of all these  living beings that have come before you  and that's all
UKKPzn-4QA0,787360,794639,part of your biological potentiality and  then if you can push yourself then all  that clicks on and that turns you into
UKKPzn-4QA0,794639,800880,who you could be that's and that's the  re-representation of that  positive ancestral father the point is
UKKPzn-4QA0,800880,806240,your best strategic position  is  how am i insufficient and how can i
UKKPzn-4QA0,806240,811600,rectify that  that's what you've got and the thing is  you are insufficient
UKKPzn-4QA0,811600,817200,and you could rectify it  both of those are within your grasp if  you aim low enough one of the things why
UKKPzn-4QA0,817200,823680,do you see that that's another thing you  keep saying aim low enough have a low  enough bar why do you why do you mean  that well let's say you've got a kid and
UKKPzn-4QA0,823680,829040,you want the kid to improve you don't  set them a bar that's so high that it's  impossible for them to attain it you
UKKPzn-4QA0,829040,834320,take a look at the kid and you think  okay this kid's got this range of skill  here's a challenge we can throw at him
UKKPzn-4QA0,834320,840880,or her that exceeds their current level  of skill but gives them a reasonable  probability of success
UKKPzn-4QA0,840880,847839,and so like i'm saying it  tongue-in-cheek to some degree you know  it's like but if you're but i'm doing it  as an aide to humility it's like well i
UKKPzn-4QA0,847839,854560,don't know how to start improving my  life someone might say that and i would  say well you're not aiming low enough
UKKPzn-4QA0,854560,860800,there's something you could do that you  are regarding as trivial  that that you could do that you would do
UKKPzn-4QA0,860800,866320,that would result in an actual  improvement but it's not a big enough  improvement for you so you won't lower
UKKPzn-4QA0,866320,872720,yourself enough to take the opportunity  incremental steps yes and so this is  also what is achieved through exercise
UKKPzn-4QA0,872720,878399,it's one of the most important  well what do you do when you go and lift  weights you don't go in like if you  haven't bench pressed before you don't
UKKPzn-4QA0,878399,884560,put 400 pounds on the damn bar and drop  the and drop the bar through your skull  right you know you think look when i
UKKPzn-4QA0,884560,890639,started working out when i was a kid i  was i was weighed about 130 pounds and i  was six foot one was a thin kid and i
UKKPzn-4QA0,890639,895839,smoked a lot i wasn't in good shape i  wasn't in good physical shape and i went  to the gym and it was bloody
UKKPzn-4QA0,895839,902320,embarrassing you know people would come  over and help me with the goddamn  weights here's how you're supposed to  use this you know it's humiliating and
UKKPzn-4QA0,902320,908079,maybe i was pressing 65 pounds or  something at that point you know but  what am i going to do i'm going to lift
UKKPzn-4QA0,908079,914639,up 150 pounds and injure myself right  off the bat no i had to go in there and  strip down and put my skinny goddamn
UKKPzn-4QA0,914639,921199,self in front of the mirror and think  son of a there's all these  monsters in the gym who've been lifting  weights for 10 years and i'm struggling
UKKPzn-4QA0,921199,926320,to get 50 pounds off the bar tough luck  for me but i could lift 50 pounds and it
UKKPzn-4QA0,926320,932880,wasn't fair very long until i could lift  75 and well you know how it goes but and  i never injured myself when i was
UKKPzn-4QA0,932880,939519,weightlifting and the reason for that  was i never pushed myself past where i  knew i could go and i pushed myself a
UKKPzn-4QA0,939519,944959,lot you know i gained 35 pounds of  muscle in about three years in  university i kind of had to quit because
UKKPzn-4QA0,944959,950880,i was eating so goddamn much i couldn't  stand it it's eating like six meals a  day it was just taking up too much time
UKKPzn-4QA0,950880,957360,but there's a humility in determining  what it is that the wretched creature  that you are can actually manage aim low
UKKPzn-4QA0,957360,964800,and i don't mean don't aim and i don't  mean don't aim up  but you have to accept the fact that
UKKPzn-4QA0,964800,969920,you can set yourself a goal that you can  attain and there's not going to be much  glory in it to begin with
UKKPzn-4QA0,969920,976000,because if you're not in very good shape  the goal that you could could attain  tomorrow isn't very glorious
UKKPzn-4QA0,976000,982320,but it's a hell of a lot better than  nothing and it beats the hell out of  bitterness and it's way better than  blaming someone else it's way less
UKKPzn-4QA0,982320,989440,dangerous and you could do it and what's  cool about it  there's a statement in the new testament
UKKPzn-4QA0,989440,994560,it's called the matthew principle and  economists use it to describe how the  economy and the world works to those who
UKKPzn-4QA0,994560,1000800,have everything more will be given from  those who have nothing everything will  be taken it's like what's very  pessimistic in some sense because it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1000800,1007440,means that as you start to fail you fail  more and more rapidly but it also means  that as you start to succeed you succeed
UKKPzn-4QA0,1007440,1015759,more and more rapidly and so you take an  incremental step and well now you can  lift 55 pounds instead of 52.5 pounds
UKKPzn-4QA0,1015759,1022880,you think what the hell's that it's like  it's one step on a very long journey  and so it's it and it starts to compound
UKKPzn-4QA0,1022880,1028798,on you so a small step today means puts  you in a position to take a slightly  bigger step the next day and then that
UKKPzn-4QA0,1028798,1037020,puts you in a position to take a  slightly bigger step the next day you do  that for two or three years man you're  starting to stride
UKKPzn-4QA0,1037020,1040660,[Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,1043280,1050160,i found that nothing in life  is worthwhile  unless you take risks
UKKPzn-4QA0,1050160,1055919,nothing  nelson mandela said there is no passion  to be found
UKKPzn-4QA0,1055919,1062880,playing small  in settling for a life that's less  than the one you're capable of living
UKKPzn-4QA0,1062880,1068400,now i'm sure in your experiences in  school and applying to college and  picking your major and deciding what you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1068400,1074240,want to do with life i'm sure people  have told you to make sure you have  something to fall back on make sure you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1074240,1079600,got something to fall back on honey  but i never understood that concept
UKKPzn-4QA0,1079600,1085120,having something to fall back on  if i'm going to fall
UKKPzn-4QA0,1085120,1090400,i don't want to fall back on anything  except my faith
UKKPzn-4QA0,1090400,1097279,i want to fall forward  i figure at least this way i'll see what  i'm going to hit
UKKPzn-4QA0,1098080,1105360,fall forward  this is what i mean  reggie jackson struck out 2600 times in
UKKPzn-4QA0,1105360,1110640,his career the most  in the history of baseball but you don't  hear about the strikeouts people
UKKPzn-4QA0,1110640,1116480,remember the home runs  fall forward
UKKPzn-4QA0,1116480,1123679,thomas edison conducted 1 000 failed  experiments did you know that i didn't  know that because the one thousand and
UKKPzn-4QA0,1123679,1130080,first was the light bulb  fall forward
UKKPzn-4QA0,1130080,1136960,every failed experiment is one step  closer to success you've got to take  risks and i'm sure you've probably heard
UKKPzn-4QA0,1136960,1143760,that before but i want to talk to you  about why that's so important  first
UKKPzn-4QA0,1143760,1151280,you will fail at some point in your life  accept it you will lose you will  embarrass yourself you will suck at
UKKPzn-4QA0,1151280,1157280,something there's no doubt about it  and i know that's probably not a  traditional message for a graduation
UKKPzn-4QA0,1157280,1162799,ceremony but hey  i'm telling you embrace it because it's  inevitable
UKKPzn-4QA0,1162799,1169120,and i should know  in the acting business you fail all the  time early on in my career
UKKPzn-4QA0,1169120,1174880,i auditioned for a part in a broadway  musical  perfect role for me i thought
UKKPzn-4QA0,1174880,1181679,except for the fact that i can't sing  so  i'm i'm in the wings i'm about to go on
UKKPzn-4QA0,1181679,1190080,stage but the guy in front of me he's  singing like  like like paparazzi he's just wrong
UKKPzn-4QA0,1190640,1196000,and he's just going on and on and on and  i'm just shrinking i'm getting smaller  and smaller
UKKPzn-4QA0,1196000,1201120,so they say oh thank you very much thank  you very much and you will you'll be  hearing from us
UKKPzn-4QA0,1201120,1206240,so i come out with my little sheet music  and  it was it was uh
UKKPzn-4QA0,1206240,1213120,just my imagination by the temptations  that's what i came up with  so i hand it to the the the accompanist
UKKPzn-4QA0,1213120,1219039,and uh she looks at it and looks at me  and looks out at the director and was  like
UKKPzn-4QA0,1219039,1225760,all right  so i i start you know that's i'm i'm  gonna sing i'm like you know and
UKKPzn-4QA0,1225760,1231360,it's just my imagination  once again
UKKPzn-4QA0,1231360,1237520,and then  coming  and i'm not saying anything so i'm  thinking i'm getting better so i can
UKKPzn-4QA0,1237520,1243039,start getting into it  [Music]  [Applause]
UKKPzn-4QA0,1243039,1249120,running this oh yeah  yeah thank you thank you thank you very  much mr washington thank you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1249120,1254240,so i assumed i didn't get the job  but the next part of the audition he
UKKPzn-4QA0,1254240,1260320,called me back the next part of the  audition is the acting part of the  audition so i'm like hey okay maybe i
UKKPzn-4QA0,1260320,1266799,can't sing but i know i can act  so they pair me with this guy and again  i didn't know about musical theater and
UKKPzn-4QA0,1266799,1275039,musical theater is big so they can reach  everyone all the way in the back of the  stadium and i'm more from a realistic
UKKPzn-4QA0,1275039,1280240,naturalistic kind of acting where you  you know you actually talk to the person  next to you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1280240,1287200,so i don't know what my line was my line  was well hand me the cup  and his line was well i will hand you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1287200,1292720,the cup my dear the cup will be there to  be handed to you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1295039,1300720,i said  okay  will
UKKPzn-4QA0,1300720,1306640,should i give you the cup back oh yes  you should give it back to me because  you know that is my cup and it should be
UKKPzn-4QA0,1306640,1314559,giving back  to me  i didn't get the job
UKKPzn-4QA0,1316480,1321840,but here's the thing  i didn't quit
UKKPzn-4QA0,1321919,1328640,i didn't fall back  i walked out of there to prepare for the  next audition and the next audition and
UKKPzn-4QA0,1328640,1335360,the next audition  i prayed  i prayed
UKKPzn-4QA0,1335360,1340559,and i prayed  but i continued to fail
UKKPzn-4QA0,1340559,1346559,and fail  and fail but it didn't matter because  you know what  there's an old saying
UKKPzn-4QA0,1346559,1352080,you hang around the barber shop long  enough sooner or later you're going to  get a haircut
UKKPzn-4QA0,1352720,1359360,so you will catch a break and i did  catch a break  last year
UKKPzn-4QA0,1359360,1365520,i did a play called fences on broadway  [Music]  someone talked about it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1365520,1372080,won the tony award  and i didn't have to sing by the way
UKKPzn-4QA0,1372080,1377360,but here's the kicker  it was at the court theater
UKKPzn-4QA0,1377360,1384080,it was at the same theater that i failed  that first audition  30 years prior
UKKPzn-4QA0,1384080,1390240,the point is every graduate here today  has the training and the talent to  succeed
UKKPzn-4QA0,1390240,1395360,but do you have the guts  to fail  here's my second point about failure if
UKKPzn-4QA0,1395360,1400799,you don't fail  you're not even trying
UKKPzn-4QA0,1400880,1407360,i'll say it again if you don't fail  you're not even trying my wife told me  this great expression to get something
UKKPzn-4QA0,1407360,1414000,you never had you have to do something  you never did  les brown's a motivational speaker he
UKKPzn-4QA0,1414000,1420000,made an analogy about this he says  imagine you're on your death bed and  standing around your deathbed are the
UKKPzn-4QA0,1420000,1425120,ghosts representing your unfulfilled  potential the ghost of the ideas you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1425120,1433200,never acted on the ghost of the talents  you didn't use and they're standing  around your bed angry disappointed and
UKKPzn-4QA0,1433200,1440000,upset  they say we we came to you because you  could have brought us to life they say
UKKPzn-4QA0,1440000,1445840,and now we have to go to the grave  together so i ask you today
UKKPzn-4QA0,1445840,1452240,how many ghosts are going to be around  your bed when your time comes  you've invested you you've invested a
UKKPzn-4QA0,1452240,1458000,lot in your education and people have  invested in you and let me tell you the  world needs your talents man does it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1458000,1464720,ever i just got back from africa like  two days ago so if i'm rambling on it's  cause i'm jet lagged i just got back
UKKPzn-4QA0,1464720,1471600,from south africa it's beautiful country  but there are places there with terrible  poverty that need help and africa is
UKKPzn-4QA0,1471600,1478640,just the tip of the iceberg the middle  east needs your help japan needs your  help alabama needs your help tennessee
UKKPzn-4QA0,1478640,1485240,needs your help louisiana needs your  help philadelphia needs your help
UKKPzn-4QA0,1486320,1491440,the world needs a lot and we need it  from you  we really do we need it from you young
UKKPzn-4QA0,1491440,1496559,people i mean i'm not speaking for the  rest of us up here but i know i'm  getting a little grayer
UKKPzn-4QA0,1496559,1501600,we need it from you the young people  because remember this so you got to get  out there
UKKPzn-4QA0,1501600,1508080,you got to give it everything you got  whether it's your time  your your your talent
UKKPzn-4QA0,1508080,1513520,your prayers  or your treasures because remember this
UKKPzn-4QA0,1513520,1518799,you will never see a u-haul  behind a hearse
UKKPzn-4QA0,1519200,1524559,you can't take it with you  the egyptians tried it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1524559,1528600,and all they got was robbed
UKKPzn-4QA0,1530159,1536159,so the question is  what are you going to do with what you  have i'm not talking about how much you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1536159,1541440,have  some of you are business majors some of  you are theologians nurses sociologists
UKKPzn-4QA0,1541440,1548080,some of you have money some of you have  patience some of you have kindness some  of you have loved some of you have the
UKKPzn-4QA0,1548080,1554480,gift of long-suffering whatever it is  whatever your gift is  what are you going to do
UKKPzn-4QA0,1554480,1560400,with what you have  all right now here's my last point about  failure
UKKPzn-4QA0,1560400,1566720,sometimes  it's the best way  to figure out where you're going
UKKPzn-4QA0,1566720,1572799,your life will never be a straight path  i began at fordham university as a  pre-med student i i
UKKPzn-4QA0,1572799,1578960,i took a course called the  cardiac morphos i still can't say it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1578960,1584159,cardiac  cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it  i couldn't say it i sure couldn't pass
UKKPzn-4QA0,1584159,1590000,it  so then i decided to go into pre-law
UKKPzn-4QA0,1590000,1595510,then journalism and with no academic  focus my grades took off in their own  direction
UKKPzn-4QA0,1595510,1603360,[Music]  yeah down  i was a 1.8 gpa
UKKPzn-4QA0,1603360,1610240,one semester and the university very  politely suggested that it might be  better to take some time off
UKKPzn-4QA0,1610240,1615760,i was 20 years old i was at my lowest  point  and then one day and i remember the
UKKPzn-4QA0,1615760,1621679,exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my  mother in her beauty shop my mother
UKKPzn-4QA0,1621679,1627840,owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon  and there's there was this older woman  who was considered one of the elders in
UKKPzn-4QA0,1627840,1634400,the town and i didn't know her  personally but i was looking in the  mirror and every time i looked in the  mirror i could see her behind me and she
UKKPzn-4QA0,1634400,1640640,was staring at me  she just kept looking at me every time i  looked at her she kept giving me these  strange looks
UKKPzn-4QA0,1640640,1646000,so she finally took the dryer off her  head and said  some she said something i'll never  forget
UKKPzn-4QA0,1646000,1651279,first of all she said somebody give me a  piece of paper give me a piece of paper  she said young boy
UKKPzn-4QA0,1651279,1656480,i have a prophecy  a spiritual prophecy
UKKPzn-4QA0,1656480,1662320,she said you are going to travel the  world  and speak to millions of people now mind
UKKPzn-4QA0,1662320,1667919,you i'm 20 years old i'm flunked out of  school in fact like a wise ass i'm  thinking to myself maybe she's got
UKKPzn-4QA0,1667919,1674080,something in that crystal ball about me  getting back into school next fall  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,1674080,1679200,but maybe she was on to something  because later that summer while working  as a counselor at the ymca camp in
UKKPzn-4QA0,1679200,1685279,connecticut we put on a talent show for  the campers and after the show another  counselor came up to me and asked have
UKKPzn-4QA0,1685279,1691760,you ever thought about acting you're  good at that  so when i got back to fordham that fall  i got in and i changed my major once
UKKPzn-4QA0,1691760,1698640,again  for the last time  and in the years that followed just as  that woman prophesies i have traveled
UKKPzn-4QA0,1698640,1705520,the world and i have spoken to millions  of people through my movies  millions who up until this day
UKKPzn-4QA0,1705520,1711039,couldn't see me i who up till this day i  couldn't see while i was talking to them
UKKPzn-4QA0,1711039,1717440,and they couldn't see me they could only  see the movie  they couldn't see the real me
UKKPzn-4QA0,1717840,1725279,but i see you today  and i'm encouraged by what i see
UKKPzn-4QA0,1725279,1731679,and i'm strengthened  by what i see  [Music]  and i love
UKKPzn-4QA0,1731679,1738410,what i see  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,1738720,1744000,today i want to tell you three stories  from my life  that's it no big deal
UKKPzn-4QA0,1744000,1750480,just three stories  [Music]  the first story
UKKPzn-4QA0,1750480,1755840,is about connecting the dots  [Music]  i dropped out of reed college after the
UKKPzn-4QA0,1755840,1762320,first six months but then stayed around  as a drop in for another 18 months or so  before i really quit
UKKPzn-4QA0,1762320,1768240,so why'd i drop out  it started before i was born
UKKPzn-4QA0,1768240,1775279,my biological mother was a young unwed  graduate student and she decided to put  me up for adoption
UKKPzn-4QA0,1775279,1781200,she felt very strongly that i should be  adopted by college graduates so  everything was all set for me to be
UKKPzn-4QA0,1781200,1786720,adopted at birth by a lawyer and his  wife  except that when i popped out they
UKKPzn-4QA0,1786720,1793120,decided at the last minute that they  really wanted a girl  so my parents who were on a waiting list
UKKPzn-4QA0,1793120,1798799,got a call in the middle of the night  asking  we've got an unexpected baby boy do you
UKKPzn-4QA0,1798799,1803759,want him  they said of course
UKKPzn-4QA0,1803840,1809919,my biological mother found out later  that my mother had never graduated from  college and that my father had never
UKKPzn-4QA0,1809919,1816240,graduated from high school  she refused to sign the final adoption  papers
UKKPzn-4QA0,1816240,1823840,she only relented a few months later  when my parents promised that i would go  to college this was the start
UKKPzn-4QA0,1823840,1830399,in my life  and 17 years later i did go to college
UKKPzn-4QA0,1830399,1837200,but i naively chose a college that was  almost as expensive as stanford  and all of my working class parents
UKKPzn-4QA0,1837200,1842399,savings were being spent on my college  tuition  after six months i couldn't see the
UKKPzn-4QA0,1842399,1847840,value in it  i had no idea what i wanted to do with  my life and no idea how college was
UKKPzn-4QA0,1847840,1855440,going to help me figure it out  and here i was spending all the money my  parents had saved their entire life
UKKPzn-4QA0,1855440,1860480,so i decided to drop out and trust that  it would all work out okay
UKKPzn-4QA0,1860480,1866880,it was pretty scary at the time but  looking back it was one of the best  decisions i ever made
UKKPzn-4QA0,1866880,1872559,the minute i dropped out  i could stop taking the required classes  that didn't interest me
UKKPzn-4QA0,1872559,1877600,and begin dropping in on the ones that  looked far more interesting
UKKPzn-4QA0,1877600,1883440,it wasn't all romantic  i didn't have a dorm room so i slept on  the floor in friends rooms
UKKPzn-4QA0,1883440,1889360,i returned coke bottles for the five  cent deposits to buy food with  and i would walk the seven miles across
UKKPzn-4QA0,1889360,1894960,town every sunday night  to get one good meal a week at the hari  krishna temple
UKKPzn-4QA0,1894960,1900559,i loved it  and much of what i stumbled into by  following my curiosity and intuition
UKKPzn-4QA0,1900559,1906159,turned out to be priceless later on  let me give you one example
UKKPzn-4QA0,1906159,1911200,reed college at that time offered  perhaps the best calligraphy instruction  in the country
UKKPzn-4QA0,1911200,1918159,throughout the campus  every poster every label on every drawer  was beautifully hand calligraphed
UKKPzn-4QA0,1918159,1924399,because i had dropped out and didn't  have to take the normal classes  i decided to take a calligraphy class to
UKKPzn-4QA0,1924399,1930399,learn how to do this  i learned about serif and sans serif  typefaces about varying the amount of
UKKPzn-4QA0,1930399,1936240,space between different letter  combinations about what makes great  typography great
UKKPzn-4QA0,1936240,1941279,it was beautiful historical artistically  subtle in a way that science can't
UKKPzn-4QA0,1941279,1947039,capture  and i found it fascinating  none of this had even a hope of any
UKKPzn-4QA0,1947039,1952240,practical application  in my life  but 10 years later when we were
UKKPzn-4QA0,1952240,1959039,designing the first macintosh computer  it all came back to me  and we designed it all into the mac it
UKKPzn-4QA0,1959039,1964399,was the first computer with beautiful  typography  if i had never dropped in on that single
UKKPzn-4QA0,1964399,1970159,course in college the mac would have  never had multiple typefaces or  proportionally spaced fonts
UKKPzn-4QA0,1970159,1976159,and since windows just copied the mac  it's likely that no personal computer  would have them
UKKPzn-4QA0,1976159,1981840,if i had never dropped out i would have  never dropped in on that calligraphy  class and personal computers might not
UKKPzn-4QA0,1981840,1988320,have the wonderful typography that they  do  of course it was impossible to connect  the dots looking forward when i was in
UKKPzn-4QA0,1988320,1993440,college but it was very very clear  looking backwards ten years later
UKKPzn-4QA0,1993440,1999120,again you can't connect the dots looking  forward you can only connect them  looking backwards
UKKPzn-4QA0,1999120,2006000,so you have to trust that the dots will  somehow connect in your future you have  to trust in something your gut destiny
UKKPzn-4QA0,2006000,2011360,life karma whatever  because believing that the dots will  connect down the road
UKKPzn-4QA0,2011360,2018159,will give you the confidence to follow  your heart  even when it leads you off the well-worn  path and that will make all the
UKKPzn-4QA0,2018159,2024080,difference  [Music]  my second story
UKKPzn-4QA0,2024080,2030640,is about love and loss  i was lucky i found what i loved to do
UKKPzn-4QA0,2030640,2037919,early in life woz and i started apple in  my parents garage when i was 20.  we worked hard and in 10 years apple had
UKKPzn-4QA0,2037919,2043840,grown from just the two of us in a  garage into a two billion dollar company  with over 4 000 employees
UKKPzn-4QA0,2043840,2050000,we just released our finest creation the  macintosh a year earlier and i just  turned 30
UKKPzn-4QA0,2050000,2056158,and then i got fired  how can you get fired from a company you  started  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,2056158,2061200,well  as apple grew we hired someone who i  thought was very talented to run the
UKKPzn-4QA0,2061200,2067200,company with me and for the first year  or so things went well but then our  visions of the future began to diverge
UKKPzn-4QA0,2067200,2074960,and eventually we had a falling out  when we did our board of directors sided  with him and so at 30 i was out
UKKPzn-4QA0,2074960,2080398,and very publicly out  what had been the focus of my entire  adult life was gone and it was
UKKPzn-4QA0,2080398,2086240,devastating  i really didn't know what to do for a  few months  i felt that i'd let the previous
UKKPzn-4QA0,2086240,2091679,generation of entrepreneurs down that i  had dropped the baton as it was being  passed to me
UKKPzn-4QA0,2091679,2098000,i met with david packard and bob noyce  and tried to apologize for screwing up  so badly
UKKPzn-4QA0,2098000,2103839,i was a very public failure and i even  thought about running away from the  valley but something slowly began to
UKKPzn-4QA0,2103839,2110160,dawn on me  i still loved what i did  the turn of events at apple had not
UKKPzn-4QA0,2110160,2115599,changed that one bit  i'd been rejected but i was still in  love
UKKPzn-4QA0,2115599,2121359,and so i decided to start over  i didn't see it then  but it turned out that getting fired
UKKPzn-4QA0,2121359,2126800,from apple was the best thing that could  have ever happened to me  the heaviness of being successful was
UKKPzn-4QA0,2126800,2133040,replaced by the likeness of being a  beginner again less sure about  everything  it freed me to enter one of the most
UKKPzn-4QA0,2133040,2139119,creative periods of my life  during the next five years i started a  company named next another company named
UKKPzn-4QA0,2139119,2144800,pixar and fell in love with an amazing  woman who would become my wife  pixar went on to create the world's
UKKPzn-4QA0,2144800,2153119,first computer animated feature film toy  story and is now the most successful  animation studio in the world
UKKPzn-4QA0,2153440,2160320,in a remarkable turn of events  apple bought next and i returned to  apple and the technology we developed it
UKKPzn-4QA0,2160320,2165760,next is at the heart of apple's current  renaissance  and loreen and i have a wonderful family
UKKPzn-4QA0,2165760,2171680,together  i'm pretty sure  none of this would have happened if i  hadn't been fired from apple
UKKPzn-4QA0,2171680,2178079,it was awful tasting medicine but i  guess the patient needed it  sometime life sometimes life's going to
UKKPzn-4QA0,2178079,2183119,hit you in the head with a brick  don't lose faith  i'm convinced that the only thing that
UKKPzn-4QA0,2183119,2188240,kept me going was that i loved what i  did you've got to find what you love and
UKKPzn-4QA0,2188240,2193280,that is as true for work as it is for  your lovers  your work is going to fill a large part
UKKPzn-4QA0,2193280,2199440,of your life and the only way to be  truly satisfied is to do what you  believe is great work and the only way
UKKPzn-4QA0,2199440,2205440,to do great work is to love what you do  if you haven't found it yet keep looking
UKKPzn-4QA0,2205440,2211760,and don't settle  as with all matters of the heart you'll  know when you find it and like any great
UKKPzn-4QA0,2211760,2217200,relationship it just gets better and  better as the years roll on so keep  looking
UKKPzn-4QA0,2217200,2222880,don't settle  my third story
UKKPzn-4QA0,2222880,2229040,is about death  when i was 17 i read a quote that went  something like
UKKPzn-4QA0,2229040,2235040,if you live each day as if it was your  last someday you'll most certainly be  right
UKKPzn-4QA0,2235040,2240160,it made an impression on me and since  then for the past 33 years i've looked
UKKPzn-4QA0,2240160,2247200,in the mirror every morning and asked  myself  if today were the last day of my life  would i want to do what i am about to do
UKKPzn-4QA0,2247200,2252800,today  and whenever the answer has been no for  too many days in a row i know i need to
UKKPzn-4QA0,2252800,2258720,change something  remembering that i'll be dead soon is  the most important tool i've ever
UKKPzn-4QA0,2258720,2264000,encountered to help me make the big  choices in life  because almost everything
UKKPzn-4QA0,2264000,2269200,all external expectations all pride all  fear of embarrassment or failure these
UKKPzn-4QA0,2269200,2274960,things just fall away in the face of  death  leaving only what is truly important
UKKPzn-4QA0,2274960,2282320,remembering that you are going to die is  the best way i know to avoid the trap of  thinking you have something to lose
UKKPzn-4QA0,2282320,2288480,you are already naked there is no reason  not to follow your heart
UKKPzn-4QA0,2288560,2295040,no one wants to die  even people who want to go to heaven  don't want to die to get there
UKKPzn-4QA0,2295040,2301040,and yet  death is the destination we all share  no one has ever escaped it
UKKPzn-4QA0,2301040,2307839,and that is as it should be because  death is very likely the single best  invention of life
UKKPzn-4QA0,2307839,2315359,it's life's change agent it clears out  the old to make way for the new  right now the new is you
UKKPzn-4QA0,2315359,2321200,but someday not too long from now you  will gradually become the old and be  cleared away
UKKPzn-4QA0,2321200,2328240,sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite  true  your time is limited so don't waste it
UKKPzn-4QA0,2328240,2334240,living someone else's life  don't be trapped by dogma which is  living with the results of other
UKKPzn-4QA0,2334240,2340640,people's thinking  don't let the noise of others opinions  drown out your own inner voice and most
UKKPzn-4QA0,2340640,2347040,important have the courage to follow  your heart and intuition  they somehow already know what you truly
UKKPzn-4QA0,2347040,2352640,want to become  everything else is secondary
UKKPzn-4QA0,2352640,2356799,stay hungry stay foolish
UKKPzn-4QA0,2357839,2363599,today  i want to talk about purpose  [Music]  but i'm not here to give you the
UKKPzn-4QA0,2363599,2368880,standard commencement about finding your  purpose we're millennials we try to do
UKKPzn-4QA0,2368880,2377760,that instinctively  instead i'm here to tell you that  finding your purpose isn't enough
UKKPzn-4QA0,2377760,2383200,the challenge for our generation is to  create a world where everyone has a
UKKPzn-4QA0,2383200,2388800,sense of purpose  one of my favorite stories
UKKPzn-4QA0,2388800,2395040,is when jfk went to go visit the nasa  space center and he saw a janitor  holding a broom and he asked him what he
UKKPzn-4QA0,2395040,2401839,was doing and the janitor replied mr  president i'm helping put a man on the  moon
UKKPzn-4QA0,2401920,2408319,purpose  is that feeling  that you are a part of something bigger  than yourself
UKKPzn-4QA0,2408319,2413359,that you are needed and that you have  something better ahead to work for
UKKPzn-4QA0,2413359,2419280,purpose is what creates true happiness  and today i want to talk about three
UKKPzn-4QA0,2419280,2425280,ways that we can create a world where  everyone has a sense of purpose
UKKPzn-4QA0,2425280,2431920,by taking on big meaningful projects  together  by redefining equality so everyone has
UKKPzn-4QA0,2431920,2439440,the freedom to pursue their purpose  and by building community  all across the world
UKKPzn-4QA0,2439440,2445680,so first let's take on big meaningful  projects  our generation is going to have to deal
UKKPzn-4QA0,2445680,2450800,with tens of millions of jobs replaced  by automation like self-driving cars and  trucks
UKKPzn-4QA0,2450800,2457520,but we have the potential to do so much  more than that  every generation has its defining works
UKKPzn-4QA0,2457520,2464319,more than three hundred thousand people  work to put that man on the moon  including that janitor  millions of volunteers immunize children
UKKPzn-4QA0,2464319,2470880,around the world against polio and  millions of more people built the hoover  dam and other great projects
UKKPzn-4QA0,2470880,2476000,and now it's our generation's turn  to do great things
UKKPzn-4QA0,2476000,2482800,now i know maybe you're thinking i don't  know how to build a dam  i don't know how to get a million people  involved in anything
UKKPzn-4QA0,2482800,2489839,well  let me tell you a secret  no one does when they begin
UKKPzn-4QA0,2489839,2495440,ideas don't come out fully formed  they only become clear as you work on
UKKPzn-4QA0,2495440,2501920,them  you just have to get started  movies and pop culture just get this all
UKKPzn-4QA0,2501920,2508640,wrong  the idea of a single eureka moment is a  dangerous lie it makes us feel
UKKPzn-4QA0,2508640,2514800,inadequate because we feel like we  haven't had ours yet  and it prevents people with seeds of
UKKPzn-4QA0,2514800,2519839,good ideas from ever getting started in  the first place  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,2519839,2525760,in our society  we often don't take on big things  because we're so afraid of making  mistakes
UKKPzn-4QA0,2525760,2532560,that we ignore all the things wrong  today if we do nothing  the reality is
UKKPzn-4QA0,2532560,2538079,anything we do today  is going to have some issues in the  future
UKKPzn-4QA0,2538079,2544160,but that can't stop us from getting  started  so what are we waiting for
UKKPzn-4QA0,2544160,2550640,it is time for our generation defining  great works  how about stopping climate change before
UKKPzn-4QA0,2550640,2557200,we destroy the planet and getting  millions of people involved  manufacturing
UKKPzn-4QA0,2557200,2563119,and installing solar panels  how about curing all diseases and  getting people involved by asking
UKKPzn-4QA0,2563119,2568560,volunteers to share their health data  track their health data and share their  genomes  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,2568560,2574560,these achievements are all within our  reach  let's do them all in a way that gives
UKKPzn-4QA0,2574560,2580480,everyone in our society a role  let's do big things not just to create
UKKPzn-4QA0,2580480,2586800,progress but to create purpose  the second is redefining
UKKPzn-4QA0,2586800,2593760,our idea of equality so everyone has the  freedom to pursue their purpose
UKKPzn-4QA0,2593760,2599520,now  many of our parents had stable jobs  throughout their careers but in our  generation we're all a little
UKKPzn-4QA0,2599520,2606000,entrepreneurial whether we're starting  our own projects or finding our role in  another one  and you know that's great because our
UKKPzn-4QA0,2606000,2611440,culture of entrepreneurship is how we  create so much progress
UKKPzn-4QA0,2611760,2618240,an entrepreneurial culture thrives when  it is easy to try lots of new ideas
UKKPzn-4QA0,2618240,2623520,facebook wasn't the first thing i built  i also built chat systems and games
UKKPzn-4QA0,2623520,2630079,study tools and music players and i'm  not alone  jk rowling got rejected 12 times before
UKKPzn-4QA0,2630079,2636960,she finally wrote and published harry  potter  the greatest successes come from having
UKKPzn-4QA0,2636960,2642720,the freedom to fail  now  today
UKKPzn-4QA0,2642720,2650240,we have a level of wealth and equality  that hurts everyone  when you don't have the freedom
UKKPzn-4QA0,2650240,2656560,to take your idea and turn it into a  historic enterprise  we all lose
UKKPzn-4QA0,2656560,2663440,and right now today our society is way  over indexed on rewarding people when  they're successful and we don't do
UKKPzn-4QA0,2663440,2669920,nearly enough to make sure that everyone  can take lots of different shots  now let's face it
UKKPzn-4QA0,2669920,2675200,there is something wrong with our system  when i can leave here and make billions
UKKPzn-4QA0,2675200,2681119,of dollars in 10 years  while millions of students can't even  afford to pay off their loans let alone
UKKPzn-4QA0,2681119,2687520,start a business  i know a lot of entrepreneurs  and i don't know a single person who
UKKPzn-4QA0,2687520,2692720,gave up on starting a business because  they were worried they might not make  enough money
UKKPzn-4QA0,2692720,2698480,but i know too many people who haven't  had the chance to pursue their dreams  because they didn't have a cushion to
UKKPzn-4QA0,2698480,2703920,fall back on if they failed  [Music]  every generation
UKKPzn-4QA0,2703920,2710079,expands its definition of equality  previous generations fought for the vote
UKKPzn-4QA0,2710079,2715680,and civil rights  they had the new deal  and great society
UKKPzn-4QA0,2715680,2722640,and now it's time for our generation to  define a new social contract
UKKPzn-4QA0,2722640,2729119,we should have a society that measures  progress  not just by economic metrics like gdp
UKKPzn-4QA0,2729119,2734960,but by how many of us have a role we  find meaningful  we should explore ideas like universal
UKKPzn-4QA0,2734960,2740559,basic income to make sure that everyone  has a cushion to try new ideas
UKKPzn-4QA0,2740720,2747119,and we're all going to make mistakes  so we need a society that's less focused  on locking us up and stigmatizing us
UKKPzn-4QA0,2747119,2754000,when we do  and as our technology keeps on evolving  we need a society that is more focused
UKKPzn-4QA0,2754000,2760560,on providing continuous education  through our lives and yes  giving everyone the freedom to pursue
UKKPzn-4QA0,2760560,2765920,purpose isn't going to be free  people like me should pay for it
UKKPzn-4QA0,2765920,2772480,and a lot of you are going to do really  well and you should too  but it's not just about giving money
UKKPzn-4QA0,2772480,2779040,you can also give time  and i promise you  if you just take an hour to a week
UKKPzn-4QA0,2779040,2784079,that's all it takes to give someone a  hand and help them reach their potential
UKKPzn-4QA0,2784079,2791119,now maybe you're thinking that's a lot  of time i'm not sure if i have that much  time  i used to think that
UKKPzn-4QA0,2791119,2796960,we can all make time to give someone a  hand  let's give everyone the freedom to
UKKPzn-4QA0,2796960,2802640,pursue purpose not just because it's the  right thing to do but because when more  people can turn their dreams into
UKKPzn-4QA0,2802640,2811119,something great we are all better for it  purpose doesn't only come from work
UKKPzn-4QA0,2811119,2817599,the third way  we can create a sense of purpose for  everyone is by building community
UKKPzn-4QA0,2817599,2824720,and in our generation when we say  purpose for everyone  we mean everyone in the world
UKKPzn-4QA0,2824960,2830960,in a recent survey of millennials around  the world  asking what most defines our identity
UKKPzn-4QA0,2830960,2838880,the most popular answer wasn't  nationality ethnicity or religion  it was citizen of the world
UKKPzn-4QA0,2838880,2844319,that's a big deal  every generation expands the circle of
UKKPzn-4QA0,2844319,2850240,people we consider one of us  and in our generation that now includes
UKKPzn-4QA0,2850240,2855760,the whole world  we understand that the great arc of
UKKPzn-4QA0,2855760,2861040,human history bends towards people  coming together in ever greater numbers
UKKPzn-4QA0,2861040,2867040,from tribes to cities to nations to  achieve things that we could not on our  own
UKKPzn-4QA0,2867040,2873040,we get that our greatest opportunities  are now global  we can be the generation that ends  poverty
UKKPzn-4QA0,2873040,2879839,that ends disease  and we get that our greatest challenges  need global responses too
UKKPzn-4QA0,2879839,2884880,no country can fight climate change  alone or prevent pandemics
UKKPzn-4QA0,2884880,2890960,progress now requires coming together  not just as cities or nations but also
UKKPzn-4QA0,2890960,2898079,as a global community  [Music]  but we live in an unstable time
UKKPzn-4QA0,2898079,2904800,there are people left behind by  globalization  across the whole world  and it's tough to care about people in
UKKPzn-4QA0,2904800,2912400,other places when we don't first feel  good about our lives here at home  the purpose and stability in our own
UKKPzn-4QA0,2912400,2917680,lives  that we can start to open up and care  about everyone else too
UKKPzn-4QA0,2917680,2922880,and the best way to do that  is to start building local communities
UKKPzn-4QA0,2922880,2929200,right now  change starts local
UKKPzn-4QA0,2929200,2934240,even global change starts small with  people like us
UKKPzn-4QA0,2934240,2939920,in our generation  the struggle of whether we connect more  whether we achieve our greatest
UKKPzn-4QA0,2939920,2944960,opportunities comes down to this  your ability
UKKPzn-4QA0,2944960,2954680,to build communities  and create a world where every single  person has a sense of purpose
UKKPzn-4QA0,2956400,2962880,i i try to think what did i say that  could actually be helpful or useful to  you in the future  and uh i thought perhaps uh tell the
UKKPzn-4QA0,2962880,2969280,story of how i sort of came to be here  how did some of these things happen  and and maybe there's some lessons there
UKKPzn-4QA0,2969280,2976400,um because i often find myself wondering  how did this happen  so  when i was young i i
UKKPzn-4QA0,2976400,2983440,i didn't really know what i was going to  do uh when i got older  but but then eventually i thought that  the idea of inventing things would be
UKKPzn-4QA0,2983440,2989760,would be really cool  the reason i thought that was because  i i read a quote from author c clock
UKKPzn-4QA0,2989760,2995359,which said that  efficiently advanced technology is  indistinguishable from magic
UKKPzn-4QA0,2995359,3001520,and and that's really true  if you think if you go back  say 300 years the things that we take
UKKPzn-4QA0,3001520,3008000,for granted today  would be you'd be burned at the stake  for you know being able to fly
UKKPzn-4QA0,3008000,3014640,that's crazy  being able to see over long distances  being able to communicate having um
UKKPzn-4QA0,3014640,3019920,effectively  with with the internet  a group mind of sorts
UKKPzn-4QA0,3019920,3024960,and having access to all the world's  information  instantly from almost anywhere in the  earth
UKKPzn-4QA0,3024960,3032240,this is stuff that that really would be  magic it would be considered magic  in times past in fact i think it
UKKPzn-4QA0,3032240,3038480,actually goes beyond that because there  are many things that we take for granted  today that weren't even imagined
UKKPzn-4QA0,3038480,3043839,in times past they weren't even in the  realm of magic  so that it actually goes goes beyond  that
UKKPzn-4QA0,3043839,3049599,so i thought well  you know if if i can do  some of those things basically if i can
UKKPzn-4QA0,3049599,3055520,advance technology then that's like  magic and that would be really cool and  i always had sort of a slight
UKKPzn-4QA0,3055520,3060640,existential crisis because i was trying  to figure out what does it all mean like  what's the purpose of things
UKKPzn-4QA0,3060640,3065760,and i came to the conclusion that if if  we can advance the the knowledge of the
UKKPzn-4QA0,3065760,3072800,world if we can do things that expand  the scope and and scale of consciousness  then we're better able to ask the right
UKKPzn-4QA0,3072800,3077920,questions and become more enlightened  and and that's really the only way  forward
UKKPzn-4QA0,3077920,3084480,so i i studied  physics and business because i figured  in order to do a lot of these things you
UKKPzn-4QA0,3084480,3090640,need to  know how the universe works and you need  to know how  how the economy works
UKKPzn-4QA0,3090640,3096880,and you also need to be able to bring a  lot of people together to work with you  to create something because it's very  difficult to do something as as an
UKKPzn-4QA0,3096880,3102880,individual if it's if it's a significant  technology  i originally came out to to california
UKKPzn-4QA0,3102880,3110160,to  try to figure out  how to improve the  energy density of of electric vehicles
UKKPzn-4QA0,3110160,3116319,basically to try to figure out if there  was an advanced capacitor that that  could serve as an alternative to  batteries
UKKPzn-4QA0,3116319,3121440,and um that was in 95 and  that's also when the internet
UKKPzn-4QA0,3121440,3128720,started to happen  and it i i thought well i can either  pursue this tech this technology where
UKKPzn-4QA0,3128720,3134240,success maybe may not be one of the  possible outcomes which is always tricky  or
UKKPzn-4QA0,3134240,3140880,participate in the internet and and be  part of it so i decided to to drop out  did some internet stuff what one of
UKKPzn-4QA0,3140880,3146400,which was paypal and and i think maybe  it's helpful to  say one of the things that was important
UKKPzn-4QA0,3146400,3153359,then in the creation of paypal  was uh was kind of how it started  because  the initial thought was with paypal was
UKKPzn-4QA0,3153359,3158480,to create an agglomeration of financial  services so you have one place where
UKKPzn-4QA0,3158480,3163920,all your financial services needs would  be seamlessly integrated and and work  smoothly and then we had like a little
UKKPzn-4QA0,3163920,3170800,feature which was to do email payments  and whenever we'd show the show the  system off to someone uh we'd show the
UKKPzn-4QA0,3170800,3176079,hard part which was the um  the agglomeration of financial services  which was quite difficult to put
UKKPzn-4QA0,3176079,3181520,together nobody was interested then we'd  show people email payments which was  actually quite easy and everybody was
UKKPzn-4QA0,3181520,3187520,interested so i think it's important to  to take feedback from your environment  you know it's it you want to be as
UKKPzn-4QA0,3187520,3193839,closed loop as possible it's so we focus  on email payments and really try to make  that work and that's what really got
UKKPzn-4QA0,3193839,3199839,things to take off  but but if we hadn't if we hadn't  responded to what people said then we we
UKKPzn-4QA0,3199839,3205680,probably would not have been successful  so it's important to look for things  like that and and focus on them when
UKKPzn-4QA0,3205680,3212400,when you when you see them and get  correct your prior assumptions  going from paypal
UKKPzn-4QA0,3212400,3218960,what what are some of the  the other problems that uh are likely to  most affect the future of humanity
UKKPzn-4QA0,3218960,3225680,it really wasn't from the perspective of  what what's the rancor best way to to  make money um which which is which is
UKKPzn-4QA0,3225680,3231440,okay but  what i think is going to most affect the  future humanity so i think the biggest
UKKPzn-4QA0,3231440,3237599,terrestrial problem we've got is a  sustainable energy but the production  and consumption of energy in a
UKKPzn-4QA0,3237599,3243359,sustainable manner if we don't solve  that this the sensory is the century  we're we're in deep trouble
UKKPzn-4QA0,3243359,3248800,and then the the other one being the  extension of life beyond earth to make  life multi-planetary
UKKPzn-4QA0,3248800,3253920,so that's the basis for  the latter is the basis force for spacex
UKKPzn-4QA0,3253920,3262079,and the former is the basis for  tesla and solar city and and when i  started spacex i it was actually
UKKPzn-4QA0,3262079,3268240,initially  i thought that  well there's there's no way one could  possibly start a rocket company i wasn't
UKKPzn-4QA0,3268240,3274480,that crazy  but but then  i thought well what is a way to  increase nasa's budget that was actually
UKKPzn-4QA0,3274480,3280799,my initial goal  so  i i thought well if we can do a low-cost  mission to mars something called mars
UKKPzn-4QA0,3280799,3287599,oasis which would land seeds with with  dehydrate wood with seasoned dehydrated  nutrient gel and you hydrate them upon
UKKPzn-4QA0,3287599,3294559,landing and then you'd have this great  sort of money shot of green plants on a  red background and the public tends to
UKKPzn-4QA0,3294559,3300880,respond to um  precedents and superlatives  and this would be the first life on mars
UKKPzn-4QA0,3300880,3306559,the furthest that life's ever traveled  as far as we know  and and i thought well that that would  get people really excited
UKKPzn-4QA0,3306559,3312559,and and and therefore increase at nasa's  budget so so obviously the financial  outcome from such a mission would
UKKPzn-4QA0,3312559,3317839,probably be zero so anything better than  that was on the upside
UKKPzn-4QA0,3317839,3324880,so i actually went to i went to russia  three times to look at buying a  refurbished icbm because that that was
UKKPzn-4QA0,3324880,3331760,the best deal  and uh i can tell you it was very weird  going there in 2000 late 2001 2002
UKKPzn-4QA0,3331760,3337280,going to the russian rocket forces and  saying i'd like to buy  two of your biggest rockets
UKKPzn-4QA0,3337280,3342480,but you can keep the nuke  that's a lot more  um
UKKPzn-4QA0,3342480,3347520,and  that was 10 years ago i guess so  they thought i was crazy but but i did
UKKPzn-4QA0,3347520,3354480,have money so that was  that was okay  after making several trips to to russia
UKKPzn-4QA0,3354480,3360720,i came to the conclusion that  that actually uh  my initial impression was was wrong
UKKPzn-4QA0,3360720,3366480,about  because my initial thought was well  that there's not enough will to explore
UKKPzn-4QA0,3366480,3373359,and expand beyond earth and have a mars  base and that kind of thing but i can't  conclusion that that was wrong um in
UKKPzn-4QA0,3373359,3379680,fact there's plenty of will particularly  in the united states  because the united states  is a nation of explorers of people who
UKKPzn-4QA0,3379680,3384720,came here from from other parts of the  world i think  the united states really
UKKPzn-4QA0,3384720,3391760,a  distillation of the spirit of human  exploration  but if people think it's impossible then
UKKPzn-4QA0,3391760,3397119,or it's going to completely break the  federal budget then they're not going to  do it  so
UKKPzn-4QA0,3397119,3404400,after  my third trip i said okay  what we really need to do here is try to  solve the space transport problem
UKKPzn-4QA0,3404400,3411839,and uh and started spacex  and uh this this was against the advice  of pretty much everyone i talked to
UKKPzn-4QA0,3411839,3418799,but one friend made me sit down and  watch a bunch of videos of rockets  blowing up let me tell you he wasn't far  wrong i think it was it was tough going
UKKPzn-4QA0,3418799,3424480,there in the beginning because i'd never  built anything physical i mean i built  like little model rockets as a kid and
UKKPzn-4QA0,3424480,3429680,that kind of thing but  um i never had a company that built  anything physical so i'd figure out how
UKKPzn-4QA0,3429680,3436720,to how to do all these things and and  bring together the right team of people  and so we we did all that and and then
UKKPzn-4QA0,3436720,3443599,failed three times um  it it was tough tough going  because thing about a rocket is that the
UKKPzn-4QA0,3443599,3449359,the passing grade is a hundred percent  and uh  you you don't get to
UKKPzn-4QA0,3449359,3456000,actually test the rocket in the real  environment that it's going to be in  so i think so the best analogy for for
UKKPzn-4QA0,3456000,3462000,rocket engineering is  it's like if you want to create a really  complicated bit of software
UKKPzn-4QA0,3462000,3467359,you could you can't run the software as  an integrated hole and you can't run it  on the computer it's intended to run on
UKKPzn-4QA0,3467359,3473440,but the first time you put it all  together and write it on that computer  it must run with no bugs  that's that's basically the essence of
UKKPzn-4QA0,3473440,3479680,it so we missed the mark there  that the first launch i was picking up  bits of rocket near the
UKKPzn-4QA0,3479680,3484880,the launch site was bizarre and uh  but we we learned with with each
UKKPzn-4QA0,3484880,3492799,successive flight and uh and were able  to with uh especially with the fourth  flight in 2008 uh reached orbit and that
UKKPzn-4QA0,3492799,3498720,was also with the last bit of money that  we had  thank goodness uh that that happened i
UKKPzn-4QA0,3498720,3504319,think the saying is fourth times the  charm  so that's we got the falcon one two  orbit
UKKPzn-4QA0,3504319,3509839,and then  uh began to scale that up to to the  falcon 9 which is
UKKPzn-4QA0,3509839,3515119,about an order of magnitude more a  thrust it's uh around a million pounds  of thrust
UKKPzn-4QA0,3515119,3521359,and  we managed to get that to orbit and then  uh developed dragon spacecraft
UKKPzn-4QA0,3521359,3527520,which  recently was able to dock and return to  earth from the space station
UKKPzn-4QA0,3527520,3532559,that was a white knuckled event  so yeah it's a huge relief still can't
UKKPzn-4QA0,3532559,3538079,quite believe it actually happened  but there's a lot more that that that  must happen beyond this in order for
UKKPzn-4QA0,3538079,3544079,humanity to be to become a space faring  civilization ultimately  a multi-planet species and that's
UKKPzn-4QA0,3544079,3549200,something i think it's it's it's vitally  important and and i hope um  that that some of you will will
UKKPzn-4QA0,3549200,3554480,participate in in that either at spacex  or at other companies because it's just  really one of the
UKKPzn-4QA0,3554480,3561040,the most important things for the  preservation and extension of  consciousness  it's worth noting as i'm sure people are
UKKPzn-4QA0,3561040,3567119,aware that the earth has been around for  four billion years  and civilization at least in terms of
UKKPzn-4QA0,3567119,3573280,having  writing has been around for 10 000 years  and that's been generous and i think um
UKKPzn-4QA0,3573280,3579040,i'm actually i'm actually fairly  optimistic about the future of earth so  i don't want to  i don't want to sort of people to have
UKKPzn-4QA0,3579040,3585359,the wrong impression that i think we're  all about to die  i think things will most likely be okay  for a lo for a long time on earth
UKKPzn-4QA0,3585359,3590559,but not not for sure but most likely  but but even if it's if it's sort of 99
UKKPzn-4QA0,3590559,3596880,likely one a one percent chance is still  it's still worth spending a fair bit of  effort to ensure that we have um we've
UKKPzn-4QA0,3596880,3602079,backed up the biosphere you know  planetary redundancy if you will  and so i think i think it's really
UKKPzn-4QA0,3602079,3608640,really quite important and in order to  do that  there's a breakthrough that needs to  occur which is to create a rapidly and
UKKPzn-4QA0,3608640,3613920,completely reusable um transport system  to mars which which is one of those
UKKPzn-4QA0,3613920,3619520,things that's right on the borderline of  of impossible  um but that that's sort of the the thing
UKKPzn-4QA0,3619520,3625119,that we're  we're going to try to achieve there with  with with spacex
UKKPzn-4QA0,3625119,3632559,and then on the on the on the tesla  front uh the goal with tesla was really  to try to show that what electric cars
UKKPzn-4QA0,3632559,3637599,can do because people had the wrong  impression we had to change people's  perception of an electric vehicle
UKKPzn-4QA0,3637599,3643520,because they used to think of it as  something that was slow and  ugly and had low range and like a golf
UKKPzn-4QA0,3643520,3649359,cart  and and so that's why we created the  tesla roadster to show that you can be  fast
UKKPzn-4QA0,3649359,3654799,attractive and and long range and it's  amazing how  even though you can show that something
UKKPzn-4QA0,3654799,3660240,works on paper you know and the  calculations are very clear  until you actually have the physical
UKKPzn-4QA0,3660240,3666160,object and they can they can drive it it  doesn't really sink in for people  um and so that that i think is is
UKKPzn-4QA0,3666160,3671839,something worth noting if if you're  gonna create a company the first thing  you should try to do is create a working  prototype
UKKPzn-4QA0,3671839,3678400,um you know everything everything looks  great on powerpoint but if you have if  you have an actual demonstration article
UKKPzn-4QA0,3678400,3684319,even if it's in primitive form that's  much much more effective for convincing  people
UKKPzn-4QA0,3684319,3691599,i i think the the overarching point i  want to make is that um  you guys are the magicians of the 21st
UKKPzn-4QA0,3691599,3698240,century they're like anything holds you  back imagination is is the limit  um and
UKKPzn-4QA0,3698240,3714230,go out there and create some magic thank  you  [Music]
UKKPzn-4QA0,3716960,3719039,you
