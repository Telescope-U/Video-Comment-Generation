crzh8JTkQs4,33040,36000,deserted and destroyed in december last
crzh8JTkQs4,36000,38640,year tigran fighters loyal to the tigrai
crzh8JTkQs4,38640,41360,people's liberation front or tplf
crzh8JTkQs4,41360,44079,attacked the border town of abbala and
crzh8JTkQs4,44079,45760,they left their mark
crzh8JTkQs4,45760,48000,abbala used to have a mixed population
crzh8JTkQs4,48000,50559,of ethnic degrees and afar
crzh8JTkQs4,50559,52640,in the days leading up to the tplf
crzh8JTkQs4,52640,55039,attack witnesses tell us fighting had
crzh8JTkQs4,55039,57360,already broken out along ethnic lines
crzh8JTkQs4,57360,60160,between afar residents afar militia and
crzh8JTkQs4,60160,64239,local tigrans causing many to leave
crzh8JTkQs4,64239,66159,as you can see the destruction is
crzh8JTkQs4,66159,67360,systematic
crzh8JTkQs4,67360,69119,every house on this road has been
crzh8JTkQs4,69119,71439,damaged the tigran fighters went from
crzh8JTkQs4,71439,73760,door to door looted and damaged
crzh8JTkQs4,73760,76080,everything they could find
crzh8JTkQs4,76080,78320,tahir hassan the mayor of habala has
crzh8JTkQs4,78320,80960,since returned together with armed men
crzh8JTkQs4,80960,83200,an attempt to reinstate some sense of
crzh8JTkQs4,83200,86200,security
crzh8JTkQs4,89040,90479,like rain
crzh8JTkQs4,90479,94479,more than 225 people died
crzh8JTkQs4,94479,96479,they killed the elderly in their homes
crzh8JTkQs4,96479,98880,and others while they were escaping
crzh8JTkQs4,98880,101040,they
crzh8JTkQs4,104399,107759,they also raped several women he says
crzh8JTkQs4,107759,109920,the tplf and the government declared a
crzh8JTkQs4,109920,112479,ceasefire it's fragile but it's been in
crzh8JTkQs4,112479,115680,four since march in late april tplf
crzh8JTkQs4,115680,118000,fighters withdrew from abbala and other
crzh8JTkQs4,118000,120719,territories in the afar region allowing
crzh8JTkQs4,120719,123439,aid convoys into the tigray region
crzh8JTkQs4,123439,126079,but abbala's mayor taiher sen says the
crzh8JTkQs4,126079,129360,tplf never really left
crzh8JTkQs4,129360,131760,they say we're fully withdrawn from afar
crzh8JTkQs4,131760,134400,but they haven't really fully left
crzh8JTkQs4,134400,136319,the hill that you see there they're up
crzh8JTkQs4,136319,137280,there
crzh8JTkQs4,137280,138480,they will come back once they have
crzh8JTkQs4,138480,140560,received enough food aid
crzh8JTkQs4,140560,142400,once they had enough of it they will use
crzh8JTkQs4,142400,144239,it for war
crzh8JTkQs4,144239,146560,at the nearby cemetery we meet mohamed
crzh8JTkQs4,146560,148800,hussein a local health official who has
crzh8JTkQs4,148800,151360,helped very close to 60 bodies
crzh8JTkQs4,151360,153040,among them were several children he
crzh8JTkQs4,153040,155519,tells us
crzh8JTkQs4,166640,168560,but it's not just lives that have been
crzh8JTkQs4,168560,169519,lost
crzh8JTkQs4,169519,172080,local infrastructure lies in ruins as
crzh8JTkQs4,172080,174319,well
crzh8JTkQs4,175120,176959,they destroyed the hospital
crzh8JTkQs4,176959,178879,everything that's useful the x-ray
crzh8JTkQs4,178879,181680,machine the chem lab and the laboratory
crzh8JTkQs4,181680,183360,they took everything and they broke the
crzh8JTkQs4,183360,185519,rest
crzh8JTkQs4,185519,187519,the fighting has caused a rift between
crzh8JTkQs4,187519,190000,the two communities both now accuse each
crzh8JTkQs4,190000,192000,other of massacres destruction and
crzh8JTkQs4,192000,195920,looting we found signs of tplf actions
crzh8JTkQs4,195920,198480,but decrying witnesses also made claims
crzh8JTkQs4,198480,200720,of afar militia aggressions they say
crzh8JTkQs4,200720,202800,they targeted and killed several tigran
crzh8JTkQs4,202800,205200,residents before transporting several
crzh8JTkQs4,205200,208159,thousand to the regional capital samara
crzh8JTkQs4,208159,210480,the head of the unhcr's field office in
crzh8JTkQs4,210480,213200,samara confirmed that around 8 000
crzh8JTkQs4,213200,214560,people have been held at a
crzh8JTkQs4,214560,216959,government-run camp meant to accommodate
crzh8JTkQs4,216959,220879,about 1 500 people based on a
crzh8JTkQs4,220879,222959,national and international standards
crzh8JTkQs4,222959,224799,that should not that's that that should
crzh8JTkQs4,224799,227360,not be living con living human
crzh8JTkQs4,227360,229760,conditions he says among those detained
crzh8JTkQs4,229760,232879,are about 1 200 children many suffering
crzh8JTkQs4,232879,234480,from malnourishment
crzh8JTkQs4,234480,236879,we try to gain access to the camp but
crzh8JTkQs4,236879,239120,we're denied by local authorities who
crzh8JTkQs4,239120,242400,also refused to grant us interviews
crzh8JTkQs4,242400,244560,we did however manage to hear from one
crzh8JTkQs4,244560,246959,of the people in the camp he sent us
crzh8JTkQs4,246959,249599,these pictures he told us via phone that
crzh8JTkQs4,249599,251599,people are suffering from diseases like
crzh8JTkQs4,251599,254400,scabies diarrhea and pneumonia that
crzh8JTkQs4,254400,256560,there is not enough food and no medical
crzh8JTkQs4,256560,259359,care he says 70 people including five
crzh8JTkQs4,259359,262079,children have died since december due to
crzh8JTkQs4,262079,265440,lack of medicines and food
crzh8JTkQs4,265440,267360,no one knows when the border towns
crzh8JTkQs4,267360,269040,residents will return
crzh8JTkQs4,269040,271520,or if they will ever get to call abbala
crzh8JTkQs4,271520,274080,their home again
crzh8JTkQs4,274080,275840,since the outbreak of the conflict human
crzh8JTkQs4,275840,277680,rights groups have reported atrocities
crzh8JTkQs4,277680,280000,committed by both rebel groups and the
crzh8JTkQs4,280000,281600,ethiopian army
crzh8JTkQs4,281600,283600,journalist khaleda wan johi in the
crzh8JTkQs4,283600,285680,ethiopian capital addis ababa has an
crzh8JTkQs4,285680,287840,update on the latest mass killing in
crzh8JTkQs4,287840,290160,oromium
crzh8JTkQs4,290160,292639,well at the moment what we know is
crzh8JTkQs4,292639,294000,the government says it's still working
crzh8JTkQs4,294000,295840,on investigating what really happened in
crzh8JTkQs4,295840,297440,the roman region where we've seen people
crzh8JTkQs4,297440,299440,especially from the amhara ethnic group
crzh8JTkQs4,299440,301520,having been targeted and uh the
crzh8JTkQs4,301520,303440,government says it uh it has security
crzh8JTkQs4,303440,305440,under control and don't ensure that uh
crzh8JTkQs4,305440,307120,the region there is really under under
crzh8JTkQs4,307120,309520,control um it is one of the conflicts
crzh8JTkQs4,309520,310800,that the government is really battling
crzh8JTkQs4,310800,312400,with alongside the other one in the
crzh8JTkQs4,312400,314720,northern region and at the moment uh we
crzh8JTkQs4,314720,316720,we just have both sides um really
crzh8JTkQs4,316720,318800,blaming each other we've seen the the
crzh8JTkQs4,318800,320880,the side of of the rebels the roman
crzh8JTkQs4,320880,322720,liberation army saying that it's not
crzh8JTkQs4,322720,324639,they're not responsible uh blaming the
crzh8JTkQs4,324639,325840,government but the government's saying
crzh8JTkQs4,325840,327360,that as a government they cannot they
crzh8JTkQs4,327360,328639,cannot do this against their own
crzh8JTkQs4,328639,330800,citizens so that matter is under is
crzh8JTkQs4,330800,332240,under investigations right now and the
crzh8JTkQs4,332240,333680,u.n has also spoken about it with
crzh8JTkQs4,333680,335440,antonio guterres the u.s secretary
crzh8JTkQs4,335440,337280,general saying that the government needs
crzh8JTkQs4,337280,338960,to investigate and ensure that this kind
crzh8JTkQs4,338960,340080,of
crzh8JTkQs4,340080,341759,killings don't happen
crzh8JTkQs4,341759,343919,and just last week the ethiopian
crzh8JTkQs4,343919,345759,president abby ahmed said he was ready
crzh8JTkQs4,345759,347840,to consider talks with the tigray
crzh8JTkQs4,347840,350240,people's liberation front and now one of
crzh8JTkQs4,350240,352240,its partners allegedly committed this
crzh8JTkQs4,352240,354720,latest massacre does that jeopardize the
crzh8JTkQs4,354720,357919,prospect of peace talks
crzh8JTkQs4,358000,360240,well i think with uh with the aspect of
crzh8JTkQs4,360240,361600,the northern region where the government
crzh8JTkQs4,361600,363360,was talking about peace talks that that
crzh8JTkQs4,363360,364319,was
crzh8JTkQs4,364319,365600,the prime minister explained to
crzh8JTkQs4,365600,367280,parliament that the government is
crzh8JTkQs4,367280,369360,willing to look into um what is he
crzh8JTkQs4,369360,370800,called having a study committee that
crzh8JTkQs4,370800,372560,would look into the the nitty gritties
crzh8JTkQs4,372560,374319,of the details that would be required
crzh8JTkQs4,374319,375919,for p for peace talks to happen what
crzh8JTkQs4,375919,377759,would it take in a way that does not
crzh8JTkQs4,377759,379120,jeopardize national security and that
crzh8JTkQs4,379120,380800,was in particular to the issue in the
crzh8JTkQs4,380800,382479,northern region which is the tp left
crzh8JTkQs4,382479,384160,right um which is a bit separate from
crzh8JTkQs4,384160,385759,the issue of the romeo and romer region
crzh8JTkQs4,385759,387039,because these are two different regions
crzh8JTkQs4,387039,388080,so with that the government we're
crzh8JTkQs4,388080,390479,waiting for what a report from what the
crzh8JTkQs4,390479,392080,government said is a study committee
crzh8JTkQs4,392080,393520,that is supposed to give feedback to the
crzh8JTkQs4,393520,395600,government probably in some few days and
crzh8JTkQs4,395600,397840,then we'll see what what um what steps
crzh8JTkQs4,397840,399520,will the government take because already
crzh8JTkQs4,399520,401199,on the other side the tplf has preferred
crzh8JTkQs4,401199,402800,and said they want nairobi to hold the
crzh8JTkQs4,402800,405280,talks and to to facilitate but we still
crzh8JTkQs4,405280,407600,have to have the two uh what we can call
crzh8JTkQs4,407600,409120,wiring functions agreeing and getting a
crzh8JTkQs4,409120,410960,compromise so until the government um
crzh8JTkQs4,410960,412319,gets its results from the study
crzh8JTkQs4,412319,414639,committee then we can be able to know um
crzh8JTkQs4,414639,416800,what what what's what kind of peace
crzh8JTkQs4,416800,418960,talks if any they want but so far we can
crzh8JTkQs4,418960,420800,say at least there is appetite for peace
crzh8JTkQs4,420800,422639,talks which gives some hope
crzh8JTkQs4,422639,424479,okay colette johi thanks so much for
crzh8JTkQs4,424479,427479,that
