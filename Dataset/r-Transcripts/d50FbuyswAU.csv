d50FbuyswAU,10480,15854,Under a blood-red sky a terrifying figure  with a skull-like face is staring out at us.
d50FbuyswAU,16707,22960,"And it appears to be screaming in anguish.  Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"", one of the most famous  "
d50FbuyswAU,22960,29840,"images in the history of art has become for  us, a universal symbol of angst and anxiety."
d50FbuyswAU,31040,34960,Europe was at the birth of the  modern era when he painted Ths Scream  
d50FbuyswAU,34960,41280,and the image reflects the intense anxieties  that troubled the world at this time. Anxieties  
d50FbuyswAU,41280,47600,"which Edvard Munch himself found overwhelming.  The figure is in fact, not screaming at all.  "
d50FbuyswAU,48640,57840,Rather it is holding its hands over  its ears to block out the scream.
d50FbuyswAU,79680,84240,Between 1863 when Munch was born and  the years before the first world war  
d50FbuyswAU,84800,90400,European cities were going through truly  exceptional changes. Industrialisation and economic  
d50FbuyswAU,90400,98080,"shifts brought fear, obsessions, diseases, political  unrest and radicalism. Questions were being raised  "
d50FbuyswAU,98080,105600,"about society and the changing role of man within  it. About our psyche, our social responsibilities,  "
d50FbuyswAU,106160,112960,"and most radical of all - about the existence of God.  The rich were getting richer, but in Christiania  "
d50FbuyswAU,112960,119040,"(now Oslo) living and working conditions were as  bad as ever, a major cause of death and disease.  "
d50FbuyswAU,120080,126560,"Munch himself would endure a life ravaged  by madness, sickness and death. His mother  "
d50FbuyswAU,126560,132959,"and his sister both died of Tuberculosis. His  father and grandfather suffered from depression,  "
d50FbuyswAU,132960,139520,and another sister Laura from Schizophrenia.  His only brother would later die of pneumonia. 
d50FbuyswAU,140080,146192,"Always a sickly child himself, Munch turned to  drawing to keep himself occupied in his sick bed.  "
d50FbuyswAU,146582,152320,"When he later decided to become an artist his  father, a fundamental Christian, gave him no support  "
d50FbuyswAU,152320,158080,"as he considered the profession ""unholy"". He told  his son that the death of his mother and sister  "
d50FbuyswAU,158080,163600,"was ""divine punishment"" for their sins and his  traumatic childhood never left him as an adult.  "
d50FbuyswAU,164720,167600,This would have a lasting effect on Munch's work.  
d50FbuyswAU,168720,175760,"His early paintings were grounded in realism, but  in 1884 he joined Christiania's bohemian circle, "
d50FbuyswAU,175760,182319,"which was led by the anarchist writer Hans Jæger.  Jæger encouraged Munch to reject religion, break  "
d50FbuyswAU,182320,187760,"with bourgeois principles and morals, and move  away from realism to paint his own emotional  "
d50FbuyswAU,187760,193439,and psychological state. A powerful painting  dating from this period drew on the death of  
d50FbuyswAU,193440,200000,his sister and mother. It is hard now to imagine  the outrage it caused but the bourgeois Norwegians  
d50FbuyswAU,200000,205360,"despised the rough brushstrokes, scratched  surface and the deep melancholy of the piece."
d50FbuyswAU,206000,211840,The painting and the ensuing scandal  would set the tone for his future work.
d50FbuyswAU,214080,218880,"Munch was looking outside of provincial  Christiania, and on a short trip to Paris  "
d50FbuyswAU,218880,223600,"in 1885, he had the chance to see the  revolutionary work of the Impressionists.  "
d50FbuyswAU,224160,229840,Their use of colour and form was a revelation  for the young artist. Munch was always loathe 
d50FbuyswAU,229840,235920,"to admit that he was influenced by any artists,  but here we can compare Monet's solitary figure  "
d50FbuyswAU,235920,242240,"lost in thought, with Munch's own later composition  whereas Monet's paintings are a study of light on  "
d50FbuyswAU,242240,248800,"the exterior, Munch is exploring the interior life,  and already shows a preoccupation with loneliness  "
d50FbuyswAU,248800,256239,"and angst. The years in Paris were his experimental  years when Munch was finding his style, and in 1889  "
d50FbuyswAU,256239,262479,"he returned to Paris to study for three years. The Eiffel tower had just been completed, the  "
d50FbuyswAU,262480,268400,"post-impressionists were becoming established, and  Vincent van Gogh had just painted ""The Starry Night"".  "
d50FbuyswAU,269360,276400,Van Gogh's expressive and emotional brushwork  deeply influenced Munch as did his use of colour.  
d50FbuyswAU,277440,283120,Munch understood that van Gogh's posthumous fame  was thanks to a combination of his paintings  
d50FbuyswAU,283120,290080,"and his tragic personal story, and later Munch was  not averse to marketing himself as a mad genius,  "
d50FbuyswAU,290080,293439,which he understood would play  an important role in his art.  
d50FbuyswAU,294400,299600,"Mostly he was fascinated by Paul Gauguin and  the symbolists, whose ideas he would expand on.  "
d50FbuyswAU,300160,304800,Gauguin's use of heavy outline simplified  shapes and solid blocks of colour  
d50FbuyswAU,304800,310225,"would influence Munch's style. He would later  adopt the bold graphic outlines of Gauguin, "
d50FbuyswAU,310226,316240,"Van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, whose posters  were on the streets of Paris when Munch arrived.  "
d50FbuyswAU,316880,322880,"The young artist was like a sponge, soaking up  painting styles, ideas, and motifs from different  "
d50FbuyswAU,322880,330160,artists. Sometimes in a more obvious ways - and like  most artists of this period he experimented with  
d50FbuyswAU,330160,336560,"""Pointillism"". What really interested him about the  post-impressionists was their rejection of realism  "
d50FbuyswAU,336560,341600,in favor of absolute truth through their  own emotional experience and imagination.  
d50FbuyswAU,342560,348240,The unique thing about Munch was how he would take  these formal tools and ideas from French painting  
d50FbuyswAU,348240,353280,"and then combine them with a northern  sensibility, more concerned with melancholy.  "
d50FbuyswAU,354000,360320,"In 1892, he was invited to Berlin where these  psychological insights would NOT be welcome."
d50FbuyswAU,363680,369280,"Munch was invited to put on a solo show in Berlin,  but the organisers had no first-hand experience  "
d50FbuyswAU,369280,375714,of his work. Norwegian paintings of fjords were  very fashionable and they were expecting this.
d50FbuyswAU,376518,383200,"The Germans thought his work was too raw, too brutal,  and too unfinished. The show was so controversial  "
d50FbuyswAU,383200,389040,"that it would be shut down after a week. Munch  however, was delighted with the scandal, as his  "
d50FbuyswAU,389040,395200,notoriety ensured he became an overnight sensation.  In Germany. In Berlin he was friends with the  
d50FbuyswAU,395200,400560,"Swedish writer August Strindberg and, as so often  with Munch, it was literature he looked to for  "
d50FbuyswAU,400560,407520,inspiration to explain universal human experiences.  We can see his work in this period as moving away  
d50FbuyswAU,407520,412960,"from painting one image and more towards a series  of works, that can be viewed in literary terms.  "
d50FbuyswAU,413600,419360,"The masterful series he produced in the 1890s.  ""The Frieze of Life"" was intended to be seen as  "
d50FbuyswAU,419360,426240,"a poem of life, love and death. And it would be his  life's major work. The series started with six but  "
d50FbuyswAU,426240,433120,eventually grew to a total of 22 works - the scream  would be just one of them - The Impressionists  
d50FbuyswAU,433120,438400,"had of course worked in series, but more as an  observation on light and atmospheric conditions.  "
d50FbuyswAU,438960,445280,"Whereas Munch was working this way to create a  total work of art (or in german a ""Gesamtkunstwerk"")"
d50FbuyswAU,446080,451520,"Munch split the works into four themes and when  we place them together as he would have, we can  "
d50FbuyswAU,451520,460560,"see he was trying to tell a ""story"". Here we have  ""The seeds of love"", ""the passing of love"", ""anxiety'  "
d50FbuyswAU,462480,470560,"and ""death"". Around this time Munch started to produce  multiple versions of many of his paintings."
d50FbuyswAU,471194,477200,"There was a practical reason behind it, his idea was to  keep the ""Frieze of Life"" together and eventually  "
d50FbuyswAU,477200,483760,"donate them as a whole to a museum in Oslo, when he  died. So when he sold a painting he then produced  "
d50FbuyswAU,483760,489040,"a copy to replace it, to avoid breaking up  the group. The more popular the painting  "
d50FbuyswAU,489040,494960,"the more copies there are in existence. On top  of this, he had a pathological hatred of parting  "
d50FbuyswAU,494960,501840,with his paintings (which he called my children).  It was as if he couldn't bear to part with his past.  
d50FbuyswAU,505680,511360,"On the 22nd of January 1892, Munch  wrote in his diary ""I was walking  "
d50FbuyswAU,511360,516880,"down the road with two friends, when the sun  set. Suddenly the sky turned as red as blood.  "
d50FbuyswAU,518240,523760,"My friends walked on, I stood there quaking  with angst and I felt as though a vast endless  "
d50FbuyswAU,523760,530960,"scream passed through nature"". What is debatable is  whether those screams were real or psychological. "
d50FbuyswAU,531680,536240,"The idea of the figure in the landscape and  man's relationship to nature, is something  "
d50FbuyswAU,536240,540320,that Munch draws on from the romantic  tradition of the early 19th century.  
d50FbuyswAU,540960,547680,But The Scream focuses on the inner psychology of  man - in relation to nature. A painting he did just  
d50FbuyswAU,547680,553839,"a year before the scream is a rather similar image,  but with a small crowd of ghostly figures staring  "
d50FbuyswAU,553840,560320,"out at us. The painting conveys urban alienation,  the feeling that you can be all alone in a crowd.  "
d50FbuyswAU,561760,569280,And Munch's figure in The Scream expresses similar  ideas about anxiety and alienation. The disturbing  
d50FbuyswAU,569280,574480,figures are a reoccurring theme for Munch and he  used the same setting to produce other paintings.  
d50FbuyswAU,575360,580880,"This painting also has the same red and yellow  sky, mountains and fjords in the background,  "
d50FbuyswAU,580880,585600,but instead of the skeletal figure staring  out at us there is a self-portrait of Munch.
d50FbuyswAU,587760,593760,"The composition itself is simple, we can divide the  painting into the bridge, the fjords and the sky.  "
d50FbuyswAU,594640,601200,The main figure is curved and broadens out  to blend into the background. The two figures  
d50FbuyswAU,601200,605520,(his friends in the diary entry) are  vertical unlike the main figure.  
d50FbuyswAU,605520,611120,"This with the sharp diagonals of the bridge,  anchor us in the real world. The background  "
d50FbuyswAU,611120,615680,suggests the world is dissolving into  chaos and pre-figures abstract painting.  
d50FbuyswAU,617040,621920,The tiny figures are deep in conversation  and despite the chaos they are oblivious.  
d50FbuyswAU,622640,628720,"Munch underlines their emotional distance from the  protagonist by placing them at a physical distance, "
d50FbuyswAU,628720,634720,"walking away on an absolutely straight road.  The painting may look as if it is done quickly,  "
d50FbuyswAU,634720,640720,but Munch would go through meticulous preparation.  Here we see the development of the lone figure as  
d50FbuyswAU,640720,647120,"it goes from the far distance to the foreground. In his diary sketch, the violent red sky develops  "
d50FbuyswAU,647120,653279,and written to the side is his description of  that walk with his friends. The self-portrait  
d50FbuyswAU,653280,659040,"will give way to the figure we know. Note in  this sketch, one of the two background figures  "
d50FbuyswAU,659040,666320,"is not yet walking away. If we take the two figures  away completely the scene is not as claustrophobic,"
d50FbuyswAU,666320,673520,and it changes the atmosphere. Every element in the  painting is carefully planned - and even after all  
d50FbuyswAU,673520,679120,"this planning Munch made last-minute changes, as  we see with this initial sketch on the reverse."
d50FbuyswAU,681840,689676,"This 1893 painting is probably his first version of  ""The Scream"".  It is mixed media - oil tempera and pastel. "
d50FbuyswAU,690212,693990,"  This one, also dated 1893, is in pastel."
d50FbuyswAU,694478,698078,"Auctioneer: ""107 billion dollars - sold!"""
d50FbuyswAU,698800,706959,The only one in private hands. And this is a later  copy from 1910 also tempers. All the paintings are  
d50FbuyswAU,706960,712880,"done on unprimed cardboard. Munch often worked with  cheap material, first because he couldn't afford  "
d50FbuyswAU,712880,719280,"canvas, and later because the texture suited his  aesthetic. They were often glued onto wooden boards  "
d50FbuyswAU,719280,725520,"as we can see here. A treatment no longer used.  He would use diluted paint, a technique he picked  "
d50FbuyswAU,725520,731942,"up from Toulouse-Lautrec, and he deliberately  left paintings unfinished as a sort of anti-art  statement"
d50FbuyswAU,732551,737280," He wanted the cardboard to show through  the various diluted layers of pastels, to allow  "
d50FbuyswAU,737280,743331,the process to show. At times he has violently  stabbed on paint with the back of his brush.
d50FbuyswAU,744062,749680,"He never varnished his work as he liked the matte  finish, insisting varnish ""killed a painting dead""."
d50FbuyswAU,752560,757840,"Then he had something which he called ""the horse  cure"". This was basically leaving his paintings  "
d50FbuyswAU,757840,764240,"outside in the garden, in all weathers to ""fend for  themselves"". He thought his paintings should have an  "
d50FbuyswAU,764240,770800,"organic life and he wanted them to look aged. Here  we can see one of the many stains on the painting,  "
d50FbuyswAU,770800,777600,where Munch - in this case - spilled some wax on it. All of these add up to a nightmare for conservators.  
d50FbuyswAU,777746,783040,"TV NEWS:  ""Two or three armed, masked men burst into the  Munch Museum in Oslo, in broad daylight and took    "
d50FbuyswAU,783040,787759,"the paintings, as visitors watched"".  One of the ironies about the scream is that  "
d50FbuyswAU,787760,793360,when it was recovered after being stolen it was  quickly jumped upon by a small army of conservators.  
d50FbuyswAU,793360,799362,Munch however would have preferred they left  it damaged - as part of its ongoing life.
d50FbuyswAU,800824,807759," I think it is interesting, to look at possible inspiration.  Scientists have linked the sky's unnatural colours  "
d50FbuyswAU,807760,814720,"to volcanic dust from the eruption of Krakatoa in  1883, which generated incredible sunsets in Europe  "
d50FbuyswAU,814720,820800,"for months after. They have also linked it to a  phenomenon known as ""Nacreous cloud formations"",  "
d50FbuyswAU,820800,827440,"common in Norway during winter, which is when Munch painted The Scream. A possible inspiration for the  "
d50FbuyswAU,827440,834640,"figure, is this Peruvian mummy which Munch certainly  saw on display at the Paris world's fair of 1889."
d50FbuyswAU,837600,844319,"The figure itself is featureless, ungendered and  de-individualized, and perhaps one of the reasons  "
d50FbuyswAU,844320,851440,"why despite being a deeply personal painting, it  has become a universal symbol of anxiety. It is a  "
d50FbuyswAU,851440,857600,"blank page into which you can project yourself, and  so it becomes about what we the viewer bring to it.  "
d50FbuyswAU,858480,864880,"The figure is looking right at us, which pins  us down ""locking us"" into the angst-ridden scene/  "
d50FbuyswAU,866880,871280,"Barely visible on the painting,  is a pencil inscription stating  "
d50FbuyswAU,871280,876880,"""Could only have been painted by a madman"".  Infrared images show that it was Munch's  "
d50FbuyswAU,876880,882240,"handwriting, and that it was written AFTER  the painting was first exhibited in 1895.  "
d50FbuyswAU,882880,887920,"Several important critics had questioned Munch's  mental health, and it deeply hurt the artist who  "
d50FbuyswAU,887920,893839,had a morbid fear of insanity. We can look  at the later added inscription as an angry  
d50FbuyswAU,893840,900640,ironic comment from Munch. Then there is another  inscription by Munch on an earlier lithograph. 
d50FbuyswAU,900640,908141,"""I felt a huge scream through nature"" confirming that  the figure is not screaming at all, but nature around him is.  "
d50FbuyswAU,908458,912717,"What is interesting, is why Munch  was in that location in the first place."
d50FbuyswAU,915440,920000,"The setting of ""The Scream"" came about  after the artist took a scenic walk,  "
d50FbuyswAU,920000,926240,"as described in his diary. The actual place  is called Ekberg which overlooks Oslo Fjord, "
d50FbuyswAU,926240,932160,with a view towards the setting sun during  the winter months. But as so often with Munch  
d50FbuyswAU,932160,937920,"his strength is how he departs from reality.  He was not here for the scenery, but to visit  "
d50FbuyswAU,937920,942880,"his younger sister Laura, who had recently  been confined to an asylum near this spot.  "
d50FbuyswAU,943760,949561,"Munch's father had just died, and after a lifetime  of abandonment, through death and disease, "
d50FbuyswAU,949561,955935,it is not  too difficult to imagine the distress that he must  have experienced as he left his beloved sister behind.   
d50FbuyswAU,956349,962000,Her screams of terror must have haunted him  as he walked away. In a world of extreme and rapid  
d50FbuyswAU,962000,967920,"change, combined with a life of desperate anxiety  and alienation, Munch, who would have a nervous  "
d50FbuyswAU,967920,975680,"breakdown in 1908, must have felt overwhelmed, as  if his life was unravelling.  All of us in some way  "
d50FbuyswAU,975680,981450,"understand the desperate feeling Munch must have  had, of wanting to block out all of this noise."
d50FbuyswAU,984240,988880,"i know quite a lot about art, but next  to nothing about wine. But I'm learning  "
d50FbuyswAU,988880,994400,"about wine, the way I learn about art, by  trying new things to expand my horizons.  "
