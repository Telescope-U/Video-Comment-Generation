FR8iIMPNqYk,799,3040,this is the new bugatti shoe on super
FR8iIMPNqYk,3040,5040,sport and it's a little bit like
FR8iIMPNqYk,5040,7759,a private jet because it's super fast
FR8iIMPNqYk,7759,9840,it's super luxurious and you have to be
FR8iIMPNqYk,9840,12320,super wealthy in order to travel in one
FR8iIMPNqYk,12320,13519,and that's why i'm just going to go off
FR8iIMPNqYk,13519,17920,over there and review a volkswagen polo
FR8iIMPNqYk,18320,19920,i'm just joking they are gonna let me
FR8iIMPNqYk,19920,21359,review this thing and to do that i'm
FR8iIMPNqYk,21359,23119,gonna talk you around the exterior the
FR8iIMPNqYk,23119,24400,interior i'm gonna tell you what's good
FR8iIMPNqYk,24400,26800,about it what's not so good about it yes
FR8iIMPNqYk,26800,28800,even the spaghetti isn't perfect and of
FR8iIMPNqYk,28800,30400,course i'm going to take it for a drive
FR8iIMPNqYk,30400,32238,in fact i'm going to head to the german
FR8iIMPNqYk,32238,34399,autobahn because i want to see exactly
FR8iIMPNqYk,34399,36000,how fast i can drive this thing on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,36000,37440,public road yeah i'm even going to
FR8iIMPNqYk,37440,38559,launch it to see how quick it is from
FR8iIMPNqYk,38559,40559,north to 60 miles an hour anyway i'm
FR8iIMPNqYk,40559,42399,matt watson and you're watching car wow
FR8iIMPNqYk,42399,43760,oh and if you haven't done so already
FR8iIMPNqYk,43760,45360,make sure you subscribe to this channel
FR8iIMPNqYk,45360,46480,because we're going to be doing more
FR8iIMPNqYk,46480,48480,cars like this in future and you don't
FR8iIMPNqYk,48480,50640,want to miss out buying a new car then
FR8iIMPNqYk,50640,52239,head to car wow and my team will help
FR8iIMPNqYk,52239,54559,you find your next car at a fair price
FR8iIMPNqYk,54559,56480,car wow your one-stop car buying
FR8iIMPNqYk,56480,58640,comparison sites let's start this review
FR8iIMPNqYk,58640,60640,by talking about the design of the new
FR8iIMPNqYk,60640,62879,shiron super sport so i don't even tell
FR8iIMPNqYk,62879,64320,already it's slightly longer than the
FR8iIMPNqYk,64320,66560,standard car for improved aerodynamics
FR8iIMPNqYk,66560,68159,for instance it's allowed them to
FR8iIMPNqYk,68159,69920,increase the tear-off area which is the
FR8iIMPNqYk,69920,71040,distance between this part of the car
FR8iIMPNqYk,71040,73200,and this part of the car by 44
FR8iIMPNqYk,73200,74960,and the distance between these two parts
FR8iIMPNqYk,74960,76320,affect the amount of drag so this car
FR8iIMPNqYk,76320,78560,has less drag than the standard chiron
FR8iIMPNqYk,78560,80720,also it's got a bigger rear diffuser for
FR8iIMPNqYk,80720,82240,more downforce and because of that
FR8iIMPNqYk,82240,84000,bigger rear diffuser they've had to put
FR8iIMPNqYk,84000,86159,the exhaust pipes vertically
FR8iIMPNqYk,86159,87759,rather than horizontally let me just
FR8iIMPNqYk,87759,89280,check something though i've got my rimac
FR8iIMPNqYk,89280,91040,sticker truth here
FR8iIMPNqYk,91040,93759,yes that's all real yeah it's all real
FR8iIMPNqYk,93759,95600,anyway let's move down the side of the
FR8iIMPNqYk,95600,97439,car so as with the normal chiron you
FR8iIMPNqYk,97439,99040,have 21 inch alloys at the back as
FR8iIMPNqYk,99040,100960,standard and 20s at the front though the
FR8iIMPNqYk,100960,103280,supersport has its own unique design of
FR8iIMPNqYk,103280,105200,alloy wheel you also get chiron
FR8iIMPNqYk,105200,106960,supersport here on the fuel filler cap
FR8iIMPNqYk,106960,108640,something you'll be seeing a lot of no
FR8iIMPNqYk,108640,110399,doubt if you have this car another
FR8iIMPNqYk,110399,112240,feature is this the super sport gets
FR8iIMPNqYk,112240,114000,these special air vents here in fact
FR8iIMPNqYk,114000,116479,there's nine holes here in the wing on
FR8iIMPNqYk,116479,119439,each side just like on the eb-110 super
FR8iIMPNqYk,119439,121360,sport and let me just check those yes
FR8iIMPNqYk,121360,122240,yes
FR8iIMPNqYk,122240,124640,yes look at all that yeah vouched by the
FR8iIMPNqYk,124640,127119,rimac stick of truth yet again now here
FR8iIMPNqYk,127119,128720,at the front you've got bigger air
FR8iIMPNqYk,128720,131039,curtains as well bigger air intakes and
FR8iIMPNqYk,131039,133200,a larger front splitter for more
FR8iIMPNqYk,133200,134800,downforce here at the front as well and
FR8iIMPNqYk,134800,137280,as a result it all looks a little bit
FR8iIMPNqYk,137280,139360,meaner especially in this black sort of
FR8iIMPNqYk,139360,141599,looks like the batmobile though if you
FR8iIMPNqYk,141599,143440,don't fancy this color i've got another
FR8iIMPNqYk,143440,145040,color over there what do you think of
FR8iIMPNqYk,145040,146319,this orange and black color scheme
FR8iIMPNqYk,146319,147920,certainly stands out doesn't it and
FR8iIMPNqYk,147920,149200,maybe that's what you want when you're
FR8iIMPNqYk,149200,152720,paying three million euros plus taxes
FR8iIMPNqYk,152720,154480,for a shiron super sport it's got
FR8iIMPNqYk,154480,156319,matching interior glass roots it's kind
FR8iIMPNqYk,156319,158800,of cool though it does sort of look like
FR8iIMPNqYk,158800,161680,a japanese giant hornet doesn't it but
FR8iIMPNqYk,161680,163760,then this car does have a sting in its
FR8iIMPNqYk,163760,165360,tail
FR8iIMPNqYk,165360,166959,now let's talk about the engine and here
FR8iIMPNqYk,166959,168720,it is what we've got here is an eight
FR8iIMPNqYk,168720,171920,liter quad turbo w16 it's absolutely
FR8iIMPNqYk,171920,174560,massive and it puts out 1600 horsepower
FR8iIMPNqYk,174560,176560,depending on which version of the car
FR8iIMPNqYk,176560,178159,you have obviously this bit here this is
FR8iIMPNqYk,178159,179920,the gearbox off the front and it
FR8iIMPNqYk,179920,181360,actually sends the power to the front
FR8iIMPNqYk,181360,182640,axle where you've got a limited slip
FR8iIMPNqYk,182640,184640,differential it's a seven speed dual
FR8iIMPNqYk,184640,187040,clutch gearbox it's also got obviously
FR8iIMPNqYk,187040,188959,the power going from here to the rear
FR8iIMPNqYk,188959,190080,once again you've got another
FR8iIMPNqYk,190080,191920,electronically controlled limited slip
FR8iIMPNqYk,191920,193280,differential there now i want to show
FR8iIMPNqYk,193280,196239,you this look this valve here so that
FR8iIMPNqYk,196239,198879,is for the turbos so when you're uh
FR8iIMPNqYk,198879,201280,lower rpm you only actually have one
FR8iIMPNqYk,201280,203360,turbo on each bank operating and that's
FR8iIMPNqYk,203360,205360,to reduce turbo lag and that's why you
FR8iIMPNqYk,205360,208319,get maximum torque of 1600 newton meters
FR8iIMPNqYk,208319,210640,from just 2000 rpm but when you rev the
FR8iIMPNqYk,210640,213840,engine past 4000 rpm this valve opens
FR8iIMPNqYk,213840,217480,and all four turbos start blowing and uh
FR8iIMPNqYk,217480,220879,6700 rpm this thing is sucking in a
FR8iIMPNqYk,220879,223680,thousand liters of air a second in order
FR8iIMPNqYk,223680,225680,for combustion to take place it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,225680,227120,absolutely
FR8iIMPNqYk,227120,228959,nuts you have the same carbon stomach
FR8iIMPNqYk,228959,230640,brakes as on the standard chiron so
FR8iIMPNqYk,230640,232879,you've got 420 millimeter discs up front
FR8iIMPNqYk,232879,234879,400 at the back you've got eight piston
FR8iIMPNqYk,234879,237680,calipers and four pads at the front and
FR8iIMPNqYk,237680,240000,six piston calipers with two pads at the
FR8iIMPNqYk,240000,241439,back should give some pretty good
FR8iIMPNqYk,241439,243280,stopping power but let's find out by
FR8iIMPNqYk,243280,244879,doing a brake test i'm going to do full
FR8iIMPNqYk,244879,247040,emergency stops from 60 miles an hour
FR8iIMPNqYk,247040,248480,see how long it takes this car to stop
FR8iIMPNqYk,248480,251760,so let's see braking now
FR8iIMPNqYk,251920,255519,oh full stompage right
FR8iIMPNqYk,255519,258799,so stopped in 33 meters do you want to
FR8iIMPNqYk,258799,260479,see a car that can also do 33 meters
FR8iIMPNqYk,260479,262000,click on the pop-up banner up there to
FR8iIMPNqYk,262000,264240,go check out what car that is
FR8iIMPNqYk,264240,266000,when you're braking from higher speeds
FR8iIMPNqYk,266000,268240,then you also get some help from the air
FR8iIMPNqYk,268240,270720,brake so it'll deploy from 180
FR8iIMPNqYk,270720,272960,kilometers an hour and when you are
FR8iIMPNqYk,272960,274880,braking the combined effect of the
FR8iIMPNqYk,274880,277120,normal friction brakes and the air brake
FR8iIMPNqYk,277120,279360,from a speed of 380 kilometers an hour
FR8iIMPNqYk,279360,282400,you get two g's of deceleration now
FR8iIMPNqYk,282400,284320,let's talk about the car chassis so it
FR8iIMPNqYk,284320,286160,has a common fiber tub which is so stiff
FR8iIMPNqYk,286160,289360,its torsional rigidity is 50 000 newton
FR8iIMPNqYk,289360,291840,meters per degree what that means is
FR8iIMPNqYk,291840,293040,that you can bolt the back of the
FR8iIMPNqYk,293040,295600,chassis onto the wall get a metal bar a
FR8iIMPNqYk,295600,298000,very strong one attach it to the front
FR8iIMPNqYk,298000,300400,so it's meet along the metal bar and you
FR8iIMPNqYk,300400,301759,could put down
FR8iIMPNqYk,301759,304800,50 tons worth of pressure on that bar
FR8iIMPNqYk,304800,307120,and the chassis would only twist
FR8iIMPNqYk,307120,309840,by one degree it's insane as with the
FR8iIMPNqYk,309840,311600,normal sheer on this super sport has
FR8iIMPNqYk,311600,314479,double wishbone suspension all round
FR8iIMPNqYk,314479,316720,however they have tweaked the suspension
FR8iIMPNqYk,316720,318240,ever so slightly so while you have
FR8iIMPNqYk,318240,320720,similar springs the dampers have been
FR8iIMPNqYk,320720,322400,retuned to cope with the cars slightly
FR8iIMPNqYk,322400,324720,higher top speed welcome to the inside
FR8iIMPNqYk,324720,326639,of the bugatti chiron super sport now
FR8iIMPNqYk,326639,328000,the only changes over the standard car
FR8iIMPNqYk,328000,330080,really are shown super sport written
FR8iIMPNqYk,330080,332320,there into the headrest and here on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,332320,334080,knee pads as well other than that it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,334080,336320,just like a normal chiron if there is
FR8iIMPNqYk,336320,338240,such a thing as a normal shear on and
FR8iIMPNqYk,338240,340160,this is a really bespoke car and it's so
FR8iIMPNqYk,340160,342320,exquisite here on the inside i like the
FR8iIMPNqYk,342320,344560,actual trim on this one so we've got
FR8iIMPNqYk,344560,345600,leather here on the steering wheel but
FR8iIMPNqYk,345600,347360,then it's carbon fiber and all the metal
FR8iIMPNqYk,347360,349919,bits just feel super expensive you got
FR8iIMPNqYk,349919,351440,your engine start button there you
FR8iIMPNqYk,351440,353280,launch control button there i will be
FR8iIMPNqYk,353280,354960,launching the car later on the video you
FR8iIMPNqYk,354960,356800,betcha also you've got the driving mode
FR8iIMPNqYk,356800,358560,switch there in front of you you've got
FR8iIMPNqYk,358560,361039,a big speedo which goes all the way to
FR8iIMPNqYk,361039,363600,500 kilometers an hour
FR8iIMPNqYk,363600,365039,and there's a digital rep count on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,365039,366880,left and an infotainment screen on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,366880,368400,right which has your sat nav and various
FR8iIMPNqYk,368400,370160,other bits and pieces as well one thing
FR8iIMPNqYk,370160,372880,to note is this though look
FR8iIMPNqYk,372880,375440,manually operated steering column
FR8iIMPNqYk,375440,378240,in a three million euro car hmm not so
FR8iIMPNqYk,378240,379759,sure about that well i'm sure about
FR8iIMPNqYk,379759,381440,though is a seating position it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,381440,383360,absolutely brilliant and the seats are
FR8iIMPNqYk,383360,384560,glorious and of course they're
FR8iIMPNqYk,384560,386560,electrically operated also what's
FR8iIMPNqYk,386560,388880,glorious is this bit here see this this
FR8iIMPNqYk,388880,391440,sort of c it matches the c shape on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,391440,392880,air intakes on the side in fact
FR8iIMPNqYk,392880,394400,everything about this car is exquisite
FR8iIMPNqYk,394400,397680,it's just wonderful i like these little
FR8iIMPNqYk,397680,399680,switches here there for your climate
FR8iIMPNqYk,399680,402160,control but if you press a button you
FR8iIMPNqYk,402160,403919,can get some information on them such as
FR8iIMPNqYk,403919,405520,the maximum horsepower you've had at the
FR8iIMPNqYk,405520,407759,engine so this one has gone all the way
FR8iIMPNqYk,407759,410720,up to 1 615 horsepower and lock it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,410720,412639,revved to be on 7000 rpm it's also
FR8iIMPNqYk,412639,413919,showing the maximum speed this car's
FR8iIMPNqYk,413919,416479,done it's only say 113 miles an hour but
FR8iIMPNqYk,416479,417919,i'm going to go on the autobahn and i
FR8iIMPNqYk,417919,419199,reckon i'm going to easily beat that and
FR8iIMPNqYk,419199,420800,we'll find out exactly how fast i go a
FR8iIMPNqYk,420800,423039,bit later on in this video other things
FR8iIMPNqYk,423039,425280,to mention are the pedals are lovely
FR8iIMPNqYk,425280,427360,expensive aluminium feeling pedals and
FR8iIMPNqYk,427360,429120,while the carpets aren't deep like in a
FR8iIMPNqYk,429120,431440,rolls royce they do feel expensive there
FR8iIMPNqYk,431440,432960,is a bit of practicality in here we've
FR8iIMPNqYk,432960,434720,got some storage area hairs decent sized
FR8iIMPNqYk,434720,437280,door bin and like a glove box of
FR8iIMPNqYk,437280,440000,mediocre capacity but what about if you
FR8iIMPNqYk,440000,442639,need to carry some proper luggage
FR8iIMPNqYk,442639,444560,being a car wire video we need to assess
FR8iIMPNqYk,444560,446720,this car's practicality it is important
FR8iIMPNqYk,446720,449440,you know so this
FR8iIMPNqYk,449440,451120,is the entirety
FR8iIMPNqYk,451120,453520,of your luggage space
FR8iIMPNqYk,453520,456400,that now you can get bespoke shoe on
FR8iIMPNqYk,456400,458160,luggage look with the blue to match your
FR8iIMPNqYk,458160,461120,car if you want which fits perfectly
FR8iIMPNqYk,461120,462000,but
FR8iIMPNqYk,462000,463680,that's a lot so if you want to go for a
FR8iIMPNqYk,463680,465680,trip across a continent you're probably
FR8iIMPNqYk,465680,467599,going to have to get some of your staff
FR8iIMPNqYk,467599,469360,to come along in a support car that
FR8iIMPNqYk,469360,471199,brings up the five and nine things about
FR8iIMPNqYk,471199,472560,the chiron
FR8iIMPNqYk,472560,474160,you can't go anywhere in this car
FR8iIMPNqYk,474160,477520,without people taking photos of it
FR8iIMPNqYk,477520,478960,yeah it's okay don't worry do you take
FR8iIMPNqYk,478960,480319,your photos
FR8iIMPNqYk,480319,482479,yes or the attention does get a little
FR8iIMPNqYk,482479,485680,bit tiresome after a while darling
FR8iIMPNqYk,485680,487840,when you're driving along the big wheels
FR8iIMPNqYk,487840,489199,actually flick up stones and there's
FR8iIMPNqYk,489199,490560,some vents there to relieve pressure
FR8iIMPNqYk,490560,491599,from the wheel arches but they also
FR8iIMPNqYk,491599,492639,allowed the stones to get flicked up
FR8iIMPNqYk,492639,494240,here then they end up just gathering
FR8iIMPNqYk,494240,495120,here
FR8iIMPNqYk,495120,497280,on the side skirt right
FR8iIMPNqYk,497280,499680,you have to get on his stuff to remove
FR8iIMPNqYk,499680,501039,them
FR8iIMPNqYk,501039,503440,there are no dedicated cup holders in
FR8iIMPNqYk,503440,505360,the chiron at all what you've got is
FR8iIMPNqYk,505360,507599,this slightly recessed area there but
FR8iIMPNqYk,507599,508960,when you accelerate i think your tea is
FR8iIMPNqYk,508960,510960,going to go everywhere isn't it
FR8iIMPNqYk,510960,512159,if you just suddenly come into some
FR8iIMPNqYk,512159,514080,money and you think i'm gonna get myself
FR8iIMPNqYk,514080,516560,a bugatti super sport awesome i'm gonna
FR8iIMPNqYk,516560,518000,have it in the color of the world
FR8iIMPNqYk,518000,520000,record-breaking car that wonderful black
FR8iIMPNqYk,520000,523680,and orange bad luck only the super sport
FR8iIMPNqYk,523680,526800,300 plus has that color scheme not the
FR8iIMPNqYk,526800,529680,normal super sport and there are only 30
FR8iIMPNqYk,529680,532080,supersport 300 plus is made and they're
FR8iIMPNqYk,532080,533920,all sold so you can't have that colour
FR8iIMPNqYk,533920,536160,scheme i'm afraid unless you get it
FR8iIMPNqYk,536160,538000,spray painted yourself or maybe wrapped
FR8iIMPNqYk,538000,539760,by someone like yanny
FR8iIMPNqYk,539760,541920,the chiron doesn't have surround view
FR8iIMPNqYk,541920,543519,cameras as standard instead you just get
FR8iIMPNqYk,543519,545600,this single reversing camera and the
FR8iIMPNqYk,545600,547040,screen is actually quite small so you
FR8iIMPNqYk,547040,548880,can't see very clearly where you're
FR8iIMPNqYk,548880,551279,reversing exactly that's a real pain on
FR8iIMPNqYk,551279,554240,something as wide as this
FR8iIMPNqYk,554240,555839,thankfully this car has plenty of cool
FR8iIMPNqYk,555839,557440,features to help make up for all this
FR8iIMPNqYk,557440,558800,here's five
FR8iIMPNqYk,558800,560399,if you're buying a bugatti you can come
FR8iIMPNqYk,560399,563360,here to the factory in multi and spec
FR8iIMPNqYk,563360,565440,your car in the design center
FR8iIMPNqYk,565440,567200,so customers will
FR8iIMPNqYk,567200,568320,come
FR8iIMPNqYk,568320,570480,through this door
FR8iIMPNqYk,570480,571839,they won't shut it they'll have stuff to
FR8iIMPNqYk,571839,573360,shut it after them
FR8iIMPNqYk,573360,574959,and to make sure that they don't expect
FR8iIMPNqYk,574959,576080,their kind of way that it looks a little
FR8iIMPNqYk,576080,577600,bit
FR8iIMPNqYk,577600,579680,you actually have one of the guys who
FR8iIMPNqYk,579680,581120,works for bugatti as a designer
FR8iIMPNqYk,581120,583120,designing the cars yeah he sits behind
FR8iIMPNqYk,583120,585200,there and he'll help you configure your
FR8iIMPNqYk,585200,587680,car so it looks good okay then you can
FR8iIMPNqYk,587680,588839,come through
FR8iIMPNqYk,588839,591920,here and look at all the different
FR8iIMPNqYk,591920,593440,elements to do the car you can have a
FR8iIMPNqYk,593440,595279,look at the different paint options
FR8iIMPNqYk,595279,597519,we've got the swatches just over here so
FR8iIMPNqYk,597519,600080,you can choose your ideal
FR8iIMPNqYk,600080,602320,exterior paint do you want exposed
FR8iIMPNqYk,602320,604399,carbon or do you like a nice flat blue
FR8iIMPNqYk,604399,606160,it's up to you and then while you're
FR8iIMPNqYk,606160,607920,here you may as well get yourself some
FR8iIMPNqYk,607920,609519,extra bugatti bits and pieces such as
FR8iIMPNqYk,609519,612000,these speakers for your house
FR8iIMPNqYk,612000,615519,these are 300 000 pounds
FR8iIMPNqYk,615519,616839,yes
FR8iIMPNqYk,616839,619440,that's the super sport gets an upgraded
FR8iIMPNqYk,619440,621360,exhaust over the standard chiron which
FR8iIMPNqYk,621360,623839,apparently sounds fruitier so shall we
FR8iIMPNqYk,623839,627920,find out for ourselves go on start it up
FR8iIMPNqYk,628320,629120,oh
FR8iIMPNqYk,629120,630839,god rave
FR8iIMPNqYk,630839,634240,it oh
FR8iIMPNqYk,634720,635920,there's a lot of heat coming out of
FR8iIMPNqYk,635920,637839,there remember some more i'm getting
FR8iIMPNqYk,637839,640880,high oh
FR8iIMPNqYk,641760,643920,it's actually quite nice that is
FR8iIMPNqYk,643920,645760,it sounds pretty fruity shane there's a
FR8iIMPNqYk,645760,647920,bit of a soft limiter on it but still it
FR8iIMPNqYk,647920,649760,sounds better than a rim at nivera even
FR8iIMPNqYk,649760,651839,though the navera might be a bit quicker
FR8iIMPNqYk,651839,653839,so yeah matty remember your car doesn't
FR8iIMPNqYk,653839,655680,sound as good as the bugatti
FR8iIMPNqYk,655680,657120,now wait a minute the bugatti is now
FR8iIMPNqYk,657120,659360,also your car isn't it
FR8iIMPNqYk,659360,660480,oh well
FR8iIMPNqYk,660480,662800,the car will alter its ride height and
FR8iIMPNqYk,662800,664560,angle of attack depending on what mode
FR8iIMPNqYk,664560,666399,you've got in so if you put it into auto
FR8iIMPNqYk,666399,668720,bar mode sort of goes a bit lower and
FR8iIMPNqYk,668720,670560,more steeply rate for improved high
FR8iIMPNqYk,670560,671839,speed stability and then if you're
FR8iIMPNqYk,671839,673040,driving around town or worried about
FR8iIMPNqYk,673040,675279,speed humps you can actually lift it so
FR8iIMPNqYk,675279,676720,that you can make it over them without
FR8iIMPNqYk,676720,678640,grounding out and damaging your carbon
FR8iIMPNqYk,678640,681040,fiber front splitter the supersport has
FR8iIMPNqYk,681040,682880,some special michelin pilot sport cup
FR8iIMPNqYk,682880,684959,two tyres specifically designed for the
FR8iIMPNqYk,684959,686079,car and you can tell they're the
FR8iIMPNqYk,686079,688000,official tires because they have bg
FR8iIMPNqYk,688000,690079,written on them personally i prefer a bj
FR8iIMPNqYk,690079,691839,but there we go now these tires are
FR8iIMPNqYk,691839,694880,capable are sustained 500 kilometers an
FR8iIMPNqYk,694880,697120,hour which is 313 miles an hour and
FR8iIMPNqYk,697120,699440,they're not cheap for a set of these
FR8iIMPNqYk,699440,701040,10 000 pounds
FR8iIMPNqYk,701040,703279,with the shear on you get two keys
FR8iIMPNqYk,703279,705120,there's the normal ignition key to start
FR8iIMPNqYk,705120,708240,the car and then there's the special
FR8iIMPNqYk,708240,709519,speed key
FR8iIMPNqYk,709519,711760,now
FR8iIMPNqYk,711760,713279,if you come to a standstill and you turn
FR8iIMPNqYk,713279,716320,this it unleashes the full potential of
FR8iIMPNqYk,716320,718399,the car so just on the normal key it
FR8iIMPNqYk,718399,721519,will do 236 miles an hour with a speed
FR8iIMPNqYk,721519,722320,key
FR8iIMPNqYk,722320,724720,you can go all the way up to 273 miles
FR8iIMPNqYk,724720,725920,an hour now you might be thinking wait a
FR8iIMPNqYk,725920,728399,minute matt uh the supersport 300 you
FR8iIMPNqYk,728399,730399,know it's called that because
FR8iIMPNqYk,730399,731920,it can do over 300 miles an hour and it
FR8iIMPNqYk,731920,734079,did it was clocked at 304 miles an hour
FR8iIMPNqYk,734079,736480,and this car is capable of 304 miles an
FR8iIMPNqYk,736480,738560,hour however in order to do that you
FR8iIMPNqYk,738560,741120,need everything to be perfect conditions
FR8iIMPNqYk,741120,744079,totally perfect and so bugatti actually
FR8iIMPNqYk,744079,745360,limit the speed of all the cars that
FR8iIMPNqYk,745360,747519,they sell to customers just for a margin
FR8iIMPNqYk,747519,749680,of safety because if conditions aren't
FR8iIMPNqYk,749680,751200,entirely perfect
FR8iIMPNqYk,751200,753680,things go wrong you don't want that not
FR8iIMPNqYk,753680,755600,at 304 miles an hour
FR8iIMPNqYk,755600,757200,it's finally time to see what this
FR8iIMPNqYk,757200,759680,chiron is like to drive is actually
FR8iIMPNqYk,759680,761600,really really easy to live with as a
FR8iIMPNqYk,761600,762560,daily so i'm just going to go into
FR8iIMPNqYk,762560,764800,normal drive mode and let the gearbox do
FR8iIMPNqYk,764800,766000,its thing and i'm just going to pootle
FR8iIMPNqYk,766000,768720,about and i could just be in a normal
FR8iIMPNqYk,768720,770800,car my mom could drive this no problem
FR8iIMPNqYk,770800,772320,at all it's just so easy to drive
FR8iIMPNqYk,772320,774320,especially for a car that is capable of
FR8iIMPNqYk,774320,776480,such insane speed yet the weight goes
FR8iIMPNqYk,776480,779040,over bumps is just pretty much like a
FR8iIMPNqYk,779040,781120,hatchback that's not true actually it
FR8iIMPNqYk,781120,783120,feels more sophisticated the way it
FR8iIMPNqYk,783120,784720,deals with bumps than a hatchback
FR8iIMPNqYk,784720,786160,because its suspension is more
FR8iIMPNqYk,786160,788399,sophisticated visibility forward is
FR8iIMPNqYk,788399,789519,extremely good because you've got a
FR8iIMPNqYk,789519,791120,relatively low dash it's all right at
FR8iIMPNqYk,791120,792480,the side and this view out the back
FR8iIMPNqYk,792480,794399,although it is obscured slightly by what
FR8iIMPNqYk,794399,797600,looks like a sperm whale's tail
FR8iIMPNqYk,797600,799519,a huge huge wick
FR8iIMPNqYk,799519,801200,it's so easy to drive i can't get my
FR8iIMPNqYk,801200,802639,head around it but then if you want you
FR8iIMPNqYk,802639,806240,can just take control of things and
FR8iIMPNqYk,808560,810560,yeah put your foot down and did it hear
FR8iIMPNqYk,810560,812560,that wait for a second for the boost to
FR8iIMPNqYk,812560,813920,build but then it comes on and it comes
FR8iIMPNqYk,813920,816079,on strong and then this car just takes
FR8iIMPNqYk,816079,817440,off and then when you lift off for a
FR8iIMPNqYk,817440,819360,corner
FR8iIMPNqYk,819360,822240,you just hear the gas and go
FR8iIMPNqYk,822240,824959,so good and in a corner considering it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,824959,826800,a relatively heavy car
FR8iIMPNqYk,826800,829120,it's so planted it's incredible and of
FR8iIMPNqYk,829120,830399,course you've got four wheel drive
FR8iIMPNqYk,830399,832639,traction to just whoa
FR8iIMPNqYk,832639,835279,just to haul you out the beds it's nuts
FR8iIMPNqYk,835279,836959,oh that's so addictive getting this
FR8iIMPNqYk,836959,839839,thing on boost and flooring it
FR8iIMPNqYk,839839,841040,and then you look down at what gear
FR8iIMPNqYk,841040,843680,you're in and it pulls as they're in a
FR8iIMPNqYk,843680,845680,much lower gear than you actually are
FR8iIMPNqYk,845680,849920,the torque from this engine is nuts
FR8iIMPNqYk,851120,852320,so good
FR8iIMPNqYk,852320,853440,oh
FR8iIMPNqYk,853440,854720,yeah if you want to overtake people it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,854720,857839,just like
FR8iIMPNqYk,858959,860399,i'm going to put it into auto mode and
FR8iIMPNqYk,860399,861600,see what it's just like when you want to
FR8iIMPNqYk,861600,863440,calm down again and chill
FR8iIMPNqYk,863440,864880,obviously being a dual clutch it's not
FR8iIMPNqYk,864880,866959,quite as silky smooth at changing gears
FR8iIMPNqYk,866959,869440,as one with a torque converter but then
FR8iIMPNqYk,869440,870800,when you're on it and you want to change
FR8iIMPNqYk,870800,872399,gears yourself it's like smack smack
FR8iIMPNqYk,872399,874639,smack through the gear box
FR8iIMPNqYk,874639,876160,all right i think i'll turn around but
FR8iIMPNqYk,876160,877600,be careful
FR8iIMPNqYk,877600,880160,because it's a very expensive car
FR8iIMPNqYk,880160,881440,um
FR8iIMPNqYk,881440,884880,so i think i might turn around here
FR8iIMPNqYk,884880,887199,reverses down there right
FR8iIMPNqYk,887199,889519,oh got a little camera there showing me
FR8iIMPNqYk,889519,892800,what's behind me sort of
FR8iIMPNqYk,894000,895680,it's not as difficult as he might
FR8iIMPNqYk,895680,898000,imagine in something so powerful do you
FR8iIMPNqYk,898000,899120,know what every time i drive this car i
FR8iIMPNqYk,899120,900320,keep forgetting that you have to knock
FR8iIMPNqYk,900320,902000,it twice again to drive otherwise you
FR8iIMPNqYk,902000,903199,just sit there neutral looking like a
FR8iIMPNqYk,903199,907040,complete another idiot just revving away
FR8iIMPNqYk,907040,908000,do you know what they've done in this
FR8iIMPNqYk,908000,910720,car very very important this
FR8iIMPNqYk,910720,913040,especially for a hyper car
FR8iIMPNqYk,913040,914320,the position
FR8iIMPNqYk,914320,916079,of the central tunnel the height of it
FR8iIMPNqYk,916079,917839,and the armrest hit it's perfect for
FR8iIMPNqYk,917839,920320,just driving along like this
FR8iIMPNqYk,920320,922399,maybe you shouldn't drive a car this
FR8iIMPNqYk,922399,923839,powerful just
FR8iIMPNqYk,923839,925600,like that but you can do
FR8iIMPNqYk,925600,927920,or grip it properly
FR8iIMPNqYk,927920,930639,take control
FR8iIMPNqYk,932160,933839,do you know what's super impressive it's
FR8iIMPNqYk,933839,935519,the actual feel you get through the
FR8iIMPNqYk,935519,939360,controls it really is just so well set
FR8iIMPNqYk,939360,941680,up it's totally like tuned into your
FR8iIMPNqYk,941680,943600,brain like the amount of steering input
FR8iIMPNqYk,943600,944880,is the amount of response you get from
FR8iIMPNqYk,944880,946560,the car what you expect to get the brake
FR8iIMPNqYk,946560,948399,pedal feel is so good you can just judge
FR8iIMPNqYk,948399,951360,the braking so it's not at all
FR8iIMPNqYk,951360,953360,jerky you can make it really smooth and
FR8iIMPNqYk,953360,954959,then if you want to really stop hard it
FR8iIMPNqYk,954959,957680,will do it's nicely set up it makes the
FR8iIMPNqYk,957680,959920,classy feel a lot lighter than it really
FR8iIMPNqYk,959920,960800,is
FR8iIMPNqYk,960800,962079,and you might not think that from
FR8iIMPNqYk,962079,963600,something that's capable of these kind
FR8iIMPNqYk,963600,964720,of speed do you think it'd just be a
FR8iIMPNqYk,964720,968079,one-trick pony but it's not
FR8iIMPNqYk,968079,970800,it's more of a multi-faceted
FR8iIMPNqYk,970800,972399,horse
FR8iIMPNqYk,972399,973680,that's a weird analogy that no one's
FR8iIMPNqYk,973680,975440,ever used before and will
FR8iIMPNqYk,975440,977279,probably never be used again
FR8iIMPNqYk,977279,980480,it makes a noise like a horse
FR8iIMPNqYk,981440,983839,sorry about that do you know what though
FR8iIMPNqYk,983839,986399,this thing is about top speed isn't it
FR8iIMPNqYk,986399,988480,i need to go somewhere where i can open
FR8iIMPNqYk,988480,991680,this thing up so i think it's time to
FR8iIMPNqYk,991680,993600,head to germany
FR8iIMPNqYk,993600,995279,in the autobahn
FR8iIMPNqYk,995279,996720,before we head on to the autobahn it
FR8iIMPNqYk,996720,999600,makes sense for me to fill this thing up
FR8iIMPNqYk,999600,1001920,to the brim with petrol because when
FR8iIMPNqYk,1001920,1003839,you're maxing out it just drinks fuel at
FR8iIMPNqYk,1003839,1006880,an alarming rate so here we go
FR8iIMPNqYk,1006880,1010639,oh no don't put 95 in my car
FR8iIMPNqYk,1010639,1012240,we'll only have 1200 horsepower instead

FR8iIMPNqYk,1160240,1161840,gets through his petrol pretty quickly
FR8iIMPNqYk,1161840,1163440,when you're doing that though
FR8iIMPNqYk,1163440,1165440,you can actually see the gauge move you
FR8iIMPNqYk,1165440,1166640,know what i'm cruising along i'm going
FR8iIMPNqYk,1166640,1168320,to give you a bit of useful consumer
FR8iIMPNqYk,1168320,1170720,advice about this car so i have noticed
FR8iIMPNqYk,1170720,1173120,that when you're cruising along got 150
FR8iIMPNqYk,1173120,1175120,kilometers an hour you get a slight
FR8iIMPNqYk,1175120,1177760,whine from the engine ever so slowly
FR8iIMPNqYk,1177760,1179679,it's not too bad but you do notice it
FR8iIMPNqYk,1179679,1182240,you could find it a bit irritating maybe
FR8iIMPNqYk,1182240,1183760,however when you're going over that
FR8iIMPNqYk,1183760,1185280,speed you don't notice it because you're
FR8iIMPNqYk,1185280,1187200,typically focusing on what's going on so
FR8iIMPNqYk,1187200,1190559,it doesn't really matter anyway
FR8iIMPNqYk,1190559,1193840,let's get on
FR8iIMPNqYk,1207360,1208880,here we go
FR8iIMPNqYk,1208880,1211360,come on
FR8iIMPNqYk,1212000,1215919,wow this thing just hauls us

FR8iIMPNqYk,1229440,1231360,you know what i've been ported twice now
FR8iIMPNqYk,1231360,1233280,by renault right the car's getting low
FR8iIMPNqYk,1233280,1236320,on fuel i'm going to give it one last go
FR8iIMPNqYk,1236320,1238159,i've done 208 miles an hour i want to
FR8iIMPNqYk,1238159,1241679,try and get past 210
FR8iIMPNqYk,1245760,1249400,there's another opportunity
FR8iIMPNqYk,1250420,1252640,[Music]
FR8iIMPNqYk,1252640,1254159,that was some serious speed there what
FR8iIMPNqYk,1254159,1256679,did i do so i just managed to do
FR8iIMPNqYk,1256679,1259919,212 miles an hour i wanted to get over
FR8iIMPNqYk,1259919,1262720,200 then i did 280 and i wanted to get
FR8iIMPNqYk,1262720,1265480,over 210 and i did it
FR8iIMPNqYk,1265480,1269200,212 miles an hour in
FR8iIMPNqYk,1269200,1270480,the chiron
FR8iIMPNqYk,1270480,1273760,super sport i can relax now oh no no
FR8iIMPNqYk,1273760,1275600,there is one last thing
FR8iIMPNqYk,1275600,1278480,to do obviously bugatti says the shield
FR8iIMPNqYk,1278480,1280240,on super sport will do not 60 miles an
FR8iIMPNqYk,1280240,1282640,hour in 2.4 seconds
FR8iIMPNqYk,1282640,1285120,but i don't believe them i don't at all
FR8iIMPNqYk,1285120,1287120,so i think it's only fair that i test it
FR8iIMPNqYk,1287120,1288480,for myself so i'm going to do that with
FR8iIMPNqYk,1288480,1291200,my specialist timing gear up here so
FR8iIMPNqYk,1291200,1292480,lift on the brake
FR8iIMPNqYk,1292480,1294799,very hard press launch control
FR8iIMPNqYk,1294799,1297440,for the throttle
FR8iIMPNqYk,1298400,1300960,little boost
FR8iIMPNqYk,1301520,1305440,off we go the entire been there
FR8iIMPNqYk,1305440,1307760,okay they're right bunch of liars
FR8iIMPNqYk,1307760,1309120,contrast material look he doesn't know
FR8iIMPNqYk,1309120,1312799,16 2.3 seconds terrible
FR8iIMPNqYk,1312799,1314480,that was nuts
FR8iIMPNqYk,1314480,1316799,that was literally nuts
FR8iIMPNqYk,1316799,1318240,i can't believe it does it how it all
FR8iIMPNqYk,1318240,1319840,just works together the gearbox the
FR8iIMPNqYk,1319840,1321679,engine everything and it goes and does
FR8iIMPNqYk,1321679,1323679,that the poor tyres though i do feel
FR8iIMPNqYk,1323679,1325360,sorry for the tires but they they did
FR8iIMPNqYk,1325360,1328520,their job
FR8iIMPNqYk,1332320,1334640,so then what's my final verdict on the
FR8iIMPNqYk,1334640,1337520,bugatti cheer on supersport should you
FR8iIMPNqYk,1337520,1339120,avoid it should you consider it should
FR8iIMPNqYk,1339120,1341039,you shortlist it or should you just go
