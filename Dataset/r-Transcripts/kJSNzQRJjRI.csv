kJSNzQRJjRI,19359,20960,of embers but i'm still not sure what
kJSNzQRJjRI,20960,22400,it's gonna look like because there's a
kJSNzQRJjRI,22400,24240,lot of dirt in here too does this method
kJSNzQRJjRI,24240,25599,actually work is this cooked because
kJSNzQRJjRI,25599,27279,sometimes it can look not cooked but

kJSNzQRJjRI,121439,122719,like a carrot that's been soaking in
kJSNzQRJjRI,122719,123920,sugar for three days i've never had
kJSNzQRJjRI,123920,125520,anything like that from sweet pickles to
kJSNzQRJjRI,125520,127119,the real pickle mango pickles i didn't
kJSNzQRJjRI,127119,129039,know you could picklize a mango in this

kJSNzQRJjRI,130560,132720,famous form of the pickles
kJSNzQRJjRI,132720,135120,oh very sour super salty it's like a
kJSNzQRJjRI,135120,137280,green olive times a million but i like
kJSNzQRJjRI,137280,138560,it
kJSNzQRJjRI,138560,140319,here these are parathas but these are
kJSNzQRJjRI,140319,142560,not your ordinary parathas because they
kJSNzQRJjRI,142560,144879,have different stuffings going on
kJSNzQRJjRI,144879,147200,paratha is a flat bread made from layers
kJSNzQRJjRI,147200,149200,of dough with delicious stuffings inside
kJSNzQRJjRI,149200,151200,like spiced potatoes
kJSNzQRJjRI,151200,153760,it starts with the dough flour salt oil
kJSNzQRJjRI,153760,155760,and water fill that with mashed potatoes
kJSNzQRJjRI,155760,158319,coriander green chili pomegranate seeds
kJSNzQRJjRI,158319,160239,salt and red chili powder add butter
kJSNzQRJjRI,160239,162270,then a doughy lid on top
kJSNzQRJjRI,162270,166000,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,166000,167120,it reminds me a little bit of two
kJSNzQRJjRI,167120,168800,chapatis with some stuffing in between
kJSNzQRJjRI,168800,170480,it's super heavy i can taste the potato
kJSNzQRJjRI,170480,172319,inside i love the bready part on the
kJSNzQRJjRI,172319,173680,outside and then it's just a burst of
kJSNzQRJjRI,173680,175920,flavor from the masala super delicious i
kJSNzQRJjRI,175920,176300,love it
kJSNzQRJjRI,176300,178879,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,178879,181120,next up the fenugreek paratha smashed
kJSNzQRJjRI,181120,182879,with the mortar until it becomes a mushy
kJSNzQRJjRI,182879,185760,paste
kJSNzQRJjRI,185760,186800,i'm gonna try a little bit of this one
kJSNzQRJjRI,186800,188800,too
kJSNzQRJjRI,188800,190480,it's super fresh it tastes more grassy
kJSNzQRJjRI,190480,192080,it has a really strong chlorophyll taste
kJSNzQRJjRI,192080,193360,to it that's really good does the butter
kJSNzQRJjRI,193360,194800,go on anything here i use it on
kJSNzQRJjRI,194800,196080,everything on everything that's the
kJSNzQRJjRI,196080,197840,result of the lassi making right exactly
kJSNzQRJjRI,197840,199840,so this is the by-product or for me this
kJSNzQRJjRI,199840,201990,is the product because i love butter
kJSNzQRJjRI,201990,204159,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,204159,205519,as a butter it's so different i think
kJSNzQRJjRI,205519,206959,it's unsalted right so this you're just
kJSNzQRJjRI,206959,208959,tasting really the pure fat but with all
kJSNzQRJjRI,208959,210959,the saltiness oh i love it
kJSNzQRJjRI,210959,212959,to cap off this breakfast we have the
kJSNzQRJjRI,212959,214720,homemade lassi
kJSNzQRJjRI,214720,216480,oh it's so good it tastes exactly like a
kJSNzQRJjRI,216480,218080,sweet yogurt that you can drink super
kJSNzQRJjRI,218080,220000,delicious cold refreshing i love it
kJSNzQRJjRI,220000,221519,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,221519,223040,this is a great way to start the day a
kJSNzQRJjRI,223040,224239,lot of new flavors and a lot of things

kJSNzQRJjRI,227519,228560,a little bit of variety and the
kJSNzQRJjRI,228560,230799,breakfast it's more about dairy products
kJSNzQRJjRI,230799,232560,but as the day goes along things will
kJSNzQRJjRI,232560,234319,start to get meatier so we'll take you

kJSNzQRJjRI,312080,313919,all these little slits scoring it all
kJSNzQRJjRI,313919,315440,over the body right now he's cutting off

kJSNzQRJjRI,319759,322160,oh okay so now they're putting a stick
kJSNzQRJjRI,322160,323440,through that is why he was making the
kJSNzQRJjRI,323440,325039,bum a little bigger the stick goes
kJSNzQRJjRI,325039,326880,through it goes out the other end like
kJSNzQRJjRI,326880,328639,when you eat spicy pakistani food from
kJSNzQRJjRI,328639,331039,here it's time to put the masala inside

kJSNzQRJjRI,332800,334240,now he's putting in the rice the rice
kJSNzQRJjRI,334240,335840,has just been par cooked because it's
kJSNzQRJjRI,335840,337120,going to finish cooking while it's
kJSNzQRJjRI,337120,339280,inside the goat after the goat is fully
kJSNzQRJjRI,339280,341440,stuffed with masala and rice the chef
kJSNzQRJjRI,341440,344000,adds a final fistful of almonds raisins
kJSNzQRJjRI,344000,345600,and walnuts
kJSNzQRJjRI,345600,349600,now he coats the animals from head to
kJSNzQRJjRI,349759,351600,from neck to toe using the remaining
kJSNzQRJjRI,351600,353520,masala
kJSNzQRJjRI,353520,355520,once the stomach is sealed it's ready
kJSNzQRJjRI,355520,356340,for the pit
kJSNzQRJjRI,356340,359470,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,360800,362720,so we have our goat right here gentlemen
kJSNzQRJjRI,362720,364240,please proceed
kJSNzQRJjRI,364240,366319,anytime you're burying an animal to cook
kJSNzQRJjRI,366319,368160,there's always a chance something could
kJSNzQRJjRI,368160,370479,go wrong they've kind of built a groove
kJSNzQRJjRI,370479,372319,into the mud here so as they put it down
kJSNzQRJjRI,372319,374000,the stick fits perfectly into that
kJSNzQRJjRI,374000,375600,groove timing right now i can see
kJSNzQRJjRI,375600,377120,there's a bunch of embers underneath
kJSNzQRJjRI,377120,379199,temperature it's very hot the distance
kJSNzQRJjRI,379199,380960,between the heat and the meat these
kJSNzQRJjRI,380960,382479,grooves are not deep enough so they're
kJSNzQRJjRI,382479,384160,going to dig these even deeper so the
kJSNzQRJjRI,384160,386240,goat can go deeper into the hole it all
kJSNzQRJjRI,386240,387919,must come together perfectly now they're
kJSNzQRJjRI,387919,389680,going to put it in the new more deeply
kJSNzQRJjRI,389680,392080,dug grooves if you're off it's over and
kJSNzQRJjRI,392080,393919,there are no redos they're bringing over
kJSNzQRJjRI,393919,396080,a giant lid it might look like a table
kJSNzQRJjRI,396080,398240,but it's absolutely not a table it's a
kJSNzQRJjRI,398240,399199,lid
kJSNzQRJjRI,399199,400400,i'm trying to figure out how this works
kJSNzQRJjRI,400400,402080,because there is still plenty of space
kJSNzQRJjRI,402080,404479,between the hole and the lid
kJSNzQRJjRI,404479,406880,oh bricks so this is how they seal it
kJSNzQRJjRI,406880,408319,because we want to keep as much heat in
kJSNzQRJjRI,408319,410000,there as possible it's essentially
kJSNzQRJjRI,410000,411759,roasting and steaming at the same time
kJSNzQRJjRI,411759,413199,from here it's just about getting this
kJSNzQRJjRI,413199,414880,kind of sealed so all the heat is going
kJSNzQRJjRI,414880,416319,to stay inside
kJSNzQRJjRI,416319,418720,as the goat is sealed so is the fate of
kJSNzQRJjRI,418720,420400,this meal
kJSNzQRJjRI,420400,422080,what you'll soon witness is one of the
kJSNzQRJjRI,422080,424479,biggest food fails in video broadcast
kJSNzQRJjRI,424479,426080,history trust me what i saw you don't
kJSNzQRJjRI,426080,427840,want to see with that said i'm still
kJSNzQRJjRI,427840,429360,hoping for the best i'm looking forward
kJSNzQRJjRI,429360,431090,to it
kJSNzQRJjRI,431090,434760,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,434960,436720,while the goat is roasting we're heading
kJSNzQRJjRI,436720,438479,out of the compound and deep into the
kJSNzQRJjRI,438479,438880,village
kJSNzQRJjRI,438880,440960,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,440960,443039,where you'll witness an unusual food
kJSNzQRJjRI,443039,447200,creation you'd never see in the city
kJSNzQRJjRI,447200,451440,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,452400,453680,we've gone even further into the
kJSNzQRJjRI,453680,455440,countryside here they're making a
kJSNzQRJjRI,455440,458240,specialty what is this so this is sugar
kJSNzQRJjRI,458240,460240,cane juice which is being condensed into
kJSNzQRJjRI,460240,463039,a hard form called good
kJSNzQRJjRI,463039,465199,ger a local treat made from reduced
kJSNzQRJjRI,465199,467680,sugar cane juice this is how sugar was
kJSNzQRJjRI,467680,469680,originally made in this region it looks
kJSNzQRJjRI,469680,471120,incredible i love the color i mean it
kJSNzQRJjRI,471120,472479,looks like they put a bunch of turmeric
kJSNzQRJjRI,472479,473919,in there it's like vibrant yellow it
kJSNzQRJjRI,473919,475680,looks fake almost it's the residuals
kJSNzQRJjRI,475680,477199,that are coming up from the sugar cane
kJSNzQRJjRI,477199,479440,juice it will even become more yellowish
kJSNzQRJjRI,479440,481120,and brownish towards the end as it
kJSNzQRJjRI,481120,483290,almost like caramelizes exactly
kJSNzQRJjRI,483290,487520,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,487520,489520,boiling down sugar cane juice until the
kJSNzQRJjRI,489520,492080,water evaporates and crystallized sugar
kJSNzQRJjRI,492080,494240,remains from this point still the last
kJSNzQRJjRI,494240,496400,product is going to take 15 to 20 more
kJSNzQRJjRI,496400,498400,minutes the cook adds in ghee or
kJSNzQRJjRI,498400,500879,clarified butter that is to make it soft
kJSNzQRJjRI,500879,502560,they don't put ghee in it the end
kJSNzQRJjRI,502560,505599,product will be a bit too hard
kJSNzQRJjRI,505599,507840,the sweet liquid becomes viscous it's
kJSNzQRJjRI,507840,508879,ready
kJSNzQRJjRI,508879,510479,fill the wooden mold with textured
kJSNzQRJjRI,510479,513360,treats like almonds pistachios raisins
kJSNzQRJjRI,513360,515599,and melon seeds then the thick sugar
kJSNzQRJjRI,515599,519000,cane goop
kJSNzQRJjRI,522320,524560,they've poured it all from this huge pan
kJSNzQRJjRI,524560,526320,into here i'm putting my hand just above
kJSNzQRJjRI,526320,528480,it it is still really hot this guy's
kJSNzQRJjRI,528480,529519,like you better not put your freaking
kJSNzQRJjRI,529519,531040,handprint in there i'm not gonna but i
kJSNzQRJjRI,531040,533360,might put my initials as it cools down
kJSNzQRJjRI,533360,534800,it's going to become thicker and thicker
kJSNzQRJjRI,534800,536240,eventually we're going to be able to eat
kJSNzQRJjRI,536240,537040,it
kJSNzQRJjRI,537040,539680,but it's still hot
kJSNzQRJjRI,539920,542000,we are near the final process right here
kJSNzQRJjRI,542000,543440,they kind of scrape it off they don't
kJSNzQRJjRI,543440,545200,exactly have like a scale or an official
kJSNzQRJjRI,545200,546720,measurement they just kind of see what
kJSNzQRJjRI,546720,548000,feels right in the moment should we try
kJSNzQRJjRI,548000,551279,it out yeah for sure let's go for it
kJSNzQRJjRI,551640,553279,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,553279,555519,whoa
kJSNzQRJjRI,556160,557519,oh how would you describe that reminds
kJSNzQRJjRI,557519,559519,me of korean corn tea but also you could
kJSNzQRJjRI,559519,561279,call it pakistani fudge the nuts and
kJSNzQRJjRI,561279,562560,fruit in there give it some lovely
kJSNzQRJjRI,562560,564399,texture it's so sweet so addictive
kJSNzQRJjRI,564399,566240,because it is just that reduced down
kJSNzQRJjRI,566240,568320,sugar what we call sugar right now is
kJSNzQRJjRI,568320,570000,something very recent before that people
kJSNzQRJjRI,570000,572000,actually use these chunks of good to
kJSNzQRJjRI,572000,573839,sweeten their desserts or the milk and
kJSNzQRJjRI,573839,575519,the teas people say that this is
kJSNzQRJjRI,575519,577200,healthier form of sugar i'm not saying
kJSNzQRJjRI,577200,578240,that's good for your health like you
kJSNzQRJjRI,578240,579839,should consume more but if you have to
kJSNzQRJjRI,579839,581600,have sugar might as well have this than
kJSNzQRJjRI,581600,583440,the sugar sugar this has so much more
kJSNzQRJjRI,583440,585600,character like salt and soy sauce aren't
kJSNzQRJjRI,585600,587120,the same same comparison here white
kJSNzQRJjRI,587120,591800,sugar and this not the same leather
kJSNzQRJjRI,593120,595120,back at our farmhouse preparations for
kJSNzQRJjRI,595120,598800,tonight's feast are in full swing
kJSNzQRJjRI,598959,601440,three hours have passed and it's finally
kJSNzQRJjRI,601440,603040,time to reveal the results of our
kJSNzQRJjRI,603040,605200,underground goat roast gentlemen it's a
kJSNzQRJjRI,605200,606959,big moment all day we've been building
kJSNzQRJjRI,606959,608480,up to this point right here in this
kJSNzQRJjRI,608480,610640,ground beneath this table there's a goat
kJSNzQRJjRI,610640,612320,it's either cooked or it's not cooked
kJSNzQRJjRI,612320,614320,this is the moment of truth our beloved
kJSNzQRJjRI,614320,616640,chef has few concerns that once we
kJSNzQRJjRI,616640,618640,untable this goat whether it's going to
kJSNzQRJjRI,618640,620800,be cooked or not oh boy
kJSNzQRJjRI,620800,622160,if we start down all the way pop it in
kJSNzQRJjRI,622160,623519,the microwave if we're in the village we
kJSNzQRJjRI,623519,625040,don't have a microwave
kJSNzQRJjRI,625040,626720,we put it back
kJSNzQRJjRI,626720,630920,back all right let's see
kJSNzQRJjRI,633680,635680,whoa here's the moment right now so they
kJSNzQRJjRI,635680,638880,need to carefully remove it
kJSNzQRJjRI,638959,640800,oh i've never seen a goat that looks
kJSNzQRJjRI,640800,642000,like that is this cooked because
kJSNzQRJjRI,642000,643920,sometimes it can look smoky and not
kJSNzQRJjRI,643920,645760,cooked but could be cooked what's the
kJSNzQRJjRI,645760,647040,chef saying
kJSNzQRJjRI,647040,649360,he seems satisfied but his voice is not
kJSNzQRJjRI,649360,650959,very reassuring yeah he's not radiating
kJSNzQRJjRI,650959,653839,confidence exactly
kJSNzQRJjRI,654079,656240,what does it feel like it feels medium
kJSNzQRJjRI,656240,658160,maybe medium rare since i forgot my meat
kJSNzQRJjRI,658160,659920,thermometer at home we'll have to take
kJSNzQRJjRI,659920,662160,the goat to the table cut into it and
kJSNzQRJjRI,662160,665120,see for ourselves
kJSNzQRJjRI,666240,667440,we have a couple different foods here
kJSNzQRJjRI,667440,669200,the first one is this what is this
kJSNzQRJjRI,669200,671839,for our appetizer bindi ghost chunks of
kJSNzQRJjRI,671839,674079,goat slow cooked with onion garlic
kJSNzQRJjRI,674079,676240,ginger cumin and kashmiri red chili
kJSNzQRJjRI,676240,678800,powder oh and don't forget the okra the
kJSNzQRJjRI,678800,680320,most vegetables i've seen since i got to
kJSNzQRJjRI,680320,681600,this country tons of okra let's try it
kJSNzQRJjRI,681600,681720,out
kJSNzQRJjRI,681720,683279,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,683279,685440,classic okra a little slimy super masala
kJSNzQRJjRI,685440,686959,spicy
kJSNzQRJjRI,686959,689839,oh my god incredibly spicy wow
kJSNzQRJjRI,689839,691279,but i feel like i can't scratch my
kJSNzQRJjRI,691279,693040,throat you actually have that aftertaste
kJSNzQRJjRI,693040,695279,when you try okra okra okra i'm talking
kJSNzQRJjRI,695279,698399,about the chilies i'm talking about okra
kJSNzQRJjRI,698399,700000,i do like the spiciness but it is
kJSNzQRJjRI,700000,702560,intense i tried some of the goat
kJSNzQRJjRI,702560,704880,very nice succulent juicy and so juicy
kJSNzQRJjRI,704880,706160,there's one more food here i want to try
kJSNzQRJjRI,706160,708560,that's a chicken right
kJSNzQRJjRI,708560,710560,this is chicken karaki dispatching of
kJSNzQRJjRI,710560,713120,the animal begins normal enough
kJSNzQRJjRI,713120,714720,but then something i've never seen
kJSNzQRJjRI,714720,716560,before rather than heating water and
kJSNzQRJjRI,716560,718560,feathering the bird both feathers and
kJSNzQRJjRI,718560,720720,skin are quickly removed together a bit
kJSNzQRJjRI,720720,722560,more wasteful but certainly a more
kJSNzQRJjRI,722560,724800,efficient method the secret about skin
kJSNzQRJjRI,724800,726560,is whenever we are making curries we
kJSNzQRJjRI,726560,727839,take the skin off but when we're
kJSNzQRJjRI,727839,729279,drilling the chicken that is when you
kJSNzQRJjRI,729279,731279,leave the skin the d skin chicken is
kJSNzQRJjRI,731279,733600,cooked with tomatoes garlic onions
kJSNzQRJjRI,733600,735839,ginger ghee and a local masala i can
kJSNzQRJjRI,735839,737760,feel such a difference coming here from
kJSNzQRJjRI,737760,739440,the city where we're eating street food
kJSNzQRJjRI,739440,740959,which is meant to be super rich and
kJSNzQRJjRI,740959,742639,decadent here it has a much more of a
kJSNzQRJjRI,742639,744000,home-cooked feel the flavors are a
kJSNzQRJjRI,744000,745839,little bit more gentle yes it's on the
kJSNzQRJjRI,745839,747360,milder side and this chicken is just not
kJSNzQRJjRI,747360,748880,just your ordinary chicken this is their
kJSNzQRJjRI,748880,750560,home raised organic desi chicken all
kJSNzQRJjRI,750560,752800,right i'm gonna try this out
kJSNzQRJjRI,752800,754560,oh yeah that's that organic chewiness
kJSNzQRJjRI,754560,758560,that's quite delicious very nice
kJSNzQRJjRI,758560,760240,gentlemen the whole community has
kJSNzQRJjRI,760240,762320,gathered here behind us right now this
kJSNzQRJjRI,762320,765120,is the future of pakistan watching us as
kJSNzQRJjRI,765120,767279,we reveal the status of this goat the
kJSNzQRJjRI,767279,768720,goat doesn't have to be well done it
kJSNzQRJjRI,768720,770959,could just be medium or medium rare or
kJSNzQRJjRI,770959,772720,completely uncooked so we don't know
kJSNzQRJjRI,772720,774880,because there is a thick cake of masala
kJSNzQRJjRI,774880,776800,on the outside so i feel like something
kJSNzQRJjRI,776800,778240,here has to be cooked and we're gonna
kJSNzQRJjRI,778240,780000,take a bite i'm gonna cut it open now
kJSNzQRJjRI,780000,781500,and see here we go
kJSNzQRJjRI,781500,784659,[Music]

kJSNzQRJjRI,789279,792000,cutting it open
kJSNzQRJjRI,793279,796320,that looks like half an inch roughly is
kJSNzQRJjRI,796320,797920,probably cooked and then under that
kJSNzQRJjRI,797920,800079,pretty raw i believe what i see on the
kJSNzQRJjRI,800079,803760,table is goat's revenge
kJSNzQRJjRI,804240,805839,right when it was being slaughtered i
kJSNzQRJjRI,805839,808079,could see in her eyes you can slaughter
kJSNzQRJjRI,808079,810560,me but you cannot eat me
kJSNzQRJjRI,810560,812480,i think if we skim the top a bit some
kJSNzQRJjRI,812480,814320,parts are done you want try these cheers

kJSNzQRJjRI,823600,825199,i do like that masala i think it's meant
kJSNzQRJjRI,825199,827600,to be cooked to be honest the outer
kJSNzQRJjRI,827600,829920,layer is fine yeah let's not go deep i'm
kJSNzQRJjRI,829920,831519,not trevor james i am not going deep

kJSNzQRJjRI,832880,834860,check the contents of the stomach
kJSNzQRJjRI,834860,838800,[Music]
kJSNzQRJjRI,838800,840160,all right looking pretty raw too i'm
kJSNzQRJjRI,840160,841760,going to just put that back

kJSNzQRJjRI,846820,848480,[Laughter]
kJSNzQRJjRI,848480,850079,listen this happens sometimes we went
kJSNzQRJjRI,850079,851680,for something epic something amazing
kJSNzQRJjRI,851680,852959,something i think this chef has not
kJSNzQRJjRI,852959,854320,tried himself before right this is from
kJSNzQRJjRI,854320,856720,a different region so it's like me you
kJSNzQRJjRI,856720,858320,know like banana bread i can make that
kJSNzQRJjRI,858320,860079,nope can't do it same thing here so he
kJSNzQRJjRI,860079,861519,had the idea the principles were in
kJSNzQRJjRI,861519,862720,place just slipped a little bit on the
kJSNzQRJjRI,862720,864480,execution my guess is that there was not
kJSNzQRJjRI,864480,866079,enough coals the coals probably cooled
kJSNzQRJjRI,866079,867600,down too much when we put it in there
kJSNzQRJjRI,867600,868959,and i think when they bricked it up even
kJSNzQRJjRI,868959,870320,they kicked some dirt down and that
kJSNzQRJjRI,870320,872079,covered up even more coals so firefly
kJSNzQRJjRI,872079,873760,went out an hour after it went in there
kJSNzQRJjRI,873760,874770,could be thousand reasons
