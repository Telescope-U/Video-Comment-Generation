Xwt4v_ReJj4,124640,126159,the round brush
Xwt4v_ReJj4,126159,128479,it's good for like flowers
Xwt4v_ReJj4,128479,131440,this shader is good for blending shading
Xwt4v_ReJj4,131440,133760,and the flat brush is good for squares
Xwt4v_ReJj4,133760,136480,lines with sharp edges the fan brush is
Xwt4v_ReJj4,136480,138560,good for like trees
Xwt4v_ReJj4,138560,142599,and then the wash brush
Xwt4v_ReJj4,145840,149239,only god
Xwt4v_ReJj4,153030,159400,[Music]

Xwt4v_ReJj4,183440,185310,fold it into half
Xwt4v_ReJj4,185310,187280,[Music]
Xwt4v_ReJj4,187280,190400,sketch your design
Xwt4v_ReJj4,191519,194800,trace it with pen optional
Xwt4v_ReJj4,194800,197800,erase
Xwt4v_ReJj4,198879,203040,color it you can use markers to
Xwt4v_ReJj4,206400,207920,take the front
Xwt4v_ReJj4,207920,211319,and the back
Xwt4v_ReJj4,218480,219580,cut the edges
Xwt4v_ReJj4,219580,223040,[Music]
Xwt4v_ReJj4,223040,226400,tape the edges except for one side
Xwt4v_ReJj4,226400,228400,now put the stuffings
Xwt4v_ReJj4,228400,231599,i use plastic tape it after
Xwt4v_ReJj4,231599,233920,done
Xwt4v_ReJj4,236000,237760,so my classroom is open for lunch time
Xwt4v_ReJj4,237760,239120,and students eat lunch in my classroom
Xwt4v_ReJj4,239120,240480,and i don't have to let them but they do
Xwt4v_ReJj4,240480,241680,because it's fun the beginning of the
Xwt4v_ReJj4,241680,243519,year there was a student who comes in to
Xwt4v_ReJj4,243519,245760,eat lunch and um they curse all the time
Xwt4v_ReJj4,245760,247040,just like
Xwt4v_ReJj4,247040,249439,curse words up the wazoo left and right
Xwt4v_ReJj4,249439,250640,and it's lunchtime so i don't really
Xwt4v_ReJj4,250640,252400,police them kind of like it's the day to
Xwt4v_ReJj4,252400,254400,fill with my own money and it's just
Xwt4v_ReJj4,254400,255840,cause like sometimes you're having a bad
Xwt4v_ReJj4,255840,257440,day and you know you want to use snack
Xwt4v_ReJj4,257440,259199,here's my snack bowl if you're hungry
Xwt4v_ReJj4,259199,260639,have a snack i don't want anyone to be
Xwt4v_ReJj4,260639,262240,hungry and cranky and rude just like
Xwt4v_ReJj4,262240,264080,have a snack and now there are several
Xwt4v_ReJj4,264080,265440,kids in the building who just come to my
Xwt4v_ReJj4,265440,267040,room each day to like have a fruit roll
Xwt4v_ReJj4,267040,268400,up and say hello and i think that's
Xwt4v_ReJj4,268400,270080,great and so i'd been feeling it all
Xwt4v_ReJj4,270080,272080,year using my own money and i figured i
Xwt4v_ReJj4,272080,273919,would use the swear jar money
Xwt4v_ReJj4,273919,275680,long story short 30 didn't actually get
Xwt4v_ReJj4,275680,277919,me very far in the snack bowl world and
Xwt4v_ReJj4,277919,280479,i figured i have this uh platform here
Xwt4v_ReJj4,280479,281680,and i should just make an amazon
Xwt4v_ReJj4,281680,283199,wishlist so if any of you would like to
