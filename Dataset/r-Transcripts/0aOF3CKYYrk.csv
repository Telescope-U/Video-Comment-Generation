0aOF3CKYYrk,1960,3586,- A lot of people look at what Zipline does
0aOF3CKYYrk,3586,5255,"and assume it's  total science fiction,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,5255,6339,"and it's a decade away,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,6339,8758,but the reality is actually it's ready today.
0aOF3CKYYrk,10510,12762,"There's an opportunity to build a totally, radically,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,12762,14806,new kind of logistics system for the planet.
0aOF3CKYYrk,15515,17267,We wanted to build the first logistic system
0aOF3CKYYrk,17267,19102,that would serve  all people equally.
0aOF3CKYYrk,20687,22063,The idea is simple;
0aOF3CKYYrk,22063,24274,the technology required to do it is complicated.
0aOF3CKYYrk,25608,27944,- What Zipline's experience has taught us
0aOF3CKYYrk,27944,30447,"is that the technology  is ready, right?"
0aOF3CKYYrk,30447,32198,"We're able to  serve people today,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,32198,33950,with the technologies  of today.
0aOF3CKYYrk,35326,37162,- If we want to make instant delivery scale
0aOF3CKYYrk,37162,38454,"for every person on Earth,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,38455,40081,we need to be  doing that using
0aOF3CKYYrk,40081,41875,"small, electric vehicles;"
0aOF3CKYYrk,41875,43376,"that can be operated autonomously,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,43376,46420,and that are 10 times as fast as traditional logistics.
0aOF3CKYYrk,54971,56097,- The drone is certainly the most visible part
0aOF3CKYYrk,56097,59184,"of what we do, but there's a whole set of technologies"
0aOF3CKYYrk,59184,61643,we've developed that really enable us to do what we do.
0aOF3CKYYrk,62937,65565,This ranges from  software we've built
0aOF3CKYYrk,65565,66441,that enable the regulators
0aOF3CKYYrk,66441,68860,to oversee our aircraft  in their airspace.
0aOF3CKYYrk,68860,70653,It includes sensing technologies
0aOF3CKYYrk,70653,72363,"to sense other aircraft  and avoid them,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,72363,73990,"route planning software,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,73990,75867,weather forecasting tools.
0aOF3CKYYrk,75867,77951,- It's one thing to create a product that works
0aOF3CKYYrk,77952,79329,the way it's supposed to every time;
0aOF3CKYYrk,79329,81414,it's another thing to  create an operation
0aOF3CKYYrk,81414,83708,that works the way it's supposed to every time.
0aOF3CKYYrk,83708,85502,And that's from  start to finish—
0aOF3CKYYrk,85502,87837,"from how the product is designed, manufactured,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,87837,90673,"flown, maintained, and then how at the end of the day"
0aOF3CKYYrk,90673,92424,provides a service  to a customer.
0aOF3CKYYrk,92425,94135,"And at Zipline,  we do all of that."
0aOF3CKYYrk,94928,96554,- The current system  can deliver
0aOF3CKYYrk,96554,98723,basically a 100%  of medical products
0aOF3CKYYrk,98723,101392,"and almost 85%  of traditional packages,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,101392,102644,just moving to eCommerce.
0aOF3CKYYrk,103436,106605,"Any of our partners can pull out the phone, press a button,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,106606,109150,"and instantly request an autonomous, instant delivery"
0aOF3CKYYrk,109150,110151,of a product that they need.
0aOF3CKYYrk,110527,113154,"- That order goes out, it gets put into a Zip,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,113154,115323,"the Zip gets put onto a launcher, it's launched,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,115323,117033,and now it's flying autonomously
0aOF3CKYYrk,117033,118493,out to the delivery site.
0aOF3CKYYrk,118493,120494,"When it gets there, it drops the package from the air,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,120495,122330,"the Zip turns around,  flies back, lands,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,122330,123915,and is ready for the next zip.
0aOF3CKYYrk,123915,125208,"And at any given time,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,125208,127752,"we have dozens of Zips in the air doing exactly that,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,127752,128962,to different parts of a country.
0aOF3CKYYrk,128962,131548,- Countries that have shown initiative are using it
0aOF3CKYYrk,131548,134050,transform health systems and totally change the way
0aOF3CKYYrk,134050,135552,that their national infrastructure works.
0aOF3CKYYrk,136636,140557,- Welcome to the Fulfillment Operations area.
0aOF3CKYYrk,140557,141850,"We have medical  products stored,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,141850,143309,"the blood products  are stored,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,143309,145061,"where the vaccines  are also kept,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,145061,146980,and where the products are generally packaged
0aOF3CKYYrk,146980,149607,and sent across to  the health facilities.
0aOF3CKYYrk,150817,155864,"Across the country, we serve 1,600+ health facilities."
0aOF3CKYYrk,155864,158074,- It's very difficult  for rural areas
0aOF3CKYYrk,158074,161077,to store critical medical products on-site.
0aOF3CKYYrk,161077,163663,And so what we  are doing in Zipline
0aOF3CKYYrk,163663,167250,is to ensure that the supply chain is revolutionized
0aOF3CKYYrk,167250,169586,into a system  that is very responsive
0aOF3CKYYrk,169586,172088,to what is actually happening on the field.
0aOF3CKYYrk,172088,173882,- Five and a half  million children
0aOF3CKYYrk,173882,175800,lose their lives every year due to lack of access
0aOF3CKYYrk,175800,177760,to basic medical products.
0aOF3CKYYrk,177760,179262,The technology has  gotten to a point
0aOF3CKYYrk,179262,180847,where there are  no more excuses.
0aOF3CKYYrk,180847,184309,"You could put every single person within the country,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,184309,186186,within 15 to 25  minute delivery
0aOF3CKYYrk,186186,187562,of any essential  medical product.
0aOF3CKYYrk,187562,191191,- Being able to make the supply chain so responsive
0aOF3CKYYrk,191191,193151,so that they can  vaccinate children
0aOF3CKYYrk,193151,194861,"against some of  the killer diseases,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,194861,197864,and people can receive that same quality of care
0aOF3CKYYrk,197864,200700,"wherever they are, is very impactful to see."
0aOF3CKYYrk,200700,203578,- It has changed the system for us for the better.
0aOF3CKYYrk,203578,206789,"We are a 100% sure of product availability,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,206789,208166,even when there's shortage.
0aOF3CKYYrk,208625,211336,Plans are in place to cover the whole country
0aOF3CKYYrk,211336,214589,so that every single facility in the country
0aOF3CKYYrk,214589,216507,"will have access to  the right commodity,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,216507,218426,"at the right place,  at the right time."
0aOF3CKYYrk,219969,222972,"- Having operated for as long as Zipline has,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,222972,225934,we wanted to be thoughtful  in how we lead
0aOF3CKYYrk,225934,228061,"so that not only can Zipline be successful,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,228061,230063,but the industry  can be successful.
0aOF3CKYYrk,230063,231814,- As Zipline has brought our
0aOF3CKYYrk,231814,233775,"autonomous, instant logistics to the U.S.,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,233775,235610,we've been pretty  excited to see
0aOF3CKYYrk,235610,237362,that there are some  big companies
0aOF3CKYYrk,237362,240156,and health systems in the U.S. who share our vision
0aOF3CKYYrk,240156,243368,for what instant logistics can mean at national scale.
0aOF3CKYYrk,243368,244619,"- If it's the middle of the night,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,244619,246371,"you need a thermometer, or you need diapers,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,246371,248873,"whatever it might be, you know, technologies like this"
0aOF3CKYYrk,248873,251084,could solve that problem  for customers.
0aOF3CKYYrk,251084,253795,But what if it could land on their driveway in 10 minutes?
0aOF3CKYYrk,253795,255588,It would completely transform the way you think
0aOF3CKYYrk,255588,257215,"about the items you want,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,257215,260009,and the life that  you want to lead.
0aOF3CKYYrk,260009,262178,Customers here in Pea Ridge and the surrounding area
0aOF3CKYYrk,262178,263638,will get access
0aOF3CKYYrk,263638,266224,"to the most cutting-edge delivery mechanism,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,266224,269060,"anywhere in the U.S.,  before anyone else."
0aOF3CKYYrk,269060,273398,90% of America lives within about 10 miles of a Walmart.
0aOF3CKYYrk,273398,275316,"The demand’s already there,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,275316,277485,"the items are already nearby,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,277485,278778,and we need something  to close the gap
0aOF3CKYYrk,278778,280196,between the two.
0aOF3CKYYrk,280196,282532,"- If you live in a New York, if you live in a Singapore,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,282532,283491,"if you live in a London,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,283491,285368,you don't realize  how convenient
0aOF3CKYYrk,285368,286661,your life has become
0aOF3CKYYrk,286661,288413,because you have access.
0aOF3CKYYrk,288413,290164,"And even within  those communities,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,290164,292959,"there are food deserts, there are pharmacy deserts."
0aOF3CKYYrk,292959,296004,- Zipline adds a new dimension to access.
0aOF3CKYYrk,296004,299465,"You know, historically, transport has been a barrier"
0aOF3CKYYrk,299465,300883,to achieving good health care.
0aOF3CKYYrk,300883,302302,Health care should  be delivered
0aOF3CKYYrk,302302,304846,"as close to home as possible,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,304846,306723,"where, when,  and how people want it,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,306723,308349,and they should be able  to afford it.
0aOF3CKYYrk,308349,309892,"And our partnership  with Zipline,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,309892,311352,"I think, is really designed  to do that."
0aOF3CKYYrk,312145,313646,- If you can pull out a phone
0aOF3CKYYrk,313646,316357,"and talk to a doctor quickly and get a diagnosis,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,316357,319110,"the health system should also have a way of saying,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,319110,321029,"""Great! That product  is gonna be on"
0aOF3CKYYrk,321029,322363,your doorstep in 5 minutes!
0aOF3CKYYrk,322363,324490,"So you can stay at home  and get better."""
0aOF3CKYYrk,324490,325616,- This is going to be
0aOF3CKYYrk,325616,327618,one of the most important tools for us
0aOF3CKYYrk,327618,330204,to deliver highly equitable health care to people.
0aOF3CKYYrk,330204,332707,"- We want to build  that magical,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,332707,335501,"simple, experience that approximates teleportation."
0aOF3CKYYrk,339756,343468,"- When I think about how Zipline, not just as a product"
0aOF3CKYYrk,343468,346345,"but as a service, could make people's lives better—"
0aOF3CKYYrk,346346,351059,"that for me, feels like a basic, universal, human need."
0aOF3CKYYrk,352018,354187,There is a real societal cost
0aOF3CKYYrk,354187,356898,"to not bring in these access opportunities,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,356898,358775,"these potential  environmental benefits,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,358775,360902,safety benefits  to communities.
0aOF3CKYYrk,361235,364530,And the idea that we wouldn't need as many roads
0aOF3CKYYrk,364530,367283,"in order to transport goods back and forth,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,367283,369952,in order to make sure people still had access
0aOF3CKYYrk,369952,370828,"to the things they needed,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,370828,373664,but we could instead use that ground to live—
0aOF3CKYYrk,374457,375583,what a novel idea!
0aOF3CKYYrk,375583,378586,- It wasn't that long ago that it seemed really normal to us
0aOF3CKYYrk,378586,380838,"that you would actually write a letter by hand,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,380838,383591,and then pay someone to deliver it on horseback.
0aOF3CKYYrk,383591,386969,That is how we're doing logistics today is gonna feel
0aOF3CKYYrk,386969,389931,"once people are used to electric, autonomous,"
0aOF3CKYYrk,389931,392558,instant logistics systems.
