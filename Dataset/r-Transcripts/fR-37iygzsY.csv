fR-37iygzsY,39840,43015,hey guys welcome to my home studio
fR-37iygzsY,43015,46559,it's finally time for a big oil painting
fR-37iygzsY,46560,49943,i will talk about what being alone can give to you
fR-37iygzsY,49943,52880,when you see it as a positive influence in your life
fR-37iygzsY,53520,56240,and explain the process of this oil painting  
fR-37iygzsY,57200,61920,at first i cut the fitting size for the frame and staple it to the wood  
fR-37iygzsY,64559,69623,and then i let rabbit skin glue rest in water for about 20 minutes
fR-37iygzsY,70159,73899,in the meantime i wipe the dust off from my easel
fR-37iygzsY,73900,76000,because it's been a while since i have painted
fR-37iygzsY,79120,83519,rabbit skin glue is a traditional way of preparing a canvas
fR-37iygzsY,84116,89382,it creates a protective layer between the fabric and the gesso that you apply afterwards
fR-37iygzsY,89888,93622,there's also an alternative medium that i recently found
fR-37iygzsY,93622,99602,the name is pva it's a synthetic glue which you can use straight out of a bottle
fR-37iygzsY,100138,106800,unfortunately it was sold out online and at the art stores  and i will give it a try for another painting
fR-37iygzsY,108960,113280,there are different ways of how you can apply the glue onto your canvas  
fR-37iygzsY,113280,115760,you have to find out what works best for you
fR-37iygzsY,121840,126079,after the glue has dried i apply three layers of gesso  
fR-37iygzsY,126080,129520,each layer has to dry before applying the next one
fR-37iygzsY,132480,134879,and please remember to have windows open
fR-37iygzsY,134879,138928,and ventilate your room whenever you paint or prepare your canvas
fR-37iygzsY,138928,141060,even though it says it's not toxic
fR-37iygzsY,141061,142720,just do it it's better for you
fR-37iygzsY,146320,149650,the day before i visited my local art store
fR-37iygzsY,149650,154655,i can't stress enough how important it is to go out on your own
fR-37iygzsY,155315,158555,if you feel uncomfortable try to go out in the morning
fR-37iygzsY,159045,164188,there is almost nobody on the streets and even less people in the stores
fR-37iygzsY,170467,176517,and it's also a good idea to go out on your own because there's nobody you can ask for an opinion
fR-37iygzsY,176976,180810,you have to go through that monologue in your head
fR-37iygzsY,180810,182226,ask yourself the questions
fR-37iygzsY,182961,184265,do i need this
fR-37iygzsY,185000,187029,for what am i going to use it
fR-37iygzsY,187427,189680,can i afford this and so on
fR-37iygzsY,191120,195200,after multiple times of going through those monologues in your head  
fR-37iygzsY,195200,200239,the ability of making fast and reasonable  decisions will become your second nature  
fR-37iygzsY,201920,206240,and when a miss becomes easy to you  you will be able to make more difficult  
fR-37iygzsY,206240,213333,decisions with confidence and i promise  you everything will make sense to you
fR-37iygzsY,266640,271040,being alone also teached me  how much time i actually have  
fR-37iygzsY,271680,278479,and my excuses were fear of failure and let's  be honest lack of discipline and laziness
fR-37iygzsY,280800,286479,and maybe it's the opinion or the talk of other  people behind your back what's holding you back  
fR-37iygzsY,288000,292400,my personal experience is that they  will talk about you whatever you do  
fR-37iygzsY,293280,298960,and if they want to waste their time  by talking about other people let them  
fR-37iygzsY,300960,306400,you have better things to do instead of dealing  and wasting your energy with those things  
fR-37iygzsY,307280,310720,as long as you get to know  yourself and gain confidence  
fR-37iygzsY,310720,317600,by educating yourself keeping body and mind  healthy do something that is meaningful to you  
fR-37iygzsY,318240,325240,and care about those few healthy and meaningful  relationships you don't have to fear anything
fR-37iygzsY,326787,332251,and also be aware with what and who you let yourself be  surrounded
fR-37iygzsY,332880,337044,influence comes from inside and outside
fR-37iygzsY,360800,367125,i changed my clothes and we are going to  school because i can't be that loud at home
fR-37iygzsY,410800,414400,i like to prepare and get  everything ready on my workspace  
fR-37iygzsY,414400,421530,before i begin to paint that way i  don't get distracted and stay focused
fR-37iygzsY,451509,455395,everything i'm talking about takes time  be patient
fR-37iygzsY,455395,457759,patience applies to painting too
fR-37iygzsY,458720,466537,for example you paint a portrait and all the time  you are thinking about adding those reflections  in the eyes
fR-37iygzsY,466537,471919,sometimes you are so impatient and  add them in the early stages of your painting  
fR-37iygzsY,471920,475448,or put a lot of focus on making that part look nice
fR-37iygzsY,475448,479319,you don't even prioritize getting the fundamentals right
fR-37iygzsY,479319,484678,"composition, shape, proportion, value, color"
fR-37iygzsY,484678,486810,and in the end you make the details
fR-37iygzsY,487132,491564,say no to instant gratification you get by  painting those dots in the eyes
fR-37iygzsY,491993,498887,sometimes i don't even paint the details and after a week i realized that i actually wanted to paint her earrings
fR-37iygzsY,498887,504345,but i forgot about them because i  was so focused about the fundamentals
fR-37iygzsY,504345,509120,and the painting felt complete even without any other details
fR-37iygzsY,599360,602541,i love to listen to audiobooks while painting
fR-37iygzsY,602541,604124,do that too
fR-37iygzsY,604320,606320,choose topics you could find interesting
fR-37iygzsY,607040,611759,sometimes i'll leave some recommendations in  the description box down below so check it out  
fR-37iygzsY,614880,617931,and when my painting process allows me to
fR-37iygzsY,617931,620960,i let a movie or documentary play in the background
fR-37iygzsY,623040,627414,make sure to also enjoy the  process of whatever you do
fR-37iygzsY,682240,686972,do you guys remember when i said  i'm not ready for a big  painting yet
fR-37iygzsY,686973,690160,and then i switched  to these tiny gouache paintings  
fR-37iygzsY,691120,698378,it helped me so much because i was reflective  and honest towards my abilities as a painter
fR-37iygzsY,803680,805936,sometimes it gets too much at home
fR-37iygzsY,805936,807602,so you have to go out okay
fR-37iygzsY,807603,809405,find your balance in life
fR-37iygzsY,809405,812377,being alone and also being with other people
fR-37iygzsY,812377,814023,and what i also do is
fR-37iygzsY,814023,816664,i go to ugly places sometimes
fR-37iygzsY,816664,818365,or i see ugly places
fR-37iygzsY,818365,821700,then i appreciate my space even more
fR-37iygzsY,821700,824480,sometimes when you have that really deep phase
fR-37iygzsY,824480,825441,just go out
fR-37iygzsY,825441,828355,take a friend or go by yourself
fR-37iygzsY,828356,830880,be careful everything seems nice i know but
fR-37iygzsY,832640,834043,oh a butterfly
fR-37iygzsY,834043,835616,always be careful
fR-37iygzsY,835616,836788,So I hear the street
fR-37iygzsY,837600,838363,there :)
fR-37iygzsY,838364,840000,Let´s go home!
