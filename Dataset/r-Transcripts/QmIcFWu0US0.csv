QmIcFWu0US0,110,2129,So I uploaded a video recently
QmIcFWu0US0,2130,5100,where I compared the brand new M2 MacBook Pro
QmIcFWu0US0,5100,8580,"against its predecessor, the M1 MacBook Pro."
QmIcFWu0US0,8580,11730,"But during testing, I noticed a really weird issue"
QmIcFWu0US0,11730,13920,with the SSD on the M2.
QmIcFWu0US0,13920,16470,It was nowhere near as fast as the M1.
QmIcFWu0US0,16470,18869,And this could have a massive impact
QmIcFWu0US0,18870,22350,on the performance of M2 MacBook Pro base models.
QmIcFWu0US0,22350,24390,So what could be the reason for this?
QmIcFWu0US0,24390,26220,Is it just Apple being greedy?
QmIcFWu0US0,26220,27900,Is it some secret plan to get you
QmIcFWu0US0,27900,29730,to spend more money on upgrades
QmIcFWu0US0,29730,33600,or was Apple forced to do this by external circumstances?
QmIcFWu0US0,33600,35340,"Well, I'm going to do a deep dive"
QmIcFWu0US0,35340,36180,into this topic
QmIcFWu0US0,36180,38130,and see if we can figure it out.
QmIcFWu0US0,38130,41040,"First things first, let's run some SSD speed tests"
QmIcFWu0US0,41040,44400,to find out just how bad the M2 SSD is.
QmIcFWu0US0,44400,46860,"Starting with Blackmagic Disk Speed Test,"
QmIcFWu0US0,46860,50070,you can immediately see a massive difference in speeds.
QmIcFWu0US0,50070,53940,The M2 is roughly twice as slow in read speeds.
QmIcFWu0US0,53940,55980,"On the AJA System Speed Test,"
QmIcFWu0US0,55980,58410,"but this time with the disk cache disabled,"
QmIcFWu0US0,58410,60780,"the write speeds seem about the same,"
QmIcFWu0US0,60780,64739,"but the read speeds, again, are significantly worse."
QmIcFWu0US0,64739,66390,So what the hell is going on here?
QmIcFWu0US0,66390,69150,Isn't the M2 supposed to be the faster
QmIcFWu0US0,69150,72120,and more improved clone of M1?
QmIcFWu0US0,72120,74970,"Well, to find out, let's open these two machines up"
QmIcFWu0US0,74970,76560,and have a look inside.
QmIcFWu0US0,76560,78600,"Taking a look at the M2, you can see"
QmIcFWu0US0,78600,81840,that there's only one NAND flash chip soldered on
QmIcFWu0US0,81840,84479,with a big old empty space to the left.
QmIcFWu0US0,84480,85313,So it seems
QmIcFWu0US0,85313,89760,that Apple is using a single 256 gigabyte NAND flash chip
QmIcFWu0US0,89760,92280,on these base model M2 MacBooks.
QmIcFWu0US0,92280,95159,"When I compared with the base model M1 MacBook Pro,"
QmIcFWu0US0,95160,97260,"oh, look, there's a second chip!"
QmIcFWu0US0,97260,102150,It looks like the M1 is using two 128 gigabyte NAND chips
QmIcFWu0US0,102150,106770,"instead of one big 256 gigabyte chip, like the M2."
QmIcFWu0US0,106770,108090,So I did some more digging
QmIcFWu0US0,108090,109829,and read through some of my comments
QmIcFWu0US0,109830,113970,and it looks like Max Tech also has only one NAND chip
QmIcFWu0US0,113970,115380,"on their M2 MacBook,"
QmIcFWu0US0,115380,117000,which basically confirms to me
QmIcFWu0US0,117000,121230,that this is widespread across all M2 Pro base models.
QmIcFWu0US0,121230,122490,"So this begs the question,"
QmIcFWu0US0,122490,126570,why is having two smaller NAND chips actually faster
QmIcFWu0US0,126570,128310,than having one big one?
QmIcFWu0US0,128310,131520,"Well, by using two of them, it allows each one to connect"
QmIcFWu0US0,131520,134460,to the M1 or M2 controller separately
QmIcFWu0US0,134460,136860,and fill two buses in parallel.
QmIcFWu0US0,136860,138810,"No, not school buses."
QmIcFWu0US0,138810,141569,I mean the communication system that transfers data
QmIcFWu0US0,141570,144270,between components inside a computer.
QmIcFWu0US0,144270,147810,"Think of a bus as a data highway of sorts,"
QmIcFWu0US0,147810,151050,having two NAND chips using two separate buses
QmIcFWu0US0,151050,153630,is like having two lanes instead of just one
QmIcFWu0US0,153630,154800,on a highway.
QmIcFWu0US0,154800,158310,Traffic or data will be able to flow much quicker
QmIcFWu0US0,158310,159569,with two lanes.
QmIcFWu0US0,159570,160680,"So on the M1,"
QmIcFWu0US0,160680,163560,"you are basically getting double the available bandwidth,"
QmIcFWu0US0,163560,166950,which results in a doubling of the read and write speeds.
QmIcFWu0US0,166950,168270,"Now, if you're familiar with RAID,"
QmIcFWu0US0,168270,170370,it's kind of like using RAID 0.
QmIcFWu0US0,170370,172890,"Although, Apple doesn't technically use RAID,"
QmIcFWu0US0,172890,174690,they have their own way of doing it.
QmIcFWu0US0,174690,176190,"As an extreme example,"
QmIcFWu0US0,176190,178950,here's my 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro
QmIcFWu0US0,178950,180989,with a four terabyte SSD.
QmIcFWu0US0,180990,184290,"The speeds on this MacBook are insanely fast,"
QmIcFWu0US0,184290,186540,at least twice as fast as the M1.
QmIcFWu0US0,186540,190110,And you can see why. Look at all those NAND chips.
QmIcFWu0US0,190110,192780,So why is the SSD performance decrease
QmIcFWu0US0,192780,195959,on the base model M2 MacBook Pro a bad thing?
QmIcFWu0US0,195960,198210,"Well, there are a couple of reasons why."
QmIcFWu0US0,198210,200580,"Number one, I don't really like the fact"
QmIcFWu0US0,200580,203670,that this is technically an upgraded M1 chip
QmIcFWu0US0,203670,206700,but we are seeing decreased performance on the SSD.
QmIcFWu0US0,206700,208410,It doesn't really make sense to me.
QmIcFWu0US0,208410,211740,"Seriously, if you check out the M1 versus M2 MacBook Pro"
QmIcFWu0US0,211740,213210,"comparison video I made,"
QmIcFWu0US0,213210,216780,the M2 outperforms the M1 in every area.
QmIcFWu0US0,216780,219720,Sometimes by a whopping 30%.
QmIcFWu0US0,219720,222330,I'll link that video in case you want to check it out.
QmIcFWu0US0,222330,224820,Another reason why these slower SSD speeds
QmIcFWu0US0,224820,226140,might be a bad thing is
QmIcFWu0US0,226140,228210,if you are simply reading and writing files
QmIcFWu0US0,228210,229710,"onto the SSD, right?"
QmIcFWu0US0,229710,232980,So if you are editing video or photo files
QmIcFWu0US0,232980,234120,on the SSD
QmIcFWu0US0,234120,236400,or if you're transferring on and off the SSD
QmIcFWu0US0,236400,238319,"to an external drive, for example,"
QmIcFWu0US0,238320,240450,all of that is going to be slower.
QmIcFWu0US0,240450,241920,Also the slower speeds
QmIcFWu0US0,241920,245280,are going to impact overall snappiness and speed
QmIcFWu0US0,245280,247470,of the system due to swap memory.
QmIcFWu0US0,247470,250680,"Now, swap memory essentially makes your computer faster."
QmIcFWu0US0,250680,253620,It's existed for a very long time and is actually used
QmIcFWu0US0,253620,255540,"on almost all operating systems,"
QmIcFWu0US0,255540,258900,"including macOS, Linux, and also Windows."
QmIcFWu0US0,258900,261419,Its purpose is to move processes and programs
QmIcFWu0US0,261420,264450,"that aren't currently being used out of physical memory,"
QmIcFWu0US0,264450,265470,"which is your RAM,"
QmIcFWu0US0,265470,267240,"and onto virtual memory,"
QmIcFWu0US0,267240,269970,which is essentially just temporarily writing
QmIcFWu0US0,269970,272580,and then reading this data from your SSD.
QmIcFWu0US0,272580,274020,"Now, I have an entire video"
QmIcFWu0US0,274020,275819,on the subject of Mac SSDs
QmIcFWu0US0,275820,277800,"that goes into this in more detail,"
QmIcFWu0US0,277800,279090,which I will link.
QmIcFWu0US0,279090,281669,"But in a nutshell, if you have a base model MacBook"
QmIcFWu0US0,281670,283650,"with only eight gigabytes of RAM,"
QmIcFWu0US0,283650,287370,this swap process is actually going to happen fairly often.
QmIcFWu0US0,287370,289470,"For example, when doing intensive work"
QmIcFWu0US0,289470,292020,"like rendering or extreme multitasking,"
QmIcFWu0US0,292020,293400,the eight gigabytes of RAM
QmIcFWu0US0,293400,296280,"on the M2 gets maxed out straight away,"
QmIcFWu0US0,296280,299520,and I've seen the M2 need to use up to six gigabytes
QmIcFWu0US0,299520,301889,of swap memory to cope with the workload
QmIcFWu0US0,301890,303420,in worst-case scenarios.
QmIcFWu0US0,303420,306390,And the speed of your SSD will have a big impact
QmIcFWu0US0,306390,307500,on this process.
QmIcFWu0US0,307500,309270,Swap memory uses a mixture
QmIcFWu0US0,309270,311610,"of sequential and random reads and writes,"
QmIcFWu0US0,311610,313500,and you likely won't notice a big difference
QmIcFWu0US0,313500,314520,"for the random stuff,"
QmIcFWu0US0,314520,318180,but you definitely will for sequential as you can see here.
QmIcFWu0US0,318180,321479,"Now, to be fair, the M2 is still more powerful"
QmIcFWu0US0,321480,324120,and has an increased unified memory bandwidth
QmIcFWu0US0,324120,325560,when compared to M1.
QmIcFWu0US0,325560,327180,So it's still probably faster
QmIcFWu0US0,327180,328919,even with the slower SSD.
QmIcFWu0US0,328920,332700,Also the M2 seems to be using LPDDR5 memory
QmIcFWu0US0,332700,335100,instead of DDR4 on the M1.
QmIcFWu0US0,335100,338970,"So in general, the RAM is slightly faster on M2 as well"
QmIcFWu0US0,338970,341760,as you can see in this amorphous memory benchmark.
QmIcFWu0US0,341760,343680,So I think that nerfing the SSD
QmIcFWu0US0,343680,346530,is just such a weird performance bottleneck to put
QmIcFWu0US0,346530,347550,on the system.
QmIcFWu0US0,347550,348479,And it's a shame
QmIcFWu0US0,348480,350850,because out of all the changes Apple made
QmIcFWu0US0,350850,352620,"from M1 to M2,"
QmIcFWu0US0,352620,355350,keeping the SSD the same as the previous generation
QmIcFWu0US0,355350,357360,is literally the easiest one.
QmIcFWu0US0,357360,358860,And it's even more of a shame
QmIcFWu0US0,358860,361229,because it might actually have a negative impact
QmIcFWu0US0,361230,363720,on the overall performance of the M2
QmIcFWu0US0,363720,367680,at least on the 256 gigabyte base model.
QmIcFWu0US0,367680,370440,"Now, I'm going to play devil's advocate and defend Apple"
QmIcFWu0US0,370440,371273,for a second here
QmIcFWu0US0,371273,373980,because there may actually be some legitimate reasons
QmIcFWu0US0,373980,377190,why they went with one NAND flash memory chip
QmIcFWu0US0,377190,378690,instead of two.
QmIcFWu0US0,378690,380220,"So first, let's be honest,"
QmIcFWu0US0,380220,384720,you can't do much with a 256 gigabyte SSD anyway.
QmIcFWu0US0,384720,386400,"If you are video or photo editing,"
QmIcFWu0US0,386400,389220,"it's likely going to be on an external SSD,"
QmIcFWu0US0,389220,392370,same with storing and transferring large amounts of files.
QmIcFWu0US0,392370,393203,"And at the end of the day,"
QmIcFWu0US0,393203,395670,this is a base model MacBook we're talking about.
QmIcFWu0US0,395670,398130,Most people aren't really going to be pushing the SSD
QmIcFWu0US0,398130,399030,to its limits.
QmIcFWu0US0,399030,400980,So they probably won't even notice the difference
QmIcFWu0US0,400980,402420,in speed to begin with.
QmIcFWu0US0,402420,404130,"And if they are power users,"
QmIcFWu0US0,404130,407610,"they'll likely get at least a 512 gigabyte SSD,"
QmIcFWu0US0,407610,409860,which as we can see from existing videos
QmIcFWu0US0,409860,411030,on the M2 MacBook
QmIcFWu0US0,411030,413550,is just as fast as the previous generation
QmIcFWu0US0,413550,417930,because it's using 256 gigabyte NAND chips.
QmIcFWu0US0,417930,420750,It's funny how Apple always sends out the upgraded models
QmIcFWu0US0,420750,423030,"for the early access reviews, isn't it?"
QmIcFWu0US0,423030,425400,"I mean, if you look at all the big tech publications"
QmIcFWu0US0,425400,427050,"like The Verge, for example,"
QmIcFWu0US0,427050,430500,they were actually sent upgraded 16 gigabyte RAM
QmIcFWu0US0,430500,434430,and 512 gigabyte SSD M2 MacBook Pros.
QmIcFWu0US0,434430,436169,It's almost as if Apple is trying
QmIcFWu0US0,436170,439110,to make their new product look as good as possible.
QmIcFWu0US0,439110,441780,"Also, don't forget like I've mentioned in previous videos,"
QmIcFWu0US0,441780,444210,"I mean, there is a massive global silicon"
QmIcFWu0US0,444210,445889,and chip shortage right now.
QmIcFWu0US0,445890,449160,So it might just be that Apple simply cannot get their hands
QmIcFWu0US0,449160,452190,on enough 128 gigabyte SSDs.
QmIcFWu0US0,452190,454830,But what is often the case with corporations is
QmIcFWu0US0,454830,456330,that they're just cost cutting.
QmIcFWu0US0,456330,460199,Why buy 128 gigabyte SSDs and mix and match
QmIcFWu0US0,460200,463310,when you can just bulk order millions of 256
QmIcFWu0US0,463310,465470,or 512 gigabyte SSDs.
QmIcFWu0US0,465470,468150,It just makes sense from a corporate point of view.
QmIcFWu0US0,468150,470220,I like to think that there was an Apple engineer
QmIcFWu0US0,470220,471360,that went to corporate one day
QmIcFWu0US0,471360,473849,"and asked, hey guys, should we continue"
QmIcFWu0US0,473850,475410,to use two NAND chips
QmIcFWu0US0,475410,477000,"on the M2 MacBook Pro,"
QmIcFWu0US0,477000,479460,"and corporate just kind of going like, eh, nah,"
QmIcFWu0US0,479460,480293,we don't need that.
QmIcFWu0US0,480293,481320,Just get rid of it.
QmIcFWu0US0,481320,483000,And the engineer just kind of shrugs his shoulders
QmIcFWu0US0,483000,484050,and just walks away.
QmIcFWu0US0,484050,486569,"So yeah, really interesting decision from Apple."
QmIcFWu0US0,486570,487470,"Like I said before,"
QmIcFWu0US0,487470,489780,I don't think it's going to have a massive impact
QmIcFWu0US0,489780,492090,on most people's workflow.
QmIcFWu0US0,492090,494220,"I don't think you'll see a massive difference,"
QmIcFWu0US0,494220,497970,especially because that base model SSD is just so small
QmIcFWu0US0,497970,498930,to begin with.
QmIcFWu0US0,498930,501720,But what I think is going to be interesting is
QmIcFWu0US0,501720,505050,seeing what Apple does with the new M2 MacBook Air.
QmIcFWu0US0,505050,508440,And if they use the same one NAND chip strategy
QmIcFWu0US0,508440,510900,for the base model M2 MacBook Airs.
QmIcFWu0US0,510900,513599,"But apart from that, guys, hopefully you enjoyed this video,"
QmIcFWu0US0,513599,516032,and I'll catch you in the next one.
