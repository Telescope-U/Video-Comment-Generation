_yyR0NCfBWM,80,1839,so if you look on the back of a lot of
_yyR0NCfBWM,1839,4720,cereals you can see that they contain
_yyR0NCfBWM,4720,6160,iron
_yyR0NCfBWM,6160,8160,so this iron that it contains is
_yyR0NCfBWM,8160,10559,actually metallic iron so if you crush
_yyR0NCfBWM,10559,12240,up the cheerios and put it in a bag and
_yyR0NCfBWM,12240,16519,then pour some water in it
_yyR0NCfBWM,17279,19920,and then get a big neodymium magnet so
_yyR0NCfBWM,19920,23840,just start rubbing it against the bag
_yyR0NCfBWM,24240,26160,should very soon start seeing some
_yyR0NCfBWM,26160,29880,particles in there
_yyR0NCfBWM,30000,33920,so you can see the iron in the back now
_yyR0NCfBWM,33920,35280,now when companies put these iron
_yyR0NCfBWM,35280,36800,particles in your cheerios i think it's
_yyR0NCfBWM,36800,38000,kind of cheating because you don't
_yyR0NCfBWM,38000,39920,actually need metallic iron in your body
_yyR0NCfBWM,39920,41840,you need ionic iron so you're supposed
_yyR0NCfBWM,41840,43680,to get it in ionic form not in this
_yyR0NCfBWM,43680,45520,metal form now some of this metallic
_yyR0NCfBWM,45520,47440,iron does turn into ions in your body
_yyR0NCfBWM,47440,49520,but a very little amount so most of this
_yyR0NCfBWM,49520,51440,iron just passes through you in metallic
_yyR0NCfBWM,51440,53199,form so you're actually getting way less
_yyR0NCfBWM,53199,57199,iron than you think from your cereal
