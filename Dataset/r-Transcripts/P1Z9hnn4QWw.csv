P1Z9hnn4QWw,5274435,5282810,THE PAST TWO YEARS IN DEFENSIVE  RUNS SAVED.  THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE  OF HIS CANNON AT SHORT.  SCOTT: HE WON A PLATINUM GLOVE
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5282810,5290251,LAST YEAR IN THE AMERICAN  LEAGUE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5290251,5298092,"YONDER: I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY  WANT HIM TO CONTINUE TO THROW  THAT SINKER OR FOUR-SEAMER,"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5298092,5303364,ESPECIALLY TOP OF THE ZONE.  I THINK HE HAS SEEN TOO MANY  ALREADY IN FRAZIER.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5303364,5310371,"HE'S GOT A GOOD SLIDER, GOOD  CHANGEUP.  HE DOES NOT THROW THE CHANGEUP  AS MUCH."
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5310371,5315777,THEY WILL TRY AND GET HIM ONE  MORE TIME.  HE WAS LATE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5315777,5323618,"SONNY IS SPOTTING UP IN THE  ZONE.  SONNY, WHEN I FACED HIM, AS WE"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5323618,5334695,"SEE THE FACE BALL -- THE  FASTBALL UP IN THE ZONE , H  RELIEDE ON TWO-SEAMERS -- HE"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5334695,5341135,"RELIED ON TWO-SEAMERS DOWN IN  THE ZONE.  IF HE'S GOING TO THAT ALL THE  TIME, IT'S HARD TO HIT."
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5341135,5346140,"IT MIGHT GO UP AND IN AGAIN.  SCOTT: CONTACT, BUT THIS IS NOT"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5346140,5352513,GOING TO BRING THE RUNNER HOME.  YONDER: THOSE ARE JUST WELL
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5352513,5359820,LOCATED PITCHES.  FIRST STRESSFUL SITUATION FOR  SONNY GRAY RIGHT NOW.  HE HAS CERTAINLY DELIVERED SO
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5359820,5367962,FAR.  BIG AT-BATS BY FRANCE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5367962,5374202,"SCOTT: THE LEADOFF MAN TO THIRD,"

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5393220,5398960,GOT TO BAIL YOUR TEAMMATES OUT.  SCOTT: THIS IS THE ACE FOR THE  TWINS.  IT IS THAT FASTBALL UP IN THE
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5398960,5406067,ZONE.  GAME ONE IN A PLAYOFF SERIES IS  PROBABLY SONNY GRAY.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5406067,5411472,SONNY HAS DIRT IN HIS CLEATS AND  A NICE POSTSEASON RESUME.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5411472,5420348,YONDER: HE'S BASICALLY REPLACING
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5420348,5427455,HIM.  THEY EXPECT MANY BIG THINGS FROM  HIM.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5427455,5432760,SCOTT: A BALL AND STRIKE TO
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5432760,5438199,FRANCE.  YONDER: FRANCE WAS LOOKING FOR  SOMETHING UP AND IN.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5438199,5447408,MAYBE SONNY CAN EXECUTE  SOMETHING DOWN AND AWAY HERE.  SCOTT: FINISHING OUR FIRST POLL
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5447408,5453114,"QUESTION, BAIL STARTING FIRST IN  THE ALL-STAR GAME, FRANCE OVER  ARRAEZ."

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5475169,5481275,YONDER: NOT WITH TY.  SCOTT: NOPE.  HE CAN ADJUST ON ANYTHING.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5481275,5487280,"1-2.  YONDER: THAT IS WHAT WE SEE WITH  TY FRANCE, HIS ABILITY TO"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5487280,5494355,CONTINUE THESE LONG STREAKS OF  HITTING BALLS HARD CONSISTENTLY  IS TO CONTROL THE STRIKE ZONE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5494355,5500394,"YOU RARELY SEE A GUY SWINGING AT  A PITCH OUT OF THE STRIKE ZONE.  OBVIOUSLY IT HAPPENS, BUT HE IS"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5500394,5505933,A GUY WHO STAYS RELATIVELY  CONSISTENT AT SWINGING AT THE  RIGHT PITCHES.  IF THERE IS A WINDOW WHERE YOU
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5505933,5511839,"WANT TO GET SOMEONE OUT WITH TY,  IT OUGHT TO BE UP THE LADDER."
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5511839,5517044,SCOTT: RUNS A FULL COUNT.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5517044,5527254,"FRANCE YESTERDAY CRACKED HIS  10TH HOME RUN OF THE SEASON.  POWER NUMBERS ARE UP FOR HIM  THIS YEAR.  A TWO RUN SMACK, POLED ONE OFF"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5527254,5532326,"JOE RYAN, ACTUALLY KNOCK HIM OUT  OF THE GAME IN THE FIFTH.  LAST YEAR 18 HOME RUNS FOR  FRANCE."
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5532326,5547008,HE'S ALREADY AT DOUBLE DIGITS.  WE ARE NOT A THIRD INTO THE  SEASON?  IN THT -- IN THAT RANGE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5547008,5555883,"I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE BOTH  FROM FRANCE AND ARRAEZ AS THEY  ARE BOTH GREAT HITTERS, FOUL OFF"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5555883,5561989,TOUGH PITCHES.  YONDER: THEY GET HIT BY PITCHES.

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5568763,5574969,"PLATE.  HE'S SUCH ON TOP OF THE PLATE  WHEN WE LOOK AT HIS RIGHT FOOT,"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5574969,5582143,HE REALLY LIKES THE BALL  METAL-MIDDLE IN.  I CERTAINLY THINK A GOOD
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5582143,5588916,TWO-SEAMER IN WILL PROBABLY PAY  DIVIDENDS.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5588916,5594922,"HE HAS THROWN SOME SINKERS UP.  SONNY GRAY'S BEST TWO-SEAMER  DOWN UNDERWAY, HE'S TRYING TO"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5594922,5604365,FREEZE HIM.  WE SEE SONNY WALK AROUND THE  MOUND.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5604365,5609904,HERE WE GO.  LOOK AT HOW TOP OF THE PLATE SHE
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5609904,5617244,HAS.  HE'S ON THE CHALK WANTING TO  THROW IN ON ME.  AS A PITCHER YOU WANT TO RUN

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5649944,5655316,THAT IS PERFECT PLACEMENT FROM  SONNY GRAY.  YONDER: WE TALK ABOUT THAT
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5655316,5662857,"TWO-SEAMER WHERE YOU WANT TO SHY  AWAY, BUT THAT WAS SONNY GRAY'S  BEST TWO-SEAMER OF THE DAY.  SCOTT: THREE CONSECUTIVE OUTS"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5662857,5668396,AFTER THE LEADOFF MAN GETS TO  THIRD.  THAT IS WHY WE STILL ARE  SCORELESS WITH THREE IN THE  BOOKS IN SEATTLE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5766694,5774368,SCOTT: WE ARE OPENING UP THE  FOURTH INNING AT T-MOBILE PARK.  ZERO SO FAR.  WHAT A PITCH FROM SONNY GRAY TO

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5784778,5791352,YONDER: WAS IT REGGIE WHO SAID  THEY DON'T BOO BAD PLAYERS?
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5791352,5797558,SCOTT: CORREA JUST 2-16 IN HIS
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5797558,5802930,"CAREER AGAINST MARCO GONZALES,  BUT HE'S ON A HEATER LATELY.  2-4 YESTERDAY, MULTI-HIT GAMES  IN 4-5."

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5816177,5822816,YONDER: THIS IS A GREAT  SITUATION.  HE WAS THE FIRST OVERALL PICK IN
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5822816,5828756,THE 2012 DRAFT.  YOU KNOW WHO WAS THE NEXT GUY?  BYRON BUXTON.  PRETTY GOOD 1-2 COMBO.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5828756,5836063,SCOTT: THEY MADE FRIENDS DAY ONE  WHEN CARLOS STEPPED FOOT IN
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5836063,5844905,TWINS CAMP.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5844905,5850945,THEY HAVE COMPLEMENTED EACH  OTHER WELL IN THE CLUBHOUSE.  THAT IS GOLFED.

P1Z9hnn4QWw,5962122,5967327,CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME A QUARTER?  I NEED TO FLIP THIS.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5967327,5973600,IT'S SUCH A TOUGH QUESTION.  BOTH TEAMS HAVE THE ABILITY TO  GET INTO THE POSTSEASON.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5973600,5980107,"WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS ROSTER,  ROSTERS, THEY PUT HAVE THE  ABILITY TO GET IN."
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5980107,5987147,"THEY PLAY GOOD DEFENSE, HAVE  GOOD HITTERS.  PATIENT AND BULLPEN IS PROBABLY"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,5987147,5992252,THE ONE CONCERN BOTH TEAMS WANT  TO UPDATE ON.  BUT THESE GUYS ARE PLAYING GOOD

P1Z9hnn4QWw,6219346,6224985,THEY ASKED ME WHICH PITCH OUT OF  ANY OF OUR PITCHER'S REPERTOIRE
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6224985,6232192,WE WOULD TAKE AND I SAY THE  CHANGEUP.  YONDER: I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO  YOUR LAST START WITH BOSTON.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6232192,6237364,IT WAS SHARP AND DISGUSTING.  ROBBIE: ADDING THAT TO SEEM

P1Z9hnn4QWw,6360921,6367894,PITCHING EVERY GAME LIKE IT IS  YOUR LAST.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOUR LAST  PITCH IS GOING TO BE.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6367894,6376203,"PUTTING PURPOSE BEHIND EVERY  PITCH LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR  LAST, THAT AND THE BULLDOG"

P1Z9hnn4QWw,6382576,6387848,I REMEMBER FACING HIM WITH THE  D-BACKS AND THOUGHT THIS IS A  ROLLER COASTER.  IT WAS NOT FUN.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6387848,6394421,"I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE MORE  THING, THE ANALYTICAL STUFF, HOW"
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6394421,6400060,NOWADAYS MOST GUYS ARE SO  ANALYTICAL AND EVERY TIME THEY  ARE DONE PITCHING THEY WANT TO  SEE WHAT IS WORKING.  HAVE YOU MADE ADJUSTMENTS WITH
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6400060,6405932,THAT?  ROBBIE: I TRY NOT TO GET TOO.
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6405932,6414541,ANALYTICAL  ABOUT THINGS I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN  LOOK AT TOO MANY NUMBERS AND GET  BOGGED DOWN BY ALMOST PITCHING

P1Z9hnn4QWw,6433894,6441668,WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.  YONDER: YOU ARE MORE OLD-SCHOOL  WITH A LITTLE NEW SCHOOL AT  TIMES?  SCOTT: A BIT OF THE MIX FOR
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6441668,6447007,SURE.  OLD-SCHOOL WAS THE MUSTACHE.  WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE  STACHE?
P1Z9hnn4QWw,6447007,6452912,ROBBIE: I CAN GROW FACIAL HAIR  PRETTY QUICKLY.  GIVE ME TWO WEEKS AND IT WILL BE

P1Z9hnn4QWw,6800326,6806833,THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD ATHLETES  ON THE OUTFIELD.  TRAMMELL COULD BE A SAFETY RIGHT  NOW IN THE NFL IF HE WANTED TO.
