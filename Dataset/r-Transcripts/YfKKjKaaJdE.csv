YfKKjKaaJdE,3360,5359,this is your tech news briefing for
YfKKjKaaJdE,5359,8720,friday june 24th i'm zoe thomas for the
YfKKjKaaJdE,8720,11679,wall street journal
YfKKjKaaJdE,12639,15599,july marks one year since andy jassy
YfKKjKaaJdE,15599,18160,took over as ceo of amazon
YfKKjKaaJdE,18160,20560,for amazon insiders he was a familiar
YfKKjKaaJdE,20560,23119,face he spent more than two decades
YfKKjKaaJdE,23119,24800,there and had been running the cloud
YfKKjKaaJdE,24800,27359,computing division amazon web services
YfKKjKaaJdE,27359,29359,the company's cash cow
YfKKjKaaJdE,29359,31439,but since his promotion it's been a
YfKKjKaaJdE,31439,34399,bumpy ride one that's forced him to undo
YfKKjKaaJdE,34399,36320,some decisions made by his mentor and
YfKKjKaaJdE,36320,39200,the company's founder jeff bezos
YfKKjKaaJdE,39200,41360,to break down what jassy's first year as
YfKKjKaaJdE,41360,43920,ceo has been like and what it tells us
YfKKjKaaJdE,43920,46160,about the e-commerce giant's future is
YfKKjKaaJdE,46160,49600,our amazon reporter dana matioli hi dana
YfKKjKaaJdE,49600,51199,thanks for being here hi thanks for
YfKKjKaaJdE,51199,52399,having me
YfKKjKaaJdE,52399,55199,so dana what situation did jesse inherit
YfKKjKaaJdE,55199,57039,when he first took over
YfKKjKaaJdE,57039,60879,andy started on july 5th 2021 and if you
YfKKjKaaJdE,60879,62879,remember that was a time when people
YfKKjKaaJdE,62879,65920,were still relying on e-commerce and
YfKKjKaaJdE,65920,68240,you know when earnings were coming in
YfKKjKaaJdE,68240,71280,companies like amazon were just killing
YfKKjKaaJdE,71280,73439,it they were you know above their
YfKKjKaaJdE,73439,75439,estimates and amazon actually posted
YfKKjKaaJdE,75439,77439,record earnings so that's sort of the
YfKKjKaaJdE,77439,79920,amazon he walked into taking over but
YfKKjKaaJdE,79920,81840,behind the scenes things had started to
YfKKjKaaJdE,81840,83680,change you know customers had become
YfKKjKaaJdE,83680,85200,more comfortable shopping in person
YfKKjKaaJdE,85200,86880,again they actually liked it it wasn't
YfKKjKaaJdE,86880,88320,you know viewed as a chore it was nice
YfKKjKaaJdE,88320,89680,to get out and about
YfKKjKaaJdE,89680,91520,and all of this infrastructure that
YfKKjKaaJdE,91520,93439,amazon built to deal with this
YfKKjKaaJdE,93439,96000,unprecedented demand became too much
YfKKjKaaJdE,96000,98880,just given the change in shopping habits
YfKKjKaaJdE,98880,101200,and so how has jesse been dealing with
YfKKjKaaJdE,101200,103040,that change what's he been doing to help
YfKKjKaaJdE,103040,106000,amazon through this shifting period
YfKKjKaaJdE,106000,108079,once he took over it quickly became
YfKKjKaaJdE,108079,111360,apparent that there are plans for this
YfKKjKaaJdE,111360,113520,massive build-out of more warehousing
YfKKjKaaJdE,113520,116399,and sortation centers and logistics
YfKKjKaaJdE,116399,117360,network
YfKKjKaaJdE,117360,120399,was way too big they weren't going to
YfKKjKaaJdE,120399,122240,need all that so quickly they started
YfKKjKaaJdE,122240,125119,just slashing their forecasts on that
YfKKjKaaJdE,125119,127600,build out and part of the plan has been
YfKKjKaaJdE,127600,129840,to sublease all the space that they
YfKKjKaaJdE,129840,132480,bought to delay building these very
YfKKjKaaJdE,132480,134879,expensive warehouses that they don't
YfKKjKaaJdE,134879,136239,need right now
YfKKjKaaJdE,136239,138400,and to stop hiring in the warehouses
YfKKjKaaJdE,138400,139760,because they don't need quite as many
YfKKjKaaJdE,139760,141599,people fulfilling these orders if
YfKKjKaaJdE,141599,143520,there's fewer than they were expecting
YfKKjKaaJdE,143520,145840,how did amazon end up in this situation
YfKKjKaaJdE,145840,148480,kind of overestimating how much capacity
YfKKjKaaJdE,148480,150000,it was going to need on the e-commerce
YfKKjKaaJdE,150000,150879,side
YfKKjKaaJdE,150879,152800,so back during you know the darkest days
YfKKjKaaJdE,152800,154480,of the pandemic you know before a
YfKKjKaaJdE,154480,157040,vaccine was like even on anyone's mind
YfKKjKaaJdE,157040,158640,amazon became flooded with all these
YfKKjKaaJdE,158640,160720,orders at the time jeff bezos was still
YfKKjKaaJdE,160720,163360,ceo and the company has this credo of
YfKKjKaaJdE,163360,165760,quote-unquote customer obsession
YfKKjKaaJdE,165760,167440,and basically that means doing whatever
YfKKjKaaJdE,167440,169360,it takes for the customer and i don't
YfKKjKaaJdE,169360,170800,know if you remember this but people
YfKKjKaaJdE,170800,172480,were hoarding toilet paper back then in
YfKKjKaaJdE,172480,174640,hand sanitizer and you know there were
YfKKjKaaJdE,174640,176000,shortages on the shelves because
YfKKjKaaJdE,176000,177280,everyone was just taking whatever they
YfKKjKaaJdE,177280,180080,can get and amazon was a destination for
YfKKjKaaJdE,180080,181599,a lot of this so they were running out
YfKKjKaaJdE,181599,182239,of
YfKKjKaaJdE,182239,185040,you know inventory their quick shipping
YfKKjKaaJdE,185040,187040,of two days extended to like more than a
YfKKjKaaJdE,187040,188879,month on some items so they greenlighted
YfKKjKaaJdE,188879,191120,this very very aggressive plan to grow
YfKKjKaaJdE,191120,193440,quickly to meet that demand the problem
YfKKjKaaJdE,193440,195200,with plans like that is that you can't
YfKKjKaaJdE,195200,196720,just turn the switch on overnight in
YfKKjKaaJdE,196720,199200,order to grow to meet that demand you
YfKKjKaaJdE,199200,201360,have to make capital allocation
YfKKjKaaJdE,201360,203760,decisions that take two years to execute
YfKKjKaaJdE,203760,206239,so while they committed to the spend and
YfKKjKaaJdE,206239,207920,building out these centers and all of
YfKKjKaaJdE,207920,208799,that
YfKKjKaaJdE,208799,211280,march 2020 it takes two years for them
YfKKjKaaJdE,211280,212640,to come online and that's where we are
YfKKjKaaJdE,212640,213599,now
YfKKjKaaJdE,213599,215599,so all of that extra capacity is coming
YfKKjKaaJdE,215599,217599,online now and jassy's saying you know
YfKKjKaaJdE,217599,220000,hey maybe we don't need it he's looking
YfKKjKaaJdE,220000,222799,at cuts and subleasing but how is that
YfKKjKaaJdE,222799,225040,being read inside amazon what do people
YfKKjKaaJdE,225040,227360,think of his leadership style i've heard
YfKKjKaaJdE,227360,228879,that there hasn't been you know any
YfKKjKaaJdE,228879,230560,disagreement between
YfKKjKaaJdE,230560,232480,those cuts and you know the people that
YfKKjKaaJdE,232480,233680,are implementing the cuts everyone
YfKKjKaaJdE,233680,235200,agrees that they were a little bit too
YfKKjKaaJdE,235200,236480,aggressive here
YfKKjKaaJdE,236480,238640,where there is some daylight is andy's
YfKKjKaaJdE,238640,240879,management style so he went from
YfKKjKaaJdE,240879,242959,managing cloud computing at amazon which
YfKKjKaaJdE,242959,244640,was very siloed off of the rest of
YfKKjKaaJdE,244640,246400,amazon and so different
YfKKjKaaJdE,246400,247280,you know it's not really a
YfKKjKaaJdE,247280,249599,consumer-facing business it's b2b
YfKKjKaaJdE,249599,251519,it's very technical it's tons of
YfKKjKaaJdE,251519,253200,engineers you know
YfKKjKaaJdE,253200,256079,the rest of amazon is you know shopping
YfKKjKaaJdE,256079,259199,prime it's alexa it's
YfKKjKaaJdE,259199,261120,just very different than cloud computing
YfKKjKaaJdE,261120,264479,and at aws andy was a very very hands-on
YfKKjKaaJdE,264479,265600,manager
YfKKjKaaJdE,265600,268080,in the details in the weeds whereas at
YfKKjKaaJdE,268080,270639,amazon you know there are
YfKKjKaaJdE,270639,272800,lots of senior leaders who could be ceos
YfKKjKaaJdE,272800,274320,of publicly traded companies on their
YfKKjKaaJdE,274320,276080,own that's how big their orgs are
YfKKjKaaJdE,276080,277680,running things and you had jeff bezos
YfKKjKaaJdE,277680,279680,sort of floating above as the ceo that
YfKKjKaaJdE,279680,280720,was not
YfKKjKaaJdE,280720,283520,at least in recent years very hands-on
YfKKjKaaJdE,283520,286479,and now that andy's the ceo i think part
YfKKjKaaJdE,286479,288720,of it is any new ceo would sort of make
YfKKjKaaJdE,288720,290240,the rounds and understand the business
YfKKjKaaJdE,290240,292160,and ask lots of questions but his
YfKKjKaaJdE,292160,294240,attention to detail and
YfKKjKaaJdE,294240,295600,his different ways of managing have
YfKKjKaaJdE,295600,297759,rubbed some people the wrong way and it
YfKKjKaaJdE,297759,299199,even was part of the reason that the
YfKKjKaaJdE,299199,301440,person in charge of all of the consumer
YfKKjKaaJdE,301440,303199,business and logistics business decided
YfKKjKaaJdE,303199,305360,to leave in the middle of this problem
YfKKjKaaJdE,305360,307759,what about in terms of amazon's board or
YfKKjKaaJdE,307759,309440,its investors what do they think of
YfKKjKaaJdE,309440,310960,jassy's style
YfKKjKaaJdE,310960,313919,the board is has really backed him
YfKKjKaaJdE,313919,315680,they think he's the right person to lead
YfKKjKaaJdE,315680,317919,the company in this time
YfKKjKaaJdE,317919,319280,investors have been a little bit less
YfKKjKaaJdE,319280,321199,patient you know the stock is down more
YfKKjKaaJdE,321199,324639,than 30 since andy took over and wall
YfKKjKaaJdE,324639,327120,street's not the most patient bunch and
YfKKjKaaJdE,327120,329919,because amazon employees are
YfKKjKaaJdE,329919,331919,compensated heavily in stock it's also
YfKKjKaaJdE,331919,334160,an issue on that front because
YfKKjKaaJdE,334160,335600,that's like a significant pay cut for a
YfKKjKaaJdE,335600,336960,lot of these employees and it could
YfKKjKaaJdE,336960,339840,cause people to leave or become antsy so
YfKKjKaaJdE,339840,341199,that is something that they will have to
YfKKjKaaJdE,341199,343759,figure out do we know what his plans are
YfKKjKaaJdE,343759,346400,to kind of move the business forward and
YfKKjKaaJdE,346400,348479,i guess maybe step out of the shadow of
YfKKjKaaJdE,348479,350800,jeff bezos a bit i think you know a lot
YfKKjKaaJdE,350800,352880,of his time will be dedicated to growth
YfKKjKaaJdE,352880,355280,you know like advertising is this
YfKKjKaaJdE,355280,357039,really big area for them that's really
YfKKjKaaJdE,357039,358639,high profit and it's growing really
YfKKjKaaJdE,358639,360479,quickly and project kuiper which is
YfKKjKaaJdE,360479,363440,small but of interest and there's all
YfKKjKaaJdE,363440,365039,these other areas that
YfKKjKaaJdE,365039,366880,could become the next growth areas but
YfKKjKaaJdE,366880,369600,he's also having to you know reel in
YfKKjKaaJdE,369600,371039,some things that aren't working you know
YfKKjKaaJdE,371039,373360,physical stores was launched under jeff
YfKKjKaaJdE,373360,375280,bezos and
YfKKjKaaJdE,375280,377280,they made a very significant cut there
YfKKjKaaJdE,377280,379440,they closed almost every physical store
YfKKjKaaJdE,379440,380960,except for grocery
YfKKjKaaJdE,380960,382400,in the last few months because it just
YfKKjKaaJdE,382400,385039,wasn't working so i think because andy
YfKKjKaaJdE,385039,387680,is new and he has this opportunity to
YfKKjKaaJdE,387680,389280,meet with all the division heads and go
YfKKjKaaJdE,389280,390479,over the numbers and ask all the
YfKKjKaaJdE,390479,392160,questions you could see some other
YfKKjKaaJdE,392160,394479,things get cut that he doesn't deem
YfKKjKaaJdE,394479,395919,worthy enough of keeping within the
YfKKjKaaJdE,395919,397039,company
YfKKjKaaJdE,397039,399600,all right so some changes coming to the
YfKKjKaaJdE,399600,401919,everything store i guess
YfKKjKaaJdE,401919,403600,all right that was our reporter dana
