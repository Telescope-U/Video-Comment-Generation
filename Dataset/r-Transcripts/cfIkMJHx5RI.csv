cfIkMJHx5RI,336479,338880,i have my problems sometimes i don't
cfIkMJHx5RI,338880,341199,like noodles as much so it looks like i
cfIkMJHx5RI,341199,343680,got a little bit of carrot
cfIkMJHx5RI,343680,345600,a little bit of i think that's a chicken
cfIkMJHx5RI,345600,347759,or something pork in there got some
cfIkMJHx5RI,347759,349840,greens in there
cfIkMJHx5RI,349840,353440,i like it a lot

cfIkMJHx5RI,355360,358240,is really good here i honestly got this
cfIkMJHx5RI,358240,359919,done it's just a texture person yeah i
cfIkMJHx5RI,359919,361600,like the news you don't like the texture
cfIkMJHx5RI,361600,362880,though
cfIkMJHx5RI,362880,364720,this is up there for me
cfIkMJHx5RI,364720,367039,i don't
cfIkMJHx5RI,374240,377360,i don't know i just know this is cabbage

cfIkMJHx5RI,381440,382160,no
cfIkMJHx5RI,382160,384400,i'm not a fan of this one a big reason
cfIkMJHx5RI,384400,386240,literally is because of the
cfIkMJHx5RI,386240,387360,noodles
cfIkMJHx5RI,387360,388960,but the meat is good in there you try
cfIkMJHx5RI,388960,390720,this little orange you honestly probably
cfIkMJHx5RI,390720,392560,don't even hate the taste of the noodles
cfIkMJHx5RI,392560,395440,it's just like the texture what is this
cfIkMJHx5RI,395440,397199,an orange right
cfIkMJHx5RI,397199,399199,no what is it
cfIkMJHx5RI,399199,400960,it's kind of good though
cfIkMJHx5RI,400960,402639,i don't know
cfIkMJHx5RI,402639,404319,it's like a little orange it's dangerous
cfIkMJHx5RI,404319,406479,good though i'm not gonna lie
cfIkMJHx5RI,406479,409720,kind of fire
cfIkMJHx5RI,410560,412319,we're gonna rank every meal at the end
cfIkMJHx5RI,412319,414400,okay okay all right i said it i'm gonna
cfIkMJHx5RI,414400,415599,save this
cfIkMJHx5RI,415599,417759,oh you like it yeah i really like it the
cfIkMJHx5RI,417759,422000,next thing we have is the adabo chicken
cfIkMJHx5RI,422000,424240,so it comes with rice and then this is
cfIkMJHx5RI,424240,426000,the chicken in here and then a little
cfIkMJHx5RI,426000,429280,salad so do you like i think you can
cfIkMJHx5RI,429280,431520,like mix it all up yeah that's what i'm
cfIkMJHx5RI,431520,433520,assuming should we like pour it in there
cfIkMJHx5RI,433520,436400,and then shake it yeah i mean yeah let's
cfIkMJHx5RI,436400,437919,do it i don't know if that's like the
cfIkMJHx5RI,437919,439599,right way to do it but you know it might
cfIkMJHx5RI,439599,440960,be
cfIkMJHx5RI,440960,443520,chicken rice rice shake it up like a
cfIkMJHx5RI,443520,446160,salad yeah so if we're doing this wrong
cfIkMJHx5RI,446160,447120,hey
cfIkMJHx5RI,447120,448319,or you could just dump it right here we
cfIkMJHx5RI,448319,451840,can just take bites of each one
cfIkMJHx5RI,451840,454160,okay so this is what it's looking like
cfIkMJHx5RI,454160,456240,that looks good
cfIkMJHx5RI,456240,458400,i'm gonna take some chicken dip it in
cfIkMJHx5RI,458400,462160,the rice dip it in the salad okay
cfIkMJHx5RI,463520,466400,it really tastes like a taco oh my god
cfIkMJHx5RI,466400,467520,yeah
cfIkMJHx5RI,467520,470240,it really does yes it's good as hell we
cfIkMJHx5RI,470240,472639,should mix it now because the juices can
cfIkMJHx5RI,472639,474879,get like yeah and the rice it tastes
cfIkMJHx5RI,474879,476800,legit like a straight top
cfIkMJHx5RI,476800,480000,that's crazy i don't want to mess it up
cfIkMJHx5RI,480000,482160,you might have messed it up yeah
cfIkMJHx5RI,482160,484080,and honestly if you're not like a salad
cfIkMJHx5RI,484080,484960,fan
cfIkMJHx5RI,484960,486800,that's cool and you mix it up you just
cfIkMJHx5RI,486800,488080,hear the crunch you don't really taste
cfIkMJHx5RI,488080,490560,the salad
cfIkMJHx5RI,490560,493360,okay it's mixed up okay let's try again
cfIkMJHx5RI,493360,494879,let me see let me see real quick let me
cfIkMJHx5RI,494879,496319,show them let us know if we're doing
cfIkMJHx5RI,496319,498080,this completely we probably are doing it
cfIkMJHx5RI,498080,500479,wrong but we do it what makes it work
cfIkMJHx5RI,500479,503680,for us okay so i got i need some rice
cfIkMJHx5RI,503680,506319,all right
cfIkMJHx5RI,506319,507840,it tastes like a chocolate it tastes
cfIkMJHx5RI,507840,509440,like a taco and if you want you know
cfIkMJHx5RI,509440,511039,would make it really good you know what
cfIkMJHx5RI,511039,513839,is that taco salad taco sauce that
cfIkMJHx5RI,513839,515599,literally is just like a taco that's
cfIkMJHx5RI,515599,516719,crazy
cfIkMJHx5RI,516719,518399,or which is weird
cfIkMJHx5RI,518399,520479,no let us know in the comments if it's
cfIkMJHx5RI,520479,521919,supposed to taste like a taco or it's
cfIkMJHx5RI,521919,523919,just our taste buds weird over here it
cfIkMJHx5RI,523919,525760,has to be that we just weird because
cfIkMJHx5RI,525760,527200,there's no way that this tastes like

cfIkMJHx5RI,540320,544560,meal we have it's called sig
cfIkMJHx5RI,544560,546160,it's like the same thing but i think
cfIkMJHx5RI,546160,548560,this is pork instead of chicken okay but
cfIkMJHx5RI,548560,550320,like we should do the same thing like
cfIkMJHx5RI,550320,551920,eat it separately and then shake it up
cfIkMJHx5RI,551920,554160,okay and see if it tastes like similar
