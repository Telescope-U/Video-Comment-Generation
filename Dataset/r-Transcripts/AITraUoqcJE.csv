AITraUoqcJE,10320,12480,after creating a gaming experience that
AITraUoqcJE,12480,14799,defined an entire genre
AITraUoqcJE,14799,16960,and carefully preserved its reputation
AITraUoqcJE,16960,19920,by only releasing a sequel once a decade
AITraUoqcJE,19920,21680,discover what happens when blizzard
AITraUoqcJE,21680,23920,sheds every designer that matters and
AITraUoqcJE,23920,26240,finally falls prey to the eventuality
AITraUoqcJE,26240,28560,all video game ips will face
AITraUoqcJE,28560,30320,getting a watered-down mobile version
AITraUoqcJE,30320,31840,that doesn't even pretend that it's not
AITraUoqcJE,31840,33200,trying to grind money out of you like
AITraUoqcJE,33200,35280,you're a nephilim rift you guys not have
AITraUoqcJE,35280,37360,phones yeah you guys
AITraUoqcJE,37360,40640,diablo immortal
AITraUoqcJE,40640,42399,welcome to the future that this random
AITraUoqcJE,42399,44640,guy in a red shirt warned us about
AITraUoqcJE,44640,47440,is this uh an out of season april fools
AITraUoqcJE,47440,49600,joke where phones are now powerful
AITraUoqcJE,49600,51520,enough to run an experience that kind of
AITraUoqcJE,51520,53680,looks like diablo iii but they still
AITraUoqcJE,53680,54960,haven't figured out the part where it
AITraUoqcJE,54960,56640,sucks ass to play
AITraUoqcJE,56640,58640,as the sliver of skill and concentration
AITraUoqcJE,58640,60719,that the pc franchise required is tossed
AITraUoqcJE,60719,61840,aside
AITraUoqcJE,61840,63840,for sliding your greasy thumbs all over
AITraUoqcJE,63840,65280,a tiny screen
AITraUoqcJE,65280,67119,auto running to the next objective while
AITraUoqcJE,67119,68960,you fall asleep on the bus
AITraUoqcJE,68960,70479,and loosely slapping your abilities
AITraUoqcJE,70479,72640,around at anything that moves
AITraUoqcJE,72640,74400,in an experience that reviewers will
AITraUoqcJE,74400,76960,call the best arpg you can play on a
AITraUoqcJE,76960,79200,phone ignoring the fact that the rest of
AITraUoqcJE,79200,80880,them feel about as fun as giving your
AITraUoqcJE,80880,83040,grandparents an oil massage not that
AITraUoqcJE,83040,84960,playing it on the pc is that much better
AITraUoqcJE,84960,86159,unless you're a fan of playing the
AITraUoqcJE,86159,88960,cookie clicker version of diablo
AITraUoqcJE,88960,90720,discover an adventure somehow more
AITraUoqcJE,90720,92640,repetitive than a normal diablo story
AITraUoqcJE,92640,93600,line
AITraUoqcJE,93600,95920,set in between the existing games when
AITraUoqcJE,95920,97600,an ancient evil has yet again been
AITraUoqcJE,97600,98960,awakened
AITraUoqcJE,98960,100880,you'll choose a champion from a team of
AITraUoqcJE,100880,103680,the exact same guys from diablo 3
AITraUoqcJE,103680,106320,using largely the same abilities and
AITraUoqcJE,106320,108240,meeting up with all the same guys from
AITraUoqcJE,108240,110960,the real game as you run around really
AITraUoqcJE,110960,113439,familiar set dressings were except for
AITraUoqcJE,113439,115600,the usual expensive maps they've been
AITraUoqcJE,115600,117520,streamlined into extremely bite-sized
AITraUoqcJE,117520,119840,chunks as you quest to find three of a
AITraUoqcJE,119840,121040,thing that you'll be guided to
AITraUoqcJE,121040,122159,immediately
AITraUoqcJE,122159,123840,to fight a boss that you'll mash attack
AITraUoqcJE,123840,126240,until it dies and watch a cutscene to
AITraUoqcJE,126240,128399,get shot to a new area to do the same
AITraUoqcJE,128399,130959,thing over again all of which combine to
AITraUoqcJE,130959,132800,remind you that you could be playing a
AITraUoqcJE,132800,135440,better version of this at all times and
AITraUoqcJE,135440,137360,make the differences feel like exactly
AITraUoqcJE,137360,138560,what it is
AITraUoqcJE,138560,140560,a mundane imitation that you're supposed
AITraUoqcJE,140560,143040,to know brain while taking a [ __ ]
AITraUoqcJE,143040,145040,take out a second mortgage to prepare
AITraUoqcJE,145040,147200,for the actually terrible part of diablo
AITraUoqcJE,147200,150560,immortal the micro transactions as the
AITraUoqcJE,150560,152400,game gives you a solid eight-ish hours
AITraUoqcJE,152400,155120,of leveling with relatively few upsells
AITraUoqcJE,155120,156959,then grinds to a halt as you run into
AITraUoqcJE,156959,159200,level limits for story quests
AITraUoqcJE,159200,161040,forcing you to grind away at the same
AITraUoqcJE,161040,163519,content over and over again
AITraUoqcJE,163519,165680,essentially stretching out 15 hours of
AITraUoqcJE,165680,169040,actual gameplay into 30. or of course
AITraUoqcJE,169040,170800,you could just fork over some cash and
AITraUoqcJE,170800,172480,make the game fun again
AITraUoqcJE,172480,174160,until you run into another gate a couple
AITraUoqcJE,174160,176400,of hours later and god forbid you get to
AITraUoqcJE,176400,178159,the end game where you'll endlessly
AITraUoqcJE,178159,180720,grind hoping for legendary gems that
AITraUoqcJE,180720,182400,will never drop for you
AITraUoqcJE,182400,184159,that you'll need to even contain in the
AITraUoqcJE,184159,186080,pay-to-win pvp mode that you'll probably
AITraUoqcJE,186080,187360,just stop playing once you get
AITraUoqcJE,187360,188800,steamrolled by a character someone
AITraUoqcJE,188800,190959,dropped a couple hundred dollars on
AITraUoqcJE,190959,193040,all accumulating to an experience that
AITraUoqcJE,193040,194800,will put off even people that initially
AITraUoqcJE,194800,197120,like this house fire of a game leaving
AITraUoqcJE,197120,198879,only saudi princes and whales that
AITraUoqcJE,198879,200480,clearly need a gambling intervention to
AITraUoqcJE,200480,203519,flex on the poor's or so you would think
AITraUoqcJE,203519,204959,in a system which technically you don't
AITraUoqcJE,204959,206640,have to pay to play if you don't plan on
AITraUoqcJE,206640,208799,doing the endgame pvp or basically
AITraUoqcJE,208799,210400,anything else that diablo at this point
AITraUoqcJE,210400,211519,is known for
AITraUoqcJE,211519,212720,you know i think the most nefarious
AITraUoqcJE,212720,214319,thing about this whole thing is the fact
AITraUoqcJE,214319,215680,that you essentially have to work for
AITraUoqcJE,215680,217760,the loot box that you paid for which at
AITraUoqcJE,217760,219120,this point you're paying less for the
AITraUoqcJE,219120,221280,items and more for the pain honestly
AITraUoqcJE,221280,223040,just pay someone to step in your balls
AITraUoqcJE,223040,225760,you'll probably save a lot more money
AITraUoqcJE,225760,228000,so clean that phone screen and get your
AITraUoqcJE,228000,229920,parents credit card ready
AITraUoqcJE,229920,231599,for a game that is a ridiculously
AITraUoqcJE,231599,233280,obscene attempt at maximizing
AITraUoqcJE,233280,235599,monetization at worst and a middling
AITraUoqcJE,235599,237840,mobile title at best in a bitter
AITraUoqcJE,237840,239680,experience that doesn't come from a lack
AITraUoqcJE,239680,241840,of technical prowess but from watching a
AITraUoqcJE,241840,243680,thing you love get processed by the same
AITraUoqcJE,243680,245200,garbage content churning machine as
AITraUoqcJE,245200,247280,everything else also if you thought the
AITraUoqcJE,247280,249120,reception for immortal was bad it'll be
AITraUoqcJE,249120,250560,a thousand times worse if any of these
AITraUoqcJE,250560,252400,systems pop up in d4
AITraUoqcJE,252400,253760,unless they had enrolling for enemy
AITraUoqcJE,253760,256000,girls or topless men then it's totally
AITraUoqcJE,256000,258000,justified
AITraUoqcJE,258000,259359,starring
AITraUoqcJE,259359,262800,sigma grindset snooz sader
AITraUoqcJE,262800,266080,renfair raver kung fu hustler
AITraUoqcJE,266080,270400,leaderboard hunter and actual cancer
AITraUoqcJE,270400,273759,diablo shadow legends
AITraUoqcJE,273759,275840,i mean come on a diamond game without
AITraUoqcJE,275840,278400,inventory management that's sacrilege
AITraUoqcJE,278400,280080,it's like making a sneaker without child
AITraUoqcJE,280080,282639,labor tell us what you'd like to hear in
AITraUoqcJE,282639,285680,my epic voice in the comments below
AITraUoqcJE,285680,288080,i'm gonna propose to my girlfriend when
AITraUoqcJE,288080,290240,we get back to base i even bought
AITraUoqcJE,290240,291759,flowers
AITraUoqcJE,291759,294240,i was eating those beans
AITraUoqcJE,294240,297680,it was dark i was in my towel when the
AITraUoqcJE,297680,299919,ninjas attacked
AITraUoqcJE,299919,301600,but behind you
AITraUoqcJE,301600,303520,no not there
AITraUoqcJE,303520,305440,in the closet
AITraUoqcJE,305440,308180,you flicked too hard damn it
