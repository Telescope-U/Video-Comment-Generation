Hz-qlYylXvY,0,3294,"Narrator: Over 160 kilograms of meat, vegetables,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,3294,5838,and rice go into this massive pan
Hz-qlYylXvY,5839,9592,to make one of the biggest paellas in Spain.
Hz-qlYylXvY,9592,11427,But this paella is just half
Hz-qlYylXvY,11428,13930,of what Vicente Mart√≠nez and his team
Hz-qlYylXvY,13930,18393,"are making for Quesa, Valencia's, Festival of the Reserve."
Hz-qlYylXvY,18393,19769,"At the end of the day,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,19769,22772,"these paellas will feed more than 1,000 people,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,22772,24481,all for free.
Hz-qlYylXvY,24482,26234,But the size of this paella
Hz-qlYylXvY,26234,28236,isn't the only thing that's special.
Hz-qlYylXvY,28236,30447,It also has a unique ingredient
Hz-qlYylXvY,30447,33575,that makes this paella distinctly Valencian.
Hz-qlYylXvY,33575,37495,"So, what does it take to make paella in such big batches?"
Hz-qlYylXvY,55096,58349,Narrator: This is known as the Festival of the Reserve.
Hz-qlYylXvY,62270,64314,"On the morning of the festival,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,64314,66733,Vicente and his crew offload and wheel
Hz-qlYylXvY,66733,70320,two 2.35-meter paella pans into the town square.
Hz-qlYylXvY,72781,75575,"When the pans are secure, they get to cooking."
Hz-qlYylXvY,90632,92008,Narrator: Each paella is cooked with
Hz-qlYylXvY,92008,94302,"8.5 liters of olive oil,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,94302,96638,"75 kilos of chicken,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,96638,99099,and 30 kilos of rabbit.
Hz-qlYylXvY,116407,118034,"Narrator: When the meat is done,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,118034,120828,"40 kilos of frozen green beans, butter beans,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,120829,123957,"and white beans are added into the mix,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,123957,126584,along with 5 kilos of snails.
Hz-qlYylXvY,149732,151860,"Narrator: Once everything is mixed together,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,151860,155363,135 liters of water are added into the pan.
Hz-qlYylXvY,179512,181806,"Narrator: After the water has been added,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,181806,184309,60 kilos of a local medium-grain rice
Hz-qlYylXvY,184309,188563,called arroz redondo is tossed into the mix.
Hz-qlYylXvY,188563,191149,Cooking with wood means that the water and fire
Hz-qlYylXvY,191149,192817,need to be constantly monitored
Hz-qlYylXvY,192817,194444,so that the rice doesn't burn.
Hz-qlYylXvY,207457,211085,"Narrator: In Spain, bomba, albufera, and redondo rice"
Hz-qlYylXvY,211085,212962,are commonly used because they can absorb
Hz-qlYylXvY,212962,215715,more liquid and flavor than regular rice
Hz-qlYylXvY,215715,217091,without getting mushy.
Hz-qlYylXvY,229979,232815,"Narrator: Paella pans often come in several diameters,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,232815,236027,"but the general shape is always wide, shallow,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,236027,238487,and round with sloping edges.
Hz-qlYylXvY,238488,239781,This shape is important
Hz-qlYylXvY,239781,242575,because it helps the rice cook evenly in a single layer.
Hz-qlYylXvY,252126,254087,Narrator: And many Spaniards agree.
Hz-qlYylXvY,266557,268768,"Narrator: While everyone enjoys paella,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,268768,271145,the exact ingredients for what constitutes
Hz-qlYylXvY,271145,274399,a true paella is still hotly debated.
Hz-qlYylXvY,281155,282865,Narrator: While the festival is full of joy
Hz-qlYylXvY,282865,284367,"and celebration today,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,284367,287161,the origins of its birth are much darker.
Hz-qlYylXvY,288121,290873,"In 1690, Quesa experienced"
Hz-qlYylXvY,290873,293543,"a devastating outbreak of the bubonic plague,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,293543,296754,which left only a few members of a single family alive.
Hz-qlYylXvY,296754,299966,"Resilient, the surviving family gave shelter and food"
Hz-qlYylXvY,299966,302260,to anyone who moved back to Quesa.
Hz-qlYylXvY,322447,324156,Narrator: Paella is thought to have come
Hz-qlYylXvY,324157,325950,from farm workers in Valencia
Hz-qlYylXvY,325950,328703,who used shallow pans to cook rice over wood fires
Hz-qlYylXvY,328703,331539,and added in ingredients they could forage or hunt
Hz-qlYylXvY,331539,334625,to create a cheap but filling one-dish lunch.
Hz-qlYylXvY,336210,337712,"Over time, the elites of Spain"
Hz-qlYylXvY,337712,340506,"started to enjoy paella for weekday lunches,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,340506,342675,and it became more popular across the country.
Hz-qlYylXvY,344093,346095,And while paella is now recognized
Hz-qlYylXvY,346095,347805,"as a traditionally Spanish dish,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,347805,349432,it wouldn't be what it is today
Hz-qlYylXvY,349432,351142,without the introduction of rice
Hz-qlYylXvY,351142,354103,by the Moors in the 12th century.
Hz-qlYylXvY,354103,355730,"Since then, paella has taken on"
Hz-qlYylXvY,355730,357940,"many iterations across Spain,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,357940,360902,"but the classic ingredients of rice, rabbit, snails,"
Hz-qlYylXvY,360902,365073,and beans remain integral for making a Valencian paella.
