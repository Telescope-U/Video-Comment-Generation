K-j7WPSknNc,62640,65040,big-headed monster exactly like the one
K-j7WPSknNc,65040,69159,described by the first dolphin
K-j7WPSknNc,70840,72880,[Music]

K-j7WPSknNc,89040,94939,[Music]
K-j7WPSknNc,99520,101119,let's see what the photos from the gup
K-j7WPSknNc,101119,103920,cans can tell us
K-j7WPSknNc,103920,106320,that's the monster i saw
K-j7WPSknNc,106320,109360,yes and that's the one i saw and that
K-j7WPSknNc,109360,112399,big whatever it is is the third monster
K-j7WPSknNc,112399,113280,hmm
K-j7WPSknNc,113280,115600,i'm not so sure there were three
K-j7WPSknNc,115600,119360,monsters let me try something
K-j7WPSknNc,123680,126880,it's a crocodile it's a salt water
K-j7WPSknNc,126880,130160,crocodile the world's largest crocodile
K-j7WPSknNc,130160,132480,it's as big as a bus
K-j7WPSknNc,132480,135760,and it's a long way from home saltwater
K-j7WPSknNc,135760,137840,crocodiles normally live in places like
K-j7WPSknNc,137840,140800,australia that's over a thousand miles
K-j7WPSknNc,140800,144239,away hmm it's not unusual for saltwater
K-j7WPSknNc,144239,146239,crocodiles to travel far out to sea
K-j7WPSknNc,146239,148319,looking for food but i've never heard of
K-j7WPSknNc,148319,151519,one spotted in the antarctic ocean oh no
K-j7WPSknNc,151519,155040,he must be lost and freezing saltwater
K-j7WPSknNc,155040,157200,crocodiles are reptiles they stay
K-j7WPSknNc,157200,159040,healthy by moving to different places
K-j7WPSknNc,159040,162160,when they need to warm up or cool down
K-j7WPSknNc,162160,164319,if they get too hot they move to a
K-j7WPSknNc,164319,167280,cooler place and if they get too cold
K-j7WPSknNc,167280,169760,they move to a warmer place but here in
K-j7WPSknNc,169760,171680,the antarctic there's no place he can go
K-j7WPSknNc,171680,173920,to warm up he won't be able to survive
K-j7WPSknNc,173920,176560,this extreme cold for long dashi sound
K-j7WPSknNc,176560,178879,the octo alert
K-j7WPSknNc,178879,183480,octonauts to the launch bay
K-j7WPSknNc,183910,189680,[Music]
K-j7WPSknNc,189680,192480,octonauts we have a saltwater crocodile
K-j7WPSknNc,192480,194720,who is lost and in danger from the icy
K-j7WPSknNc,194720,197360,cold water our mission is to find him
K-j7WPSknNc,197360,200750,and take him home quasi peso to the guts
K-j7WPSknNc,200750,203519,[Music]
K-j7WPSknNc,203519,205519,remember octonauts this is a huge
K-j7WPSknNc,205519,207599,creature we're looking for if it feels
K-j7WPSknNc,207599,210400,threatened or scared it may attack us
K-j7WPSknNc,210400,213040,aye and the way it nearly swatted me up
K-j7WPSknNc,213040,215519,that tail could crush us like a tin can
K-j7WPSknNc,215519,217280,it would more likely chomp you with its
K-j7WPSknNc,217280,219760,massive jaws and teeth
K-j7WPSknNc,219760,222319,keep a sharp lookout me hearties that
K-j7WPSknNc,222319,225120,croc could be lurking anywhere below us

K-j7WPSknNc,270479,273360,crocodiles get very cold their bodies
K-j7WPSknNc,273360,276160,can slow down and go into a kind of
K-j7WPSknNc,276160,278560,sleep where they don't need to eat or
K-j7WPSknNc,278560,282400,breathe air for a long time so he'll be
K-j7WPSknNc,282400,285440,fine after he wakes up he'll head home
K-j7WPSknNc,285440,287520,the saltwater crocodile might not know
K-j7WPSknNc,287520,289840,his way home quasi and he may not be
K-j7WPSknNc,289840,291520,able to wake up at all because of the
K-j7WPSknNc,291520,293919,extreme cold we need to get him back to
