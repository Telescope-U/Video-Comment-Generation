1weSZQGGs2k,3280,5359,almost two years ago i made the bubble
1weSZQGGs2k,5359,7440,rock fountain bowl that was a pretty
1weSZQGGs2k,7440,9040,cool project
1weSZQGGs2k,9040,10960,it has since been decommissioned and
1weSZQGGs2k,10960,14759,left to collect dust
1weSZQGGs2k,27439,29439,for that build to work properly i had to
1weSZQGGs2k,29439,31279,drill a hole in the bottom
1weSZQGGs2k,31279,32960,moving forward to present day that
1weSZQGGs2k,32960,34880,feature must be reversed
1weSZQGGs2k,34880,36880,the bowl is made from glass so i'll
1weSZQGGs2k,36880,39280,patch it up with the same
1weSZQGGs2k,39280,41120,i took measurements to determine what
1weSZQGGs2k,41120,43440,glass to use and to create a guide for
1weSZQGGs2k,43440,44960,the hole saw
1weSZQGGs2k,44960,46719,a little hot glue allowed me to create a
1weSZQGGs2k,46719,49520,gasket of sorts between the pieces
1weSZQGGs2k,49520,51280,this will help retain the water which
1weSZQGGs2k,51280,55200,keeps the hole saw from overheating
1weSZQGGs2k,55200,58459,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,59039,61199,a spring clamp will keep it stationary
1weSZQGGs2k,61199,63530,while i drill
1weSZQGGs2k,63530,66560,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,66720,69520,as usual i'm not applying any pressure
1weSZQGGs2k,69520,71360,the weight of the toe itself is doing
1weSZQGGs2k,71360,73750,the work
1weSZQGGs2k,73750,76720,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,76720,79040,the newly created glass puck combined
1weSZQGGs2k,79040,80799,with a ring of silicone will plug the
1weSZQGGs2k,80799,84200,hole with ease
1weSZQGGs2k,84660,87119,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,87119,88640,it's just a hair smaller than the
1weSZQGGs2k,88640,90880,diameter of the hole so the pieces fit
1weSZQGGs2k,90880,94000,together perfectly
1weSZQGGs2k,94120,95520,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,95520,97280,it's not quite as thick though so i
1weSZQGGs2k,97280,99040,applied additional silicone to the
1weSZQGGs2k,99040,100650,interior
1weSZQGGs2k,100650,116580,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,121180,124289,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,130959,133040,here's the patched up vessel for
1weSZQGGs2k,133040,134640,reference it can hold up to three and a
1weSZQGGs2k,134640,138080,half gallons or 13 liters
1weSZQGGs2k,138080,140000,my goal is to transform this into a
1weSZQGGs2k,140000,142480,low-tech riparian bowl using simple
1weSZQGGs2k,142480,143760,techniques
1weSZQGGs2k,143760,145520,after going through a few ideas
1weSZQGGs2k,145520,147440,utilizing driftwood seemed like the way
1weSZQGGs2k,147440,149520,to go i have a nice selection of
1weSZQGGs2k,149520,151040,spiderwood which will allow me to
1weSZQGGs2k,151040,155079,achieve the desired function
1weSZQGGs2k,156510,163939,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,164560,166640,as i'm escaping the main feature i want
1weSZQGGs2k,166640,169200,to create is a shelf of sorts this will
1weSZQGGs2k,169200,171040,be a few inches below the top of the
1weSZQGGs2k,171040,172239,container
1weSZQGGs2k,172239,174000,here i'll use the features of the wood
1weSZQGGs2k,174000,176319,to hold various plants above the water
1weSZQGGs2k,176319,178720,more on that later for now a syngonion
1weSZQGGs2k,178720,180239,will help me determine if this
1weSZQGGs2k,180239,183120,configuration is viable
1weSZQGGs2k,183120,184959,i thought it was going to work but i had
1weSZQGGs2k,184959,186720,to make an adjustment
1weSZQGGs2k,186720,188640,i moved the smaller piece to the bottom
1weSZQGGs2k,188640,191599,of the container
1weSZQGGs2k,193360,195360,now this is going to work perfectly for
1weSZQGGs2k,195360,197920,what i have in mind very simple yet
1weSZQGGs2k,197920,200560,effective
1weSZQGGs2k,201040,203200,as you know substrate is always a big
1weSZQGGs2k,203200,204720,consideration
1weSZQGGs2k,204720,206640,this build is unique because the plants
1weSZQGGs2k,206640,209360,will begin in a hydroponic environment
1weSZQGGs2k,209360,211120,in other words they'll grow without a
1weSZQGGs2k,211120,213360,substrate and obtain nutrients from the
1weSZQGGs2k,213360,214799,water itself
1weSZQGGs2k,214799,216560,however the roots will eventually make
1weSZQGGs2k,216560,218239,it down to the bottom where they can
1weSZQGGs2k,218239,221360,take advantage of an enriched aqua soil
1weSZQGGs2k,221360,223360,i'll include it because of this and to
1weSZQGGs2k,223360,225760,buffer the water it doesn't look great
1weSZQGGs2k,225760,228480,on its own though i'll add fine gravel
1weSZQGGs2k,228480,232560,which is nearly the same grain size
1weSZQGGs2k,235439,237519,i figured coarse sand would make it look
1weSZQGGs2k,237519,241080,even more cohesive
1weSZQGGs2k,244000,245760,in my opinion the result is something
1weSZQGGs2k,245760,248480,cohesive and practical
1weSZQGGs2k,248480,250480,with a build like this it's probably
1weSZQGGs2k,250480,253200,best to include a thick layer after all
1weSZQGGs2k,253200,254720,this is where the vast majority of
1weSZQGGs2k,254720,257070,beneficial bacteria will reside
1weSZQGGs2k,257070,261889,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,264639,266479,normally i wouldn't add the lighting yet
1weSZQGGs2k,266479,268320,but it will be easier to plant if i do
1weSZQGGs2k,268320,270720,it now
1weSZQGGs2k,271040,273520,i selected this mini led light which is
1weSZQGGs2k,273520,276080,attached to a bamboo tray it seemed like
1weSZQGGs2k,276080,278240,the perfect option given the nature of
1weSZQGGs2k,278240,280720,the build
1weSZQGGs2k,281120,282639,planting this should be fairly
1weSZQGGs2k,282639,285040,straightforward i've selected an array
1weSZQGGs2k,285040,286800,of plants which will grow well in a
1weSZQGGs2k,286800,289440,riparian setting meaning their roots are
1weSZQGGs2k,289440,291360,immersed in water while the rest of the
1weSZQGGs2k,291360,293680,plant is above the rim anyway i
1weSZQGGs2k,293680,295600,processed these ahead of time like i've
1weSZQGGs2k,295600,298400,shown before
1weSZQGGs2k,298400,300560,i simply rinse away all of the substrate
1weSZQGGs2k,300560,303840,and clean the foliage
1weSZQGGs2k,304160,306080,as long as you're gentle the result is
1weSZQGGs2k,306080,308720,clean plants that are ready to go that
1weSZQGGs2k,308720,310720,said it doesn't hurt to be more thorough
1weSZQGGs2k,310720,312880,and run the plants through quarantine
1weSZQGGs2k,312880,314720,this process is usually sufficient
1weSZQGGs2k,314720,317039,though
1weSZQGGs2k,317039,319120,one of my favorite steps is always
1weSZQGGs2k,319120,321520,adding the plants they really just bring
1weSZQGGs2k,321520,323280,it all together
1weSZQGGs2k,323280,325280,as i work i typically start with the
1weSZQGGs2k,325280,328000,large plants like the syngonium this
1weSZQGGs2k,328000,330160,makes it easier to maintain cohesive
1weSZQGGs2k,330160,333039,textures and scale
1weSZQGGs2k,333039,335039,in this instance i nestled the plant
1weSZQGGs2k,335039,337039,atop the driftwood and re-worked the
1weSZQGGs2k,337039,338479,roots as i went
1weSZQGGs2k,338479,340240,this was challenging to get right
1weSZQGGs2k,340240,343600,without using additional elements
1weSZQGGs2k,343600,345680,i didn't expect it but i was able to
1weSZQGGs2k,345680,347600,immediately nestle some of the roots in
1weSZQGGs2k,347600,349039,the substrate
1weSZQGGs2k,349039,353160,this helped keep them steady
1weSZQGGs2k,354080,357319,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,360080,361680,the remainder of the plants were much
1weSZQGGs2k,361680,365400,easier to include
1weSZQGGs2k,370130,373440,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,373440,375840,as i added them i adjusted the roots to
1weSZQGGs2k,375840,378000,help keep things anchored
1weSZQGGs2k,378000,379759,the cool thing about this is that the
1weSZQGGs2k,379759,381840,plants will become more secure as the
1weSZQGGs2k,381840,384639,roots mature
1weSZQGGs2k,388720,390720,while i did all of this though i had to
1weSZQGGs2k,390720,392639,keep in mind where the plants were not
1weSZQGGs2k,392639,394960,only from a stability perspective but
1weSZQGGs2k,394960,396800,also to maximize the amount of light
1weSZQGGs2k,396800,398960,going down into the bowl
1weSZQGGs2k,398960,401120,as you saw before it was also a little
1weSZQGGs2k,401120,403120,tedious to find areas where the plants
1weSZQGGs2k,403120,406280,could reside
1weSZQGGs2k,408800,411210,so
1weSZQGGs2k,411210,420789,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,424790,430160,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,430160,432479,i decided that the setup would look and
1weSZQGGs2k,432479,435360,function better with botanicals i boiled
1weSZQGGs2k,435360,438479,them first so they sink immediately
1weSZQGGs2k,438479,440720,these will help naturalize the setup and
1weSZQGGs2k,440720,442240,provide climbing areas for the
1weSZQGGs2k,442240,445440,inhabitants to graze on
1weSZQGGs2k,445440,447599,amazon frog bit seemed like another
1weSZQGGs2k,447599,448840,great
1weSZQGGs2k,448840,451199,inclusion they have really long roots
1weSZQGGs2k,451199,452880,which will play into the theme of this
1weSZQGGs2k,452880,454570,build
1weSZQGGs2k,454570,461680,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,461680,463759,with all of these elements in place i'm
1weSZQGGs2k,463759,466000,very pleased with the result
1weSZQGGs2k,466000,468080,obviously this looks neat but it's also
1weSZQGGs2k,468080,470479,a very low maintenance solution that's
1weSZQGGs2k,470479,472479,due to the power of plants
1weSZQGGs2k,472479,474319,the roots will suck nutrients from the
1weSZQGGs2k,474319,476240,water in order to grow
1weSZQGGs2k,476240,478000,this creates a clean and stable
1weSZQGGs2k,478000,480160,environment which essentially sustains
1weSZQGGs2k,480160,482479,itself i can't wait to see how it
1weSZQGGs2k,482479,485120,progresses
1weSZQGGs2k,485120,487590,let's add the inhabitants
1weSZQGGs2k,487590,507079,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,511120,514080,these are true aquatic nano species the
1weSZQGGs2k,514080,516240,thai micro crab
1weSZQGGs2k,516240,518320,they're super tiny and won't grow much
1weSZQGGs2k,518320,520320,bigger than this so they're perfect for
1weSZQGGs2k,520320,522000,a mini setup
1weSZQGGs2k,522000,524240,they enjoy climbing on and living in
1weSZQGGs2k,524240,526000,roots which is why i made this setup
1weSZQGGs2k,526000,527519,like i did
1weSZQGGs2k,527519,529839,also unlike many other aquatic crabs
1weSZQGGs2k,529839,531600,these ones have no interest on leafing
1weSZQGGs2k,531600,532839,this
1weSZQGGs2k,532839,535279,system so in making a low maintenance
1weSZQGGs2k,535279,537839,riparian build you can simultaneously
1weSZQGGs2k,537839,541519,give them exactly what they want
1weSZQGGs2k,542080,544000,i don't know about you but i really like
1weSZQGGs2k,544000,546000,this style of setup
1weSZQGGs2k,546000,548000,the roots create a neat vibe and the
1weSZQGGs2k,548000,549839,crabs are a cool little critter to have
1weSZQGGs2k,549839,551970,around
1weSZQGGs2k,551970,553440,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,553440,555200,what do you think let me know down in
1weSZQGGs2k,555200,556880,the comments
1weSZQGGs2k,556880,559120,also if you enjoyed this check out the
1weSZQGGs2k,559120,561360,video description i've linked up some
1weSZQGGs2k,561360,563680,similar builds that i know you'll love
1weSZQGGs2k,563680,565839,anyway that's all for now i hope you all
1weSZQGGs2k,565839,567760,enjoyed the video and learned something
1weSZQGGs2k,567760,570320,new until next time surprise squad take
1weSZQGGs2k,570320,574279,care and peace
1weSZQGGs2k,577550,590929,[Music]
1weSZQGGs2k,591680,593760,you
