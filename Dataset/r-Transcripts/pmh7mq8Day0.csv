pmh7mq8Day0,2320,4319,to open the game as we did in games one
pmh7mq8Day0,4319,6799,and two but clearly john cooper looking
pmh7mq8Day0,6799,8480,for a different start tonight yeah and a
pmh7mq8Day0,8480,10160,very different look as we mentioned with
pmh7mq8Day0,10160,12080,braden point out he's without one of
pmh7mq8Day0,12080,14160,their top guys as he has been for so
pmh7mq8Day0,14160,18320,long they need a little spark here early
pmh7mq8Day0,18400,20720,so jt comfort on this offensive zone
pmh7mq8Day0,20720,23039,face-off against paul
pmh7mq8Day0,23039,25920,and wins it back to the line for macar
pmh7mq8Day0,25920,30560,he's shot director oh it didn't go in
pmh7mq8Day0,33600,36079,he's been razor sharp at home this one
pmh7mq8Day0,36079,37920,deflects twice he gets not only the
pmh7mq8Day0,37920,40559,first save off of the hedman deflection
pmh7mq8Day0,40559,42719,gets it with his toe watch the reaction
pmh7mq8Day0,42719,44879,as coffer tries to slide that one back
pmh7mq8Day0,44879,47520,as vasilevskiy moves so quickly
pmh7mq8Day0,47520,49520,laterally just a little push off there
pmh7mq8Day0,49520,51680,well you know that angle it does look
pmh7mq8Day0,51680,53440,like there's a little bit of white but
pmh7mq8Day0,53440,55520,the one from
pmh7mq8Day0,55520,57440,the higher up was a little bit difficult
pmh7mq8Day0,57440,60079,to tell upon further video review it was
pmh7mq8Day0,60079,62200,determined the play was offside
pmh7mq8Day0,62200,66960,[Applause]
pmh7mq8Day0,66960,69280,now mckinnon just tapped it past the car
pmh7mq8Day0,69280,71520,and they have to recalibrate out at
pmh7mq8Day0,71520,72560,center
pmh7mq8Day0,72560,74720,mckinnon way back into his own zone to
pmh7mq8Day0,74720,76240,wind it up
pmh7mq8Day0,76240,78479,haven't seen the flashes of speed from
pmh7mq8Day0,78479,80400,the avalanche so far
pmh7mq8Day0,80400,82799,here in game number three makara cross
pmh7mq8Day0,82799,86960,good spot branson and right off
pmh7mq8Day0,86960,88799,was on the doorstep

pmh7mq8Day0,96479,98799,lannister coming in there's one
pmh7mq8Day0,98799,101600,crosstalk there's
pmh7mq8Day0,101600,104640,the contact between vasilevskiy but that
pmh7mq8Day0,104640,106720,shot again going through you've seen in
pmh7mq8Day0,106720,109040,this series and if you go back to game
pmh7mq8Day0,109040,110720,one the first goal
pmh7mq8Day0,110720,111520,of
pmh7mq8Day0,111520,113840,the stanley cup final was through
pmh7mq8Day0,113840,115840,vasilevskiy and it was landiscog who
pmh7mq8Day0,115840,118320,poked it in that one hit off landisgog
pmh7mq8Day0,118320,120479,and then he's able to grab it when does
pmh7mq8Day0,120479,122960,the contact come
pmh7mq8Day0,122960,124799,there's james with a lot of room he'll
pmh7mq8Day0,124799,127280,wind and fire right on as the lightning
pmh7mq8Day0,127280,128959,reflects a change at the end of the
pmh7mq8Day0,128959,130160,power play
pmh7mq8Day0,130160,132720,but now it's cirelli dashing back new
pmh7mq8Day0,132720,135280,hook has returned to the ice anthony to
pmh7mq8Day0,135280,138680,the net scores

pmh7mq8Day0,155519,156400,playback
pmh7mq8Day0,156400,158319,from his skate to a stick and he tries
pmh7mq8Day0,158319,160720,to pull it and actually misses it so the
pmh7mq8Day0,160720,162800,reef with temper is it's coming across
pmh7mq8Day0,162800,164879,his crease and right here at the last
pmh7mq8Day0,164879,167440,second he loses control as he's coming
pmh7mq8Day0,167440,170160,across with back pressure kemper opens
pmh7mq8Day0,170160,172400,up thinking it's coming tries to get his
pmh7mq8Day0,172400,174160,stick in the way and that one goes right
pmh7mq8Day0,174160,176319,as he loses it there right in the five
pmh7mq8Day0,176319,177360,hole and
pmh7mq8Day0,177360,180080,mccarter now with 25 points 23 for

pmh7mq8Day0,206239,208640,backside
pmh7mq8Day0,208640,210400,kale in the car you give up the blue
pmh7mq8Day0,210400,211920,line easily a little bit of a
pmh7mq8Day0,211920,213599,criss-crossing getting lost on the
pmh7mq8Day0,213599,216080,outside there's a read by ramsen and he
pmh7mq8Day0,216080,218799,got puck watching as palant drops it his
pmh7mq8Day0,218799,221360,responsibility is to stay with paulo

pmh7mq8Day0,256560,258479,reaction by him look at he could barely
pmh7mq8Day0,258479,260639,ski that looks like a men's league
pmh7mq8Day0,260639,262639,player coming into the slot but not the
pmh7mq8Day0,262639,264960,shot what a quick release how about the
pmh7mq8Day0,264960,266960,play before by mcdonough with his stick
pmh7mq8Day0,266960,269520,stopping that cross crease pass
pmh7mq8Day0,269520,273040,two great defensive plays by number 27.

pmh7mq8Day0,289600,291840,where mckinnon is on the point we saw
pmh7mq8Day0,291840,293680,the great shot earlier
pmh7mq8Day0,293680,295680,by mccarran i don't think vasilevskiy
pmh7mq8Day0,295680,298400,was expecting from that range landa
pmh7mq8Day0,298400,300000,scott to make this shot a couple of
pmh7mq8Day0,300000,302080,looks he's got the inside with lekken in
pmh7mq8Day0,302080,303840,and right through the screen of chernak
pmh7mq8Day0,303840,305600,what a great view that was
pmh7mq8Day0,305600,307680,landistog with his head up gets it right
pmh7mq8Day0,307680,308840,to
pmh7mq8Day0,308840,309280,area again stamkos looks to give it back
pmh7mq8Day0,309280,309919,here an
pmh7mq8Day0,312720,314639,and it bounced through
pmh7mq8Day0,314639,317919,steered away by kipper centered against

pmh7mq8Day0,335120,337120,a pass and sending it down into the
pmh7mq8Day0,337120,338720,lightning zone you know vasilevskiy
pmh7mq8Day0,338720,340479,didn't give the tap tap tap because it
pmh7mq8Day0,340479,342160,wasn't a power play he wasn't thinking
pmh7mq8Day0,342160,344080,that almost was costly there not knowing

pmh7mq8Day0,397199,401560,top what a deflection by foreign
pmh7mq8Day0,403039,405039,off the post and then on the doorstep

pmh7mq8Day0,421280,424800,a definite size mismatch but cochlear is
pmh7mq8Day0,424800,426319,not going to back down
pmh7mq8Day0,426319,428800,the last scrum you remember cogliana was

pmh7mq8Day0,431680,433440,here he absorbed the hit and he'd had
