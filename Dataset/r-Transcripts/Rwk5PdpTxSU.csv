Rwk5PdpTxSU,3500,4820,"Whilst the world waits,"
Rwk5PdpTxSU,8620,9840,Let’s remember...
Rwk5PdpTxSU,14100,15620,We will run again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,18880,21039,We will freeze in the stands again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,23260,25800,And sprint‐and sweat‐and fly
Rwk5PdpTxSU,28080,30480,And still be late for practice again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,31560,33340,We'll meet on the mat‐again
Rwk5PdpTxSU,35120,37399,And be spellbound by legends
Rwk5PdpTxSU,40460,42120,We’ll witness the haka again
Rwk5PdpTxSU,42260,43600,And be grateful...
Rwk5PdpTxSU,45640,47460,We’ll watch dame do dame again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,50360,52920,We’ll BQ and turn onto boylston again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,55760,57199,We’ll compete again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,57900,59100,And create again.
Rwk5PdpTxSU,62100,63840,"And when the time comes,"
Rwk5PdpTxSU,67460,68760,We will be ready.
