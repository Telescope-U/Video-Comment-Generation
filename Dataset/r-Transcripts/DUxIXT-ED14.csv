DUxIXT-ED14,880,2720,i've discovered one problem which i've
DUxIXT-ED14,2720,5839,been talking about
DUxIXT-ED14,5839,8240,but not insisting because that's my way
DUxIXT-ED14,8240,9280,of working
DUxIXT-ED14,9280,12080,i don't want to force people to
DUxIXT-ED14,12080,14080,do what i think
DUxIXT-ED14,14080,17920,i would rather persuade them
DUxIXT-ED14,22000,24080,the other just the other day we were in
DUxIXT-ED14,24080,26560,morocco
DUxIXT-ED14,26880,29599,and we were looking at the
DUxIXT-ED14,29599,32960,u-boss figures
DUxIXT-ED14,34719,39280,the primary seven completion rate
DUxIXT-ED14,39760,42399,in the whole of uganda apparently is
DUxIXT-ED14,42399,45839,38 percent
DUxIXT-ED14,46719,49039,the children
DUxIXT-ED14,49039,52480,who go into the primary school
DUxIXT-ED14,53520,57120,and finish p7
DUxIXT-ED14,57120,60320,are always at the eighth
DUxIXT-ED14,60320,63359,out of 100
DUxIXT-ED14,64158,66479,which means
DUxIXT-ED14,66479,69600,that 62
DUxIXT-ED14,69680,71360,go back to the village they don't finish
DUxIXT-ED14,71360,73840,p7
DUxIXT-ED14,74960,77840,and in the case of karamoja
DUxIXT-ED14,77840,79759,we found it was only six
DUxIXT-ED14,79759,80960,children
DUxIXT-ED14,80960,85720,out of 100 who finished primary civil
DUxIXT-ED14,87200,89280,and you remember during the elections i
DUxIXT-ED14,89280,92240,was talking about it
DUxIXT-ED14,92560,95600,because when we introduced upe in 1997
DUxIXT-ED14,95600,96960,the idea was
DUxIXT-ED14,96960,99200,everybody to go to school universal
DUxIXT-ED14,99200,101840,education
DUxIXT-ED14,103680,107600,universal primary school education
DUxIXT-ED14,108560,110960,and the reason why
DUxIXT-ED14,110960,112799,these children drop out is because of
DUxIXT-ED14,112799,114720,the school charges i've been telling you
DUxIXT-ED14,114720,119200,about this so many times begging talking
DUxIXT-ED14,119680,121360,as if i want people to come and work on
DUxIXT-ED14,121360,125360,my farm or do my me a favor
DUxIXT-ED14,127119,130479,now this is a big problem
DUxIXT-ED14,130479,133280,for the country
DUxIXT-ED14,133280,135680,to find that children
DUxIXT-ED14,135680,137120,and you can see it in the in the
DUxIXT-ED14,137120,140640,elections i was talking about it
DUxIXT-ED14,140640,143120,in the primary school
DUxIXT-ED14,143120,145360,the enrollment is 10 million something
DUxIXT-ED14,145360,148560,10 point something almost 11.
DUxIXT-ED14,148560,150720,but in the secondary schools only 2
DUxIXT-ED14,150720,153200,million
DUxIXT-ED14,153360,157319,where have the other 8 gone
DUxIXT-ED14,158640,160480,of course in the 10 million it did not
DUxIXT-ED14,160480,162400,come out so that many of them drop out
DUxIXT-ED14,162400,164400,of course many of them will drop out
DUxIXT-ED14,164400,167120,they don't go to the secondary school
DUxIXT-ED14,167120,168720,so there are four
DUxIXT-ED14,168720,171760,i i call on the political class
DUxIXT-ED14,171760,175120,especially the nrm people
DUxIXT-ED14,175120,177440,to say no
DUxIXT-ED14,177440,180800,we must budget for
DUxIXT-ED14,181200,185840,free and even even compulsory
DUxIXT-ED14,186319,189840,primary school education
DUxIXT-ED14,191360,193680,we budget for it and we stop these
DUxIXT-ED14,193680,195680,teachers greeted for money collecting
DUxIXT-ED14,195680,198560,money from these children
DUxIXT-ED14,198560,200239,in government schools this is what i
DUxIXT-ED14,200239,202000,wanted from the beginning but i can't do
DUxIXT-ED14,202000,203440,it alone
DUxIXT-ED14,203440,206879,uganda doesn't belong to me
DUxIXT-ED14,207200,209680,from 1997 this was my
DUxIXT-ED14,209680,211760,my wish
DUxIXT-ED14,211760,214000,when we introduced upe the idea was
DUxIXT-ED14,214000,215920,everybody should finish secondary
DUxIXT-ED14,215920,218400,education
DUxIXT-ED14,218400,219920,so we should not be talking of two
DUxIXT-ED14,219920,221360,million children in the secondary school
DUxIXT-ED14,221360,223920,we should be talking of 10 million
DUxIXT-ED14,223920,225280,in the secondary school because
DUxIXT-ED14,225280,227360,secondary school years are
DUxIXT-ED14,227360,229599,s1 to s6
DUxIXT-ED14,229599,231360,six years
DUxIXT-ED14,231360,236159,they're almost the same as p1 to p7
DUxIXT-ED14,236159,238239,so why should you have 10 million almost
DUxIXT-ED14,238239,240799,11 million in primary and only 2 million
DUxIXT-ED14,240799,240970,in
DUxIXT-ED14,240970,243120,[Music]
DUxIXT-ED14,243120,246799,in a second where have the others gone
DUxIXT-ED14,247120,249040,so we may not do it this year because
DUxIXT-ED14,249040,250879,this budget is now finished but in the
DUxIXT-ED14,250879,252959,next financial
DUxIXT-ED14,252959,255680,one or two financial years
DUxIXT-ED14,255680,258880,we should really work and
DUxIXT-ED14,259280,260400,insist
DUxIXT-ED14,260400,263680,on free and compulsory
DUxIXT-ED14,263680,266160,primary
DUxIXT-ED14,266160,270400,maybe even with secondary education
DUxIXT-ED14,271600,274960,and stop all these
DUxIXT-ED14,275040,277680,pharaohs who are looking for money
DUxIXT-ED14,277680,279759,through education go to get out go in
DUxIXT-ED14,279759,281680,the primary school private schools and
DUxIXT-ED14,281680,284080,look for money there
DUxIXT-ED14,284080,287120,nothing the government wants
DUxIXT-ED14,287120,289440,disgusting
DUxIXT-ED14,289440,290880,sending children out of school because
DUxIXT-ED14,290880,292639,we are looking for money for houses for
DUxIXT-ED14,292639,293919,what
DUxIXT-ED14,293919,297479,it's really disgusting
