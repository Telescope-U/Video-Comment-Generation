kpMYEBSOcEU,1739039,1745360,lee benson from kwtv in oklahoma city  okay the ending where you guys took the  lead i
kpMYEBSOcEU,1745360,1751120,i know you  you guys stranded the bases loaded it  seemed like the momentum might have been  going back towards ole miss but the next
kpMYEBSOcEU,1751120,1758320,frame you struck out the side did it  seem to you like the crowd was pretty  one-sided again coming out there and
kpMYEBSOcEU,1758320,1765039,getting those strikeouts again what was  that like for you in that moment yeah i  knew once we we stranded those
kpMYEBSOcEU,1765039,1772000,the base is loaded i we needed to take  the momentum back  um i had that going through my head and  so i just wanted to go out there
kpMYEBSOcEU,1772000,1777440,and continue  to make good pitches and and execute
kpMYEBSOcEU,1777440,1783360,okay  eric eric bailly with the tulsa world  kade there was a lot of 2010 players
kpMYEBSOcEU,1783360,1789120,former ou players came to omaha and i  just want to ask you to reflect on this  locker room and the friendships you made
kpMYEBSOcEU,1789120,1797120,and just the journey you guys have had  this year coming to where how far you  came  yeah i mean this team is second to none
kpMYEBSOcEU,1797120,1803919,um i'll remember these guys for the rest  of my life  um  it's a close knit group in there and
kpMYEBSOcEU,1803919,1810640,um there's there's a lot of young guys  and and then there's you know  um like tanner trent
kpMYEBSOcEU,1810640,1816480,jarrett uh carmichael ben all those guys  that have been around for a while
kpMYEBSOcEU,1816480,1823200,and you know it sucks seeing this is you  know one of their last games in in the  uniform
kpMYEBSOcEU,1823200,1828320,okay right here  uh john hoover all sooners kade um you
kpMYEBSOcEU,1828320,1833520,mentioned one pitch at a time it  probably is harder to do than what the  way you explained it
kpMYEBSOcEU,1833520,1840159,you know keeping your heart rate down  keeping your breathing down  when you're out there and the tension of  the game is mounting and your strike up
kpMYEBSOcEU,1840159,1845760,the strikeouts are mounting as well how  did you do that how did you keep  yourself calm in the moment um just
kpMYEBSOcEU,1845760,1851919,stick with my routines  you know just  make sure take a deep breath every time
kpMYEBSOcEU,1851919,1857120,before i deliver the pitch and then  you know if if i didn't like the pitch  or
kpMYEBSOcEU,1857120,1863840,if if  say i got  i thought it was a strike and it got  called a ball you know step off the mall
kpMYEBSOcEU,1863840,1869440,and take a deep breath and lock back in  okay we have a question on zoom please
kpMYEBSOcEU,1869440,1875360,state your name and affiliation please  and the question  yeah jenny carlson with the oklahoman
kpMYEBSOcEU,1875360,1880720,hey kade i know you guys have said that  this was always the plan to win a  national championship to play for
kpMYEBSOcEU,1880720,1887919,national championship and yet to think  how far you guys came from you know  mid-season to to now to really get the
kpMYEBSOcEU,1887919,1894960,results and the wins to get here how do  you reflect on that and how do you how  do you explain how you guys turned such
kpMYEBSOcEU,1894960,1901120,a hard corner to to make the  championship series  yeah i mean you know we've been doubted
kpMYEBSOcEU,1901120,1906559,all year  uh  you know  we we were picked to
kpMYEBSOcEU,1906559,1912159,finish six in the in the big 12.  and you know i think when looking back
kpMYEBSOcEU,1912159,1917200,at the beginning of the year we we  didn't know how to win yet  um and that's something our team figured
kpMYEBSOcEU,1917200,1924399,out and we went through  struggles with that at the series  against texas and oklahoma state
kpMYEBSOcEU,1924399,1929760,and then  we we kind of learned and got through  that learned how to win started
kpMYEBSOcEU,1929760,1938480,believing in each other  and it kind of just took off from there  and set a good clear path for us
kpMYEBSOcEU,1938480,1944480,that'll be it for cade thank you  congratulations on a great season and a  great tournament thank you guys thank
kpMYEBSOcEU,1944480,1951760,you  thank you eric
kpMYEBSOcEU,1954159,1960960,okay questions for skip now  we'll start here with eddie  eddie radasovich centerscoop.com just
kpMYEBSOcEU,1960960,1966799,what was the interpretation of the rule  in the sixth inning on the interference  was that just a straight interference i
kpMYEBSOcEU,1966799,1974240,guess  yeah i mean i uh  running the runner's lane  that's maybe what the call was uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,1974240,1980320,and uh  and they have to go back to the other  bases because it kills it right there i  think the biggest thing that i want to
kpMYEBSOcEU,1980320,1986640,explain to that deal is the umpires are  gonna if if we if we take out the human  element of the umpires this game's not
kpMYEBSOcEU,1986640,1993200,ever gonna be any good  if we continue to do those things and  put a computer or whatever they want to
kpMYEBSOcEU,1993200,1999200,do it's going to continue to be good the  rule says that you have to do it within  30 seconds and not be able to look at
kpMYEBSOcEU,1999200,2005200,the video board that's what the rule  says and uh maybe there's some  discrepancy of it but that's what i also
kpMYEBSOcEU,2005200,2011120,love about the game is the human element  i have  tons of respect for the umpires i mean
kpMYEBSOcEU,2011120,2017600,going back to the regional tournament  never understood why  they couldn't be out there with a  national anthem when everybody else is
kpMYEBSOcEU,2017600,2024000,because it's very important to our  country and i explained that to them too  so that's the interpretation of the rule
kpMYEBSOcEU,2024000,2031440,they have a runner's lane there and  if we mess with the fabric of the game  by getting computer umpires i think i'll
kpMYEBSOcEU,2031440,2036880,just go fishing  okay right here  target monstery norman transcript
kpMYEBSOcEU,2036880,2042640,uh yeah after the run got taken off the  board they came back with the solo home  run
kpMYEBSOcEU,2042640,2049118,what does it mean to see your team come  back and get those two runs in the  seventh and respond on this stage well i
kpMYEBSOcEU,2049118,2055118,mean they're gonna fight that's one  thing that they've done all year long  they fought and they fought and they  fought and they've battled in battle and
kpMYEBSOcEU,2055118,2060320,battle that's a part of their dna and  that's about part of what the university  of oklahoma has taught them how to do it
kpMYEBSOcEU,2060320,2066240,and our culture has taught them how to  do it and really proud of those guys the  funny thing is about baseball it doesn't
kpMYEBSOcEU,2066240,2071440,carry how you feel  it doesn't and that's what's great about  it too and so
kpMYEBSOcEU,2071440,2077358,that's the learning lesson in it and  continue to fight and understand the  details of the game and fight for what's
kpMYEBSOcEU,2077358,2084398,right in the game and and play as hard  as you can because it respects you  get back over here
kpMYEBSOcEU,2084398,2089440,justin martinez the oklahoman skip  chairman michael someone who's been a  rock for you the whole season especially
kpMYEBSOcEU,2089440,2094960,in the postseason just what was your  message to him after the game today  that i loved him
kpMYEBSOcEU,2094960,2099599,and i wouldn't want to have anybody else  out there
kpMYEBSOcEU,2100320,2106960,okay we'll go eric here and come across  uh eric bailey with the tulsa world in  2009 coach garrido went through a
kpMYEBSOcEU,2106960,2112560,national runner-up season you were on  his bench what did you learn from coach  during that 29 season what did the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2112560,2118320,players learn after getting so close and  what do you expect  going forward
kpMYEBSOcEU,2118320,2123760,well i mean our expectation is always  going to win the national championship  that's not ever going to dwell on i mean
kpMYEBSOcEU,2123760,2129599,we  as soon as we practice every day that's  what we we're going to talk about
kpMYEBSOcEU,2129599,2135760,what i learned from coach garrido is one  pitch at a time and understanding what  the moment does to the environment does
kpMYEBSOcEU,2135760,2140800,to kids and to be try to be in control  of themselves one pitch at a time  because really that's what the game
kpMYEBSOcEU,2140800,2147119,demands you to do and that the game  demands you be a good teammate too and  to play as hard as you can and
kpMYEBSOcEU,2147119,2153440,and i'm thankful for my time with coach  urrito there's no doubt about that i  love the university of oklahoma and what
kpMYEBSOcEU,2153440,2158880,it represents it's like a family-owned  environment that's what's awesome about  it
kpMYEBSOcEU,2158880,2164079,okay josh  yeah skip josh kyle with all sooners i  know it's kind of adding on to that i
kpMYEBSOcEU,2164079,2169760,know it's probably pretty tough because  the season just ended but are you able  to have an appreciation you know just  for this year and everything the team
kpMYEBSOcEU,2169760,2174960,accomplished and this run obviously to  this point  no not really i'm i wanted to win the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2174960,2180320,national championship that's what was my  goal was and uh  you know continue to be my goal and you
kpMYEBSOcEU,2180320,2185520,and john  y'all fueled us a lot all year long with  the tweets and stuff about us being the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2185520,2191359,last place team in scc i wanted to wait  till the end to tell you that and i  appreciated that and so did every player
kpMYEBSOcEU,2191359,2197760,on our team  we'll get back to you jonathan jordan  jordan mccalpin at the omaha world
kpMYEBSOcEU,2197760,2204000,herald coach can you talk about the  growth you've seen from kate over the  course of the season  yeah i mean it was some something i
kpMYEBSOcEU,2204000,2209680,experienced  already you know with the kay cavalli  see cade was a two-way guy when we got
kpMYEBSOcEU,2209680,2214880,him  and uh  early in the year you know as a freshman
kpMYEBSOcEU,2214880,2220000,he comes in and i mean whatever it is he  had it  and then we go into january and he gets
kpMYEBSOcEU,2220000,2225920,hurt and uh  i'll never forget this as long as i live  we're getting we just got beat in tulsa
kpMYEBSOcEU,2225920,2230960,from  playing oklahoma state and he's sitting  right behind my bus seat and i turn
kpMYEBSOcEU,2230960,2237119,around and he stared out the window all  night long the whole ride home and i  thought to myself i was like this guy's
kpMYEBSOcEU,2237119,2244160,made it something different because you  got to be in a coach you got to look at  stuff like that you got to find the  value and what those guys go through and
kpMYEBSOcEU,2244160,2249599,so  when he started in coming back from the  far our
kpMYEBSOcEU,2249599,2256400,trainers and our strength coach did an  outstanding job of every day doing  something with him to get him better and
kpMYEBSOcEU,2256400,2261920,then we started the season off the first  month where he was our third starting  third baseman
kpMYEBSOcEU,2261920,2267280,and we kind of knew what was going to  happen if if it was one down the road  his arm started feeling better we
kpMYEBSOcEU,2267280,2273760,started throwing bullpens and so we had  cade cavalli before we're throwing him  in relief and we then we started
kpMYEBSOcEU,2273760,2279359,starting him at the end of the his  sophomore year so that's what we started  doing with him is we're throwing him
kpMYEBSOcEU,2279359,2285280,early in relief then we started starting  him at the end of the year and he got  better and better and better and better
kpMYEBSOcEU,2285280,2292480,and i still don't think he's a finished  product and  he's really good i get it but
kpMYEBSOcEU,2292480,2298320,he is  he's got poise he's got demeanor he  understands he's regurgitating
kpMYEBSOcEU,2298320,2303599,everything that we we talk about one  pitch at a time going to releases taking  deep breaths
kpMYEBSOcEU,2303599,2310480,uh standing his routines he's talking  like a guy that's a professional and  he's got a lot still a lot to grow in
kpMYEBSOcEU,2310480,2315920,that area and i'm so proud of him i  can't you know i mean that's what we  talk about that's what the university of
kpMYEBSOcEU,2315920,2322319,oklahoma is about it's about developing  young men  in that row
kpMYEBSOcEU,2322560,2329440,jonathan  skip will try to do better on the  podcast from now on that's all right
kpMYEBSOcEU,2329440,2336079,so i want to ask you further about cade  just his performance today how good was  that uh big 12 not big 12 college world
kpMYEBSOcEU,2336079,2342160,series championship series record 13  strikeouts they just kept piling up as  the pressure mounted yeah i mean he
kpMYEBSOcEU,2342160,2348240,wanted to go back out and um  that inning and i said if one guy gets  on we're going to go to trevin and you
kpMYEBSOcEU,2348240,2354640,can see him on the mound that's what you  want out of a young man but sooner or  later we as coaches and as pitching
kpMYEBSOcEU,2354640,2360560,coaches i am i got to take the ball out  of his hand because he's going to go  until he can't go anymore i mean he
kpMYEBSOcEU,2360560,2366240,that's that's that's in his dna he's  going to he's going to battle you and uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,2366240,2372160,that's what's awesome about him watching  him play high school football or or  watching him uh pitching a game or
kpMYEBSOcEU,2372160,2378079,having it at bat that's who he is it's  what he's about and and i couldn't find  a better young man to represent the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2378079,2383839,university of oklahoma than him  blake lee benson from kwtv in oklahoma
kpMYEBSOcEU,2383839,2390960,city you've talked about this a little  bit already uh but  game ends and you get back in the locker  room around the guys what
kpMYEBSOcEU,2390960,2396400,it's probably difficult what is that  message that you know the first thing  you talk to them about you know is there  anything but what do you say when that
kpMYEBSOcEU,2396400,2402079,happens  um  first thing is you can accomplish  anything you put your mind to it
kpMYEBSOcEU,2402079,2407760,you can be anybody you want to be you  put your mind to it secondly the game  doesn't care how you feel that's why the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2407760,2415440,details in the game are so important  and you got to keep fighting for every  inch that you get in this in in baseball
kpMYEBSOcEU,2415440,2422560,and you got to continue to work you did  a great job i love you really proud of  you really proud of the coaches i mean

kpMYEBSOcEU,2428319,2434000,as a as a team we got to con i'm just  happy in that sense
kpMYEBSOcEU,2434000,2439839,mad pissed off about losing and uh i'm  not happy about that
kpMYEBSOcEU,2439839,2446000,okay we have a question from zoom please  state your name and affiliation and the  question
kpMYEBSOcEU,2446480,2452720,hey skip jenny carlson with the  oklahoman um kade was talking about how  this team had to learn to win and but
kpMYEBSOcEU,2452720,2458240,obviously you guys did that  um to do that though at a time when you
kpMYEBSOcEU,2458240,2465520,guys really needed to start to pile up  some wins to make the ncaa tournament  really get some momentum how hard of a
kpMYEBSOcEU,2465520,2471040,task was that what your guys  accomplished really turning the corner  like they did this season
kpMYEBSOcEU,2471040,2478160,well jen the one thing that you can you  can in baseball is a  confidence is a fragile piece of ice the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2478160,2485599,guys wanting at the end of the game  they're wanting the ball wanting to be  in situations they're in control of  themselves uh the moment's not too big
kpMYEBSOcEU,2485599,2492000,for them um  and  you know when the ground ball hit to him  wanting the fly ball hit to him the
kpMYEBSOcEU,2492000,2497520,mindset of the guys sitting on the bench  the bench guys are just as important as  the guys on the field because their
kpMYEBSOcEU,2497520,2503920,synergy provides what goes on in the uh  in the game and uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,2503920,2509040,they got through that they broke that  they broke through that mode of knowing  how to win and understanding what that
kpMYEBSOcEU,2509040,2515920,is and wanting the ball hit to him  wanting to be in those situations i can  remember peyton graham
kpMYEBSOcEU,2515920,2522720,hitting a grand slam gets i forget who  it was to win the game it was incredible  we think we had two of them and those
kpMYEBSOcEU,2522720,2528880,guys him hitting the two-run homer and  uh  in florida to tie the game was just
kpMYEBSOcEU,2528880,2534000,incredible that's what i'm that's what  he's talking about when they figured out  how to win and how they figured out how
kpMYEBSOcEU,2534000,2542240,to pull for each other whether it's  bringing  diego into hit or him getting that bunt  down or sebastian uh coming off when uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,2542240,2547440,brett got hurt that's what shows you  what a good culture's about guys are  still
kpMYEBSOcEU,2547440,2552640,they understand they have value and they  understand they're going to fight to to  the better in

kpMYEBSOcEU,3344640,3350960,game and there i i had no emotion it was  it was a dream come true  uh ever since you're a little kid you
kpMYEBSOcEU,3350960,3356319,dream of being on the mound in those  situations and when it happened  you just let go of yourself because you
kpMYEBSOcEU,3356319,3362559,realized that you did do it and it  didn't hit me until  probably probably 20 minutes after it  happened after the last pitch actually
kpMYEBSOcEU,3362559,3369040,happened of what was going on uh so when  it happened the motions were true  because there was none
kpMYEBSOcEU,3369359,3375520,okay  dylan also knows with the rebel walk you  go from transfer into ole miss this year

kpMYEBSOcEU,3861839,3868000,approaches those things you know he's  he's amazing and you know i think we  mentioned it after his last start
kpMYEBSOcEU,3868000,3873280,um  you know um  there's there's young young guys it's
kpMYEBSOcEU,3873280,3879599,it's more than talent there's there's  guys that throw harder there's guys that  get better breaking balls guys that have  better change-ups and that's not trying
kpMYEBSOcEU,3879599,3887839,to  um demean his you know uh abilities i  mean he's obviously very talented um but
kpMYEBSOcEU,3887839,3895119,you know i think if you ask any of the  coaches you know his toughness his  belief  um you know to be able to make pitches
kpMYEBSOcEU,3895119,3900400,uh and we we saw that through sec play  but once we got the postseason you watch
kpMYEBSOcEU,3900400,3906079,them in miami uh i've mentioned where uh  we had bases loaded you're playing the
kpMYEBSOcEU,3906079,3912400,you know a national seat on their park  or in their park on their field  um they don't lose there and he has
kpMYEBSOcEU,3912400,3919119,bases loading the first and gets out of  it and that's  kind of what he's done all year and then  you watch him go to hattiesburg and you
kpMYEBSOcEU,3919119,3925680,know play in a tough tough environment  there and and just you know pitches his  best game you know of the year and gets
kpMYEBSOcEU,3925680,3932480,to omaha and you know the talent just  continues got the hotter teams are there  uh he just continues the bigger the
kpMYEBSOcEU,3932480,3937839,stage uh the better he gets and uh  that's you know when you're watching
kpMYEBSOcEU,3937839,3943039,enough sports like you have and i have  that's what the great ones do don't they  when the stage
kpMYEBSOcEU,3943039,3950400,is big you know and uh you know the  importance of the game that's when they  really shine and he's one of those guys
kpMYEBSOcEU,3950400,3956640,okay  i want to start right here  coach austin does the rebel walk i know  for you every group that you have is
kpMYEBSOcEU,3956640,3962240,special but this one in particular just  talk about your emotions and what this  particular group of guys means for you
kpMYEBSOcEU,3962240,3968079,after they've won a national  championship yeah it's hard to put into  words to be honest i mean
kpMYEBSOcEU,3968079,3975039,you know  game ends and a lot of hugs and a lot of  gatorade and a lot of interviews out
kpMYEBSOcEU,3975039,3982079,there and you know trying everybody's  asking you about your emotions you know  it's tough but this team
kpMYEBSOcEU,3982079,3987520,when you and you've listened to them and  interviewed them i mean it
kpMYEBSOcEU,3987520,3992799,what a neat job i have you know it's uh  to be around these guys and guys and i
kpMYEBSOcEU,3992799,4000319,mean it you know just just great kids  you know great representatives of our  university uh they play this game at a
kpMYEBSOcEU,4000319,4007359,very very high level um  you know they're just good guys and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4007359,4013520,we've had great leadership as i  mentioned earlier and uh just to watch  them do this you know i shared with them
kpMYEBSOcEU,4013520,4020640,uh and i said it several times now um  you know uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,4020640,4028000,life's tough you know and there's bad  things that happen to everybody good  people bad things happen and uh you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4028000,4034000,you these guys have worked really hard  and i think they've showed you a lot of  people you know that you know you can
kpMYEBSOcEU,4034000,4039839,fall down you can stumble and you can  fail but that doesn't mean you're a  failure you know uh if you continue to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4039839,4045839,work hard and continue to push and  continue to believe as tim said  you can accomplish anything
kpMYEBSOcEU,4045839,4051760,that's not some poster  or some tweet you know to motivate you
kpMYEBSOcEU,4051760,4056799,we've all heard that these guys have  lived that  you know this season they really have
kpMYEBSOcEU,4056799,4061920,they've they've fallen down where you  know not a lot of people believe that  they were any good anymore and you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4061920,4068640,a lot of people may have been  disappointed in them  and i get that it's sports and that's  part of it
kpMYEBSOcEU,4068640,4074640,but they didn't let that affect them  they continued to believe in one another  they continued to push
kpMYEBSOcEU,4074640,4080240,i think that's why you had 20 000 plus  fans show up you know here you know um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4080240,4085520,because this is a special group they  knew it was a special group it wasn't  just a national championship i i
kpMYEBSOcEU,4085520,4092000,honestly believe that i mean they're  during the trophy presentation  when you look in the stands i mean the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4092000,4099278,stadium holds 25 000 and it looked  almost still packed i mean that's how  many fans we had here and so this this
kpMYEBSOcEU,4099278,4105040,group of young men  i think  people have fallen in love with them
kpMYEBSOcEU,4105040,4110560,their story and what they where they  come from and you know uh you know they  had a lot of people rooting for them and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4110560,4115679,not just ole miss fans i mean i i can't  ima you know i've gotten so many texts
kpMYEBSOcEU,4115679,4122640,over the last couple weeks from a lot of  our  rivals you know a lot of you know the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4122640,4128159,people that we compete against every  single day that said you know they're  pulling for us that they've fallen in
kpMYEBSOcEU,4128159,4134960,love with this story and these guys and  you know i'm just again i said at the  very beginning very fortunate to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4134960,4140080,been been a part of it to let those guys  allow me you know to to be on the ride  with them
kpMYEBSOcEU,4140080,4145120,okay michael oh john  okay
kpMYEBSOcEU,4145120,4150159,mike john  john stockholm wcbi tv in columbus i  know you've been asked about your  emotions a lot but specifically when it
kpMYEBSOcEU,4150159,4155520,comes to tim i i know i know we've  you've talked to that was why the really  long answer so we would get out of the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4155520,4160640,emotion question  but when it comes to him i mean that was  the last game you're going to coach him
kpMYEBSOcEU,4160640,4166000,in i mean has that set in at all that  you know you won't know  him you know and i almost said something
kpMYEBSOcEU,4166000,4171440,to you john earlier you know this is  such a a great time i don't think  anybody wants to think about it's the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4171440,4177920,last time you know i was going to say  man that's that's kind of cruel you know  um you know and i think you probably saw
kpMYEBSOcEU,4177920,4184560,that from tim's reaction you know like  he hadn't even thought about that yet  and you're right you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4184560,4191359,but i'll tell you  this isn't what you asked but i'll tell  you this  um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4191600,4197040,i've never won a national championship  and so i've been a head coach what 25  years
kpMYEBSOcEU,4197040,4202480,so you've always lost the last game  you've always hoped that you would you  know you were going to win it and move
kpMYEBSOcEU,4202480,4208400,on to the next round step whatever that  was  and so when you walk out in that field
kpMYEBSOcEU,4208400,4213600,which you've seen seven other teams do  here  and you got a bunch of young men 18 to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4213600,4219120,22 years old that are crying and uh  knowing that this is the last game and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4219120,4224560,this is how  it's going to end that season and some  of them that'll never put the uniform on
kpMYEBSOcEU,4224560,4229600,again you know they won't get a chance  to play professional baseball this is it  and this is how it's going to end and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4229600,4236159,nobody's prepared for that i've always  struggled you know in that moment  because i didn't have a speech prepared
kpMYEBSOcEU,4236159,4242880,um so that to end on a winning note  man it's it's really neat and so they
kpMYEBSOcEU,4242880,4248080,didn't have to go through that they  didn't have to be out there with all the  hugs and the tears and lord knows tim
kpMYEBSOcEU,4248080,4255280,and the other guys they've been through  that enough you know so they deserve  this  okay back over here
kpMYEBSOcEU,4255280,4260320,chaseborne rebels.com mike jacob has  such a big day today how's he kind of  handled the last couple weeks scuff a
kpMYEBSOcEU,4260320,4266320,little bit and then coming through as he  did yeah he he's he's a superstar
kpMYEBSOcEU,4266320,4272960,it's tough you know baseball is a tough  game and sometimes you don't have you  know good weekend or a good game and um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4272960,4278960,you know i grabbed them  yesterday you know and you know i told  them i said take a deep breath you're a
kpMYEBSOcEU,4278960,4285120,superstar you're gonna be fine um  part of the tough week is
kpMYEBSOcEU,4285120,4290239,we face some really good pitchers and  some tough left-handers you know uh the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4290239,4297199,couple days against arkansas he faced  hagen smith freshman all-american who  hagan you we weren't sure if he you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4297199,4302880,was getting tired or hitting a wall and  he pitched as well as he's pitched all  year here you know a few days ago and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4302880,4309520,then the taylor kid uh pitched twice  against us  and you know his opponent's batting  average is like under a hundred so
kpMYEBSOcEU,4309520,4315760,nobody hits him you know it's not just  jacob or graham like nobody hits them  and so you know it's kind of been some
kpMYEBSOcEU,4315760,4321760,bad matchups for him and uh  but uh he's terrific and uh we're glad
kpMYEBSOcEU,4321760,4326880,he's on our team  okay jay  jake thompson ole miss spirit mike's
kpMYEBSOcEU,4326880,4332719,kind of same question asked brandon  dylan just can you put into words what  this pitching staff has done this past  month how they've just kind of put it
kpMYEBSOcEU,4332719,4337920,all together and you know uh  they deserve a lot of credit i think
kpMYEBSOcEU,4337920,4344960,when you look back statistically and  it's a team game and uh we we have a  great offense but we're we're we're not
kpMYEBSOcEU,4344960,4350159,in omaha and we're certainly not winning  a national championship if we don't  pitch to pitch it like we have and you
kpMYEBSOcEU,4350159,4356320,know the guys have been terrific and  you know it just  and i think brandon was right once once
kpMYEBSOcEU,4356320,4361360,you know  uh  delusion became the ace that he did
kpMYEBSOcEU,4361360,4366880,it's you're a different team you know  when you don't have an ace  it's hard to win and especially in our
kpMYEBSOcEU,4366880,4372800,lake i mean friday nights are a bear in  the sec and if you don't have a guy that  can match up with the other other team's
kpMYEBSOcEU,4372800,4379040,ace you have no shot and i think once  that happened and then hunter  came along and you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4379040,4387600,you know kind of filled in at two slot  you know we had a pretty good one-two  punch similar to last year uh and uh and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4387600,4393920,again uh i think that also helped the  bullpen you know to kind of solidify  some of those pieces and and you saw
kpMYEBSOcEU,4393920,4400400,even today  how electric brandon johnson can be and  it's almost a shame um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4400400,4406880,that if he  if we would have had a better year and a  different season  how great his season would have been
kpMYEBSOcEU,4406880,4412320,because man he's about as good as  anybody at the back end but we've had to  use them in so many different ways and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4412320,4419599,then when you look in the postseason  we've hit and scored and we kept the  score down where  um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4420560,4427760,this may be  is this the only save opportunity  was this the only save opportunity
kpMYEBSOcEU,4427760,4435520,how about that to win a national  championship  and this may be the only time you you  got to save maybe or will it close if
kpMYEBSOcEU,4435520,4442239,it's not it's it's close and so the  point is wow you know there's been times  where he didn't pitch a weekend we won a  super regional didn't use our closer
kpMYEBSOcEU,4442239,4449280,like wow and so you know it's been hard  on him you know not running out there  not what i'd say not emotionally but
kpMYEBSOcEU,4449280,4454400,the regiment of a closer running out  there getting hot and pitching and so i  was a little worried you know we pitched
kpMYEBSOcEU,4454400,4459440,him with a 10-run lead because i was so  worried like we got to get him on the  mound so he can throw so
kpMYEBSOcEU,4459440,4466000,and again that the next time he pitches  is the national championship game  okay aaron
kpMYEBSOcEU,4466000,4471040,eric fit do you want baseball uh you  know coach a lot has been made of  oklahoma's style of play of course
kpMYEBSOcEU,4471040,4477679,yesterday you guys hit all those home  runs but today it seemed like in the  eighth inning that hit and run was a  crucial moment can you kind of uh take
kpMYEBSOcEU,4477679,4484800,us through the thought process there and  what do you think that did for this team  jump started  um it really wasn't a hit and run i mean
kpMYEBSOcEU,4484800,4491840,it was a steal by mccance and you know  bench you know uh poked a little live  drive to right but we knew
kpMYEBSOcEU,4491840,4498719,uh at least i felt um  you know  we got our our best base stealer on base
kpMYEBSOcEU,4498719,4504400,um you know top of the lineup you know  coming up with two outs uh i think most
kpMYEBSOcEU,4504400,4510719,baseball minds say man you're gonna have  to pick pick a picture and go try to get  him in scoring position if he gets
kpMYEBSOcEU,4510719,4515840,thrown out then you have the top of the  line up in the bottom and ninth and you  know you try to you know you know tie it
kpMYEBSOcEU,4515840,4521040,up or maybe get a walk off and to be  honest with you uh that even you know  pushing because i was sitting there
kpMYEBSOcEU,4521040,4527600,thinking you know we have not had a walk  off the entire season  that's another one can you imagine how  many times somebody won a national
kpMYEBSOcEU,4527600,4533600,championship and not had a walk-off win  and um and so maybe we're going to do it  in the bottom of the ninth in the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4533600,4539679,national championship game so when they  brought in the closer we grabbed tj and  said hey you know we're gonna you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4539679,4545040,if you you go whenever you want but  we're gonna pick a pitch and give you a  steal no matter what and so you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4545040,4551600,after the first breaking ball we we  chose to steal  bench you know gets a hit because he's  allowed to swing with the guy in motion
kpMYEBSOcEU,4551600,4556960,we get first to third  and then  as
kpMYEBSOcEU,4556960,4563280,chase said i know it hasn't been a great  week it hasn't been an awful week for  jacob but it hasn't been a great week
kpMYEBSOcEU,4563280,4570080,but we weren't going to steal bench he's  going to have a lot of room on the right  side to hit a ball um you know i i felt
kpMYEBSOcEU,4570080,4577520,really good at that at that point where  we were that we were going to win  okay my favorite reporter jocelyn
kpMYEBSOcEU,4577520,4583679,johnson stamp sports illustrated kids  mississippi state won last year does ole  miss winning this year add any fuel to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4583679,4586239,the rivalry
kpMYEBSOcEU,4589199,4595360,from sports illustrated kids we get that  question wow
kpMYEBSOcEU,4595360,4602159,yeah man put you on the spot  i'm sure it will you know i'm sure you  know our fan base
kpMYEBSOcEU,4602159,4610880,will be very proud  uh  i'll leave it at that  but i will say this uh and this seems
kpMYEBSOcEU,4610880,4616640,maybe too nice for your question um  but when we  um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4616640,4622080,won in hattiesburg super regional i got  a text from chris lobonis the head coach  at mississippi state and i got a text
kpMYEBSOcEU,4622080,4629120,from  coach gotcha their hitting coach both of  them congratulations uh and good luck in
kpMYEBSOcEU,4629120,4634960,omaha and my response back to both of  them was thanks so much i really  appreciate it and we're hoping to keep
kpMYEBSOcEU,4634960,4642080,the trophy in mississippi as we're  leaving hattiesburg mississippi that was  a you know a national seed that hosted a
kpMYEBSOcEU,4642080,4647600,regional super regional so uh the  rivalry is great but it's  rivalry
kpMYEBSOcEU,4647600,4653120,with all you know three of us because we  all three of us have great baseball  programs
kpMYEBSOcEU,4653120,4658960,okay rick  uh rick cleveland mississippi today mike  the um
kpMYEBSOcEU,4658960,4666560,the squeeze play i believe is in the  sixth inning  what did you see and and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4666640,4673280,yeah thank god for the jumbotron huh  jeez  um yeah i was frustrated because i went
kpMYEBSOcEU,4673280,4679040,out you know the pitch before and knew  that they would safety squeeze or  thought they would safety squeeze so we
kpMYEBSOcEU,4679040,4686320,went just made sure everybody knew what  they were supposed to do terrific bunt  um you know by their lead off guy
kpMYEBSOcEU,4686320,4692560,and  hunter being left-handed you know made  the play much more difficult for him uh
kpMYEBSOcEU,4692560,4699520,he throws the ball and of course you  know another bump play in this world  series it looks like we're going to  screw up and it goes ball goes in and we
kpMYEBSOcEU,4699520,4705600,give up the run and as i just by chance  because i don't look at the jumbo tron a  lot i just like looked up not because of
kpMYEBSOcEU,4705600,4711360,that and i went my gosh he's like he's  out of the running lane and so that's  why i ran on the field and it's so loud
kpMYEBSOcEU,4711360,4717520,usually you can yell to the umpire but  you can't hear anything out there and so  you know i ran out there because i don't
kpMYEBSOcEU,4717520,4723120,want a pitch to be thrown or you're done  and uh you know so yeah give that to the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4723120,4729360,scoreboard credits goes to the  scoreboard guy  okay we're running out of time so nick
kpMYEBSOcEU,4729360,4736640,nick says clarion ledger mike for a guy  like gaddis to get those four crucial  outs for you guys deferred medical  school to to come to ole miss just how
kpMYEBSOcEU,4736640,4741760,important was that just the season he's  had how how crucial has he been since he  brought him in yeah he's he's been
kpMYEBSOcEU,4741760,4748239,terrific and you know like a lot of the  arms uh that are really good uh we  struggled to find roles we struggled to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4748239,4753440,kind of define roles and figure it out  and you've seen it all year nick and you  know we thought he had a tremendous fall
kpMYEBSOcEU,4753440,4758800,we thought he was going to you know be  one of the the three guys on the weekend  and once we got into conference play
kpMYEBSOcEU,4758800,4763920,that was tough and then he had an  appendectomy and you know like a lot of  things that have happened you know
kpMYEBSOcEU,4763920,4769600,through that month of you know april um  but he's just a tough kid just a great
kpMYEBSOcEU,4769600,4775600,kid  um  and  how about that you your kid was going to
kpMYEBSOcEU,4775600,4781679,go to medical school a year ago and then  said hey you know i had a pretty good  year i  want to try to go to omaha and he picks
kpMYEBSOcEU,4781679,4787280,ole miss and he gets to win in the  national championship game that's  another really cool story
kpMYEBSOcEU,4787280,4792800,okay our last question michael  make it a good one
kpMYEBSOcEU,4792800,4798800,michael katz daily journal i think it  was on selection day or years after  coral gables you told us that in the
kpMYEBSOcEU,4798800,4803920,postseason the key is obviously you have  to have your stars come through but it's  also about the other guys and throughout
kpMYEBSOcEU,4803920,4809840,the postseason we've seen calvin harris  and mccance and garrett wood and jack  dougherty and gaddis have these moments
kpMYEBSOcEU,4809840,4816400,can you just talk a little bit about  those guys  yeah  i've always uh  you're right you know michael i i've
kpMYEBSOcEU,4816400,4823120,always believed you know tournament play  you know so tough um  and you know to to to win
kpMYEBSOcEU,4823120,4830080,uh at the end of the season your your  stars have to show up you know they got  to perform on the stage and and
kpMYEBSOcEU,4830080,4836159,and certainly our guys have but to to  win uh and to move on you need the guys
kpMYEBSOcEU,4836159,4842480,that you know that maybe nobody was  expecting you know media day they  weren't the guys that were you know uh
