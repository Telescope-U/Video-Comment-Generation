K4FmAHkMCVA,191724,197162,PRESSURE TOP DOJ LEADERS TO   COME UP WITH AN INVESTIGATION   OR AT LEAST LOOK LIKE THEY WERE   CONDUCT IN AN INVESTIGATION 
K4FmAHkMCVA,197162,203870,INTO THE CLAIMS OF VOTER FRAUD. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,203870,209141,THE HEARING WILL BE   QUARTERBACKED BY THE REPUBLICAN   ADAM KISSINGER AND I HAVE A   CHANCE TO DISCUSS WITH HIM HOW  HE SEES THIS PORTION OF THE

K4FmAHkMCVA,216482,223056,PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO USE THE   DOJ AS CREDIBILITY AGAINST THE  ELECTION RESULTS?   >> IT'S VERY FAIR TO SAY.   IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,223056,229228,PRESIDENT WANTED THE STAMP OF   DOUBT THAT COMES WITH THE DOJ   SEAL. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,229228,235200,>> PART 1 OF THE HEARING IS THE

K4FmAHkMCVA,254086,263730,NAMED JEFF CLARK IS AN  ENVIRONMENT A LAWYER AND WHO  THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THERE  WAS A SCHEME TO HAVE HIM TAKE   CONTROL OF THE DOJ AND INSTEAD
K4FmAHkMCVA,263730,270203,THERE WAS A REVOLT AMONG TOP  DOJ OFFICIALS AND STAFFERS WHO  SAID THEY WOULD NOT SERVE UNDER   CLARK AND SO THAT PORTION OF  THE PLAN WAS NEVER PUT INTO

K4FmAHkMCVA,295461,300800,PROBABLY THE MOST DIRECT  PARALLEL OF WATER GREAT --
K4FmAHkMCVA,300800,307173,WATERGATE AND HE ESSENTIALLY  WANTED THE PEOPLE INVESTIGATING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,307173,312245,BUT FIRED AND NEEDED THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BECOME  COMPLIANT.
K4FmAHkMCVA,312245,321286,THIS WAS A CASE OF IT LOOKS   LIKE THIS IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP  WILL DO AND THERE IS NO LOSS  HERE THAT SAY -- THEY WORK FOR
K4FmAHkMCVA,321286,326959,THE PRESIDENT AND HE COULD HAVE   DONE THAT.
K4FmAHkMCVA,326959,337637,IT WAS THE ACCEPTED PRACTICE  AND BILL CLINTON WANTED TO FIRE   HIS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR A BUNCH  OF TIMES BUT HE COULDN'T AND
K4FmAHkMCVA,337637,343543,"POLITICALLY HE WOULD NOT TOUCH  JANET RENO AND IT DID NOT   HAPPEN.   TODAY, THIS IS HOW HE TRIED TO  ESSENTIALLY USE THE GOVERNMENT"
K4FmAHkMCVA,343543,349348,AND OF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO GIVE MORE   CREDIBILITY.  YOU WILL HEAR IN SOME OF THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,349348,354653,SNIPPETS THAT HE SIMPLY WANTED  THE ANNOUNCEMENT.   GIVE ME THE PRESS RELEASE AND I 
K4FmAHkMCVA,354653,364297,WILL SPEND IT.  WE WILL DO THE RUST IS WHAT IT  WAS . THE MOST SHOCKING PART IS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,364297,370036,DONALD TRUMP DECIDED NOT TO DO  IT.   THAT IS THE PART OF THIS THAT I 
K4FmAHkMCVA,370036,377577,THINK IS ALWAYS BEEN AND FOR  WHAT IT'S WORTH IT MAKES IT A   LITTLE BIT TOUGHER TO CHARGE  HIM WITH SOMETHING OVER TIME. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,377577,385918,MR. CLARK IS AND A LOT MORE   POTENTIALLY LEGAL TROUBLE THAN  TRUMP BECAUSE HE DID NOT PULL   THE TRIGGER BUT IT DOES SEEM AS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,385918,392057,IF HE WAS CLOSE AND THE MORE I  LEARN ABOUT THAT THE MORE I AM  PERSONALLY SURPRISED HE DID NOT   GO THROUGH WITH IT. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,392057,398598,>> ALL THE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN A   STORY OF THE PRESIDENT WALKING  RIGHT UP TO THE LINE AND IT IS  SO CLEAR AND SOME OF THE CASES
K4FmAHkMCVA,398598,405872,WHETHER HE CROSSED IT. WHAT ARE   YOU LOOKING FOR?  >> THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 
K4FmAHkMCVA,405872,412612,CONVERSATIONS WITH THE  PRESIDENT AND WE WILL HEAR FROM 
K4FmAHkMCVA,412612,418384,A COUPLE OF THEM IN THE ROOM  WITH HIM IN SOME CASES IS TOP   WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND OTHER   PEOPLE WHO WERE KEY TO THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,418384,426058,"INNER CIRCLE.   AT ANY POINT DID DONALD TRUMP   ACKNOWLEDGE TO THEM THAT WHAT   HE WAS DOING, HE KNEW WAS   VIOLATING THE LAW."
K4FmAHkMCVA,426058,433031,"I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY  PIECES. WHEN YOU LOOK BROADLY   AT THIS, A LOT OF THE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,433031,438037,"CONVERSATIONS WE WILL HERE HAVE   BEEN REPORTED BY OUR OUTLET,  THE NEW YORK TIMES AND"
K4FmAHkMCVA,438037,444810,WASHINGTON POST BUT WHAT WILL   BE CRITICAL IS THE STORYLINE AS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,444810,450983,IT WEAVES TOGETHER AND THE  CHARACTERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO   MEET AND IN SOME WAY IT'S A   TALE OF TWO JEFF'S.   JEFFREY CLARK THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
K4FmAHkMCVA,450983,456989,LAWYER WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO
K4FmAHkMCVA,456989,464964,THE PRESIDENT AND CONNECTED TO  THE PRESIDENT THROUGH A   REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS   WHO WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT AND   WHO BACKED THE PRESIDENTS AND 
K4FmAHkMCVA,464964,470570,WAS SYMPATHETIC TO THAT AND   JEFFREY CLARK WROTE A LETTER
K4FmAHkMCVA,470570,475741,"DESCRIBING WAYS THAT HE THOUGHT   THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD IN THE  STATE OF GEORGIA, FOR EXAMPLE,"
K4FmAHkMCVA,475741,481180,"PUSHBACK AND JEFFREY ROSEN AND  THE OTHER WITNESSES, RICHARD"
K4FmAHkMCVA,481180,488153,"DONAHUE AND STEPHEN ENGEL, THEY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,488153,493892,"WERE PUSHING HARD AGAINST THE   PRESIDENT THE OTHER WAY.  ALL IN THE MEETINGS SANE IF YOU   PUT JEFFREY CLARK IN CHARGE, WE   ARE DONE.   THESE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTING"
K4FmAHkMCVA,493892,499198,AND WE TALKED ABOUT JEFF ROSEN  THE ONETIME ACTING ATTORNEY   GENERAL IN THE JOB FOR ABOUT  ONE MONTH.
K4FmAHkMCVA,499198,504637,>> THAT IS A MYSTERY WE ARE NOT   SOLVING THE BILL BARR HAS NEVER 
K4FmAHkMCVA,504637,514046,GIVEN A SIMPLE EXPLANATION AS   TO WHY HE QUIT EARLY.   HE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO TELL   THE PRESIDENT NO.   >> HE DID TELL THE PRESIDENT NO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,514046,521687,.   >> AND ALSO DECIDED TO WALK AWAY  BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO DO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,521687,528160,WHAT HE MIGHT BE ASKED TO DO  NEXT AND IT IS STILL -- THE   FACT THAT BAR LEFT JEFFREY
K4FmAHkMCVA,528160,535768,ROSEN IN THE POSITION HAS BEEN  SOMETHING THAT NEEDS A LITTLE   MORE EXPLORATION.   >> YOU HAVE A GUY NAMED RICHARD 
K4FmAHkMCVA,535768,541474,"DONAHUE WHO WE KNOW TOOK NOTES,   HANDWRITTEN NOTES ABOUT SOME OF "
K4FmAHkMCVA,541474,549315,THESE MEETINGS
K4FmAHkMCVA,549315,554553,", FASCINATING NOTES BECAUSE   HE'S DESCRIBING THINGS THAT   DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING AND I   WILL BE SHOCKED IF IT DOESN'T   COME UP IN THE HEARING TODAY. "
K4FmAHkMCVA,554553,559558,"HE'S DESCRIBING PIECES OF THE   CONVERSATION WHERE THE FORMER   PRESIDENT SAID, ALL I NEED IS   FOR YOU AND I'M PARAPHRASING, "
K4FmAHkMCVA,559558,566832,"TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT,   REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MIGHT  JUST SAY THE ELECTION WAS "
K4FmAHkMCVA,566832,572038,CORRUPT AND LEAVE THE RUST TO   ME  IS WHAT RICHARD DONOGHUE
K4FmAHkMCVA,572038,577643,SAID.   >> ANYTHING OUT OF THE JUSTICE
K4FmAHkMCVA,577643,584216,"DEPARTMENT .  >> I'M ALSO INTERESTED IN   STEPHEN ENGEL THE FORMER  ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THE DOJ,  NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME AND NOT"
K4FmAHkMCVA,584216,590089,SOMEBODY AT THE CENTER OF A LOT   OF DISCUSSION.  THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS ON THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,590089,595594,SUPREME COURT LONG LIST FROM  PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS IN
K4FmAHkMCVA,595594,600733,OFFICE IN DECEMBER 2020 IN CASE   THERE HAD BEEN AN OPENING AND 
K4FmAHkMCVA,600733,606372,SOMEONE WHO IS A WELL-RESPECTED   ATTORNEY WHO WAS ALSO IN THESE  MEETINGS AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN   A LOT OF REPORTING ABOUT THIS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,606372,611944,AND WHAT HE SAW AND HEARD.  THERE ARE A LOT OF STRINGS TO   PULL ON.
K4FmAHkMCVA,611944,617349,>> LET ME GO TO HER WASHINGTON  CORRESPONDENT WHO IS WISH WITH  US TODAY. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,617349,627359,WHAT MIGHT BE MOST IMPACTFUL  AND WHY?
K4FmAHkMCVA,627359,632364,>> THEY MIGHT BE THE MOST   IMPACTFUL BECAUSE YOU WILL HEAR   FROM DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  OFFICIALS ABOUT THEIR DIRECT  CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER   PRESIDENT TRUMP.
K4FmAHkMCVA,632364,638671,THERE HAS BEEN A LOT SAID ABOUT   WHAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE HEARD OR 
K4FmAHkMCVA,638671,644477,SAW BUT THESE WILL BE THE   PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM   WITH THE PRESIDENT AND WE HEARD   FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ON   CALL WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,644477,652918,"THESE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO KNOW   FIRSTHAND JUST HOW FAR THE  FORMER PRESIDENT WAS WILLING TO   GO AND A LOT OF THE ISSUES,   THERE IS THIS KEYWORD, THE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,652918,658190,REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT PERRY AND  A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  AND THE LAWMAKERS SAY TRYING TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,658190,663763,SEEK THE PARDON AFTER JANUARY 6   AND EVEN IN SOME CASES IN THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,663763,668768,DAYS BEFORE JANUARY 6 BECAUSE   THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE   ACTIVITY THEY HAD TAKEN PART  IN. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,668768,676108,"IT'S GOING TO BE VERY   INTERESTING TO LEARN, DID "
K4FmAHkMCVA,676108,681880,FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TALK   ABOUT THAT AND WHAT ROLE COULD  THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE  HAD AND THAT AND JEFFREY CLARK  WILL BE FASCINATING TO HEAR 
K4FmAHkMCVA,681880,687519,ABOUT BECAUSE WE HEARD ABOUT
K4FmAHkMCVA,687519,692692,"HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE FIVE-  PAGE LETTER THAT HE WROTE, A  DRAFT LETTER ABOUT WHAT THE DOJ   CAN DO AND HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,692692,700366,TELL STATES TO NOT CONTINUE   COUNTING VOTES BUT ALSO JEFFREY   CLARK WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD A 
K4FmAHkMCVA,700366,707873,MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE  WHERE HIS BOSSES NOT WEARING A
K4FmAHkMCVA,707873,713979,SUIT AND WAS OUT JOGGING AND  HAD TO RUN TO THE WHITE HOUSE   TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE FORMER   PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT TO PUT
K4FmAHkMCVA,713979,719185,JEFFREY CLARK IN CHARGE.  THE POLITICS ARE GOING TO BE  SOMETHING I WILL BE WATCHING
K4FmAHkMCVA,719185,729795,BECAUSE WE KNOW NOW THE BIDEN   DEMONSTRATION UNDER A LOT OF  PRESSURE TO REALLY BE MORE  AGGRESSIVE WITH MERRICK GARLAN
K4FmAHkMCVA,729795,734967,", THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND  TRYING TO PUSH HIM TO PROSECUTE   MORE PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH  THE JANUARY 6 INVESTIGATION AND   SOME DEMOCRATS TOLD ME THEY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,734967,740372,WANT THE DOJ TO BE DOING MORE   BUT THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,740372,747246,OVER AND OVER THAT THEY WILL  NOT BE PRESSURED INTO DOING   WHAT THEY THINK THE PREDECESSOR   DID WITH TREATING THE DOJ AS A  PERSONAL LEGAL ARM AND INSTEAD
K4FmAHkMCVA,747246,752618,PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID I AM GOING   TO ALLOW THE DOJ TO BE VERY   INDEPENDENT AND THAT IS THE   POLITICS OF THIS WILL BE
K4FmAHkMCVA,752618,761894,INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THE  POSITION OF THESE TWO   ADMINISTRATIONS.
K4FmAHkMCVA,761894,768600,>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR NBC   NEWS LEGAL ANALYST AND CRIMINAL   DEFENSE ATTORNEY.   WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT BILL  BARR AND HE'S GOT A LOT OF AIR
K4FmAHkMCVA,768600,774206,TIME AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT HIM   PROBABLY AGAIN TODAY AND HE HAS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,774206,779979,"POSITIONED AS THE GUY THAT  STOOD UP EARLY AND SAID, MR.  PRESIDENT, THE VOTES ARE HERE.  WHAT SHOULD WE KNOW AS WE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,779979,787052,CONTINUE TO WATCH?  >> BILL BARR HAS GOTTEN THE   KIND OF PASTS AND IT'S PROBABLY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,787052,795661,BECAUSE HE MAY HAVE THE MOST  MEMORABLE LINE TO DATE IN THESE   PROCEEDINGS AND I WANT REPEATED   HERE BUT IT STARTS WITH A B AND 
K4FmAHkMCVA,795661,801100,IT WAS AROUND THE WORLD AND   PEOPLE SAW IT AS BILL BARR  STANDING UP TO TRUMP AND IT HAS   HELD FOR ABOUT ONE WEEK AND I 
K4FmAHkMCVA,801100,806338,THINK THAT WILL CHANGE TODAY  BECAUSE WE ARE PROBABLY GOING   TO HEAR ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE   MEMORANDUM THAT BILL BARR ISSUE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,806338,812611,"THAT WE REPORTED ON THAT  ESSENTIALLY SAID, IF THERE IS   SOME REAL, OBVIOUS INDICATIONS"
K4FmAHkMCVA,812611,819351,OF ELECTION FRAUD THAN THE DOJ  CAN INVESTIGATE IT.   WHICH MANY PEOPLE IN THE DOJ
K4FmAHkMCVA,819351,824723,PUSHED BACK AND PEOPLE DID NOT  AGREE WITH THE MEMORANDUM.
K4FmAHkMCVA,824723,832398,I THINK BILL BARR POSITIONED IT   IN THE VERY LANGUAGE OF THE   MEMO AS HE IS SLOW WALKING IS   LOOK IF HE IS DOING THE BARE
K4FmAHkMCVA,832398,838404,"MINIMUM.  I PROBABLY SHOULD LOOK INTO   THIS BUT I WILL GIVE YOU MEMO   THIS IS IF YOU SEE SOMETHING  GLARING, LOOK INTO THAT BUT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,838404,843943,"OTHERWISE, DON'T TO MATCH."
K4FmAHkMCVA,843943,849014,"IN THE GEORGIA SITUATION WITH   THE SUITCASES OF VOTES, CONDUCT   INTERVIEWS, TALK TO SOME PEOPLE   AND THEN DO THAT AND BE DONE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,849014,856689,WITH IT.  HE POSITIONED IT AS I DID THE   BARE MINIMUM AND I WASN'T   REALLY CARRYING OUT HIS ORDERS
K4FmAHkMCVA,856689,864630,BUT TODAY WE WILL HEAR A  SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT   WILL BE THE ONES WHO STOOD UP   THAT ARE GOING TO BE FOLKS LIKE   ROSEN AND DONAHUE WHO STOOD UP
K4FmAHkMCVA,864630,875507,"THE ENTIRE TIME AND NEVER GAVE  AN INCH AND WHEN IT CAME TO   THINGS LIKE SENDING OUT LETTERS   THEY SAID, WE ARE NOT DOING THAT"
K4FmAHkMCVA,875507,882548,", NO CHANCE .   >> THE PRESIDENT DID NOT GO   THROUGH.  >> HIS ALLIES WILL SAY IT AND "
K4FmAHkMCVA,882548,892424,"WE WILL HEAR FROM THOSE FOLKS .   >> IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT PURELY  LEGAL, WHERE DOES INTEND PLAY?  >> WE HAVE INCOMPLETE CRIMES"
K4FmAHkMCVA,892424,897729,LIKE ATTEMPT OR CONSPIRACY  WHERE THE ACTUAL CRIME MAY NOT  BE CARRIED OUT BUT AS A MATTER
K4FmAHkMCVA,897729,903202,OF PUBLIC POLICY WE PUNISH THE  EFFORT TO COMPLETE A CRIME AS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,903202,909341,MUCH AS WE DO THE COMPLETED 
K4FmAHkMCVA,909341,915247,CRIME.  YOU DON'T WANT TO REWARD PEOPLE   FOR BEING LOUSY AT COMMITTING   CRIMES AND MAYBE CHANGING THEIR   MINDS.  TODAY WHAT I'M GOING TO BE
K4FmAHkMCVA,915247,922921,LOOKING FOR IS THE RECKLESS   INTENT.   NOT WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS   COMPLETED BUT THE MERE FACT   THAT TRUMP ASKED AND IS TOLD
K4FmAHkMCVA,922921,931030,IT'S WRONG AND THEN APPARENTLY  ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN BASED ON  REALLY NOTHING THAT WE HAVE   SEEN OTHER THAN AND I'M QUOTING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,931030,941040,"PRIOR WITNESSES, THEORIES AND   NOT EVIDENCE.   THERE COMES A POINT WHERE   INTENT IS ASSUMED. IF SOMEONE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,941040,946745,CONTINUES ON IN THE FACE OF   KNOWLEDGE OR INFORMATION THAT   WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS WRONG  AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,946745,952918,COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO DO.  >> WHAT DID HE DO ILLEGALLY IN  THE SITUATION BECAUSE HE HAD
K4FmAHkMCVA,952918,965531,THE AUTHORITY TO HIRE AND FIRE  EVERYBODY IN THAT OVAL OFFICE.  >> THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,965531,971437,IT DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO  DEFINITIONS AND IT'S EASY FOR   SOMEONE LIKE ME TO STAND HERE   AND LOOK AT THE CRIMES CODE AND   SAY IT COULD BE CONSPIRACY TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,971437,977576,DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES OR IT   COULD BE MAIL FRAUD BECAUSE   SOMETHING WENT IN THE MAIL. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,977576,983482,BUT IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT  THING WHEN YOU HAVE AN  UNPRECEDENTED SET OF FACTS AND  TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION   AND I THINK IT'S QUITE
K4FmAHkMCVA,983482,990923,DIFFERENT AND REMINDS US BUT IT   IS FACTUALLY DIFFERENT AND I  WOULD ARGUE THE EFFORTS ARE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,990923,997463,MORE DOCUMENTED AND MORE SEVERE   THAN THEY WERE IN THE CASE OF   THE SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE AND 
K4FmAHkMCVA,997463,1003502,"YOU DON'T HAVE DOJ OFFICIALS  LEAVING, JUST THREATENING TO  LEAVE AND YOU HAVE JEFFREY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1003502,1009108,CLARK WHO IS GOING TO BE THE  FIGURE TODAY SCHEMING BEHIND TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1009108,1017816,"GET THE JOB AND GOING AT SOME   POINT TO JEFFREY ROSEN AND  SAYING, IT'S A NICE JOB YOU   HAVE AT THE DOJ AND IF YOU WANT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1017816,1023021,"TO KEEP IT, SEND OUT THESE  LETTERS AND MAYBE I DON'T WANT  THE JOB SO MUCH .   >> DO WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1023021,1029661,"WHY BILL BARR LEFT EARLY?   >> EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHY   AND WHY AT THAT MOMENT, SO  CLOSE TO THE END AND"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1029661,1036435,ESSENTIALLY MOMENTS BEFORE.   >> WE ALL WANT TO SPEND MORE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1036435,1041707,TIME WITH OUR FAMILY AND THAT'S   A FINE ENOUGH REASON BUT WHY  NOT FINISH IT OUT.  WILL WE EVER GET AN ANSWER? 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1041707,1049381,>> HE HAD ALREADY DEALT WITH  SOME OF IT.   >> THERE ARE A LOT OF MYSTERIES 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1049381,1059824,AND THIS IS ONE THAT IT FEELS   LIKE I DID NOT FEEL LIKE WE GOT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1059824,1065631,A GREAT EXPLANATION .   >> I WAS COVERING THE WHITE   HOUSE AND TALK TO PEOPLE WHO  WERE CLOSE TO BILL BARR WHERE   THE SPECULATION WAS IS HE GOING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1065631,1070802,"TO LEAVE AND THEY WOULD TELL ME   THINGS LIKE HE FEELS LIKE HE  COULD DO HIS JOB RIGHT NOW, HIS   RELATIONSHIP IS DETERIORATING "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1070802,1076108,BUT HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1076108,1081280,EXPERIENCE AND TALKED   EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE   EXPERIENCE. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1081280,1086618,>> LET'S GO TO NBC NEWS   NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT.  WE ARE GOING TO HEAR A LOT MORE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1086618,1092524,ABOUT JEFFREY CLARK AND WE  PROBABLY WON'T HEAR ABOUT THE   VISIT HE RECEIVED FROM FEDERAL
K4FmAHkMCVA,1092524,1098463,AGENTS.   >> THAT'S RIGHT.  YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW  JEFFREY CLARK AND HIS ACTIVITY
K4FmAHkMCVA,1098463,1105938,IS A CENTERPIECE OF THE HEARING   BUT WHAT WE LEARNED A FEW HOURS   AGO IS HIS HOME WAS VISITED 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1105938,1111009,YESTERDAY BY A NUMBER OF  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS
K4FmAHkMCVA,1111009,1116848,AND THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING   CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED   AND OFFICIAL SAID THERE WAS   SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1116848,1122588,IN HIS HOME BUT HIS BOSS WHO IS   A FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1122588,1129895,OFFICIAL SAID IN A STATEMENT  THAT WOULD IT WAS A PREDAWN RAID  BY A DOZEN FEDERAL AGENTS WHO   TOOK HIM OUT OF HIS HOME IN HIS 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1129895,1138536,"PAJAMAS AND SEIZED HIS  ELECTRONIC DEVICES.   THE CHARACTERIZATION, IF IT'S   CORRECT, IT SUGGESTS THAT THEY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1138536,1143775,OBTAINED A SEARCH WARRANT WHICH   MEANS I CONVINCED THE JUDGE   THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO   BELIEVE THERE WAS A CRIME   OCCURRING.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1143775,1152551,OFTEN A SEARCH WARRANT WOULD BE   SERVED IF THEY BELIEVED A   SUBJECT WAS DESTROYING EVIDENCE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1152551,1161994,THAT OTHERWISE COULD HAVE BEEN  OBTAINED BY SUBPOENA AND IT'S   HUGE DEVELOPMENT IN THE   INVESTIGATION THAT IS BEING RUN   BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1161994,1169434,INTO WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN  TERMS OF EFFORTS TO OVERTURN  THE ELECTION.   SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE ARE  GOING TO HEAR TODAY THAT ALMOST 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1169434,1176208,"EVERYTHING JEFFREY CLARK WAS  DOING AND TALKING ABOUT, HE WAS   DISCUSSING WITH THE THEN"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1176208,1181813,"PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,   DONALD TRUMP AND HAD HE   SUCCEEDED IN SOME OF THE  SCHEMES, IT COULD'VE BEEN A "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1181813,1188086,MUCH DIFFERENT RESULT AND ONE   OF THE THINGS HE WAS TRYING TO  DO WAS GET THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT TO SEND LETTERS TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1188086,1194258,STATES SAYING THE JUSTICE   DEPARTMENT HAD FOUND FRAUD IN   THE ELECTION WHICH THERE WAS NO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1194258,1200798,SUCH THING BUT HAD THE LETTERS  GONE OUT IT COULD'VE EMBOLDEN   PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO CHANGE THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1200798,1205971,GAME SO THIS IS A VERY CLOSE  CALL AND WE WILL HEAR THAT THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1205971,1212110,OFFICIALS DID THE RIGHT THING   WHEN IT MATTERED AND SAID NO  AND THREATENED TO RESIGN. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1212110,1217115,BUT THE THEORY OF THE CASE WAS  OUTLINED BY LIZ CHANEY WHEN SHE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1217115,1225157,GAVE HER DRAMATIC OPENING   STATEMENT WHICH IS THERE WAS A  CONSPIRACY HERE THAT SHE ARGUED 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1225157,1231830,WAS CRIMINAL AND USES THE WORD  CORRUPT TO OVERTHROW THE  ELECTION AND THE CONSPIRACY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1231830,1237636,STILL EXISTED AND SHOULD BE   INVESTIGATED  >> ARE THE DOJ AND THE  COMMITTEE PLAYING WELL HERE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1237636,1243207,TODAY?  >> THERE WERE SOME REPORTS IN   RECENT DAYS THAT THE DOJ WAS
K4FmAHkMCVA,1243207,1248380,ASKING FOR TRANSCRIPTS OF   COMMITTEE WITNESS TESTIMONY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1248380,1254553,THAT THE COMMITTEE DID NOT WANT   TO HAND OVER BUT MY   UNDERSTANDING IS THEY ARE   PLAYING WELL TOGETHER AND THERE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1254553,1260592,ARE A LOT OF FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS WORKING FOR THE   JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1260592,1265664,PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW THIS WORKS  AND THEY WANT TO CONDUCT A
K4FmAHkMCVA,1265664,1271103,THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BUT  DON'T WANT TO APPEAR TO BE  HIDING ANYTHING OR KEEPING  ANYTHING FROM THE JUSTICE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1271103,1278043,DEPARTMENT AND THERE ARE  LOGISTICAL ISSUES TO BE WORKED  OUT.  >> ONE OF THE SUBPLOTS IS THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1278043,1283548,"PRESSURE ON DOJ AND AS THIS   UNFOLDS, THEY LOOK TO DOJ, WHAT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1283548,1290655,ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?   >> IT HAS BEEN NOTABLE SINCE  THE START OF THE HEARINGS THAT
K4FmAHkMCVA,1290655,1297763,THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS   LET US KNOW ABOUT A BUNCH OF  NEW THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1297763,1306971,AND IS THIS A WAY FOR GARLAND   TO ANSWER THE CRITICISM HE HAS  BEEN GETTING BECAUSE ALL OF A 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1306971,1313111,SUDDEN YOU SEE SUBPOENAS BEING  ISSUED AND A PHONE BEING SEIZED.  AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1313111,1319684,"LIKE, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTIC  , SUDDENLY GETTING MORE   AGGRESSIVE AND THE REASON WHY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1319684,1325056,THE COMMITTEE IS SO FRUSTRATED  AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH  THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS THEY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1325056,1336468,FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN PEDAL TO  THE METAL.  THEY FEEL THEY HAVE FOCUSED ON
K4FmAHkMCVA,1336468,1341540,THE ACTIVE JANUARY 6 AND HAVE   BEEN AGGRESSIVE BUT THEY HAVE   SORT OF BEEN LOOKING AT THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1341540,1347178,LARGER ISSUE AND LOOKING AT THE   STUFF THAT IS NOT URGENT AND IN 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1347178,1358390,THE LAST TWO WEEKS AND HAS COME   ACROSS AS A SENSE OF URGENCY  AND I DO THINK IF YOU'RE  MERRICK GARLAND YOU WALK THROUGH
K4FmAHkMCVA,1358390,1364229,"AND IF YOU'RE EVENTUALLY GOING  TO MAKE A DECISION, WHATEVER  YOU DECIDE TO DO WITH TRUMP,  YOU BETTER HAVE EXPLORED EVERY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1364229,1370268,FACET OF THE INVESTIGATION.   IF HE'S GOING TO COME TO THE  CONCLUSION THAT HE WILL NOT   INDICT TRUMP BUT WILL INDICT
K4FmAHkMCVA,1370268,1375540,"ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND HIM, HE   NEEDS TO BE DOING WHAT WE SEE   NOW WHICH IS I LOOKED AT EVERY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1375540,1382179,AVENUE.   I CANNOT GET A PROSECUTION OF   HIM. AND THAT IS MY SENSE OF
K4FmAHkMCVA,1382179,1389087,WHAT I THINK IS THE LARGER  PICTURE . 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1389087,1395793,>> OF THE LAST HEARING GOT  EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS PERSONAL   WITH THE POLL WORKER TALKING  ABOUT BEING TARGETED BY THE   PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
K4FmAHkMCVA,1395793,1402033,AND BY CONTRAST IT FEELS LIKE   IT MAY BE MORE GRANULAR AS THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1402033,1407606,COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO RAISE  EXPECTATIONS OF QUALITY AND   INFORMATION?  >> IT SOMEWHAT OUT OF ORDER. IF 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1407606,1414279,"YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A   COURSE OF HEARINGS, I THINK IT"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1414279,1421086,WAS PLAYBOOK TODAY THAT TALKS   ABOUT IT AND WE DIPPED IN AND   OUT OF THE STORY LINE.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1421086,1428026,I DO THINK IT WILL BE MORE  GRANULAR AND FOR THOSE FOR  EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1428026,1434666,"JUSTICE WHO HAVE BEEN IN AND  OUT, IT WILL FEEL FAMILIAR AND"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1434666,1439971,I'M NOT SURE IT WILL FEEL LIKE  THAT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC WHO WILL BE   WATCHING THIS WHO MAY FOR THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1439971,1445677,FIRST TIME BE HEARING ABOUT   EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING  BEHIND THE SCENES.  I ALSO THINK TO THE POINT ABOUT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1445677,1450849,"WHAT WE MIGHT HEAR, I WOULDN'T  BE SURPRISED IF THERE WAS SOME  PERSONAL ELEMENTS BECAUSE THESE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1450849,1458890,ARE TOP DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE   OFFICIALS WHO ARE FACING  UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE AND THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1458890,1464563,ONLY POTENTIAL ANALOGY WE CAN   THINK OF DRAWING TELLS YOU HOW  SIGNIFICANT THIS WAS AND THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1464563,1470368,COMMITTEE HAS HAD AND I THROUGH   THIS ENTIRE PROCESS AND I SPOKE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1470368,1476575,"WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE   ON HOW THEY ARE LAYING THIS   OUT, THEY HAVE HAD AN EYE ON  HOW TO MAKE IT RELATABLE AND"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1476575,1482714,CONNECT TO PEOPLE WHO WERE  WATCHING.   FOR THEM IT'S ABOUT SITTING   DOWN AN ACCURATE RECORD OF  HISTORY AS THEY SEE IT WITH A 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1482714,1488486,LOT OF CONCERT CONVERSATIONS  AND I DO THINK THERE MAY BE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1488486,1494759,"SOME EMOTIONAL PIECES, WHAT WAS   IT LIKE FOR JEFF ROSEN WITH   DONALD TRUMP UNTIL HIM WHAT YOU "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1494759,1503534,ARE DOING IS SO WRONG THAT I  MAY LEAVE AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE  FOR THE OTHER WITNESSES.  >> WE ENDED THE LAST HEARING ON 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1503534,1512344,"THE LITTLE BIT -- WHITE HOUSE   LAWYER, WE WERE LEFT WITH A "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1512344,1518350,"CLIFFHANGER.  LIZ CHANEY SAYING, IF YOU HEAR  ME, COME TESTIFY. "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1518350,1523988,CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT IT  SOUNDS LIKE WE MAY SEE A VISION 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1523988,1530395,OF HIM TODAY.   IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1530395,1536167,MOMENT.   >> INTENTIONALLY. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1536167,1543108,WE KNOW THAT WE FEEL CONFIDENT  THAT WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT  THE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THE   WITNESSES WERE IN THE   CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AND WE   TALKED ABOUT HOW MORE THAN
K4FmAHkMCVA,1543108,1549247,OTHERS HAD CLAIMED EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE AND DID WORK AT THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1549247,1554419,WHITE HOUSE AND CANNOT ACCOUNT  FOR IT. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1554419,1561760,IF AS YOU SAY JEFFREY CLARK IS  KIND OF THE SECTOR OF THE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1561760,1569867,"CHARACTER HANGING OVER THIS, I  THINK HE IS UP THERE AS WELL.   >> SEAN PENN IS IN THE GALLERY. "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1569867,1575540,LET'S GO BACK TO OUR SENIOR   CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT.   TALK ABOUT THE LAST MINUTE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1575540,1584282,DELAY FOR FUTURE HEARINGS.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1584282,1589820,>> WE WERE EXPECTING A FULL   SLATE OF HEARINGS THAT THE  COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN HAS SAID DUE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1589820,1595527,TO AN INFLUX IN NEW INFORMATION   AND NEW EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1595527,1603134,GOING TO DELAY UNTIL THE MIDDLE   OF JULY THE FINAL TWO HEARINGS  THAT WE KNOW THEY WERE  PLANNING.   AND THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1603134,1610075,HEARINGS BEYOND THAT SO SOME OF   THIS IS NEW EVIDENCE AND SOME   IS EVIDENCE THEY WANT TO GET. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1610075,1615747,AND THERE'S A PIECE OF EVIDENCE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1615747,1622187,THE COMMITTEE IS STILL SEEKING  BUT WE KNOW IN RECENT DAYS THEY   HAVE GONE THERE HANDS ON QUITE  A LOT OF VIDEO FROM A 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1622187,1630662,DOCUMENTARIAN NAMED ALEX HOLDER   A BRITISH DOCUMENTARIAN AND   FILMMAKER EMBEDDED IN THE TRUMP 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1630662,1635800,WHITE HOUSE AND TRUMP CAMPAIGN  AND YOU SEE SOME OF THE VIDEO   THAT HE HAS RELEASED IN RECENT  DAYS AND HE CAME IN FOR A 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1635800,1642440,DEPOSITION TODAY AND IT WAS   ONLY TWO HOURS AND THAT TELLS   ME THEY WANT THE VIDEO MORE   THAN THEY WANT TO TALK TO HIM.  WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1642440,1648045,HAS ONLY THAT HE'S GOT
K4FmAHkMCVA,1648045,1654919,INTERVIEWS WITH TRUMP AND TRUMP   FAMILY MEMBERS FROM BEFORE AND  AFTER THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6   AND THE COMMITTEE THINKS IT   MIGHT SHED NEW LIGHT. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1654919,1660491,AND HE HAS MISSED NO  OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIS  DOCUMENTARY AND WE ARE ALL
K4FmAHkMCVA,1660491,1667799,WAITING QUITE EAGERLY TOEE  WHAT IF ANY NEW LIKE THE VIDEO  SHEDS BUT THE COMMITTEE   BELIEVES THAT SIGNIFICANT.  >> THE WITNESSES WE HAVE SEEN 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1667799,1676174,OUR REPUBLICAN WITNESSES WHO  MAY IN FACT BE MORE DAMAGING
K4FmAHkMCVA,1676174,1684115,"AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AS THEY   CONTINUE TO MAKE A CASE, THE  HIGHLY RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE   REPUBLICAN PARTY AND TODAY WE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1684115,1689854,WILL SEE THE FORMER TOP JUSTICE   DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TALK ABOUT   THE PRESSURE THEY SAY THEY WERE   UNDER TO GO ALONG WITH THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,1689854,1695026,PRESIDENT'S SCHEME. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1695026,1702400,>> I DO THINK THAT THE RICHARD
K4FmAHkMCVA,1702400,1709574,DONOGHUE TESTIMONY WILL BE  FASCINATING.  I'M CURIOUS WHETHER WE WILL GET   SOME FOLLOW-UP. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1709574,1715113,WE WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE   LAST HEARING THAT IT FELT LIKE  THEY LEAVE STUFF OUT THERE AND
K4FmAHkMCVA,1715113,1721552,"YOU'RE LIKE, DRAW THAT OUT A  LITTLE MORE OR TELL US A LITTLE   MORE.   >> WITH THE SCRIPTED NATURE OF"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1721552,1727258,THE QUESTIONS?  >> IT FEELS LIKE IT'S SCRIPTED  ANSWERS AT TIMES. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1727258,1733331,"THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO GET   OUT OF IT AND YOU'RE LIKE,  FINISH THAT THOUGHT AND I WOULD "
K4FmAHkMCVA,1733331,1742941,LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THAT WENT .  >> SOME OF IT FEELS   INTENTIONAL.  WE MAY HEAR ABOUT SOMEONE WHO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1742941,1747979,WAS SYMPATHETIC TO THE PRESIDENT  CLAIMING LIVES OF ELECTION  FRAUD AND THAT GOT DROPPED
K4FmAHkMCVA,1747979,1753184,EARLY AND SORT OF WENT NOWHERE  THAT HE HAD ASKED FOR A QUOTE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1753184,1758890,AND SOMETHING THAT THE OFFICE   DENIES AND I'M WONDERING IF   TODAY IS THE DAY WE WILL HEAR   MORE ABOUT THAT.
K4FmAHkMCVA,1758890,1764495,>> SOME OF THAT IS THE REASON 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1764495,1769767,AND THERE IS ANOTHER REASON FOR   THE DELAY.  NEXT WEEK COULD HAVE THE MOST   CONSEQUENTIAL OF THE SUPREME
K4FmAHkMCVA,1769767,1775740,COURT DECISION IN TWO DECADES   AND I DO THINK THEY WANT TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1775740,1781913,STEER CLEAR   >> WITH THEY WANT THE NARRATIVE   TO BE COHESIVE? 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1781913,1788519,">> AT THE COMBINATION, THEY ARE   GETTING MORE INFORMATION AND  YOU HEARD THEM SAY WE WANT TO   MAKE SURE THAT THE HEARING"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1788519,1793758,LIVES UP TO THE SAME QUALITY  THAT WE DELIVERED SO FAR.   BUT NEXT WEEK ALSO COMES WITH 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1793758,1799797,THAT  AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
K4FmAHkMCVA,1799797,1807572,"DO THAT.  ALSO, I THINK -- THEY WERE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,1807572,1812610,HOPING THEY COULD SOMEHOW   CONVINCE HIM TO DO THIS.  IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1812610,1819851,>> THE WITNESSES ARE RESPECTING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1819851,1826391,THIS SESSION.   IT IS SET TO BEGIN IN JUST A  MOMENT.   WE WILL PAUSE BRIEFLY AND GET 
K4FmAHkMCVA,1826391,1836167,OUR STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY   A CHANCE TO JOIN OUR NETWORK  SPECIAL REPORT COVERAGE.

K4FmAHkMCVA,1937869,1943674,SOMETIME NEXT MONTH.  WHY?
K4FmAHkMCVA,1943674,1949613,IT IS WHEN THEY CALL IT A   MOUNTAIN OF NEW INFORMATION   CENTERED ON HOW THE FORMER  PRESIDENT DIRECTED PROTESTERS

K4FmAHkMCVA,2088451,2094357,DONALD TRUMP DID NOT JUST WANT  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO   INVESTIGATE.  HE WANTED THE JUSTICE   DEPARTMENT TO HELP LEGITIMIZE

K4FmAHkMCVA,5485012,5491552,CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU MEANT  BY THAT?  >> I HAD TO READ BOTH THE EMAIL 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5491552,5500828,AND THE ATTACHED LETTER TRIES   TO MAKE SURE I REALLY   UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS  PROPOSING BECAUSE IT WAS SO   EXTREME TO ME. I HAD A HARD

K4FmAHkMCVA,5519046,5526420,I KNEW WE WOULD BOTH HAVE A   SIMILAR REACTION TO IT.   HE WAS NOT IN HIS OFFICE.   I RETURNED TO MY OFFICE AND SAT

K4FmAHkMCVA,5546207,5551946,THIS WAS ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO   THE FACT AS DEVELOPED BY
K4FmAHkMCVA,5551946,5557218,DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATIONS OVER  THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND  MONTHS. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5557218,5562322,"THE RESPONSE TO THAT, AND FOR   THE DEPARTMENT TO INSERT ITSELF   INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS THIS   WAY I THINK WOULD HAVE HAD  GRAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,5562322,5569430,COUNTRY.  IT MAY VERY WELL HAVE SPIRALED
K4FmAHkMCVA,5569430,5574468,US INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL  CRISIS.   I WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE  UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE   SITUATION BECAUSE HE DIDN'T   SEEM TO REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

K4FmAHkMCVA,5586213,5591785,I WENT TO HIS OFFICE.   HE HAD JUST READ IT.  HE HAD A VERY SIMILAR REACTION  TO ME.  HE WAS EXASPERATED AND TOLD ME

K4FmAHkMCVA,5638999,5644238,WE HAD A SUBSEQUENT MEETING AND   CONVERSATION. THE ACTING AG   PROBABLY HAD MORE CONTACT WITH

K4FmAHkMCVA,5650076,5655916,ANOTHER IN PERSON MEETING.  HE CLEARLY CONTINUED TO MOVE  DOWN THIS PATH.   HE BEGAN CALLING WITNESSES AND
K4FmAHkMCVA,5655916,5661956,CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS OF  HIS OWN. HE GOT A BRIEFING FROM 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5661956,5667061,DNI ABOUT REPORTED FOREIGN
K4FmAHkMCVA,5667061,5672299,INTELLIGENCE INTERFERENCE.  AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS ONCE IT  WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THERE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5672299,5679006,"WAS NO BASIS FOR THAT PART OF   HIS CONCERN THAT HE WOULD   RETREAT, BUT INSTEAD, HE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,5679006,5685613,"DOUBLED DOWN AND SAID, WELL,  OKAY, SO THERE IS NO FOR  INTERFERENCE.   I STILL THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH"
K4FmAHkMCVA,5685613,5691452,"ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE THAT WE   SHOULD GO AHEAD AND SEND THIS   LETTER, WHICH SHOCKED ME EVEN   MORE THAN THE INITIAL ONE."
K4FmAHkMCVA,5691452,5697758,"YOU WOULD THINK AFTER A COUPLE  OF DAYS OF LOOKING AT THIS THAT   HE, LIKE WE, WOULD HAVE COME TO "

K4FmAHkMCVA,5704632,5710437,>> YES.   >> WHAT WAS HIS REACTION?   >> HE GOT VERY DEFENSIVE. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5710437,5715876,"AS I SAID, THERE WERE A SERIES  OF CONVERSATIONS THROUGH THAT   WEEK.   I REMEMBER VERY SPECIFICALLY  THE CONVERSATION, THE MEETING "
K4FmAHkMCVA,5715876,5724418,ON JANUARY 2nd.   THAT GOT EVEN MORE  CONFRONTATIONAL.  HE WAS DEFENSIVE. AND SIMILAR 
K4FmAHkMCVA,5724418,5729423,TO HIS EARLIER REACTION WHEN I  SAID THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN

K4FmAHkMCVA,10517807,10524080,DOZENS AND DOZENS OF TIMES.   HE LOST IN PART BECAUSE THERE   WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT VOTER

K4FmAHkMCVA,11773861,11779567,"BUT THE BIG THING THAT HAPPENED   TODAY WAS THIS CONSPIRACY,"
K4FmAHkMCVA,11779567,11784739,WHICH WAS SHOWN TO BE SOLD  CALLING AND INVOLVING SO MANY   OTHERS. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11784739,11790077,THE REALLY BIG THING ABOUT  THESE IS WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11790077,11795083,THAT CAUSED THEM TO SAY I WANT
K4FmAHkMCVA,11795083,11802290,"A PARDON.   SO IT'S THE CONDUCT AND THE WAY   IN WHICH SCOTT PERRY, WE KNOW "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11802290,11837358,ABOUT SPECIFICALLY.   THE ACTUAL PLAN HAS THEM DEEPLY   INVOLVED IN TRYING TO DO WHAT   IS PLAINLY A CRIME.
K4FmAHkMCVA,11837358,11845400,"THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS, AFTER   BEING TOLD BY HIS BOSS AT THE   TIME, TECHNICALLY STILL HIS "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11845400,11850605,BOSS.   THAT HE WAS OUT OF LINE HERE. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11850605,11856444,"HE CONTINUED TO MAKE CALLS, HE  ASKED FOR A BRIEFING FROM   INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS.   DOES JEFFREY CLARK HAVE ANY   LEGAL LIABILITY HERE? "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11856444,11862216,">> BIG TIME, HE IS ALSO A "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11862216,11869557,"COOPERATING WITNESS.  ESSENTIALLY A NON-ENTITY, HE  DOESN'T REALLY GO VERY HIGH."
K4FmAHkMCVA,11869557,11876798,"TRUMP IS ANY PORT IN A STORM,   SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE AGREES"
K4FmAHkMCVA,11876798,11885373,TO LET HIMSELF BE USED IN THIS  LIE.  THIS ONE LEFT ME COMPLETELY 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11885373,11891746,"BREATHLESS, BECAUSE IT WAS SO   CLOSE.  EVERYWHERE ELSE, HE IS CRAWLING   AROUND, OING WHATEVER HE CAN. "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11891746,11898786,"THIS WAS THE WIDTH OF THE   PAPER.  THAT PAPER GOES OUT, PEOPLE IN  GEORGIA AND OTHER STATES SAY"
K4FmAHkMCVA,11898786,11904192,"THEY THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM,   AND YOU CAN REALLY SEE HOW THE  DOMINOES AT THAT POINT WOULD  HAVE FALLEN AND WOULD HAVE LEFT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11904192,11911032,HIM POTENTIALLY IN POWER. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11911032,11918406,>> WE SAW THEM PULLING ALL THE
K4FmAHkMCVA,11918406,11923711,"FIRE ALARMS.  THE NEXT LEVEL OF DEPARTMENT OF   JUSTICE, BASICALLY TAKE A ROLL  CALL AND SAY IF I JUMP, YOU "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11923711,11929484,JUMP.   THEY ALL AGREE THAT THEY WERE   OUT IF HE CAME INTO PLAY. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11929484,11939594,"CRITICALLY, THIS PIECE OF NEWS  THAT WE GOT TODAY, SEVERAL  AUTHORITIES WERE AT CLARK'S "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11939594,11948169,"HOUSE.  >> ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THEY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11948169,11954242,"CONDUCTED A SEARCH, THEY TOOK   HIM OUT OF HIS HOUSE IN HIS   PAJAMAS AND SEIZED HIS  ELECTRONIC DEVICES.   WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THEY HAD A"
K4FmAHkMCVA,11954242,11959480,"WARRANT, THEY CONVINCED THE   JUDGE THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE  TO BELIEVE A CRIME HAD BEEN   COMMITTED."
K4FmAHkMCVA,11959480,11967188,USUALLY THEY DO THAT WHEN THEY  BELIEVE A WITNESS IS TRYING TO  HIDE EVIDENCE OR NOT SUBMIT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11967188,11974562,"DOCUMENTS.  I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HARRY,  THAT HEARING TODAY WAS  BREATHTAKING.   BECAUSE OF HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO   AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER. "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11974562,11980101,THE LETTER TO THE GEORGIA 
K4FmAHkMCVA,11980101,11987075,"LEGISLATURE THAT WAS THE WHOLE  PURPOSE OF THIS CONSPIRACY,   THAT TRUMP WANTED THE DOJ TO  SEND OUT SAYING THAT THEY HAD   FOUND FRAUD WHEN IN FACT THEY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,11987075,11992847,HAD NOT.  IT WAS A DAGGER AIMED AT THE  HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY.   THERE LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN  CIVIL UNREST THAT MADE JANUARY
K4FmAHkMCVA,11992847,12000388,6th LOOK LIKE A PICNIC.   THE ONLY REASON IT DIDN'T   HAPPEN IS BECAUSE COURAGEOUS
K4FmAHkMCVA,12000388,12006460,"PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM APPOINTED  BY TRUMP, STOOD UP AND SAID WE  ARE NOT DOING THIS.   WE WANT NO PART OF THIS.  AND WE WILL RESIGN IF YOU TRY "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12006460,12015202,TO APPOINT THIS GUY.  I AM HIS STANDING IN FRONT OF 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12015202,12020808,"THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, I  ALWAYS WATCH THESE WITH AN EYE  TO WHAT THE PROSECUTORS ARE   GETTING OUT OF THIS.  IF THEY EVER DO BRING A CASE"
K4FmAHkMCVA,12020808,12025979,"AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, A LOT OF  THE TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE WE   HEARD WILL BE A BIG PART OF IT.   ONE THING THE HEARING DID NOT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12025979,12032987,FALL IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER   DONALD TRUMP HAD CRIMINAL   INTENT.   WHAT WE NEVER HEARD FROM THOSE  WITNESSES WAS ANYBODY SAYING
K4FmAHkMCVA,12032987,12038159,DONALD TRUMP KNEW HE WAS LYING.   HE TOLD US HE KNEW HE WANTED TO 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12038159,12044432,ASSERT THESE CLAIMS ANYWAYS.  THAT WILL BE ACCUSED OF 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12044432,12051472,EVIDENCE.   >> THANK YOU.   LET ME BRING IN CHUCK TODD. 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12051472,12061215,"I KNOW THAT ONE OF YOUR BIG   TAKEAWAYS, THE SHEER SCOPE OF "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12061215,12069123,WHAT WE SAW UNFOLD AS IT  RELATED TO THIS PRESSURE  CAMPAIGN ON THE DOJ.  TO TRY TO INSTALL A LOYALIST AT 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12069123,12074161,"THE TOP.  YOU HAVE 1 MILLION NAMES,   TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE,"
K4FmAHkMCVA,12074161,12084838,"WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW COMING   OUT OF THIS?  >> TODAY WAS THE DAY THAT WE  LEARNED HOW OPERATIONAL, WHAT "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12084838,12092213,THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO DO.   HE WAS TRYING TO CREATE 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12092213,12098319,LEGITIMACY.   THIS REALLY WAS A MULTIFACETED
K4FmAHkMCVA,12098319,12105259,"ATTEMPT.  THEY STARTED AT THE COURTS,   THEN THEY REALIZED THEY NEEDED"
K4FmAHkMCVA,12105259,12113901,COVER.  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WAS THE  BEST PLACE TO GET COVER.
K4FmAHkMCVA,12113901,12120942,IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT BILL   BARR DIDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF
K4FmAHkMCVA,12120942,12127782,"THIS, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE IN   THIS SITUATION WHERE THEY ENDED "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12127782,12133087,"UP WITH A LOYALIST, THE "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12133087,12138292,"CONGRESSMAN SCOTT PERRY, IT'S   LIKE THE PRESIDENT HAD HIS OWN"
K4FmAHkMCVA,12138292,12145066,SORT OF TEAM TRYING TO MANEUVER 
K4FmAHkMCVA,12145066,12153307,"AROUND FOLKS LIKE MR. ROSEN,  THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL,  THE GUESTS -- I GUESS THE WAY I "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12153307,12158712,"WOULD DESCRIBE IT, THIS WORD  HAS GOTTEN TURNED AROUND TOO"
K4FmAHkMCVA,12158712,12163884,"MUCH, CLUE, BUT TODAY WAS THE   DAY WHERE WE WERE RIGHT AT AN   OPERATIONAL LEVEL."
K4FmAHkMCVA,12163884,12170457,"AND IN THAT MEETING, PRESIDENT  TRUMP DECIDED NO, I AM FINE YOU   GUYS, AND THEN THAT LETTER GOES "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12170457,12176130,"OUT, AND WHILE THE LETTER   ITSELF, IT WILL GET CONVOLUTED, "
K4FmAHkMCVA,12176130,12183638,IT'S THE LETTERHEAD.  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WEIGHED
K4FmAHkMCVA,12183638,12194982,"IN.   THAT WOULD HAVE HAD AN IMPACT,  IT WOULD HAVE CREATED PHONY   LEGITIMACY.   IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE "
