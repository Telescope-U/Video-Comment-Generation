pBWp7sZG66o,210720,218080,with that particular meeting is he  trying to rally support at a time when  he's lost so many mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,220640,227280,yes absolutely like you how you rightly  put it the idea is not just to  gather the mlas and you know find
pBWp7sZG66o,227280,234400,support once again from these rebel mla  but also the fact that these are some  face saving moments at the last minute
pBWp7sZG66o,234400,241519,they're going to try and swing whatever  is possible in their favor and save  their mba government from toppling down
pBWp7sZG66o,241519,246640,but also he said that the bjp is highly  invested in finishing of the shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,246640,254159,at all costs this is what uttar takri  said in an emotional appeal through a  video message yesterday also his son
pBWp7sZG66o,254159,259359,who was uh  who is believed to be the environment  minister uh the tourism minister and

pBWp7sZG66o,277120,283759,in marine lines area of south mumbai  also the majority of the people that are  believed to be attending uh the meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,283759,290800,today evening is going to be from south  mumbai because like i mentioned that he  has from the worly constituency so that
pBWp7sZG66o,290800,297919,is where he has also found maximum  support given the kind of efforts that  he has taken to develop that area uh uh
pBWp7sZG66o,297919,304000,you know uh also one more thing ramda  saturday later during the day today he  is going to be meeting the former chief
pBWp7sZG66o,304000,309039,minister mr devin rafadnavis ram the  saturday's republican party of india was
pBWp7sZG66o,309039,315440,also formerly a coalition partner at a  time when even the pharmacist was the  chief minister of maharashtra but
pBWp7sZG66o,315440,322880,however uttar takri and his son are  doing everything possible that they can  to try and mobilize support and ensure
pBWp7sZG66o,322880,328880,that the government uh is you know  somewhere stopped and they can arrest  this toppling down of their government
pBWp7sZG66o,328880,336240,uh also what they believe that the bjp  is playing very in a foul manner and is  using every dirty tactic in the textbook
pBWp7sZG66o,336240,341840,to try and throw them out of power so  these are the kind of updates that we  have for now but of course later during
pBWp7sZG66o,341840,347039,the day we will be bringing more to you  akshata dave just stay on with me  because one of the big updates that's
pBWp7sZG66o,347039,353600,coming which will be deemed as a win of  sorts for udav takri is the fact that  the deputy speaker of maharashtra has
pBWp7sZG66o,353600,361039,accepted the play of the uddhav sena and  is set to summon the rebel mlas the  deputy speaker will serve notices to all
pBWp7sZG66o,361039,366479,16 rebel mls today's work sources have  told us these rebels will be given an
pBWp7sZG66o,366479,374319,opportunity to put out their version of  events but they will have to submit the  same by 5 p.m tomorrow by jul 5 p.m on
pBWp7sZG66o,374319,380319,june 26th now according to sources  emilies will be asked to also be present  physically in the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,380319,385840,legislative assembly these mlas as per  the 10th schedule can be disqualified if
pBWp7sZG66o,385840,391120,they give up membership of the party or  join another party similarly if they  vote or abstain from voting in
pBWp7sZG66o,391120,397600,contradiction to the party they can face  disqualification the exception to that  rule is if two thirds of the party
pBWp7sZG66o,397600,402880,decides to rebel and that's clearly  what's happened here with ethnic
pBWp7sZG66o,402880,405880,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,417840,420840,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,515440,521279,so the deputy speaker in the absence of  a speaker in maharashtra has all the  powers now to decide on the
pBWp7sZG66o,521279,528240,disqualification of these mlas he'll act  as per the tenth schedule uh and we're  going to explain to you exactly what
pBWp7sZG66o,528240,534800,that states with regards to  disqualification does eknot shinde now  face being disqualified along with all
pBWp7sZG66o,534800,541200,the other rebel mlas whose names udav  takre has mentioned in that particular  list let's explain to you what the 10th
pBWp7sZG66o,541200,548399,schedule exactly says on what grounds  can an mla be disqualified number one if  an mla gives up membership of the party
pBWp7sZG66o,548399,554000,voluntarily or joins another party then  he or she can be disqualified similarly
pBWp7sZG66o,554000,560640,if they choose to vote or abstain from  voting also in contradiction to the  party stand and in contradiction to the
pBWp7sZG66o,560640,568240,whip issued by the party they can face  disqualification now the exception to  this rule is that if two-thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,568240,575040,party decides to switch like in the case  of ignatinde they could save themselves  from disqualification that's why we kept
pBWp7sZG66o,575040,581040,saying that aka shinde needed the number  37 he's reached it so he's effectively  got two third of the party strength in
pBWp7sZG66o,581040,587360,the house with him in which case he  saves himself from disqualification  which is why it's interesting to see
pBWp7sZG66o,587360,594320,what the deputy speaker will do next let  me take this back across to dave kotak  for the updates on this they've uh you
pBWp7sZG66o,594320,599680,know this is a very complicated scenario  according to the 10th schedule the only  exception is if two thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,599680,606320,party's strength goes and rebels decides  to switch which is what's happened with  eight not shinde but the deputy speaker
pBWp7sZG66o,606320,612959,choosing we're being told to issue a  notice to these rebel mlas sixteen of  them including eiknard shinde now one of
pBWp7sZG66o,612959,620000,the questions that keeps coming up here  is that iknow shinde claims he has a  support of 37 plus shiv cena mlas why is
pBWp7sZG66o,620000,625199,it that only 16 have been named by the  udhav cena
pBWp7sZG66o,628000,634880,well these 16 rebel mlas who are being  spoken about and are in question right  now uh you know uh
pBWp7sZG66o,634880,641839,they are believed to be from ekna  shinde's camp and they're currently  based in guwahati uh also one more
pBWp7sZG66o,641839,646800,important thing is that maharashtra's  advocate general
pBWp7sZG66o,648240,653760,has also been consulted in this matter  to try and ascertain and determine the  fact in terms of how the
pBWp7sZG66o,653760,659519,disqualification procedure will play out  to be so that is why the question is of
pBWp7sZG66o,659519,665680,um these 16 rebel mlas who who firstly  went incognito and later once contact
pBWp7sZG66o,665680,671760,was established with them it was later  realized that they had already switched  over of course they continued to remain
pBWp7sZG66o,671760,677600,in the shape cena as well this is  something that utah chakra also said  that he is seeking disqualification of
pBWp7sZG66o,677600,682800,these mlas so uh you know as as per the  legal procedure the advocate general
pBWp7sZG66o,682800,689279,later during the day will also advise in  terms of how this procedure can work out  to be you know maintaining the law book
pBWp7sZG66o,689279,696240,at all points in time and ramdas  attorney once he comes to mr devin rafa  versus bungalow yeah at nepenthe road we
pBWp7sZG66o,696240,701279,will also try and speak to him and  understand  in terms of how he brings the support to
pBWp7sZG66o,701279,708399,the table and what kind of support he  brings more importantly and also how big  a role will he himself be playing in the
pBWp7sZG66o,708399,714959,new government's formation if that at  all  happens in the first place unless the  mva government remains which at this
pBWp7sZG66o,714959,722160,point in time seems very uh unlikely uh  given the kind of numbers that are not  favoring them at all so you know these
pBWp7sZG66o,722160,729360,are the kind of uh points that we need  to keep in mind and consider uh you know  before we move ahead of in terms of any
pBWp7sZG66o,729360,734560,kind of discussions with the  disqualification or the formation of the  new government that's concerned you know
pBWp7sZG66o,734560,740160,as far as the numbers goed up seems to  have recognized and acknowledged that  they're not with him which is why he's
pBWp7sZG66o,740160,746720,now taking this forward as a legal  battle as well they stay on with us i  want to break down for our viewers what
pBWp7sZG66o,746720,752720,happens next with regards to the  legalities the assembly the floor test  etc remember that in maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,752720,759279,currently there is no speaker in the  assembly no speaker has been chosen so  in such a circumstance it's very clear
pBWp7sZG66o,759279,766560,that the deputy speaker has all the  powers that a speaker normally has so  the deputy speaker will finally take the
pBWp7sZG66o,766560,771600,decision on whether to disqualify mlas  or to split cena two petitions lie in
pBWp7sZG66o,771600,777519,front of him so far we're being told  that he's going to summon the rebels uh  with regards to the disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,777519,784399,notice the decision of the deputy  speaker will be final will be binding  yes if for example it's against the shin
pBWp7sZG66o,784399,789519,they say now they can approach the  courts but the courts also restrict  themselves on how much power they have
pBWp7sZG66o,789519,795200,in these kind of cases particularly  where the tenth schedule is consent let  me bring in paula me sahab she's joining
pBWp7sZG66o,795200,802000,us live from guwahati with more on the  story as well follow me good morning a  lot of questions about what shinde cena
pBWp7sZG66o,802000,808880,strategy is going to be here they have  suffered a setback in the sense that the  deputy speaker has decided to act on
pBWp7sZG66o,808880,815200,udav takaray's plea to disqualify mlas  they could be summoned today so are we  finally going to be seeing eight not
pBWp7sZG66o,815200,820720,shinde and a handful of his mlas making  their way to mumbai
pBWp7sZG66o,823440,830320,um akshata good morning to you as well  uh as far as not shinde camp's strategy  is concerned that of course is not known
pBWp7sZG66o,830320,836560,at the moment but yes they will be  compelled by the deputy speaker to  appear before him in the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,836560,842399,legislative assembly in order to put  forth their side of  uh the story obviously the
pBWp7sZG66o,842399,850079,disqualification notice which has been  moved against them at least 16 rebel  mlas by the shivsena party uh that is
pBWp7sZG66o,850079,856480,going to be very crucial yesterday iknow  shinde had stepped out of the guardi  hotel radisson blue uh for about three
pBWp7sZG66o,856480,862720,hours we believe that he was seeking a  legal advice he may have been in  meetings which was basically to uh
pBWp7sZG66o,862720,868800,strategize his further course offer  action he does know that much of this  battle is going to end up in courtrooms
pBWp7sZG66o,868800,874959,right now because it is about uh what  the law says really what does the  anti-defection law or the ten schedule
pBWp7sZG66o,874959,881680,or for the indian constitution say and  whether he indeed he and his colleagues  15 other colleagues can be disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,881680,887360,for not attending a party meeting which  was called by uh the whip that has been
pBWp7sZG66o,887360,893360,issued by the shiv sena party in mumbai  he of course has  sent in a resolution to the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,893360,899120,speaker copy of which has gone to the  legislative secretary to the governor as  well saying these are the 37 mlas with
pBWp7sZG66o,899120,906240,me and we are the legislative party of  the shiv cena the leader of our party is  not shinde our chief whip is bharat
pBWp7sZG66o,906240,913040,gogable so um they are of course digging  their heels in but this is going to be a  legal battle eventually and it could end
pBWp7sZG66o,913040,920320,up in a courtroom it remains to be seen  if they move the courts if at all or the  deputy speaker you know proceeds forward
pBWp7sZG66o,920320,926800,and goes ahead and disqualifies them  remember that they've also moved a  motion for the removal of the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,926800,932079,speaker as well on the 21st of june  because of the deputy speaker's decision
pBWp7sZG66o,932079,937279,to accept uh the shiv sena's call to  remove eichnacht india as the leader of
pBWp7sZG66o,937279,944480,the legislative party and  appoint ajay chaudhary in his place so  one resolution moved by the shinde camp
pBWp7sZG66o,944480,951519,and two resolution moved by independent  mlas who two of them who are said to be  close to the bjp who again moved to no
pBWp7sZG66o,951519,957600,confidence motion against the deputy  speaker naruto yesterday saying that he
pBWp7sZG66o,957600,964639,cannot go ahead and disqualify these  mlas first he has to see the numbers so  uh putting the deputy speaker in a bind
pBWp7sZG66o,964639,970880,as well because the law says if there is  a no confidence motion against the  speaker slash the deputy speaker they
pBWp7sZG66o,970880,976000,are not in a qualified position to  disqualify others because they're  members of the legislative assembly as
pBWp7sZG66o,976000,982079,well what's very clear going by what  uddhav senator shinde sena is doing is  that this is going to be a long drawn
pBWp7sZG66o,982079,988079,battle and as you have said before it's  a three-fold one it's playing out with  regards to the numbers in the assembly
pBWp7sZG66o,988079,993920,in the courts and will eventually also  go to the election commission as well  paul me stay on with me request there
pBWp7sZG66o,993920,999759,also to stay on with us because we're  getting in a news break also what's  expected later today
pBWp7sZG66o,1005440,1012160,a slew of meetings lined up today  devendra patnavis is going to be meeting  with all of the bjp's allies in
pBWp7sZG66o,1012160,1018480,maharashtra uh ramdas zartavla union  minister will also be there for that  meeting that's expected to happen at 11
pBWp7sZG66o,1018480,1025839,this morning the cena national executive  meet is going to be happening at one  this afternoon aditya takari will be
pBWp7sZG66o,1025839,1031038,holding a public address at 6 30 this  evening so every camp going ahead with
pBWp7sZG66o,1031038,1039038,their own plans with their own huddles  with their own meetings to see how they  can emerge victor in this battle in this
pBWp7sZG66o,1039038,1045438,game of thrones that's playing out in  maharashtra  let's take this back across to dave
pBWp7sZG66o,1045438,1051520,kotak as well they've you know a lot of  questions about what udav takara  strategy is going to be we got a glimpse
pBWp7sZG66o,1051520,1057039,of what they plan to do with sanjay  route yesterday saying that we're ready  now for the legal battle is that the
pBWp7sZG66o,1057039,1063039,only hope right now for the target that  the deputy speaker kind of rules in his  favor considering he's lost out the
pBWp7sZG66o,1063039,1069840,numbers now  yes absolutely uh
pBWp7sZG66o,1069840,1076960,you know going through the legal way is  one of the strongest way where he can  assure any kind of support uh at this
pBWp7sZG66o,1076960,1083280,point in time given the fact that he  clearly lacks the numbers also those 37  rebel mlas who are camping in guwahati
pBWp7sZG66o,1083280,1089280,have clearly gone on to state the fact  that  the group legislature party head
pBWp7sZG66o,1089280,1096400,continues to remain eknath shinde and  also at a time when uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,1096400,1102400,ignacion they had clearly specified and  gone on to state that no one has been in  touch with them to try and
pBWp7sZG66o,1102400,1108080,address their concerns that they have in  this point in time or even remotely try  to sort out the kind of demands that
pBWp7sZG66o,1108080,1115280,they were making so uh you know we have  to although we have to clearly try and  understand the fact that uh udder is
pBWp7sZG66o,1115280,1121760,also trying every book in the trick and  adopting every firefighting method also  we know parallely that his son aditya
pBWp7sZG66o,1121760,1129600,takri has also been trying to rally  support to save this government from  really toppling over and ensure that you
pBWp7sZG66o,1129600,1136400,know a bjp's chief ministerial candidate  does not  come to you know come to power so yeah
pBWp7sZG66o,1136400,1143679,of course we also know for a matter of  fact that these 37 uh rebel mlas are  also trying to oust the deputy speaker
pBWp7sZG66o,1143679,1149760,nara  zarwal as well so uh you know we will  also have to try and wait
pBWp7sZG66o,1149760,1155760,for the kind of suggestions and the  recommendations that will be given later  during the day okay by the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,1155760,1162960,advocate general mr ashitosh kumbakoni  regarding the disqualification process  and procedure but however the chief
pBWp7sZG66o,1162960,1169679,minister uttar takari is clearly hurt  and upset because he through the video  conference appeal also said that
pBWp7sZG66o,1169679,1175919,the amongst these rebel mlas  you know they are being very thankless  these were people who were not even
pBWp7sZG66o,1175919,1183039,considered initially when true shifts nx  were being considered to be given the  poll ticket and uh you know when they
pBWp7sZG66o,1183039,1188080,had stronger chances they made uh sure  that these rebel mlas were given tickets
pBWp7sZG66o,1188080,1193919,and they won because of the kind of  power  you know because of the kind of name  that shield cena has in the state so
pBWp7sZG66o,1193919,1199520,these are some thankless and ungrateful  people who did not value the poll  tickets so uttar thakur is clearly
pBWp7sZG66o,1199520,1206880,miffed and sort of upset in a way if i  can say so by the by the series of  events and the political drama that has
pBWp7sZG66o,1206880,1213840,played out in the state and uh you know  in the last few days it has definitely  left him in a really worried state yes
pBWp7sZG66o,1213840,1219760,and you know the talker has chosen to  blame the bjp but the reality is that  there are more than just a handful of
pBWp7sZG66o,1219760,1226400,mlas who have chosen to side with their  not sunday rather than udav takri let's  break down right now for you the numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,1226400,1232320,as they stand with every passing day  more mlas have been joining hands with  eight not shinde what does that bring
pBWp7sZG66o,1232320,1237440,the shiv cena's number two the udha have  seen us number two it's down to just 17.
pBWp7sZG66o,1237440,1244799,so the support that udav has right now  is in the teens 17 mlas are backing him  whereas 38 mlas have chosen to side with
pBWp7sZG66o,1244799,1250159,eight not sunday besides that he's got  nine rebels also with him so 47 is the
pBWp7sZG66o,1250159,1256159,number with eight nothing there shinde's  expressed confidence to us here on india  today that the number of mlas backing
pBWp7sZG66o,1256159,1263120,him will actually surpass 50. so we'll  see if that actually happens but if you  look at the overall number game the ncp
pBWp7sZG66o,1263120,1269440,and congress of course their numbers  remain intact but because of how  precarious things are in maharashtra and
pBWp7sZG66o,1269440,1275360,how close it was the mva with shivsena's  numbers coming down to 17 doesn't have
pBWp7sZG66o,1275360,1280960,enough to continue to remain in power  whereas the bjp 806 if the cena rebels
pBWp7sZG66o,1280960,1287280,plus other rebels it not should this  camp actually join hands with the bjp  they'll comfortably have the numbers as
pBWp7sZG66o,1287280,1293600,well so this is what the numbers look  like right now in maharashtra dave this  is the point the fact that you know
pBWp7sZG66o,1293600,1301039,you've not got uh you know udav takri  doesn't have the numbers that he  requires but having said that uh you
pBWp7sZG66o,1301039,1306640,know there are possibilities that more  mlas also could join with shinde seda
pBWp7sZG66o,1306640,1313520,there was always the talk about 37 being  the magic number for ignatian day once  he crosses it he can't be disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,1313520,1319039,so then how is it that the deputy  speaker is still taking forward that  proceeding is it because he doesn't
pBWp7sZG66o,1319039,1323919,believe that thirty-seven numbers are  with eknot shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,1326159,1332559,uh yes also uh the fact that floor test  is something that is extremely important  the state governor will have to call for
pBWp7sZG66o,1332559,1338080,a floor test where you prove these  numbers  and you really play out the kind of
pBWp7sZG66o,1338080,1344000,figures and the numerics that are  required because of of course just  merely claiming that i have so many
pBWp7sZG66o,1344000,1349760,numbers goes on to prove nothing  you know you really have to play it out  in the assembly and show that this is
pBWp7sZG66o,1349760,1355600,the kind of support that i have in the  form of signatures  also where these mlas agree to the fact
pBWp7sZG66o,1355600,1361360,that yes we are going to be with such  and such person in their particular camp  so of course it is extremely important
pBWp7sZG66o,1361360,1367600,like you mentioned earlier to prove that  we have these kind of numbers so you  know merely just
pBWp7sZG66o,1367600,1372960,it is considered as near lip service  because if you don't go on to prove the  numbers otherwise how else are you going
pBWp7sZG66o,1372960,1379520,to be able to form the government so  even post the magic number the flow test  is something that is going to be of
pBWp7sZG66o,1379520,1385600,utmost essence and highly important  because that's where as for the legal  procedure
pBWp7sZG66o,1385600,1391600,and as per the political process also  that takes place later in the assembly  uh you know floor test is something that
pBWp7sZG66o,1391600,1397760,really determines in terms of who can  form the government and who doesn't  really have the numbers to do so so
pBWp7sZG66o,1397760,1405200,these are the kind of very basic  important points that we have to take  into consideration  uh given the fact that mba government
pBWp7sZG66o,1405200,1410960,clearly lacks the kind of numbers so  yeah yeah  all right uh dave just stay on with me i
pBWp7sZG66o,1410960,1417840,want to focus on what's uh the shinde  cena strategy here because after the  disqualification plea was submitted
pBWp7sZG66o,1417840,1425200,before the deputy speaker by udav cena  the shinde faction was given a notice of  no confidence against the deputy speaker
pBWp7sZG66o,1425200,1431200,amid this continuing terror for within  the shiv sena the shinde faction has  also said that bharat kokovlay has been
pBWp7sZG66o,1431200,1437679,appointed as the chief whip of the party  so any sort of whip that's been issued  by the uddhav sena simply doesn't matter
pBWp7sZG66o,1437679,1444159,the shinde cena has uh escalated the war  with chief minister of taqre they've  maintained that with the no confidence
pBWp7sZG66o,1444159,1450320,against the deputy speaker he cannot  take any sort of decision on  disqualification shinde cena and his
pBWp7sZG66o,1450320,1456960,mlas are deliberating right now on the  next course of action shivsena had  written to the deputy speaker seeking
pBWp7sZG66o,1456960,1462000,disqualification of 16 rebel mlas and  the fact that a notice could be issued
pBWp7sZG66o,1462000,1468320,today by the deputy speaker on that will  no doubt have ignored and they worried  uh i want to bring in palmy sahara
pBWp7sZG66o,1468320,1476080,quickly on that as well follow me uh you  know with shinde facing perhaps  disqualification uh he's taken that step
pBWp7sZG66o,1476080,1482320,of going ahead and now taking on the  deputy speaker directly saying that they  are trying to pass a no confidence
pBWp7sZG66o,1482320,1487919,motion against him issuing a notice on  that and essentially the messaging seems  to be give us an opportunity to show off
pBWp7sZG66o,1487919,1492480,our numbers before you decide on  disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,1495520,1502400,that's right you know this is obviously  about the political war itself as far as  uh you know the shinde uh camp versus
pBWp7sZG66o,1502400,1508880,the deputy speaker is concerned because  the deputy speaker belongs to the ncp  and the shinde camp had anticipated that
pBWp7sZG66o,1508880,1515200,he might be taking actions which might  be detrimental to their course of action  first of course it was demonstrated with
pBWp7sZG66o,1515200,1521200,the deputy speaker uh accepting the  demand of the shiv sena party and  removing iknow shinde as the leader of
pBWp7sZG66o,1521200,1528159,the legislative party and appointing aj  chaudhary in his place uh and now of  course are the notices uh uh which will
pBWp7sZG66o,1528159,1534640,be issued to these 16 rebel mlas by the  deputy speaker as per protocol because  he's received the disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,1534640,1540640,notice from the shivsena uh that you  know they should be appearing before him  physically at the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,1540640,1547200,legislative assembly within 48 hours in  order to of course put forth their side  of things it's unlikely uh that all of
pBWp7sZG66o,1547200,1554640,these mlas will be in fact appearing  before uh  uh because of this because uh uh
pBWp7sZG66o,1554640,1560480,he had the option he had the option to  in fact have them join over video  conferencing but he's not uh likely to
pBWp7sZG66o,1560480,1566480,give them that option he will ask them  to be physically present so they had  anticipated uh the same so they will be
pBWp7sZG66o,1566480,1571600,of course uh you know at the moment  preparing uh their counter strategy like  i said they have thrown in the no
pBWp7sZG66o,1571600,1577600,confidence motions against the deputy  speaker already because that puts the  deputy speaker like i said in a bind
pBWp7sZG66o,1577600,1584640,constitutionally because if there is a  no confidence resolution against you  then it's uh you cannot move uh forward
pBWp7sZG66o,1584640,1591200,in terms of disqualification or for  members of the assembly and that could  then well end up in the courtrooms the
pBWp7sZG66o,1591200,1596320,ship cena will have to take it to the  court or if he does go ahead and  disqualify these rebel mlas they'll have
pBWp7sZG66o,1596320,1602320,to challenge it in a court so this is  going to turn out to er into a legal  battle but is that going to constrain
pBWp7sZG66o,1602320,1608559,them from moving forward in their  political ambitions uh or are they going  to wait and watch as far as the legal
pBWp7sZG66o,1608559,1615279,battle unfolds because that could drag  on so that is going to be of course uh  very critical to how the camp moves
pBWp7sZG66o,1615279,1621679,forward henceforth because numbers they  have at the moment they've crossed the  two third majority figure but um
pBWp7sZG66o,1621679,1627279,because of the challenges that they're  facing uh from all corners it remains to  be seen how they tackle that akshata
pBWp7sZG66o,1627279,1633200,okay apollo me stay on with me i also  want to play out a conversation that my  colleague preethi chaudhary had with one
pBWp7sZG66o,1633200,1638720,of the rebel mlas who's staying in  guwahati with eight not [ __ ] there  deeper kasaka spoke out on exactly what
pBWp7sZG66o,1638720,1643919,their strategy is going forward  sir tell me something earlier on there
pBWp7sZG66o,1643919,1650720,was indication that mr shinde and some  of you are going to fly down to  uh mumbai to seek an appointment with
pBWp7sZG66o,1650720,1655760,the deputy speaker why was that cancer  when are you going to come back now
pBWp7sZG66o,1655760,1661279,no it is for the deputy speaker to give  us an appointment if he at all wants to
pBWp7sZG66o,1661279,1667840,recheck the signatures because all  signatures  are with uh see uh the deputy vicar's
pBWp7sZG66o,1667840,1673360,office  and he can very well verify  whether there are 38 signatures or not
pBWp7sZG66o,1673360,1680640,along with that we have sender videos  also  so we should not feel that we have not  signed we have testified that we have
pBWp7sZG66o,1680640,1686080,signed and we have signed affiliates  also  when are you going to be sitting in
pBWp7sZG66o,1686080,1691679,guwahati  no unless they  give a recognition to our
pBWp7sZG66o,1691679,1697760,group which is our constitutional right  the constitution says that you must have  two third majority and we have two third
pBWp7sZG66o,1697760,1702799,majority so one must uh you know honor  the constitution but sir there are lots
pBWp7sZG66o,1702799,1709039,of loopholes even in having two third  majority but that aside uh  now the shift sena has mooted 16 of you
pBWp7sZG66o,1709039,1716159,including you uh be disqualified now  that will mean that this will go into  the courts the rest of you will yes
pBWp7sZG66o,1716159,1721600,do you think 15 people could disqualify  40 people  is it a
pBWp7sZG66o,1721600,1726640,mockery of democracy anybody who will go  to go to court will win and they have
pBWp7sZG66o,1726640,1733840,not disqualified us as yet  because there is a principle of natural  justice by just claiming by cena that we
pBWp7sZG66o,1733840,1740799,are disqualified  the honorable speaker will have to give  us hearing
pBWp7sZG66o,1741440,1748559,the shift  to anybody sir the shift has been smart  in that thing  in that aspect they haven't disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,1748559,1754640,all of you no not 38 of you they've  disqualified only 16 of you no this is  just when people lose
pBWp7sZG66o,1754640,1759919,their majority they play tricks like  that and that happens everywhere so you
pBWp7sZG66o,1759919,1765840,will have to accept the democracy you  will have to accept that you have lost  the confidence of the most of the mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,1765840,1772240,and then you should step down  so with this all-out rebellion against
pBWp7sZG66o,1772240,1778320,udav takri how are political parties  reacting what are they planning to do  today with all eyes on shinde's next
pBWp7sZG66o,1778320,1784880,move the udav cena is going to hold a  natural executive meet as well as a  public meeting in mumbai today chief

pBWp7sZG66o,2515359,2520560,they've given is for the end users  basically you have the option of
pBWp7sZG66o,2520560,2525760,tokenizing your debit card or credit  card details tokenization is basically
pBWp7sZG66o,2525760,2530800,issuing you a unique encrypted code  which is called a token for each one of
pBWp7sZG66o,2530800,2538160,your cards and to opt for this  tokenization process each end user will  have to authorize it
pBWp7sZG66o,2538160,2544240,before july 1st if you were using any  one of your cards on a platform like  amazon those cards would basically get
pBWp7sZG66o,2544240,2549440,saved on that platform so next time when  you want to choose to pay you can choose
pBWp7sZG66o,2549440,2556160,from any one of these cards that you've  already saved on that now what you'll  basically get is a certain notification
pBWp7sZG66o,2556160,2561680,along with each one of these cards which  will basically say that your card is not  saved yet
pBWp7sZG66o,2561680,2567359,once you press on that you will have the  option of saving the card details and  then you can proceed with the payment
pBWp7sZG66o,2567359,2572800,after july 1st what's going to happen is  that that notification will not be there  because even those card details will get
pBWp7sZG66o,2572800,2578640,deleted so you will have to fill in all  those details again and then save them
pBWp7sZG66o,2578640,2584400,so this tokenization process will just  take a few seconds it does not cost  anything and it's only applicable to
pBWp7sZG66o,2584400,2590480,domestic online transactions  it will offer more security because your
pBWp7sZG66o,2590480,2596160,car details will not be saved with the  online merchant either a lot of times  your car details get leaked from the
pBWp7sZG66o,2596160,2602560,merchant that you're interacting with  online so that gets negated secondly uh  you have a token which you're getting
pBWp7sZG66o,2602560,2607839,you'll just need to fill in your cvv  number and an otp which you'll get after  that so the process of making that
pBWp7sZG66o,2607839,2613510,payment will obviously be shorter but  this tokenization process is totally  optional it is not mandatory
pBWp7sZG66o,2613510,2618640,[Music]  you are watching
pBWp7sZG66o,2618640,2621640,india
pBWp7sZG66o,2624160,2629880,you are watching  india today
pBWp7sZG66o,2635040,2642880,welcome back we're also getting your  details of another big story that we're  tracking this saturday a quote in  pakistan awarding an over 15-year jail
pBWp7sZG66o,2642880,2648800,term to sergeant the main handler of the  26-11 mumbai attacks he was presumed
pBWp7sZG66o,2648800,2656079,dead or so pakistan claimed and now he's  in pakistan's custody in a terror  financing case mary is in his mid 40s
pBWp7sZG66o,2656079,2661359,and has been in the court luck but jail  since his arrest this april pakistan has
pBWp7sZG66o,2661359,2668400,confirmed the court has also imposed a  fine of over four lakh rupees on the  convict uh sergeant mir has bounty of 5
pBWp7sZG66o,2668400,2676880,million us dollars is also in india's  most wanted list for his role in the  2611 mumbai attacks in which 166 people
pBWp7sZG66o,2676880,2682880,died he was referred to as the project  manager of the mumbai attacks and  reportedly had also visited india in
pBWp7sZG66o,2682880,2688640,2005 using a fake passport with a fake  name there was ample evidence that this
pBWp7sZG66o,2688640,2695200,man was the mastermind of the mumbai  attacks remember that hafiz said another  mastermind has already been sentenced to
pBWp7sZG66o,2695200,2700400,a 68-year imprisonment in terror  financing cases by the lahore courts
pBWp7sZG66o,2700400,2706000,this sentence is running concurrently  which means he doesn't have to spend  many years in jail and pakistan has time
pBWp7sZG66o,2706000,2711920,and again shied away from in fact taking  action against these masterminds the
pBWp7sZG66o,2711920,2718200,perpetrators of the 26 11 terror attacks
pBWp7sZG66o,2719359,2725359,uh sajid mir one of the key conspirators  the alleged mastermind of the terror  attack for long we've been going after
pBWp7sZG66o,2725359,2732640,him pakistan has been claiming he's dead  now finally he's been taken into custody  sir
pBWp7sZG66o,2732640,2738960,a good question is why pakistan did not  arrest immediately after the terror
pBWp7sZG66o,2738960,2744240,attack of 2008  because india has punished tangible
pBWp7sZG66o,2744240,2750800,evidence against sadist meat  let me tell you very clearly the role of  the sagitta means in the total
pBWp7sZG66o,2750800,2757839,conspiracy behind the terror attack is  deeply involved  secondly he was interacting the ten
pBWp7sZG66o,2757839,2764640,attackers during the attack he was  giving instructions from the mobile  phone  this telephone conversation had been
pBWp7sZG66o,2764640,2769680,intercepted by our indian authorities  and not only that whatever i had led the
pBWp7sZG66o,2769680,2775839,evidence  in mumbai court not only that again the  ten terrorists but also against those
pBWp7sZG66o,2775839,2781760,who were behind the criminal conspiracy  sajid nickname is washi bhai
pBWp7sZG66o,2781760,2788800,the all the ten attackers were calling  him as washi bhai washington used to  guide them you should talk in this
pBWp7sZG66o,2788800,2794640,manner you should tell this to this  particular media house in this manner  you should ask your demand in this
pBWp7sZG66o,2794640,2802160,manner so all the instructions the  details of the entire female conspiracy  was at with his consent he was the
pBWp7sZG66o,2802160,2808800,number two operative in lashkar swaba  and we have marshall that evidence we  have placed the telephone conversation
pBWp7sZG66o,2808800,2815760,of the record but pakistan did not  arrest him now the pakistan is playing  the drama because the pakistan would
pBWp7sZG66o,2815760,2822480,like to save from the extra financial  action task force because this time  financial action task force also did not
pBWp7sZG66o,2822480,2829280,remove the name of the pakistan from the  great least and therefore the in order  to avoid that
pBWp7sZG66o,2829280,2835680,embarrassing situation pakistan is now  showing that we have already said we  have sentenced improvements with muslims
pBWp7sZG66o,2835680,2841680,twenties why you did not arrest him in  their terror attack behind the criminal  conspiracy and what has happened about
pBWp7sZG66o,2841680,2848480,that trial so all these questions are  there but i think the financial action  task force won't be spread away by this
pBWp7sZG66o,2848480,2853760,uh dramatic action of the [ __ ] time  very true sir and mr ojo nakam now with
pBWp7sZG66o,2853760,2859520,this particular step dude being taken  what do you think has prompted them to  do it now as you said there's sizable
pBWp7sZG66o,2859520,2865280,evidence of sahaja mira's involvement  for the longest time pakistan  conveniently said that sahaja mera is
pBWp7sZG66o,2865280,2872000,dead what do you think has prompted them  finally to take this step do you think  it was consistent pressure from india
pBWp7sZG66o,2872000,2878800,indeed it's in india's victory because  india has given all the tangible  evidence to the pakistani authority as
pBWp7sZG66o,2878800,2883839,well as we have given the evidence to  the  interpol also mumbai court has issued a
pBWp7sZG66o,2883839,2890480,non-valuable warrant against him he's a  wanted accused still in twenty six  percent on the time and you see there
pBWp7sZG66o,2890480,2897280,are so many evidence i have examined  that david lee also we have arrested an  abuja  who was also during the attack in that
pBWp7sZG66o,2897280,2902800,control room so we have the voluminous  documentary evidence against the
pBWp7sZG66o,2902800,2909280,scientific alliance vashti vashi bhai  kita mohan is joining us on this  broadcast a forward of his editor for
pBWp7sZG66o,2909280,2915359,more details on this declaration by  pakistan he was taken into custody in  april is the information that pakistan
pBWp7sZG66o,2915359,2921520,has put out gita and let's be very clear  here it's not like pakistan uh you know  has grown a conscience or anything of
pBWp7sZG66o,2921520,2926720,the sort this is essentially to ensure  that they get the clean [ __ ] from the  fatf
pBWp7sZG66o,2926720,2934880,well absolutely they they did this  before the fataf plenary in berlin are  between june 14th and 17th and uh the
pBWp7sZG66o,2934880,2940319,intent was of pakistan to show that they  are coming clean on the issue of uh
pBWp7sZG66o,2940319,2948000,terrorism and terror financing sergey  mir has been uh one of the most wanted  uh terrorists in the world and uh there
pBWp7sZG66o,2948000,2953839,is a huge bounty by the uh united states  government as well uh so the killing of
pBWp7sZG66o,2953839,2959119,a u.s national in the mumbai terror  attacks is one of the reasons why we've
pBWp7sZG66o,2959119,2964480,seen u.s follow up all these  perpetrators or alleged perpetrators and
pBWp7sZG66o,2964480,2969680,masterminds of the 26 11 attacks and the  pressure was mounting
pBWp7sZG66o,2969680,2976319,if pakistan would not have arrested and  shown and sent the message across two  western intelligence who were handling
pBWp7sZG66o,2976319,2982400,the entire case before uh the fata  plenary then uh the plenary decision on
pBWp7sZG66o,2982400,2988160,uh giving reprieve to pakistan would not  really have come about so a very  important
pBWp7sZG66o,2988160,2993599,decision there but again a man who was  not locatable
pBWp7sZG66o,2993599,2999680,who also was dead at some point in time  that pakistan suddenly has resurfaced
pBWp7sZG66o,2999680,3004800,and has been arrested again we know that  pakistan does this to convince uh its
pBWp7sZG66o,3004800,3010720,western allies and partners that they  are intent in fighting terrorism but on  the ground the situation still is
pBWp7sZG66o,3010720,3019519,different and we still have to see  pakistan walk the talk  all right gita thank you very much for  joining us with all of those details
pBWp7sZG66o,3020319,3026559,and that's all we have time for on this  broadcast slipping into a very short  break do stay with us because just in a  few moments from now we're getting you

pBWp7sZG66o,3063760,3069920,it covered  a massive solar flare erupted from  earth's star as it got active in its new
pBWp7sZG66o,3069920,3075520,cycle a sunspot exploded and produced  flares which lasted for eight hours
pBWp7sZG66o,3075520,3083280,the event led to a shortwave radio  blackout for eight hours over japan and  southeast asia before we get into the
pBWp7sZG66o,3083280,3089040,technicalities of what caused this let's  learn about solar flares
pBWp7sZG66o,3090400,3096000,a solar flare is an intense localized  eruption of electromagnetic radiation in
pBWp7sZG66o,3096000,3101119,the sun's atmosphere its occurrence will  disrupt radio signals
pBWp7sZG66o,3101119,3107359,the occurrence of solar flare also  varies upon 11-year cycle
pBWp7sZG66o,3108640,3115280,the solar flare unleashed superheated  plasma from the sun powering them at  speeds ranging in millions of kilometers
pBWp7sZG66o,3115280,3122000,per hour  the growing sunspot  ar3032 exploded producing m3 class
pBWp7sZG66o,3122000,3127040,flares that lasted nearly eight hours  it hurled towards the inner planets
pBWp7sZG66o,3127040,3133440,including earth ionized the top of the  atmosphere with the extreme ultraviolet  radiation released from the sun
pBWp7sZG66o,3133440,3139359,geomagnetic storms are a major  disturbance of earth's magnetosphere  that occurs when there is a very

pBWp7sZG66o,3187280,3195000,we know that plastic caused pollution  but did you know microplastics can also  be a cause of pollution
pBWp7sZG66o,3196640,3203680,microplastics are plastic particles with  dimensions less than five millimeters  some are so small they are invisible to
pBWp7sZG66o,3203680,3210640,the naked eye nylon and polyethylene for  example our mixture of polymers and  additives are themselves microplastics
pBWp7sZG66o,3210640,3216800,created from tiny pellets known as  nerdls these elements are found in  everyday products like shower gels and
pBWp7sZG66o,3216800,3223920,cosmetics as well as fertilizers  detergents and paint another major  source of this pollution is car tire
pBWp7sZG66o,3223920,3231359,wear difficult to filter these micro  plastics get everywhere in rivers and  then the oceans on land or in the air we
pBWp7sZG66o,3231359,3238640,breed billions of items of plastic waste  taking hundreds of years to break down  little beaches all around the world all

pBWp7sZG66o,3244800,3251760,ingest microplastics the impact of  microplastics on organisms or on  ecosystems is unknown but the additives

pBWp7sZG66o,3548079,3553839,and let's get you all the updates coming  in in the maharashtra political crisis  the shift cena is targeted to the bjp
pBWp7sZG66o,3553839,3561280,through its mouthpiece samna yet again  in the cena mouthpiece some now they've  slammed the rebel mlas as well the ship
pBWp7sZG66o,3561280,3567440,cena essentially has in fact said that  the chief minister of assam is spending
pBWp7sZG66o,3567440,3573470,his entire sadhana for the yoga camp  at radisson blue
pBWp7sZG66o,3573470,3579280,[Music]  so this is in fact the comment uh that  shiv cena said they also said that the
pBWp7sZG66o,3579280,3584400,entire opposition in the country is  united against these uh
pBWp7sZG66o,3584400,3588720,tactics by the bjp
pBWp7sZG66o,3589760,3595760,dave kotak is joining us live from  mumbai with more details on this so  they've once again the shifts in are
pBWp7sZG66o,3595760,3602640,choosing to pin the blame on the bjp  what has become essentially a trend  every morning is indian mouthpiece the
pBWp7sZG66o,3602640,3608400,sumner putting out scathing articles  about the bjp but not talking about the
pBWp7sZG66o,3608400,3614440,crisis perhaps the introspection that's  needed within the shiv cena
pBWp7sZG66o,3616160,3622400,uh well uh this is not the first  occasion where samna the shivsena's  editorial mouthpiece is being used as a
pBWp7sZG66o,3622400,3629760,medium or a tool to attack  anti-shiv sena  policies or people who are against the
pBWp7sZG66o,3629760,3636160,cena in any form  so you know there have been several  occasions and for years uh you know the
pBWp7sZG66o,3636160,3642720,samna is being used as a tool to counter  the kind of policies that are being  discussed in the state especially where
pBWp7sZG66o,3642720,3649520,shivsena does not have any consensus or  is not in favor of something like that  so like i mentioned that this is
pBWp7sZG66o,3649520,3654880,definitely not the first occasion so of  course being their own newspaper they're
pBWp7sZG66o,3654880,3660240,going to use it to attack the bjp and  try to make them look like they are at
pBWp7sZG66o,3660240,3666880,fault and entirely responsible for  toppling the state government and the  political crisis especially given the
pBWp7sZG66o,3666880,3674720,fact that iknow one of the rebel mla  along with 16 more mlas has gone on to
pBWp7sZG66o,3674720,3680960,the right  has moved to the radisson blue hotel in  gohati so of course they are using this
pBWp7sZG66o,3680960,3688319,as a medium to hide the problems that  existed within the shiv cena which in  the first place uh prompted the mls to
pBWp7sZG66o,3688319,3695119,rebel in fact the aurangabad west mla  sanjay shivsat in a letter also had said
pBWp7sZG66o,3695119,3700319,that mr uttar thakri the state chief  minister has always remained unavailable
pBWp7sZG66o,3700319,3705359,rather than finding him at his varsity  bangalore which is the official  residence of the chief minister he would
pBWp7sZG66o,3705359,3711359,always be found at mato sri which is the  taqrei residence however they also say  that it is because
pBWp7sZG66o,3711359,3717599,because of the fact that he was always  highly inaccessible and they were not  allowed to meet him in fact even though
pBWp7sZG66o,3717599,3723359,they were the mlas  more priority was given to the or to
pBWp7sZG66o,3723359,3729920,people who were considered as opposition  which is the ncp and the congress they  were given larger and greater access
pBWp7sZG66o,3729920,3737039,their mlas were also given funds uh to  conduct development work in their  constituency but whereas their own ships
pBWp7sZG66o,3737039,3742079,in mlas who wanted to meet mr takrev or  denied access especially by those people
pBWp7sZG66o,3742079,3747680,who were uh forming the inner courtery  of mr uddhav thakure they would decide
pBWp7sZG66o,3747680,3754319,and they would be calling the shots and  taking calls whether a particular mla  can meet the cm or cannot meet the cm so
pBWp7sZG66o,3754319,3760240,there was this growing amount of  distrust and unhappiness that was  growing since a very long time of course
pBWp7sZG66o,3760240,3766960,this is not something that took place  overnight or in just a span of two to  three days so mr sanjay shishat has also
pBWp7sZG66o,3766960,3773200,said  that  we when the shifts in our votes did not  split during the rajya sabha polls then
pBWp7sZG66o,3773200,3779680,why so much distrust in us during the  legislative council election so these  are the kind of very valid arguments
pBWp7sZG66o,3779680,3785039,that have been put forth and mr shisha  clearly went on to mention and clarify
pBWp7sZG66o,3785039,3790240,the fact that because all of us were so  miffed and we did not know how to work
pBWp7sZG66o,3790240,3797359,around this problem when we cannot meet  our own chief minister what can we even  expect uh in terms of the good things to
pBWp7sZG66o,3797359,3804799,come out of the state during shiv cena's  ruling tenure so mr aikena  is the one who really mobilized us and
pBWp7sZG66o,3804799,3809920,prompted us to you know really go all  out against this and show our uh
pBWp7sZG66o,3809920,3815599,unhappiness and a display and open sense  of distrust in the chief minister and
pBWp7sZG66o,3815599,3822960,the kind of actions that he engaged and  indulged in giving us very little access  so this is one very important point
pBWp7sZG66o,3822960,3828160,to try and counter the kind of arguments  that have been made in the samna  editorial piece
pBWp7sZG66o,3828160,3834240,okay they've stayed on with me meanwhile  shibsona mp sanjay raoth has taken to
pBWp7sZG66o,3834240,3841520,twitter to taunt the rebels he's hinted  essentially a money power being at play  here and has put out a message
pBWp7sZG66o,3841520,3848400,essentially a quote from rudyard kipling  uh to in fact say that any over concern
pBWp7sZG66o,3848400,3856079,for  money position or glory one must be  beware of sanjay rauth has shared this  particular quote with a caption of j
pBWp7sZG66o,3856079,3861520,maharashtra let me bring him follow me  saha also on this broadcast follow me  this is something of course of the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,3861520,3866559,cena has been maintaining from day one  asking where did the money for this kind  of rebellion come from and they've
pBWp7sZG66o,3866559,3872079,claimed a direct link of the bjp of  course it's something that there's also  ample talk about because of the fact
pBWp7sZG66o,3872079,3877760,that you had the assam chief minister  visiting the radisson blue hotel just  moments before the rebel mlas landed up
pBWp7sZG66o,3877760,3886720,there and the fact that they moved from  one bjp road state to another  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,3886720,3892880,that's right uh of course uh you know uh  as far as the ships enough action in  mumbai is concerned and they have been
pBWp7sZG66o,3892880,3899119,taking now direct uh pot shots at the  bhartiya jata party while it was only uh  some of the functionaries within the
pBWp7sZG66o,3899119,3905680,party and members of parliament like mr  route himself and others mr arvind savin  of course uh uh saying categorically uh
pBWp7sZG66o,3905680,3910960,that it was the bjp which was uh behind  this operation and orchestrating this  operation and the bgp was bearing the
pBWp7sZG66o,3910960,3916000,costs of this operation as well because  it's not exactly uh cheap money to uh
pBWp7sZG66o,3916000,3921359,you know keep chartering flights to  bring uh uh mla's in from sura to put
pBWp7sZG66o,3921359,3927680,them up in a hotel in surah then bring  them down over chartered flights in  installments at that uh two gowahati and
pBWp7sZG66o,3927680,3933839,put them up in this very posture hotel  in guwahati radisson blue as well it's  not very cheap exactly to do that so
pBWp7sZG66o,3933839,3939200,this shivsena's allegation in mumbai is  that this is being orchestrated by the  bhartiya jata party and funded by the
pBWp7sZG66o,3939200,3944880,party party but it was while it was  until yesterday limited to senior  functionalities of the party it was udav
pBWp7sZG66o,3944880,3950720,thakrei who took direct pot shots and uh  in fact attacked the bjp uh yesterday
pBWp7sZG66o,3950720,3957839,saying that this entire operation is bjp  orchestrated and it is the bjp which is  trying to drive a wedge within the shiv
pBWp7sZG66o,3957839,3963119,cena and that is uh the bjp's policy use  and throw he said he warned his rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,3963119,3970079,mlas that use and throw is the bgp's  policy they use you and they will show  you and it is their policy to have two
pBWp7sZG66o,3970079,3976720,factions within a party fight and while  they sit back and watch and the  repercussions of it are felt by the
pBWp7sZG66o,3976720,3983359,party that is fighting at bjp uh doesn't  even like you know uh get hit in the  process in any which way so it was a
pBWp7sZG66o,3983359,3990079,udhav takri who categorically came out  and spoke out against the bhartiya janta  party ashita okay pauline stay on with
pBWp7sZG66o,3990079,3995280,us i want to brief our viewers on what's  expected also through the day today
pBWp7sZG66o,3995280,4000799,because as the maharashtra political  crisis is entering its next stage  political parties have planned a slew of
pBWp7sZG66o,4000799,4007680,meetings now all eyes are on shinde's  next move the shift cena is going to be  holding a national executive meet as
pBWp7sZG66o,4007680,4014079,well as a public meeting in mumbai as  well uh you're going to see chief  minister udav takri calling for a
pBWp7sZG66o,4014079,4020079,meeting of all cena national executives  in senior above and aditya takari will  conduct a public meeting in the evening
pBWp7sZG66o,4020079,4026480,this will be happening at mumbai's  marine lines all youth shiv cenics have  been asked to attend that particular
pBWp7sZG66o,4026480,4032079,meet as well besides that devendra nova  is the bjp which has been watching this
pBWp7sZG66o,4032079,4037680,entire uh political crisis closely will  be also holding a meeting devendra
pBWp7sZG66o,4037680,4043920,father is meeting with allies at his  official residence sagar at 11 this  morning ramdas attawley union minister
pBWp7sZG66o,4043920,4050880,will also be present in that meeting the  bjp is strategizing no doubt to see how  the rebellion within the shift cena can
pBWp7sZG66o,4050880,4053599,benefit them
pBWp7sZG66o,4056559,4059559,from
pBWp7sZG66o,4127278,4130278,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,4157199,4160199,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,4172000,4175000,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,4177758,4184238,so that was uh the video message that  udav put out last evening again  resorting to the same emotional appeal
pBWp7sZG66o,4184238,4189278,but the reality is it's not helping him  in any way it's not triggered any sort
pBWp7sZG66o,4189278,4195840,of awakening of conscience of these  rebels look at the numbers as they stand  right now udav takre has just a handful
pBWp7sZG66o,4195840,4201040,of emilies with him it's reduced to 17  as 38 majority easily of the shifts shiv
pBWp7sZG66o,4201040,4206880,cena emilies are now with ignacion they  add to that nine rebel mlas these are
pBWp7sZG66o,4206880,4213120,mlas from independent independence as  well as from smaller parties and that  takes his number eight not shinde's
pBWp7sZG66o,4213120,4218239,number to 47. he's saying that he'll  cross the 50 mark as far as the ncp and
pBWp7sZG66o,4218239,4223280,the congress is concerned their numbers  are untouched but the problem is that  the shifts in us down to the teens it's
pBWp7sZG66o,4223280,4229760,down to 17 which means that the mva  doesn't have the numbers anymore the bjp  of course stands to gain eight now
pBWp7sZG66o,4229760,4236080,shinde we're being told his strategy is  to ensure that he joins fans with the  bjp and that they comfortably get the
pBWp7sZG66o,4236080,4239080,numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,4244480,4251280,let's cut across to a new spray coming  in from kane where there's a fear of  violence and a breakdown of law and
pBWp7sZG66o,4251280,4257040,order remember that it's a stronghold of  ignorance  prohibitory orders have been put in
pBWp7sZG66o,4257040,4262560,place now which will be valid till june  30th so as part of these orders carrying
pBWp7sZG66o,4262560,4267600,any sort of arms this means sticks  burning posters burning effigies
pBWp7sZG66o,4267600,4273679,carrying any kind of arms will be  completely banned no slogans songs are
pBWp7sZG66o,4273679,4280239,allowed nothing that can lead to a  political rift or any political  differences the order also goes on to
pBWp7sZG66o,4280239,4285840,state that uh all officials uh have in  fact been intimated that there's a
pBWp7sZG66o,4285840,4291440,prohibition order in place till june  30th  so this is the big news break that's
pBWp7sZG66o,4291440,4298880,coming in remember the town is a  stronghold of eight nation day there  have been a lot of reports of how  chivsanics in thane have been very split
pBWp7sZG66o,4298880,4306480,and very divided over eight not shinde's  rebellion and that is leading to some  tension on the ground
pBWp7sZG66o,4306480,4313120,dave kotak is joining us with more  details on this dev in kane which is  aknow shinde's area it's his stronghold
pBWp7sZG66o,4313120,4319360,we understand that a number of steps  have been taken to ensure no violence  breaks out uh you know as far as ships
pBWp7sZG66o,4319360,4326080,next and thani are concerned we hear  that there are a lot of contradictory  opinions on shinde's decision to rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,4326080,4331600,against udav takri  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,4331600,4337440,yes like i mentioned previously also  that there was a brewing
pBWp7sZG66o,4337440,4343040,brewing distrust within the party and  this is something  the state chief minister mr udati had
pBWp7sZG66o,4343040,4349679,failed to address at all points in time  giving more priority to the congress and  the ncp which are its coalition partners
pBWp7sZG66o,4349679,4357199,rather than tending to the demands and  hearing out the grievances of its own  party mlas which is why the in the first
pBWp7sZG66o,4357199,4363120,place they have uh rebelled and gone on  uh to challenge the uttar takari
pBWp7sZG66o,4363120,4369679,government also wanting to form a  separate government of their own the  main reason that they cited was that our
pBWp7sZG66o,4369679,4376960,own chief minister is not available to  us only so this is the  main reason why these people have gone
pBWp7sZG66o,4376960,4382159,uh on uh were earlier in an incognito  mode when they had reached surat and
pBWp7sZG66o,4382159,4389199,then of course by the time they reached  assam in guwahati uh you know at the  radisson blue hotel all of them were
pBWp7sZG66o,4389199,4395199,in clear communication uh with the other  people in shivsena here in bombay not
pBWp7sZG66o,4395199,4401920,from the rebel faction of course so  these are the kind of arguments that are  being uh mentioned however samna the
pBWp7sZG66o,4401920,4407360,editorial mouthpiece does not mention or  talk about these kind of problems they
pBWp7sZG66o,4407360,4413760,merely only blame bjp and in connection  to this  district which happens to be
pBWp7sZG66o,4413760,4421199,in this stronghold their prohibitory  orders have been put in place where  carrying sticks uh stones or any kind of
pBWp7sZG66o,4421199,4426239,swords or  you know sharp weapons has been  disallowed no singing or songs or slogan
pBWp7sZG66o,4426239,4431920,hearing either can take place because  the police have also been put on high  alert fearing that there might be
pBWp7sZG66o,4431920,4437280,violence from fellowships annex who are  who will come out in full force to show
pBWp7sZG66o,4437280,4443040,their support uh for uh mr udata and his  son aditya takri who was also a state
pBWp7sZG66o,4443040,4449440,minister from the shiv sena  of course one very important thing that  we need to keep in mind at all points in
pBWp7sZG66o,4449440,4456400,time is that while thani happens to be  the stronghold uh in case if at all  there any kind of violence takes place
pBWp7sZG66o,4456400,4461840,in that area then president's rule will  come into effect and will be in full
pBWp7sZG66o,4461840,4469520,force so in order  to avoid the president's rule which will  take away the slightest of possible uh
pBWp7sZG66o,4469520,4474960,chance or any kind of little bit  possibility for the government to retain  power that will also be gone so which is
pBWp7sZG66o,4474960,4481600,a very that is why it is extremely  important and significant at this point  in time to control the shield who might
pBWp7sZG66o,4481600,4486960,possibly even think of wanting to engage  in any kind of violence because like i  mentioned the president's rule come
pBWp7sZG66o,4486960,4493920,whatever little chance uh they have of  uh you know getting back in power and  continuing to hold uh you have exert
pBWp7sZG66o,4493920,4500480,their hold in the state in terms of a  ruling government that will also be gone  so that is why uh you know as long as
pBWp7sZG66o,4500480,4506640,it's peaceful and the police do not have  an objection to that um it is fine but
pBWp7sZG66o,4506640,4512719,uh engaging in any kind of violence  means or activities that may go on to
pBWp7sZG66o,4512719,4519600,challenge the prohibitory order in  itself okay might pose a problem for the  shiv cena not like it is not already in
pBWp7sZG66o,4519600,4524719,the middle of a crisis but it will only  add to their existing votes
pBWp7sZG66o,4524719,4531040,okay uh dave stay on with me i also want  to bring in ashutosh mishra on this  broadcast he's reporting live from  mumbai as well as
pBWp7sZG66o,4531040,4538080,uh you know while we're reporting on  what's happening in thai i want to bring  our focus back to the political  developments expected in mumbai today
pBWp7sZG66o,4538080,4544239,udav takri of course has been resorting  to one emotional appeal after another  but the reality is he doesn't have the
pBWp7sZG66o,4544239,4550800,numbers he's perhaps hoping on some sort  of you know legal relief he will  consider the deputy speaker taking that
pBWp7sZG66o,4550800,4555840,step of considering his disqualification  petition as a victory at a time when
pBWp7sZG66o,4555840,4559840,he's been facing one setback after  another
pBWp7sZG66o,4562239,4568159,and that's exactly you see the change in  the strategy akshita remember what had  happened 40 48 hours ago there was
pBWp7sZG66o,4568159,4575040,totally you know a depressive sentiment  amongst the shift cena and they were  totally on back foot clearly uh
pBWp7sZG66o,4575040,4580640,they perhaps realized that what could be  the next of course the government was  about to fall but certain things changed
pBWp7sZG66o,4580640,4587280,in 48 hours you yesterday if you heard  ajit pawara in the press conference  categorically saying there is no threat
pBWp7sZG66o,4587280,4594000,to government because it is the mahavika  saghadi government in existence because  no one at the moment has declared their
pBWp7sZG66o,4594000,4599199,rebel no one has withdrawn the support  from the government and even eknash
pBWp7sZG66o,4599199,4605840,hinde with those mlas they haven't  resigned yet hence the number on the  floor that remains with thee so clearly
pBWp7sZG66o,4605840,4611280,that seems to be the part of strategy  because suddenly it was decided that was  the letter of uh
pBWp7sZG66o,4611280,4617520,the resolution passed by shinde during  the meeting because it was  sort of the required number now that has
pBWp7sZG66o,4617520,4622560,been made made a ground by the  existing  under the uddhavdakray and they
pBWp7sZG66o,4622560,4628000,approached to the deputy speaker seeking  suspension of the 16 mla so clearly this
pBWp7sZG66o,4628000,4634880,all strategy worked and all it seems to  be the footprint of the idea suggested  by sharat pawar who stepped in day
pBWp7sZG66o,4634880,4640560,before yesterday and ever since all  these meetings happened there was also  anticipation that perhaps you've seen
pBWp7sZG66o,4640560,4646239,under the pressure could move out of mva  the alliance sanjay rao even hinted but
pBWp7sZG66o,4646239,4651679,then of course it was only the optics  calling the mlas the look if you want  you say not to exit off the alliance
pBWp7sZG66o,4651679,4657120,come here meet without hakare and uh  have your point with your party supremo
pBWp7sZG66o,4657120,4662960,but clearly that was part of the optics  and beside they were all buying time and  exactly the strategy is now coming out
pBWp7sZG66o,4662960,4669120,that what had happened how they all sat  together and now the way we are seeing  the congress and ncp one after one
pBWp7sZG66o,4669120,4674159,coming out declaring their open support  uddhav  and shiv sena so at the moment what we
pBWp7sZG66o,4674159,4679199,see the mva is not only intact but  suddenly from the back foot they have
pBWp7sZG66o,4679199,4684719,come to the  front foot and from the defensive they  have suddenly become offensive all these
pBWp7sZG66o,4684719,4691040,strategies that you're saying also the  um emotional appeal by uddah takri  remember the shiva sena is not
pBWp7sZG66o,4691040,4697760,as uh traditional party as pgp congress  or several other a carder based party  which runs on the emotion it always
pBWp7sZG66o,4697760,4706320,believed in the thought process of  ballast i have talked with the party  which originally from the different  ideas again engaged itself into hindi
pBWp7sZG66o,4706320,4712960,that clearly makes a pitch really even  difficult for bjp remember even ignacion  de rebel group if you have to compare it
pBWp7sZG66o,4712960,4720400,to the karnataka and madhya malays those  mlas were ready to even disqualified and  then recontest can the mla under the
pBWp7sZG66o,4720400,4725360,fray of iknow shin they afford to get  disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,4725679,4731679,about this uh disqualification also  ashitosh the fact is that the exception  to disqualification is two thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,4731679,4737199,party's strength which is what not  shinde says he has but at the end of the  day as ashutosh said that you know this
pBWp7sZG66o,4737199,4742719,is a counter-based party which is why  there's a lot of anger also shall come  back to you hold that thought uh i just
pBWp7sZG66o,4742719,4748480,want to play out a report about how the  ship cena the udav cena at least is  gearing up for this massive show of
pBWp7sZG66o,4748480,4754800,strength outside mato shree and on the  streets of mumbai chief minister that  taker sent across the message saying the
pBWp7sZG66o,4754800,4760920,fight will continue on the streets and  on the floor of the house
pBWp7sZG66o,4763120,4771600,posters defaced  officers vandalized
pBWp7sZG66o,4772800,4778800,[Music]  the shiv cena's fury at eight night  shinde's rebellion is taking a violent

pBWp7sZG66o,4872800,4880000,udav clearly doesn't have the numbers  right now but what he will be counting  on is the deputy speaker ruling in his
pBWp7sZG66o,4880000,4885199,favor and the first step towards that is  something that udhav will celebrate
pBWp7sZG66o,4885199,4891520,their deputy speakers accepted the play  of udafsena and is all set to summon the  rebel mlas notices will be served

pBWp7sZG66o,4910480,4916000,give up membership of the party or join  another party similarly if they choose  to vote or abstain from voting in
pBWp7sZG66o,4916000,4922639,contradiction to the party's standard  the parties issued whip they face  disqualification the exception is if
pBWp7sZG66o,4922639,4928400,two-thirds of the party decides to  switch now shinde has claimed that's  happened he's got 37 plus which was the
pBWp7sZG66o,4928400,4936319,number he  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,4967840,4973760,and let's also play out the conversation  that we had with the deputy speaker hari  zirwal who told us about the entire
pBWp7sZG66o,4973760,4977800,disqualification process
pBWp7sZG66o,5044639,5050400,so what is the shinde sena strategy  considering that the deputy speaker  seriously considering the petition filed
pBWp7sZG66o,5050400,5055679,by udhav sena on the disqualification of  rebel mlas well the shinde faction has
pBWp7sZG66o,5055679,5062320,given a notice of no confidence against  the deputy speaker the shinde faction  has also said that bharat gogavli has
pBWp7sZG66o,5062320,5068239,been appointed as a chief whip of the  party so any sort of directive issued by  the whip appointed by uddhav sena simply
pBWp7sZG66o,5068239,5075840,doesn't count  uh the shinde sena is essentially  escalating the war with chief minister  udav takri ah shinde and his mlas are
pBWp7sZG66o,5075840,5081199,deliberating on the next plan of action  uh especially because the deputy speaker
pBWp7sZG66o,5081199,5087520,is considering the disqualification of  sixteen rebel mlas including eight not  shinde shinde will have to prove his
pBWp7sZG66o,5087520,5092560,numbers now to the deputy speaker so  will he and his rebel mlas move to
pBWp7sZG66o,5092560,5099199,mumbai and parade numbers remains to be  seen and here's a conversation the
pBWp7sZG66o,5099199,5106320,preeti chaudhary had with one of the  rebel mlas with deepak kisarkar who's  staying in gowahati
pBWp7sZG66o,5107040,5113600,sir tell me something earlier on there  was indication that mr shinde and some  of you are going to fly down to uh
pBWp7sZG66o,5113600,5120639,mumbai to seek an appointment with the  deputy speaker why was that cancelled  when are you going to come back now
pBWp7sZG66o,5120639,5126080,no it is for the deputy speaker to give  us an appointment if he at all wants to
pBWp7sZG66o,5126080,5132719,recheck the signatures because all  signatures  are with uh see uh the deputy speaker's
pBWp7sZG66o,5132719,5138159,office  and he can very well verify  whether there are 38 signatures or not
pBWp7sZG66o,5138159,5145120,along with that we have send the videos  also so you should not feel that we have  not signed where we have testified that
pBWp7sZG66o,5145120,5150880,we have signed and we have signed  affidavits also  when are you going to be sitting in
pBWp7sZG66o,5150880,5158639,guwahati  no unless they give a recognition to our  uh group which is our constitutional
pBWp7sZG66o,5158639,5165040,right the constitution says that you  must have two third majority and we have  two third majority so one must
pBWp7sZG66o,5165040,5170639,you know honor the constitution but sir  there are lots of loopholes even in  having two third majority but that aside
pBWp7sZG66o,5170639,5176800,uh now the shift sena has mooted 16 of  you including you uh be disqualified now
pBWp7sZG66o,5176800,5183679,that will mean that this will go into  the courts the rest of you will yes  do you think 15 people could disqualify
pBWp7sZG66o,5183679,5188880,40 people  is it a moment  mockery of democracy anybody who will go
pBWp7sZG66o,5188880,5193920,to go to court will win and they have  not disqualified us as yet yes because
pBWp7sZG66o,5193920,5200480,there is a principle of natural justice  by just claiming by cena that we are  disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,5200480,5205679,uh  the honorable speaker will have to give  us hearing
pBWp7sZG66o,5206320,5213440,the shift  to  has been anybody in that thing  in that aspect they haven't disqualified
pBWp7sZG66o,5213440,5219440,all of you no not 38 of you they've  disqualified only 16 of you oh this is  just when people lose
pBWp7sZG66o,5219440,5226320,their majority they play tricks like  that and that happens everywhere  so you will have to accept the democracy
pBWp7sZG66o,5226320,5233520,you will have to accept that you have  lost the confidence of the most of the  mlas  and then you should step down
pBWp7sZG66o,5233520,5239440,let's explain to you what the 10th  schedule exactly says on what grounds  can an mla be disqualified number one if
pBWp7sZG66o,5239440,5245199,an mla gives up membership of the party  voluntarily or joins another party then
pBWp7sZG66o,5245199,5250320,he or she can be disqualified similarly  if they choose to vote or abstain from
pBWp7sZG66o,5250320,5256320,voting also in contradiction to the  party stand and in contradiction to the  whip issued by the party they can face
pBWp7sZG66o,5256320,5262000,disqualification now the exception to  this rule is that if two thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5262000,5268800,party decides to switch like in the case  of ignatinde they could save themselves  from disqualification that's why we kept
pBWp7sZG66o,5268800,5273920,saying that ikka shinde needed the  number 37 he's reached it so he's  effectively got two thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5273920,5280000,party's strength in the house with him  in which case he saves himself from  disqualification which is why it's
pBWp7sZG66o,5280000,5285280,interesting to see what the deputy  speaker will do next
pBWp7sZG66o,5285280,5290320,so the exception is two thirds of the  party's strength choosing to switch
pBWp7sZG66o,5290320,5297440,choosing to rebel and that's happened in  the case of shinde which is why  uh there are questions about why this
pBWp7sZG66o,5297440,5303040,step is being taken by the deputy  speaker is it that he wants aiknot  shinde to show off his strength to prove
pBWp7sZG66o,5303040,5308280,that he actually has two-thirds of the  party strength
pBWp7sZG66o,5310080,5315440,well in a legislative process finally  the numbers will be shown only on the  floor of the house now as far as 10
pBWp7sZG66o,5315440,5321920,schedules the last you know the para is  concerned it has multiple uh you know  interpretation the first it says the
pBWp7sZG66o,5321920,5327679,two-third majority split and declare  them one of them as a leader of the  house but there is another
pBWp7sZG66o,5327679,5333199,interpretation which also says that  after two third majority two third  number from the party if you merge with
pBWp7sZG66o,5333199,5338480,the another party so you know clearly  until it is there is legal judicial  intervention and the final words from
pBWp7sZG66o,5338480,5343760,the judiciary what it seems that end of  the day it is likely to end up going to  the high court and the supreme court but
pBWp7sZG66o,5343760,5350400,for now it is and remember this  disqualification is not about the number  that igna shinde has at the moment this
pBWp7sZG66o,5350400,5356880,is about the letter of resolution sent  by ikna shinde when he was just short of  the majority and that's exactly been
pBWp7sZG66o,5356880,5361920,made the ground that there was a meeting  called and they defied the whip they did  not appear for the meeting hence this is
pBWp7sZG66o,5361920,5367360,for anti-party activity and hence the  disqualification process so this is  about the letter of resolution then sent
pBWp7sZG66o,5367360,5373840,by ignacion they faction when they were  short of the majority taking that ground  the deputy speaker and the bishop zena
pBWp7sZG66o,5373840,5379679,has initiated this disqualification at  present and that's exactly if you  remember day yesterday and day before
pBWp7sZG66o,5379679,5385679,yesterday a fresh letter was sent by  shinder group to the uh speaker where  they also expressed the no confidence
pBWp7sZG66o,5385679,5392080,against the deputy speaker so what you  have the number remember the legislative  process or the legal process it goes on
pBWp7sZG66o,5392080,5397760,the paper and black and white word so at  the moment when you shoot a resolution  and send to the deputy speaker for
pBWp7sZG66o,5397760,5404159,certain declaration if you are short of  a single number that gives a strong  ground to the deputy speaker and the
pBWp7sZG66o,5404159,5410639,legislative process to you know take  appropriate action so that seems to be  one you know weak point of the ignition
pBWp7sZG66o,5410639,5415920,day that made at the moment what happens  at the moment he has the number right  and that perhaps acknowledged by the
pBWp7sZG66o,5415920,5420960,mahavira  exactly then that's
pBWp7sZG66o,5421199,5427360,did acknowledge that they are short of  the number but it is now laday of the  and the fight of the carter the shiva
pBWp7sZG66o,5427360,5433280,cena the organization that's why we are  saying outside this optics from the ship  cena because one side they have to fight
pBWp7sZG66o,5433280,5438480,for the number on the floor of the house  and other side and what is more  important and the most important in this
pBWp7sZG66o,5438480,5445679,legal and legislative process is that if  you compare this to what had happened in  karnataka and madhya pradesh the mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,5445679,5451600,were ready to even resign and then  re-contest yeah here the question goes  to the eknash in their faction that are
pBWp7sZG66o,5451600,5458400,they ready to resign just in case if  there is a disqualification are they  ready to lose their membership because
pBWp7sZG66o,5458400,5464239,what happens next in high court or the  supreme court no one knows but for now  if the jesus process is initiated and
pBWp7sZG66o,5464239,5469520,what we are anticipated that they are  disqualified then the number in the  house goes in the favor of the maha
pBWp7sZG66o,5469520,5475920,because agari that's what i said that  there is a new strategy drawn in last 48  hours and that's why exactly giving a
pBWp7sZG66o,5475920,5481360,sort of confidence and at the same time  of course what we heard that yesterday  nation they was also seeking legal
pBWp7sZG66o,5481360,5487360,opinion here deputy speaker called the  advocate general and several other legal  counsel those all legal references are
pBWp7sZG66o,5487360,5493199,being drawn being taken for the next  course of the action but the question  also now goes on this in the faction
pBWp7sZG66o,5493199,5499600,that are they ready to be disqualified  and then think the future political  courts action because okay one side the
pBWp7sZG66o,5499600,5505840,challenge is for the mba the other side  there are legal challenges for the iknow  shinde faction as well right ashuda stay
pBWp7sZG66o,5505840,5511760,with me paula me saha is reporting from  gohari on exactly what shinde's next  move is going to be with this deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,5511760,5517120,speaker considering this  disqualification petition filed by udav  takri palami is there a likelihood that
pBWp7sZG66o,5517120,5523440,iknow shinde will now expedite his plans  ensure that he parades all of the mlas  that he has with him uh in mumbai
pBWp7sZG66o,5523440,5529280,because it comes down to that if the  deputy speaker is given concrete proof  that iknow shinde has two thirds of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5529280,5536239,party strength with him then this entire  talk of disqualification essentially  will be set aside
pBWp7sZG66o,5540239,5546960,first of all i'd just like to bring out  two points i just spoke to uh some of  the rebel mlas inside uh radisson blue
pBWp7sZG66o,5546960,5553920,hotel two points uh that we can in fact  uh put out right now for our viewers one  is that the iknow shinde camp will be
pBWp7sZG66o,5553920,5559520,meeting inside radisson blue hotel at 2  pm today there'll be a meeting of the  entire
pBWp7sZG66o,5559520,5565440,set of mlas inside which is the 47 mlas  inside including the 38 mlas of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5565440,5572320,ships in at 2 pm this afternoon to  strategize their further course of  action now i also asked them about the
pBWp7sZG66o,5572320,5578159,question that there is a possibility  that the deputy speaker could summon you  to appear before him in person at the
pBWp7sZG66o,5578159,5583760,maharashtra legislative assembly to  answer uh on the notices which have been  issued
pBWp7sZG66o,5583760,5589280,against them by of course the ship sena  party in mumbai the 16 rebel mlas and
pBWp7sZG66o,5589280,5596320,what uh i was told by uh sources within  that cap is that we're waiting to see  what the deputy speaker does there is a
pBWp7sZG66o,5596320,5602560,possibility we could go as well but all  of that will only be decided when we
pBWp7sZG66o,5602560,5609120,hear from the deputy speaker and what  sort of uh notice or a summons is issued  to us the deadline of it the timeline
pBWp7sZG66o,5609120,5614320,given etc so on the basis of that we are  going to take a decision we are not
pBWp7sZG66o,5614320,5619920,discounting the possibility that we  might indeed fly down to mumbai  okay so what you're telling us is also
pBWp7sZG66o,5619920,5625280,important here follow me uh there's  going to be a meeting that happens at  2pm so this afternoon perhaps after that
pBWp7sZG66o,5625280,5630320,meeting we'll get clarity on exactly  what the next step of shinde will be but
pBWp7sZG66o,5630320,5637120,you know in your communication with the  shinde camp palmy are they considering  the deputy speaker uh taking note of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5637120,5642739,disqualification petition as a setback  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,5644800,5650960,well uh no they are they were in fact uh  prepared for the same uh  because uh they did realize see this is
pBWp7sZG66o,5650960,5656480,a process that they had of course  thought of in terms of the steps ahead  as to what is exactly going to happen
pBWp7sZG66o,5656480,5662320,when they rebel in this form obviously  there would be an attempt made to  disqualify them first there would be of
pBWp7sZG66o,5662320,5667520,course the attempt made to applicate  them break the ranks bring them back  there could be the possibility that a
pBWp7sZG66o,5667520,5673760,disqualification notice would be moved  against some of them who were indeed  considered eventually by the uh shiva
pBWp7sZG66o,5673760,5679520,sena camp in mumbai as those who will  not return who have rebelled in such a  way that there is a point of no return
pBWp7sZG66o,5679520,5686159,which is reached which is uh possibly  the case with these 16 rebel mlas who've  been identified by the shivsena camp in
pBWp7sZG66o,5686159,5692320,mumbai in order to in order for them to  proceed against them with these  disqualification notices so they're not
pBWp7sZG66o,5692320,5699600,very surprised with the steps that are  being taken unless there is some  surprise  legal step which is taken up by um you
pBWp7sZG66o,5699600,5705440,know the other tac ray cam but at the  moment of course they anticipated this  they did anticipate that the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,5705440,5712719,speaker could possibly uh you know take  these certain measures because of which  they had already moved on the 21st of
pBWp7sZG66o,5712719,5717760,june no confidence motion against the  deputy speaker seeking his removal after
pBWp7sZG66o,5717760,5723840,he in fact accepted the petition or for  the youth of takari faction to remove  aknac shinde as leader of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5723840,5729520,legislature party and appointed audrey  in his place okay apology stay on with  me breaking news that's also coming and
pBWp7sZG66o,5729520,5734880,remember that there's a national  executive meeting of the shift center  that's slated to happen this afternoon
pBWp7sZG66o,5734880,5742560,and india today is getting you the  inside track of what's expected there's  going to be a big big decision taken on
pBWp7sZG66o,5742560,5748159,uh removing eichnach shinde from the  post of party leader this is a very  important post we're being told within
pBWp7sZG66o,5748159,5757119,the ship cena there are only four of  them including the likes of other  theaters so it not shinde was on the  same level as aditya thakuray
pBWp7sZG66o,5758159,5764480,now all of these naitas these party  leaders were appointed by udav takri  directly eight nation they could be
pBWp7sZG66o,5764480,5771040,removed from that particular post  besides that they should say now the  udhav is going to take a decision on the
pBWp7sZG66o,5771040,5777360,kind of stand that they're going to take  against these rebel mlas against every  mla who's chosen shinde uh charlotte
pBWp7sZG66o,5777360,5782800,pavar has reportedly advised to the tar  creek that they need to take an  extremely firm stand against these
pBWp7sZG66o,5782800,5788000,rebels so there could be a decision on  the kind of crackdown against these
pBWp7sZG66o,5788000,5792639,rebel mlas as well in this meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,5793780,5798960,[Music]  let me take this across to dave kotaka
pBWp7sZG66o,5798960,5805119,as well for details about what's  expected in this national executive meet  we're uh hearing dave that there's going
pBWp7sZG66o,5805119,5810239,to be very clear action that's taken  against aknac shinde and also against
pBWp7sZG66o,5810239,5815440,all of the rebel mlas who've chosen to  back shinde there
pBWp7sZG66o,5818480,5825360,well yes absolutely  yesterday the meeting that had happened  at masoda is residents
pBWp7sZG66o,5825360,5833360,the meeting is believed to have been  attended by uh ncp chief and supremo  sharat pawar as well uh also we have
pBWp7sZG66o,5833360,5839600,given to understand the fact  that you know shahrukh pawar has advised  that a form stand be taken against the
pBWp7sZG66o,5839600,5846159,rebel mlas  so let us just quickly try and  understand the fact that you know the
pBWp7sZG66o,5846159,5853360,important points that will be discussed  today is that how to  save the party stature secondly also
pBWp7sZG66o,5853360,5860000,what to do about the mlas who has  rebelled like i mentioned earlier that  firm action should be taken against them
pBWp7sZG66o,5860000,5866080,is something that mr shahrukh power had  suggested also the part where you  discussed about the four leaders what
pBWp7sZG66o,5866080,5871360,they call as neta's three of them are  generally appointed by the chief of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5871360,5875360,party which is mr uttar takari himself
pBWp7sZG66o,5878560,5883600,the fourth leader is his son aditya  takre who was chosen
pBWp7sZG66o,5883600,5890239,after it was put to work so he was  elected by the other party leaders so  there are four neither so uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,5890239,5897920,with ikna shinde uh having to move out  uh we don't know who is going to be  filling in the void yet but for now a
pBWp7sZG66o,5897920,5904480,firm action will be taken against them  and also he has clearly specified the  fact that if required
pBWp7sZG66o,5904480,5910800,if called upon by  you know by the deputy speaker then we  might come back but also some of the
pBWp7sZG66o,5910800,5916000,mlas uh you know we had spoken to  earlier had said that we are not in any
pBWp7sZG66o,5916000,5922159,hurry until this kind of crisis has been  resolved because we don't want to come  back after hearing the false promises
pBWp7sZG66o,5922159,5928560,and then later  you know then later she'll say now turns  back or takes a u-turn uh after the kind
pBWp7sZG66o,5928560,5934159,of promises that it makes so we are  going to completely wait it out until  and unless this has been resolved
pBWp7sZG66o,5934159,5939760,entirely and the the crisis has been put  to bed uh so these are the kind of
pBWp7sZG66o,5939760,5945199,things that we know but of course today  is expected to be a politically packed
pBWp7sZG66o,5945199,5950480,day also and several activities are  expected to go on with either sides
pBWp7sZG66o,5950480,5955920,going back and forth trying to save the  government  from falling however uh you know uh
pBWp7sZG66o,5955920,5961280,shivsena has always argued and stated  the fact that uh including mr sharapova
pBWp7sZG66o,5961280,5968080,who said that this was bjp's third  attempt to topple the government over  they have been trying and him and sanjay
pBWp7sZG66o,5968080,5974800,both of them have assured that bjp come  what may will not be able to form the  government in the state so these are the
pBWp7sZG66o,5974800,5981440,kind of  arguments that have also been made and  statements that have been issued in the  press however later during the day it is
pBWp7sZG66o,5981440,5987040,going to have to be a wait and watch  situation where we have to monitor the  developments uh the poll and the
pBWp7sZG66o,5987040,5994400,political activities that go on very  closely to try and ascertain and  determine uh who will form what uh in in
pBWp7sZG66o,5994400,6000639,in the state so before we kind of uh you  know start uh speculating in any form we
pBWp7sZG66o,6000639,6006080,must go with the flow and like i  mentioned it has got to be a wait and  watch approach so we got to keep a close
pBWp7sZG66o,6006080,6012639,eye out on all the meetings and the  discussions that take place in these  meetings 1pm this national executive
pBWp7sZG66o,6012639,6018960,meeting that udav takri will be chairing  will be happening at 2pm right after  that the shinde camp will be deciding
pBWp7sZG66o,6018960,6025520,their next course of action and we are  getting you the inside details of both  meetings here also the agenda what will
pBWp7sZG66o,6025520,6032080,be the big big takeaway as far as  uddhavsena is concerned they're going to  be deciding on the next step or what
pBWp7sZG66o,6032080,6037280,kind of concrete sizeable action needs  to be taken against take not shinde as
pBWp7sZG66o,6037280,6044560,well as all those mlas have chosen to  back him on the other hand the 2pm meet  by shinde cena will be a decision on
pBWp7sZG66o,6044560,6051360,what's to be done about the deputy  speaker taking up the disqualification  petition that's been issued by udav
pBWp7sZG66o,6051360,6056800,takari so it'll be interesting to see  what are the outcomes of both these  meetings follow me focusing particularly
pBWp7sZG66o,6056800,6062960,on the shinde sena camp uh you know more  action is likely is what we're hearing  against the likes of ignatian day and
pBWp7sZG66o,6062960,6069119,rebel mlas are they worried that you  know any sort of action right now by  udav cena could dent them or do they
pBWp7sZG66o,6069119,6074140,believe that with the numbers on their  side nothing really can deter them
pBWp7sZG66o,6074140,6079199,[Music]  well see uh akshata the fact that they
pBWp7sZG66o,6079199,6085600,do have a two-thirds of uh the  legislative party with them right now uh  that is definitely advantage of the
pBWp7sZG66o,6085600,6092239,eight nation day camp because uh at the  end of the day if you were to uh go  ahead and apply the anti-defection law
pBWp7sZG66o,6092239,6099199,and have anyone disqualified that can't  be possible when they have two-thirds of  the numbers with them they're of course
pBWp7sZG66o,6099199,6105360,uh uh going the other way the shift cena  is basically saying uh that they did not  attend a particular party meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,6105360,6110960,because of which they have voluntarily  given up the membership of the party and  that is the aspect of the tension rule
pBWp7sZG66o,6110960,6116880,of the indian constitution that they are  invoking in order to proceed forward  with these disqualification notices of
pBWp7sZG66o,6116880,6121920,course not shinde says that uh you know  these sort of uh uh this does not apply
pBWp7sZG66o,6121920,6128159,to meetings that are held outside of uh  the precincts or for the assembly it  applies to whims that are issued inside
pBWp7sZG66o,6128159,6135600,uh the assembly and for assembly  proceedings so only that you could be  moving uh this sort of a  disqualification notice uh but there are
pBWp7sZG66o,6135600,6142000,in fact proceedings in the past where it  has in fact impacted those who have in  fact rebelled against the party outside
pBWp7sZG66o,6142000,6147360,as well so there is a lot of uh legal  nuance and how you interpret the law and
pBWp7sZG66o,6147360,6153920,what are the precedents in the law as  well where there are exceptions as well  uh in uh several cases that is going to
pBWp7sZG66o,6153920,6160400,it's going to sort of boil down to that  eventually and that is what it's going  to sort of uh come down to and that is
pBWp7sZG66o,6160400,6165920,why both sides are now legally  strategizing while of course uh uh the  youth of thakura camp is legally
pBWp7sZG66o,6165920,6172639,strategizing with the advocate general  of maharashtra ignatinde is also  consulting uh top lawyers in order to
pBWp7sZG66o,6172639,6180400,ensure that he and his group are secure  and do not attract any sort of attention  uh attract uh action which basically
pBWp7sZG66o,6180400,6186880,disqualifies them from the assembly that  is going to be extremely critical  because no mla who's put in and invested
pBWp7sZG66o,6186880,6192960,so much just two and a half years ago in  terms of resources in terms of effort  and has got elected would like to go
pBWp7sZG66o,6192960,6198080,into another election just two and a  half years later they did not fight the  election for two and a half years they
pBWp7sZG66o,6198080,6204080,contested to stay in uh  in power in uh their seat uh for five
pBWp7sZG66o,6204080,6210800,years so that was not something that  anybody here would like to uh have  happen uh disqualified and then to face
pBWp7sZG66o,6210800,6216080,uh fresh elections and that would in  that sense then would um you know upset  a lot of these mlas they would probably
pBWp7sZG66o,6216080,6222159,go back to the curry camp so that was  something that iknow that kind of  fallout he'll have to contain for the
pBWp7sZG66o,6222159,6228560,moment akshata so that's clearly  something they don't want they don't  want to be disqualified they don't want  to face elections again and that's why
pBWp7sZG66o,6228560,6234000,it not shinde saying i have the numbers  i am exempt from being disqualified and
pBWp7sZG66o,6234000,6239520,he's also in fact tried to highlight  very clearly that he is the real  shivsena because that's happening
pBWp7sZG66o,6239520,6245600,ashutosh i'd like to bring you in on  this because iknow shinde right now is  directly taking on the talk race
pBWp7sZG66o,6245600,6250639,directly taking on their legacy and that  clear you know indication for decades
pBWp7sZG66o,6250639,6256960,now that talk race equals ships you know  shifts in an equal stock race he's  challenging that in view of that in the
pBWp7sZG66o,6256960,6262480,national executive meet is there a  possibility that the extreme step of  suspending a knuckling day could also
pBWp7sZG66o,6262480,6268320,happen there's a question mark on that  because in the last few days despite  this all-out rebellion the shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,6268320,6276159,udav takri has never directly slammed or  taken on eight nation day will that  change starting today
pBWp7sZG66o,6278400,6283760,absolutely absolutely and that's exactly  why the national executive meeting  called and what it seems to be the point
pBWp7sZG66o,6283760,6290320,number one it is the sharat pawar who's  calling the shots all advices and his  legislative experience that seems to be
pBWp7sZG66o,6290320,6296000,reflecting in the decision that the  coalition government and particularly  shiv cena alone as far as the party uh
pBWp7sZG66o,6296000,6301360,internal affairs are concerned are being  seen so that's the influence of  calling the national executive meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,6301360,6308320,before that addressing the carder  suddenly you see that deserted mato shri  day day before has seeing a huge crowd
pBWp7sZG66o,6308320,6313440,of the supporters but the party like  shiv sena which is you know restrained  to be the urban constituencies of
pBWp7sZG66o,6313440,6320000,maharashtra suddenly you see the  supporters coming in huge number you're  also seeing the protest the warning  being issued indirect warning to the
pBWp7sZG66o,6320000,6326080,rebel so all these seems to be the  influence of power again calling the  national executive meeting and uh
pBWp7sZG66o,6326080,6333199,throwing out ignacinda and the rebels  from the body that gives the power to uh  the target to hold at least the grip on
pBWp7sZG66o,6333199,6338960,the shiv cena because at the moment the  shiva cena belongs to the  ignacio on the floor of the house having
pBWp7sZG66o,6338960,6344159,the number can only claim but that the  legislative part and that will happen  later ultimately because there's a
pBWp7sZG66o,6344159,6350560,window of  you know the interpretation which  remains open it will be ultimately  decided by uh the court so the point
pBWp7sZG66o,6350560,6356800,number one it is the sharapova who's  calling the shots point number two there  is also concern in the aknash in the
pBWp7sZG66o,6356800,6362400,camp as well as you heard polymer so you  know there of course the mls will be  worried whether they want to go for the
pBWp7sZG66o,6362400,6367679,election there have been  uh certain presidents where the mla is  even out of the legislative process by
pBWp7sZG66o,6367679,6373760,violating the whip have been uh  disqualified so there will be some and  that's exactly why the legal uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,6373760,6379040,suggestions are being obtained point  number three of course there is a  concern in the mva that they are losing
pBWp7sZG66o,6379040,6384880,the government but what if the shift  cena also breaks away so end up that's  exactly why this all optics and battle
pBWp7sZG66o,6384880,6391600,on the street up you're seeing but it  will be also for the ncp and the  congress that if the government falls uh
pBWp7sZG66o,6391600,6397040,shiv cena breaks out what is their  future within two and a half just like  for the next election are they really
pBWp7sZG66o,6397040,6403199,prepared for the next course of  political battle so clearly it is not  one-sided but almost both this side be
pBWp7sZG66o,6403199,6408800,the rebel or the existing government  party there is a concern and they all  are choosing their legal battle for now
pBWp7sZG66o,6408800,6415199,ultimately it will be a legal battle at  last what we see what's very clear from  the news break also that we're putting  out the inside details of the cena
pBWp7sZG66o,6415199,6420960,national executive meet is that perhaps  has woken up smelt the coffee and  realized that there's no way these
pBWp7sZG66o,6420960,6426719,rebels are going to come back to me and  that's why they're finally deciding to  take concrete action against these rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,6426719,6432320,mlas as well which they've shied away  from remember even in the  disqualification petition only 16 rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,6432320,6437440,mla's names have been taken not all of  them not 38 of them will that change now
pBWp7sZG66o,6437440,6444000,is the question mark will udoptery  realize that these mlas are gone these  rebels aren't coming back to the camp
pBWp7sZG66o,6444000,6450639,and so take action against them let's  round up for you this morning all the  latest updates that have come in on the

pBWp7sZG66o,6598080,6604800,the kill udav taker is also digging in  his heels hitting out at the shinde camp  saying that nobody can separate the
pBWp7sZG66o,6604800,6609079,takaras from the shiv cena
pBWp7sZG66o,6611199,6618610,which is the real shift cena  who will inherit balasab takray's legacy

pBWp7sZG66o,6638960,6641440,of shift
pBWp7sZG66o,6664719,6670159,one thing is clear a split in shift sena  is now inevitable
pBWp7sZG66o,6670159,6678239,shinde and 37 mlas have broken rank from  the uddhav sena they are now the  majority leaving the original shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,6678239,6683280,to be reduced to a minority party  and now
pBWp7sZG66o,6683280,6689040,shinde sena is moving in for the kill by  laying claim to the bow and arrow symbol

pBWp7sZG66o,6705350,6710639,[Music]  is digging in his heels hitting out at

pBWp7sZG66o,6739440,6746880,the matter can be only decided by the  election commission  election commission will also decide on
pBWp7sZG66o,6746880,6754880,allotment of party symbol on set rules  if not shinde seeks official recognition
pBWp7sZG66o,6755679,6760800,till then the war of words war for  legacy and the war for power will only

pBWp7sZG66o,6820320,6827199,there's a high stake contest going on  over the indo-pacific region  chinese fighter jets have started to
pBWp7sZG66o,6827199,6832800,regularly threaten us allies  and the experts are fearing a repeat of
pBWp7sZG66o,6832800,6840080,the 2001 incident  where a chinese fighter jet clashed with  a u.s navy aircraft
pBWp7sZG66o,6840080,6846560,what are these chinese warplanes doing  it was reported that chinese warplanes  regularly buzzed a canadian
pBWp7sZG66o,6846560,6852239,reconnaissance plane monitoring north  korea the crew was forced to alter
pBWp7sZG66o,6852239,6857280,course to avoid a collision in another  instance the chinese fighter jets fired
pBWp7sZG66o,6857280,6863760,metallic shaft across the course of an  australian surveillance aircraft
pBWp7sZG66o,6863760,6871599,the chinese officials praised its pilots  for these maneuvers and stated that they  were defending the country's sovereignty
pBWp7sZG66o,6871599,6876719,experts think that targeting u.s allies  such as canada and australia might be a
pBWp7sZG66o,6876719,6884719,means to investigate the coalition's  weaknesses  this is not the first time they have  tried to buzz past u.s allies
pBWp7sZG66o,6884719,6892320,most recently chinese fighter jets flew  close to a canadian surveillance plane  60 such reports of interceptions were
pBWp7sZG66o,6892320,6898719,noticed by canadian aircraft  but why are they targeting u.s allies  and not the u.s
pBWp7sZG66o,6898719,6905599,experts think that the intimidation is  to drive a wedge between the u.s and its  allies the u.s depends on its allies in
pBWp7sZG66o,6905599,6913119,scenarios like supporting economic  sanctions or a ground war and china  intimidating u.s allies sends a clear
pBWp7sZG66o,6913119,6920159,message  that the allies will face chinese  aggression if they support the us
pBWp7sZG66o,6920159,6926000,this seems like a strategy to demoralize  and weaken the us allies and partners

pBWp7sZG66o,6970880,6977440,crea showed that its oil export revenue  so to 98 billion dollars
pBWp7sZG66o,6977440,6982880,this record high revenue comes during  the first hundred days of russia's  invasion of ukraine
pBWp7sZG66o,6982880,6990320,as per the report here are the top  clients for russian oil the first on the  list is china scoring 12.6 billion euros
pBWp7sZG66o,6990320,6997599,worth of gas and oil  germany is next on the list with 12.1  billion euros worth of oil and gas and

pBWp7sZG66o,10066240,10072479,for the first time he's actually giving  it back daring iknow shinde saying why  are you sitting in guwahati why are you
pBWp7sZG66o,10072479,10079040,sitting outside maharashtra come to  mumbai come face us face us in the  assembly show us your numbers and that

pBWp7sZG66o,10085680,10091359,course the reference to of course what  played out in bengal and the war of  words between the tmc and the bjp so
pBWp7sZG66o,10091359,10097760,essentially picking up a chapter from  mumta's book sanjay rao hitting back  there and saying that the game has just
pBWp7sZG66o,10097760,10104240,begun here you have now the uttav cena  seeming to think that they are back in  the game because of the fact that their
pBWp7sZG66o,10104240,10110880,disqualification petition perhaps has  been accepted by the deputy speaker dave  kotak is joining us with more details on
pBWp7sZG66o,10110880,10117120,this dave sanjay rao's last few days was  referring to iknow as a dose as a mithra
pBWp7sZG66o,10117120,10124080,there's a complete change in the tone  that's being used right now sanjay rao  saying come to mumbai come face us
pBWp7sZG66o,10124080,10129320,directly if you have the guts  aperture bada
pBWp7sZG66o,10129320,10135439,[Music]  yeah  so  you saw a much more aggressive
pBWp7sZG66o,10135439,10141359,sanjay route  from the shiv cena for the first time  he's giving it back this does not
pBWp7sZG66o,10141359,10146800,show that he has been affected by all of  the political crisis that is going on in
pBWp7sZG66o,10146800,10153439,the state but he clearly said you know  roaring like a lie and he said that mr  fardner is we are not scared of this but
pBWp7sZG66o,10153439,10159600,we just need you to not get involved at  the same time we respect you but this is  a dirty game don't embroil yourself in
pBWp7sZG66o,10159600,10166560,all of this she or  mr routh also mentioned the fact that he  made a clear statement saying khala hobe
pBWp7sZG66o,10166560,10174240,which means game on let's play uh you  know this is a direct reference which  mamta banerjee and also these are the
pBWp7sZG66o,10174240,10181680,words uttered by the west bengal cm you  know when they were squared off in a  direct contest against the bjp in the
pBWp7sZG66o,10181680,10187279,during the west bengal election  however mr sanjay route also said that
pBWp7sZG66o,10187279,10193520,this uh engaging in this kind of  behavior where you're running around  from pillar to post you know mlas who
pBWp7sZG66o,10193520,10199680,are so dignified and respect and well  respected you know and then to from a  state like maharashtra running around
pBWp7sZG66o,10199680,10205040,from uh from gujarat to gohati and then  to god alone knows where the next
pBWp7sZG66o,10205040,10210880,destination would be you know he did  saying that prove the numbers show that  you have the majority and the strength
pBWp7sZG66o,10210880,10218399,when the floor test happens uh but come  back to bombay let's talk it out you  know uh this does not suit uh the mem
pBWp7sZG66o,10218399,10225600,the mlas of a state  who have been elected and you know they  are members of some stature and some
pBWp7sZG66o,10225600,10231760,repute so you know engaging in this kind  of behavior is only giving a bad name  and reputation to the state of
pBWp7sZG66o,10231760,10238160,maharashtra he also made a reference  and uh told uh mr devin rafatnam is the
pBWp7sZG66o,10238160,10245600,former chief minister of maharashtra  saying that  you know taking a jibe at him saying  that what you had done in the morning is
pBWp7sZG66o,10245600,10251279,also not cool uh because he we remember  that mr devin the  was sworn in as the chief minister of
pBWp7sZG66o,10251279,10256319,maharashtra very early in the morning at  about 6 6 15 a.m at the rajba one at the
pBWp7sZG66o,10256319,10263200,governor's house in mumbai and of course  after that we know that the mba  government came into power because
pBWp7sZG66o,10263200,10268880,i'm just i'm just interrupting you here  because we're getting in another big  news breaker on this story there's
pBWp7sZG66o,10268880,10274080,another a letter that ignored shinde has  put forth with the signature of 38
pBWp7sZG66o,10274080,10280160,shivsena mlas he's again flexing muscles  showing that he has the numbers but  here's what shinde said in this letter
pBWp7sZG66o,10280160,10286319,which has been signed off by all the  mla's backing him that there are  attempts being made uh by other parties
pBWp7sZG66o,10286319,10292399,to leo shrivesena emilies he's also gone  on to claim at this point that his
pBWp7sZG66o,10292399,10298960,security all the mla is backing him  their security has been withdrawn by the  chief minister and going on to put the
pBWp7sZG66o,10298960,10304000,honours on  saying that is the responsibility of the  maharashtra government to ensure our
pBWp7sZG66o,10304000,10310399,security vidya is joining us live from  mumbai with more details on this video  throw more light on exactly what's been
pBWp7sZG66o,10310399,10315760,mentioned in this letter been written by  iknow shinde of course signed off by 38
pBWp7sZG66o,10315760,10319960,mla so stand with him today
pBWp7sZG66o,10321040,10328000,uh well at this moment  what he's saying is that the you know  he's there the mls have been in touch
pBWp7sZG66o,10328000,10334000,with their family members as well as  their supporters and with from them they  have gotten to know that the security
pBWp7sZG66o,10334000,10340960,that uh had been given to them in the  last two and a half years that has been  withdrawn up this and because of this
pBWp7sZG66o,10340960,10347760,remember in the last couple of 24 hours  at least we have seen not just attacks  on the posters like posters uh in nasik
pBWp7sZG66o,10347760,10352800,where the torn in kolapu there have been  huge protests in tarne in mumbai as well
pBWp7sZG66o,10352800,10357920,there are incidents of uh you know the  mla's offices being attacked  with
pBWp7sZG66o,10357920,10363040,this in view the aikna shinde camp says  that in case something really happens to
pBWp7sZG66o,10363040,10368800,the families and supporters of  of nachindi then the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,10368800,10374080,government that is right now chief  minister would be held responsible for  it so at this juncture they're very
pBWp7sZG66o,10374080,10379359,clear that because they are responsible  for the withdrawal of the security so it
pBWp7sZG66o,10379359,10386399,is  a you know  who is responsible for if anything  untoward really happens to them okay

pBWp7sZG66o,10539520,10544880,is usually slight for example tiles  might be blown off the roof but level 5

pBWp7sZG66o,10945279,10952160,minister for him as well as all the  other rebels who've chosen to side with  him he's also acclaimed that other
pBWp7sZG66o,10952160,10960160,parties are trying now to lure shift  sera emelia's ignacion they putting the  honors directly on udav takre in that

pBWp7sZG66o,10972240,10977680,shinde in that letter also making a  mention of attacks of incidents of
pBWp7sZG66o,10977680,10984398,violence that have been reported in  maharashtra after he kicked off his  rebellion
pBWp7sZG66o,10985840,10991680,let's take this across to vidya she's  joining us live from mumbai with more  details on this so vidya you've got ekna
pBWp7sZG66o,10991680,10996800,shinde now taking on udav takri directly  he's claimed and alleged that security
pBWp7sZG66o,10996800,11005561,has been withdrawn for him as well as  all the other mlas 38 of them have  chosen to back him from the ship cena
pBWp7sZG66o,11006720,11014000,oh well this is what exactly he said  although outside his own residence we  have been seeing uh the security that
pBWp7sZG66o,11014000,11020399,had been uh you know beefed up since the  entire incident uh but then certainly  you know the other mlas will have to
pBWp7sZG66o,11020399,11026720,really check as to what the position is  but certainly as he is claiming uh the  security has been withdrawn and it could
pBWp7sZG66o,11026720,11033359,be a part of the entire strategy that  the  the other running la's have been uh
pBWp7sZG66o,11033359,11037438,but a  meeting since yesterday
pBWp7sZG66o,11042560,11048319,okay i'm going to reconnect with you i'm  going to reconnect that line with you  we're having a bit of a problem there  with your connection i'll bring in
pBWp7sZG66o,11048319,11055520,diversity in the meanwhile who's also  joining us live on this divish sanjay  route firing a fresh attack at eight not
pBWp7sZG66o,11055520,11063840,shinde saying if you're there come to  mumbai and on the other hand iknow  saying provide a security first
pBWp7sZG66o,11064540,11070800,[Music]  well yes uh sanjay routh a while ago he
pBWp7sZG66o,11070800,11077920,spoke to media and he has claimed that  there are various shifts and ships in  our workers who are coming from various
pBWp7sZG66o,11077920,11085520,parts of the state from far off  districts in the state and he also went  on to say that they are asking them the
pBWp7sZG66o,11085520,11090880,are they asking senior leaders or what  to be done next but though sanjay route
pBWp7sZG66o,11090880,11097040,said that he they the senior leadership  of cena has asked everyone to stay calm
pBWp7sZG66o,11097040,11104080,but he again went on to say that if  shifts come on the roads if they take  two roads that they will not be
pBWp7sZG66o,11104080,11112000,responsible he also went on to say that  uh chef cynics could take two roads and  that general alert had been issued by
pBWp7sZG66o,11112000,11119760,police officials across various  districts across  especially across mumbai in
pBWp7sZG66o,11119760,11124960,a section 144 has been imposed uh  particular weapons are not being allowed
pBWp7sZG66o,11124960,11131880,to be carried particular objects are not  allowed to be carried in  remember
pBWp7sZG66o,11142479,11148399,in mumbai also have been asked to keep a  close eye on movements of shift sets so
pBWp7sZG66o,11148399,11154880,that there is no underworld incident  that happens there is no law and order  situation that erupts in the city just
pBWp7sZG66o,11154880,11161920,stay with me because even as we're  tracking all of this that's happening  within the cena  what about the bjp what is the bjp doing
pBWp7sZG66o,11161920,11167120,here well devendra fatnevis is set to be  meeting with all of the bjp's allies in
pBWp7sZG66o,11167120,11173120,maharashtra any moment now fatnevis will  be meeting with ramdas at havely and all
pBWp7sZG66o,11173120,11178399,other allies as well mla's bhangdiya as  well as ravel have reached fortnight's
pBWp7sZG66o,11178399,11183760,residence the top bjp mlas are also part  of this particular meeting the bjp
pBWp7sZG66o,11183760,11188800,essentially has been playing a wait and  watch game right now they're waiting to
pBWp7sZG66o,11188800,11194960,see how things play out the last time  around the bjp jumped the gun it was  extremely humiliating for them they've
pBWp7sZG66o,11194960,11200720,learned lessons from that which is why  right now you don't see them poking  their notes in any way despite everyone
pBWp7sZG66o,11200720,11205760,talking about this rebellion being a  result of operation kamla operation
pBWp7sZG66o,11205760,11211200,lotus by the bjp whatnos is holding a  slew of meetings today at any moment now
pBWp7sZG66o,11211200,11218240,the meeting with in fact the allies of  maharashtra will kick off but the bjp no  doubt will be figuring out what this
pBWp7sZG66o,11218240,11226399,will mean for them and how they can make  the most of this rebellion and this  all-out war within the shiv cena
pBWp7sZG66o,11228399,11233520,let's take this back across to video  four more so with your a number of  meetings that will be happening today in
pBWp7sZG66o,11233520,11238800,about two hours from now the shift  center at the utah center at least will  be holding a meeting after that the
pBWp7sZG66o,11238800,11244960,shinde sena also holding a strategy  meeting but the reason the bjp huddle is  going to be crucial is because we'll
pBWp7sZG66o,11244960,11250640,know in the hours to come whether the  bjp changes its strategy whether they  decide that now it's safe for them to
pBWp7sZG66o,11250640,11256840,come out and try to also push for the  outstore for the taqueria
pBWp7sZG66o,11258080,11264640,uh well remember the deputy speaker has  already received the application that uh  you know that was filed by the shivsena
pBWp7sZG66o,11264640,11269920,led by other to cancel the uh you know  the election of the nomination of these
pBWp7sZG66o,11269920,11276080,uh 12 to 16 people of the aknach hindi  led camp and before that really happens
pBWp7sZG66o,11276080,11283120,you know a decision is taken remember  the deputy speaker will be showing a  notice to these 12 16 people and asking
pBWp7sZG66o,11283120,11289520,them to file a reply obviously to and  fro much hearing will have to happen  before a decision is taken
pBWp7sZG66o,11289520,11295439,at this juncture you know the uh the  iknac hindi led camp certainly does not  want to delay any further they already
pBWp7sZG66o,11295439,11302000,have 38 signatures that means that they  already have the party in their hand  obviously it does mean a whole lot of
pBWp7sZG66o,11302000,11308560,paperwork that would entail at the  election commission as well as you know  at the assembly but right now with just
pBWp7sZG66o,11308560,11316000,these numbers in hand  they want to make a move at the earliest  while on the other hand the shifts and
pBWp7sZG66o,11316000,11323680,unless  wants to delay it uh  they want to see to it that they their  their you know the mla is at goatee get
pBWp7sZG66o,11323680,11330560,tired out want to come back under threat  under any kind of pre-text they would be  you know the moment they are here they
pBWp7sZG66o,11330560,11336160,would join some of them would join hands  with  the lead chief sena is what most of the
pBWp7sZG66o,11336160,11343120,shift sanics believe and that's the  reason as the also has been saying come  to mumbai talk to us right now on the
pBWp7sZG66o,11343120,11348240,face and then take a decision so  certainly at this juncture with the  iknac
pBWp7sZG66o,11348240,11353920,gang not really succumbing to that offer  wanting to stay back in gowahati at some
pBWp7sZG66o,11353920,11359520,point these people will really have to  come back to  the test on the floor and as uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,11359520,11365920,sanjay rauth has also been stating very  clearly since here that everything will  depend on the floor of the house because
pBWp7sZG66o,11365920,11372560,everyone here knows that the issue will  finally be settled on the floor of the  house but it is only a time which will
pBWp7sZG66o,11372560,11377840,tell as to when it will really happen  uh with your stay on with me i'm going  to come back to you in a few moments
pBWp7sZG66o,11377840,11385439,from now let's discuss  the uddhav sena strategy here udav takre  at 1pm today will be holding a national
pBWp7sZG66o,11385439,11390720,executive meet and india today is the  inside track of what's really expected  in this meeting it's going to be perhaps
pBWp7sZG66o,11390720,11395920,the decisive one as far as the udhav  senate is concerned because finally  they've decided that they're going to
pBWp7sZG66o,11395920,11401040,take the fight back to eknat shinde udaf  thakrei is likely to remove ekna shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,11401040,11406399,as a party neta what that means is  essentially a party leader there are  only four of those in the shift saying
pBWp7sZG66o,11406399,11413840,it includes the likes of other theaters  it's a very senior post in the party  udhav is also expected to discuss action
pBWp7sZG66o,11413840,11421200,against all the rebels against the mlas  who've chosen to back iknow shinde  rather than him reportedly ncp chief
pBWp7sZG66o,11421200,11427680,sharok pavar has suggested that this  shift say that udav takri take a tough  stand against rebels and ekna shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,11427680,11432880,which so far would have shied away from  doing this even as shinde cena will be
pBWp7sZG66o,11432880,11438080,holding a crucial meeting at 2pm to  decide whether they're going to make  their way back to mumbai and how to
pBWp7sZG66o,11438080,11443438,respond if the deputy speaker issues a  notice to them

pBWp7sZG66o,11524399,11530319,currently mr jaiswal thank you for  joining us here on india today not sure  if you heard what sanjay rao just said
pBWp7sZG66o,11530319,11536080,he's saying that if you want to take us  on come to mumbai why are you sitting in  guwahati

pBWp7sZG66o,11727600,11735040,thank you for joining us here on india  today so that's uh uh ashi jaiswal who  is with in fact not shinde in guwahati
pBWp7sZG66o,11735040,11741120,saying that we will very soon come to  mumbai but he's also said very clearly  that if the deputy speaker takes any
pBWp7sZG66o,11741120,11746880,step it will not hold and they've said  that they're willing to take this to  court if the deputy speaker acts
pBWp7sZG66o,11746880,11752720,considering that the shinde sena  strategy here is to go ahead and move on  no conference motion which they've
pBWp7sZG66o,11752720,11758720,already done against the deputy speaker  and their contention is that if that  kind of emotion is passed the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,11758720,11766319,speaker cannot afford to take any  decisions with regards to  disqualification so that's their clear  legal strategy here as well let's in
pBWp7sZG66o,11766319,11772800,fact bring in also deviate singh who's  joining us live on this broadcast divish  uh we just played uh and we just got
pBWp7sZG66o,11772800,11779359,ashi jaiswal to join us here on this  broadcast and this message is very clear  that we're in no rush to come to mumbai
pBWp7sZG66o,11779359,11785760,they're going to stick to their strategy  so any dare that's issued by sanjay  rauth isn't going to work as far as ekna
pBWp7sZG66o,11785760,11790120,shinde and fazing him is concerned
pBWp7sZG66o,11792479,11799279,well sanjay routh maintains that  whatever demands whatever allegations  are being leveled by the rebel group by
pBWp7sZG66o,11799279,11804880,ignac shinde and by his allies regarding  beat regarding security be it regarding
pBWp7sZG66o,11804880,11810000,uh the gr's being passed be it regarding  any other issues they need to come back
pBWp7sZG66o,11810000,11817200,to mumbai and then talk  sanji rauth had also hinted that once  these mlas come back they could join
pBWp7sZG66o,11817200,11822399,they could join back the shiv cena and  uh they would not go against the primary
pBWp7sZG66o,11822399,11827680,party they could they would not go  against udav  shiv sena that is what sanjay routh has
pBWp7sZG66o,11827680,11834399,been claiming but he also went on to say  that if these mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,11834399,11841120,who the rebel mlas come back and decide  to stay against the udav cena then it
pBWp7sZG66o,11841120,11847279,they would also find it difficult to  roam around in the state so that is also  being mentioned in the letter that was
pBWp7sZG66o,11847279,11852880,sent by iknack where he says that such  kind of threats are being issued uh to
pBWp7sZG66o,11852880,11859920,the rebel group to the rebel mlas by  sanjay rauth and other people other than  that the national executive meeting of
pBWp7sZG66o,11859920,11865279,shifts in is going to happen this  afternoon where we hear from our sources  that
pBWp7sZG66o,11865279,11871680,iknow  ramdas kadam and few others are going to  be removed from the leadership
pBWp7sZG66o,11871680,11878479,of the party decision will be taken  regarding that few new people will be  placed on the same designation uh there
pBWp7sZG66o,11878479,11884560,are other new decisions as sanjay rao  pointed out that the new decisions which  would be taken and further course of
pBWp7sZG66o,11884560,11890239,action will be decided  okay we're also getting in information  we'll be putting that out on our screens
pBWp7sZG66o,11890239,11895520,also very clo very soon that the shift  center is in fact udav senior at least
pBWp7sZG66o,11895520,11900800,is fearing that more leaders are now  choosing ekna shinde over uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,11900800,11908319,so in that national executive meet that  happens in less than two hours from now  we're expecting that even senior leaders
pBWp7sZG66o,11908319,11914479,like ramdas khadav could face the acts  could face action from shivsena he's a
pBWp7sZG66o,11914479,11920560,very senior leader he's held a  ministerial portfolio as well before uh  at this point when we asked him a
pBWp7sZG66o,11920560,11926800,question about whether he's going to be  facing and attending this national  executive meet he didn't comment and it
pBWp7sZG66o,11926800,11933920,looks like in all likelihood he also  fears that he is staring right now at  action uh considering that his son
pBWp7sZG66o,11933920,11940239,yogesh kadam has already gone to go a  hearty he is with eknar shinde right now  so that is also an update that we're
pBWp7sZG66o,11940239,11945040,going to be putting out right now for  our viewers vidya
pBWp7sZG66o,11946080,11951279,which is where this meeting will be  happening with there we're hearing that  it's rebel mlas who there'll be action
pBWp7sZG66o,11951279,11956960,against iknow shinde will face action as  well as several other leaders who are at
pBWp7sZG66o,11956960,11963600,this point clearly subtly extending  support to ignore shinde the likes of  ramdas kadam
pBWp7sZG66o,11965840,11972080,in fact uh you know this entire national  executive meeting is being held after uh  you know various other rounds of meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,11972080,11978800,that has happened with all the kare  kartas of shivsena who came from across  maharashtra and it is because of this
pBWp7sZG66o,11978800,11983920,that after gauging the mood of those uh  caricatures that the party has really
pBWp7sZG66o,11983920,11989600,decided to you know set up this entire  national executive meet which will be  held at around one o'clock huge led
pBWp7sZG66o,11989600,11994640,screens are being uh put up where  they're obviously uh would be addressing
pBWp7sZG66o,11994640,12000880,virtually while the rest of the people  will be here right here at the shift  center and right here there is expected
pBWp7sZG66o,12000880,12006080,that there will be strong measures that  will be taken which would really point  out to the shiv sena that the party
pBWp7sZG66o,12006080,12013600,still exists without the mlas the party  might not have representation in the  assembly but this party will stand back
pBWp7sZG66o,12013600,12020239,the way it had earlier as well like when  the likes of chagan goodwill for example  are the iranis who took more than dozen
pBWp7sZG66o,12020239,12026000,mls with him with them when they left  the party but still the party stood  that's ground and that's the kind of
pBWp7sZG66o,12026000,12031680,picture that the  is really want to put across even today  and it's not just uh you know today i
pBWp7sZG66o,12031680,12038800,mean there are and this after this  national executive meet there are  various others  who is now emerging with his father
pBWp7sZG66o,12038800,12046080,being you know unwell he is now emerging  as the person who will take the party  ahead with uh various other he's got a
pBWp7sZG66o,12046080,12051279,you know a public meeting today later in  the evening so uh the chakras are taking
pBWp7sZG66o,12051279,12058239,on the mlas by putting up a posturing  that has been done that we can exist  even without you probably the kind when
pBWp7sZG66o,12058239,12065279,you come back the you will not find the  supporters that you want for uh while  you claim that you are their leader is
pBWp7sZG66o,12065279,12070560,there is there a change in tone with  your uh you know i'm seeing that the  udav sena at least in their response
pBWp7sZG66o,12070560,12075680,even from what sanji rao has said they  seem to have decided to become more  aggressive last few days they've been
pBWp7sZG66o,12075680,12081680,very mellow in their response to aiknot  shinde have they perhaps realized that  there's no question of these mlas coming
pBWp7sZG66o,12081680,12087199,back and so they've decided now to go  all out take action crack the whip
pBWp7sZG66o,12089120,12094399,up remember you know on the first day  itself when uh  had realized that the mlas were not
pBWp7sZG66o,12094399,12100319,around uh he immediately put out appeals  that you know there was that emotional  appeal which was never the way the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,12100319,12106160,cena would have reacted uh that  emotional appeal actually showed shifts  you know
pBWp7sZG66o,12106160,12113120,in a light which which not many shiver  sanics had really seen the thak rays as  they had always seen takrez as attacking
pBWp7sZG66o,12113120,12119680,someone who would take harsh decisions  and that's the reason why  when uh realized that it wasn't really
pBWp7sZG66o,12119680,12126560,working that the party has now decided  to take the you know the difficult route  but it will certainly give them much
pBWp7sZG66o,12126560,12132720,more fruit is what they expect because  probably not now you know when they will  not be able to probably form the
pBWp7sZG66o,12132720,12139120,government again  probably there might be a setback but  later on with the new caddo coming in is
pBWp7sZG66o,12139120,12144560,what they are planning to do that the  new carrier will be put up which would  face uh you know the new elections that
pBWp7sZG66o,12144560,12150560,would happen later but at this juncture  obviously you know uh the national  executive meet here right here at the
pBWp7sZG66o,12150560,12155600,shift center is of extreme importance  because here some very primary important
pBWp7sZG66o,12155600,12160720,meetings will be taken in and and as uh  diverse was pointing out
pBWp7sZG66o,12160720,12166160,you know kadam might not really come  here because his son is in gohati he
pBWp7sZG66o,12166160,12171520,probably he's a member of the national  executive meet but he might probably not  uh because he will have to face the
pBWp7sZG66o,12171520,12178080,entire wrath of the taqways so that's  the reason he is probably not going to  come though uh everyone is looking
pBWp7sZG66o,12178080,12184160,forward to who all will be at england  probably apart from kadam and ignacion  day others will certainly be here
pBWp7sZG66o,12184160,12189279,okay so ramdas kadam is likely to be  removed from the party he's been  non-committal on attending that meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,12189279,12196479,as vidya and i have been discussing also  for the last few minutes so there could  be some big steps being taken in that
pBWp7sZG66o,12196479,12203120,national executive meet uh chaired by  udafrakri at 1pm any nether seen to be
pBWp7sZG66o,12203120,12211040,uh on it not shinde side will be axed  and it looks like ramdas kadam a very  senior shivsena leader could also be
pBWp7sZG66o,12211040,12218000,removed from the party and at this point  we have not been able to get any comment  from ramdas kadam on whether he will
pBWp7sZG66o,12218000,12223040,attend the national executive meet or  not all right let's take this across now  to paula misaha she's joining us live

pBWp7sZG66o,12235760,12241760,point as we count down to the meeting  the national executive meeting uh by uh

pBWp7sZG66o,12881560,12886800,[Applause]  welcome back you're joining us here on
pBWp7sZG66o,12886800,12893200,our non-stop coverage of the maharashtra  political crisis udav takre all eyes are  on the maharashtra chief minister to see
pBWp7sZG66o,12893200,12898319,what his next move is he's at this point  at least seemingly lost the number game
pBWp7sZG66o,12898319,12904960,and here's why i say that let's break  down for you the latest number tally  shiv cena's numbers are dwindling you
pBWp7sZG66o,12904960,12910880,can see here that udav cena's down to  the teens at 17 and while eknot shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,12910880,12917040,and his camp is growing 38 cena mlas  alone are with the economy besides that
pBWp7sZG66o,12917040,12923120,nine mlas these are independents as well  as mlas from smaller parties who are  with eknar shinde that increases his
pBWp7sZG66o,12923120,12928720,number to 47. and you look at how  shuseen has dwindled there to just 17.
pBWp7sZG66o,12928720,12934160,that means overall trouble for the  mahavika sagari while the congress and  ncp's number remains the same the
pBWp7sZG66o,12934160,12941120,problem is that the agari's overall  numbers have completely dropped because  of this rebellion by shinde the strategy
pBWp7sZG66o,12941120,12948319,what we're hearing from our sources of  ignacion day is to join hands with the  bjp and the bjp with 106 odd seats
pBWp7sZG66o,12948319,12953359,already and adding this number to this  will be comfortably in place to go ahead
pBWp7sZG66o,12953359,12960000,and grab the cm throne let's take this  across now to palmy sahara she's joining  us live from goaharty with the latest
pBWp7sZG66o,12960000,12966080,updates on this follow me ignacion they  may have the numbers but there's still a  big question mark on what's going to
pBWp7sZG66o,12966080,12972720,happen next particularly with the deputy  speaker deciding the next course of  action the dare from sanjay routh is
pBWp7sZG66o,12972720,12979040,clear here you know the senate seems to  become a lot more aggressive sanjay rao  has told ekna shinde directly if you've
pBWp7sZG66o,12979040,12984080,got the numbers come to mumbai while  you're sitting in guwahati is that  something that's expected will iknow
pBWp7sZG66o,12984080,12990239,shinde respond by taking all of his mlas  to mumbai next
pBWp7sZG66o,12992960,12999120,well uh what we're uh what we understand  uh from uh our sources uh within the day  camp and also those we're speaking to in
pBWp7sZG66o,12999120,13006160,mumbai as well who are of course  strategizing for the urduftari camp is  uh that uh when of course uh the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,13006160,13012720,speaker issues the summons to these 16  rebel mlas are based on the  disqualification a motion which has been
pBWp7sZG66o,13012720,13017760,moved against them by uh the odaf takari  led shiva cena he will give them the
pBWp7sZG66o,13017760,13024080,option to either appear in person or  submit a reply via email but from an
pBWp7sZG66o,13024080,13032080,authentic email address which can be  authenticated and verified as uh that  offer this uh concerned mla itself so
pBWp7sZG66o,13032080,13038319,the option will be available so they  don't necessarily have to need uh need  to go down to mumbai in order to of
pBWp7sZG66o,13038319,13044479,course present their case before the  deputy speaker that is what we  understand and this is from the takari  camp itself so they're saying that the
pBWp7sZG66o,13044479,13050880,options are actually two over there but  of course then the prerogative lies with  the deputy speaker and whether he
pBWp7sZG66o,13050880,13057520,accepts the response whether he thinks  of it as uh something which is valid uh  in terms of them having not attended
pBWp7sZG66o,13057520,13062880,that uh meeting of the party which was  called and where of course because of  which that disqualification notice has
pBWp7sZG66o,13062880,13068640,been issued against them if the deputy  speaker of course considered it  considers it uh
pBWp7sZG66o,13068640,13075279,invalid and the response not  satisfactory he could move uh to in fact  disqualify these the mlas that is
pBWp7sZG66o,13075279,13081680,possible and there is in fact precedent  where this has happened in the case of  of course uh mlas who have of course uh
pBWp7sZG66o,13081680,13087840,uh gone against the party line so to say  even outside uh the assembly or the  parliament for that instant though of
pBWp7sZG66o,13087840,13093359,course the ignacion de camp believes  that no that is not the case and then  schedule of the constitution uh doesn't
pBWp7sZG66o,13093359,13100720,allow for you to act against any sort of  anti-party activities as you may deem  outside of the assembly now it all boils
pBWp7sZG66o,13100720,13106239,down to your understanding of the  tension deal of the constitution so how  we see it play out right now from here
pBWp7sZG66o,13106239,13112479,on akshata is that there's a possibility  that he could uh not find some of those  responses or all of those responses
pBWp7sZG66o,13112479,13117600,unsatisfactory if indeed he does receive  responses uh from the 16 rebel mlas and
pBWp7sZG66o,13117600,13123279,he couldn't proceed to disqualify them  in that case the shinde faction could  then move the court challenging that
pBWp7sZG66o,13123279,13129920,disqualification so this is definitely  going the legal way in terms of ending  up in a courtroom
pBWp7sZG66o,13129920,13135120,okay uh paul me just stay on with us i  want to cut across to breaking news  that's also coming in right now iknow
pBWp7sZG66o,13135120,13142640,shinde remember had put out a letter in  which he claimed that security has been  removed for him as well as all the other
pBWp7sZG66o,13142640,13149359,rebels the shift cena has now responded  to this maharashtra home minister delay  portal has taken to twitter and said
pBWp7sZG66o,13149359,13155520,that neither the chief minister nor the  home department is ordered that the  protection of any mla be removed the
pBWp7sZG66o,13155520,13162399,allegations made in this regard are  completely wrong and misleading follow  me there'll be a lot of questions about
pBWp7sZG66o,13162399,13168080,why not shinde made this allegation  security's been withdrawn about whether  it's an attempt to buy time so he
pBWp7sZG66o,13168080,13173199,doesn't need to head back to mumbai  right away because the government right  now the home minister coming out of the
pBWp7sZG66o,13173199,13179920,statement saying that security has not  been withdrawn shinde's security remains  intact so does every mla who's which
pBWp7sZG66o,13179920,13182319,shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,13184970,13191120,[Music]  right uh this is of course going to turn  into a battle of words really shinde of
pBWp7sZG66o,13191120,13197040,course has the written and he's made  that letter public as well he's written  uh marking that letter to udhav takre to
pBWp7sZG66o,13197040,13204479,dilip  the minister and to the dgp of  maharashtra as well as all police  commissioners across the state uh he has
pBWp7sZG66o,13204479,13209520,written that letter and he's of course  alleged that all of these attacks that  are happening on the offices the
pBWp7sZG66o,13209520,13217120,vandalism that is happening against  various rebel mlas is happening after  that security has been removed he has of
pBWp7sZG66o,13217120,13223920,course said that uh  will be directly responsible if any harm
pBWp7sZG66o,13223920,13229040,comes to the families of these mlas in  the state of maharashtra they've in fact
pBWp7sZG66o,13229040,13235439,cited uh interviews uh that mr sanjaya  rao has given and has been he's spoken  with the media just yesterday when he's
pBWp7sZG66o,13235439,13240880,basically said that these mlas will find  it difficult to return to maharashtra  and then move around in the state of
pBWp7sZG66o,13240880,13246560,maharashtra saying that this is a threat  which has been in fact given out by  sanjay rao they've also cited the
pBWp7sZG66o,13246560,13252080,example of what happened in punjab just  a couple of months ago when the state  government decided to in fact withdraw
pBWp7sZG66o,13252080,13258479,the security of prominent persons and it  led to uh you know making them  vulnerable to uh gangster attacks as
pBWp7sZG66o,13258479,13265680,well unfortunately leading to the demise  of punjabi singer sidhu musa as well so  that has been cited in the letter as
pBWp7sZG66o,13265680,13271040,well now this is claim versus  counterclaim the shinde camp with those  38 signatures has sent out that letter
pBWp7sZG66o,13271040,13277199,to the cm to the home minister to the  dgp and towards state police  commissioners saying that this has  happened and this is absolutely wrong
pBWp7sZG66o,13277199,13283040,and this is out of a wench vengeance  that this has been done now the  republican party of course are tweeting
pBWp7sZG66o,13283040,13288640,and saying that these allegations are  completely forced it remains to be seen  what happens on the ground itself
pBWp7sZG66o,13288640,13295040,the reality is on the ground the reality  is follow me that there are incidents of  violence being reported so there will be
pBWp7sZG66o,13295040,13300800,questions asked of the senate and of the  government of that as well stay with us  follow me i just want to take our  viewers through the next news break

pBWp7sZG66o,13354000,13360720,breakdown of law and order now  [Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,13360720,13366479,we don't know that what they are going  to what they are doing to stop such  incidents of vandalism and violence but
pBWp7sZG66o,13366479,13372960,let me tell you there has been a some  sort of instigation which has come  continuously happening yesterday when we
pBWp7sZG66o,13372960,13379359,saw that sanjay rao giving a statement  that chief cynics will be on road and  you cannot stop them and today we are
pBWp7sZG66o,13379359,13384640,seeing that how he said that yeah the  chiefs and uh as uh very much angry they
pBWp7sZG66o,13384640,13391920,can be  asking kind of when the violence  incidents can happen but we are stopping  ourselves uh steve sanik uh to stop to
pBWp7sZG66o,13391920,13398720,not do anything of this sort but let me  tell you this is the fourth such  incident where the mla's offices have
pBWp7sZG66o,13398720,13406239,been vandalized by the sunny which is  the utah senate group two offices were  broken uh yesterday uh in kula area and

pBWp7sZG66o,13424800,13429840,their and their family's life is in  danger a security which was provided by
pBWp7sZG66o,13429840,13436479,the government is now taken back home  minister might be saying that the  security is still intact they are right
pBWp7sZG66o,13436479,13442000,now in government we cannot provide them  security in government but here the  security will be provided but let me
pBWp7sZG66o,13442000,13447199,tell you the situation is very grim at  the moment section 144 is implemented in
pBWp7sZG66o,13447199,13453199,thailand city this area comes under  aikna cindy's group nachinde comes from
pBWp7sZG66o,13453199,13458399,tani and the situation right now in tane  the collector the city police of tane
pBWp7sZG66o,13458399,13464960,all have issued prohibited the uh  prohibited orders and section 144 is  imposed when we talk about mumbai the
pBWp7sZG66o,13464960,13471439,mumbai police commissioner already has  taken a high level meeting and has taken  a review of how the security arrangement
pBWp7sZG66o,13471439,13478479,and bondo bus has to be done it will be  very important to see akshita what  happens at the meeting which is going to
pBWp7sZG66o,13478479,13484160,happen in some point of time from now at  the 1 pm uh which is the national uh uh
pBWp7sZG66o,13484160,13489840,national executive meeting of this year  wherein adit attacker will be personally  present and without hakri will be
pBWp7sZG66o,13489840,13497359,present through vc  haas decision a tough decision might be  expected wherein the party leader post
pBWp7sZG66o,13497359,13504399,of aknac shinde and ramdas kadam could  be removed remember the party leader  which this usually called as a neeta is
pBWp7sZG66o,13504399,13511681,a very important term only four nethers  are right now in china which also  includes
pBWp7sZG66o,13513040,13519920,so their post might be removed as a  party leader which will give a very  strong statement to the rebel camp so
pBWp7sZG66o,13519920,13526160,continuously some of the other things  are happening meanwhile a meeting is  going on at the sagar bangalore at the
pBWp7sZG66o,13526160,13532640,bjp but even the fernan is meeting  several uh mlas and the independent mls  as well so we are seeing a lot of
pBWp7sZG66o,13532640,13537680,developments continuously happening but  the  1 pm meeting of shivsena's national
pBWp7sZG66o,13537680,13543359,executive meeting at ascendable will be  very important back to yakshita very  true but what we're playing out right
pBWp7sZG66o,13543359,13549600,now on our screens and we hope udoptery  will come out to condemn this is shifts  thenx now going ahead and taking law
pBWp7sZG66o,13549600,13555520,into their own hands this is an internal  fight within the shiv seda and the  emotional shift settings are now
pBWp7sZG66o,13555520,13562479,targeting vandalizing property this is a  rebel mla's office in pune that's been  targeted and unfortunately multiple such
pBWp7sZG66o,13562479,13568239,incidents that have been reported  perhaps also what we've seen syrup is  that these kind of incidents have
pBWp7sZG66o,13568239,13574000,increased after the likes of even uddaf  thakuray sanjay rao said we will win  this battle on the streets that's a
pBWp7sZG66o,13574000,13581880,clear message to ship sanix so known  always to go on this kind of a rampage  at the drop of a hat
pBWp7sZG66o,13583439,13588479,so that they are going to play uh the  this game till this last ball so what
pBWp7sZG66o,13588479,13594640,they are right now are trying to say  like we saw the statement of sanjay  routh earlier he said that let them come
pBWp7sZG66o,13594640,13600160,to mumbai let them have the flow test  all the mlas who are back in the gowat
pBWp7sZG66o,13600160,13605760,hotel half of them are going to  going to vote in our favor that is what
pBWp7sZG66o,13605760,13612160,sanjay routh is claiming but it doesn't  seem on ground that that will happen  because eight nights in this group is
pBWp7sZG66o,13612160,13618880,very firm at the moment whatever  statements are given by ut  by sanjay rao they are giving back them
pBWp7sZG66o,13618880,13627199,the answer at the moment uh we are  seeing a moment over here there is a  minister who has just arrived at udot
pBWp7sZG66o,13627199,13633040,resident and will try to know who is he  uh but let me tell you that just some
pBWp7sZG66o,13633040,13639199,time from now  aditya takari is going to leave  from matoshi a very important meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,13639199,13645359,like you said  but coming back to the security  arrangement and the security issues at
pBWp7sZG66o,13645359,13650640,the moment uh the police has  is reviewing the particular situation we
pBWp7sZG66o,13650640,13658000,are also been told that tane city  remains very sensitive at the moment  apart from prohibited and section 144
pBWp7sZG66o,13658000,13665840,which is imposed in the thani city we  are here hearing that the rebel group  suffered are going to protest a huge
pBWp7sZG66o,13665840,13672080,march in outside iknow cinder house so  law and order situation still remains a
pBWp7sZG66o,13672080,13677520,concern for city of tane and mumbai as  well
pBWp7sZG66o,13677520,13684479,very true and we're seeing several such  incidents being reported this is one  incident in pune where shifts and eggs
pBWp7sZG66o,13684479,13689680,going on a rampage have vandalized that  particular rebel mla's office
pBWp7sZG66o,13689680,13697120,you see how many of them scores of them  with the ships in a flag barging into  the office destroying property raising
pBWp7sZG66o,13697120,13702960,slogans and remember that even in places  like thani which is not sunday  stronghold there have been multiple
pBWp7sZG66o,13702960,13708601,incidents of violence take a look at  exactly what's playing out there in pune
pBWp7sZG66o,13708930,13714720,[Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,13714720,13720329,foreign  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,13725600,13730960,yes  [Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,13730960,13734050,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,13740239,13747489,ah  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,13756080,13761680,this is the kind of uh angle that shifts  cynics are showing now on the streets no
pBWp7sZG66o,13761680,13768720,action being taken against them they're  being allowed  blatantly to go on this rampage because  this is what the shiv cena wants right
pBWp7sZG66o,13768720,13774880,now saurabh to flex muscle to show off  their strength on the streets and is the  common man who pays because this is a
pBWp7sZG66o,13774880,13782080,clear breakdown of law and order  [Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,13782080,13787359,well  you really don't know what will what is  going to happen because
pBWp7sZG66o,13787359,13792960,known for such aggression for last  couple of days we are seeing that
pBWp7sZG66o,13792960,13798000,are giving out emotional speeches they  are trying to connect from uh ground to
pBWp7sZG66o,13798000,13803279,upper cattle of the party and giving out  so many emotional speeches but now it's
pBWp7sZG66o,13803279,13808319,the second part of the sushina which is  the aggression the aggressive susanna
pBWp7sZG66o,13808319,13815520,who is known to vandalize public  properties who are known to go out in  the open and uh and hit
pBWp7sZG66o,13815520,13823199,an assault and for writings we are known  for shushing up for writing as well so  now this is being shown as a message
pBWp7sZG66o,13823199,13830640,clearly a message has been indicated to  the rebel groups this is particular  strategy in a way akshita that we are
pBWp7sZG66o,13830640,13837279,the real shusanic and a threatening  message the first threatening message  was given out for the disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,13837279,13842560,of the 6 16 mlas now this is a threat  that how we can vandalize your offices
pBWp7sZG66o,13842560,13849120,and your places so therefore ekna shinde  group is now been targeted uh like taken
pBWp7sZG66o,13849120,13855040,morale can  can be down and so many things should go  down so what strategy right now
pBWp7sZG66o,13855040,13862080,uthausena is doing is trying to take  time time buying process also that  sitting at that particular hotel in
pBWp7sZG66o,13862080,13869120,goatee they keep on thinking so many  phone calls have been happening from  matoshi to goatee hotel to some of the
pBWp7sZG66o,13869120,13875040,mls that they should come back that you  will be respected in a way which earlier  you were respected so you should come
pBWp7sZG66o,13875040,13882399,back you should not leave the khakri  family the real shiv cena and not join  such a cheap politics so a lot of things
pBWp7sZG66o,13882399,13888880,are right now happening uh it will be  very important to see uh that what  decisions right now are being taken both
pBWp7sZG66o,13888880,13895279,by the uddhausena and  shinde sena because what we have been  told at 1 pm the meeting of national
pBWp7sZG66o,13895279,13900479,executive which has been going to happen  at cena bhavan there is also  simultaneous meeting which is going to
pBWp7sZG66o,13900479,13906000,happen at guwahati hotel what aka group  saturday right now will be that the
pBWp7sZG66o,13906000,13911199,disqualification of 16 amulet does not  happen akshita because if that happens
pBWp7sZG66o,13911199,13917920,it is going to take a very long process  then it will be a legal battle inside  the court which is going to take a long
pBWp7sZG66o,13917920,13925199,time and the floor test might not happen  this  in the group does not want they cannot  sit a whole month at that particular
pBWp7sZG66o,13925199,13931920,goatee hotel because they are thinking  about the flow test at the moment  sushena doesn't want the flow test to
pBWp7sZG66o,13931920,13938479,happen very soon because they want to  take some time they want to try to  convince the rebel mlas over the world
pBWp7sZG66o,13938479,13945439,and take them to their side so it is  going to be very interesting couple of  days will be very important to see and
pBWp7sZG66o,13945439,13951920,what outcome comes from the meeting of  uttawa sina and shinde cena will be very  important to check
pBWp7sZG66o,13951920,13957840,very true and uh let's hope there's a  condemnation also that comes in from  mudaptery on what we're seeing right now
pBWp7sZG66o,13957840,13964560,this kind of violence that's playing out  in the straits of maharashtra the  reality also is that iknow shinde has
pBWp7sZG66o,13964560,13970560,referred to this in the letter that we  spoke about just a few moments ago uh  that's got the signature of 38 ships
pBWp7sZG66o,13970560,13977120,inaudible he's referred to incidents  like this of rebel mla's offices of  their properties being targeted across
pBWp7sZG66o,13977120,13984239,maharashtra and unfortunately this isn't  the only incident that's been reported  in the last 24 hours shinde has referred
pBWp7sZG66o,13984239,13990319,to this to say that security has been  withdrawn for me as well as all of the  other mlas who've chosen to side with me
pBWp7sZG66o,13990319,13995600,a claim that's been dismissed by the  maharashtra government with the  maharashtra home minister also saying
pBWp7sZG66o,13995600,14001920,that there's no such order that's been  passed security is still being provided  to all of these mlas but then the
pBWp7sZG66o,14001920,14009120,government will also have to walk the  talk here it's a different matter that  this is an internal fight of the shiv  cena but quite an other when it plays
pBWp7sZG66o,14009120,14015279,out and spills out on the streets of  maharashtra leading to a complete  breakdown of law and order something
pBWp7sZG66o,14015279,14021279,unfortunately that the shift settings  are known for for resorting to this kind  of a rampage taking law into their hands
pBWp7sZG66o,14021279,14030760,and facing zero action  [Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,14032720,14035840,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,14038080,14045040,and let's in fact also play out for you  what sanjay rauth has said particularly  when he is issued a death you're seeing
pBWp7sZG66o,14045040,14051760,at this point the udav senator getting  more aggressive with the legal steps now  being taken they believe that things
pBWp7sZG66o,14051760,14056960,could still work out in their advantage  sanjay routh in fact while this
pBWp7sZG66o,14056960,14062239,political drama was happening also said  yesterday that the fight is over numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,14062239,14067359,it's on papers and on the streets and  that cena would win all three at a time
pBWp7sZG66o,14067359,14074399,when things are so sensitive on the  ground ralph made this comment udav  takari also followed it uh and said that
pBWp7sZG66o,14074399,14080640,you know we will ensure that we win this  fight on the straights all of this has  perhaps triggered shifts annex to go out
pBWp7sZG66o,14080640,14085239,on the streets and resort to this kind  of a rampage
pBWp7sZG66o,14098479,14101479,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,14110880,14118399,so that was the comment that was made by  sanjay raot yesterday you also had uttav  takri making a similar comment and uh in
pBWp7sZG66o,14118399,14124160,tani for example where which is not  shinde stronghold they've been  prohibited orders that have been imposed
pBWp7sZG66o,14124160,14130080,to ensure that there's no breakdown of  law and order what about other parts of  maharashtra like in pune where there's
pBWp7sZG66o,14130080,14135359,been a vandalism spree that's been  reported so even as the political  updates are coming in and flying in
pBWp7sZG66o,14135359,14141520,thick and fast the unfortunate reality  is that now it's built onto the streets  of maharashtra as well and these shift
pBWp7sZG66o,14141520,14148560,centrics known very often having this  reputation of taking law into their  hands are doing exactly that once again
pBWp7sZG66o,14148560,14154000,i'm slipping into a short break here on  india today stay with us as we continue  our non-stop coverage of all that's

pBWp7sZG66o,14180319,14185359,i bought a toothpaste and a marmite and  i saw it finish
pBWp7sZG66o,14185359,14193960,and then i went to the shop to buy again  and i was like i haven't seen a  toothpaste finish  for the last 15 years
pBWp7sZG66o,14198960,14204239,i'm not i've not gone away uh because of  corvid i did i just moved and i loved
pBWp7sZG66o,14204239,14211760,those two years away you know when i  first went there i bought a toothpaste  and a marmite and i saw it
pBWp7sZG66o,14211760,14218239,and then i went to the shop to buy again  and i was like i haven't seen a  toothpaste finish  for the last 15 years
pBWp7sZG66o,14218239,14223680,because i've been traveling so much i  have some four or six sets of things  right one in london one in london to
pBWp7sZG66o,14223680,14228960,travel one always with an airport bag  one i've never seen a  thing finished
pBWp7sZG66o,14228960,14234399,i loved it so i think i want to see it  again wait like i want to have a bit of  a stability
pBWp7sZG66o,14234399,14241199,yeah man so  just reading watching  uh eating in the sense not food
pBWp7sZG66o,14241199,14246880,it in order to give like being able to  give you know what i mean so i'm  enjoying that
pBWp7sZG66o,14246880,14252080,and uh i'm slowly coming back  they say you have two four
pBWp7sZG66o,14252080,14258160,four  releases um but  slowly let's see
pBWp7sZG66o,14258960,14265120,the thing is the truth is last two years  most of the things have been on other  like whether they're films or cvs you
pBWp7sZG66o,14265120,14271439,know what i mean  so i don't know um but do you think it's  better than what's been written in
pBWp7sZG66o,14271439,14277199,cinema rules written especially for  women that's what i'm saying i don't  know because jalsa
pBWp7sZG66o,14277199,14283120,was great it's a film uh then gangubai  the part was great
pBWp7sZG66o,14283120,14289600,then  you know deepika's just uh done nagera  here which was written for a woman
pBWp7sZG66o,14289600,14295680,uh  then and they have  many films which were also quite strong
pBWp7sZG66o,14295680,14301600,parts uh forensic was also  a strong woman character
pBWp7sZG66o,14301600,14308239,so i think it's more or less the same  which i'm aware of on twitter though i
pBWp7sZG66o,14308239,14314399,don't actively participate in  i'm aware of the fact that there there  is a debate online about you know why
pBWp7sZG66o,14314399,14320880,should we you know remake films that  have already been made  uh  maybe it's just a phase right now
pBWp7sZG66o,14320880,14326160,but it's it's also very cyclical  and creatively speaking as she said
pBWp7sZG66o,14326160,14333040,in our film especially strictly speaking  about our film  it's a very different perspective

pBWp7sZG66o,15517439,15525120,huge story huge story  sanjay route telling india today's mos  me is saying
pBWp7sZG66o,15525760,15531279,will not resign  since yesterday in fact for the past  several days there has been intense
pBWp7sZG66o,15531279,15538560,speculation that after the national  executive  buddha  may resign but sanjay rao makes it very
pBWp7sZG66o,15538560,15544640,clear he's extremely combative in fact  it could almost be argued or the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,15544640,15549760,camp could argue that this is a threat  that is being issued a threat that
pBWp7sZG66o,15549760,15556080,shifts saying up is fire this is the  anger of shiv senex on the streets and
pBWp7sZG66o,15556080,15561680,that it is spilling out and if this fire  spreads this fire cannot be contained
pBWp7sZG66o,15561680,15569199,that's a huge point being made by ship  saying a member of parliament sanjay  route someone who's considered as the
pBWp7sZG66o,15569199,15575760,hand man of uttar takre another very  important point being made here by  sanjay route to india today's mosby
pBWp7sZG66o,15575760,15582560,singh was  utthaft  is emotionally a broken man uttha
pBWp7sZG66o,15582560,15589199,thakrei had placed his trust he was  unwell and those he trusted stabbed him
pBWp7sZG66o,15589199,15597680,in the back that's the narrative but  somewhere down the line is there also a  realization that those rebel mps
pBWp7sZG66o,15597680,15605279,their numbers maybe 38 plus 10  independence 39 plus nine independence
pBWp7sZG66o,15605279,15610880,well are they not coming back now india  today is mossmi singh who did that india
pBWp7sZG66o,15610880,15616319,today exclusive now joins me on the  broadcast most me that's a big point  being made by sanjay rauth and some
pBWp7sZG66o,15616319,15622159,could say it's almost a threat that's  going out to the rebels but he's very  clear that buddha
pBWp7sZG66o,15622159,15627841,is not resigning he's not resigning  after the national executive
pBWp7sZG66o,15630080,15636880,uh god of joining me exclusively on  india today is sanjay rauth and we'll  take take this entire
pBWp7sZG66o,15636880,15642000,matter to him because sanjay raot has  made  certain statements uh sir you have
pBWp7sZG66o,15642000,15647520,issued in fact a threat uh to many of  the mla saying mumbai autobata
pBWp7sZG66o,15647520,15653640,and then we see that tanaji sarwan's uh  office is vandalized

pBWp7sZG66o,15870000,15875840,chip sena workers on the streets  mosby very clearly shifts in our workers
pBWp7sZG66o,15875840,15881840,are taken to the streets um office of uh  tanaji's seventh has been vandalized  and
pBWp7sZG66o,15881840,15885279,sanjay route actually says

pBWp7sZG66o,15892800,15899520,is this a very  actually a not so subtle message that's  going out to rebels unless you fall in

pBWp7sZG66o,15929439,15936460,now  a civil war that's spilling out on the  streets of maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,15936460,15943359,[Music]  i'll get you the highlights of what  sanjay rauth has told india today just a
pBWp7sZG66o,15943359,15949279,short while back sanjay rao says  this is the anger of the people
pBWp7sZG66o,15949279,15957279,of shiv cena  it cannot be stopped  a message  that is going out to the rebel mlas that
pBWp7sZG66o,15957279,15964248,is the shift signings who made you  and they are very angry  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,15964319,15971199,these are the words that are being used  by  sanjay routh at this stage and i quickly  want to cut across to india today
pBWp7sZG66o,15971199,15976800,saurabh bhaktanya joining us live from  matoshri and this is where
pBWp7sZG66o,15976800,15982000,mata shri is the epicenter of all the  action as far as the shift cena or the
pBWp7sZG66o,15982000,15987600,uddhav sena is concerned at this point  of time and  is this then a sign of times to come
pBWp7sZG66o,15987600,15995760,saurabh  either fall in line or the anger of the  ships and eggs will engulf maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,15997040,16004479,[Applause]  well gowda the messages message is very  clear we knew that shivsena is it is an
pBWp7sZG66o,16004479,16011040,emotional party as well as an aggressive  party the emotional messages for the  last couple of days are over and now we
pBWp7sZG66o,16011040,16017120,are seeing the reaction the reaction is  that how they are going on and  vandalizing the offices of the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,16017120,16024560,camp first we saw the two offices which  were broken in kurla then the poster and  banners were uh were completely taken
pBWp7sZG66o,16024560,16029840,off and now the office of tanaji savant  in pune is completely vandalized now
pBWp7sZG66o,16029840,16035920,when we spoke to the cynics gaurav who  actually vandalized this whole office of  tana ji saw and what they said is very
pBWp7sZG66o,16035920,16042720,interesting they are saying that this is  the reaction and this is just the  beginning  none of the mlas of the rebel camp will
pBWp7sZG66o,16042720,16049359,be able to walk freely on the roads of  maharashtra if they want to bring in  security they should bring in security
pBWp7sZG66o,16049359,16056000,from the central forces or not from  maharashtra this is maharashtra and this  is the place of susana and civic so it
pBWp7sZG66o,16056000,16064479,is going to be a lot of law and order  situation in maharashtra  and a clear threat to the rebel camp

pBWp7sZG66o,16257520,16264080,they're still trying to verify whether  this was violence by shifts anniks or  whether this was violence by

pBWp7sZG66o,16425199,16431920,especially when there's an apprehension  this could spread uh across maharashtra  but explain this to me
pBWp7sZG66o,16431920,16437119,is uttaphtha crave you know there was  some information that came in that  seemed to indicate that the ncp has
pBWp7sZG66o,16437119,16442561,advised uttar thakura to put in his  papers ncp has advised him he doesn't  have the numbers don't go for a floor
pBWp7sZG66o,16442561,16449359,test it could be more embarrassing for  the mahavikas agardi but sanjay routh  makes it very clear there is no question
pBWp7sZG66o,16449359,16454561,of uttaph takri resigning is is there a  change in thought or is this actually
pBWp7sZG66o,16454561,16457520,what's happening on ground
pBWp7sZG66o,16459840,16466000,well there it does not seem to be a  change at all gaurav in fact uh you know  the uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,16466000,16471439,faction is extremely adamant that they  will not agree to what uh the uh you
pBWp7sZG66o,16471439,16478639,know the other shifts in gohani have  been saying the eighth not shinde uh  camp is actually asking them to break
pBWp7sZG66o,16478639,16484400,away from the congress and the ncp and  to take on the mantle with the bjp
pBWp7sZG66o,16484400,16490639,remain in the government but with a  like-minded party is what they are  seeking but right here we have been
pBWp7sZG66o,16490639,16495760,hearing you know be it uh sanjay rao  beat any of these but in fact the lowest
pBWp7sZG66o,16495760,16501359,ranked bj you know shivsanics are who  are all here right now from jillah
pBWp7sZG66o,16501359,16507279,you know shakha promotes all of them  seem to be of the  opinion that what thak rays are saying
pBWp7sZG66o,16507279,16513680,is right that they should the nba  government should really go ahead it is  a decision of the tacrist that they
pBWp7sZG66o,16513680,16519520,agree with in spite of me asking them  various times you know that your entire  core
pBWp7sZG66o,16519520,16525039,entire ideology the core ideology of  hindu is matches that of the bjp so why
pBWp7sZG66o,16525039,16531119,not said once the thakris have taken a  decision to go with a certain party we  stick to it is what the sheer signings
pBWp7sZG66o,16531119,16536719,right here at the ground have been  saying and that's probably what is  reflective in the idea in the entire
pBWp7sZG66o,16536719,16543680,decisions that are being made at the  shiv sinha bhavan right now as well  since yesterday we have been seeing
pBWp7sZG66o,16543680,16550879,every decision that has been conveyed be  it with regards to aditya takre be it  with regards to uttar takri sanjaya all
pBWp7sZG66o,16550879,16558000,of them have been saying that those  rebel mlas have to come here speak to us  and then we'll decide but until then
pBWp7sZG66o,16558000,16564000,everything goes on as it is right now  and that's the reason we do see  yesterday also we had seen shahrukh
pBWp7sZG66o,16564000,16571119,power go and visit  his residence so certainly until then  the entire mba will be together is what
pBWp7sZG66o,16571119,16576719,the thakras and everyone has been  stating so in about 20 minutes from now  the national executive meet of the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,16576719,16583840,cena will start and vidya's reporting  from ground zero i will come to her for  more on the story but this
pBWp7sZG66o,16583840,16590000,is cena war that's spilling out on the  streets  it's happened already in pune in one
pBWp7sZG66o,16590000,16595920,place there are reports in sangli in  kolapur in other parts of maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,16595920,16604000,and is there an apprehension that this  will only escalate i spoke to the rebel  mla deepak kisarkar and he's
pBWp7sZG66o,16604000,16611840,appealed for peace and he says these  intimidation tactics should not be  adopted they will not work
pBWp7sZG66o,16612799,16617920,the shift cena may be advised to throw  in the tal but they continue to fight
pBWp7sZG66o,16617920,16624400,sanjay rao has made it very clear the  time for talks is over shifts and ex are  now on the streets and this fight will
pBWp7sZG66o,16624400,16630000,happen not just on the floor of the  house but also on the streets sir
pBWp7sZG66o,16630080,16637760,being the constitutional head of the  state it is honorable cm's  responsibility to see that law and order
pBWp7sZG66o,16637760,16643359,is maintained in maharashtra and he is  solely responsible for this and i think
pBWp7sZG66o,16643359,16648719,uddasab is a very strict administrator  and as a cm of maharashtra he will
pBWp7sZG66o,16648719,16655600,control what is going on on the streets  and he will advise i will also request  him to advise uh
pBWp7sZG66o,16655600,16662080,sanjay raoji to now not to make such  comments had such comment made by any uh
pBWp7sZG66o,16662080,16667199,opposition party by this time police  could have taken action against them but
pBWp7sZG66o,16667199,16672959,since he is a representative of uh the  ruling party i think those should tell
pBWp7sZG66o,16672959,16678480,him not to make such uh statements by  which violence has
pBWp7sZG66o,16678480,16684959,erupted in uh mumbai and mumbai is a  financial capital of india okay mumbai's
pBWp7sZG66o,16684959,16690959,progress should not be hampered in any  case and that is the duty of honorable  cm
pBWp7sZG66o,16690959,16697199,what is the writing on the wall because  sanjay routh makes it very clear shift  cena and shift cynics is all about
pBWp7sZG66o,16697199,16703760,akrosh anger and fire will we see this  actually happen on the streets not just
pBWp7sZG66o,16703760,16710000,of mumbai but across maharashtra we'll  track that story very closely up next  uddhaftakray calls for a meeting of the
pBWp7sZG66o,16710000,16715039,national executive of the ship sena  there's also a crackdown on ignacion day

pBWp7sZG66o,16765039,16772561,block 1 the basic version of the space  launch system is nasa's heavy launcher  at its top is the orion spacecraft orion
pBWp7sZG66o,16772561,16779040,goes into orbit around the earth it is  the immediate cryogenic propulsion stage  that will give orion the big thrust
pBWp7sZG66o,16779040,16784958,needed to leave the earth's orbit and  head for the moon to navigate in space  orion will be powered by a service
pBWp7sZG66o,16784958,16790160,module that also generates air and water  for astronauts on future missions
pBWp7sZG66o,16790160,16795680,orion will approach around 100  kilometers from the moon and will take  advantage of its gravitational force to
pBWp7sZG66o,16795680,16801440,reach a distant orbit at about 70 000  kilometers from the moon between 6 to 19
pBWp7sZG66o,16801440,16806638,days  once orion's performance has been  analyzed the module will head back to
pBWp7sZG66o,16806638,16813040,earth taking advantage of the moon's  gravitational pull nasa will conduct  scientific experiments in deep space
pBWp7sZG66o,16813040,16818320,with several nanosatellites deployed  during this mission  if the results of this mission are
pBWp7sZG66o,16818320,16824560,validated it will be followed by the  artemis 2 mission which will carry four  astronauts around the moon on board the

pBWp7sZG66o,16998798,17006798,welcome back is the countdown to the  shifts in our national executive meet  that will take place at 1pm in about 15
pBWp7sZG66o,17006798,17013360,minutes from now  information that's coming in indicates  that
pBWp7sZG66o,17013360,17019600,his  faction of the shiv cena or at least the  mla is with him and the party rank and
pBWp7sZG66o,17019600,17026400,file they are very clear they want hard  action against the rebel shinde cena
pBWp7sZG66o,17026400,17032638,not just against iknow shinde but also  against other other mlas and those who
pBWp7sZG66o,17032638,17038798,may remain in maharashtra but are loyal  to the iknow shinde sena we are also
pBWp7sZG66o,17038798,17044240,being told that senior shifa  ramdas kadam
pBWp7sZG66o,17044240,17050798,may be axed uddhav  is all set to hold that national  executive sources are telling india
pBWp7sZG66o,17050798,17057520,today uttar thakur is likely to remove  iknot shinde as the party leader sources
pBWp7sZG66o,17057520,17062878,also say uddhav is expected to discuss  action against all other
pBWp7sZG66o,17062878,17069680,rebel mlas who are in  gohati  india today is mustafa sheikh now joins
pBWp7sZG66o,17069680,17076878,me for more on the story mustafa  we were told that uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,17076878,17083120,uh was emotionally broken but he's being  advised and not just by sharat pawar of
pBWp7sZG66o,17083120,17089520,the ncp he is being advised to take a  hard line on the rebels and supporters
pBWp7sZG66o,17089520,17093440,of rebels what more can you tell
pBWp7sZG66o,17094840,17100480,us well yes gaurav it's not only the  mahabharata government of utaka which is
pBWp7sZG66o,17100480,17106718,under crisis but the ships and the party  itself it's almost broken apart and  hence urdu
pBWp7sZG66o,17106718,17111840,has to you know activate the ships and x  at ward levels and also save his
pBWp7sZG66o,17111840,17119120,government so it he is in a action mode  if you can see since yesterday  has had many public meetings yesterday
pBWp7sZG66o,17119120,17125760,twice he and aditya thakura had  addressed this shift  and now the national executive meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,17125760,17132080,in which some harsh decisions are  expected to be taken against those shift  centers for example who are in the
pBWp7sZG66o,17132080,17138160,working committee and whose dear and  near ones have left for guwahati for  example ram das katam he is in the
pBWp7sZG66o,17138160,17144718,working committee his son shivsana mla  yogesh kadam is in kuwaiti with the  iknacks in the camp he is likely to be
pBWp7sZG66o,17144718,17150480,expelled from the working community so  many such decisions are to be taken  there are we are hearing sabbah which
pBWp7sZG66o,17150480,17157200,attitude is going to address in mumbai  at various parts and also  the ransacking of offices and homes of
pBWp7sZG66o,17157200,17163920,mlas who have left be it in mumbai pete  in pune so the shiv sana is in action  mode they don't know what will happen
pBWp7sZG66o,17163920,17169840,next whether the animal is if  disqualified will move to court whether  the deputy speaker will be caught in for
pBWp7sZG66o,17169840,17174878,a no trust support and there will be no  speaker in the massacre so these are  things on uh
pBWp7sZG66o,17174878,17180718,which he is facing as a challenge and  he's trying to tackle it one by one  we'll have to wait and see what the ekna
pBWp7sZG66o,17180718,17187840,cinder camp does that will be very  crucial we are hearing they are going to  address a press conference whether they  come back to mumbai whether they stake
pBWp7sZG66o,17187840,17194876,claim to form the government or say that  the government is minority everything is  now restrictive on that
pBWp7sZG66o,17195440,17201120,all right but is ramdas kadam actually  being punished for his son yogesh
pBWp7sZG66o,17201120,17206718,kadam's actions because yogesh kadam is  one of the rebels whether it's the
pBWp7sZG66o,17206718,17214716,number is 38 or 39 there's no clarity  just as yet uh is is ramdas kadam being  punished for his son's actions
pBWp7sZG66o,17216560,17222320,well ramdas kadam has been sidelined the  shift cena long ago there was some  controversy which had erupted and his
pBWp7sZG66o,17222320,17228240,phone call was recorded by one of the  eminence workers in which he was happy  because anil para who's close head of
pBWp7sZG66o,17228240,17234560,uttar takri action was taken against  anil paragh bungalow in dapoli in the  area of maharashtra so there was some
pBWp7sZG66o,17234560,17241120,allegation against him that he was  trying to you know after being sidelined  after 2019 he was you know trying to get
pBWp7sZG66o,17241120,17246718,back his position and trying to target  people who are close to the targets that  was one thing his son remained in
pBWp7sZG66o,17246718,17252718,sub-saharan but now as he has gone to  kuwaiti then there is more spotlight on  random his action and his loyalty
pBWp7sZG66o,17252718,17259280,towards ships and are back to you  okay stay with me i also want to cut  across to vidya uh joining us from the
pBWp7sZG66o,17259280,17266320,shift cena  for more on the stories with them  on what lines is the shift center now
pBWp7sZG66o,17266320,17273040,moving forward because you've been  speaking to a cross-section of leaders  right from the top down to the zilla
pBWp7sZG66o,17273040,17279840,pramooks and the shaka pramooks what  direction is the shift cena moving in  now
pBWp7sZG66o,17281520,17287040,well the direction really remains the  same that has been chosen in the last  couple of days which basically means
pBWp7sZG66o,17287040,17292240,that all those who have rebelled will  not be really  you know persuaded by emotions any
pBWp7sZG66o,17292240,17298878,further if they really want to return  they will or else they will also try the  chefs and ex here in mumbai we'll also
pBWp7sZG66o,17298878,17304320,try to see to it that there is a  pressure that is built up to make sure  that those those pleadings that we had
pBWp7sZG66o,17304320,17309520,seen on the first day that does not  happen any further that's one thing
pBWp7sZG66o,17309520,17316638,which is very clear the sheriff's annex  have decided that they will try to put a  pressure on uh you know these people
pBWp7sZG66o,17316638,17322798,right here a lot of people are still  going inside a lot of these political  leaders are still going on inside for
pBWp7sZG66o,17322798,17329040,the executive meet uh most of the senior  leaders like sanjay rauth
pBWp7sZG66o,17329040,17335798,all these people have actually reached  here  sir can i can i
pBWp7sZG66o,17344560,17350718,most of the political leaders going  inside are actually refusing to speak  as to what will be decided but there one
pBWp7sZG66o,17350718,17356080,thing that is clear is that whatever ut  has decided will be the way that will be
pBWp7sZG66o,17356080,17361840,shown to the people the executive meet  will decide the you know the next couple
pBWp7sZG66o,17361840,17367200,of days as to what more they can do to  pressurize the mlas to come back up
pBWp7sZG66o,17367200,17373200,that's among one of the decisions of  course and apart from that the the ways  that the pressure can really be put
pBWp7sZG66o,17373200,17380320,built up last yesterday we have seen how  you know the the shift signings on the  ground have gone and uh uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,17380320,17386638,beat the posters beat the officers of  the ship senate leaders uh the mlas who  have gone they have been ransacked so
pBWp7sZG66o,17386638,17393600,all that is being done apart from that  more more legal issues that can be  picked up so all these things are going
pBWp7sZG66o,17393600,17400240,to be discussed right here  okay an effort to keep the shift senate
pBWp7sZG66o,17400240,17406080,together because the threat is that  iknow has so far succeeded in taking
pBWp7sZG66o,17406080,17411360,control of two thirds at least that's  what is the claim of the rebel cena  they've succeeded in taking control of
pBWp7sZG66o,17411360,17417280,two thirds of the mlas  do they also have it to split the party
pBWp7sZG66o,17417280,17422638,right down the center that is the  biggest threat that uttaf thakura faces  at this point of time and the question
pBWp7sZG66o,17422638,17428240,remains  in this ongoing tussle between uddhaf  thakura and uddhav sena on one side and
pBWp7sZG66o,17428240,17436560,iknak shinde and  the rebel cena on the other side which  is  the real shiv cena
pBWp7sZG66o,17439520,17446960,which is the real shift cena  who will inherit balashab takrez legacy
pBWp7sZG66o,17446960,17453120,[Music]  and who will rule maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,17455280,17460400,this raging political mahabharata has  now entered a legal battleground both
pBWp7sZG66o,17460400,17467280,chief minister udav takrei and rebel  eknat shinde  are staking claim as the rightful heir
pBWp7sZG66o,17467280,17470520,of shift
pBWp7sZG66o,17485040,17488040,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,17493120,17498560,one thing is clear a split in shift sena  is now inevitable
pBWp7sZG66o,17498560,17506638,shinde and 37 mlas have broken rank from  the uddhav sena they are now the  majority leaving the original shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,17506638,17511680,to be reduced to a minority party  and now
pBWp7sZG66o,17511680,17517122,shinde sena is moving in for the kill by  laying
pBWp7sZG66o,17533740,17536878,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,17542400,17545638,are synonyms
pBWp7sZG66o,17550400,17553400,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,17567840,17575200,the matter can be only decided by the  election commission  election commission will also decide on
pBWp7sZG66o,17575200,17580638,allotment of party symbol on set rules  if ekna shinde seeks official
pBWp7sZG66o,17580638,17586320,recognition  till then the war of words war for
pBWp7sZG66o,17586320,17594158,legacy and the war for power will only  get bigger bureau report india today
pBWp7sZG66o,17594718,17601360,and the senate versus sena war is only  intensifying and it's happening at  multiple levels it is now being fought
pBWp7sZG66o,17601360,17607120,in the mind space with the rebel cena  still in gohati and uddhav shiv sena in
pBWp7sZG66o,17607120,17614318,maharashtra it's spilling out on the  streets already remember  one faction says
pBWp7sZG66o,17623280,17628480,we also believe in the ideology of  ballast  now we are told that there is a show of

pBWp7sZG66o,19317520,19322878,of the rebel mlas he said it needs to be  verified who actually carried out uh the
pBWp7sZG66o,19322878,19328400,this process of vandalizing officers  because officers were being vandalized
pBWp7sZG66o,19328400,19333920,by those who were also uh waving the  flag of the ncp this is the allegation

pBWp7sZG66o,19394320,19400558,chief minister uttar thakura is also  ready because this was not planned out  this is this is going to be big because
pBWp7sZG66o,19400558,19405920,earlier it was not planned that chief  minister without hakri might be going to  cena but right now here in the visuals
pBWp7sZG66o,19405920,19412400,you can clearly see the convoys are  already ready and we may see a moment in  some time but when we speak about the
pBWp7sZG66o,19412400,19418160,law and order situation there is a high  level meeting which is going on of the  mumbai police commissioner sanjay pandey
pBWp7sZG66o,19418160,19424240,who is taking stock of the whole  situation in city of tani which is the  stronghold of iknow

pBWp7sZG66o,19437120,19442320,that msd section 144 there is a huge  gathering of the eight not shinde group
pBWp7sZG66o,19442320,19448718,at his resident in thane so this will be  very important that how the huge
pBWp7sZG66o,19448718,19453920,gathering might take place in city of  tane amid section 144 and once again you
pBWp7sZG66o,19453920,19459840,can see here how the moment is happening  aditya hakri has already left for cena
pBWp7sZG66o,19459840,19465200,bhavan he has reached  several other ministers and vips have
pBWp7sZG66o,19465200,19472638,already reached  so what message will be given at cena  bhavan what will be message to the whole

pBWp7sZG66o,19479600,19485840,what speech chief minister udav thakri  and richard hagrid delivers at this  particular meeting will be very
pBWp7sZG66o,19485840,19493120,important to see so very  important meeting which is going to  happen just from and sometime right now
pBWp7sZG66o,19493120,19499440,and uh this was not expected actually  god because we've been told that chief  minister might be attending the senate
pBWp7sZG66o,19499440,19506480,meeting through vc rita takri will be  going but right now here we can see that  the convoy is already ready and if
pBWp7sZG66o,19506480,19512080,without hakri  gives an address a speech at this  particular cena it will be very
pBWp7sZG66o,19512080,19517680,important to see what will be the next  line of action of ut
pBWp7sZG66o,19517680,19524480,stay with me stay with me sarah because  this becomes extremely interesting on  the road ahead and i want to bring in
pBWp7sZG66o,19524480,19529680,india today's mos me sing for more on  this big story mosmi you got us that
pBWp7sZG66o,19529680,19536080,scoop uh speaking to sanjay rauth that  uttaf thakrei will not resign and
pBWp7sZG66o,19536080,19543120,this indicates that the shift cena is  extremely combative at this stage  against the advice of the mahavika
pBWp7sZG66o,19543120,19549040,sagari partners including ncp must be  the what was being said asking uddhav to
pBWp7sZG66o,19549040,19554556,throw in the tal to put in his papers  because they didn't have the numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,19558320,19565280,see gaurav one thing that the shift  center and perhaps the alliance partners  have done right from the start he
pBWp7sZG66o,19565280,19570798,despite all the conspiracy theories  being floated despite the rebel mps
pBWp7sZG66o,19570798,19576878,blaming the ncp and the congress and in  turn leading to a rift uh the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,19576878,19584080,senate the uddhav sena in fact has  ensured that there are there is no  misunderstanding between the allied
pBWp7sZG66o,19584080,19588796,partners and that's one reason that we  saw sharath power
pBWp7sZG66o,19591120,19596160,twice in three days so clearly this is a  time uh when uh
pBWp7sZG66o,19596160,19602638,one thing is clear that they are working  in tandem first sharat pawar issues a
pBWp7sZG66o,19602638,19607840,way a whaled warning saying that uh they  should come to mumbai here there will be
pBWp7sZG66o,19607840,19613280,no bjp leaders guiding them like they  are in guwahati and then you have the
pBWp7sZG66o,19613280,19620558,shiv sena batting on the front foot  shift center workers all of a sudden  appeared outside mata shri last night i
pBWp7sZG66o,19620558,19626958,saw that drums start rolling and  today vandalism uh is what we see of the
pBWp7sZG66o,19626958,19634400,house of of the office of uh a leader  who is considered  to have considerable clout in that area
pBWp7sZG66o,19634400,19640400,so uh really uh the the shift center  making it sure that we are the rear
pBWp7sZG66o,19640400,19645840,uddhav is the real chipsena and that's  one reason that we see this meeting of
pBWp7sZG66o,19645840,19651760,the office whereas let me tell you we  should expect more such meetings just uh
pBWp7sZG66o,19651760,19658638,for uddhav and the leadership here to  indicate that we still have the hold  over the party and if it comes to
pBWp7sZG66o,19658638,19663920,anti-defection law uh they will not  qualify as far as both the conditions
pBWp7sZG66o,19663920,19670400,are concerned and anti-defection law  could come into place but this battle  now is going to go on for longer stay
pBWp7sZG66o,19670400,19675520,with me mosby stay with me sarah  bhaktaniya because this battle is  becoming extremely interesting at this
pBWp7sZG66o,19675520,19681760,stage the rebel cena says what is  happening at this national executive  meeting is actually just pressure
pBWp7sZG66o,19681760,19687920,tactics they say we know the law we have  the numbers we've sought recognition  whether it happens at the level of the
pBWp7sZG66o,19687920,19693120,assembly or it happens in courts of law  we will pursue the story but there is
pBWp7sZG66o,19693120,19700080,intimidation intimidation in terms of  sanjay routh  and that's the question that is being  asked
pBWp7sZG66o,19703920,19711440,these were some of the words used by  sanjay rauth in that exclusive  conversation with india today's mosby  singh the uddhav versus

pBWp7sZG66o,19738240,19745040,of maharashtra on friday and angry uttab  sena  workers they vandalized the office of
pBWp7sZG66o,19745040,19752798,mangesh kudalkar in kurla they even  threw black ink and eggs at  ignachinder's poster in nashik shouting
pBWp7sZG66o,19752798,19758080,shouting angry slogans venting their  anger against the rebels and the  leadership and we'll put out those
pBWp7sZG66o,19758080,19764400,multiple images for you all the action  that is taking place whether it's at  kuralkar's office whether it's at the uh
pBWp7sZG66o,19764400,19771520,someone's office or even  at shinde's office shifts in mp sanjay  rao while downplaying the violence by
pBWp7sZG66o,19771520,19777650,ship sanik said this is only the trailer  the real picture is yet to unfold
pBWp7sZG66o,19777650,19783760,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,19783760,19789600,i quickly want to cut across once again  to mash me sing and mush me
pBWp7sZG66o,19789600,19795920,that conversation that you had with  sanjay routh he's made it very clear
pBWp7sZG66o,19797760,19806080,and he says this is actually this should  be expected because this is what shift  cena is all about
pBWp7sZG66o,19809040,19814958,absolutely gaurav i was repeatedly  telling him that you are again issuing a
pBWp7sZG66o,19814958,19820798,threat and this time a direct uh threat  uh it is your government are you tasking
pBWp7sZG66o,19820798,19827120,your shifts and ex to take the law in  their hands and he just  said that this is uh
pBWp7sZG66o,19827120,19832480,just bound to happen this is just  natural uh because they have betrayed uh
pBWp7sZG66o,19832480,19838798,balasab thakras shivsena and this is uh  this is not being provoked in fact i am
pBWp7sZG66o,19838798,19845200,trying to tell uh cena workers that  there's nothing that you need to do but  it's the shift centers that don't that
pBWp7sZG66o,19845200,19850320,never have been that it has never been a  need to tell them what to do and this is
pBWp7sZG66o,19850320,19856718,just natural so in fact he did uh go on  to say that uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,19856718,19863760,they are touring the entire country  going from guwahati from surah to  guwahati and now to goa why don't they
pBWp7sZG66o,19863760,19871280,return to their homes  and  alleging that they have been actually  sold out so really now uh gaurav this
pBWp7sZG66o,19871280,19876480,battle is being fought tooth and nail  fought very aggressively and all the
pBWp7sZG66o,19876480,19882558,cards that are kept close to the heart  are now laid down on the table  oh absolutely
pBWp7sZG66o,19882558,19889840,and and the writing is on the wall sora  bhaktaniya when deepak sarkar one of the  rebel mlas he says my appeal to to
pBWp7sZG66o,19889840,19895680,uddhav takri as the leader of the shift  cena is  to reach out to ships cynics and tell
pBWp7sZG66o,19895680,19901520,them not to resort to violence it's not  correct  reign in leaders like sanjay rauth
pBWp7sZG66o,19901520,19906638,will that will that actually be heard or  not at
pBWp7sZG66o,19909520,19917200,garo all don't think so because uh like  what sanjay routh has said the tone  whatever which would whatever the things
pBWp7sZG66o,19917200,19923200,which god susana do uh srina does that  is decided uh by sanjay rauth and he
pBWp7sZG66o,19923200,19930320,speaks uh for this susena itself  when we clearly saw that he had given an  ultimatum of 24 hours and the 24 hours
pBWp7sZG66o,19930320,19936400,had passed the emotional speeches are  now over now the shifts and will be on  road and yesterday we saw it on the
pBWp7sZG66o,19936400,19942000,grounds of mumbai as well there were  thousands of sonic who gathered on roads  in mumbai some of the offices of the
pBWp7sZG66o,19942000,19949280,memeles was vandalized in the cooler  area now today when we heard his  statement like now it's time to take the
pBWp7sZG66o,19949280,19956878,revenge you can't use the name of susena  and balasab chocolate  after after being a rebel from the party
pBWp7sZG66o,19956878,19962080,it clearly showed on the ground as well  we saw that how tanaji sounds office was
pBWp7sZG66o,19962080,19969440,vandalized and we are seeing the  reaction continuously so this is not  going to stop uh after even the home
pBWp7sZG66o,19969440,19975440,minister is saying that we will be  taking this talk of the situation and  inquiry will be done and such things
pBWp7sZG66o,19975440,19981120,won't happen they are continuously  trying to speak to the police  commissioners as well but i don't think
pBWp7sZG66o,19981120,19987280,so that is going to stop something uh  that is going to stop the sustaining to  do such things on the ground because i
pBWp7sZG66o,19987280,19992878,spoke to some of the sustaining uh also  they clearly said that this is just the  beginning gaurav they are saying that
pBWp7sZG66o,19992878,19998798,this is just the beginning each and  every mlas who have went to guwahati  their offices will be vandalized and
pBWp7sZG66o,19998798,20005520,this is what the ekna cinder group is  claiming and this is can be of threat as  well because clearly the mlas are in
pBWp7sZG66o,20005520,20011200,kuwaiti but their family members are  still in maharashtra they might be  fearing for life for their life as well
pBWp7sZG66o,20011200,20017040,and therefore a letter signed by them  has been sent to the all the  commissioner to the home minister and to
pBWp7sZG66o,20017040,20023920,shift minister without as well so  clearly now a different kind of politics  which deception is earlier known for
pBWp7sZG66o,20023920,20030320,that is something which is coming out  from the party and therefore a meeting  which is going to happen at cena let me
pBWp7sZG66o,20030320,20036240,tell you anil parap who has been  questioned by the ed officials so many  times he has reached yes
pBWp7sZG66o,20036240,20043200,several of the top leaders including  aditya takri sanjay rao all have reached  cena and what we are expecting which was
pBWp7sZG66o,20043200,20050080,not written on the card that is without  chief minister  might be leaving like his convoy is
pBWp7sZG66o,20050080,20057440,already ready over here the police  bundle bus has already increased and he  might to reach cena bhavan so this is a
pBWp7sZG66o,20057440,20063280,huge huge meeting of ut cena at its own  shiv cena bhavan so it will be very
pBWp7sZG66o,20063280,20068718,important to see  what speech he delivers because he  already said
pBWp7sZG66o,20069520,20074798,he has clearly said that so now what the  next speech that buddha creek gives at
pBWp7sZG66o,20074798,20082160,cena will be very important to see only  and after that what reaction does sonic  do on the roads of maharashtra that will
pBWp7sZG66o,20082160,20089280,going to happen after that only you know  and and this is this is a sword and  mostly that conversation that you had
pBWp7sZG66o,20089280,20094320,is extremely interesting and something  that sanjay rao has also been saying a
pBWp7sZG66o,20094320,20099840,sword that sheath  now that rusts but the short sword that
pBWp7sZG66o,20099840,20104840,comes out is gleaming um
pBWp7sZG66o,20108958,20115680,the question is is there an apprehension  that this is actually something that can  that can hit both ways because even the
pBWp7sZG66o,20115680,20121120,rebel senate says we are shift ceilings  and we also follow the ideology of bala
pBWp7sZG66o,20121120,20127280,pakre so this could be violence that is  two ways a fratricidal war
pBWp7sZG66o,20131040,20135600,absolutely gaurav you know our sanjerat
pBWp7sZG66o,20138878,20146000,and i said what are you uh trying to say  that are you saying that uh the the  swords uh that you will rely on swords
pBWp7sZG66o,20146000,20150590,and  guns  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,20153280,20159120,in fact he was in personifying that  exactly uh by issuing that threat uh i'm
pBWp7sZG66o,20159120,20165920,outside shiv sena bhavan i'm just trying  to give the viewers a mood of what's  happening here they say a picture speak
pBWp7sZG66o,20165920,20172480,a thousand words you can see uh that the  enigma that uh bala takri was amongst
pBWp7sZG66o,20172480,20179280,his chivsanics  undoubtedly he enjoyed considerable  clout and at a point when he would raise
pBWp7sZG66o,20179280,20185680,his fingers uh that would see a huge  impact  across not only mumbai but maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,20185680,20192558,and that's one reason that sanjay rawat  kept on invoking bala takre and
pBWp7sZG66o,20192558,20200000,in fact i went on to ask him that that's  the entire argument that shinde is  making that they are the real chivsanics
pBWp7sZG66o,20200000,20206080,of bala takri and shiv this uddhav sena  has actually lost touch uh to which uh
pBWp7sZG66o,20206080,20212480,to which sanji rao actually alleged that  they were being uh  in fact scared they are scared of the
pBWp7sZG66o,20212480,20219520,edie almost 17 mlas of the entire lot  have been armed twisted by the edd the
pBWp7sZG66o,20219520,20225200,agency is to go to guwahati and when  they will come back here almost 21 will
pBWp7sZG66o,20225200,20230878,fall in in the camp he also said that  yesterday remember
pBWp7sZG66o,20230878,20237760,had  yesterday and he also went on to say  that udav uh
pBWp7sZG66o,20238160,20245920,and all the leaders when they were  present they spoke to almost 10 mlas in  guwahati so 10 if that 10 actually adds
pBWp7sZG66o,20245920,20253638,on gaurav it it dwindles the number of  uh the shinde camp for 38 minus 10
pBWp7sZG66o,20253638,20257718,is the latest
pBWp7sZG66o,20269680,20275000,there is some action behind you sort of  what's happening
pBWp7sZG66o,20275520,20281840,yes  yes there is a there is a movement over  here and clearly you can see that the
pBWp7sZG66o,20281840,20288080,complete roads are being blocked that's  the western express highway that has  completely stopped all the vehicular
pBWp7sZG66o,20288080,20294000,movement is completely stopped and just  in some time god  without heart rate the chief minister of
pBWp7sZG66o,20294000,20300240,maharashtra is going to leave his house  of matoshi the police have cleared the
pBWp7sZG66o,20300240,20306878,whole road the convoys are ready there  are lines of several cars and there is  it is and here it is the first car has
pBWp7sZG66o,20306878,20311920,left gaurav and the pilot vehicle has  left this the second car and from here
pBWp7sZG66o,20311920,20319600,we would like to show you the chief  minister uttar thakrei has left here in  the visuals clearly waving at us and
pBWp7sZG66o,20319600,20324878,chief minister utautre has left from  matroshi a very important meeting which
pBWp7sZG66o,20324878,20331120,is going to happen at cena bhavan and  this was not written on the cards it was  said that due to some health issues that
pBWp7sZG66o,20331120,20337680,without thakre might be joining that  particular senahorn meeting through  video conferencing but giving a strong
pBWp7sZG66o,20337680,20344638,statement over here showing the  statement showing the sushanik that he  is right now very much active and he is
pBWp7sZG66o,20344638,20350080,the real shiv cena and therefore now he  has left from his house this is matoshi
pBWp7sZG66o,20350080,20355360,and very likely he's going to reach  there at china very important meeting  like i earlier said and he will be
pBWp7sZG66o,20355360,20363200,delivering a speech over there back to  gaurav now uddhav  going there in person is also meant to
pBWp7sZG66o,20363200,20369760,send out a message saurabh a message  that he's well and truly in control of
pBWp7sZG66o,20369760,20374400,the party if not the mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,20376558,20383600,yes yes absolutely  because there were a lot of issues which  were being raised that uh udot health is
pBWp7sZG66o,20383600,20388638,not good then therefore he's not going  to meet people he also himself said that
pBWp7sZG66o,20388638,20395680,he is having some sort of symptoms of  karuna but having said that all the  things were left apart and when he came
pBWp7sZG66o,20395680,20401040,from virsha to matoshi he stepped down  from his car so many times he is
pBWp7sZG66o,20401040,20407200,continuously meeting the shivsena  leaders from  from the ground level to the top
pBWp7sZG66o,20407200,20414876,ministers as well so he's continuously  having so much of meetings yesterday we  saw how sharath power
pBWp7sZG66o,20421600,20428160,for around two hours the whole strategy  was decided it was given a strong  message that now thou though has to take
pBWp7sZG66o,20428160,20433760,a strong  stand in this whole issue so  continuously without hakra is trying to
pBWp7sZG66o,20433760,20441360,show his presence he's trying to show  that he's very much active in the party  he is taking decision
pBWp7sZG66o,20441360,20446400,and he is with his party beat from the  ground cadre or the minister himself and
pBWp7sZG66o,20446400,20452798,therefore because this was or not on the  cards we've been told that without hakri  might be joining the cena bhavan meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,20452798,20459680,through video conference but now making  a statement that he's very much active  in the party he has left from matoshi so
pBWp7sZG66o,20459680,20466320,many questions were raised about his ill  health but now he'll be going to cena  and he will be addressing a speech where
pBWp7sZG66o,20466320,20473360,huge leds and speakers have been put up  at cena and would be very important to  see what he speaks gaurav
pBWp7sZG66o,20473360,20478718,oh absolutely must be because  for uttaf takre it's the biggest
pBWp7sZG66o,20478718,20484558,challenge so far the split is in the  mlas and two thirds are not with him
pBWp7sZG66o,20484558,20490480,if this extends to the party it's  actually curtains as far as the uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,20490480,20494080,sena is concerned
pBWp7sZG66o,20497760,20504638,you know gaurav in politics it's never  over till it's really over and uh right  now when i'm standing outside of cena
pBWp7sZG66o,20504638,20510480,you can hear the slogan hearing a lot of  optics has been added in the last few  days
pBWp7sZG66o,20510480,20516160,barricading by the police uh the visuals  of him leaving matoshi
pBWp7sZG66o,20516160,20522878,the distance from matoshi to shiv sena  bhavan is about five to ten minutes so  we are expecting with the cm's convoy
pBWp7sZG66o,20522878,20528000,could reach any moment uh now with the  traffic being cleared but this is
pBWp7sZG66o,20528000,20534480,symbolic because yesterday uh udav  didn't come to the senate  when that meeting of the senate promotes
pBWp7sZG66o,20534480,20539840,at the district level took place he has  not stepped out of russia ever since he
pBWp7sZG66o,20539840,20546320,reached there uh two days back so  clearly uh you know this uh  one journey when he took from varsha to
pBWp7sZG66o,20546320,20554160,matu shri was to appeal to get an  emotive appeal  to the ships annex and send a message
pBWp7sZG66o,20554160,20560080,across to the public but today when he  takes that journey from uh mato sri to  shivsen
pBWp7sZG66o,20560080,20567520,it will be about  you know reclaiming it will be about  emphasizing it will be about uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,20567520,20572798,sending a message across that he's the  man he is the shiv sena promo chief and
pBWp7sZG66o,20572798,20577920,he's got a hold over his party because  this battle is now going to be more
pBWp7sZG66o,20577920,20585360,about who is the real senate  all out guns blazing to prove that the
pBWp7sZG66o,20585360,20592558,shifts and shenix and nicks are rallying  behind odaf  so uh you can see that convoys of uh
pBWp7sZG66o,20592558,20598240,nethers are pouring in yesterday he also  met the mps of now look at the visuals
pBWp7sZG66o,20598240,20603440,as soon as there's a buzz that the chief  minister might arrive uh since i
pBWp7sZG66o,20603440,20608558,enthused here remember sanjay route said  that right now we haven't even sent
pBWp7sZG66o,20608558,20616000,across a message  to the corridor remember this is just a  trailer picture
pBWp7sZG66o,20616000,20622080,that itself  you know really puts the entire  maharashtra politics in a state of
pBWp7sZG66o,20622080,20627680,turmoil a government you have the  government of the shivsena uh the the
pBWp7sZG66o,20627680,20633200,entire uh  the entire uh jing bang of emily's
pBWp7sZG66o,20633200,20640160,more than two-thirds sitting in buhari  and here you have the chief minister  with a handful of mlas trying to
pBWp7sZG66o,20640160,20646000,you know enthuse the party workers there  you can see um just uh sanjay our  visuals
pBWp7sZG66o,20646000,20651200,the security is absolutely tight with  reports of shifts anniks
pBWp7sZG66o,20651200,20656638,coming out on streets the police is  actually having a quite a nightmarish of
pBWp7sZG66o,20656638,20662558,a situation uh cena bhavan matoshi all  the nerve centers political nerve
pBWp7sZG66o,20662558,20668638,centers have been kept  very very under very strict vigil and
pBWp7sZG66o,20668638,20675120,here you can see  a battery of police  personnel manning that crossroad the
pBWp7sZG66o,20675120,20680638,road is clear you can see very few  traffic that really means that any time
pBWp7sZG66o,20680638,20686878,you we will see the first uh glimpse of  uh udav takri reaching uh the ships and
pBWp7sZG66o,20686878,20694718,bhavan we did see aditya thakri coming  out yesterday from mata street uh  displaying a sign of a clenched fist
pBWp7sZG66o,20694718,20700558,saying we are we shall indicating that  we shall overcome and hear
pBWp7sZG66o,20700558,20706638,when he reaches today it is going to be  a situation uh where he would be telling
pBWp7sZG66o,20706638,20712320,his carder about how  he has been cheated how he was he's been
pBWp7sZG66o,20712320,20720240,making an emotional appeal in three days  he's made that twice now let's see what  he has on his cards but no facebook no
pBWp7sZG66o,20720240,20726638,social media address this is going to be  a direct one-on-one so shift sena the
pBWp7sZG66o,20726638,20733600,tacri family uh you know playing on the  front foot ah did the tactical  addressing a rally in the evening and
pBWp7sZG66o,20733600,20736958,the ships and x what do they have
pBWp7sZG66o,20746558,20749558,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,20777540,20783310,[Applause]  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,20790958,20796000,so here you are you can see  um  let's look at the cavalcade we will get
pBWp7sZG66o,20796000,20802480,to the first visuals i think we are  getting an indication that he just might  have reached of course the party workers
pBWp7sZG66o,20802480,20807840,i can see a red uh red  uh light beeping
pBWp7sZG66o,20807840,20814080,clearly and there uh perhaps the  cavalcade  going to enter our frame but we'll keep
pBWp7sZG66o,20814080,20821042,on talking to the cena workers sanjay  you keep your eye on the first

pBWp7sZG66o,20998638,21004878,ship  for his national executive many of his  trusted lieutenants
pBWp7sZG66o,21004878,21010480,are also  a part of the national executive and  perhaps action
pBWp7sZG66o,21010480,21015760,taken against them  to prove that the shift cena is still
pBWp7sZG66o,21015760,21023600,under control of uddhav  and we just showed you those visuals  gaurav or what's happening at the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,21023600,21029760,center  as the national executive is about to  start shortly over to you
pBWp7sZG66o,21029760,21037120,absolutely  it's a make or break battle as far as  uddha fakhri and the shift cena are
pBWp7sZG66o,21037120,21042400,concerned the biggest challenge that  uddhav cena faces at this point of time
pBWp7sZG66o,21042400,21046480,as you look at these images of
pBWp7sZG66o,21047440,21053360,the chief minister of maharashtra the  shift cena supremo arriving at the venue
pBWp7sZG66o,21053360,21058400,of the shivsena bhavan for this crucial  national executive meet of the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,21058400,21064320,cena is concerned  38 of his mlas have rebelled 38 of his
pBWp7sZG66o,21064320,21071680,mlas that is two third mlas of the shift  cena  have now formed a separate group
pBWp7sZG66o,21071680,21078958,they have sought recognition as shifts  so it's a big battle for bala
pBWp7sZG66o,21078958,21085040,legacy  whether it's the sun  or the party workers
pBWp7sZG66o,21085040,21093840,38 of them  so he's not talking just as yet  questions are being asked he's masked up
pBWp7sZG66o,21093840,21100160,he waves  beats shifts annex  and then goes in for the national
pBWp7sZG66o,21100160,21106240,executive  because in this very crucial meeting  they will take a decision on what is to
pBWp7sZG66o,21106240,21111520,be done with iknock shinde  and  the 38
pBWp7sZG66o,21111520,21118798,shiv sena mlas who have formed a  separate group and have sought  recognition in the assembly as a
pBWp7sZG66o,21118798,21124400,separate group of the ship cena  they want a separate
pBWp7sZG66o,21124400,21131040,party leader to be recognized they want  a separate  whip to be recognized iknow shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,21131040,21138636,as  the leader  and  as the whip
pBWp7sZG66o,21139900,21145760,[Music]  i once again want to cut across to india  today's mash me sing as we play out
pBWp7sZG66o,21145760,21152160,these images  must mean the biggest challenge that  uddhav takre faces
pBWp7sZG66o,21152160,21158718,to  to his leadership in a way to his  decision to go with the congress and the
pBWp7sZG66o,21158718,21164958,ncp  with majority two third mlas want to go  back with the bjp
pBWp7sZG66o,21164958,21170638,he  has now to decide what action is to be  taken against ignat shinde and the
pBWp7sZG66o,21170638,21177600,others and the next course of action  as far as the rebels are concerned
pBWp7sZG66o,21177600,21183360,huge huge challenge for the legacy of  bala thakrei who would be the inheritor
pBWp7sZG66o,21183360,21188400,moss me a very important aspect is is  this split only in the rebel mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,21188400,21196122,or  can the rebel mlas split the party right  down the middle
pBWp7sZG66o,21198878,21204400,absolutely uh gaurav and that will  always remain a critical criteria uh to
pBWp7sZG66o,21204400,21210160,decide the fate of shiv sena and that's  one reason having lost uh his hold over
pBWp7sZG66o,21210160,21216718,his mlas and ministers now um  is looking to consolidate his base and
pBWp7sZG66o,21216718,21222240,strength as far as the party and the  carter is concerned because remember
pBWp7sZG66o,21222240,21229760,that under the law under the  anti-defection law you have to fulfill  that criteria it isn't enough you've got
pBWp7sZG66o,21229760,21236240,two third mlas you have to show because  uh the the legislature is way just a
pBWp7sZG66o,21236240,21241520,part of the entire party and the party  has several wings it has a functioning
pBWp7sZG66o,21241520,21249040,and under the election commission you  will have to prove that that the party  is actually uh under your control and
pBWp7sZG66o,21249040,21256400,that's the reason that we see all these  movements uh the activity the meetings  the parlays and you know the messaging
pBWp7sZG66o,21256400,21261760,to the carter and all this emotive  appeal because that's what is left as
pBWp7sZG66o,21261760,21268480,far as uh udav can take control of  importantly as you said 16 16 is the
pBWp7sZG66o,21268480,21273760,strength 16 is the number of mlas  against whom uh
pBWp7sZG66o,21273760,21279840,has actually pressed for  disqualification um making a new clp  leader who's been acknowledged by the
pBWp7sZG66o,21279840,21286240,deputy speaker  the clp leader of the shift center has  pressed for disqualification of these 16
pBWp7sZG66o,21286240,21291840,mlas the experts say that it is not so  easy to disqualify mlas they will have
pBWp7sZG66o,21291840,21298718,to come to the assembly uh give their  version and then only the matters can  move forward and thereby you know this
pBWp7sZG66o,21298718,21305760,battle is going to be fought uh also in  the assembly bought in the courts and at  the election commission a multi-pronged
pBWp7sZG66o,21305760,21311120,fight awaits either sides even as they  deliberate the future course of action
pBWp7sZG66o,21311120,21323080,and drama rolls out on the streets  [Applause]
pBWp7sZG66o,21323080,21329600,[Music]  so viewers you will have to understand
pBWp7sZG66o,21329600,21335840,that this uh drama that is rolling out  on the streets is only going to escalate
pBWp7sZG66o,21335840,21344000,and climax yesterday it was kulla today  it was pune and one after the other uh
pBWp7sZG66o,21344000,21352400,rebel air malays are being targeted by  the  uddhav sena clearly udav takre who
pBWp7sZG66o,21352400,21358558,hasn't stepped out of mathuri when he  moved symbolically from varsha packed up
pBWp7sZG66o,21358558,21364400,his bags black suits cases moved out to  his car from russia ever since then
pBWp7sZG66o,21364400,21371280,leaders have come to meet him and he's  been at mato sri but today he chose to
pBWp7sZG66o,21371280,21376958,come out drove out of matoshri arrived  at the ship
pBWp7sZG66o,21376958,21382798,in a move to send a message across to  the rank and file of shiv sena that
pBWp7sZG66o,21382798,21388718,urdhav thakrei is the man in charge he  is the chief minister he is the ship
pBWp7sZG66o,21388718,21394878,senate supremo and he is not  surrendering unlike in the past when a
pBWp7sZG66o,21394878,21400160,24 ultimatum was given uh to the mls to  return back
pBWp7sZG66o,21400160,21405840,unlike in the past when there was  persuasion and maneuvering and talks uh
pBWp7sZG66o,21405840,21413440,you know gaurav this is very important  that there has been a shift in strategy  of the ship cena uh from the udav camp
pBWp7sZG66o,21413440,21419200,from request and  talks about conversation now that the
pBWp7sZG66o,21419200,21426160,ultimatum strategy is  on play right here in mumbai  so what do we expect in this national
pBWp7sZG66o,21426160,21431440,executive meet as we look at these  images of uddhav  arriving at the shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,21431440,21437520,initially we were told moshmi that he  would address  the workers via video conferencing but
pBWp7sZG66o,21437520,21444240,the fact that he's had to come  and be amongst the workers  he's trying to send out a very strong
pBWp7sZG66o,21444240,21450400,message that he's well and truly in  control of the party and that he's with  them he's engaging with them he's
pBWp7sZG66o,21450400,21458000,available to them and that he is in good  health but at the same time  he's is he likely to take very hard
pBWp7sZG66o,21458000,21465362,action against the rebels and the  supporters  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,21469680,21476718,ready to fight for the legacy of  shivsena it is a legacy war he had
pBWp7sZG66o,21476718,21484240,claimed that legacy but now that is  under threat let's get the reaction from  the ships and ex who are here uh sir
pBWp7sZG66o,21484240,21489520,what do you feel why has udav sab come  here to meet uh the office
pBWp7sZG66o,21489520,21495040,to  give just advice  what to do
pBWp7sZG66o,21495040,21500558,what is the next step  they're explaining them  that's okay what was the need do you
pBWp7sZG66o,21500558,21505680,think that today  is under crisis  i don't think no
pBWp7sZG66o,21505680,21510878,no not at all  you just see the  the mahal
pBWp7sZG66o,21510878,21515958,all seniors are here  for support
pBWp7sZG66o,21556798,21559798,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,21587520,21595920,please stay with me stay with me for a  moment  this is the first image and we are going  full frame to it this is this is
pBWp7sZG66o,21595920,21602400,at that national executive meet this at  the shift center office that is ut
pBWp7sZG66o,21602400,21608638,on center stage a very very clear  message that is being sent out he is
pBWp7sZG66o,21608638,21616080,well and truly in control  at the shift
pBWp7sZG66o,21616320,21623280,the bow and arrow the symbol of shiv  cena  behind him the only man there the only
pBWp7sZG66o,21623280,21628878,man  he is the leader that is the very clear
pBWp7sZG66o,21628878,21634638,message that goes out uddhav  sends out the message he is well and
pBWp7sZG66o,21634638,21640320,truly in control of the shift cena  because that's the important message
pBWp7sZG66o,21640320,21646798,that needs to be sent out at this stage  especially with a massive rebellion 38
pBWp7sZG66o,21646798,21653360,mlas two thirds of his party 38 of 55  have rebelled and they have sent short
pBWp7sZG66o,21653360,21658480,of a letter to the deputy speaker in the  assembly saying they want recognition as
pBWp7sZG66o,21658480,21663840,a separate group of the shift cena  calling themselves the shiv seyna bala
pBWp7sZG66o,21663840,21671600,sahib  now uddhaf takri's biggest challenge is  to send out that message they may have
pBWp7sZG66o,21671600,21676958,rebelled with two-thirds numbers but  that will not happen to the party
pBWp7sZG66o,21676958,21682000,because should that happen to the party  there will be a huge challenge
pBWp7sZG66o,21682000,21688480,to him inheriting bala sahib's legacy  so that picture that you see on your
pBWp7sZG66o,21688480,21694718,television screen  is  the chief minister of maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,21694718,21701840,the head of shift cena and sanjay raud  ships in imp in that conversation with  india today's mos me singh made it very
pBWp7sZG66o,21701840,21708558,clear  that's the message must be saying
pBWp7sZG66o,21708558,21714680,that very clearly the shift cena is now  trying to send out
pBWp7sZG66o,21718000,21725280,absolutely you know uh gaurav the  question really is that when  more than half your legislatures uh walk
pBWp7sZG66o,21725280,21730480,out of the party uh to join the rebel  camp then are you really in control and
pBWp7sZG66o,21730480,21736480,here are the shifts and are from the  camp uh stepping in to say that uh we we
pBWp7sZG66o,21736480,21743360,are the real chipsena uh shiv senna is  of the track race it is buy off for uh
pBWp7sZG66o,21743360,21751360,the the the thak rays because it was  balashab takre who started this outfit  and his legacy was uh reclaimed by udav
pBWp7sZG66o,21751360,21757120,tatre udav takre has been in the  in the party he has worked for the party
pBWp7sZG66o,21757120,21762798,for years and uh it shifts sena and tak  ray uh were in fact synonymous so
pBWp7sZG66o,21762798,21769760,really strong words uh those and even as  i insisted that is violence a way is
pBWp7sZG66o,21769760,21775040,taking law in your hands away he said  that this was just a natural outburst of
pBWp7sZG66o,21775040,21782718,shifts who had actually elected these  leaders uh and sent them to the  legislature so uh the battle lines are
pBWp7sZG66o,21782718,21788400,drawn gaurav the lakshman reika many  feel uh in the in the udav camp that the
pBWp7sZG66o,21788400,21796000,mlas have crossed the lakshman record  not on her to the ultimatum and they  have been actually completely uh taken
pBWp7sZG66o,21796000,21801842,away by the bjp and working on the bjp  interesting
pBWp7sZG66o,21803680,21809280,stay with me and let's take this further  the image that says it all
pBWp7sZG66o,21809280,21814400,and the big story  prohibitory orders have been imposed in
pBWp7sZG66o,21814400,21819520,maharashtra prohibitory orders in mumbai  as of now uh exclusive details of what
pBWp7sZG66o,21819520,21825680,will happen in the senate national  executive  a resolution there are three resolutions  that are going to be introduced in this
pBWp7sZG66o,21825680,21831200,key national executive meet of the shift  saying up the shift say now the first  resolution is
pBWp7sZG66o,21831200,21836958,trust in the leadership of uddhav  the man on your television screen trust
pBWp7sZG66o,21836958,21843360,in the leadership which means he is the  only leader on whose orders shifts cena
pBWp7sZG66o,21843360,21851600,and shifts anniks will function  resolution number one resolution number  two action against the 38 mlas who've
pBWp7sZG66o,21851600,21859280,rebelled and stabbed as sanjay routh put  it  in the back when he was unwell
pBWp7sZG66o,21859280,21865840,resolution number three  will not defy the marathi asmita
pBWp7sZG66o,21865840,21872240,and of course the plank of hindu that's  the point that uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,21872240,21881120,has repeatedly been  making he says you can never take us  away from hindutva it is the ideology of
pBWp7sZG66o,21881120,21888400,bala sahib akray the founder of the ship  cena  so will not defy either the marathi
pBWp7sZG66o,21888400,21894958,asmita or  the hindutva ideology
pBWp7sZG66o,21894958,21901280,i once again want to come back to india  today's mos me sing for more on the  story saurabh tanya uh vidya india
pBWp7sZG66o,21901280,21906638,today's biggest team of reporters  tracking this big story we also have  polymer saha
pBWp7sZG66o,21906638,21911920,joining us from guwahati and the 360  degree perspective on the story from
pBWp7sZG66o,21911920,21917520,mumbai to delhi to guwahati we get you  all the action but must be the three
pBWp7sZG66o,21917520,21925716,resolution and the first perhaps being  the most important  trust in leadership of uddhaftakray
pBWp7sZG66o,21929440,21936000,absolutely you know this uh national  executive has not only been called uh  gaurav if you see look at the
pBWp7sZG66o,21936000,21941200,resolutions it is clear that if this  national executive has also been called
pBWp7sZG66o,21941200,21948080,uh for the fact to actually send out a  message to all constitutional  authorities to in fact have it as
pBWp7sZG66o,21948080,21954878,evidence uh that this national national  executive was held and faith in
pBWp7sZG66o,21956798,21964320,and clearly you know  that's one reason that it's not about  it's not about the party it's about the
pBWp7sZG66o,21964320,21968958,individuals whether it  has
pBWp7sZG66o,21969360,21976080,camp is the real ship sena or whether  the youth of camp is the real ship sena  and and the way that uddhav takri
pBWp7sZG66o,21976080,21981840,yesterday uh said it said it all saying  whoever wants to go can go we will
pBWp7sZG66o,21981840,21988638,create a new card we will have new mlas  so really now uh falling back on the
pBWp7sZG66o,21988638,21995120,course trend of the tartray family uh is  uh the party cutter uddhav pinning his
pBWp7sZG66o,21995120,22001200,hopes at the ships on the ships annex  hoping that uh the the wave of support
pBWp7sZG66o,22001200,22007920,uh will pour in from all sides uh for  for uh in this situation even as he he
pBWp7sZG66o,22007920,22014320,plays the card of being a lone warrior  who has been cheated and betrayed by his
pBWp7sZG66o,22014320,22019520,most trusted left in it and remember  that  aditya takre
pBWp7sZG66o,22019520,22026000,very  strategically mentioned that his mother  had said that the one who was brought up
pBWp7sZG66o,22026000,22031760,and grew up with uh in the family has  betrayed us for money so really you know
pBWp7sZG66o,22031760,22037760,getting in the ethical the ethos the  ideological uh value of the shivsena and
pBWp7sZG66o,22037760,22045520,importantly as you mentioned hindutva  you know i would say that hindutva  has been the core issue that has been
pBWp7sZG66o,22045520,22050638,cited for the divide in the shivsera at  least from the rebel camp talking about
pBWp7sZG66o,22050638,22057040,how the shift center had deflected from  the core values of hindu to compromise  for the alliance
pBWp7sZG66o,22057040,22062400,oh absolutely so resolution number one  sarah bhaktaniya is
pBWp7sZG66o,22062400,22068320,trust in the leadership of  very clear attempt to send out that
pBWp7sZG66o,22068320,22075600,message down the rank and file beat  iknak shinde beat anyone else they may  have control of two-thirds of the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,22075600,22081120,mlas but not the party not the  leadership the leadership remains well
pBWp7sZG66o,22081120,22087520,and truly  with uddhav  he is sort of the sole leader
pBWp7sZG66o,22088960,22094798,[Music]  well absolutely god and therefore this  the statement which has been made by ut
pBWp7sZG66o,22094798,22101360,himself that he is going to lead the  party he is very much connected with the  ground creator and all the senior
pBWp7sZG66o,22101360,22108080,ministers and therefore this is the show  of stand this is a show of power which  has been right now happening outside the
pBWp7sZG66o,22108080,22114558,subsidiary and let me tell you guro i  have not seen in the past uh so many  months that uttar takrik going to susana
pBWp7sZG66o,22114558,22121200,bhavan this is hardly that sometime very  important meeting or important press  conference which happens only then
pBWp7sZG66o,22121200,22126480,achievements of the attacker actually  reaches  but hardly in a few years down the line
pBWp7sZG66o,22126480,22132798,uh like uh one year or so i have not  seen chief minister  going to senate but night now is the
pBWp7sZG66o,22132798,22138798,situation it's the movement of the r  that right now at a very crucial piece  of meeting which is happening at the

pBWp7sZG66o,22390000,22395360,the three resolutions and very crucial  resolutions we've spoken of the first uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22395360,22400878,sahil and saurabh and and moshmi which  is trust in the leadership of uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,22400878,22407840,second equally important  is  action against the rebels ikna
pBWp7sZG66o,22407840,22413600,shinde who leads the rebel camp two  third mlas have split they want to be i
pBWp7sZG66o,22413600,22420958,recognized as a separate entity shift  cena  so hard action against them what action
pBWp7sZG66o,22420958,22424556,do we expect saurabh
pBWp7sZG66o,22427040,22433440,so well uh party will definitely take  actions uh we need to understand that
pBWp7sZG66o,22433440,22438718,ncp ibego pattern ncp is continuously  trying to put pressure on shiv sena and
pBWp7sZG66o,22438718,22445120,chief minister rudow thak ray that they  need to come out with a strong message  they need to take a tough decision right
pBWp7sZG66o,22445120,22451840,now and therefore let me tell you the  inside information which is coming out  that ekna cindy might be removed from
pBWp7sZG66o,22451840,22458080,the post of party leader now what is  this post god we need to understand  party leader basically what the susan
pBWp7sZG66o,22458080,22464480,call is the post of neta inside this  neta is a very important post let me
pBWp7sZG66o,22464480,22473080,tell you in the whole shifts in a party  there are only four nethers and one of  them is ekna chinder other is uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22477520,22482878,himself so what we are learning is that  ma he might be removed from the post of
pBWp7sZG66o,22482878,22488480,neta some action might be taken on  ramdas kadam as well because we are not  saying visuals of ramdas kadam in this
pBWp7sZG66o,22488480,22495520,particular important meeting because  ramdas kadam have spoken out against the  party in fact his son who is mla is
pBWp7sZG66o,22495520,22502558,right now sitting in guwahati with the  rebel camp so right now the message will  be very clear that look shiv sinha is
pBWp7sZG66o,22502558,22508000,the party of bala takre and after baal  takri is the uddo takre who is running
pBWp7sZG66o,22508000,22514638,the whole shift cena and is very much on  ground even if his health conditions are  not good he's coming out of his house
pBWp7sZG66o,22514638,22520400,he's meeting the party leader he's  addressing a speech he's continuously  doing several rounds of meeting not
pBWp7sZG66o,22520400,22527840,remaining in contact with the sort of  important point that you make there and  most me the conversation that you had
pBWp7sZG66o,22527840,22533200,with sanjay rauth he repeatedly made  that point that the time for reproachma
pBWp7sZG66o,22533200,22539760,the time for reaching out to the rebels  is now over and now is the time for hard
pBWp7sZG66o,22539760,22544958,action is that what we see is that what  resolution number two is all about most
pBWp7sZG66o,22544958,22547120,me
pBWp7sZG66o,22550240,22555280,you know  we must dwell over why the  entire
pBWp7sZG66o,22555280,22562320,conversation and the talk about  you know persuasion and talk about  coming back and calling them back why
pBWp7sZG66o,22562320,22567520,that entire conversation snapped uh the  thing is that when uh eknatch and they
pBWp7sZG66o,22567520,22575360,went with 25 mlas  and his camp kept swelling that was a  bit of an embarrassment for the for
pBWp7sZG66o,22575360,22580558,he seemed to be like a king  without any soldiers without an army and
pBWp7sZG66o,22580558,22586320,uh  sitting in his throne in russia and uh  so you know
pBWp7sZG66o,22586320,22592320,sanjay routh has been an ideologue of  the party he has been a master  strategist there has been a lot of
pBWp7sZG66o,22592320,22598798,thinking behind it and sharad pawar when  he went to warsha remember after that uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22598798,22604000,left was russia so sharat pawar meeting  uddhav takri one on one twice in three
pBWp7sZG66o,22604000,22609040,days had a lot to do with the fact that  in tandem the way the ncp and the ships
pBWp7sZG66o,22609040,22616320,are now moving they've been seen in  public together uh they've been meeting  the second rung leaders going to uh meet
pBWp7sZG66o,22616320,22622558,ncp leaders so uh the the equation uh  shared between them has been a message
pBWp7sZG66o,22622558,22627920,to the iknow cindy camp uh as well that  uh that would have taken will stick with
pBWp7sZG66o,22627920,22633120,the status quo because he is committed  to the mba and on the other hand things
pBWp7sZG66o,22633120,22640558,that started turning from bad to worse  when the camp actually crossed the uh  two third majority figure mark stay with
pBWp7sZG66o,22640558,22647200,me stay with me mosby big story coming  in and top sources are telling india  today that the deputy speaker naruhari
pBWp7sZG66o,22647200,22652480,jirwal in the maharashtra assembly is  likely to issue notices to the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,22652480,22657520,mlas whose disqualification has been  sought and these notices are ready they
pBWp7sZG66o,22657520,22662798,are likely to be dispatched anytime now  because legal opinion has already been
pBWp7sZG66o,22662798,22668558,sought whether the disqualification  proceedings can be conducted and whether
pBWp7sZG66o,22668558,22674000,notices for disqualification can be  issued at a time when two independent
pBWp7sZG66o,22674000,22682160,mlas had said that they have no  confidence in the deputy speaker of the  maharashtra assembly so 16 mlas we are
pBWp7sZG66o,22682160,22689200,told are likely to receive notices on  the disqualification proceedings i want  to bring in sahil joshi once again into
pBWp7sZG66o,22689200,22694400,this conversation sahil legal opinion  shot two independent mla said they had
pBWp7sZG66o,22694400,22701120,no confidence in the deputy speaker and  that was the hope that once he's in the  line of fire himself he cannot send out
pBWp7sZG66o,22701120,22707760,disqualification notice but he still  it seems he can and he will
pBWp7sZG66o,22708320,22715440,well the no confidence portion was  initiated by the akina shinde group with  the uh signature of 34 mlas uh on the
pBWp7sZG66o,22715440,22722240,day when uh uh when the deputy speaker  accepted shivsera's claim and changed  the leadership of the party to ajay
pBWp7sZG66o,22722240,22727280,chaudhary and removed ekta chinde as the  leader of shiv cena's legislative party
pBWp7sZG66o,22727280,22734000,now what the deputy speaker's office has  informed the nation the group is that  one the email came
pBWp7sZG66o,22734000,22740240,you know to register this no confidence  motion have come from some unknown email  id  which cannot be recognized whose email
pBWp7sZG66o,22740240,22746400,id needs to be clarified secondly the  signatures on that particular letter are
pBWp7sZG66o,22746400,22753920,the you know it's kind of a xerox copy  they need the original signatures in  hand at this point of time to register
pBWp7sZG66o,22753920,22759760,uh this protest and uh you know go ahead  with the no confidence motion so that  confidence motion has been rejected
pBWp7sZG66o,22759760,22766000,secondly uh now short time from a while  they are also going to issue notices on
pBWp7sZG66o,22766000,22773520,the no confidence motion  on the on the disqualification notices  to uh the mlas uh whose disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,22773520,22779120,have been shot by the shift center udder  group uh almost 16 mlas have been you
pBWp7sZG66o,22779120,22785840,know 16 petitions have been filed in  front of deputy speaker now one by one  they will be given 48 hours time to
pBWp7sZG66o,22785840,22792718,respond to those notices so that is  going to be a long time battle  on one hand secondly shinde is not been
pBWp7sZG66o,22792718,22799520,recognized as the deputies as the by  deputy speakers office as the leader of  shiv sena in maharashtra legislative
pBWp7sZG66o,22799520,22805360,assembly so that is another fight and  that is the reason why uh you know  deepak sarkar today while speaking to us
pBWp7sZG66o,22805360,22811440,said that they are going to form a  separate group by the name shiv cena  bala say whether it india agrees to that
pBWp7sZG66o,22811440,22818240,that's a different question altogether  so you know on multiple level now uh  this fight is going on now also i would
pBWp7sZG66o,22818240,22826080,like to bring in some inside details of  what happened yesterday what transpired  uh between uh sharat pawar praful patel
pBWp7sZG66o,22826080,22832718,ajit pawar and uddav takri when they  went to meet udav takariya yesterday at  patushri uh you know the last line what
pBWp7sZG66o,22832718,22837760,shahrukh pawar had told uh uh told  is that we are with you at this point of
pBWp7sZG66o,22837760,22844718,time explore your all options because  uddhav kept telling them that i still  believe that some of the mlas will come
pBWp7sZG66o,22844718,22852638,back to me i've kept my doors open the  people who went on the first day to  surah some of the mlas from that lot are
pBWp7sZG66o,22852638,22858320,in touch with me they are messaging me  and they are talking to me it looks like  that when they come back they might come
pBWp7sZG66o,22858320,22865120,back to us that's why  that part of the conversation sahil  those interesting inside details that
pBWp7sZG66o,22865120,22870160,you've scooped out ten mlas that is what  uh uddhav thakura is reported to have
pBWp7sZG66o,22870160,22875680,claimed in that meeting with sharad  pawar at least 10 mlas are in touch with  him
pBWp7sZG66o,22875680,22882000,be that as it may  this would actually indicate that  iknack shinde does not have the
pBWp7sZG66o,22882000,22890638,two-thirds numbers that he requires if  10 want to come back to the party fold  21 is what is claimed by sanjay routh
pBWp7sZG66o,22890878,22897760,well right now it is just a claim you  know right now what is the present  situation that these mlas are there
pBWp7sZG66o,22897760,22903680,sitting in guwahati sending letters  signing on the letters uh given by uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22903680,22909200,they are not ready to come back right  now because they actually cannot come  back so this is a claim by uttar takare
pBWp7sZG66o,22909200,22915360,are they messaging  are they in touch with those  through the messages my sources say yes
pBWp7sZG66o,22915360,22921680,they have been smsing with the  but does that mean that they will come  back without the full that is something  we don't know yet
pBWp7sZG66o,22921680,22927600,that will we will come to know only when  these people will come back right now it  is a claim game it is not the game we
pBWp7sZG66o,22927600,22933600,are seeing at this point of time  secondly right now uddha takara's  priority as you had rightly mentioned to
pBWp7sZG66o,22933600,22940240,take control of the party because he  knows that if tomorrow uh you know more  ranks from the shifts in our scatter
pBWp7sZG66o,22940240,22946160,joint shinden and that there will be  difficulty to control the party but it  doesn't look like because iknow knows
pBWp7sZG66o,22946160,22952958,that he holds the key in the legislative  party group not in the party at this  point of time the district presidents
pBWp7sZG66o,22952958,22958160,the vibhatra books uh you know the other  uh smaller shaka prabhu are still with
pBWp7sZG66o,22958160,22964478,uddhav there may be some people who will  uh you know um quit the party and join  aknac uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22964478,22970558,i cannot predict at this point of time  whether eventually ekna chinde will  merge his group uh in the bjp or he uh
pBWp7sZG66o,22970558,22976718,you know he thinks that he should run a  separate party that is something is not  yet clear yet but at this point of time
pBWp7sZG66o,22976718,22982718,uttar takaras priority is to first take  control of the party what happens  eventually it's something going to come
pBWp7sZG66o,22982718,22989040,come later he is and one of the  criticisms that  was repeatedly facing sahil was that he
pBWp7sZG66o,22989040,22995680,wasn't approachable that people could  not reach out to him is that the reason  that he's repeatedly
pBWp7sZG66o,22995680,23000798,coming in contact with the workers  whether it's stopping his car coming out  on the streets meeting his people or
pBWp7sZG66o,23000798,23006798,coming to the ship saying right now  sahil  well gaurav that is that is one of the
pBWp7sZG66o,23006798,23014320,things whenever the leader is cornered  and and told that you know this is why  your people are going away at least uh
pBWp7sZG66o,23014320,23019360,you know he tries to show that that is  not the case now what is happening  behind the uh you know behind the
pBWp7sZG66o,23019360,23024798,curtains uddhav  is messaging his mlas whoever is  responding to him he's thinking that
pBWp7sZG66o,23024798,23031680,okay they might come back his wife  rashmi takra has been calling  those mla's houses and speaking to their
pBWp7sZG66o,23031680,23037360,spouses and talking to them asking that  we are the family why don't you come  back we are not going to fire you we are
pBWp7sZG66o,23037360,23043520,not going to take action once you are in  mumbai my doors are open to you so you  know multiple way emotional blackmailing
pBWp7sZG66o,23043520,23050000,threat uh you know the shift center is  going to the various offices look at the  offices uh look at the look at the
pBWp7sZG66o,23050000,23056400,places where the offices were attacked  these are the people who they know for  sure are not going to come back like say
pBWp7sZG66o,23056400,23061440,tana g7 tanaji savant is one of the  front runners who created this reward  along with
pBWp7sZG66o,23061440,23067760,it that's why his office was attacked  he promised  that he's not going to um you know go to
pBWp7sZG66o,23067760,23074798,guwahati but still he managed to go and  that is what have anguished  yesterday during the meeting uh
pBWp7sZG66o,23074798,23081440,ncp leaders did ask udav takari that how  this is happening how this is possible  that the shift cynics are not coming on
pBWp7sZG66o,23081440,23086958,the ground in the past whenever such  kind of thing have happened shift  scenics have come on the ground agitated
pBWp7sZG66o,23086958,23092400,why this is not happening at this point  of time uddaf told them that  deliberately we have asked ships and
pBWp7sZG66o,23092400,23098400,it's not to do this because some of the  mlas who want to come back might get  upset if they are attacked their houses
pBWp7sZG66o,23098400,23105360,are attacked their offices are attacked  we don't want to touch them and that is  the reason why they didn't come on the  ground the sharing thing
pBWp7sZG66o,23105360,23111440,was one minute uh second thing which  without taking was asked by these ncp  leaders that how is it possible that the
pBWp7sZG66o,23111440,23119440,mlas who were present uh for the meeting  in warsaw were present with you in the  hotel the immediately the same evening
pBWp7sZG66o,23119440,23125440,went to surat and went to  guwahati by the chartered flight is your  hand in this that is what people are
pBWp7sZG66o,23125440,23131920,talking about uttar takri immediately  clarified he laughed on that and after  that in the evening when he addressed
pBWp7sZG66o,23131920,23138000,the shifts and our cooperators the  forward corporators and the local level  products he made it very clear that why
pBWp7sZG66o,23138000,23144080,would i backstab myself i'm not par i  have no part in this i'm not supporting  this this is
pBWp7sZG66o,23144080,23151280,this this this doesn't have my blessings  the pa i am still standing with the  mahavikas agari i am not with aknachinde
pBWp7sZG66o,23151280,23157760,group this is not a ploy i have created  so that i can go with the bjp and i you  know ditch congress ncp that he wanted
pBWp7sZG66o,23157760,23164160,to  he he cleared it uh to his people  yesterday so there are multiple  confusions within the kara which i think
pBWp7sZG66o,23164160,23170400,uttara takaris now started clearing up  but still the main fight remains the  legal fight which is going to be in the
pBWp7sZG66o,23170400,23177120,court now the disqualification notices  will be served after that that will be  challenged whether the ektachendes group
pBWp7sZG66o,23177120,23182718,gets a separate uh recognition or iknac  still wants to go for the whole kill he
pBWp7sZG66o,23182718,23188080,wants to lead the party in maharashtra  legislative assembly and still will  claim that i am the leader of the
pBWp7sZG66o,23188080,23193200,legislative assembly group it's  something what we need to be seen but  right now as per deepak sarkar they are
pBWp7sZG66o,23193200,23198638,going to form a separate group called  shiv sinha palasef that is what going on  at this point of time it's going to be a
pBWp7sZG66o,23198638,23205200,long-term battle or if it ends by next  week it's something what we have to do  and one more last thing governor
pBWp7sZG66o,23205200,23211600,bjp has not uttered a word yet today  they had a core committee meeting but  they didn't say a word bjp is still
pBWp7sZG66o,23211600,23216878,watching the situation they they have  not yet come on the ground they have not  yet gone to the governor they have
pBWp7sZG66o,23216878,23222878,written only one letter asking the  governor to just to take a cognizance  that there are decisions being taken by
pBWp7sZG66o,23222878,23228958,the maharashtra cabinet yesterday when  asked to ajit pawar ajit power said that  the government is still functioning we
pBWp7sZG66o,23228958,23234798,still have the majority we are running  the government the no confidence vote  has not yet passed uh in the assembly so
pBWp7sZG66o,23234798,23241360,that means we are in the government we  can take the decisions so the bjp is  slowly coming into the picture right now
pBWp7sZG66o,23241360,23246638,they have just informed the governor  take cognizance of the situation they  have not made any kind of demand yet
pBWp7sZG66o,23246638,23251920,interesting  is also joining us on the broadcast

pBWp7sZG66o,23258958,23264080,degree perspective on this big  fast-paced developing story and polymer
pBWp7sZG66o,23264080,23271440,notices have been issued to the 16  rebel mlas we are being told that
pBWp7sZG66o,23271440,23277360,the no confidence email was sent from an  unrecognized email and that is why no
pBWp7sZG66o,23277360,23285840,cognizance has been taken offered  what more do we know of the  disqualification notices follow me
pBWp7sZG66o,23288400,23295280,well uh whatever what we do know is that  they have been dispatched or to uh are  to be shortly dispatched we also know
pBWp7sZG66o,23295280,23301600,that there is a meeting of the eighth  not shinde camp inside hotel radisson  blue at about 2 p.m which should have
pBWp7sZG66o,23301600,23308478,started at the moment all of this is  going to come up for uh discussion also  earlier
pBWp7sZG66o,23309520,23313080,i'm just cutting across
pBWp7sZG66o,23325840,23327920,a
pBWp7sZG66o,23346190,23349250,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,23370400,23376958,stay with me  interesting interesting mostly that  conversation that you've had with anil  this is a member of parliament who's
pBWp7sZG66o,23376958,23382080,saying that the process seeking the  disqualification of 16 mlas that's
pBWp7sZG66o,23382080,23390718,currently underway and polymer if i  could come back to you  by 5 p.m monday we are told these 16
pBWp7sZG66o,23390718,23398400,mlas have been asked to respond why they  should not be disqualified follow me
pBWp7sZG66o,23400878,23406958,that's right what we're learning is uh  that uh those notices are to be shortly  dispatched so they will probably reach
pBWp7sZG66o,23406958,23414240,of course over email official email to  these mlas who are of course hold up  inside hotel radisson blue in guwahati
pBWp7sZG66o,23414240,23419520,and what we've learned earlier from our  sources obviously we're here to see uh  those uh summons copy or those noticed
pBWp7sZG66o,23419520,23425360,copies uh from the deputy speaker's  office but earlier when we'd spoken to  our sources uh we had learned that it
pBWp7sZG66o,23425360,23431200,would uh give a 48 hour to a 72 hour  window for these mlas these 16 rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,23431200,23436558,mlas to in fact come forward in person  to the maharashtra legislative assembly  so the deadline could possibly end by
pBWp7sZG66o,23436558,23443600,monday evening as you were saying uh to  come forward to maharashtra legislative  assembly or respond uh through email
pBWp7sZG66o,23443600,23449440,through a valid email address which can  be of course authenticated that indeed  comes from the the particular mla who
pBWp7sZG66o,23449440,23454798,has been served that notice so that  would be an option as well that they  send in their response to the summits
pBWp7sZG66o,23454798,23461040,which has been issued to them on the  basis of the disqualification motion  moved against these 16 rebel mlas by the
pBWp7sZG66o,23461040,23466878,shiv sena so that is the plan uh that is  of course uh  that is of course happening as far as
pBWp7sZG66o,23466878,23472160,the deputy speaker's office is concerned  right behind me in the radisson blue  hotel of course the ignition day camp is
pBWp7sZG66o,23472160,23477360,a meeting and they are of course  strategizing their future course of  action earlier as well wait reported
pBWp7sZG66o,23477360,23484240,about the fact that again why did i  stress on the authentic email address  part because when reported about the  fact that as far as the no confidence
pBWp7sZG66o,23484240,23490638,motion is concerned of the 21st of june  from the shinde camp against the uh  deputy speaker asking for him to be
pBWp7sZG66o,23490638,23497040,removed because he had allowed for the  legislative party leader to be changed  was again sent from an inauthentic email
pBWp7sZG66o,23497040,23503840,address a private email address that did  not seem to belong to any of these mlas  who are inside radisson blue hotel and
pBWp7sZG66o,23503840,23509680,as far as the two independent nebulas  are concerned the bjp supported mla  which is the mr baldi and we know the
pBWp7sZG66o,23509680,23515920,garbage they have just gone to narhary  serval and said you cannot take any sort  of action against these 16 rebel mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,23515920,23522400,you cannot disqualify them because there  is no confidence motion against you  hence you're not qualified enough to
pBWp7sZG66o,23522400,23529360,disqualify anyone else but they have not  issued a notice they have not uh put  anything down on paper so clearly no
pBWp7sZG66o,23529360,23535520,confidence motion rejected the first one  from 27 june and there's nothing fresh  in front of the deputy speaker so he is
pBWp7sZG66o,23535520,23541760,free to take any sort of action that he  wishes to take at the moment as it sees  follow me
pBWp7sZG66o,23541760,23547040,and sahil stay with me on this big story  fast-paced developments taking place in

pBWp7sZG66o,24392958,24399280,clear that when action is taken against  the 38 rebels it could lead to a fight

pBWp7sZG66o,24449040,24455600,not  fit to be the cn he can step down but  the rebel leaders need to speak to him
pBWp7sZG66o,24455600,24462478,but again there came another statement  where they again mentioned this thing  sanjay routh also mentioned another had
pBWp7sZG66o,24462478,24467600,also mentioned that they are not going  to forgive these rebels and that is why
pBWp7sZG66o,24467600,24473120,now it seems that the uh the period  where uh they could be forgiven the
pBWp7sZG66o,24473120,24480478,rebels could be forgiven is over the  disqualification process has been  initiated for 16 mlas and there could be
pBWp7sZG66o,24480478,24486958,action against them there could be  action initiated by udav takre and his
pBWp7sZG66o,24486958,24492798,loyal cadders against the rebels uh  there could be disqualification also a
pBWp7sZG66o,24492798,24499600,legal uh battle could be uh it could  start very soon between the rebel  leaders and uh
pBWp7sZG66o,24499600,24504958,udav shivsena meanwhile  these protesters as we see over here
pBWp7sZG66o,24504958,24511760,have gathered in support of it  this is a show of strength being done by
pBWp7sZG66o,24511760,24517920,the local supporters of iknow and  as you pointed out that there could be
pBWp7sZG66o,24517920,24524798,in future there could be trouble between  the supporters of udav shivsena and the
pBWp7sZG66o,24524798,24530160,supporters of ekinak shinde so it is  suspected by the police and that is why
pBWp7sZG66o,24530160,24535760,measures are being taken by police  officials section 144 is being imposed
pBWp7sZG66o,24535760,24540958,security is being beefed up at uh  residences of these leaders the huge
pBWp7sZG66o,24540958,24546400,police presence can be seen in areas  censored in sensitive areas where uh
pBWp7sZG66o,24546400,24553200,huge presence of shifters is there uh  from both the sites and that
pBWp7sZG66o,24553200,24560080,police have also  imposed sections like 144 and few other  sections so that no underworld incident
pBWp7sZG66o,24560080,24566638,happens so that no law and order  situation happens give me a moment i  quickly want to come across to gohati

pBWp7sZG66o,24898320,24903680,that's right in fact that is what uh  what khaki has been embarrassing uh in  the past
pBWp7sZG66o,24903680,24910718,yesterday when he in fact via video  conference he was  speaking uh  clinics and his leaders uh for the party
pBWp7sZG66o,24910718,24916320,who are visited at the moment who said  the same thing that this is the blood  and sweat for galaxies
pBWp7sZG66o,24916320,24923280,and what they've done today is betray  that uh while of course are going ahead  how can they call themselves the in fact
pBWp7sZG66o,24923280,24930240,followers of balance and focus when they  basically uh are using abusive language  making faceless allegations against the
pBWp7sZG66o,24930240,24935760,same faculty family itself she in fact  challenged them but indeed if you have
pBWp7sZG66o,24935760,24941200,the courage to fight it out from there  on your own and you do believe that you  are mass leaders then you should go out
pBWp7sZG66o,24941200,24946320,there and basically uh give up the name  of galatians give up the name of
pBWp7sZG66o,24946320,24953040,and then go fight for your own mind and  then of course and bring voters on board  with you as well so he has been invoking
pBWp7sZG66o,24953040,24959280,uh the legacy of a palestinian party and  he has thought his force uh has been  speaking about how he has no sense of
pBWp7sZG66o,24959280,24965920,attachment to anything it took him he  said just a snap decision to walk out of  russia and move back to baton rouge
pBWp7sZG66o,24965920,24973520,because it was not his choice as he said  he never  he never had enough of power it was not  a choice to become the chief minister it
pBWp7sZG66o,24973520,24979120,was of course the decision of all the  allies who asked him to become the chief  minister he said this is not what i
pBWp7sZG66o,24979120,24984478,dreamt about ever to becoming the chief  minister if someone else wanted to be  the chief minister they could have
pBWp7sZG66o,24984478,24990000,spoken to me they could have had a  conversation and a dialogue with me  because this is not what i was thirsting
pBWp7sZG66o,24990000,24996000,for this power i was not thirsting for  it but for them to betray me when i was  unwell when i was recovering i had to go
pBWp7sZG66o,24996000,25002638,to back-to-back operations and surgeries  for them to betray me at such a crucial  time when this uh state was battling the
pBWp7sZG66o,25002638,25009440,forward 19 pandemic was one of the most  affected and our entire energies and  resources were dedicated towards it and
pBWp7sZG66o,25009440,25014878,because of which i couldn't meet people  at that point of time their challenge  and their allegation is that i don't

pBWp7sZG66o,25027200,25032798,with i had to keep some amount of  distance but it didn't mean that i  wasn't taking decisions it doesn't mean
pBWp7sZG66o,25032798,25038718,that i've been listening to the people  on the ground i in fact continue the  cabinet meeting straight away one week

pBWp7sZG66o,25715680,25722000,takri and takre is  shiv sena so clearly  at this point of time uh we've also
pBWp7sZG66o,25722000,25728478,spoken to anil desai who stressed on the  fact that  action would be taken against uh
pBWp7sZG66o,25728478,25734558,the specific leaders who have rebelled  against the party and uh this is about
pBWp7sZG66o,25734558,25740240,not only uh the mlas but it is about the  shift center as a whole which is a party
pBWp7sZG66o,25740240,25747200,and the mlas are just a wing off of the  party so uttam takri they're reinforcing

pBWp7sZG66o,25861680,25867360,his best to ensure that election  commission moves in uh so that iknow

pBWp7sZG66o,26122160,26126958,falling here right outside the ship cena
pBWp7sZG66o,26127920,26133360,pouring in slogans  reverberating in the air and the drama
pBWp7sZG66o,26133360,26137600,out playing out in full swing
pBWp7sZG66o,26138478,26144878,stay with me i have two of the finest  reporters getting us the latest updates  from ground zero mostly singh from
pBWp7sZG66o,26144878,26150080,mumbai and palami sahab uh joins us from  guwahati so mosh me and polymer stay
pBWp7sZG66o,26150080,26156000,with me as we take this conversation  forward palmy  the fights that are happening on the
pBWp7sZG66o,26156000,26161440,streets the protests that are happening  and the fact that uddhav takri says he's
pBWp7sZG66o,26161440,26167440,they're reaching out to the election  commission saying do not permit the  rebels to take that name of bala sahib
pBWp7sZG66o,26167440,26174958,they cannot call themselves shiv sena  bala sahib that stays with us do we  expect a quick reaction or a response
pBWp7sZG66o,26174958,26183158,from the rebels because now it's very  clearly a fight for the inheritance of  the legacy of ballasia tahrir
pBWp7sZG66o,26185280,26192160,well uh definitely because the rebel  camp will be holding a press conference  via video link at 4 pm today so in a
pBWp7sZG66o,26192160,26198558,short while from now in about 45 minutes  from now in fact deepak sarkar rebel mla  will be addressing a press conference
pBWp7sZG66o,26198558,26203920,after that meeting that the shinde  faction is holding right now as we speak
pBWp7sZG66o,26203920,26209360,inside hotel radisson blue in guwahati  remember it is a proposal that mr deepak
pBWp7sZG66o,26209360,26215440,sarkar referred to in that interview to  india today where he said that the  proposal is uh that uh you know we re
pBWp7sZG66o,26215440,26223280,name the party name our good our group  uh shivseena balasai but that is  something which remains uh to be seen if
pBWp7sZG66o,26223280,26230080,not shinde of course uh like i spoke to  some of the mlas inside and they said it  will be uh ignacion days uh decision so
pBWp7sZG66o,26230080,26236718,uh it remains to be seen what emerges  out of that meeting if indeed they go  forward uh and in call their group uh
pBWp7sZG66o,26236718,26242798,this uh new name of shiv sena balasaya  but we've been speaking to experts as  well who are of course following the
pBWp7sZG66o,26242798,26249360,legalities and the nitty gritties of  this battle which has begun between the  udav takari led faction and the iknow
pBWp7sZG66o,26249360,26254878,led faction and what they're saying that  the fact that they're going to call  their grouping something else completely
pBWp7sZG66o,26254878,26261120,different is not going to in any way  help their cause in the larger way  because it will still be about the
pBWp7sZG66o,26261120,26266398,disqualification notice which has been  moved against 16 rebel mlas by
pBWp7sZG66o,26266398,26272320,and if at all as per the tension deal of  the indian constitution they are to say  that we are two-thirds majority of the
pBWp7sZG66o,26272320,26278398,legislative party and hence we are the  actual ship saying it doesn't work that  way they have to in fact go in for a
pBWp7sZG66o,26278398,26283520,merger and their options are limited to  one bjp again that will be a perception
pBWp7sZG66o,26283520,26289440,blow from for them because uh uh that is  something that a ship senate would not  want to do which is give up their own
pBWp7sZG66o,26289440,26294558,identity to merge into the bhartiya jada  party and the second option uh like
pBWp7sZG66o,26294558,26301360,someone pointed out to me um a high  functionary within the shiv zayn at the  moment said is uh uh the prahar jan
pBWp7sZG66o,26301360,26308398,shakti party the prahar jan shakti party  is led by bachukaru and bachukaru and a  second mla they have two mlas are
pBWp7sZG66o,26308398,26313840,currently inside hotel radisson blue  wait uh in fact uh it not shinde so they
pBWp7sZG66o,26313840,26320000,are counted among the others that we've  been counting the nine others that we  count so they are a small party they are
pBWp7sZG66o,26320000,26326798,of course uh registered they are a  registered uh recognized party but not a  registered party so that is going to be
pBWp7sZG66o,26326798,26333680,extremely tough how how are you going to  merge yourself into the prahajan shakti  party again legal battles
pBWp7sZG66o,26333680,26340320,these are the technical legal battles  ahead stay with me paula me stay with me  mosh me i also want to bring our guests
pBWp7sZG66o,26340320,26347360,into this conversation here on this  india today special broadcast i have  abhishek tripati uh joining me abhishek
pBWp7sZG66o,26347360,26354638,supports the bhartiya janta party  chandra  is of the ncp ravish shivastav is a
pBWp7sZG66o,26354638,26361840,political analyst and welcome uh on this  broadcast and chandrasekhar i want to  begin by asking you sir
pBWp7sZG66o,26361840,26368958,why would  there be a problem if the iknot shinde  faction of the shiv cena want to call
pBWp7sZG66o,26368958,26374798,themselves as deepak sarkar argues shift  cena
pBWp7sZG66o,26376080,26382958,see the  issue is the now a legal battle  uh if they call themselves an outfit of
pBWp7sZG66o,26382958,26388878,ships  they have to get it registered from the  election commission uh there are issues
pBWp7sZG66o,26388878,26396638,regarding that because they have to uh  have a no objection from uh ships in  originally uh and eventually
pBWp7sZG66o,26396638,26404240,uh shipshana party has been formed in  1966  by bala sahib now this party cannot be
pBWp7sZG66o,26404240,26411040,in any manner changed or it cannot be  inherited by others it can only be  transferred to their legal heads or the
pBWp7sZG66o,26411040,26417920,successions uh which they are having now  uh the issue is uh calling an outfit as
pBWp7sZG66o,26417920,26424080,section of allah  that means they have  now themselves
pBWp7sZG66o,26424080,26431760,called them as a benefited traitors  of the party they are now not the  citizens of the party and creators of
pBWp7sZG66o,26431760,26437280,the party you say why are they traitors  of the party  yes they are the traitors of the party
pBWp7sZG66o,26437280,26442320,what what they are doing they are taking  shelter
pBWp7sZG66o,26443520,26449680,okay give me 30 seconds as i try and  re-establish that link with you ravi  srivastav is this leading to a
pBWp7sZG66o,26449680,26455920,fratricide on the streets of maharashtra  is it now very clearly cena versus cena
pBWp7sZG66o,26455920,26461360,in maharashtra offices of rebel leaders  being vandalized  and
pBWp7sZG66o,26461360,26466878,rebel leader supporters also taking to  the streets now like in tarne  taural
pBWp7sZG66o,26466878,26474080,uh i think now eknat shinde is standing  on a thin ice  this is not reaching anywhere first of
pBWp7sZG66o,26474080,26480000,all you know person sitting 2600  kilometer away writing letters to the
pBWp7sZG66o,26480000,26487360,governor to the deputy speaker to the  election commission nobody is going to  take a cognizance of that because he is
pBWp7sZG66o,26487360,26493920,not present on the soil to which he  wants to claim that i want to be a bala
pBWp7sZG66o,26493920,26501840,say now whatever it is second thing is  that all these things now are heading  towards the courts and the more time
pBWp7sZG66o,26501840,26508320,passes the more stalemate will continue  and eknatch they will lose the
pBWp7sZG66o,26508320,26515680,grip on these  mlas whosoever are there another thing  is now thak rays have started talking to
pBWp7sZG66o,26515680,26521360,the carders directly they are not  involving any more rebels or any more
pBWp7sZG66o,26521360,26527040,mlas or anyone else they are talking to  the talking to the carders they are  talking to block provoked they are
pBWp7sZG66o,26527040,26532398,talking to the jalapeno they are talking  to the street uh shiv
pBWp7sZG66o,26532398,26538000,the ground worker and the kind of uproar  you are seeing it's taking an ugly turn
pBWp7sZG66o,26538000,26544840,now i don't know this may become a law  and order situation entire maharashtra  well the chief minister the chief
pBWp7sZG66o,26544840,26552240,minister uh as the administrator of the  state the state home minister part of  the ncp uh de la falca partel it's their
pBWp7sZG66o,26552240,26557280,responsibility to control it if they  want to if they will that remains to be
pBWp7sZG66o,26557280,26563120,seen uh but abhishek tripathi the bjp  stands accused of
pBWp7sZG66o,26563120,26569040,fermenting this trouble and leading the  shift cena uh to this crisis flying
pBWp7sZG66o,26569040,26574958,these mlas first uh to to taking them  first to surat and then to to gohati and
pBWp7sZG66o,26574958,26582000,now there is some  there are some reports uh that sanjay  out seems to think they will all be  flown to goa soon
pBWp7sZG66o,26582000,26587840,i don't understand gaurav i fail to  understand why are they accusing  bhartiya janta
pBWp7sZG66o,26587840,26592878,they lost a  rajya sabha election on 10th of june  they lost
pBWp7sZG66o,26592878,26599280,mlc election on 20th so they are they  can't take and they can't stand such  things especially in mumbai and
pBWp7sZG66o,26599280,26605280,maharashtra and see what's happening  today on the in the streets of mumbai  there's vandalism there's gundam-ism
pBWp7sZG66o,26605280,26611600,they're they're breaking things they're  putting up fires everywhere uh this is  the real shiv sena is what uh what uh
pBWp7sZG66o,26611600,26616958,honorable cm also also the chief of the  shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,26617520,26622958,he wants to claim to uh is is this is  how we see uh mr sanjay routh openly
pBWp7sZG66o,26622958,26628320,challenging and threatening uh the the  rebel mlas uh to come to mumbai if they
pBWp7sZG66o,26628320,26634478,have the guts too so this kind if  they've come to this kind of resort i  think this is highly unfortunate by by
pBWp7sZG66o,26634478,26640398,by the so-called ships why are you  centering them  you tell that also
pBWp7sZG66o,26640398,26646160,what  okay uh mr chandrasekhar of the ship  sena is asking you why are you
pBWp7sZG66o,26646160,26652320,sheltering our rebels why are you  sheltering shifts in our rebels see see  these kinds of accusations will go
pBWp7sZG66o,26652320,26658798,lifelong i don't understand where on  what basis  bjp is the single largest party in mind
pBWp7sZG66o,26658798,26664478,what about the what about the  announcements made by mr  mr  uh
pBWp7sZG66o,26664478,26671360,he is moving to delhi what what what  what bjp is doing let let also be all  those things become on record he can he
pBWp7sZG66o,26671360,26678160,can go to delhi he can meet the senior  leadership in delhi uh he is not  threatening anybody like mr sanjay rao
pBWp7sZG66o,26678160,26684160,he's not saying anybody to let these  people come to mumbai and then we'll see  them he's not doing something anything
pBWp7sZG66o,26684160,26689840,of that life he has a full authority his  axiom he is leader opposition he has all
pBWp7sZG66o,26689840,26696080,the right  this is the operation black lotus and  nothing else and this is this is these
pBWp7sZG66o,26696080,26700238,kinds of  the brain of mr
pBWp7sZG66o,26712000,26719440,that you may allege that this is will  not succeed if your house is in order  and the indication is your house is not
pBWp7sZG66o,26719440,26725120,in order that is why this is happening  and abhishektra party says whether it is

pBWp7sZG66o,26950558,26955760,legislative assembly narrative basically  sets the deadline of 27th of june 5 30
pBWp7sZG66o,26955760,26961840,p.m which basically states that this is  uh the request the plea the  disqualification plea that we've
pBWp7sZG66o,26961840,26967440,received from mr sunil prabhu who is the  whip of the shiva say now the udav takre
pBWp7sZG66o,26967440,26973600,led a faction of course  not a faction appointed  in his place but sunil prabhu's request
pBWp7sZG66o,26973600,26982798,is to disqualify this you are requested  to present your response your written  response by the 27th of june 5 30 p.m
pBWp7sZG66o,26982798,26989440,along with any sort of supporting  documents that you might want to in fact  uh in fact put forth before the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,26989440,26994718,speaker's office and if at all you do  not submit your response by the said
pBWp7sZG66o,26994718,27000478,deadline that it will be presumed that  you have nothing to say in response and  consequent action or decision by the
pBWp7sZG66o,27000478,27005920,deputy speaker's office on the plea  submitted by sunil prabhu will be taken
pBWp7sZG66o,27005920,27013680,and in about 30 minutes we will  officially hear from deepak sarkar uh on  the response uh of of the rebel faction
pBWp7sZG66o,27013680,27020958,uh but uh follow me since you've been  speaking to them at length what is their  strategy because the uddhav sena is
pBWp7sZG66o,27020958,27027040,mounting a multi-pronged  offensive uh apart from this notice that  has been sent apart from protests that
pBWp7sZG66o,27027040,27032558,we see on the streets uh you know mr  chandrasekhar of the ship saying is  already telling us that a group of ships
pBWp7sZG66o,27032558,27039840,ship senate leaders are standing by in  bengal they intend to reach gohati when  permitted reach out to these 38 rebels
pBWp7sZG66o,27039840,27043760,and get them back into the party fall  perhaps
pBWp7sZG66o,27046638,27052080,well like you said in 30 minutes from  now we will find out what exactly is the  eighth notch in the faction's standard
pBWp7sZG66o,27052080,27059200,visa we won this notice now it has been  issued uh of course it will uh arrive in  their email boxes shortly as well so
pBWp7sZG66o,27059200,27065600,they will be able to uh see those  responses and of course written copies  of the same hard copies of the same will
pBWp7sZG66o,27065600,27072398,go to their registered addresses in  maharashtra as well uh but of course  they have been strategizing about this
pBWp7sZG66o,27072398,27079520,already it was anticipated that the  deadline would be about 48 hours from  now which it is which is june 27th of 5
pBWp7sZG66o,27079520,27085040,30 p.m is the deadline which has been  said uh for the responses to come in it
pBWp7sZG66o,27085040,27091760,is expected that obviously all of these  mlas will send in their responses but it  remains to be seen whether of course the
pBWp7sZG66o,27091760,27097680,deputy speaker of the house finds that  satisfactory or not because already
pBWp7sZG66o,27097680,27104000,the live images of shiv cena uh supremo  and the maharashtra chief minister  uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,27104000,27111600,after the national executive meet  he's come out he's greeting his
pBWp7sZG66o,27111600,27117680,supporters there you see aditya  just behind  her
pBWp7sZG66o,27117680,27122798,is also taking pictures  of of the large number of shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,27122798,27129920,leaders workers and supporters outside  but there you see this is this is very  clearly a massive
pBWp7sZG66o,27129920,27137040,show of strength being put out uh by  takre  clearly a message uh
pBWp7sZG66o,27137040,27142718,ravi srivastav if i may a message that  uddaf is well truly in control of his
pBWp7sZG66o,27142718,27149638,party if even if he's lost control of  two third mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,27150958,27158558,i think uh that  what some uh sri sanik was just now  speaking over your uh uh channel that is
pBWp7sZG66o,27158558,27162798,synonyms there this  name is
pBWp7sZG66o,27165120,27170638,so i think that factor is very very  strong and anybody trying to claim or
pBWp7sZG66o,27170638,27177840,say something like you know bala sushena  or something like that is not going to  work and i think election commission is
pBWp7sZG66o,27177840,27183600,not going to take any cognizance of even  such requests i think without hakare is
pBWp7sZG66o,27183600,27190638,firmly in the chair and after this  disqualification notification i think  this will have a spine chilling effect
pBWp7sZG66o,27190638,27197122,on these uh mlas and uh we can hope that  they'll come back
pBWp7sZG66o,27197280,27202958,okay i also want to bring in  ncp seema malik joining us uh on the
pBWp7sZG66o,27202958,27210558,broadcast  ma'am it was being said that uh shahrukh  pavar has advised uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,27210558,27216638,to deal very strongly with the rebels is  that what you see happen is sharath
pBWp7sZG66o,27216638,27224240,power actually pulling the strings of  the mahavika sagari at one level and of  the shifts at the other
pBWp7sZG66o,27224240,27230398,yeah  yeah i'll say in my own world that  raised  this is the you know this is the talk
pBWp7sZG66o,27230398,27236478,between the two big leaders so i'm no  one authorized to say that what he has  said and what he has not said but uh but
pBWp7sZG66o,27236478,27243120,i know that uh my party is standing  formally with uh shiv cena and udati and
pBWp7sZG66o,27243120,27249120,we are going to you know fight  politically and legally just legally we  are dealing with all these things and
pBWp7sZG66o,27249120,27256320,this is the situation it's something  very unfortunate and as as  as somebody said before me i i can't see
pBWp7sZG66o,27256320,27262320,that that  really it is very difficult to imagine  uh you know a shift seminar with without
pBWp7sZG66o,27262320,27268398,hakis  and uh it is against uh i think well  said that  [Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,27268398,27275040,give me two seconds uh india today joins  me now with their okay
pBWp7sZG66o,27305120,27311760,so very very clearly and extremely  aggressive  out there you heard priyanka chaturvedi
pBWp7sZG66o,27311760,27317840,the deputy leader of the party in the  rajya sabha what is she saying priyanka  chaturvedi is saying
pBWp7sZG66o,27317840,27323520,we will fight we will teach them a  lesson of their life
pBWp7sZG66o,27323520,27331120,very very strong words abhishek tripati  the shiv sena is extremely aggressive on
pBWp7sZG66o,27331120,27337042,day four  on these rebels perhaps even their  supporters
pBWp7sZG66o,27337280,27343360,this is what we are getting to see  gaurav threatening from every quarter  every leader of shivsina is threatening
pBWp7sZG66o,27343360,27348798,and openly threatening we just got to  know this section 144 imposed in mumbai
pBWp7sZG66o,27348798,27354878,and thani and this is happening because  of the shift signings of the government  shift signings of udav takari so this is
pBWp7sZG66o,27354878,27360080,highly unfortunate it is unsafe to  travel in mumbai right now and and
pBWp7sZG66o,27360080,27367600,around areas and around around the  cities of mumbai so this is this is not  done uh uh i don't know uh where will
pBWp7sZG66o,27367600,27374718,this lead to because the situation is  not really good and this is not a way to  deal with something this is illegal that
pBWp7sZG66o,27374718,27380878,you have  gone for a disqualification of  16 rebel mlas but
pBWp7sZG66o,27380878,27386958,make sure  they will go to the court and and this  will be a legal battle very soon
pBWp7sZG66o,27386958,27392240,a battle that will be fought in courts  and on streets is what sanjay routh had
pBWp7sZG66o,27392240,27398718,said but uh uh  sheikha ji is that what is happening you  heard priyanka chaturvedi we will fight
pBWp7sZG66o,27398718,27403602,we will teach them a lesson of their  life nam
pBWp7sZG66o,27404638,27410878,okay let's once again cut across to  moshmi singh speaking to priyanka  chaturvedi
pBWp7sZG66o,27413600,27420080,all right gaurav priyanka we are joined  by priyanka chaturvedi and we'll try and  understand uh what is the action that
pBWp7sZG66o,27420080,27427520,has been uh preceded in this entire  meeting we are told that uh action was  proceed done against the rebel we have
pBWp7sZG66o,27427520,27434878,taken unanimous decision that shivsena  will work under the leadership of bala  sahib thakri and whatever he deems fit
pBWp7sZG66o,27434878,27441360,in terms of action in terms of reaction  in terms of legalities in terms of  technicalities in terms of politically
pBWp7sZG66o,27441360,27446398,we all stand firmly behind him  uh this comes at a time when the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,27446398,27451440,speaker has summoned ekna cindy that he  cannot take a call he should come here
pBWp7sZG66o,27451440,27456718,and speak to the deputy speaker and on  the other hand continuously shift sena
pBWp7sZG66o,27456718,27462558,leaders are issuing warnings to the  rebel camp is it right that the way the  the law and order situation is
pBWp7sZG66o,27462558,27467600,deteriorating how is law and order  situation getting  messed up in the city are you feeling
pBWp7sZG66o,27467600,27473040,unsafe in the city  am i not roaming easily in the city who  are those who are feeling unsafe there
pBWp7sZG66o,27473040,27479120,are those who have i'll tell you those  those who have gone against the mandate  of the people gone against the symbol
pBWp7sZG66o,27479120,27485440,that they have voted uh into and into  power are the ones people are angry  towards so let be rest assured mumbai's
pBWp7sZG66o,27485440,27490958,law and order is absolutely in control  we have a good police commissioner who's  handling it  not shinde saying that we are the real
pBWp7sZG66o,27490958,27499398,shifts  sena is the shinde sin it's such a joke  it's such a joke
pBWp7sZG66o,27503440,27509280,okay give me a moment as i try to  re-establish that link an extremely  combative priyanka chaturvedi there
pBWp7sZG66o,27509280,27517040,priyanka chaturvedhi says and mark those  words very carefully she said
pBWp7sZG66o,27517840,27524798,under  his leadership under his directions the  party will work they stand firmly under
pBWp7sZG66o,27524798,27530080,his leadership and whatever legal  administrative uh decisions he takes
pBWp7sZG66o,27530080,27535680,there will be followed who's feeling  unsafe in mumbai only those who went
pBWp7sZG66o,27535680,27541440,against the mandate and the symbol under  which they were elected it's a joke she
pBWp7sZG66o,27541440,27546478,says that  ignacion or the rebel cena claims that
pBWp7sZG66o,27546478,27552958,they are the real shift cena bala sahib  so very very combative uh shift sena we
pBWp7sZG66o,27552958,27561760,notice here um  but mr chandrashekhar  this combative attitude uh here versus
pBWp7sZG66o,27561760,27569600,facts on ground in courts of law  that remains the big battle sir two  thirds of your mlas still remain in in

pBWp7sZG66o,28086798,28094398,name for political use  sanjay rao shiv sena member of  parliament clearly clearly
pBWp7sZG66o,28094398,28101360,giving details of the six resolutions  that have been passed and uddaf
pBWp7sZG66o,28101440,28107440,said  if you want to use  a name for political advantage for
pBWp7sZG66o,28107440,28113200,political gains use your own father's  name not balasad parker's name
pBWp7sZG66o,28113200,28120000,a clear signal of the hardening stance  against the 38 shifts in our rebel mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,28120000,28128240,currently in gohati  it's  15 49 hours at this point of time 3 49
pBWp7sZG66o,28128240,28135040,and india today gives you the details of  the six resolutions that have been  passed at the national executive of the
pBWp7sZG66o,28135040,28142958,shift cena at the shifts in  in mumbai and i quickly want to cut  across 2500 kilometers uh from there to
pBWp7sZG66o,28142958,28148160,gohati where palamy saha now joins me  for more so follow me 10 minutes from
pBWp7sZG66o,28148160,28154638,now we will hear from the rebels but  this clearly is a hardening of stance of
pBWp7sZG66o,28154638,28157042,the shiv
pBWp7sZG66o,28161840,28165360,strongest action against them
pBWp7sZG66o,28167440,28172798,absolutely this is a massive hardening  of stance by the ship saying after the  national executive meeting would have
pBWp7sZG66o,28172798,28179122,taken the big statement coming out from  the national executive  saying
pBWp7sZG66o,28181760,28188080,so clearly sahib's name is not for them  to use sir bala sahib's name will stay
pBWp7sZG66o,28188080,28194958,with the shiva cena this after the rebel  faction in fact suggested that they  could be calling their group shiva sena
pBWp7sZG66o,28194958,28200398,bala sahib they are saying that if  anyone misuses that name legal action
pBWp7sZG66o,28200398,28207680,will be taken bala sahib and the takari  family name and the shiv sena name  belongs to the ut
pBWp7sZG66o,28207680,28213600,led shiv sena in a few moments from now  we will of course get a reaction from  the rebel camp as well as deepak sarkar
pBWp7sZG66o,28213600,28218878,addresses uh that press conference over  a video link but clearly a hardening of
pBWp7sZG66o,28218878,28223920,stance uh by the shiv cena so here it is  the ship saying already taking to the
pBWp7sZG66o,28223920,28230718,streets uh agitating protesting against  these rebel mla is now saying that we  will take legal action against anyone
pBWp7sZG66o,28230718,28236638,that decides or chooses to use the name  of bala sahib and also those notices
pBWp7sZG66o,28236638,28244080,which have been sent to the 16 rebel  mlas from the deputy speakers office  saying send us in your written responses
pBWp7sZG66o,28244080,28251360,to this disqualification plea that is  coming from the udav takari led shiv  sena by june 27 5 30 pm and if you do
pBWp7sZG66o,28251360,28257440,not respond we will consider you have  nothing to say and we will take  consequent action accordingly and as per
pBWp7sZG66o,28257440,28263040,procedure so clearly a gerald of sorts  of which the ship cena down but not out
pBWp7sZG66o,28263040,28268320,is trying to in fact do of the rebel  camp which is in fact cloistered inside

pBWp7sZG66o,28339520,28345600,do you litter well humans do have a  habit of littering possibly everywhere  but here's something that will shock you
pBWp7sZG66o,28345600,28350638,human thrash was found on mars yes we  aren't kidding nasa's perseverance rover
pBWp7sZG66o,28350638,28357920,is on a mission to explore mars planet  and while exploring it found a piece of  human thrash
pBWp7sZG66o,28359840,28366798,nasa shared images on twitter where it  can be clearly seen that a shiny litter  is stuck between the rocks it was indeed
pBWp7sZG66o,28366798,28373920,a surprise to find it in that region so  far the perseverance rover had no luck  in finding life on mars planet but thus
pBWp7sZG66o,28373920,28381280,finding this piece of thrash really  means something  the rover actually stumbled on a piece  of thermal blanket which nasa thinks
pBWp7sZG66o,28381280,28387600,might have come from the rover's descent  stage the thermal blanket protects the  rover from extreme temperatures it is
pBWp7sZG66o,28387600,28393840,possible that the thermal blanket  belongs to the rover's descent stage but  what nasa finds out is that the descent
pBWp7sZG66o,28393840,28399600,crashed two kilometers away from the  location so how did that piece of  thermal blanket get there
pBWp7sZG66o,28399600,28405440,the perseverance team thought that it  could have been blown away from the wind  nasa's perseverance rover was sent to
pBWp7sZG66o,28405440,28413040,explore the red planet to find ancient  signs of living it landed on mars in  2021 and since then has been collecting

pBWp7sZG66o,28458878,28464160,have you noticed a mouse lurking in your  house  or eating something from your kitchen
pBWp7sZG66o,28464160,28469920,it's so tempting to catch them but these  are evasive creatures  what you're going to hear next will
pBWp7sZG66o,28469920,28476958,drive you bananas  scientists recently made a strange  discovery the smell of bananas terrified
pBWp7sZG66o,28476958,28485200,male mice yes you heard that right the  solution to your problems was lying  under your nose all this one
pBWp7sZG66o,28486718,28493040,scientists were starting the reaction of  male mice to pregnant and lactating  female mice when they unintentionally
pBWp7sZG66o,28493040,28499040,stumbled upon this fact  researchers from mcgill university found  that the scent of bananas creates a
pBWp7sZG66o,28499040,28505520,stress response in the male mice  they also found that pregnant and  lactating female mice responded to
pBWp7sZG66o,28505520,28512000,stranger male mice with aggression and  urine marking  the main mice began acting weird around
pBWp7sZG66o,28512000,28518798,the pregnant female mice in the lab it  was because the female mice used chemo  signaling or the scent of their urine to
pBWp7sZG66o,28518798,28524000,protect the children from predators and  infanticide by male mice and strangely
pBWp7sZG66o,28524000,28529360,enough the compound found in the male  mice's urine and penityl acetate is the
pBWp7sZG66o,28529360,28535840,same one that gives bananas its  distinctive  smell rodents and a lot of mammals other
pBWp7sZG66o,28535840,28541600,than humans are reliant on their  olfactory senses  while olfactory messages are commonly
pBWp7sZG66o,28541600,28546840,sent from males to females there are  fewer examples of females sending them  to
pBWp7sZG66o,28546840,28552080,males so as it goes in the science world  they had to test this theory out
pBWp7sZG66o,28552080,28558958,scientists bought banana oil from a  local supermarket and put it inside the  cages the stress levels of the male mice
pBWp7sZG66o,28558958,28564000,then increased significantly the study  also found that virgin male mice were
pBWp7sZG66o,28564000,28571360,more likely to be stressed out by the  presence of end penetral acetate whether  in bananas or mouse urine so it turns

pBWp7sZG66o,29597360,29604398,rebel mla has to say deepak sarkar  remembers one of the senior faces of the  senate he's now in guwahati taking all
pBWp7sZG66o,29604398,29609760,the questions there uh initially the  question is being taken and he's spoken  in marathi now i go across to my
pBWp7sZG66o,29609760,29615440,colleague sutar on this  very interesting how deepak is in these
pBWp7sZG66o,29615440,29621360,mlas are taking all questions  interacting with the media persons and  still very confident of their numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,29621360,29626680,what did he say just now if you can help  translate for us
pBWp7sZG66o,29627360,29633120,three important points uh uh the first  point being that we have not quit the  party we are still with the cena that is
pBWp7sZG66o,29633120,29638878,the first important point second point  that he raised that we have certain  constitutional rights uh we are
pBWp7sZG66o,29638878,29645200,whatever  actions we are taking as are as per the
pBWp7sZG66o,29645200,29651520,constitutional rights provided to  elected members it's the elected members  that uh elect  the office buyers in the assembly we're
pBWp7sZG66o,29651520,29657040,just using that the picture that you are  being shown is different from what the  reality is that is the third important
pBWp7sZG66o,29657040,29662398,point that he made in the press  conference uh and uh he also made an  appeal to chief sena and chieftain of
pBWp7sZG66o,29662398,29667440,workers that you should not get to the  streets the kind of protest and the kind  of violence and arson that they're
pBWp7sZG66o,29667440,29674080,witnessing in maharashtra uh he said  that it's wrong chief cynics should not  take to the streets and uh protest uh
pBWp7sZG66o,29674080,29680240,three important points at this point uh  uh he is one of the
pBWp7sZG66o,29680240,29686398,important faces uh from the  shinde camp he is an mla from the konkan
pBWp7sZG66o,29686398,29693120,region from district and uh being the  former uh uh minister of minister of  state for home during the event of a
pBWp7sZG66o,29693120,29698958,noise cabinet he uh spoke to india today  earlier and he said that uh  he has been of the opinion that shifts
pBWp7sZG66o,29698958,29705360,in and bjp should tie up and now deepak  are addressing that press conference  after that an all-important meeting of
pBWp7sZG66o,29705360,29712240,the rebel camp that took place in  kuwaiti just a while before we seen the  visuals of that meeting on uh india
pBWp7sZG66o,29712240,29718160,today just a while before and deepak are  now telling uh uh the media is  addressing a press conference this is
pBWp7sZG66o,29718160,29723200,perhaps the first press conference uh  addressed by uh the shinde camp from
pBWp7sZG66o,29723200,29728798,guwahati uh they are taking questions  from the media interacting with the  media uh and deeper cases and making
pBWp7sZG66o,29728798,29735600,some important points so uh he also  mentioned another important point that  we uh have approached with the
pBWp7sZG66o,29735600,29741840,with this we have  gone to the  with the issues that the mlas are facing
pBWp7sZG66o,29741840,29748478,and he also made a point that if uh such  a large number of mlas are making one  point then it means that there is
pBWp7sZG66o,29748478,29755840,certain uh there is a substance uh to  the issue raised by that but our uh  fight wasn't hurt that is what the [ __ ]
pBWp7sZG66o,29755840,29761920,is saying and all the important press  conference he's making a point on one  hand we've seen shifts
pBWp7sZG66o,29761920,29767280,eventually it will come down to as it is  starting to about the bala sahiba legacy
pBWp7sZG66o,29767280,29772718,uh why do you think precisely now k  sarkar is even willing to take all  questions literally a press conference
pBWp7sZG66o,29772718,29779280,virtually uh is this also about how  after udav takre uh got a show of  strength of his whether it's national
pBWp7sZG66o,29779280,29784878,executive or the shift centrics on the  streets aknac in this groups is also  interacting and stating they are very
pBWp7sZG66o,29784878,29791760,confident what are you picking up on the  bala sahib name issue that is now  cropping up about the group of aknachin
pBWp7sZG66o,29791760,29795160,they taking that
pBWp7sZG66o,29800318,29806878,approaching the election commission uh  barring the  the  rebel group of aikma cindy from using
pBWp7sZG66o,29806878,29809042,the
pBWp7sZG66o,29818318,29824958,are they going to go to the court  regarding that they would they're also  thinking on that line so this is going  to be a legal battle what deeper
pBWp7sZG66o,29824958,29830000,mentioned in his press conference before  he said that we are being threatened  with notices we have seen just a while
pBWp7sZG66o,29830000,29837120,before uh rebel mla is being slapped  with notices they've been asked to  ask to put forth their side of story
pBWp7sZG66o,29837120,29842638,till monday 5 30 p.m that is another  important point that he tries to raise  here in his press conference the deeper
pBWp7sZG66o,29842638,29849360,cases are saying that we've been  threatened with notices another  important point that he made is that the  situation on the ground is different the
pBWp7sZG66o,29849360,29854638,reality is different than what is being  portrayed the way shift clinics have  taken to the streets the way we are  witnessing violence all across
pBWp7sZG66o,29854638,29860080,maharashtra he's trying to clarify that  uh uh the  camp for the first time is interacting
pBWp7sZG66o,29860080,29865120,with the media taking all questions from  the media and trying to put
pBWp7sZG66o,29869600,29875280,a message there don't come out on the  streets because you don't know the  reality the reality is not what is being
pBWp7sZG66o,29875280,29882240,told to you  well exactly exactly that is what uh  these are trying to now put the kind of
pBWp7sZG66o,29882240,29889200,political narrative that they're  witnessing in maharashtra uh pooja  is trying to portray a picture of
pBWp7sZG66o,29889200,29894798,victoria somebody has betrayed the party  uh even look at the tone and tenor of  the factory speech
pBWp7sZG66o,29894798,29900240,he is calling them victorious those who  have backstabbed the party uh he is  trying to create a picture and that is
pBWp7sZG66o,29900240,29905520,where he is suddenly getting onto the  streets offices of the rebel camp are  being vandalized you've seen vandalism
pBWp7sZG66o,29905520,29910878,in different parts of maharashtra  especially uh top leaders of rebels are  facing that vandalism their offices have
pBWp7sZG66o,29910878,29916478,been targeted uh that is why repo  is appealing to ships in our workers not  to take to seats because the picture
pBWp7sZG66o,29916478,29921920,that they know is different  trying somewhere  create a picture uh that the rebellion
pBWp7sZG66o,29921920,29928798,is against the party it is just about  the legislative party that is what  deepak  was trying to tell as the legislative
pBWp7sZG66o,29928798,29934318,party we have certain constitutional  rights that have been given to us uh  that is uh that is what we are trying to
pBWp7sZG66o,29934318,29941280,use it is about that it is not about  israel he's trying to say that in as uh  as few words as possible but appearing
pBWp7sZG66o,29941280,29947120,to shift in our workers not to take to  the streets because the reality is  different  also at this point as he's taking
pBWp7sZG66o,29947120,29953520,questions uh he's very clearly said we  have two third majority we got elected  on shiv sena's ticket but he's also very
pBWp7sZG66o,29953520,29958878,clearly saying that we are the bala  sahib's ideology we will never betray
pBWp7sZG66o,29958878,29964080,the party so the protests that are  happening on the ground do you think  that has also become a concern now for
pBWp7sZG66o,29964080,29969920,the rebel group  uh well indeed uh we've seen what uddhav  said just a while before wylie addressed
pBWp7sZG66o,29969920,29975120,the national uh executive meeting of  cena what uh udav takara said that you
pBWp7sZG66o,29975120,29981440,should not use the name of balasab you  should not use the name of shivrina in  your group if you want you can use your
pBWp7sZG66o,29981440,29987040,father's name but not my father's name  that is what uh  in very clear words with the fact they
pBWp7sZG66o,29987040,29992080,made it clear to the rebel camp if you  want to use the word of shiva you should  be with the chieftain also having said
pBWp7sZG66o,29992080,29998718,that pooja would i also like to add that  uh face uh has kept the window of her  approach ma open for the rebels he said
pBWp7sZG66o,29998718,30005360,those world cup those who want to come  back uh would be uh  those are still open that your friends  are outside but uh
pBWp7sZG66o,30005360,30011200,national executive committee uh meeting  not taking any action against the rebel  camp certainly shows that the window
pBWp7sZG66o,30011200,30017600,over approach might still open if they  want to come back at least  that could be considered because a  strict action has been avoided by the
pBWp7sZG66o,30017600,30023360,national executive although all rights  have been conferred upon  he can take any uh action on behalf of
pBWp7sZG66o,30023360,30029360,the national executive so that is what  uh on one hand we are saying but on the  other hand chief signings are largely uh
pBWp7sZG66o,30029360,30035280,protesting on the roads it is not just  in mumbai uh we saw protest in mumbai  vandalism in mumbai today uh the fire is
pBWp7sZG66o,30035280,30040318,spreading in  pune  and other parts of maharashtra really

pBWp7sZG66o,30349120,30356958,you know kim taehyung aka v of pop group  bts fame well he's simultaneously 26 27
pBWp7sZG66o,30356958,30363200,and 28 years old confused  how old were you when you were born zero
pBWp7sZG66o,30363200,30369840,one  in south korea you'd be one year old  let's clear the air about this
pBWp7sZG66o,30372478,30379120,south korea has a unique way of  calculating age when a baby is born it's  considered a year old and as the year
pBWp7sZG66o,30379120,30384798,changes on january 1st the child gains a  year so no special birthdays south
pBWp7sZG66o,30384798,30392080,koreans can't age based on their birth  year and not days a child born in  december will already be two by january
pBWp7sZG66o,30392080,30399280,but the president-elect yoon sukyol  wants to do away with this traditional  system because of persistent confusion
pBWp7sZG66o,30399280,30406558,and unnecessary social and economic  costs the incoming administration is  looking to standardize age calculation
pBWp7sZG66o,30406558,30412958,this was observed especially when health  authorities use the international age  and korean ages interchangeably to set
pBWp7sZG66o,30412958,30420398,guidelines for kobit 19. this will also  help south korea get in line with the  rest of the world
pBWp7sZG66o,30422398,30429440,the age conundrum doesn't end here south  korea also counts age in an  international way that means it counts
pBWp7sZG66o,30429440,30435840,age in three ways for legal and  administrative purposes the country has  been using the international accounting
pBWp7sZG66o,30435840,30441280,system since 1962.  in another way babies are born at zero
pBWp7sZG66o,30441280,30448080,and gain a year or new years this method  is mainly used to define the legal age  for areas of law that affect a
pBWp7sZG66o,30448080,30453280,significant percentage of the population  including military service conscription
pBWp7sZG66o,30453280,30459680,and the third is the korean age system  where everyone is already a year old at  birth and become older on new year's day
pBWp7sZG66o,30459680,30468318,regardless of the birth date that's how  kim taehyung from bts fame is  simultaneously 26 27 and 28 years old as
pBWp7sZG66o,30468318,30473240,he was born on 30th december 1995.
pBWp7sZG66o,30475360,30481280,there are multiple problems that arise  with age discrepancies it's led to wage  disputes that have been dragged to the
pBWp7sZG66o,30481280,30488000,supreme court and ruled that workers  should consider their international age  for work  there have also been cases of parents
pBWp7sZG66o,30488000,30493520,trying to cheat the birth registration  system because of worries that their  children born in december will be at a
pBWp7sZG66o,30493520,30500080,disadvantage at school as a result later  in life  efforts were made in 2019 and 2021 to
pBWp7sZG66o,30500080,30505760,change the law two lawmakers proposed  legislation to adhere to the  international age but experts are
pBWp7sZG66o,30505760,30512320,divided to what the new measure means  for korean society and the bills were  not signed into law

pBWp7sZG66o,30948398,30954478,uh today in the turn of events we saw uh  that notices also have been issued by
pBWp7sZG66o,30954478,30961680,deputy secretary to 16 rebellious susana  mlas uh though the two independent mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,30961680,30967920,yesterday had uh given a proposal that a  deputy speaker cannot disqualify any of
pBWp7sZG66o,30967920,30973280,the mlas because no confidence motion  has been moved against him but uh in the
pBWp7sZG66o,30973280,30979920,early uh earlier first half of the day  we also saw that a deputy speaker has
pBWp7sZG66o,30979920,30985200,rejected the same proposal because it  was sent by some random email and now
pBWp7sZG66o,30985200,30990558,the news is coming in which which is we  are breaking on india today that today a
pBWp7sZG66o,30990558,30996798,physical proposal has also been  submitted by mlas the independent mlas
pBWp7sZG66o,30996798,31002318,no confidence motion has been physically  submitted to the deputy speaker office
pBWp7sZG66o,31002318,31009520,here in vidhan bhavan mumbai so we have  to see that how does this  disqualification uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31009520,31014798,process also moves forward let's go  across now to go hearty palamy saha been
pBWp7sZG66o,31014798,31020160,tracking all the latest on that uh  follow me clearly today with deepak  sarkar and the ignacinde group also
pBWp7sZG66o,31020160,31025280,turning on an aggressive stand  interacting taking questions what do you  think is the messaging that the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,31025280,31032240,emilies are trying to put forth and  telling the ship's cenix you don't know  the reality don't come out on the  streets
pBWp7sZG66o,31035040,31040958,well basically the message that they're  trying to send out is that there is a  lot or that uh you know
pBWp7sZG66o,31040958,31047280,as far as what the uh what meets the eye  really as far as what is playing out on  uh uh on the face of it and what's
pBWp7sZG66o,31047280,31052718,playing out uh behind they've of course  uh asked the shift sonics to not come  out on the streets because they're
pBWp7sZG66o,31052718,31058958,telling them that you don't know the  reality there is a lot that's going on  we've not been we've not either hijacked
pBWp7sZG66o,31058958,31066398,the shiva sena or uh you know uh in fact  betrayed its ideology we're still very  much a part of the shiva sena it's just
pBWp7sZG66o,31066398,31072798,that our sentiments are different we do  not believe that the shiv cena should be  a part of the mahabika sagari uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31072798,31079840,government we believe that the ncp has  tried to destroy the shiva sena it has  been a calculated strategy of the ncp to
pBWp7sZG66o,31079840,31085840,destroy the ship saying it is the ncp  which is trying to hijack the party and  we the two thirds uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31085840,31092638,the two third members or for the  legislative party of the shiv cena  believe that we have the numbers in  order to go ahead and make our
pBWp7sZG66o,31092638,31097920,sentiments known to everyone we're not  in any sense betraying anybody as far as
pBWp7sZG66o,31097920,31103280,the disqualification notices are  concerned and the summons that have gone  out to 16 rebel mlas what they're saying
pBWp7sZG66o,31103280,31109360,is that of course the you know it has  just come to us we have just two days  now before the deadline comes to an end
pBWp7sZG66o,31109360,31115600,on monday at 5 30  pm but the fact is that we will of  course study that and as far as the the
pBWp7sZG66o,31115600,31121600,speaker's move is concerned to of course  and we will submit our responses is what  mr deeper kisser said in that press
pBWp7sZG66o,31121600,31127440,conference but as far as the speakers  move is concerned to remove mr iknow as  the leader of the legislative party is
pBWp7sZG66o,31127440,31133440,concerned they said categorically that  that is the decision which will be  challenged in court because we have two
pBWp7sZG66o,31133440,31140240,third members over here that is the  number we have so 16 or 17 mlas who sat  down one day and decided to in fact
pBWp7sZG66o,31140240,31146878,remove mr eknath shinde of the position  of leader of the legislative but he  can't do so because the numbers are with
pBWp7sZG66o,31146878,31153280,us right now maximum of them are here so  how is the minority group taking a  decision follow me stay on with me
pBWp7sZG66o,31153280,31160716,because it's the chev cena bhavan where  vidya can we say today after at least  three days that both
pBWp7sZG66o,31163040,31167638,again coming forth speaking up in  aggressive
pBWp7sZG66o,31201520,31208638,all right so that's  also minister in the government  walking out appears to be interacting uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31208638,31214080,not really taking questions as of now  but where is he heading very interesting  at this point because remember there's
pBWp7sZG66o,31214080,31220558,also a national executive meeting that  did take place today  unlike udav who had an emotional message
pBWp7sZG66o,31220558,31228000,of smiling again after three days as  well from the first day of the ensuring  that he comes across as a confident uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31228000,31235120,young takri minister in the government  and as shiv sena stands today despite  possibly facing a decimation of this
pBWp7sZG66o,31235120,31241520,camp uh fist thumping acknowledging  supporters ensuring that he comes across
pBWp7sZG66o,31241520,31246878,as a confident smiling young targaryen  on the other side saying i have been
pBWp7sZG66o,31246878,31253680,facing ill health this has been a  betrayal that we have faced and  absolutely emotional uh uh messages that
pBWp7sZG66o,31253680,31258958,he put out for the shifts nx and also  for the mlas but of course as you can  see
pBWp7sZG66o,31258958,31265440,constant calling communication  strategies interactions permutation  combinations by the target group right
pBWp7sZG66o,31265440,31272280,now  and a lovely visual there  goes in the reflection of the vehicle
pBWp7sZG66o,31272280,31278878,is banner  many would be wondering how baltacry  would have managed today's coup and
pBWp7sZG66o,31278878,31285360,rebellion as it unfolds so aditya talked  to not really reacting at this point
pBWp7sZG66o,31285360,31293360,but we can see that despite everything  he has been acknowledging and talking to  the supporters who are right outside
pBWp7sZG66o,31293360,31300798,uh the the matoshiri residence and at  this point also interacting with the  media persons as much as both the father
pBWp7sZG66o,31300798,31307200,and the son possibly can that aditya  leaving uh from the venue we'll try and
pBWp7sZG66o,31307200,31313360,get further information from my  colleague vidya who's on the ground with  there if you can hear me  would it be correct to say that after
pBWp7sZG66o,31313360,31319920,three days of sudden shock that appears  to have fallen on the tatari family udav  takre sanjay rao
pBWp7sZG66o,31319920,31326798,coming across slightly more aggressive  in their tone slightly more confident  that they uh with regard to the cenax
pBWp7sZG66o,31326798,31333958,violence on the ground with  disqualification plea all of that they  are strategizing
pBWp7sZG66o,31340558,31345840,all right and i also correct myself  there that uh  left from the shifts in
pBWp7sZG66o,31345840,31351120,just about few minutes ago not the  matoshri which is the ancestral  residence of the taqrei family but what
pBWp7sZG66o,31351120,31354878,you clearly see today take a look at  this
pBWp7sZG66o,31357760,31364240,three days on after surviving the  initial shock putting for the  disqualification plea to the deputy
pBWp7sZG66o,31364240,31372920,speaker  also stating that uh you know we will  respond if required by the anger of  shifts and it's understandable
pBWp7sZG66o,31389040,31394240,gohan  follow me because you also understand  maharashtra politics very closely uh if
pBWp7sZG66o,31394240,31400958,you could hear what aditya thakuray said  if you could translate but uh you know  the disqualification plea as rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,31400958,31407520,emilies are saying you cannot give it  for a party meeting it can only for uh  be assembly proceedings and therefore it
pBWp7sZG66o,31407520,31412638,is not valid if the deputy speaker has  given us a notice on the  disqualification plea but meanwhile as
pBWp7sZG66o,31412638,31419760,you can see today it's not that the tac  rays are cooped up in their house or  in their offices despite leaving from
pBWp7sZG66o,31419760,31425920,varsha the official chief minister's  residence to matoshri they are going in  and about ensuring that they interact
pBWp7sZG66o,31425920,31432080,whether it's the national executive  whether it's uh speaking and interacting  with the shift senate still talking and
pBWp7sZG66o,31432080,31438878,appealing and urging the rebel mlas to  return  we are very calm faced there
pBWp7sZG66o,31438878,31444000,acknowledging the reporters and the  party supporters who are there right  outside either the shiv cena or the
pBWp7sZG66o,31444000,31450042,matostri but he's headed out lightly  heading back to the residences

pBWp7sZG66o,31484558,31490878,ah very clearly saying yes  so making it of course a moral fight
pBWp7sZG66o,31490878,31496000,that this tak ray family is with the  right while they are with the untruth
pBWp7sZG66o,31496000,31503040,the rebel mla is led by ignacion they  let's go across quickly to goharty  palamisah joining all the latest follow  me so rebel emily is saying you cannot
pBWp7sZG66o,31503040,31510160,give us a disqualification notice  because it's only for assembly  proceedings not for a party meeting but  other titan here right now just saying
pBWp7sZG66o,31510160,31515920,that uh this is satya or asap  i am also joined by masumi because  mossman is in mumbai tracking all the
pBWp7sZG66o,31515920,31522558,latest from the chefs and our natas  so you've been speaking to  priyanka chaturvedi who says where's the
pBWp7sZG66o,31522558,31528398,law and order aditya chris says this is  about truth and untruth the fight that
pBWp7sZG66o,31528398,31533540,we are fighting and of course claiming  we are with the sutter here was me
pBWp7sZG66o,31533540,31539840,[Music]  absolutely you know sanjay rout did
pBWp7sZG66o,31539840,31545280,indicate pooja how the  that aditya takre was the future of
pBWp7sZG66o,31545280,31550878,shibsena so this is also a legacy war uh  even as uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,31550878,31556318,reiterated it that  this was a party of his father and if
pBWp7sZG66o,31556318,31563040,not they wanted to lay claim  then he should actually talk about  laying claim to his father's name not
pBWp7sZG66o,31563040,31570000,not bala  so clearly  a legacy war  to reclaim the legacy of bala takra has
pBWp7sZG66o,31570000,31575360,also broken out and added the takrya a  very important element in that entire
pBWp7sZG66o,31575360,31580638,claim because somewhere in the picture  as far as the  functioning of the shift sena is
pBWp7sZG66o,31580638,31586080,concerned as far as making him an office  whereas concerned there was uh there was
pBWp7sZG66o,31586080,31591200,a lot of um  uh dissension over uh aditya thakura's
pBWp7sZG66o,31591200,31600160,role with the old guard uh you know not  having a great rapport with him correct  yes really here but uh utah has
pBWp7sZG66o,31600160,31607360,as far as uh you know uh coming to the  ship cena bhavan is concerned after he  left russia really sending across a
pBWp7sZG66o,31607360,31612398,message that he uh has full control over  the shifts and how much that works on
pBWp7sZG66o,31612398,31618958,the ground we have to still see puja  mosby when today aditya chris says this  is a fight between truth and falsehood
pBWp7sZG66o,31618958,31625200,do you see and can we say here that  after three days of initial shock the  tark rays or even the camp that stands
pBWp7sZG66o,31625200,31631680,with  right now have become slightly more  aggressive  compared to how ekna chinde was more  confident earlier
pBWp7sZG66o,31631680,31639958,this remaining group has also ensured  they come out with strong statements and  do not look meek today
pBWp7sZG66o,31642958,31648398,oh absolutely pooja there has been a  shift of start uh strategy uh change in
pBWp7sZG66o,31648398,31654798,optics uh change in the rhetoric change  in the slogans uh  it is a completely
pBWp7sZG66o,31654798,31661440,different stand that the ship sena uh  sena um had taken uh two days back when
pBWp7sZG66o,31661440,31670398,he uh ud  actually drove out of russia so clearly  this is more uh of a combative
pBWp7sZG66o,31673680,31679920,functioning on ground zero from priyanka  chaturvedi uh to uh the sunday route all
pBWp7sZG66o,31679920,31685920,these leaders and even anil desai i  spoke to all these leaders were saying  these are just the emotions of ships
pBWp7sZG66o,31685920,31693840,annex that you see on display as far as  the violence or the vandalism is  concerned so really i think that now
pBWp7sZG66o,31693840,31701680,this battle is being fought on the  ground the battle lines are drawn and in  the days ahead uh these will will be
pBWp7sZG66o,31701680,31708478,anxious times for the maharashtra  politics masumi what exactly are the  cena neethas speaking to you are saying
pBWp7sZG66o,31708478,31714718,now you spoke to sanjay rao you spoke to  priyanka chaturvedi  traitors will not be tolerated they may
pBWp7sZG66o,31714718,31719602,not have the numbers they still have a  lot of confidence
pBWp7sZG66o,31722798,31728798,puja many do believe that you know uh  perhaps uh the uddhav could have spoken
pBWp7sZG66o,31728798,31733920,more aggressively yesterday could have  been more stern yesterday remember his
pBWp7sZG66o,31733920,31739200,two speeches have been very emotive and  uh and now after playing the emotional
pBWp7sZG66o,31739200,31745280,card this is uh you know a direct  confrontation a shift in strategy uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31745280,31750558,from you know a wait and watch approach  uh to a confrontational combative
pBWp7sZG66o,31750558,31758080,approach of the udav senate so clearly  with ignacion they're actually taking  the lead as far as uh the attacks are
pBWp7sZG66o,31758080,31766398,concerned the claims are concerned in  the initial leg of this uh maharashtra  political war uh now the this leg uh
pBWp7sZG66o,31766398,31771760,hugely and uh  majorly belongs to the udav sena that is
pBWp7sZG66o,31771760,31778240,uh throwing one card after the other  making public statements now it it is
pBWp7sZG66o,31778240,31783360,almost certain that the bridges have  been burnt and these are issue threats
pBWp7sZG66o,31783360,31789040,that are being issued which are having a  direct impact on ground zero whether it
pBWp7sZG66o,31789040,31794080,is kurla or you saw how  an office was vandalized of a local sat
pBWp7sZG66o,31794080,31799280,trap mla from in pune so really uh we  will have to wait and watch how this

pBWp7sZG66o,31905360,31910958,u.s saw raging incidents of gun violence  the measure would toughen background
pBWp7sZG66o,31910958,31919318,checks for youngest gun buyers and keep  firearms away from more domestic  violence offenders
pBWp7sZG66o,31922160,31927360,the bipartisan bill was easily approved  by the senate given the frequency of gun
pBWp7sZG66o,31927360,31934318,violence in the u.s the measure would  toughen background checks for the  youngest gun buyers 15 billion dollars

pBWp7sZG66o,31981120,31987360,which may prove to be a setback for  stricter gun control the law in new york  required people to show a specific
pBWp7sZG66o,31987360,31994558,reason for carrying a gun they can carry  only if they prove a particular reason  then people receive a license to carry a

pBWp7sZG66o,32776480,32783122,assam in guwahati but now our colleagues  on the ground are telling us that  ekracinde the rebel leader so to say
pBWp7sZG66o,32783122,32790160,right now  went late last night to gujarat  and then flew back to guwahati today
pBWp7sZG66o,32790160,32796640,morning follow me sahar right outside  the hotel where all of this is unfolding  is getting us this big breaking news
pBWp7sZG66o,32796640,32803758,coming in very interesting follow me uh  any latest on what precisely would this  visit to gujarat mean because the many
pBWp7sZG66o,32803758,32810000,of these mlas were also hold up in surat  but this is uh this is interesting late  last night when you know mary didn't
pBWp7sZG66o,32810000,32816122,really realize where is akrak shinde he  was in gujarat
pBWp7sZG66o,32818480,32823520,that's right uh pujo we are learning  this very sensational piece of news that
pBWp7sZG66o,32823520,32829040,ekna shinde flew out of guwahati late  last night a knack should they flew on a
pBWp7sZG66o,32829040,32836480,chartered flight from guwahati to  gujarat last night and flew back into  guwahati late early this morning so
pBWp7sZG66o,32836480,32842960,clearly he had a meeting over there he  met some people we ca we do not know  we're trying to ascertain which city of
pBWp7sZG66o,32842960,32848078,gujarat he landed in last night but we  do know that he flew chartered between
pBWp7sZG66o,32848078,32853360,guwahati and gujarat last night and back  this morning into guwahati this so this
pBWp7sZG66o,32853360,32859360,is the cessation piece of news that  we're bringing to you right now who did  he meet over there what sort of
pBWp7sZG66o,32859360,32866398,engagement did he have over there  remember this would be the second time  that iknow shinde has left the hotel
pBWp7sZG66o,32866398,32872878,since he arrived over here from surat a  few days ago the first time was  yesterday uh when he did step out
pBWp7sZG66o,32872878,32878640,earlier in the day between 12 31 in the  afternoon he stepped out and he drove  out with one escort vehicle and there
pBWp7sZG66o,32878640,32883680,was a lot of speculation as to where did  he go uh he came back after three hours
pBWp7sZG66o,32883680,32889520,and we learned that he was in some  personal meetings and possibly seeking  some amount of legal advice as well
pBWp7sZG66o,32889520,32894878,possibly meeting lawyers as to what  exactly should be his future course of  action uh and the faction's future
pBWp7sZG66o,32894878,32901438,course of action and late last night  when i believe that the media here had  dispersed as well not anticipating that
pBWp7sZG66o,32901438,32906558,there could be any movement uh iknow  shinde left in the dead of the night
pBWp7sZG66o,32906558,32911598,from here took a chartered flight  chartered flight to something that i can  confirm uh because of uh i've been
pBWp7sZG66o,32911598,32918238,speaking to my aviation sources as well  um he took a chartered flight he flew  out of guwahati to gujarat and then
pBWp7sZG66o,32918238,32924320,landed back in guahati early this  morning most likely not a usual aircraft  there a chartered flight there for
pBWp7sZG66o,32924320,32930800,iknack  very interesting and we are now heading  across to deepak sarkar who's now

pBWp7sZG66o,33614960,33620320,deepak sarkar speaking to anjana um  kashyap and stating that they are  definitely very confident that they are
pBWp7sZG66o,33620320,33625360,the ones which means the shinde group  will eventually somehow manage to make  the government and they're still part of
pBWp7sZG66o,33625360,33631436,the shiv senate but what you see on your  screens are two different visuals one of  the acknowledging the support of
pBWp7sZG66o,33631436,33637840,the shiv snakes of their people who are  still backing udav takri adhiti takri  acknowledging taking selfies taking
pBWp7sZG66o,33637840,33643276,visuals smiling confident fist thumping  victory sign on the other you see
pBWp7sZG66o,33643276,33649520,the group of rebel mlas now sitting in  guwahati in assam constantly eknatch in
pBWp7sZG66o,33649520,33654560,this group sending out these videos to  remind udav thakri and his group and
pBWp7sZG66o,33654560,33661756,sanjay out they have the numbers and  count as much as you want but the two  third majority is now visibly with them
pBWp7sZG66o,33661756,33666960,is their claim so what's stopping then  the shinde camp to go ahead and start to
pBWp7sZG66o,33666960,33673756,have the party on their side and  possibly take the stake to claim in to  the government in the next few weeks as
pBWp7sZG66o,33673756,33678880,well so what's happening right now as  you see it is a split of the shiv sena
pBWp7sZG66o,33678880,33684640,and therefore when it is a split of a  party that was founded by bala sahib  takari what happens to balthagar is
pBWp7sZG66o,33684640,33687120,legacy
pBWp7sZG66o,33692320,33698960,that their party's name or the group  that will be part of  but will be a splinter group it will be
pBWp7sZG66o,33698960,33706560,called the shiv sena bala sahib udav  takra is warning the rebels do not use  the name of baal takre and will also be
pBWp7sZG66o,33706560,33712320,ensuring that he's moving the election  commission to ensure that baal thakura's  name cannot be included in a splinter
pBWp7sZG66o,33712320,33719520,group or otherwise and even stating in a  scathing attack udav tagray said i quote  him yeah
pBWp7sZG66o,33720800,33725840,take your own father's name if you want  to do not use bala sahib's name remember
pBWp7sZG66o,33725840,33732400,strong words now coming out from udav  takrei's mouth and in contrast to the  emotional messages he's also saying
pBWp7sZG66o,33732400,33738880,these rebel emilies are sitting on a  ticking time bomb take a look now of how  all of this is unfolding reactions that
pBWp7sZG66o,33738880,33744720,are coming in because of the faction has  moved the election commission and in  that let out of cena and the group says
pBWp7sZG66o,33744720,33754240,they strongly object to any party being  created in the name of using the names  either of shiv sena or bala sahib thakri
pBWp7sZG66o,33754240,33757240,alright
pBWp7sZG66o,33819360,33825436,what is the action that has been uh  proceeded  in this entire meeting we are told that
pBWp7sZG66o,33825436,33831916,action was proceed done against the  rebellion we have taken unanimous  decision that shivsena will work under
pBWp7sZG66o,33831916,33836960,the leadership of bala sahib thakri and  whatever he deems fit in terms of action
pBWp7sZG66o,33836960,33843756,in terms of reaction in terms of  legalities in terms of technicalities in  terms of politically we all stand firmly
pBWp7sZG66o,33843756,33849840,behind him  uh this comes at a time when the deputy  speaker has summoned ekna cindy that he
pBWp7sZG66o,33849840,33855200,cannot take a call he should come here  and speak to the deputy speaker and on
pBWp7sZG66o,33855200,33862080,the other hand continuously shift sena  leaders are issuing warnings to the  rebel camp is it right that the way the
pBWp7sZG66o,33862080,33868560,the law and order situation is  deteriorating how is law in order  situation getting  messed up in the city are you feeling
pBWp7sZG66o,33868560,33874000,unsafe in the city  am i not roaming easily in the city who  are those who are feeling unsafe there
pBWp7sZG66o,33874000,33880080,are those who have i'll tell you those  those who have gone against the mandate  of the people gone against the symbol
pBWp7sZG66o,33880080,33886400,that they have voted uh into and into  power other ones people are angry  towards so let be rest assured mumbai's
pBWp7sZG66o,33886400,33891916,law and order is absolutely in control  we have a good police commissioner who's  handling it  not shinde saying that we are the real
pBWp7sZG66o,33891916,33897040,shifts  sena is the shinde it's such a joke it's
pBWp7sZG66o,33897040,33902080,such a joke can you even imagine a shift  cena which belongs to bala sahib thakri
pBWp7sZG66o,33902080,33907436,going to someone like national where i  think chief minister has categorically  said it if you want to start another
pBWp7sZG66o,33907436,33914960,party start it under your father's name  why should you use my father's name for  it  so there you are priyanka chutney uh you
pBWp7sZG66o,33914960,33921840,know specifying that  the shiv sena is not only uh
pBWp7sZG66o,33921840,33925200,a clearly a bala sahab
pBWp7sZG66o,33941820,33944892,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,33955840,33961520,so how has the ships say now become  slightly more aggressive they have given  out a resolution letter what does the
pBWp7sZG66o,33961520,33967360,resolution say  six quick pointers here chef cena will  always belong to bala sahib takri this
pBWp7sZG66o,33967360,33973680,after shinde senior appeared to becoming  a splinter group of the shifts in and  have bala sahib's name in it number two
pBWp7sZG66o,33973680,33979276,this is very important because at this  point they're also looking at the  strategies of the udavthak ray cena they
pBWp7sZG66o,33979276,33986560,are primarily looking at if the ballast  rename is misused remember shift sena  has always reflected a marathi pride and
pBWp7sZG66o,33986560,33993596,that being said the shiv sena says there  will be no compromise on the marathi  pride that remains remember since the
pBWp7sZG66o,33993596,33999596,beginning has been  about that specifically now let's take a  look at the third resolution that the
pBWp7sZG66o,33999596,34005520,chef cena has given out in their  resolution letter today  they're also looking at how precisely
pBWp7sZG66o,34005520,34012080,the next letter to the election  commission will be to object the use of  bala sahib's name that is if nachinde
pBWp7sZG66o,34012080,34018880,decides to go ahead with it and there  will be action against the rebel group  either for using the name of balthacry
pBWp7sZG66o,34018880,34026080,or just if they can be qualified  disqualified also for missing the  meetings will not let the rebels use
pBWp7sZG66o,34026080,34031276,bala sahib's name at all so that is  today's focus and concerned and worried
pBWp7sZG66o,34031276,34038880,if the rebel group starts to use the  name of the founder the patriarch the  father of udav takri will contest
pBWp7sZG66o,34038880,34045520,election under udav so the few mlas who  are still backing  the chefs and as it stands with uddhav
pBWp7sZG66o,34045520,34052240,takri have said we will continue to  contest elections under udhav takri only  this is the national executive remember
pBWp7sZG66o,34052240,34058640,so not just the mlas but primarily the  members of the shiv sena across the  state of maharashtra today attended the
pBWp7sZG66o,34058640,34064880,meeting and expressed their support to  udav takri  leaving you with these visuals of our
pBWp7sZG66o,34064880,34070880,aditya takri coming and meeting the  supporters clicking selfies a fist bump  there a victory sign a smiling
pBWp7sZG66o,34070880,34077040,acknowledgement to the supporters and  chefs cenax and interacting with the  media persons leaving you with these
pBWp7sZG66o,34077040,34083596,visuals of takara and other titan and  the mlas in gohati the rebel ones  i'll be right back after very short

pBWp7sZG66o,34536320,34541916,the rebels sena group making their  agenda very clear and this is the  biggest political news scoop coming in
pBWp7sZG66o,34541916,34547596,eight notch in this camp is likely to  form a rebel group and possibly a rebel  party
pBWp7sZG66o,34547596,34554960,shinde's group has sought recognition as  a separate party in an exclusive  conversation with india today
pBWp7sZG66o,34555840,34563916,has sent a letter to the deputy speaker  and they want now to be recognized as  and i quote that here a shiv sena of the

pBWp7sZG66o,35383840,35391040,can you imagine your life without swiggy  dunzo zamato zepto  well let's just nod in agreement that
pBWp7sZG66o,35391040,35397120,life would not be the same without these  apps but can we look at them with the  final lens
pBWp7sZG66o,35397120,35403840,after the pandemic reliance on these  apps increased and so did the demand and  supply for gig work across india
pBWp7sZG66o,35403840,35408880,according to task mode gig index  gig work consists of income earning
pBWp7sZG66o,35408880,35415040,activities outside of traditional  long-term employer employee  relationships so essentially these gig
pBWp7sZG66o,35415040,35421276,workers are those who are delivering the  items you order through these apps but  there are problems this workforce is
pBWp7sZG66o,35421276,35426720,facing problems around social security  rights and working rights
pBWp7sZG66o,35426720,35433520,these problems are also the primary  cause of distress among the emerging  form of employees
pBWp7sZG66o,35434960,35440480,so let's explain what a gig economy is  gig economy is a free market where
pBWp7sZG66o,35440480,35445756,organizations like ola uber zamato and  swiggy hire or contract workers for a
pBWp7sZG66o,35445756,35451916,short span of time basically these are  temporary positions to meet the  company's immediate requirements
pBWp7sZG66o,35451916,35459596,gig workers are those who are part of  this economy they work independently on  call or on a temporary basis
pBWp7sZG66o,35459596,35464880,india is the fifth largest gig economy  according to an india staffing  federation report
pBWp7sZG66o,35464880,35471596,in india over 15 million workers are  employed as gig workers across the  industries and digital platforms played
pBWp7sZG66o,35471596,35477796,an important role in helping job seekers  find these kick work
pBWp7sZG66o,35478560,35484800,gig workers suffer from the lack of  social security sanitary working  conditions and working rights so this
pBWp7sZG66o,35484800,35492320,sector is highly unregulated which like  any unregulated sector results in  nominal benefits and reduce security you
pBWp7sZG66o,35492320,35500400,can call this a shinier extension of  india's unorganized labor economy  according to india's code on wages 2019
pBWp7sZG66o,35500400,35506720,a universal minimum wage and floor wage  should be provided to all organized and  unorganized sectors
pBWp7sZG66o,35506720,35513596,that includes gig workers  likewise the code on social security  2020 recognizes gig workers as a new
pBWp7sZG66o,35513596,35518640,category  that also makes them eligible for  benefits like maternity benefits life
pBWp7sZG66o,35518640,35526000,and disability cover old age protection  provident fund and employment injury  benefits however the eligibility does
pBWp7sZG66o,35526000,35553540,not guarantee that they will get these  benefits  [Music]

pBWp7sZG66o,35647120,35653360,um but do you think it's better than  what's been written in cinema rules  written especially for women that's what
pBWp7sZG66o,35653360,35662080,i'm saying i don't know because jalsa  was great it's a film  then gangubai the part was uh great
pBWp7sZG66o,35662080,35668560,then uh  you know deepika's just uh done nagera  here which was written for a woman
pBWp7sZG66o,35668560,35674720,uh  then and they have  many films which were also quite strong
pBWp7sZG66o,35674720,35680560,parts uh forensic was also  a strong woman character
pBWp7sZG66o,35680560,35687200,so i think it's more or less the same  [Music]  which i'm aware of on twitter though i
pBWp7sZG66o,35687200,35693360,don't actively participate in  i'm aware of the fact that there there  is a debate online about you know why
pBWp7sZG66o,35693360,35699840,should we you know remake films that  have already been made  uh  maybe it's just a phase right now
pBWp7sZG66o,35699840,35705360,but it's it's also very cyclical and  creatively speaking as she said uh in

pBWp7sZG66o,36131596,36137596,the law and order situation is  deteriorating how is law in order  situation getting messed up in the city

pBWp7sZG66o,36149680,36156000,that they have voted uh into and into  power other ones people are angry  towards so let be rest assured mumbai's
pBWp7sZG66o,36156000,36161200,law and order is absolutely in control  we have a good police commissioner who's  handling it iknow saying that we are the
pBWp7sZG66o,36161200,36167276,real shifts  it's such a joke it's such a joke can
pBWp7sZG66o,36167276,36173520,you even imagine a shift cena which  belongs to bala sahib takri going to  someone like inique national where i
pBWp7sZG66o,36173520,36178640,think chief minister has categorically  said it if you want to start another  party start it under your father's name
pBWp7sZG66o,36178640,36184080,why why should you use my father's name  for it  so there you are priyanka chittarweedy
pBWp7sZG66o,36184080,36190880,uh you know specifying that  the shiv sena is not only
pBWp7sZG66o,36190960,36198400,uh uh clearly a bala sahab takrez  shirsena but it is a shivsera that is  identified with uddhav takre with video
pBWp7sZG66o,36198400,36206596,journalist sanjay this is me saying in  mumbai for india today  petition file
pBWp7sZG66o,36211380,36214448,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,36222320,36227436,let's go across now to my colleague  mustafa sheikh tracking all the latest  on that mustafa eventually it will be
pBWp7sZG66o,36227436,36232800,about whether the shinde sena can manage  that splinter group of bala sahib but uh
pBWp7sZG66o,36232800,36238800,do you think udav takri and this group  ensuring that they don't get that  opportunity at all
pBWp7sZG66o,36242960,36248880,well the question at this point of time  is uh what who has the numbers the  better numbers
pBWp7sZG66o,36260960,36268720,that we have the two third majority  sooner or later we will get the party  symbol that happened the same case of  aid mk we have precedence in place so
pBWp7sZG66o,36268720,36277400,only what the mba is doing at this point  of time is buying time for themselves  the eventuality has been decided back to
pBWp7sZG66o,36277756,36282880,happening we can see natas are reacting  atably also says we support the shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,36282880,36290480,group but the udav takri group  we are meeting acknowledging supporters  so if you can also uh i understand that
pBWp7sZG66o,36290480,36296240,uh you may be right now surrounded with  other natas as well and you are am i  being i'm being told at another
pBWp7sZG66o,36296240,36302640,politician's residence but if you can  update mustafa of how precisely the  shifts and as it stands today will
pBWp7sZG66o,36302640,36306880,continue to take a confident aggressive  approach
pBWp7sZG66o,36310400,36315756,well what shifting is doing right now  is trying to gather as much as civic as
pBWp7sZG66o,36315756,36322400,possible to understand the situation to  understand what has been the damage to  the party remember in the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,36322400,36328800,assembly there has been huge damage  two-thirds is the number which ignacinda  has somewhere shivsana and udot is
pBWp7sZG66o,36328800,36336240,assuming and hoping that some of the  analysts jump ship from mcmaster camp  that is only which can save uh which can
pBWp7sZG66o,36336240,36342160,affect anti-defection law if that does  not happen then it's a clear two-third  majority and hence at this point of time
pBWp7sZG66o,36342160,36349040,is planning and motivating and boosting  its kada because even if the government  is lost shishna will again have to fight
pBWp7sZG66o,36349040,36356800,the upcoming bmc elections on the on the  qatar which is left it's possible that  this rift extends from the maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,36356800,36362400,assembly and goes on the local levels  where corporations will also be  distributed and people shift
pBWp7sZG66o,36362400,36367596,loyalty so that is something with the  ships and is bracing for back to you  mustafa keep tracking the latest on that
pBWp7sZG66o,36367596,36374240,so of course a lot of strategies  permutations and combinations that are  on but udav  remember had a national executive
pBWp7sZG66o,36374240,36380320,meeting today  [Music]  turning their stand slightly aggressive
pBWp7sZG66o,36380320,36386720,what does the shift say now under the  leadership of udav talk they say today  in their resolution letter six important
pBWp7sZG66o,36386720,36393360,points the highlights here the takeaways  now on top it is all about bala sahib's  name that udav takre and the shiv sena
pBWp7sZG66o,36393360,36400640,says we will not let anyone else use it  it always belongs the shiv sin as it  stands will always belong to bala sahib
pBWp7sZG66o,36400640,36406400,takri the founder of the patriarch the  father of udav takre which means there  will be no compromise on the marathi
pBWp7sZG66o,36406400,36413120,pride which primarily has been the focus  of the foundation of the shiv sena but  why specifically about the marathi pride
pBWp7sZG66o,36413120,36420880,they are stating that nobody will be  allowed to misuse the name of bala sahib  takre and therefore any such reference
pBWp7sZG66o,36420880,36426000,or action on it will be objected to and  that is why a letter has been written to  the election commission by the
pBWp7sZG66o,36426000,36432960,parliamentary senate objecting to  anyone's use of that name which means if  the rebel group decides to go ahead and
pBWp7sZG66o,36432960,36438560,misuse it they will be disqualified  there will be action taken against it  now number five is very important will
pBWp7sZG66o,36438560,36443916,not let the rebels use bala sahib's name  making it very clear that this is our
pBWp7sZG66o,36443916,36449840,point of the resolution today of the  national executive of the shiv cena  which includes not just the mlas but the
pBWp7sZG66o,36449840,36456480,members there all across for the party  but number six  eventually expressing support saying we
pBWp7sZG66o,36456480,36462720,will contest only under the leadership  of udavtakri as it stands with regard to  the shiv cena so the national executive
pBWp7sZG66o,36462720,36468560,members coming out in support for udav  takri  so some of those party natas they're
pBWp7sZG66o,36468560,36475276,ensuring and members of the party to  continue to show support for udav takri  but it will be as you can see a legacy
pBWp7sZG66o,36475276,36481680,war on bala sahib's name now  because iknow sindh is clearly moving in
pBWp7sZG66o,36481680,36487916,for the kill pushing for a new name at  least of a splinter group and he will be  aiming to call it shiv senna
pBWp7sZG66o,36487916,36494800,sahib udav takri digging in his heels  will not accept any of that happening  and hits out at the shinde camp saying
pBWp7sZG66o,36494800,36500800,shiv sena and the tak rays are  synonymous with each other and is  threatening the rebel group against
pBWp7sZG66o,36500800,36504880,using the name of his father
pBWp7sZG66o,36508080,36514720,which is the real shivsena  who will inherit balashab takrei's
pBWp7sZG66o,36514720,36521680,legacy  [Music]  and who will rule maharashtra
pBWp7sZG66o,36523840,36531040,this raging political mahabharata has  now entered a legal battleground  both chief minister udav takrei and
pBWp7sZG66o,36531040,36538720,revel eknat shinde  are staking claim as the rightful heir  of shiv sena
pBWp7sZG66o,36538960,36541960,senator
pBWp7sZG66o,36567840,36573436,37 mlas have broken rank from the uddhav  sena they are now the majority leaving
pBWp7sZG66o,36573436,36578960,the original shift cena to be reduced to  a minority party
pBWp7sZG66o,36578960,36584640,and now  shinde sena is moving in for the kill
pBWp7sZG66o,36588480,36591596,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,36632160,36637680,is digging in his heels hitting out at  shinde camp saying shift cena and tack
pBWp7sZG66o,36637680,36641560,rays are synonyms
pBWp7sZG66o,36646320,36649320,foreign
pBWp7sZG66o,36657880,36660928,[Music]
pBWp7sZG66o,36663756,36671120,the matter can be only decided by the  election commission  election commission will also decide on
pBWp7sZG66o,36671120,36679200,allotment of party symbol on set rules  if aknachinde seeks official recognition
pBWp7sZG66o,36679916,36685040,till then the war of words war for  legacy and the war for power will only
pBWp7sZG66o,36685040,36690000,get bigger bureau report india today
pBWp7sZG66o,36690240,36695680,our editor kamla sutra joins me now on  this live telecast accomplish because  with the experience that you have of
pBWp7sZG66o,36695680,36701520,covering maharashtra politics how will  this play out because it will not be  that easy even for shinde to take the
pBWp7sZG66o,36701520,36708400,name of bala sahib as a splinter group  or a new party so how is udav thakri  stopping it and how is aknach in there
pBWp7sZG66o,36708400,36713200,ensuring that he manages to now lead the  new group
pBWp7sZG66o,36714480,36721436,it will happen on two uh you know two  grounds first uh it has to be the  political narrative one will have to be
pBWp7sZG66o,36721436,36728240,played on the political front and one on  the legal front on the political front  uddhav  since yesterday we have seen is trying
pBWp7sZG66o,36728240,36735756,to create a narrative that the shivsena  is being hijacked taken over by  something else and that is why he's into  huddle with his uh with his party
pBWp7sZG66o,36735756,36741040,leaders and uh all party workers we have  seen with the  taking to the streets uh meeting his
pBWp7sZG66o,36741040,36747840,party workers holding meeting with the  corporators district uh uh district  chiefs and other persons in our leaders
pBWp7sZG66o,36747840,36754080,that is on one part of the chiefs saying  that we are the original shiv sena and  this is just a breakaway faction from
pBWp7sZG66o,36754080,36759840,the shiv sena on the other hand we've  seen iknack india trying to create that  narrative by saying we are the original
pBWp7sZG66o,36759840,36765596,sinner we are taking forward his legacy  and his ideology that is what uh the  pakistan also said in this press
pBWp7sZG66o,36765596,36771436,conference we have not walked out of  chief cena we have not quit the shiv  sena that is what they are trying to say  yes on the other hand look at the
pBWp7sZG66o,36771436,36777756,legislative party the legislative the  city party's majority is certainly with  aknac in their group they has the two
pBWp7sZG66o,36777756,36783040,third majority that is required to form  a separate group but uh uddhav takri  made it clear this afternoon that you
pBWp7sZG66o,36783040,36788720,cannot use the name of either shiv sena  nor balasam though it is ultimately for  the election commission to decide what
pBWp7sZG66o,36788720,36794560,the is just trying to send across a  message that you cannot use our name and  our legacy you can use your father's
pBWp7sZG66o,36794560,36800880,name not mine that is on the other hand  but uh it as as we've been as experts  have been saying that since they have
pBWp7sZG66o,36800880,36806720,two third majority though they cannot be  disqualified they will have to merge  their group into other party now that is
pBWp7sZG66o,36806720,36812720,where the catch is so the legal battle  is going to go on for another few days  this is not just ending soon both on the
pBWp7sZG66o,36812720,36820400,political front as well as a legal front  also iknow is very confident at this  point uh kamlesh that they will not be
pBWp7sZG66o,36820400,36827120,disqualified we have some big news  coming in but i do have uh a point that  you know it will continue to be there
pBWp7sZG66o,36827120,36834320,it'll it's a port boiler that you know  is witnessing constant twists and turns  and i'll come back to you accomplish on  that we have some more news coming in
pBWp7sZG66o,36834320,36837840,let's take a look at that
pBWp7sZG66o,36841436,36847520,all right we what you're having and  details coming in from maharashtra  remember it's a developing story kamlesh
pBWp7sZG66o,36847520,36851560,as you continue to be with me
pBWp7sZG66o,36852560,36856560,all right this news is regarding
pBWp7sZG66o,36857840,36864320,we have some more developments coming in  from the state of maharashtra this at  this point what you're looking at are
pBWp7sZG66o,36864320,36870000,the visuals of  this  we're now being told that the activist  is
pBWp7sZG66o,36870000,36875120,brought into the santa cruz police  station the gujarat anti-terror squad  officials were there but now tista
pBWp7sZG66o,36875120,36882000,sitalbar has been taken into arrest by  the gujarat ats team she will be brought  to ahmedabad crime branch so uh
pBWp7sZG66o,36882000,36890080,definitely it appears that uh a time of  trouble for this  this is remember as after the court also
pBWp7sZG66o,36890080,36896000,uh  continuing to give a clean [ __ ] with  regard to prime minister narendra modi  minister amit shahid also said that
pBWp7sZG66o,36896000,36902080,there were deliberate conspiracy  theories and misinformation campaign  that was targeted at the prime minister
pBWp7sZG66o,36902080,36909520,but now  activist trista sitalwar has been taken  into a rest  by the gujarat ats team the anti-terror
pBWp7sZG66o,36909520,36915520,squad that's the details that's coming  in remember this is big news at this  point because this is the gujarat police
pBWp7sZG66o,36915520,36921520,the gujarat ats that has taken into  account she's currently in mumbai she
pBWp7sZG66o,36921520,36927276,was brought to the santa cruz police  station and from there she's likely to  be taken to the mdhabat crime branch uh
pBWp7sZG66o,36927276,36932480,we'll be shortly getting our reporters  on the ground as well  but this is the latest that i can tell
pBWp7sZG66o,36932480,36938720,you is has come as a confirmation just  about half an hour ago she was brought  to the santa cruz police station now
pBWp7sZG66o,36938720,36945360,this is about siphoning of funds this is  about misinformation campaign that is
pBWp7sZG66o,36945360,36950960,and this specifically is about the 2002  rats that had taken place in the state
pBWp7sZG66o,36950960,36957840,of gujarat the gujarat police we are  being told uh has registered a case  against three accused not only justice
pBWp7sZG66o,36957840,36963360,tasi talward but former ips officer  sanjeev bhatt former ips officer rb sri
pBWp7sZG66o,36963360,36968960,kumar and this is now been taken into  address so this was about giving false
pBWp7sZG66o,36968960,36975756,information  wrong information and consistently  focusing on that and also pushing the
pBWp7sZG66o,36975756,36982000,target with regard to now prime minister  narendra modi who was then the chief  minister of the state of gujarat
pBWp7sZG66o,36982000,36988240,remember that there were several  petitions that were put by  zakiyah jafri
pBWp7sZG66o,36988240,36994240,in the court and it is being alleged  that there was also some false  information that was provoked by tista
pBWp7sZG66o,36994240,37000800,sitalvar  and was pushed by her to have zakiyah  jafri petition in the court with that
pBWp7sZG66o,37000800,37006800,false and fake information to the  special investigation team head and to  other commissions now the investigation
pBWp7sZG66o,37006800,37013916,has found out that through these  petitions the information that was added  was it at the behest of the activist
pBWp7sZG66o,37013916,37018960,pista sitalwa who's now been taken into  arrest uh as of now the details that we
pBWp7sZG66o,37018960,37025756,have on our screens is that eventually  as you can see these are the latest  visuals the arrest has come
pBWp7sZG66o,37025756,37032320,but what happens next because we can  already see that at this point this is  uh just to give you a background this
pBWp7sZG66o,37032320,37038880,always has been a known activist  specifically with regard to the 2002  gujarat riots campaigns and consistently
pBWp7sZG66o,37038880,37044880,had been putting out information on  target was the then chief minister
pBWp7sZG66o,37044880,37050800,narendra modi but now with the court  also now continuing to give a clean [ __ ]  and home minister amit also speaking
pBWp7sZG66o,37050800,37057916,today saying there was a deliberate  conspiracy campaigns targeted at him i  saw him suffer quietly for 20 years but
pBWp7sZG66o,37057916,37064720,now this with regard to the petition of  zakiyah jafri  the allegations are was it by tista
pBWp7sZG66o,37064720,37072080,sitalvar and at her behest  that there was false information that  was being pushed through
pBWp7sZG66o,37072080,37079596,former ips officer sanjeev bhatt has  been named in the fire former ips  officer arvi srikumar has also been
pBWp7sZG66o,37079596,37082480,named in this
pBWp7sZG66o,37086640,37092880,so we are staying with these uh story  right now the big news that is coming in  because at this point remember sitalbar
pBWp7sZG66o,37092880,37098160,had gained a lot of prominence with her  campaigns with regard to the 2002 riots
pBWp7sZG66o,37098160,37103840,case but  now as it appears that could there have  been false and incorrect information
pBWp7sZG66o,37103840,37109360,that had been pushed out but this is  specifically about her ngo this is an
pBWp7sZG66o,37109360,37115040,ngo citizens for peace and that also has  faced siphoning of funds and incorrect
pBWp7sZG66o,37115040,37121436,information that she had been spreading  so there are two different cases here  that has been referenced to initially
pBWp7sZG66o,37121436,37127436,she was detained by the gujarat  anti-terror squad officers who had  reached a residence had taken her to the
pBWp7sZG66o,37127436,37133520,santa cruz police station which is as  per protocol and then after that she's  now been taken into arrest and likely
pBWp7sZG66o,37133520,37139840,will be now moved to gujarat the  investigation found out that there was  false information that was given through
pBWp7sZG66o,37139840,37146420,a petition  and that is now emerging with the action  that is being taken against her
pBWp7sZG66o,37146420,37152720,[Music]  this is the fire copy there on your
pBWp7sZG66o,37152720,37158160,screens right now  and  there are the details of not only three

pBWp7sZG66o,37170560,37176880,we can see that the three names that  have been mentioned here all of this of  course remember is in some way also
pBWp7sZG66o,37176880,37184320,interconnected this is after zakia  jaffrey whose husband essan jaffrey was  killed in the 2002 gujarat riots case
pBWp7sZG66o,37184320,37190080,the petitions that she had been putting  in the court  uh and the court today uh yesterday i

pBWp7sZG66o,37196560,37202800,being raised and now the investigation  according to the officers of the ats  that the petitions had mentioned and
pBWp7sZG66o,37202800,37210480,inputs by t stasi talvart and most of it  appeared to be incorrect is what the  investigation had found

pBWp7sZG66o,38351596,38358720,what later was confirmed by  sources by our mumbai  sahil is that
pBWp7sZG66o,38358720,38363840,there was indeed a late night meeting in  madoda involving top leaders of not only
pBWp7sZG66o,38363840,38371916,of uh bjp but also hillary what was what  is uh participated in that meeting what  we did was we tried the flight data data
pBWp7sZG66o,38371916,38380160,and we observed that at least four  different private jets took off from  guwahati from delhi from mumbai and then
pBWp7sZG66o,38380160,38387120,it went by indoors  it all started at around 8 00 pm in uh  yesterday evening when a private jet
pBWp7sZG66o,38387120,38392960,that flew from delhi landed at kohati it  stayed there for about two and a half  hours at around 10 30 p.m yesterday

pBWp7sZG66o,38437520,38443276,so clearly at this point when we look at  this development as is being confirmed  by india today
pBWp7sZG66o,38443276,38449436,could this be perhaps a clarity more  that the bhartiya janata party is all  out to support aknach in the under rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,38449436,38455436,group  yeah it's a truth  the truth everyone knows it
pBWp7sZG66o,38455436,38463276,that since beginning  the visiting is behind it we were  knowing it the bjp is only doing it you
pBWp7sZG66o,38463276,38470480,just think of it  how much money is being spent on this  from there only you can make out
pBWp7sZG66o,38470480,38476160,who can do that who has got so much of  power we have got so much of money
pBWp7sZG66o,38476160,38482080,that that shows now the politics is  being rained in the country
pBWp7sZG66o,38484880,38490720,so the bjp says we have nothing to do  with this we are not in a hurry we are  waiting it is up to the shift cena to
pBWp7sZG66o,38490720,38496960,decide so this is the official stand yes  this is again this is again a deceptive  way out there expressing their views you
pBWp7sZG66o,38496960,38503564,know the fact is that why they go to i  mean went to surah
pBWp7sZG66o,38515520,38522160,see how  the how come the gujarat police  gives the support to such an extent
pBWp7sZG66o,38522160,38528000,around the 2004 they say 300 400 police  officers were there  that shows
pBWp7sZG66o,38528000,38534480,it's bjp nothing else nothing no you  don't need any investigation  sir as my colleague ankit kumar is
pBWp7sZG66o,38534480,38541040,giving us details said the aircraft went  to vadodara not  about the city there but also in uh you
pBWp7sZG66o,38541040,38547276,know giving details that it's  who the meeting was with but at this  point mr arvind savant it's not that
pBWp7sZG66o,38547276,38552640,they can immediately stay claimed to the  government so what do you think the  secret meetings are for they will have
pBWp7sZG66o,38552640,38560320,to have their own party  important issue is that okay we don't  bother we have that we have the uh power
pBWp7sZG66o,38560320,38566720,to come again fly like a finnish  series  so through isis we will try again we
pBWp7sZG66o,38566720,38573680,have we have experiences in the past  this type of blow shifts and has extends  in the past also so we know how to come
pBWp7sZG66o,38573680,38580000,up with all these things but the greed  of the people for the power  is being seen by the country over here
pBWp7sZG66o,38580000,38588080,and for the power what a party of our  differences  behaves party of a difference
pBWp7sZG66o,38588080,38595276,is  behaving the way they are behaving they  are destroying the democratic
pBWp7sZG66o,38595276,38600480,culture of the country  i request you to stay on our senior  executive editor sahil joshi is also now
pBWp7sZG66o,38600480,38606320,joining me uh sahil a big scoop there  and arvin savin the ships and mps  joining us over to you if you would like
pBWp7sZG66o,38606320,38611680,to take also a question here  well mr salman what it seems now that
pBWp7sZG66o,38611680,38618080,the mr shinde has the numbers they are  saying that they have two third mlas  with them 38 mls they are claiming to
pBWp7sZG66o,38618080,38623116,have  which indeed  if they have the numbers nobody can stop  them from at least forming a separate
pBWp7sZG66o,38623116,38628320,group may not be the shifts in our  legislative party group but some other  group and eventually if they decide they
pBWp7sZG66o,38628320,38634320,can merge with other party what it seems  is that your government seems to be in  the minority at this point of time do
pBWp7sZG66o,38634320,38640880,you expect except that you don't have  the numbers at this point of time or you  still think that once these mlas are
pBWp7sZG66o,38640880,38647520,back in mumbai you can still gather them  together and form the government again  or to save your government again
pBWp7sZG66o,38647520,38653840,the latter part of your statement is  much more important you know the fact is  that there are number of
pBWp7sZG66o,38653840,38659436,mlas who are in touch with us they are  saying that we are being forcibly
pBWp7sZG66o,38659436,38667040,confined to the hotel they are not  allowed to go anywhere and you see the  way it was they were
pBWp7sZG66o,38667040,38670480,kept under the cage at
pBWp7sZG66o,38674160,38680240,handling the people over there and  therefore we have today also we have  said our doors are open if they come
pBWp7sZG66o,38680240,38686400,it's okay to come still we are ready to  pass the situation we don't bother even  if there's two third another thing but
pBWp7sZG66o,38686400,38692960,they can take it from me that the  law says they cannot remain
pBWp7sZG66o,38692960,38698800,a separate group  they cannot be their existence will not  be a separate group they will have to
pBWp7sZG66o,38698800,38704720,merge with someone update that they the  moment they show that their truth are  more than two thirds they'll have to
pBWp7sZG66o,38704720,38711200,merge with someone either it is a bjp or  it may be  our party wherever they but they cannot
pBWp7sZG66o,38711200,38718000,remain as a shiva okay keep it in mind  you are saying
pBWp7sZG66o,38718160,38726884,the people we are  we are  all those are bogus statements you know
pBWp7sZG66o,38732240,38739040,what about those people who were there  in mumbai they didn't go to surat on the  first day on on tuesday they were here
pBWp7sZG66o,38739040,38744160,in mumbai they were part of your meeting  in varsha they were part of the meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,38744160,38750480,they were even protesting against  the next day what we saw is that they  were
pBWp7sZG66o,38750640,38754680,you must have heard yeah
pBWp7sZG66o,38759276,38765040,um feel that the people should be  confined forcibly  if they don't have a will to continue
pBWp7sZG66o,38765040,38771756,let them go and you are meeting  if they decide to go don't forget for
pBWp7sZG66o,38771756,38777680,them to stay in thought and let them go  and that is why we have given the  freedom and they have been sold out
pBWp7sZG66o,38777680,38784640,everyone knows but you do you people  don't have daring to speak about it  everyone knows you have confidence to
pBWp7sZG66o,38784640,38791436,take their own confidence  which they never dreamed of they were  never dreamed up that much amount has
pBWp7sZG66o,38791436,38797360,been offered to them and the people  either  threatening
pBWp7sZG66o,38797840,38803680,have been applied and people have gone  for that okay let them go if they don't  believe in the thoughts this is your

pBWp7sZG66o,39027276,39033200,that took place  reveals a lot more that could be
pBWp7sZG66o,39033200,39038720,happening behind closed doors  well that is something which is really
pBWp7sZG66o,39038720,39044880,interesting because this is the first  time after what happened that day okay  uh you know after uh

pBWp7sZG66o,39057276,39063276,let's let's understand the chronology  how it started uh on 10th of june there  were there were rajya sabha elections in
pBWp7sZG66o,39063276,39070720,maharashtra the 10th of june uh uh  nda the bjp got 10 votes more from the
pBWp7sZG66o,39070720,39077520,mva quota so there were 10 mlas who  cross voted to the bjp side these mlas  were morally mostly independent and the
pBWp7sZG66o,39077520,39083276,smaller parties that's what the mba  thought didn't pay much of the attention  they still had the majority now on 20th
pBWp7sZG66o,39083276,39090240,of june there were  without parish elections the legislative  council elections in those elections 21
pBWp7sZG66o,39090240,39095680,people from mva cross voted to the bjp  but that was not enough the cross voting
pBWp7sZG66o,39095680,39105240,happened within shift cinema as well and  that was the ringing bell after that the  party woke up and started calling
pBWp7sZG66o,39107040,39112640,after that from the next day onwards  it's out of mumbai so devendra davis
pBWp7sZG66o,39112640,39118080,meeting ekna cindy clearly shows now  that there will be a last leg of this
pBWp7sZG66o,39118080,39125040,whole  interesting are we looking at perhaps  the next big move sahil with regard to  the government formation or perhaps how

pBWp7sZG66o,39988480,39996560,the real question remains unanswered who  is the real chef cena  bureau report india today
pBWp7sZG66o,39998240,40003756,and not joining me on this live telecast  is kamala shutter live from mumbai also  rithik bhalikar he's right outside the
pBWp7sZG66o,40003756,40008800,vidan bhavan ritwik first over to you  what does the present situation look  like because this is today an aggressive
pBWp7sZG66o,40008800,40015276,stand by the shifts and as it stands and  out of taqre they are trying to send out  threats a resolution letter against the
pBWp7sZG66o,40015276,40021432,rebel mlas what are you witnessing how  do the streets of mumbai look like today
pBWp7sZG66o,40023428,40030720,[Music]  yes so the president's situation seems  very difficult for without hakri because
pBWp7sZG66o,40030720,40036880,it is not just a fight for saving mahavi  kasagari government but it has
pBWp7sZG66o,40036880,40044480,becoming a battle to save his own  existence his own survival is a party  shift sena because what ekna chinda is
pBWp7sZG66o,40044480,40051840,doing  is sending across the resolutions the  letters the proposals the motions to the
pBWp7sZG66o,40051840,40057520,deputy speaker of maharashtra assembly  on the letterhead of official shiv senna
pBWp7sZG66o,40057520,40066160,party and what is trying to do he is  trying to claim the control over the  party uh this was unexpected and he uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40066160,40072560,uh cmuddo is caught completely unaware  uh we from the sources of senna uh got
pBWp7sZG66o,40072560,40079276,to know that they were knowing that  there is discontent in the party there  is there are disagreements but at the
pBWp7sZG66o,40079276,40085436,most only 20 to 25 mlas would go and  join shinde camp but this turned out to
pBWp7sZG66o,40085436,40093756,be a huge coup uh because more than 35  mlas are with shinde uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40093756,40099276,uh stay on with me ritwik because our  editor kabletooth also uh for a  perspective on this kamlish how do you
pBWp7sZG66o,40099276,40105596,look at this aggressive stand by the  chef sena at least for the past few  hours threatening disqualification
pBWp7sZG66o,40105596,40112240,notice stating use your own father's  name why use baltacra's name  and this despite knowing they do not
pBWp7sZG66o,40112240,40119432,have the numbers the number is with ekna  cindy who's already meeting devin rafat  navas in vadodara
pBWp7sZG66o,40120400,40126160,well if you look at sanjay out statement  yesterday sanjarat made a very cryptic  statement yesterday and that can be seen
pBWp7sZG66o,40126160,40131756,fanning out uh today sanjay outside that  will win the battle on the floor of the  house as well as on the streets we see
pBWp7sZG66o,40131756,40138560,shivsena workers taking to the streets  and then there's vandalism that is  happening uh  the offices of rebel mlas are being
pBWp7sZG66o,40138560,40145436,targeted posters having torn  and on the other hand the legal team is  working day in and day out
pBWp7sZG66o,40145436,40151116,two days before a legal team also was  consulted in delhi which constituted of  senior lawyers from the supreme court as
pBWp7sZG66o,40151116,40156640,well as some constitutional experts  their opinion was sort of what next can  be done whether these mls could be
pBWp7sZG66o,40156640,40164320,disqualified what if they challenge how  long is this going to continue whether  disqualification notice can be issued uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40164320,40170800,to the entire chunk of a rebel mls or  just a part of it 16 mls have been  served with that notice we saw that
pBWp7sZG66o,40170800,40176560,today they have been asked to present  their side by monday evening now if that  happens the shift senate is also
pBWp7sZG66o,40176560,40183436,weighing all the legal options the more  this gets delayed  a section in shiv sena and ncp rather in
pBWp7sZG66o,40183436,40188880,mahavira he believes that the more such  cases delay more the possibility of the
pBWp7sZG66o,40188880,40195116,rebel camp getting anxious so uh they  want to take it they want to take the  legal route want it
pBWp7sZG66o,40195116,40202080,are also speculations that this might  end up in the supreme court as well but  the rebel camp and uh perhaps a group
pBWp7sZG66o,40202080,40208720,that is with them is trying to finish it  off as early as possible okay before  anything any action could be taken
pBWp7sZG66o,40208720,40215040,against that rebel mla they would like  to take the further step and perhaps  that is why we saw a late night meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,40215040,40220480,a very secret meeting between devendra  fadnavis and cindy taking place in  vadodara last night maybe there was no
pBWp7sZG66o,40220480,40227200,strategize but this perhaps could be  going in further direction where we can  see and is this is this
pBWp7sZG66o,40227200,40233756,sign of the times to come we have some  big news coming in here in the evening  bulletin more inside scoop into wake not
pBWp7sZG66o,40233756,40240960,in this gujarat visit late last night  the details are emerging of this gujarat  visit a secret visit but now india today
pBWp7sZG66o,40240960,40246400,brings you all the latest what our  sources have confirmed that late last  night
pBWp7sZG66o,40246720,40253596,met devendra ford of the martial at the  party and chande traveled to vadodara in  a chartered aircraft all of this was
pBWp7sZG66o,40253596,40260720,secret nobody knew where eight nation  they had flown back to but before the  news could go out he was back in goharte
pBWp7sZG66o,40260720,40266000,early morning and this is now the  details coming in that we have from
pBWp7sZG66o,40266000,40271040,vadodara that ignacion they did meet  devendrapadnaves in badudra and this
pBWp7sZG66o,40271040,40277520,precisely as of now there was no  confirmation if it was just devendra  padnavis who he definitely met or were
pBWp7sZG66o,40277520,40283276,there any senior leaders from the bjp or  was there any other central uh minister
pBWp7sZG66o,40283276,40288720,as well in that meeting  but now more sources are telling us that
pBWp7sZG66o,40288720,40294560,at that point point last night home  minister amit shah was also in vadodara
pBWp7sZG66o,40294560,40300560,at about 10 to 11 p.m and around  midnight in varudara yesterday but  there's no confirmation or clarity yet
pBWp7sZG66o,40300560,40307276,if they were if um  they met home minister amitya also  but as of now it appears that there was
pBWp7sZG66o,40307276,40314640,definitely devendra padnavez and ho  minister amichya yesterday in madodra  and so was iknachinde saurabhaktanya
pBWp7sZG66o,40314640,40321116,tracking all the latest this from mumbai  for us uh saurabh because you're  covering both the politics in gujarat
pBWp7sZG66o,40321116,40326880,also in maharashtra and getting us this  big scoop details do tell us what's  happening was there a meeting between
pBWp7sZG66o,40326880,40333436,aknac india and devendra padnavez or it  was it just too much of a coincidence  that late last night when he flew to
pBWp7sZG66o,40333436,40341116,vadodara there was devendra navis in the  city there was also home minister amit  shah at the same time
pBWp7sZG66o,40343680,40351276,so well puja what we know from our  sources is that  devendra fatnevis was in varuda
pBWp7sZG66o,40355840,40361520,actually escaped the whole uh media  outside the guwahati hotel without any
pBWp7sZG66o,40361520,40367916,security and without such high uh cars  and anything we have been told that he
pBWp7sZG66o,40367916,40375436,left from the baguette without anyone  knowing and through a special flight  from guwahati he reached vadodara and at
pBWp7sZG66o,40375436,40380880,varuda he met a former chief minister of  maharashtra devendra fatnavis now this
pBWp7sZG66o,40380880,40387596,was a closed door meeting and just few  hours meeting which was very important  aspects were discussed because we know
pBWp7sZG66o,40387596,40394160,that this gud cena is trying to delay  the whole process but the shinde camp  and the bjp themselves know that
pBWp7sZG66o,40394160,40400320,delaying the whole procedure can break  the mlas in the rebel camp and therefore  a very soon some decision has to be
pBWp7sZG66o,40400320,40405916,taken say by monday or tuesday what we  know that this was a very crucial piece
pBWp7sZG66o,40405916,40411916,of meeting so uh sort of bringing us  that latest that there was home minister  ahmed shah there was also davindra nova
pBWp7sZG66o,40411916,40417756,is the former chief minister of  maharashtra i want to go back to kamla  shutter on this complete very  interesting we have some of the visuals
pBWp7sZG66o,40417756,40423840,running about humanist  so should we just see this as a
pBWp7sZG66o,40423840,40430000,coincidence or any more details if there  was a meeting in fact between these  nethers
pBWp7sZG66o,40430480,40435916,uh well as sarah was pointing out uh we  cannot ascertain that uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40436800,40442880,and when the photo is met but yes in  politics such coincidences can never be  ignored amicha's very presence in
pBWp7sZG66o,40442880,40450880,vadodara the same evening when divine  referendums took that route via indore  to vadodra and ignacinda took
pBWp7sZG66o,40450880,40457200,the chartered flight from guati to delhi  to reach to vadhra this just cannot be a  coincidence or in politics such
pBWp7sZG66o,40457200,40462960,coincidence can never be ignored they  may have met they may not have met but  the three were in madodra the same
pBWp7sZG66o,40462960,40469436,evening the same late night uh remains  one important aspect of the entire  political development perhaps till now
pBWp7sZG66o,40469436,40475756,we haven't seen an official involvement  on uh  the political drama in maharashtra but  this perhaps could be one of the major
pBWp7sZG66o,40475756,40482320,developments and major meeting that  would decide on in which direction is  the political crisis in maharashtra is
pBWp7sZG66o,40482320,40489436,heading for the benefit of our viewers  yes then we might just see some more  development  while we cannot confirm if there was a
pBWp7sZG66o,40489436,40496000,meeting directly between all these three  natas but we can confirm here in india  today that late last night home minister
pBWp7sZG66o,40496000,40501596,amit shah as you can see some of the  visuals will be right there on your  screen was in vadodara yesterday at
pBWp7sZG66o,40501596,40510400,about till midnight there was also  devendra farnavis who's the former chief  minister of maharashtra he's a bjp  nether and so was rebel mla not shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,40510400,40515756,who's leading this group of 40 mlas and  kamla sutar is telling us more about  that but
pBWp7sZG66o,40515756,40522720,everyone is also wondering the clock is  ticking  so either the ignition they group or the  bjp which has maximum number in the
pBWp7sZG66o,40522720,40527752,state assembly will likely will have to  make the next move
pBWp7sZG66o,40528960,40534320,indeed indeed and what initially was  happening what we saw pooja is that  uddav takri was maintaining a strike
pBWp7sZG66o,40534320,40540480,silence either he didn't attack ikna  chinde or he was taking a back seat  making only appeals to the rebel camp to
pBWp7sZG66o,40540480,40546320,come back uh sit across the table and  discuss but since last two days we've  seen suddenly the ship saying has become
pBWp7sZG66o,40546320,40552000,aggressive buddha started meeting people  the moment he left varsha came back to  his residence mata shri shiv seniors are
pBWp7sZG66o,40552000,40557116,taking to the streets udav takara is  aggressively addressing his party  leaders even aditya takra is doing that
pBWp7sZG66o,40557116,40562960,so the shivsena has suddenly decided to  fight it back initially uh that may have  been part of their strategy but now udav
pBWp7sZG66o,40562960,40568800,takre uh is very vocal about the rebel  camp and is taking the meds on on one on  the political front udav takara is
pBWp7sZG66o,40568800,40575200,taking the camp and on the other hand  we're seeing the legal action that has  been taken  by shiv sena and the mavica sagari has
pBWp7sZG66o,40575200,40581436,also gained momentum notices are being  issued for disqualification of the mlas  also other politic other legal
pBWp7sZG66o,40581436,40587436,formalities are being completed here  before the rebel camp can go and claim a  separate group before that happens uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40587436,40592640,they are they are seeing to it that the  mls the rebel groups a section of the  mlas will be disqualified so that it
pBWp7sZG66o,40592640,40598480,doesn't go uh to a certain point where  they will uh claim that the government  is a minority and may come and meet here
pBWp7sZG66o,40598480,40604560,in uh meet the governor of maharashtra  this is all happening this is a  developing news it's all dynamic so any
pBWp7sZG66o,40604560,40610080,moment anything can happen and perhaps  the meeting last night could have could  have been the decider on what the next
pBWp7sZG66o,40610080,40616400,step of the rebel camp is going to be  we'll just have to maybe wait uh uh it  for some a couple of days maybe when we
pBWp7sZG66o,40616400,40622560,can see some more action some concrete  steps been taken by the  shinde camp so now let me take you
pBWp7sZG66o,40622560,40628960,through to my colleague ankit kumar and  ankit was very interestingly tracking  those aircrafts it appeared to be a
pBWp7sZG66o,40628960,40636400,secret visit but ankit was tracking at  what time did which flight uh  flew from gohati and then landed in
pBWp7sZG66o,40636400,40642880,vadodara ankit do tell us the latest  about what did you exactly pick up from  how you were tracking these aircrafts
pBWp7sZG66o,40642880,40649116,and how we have now the confirmation  about these chartered planes that did go  from guhati to vardar and back to
pBWp7sZG66o,40649116,40656160,guwahati by morning  well uh it all started with a flight  that took off yesterday evening and
pBWp7sZG66o,40656160,40662160,reached  at around 8.  it was a  cessna class
pBWp7sZG66o,40662160,40668080,private jet it stayed at guadiaire for  about two hours around 10 20 10 20
pBWp7sZG66o,40668080,40673756,evening yesterday  it took off  from guwahati landed at delhi airport
pBWp7sZG66o,40673756,40679756,around 20 30 past midnight and  something very interesting happened  because
pBWp7sZG66o,40679756,40685040,if not cindy wanted to fly straight from  guwahati to
pBWp7sZG66o,40685040,40691360,check the adod was good enough to take  one person  uh  from guwahati
pBWp7sZG66o,40691360,40696880,but  that just landed at delhi airport there  was another jet another private jet at
pBWp7sZG66o,40696880,40704800,this time under south fargo class falcon  within a span of 15 minutes that just
pBWp7sZG66o,40704800,40709840,took off from new delhi it landed  at the same time there was another jet
pBWp7sZG66o,40709840,40715724,waiting that had traveled all the way  from mumbai why is
pBWp7sZG66o,40726320,40732880,several minutes the flight that came  from delhi did only about 30 minutes  then it went back to delhi
pBWp7sZG66o,40732880,40739596,in the morning at around between four  and uh four and four fifteen  yet one from one i had came from uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40739596,40745200,mumbai via indore it flew back to indore  then it came back to mumbai and another
pBWp7sZG66o,40745200,40751436,a new deck earlier party  that jet was due by was supposedly used  by ignition to fly that straight to
pBWp7sZG66o,40751436,40758560,gohani so  at least four private business class  jets are used for this secret meeting uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40758560,40764000,that now file comes interesting what  you're telling us  that this was this possibly could not
pBWp7sZG66o,40764000,40769840,just have been a direct flight it went  via different cities including the  national capital delhi but this also
pBWp7sZG66o,40769840,40775116,means that if at all there was a meeting  that did take place it lasted for barely  three hours because what you're telling
pBWp7sZG66o,40775116,40782720,us it landed in vadodara at about 1am  and then again left for gohati at about  4 am all of these were private jets and
pBWp7sZG66o,40782720,40788720,chartered aircrafts  it was precise 2 hours 30 minutes 2  hours
pBWp7sZG66o,40788720,40795040,not more than that because  that was all the time that those jets  had so it was
pBWp7sZG66o,40795040,40800960,relatively a brief meeting if you are  thinking about a political high stake  game uh what is important is that there
pBWp7sZG66o,40800960,40808720,was also brief stoppage at indoors so  there must have been somebody very  important who would have uh taken that
pBWp7sZG66o,40808720,40813840,uh debt from indoor and then that person  had to be both at hindus and similarly
pBWp7sZG66o,40813840,40820000,there must have been somebody from delhi  because because cinder did not have to  uh land at delhi and did not have to
pBWp7sZG66o,40820000,40826400,change a flight back to delhi because  that death did not take him back to  gohati for governor he had another jet
pBWp7sZG66o,40826400,40831520,meeting  airport so there were there must have  been different characters we don't know
pBWp7sZG66o,40831520,40838160,who but there must have been different  high profile characters  waiting from indoor from delhi who
pBWp7sZG66o,40838160,40844480,attended that meeting  and i can and want to tell our viewers  that uh i can assure you no other
pBWp7sZG66o,40844480,40850960,channel has this precise information  that ankit kumar is breaking for us here  on india today remember this is not just
pBWp7sZG66o,40850960,40857756,about eight nation they likely growing  from guwahati to vadodara which aircraft  which aircraft was taken at what time
pBWp7sZG66o,40857756,40864000,which aircraft was taken at what time  and landed where and then again took off  perhaps reflects of there were
pBWp7sZG66o,40864000,40870640,definitely high profile individuals who  were flying in and out of gohan in and  out of delhi and in and out of
pBWp7sZG66o,40870640,40875680,midnight this happened after 12 a.m last  night and by 4 am everything was sorted
pBWp7sZG66o,40875680,40881756,4 am ankit just to specify again 4 am  akra chin they possibly again takes this
pBWp7sZG66o,40881756,40888240,aircraft and lands in goharty by early  morning  uh 4 10
pBWp7sZG66o,40888240,40897596,for 4 10 in the morning he reaches  guardi back at uh land from somewhere  about about 7 am earlier today so uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40897596,40902880,and that was a a very different yet that  just has not we have been calculating we
pBWp7sZG66o,40902880,40910480,have been  maintaining a list of private jets used  during entire maharashtra political  prices so far we have contacted 11 jets
pBWp7sZG66o,40910480,40916960,11 private jets uh including one boeing  737 that was um by from filezilla apart
pBWp7sZG66o,40916960,40922800,from that  10  small business class debt so the total  number of
pBWp7sZG66o,40922800,40930400,private jets chartered yet that they are  speaking about during this maharashtra  politics wise devices is now 11 11
pBWp7sZG66o,40930400,40938000,imagine and at least four of them were  used yesterday so you can understand the  gravity the importance of that meeting
pBWp7sZG66o,40938000,40944320,the must have been very important if i  may ask you here for for someone who's  listening to you right now and we are
pBWp7sZG66o,40944320,40950800,breaking down one by one of the city  interchange uh the travel time why do  you think it's precisely the reason that
pBWp7sZG66o,40950800,40956640,it wouldn't be a direct uh chartered  aircraft from one city to another but  goes through different cities and in a
pBWp7sZG66o,40956640,40962640,short span of time it has managed to  cover three cities the exact time all of  this needs a lot of coordination but is
pBWp7sZG66o,40962640,40968400,this also reflecting that these are not  perhaps random individuals they are  definitely high profile they have a
pBWp7sZG66o,40968400,40973520,profile that required all of this  coordination  well uh
pBWp7sZG66o,40973520,40979436,we have we have been seen to a lot of  industry insiders the aviation sector  insiders and that
pBWp7sZG66o,40979436,40985116,we have also brought a story on how much  does it cost to hire one of these okay
pBWp7sZG66o,40985116,40991916,so  let's let's just set the record state no  no uh common person can hire those debts
pBWp7sZG66o,40991916,40997520,the prices are too high if you take into  account the route neither
pBWp7sZG66o,40997520,41003840,nor in god nor neither nor  these are not positioned places where
pBWp7sZG66o,41003840,41011596,these debts are positioned so if in case  you need a jet in gohani you will have  to ask that just to fly from a
pBWp7sZG66o,41011596,41020080,metropolitan city like chennai or  bangalore now that adds to the fall so  it can go up to 40 to 50 lakh rupees uh
pBWp7sZG66o,41020080,41026480,these deaths are flying at a very odd  time so 3 a.m 4 a.m those are not you
pBWp7sZG66o,41026480,41032400,know uh  those are not general traffic general  business signing one am today i'm kind
pBWp7sZG66o,41032400,41038960,of like  besides that we are also cooperating a  lot of information that we are getting  from our political reporters in gohani
pBWp7sZG66o,41038960,41045840,our mumbai dealership roshi he broke  this information that developer  partnership was seen
pBWp7sZG66o,41045840,41050960,his car was still moving towards airport  last night and then our uh hero chief
pBWp7sZG66o,41050960,41057360,olympian he confirmed that the car that  was used by sunday in gohani that was  people moving towards
pBWp7sZG66o,41057360,41063436,the airport yesterday evening so apart  from the open source data that we are  receiving from open source flight
pBWp7sZG66o,41063436,41070080,tracking that's right we are also  connecting a lot of political insights  that we are getting from our reporters  and then we are coming up with these uh
pBWp7sZG66o,41070080,41076720,additional details foreign  so what ankit kumar is explaining i'll
pBWp7sZG66o,41076720,41083200,briefly help our viewers to understand  that this is one about open source  tracking software that was used and akit
pBWp7sZG66o,41083200,41088240,kumar has been proficient in it ensuring  that what nobody else is focusing on we
pBWp7sZG66o,41088240,41093276,can bring you this other angle that  actually breaks down what could have  happened late last night apart from the
pBWp7sZG66o,41093276,41098480,other reporters on the ground also  corroborating  information about the vehicles that were
pBWp7sZG66o,41098480,41105116,seen in different cities about how  important that was in reference to these  big nethers you see on your screen so uh
pBWp7sZG66o,41105116,41112400,ankit we also have the confirmation that  there was not only iknack shinde who was  in madodra there was also devadavez
pBWp7sZG66o,41112400,41118080,there was also home minister amit shah  too much of a coincidence of course we  do not have the clarity of all three of
pBWp7sZG66o,41118080,41124240,them met but at least all three of them  were in vadodara has been confirmed
pBWp7sZG66o,41125436,41130480,that's right and that's what we are  trying to uh make sense of although of  course we do not have a confirmation on
pBWp7sZG66o,41130480,41135520,whether or not alexa was part of this  meeting or not because that has not been  confirmed from political sources but
pBWp7sZG66o,41135520,41142720,what we can conclusively say is that at  least four very important people from  four different cities that is kohati
pBWp7sZG66o,41142720,41148960,delhi indoor and mumbai they for some  very important reasons decided to meet
pBWp7sZG66o,41148960,41154960,in vadodara for two hours to discuss  something that must have been very  important because it was between two and
pBWp7sZG66o,41154960,41160320,four am in the um in late night or early  morning and all of them then had to go
pBWp7sZG66o,41160320,41165680,back to  original places the daily flight went  back just after half an hour the 40
pBWp7sZG66o,41165680,41172240,flight has you know uh landed at seven  the mumbai flight uh took off from roll  back around four so
pBWp7sZG66o,41172240,41178240,public forget that confirmed these  patterns our reporters on ground they  are confirming the movement of their
pBWp7sZG66o,41178240,41183360,leaders so definitely  is now the new uh center of this uh
pBWp7sZG66o,41183360,41191800,political crisis that has been happening  in maharashtra uh surat has not maruti  is now and let's dive in
pBWp7sZG66o,41202800,41208480,now from mumbai uh accommodates this  open source intelligence to gather more  data about what precisely was happening
pBWp7sZG66o,41208480,41214400,with these flights is very interesting  and then gets corroborated about the  nethers being in these respective cities
pBWp7sZG66o,41214400,41221916,and we are talking about three important  nethers to be in one location at the  same uh time in one city of vadodara and
pBWp7sZG66o,41221916,41227916,that perhaps could be a you know a  signal of what is happening because  why would home minister amit shah
pBWp7sZG66o,41227916,41233360,devendra ford former cm top bjp neta  with regard to maharashtra and iknow
pBWp7sZG66o,41233360,41239520,be in the same city and possibly  ignacion they're doing this travel in  midnight and is back by 6 30
pBWp7sZG66o,41239520,41245436,in gohati  well in fact you know puja i was just
pBWp7sZG66o,41245436,41251040,speaking to some of the rebel mls who  are in guwahati and even some of them  were not aware of any such meeting even
pBWp7sZG66o,41251040,41256480,they were not aware that akna china went  out of the hotel okay that's very  strange uh the kind of secrecy that is
pBWp7sZG66o,41256480,41263276,being maintained even in the rebel camp  that most of them i was trying to  corroborate that every uh you know  situation with them but most of them uh
pBWp7sZG66o,41263276,41269840,who on the condition of anonymity were  telling me even they were not aware that  any such meeting happened they thought  that ignacinda was there because they
pBWp7sZG66o,41269840,41276000,met him last night and in the early  morning they saw him again in the hotel  so even they were not aware of any such  meeting or ignacion they're going out of
pBWp7sZG66o,41276000,41281680,the hotel and going to border and  meeting uh they when the pharma is there  possibly so that was the kind of secrecy
pBWp7sZG66o,41281680,41288560,that is being maintained now obviously  the reason behind this uh is uh the  shinde camp and both uh in case there is
pBWp7sZG66o,41288560,41295520,any uh bjp involvement into this or  backing or the maha shakti that uh  is referring to if that is uh in play at
pBWp7sZG66o,41295520,41300640,this point then that would certainly  signal at some big developments that we  can expect in another couple of days
pBWp7sZG66o,41300640,41306320,what are the options before the shin  they come either they approach the  governor yes uh to uh to withdraw  support of the government saying that
pBWp7sZG66o,41306320,41311840,the government is a minority or also  they could approach the court saying  that the disqualification of initiated
pBWp7sZG66o,41311840,41317916,by the deputy speaker is illegal okay  there are certain steps that the shinde  group is going to take but uh as we saw
pBWp7sZG66o,41317916,41323596,this afternoon they were mooting an idea  to float a separate group called  and that is being so keeping all options
pBWp7sZG66o,41323596,41328960,open  is keeping all doors also open in case
pBWp7sZG66o,41328960,41334880,these rebel mlas want to return but  remember india today not only with open  source intelligence but also our
pBWp7sZG66o,41334880,41342720,reporters on the ground telling you  about precisely what did happen late  last night between gohati and vadodara

pBWp7sZG66o,41349116,41354560,suthar for the latest on that so amid  this ongoing uh tussle in the state of  maharashtra the question is will the
pBWp7sZG66o,41354560,41361116,real chef senator stand up because not  shinde is very confident says they are  pushing to name a new splinter group or
pBWp7sZG66o,41361116,41368800,even a rebel party and they will want to  name it shiv senna bala sahib uda  tafkray says do not use my father's name
pBWp7sZG66o,41368800,41377040,use your own father if you want to  because shiv sena and tag rays are  synonymous take a look at this report

pBWp7sZG66o,41394240,41401436,this raging political mahabharata has  now entered a legal battleground  both chief minister udav takrei and
pBWp7sZG66o,41401436,41409476,rebel eknatch  are staking claim as the rightful heir  of shift
pBWp7sZG66o,41413200,41415840,night
pBWp7sZG66o,41432080,41437436,one thing is clear a split in shift sena  is now inevitably
pBWp7sZG66o,41437436,41445520,shinde and 37 mlas have broken drag from  the uddhav sena they are now the  majority leaving the original shift cena
pBWp7sZG66o,41445520,41450560,to be reduced to a minority party  and now
pBWp7sZG66o,41450560,41457040,shinde sena is moving in for the kill by  laying claim to the bow

pBWp7sZG66o,42401756,42407756,of the top leaders of the bjp in  maharashtra  left from mumbai post 9 pm in a private
pBWp7sZG66o,42407756,42415596,jet to vadodra via indore and is back in  mumbai by morning so mumbai to vadodra
pBWp7sZG66o,42415596,42423840,for devendra farnaways and gohati to  vadodra for eknath shinde
pBWp7sZG66o,42424560,42430560,let's go across quickly to my colleague  manish pandey who's tracking all the  latest on this from mumbai munich very
pBWp7sZG66o,42430560,42436160,interesting india today is tracking all  the latest on this from our open source  intelligence also corroborating the
pBWp7sZG66o,42436160,42442320,information by our reporters on the  ground but this was a secret huddle if  at all there was but therefore
pBWp7sZG66o,42442320,42450520,definitely a secret visit by akana cindy  you know to suddenly go from guwahati  all the way to vadra
pBWp7sZG66o,42450692,42456240,[Music]  uh indeed this is very interesting and
pBWp7sZG66o,42456240,42462640,what we can confirm to our viewers uh  based on the information we are getting  from our sources is that
pBWp7sZG66o,42462640,42469756,david farneville's left from mumbai  around nine o'clock post nine o'clock  and then he went to indore from indore
pBWp7sZG66o,42469756,42475360,he went to vadodara and around six am  this morning he was back
pBWp7sZG66o,42475360,42480720,he was back to  mumbai whether there was any meeting or  not there is no official confirmation
pBWp7sZG66o,42480720,42487116,but since the time this entire  you know drama is happening in  maharashtra the political drama where
pBWp7sZG66o,42487116,42492480,eknashinde is  with the rebel
pBWp7sZG66o,42492960,42500000,but certainly there have been some sort  of  communication within the bharti janta
pBWp7sZG66o,42500000,42506560,party officially not even the bjp not  even the  rebel emilias of shivsena have
pBWp7sZG66o,42506560,42512720,told any media channel or any in any  other way that they are going to make an
pBWp7sZG66o,42512720,42519276,alliance post alliance they are going to  do any alliance but certainly some talks  are happening and this is a clear
pBWp7sZG66o,42519276,42525116,indication where uh  iknow shinde flew from guwahati he he
pBWp7sZG66o,42525116,42531276,went to vadodara and what we are  understanding is that even david farnawz  was in vadodara
pBWp7sZG66o,42531276,42537840,during the same period  in the same night it is also interesting  to mention here monish that till now
pBWp7sZG66o,42537840,42544720,devein rafat navis or the bhartiya  janata party have distanced themselves  from any involvement or even interest in
pBWp7sZG66o,42544720,42551436,what is unfolding team modi did give its  first reaction devendra nova said  earlier said have you ever seen any such
pBWp7sZG66o,42551436,42556800,coalition last even two years so all of  that is in perspective but for these
pBWp7sZG66o,42556800,42563596,nethers to be in the same city at the  same time is definitely going to catch  many of gardens specifically udav takre
pBWp7sZG66o,42563596,42569112,for this information to reach him has to  ring alarm bells
pBWp7sZG66o,42572640,42579520,absolutely puja and  since the time this entire drama  unfolded the official line of bjp is
pBWp7sZG66o,42579520,42585520,that they are monitoring the situation  today i was outside they went for novice  residents and what we saw that they were
pBWp7sZG66o,42585520,42591756,mlas coming and meeting them in the ford  novice there were senior leaders of bjp  coming and meeting their infarna base at
pBWp7sZG66o,42591756,42597200,the very same time there was an  interesting press conference by a rebel  mla of uh
pBWp7sZG66o,42597200,42602800,ignacio in the faction and  that  in that press conference it was
pBWp7sZG66o,42602800,42608320,told to the media that  they are still in shiv sena they are the
pBWp7sZG66o,42608320,42614400,shifts and ex and they will make an  alliance they will form a government but  they will not form a government uh with
pBWp7sZG66o,42614400,42621200,uh  ncp or congress party they are  fighting for hindutva so already there
pBWp7sZG66o,42621200,42628080,are enough indications that this  alliance may be formed between ikna  shinde factionship cena and bharti janta
pBWp7sZG66o,42628080,42633596,party but certainly it won't happen in  one night there must be some  communication there must be some
pBWp7sZG66o,42633596,42638880,negativity  either too much of a coincidence or
pBWp7sZG66o,42638880,42644160,could be a reflection of what's  unfolding behind closed doors but we can  confirm to you that they've individuals
pBWp7sZG66o,42644160,42650240,and also  both back to their respective cities by
pBWp7sZG66o,42650240,42655360,morning manish pandey is in mumbai all  our reporters will be tracking the  latest both from goatee and mumbai on
