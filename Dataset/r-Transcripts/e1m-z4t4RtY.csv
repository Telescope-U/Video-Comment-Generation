e1m-z4t4RtY,40719,43040,there is no orange on any of you i'm
e1m-z4t4RtY,43040,44800,looking around i don't spot any but the
e1m-z4t4RtY,44800,46879,combos look clean the backplates don't
e1m-z4t4RtY,46879,48800,really fit the theme of the movie they
e1m-z4t4RtY,48800,50399,fit the skins though i'll give it a
e1m-z4t4RtY,50399,53120,solid six out of ten oh tanner's up next

e1m-z4t4RtY,61840,63920,combo looks like you guys used a few
e1m-z4t4RtY,63920,65840,things from uh the same set looks like
e1m-z4t4RtY,65840,67600,they're supposed to go together but i do
e1m-z4t4RtY,67600,69360,like that this stuff actually matches

e1m-z4t4RtY,79840,81439,like they belong with the ghostbusters
e1m-z4t4RtY,81439,82960,the pickaxes match that's pretty
e1m-z4t4RtY,82960,84560,creative i think it's more creative than

e1m-z4t4RtY,536560,538320,me what you guys got all right so this
e1m-z4t4RtY,538320,540320,looks like in the movie when the toys
e1m-z4t4RtY,540320,542480,were hiding in the cone which is pretty
e1m-z4t4RtY,542480,544160,creative i do like that so they got to
e1m-z4t4RtY,544160,546160,go across the road for sure yeah looks
e1m-z4t4RtY,546160,547440,like they're just trying to make it past
e1m-z4t4RtY,547440,548959,these cars that are getting launched
e1m-z4t4RtY,548959,550080,that is really creative really
e1m-z4t4RtY,550080,551279,interesting oh and it looks like they're
e1m-z4t4RtY,551279,553200,going to big al's toy barn i remember

e1m-z4t4RtY,572000,573760,solid seven out of ten all right so we
e1m-z4t4RtY,573760,575440,have the cars team here this is pretty
e1m-z4t4RtY,575440,576880,sick looking already we got lightning

e1m-z4t4RtY,583360,584880,come on come on come on so it looks like
e1m-z4t4RtY,584880,586560,this is gonna be the race between the
e1m-z4t4RtY,586560,587680,three of them and we got lightning
e1m-z4t4RtY,587680,589200,mcqueen in the front of course because
e1m-z4t4RtY,589200,591600,he's the best driver that's awesome and
e1m-z4t4RtY,591600,593440,chick hicks is out in the back dude this
e1m-z4t4RtY,593440,594800,is actually really sick and it looks

e1m-z4t4RtY,602160,603600,at the finish line the chick hicks wins
e1m-z4t4RtY,603600,605040,of course he's probably celebrating over
e1m-z4t4RtY,605040,606640,there he's excited but lightning mcqueen
e1m-z4t4RtY,606640,608240,the nice guy that he is he's going to be
e1m-z4t4RtY,608240,610399,pushing the dinoco guy all the way to
e1m-z4t4RtY,610399,612079,the finish line this is probably the
e1m-z4t4RtY,612079,613839,best part of the movie so this is pretty
e1m-z4t4RtY,613839,615600,freaking cool we're doing the infamous
