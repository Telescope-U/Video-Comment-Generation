zV1O6R9ezeo,680,6879,[Music]  let's say you're miserable and unhappy  okay here's a cure
zV1O6R9ezeo,6879,12880,find what's valuable and  let it go  so we could say well maybe it's a
zV1O6R9ezeo,12880,19359,relationship that you have  and you're suffering terribly because of  it  well what do you do
zV1O6R9ezeo,19359,26400,maybe you let it go it's a sacrifice  and the idea is that well that'll clear  the future for you
zV1O6R9ezeo,27439,33040,you're not great until you release  greatness into someone else
zV1O6R9ezeo,33040,39520,the ability to recognize and relate  to  to see someone and release greatness in
zV1O6R9ezeo,39520,45559,them and through them is a true  characteristic of greatness
zV1O6R9ezeo,46000,51360,if you're not careful you'll minimize  try to equalize
zV1O6R9ezeo,51360,59840,but one of the greatest things you can  do is find someone and pour into them  that's a sign of greatness
zV1O6R9ezeo,62640,68400,if potential  is not what you've done but what you  could do
zV1O6R9ezeo,68400,74400,then whatever you've done is no longer  your potential therefore you should  never be impressed by what you've done
zV1O6R9ezeo,74400,80000,because if you are impressed by what  you've done is stop you from doing what  you could do  [Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,80000,86758,the greatest enemy of progress is your  last success
zV1O6R9ezeo,88080,96320,you've lived a life dominated by doubt  and fear  how do you step into bravery
zV1O6R9ezeo,98880,106159,step  that's how you step into bravery step
zV1O6R9ezeo,106159,112720,take  the step  step  aggressively
zV1O6R9ezeo,112720,119920,towards your fear  ladies and gentlemen everything matters
zV1O6R9ezeo,119920,125920,and you know you're somebody  you know  i rather lose
zV1O6R9ezeo,125920,131440,out on my dream  doing the right thing  in the chief
zV1O6R9ezeo,131440,138160,trying to make a shortcut to get to my  goal i want to be able to look myself in  the mirror that's what you want to do
zV1O6R9ezeo,138160,144560,[Music]  there's no saying judge a man not by  what he does but by that that he doesn't  have to do and the judge the true
zV1O6R9ezeo,144560,152879,quality of a man is what he do when  nobody's looking  he's got long-term plans for your life
zV1O6R9ezeo,152879,158800,and for your generation  he's got  a
zV1O6R9ezeo,158800,164160,a magnificent plan  it may feel hard where you're at right
zV1O6R9ezeo,164160,170000,now  you may feel discouraged and you may  feel like giving up because it seems
zV1O6R9ezeo,170000,177179,like  that all you feel is weariness  [Applause]
zV1O6R9ezeo,177920,184400,here's the point  opposition escalates with opportunity
zV1O6R9ezeo,184400,191840,and that means you have not peaked yet  that means that your greatest days are
zV1O6R9ezeo,191840,197760,not behind you they absolutely i tell  you with 100
zV1O6R9ezeo,197760,204640,confidence you have not peaked yet  your greatest days are in your future
zV1O6R9ezeo,204640,207760,not in your past
zV1O6R9ezeo,210879,216159,and that  that step towards your fear is the step
zV1O6R9ezeo,216159,221519,into bravery  because we we're
zV1O6R9ezeo,221519,227680,we're scared of what we don't know  and
zV1O6R9ezeo,227680,233680,there is only one way  to learn  and to know
zV1O6R9ezeo,233680,239519,and that is to confront that fear  good out there for you in the universe
zV1O6R9ezeo,239519,246480,that has your name on it and nobody can  get your good  it has your name on it they can't take
zV1O6R9ezeo,246480,251760,your stuff it's your stuff  so when you know that
zV1O6R9ezeo,251760,258239,when you know that whatever you're  seeking it's also seeking you  you don't worry
zV1O6R9ezeo,258239,263360,you don't run scared  you don't think somebody's gonna take it  from you
zV1O6R9ezeo,263360,268400,you listen to your inner voice and you  always take the high road
zV1O6R9ezeo,268400,274360,there will be the tendency the natural  inclination to take the low road you  must resist that
zV1O6R9ezeo,274360,280800,[Music]  and with greater doors that will open
zV1O6R9ezeo,280800,288000,will come greater opposition than you've  ever experienced  and you've got to be soldiers
zV1O6R9ezeo,288000,294800,you've got to learn how to handle it  you've got to be able to deal with
zV1O6R9ezeo,294800,301360,running with the horses  you keep saying i want the big doors you  keep saying i want you to use me you
zV1O6R9ezeo,301360,307759,keep saying it what you're asking god  for is you want to run with the horses  you don't want to be down here you want
zV1O6R9ezeo,307759,316000,to be up here okay then with the bigger  doors comes greater opposite opposition
zV1O6R9ezeo,316160,321440,it's about  facing your fears
zV1O6R9ezeo,321440,326490,takes discipline to face your fears so  you can conquer them
zV1O6R9ezeo,326490,331919,[Music]  and that's what discipline is discipline
zV1O6R9ezeo,331919,337120,means taking the hard road the uphill  road to do what's right
zV1O6R9ezeo,337120,342639,for yourself  and for other people
zV1O6R9ezeo,342639,349039,60 years to put yourself together and  god only knows what you could become
zV1O6R9ezeo,349039,355759,and that's so  that message is so much more it's so  funny because it's so
zV1O6R9ezeo,355759,361759,it's such an attack  but it's so positive  because there's faith there in the in
zV1O6R9ezeo,361759,368000,the potential that makes up the person  rather than the miserable actuality that  happens to be manifesting itself at the
zV1O6R9ezeo,368000,373440,moment  [Music]  wherever you are in life ladies and
zV1O6R9ezeo,373440,378720,gentlemen you've got comeback power  i don't care how long you are i don't
zV1O6R9ezeo,378720,384639,care what you have done i don't care  what you have experienced i don't care  how devastated your life might appear to
zV1O6R9ezeo,384639,390800,be the shambles it might be in  there is a power in you that can enable
zV1O6R9ezeo,390800,397520,you to be stronger and better than  anything that's out here  [Applause]
zV1O6R9ezeo,397520,404400,it's so often the easy path  the easy path it calls to us
zV1O6R9ezeo,404400,409840,to be weak for that moment to break down  for that moment
zV1O6R9ezeo,409919,416720,to give in to the desire and the  short-term gratification
zV1O6R9ezeo,418000,424639,but the discipline will not allow that  the discipline calls for strength and
zV1O6R9ezeo,424639,430319,fortitude and will  constantly
zV1O6R9ezeo,430319,436080,know that you're not what you could be  to take responsibility for that and to
zV1O6R9ezeo,436080,442240,and to  commit yourself like body and soul to  the attainment of that
zV1O6R9ezeo,442240,445240,ideal
zV1O6R9ezeo,452560,457840,if an alarm clock goes off in the  morning and you ain't happy about it
zV1O6R9ezeo,457840,464240,you ain't doing what you want to do  see you fighting upstream you're going  against what god created you for if your
zV1O6R9ezeo,464240,470720,job makes you sick to go to  if you're unhappy with waking up to go
zV1O6R9ezeo,470720,475840,to where you got to go it's because you  ain't living in your gift
zV1O6R9ezeo,476319,482240,one can have no smaller or greater  mastery than mastery over oneself that's  da vinci
zV1O6R9ezeo,482240,488479,any moment you can choose to believe  something new about yourself now the  weird thing about belief is as soon as
zV1O6R9ezeo,488479,492919,you change that belief it becomes true
zV1O6R9ezeo,494560,501840,why pay the price  why work this hard  why go this far
zV1O6R9ezeo,501840,508160,why try to learn this much  why try to do it all
zV1O6R9ezeo,508160,514000,why try to see it all why try to have it  all  [Music]  why do it
zV1O6R9ezeo,514000,519518,why learn it why study why put yourself  out  why try to take on this much
zV1O6R9ezeo,519518,526240,responsibility  [Music]  that's a good question why
zV1O6R9ezeo,526240,533040,and you're the only one personally that  can answer that question for yourself  you've got to have your own list of whys
zV1O6R9ezeo,533040,538560,the why is powerful the how is easy
zV1O6R9ezeo,539200,545519,many people will leave the universe  without a trace  no one will know they were here and in
zV1O6R9ezeo,545519,550800,fact under their name we could put under  there not used up
zV1O6R9ezeo,552080,557200,will anybody know that you came this way  what contribution are you giving what
zV1O6R9ezeo,557200,562560,will you leave what will be different  because you came this way  someone
zV1O6R9ezeo,562560,568160,once said that life is our gift to us  that god has given us and how we live
zV1O6R9ezeo,568160,573600,our lives is our gift to god what kind  of gift are you formulating
zV1O6R9ezeo,573600,580320,have you tried everything  have you exhausted every possible option
zV1O6R9ezeo,580320,586640,scenario combination tool and approach  if the answer to any of these questions
zV1O6R9ezeo,586640,592720,is no then go back and try again because  if you don't because you don't truly  know if you can do something until
zV1O6R9ezeo,592720,599360,you've tried absolutely everything  a more accurate but more verbose way of
zV1O6R9ezeo,599360,604880,saying it would be  i don't care about or want enough this
zV1O6R9ezeo,604880,610959,task or the resultant benefits of it in  order to do all that is necessary to
zV1O6R9ezeo,610959,617279,achieve  [Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,617279,623200,if you want it be successful you got to  change your mind  and you're going to have to have some
zV1O6R9ezeo,623200,628399,faith  [Music]  i am here to tell you
zV1O6R9ezeo,628399,638579,that you can come from nothing  and become something  [Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,643760,649360,that you want to live like a warrior  and die a legend what do you mean by
zV1O6R9ezeo,649360,654880,that well  one of the first qualities  of a warrior
zV1O6R9ezeo,654880,659920,is courage  you want to live your life from now on
zV1O6R9ezeo,659920,667120,with courage  that most people take their talents  abilities and skills to the grave with
zV1O6R9ezeo,667120,674160,them because of a lack of courage  and courage is not the the lack of fear
zV1O6R9ezeo,674160,683040,courage is the willingness to do what it  is you need to do what you are called to  do in spite of the fear
zV1O6R9ezeo,683519,689600,everybody in your life will have a turn  back moment  no matter who you are
zV1O6R9ezeo,689600,694959,you're going to have  such a period in your life where it  seems like it's not working you're going
zV1O6R9ezeo,694959,700640,to have doubts you're going to have a  lot of trials and tribulations and  challenges and everybody has what's
zV1O6R9ezeo,700640,707519,called the turn back  you always have a moment in your life  where the direction you're going you
zV1O6R9ezeo,707519,715519,will have to make a decision to keep  going or you turn back  the sad thing is the average person
zV1O6R9ezeo,715519,722320,turns back  but if the why isn't strong
zV1O6R9ezeo,722320,729040,if your goals aren't powerful  if the vision isn't clear the old  prophet said without a vision we die
zV1O6R9ezeo,729040,734000,without a vision we perish without a  dream we're nothing
zV1O6R9ezeo,735279,741920,i don't need you to believe that you're  good now that doesn't matter who you are  now is totally irrelevant  the only thing i want to know who are
zV1O6R9ezeo,741920,747120,you willing to become and what's the  price you're willing to pay to get there  and that's what humans are designed to
zV1O6R9ezeo,747120,752320,do if you put us under stress  we can learn something new
zV1O6R9ezeo,752320,759680,we can get better  [Music]  train your physical strength and
zV1O6R9ezeo,759680,767120,exercise your mental strength by doing  the right things the hard things
zV1O6R9ezeo,767519,772880,the things you know you're supposed to  do
zV1O6R9ezeo,772880,779519,do that  and be as strong as you can mentally
zV1O6R9ezeo,779519,786399,physically and emotionally for yourself  for your team
zV1O6R9ezeo,786399,792000,for your family  hold the line
zV1O6R9ezeo,792880,795680,and be strong
zV1O6R9ezeo,798160,803839,you must work on yourself continuously  never be satisfied with yourself always
zV1O6R9ezeo,803839,810320,know that as you invest the effort and  time on you that's the greatest ability  that human beings have above animals see
zV1O6R9ezeo,810320,818959,a dog can't be anything but a dog tree  can be anything but a tree human being  you've got unlimited potential
zV1O6R9ezeo,819839,825040,and my personal question to you is why  not
zV1O6R9ezeo,826839,832079,you let the sand in the glass  represent
zV1O6R9ezeo,832079,839040,your life  let the sand in the bottom of the glass  represent the past
zV1O6R9ezeo,839040,844240,the sand in the top of the glass will  represent the future
zV1O6R9ezeo,845199,850480,the nobler the aim  the better your life
zV1O6R9ezeo,850480,856880,if you don't have a noble aim then you  have nothing but but shallow  trivial
zV1O6R9ezeo,856880,862079,pleasures and they don't sustain you and  that's not good because because life is
zV1O6R9ezeo,862079,869440,so difficult so much it's so much  suffering it's so complex it ends and  everyone dies and it's painful it's like
zV1O6R9ezeo,869440,875600,without a noble aim how can you  withstand any of that you can't you  become desperate and once you become
zV1O6R9ezeo,875600,883040,desperate things go  things go from bad to worse very rapidly  [Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,883040,888480,all of us have within us this  amazing capacity to manifest and attract
zV1O6R9ezeo,888480,894240,anything that we want into our life so  how we call it what what words that we
zV1O6R9ezeo,894240,899600,use we have to be able to say  you you get what you want you know and
zV1O6R9ezeo,899600,905600,what is missing  is that you you say  i will attract into my life what i am
zV1O6R9ezeo,905600,912810,not what i want  and i am capable of attracting all  things that  that the source is capable of attracting
zV1O6R9ezeo,912810,918320,[Music]  the sand in the bottom of glass
zV1O6R9ezeo,918320,923600,represents the past everything that has  happened right up to this moment in your  life
zV1O6R9ezeo,923600,929040,has been absolutely essential to make  you the person you are
zV1O6R9ezeo,929040,936079,to prepare you to do whatever it is  you're going to do  i'm of the opinion that we never really
zV1O6R9ezeo,936079,942160,know what we're preparing ourselves for  but if we're using the right ideas
zV1O6R9ezeo,942160,948480,we can be absolutely certain  it's something great  [Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,948480,954399,we're not taught to love ourselves  we're not taught to look out for  ourselves we're not taught to take care
zV1O6R9ezeo,954399,960399,of ourselves to become sensitive to our  wants to our needs our desires
zV1O6R9ezeo,960399,967199,so make a conscious effort make you  number one priority  your peace of mind your health is more
zV1O6R9ezeo,967199,972560,important than your family and any and  everybody because if you don't have  peace of mind if you don't have your
zV1O6R9ezeo,972560,978240,health you can't serve anybody don't  neglect yourself
zV1O6R9ezeo,979600,985360,your life guys it's not about making  money  it's not about having the titles
zV1O6R9ezeo,985360,990480,[Music]  your life is about a moment to come
zV1O6R9ezeo,990480,995519,it's inevitable we cannot stop if you're  coming right now we have the most
zV1O6R9ezeo,995519,1000720,valuable asset on earth on our side time  but it's running out
zV1O6R9ezeo,1000720,1006000,and right now you guys are sitting there  and to make that first step towards  greatness
zV1O6R9ezeo,1006000,1011040,is the hardest step  but there is one thing harder than that  my friends
zV1O6R9ezeo,1011040,1018240,it's later in life  as you look back on your life the  windows of opportunity has closed
zV1O6R9ezeo,1018240,1025480,your ability is no longer present  and you think back that you could have  been great
zV1O6R9ezeo,1027199,1033918,the knowledge that you have emerged  wiser and stronger from setbacks means  that you are ever after secure in your
zV1O6R9ezeo,1033918,1040720,ability to survive  you will never truly know yourself  or the strength of your relationships
zV1O6R9ezeo,1040720,1047199,until both have been tested by adversity  such knowledge is a true gift
zV1O6R9ezeo,1047199,1052400,for all that it is painfully won  and it has been worth more than any  qualification
zV1O6R9ezeo,1052400,1059039,i ever earned  that personal happiness lies in knowing  that life is not a checklist of
zV1O6R9ezeo,1059039,1064080,acquisition or achievement  your qualifications your cv
zV1O6R9ezeo,1064080,1069840,are not your life  life is difficult and complicated and
zV1O6R9ezeo,1069840,1077990,beyond anyone's total control  and the humility to know that will  enable you to survive its vicissitudes
zV1O6R9ezeo,1077990,1089690,[Music]
zV1O6R9ezeo,1097120,1102720,and and we can  thrive  under the difficult conditions that make
zV1O6R9ezeo,1102720,1108080,up our lives and we can resist the  malevolence that entices us that's
zV1O6R9ezeo,1108080,1114400,within our power  and we don't know the limits to that and  we also know that
zV1O6R9ezeo,1114400,1119919,it's better  to  we all know this
zV1O6R9ezeo,1119919,1126000,that it's better  to live  courageously  than cowardly
zV1O6R9ezeo,1126000,1132240,i know that it's better to live  truthfully than in deceit  and you can tell that too because that's
zV1O6R9ezeo,1132240,1137520,also what you tell people that you love  and we know that you should
zV1O6R9ezeo,1137520,1143760,pick up your damn responsibility  and move forward
zV1O6R9ezeo,1144640,1149679,the top of the glass represents the  future there's absolutely no way that
zV1O6R9ezeo,1149679,1155120,any of us can tell how much sand there  is in the top of our glass
zV1O6R9ezeo,1155120,1161840,and to spend your time  focusing on the past  is to spend the only thing that you've
zV1O6R9ezeo,1161840,1167760,got and that's what's right here right  now because the sand never stops running
zV1O6R9ezeo,1170400,1176240,as naseem tele says things that are  robust that are strong that are tough
zV1O6R9ezeo,1176240,1183200,that can take just a lot of abuse before  they break they are still ultimately  defined by their breaking point
zV1O6R9ezeo,1183200,1189919,something that is anti-fragile on the  other hand is something that the more  you attack it the more it is pounded on
zV1O6R9ezeo,1189919,1195200,the stronger it gets  now imagine being able to build
zV1O6R9ezeo,1195200,1201919,a belief system  the thing that you build your  self-esteem around if all of that
zV1O6R9ezeo,1201919,1207919,we're tied to something that is truly  anti-fragile that the more somebody  comes after it the more robust it

zV1O6R9ezeo,1914399,1919919,and then you got warriors  right they walk outside the wind hits  them knocks them down they pick up their
zV1O6R9ezeo,1919919,1926559,stuff they adjust and they get moving  and they deal with the adversity that  they didn't expect they set their  perspective right and they figure out a
zV1O6R9ezeo,1926559,1931919,way to embrace it and add value to every  environment that they go into in every  person's life that they come in contact

zV1O6R9ezeo,2155119,2159838,control that  like people are resilient
zV1O6R9ezeo,2160240,2166320,like resilient got the fortitude  like you put a goal in front of them  they'll smash it they'll chase it down
zV1O6R9ezeo,2166320,2172400,people are resilient  like when you put goals in front of them  they chase it resilient right and if

zV1O6R9ezeo,2188000,2194720,i relish it  that's what i'm gonna do  i'm gonna use it
zV1O6R9ezeo,2195680,2200720,you've got to be willing to change your  ways
zV1O6R9ezeo,2200720,2209200,your life is working if you don't like  what you have produced you're a director  you are the star you wrote this script
zV1O6R9ezeo,2209200,2214720,you produce this whatever it is if it's  a hit you produced it if it's a flop you
zV1O6R9ezeo,2214720,2220000,produced it take ownership of it and  decide to go back to the drawing board
zV1O6R9ezeo,2220000,2226560,and rewrite the script that you are the  star of  you have the power to do that
zV1O6R9ezeo,2226560,2232320,on this day you can declare  that i'm going to change
zV1O6R9ezeo,2232320,2238640,and so every single day with whatever  you do if it's football if it's bask  whatever the case may be every single
zV1O6R9ezeo,2238640,2245040,day when you do it before you approach  it ask yourself a question  like at the core i'm talking about with
zV1O6R9ezeo,2245040,2251200,conviction  say why do i really do it  but most importantly who am i really
zV1O6R9ezeo,2251200,2256290,doing it for  if i'm broken then i just found my  limitations
zV1O6R9ezeo,2256290,2262800,[Music]  and until  i know what my limitations are
zV1O6R9ezeo,2262800,2266359,how can i push
zV1O6R9ezeo,2270079,2275839,happiness is something that descends  upon you everyone knows that  you know it it
zV1O6R9ezeo,2275839,2282920,it comes upon you suddenly  and then you should be grateful for it
zV1O6R9ezeo,2286800,2294079,what you should be pursuing instead is  well there's two things is  you should be pursuing
zV1O6R9ezeo,2294079,2301520,who you could be  that'd be the first thing it's like  because you're not who you could be and  you know it you have guilt and shame and
zV1O6R9ezeo,2301520,2308160,and regret  and and  you berate yourself for your lack of  discipline and your procrastination and
zV1O6R9ezeo,2308160,2313760,all your bad habits you know perfectly  well that you're not who you could be  and god only knows who you could be and
zV1O6R9ezeo,2313760,2318880,so that's how you should be strive  that's what you should be  striving for
zV1O6R9ezeo,2318880,2325119,when you find yourself disappointed in  life when you find yourself coming up  short in life you can either complain
zV1O6R9ezeo,2325119,2332000,about it or you can choose to learn from  it  now come a firm believer that
zV1O6R9ezeo,2332000,2338720,i'm a firm believer that god redirects  and maneuvers us when he has us on a  mission
zV1O6R9ezeo,2338720,2345599,right and in the redirection i think  true courage is the ability to embrace  what we don't understand
zV1O6R9ezeo,2345920,2352640,because i know anybody can accept and  embrace something that they do  understand and that they know the end  result but i think true courage is when
zV1O6R9ezeo,2352640,2357680,you find yourself in the midst of  opposition piece of adversity or  situation and when you're in the midst
zV1O6R9ezeo,2357680,2364400,of it you're thinking man how did this  happen and how did i get here but you  still have a certain level of  perspective to say even though i don't
zV1O6R9ezeo,2364400,2370480,understand it even though i don't like  it i can still trust god even though i  can't trace god
zV1O6R9ezeo,2370480,2375520,because you're facing a disappointment  today  doesn't mean that you have to live
zV1O6R9ezeo,2375520,2380720,defeated  just because you're facing a  disappointment today doesn't have to let
zV1O6R9ezeo,2380720,2386000,you  believe that your whole entire destiny  is delayed and will never ever be
zV1O6R9ezeo,2386000,2393320,reached no life is going to have highs  and lows peaks and troughs
