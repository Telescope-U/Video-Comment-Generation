6BaVxigauek,880,3840,throughout the war in ukraine nato has
6BaVxigauek,3840,6319,towed a delicate line
6BaVxigauek,6319,8800,providing as many weapons to ukraine as
6BaVxigauek,8800,11599,it can without triggering a direct
6BaVxigauek,11599,14240,reaction from russia however with
6BaVxigauek,14240,16960,tensions between russia and lithuania
6BaVxigauek,16960,19520,rapidly escalating over lithuania's
6BaVxigauek,19520,21920,trade blockade of kaliningrad an
6BaVxigauek,21920,25599,escalation looks worryingly likely so in
6BaVxigauek,25599,27760,this video we're going to be explaining
6BaVxigauek,27760,30560,lithuania's kaliningrad embargo
6BaVxigauek,30560,33040,why russia is so mad about it and
6BaVxigauek,33040,35950,whether it could lead to world war three
6BaVxigauek,35950,39059,[Music]
6BaVxigauek,40960,43120,before we start a lot of our viewers
6BaVxigauek,43120,44719,don't actually know that we have other
6BaVxigauek,44719,47120,youtube channels you can find out much
6BaVxigauek,47120,48800,more news from us over our other
6BaVxigauek,48800,52960,channels tldr uk us and global subscribe
6BaVxigauek,52960,54640,to the ones you're interested in or
6BaVxigauek,54640,56879,subscribe to all of them to get the most
6BaVxigauek,56879,59680,from tldr they're linked below first
6BaVxigauek,59680,62000,things first a little primer on
6BaVxigauek,62000,64640,kaliningrad itself formerly the
6BaVxigauek,64640,67119,easternmost city of germany prior to the
6BaVxigauek,67119,70000,second world war the kaliningrad region
6BaVxigauek,70000,73360,was seized by the red army in 1945
6BaVxigauek,73360,75920,and then ceded to the soviet union after
6BaVxigauek,75920,78240,the war physically sandwiched between
6BaVxigauek,78240,81479,poland and lithuania kaliningrad is a
6BaVxigauek,81479,84479,semi-enclave of the russian federation
6BaVxigauek,84479,86400,i.e territory of russia
6BaVxigauek,86400,89280,with a sea border otherwise completely
6BaVxigauek,89280,92799,surrounded by territory of other states
6BaVxigauek,92799,96880,notably poland and lithuania kaliningrad
6BaVxigauek,96880,99439,is part of russia because when it was
6BaVxigauek,99439,101759,part of the soviet union while it was
6BaVxigauek,101759,104399,administered by the lithuanian soviet
6BaVxigauek,104399,107040,socialist republic the area was
6BaVxigauek,107040,110000,technically designated as part of the
6BaVxigauek,110000,112399,russia soviet federative socialist
6BaVxigauek,112399,115520,republic this is probably because stalin
6BaVxigauek,115520,118159,considered the area too strategically
6BaVxigauek,118159,120320,important to be left in the hands of
6BaVxigauek,120320,123600,another ssr while it was the easternmost
6BaVxigauek,123600,125840,region of germany it is now the
6BaVxigauek,125840,128479,westernmost region of russia and the
6BaVxigauek,128479,131680,port city of baltiersk in the oblast
6BaVxigauek,131680,134640,represents russia's only warm water
6BaVxigauek,134640,137440,baltic port that doesn't freeze over in
6BaVxigauek,137440,141040,winter kaliningrad also offers russia a
6BaVxigauek,141040,143680,base from which to station and launch
6BaVxigauek,143680,146000,weapons directly into the heart of
6BaVxigauek,146000,147440,western europe
6BaVxigauek,147440,150080,and russia has allegedly deployed
6BaVxigauek,150080,152640,nuclear weapons on the territory
6BaVxigauek,152640,155200,obviously for anything to move between
6BaVxigauek,155200,158000,kaliningrad and the rest of russia by
6BaVxigauek,158000,160720,road or rail it must travel through
6BaVxigauek,160720,163280,another sovereign state usually
6BaVxigauek,163280,166720,lithuania and on saturday lithuania's
6BaVxigauek,166720,170400,state rail operator ltg announced that
6BaVxigauek,170400,172879,it would enforce a ban on transit of
6BaVxigauek,172879,176640,goods subject to eu sanctions moving
6BaVxigauek,176640,179440,from mainland russia through lithuania
6BaVxigauek,179440,182000,to kaliningrad it's worth noting that
6BaVxigauek,182000,184480,this wasn't an entirely unilateral
6BaVxigauek,184480,187280,decision lithuania are actually just
6BaVxigauek,187280,189760,applying eu sanctions from march
6BaVxigauek,189760,192480,kaliningrad has always been a bit of a
6BaVxigauek,192480,194800,gray zone because you don't actually
6BaVxigauek,194800,197599,need a visa to travel from russia to
6BaVxigauek,197599,200319,kaliningrad through lithuania if you're
6BaVxigauek,200319,202239,travelling by rail but after
6BaVxigauek,202239,204239,consultation with the commission
6BaVxigauek,204239,207040,lithuania apparently decided to impose
6BaVxigauek,207040,209519,the eu sanctions on the area almost
6BaVxigauek,209519,212239,immediately kaliningrad's governor anton
6BaVxigauek,212239,214799,alekanov announced that he considered
6BaVxigauek,214799,218319,the move to be a most serious violation
6BaVxigauek,218319,221280,of the right to free transit in and out
6BaVxigauek,221280,224239,of kaliningrad according to ali khanov
6BaVxigauek,224239,227040,sanctions would affect about 50 percent
6BaVxigauek,227040,229599,of kaliningrad's imports to replace the
6BaVxigauek,229599,232239,shortfall alekhanov said that goods
6BaVxigauek,232239,235040,would be moved by cargo ferries and that
6BaVxigauek,235040,237280,russia was seeking to ramp up ferry
6BaVxigauek,237280,239519,frequency throughout the rest of the
6BaVxigauek,239519,242319,year the kremlin's reaction was even
6BaVxigauek,242319,244959,more furious the kremlin spokesperson
6BaVxigauek,244959,248400,dmitry peskov described the embargo as
6BaVxigauek,248400,251599,quote a violation of everything and
6BaVxigauek,251599,253519,russia's foreign ministry surmounted
6BaVxigauek,253519,257040,lithuania's charged affair in moscow to
6BaVxigauek,257040,259519,demand an immediate cancellation of the
6BaVxigauek,259519,262479,restrictions or face actions to defend
6BaVxigauek,262479,265120,russia's national interest russian state
6BaVxigauek,265120,267280,media argued that the moves were a
6BaVxigauek,267280,270720,violation of the 2002 joint statement by
6BaVxigauek,270720,273280,russia and the european union which
6BaVxigauek,273280,275600,protects passengers of people between
6BaVxigauek,275600,278479,mainland russia and kaliningrad in
6BaVxigauek,278479,281280,response the lithuanian foreign minister
6BaVxigauek,281280,283840,repeatedly stressed that lithuania is
6BaVxigauek,283840,286000,just implementing pre-agreed eu
6BaVxigauek,286000,289840,sanctions and the eu has insisted it's
6BaVxigauek,289840,293280,consistent with the 2002 joint statement
6BaVxigauek,293280,295600,because the sanctions only affect
6BaVxigauek,295600,298560,specific goods not passenger travel
6BaVxigauek,298560,301280,somewhat unsurprisingly this hasn't cut
6BaVxigauek,301280,304000,the mustard in russia on tuesday russian
6BaVxigauek,304000,305840,state media called for a military
6BaVxigauek,305840,308320,response and the kremlin announced it
6BaVxigauek,308320,310639,was preparing at quote retaliatory
6BaVxigauek,310639,313759,measures now at time of writing we don't
6BaVxigauek,313759,315759,know what these retaliatory measures
6BaVxigauek,315759,317039,will include
6BaVxigauek,317039,318960,they're unlikely to include direct
6BaVxigauek,318960,321919,military action as we see it russia is
6BaVxigauek,321919,324720,more likely to first resort to so-called
6BaVxigauek,324720,327440,hybrid warfare techniques like cyber
6BaVxigauek,327440,330560,attacks or political interference before
6BaVxigauek,330560,332639,actually putting troops on the ground
6BaVxigauek,332639,335039,it's also worth noting that russia has
6BaVxigauek,335039,337440,made similar threats in the past which
6BaVxigauek,337440,340160,haven't amounted to much peskov said
6BaVxigauek,340160,342720,that russia would have to rebalance the
6BaVxigauek,342720,345600,situation if sweden and finland were to
6BaVxigauek,345600,348160,join nato and russia's foreign ministry
6BaVxigauek,348160,351360,spokeswoman maria zakharova warned of
6BaVxigauek,351360,353440,quote military and political
6BaVxigauek,353440,356479,consequences regarding nordic accession
6BaVxigauek,356479,358880,as you've probably noticed these threats
6BaVxigauek,358880,361120,haven't come too much norway and sweden
6BaVxigauek,361120,363440,are well on their way to nato accession
6BaVxigauek,363440,366319,and say for a few flybys russia hasn't
6BaVxigauek,366319,368639,done much to stop it if russia does
6BaVxigauek,368639,370720,decide to take military action however
6BaVxigauek,370720,372720,it'll probably involve occupying the
6BaVxigauek,372720,375919,suwolki gap a 104 kilometer long strip
6BaVxigauek,375919,378400,of land along the lithuanian poland
6BaVxigauek,378400,380160,border that connects russia's
6BaVxigauek,380160,383280,kaliningrad oblast with belarus as we
6BaVxigauek,383280,385360,detailed in this video this would put
6BaVxigauek,385360,388080,nato in a difficult spot not least
6BaVxigauek,388080,389840,because it would isolate the baltic
6BaVxigauek,389840,392319,states but also because russia would
6BaVxigauek,392319,394639,deny it's a full-on invasion on the
6BaVxigauek,394639,396400,grounds they're only occupying the
6BaVxigauek,396400,398880,border not actually advancing into a
6BaVxigauek,398880,401680,nato state so far there have been sort
6BaVxigauek,401680,404000,of two reactions to this story
6BaVxigauek,404000,406319,more hawkish observers have pointed out
6BaVxigauek,406319,408319,that russia made similar threats against
6BaVxigauek,408319,411039,sweden and norway which ultimately came
6BaVxigauek,411039,413440,to nothing and that russia clearly
6BaVxigauek,413440,415759,doesn't have the capacity to fight a war
6BaVxigauek,415759,418160,against nato given that it's currently
6BaVxigauek,418160,420479,struggling in ukraine so we don't need
6BaVxigauek,420479,422479,to worry about upsetting the kremlin
6BaVxigauek,422479,425120,more dovish commentators have instead
6BaVxigauek,425120,427120,argued that this is a needless
6BaVxigauek,427120,429680,escalation that brings us one step
6BaVxigauek,429680,432240,closer to world war three while it's
6BaVxigauek,432240,435199,true that lithuania is just applying eu
6BaVxigauek,435199,437599,sanctions it's not as if the expansion
6BaVxigauek,437599,440160,of sanctions to include kaliningrad is
6BaVxigauek,440160,442160,going to have much material impact on
6BaVxigauek,442160,444560,russia's war effort and it's clear that
6BaVxigauek,444560,446960,the kremlin considers this a threat to
6BaVxigauek,446960,450240,the territorial integrity of kaliningrad
6BaVxigauek,450240,452639,if they're not addressed the escalating
6BaVxigauek,452639,455280,tensions around killing grad could
6BaVxigauek,455280,458639,actually spiral into a wider nato-russia
6BaVxigauek,458639,461599,war with potentially catastrophic
6BaVxigauek,461599,464960,consequences so which side are you on
6BaVxigauek,464960,466800,should the west treat these threats as
6BaVxigauek,466800,469599,blunders and continue applying maximum
6BaVxigauek,469599,472479,pressure on moscow or is this a bit too
6BaVxigauek,472479,474000,close for comfort
