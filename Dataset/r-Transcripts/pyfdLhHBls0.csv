pyfdLhHBls0,320,5520,and lets the rest of the team just pile  on in you can see that except was  already setting up for an a-draft they
pyfdLhHBls0,5520,11280,were looking to collapse on halls  now it's going to be this big rotation  everybody coming from tree but there's a
pyfdLhHBls0,11280,17600,lot of players waiting there at the tree  staircase and that's yay with the first  blood but because we have so many  numbers from exit we have a lot of
pyfdLhHBls0,17600,22960,trades but yay that's a hatching already  out of bullets of the headhunter out  with the classic stun and second slides
pyfdLhHBls0,22960,29439,in for the kill on a two versus two  still a neon versus neon second and cryo  the duo of this team to try to clutch it
pyfdLhHBls0,29439,36559,now for exit at the generator cryo  answers back headhunter himself as on a  two versus one crashes then gets stopped
pyfdLhHBls0,36559,42960,away and we are starting off this  matchup with both of these chambers
pyfdLhHBls0,42960,49840,and they've chosen it they're going to  start pinching towards b cryo starts off  with victor they found my trap you know  although we've broken the trademark on
pyfdLhHBls0,49840,55520,the other end of the map but aaron goes  for that flank with second players and  they're just closing in on the arcade
pyfdLhHBls0,55520,60960,it's not working out even the hero rifle  cannot even get one  for yay at this point and there's only
pyfdLhHBls0,60960,66000,one more one more to go try to slow down  the fast lane and also the high gear of
pyfdLhHBls0,66000,71360,the neon into the b side but you  currently see from this mini map  everybody from optics setting up for the
pyfdLhHBls0,71360,77600,pulse plan  but somehow bcj still gets first blood  into this round  now that spike's planet he's still
pyfdLhHBls0,77600,82960,looking for some action he gets it up  towards evan as they're closing in on  tomorrow he's gonna have to anchor it in
pyfdLhHBls0,82960,88799,it's a four versus two in favor of the  defenders but it's still going to be  some trey is going back and forth can ya
pyfdLhHBls0,88799,93920,get the clutch cannot and second saw me  for exit they have been dominating in
pyfdLhHBls0,93920,99600,terms of  that signing  we'll talk about that in a bit this is  an eco round for often optical we can
pyfdLhHBls0,99600,105280,talk about it now because it's already a  four versus one it starts with the  overdrive
pyfdLhHBls0,105360,110640,second answer your call and b first he  goes down though it's optics ready to
pyfdLhHBls0,110640,116960,absorb now right they're like okay wait  a minute except has been pushing us  let's play off that condition like that
pyfdLhHBls0,116960,123119,we'll figure out how to take him out  broken could actually support cryo with  the slower but no he's gambling
pyfdLhHBls0,123119,129039,great opportunity right now for optic to  get in and that's two ultimates to move  into the site and cryo immediately gets
pyfdLhHBls0,129039,135040,taken down because he was nullified by  the null command  marv still has ultimate they have a big
pyfdLhHBls0,135040,141040,post plan here  only one's in sight  the extremities could easily be found  here but optic does have some pretty
pyfdLhHBls0,141040,148239,good positioning on the on the entry  rolling thunder though  answered back orbital strike on the
pyfdLhHBls0,148239,154640,attack allowing everybody to move in and  also dropping aaron and fns runs in to  drop second again talking about that
pyfdLhHBls0,154640,160239,timing and the pulse plant looks perfect  for offering a pulse plant towards the  halls we're just tucked in here for the
pyfdLhHBls0,160239,166720,optic crossfire on the a site high lows  left and right and finally aaron is  closing in he will not see the third
pyfdLhHBls0,166720,172400,player and almost gets that shot but  it's crashes inside that side lands  another one this second it looked good
pyfdLhHBls0,172400,178239,the attacker sign then after they ping  out that it's okay cryo playing with the  operator gravity or on b they still
pyfdLhHBls0,178239,183599,wanted to challenge and fight it  although a shock an op shot is missed  it's still going to be a battle towards
pyfdLhHBls0,183599,188720,a-holes between these two players who's  winning it so far it's going to be even  but
pyfdLhHBls0,188720,194080,exit has given up the drop now we've  moved in aaron's trying to hold sand  another trade off as we have a three
pyfdLhHBls0,194080,200879,versus three we have a koal from crashes  though who pushes towards the spawn and  gets the hedge on to cryo yay continuing
pyfdLhHBls0,200879,207200,with the jiggle peeks against death  rashi so it's gonna be not bad to have  yay sit up here to help help there is
pyfdLhHBls0,207200,213440,that slide coming in from second a pinch  very soon from the back end and that's  aaron with a kill from a frenzy and  another one that's another frenzy but
pyfdLhHBls0,213440,219440,it's an underhand throw from crashes to  be able to stay alive for a bit until  he's greeted by def on the other end so
pyfdLhHBls0,219440,224959,pinch after pinch x head opens at the b  site put it to three versus three we  don't want to let it we want to give the
pyfdLhHBls0,224959,230720,space for optic we're already going with  the flash and a simultaneous triple kill  for everybody from optics usually their
pyfdLhHBls0,230720,236799,contact a lot now it's going to be util  looks like they will take b van silly  what a stun oh my god barb is just
pyfdLhHBls0,236799,241920,running and dancing through the walls  here just so you can stay alive but yeah  everything gets broken up right after
pyfdLhHBls0,241920,248560,fastlane coming out though and that's  actually not spotted but then after that  kryol's looking behind his side just all  the false that was picked up and yay
pyfdLhHBls0,248560,254000,pull up the superstar play  not gonna happen look at the amount of  stuns that are coming out second goal
pyfdLhHBls0,254000,260239,for the spray with the bulldog and goes  for the neon dip on to victor yay though  again we talked about it still defaults
pyfdLhHBls0,260239,266880,towards a main now he's getting stunned  force the tp away but this is still a  time killer to allow optic to rotate
pyfdLhHBls0,266880,272800,back from defender spawn now we have fns  to group up with them the flash comes  out they're trying to re-fight towards
pyfdLhHBls0,272800,278479,this side but aaron gets the head shot  onto yay and now that operator the  biggest gun that they had falls down at
pyfdLhHBls0,278479,285680,least they still have the vandal that  they picked up on the other end and  that's marv that gets the kill back to  two versus two somehow then to a 1v1
pyfdLhHBls0,285680,292160,death the igl stopped by marv  minute ticks by without too much action  and then everything explodes that's
pyfdLhHBls0,292160,299040,exactly it but they also have the  orbital strike and i thought it was  going to be mark trying to run away and  play at least a denial with the orbital
pyfdLhHBls0,299040,305600,strike but second goes to work with two  headshots right there and finally their  rounds have turned back in favor of exit
pyfdLhHBls0,305600,312000,at default stim pack on the ground just  to see if could run away there you go it  works out oh just for a bit until he
pyfdLhHBls0,312000,318479,gets that kill onto fns again they have  lower weaponry for the defender half  with the defender side rather and
pyfdLhHBls0,318479,324800,crashes and marv  trying to clutch it marvis committed  rashes as well closing it now in front
pyfdLhHBls0,324800,332240,of generator the elbow peeks out a  little bit  head shot from crashes now they're going  to try to help hunt down cryo on the top
pyfdLhHBls0,332240,338720,tt available the swing out with the head  shot trying to go for the defuse can't  get it at halfway and this now should be
pyfdLhHBls0,338720,344000,the round coming in here for exit  because you cannot win this a little bit
pyfdLhHBls0,344000,349600,of delay  that actually gets heard we're going to  fight inside that  we actually see the gun and it's going
pyfdLhHBls0,349600,354960,to be victor with the wall bank coming  in from the b site victor lines up with  the second one aaron falls the fight
pyfdLhHBls0,354960,361520,towards heaven and everything is getting  held by the crashes and victor combo  leaving one more inside sight it's only
pyfdLhHBls0,361520,367360,one second that was able to actually not  make it inside i wonder if second still  goes way ahead of the storm fault line
pyfdLhHBls0,367360,373039,comes through that was from deep balls  can second make the play alone nope not  when you're jumping like that epis hears
pyfdLhHBls0,373039,378479,it through both of the fast lanes and  marv gets the wall banging the  two-player stack somehow it's a two
pyfdLhHBls0,378479,384560,versus one the spike is down thankfully  a wall is up  now def is just a wall giving a lot of
pyfdLhHBls0,384560,392000,opportunities yeah  now with the fragment we're trying to  break at least one section of that wall
pyfdLhHBls0,392000,397680,we don't still have another flash of the  goal for crashes after and a full kit  for victor this is going to be very hard
pyfdLhHBls0,397680,404400,for depth to try to hold it into sight  but now that it's planning for a main  they might think that it's there to  slide to come in depth with the headshot
pyfdLhHBls0,404400,409919,definitely give back  shot out to crashes and that is gonna be  the red bull clutch on that two versus
pyfdLhHBls0,409919,415360,one spike's now planet everybody pinned  inside  the a site for exit so there's around
pyfdLhHBls0,415360,422000,here for optic to close in but pay  attention there's gonna be alert  happening very soon oh my god an  overdrive kill that's victor moving in
pyfdLhHBls0,422000,427280,fast lane's coming up and actually  crashes here's and knows to rotate now  we have a three minute but we're
pyfdLhHBls0,427280,432319,fighting back at a high level the wall  banks coming in and two players a little  one on each side and we still have
pyfdLhHBls0,432319,438160,utility though from crashes  coming out with the head hunter here and  crashes gets the hedgehog to aaron we're
pyfdLhHBls0,438160,443360,trying to close in for the slam the  aftershock on the top the relay bolt on  the staircase but yay he's not affected
pyfdLhHBls0,443360,448960,by anything else the wall coming up  we're in front of it fns gets together  and now it's a three versus three we've
pyfdLhHBls0,448960,454720,answered that for exit we have 26  seconds left on the clock but the spike  is down but we are such in a long rotate
pyfdLhHBls0,454720,460400,now for optic we have a molly in the  front a plot now for exit
pyfdLhHBls0,460400,467440,and that calls out also  now molly coming in just trying to pluck  some players out doesn't work out
pyfdLhHBls0,467440,472479,and now you're playing a full spot with  two offs potentially but second pulls  back out with the vandal but it's traded
pyfdLhHBls0,472479,477599,out it's a one versus one now crash he  still has one more flash the molly's on  the ground we have to push forward for
pyfdLhHBls0,477599,483520,the flash he gets the kill but as that  clock is ticking now he's going all  around lots of storylines there are lots
pyfdLhHBls0,483520,488879,of things and components to look out for  between exit and optic today it's not  only about the duelist but we'll talk
pyfdLhHBls0,488879,493919,about that a little bit later because we  are not stopping for optic that's going  to be victor with two opening kills
pyfdLhHBls0,493919,500000,really quick towards the dish but  aaron's still alive he could still hold  this corner marv is watching that flank  and things are looking really good here
pyfdLhHBls0,500000,505199,for optic to close this out but after  the reef was killed that's what i'm  saying they're just holding their ground
pyfdLhHBls0,505199,511680,up this victor playing behind the boxes  waiting for contact from crash keys he's  going to go for the underhand throws
pyfdLhHBls0,511680,517919,spots contact not even needed these guys  are actually just going to hold it and  start pushing before exit
pyfdLhHBls0,517919,524480,and finally the flash comes out but it's  still going to be a player advantage for  optic try on the other end though
pyfdLhHBls0,524480,530320,he was up to tally on a 3-3 fault line  then coming out that's coming in from  the rotation to allow optic to come out
pyfdLhHBls0,530320,537120,inside the b site and marv is already in  and somehow it is going to be exit  that's actually pinned for a hit into
pyfdLhHBls0,537120,542160,heavens  marvin is pushing up first headshot down  spike is down gateway
pyfdLhHBls0,542160,548800,easy shot one more to go aaron you've  punched it once before  but it's not gonna happen this time yay
pyfdLhHBls0,548800,554000,gets the kill they make the comeback saw  that second half  again we'll keep track of the pistol
pyfdLhHBls0,554000,559440,rounds either team has been able to win  both in all of their head-to-heads kryol  starts off with a huge head-hunter and
pyfdLhHBls0,559440,565760,they are in c  dash is already in victor is down  towards that left side of long c
pyfdLhHBls0,565760,571680,and that is going to be just  unanswered rounds unanswered rounds and  finally vic or marv sorry he's trying to
pyfdLhHBls0,571680,577200,do as much as he can  unfortunately not good enough only one  to fall
pyfdLhHBls0,577200,582880,spike now planning for v1 first headshot  looking towards that left where death is
pyfdLhHBls0,582880,589519,lands that one but already right click  classic is good enough for now we've  affirmed the plan towards b for x at two
pyfdLhHBls0,589519,595600,players on the a-link  flash from fns a push coming out but  it's still trying with the two kills
pyfdLhHBls0,595600,601519,mopping everything up victor meanwhile  does get a little bit of damage but  still wins that fight versus aaron as
pyfdLhHBls0,601519,606959,they're trying to retake towards the  front b nice job by flashing he's  holding up the b-side on his own on a
pyfdLhHBls0,606959,613440,retake leaving now second and bcj under  two versus two a smoke actually splits  them out but it's still second that wins
pyfdLhHBls0,613440,619839,that duel  marv trying to clutch a dash pushes him  away and now he goes they know that at
pyfdLhHBls0,619839,625440,least he went for the fake plant trying  to go for another one here  trying to play the anti-flash but it's
pyfdLhHBls0,625440,630640,still going to be second creeping out  with a kill on the specter and that  that's him inside b and they're looking
pyfdLhHBls0,630640,637839,for oh  now that we go for a c-slide split for
pyfdLhHBls0,637839,644320,exit nice gravity well at least from  marv just to slow down the pace a bit  allowing it to move out but it gets  immediately traded out
pyfdLhHBls0,644320,650800,guided light towards the garage blinds  one but little did they know here for  optic that there's three players from  exit here and now we cancel out the
pyfdLhHBls0,650800,655839,plans and maybe rotate back towards a if  we want to where yay still posted up at
pyfdLhHBls0,655839,661839,least on the a link  oh my god crashes is pushing forward
pyfdLhHBls0,661839,667200,he's going to catch a perfect timing  here  back towards c  but unfortunately there's still a trap
pyfdLhHBls0,667200,673440,available  for the attacker  oh he gets the hedge on the lease onto
pyfdLhHBls0,673440,680320,aaron so there's no smoke inside c  marv gets head shot in by second as  second gets another opener inside of
pyfdLhHBls0,680320,686480,sight  so at three versus two they know that  crashes  land the shotgun
pyfdLhHBls0,686480,692320,now the spike has been planted and nice  it closes everything off they create the  angles they want instantly but they're
pyfdLhHBls0,692320,703040,not checking the back this time yes  second head the flank they creep in to  get b once again from optic spike victor
pyfdLhHBls0,703040,709120,surprise attack on the first two  and the third one unfortunately he went  towards the back of gong the tap coming
pyfdLhHBls0,709120,715120,out from victor still trying to find  aaron  and aaron gets that frag  he's on his own but he know where
pyfdLhHBls0,715120,722560,aaron's at they need this clutch a fake  tp  head hunter is out
pyfdLhHBls0,722560,729360,aaron playing on the top of the ledge  straight across their place but goes  behind the spoken picks it up with the  phantom kill and yay goes from the
pyfdLhHBls0,729360,736480,clutch from b to c back into garage  where he started and again and they're  going to try to get for the peak here
pyfdLhHBls0,736480,743120,yeah i mean x at this time is like okay  you could be anywhere so we're just  gonna hold our ground default fracture  style as we did before
pyfdLhHBls0,743120,749040,and uh  optic gets a piece of their own medicine  a repeat coming out and then crashes is
pyfdLhHBls0,749040,754880,trying to hold towards garage elise  silver lining his fns  unfortunate there he played the
pyfdLhHBls0,754880,761279,anti-flash thought the fleck was for the  flanks or it was garage to the right  side of the site
pyfdLhHBls0,761680,767760,oh big fragment huge  marvin's gonna get the easy kill now on  to second at fourteen eighteen
pyfdLhHBls0,767760,774000,beautiful relay from victor who gets the  hedge on to pcj barf not pushing down  because they know that he's there so at
pyfdLhHBls0,774000,779279,least he's gonna get the information  with 24 seconds left on the clock spike  is now down turret's still up though the
pyfdLhHBls0,779279,785200,trademark watching the flank so they  have to try to get the kill here there  is one fns does connect onto cryo and
pyfdLhHBls0,785200,791200,he's not even need it for the flank  that's fns for the third kick marv is  now moving back towards garage and he's
pyfdLhHBls0,791200,796880,playing the angle from under window  30 seconds left pivotal position right  now
pyfdLhHBls0,796880,802399,big kill from marv but it gets  immediately traded out by zekken that  now allows the plant but it's a three on
pyfdLhHBls0,802399,807760,three  three on three no smoke's hair or there  so you're gonna get zucchin down long to
pyfdLhHBls0,807760,814320,be able to get the flame they'll let the  team know they can focus sight but this  is gonna be tough to dash in
pyfdLhHBls0,818160,823839,and it's the gap in the smoke to allow  cryo to get the quad kill into the round  optic here to start that's absolutely
pyfdLhHBls0,823839,829040,huge but they have already taken b  and a slide coming
pyfdLhHBls0,829040,835279,and a little bit too late for the rest  of except to move back up to trade the  kill on to death  so smokes are down but at least they get
pyfdLhHBls0,835279,841360,a plant now on to b  trail blazer is going to spot victor who  does have support from me as well two
pyfdLhHBls0,841360,848959,players are low they're inside garage  cry though opening up towards the a-link  practice has to come up huge towards
pyfdLhHBls0,848959,854639,that gong nice little alert kill so you  can get that frag on to cryo second  through the smoke and we get to pull the
pyfdLhHBls0,854639,860959,fuse in that's exit with pistol a match  in the next of this series and
pyfdLhHBls0,860959,867760,off this timeout it's very quick from  both ends just to try to deny control of  garage and that's victor sliding in a
pyfdLhHBls0,867760,872480,nice flash to allow him to get a kill  onto bcj
pyfdLhHBls0,873120,881040,but victor is still on hp and seconds  back there it's two players in the back  with death  easy kills with the spectre too focused
pyfdLhHBls0,881040,887040,on zekkin not clearing logs and now  seconds at seven hp  we're deaf
pyfdLhHBls0,887040,892560,he's just looking to play the trade  because he has no utility left to  support his teammate crashes and yay on
pyfdLhHBls0,892560,898160,their own  coming out  and the lineup works out for both optic
pyfdLhHBls0,898160,903279,players  on his lonesome it's now a one versus  one as the spike is down towards the sea
pyfdLhHBls0,903279,909120,site and it's now going to be the  chamber on chamber  yeah
pyfdLhHBls0,909120,913839,we saw bulldogs in the hands of some of  the members of optics
pyfdLhHBls0,915040,921839,so now corral is the one pushing forward  gets that first kill onto yay full-time  situation nice done but vickers still
pyfdLhHBls0,921839,928320,gets the frag beautiful flash once again  it's a three versus three fragment
pyfdLhHBls0,928320,933600,available for fns just to run that clock  down  flash will not gonna do anything here
pyfdLhHBls0,933600,940079,for exit as now we finally tap the spike  we've got spokes after smoke's second on  the top crash he's trying to get the
pyfdLhHBls0,940079,945440,spray and it's not gonna work out  another stick the fuse coming into the  second half for example focusing for
pyfdLhHBls0,945440,951680,optic to split inside a site trailblazer  to come out beautiful faultline coming  out as well and that's two players
pyfdLhHBls0,951680,956720,falling down now for team except  on the defense and yay also falling down
pyfdLhHBls0,956720,963040,but zekken is also holding towards that  back of the site  i mean the ones with the more frenzies i
pyfdLhHBls0,963040,970160,think  mentioned that earlier on today on the  eu broadcast if you have more frenzies  take lee you should win so now exits on
pyfdLhHBls0,970160,975600,a two versus one with marv looking to  clutch it  remaining also if you think about the
pyfdLhHBls0,975600,981759,situation frank nice push out and he'll  smoke hookah dislike whatever's coming  in but he does not know long has been
pyfdLhHBls0,981759,986800,pushed obscuring fishes  now optic have made it inside b side
pyfdLhHBls0,986800,992560,jiggle peaks coming out from crashy so  he's going to spot two players now  crossing in from market into sands don't
pyfdLhHBls0,992560,999199,know that a third has crossed which is  why you still see marth looking towards  spawn  on the outside of b
pyfdLhHBls0,999199,1006240,lots of players playing out here towards  the long beam aaron dropping in fns gets  that head shot from the frenzy
pyfdLhHBls0,1006240,1012560,and now bcg spotted inside hookah they  spotted all three and bcj  and zekky will just have to try to fight
pyfdLhHBls0,1012560,1018480,it  yeah got it light regrowth and that was  a mis-timing miscommunication bc jason
pyfdLhHBls0,1018480,1024240,was trying to heal up second so they  could jump out together better for them  to spray through from trophy room so
pyfdLhHBls0,1024240,1030240,that we could actually stay anchored  inside the site for optic nice shot here  from fryo as we're going in for a wall
pyfdLhHBls0,1030240,1036240,bang on to marvin the numbers are coming  down to the pulse plant the flash was a  good attempt now crotch is on his own
pyfdLhHBls0,1036240,1042480,and that becomes a flawless retake from  getting owned on a pulse plan and it  again looking to be something quick
pyfdLhHBls0,1042480,1048000,already won inside the site orbital  start to come out on the defense  but it's still all four versus four
pyfdLhHBls0,1048000,1053280,after all that commotion inside b a plan  about to  come down if they can clear a bit of
pyfdLhHBls0,1053280,1060000,space she'll start coming out oh spawn  in that second with a tag on to crashes  and aaron picks up the up
pyfdLhHBls0,1060000,1065200,so the boombot allows him to get the  space but yay's waiting there  aaron
pyfdLhHBls0,1065200,1072000,makes it a four versus four  now for the rest well it's 30 seconds  left let's try to hit towards this  b-side because it's still an opera on a
pyfdLhHBls0,1072000,1077600,seekers are coming out for information  too so this will allow a fast road sweep  from exit from a to b and bcj still
pyfdLhHBls0,1077600,1083600,holds it towards the elbow of b site and  these fraggers are continuing to frag  bcj with three
pyfdLhHBls0,1083600,1089360,acts that have a chance to breathe  and set up otherwise you're right like  we've seen rushes here we are seekers go
pyfdLhHBls0,1089360,1094480,off fans  oh unfortunately though it's a double  stack and at least marvin is there to
pyfdLhHBls0,1094480,1100640,trade it out makes it a two versus two  with heroic plays astral divide right on  the outside of the side allowing him to
pyfdLhHBls0,1100640,1107039,plant safely  as he hears the jumps from death across  the wall  def rotating back over to triple where
pyfdLhHBls0,1107039,1112240,yay's holding with the off and now it's  all up to cryo  operator in hand
pyfdLhHBls0,1112240,1118480,spike at the apc and two players playing  the pulse plant  no stars available here from mars so he
pyfdLhHBls0,1118480,1124320,rotates all the way across to showers  and this is going to make it difficult  now window of opportunity for cryo
pyfdLhHBls0,1124320,1130080,thankfully it's back open  as he ain't misses the op shot
pyfdLhHBls0,1131840,1138880,trying to get the tp's phantom picked up  going for the piece here from death  two players playing inside u-haul for
pyfdLhHBls0,1138880,1145280,optic one playing the anti-flash crashes  on contact  no flash coming in but the dual
pyfdLhHBls0,1145280,1151120,combination oh the option of crawl then  on to the vandal what is going away no
pyfdLhHBls0,1151120,1156640,it's a three versus two yank trying to  see the round misses the shot and force  the tp away and we are closing the gap
pyfdLhHBls0,1156640,1162720,now for exit for the retake jump spot  spotting mark here on to short a the  wall coming up yaylen in the shot clock
pyfdLhHBls0,1162720,1168799,is ticking down so def has to start  sticking at least a half way aaron needs  to put this wall down so he can try to  get a kill puts the wall down for the
pyfdLhHBls0,1168799,1174640,first kill and the second one up to marv  and the defuse is gonna come in for  death throwing the whole kitchen sink at
pyfdLhHBls0,1174640,1180960,him  they're still gonna try for it though  their goal your star is actually a  recall one comes in so they do have two  to black box
pyfdLhHBls0,1180960,1187039,block the back of the site secrets right  away to  bcj as it gets stunned it's still one
pyfdLhHBls0,1187039,1192960,for one across the board  nice job so far from both ends but we  still have a second alive and the smoke
pyfdLhHBls0,1192960,1200000,who runs out on the timing lines up to  the trip kill into the round leaving now  crashes on his own 19 hp the one that
pyfdLhHBls0,1200000,1207600,started the seekers to get information  and now he's gonna have to be the one  that's gonna try to clutch it and as he  looks out the second gets a 4k but this
pyfdLhHBls0,1207600,1214559,is a team that heads down they flow and  they flow hard it's going to be a quick  push by victor here as i just get a
pyfdLhHBls0,1214559,1219679,quick crow foot in the mouth  as a push from optic comes in but it has
pyfdLhHBls0,1219679,1225360,been noticed from except they always  place high they're always in these  positions in this time they're making it
pyfdLhHBls0,1225360,1231200,count and they grab another pistol of  this series yay is getting a second kill  or should i say a first kill second
pyfdLhHBls0,1231200,1236640,combined for update because we talked  about the flow for exit it's been an  overflow of optic on loan b to start
pyfdLhHBls0,1236640,1242240,things off aaron trying to answer back  as he pushes force pipes with this  frenzy but there's still too many
pyfdLhHBls0,1242240,1248720,players over floor windows trellis or  there you go finally spots for a bit we  talked about the initiator utility he's
pyfdLhHBls0,1248720,1255440,actually playing on his own because the  rest of them are just moving out with  the specters for the traits so now it  opens up here for exit to get into b
pyfdLhHBls0,1255440,1261840,site for a plant crash is getting tanked  a little bit due to smoke so we identify  one player on defense trying to pull
pyfdLhHBls0,1261840,1268000,back and run that clock down  or at least try to hold it so the rest  can rotate over from the spawn and
pyfdLhHBls0,1268000,1273840,unfortunately it doesn't work out from  the spawn and  oh they hear noise though and they
pyfdLhHBls0,1273840,1280480,instantly back off to reset vancilly x  that's just not still holding gravity  well  that allows marv to get a kill here with
pyfdLhHBls0,1280480,1285600,the spectre and yay's flashed out  towards showers does have to do the  false orbitals right to come out forcing
pyfdLhHBls0,1285600,1292240,him out of position too that's an easy  kill for death  and now advantage for optic
pyfdLhHBls0,1292240,1298480,another force by coming in for the  defender side  this is the story of optic being played
pyfdLhHBls0,1298480,1305280,by these forces how to retaliate but  it's just  gonna be one to stay calm and it's going  to be a smoke up instead
pyfdLhHBls0,1305280,1312480,we take the advantage to allow the  attackers to flash and come through but  that's two players that meets him just  at the octagon second flash gets shot
pyfdLhHBls0,1312480,1320320,inside the smoke but bcj still gets the  headshot off the victor seekers are now  coming out the three versus three
pyfdLhHBls0,1320320,1325600,as that gives info on the players moving  in towards spawn and that last seeker  being killed well okay we know that the
pyfdLhHBls0,1325600,1332159,rotation's already really close for  optic  the hill comes up from bcj they could  look to reset if they want to but
pyfdLhHBls0,1332159,1338400,they're assigned to cut noise for now  here  might have time for another guiding
pyfdLhHBls0,1338400,1345600,light for the side of bcj it's going to  be late though  oh the molly the backside to clear the
pyfdLhHBls0,1345600,1352480,push they displace optic in their  defense without knowing where they are  but a huge play from yay
pyfdLhHBls0,1353760,1360080,versus one though fns outside towards  hookah he makes the 180 and the headshot  for the red bull club now a change of
pyfdLhHBls0,1360080,1366480,pace from optic  facts against the wall and potentially  their best map in  valence mentioned it before they're
pyfdLhHBls0,1366480,1371600,potentially the best team in the world  right now on bind and they're getting  thrashed by exit now
pyfdLhHBls0,1371600,1377280,and we're talking about the change of  pace it's a flank coming in from victor  only with pistols  because he had the overdrive at the
pyfdLhHBls0,1377280,1384080,beginning of the round but the tp's come  out as marv  gets caught by bcg after he was able to  get to
pyfdLhHBls0,1384640,1390720,[Music]  there's just too many people who are  overextending our stay
pyfdLhHBls0,1390720,1395919,and  door has been shut  marved on his own forced back inside
pyfdLhHBls0,1395919,1401200,window and the tv comes out for a pinch  from victor and that's not good enough
pyfdLhHBls0,1401200,1406480,five versus two  as now we have one more pushing forward
pyfdLhHBls0,1406480,1412000,it's gonna be aaron inside you  fns in the back of the apc trying to  catch his timing across and it doesn't
pyfdLhHBls0,1412000,1417679,work out that's from a beautiful molly  from death  that kept fns preventing him from
pyfdLhHBls0,1417679,1422960,getting inside the smoke and marv is now  going to have to go for  an ace
pyfdLhHBls0,1422960,1429200,for the red little clutch and the last  seeker on top of the trademark why not  bcg like i said has been feeling at this
pyfdLhHBls0,1429200,1434799,map and after the swings the prime  giving flawless as exit put 13 and seven
pyfdLhHBls0,1434799,1442240,on optics best map so they know that mid  is going to be the hover this flash  through it's going to be a little bit of  a pop flash and only choose not too
pyfdLhHBls0,1442240,1448480,oh  i was gonna say that's so close for the  right click sometimes too or maybe a
pyfdLhHBls0,1448480,1454080,little bit too far than a spread who  would have made a miss for a bit but he  recomposes with the left clicks for the
pyfdLhHBls0,1454080,1460159,kill meanwhile though another has fallen  and aaron has snuck through at least  through a main
pyfdLhHBls0,1460159,1466559,and that's a flash for not a swing so  this is an opportunity here just on the  other edge fns around the corner with
pyfdLhHBls0,1466559,1472640,his own enemy remaining easy to kill so  good he's on cat has now rotated off
pyfdLhHBls0,1472640,1478559,so they're thinking it this reset is b  they're right on one crashing is going  to be there but this now could throw him
pyfdLhHBls0,1478559,1485279,for a loop again a round where x-set  hits both sides just about at the same  time this time
pyfdLhHBls0,1485279,1490480,they get the advantage on a that was  just the perfect lurk there from here to  get that kill yeah that forced a jump up
pyfdLhHBls0,1490480,1495760,oh crap it's going towards the a side he  jumps out and he open gets picked off  but here comes another flank so we have
pyfdLhHBls0,1495760,1501760,two simultaneous battles here on both  ends and great job continue to just have  yay be in mid at this point so he's
pyfdLhHBls0,1501760,1509200,gonna be first contact  oh my god now he has the upper hand
pyfdLhHBls0,1509200,1515120,he has the upper hand for two kills  unfortunately off that the battle  towards a main bcj still trying to keep
pyfdLhHBls0,1515120,1521840,the dream alive into this round in the  second  as it's 30 seconds left
pyfdLhHBls0,1526320,1532159,def does get the kill with the vandal  though they're traded back  but there's 18 seconds left nice flick
pyfdLhHBls0,1532159,1537440,there from crashes recon into the site  and you have to commit now for the last
pyfdLhHBls0,1537440,1542799,two players of exit or you save your  weapons it's either or and it's gonna be  the first option to try to run in for a
pyfdLhHBls0,1542799,1550159,plant  nice kill at least from oh my god  a triple kill from second leaving only
pyfdLhHBls0,1550159,1555360,fns on his own  which is why here bcj's keeping all the
pyfdLhHBls0,1555360,1560080,way back towards spawn  but yay waits for him
pyfdLhHBls0,1561679,1567360,so much length control and pressure  that's it right  once they move in now into the b site we
pyfdLhHBls0,1567360,1574320,talked about the  initiators utility yeah i saw the knife  in the back of the site that actually  pinged out second counter knife gets
pyfdLhHBls0,1574320,1580799,sprayed  luckily through a wall so that does not  disable anybody there allowing yay to  pick up four kills and crashes on the
pyfdLhHBls0,1580799,1585840,alt  so that's gonna  foil the plans of exit moving into the  site there's ten seconds left and we're
pyfdLhHBls0,1585840,1591760,just gonna play hit run that clock down  and it's not gonna work out too well fns  is still in the back of the site now
pyfdLhHBls0,1591760,1598559,there's no time we get the kill in but  somehow aaron stays alive and marv all  he has to do is to lean towards a right
pyfdLhHBls0,1598559,1603679,now it's up to crashes to hold down  on his own
pyfdLhHBls0,1605200,1610480,lauren bot pre-fired shot misses from  aaron but you saw that paranoia and
pyfdLhHBls0,1610480,1616159,shark dart onto the ground as a debuff  comes in and  now we've opened up the site for exit
pyfdLhHBls0,1616159,1621919,players yay  almost and now the zero point just came  up to  the zero points across the map so that's
pyfdLhHBls0,1621919,1627840,not gonna help now you have the lockdown  coming in on the attack but that's just  to clear out towards market and fns just
pyfdLhHBls0,1627840,1633039,picks so many players that allows two  players  to fall for exit and as the lockdown's
pyfdLhHBls0,1633039,1640159,about to come out we still have a line  of defense towards the back of the site  and that's crashed he's a high-low drop  that allows cryo to get the kill and we
pyfdLhHBls0,1640159,1646559,have a plant that's safe but there's 10  hp remaining for cryo fragmenting coming  down onto default and yay onto the
pyfdLhHBls0,1646559,1654320,sidewalk making it now a two versus one  as bcg answers back  five seconds left 32 hp finter running
pyfdLhHBls0,1654320,1661039,forward  and a drop in the victor gets the kill  one way being refreshed we're running  back towards the b site where aaron's
pyfdLhHBls0,1661039,1667360,pushing forward with the frenzy around  the corner gets instantly headshotted  now by fns as we're now going to try to
pyfdLhHBls0,1667360,1674399,just run it in towards b site seconds  rotate it across towards the stairs  haunt also to clear out logs
pyfdLhHBls0,1674399,1679679,and second what can you do  here's the footsteps the first drop  the lean towards the back the right
pyfdLhHBls0,1679679,1684720,clicks does a bit of damage  but it's still victor though that trades  off the kill and it will be a plant
pyfdLhHBls0,1684720,1691679,coming in for optic on a floor versus  two 30 seconds left overall smart play  by optic i mean think about how exxon
pyfdLhHBls0,1691679,1696880,has played their pistol rounds on  defense we'll just stop for a second as  they dive in
pyfdLhHBls0,1696880,1703840,dick is that we've made it through  guardian we're trying to break the  rotation so we're trying to get a flank  on heaven too  this should be the kill for yay and he
pyfdLhHBls0,1703840,1710480,does take the upper hand  as players are now taking control of a  site we do have bcj in hell
pyfdLhHBls0,1710480,1716640,he's a big position here but the rest of  optic are now pushing back towards the b  side but there's still players there  there's still aaron inside the site
pyfdLhHBls0,1716640,1723039,there's six seconds left on the clock  he's on the sidewalk the plant's now  coming in  he gets the kill they rot they won the
pyfdLhHBls0,1723039,1728880,round thanks to that except puts more  onto the board it's also a thing they  talked about on the desk is not giving
pyfdLhHBls0,1728880,1735279,up those frags just as much but the  positioning is getting scary oh the  double kill from aaron the lineup and
pyfdLhHBls0,1735279,1741360,you still have second in the back of the  side he gets spotted by a crawler though  crows running out  through the smoke he gets treated at
pyfdLhHBls0,1741360,1747200,least but that still means that you have  a second alive in the back of the site  one person is down and just suddenly
pyfdLhHBls0,1747200,1753039,like that all the two on a side very  passively in the back of jenny and  heaven  log down also
pyfdLhHBls0,1753039,1759279,secures the fact that the hit's gonna be  going towards a and kryl and defra  holding it in crash he's trying to get
pyfdLhHBls0,1759279,1764799,the plant down  as he does get support here what a dark  coming out putting out shot misses the
pyfdLhHBls0,1764799,1770720,wall bank come out from heaven from  second though and that second with the  right click in the end moley they are
pyfdLhHBls0,1770720,1777600,setting themselves up so well 40 seconds  again another round where it looks like  optic could be pushed down to the timer
pyfdLhHBls0,1777600,1784000,and victor comes up with a huge kill on  cryo and that's twice first crash he's  now victor going with the shoulder peak
pyfdLhHBls0,1784000,1791120,that  unfortunately trial can't react fast  enough and the ko alt allows fns to get  the the kill of death pushing on a
pyfdLhHBls0,1791120,1797279,rotate so we're going to rotate back  towards the a site but bcj the other  line of defense watching he's just so
pyfdLhHBls0,1797279,1803600,aware  he's gonna take him out  like this
pyfdLhHBls0,1803600,1810399,crow is waiting  as they thought it was an opening here  for optic to get into market the b site
pyfdLhHBls0,1810399,1816320,it's weighted  by an operator and a prime gaming  flawless you're inside mid
pyfdLhHBls0,1816320,1821679,that's a smoked oh that's a timing on  the recall that's  you could definitely see that they're
pyfdLhHBls0,1821679,1826880,starting to get flustered now for optic  this is exactly what you want to see  from except
pyfdLhHBls0,1826880,1832880,going international knowing that a team  can come back from a deficit like that
pyfdLhHBls0,1832880,1838320,to almost pull 10 straight rounds into  their favor after losing the first two  bonus on
pyfdLhHBls0,1838320,1844880,absolutely incredible and it shows how  much except have been able to grow they  persevere over that consistency of optic
pyfdLhHBls0,1844880,1850960,being able  to weather the storm oh my god  even white swing he doesn't care and he
pyfdLhHBls0,1850960,1857360,still wins those fights and now victory  though is trying to at least get  something done for optic
pyfdLhHBls0,1857360,1862799,as the spike is down towards garden he's  got 21 hp to his name here is the  updraft and crowd gets the kill just
pyfdLhHBls0,1862799,1869360,gonna go for an alt right off the rip a  counter coming back from crash oh my  gosh second second does connect on to
pyfdLhHBls0,1869360,1875279,the smoker so that's no spokes now for  optic with a broken by nothing left
pyfdLhHBls0,1875279,1880880,except the nightfall that you hope that  there's gonna be something done with  that but it goes towards the site so you  still have two players that are
pyfdLhHBls0,1880880,1887919,unaffected towards mario moore and  that's aaron yes yay and crash he's now  trying to win a two versus four
pyfdLhHBls0,1887919,1894159,will it work out smokes are being thrown  out towards the main one  comes out from the attackers two as yay
pyfdLhHBls0,1894159,1901120,falls and crashes on a four versus one  it's not gonna happen who better than  bcg to get the last two kills to put
pyfdLhHBls0,1901120,1906720,exit as the vct north america stage two  champions
pyfdLhHBls0,1906720,1912559,exit riding high  a squad that has always placed at the
pyfdLhHBls0,1912559,1916480,top of the table  fine
