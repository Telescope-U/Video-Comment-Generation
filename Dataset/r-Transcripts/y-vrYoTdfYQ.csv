y-vrYoTdfYQ,36559,38399,and he does and it's
y-vrYoTdfYQ,38399,40879,hit past hoy park so what
y-vrYoTdfYQ,40879,42480,would have been a double play had park
y-vrYoTdfYQ,42480,44399,fielded it cleanly
y-vrYoTdfYQ,44399,46640,we'll eat him up a base hit for soto and
y-vrYoTdfYQ,46640,49280,it's first and second right away here
y-vrYoTdfYQ,49280,51120,if he catches this i mean he's got the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,51120,52640,ball in his glove and soto hasn't taken
y-vrYoTdfYQ,52640,54960,a step out of the box yet
y-vrYoTdfYQ,54960,58680,big spot for josh
y-vrYoTdfYQ,60000,62239,oh van meter makes a nice play and they
y-vrYoTdfYQ,62239,64640,get a double play there you go that ball
y-vrYoTdfYQ,64640,66720,was hit hard but van meter
y-vrYoTdfYQ,66720,68479,johnny on the spot turns it into a
y-vrYoTdfYQ,68479,70479,double play josh bell
y-vrYoTdfYQ,70479,72560,lines it to van meter hernandez doubled
y-vrYoTdfYQ,72560,75040,off second one at bad for cruz against
y-vrYoTdfYQ,75040,78720,this righty it was a base on balls
y-vrYoTdfYQ,79840,82159,eyeball to left ziewinski back
y-vrYoTdfYQ,82159,83200,track
y-vrYoTdfYQ,83200,84560,wall
y-vrYoTdfYQ,84560,87360,makes the catch
y-vrYoTdfYQ,87360,89680,at the wall
y-vrYoTdfYQ,89680,93040,jack ziwinski tracked it down
y-vrYoTdfYQ,93040,94479,good to see you
y-vrYoTdfYQ,94479,96159,fun to watch
y-vrYoTdfYQ,96159,99360,and up to the plate comes jack swinsky
y-vrYoTdfYQ,99360,101759,a 15th round pick of the padres back in
y-vrYoTdfYQ,101759,104759,2016.
y-vrYoTdfYQ,105439,107439,a fly ball to right field toward the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,107439,109360,wall this is going to get down and
y-vrYoTdfYQ,109360,111280,bounce over the wall so
y-vrYoTdfYQ,111280,113119,the nationals get a break of course
y-vrYoTdfYQ,113119,115600,madrid to go back to third as sawinski
y-vrYoTdfYQ,115600,117840,doubles into the right field corner
y-vrYoTdfYQ,117840,119280,and that was another pitch it was right
y-vrYoTdfYQ,119280,120880,down the middle this time zawinski did
y-vrYoTdfYQ,120880,122000,not miss it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,122000,122799,yeah
y-vrYoTdfYQ,122799,125040,no big tall wall like at pnc park out
y-vrYoTdfYQ,125040,127680,there runner third just one out here's
y-vrYoTdfYQ,127680,130080,fan meters first at bat
y-vrYoTdfYQ,130080,131920,2-2
y-vrYoTdfYQ,131920,133840,in the air to center plenty deep to give
y-vrYoTdfYQ,133840,136000,the pirates the lead
y-vrYoTdfYQ,136000,139280,thomas will make the catch
y-vrYoTdfYQ,139599,142000,both runners will move up and josh van
y-vrYoTdfYQ,142000,144959,meter makes an impact immediately with
y-vrYoTdfYQ,144959,146640,his glove and with his bat it's one
y-vrYoTdfYQ,146640,148800,nothing he drives in his 10th run of the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,148800,150080,year
y-vrYoTdfYQ,150080,153280,so two walks after the double play ball
y-vrYoTdfYQ,153280,154959,just when the pirates thought yahoo ray
y-vrYoTdfYQ,154959,156720,might be out of the inning quickly now
y-vrYoTdfYQ,156720,159360,josh bell
y-vrYoTdfYQ,159360,161680,and bell will bounce it and that ball
y-vrYoTdfYQ,161680,163440,booted by van meter
y-vrYoTdfYQ,163440,165840,race to the bag safe is the call
y-vrYoTdfYQ,165840,167519,by jeremy rehack
y-vrYoTdfYQ,167519,170000,and we hope josh is okay as he awkwardly
y-vrYoTdfYQ,170000,171200,hit the bag
y-vrYoTdfYQ,171200,172800,trying to keep the ending alive it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,172800,174400,appears he has
y-vrYoTdfYQ,174400,176720,this isn't so much van meter booting it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,176720,179120,it's that yahuray didn't even move off
y-vrYoTdfYQ,179120,181040,the mound for two or three steps and
y-vrYoTdfYQ,181040,183040,josh bell yep he beat him when he got
y-vrYoTdfYQ,183040,185840,the toe wow a long toenail that's down a
y-vrYoTdfYQ,185840,188000,run cruz trying to do something about it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,188000,190800,sitting on 43 runs batted in and a ball
y-vrYoTdfYQ,190800,192879,hit hard up the middle that one knocked
y-vrYoTdfYQ,192879,195599,down by park and they get the out at
y-vrYoTdfYQ,195599,196480,second
y-vrYoTdfYQ,196480,198319,one hit an error three left for
y-vrYoTdfYQ,198319,199920,washington will go to the fourth one
y-vrYoTdfYQ,199920,201360,nothing pirates
y-vrYoTdfYQ,201360,203760,so here's yadiel hernandez who has
y-vrYoTdfYQ,203760,205760,oppo popped to the gap and they move
y-vrYoTdfYQ,205760,208480,reynolds over about 10 feet
y-vrYoTdfYQ,208480,210080,that's well hit and it's tailing away
y-vrYoTdfYQ,210080,212640,from zawinski can't get there
y-vrYoTdfYQ,212640,216080,it'll take a big hop up into the seats
y-vrYoTdfYQ,216080,219360,yadiel hernandez blistering one to left
y-vrYoTdfYQ,219360,221200,and an answer in business with second
y-vrYoTdfYQ,221200,224480,and third what a piece of hitting
y-vrYoTdfYQ,224480,227920,changeup down and away off the plate
y-vrYoTdfYQ,227920,230000,and he just hammers this look at his
y-vrYoTdfYQ,230000,232159,whole body just going towards that left
y-vrYoTdfYQ,232159,233680,field foul line
y-vrYoTdfYQ,233680,235360,so the nets need a two out hit from lane
y-vrYoTdfYQ,235360,237599,thomas infield moves back runners second
y-vrYoTdfYQ,237599,240879,and third here's the pitch
y-vrYoTdfYQ,240879,242239,and
y-vrYoTdfYQ,242239,244640,maybe playable meter over
y-vrYoTdfYQ,244640,248239,and van meter is there so you hurry
y-vrYoTdfYQ,248239,250000,works his way out of it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,250000,253040,two outs for o'neill cruz case been in
y-vrYoTdfYQ,253040,256560,the minors for most of the season
y-vrYoTdfYQ,257519,259919,and that's line to right center field
y-vrYoTdfYQ,259919,262960,look at this laser oh my
y-vrYoTdfYQ,262960,264240,oh my
y-vrYoTdfYQ,264240,266479,there's the first of the season

y-vrYoTdfYQ,268800,270400,wow
y-vrYoTdfYQ,270400,272800,they are stunned
y-vrYoTdfYQ,272800,274560,a two iron
y-vrYoTdfYQ,274560,277000,over the right center field wall
y-vrYoTdfYQ,277000,278800,109
y-vrYoTdfYQ,278800,281759,19 degrees
y-vrYoTdfYQ,281759,283360,that's one that like in the old days
y-vrYoTdfYQ,283360,285759,they they talk about the second baseman
y-vrYoTdfYQ,285759,287440,jumped forward and it went out of the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,287440,290479,ballpark that's the sick pop of o'neill
y-vrYoTdfYQ,290479,293360,cruz there's nelson cruz we're back to
y-vrYoTdfYQ,293360,296639,that make him pay for a walk thing and
y-vrYoTdfYQ,296639,298960,nelly takes that one off the lower leg
y-vrYoTdfYQ,298960,300800,or the foot
y-vrYoTdfYQ,300800,303039,and it staggers him because he's not
y-vrYoTdfYQ,303039,304080,getting up
y-vrYoTdfYQ,304080,306880,and he might not finish this at bat
y-vrYoTdfYQ,306880,310360,sinker 95.
y-vrYoTdfYQ,314960,317440,up the middle ball near the bag
y-vrYoTdfYQ,317440,319759,a little in between hop and once he got
y-vrYoTdfYQ,319759,322479,it cruz knew he had time for the throw
y-vrYoTdfYQ,322479,327199,our stop one for two as garcia leads off
y-vrYoTdfYQ,327440,331280,garcia right center well hits
y-vrYoTdfYQ,331600,333440,just a little short from those guys
y-vrYoTdfYQ,333440,336160,catching it and probably dropping it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,336160,338479,and he's into second with a leadoff
y-vrYoTdfYQ,338479,339520,double
y-vrYoTdfYQ,339520,340880,left center now

y-vrYoTdfYQ,361199,363199,park
y-vrYoTdfYQ,363199,366160,but on rbi number 27 the nets are on the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,366160,368400,board a 2-1 game you're throwing the
y-vrYoTdfYQ,368400,369280,ball
y-vrYoTdfYQ,369280,371919,150 feet that's a longer throw than when

y-vrYoTdfYQ,373600,376560,double get him over get him in beautiful
y-vrYoTdfYQ,376560,380080,and now it's josh bell
y-vrYoTdfYQ,380080,382080,bell will keep it going with the base it
y-vrYoTdfYQ,382080,384639,up the middle two outs but juan soto has

y-vrYoTdfYQ,396080,397120,game
y-vrYoTdfYQ,397120,398960,by the nationals and it comes at a very
y-vrYoTdfYQ,398960,400319,key time
