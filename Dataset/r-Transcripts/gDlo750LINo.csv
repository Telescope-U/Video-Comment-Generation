gDlo750LINo,523,4885,(upbeat jazz music) (guests chattering)
gDlo750LINo,4885,7947,(cutlery clanking)
gDlo750LINo,7947,9634,"- Hello, welcome to the channel."
gDlo750LINo,9634,10885,- You know what this is.
gDlo750LINo,10885,12052,Chef. Normals.
gDlo750LINo,12926,13759,Gadgets.
gDlo750LINo,15117,16990,(upbeat music)
gDlo750LINo,16990,18031,"- What we can guarantee though,"
gDlo750LINo,18031,20374,is that we will all be whelmed.
gDlo750LINo,20374,21725,"Perhaps over, perhaps under."
gDlo750LINo,21725,23266,We'll find out.
gDlo750LINo,23266,25677,- It's an accurate description of these videos.
gDlo750LINo,25677,27109,- The bar has been set.
gDlo750LINo,27109,29105,(upbeat music continues)
gDlo750LINo,29105,30272,"Mike, lift it."
gDlo750LINo,32479,33931,- What?
gDlo750LINo,33931,36093,"- Yes, yes and yes."
gDlo750LINo,36093,37078,- [Mike] What is in that?
gDlo750LINo,37078,37990,"- [Barry] Cool. Try it on, mate."
gDlo750LINo,37991,38923,- Is that chain mail?
gDlo750LINo,38923,40861,- Is this your attempt to whelm me?
gDlo750LINo,40861,42052,(all laugh)
gDlo750LINo,42052,42885,"- Go on, put it on."
gDlo750LINo,42885,43996,- What? What?
gDlo750LINo,43997,45730,"- You know how it works, say what you see."
gDlo750LINo,45730,48030,"- There's a little pendant that says ""Roast Easy"""
gDlo750LINo,48030,50697,"and it's chain mail, it's heavy."
gDlo750LINo,52092,53382,- You're right. It's chain mail.
gDlo750LINo,53382,56140,"And now what would you usually use chain mail for, Michael?"
gDlo750LINo,56140,58235,(Barry laughs) - To protect me in battle?
gDlo750LINo,58235,60453,"- Yeah, it's used for body protection against swords"
gDlo750LINo,60453,62531,and even can fend off a few dragons.
gDlo750LINo,62532,65917,"But if that dragon were to burn you or to cook you,"
gDlo750LINo,65917,67736,you'd be cooked to perfection.
gDlo750LINo,67736,69147,- What?
gDlo750LINo,69147,70147,(Mike laughs)
gDlo750LINo,70147,71630,"- Yeah, this is the very clever"
gDlo750LINo,71630,74625,Roast Easy stainless steel chain mail.
gDlo750LINo,74625,78673,It eliminates the use of aluminium foil and is reusable.
gDlo750LINo,78674,81602,"Plus, you could also baste your meat once you've covered it."
gDlo750LINo,81602,85246,And it says it keeps your meat nice and soft and succulent
gDlo750LINo,85247,87647,"but at the same time, crisp on the outside."
gDlo750LINo,87647,90708,- It's replacing aluminium foil?
gDlo750LINo,90708,91666,"- Should we find out? - But it's got little holes,"
gDlo750LINo,91666,93374,so it's not.
gDlo750LINo,93374,95464,- Should we find out?
gDlo750LINo,95464,98213,So we would like you to roast some chickens.
gDlo750LINo,98213,100677,"- Question is, Baz, are we comparing chain mail to tin foil"
gDlo750LINo,100678,103094,or chain mail just to naked?
gDlo750LINo,103094,106518,- It states that it is a good replacement for tin foil.
gDlo750LINo,106518,111518,"And the use of tin foil, personally, is to keep the heat in."
gDlo750LINo,111955,116295,"And most importantly, the moisture as well,  to get succulent chicken."
gDlo750LINo,116295,117846,- But the chain mail has holes in it.
gDlo750LINo,117846,120846,"- I know, but that's what it states."
gDlo750LINo,122425,124620,Let's get them ready for battle
gDlo750LINo,124620,125604,(Ben laughs) or roasting.
gDlo750LINo,127561,132413,"- Arise, Sir Clucks-a-lot. (Barry laughs)"
gDlo750LINo,132413,135504,This will go in the bin after I've used it.
gDlo750LINo,135504,136801,That. - Might also.
gDlo750LINo,136801,139601,We'll see how good it is.
gDlo750LINo,139601,142457,"- [Barry] Okay. Well, would you mind roasting these for us?"
gDlo750LINo,142457,143346,- Absolutely.
gDlo750LINo,143346,144178,"- [Barry] So if you now you got two chickens,"
gDlo750LINo,144179,148046,"both cooked at 200 for about an hour-ish,"
gDlo750LINo,148046,150985,"and one under your chain mail,"
gDlo750LINo,150985,153758,"that under tin foil, please reveal."
gDlo750LINo,153758,157297,- I did get the chain mail chicken out halfway through
gDlo750LINo,157298,158252,and basted it.
gDlo750LINo,158252,159084,- [Barry] Yeah. Yeah.
gDlo750LINo,159085,159918,- I didn't do that with that
gDlo750LINo,159918,161797,cause I couldn't be bothered to remove it.
gDlo750LINo,161797,162629,- [Mike] Ready?
gDlo750LINo,162630,163463,- [Barry] Go for it.
gDlo750LINo,163463,165517,"- Three, two, one."
gDlo750LINo,165517,167040,- What you're noticing visually?
gDlo750LINo,167040,168549,- I'm noticing visually
gDlo750LINo,168550,171643,that the breast area of the chain mailed
gDlo750LINo,171643,174613,Sir chicken has browned a lot more.
gDlo750LINo,174613,176784,And that could have been to do with the basting.
gDlo750LINo,176784,179213,"- Well, the theory behind the tin foil is"
gDlo750LINo,179213,181774,that you are kind of half steaming the chicken as
gDlo750LINo,181774,183577,well to keep the juiciness in.
gDlo750LINo,183577,186963,Whereas the chain mail is more open to the elements.
gDlo750LINo,186964,188184,So it browns more.
gDlo750LINo,188184,189017,- Let's find out.
gDlo750LINo,189017,190987,I'll carve it.
gDlo750LINo,190988,193113,- You try and teach him a better way.
gDlo750LINo,193113,194335,"- I know how to do it, Ebbers,"
gDlo750LINo,194335,195845,I've got a badge for it.
gDlo750LINo,195845,198092,I mean it's perfectly cooked
gDlo750LINo,198092,200685,"- [Ben] If you're carving it, remove the wishbone"
gDlo750LINo,200686,205037,before you roast and take the leg off before you carve
gDlo750LINo,205037,207108,and you'll get those perfect slices that cut
gDlo750LINo,207108,208218,through the whole breast.
gDlo750LINo,208218,210322,You don't end up with sort of chunks at either end
gDlo750LINo,210322,212654,"- I just wanna clarify that I know that,"
gDlo750LINo,212654,215858,I just wanted to get some breast slices quick.
gDlo750LINo,215858,216691,- I agree.
gDlo750LINo,216691,218948,- But you made it sound like I was doing it wrong.
gDlo750LINo,218948,220125,- You were doing it wrong.
gDlo750LINo,220125,220958,(Barry laughs)
gDlo750LINo,220958,222109,"- I chose to do it wrong, Ebbers"
gDlo750LINo,222110,223359,- Skin sounds a lot crispier.
gDlo750LINo,223359,224187,- [Mike] Yeah.
gDlo750LINo,224188,226380,-It did leave a mottled chain mail effect.
gDlo750LINo,226380,233185,"- It didn't, I was really hoping it would take in very similar colours and juiciness,"
gDlo750LINo,233185,234535,I would say.
gDlo750LINo,234535,237334,"Okay, I'm gonna say it now."
gDlo750LINo,237334,239357,I'm not sure there's gonna be a huge amount
gDlo750LINo,239357,240939,of difference here.
gDlo750LINo,242784,244609,Like absolute delicious.
gDlo750LINo,244609,246359,"Succulent, delicious."
gDlo750LINo,248120,249134,Very similar
gDlo750LINo,249134,250616,- Succulent and delicious.
gDlo750LINo,250616,252224,- The skin is brown up.
gDlo750LINo,252224,253503,It's slightly crispier.
gDlo750LINo,253503,255016,Is there a huge amount of difference?
gDlo750LINo,255016,256624,I don't think there is
gDlo750LINo,256624,257522,- Brilliant.
gDlo750LINo,257523,258672,That's what we're looking for.
gDlo750LINo,258672,260961,"To compare it to tin foil, it's doing the job."
gDlo750LINo,260961,262668,But you don't have to throw this away.
gDlo750LINo,262668,264719,You can just wash it and use it again.
gDlo750LINo,264719,267090,- [Ben] It's a nice seasonal veg squashed
gDlo750LINo,267090,270792,roasted lemony potatoes and a lovely little sauce.
gDlo750LINo,270792,272802,- Should we talk about price?
gDlo750LINo,272803,275311,"- Okay, If I were to use it"
gDlo750LINo,275311,277161,I don't think I'd want pay anything more
gDlo750LINo,277161,279599,than £15  for it. Am I close?
gDlo750LINo,279599,281016,"- [Barry] No, no."
gDlo750LINo,282056,285223,"You nowhere near mate, it's £44."
gDlo750LINo,286396,287590,- Okay.
gDlo750LINo,287590,289307,- So now you've tasted it.
gDlo750LINo,289308,292204,"You know the price, is it rise Sir Clucks-a-lot"
gDlo750LINo,292204,294296,or is it down to the dungeon?
gDlo750LINo,294296,296599,- For me personally in the application
gDlo750LINo,296600,298000,"in which I would use it or not,"
gDlo750LINo,298000,300275,it would be down to the dungeon
gDlo750LINo,300275,301494,- For reference for a bit of Googling.
gDlo750LINo,301494,304876,You can also buy this for £47.
gDlo750LINo,304877,306139,"- [Ben] Brilliant purchase off Etsy,"
gDlo750LINo,306139,307056,I want one.
gDlo750LINo,309576,310466,"- [Jamie] Right then, Ebbers"
gDlo750LINo,310466,313649,this has been highly requested by the community.
gDlo750LINo,313649,314802,"Not for us to review,"
gDlo750LINo,314802,318530,but for you specifically to review.
gDlo750LINo,318530,319737,- It's either allotment based
gDlo750LINo,319737,320737,or it's gonna wind me up.
gDlo750LINo,320737,321570,One of the two.
gDlo750LINo,321570,322564,- That's such an assumption.
gDlo750LINo,322564,323397,"- I know, come on."
gDlo750LINo,323397,324827,- Come into this with an open mind
gDlo750LINo,324827,326994,- [Jamie] Lift the cloche.
gDlo750LINo,328334,330442,- Well it's plastic enough to be a kitchen gadget
gDlo750LINo,330442,331936,on this channel.
gDlo750LINo,331937,334517,(upbeat music continues)
gDlo750LINo,334517,336100,"- Oh, twisty vents."
gDlo750LINo,337078,341540,Which would suggest it's to keep steam or moisture in.
gDlo750LINo,341540,343481,And then you can unseal.
gDlo750LINo,343481,345397,With some sort of rack.
gDlo750LINo,346521,349021,"Oh slidey, is this air drying,"
gDlo750LINo,349932,351777,or steaming or smoking something?
gDlo750LINo,351777,353147,- Absolutely not.
gDlo750LINo,353147,354144,- Don't know.
gDlo750LINo,354144,356792,"- Ebbers, this is the kitchen craft,"
gDlo750LINo,356792,360952,"Stay fresh, expanding bread keeper and slicer."
gDlo750LINo,360952,364867,"They say, ""Say no to stale bread, kitchen crafts',"
gDlo750LINo,364867,368085,"Stay Fresh, expanding acrylic bread keeper,"
gDlo750LINo,368085,372384,is an ingenious way to keep bread fresh and bouncy.
gDlo750LINo,372385,374550,It even comes with a free slicing guide.
gDlo750LINo,374550,378319,"So you can turn your loaf into a neat tasty sandwich""."
gDlo750LINo,378320,380727,- So you're saying this is a smart bread bin?
gDlo750LINo,380727,382143,- Yes and slicer.
gDlo750LINo,383126,385590,- This might be the best thing until sliced bread.
gDlo750LINo,385590,388130,- Yeah. Say no. - Say no.
gDlo750LINo,388131,391323,- Say no to stale. - Say no to stale
gDlo750LINo,391323,393211,- [Jamie] So keep it in its little box.
gDlo750LINo,393211,394966,"- As a bread bin, thoughts?"
gDlo750LINo,394966,396050,- So it's a bread bin.
gDlo750LINo,396050,398186,"And the good thing is, you don't have to open the lid"
gDlo750LINo,398187,400009,of the bread bin to work out how much bread you got left.
gDlo750LINo,400009,401733,- See through. - See through.
gDlo750LINo,401733,403426,- See he's finding the positives already.
gDlo750LINo,403426,404259,- Yeah. Good.
gDlo750LINo,404259,405277,"- Yeah. Yes, Ebbers"
gDlo750LINo,405277,406566,"- [Jamie] Well it says, Ebbers,"
gDlo750LINo,406566,408305,it's got a versatile expanding design though
gDlo750LINo,408305,409430,- [Ben] It's not air tight.
gDlo750LINo,409430,410914,I don't really understand what this is doing
gDlo750LINo,410914,411989,because this isn't airtight.
gDlo750LINo,411989,414437,- It lets bread breathe.
gDlo750LINo,414437,416025,- So the bread keeper is designed
gDlo750LINo,416025,417559,to keep your loaves protected.
gDlo750LINo,417559,420038,"But at the same time, lets the bread breathe"
gDlo750LINo,420038,423444,which helps to prevent mould and staleness.
gDlo750LINo,423444,426120,"- Because if you keep bread wrapped up in its,"
gDlo750LINo,426120,428552,"you know, in the, the plastic that it comes in,"
gDlo750LINo,428552,429820,if you leave it in a hot place.
gDlo750LINo,429820,432156,You get condensation on the inside of the wrapper.
gDlo750LINo,432156,433197,Actually that leads to mould.
gDlo750LINo,433197,434716,- Where are you taking it into a shower?
gDlo750LINo,434717,437891,- Why is your kitchen so hot and steamy?
gDlo750LINo,437891,440237,"As a see-through expandable bread bin,"
gDlo750LINo,440237,442195,it fits a loaf of bread.
gDlo750LINo,442195,443028,- Well done.
gDlo750LINo,443028,445379,- Shall we look at the other functionality?
gDlo750LINo,445379,448835,Let's use it to help us slice bread evenly.
gDlo750LINo,448835,449959,"So as they say, Ebbers"
gDlo750LINo,449959,453334,the bread keeper comes with a robust slicing guide.
gDlo750LINo,453334,455348,So you can enjoy that home baked taste
gDlo750LINo,455348,457733,without struggling to slice properly.
gDlo750LINo,457733,459331,Simply place your bread inside
gDlo750LINo,459331,462867,and the grooves guide your bread knife to cut even slices.
gDlo750LINo,462867,465784,"It's simple, safe, and easy to use."
gDlo750LINo,467190,468612,- It's doing quite an even job
gDlo750LINo,468612,469445,- Right. Coming in.
gDlo750LINo,469445,471486,I wanna see how straight these slices are.
gDlo750LINo,471486,472580,- I thought that's pretty good going
gDlo750LINo,472580,473413,- Look at that.
gDlo750LINo,473413,476541,It's like you bought it from a bakery.
gDlo750LINo,476541,478995,- The good news is they're all the same thickness.
gDlo750LINo,478995,481214,So when you make your sandwiches.
gDlo750LINo,481214,482047,- That is actually.
gDlo750LINo,482047,482880,Yeah.
gDlo750LINo,482880,484573,"- It's no, it can't be."
gDlo750LINo,484573,487152,- And it fits pretty perfect.
gDlo750LINo,487152,491402,"Oh, sort of late spring little humidity in the air,"
gDlo750LINo,492438,494815,a sort of solid 20 degree average.
gDlo750LINo,494816,497237,I'll have the vents open a little bit.
gDlo750LINo,497237,498709,- And I'll tell you something.
gDlo750LINo,498709,499731,- He's mocking you to your face.
gDlo750LINo,499731,501580,"- Not, he's not, he's getting into it."
gDlo750LINo,501580,503055,And I'll tell you something for nothing.
gDlo750LINo,503055,505647,"2,363 people on Amazon."
gDlo750LINo,505647,507580,Agree with him.
gDlo750LINo,507580,508870,- I cannot deny.
gDlo750LINo,508870,510109,- This is ludicrous.
gDlo750LINo,510109,513416,- That does exactly what it says on the bread bin.
gDlo750LINo,513416,515049,I'm not sure if it's needed.
gDlo750LINo,515049,517334,"I'm not sure if I'd want it on my work surface,"
gDlo750LINo,517334,518474,but it works.
gDlo750LINo,518474,519648,- The question is Ebbers.
gDlo750LINo,519648,523312,How much would you be willing to pay for the bread bin?
gDlo750LINo,523312,527881,"- A really nice bread bin would set you back £20, £30."
gDlo750LINo,527881,531667,"This is not a really nice bread bin, but maybe 18?"
gDlo750LINo,531667,532500,- 18?
gDlo750LINo,532500,533414,- 18.
gDlo750LINo,533414,535831,- [Jamie] It's only £16
gDlo750LINo,538163,539438,- Bargain.
gDlo750LINo,539438,541198,- Sorry what is happening here?
gDlo750LINo,541198,542245,"- No, let me tell you this."
gDlo750LINo,542245,543086,This loaf of bread.
gDlo750LINo,543086,545614,I mean an 800 gramme farmhouse loaf.
gDlo750LINo,545614,547684,What's that gonna set you back?
gDlo750LINo,547684,549729,- We paid £1.60 for that loaf.
gDlo750LINo,549729,551782,- So if half of it remains fresher for longer
gDlo750LINo,551782,554544,you could save 80 P every single week across a year.
gDlo750LINo,554544,556843,The bread bin pays for itself multiple times over.
gDlo750LINo,556843,561106,"- At this rate, that's gonna be a ""Sorted"" endorsed product."
gDlo750LINo,561106,562189,"- No, it's not."
gDlo750LINo,562189,564761,"- Let's reign it back a little bit, come on."
gDlo750LINo,564761,566794,- Ebber's the only question that remains.
gDlo750LINo,566794,569687,Is this a straight up slice of genius?
gDlo750LINo,569687,572270,Or is it superfluous and stale?
gDlo750LINo,573358,576058,- The design and the execution means
gDlo750LINo,576058,577984,"that it is a slice of genius,"
gDlo750LINo,577984,581096,but I think it's a hundred percent superfluous.
gDlo750LINo,581096,583013,"- Oh good, thank goodness."
gDlo750LINo,583013,583887,- I think that's fair.
gDlo750LINo,583887,585591,(upbeat music continues)
gDlo750LINo,585591,586553,- What's in your sandwich?
gDlo750LINo,586553,587738,- Cheeky little crab sandwich.
gDlo750LINo,587739,589525,"- Oh, you're an such Ebbers."
gDlo750LINo,589525,593025,"- Okay Jay, number three, lift the cloche."
gDlo750LINo,594042,598570,- What on earth are you going to do with that?
gDlo750LINo,598570,600472,- I want you to work out what it's for
gDlo750LINo,600472,601594,and what you're gonna put in it.
gDlo750LINo,601594,602594,"- Oh, oh, oh"
gDlo750LINo,603779,606362,- There's a clue hidden inside.
gDlo750LINo,607275,608652,- Bamboo sticks.
gDlo750LINo,608652,610324,"- Suddenly everything becomes clear, right?"
gDlo750LINo,610325,611158,- Skewers.
gDlo750LINo,611158,613528,- It's a giant toothpick holder.
gDlo750LINo,613528,614725,- I'm gonna be honest.
gDlo750LINo,614725,616600,I have absolutely no idea.
gDlo750LINo,616601,618794,Apart from some very rude things that I will not say
gDlo750LINo,618794,619627,on this channel.
gDlo750LINo,619627,622931,"- [Mike] Well, Jay, this is in fact the Easy Kebab maker"
gDlo750LINo,622931,626040,the perfect gadget for anyone who loves barbecue
gDlo750LINo,626040,628865,or grilling complete with skewers.
gDlo750LINo,628865,633556,So there you have absolute delicious Kebab mix.
gDlo750LINo,633556,634592,Fill the tube.
gDlo750LINo,634592,636404,"So step one, remove the plunger from the tube."
gDlo750LINo,636404,637362,You've done that.
gDlo750LINo,637362,639005,"- Step two, disassemble the plunger,"
gDlo750LINo,639005,640525,and remove the skewers.
gDlo750LINo,640525,642228,"Reassemble the plunger, done."
gDlo750LINo,642228,644709,"Step three, which is what you are doing now,"
gDlo750LINo,644709,647404,is fill the tube with mince meat.
gDlo750LINo,647404,649010,"You don't need to use two fingers, do you?"
gDlo750LINo,649010,650698,Like it just.
gDlo750LINo,650698,655141,Place the tube on top of the plunger and press down
gDlo750LINo,655141,658261,until the mince meat enters the nozzle chamber.
gDlo750LINo,658262,659470,"- It's coming through, yep."
gDlo750LINo,659470,662865,"- So next, insert a skewer into the hole at the back"
gDlo750LINo,662866,667181,of the nozzle and continue to press down over the plunger.
gDlo750LINo,667181,670024,And then as the mince meat emerges from the nozzle.
gDlo750LINo,670024,671955,It moulds itself around the skewer
gDlo750LINo,671955,673506,"creating a kebab. - Oh, oh."
gDlo750LINo,673506,674977,- Oh my goodness.
gDlo750LINo,674978,675811,"- Oh, oh."
gDlo750LINo,677379,678896,"- Okay, Jay."
gDlo750LINo,678896,680213,- Okay then do I pinch it off?
gDlo750LINo,680213,681046,- Stop it.
gDlo750LINo,681921,683498,It doesn't say.
gDlo750LINo,683498,686953,"- Five, six inches maybe, I dunno."
gDlo750LINo,686953,690914,"- [Ben] Oh, I think pinch rather than just bend."
gDlo750LINo,690914,692682,"- [Barry] Oh, you actually have to pitch it off."
gDlo750LINo,692682,693890,- Oh God.
gDlo750LINo,693890,695021,- Okay. You can mould that.
gDlo750LINo,695021,695854,You can save that.
gDlo750LINo,695854,697187,There you go.
gDlo750LINo,697187,699124,"- [Ben] That was an easy, perfect kebab."
gDlo750LINo,699124,700343,- It was. what's happening?
gDlo750LINo,700343,702647,These things are impressing us.
gDlo750LINo,702647,703480,- [Barry] No stick.
gDlo750LINo,703480,705730,- [Ben] Jamie's got a plan.
gDlo750LINo,705731,706759,- Oh god.
gDlo750LINo,706759,710326,We've done some stuff on this channel but.
gDlo750LINo,710326,711469,"- [Barry] Ah, well done."
gDlo750LINo,711469,712302,Nailed it.
gDlo750LINo,712302,713135,- Okay.
gDlo750LINo,713135,715122,"- And just out of interest, can you do one by hand?"
gDlo750LINo,715122,716372,- [Jamie] Yeah.
gDlo750LINo,717326,719144,- I didn't think I'd catch myself saying this
gDlo750LINo,719144,722630,but I think actually it looks a lot better.
gDlo750LINo,722630,724382,You got smoking pan there.
gDlo750LINo,724382,727549,(rock and roll music)
gDlo750LINo,731469,732302,- Cheers.
gDlo750LINo,733927,735941,- Still holding onto the stick.
gDlo750LINo,735941,736774,- Wow.
gDlo750LINo,736774,738488,"- Good structural integrity there, isn't there?"
gDlo750LINo,738488,739496,"- Yeah, there is."
gDlo750LINo,739496,741034,"Which I don't think you get, you know"
gDlo750LINo,741034,742492,when you mould it by hand.
gDlo750LINo,742492,744323,- This slides off the stick.
gDlo750LINo,744323,745156,- Oh
gDlo750LINo,745156,746489,"- Oh, interesting."
gDlo750LINo,746489,749451,"- Having used it, cooked with what it made,"
gDlo750LINo,749451,750284,eaten that.
gDlo750LINo,750284,751651,What are your thoughts?
gDlo750LINo,751651,752911,- It really works.
gDlo750LINo,752911,754395,- Would you genuinely have that?
gDlo750LINo,754395,755803,Would you take that home
gDlo750LINo,755803,757458,and honestly get it out and use it?
gDlo750LINo,757458,758318,- I would use that.
gDlo750LINo,758318,760581,- So not only does we review a lot
gDlo750LINo,760581,762484,"of these things, we're like, Hey, it does what it says."
gDlo750LINo,762484,765079,"I wouldn't have one, but this does what it says."
gDlo750LINo,765079,766748,And you would use it?
gDlo750LINo,766749,767838,- I think I would use that.
gDlo750LINo,767838,769840,Yeah. It's fun for grownups and for children.
gDlo750LINo,769840,771091,- Shall we talk price?
gDlo750LINo,771091,772719,How much would you pay for this?
gDlo750LINo,772719,774339,- When it comes with the skewers?
gDlo750LINo,774339,775423,- Exactly.
gDlo750LINo,775423,776423,- £15.
gDlo750LINo,777474,780184,- [Mike] This is priced at £24.97.
gDlo750LINo,780184,782221,Does that change your opinion of it?
gDlo750LINo,782221,785397,"- £25 Isn't enough to put me off buying it,"
gDlo750LINo,785397,787363,"but it is enough to make me think twice,"
gDlo750LINo,787363,788537,but now I've tried it.
gDlo750LINo,788537,790440,£25 is alright.
gDlo750LINo,790440,791273,- Well.
gDlo750LINo,791273,792307,- What sorry?
gDlo750LINo,792307,793808,"- Barry, where are you in this video?"
gDlo750LINo,793808,797435,- I don't know where I am in the world right now.
gDlo750LINo,797435,800442,"If you use it every week, I understand."
gDlo750LINo,800442,804969,But your kebab that you made by hand wasn't that much worse.
gDlo750LINo,804969,805977,- It fell off the stick.
gDlo750LINo,805977,808810,(everyone laughs)
gDlo750LINo,810403,811562,- Okay.
gDlo750LINo,811562,815048,"- We're all thinking this, the Easy Kebab Maker"
gDlo750LINo,815048,816173,complete with skewers.
gDlo750LINo,816173,818089,Has it doner good job?
gDlo750LINo,819071,819904,- Yes.
gDlo750LINo,819904,821067,- [Mike] Or is it not worth the plunge?
gDlo750LINo,821067,824076,"- Oh, that is my favourite one for a long time."
gDlo750LINo,824076,825994,I think you know where I'm gonna go with this.
gDlo750LINo,825994,830827,I think it's doner good job and it's gonna come in handy.
gDlo750LINo,832667,833515,- Next.
gDlo750LINo,833515,834707,(eclectic music)
gDlo750LINo,834707,835733,- We're on a roll here.
gDlo750LINo,835733,836691,- What we are.
gDlo750LINo,836691,837816,"- Hey, come on."
gDlo750LINo,837816,839620,- You've got your work cut out with him.
gDlo750LINo,839620,840453,- Turn me around.
gDlo750LINo,840453,841514,"No, that's not what?"
gDlo750LINo,841514,842514,"No, no I no."
gDlo750LINo,846437,848604,"- Mr. Taylor, number four."
gDlo750LINo,849754,851634,- A mini Kebab maker?
gDlo750LINo,851634,856467,"- Okay. It feels, it looks like a weird looking cork screw"
gDlo750LINo,857667,862067,"or pepper grinder, but plunges and doesn't screw."
gDlo750LINo,862067,867061,This is like something you use to plug something.
gDlo750LINo,867061,870964,- This is a Vacu Vin.
gDlo750LINo,871138,873686,"- Oh, a wine vacuum."
gDlo750LINo,874599,877572,- It is a wine saver and stopper.
gDlo750LINo,877572,881030,- Wine stopper? Okay. Does it cork?
gDlo750LINo,881030,884170,- [Ben] So Vacu Vin is the number one wine accessory
gDlo750LINo,884170,885281,on Amazon.
gDlo750LINo,885281,888085,"So many people would say it does and they claim,"
gDlo750LINo,888085,891116,it will keep wine preserved up to 10 days.
gDlo750LINo,891116,894410,"So you'll be glad to know that nine days ago,"
gDlo750LINo,894410,896789,we opened two identical bottles of wine.
gDlo750LINo,896789,898076,"Poured out a couple of glasses,"
gDlo750LINo,898076,900127,"Vacu sealed one,"
gDlo750LINo,900127,902443,and left a regular cork in the other.
gDlo750LINo,902443,904162,Two bottles of Flurie.
gDlo750LINo,904162,905854,"one, we opened."
gDlo750LINo,905854,908103,"The other one, we poured out a similar amount"
gDlo750LINo,908103,909804,and then sealed it.
gDlo750LINo,909804,912386,- So where's the line between letting wine breathe
gDlo750LINo,912386,914386,and being out of breath?
gDlo750LINo,915120,916848,(laughing)
gDlo750LINo,918918,921321,- Such an excellent way of putting it.
gDlo750LINo,921321,923665,Oxidation is an important part of wine ageing
gDlo750LINo,923665,925248,and processing in a barrel.
gDlo750LINo,925248,927282,"It might be wine type, but it's not oxygen type."
gDlo750LINo,927282,931329,"So it's slow, steady application of oxygen,"
gDlo750LINo,931330,932950,"which is where you get ageing and oaking,"
gDlo750LINo,932950,934291,and all that kind of wonderful stuff.
gDlo750LINo,934291,936045,"At home, if it's then been trapped in a bottle,"
gDlo750LINo,936045,938672,"the cork is also very slightly breathable,"
gDlo750LINo,938672,940342,"which is why over a long period of time,"
gDlo750LINo,940342,942969,wine can go past its best.
gDlo750LINo,942969,944723,But it's also been trapped in a bottle.
gDlo750LINo,944723,949580,So you want to release it to give it a chance to come back
gDlo750LINo,949580,952928,"to life for a little while, half an hour, an hour,"
gDlo750LINo,952928,955190,but day or two or three or seven.
gDlo750LINo,955190,957940,And it will start to deteriorate.
gDlo750LINo,959391,961701,"- Oh, that was..."
gDlo750LINo,961702,963333,"- Okay. The Vacu version,"
gDlo750LINo,963333,966094,it ever so slightly more burgundy.
gDlo750LINo,966094,970126,"The other has lost some of that deep colour,"
gDlo750LINo,970126,972793,and is ever so gently more rosy.
gDlo750LINo,974409,975502,"- They, well, how do they smell?"
gDlo750LINo,975502,978085,- Look at me just for a second.
gDlo750LINo,980434,982427,- Is it clear and obvious?
gDlo750LINo,982427,986010,- There is more coming from this than that.
gDlo750LINo,987682,990812,All I'm getting is more like there's something else
gDlo750LINo,990812,991751,that the other lost.
gDlo750LINo,991751,993834,I couldn't put my nose on what that bit is.
gDlo750LINo,993834,995076,- Have a taste the first one.
gDlo750LINo,995076,997089,- [Mike] What you getting from that first one?
gDlo750LINo,997089,998680,Does that taste like red wine?
gDlo750LINo,998680,999768,"Has it, does it taste like it?"
gDlo750LINo,999768,1000601,- It tastes like red wine
gDlo750LINo,1000601,1001585,that's been open for a couple of days.
gDlo750LINo,1001585,1002418,- Oh great.
gDlo750LINo,1002418,1006215,- Like it has that very slight twang like that's.
gDlo750LINo,1006215,1007156,- [Mike] That you were talking about earlier.
gDlo750LINo,1007156,1008100,- That's absolutely drinkable.
gDlo750LINo,1008100,1009440,I wouldn't put that in a bolognese yet.
gDlo750LINo,1009440,1010523,- [Ben] Okay.
gDlo750LINo,1014523,1017659,"- Oh, that's actually quite a significant amount"
gDlo750LINo,1017659,1019279,of difference in the taste.
gDlo750LINo,1019279,1021659,Compared to what I was getting through colour and smell.
gDlo750LINo,1021659,1023215,"- Are you saying that like in taste,"
gDlo750LINo,1023215,1024386,it holds a taste.
gDlo750LINo,1024386,1026850,But does the wine still deteriorate?
gDlo750LINo,1026850,1028569,Like it doesn't extend the shelf life?
gDlo750LINo,1028569,1030402,- The oxygen in the bottle of which now
gDlo750LINo,1030402,1032042,"instead of being a tiny, tiny bit."
gDlo750LINo,1032042,1036406,"There's two glasses worth, will basically begin to react"
gDlo750LINo,1036406,1038305,with the ethanol and you get that acidic acid.
gDlo750LINo,1038305,1040037,So you get the acidity almost turning
gDlo750LINo,1040037,1041609,"towards a vinegary kind of note,"
gDlo750LINo,1041609,1044470,but also the fresh fruitiness of this kind
gDlo750LINo,1044470,1046906,of wine won't come through more soften.
gDlo750LINo,1046906,1049534,Might feel more like cooked fruit as opposed to fresh fruit.
gDlo750LINo,1049534,1050367,- Gotcha.
gDlo750LINo,1050367,1051247,- Have a plunge
gDlo750LINo,1051248,1053473,"and take the air back out of that bottle,"
gDlo750LINo,1053473,1057431,- [Ben] But keep going until it clicks.
gDlo750LINo,1057431,1058841,"- Oh, I see, it's pushing it down."
gDlo750LINo,1058841,1059674,- [Ben] Little click.
