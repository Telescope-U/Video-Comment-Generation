B_H9kYBBves,2960,4880,boom beautiful all right what's up guys
B_H9kYBBves,4880,6879,in today's video we're gonna try another
B_H9kYBBves,6879,8480,tick tock art challenge i found this
B_H9kYBBves,8480,9760,challenge recently it's a little bit
B_H9kYBBves,9760,11360,different from what we've done before
B_H9kYBBves,11360,12880,but i think this should be really fun to
B_H9kYBBves,12880,14320,do so i'm gonna play this tech talk for
B_H9kYBBves,14320,15519,you guys and you can see what we're
B_H9kYBBves,15519,18950,getting ourselves into
B_H9kYBBves,18950,34170,[Music]
B_H9kYBBves,34399,35440,you probably know what's happening now
B_H9kYBBves,35440,37200,right this is a challenge where you draw
B_H9kYBBves,37200,39840,a character head-on and you divide the
B_H9kYBBves,39840,42000,face into four equal squares and the
B_H9kYBBves,42000,43920,hard part is in each square you gotta
B_H9kYBBves,43920,45760,draw in a different style you know the
B_H9kYBBves,45760,47039,thing with art babies is everyone's
B_H9kYBBves,47039,48160,always talking about how to find your
B_H9kYBBves,48160,51360,art style how do i find it yeah
B_H9kYBBves,51360,53360,and a great way to do that is to try out
B_H9kYBBves,53360,54960,different styles for yourself and see
B_H9kYBBves,54960,56320,what you're comfortable with so this
B_H9kYBBves,56320,58160,challenge is right up my alley i've got
B_H9kYBBves,58160,59840,my oc car here and i've divided this
B_H9kYBBves,59840,62399,portrait into four equal squares where
B_H9kYBBves,62399,64158,we're gonna do a different style in each
B_H9kYBBves,64158,65680,square now i change this up a little bit
B_H9kYBBves,65680,67200,because ain't no way i'm doing pop art
B_H9kYBBves,67200,68720,today i'm just not feeling that and i
B_H9kYBBves,68720,71520,put a blog where it's a me style sam sam
B_H9kYBBves,71520,73200,does art style i hope you guys like my
B_H9kYBBves,73200,75680,style um so the boxes are gonna be my
B_H9kYBBves,75680,78880,style realism anime and disney and when
B_H9kYBBves,78880,80320,i say disney i don't mean like elsa i
B_H9kYBBves,80320,81759,mean like you know the classic like
B_H9kYBBves,81759,83920,ariel which uh most of you guys that's
B_H9kYBBves,83920,85600,probably before your generation so i
B_H9kYBBves,85600,86799,guess with the intro out of the way
B_H9kYBBves,86799,88479,let's jump right into this and i'll talk
B_H9kYBBves,88479,89840,to you guys about all the different
B_H9kYBBves,89840,91520,styles and things to look out for and if
B_H9kYBBves,91520,92799,you're looking for your own style you
B_H9kYBBves,92799,94640,know this this is a great way to find it
B_H9kYBBves,94640,96159,and i'll show you why so i'm going to
B_H9kYBBves,96159,97840,start off with my own style but by the
B_H9kYBBves,97840,99280,end i think you're going to probably see
B_H9kYBBves,99280,101280,a correlation between my style and the
B_H9kYBBves,101280,103360,three other styles listed here get that
B_H9kYBBves,103360,104320,nice
B_H9kYBBves,104320,106640,bright hair color in there beautiful in
B_H9kYBBves,106640,107920,most of my work there's a couple things
B_H9kYBBves,107920,109439,that i like to do which is simplify the
B_H9kYBBves,109439,111759,shapes and exaggerate the colors so i'm
B_H9kYBBves,111759,113119,gonna take the skin color and i'm going
B_H9kYBBves,113119,115360,to add a shadow color let's go a little
B_H9kYBBves,115360,118560,bit darker a little bit warmer and
B_H9kYBBves,118560,120320,right there boom
B_H9kYBBves,120320,121360,shadow
B_H9kYBBves,121360,123360,okay now let's do a shadow on the hair
B_H9kYBBves,123360,125040,let's do a little bit of rendering here
B_H9kYBBves,125040,127040,just a little bit of a darker color not
B_H9kYBBves,127040,128399,too much because we want to keep this
B_H9kYBBves,128399,129920,really simple and we don't want to get
B_H9kYBBves,129920,132959,bogged down with uh you know small tiny
B_H9kYBBves,132959,134800,details not saying that small things
B_H9kYBBves,134800,138400,don't deserve love but you know
B_H9kYBBves,138560,140720,cara's eyes are blue so we're gonna get
B_H9kYBBves,140720,143280,a nice vibrant blue color
B_H9kYBBves,143280,146000,yes that's good that's good um
B_H9kYBBves,146000,147680,i feel like this is a bit too vibrant i
B_H9kYBBves,147680,149040,might be getting carried away let's just
B_H9kYBBves,149040,151040,tone that down a bit okay that looks
B_H9kYBBves,151040,153680,better get a nice dark color for the top
B_H9kYBBves,153680,156640,lid beautiful let's get some
B_H9kYBBves,156640,159120,shading on the iris
B_H9kYBBves,159120,160480,so after this i like to go into the
B_H9kYBBves,160480,161840,eyebrows and i usually treat the
B_H9kYBBves,161840,164080,eyebrows as two big shapes you know just
B_H9kYBBves,164080,166239,no individual hairs because ain't nobody
B_H9kYBBves,166239,168080,got time for that beautiful now let's go
B_H9kYBBves,168080,170879,into the whites of the eyes again simple
B_H9kYBBves,170879,172239,simple rendering and now we're gonna
B_H9kYBBves,172239,174560,pick a light color and we're just gonna
B_H9kYBBves,174560,176239,most of the time when i'm drawing i like
B_H9kYBBves,176239,178080,to keep it really loose and really fast
B_H9kYBBves,178080,180080,so that's why you're gonna see a lot of
B_H9kYBBves,180080,181680,really messy looking lines and
B_H9kYBBves,181680,183599,unfinished looking parts but that's just
B_H9kYBBves,183599,185200,the aesthetic that i like all right
B_H9kYBBves,185200,187280,let's get an airbrush and let's darken
B_H9kYBBves,187280,188959,the upper lid i like to really put a lot
B_H9kYBBves,188959,190720,of emphasis on the upper lid because i
B_H9kYBBves,190720,192400,feel like it really captures the shape
B_H9kYBBves,192400,194239,of the eye let's get some saturation
B_H9kYBBves,194239,195840,between the light and the shadows
B_H9kYBBves,195840,198319,beautiful and then after this we're
B_H9kYBBves,198319,199840,going to go on to the hair in most of my
B_H9kYBBves,199840,201280,drawings i don't really put individual
B_H9kYBBves,201280,203200,strands in the hair they're really there
B_H9kYBBves,203200,204640,as a bit of a finishing touch and i
B_H9kYBBves,204640,206480,treat the hair as one big shape so this
B_H9kYBBves,206480,208879,is really important and then let's add a
B_H9kYBBves,208879,211920,streak of highlight kind of go back into
B_H9kYBBves,211920,213760,it with a round brush
B_H9kYBBves,213760,216239,maybe we can do a bit more
B_H9kYBBves,216239,218319,sharp shadows across the hair and now
B_H9kYBBves,218319,220560,let's do some stylistic strands of hair
B_H9kYBBves,220560,222000,just to show that the silhouette of the
B_H9kYBBves,222000,223599,hair is actually broken up and it's not
B_H9kYBBves,223599,225680,just one big uh clump and you know what
B_H9kYBBves,225680,226959,guys i think this looks pretty good so
B_H9kYBBves,226959,228640,to finish this off let's just add in
B_H9kYBBves,228640,231519,some uh stylized brush strokes with some
B_H9kYBBves,231519,234080,hatching and that is car in my own style
B_H9kYBBves,234080,235519,now for the hard part we're gonna try
B_H9kYBBves,235519,237840,realism anime and disney styles so for
B_H9kYBBves,237840,239439,realism what we're trying to do is we're
B_H9kYBBves,239439,241519,trying to capture something as lifelike
B_H9kYBBves,241519,243360,as possible so the colors are going to
B_H9kYBBves,243360,245040,be a bit more muted like you see in
B_H9kYBBves,245040,247120,everyday life and notice how my shadows
B_H9kYBBves,247120,249040,here are really vibrant while in a
B_H9kYBBves,249040,250959,realistic drawing you generally want to
B_H9kYBBves,250959,252720,be a little bit more gray and we're
B_H9kYBBves,252720,254319,actually going to be using this blending
B_H9kYBBves,254319,256720,tool a lot to get that soft texture of
B_H9kYBBves,256720,258079,the skin all right so look at that eye
B_H9kYBBves,258079,259359,socket it's starting to look really
B_H9kYBBves,259359,260880,three-dimensional having a realistic
B_H9kYBBves,260880,263040,style means you stay really grounded to
B_H9kYBBves,263040,264880,uh what you actually see in real life
B_H9kYBBves,264880,266560,and a lot of times the colors that you
B_H9kYBBves,266560,268960,see in real life are not actually that
B_H9kYBBves,268960,270479,vibrant now this probably doesn't look
B_H9kYBBves,270479,271840,too hard for me right now and that is
B_H9kYBBves,271840,273680,because i had a lot of time you know
B_H9kYBBves,273680,275759,drawing and painting in realistic styles
B_H9kYBBves,275759,277199,before i decided to actually try to
B_H9kYBBves,277199,278720,style as my work i always think it's
B_H9kYBBves,278720,280080,good to have a solid foundation in
B_H9kYBBves,280080,282479,realism because then you know the rules
B_H9kYBBves,282479,284240,before you actually break them so very
B_H9kYBBves,284240,286400,soft shading here and you know i usually
B_H9kYBBves,286400,288320,don't like to work at this pace it's
B_H9kYBBves,288320,291040,honestly just a lot of detail a lot of
B_H9kYBBves,291040,293120,refinement a lot of blending let's get
B_H9kYBBves,293120,294560,that shadow on the side of the face and
B_H9kYBBves,294560,296240,normally i'd leave this as a hard edge
B_H9kYBBves,296240,298240,but for realistic styles we're gonna
B_H9kYBBves,298240,299360,have to blend it maybe a bit of a
B_H9kYBBves,299360,301360,highlight on the forehead just like that
B_H9kYBBves,301360,303039,okay now we're gonna go into the eye and
B_H9kYBBves,303039,305039,we're gonna do even more detail we're
B_H9kYBBves,305039,306880,gonna add a bit of a highlight on the
B_H9kYBBves,306880,308800,upper lid of the eye we're gonna add a
B_H9kYBBves,308800,311280,highlight on the bottom lid as well i
B_H9kYBBves,311280,313039,learned this right here from
B_H9kYBBves,313039,315520,our friend whoop you guys know
B_H9kYBBves,315520,316960,he's pretty good if you go in the mirror
B_H9kYBBves,316960,318080,and look at yourself in the eye right
B_H9kYBBves,318080,319759,now really really closely you're going
B_H9kYBBves,319759,321039,to see that there's a bit of a almost
B_H9kYBBves,321039,323360,flower like pattern that radiates out
B_H9kYBBves,323360,325440,from the pupil of your eye and it's very
B_H9kYBBves,325440,326560,beautiful all right so that's pretty
B_H9kYBBves,326560,327520,good now we're going to take a light
B_H9kYBBves,327520,329759,color and we're just going to
B_H9kYBBves,329759,331600,get some highlights in there and now for
B_H9kYBBves,331600,333360,the hair okay let's give her some
B_H9kYBBves,333360,334560,shading
B_H9kYBBves,334560,337440,some soft blended shading so this is
B_H9kYBBves,337440,339360,okay this is not like fully realistic
B_H9kYBBves,339360,340880,because if you want to actually do that
B_H9kYBBves,340880,342000,you're gonna have to draw a lot of
B_H9kYBBves,342000,344560,individual strands and i really
B_H9kYBBves,344560,346000,i really don't want to do that guys so
B_H9kYBBves,346000,348000,there is our take on cara in a realistic
B_H9kYBBves,348000,349759,style it's not full realism but i think
B_H9kYBBves,349759,351600,it gets close enough all right now we're
B_H9kYBBves,351600,352880,going to get on to the real fun part
B_H9kYBBves,352880,354639,we're going to try anime and disney
B_H9kYBBves,354639,356080,styles now i've got a reference on the
B_H9kYBBves,356080,358000,screen here so you guys can see what i'm
B_H9kYBBves,358000,359840,trying to emulate the skin tone is not
B_H9kYBBves,359840,361120,going to be super vibrant because
B_H9kYBBves,361120,363039,generally uh for normal skin tones in
B_H9kYBBves,363039,365120,anime it's not really like super out
B_H9kYBBves,365120,366800,there so we're gonna stick to something
B_H9kYBBves,366800,368240,a little bit more believable what you're
B_H9kYBBves,368240,370080,gonna really notice with anime is
B_H9kYBBves,370080,372000,there's a lot of cell shading which
B_H9kYBBves,372000,373680,means there's a dark tone and a light
B_H9kYBBves,373680,374960,tone to convey the lighting in the
B_H9kYBBves,374960,377360,scenario and there's no blending or
B_H9kYBBves,377360,379120,detailed rendering at all it's very
B_H9kYBBves,379120,381199,sharp very shape based and there is a
B_H9kYBBves,381199,383600,heavy reliance on line art you can see
B_H9kYBBves,383600,385199,there's a lot of these big sharp shapes
B_H9kYBBves,385199,387520,which we're gonna try to copy so there
B_H9kYBBves,387520,389440,we go there's the two main colors for
B_H9kYBBves,389440,391440,the skin and the hair now what we're
B_H9kYBBves,391440,393199,gonna do is we're gonna pick a slightly
B_H9kYBBves,393199,395759,darker color and add some shadows onto
B_H9kYBBves,395759,397520,the face of the character and you can
B_H9kYBBves,397520,399199,see these shadow shapes are all going to
B_H9kYBBves,399199,401360,be very very simplified a lot of times
B_H9kYBBves,401360,402639,what you're going to find is shadows are
B_H9kYBBves,402639,404160,very muted there's not a lot of
B_H9kYBBves,404160,406319,saturation so as to not take away from
B_H9kYBBves,406319,408000,the clarity of the line art and the
B_H9kYBBves,408000,409759,readability of the character let's give
B_H9kYBBves,409759,411599,the hair some big triangular shapes in
B_H9kYBBves,411599,413039,the rendering that you're going to see
B_H9kYBBves,413039,414639,for anime a lot of times there's going
B_H9kYBBves,414639,417199,to be really strong geometric shapes
B_H9kYBBves,417199,418560,even in our reference you can see that
B_H9kYBBves,418560,420080,the hair is comprised of a bunch of
B_H9kYBBves,420080,422479,triangles and not necessarily lines or
B_H9kYBBves,422479,424479,blended brush strokes i personally love
B_H9kYBBves,424479,426240,the stylization and simplification of
B_H9kYBBves,426240,428080,anime if someone ever tries to tell you
B_H9kYBBves,428080,430000,that anime is an art
B_H9kYBBves,430000,431199,you
B_H9kYBBves,431199,432319,they probably don't know what they're
B_H9kYBBves,432319,433840,talking about okay now if we zoom in on
B_H9kYBBves,433840,435199,the reference you're gonna see that in
B_H9kYBBves,435199,438000,anime there's a heavy focus on line art
B_H9kYBBves,438000,439360,and i personally don't really like to do
B_H9kYBBves,439360,440800,line art but we're gonna give it a shot
B_H9kYBBves,440800,442319,here you guys see i'm not used to doing
B_H9kYBBves,442319,444720,this so i'm hitting the undo button a
B_H9kYBBves,444720,446560,lot a lot more than i would like but
B_H9kYBBves,446560,447919,honestly guys if you're the type of
B_H9kYBBves,447919,449680,person who uses this kind of line art in
B_H9kYBBves,449680,450880,your work
B_H9kYBBves,450880,453440,i uh respect you and applaud you for
B_H9kYBBves,453440,455280,your patience really the main goal of
B_H9kYBBves,455280,456960,this line art is to provide as much
B_H9kYBBves,456960,459520,clarity as possible and i am doing a
B_H9kYBBves,459520,461599,really bad job at this some sharp line
B_H9kYBBves,461599,463599,art for the mouth oh yeah oh yeah that
B_H9kYBBves,463599,465599,looks good okay let's outline the
B_H9kYBBves,465599,467759,outside silhouette
B_H9kYBBves,467759,469199,oh my god
B_H9kYBBves,469199,471120,please
B_H9kYBBves,471120,473759,please please please okay you know what
B_H9kYBBves,473759,474879,i think that looks really good it's kind
B_H9kYBBves,474879,477199,of very uh defined and graphic style
B_H9kYBBves,477199,478879,like you would find in anime characters
B_H9kYBBves,478879,480479,and i think if we were to continue this
B_H9kYBBves,480479,482560,style for the rest of her face she would
B_H9kYBBves,482560,484319,be a pretty convincing looking anime
B_H9kYBBves,484319,486080,character so so i guess we did it
B_H9kYBBves,486080,487280,alright
B_H9kYBBves,487280,489199,alright so we got three down one left to
B_H9kYBBves,489199,491120,go and the final one is gonna be a
B_H9kYBBves,491120,493199,disney animation style so immediately
B_H9kYBBves,493199,494879,one thing i've noticed is that uh
B_H9kYBBves,494879,498319,ariel's skin is much more of a warm tone
B_H9kYBBves,498319,499759,and there's a decent amount of
B_H9kYBBves,499759,501840,saturation more so than the realistic
B_H9kYBBves,501840,503280,style now you're also going to notice
B_H9kYBBves,503280,505840,that there is absolutely zero shading on
B_H9kYBBves,505840,507280,ariel so it's gonna be really simple a
B_H9kYBBves,507280,509120,lot of these older disney animations
B_H9kYBBves,509120,511039,relied very heavily on line art to
B_H9kYBBves,511039,512640,define the way these characters look
B_H9kYBBves,512640,514159,which is obviously understandable
B_H9kYBBves,514159,515760,because if you're hand drawing all these
B_H9kYBBves,515760,517360,animated frames you don't want to slow
B_H9kYBBves,517360,519440,yourself down too much by getting caught
B_H9kYBBves,519440,520800,up on the rendering of the character you
B_H9kYBBves,520800,522479,can see i'm keeping the silhouette of
B_H9kYBBves,522479,524320,the hair really round and organic and
B_H9kYBBves,524320,526160,that is because in our reference we have
B_H9kYBBves,526160,528399,a lot of curved lines that really just
B_H9kYBBves,528399,529920,flow into each other it's pretty
B_H9kYBBves,529920,531360,different from the anime style which
B_H9kYBBves,531360,533360,uses a lot more geometric shapes and i
B_H9kYBBves,533360,535519,think in my everyday drawing i also tend
B_H9kYBBves,535519,537760,to use a lot more geometric shapes than
B_H9kYBBves,537760,539519,these curved lines so it's going to be a
B_H9kYBBves,539519,540800,bit of challenge for me now because
B_H9kYBBves,540800,542560,there is no shading whatsoever we can
B_H9kYBBves,542560,544160,just get right into some of the small
B_H9kYBBves,544160,546480,details like her necklace as well as the
B_H9kYBBves,546480,548320,lineart there we go and now for the most
B_H9kYBBves,548320,550000,important part the line art which is
B_H9kYBBves,550000,552000,going to really define the shapes of
B_H9kYBBves,552000,553600,your character and i'm not really
B_H9kYBBves,553600,555839,getting off to a very good start here so
B_H9kYBBves,555839,557200,i mean throughout this process you can
B_H9kYBBves,557200,558880,probably tell that i don't do too much
B_H9kYBBves,558880,560880,line art because i'm obviously not super
B_H9kYBBves,560880,562320,comfortable with this i'm actually doing
B_H9kYBBves,562320,563839,a lot of scratchy lines which i would
B_H9kYBBves,563839,566240,like to avoid obviously this is this is
B_H9kYBBves,566240,567360,oh boy
B_H9kYBBves,567360,569360,i mean it looks simple
B_H9kYBBves,569360,570959,but it's hard
B_H9kYBBves,570959,572480,it's pretty hard okay let's get the
B_H9kYBBves,572480,575680,silhouette for her neck again very soft
B_H9kYBBves,575680,578160,and curved lines if you look at her face
B_H9kYBBves,578160,579839,there's no shading whatsoever so
B_H9kYBBves,579839,581600,everything is conveyed through line art
B_H9kYBBves,581600,582720,and there's a bit of coloring on the
B_H9kYBBves,582720,585440,lips so we're gonna add this in
B_H9kYBBves,585440,588000,as well get that line art at the opening
B_H9kYBBves,588000,589360,of the mouth
B_H9kYBBves,589360,591279,just like that and now let's zoom out a
B_H9kYBBves,591279,593440,bit and let's go into the hair so it's
B_H9kYBBves,593440,595040,going to be the same logic as before
B_H9kYBBves,595040,596480,you're going to use your line art to
B_H9kYBBves,596480,598800,define these shapes and i'm doing a lot
B_H9kYBBves,598800,600480,of scratchy lines because i'm not super
B_H9kYBBves,600480,602160,comfortable with this but you know what
B_H9kYBBves,602160,603519,as long as the final result turns out
B_H9kYBBves,603519,605519,okay there we go now let's add some
B_H9kYBBves,605519,607200,curved lines to the hair just to give it
B_H9kYBBves,607200,609120,a bit more definition now this is a very
B_H9kYBBves,609120,611040,simple looking style but it's definitely
B_H9kYBBves,611040,612720,not easy to do and there we go there is
B_H9kYBBves,612720,614320,our fourth and final quarter of this
B_H9kYBBves,614320,615839,painting in a disney style if you're
B_H9kYBBves,615839,617360,having trouble stylizing your character
B_H9kYBBves,617360,619120,i highly recommend you try out all these
B_H9kYBBves,619120,620720,different styles that other artists have
B_H9kYBBves,620720,622079,laid out before i think for me
B_H9kYBBves,622079,623600,personally this challenge is a great way
B_H9kYBBves,623600,625360,to try to spot all the differences
B_H9kYBBves,625360,626880,between different art styles the way
B_H9kYBBves,626880,628560,other artists like to simplify and all
B_H9kYBBves,628560,630320,these minute differences in terms of
B_H9kYBBves,630320,632240,line art and rendering so i hope you
B_H9kYBBves,632240,633680,guys enjoy this challenge go try it out
B_H9kYBBves,633680,635120,for yourself see if there's a style that
B_H9kYBBves,635120,636800,you really gravitate towards i thought
B_H9kYBBves,636800,638399,this would be a pretty fitting topic for
B_H9kYBBves,638399,640160,this video because this month on patreon
B_H9kYBBves,640160,642160,we're doing actually a stylization
B_H9kYBBves,642160,644240,tutorial so since nobody else is feeding
B_H9kYBBves,644240,645760,my village in this video go check that
B_H9kYBBves,645760,647600,out if you want to show some support and
