LlOg0mUoi9Q,1055,2170,"- Hi Vogue, I'm Camille Rowe"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,2170,4293,and this is what I wear in a week.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,5318,7901,[upbeat music]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,10813,12219,[calm music]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,12220,16780,"This is my sort of everyday, off duty look."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,16780,21780,"These are Celine loafers, 501 Levis, Petit Bateau t-shirt,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,23500,26003,and a Bodhi shirt.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,26893,28573,"I love this one, Hawaii."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,29572,33070,"My boyfriend grew up in Hawaii, so he loves it too."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,33070,35120,I'm a big denim lady.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,35120,38969,I like jeans to fit quite tight on the top.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,38970,41350,I like a little bit of a struggle for the button.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,41350,43440,I feel like it makes your butt look really good
LlOg0mUoi9Q,43440,45940,"when they're a bit tighter, but I do like it"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,45940,48430,to be a little looser on the leg.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,48430,50823,501s are always my kind of go-to.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,53160,57760,"You have to, you need to squat in the jeans a few times"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,57760,59570,after the wash.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,59570,61343,"Sorry, I'm very unladylike."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,62360,64443,[laughs]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,65293,67130,"When I first moved to New York when I was 21,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,67130,70990,"I was kind of shocked by, you know, people wearing"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,70990,75990,"like running trainers, sneakers, like out on the street."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,76110,77540,Like I would never be caught dead
LlOg0mUoi9Q,77540,81220,in even like a sweat pant or a sneaker.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,81220,83973,"Not in Paris, even when you're dressed down,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,84957,86813,you're sort of dressed up.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,86813,90030,This is my favorite everyday bag.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,90030,91740,You can fit everything here.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,91740,94183,"I got this one in in Depot Vent in Paris,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,95059,96369,like a second hand consignment store.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,96370,98315,"I don't know, I like it."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,98315,102640,"It's sort of an uncommon purse, like a bucket Kelly, maybe."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,102640,104750,"I don't really see these ones too much around,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,104750,109683,"so it's a little understated, you know, it's not too loud."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,119850,121659,This is my dinner party look.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,121660,124890,"During these strange, strange times,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,124890,127900,"two other couples, friends of ours, we decided to"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,127900,131660,throw dinner parties every week that were themed.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,131660,134120,"It's like a good excuse to throw on some heels,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,134120,135319,maybe a little makeup.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,135320,139660,"One of the themes was Italian Riviera evening,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,139660,141323,so this is what I wore.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,142216,146093,"This is my favorite restaurant, Positano de Adolpho."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,147261,149811,"I love merch, so I had to beg them to me a t-shirt,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,150774,152216,but it's so good.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,152216,156243,"This is a Kate jacket, Mansur Gavriel linen pants,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,157192,159600,and Celine loafers.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,159600,164113,I wore it with this little head scarf.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,166270,170643,These ones are vintage Dior sunglasses from the seventies.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,172605,177605,"I love an oversize glasses, an oversize glasses?"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,177810,181270,"That's, sorry, I'm English second language here."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,182883,183885,I feel glamorous.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,183885,186834,I feel like I could eat kilos and kilos and kilos of pasta.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,187688,189160,"Actually, this is not the best pasta look"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,189160,193960,"because you know I'm staining this, but I felt great."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,193960,196860,And then we had a Bond night.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,197724,201040,I rewatched all of the Bond films during lockdown
LlOg0mUoi9Q,201040,206040,and I wore this vintage nineties Gucci Tom Ford dress.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,209430,212920,"Channeling more of like the old-school Bond girl,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,212920,215533,love Ursula Andress.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,216710,219763,"I love dressing up, it's so much fun."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,219763,221163,"Go big or go home, you know?"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,222488,225138,I feel lucky that my friends are all into it as well.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,230109,232609,[jazzy music]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,235249,237222,This is my date night look.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,238120,243120,I love vintage like 1930s
LlOg0mUoi9Q,243940,247667,or any kind of sort of slip dress.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,247667,250053,"This one is vintage Valentino, but yeah,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,250926,252450,a little nightgown moment.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,252451,255686,"So if I'm at home, maybe just this cute little shoes,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,255686,257107,[speaks foreign language]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,257107,258707,"if I'm going to wear it out,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,258707,263267,then I really liked this Dior leather jacket.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,267608,268806,Do we like it with this jacket?
LlOg0mUoi9Q,268806,270305,Yeah.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,270305,272090,I love shopping vintage because you get to find
LlOg0mUoi9Q,272090,276029,really special pieces that no one else is wearing.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,276029,277060,If you check out the kind of like
LlOg0mUoi9Q,277060,280230,"shaker old lady neighborhoods, so you can always find"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,280230,281850,really good secondhand stores.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,281850,283593,I feel like that's a good secret.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,284670,289670,"I would probably pair it with this Row purse, right?"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,290530,291363,This is cute.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,292445,293743,"Okay, it's little."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,294851,296651,It doesn't really look like a purse.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,299247,300243,It's also a hat.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,300243,302326,[laughs]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,309260,314260,"This is my favorite go-to jacket, it's from the Row."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,314680,319490,I feel like it just makes everything look so much chicer.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,319490,323410,I'm wearing Nike sneakers.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,323411,324960,These are Acne jeans.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,324960,327979,This one is just a vintage white t-shirt
LlOg0mUoi9Q,327980,331000,and a little Prada vest.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,331000,333853,I've been very into little vests and t-shirts.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,337236,338973,I do my groceries in it.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,340242,341830,"See how I never use my phone for anything,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,341830,343612,and I just write down lists?
LlOg0mUoi9Q,344830,348103,"Bheese, banh mi, flour, eggs"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,348104,351230,"heavy cream, Perier, probiotics, green tea."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,351230,353943,"I wrote cheese twice, cheese, and cheese."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,356104,360264,I saw this jacket in the store and you know
LlOg0mUoi9Q,360264,362264,"when you just really, really fall in love"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,362264,364803,"with an item of clothing, that's what happened to me."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,364803,366159,"It's not my boyfriend's favorite coat,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,366159,369203,but I'm not dressing for him.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,370120,372020,So it can really go from day to night.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,373200,376543,These boots are Prada.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,383501,384493,"Yeah, they're not easy to open."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,386023,386856,Okay.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,389341,390174,Day to night.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,400525,405525,"This is my sort of seventies, revival style moment."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,406904,408319,"I love this cape, it's vintage."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,408320,413144,These are Kate little cashmere shorts.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,413144,414660,And this is a pretty long sleeve t-shirt
LlOg0mUoi9Q,414660,417100,and these are old Celine boots.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,417100,421430,"I have watched ""Almost Famous"" every year for my birthday"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,421430,425949,"since it came out, I would have been like 10 or something."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,425950,429070,"I love that film, so this is kind of"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,429070,431303,my homage to Penny Lane.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,432184,433017,"I'll go out dancing in this,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,433017,436743,"I'll go to a dinner, like a boozy dinner in this outfit,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,437885,440802,but I am [laughs].
LlOg0mUoi9Q,442840,445747,"It has that like, sort of [speaks foreign language]"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,445747,447421,that song with [speaks foreign language]
LlOg0mUoi9Q,447421,448254,where she's like the superhero.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,449461,450961,She does like stuff like this.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,451848,454563,"I think there's something very like sixties,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,454563,458440,like late sixties French lady about this too.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,458440,462780,I feel like everything's sort of like California French.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,462780,465180,"In a weird way, there are a lot of similarities."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,474730,478480,"This is my plane to dinner look,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,478480,481333,or car ride to dinner look.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,482168,487168,"It's a custom Gucci suit, pajama set I guess."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,487770,491210,"It's really comfortable, it's really loud."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,491210,492863,It's very like jingle bells-y.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,494123,496099,It I've also worn it the past three Christmases.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,496100,498670,"If I'm traveling, I like it with Converse."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,498670,503670,And then I would put on these little Prada guys.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,508650,509483,This is cute.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,511341,512599,I love a set.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,512599,514024,You don't have to think about it too much.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,514024,515349,"You can also tie it up the waist,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,515349,518229,that makes it maybe a little bit more put together.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,518229,520052,"It's special, I love it."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,529460,534460,This is my French girl style moment.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,534660,538470,I love a suit for every occasion.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,538470,541329,I've always loved three piece suits.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,541330,545523,The sort of like masculine feminine moment.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,545523,547140,"It feels very French, sort of like"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,547140,550683,the Yves Saint Laurent women of the seventies.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,552264,555928,"This suit is Acne, it's one of my favorite students."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,555928,557266,"I've had it for a minute,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,557266,559043,and I kind of love the cut of the pants.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,559043,561030,"And then I, I wanted it to be a three piece,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,561030,563503,so I found this vintage vest.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,565444,567944,"So you can make your own, these are the Row boots."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,568881,571165,I like that they're a bit long and pointy
LlOg0mUoi9Q,571165,572613,and then they just pop out of the pant.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,576787,577670,The accessory I'm going to wear with this
LlOg0mUoi9Q,577670,579583,this just red lipstick.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,581384,582990,I think it's like maybe 'cause like French ladies
LlOg0mUoi9Q,582990,584930,don't really put on a lot of makeup
LlOg0mUoi9Q,584930,586390,and then it's all about the lip
LlOg0mUoi9Q,586390,589280,or wearing something sort of masculine
LlOg0mUoi9Q,589280,591533,and like the lip makes it feel more feminine.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,592723,595380,It has been a very French thing I think for forever.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,595380,598323,"Not entirely sure why, but I feel French."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,599560,600393,Tres Francaise.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,601620,603304,"I don't know, I feel really good in this outfit."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,603304,606960,"I feel, I feel smart in an English sense"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,606960,609573,"not in American sense, although I do feel smart too."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,611224,613500,I think French women specifically more than anyone else
LlOg0mUoi9Q,613500,616910,"sort of focus more on like investment, like staple pieces"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,616910,620069,as opposed to like fast fashion.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,620070,623940,"You know, it's about good quality things"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,623940,625600,that you're going to wear forever.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,625600,628240,There is something about French women.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,628240,630083,They do really dress well.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,633280,636260,"Merci, Vogue, thank you so much for watching."
LlOg0mUoi9Q,636260,638583,"This is what I wear in a week,"
LlOg0mUoi9Q,638583,641253,and I will see you next time.
LlOg0mUoi9Q,642664,645081,[calm music]
