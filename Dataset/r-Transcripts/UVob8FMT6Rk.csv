UVob8FMT6Rk,80,5120,goal here  oh no this is just the beginning we've  been waiting to open the door for 50
UVob8FMT6Rk,5120,10800,years now that the door is open we go to  every state and uh and the congress and
UVob8FMT6Rk,10800,17600,the territories and make sure that we're  doing all we can to be as ambitious for  women and unborn children in the law and
UVob8FMT6Rk,17600,22720,that we're serving them at every step  along the way as we have noted this  decision was telegraphed a few months
UVob8FMT6Rk,22720,28880,ago that draft leaked  opinion when you saw that did you  anticipate that that would be what we
UVob8FMT6Rk,28880,35200,would see today or were you concerned  that that something may change along the  way  well we were certainly hoping that it
UVob8FMT6Rk,35200,40800,was we thought that it was probably  leaked so that it would put pressure on  roberts that there would be a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,40800,46800,violence and civil unrest based on the  leak that it would put pressure on the  court to do something different
UVob8FMT6Rk,46800,51840,um so that was certainly a concern but i  think it probably it had a had a the
UVob8FMT6Rk,51840,58079,opposite reaction which is perhaps  perhaps just cement some of those  decisions but basically those decisions
UVob8FMT6Rk,58079,64799,were made in terms of the text and  history of the constitution not on what  is happening at the in front of
UVob8FMT6Rk,64799,69840,justice's homes or the fire bombing of  pregnancy care centers that did not work
UVob8FMT6Rk,69840,76640,and that is a vote yes for democracy  and uh and i think that we will see this  as a as something really important as we
UVob8FMT6Rk,76640,82320,move ahead in trying to depolarize this  world abortion abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,82320,88720,supporters will now likely look to  congress what do you anticipate could  happen there
UVob8FMT6Rk,88720,95759,well what i see first and what i've been  working on with our allies in the  movement  for many months is movement in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,95759,100960,states right away there will be pre-road  bans on the books say it 15 weeks 20
UVob8FMT6Rk,100960,109280,weeks  from conception  and trigger laws that will allow laws to  go into effect in about 16 states or so
UVob8FMT6Rk,109280,115119,and then there'll be  battlegrounds where there's great hope  and possibility for unborn children and
UVob8FMT6Rk,115119,120560,their moms in a and in other states um  the the reality on the federal level is
UVob8FMT6Rk,120560,126799,that we have a lot of work to do  over the last several of election cycles  we've had votes on the 20 week paying
UVob8FMT6Rk,126799,132000,capable bill in the senate and it's  barely gotten a majority and it  certainly hasn't gotten a
UVob8FMT6Rk,132000,137760,filibuster-proof majority so we have a  lot of work to do there and it will  certainly be in the center of midterms
UVob8FMT6Rk,137760,143599,and in a way that will advantage our  pro-life candidates all over the country  especially u.s senators and governors
UVob8FMT6Rk,143599,149520,and house members looking to take over  the house and the senate marjorie dannon  felser thank you for your time and being
UVob8FMT6Rk,149520,155519,with us joining us now is nbc news  political director and meet the press  moderator chuck todd chuck we heard part
UVob8FMT6Rk,155519,162640,of the conversation there about what may  happen uh  in congress  characterize this day what it means and
UVob8FMT6Rk,162640,167680,and  what happens next  well i mean it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,167680,173040,we are already in a very polarized  political climate we are in a network
UVob8FMT6Rk,173040,178800,we've been in the middle of a massive  social disruption thanks to the pandemic
UVob8FMT6Rk,178800,185680,this is not going to sort of calm the  waters we are we are a divided country  this is going to divide us more
UVob8FMT6Rk,185680,192879,i think this is going to  you know if it's possible to supercharge  polarization in this country
UVob8FMT6Rk,192879,198720,this will do that  i think you will see  this sort of animate
UVob8FMT6Rk,198720,203760,uh the the the left in ways we've not  seen them animated before when it came
UVob8FMT6Rk,203760,209200,to the judiciary in the supreme court  you know this has been one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,209680,216000,concrete ways that republicans have been  able to get out the vote and fire up  their base over the years is is this
UVob8FMT6Rk,216000,221200,moment this goal  they got it  so now the question i'm watching here is
UVob8FMT6Rk,221200,226480,does this flip the debate  right for years you know when it was  became legal
UVob8FMT6Rk,226480,232319,the entire conversation became about  okay what are the limits  and now that
UVob8FMT6Rk,232319,238799,essentially the  the the supreme court is saying  uh you can make it illegal the question
UVob8FMT6Rk,238799,244000,question's going to be what else is next  you asked the head of the susan b
UVob8FMT6Rk,244000,249120,anthony the pro the pro-life  organization  what was next she was focused more on
UVob8FMT6Rk,249120,254480,states she talked about passing a  federal law of  20 weeks she didn't bring up
UVob8FMT6Rk,254480,260639,contraception but i promise you those in  the left are going to be worried about  that concerned about that there are some
UVob8FMT6Rk,260639,266560,that have talked about the issue of  contraception you're going to hear a lot  more talk about the so-called abortion  pill
UVob8FMT6Rk,266560,273199,and and i think you're going to see a  lot of challenges on that um some trying  to make it illegal
UVob8FMT6Rk,273199,279600,um  the biden administration i think is  going to do its best to try to  uh find ways to
UVob8FMT6Rk,279600,285759,get access to that pill and make that  easier but i think that it is going to  certainly
UVob8FMT6Rk,285759,291600,supercharge  the midterm conversation in certain  places not in every state
UVob8FMT6Rk,291600,297759,so in a couple of states michigan and  wisconsin those are probably the two  states that i would say politically will
UVob8FMT6Rk,297759,303840,be ground zero for this debate because  both of those states have immediate bans  that are now going to be triggered
UVob8FMT6Rk,303840,310400,within the next couple of days so  who is governor who controls the  legislature
UVob8FMT6Rk,310400,316240,will be the uh will matter a lot on the  future of women's rights in those two  states all right chuck stay with me i
UVob8FMT6Rk,316240,322320,want to bring into the conversation nbc  news washington correspondent yamiche  alcindor yamiche talk about how this
UVob8FMT6Rk,322320,328479,could affect the midterms and and  change the the general political debate
UVob8FMT6Rk,328479,334720,well this is a sea change in abortion  access to women across this country for  generations
UVob8FMT6Rk,334720,340400,this really does bring abortion to the  center of the midterm election to the  center of the conversation there were
UVob8FMT6Rk,340400,345759,women who i've talked to on the ground  in places like louisiana and mississippi  who are now going to have to drive hours
UVob8FMT6Rk,345759,350880,and hours for abortion access those  women when i was talking to them they  were not focused on abortion they didn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,350880,356800,even realize that abortion rights were  possibly something that could be taken  away but now this focuses their minds on
UVob8FMT6Rk,356800,362880,that and focuses their minds on sort of  what the conservative movement has  accomplished um the naacp is out with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,362880,368880,statement calling this an egregious  decision we should note that one in four  women in this country by the age of 45
UVob8FMT6Rk,368880,375120,have had an abortion 60 percent of  americans and on the latest nbc news  poll say that they want abortion access
UVob8FMT6Rk,375120,381440,to be legal in this country in some form  that being said the conservative  majority of course has made it very
UVob8FMT6Rk,381440,388479,clear that this is going to be something  that they're going to be sticking by and  this decision is really seen as  devastating to so many women across this
UVob8FMT6Rk,388479,395199,country by from for people who are of  course advocates of abortion rights i  also sat down with shannon brewer who is
UVob8FMT6Rk,395199,400240,the director of the women's health  organization in mississippi that's the  clinic that is at the center of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,400240,405280,decision she told me that she believes  women's lives are going to be put at  risk now because they're going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,405280,410800,forced into unsafe abortions or they're  gonna be forced to have children um that  they do not want to have and that they
UVob8FMT6Rk,410800,416000,have not planned for she tells me that  she's gonna be moving this clinic again  this clinic at the center of this case
UVob8FMT6Rk,416000,423039,she's saying now that they're gonna have  to close their doors and that they would  be moving to new mexico that's gonna be  the case in louisiana and so many other
UVob8FMT6Rk,423039,429840,states that are part of this 26 states  that the goodmacher institute says are  going to either restrict abortion or
UVob8FMT6Rk,429840,435599,very much ban abortion here so what we  see here is a political movement um that
UVob8FMT6Rk,435599,442400,is celebrating and on the conservative  side a big win but on the rep on the  democratic side you see now this
UVob8FMT6Rk,442400,448160,coalescing of people who really this  might not have been their number one  agenda who are now focusing on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,448160,453440,issue and are going to be making the  case that conservatives have gone just  too far here i also want to know when we
UVob8FMT6Rk,453440,458720,talk about sort of who is impacted here  i can't state enough that shannon brewer
UVob8FMT6Rk,458720,464960,sitting in mississippi  told me that she is most concerned about  black women poor women women who simply
UVob8FMT6Rk,464960,471199,just do not have the means to get an  abortion and she told me that she  doesn't have any hope at all that
UVob8FMT6Rk,471199,477199,congress will be able to do anything  legislatively to to change this to fix  this to have abortion access in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,477199,482879,country again she believes that there  will not be abortion access in the way  that that we had before this decision in
UVob8FMT6Rk,482879,489120,her lifetime lester so she really  believes at this point that the only way  for abortion access to happen is for
UVob8FMT6Rk,489120,495680,women to get in cars and help other  women and men in some cases to help  women access this but that is of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,495680,500720,part of this political decision it's  that there aren't really that many  political options here democrats are
UVob8FMT6Rk,500720,506000,going to be trying to argue that they  need to get more power to try to do  something about roe but this 6-3
UVob8FMT6Rk,506000,511759,majority on the court they have the  final say on so many things including  abortion access in this country so the
UVob8FMT6Rk,511759,517440,politics of this are really uneven it's  unclear what the white house plan is  we've had lawmakers pushing the white
UVob8FMT6Rk,517440,524320,house to come out with a plan some sort  of executive action that could try to  protect abortion rights but the white  house simply does not exactly know how
UVob8FMT6Rk,524320,531360,to deal with this and cannot by  themselves with the stroke of a pen give  women back these rights that now have  been taken away okay yamiche i'll ask
UVob8FMT6Rk,531360,537360,you and chuck to stand by i want to  continue this conversation but let me go  back to maura barrett she's with that  crowd you've been watching on the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,537360,543360,side of the screen the folks who have  gathered outside the supreme court a lot  of passion and emotion there more tell
UVob8FMT6Rk,543360,548920,us what's being said and then  characterize it for us
UVob8FMT6Rk,549200,554959,when we spoke earlier i was on the side  where i watched people jumping up and  down in celebration of the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,554959,561600,people that were against the right to an  abortion now i moved over to the other  side where we have similar we're  similarly seeing tears but instead of
UVob8FMT6Rk,561600,567839,those tears of joy we're seeing tears of  anguish i want you to meet skye she's 19  years old and came in from virginia
UVob8FMT6Rk,567839,573519,today and when we met earlier she told  me that she feels like her country  doesn't love her can you tell me more
UVob8FMT6Rk,573519,579839,about what you're feeling right now and  if you have hope about lawmakers taking  action going forward after today
UVob8FMT6Rk,579839,586320,i feel betrayed and i feel lost i feel  like  i'm 19 years old i've had my first year
UVob8FMT6Rk,586320,593200,of college i should be  feeling excited and happy and especially  at this time with so much life ahead of
UVob8FMT6Rk,593200,599440,me i shouldn't be worried about my  rights being taken away from me  and it hurts that i have little hope
UVob8FMT6Rk,599440,605120,for the future and  right now i feel like i'm just clinging  to that hopefully
UVob8FMT6Rk,605120,611200,in the future we can have some progress  and not just be moving backwards i feel  like especially right now we're just
UVob8FMT6Rk,611200,616560,moving backwards and we need to be  moving forwards instead  thank you so much and so that is a lot
UVob8FMT6Rk,616560,622079,of the same message we've heard from  people here talking about that feeling  of moving backwards you might not be
UVob8FMT6Rk,622079,629440,able to see but just behind me there's  another group of women  who are standing with tape over their  mouth that reads second class citizen
UVob8FMT6Rk,629440,636560,and so that is what the sentiment that  we're seeing here from women and men uh  who are very very upset about the
UVob8FMT6Rk,636560,641839,decision here today lester all right  maura thank you very much let me go back  to chuck todd chuck if you're still with
UVob8FMT6Rk,641839,646880,us um you know the question of whether  roe v wade is was settled law was asked
UVob8FMT6Rk,646880,653040,that certainly in the confirmation  hearings for supreme  court justice nominees
UVob8FMT6Rk,653040,658160,we have been through the controversy  over  jenny thomas the wife of
UVob8FMT6Rk,658160,663440,justice thomas and apparent apparent  efforts to support overturning the
UVob8FMT6Rk,663440,670800,election what is all this collectively  due to how we perceive the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,670800,677440,oh i think the supreme court is this is  can um i think there are no more black  robes i think the robes are red and blue
UVob8FMT6Rk,677440,683120,uh i think that is you know this is the  we've been watching this happen  particularly in an aggressive way over
UVob8FMT6Rk,683120,689600,the last 15 years um it's been a concern  on the lower courts you've started to  see you know we lowered the threshold to
UVob8FMT6Rk,689600,695440,just 50 votes in the senate which  guaranteed you wouldn't get um
UVob8FMT6Rk,695440,702640,center left or center right it means you  were going to get something a little  more hardcore  it's been an aggressive uh obviously
UVob8FMT6Rk,702640,709200,political movement on the right in  particular on judges and if you look at  these back-to-back rulings on guns
UVob8FMT6Rk,709200,714720,and on abortion i think it really does  sort of  i think what's striking about roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,714720,720720,is it's the first time in my lifetime  that i can think of where a supreme  court took away a right
UVob8FMT6Rk,720720,728959,supreme court  i can't think of another court in the  last hundred years that has done this uh  right that was there taken away you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,728959,735360,we're used to the supreme court granting  rights same-sex marriage you know sort  of  in reinterpreting things this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,735360,742639,specific right being taken away  from slightly more than half the  population so i i just think it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,742639,747680,it's going  we don't fully know the consequences yet
UVob8FMT6Rk,747680,753040,that's why we love the phrase unintended  consequences and i think there's going  to be a lot of them short term medium
UVob8FMT6Rk,753040,759200,term and long term  but the trust in the court and the  erosion of that and making it
UVob8FMT6Rk,759200,764639,be viewed as an extraordinarily partisan  institution  you know we already
UVob8FMT6Rk,764639,771519,it we already have that in the house and  the senate  and i think now  particularly what happened this week
UVob8FMT6Rk,771519,777440,particularly how the how donald trump  appointed the supreme court  how he went about it particularly the
UVob8FMT6Rk,777440,784240,the you know in the whole scalia thing  with mcconnell and all that there really  is  a lot of people who believe this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,784240,790240,rigged court this wasn't this it wasn't  this court's makeup isn't quote fair and
UVob8FMT6Rk,790240,795600,square it isn't really representative of  where the country is and even was
UVob8FMT6Rk,795600,801920,and i think that is only going to add to  cynicism it's only going to add to that  and it is really look john roberts has
UVob8FMT6Rk,801920,807120,been concerned about this you know  he clearly attempted to create to try to
UVob8FMT6Rk,807120,812399,find a middle ground here and he failed  he was trying to redefine roe rather
UVob8FMT6Rk,812399,819199,than have it overturned because i think  he realized  that  it would it would really could roil the
UVob8FMT6Rk,819199,824320,country and it could really undermine  the court one other point i want to put  out here
UVob8FMT6Rk,824320,831519,um and just to and i'll just let it let  it sort of sit out there like a meatball  lester i don't think we can fully ever
UVob8FMT6Rk,831519,837440,appreciate the 2016 presidential  election is going to turn out to be  perhaps the most consequential election
UVob8FMT6Rk,837440,843120,in more than 100 years  the fallout from that election  right particularly you look at cortisone
UVob8FMT6Rk,843120,849519,we can go through a whole thing and i  i'm gonna do a lot of that on sunday um  but just think about
UVob8FMT6Rk,849519,854880,how all what has changed in america and  culture and society
UVob8FMT6Rk,854880,860240,due to the results of the 2016 election  i think many would not disagree with  that assessment we'll be interested in
UVob8FMT6Rk,860240,865279,hearing what more you have to say about  it this weekend on meet the press chuck  thanks let me go back to uh pete
UVob8FMT6Rk,865279,870959,williams um pete we're kind of left with  a checkerboard now of um of states and
UVob8FMT6Rk,870959,877519,and how they regard abortion rights  and then there's the issue of even  within some of those that plan to ban it
UVob8FMT6Rk,877519,883519,uh rape and incest where does that leave  us right now  well it leaves without any
UVob8FMT6Rk,883519,890240,constitutional protection for that  remember the mississippi law did not  have exceptions for uh for rape or
UVob8FMT6Rk,890240,896000,incest and that is the law that the  supreme court today has upheld  the majority opinion doesn't say
UVob8FMT6Rk,896000,902399,anything about that directly the  dissents say that  because of the decision there's no
UVob8FMT6Rk,902399,909279,longer any constitutional support for  the idea that there has to be some  exception to abortion laws for rape or
UVob8FMT6Rk,909279,916320,incest  justice brett kavanaugh in a footnote in  his uh a concurrence says that he thinks
UVob8FMT6Rk,916320,922800,the court leaves open an additional  question about whether there has to be  an exception for cases when an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,922800,928079,would save the life of the mother  but in terms of the in terms of rape or
UVob8FMT6Rk,928079,934320,incest there's no longer any  constitutional protection or requirement  that any of the states that are going to  ban abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,934320,941199,make an exception in those cases and the  dissent  decries that and let me just quote one  other sentence from the joint descent
UVob8FMT6Rk,941199,946959,written by stephen breyer  he says he concludes his dissent by  saying this with sorrow
UVob8FMT6Rk,946959,953360,for this court but more for the many  millions of american women who have  today lost a fundamental constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,953360,959199,protection we descend you know this is  one of those days lester that if we were  still in the days where the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,959199,965680,court was open to the public which it's  been closed since the the pandemic hit  you would see the majority opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,965680,972079,announced by justice alito and it tracks  so closely with the draft that was  leaked in may
UVob8FMT6Rk,972079,980079,the the majority calls the roe v wade  decision not only wrong but egregiously  wrong and explains why it overturns 50
UVob8FMT6Rk,980079,985600,years of precedent but you would also  have seen a long-spirited descent read
UVob8FMT6Rk,985600,991040,from the bench  we don't get to hear that because uh we  don't you know the justices don't take
UVob8FMT6Rk,991040,997360,to the bench now these decisions just  come out on the web but that's the sort  of dramatic division that these opinions
UVob8FMT6Rk,997360,1003519,represent here this is as as divided as  the supreme court can be uh pete let me  uh if i can bring up something i was
UVob8FMT6Rk,1003519,1011360,talking to chuck a moment ago about the  image of the court itself clearly  they're not playing for popularity but  you presume they want respect uh the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1011360,1018000,leak of the draft opinion i know it  shocked you and a lot of people the  questions over jenny thomas and her
UVob8FMT6Rk,1018000,1024160,efforts to overturn the election all  these things have taken  perhaps given a collective hit to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1024160,1029678,court how do you see the future of the  court going forward after this this  ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,1029678,1034959,well i mean this this is a supreme court  that is newly emboldened i mean what
UVob8FMT6Rk,1034959,1041199,what you i think you see here so vividly  represented in the decisions that we got  this week but most especially on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1041199,1046640,abortion the abortion decision is  years of sort of pent up frustration of
UVob8FMT6Rk,1046640,1051760,the conservatives that they couldn't get  a majority and i think that's why they
UVob8FMT6Rk,1051760,1057039,are not taking the go-slow approach that  the chief justice had advocated here
UVob8FMT6Rk,1057039,1062559,they've been waiting to do this for  years and now they have the votes to do  it and they're not going to be held back
UVob8FMT6Rk,1062559,1068559,so i think what does that mean for the  next term that probably means that the  affirmative action in college admissions
UVob8FMT6Rk,1068559,1074400,is dead uh the supreme these  conservatives have been uh opposed to  that for years they've been chipping
UVob8FMT6Rk,1074400,1080559,away at it there are two cases coming  before the court next year from harvard  and the university of north carolina
UVob8FMT6Rk,1080559,1086799,it seems pretty likely that affirmative  action will bite the dust next term so  it's it's it's the it's the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1086799,1092480,conservatives now have the votes and  they're going full throttle pete  williams uh we'll continue to chat along
UVob8FMT6Rk,1092480,1098400,the way here i want to go to actually  let me first let you know that we  understand that uh speaker nancy pelosi
UVob8FMT6Rk,1098400,1103919,is going to be coming before the cameras  to react here very shortly so we are  standing by for that but let me go to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1103919,1110640,nbc news chief white house correspondent  peter alexander is there uh official  early reaction coming from the white
UVob8FMT6Rk,1110640,1116400,house peter  yeah lester we haven't heard from the  white house just yet not from the  president but based on the conversations
UVob8FMT6Rk,1116400,1122480,i've been having privately over the  course of last several weeks and what  i'm seeing is i look down at the west  wing where white house staff right now
UVob8FMT6Rk,1122480,1128640,are removing chairs from the roosevelt  room it appears highly likely that we  will hear from president biden on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,1128640,1134240,issue at some point today the white  house the president they have been  bracing for this ruling for the course
UVob8FMT6Rk,1134240,1140160,of the last several weeks  top officials the president among them  have been meeting with lawmakers and
UVob8FMT6Rk,1140160,1146480,stakeholders abortion right advocates  among others and what we've yet to hear  from president biden we have now just
UVob8FMT6Rk,1146480,1152240,heard from his  from his democratic predecessor in the  white house barack obama who released a
UVob8FMT6Rk,1152240,1158320,statement that says today the supreme  court not only reversed nearly 50 years  of precedent it relegated the most
UVob8FMT6Rk,1158320,1165039,intensely personal decision someone can  make to the whims of politicians and  ideologues attacking the essential
UVob8FMT6Rk,1165039,1171440,freedoms of millions of americans chuck  schumer in a statement just called this  one of the darkest days that our country
UVob8FMT6Rk,1171440,1176880,has ever seen and while we're waiting to  hear from the house speaker nancy pelosi  in a matter of moments she did post a
UVob8FMT6Rk,1176880,1182000,statement moments ago and she puts the  blame directly on republicans she says
UVob8FMT6Rk,1182000,1188160,because of donald trump mitch mcconnell  the republican party and their super  majority on the supreme court american
UVob8FMT6Rk,1188160,1193360,women today have less freedom than their  mothers president biden what can he do
UVob8FMT6Rk,1193360,1199440,there has been a lot of pressure growing  calls particularly from abortion rights  advocates for him to take executive
UVob8FMT6Rk,1199440,1205840,actions to try to do whatever he can to  help protect and expand women's  reproductive rights specifically the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1205840,1212000,college has been asking him for the  ability to use federal lands to expand  reproductive
UVob8FMT6Rk,1212000,1218320,health care for women where possible and  separately to try to increase access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1218320,1225120,abortion medication abortion pills right  now a majority of abortions in this  country are done with the use of
UVob8FMT6Rk,1225120,1230240,abortion medication those pills so i  think that's going to be where you're  going to see a lot of the focus it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,1230240,1236720,unclear whether whether president biden  today will announce any new steps he's  willing to take how he's prepared to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1236720,1241919,react to this the white house did not  react preemptively to this ruling even
UVob8FMT6Rk,1241919,1248480,after  that  leak came out a matter of months ago but  again as we stand here at the white
UVob8FMT6Rk,1248480,1255200,house on what democrats are calling one  of the darkest days in this country's  history it does appear increasingly  clear that we will hear from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1255200,1260799,president at some point over the course  of this day last year all right keep us  posted peter thank you for that blaine
UVob8FMT6Rk,1260799,1266640,alexander is in jackson mississippi  where the state's only abortion clinic  is located the very same clinic that
UVob8FMT6Rk,1266640,1272799,went to court to challenge the  mississippi abortion ban at the heart of  today's decision and blaine it's not
UVob8FMT6Rk,1272799,1278159,lost on us we're looking at these  protests right now we're hearing from  you know leadership in washington but
UVob8FMT6Rk,1278159,1284320,but what this will impact is the people  in that community and communities like  it across the country tell us what the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1284320,1290559,reaction is there  you know lester this is truly a  polarizing case no matter where you look
UVob8FMT6Rk,1290559,1296159,but perhaps no more so than right here  in mississippi as you said this is the  case that launched this to the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,1296159,1301280,court and as i've spent time talking to  people on both sides of the issue here  in mississippi for people who have spent
UVob8FMT6Rk,1301280,1307280,years kind of in the anti-abortion space  who've been fighting for years to  essentially take down roe there's almost
UVob8FMT6Rk,1307280,1312320,this sense of pride that mississippi was  the case to in one woman's words
UVob8FMT6Rk,1312320,1317360,essentially bring down roe there's a  sense that it originated here in  mississippi that their state was the one
UVob8FMT6Rk,1317360,1323440,that played such a key role in this i've  been talking with some people some who  have spent almost 30 years essentially
UVob8FMT6Rk,1323440,1329280,advocating for the end of abortion and  their reactions are very striking tears  lots of tears that's what one person
UVob8FMT6Rk,1329280,1334640,texted me calling it surreal another  person saying they're just simply  thankful and others saying that this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,1334640,1340000,just the beginning now i want to  underscore the point we talk about kind  of the opinion across the country many
UVob8FMT6Rk,1340000,1345919,people across the country the majority  in fact of americans believe in a right  to abortion access to abortion that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,1345919,1351280,not the case here in mississippi in fact  recent polling shows that some 59  percent of people here in the state of
UVob8FMT6Rk,1351280,1357840,mississippi believe that abortion should  be illegal in most cases so what we're  seeing here while people
UVob8FMT6Rk,1357840,1364640,have told me they're not going to be out  in the streets celebrating they're not  going to be out necessarily holding  grand press conferences or or
UVob8FMT6Rk,1364640,1370960,celebrating publicly they say that this  is just the beginning but their focus  now is to kind of go out and give access
UVob8FMT6Rk,1370960,1376400,and resources to women who now are going  to have a different path forward okay  blaine thank you for that joining me on
UVob8FMT6Rk,1376400,1382320,the telephone now is u.s senator from  minnesota democrat amy klobuchar senator  thank you for being here i know this
UVob8FMT6Rk,1382320,1387520,ruling thank you definitely disappoints  you but  the logical next question is what are
UVob8FMT6Rk,1387520,1394080,you you being congress going to do about  it  well i think that's a good question to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1394080,1399200,ask our republican colleagues who  put these judges on the bench who are
UVob8FMT6Rk,1399200,1404240,working against the interests of the  american people we have 80 percent of
UVob8FMT6Rk,1404240,1409760,the people with us on this that want roe  v wade up held and we also
UVob8FMT6Rk,1409760,1416480,have women who are going to be affected  all over the country over 20 states  already have laws in place that could be
UVob8FMT6Rk,1416480,1423279,used to restrict access to an abortion  including 13  states which will automatically go into
UVob8FMT6Rk,1423279,1429039,effect literally they have said in this  decision that a woman shouldn't be  making her own decisions but that
UVob8FMT6Rk,1429039,1436240,instead politicians should be making  them so what's next lester well the big  thing that's next is the election
UVob8FMT6Rk,1436240,1443600,and women and the men that support them  are going to be going and drove to the  ballot box because this supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,1443600,1450240,isn't just taking us back to the 1950s  it's taking us back to the 1850s
UVob8FMT6Rk,1450240,1457440,do you think this has animated democrats  to the point this could be a decision  maker a turning point in some of these
UVob8FMT6Rk,1457440,1464880,races we're following  um  you know what i'm not going to make a  political analysis today because this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,1464880,1471200,literally fundamentally about a law that  has protected women for 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,1471200,1477919,but i think the answer is pretty obvious  that the public is with us that the  republicans have put these justices on
UVob8FMT6Rk,1477919,1483039,the supreme court that are so out of  touch with americans that they literally
UVob8FMT6Rk,1483039,1489440,have issued an opinion in which they  note that abortion the word abortion is  not in the constitution you know what
UVob8FMT6Rk,1489440,1494480,else isn't in the constitution lester  woman isn't in the constitution the word
UVob8FMT6Rk,1494480,1501520,she is not in the constitution  there are many things air force wasn't  in the constitution
UVob8FMT6Rk,1501520,1508640,that is the basis of their opinion and  they have literally turned back the  clock on 50 years of well-settled
UVob8FMT6Rk,1508640,1514799,precedent is is there anything that that  democrats can do in your opinion to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1514799,1520000,change this tide  there's a big thing we can do and that
UVob8FMT6Rk,1520000,1525679,is reaching out to independents to  moderate republicans in states across
UVob8FMT6Rk,1525679,1532080,the country and say enough is enough  join us so that we can get enough people
UVob8FMT6Rk,1532080,1537919,in the u.s senate for starters and in  the house that can basically codify roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,1537919,1544799,v wade into law that we can make very  clear that this protection will remain
UVob8FMT6Rk,1544799,1550480,and none of us can say we didn't see  this coming in may of course there was  that much talked about leak of the draft
UVob8FMT6Rk,1550480,1555520,opinion that is essentially mirrored  here in what we saw in this final ruling  today
UVob8FMT6Rk,1555520,1562320,that was many would argue that was if  there was no other warning shot that was  it uh did some of these mechanisms begin
UVob8FMT6Rk,1562320,1568559,then or are you starting from scratch  now  [Music]  um i think that a lot of people became
UVob8FMT6Rk,1568559,1573679,educated on what this mean for so long  young women assumed that this is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1573679,1580400,world they never thought that there  could be a world where their mothers and  their grandmas had more rights than they
UVob8FMT6Rk,1580400,1587120,did  and i think it's already as you can see  from  people already they've many of them have
UVob8FMT6Rk,1587120,1592559,read that opinion they've read reports  on the opinion they knew exactly what's  coming their way senator i hate to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1592559,1597760,interrupt but uh speaker pelosi is  speaking that we want to hear what she  has to say morning the radical supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,1597760,1603600,court is eviscerating americans rights  and endangering their health and safety
UVob8FMT6Rk,1603600,1609039,but the congress will continue to act  uh to overcome this extremism
UVob8FMT6Rk,1609039,1616000,extremism and protect the american  people  today the republican-controlled supreme  court has achieved their dark
UVob8FMT6Rk,1616000,1622960,extreme goal of ripping away a woman's  right to make
UVob8FMT6Rk,1622960,1629760,their own dis reproductive health  decisions because of donald trump mitch  mcconnell
UVob8FMT6Rk,1629760,1636159,and the republican party their super  majority in the supreme court  american women today have less freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,1636159,1641679,than their mothers  with  roe and their attempt to destroy it
UVob8FMT6Rk,1641679,1648880,radical republicans are charging ahead  with their crusade  to criminalize  health freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,1648880,1654399,in the congress  be aware of this the republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,1654399,1659840,are plotting a nationwide abortion ban  they cannot be allowed to have a
UVob8FMT6Rk,1659840,1665200,majority in the congress  to do that  but that's their goal
UVob8FMT6Rk,1665200,1672159,and if you read  and again we're all studying all this  but if you read what is in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1672159,1678159,very clear  one of the justices had his own
UVob8FMT6Rk,1678159,1685919,statement  it's about  contraception  in vitro fertilization
UVob8FMT6Rk,1686880,1696919,family planning  that is all what will spring  from their decision that they made today
UVob8FMT6Rk,1697039,1702480,such a contradiction  yesterday to say the states
UVob8FMT6Rk,1702480,1708000,cannot make laws governing  the constitutional right to bear arms
UVob8FMT6Rk,1708000,1715840,and  today they're saying the exact reverse  that the states can overturn
UVob8FMT6Rk,1715840,1723679,a constitutional right for 50 years a  constitutional right  for a woman having the right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,1723679,1728799,the hypocrisy is raging  but the harm
UVob8FMT6Rk,1728799,1731440,is endless
UVob8FMT6Rk,1734640,1740000,what this means to women is such an  insult it's a slap in the face to women
UVob8FMT6Rk,1740000,1746320,about using their own judgment  to make their own decisions
UVob8FMT6Rk,1746320,1751440,about their reproductive freedom  and again it goes well i always have
UVob8FMT6Rk,1751440,1758880,said the termination of a pregnancy is  just their opening act it's just their  front game but because but beyond
UVob8FMT6Rk,1758880,1764159,behind it and for years i have seen in  this congress opposition to any family
UVob8FMT6Rk,1764159,1770000,planning domestic or global  when we have had those discussions and
UVob8FMT6Rk,1770000,1777520,those debates and those votes on the  floor of the house  this is deadly serious
UVob8FMT6Rk,1777520,1784720,but we are not going to let this pass  a woman's right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,1784720,1792080,reproductive freedom  is on the ballot in november  we cannot allow them
UVob8FMT6Rk,1792080,1797360,to take charge so that they can  institute their goal
UVob8FMT6Rk,1797360,1803200,which is to criminalize  reproductive freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,1803200,1810960,to criminalize it  right now they're saying in states that  they can arrest doctors and all the rest
UVob8FMT6Rk,1810960,1816240,what is happening here  what is happening here a woman's  fundamental health decisions are her own
UVob8FMT6Rk,1816240,1821600,to make in consultation with her doctor  her faith her family
UVob8FMT6Rk,1821600,1827440,not some right-wing politicians  that donald trump and mitch mcconnell
UVob8FMT6Rk,1827440,1833760,pack the court with  while republicans seek to punish and  control women democrats will keep
UVob8FMT6Rk,1833760,1838799,fighting ferociously to enshrine  roe v wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,1838799,1844880,and the law of the land  this cruel ruling is outrageous and  heart-wrenching
UVob8FMT6Rk,1844880,1849960,but make no mistake  again
UVob8FMT6Rk,1850480,1857120,it's all on the ballot in november  the supreme court has ended a  constitutional right this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,1857120,1863840,50 years  proclaimed a constitutional right  what happened today was historic in many
UVob8FMT6Rk,1863840,1870080,respects  historic in that  it had  not granted
UVob8FMT6Rk,1870080,1876640,recognized a constitutional right and  then reversed it  this is a first
UVob8FMT6Rk,1876640,1883679,and again  just before it imposed a constitutional  right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,1883679,1889360,allow for concealed weapons  how about those justices coming before
UVob8FMT6Rk,1889360,1896240,the senators and saying that they  they respected  sorry decisions the president of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1896240,1903440,court  that they respected the right of privacy  in the constitution of the united states
UVob8FMT6Rk,1904080,1910880,did you hear that  were they not telling the truth then
UVob8FMT6Rk,1912559,1918880,again  [Applause]  just getting to the gun issue because
UVob8FMT6Rk,1918880,1924320,really in preparation for this morning  it was really an exalted state about
UVob8FMT6Rk,1924320,1930799,what happened in the united states  senate yesterday  counterpoint
UVob8FMT6Rk,1930799,1936640,to the dangerous decision of this  trumpian supreme court that they made
UVob8FMT6Rk,1936640,1943840,yesterday  but a way to take us to as the bill is  called community safety
UVob8FMT6Rk,1944080,1949120,the bipartisan safer communities act  right now and i'm going to have to leave
UVob8FMT6Rk,1949120,1955519,momentarily because we're just finished  voting on the rule  we will be debating the bill  on the floor
UVob8FMT6Rk,1955519,1961600,and we expect a good bipartisan vote on  it in the house we congratulate the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1961600,1967600,senate on the work that they have done  and the timeliness of it to be passed in
UVob8FMT6Rk,1967600,1977600,the senate in a strong bipartisan way on  a day  when the court  made such a dangerous dangerous decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,1977600,1983919,we will  many of our house democrats proposals  that are included in this package
UVob8FMT6Rk,1983919,1991120,are that keep deadly weapons out of  dangerous hands by encouraging states to  establish extreme risk protection order
UVob8FMT6Rk,1991120,1997519,laws  erpo otherwise known as red flag laws  help put into straw purchases close the
UVob8FMT6Rk,1997519,2001039,boyfriend loophole
UVob8FMT6Rk,2002720,2008799,so many good things are in there and  it's not everything that we wanted we  must keep moving toward background
UVob8FMT6Rk,2008799,2014799,checks but  universal background checks which will  save the most lives but this will save
UVob8FMT6Rk,2014799,2020399,lives  and to listen to lucy mcgrath and other  family members of those who have lost
UVob8FMT6Rk,2020399,2025519,their loved ones  this is a giant step forward
UVob8FMT6Rk,2025519,2031039,maybe not so much a giant but a strong  step forward and if it's good enough for
UVob8FMT6Rk,2031039,2036159,them  then we rejoice in passing it
UVob8FMT6Rk,2036159,2042399,as i say to members all the time with  legislation  do not judge it for what isn't in it
UVob8FMT6Rk,2042399,2049760,but respect it for what is  and there's much to be respected in this  legislation
UVob8FMT6Rk,2050240,2057839,on a happier note yesterday we  celebrated 50 years of title ix which  has transformed equality and opportunity
UVob8FMT6Rk,2057839,2063040,speaker pelosi  talking to gathered reporters at the  capitol reacting to the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,2063040,2068398,decision today  near the end you heard her celebrating  the expected passage of the gun safety
UVob8FMT6Rk,2068398,2073679,legislation bipartisan legislation but  she reserved some very strong words for
UVob8FMT6Rk,2073679,2080720,the supreme court decision to overturn  roe v wade  calling it a trumpian supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,2080720,2087760,she said this was they were essentially  had accomplished their dark and extreme  goal and she said women today have less
UVob8FMT6Rk,2087760,2094398,freedom than their mothers and vowing  that this will be an issue  in the midterm elections are hoping it
UVob8FMT6Rk,2094398,2101040,will be an issue in the midterm  elections joining us now is christian  day executive director of democrats for
UVob8FMT6Rk,2101040,2107920,life of america kristin thank you for  being with us uh can you give us your  reaction uh not only to the decision but
UVob8FMT6Rk,2107920,2113359,some of what speaker pelosi just said  we are just thrilled by the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,2113359,2119599,court overturning roe v wade it's long  past due  with respect to what the the speaker
UVob8FMT6Rk,2119599,2125599,says i know it's a very emotional issue  but she continually overlooks the fact
UVob8FMT6Rk,2125599,2132480,that  women support overturning rugby wade  democrats support  overturning roe v wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,2132480,2139359,not all democrats are celebrating this  not all democrats advocate for  borrow and maintaining um abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,2139359,2146160,now we have an opportunity here as a  party  bring people together on this issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,2146160,2152240,and look to see how we can support women  you know i hear a lot of talk about  shipping women off to other states to
UVob8FMT6Rk,2152240,2158400,get abortion  how about helping women where they are  how about  looking at
UVob8FMT6Rk,2158400,2164640,ways to help women stay in school ways  for women to keep their jobs and have  their babies and providing women with
UVob8FMT6Rk,2164640,2170800,real choice rather than abortion is the  only solution as we have done speaking  the speaker mentioned a criminalization
UVob8FMT6Rk,2170800,2177200,is that where you think this is going  and is that something you would support  absolutely not i signed a letter with
UVob8FMT6Rk,2177200,2183040,pro-life leaders saying we do not want  to criminalize women for seeking  abortion a woman who is in an unplanned
UVob8FMT6Rk,2183040,2190240,pregnancy and in that situation deserves  compassion love and support and not  criminalization so we i think the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2190240,2196560,pro-life women and men and women that i  work with are united on that front we  want to help pregnant women we want them
UVob8FMT6Rk,2196560,2203119,to have the opportunity to parents when  you look at statistics  uh you know it's poor women who uh who
UVob8FMT6Rk,2203119,2208800,are most likely to to seek abortion we  need to do better as a nation in  providing equity for those women and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2208800,2213839,allowing them the same opportunities to  parent  as we do of wealthy individuals would
UVob8FMT6Rk,2213839,2220720,you like more clarity what do you think  should happen in congress going forward  i think congress should stay back for a
UVob8FMT6Rk,2220720,2226800,little bit let the states work this out  each state's going to have their own  challenge for example california new
UVob8FMT6Rk,2226800,2231839,york and new jersey have the highest  abortion rates in the nation what are  they going to do to lower those rates
UVob8FMT6Rk,2231839,2238480,and provide women with real choice  you know states that are limiting  abortion to eight weeks or 15 weeks you
UVob8FMT6Rk,2238480,2244160,know what are they going to do to  support those women who no longer can  seek abortion in those states how are we  going to provide them with the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2244160,2250079,opportunity and the support to parents  feed their families keep their jobs and  um you know have affordable health uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,2250079,2255520,health care affordable child care  christians we have a nation so much  better than continuing this you know

UVob8FMT6Rk,2268000,2274560,and giving us your views we appreciate  it  thank you very much so it is a little  bit after 11 o'clock in the east let me
UVob8FMT6Rk,2274560,2282000,recap the extraordinary and historical  decision that came down just after 10  a.m eastern roe v wade a woman's right
UVob8FMT6Rk,2282000,2287680,to abortion has been overturned by the  supreme court after almost 50 years and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2287680,2294320,will lead to nearly total bans on the  procedure in about half the states the  majority conservative supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,2294320,2299599,overturned roe  in this morning's decision it's a  victory for opponents of abortion you
UVob8FMT6Rk,2299599,2306480,just heard from one supporters of  abortion rights were bracing for the  loss after an early draft of the opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,2306480,2312320,was leaked in may  and call it an assault and the  reproductive freedoms of women the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2312320,2317640,ruling came in despite in a dispute over  a law passed by mississippi's
UVob8FMT6Rk,2317640,2323359,republican-controlled legislature to ban  abortions after 15 weeks
UVob8FMT6Rk,2323359,2330400,joining us now is nbc news senior  washington correspondent hallie jackson  who's been monitoring reaction and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2330400,2336880,also trying to put the puzzle pieces  together because uh the rule of the land  is going to be very different in in
UVob8FMT6Rk,2336880,2343599,various places  it is an almost instantaneous change now  that this decision this anticipated
UVob8FMT6Rk,2343599,2349680,ruling has finally come down lester let  me give you a sense of what we're  hearing as far as political reaction  you've had a taste of it in our last
UVob8FMT6Rk,2349680,2355280,hour and 10 minutes or so of coverage  here on nbc news but we've heard now  from mike pence right former vice
UVob8FMT6Rk,2355280,2361839,president somebody who is speculated to  be a potential 2024 candidate too this  is obviously a decision that is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,2361839,2368079,reshape not just the midterms but the  next presidential election who says that  today life won pence goes on to say the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2368079,2373680,supreme court has righted and historic  wrong and reaffirmed the right of the  american people to govern themselves at
UVob8FMT6Rk,2373680,2379599,the state level in a manner consistent  with their values and aspirations he  also says the supreme court has given
UVob8FMT6Rk,2379599,2385119,the american people a new beginning for  life and commends the justices in the  majority for having the courage of their
UVob8FMT6Rk,2385119,2392000,convictions this speaks to an important  point lester which is something you and  chuck talked about a couple of minutes  ago the consequences of the 2016
UVob8FMT6Rk,2392000,2398240,election specifically i was out on the  campaign trail in that campaign talking  with and covering all of the republican
UVob8FMT6Rk,2398240,2403440,candidates essentially and at every  campaign event i went to just about when  i would talk to voters in the room and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2403440,2409680,i'm talking not big rallies but small  rooms in you know iowa and south  carolina and beyond i heard all the time
UVob8FMT6Rk,2409680,2416560,about the supreme court it was a  mobilizing factor for republican voters  70 percent of those voters in 2016 said
UVob8FMT6Rk,2416560,2422240,that the supreme court was a very  important issue for them compared to  just 62 percent of voters who leaned
UVob8FMT6Rk,2422240,2427920,democratic that campaign year you are  seeing that now come to fruition you  heard nancy pelosi reference it here the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2427920,2435359,justices including neil gorsuch brett  kavanaugh amy coney barrett who during  their confirmation hearings said that
UVob8FMT6Rk,2435359,2441040,roe versus wade was a precedent of the  united states supreme court that had  been reaffirmed they all said variations
UVob8FMT6Rk,2441040,2446720,on a theme to that point that is  something that speaker pelosi is raising  now she says were they not telling the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2446720,2452960,truth that is why she sees this she is  hoping that this will be for democrats  now a mobilizing issue in the midterms
UVob8FMT6Rk,2452960,2458240,when you talk about 2016 lester we're  also hearing reaction from the candidate  then hillary clinton who says this
UVob8FMT6Rk,2458240,2463680,decision will live in infamy she says as  a step backward for women's rights and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2463680,2469839,human rights  one of the other pieces of this as we  look at this live shot now outside the  supreme court where i imagine the crowd
UVob8FMT6Rk,2469839,2476000,is growing by the minute is what this  means for the role of the supreme court  in our political discourse and in
UVob8FMT6Rk,2476000,2481440,society at this moment you have seen the  impact just in the last few months  leicester recent polling has found that
UVob8FMT6Rk,2481440,2487680,only 44 of americans see the supreme  court as a non-partisan entity  essentially have trust and faith in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2487680,2494000,court that is down 11  from where that number was in march so  you are seeing that through line happen
UVob8FMT6Rk,2494000,2499760,for the court lester and that is going  to have political implications down the  road all right hallie thanks joining us
UVob8FMT6Rk,2499760,2504800,now is nbc news chief washington  correspondent andrea mitchell uh andrew
UVob8FMT6Rk,2504800,2510400,you were there uh at the beginning of  roe and then you were there now as this
UVob8FMT6Rk,2510400,2517599,historic decision has come down i'm  really curious your thoughts at this  moment  well it's obviously uh you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,2517599,2524079,life-changing uh in so many ways  profound ways as pete was pointing out  to you earlier and then chuck never
UVob8FMT6Rk,2524079,2532079,before has a constitutional right  conferred by the court been taken away  in this one after nearly 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,2532079,2539920,and i was recently covering a group  called the jane's it is a group of women  who organized pre-row in chicago
UVob8FMT6Rk,2539920,2547520,to  break the law and to organize an  underground network if you will of the  so-called jains of women with medical
UVob8FMT6Rk,2547520,2552560,background who could provide illegal  abortions safely because there were so
UVob8FMT6Rk,2552560,2559440,many deaths in those years uh across the  country by women trying to self-abort
UVob8FMT6Rk,2559440,2565920,them you know abort themselves and so  many botched procedures and so many  maternal deaths so
UVob8FMT6Rk,2565920,2571040,this was this  obviously is changing the politics we've  been talking about that you've got
UVob8FMT6Rk,2571040,2577680,states like pennsylvania and michigan  wisconsin where you have  governor's races now where democratic
UVob8FMT6Rk,2577680,2583680,governors are either running for a  re-election or a term limited on our  opposing republicans determined to ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,2583680,2590560,abortion in fact in pennsylvania  mastriana  the candidate there has said it would be  an outright ban no exceptions
UVob8FMT6Rk,2590560,2596880,the legislature in pennsylvania has  repeatedly passed such laws which have  been repeatedly vetoed by the democratic
UVob8FMT6Rk,2596880,2603920,governor the incumbent is term limited  so you've got major states not just in  red states but in blue or purple states
UVob8FMT6Rk,2603920,2609440,where you're going to see major major  changes so it's not just half the  country it's more than half the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,2609440,2615040,where presumably after these midterms  and certainly after 24 you could have
UVob8FMT6Rk,2615040,2620800,more than half the country and of course  the 13 trigger  trigger loss states where it will almost
UVob8FMT6Rk,2620800,2627280,immediately become banned  and there'll be states with with no  exceptions at all this
UVob8FMT6Rk,2627280,2632640,this ruling does  preserve the light of life of the mother  when that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,2632640,2638480,in jeopardy but not rape and incest let  me just point out to to follow up on  something that was just mentioned by
UVob8FMT6Rk,2638480,2646160,halle the confirmation hearings of  justices kavanaugh and alito were  obviously decisive in this case
UVob8FMT6Rk,2646160,2653119,brett kavanaugh a question by dianne  feinstein in 2018  asked what would your position today be
UVob8FMT6Rk,2653119,2660000,on a women's right to choose he answered  as a judge it is an important precedent  of the supreme court by it i mean roe v
UVob8FMT6Rk,2660000,2666800,wade and planned parenthood v casey  they have been reaffirmed many times  casey is precedent on precedent which
UVob8FMT6Rk,2666800,2674480,itself is an important factor to  remember kavanaugh said and more of what  amy coney barrett said just in 2020
UVob8FMT6Rk,2674480,2681359,again dianne feinstein questioning her  what i will commit is that i will obey  all the rules of starry decisis
UVob8FMT6Rk,2681359,2687920,referring to the doctrine of courts  giving way to president but then went on  to say for any issue that comes up
UVob8FMT6Rk,2687920,2694720,abortion or anything else i'll follow  the law  then there's some  wiggle room because amy klobuchar asked
UVob8FMT6Rk,2694720,2701520,barrett  about  roe v wade being a super president and  barrett replied that that term is used
UVob8FMT6Rk,2701520,2708720,in quote scholarship  in an article that she has defined it so  she left some academic wiggle room there
UVob8FMT6Rk,2708720,2714160,gorsuch as well in 2017 said i would  tell you that roe v wade is decided in
UVob8FMT6Rk,2714160,2719839,1973 is a president of the u.s supreme  court it has been reaffirmed so
UVob8FMT6Rk,2719839,2725760,there is the issue of whether these  trump  justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,2725760,2733359,actually misled the senate of the united  states and the public in what they said  during confirmations
UVob8FMT6Rk,2733359,2738400,the country's already divided we are  seeing it now in the hearings that we've  been living through for the last few
UVob8FMT6Rk,2738400,2746079,weeks the fifth one just yesterday there  is such a division in this country  politically red versus blue trump versus
UVob8FMT6Rk,2746079,2752640,anti-trump but this clearly is making  the issue of a woman's right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,2752640,2759599,the preeminent issue in the midterms and  in the 2024 elections and further  dividing the country in a hugely
UVob8FMT6Rk,2759599,2766960,polarizing way lester andrea mitchell we  we greatly appreciate your historical  perspective there kristin hawkins is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2766960,2773119,president of students for life of  america and joins us now kristin uh good  morning and thank you for joining us can
UVob8FMT6Rk,2773119,2780400,you give us your reaction to what you  the ruling and some of what you're  hearing today
UVob8FMT6Rk,2781040,2788400,well this has been a ruling that's 49  years in the making to see the supreme  court reverse the egregious wrong of roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,2788400,2795119,v wade and dove versus bolton it's a  historic moment and for all of us in the  pro-life generation who could have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,2795119,2802000,aborted for the place of a playstation  our mothers told that our existence  didn't matter it's a significant moment
UVob8FMT6Rk,2802000,2808640,it's a moment where we know we have a  lot of responsibility as we become the  first post road generation as we ensure
UVob8FMT6Rk,2808640,2815359,that no woman stands alone in the post  throw america as we support more than 3  000 pregnancy centers and 400 maternity
UVob8FMT6Rk,2815359,2822720,homes across the nation which vastly  outnumber the number of predatory  abortion facilities does your in your  view does your work end now is this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,2822720,2827839,this the ultimate victory or where do  you see this going  no
UVob8FMT6Rk,2827839,2834079,absolutely not this was phase one in our  objective in the pro-life movement to  make abortion unthinkable throughout our
UVob8FMT6Rk,2834079,2839599,country this is why we have more than  thirteen hundred chapters in college and  high school campuses across the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,2839599,2844880,not only are we talking and engaging  with those who are directly targeted by  the predatory abortion industry but
UVob8FMT6Rk,2844880,2851359,we're the ones actually transforming the  campus policies to make sure no woman  ever again feels like she has to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,2851359,2857440,between the life of her life of her  child and her education we actually have  a very progressive view this is 2022.
UVob8FMT6Rk,2857440,2863920,yeah kristin in some of these states  that they don't recognize uh  rape or incest
UVob8FMT6Rk,2863920,2869040,would you like more clarity where do you  where do you stand there
UVob8FMT6Rk,2870079,2877440,i would say that my very good friend  ryan who was conceived out of sexual  assault  his life matters and the circumstance of
UVob8FMT6Rk,2877440,2885040,your conception does not deem you  unworthy of life is that going to divide  the movement my father today would go
UVob8FMT6Rk,2885040,2892800,um no i think there's going to be a lot  of conversations in the pro-life  movement as we move forward state by  state today hopefully 880 babies will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,2892800,2898319,saved tomorrow in 26 states who should  move quickly to make abortion a thing of
UVob8FMT6Rk,2898319,2903359,the past and to end this gruesome  violence but we're going to have a lot  of strategy discussions in the coming
UVob8FMT6Rk,2903359,2909200,weeks and months as you know because  reversing rovers way doesn't end our  fight we will now go state by state and
UVob8FMT6Rk,2909200,2914640,with a trained army of 150 000 young  people the post-throw generation is  ready to do that all right kristen thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,2914640,2920160,you for taking time and being with us  and expressing your views i want to go  right to nbc news justice correspondent
UVob8FMT6Rk,2920160,2926079,pete williams pete we've had a little  over an hour now to  digest this you've had a chance to go
UVob8FMT6Rk,2926079,2932160,through the  entire ruling what stands out what  should people know  well first of all uh i think we have to
UVob8FMT6Rk,2932160,2937200,say again this is five to four on  overturning rose six to three on  upholding the mississippi law that bans
UVob8FMT6Rk,2937200,2943440,abortion after  uh 15 weeks of pregnancy  secondly uh it's justice chief justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,2943440,2950000,roberts who doesn't join the majority he  says that's going too far too fast  the majority opinion does say and we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,2950000,2956559,noted this before that justice alito who  wrote it said  nothing in this opinion should be read
UVob8FMT6Rk,2956559,2963040,to cast doubt on any of the court's  other presidents that found  constitutional rights that were not
UVob8FMT6Rk,2963040,2968640,explicitly mentioned such as the right  to interracial marriage the right to  contraception the right to same-sex
UVob8FMT6Rk,2968640,2974559,marriage he says abortion is different  because it involves a potential life and  only chief
UVob8FMT6Rk,2974559,2979599,only justice clarence thomas  of all of the nine so far said well the
UVob8FMT6Rk,2979599,2986079,court should actually go back and look  at those precedents too  secondly of course as we've noted before
UVob8FMT6Rk,2986079,2992640,half the states will now probably ban  abortion roughly half and 13 of them  have laws already on the book so-called
UVob8FMT6Rk,2992640,2999599,trigger laws and missouri now says it's  the first state to have its trigger loss  spring into effect its attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,2999599,3005359,eric schmidt  has already issued a letter many of  these state laws trigger laws said that
UVob8FMT6Rk,3005359,3011920,the the triggering event would be the  supreme court's decision followed by  some kind of analysis by the state's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3011920,3017680,attorney general that that's what the  supreme court has done he's already got  a letter out saying it's now illegal in
UVob8FMT6Rk,3017680,3022880,missouri so missouri appears to be the  first state  there's a couple of others that will
UVob8FMT6Rk,3022880,3027920,follow very quickly in the other trigger  states it's a matter of 10 days or 30
UVob8FMT6Rk,3027920,3033440,days so it's not going to be abortion is  now not immediately illegal in all of
UVob8FMT6Rk,3033440,3039520,those  states in which it was likely to become  illegal but it will be probably within
UVob8FMT6Rk,3039520,3045760,a month to take full effect lester in  terms of all those other states yeah let  me go back to what you said though about
UVob8FMT6Rk,3045760,3052880,this notion that this wouldn't be used  as a as a precedent to to undo other  constitutional rights uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,3052880,3058640,it's said in the ruling but is it  binding  well no not at all i mean that that's i
UVob8FMT6Rk,3058640,3064800,think what concerns for example  advocates of same-sex marriage because  the logic of the supreme court's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3064800,3069920,decision in in this majority opinion is  precisely what we read about in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3069920,3076960,leaked opinion that was written in  february this opinion here uh this  majority opinion is largely unchanged i
UVob8FMT6Rk,3076960,3082079,mean there's some references to the  descent and some other things but the  logic of it is still what was laid out
UVob8FMT6Rk,3082079,3087200,in february what what justice alito and  the majority says today is that there is
UVob8FMT6Rk,3087200,3093119,no explicit mention of a right to  abortion in the constitution so the  question is did it somehow was it
UVob8FMT6Rk,3093119,3100400,somehow granted by the 14th amendment  and he says the test for that is it has  to be deeply rooted uh in the nation's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3100400,3108240,history and traditions and part of the  concept of ordered liberty and he says  it flunks that test well of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,3108240,3115920,same-sex marriage would flunk that test  too there was no protection for  contraception at the founding so
UVob8FMT6Rk,3115920,3123119,by the court's logic here those  presidents could be in danger several of  the justices go out of their way to say
UVob8FMT6Rk,3123119,3130240,no it won't make any difference justice  kavanaugh says in his in his concurrence  today overruling roe does not mean the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3130240,3135280,overruling of those precedents and does  not he emphasizes the word not threaten
UVob8FMT6Rk,3135280,3141440,or cast doubt on those precedents so i  think you know take them at their word  but there is certainly you could you
UVob8FMT6Rk,3141440,3147359,could argue the seeds of destruction for  those in this opinion all right pete  thank you and on that right side of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,3147359,3153119,your screen you continue to view the  protests the celebrations  how you described and really depends on
UVob8FMT6Rk,3153119,3159200,where people are but clearly a lot of  emotion has spilled out on the steps of  the supreme court after this historic
UVob8FMT6Rk,3159200,3166800,ruling the court overturning roe v wade  dr cheryl hamlin is with the jackson  mississippi women's health organization
UVob8FMT6Rk,3166800,3173440,doctor can you tell us what this means  for  you  and your organization
UVob8FMT6Rk,3173440,3179200,well i guess  um  you know as soon as the attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,3179200,3184640,signs that we have a few days before the  the clinic is closed  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,3184640,3189680,and so you know for the women of  mississippi and the other 13
UVob8FMT6Rk,3189680,3195359,states that have trigger laws  they  will no longer have access to abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,3195359,3200559,in any form um and so for them  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,3200559,3205760,you know it means that  i mean i'm sure that if
UVob8FMT6Rk,3205760,3213520,you know women are having miscarriages  especially  [Music]  you know especially uh you know poor and
UVob8FMT6Rk,3213520,3219920,women of color they'll um  be placed under scrutiny did they do  this to themselves i'm sure that women
UVob8FMT6Rk,3219920,3226000,who do make it out of state to get a  procedure when they return we'll be  afraid to seek medical care
UVob8FMT6Rk,3226000,3231040,um some people will self abort some  people will continue dangerous pregnancy
UVob8FMT6Rk,3231040,3236800,so i mean it's obviously  devastating  for these women well doctor tell me what
UVob8FMT6Rk,3236800,3241839,are the options um  for a woman in your community who
UVob8FMT6Rk,3241839,3249440,has decided she wants an abortion what  what do the options become in terms of  how far travel may be
UVob8FMT6Rk,3249440,3255599,yeah so um illinois is probably the  closest state i mean i think it's  probably a
UVob8FMT6Rk,3255599,3262040,seven hour drive or something to the  closest clinic um new mexico is about a  10 hour drive
UVob8FMT6Rk,3262040,3267680,massachusetts um you know it's a 22 hour  drive um
UVob8FMT6Rk,3267680,3273680,there's always the abs  option of getting  pills through the mail and you know i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,3273680,3280160,sure a lot of people are going to be  seeking out how  how to do that um you know i'm also sure
UVob8FMT6Rk,3280160,3285599,the state will make that illegal but may  be hard to enforce so um
UVob8FMT6Rk,3285599,3293119,you know those will be the options are  you hearing from uh from patients even  today even since this ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,3293119,3298319,um  in the past hour no i haven't heard from  anybody but i'm you know obviously
UVob8FMT6Rk,3298319,3304079,people that already have appointments  are going to be calling and figuring out  what they need to do okay dr hamlin
UVob8FMT6Rk,3304079,3309839,thank you for taking a moment to speak  to us we appreciate it  nbc news chief white house correspondent
UVob8FMT6Rk,3309839,3315280,peter alexander joins us now  peter are we going to hear from the  president
UVob8FMT6Rk,3315280,3320960,yeah lester we have now just learned  that president biden will address this  abortion ruling from the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,3320960,3326000,at 12 30 eastern time that's roughly an  hour and 10 minutes from now he'll be
UVob8FMT6Rk,3326000,3331359,speaking inside what's called the cross  hall that's within the white house  residence where he has delivered remarks
UVob8FMT6Rk,3331359,3337119,on other  historically significant  days the white house i i can tell you i
UVob8FMT6Rk,3337119,3342640,think was caught off guard by this  ruling coming today not that the  decision would come they had expected it
UVob8FMT6Rk,3342640,3347680,based on frankly that draft that came  out about six to eight weeks ago but as
UVob8FMT6Rk,3347680,3353680,i spoke to an aide a little bit earlier  i told them that the ruling had been  made on abortion they were leaving the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3353680,3359040,campus and quickly turned around to  gather in preparation for the  president's reaction to this but they
UVob8FMT6Rk,3359040,3366319,have been bracing for this moment to  take place in some form for a matter of  weeks meeting with those anti with those
UVob8FMT6Rk,3366319,3372400,abortion rights advocates meeting with  lawmakers and others and there's  obviously been growing pressure on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,3372400,3378240,white house to react not just  preemptively there was a hope that the  white house might make some  announcements in advance but certainly
UVob8FMT6Rk,3378240,3384799,as soon as this ruling came in the  pressure certainly from abortion rights  advocates is that the president would do
UVob8FMT6Rk,3384799,3392559,what he can within his power in terms of  executive action specifically perhaps  expanding access to reproductive
UVob8FMT6Rk,3392559,3398480,health care on federal lands and  separately to increase access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3398480,3404079,medication abortion medications  specifically pills right now which  account for more than half of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3404079,3410240,abortions in this country at the time as  you try to get a better understanding of  where the country is on this issue nbc
UVob8FMT6Rk,3410240,3417200,news recently completed a poll on it and  just to be specific 60 percent of  americans said in that recent poll that
UVob8FMT6Rk,3417200,3423359,americans  believe that abortion should be either  always legal or legal most of the time
UVob8FMT6Rk,3423359,3428400,compared to 37 percent who said abortion  should be illegal either with exceptions
UVob8FMT6Rk,3428400,3433440,or without exceptions so that gives you  a sense broadly of where the country is
UVob8FMT6Rk,3433440,3439359,on this issue among the biggest concerns  that the white house has been  communicating is how this is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3439359,3444799,impact those poor  minority women low-income women across
UVob8FMT6Rk,3444799,3449920,this country whose access  particularly in the south and the  midwest they have said was already
UVob8FMT6Rk,3449920,3455680,limited even before this ruling on roe v  wade the struggle to get abortion care
UVob8FMT6Rk,3455680,3461680,was limited due to a variety of things  including insurance coverage in some  places that was impacted by what's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3461680,3466799,called a high hyde amendment doesn't  allow federal money to be spent on um on
UVob8FMT6Rk,3466799,3472880,abortions and also due to waiting  periods that exist as well we have heard  from the white house in the course of
UVob8FMT6Rk,3472880,3480480,the last several weeks they have been  very upset and frustrated by this  expected ruling by
UVob8FMT6Rk,3480480,3486960,by the decisions taking place  earlier in mississippi referring to them  as unconstitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,3486960,3492960,attacks on women's reproductive rights  lester all right peter alexander the  white house where we will be hearing
UVob8FMT6Rk,3492960,3499839,from the president about 12 30 eastern  time a little over an hour from now  uh if uh remains on schedule let's be
UVob8FMT6Rk,3499839,3506240,bring in nbc news legal analyst carol  lamb she's a former u.s attorney and  federal prosecutor carol thank you for
UVob8FMT6Rk,3506240,3511359,being here first just the nuts and bolts  here  so i want to get the terminology right
UVob8FMT6Rk,3511359,3516400,abortion is not illegal but it is no  longer a constitutional right is that  correct
UVob8FMT6Rk,3516400,3522400,that's absolutely correct lester this is  not a ban a total ban on abortion that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3522400,3529440,been decided by the supreme court what  this does is it changes the approach to  abortion it says that women don't no
UVob8FMT6Rk,3529440,3535520,longer women no longer have a  fundamental constitutional right to make  the decision regarding terminating their
UVob8FMT6Rk,3535520,3542160,pregnancy at any stage of the pregnancy  that is no longer a protected right  under the u.s constitution and what that
UVob8FMT6Rk,3542160,3547520,does is it throws the decision back to  each individual state so each state
UVob8FMT6Rk,3547520,3553760,legislature under its own state  constitution  makes the decision whether a woman has
UVob8FMT6Rk,3553760,3560480,access to an abortion and all the  parameters around that decision at what  stage of the abortion or whether there's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3560480,3566079,a ban a ban on abortions in that state  entirely that is now an issue for each
UVob8FMT6Rk,3566079,3571359,state legislature stepping away from  from whatever side you may fall on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3571359,3577599,fact that the supreme court has now  taken away a right that it had  originally granted can you talk to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3577599,3584240,significance of that legally  you know lester this has to be the uh a
UVob8FMT6Rk,3584240,3591440,co-equal headline in addition to the  fact that this decision impacts so many  people in the country uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,3591440,3597760,all at once  the co-equal headline really has to be  what does this mean for past cases in
UVob8FMT6Rk,3597760,3604000,other areas where the court has relied  on a personal privacy and personal  liberty right
UVob8FMT6Rk,3604000,3610720,of of an individual pete wilson talked  about this earlier birth control  contraception
UVob8FMT6Rk,3610720,3616880,gay marriage uh sodomy laws there there  are a lot of laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,3616880,3622079,that have been struck down in the past  50 years because the court has found
UVob8FMT6Rk,3622079,3628880,a right to privacy and personal liberty  in the constitution what happened here  today is that one school of thought
UVob8FMT6Rk,3628880,3633920,about how you interpret the constitution  has prevailed over a different thought
UVob8FMT6Rk,3633920,3641280,the  in the past 50 years  justices on the supreme court have said  that there is an implicit right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3641280,3646480,privacy in the constitution it is not  enumerated the way the second amendment
UVob8FMT6Rk,3646480,3651839,protects gun rights in the constitution  and what the court said today is no
UVob8FMT6Rk,3651839,3658559,abortion rights are not  explicitly called out in the  constitution and when that happens you
UVob8FMT6Rk,3658559,3665040,have to look to history and tradition in  the nation to figure out whether there  is such a right and they found that
UVob8FMT6Rk,3665040,3671280,there was no such right in the history  and tradition of the nature but  that could be said as well for
UVob8FMT6Rk,3671280,3676480,homosexual marriage and um and gay  rights in general and most specifically
UVob8FMT6Rk,3676480,3684240,contraception or birth control there are  some states now that have proposed bans  on iuds because of the way iuds work
UVob8FMT6Rk,3684240,3692000,people think of them as contraception  but in some cases they can interfere  with the embedding of a fertilized egg
UVob8FMT6Rk,3692000,3698079,in the woman and they say  that is a form of abortion so you can  see the cracks already beginning to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3698079,3705040,occur right and that's what we thought  were fundamentally i just want to go  back and look at justice alito's  thinking this idea that those other
UVob8FMT6Rk,3705040,3710079,those other rights don't involve a life  the does the logic follow there when you
UVob8FMT6Rk,3710079,3715599,start taking that piece by piece does it  become a harder argument he makes and by  the way is that door still open no
UVob8FMT6Rk,3715599,3721599,matter what he may say about that is  that door still open to go back and  revisit these other rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,3721599,3727200,exactly what you said  right now lester that door is still open  because justice alito said this both in
UVob8FMT6Rk,3727200,3733359,the leaked draft in that was leaked in  may and this opinion  uh he said oh this applies only to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3733359,3740640,abortion it doesn't apply to those other  decisions um that is what is known as  dicta that in in legal circles that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,3740640,3746400,known as victor which means that is  saying something that is not essential  to the holding of this case and when it
UVob8FMT6Rk,3746400,3753359,is not essential to the holding of the  case it has no binding presidential  value so justice solido might be trying
UVob8FMT6Rk,3753359,3761520,to make this go down a little bit easier  but the logic of his opinion as the  justice thomas has pointed out is uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,3761520,3768480,is that these cases are now vulnerable  these other rights does this ever go  back before the court uh is there is
UVob8FMT6Rk,3768480,3775920,there a case that could reopen the door  on this ultimate decision  uh that it would require what happened
UVob8FMT6Rk,3775920,3782799,in this case it would require a case  being teed up and a case is not going to  be teed up for revisiting this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,3782799,3787839,until the side that tees it up thinks  that it has the votes to make a
UVob8FMT6Rk,3787839,3794240,revisiting happen and that is likely not  to happen for uh for a long time all  right carol lim thanks for walking us
UVob8FMT6Rk,3794240,3800720,through some of that we appreciate it i  want to bring back nbc washington  correspondent yamiche alcindor
UVob8FMT6Rk,3800720,3806960,yamiche we've heard some reaction  including from speaker pelosi we've  heard those on the right obviously
UVob8FMT6Rk,3806960,3813839,celebrating  what for them is a long hard battle and  final victory here um
UVob8FMT6Rk,3813839,3819839,over the last hour and a half tell me  how this is you know some of the themes  that you're seeing strike up
UVob8FMT6Rk,3819839,3826960,well this really of course as you noted  is the culmination of a conservative  goal to overturn roe v wade in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,3826960,3832160,country undoing precedent of nearly 50  years and what we've been hearing from  the conservative movement is that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,3832160,3837760,is a really big win for them we heard  from vice president mike pence who said  this is righting or wrong i was also
UVob8FMT6Rk,3837760,3844640,looking for right action from former  president trump and while he has not put  out a message just yet at least from  what i last just checked what he has
UVob8FMT6Rk,3844640,3850319,done is put out already a message from  la from yesterday um when the supreme  court ruled on guns and he said there
UVob8FMT6Rk,3850319,3857280,and i want to read it because i think  it's it's incredibly important he said  elections have consequences i promise to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3857280,3863200,appoint justices and judges that would  stand up for the constitution and today  the supreme court upheld in that case
UVob8FMT6Rk,3863200,3869520,the second amendment right of all  americans but you can imagine that that  same language about elections having  consequences and about the fact that the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3869520,3874880,justices are standing by the  constitution can also be applied to  today so we can expect former president
UVob8FMT6Rk,3874880,3880720,trump to also take a victory lap here  because of course this is because he was  able to put on conservative supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,3880720,3887599,court justices that now roe v wade has  been overturned i've also been listening  to democrats of course nancy pelosi in
UVob8FMT6Rk,3887599,3893359,particular who talked about the fact  that this really is not going to stand  talking about the fact that reproductive
UVob8FMT6Rk,3893359,3898960,freedom will be on the ballot in  november that says something about where  democrats want to message this and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3898960,3904559,idea that they're going to be making the  case in the states in elections that  people should vote for democrats to try
UVob8FMT6Rk,3904559,3910960,to get some sort of rectification from  there's some sort of change rather when  it comes to access to abortions but i
UVob8FMT6Rk,3910960,3916799,should tell you um in talking to  democrats they're sort of scrambling the  political will is there to do something
UVob8FMT6Rk,3916799,3922559,but the actual plan to do something is  not clear i also heard from a number of  people calling this egregious saying
UVob8FMT6Rk,3922559,3928160,that black women in particular women of  color poor women that they're gonna have  to really figure out how to how to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3928160,3933599,mobilize them um to vote in november but  also of course at the same time as  they're mobilizing them to the ballot
UVob8FMT6Rk,3933599,3940559,box they're gonna have to mobilize them  to different clinics because they're  going to have to be balancing what now  is going to be such restricted access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,3940559,3947200,abortion so there's a lot here on the  political side here to talk about one  last thing when it comes to sort of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3947200,3953680,politics of this and the midterms it's  been democrats that have not really been  able to culminate and really focus their
UVob8FMT6Rk,3953680,3960160,energy on abortion in the way that  republicans have this has been a talking  point for republicans over and over
UVob8FMT6Rk,3960160,3965280,again so many people that i interviewed  when i was talking to them about former  president trump and his brash nature
UVob8FMT6Rk,3965280,3971359,people would tell me that they didn't  like it that they didn't like the way  that he tweeted or they didn't like the  way that he talked or the revolving door
UVob8FMT6Rk,3971359,3976799,of people leaving the white house in and  out but that they were with him because  they believed that abortion could be
UVob8FMT6Rk,3976799,3982799,overturned so that was the conservative  messaging that's a well-oiled machine  that they've really been working on but
UVob8FMT6Rk,3982799,3989119,for democrats they're now going to have  to build a machine to explain to people  and to make the case to people in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,3989119,3995119,middle of inflation in the middle of a  pandemic in the middle of gun rights and  all sorts of debates that abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,3995119,4000640,should be the thing that's that's up on  their minds that is the most important  thing the priority for them um and we
UVob8FMT6Rk,4000640,4007119,know that of course there are a lot of  women in this country who will now be  using their voices and their stories to  be making the political case that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,4007119,4013359,decision should be tried to be  overturned in some way um through  politics but it's a very very hard
UVob8FMT6Rk,4013359,4019200,complicated and rough road ahead for  democrats who are going to be trying to  to change what the consequences of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,4019200,4025440,this decision will mean for women across  this country yamiche thank you joining  us in the conversation nbc senior
UVob8FMT6Rk,4025440,4030960,washington correspondent hallie jackson  with more on what the decision could  mean and and hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,4030960,4036480,you know we're hearing from speaker  pelosi and and others on the left we're  going to fight this we're going to make
UVob8FMT6Rk,4036480,4042559,this part of the the midterms but bottom  line is democrats are demoralized today
UVob8FMT6Rk,4042559,4049280,if you're a democrat you're going where  do we go next right you're trying to  figure that out but there is not an easy  or clear answer given the makeup of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4049280,4054319,supreme court as it sits now you've got  i mean take the take the other two  branches right on the executive branch
UVob8FMT6Rk,4054319,4059359,side we're going to hear from president  biden in just about an hour from now he  has been under pressure from democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,4059359,4065280,to try to do something unilaterally were  this to be the case we'll see what he  says there on the legislative branch you
UVob8FMT6Rk,4065280,4070400,have action from congress we are going  to lester we're learning we're going to  see some of the first action next month
UVob8FMT6Rk,4070400,4076160,in a matter of weeks when the senate is  back from its recess with the judiciary  committee set to hold a hearing we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,4076160,4082960,just learning this in from the chairman  to explore what they call the grim  reality of a post row america of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,4082960,4088640,the senate judiciary committee led by a  democratic chairman so that will be i  think some of the first glimpses we will
UVob8FMT6Rk,4088640,4095039,get from a really practical concrete  level as to what democrats could do  particularly on the senate side in order
UVob8FMT6Rk,4095039,4101040,to take some kind of action to shore up  the protections of roe that speaker  pelosi has talked about let me put some
UVob8FMT6Rk,4101040,4106640,numbers behind the conversation that  we're having lester some data here right  according to our nbc news polling when
UVob8FMT6Rk,4106640,4112560,you talk about the number of americans  who believe that abortion is the most  important issue facing this country it
UVob8FMT6Rk,4112560,4118000,was practically non-existent if you were  to ask let's say six months ago only  three percent of americans said it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,4118000,4123520,the most important issue that jumped  just last month to 10 now right after
UVob8FMT6Rk,4123520,4128560,the leaked ruling the leaked decision i  should say came out uh in early may you
UVob8FMT6Rk,4128560,4134318,saw that number rise that is a number  that i think democrats are looking at to  say okay now we have the decision it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,4134318,4142159,no longer theoretical it is real it is  practical and we will in a matter of you  know 10 to 30 days to three months see
UVob8FMT6Rk,4142159,4149600,the real implications of that in states  across the country i think there is a  bet being made that that number will go  up more people will feel mobilized by it
UVob8FMT6Rk,4149600,4156000,you also have  when you look at the supreme court in  this decision the question that comes up  is the court out of step with what the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4156000,4162798,majority of americans want 63 percent of  americans thought roe versus wage should  not be overturned compared to only about
UVob8FMT6Rk,4162798,4168400,30 percent who thought it should be  right so that gives you a sense i think  across the country of where people are
UVob8FMT6Rk,4168400,4174719,that said for republicans of course  those numbers are inverted only about a  third of republicans uh believed that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4174719,4180080,abortion should be legal in all or most  instances so that is the landscape that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4180080,4185120,we're in at this moment in time what we  what we should be looking for right in  addition to next month what congress is
UVob8FMT6Rk,4185120,4192000,going to do what specific actions they  will take because right now and you  heard it a little bit lester in your  interview with senator amy klobuchar the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4192000,4197040,sense that this is i think she said  something like this isn't the time for  politics this is the time to sort of
UVob8FMT6Rk,4197040,4203920,grieve the loss of this right for women  i hear her saying that but also there is
UVob8FMT6Rk,4203920,4209679,undeniably a political angle to this  moving forward for abortion rights  advocates who see this fight as not
UVob8FMT6Rk,4209679,4216080,being over  abortion anti-abortion activists also  see the fight as not being over because  they want to go even further and they
UVob8FMT6Rk,4216080,4221360,have said this to you they've said this  to me and to others that they see the  fight now as trying to
UVob8FMT6Rk,4221360,4228239,trying to shore up  anti-abortion support in more states and  in more ways including on the federal
UVob8FMT6Rk,4228239,4233520,picture too so that is where we're  seeing this kind of coalesce lester and  then hallie if you recall there were a
UVob8FMT6Rk,4233520,4239040,lot of conversations about expanding the  court what happens to that conversation  you know it's a great question lester
UVob8FMT6Rk,4239040,4245280,there was not much appetite for that at  all that came up a lot in the 2020  campaign especially in the democratic  primary should we do this should
UVob8FMT6Rk,4245280,4250320,democrats do this was the question that  they were asking and in this instance  you didn't see any appetite from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4250320,4257280,white house on that there was a report  that came out  that is a politically tough
UVob8FMT6Rk,4257280,4262960,discussion to have because of  specifically some more moderate  democratic senators for example who
UVob8FMT6Rk,4262960,4269120,would resist that and who have said that  they would not be open to changing that  framework  you asked does this change the game i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,4269120,4275760,looking at a response from senator joe  manchin for example who has been as you  well know  one of the thorns in the side if you
UVob8FMT6Rk,4275760,4280880,will for his fellow democratic  colleagues who have been wanting him in  many ways to take action on things that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4280880,4286719,the rest of the party wanted senator  manchin along with senator kirsten  cinema for example just for the  political landscape has been one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4286719,4293520,people who has resisted some of the  moves for example changing senate rules  to allow democrats to get things done
UVob8FMT6Rk,4293520,4300080,unilaterally with just 50 votes instead  of 60 which is the threshold now  he says he is deeply disappointed that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4300080,4306080,the court has voted to overturn roe he  talks about how he was raised pro-life  as a catholic and he says and i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,4306080,4311760,quoting him i will always consider  myself pro-life but he says he would  support legislation that would codify
UVob8FMT6Rk,4311760,4317040,the rights that roe previously protected  right a vote of support for some action  on the federal level to codify those
UVob8FMT6Rk,4317040,4324320,rights the question is is it enough we  just don't know at this point okay  hallie thank you joining us now is nbc  news contributor and editor and ceo of
UVob8FMT6Rk,4324320,4329600,the dispatch stephen hayes stephen we  appreciate you joining us uh you've  heard a lot of this conversation about
UVob8FMT6Rk,4329600,4336320,the political implications i'm curious  to hear your views  yeah it's very interesting i think if  you asked pro-lifers before this
UVob8FMT6Rk,4336320,4342400,decision came down what results they  would like to come out of this decision  one of them would be the kinds of things
UVob8FMT6Rk,4342400,4348480,that you heard from yamiche and hallie a  political discussion a political debate  that has basically been foreclosed in
UVob8FMT6Rk,4348480,4353600,many respects because the court did what  it did in 1973 with roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,4353600,4359600,conservatives republicans pro-lifers  have made the argument that this is a  decision that this is a debate best had
UVob8FMT6Rk,4359600,4366719,in a political context now make these  decisions have these debates it'll be  very interesting to to learn whether the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4366719,4372159,uptick that we've seen  in the number of people responding to  pollsters saying that abortion is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4372159,4377760,most important issue or one of the most  important issues  if that continues um you've seen sort of
UVob8FMT6Rk,4377760,4383679,a sea change in the way that we look at  abortion culturally in the country uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,4383679,4390880,over the past 50 years even as the laws  have remained the same it'll be very  interesting to see if that cultural uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,4390880,4396640,change turns into a political change  and and what what the the immediate
UVob8FMT6Rk,4396640,4402480,pressure on democrats to do something  and there will be that call to do  something what in the short term what
UVob8FMT6Rk,4402480,4407600,can they do  yeah i mean i think  you know as hallie was pointing out
UVob8FMT6Rk,4407600,4413920,you're already seeing statements from  democrats from nancy pelosi from others  looking to take steps that they can take
UVob8FMT6Rk,4413920,4421679,politically either in federal  legislation in state houses around the  country to try to codify some of the the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4421679,4428159,rules that were in place with roe v wade  certainly i think democrats are going to  make this a political issue democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,4428159,4434320,want to run on this they would certainly  for political i think practical  political reasons uh like to use it to
UVob8FMT6Rk,4434320,4440800,avoid conversations about things like  the economy about inflation  about some of the other things that have
UVob8FMT6Rk,4440800,4447760,president biden's approval ratings is  sort of cratering at this point um but i  think that that we'll see a very quick
UVob8FMT6Rk,4447760,4454159,move from democrats to try to introduce  these these kinds of uh additional
UVob8FMT6Rk,4454159,4459600,codifications of roe in both at both the  federal level and in states around the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4459600,4464719,country all right uh stephen thank you  we've been watching that crowd on the  steps of the supreme court and as i said
UVob8FMT6Rk,4464719,4470560,it's a microcosm of this country right  now there are people  who are gleeful they are celebrating
UVob8FMT6Rk,4470560,4477679,this decision there are people who are  upset  uh angry  and somewhat bewildered by all this
UVob8FMT6Rk,4477679,4482880,let's bring in nbc's maura barrett who's  with the crowds who have gathered  outside the supreme court and i know
UVob8FMT6Rk,4482880,4488080,you're hearing it from both sides maura  yeah lester the way that you just
UVob8FMT6Rk,4488080,4494480,contextualized it is completely accurate  it's a very mixed bag here on the crowd  on the ground and the crowd has just
UVob8FMT6Rk,4494480,4500320,quadrupled if not more since the  original since the decision came down  just after 10 a.m i'm still right in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4500320,4507520,middle of it just outside in front of  the supreme court and what i have  noticed while we've seen a mix of  opinions it is a plurality of young
UVob8FMT6Rk,4507520,4513920,people and i want to bring in nina she  traveled in from pennsylvania and she  was one of the the people that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,4513920,4520560,celebrating the decision being  overturned so nina i want to ask you  what what drove you to come out here  today what are you looking for and and
UVob8FMT6Rk,4520560,4525600,tell me a little bit about how you're  feeling now that we saw the decision  come down well as you can see i'm very
UVob8FMT6Rk,4525600,4532239,excited i i drove down here for students  for life we are um we have a bunch of
UVob8FMT6Rk,4532239,4538560,collectives and leadership programs  focused on making sure women have the  necessary resources that they need
UVob8FMT6Rk,4538560,4544560,throughout their pregnancy and i'm  i'm excited but we all as if you can you
UVob8FMT6Rk,4544560,4551280,can see the celebration but we all know  this is not where the work ends this is  where it begins because from
UVob8FMT6Rk,4551280,4556719,anyone you can ask this is what we'll be  working for for the rest of our lives to  make abortion illegal unthinkable and
UVob8FMT6Rk,4556719,4562080,unnecessary  and our nbc polling has shown that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4562080,4568400,sixty percent of women think sixty  percent of americans think that abortion  should be legal in some capacity 30
UVob8FMT6Rk,4568400,4574400,uh are on the other side of it what do  you make that your your group is kind of  in the minority on this and what do you
UVob8FMT6Rk,4574400,4580400,want to say to other people who don't  share the same opinions as you i mean  there are there's a lot to
UVob8FMT6Rk,4580400,4586320,obviously there's a lot of nuances a lot  of um  different opinions but at the end of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4586320,4592239,day human rights begin at conception  that they end at natural death and  that's what we're fighting for so no
UVob8FMT6Rk,4592239,4598239,matter what you believe  we're here to protect the woman and the  child  thank you so much for sharing your
UVob8FMT6Rk,4598239,4604880,thoughts and so lester like we just  talked about there is a big variety of  opinions on the grounds right now but we
UVob8FMT6Rk,4604880,4610560,do hear a lot of celebration and music  playing here today uh and and people
UVob8FMT6Rk,4610560,4616080,that that  weren't necessarily expecting this to  come down today most people that i've
UVob8FMT6Rk,4616080,4622080,talked to were thinking that it was  going to be  that early next week that this decision  would come and so it is interesting to
UVob8FMT6Rk,4622080,4628000,see as the crowd continues to grow  now that this decision has come through  and we'll continue to talk to people on
UVob8FMT6Rk,4628000,4634640,the ground especially as we know that  the president had previously said uh  prior to the decision coming down that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4634640,4641199,he was hoping that congress  would take action to restore roe we have  heard rumblings about house democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,4641199,4646880,coming down and we'll keep an eye out  for lawmakers that are here as well  maura thank you for the update there
UVob8FMT6Rk,4646880,4653760,from the steps of the supreme court  reaction  to today's ruling i'm joined now by  michigan's democratic governor gretchen
UVob8FMT6Rk,4653760,4659920,whitmer  governor thank you for being with us  you're a state that's had an  anti-abortion law in place since since
UVob8FMT6Rk,4659920,4665360,the 30s  but but essentially lived under the the  world of roe v wade what is your
UVob8FMT6Rk,4665360,4671120,reaction  well it's devastating i i know it's not  surprising but it is devastating and
UVob8FMT6Rk,4671120,4676800,this is not the end of the story we've  got a lot of work to do we're fighting  like hell here in michigan to protect
UVob8FMT6Rk,4676800,4682239,michigan women's access to abortion and  reproductive health care but this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,4682239,4689040,really stark moment in america and a  huge setback for  every generation younger than me
UVob8FMT6Rk,4689040,4695679,who now will have fewer rights than my  generation all has had our whole lives  you've got a republican legislature
UVob8FMT6Rk,4695679,4702080,there  can you give us an idea of the battles  to come  oh yeah absolutely i mean they've
UVob8FMT6Rk,4702080,4707600,already um they're at work already so  reverting to this 1931 law is part of
UVob8FMT6Rk,4707600,4715120,the story it would be michigan would go  from being a pro-choice eight to being a  felony no exceptions for rape or incest
UVob8FMT6Rk,4715120,4722080,every republican running for governor  has endorsed that law  and my current legislature has already
UVob8FMT6Rk,4722080,4729199,introduced bills to criminalize doctors  and nurses and put them in jail for 10  years i mean this is how how high the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4729199,4735440,stakes are right here in this important  battleground state and i've got i'm  going to continue to fight and veto
UVob8FMT6Rk,4735440,4740640,every effort to make it harder for women  but this is a very scary moment we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,4740640,4747360,been talking throughout the morning that  we all saw this coming certainly that  leaked draft opinion and and this hued
UVob8FMT6Rk,4747360,4753360,alongside it um what have you done  in michigan in anticipation of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,4753360,4758480,ruling  yeah so i filed a lawsuit a few months  ago and a lot of people said oh it's too
UVob8FMT6Rk,4758480,4764159,early or it's not ripe or it's you know  maybe this won't happen i'm glad that i  did
UVob8FMT6Rk,4764159,4769280,i am waiting for our supreme court to  take action we are anticipating that uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,4769280,4775040,we'll be having a briefing soon but time  is of the essence uh we have we won an
UVob8FMT6Rk,4775040,4781920,injunction one of our allies won an  injunction so the 1931 law is not in  effect at this moment women still have
UVob8FMT6Rk,4781920,4788320,the same rights we had yesterday but it  is precarious it is on appeal and that's  why i'm hoping the supreme court will
UVob8FMT6Rk,4788320,4794159,take my lawsuit up asap do you think  this changes the equation of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,4794159,4801360,midterms as we march toward november  you know what i know that 70 percent of  people in michigan support a woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,4801360,4808400,having the right to make her own  decision regardless of how they feel  individually supporting that right for
UVob8FMT6Rk,4808400,4814719,women and so i do think that this is  something that will bring a lot of  people out and a lot of people will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,4814719,4819760,very upset and angry about the state of  jurisprudence in our nation and roll
UVob8FMT6Rk,4819760,4826159,back of women's rights so i anticipate  that a lot of people will be activated  by this governor good to see you thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,4826159,4832159,you for taking the time for us  thank you joining us now is nbc news  political director and meet the press
UVob8FMT6Rk,4832159,4838159,moderator chuck todd and i'll just uh  ask you to see the same question i asked  the governor there is is this going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,4838159,4843440,change the equation of the midterms  democrats would clearly like it too  but what's the likelihood of that
UVob8FMT6Rk,4843440,4848880,happening i think it really is state  dependent and i say this and i and i and  meaning you know let me give you an
UVob8FMT6Rk,4848880,4854080,example nevada is one of the big  battleground states in 2022. uh abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,4854080,4860800,rights is enshrined in that state  constitution  the republican nominee for the senate  has already talked about hey it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,4860800,4868719,enshrined in the constitution no debate  here i'm not saying you won't see nevada  democrats want to you know fire up uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,4868719,4875120,democrats on the issue of abortion  but it is go you're going to hear you  know it is not it is not at risk in
UVob8FMT6Rk,4875120,4882480,nevada  but michigan and wisconsin it is going  to be front and center particularly in
UVob8FMT6Rk,4882480,4888719,in in the governor's races in both of  those places because of those trigger  laws and it really so the political
UVob8FMT6Rk,4888719,4895120,fallout to this look i think  it's certainly going to  uh help the democrats find a way to sort
UVob8FMT6Rk,4895120,4900719,of  uh to fire up the democratic base and  fire up people on this issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,4900719,4906880,sort of it what i would say is it's not  going to level the enthusiasm playing  field the rights fired up right now
UVob8FMT6Rk,4906880,4912080,believing they have a chance at winning  a  control of congress pushing back against
UVob8FMT6Rk,4912080,4917199,buying the economy the economic the  shaky economy that we're in right now  with inflation they certainly have those
UVob8FMT6Rk,4917199,4923760,advantages but i think this level this  is a beginning of a leveling of the  playing field if you will politically on
UVob8FMT6Rk,4923760,4929679,the activism front and on the enthusiasm  front but again i think it is more acute
UVob8FMT6Rk,4929679,4937199,in places like michigan and wisconsin  and here's another thing lester to think  about  you know so for the longest time
UVob8FMT6Rk,4937199,4943920,politicians elected officials have been  able to duck specifics  on the abortion issue they've simply
UVob8FMT6Rk,4943920,4950639,said i'm for roe or i'm against toro  if anything it would be the democrats  that would get sort of wedged well what
UVob8FMT6Rk,4950639,4955920,about late term abortions is it 20 weeks  is it 24 weeks but there was there was  not a debate
UVob8FMT6Rk,4955920,4962719,on that front and the republicans didn't  have to  think about those nuances well now sort  of the roles are going to be reversed
UVob8FMT6Rk,4962719,4970000,and  every candidate for every elective  office for a legislative body is going  to have to get specific okay
UVob8FMT6Rk,4970000,4977520,what are you open to and  that's where i think you're going to see  probably more divides on the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,4977520,4983120,than on the left and you're going to see  a lot of look what we've seen with the  gun debate john cornyn
UVob8FMT6Rk,4983120,4989520,you know tiptoed into gun regulations  and  the former president called him a rhino
UVob8FMT6Rk,4989520,4995600,if you're a elected republican and you  wanted roe overturned but you believe  there still should be access to abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,4995600,5002960,is that politically feasible in this  republican party today and those are the  type of potential wedging and political
UVob8FMT6Rk,5002960,5008880,fallout here i think the  the political consequences of this that  i think you will see play out i think
UVob8FMT6Rk,5008880,5016239,that republicans are not as unified at  banning all abortions  as the judiciary that the conservative
UVob8FMT6Rk,5016239,5023360,judges are pushing or even some of the  of the most hardcore sort of elected  state legislators are pushing
UVob8FMT6Rk,5023360,5029440,but are they gonna are they gonna sort  of run and hide on this and and are  those divides going to sort of roil
UVob8FMT6Rk,5029440,5035280,republican party politics in a way that  we haven't seen before so i i just think  that that's among the political
UVob8FMT6Rk,5035280,5041199,consequences look there's a lot of  consequences to that but just on the  political side of it that's what i'm  focused on yeah and and chuck we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,5041199,5047920,we've already heard some democrats  trying to to whip up folks with the idea  that it couldn't it may not stop here
UVob8FMT6Rk,5047920,5055600,that that gay marriage uh could be a  backup for another consideration now  justice alito tried to address that in
UVob8FMT6Rk,5055600,5060800,the opinion uh saying well those other  things don't involve a life but is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5060800,5066639,going to be a genuine fear and it is one  do you think that democrats will go to  try and animate the base oh i think
UVob8FMT6Rk,5066639,5074480,clarence thomas just handed them that  opportunity because in his concurring  opinion  he put griswold he put lawrence those
UVob8FMT6Rk,5074480,5080080,cases that enshrined right to  contraception and enshrined uh same-sex
UVob8FMT6Rk,5080080,5086560,marriage into  into law so the fact is it doesn't  matter what alito wrote thomas wrote
UVob8FMT6Rk,5086560,5092239,that and by the way in the bush the the  first time we saw this sort of in in  this century it was during the bush v
UVob8FMT6Rk,5092239,5098480,gore decision when the majority said  this should not be precedent and it  doesn't matter what you say pre you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,5098480,5106639,a ruling is precedent you could say it  shouldn't be but that's not up to you  um and so i i think it's a legitimate
UVob8FMT6Rk,5106639,5112719,um i think it's going to be a legitimate  fear that those in the left bring up  because again they don't they're not
UVob8FMT6Rk,5112719,5118960,making it up justice thomas wrote it in  his concurring opinion and so i think it  will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,5118960,5124239,and there will be some state  legislatures i believe idaho already had  some legislation in the works on
UVob8FMT6Rk,5124239,5129679,contraception so and and i think all  that is where i think this is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,5129679,5134960,roil  uh conservative primary politics in ways  that i don't think we fully appreciate
UVob8FMT6Rk,5134960,5140880,just yet all right chuck let me go back  to uh pete williams if i can pete's got  some more information for us
UVob8FMT6Rk,5140880,5146960,yes a couple of things lester first of  all on that question of the supreme  court decision today casting doubt on
UVob8FMT6Rk,5146960,5154719,other precedents like uh contraception  like same-sex marriage the dissenters  say today you know the the the majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,5154719,5160960,can't have it both ways either the logic  of their decision the dissenters say  this is the the opinion that the three
UVob8FMT6Rk,5160960,5166239,of them wrote together either the logic  is that a a a right has to be deeply
UVob8FMT6Rk,5166239,5171920,rooted in the tradition or the words of  their dissent don't worry this won't  count
UVob8FMT6Rk,5171920,5177600,it's one way or the other and if it's if  it's  they think they say this is hypocritical
UVob8FMT6Rk,5177600,5184800,the majority tells us not to worry they  say but either the of the opinion is  hypocrisy or additional constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,5184800,5191199,rights are under threat it can't be both  it's one or the other  also lester attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,5191199,5196800,merrick garland is out with a statement  today he says the justice department  strongly disagrees with the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,5196800,5201840,it's a long statement but i think the  key part of it is this he says women who
UVob8FMT6Rk,5201840,5207520,reside in states that have banned access  to comprehensive reproductive care must
UVob8FMT6Rk,5207520,5213199,remain free to seek care in states where  it's legal and he also says under first
UVob8FMT6Rk,5213199,5219679,amendment principles people must remain  free to inform and counsel each other  about the reproductive care that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,5219679,5226960,available in other states and indeed one  of the things that the dissenters say  here lester is there's there's nothing
UVob8FMT6Rk,5226960,5233280,in today's decision to prevent states  from doing that they worry that it's  something that states might do and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5233280,5239600,dissenters also say you know there's  nothing in today's decision while the  majority speaks of leaving this up to
UVob8FMT6Rk,5239600,5245840,the states and returning this issue to  the states that's sort of how justice  alito frames his decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,5245840,5252400,the dissent say there's nothing in this  decision that would prevent congress  from banning abortion nationwide lester
UVob8FMT6Rk,5252400,5258719,all right pete thank you i want to go  back to uh hallie jackson right now how  he's got more reaction to the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,5258719,5264080,yeah and this is coming in from former  president donald trump lester who in  many ways is central to the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,5264080,5270080,that we are seeing today because it was  of course the justices appointed under  his administration that he selected that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5270080,5276719,were confirmed during his time in office  that ultimately have proven to be the  deciding factors here in overturning roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,5276719,5282159,versus wade i want to be clear about  where we're getting this from this is  former president trump in an article
UVob8FMT6Rk,5282159,5289040,speaking apparently with fox news in an  article that fox news has posted online  so donald trump tells fox that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,5289040,5296000,decision is following the constitution  and giving rights back when they should  have been given long ago he says he goes
UVob8FMT6Rk,5296000,5301440,on to say this brings everything back to  the states where it has always belonged  and when asked whether he feels he
UVob8FMT6Rk,5301440,5307360,played a role in the reversal of roe  again given the backdrop that we just  laid out lester the justice is appointed
UVob8FMT6Rk,5307360,5314800,by him under his administration he said  god made the decision that's what he  told fox he also went on to say you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,5314800,5322080,what what his message would be to his  own supporters who are pro-choice keep  in mind that the former president has  hinted very strongly that he is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,5322080,5327199,run again in 2024 to try to recapture  the presidency so there obviously is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,5327199,5333360,political component to the way that he  is viewing this decision as well and so  when fox asked about what he would tell
UVob8FMT6Rk,5333360,5339280,his supporters who are pro-choice the  former president said this and i want to  quote it here he says i think in the end
UVob8FMT6Rk,5339280,5344480,this is something that will work out for  everybody  i think it's incredibly unclear what the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5344480,5350080,former president means by that because  this is a decision that carries the  weight of the supreme court lester the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5350080,5357520,highest court in the land that has now  effectively overturned roe and in in  half the states roughly you will see
UVob8FMT6Rk,5357520,5363760,abortions not become a legal procedure  for women who are seeking those  procedures they will have to travel that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5363760,5368960,is just the fact of the matter that it  is laid out in front of us right now as  we speak today lester so i think there's
UVob8FMT6Rk,5368960,5375679,there's more questions to answer on that  front too and to explore when you look  at the landscape of 2024 we've talked a
UVob8FMT6Rk,5375679,5381199,lot about the midterms and the way that  abortion rights and anti-abortion and  abortion access advocates are going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,5381199,5386320,be making this something that they hope  will motivate voters that goes twice
UVob8FMT6Rk,5386320,5392159,right for what we're going to see in  2024 in that presidential race lester  yeah and shock if you're you're with us
UVob8FMT6Rk,5392159,5399760,here um we don't lose sight of the fact  that this is a court that was shaped in  in tremendous ways by donald trump
UVob8FMT6Rk,5399760,5405840,oh and mitch mcconnell i mean you know  remember you could argue that two of the  three appointees that donald trump had
UVob8FMT6Rk,5405840,5410880,were sort of  done out of bounds right the first one
UVob8FMT6Rk,5410880,5416159,was a vacancy that occurred basically  with nearly a year left on barack  obama's term
UVob8FMT6Rk,5416159,5422159,and then you know  whatever precedent mitch mcconnell came  up with to to somehow say that that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5422159,5428880,couldn't be filled until after the  presidential election he didn't believe  it when the when ruth bader ginsburg  died essentially a month before
UVob8FMT6Rk,5428880,5434400,uh the 2020 election so you had this so  the you know i think there's a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,5434400,5442239,folks who feel as if  gorsuch and barrett two of the of the  five uh on this on this opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,5442239,5447600,were are sort of there unfairly or sort  of out of bounds now it's technically
UVob8FMT6Rk,5447600,5454239,was done um within the bounds of the  constitution but was it ethical how it  was done was it sort of you know and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,5454239,5459920,think that that's what's going to  why there is  i think such
UVob8FMT6Rk,5459920,5466880,anger more anger than normal but i'll  tell you it is donald trump's legacy and  i find his discomfort with his legacy on
UVob8FMT6Rk,5466880,5473280,this to be fascinating i mean he never  he really is sort of new to this he's  been on both sides of this issue when he
UVob8FMT6Rk,5473280,5478639,was a politician when he tried to enter  the political arena in the late 90s  early 2000s he'd talk about how
UVob8FMT6Rk,5478639,5485040,pro-choice he was  um and you know and then all of a sudden  he had to adopt this pro-life language
UVob8FMT6Rk,5485040,5491040,political language wasn't very good at  it there's a famous exchange he had with  our former uh uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,5491040,5496960,colleague chris matthews  where he started talking about okay if  you're going to criminalize it then and
UVob8FMT6Rk,5496960,5502320,he said you know you may have to you may  have to charge the woman who has the  abortion and then of course he ends up
UVob8FMT6Rk,5502320,5508880,having to walk that back but it was a  reminder that he's just unfamiliar he  never was really
UVob8FMT6Rk,5508880,5514639,deeply  informed  or passionate on the life side of things
UVob8FMT6Rk,5514639,5520639,and that reaction that sort of word  salad reaction that he's had on all this  i think tells you
UVob8FMT6Rk,5520639,5526400,he's likely very uncomfortable with this  but he doesn't know how to communicate  it you and i both know donald trump very  well
UVob8FMT6Rk,5526400,5532159,if if he thought  there's a part of me that's  the fact that he's not spiking the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5532159,5538719,football hey i'm the one who overturned  roe  tells you how uncomfortable he is  because he likes to spike the football
UVob8FMT6Rk,5538719,5545040,and take a lot of credit for things um  when they're done by people he's  appointed and he's not on this one which
UVob8FMT6Rk,5545040,5551840,i think tells you how uncomfortable and  really that this was not what he wanted  to do  on that front interesting thought uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,5551840,5557440,yamiche alcindor still with us yamiche  we hear the term all the time elections  have consequences can damage will
UVob8FMT6Rk,5557440,5563199,democrats run with that though to really  try and excite their voters
UVob8FMT6Rk,5563199,5568800,certainly democrats will be saying  to voters abortion is the thing to have
UVob8FMT6Rk,5568800,5575520,on the top of your mind when you think  about how rights can be taken away from  you and why elections have consequences
UVob8FMT6Rk,5575520,5580560,former president trump made the case  that he could be the republican nominee
UVob8FMT6Rk,5580560,5586080,and that he would carry the torch of  republican goals into the white house  and into the supreme court and that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,5586080,5591280,how he got to be president of the united  states with a lot of evangelicals in  particular telling me at the time that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5591280,5598159,they were very very worried about former  president trump and now you see him sort  of as chuck just said clumsily somewhat
UVob8FMT6Rk,5598159,5603840,taking credit for this but it is a  credit that he has to take because he  was the one who delivered this
UVob8FMT6Rk,5603840,5610159,generational goal to conservatives a  culmination of so much work um i will  also just say that democrats of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,5610159,5615840,will be making the case in the midterms  for sure that they're that their  candidates need to be elected in order
UVob8FMT6Rk,5615840,5622960,to reverse this yamiche thank you very  much  i want to let our viewers know some of  you will be leaving us here to join your
UVob8FMT6Rk,5622960,5629960,midday local news others will continue  the coverage here on nbc news
UVob8FMT6Rk,5637440,5643600,it is noon here on the east coast if you  were just joining us let me recap the  extraordinary events of this historic
UVob8FMT6Rk,5643600,5649520,day just about two hours ago the u.s  supreme court overturned roe v wade a
UVob8FMT6Rk,5649520,5654639,woman's right to abortion the decision  comes after almost 50 years and will
UVob8FMT6Rk,5654639,5659920,lead to near total bans on the procedure  in about half the states the majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,5659920,5665600,conservative supreme court overturned  roe in a 5-4 vote it is a victory for
UVob8FMT6Rk,5665600,5670639,abortion opponents many celebrating  outside the court at this hour but it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,5670639,5676320,not a total surprise to supporters of  abortion rights  they have been bracing for the loss
UVob8FMT6Rk,5676320,5683040,after an early draft of the opinion was  leaked back in may they call it an  assault on reproductive freedoms of
UVob8FMT6Rk,5683040,5688239,women the ruling came in a dispute over  a law passed in mississippi's root by
UVob8FMT6Rk,5688239,5694080,mississippi mississippi's  republican-controlled legislature to ban  abortions after 15 weeks and in just
UVob8FMT6Rk,5694080,5699520,about a half hour we expect a briefing  or comments from president biden about
UVob8FMT6Rk,5699520,5706000,today's decision we will carry that of  course let's go right to nbc justice  correspondent pete williams pete
UVob8FMT6Rk,5706000,5712639,i said it a moment ago notably 5-4 the  vote here  5-4 on the key question of overturning
UVob8FMT6Rk,5712639,5719679,roe and the follow-on decision called  planned parenthood v casey that said  that states cannot ban abortion before
UVob8FMT6Rk,5719679,5724880,viability that's roughly 23 weeks into  the pregnancy so that is gone and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5724880,5731280,court did that in upholding by a vote of  six to three the law that was that  brought this issue to the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,5731280,5738080,mississippi's law that would ban  abortion after 15 weeks so it's it's the  court upheld that law and by a five to
UVob8FMT6Rk,5738080,5743920,four vote overturned roe v wade so this  doesn't make abortion illegal nationwide
UVob8FMT6Rk,5743920,5748960,it simply removes and i say simply it  removes the constitutional protection
UVob8FMT6Rk,5748960,5754960,for abortion there's no longer a  constitutional right to abortion  according to the supreme court this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,5754960,5761520,the first time in history that the  supreme court has ever granted a right  that is widely recognized and then taken
UVob8FMT6Rk,5761520,5766719,away it's it's technically speaking not  the first time the court has ever  granted a right and taken it away but
UVob8FMT6Rk,5766719,5772880,it's the first time it's ever done that  for a right that had widespread public  support and was widely recognized so
UVob8FMT6Rk,5772880,5778239,it's now up to the states to decide  whether to make abortion illegal and by
UVob8FMT6Rk,5778239,5785679,our count roughly half the states will  do so 13 of those states already have  laws on the book so-called trigger laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,5785679,5791040,that make abortion illegal if the court  ever worded to overturn roe and casey
UVob8FMT6Rk,5791040,5797360,missouri is already the first of the  states to to take that action as of  today the attorney general of missouri
UVob8FMT6Rk,5797360,5804159,says abortion is now illegal in that  state the majority opinion was written  by justice samuel alito it closely
UVob8FMT6Rk,5804159,5811760,tracks with the leaked opinion that came  out in may that was actually drafted in  february that said roe was egregiously
UVob8FMT6Rk,5811760,5819199,wrong that there is no constitutional  right to abortion in the constitution  and the only way a constitutional right
UVob8FMT6Rk,5819199,5824320,can be derived from the constitution's  14th amendment if it is if it is deeply
UVob8FMT6Rk,5824320,5830239,rooted in the nation's history and  traditions and part of the concept of  ordered liberty roe flunks that test the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5830239,5836719,court said there is no requirement in  the supreme court's decision today for  states to make an exception in their
UVob8FMT6Rk,5836719,5842400,laws banning abortion for rape and  incest it doesn't say they have to it  doesn't say they can't but the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5842400,5849840,dissenters point out today that that is  a big problem with the majority opinion  justice kavanaugh says he believes in
UVob8FMT6Rk,5849840,5857440,joining the majority that the states  cannot restrict travel now that's only  his opinion but because he's one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,5857440,5865360,five without him it'd only be four it  wouldn't be a majority so that opinion  has controlling force so by justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,5865360,5871119,kavanaugh's logic states cannot restrict  travel they cannot make it illegal for
UVob8FMT6Rk,5871119,5877520,women to go from a state that bans  abortion to a state that doesn't in  order to receive the care
UVob8FMT6Rk,5877520,5884560,that's a point that attorney general  merrick garland has made in a statement  he says state shouldn't be able to do  that and he also says under the first
UVob8FMT6Rk,5884560,5891040,amendment people should be free to get  counsel about reproductive care that's  available in other states that shouldn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,5891040,5899119,be illegal the dissenters justice  stephen breyer sonya sotomayor and elena  kagan filed a long and impassioned joint
UVob8FMT6Rk,5899119,5904480,descent let me just summarize what they  say they say the supreme court says that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5904480,5909920,from the very moment of fertilization a  woman has no rights to speak of a state
UVob8FMT6Rk,5909920,5915280,can force her to bring a pregnancy to  term even at the steepest personal and
UVob8FMT6Rk,5915280,5921760,familial cost lester all right pete  williams thank you very much we have  from the very beginning of the morning
UVob8FMT6Rk,5921760,5927119,when the decision was announced we've  watched that crowd  outside the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,5927119,5932639,passionate  protesters on both sides of this issue  let's bring in nbc's maura barrett who
UVob8FMT6Rk,5932639,5938080,is in the crowds  maura  lester when you talk about passionate
UVob8FMT6Rk,5938080,5943760,protesters we're seeing some of the  tension actually right behind me where  two groups of protesters uh some that
UVob8FMT6Rk,5943760,5949600,are that support the right to an  abortion some that are against it just  wrapped up a pretty heated argument and
UVob8FMT6Rk,5949600,5956320,that's something that we had seen  throughout the week here as we expected  the decision to come down as well as  this morning to the extent
UVob8FMT6Rk,5956320,5961600,that police had to get involved and  establish a peaceful protest line is  what they said that they were attempting
UVob8FMT6Rk,5961600,5969119,to do but right when the decision came  down a few minute at 10 10 a.m eastern  time there was a group of people who
UVob8FMT6Rk,5969119,5975040,were overjoyed jumping up and down uh  celebrating cheering and crying tears of
UVob8FMT6Rk,5975040,5981679,joy one woman telling me that she was  overjoyed and this was it was this  massive feeling of relief for her i
UVob8FMT6Rk,5981679,5987520,spoke with another young woman who  opposed the right to an abortion because  she has family members who have had
UVob8FMT6Rk,5987520,5992719,abortion she told me and then they  regretted it the rest of their lives and  so she wanted to make sure that babies
UVob8FMT6Rk,5992719,5998239,rights were protected as she told me and  so we did see the crowd balloon here in
UVob8FMT6Rk,5998239,6003280,the last couple of hours there was  probably about 100 or 150 or so  initially this morning and there are
UVob8FMT6Rk,6003280,6009360,just if hundreds if not um  a thousand or more here  right now you can see the people as my
UVob8FMT6Rk,6009360,6014960,photographer ronnie walks around here  they are largely people that did support  the right for an abortion we did see
UVob8FMT6Rk,6014960,6020960,hundreds of people younger people in red  the students for life group that  actually just left the area
UVob8FMT6Rk,6020960,6027760,and are  marching around the supreme court now  but i want you to hear directly from  michelle she is a protester that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,6027760,6033360,just standing here and i want you to say  hello she um  she has when i came up and said hello to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6033360,6039679,her she was wearing a piece of tape over  her mouth that said second class citizen  and i saw a group of you put those on
UVob8FMT6Rk,6039679,6045600,shortly after the decision came down  what does this decision mean to you  today and were you surprised given that
UVob8FMT6Rk,6045600,6052000,the draft had leaked earlier this year  um we are not surprised we are still  concerned and very alarmed about this
UVob8FMT6Rk,6052000,6057119,decision as a non-christian  i see this as religious rule
UVob8FMT6Rk,6057119,6063199,and i see it as nothing more than men  and religious organizations attempting  to control women's bodies
UVob8FMT6Rk,6063199,6068639,and tell me a little bit i mean how are  you feeling do you have hope for  progress moving forward what are you
UVob8FMT6Rk,6068639,6075360,looking to see  in the country now  um yeah there's always hope  i think our best bet is legislatively
UVob8FMT6Rk,6075360,6082000,but unfortunately people are going to  die women are going to die between now  and when we can get legislation passed
UVob8FMT6Rk,6082000,6087440,which is  untenable and  i don't know how we've let it get to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6087440,6093440,this point  it's just very  disappointing thank you so much for for
UVob8FMT6Rk,6093440,6099679,sharing your thoughts and to michelle's  point there talking about women dying  that's a repeated thing i've heard
UVob8FMT6Rk,6099679,6106080,from people here who had strongly  supported the right to an abortion i  just met this woman hannah who is 66
UVob8FMT6Rk,6106080,6112159,years old she said she was in high  school when when roe v wade initially  passed and prior to that she had heard
UVob8FMT6Rk,6112159,6118239,stories in her home state of washington  where girls had disappeared looking to  get abortion stories of knitting needles
UVob8FMT6Rk,6118239,6124320,some very graphic stories and she was  she expressed such disappointment and  knowing that the country in her mind
UVob8FMT6Rk,6124320,6129760,could be going back to that and she also  elaborated saying that she hopes that if  anything this is what drives people to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6129760,6135360,vote in the midterms come november  lester all right mora thanks watching  those crowds outside the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,6135360,6141600,let's go to our chief white house  correspondent peter alexander peter we  should be hearing from the president  very shortly here yeah that's right we
UVob8FMT6Rk,6141600,6147679,expect to hear from him about 20 minutes  from now at 12 30 in the cross hall  inside the white house residents when
UVob8FMT6Rk,6147679,6152960,we're done with this conversation i'm  gonna head inside in anticipation the  president may take reporters questions
UVob8FMT6Rk,6152960,6159199,but i have to tell you i've been inside  the west wing at points over the day and  for a lot of members of this white house
UVob8FMT6Rk,6159199,6165360,staff this was a gun punch in many ways  they anticipated this ruling though they  didn't think it would come as early as
UVob8FMT6Rk,6165360,6172159,today but in the words of 1a they  described it as a heavy day and a  devastating decision we've yet to hear
UVob8FMT6Rk,6172159,6177520,from president biden though we will hear  from him shortly but top democrats have  already described this in the words of
UVob8FMT6Rk,6177520,6184560,chuck schumer as being one of the  darkest days in our country's uh history  nancy pelosi describing this ruling as a
UVob8FMT6Rk,6184560,6190560,slap in the face to women in this  country so just gives you a little bit  of a sense of where they are on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,6190560,6198159,there's been a lot of pressure on the  president from abortion rights advocates  to announce plans what he can do through
UVob8FMT6Rk,6198159,6203360,executive actions to help try to expand  access to reproductive health care right
UVob8FMT6Rk,6203360,6208880,now his ability is certainly limited but  we are told by a senior administration  official that the president
UVob8FMT6Rk,6208880,6214880,will lay out what if any plans the  administration has in place right now  just a short time ago though we haven't
UVob8FMT6Rk,6214880,6221600,heard from the president we did hear  from his attorney general merrick  garland who released a statement that  said the justice department strongly
UVob8FMT6Rk,6221600,6227679,disagrees with the court's decision few  rights are more central to individual  freedom than the right to control one's
UVob8FMT6Rk,6227679,6235600,own body and he adds the justice  department will use every tool at our  disposal to protect reproductive freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,6235600,6241360,among the desires of those abortion  rights advocates are that the president  perhaps would expand access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6241360,6247679,reproductive health care on federal  lands that the federal government  controls and beyond that
UVob8FMT6Rk,6247679,6253440,the president may have additional  announcements as it relates to  increasing access to abortion medication
UVob8FMT6Rk,6253440,6259199,abortion pills right now a majority of  the abortions in this country  are
UVob8FMT6Rk,6259199,6265520,are done with abortion medication and  there's new reporting that also  indicates that nearly one in four women
UVob8FMT6Rk,6265520,6272639,in this country by the age of 45 will  have had an abortion you've seen the  public polling lester right now about 60
UVob8FMT6Rk,6272639,6279840,percent of americans according to the  most recent nbc news poll believe that  abortion should be legal or mostly legal
UVob8FMT6Rk,6279840,6287040,about 37 percent say that abortion  should be illegal either with exceptions  or without exceptions and one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6287040,6292719,biggest concerns for the white house  right now is as it relates to those who  are most likely to be most impacted by
UVob8FMT6Rk,6292719,6298000,this  that is people who are poor low income  individuals individuals from minority
UVob8FMT6Rk,6298000,6303440,communities specifically right now even  before the roe v wade ruling today in
UVob8FMT6Rk,6303440,6309040,parts of the south and the midwest  access to an abortion was already a
UVob8FMT6Rk,6309040,6315520,struggle for many of those individuals  who had limited access to clinics and  due to restrictions that existed in many
UVob8FMT6Rk,6315520,6322400,of those places including and sometimes  from insurance coverage and beyond so we  anticipate that the president will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,6322400,6328480,laying out  in some form what if anything he plans  to do here he'll be speaking on camera
UVob8FMT6Rk,6328480,6334960,again before he heads overseas to europe  i'm told that his remarks for today had  been pre-prepared although senior staff
UVob8FMT6Rk,6334960,6340080,i'm told was meeting with him in the  white house oval office just a matter of  moments ago to make any last-minute
UVob8FMT6Rk,6340080,6347040,changes but they certainly did  anticipate that this ruling was in the  pipeline lester all right peter  alexander we're about 20 minutes away
UVob8FMT6Rk,6347040,6352080,now from the president's scheduled  remarks on all this in the meantime  let's go to congressional correspondent
UVob8FMT6Rk,6352080,6358719,ali vitale who's on capitol hill ali you  could argue that uh the roads now lead  through the capitalists to next steps
UVob8FMT6Rk,6358719,6365199,and what happens in all this what are  you hearing  well the roads would lead through the  capital on this lester only democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,6365199,6372320,tried and previously failed to pass a  bill that would have codified federal  protections for abortion access they did
UVob8FMT6Rk,6372320,6378320,that right after that leaked supreme  court draft decision they've known that  this was coming it's why we see senate
UVob8FMT6Rk,6378320,6383920,democrats demanding president biden take  several specific executive actions peter
UVob8FMT6Rk,6383920,6390480,was laying out some of them things like  shoring up access to the abortion pill  trying to crack down on data brokers who
UVob8FMT6Rk,6390480,6397199,might be selling information of people  as they go to abortion clinics also  making sure that there are resources
UVob8FMT6Rk,6397199,6404239,available to women and people who want  to access abortion care if they have to  travel out of state to do it but frankly
UVob8FMT6Rk,6404239,6410719,the federal government piece of this is  hamstrung in terms of their ability to  act right now it's why the lawmakers
UVob8FMT6Rk,6410719,6416080,that i've been speaking to all turn  their eyes to the states  it's something that they're also pushing
UVob8FMT6Rk,6416080,6422400,ahead to the midterm elections and we've  seen this in our polling data the fact  that this was not a priority for
UVob8FMT6Rk,6422400,6427440,american voters because it's been  settled precedent for 49 years we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,6427440,6433679,seen though in recent weeks since that  leaked dressed opinion the fact that  this is becoming a bigger priority to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6433679,6439199,voters seeing upwards of 15 and 16 point  swings in terms of how important this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,6439199,6445520,going to be in the election coming up  and it's something that every single  lawmaker here has said to me the emotion
UVob8FMT6Rk,6445520,6451760,that peter is talking about  that he's seeing at the white house  right now i'm seeing that from lawmakers
UVob8FMT6Rk,6451760,6457520,and staffers who are here in the halls  of congress as i've been texting with  lawmakers today on the democratic side
UVob8FMT6Rk,6457520,6463840,of the aisle they are angry they are  enraged and they say that they are ready  to fight and what they mean by fight
UVob8FMT6Rk,6463840,6469440,again is not a legislative avenue  because they tried that and it has  failed instead they are going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6469440,6475520,continue trying to galvanize their  voters urging them to get out in the  states and vote because now this issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,6475520,6482159,that had long been theoretical is now  real a completely untested principle on  an issue that we have seen energize
UVob8FMT6Rk,6482159,6488560,voters for decades in theory and now  november is the moment that we actually  see it in practice lester it is real
UVob8FMT6Rk,6488560,6495199,indeed ali vitale thank you and joining  us uh now nbc news senior washington  correspondent hallie jackson who's been
UVob8FMT6Rk,6495199,6501920,monitoring reaction hallie  and some of this lester is about looking  ahead but it's also looking at the many
UVob8FMT6Rk,6501920,6508239,decades of this precedent of roe versus  wade having existed you look at the  dissent and there is a quote where they
UVob8FMT6Rk,6508239,6514320,write after today young women will come  of age with fewer rights than their  mothers and grandmothers had and that
UVob8FMT6Rk,6514320,6519600,speaks to the generational impact of  this decision so today we think it's  important to take a look not just at
UVob8FMT6Rk,6519600,6524360,what's next but how we got here
UVob8FMT6Rk,6525770,6532800,[Applause]  for 50 years it's been the flash point
UVob8FMT6Rk,6532800,6538639,at the center of american politics  when you have an abortion you're
UVob8FMT6Rk,6538639,6544560,murdering your own child we're not going  to be pushed back into a period of back  alley abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,6544560,6551840,and the case that loomed over every  supreme court nomination battle do you  expect to overrule the roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,6551840,6559280,supreme court decision i don't think it  would be  proper for me to answer that something  central to a woman's
UVob8FMT6Rk,6559280,6565920,life it's been reaffirmed many times all  supreme court cases are presidential
UVob8FMT6Rk,6565920,6571360,in 1970 a pregnant norma mccorvey known  as jane roe to protect her identity
UVob8FMT6Rk,6571360,6578159,filed a class-action suit against the  district attorney of dallas county texas  henry wade the suit took aim at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6578159,6584719,existing abortion ban in texas that only  allowed a pregnancy to be terminated to  save a woman's life the united states
UVob8FMT6Rk,6584719,6590719,supreme court it handed down a historic  decision about abortion in 1973 the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6590719,6598320,court ruled in roe's favor in a 7-2  decision the freedom to have an abortion  is now legal in every state declaring
UVob8FMT6Rk,6598320,6603840,abortion as a constitutional right  citing in part a personal right to  privacy
UVob8FMT6Rk,6603840,6609920,it stopped states from banning the  procedure before fetal viability the  point in a pregnancy when a fetus can
UVob8FMT6Rk,6609920,6617280,survive outside the womb  after the ruling the number of reported  abortions rose across the nation from 14
UVob8FMT6Rk,6617280,6623440,legal abortions per every thousand women  in 1973 to a high of 25 legal abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,6623440,6629840,per every thousand women in 1980  according to the cdc  the most recent reporting from 2019
UVob8FMT6Rk,6629840,6636960,shows more than 629 000 legal abortions  that year  roe v wade radically transformed the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6636960,6642719,political landscape  the two opposing sides in the abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,6642719,6648639,rights debate  growing into powerful political  movements
UVob8FMT6Rk,6648639,6655360,as recently as 2020 a gallup poll found  one in four americans considered  abortion to be a key voting issue the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6655360,6661920,topic playing a part in every major  presidential election of the last 40  years what single issue could say more
UVob8FMT6Rk,6661920,6667040,about a society's values this difficult  and painful decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,6667040,6673280,should be left to the women have a  god-given right  to life i support a woman's right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6673280,6679599,choose over the years the supreme court  approved restrictions that chipped away  at roe versus wade including limits on
UVob8FMT6Rk,6679599,6686880,abortion procedures for ultrasound exams  and counseling but the constitutional  right to abortion remained for nearly 50
UVob8FMT6Rk,6686880,6692480,years  that is of course until today and this  landmark decision now by the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,6692480,6698320,court as we take a look at the screen at  the number of protesters demonstrators  who have gathered outside the court on
UVob8FMT6Rk,6698320,6703760,frankly a day that is making history a  day that has already gone down in  history that's how we got here what you
UVob8FMT6Rk,6703760,6708800,just heard over the last couple of  minutes so when you look at what's next  the immediate impact is going to happen
UVob8FMT6Rk,6708800,6714719,on the state level 13 states we've  talked about this they have trigger laws  in place that would basically outright
UVob8FMT6Rk,6714719,6721760,ban abortion some of the states do have  exceptions for for example rape and  incest some do not you also have 10
UVob8FMT6Rk,6721760,6728080,other states that would not outright ban  abortion but would severely restrict it  for example preventing any abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,6728080,6734400,procedures from let's say six weeks to  20 weeks both of which are below the  line of what's considered fetal
UVob8FMT6Rk,6734400,6740480,viability generally thought to be around  24 weeks when a fetus could survive  outside the womb that is the immediate
UVob8FMT6Rk,6740480,6746320,landscape that we are looking at here at  the end of june as we then look ahead to  the political impact too leading up to
UVob8FMT6Rk,6746320,6752880,not just the november midterms but to  2024 as well a majority of americans did  not want to see roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,6752880,6758400,overturned 63 percent did not 30 percent  thought that it should be so roughly a
UVob8FMT6Rk,6758400,6764719,third of america based on this nbc news  polling from just last month believes  that this was the right decision by the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6764719,6771199,court  and frankly they are celebrating today  for others particularly democrats that  we've heard from here during the special
UVob8FMT6Rk,6771199,6778000,report as i've been talking to folks as  well  they are feeling i think very  demoralized on the political component
UVob8FMT6Rk,6778000,6783040,too you know i was just texting with  somebody a contact of mine in south  carolina a critical state as we look
UVob8FMT6Rk,6783040,6788719,ahead to 2024 particularly on the  republican side and they are framing it  to me is now
UVob8FMT6Rk,6788719,6795840,from a politics perspective  this going to catalyze conservative  versus even further right where are
UVob8FMT6Rk,6795840,6803360,republican candidates particularly when  you look at the presidential election on  that spectrum  of limiting abortion access how far do
UVob8FMT6Rk,6803360,6809119,some of those candidates go and i think  that's a point worth thinking about as  we move forward lester all right hallie  thanks for walking us through all that
UVob8FMT6Rk,6809119,6815280,uh jennifer mascot is an assistant law  professor at george mason university she  clerked for both clarence thomas and
UVob8FMT6Rk,6815280,6822400,brett kavanaugh  for kavanaugh it was at the circuit  level i want to thank you for joining us  uh your uh your insight is uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,6822400,6829280,extraordinarily valuable right now can  you talk about  uh  how justice alito arrived at this
UVob8FMT6Rk,6829280,6835679,decision and and the theory that  you know his guiding guiding force here
UVob8FMT6Rk,6835679,6842320,absolutely um and thanks for thanks for  having me on i think it's important to  note that for 185 years um after the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6842320,6848080,founding of this country the court had  not weighed in uh on abortion and so of  course it did and roe versus wade and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,6848080,6854800,think what justice alito's opinion does  today is look back at the text and  structure of the constitution at history
UVob8FMT6Rk,6854800,6860000,and note that abortion really was not  addressed in the text of the  constitution and what the court did
UVob8FMT6Rk,6860000,6865040,today the majority of the justices i  think most fundamentally is acknowledge
UVob8FMT6Rk,6865040,6870080,that it is not going to take a  one-size-fits-all approach to uh  deciding this issue for the american
UVob8FMT6Rk,6870080,6877599,people any longer it's taken itself out  of the seat of power and in recognizing  that this is an issue uh that people
UVob8FMT6Rk,6877599,6883760,have strong views on both sides and so  it's something that's left up to states  local representatives the people
UVob8FMT6Rk,6883760,6889920,themselves to reach decisions on um of  course the roe versus way decision  itself in its justification has been
UVob8FMT6Rk,6889920,6896000,changed a number of times by the court  over the years and has been criticized  for many years and so i think the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,6896000,6901679,also looked and and at the traditional  factors that it examines when it looks  at precedent and said this was a
UVob8FMT6Rk,6901679,6906960,decision that was sort of suspect from  the beginning  and as we can see from the protest today
UVob8FMT6Rk,6906960,6913520,and some of the threats and the leak  itself when the supreme court a few  several decades ago took for itself the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6913520,6918880,the role of deciding some of these  issues for the american people it's led  to a lot of politicization of the body
UVob8FMT6Rk,6918880,6924000,and so i think today's decision really  restores the rule of law and again
UVob8FMT6Rk,6924000,6930320,makes the court again a neutral body um  looking just at the text and structure  of the constitution and properly leaving
UVob8FMT6Rk,6930320,6938080,really tough issues to the american  people let me ask you about the door  that has been left open regardless of  what justice alito said that door being
UVob8FMT6Rk,6938080,6944960,there are other rights that have been  granted that that could be  reviewed and overturned here how real do
UVob8FMT6Rk,6944960,6950159,you think that threat is  not not real i mean justice kavanaugh
UVob8FMT6Rk,6950159,6955679,addresses this in his separate opinion  which as commentators have noted already  on the network this morning his was one
UVob8FMT6Rk,6955679,6961520,of five votes um required for the  opinion but i think it just states the  obvious point that of course the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6961520,6967440,particular issue before the court today  was the question of abortion uh the  court's opinion with justice alito
UVob8FMT6Rk,6967440,6973040,writing talks about the very um critical  aspect of the other right at play here
UVob8FMT6Rk,6973040,6978719,the right of the fetus and to the  balancing of of interest here of course  as a practical matter people would have
UVob8FMT6Rk,6978719,6985760,to tee up litigation to raise the other  issues but i think also justice alito's  extensive discussion of starry decisis
UVob8FMT6Rk,6985760,6992320,is something that would need to be  contended with in future decisions so of  course justice thomas notes in his  separate opinion that just on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,6992320,6998400,constitutional reasoning alone of test  of text and precedent of course there  are many other decisions of the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,6998400,7004000,recently that might be questioned under  those standards and that's the door
UVob8FMT6Rk,7004000,7009360,yeah but as far as the will to challenge  it and then again justice leaders  opinion seems to me quite clear that roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,7009360,7016560,was a particularly egregious case under  precedent and so i find it  extremely unlikely that any time uh in
UVob8FMT6Rk,7016560,7022480,the foreseeable future some of the other  uh issues would be would be challenged  and in fact some of the justices and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7022480,7027679,folks themselves in particular some of  the more far-flung  questions about contraception i think
UVob8FMT6Rk,7027679,7033840,there's no will and in fact many many of  the justices perhaps who joined the  majority opinion today would actually
UVob8FMT6Rk,7033840,7039840,not come down the same way on some of  those other cases so i think  yeah jennifer those those things are
UVob8FMT6Rk,7039840,7044880,going to stay in place for now yeah  thank you for for being with us and  sharing your insight we appreciate it
UVob8FMT6Rk,7044880,7051520,nancy northup is the president and ceo  of the center for reproductive rights  the center argued this case at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7051520,7057440,supreme court on behalf of the  mississippi abortion clinic i thank you  for being with us
UVob8FMT6Rk,7057440,7063040,obviously the decision we we see today  is mirrors what we saw in that draft uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,7063040,7070320,back in may so clearly you were prepared  for this moment  well it's devastating nonetheless
UVob8FMT6Rk,7070320,7075360,i mean the court in its decision today  turned its back on the rule of law it
UVob8FMT6Rk,7075360,7081040,turned its back  on women it has set back women's rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,7081040,7086480,for more than 50 years  and it's taken away a personal liberty  and it's the first time the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,7086480,7093840,court has ever done that so the  consequences of today's decision are  going to be swift and devastating and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7093840,7100239,we're going to see utter chaos in the  days and weeks ahead and there is this  sense of mobilization of not laying down
UVob8FMT6Rk,7100239,7108159,of fighting going forward but for the  for the time being  uh what happens in the in the fight for
UVob8FMT6Rk,7108159,7113840,abortion rights  well i think you're going to see  incredible mobilization i mean today  you're going to see people coming out
UVob8FMT6Rk,7113840,7118960,across the country i think you're going  to continue to see that for those of us  who work on law and policy this is not
UVob8FMT6Rk,7118960,7124080,the end of the story there are three  branches of government so we'll be  looking both to the congress the women's
UVob8FMT6Rk,7124080,7129840,health protection act congress can fix  this we'll be looking to the  administration to do what it can within
UVob8FMT6Rk,7129840,7135360,its powers to  preserve access to abortion care and  we'll be looking to the states every
UVob8FMT6Rk,7135360,7142320,state has its own constitution and its  own laws and can protect access and we  have litigation going on right now on
UVob8FMT6Rk,7142320,7148159,state constitutional protections for  abortion rights and we'll also be  seeking to not let those trigger laws go
UVob8FMT6Rk,7148159,7155040,into effect which purport to be able to  have roe versus you know with roe versus  wade's overturning to have abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,7155040,7160960,immediately banned we'll be looking to  every single legal lever to stop this  horrific
UVob8FMT6Rk,7160960,7166639,uh situation from going into impact  nancy my colleague chuck todd has a  question for you nancy i want to follow
UVob8FMT6Rk,7166639,7172880,up on that let's get specific here there  are two i know some a couple of actions  that that some folks are looking to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7172880,7180239,biden administration that they think is  possible  are within his power one is figuring out  a way to the the so-called abortion pill
UVob8FMT6Rk,7180239,7186080,making sure that that's available  uh widely what kind of administrative
UVob8FMT6Rk,7186080,7191119,um what what do you need from the  administration to guarantee that and the  other thing was something the attorney
UVob8FMT6Rk,7191119,7198560,general said in his statement which is  he wants to make sure that first  amendment rights aren't being uh aren't
UVob8FMT6Rk,7198560,7203760,being  blocked when it comes to informing  people that they can travel out of state
UVob8FMT6Rk,7203760,7210080,to get an abortion and they can do this  what specifically do you need to see  from the biden administration in an
UVob8FMT6Rk,7210080,7216320,executive order action here that could  that could guarantee that in the short  term
UVob8FMT6Rk,7216320,7222880,well i think that what is going to be a  reality because we're going to see in  bath swap bath swash of the south and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7222880,7229040,the midwest abortion become illegal is  that we're going to have a public health  emergency and i think the buying
UVob8FMT6Rk,7229040,7234400,administration can look to its powers  under a public health emergency to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,7234400,7240480,able to get medication abortion to be  prescribed to people in those states it
UVob8FMT6Rk,7240480,7246159,is known the effects and the health  effects and the burdens of when abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,7246159,7252080,is criminalized we see that around the  world we see it in history and so we are  going to have a public health crisis and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7252080,7258000,we're going to need to have medication  abortion be able to be delivered to  people in those states so i think that
UVob8FMT6Rk,7258000,7265760,is one of the things to be looking at  quite strongly and as you point out  people are also going to have to travel  to other states and those states are
UVob8FMT6Rk,7265760,7272239,getting ready to be able to have people  come to the states and they want to make  sure that you know they are supportive
UVob8FMT6Rk,7272239,7278880,of abortion rights as essential health  care in their states and are not going  to want to see the doctors in those  their states providing care
UVob8FMT6Rk,7278880,7285119,to be somehow caught up in the attempt  by other states to stop people from  leaving what are the next battle lines
UVob8FMT6Rk,7285119,7290400,in this as far as you're concerned we  look you know people are questioning  about contraceptives uh where do you
UVob8FMT6Rk,7290400,7295520,think you'll be putting up your defenses  well i think we have to look to you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,7295520,7302880,the supreme court has protected these  fundamental decisions about our personal  liberty this is the realm of the home
UVob8FMT6Rk,7302880,7309040,contraception when and whether to have  children who we marry all of this has  been protected as a fundamental personal
UVob8FMT6Rk,7309040,7314400,liberty under the 14th amendment the  supreme court just kicked out a key
UVob8FMT6Rk,7314400,7319679,decision from 50 years ago which many  other decisions have been built upon and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7319679,7326080,the notion that it can't destroy the  constitutional fabric for these  decisions is just not correct and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,7326080,7332080,we're of course going to be looking to  re-establish what all of us in this  country believe which is that these are
UVob8FMT6Rk,7332080,7338400,intensely personal decisions that in a  free society people want to make from  themselves who they marry when and
UVob8FMT6Rk,7338400,7343920,whether to have children these are  personal decisions for us to decide in a  free country nancy northam we appreciate
UVob8FMT6Rk,7343920,7349280,your time thank you for joining us let  me go back to justice correspondent pete  williams pete walk me through the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7349280,7355520,mechanics so that the ruling has come  down does everything change immediately  we talked about these trigger laws in
UVob8FMT6Rk,7355520,7360639,some states is this happening right now  it is happening right now and in some
UVob8FMT6Rk,7360639,7366880,states it is immediate and according to  the either the attorney general's or the  governors of four states
UVob8FMT6Rk,7366880,7373920,abortion is now illegal in missouri  south dakota louisiana and kentucky
UVob8FMT6Rk,7373920,7380400,the three of them south dakota louisiana  and kentucky were so-called trigger loss  states missouri recently just changed
UVob8FMT6Rk,7380400,7385440,its law so now those four states and its  abortion is illegal in those in some of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7385440,7391360,the other states this happens in a in a  series of rollouts so for example in uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,7391360,7398560,in 10 days abortion will become illegal  in mississippi now that roe has been  decided in another 30 days in texas
UVob8FMT6Rk,7398560,7405679,idaho and tennessee and then in the rest  of the 13 trigger law states it will  become illegal and we think lester that
UVob8FMT6Rk,7405679,7412960,eventually within the next several  months abortion will be illegal in  roughly half the country in 24 states it
UVob8FMT6Rk,7412960,7419599,will remain legal in the other states  and as you just mentioned some of the  questions now to be resolved are will
UVob8FMT6Rk,7419599,7426080,states try to criminalize traveling  going from one state to another  as i read the supreme court decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,7426080,7431280,today justice kavanaugh's concurrence  which is controlling is he says states
UVob8FMT6Rk,7431280,7436719,cannot constitutionally make that a  crime they can't ban people who live in
UVob8FMT6Rk,7436719,7441840,non-abortion states from going to states  where the procedure is available
UVob8FMT6Rk,7441840,7447599,and then the question is what about  getting counseling uh what about getting  counseling in your state is that going
UVob8FMT6Rk,7447599,7452800,to be considered a crime so there there  are lots of legal questions yet to be  resolved but you're right it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,7452800,7459520,happening immediately and it's going to  roll out here over the next uh several  weeks all right uh pete thanks it's uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,7459520,7465440,12 30 in the east right now this is the  time that we are expecting the president  to come out make remarks in front of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7465440,7472639,camera uh 12 30 the scheduled time  obviously not quite there yet but  there's the setup reporter standing by
UVob8FMT6Rk,7472639,7478719,hopefully able to ask the president some  questions so we will go back there  as soon as he gets underway meantime
UVob8FMT6Rk,7478719,7484320,blaine alexander is in jackson  mississippi where the state's only  abortion clinic is located it's the very
UVob8FMT6Rk,7484320,7491280,same clinic that went to court to  challenge the mississippi abortion ban  at the heart of today's decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,7491280,7496480,blaine what are you hearing there today  well lester that clinic is only about a
UVob8FMT6Rk,7496480,7501920,mile or so away from where i'm standing  it's jackson women's health organization  the very clinic that's at the center of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7501920,7507679,this entire ruling we expect to hear  from them in a press conference later  today at about four o'clock eastern time
UVob8FMT6Rk,7507679,7514560,you know this is something that if you  drive by this clinic it's something that  has women who actually stand outside who
UVob8FMT6Rk,7514560,7520800,actually kind of protect the women who  go in who go behind this gate to get  abortion services at this clinic they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,7520800,7526560,called the peak pink house defenders  they take their job very seriously you  also see a number of protesters on any
UVob8FMT6Rk,7526560,7532719,given day so this is a place that really  has been at the center of this kind of  polarizing debate debate for quite some
UVob8FMT6Rk,7532719,7538639,time and even after that leaked draft  opinion came out some people who worked  there lester and speaking with them over
UVob8FMT6Rk,7538639,7543840,the past few weeks were still holding  out hope they said that it wasn't set in  stone that it wasn't a done deal of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7543840,7550320,course all of that changes today so  we're going to hear from them later this  afternoon for the first time since this  decision came down but lester i've got
UVob8FMT6Rk,7550320,7556239,to say talking to people on both sides  of the issue it's very clear that really  there is almost kind of a weight that
UVob8FMT6Rk,7556239,7563440,comes with the fact that this ruling  came from the state of mississippi when  you speak with people who have been  fighting for years to dismantle roe to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7563440,7570000,end abortion access they almost speak  with a sense of pride about the fact  that it comes from the state of  mississippi one woman told me that she
UVob8FMT6Rk,7570000,7575599,is absolutely in tears she feels like  it's a surreal moment and she calls it  just the beginning but if you go to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7575599,7580719,other side people who are fighting to  protect abortion rights here in the  state of mississippi this is an angry
UVob8FMT6Rk,7580719,7586079,day this is a very sad day for some of  them and they point to the specifics of  mississippi as one woman told me not too
UVob8FMT6Rk,7586079,7592000,long ago she says that women  specifically black women here in the  state are going to suffer this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,7592000,7597679,state when you kind of just look at the  numbers they're rather stunning lester  38 percent of the population here black
UVob8FMT6Rk,7597679,7603360,women but they account for about 75  percent of abortions in the state of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7603360,7609840,mississippi that's a stunning statistic  that's a stunning number and they say  that black women are going to be the  ones who really suffer the other thing i
UVob8FMT6Rk,7609840,7615920,want to point on touch on lester is the  timing here you know there is a 10-day  gap between when the attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,7615920,7621760,here in the state of mississippi says  that the law has officially been  triggered before abortions become
UVob8FMT6Rk,7621760,7627760,illegal so when i was speaking with some  abortion rights advocates they say  they're going to use that 10-day gap  they're going to be putting out
UVob8FMT6Rk,7627760,7633280,education they're going to be telling  women that hey your rights are still  intact for the time being but also
UVob8FMT6Rk,7633280,7638480,letting them know that the landscape is  about to change vastly but overall  lester there is a very strong sense of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7638480,7643920,resignation among some of those women  who have been fighting to protect  abortion rights here in mississippi okay
UVob8FMT6Rk,7643920,7649840,blaine thank you for that nbc news  correspondent josh letterman is at the  white house where we expect to hear from
UVob8FMT6Rk,7649840,7656560,the president at any moment now  josh do we know what what the president  will talk about obviously he'll react to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7656560,7663280,this but what what he will perhaps  propose going forward in his power  he will lester officials tell us that
UVob8FMT6Rk,7663280,7670400,the president will start to lay out what  he feels that the biden administration  can do to try to preserve the ability to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7670400,7676400,get an abortion for as many women in the  country as possible now that  is not going to look like an executive
UVob8FMT6Rk,7676400,7682239,order that suddenly restores uh the  right to an abortion nationwide that is  something that is outside of president
UVob8FMT6Rk,7682239,7689199,biden's power only congress can do that  and so we expect to hear president biden  once again call on congress to codify
UVob8FMT6Rk,7689199,7696639,the right to an abortion as well as for  voters to choose lawmakers in the fall  and in other elections who will vote to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7696639,7702480,create and preserve the ability for  women across the country to get  abortions but we also
UVob8FMT6Rk,7702480,7708480,are told that the president will start  to lay out what some of the federal  agencies can do around the margins
UVob8FMT6Rk,7708480,7714719,there's nothing sweeping that he can do  but to try to make sure that as many  women have access as possible things for
UVob8FMT6Rk,7714719,7721360,example like what the justice department  can do to preserve the ability for women  to cross state lines if they live in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,7721360,7728560,state where abortion is going to be  prohibited and want to go somewhere else  to seek access to abortion also making
UVob8FMT6Rk,7728560,7733599,sure that the states cannot pass  laws to try to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7733599,7739040,outlaw certain medications for abortion  that the fda has already deemed to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,7739040,7744560,safe and effective something we heard  about in a statement that attorney  general merrick garland put out today
UVob8FMT6Rk,7744560,7750400,saying that he was deeply disappointed  by the ruling but that the justice  department working with the white house
UVob8FMT6Rk,7750400,7755679,fd and other agencies will do everything  it can to ensure the ability for women
UVob8FMT6Rk,7755679,7762719,to access reproductive health rights a  significant moment for the president  also politically as he tries to convey
UVob8FMT6Rk,7762719,7769840,the sense of frustration and outrage  that so many of his supporters are now  voicing today in the wake of this ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,7769840,7775440,we are also learning just now lester  about dr jill biden the first lady how
UVob8FMT6Rk,7775440,7781440,she learned of this decision today a  white house official telling me that the  first lady was with none other than
UVob8FMT6Rk,7781440,7789119,republican governor ron desantis of  florida at the moment when she learned  of this decision a desantis a republican
UVob8FMT6Rk,7789119,7794239,who just in april signed a law banning  abortion in florida after 15 weeks of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7794239,7800719,pregnancy the first lady was with him  preparing to go on stage at a memorial  for the surf side collapse the one-year
UVob8FMT6Rk,7800719,7805840,anniversary of that tragedy when she  found out from alerts on her phone a
UVob8FMT6Rk,7805840,7811440,similar way to me how many of the white  house officials here learned of this  decision today something they had
UVob8FMT6Rk,7811440,7818320,anticipated they had already prepared  some remarks for president biden to  deliver if the ruling came out this way
UVob8FMT6Rk,7818320,7824320,but still many expecting that it would  not have necessarily come as early as  today and now white house officials
UVob8FMT6Rk,7824320,7830000,trying to make sure they have everything  lined up for president biden to be able  to communicate to the american people
UVob8FMT6Rk,7830000,7836880,exactly what he feels he can do uh to  try to make sure as many people as  possible retain the ability to get
UVob8FMT6Rk,7836880,7843599,reproductive health care including  abortions and josh we knew the the  ruling would come down perhaps today or  tomorrow the white house had no insight
UVob8FMT6Rk,7843599,7849760,here presumably but we're prepared  for this moment and and we'll i'm  assuming he's going to speak now really
UVob8FMT6Rk,7849760,7855440,in forward-looking terms  that's right lester we expect president  biden to
UVob8FMT6Rk,7855440,7861760,address the fact that this is now the  reality the supreme court has now said  that there's not this constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,7861760,7868719,right as we've been discussing so many  of these states will now have these laws  triggered into effect uh president biden
UVob8FMT6Rk,7868719,7875840,expected to address not only what his  administration is going to do but also  what americans who disagree with this
UVob8FMT6Rk,7875840,7883199,supreme court a decision should do going  forward to make sure that they work  toward preserving and expanding the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7883199,7890480,ability for women to access these rights  as we see president biden taking uh to  the podium to speak right here today is
UVob8FMT6Rk,7890480,7896719,a uh  [Music]  it's not hyperbole to suggest a very  solemn moment
UVob8FMT6Rk,7896719,7903040,today the supreme court of the united  states  expressly took away  a constitutional right from the american
UVob8FMT6Rk,7903040,7909760,people  that it already recognized  they didn't limit it they simply took it
UVob8FMT6Rk,7909760,7916400,away  never been done to a right so important  to so many americans
UVob8FMT6Rk,7916400,7922320,but they did it  it's a sad day for the court and for the  country
UVob8FMT6Rk,7922320,7927520,50 years ago roe v wade  was decided and has been the law of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7927520,7932800,land since then  this landmark case protected a woman's  right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,7932800,7939599,her right to make intensely personal  decisions with her doctor  free from entertainment interference of
UVob8FMT6Rk,7939599,7945760,politics  it reaffirmed basic principles of  equality  that women have the power to control
UVob8FMT6Rk,7945760,7951199,their own destiny  and it reinforced a fundamental right of  privacy
UVob8FMT6Rk,7951199,7956400,the right of each of us to choose how to  live our lives
UVob8FMT6Rk,7956400,7962639,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,7962639,7967920,nation  are now at risk  as chairman and ranking member of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,7967920,7973440,senate judiciary committee  as vice president now as president  united states
UVob8FMT6Rk,7973440,7980719,i've studied this case carefully  i've overseen more supreme court  confirmations than anyone today
UVob8FMT6Rk,7980719,7986800,where this case was always discussed  i believe roe v wade was the correct
UVob8FMT6Rk,7986800,7992239,decision  as a matter of constitutional law and  application of the fundamental right
UVob8FMT6Rk,7992239,7997760,to privacy and liberty and matters of  family and personal autonomy
UVob8FMT6Rk,7997760,8003119,it was a decision  on a complex matter  that drew a careful balance between a
UVob8FMT6Rk,8003119,8009119,woman's right to choose  earlier in her pregnancy and the state's  ability to regulate
UVob8FMT6Rk,8009119,8014400,later in her pregnancy  a decision with broad national consensus
UVob8FMT6Rk,8014400,8019599,that most americans of faith  and backgrounds found acceptable
UVob8FMT6Rk,8019599,8026000,that have been the law of the land for  most of the lifetime  of americans today
UVob8FMT6Rk,8026000,8031840,and it was a constitutional principle  upheld  by justices appointed by democrat
UVob8FMT6Rk,8031840,8038639,and republican presidents alike  roe v wade was a 7-2 decision written by
UVob8FMT6Rk,8038639,8045199,a justice appointed by a republican  president richard nixon  in the five decades that followed roe v
UVob8FMT6Rk,8045199,8051440,wade justice is appointed by republican  presidents from eisenhower  nixon and reagan
UVob8FMT6Rk,8051440,8058320,george w bush  were among the justices who voted to  uphold the principles set forth in roe v
UVob8FMT6Rk,8058320,8063440,wade  it was three justices named by one
UVob8FMT6Rk,8063440,8069840,president donald trump  we're the core of today's decision to  upend the scales of justice and
UVob8FMT6Rk,8069840,8074880,eliminate a fundamental right  for women in this country
UVob8FMT6Rk,8074880,8081679,make no mistake  this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades
UVob8FMT6Rk,8081679,8088400,to upset  the balance of our law  it's a realization of an extreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,8088400,8094320,ideology and a tragic error by the  supreme court in my view  the court has done what it has never
UVob8FMT6Rk,8094320,8100880,done before  expressly take away a constitutional  right  that is so fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,8100880,8106960,to so many americans that had already  been recognized  the court's decision to do so will have
UVob8FMT6Rk,8106960,8112639,real and immediate consequences  state laws banning abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,8112639,8118159,are automatically taking effect today  jeopardizing the health of millions of
UVob8FMT6Rk,8118159,8123840,women  some without exceptions  so extreme that women could be punished
UVob8FMT6Rk,8123840,8130239,for protecting her health  so extreme that women and girls were  forced to bear their rapist
UVob8FMT6Rk,8130239,8137840,child  for the child of consequence
UVob8FMT6Rk,8138239,8143840,it's a  it just it just  stuns me
UVob8FMT6Rk,8143840,8150960,so extreme the doctors will be  criminalized for fulfilling their duty  to care
UVob8FMT6Rk,8150960,8156639,imagine having  a young woman having to  carry a child
UVob8FMT6Rk,8156639,8162480,of incest as a consequence of incest  no option
UVob8FMT6Rk,8162480,8169520,too often the case  the poor women are going to be hit the  hardest  it's cruel
UVob8FMT6Rk,8169520,8176719,in fact the court laid out  state laws criminalizing abortion  that go back to the 1800s
UVob8FMT6Rk,8176719,8184719,as a rationale the court literally  taking america back 150 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,8184719,8191440,this is a sad day for the country in my  view  but it doesn't mean the fight's over
UVob8FMT6Rk,8191440,8196719,let me be very clear and unambiguous  the only way we can secure a woman's
UVob8FMT6Rk,8196719,8202399,right to choose  the balance that existed  is for congress to restore the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8202399,8207841,protections of roe v wade as federal law
UVob8FMT6Rk,8207920,8213439,no executive action from the president  can do that  and if congress
UVob8FMT6Rk,8213439,8221840,as it appears  lacks the vote votes to do that now  voters need to make their voices heard
UVob8FMT6Rk,8221840,8227518,this fall  we must elect more senators  representatives who will codify
UVob8FMT6Rk,8227518,8233678,the woman's right to choose in the  federal law once again  elect more state leaders to protect this
UVob8FMT6Rk,8233678,8241120,right  at the local level  we need to restore the protections of  roe  as law of the land we need to elect
UVob8FMT6Rk,8241120,8247678,officials who will do that  this fall roe is on the ballot
UVob8FMT6Rk,8247678,8253840,personal freedoms are on the ballot  the right to privacy  liberty equality
UVob8FMT6Rk,8253840,8258880,they're all on the ballot  until then
UVob8FMT6Rk,8258880,8264880,i will do all of my power to protect a  woman's right in states  where they will face the consequences of
UVob8FMT6Rk,8264880,8271040,today's decision  while the court's decision casts a dark  shadow over a large swath of the land
UVob8FMT6Rk,8271040,8277840,many states in this country still  recognize the woman's right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,8277840,8284160,so  if a woman lives in a state that  restricts abortion  the supreme court's decision does not
UVob8FMT6Rk,8284160,8289678,prevent her from traveling from her home  state to the state that allows it
UVob8FMT6Rk,8289678,8296240,does not prevent a doctor  in that state  and that state from treating her
UVob8FMT6Rk,8296240,8301280,as the attorney general has made clear  women must remain free to travel safely
UVob8FMT6Rk,8301280,8307439,to another state to seek care they need  my administration will defend that
UVob8FMT6Rk,8307439,8312800,bedrock right  if any state or local official high or  low
UVob8FMT6Rk,8312800,8319598,tries to interfere with the woman's  exercise and her basic right to travel i  will do everything in my power
UVob8FMT6Rk,8319598,8324719,to fight that deeply un-american attack  my administration will also protect the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8324719,8331040,woman's access to medications  that are approved by the food and drug  administration the fda
UVob8FMT6Rk,8331040,8336960,like contraception  which is essential for preventative  healthcare
UVob8FMT6Rk,8336960,8344478,mifo prestone  which the fda approved 20 years ago  to safely end early pregnancies
UVob8FMT6Rk,8344478,8350000,and is commonly used to treat  miscarriages  some states are saying that they'll try
UVob8FMT6Rk,8350000,8355359,to ban or severely restrict access to  these medications
UVob8FMT6Rk,8355359,8361598,but extremist governors and state  legislators are looking to block the  mail or search the person's medicine
UVob8FMT6Rk,8361598,8366880,cabinet or control a woman's actions by  tracking data on her apps she uses are
UVob8FMT6Rk,8366880,8373678,wrong and extreme and out of touch  with the majority of americans
UVob8FMT6Rk,8373678,8380000,the american medical association  the american college of obstetricians  and gynecologists
UVob8FMT6Rk,8380000,8386800,wrote to me and vice president harris  stressing that these laws are not based  on are not based on evidence and asking
UVob8FMT6Rk,8386800,8392720,us to act to protect access to care they  say  by limiting access to these medicines
UVob8FMT6Rk,8392720,8398800,maternal mortality will climb in america  that's what they say
UVob8FMT6Rk,8398800,8404319,today i'm directing the department of  health and human services to take steps
UVob8FMT6Rk,8404319,8410319,to ensure these critical medications are  available to the fullest extent possible
UVob8FMT6Rk,8410319,8415359,and the politicians cannot interfere  in the decisions that should be made
UVob8FMT6Rk,8415359,8421359,between a woman and her doctor  and my administration will remain  vigilant
UVob8FMT6Rk,8421359,8427600,as the implications of this decision  play out  i've warned about how this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,8427600,8434000,risked the broader right to privacy for  everyone  that's because roe recognized the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8434000,8439760,fundamental right to privacy  that has served as a basis for so many
UVob8FMT6Rk,8439760,8445680,more rights that have come to take we've  come to take for granted  that are ingrained in the fabric of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,8445680,8451439,country  the right to make the best decisions for  your health
UVob8FMT6Rk,8451439,8457520,the right to use birth control a married  couple in the privacy of their bedroom  for god's sake
UVob8FMT6Rk,8457520,8463920,the right to marry the person you love  justice thomas said as much today he
UVob8FMT6Rk,8463920,8469359,explicitly called  to reconsider the right of marriage  equality
UVob8FMT6Rk,8469359,8474479,the right of couples to make their  choices on contraception
UVob8FMT6Rk,8474960,8482479,this extreme and dangerous path the  court is now taking us on  let me close the two points
UVob8FMT6Rk,8482479,8488720,first  i call on everyone no matter how deeply  they care about this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,8488720,8494800,to keep all protests peaceful  peaceful peaceful peaceful no
UVob8FMT6Rk,8494800,8500640,intimidation  violence is never acceptable  threats
UVob8FMT6Rk,8500640,8506479,and tim and intimidation are not speech  we must stand against violence in any
UVob8FMT6Rk,8506479,8511680,form  regardless of your rationale  second
UVob8FMT6Rk,8511680,8517680,i  know so many of us are frustrated and  disillusioned the court has taken
UVob8FMT6Rk,8517680,8522960,something away that's so fundamental  i know so many women are now going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,8522960,8529359,face incredibly difficult situations  i hear you  i support you
UVob8FMT6Rk,8529359,8534399,i stand with you  the consequences
UVob8FMT6Rk,8534399,8539520,and the consensus  of the american people
UVob8FMT6Rk,8539520,8545200,core principles of equality  liberty  dignity
UVob8FMT6Rk,8545200,8552240,and the stability of the rule of law  demand that rose should not have been  overturned
UVob8FMT6Rk,8552240,8558479,with this decision  the conservative majority of the supreme  court shows how extreme it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,8558479,8565200,how far removed they are from the  majority of this country  they made the united states an outlier
UVob8FMT6Rk,8565200,8571600,among developed nations in the world  but this decision must not be the final
UVob8FMT6Rk,8571600,8577840,word  my administration will use all of its  appropriate lawful powers
UVob8FMT6Rk,8577840,8584479,but congress must act  and with your vote  you can act
UVob8FMT6Rk,8584479,8590240,you can have the final word  this is not over
UVob8FMT6Rk,8590240,8595359,thank you very much more to say this in  weeks to come thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,8597520,8602960,president taking no questions calling  this a solemn day uh recognizing he has
UVob8FMT6Rk,8602960,8608399,few levers at his disposal to  reverse what we saw take place today
UVob8FMT6Rk,8608399,8614720,calling on congress to restore the  protections of roe v wade  and at the same time calling on voters
UVob8FMT6Rk,8614720,8622640,saying roe is on the ballot so making a  very clear and impassioned case for  voters to recognize the consequences
UVob8FMT6Rk,8622640,8628720,of their decision to vote or not let's  bring in nbc news washington  correspondent yamiche alcindor
UVob8FMT6Rk,8628720,8633920,yamiche  did the president have anything else he  could offer that maybe he didn't mention
UVob8FMT6Rk,8633920,8639520,here  lester this was one of the most  important speeches that president biden
UVob8FMT6Rk,8639520,8646160,has made  since he came into office and it is  on a topic that is politically very very
UVob8FMT6Rk,8646160,8651760,complicated for him because he does not  have at his disposal anything that he  can really do to reverse what the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8651760,8659359,supreme court has done today which is of  course overturned roe v wade setting  back precedent of nearly 50 years the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8659359,8665520,president though was mixing politics and  passion here of course he was talking  about the fact that this is tragic and
UVob8FMT6Rk,8665520,8672160,cruel saying that he is going to make  sure that this is not over also calling  out the fact that these are people by
UVob8FMT6Rk,8672160,8677520,name that he wanted to talk about he  hardly often he hardly ever really talks  about former president trump by name but
UVob8FMT6Rk,8677520,8683439,today you heard him say that name  because he wanted to focus the nation's  attention to exactly how we got here  because of course this is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8683439,8688640,culmination of decades of work by the  conservative movement to make sure that
UVob8FMT6Rk,8688640,8694080,abortion would be overturned that there  would be bans going into place across  the nation something else that he said
UVob8FMT6Rk,8694080,8700479,that was really really important and you  got it it's that it's that personal  freedoms he believes are on the ballot  because democrats are now going to have
UVob8FMT6Rk,8700479,8708000,to make the case that if they get power  back and if they can hold on to power um  that they will be able to try to give
UVob8FMT6Rk,8708000,8713120,women in this country more access to  abortion but it's not really clear how  they're going to do that talking to
UVob8FMT6Rk,8713120,8719359,sources in the democratic party they are  scrambling and upset and devastated but  they don't actually know what to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,8719359,8724479,at this point to really overturn on what  the supreme court has done here and i  should say i've been talking to
UVob8FMT6Rk,8724479,8730080,the head of the women's clinic in  jackson mississippi that is the center  of this and she told me just a few weeks
UVob8FMT6Rk,8730080,8736319,ago that she has no hope that congress  or the president can help her in this  moment and that she does not believe
UVob8FMT6Rk,8736319,8742880,that they're going to be able to do  anything legislatively to hand back  these rights to women so it's really  with that in mind that the president is
UVob8FMT6Rk,8742880,8748880,making this pitch to the midterms and to  really making sure that democrats have  something to talk about to try to make
UVob8FMT6Rk,8748880,8754960,the case that they should win elections  around this country because  conservatives are already making the  case that they are celebrating that they
UVob8FMT6Rk,8754960,8760960,can get things done um we already heard  former president trump say that he  believes this is god's decision and that
UVob8FMT6Rk,8760960,8767600,the supreme court is doing what should  have been done a long time ago so  conservatives are already celebrating  and thinking about what's next for them
UVob8FMT6Rk,8767600,8774160,and democrats are doing the same but  lester what we heard from the president  today was one of the most impassioned  speeches that he's ever given and it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,8774160,8779840,on a topic that is so complicated and so  tough for him amid so many other  challenges facing this white house okay
UVob8FMT6Rk,8779840,8786319,yamiche thank you very much joining us  now is alexis mcgill johnson planned  parenthood president and ceo we
UVob8FMT6Rk,8786319,8792960,appreciate you being with us i just want  to get your your immediate reaction if  you were able to hear  the the president he seems to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,8792960,8798319,acknowledging he doesn't have a lot of  options as as in in his executive power
UVob8FMT6Rk,8798319,8804880,and really turning to congress but as we  know that really is a bit of a  non-starter what are your thoughts
UVob8FMT6Rk,8805359,8810479,look i think first and foremost he's  absolutely right roe is on the ballot  and we are clear about how we got here
UVob8FMT6Rk,8810479,8816800,right politicians who believe that they  can make better decisions about our  bodies that we can and justices who  essentially lied about their respect for
UVob8FMT6Rk,8816800,8821840,precedent 49 years of precedent to be  precise so i think that the president um
UVob8FMT6Rk,8821840,8827040,struck absolutely the right tone we need  a strong response from all levels of
UVob8FMT6Rk,8827040,8832800,government and centering the the patient  centering the people who will be most
UVob8FMT6Rk,8832800,8839520,impacted  is critically important uh we hope to  see additional actions in the days to  come right i mean we in addition to
UVob8FMT6Rk,8839520,8844880,reaffirming the right to travel we also  need the administration to step in with  getting people assistance to travel out
UVob8FMT6Rk,8844880,8851200,of state for care because we know these  are the people who uh for whom um  getting access to abortion care uh will
UVob8FMT6Rk,8851200,8856240,become out of reach  as we're speaking there there are states  now that are making their decision to
UVob8FMT6Rk,8856240,8861600,their their trigger laws are going into  effect um  and we're seeing cases where some of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8861600,8867840,some of these uh laws uh make exceptions  for incest and rape others don't we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,8867840,8874560,hearing talk about uh whether certain  contraceptives would maybe fall under  the umbrella of things considered
UVob8FMT6Rk,8874560,8881521,illegal what are you  what are you defending right now what  what is your biggest fear at this moment
UVob8FMT6Rk,8882240,8889600,my biggest fear is that uh that you're  exactly right right that is not just the  criminalization of uh of abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,8889600,8895280,provision uh that will there there will  be a position of contraception of iuds
UVob8FMT6Rk,8895280,8900720,right of uh plan b emergency  contraception  of ivf in some cases that have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,8900720,8906640,introduced that's our big worry about  what uh  what then obviously we'll conserve the
UVob8FMT6Rk,8906640,8914560,patients who are seeking uh abortion  today right the patients who are waking  up uh today um uh knowing that they can
UVob8FMT6Rk,8914560,8921200,no longer uh get access to abortion  um  alexis uh thank you for being with us uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,8921200,8926720,let me bring in carol tobias she's the  president of the national right to life  committee carol we appreciate uh you
UVob8FMT6Rk,8926720,8932080,joining us the president uh a few  moments ago really  talked about this in terms of a loss of
UVob8FMT6Rk,8932080,8938080,right to privacy how do you respond to  that  what i noticed in the president's speech
UVob8FMT6Rk,8938080,8944560,is that not once did he mention that in  every abortion an unborn child dies a
UVob8FMT6Rk,8944560,8952399,living breathing  you know human being who is um  not going to be around anymore
UVob8FMT6Rk,8952399,8958399,the court  i believe  correctly decided or ruled that there is
UVob8FMT6Rk,8958399,8964319,no such right to abortion in the  constitution um i know your previous  speaker was talking about pres
UVob8FMT6Rk,8964319,8970160,precedence um but the precedence is the  u.s constitution the laws that were on
UVob8FMT6Rk,8970160,8976720,the books in the states prior to 1973  roe v wade was an aberration it was a
UVob8FMT6Rk,8976720,8982399,grievous decision and the court made the  correct decision today  desire
UVob8FMT6Rk,8982399,8988560,deception and a double cross  the seduction a deadly love story only
UVob8FMT6Rk,8988560,8995359,dateline and keith morrison can the  victory for those forces today but what  is next on the agenda
UVob8FMT6Rk,8995359,9002000,we are going to protect as many babies  as we can and we are going to help as  many mothers as we can
UVob8FMT6Rk,9002000,9009200,we've got a lot of states that have come  forward with various programs to help a  woman take care of her child support her
UVob8FMT6Rk,9009200,9015840,child uh health and wellness checkups  whatever she needs and i expect to see a  lot more of that we are going to do what
UVob8FMT6Rk,9015840,9022720,we can to make this country a  pro-baby pro-mom  pro-life country well we appreciate you
UVob8FMT6Rk,9022720,9030080,sharing your thoughts and being on with  us today as well thank you  let's get some final thoughts now let me  go to hallie first howie you had laid
UVob8FMT6Rk,9030080,9036319,out in one of our earlier conversations  this this patchwork now  of laws and and and that picture is
UVob8FMT6Rk,9036319,9042720,changing even as we're speaking right  now  lester it's such an important point  because it is extraordinary how fast
UVob8FMT6Rk,9042720,9048240,this is moving already just since this  decision has come down at 10 o'clock  eastern today i think people often
UVob8FMT6Rk,9048240,9053439,sometimes think well the the levers of  government work slowly not today not  after this you already have multiple
UVob8FMT6Rk,9053439,9060479,states now that in the course of just  the last three hours have moved now to  outright ban abortion so people in those
UVob8FMT6Rk,9060479,9066080,states who woke up with one right are  going to go to bed or eat lunch or have  dinner under a different set of rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,9066080,9072240,that they have access to and i think  that the speed at which this has moved  is important to note because we don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,9072240,9078720,see this often we talked about how this  day makes history i think that's one of  the reasons why you're seeing on your  screen now some of the places where
UVob8FMT6Rk,9078720,9084479,abortions  will not be accessible in states that  have trigger laws  not all of these states is this
UVob8FMT6Rk,9084479,9089760,happening today or right away in some  states it's let's say 30 days etc but  over the course of the next month or so
UVob8FMT6Rk,9089760,9096720,you will see these laws either outright  banning or restricting abortion go into  place the other piece of this as we look  ahead to what's next is
UVob8FMT6Rk,9096720,9102479,the political fight that is to come and  i think it is exemplified based on two  perspectives that we've gotten in just
UVob8FMT6Rk,9102479,9108800,today one comes from former vice  president mike pence who said in a  statement that we must not rest until as
UVob8FMT6Rk,9108800,9115600,he says the sanctity of life is restored  to the center of law in every state in  the land every state in the land the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9115600,9121600,democratic national committee is picking  up on that what specifically mike pence  has said and he said this is what's at
UVob8FMT6Rk,9121600,9127280,stake in november that is the view of  democrats right this fight now extends  beyond what we've seen so far as it
UVob8FMT6Rk,9127280,9133280,relates to abortion rights access  the people who would like to see  anti-abortion law become the law of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9133280,9139439,land and every state will fight on that  front you will see on the federal and  state level the push back against it i
UVob8FMT6Rk,9139439,9145680,go back to what the inimitable pete  williams said about 30 seconds into us  getting this decision which is we are in
UVob8FMT6Rk,9145680,9152240,a divided country now that feels  exceptionally true today lester  so then haley uh yeah yamiche let me go
UVob8FMT6Rk,9152240,9159120,to you very quickly on this you know as  as we look at the impact of this we've  heard a lot of that conversation but  it's one of those things that
UVob8FMT6Rk,9159120,9164160,doesn't directly impact you until it  directly impacts you um this is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,9164160,9171280,unfold i i would think over not weeks  but months  certainly and there are we know
UVob8FMT6Rk,9171280,9177840,according to the good mocker institute  that there are something like 26 states  that are ready to um ban or heavily
UVob8FMT6Rk,9177840,9184479,restrict abortion already having those  ideas in place and those actions in  place i also know that in conversations
UVob8FMT6Rk,9184479,9190720,with people who provide access that it's  going to be poor women and women of  color who are going to be most impacted
UVob8FMT6Rk,9190720,9196160,by this they're going to be the women  who have to get into their cars and  drive 18 hours if sometimes if you live
UVob8FMT6Rk,9196160,9202560,in the south to get to an abortion  clinic that may may possibly give you  help if you also have to end up on a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9202560,9209280,waitlist i also talked to a group in  louisiana that said that it's not just  going to be easy to go and travel now
UVob8FMT6Rk,9209280,9215359,waiting lists already sometimes 300  women sometimes waiting weeks to get an  abortion so it's going to be a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9215359,9221040,complicated landscape for those women i  also talked to  the the head of again of of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9221040,9227439,mississippi clinic at the center of this  and she said she's moving her clinic to  new mexico so that tells you that if you
UVob8FMT6Rk,9227439,9233359,were someone who was working  with women in mississippi now the  closest place is new mexico um and we
UVob8FMT6Rk,9233359,9240399,should also note that one in four women  in this country before the age of 45 say  that they've had an abortion so this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,9240399,9247120,a sweeping impact that we're going to  see across the country and nbc news  polling shows that 60 of americans they
UVob8FMT6Rk,9247120,9252640,want to see abortion  be legal in some way in this country so  as we look at this landscape and the sea
UVob8FMT6Rk,9252640,9258000,change this generational change in  abortion access we have to  really keep in mind who's going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,9258000,9264319,most impacted and how hard it's going to  be in this country my eye is also on the  district of columbia while it's a very
UVob8FMT6Rk,9264319,9271359,deeply blue place there are going to be  women in the district of columbia who  think maybe they're protected because  they live in a blue city that may
UVob8FMT6Rk,9271359,9276399,possibly face federal um changes to  their right to abortion so this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,9276399,9283439,really going to be a long long  conversation that we're going to have in  your right to say that it's going to be  weeks and months when we think about the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9283439,9288560,assessing how this is going to impact  people all right yamiche thank you very  much let me bring back uh chuck todd in
UVob8FMT6Rk,9288560,9294479,for some final thoughts i wanted to get  your comments really about some of what  the president say he mentioned donald
UVob8FMT6Rk,9294479,9300080,trump's name and and his role  in three of the three of these justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,9300080,9305359,you know it's interesting just just take  a let's take a step back and just think  about the the consequential actions of
UVob8FMT6Rk,9305359,9311120,this week  um the gun the two supreme court rulings  that sort of certainly uh that undid one
UVob8FMT6Rk,9311120,9318399,law was 110 years old this one is 50  years old you have what former president  trump attempted to do to the democracy
UVob8FMT6Rk,9318399,9323520,we learned that in chilling detail uh  all of the last couple of weeks
UVob8FMT6Rk,9323520,9329040,yesterday in particular are arguably two  hours away from a massive constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,9329040,9335520,crisis  throw in what the divisiveness that  donald trump has created in the  immigration debate
UVob8FMT6Rk,9335520,9341040,and you really can't help but look back  at 2016  that election and the entrance of donald
UVob8FMT6Rk,9341040,9347760,trump into our politics and he really  has sort of shattered a lot of the  stability we had in american society he
UVob8FMT6Rk,9347760,9353120,has been the linchpin of shattering our  stability on unreproductive rights or  stability on
UVob8FMT6Rk,9353120,9358319,on immigration or stability even in some  ways uh obviously on the democracy
UVob8FMT6Rk,9358319,9363680,and we're we're in a rough place as a  country and as a society we're not just  polarized
UVob8FMT6Rk,9363680,9369439,um  we're divided in ways that that that  feels so fundamental and you're not sure
UVob8FMT6Rk,9369439,9375920,how we bring each other back  we are divided in our information silos  so look i'm very concerned about the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9375920,9381439,fallout from all of what we've seen just  this week  former president could be put on trial
UVob8FMT6Rk,9381439,9386560,um this is we're a tinderbox right now  and and i and i think our um our elected
UVob8FMT6Rk,9386560,9392319,leaders particularly on the right  um are  put some blinders on and i have not
UVob8FMT6Rk,9392319,9397840,fully appreciated  what's been unleashed on our society and
UVob8FMT6Rk,9397840,9403840,on that thought thank you chuck that  concludes our coverage of this historic  ruling i'm lester holt i'll have much
UVob8FMT6Rk,9403840,9409600,more of course this evening on nbc  nightly news for now we'll leave you  with some of the reaction from outside
UVob8FMT6Rk,9409600,9415200,the supreme court today on both sides of  this divisive issue i see tears
UVob8FMT6Rk,9415200,9422160,streaming down your face  what does this mean to you today  it feels like a betrayal it feels like
UVob8FMT6Rk,9422160,9429120,my country doesn't love me and  appreciate my body as a woman  um i can't even i can't even chant
UVob8FMT6Rk,9429120,9435840,because i i can't say anything  it just hurts  so i was in the middle of praying when
UVob8FMT6Rk,9435840,9442160,we found out the decision was made and i  am  i'm overjoyed now i
UVob8FMT6Rk,9442160,9447920,it there's honestly no words that can  describe the way that i feel right now  um i've been waiting for this for a long
UVob8FMT6Rk,9447920,9455200,time and i know other people have been  waiting for this longer than i have  and i was definitely not expecting it to  come this soon but i'm very grateful it
UVob8FMT6Rk,9455200,9462530,did and  it's it's shocking like  how can something how can such an
UVob8FMT6Rk,9462530,9469359,[Music]  like and this is something that women  should have a right to like
UVob8FMT6Rk,9469359,9477439,it's i just don't i can't  i'm excited but we all as if you can you
UVob8FMT6Rk,9477439,9484080,can see the celebration but we all know  this is not where the work ends this is  where it begins because from
UVob8FMT6Rk,9484080,9489520,anyone you can ask this is what we're  working for for the rest of our lives to  make abortion illegal unthinkable and
UVob8FMT6Rk,9489520,9496720,unnecessary  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,9496720,9501920,i'm aaron gilchrist at nbc news  headquarters in new york let's get right  to the breaking news from the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,9501920,9507680,court today the justices overturning roe  v wade upending decades of precedent and
UVob8FMT6Rk,9507680,9512960,ending the constitutional right to an  abortion  the court voted six to three to uphold a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9512960,9519840,mississippi law banning abortion after  15 weeks justice samuel alito writing in  the majority opinion quote abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,9519840,9526000,presents a profound moral question the  constitution does not prohibit the  citizens of each state from regulating
UVob8FMT6Rk,9526000,9531520,or prohibiting abortion row and casey  arrogate that authority the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,9531520,9537520,overrules overrules those decisions and  returns that authority to the people and  their elected representatives now just
UVob8FMT6Rk,9537520,9544640,moments ago president biden calling this  a sad day for the court and the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,9544640,9550880,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,9550880,9557120,nation  are now at risk it's a realization of an  extreme ideology and a tragic error by
UVob8FMT6Rk,9557120,9562479,the supreme court in my view  the court has done what is never done  before
UVob8FMT6Rk,9562479,9567600,expressly take away a constitutional  right  that is so fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,9567600,9574319,to so many americans  now that ruling has set off a flurry of  demonstrations outside the u.s supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,9574319,9579680,court the head of planned parenthood  calling it absolutely devastating
UVob8FMT6Rk,9579680,9586800,the court just told us that we are not  equal the court just told us that we  don't have a right in the constitution
UVob8FMT6Rk,9586800,9592560,to control our own bodies and i can't  think of anything more enraging more  absurd
UVob8FMT6Rk,9592560,9597920,more insane than overturning nearly 50  years of precedent of our ability to
UVob8FMT6Rk,9597920,9604239,control our own bodies it is absolutely  horrifying
UVob8FMT6Rk,9604399,9609520,we are covering every angle of this  historic ruling with a team of  correspondents across the country now we
UVob8FMT6Rk,9609520,9615439,also have experts here in studio to help  us understand the significance of this  moment i want to start with nbc's ken
UVob8FMT6Rk,9615439,9620960,delanian in washington for us today uh  ken this ruling was what 200 plus pages
UVob8FMT6Rk,9620960,9626800,long walk us through some of the key  points from this ruling  well andre
UVob8FMT6Rk,9626800,9631920,the ruling uh by justice alito pretty  much tracked as far as we can tell the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9631920,9637920,draft opinion that leaked so in that  sense it wasn't that much of a surprise  and it's and it's um sort of reflected a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9637920,9642960,long-held ideology on the right that row  versus wade was illegitimately decided
UVob8FMT6Rk,9642960,9648960,but you know i was standing outside the  supreme court when this decision was  announced and and that building opened
UVob8FMT6Rk,9648960,9655680,87 years ago and it struck me that for  49 of those years the right to an  abortion uh was believed to be enshrined
UVob8FMT6Rk,9655680,9662000,in the constitution and as you heard  there this is the first time the supreme  court has taken away a right from from
UVob8FMT6Rk,9662000,9667760,the american people and their political  and social repercussions of this  decision uh are incalculable and and
UVob8FMT6Rk,9667760,9673680,it's and it's absolutely manifest that  we got here because of politics it  started when um merrick garland who's
UVob8FMT6Rk,9673680,9678880,now the attorney general who was barack  obama's appointee of the supreme court  was not given a vote by the senate for
UVob8FMT6Rk,9678880,9686160,11 months and then donald trump was able  to appoint three very conservative  justices one of whom was uh confirmed by
UVob8FMT6Rk,9686160,9692240,the senate while the 2020 election was  underway and um and and one of whom  brett kavanaugh you know testified
UVob8FMT6Rk,9692240,9697439,before the senate that he believed that  roe v wade was settled law and precedent  on precedent so you have to really
UVob8FMT6Rk,9697439,9703680,wonder how the american people will view  the supreme court in the light of this  decision um whether it continues to have
UVob8FMT6Rk,9703680,9710000,a legitimacy that that it once had um  and and you know we're in a situation
UVob8FMT6Rk,9710000,9716399,where uh 60 of the american public and  according to our latest nbc news polling  believes that abortion to be legal in
UVob8FMT6Rk,9716399,9723120,some are all cases that is no longer the  law of the land and in many many states  across this country abortion will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,9723120,9729040,banned erin i want to get into some of  the nuances of the decision here ken if  we can the majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,9729040,9735520,ruling in favor of upholding this this  law in mississippi but chief justice  john roberts in particular didn't agree
UVob8FMT6Rk,9735520,9740800,with that that that entire group of the  conservatives on the court he wrote in  his opinion that he would not have
UVob8FMT6Rk,9740800,9746720,overturned roe v wade can you walk us  through that what was his reasoning  there  yeah that's right well roberts is an
UVob8FMT6Rk,9746720,9752720,incrementalist and and we always thought  that if there was going to be a surprise  if that leaked opinion wasn't going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,9752720,9758640,hold at the end of the day it would have  been because roberts found some way to  carve some kind of compromise
UVob8FMT6Rk,9758640,9765040,you know it appears that he is not a fan  of roe v wade but he thought that it was  this was too soon it's too dramatic a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9765040,9773040,head snapping move by the court to just  overturn it now um he would have found  some way to keep it in place um uh while
UVob8FMT6Rk,9773040,9778880,putting some further restrictions on  abortion but the other conservative  justices on the court just were not with
UVob8FMT6Rk,9778880,9787120,him on that um they just have long held  beliefs it's now very apparent that that  row was um was illegitimate and and
UVob8FMT6Rk,9787120,9794000,there's a whole movement in this country  that's behind them and they've been  going at this for many years trying to  get justices like this on the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,9794000,9799760,court and today they have succeeded  let's talk about the liberal justices if  we can stephen breyer elena kagan sonia
UVob8FMT6Rk,9799760,9807120,sotomayor they wrote the dissenting  opinion on this case help us understand  what they had to say about the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,9807120,9812640,you know i got to tell you to be  perfectly honest i've been standing in  front of the supreme court for most of  the morning so i haven't had a chance to
UVob8FMT6Rk,9812640,9818399,read their dissent but knowing what they  said during um during the arguments in  this case you know they they just
UVob8FMT6Rk,9818399,9824240,believe that um that the majority is  fundamentally wrong in the premise that  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,9824240,9830720,that there aren't that there isn't this  inherent right in the constitution um  and they believe they find a basis for
UVob8FMT6Rk,9830720,9836319,it they believe that even if roe is  flawed uh also uh leaving aside the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9836319,9843520,actual text of roe they believe that  this precedent um has existed for so  long that to overturn it um flies in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9843520,9849680,face of what the supreme court is  supposed to be all about but they did  not carry the day all right ken delaney  in for us in our washington bureau today
UVob8FMT6Rk,9849680,9855680,ken thank you nbc's maura barrett is  outside the supreme court for us now  she's joining us
UVob8FMT6Rk,9855680,9861279,maura the crowds there have been uh  growing throughout the morning  throughout the day here i think we have
UVob8FMT6Rk,9861279,9867359,there we are there's more for us she's  outside the court set the scene for us  what are you seeing out there
UVob8FMT6Rk,9868000,9875040,well aaron there was tension bubbling  starting this morning in the early hours  and there was maybe 150 200 people here
UVob8FMT6Rk,9875040,9880399,but there definitely were two distinct  groups now you can see behind me the  crowd has significantly grown and i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,9880399,9887120,going to let my photographer ronnie uh  kind of take a pan away so you can see  what we're seeing here and what's  interesting is the immediate aftermath
UVob8FMT6Rk,9887120,9892880,when the decision came down we saw a  large group of people who opposed  abortion rights jumping up and down
UVob8FMT6Rk,9892880,9899359,ecstatic one woman telling me she was  feeling utter joy but that group has  largely disappeared they they walked
UVob8FMT6Rk,9899359,9906399,away about 30 to 45 minutes ago in a  march around the supreme court but what  you see remaining now is a group of
UVob8FMT6Rk,9906399,9912240,people who support abortion rights  people who i saw crying  in despair immediately after the
UVob8FMT6Rk,9912240,9918880,decision came down in just moments  actually before we came on air with you  a large crowd of them putting their
UVob8FMT6Rk,9918880,9926240,middle finger up in the air for lack of  a better description towards the supreme  court cheering as president biden spoke
UVob8FMT6Rk,9926240,9933040,and having a general hopeful demeanor  despite the fact uh that they very much  are feeling that sense of loss
UVob8FMT6Rk,9933040,9939600,and defeat and so there while we started  out with a smaller crowd this morning as  you can see around me uh lots and lots
UVob8FMT6Rk,9939600,9946560,of more people coming to express how  they're feeling and we saw tears on both  sides tears of joy and tears of
UVob8FMT6Rk,9946560,9952640,disappointment erin i know you also had  a chance more to speak with a lot of the  people who are out there on both sides
UVob8FMT6Rk,9952640,9959681,of the abortion debate here what are  some of the demonstrators who support  abortion rights telling you today
UVob8FMT6Rk,9960479,9966240,well i want to play you some of those  conversations because it has been a  heavy conversation with each person i've
UVob8FMT6Rk,9966240,9972720,spoken with whether they support  abortion rights or they're against it  because this is something that for both  sides they've been waiting on for a
UVob8FMT6Rk,9972720,9978319,while now right we got that leaked draft  opinion uh by the court earlier this  year so this was something that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,9978319,9983680,expected but there was that  little bit of hope that people had to  see if it would be
UVob8FMT6Rk,9983680,9989520,changed if there had been compromised or  something like that might have happened  and so i want to hear some of the  conversation because
UVob8FMT6Rk,9989520,9996240,that didn't happen today and women young  women have been here crying to me as  well as older women who saw who have
UVob8FMT6Rk,9996240,10001760,experienced uh roe being passed and then  taken away from them so i way to hear  directly from some of these people i
UVob8FMT6Rk,10001760,10008240,spoke with  so for example for me personally i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,10008240,10014880,adopted  so knowing other mothers out there
UVob8FMT6Rk,10014880,10020240,okay  you can't make a choice
UVob8FMT6Rk,10020240,10027200,it's pretty hard to see like i was lucky  and i have a
UVob8FMT6Rk,10032000,10038840,and going over to the other side  especially  it was i wanted to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10038840,10045920,yell at the people there  just how  it feels like a betrayal it feels like
UVob8FMT6Rk,10045920,10051200,my country doesn't love me  and appreciate my body as a woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,10051200,10058060,i can't even i can't even chant because  i i can't say anything  it just hurts
UVob8FMT6Rk,10058060,10064479,[Music]  you heard from sky there saying she  feels like her country doesn't love her
UVob8FMT6Rk,10064479,10071359,i asked her if she has hope in congress  right we've heard president biden call  on congress uh saying that they need to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10071359,10078080,put this in  put row into law and she point blank  said to me she's like i want to have  hope in our lawmakers but seeing what
UVob8FMT6Rk,10078080,10085600,we've seen come down  this year and see how the the  divisiveness of this country just  continues she really didn't express any
UVob8FMT6Rk,10085600,10091680,hope and then i also want to play some  of the conversations that i had from  people who opposed abortion rights those  people that were jumping up and down
UVob8FMT6Rk,10091680,10097760,crying tears of joy one girl i spoke  with said that she has was here today  because she has family members who had
UVob8FMT6Rk,10097760,10104319,had abortions and has regretted them  ever since and so i wanted to get a  sense of the mood of the people who came
UVob8FMT6Rk,10104319,10111040,here and were celebrating today erin  take a listen  it's a roller coaster of emotion it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,10111040,10116479,it's  complete and utter joy that it was  finally overturned but the determination
UVob8FMT6Rk,10116479,10122960,of steely determination that the battle  is not over  personally i've had
UVob8FMT6Rk,10122960,10128560,people in my family have abortions and  they have felt the regret years and
UVob8FMT6Rk,10128560,10135279,years down the line and they're still  dealing and facing with the trauma today  and if roe v wade wouldn't have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,10135279,10141681,legal inside of the united states i  would have family members that i don't  have today
UVob8FMT6Rk,10142720,10148240,so even though we knew and we kind of  had an expectation of what this decision  would look like we did not know that it
UVob8FMT6Rk,10148240,10154000,was going to come down today right the  supreme court doesn't  release its schedule when opinions will  come so those people that were
UVob8FMT6Rk,10154000,10159600,celebrated and elated today also  expressed that this was still a surprise  because they didn't expect it to come
UVob8FMT6Rk,10159600,10164960,down today  and so there still is a lot of activity  clearly here at the supreme court the
UVob8FMT6Rk,10164960,10170720,president has warned against violent  protests but that is not what we've seen  yet here today instead this hopeful
UVob8FMT6Rk,10170720,10176560,energy uh that from people who support  abortion rights that this energy will be  brought to the ballot box come november
UVob8FMT6Rk,10176560,10182640,erin all right more barrett for us on  the ground on capitol hill outside the  supreme court today maura thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,10182640,10188800,now nbc news correspondent kathy park is  joining me now from jackson mississippi  where that state's only abortion clinic
UVob8FMT6Rk,10188800,10194080,is located uh kathy let's start with the  the leadership there in in mississippi
UVob8FMT6Rk,10194080,10198398,what are state leaders saying about this  decision today
UVob8FMT6Rk,10199439,10204800,hey there aaron good afternoon to you so  we actually saw a tweet from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,10204800,10211200,attorney general here in mississippi and  i should offer a little bit of context  because mississippi is a trigger loss
UVob8FMT6Rk,10211200,10216960,state so essentially now that roe v wade  has been overturned the state of  mississippi has this 10-day window for
UVob8FMT6Rk,10216960,10223520,the a.g to chime in and make this  official and she tweeted out earlier  today that this was a victory and
UVob8FMT6Rk,10223520,10229520,commended the court on their decision  and said that the work to empower women  truly begins today and she said looking
UVob8FMT6Rk,10229520,10235520,ahead they will be boosting resources  for adoptions as well as foster care but
UVob8FMT6Rk,10235520,10242640,aaron as you mentioned here in the state  of mississippi there is only one  abortion clinic that has been available
UVob8FMT6Rk,10242640,10249279,for quite some time and just a few  moments ago we were able to kind of get  a scene a sense of what is happening
UVob8FMT6Rk,10249279,10255279,there on the ground and you have both  sides of this debate rallying in front
UVob8FMT6Rk,10255279,10260880,of this abortion clinic but they are no  strangers to  this divisiveness right
UVob8FMT6Rk,10260880,10267279,but we are told that they have this  10-day window so there are folks who are  pro-choice and and want to educate
UVob8FMT6Rk,10267279,10272960,women here in mississippi that they have  this window to still  receive abortions legally
UVob8FMT6Rk,10272960,10278560,but once that happens  i guess that is the big  gray area as far as enforcement goes
UVob8FMT6Rk,10278560,10283840,what will happen to these women  who want to seek abortions and and a lot
UVob8FMT6Rk,10283840,10289040,of the folks who are affiliated with the  only clinic in mississippi they're  saying that it doesn't look good because
UVob8FMT6Rk,10289040,10294479,these women will be traveling hours away  the closest city  state being illinois to receive
UVob8FMT6Rk,10294479,10302000,abortions legally and safely and and  since this leak happened back in may  they were able to get ready for this
UVob8FMT6Rk,10302000,10307680,moment and a lot of folks that we spoke  with they're actually not surprised with  the announcement today so they were
UVob8FMT6Rk,10307680,10314160,preparing behind the scenes they have  money that they were  raising to help these women travel
UVob8FMT6Rk,10314160,10320880,because it's going to cost a whole lot  of money aaron to take a flight or  travel hours away to receive these
UVob8FMT6Rk,10320880,10327439,procedures in states where it is  accessible  erin all right kathy park for us in  jackson mississippi today kathy thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,10327439,10333760,you i want to bring in nbc news  investigative reporter chloe atkins and  nbc news legal analyst danny cevallos
UVob8FMT6Rk,10333760,10339760,now to sort of talk about it and try to  unpack all that we've seen uh so far  today danny i'll start with you and one
UVob8FMT6Rk,10339760,10345120,of the questions that has been presented  as a result of this decision is is one  around the idea that the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,10345120,10350160,for the first time has has given a right  and now taken a right away we with the
UVob8FMT6Rk,10350160,10356800,with the original decision 50 years ago  it established as as law that there was  this right to for women to to be able to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10356800,10362240,have an abortion and now it seems as  though that right has been taken away  yeah the court has overruled itself many
UVob8FMT6Rk,10362240,10367439,times and it will do again in the future  but it is exceedingly rare to overrule a
UVob8FMT6Rk,10367439,10373920,right that the court has recognized but  it has done it before centuries  literally centuries ago in a series of
UVob8FMT6Rk,10373920,10380560,cases that began with lochner where the  court recognized and the reason lochner  is so important is that's the genesis of
UVob8FMT6Rk,10380560,10387200,the rights that eventually led to roe v  wade the recognition of a right to  privacy in other words the unenumerated
UVob8FMT6Rk,10387200,10392800,rights that don't appear in the text of  the constitution we have two kinds we  have those that are enumerated the first
UVob8FMT6Rk,10392800,10398240,amendment the second amendment we know  those uh but the unenumerated rights  well we have to have a framework for
UVob8FMT6Rk,10398240,10404479,deciding those and centuries ago there  was a debate over whether is there is a  constitutional right to contract to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10404479,10409600,enter into contracts and to earn a  living the court gave the right then it  took it back and that's kind of where
UVob8FMT6Rk,10409600,10415439,things stand today so the court has done  that before but it is exceedingly rare
UVob8FMT6Rk,10415439,10421840,now it's taking away one of the rights  that sort of began with the warren court  in the postmodern era as the warren
UVob8FMT6Rk,10421840,10428720,court recognized substantive due process  rights these unenumerated rights  relatively regularly and the rehnquist
UVob8FMT6Rk,10428720,10435760,court never really reeled them in  chloe you've been covering issues around  abortion for for several years now as
UVob8FMT6Rk,10435760,10441359,you look at this decision what does this  change in roe v wade  mean for america what does the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,10441359,10448479,look like as a result of this now that's  right aaron this is a watershed moment  in american history with roe v wade no
UVob8FMT6Rk,10448479,10455439,longer the law of the land states will  now have the freedom to regulate  abortion as they please so what that
UVob8FMT6Rk,10455439,10461359,means is huge parts and swathes of the  south and midwest will highly restrict
UVob8FMT6Rk,10461359,10466640,or ban abortion altogether and that  means liberal leaning and coastal states
UVob8FMT6Rk,10466640,10473439,will now be dubbed abortion safe haven  states where people if they can afford  to do so they will be able to travel
UVob8FMT6Rk,10473439,10480240,there to obtain care but i want to  underscore that not everyone has the  means to travel out of state for care
UVob8FMT6Rk,10480240,10486800,you know typically the procedure cost a  couple hundred dollars and most  americans don't have a couple hundred
UVob8FMT6Rk,10486800,10493600,dollars in emergency funds at their  hands so we're going to see people being  forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10493600,10499680,term or they will self-manage their  abortion likely using medication  abortion aaron
UVob8FMT6Rk,10499680,10505120,and in some cases you talk about  self-managed the part of the fear has  been that that would mean people getting
UVob8FMT6Rk,10505120,10511680,doing unsafe things to to to  to get to have an abortion right and i  want to really highlight that we are in
UVob8FMT6Rk,10511680,10517920,a different place than we were in a  pre-roe v wade era there has been um you
UVob8FMT6Rk,10517920,10525359,know  huge  you know changes in science medication  now we have medication abortion which is
UVob8FMT6Rk,10525359,10533200,highly effective which is highly safe  and so what we will see you know within  this self-managed realm is women looking
UVob8FMT6Rk,10533200,10538560,online to buy medication there um you  know either traveling to places like
UVob8FMT6Rk,10538560,10543840,mexico i interviewed a woman named emma  who was able to get medication abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,10543840,10549760,from a friend who traveled to mexico  while sba texas six-week ban was in
UVob8FMT6Rk,10549760,10556880,effect in february and march of this  year and she was able to terminate her  own pregnancy successfully and safely
UVob8FMT6Rk,10556880,10562800,within her home we're going to talk a  little bit more about mexico in a second  danny i do want to ask you something  chloe sort of referenced here 13 states
UVob8FMT6Rk,10562800,10568399,are going to have what we call trigger  laws in place now meaning that  when roe v wade if and when it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,10568399,10575760,overturned those trigger laws would go  into effect what's happening in those  states right now as as the reality now
UVob8FMT6Rk,10575760,10581760,is is sinking in what actions are being  taken if any or is it automatic in some  of these places in some of them it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,10581760,10587760,automatic i believe michigan is an  example that as of today those laws are  reanimated like zombies i mean they've
UVob8FMT6Rk,10587760,10592880,been called zombie laws in some  instances they are now in effect and
UVob8FMT6Rk,10592880,10597920,what's interesting though is that people  need to understand that  the case the decision today doesn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,10597920,10603600,actually outlaw abortion anywhere it  just returns that power to the state and
UVob8FMT6Rk,10603600,10608640,abortion may be protected in some states  under the state constitution kansas for
UVob8FMT6Rk,10608640,10615040,example i believe has recognized a state  constitutional right to an abortion  although iowa just last week their
UVob8FMT6Rk,10615040,10622640,supreme court uh declined to recognize  or said or turned around and said no our  state constitution does not recognize a
UVob8FMT6Rk,10622640,10628880,right to abortion so there may still be  right constitutional rights to abortion  that exist in the states and just one
UVob8FMT6Rk,10628880,10635359,other thing with chloe's terrific  reporting you know the next battleground  the next battlefront in this uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,10635359,10642399,litigation is going to be states extra  territorial jurisdiction the power to  prosecute people who leave their states
UVob8FMT6Rk,10642399,10649680,so if you're a resident of one state and  you go to another state to obtain an  abortion can your home state criminalize
UVob8FMT6Rk,10649680,10654720,your conduct and before you know the  snap reaction to that might be well wait  a state can't criminalize anything
UVob8FMT6Rk,10654720,10660479,outside its jurisdiction states do that  all the time conspiracy laws allow  states to reach out and criminalize
UVob8FMT6Rk,10660479,10666479,things that happened outside the state  good example would be in the state of  georgia let's just say a president calls
UVob8FMT6Rk,10666479,10672479,in from out of georgia and bothers the  secretary of state that could  potentially be a crime and potentially
UVob8FMT6Rk,10672479,10679200,georgia could reach beyond the state of  georgia and criminalize a phone call  made into georgia so that is the next uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,10679200,10684399,the next front in this battle i think  we'll have a chance to talk a little bit  more about that i'm going to ask danny  and chloe to stick with us here as we
UVob8FMT6Rk,10684399,10690319,continue our coverage i want to bring in  uh tally farhadian weinstein now she's  an nbc news legal analyst and a former
UVob8FMT6Rk,10690319,10697359,prosecutor here in new york tally first  i just want to get your reaction to the  decision today it wasn't an unexpected
UVob8FMT6Rk,10697359,10704800,decision  but what are your thoughts as we look at  the reality now of this decision from  the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,10704800,10711200,this decision is absolute and it is  aggressive it knifes roe v wade it kicks
UVob8FMT6Rk,10711200,10717439,the dead body of roe v wade it pours  gasoline on it and sets it a fire and  you know there
UVob8FMT6Rk,10717439,10723840,importantly there were two sort of  softer more gentler routes that the  court could have taken
UVob8FMT6Rk,10723840,10728880,and chose not to one was  the option that chief justice roberts
UVob8FMT6Rk,10728880,10736000,gave and his concurrence where he said  we don't have to go this far we can  today uphold the mississippi 15 week
UVob8FMT6Rk,10736000,10741439,band and leave some of these other  questions for later  the court rejected that and it also
UVob8FMT6Rk,10741439,10746800,inside of its opinion it rejected the  idea that when people have been relying
UVob8FMT6Rk,10746800,10752640,on a right that was established by the  supreme court for so long that
UVob8FMT6Rk,10752640,10759520,that reliance councils going a little  bit slower and thinking about how much
UVob8FMT6Rk,10759520,10767279,instability uh and chaos this creates in  people's lives  this decision as the dissent says makes
UVob8FMT6Rk,10767279,10772319,it possible for states and for the  federal government if it wishes to do so
UVob8FMT6Rk,10772319,10781200,congress to ban abortion from the moment  of fertilization  no matter how young the pregnant girl
UVob8FMT6Rk,10781200,10787840,or woman no matter the circumstances of  the pregnancy  no matter how wanted or unwanted the
UVob8FMT6Rk,10787840,10793439,pregnancy is rape incest timeline there  is just absolutely
UVob8FMT6Rk,10793439,10800240,nothing to take the edge off what the  supreme court has decided you know in  states where abortion is either now or
UVob8FMT6Rk,10800240,10806479,will be banned it can be investigated as  a crime what level of policing would you
UVob8FMT6Rk,10806479,10811760,would you think women could face or  abortion providers could face
UVob8FMT6Rk,10811760,10818960,it's an excellent and important question  you know historically in the anti-choice  community there has been some hesitation
UVob8FMT6Rk,10818960,10826560,about going after  the pregnant woman who obtains the  abortion rather than on the provider
UVob8FMT6Rk,10826560,10832160,and in in lots of the early cases the  focus was really on the doctors often
UVob8FMT6Rk,10832160,10837600,male doctors and some of the abortion  specific statutes were written to focus
UVob8FMT6Rk,10837600,10843359,on them and the crime that they are  committing we're in a different place  right now i mean for one thing more than
UVob8FMT6Rk,10843359,10849920,half of abortions in this country are  now obtained through medication so there  really isn't a provider present in
UVob8FMT6Rk,10849920,10857600,performing the abortion  in the way that you know we thought when  a decision like roe came down and this
UVob8FMT6Rk,10857600,10864160,does as you say put the focus on what  police and prosecutors are going to do  are they going to use
UVob8FMT6Rk,10864160,10869520,their sort of all-purpose laws on murder  assault attempt to go after both
UVob8FMT6Rk,10869520,10874560,providers and the women who obtain  abortions and conversely and you know  here's
UVob8FMT6Rk,10874560,10880640,a i guess a glimmer of hope if you want  to call it that  there are 3 700 elected prosecutors
UVob8FMT6Rk,10880640,10885920,around the country and i think that  an issue now in many of their elections
UVob8FMT6Rk,10885920,10891520,will be what are you going to do  are you going to enforce these laws and  are you going to enforce them to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,10891520,10897040,maximum you know a prosecutor could say  for example that even though uh in her
UVob8FMT6Rk,10897040,10903120,jurisdiction  abortion is completely illegal under  every circumstance that she would never
UVob8FMT6Rk,10903120,10908479,bring a prosecution in the case of rape  or incest that can be a campaign pledge
UVob8FMT6Rk,10908479,10914160,and i do think we're going to start to  see some activity there  particularly in the absence of major
UVob8FMT6Rk,10914160,10920800,changes in legislation to protect the  right where it is not protected anymore  in your mind does this ruling on
UVob8FMT6Rk,10920800,10928240,abortion potentially throw other rights  into question do you think that this may  not end with uh abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,10928240,10934160,well you know the court uh says that  there the the whole logic of how roby
UVob8FMT6Rk,10934160,10941680,roe v wade came about by finding a  substantive right in the due process  clause to privacy uh just doesn't work
UVob8FMT6Rk,10941680,10948160,and to answer your question we have to  look at how justice thomas and his  concurrence and how the dissent react to
UVob8FMT6Rk,10948160,10955600,that reasoning of the decision justice  thomas says explicitly let's keep going  on the same logic i'd like to look at
UVob8FMT6Rk,10955600,10963439,griswold uh which is about contraception  obergefell which is about same-sex  marriage uh and so his answer to your
UVob8FMT6Rk,10963439,10970319,question is yes and what the dissent  says is pretty much the same thing it  says if you're going to really abide by
UVob8FMT6Rk,10970319,10976960,this logic then other rights are  vulnerable and if you're going to say no  they're not this is just about abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,10976960,10982960,and abortion is different then it  actually uses the word hypocritical to  describe the majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,10982960,10988240,all right tally farhadian weinstein we  appreciate your time and your  perspective on this historic day thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,10988240,10993279,you  now the supreme court's decision on roe  v wade this morning will end 50 years of
UVob8FMT6Rk,10993279,11001561,federal abortion rights as we've been  saying so how did we end up here nbc's  hallie jackson has this look back
UVob8FMT6Rk,11002080,11009120,[Applause]  for 50 years it's been the flash point
UVob8FMT6Rk,11009120,11014960,at the center of american politics  when you have an abortion you're
UVob8FMT6Rk,11014960,11020880,murdering your own child we're not going  to be pushed back into a period of back  alley abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,11020880,11028160,and the case that loomed over every  supreme court nomination battle do you  expect to overrule the roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,11028160,11035600,supreme court decision i don't think it  would be  proper for me to answer that something  central to a woman's
UVob8FMT6Rk,11035600,11042240,life it's been reaffirmed many times all  supreme court cases are presidential
UVob8FMT6Rk,11042240,11047680,in 1970 a pregnant norma mccorvey known  as jane roe to protect her identity
UVob8FMT6Rk,11047680,11054479,filed a class action suit against the  district attorney of dallas county texas  henry wade the suit took aim at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11054479,11061040,existing abortion ban in texas that only  allowed a pregnancy to be terminated to  save a woman's life the united states
UVob8FMT6Rk,11061040,11067040,supreme court it handed down a historic  decision about abortion in 1973 the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11067040,11074640,court ruled in roe's favor in a 7-2  decision the freedom to have an abortion  is now legal in every state declaring
UVob8FMT6Rk,11074640,11080160,abortion as a constitutional right  citing in part a personal right to  privacy
UVob8FMT6Rk,11080160,11086240,it stopped states from banning the  procedure before fetal viability the  point in a pregnancy when a fetus can
UVob8FMT6Rk,11086240,11093600,survive outside the womb  after the ruling the number of reported  abortions rose across the nation from 14
UVob8FMT6Rk,11093600,11099760,legal abortions per every thousand women  in 1973 to a high of 25 legal abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,11099760,11108000,per every thousand women in 1980  according to the cdc the most recent  reporting from 2019 shows more than 629
UVob8FMT6Rk,11108000,11113279,thousand legal abortions that year  roe v wade radically transformed the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11113279,11119040,political landscape  the two opposing sides in the abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,11119040,11124960,rights debate  growing into powerful political  movements
UVob8FMT6Rk,11124960,11131680,as recently as 2020 a gallup poll found  one in four americans considered  abortion to be a key voting issue the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11131680,11138240,topic playing a part in every major  presidential election of the last 40  years what single issue could say more
UVob8FMT6Rk,11138240,11143359,about a society's values this difficult  and painful decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,11143359,11149600,should be left to the women have a  god-given right  to life i support a woman's right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,11149600,11155920,choose over the years the supreme court  approved restrictions that chipped away  at roe versus wade including limits on
UVob8FMT6Rk,11155920,11163120,abortion procedures for ultrasound exams  and counseling but the constitutional  right to abortion remained for nearly 50
UVob8FMT6Rk,11163120,11168640,years  now as we cross the bottom of the hour  here we continue to stay on top of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11168640,11175200,breaking news the supreme court's  landmark decision to overturn roe v wade  president biden spoke about that ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,11175200,11180399,last hour let's listen to part of what  he said  it's a sad day for the court and for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11180399,11187279,country  50 years ago  roe v wade  was decided and has been the law of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11187279,11192560,land since then  this landmark case protected woman's  right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,11192560,11198720,her right to make intensely personal  decisions with her doctor  free from the entertainment from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11198720,11204080,interference of politics  it reaffirmed basic principles of  equality
UVob8FMT6Rk,11204080,11209359,that women have the power to control  their own destiny  and it reinforced a fundamental right of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11209359,11216160,privacy  the right of each of us to choose how to  live our lives
UVob8FMT6Rk,11216160,11222399,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,11222399,11228080,nation  are now at risk  nbc news correspondent josh letterman
UVob8FMT6Rk,11228080,11233600,joins us from the white house now josh  we just heard a little bit of what the  president had to say in his remarks
UVob8FMT6Rk,11233600,11241359,today what else did he touch on in his  comments  well the president tried to use these  remarks today aaron to really capture
UVob8FMT6Rk,11241359,11248000,the sense of frustration  outrage and even dismay that so many  people across the country including so
UVob8FMT6Rk,11248000,11254160,many of his supporters are feeling today  president biden calling it a sad day not  only for the court but also for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11254160,11260399,country saying that the life and health  of women are now in jeopardy and nobody
UVob8FMT6Rk,11260399,11267439,more he said than women of color who he  said would be disproportionately  disadvantaged by this ruling but the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11267439,11274399,president also used these remarks to try  to lay the groundwork for the federal  government to take action where it can
UVob8FMT6Rk,11274399,11280560,to try to preserve access to abortion  for as many women as possible and he was  very forthright with the fact that
UVob8FMT6Rk,11280560,11287200,there's nothing sweeping the president  can sign an executive order or something  that will restore a right that the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11287200,11293600,supreme court has just said is not  constitutionally protected he can't undo  what the supreme court did today but
UVob8FMT6Rk,11293600,11299120,what the administration can do is try  around the edges to strictly enforce
UVob8FMT6Rk,11299120,11305840,some of the existing laws to help  facilitate women maintaining access to  abortion where they can so for example
UVob8FMT6Rk,11305840,11311840,he talked about the justice department  making sure that women who want to cross  state lines to seek an abortion in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11311840,11318720,state where it will remain legal have  the ability to do that and they're not  infringed upon as they seek that access
UVob8FMT6Rk,11318720,11324000,and similarly with access to abortion  pills making sure that states know that
UVob8FMT6Rk,11324000,11329279,they cannot simply throw out the science  of the fda which has said that those
UVob8FMT6Rk,11329279,11335760,medications are safe and effective the  president though acknowledging that  ultimately this is something that needs
UVob8FMT6Rk,11335760,11340880,to be codified into law if the  fundamental right that had existed until
UVob8FMT6Rk,11340880,11346560,now uh is to be brought back aaron you  talk about things being codified into  law josh the president sort of used part
UVob8FMT6Rk,11346560,11351840,of this speech to to kind of rally  voters as we go into the midterms right  what was his message along those lines
UVob8FMT6Rk,11351840,11357600,to voters  yeah a rallying caller i think it was  even a call to action by the president
UVob8FMT6Rk,11357600,11364479,in a political sense which was fairly  unusual to hear the president explicitly  talking about elections and who people
UVob8FMT6Rk,11364479,11370239,should vote for while speaking in the  cross hall of the white house a place  where the president will often give
UVob8FMT6Rk,11370239,11375279,presidential addresses on weighty topics  of peace and war but the president
UVob8FMT6Rk,11375279,11381760,making very clear that if people want  the reality to be different than it is  after this decision they've got to go
UVob8FMT6Rk,11381760,11388399,out in november and elect lawmakers  who will support those policies  president biden saying that this is not
UVob8FMT6Rk,11388399,11394000,over and that you can have the final  word here and so we expect this to be a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11394000,11399439,key part of the message the president  will be carrying on to the campaign  trail as he starts to campaign for
UVob8FMT6Rk,11399439,11404800,democrats in the midterm elections and  the key  argument the president wants to leave
UVob8FMT6Rk,11404800,11410880,people with is that this is not a done  deal that there is still some hope if  people remain engaged in the political
UVob8FMT6Rk,11410880,11417359,process for lawmakers to restore these  rights in the future  all right josh lederman for us outside
UVob8FMT6Rk,11417359,11422560,the white house today josh thank you i  want to go to nbc news capitol hill  correspondent ali raffa now on some
UVob8FMT6Rk,11422560,11428720,breaking news a major story we're  following this hour  the house vote on that bipartisan
UVob8FMT6Rk,11428720,11434880,gun legislation allie i understand  there's been some movement there in the  house walk us through it
UVob8FMT6Rk,11434880,11440479,some major movement erin because  as of just a couple minutes ago we have
UVob8FMT6Rk,11440479,11447279,found out that this this has actually  passed this historic deal of gun reform  just passed on the house floor with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11447279,11452880,total of 14 republicans voting with  democrats crossing party lines to vote
UVob8FMT6Rk,11452880,11458160,with democrats in favor of this we had  estimated around a dozen or so of them
UVob8FMT6Rk,11458160,11465680,to do so and they have including two  representatives from  buffalo new york and uvalde texas those
UVob8FMT6Rk,11465680,11471200,the latest two cities that unfortunately  had  such tragic mass shootings in the last
UVob8FMT6Rk,11471200,11479520,few months and that's really what got  the ball rolling on this effort we saw  just four weeks of negotiations a deal
UVob8FMT6Rk,11479520,11485120,come out of these negotiations after  nearly a decade of failed gun reforms
UVob8FMT6Rk,11485120,11491840,nearly 30 years since we've seen gun  reform this large so this is coming  actually exactly one month to the day
UVob8FMT6Rk,11491840,11497600,since the oval day shooting  aaron i want to turn back to the uh roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,11497600,11503359,v wade decision that came from the court  uh this morning ali if we can speaker  pelosi has said that republicans in
UVob8FMT6Rk,11503359,11510640,congress are planning a nationwide ban  on abortion how serious are those  discussions and how much of an appetite
UVob8FMT6Rk,11510640,11517760,does there seem to be for that in the  gop caucus  well this has really struck a capitol
UVob8FMT6Rk,11517760,11524239,hill uh very very hard today you know  you have democrats some of whom we have  spoken with have had abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,11524239,11530080,themselves really impacted by this  overwhelmed by this news and then you  have republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,11530080,11535520,most of them saying that this is really  the first step in making abortions uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,11535520,11541120,illegal nationwide so the reaction here  on capitol hill has really differed  today
UVob8FMT6Rk,11541120,11546239,obviously this was something that  lawmakers were expecting after we saw  that draft opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,11546239,11552720,leak a few months ago now and so  democrats were trying to shore up some  support some possible action on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,11552720,11558080,but we know the votes weren't there we  saw that vote back in may to possibly
UVob8FMT6Rk,11558080,11563840,codify row into a federal law that was a  vote that senators knew would fail  because they didn't have the votes but
UVob8FMT6Rk,11563840,11570319,it was really an opportunity to get all  lawmakers on the record with where they  stood on reproductive rights and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,11570319,11576479,today we're seeing the same thing with  just a swarm of reaction from lawmakers  here on capitol hill
UVob8FMT6Rk,11576479,11583279,really impacted by this decision we  heard from nancy pelosi  this morning in a very emotional speech
UVob8FMT6Rk,11583279,11589200,this morning take a listen to a part of  that  this morning the radical supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,11589200,11595520,is eviscerating americans rights and  endangering their health and safety the  republican-controlled supreme court has
UVob8FMT6Rk,11595520,11601600,achieved their dark  extreme goal of ripping away a woman's
UVob8FMT6Rk,11601600,11608239,right to make  their own dis reproductive health  decisions american women today have less
UVob8FMT6Rk,11608239,11613279,freedom than their mothers what this  means to women is such an insult
UVob8FMT6Rk,11613279,11618800,it's a slap in the face to women about  using their own judgment
UVob8FMT6Rk,11618800,11625680,to make their own decisions  about their reproductive freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,11626080,11631200,we also saw lawmakers reminisce on  senate judiciary hearings for
UVob8FMT6Rk,11631200,11637120,supreme court justices  gorsuch and kavanaugh really looking  back to what they told them
UVob8FMT6Rk,11637120,11643279,specifically senator joe manchin saying  he's quote disappointed saying he  trusted these two justices when they
UVob8FMT6Rk,11643279,11649200,said that roe was precedent and safe and  couldn't be changed  republican senator susan collins who
UVob8FMT6Rk,11649200,11655840,voted for both of these supreme court  justices saying she's a quote ill this  decision was quote ill-considered and
UVob8FMT6Rk,11655840,11663359,inconsistent with what they told her  during those hearings and so really just  an influx of reaction from capitol hill
UVob8FMT6Rk,11663359,11670319,actually before this gun vote we saw  over 100 lawmakers marched from the  house floor over to the supreme court if
UVob8FMT6Rk,11670319,11677040,you're familiar with the layout of  capitol hill here it's really just a  block away  going there making speeches on the steps
UVob8FMT6Rk,11677040,11684080,of the supreme court here everyone here  impacted by this decision from lawmakers  to staffers we have even heard of some
UVob8FMT6Rk,11684080,11690960,staffers given the permission by their  bosses to leave capitol hill early  capital police really
UVob8FMT6Rk,11690960,11697600,boosting security here as well as even  tourists here who were on tours today  all tours being stopped for the rest of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11697600,11703840,the day because of this decision erin we  know d.c police are on heightened alert  as are some of the surrounding  jurisdictions as a result of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,11703840,11710399,decision ali rafa for us on the hill  today allie thank you i want to turn  back to our guests here in studio nbc
UVob8FMT6Rk,11710399,11716960,news legal analyst danny cevallos and  chloe atkins one of our investigative  reporters here chloe i want to start  with you looking at some of the data
UVob8FMT6Rk,11716960,11723439,that that we've been able to gather on  this it was a recent nbc news poll that  showed a combined 60 of americans say
UVob8FMT6Rk,11723439,11730319,abortion should be either always legal  or legal most of the time  how consistent have those numbers been
UVob8FMT6Rk,11730319,11738000,in the recent polling that we've been  looking at  right so a majority of americans do  support abortion while about 40 percent
UVob8FMT6Rk,11738000,11744239,do not and so you know we have seen this  shift in support and you know i also you
UVob8FMT6Rk,11744239,11749760,know despite this ruling you know there  is that support but i also do want to  plug that i got off the phone not too
UVob8FMT6Rk,11749760,11756000,long ago with a source from the american  um united for life who said that this um
UVob8FMT6Rk,11756000,11763040,he now feels very euphoric and this is a  monumental moment for the anti-abortion  movement now i also talked to an
UVob8FMT6Rk,11763040,11768239,abortion provider who is located in new  york and she said you know this was
UVob8FMT6Rk,11768239,11774080,expected but it was a huge gut punch and  they are now anticipating an influx of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11774080,11779840,patients any day now yeah danny as we  look at this reality around  some of these numbers right 60 of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11779840,11785120,americans support abortion rights  what does a decision like this do for
UVob8FMT6Rk,11785120,11791200,the authority the reputation of the  court to have made a decision that  seemed to be so out of touch with the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11791200,11796640,majority of the citizenry well if i were  to put on my imaginary conservative hat  for the conservative block of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11796640,11802800,supreme court i think they might respond  to those poll numbers with well then  great if the majority of americans
UVob8FMT6Rk,11802800,11808800,support abortion then it should be no  problem they go to the polls and this  issue has now been returned to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11808800,11814960,states in fact it's the conservative  block of the supreme court that has long  said the problem with recognizing rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,11814960,11821840,it feels good to say hey you have a  constitutional right but at its core  it's nine humans who are appointed not
UVob8FMT6Rk,11821840,11829040,elected who are making these decisions  and taking away those same decisions  from the people from the states and one
UVob8FMT6Rk,11829040,11836160,of the things alido pointed out is that  mississippis mississippi's constituency  is majority female so this is arguably a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11836160,11841279,decision uh in the legislature that was  supported by a majority feel female
UVob8FMT6Rk,11841279,11847040,constituency so the thing about poll  numbers and the thing about picketing  out in front of the supreme court is
UVob8FMT6Rk,11847040,11854479,that  civics lessons teach you the supreme  court is the last institution it's  designed to not care about pickets polls
UVob8FMT6Rk,11854479,11860080,or anything else we appoint our justices  for life they sit as long as they can on
UVob8FMT6Rk,11860080,11866000,good behavior unless they get impeached  and so for that reason we did that for a  very specific reason because our framers
UVob8FMT6Rk,11866000,11873120,hated royalty but they did this so that  the justices would not care about  outside pressures and now do they anyway
UVob8FMT6Rk,11873120,11878399,who knows there's a lot of talk about  ginny thomas and clarence thomas and  maybe a a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11878399,11884880,realm of influence there but that  remains to be seen but the bottom line  is if the poll numbers are what they are
UVob8FMT6Rk,11884880,11890399,then i think the conservative side of  the supreme court would say fantastic if  that's the case then they should go to
UVob8FMT6Rk,11890399,11896000,the actual polls and this wouldn't be a  problem now the reality is you have  population clusters in different states
UVob8FMT6Rk,11896000,11902800,and a state like mississippi maybe  that's not uh possible but you know  under principles of federalism this
UVob8FMT6Rk,11902800,11908800,if by this should create a situation  where states that are doing something  that is not desirable to the majority of
UVob8FMT6Rk,11908800,11914800,people in this country well you vote  with your wallet you leave you move to a  state that does what you like with your
UVob8FMT6Rk,11914800,11920800,tax dollars in theory the reality is not  everybody has the money to get a covered  wagon or a u-haul right and move to a
UVob8FMT6Rk,11920800,11927279,state where uh abortion is legal so i i  we sort of put this question to tally  for haiti nyc a minute ago where does
UVob8FMT6Rk,11927279,11934000,this go from here do you think are are  some of the other things that we look as  look at as rights now at risk do we
UVob8FMT6Rk,11934000,11940960,think that this court is going to  to sort of target some of those things  in conservative decisions going forward
UVob8FMT6Rk,11940960,11946239,uh maybe an hour ago i would have argued  for no but i saw what i think is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11946239,11951279,biggest blockbuster line is in justice  thomas's uh opinion now that's not the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11951279,11958960,majority it's a concurring but he says  essentially we should revisit  obergefell we should revisit marriage
UVob8FMT6Rk,11958960,11965439,yes exactly we should revisit the right  to contraception we should revisit  lawrence v texas uh which struck down
UVob8FMT6Rk,11965439,11970720,sodomy laws that is breathtaking and  that is really quietly the biggest
UVob8FMT6Rk,11970720,11976880,blockbuster in this opinion almost  everything else we knew almost  everything else we had a hint at oral
UVob8FMT6Rk,11976880,11982239,argument was going to go this way  including robert's concurrence but the  idea that we would revisit all the
UVob8FMT6Rk,11982239,11989279,substantive due process cases  is particularly unnerving because alito  goes to such great lengths to say no no
UVob8FMT6Rk,11989279,11996560,no uh abortion is what we call sewage  generous that's fancy latin for unique  you should just say unique because it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,11996560,12003040,the only right that involves the taking  away of a potential life which is  language from rho uh it is different
UVob8FMT6Rk,12003040,12008880,from all of the other rights and the  other reason being reliance some of  these others obergefell is a great
UVob8FMT6Rk,12008880,12015359,example if you overrule obergefell  people have been relying families  are relying on a burst you would undo
UVob8FMT6Rk,12015359,12020960,fact i mean i can't imagine the court  doing that and i can't imagine that  thomas would say that you can conclude
UVob8FMT6Rk,12020960,12027279,that obergefell may have been wrongly  decided but that's a case for example  that has really tremendous reliance
UVob8FMT6Rk,12027279,12032319,interest that's a classic example of the  entire country has relied on that and
UVob8FMT6Rk,12032319,12038080,built families around a berger fell  whether or not you agree that it was  right or wrongly decided the argument
UVob8FMT6Rk,12038080,12045040,with roe and casey is that the reliance  isn't really there it's prospective it  looks to the future unless it happens
UVob8FMT6Rk,12045040,12050560,you know it came down today and someone  needed an abortion today otherwise it's  a future kind of reliance all right
UVob8FMT6Rk,12050560,12057840,danny cevallos chloe atkins i'll ask you  guys to stick with us if you can here we  want to turn to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12059600,12064800,uh all right control room help me out  here um  this is dr
UVob8FMT6Rk,12064800,12070319,dr jamila uh parrot who is president and  ceo of physicians for reproductive
UVob8FMT6Rk,12070319,12075439,health she's also an ob gyn and an  abortion provider in washington dc uh dr
UVob8FMT6Rk,12075439,12081439,perry we appreciate you being here today  i want to ask you first just you know  what went through your mind uh when that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12081439,12087760,decision came down from the supreme  court today on roe v wade  thank you so much for for having me um
UVob8FMT6Rk,12087760,12094000,it's a devastating ruling and it's going  to have long  term generational impacts for
UVob8FMT6Rk,12094000,12100560,individuals for our families for our  communities but it wasn't something that  was surprising to any of us who have
UVob8FMT6Rk,12100560,12106800,been providing abortion care for any  amount of time in this country access to  abortion has been under attack for
UVob8FMT6Rk,12106800,12112160,decades this is a devastating blow and  it's one of many that we have seen play
UVob8FMT6Rk,12112160,12118080,out since the passage of roe in 1973.  so abortion remains legal where where
UVob8FMT6Rk,12118080,12125200,you are how are providers like you  preparing to be able to continue to do  your work to deliver care in a post-role
UVob8FMT6Rk,12125200,12132000,environment  let me say you know to your first point  about abortion being legal where i am  i'm actually a resident of washington
UVob8FMT6Rk,12132000,12137120,d.c and we do not have home rule so how  long abortion will remain legal in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,12137120,12143040,district is up to congressional ruling  because we are not a state in terms of  providers that are living in states
UVob8FMT6Rk,12143040,12149760,where abortion is codified into their  constitution or they have been made  legal or or proactive legislation has
UVob8FMT6Rk,12149760,12154960,been passed to ensure access to abortion  we are going to see a huge influx of
UVob8FMT6Rk,12154960,12161520,people who are traveling seeking this  care the truth is that whether abortion  is illegal or not where you live
UVob8FMT6Rk,12161520,12167439,abortions continue and so people who can  travel will travel but most people many
UVob8FMT6Rk,12167439,12173760,people who are going to be most  disproportionately impacted by this  legislation will not be able to do so
UVob8FMT6Rk,12173760,12179359,and so what are your concerns then about  how this ruling is going to impact the  physical health of women
UVob8FMT6Rk,12179359,12186160,we have very clear evidence that when  folks are seeking abortion care and it  is denied that there are long-term
UVob8FMT6Rk,12186160,12194000,health and and emotional and economic  impacts for individuals and also for our  families we know that mortality rates
UVob8FMT6Rk,12194000,12200160,maternal mortality rates increase and  for black women who are three to four  more times likely to die during
UVob8FMT6Rk,12200160,12206080,pregnancy and in the postpartum period  than white women this will have a clear  detrimental effect on our maternal
UVob8FMT6Rk,12206080,12212800,mortality we know that it has long  reaching economic impacts folks who are  denied abortion care are more likely to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12212800,12218960,either be thrust into or remain in  poverty more likely to be tied to an  abusive partner so there are the
UVob8FMT6Rk,12218960,12225120,implications for years to come in  generations to come in fact are going to  be far-reaching
UVob8FMT6Rk,12225120,12231680,all right dr jamila parrott we  appreciate your time and your  perspective today helping us to  understand from the medical side of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,12231680,12237680,uh how this decision is going to impact  people in this country thank you dr  perry  thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,12237680,12243520,now 13 states have trigger laws in place  as we've noted today you see those  states on your screen here that means
UVob8FMT6Rk,12243520,12248720,abortions will be banned in these places  now that roe v wade has been overturned
UVob8FMT6Rk,12248720,12255359,nbc news correspondent cal perry is live  in one of those states he's in missouri  for us today in st louis uh cal the
UVob8FMT6Rk,12255359,12261520,attorney general there in missouri made  that state's abortion ban official a  little while ago walk us through that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12261520,12268399,what more do we know about it  yes so we think that missouri then  became officially the first state uh in
UVob8FMT6Rk,12268399,12274160,the united states to make abortion  illegal i'm gonna get out of the way and  let rich show you the scene here we've  had people showing up here uh this
UVob8FMT6Rk,12274160,12280479,morning on both sides of the issue we  have uh pro-choice individuals and  provides individuals at times um they
UVob8FMT6Rk,12280479,12285920,are facing off it is calm at this moment  but back to sort of what happened here  this morning so the attorney general in
UVob8FMT6Rk,12285920,12291920,the state basically codifying that  supreme court decision the state of  missouri passed in 2019 what is called
UVob8FMT6Rk,12291920,12297040,that trigger law that you mentioned  which is to say as soon as the supreme  court overturned roe v wade all that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12297040,12302319,needed to happen was either the attorney  general for the state of missouri or the  governor in the state of missouri had to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12302319,12308080,make that proclamation and then it would  become illegal and again that happened  this morning and so our viewers know it
UVob8FMT6Rk,12308080,12314640,is now a class b felony here in the  state so it can come with a penalty of 5  to 15 years in prison now local
UVob8FMT6Rk,12314640,12321200,representatives want women especially  who were looking for this care or maybe  had an appointment here this weekend and  we should say the reason the crowd is
UVob8FMT6Rk,12321200,12326560,here is that this planned parenthood is  the only location in missouri where  women could receive an abortion and that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12326560,12332560,was true before this ruling so local  officials congressman bush for example  who represents this district wants women
UVob8FMT6Rk,12332560,12337840,to know in this state they can still go  to illinois if they had an appointment  this weekend they go to illinois but it
UVob8FMT6Rk,12337840,12343680,is instructive of what has happened  today the historic nature of this  decision and how things are going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12343680,12350080,immediately change around this country  certainly in those 13 states where you  have that trigger law like missouri
UVob8FMT6Rk,12350080,12356080,abortion is now officially illegal  i i do want to ask you too cal about the  scene that's developed around you there
UVob8FMT6Rk,12356080,12362720,what's been the reaction from from  people there in missouri since this  ruling came down
UVob8FMT6Rk,12362800,12369920,well look the pro-life movement and you  see here in missouri it's a powerful  movement the right to life movement in  missouri is a powerful movement the
UVob8FMT6Rk,12369920,12376399,public action committee right to life um  has a lot of sway in this state and  certainly for pro-life people today is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,12376399,12381439,big day and it's an important day and  they're saying that they are celebrating  it we've heard people honking um and
UVob8FMT6Rk,12381439,12386960,yelling sort of support here uh to the  pro-life crowd now just sort of down the  sidewalk and risk could come and i don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,12386960,12393200,mean to turn my back but we can try to  make our way through the crowd uh you  have pro-choice individuals who came out  here this morning they actually saw us
UVob8FMT6Rk,12393200,12398960,on tv and came out here it's a smaller  group they're laying here sort of  sitting here against the fence um and
UVob8FMT6Rk,12398960,12405120,we've been talking to them and they're  incredibly depressed about what has  happened there is a shock here i think  amongst a lot of people and when you
UVob8FMT6Rk,12405120,12411840,talk to women across this country um it  is worth reporting that there is a great  deal of fair of fear as well in that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12411840,12417840,community and certainly when i spoke to  representative cory bush she spoke to  that she spoke to the fear that is  amongst women because here in a state
UVob8FMT6Rk,12417840,12424239,like missouri which is a very  conservative state has a conservative  state government here there's a concern  amongst groups like planned parenthood
UVob8FMT6Rk,12424239,12430880,that birth control could be next birth  control is still legal in the state of  missouri we need to be clear about that  but there is a concern that there are
UVob8FMT6Rk,12430880,12436479,other laws other freedoms as planned  parenthood would say it that could be  coming under threat aaron
UVob8FMT6Rk,12436479,12442080,all right cal perry for us in missouri  today cal thank you we appreciate your  reporting there i want to bring in nbc
UVob8FMT6Rk,12442080,12448800,news reporter julie sirkin now for more  on this landmark supreme court ruling on  abortion rights she is at the capitol
UVob8FMT6Rk,12448800,12455680,for us as well today uh julie i know you  recently spoke to a mother and daughter  who both have had abortions uh decades
UVob8FMT6Rk,12455680,12461920,apart one before row the other during  role what did they tell you about their  experiences
UVob8FMT6Rk,12461920,12467520,erin sammy destro and her mother patti  had abortions 47 years apart and i spoke
UVob8FMT6Rk,12467520,12474319,to sammy who had the unique experience  of being able to openly speak with her  mother about their abortion experiences
UVob8FMT6Rk,12474319,12480479,take a listen  i was 19 or 20 when i had an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,12480479,12487040,and i was 25 when i had an abortion  patty detzer had an abortion five years  before the supreme court's landmark
UVob8FMT6Rk,12487040,12495200,ruling legally protecting a woman's  right to choose they told me  to get an abortion i had to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,12495200,12502319,to have a legal abortion i had to see  three shrinks  i do remember by the time i was finished
UVob8FMT6Rk,12502319,12508800,with that you know i felt like  i really am crazy  her daughter sami found out she was
UVob8FMT6Rk,12508800,12515439,pregnant in 2015. a year later the two  of them interviewed each other on a  local radio show so
UVob8FMT6Rk,12515439,12522160,i went and i bought a pregnancy test  before work one morning and this one  came out positive the two women's
UVob8FMT6Rk,12522160,12528160,experiences could not have been any more  different 47 years apart it took them
UVob8FMT6Rk,12528160,12534880,a really long time so by the time they  got to me i was five months pregnant i
UVob8FMT6Rk,12534880,12540800,called  my best friend and  after i hung up the phone with her i
UVob8FMT6Rk,12540800,12547439,called planned parenthood and  immediately made an appointment for an  abortion how fast was that whole process
UVob8FMT6Rk,12547439,12553920,for you  like five minutes it was so fast  patty was dealing with substance abuse
UVob8FMT6Rk,12553920,12561200,it was her first time away from home she  could barely take care of herself she  wondered how could she raise a child she
UVob8FMT6Rk,12561200,12567200,would have had to make a lot of  sacrifices  at that point she hadn't finished school
UVob8FMT6Rk,12567200,12574160,after the abortion patty got her life on  track receiving a master's degree in  ceramics becoming an artist and going on
UVob8FMT6Rk,12574160,12579600,to have three beautiful children it took  her five months and it took me five  minutes
UVob8FMT6Rk,12579600,12587040,and both of us  knew from  the moment we found out we were pregnant  that what we needed what we wanted to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,12587040,12593680,and i was just  born in a much luckier time having  access to a safe and effective abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,12593680,12600800,process didn't make it emotionally  easier for sami we've created this  shroud of shame this like
UVob8FMT6Rk,12600800,12607760,perception that it is  unacceptable patty's openness with her  daughter about her own abortion helped
UVob8FMT6Rk,12607760,12615600,sammy feel confident about her decision  she quickly started sharing her abortion  story with others i didn't believe that
UVob8FMT6Rk,12615600,12621680,one in three one in four people has  an abortion that did that seemed like a  way too high to me because i felt like
UVob8FMT6Rk,12621680,12628720,my mom was the only person i knew  but at first sammy thought about keeping  it a secret i
UVob8FMT6Rk,12628720,12634399,just didn't feel  ready to tell you i remember i had a  thought in my mind like maybe i'll just
UVob8FMT6Rk,12634399,12641120,never tell her maybe i'll never tell  anyone i never told my parents they were  already having a hard enough time with
UVob8FMT6Rk,12641120,12648640,me patty tragically passed away in 2018.  what do you think your mom would say if
UVob8FMT6Rk,12648640,12657279,she was here today and  roe was being overturned she would be so  angry she would be so frustrated and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,12657279,12664479,defeated i know for a fact that she too  would have as i did think about my  two-year-old niece and how devastating
UVob8FMT6Rk,12664479,12670000,it is that she is growing up in a world  where  rights are actively being taken away
UVob8FMT6Rk,12670000,12676800,from people  and erin this concept that women who  fought for road to be put in place in
UVob8FMT6Rk,12676800,12683200,the first place are now gonna or had  more rights than women are now going to  have is one that rings true on capitol
UVob8FMT6Rk,12683200,12689359,hill speaker pelosi earlier today said  as a woman as a mother as a grandmother  to see young girls now have fewer rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,12689359,12696000,than their moms or even their  grandmothers is something very sad for  our country  julie sirkin for us on the hill today
UVob8FMT6Rk,12696000,12701760,julie thank you  now the overturning of roe v wade means  that many women will now be forced to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12701760,12707760,travel for access to an abortion it's a  journey that's not new because of  restrictions that several states already
UVob8FMT6Rk,12707760,12714000,had in place  msnbc anchor yasmin vasugin flew with a  group of women from texas to new mexico
UVob8FMT6Rk,12714000,12719600,here's a look at their journey across  state lines  it's early in the morning and 20 young
UVob8FMT6Rk,12719600,12725439,women meet at a church in texas for one  reason they will travel to new mexico
UVob8FMT6Rk,12725439,12732080,and get an abortion i can't do this i  can't put another kid through what the  two that i already have or going through
UVob8FMT6Rk,12732080,12738640,that's just not an option right now not  for me not for him there's like no  support system right now today what
UVob8FMT6Rk,12738640,12744160,happens  is you get to make choice about your  life the new mexico religious coalition
UVob8FMT6Rk,12744160,12749840,for reproductive choice and the first  unitarian church of dallas adios
UVob8FMT6Rk,12749840,12754880,are helping these young women leave  texas  a state with one of the most restrictive
UVob8FMT6Rk,12754880,12760640,abortion laws in the nation we're  arriving  at the airport here in dallas this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,12760640,12768080,just the first leg  of a very long day for so many of these  women we're about to make it law
UVob8FMT6Rk,12768080,12775279,texas has banned the medical procedure  after six weeks and now with federal  protection for abortion rights gone
UVob8FMT6Rk,12775279,12780640,traveling across state lines will be the  reality for so many women
UVob8FMT6Rk,12780640,12787120,you want to get it done and but it's  just also like i have to go to  albuquerque to get this done advocates
UVob8FMT6Rk,12787120,12792479,of this band seeing this as a major  victory hoping to institute similar laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,12792479,12797600,with the overturn of roe  on this trip all of the women are below
UVob8FMT6Rk,12797600,12804720,the poverty line and six to 11 weeks  pregnant and without help would not be  able to make this journey only memory
UVob8FMT6Rk,12804720,12810000,and sally wanted to be filmed using  first names and sally asked not to use
UVob8FMT6Rk,12810000,12816080,her real name to protect their privacy  how do you guys feel like one leg down
UVob8FMT6Rk,12816080,12821680,you're now here  it's almost over
UVob8FMT6Rk,12821840,12828560,it's just a little bizarre that  you gotta come all the way out here dr  curtis boyd started this clinic in new
UVob8FMT6Rk,12828560,12835680,mexico and another in dallas he's one of  the oldest abortion doctors in the  country and says he's determined to make
UVob8FMT6Rk,12835680,12840438,sure these women have a way out
UVob8FMT6Rk,12841120,12846318,and you may put this swallow that with  some water
UVob8FMT6Rk,12853200,12858960,now what what i must  tell you is that's it  make it
UVob8FMT6Rk,12858960,12864720,your choice  but make it  reasonable and
UVob8FMT6Rk,12866319,12871600,wise  this is a  decision that these women are making
UVob8FMT6Rk,12871600,12877120,according to their own faith and values  it's our duty as a faith rooted  organization
UVob8FMT6Rk,12877120,12882800,to trust  what they've heard from god  and support it half of the women on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,12882800,12888000,trip came across state lines to take a  pill the other half for a 10 minute
UVob8FMT6Rk,12888000,12895760,surgical procedure  you have women out there that have been  raped  you have women out there that just
UVob8FMT6Rk,12895760,12902880,they don't have anybody or  they did it with the wrong person or  they're just not ready you can't make
UVob8FMT6Rk,12902880,12909040,women be ready for  taking care of kids because that's like  a huge step
UVob8FMT6Rk,12909040,12914479,the church where these women began their  journey  fought for abortion rights before roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,12914479,12920479,helped roe v wade to the supreme court  and is now  fighting the texas law we are going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,12920479,12925520,see a public health crisis in this  country but a lot of people don't even  want to think about it because they
UVob8FMT6Rk,12925520,12932239,don't think it affects them  but what affects one affects the other  and this is where our faith also comes
UVob8FMT6Rk,12932239,12940080,back into play  what i see is human life in front of me  and that's that's what's important
UVob8FMT6Rk,12940399,12945680,i'm aaron gilchrist at nbc news  headquarters here in new york just after  2 p.m eastern now and we continue this
UVob8FMT6Rk,12945680,12950720,hour with that breaking news impacting  millions of women across this country
UVob8FMT6Rk,12950720,12956880,the united states supreme court has  overturned roe v wade ending the  constitutional right to an abortion and
UVob8FMT6Rk,12956880,12963120,upending half a century of legal  precedent the justice's ruling was five  to four on that issue the conservative
UVob8FMT6Rk,12963120,12969920,wing justice thomas gorsuch kavanaugh  and barrett deciding to uphold the  mississippi law at the center of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,12969920,12975040,case chief justice john roberts wrote in  his own separate concurrent opinion but
UVob8FMT6Rk,12975040,12980239,stated the court should not have  overturned roe justice breyer sotomayor
UVob8FMT6Rk,12980239,12985680,and kagan dissented now this is what it  looks like outside the u.s supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,12985680,12992399,right now  a large crowd of demonstrators there  reacting to the court's decision now  being made official you might recall
UVob8FMT6Rk,12992399,12998880,that draft of the opinion written by  justice samuel alito it was leaked a  little more than a month ago now today
UVob8FMT6Rk,12998880,13006399,on the steps of the nation's highest  court there is outrage from some and  jubilation from others
UVob8FMT6Rk,13006399,13014399,it feels like a betrayal it feels like  my country doesn't love me  and appreciate my body as a woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,13014399,13021680,complete and utter joy that it was  finally overturned that the battle is  not over the abortion industrial complex
UVob8FMT6Rk,13021680,13026880,is strong in blue states and we got to  go after them as well for me personally
UVob8FMT6Rk,13026880,13033760,i'm adopted  [Music]  so knowing other mothers out there
UVob8FMT6Rk,13033760,13036760,okay
UVob8FMT6Rk,13039120,13047040,it's pretty hard to see like i was lucky  and i have a wonderful mother
UVob8FMT6Rk,13048479,13053840,this is  now this decision is setting off a
UVob8FMT6Rk,13053840,13059359,cascade of repercussions half of the 50  states are certain or likely to ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,13059359,13064960,abortion within their borders i want to  bring in nbc's ken dylanian now in  washington has been covering this issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,13064960,13072080,for us so ken uh this decision obviously  was not one that was unexpected after  that uh draft opinion was leaked last
UVob8FMT6Rk,13072080,13078640,month walk us through the final decision  from the court here  yeah as far as we can tell the um the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13078640,13084560,decision by justice samuel alito tracks  pretty closely with the one that was  leaked uh makes the same reasoning which
UVob8FMT6Rk,13084560,13090399,is it's kind of an argument that's been  made by conservatives for as long as the  roe v wade decision was on the books 49
UVob8FMT6Rk,13090399,13096720,years which is that it was wrongly  decided because it it it found a right  to an abortion in the constitution and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13096720,13103040,the 14th amendment that the  conservatives believe does not exist and  so that's what the majority here held
UVob8FMT6Rk,13103040,13109199,that that there is no right to abortion  in the constitution that it goes back to  the states and as you mentioned many
UVob8FMT6Rk,13109199,13114479,many states  are poised or have already  outlawed abortion right from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13114479,13120560,beginning now justice roberts tried to  strike a middle ground  and and and if it was up to him he would
UVob8FMT6Rk,13120560,13126000,not have overturned roe v wade although  he would have allowed greater  restrictions um at the on the point at
UVob8FMT6Rk,13126000,13131520,which you can start states can start  banning abortions but roberts didn't  hold sway the conservatives had the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13131520,13138319,votes um and they won the day and so a  right that had been enshrined in the  constitution for 49 years is no longer
UVob8FMT6Rk,13138319,13143920,there aaron i want to ask you about  justin's clarence thomas in particular  if i can ken he wants the court to look
UVob8FMT6Rk,13143920,13150640,at other decisions and a lot of people  have have heard that to mean look at  same-sex marriage look at contraception
UVob8FMT6Rk,13150640,13158000,what did justice thomas have to say  yeah he was actually pretty explicit  about it aaron you know alito in his in
UVob8FMT6Rk,13158000,13163359,his decision said look this is only  about abortion this should not be  construed to affect our reasoning here
UVob8FMT6Rk,13163359,13170560,should not be considered to affect these  other decisions about um  that go to sort of rights and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13170560,13177680,thomas said the opposite he said that  these decisions about same-sex marriage  and and um and other kinds of uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,13177680,13183680,personal issues were wrongly decided and  the court should take another look at  them um which is alarming a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13183680,13190560,people across the country right now the  notion that uh this isn't the end of  where the supreme court could start  repealing rights but as far as we can
UVob8FMT6Rk,13190560,13196960,tell it's only a view that thomas  holds or at least is expressing right  now we also know that attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,13196960,13202479,mayor garland released a statement about  this ruling today as well what is he  saying about the justice department's
UVob8FMT6Rk,13202479,13208160,role in uh protecting uh abortion going  forward as the president indicated an  hour or so ago
UVob8FMT6Rk,13208160,13214800,yeah i mean well look garland is saying  the justice department profoundly  disagrees with the the ruling and um and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13214800,13220000,and it's a setback for reproductive  rights and he's also saying that the  justice department will do what it can
UVob8FMT6Rk,13220000,13225359,to um to  keep fighting for women's reproductive  rights but there's only so much the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13225359,13230960,justice department can do in the face of  this very stark decision um and so we'll  have to see how that plays out going
UVob8FMT6Rk,13230960,13238160,forward erin all right ken delaney in  for us in our washington bureau today  ken thank you we appreciate it i want to  go to nbc's mar barrett now she has been
UVob8FMT6Rk,13238160,13243520,outside the u.s supreme court as the  crowds have been growing there  throughout the day maura i know you've
UVob8FMT6Rk,13243520,13251920,been talking to demonstrators there all  day long what are some of the opponents  of abortion rights telling you today
UVob8FMT6Rk,13252479,13259199,well it was an immediate celebration for  that group of demonstrators aaron as the  decision came down people jumping up and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13259199,13266000,down elated and celebrating uh the  decision that put forward what they say  that they had been working towards they
UVob8FMT6Rk,13266000,13271600,said one woman i spoke to said it was  sheer determination and that she was  feeling utter joy and relief seeing this
UVob8FMT6Rk,13271600,13278399,decision come down i spoke with another  younger woman  who explained this is something that  she's been waiting for her entire life i
UVob8FMT6Rk,13278399,13284560,would hear some of that conversation  it's about the woman and the child  making sure that she has all the support
UVob8FMT6Rk,13284560,13291199,that she needs women need support and  resources they do not need abortion  every child deserves life
UVob8FMT6Rk,13291199,13297680,human rights happen human rights start  at conception and end at natural death  and that is what i'm going to fight for
UVob8FMT6Rk,13297680,13303600,until the day that i die  [Music]  and so we had a lot of very emotional
UVob8FMT6Rk,13303600,13310160,conversations on both sides but we saw a  lot of tears of relief and joy and  smiles coming from this group and then
UVob8FMT6Rk,13310160,13316479,what's interesting though is you look  behind me there clearly is a very large  crowd my photographer is going to walk  around here for a minute so you can take
UVob8FMT6Rk,13316479,13323040,a look but you'll notice that the signs  that remain in the the hours since the  decision came down are all uh from
UVob8FMT6Rk,13323040,13328479,demonstrators who support abortion  rights we saw a very large group of  people that opposed abortion rights that
UVob8FMT6Rk,13328479,13334880,we're here celebrating for a very long  time cheering praying singing  and then about two hours ago they
UVob8FMT6Rk,13334880,13341680,decided to march around the supreme  court uh and largely the group that  remains is the ones that are have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,13341680,13346720,dejected and disappointed by this  decision erin  so let's talk about the other side of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13346720,13353119,this as you referenced there maura what  are you hearing from abortion rights  supporters
UVob8FMT6Rk,13353840,13360239,well it's interesting because this group  as i look around me and it still stands  this way is a group of largely younger
UVob8FMT6Rk,13360239,13366399,people for the most part and that's kind  of what we saw here throughout the day  and it's younger women who think that
UVob8FMT6Rk,13366399,13372720,people younger people in general that  have seen  rights taken away that they as they put  it uh in the country they're concerned
UVob8FMT6Rk,13372720,13378880,about the divisiveness of the country  they tell me but i want you to hear from  hannah she's a 66 year old woman who i
UVob8FMT6Rk,13378880,13385760,met here and she was kind of standing  further away from the crowd of concerns  for covid but she noted that this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,13385760,13390960,something she's seen  a write scene that she granted granted  in her lifetime and now taken away and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,13390960,13396080,want you to hear about what she  experienced before a row was passed  almost 50 years ago here's some of our
UVob8FMT6Rk,13396080,13401600,conversation  i was in high school in 1973
UVob8FMT6Rk,13401600,13407760,and i can say that  the stories were out there what happened
UVob8FMT6Rk,13407760,13415600,to women if they needed an abortion we  lost a  high school classmate to
UVob8FMT6Rk,13415600,13421520,she was taken we were told out of  country to get an abortion and then we  never saw her again because she was
UVob8FMT6Rk,13421520,13428479,moved to a family outside of our town  and outside of the state because of the  embarrassment that was scary to know
UVob8FMT6Rk,13428479,13435120,that that could happen to someone  [Music]  to see us going back to knitting needles
UVob8FMT6Rk,13435120,13442279,and the whole thing  i just i'm stunned i don't i don't  understand
UVob8FMT6Rk,13442560,13449199,and aaron you see the imagery of  knitting needles and clothes hangers  very graphic images that people are
UVob8FMT6Rk,13449199,13455600,thinking about now and that's something  that time and time again talking to  people this morning it wasn't the  concern necessarily
UVob8FMT6Rk,13455600,13462160,it was concerned about their rights  being taken away but it was it was the  acknowledgment that abortions are still  going to happen it's a matter of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13462160,13468640,fact that there will not be safe  abortions that women will be could die  from seeking an abortion and that is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13468640,13475680,main concern that we've seen from from  this group here today as to why they're  so upset that this decision was
UVob8FMT6Rk,13475680,13481680,overturned really painting a picture of  what it means to go backwards on this on  this particular issue maura i do want to
UVob8FMT6Rk,13481680,13486960,ask you uh about the crowd behind you i  know d.c police have said that they are  going to increase their presence really
UVob8FMT6Rk,13486960,13492800,across the city throughout the day today  it seems as though the demonstrations  behind you have been fairly peaceful
UVob8FMT6Rk,13492800,13499840,talk to us about uh what you've seen  among the people there as you've been  there over several hours now
UVob8FMT6Rk,13500000,13505279,we saw a lot of verbal tension verbal  arguments between both sides of the  protesters but i do want you to take a
UVob8FMT6Rk,13505279,13510640,look at the fence that surrounds the  supreme court here and you see the  police lining the front as well the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13510640,13515920,fence was put into place uh when the  draft opinion was released we saw those  massive protests in dc and around the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13515920,13522720,country  after that and we did see an increased  police presence this morning  police showing up with motorcycles and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13522720,13529040,bikes to kind of divide the two groups  of protesters but interestingly they  peeled off actually right before the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13529040,13535439,decision was was ruled and we have seen  the police take different shifts we  heard that a bridge coming into the city
UVob8FMT6Rk,13535439,13542160,had been shut down to  deter certain protesters but like you  said it's been largely peaceful uh very
UVob8FMT6Rk,13542160,13548479,collaborative considering this is one  main group that's left but it's  definitely something that dc police are  keeping an eye on erin all right maura
UVob8FMT6Rk,13548479,13554319,barrett for us on the ground outside the  supreme court today maura thank you  nbc news correspondent josh letterman is
UVob8FMT6Rk,13554319,13560960,joining us now from the white house josh  as we just noted with maura police in  d.c are on high alert now after this
UVob8FMT6Rk,13560960,13567520,decision from the supreme court there's  a full departmental activation as the  term that we understand is in place
UVob8FMT6Rk,13567520,13574239,until uh tuesday of next week what are  authorities they're singing saying about  the need for more security
UVob8FMT6Rk,13574239,13579760,well they're saying that law enforcement  agencies really across this whole region  erin are going to be on a heightened
UVob8FMT6Rk,13579760,13586160,state of alert not only because of the  protests that we're seeing that maura  barrett is at uh and others that could
UVob8FMT6Rk,13586160,13591760,be cropping up elsewhere but also  frankly because this is the home of the  supreme court which means that it's the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13591760,13598239,home of the supreme court justices who  also reside in the area who already had  their security stepped up in
UVob8FMT6Rk,13598239,13604880,anticipation of this decision so here in  the district of columbia we know that  the metropolitan police department who
UVob8FMT6Rk,13604880,13610399,played a large role responding to the  january 6th attacks they are  coordinating with the district's
UVob8FMT6Rk,13610399,13617279,homeland security and emergency  management agency we are told to expect  a heightened visibility of police
UVob8FMT6Rk,13617279,13624080,presence on the streets more policemen  that we will be able to see in the  coming days and weeks in this region and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13624080,13631760,then just over the border into maryland  into montgomery county which is a suburb  of washington d.c where three justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,13631760,13636800,live justices roberts gorsuch and  kavanaugh all live there the montgomery
UVob8FMT6Rk,13636800,13642319,county authorities have said that they  are very aware of the situation that  they are directing resources
UVob8FMT6Rk,13642319,13647600,appropriately and that district  commanders within their police  department uh know exactly where the
UVob8FMT6Rk,13647600,13654239,sensitive sites are such as the homes of  the supreme court justices now none of  this is to say that people are expecting
UVob8FMT6Rk,13654239,13660560,violence and certainly we heard from  president biden today saying peaceful  peaceful peaceful urging people to
UVob8FMT6Rk,13660560,13666560,demonstrate peacefully and in fact the  d.c police they are saying that they  support people's first amendment rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,13666560,13672720,nobody is discouraging of people from  going out and speaking their mind about  this issue people just want it to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,13672720,13678640,peaceful and that is why law enforcement  is making sure they are ready for  anything that could happen erin
UVob8FMT6Rk,13678640,13684479,all right josh letterman for us at the  white house today keeping an eye on  security efforts around d.c josh thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,13684479,13689920,you nbc news correspondent kathy park is  joining us live now from jackson  mississippi
UVob8FMT6Rk,13689920,13696239,kathy the abortion clinic at the center  of this particular decision is expected  to hold a news conference this afternoon
UVob8FMT6Rk,13696239,13701358,about four o'clock eastern time what do  we expect to hear from them today
UVob8FMT6Rk,13702720,13708080,erin that is a very good question we  actually heard from the director shortly
UVob8FMT6Rk,13708080,13714160,after the leak back in may and she is  obviously disappointed she was actually  disappointed ever since the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,13714160,13721199,court took this case so that is probably  the same rhetoric that will be repeated  later on this afternoon but it is likely
UVob8FMT6Rk,13721199,13727520,that she will offer some guidance  to women who are still trying to seek  abortions beyond the state of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13727520,13732960,mississippi safely and legally and since  they knew that this was likely to come
UVob8FMT6Rk,13732960,13740399,any day now they were  mobilizing folks here in this community  gathering resources and also funds to
UVob8FMT6Rk,13740399,13745680,help those who may not be able to afford  traveling to different states
UVob8FMT6Rk,13745680,13752479,illinois being the closest one they said  but the clinic will have this 10-day  period essentially because this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,13752479,13758160,trigger loss state so this is a protocol  here in the state of mississippi where  the attorney general will be weighing in
UVob8FMT6Rk,13758160,13763600,and making it official and we we heard  from lynn fitz the attorney general put  out a statement via twitter and she
UVob8FMT6Rk,13763600,13769840,called to say a victory so based on her  statement it's likely that this will be  official in a matter of days so once
UVob8FMT6Rk,13769840,13775680,that's the case this last remaining  abortion clinic in mississippi  will be relocating it sounds like
UVob8FMT6Rk,13775680,13783520,they'll be going to new mexico so a lot  of things were happening behind the  scenes they were mobilizing behind the  scenes to make abortions accessible even
UVob8FMT6Rk,13783520,13790080,beyond the state of mississippi aaron  kathy i know mississippi is one of these  states with that abortion trigger law
UVob8FMT6Rk,13790080,13797521,can you help us understand the process  of how that's going to go into effect  now that we have this ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,13797920,13805600,yeah so just like it sounds here in the  state of mississippi and in 12 other  states in the south it will be a matter
UVob8FMT6Rk,13805600,13810960,of days almost immediately for an  abortion ban only exceptions for
UVob8FMT6Rk,13810960,13816479,if the pregnancy could impact the  mother's health or in a case of rape so
UVob8FMT6Rk,13816479,13822800,once again they have this 10-day window  where the attorney general will make  this official and then the last abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,13822800,13828319,clinic here in the state will have to  close  so that's kind of what we're looking at
UVob8FMT6Rk,13828319,13834560,at this point erin but some folks here  have told us that they have been  preparing for this day there have been a
UVob8FMT6Rk,13834560,13839840,lot of restrictions already here in the  state of mississippi but now they'll be  looking ahead to see what other options
UVob8FMT6Rk,13839840,13845600,are out there beyond the state of  mississippi that was going to be my next  question to you actually what options
UVob8FMT6Rk,13845600,13850800,will women have in mississippi who want  to be able to have an abortion at this
UVob8FMT6Rk,13850800,13857040,point do they  do we have an understanding of where  they are likely to go
UVob8FMT6Rk,13857120,13862880,yeah so that is the big concern right  because  if they do want to do it legally and
UVob8FMT6Rk,13862880,13868080,safely they will have to travel  anywhere between seven hours to 22 hours
UVob8FMT6Rk,13868080,13873439,in some places  once again that that clinic  might be opening up in new mexico so
UVob8FMT6Rk,13873439,13879120,that is an option there but that costs  money  for airfare whether you have to take off
UVob8FMT6Rk,13879120,13885120,work i mean there are all these things  that people have to consider and  pro-choice advocates are saying look
UVob8FMT6Rk,13885120,13891680,this will disproportionately impact  women of color they don't necessarily  have the resources the money
UVob8FMT6Rk,13891680,13898000,and the time off from work to do this so  so that is a concern and we heard from a  doctor who works at this abortion clinic
UVob8FMT6Rk,13898000,13904160,in mississippi and her biggest concern  is uh just the the rate of miscarriages  possibly going up erin all right kathy
UVob8FMT6Rk,13904160,13909199,park for us in mississippi today kathy  thank you  with me uh in studio now our nbc news
UVob8FMT6Rk,13909199,13914560,legal analyst danny cevallos and nbc  news reporter chloe atkins as well and  you've been helping us to sort of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13914560,13919760,understand uh both the the ruling and  some of  what's been happening in the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,13919760,13926479,leading up to this so danny i'll start  with you just your reading of the the  justice's decision today and and sort of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13926479,13931840,the legal argument that they're making  in it basically it's that row and casey  were wrong but just because they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,13931840,13938000,wrong that doesn't end the inquiry if  they're wrong it's now what do we do  with it now that it's wrong do we allow
UVob8FMT6Rk,13938000,13945359,it to exist because it's been around a  long time well they apply their test for  starry decisis and they ask alito asks
UVob8FMT6Rk,13945359,13952239,well is this a workable rule that we  have in rowan casey and they conclude  it's not it's led to all kinds of
UVob8FMT6Rk,13952239,13959680,division and the applicability of a test  that nobody really knows how to apply  the undo burden test what is an undue
UVob8FMT6Rk,13959680,13965840,burden i mean arguably if you were to  pull the supreme court justices today  even the liberal justices might disagree
UVob8FMT6Rk,13965840,13972960,on what exactly is an undue burden so  that workability is a significant factor  in deciding whether or not to keep a
UVob8FMT6Rk,13972960,13980000,case even if it is wrongly decided it  has to be not only wrong but uh  egregiously wrong as justice kavanaugh
UVob8FMT6Rk,13980000,13986080,might put it and unworkable and so  that's why alito delves into the history
UVob8FMT6Rk,13986080,13991120,of what are called substantive due  process rights like i said earlier you  have two kinds of rights those that we
UVob8FMT6Rk,13991120,13996640,know that are explicit in the  constitution but those that the court  has recognized over the years that are
UVob8FMT6Rk,13996640,14001840,not in the constitution but implicit in  the concept of ordered liberty they are
UVob8FMT6Rk,14001840,14007520,deeply rooted in our history and  traditions the challenge is nobody  really knows anymore exactly what they
UVob8FMT6Rk,14007520,14012800,are and after this decision this may be  arguably the beginning of the end of
UVob8FMT6Rk,14012800,14019120,substantive due process in other words  unless it is specifically enumerated in  the constitution it's not in there at
UVob8FMT6Rk,14019120,14026000,least according uh to alito and  certainly it seems according to justice  thomas who again i just keep coming back
UVob8FMT6Rk,14026000,14033040,to the most blockbuster line in the  opinion i should say concurring opinion  is the idea that you should revisit uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,14033040,14040560,that we all should revisit these other  opinions these decisions that were based  on that kind of penumbra the glowing of
UVob8FMT6Rk,14040560,14048000,rights within the constitution that  don't appear explicitly in there but uh  to challenge those now would really be
UVob8FMT6Rk,14048000,14054000,surprising especially because alito went  to such efforts to say  hold on you have nothing to worry about
UVob8FMT6Rk,14054000,14060960,all these other rights we're not going  after them it's only abortion abortions  unique and here are the reasons why you
UVob8FMT6Rk,14060960,14067359,know a lot of folks wonder why does  alito go into all of this history  especially why do they go into a history
UVob8FMT6Rk,14067359,14073760,involving people from a time  who argue that arguably had very  retrograde opinions about how the world
UVob8FMT6Rk,14073760,14080160,should be you know why do we trust them  well that's part of the deeply rooted in  history and traditions analysis and if
UVob8FMT6Rk,14080160,14087040,that analysis had yielded the answer  that oh abortion has always been 100  percent approved of uh it's never been
UVob8FMT6Rk,14087040,14092640,illegal it's never been outlawed then  alito might have concluded differently  but that's why he goes into such lengths
UVob8FMT6Rk,14092640,14097760,to discuss america's history with  abortion  chloe i want to ask you you've been
UVob8FMT6Rk,14097760,14104479,covering abortion issues for a long time  now help us to understand  the impact that this decision is going
UVob8FMT6Rk,14104479,14109520,to have and who is going to be primarily  largely impacted by this decision that
UVob8FMT6Rk,14109520,14116640,that overturns roe v wade low income and  poor women are going to be impacted the  most women with means will always be
UVob8FMT6Rk,14116640,14123120,able to fly to a liberal-leaning coastal  state to get care i spoke to an abortion  provider who's based out of new york who
UVob8FMT6Rk,14123120,14128160,has treated a handful of texas patients  since they enacted sba which bans
UVob8FMT6Rk,14128160,14134720,abortion at six weeks and she said that  the women who were traveling from texas  to new york to get that care are largely
UVob8FMT6Rk,14134720,14141359,white are largely  they have means or a connection to the  state of new york and she is most
UVob8FMT6Rk,14141359,14148239,worried i touched base with her again  this morning she is most worried about  these low-income poor and women of color
UVob8FMT6Rk,14148239,14154640,because those women will be denied care  and when women  who are living around the poverty line
UVob8FMT6Rk,14154640,14161920,and they're denied care they're pushed  even  further into poverty so they're going to  face higher tax liens
UVob8FMT6Rk,14161920,14167439,larger amounts of debts higher evictions  and are also more likely to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14167439,14173920,you know experience negative health  outcomes so we're talking about anxiety  depression chronic pain and they're also
UVob8FMT6Rk,14173920,14179359,more likely to stay in touch with a  violent domestic partner so
UVob8FMT6Rk,14179359,14185600,you know this impact we're talking about  has a huge impact on their livelihoods
UVob8FMT6Rk,14185600,14192399,danny you know i can't help what to  think it's chloe just sort of ticks  through that list of of other issues you  can't help but wonder how it is that the
UVob8FMT6Rk,14192399,14198640,court doesn't necessarily look at those  things too we looked at some numbers  there were more than 900 000 abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,14198640,14204640,in this country according to the  guttmacher institute  why doesn't the supreme court recognize
UVob8FMT6Rk,14204640,14210399,the the reality of how roe  impacted the people who live in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,14210399,14215760,country today yeah the guttmacher  institute does appear actually in the  overall opinion but
UVob8FMT6Rk,14215760,14221600,so the question is why not consider the  fact that many women are having  abortions uh in the united states and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,14221600,14229040,think maybe the answer to that if you  were asking one of the conservative  justices would be that just because  people do it doesn't necessarily make it
UVob8FMT6Rk,14229040,14235439,a constitutional right there are many  things that are permitted but that are  not constitutional rights and can be
UVob8FMT6Rk,14235439,14240640,taken away and the fact that nine  hundred thousand women by the way i mean  i think that's a compelling argument
UVob8FMT6Rk,14240640,14247600,that it is uh even if it's not deeply  rooted in the great past history and  traditions but it may be deeply rooted
UVob8FMT6Rk,14247600,14253439,today but then again the conservative  side of the court might say yes you have  a lot of people getting abortions that
UVob8FMT6Rk,14253439,14258960,doesn't make it a constitutional right  and yet  just as you did back in uh at the time
UVob8FMT6Rk,14258960,14264000,of the 14th amendment in uh  many a century ago
UVob8FMT6Rk,14264000,14271120,people were of different minds about  abortion most states or a majority of  states outlawed it or at least somewhat
UVob8FMT6Rk,14271120,14276880,criminalized it and even today many  states are trying to criminalize it so  when you're looking as the court does
UVob8FMT6Rk,14276880,14282399,when they're applying that washington b  glucksberg test that deeply rooted in  history and traditions you need
UVob8FMT6Rk,14282399,14287600,something that's pretty much consistent  throughout time so i would suspect that  alita would look at those numbers the
UVob8FMT6Rk,14287600,14294560,conservative justices would say sure a  lot of people are doing it it's allowed  that doesn't make it a fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,14294560,14301279,constitutional right that we as a court  will step in and override the will of  the people in the several states that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,14301279,14307520,just my guess at how they would respond  all right i'm going to ask danny and  chloe to stick with us here as we  continue our coverage today i want to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14307520,14314239,bring in nbc news now correspondent isa  gutierrez issa abortion restrictions we  know vary from state to state at this
UVob8FMT6Rk,14314239,14319600,point colorado is one of just a few  states  that does not restrict late term
UVob8FMT6Rk,14319600,14325840,abortions how have clinics there  been getting ready have they been  preparing for today's decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,14325840,14331199,yeah erin they have been frantically  trying to expand trying to hire uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,14331199,14338560,trying to get as much staff as they can  to bring in more patients because they  say that even in the last year their
UVob8FMT6Rk,14338560,14343680,patient load has doubled even tripled in  some cases again because these services
UVob8FMT6Rk,14343680,14348960,are only allowed to be performed in just  a few states so i went to a clinic in
UVob8FMT6Rk,14348960,14354560,colorado that explained to me another  thing that they've been doing also is  ramping up their security systems they
UVob8FMT6Rk,14354560,14360319,have bulletproof windows now  they have security cameras everywhere  because they are very concerned even
UVob8FMT6Rk,14360319,14365600,more today moving forward about the  safety of their staff and more  importantly of their patients they have
UVob8FMT6Rk,14365600,14370880,protesters lining up outside as the  patients walk in  every day that they have procedures
UVob8FMT6Rk,14370880,14377520,going on and they're concerned they say  that they know  as fact that this decision is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14377520,14385439,increase the number of women looking for  late term abortions why because they're  going to have to wait uh to be able to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14385439,14391920,gather like you've been hearing the  means to be able to go out of state and  access this historically late term
UVob8FMT6Rk,14391920,14398160,abortions make up a very small  percentage of the total abortions in the  country in 2019 the cdc said that there
UVob8FMT6Rk,14398160,14403279,were only about a few thousand nearly 5  000  but we've already seen the need the
UVob8FMT6Rk,14403279,14408720,demand go up these clinics say and  they're expecting many more patients to  be coming knocking on their doors
UVob8FMT6Rk,14408720,14414160,because they need these services  i understand that you also spoke to a  doctor there who performs late term
UVob8FMT6Rk,14414160,14419600,abortions what did he tell you about  about the impact of of roe being  overturned
UVob8FMT6Rk,14419600,14425439,he and and others uh very simply said to  me that this decision is going to cause
UVob8FMT6Rk,14425439,14432239,women to die many times these late-term  abortions are performed on women who  have learned uh you know in in their
UVob8FMT6Rk,14432239,14438239,third trimesters uh that this pregnancy  is going to be terminal either to them
UVob8FMT6Rk,14438239,14444960,or to the child that they are carrying  these are high risk  abortions and again he says that this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,14444960,14451840,going to impact those women who cannot  go out of state who cannot  go to a clinic like his
UVob8FMT6Rk,14451840,14458399,to get these  these abortions safely and that they  will turn to unsafe measures in some
UVob8FMT6Rk,14458399,14465600,cases and that their lives will be at  risk take a listen  now we have a situation where a woman's
UVob8FMT6Rk,14465600,14474000,life and health is at the mercy of the  next election  and also the mercy at the mercy of her  zip code this is this is preposterous
UVob8FMT6Rk,14474000,14479120,these uh procedures later in pregnancy  that he believes are going to be in
UVob8FMT6Rk,14479120,14485680,higher demand and already have been in  the last year with bands in states like  texas and oklahoma they're very costly
UVob8FMT6Rk,14485680,14491520,on top of being high risk right we're  talking about procedures that cost over  a thousand dollars well over a thousand
UVob8FMT6Rk,14491520,14497600,dollars not to mention the costs of  airfare and whatnot to get to these  places but he's concerned right now that
UVob8FMT6Rk,14497600,14502640,they're not going to be able uh to treat  all of the patients who are coming to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14502640,14509040,him erin you say you've made the point  here we're talking about real people  real women's real lives here what about
UVob8FMT6Rk,14509040,14514160,some of the patients there in colorado  what are you hearing from them about  this ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,14514160,14521359,erin they're  terrified they're sad  but most of all erin they are angry i
UVob8FMT6Rk,14521359,14528880,spoke with um one of his former patients  erica christensen uh who went out of  state herself uh to get an abortion uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,14528880,14534080,with dr hearn in colorado she found out  uh in her third trimester that there
UVob8FMT6Rk,14534080,14539680,were medical complications that could  put her life at risk  take a listen
UVob8FMT6Rk,14539680,14544960,i remain angry and it is sort of what  gets me up in the morning when things
UVob8FMT6Rk,14544960,14550640,are feeling so terrible i'm much more  angry than i am sad because again
UVob8FMT6Rk,14550640,14555760,sadness i could work through it made  sense to me grief is a an emotion that i
UVob8FMT6Rk,14555760,14563120,could work through because it's  something that i knew  rage at politicians creating unjust laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,14563120,14568720,that made that punished me in my deepest  moments of pain and grief
UVob8FMT6Rk,14568720,14574319,that is something i still cannot wrap my  brain around  erica said to me that she feels
UVob8FMT6Rk,14574319,14580800,extremely lucky that she's aware of the  privilege that she had to be able to get  to colorado to have this procedure done
UVob8FMT6Rk,14580800,14586880,and she says she knows that there are  many who do not have that opportunity  and erin we have our full story coming
UVob8FMT6Rk,14586880,14592319,up on hallie jackson now at 5 pm all  right we'll be looking forward to that  tier on nbc news now issa gutierrez
UVob8FMT6Rk,14592319,14598640,thank you  i want to bring in dr cheryl hamlin now  an ob gyn from massachusetts dr hamlin
UVob8FMT6Rk,14598640,14604160,we appreciate you joining us  i understand that you've been traveling  from massachusetts to jackson
UVob8FMT6Rk,14604160,14610080,mississippi once a month to perform  abortions at the the only abortion  clinic in that state
UVob8FMT6Rk,14610080,14616239,can you talk to us a little bit about  about your work and and how this came to  to be and what you do when you're in
UVob8FMT6Rk,14616239,14622080,mississippi  uh yeah so you know it started out um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14622080,14628319,really after the trump election that i  realized that um  you know this right we can't take for
UVob8FMT6Rk,14628319,14634160,granted so um i really wanted to do more  than just practice in massachusetts um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14634160,14641680,and so with the mutual connection i  started going to  mississippi in 2017
UVob8FMT6Rk,14641680,14648399,and it's you know and i initially  thought it was just no more than to  improve access in mississippi that you
UVob8FMT6Rk,14648399,14653840,know will work to kind of change laws so  that local doctors might feel more  comfortable working there and then i can
UVob8FMT6Rk,14653840,14660080,go go back home to massachusetts i never  imagined that you know five years later
UVob8FMT6Rk,14660080,14666560,this would be happening  given that fact what are your concerns  now what do you what are your concerns
UVob8FMT6Rk,14666560,14673359,about the void that will be left in in  several states we know when clinics are  forced to close
UVob8FMT6Rk,14673359,14680080,i mean much of what people have said  before me i mean that it is going to  affect and and this hap you know we have
UVob8FMT6Rk,14680080,14685600,you know the template for this this all  happened  pre-roll where women who could afford to
UVob8FMT6Rk,14685600,14692399,um you know flew to new york they even  flew to england when you know england  liberalized your laws before we did and
UVob8FMT6Rk,14692399,14698319,so that's going to happen again that  women who can afford to buy a plane  ticket or take a week off of work
UVob8FMT6Rk,14698319,14704239,they'll do that and they'll come to  massachusetts and and  you know i have seen people from texas
UVob8FMT6Rk,14704239,14710880,you know here in massachusetts um but  there's this whole lot of people that  that you know for any of those reasons
UVob8FMT6Rk,14710880,14717199,that the cost of the transportation  the cost of the procedure and again  taking more time off work is a huge
UVob8FMT6Rk,14717199,14723439,factor because  you know they're working paycheck to  paycheck and  you know and especially as the stigma
UVob8FMT6Rk,14723439,14728960,goes up they can't always tell their  employer why they why they're taking  time off um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14728960,14734160,and i just think a lot of those women  are not going to make it out of the  state
UVob8FMT6Rk,14734160,14741120,um which would lead to you know one um  you know self-induced abortions that
UVob8FMT6Rk,14741120,14747359,you know can be safe and in the proper  setting but  but obviously we're creating an
UVob8FMT6Rk,14747359,14752560,environment where they're going to be  less safe less safe as well as um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14752560,14758319,you know women can as we've said before  as women will be continuing pregnancies  that probably aren't safe for them to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,14758319,14764000,continuing  um and um you know they're going to be  you know so there's going to be women
UVob8FMT6Rk,14764000,14769040,who die from really high-risk  pregnancies because  um they really shouldn't have continued
UVob8FMT6Rk,14769040,14774399,the pregnancy to begin with and you know  you can't say oh well you know it was  life-threatening at eight weeks but it
UVob8FMT6Rk,14774399,14779680,will be later on  uh you know i think you sort of touched  on it a bit here i want to ask you about
UVob8FMT6Rk,14779680,14785600,uh mental health this is a conversation  that we've been having more and more  often in this country can you talk a  little bit about
UVob8FMT6Rk,14785600,14790720,what kind of toll uh a lack of abortion  access could have on on mental health
UVob8FMT6Rk,14790720,14796319,for women in this country  yeah i mean there's the obvious um you  know
UVob8FMT6Rk,14796319,14802880,postpartum blues postpartum psychosis it  happens but there's also um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14802880,14808479,you know i mean a lot of the women i see  just want to  provide for the children that they do
UVob8FMT6Rk,14808479,14813520,have and they recognize that  you know having another
UVob8FMT6Rk,14813520,14818800,pregnancy is going to just increase  their poverty is going to increase the  time that they have to spend with their
UVob8FMT6Rk,14818800,14825199,other kids maybe they have to stop  working and rely on  one income and you know these are people
UVob8FMT6Rk,14825199,14830239,that are just trying to keep their head  up of water to begin with and so now you  throw in another
UVob8FMT6Rk,14830239,14836560,another child and you know god forbid  another potentially sick child or you  know a child that has um
UVob8FMT6Rk,14836560,14842399,you know increased needs  and  they're just not going to be able to do  it and it's and it's gonna just lead
UVob8FMT6Rk,14842399,14848000,them further into  poverty  dr cheryl hamlin we appreciate your time
UVob8FMT6Rk,14848000,14853600,today and your perspective on this  thanks for joining us  thank you so much  now we have crossed over the bottom of
UVob8FMT6Rk,14853600,14859760,the hour now i do want to reset a bit if  we can julia ainsley is joining us from  outside the supreme court uh where she's
UVob8FMT6Rk,14859760,14865359,been watching activities there and  following this decision in particular uh  through some of the details of it julia
UVob8FMT6Rk,14865359,14871439,the ruling was more than 200 pages long  can you walk us through some of the key  points as you've been able to assess
UVob8FMT6Rk,14871439,14877680,them  yeah we've been speaking to a lot of  people out here a lot of them really
UVob8FMT6Rk,14877680,14883359,angry honestly this crowd has been  growing denser and angrier by the hour  now and you'll see behind me that we
UVob8FMT6Rk,14883359,14889199,have capitol police a lot of these  people came out here when members of the  of the democratic party from the house
UVob8FMT6Rk,14889199,14896159,side came to speak they're really here  to protect the members of congress who  are on their way to speak less so the
UVob8FMT6Rk,14896159,14901520,crowd so far it has stayed peaceful  although verbally uh pretty intense and
UVob8FMT6Rk,14901520,14907120,we've seen people conflict with each  other out here from both sides and we've  spoken to the people who were very
UVob8FMT6Rk,14907120,14913840,impassioned about today's opinion let's  take a listen to what they've told me
UVob8FMT6Rk,14917199,14922960,uh  julia okay  go ahead it seems like we don't have  that sound ready
UVob8FMT6Rk,14922960,14929040,yeah yeah that's okay well  some of these people have been talking  about how they are overjoyed by today's
UVob8FMT6Rk,14929040,14935120,decision this is something that they've  been following since roe versus wade uh  was actually enacted and then again in
UVob8FMT6Rk,14935120,14941439,the 90s when it was upheld now they're  overjoyed today they say that there are  people in their families who had  abortions who've regretted that we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,14941439,14947600,also spoken to a number of people a lot  of women and men who say that a basic
UVob8FMT6Rk,14947600,14953040,right that they thought that they had  protected has now been overturned that  they feel that their country has turned
UVob8FMT6Rk,14953040,14959359,their back on them we've seen a lot of  people with just incredibly uh intense  emotions today a lot of people yelling
UVob8FMT6Rk,14959359,14964560,in each other's faces a lot of bull  horns a lot of people frankly just
UVob8FMT6Rk,14964560,14970399,you know at a point where um you could  see emotions and possibly you know a
UVob8FMT6Rk,14970399,14976960,threat over spilling here but we do have  capital police here now on standby you  can see people behind me here we've got
UVob8FMT6Rk,14976960,14982159,bull horns we've got protesters  you can see you can barely even see
UVob8FMT6Rk,14982159,14987520,through this crowd here behind me uh a  number of them have
UVob8FMT6Rk,14987520,14993680,really been facing off that would be the  best way to describe it  some people have been pulled away we see
UVob8FMT6Rk,14993680,14998720,more people come through and another  thing i have to point out just about the  security situation is that capitol
UVob8FMT6Rk,14998720,15005040,police have barricaded this in such a  way that it's really like a pinhole to  get in and out of this crowd where i am
UVob8FMT6Rk,15005040,15011760,right now there's about a single file  path to get in and out so it definitely  has you know raises some security
UVob8FMT6Rk,15011760,15018479,concerns about what capitol police and  supreme court police will be doing to  protect the crowd rather than just the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15018479,15023840,members of congress in this situation  all right julia ainsley for us and since
UVob8FMT6Rk,15023840,15029040,it's so obvious i'll just point out  there's a very large man off to your uh  over your shoulder there and i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,15029040,15034880,assuming the guy in the red shirt is the  security that we've provided as we  typically do when we send reporters into
UVob8FMT6Rk,15034880,15040720,uh into large crowds like this so no  alarm for anybody watching and he's  amazing and we're thankful for him
UVob8FMT6Rk,15040720,15046560,that's what we definitely are julia  thank you  i want to bring in nbc news  correspondent jacob ward now he's in san
UVob8FMT6Rk,15046560,15052560,francisco as we continue our coverage of  this supreme court decision jake what  are you hearing there what are people
UVob8FMT6Rk,15052560,15058720,telling you how are they reacting to  today's decision  well northern california as you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,15058720,15065279,aaron is in many ways the future of the  post row versus wade world you have
UVob8FMT6Rk,15065279,15071279,enormous access to reproductive choice  and reproductive health services here  and yet when we spoke to people this
UVob8FMT6Rk,15071279,15076640,morning approaching them to say would  you like to give us your reaction to  today's decision it was just very hard
UVob8FMT6Rk,15076640,15082000,people very very emotional very very  gutted feeling dislocated from what they
UVob8FMT6Rk,15082000,15087040,say is increasingly politically charged  supreme court here's how one person
UVob8FMT6Rk,15087040,15094560,described her reaction to this decision  i'm outraged
UVob8FMT6Rk,15094560,15100960,i am outraged  and  i feel like i got punched in the stomach
UVob8FMT6Rk,15100960,15107359,this morning  [Music]  they took away a constitutional right
UVob8FMT6Rk,15107359,15113760,for half of the people in this country  and this court is a political machine  and it is not acting in the will of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15113760,15119840,people and its decisions are overturning  hundreds of years of law hundreds of
UVob8FMT6Rk,15119840,15125520,years for gun control  over 50 years versus roe versus wade and  it is not following the will of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15125520,15131358,people it is not following the  constitution and i am outraged
UVob8FMT6Rk,15131920,15139040,the bay area as you know aaron is a  center of all sorts of academic study  and it is in fact in many ways the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15139040,15144399,national capital on the study of what  happens to people after they are denied
UVob8FMT6Rk,15144399,15151600,an abortion that they've sought out a  big study out of university of  california in san francisco called the  turnaway study followed a thousand women
UVob8FMT6Rk,15151600,15158720,over five years and discovered that by  nearly every measure of well-being  financial spiritual mental health all of
UVob8FMT6Rk,15158720,15165680,it they did far worse when they were  denied an abortion that they sought and  in many cases predicted exactly the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15165680,15170800,outcomes that they were worried about  when they described why they were  seeking those abortions so here just the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15170800,15176560,feeling very very dark from people in  san francisco today aaron jake i do  think it's worth noting though that
UVob8FMT6Rk,15176560,15182560,abortion access in california doesn't  change with today's ruling  what are people in california telling
UVob8FMT6Rk,15182560,15188319,you about that reality for them  well that's absolutely correct in many
UVob8FMT6Rk,15188319,15194319,ways people here that we've spoken to  who are in favor of reproductive choice  say that they're deeply relieved to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,15194319,15201359,in california but they worry of course  about the rest of the country and the  fact that so many people are going to  have to come to california and states
UVob8FMT6Rk,15201359,15207359,with laws like it in order to get the  services they may need here's how one  person we spoke with described her
UVob8FMT6Rk,15207359,15214080,feelings about it  i feel like fortunate to be in  california on in many respects but i
UVob8FMT6Rk,15214080,15220720,feel worried about people who aren't in  california and may not have the same  benefit of you know their state's rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,15220720,15225920,so  just concerned about the direction of  the country in the courts because i  always
UVob8FMT6Rk,15225920,15231438,looked up to the supreme court and  thought that they were objective
UVob8FMT6Rk,15232640,15239520,the extraordinary  flurry of activity we've seen in recent  weeks and even years in anticipation of
UVob8FMT6Rk,15239520,15246080,this is now coming together also aaron  we've seen 13 separate state bills being
UVob8FMT6Rk,15246080,15253760,moved through the state capitol here  some of them enshrining  the right to receive an abortion as a
UVob8FMT6Rk,15253760,15260159,constitutional right under california  state constitution others setting aside  in one case 20 million dollars as a fund
UVob8FMT6Rk,15260159,15265920,for people who need to travel from out  of state to get help here and we've seen  of course abortion providers in
UVob8FMT6Rk,15265920,15272319,california preparing for a massive  influx of influx of out-of-state  patients planned parenthood of northern
UVob8FMT6Rk,15272319,15278000,california says that just in this part  of the state alone they have five new  facilities under construction they've
UVob8FMT6Rk,15278000,15283359,been under construction since november  of 2016. when trump took office that was  their first indication that they should
UVob8FMT6Rk,15283359,15289840,get going now the fundraising and the  construction has deepened they say  they're going to be able to take in 500
UVob8FMT6Rk,15289840,15296000,more patients a week once those  facilities are constructed and that's  just up here in northern california and
UVob8FMT6Rk,15296000,15301920,so a big intense emotional but also  preparatory reaction when it comes to
UVob8FMT6Rk,15301920,15307520,the big decision we're all seeing here  all right jake ward for us in san  francisco today jake thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,15307520,15313439,i want to go back to capitol hill now  correspondent ali vitale is joining us  from her post there obviously ali
UVob8FMT6Rk,15313439,15320080,juggling a lot of different topics on  the hill this week and today in  particular but let's stay on this issue  of the supreme court decision what are
UVob8FMT6Rk,15320080,15326880,we hearing from democrats in particular  on the hill today  rage this is a moment that all of them
UVob8FMT6Rk,15326880,15333920,knew was coming because of that leaked  draft opinion nevertheless the rage that  i'm seeing in my text messages in my
UVob8FMT6Rk,15333920,15341120,in-person exchanges with house members  who have been walking by is still so  palpable chuck schumer many of them out
UVob8FMT6Rk,15341120,15347840,of town  chuck schumer the majority leader in  manhattan today talking about it listen  to him
UVob8FMT6Rk,15348319,15354319,today  is one of the darkest days our country  has ever seen
UVob8FMT6Rk,15354319,15360159,millions upon millions upon millions of  american women are having their rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,15360159,15367760,ripped away from them by five unelected  justices on the extremist mega supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,15367760,15376239,court  these justices  these justices appointed by republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,15376239,15383438,residing without any accountability  have stolen a fundamental right
UVob8FMT6Rk,15384239,15390560,there are so many layers to what schumer  was saying there both in terms of how  these justices were confirmed we know
UVob8FMT6Rk,15390560,15396880,that many of them are from the trump  years when he was able to appoint  multiple justices to the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,15396880,15402640,through multiple fraught hearing  processes for each of them schumer  referencing that and then of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,15402640,15408800,democrats here on the hill also just  pushing ahead to november because as  i've been covering this issue both over
UVob8FMT6Rk,15408800,15414640,the course the last few weeks and  frankly for the last few years this is a  moment that democrats and reproductive
UVob8FMT6Rk,15414640,15421120,rights activists have known have been  coming for a very long time they knew  that the states were legislating around
UVob8FMT6Rk,15421120,15427199,this in a way that they hoped to get it  to the supreme court just to tee up a  moment like this and nevertheless they
UVob8FMT6Rk,15427199,15435359,squandered their opportunity to actually  codify the protections that were offered  by roe versus wade back in may when 51
UVob8FMT6Rk,15435359,15441600,lawmakers in the senate including one  democrat joe manchin voted against the  women's health protection act and since
UVob8FMT6Rk,15441600,15447120,then lawmakers here are angry but  they're frankly hamstrung in terms of  what they can do
UVob8FMT6Rk,15447120,15453840,what about on the other side of this  obviously this is something that  republicans have been pushing for on the  hill and hope and obviously they knew
UVob8FMT6Rk,15453840,15460239,the decision was coming so expecting  this what's been the response the  reaction today from republican lawmakers
UVob8FMT6Rk,15460239,15465279,look by and large it has been positive  in that many republicans feel affirmed
UVob8FMT6Rk,15465279,15470319,in their anti-abortion values being seen  by the supreme court today but it's not
UVob8FMT6Rk,15470319,15476399,necessarily uniform senator susan  collins of maine for example releasing a  statement today and i'll read from you
UVob8FMT6Rk,15476399,15482239,in part she says the supreme court has  abandoned a 50-year precedent at a time  that the country is desperate for
UVob8FMT6Rk,15482239,15488479,stability this ill-considered action  will further divide the country at a  moment when more than ever in modern
UVob8FMT6Rk,15488479,15493600,times we need the court to show both  consistency and restraint
UVob8FMT6Rk,15493600,15499600,it makes sense when you hear this coming  from collins this is a precedent that  she repeatedly talked about during
UVob8FMT6Rk,15499600,15505600,supreme court nominating contests but at  the same time it's one that she said for  example during the justice kavanaugh
UVob8FMT6Rk,15505600,15513040,confirmation hearings in 2018 that she  believed him when he said privately to  her that he would continue to uphold the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15513040,15519840,super precedent of row and the other  precedent of casey which is also baked  into this decision now we're hearing
UVob8FMT6Rk,15519840,15526319,from others like joe manchin who also  voted to confirm some of those justices  who have now voted to overturn roe where
UVob8FMT6Rk,15526319,15531520,they're saying that they are  disappointed and that they were misled  by some of these judges and it sort of
UVob8FMT6Rk,15531520,15537279,speaks to the entire theater that is the  supreme court nominating process there  was a discussion about this after the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15537279,15543680,katanji brown jackson confirmation  hearings how or if this process should  change because really the unspoken thing
UVob8FMT6Rk,15543680,15549920,about it is that every judge who lands  there especially on the conservative  side the people nominating them know
UVob8FMT6Rk,15549920,15555359,where they stand on this issue but when  they go before the senate for  confirmations they can't explicitly talk
UVob8FMT6Rk,15555359,15560960,about it they find ways to go around it  and it lands us in moments like this one  where senators confirm them believing
UVob8FMT6Rk,15560960,15566319,that they'll uphold these precedents and  then you end up here  i do want to ask you about the other
UVob8FMT6Rk,15566319,15572080,breaking story we're following today  allie an extremely consequential one i  think the house has passed this
UVob8FMT6Rk,15572080,15577359,landmark gun legislation that was  approved in the senate yesterday do we  know sort of where that goes from here
UVob8FMT6Rk,15577359,15583680,when the president might sign it into  law  i mean what a day of juxtaposing  emotions if you're a democrat especially
UVob8FMT6Rk,15583680,15590319,in the house and the senate right now  because on the one hand you have the  fall of roe which is again an issue that
UVob8FMT6Rk,15590319,15596239,has them enraged and upset and then on  the other side of this you have the most  significant gun legislation that's been
UVob8FMT6Rk,15596239,15601439,passed in 30 years the result of weeks  of bipartisan negotiations in the senate
UVob8FMT6Rk,15601439,15607600,and you'll see why i mean on the other  side of your screen you can see what's  in this bill it's things that  republicans have wanted like investments
UVob8FMT6Rk,15607600,15613359,in mental health and school safety it's  things that democrats have wanted which  is  making some changes to the background
UVob8FMT6Rk,15613359,15620319,check system closing the so-called  boyfriend loophole no one is perfectly  happy but everyone got some of what they
UVob8FMT6Rk,15620319,15626880,wanted in these negotiations that's how  compromise goes the house passing that  today in bipartisan fashion as well
UVob8FMT6Rk,15626880,15633359,sending it to the president's desk and  again that's a moment of jubilation on  one issue while at the same time they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,15633359,15639359,dealing with devastation on another  all right uh ali vitale for us on  capitol hill today covering both of
UVob8FMT6Rk,15639359,15645199,these important topics ally thank you i  do want to turn back to legal analyst  danny cevallos now and nbc news reporter
UVob8FMT6Rk,15645199,15651040,chloe atkins who've been with us sort of  picking apart the decision today and  some of the ramifications of it chloe
UVob8FMT6Rk,15651040,15656640,i'll start with you what sort of  reaction are you hearing you've been  covering this topic for several years  now what are you hearing from your
UVob8FMT6Rk,15656640,15662640,sources and people that you've spoken to  over time yeah i've spoken to people  across the country this week and also
UVob8FMT6Rk,15662640,15668960,this morning and it's safe to say that  emotions are running very high  planned parenthood president alexis
UVob8FMT6Rk,15668960,15674479,mcgill johnson released a statement this  morning  right after we heard about the skoda's
UVob8FMT6Rk,15674479,15681439,ruling and she said it i have it right  here  knowing this moment would come does not  make it less devastating the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,15681439,15687359,court has now given politic politicians  permission to control our bodies now
UVob8FMT6Rk,15687359,15693840,anti-abortion rights groups are  naturally striking a very different tone  this is something that they have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,15693840,15699439,doing  for  you know nearly 50 years they have been  attempting to chip away at abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,15699439,15704880,access at the state ledge and push  through a law  that is now mississippi that was the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15704880,15710319,vehicle to overturn roe v wade and we  heard from susan b anthony list's
UVob8FMT6Rk,15710319,15715680,president and they said an entirely new  pro-life movement begins today
UVob8FMT6Rk,15715680,15721120,over the next few years we will save  hundreds of lives so erin we are seeing
UVob8FMT6Rk,15721120,15728000,strong reaction from people on both  sides of this issue and i'm sure they  will continue to weigh in on the coming  days all right chloe we appreciate that
UVob8FMT6Rk,15728000,15733040,danny i do want to talk to you a little  bit more about sort of the consequences  beyond roe if we can
UVob8FMT6Rk,15733040,15740479,you you've noted that the justice thomas  uh indicated that the court needs to  take another look at cases like oberfeld
UVob8FMT6Rk,15740479,15746560,the the same-sex marriage case that went  before the court  does putting that language in a decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,15746560,15752080,like this start to signal to lawyers and  legislatures around the country all  right now it's time to come up with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,15752080,15758159,case to challenge these things and and  the laws might change the the decisions  from the court might might change in
UVob8FMT6Rk,15758159,15764319,terms of striking down the right to  same-sex marriage yeah justin justice  thomas often gets discounted he's
UVob8FMT6Rk,15764319,15770640,thought of as writing these more extreme  concurring or dissenting opinions but  consider this for a leader to have
UVob8FMT6Rk,15770640,15777199,written the opinion presumably justice  thomas was the senior most uh justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,15777199,15782880,on the bench who would have concurred  with that opinion he would have assigned  alito the opinion so justice thomas
UVob8FMT6Rk,15782880,15790399,arguably has some power in this area and  if he ends up with the majority some of  his uh positions on reevaluating cases
UVob8FMT6Rk,15790399,15795600,like obergefell or any of the others  that he mentioned could be a real real
UVob8FMT6Rk,15795600,15802319,possibility and it just is so striking  because alito again i'm repeating myself  goes to such pains to say this is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15802319,15808640,only thing that we're dealing with today  but if you are going to look at some of  those other entrenched rights griswold
UVob8FMT6Rk,15808640,15816159,which has to do with griswold is the  case that uh that arguably was  poorly reasoned but it goes to
UVob8FMT6Rk,15816159,15822319,contraception to the right of married  couples in their home to use  contraception and an interesting fact
UVob8FMT6Rk,15822319,15829359,even at the time of griswold the  connecticut legislature was actually  pushing to  do away with that law because it was a
UVob8FMT6Rk,15829359,15836399,silly law it didn't make a lot of sense  but yet because the supreme court  grafted this right it from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15836399,15843920,constitution onto the populace it became  controversial and by the way even  justice ruth bader ginsburg recognized
UVob8FMT6Rk,15843920,15849199,that roe was problematic because it  created a right it took that power away
UVob8FMT6Rk,15849199,15855120,from the state legislatures and created  a controversy when  at the time
UVob8FMT6Rk,15855120,15860239,state legislatures were kind of moving  towards liberalizing  abortion that you didn't have the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15860239,15867120,evangelical push then that you do today  now obviously i wasn't there i can't  take my take the pulse of what was going
UVob8FMT6Rk,15867120,15874800,on in america at the time but uh justice  ginsburg other liberal thinkers mark  tuschnet have all criticized roe so in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,15874800,15881600,sense we knew this was coming does it  mean that substantive due process the  idea that unenumerated rights in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15881600,15887040,constitution are dead going forward i  don't know that could go either way
UVob8FMT6Rk,15887040,15892960,maybe they are dead and the only thing  keeping them alive is reliant interest  that we've you we've relied on them for
UVob8FMT6Rk,15892960,15898399,a while but then again a lot of people  relied on roe for a long time yeah all  right you you post some interesting
UVob8FMT6Rk,15898399,15904479,thoughts there and obviously it's gonna  be something to watch over time danny  chloe you're gonna stick with us here as  we continue our coverage this afternoon
UVob8FMT6Rk,15904479,15910800,joining me now is kristen day executive  director of democrats for life of  america uh miss day we appreciate you
UVob8FMT6Rk,15910800,15916080,making some time for us uh you you  tweeted earlier today and we'll put it  up on the screen
UVob8FMT6Rk,15916080,15923120,for our viewers that quote abortion  activists are responsible for the road  for road being overturned uh they
UVob8FMT6Rk,15923120,15929680,overstepped by celebrating abortion and  advocating for it for up to nine months  the democratic party embraced these
UVob8FMT6Rk,15929680,15936239,extremists leading to the republican  majorities all over the country uh  there's some few research that shows six
UVob8FMT6Rk,15936239,15943520,in 10 americans say abortion should be  legal in all or most cases  what do you see as as extremists
UVob8FMT6Rk,15943520,15950000,right so a lot of the states such as  colorado  and new jersey and new york and even
UVob8FMT6Rk,15950000,15955840,virginia have been pushing the uh the  limits to abortion up to nine months and
UVob8FMT6Rk,15955840,15961520,celebrating abortion where a majority of  americans as you said  support reasonable limitations and
UVob8FMT6Rk,15961520,15966640,reasonable health and safety regulations  of abortion  by the democratic party embracing this
UVob8FMT6Rk,15966640,15972479,extreme agenda they have pushed people  out of the party and they have silenced  people within the party from speaking
UVob8FMT6Rk,15972479,15978000,out on reasonable regulation of abortion  and so we've seen that's what led to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,15978000,15983120,senate going into the republican hands  because people wanted roe v wade to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,15983120,15990000,overturned they wanted the abortion  decision to go back to the states  and  even though there are 21 million
UVob8FMT6Rk,15990000,15996640,pro-life democrats out there they are  celebrating today that roe is overturned  so so what should be done how does your
UVob8FMT6Rk,15996640,16003120,group plan to support pregnant women who  who no longer have access to abortion  who might want it
UVob8FMT6Rk,16003120,16009359,we have been advocating for that for  decades uh we we supported the  affordable care act and advocated to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16009359,16014880,eliminate  pregnancy as a pre-existing condition we  also had the pregnancy assistance fund
UVob8FMT6Rk,16014880,16022159,which was included in the aca to provide  grants to states to provide support  again to pregnant women we advocate for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16022159,16027439,paid leave we advocate for child um you  know support for families through the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16027439,16033600,child care tax credit  uh and i think this overturning row  opens up a huge opportunity for our
UVob8FMT6Rk,16033600,16040319,nation to really refocus our efforts not  on whether abortion should be legal or  illegal but what more can we do to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16040319,16045359,provide women with a real choice to have  the baby instead of abortion because we
UVob8FMT6Rk,16045359,16050720,have this really  you know in california and new jersey  the abortion rates are really high and
UVob8FMT6Rk,16050720,16056560,other states they're lower every state  is going to have a challenge but the  unified thing that every state has to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,16056560,16062560,is  support pregnant women giving them the  opportunity  to carry that child to term and and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16062560,16068000,support to care to for to care for their  families  we need to refocus our country well and
UVob8FMT6Rk,16068000,16073520,when you look at conservative states  though maybe perhaps places where these  trigger laws exist
UVob8FMT6Rk,16073520,16080479,is it your expectation that there will  be this sort of support for women who  will no longer have access
UVob8FMT6Rk,16080479,16086080,that is something that we are really  pushing for we were happy when texas  passed their law that they also
UVob8FMT6Rk,16086080,16092640,increased the funding for the  alternatives to abortion program we are  also working arkansas passed the every
UVob8FMT6Rk,16092640,16100159,mother matters act which makes sure that  every pregnant woman is put in touch  with the resources available to them to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16100159,16106479,carry their child to term so we are  advocating in states both blue and red  states for uh the challenges that lie
UVob8FMT6Rk,16106479,16112880,ahead  and we are um we just strongly believe  that women should have the real choice
UVob8FMT6Rk,16112880,16118720,to carry that children to term because  according to the gupmaker institute's  own numbers most women choose abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16118720,16126239,because of financial reasons or  pressure from from someone and with  these new withdrawal being overturned we
UVob8FMT6Rk,16126239,16133120,face these new challenges to make sure  that every woman has the support  necessary all right kristen day from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16133120,16138479,democrats for life of america we  appreciate your time today thank you  thank you so much
UVob8FMT6Rk,16138479,16145520,i want to bring in c.k hoffler now chair  of the rainbow push coalition she's also  a veteran trial lawyer uh ck how's your
UVob8FMT6Rk,16145520,16151920,organization responding to the ruling  today what are your members telling you  well we're devastated we just came off
UVob8FMT6Rk,16151920,16159279,of a conference where we addressed this  very issue of course we knew this  opinion was coming but there's nothing  like this opinion actually getting here
UVob8FMT6Rk,16159279,16166319,um you know this the overturning of roe  versus wade is going to impact  legions of black and brown women and
UVob8FMT6Rk,16166319,16171760,poor women because if you don't have the  ability to get on a plane and you want  to have an abortion you need to have an
UVob8FMT6Rk,16171760,16177680,abortion there are many reasons why  women need to have abortions and if you  can't get to another jurisdiction that
UVob8FMT6Rk,16177680,16183840,would allow you to do it legally then  you're going to be trapped you're going  to feel that your rights have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,16183840,16189600,infringed upon you're going to feel you  don't have options and you might turn to  something that is devastating this if
UVob8FMT6Rk,16189600,16196800,you the reality of the overturning of  roe versus wade is that women today have  less rights than their mothers had
UVob8FMT6Rk,16196800,16202800,that's devastating in black and brown  women are going to be really impacted
UVob8FMT6Rk,16202800,16209680,all right ck hoffler we appreciate your  time today thank you for joining us  now millions of women across the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,16209680,16215199,are reeling as we've been talking about  from the supreme court's decision that  overturns roe v wade some women in
UVob8FMT6Rk,16215199,16221760,states that have already enacted  stricter abortion laws are traveling to  mexico to obtain the procedure abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16221760,16227920,providers there say they've seen a  measurable increase in americans coming  in nbc news now anchor morgan radford
UVob8FMT6Rk,16227920,16235279,visited one of the few remaining  abortion clinics on the border  for many women dr franz fiard is their
UVob8FMT6Rk,16235279,16242479,last chance his new mexico practice is  one of just a few remaining abortion  clinics along the u.s mexico border just
UVob8FMT6Rk,16242479,16247520,one mile west of the texas state line  we've increased by 100
UVob8FMT6Rk,16247520,16254319,so we do about 250 a month now abortions  per month per month  that jumped since last september when a
UVob8FMT6Rk,16254319,16261760,texas law banned abortions as early as  six weeks into pregnancy before that the  state allowed them up to 20 weeks not
UVob8FMT6Rk,16261760,16268000,doing an abortion because you six weeks  or five weeks  is almost like not doing abortions at
UVob8FMT6Rk,16268000,16274960,all  but some of those who can't find the  help they're looking for across state  lines are leaving the country entirely
UVob8FMT6Rk,16274960,16281199,many american women are coming here to  mexico to buy abortion pills the most  commonly used does not require
UVob8FMT6Rk,16281199,16287120,prescription and costs about a tenth of  the price we're about to meet two women  who provide abortion services out of
UVob8FMT6Rk,16287120,16292399,their home here in mexico  just outside of monterrey activists
UVob8FMT6Rk,16292399,16298080,vanessa jimenez and sandra cardona  founded la porteria  where they provide the abortion-inducing
UVob8FMT6Rk,16298080,16304960,drug misoprostol and guide women on how  to take it they say they've seen a  dramatic surge of american clients since
UVob8FMT6Rk,16304960,16308560,the texas law went into effect
UVob8FMT6Rk,16311520,16319120,so before you were seeing two to three  american women a year now you're seeing  five american women a week
UVob8FMT6Rk,16319199,16326318,and sometimes  and where are they coming from  specifically
UVob8FMT6Rk,16328159,16334000,so the majority of women you're seeing  are coming from texas but you're saying  you'll also meet women who are coming to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16334000,16340560,mexico on vacation from ohio sometimes  you see women coming from oklahoma  various states and they're not alone
UVob8FMT6Rk,16340560,16346960,another mexican organization which  opened its doors in january says  americans now make up 25 percent of its
UVob8FMT6Rk,16346960,16352239,customers  what do you all do here
UVob8FMT6Rk,16352800,16359199,so the bottom line is you all are  companions you're helpers you basically  shepherd women through the abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16359199,16366800,process and so you're here to tell them  you're not going to die  and you will not be penalized
UVob8FMT6Rk,16367680,16372479,can you give me an example what are the  women coming from texas tell you
UVob8FMT6Rk,16374319,16380080,what you notice from the women coming  from texas is that they are so scared  they're so scared to even ask for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16380080,16386719,information back home that when they  come here they can't even say the word  abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16387520,16394799,it's fear not only of going to jail but  the economic penalties  a fear that's driving many women even
UVob8FMT6Rk,16394799,16402000,further from home how are people  contacting you how do they find out  about your services
UVob8FMT6Rk,16407199,16413520,you're saying you all started it it  started from social media people found  out when you put up a facebook page and
UVob8FMT6Rk,16413520,16419279,so they're finding you through social  media and so you're saying this is also  spreading by word of mouth people trust
UVob8FMT6Rk,16419279,16423561,each other and they're sharing this  information
UVob8FMT6Rk,16424561,16430240,noon on the west coast 3 p.m here at nbc  news headquarters in new york i'm aaron  gilchrist and the breaking news this
UVob8FMT6Rk,16430240,16437199,hour we're covering one of the most  consequential legal decisions in recent  memory the supreme court has overturned
UVob8FMT6Rk,16437199,16445119,roe v wade  for the first time in half a century  american women no longer have a  constitutional right to an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16445119,16451600,justices thomas gorsuch kavanaugh and  barrett upholding the mississippi law at  the center of this case brought before
UVob8FMT6Rk,16451600,16456719,the court  chief justice john roberts however wrote  his own separate concurring opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16456719,16463600,saying that the court should not have  overturned roe in its decision  justices breyer sotomayor and kagan
UVob8FMT6Rk,16463600,16468719,dissented and a short time ago we did  hear from president biden
UVob8FMT6Rk,16468719,16474959,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,16474959,16481119,nation  are now at risk it's a realization of an  extreme ideology and a tragic error by
UVob8FMT6Rk,16481119,16486480,the supreme court in my view  the court has done what it has never  done before
UVob8FMT6Rk,16486480,16491680,expressly take away a constitutional  right  that is so fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,16491680,16498480,to so many americans  now the street sidewalk outside the  supreme court now the epicenter for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16498480,16505039,demonstrators on both sides of this  issue this is what it looks like right  now 3a 3 p.m now on the east coast
UVob8FMT6Rk,16505039,16511359,outside the court a lot of people there  are outraged and some of them are  overjoyed
UVob8FMT6Rk,16512160,16517279,how did you feel  about the overturn how do you think i  felt man
UVob8FMT6Rk,16517279,16522480,this is amazing  this is probably the best day of  american history in my lifetime at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16522480,16528240,end of the day human rights begin at  conception that they end at natural  death and that's what we're fighting for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16528240,16534160,i honestly don't think the young people  who are  elated at this moment understand what
UVob8FMT6Rk,16534160,16539439,they've done or what has been done to  them the pro-life people who are out
UVob8FMT6Rk,16539439,16545760,here contradict themselves in everything  that they do they are not pro-life  they're pro-hypocrisy pro-birth and
UVob8FMT6Rk,16545760,16553199,pro-control  now with roe now overturned half of the  50 states are certain or likely to ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,16553199,16559600,abortions within their borders leading  us off this hour nbc's ken dolanian in  washington today ken it's been about
UVob8FMT6Rk,16559600,16566000,five hours now since we got this  decision from the court what are some of  your big takeaways from the opinion we
UVob8FMT6Rk,16566000,16571520,received today  hey aaron well look as a layperson a  non-lawyer reading this opinion and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16571520,16578080,dissent what strikes me really is how  profoundly different these two groups of  mostly ivy league educated scholars
UVob8FMT6Rk,16578080,16584561,these justices view the constitution the  majority rightly says that the right to  abortion is nowhere mentioned in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16584561,16590240,constitution and they say that the  ruling in row that the due process  clause of the 14th amendment to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16590240,16595840,constitution provides a fundamental  right to privacy which protects a  pregnant woman's right to abortion they
UVob8FMT6Rk,16595840,16602400,say that was fundamentally wrong because  the people who wrote the 14th amendment  in 1868 didn't see it that way and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16602400,16608400,liberal justices and their dissent  retort yeah that's right it's also worth  remembering that all of those people
UVob8FMT6Rk,16608400,16614400,were men  it goes back to this long debate that  we've had in this country whether the  constitution is a living document or
UVob8FMT6Rk,16614400,16619920,whether it only means what the people  who wrote it thought it meant and right  now the latter view holds sway on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16619920,16625600,supreme court  ken there's also some important context  about this ruling from chief justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,16625600,16631920,john roberts can you explain what he  said in his concurrent opinion  yeah roberts tried to strike a middle
UVob8FMT6Rk,16631920,16637199,ground here unsuccessfully and he's an  institutionalist and he's clearly  worried about the effect that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,16637199,16643199,decision will have on the perceived  legitimacy of the court he wrote in his  separate opinion that the court's
UVob8FMT6Rk,16643199,16648400,decision to overrule roe and casey is a  serious joel to the legal system
UVob8FMT6Rk,16648400,16654799,regardless of how you view those cases  he added a narrower decision rejecting  the misguided viability line that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,16654799,16660959,about when a fetus is viable would be  markedly less unsettling  and nothing more is needed to decide
UVob8FMT6Rk,16660959,16667039,this case in other words we he said we  didn't have to do this but his view did  not hold sway among the majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,16667039,16673600,so ken as we've been discussing this  ruling returns power over regulating  abortions to the states right what
UVob8FMT6Rk,16673600,16680400,options does the federal government have  to sort of help women who want to be  able to obtain an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16680400,16686080,erin attorney general merrick garland  laid out some of that in a detailed  statement today he said the justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,16686080,16691760,department will continue to protect  health care providers and individuals  seeking reproductive health services in
UVob8FMT6Rk,16691760,16698400,states where those services remain legal  he noted that federal law prohibits  anyone from obstructing access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16698400,16704000,reproductive health services through  violence threats of violence or property  damage and he also noted that the fda
UVob8FMT6Rk,16704000,16710080,has approved the use of a medical  abortion drug called myth of prestone  and he said that states may not ban that
UVob8FMT6Rk,16710080,16716639,drug just simply if they disagree with  the fda's expert judgment about its  safety and efficacy so the justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,16716639,16721760,department does plan to get involved in  these issues there all right ken delaney  and for us in washington today ken we
UVob8FMT6Rk,16721760,16727520,appreciate your reporting on this thank  you  now the impact of this decision  obviously is being felt across the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16727520,16734480,country today nbc news correspondent  dasha burns is in kent county michigan  for us today dasha i know you spoke to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16734480,16741359,some women who are just learning of  today's news what sort of reaction are  you hearing there
UVob8FMT6Rk,16742080,16748320,well erin abortion rights are in a  precarious place right now here in the  state of michigan because while michigan
UVob8FMT6Rk,16748320,16753359,doesn't have the sort of trigger laws  that we've been talking about in some of  the red states in the south this state
UVob8FMT6Rk,16753359,16758879,does have a kind of zombie law this 1931  law that's been on the books but lay
UVob8FMT6Rk,16758879,16764480,dormant after  roe was went into effect now that row
UVob8FMT6Rk,16764480,16770879,has been overturned this law could once  again come into effect right now there's  been a court injunction that has
UVob8FMT6Rk,16770879,16777280,prevented it from from taking effect  right this moment but this law  criminalizes abortion with no exception
UVob8FMT6Rk,16777280,16782718,so the folks here the women in this in  this state the people in this state who  are
UVob8FMT6Rk,16782718,16789120,for abortion rights they are extremely  concerned about what could happen in the  coming weeks here as the state's
UVob8FMT6Rk,16789120,16796480,republican-held legislature is fighting  to defend that law to keep that  anti-abortion law in place and i want
UVob8FMT6Rk,16796480,16802718,you to hear from one of the women i  spoke with today her name is katie morse  she actually was a lifelong republican
UVob8FMT6Rk,16802718,16809120,until 2020 when she cast her vote for a  democrat for the very first time and she  told me that she is
UVob8FMT6Rk,16809120,16815600,surprised and concerned about what all  of this means take a listen
UVob8FMT6Rk,16815600,16820958,i'm concerned we're starting to see the  downfall of america at this point and  we're taking strong words taking rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,16820958,16827920,away from people is a really big deal  and how do we get those rights back i  feel  and anger
UVob8FMT6Rk,16827920,16833840,because  this has nothing to do with the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16833840,16839040,constitution  this has to do  with
UVob8FMT6Rk,16839040,16845200,a cabal of people that think they can  i'm sorry how do they have the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,16845200,16853042,to tell me  or any woman  what she  can do with her body
UVob8FMT6Rk,16853760,16860718,and erin that woman you just heard from  last there virginia de haan we didn't  find her she actually found us she was
UVob8FMT6Rk,16860718,16866240,walking around downtown grand rapids  looking for something to do  someone to talk to about this she came
UVob8FMT6Rk,16866240,16872160,up to us  in tears this historic day clearly  deeply personal deeply emotional for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16872160,16877760,people aaron  yeah this is sort of mind-blowing the  decision for so many people trying to
UVob8FMT6Rk,16877760,16885280,think through it and understand it  better dasha  there was a recent court order in  michigan that delays the banning of
UVob8FMT6Rk,16885280,16890718,abortions there so can you sort of  square today's supreme court decision  with with that order what happens for
UVob8FMT6Rk,16890718,16896000,women in michigan now  well we're waiting for the michigan
UVob8FMT6Rk,16896000,16902718,supreme court to rule on this they  placed an injunction on that law i  mentioned that 1931 law banning abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,16902718,16909680,so right now abortion providers can  continue to do what they're doing but  we're waiting on that final ruling over
UVob8FMT6Rk,16909680,16915200,whether or not that 1931 law is invalid  governor gretchen whitmer has asked as
UVob8FMT6Rk,16915200,16922320,of today at one o'clock today asked the  michigan supreme court to expedite  that process and that decision but in
UVob8FMT6Rk,16922320,16928560,this conversation in this press briefing  that attorney general dana nessel held  today she talked about how
UVob8FMT6Rk,16928560,16934718,we've seen what we've learned today is  that court rulings they can be  overturned they are not necessarily
UVob8FMT6Rk,16934718,16940160,permanent even for certain cases certain  rulings that we you know thought would
UVob8FMT6Rk,16940160,16946638,last  would have lasting power take a listen  to just some of what she said today
UVob8FMT6Rk,16946638,16951840,what i have pledged is this  i am not going to seek
UVob8FMT6Rk,16951840,16957200,to  discipline  to suspend to revoke the license of any
UVob8FMT6Rk,16957200,16963360,medical professional who is properly  trained uh in uh performing abortions or
UVob8FMT6Rk,16963360,16969040,prescribing abortion medication and then  who proceeds to do that um
UVob8FMT6Rk,16969040,16975600,i i will not involve my office in that  um and as i've indicated before of  course neither will i enforce this
UVob8FMT6Rk,16975600,16981760,draconian 1931 law that i think will  hurt so many people in our state
UVob8FMT6Rk,16982480,16988000,and while the attorney general and the  governor are hopeful that the supreme  court will rule in their favor here the
UVob8FMT6Rk,16988000,16994480,attorney general said that the the best  way that voters who are for abortion  rights can sort of enshrine
UVob8FMT6Rk,16994480,17001200,those rights is by pushing through a  ballot proposal that would be on the  november ballot and coming out to vote
UVob8FMT6Rk,17001200,17007520,for that which would uh help put those  rights into the michigan constitution  something that uh takes it out of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17007520,17012718,hands of the courts and uh into the  power of the people aaron and dr you and  i've been talking about this issue in
UVob8FMT6Rk,17012718,17018400,michigan in particular for for a couple  days this week michigan we know has one  of the the highest number of abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,17018400,17024718,procedures in the country  could that state is that state prepared  to see an influx of women seeking
UVob8FMT6Rk,17024718,17030240,abortion given the comments that we  heard from the attorney general today
UVob8FMT6Rk,17030400,17035600,right well this is where it's  interesting right where  we're talking about this as now what an
UVob8FMT6Rk,17035600,17042240,issue that has come down to states state  by state making this decision but it's  not only a state a single state issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,17042240,17047600,because we've already seen this  happening in the south where you've seen  some of these stricter abortion laws put
UVob8FMT6Rk,17047600,17052718,in place in texas and other states and  people are crossing state lines to seek
UVob8FMT6Rk,17052718,17059200,care in other states and michigan has  already been seeing that from ohio from  indiana and absolutely uh they are
UVob8FMT6Rk,17059200,17065680,expecting that that will increase so  long as abortion rights here in michigan  uh are are available so it's not a
UVob8FMT6Rk,17065680,17071600,single state issue this is an inter and  intra  state issue and a federal issue as we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,17071600,17077760,been talking about as well erin  all right dasha burns for us in michigan  today dasha thank you we appreciate it
UVob8FMT6Rk,17077760,17084400,here with me in studio now is nbc news  legal analyst danny cevallos also with  us nbc news reporter chloe atkins who's
UVob8FMT6Rk,17084400,17090560,been covering the issue of abortion  closely for some time now  and danny i want to start with you on
UVob8FMT6Rk,17090560,17096560,some of the legal questions here right  can you help us to understand the legal  argument that the justices are making in
UVob8FMT6Rk,17096560,17102958,in this decision that's overturning roe  let's start with an easy quick one  justice roberts he signaled signaled
UVob8FMT6Rk,17102958,17108878,this throughout oral argument and  essentially what justice roberts says is  he's concurring he's going along with
UVob8FMT6Rk,17108878,17114160,the majority but he really only wanted  to discuss the viability test that line
UVob8FMT6Rk,17114160,17120878,that he says was this arbitrary line in  the sand that the rowan casey court kind  of plucked out of the air created out of
UVob8FMT6Rk,17120878,17127520,whole cloth indeed he says the litigants  in those cases weren't really even  asking for a line at viability it's the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17127520,17134240,court that came up with it and it came  up with it in a way that really isn't in  the spirit it's like a regulation the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17134240,17141440,kind of thing that the executive branch  or the legislature should make not the  court so to justice roberts it was about
UVob8FMT6Rk,17141440,17147840,maybe doing away with viability but  since the closest in agreement with him  was the majority he's essentially
UVob8FMT6Rk,17147840,17152878,concurring with the majority the actual  majority opinion pretty much the same as
UVob8FMT6Rk,17152878,17158878,it was several months ago when it was  leaked and it basically concludes  that row and casey
UVob8FMT6Rk,17158878,17165600,were wrongly decided they were wrongly  decided and they should not stand under  the idea of starry decisis starry
UVob8FMT6Rk,17165600,17172798,decisis is the idea that we follow  precedent we respect what prior courts  have decided and use those to guide us
UVob8FMT6Rk,17172798,17178400,forward and follow them and consider  them binding well the supreme court  doesn't have to always consider things
UVob8FMT6Rk,17178400,17185920,binding it can overrule its own  precedent it has in the past plessy v  ferguson cases that were egregiously
UVob8FMT6Rk,17185920,17191200,wrong were revisited and overturned the  court has to be able to overturn  precedent and when it comes to
UVob8FMT6Rk,17191200,17197840,constitutional issues the principles of  starry decisis are at their weakest in  other words when it's the constitution
UVob8FMT6Rk,17197840,17202958,that's the time to revisit it and it  does and it says that uh this is was
UVob8FMT6Rk,17202958,17208798,wrong  egregiously wrong when it was decided  it's unworkable and even though people
UVob8FMT6Rk,17208798,17215200,have known about it for decades there  isn't enough reliance there isn't enough  in the history and traditions to keep
UVob8FMT6Rk,17215200,17220400,this uh to keep this constitutional  right and so they are striking it down
UVob8FMT6Rk,17220400,17227280,remarkable because the supreme court  over overrules itself the supreme court  uh undues precedent it doesn't often
UVob8FMT6Rk,17227280,17233600,undo a constitutional right in other  words the supreme court doesn't often  giveth a constitutional right and then
UVob8FMT6Rk,17233600,17239360,taketh it away okay i do want to  actually come back to that with you this  this idea of president but chloe first
UVob8FMT6Rk,17239360,17246160,you know i i want to talk a little bit  more about the practical application of  this issue right i think we have some  numbers we can put up on the screen we
UVob8FMT6Rk,17246160,17252560,know that 26 states are either certain  or likely to ban abortion  because of the supreme court's decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,17252560,17258240,today half of those already have trigger  laws in place  what does life for millions of women in
UVob8FMT6Rk,17258240,17265440,this country look like now without roe  based on the reporting that you've been  able to do over time that's right erin
UVob8FMT6Rk,17265440,17270718,life for millions of women across this  country looks very different
UVob8FMT6Rk,17270718,17277280,today than it did yesterday so with roe  v wade being overturned you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,17277280,17284798,regulation of abortion goes back to the  states like you just mentioned 26 states  are poised to ban abortion entirely or
UVob8FMT6Rk,17284798,17289920,um in some way shape or form in a very  strict uh form excuse me and so what we
UVob8FMT6Rk,17289920,17296718,will see is we will see an emergence of  a tale of two countries huge swaths of  the south and midwest will be no one
UVob8FMT6Rk,17296718,17302958,will have access there and then in  liberal leaning coastal states that is  where people will be able to travel to
UVob8FMT6Rk,17302958,17310240,to get care or will be able to have a  lot of accessible abortion access and  that state so we are seeing a huge
UVob8FMT6Rk,17310240,17316480,stark difference in what reality looks  like and it truly is dependent on your  zip code and being able to access that
UVob8FMT6Rk,17316480,17323280,care  danny i want to go back to this to  precedent right i think for those of us  who are not legal minds lay folks we we
UVob8FMT6Rk,17323280,17328560,hear that term and we know what it you  know how you define it in the dictionary  but
UVob8FMT6Rk,17328560,17335680,as you've suggested in practice  we can't help but wonder does it not  really mean anything if after 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,17335680,17341360,president that's been sort of president  on top of president on top of president  over such a long period of time how is
UVob8FMT6Rk,17341360,17347600,it that it just  goes away is that there's a conversation  that that happens among the judges and
UVob8FMT6Rk,17347600,17354000,it ends with oh well the precedent  that's been in place for so long in this  case  doesn't matter a couple of reasons and
UVob8FMT6Rk,17354000,17359120,this is according to the majority it's  that uh constitutional issues are worthy
UVob8FMT6Rk,17359120,17364878,of revisiting in other words if they  weren't then the first court would have  the first and final say on all
UVob8FMT6Rk,17364878,17372400,constitutional issues and that can't be  the case uh according to the court and  in addition they are the majority argues
UVob8FMT6Rk,17372400,17378718,and again i'm describing what the  majority argues here that this is  precedent that has become unworkable in
UVob8FMT6Rk,17378718,17383920,the 50 years since roe v wade was  decided we still don't know what an  undue burden is
UVob8FMT6Rk,17383920,17390718,we still don't know what viability is by  the way viability is also a moving  target arguably because of the way that
UVob8FMT6Rk,17390718,17398160,uh modern medicine advances viability is  defined by the fetus's ability to live  outside the womb if that's the case well
UVob8FMT6Rk,17398160,17406320,viability is something that has changed  dramatically since you know the the  1800s versus today and then
UVob8FMT6Rk,17406320,17412240,strangely enough you know we talk about  evolving ideas about abortion some of  the majority and even robert's opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,17412240,17417600,goes into the idea that look these  evolving ideas
UVob8FMT6Rk,17417600,17424480,have changed the original foundations  that roe was based on i mean the bottom  line here is yes people have been doing
UVob8FMT6Rk,17424480,17430240,it now for decades but the majority  observes that because roe and casey were  so
UVob8FMT6Rk,17430240,17437040,flawed in their decision that they were  always a precarious these were by the  way this was always on the chopping
UVob8FMT6Rk,17437040,17444718,block  not because uh people you know like  abortion or don't like abortion but  because roe was based on shaky reasoning
UVob8FMT6Rk,17444718,17451440,from the beginning again that's not my  opinion that's the late justice  ginsburg's opinion uh that's great
UVob8FMT6Rk,17451440,17457600,leading liberal thinkers uh like  lawrence tribe it's their opinion that  this was something that was flawed from
UVob8FMT6Rk,17457600,17464560,the outset so it was always right to be  attacked the thing that really should  concern folks is that notwithstanding
UVob8FMT6Rk,17464560,17471040,justice alito's  cautions or assurances i should say  that maybe all of these rights that are
UVob8FMT6Rk,17471040,17476480,not enumerated uh are on the chopping  block it could be the case that other of
UVob8FMT6Rk,17476480,17481600,these rights that are that have been  recognized mostly by the warren court in  the 60s
UVob8FMT6Rk,17481600,17486718,that exist i mean could you say that  same-sex marriage is a possibility of
UVob8FMT6Rk,17486718,17492400,being overturned my goodness according  to justice thomas maybe i still don't  think so for a couple reasons the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17492400,17498958,reliance interests are huge they're huge  you would undo families right and you  could argue there's no real push ever
UVob8FMT6Rk,17498958,17504878,since ober obergefell there aren't  marches you know every year against  same-sex marriage there's certainly
UVob8FMT6Rk,17504878,17511440,people who don't like it that are out  there but you don't have this movement  you don't have a president who's  promising to put you know anti-same-sex
UVob8FMT6Rk,17511440,17517280,marriage justices on the court the last  president president trump made that  promise and it looks like he delivered
UVob8FMT6Rk,17517280,17523120,on it yeah  it seems though it wouldn't be  unreasonable to think that with the  language that that justice thomas
UVob8FMT6Rk,17523120,17529280,included in in his writings on this that  some of those  uh some of those other issues same-sex
UVob8FMT6Rk,17529280,17534560,marriage and and and others could  suddenly be  oh a target oh wait there's a there's a
UVob8FMT6Rk,17534560,17540160,line that says maybe we should start  having marches and trying to push for  for i want to ask you to weigh in on
UVob8FMT6Rk,17540160,17546160,that  yeah unless you're inclined to if  there's a legal argument there well  again i'll put on my i'll put on my hat
UVob8FMT6Rk,17546160,17551520,using the reasoning of the conservative  majority here and here's how i think the  reasoning would go because you could
UVob8FMT6Rk,17551520,17557120,make the same argument about obergefell  by the way you can make the exact same  argument about griswold griswold the one
UVob8FMT6Rk,17557120,17564638,that the case that recognized uh uh  private couples right to have  contraceptive devices uh was something
UVob8FMT6Rk,17564638,17570958,that was really poorly decided that's  where we get that language of well  maybe it's in you know the 14th
UVob8FMT6Rk,17570958,17576798,amendment but it kind of glows it's part  of the penumbra of the rights in the  bill of rights and that's the stuff that
UVob8FMT6Rk,17576798,17584240,originalist justices seized on and  conservative thinkers have seized on  because it's kind of flim-flammy it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,17584240,17589360,kind of language that isn't concrete and  it's from those cases griswold
UVob8FMT6Rk,17589360,17595840,that we get the problems that led to roe  in the reasoning which is  you know you can't deny that those words
UVob8FMT6Rk,17595840,17601760,are not in the constitution now does it  mean that we should interpret the  constitution to just evolve yes i do you
UVob8FMT6Rk,17601760,17608878,know i think even conservative justices  recognize that just because something  didn't exist in 1878 or 1776 we adapt
UVob8FMT6Rk,17608878,17616240,with technology but if something wasn't  a right and believe it or not back when  the 14th amendment was uh enacted there
UVob8FMT6Rk,17616240,17621600,were  uh abortions abortion there were rules  on abortions so that's the reasoning of
UVob8FMT6Rk,17621600,17627440,the conservative bloc of the court that  if it wasn't firmly rooted in our  history and traditions then at the time
UVob8FMT6Rk,17627440,17633520,that's not what it uh protected the 14th  amendment so again always on shaky  ground in a way maybe we knew this was

UVob8FMT6Rk,17683760,17689120,different tones um the pro-life movement  has been waiting for this moment in
UVob8FMT6Rk,17689120,17696560,history for over 50 years um like we've  talked about they have taken this  incremental approach at slowly passing
UVob8FMT6Rk,17696560,17702798,restrictions at different points in  pregnancy  enacting waiting periods um to anything
UVob8FMT6Rk,17702798,17707840,really underneath the sun that may stick  now the aclu who has been um you know

UVob8FMT6Rk,17719600,17725040,far-reaching and like i've said before  this isn't the last time we were going  to hear from folks on both sides of the

UVob8FMT6Rk,17742958,17746558,listen to some of his response today
UVob8FMT6Rk,17749200,17755760,they didn't limit it  i simply took it away  that's never been done to a right so
UVob8FMT6Rk,17755760,17762240,important to so many americans  but they did it  it's a sad day for the court and for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17762240,17769120,country  50 years ago  roe v wade  was decided and has been the law of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17769120,17774400,land since then  this landmark case protected a woman's  right to choose
UVob8FMT6Rk,17774400,17780560,her right to make intensely personal  decisions with her doctor  free from the entertainment from the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17780560,17785920,interference of politics  it reaffirmed basic principles of  equality
UVob8FMT6Rk,17785920,17791200,that women have the power to control  their own destiny  and it reinforced a fundamental right of
UVob8FMT6Rk,17791200,17798000,privacy  the right of each of us to choose how to  live our lives
UVob8FMT6Rk,17798000,17804240,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this

UVob8FMT6Rk,17814560,17821200,well aaron we are hearing democrats and  abortion rights advocates echoing the  president's call to action as the
UVob8FMT6Rk,17821200,17826560,president essentially tells americans  and voters that if they want the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,17826560,17832080,to an abortion restored they're going to  have to vote for more lawmakers who are
UVob8FMT6Rk,17832080,17837760,going to support that that there is  nothing the president can do in and of  himself with this you know sweep of a
UVob8FMT6Rk,17837760,17843200,pen or an executive order uh to restore  a right that the supreme court today uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,17843200,17848958,took away and so you heard president  biden joshua interrupt you here vice  president harris is speaking right now

UVob8FMT6Rk,17914480,17920400,air force two  and we traveled here from d.c today to  talk with you about maternal health
UVob8FMT6Rk,17920400,17926320,which should be one of our highest  priorities as a nation  and i had planned to speak about our
UVob8FMT6Rk,17926320,17931360,strategy for improving care  for pregnant women and mothers across
UVob8FMT6Rk,17931360,17936400,our country  and as you know  on the way here
UVob8FMT6Rk,17936400,17941920,however  we learned that the united states  supreme court had rendered its decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,17941920,17947280,in dobbs v jackson women's health  organization
UVob8FMT6Rk,17947280,17954560,here's what that decision means  for nearly 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,17954560,17961122,we have talked about what roe v wade  protects
UVob8FMT6Rk,17961520,17968240,today  as of right now  as of this minute
UVob8FMT6Rk,17968240,17975680,we can only talk  about what roe v wade  protected
UVob8FMT6Rk,17975760,17982878,past tense  this is a health care crisis
UVob8FMT6Rk,17982878,17988878,because understand  millions of women in america
UVob8FMT6Rk,17988878,17995200,will go to bed tonight  without access to the health care and
UVob8FMT6Rk,17995200,18000240,reproductive care  that they had this morning
UVob8FMT6Rk,18000240,18007440,without access to the same health care  or reproductive health care
UVob8FMT6Rk,18007440,18015440,that their mothers  and grandmothers had for 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,18016160,18021200,this is the first time  in the history of our nation
UVob8FMT6Rk,18021200,18026400,that a constitutional right  has been taken
UVob8FMT6Rk,18026400,18035040,from the people of america  and what is that right some might ask
UVob8FMT6Rk,18035040,18042400,it's the right to privacy  think about it  as the right for each person
UVob8FMT6Rk,18042400,18048560,to make intimate decisions  about heart
UVob8FMT6Rk,18048560,18054320,and home  decisions about the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,18054320,18060638,to start a family  including  contraception
UVob8FMT6Rk,18060638,18065760,such as iuds  the morning after pill
UVob8FMT6Rk,18065760,18071120,decisions  about  whether to have a child
UVob8FMT6Rk,18071120,18078320,including as senator durbin mentioned  through  in vitro fertilization
UVob8FMT6Rk,18078320,18083920,decisions  to marry  the person you love
UVob8FMT6Rk,18083920,18091798,obergefell v hodges  loving  versus virginia
UVob8FMT6Rk,18091840,18100080,this opinion  also says when you read it  that abortion is not deeply rooted in
UVob8FMT6Rk,18100080,18105920,our nation's history  they offer that in the opinion as a  foundation
UVob8FMT6Rk,18105920,18111440,for the decision they render today  in holding that
UVob8FMT6Rk,18111440,18116718,it is not deeply rooted in our history  today's decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,18116718,18122480,on that theory  then  calls into question
UVob8FMT6Rk,18122480,18128400,other rights  that we thought were settled
UVob8FMT6Rk,18128400,18133440,such as the right  to use birth control  the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,18133440,18140080,to same-sex marriage  the right  to interracial marriage
UVob8FMT6Rk,18141600,18147600,the great  aspiration of our nation  has been
UVob8FMT6Rk,18147600,18156080,to expand  freedom  but the expansion of freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,18156080,18161718,clearly  is not inevitable
UVob8FMT6Rk,18161920,18167120,it is not something  that just happens
UVob8FMT6Rk,18167120,18174400,not unless  we defend  our most fundamental principles
UVob8FMT6Rk,18174400,18181600,not unless  we elect leaders who stand up  for those principles
UVob8FMT6Rk,18181600,18189600,the strength of our nation has always  been  that we move forward
UVob8FMT6Rk,18189600,18196080,today i invite all people  to stand together
UVob8FMT6Rk,18196160,18201680,in defense of one of the most  fundamental  ideals and principles
UVob8FMT6Rk,18201680,18207920,that for generations  for centuries i believe we had held dear
UVob8FMT6Rk,18207920,18213360,which is that fundamental principle  about the importance of liberty
UVob8FMT6Rk,18213360,18220400,to stand for liberty to stand for  freedom  to stand for self-determination
UVob8FMT6Rk,18220400,18223920,and for the right to privacy
UVob8FMT6Rk,18225680,18232718,you have the power  to elect leaders who will defend and  protect your rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,18232718,18239280,and as the president said earlier today  with your vote you can act
UVob8FMT6Rk,18239280,18246320,and you have the final word  so this is not over
UVob8FMT6Rk,18246320,18250876,god bless you  and god bless america
UVob8FMT6Rk,18255040,18260080,vice president kamala harris speaking  there about the supreme court ruling  today
UVob8FMT6Rk,18260080,18265120,in strong words talking about the  expansion of freedom not being  inevitable
UVob8FMT6Rk,18265120,18271680,as she says that it is now incumbent  upon the citizenry to take action to  change some of the rules some of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,18271680,18278160,laws in different parts of this country  i do want to go to nbc's julia ainslie  she is outside the supreme court for us
UVob8FMT6Rk,18278160,18284000,today where crowds have been gathering  for hours now julia i know you've been  hearing from people on both sides of
UVob8FMT6Rk,18284000,18289680,this debate on abortion here talk to us  about some of the conversations you've  had today and about some of what you're
UVob8FMT6Rk,18289680,18294718,seeing on the ground right now  yeah that's right i mean aaron if you
UVob8FMT6Rk,18294718,18300160,want to know how divided our country is  particularly on this issue look no  further than the crowd i'm standing in
UVob8FMT6Rk,18300160,18305200,right now we have some people here who  are celebrating today they say they're  overjoyed this is something that they've
UVob8FMT6Rk,18305200,18311920,wanted to see for decades then you have  people who are emotionally devastated  trying to come here to fight for what
UVob8FMT6Rk,18311920,18317920,they thought was their constitutionally  protected right so from both the  abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,18317920,18323520,rights advocates and those who are  against abortion we are hearing some
UVob8FMT6Rk,18323520,18329280,really emotional uh opinions and  testimony today we've also increased
UVob8FMT6Rk,18329280,18335600,security here capitol police now  standing in front of the barricade right  in front of the supreme court you're
UVob8FMT6Rk,18335600,18340638,hearing speeches on the right of me  music on the left of me all around here
UVob8FMT6Rk,18340638,18345840,today we've seen bull horns it's it's  really just been growing more tense
UVob8FMT6Rk,18345840,18353440,louder at a thicker crowd by the hour i  spoke to some people today some who we  said were devastated to tears others who
UVob8FMT6Rk,18353440,18359440,were celebrating this as a victory  particularly those  who saw this as a religious victory
UVob8FMT6Rk,18359440,18364798,here's what one of those people had to  tell me  i think for the christian community this
UVob8FMT6Rk,18364798,18371120,is something that we should all believe  in pro-life because god has made us with  a purpose everybody
UVob8FMT6Rk,18371120,18378160,from when they're conceived so  i do believe it's a victory for  christians around the world
UVob8FMT6Rk,18378240,18384480,so you can see for some people this is  something that cuts across religion they  might see it as a religious victory you
UVob8FMT6Rk,18384480,18390958,have people behind me saying that this  is undermining the separation of church  and state that was set in motion by our
UVob8FMT6Rk,18390958,18397600,founding fathers you have other people  who see this as a race issue saying that  people who could be shut out of
UVob8FMT6Rk,18397600,18403920,abortion access now or  disproportionately people of color  people living in rural areas of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,18403920,18409200,country particularly in red states it  also cuts across economic lines people
UVob8FMT6Rk,18409200,18415600,saying that people who now have means  can travel to another state where  abortion is legal but people without
UVob8FMT6Rk,18415600,18420878,means won't be able to it really cuts  across every facet of american identity
UVob8FMT6Rk,18420878,18427520,and we're seeing that on display here  today as the crowd gets more tense and  we've seen a lot of conflicts that both
UVob8FMT6Rk,18427520,18434160,sides have faced off against one another  aaron  all right julie ainsley forrest outside  the supreme court there on capitol hill
UVob8FMT6Rk,18434160,18440798,in washington julia thank you  joining me now is melissa fowler she is  the chief program officer of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,18440798,18448240,national abortion federation which is  the professional association of  proportion abortion providers uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,18448240,18454560,what's happening inside your offices  today i'm wondering what kind of  activities have you all been undertaking
UVob8FMT6Rk,18454560,18460638,what kind of calls have you been getting  sure so  we're absolutely devastated this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,18460638,18467520,heartbreaking day not just for abortion  providers and advocates but for everyone  in this country who has or will ever
UVob8FMT6Rk,18467520,18473040,need to access abortion care and even  though we've been preparing for this  it's still
UVob8FMT6Rk,18473040,18479040,incredibly sad and hard to deal with  we've been reaching out to members  across the country who are facing a lot
UVob8FMT6Rk,18479040,18485360,of different things some people are  dealing with the reality that they have  to start turning patients away and think  about closing
UVob8FMT6Rk,18485360,18491040,some people are trying to  think about scaling up services and  they're expecting to see more patients
UVob8FMT6Rk,18491040,18496400,we run a national toll-free hotline and  we're hearing from people who are  concerned about
UVob8FMT6Rk,18496400,18502480,how they will access care how they will  afford care how they will make the trip  to another state and you know it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,18502480,18508000,important for people to realize that  despite this ruling abortion is still  available it's still legal in many
UVob8FMT6Rk,18508000,18513040,states and there are resources for  people who want to access that care and  people like the national abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,18513040,18519520,federation who can help them do so and i  would imagine  that messaging is part of the  preparation that your organization has
UVob8FMT6Rk,18519520,18525040,been doing knowing that this ruling was  coming can you walk us through a little  bit of that the preparations that you've
UVob8FMT6Rk,18525040,18530160,undertaken so far  sure so you know in some ways we
UVob8FMT6Rk,18530160,18537440,got sort of a dress rehearsal for this  with the texas band last year  at that time we saw a dramatic increase
UVob8FMT6Rk,18537440,18543200,in callers from texas who needed more  assistance who needed to travel out of  state and we've been able to help them
UVob8FMT6Rk,18543200,18548560,either access care quickly or book their  travel and fund their expenses to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,18548560,18554400,able to go to another state so we saw  what that looks like with just one state  and so we've been preparing we've been
UVob8FMT6Rk,18554400,18561360,increasing our staffing  we've been trying to raise more funding  for patient assistance because we know  the need is going to be so much greater
UVob8FMT6Rk,18561360,18566718,because  swaths of the country are going to lose  access and and sadly it is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,18566718,18572160,depend on where you live and how much  money you have whether you can access  the health care you need so we've been
UVob8FMT6Rk,18572160,18578638,preparing for this we've been trying to  make sure that we're supporting our  members those who are going to stay open
UVob8FMT6Rk,18578638,18585520,those who are going to pivot and provide  other services and unfortunately those  who will have to close or think about
UVob8FMT6Rk,18585520,18592638,other options  all right melissa fowler we appreciate  you making some time for us today and  being on with us thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,18592638,18598958,now as we mentioned earlier about half  of u.s states are certain or likely to  ban abortions within their borders one
UVob8FMT6Rk,18598958,18605280,state that just did  is arkansas the state's attorney general  just certified the trigger law there
UVob8FMT6Rk,18605280,18610798,outlawing abortion in arkansas  this decision essentially puts our
UVob8FMT6Rk,18610798,18617200,pro-life laws in place  and allows arkansas to ban abortion with  the only exception being to save the
UVob8FMT6Rk,18617200,18623440,life of a mother  now many people in other states are  celebrating today's supreme court ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,18623440,18629920,as well i want to bring in rebecca parma  now she is a senior legislative  associate for texas right to life uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,18629920,18634958,rebecca we appreciate you being here  today how are members of your  organization reacting to today's
UVob8FMT6Rk,18634958,18641440,decision  yeah thanks for having me and we're  celebrating you know this is something  that the pro-life movement and texas
UVob8FMT6Rk,18641440,18647040,right to life have been working toward  for nearly 50 years and it's a historic  day and one that we're certainly
UVob8FMT6Rk,18647040,18653280,celebrating even as we acknowledge  there's still more work to do  the ruling today virtually eliminates
UVob8FMT6Rk,18653280,18658958,abortion access in in texas for women in  that state who  would have sought an abortion and now
UVob8FMT6Rk,18658958,18664480,can't have one there what resources are  there available to help them
UVob8FMT6Rk,18664480,18671200,outside of getting an abortion  yeah absolutely we have the alternatives  to abortion program here in texas it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,18671200,18676480,been around for about 20 years the  legislature funds this program at 100  million dollars
UVob8FMT6Rk,18676480,18683840,for the next two years and this program  comes alongside women who are pregnant  and and are unsure about if they can
UVob8FMT6Rk,18683840,18690080,keep their pregnancy because of  financial concerns or or educational  concerns anything like that and
UVob8FMT6Rk,18690080,18695520,encourages them to choose life and also  walks alongside them for up to three  years after the birth of their child
UVob8FMT6Rk,18695520,18701760,providing them with social services like  diapers and formula and then counseling  and parenting classes and job skills

UVob8FMT6Rk,18740958,18747680,majority opinion overturning roe v wade  but said  he sees this now as a new president
UVob8FMT6Rk,18747680,18754000,that would allow the courts to  re-examine  uh see you know very significant
UVob8FMT6Rk,18754000,18759600,landmark cases that have already been  decided things looking at
UVob8FMT6Rk,18759600,18765280,you know the legality of contraception  of  of gay rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,18765280,18771120,things like that that has shocked a  number of democrats up on capitol hill

UVob8FMT6Rk,18776798,18782000,pelosi as she was coming off the floor  let's hear exactly what she had to say
UVob8FMT6Rk,18782000,18787040,given the comments from justice thomas's  descent especially about other steps the
UVob8FMT6Rk,18787040,18792798,court might take  are there things you think the house can  do to get ahead of any of those
UVob8FMT6Rk,18792798,18799680,possibilities  for 30 years or more i have been telling  people  that the determination of pregnancy is
UVob8FMT6Rk,18799680,18806320,just the front game for this they're  after the  whole reproductive health issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,18806320,18812480,against  contraception family planning  and mutual fertilization
UVob8FMT6Rk,18812480,18818958,and they make no home to that they'll  say my assets will vote  against
UVob8FMT6Rk,18828770,18833920,[Music]  criminalize all of it
UVob8FMT6Rk,18833920,18840240,all of it  so this is  what we're doing but after you give  clearance to thomas
UVob8FMT6Rk,18840240,18848240,okay  he told  us and so you heard from speaker pelosi
UVob8FMT6Rk,18848240,18854958,there i caught up with her uh in her  press conference earlier today and asked  her specifically for uh millions of
UVob8FMT6Rk,18854958,18860320,americans uh who who woke up today now  feeling uh helpless that they they don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,18860320,18866958,know what to do after this supreme court  decision that they vehemently disagree  with what should folks be doing
UVob8FMT6Rk,18866958,18872480,speaker pelosi  talked about the day after donald trump  was
UVob8FMT6Rk,18872480,18878320,sworn in as president she said millions  of americans of women specifically took
UVob8FMT6Rk,18878320,18884240,to the streets in peaceful protest  she thought  you know something like that should
UVob8FMT6Rk,18884240,18889360,happen again 150 democrats did just that  walking across the street to the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,18889360,18895200,court and let their voices be heard  you know in protest against this supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,18895200,18900878,court decision  you know at the same time scott we we  did hear from two senators in some
UVob8FMT6Rk,18900878,18906798,pretty strong words who are now saying  that they felt like they were misled by  members of the supreme court can you
UVob8FMT6Rk,18906798,18912480,explain some of what we heard today from  them  yeah absolutely
UVob8FMT6Rk,18912480,18919840,senators as you know conduct the  confirmation hearings for supreme court  justices and if you'll recall
UVob8FMT6Rk,18919840,18926638,in  some of these hearings for brett  kavanaugh and neil gorsuch the questions
UVob8FMT6Rk,18926638,18931680,were asked specifically and repeatedly  is roe v wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,18931680,18937280,is  do you believe it is precedent  and the answer uh time and again was yes
UVob8FMT6Rk,18937280,18945120,that is that is uh  that is the precedent that is the the  law it was upheld in subsequent cases
UVob8FMT6Rk,18945120,18950320,those justices were under oath at that  time  during those confirmation hearings and
UVob8FMT6Rk,18950320,18956798,so this has  really upset and frustrated a number of  the senators who were some of those who
UVob8FMT6Rk,18956798,18962798,met with those justices during those  confirmation hearings who were some of  the individuals who specifically asked
UVob8FMT6Rk,18962798,18969760,those questions of those justices they  feel they have been misled  let's hear a little bit more from some
UVob8FMT6Rk,18969760,18976958,of those senators including senator  manchin and senator susan collins the  republican from maine
UVob8FMT6Rk,18976958,18982240,i think we actually have a graphic we  can put up on the screen that's showing  some of what we heard from senator
UVob8FMT6Rk,18982240,18988958,manchin here scott  okay let's hear from manchin mansion  says i trusted justice gorsuch and
UVob8FMT6Rk,18988958,18994400,justice kavanagh when they testified  under oath that they also believed roe v
UVob8FMT6Rk,18994400,19002080,wade was settled legal precedent and i  am alarmed they chose to reject the  stability the ruling has provided for
UVob8FMT6Rk,19002080,19009040,two generations of americans  susan collins says this decision is
UVob8FMT6Rk,19009040,19015840,inconsistent with what justices gorsuch  and kavanaugh said in their testimony  and their meetings with me
UVob8FMT6Rk,19015840,19022798,where they both were insistent on the  importance of supporting long-standing  precedents that the country has relied
UVob8FMT6Rk,19022798,19028400,upon  and so  you're hearing just a little bit of
UVob8FMT6Rk,19028400,19033520,frustration from those two senators uh  you know there are a number of others
UVob8FMT6Rk,19033520,19038638,who feel exactly the same way we will  probably be hearing from a wider group
UVob8FMT6Rk,19038638,19045600,of senators in the days to come  and scott i do want to ask while i have  you about this other breaking story  today the house passing that landmark
UVob8FMT6Rk,19045600,19051520,gun legislation that was approved by the  senate yesterday uh speaker pelosi a few  moments ago held a ceremony for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19051520,19057840,passage of that bill  walk us through this what happens next  here
UVob8FMT6Rk,19058240,19063600,well as you know this past the united  states senate last night
UVob8FMT6Rk,19063600,19069600,lawmakers were in a hurry to get that  passed in the house of representatives  today because lawmakers are now
UVob8FMT6Rk,19069600,19076878,departing on a two-week recess for the  july 4th holiday  and so what happens now is
UVob8FMT6Rk,19076878,19082560,it it goes to president biden's desk for  his signature the president has vowed to
UVob8FMT6Rk,19082560,19087600,sign it  this is the most significant gun
UVob8FMT6Rk,19087600,19093360,legislation in about three decades in a  generation some of the highlights very
UVob8FMT6Rk,19093360,19099360,quickly it expands child and family  mental health services strengthens  background checks for buyers under age
UVob8FMT6Rk,19099360,19105440,21 and closes the boyfriend loophole  among a number of other things now chris
UVob8FMT6Rk,19105440,19110718,murphy one of the chief  negotiators the democratic negotiator
UVob8FMT6Rk,19110718,19115920,told reporters that look this is this is  just the first step in what he hopes
UVob8FMT6Rk,19115920,19120958,will be additional  gun measures to prevent uh you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,19120958,19127040,events like uvalde texas and the mass  shootings in buffalo new york but
UVob8FMT6Rk,19127040,19134160,you know  the big question remains will  republicans continue to stay at the  table with democrats in negotiating
UVob8FMT6Rk,19134160,19140240,additional gun measures or do they feel  like this is enough especially since  they're feeling pressure from their
UVob8FMT6Rk,19140240,19145840,right flanks and gun rights groups like  the nra  all right scott wong for us on capitol
UVob8FMT6Rk,19145840,19153200,hill today scott we appreciate your  reporting on this thank you  i want to turn to nbc news correspondent  cal perry now he's in st louis missouri
UVob8FMT6Rk,19153200,19158560,for us today cal  we know that missouri is one of those 13  states with uh with a trigger law in
UVob8FMT6Rk,19158560,19164320,place i think we have a map we can put  up on the screen so folks can see all of  those states now abortion is going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,19164320,19171760,banned in these places now that roe is  overturned the attorney general there  missouri made that state's abortion ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,19171760,19177200,official a little while ago help us  understand that what is he saying
UVob8FMT6Rk,19177200,19183120,so yeah abortion became illegal here in  the state of missouri about 10 minutes  after that supreme court ruling today it
UVob8FMT6Rk,19183120,19189440,was made possible because the state  passed a law in 2019 as you put it this  trigger law which basically says once
UVob8FMT6Rk,19189440,19194718,the supreme court overturns roe v wade  if it should overturn roe v wade that  trigger law would immediately come into
UVob8FMT6Rk,19194718,19199920,effect the only thing that would prevent  it from going into effect is if the  governor or the attorney general or the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19199920,19207360,state legislator didn't make a  proclamation but as you sort of put out  the attorney general made that  proclamation he signed it making
UVob8FMT6Rk,19207360,19213280,abortion officially illegal in this  state it is now a class b felony to  provide somebody with an abortion that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19213280,19220638,is it is the medical provider who is  really targeted by the law five to 15  years in prison now the location where i
UVob8FMT6Rk,19220638,19226878,am is an important one because it is the  only location in the entire state of  missouri where it was possible to get an
UVob8FMT6Rk,19226878,19233360,abortion before this ruling it is the  planned parenthood here in saint louis  and this planned parenthood sent a
UVob8FMT6Rk,19233360,19238480,letter just shortly after the attorney  general signed that proclamation letting  the state health department know that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19238480,19244718,they were ceasing providing this  procedure it is the first time in 50  years that they have had to do so so for
UVob8FMT6Rk,19244718,19250240,women who are in this state who want to  get an abortion they're going to have to  go out of state illinois you can still
UVob8FMT6Rk,19250240,19256638,do that the governor there saying that  that right will be protected overhanging  all of this aaron is a very conservative
UVob8FMT6Rk,19256638,19262558,state legislature a conservative  governor a conservative attorney general  so you have i think a real fear amongst
UVob8FMT6Rk,19262558,19268320,women and amongst groups like planned  parenthood that this is just the first  step in many that will curtail freedoms
UVob8FMT6Rk,19268320,19273760,for women as they would put it things  like birth control they worry could be  next on the talking aaron
UVob8FMT6Rk,19273760,19281360,so cal is that it then for planned  parenthood in in missouri is there a  next step for them to try to help women
UVob8FMT6Rk,19281360,19287120,in missouri  so it's it's not it for planned  parenthood in missouri certainly planned
UVob8FMT6Rk,19287120,19292718,parenthood would say they're going to  continue to provide health care and  reproductive health care to women
UVob8FMT6Rk,19292718,19298558,in this state but it is increasingly  difficult they would say uh to do so  because you continue to have
UVob8FMT6Rk,19298558,19303920,restrictions put on the work that they  can do by the state's legislature and  again i'm saying it the way i'm saying
UVob8FMT6Rk,19303920,19308958,it because it's nothing new here in the  state of missouri right the trigger law  was in place three years before the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19308958,19315040,supreme court overturned roe v wade so  planned parenthood is constantly they  would say battling the state to provide
UVob8FMT6Rk,19315040,19320240,reproductive health care for women and  again that is what this is about they  would say nationally and they did so in
UVob8FMT6Rk,19320240,19326080,their sort of national statement they  said well they're not surprised it is  still very much shocking and i think
UVob8FMT6Rk,19326080,19332958,that's true for planned parenthood  across the country and certainly uh it's  true for women here in the state of  missouri  cal perry for us in st louis today cal
UVob8FMT6Rk,19332958,19338638,thank you we appreciate it  now as we focus on the u.s right now we  also want to turn some attention
UVob8FMT6Rk,19338638,19344000,overseas an american couple vacationing  in malta is now facing the unthinkable
UVob8FMT6Rk,19344000,19351120,andrea prudente seen here in a hospital  in malta is suffering a miscarriage  doctors say there is no way to save her
UVob8FMT6Rk,19351120,19356480,baby but she cannot get an abortion  because abortions are illegal in malta
UVob8FMT6Rk,19356480,19363600,continuing the pregnancy could kill her  today show reporter danielle  campo amore is following the story for
UVob8FMT6Rk,19363600,19369120,us and joining us now uh danielle this  woman was 16 weeks pregnant had a
UVob8FMT6Rk,19369120,19376240,healthy pregnancy up until she suffered  a miscarriage what are you hearing from  her what did she say happened
UVob8FMT6Rk,19376240,19382718,absolutely thank you so much for having  me so  as you said she was 16 weeks pregnant  this was a very wanted pregnancy her and
UVob8FMT6Rk,19382718,19388320,her partner jay were so thrilled to  learn that they were actually going to  have a baby girl they took a baby moon
UVob8FMT6Rk,19388320,19393440,to malta to just spend some quality time  together before their daughter was going  to come into the world and then in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19393440,19399760,middle of the night this sunday  she woke up to intense pain and her pool  of blood and realized that she
UVob8FMT6Rk,19399760,19406080,there was some type of medical emergency  happening they rushed to the nearest  hospital after two days of various
UVob8FMT6Rk,19406080,19411360,treatments and observations they were  told there was no way that the pregnancy  was viable that their baby girl was not
UVob8FMT6Rk,19411360,19416638,going to make it that she was slowly  dying and she was in the middle of  miscarrying but her body hadn't been
UVob8FMT6Rk,19416638,19423840,able to actually expel the pregnancy her  placenta had detached that she had no  amniotic fluid whatsoever this is not a
UVob8FMT6Rk,19423840,19429840,viable pregnancy but as you mentioned  because the laws in malta are some of  the most extreme in the world abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,19429840,19435040,is outlawed entirely for any reason you  have to be actively dying for a doctor
UVob8FMT6Rk,19435040,19441280,there to help you and assist you in that  way they were denied care and they were  told basically you can either stay here
UVob8FMT6Rk,19441280,19447760,hope that the pregnancy will pass  although they were told that was very  unlikely and they would have to risk
UVob8FMT6Rk,19447760,19454400,either her dying from sepsis a very  severe infection or bleeding out to  death or they could find a way to leave
UVob8FMT6Rk,19454400,19462160,the country which is what they did  last night i spoke to them again this  morning they are finally safe in spain
UVob8FMT6Rk,19462160,19468080,after taking an ambulatory flight  from multitude there and she's awaiting  her there
UVob8FMT6Rk,19468080,19473600,but this is uh one ob gyn and malta told  me that this is what is what americans
UVob8FMT6Rk,19473600,19480320,should expect to happen now that roe has  fallen  all right danielle campo more we
UVob8FMT6Rk,19480320,19486000,appreciate you bringing that story to  light obviously a very difficult  situation for that couple to have to
UVob8FMT6Rk,19486000,19492958,deal with and to have to go through  and as you indicated something that we  could see happening more uh as time goes
UVob8FMT6Rk,19492958,19499760,by here in the u.s uh we appreciate your  reporting on that danielle thank you  joining me now is bernardo villalona she
UVob8FMT6Rk,19499760,19506240,is a criminal defense attorney and a  former prosecutor uh bernard louisiana's  governor signed a bill this week that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19506240,19512160,could send abortion providers to jail  for up to 10 years  even if prosecutors failed to prove that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19512160,19519360,an abortion took place what are the  consequences for people who are  simply investigated
UVob8FMT6Rk,19519360,19524798,so this is going to be a huge problem  for louisiana as well as the other  states that have banned abortion because
UVob8FMT6Rk,19524798,19531520,now we're talking about prosecution  prosecutions that can lead to searching  of your phone searching of your of your
UVob8FMT6Rk,19531520,19538000,health records searching up doctors  we're talking about so many things that  can happen and pidgin on the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,19538000,19544558,through privacy which is exactly what  roe versus wade stood for
UVob8FMT6Rk,19544558,19552000,you know the dissenting justices wrote  that uh individual biases not the rule  of law have have taken over the court uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,19552000,19558240,what's your take on that assessment  if we're talking about individual biases  that have taken over the court but that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19558240,19563520,is exactly what this decision was  individual biases because they chose to
UVob8FMT6Rk,19563520,19569280,completely deny the precedent that was  set forth enrolled versus wade a case
UVob8FMT6Rk,19569280,19576400,that i was born into with having that  right so the judges have now become  politicized with this type of decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,19576400,19582480,that they rendered today that dealt a  huge blow to a woman's reproductive  rights and the right to choose you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,19582480,19588240,there's an attorney for the center for  reproductive rights who predicts that  legal chaos is going to happen in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19588240,19596000,aftermath of this decision what's your  take on that what sort of challenges do  do you think states face now
UVob8FMT6Rk,19596000,19601520,i call it it's going to be a legal civil  war amongst the states because all the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19601520,19608000,state every state is going to have a  different way of how they look at  abortions how they prosecute abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,19608000,19614240,what they allow in terms of abortions so  you're talking about people jumping from  state to safe depending on what the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19614240,19619440,desire is going to be the question would  be can one state tell me i can't do
UVob8FMT6Rk,19619440,19625360,something in another state and then come  back to my state where i actually live  so i think all of this is going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,19625360,19631760,litigated in the courts and we're going  to see all of this play out right before  our eyes today is not the last day it
UVob8FMT6Rk,19631760,19637680,seems on this topic at all bernardo  villalona we appreciate your time today  thank you  thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,19637680,19644080,let's bring in nbc news reporter julie  sirkin now for more on today's supreme  court ruling on abortion rights she's at
UVob8FMT6Rk,19644080,19649680,the capitol for us julie i know you  spoke to a mother and daughter who who  both had abortions decades apart
UVob8FMT6Rk,19649680,19655040,obviously one before row the other  during row what did they tell you about  their experiences
UVob8FMT6Rk,19655040,19662000,yeah erin i sat down with sami detzer  who had the unique experience of getting  to talk openly with her mom about their
UVob8FMT6Rk,19662000,19667120,abortion experiences but sammy told me  that if her mom were alive today she
UVob8FMT6Rk,19667120,19675200,could have never imagined a future  without roe  i was 19 or 20 when i had an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,19675200,19681760,and i was 25 when i had an abortion  patty detzer had an abortion five years  before the supreme court's landmark
UVob8FMT6Rk,19681760,19686878,ruling legally protecting a woman's  right to choose they told me to get an
UVob8FMT6Rk,19686878,19692480,abortion i had to see  to have a legal abortion i had to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,19692480,19699200,three shrinks  i do remember by the time i was finished  with that you know i felt like
UVob8FMT6Rk,19699200,19706320,i really am crazy  her daughter sammy found out she was  pregnant in 2015. a year later the two
UVob8FMT6Rk,19706320,19712320,of them interviewed each other on a  local radio show so  i went and i bought a pregnancy test
UVob8FMT6Rk,19712320,19718798,before work one morning and this one  came out positive the two women's  experiences could not have been any more
UVob8FMT6Rk,19718798,19725760,different 47 years apart it took them  a really long time so by the time they
UVob8FMT6Rk,19725760,19730798,got to me i was five months pregnant i  called
UVob8FMT6Rk,19730798,19737840,my best friend and  after i hung up the phone with her i  called planned parenthood and
UVob8FMT6Rk,19737840,19743440,immediately made an appointment for an  abortion how fast was that whole process  for you
UVob8FMT6Rk,19743440,19748878,like five minutes it was so fast patty  was dealing with substance abuse it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,19748878,19753920,her first time away from home she could  barely take care of herself she wondered
UVob8FMT6Rk,19753920,19759600,how could she raise a child  she would have had to make a lot of  sacrifices
UVob8FMT6Rk,19759600,19766320,at that point she hadn't finished school  after the abortion paddy got her life on  track receiving a master's degree in
UVob8FMT6Rk,19766320,19772718,ceramics becoming an artist and going on  to have three beautiful children it took  her five months and it took me five
UVob8FMT6Rk,19772718,19778798,minutes  and both of us  knew from  the moment we found out we were pregnant
UVob8FMT6Rk,19778798,19786240,that what we needed what we wanted to do  and i was just  born in a much luckier time having
UVob8FMT6Rk,19786240,19792638,access to a safe and effective abortion  process didn't make it emotionally  easier for sammy we've created this
UVob8FMT6Rk,19792638,19797680,shroud of shame this like  perception that it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,19797680,19804798,unacceptable patty's openness with her  daughter about her own abortion helped  sammy feel confident about her decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,19804798,19810320,she quickly started sharing her abortion  story with others i didn't believe that
UVob8FMT6Rk,19810320,19816400,one in three one in four people has  an abortion that did that seemed like a  way too high to me because i felt like
UVob8FMT6Rk,19816400,19823440,my mom was the only person i knew right  but at first sammy thought about keeping  it a secret i
UVob8FMT6Rk,19823440,19829040,just didn't feel  ready to tell you i remember i had a  thought in my mind like maybe i'll just
UVob8FMT6Rk,19829040,19835840,never tell her maybe i'll never tell  anyone i never told my parents they were  already having a hard enough time with
UVob8FMT6Rk,19835840,19843360,me patti tragically passed away in 2018.  what do you think your mom would say if
UVob8FMT6Rk,19843360,19851920,she was here today and  ro was being overturned she would be so  angry she would be so frustrated and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,19851920,19859200,defeated i know for a fact that she too  would have as i did think about my  two-year-old niece and how devastating
UVob8FMT6Rk,19859200,19864638,it is that she is growing up in a world  where  rights are actively being taken away
UVob8FMT6Rk,19864638,19871280,from people  erin this idea that women today in  america will have less rights than their
UVob8FMT6Rk,19871280,19877440,mothers did is one we've heard echoed  throughout these halls of congress all  day today from speaker pelosi to senator
UVob8FMT6Rk,19877440,19883600,sherrod brown who told me that he can  imagine a reality in which his daughter  and granddaughter have less rights than
UVob8FMT6Rk,19883600,19890000,his wife did  all right julie sirkin for us on capitol  hill today julie thank you  here with me in the studio nbc news
UVob8FMT6Rk,19890000,19895760,legal analyst danny cevallos and news  reporter chloe adkins and i want to give  you guys a final thought here as we wrap
UVob8FMT6Rk,19895760,19900798,up this hour of coverage chloe i'll  start with you the big takeaway what you  want uh folks who are listening to this
UVob8FMT6Rk,19900798,19905840,story to really sort of zero in on as we  head into into the weekend that's right
UVob8FMT6Rk,19905840,19913040,um aaron i really want viewers to take  away that abortion is now largely  inaccessible in half of this country and
UVob8FMT6Rk,19913040,19918558,that means that low-income women of  color located in large swaths of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19918558,19924320,south and midwest will have a very  difficult time accessing abortion out of
UVob8FMT6Rk,19924320,19930320,state so that will leave them with one  of two options they will be forced to  carry on one in pregnancy to term which
UVob8FMT6Rk,19930320,19935440,will put them in very precarious  situations as it relates to their health
UVob8FMT6Rk,19935440,19941840,their financial stability that will not  only affect them but the child that is  born out of that unwanted pregnancy the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19941840,19947040,children that they already have their  family and their community the other
UVob8FMT6Rk,19947040,19953600,option too is to self-manage their own  abortion and like we talked about at the  top of this hour self-managing one's
UVob8FMT6Rk,19953600,19960638,abortion looks very different than it  did in a pre-roe v wade world  we have seen an advancement in science
UVob8FMT6Rk,19960638,19966080,and in medication women we are seeing  them now not just since texas banned
UVob8FMT6Rk,19966080,19971920,abortion at six weeks um with sba back  in september 2021 but just you know over
UVob8FMT6Rk,19971920,19979040,the years self-managing their own  abortion using medication by buying it  online or getting it through trusted  community members danny
UVob8FMT6Rk,19979040,19984320,where does this go legally from here one  would think that once the supreme court  has said what it's said that that's the
UVob8FMT6Rk,19984320,19990400,end of the road but uh i would imagine  there are lawyers right now who are  looking at what what comes next the next
UVob8FMT6Rk,19990400,19995440,two fronts are essentially state laws  state constitutions to what degree do
UVob8FMT6Rk,19995440,20001680,state constitutions protect a right to  an abortion in each of the several  states and to what degree can states
UVob8FMT6Rk,20001680,20008000,outlaw extra territorial abortions  abortions  where residents travel out of state in
UVob8FMT6Rk,20008000,20014240,order to obtain an abortion those are  the next places this goes all right  we'll be watching that danny cevallos  chloe atkins we appreciate you both
UVob8FMT6Rk,20014240,20019840,being a part of our coverage these last  three hours and of course thank you for  being with us here on nbc news now i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,20019840,20027240,aaron gilchrist breaking news coverage  continues with chuck todd on meet the  press now
UVob8FMT6Rk,20033140,20044320,[Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,20044320,20051200,welcome to meet the press now i'm chuck  todd in washington on what is an  historic  day and a perilous moment in american
UVob8FMT6Rk,20051200,20057440,politics this is the scene right now  this is the steps of the u.s supreme  court as both
UVob8FMT6Rk,20057440,20064400,pro-choice  demonstrators and pro-life demonstrators  continue to gather after the court's
UVob8FMT6Rk,20064400,20070320,expected but still no less dramatic  ruling overturning 50 years of precedent
UVob8FMT6Rk,20070320,20076638,eliminating the constitutional right  to an abortion we heard the president  this afternoon urged demonstrations
UVob8FMT6Rk,20076638,20082638,across the country to remain peaceful  the ruling is one for the history books  and it sets in motion and avalanche of
UVob8FMT6Rk,20082638,20087920,legal medical political and cultural  fallout at a time
UVob8FMT6Rk,20087920,20093760,when you have to ask yourself if this  country can handle yet another divisive  issue 13 states with trigger laws on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20093760,20099120,books are going to be banning abortions  immediately or within a very short  period of time oklahoma's attorney
UVob8FMT6Rk,20099120,20105760,general for example announced this  afternoon  that his state will now prohibit  abortions on demand
UVob8FMT6Rk,20105760,20111680,in the coming weeks it's expected that  roughly half of the states in this  country will make the procedure illegal
UVob8FMT6Rk,20111680,20118240,even in instances of rape or incest not  in every one of those cases but in some  of them it's the first time ever that a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20118240,20123360,supreme court has granted a widely  recognized right and then
UVob8FMT6Rk,20123360,20128878,taken it away  what that means for other court  presidents  upholding the right to same-sex marriage
UVob8FMT6Rk,20128878,20134400,contraception use and beyond boy is that  a major question mark anything that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,20134400,20141520,tied to the so-called right to privacy  then there's the political follow-up  we're just months away from the midterms  clearly that's on the president's mind
UVob8FMT6Rk,20141520,20147360,as he looks to energize  his base and avoid losing control of  congress in november here with some of
UVob8FMT6Rk,20147360,20152558,his reaction this afternoon  this fall
UVob8FMT6Rk,20152558,20157920,we must elect more senators  representatives who will codify  the woman's right to choose in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20157920,20164798,federal law once again  elect more state leaders to protect this  right at the local level
UVob8FMT6Rk,20164798,20171760,this fall roe is on the ballot  personal freedoms are on the ballot
UVob8FMT6Rk,20171760,20177760,the right to privacy  liberty equality  they're all on the ballot
UVob8FMT6Rk,20177760,20183360,and moments ago vice president harris  addressed the ruling while traveling in  chicago echoing the president's comments
UVob8FMT6Rk,20183360,20189200,and urging supporters to use the ballot  box as a tool to combat the court's  ruling the bottom line actually though
UVob8FMT6Rk,20189200,20195280,is the supreme court said  that abortion rights now have to be  decided at the ballot box they didn't  say it that's explicitly but when you do
UVob8FMT6Rk,20195280,20201760,what you did  it now means it is an election issue all  the time not just this one i'm joined
UVob8FMT6Rk,20201760,20206878,now by my nbc news colleagues for  reaction here at the supreme court and  from states around the country facing
UVob8FMT6Rk,20206878,20213200,new restrictions justice correspondent  pete williams is here to give us the  legal breakdown julia ainslie's outside  of the supreme court kathy park in
UVob8FMT6Rk,20213200,20219600,jackson mississippi right near the  clinic that brought this case  dasha burns is in grand rapids michigan
UVob8FMT6Rk,20219600,20225440,and josh letterman is at the white house  pete let me start with you  and let's break down the rulings here
UVob8FMT6Rk,20225440,20231520,because you have alito's ruling you have  the thomas concurring  and and kavanaugh concurrings you have
UVob8FMT6Rk,20231520,20237520,roberts's  own version of this  and i guess what is operational and what
UVob8FMT6Rk,20237520,20243520,isn't i know what alito wrote is  operational but then kavanaugh wrote  something about
UVob8FMT6Rk,20243520,20250160,what this does and how operational is  that so just i'd like to break down each  one of these concurring opinions not
UVob8FMT6Rk,20250160,20256240,just toledo but start with alito okay  remember how this case came to the  supreme court it was a challenge based
UVob8FMT6Rk,20256240,20262798,on mississippi's law that would ban  abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy so  the court granted the case limited to
UVob8FMT6Rk,20262798,20269360,one question  can states ban abortion before the age  of fetal viability that was the question
UVob8FMT6Rk,20269360,20275920,before the court and the court today  said the answer to that is yes that vote  was six to three with chief justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,20275920,20281920,roberts joining with the other  conservatives on the question of  overturning roe versus wade the vote was
UVob8FMT6Rk,20281920,20288480,five to four robert said we don't need  to go that far to answer that question  about viability now of course
UVob8FMT6Rk,20288480,20295200,once you take away the viability  benchmark say the courts can ban  abortion before the age of viability
UVob8FMT6Rk,20295200,20301920,then you're on a sliding scale that  eventually gets rid of roe v wade anyway  but but he said the court went too fast
UVob8FMT6Rk,20301920,20309440,in in overturning roe now so those are  the two holdings the mississippi law is  upheld roe and all the follow-on cases
UVob8FMT6Rk,20309440,20316400,over 50 years sustaining the abortion  right are now overturned  justice brett kavanaugh in a concurring
UVob8FMT6Rk,20316400,20321920,opinion now  normally speaking a concurrence would be  just his own opinion but because the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20321920,20328080,rogue case is five to four if he had  peeled away  that would only be four it wouldn't be a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20328080,20336400,majority so what he says in his  concurrence is controlling he says in  his view a state cannot ban someone in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20336400,20342480,state that where abortion becomes  illegal can't ban that person or make it  a crime for them to go to a state where
UVob8FMT6Rk,20342480,20347600,abortion is legal in order to get the  procedure so that is also a holding of
UVob8FMT6Rk,20347600,20354080,the supreme court today  now the the other question that you got  to get gets to what the court said about
UVob8FMT6Rk,20354080,20360558,why it's ruling this way justice alito  wrote the draft opinion  that leaked in february this opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,20360558,20367360,today tracks it very closely he says you  can't find the right to abortion in the  constitution and so to find out whether
UVob8FMT6Rk,20367360,20373840,it's a substantive due process right  from the 14th amendment the test is is  it something that is deeply rooted in
UVob8FMT6Rk,20373840,20380240,the nation's history and traditions and  is essential to a concept of ordered  liberty and that by that test he says
UVob8FMT6Rk,20380240,20385280,roe flunks the test because  roe abortion was illegal at the time of
UVob8FMT6Rk,20385280,20391040,the founding and at the time the 14th  amendment was adopted in most of the  states
UVob8FMT6Rk,20391040,20398480,so he says abortion is different  abortion is the reason the the ruling he  says twice the ruling is only about the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20398480,20404638,abortion right and not about other  precedents like interracial marriage  same-sex marriage the right to receive
UVob8FMT6Rk,20404638,20410958,refuse medical treatment the right to  choose how your children get educated  and so forth he said none of those are
UVob8FMT6Rk,20410958,20417200,at risk here this this decision he says  doesn't invite involve them at all  because abortion is different there's a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20417200,20423680,moral aspect to it because there's a  potential life involved and that's why  abortion is different justice clarence
UVob8FMT6Rk,20423680,20428718,thomas says mel maybe we should look at  those other decisions that derive from
UVob8FMT6Rk,20428718,20434958,that 14th amendment analysis and that  so-called right to privacy including  contraceptives same-sex marriage
UVob8FMT6Rk,20434958,20440160,innovate sexual relations and so forth i  would point out that
UVob8FMT6Rk,20440160,20446878,it certainly does the logic of the of  alito's ruling and what he says about it  are to some extent intention and this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,20446878,20452878,what the the dissent says it says this  is hypocritical to say well here's the  test is it deeply rooted in the history
UVob8FMT6Rk,20452878,20458080,but on the other hand don't worry about  these because we promise we won't touch  them
UVob8FMT6Rk,20458080,20464160,the dissenters say you know that's you  can't have it both ways i will say about  same-sex marriage there is one
UVob8FMT6Rk,20464160,20472000,difference in that ruling because you  can also read the same-sex marriage  ruling as saying that it's based on  equal protection that a man can marry uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,20472000,20478558,uh uh could you know until the decision  was made a man could marry a woman but  not a man and the supreme court said  that's that's part of the problem with
UVob8FMT6Rk,20478558,20486080,the laws against same-sex marriage all  right i got one quick follow-up and i  know we have a lot of folks but which is  this pete you talked about you said
UVob8FMT6Rk,20486080,20493040,brett kavanaugh's concurring opinion was  controlling it has to do with going out  of state to get uh an abortion procedure
UVob8FMT6Rk,20493040,20498400,does does that protection apply to the  medical personnel that give that advice
UVob8FMT6Rk,20498400,20504240,to that person that decides to cross  state lines if they're practicing  medicine in a state that bans abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,20504240,20510400,yeah unclear i think and of course this  is what attorney general merrick garland  said today in his statement that not
UVob8FMT6Rk,20510400,20516240,only should the right to travel be  recognized but this right to give advice  and advice patients should also be
UVob8FMT6Rk,20516240,20522400,recognized  joy ainsley um i guess now the question  is what is it
UVob8FMT6Rk,20522400,20528798,you're outside there you're hearing this  what are you hearing left and right on
UVob8FMT6Rk,20528798,20534638,this how celebratory on the right is  this uh the end or the or the end of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20534638,20542878,beginning for the pro-life movement and  what kind of  uh what kind of actions are folks on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20542878,20548080,abortion right side of the aisle asking  for going forward
UVob8FMT6Rk,20550558,20555920,chuck it's  a little hard to hear you out here but  i'm going to tell you what i'm hearing  from the people on the ground here i
UVob8FMT6Rk,20555920,20562718,mean if you need to see how divisive  this issue and this decision is in this  country look no farther than the crowd
UVob8FMT6Rk,20562718,20568878,i'm standing in we just saw a pro-life  demonstrator of an anti-abortion  demonstrator jumped the fence here he
UVob8FMT6Rk,20568878,20575920,was escorted out by police and booed by  the crowd you had people to my left with  pictures of babies saying don't tread on
UVob8FMT6Rk,20575920,20583280,me you have people here obviously  leading uh  anti-pro-abortion access rallies very
UVob8FMT6Rk,20583280,20589680,upset about the decision today we've  seen people square off in each other's  faces we've seen more security come the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20589680,20596080,crowd gets thicker and it's expected to  continue like this overnight because of  this opinion as more and more people get
UVob8FMT6Rk,20596080,20601280,the news of it and come in to uh into  this rally here we've got people coming
UVob8FMT6Rk,20601280,20608798,through it's it's quite busy here i do  want you to listen to some of the things  that people told me today and we first
UVob8FMT6Rk,20608798,20615040,heard from people who were very upset  about this decision let's first hear  from those people who are pro-abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,20615040,20618716,access here's what they had to say
UVob8FMT6Rk,20620480,20626558,i was in the middle of praying when we  found out the decision was made  and i am
UVob8FMT6Rk,20626558,20632798,i'm overjoyed now i  i there's honestly no words that can  describe the way that i feel right now
UVob8FMT6Rk,20632798,20638480,um i've been waiting for this for a long  time and i know other people have been  waiting for this longer than i have i'm  excited
UVob8FMT6Rk,20638480,20644558,but we all as if you can you can see the  celebration but we all know this is not  where the work ends this is where it
UVob8FMT6Rk,20644558,20650080,begins because from  anyone you can ask this is what we'll be  working for for the rest of our lives to
UVob8FMT6Rk,20650080,20655442,make abortion illegal unthinkable and  unnecessary
UVob8FMT6Rk,20656480,20662320,so for example for me personally i'm  adopted  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,20662320,20666240,so knowing other mothers out there
UVob8FMT6Rk,20670958,20679400,it's pretty hard to see like i was lucky  and i have a wonderful mother
UVob8FMT6Rk,20682400,20689520,it feels like a betrayal it feels like  my country doesn't love me  and appreciate my body as a woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,20689520,20697920,to see us going back to knitting needles  and the whole thing i just i'm i'm  stunned i don't i don't understand
UVob8FMT6Rk,20697920,20704000,[Music]  so and actually chuck i should add that  the leader of this rally over here just
UVob8FMT6Rk,20704000,20709680,now  said that she wants to lead the pro  abortion access group to justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,20709680,20716320,thomas's house they also started  chanting right now about jenny thomas  the wife of justice thomas calling her
UVob8FMT6Rk,20716320,20722160,an insurrectionist obviously because of  some of the details that have recently  come out during the january six hearings
UVob8FMT6Rk,20722160,20728958,about her role and the election now she  wants to lead a crowd to the justice's  house this of course is the very reason
UVob8FMT6Rk,20728958,20735360,why there is increased security not only  here but at justice's residences of  course following what we know to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,20735360,20742160,someone who wanted to threaten brett  kavanaugh justice kavanaugh just a few  days ago so the mood here is high we'll
UVob8FMT6Rk,20742160,20748718,we'll see if these people do leave here  now and in fact go to justice thomas's  house but it's not unthinkable to think  that a lot of people here would have the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20748718,20754000,addresses of justices and want to bring  this issue directly to their doorsteps
UVob8FMT6Rk,20754000,20759680,hopefully in a peaceful protest but you  know it's something we have to watch  especially as this crowd grows more
UVob8FMT6Rk,20759680,20765120,tense with so much emotion on the line  it's a terrible look for the supreme  court that they refuse to
UVob8FMT6Rk,20765120,20770240,um go in person to present these to  present these cases here i think it only
UVob8FMT6Rk,20770240,20776000,adds to um adds to the frustration adds  to the idea that it's it's uh nobody
UVob8FMT6Rk,20776000,20782160,knows quite what's going on julie ansali  in front of the supreme court i want to  go to a couple of states with some  immediate fallout before we get to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20782160,20790400,white house let's go down to mississippi  that's where we have kathy park standing  by it was this  clinic that brought this case
UVob8FMT6Rk,20790400,20798558,what's the future of this clinic uh and  if where do  where do women who need uh access uh to
UVob8FMT6Rk,20798558,20804080,abortion go now  so chuck we are actually just a few
UVob8FMT6Rk,20804080,20809440,miles from that clinic and as you  mentioned this is the last remaining  clinic here in the state of mississippi
UVob8FMT6Rk,20809440,20815680,and leading up to this point the state  has been very restrictive when it comes  to abortion rights so because this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20815680,20821120,trigger loss state here in the state of  mississippi there is a 10-day window  essentially the attorney general will
UVob8FMT6Rk,20821120,20827200,need to certify  this decision that came down by the  supreme court and lynn finchy who
UVob8FMT6Rk,20827200,20832558,tweeted out earlier today shortly after  that decision came out she called this a  victory so following that rhetoric it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,20832558,20838558,likely that it will be official any day  now but going back to that clinic um  right now we shouldn't be hearing
UVob8FMT6Rk,20838558,20845840,momentarily from organizers with that  clinic and we spoke with them uh shortly  after that leak came out in may and they
UVob8FMT6Rk,20845840,20852718,said they were disappointed that the  supreme court even took this case so we  can understandably uh hear the the  disappointment the anger but they also
UVob8FMT6Rk,20852718,20858798,said that they're not surprised uh that  this announcement would be handed down  today but looking ahead what happens
UVob8FMT6Rk,20858798,20864000,next because i mentioned this is a  trigger loss state and after that 10 day  window  comes to an end that clinic will
UVob8FMT6Rk,20864000,20870558,ultimately close and they have working  behind the scenes to open up another  clinic this one in new mexico but also
UVob8FMT6Rk,20870558,20876000,they've been trying to get supporters  raise  money to help these women receive
UVob8FMT6Rk,20876000,20883360,abortions legally and safely but but  chuck it's going to be hours away the  closest clinic being in illinois so the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20883360,20888558,drive time will be anywhere between  seven hours to 22 hours and of course  you know you've been hearing the
UVob8FMT6Rk,20888558,20893600,headlines that this will  disproportionately impact women of color  poor women who don't necessarily have
UVob8FMT6Rk,20893600,20899200,the resources  and and the time to take off from work  to to access
UVob8FMT6Rk,20899200,20904558,these services so that is a big question  looking ahead beyond that 10-day window
UVob8FMT6Rk,20904558,20910558,i also asked folks here on the ground  how will they enforce this and that also  is a big question how will they
UVob8FMT6Rk,20910558,20915600,prosecute this if if people do happen to  get these abortions kind of underground
UVob8FMT6Rk,20915600,20921200,chuck kathy park in mississippi and as  she pointed out we're about to hear a  little more detail on what's the future
UVob8FMT6Rk,20921200,20927360,of that clinic uh in mississippi and uh  we may get back to you on that kathy  let's go to michigan michigan is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,20927360,20932878,another place where politically this  could become  ground zero they have a law on the books
UVob8FMT6Rk,20932878,20939440,that bans abortion immediately uh total  ban on abortion that goes back to 1931  there is an injunction against it so it
UVob8FMT6Rk,20939440,20946798,is unclear what happens next  dasha you've been there all day talking  with folks um do you have a better idea
UVob8FMT6Rk,20946798,20953840,of what is next in michigan and what it  you know  in three weeks if someone's look uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,20953840,20961040,needs  access to  abortion  what's gonna happen
UVob8FMT6Rk,20961040,20968798,so chuck there are still a lot of  questions the governor has filed a  lawsuit to invalidate that 1931 law that
UVob8FMT6Rk,20968798,20976320,bans abortion with no exceptions the  state's republican legislature though  has filed to defend
UVob8FMT6Rk,20976320,20982798,that law so they are uh for this  anti-abortion  1931 law
UVob8FMT6Rk,20982798,20989280,what happens next we're we don't know  exactly the timeline for how long this  injection will last right now abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,20989280,20996000,is still legal providers can continue to  do what they've been doing how long can  they do that that's the question mark
UVob8FMT6Rk,20996000,21001680,the governor just today did ask the  court to expedite this case so hopefully
UVob8FMT6Rk,21001680,21008400,we will get an answer soon but as i was  speaking with attorney general dana  nessel today she held a press briefing
UVob8FMT6Rk,21008400,21014240,she was talking about how we saw today  that court rulings that people expect to
UVob8FMT6Rk,21014240,21021440,last don't necessarily last they can be  overturned so what folks are looking  towards now is this ballot proposal for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21021440,21028718,november uh aborts and rights groups are  working to get enough signatures they  need over just about 425 000 signatures
UVob8FMT6Rk,21028718,21035200,by july 11 to get  that ballot  proposal in place for november that
UVob8FMT6Rk,21035200,21042000,would enshrine abortion rights in  michigan state constitution so  leadership right now that is working to
UVob8FMT6Rk,21042000,21047600,protect abortion rights say that's  actually probably the best and most  powerful avenue to make sure that
UVob8FMT6Rk,21047600,21053920,abortion rights are protected beyond uh  this administration because of course  we've got an election coming up in
UVob8FMT6Rk,21053920,21059840,november this is absolutely going to be  front and center but then there's an  election after that an election after  that and
UVob8FMT6Rk,21059840,21066558,who knows who will be in power then so  the goal for this administration right  now for the governor for the ag is to
UVob8FMT6Rk,21066558,21071680,put protections in place that will  outlast their tenure chuck and then
UVob8FMT6Rk,21071680,21078400,there's this what can you tell me about  this referendum that's on the ballot is  that definitely going to be on the  ballot in november or not
UVob8FMT6Rk,21079040,21085440,well that's that's what we're waiting to  find out chuck this is uh the next few  weeks are going to be critical for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21085440,21091840,people sort of battling on both sides of  this issue this is what's complicated  right this happens in washington and
UVob8FMT6Rk,21091840,21097920,then there's a trickle effect for states  and voters in these states who are  really unsure what's going to happen
UVob8FMT6Rk,21097920,21105600,next i had a woman walk up to me  virginia de haan she came up to me in  tears she was 18 years old when roe fell
UVob8FMT6Rk,21105600,21112558,and she's trying to grapple with the  decision in d.c and what it's going to  mean for her in this state which is
UVob8FMT6Rk,21112558,21118798,really still unclear uh the the  leadership here both the governor and  their attorney general say the situation
UVob8FMT6Rk,21118798,21124400,is dire but still hopeful but that's not  a clear-cut answer here chuck dr burns
UVob8FMT6Rk,21124400,21130240,in michigan where i promise you folks uh  abortion the issue of abortion will be
UVob8FMT6Rk,21130240,21137920,front and center in that governor's race  because of all of this  uncertainty of the state law um
UVob8FMT6Rk,21137920,21143360,uh dasha burns thank you now let's go to  the white house  josh letterman president biden came out
UVob8FMT6Rk,21143360,21149200,he made in many ways uh try to use this  as a little bit of a rallying cry for  the midterms basically saying look
UVob8FMT6Rk,21149200,21155280,there's limitations on what can get done  you're going to need to elect more  uh more senators more members of
UVob8FMT6Rk,21155280,21161040,congress who support a right to abortion  access so
UVob8FMT6Rk,21161040,21166080,there's been some talk of declaring a  public health emergency  that's about the one
UVob8FMT6Rk,21166080,21172000,it seems concrete thing this  administration could do can you explain  what the thinking is and and what
UVob8FMT6Rk,21172000,21178558,whether they're going to pursue this  well that is an idea chuck that has  mostly come from uh progressive groups
UVob8FMT6Rk,21178558,21185120,and some democratic lawmakers not one  that we have heard at all  being floated by members of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,21185120,21191200,administration but uh the basic idea  would be that you're gonna have a  handful of states that obviously are
UVob8FMT6Rk,21191200,21198240,gonna become safe havens for abortion uh  where if you're someone in a state that  is not gonna have legal abortion anymore
UVob8FMT6Rk,21198240,21204000,you're going to have all those people  flocking and potentially overwhelming  the health care systems and the limited
UVob8FMT6Rk,21204000,21210638,abortion clinics that exist in states  where abortion will continue to remain  legal so the idea is that one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,21210638,21216080,things that declaring a national public  health emergency could do would allow  the federal government to direct more
UVob8FMT6Rk,21216080,21221920,resources to places that are going to  bear the brunt of all of those people  seeking abortions going to those
UVob8FMT6Rk,21221920,21228080,specific states but really the idea is  that we have heard the white house  talking about and saying are the most
UVob8FMT6Rk,21228080,21236160,fruitful ways for them to move forward  on this issue have to do more with  protecting and enforcing existing laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,21236160,21242798,making sure that uh the justice  department for example is not allowing  people to infringe on the ability for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21242798,21249600,someone to go from one state to another  uh of of their own free will to uh to  seek an abortion uh likewise making sure
UVob8FMT6Rk,21249600,21256240,that uh states cannot simply decide to  throw out the science of the fda  which has determined that certain uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,21256240,21261600,medical abortion pills are both safe and  uh effective and so the president trying
UVob8FMT6Rk,21261600,21268160,to focus attention in his remarks uh  today on what his administration can and  will do while acknowledging that it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,21268160,21273600,very limited just like we've talked on  gun control and everything else about  how there's so little the president can
UVob8FMT6Rk,21273600,21279520,do without congress that is the case  here as well president biden being very  open about the fact that he cannot sign
UVob8FMT6Rk,21279520,21286400,some executive order and simply restore  a right that the supreme court took away  today and that is why the president
UVob8FMT6Rk,21286400,21292400,making this explicit political call to  action telling people if you want this  to change today does not have to be the
UVob8FMT6Rk,21292400,21298798,final decision but you have to go and  vote for lawmakers who are going to vote  themselves to restore rights for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21298798,21304638,abortion across the country yeah no i  think we are headed for what's been  a growing
UVob8FMT6Rk,21304638,21311040,sort of in some ways  new tradition here the more divided we  are the higher election turnout can get
UVob8FMT6Rk,21311040,21317600,uh and we may be headed for something  like that with these midterms josh  letterman at the white house thank you  before that pete williams joy ainsley
UVob8FMT6Rk,21317600,21324400,kathy park and dasha burns helping us  get all aspects of this story coming up  some democratic democratic-led states
UVob8FMT6Rk,21324400,21330400,prepare for a post-row reality the  governor of illinois is surrounded by a  lot of states  that don't uh that are going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,21330400,21335760,banning abortion how are they preparing  for that and then i'll be speaking with  michigan's attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,21335760,21341280,as we go deeper into the discussion i  had with dasha burns about what is the  future of abortion access in the state  of michigan
UVob8FMT6Rk,21341280,21347200,where right now it could end up being  complete a total and complete ban we'll  have much more on the fallout from
UVob8FMT6Rk,21347200,21352558,today's groundbreaking supreme court  decision what happens next where are we  headed as a country you're watching meet

UVob8FMT6Rk,21553680,21559440,their states with what kinds of  restrictions and whether to enforce laws  on the books ruling could shake up races
UVob8FMT6Rk,21559440,21564558,for governor attorneys general and other  statewide and local offices this  november and while some states are
UVob8FMT6Rk,21564558,21569760,expected to enact more restrictions  there are states that currently protect  abortion rights and they are now
UVob8FMT6Rk,21569760,21576480,preparing for an influx of out-of-state  residents seeking abortions joined now  by two democratic officials that are
UVob8FMT6Rk,21576480,21581680,trying to protect abortion rights in  their states one is the governor of  illinois jb pritzker who has already
UVob8FMT6Rk,21581680,21587280,announced a plan to call a special  legislative session in order to  strengthen  the state's abortion protections and
UVob8FMT6Rk,21587280,21593680,i'll be speaking with after the governor  michigan's attorney general daniel  nassel  who says she will not enforce the 1931
UVob8FMT6Rk,21593680,21599920,michigan ban the question is what  happens if others decide to do it we'll  get a lot more
UVob8FMT6Rk,21599920,21605360,hopefully answers to those questions as  well but let me start with you governor  pritzker let's start with
UVob8FMT6Rk,21605360,21612080,um what it is that you believe the state  of illinois needs to do to add  protections is this about enshrining it
UVob8FMT6Rk,21612080,21617520,in the state constitution what is it  that you're seeking the legislature to  do
UVob8FMT6Rk,21617520,21624000,so the first thing i can tell you is  that we got rid of our trigger laws a  few years ago we have terrific women
UVob8FMT6Rk,21624000,21630000,legislators in illinois who led the  fight  and i've been their ally in that we also
UVob8FMT6Rk,21630000,21635200,passed the reproductive health act back  in 2019 when i first became governor
UVob8FMT6Rk,21635200,21642878,we have more that we need to do  first of all we have enshrined into  law in illinois that women have their
UVob8FMT6Rk,21642878,21651280,reproductive rights guaranteed but  we're seeing tens of thousands  potentially of women coming from states
UVob8FMT6Rk,21651280,21658400,all around us  nearly everyone has a trigger law and  today it's illegal in their states so we
UVob8FMT6Rk,21658400,21665680,expect that more than the ten thousand  we saw last year coming from states  around us and all the way uh to texas
UVob8FMT6Rk,21665680,21672558,uh  we will see twenty thousand or  potentially thirty thousand because  people do need to exercise those rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,21672558,21680160,so we're going to need to expand  capacity in our state we're going to  need to make sure that we have the  health care personnel that are necessary
UVob8FMT6Rk,21680160,21687200,to perform these procedures and to  guarantee that medical abortion is  available yeah i want to put up a you
UVob8FMT6Rk,21687200,21693040,talked about the different um out of  states you guys have tracked this by  state uh and this is in 2020 it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,21693040,21698400,missouri where you had the most people  going across state lines um and you only
UVob8FMT6Rk,21698400,21704958,had a trickle from wisconsin and  michigan  obviously those are two places where we  could have trigger laws so you're at 20
UVob8FMT6Rk,21704958,21711360,000 out  what's your expectation double or triple  that you have to prepare for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21711360,21719680,well we're going to prepare for as many  as we need to um and again capacity  means personnel and it means space
UVob8FMT6Rk,21719680,21725200,we have more than 90 clinics across the  state some are right on the borders
UVob8FMT6Rk,21725200,21730718,and prepared to take the influx  some need more capacity chicago of
UVob8FMT6Rk,21730718,21735840,course butts up against indiana where  they're about to pass laws to uh make
UVob8FMT6Rk,21735840,21741760,abortion illegal entirely uh so  uh you know we have a lot to do here um
UVob8FMT6Rk,21741760,21747440,to make sure that we're  protecting the women in our state but  we've done a lot in that regard but now
UVob8FMT6Rk,21747440,21752878,it's about making sure that we're  protecting rights for people all over  the country  there may be some people that come into
UVob8FMT6Rk,21752878,21761280,the state that uh need access  to uh  to abortion but can't afford it
UVob8FMT6Rk,21761280,21766480,can you afford to pay for this as a  state  there are private organizations and
UVob8FMT6Rk,21766480,21773120,foundations that have helped to people  do that we've been supporting the  logistics operations for people coming
UVob8FMT6Rk,21773120,21778558,from out of state so they can find a  place to stay they can get a meal if  they need one
UVob8FMT6Rk,21778558,21784798,and get the support that they need to  get the procedure that they want but  we're not looking to pay for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21784798,21791840,out out-of-state people coming to  illinois to exercise those rights but we  are looking to support the organizations
UVob8FMT6Rk,21791840,21797200,that are providing those uh you know  supports and that includes especially
UVob8FMT6Rk,21797200,21803520,the providers themselves take a step  back look you're somebody that you're  running for reelection you you know you
UVob8FMT6Rk,21803520,21809120,you you're a state leader pretty large  state  who knows maybe you decide to run for
UVob8FMT6Rk,21809120,21814400,for something higher than that and i  asked the question this way this country  we're pretty divided right now we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,21814400,21820878,been divided for a while but we're  if it's possible to somehow get more  divided get more polarized
UVob8FMT6Rk,21820878,21826400,and i fear more pugilistic  how do you turn down the temperature
UVob8FMT6Rk,21826400,21833600,when it it looks like there's there's no  end to this divisiveness particularly  when you have a very activist aggressive
UVob8FMT6Rk,21833600,21839600,uh conservative movement this days that  feels very empowered  well it seems reasonable to me to
UVob8FMT6Rk,21839600,21845120,continue doing what we've always been  doing in illinois protecting women
UVob8FMT6Rk,21845120,21851920,there isn't a lot of change that will  occur in illinois for people who live in  illinois because we've protected a
UVob8FMT6Rk,21851920,21858718,woman's right to choose  the change will be that there are people  who need to uh you know exercise their
UVob8FMT6Rk,21858718,21865840,rights who are going to come to illinois  and try to do that so is that a you know  an attack on some other state no
UVob8FMT6Rk,21865840,21872958,that is simply standing up for what i  think are fundamental rights that uh you  know that are reasonable for us to fight
UVob8FMT6Rk,21872958,21878240,for  i guess address though you know  what kind of concern do you have about
UVob8FMT6Rk,21878240,21885840,where the country is right now  i am very concerned that we now have an  extremist supreme court that seems on
UVob8FMT6Rk,21885840,21892240,the verge of doing much worse than what  they've done which seems awful already
UVob8FMT6Rk,21892240,21897760,so going after the broad set of rights  that are protected by right to privacy
UVob8FMT6Rk,21897760,21904080,imagine if we went back to a day when in  order to get birth control you a woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,21904080,21910000,would have to ask her husband for  permission  or imagine if a young woman who's got a
UVob8FMT6Rk,21910000,21916240,career  would like to get birth control but  can't because it's outlawed in her state
UVob8FMT6Rk,21916240,21923440,so these are  you know i cannot imagine i'm 57 years  old i could not imagine that we would
UVob8FMT6Rk,21923440,21929600,see rights contracting in our country  and not expanding  so i i'm deeply concerned and i do think
UVob8FMT6Rk,21929600,21934958,that as you point out i like the word  pugilistic i do think that we're going
UVob8FMT6Rk,21934958,21940798,to start to see a you know an even  greater  agitation between states especially when
UVob8FMT6Rk,21940798,21947680,states like missouri are trying to pass  a law that would make it literally a  criminal offense to assist somebody from
UVob8FMT6Rk,21947680,21954480,missouri who might want to come to  illinois to exercise her rights governor  jb pritzker  i appreciate you coming on sharing your
UVob8FMT6Rk,21954480,21959760,uh sharing your views on this uh on this  highly charged day thank you thank you
UVob8FMT6Rk,21959760,21964798,all right let me go to somebody who's  got quite a hornet's nest on her hands
UVob8FMT6Rk,21964798,21970320,the attorney general of michigan  uh you've said we've talked about this  before you said look you are not going
UVob8FMT6Rk,21970320,21975520,to uh enforce this 1931 ban but you've  also made clear that
UVob8FMT6Rk,21975520,21980718,um you can't you know prosecutors below  you could  so
UVob8FMT6Rk,21980718,21987360,what happens next and what what  in in that  respect and
UVob8FMT6Rk,21987360,21993120,what can you do to ins to protect uh  the ability of women to get access to
UVob8FMT6Rk,21993120,21999600,abortion in michigan  well  thanks for having me um firstly uh right
UVob8FMT6Rk,21999600,22006000,now our very draconian 1931 law that  does not allow for exceptions for rape
UVob8FMT6Rk,22006000,22011200,no exceptions for uh incest no  exceptions uh for emergency medical
UVob8FMT6Rk,22011200,22017440,procedures no exception for the health  of the mother um the only very vague
UVob8FMT6Rk,22017440,22022958,exception is to save the life of the  mother and you know i think for a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,22022958,22029120,doctors they're not going to be entirely  certain what that means because there's  a lot of times where this procedure is
UVob8FMT6Rk,22029120,22036080,work required and there might not be a  hundred percent chance that a woman will  die but maybe there's a 50 chance or a
UVob8FMT6Rk,22036080,22042958,70 chance is that enough to not get  prosecuted there's really no way to know  so for me personally i've said that you
UVob8FMT6Rk,22042958,22050160,know as the top law enforcement official  in this state i will not enforce the law  in addition to that i represent our
UVob8FMT6Rk,22050160,22055600,licensing and regulatory agency with the  state  and we're the ones who are in charge of
UVob8FMT6Rk,22055600,22063360,bringing complaints uh and  you know defending and representing the  board of medicine uh you know nursing
UVob8FMT6Rk,22063360,22068958,boards all the medical providers and i  said  i will not allow the staff from my
UVob8FMT6Rk,22068958,22075600,office to participate in measures to  discipline health care providers
UVob8FMT6Rk,22075600,22082400,from a licensing perspective  because they are performing what  yesterday were totally legal procedures
UVob8FMT6Rk,22082400,22088240,in our state  um so that's that's what i can do i am  really you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,22088240,22094798,i i followed amicus brief on behalf of  the governor before the michigan supreme  court in support of her argument
UVob8FMT6Rk,22094798,22101120,and you know i'm encouraging people to  vote uh in november and to make sure  that not only are they supporting
UVob8FMT6Rk,22101120,22106718,pro-choice candidates all the way up and  down the ballot but that they are  supporting the reproductive freedom for
UVob8FMT6Rk,22106718,22111760,all bowel proposal that would codify  what were fundamental rights for us
UVob8FMT6Rk,22111760,22118160,under the u.s constitution into the  michigan constitution  uh but let me ask you if a prosecutor
UVob8FMT6Rk,22118160,22127760,below you  on a local prosecutor chooses to enforce  the 1931 law what can you do about that
UVob8FMT6Rk,22127760,22132798,i don't feel as though i have the  authority to tell a duly elected
UVob8FMT6Rk,22132798,22139200,prosecutor  from any county in the state what they  can and cannot charge only a court can
UVob8FMT6Rk,22139200,22145600,do that and again right now we have a  preliminary injunction that i believe  applies not just to me and my office but
UVob8FMT6Rk,22145600,22151200,to all prosecutors in this state but  later in the event that for instance uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,22151200,22158400,the governor's case fails or the planned  parenthood case fails  i mean the the only thing i can say is
UVob8FMT6Rk,22158400,22164638,that at least in the counties  uh where we have  democrats uh who are prosecutors who
UVob8FMT6Rk,22164638,22171520,have pledged also not to enforce the law  and then of course i won't be enforcing  the law that at least that's some
UVob8FMT6Rk,22171520,22177680,measure of security but since there's a  six-year statute of limitations and we  have term limits in our state you know i
UVob8FMT6Rk,22177680,22185040,can't say that that is going to  present the the kind of protection that  i would want if i was either a
UVob8FMT6Rk,22185040,22191760,a you know a physician or a medical  provider or if i was a woman seeking an  abortion tell me more about the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22191760,22198638,referendum is there is it definitely  going to be on the ballot and this would  enshrine it in the constitution and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,22198638,22205280,guess is there could it  could a legislate could a republican  governor republican legislature somehow
UVob8FMT6Rk,22205280,22210320,overturned that  yeah it would be total reproductive  rights that would be enshrined in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22210320,22216958,constitution not just  abortion but also  birth control and also things like in
UVob8FMT6Rk,22216958,22222160,vitro fertilization which now would also  be out loud out loud in michigan because
UVob8FMT6Rk,22222160,22228638,you know essentially you have an egg in  a sperm you have fertilization right  even though it occurs outside the womb
UVob8FMT6Rk,22228638,22233840,if a fertility clinic was to discard  that i believe that that would fit under
UVob8FMT6Rk,22233840,22238958,this four-year felony in our state so it  would also enshrine that into the  constitution and the answer to your
UVob8FMT6Rk,22238958,22246480,second question is no  no legislature or governor could come  along later and and somehow supersede
UVob8FMT6Rk,22246480,22252080,what would be  a provision of our constitution it would  be a constitutional right in the state
UVob8FMT6Rk,22252080,22257200,of michigan it'd be very very difficult  to remove later so when you enshrine the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22257200,22264240,right into the constitution  what specifics are in that right or does  a legislature then ha uh have the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22264240,22269280,ability to change to deal with the  specifics and for instance viability and
UVob8FMT6Rk,22269280,22276638,and things like that  so there's a little bit of wiggle room  the way that the uh the ballot proposal
UVob8FMT6Rk,22276638,22282000,reads um for later term pregnancy  although it does protect you know the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22282000,22287760,the health of the mother uh it also you  know accounts for cases where you have
UVob8FMT6Rk,22287760,22294080,fetal  um which you know  are usually the cause of you know late
UVob8FMT6Rk,22294080,22300240,term preg  abortions it would it be in that type of  situation but you know for the most part
UVob8FMT6Rk,22300240,22305520,it would provide all the protections  that most people in this state would  like to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,22305520,22312400,and it would not allow for the uh  legislature to intervene at that point  is it essentially row in training row or
UVob8FMT6Rk,22312400,22319200,is it a little or is it do you feel is  this about is this amendment uh actually  a little better than row
UVob8FMT6Rk,22319200,22325520,i'd say it's a little better than row  okay  dana nessel uh the attorney general of  michigan like i said this is uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,22325520,22332638,something i i'm sure you didn't think  you were gonna be dealing with this even  when you ran before always was a  possibility but i don't think a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,22332638,22338000,us thought this day was going to come  chuck i actually ran a commercial on  this when i ran for office in 2018. so i
UVob8FMT6Rk,22338000,22344320,had an entire commercial predicting this  and saying that i thought it would  happen uh in in my first term if i was
UVob8FMT6Rk,22344320,22350558,to be elected and that this was my  position so the voters elected me with  this information in mind so i'm just i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,22350558,22357040,just keeping my campaign promise you're  a bit more prescient uh uh and something  uh we should be well aware of dana
UVob8FMT6Rk,22357040,22362718,nessel thanks very much  thanks for having me meanwhile for folks  on the other side of this issue pro-life
UVob8FMT6Rk,22362718,22368240,activists today's supreme court ruling  is a long-awaited moment of victory  following a decades-long effort to
UVob8FMT6Rk,22368240,22373520,overturn roe joining me now as the  president of the national right to life  committee it's carol tobias carol really
UVob8FMT6Rk,22373520,22380080,appreciate you coming on and let me just  start with  with uh the 50-year campaign if you will
UVob8FMT6Rk,22380080,22385360,um  is this the end is this success or is  this the end of the beginning as far as
UVob8FMT6Rk,22385360,22390638,you're concerned  like winston churchill said this is the  end of the beginning
UVob8FMT6Rk,22390638,22396878,um it's been a 50-year battle to protect  unborn children  but we now have those battles in every
UVob8FMT6Rk,22396878,22402798,state  so we are going to be doing what we can  to affect those laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,22402798,22407920,but we know it's going to be a long long  battle to  get where we really want to be is to
UVob8FMT6Rk,22407920,22413040,protect all unborn children do you want  to see this continue to be a state issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,22413040,22419920,which was a lot of rallying cry for  years or would you eventually like to  see the federal a sort of a federal
UVob8FMT6Rk,22419920,22425760,codification against abortion a federal  ban on abortion  at this point step by step we're going
UVob8FMT6Rk,22425760,22433840,to do what we can in the states i think  everybody is realistic enough to know  that doing a federal law is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,22433840,22440718,be overwhelming uh and at that point  it's not going to happen until we get  large and general consensus among the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22440718,22446160,population and you know that's obviously  not going to happen  anytime soon
UVob8FMT6Rk,22446160,22452400,it does does natural right to life have  a do you have a  uh what you believe should be you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,22452400,22457840,should women have access to an abortion  at some point during their pregnancy or
UVob8FMT6Rk,22457840,22463040,are you  advocating for a ban at conception
UVob8FMT6Rk,22463200,22468400,what is missing from this entire debate  and the guests that you had on before me
UVob8FMT6Rk,22468400,22475040,is the fact that there is an unborn  child whose life is hanging in the  balance with every abortion that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,22475040,22481440,performed that that life ends  so no we believe that unborn child is a  human being that should be protected if
UVob8FMT6Rk,22481440,22488718,the mother's life is in danger obviously  we are not going to ask her to sacrifice  her own life uh for that of of her child
UVob8FMT6Rk,22488718,22495120,and i know so many some women who really  agonize as they go through that um but  we see the unborn child as a human being
UVob8FMT6Rk,22495120,22500480,that is deserving of protection  so it sounds like i mean i guess it goes  to windows
UVob8FMT6Rk,22500480,22507280,when does the constitutional rights of  the fetus trump the constitutional  rights of the woman
UVob8FMT6Rk,22507280,22512718,i don't think it has to be a competing  right  there are pregnancy centers that are
UVob8FMT6Rk,22512718,22519120,going to help a woman who  is going through a difficult time  many states have come forward with
UVob8FMT6Rk,22519120,22524558,programs to encourage and promote  childbirth to help a woman with
UVob8FMT6Rk,22524558,22530718,various needs whether it is  housing or some kind of
UVob8FMT6Rk,22530718,22536638,health checkup from a local nurse  i think the states are realizing that we
UVob8FMT6Rk,22536638,22543600,are going to have to  promote  childbirth and support the women in a  variety of ways the pro-life movement
UVob8FMT6Rk,22543600,22549360,has been doing that for 50 years and  that's not going to end we're going to  step up those activities because we
UVob8FMT6Rk,22549360,22555760,realize there are more women who are  going to be wanting and needing  support and care is the next is the next
UVob8FMT6Rk,22555760,22561120,step personhood uh so-called personhood  which means you know we've seen some of  those i think mississippi was one where
UVob8FMT6Rk,22561120,22567920,there was a high-profile amendment  constitutional amendment  um attempt  um is that something that you expect
UVob8FMT6Rk,22567920,22573200,national right to life to be working on  and places where you can make that a  ballot initiative
UVob8FMT6Rk,22573200,22580480,well national right to life actually  issued what we would call model  legislation  last week and that would be that
UVob8FMT6Rk,22580480,22586080,abortion is not allowed unless the  mother's life is in danger but we do  realize that in several states that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,22586080,22591920,not going to be  practical at this time so there are  other exceptions like rape and incest
UVob8FMT6Rk,22591920,22596958,that could be written into the bill  it's a model and states could look at it
UVob8FMT6Rk,22596958,22602718,and say we like this part of it we don't  like this part i really think we're  going to see a lot of different bills
UVob8FMT6Rk,22602718,22608400,coming up from the states with a lot of  different  interests and you know i don't want to
UVob8FMT6Rk,22608400,22616240,say exceptions but  some changes do you expect this to be  back in the supreme court so for  instance if if a state does pass a law
UVob8FMT6Rk,22616240,22621280,that grants  rights to the unborn that sounds like  something that would go back to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22621280,22626878,supreme court is that something you  expect to happen at some point  i think there is going to be several
UVob8FMT6Rk,22626878,22633040,court  battles over the next few years um some  of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22633040,22638718,states that support abortion are going  to um try to push the supreme court to  see if they're really going to stand
UVob8FMT6Rk,22638718,22643760,with what they did today  pro-life states will pass legislation  and i'm sure groups like planned
UVob8FMT6Rk,22643760,22648798,parenthood will come in and try to  challenge it and then we'll just see  where the where the federal you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,22648798,22654240,courts go i don't know how many of them  will reach the supreme court  but i expect court battles for a few
UVob8FMT6Rk,22654240,22659920,more years and let me ask you about  contraception um and the thing is is it  there's  some
UVob8FMT6Rk,22659920,22666000,things are seen as contraception and  some people see for instance iud view  that as a as an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,22666000,22673520,um does national right to life have a  position on contraception do they want  to see more limitations on it or are you
UVob8FMT6Rk,22673520,22679040,an organization that doesn't want to see  it touched  we have no position on contraception and
UVob8FMT6Rk,22679040,22687440,i know that is i believe it's being  brought up that is a scare tactic  i do not know of any state that is going
UVob8FMT6Rk,22687440,22692878,to or is even going to try  to  get rid of contraceptives i mean that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,22692878,22698240,that's a red herring that's being pulled  across  i don't think there's a couple  legislatures from very conservative ones
UVob8FMT6Rk,22698240,22703440,i thought i think there's not going  after contraceptives in idaho that was  that was certainly certainly i think in
UVob8FMT6Rk,22703440,22709360,being voted on at least in one or two  states what you're saying is that is not  something your organization is  campaigning on
UVob8FMT6Rk,22709360,22716080,not at all the legislation that we  promote uh specifically requires that it
UVob8FMT6Rk,22716080,22722400,the process  start with a known a woman who is known  to be pregnant
UVob8FMT6Rk,22722400,22728958,which pretty much rules out a lot of you  know questions about contraception but  we have no interest in going after that
UVob8FMT6Rk,22728958,22735760,carol tobias um from the national right  to life i know uh uh this is a pretty  big day uh and the pro-life movement uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,22735760,22741840,i appreciate you sharing a few minutes  with me sure thank you you got it well  i don't know if there's been a bigger

UVob8FMT6Rk,22954638,22959760,welcome back as i said  this is some week a day that will go  down in history and it was a pretty big
UVob8FMT6Rk,22959760,22965760,week the day the supreme court ended a  constitutional right to abortion but  it's also a week that will go down in  history for a number of reasons for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,22965760,22971280,first time in 30 years senate passed a  bipartisan bill related to guns it is  now headed to the president's desk
UVob8FMT6Rk,22971280,22976958,because the house also passed it the  same day that a supreme court ruling  made it easier to carry a gun in public
UVob8FMT6Rk,22976958,22982160,in certain states and we also heard some  stunning testimony in yesterday's  january 6 hearing former president
UVob8FMT6Rk,22982160,22988638,trump's justice department officials  described just how truly close the  country came to a constitutional crisis
UVob8FMT6Rk,22988638,22993840,individually each one of these are major  moments in politics each one has the  ability to influence voters on both
UVob8FMT6Rk,22993840,22999120,sides of the island as we head into the  midterms it's increasingly clear that  the 2016 election was one of the most
UVob8FMT6Rk,22999120,23006638,consequential in the history of this  country  i know i've got a bunch of history buffs  on here um that and i'll be curious
UVob8FMT6Rk,23006638,23013440,where you guys land on that  declaration but we've got leanne  caldwell uh who's of course the host of  washington post live anchor and early
UVob8FMT6Rk,23013440,23019360,202 co-author nice to see you brad todd  republican strategist sochi inoso former  director of communications for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23019360,23027602,democratic national committee and katie  banner brenner who covers the department  of justice for the new york times um
UVob8FMT6Rk,23028080,23034558,we'll get to the historical debate i i'm  i'm going 2016 1876 but somewhat i put
UVob8FMT6Rk,23034558,23040638,in 1932 as well but we'll go from there  um where are we going next lan and and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,23040638,23046878,say this more big picture we are piling  a lot of stuff  on the american public to sort of digest
UVob8FMT6Rk,23046878,23054878,and deal with yeah it's been a lot for  me to digest and deal with in the last  24-48 hours you know especially as a
UVob8FMT6Rk,23054878,23060718,reporter who covers congress the entire  past few weeks was focused on the gun  issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,23060718,23067680,and shockingly and surprisingly the  congress was able to do something they  passed significant gun legislation today
UVob8FMT6Rk,23067680,23073840,through the house of representatives  it's going to the president's desk and  that is completely overshadowed by
UVob8FMT6Rk,23073840,23082160,another whiplash of something that is  dramatically going to have a major  impact on the american people and
UVob8FMT6Rk,23082160,23089600,senator collins said in her statement  that this really helps to under the  supreme court decision today on row
UVob8FMT6Rk,23089600,23097040,undermines people's faith in the  institutions people are not looking for  big swings big changes they are looking
UVob8FMT6Rk,23097040,23103200,for maybe things that are incremental  and she says that this is doing damage  and she might be right look that is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,23103200,23109120,concern i mean you know we sometimes  punish anybody that tries to go too far  one way or the other is an electorate uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,23109120,23115040,katie you covering justice  um i was you know you don't always hear  this attorney general get his
UVob8FMT6Rk,23115040,23121280,sort of involved in a hot issue like  this he got very involved what what does  he think what how much does he plan on
UVob8FMT6Rk,23121280,23127440,getting involved and how states are  going to  uh try to decide how to interpret this  law sure for so first taking a step back
UVob8FMT6Rk,23127440,23132718,this is an issue that attorney general  garland has thought is a key civil  rights issue he thinks civil rights is
UVob8FMT6Rk,23132718,23138240,going to be for him he hopes that it's  part of his legacy as attorney general  and as part of that legacy he feels that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23138240,23144878,helping to protect the right to an  abortion is a top priority he was  heavily involved in the department's
UVob8FMT6Rk,23144878,23150160,argument before the supreme court on the  texas abortion law he's been heavily  involved in this so
UVob8FMT6Rk,23150160,23156160,he has said today that he wants to use  every tool that the department has in  order to help protect the right to an
UVob8FMT6Rk,23156160,23162958,abortion now as we all know those tools  are very narrow he's already called on  congress and said the only real way to
UVob8FMT6Rk,23162958,23169360,codify this right is through congress so  he's asking for that he's asking for a  bipartisan deal or any deal but would
UVob8FMT6Rk,23169360,23175280,have to be bipartisan for the department  it's protecting states rights the states  that have already passed laws that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23175280,23181840,codify and protect abortion and it's  being on the lookout for things like  curbs on travel across state lines the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23181840,23187680,department would fight that looking at  legislation around the use of medication  for abortion is there a way in which
UVob8FMT6Rk,23187680,23193680,those states laws bump up against things  that the fda has already approved you  know that's where the justice department
UVob8FMT6Rk,23193680,23199200,would intervene as well all right the  political fallout i m my initial  reaction
UVob8FMT6Rk,23199200,23204240,level the the um i hate the word use the  word enthusiasm but but that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,23204240,23209680,essentially the election intensity issue  clearly republicans a lot more
UVob8FMT6Rk,23209680,23215760,interested in this election do you think  it it ends up balancing this out a  little bit so i do think that turnout  will be up in this election i think
UVob8FMT6Rk,23215760,23220878,democrats across the board are worried  about turnout they're worried about  they're they're the party in power when
UVob8FMT6Rk,23220878,23226558,you're in the party in power you  actually have to turn out your base and  your base won't necessarily turn out  unless they have something that they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,23226558,23231600,excited about or they're angry about  well now people are really angry people  are really scared people are really
UVob8FMT6Rk,23231600,23237600,worried and i think that they will turn  out what worries me the most though is  young people young people who said i
UVob8FMT6Rk,23237600,23243680,voted in 2020 i voted for democrats i  voted for joe biden and this still  happened so what are you telling me to
UVob8FMT6Rk,23243680,23250558,do you're telling me to fix this by  going out to voting  you just told me that two years ago and  i turned out what we need to tell them
UVob8FMT6Rk,23250558,23256000,and to your point about 2016 chuck is  that elections not only have  consequences but we are feeling the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23256000,23262718,consequences of the 2016 election now  and we will continue to feel those  consequences unless we add more
UVob8FMT6Rk,23262718,23269360,governors in in red states democratic  governors and red states flip those  seats add more senators and keep the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23269360,23275040,majority that's the only way that we get  through this and so my worry is those  young voters and the democratic party
UVob8FMT6Rk,23275040,23281280,has to be spending money to talk to them  directly and tell them this is the  result of 2016. you did not necessarily
UVob8FMT6Rk,23281280,23287840,all of you turn out right we weren't  motivated to turn out you turned out in  2020 let's continue that that's the only
UVob8FMT6Rk,23287840,23293920,way that we reverse this brad the  agitated or sometimes motivated and the  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,23293920,23299120,those that are satisfied  you know okay i don't have to worry  about this anymore
UVob8FMT6Rk,23299120,23304160,this has been a great get out the vote  issue  does this at all sort of caught the car
UVob8FMT6Rk,23304160,23310878,you have the country at a 70 percent  wrong track rating for this  administration inflation's through the  roof gases
UVob8FMT6Rk,23310878,23317120,people are going to show up to vote but  you know it's it's really a good day for  the democratic process for 50 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,23317120,23323840,abortions divided our country we've been  divided every day since 1973 and today  the issue goes back to the electorate
UVob8FMT6Rk,23323840,23330400,the electorate gets to pick through its  elected officials which way it wants  this abortion policy in his states to go  so we've heard a lot of talk the last
UVob8FMT6Rk,23330400,23336400,year a lot of reflection i think about  what our democracy means if you are  serious that you think that democracy
UVob8FMT6Rk,23336400,23342000,should be controlled by the people  through elections you should be happy  today regardless of which side you're on  i want you guys to dig into something a
UVob8FMT6Rk,23342000,23348240,thesis that potentially i think that  in a real world  it abortion was used as a wedge with
UVob8FMT6Rk,23348240,23355200,democrats democrats would debate each  other about uh all right what about late  term abortions and the republicans would  usually be successful on that in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,23355200,23361280,world isn't it the republicans that  might be  having internal fights about okay where  do we draw the lines and exceptions and
UVob8FMT6Rk,23361280,23367760,are you concerned that this is going to  sort of divide the party in ways that  maybe we haven't thought about right now  well i think you know as you won't be
UVob8FMT6Rk,23367760,23374240,surprised this but i have a lot of  polling instead of battleground states  this year uh and we asked them do you  think that states should be able to
UVob8FMT6Rk,23374240,23379680,regulate abortion in senate battleground  states this year a strong majority of  them well over 50 percent say yes they
UVob8FMT6Rk,23379680,23385680,should be able to how do they want it  regulated well that's going to be  debated in state capitals for years for  two or three or five or ten years i mean
UVob8FMT6Rk,23385680,23391760,instead many states who have laws in the  books or go back and revisit them that's  going to happen in red states it's going  to happen in blue states uh but you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,23391760,23397040,we also asked people in battleground  states about the senate democrat  position which is abortion on demand any
UVob8FMT6Rk,23397040,23403280,time all the way up to birth and only 30  percent that's that's in the bill they  voted on that's the bill only 30 percent
UVob8FMT6Rk,23403280,23409120,of people in senate battleground states  agree with that that's going to be on  the ballot too  not just what what happened to the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,23409120,23414558,today but what senate democrats would  like to do if they keep control but  chuck what i would tell you is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23414558,23420400,dem republicans said and you know that  they some of them ran on overturning row
UVob8FMT6Rk,23420400,23425920,people didn't necessarily believe them  but like where does it stop and i do  think that there will be a wedge in the  republican party and you heard your
UVob8FMT6Rk,23425920,23432320,guest right before saying we're not  going to go after contraception well  people said that they were going to go  after roe for a period of time too they
UVob8FMT6Rk,23432320,23438400,will go after contraception and i think  what's interesting about the republican  party right now is they've always been  the party there's there's no there's no
UVob8FMT6Rk,23438400,23444798,state doing it there's no state no  republican in congress doing it there  are talks about it and what i will say  is the republican party has always been
UVob8FMT6Rk,23444798,23449840,about less government involved in  people's lives and this decision and  what they're pushing now is more
UVob8FMT6Rk,23449840,23455280,government they're controlling what  women  do with their bodies and you're going to  continue to see that we've seen that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23455280,23460400,from the republican party recently and  many during many many policies more  proof that abortion is overshadowing
UVob8FMT6Rk,23460400,23466000,everything i did want to sort of touch  very quickly on january 6 and especially  katie i have you here with merrick
UVob8FMT6Rk,23466000,23471280,garland and with what's it  it does feel as if as congress members
UVob8FMT6Rk,23471280,23479120,of congress are getting agitated that  the justice department was being  aggressive all of a sudden we get a lot  of  public justice department subpoenas and
UVob8FMT6Rk,23479120,23485040,uh and and  showing up at people's houses um  what's happening there and it is what's
UVob8FMT6Rk,23485040,23491200,more likely that he will charge the  president or he's going to do a special  counsel well i would say that some of is  a little bit coincidental because the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23491200,23497840,democrats were going to be mad from the  first day he took office so the idea  that the justice department would take  action while the democrats were angry
UVob8FMT6Rk,23497840,23505040,was definitely going to happen if the  justice department took action at all  in terms of whether or not he would  charge donald trump i i don't like to
UVob8FMT6Rk,23505040,23511360,predict those things because being wrong  has real consequences but i would say  two things to look at closely when you
UVob8FMT6Rk,23511360,23516718,look at what's happened with the sen oh  excuse me with the house committee's own  presentation
UVob8FMT6Rk,23516718,23521840,they have presented both new evidence  about  links between possibly illegal
UVob8FMT6Rk,23521840,23526878,unconstitutional behavior in the mouths  of republicans it's republicans saying  this to the committee this was
UVob8FMT6Rk,23526878,23533120,unconstitutional this was illegal so if  nothing else i do think that it's  helping to turn public sentiment toward
UVob8FMT6Rk,23533120,23538160,the idea that what happened was  seriously wrong there could be something  illegal about it and that is helpful i
UVob8FMT6Rk,23538160,23544798,think in any kind of prosecution  especially one that would be as touchy  and as controversial as prosecuting
UVob8FMT6Rk,23544798,23550160,somebody close to the president's inner  circle much less the president himself  the second thing to remember is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23550160,23556638,this is going to take a long time  merrick garland is going to move slowly  and deliberately if you look at the  oklahoma city bombing from the day of
UVob8FMT6Rk,23556638,23562240,the bombing until the day that the  guilty verdict was handed in it was  almost two years that was one crime one
UVob8FMT6Rk,23562240,23567760,charge they apprehended the suspect  almost immediately it was still two  years this is much more complicated
UVob8FMT6Rk,23567760,23573280,leanne the fallout of the pardon asks  there is this  it's you know i had somebody asked me
UVob8FMT6Rk,23573280,23579600,this all the one all these republican  congressmen asked for pardons  does it politically hurt them at all
UVob8FMT6Rk,23579600,23585120,look at the districts that they are  fraud no it doesn't hurt them  politically at all well the matt gates  is a serious primary challenge
UVob8FMT6Rk,23585120,23591120,challenger i i you know that is actually  using some of this yeah  but i mean there's a lot
UVob8FMT6Rk,23591120,23597120,you know the pardon thing i don't think  as much however there is the issue of  january 6 and how republicans acted
UVob8FMT6Rk,23597120,23602240,about responded to this process is an  issue in the primaries did you vote for
UVob8FMT6Rk,23602240,23609360,the creation of an independent  commission did you uh support how are  you responding to january 6 now take the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23609360,23616000,primary on tuesday rodney davis versus  an incumbent tuesday yeah mary miller  rodney davis voted he he was on the he
UVob8FMT6Rk,23616000,23621360,was appointed he may lead the next  january 6 committee if he's in congress  right exactly he has lots of backing but
UVob8FMT6Rk,23621360,23628958,trump backed mary miller because of his  position on january 6. unfortunately i  have hit the time limit uh leanne katie
UVob8FMT6Rk,23628958,23634160,brad and sochi thank you all thank you  all for being with us this hour we'll be  back monday with more meet the press now

UVob8FMT6Rk,23659600,23665600,across this country a decision from the  supreme court that has people in some  states waking up with a constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,23665600,23672000,right to an abortion and now dinner time  on friday night no longer have that  right we're getting into this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,23672000,23678240,by the supreme court to overturn roe  versus wade the reaction from people who  support and oppose abortion rights the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23678240,23685120,reaction from white house from capitol  hill part of my conversation with two  democratic lawmakers who are now  strategizing to think up anyway to try
UVob8FMT6Rk,23685120,23690798,to codify abortion right protection  federally and president biden he's  slamming the court and saying it's now
UVob8FMT6Rk,23690798,23697920,up to voters we're also live on the  ground in states where abortion just  today has become illegal essentially or
UVob8FMT6Rk,23697920,23703680,may soon be banned with reaction from  michigan mississippi florida and  missouri more on what comes next we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,23703680,23710000,also live in california which is looking  to expand abortion protections with new  concerns about what this means for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23710000,23717360,economy this court decision and the  impact on millions of americans we'll  get into what the research shows about  how some may now end up in poverty we'll
UVob8FMT6Rk,23717360,23723520,also take you to a clinic in one of the  few states that allows late-term  abortions to see if it'll change their  practices that's coming up in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23723520,23729680,original later on in the show  hey i'm halle and this morning in at  least six states okay people woke up
UVob8FMT6Rk,23729680,23735520,with the right to abortion access  tonight that right is gone more states  will follow because right now you've got
UVob8FMT6Rk,23735520,23741840,a country trying to process this new era  after the supreme court's historic  landmark decision to overturn roe versus
UVob8FMT6Rk,23741840,23747280,wade the decision led by the  conservative majority ends the  constitutional federal right to have an
UVob8FMT6Rk,23747280,23752320,abortion it's a right that people in  this country have had for the past 49  years and the first time ever that the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23752320,23758080,court has granted a right to americans  and then taken it away  you can see the makeup of those on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23758080,23763920,decision on your screen and this now  here this is a live look as we speak  outside the supreme court these crowds
UVob8FMT6Rk,23763920,23769520,these demonstrators they have been there  all day long since before 10 o'clock in  the morning you have some in tears
UVob8FMT6Rk,23769520,23774638,devastated you have some in tears of joy  cheering after decades of organizing
UVob8FMT6Rk,23774638,23781680,listen to some just some of what we've  heard in the last couple hours  to see us going back to knitting needles
UVob8FMT6Rk,23781680,23787440,and the whole thing  i just i'm stunned i'm excited to raise  my kids
UVob8FMT6Rk,23787440,23794240,and have grandchildren inside of a post  row america knowing other mothers out  there
UVob8FMT6Rk,23795840,23801360,you can't make a choice  it's pretty hard human rights start at
UVob8FMT6Rk,23801360,23807120,conception and end at natural death and  that is what i'm going to fight for  until the day that i die
UVob8FMT6Rk,23807120,23812798,this decision is only backed by justices  appointed by republican presidents three  from former president trump who you're
UVob8FMT6Rk,23812798,23818080,going to hear about more in just a bit  the decision written by justice samuel  alito an opinion that's pretty much in
UVob8FMT6Rk,23818080,23823920,line with that leaked draft we learned  about in may one that was written back  in february justice alito writes quote
UVob8FMT6Rk,23823920,23830400,the constitution makes no reference to  abortion and no such right is implicitly  protected by any constitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,23830400,23835520,provision he says it is time to heed the  constitution and return the issue of  abortion to people's elected
UVob8FMT6Rk,23835520,23840958,representatives okay so what does that  mean it means that we are now becoming a  divided country on the issue of abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,23840958,23847520,access look at this map okay you know  the states in red these are states that  are already doing something about it  they have so-called trigger laws that
UVob8FMT6Rk,23847520,23854558,were in place for this exact scenario if  the court did exactly what the court did  today that would basically flip a switch
UVob8FMT6Rk,23854558,23859680,and move to ban abortion altogether some  are total bands no exceptions some have
UVob8FMT6Rk,23859680,23865360,some exceptions for rape incest or the  health of the mother  in six of those states as we said those
UVob8FMT6Rk,23865360,23871920,bands are in effect right now that is  the lightning speed at which this has  unfolded in just the past seven hours in
UVob8FMT6Rk,23871920,23877440,this country we've got another 14 states  that have an outright banned abortion  but they have restricted
UVob8FMT6Rk,23877440,23883360,abortion access significantly to  viability right less than the 24-week  standard that roe said they're all
UVob8FMT6Rk,23883360,23888638,candidates to go even further in their  abortion bans  so that leaves 23 states the states in
UVob8FMT6Rk,23888638,23894478,blue you see on your screen where  abortion is right now still legal some  of those states are trying to strengthen  their laws trying to boost protection
UVob8FMT6Rk,23894478,23899680,basically  bracing for more women coming in  possibly from states nearby
UVob8FMT6Rk,23899680,23904958,where abortion is going to become  illegal  we should note here too the political  backdrop to this most americans based on
UVob8FMT6Rk,23904958,23911200,polling don't support what the supreme  court has done our most recent numbers  here at nbc find 63 percent of americans
UVob8FMT6Rk,23911200,23916718,didn't think that the court should  overturn roe just 30 percent do and in  just the last couple hours we heard from
UVob8FMT6Rk,23916718,23922718,president biden slamming the court and  saying restoring this right is now up to  voters
UVob8FMT6Rk,23922718,23928878,with this decision  the conservative majority of the supreme  court shows how extreme it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,23928878,23934240,how far removed they are from the  majority of this country my  administration will use all of its
UVob8FMT6Rk,23934240,23939760,appropriate lawful powers  but congress must act
UVob8FMT6Rk,23939760,23947360,and with your vote  you can act  you can have the final word
UVob8FMT6Rk,23947520,23954080,so here it is again live right now  outside the supreme court where  protesters both for and against abortion  rights are coming out they are showing
UVob8FMT6Rk,23954080,23959840,up they are using their voices that's  one of a ton of angles we're going to be  covering over the next 90 minutes  including the political reaction and
UVob8FMT6Rk,23959840,23964878,live reports from states where abortion  is now illegal but let's start here in  washington with the man who covers this
UVob8FMT6Rk,23964878,23970798,court pete williams and pete let me  start with what is happening now as we  speak just several hours ago we saw
UVob8FMT6Rk,23970798,23977360,arkansas i believe become the latest  state with one of these trigger laws to  formally say yes abortion is now banned
UVob8FMT6Rk,23977360,23984160,in our state bringing the total i think  to six where does that stand right now  you're right six and more to come uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,23984160,23989600,some of these trigger laws say that the  states could act immediately those are  the ones we've seen so far some say they
UVob8FMT6Rk,23989600,23996958,would act after 10 days some after 30.  so within a month you'll see all the 13  trigger laws fall into line and then the
UVob8FMT6Rk,23996958,24004478,rest of those states that you had on the  map earlier will probably ban abortion  within the next several weeks after that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24004478,24011760,let me go back to this decision by  justice alito who says abortion is not  deeply rooted as he put it in this  nation's history and tradition explain
UVob8FMT6Rk,24011760,24016878,what the ruling means and what else we  should take away from it  well the reason he said that is this he
UVob8FMT6Rk,24016878,24023280,said you can't find a right to abortion  in the constitution so the right that it  derives from according to the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,24023280,24028878,court is partly the 14th amendment the  equal protection amendment that  everybody knows about but also
UVob8FMT6Rk,24028878,24034478,guarantees due process and what he says  is  you can only find you can only get to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24034478,24040320,abortion rights through that if a right  based on an earlier supreme court  decision that actually had to do with
UVob8FMT6Rk,24040320,24046718,whether there's a right to assisted  suicide he said the test is is the right  deeply rooted in history and tradition
UVob8FMT6Rk,24046718,24053120,and essential to a concept of ordered  liberty and he says if you look back at  the founding and at the time of the 14th
UVob8FMT6Rk,24053120,24059760,amendment most states  made abortion a crime now there are  scholars who say he's wrong about that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24059760,24066558,but that's the basis on which he he  bases his decision and so he says  same-sex marriage i'm sorry abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,24066558,24073280,flunks that test but  as as others have pointed out so does  contraception same-sex marriage
UVob8FMT6Rk,24073280,24078718,interracial marriage the right to decide  where your children are going to school  lots of other rights as well
UVob8FMT6Rk,24078718,24084798,both the president and the department of  justice are pointing out one of the  concurring opinions from justice brett  kavanaugh which says that states cannot
UVob8FMT6Rk,24084798,24090240,restrict travel for women who live in  let's say arkansas or one of these other  states where trigger laws have either
UVob8FMT6Rk,24090240,24095280,just gone into effect or will go into  effect so help us  understand this right give us the gut
UVob8FMT6Rk,24095280,24101680,check here this means then that women  who live in states where abortion will  now be outlawed can travel to states if
UVob8FMT6Rk,24101680,24108080,they have the means the money and the  ability to do so where abortion is legal  to obtain the procedure yes there's no  restrictions on that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24108080,24115440,so let's explain why we say that that is  the case this was a five to four ruling  on whether to uphold roe six to three on
UVob8FMT6Rk,24115440,24121760,whether to uphold the mississippi law  which is how this got started in the  first place because it was five to four
UVob8FMT6Rk,24121760,24128718,if kavanaugh didn't join it it would  only be four that wouldn't be a majority  so his concurrence is controlling and
UVob8FMT6Rk,24128718,24133760,that's why he says in his opinion  uh states should not be able to ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,24133760,24140638,people to travel from other states but  it it has i think the force of law  because he is the controlling
UVob8FMT6Rk,24140638,24146320,concurrence so  so i think you could easily read this  decision to say that states can't make
UVob8FMT6Rk,24146320,24153360,it a crime for someone in a banned state  to travel to a state where abortion is  legal in order to obtain the abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,24153360,24160240,now there are other questions can  medical professionals help them do that  can they give them that advice um you
UVob8FMT6Rk,24160240,24165840,know i'm not sure about that and it'll  depend a lot on these trigger laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,24165840,24171920,talked about justice leader's opinion i  want to read from the dissent written by  justice breyer signed by the three  liberals on the court saying that quote
UVob8FMT6Rk,24171920,24178558,after today  young women will come of age with fewer  rights than their mothers and  grandmothers had and i find that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24178558,24184160,significant pete because i think it  speaks to the arc and the scope of this  moment and how generational it is right
UVob8FMT6Rk,24184160,24190400,a right that has been in place for  nearly 50 years you have covered the  court a long time you are not at all  prone to hyperbole which i appreciate
UVob8FMT6Rk,24190400,24196718,pete so help us understand the  significance of this moment  well what you have here is now the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24196718,24202798,supreme court super majority has the  votes to do what many of the members of  the court have wanted to do for a long
UVob8FMT6Rk,24202798,24209520,time certainly alito and thomas have  wanted the court to  strike down roe for years and years but
UVob8FMT6Rk,24209520,24216240,they've never had enough votes to do it  now with the three choices by president  trump the three nominees from trump they
UVob8FMT6Rk,24216240,24222718,do now have the votes it was a five to  four decision on that chief justice  roberts didn't join them so that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,24222718,24229360,really what's changed here i i think you  can't underestimate the force of  president trump's nominees and remember
UVob8FMT6Rk,24229360,24235520,that while you know they would tell you  that they they've made this decision  based on their view of the facts on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24235520,24241520,law remember that president trump said  he would put  justices on the court who would quote be
UVob8FMT6Rk,24241520,24248240,pro-life and so it would appear that his  prediction came true  pete williams thank you you've done
UVob8FMT6Rk,24248240,24255200,yeoman's work today i appreciate it we  look forward to seeing more of you on  nightly news i want to go to julia  ainsley who is outside of the court and  julia at the top of the show we saw some
UVob8FMT6Rk,24255200,24260718,of the action there give us a sense of  what you're hearing from protesters  today
UVob8FMT6Rk,24261280,24266878,well the crowd has just grown thicker  and thicker every hour i've been out  here halle you hear people behind me
UVob8FMT6Rk,24266878,24273120,right now on bull horns calling for  people to stay calling for action  calling for congress to take action to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24273120,24278958,codify roe so that even with this  opinion today that the federal  government could have a say in
UVob8FMT6Rk,24278958,24284878,restricting states from banning  abortions now i've talked to people on  both sides of this issue you want to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,24284878,24291120,how divided our country is especially on  this issue look no further than where  i'm standing right now i spoke to one
UVob8FMT6Rk,24291120,24297680,woman who is jewish and reminded me that  in the jewish faith they say that life  begins at the first breath and she had a
UVob8FMT6Rk,24297680,24303760,pretty bold way  to show how she felt about the opinion  today let's take a look at what she had
UVob8FMT6Rk,24303760,24312080,to say and how she showed her feelings  because everyone is talking about murder
UVob8FMT6Rk,24312080,24319760,and  it's just it's me it's not somebody else  yet i have a child this is a person this
UVob8FMT6Rk,24319760,24324878,is a person with will this is a person  who has decision making power and this
UVob8FMT6Rk,24324878,24331200,is me  [Music]  so hallie you can see there she's
UVob8FMT6Rk,24331200,24338240,walking through with a nine-month  pregnant belly she said she's actually  due tomorrow and was already in the  early stages of labor
UVob8FMT6Rk,24338240,24343520,she was there with her one and a half  year old and she said now this is a  child this is a human who has a right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24343520,24350558,life but she said that she did not think  it was murder  because she wrote on her pregnant belly
UVob8FMT6Rk,24350558,24356400,not yet a human a very stark  way to show how she feels about this and
UVob8FMT6Rk,24356400,24362718,of course she did expect some people in  this crowd to be upset with what she  chose to say on her
UVob8FMT6Rk,24362718,24367760,very pregnant belly  uh an incredibly active scene behind you  there at the court julie ainslie thank
UVob8FMT6Rk,24367760,24372798,you so much for that when you talk about  where does this fight go from here right  that is the key question i've talked
UVob8FMT6Rk,24372798,24378878,with activists and advocates on both  sides of this issue and  unanimously the fight goes to the states
UVob8FMT6Rk,24378878,24384080,they say it goes to congress right two  of those sort of branches or areas you
UVob8FMT6Rk,24384080,24390798,just saw a live shot of ali vitale who  is on capitol hill so spoiler alert yes  we're going to talk about the congress  piece of this alley because that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,24390798,24397520,where in many ways people are looking to  for guidance because we'll get to the  white house we'll talk about president  biden there there's only so much that he
UVob8FMT6Rk,24397520,24402878,can do unilaterally right you need to  force the legislative branch in many  ways or the force of state houses on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24402878,24407920,local level we've seen the direction  that is headed i want to start here by  playing a little bit i had a chance to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24407920,24413840,talk to two members of congress who have  both spoken in personal terms very  personal terms about what abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,24413840,24419200,access means to them  representative congressman jackie speer  congresswoman ayanna presley i want to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24419200,24425840,play a little bit of our conversation  how much do you believe this supreme  court as it is currently made up could
UVob8FMT6Rk,24425840,24431360,roll back where we are  i think it's a very real threat that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,24431360,24437120,right this is not a drill this sets a  dangerous precedent that would allow the  court to undermine other fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,24437120,24443360,human rights there's no load that these  people  won't go
UVob8FMT6Rk,24443360,24448718,help us with the reality check  ali of what democrats realistically can
UVob8FMT6Rk,24448718,24453760,do  with the current makeup of congress as  it stands today
UVob8FMT6Rk,24453760,24459760,not much and i think that's the wall  that democratic lawmakers that i've been  talking to have been running up against
UVob8FMT6Rk,24459760,24465760,over the course of the last few weeks  there was the moment where they saw that  leaked draft opinion of what ultimately
UVob8FMT6Rk,24465760,24471680,ended up happening today officially and  over the last few weeks they have been  brainstorming what they can do at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24471680,24478240,federal level but honestly short of  legislation and they tried that route  and it failed in the senate they are not
UVob8FMT6Rk,24478240,24483440,able to really do anything that shores  up or codifies abortion access in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24483440,24489920,way that democrats believe is necessary  now that roe is officially no longer the  law of the land it's why we've seen
UVob8FMT6Rk,24489920,24496958,senators ask the white house to do  things like executive orders around the  abortion pill around ensuring that women
UVob8FMT6Rk,24496958,24504080,can travel between states and have the  resources to do that one group of  senators even suggested at one point uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,24504080,24511440,putting a point person at health and  human services to sort of head up a  reproductive rights piece of that agency
UVob8FMT6Rk,24511440,24516638,these are things the biden  administration hasn't done they are  things that they say they are open to or
UVob8FMT6Rk,24516638,24522718,thinking about but they've been pretty  non-committal about this and it leaves  lawmakers with a lot of anger but not a
UVob8FMT6Rk,24522718,24528240,lot that they can actually do  you look at one of the things that i've  heard a lot about is does this the  question gets asked right how is this
UVob8FMT6Rk,24528240,24533840,going to mobilize voters ali we'll talk  in a little bit with chuck and some  others about the repercussions of what
UVob8FMT6Rk,24533840,24539120,happened now six years ago in 2016 and  that campaign and that election and the  way that that has set us up for this
UVob8FMT6Rk,24539120,24544478,moment now i was on the campaign trail  then as you know as you were too and i  would code all the republican candidates
UVob8FMT6Rk,24544478,24549600,and i would go into these rooms in iowa  and south carolina small events not big  donald trump rallies right this is stuff
UVob8FMT6Rk,24549600,24555760,with like carly fiorina and ben carson  and ted cruz and people would talk about
UVob8FMT6Rk,24555760,24561280,how important the supreme court was to  them it was a it was an  anecdotally immobilizing issue for many
UVob8FMT6Rk,24561280,24568080,people that i talked with right you look  at the numbers now okay you flash  forward to 2022. before this the leaked
UVob8FMT6Rk,24568080,24574638,supreme court draft opinion came out in  may  very few people thought abortion was the  biggest issue facing this country just
UVob8FMT6Rk,24574638,24579920,three percent  that number more than tripled  in may when we went back and asked that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24579920,24585600,same question to 10 of people you look  at that line you look at the trajectory  of that line ally and i wonder what that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24585600,24590718,says to lawmakers particularly on the  democratic side who are hoping that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,24590718,24595920,does mobilize voters ahead of the  midterms  what that line says to me is at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24595920,24602400,beginning you have 49 years of precedent  where women and voters have not had to  think about this issue as something that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24602400,24607600,was a tangible threat to them and as you  see it go up it's the general cognizance
UVob8FMT6Rk,24607600,24614638,of the country realizing that now this  right that they had for nearly five  decades is actually no longer there and
UVob8FMT6Rk,24614638,24620160,that's what democrats are banking on the  people who i'm talking to both on the  advocacy side on the campaign side here
UVob8FMT6Rk,24620160,24626000,in congress they're banking on the fact  that as people become aware that they  have lost something that a right was
UVob8FMT6Rk,24626000,24632718,taken away from them that they will then  be energized to vote because i think the  key issue when i look at polling i like
UVob8FMT6Rk,24632718,24638958,to look at enthusiasm i think that that  gauge is one of the most important  things republicans were winning on
UVob8FMT6Rk,24638958,24645360,enthusiasm now we see democrats having  many things but this key issue to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,24645360,24650878,energized around and that's what  democrats are really hoping for because  as much as people in congress are saying
UVob8FMT6Rk,24650878,24656558,hey we got to look to the states on  what's next on this you got to look to  the states so that those states then can
UVob8FMT6Rk,24656558,24662798,elect people to this body and they won't  run up against these margins that they  have right now a 50 50 senate where they
UVob8FMT6Rk,24662798,24668878,cannot get anything done just democrats  alone a very tight margin for nancy  pelosi running the house that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,24668878,24675520,democrats hope here we know what history  tells us typically about midterms for a  first-term president and how the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24675520,24680558,shellacking tends to go there but they  are trying to use this to turn that tide
UVob8FMT6Rk,24680558,24686558,there's also some discussion now from  some democratic senators including one  that i spoke with about whether justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,24686558,24693600,brett kavanaugh neil gorsuch amy coney  barrett misled them during their  confirmation hearings because they  testified about roe versus wade being
UVob8FMT6Rk,24693600,24699280,precedent that's a line to watch i think  as this unfolds too ali vitelli thank  you for being with us and for being so
UVob8FMT6Rk,24699280,24704638,on top of your beat appreciate it  the white house beat you've got  president biden today emotional
UVob8FMT6Rk,24704638,24712080,he was angry right he was passionate  about this calling the supreme court  decision a very solemn moment watch
UVob8FMT6Rk,24712080,24718080,the supreme court of the united states  expressly took away  a constitutional right from the american
UVob8FMT6Rk,24718080,24724558,people  that it already recognized that's never  been done to a right so important to so
UVob8FMT6Rk,24724558,24730320,many americans but they did it  it's a sad day for the court and for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24730320,24735920,country  vice president kamala harris was also in  illinois speaking about this very
UVob8FMT6Rk,24735920,24741200,intensely saying this is not over  you have the power
UVob8FMT6Rk,24741200,24748718,to elect leaders who will defend and  protect your rights  and as the president said earlier today
UVob8FMT6Rk,24748718,24755280,with your vote you can act  and you have the final word
UVob8FMT6Rk,24755280,24761520,but the administration seems to  recognize that the president's power to  protect access to abortion via executive  action right the unilateral thing that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24761520,24768160,the president can do on his own it's  pretty limited that's why he's looking  at congress right he's looking at the  building that ali vitale was just in to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24768160,24773200,say hey restore those protections of roe  as a federal law  and then you heard the vice president
UVob8FMT6Rk,24773200,24778798,say yeah voters you've got to put more  lawmakers the democrats say into that  building that you see on your screen so
UVob8FMT6Rk,24778798,24784080,that they can help  put in place federal protections of roe  into law
UVob8FMT6Rk,24784080,24790478,the president biden is laying out some  of what his own administration and  federal agencies can do to try to help a  woman get access in some ways like
UVob8FMT6Rk,24790478,24795920,defending women who now have to travel  to another state for care and protecting  access to contraception and abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,24795920,24802000,pills joining me now is josh letterman  josh this issue of abortion medication  is particularly interesting right
UVob8FMT6Rk,24802000,24807840,because this is an area where the byte  administration can work through federal  agencies to help maintain access to some
UVob8FMT6Rk,24807840,24814558,abortion services no that's exactly  right and that is exactly what the white  house says that they are doing today uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,24814558,24821600,president biden saying that he is  directing the health and home the health  and  human services department to figure out
UVob8FMT6Rk,24821600,24828718,whatever they can do  to maximize access to abortion  medications for people to be able to use
UVob8FMT6Rk,24828718,24836558,that as an option if getting a surgical  abortion is no longer a possibility  including according to the white house
UVob8FMT6Rk,24836558,24842160,access to telehealth and to  prescriptions by mail so that is one
UVob8FMT6Rk,24842160,24848558,pillar of what the white house is doing  in response to the ruling today the  other major pillar has to do with travel
UVob8FMT6Rk,24848558,24854718,particularly for women who are going  from one state where it's no longer  legal to another state president biden
UVob8FMT6Rk,24854718,24859840,saying the justice department is going  to fight any state or local officials
UVob8FMT6Rk,24859840,24867440,who tried to interfere in someone's  ability to go to another state which is  not something that today's decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,24867440,24874240,precludes but the reality is that's  about all that this white house can do  hallie president biden openly
UVob8FMT6Rk,24874240,24880240,acknowledging today that it's not like  he can whip out an executive order and  with the stroke of a pen restore a right
UVob8FMT6Rk,24880240,24886240,that the supreme court today said  doesn't exist  we're also hearing from former president
UVob8FMT6Rk,24886240,24892240,trump today josh who says this decision  was only made possible because he says  he delivered everything as promised
UVob8FMT6Rk,24892240,24897280,including nominating and getting three  highly respected and strong  constitutionalists confirmed to the u.s
UVob8FMT6Rk,24897280,24902798,supreme court that is something that  president biden went after in his speech  he went after the three justices that
UVob8FMT6Rk,24902798,24908558,donald trump appointed justices we've  talked about a gorsuch kavanaugh amy  coney barrett talking about why 2016 is
UVob8FMT6Rk,24908558,24916798,so important is part of his pitch to get  people out to vote in the next election  it feels like this is another um
UVob8FMT6Rk,24916798,24923200,flash point josh as we look ahead not  just to the midterms but potentially to  2024.  it isn't it was so interesting to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,24923200,24930000,the president in the cross hall of the  white house this kind of very stately  atmosphere bringing up former president
UVob8FMT6Rk,24930000,24935840,trump someone he doesn't like to talk  about very much talking in explicitly  political terms about voters need to go
UVob8FMT6Rk,24935840,24941120,elect politicians who will do x y and z  um you know given that really the only
UVob8FMT6Rk,24941120,24946558,way forward on this uh for people who  support abortion rights is to try to get
UVob8FMT6Rk,24946558,24951760,some type of codification through  federal law but the reality is you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,24951760,24958400,even if this were to seriously play in  democrats favor and you have this  enormous enthusiasm and democrats end up
UVob8FMT6Rk,24958400,24964558,doing much better in the midterms then a  lot of people predict that they will  based on historical trends
UVob8FMT6Rk,24964558,24970878,nobody's talking about the possibility  of democrats emerging with a senate uh  you know a filibuster-proof majority in
UVob8FMT6Rk,24970878,24977600,the senate or anything close to that the  numbers that democrats at this point  would have to accumulate to be able to
UVob8FMT6Rk,24977600,24983680,pass what they're talking about today  into law is far more than they're likely  to be able to get realistically in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,24983680,24990240,short term and that's one reason that  this political message is very difficult  for the president to make to supporters
UVob8FMT6Rk,24990240,24996080,it's very hard to promise them that  there will be action on this in the  short term even as democrats try to use
UVob8FMT6Rk,24996080,25002080,this for maximum advantage to draw  contacts with republicans in the  midterms  josh letterman live outside the white
UVob8FMT6Rk,25002080,25008400,house josh thank you appreciate it i  want to bring in now our political  director and host of meet the press  chuck todd who is joining us now
UVob8FMT6Rk,25008400,25013920,chuck there's a lot to get to and let me  stay on this thread because you and i  were um on the air with lester holt  during the special report when this
UVob8FMT6Rk,25013920,25019760,first broke and you made a point that i  think is really worth repeating here  which was as we talk about donald trump
UVob8FMT6Rk,25019760,25025200,and as josh has laid out that backdrop  here that it was three trump appointed  justices that led to this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,25025200,25032478,you said something like we might be  looking back on the 2016  presidential election as the most  consequential of not just our lifetime
UVob8FMT6Rk,25032478,25037680,but of our grandparents lifetimes and  their grandparents lifetimes  yeah no i think it i think you could
UVob8FMT6Rk,25037680,25043040,make an argument and look i'm not going  to sit here and debate which is one two  or three but you can make an argument  that
UVob8FMT6Rk,25043040,25049840,2016 on the long tail of it and and all  of the fallout has happened from it and  it's sort of like a bunch of threads
UVob8FMT6Rk,25049840,25056478,sort of pulled on the fabric of the  democracy the fabric of our society  really not since the 1876 election could
UVob8FMT6Rk,25056478,25064558,i go back and say we had a presidential  election that the fallout from it  had such far-reaching consequences for
UVob8FMT6Rk,25064558,25071680,decades and that one did took nearly 100  years to recover from that one uh when  you think about that one goddess jim
UVob8FMT6Rk,25071680,25077520,crow laws and all of that so  look this long tail it is not you know  we we use the phrase a lot elections
UVob8FMT6Rk,25077520,25082958,have consequences some elections have  more consequences than others and it's  pretty clear the 2016 election is one
UVob8FMT6Rk,25082958,25089520,that had enormous consequences look  three supreme court justices in in one  term is something that's just
UVob8FMT6Rk,25089520,25095120,shocking that it happened  but it's also of course how it happened  which is why you know my greater fear
UVob8FMT6Rk,25095120,25100638,here hallie is that we we've already had  a former president essentially stoke
UVob8FMT6Rk,25100638,25106958,fear in  the legal system right attack the  justice department attack institutions
UVob8FMT6Rk,25106958,25113680,and now you have a supreme court where i  think many  progressives many democrats feel as it  was a rigged court right
UVob8FMT6Rk,25113680,25119760,two of the nominees shouldn't have  really been nominated when they were and  how it was done my point is this hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,25119760,25125520,doesn't matter how we get there we can  have a majority of this country has  questions about our rule of law for
UVob8FMT6Rk,25125520,25130558,different reasons  and that is not how a constitutional  republic stays healthy
UVob8FMT6Rk,25130558,25136080,pull on that thread a little chuck i'm  going to bring it back to the supreme  court because what you heard and i know  you saw what congresswoman alexandria
UVob8FMT6Rk,25136080,25142000,ocasio-cortez said today questioning is  exactly to your point here the the  makeup of the court the justices on the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25142000,25147920,court there's this gallup tracking poll  showing that americans  have they're at an all-time low as far
UVob8FMT6Rk,25147920,25154718,as confidence in the court right 25 i  mean that is  that's a stark that is a stark number
UVob8FMT6Rk,25154718,25160558,chuck um how how like i ask you this and  i know that you can't really answer it  but like for the sake of this discussion
UVob8FMT6Rk,25160558,25165920,how does this change right like when you  have when you take this when you take  what we saw in the january six hearings
UVob8FMT6Rk,25165920,25173202,for example when you look at the way  that when you take it holistically where  we are at this moment in the country how  does it change
UVob8FMT6Rk,25173280,25178320,uh  honestly i think it's  it would take an outside threat to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25178320,25183920,entire country to get us to get our to  to sort of figure out how to overlook  some of our divisions i think we're at a
UVob8FMT6Rk,25183920,25190240,really low point  um our we're questioning institutions  let me just put that 25 in perspective
UVob8FMT6Rk,25190240,25196958,that that's  we used to say when congress was that  low it's even lower now confidence and  you know approval of that institution
UVob8FMT6Rk,25196958,25203120,but that was a given and we sort of and  what has happened the supreme court now  is being looked at the way we look at
UVob8FMT6Rk,25203120,25208478,congress and that is the  the real fear here is that all the black  robes are no longer black they're red
UVob8FMT6Rk,25208478,25214638,and blue  in the eyes of everybody these days and  right now appears very bright red among  the red robes
UVob8FMT6Rk,25214638,25222240,in that supreme court  but look i i just think we're we're  it's that um
UVob8FMT6Rk,25222240,25228400,you know i you ask what i mean i i know  that's going to sound silly aliens  attacking i mean the point is is that i
UVob8FMT6Rk,25228400,25234638,think that we are some right we are our  own worst enemy right now and i don't  know when it ends we're we're we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,25234638,25241280,we're years from getting to a place for  this i mean look i do think that  if you were to attack our problem our
UVob8FMT6Rk,25241280,25248080,problem is that we do have extremes  deciding mainstream decisions  and i think the way we've chosen
UVob8FMT6Rk,25248080,25253120,nominees and the way we've elected our  politicians  favor those on the far ends of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25253120,25258798,political spectrum particularly more so  on the right these days than ever before  i think we have to think about how we
UVob8FMT6Rk,25258798,25266718,how we nominate people top four things  like this what we're seeing in alaska  i i we that's that's would be one place
UVob8FMT6Rk,25266718,25273040,to sort of if people that sit between  the 30 yard lines hallie you know if you  will right of sort of feel as if they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,25273040,25278718,in the large middle they're not  represented by today's um elected  officials and certainly not by the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25278718,25285600,supreme court  um  so you i think you got to tackle it at  that source of sort of how we nominate
UVob8FMT6Rk,25285600,25291360,our candidates which is i mean systemic  jack right when you're talking about  foundational types of change yes this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,25291360,25296400,systemic and that's my point it's gonna  this is  we have we've pulled some threads we had
UVob8FMT6Rk,25296400,25301680,some uncomfortable stability here  and donald trump came in and in one way
UVob8FMT6Rk,25301680,25308878,or another essentially was it was a  political wrecking ball uh both directly  and indirectly and here we are
UVob8FMT6Rk,25308878,25314478,chuck todd thank you for being with us  thanks for staying uh i appreciate it i  know you're gonna have a big show coming  up on sunday i think folks looking
UVob8FMT6Rk,25314478,25319840,forward to that appreciate it  coming up michigan has a nearly  century-old law dating back to 1931 that
UVob8FMT6Rk,25319840,25326638,bans most abortions in the state but a  temporary hold is stopping it from going  into effect we're live on the ground in

UVob8FMT6Rk,25513280,25520220,making headlines around the world  whenever it happens wherever you are  it's here now
UVob8FMT6Rk,25520220,25526558,[Music]  we've talked about how in just the  course of the last seven hours or so
UVob8FMT6Rk,25526558,25532400,we've seen at least six states pull the  so-called trigger on trigger bans as it
UVob8FMT6Rk,25532400,25538958,relates to abortion after the supreme  court ruling overturning roe versus wade  and one state on the brink here hasn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,25538958,25545120,done it yet it's michigan this issue is  now front and center in november for  them and that's because of this really
UVob8FMT6Rk,25545120,25551680,interesting history here you are looking  at a piece of a statute from 1931 way  back in the old days okay and this old
UVob8FMT6Rk,25551680,25558240,law says that michigan  cannot be allowed to have abortions it  would criminalize abortions calls them a
UVob8FMT6Rk,25558240,25564160,felony there are no exceptions for rape  or incest there's only one exception to  preserve the life of the mother
UVob8FMT6Rk,25564160,25570320,now right now that law is not in effect  because it's been temporarily blocked  it's been temporarily put on hold
UVob8FMT6Rk,25570320,25576878,because of this lawsuit that the planned  parenthood group in michigan filed back  in april that would stop the state from  enforcing the law okay a state judge
UVob8FMT6Rk,25576878,25583440,ruled in favor of planned parenthood  last month so that means it's 1931 law  the pause is pressed on that it is on
UVob8FMT6Rk,25583440,25588878,hold  i talked with michigan governor gretchen  whitmer today  who filed a motion just a few hours ago
UVob8FMT6Rk,25588878,25594558,in the state's supreme court to  basically keep that pause in place to  protect abortion access and by the way
UVob8FMT6Rk,25594558,25600080,the political backdrop here she's up for  re-election in november here's what the  governor told me
UVob8FMT6Rk,25600080,25608558,do you believe that this could be a  galvanizing moment for democrats in  november in these midterm elections
UVob8FMT6Rk,25608558,25613840,well i got to tell you 70 percent of the  people of the state support a woman's  right to make her own health care
UVob8FMT6Rk,25613840,25619200,decision  the most important economic decision a  woman will make over the course of her
UVob8FMT6Rk,25619200,25626160,whole lifetime is whether and when to  have a child i do think you're going to  see a whole new level of engagement and
UVob8FMT6Rk,25626160,25632080,i want every pro-choice person whether  you're democrat independent or  republican to know you've got a space at
UVob8FMT6Rk,25632080,25638000,my table you need to join this fight  i want to bring in now in michigan dasha
UVob8FMT6Rk,25638000,25644718,burns and dasha we talked about this  injunction this this restrictive law  that is temporarily blocked how you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,25644718,25650878,you heard from from governor whitmer  there  she is trying what she thinks she can do  at this moment but it's not clear how
UVob8FMT6Rk,25650878,25656400,long this injunction can stand  that's right that's exactly right uh the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25656400,25662798,timing here is unclear and you've got  this legal battle happening and you  mentioned it the political battle this
UVob8FMT6Rk,25662798,25669920,is absolutely going to be key uh in  november for both the governor and for  state lawmakers uh that are running
UVob8FMT6Rk,25669920,25675200,right now as well look it's it's so  critical to look at states like michigan  right now because you have red states
UVob8FMT6Rk,25675200,25680878,where they have those trigger laws  you've got blue states where governors  have worked to shore up abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,25680878,25686000,but then you have purple states like  michigan where you have a democratic  governor fighting to protect abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,25686000,25693280,rights and a republican state  legislature that is looking to roll back  abortion rights and in fact the governor
UVob8FMT6Rk,25693280,25700320,has filed a lawsuit with the supreme  court asking to invalidate that 1931 law
UVob8FMT6Rk,25700320,25706638,we don't know when they're going to come  out with a ruling on that but the  governor did today ask for the court to
UVob8FMT6Rk,25706638,25711760,expedite that case the republican state  legislature though has intervened in
UVob8FMT6Rk,25711760,25717200,that planned parenthood case you're  talking about to defend the 1931 law and
UVob8FMT6Rk,25717200,25722638,some lawmakers hallie have even proposed  a bill that would punish abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,25722638,25728000,providers with up to 10 years in prison  so you've got a major battle within
UVob8FMT6Rk,25728000,25734240,michigan's government right now and  meanwhile you have a lot of voters today  who are waking up in shock and i've
UVob8FMT6Rk,25734240,25740080,talked to democrats independents and  republicans about this today a lot of  people still really having a hard time
UVob8FMT6Rk,25740080,25745920,wrapping their mind around  having this right that has been in place  for most of their lifetimes taken away
UVob8FMT6Rk,25745920,25752478,here halle  governor whitmer as we mentioned is up  for re-election we all know michigan is  a key swing state okay it is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,25752478,25759280,fascinating when you look at it at the  broader political landscape in this  country blue versus red
UVob8FMT6Rk,25759280,25766558,she has concerns about what happens to  abortion access for women in her state  if she loses her re-election campaign
UVob8FMT6Rk,25766798,25773120,yeah i asked both whitmer about this  when we sat down earlier this week and i  asked the attorney general dana nessl
UVob8FMT6Rk,25773120,25778558,about this today during her press  briefing as well what are they going to  do as they're trying to protect abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,25778558,25784558,rights not just in this election cycle  but what happens in even if governor  whitmer does win in november what
UVob8FMT6Rk,25784558,25790320,happens two three four election cycles  from now uh what i heard from nestle  today is that they believe still that
UVob8FMT6Rk,25790320,25795840,the best avenue is uh on the ballot  there's a proposed ballot initiative
UVob8FMT6Rk,25795840,25801840,that would enshrine abortion rights in  michigan's constitution  that is something that abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,25801840,25807360,activists are trying to still get on the  ballot in november  and they believe that this is better
UVob8FMT6Rk,25807360,25812558,than with the courts because what we saw  today is that the supreme court you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,25812558,25819120,those rulings can be overturned hallie  you've been talking to people there  dasha you've been trying to see how
UVob8FMT6Rk,25819120,25824478,people are feeling today in the wake of  that supreme court decision tell us more  about that
UVob8FMT6Rk,25824798,25830080,yeah there are just shock waves uh  through  voters right now like i said across the
UVob8FMT6Rk,25830080,25835120,political spectrum you know in  washington when you look at the  political conversation it does seem
UVob8FMT6Rk,25835120,25840240,black and white or red or blue  rather but when i talk to women here
UVob8FMT6Rk,25840240,25846718,across the political spectrum there's a  lot more nuance a lot more gray area and  i want you to hear just a little bit of
UVob8FMT6Rk,25846718,25853200,my conversations today  how do they have the right  to tell me
UVob8FMT6Rk,25853200,25858478,or any woman  what she  can do with her body i'm concerned we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,25858478,25863760,starting to see the downfall of america  at this point and we're taking strong  words taking rights away from people is
UVob8FMT6Rk,25863760,25871440,a really big deal and how do we get  those rights back  [Music]  ali obviously a day with deeply personal
UVob8FMT6Rk,25871440,25876798,deeply emotional uh processes for people  to navigate what they've just heard i
UVob8FMT6Rk,25876798,25882638,also want to tell you pennsylvania  another state which is going to very  much have abortion front and center uh

UVob8FMT6Rk,25889840,25895280,trump twice uh voted for oz in the  primary and even she tells me that she
UVob8FMT6Rk,25895280,25901600,thinks the government shouldn't have a  say no matter federal or state in  personal medical decisions so it's not
UVob8FMT6Rk,25901600,25907360,as red or blue as some people may think  from from the conversations i've been  having today  dasha burns live for us in grand rapids

UVob8FMT6Rk,26126718,26131920,even after the ruling you are looking  live at that clinic now we had seen some  protests earlier there
UVob8FMT6Rk,26131920,26138718,where people were trying to keep folks  from going into the clinic it's going to  stay open until mississippi's trigger  law goes into effect sometime in early
UVob8FMT6Rk,26138718,26143760,july even as people there worry about  the future  today
UVob8FMT6Rk,26143760,26152478,across this country  half the population  were stripped of their human rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,26152478,26159600,um  it's hard to say this but that's just  the beginning
UVob8FMT6Rk,26159600,26164798,mississippi's governor was traveling  today with his daughter but took time to  praise today's decision in a quick video
UVob8FMT6Rk,26164798,26170958,on twitter  i've never been prouder  to be a mississippian
UVob8FMT6Rk,26170958,26176638,our elected officials were able to bring  this case  because of the conviction of our  constituents
UVob8FMT6Rk,26176638,26183840,you see mississippi is a god-fearing  place  and we fight this battle a battle who's
UVob8FMT6Rk,26183840,26190320,we've been fighting for almost 50 years  and we stand on the shoulders of so many  who have come before us but we fight
UVob8FMT6Rk,26190320,26196400,this battle because we believe in our  hearts that it's god's will  to do so
UVob8FMT6Rk,26196400,26203360,kathy park is in jackson mississippi for  us she's joining us now kathy this is  the clinic right the challenge the  mississippi abortion ban that said you
UVob8FMT6Rk,26203360,26208558,can't have abortions after roughly 15  weeks i thought it was interesting that  at one point earlier this afternoon you
UVob8FMT6Rk,26208558,26216396,said it's not like there were a ton of  demonstrators it's not like there were a  ton of protesters outside that clinic  today tell me what you're seeing now
UVob8FMT6Rk,26217040,26222558,ali yeah i was actually going to start  off with that point because despite what  you're seeing in washington d.c right
UVob8FMT6Rk,26222558,26228958,now this mobilization uh on both sides  of this debate we're right in front of  the capitol here in mississippi and it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,26228958,26235840,been relatively quiet all day and just a  few miles away from where we are  standing is uh that last standing
UVob8FMT6Rk,26235840,26241680,abortion clinic here in the state of  mississippi and it's been relatively  calm earlier today shortly after that  decision came out yes there were a
UVob8FMT6Rk,26241680,26246878,handful of protesters but i think  there's now more media than than  anything else um but you know what this
UVob8FMT6Rk,26246878,26252558,is a very restrictive state we're here  in the bible belt and a lot of people  that we spoke with on the ground tell me  look
UVob8FMT6Rk,26252558,26257920,after that leak in may  they kind of didn't ex you know they  actually said that this decision was not
UVob8FMT6Rk,26257920,26265280,a surprise to them they were kind of  anticipating this because the state is  so conservative there are so many  abortion restrictions already in place
UVob8FMT6Rk,26265280,26272160,obviously this has been a divisive issue  all across the board we had a chance to  speak with the owner of the clinic and
UVob8FMT6Rk,26272160,26278558,she said this is very disappointing it's  a reversal of women's rights however  their work will continue in fact they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,26278558,26284558,actually planning to open up another  clinic in the state of new mexico and  they're kind of working on that but ever
UVob8FMT6Rk,26284558,26291920,since this leak back in may they've been  mobilizing other resources getting other  organizations involved raising funds to
UVob8FMT6Rk,26291920,26297360,help women who want to still gain access  to abortion safely and legally beyond
UVob8FMT6Rk,26297360,26303760,the state of mississippi after that  10-day window hallie that was my  question to you kathy is what they plan  to do next kathy park live for us in
UVob8FMT6Rk,26303760,26309120,jackson thank you so much appreciate it  so tonight's original now with in-depth  reporting on a topic we've been keeping
UVob8FMT6Rk,26309120,26315520,an eye on which because of this supreme  court decision to overturn roe centers  on that news specifically on late-term
UVob8FMT6Rk,26315520,26322240,abortions a doctor who runs a clinic in  colorado which offers those types of  procedures says he expects to see a lot
UVob8FMT6Rk,26322240,26327360,more new patients with today's ruling  our own issa gutierrez was recently at  that clinic and also talked with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,26327360,26332478,former patient who turned to the  practice when she needed to have a late  term abortion herself
UVob8FMT6Rk,26332478,26339520,this layer here is bulletproof okay  nearly half a century ago dr warren  hearn worked at colorado's very first
UVob8FMT6Rk,26339520,26346240,abortion clinic  a controversial practice then and now  with the supreme court overturning their
UVob8FMT6Rk,26346240,26351920,landmark 1973 decision roe vs wade all  the windows around here are bulletproof
UVob8FMT6Rk,26351920,26357280,two years later he founded this place  the boulder abortion clinic in 1975. we
UVob8FMT6Rk,26357280,26363120,specialize in taking care of women who  have very high risk situations that  can't be seen in other clinics he's one
UVob8FMT6Rk,26363120,26368398,of a handful of doctors in the u.s who  perform late term abortions colorado one
UVob8FMT6Rk,26368398,26375920,of only a few states that does not  restrict them according to cdc data  abortions at or after 21 weeks represent
UVob8FMT6Rk,26375920,26381360,less than one percent of all abortions  in the u.s in 2019 they say more than 4
UVob8FMT6Rk,26381360,26386878,800 were performed last year a jump in  abortion restrictions enacted in 19
UVob8FMT6Rk,26386878,26394000,states with conservative legislators  arguing life begins at conception these  days dr hearn says abortion bans like
UVob8FMT6Rk,26394000,26399920,the ones in texas and oklahoma  restricting abortion after cardiac  activity at six weeks are making his
UVob8FMT6Rk,26399920,26405200,practice exceptionally busy the number  of patients we've seen has basically  doubled
UVob8FMT6Rk,26405200,26411680,since a year ago we can't possibly see  all the women who want to come here for  help and that i need to expand my
UVob8FMT6Rk,26411680,26418320,service he says the supreme court's  decision will push more women to have  late term abortions that increases the
UVob8FMT6Rk,26418320,26424798,cost it increases the complexity it  makes it more difficult takes more time  it's more emotional anguish erica
UVob8FMT6Rk,26424798,26431600,christensen a former patient of dr hearn  was in her third trimester when she says  her doctor explained her baby wasn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,26431600,26437760,swallowing there was a genetic muscular  condition that would not be conducive to
UVob8FMT6Rk,26437760,26444398,living outside my body she says they  decided to terminate the pregnancy  that's when we learned that we couldn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,26444398,26449440,in our state because we had crossed an  imaginary line that we didn't even know  existed
UVob8FMT6Rk,26449440,26456558,until that point we were sort of shocked  by that because we were living in new  york it was 2016 and at the time state
UVob8FMT6Rk,26456558,26464478,law banned abortions after 24 weeks she  was referred to dr hearn's clinic in  colorado it took two weeks for us under
UVob8FMT6Rk,26464478,26472558,the best possible circumstances to  figure out my course of care  ultimately she says she was lucky it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,26472558,26478240,poor people it's young people  it is disabled people medically complex
UVob8FMT6Rk,26478240,26484958,people like myself  it is people of color these are the  people who are going to be most impacted
UVob8FMT6Rk,26484958,26490160,by these bands  most people are just not as lucky as i
UVob8FMT6Rk,26490160,26496558,was  less than a year after visiting dr hearn  erica gave birth to a daughter my
UVob8FMT6Rk,26496558,26502798,five-year-old little girl literally  would not be here had i not been able to  have my abortion she's everything to us
UVob8FMT6Rk,26502798,26509600,like she's our whole lives do you think  about these laws changing and how  they'll impact her potentially one day
UVob8FMT6Rk,26509600,26516718,every day i think about what  life is going to be like for my  five-year-old little girl every day i
UVob8FMT6Rk,26516718,26522878,hope that by the time she's even  thinking about becoming pregnant i hope  things are better but certainly i mean
UVob8FMT6Rk,26522878,26529520,it's really scary times like i'm  absolutely terrified for her do you  already have plans for the new building
UVob8FMT6Rk,26529520,26535120,i'm working on it yeah yeah i'm  sketching out plans i'm working with the  architects i want us to be able to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,26535120,26541280,more patients dr hearn is turning 84  this month you're not going to retire no
UVob8FMT6Rk,26541280,26549440,i don't have time for that i'm bringing  another young physician to help me and  they're very dedicated and very skilled
UVob8FMT6Rk,26549440,26555440,issa gutierrez is joining us now issa it  is such timely reporting particularly  with what we're seeing in washington
UVob8FMT6Rk,26555440,26562878,today what stood out most to you as you  were talking with people forward against  late late-term abortions talking with  patients clinic staff etc
UVob8FMT6Rk,26562878,26569680,sure well hallie when we talk about  late-term abortions again these are  patients who are high-risk patients who
UVob8FMT6Rk,26569680,26576240,late in their pregnancies found out from  their doctors that they were  experiencing metal medical complications
UVob8FMT6Rk,26576240,26581280,that could put their life or their  baby's life at risk so hallie they are
UVob8FMT6Rk,26581280,26587040,not happy to be in this situation  they're also exhausted and they're angry
UVob8FMT6Rk,26587040,26592798,that they had to go to these lengths to  leave their state to find the means to  leave their states to come to a place
UVob8FMT6Rk,26592798,26598478,like dr hearn's clinic  to get the safe care that they needed  hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,26598478,26605040,the doctor you interviewed was showing  you the security setup that they have  there i was interested in that because  abortion has always been obviously it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,26605040,26611440,incredibly controversial it is deeply  personal for so many people in this  country are they anticipating
UVob8FMT6Rk,26611440,26616478,the potential for needing to shore up  for example that security apparatus isa
UVob8FMT6Rk,26616478,26622958,yeah well hallie dr hernan and the staff  explained to me that this has been  building for them really since they
UVob8FMT6Rk,26622958,26628478,opened in the last 50 years right those  bulletproof windows have been installed  now for years
UVob8FMT6Rk,26628478,26634080,they've increased the number of cameras  that they have dr hearn tells me he no  longer goes out his front door
UVob8FMT6Rk,26634080,26639600,they're of course concerned today more  than ever about their patients and about  their staff it makes it harder for them
UVob8FMT6Rk,26639600,26645200,to hire staff because working there is  so controversial  but i spoke to dr hearn just a little
UVob8FMT6Rk,26645200,26651360,bit ago on the phone and he told me that  who he's most scared for are the  patients who will not make it to his
UVob8FMT6Rk,26651360,26657040,clinic he's confident that they will be  able to protect the patients who get  there but those who don't those who
UVob8FMT6Rk,26657040,26662718,don't make it to him on time those are  the patients that he is most concerned  about right now
UVob8FMT6Rk,26662718,26668080,iso gutierrez thank you so much for  bringing us that story appreciate it  coming up the economic costs of ending

UVob8FMT6Rk,26821220,26831560,[Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,26834958,26840958,so we've talked about the personal and  the political impact of this decision by  the supreme court today to overturn the
UVob8FMT6Rk,26840958,26846478,landmark abortion rights ruling roe  versus wade but there is an economic  impact too
UVob8FMT6Rk,26846478,26851680,the american journal of public health  says research shows some women who are  denied abortions and then gave birth had
UVob8FMT6Rk,26851680,26858000,a better chance of being in poverty just  six months later and according to the  guttmacher institute an abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,26858000,26863120,advocacy group the two dozen states that  plan to ban abortions are more likely to  have a combination of higher
UVob8FMT6Rk,26863120,26868718,imprisonment rates lower wages fewer  worker rights and less access to quality  health care i want to bring in our j
UVob8FMT6Rk,26868718,26874240,cord now  and there's a lot of different  directions we could go in and talk about  the financial impact of restricting
UVob8FMT6Rk,26874240,26880638,abortion access  talk about some of the research that  shows what this ruling would do as it  relates to education for women
UVob8FMT6Rk,26880638,26886240,employment and how much money they could  end up burning  well hallie if the decision that we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,26886240,26891520,handed down today were based not on this  question of state rights versus federal
UVob8FMT6Rk,26891520,26898080,authority it would draw on evidence like  the evidence that's been collected here  in northern california a center of
UVob8FMT6Rk,26898080,26903520,public health research at ucsf the  university of california in san  francisco a research group led by diana
UVob8FMT6Rk,26903520,26910558,green foster did an enormous unique  study in the united states that looked  at the effect on more than a thousand
UVob8FMT6Rk,26910558,26916958,women of either being able to get the  abortion they sought or being denied the  abortion they sought and they found
UVob8FMT6Rk,26916958,26923600,enormous repercussions for those women  in almost every measure of their lives  in fact diana greene foster told me that
UVob8FMT6Rk,26923600,26929840,when you looked at the results you could  see that the women who'd been denied an  abortion were in effect predicting the
UVob8FMT6Rk,26929840,26937682,outcome in terms of the concerns they  had for themselves here's how she  described those findings
UVob8FMT6Rk,26937760,26943760,we find that women who are denied  abortions are more likely to be poor  people say it's not the right time and
UVob8FMT6Rk,26943760,26950478,we find that they're unable to achieve  other life aspirations when they're  denied an abortion they say i want to
UVob8FMT6Rk,26950478,26956478,take care of the children i already have  and we see that the existing children do  worse when their mom is denied an
UVob8FMT6Rk,26956478,26962958,abortion  by again every conceivable measure of  well-being halle we're looking at women
UVob8FMT6Rk,26962958,26968320,who are denied abortions in their place  of residence or place of work they are
UVob8FMT6Rk,26968320,26973360,absolutely wind up with worse outcomes  in life in category after category
UVob8FMT6Rk,26973360,26979360,hallie  there is the business impact here too  jake you are obviously a part of our  business and technology team here
UVob8FMT6Rk,26979360,26984878,covering this when you talk about the  economy you look at what companies are  doing you've got dick sported goods for
UVob8FMT6Rk,26984878,26990558,example dick's stock soared after the  company said that they would pay up to  four thousand dollars for people who
UVob8FMT6Rk,26990558,26997920,need to travel for legal abortions we  have seen this now  unfold at company after company talk us
UVob8FMT6Rk,26997920,27004558,through this and what that means  well not only are companies as of today
UVob8FMT6Rk,27004558,27009920,issuing statement after statement saying  that they will pay for out-of-pocket  travel expenses for any employees who
UVob8FMT6Rk,27009920,27016878,need to travel out of state for abortion  services meta for instance issued a  statement to that effect earlier you  mentioned dick's sporting goods but also
UVob8FMT6Rk,27016878,27023360,if you look at it you find that it is in  fact a big part of being able to recruit  women into a company more than 50
UVob8FMT6Rk,27023360,27030160,percent of cfos chief financial officers  surveyed by cnbc said that it would have  a big impact on whether they chose to
UVob8FMT6Rk,27030160,27036080,relocate somewhere based on what the  laws would be in that state and you also  have to look at the broader economic
UVob8FMT6Rk,27036080,27041920,impact the research shows that women who  do not have access to abortion or are  subject to state regulations that
UVob8FMT6Rk,27041920,27048240,restrict their access wind up unable to  take higher paying jobs they don't have  the flexibility in their lives so we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,27048240,27055200,going to see the ripple effects of this  go on and on in the states that choose  to restrict abortion choice hallie

UVob8FMT6Rk,27275680,27281440,in a key moment today on capitol hill  and honestly frankly what would have  otherwise if the supreme court hadn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,27281440,27286478,happened be the biggest story of the day  the new gun bill the most significant
UVob8FMT6Rk,27286478,27292638,federal gun legislation in decades is  now just one signature away from  becoming law that's because today you
UVob8FMT6Rk,27292638,27299040,see it on your screen the house of  representatives passed that bill that  already passed the senate with  bipartisan support you had 14 house
UVob8FMT6Rk,27299040,27305120,republicans voting yes with all house  democrats remember 15 republicans  supported this in the senate so now this
UVob8FMT6Rk,27305120,27310878,bill is on its way figuratively to  president biden's desk he's expected to  sign it fast i want to bring in now
UVob8FMT6Rk,27310878,27316478,julie sirkin and julie you know this is  a huge day i think in washington
UVob8FMT6Rk,27316478,27323440,mostly for what we saw from the supreme  court and this generational change to  roe versus wade the abortion decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,27323440,27329520,that has been overturned that we have  been talking about now for the last 60  minutes  if that hadn't happened
UVob8FMT6Rk,27329520,27335600,we'd probably for this hour have been  talking about what you are covering  today julie which is this significant
UVob8FMT6Rk,27335600,27342320,piece of legislation related to gun  reform in this country  15 republican senators voting yes and a
UVob8FMT6Rk,27342320,27349200,handful of republicans in the house  voting yes  yeah that's exactly right hallie when i  went to sleep yesterday after covering
UVob8FMT6Rk,27349200,27355600,the senate vote on the gun legislation i  can't tell you the emotion that i felt  in the chamber from gun control
UVob8FMT6Rk,27355600,27361520,advocates from shooting victims and from  senators themselves on both sides of the  aisle and today one of my colleagues ali
UVob8FMT6Rk,27361520,27366878,rafa spoke to madeline dean a democrat  from pennsylvania who said that she came
UVob8FMT6Rk,27366878,27373680,to the capitol today ready to vote on  this historic legislation and got the  notification on her phone that this
UVob8FMT6Rk,27373680,27380398,ruling came down from the supreme court  pennsylvania of course one of the states  in the country poised uh to restrict
UVob8FMT6Rk,27380398,27387840,abortions more than other states perhaps  really riding on the november election  something we've heard democrats say over
UVob8FMT6Rk,27387840,27393120,and over again today but that gun vote  man it's so historic passing the house
UVob8FMT6Rk,27393120,27399200,today and it just can't be overshadowed  even though the decision by roe of  course derailed some of that excitement
UVob8FMT6Rk,27399200,27405040,with democrats  so talk about what happens next they've  already sent it to the president's desk  right and i say figuratively because
UVob8FMT6Rk,27405040,27410718,it's not like there's some  you know  assembly line of people passing papers  over the president i mean there is
UVob8FMT6Rk,27410718,27417440,something physical that goes to to  president biden who's getting ready to  head on an overseas trip but we expect  him to sign it fast
UVob8FMT6Rk,27417440,27423680,well we don't know hallie because well  while nancy pelosi the speaker of the  house with a stroke of the pen sent that
UVob8FMT6Rk,27423680,27429520,legislation over to the white house  president biden could go on his trip and  come back next week and sign it then but
UVob8FMT6Rk,27429520,27436080,the bottom line here is this isn't  everything he wanted it's not everything  democratic leaders wanted they'll be the  first to say that it doesn't raise the
UVob8FMT6Rk,27436080,27441200,minimum age to 21. it doesn't ban  automatic weapons and it doesn't
UVob8FMT6Rk,27441200,27447040,enlist all universal background checks  either but it does a lot of things that  democrats have been pushing for over the
UVob8FMT6Rk,27447040,27453760,last three decades and with this  compromise this is something that gun  control advocates and shooting survivors
UVob8FMT6Rk,27453760,27459520,could be proud of as one woman told me  last night she said she thought she'd be  fighting for this for decades to come
UVob8FMT6Rk,27459520,27466080,she was a survivor of a mass shooting  herself in 2018 and she was just  speechless she never thought that this  would happen
UVob8FMT6Rk,27466080,27472958,julie sirkin live on the hill for us  julie thank you  as we talked about the supreme court's  decision to overturn roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,27472958,27478398,could have an impact for people who are  looking for abortions in florida the  republican-led state there has a ban on
UVob8FMT6Rk,27478398,27483680,abortions after 15 weeks that would go  into effect  later this week i think july 1st next
UVob8FMT6Rk,27483680,27489760,week i should say end of next week but  that's being challenged and right now  the state has one of the nation's  highest rates of abortion in the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,27489760,27495920,zinckle essenwa is with demonstrators in  st petersburg in florida for us and as  you walk with these protesters in clay
UVob8FMT6Rk,27495920,27501600,and i'm glad to see you out there  florida is an interesting place because  it it typically has been a place where
UVob8FMT6Rk,27501600,27507200,people let's say from georgia or alabama  have come seeking abortion access
UVob8FMT6Rk,27507920,27514320,that's a hundred percent right in some  ways people actually view florida as a  safe haven is that because they don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,27514320,27519680,have restrictive abortion rights no but  when you compare it to georgia to  louisiana
UVob8FMT6Rk,27519680,27525680,they have more access and so people are  really concerned we're here we're  marching cars are honking people are
UVob8FMT6Rk,27525680,27530798,saying my body my choice but it's also  the tale of two americas i was here
UVob8FMT6Rk,27530798,27536718,earlier today and there was a smaller  protest in favor of this scotus ruling  let's take a listen to what they had to
UVob8FMT6Rk,27536718,27543760,say  it's painful today yeah  it really hurts
UVob8FMT6Rk,27544160,27550080,i can't believe our country has gone  backwards the issue with abortion has  always been very simple for pro-lifers
UVob8FMT6Rk,27550080,27555840,and that is  one sentence it's not just your body  there's another person involved and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,27555840,27561680,that person is a  so halle a lot of different perspectives
UVob8FMT6Rk,27561680,27567040,but at the end of the day a lot of  heated emotion and the threat here  whether people are for or against
UVob8FMT6Rk,27567040,27573600,abortion was shocked even though they  had seen that draft opinion both sides  were very surprised to see the scotus
UVob8FMT6Rk,27573600,27579440,decision today hallie  tell me more about what you're hearing  from people there because this does as
UVob8FMT6Rk,27579440,27584878,you talk about has some specific impacts  on not just floridians but those who
UVob8FMT6Rk,27584878,27589920,have come into the state to try to  exceed access to abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,27590798,27596638,yeah hallie it has wide reaching impact  so republican governor ron desantis did
UVob8FMT6Rk,27596638,27602718,pass a 15-week abortion ban bill that  goes into effect july 1st it has been
UVob8FMT6Rk,27602718,27609600,contended right here in florida but now  a lot of the people who are marching  right now are concerned that that will
UVob8FMT6Rk,27609600,27615440,go into law without much contest because  of this scotus ruling and so overall the
UVob8FMT6Rk,27615440,27623200,sentiment is concerned but also tension  we witnessed a clash between  pro-abortion and anti-abortion advocates
UVob8FMT6Rk,27623200,27628878,let's take a listen at how that went  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,27628878,27632442,our parties
UVob8FMT6Rk,27635970,27642260,[Applause]  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,27642638,27650080,so hallie tensions are high online  offline folks are marching and this is  the first of what will be many protests
UVob8FMT6Rk,27650080,27657520,today but the other thread whether  people were for abortion or against  today was that the fight continues the
UVob8FMT6Rk,27657520,27663200,fight continues for both sides of this  issue so this is something we're going  to have to watch hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,27663200,27668240,zinckle essential right in the thick of  it there in st petersburg zinckley thank  you i want to bring in yamiche alcindor
UVob8FMT6Rk,27668240,27675120,our nbc news washington correspondent  moderator of washington week on pbs okay  um so yamiche
UVob8FMT6Rk,27675120,27681280,we've been doing this since 10 o'clock  this morning you and i since the supreme  court decision came down because it's  been a day of a lot of fast-moving
UVob8FMT6Rk,27681280,27686638,developments right not just the decision  but what we saw in some of those states  that have trigger laws what we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,27686638,27692160,looking at live right now in new york  city i believe this is washington square  park don't quote me on that we'll try to
UVob8FMT6Rk,27692160,27698478,find out as you are seeing people around  the country mobilize and activate and  you meet on both sides of this right
UVob8FMT6Rk,27698478,27704718,because you have abortion rights  advocates who are i think demoralized as  fair to say devastated is fair to say
UVob8FMT6Rk,27704718,27710718,you have anti-abortion advocates who are  celebrating who are now saying like what  we heard from former vice president mike
UVob8FMT6Rk,27710718,27717520,pence that the fight now is to try to  get every state to have similar  restrictions on abortion access
UVob8FMT6Rk,27717520,27722798,certainly and what you see from  conservatives really is a celebration  because this is a culmination of
UVob8FMT6Rk,27722798,27729600,conservatives and activism they've been  pushing for this for generations to have  roe v wade be overturned and democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,27729600,27735040,frankly now they are trying to  strategize how they are going to respond  to this president biden as well as house
UVob8FMT6Rk,27735040,27740638,speaker nancy pelosi they both said that  reproductive rights are on the ballot in  november making a pitch to voters that
UVob8FMT6Rk,27740638,27746000,democrats need to keep and then grow  their majorities in the house and the  senate we also hear already from some
UVob8FMT6Rk,27746000,27752558,senators that there's going to be a  hearing in the senate help committee  that's a committee that focuses on  health education and labor
UVob8FMT6Rk,27752558,27758160,they're going to be talking about what  the impact of this decision will be but  we should note that those senators
UVob8FMT6Rk,27758160,27764160,including senator patty murray she wrote  a letter among 20 senators who wrote a  letter to president biden asking for
UVob8FMT6Rk,27764160,27769200,executive action to protect abortion  rights in this country but the white  house has not really come up with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,27769200,27775040,strategy of how to really impact  abortion rights and maybe even make it  easier for a woman to get an abortion in
UVob8FMT6Rk,27775040,27780558,this country because of what the supreme  court has done and of course this issue  is now so much in the states hands and
UVob8FMT6Rk,27780558,27787200,we as we've been noting all day more  than half of the states in this country  are likely to or will ban abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,27787200,27792718,immediately and we're already seeing  women turned away from clinics so this  is a direct impact and politics and
UVob8FMT6Rk,27792718,27798320,politicians are trying to catch up with  women who are now having to find other  ways to get abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,27798320,27803600,we're taking a look now at some of these  aerial pictures from new york city  it was washington square park we were
UVob8FMT6Rk,27803600,27809680,looking at just a moment ago but you can  see i think the scale and the scope of  some of these demonstrations that we're  seeing it's not just here in washington
UVob8FMT6Rk,27809680,27815680,yamiche where we are outside the supreme  court it's also in cities around the  country and the issue has come up and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,27815680,27821280,know that you when you've talked with  folks about this issue one of the things  you hear about is how this will
UVob8FMT6Rk,27821280,27827120,disproportionately affect those in  marginalized communities lower income  women women of color people who would
UVob8FMT6Rk,27827120,27833920,potentially need to travel  hundreds of miles to obtain access to  abortion if they have the money to do so
UVob8FMT6Rk,27833920,27840718,they can get the time off work to do so  they have the ability to do so and they  have the support to do so that's a lot  of caveats
UVob8FMT6Rk,27840718,27845920,well it's very clear that the people in  this country who are accessing abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,27845920,27852080,are women who are low-income  disproportionately women of color um one  in four women in this country
UVob8FMT6Rk,27852080,27857120,under the age of 45 have had an abortion  but when i talk to advocates they tell
UVob8FMT6Rk,27857120,27863840,me that it is really the women of color  and women of low income who are going to  be suffering the most in some states
UVob8FMT6Rk,27863840,27869280,across the south in particular women are  going to have to drive upwards of 18  hours if they want to get an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,27869280,27876478,and i should also tell you i've been  interviewing  abortion  women who are  are running abortion clinics and they
UVob8FMT6Rk,27876478,27882160,tell me that once they get to those  abortion clinics let's say you go from  louisiana you drive the distance to get  to a place where you can't get an
UVob8FMT6Rk,27882160,27887360,abortion sometimes the waiting list  hallie are 300 women so it's not just
UVob8FMT6Rk,27887360,27893120,sort of getting yourself to another  state it's also can you afford the hotel  can you afford to take off work to wait
UVob8FMT6Rk,27893120,27898638,for that time so this is really going to  be expensive for a lot of women who  simply cannot afford it the other thing
UVob8FMT6Rk,27898638,27904798,to note here is that there are already  women especially shannon brewer who is  the director of the jackson women's
UVob8FMT6Rk,27904798,27910080,health organization that of course is  the is the clinic that was at the center  of the supreme court decision she told
UVob8FMT6Rk,27910080,27916478,me last month that she was already ready  to move to new mexico because she thinks  that women are going to need this and
UVob8FMT6Rk,27916478,27922160,that she is very very worried that this  is going to be devastating especially to  her clients who again are very low
UVob8FMT6Rk,27922160,27928320,income um so this is really you're  already seeing a lot of clinic directors  making decisions to try to make
UVob8FMT6Rk,27928320,27933520,immediate impact  because they're really worried for the  safety of women
UVob8FMT6Rk,27933520,27939200,yamiche alcindor it's so good to have  you with us thank you very much for that  analysis i appreciate it i want to leave  some of those pictures up that we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,27939200,27945600,seeing live from new york here as we  bring in our next guest carol lamb  because you had supreme court justice  clarence thomas
UVob8FMT6Rk,27945600,27954320,really raising eyebrows in democratic  circles today as they looked at the  impact beyond simply abortion access
UVob8FMT6Rk,27954320,27960878,in this supreme court ruling carol is  joining us now and carol you have the  justice saying that gay rights and  contraception's ruling should be
UVob8FMT6Rk,27960878,27965920,considered  now  by this court
UVob8FMT6Rk,27965920,27971440,that other rights based on substantive  due process need to be considered  griswold the right to birth control to
UVob8FMT6Rk,27971440,27977200,contraception lawrence which threw out  anti-sodomy laws obergefell which of  course legalized same-sex marriage now
UVob8FMT6Rk,27977200,27982638,justice alito came out you see justice  thomas's opinions here that we should  reconsider all of this right
UVob8FMT6Rk,27982638,27988160,you had justice alito in his decision  saying  well listen and i'm paraphrasing here
UVob8FMT6Rk,27988160,27994000,the dissent will say that we're going to  try to overturn other stuff we're trying  to be clear this is just about abortion  help us understand this right because
UVob8FMT6Rk,27994000,28000398,what justice thomas has written has  created i think some real ripple effects  politically here in washington and  beyond
UVob8FMT6Rk,28000398,28007120,sure howie what justice thomas wrote was  uh  way out on the edge here because as you
UVob8FMT6Rk,28007120,28013680,said justice alito took great pains to  say this this decision is limited to the  abortion context now
UVob8FMT6Rk,28013680,28018878,um you can question how much weight that  that actually carries because that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,28018878,28025200,not an uh that was not a statement that  is necessary to the outcome in this case  and when that happens when a justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,28025200,28031440,makes some comment that is not essential  to the holding of the case  it doesn't have any binding presidential
UVob8FMT6Rk,28031440,28038160,value but the judge the justice for all  it's worth and he did write the majority  opinion he said this is limited to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,28038160,28043840,abortion context  justice thomas in his concurring opinion  which means that he agrees with the
UVob8FMT6Rk,28043840,28050478,outcome in the in this case but he has  something else to say and the something  else he had to say was on the reasoning
UVob8FMT6Rk,28050478,28057200,of this opinion which he thinks is the  right reasoning absolutely  all of these other rights what today
UVob8FMT6Rk,28057200,28063920,stand as fundamental rights should be  revisited and there's no question the  way he would come out on those cases now
UVob8FMT6Rk,28063920,28071040,you can speculate about what happened  here uh justice alito's  initial draft opinion came out and you
UVob8FMT6Rk,28071040,28078160,can speculate that justice thomas tried  to get his view into the majority  opinion that did not happen so he's left
UVob8FMT6Rk,28078160,28084718,on his own writing this concurring  opinion but there is no question that he  is inviting another look at these
UVob8FMT6Rk,28084718,28091360,fundamental rights that you just laid  out so this is this was my question  carol this invitation right not just to
UVob8FMT6Rk,28091360,28097680,his fellow justices but  to conservative lawmakers and individual  states too no
UVob8FMT6Rk,28097680,28104398,absolutely that is the way that this  dobbs abortion opinion  ended up coming out in this case it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,28104398,28110398,very clear what the uh what the abortion  law was in terms of constitutional  protection for a woman to make a
UVob8FMT6Rk,28110398,28116000,decision in at least the early stages of  pregnancy  states passed laws that they knew
UVob8FMT6Rk,28116000,28121040,were not consistent with the supreme  court's holding in roe versus wade and
UVob8FMT6Rk,28121040,28127280,casey versus planned parenthood and they  did it intentionally to get this case in  front of the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,28127280,28132878,with a conservative majority and today  was the result of that and that is what  justice thomas
UVob8FMT6Rk,28132878,28140398,uh it's hard to see it any other way  that is what he is suggesting happen um  with these other fundamental rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,28140398,28147120,carol lamb it's good to see you thank  you so much for that analysis  thank you let's take a look now it's not  just the reverberations of the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,28147120,28152958,court decision having an impact here in  the united states there is international  reaction to this too and for that i want
UVob8FMT6Rk,28152958,28158958,to go to megan fitzgerald who is live  for us in london with more on how other  countries are looking at this ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,28158958,28165680,megan what are we seeing from the  international community i know that the  uk prime minister boris johnson is  calling this a big step backwards how is
UVob8FMT6Rk,28165680,28170958,this being seen around the world  yeah hallie i can tell you you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,28170958,28178240,those comments that you just mentioned  from prime minister johnson certainly  being echoed uh throughout europe and
UVob8FMT6Rk,28178240,28183840,across the world i mean keep in mind  we're talking just within the last  couple of years three years really that
UVob8FMT6Rk,28183840,28191360,we've seen several nations that are  predominantly catholic majority  christian nations voting to legalize
UVob8FMT6Rk,28191360,28198398,abortion that's  we're talking about  ireland along with argentina and mexico
UVob8FMT6Rk,28198398,28205280,so certainly as you mentioned across the  stage here we are seeing that this is  viewed as a step backwards for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,28205280,28211040,united states and so these global  leaders are sounding off you know we're  hearing from the prime minister of
UVob8FMT6Rk,28211040,28218398,belgium along with spain saying that  women should have the right to choose  the president of france emmanuel macron
UVob8FMT6Rk,28218398,28224478,saying that it is a fundamental right  for women to have an abortion and one  that should be protected the prime
UVob8FMT6Rk,28224478,28229840,minister of canada saying that this is a  horrific decision and that his heart and
UVob8FMT6Rk,28229840,28235760,and prayers are with the women and girls  in the united states and then lastly i  want to mention the first minister of
UVob8FMT6Rk,28235760,28241440,scotland saying that this is the darkest  day for women in her lifetime hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,28241440,28247600,what about the example that the u.s sets  for other countries because that is  something that we hear presidents past
UVob8FMT6Rk,28247600,28253440,and present tout often that the u.s is  an example to others in the world
UVob8FMT6Rk,28253440,28258638,when you talk to experts right um they  some of them suggest that places that
UVob8FMT6Rk,28258638,28266558,are looking to crack down on abortion  could use the us as an example in that  way what are the ripple effects here
UVob8FMT6Rk,28267040,28273440,yeah absolutely you know i mean and that  is the concern that there could  potentially be this ripple effect uh you
UVob8FMT6Rk,28273440,28278958,know we're hearing from the leader of  amnesty international the secretary  general uh who is saying that there is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,28278958,28285760,big concern that this is going to damage  the global perception of the united  states and then even worse
UVob8FMT6Rk,28285760,28291040,this could potentially influence  government and anti-rights organizations
UVob8FMT6Rk,28291040,28296958,to then further deny rights of women  across the world because as you  mentioned the united states is seen as a
UVob8FMT6Rk,28296958,28302320,role model for so many nations across  the world and so as the united states
UVob8FMT6Rk,28302320,28308878,does a lot of times we see that  reverberated across the world and so  there is real concern that this could
UVob8FMT6Rk,28308878,28313920,just be the start of rights for women  being denied across the world hallie
UVob8FMT6Rk,28313920,28321600,megan fitzgerald live for us in london  megan thank you for that when we come  back we'll take you to missouri which  has already banned abortion

UVob8FMT6Rk,28572718,28578398,with today's decision by the supreme  court overturning roe versus wade the  state of missouri became the first in
UVob8FMT6Rk,28578398,28584000,the country immediately after to  effectively end abortion because of its  trigger law that went into effect you
UVob8FMT6Rk,28584000,28589600,saw almost right away the state attorney  general's office there announcing that  he had signed the legal opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,28589600,28595440,implementing that abortion ban  i am humbled to be a part of this and
UVob8FMT6Rk,28595440,28601200,the first attorney general in the  country to effectively end abortion  as a long champion for the rights of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,28601200,28607040,unborn in missouri families i pledge to  continue to fight for our most  fundamental right
UVob8FMT6Rk,28607040,28612958,the right to life  democratic missouri congresswoman corey  bush stood outside the clinic where she
UVob8FMT6Rk,28612958,28618798,says she got an abortion after she was  raped saying she cannot believe today's  ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,28618798,28625360,it  broke my heart because i'm thinking  about the people who today found out
UVob8FMT6Rk,28625360,28631520,that they were pregnant who found out  they were pregnant a few weeks ago and  we're trying to figure out what to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,28631520,28637040,cal perry is in st louis he is joining  me now okay cal so you are in the state  that
UVob8FMT6Rk,28637040,28643120,immediately right we talk about a  trigger ban immediately pulled the  trigger on it and you heard eric schmidt  the attorney general in the state
UVob8FMT6Rk,28643120,28649600,touting that in that video  talk to me about what you've seen out  there and where this goes
UVob8FMT6Rk,28649600,28656080,yeah look it was like a political race  to to do that the republican governor  republican attorney general and a  republican state house
UVob8FMT6Rk,28656080,28661840,it needed to be codified they had to  actually sign a proclamation in order  for that trigger law to take effect and  so it was the attorney general who did
UVob8FMT6Rk,28661840,28667200,it first minutes later the governor did  it so again it was like the two were  trying to beat each other so immediately
UVob8FMT6Rk,28667200,28673200,you have  this ban it's now illegal to provide any  one woman with an abortion in this state
UVob8FMT6Rk,28673200,28678320,and that can carry 5 to 15 years in  prison for the medical provider that
UVob8FMT6Rk,28678320,28683600,went into immediate effect here this  location of planned parenthood as you  said this is the only location in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,28683600,28689040,state where women could get an abortion  before this morning a number of women  had appointments today had appointments
UVob8FMT6Rk,28689040,28695680,this weekend they're going to have to go  out of state from now they're going to  have to go to illinois is the closest  place they can go governor pritzker of
UVob8FMT6Rk,28695680,28702080,that state has said he is going to  protect a woman's right to have this  procedure  but here in missouri you know how we
UVob8FMT6Rk,28702080,28708320,talk about this a lot right planned  parenthood has said this is so about so  much more it's of course about abortion  rights but it's about more than that
UVob8FMT6Rk,28708320,28714240,it's about access to reproductive health  care for women and reproductive health  care they will tell you is health care
UVob8FMT6Rk,28714240,28720320,and in a place like missouri these  centers are vitally important because  you have a large population here that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,28720320,28726478,under the poverty level that needs the  protection of title 10 for example to  receive that health care and planned
UVob8FMT6Rk,28726478,28733200,parenthood and the groups here worry  including the protesters behind me worry  that the ruling today is going to have a  massive chilling effect that reaches far
UVob8FMT6Rk,28733200,28738240,beyond just abortion halley  when you talk to people what do you hear
UVob8FMT6Rk,28738240,28744798,right because you're in st louis which  is you know one of the obviously urban  centers it is it leans more democratic
UVob8FMT6Rk,28744798,28749920,than the rest of the state  yeah look i think people here are
UVob8FMT6Rk,28749920,28754958,shocked um even though they weren't  surprised that it was coming i know that  sounds weird that's sort of what planned
UVob8FMT6Rk,28754958,28761120,parenthood said right they were  expecting it but they're totally  speechless yeah look there's also a  depression that has set in here in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,28761120,28766398,place like missouri where people feel  helpless they feel like the state is run  by conservatives they feel like that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,28766398,28772080,not going to change and they feel like  conservatives are more aggressive than  liberals are then democrats are we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,28772080,28777920,hearing that a lot here right the way  that the supreme court shook out the way  that this ruling happened people here
UVob8FMT6Rk,28777920,28784160,are upset about it but the people we've  talked about i feel like there's nothing  they can really do about it and when you  look at this regionally this is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,28784160,28790798,regional story as well you look at  kansas for example well in 2020 kansas  did about 3 000 abortions and more than
UVob8FMT6Rk,28790798,28795920,half of them were women from missouri so  it was hard enough to get an abortion  here in missouri to begin with now it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,28795920,28801120,impossible and women here just they  don't know what it is they're going to  do
UVob8FMT6Rk,28801120,28807600,and i see i mean i see behind you cal  yelling honking all of that has it been  this active all day or has it built as
UVob8FMT6Rk,28807600,28812798,the day has gone on  this is picking up because  representative cory bush who you heard

UVob8FMT6Rk,29066558,29071600,historic supreme court decision ending  constitutional protections for abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,29071600,29079040,the high court's conservative majority  overturning roe v wade after nearly half  a century and in a six to three decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,29079040,29084398,the justices upholding a mississippi law  that bans almost all abortions after 15
UVob8FMT6Rk,29084398,29091760,weeks of pregnancy tonight celebratory  marches and growing protests in  washington as abortion rights go into
UVob8FMT6Rk,29091760,29096958,the hands of states with some bans on  the procedure already taking effect more
UVob8FMT6Rk,29096958,29103760,more barrett joins us now live from the  supreme court and mara you have been  there out out there all day what have
UVob8FMT6Rk,29103760,29110080,you been hearing  well gabe when i arrived at the supreme  court this morning around 9 00 a.m
UVob8FMT6Rk,29110080,29115760,tensions were already bubbling between  two groups of protesters those who  supported support abortion rights and
UVob8FMT6Rk,29115760,29123200,those who opposed them and then at the  time when this we were expecting to see  the supreme court decision come down  there was a brief hush among the crowd
UVob8FMT6Rk,29123200,29129440,before we learned that the supreme court  had overturned roe v wade and that group  that opposed the right to an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,29129440,29135760,absolutely erupted physically jumping up  and down cheering  several people i spoke with telling me
UVob8FMT6Rk,29135760,29142160,that this is something that they waited  so long for i spent the morning talking  with protesters across the board and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,29142160,29148240,want you to hear some of the  conversation from people who are very  excited that this decision came down  saying it was everything that they
UVob8FMT6Rk,29148240,29155122,worked for saying they wanted to make  abortion unthinkable illegal and  unnecessary
UVob8FMT6Rk,29157600,29164240,complete and utter joy that it was  finally overturned  personally i've had
UVob8FMT6Rk,29164240,29169840,people in my family have abortions and  they have felt the regret years and
UVob8FMT6Rk,29169840,29176160,years down the line and they're still  dealing and facing with the trauma today  all i know is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,29176160,29183280,every child deserves life  human rights happen human rights start  at conception and end at natural death
UVob8FMT6Rk,29183280,29187842,and that is what i'm going to fight for  until the day that i die
UVob8FMT6Rk,29189120,29195600,now we saw tears of joy from those that  end of the protesters but then  demonstrators who were here supporting
UVob8FMT6Rk,29195600,29202558,the right to an abortion were crying  tears of absolute despair i saw many  women walking around absolutely crying
UVob8FMT6Rk,29202558,29210398,and i spoke to several of them who said  that they feel an absolute loss and  despair here's some of our conversations
UVob8FMT6Rk,29210398,29216878,it feels like my country doesn't love me  and appreciate my body as a woman but  unfortunately people are going to die
UVob8FMT6Rk,29216878,29223760,women are going to die between now and  when we can get legislation passed  which is
UVob8FMT6Rk,29223760,29231120,untenable i was in high school in 1973  and i can say that
UVob8FMT6Rk,29231120,29237920,the stories were out there what happened  to women if they needed an abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,29239760,29244798,66 year old hannah there detailing how  frustrated it is for frustrating it is
UVob8FMT6Rk,29244798,29251440,for her to have seen roby passed and  then taken away that right taken away in  her lifetime she told stories hearing of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29251440,29257360,women when she was in high school with  knitting needles and clothes hangers  several of those graphic images we saw
UVob8FMT6Rk,29257360,29263680,depicted here on signs today and it's  that message that i've heard for months  covering this fight for abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,29263680,29269360,from people across the country that  they're saying that this doesn't  eliminate  the the right to an abortion it
UVob8FMT6Rk,29269360,29274398,eliminates the right to a safe abortion  gabe  so maura is so passionate on both sides
UVob8FMT6Rk,29274398,29280878,of this issue now i'm looking at those  peaceful demonstrators behind you but  we've also been hearing that security
UVob8FMT6Rk,29280878,29285920,has been beefed up not just at the  supreme court but also  at the capitol today what can you tell
UVob8FMT6Rk,29285920,29291080,us about that as the sun starts to go  down there
UVob8FMT6Rk,29291120,29296398,right there definitely was an increased  police presence ahead of the decision  coming down and a rotating group of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29296398,29303120,officers here throughout the day i'm  actually going to ask my photographer  rudy here to give you an elevated view  of this crowd because it has grown
UVob8FMT6Rk,29303120,29308398,specifically like  it is largely peaceful  there has been some verbal arguments but
UVob8FMT6Rk,29308398,29314958,also uh  level conversations between people on  both sides you can see just beyond
UVob8FMT6Rk,29314958,29320878,the protesters here that fence  surrounding the steps of the supreme  court to prevent people from getting any
UVob8FMT6Rk,29320878,29326878,closer and so there were security  precautions in place dc ramping up their  police presence throughout the weekend
UVob8FMT6Rk,29326878,29332160,we've been told and all of this though  as this group of thousands has escalated
UVob8FMT6Rk,29332160,29337920,throughout the day here it's important  to note that we sit in the shadow of  capitol hill president biden calling on
UVob8FMT6Rk,29337920,29344638,congress today after this decision uh  was overturned for congress to take  action to turn roe into federal law gabe
UVob8FMT6Rk,29344638,29350798,mark barrett out in front of the supreme  court live for us on top story mara  thanks so much  now as we mentioned previously the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29350798,29356718,supreme court issuing the decision  upholding a mississippi law that bans  abortion after 15 weeks the case
UVob8FMT6Rk,29356718,29363200,involving the jackson women's health  organization the state's only abortion  clinic which will now be forced to
UVob8FMT6Rk,29363200,29369520,shudder nbc's kathy park joins us now  live from outside the state capitol in  jackson and kathy what's been the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29369520,29376638,response to this decision in mississippi  so gabe uh when this decision came down
UVob8FMT6Rk,29376638,29382558,earlier today we were speaking with an  abortion rights advocate and she was  angered and disappointed and said this
UVob8FMT6Rk,29382558,29387680,was essentially a reversal of women's  rights meanwhile over at the abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,29387680,29392798,clinic you had pro-life advocates  outside pretty much all week long
UVob8FMT6Rk,29392798,29399840,waiting for this decision  and and they said this was a a good day  for them however the work isn't over um
UVob8FMT6Rk,29399840,29406558,they are trying to eliminate abortions  all across the board throughout the  nation so on both sides though what was
UVob8FMT6Rk,29406558,29412000,interesting gabe is that uh because of  this leak in may they kind of  anticipated this decision would go this
UVob8FMT6Rk,29412000,29419120,way so we're right in front of the state  capitol we didn't really see a lot of  activity or demonstrations like you're  seeing uh in front of the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,29419120,29424160,in d.c and over at the abortion clinic  uh yes there were a few protesters in  front of the clinic when this
UVob8FMT6Rk,29424160,29429200,announcement came out however throughout  the day today and we just checked in  with our colleagues over there right now
UVob8FMT6Rk,29429200,29434320,they said it's relatively calm and quiet  gabe  so kathy now the supreme court made its
UVob8FMT6Rk,29434320,29441760,decision based on a 2018 law passed by  mississippi's republican control  legislature but it's actually a 2007
UVob8FMT6Rk,29441760,29447680,trigger law that's going to end abortion  in almost all cases there within the  next few weeks so how exactly is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,29447680,29453040,going to work  yeah so mississippi is one of 13 trigger
UVob8FMT6Rk,29453040,29458638,loss states and here in mississippi  specifically essentially there is a  10-day window for the attorney general
UVob8FMT6Rk,29458638,29465920,to certify this decision from the  supreme court and lynn finch  put out a a statement earlier today via
UVob8FMT6Rk,29465920,29472878,twitter and she said that this was a  victory for women and a moment of women  empowerment and they plan on bolstering
UVob8FMT6Rk,29472878,29477920,adoption and and foster care resources  so based on that rhetoric she is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,29477920,29484398,staunch conservative it seems like this  will be official in a matter of days so  after that 10-day window
UVob8FMT6Rk,29484398,29489440,the last remaining abortion clinic which  is just a few miles away from here will  essentially have to close its doors gabe
UVob8FMT6Rk,29489440,29495360,kathy park live for us in mississippi  kathy thank you just hours after the  supreme court's decision president biden
UVob8FMT6Rk,29495360,29501520,called out conservative members of the  court and said abortion rights are on  the ballot this fall
UVob8FMT6Rk,29501520,29508320,make no mistake  this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades
UVob8FMT6Rk,29508320,29515040,to upset  the balance of our law  it's a realization of an extreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,29515040,29520958,ideology and a tragic error by the  supreme court in my view  the court has done what it has never
UVob8FMT6Rk,29520958,29527520,done before  expressly take away a constitutional  right  that is so fundamental
UVob8FMT6Rk,29527520,29533920,to so many americans that had already  been recognized  nbc news white house correspondent josh
UVob8FMT6Rk,29533920,29539680,letterman joins us now josh we'd known  this decision was coming for weeks now  but what was the scene like inside the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29539680,29544878,white house today  well gabe the white house officials that  i spoke with were somber but not
UVob8FMT6Rk,29544878,29550558,surprised as you pointed out people  expected widely that this was going to  be
UVob8FMT6Rk,29550558,29557520,the ruling after that leaked decision  seemed to suggest this was the way the  court was ready to go and so white house
UVob8FMT6Rk,29557520,29564240,officials you can see some of them a  group of all female white house aides  who watched president biden give those
UVob8FMT6Rk,29564240,29571680,remarks from the cross hall of the white  house today many of them have spent the  last many weeks preparing for this very
UVob8FMT6Rk,29571680,29578320,possibility and trying to figure out  what the administration would be able to  do in response to try to ensure access
UVob8FMT6Rk,29578320,29583600,to abortion for as many women as  possible the white house did say today
UVob8FMT6Rk,29583600,29589760,that they are focusing on ensuring the  ability of women to travel to other  states if they need to to get abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,29589760,29595120,as well as on  wide access to abortion medications but
UVob8FMT6Rk,29595120,29601920,the reality is this is something that  the president said he cannot simply sign  an executive order to restore a right
UVob8FMT6Rk,29601920,29608558,that the constitution uh the supreme  court said today is not part of the  constitution and that is one of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29608558,29614958,reasons that so many white house  officials really felt like today was a  major step backwards
UVob8FMT6Rk,29616798,29622160,for more on the congressional response  to this decision i want to bring in nbc  news capitol hill correspondent ali
UVob8FMT6Rk,29622160,29629360,vitale so aly what are you hearing from  both sides of the aisle right now  look it's as we expected democrats of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29629360,29636080,course furious republicans jubilant in  one case senator lindsey graham tweeting  that former vice president mike pence
UVob8FMT6Rk,29636080,29642160,called him today to thank him in his  words for his efforts in fighting for  conservative judges through the years
UVob8FMT6Rk,29642160,29648398,because of course that's how we got here  the fact that multiple of these justices  who voted to overturn roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,29648398,29654638,within this decision were appointed by  the trump administration and donald  trump himself republican senators seeing
UVob8FMT6Rk,29654638,29660240,the fruits of that labor there and then  of course democrats on their side  knowing this decision was coming but
UVob8FMT6Rk,29660240,29665520,many of them have told me today it  didn't make it any easier so ali what is  the democrats game plan here will they
UVob8FMT6Rk,29665520,29671520,actually force republicans to vote on  this issue or are they looking towards  the midterms as to where they might try
UVob8FMT6Rk,29671520,29676798,and move the needle here  gabe i don't anticipate votes because  the thing that they risk and this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,29676798,29682160,something that i've talked with many  sources about is they don't want to take  piecemeal votes here that allow certain
UVob8FMT6Rk,29682160,29688478,republicans to be on different sides of  this reproductive rights issue instead  they want to keep all of the focus on
UVob8FMT6Rk,29688478,29694000,november in the senate that's going to  mean doing things like hearings like  round tables and of course out in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29694000,29699760,rest of the country this is going to be  a key campaign trail issue states like  michigan where where gretchen whitmer
UVob8FMT6Rk,29699760,29705840,the governor there is up for reelection  she is staking a big claim to this issue  trying to be proactive in the courts in
UVob8FMT6Rk,29705840,29711920,her state before an old trigger law goes  into place there but again this is  something where the federal government
UVob8FMT6Rk,29711920,29717440,is pretty hamstrung so while senate  democrats and house democrats here are  angry they don't really have a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29717440,29722878,ways that they can channel that anger  except to tell voters to vote and you  can't talk about this decision and
UVob8FMT6Rk,29722878,29729440,without talking about the court itself  the way these justices are confirmed so  some senators are talking about that now
UVob8FMT6Rk,29729440,29736240,right  yeah that's exactly right we've heard  from senators like susan collins and joe  manchin who were key votes for some of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29736240,29742318,these now confirmed supreme court  justices saying in effect that they feel  duped by what they were told by these
UVob8FMT6Rk,29742318,29747840,judges in real time during their  confirmation hearings you'll remember  that people like gorsuch and kavanaugh
UVob8FMT6Rk,29747840,29753840,promised that roe versus wade was super  precedent or the law of the land  something that if they were confirmed to
UVob8FMT6Rk,29753840,29760160,the court they would agree not to touch  obviously we see now in the decision  today that's not true it has some
UVob8FMT6Rk,29760160,29766478,senators saying again that they feel  duped and others just questioning the  entire hearing process now
UVob8FMT6Rk,29766478,29772478,aly vitale on capitol hill ali thank you  so what does this mean for the future of  the republican party let's bring in
UVob8FMT6Rk,29772478,29779760,former republican congressman and nbc  news political analyst carlos cabello  carlos you know we heard ali that you
UVob8FMT6Rk,29779760,29784798,know we heard what she's hearing from  her sources on the hill but as a former  republican congressman what do you think
UVob8FMT6Rk,29784798,29791440,this means for the party and for the  midterms  so gabe republicans are going to use
UVob8FMT6Rk,29791440,29797440,this issue to try to motivate their  voters i know democrats are going to  capitalize on some anger among the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29797440,29803280,liberal baseball republicans are going  to go back to their voters and say this  is why it's important for you to come
UVob8FMT6Rk,29803280,29810080,out and support conservatives all across  the ballot for years we promised we  would be working on overturning roe v
UVob8FMT6Rk,29810080,29816160,wade and that day has finally come so  even though you can expect a lot of  energy from the democratic base
UVob8FMT6Rk,29816160,29822160,republicans are going to try to match  that energy and keep the momentum they  feel they have going into the midterms
UVob8FMT6Rk,29822160,29828958,and president trump has already claimed  this as a victory in a statement saying  that quote today's decision which is the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29828958,29834240,which is the biggest win he says for  life in a generation  along with other decisions that have
UVob8FMT6Rk,29834240,29840398,been announced recently were only made  possible because i delivered everything  as promised so
UVob8FMT6Rk,29840398,29846478,carlos how do you think this decision  impacts trump's legacy and his political  future
UVob8FMT6Rk,29846478,29852318,well this is probably part of  donald trump's  early campaign to return to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,29852318,29858958,presidency a lot of republicans most  still assume that donald trump is going  to run for president and of course on a
UVob8FMT6Rk,29858958,29866240,day like this on an issue he knows is so  dear to the republican base he's out  there taking credit and to be fair he
UVob8FMT6Rk,29866240,29872318,did appoint three justices who all voted  for this decision so uh this this could
UVob8FMT6Rk,29872318,29878398,be the uh the uh the beginning of donald  trump's campaign for the presidency yeah  he promised those three conservative
UVob8FMT6Rk,29878398,29883920,justices and he did deliver  moving forward and you touch on this a  little bit uh in your first answer but
UVob8FMT6Rk,29883920,29888958,do you think this decision will impact  how republicans campaign when it comes  to the issue of abortion specifically
UVob8FMT6Rk,29888958,29895040,though in the states where abortion will  essentially be illegal  well where this is really going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,29895040,29900558,challenge republicans gabe is in  suburban america republicans lost
UVob8FMT6Rk,29900558,29906398,suburban america in 2018.  that's what  ended their house majority
UVob8FMT6Rk,29906398,29912638,and uh  ultimately defeated donald trump in 2020  republicans right now are gaining ground
UVob8FMT6Rk,29912638,29918000,with that suburban base they're  recovering some of those voters but in  those districts it can be tricky for
UVob8FMT6Rk,29918000,29924718,some republicans because there are a lot  of suburban women who although they  support some abortion restrictions also
UVob8FMT6Rk,29924718,29929920,do support roe v wade or the right  constitutional right to an abortion so
UVob8FMT6Rk,29929920,29936798,the republicans in the swing districts i  think are the ones that are going to  have the most trouble  face the most headwinds as a result of
UVob8FMT6Rk,29936798,29942318,this decision former congressman carlos  cabello and  nbc news political analyst thank you so
UVob8FMT6Rk,29942318,29949600,much for joining us now we want to show  you some live pictures right now of  demonstrators outside washington square
UVob8FMT6Rk,29949600,29956240,park uh here in new york city you see a  growing crowd there gathering as the sun  begin begins to come down on the east
UVob8FMT6Rk,29956240,29961840,coast certainly part of the growing  passions that we're seeing on both sides  of this issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,29961840,29967200,here across the country and we want to  turn now to michigan though one of the  states teetering on the edge of a near
UVob8FMT6Rk,29967200,29972638,total ban on abortion a 1931 law that  criminalizes abortion with no exceptions
UVob8FMT6Rk,29972638,29977920,for rape or instance has been  temporarily blocked but that could  change at any moment
UVob8FMT6Rk,29977920,29984240,nbc's dasha burns is on the ground for  us in grand rapids and dasha that highly  restrictive abortion law is not
UVob8FMT6Rk,29984240,29990478,currently in effect because of a lawsuit  filed by planned parenthood but where  does that case stand now and how likely
UVob8FMT6Rk,29990478,29995680,is it to last  yeah those are all important questions
UVob8FMT6Rk,29995680,30000798,and questions that are frankly still up  in the air here it's not clear how long  that injunction
UVob8FMT6Rk,30000798,30007360,will remain in place and look gabe this  is a law that was dormant that was  largely irrelevant after roe took effect
UVob8FMT6Rk,30007360,30012958,and is now going to become central in a  battle over abortion here and that's  battle's going to be fought on multiple
UVob8FMT6Rk,30012958,30020000,fronts by the way in the courts and also  at the ballot box in november we've got  a critical election coming up here now
UVob8FMT6Rk,30020000,30026080,governor whitmer has filed a lawsuit to  try to invalidate that 1931 law that
UVob8FMT6Rk,30026080,30031360,bans abortion tried to get the supreme  court to say that it's unconstitutional
UVob8FMT6Rk,30031360,30037840,but she's got a republican state  legislature here that is pushing to  defend that law so it's going to be so
UVob8FMT6Rk,30037840,30044718,important to watch this purple  statescape where you're going to see a  real push and pull between both parties
UVob8FMT6Rk,30044718,30050638,here it's going to be a really tense  process over the next few months leading  up to those november midterms and dasha
UVob8FMT6Rk,30050638,30056478,you've been talking to women in grand  rapids all day what's the mood like  there on the ground
UVob8FMT6Rk,30057280,30063520,shock for women by the way across the  political spectrum kent county is a  purple county in a purple state this is
UVob8FMT6Rk,30063520,30070160,sort of a bastion of moderate moderate  republicanism and several of the  moderate republican women i've spoken
UVob8FMT6Rk,30070160,30076718,with say they feel like this is the gop  heading in a direction that they did not  expect they did not see coming over
UVob8FMT6Rk,30076718,30083520,their years uh voting for candidates in  the party and they think this is going  to affect the midterms but overall
UVob8FMT6Rk,30083520,30090798,there's just been so much emotion today  as people are processing this historic  moment on a very deep personal level
UVob8FMT6Rk,30090798,30097600,take a listen to just some of what we  heard today  i was 18 when roe versus wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,30097600,30104080,went into effect and it was like  it was a gift i felt like my government
UVob8FMT6Rk,30104080,30109360,understood that i was a human being that  could make up my own mind how do they  have the right
UVob8FMT6Rk,30109360,30116000,to tell me  or any woman  what she  can do with her body and i do have a
UVob8FMT6Rk,30116000,30121440,problem with them now coming out and  saying that women no longer have choice  in their health care matters and that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,30121440,30127360,concerning to me not just you know for  people you know  my age but also for
UVob8FMT6Rk,30127360,30133760,there's you know kids coming up the next  generation my nieces my my sons and  their their future spouses you know what
UVob8FMT6Rk,30133760,30140080,does this mean for future generations  now the governor has asked the michigan
UVob8FMT6Rk,30140080,30147680,supreme court to expedite this case so  hopefully we'll have some sort of  answers uh soon but the timeline and
UVob8FMT6Rk,30147680,30153360,what those answers will look like and  what that will mean for other cases  going forward still unclear gabe dasha
UVob8FMT6Rk,30153360,30159680,burns live for us in michigan dasha  thank you now to another state in the  midwest missouri today one of more than
UVob8FMT6Rk,30159680,30164958,a dozen states activating its so-called  trigger law after the supreme court's  decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,30164958,30170080,nbc's cal perry joins us now live from  outside planned parenthood in st louis
UVob8FMT6Rk,30170080,30175920,and cal i've been watching reporting all  day and you're standing outside of what  was the last clinic in missouri to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,30175920,30181840,performing abortions how is the state's  trigger law playing out there
UVob8FMT6Rk,30181840,30188000,no that's right gabe the last and the  only place that women could receive an  abortion in this state and of course now
UVob8FMT6Rk,30188000,30193600,that is illegal it was only about 10  minutes after the dobbs ruling came out  of washington dc when we heard the
UVob8FMT6Rk,30193600,30200958,attorney general here codify that ruling  he signed a proclamation it was the only  thing that he had to do to activate that
UVob8FMT6Rk,30200958,30207840,trigger law that trigger law was passed  by the state legislature in 2019 and  simply put all that it said was once roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,30207840,30212958,v wade is overturned if roe v wade is  overturned that abortion would  immediately become illegal in the state
UVob8FMT6Rk,30212958,30218160,of missouri no exceptions for incest or  or for for rape here in the state the
UVob8FMT6Rk,30218160,30223760,bottom line is for women in this state  and for the health care providers who  want to provide an abortion it could
UVob8FMT6Rk,30223760,30230240,cost them 5 to 15 years in prison right  now local officials here want to make it  clear that if you had an appointment for
UVob8FMT6Rk,30230240,30235440,example at this location today or this  weekend you can still go to illinois  governor pritchard in illinois has said
UVob8FMT6Rk,30235440,30241440,he'll make it a priority to protect  women's rights to have an abortion in  that state but here in missouri it is  now illegal and look this is also a
UVob8FMT6Rk,30241440,30248398,regional issue gabe if you look at  kansas kansas is going to have a vote in  august why is that important here in  missouri well about half the abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,30248398,30254318,that take place in kansas are for women  from missouri so it is a regional issue  as well so i hear those demonstrators in
UVob8FMT6Rk,30254318,30261120,the background there cal would you say  the crowd is growing at this point has  it been diminishing throughout the day
UVob8FMT6Rk,30261120,30266478,yeah it is growing this is going to be  an event held by representative bush who  has a very personal story about this
UVob8FMT6Rk,30266478,30272240,location i spoke to her earlier take a  listen  i'm standing at the place where i had my
UVob8FMT6Rk,30272240,30279040,own  abortion care services at 18 years old i  got raped when i was 17. it
UVob8FMT6Rk,30279040,30284398,broke my heart because i'm thinking  about the people who today found out
UVob8FMT6Rk,30284398,30290318,that they were pregnant who found out  they were pregnant a few weeks ago and  we're trying to figure out what to do  people it
UVob8FMT6Rk,30290318,30296240,it takes more than a minute to make a  decision about what you're going to do  that will affect your life
UVob8FMT6Rk,30296240,30302160,for years to come and affect the life of  another human being it's not something  that people can automatically just make
UVob8FMT6Rk,30302160,30308240,a decision in a matter of weeks or a  matter of a couple days or a few hours  sometimes it takes time and we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,30308240,30314398,stripping that for people  and so representative bush has organized
UVob8FMT6Rk,30314398,30320958,this rally that you see forming behind  me gabe and there will be events we  understand throughout the weekend here  in st louis cal perry live for us in

UVob8FMT6Rk,30527840,30534160,providing abortions in 10 days before  today's ruling that facility was  supported almost entirely by doctors
UVob8FMT6Rk,30534160,30539360,from out of state with few local doctors  willing to brave the stigma surrounding
UVob8FMT6Rk,30539360,30544440,abortion one of those out-of-state  providers is dr cheryl hamlin who's a
UVob8FMT6Rk,30544440,30549680,massachusetts-based physician and dr  hamlin thanks so much for joining us  here on top story tonight so for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,30549680,30554958,last five years you've made monthly  trips to jackson women's health to  provide abortion care to the patients
UVob8FMT6Rk,30554958,30560240,there what is your reaction tonight to  the supreme court's decision knowing  you're not going to be able to make that
UVob8FMT6Rk,30560240,30565280,trip next month  yeah i mean it's not a surprise
UVob8FMT6Rk,30565280,30570798,certainly but um nonetheless it's pretty  devastating  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,30570798,30576318,yeah i  i guess i was holding out hope till the  very end but but here we are
UVob8FMT6Rk,30576318,30581520,so have you had a chance to speak with  patients in mississippi how are they  reacting to this and where will they
UVob8FMT6Rk,30581520,30589040,turn now  i've not had a chance to speak with any  women in mississippi but um
UVob8FMT6Rk,30589040,30594318,yeah they don't have a lot of options  because as i think was said before that
UVob8FMT6Rk,30594318,30601520,all the surrounding states are um  going to be  you know banning abortions as well so
UVob8FMT6Rk,30601520,30607760,we're going to be talking about  you know illinois and massachusetts and
UVob8FMT6Rk,30607760,30614160,and new mexico and colorado i mean those  are those are going to be their their  options going forward yeah so picking up
UVob8FMT6Rk,30614160,30619280,on that point if women are forced to go  out of state to places like  massachusetts where abortions remain
UVob8FMT6Rk,30619280,30625120,legal are those states equipped to deal  with an influx of new patients
UVob8FMT6Rk,30625280,30630558,um  yeah i mean i think some of the states  that will be hardest it might be like
UVob8FMT6Rk,30630558,30635840,illinois and i i'm not sure what they're  doing we are kind of gearing up in new
UVob8FMT6Rk,30635840,30642080,mexico and massachusetts i can speak for  that but um  it's going to be a lot i mean i don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,30642080,30648958,think we know how many and that's  unfortunately for those women who can  actually make the trip and make it um
UVob8FMT6Rk,30648958,30654638,you know make it to those states which  is not everybody you know as a doctor  are you worried that this decision might
UVob8FMT6Rk,30654638,30660558,force women to make unsafe choices about  their reproductive health  absolutely um
UVob8FMT6Rk,30660558,30665760,and you know either from  um self-induced abortions um you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,30665760,30672240,and maybe you know people say well it's  a little safer now because um you know  of the pills but at the same time states
UVob8FMT6Rk,30672240,30678798,are going to make it really hard to do  that safely so um  you know i'm sure there will be that i
UVob8FMT6Rk,30678798,30683920,i'm also concerned that um  you know the women who do make it out of
UVob8FMT6Rk,30683920,30689520,the state but go back are going to be  afraid to seek medical care if they have  any issues
UVob8FMT6Rk,30689520,30695200,which which did happen pre-roll we know  that  um  you know they just don't get care until

UVob8FMT6Rk,30992878,30998638,let's get right to pete williams who  leads us off from washington  outside the court now ringed with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,30998638,31005440,security fence opponents of abortion  rights cheered complete and utter joy  that was finally overturned but the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31005440,31012200,determination of steely determination  that the battle is not over
UVob8FMT6Rk,31014398,31019840,for others it was what they were  dreading ever since the court signaled  in december it was likely to overturn
UVob8FMT6Rk,31019840,31026798,roe it feels like a betrayal it feels  like my country doesn't love me  and appreciate my body as a woman the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31026798,31033120,court overturned nearly 50 years of  abortion precedence and a ruling that  was a first never before has the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,31033120,31040398,granted and then taken away a widely  recognized constitutional right  the court voted five to four to overturn
UVob8FMT6Rk,31040398,31046318,roe chief justice john roberts said  going that far wasn't necessary to  uphold mississippi's law banning
UVob8FMT6Rk,31046318,31053920,abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy the  court voted six to three to uphold that  law the majority opinion overturning roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,31053920,31060160,tracked closely with the version that  leaked in may touching off nationwide  protests including at the homes of some
UVob8FMT6Rk,31060160,31067440,of the court's conservatives justice  samuel alito's majority opinion said no  right to abortion is protected by any
UVob8FMT6Rk,31067440,31074160,constitutional provision the road  decision he said was egregiously wrong  and deeply damaging like winston
UVob8FMT6Rk,31074160,31079760,churchill said this is the end of the  beginning  it's been a 50-year battle to protect
UVob8FMT6Rk,31079760,31085520,unborn children  but we now have those battles in every  state unlike other court rulings based
UVob8FMT6Rk,31085520,31092000,on a right to privacy alito said  abortion is different because it  involves a potential life so he said the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31092000,31097840,ruling does not undermine the rights to  same-sex marriage or contraception  though justice clarence thomas said the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31097840,31104080,court should take another look at them  too  the ruling does not make abortion  illegal but it's no longer a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31104080,31110558,constitutional right so that leaves the  issue up to each state it's likely to  become illegal soon in about half the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31110558,31116558,nation some states have already banned  it as of tonight the rest of the banned  states are likely to follow in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31116558,31123760,coming weeks justice brett kavanaugh in  a controlling concurrence said states  that ban abortion cannot make it a crime
UVob8FMT6Rk,31123760,31129840,for their residents to travel to a state  where abortion is legal to get the  procedure in a joint descent justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,31129840,31136558,stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena  kagan said the court ruling means that  from the very moment of fertilization a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31136558,31143120,woman has no rights to speak of they say  a state can force her to bring a  pregnancy to term even at the steepest
UVob8FMT6Rk,31143120,31149520,personal and family cost people are  going to be heading to the streets both  in the wake of this decision immediately
UVob8FMT6Rk,31149520,31155920,and in the days and months to come and  making clear that the majority of people  united states support abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,31155920,31162240,and pete williams joins us now live from  washington  pete i want to pick up on something in  your report you mentioned that justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,31162240,31168398,kavanaugh seemed to indicate that he  supports the constitutional right to  travel to other states to get an
UVob8FMT6Rk,31168398,31175600,abortion can you talk to me more about  that how different was that from his  other conservative colleagues
UVob8FMT6Rk,31176080,31182398,well he's the only one who said that and  normally you would say that was just a  passing comment but this is a five to
UVob8FMT6Rk,31182398,31189440,four ruling to uphold roe so his vote  was critical that makes it the  controlling decision so when he says he
UVob8FMT6Rk,31189440,31194638,believes there's a constitutional right  to travel i think that's as good as  saying the supreme court has said that
UVob8FMT6Rk,31194638,31200878,as well now pete you have been standing  outside that supreme court building for  decades and you see the demonstrators
UVob8FMT6Rk,31200878,31207520,behind you when you  heard this decision come down this  morning just put in perspective for me
UVob8FMT6Rk,31207520,31212958,how seismic was this decision in the  history of the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,31213280,31219680,well as expected it was seismic because  of the historical nature of it  overturning a 50-year precedent the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31219680,31225600,first time the court has ever given us a  right and then taken away that it's  constant that's widely accepted you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,31225600,31230958,in a way we knew this day was coming uh  it was pretty clear when the case was  argued back in december the court was
UVob8FMT6Rk,31230958,31237200,going to overturn roe then we had that  leaked version of the decision that came  out in february but still it's still
UVob8FMT6Rk,31237200,31242798,stunning when it actually happens and  this is the biggest crowd i've ever seen  outside the supreme court after a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31242798,31249760,decision people celebrating and mourning  the decision and one other note here  gabe this now does return the issue to
UVob8FMT6Rk,31249760,31256000,the states but one thing the dissenters  say today is that there's nothing in  this ruling that would prevent congress
UVob8FMT6Rk,31256000,31262558,from banning abortion nationwide if it  ever chose to do that peter williams  live for us at the supreme court pete
UVob8FMT6Rk,31262558,31269120,thanks so much  reaction is pouring in from across the  country as the supreme court's decision  was handed down tears of elation and
UVob8FMT6Rk,31269120,31275760,frustration from protesters on either  side of this issue and as crowds took to  the streets trigger laws immediately
UVob8FMT6Rk,31275760,31280958,took effect in several states some women  suddenly unable to get abortions it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,31280958,31286478,scheduled for today  nbc's blaine alexander is in mississippi
UVob8FMT6Rk,31286478,31292958,outside the mississippi clinic at the  heart of today's supreme court decision  we do abortion and we're proud to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,31292958,31299120,abortion even though the days for that  are now numbered at the jackson women's  health organization the requests are
UVob8FMT6Rk,31299120,31305600,only growing in 10 days because of the  state's trigger law mississippi's only  abortion clinic will shut down for good
UVob8FMT6Rk,31305600,31311120,i will tell you that any patient that  contacts us we'll see them  we'll make sure we see them during that
UVob8FMT6Rk,31311120,31318160,10 days but in some states change is  already happening of the 13 trigger loss  states abortion is now illegal with a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31318160,31325200,few exceptions in at least five of them  following today's ruling including  missouri oklahoma and arkansas
UVob8FMT6Rk,31325200,31332080,where through tears the attorney general  signed the certification late today  restoring to the state of arkansas the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31332080,31338798,authority to prohibit abortion  in wisconsin planned parenthood  immediately stopped abortions following
UVob8FMT6Rk,31338798,31345840,today's ruling the medical director had  to break the news to patients already in  the waiting room today i had to look
UVob8FMT6Rk,31345840,31352000,people in the eye and turn them away  when they were seeking abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,31352000,31357040,across the country emotional reaction on  both sides my first reaction was rage
UVob8FMT6Rk,31357040,31363040,this is an amazing victory and while  some lawmakers celebrate the decision  this is a profound
UVob8FMT6Rk,31363040,31368638,change in the law in our country and it  will save millions of lives of unborn
UVob8FMT6Rk,31368638,31375600,children others my wife's in tears  my kids are  incredibly distraught
UVob8FMT6Rk,31375600,31382718,my sister  says i thought the courts were there to  protect our freedoms not roll them back
UVob8FMT6Rk,31382718,31390080,back in mississippi today's ruling is a  victory for terry herring my eyes just  filled with tears this is a day to
UVob8FMT6Rk,31390080,31396638,rejoice she has spent nearly 30 years  fighting to end abortion and says she's  proud mississippi played a role what
UVob8FMT6Rk,31396638,31401760,does today mean for you  you know personally
UVob8FMT6Rk,31401760,31407280,you know we didn't know if this would  happen in our lifetime right we we've  been advocating for a long time so
UVob8FMT6Rk,31407280,31413600,seeing this happen in my lifetime and  knowing that we have the opportunity to  be a part of that  is
UVob8FMT6Rk,31413600,31420000,it means us being a part of changing  history but for tyler hardin who runs  planned parenthood in the state you've
UVob8FMT6Rk,31420000,31427360,gotten dozens of calls since this  decision came down are women scared  yes and to be honest i'm scared as well
UVob8FMT6Rk,31427360,31434558,the closest clinic she says will be in  florida a seven hour drive that means  that people will have to find funds to
UVob8FMT6Rk,31434558,31439760,travel people will have to find funds to  get hotel rooms buy food is that a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31439760,31446080,feasible option for them it's not  blaine alexander joins us now live from  jackson mississippi and blaine you
UVob8FMT6Rk,31446080,31451360,touched on this at the end of your  report but travel is particularly  difficult for many women in mississippi
UVob8FMT6Rk,31451360,31458000,how huge of a hurdle is that going to be  with this statewide abortion ban already  taking effect
UVob8FMT6Rk,31458160,31463520,you know gabe for many people it will be  an insurmountable insurmountable hurdle  consider this mississippi has the
UVob8FMT6Rk,31463520,31469760,highest poverty rate of any state in the  nation it's a number that's especially  high among black women a group that many
UVob8FMT6Rk,31469760,31475840,fear will be most impacted by today's  decision now in talking with activists  on both sides of this one place where
UVob8FMT6Rk,31475840,31482160,they do agree they say that the focus  should be on getting women the resources  that they need for a safe pregnancy and
UVob8FMT6Rk,31482160,31488478,beyond gabe blaine alexander live for us  in mississippi blaine thank you  president biden condemned today's
UVob8FMT6Rk,31488478,31494798,decision declaring that roe will be on  the ballot in this fall's midterm  elections while conservative republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,31494798,31500878,applauded the ruling peter alexander has  more from the white house  a somber president vine tonight
UVob8FMT6Rk,31500878,31507760,declaring this a low moment for the  nation's highest court it's a sad day  for the court and for the country
UVob8FMT6Rk,31507760,31514000,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,31514000,31519920,nation  are now at risk the white house mindful  of how personal this ruling is inviting
UVob8FMT6Rk,31519920,31526000,more than a dozen senior aides all women  to witness the president calling the  decision the result of an extreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,31526000,31531760,ideology it was three justices named by  one president  donald trump
UVob8FMT6Rk,31531760,31538558,make no mistake  this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades
UVob8FMT6Rk,31538558,31545360,to upset  balance of our law  top republicans touting the ruling as a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31545360,31551680,hard-won victory the right to life has  been vindicated  the voiceless
UVob8FMT6Rk,31551680,31558638,will finally have a voice  it will save countless innocent children  two prominent senators now suggest they
UVob8FMT6Rk,31558638,31565280,were misled by assurances made during  recent confirmation hearings roe v wade  is an important president of the supreme
UVob8FMT6Rk,31565280,31571520,court a good judge will consider it as  precedent of the united states supreme  court republican susan collins slamming
UVob8FMT6Rk,31571520,31576558,today's decision as inconsistent with  those justice's testimony so what comes
UVob8FMT6Rk,31576558,31583120,next with his authority limited tonight  president biden's calling on congress to  guarantee the right to an abortion but
UVob8FMT6Rk,31583120,31589200,senate democrats currently do not have  the votes for that the president vowing  his administration will protect women's
UVob8FMT6Rk,31589200,31594318,access to fda approved medications like  abortion pills and contraception and
UVob8FMT6Rk,31594318,31601840,promising to defend a woman's ability to  travel to other states where abortion  remains legal 63 percent of americans do
UVob8FMT6Rk,31601840,31608398,not believe rose should be overturned  democrats including the nation's first  woman vice president hoping to redirect
UVob8FMT6Rk,31608398,31615000,that outrage to this fall's midterm  elections you have the final word
UVob8FMT6Rk,31615120,31621600,so this is not over this fall roe is on  the ballot a defining cultural clash in
UVob8FMT6Rk,31621600,31626798,a country now even more deeply divided  and peter alexander joins us now live
UVob8FMT6Rk,31626798,31633200,from the white house peter president  biden is also warning that the court's  ruling could lead to other personal  freedoms being rolled back yeah gabe
UVob8FMT6Rk,31633200,31639600,that's right president biden cited  justice thomas's majority opinion that  the right to contraception same-sex
UVob8FMT6Rk,31639600,31646318,relationship same-sex marriage should  all be reconsidered president biden in  his remarks today argue the court is
UVob8FMT6Rk,31646318,31652958,taking the country down what he called  an extreme and dangerous path gabe peter  alexander live for us at the white house
UVob8FMT6Rk,31652958,31658878,and for more on the political fallout of  this decision let's bring in nbc's  political director and moderator of meet
UVob8FMT6Rk,31658878,31665920,the press chuck todd so chuck what does  this decision mean for november for both  democrats and republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,31665920,31672958,well i think it does sort of give the  democratic  sort of campaign apparatus a focus and
UVob8FMT6Rk,31672958,31678398,and and some structure and some uh and  an issue to start motivating the base i  mean
UVob8FMT6Rk,31678398,31685120,all of our polling had been indicating  for months it was the republicans that  were more enthusiastic about voting
UVob8FMT6Rk,31685120,31691600,in november than the democrats were  there's been a lot of reasons why  there's democratic demoralization the  economy it is certainly one of them
UVob8FMT6Rk,31691600,31696798,there's disappointment that the  democrats haven't been able to get their  agenda passed there is this sense of hey
UVob8FMT6Rk,31696798,31703360,you control all the levers of power  i think what we've seen here this will  supercharge i think turn out on the left
UVob8FMT6Rk,31703360,31710240,but don't underestimate the impact on  both sides on this one gabe i think what  what we're seeing is we're going to see
UVob8FMT6Rk,31710240,31716080,another extraordinarily close and  contentious national election and that's  the other thing is this is going to be a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31716080,31722318,super nationalized election it may feel  like a more like a presidential than a  typical midterm you know chuck i was
UVob8FMT6Rk,31722318,31727840,watching your analysis earlier on an nbc  news special report and you highlighted  that you thought that the election of
UVob8FMT6Rk,31727840,31733280,donald trump in 2016 really led to the  shattering of stability in this country
UVob8FMT6Rk,31733280,31738840,don't you think that the forces had been  building before that and you know he  simply harnessed it talk to me about
UVob8FMT6Rk,31738840,31744000,that  well let's say look i think you can we  can always sit here and go back and you
UVob8FMT6Rk,31744000,31750638,can go but when you look at sort of that  was a that's a fork in the road mo  moment for the country and so i was
UVob8FMT6Rk,31750638,31757440,putting it under also i mean this is  you know you don't always know in the  election that you have how consequential
UVob8FMT6Rk,31757440,31763120,it's going to be you don't always know  what kind of impact where literally  one
UVob8FMT6Rk,31763120,31768558,decision one different decision would  have put you in a different path  we've had very few presidential
UVob8FMT6Rk,31768558,31775200,elections that have done that 1876 is  one literally  uh we they got you know reconstruction
UVob8FMT6Rk,31775200,31781600,ended um it extended essentially brought  on the era of jim crow it's one of one  of those elections that had it gone a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31781600,31788958,different way  we may have been in a different place on  civil rights in this country a lot  earlier in our nation's history
UVob8FMT6Rk,31788958,31794000,you just look at everything we're  dealing with right now and all the  fallout and his decisions whether it's
UVob8FMT6Rk,31794000,31800558,direct or indirect and i throw that what  we're learning in the january 6 hearings  into this we're just real i mean donald
UVob8FMT6Rk,31800558,31807440,trump's election  has had a a sort of an impact on our on
UVob8FMT6Rk,31807440,31814000,the direction of this nation in ways  that i don't think any of us thought was  coming and it's been absolutely  consequential and chuck picking up on
UVob8FMT6Rk,31814000,31820558,that you've covered a lot of politics  over the years  obviously how do you think this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,31820558,31826958,will impact washington the way we know  it the institutions of washington
UVob8FMT6Rk,31827200,31834080,well  boy i look i i think this the supreme  court is the one that's taken the  biggest hit you know we've already had
UVob8FMT6Rk,31834080,31841280,the rest of our institutions had already  been battered pretty badly right  congress has an approval rating that is  in the single digits a lot of times
UVob8FMT6Rk,31841280,31846638,anywhere from being nine and twelve  percent  um we we see you know we we now are our
UVob8FMT6Rk,31846638,31853200,second straight president that we uh  don't like essentially as a country  under 40 percent um we've already you
UVob8FMT6Rk,31853200,31859600,know the distrust of those institutions  been there but the supreme court gave  that was sort of like it was uh it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,31859600,31865600,it was keeping us together it was the  thread that was keeping us together you  know they'd sit there and it almost  looked like the roberts court for a
UVob8FMT6Rk,31865600,31872240,while really did zigzag  a little bit a little more liberal on  social issues a little more conservative  on economic issues and it seemed they
UVob8FMT6Rk,31872240,31879520,seemed to  strike the balance right this there was  the roberts court um that that kept  health care is the roberts court that uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,31879520,31885120,gave you same-sex marriage  and then  you know we we've we've we've just you
UVob8FMT6Rk,31885120,31891200,know now we're in in in a direction that  i think the supreme court's going to be  seen as very politicized i think because
UVob8FMT6Rk,31891200,31896718,two of the last three  were appointed under unusual  circumstances that many people will say
UVob8FMT6Rk,31896718,31904160,was unethical wasn't illegal but you  know holding open the seat that gorsuch  got and then jamming uh the quick seat
UVob8FMT6Rk,31904160,31909920,that the amy coney bear got  it's gonna erode that trust and gabe  here's the worst part of all of this you
UVob8FMT6Rk,31909920,31915280,have a lot of trump supporters who don't  trust many institutions that he tells  them not to trust now you got a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,31915280,31921520,people on the left don't trust this  supreme court doesn't matter how we get  there but collectively a majority of  this country not trusting many aspects
UVob8FMT6Rk,31921520,31927440,of the rule of law that's not healthy  for this republic  history unfolding before i our eyes
UVob8FMT6Rk,31927440,31933120,chuck todd moderator meet the press  chuck thanks so much for joining us on  top story and while
UVob8FMT6Rk,31933120,31939360,some all around the country are  protesting this decision anti-abortion  groups are celebrating tonight
UVob8FMT6Rk,31939360,31945920,mallory carroll joins us now and she's  the vice president of communications at  the susan b anthony pro-life america
UVob8FMT6Rk,31945920,31951040,mallory what was your reaction to the  decision today  well thank you so much for having me on
UVob8FMT6Rk,31951040,31957040,this evening and i would say um you know  we were overwhelmed with joy this  morning to get this decision it's a win
UVob8FMT6Rk,31957040,31964638,for  democracy first off um you know in 1973  in one day seven unelected men said that
UVob8FMT6Rk,31964638,31969760,they were going to settle this issue in  the hearts and minds of the american  people and in the law and they struck
UVob8FMT6Rk,31969760,31976398,down every single pro-life law that  existed at that point at the state level  and they did the exact opposite of
UVob8FMT6Rk,31976398,31983920,settle this in the hearts and minds of  the american people as we've seen from  the culture wars that have  raged for these last five decades and so
UVob8FMT6Rk,31983920,31989040,today we see this as for what it is it's  the court taking its thumb off the scale
UVob8FMT6Rk,31989040,31995440,and allowing the american people through  their elected representatives to pass  laws that reflect their values and this
UVob8FMT6Rk,31995440,32002080,is what we're going to do is we use the  tools of democracy to debate and to find  consensus at the state level and in
UVob8FMT6Rk,32002080,32008160,washington and it's going to look  different from state to state but  we have the opportunity now to modernize
UVob8FMT6Rk,32008160,32015280,our laws  roe the status quo under roe for these  last 49 years has been abortion on
UVob8FMT6Rk,32015280,32020718,demand up into the moment of birth the  washington post fact checked our  research arm a few years ago the united
UVob8FMT6Rk,32020718,32027200,states is one of seven countries because  of our judicial uh because of our  jurisprudence on this alongside china
UVob8FMT6Rk,32027200,32032958,and north korea one of seven countries  in the world that allows abortion um  after the point the baby can feel pain
UVob8FMT6Rk,32032958,32038160,all the way up to the moment of birth so  we're very encouraged and recognizing  that our work is really just beginning
UVob8FMT6Rk,32038160,32044558,and mallory you mentioned  finding consensus at the state level  how do you think that's possible at this
UVob8FMT6Rk,32044558,32050000,point this is such a divisive issue  i think it is possible i mean over the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32050000,32056478,last 10 years state legislatures have  been passing protections for babies uh
UVob8FMT6Rk,32056478,32062478,who have down syndrome protections for  babies after 20 and 15 weeks those laws
UVob8FMT6Rk,32062478,32069280,have been  passed by dually elected state  legislators that are responsible to the  people who elected them and they've been
UVob8FMT6Rk,32069280,32075360,put under injunction by the courts  because of roe so i think what we're  about to see the actions that we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,32075360,32081440,about to see lawmakers take people who  are again elected by the people to the  legislative branch of government which
UVob8FMT6Rk,32081440,32087680,is charged with setting law  that is what consensus is going to look  like and if there's an overreach if
UVob8FMT6Rk,32087680,32094080,there's a  law that goes too far there's going to  be a quick correction in the next  election cycle so i'm very very
UVob8FMT6Rk,32094080,32100718,interested to hear the conversation with  chuck um  you know we see this is going to be  obviously a huge issue in the midterm
UVob8FMT6Rk,32100718,32107040,elections but the democratic position is  to not just codify roe versus wade but
UVob8FMT6Rk,32107040,32112478,we go beyond it we're talking abortions  performed by non-doctors paid for by  taxpayers
UVob8FMT6Rk,32112478,32118798,throughout all nine months of pregnancy  and preventing again lawmakers future  legislators in congress and at the state
UVob8FMT6Rk,32118798,32124638,level from passing pro-life legislation  regardless of whether or not it's the  will of the people
UVob8FMT6Rk,32124638,32131600,that is an extreme position and we go  door-to-door talking to voters in  battleground states we've been doing  this for the last
UVob8FMT6Rk,32131600,32136638,four election cycles and we've been  working  towards the 2022 election cycle since
UVob8FMT6Rk,32136638,32141920,last summer and what we hear from voters  women in the suburbs hispanic voters
UVob8FMT6Rk,32141920,32148160,other minority voters  people who consider themselves democrat  they're oftentimes going to vote based
UVob8FMT6Rk,32148160,32154638,on their support for another issue  whether it's climate change or something  else that they care about when we talk  to them about the contrast that exists
UVob8FMT6Rk,32154638,32161040,between the two sides on this issue they  are swayed to vote for the pro-life  candidate in that election and with all
UVob8FMT6Rk,32161040,32166398,that our country is going through right  now with pocketbook issues being at the  top of the list of what voters are
UVob8FMT6Rk,32166398,32171600,caring about i think we're going to see  some disappointment
UVob8FMT6Rk,32171600,32177360,from democrats who are running who are  thinking that this is going to be  the um the saving you know the hail mary
UVob8FMT6Rk,32177360,32182558,pass  terry mcauliffe tried to do this in the  virginia gubernatorial race make it all
UVob8FMT6Rk,32182558,32187760,about abortion he lost voters  who considered abortion their top issue
UVob8FMT6Rk,32187760,32194160,by more than 20 points to  the pro-life candidate and now our  current governor glenn younkin so this
UVob8FMT6Rk,32194160,32201920,is a big issue and the historically  pro-life candidates  benefit uh on that on the when it have a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32201920,32209040,winning margin mallory carroll thanks so  much for joining us here on top story uh  mallory is the vice president of
UVob8FMT6Rk,32209040,32214478,communications at the susan b anthony  pro-life america organization thanks so  much for joining us but we want to turn
UVob8FMT6Rk,32214478,32219840,to some breaking news now  and we want to go to new york where  protests are starting to grow jesse
UVob8FMT6Rk,32219840,32225120,kirch joins us live from washington  square park we see the live aerials of
UVob8FMT6Rk,32225120,32232240,the park right now jesse what are you  seeing there right now  hey gabe so we're marching up from
UVob8FMT6Rk,32232240,32238558,washington square park uh we were in new  york's east village uh and we're making  our way uptown there are thousands of
UVob8FMT6Rk,32238558,32244718,people out here you can hear there's uh  there's several groups that have  converged here  multiple organizations you can see
UVob8FMT6Rk,32244718,32250160,people have all kinds of different signs  out here chanting different things i  think one of the things that's notable
UVob8FMT6Rk,32250160,32255360,there were some people that started to  be gathering in washington square park  as early as late morning early afternoon
UVob8FMT6Rk,32255360,32261200,drawing and chalk people coming by  adding their message in chalk uh and the  crowd has just grown throughout the day
UVob8FMT6Rk,32261200,32266638,and multiple groups converged to  washington square park and are now  making their way uptown i don't know if  you can see it but off in the distance
UVob8FMT6Rk,32266638,32272080,is the world trade center just to give  people context and we are heading for  union square so further uptown in
UVob8FMT6Rk,32272080,32278718,manhattan i've asked people  multiple questions but one of the things  i was asking about is do you think this  makes a difference in the fall obviously
UVob8FMT6Rk,32278718,32286160,in the context of where we are this is  new york city in a state in a city that  is very much supporting abortion rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,32286160,32292000,so this is not the place where those  rights in theory are directly under  threat right now so there are a couple
UVob8FMT6Rk,32292000,32297680,things that have motivated people to be  out here tonight some people tell me  they're here to express their support
UVob8FMT6Rk,32297680,32303280,for women across this country one woman  was here with her young daughter who was  up on her shoulders and and looked at
UVob8FMT6Rk,32303280,32309760,this as a symbolism for uh rights for  her daughter being taken away  more broadly and there's also a message
UVob8FMT6Rk,32309760,32316080,from some people here to be sending a  message across the country to women in  other states where they do not now have
UVob8FMT6Rk,32316080,32322080,access to abortion rights that they are  supporting them even from here in new  york city and jesse i see
UVob8FMT6Rk,32322080,32327200,some kids there in the crowd some entire  families there obviously very passionate
UVob8FMT6Rk,32327200,32332240,uh on this issue um  again  they're heading uptown you said now do
UVob8FMT6Rk,32332240,32337360,you have any idea how long they plan to  be out on the streets uh throughout the  night
UVob8FMT6Rk,32337600,32343360,yeah well you know frankly this appears  to be multiple organizations that have  come together there was a rally that was
UVob8FMT6Rk,32343360,32348558,growing in washington square park we  knew there was simultaneously another  rally that was going on uptown and a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32348558,32353920,group appeared to make their way  downtown and converge on washington  square park which is of course where
UVob8FMT6Rk,32353920,32359280,that iconic arches in lower manhattan so  this uh frankly i don't know how far how
UVob8FMT6Rk,32359280,32366318,long this is going to go on we believe  the endpoint might be union square park  which we're we're just a couple blocks  away from uh and you know there are
UVob8FMT6Rk,32366318,32373360,people who have been lining the streets  holding up signs even if they're not  marching with this group people taking  photos uh but i mean it was hard to get
UVob8FMT6Rk,32373360,32380080,a full grip on the scale of the number  of people in washington square park by  the end they were uh pouring out of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32380080,32385440,north end of the park and probably uh  much of it we made our way through the  park and you can tell i mean i'm looking
UVob8FMT6Rk,32385440,32391360,back gabe and this goes at least two  three four city blocks uh and it's  really hard to see how far down it might
UVob8FMT6Rk,32391360,32397200,go so a lot of people out here jesse  kirch live for us in new york city jesse  thank you for a closer look at today's
UVob8FMT6Rk,32397200,32403040,decision and the future of the supreme  court i want to bring in tom goldstein  he's an nbc news contributor and the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32403040,32410240,contributor rather and the founder of  the popular scotus blog he's a supreme  court expert of course and tom surely we
UVob8FMT6Rk,32410240,32418240,should adhere closely to the principles  of judicial restraint here but uh where  the broader path of the court chooses um
UVob8FMT6Rk,32418240,32424478,you know it's entailing repeating  repudiating i should say a  constitutional right we have not only
UVob8FMT6Rk,32424478,32431200,previously recognized but it also  expressly reaffirmed applying the  doctrine of stare decisis so putting
UVob8FMT6Rk,32431200,32438638,that in layman's terms the chief justice  is essentially saying the court went too  far here right back in 1973.
UVob8FMT6Rk,32438638,32444718,well what the chief justice is saying  today is that he would have upheld  missouri's abortion restriction would
UVob8FMT6Rk,32444718,32451520,have allowed the state  to say that you cannot have an abortion  after 15 weeks of pregnancy but he would
UVob8FMT6Rk,32451520,32457520,have not overruled roe vs wade that he  would have tried to chart a middle  ground
UVob8FMT6Rk,32457520,32463360,narrowing roe versus wade further  because it wasn't necessary to decide in  this case whether to overturn that
UVob8FMT6Rk,32463360,32468398,decision  and he criticized his five more  conservative colleagues for going
UVob8FMT6Rk,32468398,32475600,that much more dramatic step  overturning one of the foundational  precedents that all americans know
UVob8FMT6Rk,32475600,32481600,and it's just a choice between  two different strands of conservativism  of how aggressive they want to be but
UVob8FMT6Rk,32481600,32487040,make no mistake about it there are six  votes on the supreme court who think  that roe is wrongly decided but only
UVob8FMT6Rk,32487040,32492638,five to actually overturn it and tom  we've known about this 63 ideological  balance of the court since justice coney
UVob8FMT6Rk,32492638,32498558,barrett was confirmed but do you think  this will reignite conversations about  expanding the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,32498558,32504398,it probably will uh you know it's very  interesting that all of us generally  assume that because there are nine
UVob8FMT6Rk,32504398,32510878,justices on the supreme court there have  to be under the constitution that's not  true there have been more there have  been less at different times congress
UVob8FMT6Rk,32510878,32516798,decides how many justices there are and  theoretically a democratic congress with  a democratic president could decide to
UVob8FMT6Rk,32516798,32524718,make it 11 13 15 different members on  the supreme court but  centrist democrats inside the senate
UVob8FMT6Rk,32524718,32530160,are extremely unlikely to  approve that kind of measure and that's  been the barrier that they haven't been
UVob8FMT6Rk,32530160,32536240,able to overcome now today may change  that calculus a little bit they'd have  to get rid of the filibuster and vote to
UVob8FMT6Rk,32536240,32542000,increase the size of the supreme court  but in theory they could go ahead and do  it and reinstate roe vs wade
UVob8FMT6Rk,32542000,32548240,so in his concurring opinion justice  thomas named several other court  opinions which upheld the right to
UVob8FMT6Rk,32548240,32553520,contraception  um and legalize gay marriage um so
UVob8FMT6Rk,32553520,32558638,is he essentially forecasting future  targets here and opinions that the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,32558638,32565360,uh may hand down in the future  well he's definitely saying today i want  us to revisit those cases the cases that
UVob8FMT6Rk,32565360,32571840,say that you have a constitutional right  to contraception that you cannot  criminalize sodomy that there is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32571840,32577120,constitutional right to gay marriage the  majority responds his other colleagues
UVob8FMT6Rk,32577120,32583040,respond you know no no no no no we're  not calling any of that into question  but it's as the dissent says it's a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32583040,32589120,little hard to see how the decision over  ruling rogue gets rid of a very very  foundational
UVob8FMT6Rk,32589120,32594318,long accepted precedent in the law it  and it does so on the ground that the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32594318,32599600,right to abortion isn't long settled in  the nation's history well neither is a  right to contraception neither is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32599600,32605760,right to engage in homosexual conduct  and neither is a right to same-sex  marriage so it's gonna be quite the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32605760,32611760,needle that has to be  thread  in order for the conservatives to
UVob8FMT6Rk,32611760,32616958,overturn this decision and not the  others but we're going to see those  cases for the next 10 years i'm sure
UVob8FMT6Rk,32616958,32622958,tom goldstein thanks so much as we  mentioned earlier in the broadcast  abortion restrictions are likely to take
UVob8FMT6Rk,32622958,32629280,effect in more than half the country  some states where it will remain legal  are anticipating an influx of patients
UVob8FMT6Rk,32629280,32637520,who will travel to get the procedure and  some abortion providers are even  relocating your stephanie gosk with more
UVob8FMT6Rk,32637520,32643520,with the stroke of a pen the supreme  court has likely triggered a massive  abortion migration in this country more
UVob8FMT6Rk,32643520,32649360,than 300 thousand abortions were  performed last year in the 26 states  where the procedure could soon be
UVob8FMT6Rk,32649360,32654718,illegal or highly restricted now those  people may choose to cross state lines
UVob8FMT6Rk,32654718,32661520,in tennessee the attorney general wants  the state's six-week ban to start right  now the people of tennessee for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32661520,32667440,first time in 50 years will have a  chance to weigh in on this issue so this  is where we do our abortion procedures
UVob8FMT6Rk,32667440,32673040,back here these are your  two abortion seizure rooms you have two  rooms
UVob8FMT6Rk,32673040,32680478,we recently visited the choices health  care clinic in memphis soon the doors to  these rooms will be closed for good our
UVob8FMT6Rk,32680478,32685840,patients are predominantly black  the majority of them are uninsured or
UVob8FMT6Rk,32685840,32691600,underinsured they have been bracing for  this court decision for months we just  kind of all thought this is going to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,32691600,32698240,really bad for us and so  i said to my executive team there's this  place called carbondale carbondale is in
UVob8FMT6Rk,32698240,32704318,southern illinois three hours by car  from memphis it's where they plan to  open a new clinic in august but were
UVob8FMT6Rk,32704318,32711520,reluctant to show us pictures because of  security concerns clinician nakia  grayson will be driving back and forth
UVob8FMT6Rk,32711520,32718878,will it be big enough to handle what is  really going to be  potentially a flood of patients right
UVob8FMT6Rk,32718878,32724000,now that's a good question  i don't know i think that
UVob8FMT6Rk,32724000,32730240,we will be the only clinic right now in  the southern part of illinois  we will handle
UVob8FMT6Rk,32730240,32736558,as many patients as we can  in some states where abortion will still  be legal access is being expanded
UVob8FMT6Rk,32736558,32743200,connecticut passed a law allowing  non-physicians to provide abortions but  fancy abortion activists hope increasing
UVob8FMT6Rk,32743200,32748318,support systems during pregnancy will  change people's minds i don't know of
UVob8FMT6Rk,32748318,32753600,anybody that is or any state that is  thinking that they can stop people from
UVob8FMT6Rk,32753600,32760958,traveling to another state we are going  to have to just push even harder than we  have been to encourage women to let
UVob8FMT6Rk,32760958,32767840,their baby live and to seek out the  resources that are available but for  many of those who choose not to getting
UVob8FMT6Rk,32767840,32774640,an abortion just got a whole lot harder  stephanie gosk nbc news memphis  tennessee and we thank stephanie for
UVob8FMT6Rk,32774640,32780558,that report in states like north dakota  those quote trigger laws are expected to  go into effect and completely ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,32780558,32785680,abortion in 30 days now the only  abortion clinic in that state from red
UVob8FMT6Rk,32785680,32792558,river women's clinic is continuing to  provide abortions until it is illegal  then it's set to move to minnesota the
UVob8FMT6Rk,32792558,32800718,head nurse of that clinic sarah hader  joins top story again and sarah first i  have to ask how are you doing
UVob8FMT6Rk,32800718,32805840,um  not well
UVob8FMT6Rk,32806480,32811680,trying to hold it together  when you heard of this decision this
UVob8FMT6Rk,32811680,32819320,morning and you had to have been  expecting it for weeks after that draft  was leaked what went through your head
UVob8FMT6Rk,32820480,32825680,um  that our patients  anyone who can be pregnant
UVob8FMT6Rk,32825680,32831360,in  any of the states  surrounding us but minnesota  are
UVob8FMT6Rk,32831360,32836640,going to have even more obstacles in  front of them
UVob8FMT6Rk,32837598,32844160,so we know the clinic will be moving  what do you think that will mean for the  women in north dakota and what will it
UVob8FMT6Rk,32844160,32850558,mean for abortion providers in  surrounding states  sure  well
UVob8FMT6Rk,32850558,32858840,um you know we had we were inundated  with calls from patients today  just saying that um
UVob8FMT6Rk,32858840,32865438,they were wondering if abortion was  still legal if their appointment was  still valid in north dakota were they
UVob8FMT6Rk,32865438,32870878,going to be able to receive an abortion  um  so
UVob8FMT6Rk,32870878,32878640,the stigma and  all of the politics are definitely  adding to our patient's stress
UVob8FMT6Rk,32878640,32884718,um  but what it means is that women of low  income
UVob8FMT6Rk,32884718,32889758,will not be able to access  access abortion care safe and legal
UVob8FMT6Rk,32889758,32896640,abortion care  and what have you been telling people  who  have been calling you
UVob8FMT6Rk,32896640,32902878,um we've been telling them that abortion  is still legal  and that we are going to be providing
UVob8FMT6Rk,32902878,32910398,safe  and legal abortion care until the state  of north dakota tells us that we cannot
UVob8FMT6Rk,32910398,32917758,you know a few minutes ago we spoke with  um an anti-abortion organization that  you know is celebrating this decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,32917758,32925840,that  you know abortion will now be left up to  the states i'm curious what's your  response to what she had to say
UVob8FMT6Rk,32925918,32932320,well um they keep on saying that they  are fighting for the fetus's life
UVob8FMT6Rk,32932320,32938800,we are going to continue to fight for  women's lives  we will do whatever we can to make sure
UVob8FMT6Rk,32938800,32945278,that women can still access safe and  legal abortion  um if we have to help them with travel
UVob8FMT6Rk,32945278,32951680,and  child care and whatever they need to  make it happen we will
UVob8FMT6Rk,32951680,32957520,um  but government mandated pregnancy are  three words i never thought would be
UVob8FMT6Rk,32957520,32963122,in the same sentence  you know i got the sense  just listening to you it's obviously a
UVob8FMT6Rk,32963122,32968800,very emotional day  and i  is this just about reproductive rights
UVob8FMT6Rk,32968800,32974480,or is it about much  it's more  much more  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,32974480,32982000,when a woman is told that we cannot  determine our own destiny  um that we have to practice someone
UVob8FMT6Rk,32982000,32988320,else's moral beliefs  um  we wonder what country are we in you
UVob8FMT6Rk,32988320,32993438,know the united states was founded on  the principle of separation of church  and state
UVob8FMT6Rk,32993438,32998480,and these justices are practicing their  religion in their
UVob8FMT6Rk,32998480,33004558,um  judgments and in their opinions and this  should just not be allowed that's the
UVob8FMT6Rk,33004558,33010480,reason this country was founded  i should be able to practice no religion  and you should be able to practice
UVob8FMT6Rk,33010480,33015840,whatever religion you would like but i  sure certainly should not have to
UVob8FMT6Rk,33015840,33022160,um  continue a pregnancy just because you  think that that is the morally sound

UVob8FMT6Rk,33179598,33185758,back now with another major story  tonight the biggest changes to our  nation's gun laws in nearly 30 years
UVob8FMT6Rk,33185758,33192160,congress passing a bipartisan bill a  little more than a month after the  uvalde school shooting garrett hank
UVob8FMT6Rk,33192160,33198800,joins us now from capitol hill and  garrett this breaks decades of  congressional  gridlock on guns walk us through what's
UVob8FMT6Rk,33198800,33204718,in the bill and what happens next  yeah gabe i mean it's the biggest bill  in 30 years but it's really about a
UVob8FMT6Rk,33204718,33210160,decade in the making after the sandy  hook shooting you had chris murphy the  connecticut senator really start to dig
UVob8FMT6Rk,33210160,33216398,in and work on this issue and it frankly  took the massacre in juvalde a little  more than a month ago for him to have a
UVob8FMT6Rk,33216398,33221918,proper negotiating partner on the other  side john cornyn the two of them form  the core of the group that's been
UVob8FMT6Rk,33221918,33227200,working on this bill for a little over a  month at its centerpiece is something  that you know would hopefully address
UVob8FMT6Rk,33227200,33233122,the unique circumstances around the  uvalde shooting and the buffalo shooting  before that these enhanced background
UVob8FMT6Rk,33233122,33238640,checks for gun buyers between the ages  of 18 and 21 the idea here is that those
UVob8FMT6Rk,33238640,33245360,gun buyers don't just pop into existence  in terms of background checks on the day  they turn 18. that's a big piece of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,33245360,33251520,the other big piece of these incentives  to set up red flag laws around the  country there are 19 states that have
UVob8FMT6Rk,33251520,33258160,extreme risk protection orders of some  kind where a judge could intervene and  take guns out of the hands of dangerous
UVob8FMT6Rk,33258160,33263438,individuals they would like to increase  that number they can't force states to  do it and so they've tried to
UVob8FMT6Rk,33263438,33270078,incentivize it and then there's really  the carrot for republican votes in  particular that's about a seven billion  dollar investment in mental health
UVob8FMT6Rk,33270078,33275680,services republicans who haven't wanted  to look at this as a guns issue i wanted  to talk about it as a mental health
UVob8FMT6Rk,33275680,33281438,issue got what they wanted in this bill  that was critical to lining up mitch  mcconnell's support the minority leader
UVob8FMT6Rk,33281438,33286878,and with him came a host of other  republicans so what we saw late last  night 15 republican senators joining
UVob8FMT6Rk,33286878,33293840,with all 50 democrats to pass this bill  and what was it emotional vote with gun  violence victims and advocates in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,33293840,33299918,gallery watching and then today the  house following suit with only 14 house  republicans joining
UVob8FMT6Rk,33299918,33306238,all congressional democrats to vote in  favor of this bill though gabe it was  interesting to note you had the  republican members who represent both
UVob8FMT6Rk,33306238,33312398,buffalo and juvalde among that number  voting to send this bill to the  president's desk and garrett let's take
UVob8FMT6Rk,33312398,33319040,a step back here this guns bill was  expected to be the big headline of the  day and then of course the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,33319040,33325598,decision came down how much has the  focus shifted on the hill and how  remarkable was that
UVob8FMT6Rk,33325598,33331918,almost entirely i mean lawmakers  finished up particularly in the senate  last night a lot of these folks went  home thinking they would be going back
UVob8FMT6Rk,33331918,33338320,to their district and starting to  campaign on this legislation but in a  moment when that supreme court decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,33338320,33344160,came out today this issue shifted to the  back burner it made for some awkward  moments today with house democrats
UVob8FMT6Rk,33344160,33349758,passing the bill this morning or this  afternoon rather and then trying to  still hold some events around taking
UVob8FMT6Rk,33349758,33356398,credit for it uh you know you for  example we don't see the white house  having a major signing ceremony today it
UVob8FMT6Rk,33356398,33364078,just doesn't fit in the moment but you  know for lawmakers who have been stuck  on nothing on this issue for so long i
UVob8FMT6Rk,33364078,33369918,do expect to see you know the bells and  whistles of a proper signing ceremony at  some point and lawmakers going out and
UVob8FMT6Rk,33369918,33376800,trying to campaign on this democratic  activists in particular have demanded  this legislation and in a rare moment
UVob8FMT6Rk,33376800,33382718,congress broke the gridlock to deliver  it  these are not folks who like to  undersell their accomplishments gabe so
UVob8FMT6Rk,33382718,33388800,i suspect uh those days will come soon  enough garrett hank on capitol hill  garrett thank you turning now to an nbc

UVob8FMT6Rk,34458960,34465596,a range of strong reactions  it feels like a betrayal it feels like
UVob8FMT6Rk,34465596,34471436,my country doesn't love me this is the  first step in building a culture of life
UVob8FMT6Rk,34471436,34478240,we'll hear what folks are saying across  america including in states where new  abortion bans just took effect but this
UVob8FMT6Rk,34478240,34485200,ruling did not ban abortion outright  that's not what it says we'll break down  the majority's rationale for overturning
UVob8FMT6Rk,34485200,34491520,roe and the dissenters warning about the  future of the court  and we'll consider the impact of all
UVob8FMT6Rk,34491520,34497840,this from the changes to women's  reproductive health care to the next  phase of this political fight both sides

UVob8FMT6Rk,34514672,34518532,[Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,34520240,34525596,so we knew today would come right a day  we were sure would get emotions running  high
UVob8FMT6Rk,34525596,34532160,well tonight americans have plenty of  reactions and almost as many questions  supporters and opponents of abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,34532160,34538800,rights have been gathering across  america they're reacting to the supreme  court overturning two key precedents roe
UVob8FMT6Rk,34538800,34545756,versus wade and a companion decision  planned parenthood versus casey  today president biden was clear in his
UVob8FMT6Rk,34545756,34552244,opposition to the ruling and he asked  americans to remain peaceful as they  take to the
UVob8FMT6Rk,34552840,34558960,streets today is a uh  it's not hyperbole to suggest a very
UVob8FMT6Rk,34558960,34565596,solid moment  today the supreme court of the united  states  expressly took away
UVob8FMT6Rk,34565596,34571680,the constitutional right from the  american people  that it already recognized
UVob8FMT6Rk,34571680,34579680,i call on everyone no matter how deeply  they care about this decision  to keep all protests peaceful
UVob8FMT6Rk,34579680,34586720,peaceful peaceful peaceful no  intimidation  violence is never acceptable but this
UVob8FMT6Rk,34586720,34593276,decision  must not be the final word  my administration will use all of its
UVob8FMT6Rk,34593276,34598800,appropriate lawful  powers but congress must act
UVob8FMT6Rk,34598800,34605840,and with your vote  you can act  you can have the final word
UVob8FMT6Rk,34605840,34612640,this is not over  this case involved a 2018 abortion ban
UVob8FMT6Rk,34612640,34618080,from mississippi the court issued a kind  of split ruling it ruled six to three to
UVob8FMT6Rk,34618080,34624480,uphold mississippi's ban and it ruled  five to four to overturn roe and casey
UVob8FMT6Rk,34624480,34630080,we'll explain why that split matters in  just a bit  justice samuel alito wrote the opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,34630080,34636840,of the court joined by justices clarence  thomas neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh and  amy coney barrett the opinion looked
UVob8FMT6Rk,34636840,34642400,extremely similar to the draft that  leaked last month it reads in part quote
UVob8FMT6Rk,34642400,34648560,the constitution makes no reference to  abortion it is time to heed the  constitution and return the issue of
UVob8FMT6Rk,34648560,34655040,abortion to the people's elected  representatives unquote  justices stephen breyer elena kagan and
UVob8FMT6Rk,34655040,34661756,sonia sotomayor dissented their dissent  ends this way quote with sorrow for this
UVob8FMT6Rk,34661756,34669596,court but more for the many millions of  american women who today lost a  fundamental constitutional protection we
UVob8FMT6Rk,34669596,34676880,dissent  unquote  after the ruling came out this morning  13 states took action on so-called
UVob8FMT6Rk,34676880,34682080,trigger laws these laws were designed to  take effect if roe were struck down each
UVob8FMT6Rk,34682080,34687680,state's attorney general must certify  these triggers to activate them  arkansas's attorney general leslie
UVob8FMT6Rk,34687680,34693916,rutledge did so today  i am proud to announce as chief legal
UVob8FMT6Rk,34693916,34700560,officer for the state of arkansas  that the united states supreme court has
UVob8FMT6Rk,34700560,34707360,in fact overruled roe versus wade  and planned parenthood versus casey
UVob8FMT6Rk,34707360,34715968,thereby restoring the state of arkansas  the authority  to prohibit abortions
UVob8FMT6Rk,34715968,34721756,[Music]  if you're like us you've spent all day  either watching tv
UVob8FMT6Rk,34721756,34727200,getting alerts on your phone or very  deep in social media  well this hour is your chance to catch
UVob8FMT6Rk,34727200,34733436,your breath  make sense of what happened share your  thoughts with us and get some answers  about what comes next
UVob8FMT6Rk,34733436,34739040,our teams following what's happening  tonight including in mississippi the  state where this case started and in
UVob8FMT6Rk,34739040,34745916,florida where abortion will remain legal  at least for now but let's begin at the  u.s supreme court in washington where
UVob8FMT6Rk,34745916,34752480,nbc's maura barrett is standing by live  maura tell us what you see and what's  going on where you are
UVob8FMT6Rk,34753520,34760320,well joshua i'm going to apologize in  advance because it is very loud here and  you might hear some explicit language
UVob8FMT6Rk,34760320,34766480,because there's very high energy here  right in front of the supreme court  we've seen a mix of emotions throughout
UVob8FMT6Rk,34766480,34772640,the day i want to show you uh what a  little bit of what's going on right here  um but basically right when the decision
UVob8FMT6Rk,34772640,34778480,came down there was a pretty large group  for the middle of the day on a friday of  opposing viewpoints
UVob8FMT6Rk,34778480,34786560,and then as after a few initial  uh  initial decision came down uh the the
UVob8FMT6Rk,34786560,34793276,people that opposed the right to an  abortion uh were celebrating jumping up  and down and then after a few hours they
UVob8FMT6Rk,34793276,34799276,left and now you're left with an  escalated crowd of at least a thousand  people from the vantage point i can see
UVob8FMT6Rk,34799276,34805520,that are all supporters of abortion  rights despite the fact that this  decision came down overruling or
UVob8FMT6Rk,34805520,34812880,overturning uh roe versus way there is  still a lot of energy  and and hope that congress will do
UVob8FMT6Rk,34812880,34818080,something states will do something but  first before i show you more about  what's going on on the ground here i  want you to hear some of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,34818080,34823120,conversations that i heard today as we  saw tears of joy and tears of despair as
UVob8FMT6Rk,34823120,34829120,i spoke with people who who expressed  varying opinions take a listen
UVob8FMT6Rk,34829360,34834720,it's a rollercoaster of emotion it's  it's  complete and utter joy that it was
UVob8FMT6Rk,34834720,34840320,finally overturned  anger  deep sadness
UVob8FMT6Rk,34840320,34845756,and  a desire to turn this around  is going through my mind
UVob8FMT6Rk,34845756,34850880,i'm worried for the young women who are  on opposition who don't understand how
UVob8FMT6Rk,34850880,34858560,at risk their lives may be  personally i've had  people in my family have abortions and
UVob8FMT6Rk,34858560,34865360,they have felt the regret years and  years down the line and they're still  dealing and facing with the trauma today
UVob8FMT6Rk,34865360,34871756,and if roe v wade wouldn't have been  legal inside of the united states i  would have family members that i don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,34871756,34878560,have today  i think our best bet is legislatively  but unfortunately people are going to  die women are going to die between now
UVob8FMT6Rk,34878560,34883596,and when we can get legislation passed  which is
UVob8FMT6Rk,34883596,34889596,untenable  [Music]  so obviously there is a lot of energy
UVob8FMT6Rk,34889596,34896480,here on the ground but i do want to note  that it has been largely peaceful we've  seen some interactions some verbal
UVob8FMT6Rk,34896480,34901596,arguments between both sides of the  groups but i've also seen leveled out  arguments where two people are just
UVob8FMT6Rk,34901596,34907596,talking and having a conversation and  trying to understand uh both sides but  here as the day has moved on there's a
UVob8FMT6Rk,34907596,34913596,frustration with the justices for both  today's decision and the decision we saw  yesterday when it comes to guns we've
UVob8FMT6Rk,34913596,34919276,heard from dc believes that they've  ramped up police presence here and  throughout the city in preparation for
UVob8FMT6Rk,34919276,34924800,anything that might transpire but as of  now they're what we're seeing on the  ground is not as much of that
UVob8FMT6Rk,34924800,34931436,celebration that we saw initially but  that leveled frustration and the hope  that despite the the country being in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,34931436,34936800,divisive state as people told me today  that congress uh will actually pass a
UVob8FMT6Rk,34936800,34942800,row into federal law or that we might  see a different decision uh from the  states to make sure that the right to a
UVob8FMT6Rk,34942800,34948560,safe abortion that's what people kept  emphasizing to me was that the safe  abortion part is key because as they see
UVob8FMT6Rk,34948560,34953596,it uh women will just get hurt uh or die  from the fact that this is no longer a
UVob8FMT6Rk,34953596,34960080,protected right joshua  thank you maura that's nbc's maura  barrett starting us off from just west
UVob8FMT6Rk,34960080,34967276,of the u.s supreme court in washington  let's turn now to nbc's kathy park who  is in mississippi forest and kathy the
UVob8FMT6Rk,34967276,34973596,clinic at the center of all of this  jackson women's health held a news  conference a few hours ago
UVob8FMT6Rk,34973596,34978640,what did they say and what are they  anticipating for the future
UVob8FMT6Rk,34979916,34988080,well joshua good evening to you as you  know we are in a trigger lawsuit and  because of this law essentially the days
UVob8FMT6Rk,34988080,34994400,are numbered for this clinic so  organizers acknowledge that fact they  noticed they have received an influx of
UVob8FMT6Rk,34994400,34999756,calls with questions and concerns ahead  of this decision today and they say they
UVob8FMT6Rk,34999756,35005840,will continue  opening their doors for for women who  are accessing their services up until
UVob8FMT6Rk,35005840,35012240,that 10-day period obviously they're  saying that this was a disappointing day  they're angered and frustrated but  they're not surprised because of that
UVob8FMT6Rk,35012240,35018796,leak back in may but they essentially  double down saying that their work isn't  over take a listen
UVob8FMT6Rk,35020160,35026320,today  across this country  half the population
UVob8FMT6Rk,35026320,35032320,were stripped of their human rights  um
UVob8FMT6Rk,35033040,35038240,it's hard to say this but that's just  the beginning i tell you today we're not  laying down
UVob8FMT6Rk,35038240,35044960,we're not giving up women have always  had abortions  no matter what it took
UVob8FMT6Rk,35044960,35052724,even if it was their life  and we're going to make sure that that's  not on the line here
UVob8FMT6Rk,35055040,35060880,and joshua you can hear their voices  just see the emotion it certainly was a  difficult day for them but once again
UVob8FMT6Rk,35060880,35066320,they said look the doors might be  closing the next couple of days but  behind the scenes they have been getting
UVob8FMT6Rk,35066320,35072560,ready for this day so they have another  clinic that they're working on they plan  on opening that location
UVob8FMT6Rk,35072560,35080160,soon but that will be in new mexico but  obviously that is a big concern moving  forward once this ban is officially in
UVob8FMT6Rk,35080160,35086960,place here in the state of mississippi  because of this trigger law  essentially it will be a challenge for
UVob8FMT6Rk,35086960,35092400,women accessing  abortion services they will have to  travel to places like illinois
UVob8FMT6Rk,35092400,35099040,massachusetts and new mexico  joshua  thank you kathy nbc's kathy park
UVob8FMT6Rk,35099040,35104800,continuing in jackson mississippi for us  tonight now let's make our way to  central florida saint petersburg to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,35104800,35110960,exact where nbc zinc clay essenwi is  standing by and zinc clay florida is one  of the only states south of virginia i
UVob8FMT6Rk,35110960,35117192,believe according to experts where  abortion remains legal at least for now
UVob8FMT6Rk,35117192,35122880,[Music]  yeah joshua good evening so this is  really interesting florida actually has
UVob8FMT6Rk,35122880,35129756,a privacy clause in its constitution  that many consider stricter than the u.s  constitution what does that mean for
UVob8FMT6Rk,35129756,35135680,abortion well it's meant that  restrictions on abortion in this state  have been very difficult and have made
UVob8FMT6Rk,35135680,35142240,people consider florida a safe haven now  of course that term is relative and what  it's meant is compared to other southern
UVob8FMT6Rk,35142240,35147276,states we've seen like alabama like  georgia many have flocked to florida for
UVob8FMT6Rk,35147276,35153276,abortions now is the state perfect on  this front no they have 24-hour wait  periods before an abortion can take
UVob8FMT6Rk,35153276,35158720,place and starting july 1st there will  be a 15-week abortion ban that's by
UVob8FMT6Rk,35158720,35165596,republican governor ron desantis but  many are now afraid joshua that this  scotus decision will further back up
UVob8FMT6Rk,35165596,35172160,that 15-week ban even though it's been  facing a lot of contests in the courts  so a lot of dynamics at play especially
UVob8FMT6Rk,35172160,35177040,right here in florida today and people  have been speaking up
UVob8FMT6Rk,35181200,35186720,i'm thrilled this is a great celebration  it's a wonderful day for all of our
UVob8FMT6Rk,35186720,35192800,children across america this is a war on  women  pure and simple and it's outrageous this
UVob8FMT6Rk,35192800,35199120,is happening in our country i mean this  is 2022 and it feels like 1952. it's  painful today yeah
UVob8FMT6Rk,35199120,35204160,it really hurts  i can't believe our country has gone
UVob8FMT6Rk,35204160,35210000,backwards  do you have hope for the future
UVob8FMT6Rk,35210000,35215436,only if people vote  [Music]
UVob8FMT6Rk,35215436,35220640,so really joshua today here in florida  has been the tale of two americas some
UVob8FMT6Rk,35220640,35227520,celebrating some morning right behind me  there were a thousand people gathered  protesting marching around this block
UVob8FMT6Rk,35227520,35233520,saying our bodies our choice at the same  time there were anti-abortion advocates  saying this is what we've been waiting
UVob8FMT6Rk,35233520,35238720,for so a lot to unpack joshua  before i let you guys in clay the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35238720,35243916,gentleman in the shirt and tie that we  saw that's congressman charlie chris the  democrat who represents that area
UVob8FMT6Rk,35243916,35249840,formerly the governor of the state of  florida who governed as a republican i  remember covering him many years ago did
UVob8FMT6Rk,35249840,35256560,you get the sense that people are  expecting this to become a political  battle in the state of florida i imagine  the politics feel very different between
UVob8FMT6Rk,35256560,35262400,north florida central and south florida  but  did people give you a sense of where  they expect this to go whether this
UVob8FMT6Rk,35262400,35267680,becomes a ballot box issue  i'm glad you pointed that out joshua
UVob8FMT6Rk,35267680,35272960,because he is a gubernatorial candidate  he served three decades and in multiple  parties and i think in many ways
UVob8FMT6Rk,35272960,35279916,reflects this interesting point the  country is in right now right there are  many heated debates and heated opinions
UVob8FMT6Rk,35279916,35286000,but the reality is roe has been  overturned and so what i heard from  people i talked to a 70 year old and an
UVob8FMT6Rk,35286000,35291680,eight-year-old woman who expressed that  they marched for abortion rights in the  70s they said people need to vote i
UVob8FMT6Rk,35291680,35297680,spoke with younger women who expressed  just frustration that they didn't feel  like their lawmakers were representing
UVob8FMT6Rk,35297680,35302720,them well so a lot of range but overall  the sentiment regardless of you has been
UVob8FMT6Rk,35302720,35308720,the work continues for anti-abortion  advocates they say now we need to go to  the states and make sure no states are
UVob8FMT6Rk,35308720,35314640,allowing abortions and for those  in favor they're saying we need to keep  fighting we need to support these
UVob8FMT6Rk,35314640,35320000,clinics and make sure women's rights are  protected so a lot to watch out for  joshua
UVob8FMT6Rk,35320000,35325680,thank you zinc clay that's nbc zinc clay  essenwi joining us from saint petersburg  florida now a lot of you have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,35325680,35331360,sharing your thoughts and stories with  us way before this ruling and we got  quite a few more today we'll share some
UVob8FMT6Rk,35331360,35336560,of those questions and comments  throughout this hour but before we move  on we should acknowledge the other big
UVob8FMT6Rk,35336560,35341596,story out of washington tonight and  today the house passed that bipartisan
UVob8FMT6Rk,35341596,35346720,gun violence prevention bill it's been  41 days since a deadly supermarket
UVob8FMT6Rk,35346720,35354240,shooting in buffalo new york and exactly  one month since the mass shooting in  uvalde texas now 14 house republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,35354240,35360160,voted for the measure it's called the  bipartisan safer communities act among
UVob8FMT6Rk,35360160,35366880,other things it would enhance background  checks for younger gun buyers fund  school safety and mental health programs
UVob8FMT6Rk,35366880,35372320,and it would address gun violence in  intimate relationships something known  as the boyfriend loophole
UVob8FMT6Rk,35372320,35379120,the house has officially sent the bill  to president biden's desk it is unclear  exactly when he will sign it into law
UVob8FMT6Rk,35379120,35384480,he's got some international travel  coming up so the timing is a bit of a  question mark but we'll keep an eye on
UVob8FMT6Rk,35384480,35389756,that  for now though we are focusing this hour  on today's landmark supreme court ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,35389756,35396000,still to come we'll get some legal  analysis of the ruling itself the  rationale for the opinion the scathing
UVob8FMT6Rk,35396000,35402480,warnings in the descent and the legal  impact of it all plus we'll hear from an  abortion provider on what this could

UVob8FMT6Rk,35539520,35546560,the tragic death and the hopes for peace  in vietnam  is the decision of the united states  supreme court it handed down a historic
UVob8FMT6Rk,35546560,35553200,decision about abortion the court said  in a 7-2 decision that  in the first three months of pregnancy
UVob8FMT6Rk,35553200,35560080,only the woman and her physician may  decide whether she may have an abortion  in the second three months all the state
UVob8FMT6Rk,35560080,35565200,may do is regulate abortion procedures  and only in the final three months of
UVob8FMT6Rk,35565200,35572560,pregnancy can the state forbid abortion  the court ruled in cases from texas and  georgia but all 50 states are effective
UVob8FMT6Rk,35572560,35579000,whatever they're lost  that was nbc's garrick utley from  january 22nd
UVob8FMT6Rk,35579000,35585040,1973 when the supreme court decided roe  versus wade seven to two today marks the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35585040,35590400,first time the high court has taken away  a legal protection that it conferred
UVob8FMT6Rk,35590400,35597680,justices decided 6-3 to uphold a  mississippi abortion restriction a law  that clearly violated roe but as for
UVob8FMT6Rk,35597680,35605520,that precedent the court overturned it  by a vote of five to four  the reason for those two different votes
UVob8FMT6Rk,35605520,35612320,reveals a lot about the justice's views  of the proper role of the court it also  speaks to their expectations and
UVob8FMT6Rk,35612320,35618480,concerns for the future  let's get into that with nbc news legal  analyst barbara mcquaid she's a former
UVob8FMT6Rk,35618480,35624960,u.s attorney and a law professor at the  university of michigan law school  professor welcome
UVob8FMT6Rk,35624960,35631596,thanks very much joshua  let's get into some of the concepts  behind this the opinion had a lot to do
UVob8FMT6Rk,35631596,35636960,really everything to do with this idea  of starry decisis
UVob8FMT6Rk,35636960,35643840,what is starry decisis and why is it  relevant here  well it's the doctrine joshua that says
UVob8FMT6Rk,35643840,35649680,that  the court ordinarily should follow  things decided that is precedent if if a
UVob8FMT6Rk,35649680,35655276,court has made a decision on a case and  the identical issue comes before the  case it should decide the case the same
UVob8FMT6Rk,35655276,35661520,way it's what gives clarity to our law  and allows people to make decisions in  their lives knowing that this law is
UVob8FMT6Rk,35661520,35668320,settled and so to change the law to  change a precedent can happen but it  should only happen if certain factors
UVob8FMT6Rk,35668320,35675596,are present and the court looks at  things like whether the facts and the  law have changed whether people have  relied on the decision whether it has
UVob8FMT6Rk,35675596,35681680,become inconsistent with other law and  whether the rule has proven unworkable  as the dissent points out using those
UVob8FMT6Rk,35681680,35687120,factors there's nothing about roe versus  wade that required it to be changed  today the really the only thing that has
UVob8FMT6Rk,35687120,35692960,changed is the makeup of the court and  for that reason its decision really  flies in the face of this doctrine of
UVob8FMT6Rk,35692960,35699200,starry decisis  looking on our left at some live  pictures of protest outside the colorado
UVob8FMT6Rk,35699200,35705680,state capitol in denver on one end of  civic center park from the denver city  council it's one of the cities
UVob8FMT6Rk,35705680,35711680,where protests are taking place in one  of the states where some abortion  protections have been increased recently
UVob8FMT6Rk,35711680,35718240,colorado's governor jared polis spoke  today about his concerns over roe versus  wade and how the state would do what it
UVob8FMT6Rk,35718240,35724240,could to protect abortion rights there  we're keeping an eye on protests around  the country but professor while we do
UVob8FMT6Rk,35724240,35730080,that another issue in this ruling was  the concept of ordered liberty what does
UVob8FMT6Rk,35730080,35735596,ordered liberty mean and how did that  factor into the opinion
UVob8FMT6Rk,35735596,35741756,well this notion of ordered liberty  comes from this idea called substantive  due process and that is that there are
UVob8FMT6Rk,35741756,35748400,certain fundamental rights that are so  important to us that they cannot be  taken away and among those has been this
UVob8FMT6Rk,35748400,35753840,right to privacy from which the right to  an abortion emanates and the concern is
UVob8FMT6Rk,35753840,35760960,that if this fundamental right goes away  this idea of substantive due process the  foundation on which abortion rights were
UVob8FMT6Rk,35760960,35766160,built then it could also eliminate the  foundation for other rights such as the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35766160,35772240,right to contraception the right to  same-sex marriage the right to intimate  relations in one's own bedroom those
UVob8FMT6Rk,35772240,35778880,none of those things are spelled out or  enumerated in the constitution they're  all built on that same concept of
UVob8FMT6Rk,35778880,35784240,ordered liberty and substantive due  process so the fear is that if the court  is willing to
UVob8FMT6Rk,35784240,35790320,end  the right to an abortion  with uh the  the stroke of a pen it may similarly be
UVob8FMT6Rk,35790320,35796960,willing to end those other rights  now let's get into that before we get  back to the split decisions because in a
UVob8FMT6Rk,35796960,35804800,concurring opinion justice clarence  thomas said clearly that this ruling was  not meant to deal with any of those
UVob8FMT6Rk,35804800,35810560,other cases griswold eisenstadt which  deal with contraception lawrence v texas  which is about
UVob8FMT6Rk,35810560,35816560,sexual privacy and sexual acts  consensual sex a burger fell the hazards  which deals with same-sex marriage and
UVob8FMT6Rk,35816560,35822000,because this case does not deal with  them  he said that's the reason for the court
UVob8FMT6Rk,35822000,35828720,to deal with them he wrote in part let  me bring up the quote he wrote in part  quote we have a duty to correct the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35828720,35833840,error established in those precedents  unquote now perhaps in response to that
UVob8FMT6Rk,35833840,35840800,one of our viewers jill asked very  simply will clarence thomas give up his  right to interracial marriage referring
UVob8FMT6Rk,35840800,35846400,to loving versus virginia in 1967. so  this issue in terms of whether or not we
UVob8FMT6Rk,35846400,35852640,end up going back and whether  everything is on the table because roe  was on the table
UVob8FMT6Rk,35852640,35859200,i'm not sure how to view  that legally in terms of whether or not  that would actually occur but how how do
UVob8FMT6Rk,35859200,35865916,you see it  i think it's a real risk after today's  opinion you know certainly this case is
UVob8FMT6Rk,35865916,35871360,about abortion and so the majority did  not need to answer any of these other  questions about other issues and because
UVob8FMT6Rk,35871360,35876880,those things aren't on the table they  didn't have to decide them but  now i think a state could be emboldened
UVob8FMT6Rk,35876880,35884000,just as mississippi was in this case to  pass a law that says we are going to  eliminate say same-sex marriage we don't
UVob8FMT6Rk,35884000,35889916,want it in our state and it is going to  be a crime for people to get married uh  if they are of the same sex someone
UVob8FMT6Rk,35889916,35895596,would challenge that legally immediately  file a lawsuit saying this violates the  supreme supreme court president in
UVob8FMT6Rk,35895596,35901200,obergefell  and it would work its way up the courts  to the supreme court just as dobbs did
UVob8FMT6Rk,35901200,35906560,and based on today's decision where they  found that there is not this substantive  due process right of privacy in the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35906560,35911756,abortion context  it seems like this same six to three  majority would likely come out the same
UVob8FMT6Rk,35911756,35919120,way in that case so it would take states  actually making these laws and then  lawsuits to be filed but uh i think that
UVob8FMT6Rk,35919120,35925276,we can't have any confidence that those  rights are any longer secure  before i have to let you go very briefly
UVob8FMT6Rk,35925276,35931360,that was something that the chief  justice expressed in his concurring  opinion he did say that this broader
UVob8FMT6Rk,35931360,35938160,move was in his words a serious jolt to  the legal system he kind of said that  the court has a responsibility of
UVob8FMT6Rk,35938160,35945840,judicial restraint of ruling on just  what it needs to rule on for just this  matter let's be clear mississippi broke
UVob8FMT6Rk,35945840,35950880,the law to change the law they passed a  law that they knew violated roe versus
UVob8FMT6Rk,35950880,35956160,wade and planned parenthood v casey and  then through a hail mary and said you  know what let's take the whole thing
UVob8FMT6Rk,35956160,35962320,down and they succeeded and the chief  justice as well as the dissenting  justices said that's very dangerous for
UVob8FMT6Rk,35962320,35967520,the court to do  yeah and you point out correctly that at
UVob8FMT6Rk,35967520,35973680,the time that they argued this case all  they were arguing for is that a 15-week  abortion ban was constitutional it
UVob8FMT6Rk,35973680,35980000,wasn't until amy coney barrett joined  the court that they thought hey you know  what we might be able to go for the home  run ball here and they asked for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35980000,35987520,whole thing to overturn roe versus wade  uh what chief justice roberts is saying  is you you can uphold this dobbs uh the
UVob8FMT6Rk,35987520,35994320,law in mississippi 15 week without  overturning roe versus wade just simply  deciding that after 15 weeks
UVob8FMT6Rk,35994320,36002320,there can be a ban uh instead the court  goes uh the whole hog and i think it is  what um prompts the dissenting justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,36002320,36007520,to say things like uh power not reason  has now become the uh currency for the
UVob8FMT6Rk,36007520,36012720,court in making its decisions  nbc news legal analyst barbara mcquade
UVob8FMT6Rk,36012720,36018640,professor is always good to see you  thank you very much  thanks very much joshua
UVob8FMT6Rk,36018640,36025200,now choosing whether or not to have an  abortion is clearly a deeply personal  decision for some folks it's a moral
UVob8FMT6Rk,36025200,36031436,issue or a religious matter it's also of  course a medical one and today's ruling  could make it significantly more
UVob8FMT6Rk,36031436,36037840,complicated in that regard let's  continue now with dr jamila parrott  she's an ob gyn an abortion provider in
UVob8FMT6Rk,36037840,36042880,washington dc and the president and ceo  of physicians for reproductive health
UVob8FMT6Rk,36042880,36048160,that's an organization that advocates  abortion access dr parrott welcome
UVob8FMT6Rk,36048160,36055040,thank you so much for having me  take us inside some of the conversations  you've been having today what what's
UVob8FMT6Rk,36055040,36061360,been the the mood what's been the the  tenor of them  how are people that you're connected to
UVob8FMT6Rk,36061360,36067680,feeling and doing tonight  we're all devastated you know as  physicians as healthcare providers those
UVob8FMT6Rk,36067680,36074800,who care for our communities we  certainly were not surprised  by this ruling the leaked opinion gave
UVob8FMT6Rk,36074800,36081756,us insight into  what the the justice is intended to do  in terms of eviscerating our our
UVob8FMT6Rk,36081756,36087840,constitutional and our human right to  make decisions about our bodies so this  was not a surprise
UVob8FMT6Rk,36087840,36093276,but certainly it is no less devastating  for those that we care for we know that
UVob8FMT6Rk,36093276,36099200,the right to access abortion care  actually improves the health and  well-being of our computer our
UVob8FMT6Rk,36099200,36104240,communities and so  this ruling is going to have really  long-term effects
UVob8FMT6Rk,36104240,36110480,for those that we care for  give me a sense of how you see and
UVob8FMT6Rk,36110480,36116800,granted this is different from different  places in terms of what women will have  access to what families will have access
UVob8FMT6Rk,36116800,36122560,to  there was a report from pugh charitable  trust that said that at least 20 states  have proposed legislation
UVob8FMT6Rk,36122560,36127756,to ban access to fda-approved abortion  pills we'll talk more about that a
UVob8FMT6Rk,36127756,36133840,little bit later on  but tell us a little bit more about this  about these various options for abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,36133840,36139360,services and how this ruling might  affect them  you're absolutely right this is justice
UVob8FMT6Rk,36139360,36144720,by geography depending on where you live  the zip code you live in the state you
UVob8FMT6Rk,36144720,36151120,live in  you may or may not be able to get this  care as a provider of abortion care
UVob8FMT6Rk,36151120,36158240,myself i practice in in washington dc in  maryland and virginia and the impacts  are going to be very different depending
UVob8FMT6Rk,36158240,36164720,on where i'm working that day when we  think about what it means to access  abortion care in this country even prior
UVob8FMT6Rk,36164720,36171200,to this ruling it is exceedingly  difficult for many people especially  those that have been historically
UVob8FMT6Rk,36171200,36178400,marginalized from care those living on  low incomes communities of color young  people immigrants folks who are unable
UVob8FMT6Rk,36178400,36184960,to travel are are really going to be  disproportionately impacted by  restricting access to this care at the
UVob8FMT6Rk,36184960,36192880,state level  nbc's dasha burns talked to a woman in  michigan about her experience with
UVob8FMT6Rk,36192880,36199752,getting abortion services and the kinds  of conversations she had with her  doctors listen
UVob8FMT6Rk,36200080,36206400,and so my pregnancy was  technically classified as an ectopic  pregnancy but the fetus was implanted on
UVob8FMT6Rk,36206400,36212480,the c-section scar from my previous  delivery from my son they talked through  the fact that some women
UVob8FMT6Rk,36212480,36218400,choose to carry these pregnancies and  typically those pregnancies end in  massive blood loss and hysterectomy but
UVob8FMT6Rk,36218400,36225276,if i wanted to go forward with that  decision it was absolutely my decision  they were clear with me about the  viability of the fetus that
UVob8FMT6Rk,36225276,36230760,i  felt like this tragedy  that my family and i went through was
UVob8FMT6Rk,36230760,36236240,[Music]  disrespected by the choice of the  government and the choice of someone in
UVob8FMT6Rk,36236240,36242240,washington to think that they could  insert themselves into that room with me  into those decisions with my doctor
UVob8FMT6Rk,36242240,36249040,and generally into the grief and pain  that i was going through  [Music]  dr perret talk about the conversations
UVob8FMT6Rk,36249040,36255520,that you have with patients when  thinking through what their options are  i know there are some doctors who are
UVob8FMT6Rk,36255520,36261840,not advocates of abortion services who  would try to counsel a mother maybe not  necessarily in the case of an ectopic
UVob8FMT6Rk,36261840,36267360,pregnancy where the egg implants outside  the uterus but  generally speaking would try to counsel
UVob8FMT6Rk,36267360,36273200,the mother toward prenatal care neonatal  care and guiding her towards having the  baby
UVob8FMT6Rk,36273200,36278720,after all  talk about the conversations that you  have with patients
UVob8FMT6Rk,36279040,36284720,before i do that i just want to say very  clearly that in graduating from medical  school that we've all taken the same
UVob8FMT6Rk,36284720,36290720,oath to first do no harm and allowing  your personal or ideological decisions
UVob8FMT6Rk,36290720,36297596,how you feel to enter into these  conversations is against our medical  ethics organizations like the american
UVob8FMT6Rk,36297596,36304720,college of obgyns and the american  medical association have said very  clearly that it is our responsibility as
UVob8FMT6Rk,36304720,36310560,health care providers to give unbiased  counseling for folks that are seeking  care so when you ask what are the
UVob8FMT6Rk,36310560,36317436,conversations that i have it is just  that what is it does this individual  this pregnant person want and how can i
UVob8FMT6Rk,36317436,36323520,support them with those outcomes if they  are seeking to carry this pregnancy to  term then that is the support that i
UVob8FMT6Rk,36323520,36330160,provide if they are seeking termination  of this pregnancy then that is the  support i provide the important thing to
UVob8FMT6Rk,36330160,36337916,really understand is that this is a  personal decision and it is  exhausting that we are are legislating
UVob8FMT6Rk,36337916,36343040,and litigating medicine when i have  practice for more than 15 years in
UVob8FMT6Rk,36343040,36349436,training to be able to provide this care  and we have folks with no medical  background making unilateral decisions
UVob8FMT6Rk,36349436,36355596,about the health and well-being of our  communities  so these decisions you know they can be  complicated for many people they're
UVob8FMT6Rk,36355596,36360880,straight forward for others there is no  single story the reasons why people seek
UVob8FMT6Rk,36360880,36366000,abortion care are as varied as those  that are seeking services but all want
UVob8FMT6Rk,36366000,36373276,the same thing they want to be able to  make the decision with dignity with  autonomy to have their agency supported
UVob8FMT6Rk,36373276,36379680,and to have the resources that they need  to access this care in a way that is  humane
UVob8FMT6Rk,36379756,36384880,dr jabila parrott i appreciate you  making time for us tonight thank you  very much
UVob8FMT6Rk,36384880,36392240,thank you for having me  next we will hear from advocacy groups  on either side of this issue first how

UVob8FMT6Rk,36579276,36585360,organized and just vote people out  that is just some of the reaction to
UVob8FMT6Rk,36585360,36591916,today's supreme court decision advocates  of abortion rights knew this day could  come but that of course does not make it
UVob8FMT6Rk,36591916,36599360,any easier  clearly it has been a hard day for many  of you too  wendy writes i am 51 years old and have
UVob8FMT6Rk,36599360,36605756,no need for an abortion however this  decision has devastated me this is the  scotus supreme court of the united
UVob8FMT6Rk,36605756,36613436,states and republicans telling women we  don't matter the range of my emotions  today has been outrage sadness and grief
UVob8FMT6Rk,36613436,36619916,determination motivation outright pain  this country is on fire and there seems
UVob8FMT6Rk,36619916,36625200,to be no one able to stop the insanity  in a moment we will speak to an opponent
UVob8FMT6Rk,36625200,36631916,of abortion rights about where that  movement goes from here but let's begin  with jody hicks the president and ceo of
UVob8FMT6Rk,36631916,36637120,planned parenthood affiliates of  california miss hicks welcome good to  see you
UVob8FMT6Rk,36637120,36642560,thank you thanks for having me what is  the conversation been like today among
UVob8FMT6Rk,36642560,36651200,planned parenthood affiliates around the  country clearly this was a day that your  organization must have known could come
UVob8FMT6Rk,36651276,36658800,absolutely i mean unfortunately it's a  day that we've been planning for really  since september when uh sba went into
UVob8FMT6Rk,36658800,36664400,effect in texas and texas started  banning abortions that were at that time  also
UVob8FMT6Rk,36664400,36670320,unconstitutional but the supreme court's  inaction  really um was an action and allowing
UVob8FMT6Rk,36670320,36676800,that to happen and so we created the  future of abortion council here in  california and and created a blueprint
UVob8FMT6Rk,36676800,36683276,for what the state needs to do to  prepare for this very day having said  that you know we've been preparing in
UVob8FMT6Rk,36683276,36688400,terms of policy we have legislation we  have budget investments but on a
UVob8FMT6Rk,36688400,36694000,personal level and certainly from my  colleagues that have been working on  this there's nothing that can prepare  you
UVob8FMT6Rk,36694000,36699360,for a day when the highest court decides  to take away rights that that our many
UVob8FMT6Rk,36699360,36706160,generations have enjoyed that future  generations are will have less rights  than we do and that um decidedly say
UVob8FMT6Rk,36706160,36711360,that um at the point of fertilization  you just don't have the same equal
UVob8FMT6Rk,36711360,36716880,rights as others it's it's impossible to  prepare for
UVob8FMT6Rk,36717040,36723200,i wonder how you're galvanizing for the  next phase of this in terms of the  support you'll need there was a tweet
UVob8FMT6Rk,36723200,36729200,that went out tonight about a half an  hour ago from lizzo the pop star who
UVob8FMT6Rk,36729200,36735436,tweeted i'm pledging a half million  dollars for my upcoming tour to planned  parenthood and abortion rights live
UVob8FMT6Rk,36735436,36741520,nation agreed to match to make it one  million dollars so you've got lizzo's  support tonight that's not the only star
UVob8FMT6Rk,36741520,36747040,who has agreed to put some money behind  abortion rights and abortion access but
UVob8FMT6Rk,36747040,36754720,how much do you think that you will need  whether it's economically or just boots  on the ground or political support to be
UVob8FMT6Rk,36754720,36761916,able to do the work that your  organization needs done  sure i mean i think it's about everyone
UVob8FMT6Rk,36761916,36768720,and and planned parenthood and  independent providers and abortion funds  across the country are rolling up their
UVob8FMT6Rk,36768720,36774160,sleeves today but i think it's important  to really understand the impact of of
UVob8FMT6Rk,36774160,36780800,what today means over half the country  um 13 states by the end of the day will
UVob8FMT6Rk,36780800,36788080,will institute a ban on abortion 26  states when the within the next three  months we're talking about 30 over 30
UVob8FMT6Rk,36788080,36794240,million  women that are affected of reproductive  age we know one in four women need or
UVob8FMT6Rk,36794240,36799596,will seek an abortion in their  reproductive lifetime and so now we have
UVob8FMT6Rk,36799596,36805120,half the country that will have to  travel outside of the state they live in  in order to get care
UVob8FMT6Rk,36805120,36812080,that that affects the trajectory of  their future you know this decision  today really says that you if you live
UVob8FMT6Rk,36812080,36817200,in one of those states you don't have  control over autonomy over your body you
UVob8FMT6Rk,36817200,36824320,don't have agency over decisions that  affect your future and your  opportunities and so it's truly
UVob8FMT6Rk,36824320,36831756,devastating and i think um the how we  wrap our mind around what that means and  what we need to do to ensure that that
UVob8FMT6Rk,36831756,36838800,patients are getting care  when they have to travel outside of the  the zip code that they live in is
UVob8FMT6Rk,36838800,36846080,daunting but it's also  um the work that again we've been doing  here in california um since september
UVob8FMT6Rk,36846080,36852640,and i know other states as well even  today our governor joined force forces  with western states to really
UVob8FMT6Rk,36852640,36857756,decidedly look at what we need to do to  ensure that we're a reproductive freedom
UVob8FMT6Rk,36857756,36863276,west coast coalition  and for those advocates who have been
UVob8FMT6Rk,36863276,36868720,working for this day for a long time who  say that  america is better off with less access
UVob8FMT6Rk,36868720,36876080,to abortions and there are other options  for women  that people should come together on and  try to put those front and center for
UVob8FMT6Rk,36876080,36882640,the sake of healthy families healthy  children for those who say that this  might be a step in the right direction
UVob8FMT6Rk,36882640,36890320,for the country  what would you say to them what do you  want them to know  i would say the data and science speaks
UVob8FMT6Rk,36890320,36897120,for itself  for one our maternal mortality rates in  this country are unconscionable because
UVob8FMT6Rk,36897120,36902320,we don't invest in pregnant people we  don't invest in communities to ensure
UVob8FMT6Rk,36902320,36909040,that people can make decisions about  their families whether or not to have  families in a real way
UVob8FMT6Rk,36909040,36915840,we advocate for things like  family leave and child care and clean  water and all of the things that make it
UVob8FMT6Rk,36915840,36922720,the right community to  make a safe family but also that you  have decisions that affect the outcome
UVob8FMT6Rk,36922720,36930000,of  your very future and we know that taking  away  abortion care as a part of health
UVob8FMT6Rk,36930000,36935840,service a part of decision making that's  between you and a provider that's
UVob8FMT6Rk,36935840,36941360,decision making that's rooted in science  will just increase maternal mortality
UVob8FMT6Rk,36941360,36947040,will just increase people that have less  decisions and less choices and we know
UVob8FMT6Rk,36947040,36953360,that people that don't have access to  those decisions are  much more likely to end up in poverty
UVob8FMT6Rk,36953360,36960560,much more likely to not have economic  and educational opportunities or  decisions that affect the their the
UVob8FMT6Rk,36960560,36966880,outcome of their future and so  um we're really doing everything we can  to ensure that people can get the care
UVob8FMT6Rk,36966880,36972320,that they need um for for any types of  care that they need right now and
UVob8FMT6Rk,36972320,36978000,we need to trust women  jody hicks of planned parenthood of
UVob8FMT6Rk,36978000,36983596,california appreciate you making time  tonight for us thank you very much  thank you very much thank you for having
UVob8FMT6Rk,36983596,36991120,me  as we've been reading your comments  tonight it's worth noting that the vast  majority of them have expressed very
UVob8FMT6Rk,36991120,36997756,strong opposition to this ruling and  they've not all been from women art  writes as a man i'm saddened it is a
UVob8FMT6Rk,36997756,37004480,woman's choice as this physically takes  over her body for nine months men just  contribute a couple of minutes and a few
UVob8FMT6Rk,37004480,37010560,ounces women now have no choice at all  men can choose to walk away
UVob8FMT6Rk,37010560,37015596,miss b tweeted terrified heartbroken  worried for my three teen children's
UVob8FMT6Rk,37015596,37020640,lives what does tomorrow bring how did i  become less than a citizen
UVob8FMT6Rk,37020640,37026160,and luis wrote it's an outrage this  country operates more like a company  that adds and removes rights from its
UVob8FMT6Rk,37026160,37032480,employees rather than a nation it opens  up the risk of other rights like mine to  be married to my husband
UVob8FMT6Rk,37032480,37039916,being taken i'm hurt for women and  couples out there  now today's decision does not stop the
UVob8FMT6Rk,37039916,37045916,anti-abortion rights movement it may  well intensify it today former vice  president mike pence said now is not the
UVob8FMT6Rk,37045916,37052640,time to rest he's effectively calling  for a national abortion ban some people  who demonstrated at the supreme court
UVob8FMT6Rk,37052640,37057680,today seem to agree  i think it'd be great if they just went
UVob8FMT6Rk,37057680,37064000,out straight up banned abortion but it's  not the case for every single state so i  think we are going to start like start
UVob8FMT6Rk,37064000,37069756,seeing a lot more  um  things going through all i know is that
UVob8FMT6Rk,37069756,37076880,every child deserves life  human rights happen human rights start  at conception and end at natural death
UVob8FMT6Rk,37076880,37083680,and that is what i'm going to fight for  until the day that i die  [Music]  let's continue now with brooke paz she
UVob8FMT6Rk,37083680,37090960,is the government affairs coordinator  for students for life action a group  that trains young people in  anti-abortion advocacy ms paz welcome
UVob8FMT6Rk,37090960,37097120,good to have you with us  thanks so much for having me  so i'm sure that your organization did
UVob8FMT6Rk,37097120,37102480,not plan to disband after this ruling  came what is the next move for you and
UVob8FMT6Rk,37102480,37110160,for your group  absolutely this is really the beginning  for us um we are of course celebrating
UVob8FMT6Rk,37110160,37115276,today we're so excited about this ruling  this is a day that we hoped would come
UVob8FMT6Rk,37115276,37120480,but i think it came sooner than we  expected and from here on out we are
UVob8FMT6Rk,37120480,37125520,going to continue working on both the  federal level and in the states to pass
UVob8FMT6Rk,37125520,37130640,as many pieces of legislation as  possible to protect all human life from
UVob8FMT6Rk,37130640,37136880,conception to natural death and also to  support women so that they can  confidently choose life whether that is
UVob8FMT6Rk,37136880,37142560,through parenting or adoption  there are a lot of heartbroken people
UVob8FMT6Rk,37142560,37149276,tonight who are very worried about what  this might mean including some who have  some rather visceral personal stories to
UVob8FMT6Rk,37149276,37156880,share one of our viewers wrote i was the  product of parents who desperately did  not want another child i was made very
UVob8FMT6Rk,37156880,37163520,well aware throughout my life that i was  unwanted it's a miserable way to live
UVob8FMT6Rk,37163520,37169360,i wonder miss paz how much empathy you  have for people  who feel like they've had their hearts
UVob8FMT6Rk,37169360,37175200,stepped on today and like they've had  their rights abridged today
UVob8FMT6Rk,37175360,37182400,i'm very sad for women who have been  told by the abortion industry and  pro-abortion legislators that they need
UVob8FMT6Rk,37182400,37187436,abortion to succeed in life they need  abortion to be equal they need to kill
UVob8FMT6Rk,37187436,37192480,their child in order to achieve their  dreams and goals that's simply not true
UVob8FMT6Rk,37192480,37197916,that's anti-women  and it's the opposite of progressive
UVob8FMT6Rk,37197916,37205040,we know that women don't need abortion  to do the things that they hope to do in  their lives and really these women have
UVob8FMT6Rk,37205040,37210880,nothing to fear the pro-life community  has been here for years decades really
UVob8FMT6Rk,37210880,37217756,providing free resources support um and  compassionate care to women who need it
UVob8FMT6Rk,37217756,37224160,and we're going to continue to do that  like i said this is just the beginning  for us  that's why pregnancy resource centers
UVob8FMT6Rk,37224160,37229520,and pro-life organizations across the  country exist we're here not only to  help
UVob8FMT6Rk,37229520,37235596,save babies but to help women as well  because they deserve  better care than abortion abortion is
UVob8FMT6Rk,37235596,37241756,harmful to them they deserve to know  that  so many women that we come across and  who now work in the pro-life movement or
UVob8FMT6Rk,37241756,37249360,volunteer the pro-life movement have  gone through with abortions even men too  and have suffered from physical and
UVob8FMT6Rk,37249360,37255680,emotional repercussions sometimes for  decades before they find healing and
UVob8FMT6Rk,37255680,37261840,they really deserve better than that i  myself am the product of an adoption and
UVob8FMT6Rk,37261840,37267916,if my grandmother my biological  grandmother had not chosen life  i would not have the wonderful family i
UVob8FMT6Rk,37267916,37275840,have today my dad was adopted by a man  from mexico and a woman from poland who  went through the holocaust and um if if
UVob8FMT6Rk,37275840,37281756,my biological grandmother hadn't chosen  life they wouldn't have had a wonderful  son who is now my wonderful father and i
UVob8FMT6Rk,37281756,37287120,wouldn't have my sisters so  we all have stories and they're all  important
UVob8FMT6Rk,37287120,37292400,well as we look at these pictures from  new york city i believe these are  protesters making their way north from
UVob8FMT6Rk,37292400,37299040,washington square to union square but  here in manhattan i hear you in terms of  your personal story and about how this
UVob8FMT6Rk,37299040,37304720,has affected you directly when you talk  about compassionate care i have to say i  didn't really hear
UVob8FMT6Rk,37304720,37310960,any compassion and i think it's worth  noting that most abortion services when  provided under the care of a doctor are
UVob8FMT6Rk,37310960,37316800,really quite safe and have very few  complications pregnancies can cause  dramatic complications and in this
UVob8FMT6Rk,37316800,37322080,country depending on who you are and  what color you are  the risk of dying in pregnancy or during
UVob8FMT6Rk,37322080,37327360,childbirth is is really quite high  is there nowhere to go in terms of your
UVob8FMT6Rk,37327360,37333520,organization  finding a meeting of the minds with what  appear to be majorities of americans who
UVob8FMT6Rk,37333520,37340560,don't see things your way  i would argue that the majority of  americans do see it our way in fact
UVob8FMT6Rk,37340560,37346320,polling shows that no i'm sorry the  latest polls including our nbc news  polls show that about 61 percent of
UVob8FMT6Rk,37346320,37352960,americans do not support what the  supreme court did today so i hate to  differ with you but i don't think you're  correct
UVob8FMT6Rk,37352960,37360320,polling from this year  shows that the majority of americans  want significant limits on abortion and
UVob8FMT6Rk,37360320,37367276,even the majority of millennials and gen  z who we specifically polled when they  learn what roe v wade allows abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,37367276,37372320,through all nine months of pregnancy for  any reason they oppose that in fact i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,37372320,37378080,sorry ms but our polling is from this  month and i trust our pollsters at nbc  and that's not the point of the question
UVob8FMT6Rk,37378080,37384080,let's let's bear in mind excuse me  excuse me that is not the point no no  because you're you're getting off track
UVob8FMT6Rk,37384080,37390640,and my time is limited and i want to  hear you out but the point of my  question is  there's got to be a way forward on this
UVob8FMT6Rk,37390640,37397200,there's got to be a way for people who  say very strongly the people who are in  the streets right now in new york and la
UVob8FMT6Rk,37397200,37404720,and denver and at the supreme court and  and everywhere else in this country  to find some kind of way forward with
UVob8FMT6Rk,37404720,37409916,organizations like yours because  abortions aren't going to stop just  because states may ban them i'm
UVob8FMT6Rk,37409916,37415840,wondering if you've contemplated a path  forward particularly for people who are  determined to seek abortion services
UVob8FMT6Rk,37415840,37423200,that's what i'm wondering and i know our  time is short but that's what i'm  wondering about  the root of the issue is that what we're
UVob8FMT6Rk,37423200,37428320,talking about is a human life that is  created at the moment of conception
UVob8FMT6Rk,37428320,37435520,unique dna that is a human life that is  worthy of protection equal to any other  human being and like i said i do have
UVob8FMT6Rk,37435520,37442320,compassion for these women that's why  we're here we're here to help women and  children and the majority of people
UVob8FMT6Rk,37442320,37449916,recognize that life begins in the womb  and that is deserving of protection  going forward we need to be encouraging
UVob8FMT6Rk,37449916,37456640,women that they do not need abortion to  succeed because that is a lie and  abortion not only ends the life of a
UVob8FMT6Rk,37456640,37462720,human child  but also harms a woman physically  emotionally mentally and she deserves
UVob8FMT6Rk,37462720,37468880,better than that that is true compassion  that's the truth and science backs that  up
UVob8FMT6Rk,37469360,37475276,i'm sorry ms pogg you're saying some  things about abortion in terms of its  medical impacts that are questionable  and i think the wall street journal
UVob8FMT6Rk,37475276,37480400,north pole that we just showed shows  that there are very different views on  this than the one you're espousing but
UVob8FMT6Rk,37480400,37486400,you are entitled to your view and for  today the supreme court has seen it your  way i do appreciate you making time to
UVob8FMT6Rk,37486400,37492720,talk to us about this brook paws of  students for life action thank you very  much for making time we appreciate it
UVob8FMT6Rk,37492720,37499840,thank you  clearly america's fight over abortion  access is not over so where does it go

UVob8FMT6Rk,37580560,37585680,some of the senators who voted to  confirm president trump's nominees for  the supreme court say they feel
UVob8FMT6Rk,37585680,37592640,blindsided by today's decision  democratic senator joe manchin of west  virginia says he trusted justices
UVob8FMT6Rk,37592640,37599040,gorsuch and kavanaugh when they  testified that roe v wade was settled  law he says that this ruling the ruling
UVob8FMT6Rk,37599040,37606240,that came out today rejects stability  enjoyed by the past two generations of  americans similarly republican senator
UVob8FMT6Rk,37606240,37612480,susan collins of maine said the decision  comes when the country is desperate for  stability republican senator lisa
UVob8FMT6Rk,37612480,37619276,murkowski of alaska said quote  in the wake of this ruling it is up to  congress to respond
UVob8FMT6Rk,37619276,37624640,joining us now to talk through what that  response might be our former democratic  secretary of housing and urban
UVob8FMT6Rk,37624640,37632080,development julian castro and former  republican congressman carlos corbello  both are msnbc political analysts good
UVob8FMT6Rk,37632080,37637680,to have you both with us and i wonder  first of all carlos corbello let me  start with you the shock from some
UVob8FMT6Rk,37637680,37643200,members of the senate i think is reading  some abortion rights advocates as
UVob8FMT6Rk,37643200,37649520,naivete if not foolishness that they  would be so  credulous that they would not go for
UVob8FMT6Rk,37649520,37655360,this ruling i think you've got a lot of  angry people who are saying this is what  we knew was going to happen tonight so
UVob8FMT6Rk,37655360,37662080,where does this go from here politically  well i think that's right joshua the  conservative movement in america has
UVob8FMT6Rk,37662080,37668080,been dreaming and promising this day to  its supporters for decades and it's  finally here and i don't think it should
UVob8FMT6Rk,37668080,37675916,surprise any of the senators who voted  for any of the justices that made this  decision possible uh that uh that they
UVob8FMT6Rk,37675916,37682800,went ahead and did this when uh  republican senators and uh others  involved in choosing and confirming
UVob8FMT6Rk,37682800,37688640,nominees have always said that this was  one of the big goals of the movement and  sure enough here we are it really
UVob8FMT6Rk,37688640,37695436,shouldn't be a surprise after donald  trump was able to replace ruth bader  ginsburg with amy comey barrett a
UVob8FMT6Rk,37695436,37701200,conservative justice  secretary castro i wonder what your  sense is as we're continuing to look at
UVob8FMT6Rk,37701200,37707680,live pictures at protests from across  the country of where this goes from here  we mentioned the republican senators who
UVob8FMT6Rk,37707680,37713680,expressed dissatisfaction congresswoman  liz cheney made it clear that she has  always been pro-life so clearly there
UVob8FMT6Rk,37713680,37719756,has been movement for this for some time  what do you think we might see either in
UVob8FMT6Rk,37719756,37726000,congress in state houses  what's the next step here particularly  for people who are upset about the way
UVob8FMT6Rk,37726000,37733916,that this ruling went  well i think that two things have to  happen in the long run which is that we
UVob8FMT6Rk,37733916,37739916,need to codify row and also need to look  at restructuring the supreme court i  mean this supreme court several
UVob8FMT6Rk,37739916,37745120,appointees of whom were appointed by  presidents that did not win the popular  vote democrats have won seven of the
UVob8FMT6Rk,37745120,37750320,last eight presidential popular votes uh  and where senator mcconnell has played
UVob8FMT6Rk,37750320,37756240,games with the ability of a democratic  president to make an appointment that  would have changed could have changed
UVob8FMT6Rk,37756240,37763436,an outcome like this  and so we need to fundamentally look at  reform but in the shorter term
UVob8FMT6Rk,37763436,37770240,there's november  and i believe that this is going to  mobilize wake up galvanize a whole bunch
UVob8FMT6Rk,37770240,37776320,of people who may have been sitting on  the sidelines for november because  midterms are you know
UVob8FMT6Rk,37776320,37782320,infamously more difficult to get the  base out for i think the base is going  to get out more in the democratic party
UVob8FMT6Rk,37782320,37789360,and especially in suburban communities  in some of these swing congressional  districts and swing senate seats um
UVob8FMT6Rk,37789360,37796000,overall for states you're going to see a  lot more mobilization there against  republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,37796160,37802640,i wonder about that congressman because  i feel like there's going to be  mobilization potentially in both  directions i mean we heard today from
UVob8FMT6Rk,37802640,37809596,lucy who tweeted i am a conservative  republican woman who supports a woman's  right to choose one should not lump all
UVob8FMT6Rk,37809596,37816000,republicans into one group any more than  to say all democrats are radical  socialists this is a women's issue not a
UVob8FMT6Rk,37816000,37822400,red or blue one there are many  republican women like me  i wonder how you see the future of this
UVob8FMT6Rk,37822400,37828480,it feels like this could be galvanizing  on both sides of the aisle and we know  how much midterm elections are about
UVob8FMT6Rk,37828480,37835596,about bringing out the base with those  kind of red meat issues that people are  very impassioned about
UVob8FMT6Rk,37835596,37841680,well joshua i agree with uh secretary  castro and i think we're going to see  the greatest political impact
UVob8FMT6Rk,37841680,37848080,of this ruling is in swing states and  swing districts a lot of people are  worried about the states where abortion
UVob8FMT6Rk,37848080,37855200,might be completely outlawed those are  fairly conservative states i don't know  that politicians there will face any
UVob8FMT6Rk,37855200,37860240,peril or risk but in swing districts and  swing states particularly in suburban
UVob8FMT6Rk,37860240,37867120,america where republicans have been  making a lot of gains after getting beat  there pretty badly in 2018 and even in
UVob8FMT6Rk,37867120,37872480,2020 that's where this could be  difficult for some republican candidates
UVob8FMT6Rk,37872480,37879040,that represent these suburban districts  where there are a lot of women who  perhaps on  fiscal issues are more conservative but
UVob8FMT6Rk,37879040,37884800,on some of these social issues like  abortion are more centrist or liberal  republicans risk
UVob8FMT6Rk,37884800,37891916,losing  some of those voters that have been  gravitating towards them in advance of  the 2022 elections in in according to
UVob8FMT6Rk,37891916,37898480,many polls  secretary castro i should note that you  know we've had this
UVob8FMT6Rk,37898480,37904160,bill this uh comprehensive uh bipartisan  bipartisan safer communities act  for
UVob8FMT6Rk,37904160,37910080,gun violence prevention that passed the  house today we just learned from the  white house that the president will sign
UVob8FMT6Rk,37910080,37917200,this bill into law  tomorrow morning he's planning to sign  it around 8 30 a.m eastern time before
UVob8FMT6Rk,37917200,37923120,he leaves for elm for schlosselman  germany which is where the g7 summit  will be so we'll have coverage of that
UVob8FMT6Rk,37923120,37929680,tomorrow here and on your nbc station  and on the app it seems like we just had  a moment where democrats and republicans
UVob8FMT6Rk,37929680,37937040,got something done together that we have  been waiting for for a really long time  and now almost on cue we have something
UVob8FMT6Rk,37937040,37943916,that instantly polarizes us we get a lot  of things we got to do right now between  the economy gun violence prevention the
UVob8FMT6Rk,37943916,37949436,earth being on fire etc before i let you  go very briefly what does this mean for
UVob8FMT6Rk,37949436,37955040,our ability to get stuff done right now  well look i think for
UVob8FMT6Rk,37955040,37960800,especially a lot of progressives the  legislation that was passed by the  senate and the house and will be signed
UVob8FMT6Rk,37960800,37967436,by the president is a good first step i  think it is something  you know it doesn't meet the  expectations i don't think completely of
UVob8FMT6Rk,37967436,37973520,what folks want it to be done but it  shows that there can be progress this is  the most significant legislation on
UVob8FMT6Rk,37973520,37978560,common sense gun reform that we've had  in a very long time  so hopefully that
UVob8FMT6Rk,37978560,37984640,muscle of bipartisanship will be  exercised a little bit and get a little  bit stronger and and there can be more
UVob8FMT6Rk,37984640,37990400,that gets done along these lines and  other important issues but you're right  joshua i mean you know it kind of gets
UVob8FMT6Rk,37990400,37996880,overshadowed by what happened it does  get overshadowed by what happened today  uh with roe and what this is going to
UVob8FMT6Rk,37996880,38002560,mean to the  the  livelihood the quality of life uh the
UVob8FMT6Rk,38002560,38008000,the risks that  uh women face across the country because
UVob8FMT6Rk,38008000,38015040,of this supreme court's retro grade  decision  on abortion and it also leaves a lot of
UVob8FMT6Rk,38015040,38021360,people feeling like what in the world we  went to go vote uh democrats wanted  right right the presidency and both
UVob8FMT6Rk,38021360,38027040,houses of congress but we still get this  kind of result  we shall see where we go from here
UVob8FMT6Rk,38027040,38032240,julian castro and carlos corbello good  to see you both thank you both very much  thank you for making time for us please
UVob8FMT6Rk,38032240,38040916,keep sending us your thoughts and  questions but until we meet again i'm  joshua johnson stay safe this weekend  i'll see you monday good night
