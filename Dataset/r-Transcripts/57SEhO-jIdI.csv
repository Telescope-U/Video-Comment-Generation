57SEhO-jIdI,21675,26890,I want to see the what you saw
57SEhO-jIdI,28212,32377,How am I supposed to appear now?
57SEhO-jIdI,32379,35746,How am I supposed to smile now?
57SEhO-jIdI,38886,42256,Someone’s ideal of ‘normal’
57SEhO-jIdI,42998,45952,Or the anomaly that created that ‘normal’
57SEhO-jIdI,47215,50618,Where do you fit into this?
57SEhO-jIdI,50618,54287,"C’mon, let me hear your voice a bit more"
57SEhO-jIdI,55604,58963,If my indulgence
57SEhO-jIdI,58963,62965,Was too much
57SEhO-jIdI,62965,67233,Then this hand of yours that I hold
57SEhO-jIdI,67233,72100,And your warmth Are the answer
57SEhO-jIdI,72101,75140,Touch me just a little bit more
57SEhO-jIdI,75140,79263,This urge in my heart is so selfish
57SEhO-jIdI,79263,84290,If the world is on the brink
57SEhO-jIdI,84290,87401,Then let’s love the oblivion
57SEhO-jIdI,87641,89512,I do a-ya-ya-ya
57SEhO-jIdI,89512,92196,It’s helpless That much is obvious
57SEhO-jIdI,92196,93563,(a-ya-ya-ya)

57SEhO-jIdI,102028,105652,Are we partners in crime? Betrayal Game
57SEhO-jIdI,105652,107774,Just like a teacher and a student before a test
57SEhO-jIdI,107774,109834,"Blink once for yes, twice for no"
57SEhO-jIdI,109834,111843,Gently swaying with an air of wanton lust
57SEhO-jIdI,111843,114005,"Tell me, where do we go from here?"
57SEhO-jIdI,114005,116339,Your vague words muddy the waters
57SEhO-jIdI,116339,118437,There you go - running from your dreams
57SEhO-jIdI,118437,120537,"“Leave me alone, don’t leave me alone”"
57SEhO-jIdI,120538,122300,I won’t play the closure game
57SEhO-jIdI,122301,125726,If your gaze
57SEhO-jIdI,125726,129800,Isn’t real - just a throwaway
57SEhO-jIdI,129800,134103,Then I’ve seen it many times
