kMtN9KJHn5Y,9309,10777,Welcome to my first video.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,10877,12679,"Yo, what's up, guys? It's Marques Brownlee here..."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,12779,13780,...from MKBHD.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,13880,15148, ...reviewing tech...
kMtN9KJHn5Y,15248,16282,Recommend this very highly.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,16382,17650,Back with another HD video.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,17750,19019, ...and making  YouTube videos...
kMtN9KJHn5Y,19119,21388,Marques: I uploaded 102 videos.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,21488,23223, ...and the camera  that I choose to do this with
kMtN9KJHn5Y,23323,25291, has always been  really important with me.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,25391,28261,- C200. - Red Weapon.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,28361,30196, But if you want to know  where my love for cameras
kMtN9KJHn5Y,30296,32632," and making videos  really comes from,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,32731,36336, you'll have to go all the way  back to the beginning
kMtN9KJHn5Y,36436,38505, to the very first VHS
kMtN9KJHn5Y,38605,42675, handheld portable  camera ever.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,42775,46513, I'm Marques Brownlee  and I review dope new tech.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,46613,49516," But on this show,  I'm rewinding the clock"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,49616,51651, to discover  the tech of the past
kMtN9KJHn5Y,51751,53820, that changed  our lives forever.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,55654,58792," This is ""Retro Tech:  Camcorder."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,58892,60359,"Yo, what's up, guys? You know, we do a lot"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,60460,63263,"of cool pieces of retro tech on this show,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,63363,65297,a lot of which I don't have much of a connection to
kMtN9KJHn5Y,65398,66633,because it was before my time.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,66733,69169,And even though I didn't start making my videos
kMtN9KJHn5Y,69269,72438,"until 25 years after this camera came out,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,72539,75075,I still owe a lot of what I do now to this.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,76575,81714,The revolutionary JVC GR-C1 came out in 1984
kMtN9KJHn5Y,81814,85085,as the world's first all-in-one VHS camcorder.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,85185,88787,"So, before this, video cameras were pretty much strictly for professionals,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,88888,91858,but the small form factor and ease of use
kMtN9KJHn5Y,91958,94427,made everyone want to be the director of their own home movies.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,94527,96329,"All right, let's go ahead and take a look"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,96429,98231,at what came in the original box
kMtN9KJHn5Y,98331,99299,and try to fire it up.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,99399,101568,I'm pretty excited for it.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,101668,103636,And there it is.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,103736,106706,( inhales ) They all have this sort of retro smell.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,106806,108274,I think it's just mostly old leather.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,108374,109876,"Anyway, some paperwork."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,109976,113546,"Wow, the original purchaser in 1985."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,113646,117417,"$1,717. Wow."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,117517,120753,"Up here, RF converter."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,120853,122489,"Retro battery, for sure."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,122589,124457,Blank tapes.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,124557,126559,A large power brick.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,126659,129562,Red and black. Nice color scheme.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,129662,132465,Viewfinder.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,132565,134200,"All right, the actual camera itself,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,134300,138771,the JVC GR-C1 in the flesh.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,139772,141474,"Okay, this is serious,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,141574,142642,but look at all the things
kMtN9KJHn5Y,142742,144377,we have to put together to use it.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,144477,146546,I might have to look at the instructions.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,147813,149215,"A lot of tech today,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,149315,150216,we just throw out the instructions
kMtN9KJHn5Y,150316,151450,"as soon as we get something,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,151551,152918,but this would not be the case
kMtN9KJHn5Y,153019,155855,if you got the first ever portable VHS camera.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,155955,157557,You'd have to actually read through them.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,157657,159726,The viewfinder's gonna go on the front right there.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,159826,160894,Where's it plug in?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,160994,163363,User manual says-- there we go.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,163463,164931,Battery should be pretty simple.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,167333,169736,"Okay, so it's definitely not simple."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,174773,176508,This is already giving me Dad camera vibes.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,178244,180880,"Say, ""Cheese,"" kids. There you go."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,180980,183483,"What is it with us getting ""STD"" on all these--"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,183583,184784,"maybe that's something about the '80s,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,184884,186819,"but they just willingly print ""STD"""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,186919,188688,on the side of electronics here.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,188788,191323,"But I think this is, uh, ""standard"" white balance."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,191424,193493,Power button.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,193593,195728,Did that just turn on?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,195828,197864,"Oh, my God, it just turned on."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,199865,201668,I'll pop a cassette tape in there.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,201768,203870,Might as well.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,203970,207473,- Eject button. - ( whirring )
kMtN9KJHn5Y,207573,210577,"Wow, what a noise that makes."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,212478,214247,"""Then press the Start/Stop switch,"""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,214347,215481,which is my thumb button.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,215581,218450,"Oh, boy, here we go."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,218551,220887,"Man, I'm unfocused."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,220987,223423,And it is definitely recording.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,223523,224590,"Ooh, there's my zoom. Wow."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,225591,226726,"Oh, hey."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,226826,229362,This is great.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,229462,232832,"I have literally no idea if this'll be in focus,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,232932,235668,but ready to learn a little more about this camera?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,235768,237337,Let's get it.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,237437,238938," Okay, so,  for the next few days,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,239038,241374, I'm going to take  the JVC Camcorder with me
kMtN9KJHn5Y,241474,242742, and learn everything  there is to know
kMtN9KJHn5Y,242842,245612, about this iconic  piece of tech.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,245712,247880,"- Hi, I'm Marques. - Hi, I'm Jess."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,247980,249448,"Great to meet you, Jess. So, I'm gonna start"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,249549,251651,by asking you to check underneath your chair.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,251751,253253,"- Are we-- it's like   ""Oprah"" right now? - Yeah."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,254887,257489,"- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, man."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,257590,259259,"So, we're time traveling, is what we're doing."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,259359,260660,Marques: We're going back.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,260760,262428,This is beautiful.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,262528,264464,"We're making movies, dude. Right now."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,264564,265965,"You're making a movie, I'm making a movie."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,266065,269569,I'm recording you right now.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,269669,273439,"""Doc, Doc! You made a time machine out of a DeLorean?"""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,273539,277277,I've been waiting 30 years to say that.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,277377,278878,"Marques: Okay, so, before we get into the camcorder,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,278978,280445,I want to take it all the way back to the beginning.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,280546,282914,"If you wanted to see a movie in the '70s and '80s,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,283015,285618,you had to actually go to a movie theater.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,285718,287754,What was that like?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,287854,289756,"Roberson:  In the early '70s, if you  wanted to watch a movie,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,289856,291556, there was only one place  you could go.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,291657,293660,You had to go to a movie theater.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,293760,296963,"Misty: If someone missed  a theater run of something,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,297063,299399,they may very well may not see the movie ever
kMtN9KJHn5Y,299499,301934, because there was  no home video market.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,302034,304570," People couldn't  just buy a movie,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,304670,305838," bring it home,  and watch it."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,305938,308341,You couldn't stream anything.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,308441,309976,Sounds terrible.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,312544,314881,"Shafer:  But then all of the sudden,  there was a push"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,314981,316749,to bring films into your home.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,316849,320753,Roberson:  And that gave rise  to VCRs and VHS.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,320853,322955,"Home video is in, and it seems like"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,323055,325324,"it happened overnight, this video revolution."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,325425,327860,Shafer:  People could just watch what  they wanted when they wanted.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,327960,329662," It changed the way people  consumed media,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,329762,331931,and that was just super revolutionary.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,332031,336803,"But when JVC put out their camera,  it changed everything."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,336903,340640,Announcer: A video camera and VHS recorder all in one.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,340740,343776,The JVC was revolutionary because it was accessible.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,343876,346012, People now are part of
kMtN9KJHn5Y,346112,348815, the movie-going  and movie-creating culture.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,348915,351884,Reporter: Video cameras are now small enough to cradle like violins.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,351984,355755,"Before that JVC came out, in order to shoot video,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,355855,359926," it was this  extremely cumbersome,  involved process."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,360026,361728,You'd have to be a professional making a movie
kMtN9KJHn5Y,361828,363496, or you'd be working  for the news.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,363596,365031,I think I can only make the reference
kMtN9KJHn5Y,365131,366866," to that scene in ""Commando"""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,366966,368401, when Schwarzenegger  is about to attack the beach
kMtN9KJHn5Y,368501,370436,"and he's, like, putting on all of this gear."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,370536,371971," It was like that--  battery packs,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,372071,375475," and the VCR, and the camera."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,375575,379746,"It was multiple parts, and it was very hard for anyone to carry."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,379846,384517,The JVC allowed people to take video production
kMtN9KJHn5Y,384617,385985," and have it  in their own hands,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,386085,389856, then be a director  of their own film.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,389956,392557,It was epic.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,392658,394427,Marques:  The JVC camcorder  turned everyone
kMtN9KJHn5Y,394527,397430, into the director  of their own home movie.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,397530,398998, So I've invited  a special guest
kMtN9KJHn5Y,399098,402602, to help me try to make my first video using the GR-C1.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,402702,403870,"Casey, welcome back."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,403970,405605,- Good to be here. - Thanks for being here.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,405705,407406,"I don't know if you know what we're looking at right now,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,407507,409675,but I'm kind of wondering if this brings back any memories.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,409775,412011,"That is the nicest way anyone's ever called me an old man before, Marques..."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,412111,414046,"- Yeah, no problem. - ...in my entire life."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,414146,417784,"Marques:  Casey Neistat puts the word  ""maker"" in filmmaker."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,417884,420520,Neistat: I said yes to every opportunity that involved picking up a camera.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,420620,422087,Marques: He's a prolific  YouTube creator...
kMtN9KJHn5Y,422188,424656,The majority of my videos are shot on portable cameras...
kMtN9KJHn5Y,424757,426992," ...man of many talents  and a lot of gear,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,427093,430962, and the perfect person  to help me put this JVC  camcorder into action.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,431063,433599,"This doesn't bring back memories,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,433699,435134,- it brings back nightmares. - Okay.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,435234,437837,The first videos I ever edited
kMtN9KJHn5Y,437937,440573,were using the camcorder as one deck
kMtN9KJHn5Y,440673,442642,"and a VCR as the other deck,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,442742,445044,trying to edit between machines.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,445144,447513,That was the last time I laid eyes on one of these.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,447613,452018,"So, my first camera I ever bought with my own money shot to SD cards."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,452118,453886,It was a little Sanyo Xacti camera.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,453986,455521, Shooting with it  was super easy because
kMtN9KJHn5Y,455621,458224,"I'd just start/stop, get my clips, import, edit."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,458324,460693,Am I here because of my advanced age?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,460793,463229,"Uh, you're here because of your experience"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,463329,465164,in the world of video production.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,465264,467233,- Appreciate how nice   you were with that. - Yeah.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,467333,468935,"So, this camcorder came out in a time"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,469035,471871,where personal video wasn't really a thing yet.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,471971,474874,What we're gonna try to do is make a how-to video--
kMtN9KJHn5Y,474974,477977,"dos and don'ts of being a YouTuber, but 1980s style."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,478077,480580,"- Let's do it. But, Marques? - Yeah?"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,480680,482682,You're dressed like it's 2019.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,482782,485518,We gotta take this just one level further.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,485618,487253,"- Marques: This is, uh-- - You got it."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,487353,488921,I'm starting to feel older.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,489021,490623, ( music playing )
kMtN9KJHn5Y,492925,494227,Are we gonna stand in front of this?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,494327,495695,I think we should stand.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,495795,497763,- Just lift there. - Standing height.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,497863,500066,That's as wide as it gets?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,500166,502068,We're gonna have to be further than I thought.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,502168,503803,I think it's recording.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,503903,505571,Is it blinking? Check the manual.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,505671,508107,"- It's both. - Well, record."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,508207,510576,"- Okay. - ""To start..."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,510676,512878,"""While holding the record button pressed..."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,512979,514714,The tape's not going around and around.

kMtN9KJHn5Y,516015,517083,"""Press the Start/Stop switch."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,517182,518885,"So, I'm gonna hit ""Record."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,518985,521120,"- Oh, it's spinning. - And it's recording."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,521219,522988,- It's turning. - Amazing. Okay.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,523089,525224,- We found the record button. - We found the record button.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,527059,528261,Marques: That's-- that's frame.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,528361,530830,"So, you go over this way a little bit."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,530930,531931,Do you look like you're in the middle?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,532031,533299,Move over a little bit. I think--
kMtN9KJHn5Y,533399,536836,- Does that feel middle? - Uh...
kMtN9KJHn5Y,539004,541641,"- Oh, yeah. - Okay, perfect."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,541741,544210,"- Okay. - Cool, okay."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,544310,546679,"- So, my name is Marques. - My name's Casey."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,546779,548781,Come along with us on this journey.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,548881,549915,"I feel like that's how they talked in, like, in commercials in the--"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,550016,551149,"Yeah, yeah. Cool."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,551250,553886,- Action! - Hello.

kMtN9KJHn5Y,1075641,1077576,"Good job, tape. You're dope."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1079477,1081146,Marques:  The JVC camcorder
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1081246,1083115," inspired a generation  of content creators,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1083215,1085818, and electronics companies  all wanted in on the action.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1085918,1087619, Soon the market  would be flooded
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1087719,1090856, with smaller and sleeker  camcorder models.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1090956,1093525,"Robison:  The JVC camcorder  was a huge hit,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1093625,1095360,and that just made other companies
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1095460,1097096,that much more eager to try and see
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1097196,1098630, if they could make  something better.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1098730,1100165,Misty:  Sony was making one.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1100265,1101500, Panasonic was making one.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1101600,1102835, They were all just  hoping to get
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1102935,1104536, their corner  of this marketplace.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1104636,1107739," Things became lighter,  easier to use, smaller."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1107839,1110542,And then digital came about.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1110642,1112877,"Man: Now, this is the wave of the future right here."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1112978,1114813,Reporter: All the whiz-bang production techniques
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1114913,1116682,that Hollywood studios use
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1116782,1118183,at a fraction of the cost.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1118283,1120284,The camcorder reached a plateau
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1120385,1122554,where there was just no making it any better
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1122654,1126225,while it was still for VHS tapes.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1126325,1127693,Marques:  So even though the retro look
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1127793,1130695," of the JVC camcorder  might seem outdated,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1130796,1134867, it's clear to me  that our content-obsessed  generation now
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1134967,1137569, owes a lot  to this piece of tech.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1137669,1139538,What's the legacy of this JVC camera?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1139638,1142141,Goldstein:  Everybody whose phone  has a camera on it
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1142241,1146411,is a beneficiary of the JVC camcorder.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1146511,1149580, And you can absolutely  see the legacy of that
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1149681,1152918,in today's YouTube stars shooting things
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1153018,1155586, from their own lives  in real time
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1155687,1158690,with very little technology and equipment.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1158790,1160826,Schafer:  And we live in a time  with infinite amount
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1160926,1162528, of user-generated content.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1162628,1163929,"But if you think about it,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1164029,1166765, the very first visual  user-generated content
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1166865,1168433," that was massively accessible,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1168533,1170669,it exists because of the VHS camcorder.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1170769,1174239,Misty:  People wanted to see  real-life stuff.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1174339,1178744,"Without this camera, there would be no YouTube."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1178844,1181813,"- You'd be out of a job. - Yeah, that's exactly right."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1181913,1185617,"Roberson:  So, the legacy  of the JVC camcorder"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1185717,1188287,is a reminder that we have the ability
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1188387,1190856,to decide for ourselves what are important stories.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1193491,1195861," The JVC camcorder allowed  people to justify,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1195961,1198931,"""Yes, my life is important. My stories are important."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1199031,1201533,"- ...the big   2,000 subscriber mark. - Thanks for watching."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1201633,1203368,"""And my desire to share it with people"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1203468,1204603,"is equally as important."""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1204703,1205804,Talk to you guys on the next one.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1208906,1211276,"What's up, guys? Thank you for watching."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1211376,1214746,"I learned a lot about this OG JVC camcorder,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1214846,1216514,"and I gotta say, I have a lot more respect now"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1216615,1219751,for people who truly mastered this thing.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1219851,1221286,"And it wasn't easy,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1221386,1223288,but we have actually edited the video
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1223388,1224956,that Casey and I made earlier in the video.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1225057,1227259," Enjoy the final video,"

kMtN9KJHn5Y,1231863,1233298,- Yeah. - Is it rolling?
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1234766,1237836,"Okay, so, hi. So, my name's Marques."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1237936,1238971,My name's Casey.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1240371,1243408,Welcome on our exciting journey
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1243508,1246411,to VHS YouTube success.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1246511,1248580,Yeah. Let's start.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1248680,1252317, ( music playing )
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1258389,1261360,Do! Very important to hold the camera steady.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1261460,1263362,It makes it much easier for the viewer
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1263462,1264696,to see what you are filming.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1266097,1269635,Very important-- don't shake the camera.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1269735,1271370,( laughing ) Cheese balls.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1273504,1275040,"Don't, with editing."
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1275140,1278410,No need for gratuitous transitions.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1278510,1280812,Transitions can be distracting.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1280912,1282981,"Transitions can be very distracting,"
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1283081,1285884,and they don't really help the story along.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1285984,1287953,A big do of editing
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1288053,1290289,"is something called ""continuity,"""
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1290389,1293692,and that means one shot should match the next shot.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1293792,1297462,Be sure to pay close attention to things like clothing.
kMtN9KJHn5Y,1301366,1305070,- Don't... eat... - This is good.
