FqNEx17crMI,560,1687,- [Interviewer] If you had to eat this every day
FqNEx17crMI,1687,5012,what would you think?
FqNEx17crMI,5012,6190,(child retches)
FqNEx17crMI,6190,8020,"- Is this, like, all they eat?"
FqNEx17crMI,8020,10431,Or is there like taco Tuesday?
FqNEx17crMI,10431,13014,(upbeat music)
FqNEx17crMI,19629,20890,- [Interviewer] What do you know about prison?
FqNEx17crMI,20890,25890,"- Prison, you go in there if do something that's not okay."
FqNEx17crMI,25900,27610,- It's a bad place.
FqNEx17crMI,27610,29230,- They have bad food there.
FqNEx17crMI,29230,31080,- I don't think prisoners need to have
FqNEx17crMI,31080,34180,"the best, most fanciest food."
FqNEx17crMI,34180,35360,"- [Interviewer] Well we are going to find out,"
FqNEx17crMI,35360,38713,because you are trying prison food from around the world.
FqNEx17crMI,41770,44603,"All right Nicolas, open your eyes."
FqNEx17crMI,46460,48073,- Eek. - You wanna dig in?
FqNEx17crMI,49120,50520,- Yeah but where's the fork?
FqNEx17crMI,50520,53020,- [Interviewer] In this prison the inmates actually
FqNEx17crMI,53020,55280,eat their food with their hands.
FqNEx17crMI,55280,57773,"- Wait, with my hands?"
FqNEx17crMI,59020,60570,- Then you mix it all together.
FqNEx17crMI,65773,66933,(laughing) - Good?
FqNEx17crMI,67834,70190,- I mean in prison I wouldn't really trust
FqNEx17crMI,70190,72120,where my hands have been.
FqNEx17crMI,72120,74050,I wouldn't wanna use my hands to eat.
FqNEx17crMI,74050,76123,- [Interviewer] Do you ever ear your food with your hands?
FqNEx17crMI,77150,78810,- Never. - In this country
FqNEx17crMI,78810,80840,there's a bunch of stuff that you can get in trouble for
FqNEx17crMI,80840,83119,that we might think is kinda crazy.
FqNEx17crMI,83120,86130,They really don't like kissing in public.
FqNEx17crMI,86130,89159,"- Kissing in public, not a crime."
FqNEx17crMI,89160,90450,- [Interviewer] So you can either go to prison
FqNEx17crMI,90450,93750,or sometimes they'll give you 80 lashes.
FqNEx17crMI,93750,96703,"- Is that, like, with a belt?"
FqNEx17crMI,97690,99520,Oh my gosh.
FqNEx17crMI,99520,101334,- I don't know about that one.
FqNEx17crMI,101334,104470,"That sounds a bit, torturing."
FqNEx17crMI,104470,105570,- [Interviewer] Do you think giving someone
FqNEx17crMI,105570,108380,like unhealthy or gross food is torture in a way?
FqNEx17crMI,108380,111259,- If I ate this every day it'd make me pretty crazy.
FqNEx17crMI,111260,113243,- I can never eat this every day.
FqNEx17crMI,121340,124289,"- Ooh, that smells horrible!"
FqNEx17crMI,124290,125343,- Oh my gosh.
FqNEx17crMI,126310,129293,This does not look fully cooked.
FqNEx17crMI,132680,134370,- Tastes like a sardine.
FqNEx17crMI,134370,136159,- [Interviewer] Where do you think this is from Celine?
FqNEx17crMI,136160,138870,"- Maybe, China?"
FqNEx17crMI,138870,141019,- [Interviewer] This is from Singapore.
FqNEx17crMI,141020,143190,"- What, Singapore?"
FqNEx17crMI,143190,144870,- [Interviewer] Yeah.
FqNEx17crMI,144870,148500,"- Guess what, you can not chew gum or spit in the streets."
FqNEx17crMI,148500,149740,"- [Interviewer] Yes, that is correct."
FqNEx17crMI,149740,150850,So in Singapore they have
FqNEx17crMI,150850,153100,to eat all of their food on the ground.
FqNEx17crMI,153100,155820,"They have to sit in their cell and it's kind of like,"
FqNEx17crMI,155820,158170,slid to them through a hole.
FqNEx17crMI,158170,161380,"- I wish there was like a little teeny, tiny table."
FqNEx17crMI,161380,162721,- Can they eat on their bed?
FqNEx17crMI,162721,163553,- [Interviewer] So they actually don't have a bed.
FqNEx17crMI,165198,167209,- Do you sleep on the ground?
FqNEx17crMI,167210,170220,"- On the floor, there's no like little bed?"
FqNEx17crMI,170220,171980,- [Interviewer] There's just like a straw mat
FqNEx17crMI,171980,174470,"and a blanket, but no pillow."
FqNEx17crMI,174470,178133,"- Oh my gosh, I cannot imagine living without a bed."
FqNEx17crMI,183590,184440,Whoa.
FqNEx17crMI,184440,188070,This looks like what I see in movies.
FqNEx17crMI,188070,189883,- It doesn't look good.
FqNEx17crMI,193714,196330,- Pasta does not taste that great.
FqNEx17crMI,196330,200850,"- This is, not good."
FqNEx17crMI,200850,202380,- No? - No.
FqNEx17crMI,202380,204460,- [Interviewer] What country do you think this is from?
FqNEx17crMI,204460,205680,- Mexico?
FqNEx17crMI,205680,207209,Or maybe Italy?
FqNEx17crMI,207210,208043,- England?
FqNEx17crMI,208980,210930,- [Interviewer] This is from the U.S.A.
FqNEx17crMI,212990,214820,"- Is this, like, all they eat?"
FqNEx17crMI,214820,216920,Or is there like taco Tuesday?
FqNEx17crMI,216920,219170,- [Interviewer] Not usually taco Tuesday no.
FqNEx17crMI,219170,220370,How many people do you think
FqNEx17crMI,220370,223440,in the whole country are in jail?
FqNEx17crMI,223440,225320,"- 5,600."
FqNEx17crMI,225320,227390,- [Interviewer] 2.2 million people.
FqNEx17crMI,227390,229590,- That's a pretty big number.
FqNEx17crMI,229590,231267,- [Interviewer] The U.S. alone spends up to
FqNEx17crMI,231267,235756,$182 billion every year on prison.
FqNEx17crMI,235756,236790,- What?
FqNEx17crMI,236790,239290,"Well I mean, like, they gave us brownies, so like."
FqNEx17crMI,240160,241660,- [Interviewer] So that price makes sense?
FqNEx17crMI,241660,244000,- Yeah. - Where'd all the cake go?
FqNEx17crMI,244000,246253,- [Interviewer] I think you ate all the cake Celine.
FqNEx17crMI,248290,250640,"All right, open your eyes."
FqNEx17crMI,250640,253230,"- What, is that rice?"
FqNEx17crMI,253230,255663,"- Whoa, a real meal."
FqNEx17crMI,257959,260160,That's good. - So this is from
FqNEx17crMI,260160,263670,the Alexander Maconochie Center
FqNEx17crMI,263670,267840,which describes itself as a human rights compliant jail.
FqNEx17crMI,267840,270199,- Sounds like a bit nicer of a jail.
FqNEx17crMI,270200,272280,"In their minds be like, oh these people are human,"
FqNEx17crMI,272280,275120,"they probably have reasons to do this, they have rights too."
FqNEx17crMI,275120,276060,- [Interviewer] Exactly.
FqNEx17crMI,276060,279760,"It's a lot smaller, so there are like 300 prisoners here"
FqNEx17crMI,279760,281820,and it has like a town square
FqNEx17crMI,281820,285350,"so there's like a health building, an education building,"
FqNEx17crMI,285350,287826,"a library, a visiting center."
FqNEx17crMI,287826,289340,- Whoa!
FqNEx17crMI,289340,291030,"- I'd tell them that's pretty good,"
FqNEx17crMI,291030,294310,"'cause, they don't want you to get dumb."
FqNEx17crMI,294310,296430,"- To give them, like, a chance?"
FqNEx17crMI,296430,297500,"- [Interviewer] Yeah that's a good way of putting it,"
FqNEx17crMI,297500,299590,it's kind of just giving somebody a chance.
FqNEx17crMI,299590,300590,- Sounds right.
FqNEx17crMI,300590,302800,"- I mean, I think if you treat a prisoner"
FqNEx17crMI,302800,305330,more like a human than an inmate
FqNEx17crMI,305330,306439,"they'll probably feel like,"
FqNEx17crMI,306440,308080,"oh, I'm being treated as a human"
FqNEx17crMI,308080,310860,I can still live a normal human life.
FqNEx17crMI,310860,314330,"- If I ever went to jail, I'd go here."
FqNEx17crMI,314330,315629,"- [Interviewer] Commit a crime in Australia,"
FqNEx17crMI,315630,318180,if that's really what you've got your heart set on.
FqNEx17crMI,319050,319883,"Actually don't, just don't go to prison,"
FqNEx17crMI,319883,320860,I don't know why I'm advising that.
FqNEx17crMI,320860,322710,- Yeah but I'm just saying
FqNEx17crMI,322710,326979,if I ever went to prison that's where I would go.
FqNEx17crMI,326980,328050,"- [Interviewer] Gotcha, well a lot of times"
FqNEx17crMI,328050,329699,you don't really get that choice.
FqNEx17crMI,330580,332610,- I seriously don't wanna go to jail.
FqNEx17crMI,332610,334300,- [Interviewer] I do not want you to go to jail either.
FqNEx17crMI,334300,335953,Bye! - Bye!
