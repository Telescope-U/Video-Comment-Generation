_J6A7fAwUTk,160,7759,to abortion we can tell you right now  that in a six to three decision written  by justice samuel alito the court has
_J6A7fAwUTk,7759,13280,ruled that states can decide whether  abortion should be legal or illegal
_J6A7fAwUTk,13280,20240,that means according to this um decision  according to justice alito the  constitution does not confer a right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,20240,27359,abortion  roe  versus wade and casey have been  overruled i have the opinion nora
_J6A7fAwUTk,27359,32800,now so we only have the majority it's a  five to four  opinion there is a majority written by
_J6A7fAwUTk,32800,39280,justice alito that says roe versus wade  is history that landmark 1973 ruling
_J6A7fAwUTk,39280,46000,that said a woman had a constitutional  right to abortion now goes back to the  states who can set their own policies on
_J6A7fAwUTk,46000,51199,abortion and decide whether or not they  want to ban it entirely again it's a 5-4
_J6A7fAwUTk,51199,57680,decision there are three fierce descents  by the liberal justices which we are  printing out now and we'll be getting
_J6A7fAwUTk,57680,64960,through all of this  but based on  my quick scan so far  and this is a lengthy opinion it appears
_J6A7fAwUTk,64960,70960,to track somewhat closely there will be  differences to the draft that leaked
_J6A7fAwUTk,70960,77280,almost two months ago now that also  reflected the court was poised to  overturn roe versus wade so we had that
_J6A7fAwUTk,77280,83840,signal then and today we get the final  ruling that 49 year old landmark ruling
_J6A7fAwUTk,83840,90720,that made abortion rights the law of the  land grounded in the constitution  is overturned this is this is huge nora
_J6A7fAwUTk,90720,97280,i mean almost immediately in 23 states  now this means that access to abortion  is severely restricted there's about
_J6A7fAwUTk,97280,103040,nine states that have codified it states  like new jersey states like connecticut  but this will be a patchwork of
_J6A7fAwUTk,103040,109040,differing laws this kicks off an  incredible legal fight jan i know you've  been following us in the states in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,109040,115040,states to test whether those laws on the  books reflect the will of their  constituents or
_J6A7fAwUTk,115040,122000,the political outcome of a very  motivated constituency  on this issue that is so divisive and so
_J6A7fAwUTk,122000,127840,galvany galvanizing on both sides of the  aisle we cannot overestimate the  importance of what is happening today
_J6A7fAwUTk,127840,134720,because for half a century women have  been guaranteed the federal right of  constitutional right to abortion the  supreme court saying today that the
_J6A7fAwUTk,134720,142000,constitution does not confer a right to  abortion it will be left up to the  states and legislatures so therefore the
_J6A7fAwUTk,142000,148959,people that's right  this is how they want abortion policy to  look in their states  what is the legal
_J6A7fAwUTk,148959,154640,um undergirding behind justice alito's  majority opinion well justice alito in
_J6A7fAwUTk,154640,161360,in this majority opinion joined by those  four conservatives essentially says that  roe was wrongly decided from the outset
_J6A7fAwUTk,161360,167680,there is no constitutional provision  that mentions abortion a right to  privacy it is not grounded in the text
_J6A7fAwUTk,167680,174319,of the constitution or in the history of  this country where states even when the  14th amendment which has of course that
_J6A7fAwUTk,174319,181840,very important liberty protection was  ratified shortly after that was ratified  in the late mid to late 1800s
_J6A7fAwUTk,181840,191040,all states made abortion a crime so he  goes back and looks and says roe is just  wrong and yes starry decisis which means
_J6A7fAwUTk,191040,197840,we let the decision stand  that's an important consideration and  that's why the court in 1992 refused to
_J6A7fAwUTk,197840,204080,overturn roe versus wade but today the  court is saying  the court in 92 was wrong
_J6A7fAwUTk,204080,210400,this was wrong when it was decided and  it is our duty to correct it as a matter  of constitutional law because again
_J6A7fAwUTk,210400,216480,constitutional rulings  uh judges generally get to decide those  they're not like if you disagree with
_J6A7fAwUTk,216480,222799,the law that the congress passes and  congress can amend it  it's very difficult to pass a  constitutional amendment
_J6A7fAwUTk,222799,229120,is the fact that roe versus wade the  direct result of the three conservative  justices that president trump put on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,229120,236400,supreme court yes  yes yes because this is why elections  matter no matter what side of this issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,236400,242080,you are on the addition under president  trump of three conservative justices who
_J6A7fAwUTk,242080,248239,oppose abortion rights  the opinion was written by justice  samuel alito he was nominated for
_J6A7fAwUTk,248239,255519,president george w bush it was joined by  justice clarence thomas nominated by  president george h.w bush and the three
_J6A7fAwUTk,255519,260880,other conservatives who joined that  opinion justice neil gorsuch justice  brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett
_J6A7fAwUTk,260880,265919,all three nominated by president trump  you need five votes to have a majority
_J6A7fAwUTk,265919,271759,there's another conservative on that  court chief justice john roberts he did  not join this majority he's written
_J6A7fAwUTk,271759,278639,separately saying that he agrees with  the outcome but that suggests he's not  willing to go as far as this court as he
_J6A7fAwUTk,278639,285280,suggested an oral argument and of course  remember this all started in mississippi  right when mississippi passed a 15-week
_J6A7fAwUTk,285280,291120,ban on abortion i want to dig into the  chief justice roberts thing in just a  moment but first i want to go to our
_J6A7fAwUTk,291120,298160,chief washington correspondent major  garrett because he is there at the  supreme court and of course the crowds
_J6A7fAwUTk,298160,303600,are erupting the supreme court a  fortress tell us what you're seeing
_J6A7fAwUTk,304240,310160,so nora what we need to know is and  observe is this landmark opinion which  many americans millions of them will
_J6A7fAwUTk,310160,316479,view as a retrenchment of an expected  and understood right to access to  abortion has been delivered from within
_J6A7fAwUTk,316479,323120,as you just said a fortress the supreme  court is surrounded on all sides by two  layers of fencing the street you see
_J6A7fAwUTk,323120,330080,behind me is first street in front of  the east capital of the capital united  states there are about 250 protesters
_J6A7fAwUTk,330080,335440,about equally divided on this issue  and immediately after it was clear that
_J6A7fAwUTk,335440,341680,the dobbs decision had been released  there was a roar from those who've all  opposed abortion rights we can see with
_J6A7fAwUTk,341680,347759,our camera embedded into the protesters  that many of those on the  so-called pro-life side are crying
_J6A7fAwUTk,347759,354160,weeping in joy  those who are on the pro-choice  so-called side are angry and anguished
_J6A7fAwUTk,354160,359600,and what is clear from the street  protests again it's not large in number  there have been larger protests in
_J6A7fAwUTk,359600,365759,washington to be sure but they are  passionate they are inflamed and it is  quite clear from within this fortress
_J6A7fAwUTk,365759,371280,this decision will not be the last word  on access to abortion at the state level
_J6A7fAwUTk,371280,377520,or probably in the united states  congress nora  major garrett thank you
_J6A7fAwUTk,377520,385600,i want to explain what this now means  that there is no longer a federal or  constitutional right to an abortion as
_J6A7fAwUTk,385600,391680,roe versus wade has been overturned by  the supreme court also casey overruled
_J6A7fAwUTk,391680,398479,as well i can show you now there are 26  states across america that are certain
_J6A7fAwUTk,398479,404720,or likely to ban at least some access to  abortions here they are 13 of those
_J6A7fAwUTk,404720,412000,states have already passed those  so-called trigger laws that in some  cases ban all abortions no exceptions
_J6A7fAwUTk,412000,417759,for cases of rape incest or to protect  the life of a mother there are 16 states
_J6A7fAwUTk,417759,424319,with democratic-controlled state  legislatures and the district of  columbia that have raced to pass laws
_J6A7fAwUTk,424319,431680,that will protect a woman's right to an  abortion we can show you those states as  well we have a graphic for that but that
_J6A7fAwUTk,431680,436960,what i'm telling trying to tell you with  the red states that essentially that  would immediately ban abortion and these
_J6A7fAwUTk,436960,444000,stand states that have moved to protect  abortion rights we are going to have a  patchwork of america this is a tale of
_J6A7fAwUTk,444000,449360,two americas about where you can get  abortion america and where you cannot
_J6A7fAwUTk,449360,456160,it's just  seismic decision and it's going to be  seismic in the states because now
_J6A7fAwUTk,456160,462160,the state legislatures are going to get  to decide what abortion should look like  what abortion rights should look like in
_J6A7fAwUTk,462160,467280,their states and defining viability  right defining when life begins exactly
_J6A7fAwUTk,467280,472400,and so therefore  people in those states are going to have  to they don't agree with what those 26
_J6A7fAwUTk,472400,478560,states are now about to do are going to  have to mobilize until something may  change at the courts at the federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,478560,485199,level jan crawford is our chief legal  correspondent has covered the supreme  court for three decades this is one of
_J6A7fAwUTk,485199,492000,the most significant reversals of a  constitutional right in our court's  history correct right of course i mean
_J6A7fAwUTk,492000,497919,the court has  many times reverses previous decisions  including uh constitutional decisions
_J6A7fAwUTk,497919,503360,that are wrongly decided i mean if you  think of dred scott and  koromatsu and some of those horrific
_J6A7fAwUTk,503360,510319,decisions  this is been portrayed as the first time  that the court is reversing decision to  take away a right but to those on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,510319,517518,other side and in this majority opinion  that's the wrong analysis this is a  decision that is extending a right as
_J6A7fAwUTk,517518,524320,they would put it to the unborn and that  roe took away so again like with  everything on abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,524320,529839,it depends on how you view the  underlying issue of what and when life
_J6A7fAwUTk,529839,536080,begins and it's so  jan's laying out the legal definitions  here politically this has been so
_J6A7fAwUTk,536080,541279,divisive and so difficult that this has  never been codified at the federal level
_J6A7fAwUTk,541279,547120,into law  even though this is now really seen as a  democrat versus republican issue it
_J6A7fAwUTk,547120,553279,wasn't for decades there were including  the president of the united states  democrats people of faith who felt very
_J6A7fAwUTk,553279,560399,uncomfortable president united states  joe biden in fact um only issued the  word abortion in a speech once since
_J6A7fAwUTk,560399,566240,becoming president of the united states  this gets to so many complicated issues  but at the federal level i ask speaker
_J6A7fAwUTk,566240,571600,pelosi why in all these decades the  united states has not codified this and
_J6A7fAwUTk,571600,576720,even she has recognized the shifting  political balance here that has not made
_J6A7fAwUTk,576720,582800,it possible even when democrats held the  majority to codify this into law so  there's no federal protection there it
_J6A7fAwUTk,582800,590080,becomes the state patchwork that's an  excellent point and i think that's why  it's useful to look back to 1973 when
_J6A7fAwUTk,590080,597680,the court decided roe versus wade  abortion was illegal in this country  until colorado passed a law in 1967.
_J6A7fAwUTk,597680,602800,that was only what i'm not good at math  but six or seven years before roe came  down
_J6A7fAwUTk,602800,608160,13 other states followed and then four  after that so in less than half the  states
_J6A7fAwUTk,608160,614399,when roe came down they'd only just  recently started changing abortion laws  to give more rights to women in those
_J6A7fAwUTk,614399,620880,states roe has remained controversial it  was at the time and even then judge ruth  bader ginsburg said because the court
_J6A7fAwUTk,620880,626800,stepped into this debate too soon and  then set nationwide policy that abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,626800,633680,rights would be protected across the  country the states were moving in that  direction already so they jumped in to
_J6A7fAwUTk,633680,639600,say we're going to just shut off that  debate today and this in this opinion  which i'm still getting through suggests
_J6A7fAwUTk,639600,645440,that debate now will go back to the  states where it should have always  stayed  and then then we will see how it evolves
_J6A7fAwUTk,645440,650640,listening to jan listening i mean i  literally have goose bumps yeah this is  such a huge moment and this will have so
_J6A7fAwUTk,650640,656320,many effects that we can't even fully  appreciate today um you know just  looking at the fights that will be
_J6A7fAwUTk,656320,661360,happening at the state levels and  talking about that defining viability  front page piece in the wall street
_J6A7fAwUTk,661360,667360,journal what does this mean for in vitro  fertilization people who are seeking as  a family to have a child what does this
_J6A7fAwUTk,667360,672480,mean to the embryos that they have  frozen in hope to bring life into the
_J6A7fAwUTk,672480,677920,world what does this mean for employers  what does this mean for insurance  carriers the federal government what do
_J6A7fAwUTk,677920,684079,they do now that they have tried to  guarantee that there will be access to  an abortion pill even in states where
_J6A7fAwUTk,684079,689760,abortion is  made illegal what about women who serve  in the military and get abortion rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,689760,696079,or contraceptive rights through their  government provided  health care what happens there well
_J6A7fAwUTk,696079,701200,right now what the supreme court says is  what happens if you're say a woman in  mississippi
_J6A7fAwUTk,701200,707279,or georgia or any of these states right  now that look poised to say abortion is  illegal is that you're going to have to
_J6A7fAwUTk,707279,714160,go to your state capitol or go to your  ballot box and say wait a minute  of course we should be able to have ivf
_J6A7fAwUTk,714160,721279,you're going to pass these laws that's  your redress now it's not going to be at  this point at the supreme court anymore
_J6A7fAwUTk,721279,728880,there is so much to talk about we are  going to get through not only the legal  impact the political impact the economic
_J6A7fAwUTk,728880,735519,impact let's bring in kelly robinson she  is the executive director of the planned  parenthood action
_J6A7fAwUTk,735519,741839,fund kelly  what does this ruling mean  this is devastating the courts have
_J6A7fAwUTk,741839,747279,failed this country the courts have  failed women and pregnant people all  over this country i have to remind you
_J6A7fAwUTk,747279,754079,there's no state in this country where  banning abortion is popular 80 percent  of people are with us on this issue and
_J6A7fAwUTk,754079,760959,the court this is not the people's court  this is a devastating moment where  people are scared they are afraid and
_J6A7fAwUTk,760959,766240,planned parenthood will be here to  support them in finding care in any way  we possibly can but this moment is dark
_J6A7fAwUTk,766240,772720,and it's devastating  what does it mean in certain states how  will you see the impact for planned
_J6A7fAwUTk,772720,778320,parenthood  the impact is going to be immediate  there are 13 states that will ban
_J6A7fAwUTk,778320,784240,abortion immediately  and you know 26 states over the course  of the next couple of months will ban
_J6A7fAwUTk,784240,791120,access to abortion care that's hundreds  of thousands of people that will be  impacted each year 15 to 20 000 people
_J6A7fAwUTk,791120,797040,per month that we need to make sure are  finding access to care a different way  and the problem is we've already seen
_J6A7fAwUTk,797040,803040,this play out in places like texas and  oklahoma  that have fundamentally banned access in
_J6A7fAwUTk,803040,808959,those states we are seeing people have  to travel across state lines travel  hundreds of miles we're seeing them have
_J6A7fAwUTk,808959,814480,to find uh solutions for their  healthcare needs outside of the  traditional system or at worst be forced
_J6A7fAwUTk,814480,820880,to carry their pregnancies to term this  is not the america we were promised this  is not the interest in the interest of
_J6A7fAwUTk,820880,828079,the people  and we are looking at some of the  polling right now by cbs news kelly
_J6A7fAwUTk,828079,835839,thank you very much for joining us stay  with us if you don't mind as we continue  to pour through these decisions um
_J6A7fAwUTk,835839,840959,in  terms of that polling that we have from  cbs
_J6A7fAwUTk,840959,847040,you feel when the news came out  roe versus wade keep it as it is 64 of
_J6A7fAwUTk,847040,854000,the country say keep it as it is 36  say overturn it the other poll numbers
_J6A7fAwUTk,854000,860160,we have should abortion be generally  available 50 have said yes 33 percent
_J6A7fAwUTk,860160,866000,saying there should be stricter limits  so the numbers here in terms of breaking  down
_J6A7fAwUTk,866000,872079,uh where this country is on this issue  margaret those are national polls but in
_J6A7fAwUTk,872079,878720,the states we're divided and in most of  red america now  abortion is illegal
_J6A7fAwUTk,878720,883920,that's right and defining exactly where  life begins is also of varying places in
_J6A7fAwUTk,883920,889279,certain states  including missouri they're looking at  eight weeks eight weeks after which
_J6A7fAwUTk,889279,894560,abortion would be made illegal and  others they're looking farther out 24  weeks
_J6A7fAwUTk,894560,900639,it's a it's a varying patchwork here and  it will have huge implications  particularly for poor women for women of
_J6A7fAwUTk,900639,908560,color  you know new york and illinois the  highest rates of reported abortion in  2019 but those are reported abortions um
_J6A7fAwUTk,908560,914079,this is something that is you know  across the country across socioeconomic  lines
_J6A7fAwUTk,914079,920320,used here now what does this mean in  terms of the politics it's messy it's  complicated in the state of michigan the
_J6A7fAwUTk,920320,926480,the governor there governor whitmer is  already suing county prosecutors  to try to stop them from enforcing the
_J6A7fAwUTk,926480,934079,original law from 1931  in michigan that made abortion illegal  with no exception for rape with no
_J6A7fAwUTk,934079,939199,exception for incest and so this is  going to get very tangled as people i
_J6A7fAwUTk,939199,946880,think slowly start reading in on exactly  what their local laws are  many people have not necessarily tracked
_J6A7fAwUTk,946880,954160,what those restrictions are because they  knew that the court at the federal level  had secured this and now it's going to
_J6A7fAwUTk,954160,959600,be far more complicated i also looking  at these protesters nora the other thing  i want to highlight the department of
_J6A7fAwUTk,959600,965360,homeland security had already warned  about political violence  in the weeks and months ahead and we
_J6A7fAwUTk,965360,971920,know  that abortion the national abortion  federation found incidents of assault  and battery against providers and
_J6A7fAwUTk,971920,977199,patients was up 128  in 2021 versus 2020. and there's also
_J6A7fAwUTk,977199,983040,been an increase in violence at some of  the pregnancy centers which of course  are there to try to talk women out of
_J6A7fAwUTk,983040,989279,having abortions we've seen that in the  last several weeks planned parenthood  and other groups releasing a statement
_J6A7fAwUTk,989279,994639,this morning saying they were condemning  all types of violence or threats again
_J6A7fAwUTk,994639,999839,anticipating that we may see some of  that in the wake of this decision but  i'm just getting through if i could get
_J6A7fAwUTk,999839,1005600,to some of the um yes and i'll let you  talk let me just do that just to recap  everyone that is just joining us right
_J6A7fAwUTk,1005600,1012160,now the supreme court today has  overruled roe versus wade eliminating
_J6A7fAwUTk,1012160,1018320,the constitutional right to an abortion  after almost 50 years this is a decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,1018320,1024160,that will transform american life it  will reshape our nation's politics and
_J6A7fAwUTk,1024160,1030720,it will lead to almost total bans on  abortions in almost half of the states
_J6A7fAwUTk,1030720,1037038,across america just let that sink in for  a minute about what that means the big
_J6A7fAwUTk,1037038,1042400,question we are asking today what does  it mean  for
_J6A7fAwUTk,1042400,1048799,abortions that are done with pills  because half of abortions are done with  pills what does that mean what does it
_J6A7fAwUTk,1048799,1056080,mean for the future of contraceptive  rights what does it mean for the future  of those who seek fertility treatments
_J6A7fAwUTk,1056080,1061760,and use things like in vitro  fertilization these are all questions  that we are going to try and dive in
_J6A7fAwUTk,1061760,1067520,today what will it mean okay great i  mean what that means is it's going to be  up to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1067520,1073600,the people in the state capitals  so some states are going to try to ban  medical abortions some states are going
_J6A7fAwUTk,1073600,1080000,to try to prevent women from accessing  medical abortions the pills  that might be out of state or out of
_J6A7fAwUTk,1080000,1087039,country  all of those questions now are going to  depend on what the state legislatures  and the governors decide on in those
_J6A7fAwUTk,1087039,1092240,states and that's the bottom line and  it's not  you can no longer go to the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,1092240,1098240,court and say i this law is illegal it's  unconstitutional the court is saying  that there is no constitutional right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1098240,1104880,an abortion go to your state legislator  and tell him take it up with him or her  we're out of it i mean that's basically
_J6A7fAwUTk,1104880,1109919,what the court has said and if we want  to look i'm just going again through  this opinion
_J6A7fAwUTk,1109919,1116080,right at the top and again it appears to  close to track pretty closely to  different language and it's a few pages
_J6A7fAwUTk,1116080,1122000,longer  but on page six of the opinion here's  the here is the essential holding that i
_J6A7fAwUTk,1122000,1128720,mean justice alito and the majority is  saying roe was an abuse of judicial  authority roe was egregiously wrong from
_J6A7fAwUTk,1128720,1133919,the start his reasoning was  exceptionally weak and the decision has  had damaging consequences far from
_J6A7fAwUTk,1133919,1138960,bringing to end a national settlement of  the issue roe and casey the 92 case we
_J6A7fAwUTk,1138960,1144559,talked about have inflamed debate and  deep in division it's time to heed the  constitution and return the issue of
_J6A7fAwUTk,1144559,1150400,abortion to the people's elected  representatives that is the holding in  this case if you've got it if you don't
_J6A7fAwUTk,1150400,1155679,agree with the state if the law if you  don't like it  it's in the state legislatures now the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1155679,1161200,other question people had though as a  result of this ruling  eliminating a constitutional right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1161200,1167919,abortion is what about all these other  areas of the law that are grounded in a  right to privacy under the liberty
_J6A7fAwUTk,1167919,1173840,component of the due process clause of  the 14th amendment there are a lot of  cases right to contraception right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1173840,1179200,same-sex marriage the court has expanded  on that from its original draft that we
_J6A7fAwUTk,1179200,1185360,saw two months ago so this is new so  what is in this  page 71 on page 71
_J6A7fAwUTk,1185360,1190960,the dissenters of course say it calls  into question all of those cases the  liberals are saying this calls into
_J6A7fAwUTk,1190960,1197280,question same-sex marriage this calls  into question a right to contraceptives  because those are grounded again in that
_J6A7fAwUTk,1197280,1205120,same  underpinnings of the constitution that  roe versus wade and subsequently casey  was the court is much stronger today
_J6A7fAwUTk,1205120,1210480,they bolstered that part of their  decision we have stated unequivocally  that nothing in this opinion should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,1210480,1217120,understood to cast out on precedents  that do not concern abortion we have  explained why that is so rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,1217120,1222880,regarding contraception and same-sex  relationships are inherently different  from the right to abortion because the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1222880,1227919,latter as we have stressed as the court  is saying uniquely involves what roe and
_J6A7fAwUTk,1227919,1234080,casey termed potential life it is hard  to see how we could be clearer so the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1234080,1239360,core today is emphasizing this does not  impact those cases because abortion is
_J6A7fAwUTk,1239360,1244720,unique it is unique because of the  prospect of fetal life or as the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1244720,1250559,mississippi law says an  unborn being you're trying to say that  they are making the case that this only
_J6A7fAwUTk,1250559,1258000,deals with abortion don't read more into  it than you should making it it's it's  as justice toledo says it's hard to see
_J6A7fAwUTk,1258000,1263440,how we could be any clearer on this  issue and however justice thomas has
_J6A7fAwUTk,1263440,1269039,issued a concurring opinion but on page  117 he has said that he wants to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1269039,1274960,reconsider griswold lawrence and  oberfeld explain what that means what  justice thomas though wants to do so
_J6A7fAwUTk,1274960,1281200,here's the thomas opinion he's writing  separately he's off on a trip of his own  on this though he's he is writing for
_J6A7fAwUTk,1281200,1288159,himself and remember how many votes you  need five to change the law and not a  single conservative justice is joining
_J6A7fAwUTk,1288159,1293440,him so that means unless they change  their minds and  backtrack on this language that they've
_J6A7fAwUTk,1293440,1299919,written today  there's going to have to be four more  justices who would support that view he
_J6A7fAwUTk,1299919,1306480,is the only one saying that those cases  also are called in the question no one  else joins them the majority says
_J6A7fAwUTk,1306480,1312080,they're not you know jan  we talk about rights being taken away or  lack of access there's also that
_J6A7fAwUTk,1312080,1319039,question of what rights can come out of  this that congress potentially could act  on great point we are putting
_J6A7fAwUTk,1319039,1326559,on women particularly if you look at  just the statistics poor and black women  are the highest recipients of abortions
_J6A7fAwUTk,1326559,1332640,what tools is the federal government  giving them for example to stay employed  and paid while they carry that baby to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1332640,1338799,term and deliver that baby there's no  federal guaranteed  uh you know right to keep getting paid
_J6A7fAwUTk,1338799,1344000,past six weeks  of paid medical leave in this country  there is no consensus on abortion in
_J6A7fAwUTk,1344000,1349360,this country but there is one area of  debate that both sides can come together
_J6A7fAwUTk,1349360,1355120,on and i've been interviewing them for  the last several weeks trying to get  ready for this and that is  mental
_J6A7fAwUTk,1355120,1361280,maternal health  access to child care support for women  in the states and at the federal level
_J6A7fAwUTk,1361280,1367520,has to improve whether you're in a red  state or a blue state a state legislator  or a congress person
_J6A7fAwUTk,1367520,1372960,that is an area of the law that now  especially with this decision has got to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1372960,1379600,more improve  mortality rate of any developed country  in the world century is stunning it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,1379600,1385760,stunning and on that point just to  um clarify 38 of all women who had
_J6A7fAwUTk,1385760,1391679,abortions were non-hispanic black while  33 percent were non-hispanic white 21
_J6A7fAwUTk,1391679,1397039,were hispanic and 7  of  other races 58 of abortions were for
_J6A7fAwUTk,1397039,1404880,women who had never had one before and  this one 9 out of ten abortions in the  u.s in 2019 took place by
_J6A7fAwUTk,1404880,1410080,15 weeks of gestation which was the  original mississippi law
_J6A7fAwUTk,1410080,1416400,dobbs versus jackson health but then  when they argued it they asked for a  total reversal of roe versus 26 states
_J6A7fAwUTk,1416400,1422159,asked the supreme court to overturn roe  versus wade so that gives you some idea  of where those 26 states are going to be
_J6A7fAwUTk,1422159,1428159,and we've already shown a graphic of  that um  but  i'll make one more point and again we'll
_J6A7fAwUTk,1428159,1434240,keep going through this but the role of  the chief justice right i mean until we  had these three recent nominees by
_J6A7fAwUTk,1434240,1441360,president trump uh john roberts could  sometimes move the court he was  considered the swing vote so if roberts
_J6A7fAwUTk,1441360,1446799,didn't want to swing for the fences the  conservatives were restrained because he  could keep them from he was the fifth
_J6A7fAwUTk,1446799,1453279,vote now his vote does not matter there  are five justices who are willing to  swing for the fences and go much further
_J6A7fAwUTk,1453279,1458720,than he did and today he does not join  them on the reasoning and why this court
_J6A7fAwUTk,1458720,1464400,is saying roe and casey should be  overturned he agrees that that state law
_J6A7fAwUTk,1464400,1470480,can be upheld but he doesn't think the  court needs to go as far now  abortion rights supporters say what's
_J6A7fAwUTk,1470480,1476400,the difference if you're going to uphold  a 15-week ban states are just going to  try to uphold a 10-week ban and then a
_J6A7fAwUTk,1476400,1481520,six-week ban so is it a distinction  without a difference perhaps
_J6A7fAwUTk,1481520,1487360,it's an excellent point there had some  been some speculation that chief justice  roberts would achieve some sort of what  people were calling the roberts
_J6A7fAwUTk,1487360,1493679,compromise would he be able to pull one  one i just needed one one and to just  say no let's just keep it at 15 weeks
_J6A7fAwUTk,1493679,1499600,let's old uphold mississippi but let's  not do something as seismic as overturn  roe versus wade do you think he tried to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1499600,1506240,do that absolutely but i think that from  the start that was getting no traction  that's a very difficult it's a 15-week
_J6A7fAwUTk,1506240,1512559,man is completely inconsistent with roe  versus wade which of course prohibits  states from restricting abortion before
_J6A7fAwUTk,1512559,1519120,viability viability is 24 weeks or so  15 weeks is
_J6A7fAwUTk,1519120,1525039,pre-viability it's directly at odds with  roe versus wade so how could you write  that principle decision and the justices
_J6A7fAwUTk,1525039,1531200,the conservative justices signaled in  the oral arguments in early december  that they were not going along with that
_J6A7fAwUTk,1531200,1537200,which is why  i we thought in december that you  predicted that the row was going to be
_J6A7fAwUTk,1537200,1542960,overturned and the only question  was whether it was going to be five to  four  overturning row or whether it would be
_J6A7fAwUTk,1542960,1550240,six to three with roberts finally  agreeing to join the conservatives he  did not  just to recap the supreme court has just
_J6A7fAwUTk,1550240,1557440,ruled in this landmark case it will be  taught in schools  for decades to come it will become just
_J6A7fAwUTk,1557440,1563919,as popular as roe versus wade for people  who can name supreme court decisions  because they have just eliminated the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1563919,1570400,constitutional right for an abortion  after almost 50 years this will lead to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1570400,1576799,all but total bans on the procedure  in about half of the states in america
_J6A7fAwUTk,1576799,1582960,most of them red states in america which  have already passed some of these laws  or have so-called trigger laws and those
_J6A7fAwUTk,1582960,1589200,trigger laws some of those trigger laws  take  abortion is illegal in several states  now right now they take effect
_J6A7fAwUTk,1589200,1594640,immediately others are going to require  signature which we will probably see  this afternoon then those laws will take
_J6A7fAwUTk,1594640,1602080,effect there's a handful that'll take 30  days but right now in  states in america abortion is illegal
_J6A7fAwUTk,1602080,1608960,march for life is an annual rally and  march opposing both the practice and  legality of abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,1608960,1614480,president jeannie mancini is with us and  jeannie your reaction
_J6A7fAwUTk,1614480,1620559,well nora i i can't help but think of  the hundreds of thousands every year the  collective millions of pro-life
_J6A7fAwUTk,1620559,1627039,americans that have marched every single  year since ryobi wade and they've  marched because they believe that the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1627039,1634159,unborn person is the poorest of the poor  the most vulnerable and that abortion is  a human rights abuse and so today all of
_J6A7fAwUTk,1634159,1640960,those who've marched i just want to say  thank you  and we still have our work cut out for  us of course you've mentioned that many
_J6A7fAwUTk,1640960,1646399,states will have life protective laws  and we're very grateful about that and
_J6A7fAwUTk,1646399,1652559,but  there are many threats of violence right  now against the pro-life movement  against americans who just very much
_J6A7fAwUTk,1652559,1658240,have the right to believe in this  and  we need to increase our support to women
_J6A7fAwUTk,1658240,1665200,and men facing unexpected pregnancies  it's already very strong but we  absolutely need to put our money where  our mouth is in that regard
_J6A7fAwUTk,1665200,1670880,how will you do that i mean as you know  more than half of abortions are carried
_J6A7fAwUTk,1670880,1677919,out for women in their 20s in many of  these states i'm thinking about texas in  particular they have rolled back health
_J6A7fAwUTk,1677919,1686159,care coverage  for poor women how will march for life  how will you pivot to help women in need
_J6A7fAwUTk,1686159,1691200,well first the role of the march for  life is to gather pro-life americans in  the public square so that they can
_J6A7fAwUTk,1691200,1697600,testify to the beauty of the unborn  child so that's what we do but many  other organizations will be very
_J6A7fAwUTk,1697600,1704000,involved for example you mentioned texas  and simultaneous to the heartbeat law  being passed there was also a funding
_J6A7fAwUTk,1704000,1712000,stream of 100 million so let me say that  again 100 million that was passed to  provide resources for women in these
_J6A7fAwUTk,1712000,1717279,in these scenarios so  collectively when we consider the  pregnancy resource center movement which
_J6A7fAwUTk,1717279,1722399,i would say is the untold story in the  pro-life movement we know that over 270
_J6A7fAwUTk,1722399,1729200,million dollars of free resources are  made available to men and women facing  unexpected pregnancies every single year
_J6A7fAwUTk,1729200,1734640,now we need to increase that i know for  example of a beautiful church in  gaithersburg maryland you can check it
_J6A7fAwUTk,1734640,1739679,out yourself it's called saint john  newman and they have vowed to making  sure that every single woman in
_J6A7fAwUTk,1739679,1745520,gaithersburg maryland will have  everything that she needs so that she  won't ever feel backed into a corner to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1745520,1751600,make the choice of abortion you know  we've gone from this idea of abortion  being safe legal and rare to abortion on
_J6A7fAwUTk,1751600,1757360,demand  until birth paid for by your tax dollars  and today's decision takes that away
_J6A7fAwUTk,1757360,1763039,essentially it allows the united states  to stop being one of only seven  countries around the entire world that
_J6A7fAwUTk,1763039,1769120,allows late term abortion it allows  states to be able to limit abortion at  15 weeks and earlier if they so choose
_J6A7fAwUTk,1769120,1775760,so it really returns it to the people  and i'm grateful  jeannie mancini the president of march
_J6A7fAwUTk,1775760,1781279,for life thank you want to bring back in  our jan crawford our chief legal  correspondent i know you're still
_J6A7fAwUTk,1781279,1787679,pouring through this decision  um i just i want to get to some of the  dissents um obviously
_J6A7fAwUTk,1787679,1795039,um  the the and keep in mind kind of where  we are the landscape here five justices
_J6A7fAwUTk,1795039,1801600,takes five justices to form a majority  on the court that's what we have today  the fifth vote was our newest justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,1801600,1807360,amy coney barrett who replaced of course  the late justice ruth bader ginsburg  that is
_J6A7fAwUTk,1807360,1813360,decisive right  fierce defender of women's rights and  women's abortion rights and if she were
_J6A7fAwUTk,1813360,1820880,still on the court or someone who had  replaced her who had a liberal  perspective the court would not have  overturned roe or casey
_J6A7fAwUTk,1820880,1826399,um but we have some powerful dissents  from the three remaining liberals  all joined
_J6A7fAwUTk,1826399,1833760,justice breyer sotomayor and kagan and  there is a joint descent not written by
_J6A7fAwUTk,1833760,1840320,one with others joining it's a joint  descent meaning they all agree with this  and they emphasize throughout the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1840320,1846240,dissent  really what they see the court is doing  here and if i could just read from page
_J6A7fAwUTk,1846240,1851679,two uh right at the top um  it's it
_J6A7fAwUTk,1851679,1858000,the court's ruling the liberals say says  that from the very moment of  fertilization a woman has no rights to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1858000,1864399,speak of a state can force her to bring  a pregnancy to term even at the steepest  personal and familial cost an abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,1864399,1871120,restriction is permissible  and  it then goes on to predict  states will feel free to enact all
_J6A7fAwUTk,1871120,1876559,manner of restrictions saying that we've  already seen it  going on to predict that there will be
_J6A7fAwUTk,1876559,1882960,many more to come and then on page four  the dissent the joint descent says  whatever the exact scope of the coming
_J6A7fAwUTk,1882960,1890559,laws one result of today's decision is  certain the curtailment of women's  rights and of their status as free and
_J6A7fAwUTk,1890559,1896399,equal citizens yesterday the  constitution guaranteed a woman  confronted with an unplanned pregnancy
_J6A7fAwUTk,1896399,1901760,could make her own decision but today  that is no longer
_J6A7fAwUTk,1901760,1907519,and that is why i think it was such an  important question you asked during that  march for life interview of what tools
_J6A7fAwUTk,1907519,1914159,are being provided to women to go  through the very dangerous process of  actually delivering a child
_J6A7fAwUTk,1914159,1920480,that's what the maternal mortality  numbers mean that means it is a risk to  your life to carry a child to term more
_J6A7fAwUTk,1920480,1927200,so in this country than other developed  countries in the world what becomes the  policy response of the state and the  federal level to that what becomes the
_J6A7fAwUTk,1927200,1932960,policy response to the children who are  born into poverty in these states for  two women who would have otherwise
_J6A7fAwUTk,1932960,1940159,aborted because it puts even more of a  burden back on those governments and on  those taxpayers to provide potentially
_J6A7fAwUTk,1940159,1946320,what is our policy response there i mean  that's kind of where i see another part  of this argument going that impacts not
_J6A7fAwUTk,1946320,1952480,just women but families across the board  in this country you raised an appointed  report when earlier when you said what
_J6A7fAwUTk,1952480,1958399,could the federal government do  suggesting that perhaps  they can pass legislation uh to give
_J6A7fAwUTk,1958399,1964159,more support for child care  more time off  enhanced maternal
_J6A7fAwUTk,1964159,1969760,health programs there's also going to be  a lot of questions about what president  biden can do
_J6A7fAwUTk,1969760,1974960,for example can he do anything through  executive order  to
_J6A7fAwUTk,1974960,1981200,make medical abortion  more available through the mail and have  the fda do something like that let's
_J6A7fAwUTk,1981200,1986880,bring in our chief white house  correspondent nancy cordes because she  is with us and can dig in on just that
_J6A7fAwUTk,1986880,1993120,very point president biden has talked  about these so-called executive orders  or actions but would it really do
_J6A7fAwUTk,1993120,2000000,anything nancy  well nora it certainly wouldn't  make up for abortion being banned in
_J6A7fAwUTk,2000000,2005440,multiple states but  the president is being urged by abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,2005440,2010720,rights activists to take a series of  actions that would make it easier for
_J6A7fAwUTk,2010720,2016559,women who live in states where abortion  is banned to go ahead and get an  abortion so for example just today a
_J6A7fAwUTk,2016559,2023600,group of african-american female  lawmakers urged him to declare a public  health emergency if this ruling were to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2023600,2029919,come down the way that it now has there  are others as jan mentioned who are  urging him to drop the last fda
_J6A7fAwUTk,2029919,2036960,restrictions on the sale of abortion  pills currently pharmacies need a  special license in order to depend
_J6A7fAwUTk,2036960,2043279,dispense those pills  there are many democrats who want him to  push the fda to do away with that
_J6A7fAwUTk,2043279,2049280,provide travel vouchers possibly for  women who need to cross state lines to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2049280,2055679,to get an abortion  they want him to look into whether  abortions can be provided on federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,2055679,2062560,lands in states that ban abortion so  there's sort of a whole menu there for  the president to choose from the white
_J6A7fAwUTk,2062560,2069919,house has been very quiet about what  exactly he will do that we do expect to  hear from him sometime today
_J6A7fAwUTk,2069919,2075599,nancy cordes at the white house also  want to bring in our chief election and  campaign correspondent robert costa he
_J6A7fAwUTk,2075599,2081040,is on capitol hill this morning and  robert this is one of the chief legacies
_J6A7fAwUTk,2081040,2086800,for former president trump  um he was successful along with senate
_J6A7fAwUTk,2086800,2092800,then senate majority leader mitch  mcconnell of appointing a number of  judges to the federal benches and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2092800,2100720,including three to the supreme court  what do you think happens now with the  midterms just less than six months away
_J6A7fAwUTk,2100720,2108560,that's exactly right nora this moment is  the culmination of a conservative  project inside the republican party to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2108560,2115280,upend the federal judiciary overhaul it  by nominating conservatives across the  board including to the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,2115280,2122000,former president trump nominated justice  gorsuch got him confirmed then justice  kavanaugh then finally justice coney
_J6A7fAwUTk,2122000,2128079,barrett this decision today landed like  a thunderclap on capitol hill and on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2128079,2135359,american political scene it changes the  dynamics potentially for the midterm  elections bringing this issue social
_J6A7fAwUTk,2135359,2142240,issues abortion rights to the floor of a  midterm campaign and discussion that had  been primarily focused so far on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2142240,2148400,economy and on inflation  and we're showing now the states with  trigger laws that would restrict
_J6A7fAwUTk,2148400,2154640,abortions now that roe versus wade is  overturned  most of these
_J6A7fAwUTk,2154640,2161680,traditionally red states as we call them  or conservative states um if you will  jan you were talking about and in many
_J6A7fAwUTk,2161680,2166800,of these states it will be illegal today  or in order it's already illegal  immediate that's the way the laws were
_J6A7fAwUTk,2166800,2173440,written some states uh requires a  signature again i'm sure we'll see that  in some state capitals this afternoon
_J6A7fAwUTk,2173440,2178560,where there will be fanfare signing it  then it will take effect later this  afternoon right and that's why when we
_J6A7fAwUTk,2178560,2184960,talked about michigan for example where  it's already illegal under this 1931 law  you have the governor a democratic
_J6A7fAwUTk,2184960,2191040,governor with the republican legislature  turning to the courts to have a fight  about this so yesterday you had vice
_J6A7fAwUTk,2191040,2197119,president harris meeting with about  seven state attorneys general to talk  about finding creative solutions here
_J6A7fAwUTk,2197119,2204640,they want to look like they're doing  something though as jan just laid out  there's very little  that can be done to actually change this
_J6A7fAwUTk,2204640,2210640,but at the state level  the bind administration wants to look  like they are encouraging something and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2210640,2217200,some of these creative lawsuits  we are  just wrapping up our coverage of
_J6A7fAwUTk,2217200,2222400,this historic day here in washington and  so jan i want to ask you what does this
_J6A7fAwUTk,2222400,2228000,ruling mean for women in america for the  future of politics in america i mean roe
_J6A7fAwUTk,2228000,2234320,versus wade was the few decisions  americans can say by name that decision  is history and this
_J6A7fAwUTk,2234320,2239760,issue of abortion and abortion rights  what it means is the supreme court will  not have any say anymore it's going to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2239760,2246160,be up to your elected representatives in  the state where you live and that's  where the fight is going to be and the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2246160,2253760,supreme court and its majority is saying  that's where it always should have been  roe was wrongly decided from the start  do you expect margaret
_J6A7fAwUTk,2253760,2259359,marches across america that this becomes  the top issue in campaigns absolutely in
_J6A7fAwUTk,2259359,2265040,fact i was personally surprised in some  ways that this was happening on a friday  going into a weekend where there are
_J6A7fAwUTk,2265040,2272320,warnings of political violence and  marches and not held for monday for  example when people are at work this is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2272320,2279920,something that we will be tracking very  closely thank you very much and  this is a historic day because after
_J6A7fAwUTk,2279920,2285680,nearly 50 years the supreme court has  overturned roe versus wade taking away
_J6A7fAwUTk,2285680,2291040,the constitutional right to an abortion  and with that decision roe versus wade
_J6A7fAwUTk,2291040,2297200,is no longer the law of the land  i'm nora o'donnell in washington we'll
_J6A7fAwUTk,2297200,2302440,have more tonight on the cbs evening  news
_J6A7fAwUTk,2307470,2313839,[Music]  we've just been watching a cbs news a
_J6A7fAwUTk,2313839,2321760,special report talking about the supreme  court's monumental decision that  overturns roe v wade the case is dobbs
_J6A7fAwUTk,2321760,2327839,versus jackson women's health  organization it is focused on a  mississippi law but the end result is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2327839,2333200,that 50 years of precedent has now been  overturned that's right the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,2333200,2338880,court ruling that the constitution does  not confer a right to abortion that
_J6A7fAwUTk,2338880,2345599,simple phrase changing the legal  landscape all over the united states of  america already divided over this issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,2345599,2352160,it kicks down to state some states ready  to bring in their own  laws outlawing abortion and before we
_J6A7fAwUTk,2352160,2358640,get into our discussion on this let's  listen to house speaker nancy pelosi  mitch mcconnell
_J6A7fAwUTk,2358640,2365040,and the republican party their super  majority in the supreme court  american women today have less freedom
_J6A7fAwUTk,2365040,2370880,than their mothers  with roe  and their attempt to destroy it radical
_J6A7fAwUTk,2370880,2377760,republicans are charging ahead with  their crusade  to criminalize  health freedom
_J6A7fAwUTk,2377760,2383200,in the congress  be aware of this the republicans
_J6A7fAwUTk,2383200,2388640,are plotting a nationwide abortion ban  they cannot be allowed to have a
_J6A7fAwUTk,2388640,2394000,majority in the congress  to do that  but that's their goal
_J6A7fAwUTk,2394000,2399760,and if you read and again we're all  studying all this but it be read what is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2399760,2406960,in the  very clear  one of the justices had his own
_J6A7fAwUTk,2406960,2412000,statement  it's about contraception in vitro
_J6A7fAwUTk,2412000,2418079,fertilization  family planning
_J6A7fAwUTk,2418079,2425720,that is all what will spring  from their decision that they made today
_J6A7fAwUTk,2425920,2431280,such a contradiction  yesterday to say the states
_J6A7fAwUTk,2431280,2436800,cannot make laws governing  the constitutional right to bear arms
_J6A7fAwUTk,2436800,2442720,and today  they're saying the exact reverse  that the states
_J6A7fAwUTk,2442720,2449520,can overturn  a constitutional right for 50 years a  constitutional right
_J6A7fAwUTk,2449520,2455520,for women having the right to choose  the hypocrisy is raging
_J6A7fAwUTk,2455520,2460240,but the harm  is endless
_J6A7fAwUTk,2463520,2469280,what this means to women is such an  insult  it's a slap in the face to women about
_J6A7fAwUTk,2469280,2475119,using their own judgment  to make their own decisions
_J6A7fAwUTk,2475119,2480319,about their reproductive freedom  and again it goes well i always have
_J6A7fAwUTk,2480319,2487760,said the termination of a pregnancy is  just their opening act it's just their  front game but because but beyond
_J6A7fAwUTk,2487760,2492960,behind it and for years i have seen in  this congress opposition to any family
_J6A7fAwUTk,2492960,2498800,planning domestic  or global  when we have had those discussions and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2498800,2506319,those debates and those votes on the  floor of the house  this is deadly serious
_J6A7fAwUTk,2506319,2513599,but we are not going to let this pass  a woman's right to choose
_J6A7fAwUTk,2513599,2520960,reproductive freedom  is on the ballot in november  we cannot allow them
_J6A7fAwUTk,2520960,2526160,to take charge so that they can  institute their goal
_J6A7fAwUTk,2526160,2532079,which is to criminalize  reproductive freedom
_J6A7fAwUTk,2532079,2539760,to criminalize it  right now they're saying in states that  they can arrest doctors and all the rest
_J6A7fAwUTk,2539760,2545119,what is happening here  what is happening here a woman's  fundamental health decisions are her own
_J6A7fAwUTk,2545119,2550480,to make in consultation with her doctor  her faith her family
_J6A7fAwUTk,2550480,2556319,not some right-wing politicians  that donald trump and mitch mcconnell
_J6A7fAwUTk,2556319,2562560,pack the court with  while republicans seek to punish and  control women democrats will keep
_J6A7fAwUTk,2562560,2567680,fighting ferociously  to enshrine roe v wade
_J6A7fAwUTk,2567680,2573760,into the law of the land  this cruel ruling is outrageous and  heart-wrenching
_J6A7fAwUTk,2573760,2578760,but make no mistake  again
_J6A7fAwUTk,2579280,2585920,it's all on the ballot in november  the supreme court has ended a  constitutional right this is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2585920,2592640,50 years  proclaimed a constitutional right  what happened today was historic in many
_J6A7fAwUTk,2592640,2598880,respects  historic in that  it had  not granted
_J6A7fAwUTk,2598880,2605440,recognized a constitutional right and  then reversed it  this is a first
_J6A7fAwUTk,2605440,2612480,and again  just before it imposed a constitutional  right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2612480,2618240,allow for concealed weapons  how about those justices coming before
_J6A7fAwUTk,2618240,2625040,the senators and saying that they  they respected  sarah decision the president of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2625040,2632319,court  that they respected the right of privacy  in the constitution of the united states
_J6A7fAwUTk,2632960,2639760,did you hear that  were they not telling the truth then
_J6A7fAwUTk,2641359,2647760,again  just getting to the gun issue because
_J6A7fAwUTk,2647760,2653359,really  in preparation for this morning i was  really an exalted state about what
_J6A7fAwUTk,2653359,2659680,happened in the united states  senate yesterday  counterpoint
_J6A7fAwUTk,2659680,2665520,to the dangerous decision of this  trumpian supreme court that they made
_J6A7fAwUTk,2665520,2672640,yesterday  but a way to take us to as the bill is  called community safety
_J6A7fAwUTk,2672880,2678000,the bipartisan safer communities act  right now and i'm going to have to leave
_J6A7fAwUTk,2678000,2684319,momentarily because we just finished  voting on the rule  we will be debating the bill  on the floor
_J6A7fAwUTk,2684319,2690480,and we expect a good bipartisan vote on  it in the house we congratulate the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2690480,2696480,senate on the work that they have done  and the timeliness of it to be passed in
_J6A7fAwUTk,2696480,2703200,the senate in a strong bipartisan way on  a day  when the court  made such a dangerous
_J6A7fAwUTk,2703200,2709920,dangerous decision  we will  many of our house democrats proposals
_J6A7fAwUTk,2709920,2717200,that are included in this package  are that keep deadly weapons out of  dangerous hands by encouraging states to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2717200,2723760,establish extreme risk protection order  laws  erpo otherwise known as red flag laws
_J6A7fAwUTk,2723760,2729920,help put into straw purchases close the  boyfriend loophole
_J6A7fAwUTk,2731599,2737599,so many good things are in there and  it's not everything that we wanted we  must keep moving toward background
_J6A7fAwUTk,2737599,2743680,checks but  universal background checks which will  save the most lots but this will save
_J6A7fAwUTk,2743680,2749280,lives  and to listen to lucy mcgrath and other  family members of those who have lost
_J6A7fAwUTk,2749280,2754319,their loved ones  this is a giant step forward
_J6A7fAwUTk,2754319,2761520,maybe not so much a giant but a strong  step  forward and if it's good enough for them
_J6A7fAwUTk,2761520,2766720,then we rejoice in passing it  as i say to members all the time with
_J6A7fAwUTk,2766720,2773680,legislation  do not judge it for what isn't in it  but respect it for what is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2773680,2778560,and there's much to be respected in this  legislation
_J6A7fAwUTk,2779040,2785680,on a happier note yesterday we  celebrated 50 years of title ix  which has transformed equality and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2785680,2791839,opportunity in our country are you  familiar with the words of title ix  yesterday we had billie jean king here
_J6A7fAwUTk,2791839,2797440,once again celebrating title nine  unveiling a portrait of of
_J6A7fAwUTk,2797440,2803200,patsy mink who is the author in the  house working with birch bai  in the senate
_J6A7fAwUTk,2803200,2809520,to make this the law of the land and  this is what it says  no person in the united states shall on
_J6A7fAwUTk,2809520,2815839,the basis of sex be excluded from  participation in being denied the  benefits of or be subjected to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2815839,2821280,discrimination under any education  program or activity receiving federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,2821280,2827760,financial assistance  again in honor of this anniversary we  unveiled a portrait which will hang in
_J6A7fAwUTk,2827760,2832960,the halls it's about our first the first  she's actually the first woman of color
_J6A7fAwUTk,2832960,2839920,to serve in the congress  so she's honored for her first but also  for what she accomplished we already
_J6A7fAwUTk,2839920,2845520,have a painting of all right so we're  going to pull away from the speaker of  the house for now when she starts to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2845520,2851680,take questions we may dip back in she's  speaking about title ix but we want to  speak about um this sort of monumental
_J6A7fAwUTk,2851680,2857680,decision made by the supreme court a  decision that that overturns roe v wade  and  you know you read out sort of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2857680,2863040,signature quote i think from the  majority decision which is there is  nothing in the constitution about
_J6A7fAwUTk,2863040,2870640,abortion and the constitution does not  implicitly protect the right and so the  next component of that is it is time to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2870640,2876640,heed the constitution and return the  issue of abortion to the people's  elected representatives meaning that
_J6A7fAwUTk,2876640,2882319,this decision means that there's no  federal protection when it comes to  abortion and the decision goes back to
_J6A7fAwUTk,2882319,2888079,the states  tens of millions of women in the united  states of america no longer have a
_J6A7fAwUTk,2888079,2894800,federal protection to an abortion  impacting their lives in ways that we  cannot fully grasp or understand right
_J6A7fAwUTk,2894800,2901760,now we have uh the best legal minds with  a cbs news legal contributor rebecca  royfi is here with us and we also have
_J6A7fAwUTk,2901760,2909119,leah littmann a michigan law michigan  law professor to help us digest all of  this as a man let me just step back and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2909119,2916640,first get reaction from you both  um just as people and as american women  on what we have just witnessed
_J6A7fAwUTk,2916640,2922000,i mean it's a radical moment and as  everybody has been saying this is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2922000,2927440,monumental it is you know my mother's  generation fought extremely hard for
_J6A7fAwUTk,2927440,2933280,this right and now it is gone so we are  back where we were from a generation of
_J6A7fAwUTk,2933280,2940480,women's perspectives we were back where  we were in  the 1960s before this right existed and
_J6A7fAwUTk,2940480,2947520,you know back back to that fight so it's  so it you know it it's hard to measure  really um the impact of this on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,2947520,2954160,country leah  i think the joint descent by justices  kagan breyer and sotomayor was
_J6A7fAwUTk,2954160,2960559,completely right when they said one  certain result of today's decision is  the curtailment of women's rights and of
_J6A7fAwUTk,2960559,2965680,their status as  free and equal citizens
_J6A7fAwUTk,2965680,2970720,so let us get into the arguments on both  sides let's talk about the majority  opinion we know that the argument is
_J6A7fAwUTk,2970720,2977839,essentially uh the constitution does not  uh protect abortion  there was an understanding that that
_J6A7fAwUTk,2977839,2985280,abortion came under the umbrella of a  right to privacy which is also not in  the constitution but the feeling was
_J6A7fAwUTk,2985280,2990960,that the decision was that there was a  suggestion of the right to privacy based  on other amendments
_J6A7fAwUTk,2990960,2996480,right so the first eight amendments list  certain rights and they explicitly
_J6A7fAwUTk,2996480,3003920,mention rights we've been talking about  gun rights that's in the second  amendment first amendment rights freedom  religion speech the ninth amendment says
_J6A7fAwUTk,3003920,3009920,none of this should be taken to mean  that there aren't other rights that are  reserved to the people and so these have
_J6A7fAwUTk,3009920,3016559,been over time referred to as the  unenumerated rights their rights that  aren't specifically and explicitly
_J6A7fAwUTk,3016559,3024559,listed so those exist the constitution  does acknowledge that some rights that  aren't explicitly listed exist but the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3024559,3030240,question is how do we identify those  rights and how do we
_J6A7fAwUTk,3030240,3036640,then protect those rights and  traditionally what the court does is  develop over time a precedent that
_J6A7fAwUTk,3036640,3041839,establishes what those rights are and  the right to abortion grew out of as you
_J6A7fAwUTk,3041839,3047280,say this notion that there is a kind of  general not unlimited but certain right  to privacy which is essentially about
_J6A7fAwUTk,3047280,3054000,the right to define our own lives to  have control over our own lives and  those include the right to contraception
_J6A7fAwUTk,3054000,3061359,and other rights like that so this was  seen along in those in that that line of  unenumerated rights but the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,3061359,3066559,court said but this was not unlike some  of those other rights deeply rooted in
_J6A7fAwUTk,3066559,3073359,history and therefore  it was wrongly decided and that's you  know that again it's like after this and
_J6A7fAwUTk,3073359,3078800,the gun case the name of the game is may  the best historian win right what we
_J6A7fAwUTk,3078800,3085839,care about is much more what the world  looked like in 1787 1868 than what it
_J6A7fAwUTk,3085839,3092160,looks like now and and and you know that  that is a very clear message coming out  of both of these cases rebecca royfi is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3092160,3099359,our legal contributor we also have leah  lipman a michigan law professor with us  plus uh cbs news legal contributor
_J6A7fAwUTk,3099359,3104720,jessica levinson all a part of this  conversation is our viewers which is  seeing some live images outside the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3104720,3110480,supreme court you know moments after it  struck down the constitutional right to  an abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,3110480,3118240,um jessica what what is your reaction to  what we've witnessed one one detail  emerging out of this is that the opinion
_J6A7fAwUTk,3118240,3124400,is virtually identical to that leaked  draft we saw earlier how
_J6A7fAwUTk,3124400,3131680,what does that tell us about despite the  fact that cbs polling shows what 65  percent of americans support keeping the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3131680,3138720,constitutional right to abortion this  supreme court disagreeing with that  what's your reaction
_J6A7fAwUTk,3138720,3145440,it shows us that supreme court justices  do not make decisions based on what is  popular and what polling says and
_J6A7fAwUTk,3145440,3151839,sometimes that is very good we can think  back to really deep moments and dark  moments in our nation's history where we
_J6A7fAwUTk,3151839,3158880,don't want the supreme court to be in  step with the popular will or political  branches we can think back to a number
_J6A7fAwUTk,3158880,3165599,of decisions where the court actually  protected individual rights i think  against what really was popular at the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3165599,3172079,time this is the opposite of that in my  view this is the court taking away  rights and yes rights that have become
_J6A7fAwUTk,3172079,3178720,popular that i think a lot of people are  waking up this morning despite that  leaked opinion and they are truly
_J6A7fAwUTk,3178720,3185359,shocked i will say i am surprised that  the language didn't soften from the  leaked opinion given the fact that
_J6A7fAwUTk,3185359,3191040,abortion is so comparatively  settled and that the majority of people
_J6A7fAwUTk,3191040,3196160,in this country do support abortion  rights i thought the language would  soften not the outcome
_J6A7fAwUTk,3196160,3201680,i was wrong this is by justice alito i  think he's been waiting decades to write  this opinion and i think his
_J6A7fAwUTk,3201680,3207440,conservative colleagues have been  waiting decades to join this opinion and  they really did not bow to political
_J6A7fAwUTk,3207440,3213040,pressure and you know you talk about you  thought the language would soften what  we didn't get with the leaked document
_J6A7fAwUTk,3213040,3218160,is the chief justice's opinion and  he he's often a swing vote right he's
_J6A7fAwUTk,3218160,3224559,considered conservative but he could go  anyway and in in this case he went with  the majority
_J6A7fAwUTk,3224559,3229920,but for different reasons um so leah  i'll sort of bounce this at you what did
_J6A7fAwUTk,3229920,3236880,you make of um justice uh  the chief justice uh  zis decision and what he wrote about
_J6A7fAwUTk,3236880,3243040,this case  the chief justice's separate writing  reflects his tendency to want to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3243040,3248400,undermine and limit precedence before  outright overruling them and in this
_J6A7fAwUTk,3248400,3253839,particular case he would have preferred  to undermine the protections of roe and
_J6A7fAwUTk,3253839,3260000,casey by allowing states to prohibit  before viability abortions but without
_J6A7fAwUTk,3260000,3265280,deciding whether they can enact complete  and total bans on abortion and leaving
_J6A7fAwUTk,3265280,3272079,that issue for another day but the  reality is once president trump got his  third appointment to the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,3272079,3279599,the chief justice's influence and role  on the court was substantially minimized  because his vote is no longer necessary
_J6A7fAwUTk,3279599,3286000,for the other five conservatives to do  what they want and so it both reflects  his institutional tendency to want to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3286000,3293040,limit decisions before overruling them  but also underscores his now quite  limited role on the court and professor
_J6A7fAwUTk,3293040,3298480,lipman we're watching images from  outside the supreme  court and we know that there will be
_J6A7fAwUTk,3298480,3303680,demonstrations and protests in our  special report earlier there was an  allusion to potential violence across
_J6A7fAwUTk,3303680,3309200,the country we know that abortion  clinics have already experienced that in  many places across the country
_J6A7fAwUTk,3309200,3316400,despite the public outcry what are the  legal paths if any now for those who
_J6A7fAwUTk,3316400,3323200,still believe there should be federal  protections for those who want to seek  abortions
_J6A7fAwUTk,3323200,3328880,the legal paths for abortion protection  now will lie primarily in the states in
_J6A7fAwUTk,3328880,3334079,addition to attempting to secure state  legislation that safeguards access to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3334079,3339160,abortion litigants might look to state  courts and the protections in state
_J6A7fAwUTk,3339160,3345040,constitutions in order to try to secure  access to abortion now there are some
_J6A7fAwUTk,3345040,3350880,limited avenues for action at the  federal level but the reality is that  the most
_J6A7fAwUTk,3350880,3356000,important and meaningful protections  would be federal legislation and it just
_J6A7fAwUTk,3356000,3363119,doesn't seem that likely that either the  senate is willing to break the  filibuster in order to protect abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,3363119,3369920,rights or that there are 60  votes in the senate to secure abortion  rights and so in the absence of
_J6A7fAwUTk,3369920,3376559,legislation there are some things the  biden administration could do like  attempt to safeguard access to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3376559,3383040,medication abortion but there aren't  one-off magical solutions that the biden
_J6A7fAwUTk,3383040,3389440,administration can just do to snap its  fingers and ensure meaningful access to  abortion throughout the country i'm sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,3389440,3395680,of torn as to which way to go with this  conversation because i think you know  i'm really interested in the trigger
_J6A7fAwUTk,3395680,3401599,laws and the impact that's going to  happen but also the concern about the  spillover effect right if if there is no
_J6A7fAwUTk,3401599,3407920,real sort of right to privacy then what  about these other things right what  about same-sex marriage what about um in
_J6A7fAwUTk,3407920,3412960,vitro fertilization now the majority in  the majority decision alito says that's
_J6A7fAwUTk,3412960,3419440,different that's different because we're  not talking about life here but why is  it different jessica so
_J6A7fAwUTk,3419440,3424480,rebecca i'm sorry rebecca jessica's over  there  so
_J6A7fAwUTk,3424480,3430720,well first of all there was an opinion  by justice thomas particularly saying he  thinks but no other conservative justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,3430720,3436480,signed on to that opinion saying that he  thinks that those rights should go as  well  those aren't supported in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3436480,3442640,constitution they aren't deeply rooted  in history they should go  but i think you know he's standing alone
_J6A7fAwUTk,3442640,3448640,he couldn't  obtain any other conservative justice to  sign on to that opinion so i still
_J6A7fAwUTk,3448640,3455119,think that those rights will remain  protected but you know it is certainly
_J6A7fAwUTk,3455119,3461359,um troubling  because the la there's much there's a  lot of language in the opinion that
_J6A7fAwUTk,3461359,3466799,leaves them at least somewhat vulnerable  which is what we heard house speaker  nancy pelosi allude to as she was
_J6A7fAwUTk,3466799,3472319,speaking live moments ago her quote was  um hypocrisy is raging but the harm is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3472319,3477359,endless her point being that yesterday's  supreme court decision seemed to take
_J6A7fAwUTk,3477359,3484160,away rights from states when it came to  regulating how guns are purchased  today's ruling seems to give more rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,3484160,3491119,to the states and taking away  from the federal government we've got uh  rebecca roy here our legal contributor
_J6A7fAwUTk,3491119,3497280,we've got leah littman a michigan law  professor with us as well and jessica  levinson um ladies please feel free to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3497280,3502480,speak amongst yourselves and jump in as  we continue this kind of open-ended  conversation
_J6A7fAwUTk,3502480,3507599,if the control room can show the  graphics from our recent cbs news  polling we can show you more in depth
_J6A7fAwUTk,3507599,3513839,from what our analysis and our  surveys around the country have shown  about the mood toward abortion we
_J6A7fAwUTk,3513839,3520160,mentioned already 65 of those polled  already said they want to keep roe  versus wade as it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3520160,3526000,35 percent um uh wanted to over turn it  you see this poll showing
_J6A7fAwUTk,3526000,3532799,50 of americans say abortion should be  generally available this poll now the  one i just mentioned to you and then in
_J6A7fAwUTk,3532799,3538640,the next graph we may be able to see if  is this as is the case now row versus  weighted overturned
_J6A7fAwUTk,3538640,3544160,abortion in your state should be  i think that may be the next poll
_J6A7fAwUTk,3544160,3553040,mostly legal 65 of americans two-thirds  illegal by a third so that's the  national um divide but there is no um
_J6A7fAwUTk,3553040,3558319,consensus among the states it's a real  patchwork now  right exactly and you know that's why as
_J6A7fAwUTk,3558319,3565359,you said before you know it's  interesting the way that these two  decisions have transformed what it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3565359,3572559,that we are willing to allow state  legislatures to decide  20 years ago it would have been the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3572559,3577839,polar opposite where states are allowed  to decide what sorts of gun laws to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3577839,3585440,enact what sorts how to balance public  safety with the right to  possess a gun and now
_J6A7fAwUTk,3585440,3591839,states are severely restricted in that  regard but completely allowed to ban
_J6A7fAwUTk,3591839,3597920,abortion 20 years ago of course that  wouldn't be the case so we've had a
_J6A7fAwUTk,3597920,3603920,absolute change as as as nancy pelosi  said and as you were suggesting in terms
_J6A7fAwUTk,3603920,3610720,of what we expect to be decided um by  the supreme court  what we think is in the constitution
_J6A7fAwUTk,3610720,3615920,versus what we allow our state  legislatures to choose and decide but  rebecca isn't sort of the counter
_J6A7fAwUTk,3615920,3622000,argument to that that the right to bear  arms is explicitly laid out in the  constitution versus
_J6A7fAwUTk,3622000,3627040,as this decision concluded the right to  abortion is not it is it is a hundred
_J6A7fAwUTk,3627040,3633839,percent and as i was saying you know  history rules in these two decisions the  um language text and original meaning of
_J6A7fAwUTk,3633839,3641200,the constitution is the way that we  determine this going forward it looks  like that given the conservative  majority on the supreme court however it
_J6A7fAwUTk,3641200,3646240,isn't the only way to interpret the  constitution and there have been rival  ways of interpreting the constitution
_J6A7fAwUTk,3646240,3653200,that take into account not just where we  once were but the but how to preserve  the values that the um
_J6A7fAwUTk,3653200,3658880,founders and framers of our constitution  had in the current world that we live in  and so that would be a different way to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3658880,3665359,go it's not one that this that this  court is interested in but you know you  could imagine a very different uh a very
_J6A7fAwUTk,3665359,3670640,different interpretation and plus you  know i think one thing that we haven't  focused on in this conversation yet is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3670640,3676319,the legitimacy of the court because one  of the the points that the dissent makes  is by
_J6A7fAwUTk,3676319,3681359,by reversing a decision especially a  decision that extends rights as
_J6A7fAwUTk,3681359,3686640,professor littman was pointing out um we  are essentially
_J6A7fAwUTk,3686640,3691680,saying that the court once it but has a  different makeup ideological makeup will
_J6A7fAwUTk,3691680,3699040,make a different decision and the the  legitimacy of the court depends on this  idea this notion that it is doing
_J6A7fAwUTk,3699040,3706160,something other than politics we are not  naive we all know that the court  that there is some ideological influence
_J6A7fAwUTk,3706160,3711680,but that it is driven by  principles of interpretation by
_J6A7fAwUTk,3711680,3718960,constitutional  by the constitution the terms of the  constitution  and and the court did make a big effort
_J6A7fAwUTk,3718960,3725200,using originalism to make it seem as if  that's what it's doing but by reversing  a decision that was made by a different
_J6A7fAwUTk,3725200,3731520,set of justices it does a significant  amount of damage i think to the to the  court that was already suffering a
_J6A7fAwUTk,3731520,3737440,legitimacy crisis  um we want to bring in nancy corder  she's standing by at the white house
_J6A7fAwUTk,3737440,3742640,nancy any reaction from the white house  what are the options now for the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3742640,3746078,administration moving forward
_J6A7fAwUTk,3748319,3754400,we're going to hear from the president  at some point today that could come soon  that we haven't gotten exact details
_J6A7fAwUTk,3754400,3760640,from the white house yet we've been told  in recent days that he would certainly  have a reaction when this ruling was
_J6A7fAwUTk,3760640,3767359,handed down  they've also said that he wants to put  forth executive action in response to
_J6A7fAwUTk,3767359,3773599,this ruling but they have not given us  details about what exactly that would  look like the president himself saying
_J6A7fAwUTk,3773599,3780079,last month  that not only does he want to issue  executive actions if the right to an
_J6A7fAwUTk,3780079,3785760,abortion is curtailed in this country  but then also he thinks that such a  ruling would spark what he called a mini
_J6A7fAwUTk,3785760,3793520,revolution essentially people going to  the ballot box in november and voting  out anti-abortion rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,3793520,3800160,lawmakers who are applauding this  decision today  let me just run down if you like some of
_J6A7fAwUTk,3800160,3806400,the options that are on the table for  this president when it comes to things  that he could do
_J6A7fAwUTk,3806400,3812799,to make up for the gaps that will be  left in many states if  abortion is banned in those states and
_J6A7fAwUTk,3812799,3818480,let me just say at the outset that none  of this is going to be able to fully  counteract abortions in various states
_J6A7fAwUTk,3818480,3824880,but it could  help women get to other states where  they can get an abortion more easily
_J6A7fAwUTk,3824880,3831039,first of all  he's being urged to drop fda  restrictions that currently limit which
_J6A7fAwUTk,3831039,3836720,pharmacies can sell  abortion pills right now pharmacies need
_J6A7fAwUTk,3836720,3841920,special  licenses to be able to dispense those  pills abortion rights activists would
_J6A7fAwUTk,3841920,3848000,like the fda to do away with those  restrictions so abortion pills are more  readily available
_J6A7fAwUTk,3848000,3853599,there are others who have pushed him to  find a way to issue travel vouchers for
_J6A7fAwUTk,3853599,3859280,people who have to cross state lines to  get an abortion  there are individuals who've been
_J6A7fAwUTk,3859280,3865200,lobbying the pentagon to give service  members leave to get an abortion in
_J6A7fAwUTk,3865200,3870880,another state if they are stationed in a  state that doesn't allow abortions
_J6A7fAwUTk,3870880,3877039,and they're even considering whether  people could get abortions on federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,3877039,3882319,lands in states that ban abortions  whether that's something that would be
_J6A7fAwUTk,3882319,3887359,practical and legal so  all of this is kind of being considered
_J6A7fAwUTk,3887359,3892559,but the white house has been  really keeping mum on exactly what it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,3892559,3899200,that the president would do and we're  now we're just now getting word that it  is official that president biden will be
_J6A7fAwUTk,3899200,3904880,speaking at 12 30 eastern time so uh  just in about an hour and 15 minutes
_J6A7fAwUTk,3904880,3910480,we'll be hearing from the president of  the united states i should point out  that his democratic predecessor
_J6A7fAwUTk,3910480,3916000,president barack obama has already  spoken out  he says that the supreme court not only
_J6A7fAwUTk,3916000,3921760,reversed nearly 50 years of precedent  but it also relegated the most intensely
_J6A7fAwUTk,3921760,3927280,personal decision someone can make to  the whims of politicians and ideologues
_J6A7fAwUTk,3927280,3932799,attacking the essential freedoms of  millions of americans i think you're  going to hear something
_J6A7fAwUTk,3932799,3938480,very similar  along the same lines when we hear from  president biden in a little over an hour
_J6A7fAwUTk,3938480,3944559,nancy cordes is our chief white house  correspondent giving us the latest from  the administration there we want to jump
_J6A7fAwUTk,3944559,3951039,over now to our chief um washington  correspondent major garrett who is  outside the supreme court and was there
_J6A7fAwUTk,3951039,3958720,as this decision was made the supreme  court ending the constitutional right to  abortion major what are you seeing and
_J6A7fAwUTk,3958720,3965839,hearing from the very impassioned crowd  where you are  so it is impassioned crowd that is true
_J6A7fAwUTk,3965839,3972400,but it is smaller than most washington  protests i want to emphasize that maybe  400 maybe 500 i would say equally
_J6A7fAwUTk,3972400,3978960,divided among those who have long  opposed abortion rights and those who  are here to vocally support them what's
_J6A7fAwUTk,3978960,3985280,most important is and we're about an  hour and 15 minutes into this remade  judicial landscape in america the
_J6A7fAwUTk,3985280,3990559,protests have been i would describe them  as subdued and entirely peaceful now
_J6A7fAwUTk,3990559,3996799,there's a couple of reasons for that  peaceable nature there is a very very  large police presence here u.s capitol
_J6A7fAwUTk,3996799,4003200,police  metropolitan police supreme court police  and of course the supreme court itself
_J6A7fAwUTk,4003200,4008480,delivered this landmark opinion from  within a fortress you can see that  fortress
_J6A7fAwUTk,4008480,4013680,alignment behind me  there's a very large about eight foot  black fence surrounding the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,4013680,4020400,court that in front of that  bike fences if you will so there's a  double perimeter protecting this court
_J6A7fAwUTk,4020400,4025680,from the very people in this country  upon whom it issued this new ruling
_J6A7fAwUTk,4025680,4032160,remaking as i mentioned a moment ago the  judicial landscape now what i will tell  you is as soon as this opinion came down
_J6A7fAwUTk,4032160,4038480,about 10 minutes after 10 eastern time  those who oppose abortion rights read it
_J6A7fAwUTk,4038480,4044559,quickly and there was a thunderous roar  a cheer from them and then one of our  embedded reporters with them saw that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4044559,4051200,many fell to their knees wept in joy and  those supporting abortion rights were  embittered instantly
_J6A7fAwUTk,4051200,4056480,the crowds i would say have grown a  little bit in the intervening hour and  15 minutes i think there are a good
_J6A7fAwUTk,4056480,4062559,number of curiosity seekers not really  sure what side they're on but they're  coming to see what is quite clearly
_J6A7fAwUTk,4062559,4069200,a moment in judicial history a moment in  political history and one that will have  ramifications not just in the midterm
_J6A7fAwUTk,4069200,4074400,elections  but as america now at a much more  localized level
_J6A7fAwUTk,4074400,4079440,state level city level county level  begins the arduous debate about all the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4079440,4085359,underlying issues and complexities  around abortion  and major i should ask you have you had
_J6A7fAwUTk,4085359,4092720,a chance i don't know to speak to some  of the people in in the crowd what is  their sort of greatest fear
_J6A7fAwUTk,4092960,4098880,so i have not been able to move from  this position which is on the grassy  area of the united states capital
_J6A7fAwUTk,4098880,4104640,complex the street you see behind me is  first street  but i did see one particular person who
_J6A7fAwUTk,4104640,4110000,i've seen before because i've covered  this issue off and on for many many  years randall terry randall terry is
_J6A7fAwUTk,4110000,4116960,head of an organization called operation  rescue he has been arrested he reminded  me hundreds upon hundreds of times at
_J6A7fAwUTk,4116960,4122238,protests on opposing abortion rights he  was here at the supreme court steps when
_J6A7fAwUTk,4122238,4127758,the webster decision was handed out in  1989 he was on the steps of the supreme  court when the casey decision was handed
_J6A7fAwUTk,4127758,4133520,in 1992  and he stood just to the left of our  camera position because he decided that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4133520,4140960,we were the best source of information  for him and as soon as i told him what  the court  had decided he let out a roar of thanks
_J6A7fAwUTk,4140960,4146400,and said i've been waiting for this my  entire life wow i've advocated for this  my entire
_J6A7fAwUTk,4146400,4152880,life  and he said it with not only a degree of  passion but a kind of mixture of joy and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4152880,4159520,anguish  so that's one side of this issue i can  tell you listening to the rhetoric from  those who support abortion rights who
_J6A7fAwUTk,4159520,4165040,are behind me  they are describing the court as  essentially to their mind representing a
_J6A7fAwUTk,4165040,4170318,fascist theocracy  that is imposing a theocratic will
_J6A7fAwUTk,4170318,4177600,against the will of the american people  and deciding or proclaiming that what  america needs now is a their words not
_J6A7fAwUTk,4177600,4182798,mine pro-choice revolution  the rhetoric i must tell you is intense
_J6A7fAwUTk,4182798,4189040,and strident  but the activity has been peaceable  and full-throated but nothing violent
_J6A7fAwUTk,4189040,4194560,nothing even near violent and i think it  is fair to say  the police in the crowd and a raid
_J6A7fAwUTk,4194560,4199920,around them are trying to guarantee that  it remains just that way  major garrett reporting outside the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4199920,4206560,supreme court where moments ago the  justices decided the constitution does  not offer the right to abortion let's
_J6A7fAwUTk,4206560,4213600,bring in jeff rosen he's a cbs news  constitutional expert jeff we heard from  major there that there is passion joy
_J6A7fAwUTk,4213600,4218640,anguish  outside the supreme court the entire  range of emotions from those who both
_J6A7fAwUTk,4218640,4224719,support and have been vehemently against  this type of ruling the justices though  not seeming to allude to any of that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4224719,4230400,emotion and what is such a personal  decision for any woman who decides to go  through this
_J6A7fAwUTk,4230400,4237360,what's your reaction to the  the thinking laid out in this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,4237360,4244000,there was some allusion to the emotion  of the decision in the dissenting  opinion where justice breyer justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,4244000,4249360,sotomayor and justice taken quoted the  court's claim in casey that the american
_J6A7fAwUTk,4249360,4255840,people's belief in the rule of law  itself would be shaken by overturning  roe and that a decision over ruling role
_J6A7fAwUTk,4255840,4261040,under fire would be perceived as a  surrender to political pressure
_J6A7fAwUTk,4261040,4267679,the what struck what's so striking about  the dissent is it does acknowledge the  national debate and calls out the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4267679,4273280,majority  of forcibly for the implications of its  decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,4273280,4278800,the dissent says the majority claims  don't worry about  same-sex marriage about the right to
_J6A7fAwUTk,4278800,4285040,contraception about other intimate  privacy rights good luck it says in  relying on the majority's premise
_J6A7fAwUTk,4285040,4291679,suggesting that the liberal  justices believe that  the conservatives have
_J6A7fAwUTk,4291679,4297840,gone further than  they ever expected in changing the law  of abortion it's there's so much to say
_J6A7fAwUTk,4297840,4304719,about this case your your conversation  so far has been really deep and  illuminating but it i i'm just struck at
_J6A7fAwUTk,4304719,4309760,this particular moment by the poignancy  of chief justice roberts's lone
_J6A7fAwUTk,4309760,4314880,concurring opinion which merits only a  sentence in the dissent that the the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4314880,4321920,dissenting justices say well the chief  was trying to come up with this  compromise we disagree with that too  he's he's now on the sidelines of this
_J6A7fAwUTk,4321920,4327120,passionately divided court in all of his  efforts for the past 10 years and more
_J6A7fAwUTk,4327120,4335280,to preserve the legitimacy of the court  by convincing both sides to converge  around moderate compromises is now uh up
_J6A7fAwUTk,4335280,4340400,in uh shambles and it's there's a  poignancy and and for for any american
_J6A7fAwUTk,4340400,4345520,who cares about the nonpartisan  legitimacy of the court  a real tragedy to that aspect of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4345520,4353520,court's decision yeah rebecca when you  were talking about that that's exactly  what i was thinking was that the chief  justice is usually the one who tries to
_J6A7fAwUTk,4353520,4359920,manage that  tries to make sure that the supreme  court does not appear too political and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4359920,4365199,in this case he sided with  the with the majority yeah i just want  to read this
_J6A7fAwUTk,4365199,4371520,language from the dissent which i think  is so well written um and it really is  about this point which is the legitimacy
_J6A7fAwUTk,4371520,4376560,of the court so referring to the notion  of upholding precedent the the court the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4376560,4381760,dissent rights the justices who wrote  those words o'connor kennedy and suter
_J6A7fAwUTk,4381760,4388080,they were judges of wisdom they would  not have won any contests for the kind  of ideological purity that court
_J6A7fAwUTk,4388080,4395520,watchers want justices to deliver but if  there were awards for justices who left  this court better than they found it and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4395520,4403440,who for that reason left this country  better and the rule of law stronger sign  those justices up so the point of that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4403440,4409120,quote is that  we can have these battles these  political battles but this court is with
_J6A7fAwUTk,4409120,4415679,us and the importance of  of maintaining the  faith in that institution and the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4415679,4421440,integrity of that institution transcends  these ideological divides and so by
_J6A7fAwUTk,4421440,4427840,doing this by reversing the precedent  maybe it was wrong when it was decided  right i think that you know a lot of
_J6A7fAwUTk,4427840,4435040,people would agree it kind of came out  of thin air but once it's there it's  nine justices opinions about what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4435040,4442800,constitution says to just say we now  disagree is something that really is a  kind of radical move um by conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,4442800,4449120,justices and we don't usually hear those  two terms in the same in the same  sentence but it is right conservativism
_J6A7fAwUTk,4449120,4455840,is usually um or at least a brand of  conservativism is incrementalism and law  is incremental the supreme court is
_J6A7fAwUTk,4455840,4462400,supposed to be incremental and it is not  incremental to do this now i know you  know people compare this to plessy which
_J6A7fAwUTk,4462400,4469840,is which was  the supreme court case that allowed  segregation and said you know we reverse  that well sure but this is a different
_J6A7fAwUTk,4469840,4477920,you know this is about  building up rights as opposed to plessy  which was a case which was about um
_J6A7fAwUTk,4477920,4484719,denying certain rights to people so it  really is different and in any case it  ought to be reserved very seldom situ
_J6A7fAwUTk,4484719,4491440,very very seldom should the court ever  do that so rapidly especially on an  issue in which the public is so divided
_J6A7fAwUTk,4491440,4496640,um i want to ask sort of jessica  levinson to sort of bounce off of what  uh you just said rebecca because we
_J6A7fAwUTk,4496640,4501599,haven't heard from her what's your take  on on what rebecca just said
_J6A7fAwUTk,4502000,4508880,so i think that's right to focus in on  this idea of starry decisis and i keep  thinking back to all of the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,4508880,4514080,court confirmation hearings where if you  know one case it's roe v wade and if
_J6A7fAwUTk,4514080,4520640,there's one case that the senators are  going to ask about over and over again  it's this idea of do you respect that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4520640,4527600,roe v wade is settled law and everybody  says some version of yes  and that's in part because
_J6A7fAwUTk,4527600,4534080,many of these nominees have been court  of appeals justices and so precedent is  binding on them
_J6A7fAwUTk,4534080,4539280,but they never say the next sentence  which is and when you're on the supreme  court
_J6A7fAwUTk,4539280,4544880,would you in all cases say  this is starry decisis under every
_J6A7fAwUTk,4544880,4553040,factor of starry decisis we will not  overturn the decision and that's what we  don't see and today what we see i think
_J6A7fAwUTk,4553040,4559840,is the fruition of this conservative  legal movement where we've picked  justices and elections matter where
_J6A7fAwUTk,4559840,4566640,we've picked justices who as i said have  been waiting decades to make this  decision now i did want to pick up on a
_J6A7fAwUTk,4566640,4572719,couple of the previous points that you  talked about one is this question that i  keep getting what happens to other
_J6A7fAwUTk,4572719,4577920,rights and i know you've touched on it  before i know rebecca talked about it  leo talked about it and it's this idea
_J6A7fAwUTk,4577920,4585520,of what about the other rights that are  not written in the constitution  and if it's gay marriage it's the right
_J6A7fAwUTk,4585520,4591679,to marry somebody maybe of a different  race for instance  and it's the idea that we have a right
_J6A7fAwUTk,4591679,4598640,to contraception even though it doesn't  say in the constitution there's a right  to contraception justice alito has a
_J6A7fAwUTk,4598640,4605600,line in the opinion as he did in the  leaked draft where he says this is just  about abortion don't worry because when
_J6A7fAwUTk,4605600,4611440,it comes to gay marriage when it comes  to marrying somebody of the opposite  race when it comes to contraception the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4611440,4617199,potential of life is not at issue but if  you look at the legal reasoning behind
_J6A7fAwUTk,4617199,4623920,why he's striking down roe v wade and  planned parenthood versus casey i would  say if you honestly look at the legal
_J6A7fAwUTk,4623920,4630080,reasoning you have to look at justice  thomas's concurrence which says all of  the us other rights should go under
_J6A7fAwUTk,4630080,4637120,substantive due process where we're  protecting these unenumerated unlisted  rights then all of them should go and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4637120,4643120,that's one of the things we have to look  at in the next two years five years 10  years what does this very conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,4643120,4648320,court do with respect to those other  rights the other thing i wanted to pick  up on you had that great conversation
_J6A7fAwUTk,4648320,4655760,with leah where people said basically  they want the president to act they want  the president to do something and he has
_J6A7fAwUTk,4655760,4661120,gotten no traction with congress so what  does that leave him it leaves him with  executive orders
_J6A7fAwUTk,4661120,4666480,we should look for as you have the  discussion we should look for some  movement with respect to
_J6A7fAwUTk,4666480,4673280,abortion pills and whether or not the  president issues an executive order to  say it should be easier to get abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,4673280,4680400,pills and look for this whether or not  when the federal government says you can  obtain abortion pills that preempts and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4680400,4687199,is supreme over any state that tries to  ban the mailing or prescription of  abortion pills because and i'll end with
_J6A7fAwUTk,4687199,4694159,this we know now that over 50 percent of  abortions in this country  are in fact a result of abortion pills
_J6A7fAwUTk,4694159,4701280,if we can get  language in an executive order and if  that language is upheld that says states
_J6A7fAwUTk,4701280,4706880,cannot ban abortion pills that is a  really big deal it doesn't oh it doesn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,4706880,4712560,lessen  the blow of this decision it doesn't  totally change it but it's a big deal if
_J6A7fAwUTk,4712560,4719120,that happens so many important threads  to this jessica levinson thank you  joining us now is michigan governor
_J6A7fAwUTk,4719120,4725360,gretchen whitmer  governor you have said in a statement  that you will fight like hell direct
_J6A7fAwUTk,4725360,4731360,quote there to protect every  michiganders right to make decisions  about their body but as of right now as
_J6A7fAwUTk,4731360,4737520,you note in your statement it is now  illegal to have an abortion in michigan  unless there is a case of of incest or
_J6A7fAwUTk,4737520,4743280,rape what's your response to this  supreme court decision and what will you  do next uh to be a woman of your word
_J6A7fAwUTk,4743280,4749040,here  well this is a devastating setback for  women for our economy for our ability to
_J6A7fAwUTk,4749040,4754960,lead families and make decisions around  our health care and participate in the  economy this is going to have massive
_J6A7fAwUTk,4754960,4760480,impact and so we are fighting like hell  i have filed a lawsuit there i'm hoping
_J6A7fAwUTk,4760480,4766239,that our supreme court understands the  urgency of taking action  now so we're going to continue to push
_J6A7fAwUTk,4766239,4773520,on that front planned parenthood and  aclu also filed a lawsuit and got an  injunction against the 1931 law that
_J6A7fAwUTk,4773520,4780000,makes it a felony no exceptions for rape  or incest so at this point  michigan women still have access to
_J6A7fAwUTk,4780000,4786480,abortion care but this injunction is in  the process of being appealed so it's a  precarious moment and that's why we've
_J6A7fAwUTk,4786480,4793120,got to continue this fight yeah governor  you know we've been talking about these  sort of trigger laws and michigan is in  this unique place in that you had sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,4793120,4798800,of a trigger law before we started  talking about it these things being  implemented this 1931
_J6A7fAwUTk,4798800,4805520,law and so you've already been through  this battle really in your state you  mentioned the injunction
_J6A7fAwUTk,4805520,4811760,you know what is your concern  about what could happen if if there is
_J6A7fAwUTk,4811760,4818400,an appeal and this injunction is lifted  and this 1931 law 1931
_J6A7fAwUTk,4818400,4824560,law  becomes the law of your state  you know like mothers and fathers
_J6A7fAwUTk,4824560,4832159,everywhere i'm thinking about my  daughters  they now have fewer rights than i've had  my whole life and i am incensed about
_J6A7fAwUTk,4832159,4838159,this the most important economic  decision a woman will make in her  lifetime is when
_J6A7fAwUTk,4838159,4845120,and whether to start a family and now  this supreme court ruling has said every  state's going to have different rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,4845120,4850480,for women in their state borders and in  michigan we will go from being a  pro-choice state
_J6A7fAwUTk,4850480,4858000,if this 1931 law goes into effect or if  anyone who's running for governor on the  republican side is successful
_J6A7fAwUTk,4858000,4864880,we will have the most extreme law on the  books in the country my legislators  already introduced bills to throw
_J6A7fAwUTk,4864880,4871520,doctors and nurses in jail for a decade  obviously i will veto that disgusting
_J6A7fAwUTk,4871520,4878800,next step that they want to take but  this is how precarious this moment is  and this is why we must win we must
_J6A7fAwUTk,4878800,4886239,continue to fight and we've got to  ensure that all people have access to  the full range of health care that we
_J6A7fAwUTk,4886239,4891920,have had for the last 49 years who in  your state are you concerned about the
_J6A7fAwUTk,4891920,4898239,most we already know the us has the  highest maternal mortality rate of  developed nations
_J6A7fAwUTk,4898239,4903360,who in your state right now  um is most at risk
_J6A7fAwUTk,4903360,4908480,well obviously you know laws like this  take a disproportionate impact on people
_J6A7fAwUTk,4908480,4914000,with fewer resources right all the black  and brown communities people in rural
_J6A7fAwUTk,4914000,4920639,parts of our state who currently don't  have close enough access now we'll have  to either amass the resources to leave
_J6A7fAwUTk,4920639,4925840,the state or carry an unwanted unplanned  pregnancy to term
_J6A7fAwUTk,4925840,4931840,this is going to have a devastating  impact you know all across the country  employers are saying we got to get women
_J6A7fAwUTk,4931840,4938480,back in the workplace this covid19 sent  women home because they had to take care  of families and take care of business
_J6A7fAwUTk,4938480,4944400,and etc this is one more hurdle for  women to participate if we don't even
_J6A7fAwUTk,4944400,4950320,have the ability to design our lives to  make our decisions and access the  reproductive health care that we've had
_J6A7fAwUTk,4950320,4956719,for 49 years so this will have an impact  most devastatingly on people with fewer  resources
_J6A7fAwUTk,4956719,4962719,you know you say that abortions at least  right now are currently legal in in  michigan and you're going to fight like  hell to keep it that way
_J6A7fAwUTk,4962719,4969360,is michigan also sort of preparing for  uh you know people who live in states  where they they may not have access and
_J6A7fAwUTk,4969360,4975920,you may see people coming into your  state looking for an abortion  yeah currently in michigan women from
_J6A7fAwUTk,4975920,4982960,ohio and indiana come here for  reproductive health care  it is something that you know i am i am
_J6A7fAwUTk,4982960,4990080,glad that we've been able to be a place  where women could access just across  state line but the problem with this now
_J6A7fAwUTk,4990080,4997600,50 state  patchwork of rights is going to just be  confusing it's going to create complete
_J6A7fAwUTk,4997600,5002639,barriers for a lot of people and it's  going to  permanently change the trajectory of
_J6A7fAwUTk,5002639,5010320,women's lives in this country and that's  what i think is so alarming about the  reach of this particular ruling which
_J6A7fAwUTk,5010320,5015520,could have uh implications beyond  abortion and reproductive choice but
_J6A7fAwUTk,5015520,5021199,obviously that's what we're focusing on  right now because that is what's  squarely at risk here for so many of us
_J6A7fAwUTk,5021199,5026719,and governor just in our last few  moments with you this is the second  seismic supreme court decision in as
_J6A7fAwUTk,5026719,5033040,many days also having an impact on your  state ruling yesterday striking down new  york's effort to put kind of limitations
_J6A7fAwUTk,5033040,5041840,and restrictions on how people can seek  um  permits for weapons what's your response  to to that major supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,5041840,5047440,well the supreme court is showing that  they have an agenda and they are
_J6A7fAwUTk,5047440,5054800,hypocritical in terms of how they apply  that agenda based on who they care about  and they've made america a lot more
_J6A7fAwUTk,5054800,5061679,dangerous just in the last 48 hours  governor gretchen whitmer thank you so  much for spending time with us
_J6A7fAwUTk,5061679,5066880,thank you  you really get a sense that  all across the united states right now
_J6A7fAwUTk,5066880,5072960,that this is this is a heavy emotive  moment no matter what side of this  debate that you're on because it is such
_J6A7fAwUTk,5072960,5079440,a definitive decision and i think you  know also there's an incredible level of  uncertainty right um
_J6A7fAwUTk,5079440,5084960,the fight is actually not over  and i think michigan is a perfect  example of that they have this 1931 law
_J6A7fAwUTk,5084960,5090719,that was already on the books that  banned virtually all abortion so they  had been fighting to ensure that that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5090719,5097120,law would not be implemented should roe  v wade be overturned which is you know  where they are now um
_J6A7fAwUTk,5097120,5102560,but  as we were talking earlier there are now  all sorts of trigger laws across the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5102560,5107840,country that will then be challenged  right are they constitutional laws that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5107840,5113520,you know that could potentially  um prosecute people who cross state  lines or if you help someone get an
_J6A7fAwUTk,5113520,5118800,abortion is that enforceable  the the the fight over this is far from
_J6A7fAwUTk,5118800,5126480,over and it really may be just beginning  um i guess you know jessica um you're  standing by so i will ask you if you
_J6A7fAwUTk,5126480,5132000,agree with my assertion that the fight  may be just beginning here
_J6A7fAwUTk,5134560,5141120,or perhaps i apologize is that to me  is it jessica  or leah or anyone who is suggested
_J6A7fAwUTk,5141120,5148239,actually  okay yeah jessica so yes  absolutely so yes i think the fight is
_J6A7fAwUTk,5148239,5155040,beginning and we're going to see a fight  on the federal level between the federal  government and states we're going to see
_J6A7fAwUTk,5155040,5160719,a fight state to state and so this is  something that you and i have talked  about on the air before but i think one
_J6A7fAwUTk,5160719,5166400,of the things we're going to look at  next is that we will have i'm talking to  you from california we will have blue
_J6A7fAwUTk,5166400,5173440,states that try to expand the right to  obtain an abortion not just for our  residents but to say to women in other
_J6A7fAwUTk,5173440,5180080,states yes you can come in we will  provide the resources we will provide  money for travel maybe and we will
_J6A7fAwUTk,5180080,5186639,provide more money for abortion  providers and then one of the big legal  battles coming up is we will see states
_J6A7fAwUTk,5186639,5193199,like missouri maybe other red states  where what they're trying to do is not  just ban abortion within their
_J6A7fAwUTk,5193199,5198400,boundaries but they're also trying to  ban women from traveling to obtain an
_J6A7fAwUTk,5198400,5203920,abortion we've already seen states like  connecticut react to those proposed bans
_J6A7fAwUTk,5203920,5211360,on travel and say  you we will not cooperate with any  authorities that try to prosecute an
_J6A7fAwUTk,5211360,5217600,abortion provider or penalize a woman  for obtaining for traveling here to  obtain an abortion and in fact you can
_J6A7fAwUTk,5217600,5224080,even counter sue for damages so we're  going to have this is not the end of the  fight we're going to have big fights
_J6A7fAwUTk,5224080,5230080,between we talked about for instance  abortion pills and whether or not states  can ban those that's going to be a
_J6A7fAwUTk,5230080,5235280,federal government versus state issue  and then we're going to have this big  issue of state to state one of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5235280,5241760,things to look for whether or not states  can tell their residents which i don't  think they can can you in fact be
_J6A7fAwUTk,5241760,5248320,prevented from traveling to another  state to obtain an abortion  and then within states we'll be looking
_J6A7fAwUTk,5248320,5254080,to see whether or not states will either  like california change their  constitution there's a proposal right
_J6A7fAwUTk,5254080,5261280,now in california to change the  constitution to say we will protect the  right to obtain an abortion or will
_J6A7fAwUTk,5261280,5268000,states that don't have the trigger law  now completely ban abortion and then  long term what's the next thing to look
_J6A7fAwUTk,5268000,5274080,for will a conservative movement try and  push either legislation or a case that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5274080,5280800,says  abortion cannot be allowed by any state  that is the in some ways logical next
_J6A7fAwUTk,5280800,5287280,step of the conservative movement not to  leave it to the states but to deprive  the states of that decision jessica
_J6A7fAwUTk,5287280,5292320,levinson providing her insight on this  seismic supreme court decision we now
_J6A7fAwUTk,5292320,5300000,want to bring in dr bavik kumar he's  with the planned parenthood center for  choice in houston texas um dr kumar you
_J6A7fAwUTk,5300000,5306800,know  in detail what has happened in texas  which has effectively forced people to
_J6A7fAwUTk,5306800,5313199,coordinate through an underground  network in order to get access to um  these types of rights and cares tell us
_J6A7fAwUTk,5313199,5319040,more about that  yeah in texas for the last almost 10  months now we haven't really had access
_J6A7fAwUTk,5319040,5324960,to abortion and we've been able to help  some folks but thousands of people  unfortunately have been able to have
_J6A7fAwUTk,5324960,5332000,been forced to get care out of state  which is very difficult to do it  requires a lot of money a lot of  logistical planning taking time off of
_J6A7fAwUTk,5332000,5337440,work finding child care finding a clinic  that can provide this care and having  the means to be able to do all that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5337440,5343360,which is not easy so what we've also  seen in texas over the last 10 months is  a lot of folks saying we just can't make
_J6A7fAwUTk,5343360,5348800,that journey it's not possible and  instead they've been forced to carry  pregnancies to term that can potentially
_J6A7fAwUTk,5348800,5354239,be unsafe for them um and have children  that they know that they can't care for  and with this decision today we're
_J6A7fAwUTk,5354239,5360560,looking at that happening in potentially  26 states in our country now can you  just remind us of the laws that are
_J6A7fAwUTk,5360560,5367040,currently on the books in uh in texas um  and and why abortion is so limited now
_J6A7fAwUTk,5367040,5372159,because texas uh sort of wrote a very  for lack of a better word a clever law
_J6A7fAwUTk,5372159,5377440,that um  made it difficult um made it difficult  for
_J6A7fAwUTk,5377440,5383840,uh i mean difficult  what's the phrase you know what doctor  i'm going to let you explain it because  it was a clever law that allowed for
_J6A7fAwUTk,5383840,5388880,citizens to  go after anyone who helps someone get an
_J6A7fAwUTk,5388880,5395280,abortion  yeah so just to back up a little bit  over the last decade plus we've had
_J6A7fAwUTk,5395280,5401120,numerous restrictions that have been  passed we have a mandatory 24-hour delay  a ban on you using any kind of insurance
_J6A7fAwUTk,5401120,5408000,including medicaid to cover the cost of  your care uh laws specific to minors  identification requirements burdens on
_J6A7fAwUTk,5408000,5413360,the clinic that actually provide this  care that are unique to the places that  provide abortion care but what you're
_J6A7fAwUTk,5413360,5420080,referencing is senate bill 8 which was  passed last september  and that bans abortion when somebody has
_J6A7fAwUTk,5420080,5426159,an ultrasound where cardiac motion can  be detected at an ultrasound which is  can be earlier six weeks and we've seen
_J6A7fAwUTk,5426159,5431440,uh personally i've seen in taking care  of people that can be as early as five  weeks in a few days which is only about
_J6A7fAwUTk,5431440,5436800,10 days after somebody might miss their  menstrual period which is very very  early then you have to find a clinic get
_J6A7fAwUTk,5436800,5442320,into the clinic wait that 24 hours and  hopefully you still qualify for an  abortion which essentially makes it very
_J6A7fAwUTk,5442320,5447920,difficult if not impossible for most  people to get the care that they need  and doctor we should highlight those who
_J6A7fAwUTk,5447920,5454159,have have been supporters of these  restrictions many it's for religious  reasons many find it a deep part of
_J6A7fAwUTk,5454159,5460239,their faith um they find abortion  antithetical um to that millions of  people across the country in these
_J6A7fAwUTk,5460239,5466800,well-funded efforts to kind of have that  codified in law  meanwhile though you work with some of
_J6A7fAwUTk,5466800,5472239,the most vulnerable in texas who are at  risk what what are some of the worst
_J6A7fAwUTk,5472239,5478800,outcomes so we can just put this in  context for our viewers of what happens  when women do not have access young
_J6A7fAwUTk,5478800,5484880,vulnerable women to this type of care  and prevention  yeah sure i've been doing this work now
_J6A7fAwUTk,5484880,5491040,for about seven years in texas and we  also know that religious folks whether  they're catholic christian muslim hindu
_J6A7fAwUTk,5491040,5496880,have abortions there are folks that are  religious in support of abortion access  the vast majority of folks do and we
_J6A7fAwUTk,5496880,5502239,have to keep that at center when folks  don't have access to the care that they  need whether it's through an abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,5502239,5507679,ban or because they're not able to  access it through  because of the numerous restrictions  that i just mentioned it doesn't change
_J6A7fAwUTk,5507679,5513679,their need for care and i think in this  moment it's important to look to other  countries whether it's poland ireland el
_J6A7fAwUTk,5513679,5520000,salvador where abortion has been banned  and we've seen recently folks have died  folks have not been able to get the care
_J6A7fAwUTk,5520000,5526719,that they need when we look at the  statistics in those countries we see  that people are having higher rates of  maternal mortality and that's what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5526719,5532960,future looks like in this country we  also have to think about some of the  things that have just been mentioned as  far as folks being criminalized and
_J6A7fAwUTk,5532960,5539360,prosecuted for having miscarriages  taking care of their own pregnancies and  unfortunately in this country which i
_J6A7fAwUTk,5539360,5544480,thought was a free country we're facing  that future now  dr barbara kumar with the planned
_J6A7fAwUTk,5544480,5550719,parenthood center for choice in houston  texas thanks for joining us we'll  continue our discussion of this with our
_J6A7fAwUTk,5550719,5557440,legal analyst we've got rebecca royfee  we have jessica levinson  anne marie green we've all been watching  this happen in real time
_J6A7fAwUTk,5557440,5563360,thank you doctor um  rebecca what now  well you know i think one of the things
_J6A7fAwUTk,5563360,5568639,that we've been highlighting is the  question of remaining rights and what's  going to happen with those rights and i
_J6A7fAwUTk,5568639,5575600,think it's worth highlighting just again  how there is some controversy on the  court about how
_J6A7fAwUTk,5575600,5580960,the reasoning will apply to these other  sorts of cases and you see that justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,5580960,5587199,thomas said he saw that there should be  no basis for rights including the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5587199,5593280,right to gay marriage the right to  contraception that those two fall just
_J6A7fAwUTk,5593280,5599280,as roe fell and then you see justice  kavanaugh trying to suggest that no this
_J6A7fAwUTk,5599280,5604400,reasoning doesn't extend that law that  far because it's different and in the in
_J6A7fAwUTk,5604400,5610800,the descent there's an important  language where they actually point out  no this reasoning does include those
_J6A7fAwUTk,5610800,5617520,rights as well and if you're trying to  carve them out then you're not you're  being intellectually disingenuous so the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5617520,5622880,reason why i think that's important to  point out is it because it goes to this  other part of our discussion about
_J6A7fAwUTk,5622880,5628400,precedent because if this were obviously  wrongly decided like it was you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,5628400,5634400,then maybe there would be some  justification but  then all these rights go and here you
_J6A7fAwUTk,5634400,5641040,see the supreme court pretending that  they're just reading the constitution  suggesting that something can from
_J6A7fAwUTk,5641040,5648239,history can tell us exactly how this  document ought to be read when that's  just impossible we're always going to be
_J6A7fAwUTk,5648239,5655440,using some judgment  and so what that judgment ought to be  i'm not sure and it is their job to do
_J6A7fAwUTk,5655440,5661920,it but to suggest that some other judges  who decided this case just 50 years ago
_J6A7fAwUTk,5661920,5667360,made the wrong judgment is problematic  from the perspective of the ongoing
_J6A7fAwUTk,5667360,5674400,legitimacy of this institution and so  you know i think that that's one of the  real takeaways and a way to wrap up some
_J6A7fAwUTk,5674400,5680320,of the conversations that we were having  together that you know of course  different justices are going to disagree
_J6A7fAwUTk,5680320,5686239,about the meaning of this text and for  that reason we need to defer in order to  have some legitimacy on this court and
_J6A7fAwUTk,5686239,5691760,incremental  change in this country that doesn't  ignite these kind of ideological wars we
_J6A7fAwUTk,5691760,5697520,need to have a little bit more respect  for the institution and respect for  these you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,5697520,5702880,sometimes wrong  accumulation of knowledge rather than  this notion that one set of people have
_J6A7fAwUTk,5702880,5708719,to be absolutely right in their opinion  about what the constitution means i'm  rebecca i love how you said that i
_J6A7fAwUTk,5708719,5714560,really really love how you said that  because i think you know sort of the  feeling is well
_J6A7fAwUTk,5714560,5720719,are you bowing to political pressure and  you're saying no like these changes  should be incremental they should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,5720719,5726159,measured um because we can't have these  vast swings back and forth or else how  will anyone take the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,5726159,5732080,seriously that's how i interpret what  you said i thought it was really  interesting um  uh jessica levinson i want you to sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,5732080,5738560,of chime in on that  absolutely i mean rebecca's hit on  something that's so important which is
_J6A7fAwUTk,5738560,5745840,this idea of why does starry decides  this matter which in plain english means  why does it matter that we respect prior
_J6A7fAwUTk,5745840,5752159,decisions so when we have new justices  they have new views so what's the  problem with every time we get a new
_J6A7fAwUTk,5752159,5758960,justice or a new judge they just  overturn decisions that they don't like  and so let's really talk about why we
_J6A7fAwUTk,5758960,5764000,have this idea that you have to respect  precedent even if maybe when you were on
_J6A7fAwUTk,5764000,5769520,the court when the decision was decided  that you wouldn't have made that call
_J6A7fAwUTk,5769520,5775040,you wouldn't have come to that  conclusion part of the idea is that we  want people to think that the law is
_J6A7fAwUTk,5775040,5782000,predictable the law is something you can  rely on and the law is frankly we want  to keep this i think bit of a fiction
_J6A7fAwUTk,5782000,5787760,that the law is more than just whoever  decides whoever can count to five i mean
_J6A7fAwUTk,5787760,5794080,i was just teaching constitutional law  to my students last night and one of my  students said we were talking about
_J6A7fAwUTk,5794080,5799679,actually the affordable care act and one  of my students said to me  the dissent really seems like they have
_J6A7fAwUTk,5799679,5805679,the right approach here i don't  understand they said because they  couldn't count to five and that's
_J6A7fAwUTk,5805679,5812320,ultimately what it comes down to on the  supreme court that's the most important  thing and we see that today now when it
_J6A7fAwUTk,5812320,5818960,does come to  you know whether or not the court  respects this idea of we have to adhere
_J6A7fAwUTk,5818960,5825920,to prior cases i do think we need to be  careful i mean i personally may not be  in favor of the court's decision today
_J6A7fAwUTk,5825920,5831280,but i also want the court to have the  flexibility to right wrongs and i know
_J6A7fAwUTk,5831280,5837440,that you know that's not that nobody is  contending that but i do think we need
_J6A7fAwUTk,5837440,5843280,to be careful to see that starry decisis  is a set of facts that we look to
_J6A7fAwUTk,5843280,5849440,and it really does allow us to  in some ways just say well the fra the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5849440,5856560,framework is no longer workable the  decision was never rooted in our  traditions one thing i'll note is that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5856560,5862080,both sides of the opinion meaning both  the majority and the descent talk about
_J6A7fAwUTk,5862080,5868400,the importance of respect for the  institution and it's interesting that  the majority says
_J6A7fAwUTk,5868400,5874480,i've gone through all of the factors of  starry decisis but now i have to talk to  you about one more thing and that one
_J6A7fAwUTk,5874480,5880239,more thing is respect for the court and  what the majority really says here is
_J6A7fAwUTk,5880239,5887280,you're not going to have a court that's  respected if they just create and or  uphold rights that have no grounding in
_J6A7fAwUTk,5887280,5894800,this country's  history have no  grounding in this country's tradition no  grounding in this country's case law and
_J6A7fAwUTk,5894800,5900080,so both sides were trying to pick up the  mantle of this decision is the one that
_J6A7fAwUTk,5900080,5906719,actually will be the the decision that  gets the court to  uh find more favor in the eyes of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,5906719,5912320,public or that allows the court to be  seen as more respected  um
_J6A7fAwUTk,5912320,5917760,obviously the country is so divided on  this issue that  really i think this all just comes down
_J6A7fAwUTk,5917760,5923840,to what is your view of abortion not  what not what is your view of starry  decisis yeah that is fascinating we're
_J6A7fAwUTk,5923840,5930000,listening to jessica levinson president  biden we expect to make his remarks on  the supreme court ruling um in just over
_J6A7fAwUTk,5930000,5935280,30 minutes from now we also have some  new video just into cbs news showing um
_J6A7fAwUTk,5935280,5942400,some of the reaction to this decision by  house staffers  some of them walking from uh congress
_J6A7fAwUTk,5942400,5948239,marching across um to where the supreme  court is now to protest this decision i
_J6A7fAwUTk,5948239,5954639,guess the video is not exactly queued up  you can see now um men and women um
_J6A7fAwUTk,5954639,5960239,walking from the house these are  staffers uh you know supreme court's  right next to congress there it's not a
_J6A7fAwUTk,5960239,5966239,long walk but certainly  showing their displeasure to this  decision in their small way as many
_J6A7fAwUTk,5966239,5972000,across the country will be doing yeah  joining the other protesters no doubt in  front of um in front of the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,5972000,5980159,court you know we spoke to major garrett  and he said as far as demonstrations go  in front of the supreme court it's  actually not as large as others i would
_J6A7fAwUTk,5980159,5985520,she he didn't mention this but  i wouldn't be surprised that part of  that reason is because we saw the leaked
_J6A7fAwUTk,5985520,5991040,draft right i mean  people essentially knew that it was  going to go this way there was maybe
_J6A7fAwUTk,5991040,5997440,a feeling that perhaps  the language would be tweaked um but  that certainly wasn't the case it seems
_J6A7fAwUTk,5997440,6004239,like the uh majority decision was  exactly what was leaked and that's his  own story who leaked it why was it yeah
_J6A7fAwUTk,6004239,6009280,because of this or for another reason we  just wanna in our last few minutes i'll  shall show you reaction from house
_J6A7fAwUTk,6009280,6014159,speaker nancy pelosi who had this to say  moments ago
_J6A7fAwUTk,6020960,6027199,republican party their super majority in  the supreme court  american women today have less freedom
_J6A7fAwUTk,6027199,6033119,than their mothers  with roe  and their attempt to destroy it radical
_J6A7fAwUTk,6033119,6039920,republicans are charging ahead with  their crusade to criminalize  health freedom
_J6A7fAwUTk,6039920,6045440,in the congress  be aware of this the republicans
_J6A7fAwUTk,6045440,6050880,are plotting a nationwide abortion ban  they cannot be allowed to have a
_J6A7fAwUTk,6050880,6056239,majority in the congress  to do that  but that's their goal
_J6A7fAwUTk,6056239,6063199,and if you read  and again we're all studying all this  but if you read what is in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,6063199,6069199,very clear  one of the justices had his own
_J6A7fAwUTk,6069199,6076158,statement  it's about  contraception in vitro
_J6A7fAwUTk,6076840,6082320,fertilization family planning  that is all what will spring
_J6A7fAwUTk,6082320,6085840,from their decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,6087840,6093760,speaks to the real emotional weight at  the moment yeah you know this  conversation is is going to be going on  and on and on there's a lot to talk
_J6A7fAwUTk,6093760,6099600,about um not just about the decision but  about the trigger laws the and the real  world impact errol of what this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,6099600,6104880,is going to make uh if you are just  joining us and you don't know about this  this is a supreme court decision which
_J6A7fAwUTk,6104880,6110159,overturns roe v wade in a six to three  uh split
_J6A7fAwUTk,6110159,6115600,and we are talking about you know  overturning 50 years of precedence here  and there are a number of trigger laws
_J6A7fAwUTk,6115600,6120719,already in place across the country some  of them would go  it would be would go into place
_J6A7fAwUTk,6120719,6125840,immediately others it might take a month  or so but we're talking about  drastically changing the landscape in
_J6A7fAwUTk,6125840,6131679,this country when it comes to abortion  access  so  there's a lot more to cover here of
_J6A7fAwUTk,6131679,6136960,course we are going to be taking a  little bit of a break uh michelle  miller's going to be joining us after

_J6A7fAwUTk,6412040,6418159,[Music]  hello everyone thanks for joining us
_J6A7fAwUTk,6418159,6424719,here on cbs news i'm michelle miller and  i'm tanya rivero we start with the  breaking news out of the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,6424719,6430560,the conservative majority has overturned  roe versus wade ending the federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,6430560,6436639,protection of a woman's right to an  abortion the ruling upholds a  mississippi law that bans abortions at
_J6A7fAwUTk,6436639,6442080,15 weeks of pregnancy the opinion says  the constitution does not guarantee
_J6A7fAwUTk,6442080,6448480,abortion rights it called the 1973  president egregiously wrong and says it
_J6A7fAwUTk,6448480,6454080,is up to individual states to decide the  legality of abortion this decision will
_J6A7fAwUTk,6454080,6459199,also spark so-called trigger laws in  more than a dozen states which will also
_J6A7fAwUTk,6459199,6465840,make abortion legal there  so  joining us now first i believe is
_J6A7fAwUTk,6465840,6470880,jessica levinson she's standing by  jessica first of all what is your
_J6A7fAwUTk,6470880,6476320,reaction to this i know i know you're  not super surprised because we have the  leaked opinion  but
_J6A7fAwUTk,6476320,6481360,the reality of it  how does that leave you
_J6A7fAwUTk,6481360,6486800,so it is different to see a leaked draft  versus a final opinion honestly what's
_J6A7fAwUTk,6486800,6493679,surprising just legally is that the  language of the leaked draft is so  similar we had talked about this on air
_J6A7fAwUTk,6493679,6499360,i had predicted that the language would  be softened up but this is a very  aggressive and some would characterize
_J6A7fAwUTk,6499360,6505280,it as strident opinion where the court  doesn't just say you know there could be  a difference of opinion but here's why
_J6A7fAwUTk,6505280,6511920,we think our view is right this is as  you said roe v wade was egregiously  wrong casey versus planned parenthood
_J6A7fAwUTk,6511920,6518639,excuse me planned parenthood versus  casey 20 years later made that worse  there is no grounding in our nation's
_J6A7fAwUTk,6518639,6524800,history and tradition for the idea that  the right to obtain an abortion should  be protected under the constitution this
_J6A7fAwUTk,6524800,6532320,is extremely strong language we have  five votes on the supreme court to  overturn roe v wade six votes to uphold
_J6A7fAwUTk,6532320,6538880,that mississippi law  and what's surprising to me is that  there wasn't a fuller fleshing out of
_J6A7fAwUTk,6538880,6544719,something that we've also talked about  on air which is what does this mean for  other rights that are not written in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,6544719,6550239,constitution  part of the courts  much of the court's rationale today was
_J6A7fAwUTk,6550239,6555280,well there's no such thing as a right  written in the constitution that says
_J6A7fAwUTk,6555280,6561440,you have the right to obtain an abortion  but that's also true for same-sex  marriage that's also true for obtaining
_J6A7fAwUTk,6561440,6568560,contraception that's also true for  marrying somebody who's not of the same  race and so while justice alito in that
_J6A7fAwUTk,6568560,6574880,majority opinion  says briefly this isn't about those  other rights because we're talking about
_J6A7fAwUTk,6574880,6581440,the potential for life if you look at  the legal reasoning and then if you look  at justice thomas's concurrence where he
_J6A7fAwUTk,6581440,6587679,says and all those other rights should  go  then we do have to ask whether or not
_J6A7fAwUTk,6587679,6593760,all of those other things which we have  found to be fundamental rights in our  country whether or not they're now in
_J6A7fAwUTk,6593760,6599920,question today which is troubling to a  number of people  where does this leave us in terms of all
_J6A7fAwUTk,6599920,6607280,these other situations that are probably  coming down the pike  to the supreme court for a decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,6607280,6613119,thank you jessica we're going to head  now to cbs news chief washington  correspondent major garrett who is live
_J6A7fAwUTk,6613119,6618880,at the supreme court thanks for joining  us major  what's the reaction outside the court or
_J6A7fAwUTk,6618880,6624880,what was it when the decision came down  so this is evolving i want to make sure
_J6A7fAwUTk,6624880,6631040,you understand that so when the decision  came down 10 10 eastern the crowd that  you see a raid around me was much
_J6A7fAwUTk,6631040,6636639,smaller equally divided i'd say between  those who oppose abortion rights and  those who support it those who oppose
_J6A7fAwUTk,6636639,6643520,abortion right as soon as they read the  decision got to saw the 6-3 majority let  out a roar of approval many fell to
_J6A7fAwUTk,6643520,6650719,their knees in prayer some wept those  who support abortion rights  i would say fairly issued rhetoric that
_J6A7fAwUTk,6650719,6656719,you can only describe is embittered  what has happened since then is the  crowd has gotten much larger
_J6A7fAwUTk,6656719,6661840,and it is peaceful i'm coming to you  from first street  right in front of the supreme court my
_J6A7fAwUTk,6661840,6668159,photographer tony furlow is showing you  the supreme court and showing you how it  is essentially and effectively
_J6A7fAwUTk,6668159,6673920,a fortress  eight foot fence then surrounded by a  bike rack fence to suppres to protect
_J6A7fAwUTk,6673920,6680159,the supreme court from the opinion it  has just rendered and what's interesting  about the crowd that is gathering here
_J6A7fAwUTk,6680159,6685599,is if you read the supreme court's  opinion what the supreme court is  essentially saying is go away don't come
_J6A7fAwUTk,6685599,6691520,to the supreme court the supreme court  is not going to deal with this issue  anymore it is indifferent to this debate
_J6A7fAwUTk,6691520,6698480,it wants this debate to radiate to the  states the supreme court has said today  don't come here anymore don't petition
_J6A7fAwUTk,6698480,6704239,this body because there is no  constitutional right to an abortion so  go leave
_J6A7fAwUTk,6704239,6711199,we are indifferent to this protest which  i guarantee you is growing in size  minute by minute outside the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,6711199,6717119,court so americans as they are absorbing  this opinion are missing that signal
_J6A7fAwUTk,6717119,6722400,from the supreme court and they're going  to get here in larger and larger numbers  i predict because that has been the flow
_J6A7fAwUTk,6722400,6728719,of events over the last hour and a half  so major you know that's sort of a  natural uh outpouring of american
_J6A7fAwUTk,6728719,6735520,sentiment on both sides but let's follow  this to the next uh sort of logical step  now that the supreme court has punted
_J6A7fAwUTk,6735520,6741679,this to the states correct um how do you  anticipate that this will affect state
_J6A7fAwUTk,6741679,6748080,and local politics because now you have  an issue that is of utmost importance to  many voters
_J6A7fAwUTk,6748080,6756480,that could affect that could very  seriously affect how many people vote  red or blue from here on forward
_J6A7fAwUTk,6756639,6763040,so that is something that i guarantee  you i cannot predict but what i can tell  you is this the way this debate has
_J6A7fAwUTk,6763040,6768639,flowed and i've covered it since i  arrived in washington in 1990 is that  those who oppose abortion rights have
_J6A7fAwUTk,6768639,6774800,had a persistent campaign marching here  every year in the march for life  electing republicans
_J6A7fAwUTk,6774800,6780960,seeking republican presidents to put  those on the court who they believe  would someday overturn roe versus wade
_J6A7fAwUTk,6780960,6788880,they've now achieved that long sought  almost 50-year campaign to in their  minds reorient the court's
_J6A7fAwUTk,6788880,6795119,approach to this underlying  constitutional question they are the  prevailing side and those who have been
_J6A7fAwUTk,6795119,6801840,supportive of abortion rights never  really thought politically or judicially  this day would actually come and those
_J6A7fAwUTk,6801840,6808560,who've been most alarmed by it have been  saying for the better part of a year and  a half if not two years hey this is  coming be prepared this day is coming
_J6A7fAwUTk,6808560,6815440,it's going to be overturned and now that  it has how that is absorbed  how that is essentially debated in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,6815440,6821679,american political system will flip  because those who assume the right  established in roe v wade would always
_J6A7fAwUTk,6821679,6826719,exist now know it isn't and their  political forcefulness will change as a
_J6A7fAwUTk,6826719,6832239,result of that and those  on the  those who opposed abortion rights who've
_J6A7fAwUTk,6832239,6838560,now campaigned for this have now won and  they're like well okay we don't have  anything to fight for anymore will they
_J6A7fAwUTk,6838560,6843599,become less intense on this issue hard  to say but the politics of it now that
_J6A7fAwUTk,6843599,6849920,the court has changed what was once an  assumed constitutional right into one  that no longer exists one that has been
_J6A7fAwUTk,6849920,6857040,judicially nullified the politics will  therefore change in unexpected and  unpredictable ways yeah
_J6A7fAwUTk,6857040,6863040,i think we call that the long game the  interesting uh point that you make is  whether or not the other side the uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,6863040,6868480,abortion rights activists will go  and move forward and strategically look
_J6A7fAwUTk,6868480,6874639,at this the way uh anti-abortionism you  have to think about the numbers right  how many people say they support
_J6A7fAwUTk,6874639,6880560,abortion rights versus how many people  don't support abortion rights and i  think when you look at the numbers if
_J6A7fAwUTk,6880560,6886159,you're a political analyst uh you might  be a little bit  concerned about this issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,6886159,6891199,might be one that will give you pause  well the the that's a really that's a  really important point you made and
_J6A7fAwUTk,6891199,6896400,what's what's most relevant about the  polling data is that yes in aggregate
_J6A7fAwUTk,6896400,6901840,those numbers appear to show the  majority of the country supports  abortion rights but as a practical
_J6A7fAwUTk,6901840,6908080,matter voting jurisdiction by  jurisdiction state by state those who  are most impassioned and have been most
_J6A7fAwUTk,6908080,6913760,impassioned about this issue i guarantee  you because i've met them for 30 years  in covering american politics those who
_J6A7fAwUTk,6913760,6920400,have opposed abortion rights are much  more focused on that many of them  self-describe themselves as single-issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,6920400,6927440,voters and that strategic approach this  issue is one of the reasons today has  come to the fore and those who support
_J6A7fAwUTk,6927440,6932719,abortion rights are going to have to  look at different tactics different  rhetoric and how to say yes these are
_J6A7fAwUTk,6932719,6937920,broad aggregate numbers but how do you  translate that at the state and local  level because that's now where this
_J6A7fAwUTk,6937920,6943280,debate heads and what is the next big  issue for them  that is right it's gonna be so
_J6A7fAwUTk,6943280,6948800,interesting to see how this translates  into grassroots you know political  campaigning so let's bring in cbs news
_J6A7fAwUTk,6948800,6955679,chief white house correspondent nancy  cordes now nancy we know that president  biden is planning to address this ruling
_J6A7fAwUTk,6955679,6961679,shortly any idea of what we're expecting  him to say we do have an idea but not
_J6A7fAwUTk,6961679,6967599,because it's been signposted by the  white house tanya or by other  administration officials because we've
_J6A7fAwUTk,6967599,6974239,actually seen and heard remarkable  silence from across the administration  this morning no one including the vice
_J6A7fAwUTk,6974239,6980960,president wanting to get ahead of what  the president has to say in about half  an hour or so but the reason we have an
_J6A7fAwUTk,6980960,6987760,idea of what he's going to say is  because we've heard from democrat after  democrat on capitol hill and the
_J6A7fAwUTk,6987760,6994239,messaging is remarkably similar they are  calling this a dark day in american  history they are arguing that the
_J6A7fAwUTk,6994239,6999920,supreme court has ripped freedoms away  from american women and they are blaming
_J6A7fAwUTk,6999920,7007040,interestingly not just the supreme court  but also republican lawmakers who have  sought for decades to
_J6A7fAwUTk,7007040,7013040,instill  far right leaning judges on the federal  courts and i want to call your attention
_J6A7fAwUTk,7013040,7019679,to something speaker pelosi said a  little earlier today because i really  think that this is going to be the nut
_J6A7fAwUTk,7019679,7025199,of the midterm election message you are  now going to hear from democrats across
_J6A7fAwUTk,7025199,7030239,the spectrum and from the president of  the united states it's a very simple  message she says the republicans are
_J6A7fAwUTk,7030239,7035520,plotting a nationwide abortion ban they  cannot be allowed to have a majority in
_J6A7fAwUTk,7035520,7043040,the congress to do that  this is something you are going to hear  from democrats over and over again and
_J6A7fAwUTk,7043040,7049119,it is a very concise and simple message  it's a lot easier to convey to voters
_J6A7fAwUTk,7049119,7055280,the stakes of this election than you  know what they had to work with before  today before today they had been making
_J6A7fAwUTk,7055280,7060719,more of an economic case yes  inflation is high but we're doing
_J6A7fAwUTk,7060719,7066960,everything we can to address it and it  isn't really our fault and by the way  take a look at these jobs numbers
_J6A7fAwUTk,7066960,7072800,look at how many people have gotten jobs  in the past couple of years that is a  difficult message to break through with
_J6A7fAwUTk,7072800,7078400,this message is pretty clear if you  allow republicans to get a majority in
_J6A7fAwUTk,7078400,7083760,uh in november you will be paving the  way for a nationwide abortion ban that's
_J6A7fAwUTk,7083760,7090159,what you're gonna hear most likely from  the president today nancy does the  president have any options at this point
_J6A7fAwUTk,7090159,7097119,to protect abortion access the federal  level  he does and there are abortion rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,7097119,7103599,activists who have been pushing him to  take executive action for some time now  and he has said that he's going to do it
_J6A7fAwUTk,7103599,7109440,we don't know which of these options  he's going to choose  but there are all kinds of ideas on the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7109440,7114960,table  he is being pushed for example to  have the fda drop some of its
_J6A7fAwUTk,7114960,7121440,restrictions on the sale of abortion  pills across the country right now
_J6A7fAwUTk,7121440,7126800,many  pharmacies need to have a special  license in order to issue those pills
_J6A7fAwUTk,7126800,7132000,abortion rights activists would like to  see those dropped  there's also this idea that you could
_J6A7fAwUTk,7132000,7138480,issue travel vouchers for women in  states where abortion is suddenly banned  to make it easier for them to travel in
_J6A7fAwUTk,7138480,7143840,some cases a thousand miles to a state  that does allow abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,7143840,7149199,there's a question of whether you could  make abortions available on federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,7149199,7156960,lands within states that that ban  abortions there's a question of whether  um the military could give
_J6A7fAwUTk,7156960,7164159,service women who need an abortion who  wanted abortion  time off to basically go to a state that
_J6A7fAwUTk,7164159,7170480,allows abortions if the state that they  are stationed in doesn't so there's a  whole menu of options but the white
_J6A7fAwUTk,7170480,7176960,house has  has really been silent we've asked them  multiple times but they've really been  silent on what it is exactly that the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7176960,7182159,president will choose to do because they  were waiting to see what this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,7182159,7188000,looked like and so it's possible we'll  start to get some of those answers when  the president speaks within the next
_J6A7fAwUTk,7188000,7195280,half an hour or so nancy cordes at the  white house thank you so much i want to  bring in rebecca royfee and jessica  levinson now who are our legal analysts
_J6A7fAwUTk,7195280,7200800,i just do want to point out  rebecca that attorney general garland
_J6A7fAwUTk,7200800,7207520,just made a statement  moments ago saying that the department  of justice will protect reproductive
_J6A7fAwUTk,7207520,7215119,freedom  what does the attorney general mean by  that i i i mean i assume that all that
_J6A7fAwUTk,7215119,7222239,he can do i mean this is now a statewide  issue is protect you know certain  crossing of the border um you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,7222239,7228400,situations because it would have to have  federal jurisdiction in order for the  department of justice to be able to um
_J6A7fAwUTk,7228400,7233760,swoop in and do anything in that regard  right all right well
_J6A7fAwUTk,7234080,7240560,it's interesting that the the  administration is starting to speak on  this um  yes it is and jessica let's talk about
_J6A7fAwUTk,7240560,7246320,the text of the opinion by justice leto  what's the main reasoning behind that as
_J6A7fAwUTk,7246320,7252960,well as what chief justice roberts said  in his concurring opinion
_J6A7fAwUTk,7253199,7258480,it and if i could pick up on what  rebecca was just talking about she's  exactly right the department of justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,7258480,7264560,needs some sort of federal jurisdiction  so part of what i think attorney general  merrick garland is talking about here is
_J6A7fAwUTk,7264560,7270239,whether or not again we're going to see  movement by  the fda who has said you can have
_J6A7fAwUTk,7270239,7277280,abortion pills without an in-person  appointment we're going to see i think  states saying we're banning abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,7277280,7284639,pills and then the federal government  may have to step in and say actually  this is a federal program any state law
_J6A7fAwUTk,7284639,7290400,that presents an obstacle is preempted  by the supremacy clause  absolutely as rebecca said we're going
_J6A7fAwUTk,7290400,7296800,to see the federal government involved  in states that try and ban travel from  for instance missouri to a neighboring
_J6A7fAwUTk,7296800,7303440,state to try and obtain an abortion  we're also potentially i think going to  see the department of justice have to
_J6A7fAwUTk,7303440,7310400,defend if president biden does decide to  go forward with an executive order maybe  saying that we're providing more funds
_J6A7fAwUTk,7310400,7317119,to states  to  provide excuse me for states to provide  people to travel
_J6A7fAwUTk,7317119,7325679,then that could potentially violate the  hyde amendment which says no federal  funding goes to funding abortions and
_J6A7fAwUTk,7325679,7331440,then we have again the department of  justice having to step in and defend the  federal government so i think all of
_J6A7fAwUTk,7331440,7338239,those things are on the table you you  asked me about the main reasoning behind  the majority opinion here it really is
_J6A7fAwUTk,7338239,7345119,that there's nothing in the constitution  that says the right to privacy or the  right to an abortion and so what do we
_J6A7fAwUTk,7345119,7351440,have to do we have to then look to  history we have to look to tradition we  have to look to precedent and what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7351440,7356880,majority here said is i don't see it i  don't see it under the text of the  constitution i don't see it under
_J6A7fAwUTk,7356880,7362080,history i don't see it under precedent  that basically roe just created out of
_J6A7fAwUTk,7362080,7368880,thin cloth this idea that there's the  right to obtain an abortion casey added  to the problems of roe made that even
_J6A7fAwUTk,7368880,7375760,worse we've just exacerbated this you  know piling on problem  on top of piling on problem the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7375760,7382880,concurrence is here really interesting i  would again point people to justice  thomas's concurrence where he says
_J6A7fAwUTk,7382880,7388719,everything basically everything that's  not written in the constitution should  be on the table for being in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7388719,7396320,chopping block and then remarkably we  have the chief justice chief justice  john roberts on his own not getting
_J6A7fAwUTk,7396320,7404000,anybody really to join this view that  let's just uphold mississippi's law but  not let's not strike down row and casey
_J6A7fAwUTk,7404000,7410960,this is no longer the roberts court you  don't need him after justice amy coney  barrett gets on the court you have five
_J6A7fAwUTk,7410960,7416960,votes without him and we saw that today  i i just on this point of travel i know
_J6A7fAwUTk,7416960,7424080,so many americans are probably  scratching their heads because freedom  of movement is something that americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,7424080,7429280,believe in they can move from state to  state so this idea that you can restrict
_J6A7fAwUTk,7429280,7435199,a person a woman from entering another  state for whatever reason just it just
_J6A7fAwUTk,7435199,7440960,does not seem uh but can you plausible  that's not legal right i mean a person
_J6A7fAwUTk,7440960,7446880,cannot be prosecuted for  changing going to another state doing  something that's legal in that state
_J6A7fAwUTk,7446880,7452480,even if they're a citizen of another  state correct  well yes i mean that is i'm sorry
_J6A7fAwUTk,7452480,7457599,i mean  unless there are you know implications  for that first state so it's not as
_J6A7fAwUTk,7457599,7462800,simple as just you know you have a  certain state a certain state has a set  of laws and you you know and a different
_J6A7fAwUTk,7462800,7469599,city has a different set of laws you  could argue that some laws in some  states affect  the citizens of another state and so
_J6A7fAwUTk,7469599,7475119,therefore maybe there's some wiggle room  i mean to me it seems similar that you  know i agree with you that those laws
_J6A7fAwUTk,7475119,7480800,are problematic and that the federal  government if it has the will remember i  mean we're in the jury we're in an
_J6A7fAwUTk,7480800,7487760,administration that has the will to  protect this but if an administration a  new administration comes along that  doesn't you know i i can't imagine that
_J6A7fAwUTk,7487760,7493520,there would be much you know  enforcement i mean remember you know i  mean not to bring back a very old
_J6A7fAwUTk,7493520,7499920,historical precedent you know the  slavery and then you know sleep catcher  laws and so forth i mean this was
_J6A7fAwUTk,7499920,7505960,litigated and this these are there are  plenty of constitutional decisions
_J6A7fAwUTk,7508400,7514880,with what justice thomas is is sort of  like laying out on the table  i i would i could just click off a
_J6A7fAwUTk,7514880,7522800,number of issues that affect so many  americans right now who have been  enjoying these freedoms um
_J6A7fAwUTk,7523840,7530079,but himself right because i mean of  course loving um protected the right to  for to intermarriage and he and
_J6A7fAwUTk,7530079,7536480,affirmative action justice to thomas  also um enjoyed that that  to a great extent affirmative action at
_J6A7fAwUTk,7536480,7542239,least is arguably more there is some  language in the constitution that is  arguably more addressed is it but of
_J6A7fAwUTk,7542239,7548480,course sure and he himself is not in  favor of those laws as we know but i you  know i think that we should pause and
_J6A7fAwUTk,7548480,7554639,say you know he was alone in writing  that opinion and he no not a single  conservative justice signed on and i
_J6A7fAwUTk,7554639,7562159,personally think  that  there  will be  um you know that those those law those
_J6A7fAwUTk,7562159,7567920,opinions on  um contraception on gay marriage are
_J6A7fAwUTk,7567920,7574800,not subject to  being overturned due to this decision  and it's because not because there isn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,7574800,7579840,language in it that one might use but  rather because there's not the will and  i think you can see that in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7579840,7586480,breakdown of the opinion there's not the  will  and so you know when i see this the  dissent really saying look your
_J6A7fAwUTk,7586480,7592960,reasoning would cover all of these  decisions it's in fact a kind of  it's a counter punch because what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7592960,7598560,dissent is saying is how can you  reasonably distinguish these two things  right i know you want to reasonably
_J6A7fAwUTk,7598560,7606320,distinguish and if you can't it throws  into question the very premise that your  decision is mandated by the constitution
_J6A7fAwUTk,7606320,7612079,which is the only ground on which the  majority rests all right rebecca royfi  and jessica levinson thank you so much
_J6A7fAwUTk,7612079,7619599,please stand by we're going to take a  quick break but our breaking news  coverage of the supreme court decision  to overturn roe v wade will continue

_J6A7fAwUTk,7820239,7825520,yesterday to say the states  cannot make laws governing
_J6A7fAwUTk,7825520,7830639,the constitutional right to bear arms  and today
_J6A7fAwUTk,7830639,7836480,they're saying the exact reverse  that the states  can overturn
_J6A7fAwUTk,7836480,7844400,a constitutional right for 50 years a  constitutional right  for a woman having the right to choose
_J6A7fAwUTk,7844400,7849440,the hypocrisy is raging  but the harm
_J6A7fAwUTk,7849440,7856719,is endless  what this means to women is such an  insult  it's a slap in the face to women about
_J6A7fAwUTk,7856719,7862639,using their own judgment  to make their own decisions
_J6A7fAwUTk,7862639,7869520,about their reproductive freedom  and that was speaker nancy pelosi's  reaction to today's historic ruling from
_J6A7fAwUTk,7869520,7877040,the supreme court the conservative  majority has overturned the landmark roe  versus wade ruling which had established
_J6A7fAwUTk,7877040,7882159,the right to an abortion in america in a  6-3 ruling the court's conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,7882159,7889360,justices said roe was wrong from the  beginning and access to abortion should  be handled at the state level with the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7889360,7895280,decision 26 states will or are likely to  restrict abortion access some even have
_J6A7fAwUTk,7895280,7901199,trigger laws which ban abortions  immediately upon the court's decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,7901199,7908320,cbs news political contributor sean  sullivan joins us now he's also the  deputy politics editor for campaigns at
_J6A7fAwUTk,7908320,7913679,the washington post i wanted to pick up  on what uh speaker pelosi said and that
_J6A7fAwUTk,7913679,7920800,statement she put out she says quote the  rights of women and all americans are on  the ballot this november
_J6A7fAwUTk,7920800,7926079,so is abortion going to be  democrats new central focus for the
_J6A7fAwUTk,7926079,7931119,midterms  well it seems pretty clear from the  statements that we have seen at least in
_J6A7fAwUTk,7931119,7938000,the early going so far today that that  is something that democrats  do want to run on they see this as an
_J6A7fAwUTk,7938000,7945520,issue that can energize not only their  base but an issue that they could use to  appeal to moderate voters to voters in
_J6A7fAwUTk,7945520,7951679,swing areas  to women to men  to voters across the board and even
_J6A7fAwUTk,7951679,7958880,before  this decision came down today we have  seen democrats talk about this a lot  more than republicans have talked about
_J6A7fAwUTk,7958880,7964560,at least in a political context at least  in a campaign context and so the early  indications at least from what we're
_J6A7fAwUTk,7964560,7971679,hearing today from speaker pelosi from  candidates uh democratic candidates for  senate for house for other races um it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,7971679,7979280,very clear down the early going that  they are uh looking to use this as a  sharp point of contrast in these midterm
_J6A7fAwUTk,7979280,7984400,elections and i think we're seeing this  virtually across the board right now and  you brought up republicans sean so how
_J6A7fAwUTk,7984400,7989840,are republicans reacting to this  decision politically because as we know  from polling the majority of americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,7989840,7996239,still support a woman's right to get an  abortion and we know even in not too you  know distant history even a lot of
_J6A7fAwUTk,7996239,8003360,republicans said that they supported  this right this hasn't always been a  blanket republican position so how are
_J6A7fAwUTk,8003360,8008880,they reacting to this decision  politically are they a little worried  about uh you know down ballot contests
_J6A7fAwUTk,8008880,8014960,considering that now this fight is  essentially being moved to those down  ballot uh contests
_J6A7fAwUTk,8014960,8021119,right and this now becomes a state by  state issue i think there has been for  some time now concern among republicans
_J6A7fAwUTk,8021119,8027040,about what the political fallout could  be uh in these midterm elections from  senate races to house races to to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8027040,8032480,state-level races as for the republican  response today we have seen some  republicans praise this decision i would
_J6A7fAwUTk,8032480,8038719,point to mitch mcconnell the minority  leader who you know every time he speaks  uh he chooses his words carefully and
_J6A7fAwUTk,8038719,8044239,you often see him try to set a tone not  just for senate republicans but for  republicans who are running for the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8044239,8050400,senate he called this uh you know a  historic victory but the question now is  how much do republicans want to talk
_J6A7fAwUTk,8050400,8058400,about this their midterm blueprint has  been centered very very heavily in  inflation in rising uh gas prices in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8058400,8065679,rise in violent crime that we've seen  they are really really trying to run on  those issues and on top of that tap into
_J6A7fAwUTk,8065679,8071119,president biden's unpopularity and a  feeling that we're seeing across the  country among many americans and his
_J6A7fAwUTk,8071119,8076719,feelings reflected in polls and focus  groups and and elsewhere that they're  just not happy with democratic
_J6A7fAwUTk,8076719,8082079,leadership right now democratic control  of the white house democratic control of  congress and so i think the fear that
_J6A7fAwUTk,8082079,8089199,some republicans have and have expressed  in in recent months is that  does a decision like this then change
_J6A7fAwUTk,8089199,8095920,the landscape does it change the sort of  order of operations when voters walk  into the ballot booths you know this
_J6A7fAwUTk,8095920,8101920,year  what is going to be the top of mind  issue is it going to be the high price  of gas or is it going to be the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,8101920,8107280,court decision is it going to be crime  or is it going to be  the supreme court and abortion rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,8107280,8113920,more generally and so i think that some  republicans look at this and they say  okay there was a path politically  speaking at least that they felt very
_J6A7fAwUTk,8113920,8119119,very confident about walking down that  would lead in their view to winning back  the house and possibly winning back
_J6A7fAwUTk,8119119,8124960,control the senate and i think now it's  it's less certain and so it's definitely  worth watching how republicans talk
_J6A7fAwUTk,8124960,8130480,about this issue because we've seen them  before try to strike a balance try to  say look this is the right thing i agree
_J6A7fAwUTk,8130480,8137280,with this but  my state in some cases you hear  republicans say this my state has laws  on the books it's established i'm not
_J6A7fAwUTk,8137280,8142719,going to argue against that um so it'll  be really interesting to see you know  how republicans deal with this and i
_J6A7fAwUTk,8142719,8149280,think it'll be really telling about  their strategy all right sean thank you  so much we're going to bring in now  jennifer poppick she's the legislative
_J6A7fAwUTk,8149280,8155679,director for the national right to life  committee thanks for joining us jennifer  first uh we have to ask your reaction to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8155679,8161520,this ruling  oh you know this is this is a great day  for unborn children this is the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8161520,8166560,culmination of  50 years of effort you know i stand on  the shoulders of other people who came
_J6A7fAwUTk,8166560,8171760,before me and that this is just a  wonderful day for mothers for their  unborn children we're we're extremely
_J6A7fAwUTk,8171760,8178719,excited  and jennifer as you know several states  over a dozen have preemptively codified  abortion access uh you know ahead of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8178719,8185678,supreme court decision uh do you think  that those laws should now be challenged
_J6A7fAwUTk,8186079,8192319,in terms of challenge  you know what what this decision means  is that this again becomes a debate that
_J6A7fAwUTk,8192319,8198960,goes to states and so some states are  going to um you know  spring into law or enact um you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,8198960,8204478,protective laws for unborn children and  other states are going to allow abortion  on demand and i think this is you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,8204478,8210240,this is uncharted territory but we know  that this is going to be something  that's going to be as you know up to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8210240,8215678,people and their elected representatives  state by state congress will also have a  rule so we know some states will permit
_J6A7fAwUTk,8215678,8220880,abortion and others are going to protect  unborn children and you know it's going  to be a process that plays out here over
_J6A7fAwUTk,8220880,8227598,the next coming weeks and months  to that point house speaker nancy pelosi  said she believes republicans uh will
_J6A7fAwUTk,8227598,8234000,work to ban abortion access if they do  take control of the house and the senate  is this something your organization is
_J6A7fAwUTk,8234000,8239439,in favor of or should it remain up to  the voters of those individual states
_J6A7fAwUTk,8239439,8245359,oh certainly there's going to be a role  for for both i mean you know the states  are going to be the most immediate place
_J6A7fAwUTk,8245359,8250800,that these laws can take effect i think  we're far away a ways no you know no  matter the outcome of this election
_J6A7fAwUTk,8250800,8256399,where you know republicans are you know  predicted to to regain majorities and  we're you know going to work hard to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8256399,8261678,help like you know to make sure that  that's the case you know there's going  to be hurdles uh in the senate requires
_J6A7fAwUTk,8261678,8267280,60 votes to pass anything and the  democrats have put out the very radical  women's health protection act knowing
_J6A7fAwUTk,8267280,8272319,this decision was coming and did not  even achieve 50 votes on it so it's  going to be a tall order particularly in
_J6A7fAwUTk,8272319,8279359,the senate and now that your  organization has achieved this victory  jennifer are you going to work towards  you know shoring up resources in these
_J6A7fAwUTk,8279359,8285678,states for pregnant women who may be  you know who may need the help who who  would have otherwise perhaps had the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8285678,8291280,abortion are you are you going to work  on creating those resources that are so  needed the safety net the safety net
_J6A7fAwUTk,8291280,8296558,yeah  all right i couldn't agree with you more  and that's something that we've been you  know working on it hasn't gotten a great
_J6A7fAwUTk,8296558,8302960,deal of attention but certain states to  the tune of you know tens of tens of  millions of dollars uh the texas
_J6A7fAwUTk,8302960,8308719,alternatives there's um the emma act  that we're working to promote in certain  states the every mom matters act we
_J6A7fAwUTk,8308719,8313840,absolutely know it's more critical now  than ever to connect moms with the  resources they're going to need this is
_J6A7fAwUTk,8313840,8319760,going to be you know  uncharted territory and i think it's  going to be one we're going to find  loving arms uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,8319760,8324800,in in pro-lifers and care centers that  have long been around and we're going to  work to enhance those resources
_J6A7fAwUTk,8324800,8330558,certainly and jennifer part of the  criticism has been uh that the  organizations like yours have focused
_J6A7fAwUTk,8330558,8336160,their effort on on board children what  happens to them once those children are  born
_J6A7fAwUTk,8336160,8342719,what resources are are given to them  from from birth  on through their their education their
_J6A7fAwUTk,8342719,8348719,early education prenate uh uh uh  preschool care their their their food
_J6A7fAwUTk,8348719,8355439,resources um there are a number of  issues on the table because we're  dealing with a number of states that
_J6A7fAwUTk,8355439,8361760,just are already stretched from a social  standpoint  on the monies that come in mississippi
_J6A7fAwUTk,8361760,8367200,comes to mind louisiana  alabama
_J6A7fAwUTk,8367200,8372719,what other i mean you mentioned texas  i'm curious in no state specifically
_J6A7fAwUTk,8372719,8380319,what are some of the where have you made  strides there  when children are born into poverty
_J6A7fAwUTk,8380319,8387040,um  certainly what we're trying to work on  going forward now with every piece of  legislation we're going to try to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8387040,8393040,include an expansion of resources that  are available in that state for  healthcare for the sorts of things that
_J6A7fAwUTk,8393040,8399200,you're talking about we're going to look  at more options going forward and  there's also a huge array of federal  resources and i know that certain
_J6A7fAwUTk,8399200,8404479,members of congress have been extremely  interested in the republicans have been  interested in highlighting not only the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8404479,8410800,existing resources that are out there  between everything from the chip program  to wic to early childhood education
_J6A7fAwUTk,8410800,8417520,but to you know expanding some of these  resources i think you know this was the  just the this is just the beginning and
_J6A7fAwUTk,8417520,8423520,so we know that these resources are  going to need to be connected uh to the  moms into these babies um and
_J6A7fAwUTk,8423520,8428960,support them as they grow so you know  it's it's gonna be a priority for us  going forward and it has been and i
_J6A7fAwUTk,8428960,8434880,think there's a huge interest in making  it a strong priority there's a new  effort to concentrate on that right
_J6A7fAwUTk,8434880,8440560,absolutely jennifer poppeck we thank you  so much for joining us and giving us  your perspective as well thank you well

_J6A7fAwUTk,8610319,8616560,will make his first remarks since the  monumental decision this morning from  the supreme court that overturned roe
_J6A7fAwUTk,8616560,8621680,versus wade eliminating the  constitutional right to abortion here's  the president
_J6A7fAwUTk,8621680,8627200,it's not hyperbole to suggest a very  solemn moment  today the supreme court of the united
_J6A7fAwUTk,8627200,8633120,states  expressly took away  a constitutional right from the american  people
_J6A7fAwUTk,8633120,8638840,that it already recognized  they didn't limit it they simply took it
_J6A7fAwUTk,8638840,8645280,away  that's never been done to a right so  important to so many americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,8645280,8651280,but they did it  it's a sad day for the court and for the  country
_J6A7fAwUTk,8651280,8656479,50 years ago  roe v wade  was decided and has been the law of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8656479,8661680,land since then  this landmark case protected a woman's  right to choose
_J6A7fAwUTk,8661680,8667439,her right to make intensely personal  decisions with her doctor  free from the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8667439,8673200,from the interference of politics  it reaffirmed basic principles of  equality
_J6A7fAwUTk,8673200,8678479,that women have the power to control  their own destiny  and it reinforced a fundamental right of
_J6A7fAwUTk,8678479,8685280,privacy  right of each of us to choose how to  live our lives
_J6A7fAwUTk,8685280,8691520,now with rogue on  let's be very clear  the health and life of women in this
_J6A7fAwUTk,8691520,8696880,nation  are now at risk  as chairman and ranking member of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8696880,8702319,senate judiciary committee  as vice president now as president  united states
_J6A7fAwUTk,8702319,8709600,i've studied this case carefully  i've overseen more supreme court  confirmations than anyone today
_J6A7fAwUTk,8709600,8715760,where this case was always discussed  i believe roe v wade was the correct
_J6A7fAwUTk,8715760,8721120,decision  as a matter of constitutional law and  application of the fundamental right
_J6A7fAwUTk,8721120,8726640,to privacy and liberty and matters of  family and personal autonomy
_J6A7fAwUTk,8726640,8732080,it was a decision  on a complex matter  that drew a careful balance between a
_J6A7fAwUTk,8732080,8738720,woman's right to choose  earlier in her pregnancy and the state's  ability to regulate later in her
_J6A7fAwUTk,8738720,8745600,pregnancy  a decision with broad national consensus  that most americans of faith
_J6A7fAwUTk,8745600,8752399,and backgrounds found acceptable  that have been the law of the land for  most of the lifetime
_J6A7fAwUTk,8752399,8757840,of americans today  and it was a constitutional principle  upheld
_J6A7fAwUTk,8757840,8764080,by justices appointed by democrat  and republican presidents alike
_J6A7fAwUTk,8764080,8772160,roe v wade was a 7-2 decision  written by a justice appointed by  republican president richard nixon
_J6A7fAwUTk,8772160,8778399,in the five decades that followed roe v  wade justice is appointed by republican  presidents from eisenhower
_J6A7fAwUTk,8778399,8784800,nixon and reagan  george w bush  were among the justices who voted to
_J6A7fAwUTk,8784800,8792319,uphold the principles set forth in roe v  wade  it was three justices named by one
_J6A7fAwUTk,8792319,8798800,president  donald trump  we're the core of today's decision to  upend the scales of justice and
_J6A7fAwUTk,8798800,8806080,eliminate a fundamental right for women  in this country  make no mistake
_J6A7fAwUTk,8806080,8812160,this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades  to upset
_J6A7fAwUTk,8812160,8817359,the balance of our law  it's a realization of an extreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,8817359,8823200,ideology and a tragic error by the  supreme court in my view  the court has done what it has never
_J6A7fAwUTk,8823200,8829760,done before  expressly take away a constitutional  right  that is so fundamental
_J6A7fAwUTk,8829760,8835840,to so many americans that had already  been recognized  the court's decision to do so will have
_J6A7fAwUTk,8835840,8841520,real and immediate consequences  state laws banning abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,8841520,8847120,are automatically taking effect today  jeopardizing the health of millions of
_J6A7fAwUTk,8847120,8852800,women  some without exceptions  so extreme that women could be punished
_J6A7fAwUTk,8852800,8861600,for protecting her health  so extreme that women and girls were  forced to bear their rapist child
_J6A7fAwUTk,8862880,8866560,with the child the consequence
_J6A7fAwUTk,8869200,8874240,it just it just  stuns me  so extreme the doctors will be
_J6A7fAwUTk,8874240,8879840,criminalized for fulfilling their duty  to care
_J6A7fAwUTk,8879920,8885600,imagine having a young woman having to  carry the child
_J6A7fAwUTk,8885600,8891439,of incest as a consequence of incest  no option
_J6A7fAwUTk,8891439,8898399,too often the case  the poor women are going to be hit the  hardest  it's cruel
_J6A7fAwUTk,8898399,8905600,in fact the court laid out  state laws criminalizing abortion  that go back to the 1800s
_J6A7fAwUTk,8905600,8913680,as rationale  the court literally  taking america back 150 years
_J6A7fAwUTk,8913680,8920479,this is a sad day for the country in my  view  but it doesn't mean the fight's over let
_J6A7fAwUTk,8920479,8925680,me be very clear and unambiguous  the only way we can secure a woman's
_J6A7fAwUTk,8925680,8931359,right to choose  the balance that existed  is for congress to restore the
_J6A7fAwUTk,8931359,8936641,protections of roe v wade as federal  law
_J6A7fAwUTk,8936880,8942399,no executive action from the president  can do that  and if congress
_J6A7fAwUTk,8942399,8950800,as it appears  lacks the vote to vote to do that now  voters need to make their voices heard
_J6A7fAwUTk,8950800,8956399,this fall  we must elect more senators  representatives who will codify
_J6A7fAwUTk,8956399,8962640,the woman's right to choose into federal  law once again  elect more state leaders to protect this
_J6A7fAwUTk,8962640,8970080,right at the local level  we need to restore the protections of  roe  as law of the land we need to elect
_J6A7fAwUTk,8970080,8976640,officials who will do that  this fall roe is on the ballot
_J6A7fAwUTk,8976640,8982800,personal freedoms are on the ballot  the right to privacy  liberty equality
_J6A7fAwUTk,8982800,8990160,they're all on the ballot  until then  i will do all of my power to protect a
_J6A7fAwUTk,8990160,8995760,woman's right in states  where they will face the consequences of  today's decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,8995760,9002319,while the court's decision casts a dark  shadow over a large swath of the land  many states in this country still
_J6A7fAwUTk,9002319,9007920,recognize the woman's right to choose  so
_J6A7fAwUTk,9007920,9013120,if a woman lives in a state that  restricts abortion  the supreme court's decision does not
_J6A7fAwUTk,9013120,9018640,prevent her from traveling from her home  state to the state that allows it
_J6A7fAwUTk,9018640,9025120,does not prevent a doctor  in that state  and that state from treating her
_J6A7fAwUTk,9025120,9030160,as the attorney general has made clear  women must remain free to travel safely
_J6A7fAwUTk,9030160,9036399,to another state to seek care they need  my administration will defend that
_J6A7fAwUTk,9036399,9041680,bedrock right  if any state or local official high or  low
_J6A7fAwUTk,9041680,9048560,tries to interfere with the woman's  exercise and her basic right to travel i  will do everything in my power
_J6A7fAwUTk,9048560,9053600,to fight that deeply un-american attack  my administration will also protect a
_J6A7fAwUTk,9053600,9060000,woman's access to medications  that are approved by the food and drug  administration the fda
_J6A7fAwUTk,9060000,9065880,like contraception  which is essential for preventative  health care
_J6A7fAwUTk,9065880,9073439,mythoprestone  which the fda approved 20 years ago  to safely end early pregnancies
_J6A7fAwUTk,9073439,9078960,and is commonly used to treat  miscarriages  some states are saying that they'll try
_J6A7fAwUTk,9078960,9084240,to ban or severely restrict access to  these medications
_J6A7fAwUTk,9084240,9091520,but extremist governors and state  legislators are looking to block the  mail  or search the person's medicine cabinet
_J6A7fAwUTk,9091520,9096880,or control a woman's actions by tracking  data on her apps she uses are wrong and
_J6A7fAwUTk,9096880,9102640,extreme and out of touch  with the majority of americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,9102640,9108880,the american medical association  the american college of obstetricians  and gynecologists
_J6A7fAwUTk,9108880,9115680,wrote to me and vice president harris  stressing that these laws are not based  on are not based on evidence and asking
_J6A7fAwUTk,9115680,9121600,us to act to protect access to care they  say by limiting access to these  medicines
_J6A7fAwUTk,9121600,9127760,maternal mortality will climb in america  that's what they say
_J6A7fAwUTk,9127760,9133280,today i'm directing the department of  health and human services  to take steps
_J6A7fAwUTk,9133280,9139200,to ensure these critical medications are  available to the fullest extent possible
_J6A7fAwUTk,9139200,9144319,and the politicians cannot interfere  in the decisions that should be made
_J6A7fAwUTk,9144319,9150240,between a woman and her doctor  and my administration will remain  vigilant
_J6A7fAwUTk,9150240,9156560,as the implications of this decision  play out  i've warned about how this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,9156560,9162960,risked the broader right to privacy for  everyone  that's because roe recognized the
_J6A7fAwUTk,9162960,9168640,fundamental right to privacy  that has served as a basis for so many
_J6A7fAwUTk,9168640,9174640,more rights that have come to take we've  come to take for granted  that are ingrained in the fabric of this
_J6A7fAwUTk,9174640,9180399,country  the right to make the best decisions for  your health
_J6A7fAwUTk,9180399,9186399,the right to use birth control a married  couple in the privacy of their bedroom  for god's sake
_J6A7fAwUTk,9186399,9192800,the right to marry the person you love  justice thomas said as much today he
_J6A7fAwUTk,9192800,9198319,explicitly called  to reconsider the right of marriage  equality
_J6A7fAwUTk,9198319,9203438,the right of couples to make their  choices on contraception
_J6A7fAwUTk,9203920,9211439,this extreme and dangerous path the  court is now taking us on  let me close the two points
_J6A7fAwUTk,9211439,9217680,first  i call on everyone no matter how deeply  they care about this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,9217680,9223680,to keep all protests peaceful  peaceful peaceful peaceful no
_J6A7fAwUTk,9223680,9229600,intimidation  violence is never acceptable  threats

_J6A7fAwUTk,9235359,9240640,form  regardless of your rationale  second
_J6A7fAwUTk,9240640,9246560,i know  so many of us are frustrated and  disillusioned the court has taken
_J6A7fAwUTk,9246560,9251920,something away that's so fundamental  i know so many women are now going to

_J6A7fAwUTk,9258240,9263280,i stand with you  the consequences

_J6A7fAwUTk,9274080,9279120,and the stability of the rule of law  demand that rose should not have been
_J6A7fAwUTk,9279120,9284960,overturned  with this decision  the conservative majority of the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,9284960,9292240,court shows how extreme it is  how far removed they are from the  majority of this country
_J6A7fAwUTk,9292240,9298880,they made the united states an outlier  among developed nations in the world  but this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,9298880,9304240,must not be the final word  my administration will use all of its
_J6A7fAwUTk,9304240,9309760,appropriate lawful powers  but congress must act
_J6A7fAwUTk,9309760,9316800,and with your vote  you can act  you can have the final word
_J6A7fAwUTk,9316800,9324681,this is not over  thank you very much more to say this in  weeks to come
_J6A7fAwUTk,9327439,9332640,well there you have the president of the  united states calling this a sad day for  the court and the country pledging to do
_J6A7fAwUTk,9332640,9339520,everything in his power  to protect women's health he said now  with rogan let's be clear the health and
_J6A7fAwUTk,9339520,9346000,life of women are now at risk let's  bring in our chief white house  correspondent nancy cordes and nancy
_J6A7fAwUTk,9346000,9351439,what actions can the president take  well we only heard him give one actual
_J6A7fAwUTk,9351439,9356640,specific in that speech nora he said  he's going to be directing the  department of health and human services
_J6A7fAwUTk,9356640,9362720,to ensure that abortion pills are more  widely available particularly to women
_J6A7fAwUTk,9362720,9368240,who live in states where abortion is now  illegal what he did not say is whether
_J6A7fAwUTk,9368240,9375359,he is going to push the fda to drop  restrictions that currently limit the  number of pharmacies that can provide
_J6A7fAwUTk,9375359,9381200,those abortion pills  he didn't announce any new executive  orders doesn't mean that those won't
_J6A7fAwUTk,9381200,9386479,happen in the days to come but he didn't  lay out any specific plan right now to
_J6A7fAwUTk,9386479,9393760,do things like issue travel vouchers to  women so that if they need to go a  thousand miles to get an abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,9393760,9400560,it can be a little cheaper for them he  didn't talk about um giving service  members time off if they live in a state
_J6A7fAwUTk,9400560,9407359,that doesn't allow abortions and they  need to travel so there are going to be  a lot of questions on the minds of of
_J6A7fAwUTk,9407359,9413600,abortion rights activists about just how  far he is willing to go personally he  says he's going to do everything that he
_J6A7fAwUTk,9413600,9420000,can he called this ruling an extreme  ideology and a tragic error but we're  still waiting for some of those details
_J6A7fAwUTk,9420000,9426640,to be filled in  and nancy the the president also making  the case uh that this decision is not
_J6A7fAwUTk,9426640,9432240,the final word he said that congress  should act they could act but he also
_J6A7fAwUTk,9432240,9438800,said with your vote you can act and  laying out the case that this will be a  central issue in the upcoming midterm
_J6A7fAwUTk,9438800,9444080,elections right very explicitly laying  out a midterm election message saying
_J6A7fAwUTk,9444080,9449280,that the only way to secure women's  rights is for congress to make the right
_J6A7fAwUTk,9449280,9455520,to an abortion a federal law and he said  we don't have the votes to do that right  now democrats don't and so if people
_J6A7fAwUTk,9455520,9462160,care about that they need to vote in  november and elect pro-abortion rights  candidates at every level at the state
_J6A7fAwUTk,9462160,9468160,level and at the the national level and  that is an argument that you're already  hearing today nora not just from the
_J6A7fAwUTk,9468160,9475040,president of the united states from the  speaker of the house and virtually every  democrat that has spoken so far
_J6A7fAwUTk,9475040,9481520,nancy cordes at the white house thank  you also want to bring in jan crawford  because you heard him message
_J6A7fAwUTk,9481520,9486560,mention justice thomas clarence thomas's  singular dissent in which he said that
_J6A7fAwUTk,9486560,9493040,he wanted to reconsider marriage  equality and contraception playing out  what the furthest right or conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,9493040,9500000,opinion on the court was saying this  should go further right and justice  thomas has always been the most  conservative justice on the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,9500000,9505680,court he is the one who is willing to  completely disregard precedent on a  number of cases where other conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,9505680,9511120,justices are not and if you look at the  majority opinion which has five justices
_J6A7fAwUTk,9511120,9516479,supporting uh their view thomas was the  only one who thinks that the the other
_J6A7fAwUTk,9516479,9522560,he doesn't have the votes the other four  say no it does not we could not be more  clear these other issues are not
_J6A7fAwUTk,9522560,9528080,implicated the right to contraception  the right to same-sex marriage those are  not implicated because abortion is
_J6A7fAwUTk,9528080,9534640,different it involves a fetal life and  so there is actually an extensive  analysis kind of bulked up from that
_J6A7fAwUTk,9534640,9541520,initial draft that we saw where the  majority is saying no we don't agree  with that and thomas writes separately
_J6A7fAwUTk,9541520,9547280,but he's only writing for himself  jen crawford thank you also want to  bring in our chief washington
_J6A7fAwUTk,9547280,9553760,correspondent major garrett who is there  at the supreme court which is a fortress  with security but also a number of
_J6A7fAwUTk,9553760,9560479,protests major  so nora i've talked to protesters on  both sides of this issue this morning
_J6A7fAwUTk,9560479,9568560,since the ruling the landmark ruling was  released and they both use the same  phrase this is an earthquake and if so
_J6A7fAwUTk,9568560,9575600,this judicial earthquake has created a  fault line right here on first street in  front of the supreme court where those
_J6A7fAwUTk,9575600,9581439,interested in this opinion have come in  much larger numbers since it was handed  down at 10 10 eastern time this morning
_J6A7fAwUTk,9581439,9587120,i would say the crowd is at least three  or four times larger than it was then  some of those are curiosity seekers but
_J6A7fAwUTk,9587120,9592880,some are deeply emotionally involved in  this issue i see tears on both sides  those who've long opposed abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,9592880,9600399,rights tears of joy cheers of gratitude  those who support abortion rights bitter  tears of anguish and anger about what
_J6A7fAwUTk,9600399,9606240,the supreme court has done  one of the embedded ironies in this  large and ever growing assemblage of
_J6A7fAwUTk,9606240,9611920,americans coming this moment in front of  the supreme court if you read the  opinion today the supreme court said
_J6A7fAwUTk,9611920,9618240,don't come here anymore  the supreme court has nothing more to  say on abortion because the supreme  court no longer recognizes it as a
_J6A7fAwUTk,9618240,9623279,constitutional right worthy of  commentary go back to your states go  back to your local community well
_J6A7fAwUTk,9623279,9628960,they're not doing it here nor they're  coming in ever larger numbers  excellent point uh major garrett who's
_J6A7fAwUTk,9628960,9635760,there outside the supreme court for us  today the president also calling for  peaceful protests after the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,9635760,9642479,court has struck down roe versus wade  the president saying no intimidation  violence is never acceptable our
_J6A7fAwUTk,9642479,9647760,coverage will continue on cbs news  streaming your local news and we'll have  a full wrap-up tonight on the cbs
_J6A7fAwUTk,9647760,9653040,evening news this has been a cbs news  special report i'm nora o'donnell in  washington
_J6A7fAwUTk,9653040,9657179,[Music]
_J6A7fAwUTk,9659600,9665760,that was a cbs news special report thank  you for joining us here i'm tanya rivero  and i'm michelle miller and we continue
_J6A7fAwUTk,9665760,9674080,our breaking news of this historic  decision out of the supreme court which  has just overturned roe versus wade
_J6A7fAwUTk,9674080,9680479,the ruling ends federal protection of a  woman's right to an abortion joining us  now are cbs news legal contributors
_J6A7fAwUTk,9680479,9687040,jessica levinson and rebecca royfi  rebecca and jessica thanks to both of  you for sticking around you know so now
_J6A7fAwUTk,9687040,9692479,rebecca this decision leaves  abortions in the hands of the states now
_J6A7fAwUTk,9692479,9700800,what does that mean for states that  don't have their own abortion  protections sort of retroactively set up
_J6A7fAwUTk,9700800,9706640,so i mean in those states abortion may  become  illegal it depends on what happens
_J6A7fAwUTk,9706640,9713520,within the state legislature so it's now  up to the state legislatures and state  courts because state courts can through
_J6A7fAwUTk,9713520,9719120,their own constitutions guarantee this  right  because you can always have greater
_J6A7fAwUTk,9719120,9724800,rights provided by a constitution than  the federal constitution but if there's  nothing specifically on the state books
_J6A7fAwUTk,9724800,9729840,right now about abortion access one way  or the other that means they still have  access to abortion absolutely if it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,9729840,9735520,not if it's not  if it's not criminalized it's not a  criminal law right i wanted to point out
_J6A7fAwUTk,9735520,9742319,some of the decisions that not decisions  but some of the comments that are being  made across the board
_J6A7fAwUTk,9742319,9749760,by  senators  and former presidents i wanted to start  with uh susan collins out of maine and
_J6A7fAwUTk,9749760,9754800,and she said uh this decision is quote  inconsistent
_J6A7fAwUTk,9754800,9761760,with what justice gorsuch and kavanaugh  said in their testimony in their  meetings with me where they both were
_J6A7fAwUTk,9761760,9768319,insistent on the importance of  supporting long-standing precedent that  the country has relied upon i think
_J6A7fAwUTk,9768319,9773600,that's really interesting considering  kind of the landscape of what we're  talking about here so
_J6A7fAwUTk,9773600,9778960,how do you take this how do you read  this  uh knowing this sort of lay of the land
_J6A7fAwUTk,9778960,9784560,of what was what was about to happen and  joe manchin put out a similar statement  as well saying he felt hoodwinked
_J6A7fAwUTk,9784560,9790240,basically right  you know i mean whether that's a  politically expedient statement or
_J6A7fAwUTk,9790240,9796000,whether that's what they truly believed  i don't know but it certainly seems like  you know those of us who are paying
_J6A7fAwUTk,9796000,9802720,attention to those confirmation hearings  were certainly concerned about the  nature of those rights and especially
_J6A7fAwUTk,9802720,9809680,the right to abortion which has been a  part of a very organized movement in the  right-wing legal the the legal wing of
_J6A7fAwUTk,9809680,9815520,the right-wing um  to um to dismantle that right and so you  know it doesn't seem like much of a
_J6A7fAwUTk,9815520,9821359,surprise and  and it seems a little ingenuous to now  claim that there was you know no prior
_J6A7fAwUTk,9821359,9827760,knowledge of that disingenuous yeah yes  yes either way i can still remember  those interviews i do too and a lot of
_J6A7fAwUTk,9827760,9833680,people spent a lot of time listening  into every word and  yeah well we're going to take a short

_J6A7fAwUTk,10058800,10064960,here on cbs news i'm michelle miller and  i'm tanya rivero we start with the  breaking news out of the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,10064960,10070240,the conservative majority has overturned  roe versus wade ending the federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,10070240,10076960,protection of a woman's right to an  abortion the ruling upholds a  mississippi law that bans abortions at
_J6A7fAwUTk,10076960,10084800,15 weeks of pregnancy the opinion says  the constitution does not guarantee  abortion rights it called the 1973
_J6A7fAwUTk,10084800,10090399,president quote egregiously wrong and  says it is now up to individual states
_J6A7fAwUTk,10090399,10096880,to decide the legality of abortion now  this decision will also spark so-called
_J6A7fAwUTk,10096880,10104080,trigger laws in more than a dozen states  which will also make abortion legal  there we just heard the president
_J6A7fAwUTk,10104080,10111359,slamming the decision  it was three justices named by one
_J6A7fAwUTk,10111359,10117840,president  donald trump  were the core of today's decision to  upend the scales of justice and
_J6A7fAwUTk,10117840,10125120,eliminate a fundamental right for women  in this country  make no mistake
_J6A7fAwUTk,10125120,10131200,this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades  to upset
_J6A7fAwUTk,10131200,10137680,the balance of our law  now let's bring in cbs news chief  washington correspondent major garrett
_J6A7fAwUTk,10137680,10144560,who is live at the supreme court first  um i know it's a changing situation a  changing dynamic out there
_J6A7fAwUTk,10144560,10151760,what are you seeing now  so the president and his remarks very  near the end said all reaction to this
_J6A7fAwUTk,10151760,10158080,supreme court decision landmark as it is  should be peaceful there should be no  aggression no intimidation no violence
_J6A7fAwUTk,10158080,10163120,of any kind and i can tell you i've been  here all morning this is a peaceable
_J6A7fAwUTk,10163120,10169120,protest and assemblage there are those  who oppose abortion rights who are  delighted i would say elated because
_J6A7fAwUTk,10169120,10175840,they've told me so  about today's decision and those who  support abortion rights who are deeply  deeply embittered by this court and some
_J6A7fAwUTk,10175840,10181760,of the language i must tell you is very  strident those who oppose abortion  rights believe those who advocate for it
_J6A7fAwUTk,10181760,10188880,are essentially in their words not mine  ruthless cold-blooded murderers who have  no care or belief or support for an
_J6A7fAwUTk,10188880,10195760,unborn child those who support abortion  rights have described the supreme court  you see behind me as a christian
_J6A7fAwUTk,10195760,10202080,fascist theocracy those are the kind of  words being  spoken here in reaction to this now one
_J6A7fAwUTk,10202080,10207439,thing i also want to let you know the  crowd is growing in size i'd say it's  about two or three times larger than it
_J6A7fAwUTk,10207439,10213760,was when this opinion was handed down at  10 10 eastern this morning but again  peaceful and subdued
_J6A7fAwUTk,10213760,10219520,there's no rancor there is no fisticuffs  there's no pushing there's no shoving  and probably at least one reason for
_J6A7fAwUTk,10219520,10224800,that is the very very noticeable sizable  presence of metropolitan police u.s
_J6A7fAwUTk,10224800,10231840,capitol police and of course the court  itself is heavily protected you can see  the fences two layers of bike fence and
_J6A7fAwUTk,10231840,10238399,the big black fence in here and  positioned here since the release of  that draft majority opinion deeply
_J6A7fAwUTk,10238399,10245040,reflected in today's actual opinion from  the supreme court so the supreme court  that has decreed this new constitutional
_J6A7fAwUTk,10245040,10251920,orientation toward abortion is closed  off to the very people it's asking to  agree with yeah and i guarantee you half
_J6A7fAwUTk,10251920,10257680,of the people here do not agree it's a  pretty jarring visual to see the supreme  court behind those fences and sort of
_J6A7fAwUTk,10257680,10263120,locked away uh in these united states  but major i wanted to ask you were you  able to listen to the president's speech
_J6A7fAwUTk,10263120,10268960,moments ago and  what's your reaction and was there any  reaction from the crowd
_J6A7fAwUTk,10269279,10275520,so the crowd i don't believe was  listening to the president's remarks  there's no there was nothing evident in  reaction i didn't see a lot of people
_J6A7fAwUTk,10275520,10280640,looking into their phones trying to  catch it on any live streaming coverage  i think people who are here know what
_J6A7fAwUTk,10280640,10287680,they think about this issue those who  oppose abortion rights consider this a  day of triumph a vindication of a
_J6A7fAwUTk,10287680,10294479,essentially a victory 50 years in the  making from their perspective though not  all of them are old enough to have  fought in the trenches on that side of
_J6A7fAwUTk,10294479,10299600,the movement all that time but are  elated genuinely elated when this  decision was handed down some fell to
_J6A7fAwUTk,10299600,10306319,their knees and wept tears of joy those  who support abortion rights as i said  using that rhetoric very embittered but
_J6A7fAwUTk,10306319,10312640,they also have told me  they believe that this is now a  galvanizing moment politically for this
_J6A7fAwUTk,10312640,10318399,issue they told me you know so many  people that they have talked to who  support abortion rights generally never
_J6A7fAwUTk,10318399,10325200,thought this day would come and i've  talked to advocates here who've been  working this issue saying for the better  part of two years hey
_J6A7fAwUTk,10325200,10330720,this right is going to be taken away  this supreme court is moving in this  direction and many people they talked to
_J6A7fAwUTk,10330720,10336800,they told me said no that's never going  to happen  and now it has and they believe  fundamentally that will change
_J6A7fAwUTk,10336800,10342479,this political question from what on the  supporting abortion rights side was an  abstraction
_J6A7fAwUTk,10342479,10349120,to now a very real retrenchment in  defined rights in this country what does  privacy mean and what doesn't it mean
_J6A7fAwUTk,10349120,10355120,and they believe that will change not  only the political debate but the  political dynamic in the nation's  capital and every state capital across
_J6A7fAwUTk,10355120,10360800,the country  let's bring in thank you major i wanted  to go to cbs news chief white house
_J6A7fAwUTk,10360800,10365920,correspondent nancy cordes  who i'm sure has reaction to what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,10365920,10373920,president said but but specifically what  stood out to me was how he said this  takes us back 150 years and i was just
_J6A7fAwUTk,10373920,10379680,curious because that struck me what was  he referring to in your estimation
_J6A7fAwUTk,10379680,10386399,he was referring to the fact that even  before  roe versus wade michelle there were
_J6A7fAwUTk,10386399,10392399,states that allowed abortion and that  this was a right that was recognized at
_J6A7fAwUTk,10392399,10400319,least to some degree at the federal  level even before uh the roe versus  white uh wade case uh in the 1970s it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10400319,10407840,an interesting comment from this  particular president whose own views on  abortion abortion legislation
_J6A7fAwUTk,10407840,10413200,and even roe versus wade have really  evolved over time when he first came
_J6A7fAwUTk,10413200,10420560,into office in the 1970s president biden  said that he thought roe versus wade was  wrongly decided and that it was overly
_J6A7fAwUTk,10420560,10426160,bro broad and that as a as a roman  catholic he he believed in the the
_J6A7fAwUTk,10426160,10433120,universal right to life and um he  continued to vote  in favor of restricting abortion for uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,10433120,10440080,at least a decade after that but over  time um he he did start to move more in  the direction of most in his party uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,10440080,10446840,and the position he he came to in more  recent years is that while he himself is  personally
_J6A7fAwUTk,10446840,10451920,anti-abortion rights uh that he doesn't  believe that he should impose his faith
_J6A7fAwUTk,10451920,10457760,on anyone else or his beliefs on anyone  else and he believes in  in the right
_J6A7fAwUTk,10457760,10464640,for every woman to make her own decision  so that's where he's at right now that's  what you heard uh coming from him in his
_J6A7fAwUTk,10464640,10472399,speech today what you didn't hear coming  from him was a whole lot of specifics  about how he plans to ensure that that
_J6A7fAwUTk,10472399,10477520,right is at least partially upheld now  that this decision has come down he did
_J6A7fAwUTk,10477520,10483200,say that he was going to be directing  the department of health and human  services to ensure that abortion pills
_J6A7fAwUTk,10483200,10488720,are made more widely available but he  didn't go into any specifics about how  he plans to do that he didn't announce
_J6A7fAwUTk,10488720,10494000,any new executive orders it doesn't mean  that those executive orders won't be  forthcoming
_J6A7fAwUTk,10494000,10501359,in the coming weeks but it appears that  the white house for now decided that the  message today should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,10501359,10506640,more simple and straightforward which is  to  argue against what the supreme court has
_J6A7fAwUTk,10506640,10512319,just done and to push americans who  disagree with this decision to vote for
_J6A7fAwUTk,10512319,10517840,democrats in november if they want to  have any chance of
_J6A7fAwUTk,10517840,10523760,seeing a federal law that establishes  the universal right to an abortion in
_J6A7fAwUTk,10523760,10529200,all 50 states he did make it a  galvanizing call to voters for sure and  nancy you bring up a good point though
_J6A7fAwUTk,10529200,10534560,as you pointed out the president's own  stance on abortion has evolved somewhat  through the years you know abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,10534560,10540240,rights have not always been such a  politically polarizing issue there have  been plenty of democratic catholics
_J6A7fAwUTk,10540240,10546080,through the years who have been sort of  you know anti-abortion access and there  have been republicans through the years
_J6A7fAwUTk,10546080,10551120,who've been openly you know pro-abortion  access so how did it sort of crystallize
_J6A7fAwUTk,10551120,10557040,to where we are right now what was the  sort of  what was the historical basis for the  sort of entrenched political
_J6A7fAwUTk,10557040,10562080,polarization we're seeing now  well a big part of it was the fact that  moderate
_J6A7fAwUTk,10562080,10567359,lawmakers on both sides were voted out  of office  as their parties became more polarized
_J6A7fAwUTk,10567359,10573120,it became more difficult  to get reelected  as a democrat in a right-leaning state
_J6A7fAwUTk,10573120,10579920,became more difficult to get re-elected  as a republican in a left-leaning state  it became more difficult
_J6A7fAwUTk,10579920,10587600,as a republican for example to to get  elected if you  moved away from party orthodoxy in your
_J6A7fAwUTk,10587600,10595120,particular district you would likely get  defeated in your primary by a more  conservative candidate and so we've seen
_J6A7fAwUTk,10595120,10600800,um more and more of these moderates  disappear you know there were a handful
_J6A7fAwUTk,10600800,10607840,of of senate democrats for example who  actually voted to confirm justice  kavanaugh it wasn't just senator joe
_J6A7fAwUTk,10607840,10614319,manchin who is now  expressing disappointment in man in  kavanaugh who says he he didn't tell him
_J6A7fAwUTk,10614319,10619600,the truth but there were a couple other  moderate democratic senators who voted
_J6A7fAwUTk,10619600,10626000,for kavanaugh uh who have since been  been voted out of office because they  came from red states so you just it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10626000,10633200,just a primarily a function of of the  vanishing middle  along with the fact that
_J6A7fAwUTk,10633200,10638240,you know that this issue has really  become sort of one of the central litmus
_J6A7fAwUTk,10638240,10644160,tests for democrats and republicans  alike and that has been the case uh ever
_J6A7fAwUTk,10644160,10649680,since i started covering washington in  the 1990s  great way to put it yeah let thank you
_J6A7fAwUTk,10649680,10654880,nancy we're going to go now to our chief  legal correspondent jan crawford
_J6A7fAwUTk,10654880,10660479,jan thanks for joining us um  so  i i we can't we there's been a lot of
_J6A7fAwUTk,10660479,10668960,discussion about chief justice john  roberts and his role in this decision  and an almost uh sort of ethereal sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,10668960,10674560,of disappearance of of his role on the  court as any kind of leader as a leader
_J6A7fAwUTk,10674560,10679920,of this court so what can you tell us  about that  well the chief justice just has one vote
_J6A7fAwUTk,10679920,10687120,like the rest of them so you know he has  as the leader of the court he can kind  of make sure the trains run on time uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,10687120,10694160,but he doesn't have any more power to  vote than the rest of them do so you  know the what happened with the chief  justice he was the swing vote he was
_J6A7fAwUTk,10694160,10699200,always the one we saw him save  obamacare president obama's signature
_J6A7fAwUTk,10699200,10705840,health care legislation and by joining  with the liberals because he was kind of  the one in the middle well now with
_J6A7fAwUTk,10705840,10712880,three new justices appointed by  president trump including the last one  who replaced the late justice ruth bader
_J6A7fAwUTk,10712880,10718160,ginsburg roberts doesn't have that kind  of power to swing the vote his vote  doesn't matter as much anymore that's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10718160,10723520,why we saw today it only it takes five  votes to get to a decision and there's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10723520,10730080,five without john roberts  yeah and speaking of you know we want to  hear a little bit more from the dissent
_J6A7fAwUTk,10730080,10736160,so what more can you tell us about that  what were the points made  well the dissents were as you would  expect
_J6A7fAwUTk,10736160,10741520,you know  quite comprehensive and i think what was  notable is that they were it was a joint
_J6A7fAwUTk,10741520,10747359,descent uh where they all it was it was  the three liberal justices together um
_J6A7fAwUTk,10747359,10754560,uh it's one voice uh speaking so  powerfully about how they believe that  the court has really deprived women
_J6A7fAwUTk,10754560,10761600,of uh equality uh and equal treatment  and this would have devastating  consequences for women so i mean it was
_J6A7fAwUTk,10761600,10768399,it was uh as you would expect an  incredibly powerful dissent by those  three i i think that you know obviously
_J6A7fAwUTk,10768399,10775359,i find it incredibly ironic that the  dissenter that we think of in some of  these issues in these cases once was
_J6A7fAwUTk,10775359,10781439,justice ruth bader ginsburg who devoted  her whole entire life to working for  reproductive rights and reproductive
_J6A7fAwUTk,10781439,10788479,equality and had she  retired earlier  where say a democratic president could
_J6A7fAwUTk,10788479,10795439,have replaced her  roe versus wade would still be the law  of the land  so she was replaced by a republican
_J6A7fAwUTk,10795439,10801520,nominee nominated by president trump  because she she died while she was on  the bench so that those are the kind of
_J6A7fAwUTk,10801520,10809040,things that uh can affect the direction  and future of the supreme court and this  is likely to be the supreme court for a
_J6A7fAwUTk,10809040,10815279,long time  and so when we talk about you know  protesting at the court or what what can
_J6A7fAwUTk,10815279,10821359,people do or what should people do  you know it's over at the supreme court  now it's going to go to the states it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10821359,10828319,going to go to congress the court is  saying take it to your elected officials  that's the way it was until 1973. there
_J6A7fAwUTk,10828319,10836319,was never a federal right in the  constitution no state had ever  recognized one until the supreme court  for the first time i mean no no court
_J6A7fAwUTk,10836319,10842080,until the first time the supreme court  did in 1973 and that decision was wrong  it was wrongly decided then and it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,10842080,10847520,wrongly decided today the question is  going to be now what are people going to  do about it when you see the president
_J6A7fAwUTk,10847520,10854319,talking about  maternal mortality and maternal health  uh you know this is a moment where you
_J6A7fAwUTk,10854319,10859359,could find some consensus that people on  both sides could come together and say  we need to do something about that in
_J6A7fAwUTk,10859359,10866560,the meantime you can do all these other  things but you know where can we make  improvements for people who are really  going to be affected by this ruling who
_J6A7fAwUTk,10866560,10873040,now don't have that option of seeking  abortion in some of these red states who  may not have the funds to travel
_J6A7fAwUTk,10873040,10878319,to you know half the states that will  still allow it  you can talk about things president
_J6A7fAwUTk,10878319,10884560,biden can do he's pretty limited  even the idea of federal funds for  travel there's a federal law in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,10884560,10891520,books that prohibits federal funds for  abortion generally that's that's going  to be i think a really hard road to hoe
_J6A7fAwUTk,10891520,10898160,so  aside from where people said  answer to your questions
_J6A7fAwUTk,10898720,10904399,i mean i'm sorry  no jan you know i i sit back and as a
_J6A7fAwUTk,10904399,10911279,just kind of like looking at this as a  lay person watching what would actually  happen actually over the last two days
_J6A7fAwUTk,10911279,10918240,the lay person might look at this and  say you know wait a minute so states  have control on this one issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,10918240,10925200,and yet the federal government has  control on this other issue about the  gun case
_J6A7fAwUTk,10925439,10930800,and so when you look at sort of like the  supreme court appears to be kind of like
_J6A7fAwUTk,10930800,10939120,on  an a case-by-case  issue on a various number of of subjects
_J6A7fAwUTk,10939120,10945200,here and and you look at this concept of  starry decisis or a precedent you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,10945200,10951279,which is central to the supreme court  ruling uh but you have a situation where  the majority of justices went against
_J6A7fAwUTk,10951279,10956880,precedent so when you look at like it  seems like they're cherry-picking to the
_J6A7fAwUTk,10956880,10961920,layperson  uh a decision that isn't based on uh
_J6A7fAwUTk,10961920,10968560,what has been done before or what has  been done in the past or at least even  on the same side
_J6A7fAwUTk,10968560,10975920,of okay this is a states issue states  have rights versus like well the federal  government has uh extensive control here
_J6A7fAwUTk,10975920,10982160,so i mean right where what's going on  here i guess is my question you know i  think that the bottom line is elections
_J6A7fAwUTk,10982160,10988399,matter and republican presidents as  we've seen are going to nominate  justices who see
_J6A7fAwUTk,10988399,10994160,the constitution in a more narrow way  and so they're going to look to the  words of the constitution and they're
_J6A7fAwUTk,10994160,11000960,going to look to history and they're not  willing to say or to expand those rights  if it's not really kind of what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11000960,11008319,framers originally meant so for example  yesterday we saw the supreme court  strike down a new york law a state law
_J6A7fAwUTk,11008319,11015600,that imposed a kind of an extra hoop on  lawful gun owners if they wanted to get  a permit uh so you know they said no you
_J6A7fAwUTk,11015600,11022319,can't do that that violates the second  amendment well and then we saw today uh  the courts say like well you know the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11022319,11027600,court's not going to read anything into  the constitution states just do whatever  you want on abortion it's not in our
_J6A7fAwUTk,11027600,11033760,backyard anymore  i mean obviously that seems totally  inconsistent but if you're a  conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,11033760,11039279,legal scholar  and this is the philosophy they have you  look to the words of the constitution
_J6A7fAwUTk,11039279,11045439,and the text the history you look to  what the meaning of i mean what the the  framers meant and that's what they did
_J6A7fAwUTk,11045439,11051120,in both those cases the second amendment  is a lot different the words of that  amendment is a lot different than the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11051120,11056399,due process clause of the the 14th  amendment which just talks about a  general liberty but a lot of people
_J6A7fAwUTk,11056399,11063279,would argue there's still a lot of room  for interpretation and that second  amendment right to bear arms right  there's a lot of yeah and that is a more
_J6A7fAwUTk,11063279,11068720,liberal judicial philosophy right and  that's the the difference in how you see  these various constitutional
_J6A7fAwUTk,11068720,11074319,interpretations and again bottom line is  elections matter and so
_J6A7fAwUTk,11074319,11079359,the president gets to make these choices  and the senate gets to confirm them
_J6A7fAwUTk,11079359,11086000,right and so if you happen to be in a  moment where you have a republican  president and a republican senate you're  going to be able to put on someone who
_J6A7fAwUTk,11086000,11092000,has a conservative legal philosophy and  that's exactly what happened in the  presidency of donald trump so when you
_J6A7fAwUTk,11092000,11098560,hear people say go out to vote that's  that's uh that affects the united states  supreme court and how they interpret
_J6A7fAwUTk,11098560,11103760,rights or don't interpret rights yeah  okay rebecca you've been sticking with
_J6A7fAwUTk,11103760,11109439,us all the time which is so great and so  appreciated you know  our viewers are probably aware that
_J6A7fAwUTk,11109439,11115600,there are 13 states that have trigger  laws in place which means they're about  to go into effect either now or within
_J6A7fAwUTk,11115600,11121279,the month  which you know each law is slightly  different but they essentially
_J6A7fAwUTk,11121279,11127200,ban uh you know are pretty or pretty  complete bans so for people who live in
_J6A7fAwUTk,11127200,11133200,these states  what do they need to know  well i mean they need to know where if
_J6A7fAwUTk,11133200,11138960,they are looking to get an abortion they  will need to know where nearby abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,11138960,11145120,clinics might be whether they can travel  there where there might be some funding  for that travel um there you know the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11145120,11151279,the those laws go into effect and fairly  immediately that um access to abortion  within their state
_J6A7fAwUTk,11151279,11156640,will end right that's  there are i want to say the ones that  are immediate i'm just going to say are
_J6A7fAwUTk,11156640,11162560,kentucky louisiana and south dakota here  we have we have can we go back to that  graphic
_J6A7fAwUTk,11162560,11169520,uh it's really important we we pinpoint  this graphic that you just had up there  there there you go so the immediate ones
_J6A7fAwUTk,11169520,11176160,are louisiana kentucky and south dakota  and then within 30 days idaho tennessee
_J6A7fAwUTk,11176160,11181439,texas  arkansas mississippi missouri north
_J6A7fAwUTk,11181439,11186479,dakota oklahoma  utah wyoming
_J6A7fAwUTk,11186479,11192640,i think that's i think that's the  complete list  so what you know it's it's like and so
_J6A7fAwUTk,11192640,11200000,some of these are pretty much landlocked  yeah um that you'd have to go through  three states in order to access you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,11200000,11206560,a legal abortion but there's some there  there's even a question as to whether or  not in some cases people will be able to
_J6A7fAwUTk,11206560,11212080,travel  to  to  across state lines to get an abortion if
_J6A7fAwUTk,11212080,11218560,they so choose or decide to do that  right and i mean there's also a question  about access to information so you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,11218560,11225040,i am sure that there are groups out  there who are working already and have  in the works ways to give this
_J6A7fAwUTk,11225040,11230960,information information about the  pill that works as an abortion pill and
_J6A7fAwUTk,11230960,11236000,ways to think about travel and to get  funds but how is that information going
_J6A7fAwUTk,11236000,11242399,to be disseminated to people who need it  especially those who  do not have
_J6A7fAwUTk,11242399,11248720,means to  access that information on their own  absolutely and jan if you're still with
_J6A7fAwUTk,11248720,11254080,us can you comment on how this might  affect other 14th amendment cases
_J6A7fAwUTk,11254080,11260080,well that's been a huge question  obviously and remember we got the the  draft opinion that was leaked about two  months ago
_J6A7fAwUTk,11260080,11265359,that said and justice alito in that  draft opinion said it's not going to i
_J6A7fAwUTk,11265359,11271600,thought it was interesting that today  the court actually went into a little  more analysis on that and said that it
_J6A7fAwUTk,11271600,11277439,doesn't and i don't know  we don't know how we can be more clear  the right to contraception and a right
_J6A7fAwUTk,11277439,11283760,to same-sex marriage uh yes while  grounded in some of the same  constitutional protections as the right
_J6A7fAwUTk,11283760,11288960,to an abortion was that abortion is  different it is unique because unlike
_J6A7fAwUTk,11288960,11295200,the other issues abortion involves the  life of someone else this is how the  court put it now there was one justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,11295200,11302160,justice clarence thomas who wrote  separately just by himself saying but i  think that it does affect those other
_J6A7fAwUTk,11302160,11307840,cases but you know like we've been  discussing you know day in and day out  it takes five votes
_J6A7fAwUTk,11307840,11316160,at the supreme court and right now  justice thomas who is the most  conservative justice who is willing to  look at any president uh is the only one
_J6A7fAwUTk,11316160,11322319,that says that so janet is he signaling  that he would reverse  you know same sex saying that he thinks
_J6A7fAwUTk,11322319,11329279,that's on the table because he doesn't  think that you know the the liberty  interest found in in the due process
_J6A7fAwUTk,11329279,11334560,clause of the 14th amendment uh you know  it's kind of he thinks that's just kind  of made-up law so he's saying like yeah
_J6A7fAwUTk,11334560,11340319,that's on the table too but he's the  only one that's my point and so you're  either gonna potentially you're gonna
_J6A7fAwUTk,11340319,11345840,have to have four more justices who  agree with justice thomas  you know appointed by presidents down
_J6A7fAwUTk,11345840,11351520,the road right now the other  four  uh who agree that roe should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,11351520,11357760,overturned or emphasizing that no those  cases are not on the table because
_J6A7fAwUTk,11357760,11364319,abortion is different so justice thomas  is on an island as far as this country  and that's not unusual that's not
_J6A7fAwUTk,11364319,11369680,unusual justice thomas is  perfectly fine being out there on an  island of his own he's been like that
_J6A7fAwUTk,11369680,11376319,since he joined the court he was willing  to go his own way uh  he doesn't really care what people think
_J6A7fAwUTk,11376319,11382319,he thinks his duty is to follow the law  or this he says how you know how he  thinks the law should be interpreted so
_J6A7fAwUTk,11382319,11387600,i you know to me  it's it's a it's another concurring  opinion from justice thomas uh by
_J6A7fAwUTk,11387600,11392640,himself right now all right jan crawford  we thank you rebecca ruffy we thank you

_J6A7fAwUTk,11603439,11610080,historic ruling from the supreme court  the conservative majority has overturned  the landmark row versus wade ruling
_J6A7fAwUTk,11610080,11615760,which established the right to an  abortion here in america that's right in  a six to three ruling the court's
_J6A7fAwUTk,11615760,11622239,conservative justices said roe was wrong  from the beginning and access to  abortions should be handled at the state
_J6A7fAwUTk,11622239,11627439,level with that decision 26 states will  or are likely to restrict abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,11627439,11632960,access some even have trigger laws in  place which ban abortion immediately
_J6A7fAwUTk,11632960,11638560,upon the court's decision or within the  next 30 days  and joining us now is dr stephanie
_J6A7fAwUTk,11638560,11645040,gustin she's medical director for the  heartland center for reproductive  medicine dr gustin uh thank you for
_J6A7fAwUTk,11645040,11650560,joining us  regarding this change  in federal law what does this mean in
_J6A7fAwUTk,11650560,11656399,regards to  fertility treatments for women  yeah that's a really great question
_J6A7fAwUTk,11656399,11662399,thank you so much for having me you know  at this very moment nothing has changed  i think everyone in the public needs to
_J6A7fAwUTk,11662399,11668319,know that  i think a lot of people are pretty  worried appropriately  but i think at a state-by-state level it
_J6A7fAwUTk,11668319,11674800,really depends on the language  of the trigger bans that exist in the  language of the bills that are
_J6A7fAwUTk,11674800,11681200,up for  you know a re-vote or a re-eval and so  what we're doing as fertility
_J6A7fAwUTk,11681200,11686720,specialists  in nebraska but also nationally is  really trying to educate our
_J6A7fAwUTk,11686720,11694560,constituents so patients friends family  of people who are fertility  patients but also probably equally as
_J6A7fAwUTk,11694560,11699760,importantly is  our legislatures and our senators you  know we want
_J6A7fAwUTk,11699760,11704880,um  fertility patients who are one and eight  in the population to be supported but we
_J6A7fAwUTk,11704880,11711359,really need the other seven and eight so  all all of us at the table  working to protect fertility care
_J6A7fAwUTk,11711359,11718080,so dr gustin can we get specific if you  don't mind because we do know that you  know a lot of fertility treatments
_J6A7fAwUTk,11718080,11725040,involve creating embryos that are either  you know frozen and used later or not  used and sometimes the embryos that are
_J6A7fAwUTk,11725040,11730640,not used are destroyed um is any of this  going to be covered under this new
_J6A7fAwUTk,11730640,11738239,ruling  that's a  it's also an excellent question and it  really it really depends so previously
_J6A7fAwUTk,11738239,11743920,legislation was  brought to the table in nebraska failed  that looked at defining life at
_J6A7fAwUTk,11743920,11751600,fertilization  um and gave no protections thereafter so  you're right you know a fertilized egg
_J6A7fAwUTk,11751600,11757840,is an early embryo and if if  language and in the law states that that
_J6A7fAwUTk,11757840,11765279,is a life that has equal protection of  that of a walking breathing speaking  human being we're in trouble when we go
_J6A7fAwUTk,11765279,11770319,to  culture those embryos or thaw those  embryos
_J6A7fAwUTk,11770319,11777359,so what we're doing is really trying to  educate everyone that they're not the  same thing and to really make the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11777359,11785279,language clear  in future discussions and legislative  sessions what you know what really ibf
_J6A7fAwUTk,11785279,11791040,is and what it isn't and so at this  point nothing has changed in your  ability to help your patients is that
_J6A7fAwUTk,11791040,11797680,correct  correct and again i just think that  that's really important for everyone to  know right now everything is as it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,11797680,11804399,and we are working tirelessly we've been  working since the leaked  opinion a couple months back to really
_J6A7fAwUTk,11804399,11811840,start to lay the groundwork and educate  the public at large as well as our  senators of how important language is
_J6A7fAwUTk,11811840,11817120,right now yeah language and  definitions in particular because you
_J6A7fAwUTk,11817120,11823200,could take you know what you know this  this means all the way back to like a
_J6A7fAwUTk,11823200,11829840,woman's you know  her egg not just an embryo but but her  egg a man's sperm i mean there were
_J6A7fAwUTk,11829840,11836000,there were discussions as to you know  where does how far does it get life  begin  and i guess you're going to it's a
_J6A7fAwUTk,11836000,11842239,re-education really  well i think i think the part of the  problem is that that's a philosophical
_J6A7fAwUTk,11842239,11847920,question right that's not a scientific  question and i think that we kind of  muddy those
_J6A7fAwUTk,11847920,11853760,those sentiments together um but i think  we need to be really careful  because not everybody subscribes to the
_J6A7fAwUTk,11853760,11860880,same philosophy that's true that's right  and  for some it's it's a religious issue for  others it's not right so
_J6A7fAwUTk,11860880,11867680,there's that piece of it so you know  doctor what would you advise women there  are women out there who may be worried
_J6A7fAwUTk,11867680,11874560,about their ability to get pregnant in  the near future and they're worried  about  fertility treatment changes
_J6A7fAwUTk,11874560,11882160,there's a lot of mystery shrouding for  fertility treatment as it is right it's  something that a lot of people are not  comfortable talking about openly um so
_J6A7fAwUTk,11882160,11889680,where would you advise women to go who  need some clarity who are perhaps  worried about their own reproductive  future yeah but also don't want sort of
_J6A7fAwUTk,11889680,11895279,like to get  you know the big surprise  at the end here
_J6A7fAwUTk,11895279,11900560,okay so a few things i think that's a  great question one is you don't need a  referral to see a fertility specialist
_J6A7fAwUTk,11900560,11906319,so if anybody's concerned  they can always  make an appointment just to be educated
_J6A7fAwUTk,11906319,11911680,that's what we're here for  um the american side of reproductive  medicine is an excellent resource for
_J6A7fAwUTk,11911680,11916800,patients  as well as resolve which is another  wonderful organization
_J6A7fAwUTk,11916800,11922720,i think  people really need to spend time locally  speaking to their legislatures and
_J6A7fAwUTk,11922720,11928800,senators about their concerns because  believe it or not they are our  representatives and our opinions and
_J6A7fAwUTk,11928800,11935760,concerns matter so that's actually been  really profound here in nebraska and i  think the more people speak out about
_J6A7fAwUTk,11935760,11942720,their concerns about access or fertility  care the more and more people are  listening so  i think as patients want education
_J6A7fAwUTk,11942720,11949840,that's why we're here come see us  follow people on instagram there's a lot  of wonderful fertility doctors providing
_J6A7fAwUTk,11949840,11956880,just information about infertility  online all the time including myself  and then um you know speak out don't
_J6A7fAwUTk,11956880,11963359,don't be afraid to not  to  to share your concerns with both your  friends your neighbors your family your
_J6A7fAwUTk,11963359,11970560,colleagues but also your representatives  that's why they're there yeah dr gustin  how how do you thread that needle um as
_J6A7fAwUTk,11970560,11977120,we already said there there there is  there's such a divide  and they're they're varying opinions on
_J6A7fAwUTk,11977120,11984399,this issue  specifically with regard to fertility uh  to um you know education surrounding
_J6A7fAwUTk,11984399,11990080,fertility and and pregnancy  how do you thread that needle
_J6A7fAwUTk,11990080,11996399,yeah you know  what i do could not be more pro-family  right and i think it's really
_J6A7fAwUTk,11996399,12002000,disheartening that it's getting looped  into all of this and i think we just  have to remind
_J6A7fAwUTk,12002000,12007840,everyone that the goal of fertility  specialists is to help families who
_J6A7fAwUTk,12007840,12014160,desperately want to have children become  parents  and and we want to continue providing  that care and i think people really need
_J6A7fAwUTk,12014160,12020640,to fully understand um  what we're here to do  and to honor that request of patients
_J6A7fAwUTk,12020640,12026239,who really want to become parents right  so i think it's just  really trying to be thoughtfully
_J6A7fAwUTk,12026239,12033760,educating the the community  um to be good listeners to understand  what barriers people may have in their
_J6A7fAwUTk,12033760,12039439,understanding of what we do  and trying to speak in a way that that  people can really appreciate that it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,12039439,12045359,good to talk about it openly right it's  always it's never a good thing when  there's too much mystery surrounding  something because then people can fill
_J6A7fAwUTk,12045359,12050399,in the blanks right so it's better to be  open right  and and
_J6A7fAwUTk,12050399,12057439,talk about the treatments but  you know dr gustin thank you so much for  joining us we know that what you do is  try to help people get pregnant who you
_J6A7fAwUTk,12057439,12064000,know have trouble getting pregnant so  thank you so much um for joining us we  appreciate it  thank you for having me absolutely and
_J6A7fAwUTk,12064000,12071600,we want to take you now uh to capitol  hill where house minority leader kevin  mccarthy spoke about the ruling house
_J6A7fAwUTk,12071600,12076720,republicans are celebrating the decision  let's take a look
_J6A7fAwUTk,12076720,12083439,only a few of us are speaking today  but i hope you acknowledge everyone  who's standing behind us
_J6A7fAwUTk,12083439,12090000,i hope you acknowledge everybody who's  sitting at home  saying the exact same words
_J6A7fAwUTk,12090000,12096560,that we are  you know today's supreme court decision  in dobbs is the most important
_J6A7fAwUTk,12096560,12102080,pro-life ruling in american history  by a vote of six to three
_J6A7fAwUTk,12102080,12109040,the court affirmed  that the power to protect unborn life is  returned to the people and their elected
_J6A7fAwUTk,12109040,12117279,representatives  the people have won a victory  the right to life has been vindicated
_J6A7fAwUTk,12117279,12123600,the voiceless  will finally have a voice  this great nation can now live up to its
_J6A7fAwUTk,12123600,12132880,core principle  that all are created equal  not born equal created equal
_J6A7fAwUTk,12133120,12138160,americans celebrate this historic  victory because we know it will save the
_J6A7fAwUTk,12138160,12143439,lives of millions of children  and it will give families hope
_J6A7fAwUTk,12143439,12150160,but as encouraging as today's decision  is  our work is far from done
_J6A7fAwUTk,12150160,12156880,americans remain one of only seven  countries on earth  that allow elective abortions in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,12156880,12162080,third trimester  of those seven countries that america is  one of them
_J6A7fAwUTk,12162080,12167359,there's two others china and north korea  that is radical
_J6A7fAwUTk,12167359,12173040,the house democrats continue to support  it against the wishes of the american  people
_J6A7fAwUTk,12173040,12179760,this congress  every house democrat has voted for  extreme policies
_J6A7fAwUTk,12179760,12185840,like taxpayer-funded abortion on demand  until the point of birth
_J6A7fAwUTk,12185840,12192080,but democrats radical agenda does not  have america's support to the contrary

_J6A7fAwUTk,12291520,12296560,would put on the floor well first and  foremost i believe in saving every life  possible
_J6A7fAwUTk,12296560,12301680,look at what we have done  hide amendment but more importantly look
_J6A7fAwUTk,12301680,12309040,at what the democrats have done for  decades that was a bipartisan position  why did this new radical agenda when the
_J6A7fAwUTk,12309040,12316399,democrats took the house the senate and  the white house even the president biden  who had supported that remove that
_J6A7fAwUTk,12316399,12323120,look at anne wagner's bill  and when you look at where we can do we  will continue to look wherever we can go
_J6A7fAwUTk,12323120,12329279,to save as many lives  you touched on this a little bit but
_J6A7fAwUTk,12329279,12334560,current laws are still in place right  now where the attorney general is just  not doing anything about it in plain
_J6A7fAwUTk,12334560,12340960,politics what would you want to tell him  specifically  i would tell him in less than 140 days

_J6A7fAwUTk,12372239,12377279,minority leader kevin mccarthy  discussing the supreme court's decision  praising today's ruling that has
_J6A7fAwUTk,12377279,12383520,overturned roe versus wade eliminating  federal protections for a woman to have  an abortion he calls the decision a
_J6A7fAwUTk,12383520,12389600,victory but says the republicans work is  not done we have breaking news
_J6A7fAwUTk,12389600,12397040,right now though we we must go now to  congress they have passed a landmark  bipartisan gun bill it's now headed to
_J6A7fAwUTk,12397040,12403521,the president biden's desk and that is  where he is expected to sign it into law
_J6A7fAwUTk,12403600,12409120,the legislation includes expanded  background checks for gun buyers under  the age of 21 as well as funding for
_J6A7fAwUTk,12409120,12414399,states to enact red flag laws and boost  mental health services it also closes
_J6A7fAwUTk,12414399,12421920,the so-called boyfriend loophole to  prevent domestic violence abusers from  buying a gun let's listen every single
_J6A7fAwUTk,12421920,12427439,one of us in danger  and what i think many of our colleagues
_J6A7fAwUTk,12427439,12433840,perhaps haven't quite or perhaps they  have  fully understood is that this also
_J6A7fAwUTk,12433840,12439920,undermines the right to privacy in the  united states of america
_J6A7fAwUTk,12441439,12449120,but we are here to solve this issue  our job is to develop a path forward
_J6A7fAwUTk,12449120,12454399,and in that  we know that this house has passed
_J6A7fAwUTk,12454399,12460319,and is willing to codify roe  but what we also need is answers from
_J6A7fAwUTk,12460319,12466560,our colleagues in the united states  senate  so to those senators
_J6A7fAwUTk,12466560,12473520,who voted  for these justices  under the claim and the guys that this
_J6A7fAwUTk,12473520,12480800,would not happen this decision falls on  them  what will they do
_J6A7fAwUTk,12481840,12490120,as they were lied to  what will they do  as a consequence of this decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,12491359,12496720,whether that be  republican or democrat
_J6A7fAwUTk,12496720,12502800,but we cannot allow  this to go on unanswered
_J6A7fAwUTk,12502800,12508720,we are talking about a court  of with the majority of justices
_J6A7fAwUTk,12508720,12514319,appointed by a party that has not won a  popular presidential election
_J6A7fAwUTk,12514319,12523279,more than once in 30 years  ruling against the majority of americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,12523279,12530960,we have a senate  that is controlled by minority rule
_J6A7fAwUTk,12531120,12537600,and we have a house suffering from the  impacts of gerrymandering that amplifies
_J6A7fAwUTk,12537600,12544319,and undermines our democracy  we are in a very dangerous moment not
_J6A7fAwUTk,12544319,12550960,just for women  not just for lgbt communities  not just for
_J6A7fAwUTk,12550960,12556080,all of us but we are in a dangerous  moment in the world  because this is not just about the right
_J6A7fAwUTk,12556080,12562160,to choice  this is about rule of law  and democracy
_J6A7fAwUTk,12562160,12567279,and who is a full person  in the eyes of the law
_J6A7fAwUTk,12567279,12574880,but to all of those  who are watching today's events unfold

_J6A7fAwUTk,12580319,12587601,in depression  in anxiety  one thing remains steady
_J6A7fAwUTk,12587760,12594239,that we  will not stop fighting until  this is fixed
_J6A7fAwUTk,12594239,12600840,and i say that to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle we are not going
_J6A7fAwUTk,12600840,12607040,away  we stay  we fight
_J6A7fAwUTk,12607040,12614680,we push  and we will not be silenced

_J6A7fAwUTk,12634160,12639760,about the fact that you know this isn't  just about abortion rights it's about a
_J6A7fAwUTk,12639760,12646239,much larger precedent here and who is a  full person in the eyes of law oh she
_J6A7fAwUTk,12646239,12652640,also made the point that this is uh you  know from her perspective about minority  rule  getting the last word
_J6A7fAwUTk,12652640,12660720,right when you talk about  the representative government that we  have and there seems to be two very  distinctive differences of opinion
_J6A7fAwUTk,12660720,12665760,over how the united states as a whole  has been pulled as to how they feel
_J6A7fAwUTk,12665760,12671680,about abortion rights versus  you know access

_J6A7fAwUTk,12887600,12892960,yesterday to say the states  cannot make laws governing
_J6A7fAwUTk,12892960,12898000,the constitutional right to bear arms  and today
_J6A7fAwUTk,12898000,12903920,they're saying the exact reverse  that the states  can overturn
_J6A7fAwUTk,12903920,12911840,a constitutional right for 50 years a  constitutional right  for a woman having the right to choose
_J6A7fAwUTk,12911840,12916880,the hypocrisy is raging  but the harm
_J6A7fAwUTk,12916880,12924080,is endless  what this means to women is such an  insult  it's a slap in the face to women about
_J6A7fAwUTk,12924080,12930000,using their own judgment  to make their own decisions
_J6A7fAwUTk,12930000,12936960,about their reproductive freedom  and that was speaker nancy pelosi's  reaction to today's historic ruling from
_J6A7fAwUTk,12936960,12944479,the supreme court the conservative  majority has overturned the landmark roe  versus wade ruling which had established
_J6A7fAwUTk,12944479,12949600,the right to an abortion in america in a  6-3 ruling the court's conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,12949600,12956720,justices said roe was wrong from the  beginning and access to abortion should  be handled at the state level with the
_J6A7fAwUTk,12956720,12962720,decision 26 states will or are likely to  restrict abortion access some even have
_J6A7fAwUTk,12962720,12968560,trigger laws which ban abortions  immediately upon the court's decision
_J6A7fAwUTk,12968560,12975680,cbs news political contributor sean  sullivan joins us now he's also the  deputy politics editor for campaigns at
_J6A7fAwUTk,12975680,12981840,the washington post  i wanted to pick up on what speaker  pelosi said and that statement she put
_J6A7fAwUTk,12981840,12988160,out she says quote the rights of women  and all americans are on the ballot this  november
_J6A7fAwUTk,12988160,12993439,so is abortion going to be  democrats new central focus for the
_J6A7fAwUTk,12993439,12998560,midterms  well it seems pretty clear from the  statements that we have seen at least in
_J6A7fAwUTk,12998560,13005359,the early going so far today that that  is something that democrats  do want to run on they see this as an
_J6A7fAwUTk,13005359,13012880,issue that can energize not only their  base but an issue that they could use to  appeal to moderate voters to voters in
_J6A7fAwUTk,13012880,13020239,swing areas uh to women to men to voters  across the board and even before
_J6A7fAwUTk,13020239,13026319,this decision came down today we have  seen democrats talk about this a lot  more than republicans have talked about
_J6A7fAwUTk,13026319,13031920,at least in a political context at least  in a campaign context and so the early  indications uh at least from what we're
_J6A7fAwUTk,13031920,13039040,hearing today from speaker pelosi from  candidates uh democratic candidates for  senate for house for other races um it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,13039040,13046640,very clear down the early going that  they are uh looking to use this as a  sharp point of contrast in these midterm
_J6A7fAwUTk,13046640,13051760,elections and i think we're seeing this  virtually across the board right now and  you brought up republicans sean so how
_J6A7fAwUTk,13051760,13057279,are republicans reacting to this  decision politically because as we know  from polling the majority of americans
_J6A7fAwUTk,13057279,13063680,still support a woman's right to get an  abortion and we know even in not too you  know distant history even a lot of
_J6A7fAwUTk,13063680,13070720,republicans said that they supported  this right this hasn't always been a  blanket republican position so how are
_J6A7fAwUTk,13070720,13076319,they reacting to this decision  politically are they a little worried  about uh you know down ballot contests
_J6A7fAwUTk,13076319,13082319,considering that now this fight is  essentially being moved to those down  ballot uh contests
_J6A7fAwUTk,13082319,13088479,right and this now becomes a state by  state issue i think there has been for  some time now concern among republicans
_J6A7fAwUTk,13088479,13094479,about what the political fallout could  be uh in these midterm elections from  senate races to house races to to
_J6A7fAwUTk,13094479,13099840,state-level races as for the republican  response today we have seen some  republicans praise this decision i would
_J6A7fAwUTk,13099840,13106160,point to mitch mcconnell the minority  leader who you know every time he speaks  uh he chooses his words carefully and
_J6A7fAwUTk,13106160,13111680,you often see him try to set a tone not  just for senate republicans but for  republicans who are running for the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13111680,13117760,senate he called this uh you know a  historic victory but the question now is  how much do republicans want to talk
_J6A7fAwUTk,13117760,13124160,about this their midterm blueprint has  been centered very very heavily in  inflation in rising
_J6A7fAwUTk,13124160,13129359,gas prices in the rise in violent crime  that we've seen they are really really
_J6A7fAwUTk,13129359,13135359,trying to run on those issues and on top  of that tap into president biden's  unpopularity and a feeling that we're
_J6A7fAwUTk,13135359,13141439,seeing across the country among many  americans and his feelings reflected in  polls and focus groups and and elsewhere
_J6A7fAwUTk,13141439,13148720,that they're just not happy with  democratic leadership right now  democratic control of the white house  democratic control of congress and so i
_J6A7fAwUTk,13148720,13155680,think the fear that some republicans  have and have expressed in in recent  months is that does a decision like this
_J6A7fAwUTk,13155680,13162399,then change the landscape does it change  the sort of order of operations when  voters walk into the uh ballot
_J6A7fAwUTk,13162399,13167600,booth you know this year  what is going to be the top of mind  issue is it going to be the high price
_J6A7fAwUTk,13167600,13173600,of gas or is it going to be the supreme  court decision is it going to be crime  or is it going to be uh the supreme
_J6A7fAwUTk,13173600,13180239,court and abortion rights more generally  and so i think that some republicans  look at this and they say okay there was  a path politically speaking at least
_J6A7fAwUTk,13180239,13185680,that they felt very very confident about  walking down that would lead in their  view to winning back the house and
_J6A7fAwUTk,13185680,13190880,possibly winning back control of the  senate and i think now it's it's less  certain and so it's definitely worth
_J6A7fAwUTk,13190880,13196800,watching how republicans talk about this  issue because we've seen them before try  to strike a balance try to say look this
_J6A7fAwUTk,13196800,13202479,is the right thing i agree with this but  my state in some cases you hear  republicans say this my state has laws
_J6A7fAwUTk,13202479,13208640,on the books it's established i i'm not  going to argue against that um so it'll  be really interesting to see you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,13208640,13214560,how republicans deal with this and i  think they'll be really telling about  their strategy all right sean thank you  so much we're going to bring in now
_J6A7fAwUTk,13214560,13220720,jennifer popx she's the legislative  director for the national right to life  committee thanks for joining us jennifer
_J6A7fAwUTk,13220720,13227439,first  we have to ask your reaction to this  ruling  oh you know this is this is a great day

_J6A7fAwUTk,13233920,13239120,before me and that this is just a  wonderful day for mothers for their  unborn children we're we're extremely
_J6A7fAwUTk,13239120,13246080,excited  and jennifer as you know several states  over a dozen have preemptively codified  abortion access you know ahead of the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13246080,13253040,supreme court decision  do you think that those laws should now  be challenged
_J6A7fAwUTk,13253439,13259760,in terms of challenge  you know what what this decision means  is that this again becomes a debate that
_J6A7fAwUTk,13259760,13266399,goes to states and so some states are  going to um you know  spring into law or enact um you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,13266399,13271920,protective laws for unborn children and  other states are going to allow abortion  on demand and i think this is you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,13271920,13277840,this is uncharted territory but we know  that this is going to be something  that's going to be you know up to people
_J6A7fAwUTk,13277840,13283120,and their elected representatives state  by state congress will also have a rule  so we know some states will permit
_J6A7fAwUTk,13283120,13288239,abortion and others are going to protect  unborn children and you know it's going  to be a process that plays out here over
_J6A7fAwUTk,13288239,13294960,the next coming weeks and months uh to  that point house speaker nancy pelosi  said she believes republicans uh will
_J6A7fAwUTk,13294960,13301439,work to ban abortion access if they do  take control of the house and the senate  is this something your organization is
_J6A7fAwUTk,13301439,13306800,in favor of or should it remain up to  the voters of those individual states
_J6A7fAwUTk,13306800,13312720,oh certainly there's going to be a role  for for both i mean you know the states  are going to be the most immediate place
_J6A7fAwUTk,13312720,13318160,that these laws can take effect i think  we're far away a ways no you know no  matter the outcome of this election
_J6A7fAwUTk,13318160,13323199,where you know republicans are  you know predicted to to regain  majorities and we're you know going to
_J6A7fAwUTk,13323199,13329840,work hard to help like you know to make  sure that that's the case  you know there's going to be hurdles uh  in the senate it requires 60 votes to
_J6A7fAwUTk,13329840,13335439,pass anything and um the democrats have  put out the very radical women's health  protection act knowing this decision was
_J6A7fAwUTk,13335439,13340880,coming and did not even achieve 50 votes  on it so it's going to be a tall order  particularly in the senate and now that
_J6A7fAwUTk,13340880,13346560,your organization has achieved this  victory jennifer are you going to work  towards you know shoring up resources in
_J6A7fAwUTk,13346560,13351680,these states for  pregnant women who may be  you know who may need the help who who
_J6A7fAwUTk,13351680,13356880,would have otherwise perhaps had the  abortion are you are you going to work  on creating those resources that are so
_J6A7fAwUTk,13356880,13362720,needed the safety net the safety net  yeah  right i couldn't agree with you more and  that's something that we've been you
_J6A7fAwUTk,13362720,13368239,know working on it hasn't gotten a great  deal of attention but certain states to  the tune of you know tens of tens of
_J6A7fAwUTk,13368239,13374239,millions of dollars uh the texas  alternatives there's um the emma act  that we're working to promote in certain
_J6A7fAwUTk,13374239,13379920,states the every mom matters act we  absolutely know it's more critical now  than ever to connect moms with the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13379920,13385520,resources they're going to need this is  going to be you know  uncharted territory and i think it's  going to be one we're going to find
_J6A7fAwUTk,13385520,13392160,loving arms  in in pro-lifers and care centers that  have long been around we're going to  work to enhance those resources
_J6A7fAwUTk,13392160,13397920,certainly and jennifer part of the  criticism has been uh that the  organizations like yours have focused
_J6A7fAwUTk,13397920,13403520,their effort on onboard children what  happens to them once those children  are born
_J6A7fAwUTk,13403520,13410080,what resources are given to them from  from birth  on through their their education their
_J6A7fAwUTk,13410080,13416080,early education prenate  uh preschool care their their their food
_J6A7fAwUTk,13416080,13422800,resources um there are a number of  issues on the table because we're  dealing with a number of states that
_J6A7fAwUTk,13422800,13429120,just are already stretched from a social  standpoint  on the monies that come in mississippi
_J6A7fAwUTk,13429120,13434640,comes to mind louisiana um  alabama um
_J6A7fAwUTk,13434640,13440080,what other i mean you mentioned texas  i'm curious in those states specifically
_J6A7fAwUTk,13440080,13447680,what are some of the  where have you made strides there when  children are born into poverty
_J6A7fAwUTk,13447680,13454479,um  certainly what we're trying to work on  going forward now with every piece of  legislation we're going to try to
_J6A7fAwUTk,13454479,13460640,include  an expansion of resources that are  available in that state for health care  for the sorts of things that you're
_J6A7fAwUTk,13460640,13465680,talking about and we're going to look at  more options going forward and there's  also a huge array of federal resources
_J6A7fAwUTk,13465680,13472399,and i know that certain members of  congress have been extremely interested  in the republicans have been interested  in highlighting not only the existing
_J6A7fAwUTk,13472399,13478880,resources that are out there between  everything from the trip program to wic  to early childhood education but to you
_J6A7fAwUTk,13478880,13485279,know expanding some of these resources i  think you know this was just  this is just the beginning and so we
_J6A7fAwUTk,13485279,13491840,know that these resources are going to  need to be connected uh to the moms into  these babies um and support them as they
_J6A7fAwUTk,13491840,13497680,grow so you know it's it's going to be a  priority for us going forward and it has  been and i think there's a huge interest
_J6A7fAwUTk,13497680,13504160,in making it a strong priority there's a  new effort to concentrate on that right  absolutely jennifer poppeck we thank you

_J6A7fAwUTk,13610800,13618080,breaking news out of the supreme court  the conservative majority has overturned  roe versus wade ending the federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,13618080,13624800,protection of a woman's right to an  abortion the ruling upholds a  mississippi law that bans abortions at
_J6A7fAwUTk,13624800,13632640,15 weeks of pregnancy the opinion says  the constitution does not guarantee  abortion rights it called the 1973
_J6A7fAwUTk,13632640,13638239,precedent quote egregiously wrong and  says it is now up to individual states
_J6A7fAwUTk,13638239,13644720,to decide the legality of abortion now  this decision will also spark so-called
_J6A7fAwUTk,13644720,13651840,trigger laws in more than a dozen states  which will also make abortion legal  there we just heard the president
_J6A7fAwUTk,13651840,13659199,slamming the decision  it was three justices named by one
_J6A7fAwUTk,13659199,13665680,president  donald trump  were the core of today's decision to  upend the scales of justice and
_J6A7fAwUTk,13665680,13672960,eliminate a fundamental right for women  in this country  make no mistake
_J6A7fAwUTk,13672960,13679279,this decision is a culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades  to upset
_J6A7fAwUTk,13679279,13685520,balance of our law  now let's bring in cbs news chief  washington correspondent major garrett
_J6A7fAwUTk,13685520,13692399,who is live at the supreme court first  um i know it's a changing situation a  changing dynamic out there
_J6A7fAwUTk,13692399,13699600,what are you seeing now  so the president and his remarks very  near the end said all reaction to this
_J6A7fAwUTk,13699600,13705920,supreme court decision landmark as it is  should be peaceful there should be no  aggression no intimidation no violence
_J6A7fAwUTk,13705920,13710960,of any kind and i can tell you i've been  here all morning this is a peaceable
_J6A7fAwUTk,13710960,13716960,protest and assemblage there are those  who oppose abortion rights who are  delighted i would say elated because
_J6A7fAwUTk,13716960,13723600,they've told me so  about today's decision and those who  support abortion rights who are deeply  deeply embittered by this court and some
_J6A7fAwUTk,13723600,13729600,of the language i must tell you is very  strident those who oppose abortion  rights believe those who advocate for it
_J6A7fAwUTk,13729600,13736720,are essentially in their words not mine  ruthless cold-blooded murderers who have  no care or belief or support for an
_J6A7fAwUTk,13736720,13743520,unborn child those who support abortion  rights have described the supreme court  you see behind me as a christian
_J6A7fAwUTk,13743520,13749920,fascist theocracy those are the kind of  words being  spoken here in reaction to this now one
_J6A7fAwUTk,13749920,13755199,thing i also want to let you know the  crowd is growing in size i'd say it's  about two or three times larger than it
_J6A7fAwUTk,13755199,13761520,was when this opinion was handed down at  10 10 eastern this morning but again  peaceful and subdued
_J6A7fAwUTk,13761520,13767359,there's no rancor there is no fisticuffs  there's no pushing there's no shoving  and probably at least one reason for
_J6A7fAwUTk,13767359,13774640,that is the very very noticeable  sizeable presence of metropolitan police  us capitol police and of course the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13774640,13781439,court itself is heavily protected yeah  you can see the fences two layers of  bike fence and the big black fence
_J6A7fAwUTk,13781439,13787760,in here and positioned here since the  release of that draft majority opinion  deeply reflected in today's actual
_J6A7fAwUTk,13787760,13793760,opinion from the supreme court so the  supreme court that has decreed this new  constitutional orientation toward
_J6A7fAwUTk,13793760,13800160,abortion is closed off to the very  people it's asking to agree with yeah  and i guarantee you half of the people
_J6A7fAwUTk,13800160,13806800,here do not agree it's a pretty jarring  visual to see the supreme court behind  those fences and sort of locked away
_J6A7fAwUTk,13806800,13812239,in these united states but major i  wanted to ask you were you able to  listen to the president's speech moments  ago and
_J6A7fAwUTk,13812239,13818319,what's your reaction and was there any  reaction from the crowd  so the crowd i don't believe was
_J6A7fAwUTk,13818319,13823359,listening to the president's remarks  there's no there was nothing evident in  reaction i didn't see a lot of people
_J6A7fAwUTk,13823359,13828479,looking into their phones trying to  catch it on any live streaming coverage  i think people who are here know what
_J6A7fAwUTk,13828479,13835439,they think about this issue those who  oppose abortion rights consider this a  day of triumph a vindication of a
_J6A7fAwUTk,13835439,13842239,essentially a victory 50 years in the  making from their perspective though not  all of them are old enough to have  fought in the trenches on that side of
_J6A7fAwUTk,13842239,13847439,the movement all that time but are  elated genuinely elated when this  decision was handed down some fell to
_J6A7fAwUTk,13847439,13854160,their knees and wept tears of joy those  who support abortion rights as i said  using that rhetoric very embittered but
_J6A7fAwUTk,13854160,13859199,they also have told me they believe that  this is now a galvanizing moment
_J6A7fAwUTk,13859199,13864880,politically for this issue they told me  you know so many people that they have  talked to who support abortion rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,13864880,13870239,generally never thought this day would  come and i've talked to advocates here  who've been working this issue saying
_J6A7fAwUTk,13870239,13876640,for the better part of two years hey  this right is going to be taken away  this supreme court is moving in this
_J6A7fAwUTk,13876640,13882640,direction and many people they talked to  they told me said no that's never going  to happen  and now it has and they believe
_J6A7fAwUTk,13882640,13889040,fundamentally that will change this  political question from what on the  supporting abortion rights side was an
_J6A7fAwUTk,13889040,13894319,abstraction to now a very real  retrenchment in defined rights in this
_J6A7fAwUTk,13894319,13900960,country what does privacy mean and what  doesn't it mean and they believe that  will change not only the political  debate but the political dynamic in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13900960,13908000,nation's capital and every state capital  across the country let's bring in thank  you major i wanted to go to uh cbs news
_J6A7fAwUTk,13908000,13913760,chief white house correspondent nancy  cordes uh who  i'm sure has reaction to what the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13913760,13921680,president said but but specifically what  stood out to me was how he said this  takes us back 150 years and i was just
_J6A7fAwUTk,13921680,13927520,curious because that struck me  what was he referring to in your  estimation
_J6A7fAwUTk,13927520,13934239,he was referring to the fact that even  before  roe versus wade michelle there were
_J6A7fAwUTk,13934239,13940160,states that allowed abortion and that  this was a right that was recognized at
_J6A7fAwUTk,13940160,13946760,least to some degree at the federal  level even before  the roe versus white wade case in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,13946760,13952080,1970s it's an interesting comment from  this particular president whose own
_J6A7fAwUTk,13952080,13958560,views on abortion abortion legislation  and even roe versus wade have really
_J6A7fAwUTk,13958560,13963920,evolved over time when he first came  into office in the 1970s president biden
_J6A7fAwUTk,13963920,13970640,said that he thought roe versus wade was  wrongly decided and that it was overly  bro broad and that as a as a roman
_J6A7fAwUTk,13970640,13976399,catholic he he believed in the the  universal right to life and
_J6A7fAwUTk,13976399,13982960,he continued to vote  in favor of restricting abortion for  at least a decade after that but over
_J6A7fAwUTk,13982960,13989760,time um  he did start to move more in the  direction of most in his party  and the position he he came to in more
_J6A7fAwUTk,13989760,13997040,recent years is that while he himself is  personally uh  anti-abortion rights uh that he doesn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,13997040,14004640,believe that he should impose his faith  on anyone else or his beliefs on anyone  else and he believes in uh in in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14004640,14009680,right  for every woman to make her own decision  so that's where he's at right now that's
_J6A7fAwUTk,14009680,14016880,what you heard uh coming from him in his  speech today what you didn't hear coming  from him was a whole lot of specifics
_J6A7fAwUTk,14016880,14024399,about how he plans to ensure  that that right is at least partially  upheld now that this decision has come
_J6A7fAwUTk,14024399,14030239,down he did say that he was going to be  directing the department of health and  human services to ensure that abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,14030239,14036160,pills are made more widely available but  he didn't go into any specifics about  how he plans to do that he didn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,14036160,14041840,announce any new executive orders it  doesn't mean that those executive orders  won't be forthcoming
_J6A7fAwUTk,14041840,14049199,in the coming weeks but it appears that  the white house for now decided that the  message today should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,14049199,14054479,more simple and straightforward which is  to  argue against what the supreme court has
_J6A7fAwUTk,14054479,14060160,just done and to push americans who  disagree with this decision to vote for
_J6A7fAwUTk,14060160,14065680,democrats in november if they want to  have any chance of
_J6A7fAwUTk,14065680,14071600,seeing a federal law that establishes  the universal right to an abortion in
_J6A7fAwUTk,14071600,14077040,all 50 states he did make it a  galvanizing call to voters for sure and  nancy you bring up a good point though
_J6A7fAwUTk,14077040,14082399,as you pointed out the president's own  stance on abortion has evolved somewhat  through the years you know abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,14082399,14088000,rights have not always been such a  politically polarizing issue there have  been plenty of democratic catholics
_J6A7fAwUTk,14088000,14093920,through the years who have been sort of  you know anti-abortion access and there  have been republicans through the years
_J6A7fAwUTk,14093920,14100640,who've been openly you know pro-abortion  access so how did it sort of crystallize  to where we are right now what was the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14100640,14107040,sort of  what was the historical basis for the  sort of entrenched political  polarization we're seeing now
_J6A7fAwUTk,14107040,14112960,well a big part of it was the fact that  moderate  lawmakers on both sides were voted out  of office
_J6A7fAwUTk,14112960,14119199,as their parties became more polarized  it became more difficult  to get re-elected
_J6A7fAwUTk,14119199,14125199,as a democrat in a right-leaning state  became more difficult to get re-elected  as a republican in a left-leaning state
_J6A7fAwUTk,14125199,14130399,it became more difficult  as a republican for example to to get
_J6A7fAwUTk,14130399,14136479,elected if you uh moved away from party  orthodoxy in your particular district
_J6A7fAwUTk,14136479,14143680,you would likely get defeated in your  primary by a more conservative candidate  and so we've seen
_J6A7fAwUTk,14143680,14151359,more and more of these moderates  disappear you know there were a handful  of senate democrats for example who
_J6A7fAwUTk,14151359,14157279,actually voted to confirm justice  kavanaugh it wasn't just senator joe  manchin who is now
_J6A7fAwUTk,14157279,14163920,expressing disappointment in man in in  kavanaugh who says he he didn't tell him  the truth uh but there were a couple
_J6A7fAwUTk,14163920,14170800,other  moderate democratic senators who voted  for kavanaugh  who have since been been voted out of
_J6A7fAwUTk,14170800,14177439,office because they came from red states  so you just it's just a  primarily a function of of the vanishing
_J6A7fAwUTk,14177439,14184080,middle  along with the fact that um you know  that this issue has really become sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,14184080,14190000,of one of the central litmus tests for  democrats and republicans alike and that
_J6A7fAwUTk,14190000,14195600,has been the case uh ever since i  started covering washington in the 1990s
_J6A7fAwUTk,14195600,14203359,great way to put it yeah let thank you  nancy we're going to go now to our chief  legal correspondent jan crawford uh jan
_J6A7fAwUTk,14203359,14210399,thanks for joining us um  so i i we can't we there's been a lot of  discussion about chief justice john
_J6A7fAwUTk,14210399,14216800,roberts and his role in this decision  and an almost uh sort of ethereal sort
_J6A7fAwUTk,14216800,14222319,of disappearance of of his role on the  court as any kind of leader as a leader
_J6A7fAwUTk,14222319,14229199,of this court so what can you tell us  about that well the chief justice just  has one vote like the rest of them so
_J6A7fAwUTk,14229199,14235439,you know he has as the leader of the  court he can kind of make sure the  trains run on time uh but he doesn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,14235439,14240640,have any more power to vote than the  rest of them do so you know the what  happened with the chief justice he was
_J6A7fAwUTk,14240640,14246160,the swing vote he was always the one we  saw him save uh obamacare president
_J6A7fAwUTk,14246160,14251920,obama's signature health care  legislation and uh by joining with the  liberals because he was kind of the one
_J6A7fAwUTk,14251920,14259439,in the middle well now with three new  justices appointed by president trump  including uh the last one who replaced
_J6A7fAwUTk,14259439,14264479,the late justice ruth bader ginsburg  roberts doesn't have that kind of power  to swing the vote his vote doesn't
_J6A7fAwUTk,14264479,14272239,matter as much anymore that's why we saw  today it only it takes five votes to get  to a decision and there's five without
_J6A7fAwUTk,14272239,14278800,john roberts and yeah and speaking of  you know we want to hear a little bit  more from the dissent so what more can
_J6A7fAwUTk,14278800,14284000,you tell us about that what were the  points made  well the dissents were as you would  expect
_J6A7fAwUTk,14284000,14289279,you know  quite comprehensive and i think what was  notable is that they were it was a joint
_J6A7fAwUTk,14289279,14295520,descent  where they all it was it was the three  liberal justices together
_J6A7fAwUTk,14295520,14300640,as one voice  speaking so powerfully about how they  believe that the court has really
_J6A7fAwUTk,14300640,14306239,deprived women of uh equality uh and  equal treatment and this would have
_J6A7fAwUTk,14306239,14313040,devastating consequences for women so i  mean it was it was uh as you would  expect an incredibly powerful dissent by
_J6A7fAwUTk,14313040,14319359,those three i i think that you know  obviously  i find it incredibly ironic that the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14319359,14325439,dissenter that we think of in some of  these issues in these cases once was  justice ruth bader ginsburg who devoted
_J6A7fAwUTk,14325439,14334080,her whole entire life to working for  reproductive rights and reproductive  equality and had she uh retired earlier
_J6A7fAwUTk,14334080,14341760,where say a democratic president could  have replaced her roe vs wade would  still be the law of the land so she was
_J6A7fAwUTk,14341760,14348239,replaced by a republican nominee  nominated by president trump because she  she died while she was on the bench so
_J6A7fAwUTk,14348239,14354960,that those are the kind of things that  can affect the direction and future of  the supreme court and this is likely to
_J6A7fAwUTk,14354960,14360960,be the supreme court for a long time um  and so when we talk about you know
_J6A7fAwUTk,14360960,14367760,protesting at the court or what what can  people do or what should people do  you know it's over at the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,14367760,14372800,now it's going to go to the states it's  going to go to congress the court is  saying take it to your elected officials
_J6A7fAwUTk,14372800,14379040,that's the way it was until 1973 there  was never a federal right in the  constitution no state had ever
_J6A7fAwUTk,14379040,14384160,recognized one until the supreme court  for the first time i mean no no court
_J6A7fAwUTk,14384160,14389840,until the first time the supreme court  did in 1973 and that decision was wrong  it was wrongly decided then and it's
_J6A7fAwUTk,14389840,14395359,wrongly decided today the question is  going to be now what are people going to  do about it when you see the president
_J6A7fAwUTk,14395359,14402160,talking about  maternal mortality and maternal health  uh you know this is a moment where you
_J6A7fAwUTk,14402160,14407199,could find some consensus that people on  both sides could come together and say  we need to do something about that in
_J6A7fAwUTk,14407199,14414399,the meantime you can do all these other  things but you know where can we make  improvements for people who are really  going to be affected by this ruling who
_J6A7fAwUTk,14414399,14420880,now don't have that option of seeking  abortion in some of these red states who  may not have the funds to travel
_J6A7fAwUTk,14420880,14426160,to you know half the states that will  still allow it  you can talk about things president
_J6A7fAwUTk,14426160,14432319,biden can do he's pretty limited  even the idea of federal funds for  travel there's a federal law in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14432319,14439359,books that prohibits federal funds for  abortion generally that's that's going  to be i think a really hard road to hoe
_J6A7fAwUTk,14439359,14446318,so  aside from where people said the wrong  answer to your question yeah
_J6A7fAwUTk,14446479,14451040,i mean i'm sorry  no
_J6A7fAwUTk,14452239,14458720,just kind of like looking at this as a  lay person watching what would actually  happen actually over the last two days
_J6A7fAwUTk,14458720,14465760,uh the lay person might look at this and  say you know wait a minute so states  have control on this one issue
_J6A7fAwUTk,14465760,14473040,uh and yet  the federal government has control on  this other issue about the gun case
_J6A7fAwUTk,14473279,14478640,and so when you look at sort of like the  supreme court appears to be kind of like
_J6A7fAwUTk,14478640,14486080,on  an a case-by-case  uh issue on a various number of of
_J6A7fAwUTk,14486080,14492640,subjects here and and you look at this  concept of starry decisis or a precedent
_J6A7fAwUTk,14492640,14498479,you know which is central to the supreme  court ruling uh but you have a situation  where the majority of justices went
_J6A7fAwUTk,14498479,14506800,against precedent so when you look at  like it seems like they're  cherry-picking to the layperson uh a
_J6A7fAwUTk,14506800,14515199,decision that isn't based on uh what has  been done before or what has been done  in the past or at least even on the same
_J6A7fAwUTk,14515199,14520960,side  of okay this is a states issue states  have rights versus like well the federal
_J6A7fAwUTk,14520960,14526080,government has uh extensive control here  so i mean right where what's going on
_J6A7fAwUTk,14526080,14532880,here i guess is my question you know i  think that the bottom line is elections  matter and republican presidents as
_J6A7fAwUTk,14532880,14539040,we've seen are going to nominate  justices who see  uh the constitution in a more narrow way
_J6A7fAwUTk,14539040,14546800,and so they're going to look to the  words of the constitution and they're  going to look to history and they're not  willing to say or to expand those rights
_J6A7fAwUTk,14546800,14552640,if it's not really kind of what the the  framers originally meant so for example  yesterday we saw the supreme court
_J6A7fAwUTk,14552640,14558080,strike down a new york law a state law  uh that uh imposed a kind of an extra
_J6A7fAwUTk,14558080,14563279,hoop on lawful gun owners if they wanted  to get a permit so you know they said no
_J6A7fAwUTk,14563279,14569439,you can't do that that violates the  second amendment well and then we saw  today uh the courts say like well you
_J6A7fAwUTk,14569439,14575120,know the court's not gonna read anything  into the constitution states just do  whatever you want on abortion it's not
_J6A7fAwUTk,14575120,14581520,in our backyard anymore  i mean obviously that seems totally  inconsistent but if you're a  conservative
_J6A7fAwUTk,14581520,14587120,legal scholar  and this is the philosophy they have you  look to the words of the constitution
_J6A7fAwUTk,14587120,14593199,and the text the history uh you look to  what the meaning of i mean what the the  framers meant and that's what they did
_J6A7fAwUTk,14593199,14598960,in both those cases the second amendment  is a lot different the words of that  amendment is a lot different than the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14598960,14604239,due process clause of the the 14th  amendment which just talks about a  general liberty but a lot of people
_J6A7fAwUTk,14604239,14611120,would argue there's still a lot of room  for interpretation and that second  amendment right to bear arms right  there's a lot of yeah and that is a
_J6A7fAwUTk,14611120,14616560,liberal judicial philosophy right and  that's the the difference in how you see  these various constitutional
_J6A7fAwUTk,14616560,14622239,interpretations and again bottom line is  elections matter and so you know the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14622239,14628720,president gets to make these choices  and the senate gets to confirm them  right and so if you happen to be in a
_J6A7fAwUTk,14628720,14633840,moment where you have a republican  president and a republican senate you're  going to be able to put on someone who
_J6A7fAwUTk,14633840,14639840,has a conservative legal philosophy and  that's exactly what happened in the  presidency of donald trump so when you
_J6A7fAwUTk,14639840,14646319,hear people say go out to vote that's  that's uh that affects the united states  supreme court and how they interpret
_J6A7fAwUTk,14646319,14651439,rights or don't interpret rights yeah  okay rebecca you you've been sticking
_J6A7fAwUTk,14651439,14657279,with us all the time which is so great  and so appreciated you know  our viewers are probably aware that
_J6A7fAwUTk,14657279,14663359,there are 13 states that have trigger  laws in place which means they're about  to go into effect either now or within
_J6A7fAwUTk,14663359,14669040,the month  which you know each law is slightly  different but they essentially
_J6A7fAwUTk,14669040,14675040,ban uh you know are pretty or pretty  complete bans so for people who live in
_J6A7fAwUTk,14675040,14680960,these states  what do they need to know  well i mean they need to know where if
_J6A7fAwUTk,14680960,14686720,they are looking to get an abortion they  will need to know where nearby abortion
_J6A7fAwUTk,14686720,14692960,clinics might be whether they can travel  there where there might be some funding  for that travel um there you know the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14692960,14699120,the those laws go into effect and fairly  immediately the access to abortion  within their state
_J6A7fAwUTk,14699120,14704479,will end right that's  there are i want to say the ones that  are immediate i'm just going to say are
_J6A7fAwUTk,14704479,14710319,kentucky louisiana and south dakota all  right  can we go back to that graphic
_J6A7fAwUTk,14710319,14717359,uh it's really important we we pinpoint  this graphic that you just had up here  we go there you go so the immediate ones
_J6A7fAwUTk,14717359,14724000,are louisiana kentucky and south dakota  and then within 30 days  idaho tennessee
_J6A7fAwUTk,14724000,14731840,texas  arkansas mississippi missouri  north dakota oklahoma
_J6A7fAwUTk,14731840,14737680,utah wyoming  i think that's i think that's the  complete list
_J6A7fAwUTk,14737680,14745040,so what you know it's it's like and so  some of these are pretty much landlocked  yeah um that you'd have to go through
_J6A7fAwUTk,14745040,14750080,three states in order to access you know  a legal abortion but there's some there
_J6A7fAwUTk,14750080,14755680,there's even a question as to whether or  not in some cases people will be able to  travel
_J6A7fAwUTk,14755680,14762560,to  to  across state lines to get an abortion if  they so choose or decide to do that
_J6A7fAwUTk,14762560,14768160,right and i mean there's also a question  about access to information so you know  i am sure that there are groups out
_J6A7fAwUTk,14768160,14775520,there who are working already and have  in the works ways to give this  information information about the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14775520,14780880,pill that works as an abortion pill and  ways to think about travel and to get
_J6A7fAwUTk,14780880,14786560,funds but how is that information going  to be disseminated to people who need it
_J6A7fAwUTk,14786560,14792479,especially those who  do not have  means to
_J6A7fAwUTk,14792479,14798640,access that information on their own  absolutely and jan if you're still with  us can you comment on how this might
_J6A7fAwUTk,14798640,14804800,affect other 14th amendment cases  well that's been a huge question  obviously and remember we got the the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14804800,14810000,draft opinion that was leaked about two  months ago  that said and justice alito and that
_J6A7fAwUTk,14810000,14815279,draft opinion said it's not going to i  thought it was interesting that today
_J6A7fAwUTk,14815279,14821279,the court actually went into a little  more analysis on that and said that it  doesn't and i don't know
_J6A7fAwUTk,14821279,14827359,we don't know how we can be more clear  the right to contraception and a right  to same-sex marriage
_J6A7fAwUTk,14827359,14834399,yes while grounded in some of the same  constitutional protections as the right  to an abortion was that abortion is
_J6A7fAwUTk,14834399,14840720,different it is unique because unlike  the other issues abortion involves the  life of someone else this is how the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14840720,14845920,court put it now there was one justice  justice clarence thomas who wrote  separately just
_J6A7fAwUTk,14845920,14851199,by himself  saying but i think that it does affect  those other cases but you know like
_J6A7fAwUTk,14851199,14857439,we've been discussing you know day in  and day out it takes five votes uh at  the supreme court and right now justice
_J6A7fAwUTk,14857439,14864399,thomas who is the most conservative  justice uh who is willing to look at any  president uh is the only one that says
_J6A7fAwUTk,14864399,14871199,that so james is he signaling that he  would reverse  you know same-sex
_J6A7fAwUTk,14871199,14876399,because he doesn't think that you know  the the liberty interest found in in the
_J6A7fAwUTk,14876399,14881760,due process clause of the 14th amendment  uh you know it's kind of he thinks  that's just kind of made-up law so he's
_J6A7fAwUTk,14881760,14887359,saying like yeah that's on the table too  but he's the only one that's my point  and so you're either gonna
_J6A7fAwUTk,14887359,14892960,potentially you're gonna have to have  four more justices who agree with  justice thomas uh you know appointed by
_J6A7fAwUTk,14892960,14899279,presidents down the road right now the  other  uh who agree that rose should be
_J6A7fAwUTk,14899279,14905520,overturned or emphasizing that no  those cases are not on the table because
_J6A7fAwUTk,14905520,14912159,abortion is different so justice thomas  is on an island as far as this country  and that's not unusual that's not
_J6A7fAwUTk,14912159,14917520,unusual justice thomas is  perfectly fine being out there on an  island of his own he's been like that
_J6A7fAwUTk,14917520,14924080,since he joined the court he was willing  to go his own way  he doesn't really care what people think
_J6A7fAwUTk,14924080,14930080,he thinks his duty is to follow the law  or this he says how you know how he  thinks the law should be interpreted so
_J6A7fAwUTk,14930080,14935359,i you know to me  it's it's a it's another concurring  opinion from justice thomas uh by
_J6A7fAwUTk,14935359,14940720,himself right now all right jan crawford  we thank you rebecca ruffy we thank you

_J6A7fAwUTk,15158479,15165040,abortion here in america that's right in  a six to three ruling the court's  conservative justices said roe was wrong
_J6A7fAwUTk,15165040,15171920,from the beginning and access to  abortions should be handled at the state  level with that decision 26 states will
_J6A7fAwUTk,15171920,15179680,or are likely to restrict abortion  access some even have trigger laws in  place which ban abortion immediately
_J6A7fAwUTk,15179680,15184880,upon the court's decision or within the  next 30 days joining us now is dr
_J6A7fAwUTk,15184880,15191279,stephanie guston she's medical director  for the heartland center for  reproductive medicine dr gustin
_J6A7fAwUTk,15191279,15197279,thank you for joining us uh regarding  this change  in federal law what does this mean in
_J6A7fAwUTk,15197279,15203199,regards to  fertility treatments for women  yeah that's a really great question
_J6A7fAwUTk,15203199,15209120,thank you so much for having me you know  at this very moment nothing has changed  i think everyone in the public needs to
_J6A7fAwUTk,15209120,15215120,know that  um cause i think a lot of people are  pretty worried appropriately  but i think at a state by state level it
_J6A7fAwUTk,15215120,15221600,really depends on the language of the  trigger bands that exist in the language  of the bills that are
_J6A7fAwUTk,15221600,15228000,up for  you know a re-vote or a re-eval and so  what we're doing as fertility
_J6A7fAwUTk,15228000,15233439,specialists  in nebraska but also nationally is  really trying to educate our
_J6A7fAwUTk,15233439,15241359,constituents so patients friends family  of people who are fertility  patients but also probably equally as
_J6A7fAwUTk,15241359,15246479,importantly is  our legislators and our senators you  know we want
_J6A7fAwUTk,15246479,15251680,um  fertility patients who are one and eight  in the population to be supported but we
_J6A7fAwUTk,15251680,15258159,really need the other seven and eight so  all all of us at the table  working to protect fertility care
_J6A7fAwUTk,15258159,15264880,so dr gustin can we get specific if you  don't mind because we do know that you  know a lot of fertility treatments
_J6A7fAwUTk,15264880,15271840,involve creating embryos that are either  you know frozen and used later or not  used and sometimes the embryos that are
_J6A7fAwUTk,15271840,15276960,not used are destroyed  is any of this going to be covered under
_J6A7fAwUTk,15276960,15282319,this new ruling  that's a  it's also an excellent question and it
_J6A7fAwUTk,15282319,15289040,really it really depends so previously  legislation was  brought to the table in nebraska failed
_J6A7fAwUTk,15289040,15294640,that looked at defining life at  fertilization  and gave no protections thereafter so
_J6A7fAwUTk,15294640,15300080,you're right you know a fertilized egg  is an early embryo
_J6A7fAwUTk,15300080,15307279,and if if  language and in the law states that that  is a life that has equal protection as
_J6A7fAwUTk,15307279,15313279,of that of a walking breathing speaking  human being we're in trouble when we go  to
_J6A7fAwUTk,15313279,15319040,culture those embryos or thaw those  embryos  so what we're doing is really trying to
_J6A7fAwUTk,15319040,15324159,educate everyone that they're not the  same thing um and to really make the
_J6A7fAwUTk,15324159,15332080,language clear  um in future discussions and legislative  sessions what you know what really ibf
_J6A7fAwUTk,15332080,15337840,is and what it isn't and so at this  point nothing has changed in your  ability to help your patients is that
_J6A7fAwUTk,15337840,15344479,correct  correct and again i just think that  that's really important for everyone to  know right now everything is as it is
_J6A7fAwUTk,15344479,15351520,and we are working tirelessly we've been  working since the leaked um opinion a  couple months back to really start to
_J6A7fAwUTk,15351520,15358560,lay the groundwork and educate the  public at large as well as our our  senators of how important language is
_J6A7fAwUTk,15358560,15363680,right now yeah language and  definitions in particular because
_J6A7fAwUTk,15363680,15370720,you could take  you know what you know this this means  all the way back to like a woman's you
_J6A7fAwUTk,15370720,15376640,know  her egg not just an embryo but but her  egg a man's sperm i mean there were
_J6A7fAwUTk,15376640,15382800,there were discussions as to you know  where does how far does it get life  begin  and i guess you're going to it's a
_J6A7fAwUTk,15382800,15389040,re-education really  well i think i think the part of the  problem is that that's a philosophical
_J6A7fAwUTk,15389040,15396720,question right that's not a scientific  question and and i think that we kind of  muddy those those sentiments together um
_J6A7fAwUTk,15396720,15402479,but i think we need to be really careful  because not everybody subscribes to the  same philosophy that's true that's right
_J6A7fAwUTk,15402479,15408159,and  for some it's it's a religious issue for  others it's not right so uh there's that
_J6A7fAwUTk,15408159,15414880,piece of it so you know doctor what  would you advise women there are women  out there who may be worried about their
_J6A7fAwUTk,15414880,15421279,ability to get pregnant in the near  future and they're worried about  fertility treatment changes
_J6A7fAwUTk,15421279,15426319,there's a lot of mystery shrouding for  fertility treatment as it is right it's  something that a lot of people are not
_J6A7fAwUTk,15426319,15432239,comfortable talking about openly  so where would you advise women to go  who need some clarity who are perhaps
_J6A7fAwUTk,15432239,15437760,worried about their own reproductive  future yeah but also don't want sort of  like to get
_J6A7fAwUTk,15437760,15443600,you know the big surprise at the end  here  okay so a few things i think that's a
_J6A7fAwUTk,15443600,15451120,great question one is you don't need a  referral to cf fertility specialist so  if anybody's concerned they can always
_J6A7fAwUTk,15451120,15456399,make an appointment just to be educated  that's what we're here for  um the american side of reproductive
_J6A7fAwUTk,15456399,15463600,medicine is an excellent resource for  patients um as well as resolve which is  another wonderful organization
_J6A7fAwUTk,15463600,15469520,i think  people really need to spend time locally  speaking to their legislatures and
_J6A7fAwUTk,15469520,15475600,senators about their concerns because  believe it or not they are our  representatives and our opinions and
_J6A7fAwUTk,15475600,15482560,concerns matter so that's actually been  really profound here in nebraska and i  think the more people speak out about
_J6A7fAwUTk,15482560,15489520,their concerns about access to fertility  care the more and more people are  listening so  i think as patients want education
_J6A7fAwUTk,15489520,15496560,that's why we're here come see us  follow people on instagram there's a lot  of wonderful fertility doctors providing
_J6A7fAwUTk,15496560,15503680,just information about infertility  online all the time including myself  and then um you know speak out don't
_J6A7fAwUTk,15503680,15510159,don't be afraid to not  to  to share your concerns with both your  friends your neighbors your family your
_J6A7fAwUTk,15510159,15517120,colleagues but also your representatives  that's why they're there yeah dr gustin  how how do you thread that needle um as
_J6A7fAwUTk,15517120,15524239,as we already said there there there is  there's such a divide and they're  they're they're varying opinions on this
_J6A7fAwUTk,15524239,15529439,issue  specifically with regard to fertility uh  to
_J6A7fAwUTk,15529439,15536880,you know education surrounding fertility  and and pregnancy  how do you thread that needle
_J6A7fAwUTk,15536880,15543199,yeah you know  what i do could not be more pro family  right and i think it's really
_J6A7fAwUTk,15543199,15548800,disheartening that it's getting looped  into all of this and i think we just  have to remind
_J6A7fAwUTk,15548800,15554560,everyone that the goal of fertility  specialists is to help families who
_J6A7fAwUTk,15554560,15560960,desperately want to have children become  parents  and and we want to continue providing  that care and i think people really need
_J6A7fAwUTk,15560960,15567359,to fully understand um  what we're here to do  and to honor that request of patients
_J6A7fAwUTk,15567359,15573040,who really want to become parents right  so i think it's just  really trying to be thoughtfully
_J6A7fAwUTk,15573040,15578479,educating the community  to be good listeners to understand what
_J6A7fAwUTk,15578479,15584560,barriers people may have in their  understanding of what we do  and trying to speak in a way that that
_J6A7fAwUTk,15584560,15590720,people can really appreciate that it's  good to talk about it openly right it's  always it's never a good thing when  there's too much mystery surrounding
_J6A7fAwUTk,15590720,15596000,something because then people can fill  in the blanks right so it's better to be  open and right
_J6A7fAwUTk,15596000,15602159,and  talk about the treatments but uh you  know dr gustin thank you so much for  joining us we know that what you do is
