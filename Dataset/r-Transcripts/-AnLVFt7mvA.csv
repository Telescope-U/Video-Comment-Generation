-AnLVFt7mvA,0,4160,"There’s currently a ton of hype  over Apple’s brand new M2 MacBooks,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,4160,10000,"and that’s why we’ve already ordered 4 M2  MacBook Pros for our in-depth comparisons,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,10880,17200,but we’re already seeing reports about Apple’s  higher-end M2 Pro and M2 Max MacBook Pros going  
-AnLVFt7mvA,17200,22880,"into production very soon, and based on all of  my research, I have a pretty good feeling that  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,22880,29439,these 14 and 16” MacBook Pros are gonna  be A LOT more powerful than expected.
-AnLVFt7mvA,29440,33200,"So in this video, I’m gonna  explain why I’m now fully convinced  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,33200,38880,that Apple’s M2 Pro and Max chips will  actually be built on TSMC’s brand new  
-AnLVFt7mvA,39680,44720,"3nm process node technology, contrary to the  mainstream belief that they’ll be based on  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,44720,48320,the M2 chip’s 2nd-gen 5nm chip  technology that everyone’s expecting.
-AnLVFt7mvA,48320,52480,"And yes, I know that sounds crazy because  it’s the complete opposite of what Apple did  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,52480,60640,"with their M1 chips, where the entire lineup was  based on the same 1st-gen 5nm node, but trust me,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,60640,65920,"by the end of this video, I think you’ll  be convinced as well, so let’s get started."
-AnLVFt7mvA,65920,70240,"First off, I wanna provide evidence  from multiple sources that TSMC’s  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,70240,78240,3nm chip tech should be ready in time for the  launch of Apple’s M2 Pro and M2 Max MacBooks Pros.
-AnLVFt7mvA,78240,81840,"Back in March, Mark Gurman reported  that Apple will likely not launch the  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,81840,88240,"new 14 and 16” MacBook Pro models until  2023, and just a couple of weeks ago,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,88240,93280,"he mentioned that they could launch either  at the end of 2022, or in early 2023."
-AnLVFt7mvA,93920,99759,"Now in my opinion, I think early  2023, specifically at a Spring event  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,99760,103520,"makes the most sense for the  launch of these MacBook Pros,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,103520,108640,and that’s because I fully believe Apple’s  Fall events will be consumed by the release  
-AnLVFt7mvA,108640,116080,"of the redesigned M2 mac mini, the M2 iPad  Pros and potentially even the new Mac Pro."
-AnLVFt7mvA,116080,119760,"So to me, it makes the most sense for  the new MacBook Pros to get revealed  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,119760,124320,in the Spring of next year because I  fully believe that Apple is switching  
-AnLVFt7mvA,124320,130000,to an 18-month or 1.5-year  timeline for Mac updates.
-AnLVFt7mvA,130000,135920,And I’m confident in this because Apple revealed  their M2 chip around 18 months after the  
-AnLVFt7mvA,135920,142400,"original M1 chip reveal in November of 2020, and  we already have many rumors from multiple sources  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,142400,147200,"that the M3 chip is gonna be  revealed at the end of 2023,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,147200,154560,"which will also be around 18 months after the  launch of the M2, hence an 18-month timeline."
-AnLVFt7mvA,154560,160800,"And as we know, the M1 Pro and M1 Max  chips were revealed in November of 2021,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,160800,165120,and 18 months after that lands  perfectly in the Spring of 2023.
-AnLVFt7mvA,165760,168400,"But moving to the actual chip side of things,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,168400,172079,"back in April, Mark reported  that there’s already evidence  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,172080,180880,"of Apple internally testing the new M2 Pro And Max  chips, with up to 12 CPU cores and 38 GPU cores."
-AnLVFt7mvA,181440,185040,And that actually confirms a  report from 9to5mac in March  
-AnLVFt7mvA,185040,191599,"claiming that Apple’s working on two Mac mini’s,  one with an M2 chip for launch later this year,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,191600,198880,"and another with an M2 Pro chip with a 12-core  CPU, exactly what Mark Gurman reported."
-AnLVFt7mvA,198880,203760,"But the biggest bombshell leak came from Jeff  Pu just a couple of weeks ago, claiming that  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,203760,212159,TSMC will be starting mass production  of new 3nm M2 Pro chips later this year.
-AnLVFt7mvA,212160,218080,"Yes, he actually said 3nm chips  in mass production THIS YEAR,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,218080,221920,which would be perfect for a Spring 2023 launch.
-AnLVFt7mvA,221920,227920,"And at first, I had trouble believing this because  the entire M1 family of chips was on the same  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,227920,234400,"1st-gen 5nm process node, so why in the world  would Apple build half of the M2 family of  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,234400,239439,"chips on a 3nm process, and half of them on  the 5nm process like the regular M2 chip."
-AnLVFt7mvA,239440,243920,"Well, I came up with four pretty  good reasons for Apple to do this."
-AnLVFt7mvA,243920,250240,"First of all, if the M2 Pro and Max chips are  based on the same 5nm node that the M2 chip  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,250240,255120,"is based on, then the performance might  be quite disappointing because the IPC  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,255120,262000,"improvements are pretty minimal on the M2, with  most of the gains coming from the extra GPU cores."
-AnLVFt7mvA,262000,267680,"And now for the second reason, TSMC’s  3nm technology is a major breakthrough  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,267680,273280,"as I’m gonna show you guys in just a minute,  which means that it’s also quite expensive..  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,273280,279600,"And the key point is that whenever a breakthrough  chip node gets released like the 3nm chip,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,279600,285760,the yields on those chips are pretty low since  the technology to make them is brand new.
-AnLVFt7mvA,285760,291520,So it actually makes the most sense to debut  a new process node on a product that doesn’t  
-AnLVFt7mvA,291520,297360,"sell in massive volumes, making a 3nm  launch perfect for Apple’s higher-end  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,297360,303439,"and expensive MacBook Pros, especially since  that’s the target market that actually cares  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,303440,308640,about having the highest performance  which a new 3nm process node would give!
-AnLVFt7mvA,308640,313200,"So because of that, I came up with a  very interesting theory. What if Apple  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,313200,321680,intentionally wanted to split up their M2 family  of chips between 5nm and 3nm-based process nodes?
-AnLVFt7mvA,321680,324160,"And why would they do this? Well, because  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,324160,329680,Apple knows that their lower-end Macs like  the M1 MacBook Air and base M1 MacBook pro  
-AnLVFt7mvA,329680,336400,"are the best-selling laptops in the world..  and if these chips were based on 3nm tech,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,336400,343600,they literally wouldn’t have enough yield left  over for their high-end M2 Pro and Max chips.
-AnLVFt7mvA,343600,349040,So by building their brand new basic M2  chip on the already existing and mature  
-AnLVFt7mvA,349040,355040,5nm process node from TSMC and giving it to all  of their high-volume low-end products like the  
-AnLVFt7mvA,355040,361440,"new M2 MacBook Air, the base MacBook Pro,  likely the upcoming Mac mini and the future  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,361440,367040,"iPad Pro and iPad AIr models, they would  be ensuring that their higher-end Macs  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,367760,375360,have as many brand new 3nm chips as they need  to account for the low initial yields… and then  
-AnLVFt7mvA,375360,383759,"later in 2023, they could finally bring 3nm to  the low-end Macs when the yields have improved."
-AnLVFt7mvA,383760,389440,"And from a design standpoint, Apple has always  started their chip designs with their iPhone chips  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,389440,394640,"and scaled them up to their larger iPad  chips, but now that the Apple Silicon  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,394640,400480,transition is about to complete.. What if  Apple switches to doing everything in reverse?
-AnLVFt7mvA,400480,406800,"What if they start their chip design with the  M2 Max die built on the brand new 3nm node,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,406800,411680,"and then they simply combine two of  these dies to create the M2 Ultra chip,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,411680,418160,or four of them to create the M2 Extreme  destined for the Mac Pro… while at the same  
-AnLVFt7mvA,418160,424560,time cutting the M2 Max in half to create the  M2 Pro chip just like they did with the M1 Pro?
-AnLVFt7mvA,424560,431840,"And then on the flip side, they can scale  the M2 Max down to create the new M3 chip,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,431840,435840,because I believe it’s much easier  to scale down than it is to scale up.
-AnLVFt7mvA,436400,440080,And then they can take those  same cores from the M2 Max  
-AnLVFt7mvA,440080,446639,and scale them down further for the new  A17 chip design going into the iPhone.
-AnLVFt7mvA,446640,453840,"So you basically have an entire array of  chips based entirely on the single M2 Max die,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,453840,458560,requiring the least amount of  R&D possible and saving cash.
-AnLVFt7mvA,458560,462240,"And if you’re not convinced yet,  that the M2 Pro and Max chips  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,462240,466720,"will be based on 3nm, here’s  the nail in the coffin."
-AnLVFt7mvA,466720,473440,If Apple’s chips are truly on a 1.5-year  timeline and Apple chose to go with 5nm again  
-AnLVFt7mvA,473440,479440,"for the M2 Pro and Max chips, then these  high-end chips wouldn’t be built on 3nm  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,479440,486400,"until the Fall of 2024 which is honestly  way too long, and I’ll prove it to you."
-AnLVFt7mvA,486400,494000,TSMC just had their Technology Symposium event for  2022 where they revealed their updated roadmap for  
-AnLVFt7mvA,494000,503200,"their chip nodes, and guess what, their brand  new 3nm N3 node is in their 2022 timeline,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,503200,510640,with TSMC confirming that N3 is on track to start  high volume manufacturing in the second half of  
-AnLVFt7mvA,510640,519120,"this year, with actual chips set to get delivered  to customers in early 2023, perfectly fitting  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,519120,526000,the 18-month timeline for when the M2 Pro  and M2 Max MacBook Pros should get released.
-AnLVFt7mvA,526000,528560,But wait.. They added a disclaimer…
-AnLVFt7mvA,528560,534800,“This technology is mostly aimed at early adopters  like Apple who can invest in leading-edge designs  
-AnLVFt7mvA,534800,541120,"and would benefit from the performance, power, and  area advantages offered by leading-edge nodes. “"
-AnLVFt7mvA,541120,547920,So why in the world would Apple NOT adopt 3nm for  their M2 Pro and M2 Max chips if 3nm is actually  
-AnLVFt7mvA,547920,553279,gonna be ready right on time for launch? Do you  really believe they would let their competitors  
-AnLVFt7mvA,553280,562480,adopt 3nm first while they wait another 18 months  until Late-2024 for the M3 Pro and Max chips?
-AnLVFt7mvA,562480,567279,"Well, I don’t, especially since there  are rumors that Intel is delaying  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,567280,573200,"their Meteor Lake chips until  the third or 4th quarter of 2023,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,573200,579600,the same chips that are supposed to partially  utilize TSMC’s new 3nm process node.
-AnLVFt7mvA,579600,583600,And that Intel delay means more 3nm chip yields  
-AnLVFt7mvA,583600,588560,for Apple’s M2 Pro And Max  chips coming in early 2023.
-AnLVFt7mvA,588560,591360,So hopefully all of that  was enough to convince you  
-AnLVFt7mvA,591360,597440,"that Apple’s new chips will be based on  3nm tech, but now let’s finish off with  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,597440,602640,why this is gonna be a MASSIVE deal  for those new high-end MacBook Pros.
-AnLVFt7mvA,602640,607920,"But first I wanna give a huge shoutout  to our brand new M2 cubed chip design,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,607920,610240,"that you can find in our merch shelf below,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,611040,618160,and make sure to use the coupon code  “M2CHIP” to save 20% on ALL of our merch.
-AnLVFt7mvA,618160,626879,"First of all, TSMC expects a 25-30% reduction  in power usage with 3nm compared to 5nm,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,626880,632560,"which is massive, allowing the chips to  run a lot cooler and save battery life."
-AnLVFt7mvA,632560,638000,"And on the flip side, they expect 10-15% more  performance, and that’s not even counting  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,638000,642320,"Apple’s own upgrades they can make  like redesigning the actual cores,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,642320,647840,"increasing caches, adding in faster  RAM, and adding in more cores."
-AnLVFt7mvA,647840,655120,"But by far, the biggest benefit is the brand  new N3 Finflex hybrid technology that TSMC  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,655120,660000,"just announced, which for the first  time ever, allows them to split their N3  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,660000,666240,"nodes into three different options, one  with 3-2 fins for maximum performance,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,666240,672399,"one with 2-2 fins for a good balance between  performance, power efficiency and density,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,672400,679360,and then a 2-1 fin for ultra power efficiency with  the lowest power consumption and highest density.
-AnLVFt7mvA,679360,685760,And the best part is that Apple will be able to  combine those three varieties of N3 onto the same  
-AnLVFt7mvA,685760,690800,"die for the first time ever, which could  drastically improve performance and efficiency  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,690800,697600,since the current N5 node is set to 2-fin across  the entire die with no fine-tuning allowed.
-AnLVFt7mvA,697600,701920,"So there you guys go, that’s why  I think the new M2 Pro and Max  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,701920,710880,"chips are gonna be based on TSMC’s 3nm  process, and if you disagree with me,  "
-AnLVFt7mvA,711520,714480,"let me know down in the comments  below, but if you enjoyed the video,  "
