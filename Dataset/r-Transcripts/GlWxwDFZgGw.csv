GlWxwDFZgGw,314320,320000,my travel bag apologies if you watched  my instagram stories because i literally  raved about the exact same products but
GlWxwDFZgGw,320000,326160,i just wanted to get the word out about  the discount because it's very much  appreciated with lms because that price
GlWxwDFZgGw,326160,332320,point is premium but you really do get  what you pay for and the aching muscle  super soak charlie's going to be
GlWxwDFZgGw,332320,339600,stealing this from me in about 10  minutes because he's just been into the  gym doing some stretching and some yoga  because he's quite sore from his
GlWxwDFZgGw,339600,345280,personal training sessions and i'm going  to take one of these with me in the car  um  i'm probably going to be in the car for
GlWxwDFZgGw,345280,350320,about an hour and a half today in total  um so this these are their pro collagen
GlWxwDFZgGw,350320,356160,hydrogel eye masks they are my absolute  favorite  i can't i don't know if the vlogs are in
GlWxwDFZgGw,356160,361919,the right order  i think the one you just saw  and the one before that were flipped
GlWxwDFZgGw,361919,369199,around but basically yesterday morning  was the morning that i woke up at 2 a.m  and i had these on for maybe from 3 a.m
GlWxwDFZgGw,369199,374319,till 4 a.m and they're so good for  instantly tightening brightening and
GlWxwDFZgGw,374319,380400,hydrating the under eye area they make  such visible difference with things like  that they do feel like such a luxury
GlWxwDFZgGw,380400,386160,it's one of those things where i'm like  is it really worth it but then when i  put those ones on
GlWxwDFZgGw,386160,391680,i can see the difference and i've said a  million times my eye area is the area  that i have the most
GlWxwDFZgGw,391680,398160,concern yeah i love them i'm going to be  taking my mist with me today because  it's going to be hot and we're going to
GlWxwDFZgGw,398160,403440,be outside a lot today i will be outside  most of the day today but it is so so
GlWxwDFZgGw,403440,410240,important to have spf 50 on your face  every day whether you're gonna be  outside or not i have got quite a lot on
GlWxwDFZgGw,410240,415440,here but i definitely think i nude it  right now i do always take my spf 50
GlWxwDFZgGw,415440,421440,down my neck as well sometimes i cut it  from what i'm showing in the videos  because i probably pull like the  weirdest
GlWxwDFZgGw,421440,426479,faces and you just  you don't need to see that and then the  final thing that i'm going to pop on my
GlWxwDFZgGw,426479,431599,face before applying a very very light  makeup for today is the elements
GlWxwDFZgGw,431599,437280,superfood glow priming moisturizer so  you can apply just this you could apply
GlWxwDFZgGw,437280,442720,this before your spf um in place of your  moisturizer
GlWxwDFZgGw,442720,449680,i love it as a makeup base because  you'll see now it just gives the most  heavenly glow to the complexion it's got
GlWxwDFZgGw,449680,455039,fermented ginger within the formula so  as well as it having its own kind of
GlWxwDFZgGw,455039,460240,shimmer it's almost like a pearlescent  formula  the ingredients within it also work to
GlWxwDFZgGw,460240,467120,brighten the skin so you're getting a  double whammy of brightening and i feel  like in summer  even on no makeup days just by popping
GlWxwDFZgGw,467120,472720,this on the skin  gives you the most heavenly glow but i  love it under makeup and it just leaves
GlWxwDFZgGw,472720,479599,my skin looking radiant and glowing like  golden hour glow  all day so hopefully you can see i can
GlWxwDFZgGw,479599,487120,never tell what shows up well on camera  and what i'm just seeing in the mirror  but hopefully you can see that's given  my skin a beautiful
GlWxwDFZgGw,487120,493039,very natural glow and that will really  show through my makeup i had it on  yesterday as well um because i did pop a
GlWxwDFZgGw,493039,499199,little bit of makeup on to do an  instagram live and you really do and you  really do get that glow through your
GlWxwDFZgGw,499199,504479,makeup so while those  three layers of moisturization that sink
GlWxwDFZgGw,504479,511759,into my skin i'm going to blow dry my  hair  and i will catch up with you when that  is done okay hair and makeup done i've
GlWxwDFZgGw,511759,517760,gone for some  really big curls hopefully they will  last and not melt like no doubt the rest
GlWxwDFZgGw,517760,522959,of me will  i've decided to go with this beautiful  lukewarm secret dress that i've had for
GlWxwDFZgGw,522959,530160,a couple of years because then i can  make it off shoulder and catch the sun  on my chest and a decollete area i think
GlWxwDFZgGw,530160,538080,we're going to be look charlie still has  not packed from barcelona so unorganized  i've popped on my rattam um valentino
GlWxwDFZgGw,538080,545279,rocksteads as always because i think we  might be doing a little bit of marching  across a kitchen garden for our event
GlWxwDFZgGw,545279,550800,later on today i realize i have not even  told you where i am going today but
GlWxwDFZgGw,550800,556560,after i get my nails done with hayley  i'm driving down
GlWxwDFZgGw,556560,562880,or across  to time because today they are launching  when i first read the email i thought it
GlWxwDFZgGw,562880,568800,said veg patch launch which i was  obviously very excited about i love a  veg patch launch and i thought i should
GlWxwDFZgGw,568800,576880,have hosted a veg patch launch at my  house maybe i still will um but actually  it said veg patch linen launch so you
GlWxwDFZgGw,576880,585040,may know that my favorite um  [Music]  table linen is my gorgeous butter
GlWxwDFZgGw,586399,591600,is my gorgeous buttercup linen from time  um and today they are launching a new
GlWxwDFZgGw,591600,597519,collection  and the owner of time karen she actually  sketches the beautiful designs on the
GlWxwDFZgGw,597519,603360,linens and it's got radishes it's got i  think broccoli sweet peas all patterns
GlWxwDFZgGw,603360,609440,and sketches based on their kitchen  garden or their veg patch so really  excited to head there but first i'm
GlWxwDFZgGw,609440,618560,going to see haley  to get my nails done person is insane  okay i have made it to time just in time
GlWxwDFZgGw,618560,624720,those puns will never get old and i have  gone for just a very classic uh this is  actually just a couple of layers of the
GlWxwDFZgGw,624720,630720,builder gel which really helps to  strengthen your nails so as always going  to be taking a lot of inspiration from
GlWxwDFZgGw,630720,638160,the gardens here i think this is  actually a little asparagus oh no or is  it a fennel  i'm not sure but we've been admiring the
GlWxwDFZgGw,638160,644000,tiny little baby olives coming through  let me see if i can find any i can't say  i've ever seen a baby olive before
GlWxwDFZgGw,644000,650480,you can see them dangling there and they  should be ripe and ready by september
GlWxwDFZgGw,655279,661120,here's the ingredients for our lunch  ready to go on the fire pit and this is  where we're going to be having lunch
GlWxwDFZgGw,661120,667200,this is  a beautiful new table linen from time  we've got some color mirrors some chard
GlWxwDFZgGw,667200,672959,on the table  we're taking a little stroll around the  kitchen garden and i've just spotted
GlWxwDFZgGw,672959,678800,their cardoons which are so ginormous  and it's made me realize i definitely  need to move mine
GlWxwDFZgGw,678800,684340,in the middle of my veg bed because they  will absolutely take over
GlWxwDFZgGw,684340,697040,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,697040,702640,every time i come into a kitchen garden  i always ask so many questions and i'd  actually never seen pumpkins grown on
GlWxwDFZgGw,702640,708399,mounds before but apparently this is the  way to do it i guess it's something to  do with the flow of water or keeping the
GlWxwDFZgGw,708399,714320,nutrients in one place  but these are about the same size as my  pumpkins but maybe i need to do them in
GlWxwDFZgGw,714320,720800,mounds next year maybe one year i'll  turn the entire  of the  wildflower meadow into a pumpkin patch
GlWxwDFZgGw,720800,740079,i'm not sure charlie would approve of  that idea  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,740079,746800,so after a delicious lunch we're making  our way through the water meadows and if  you look down here this is the water
GlWxwDFZgGw,746800,752000,mint  and the smell of it  is exactly the same as the bertioli
GlWxwDFZgGw,752000,758399,products the lovely breathing balm the  hand wash  the body balm  such a lovely fragrance i think we're
GlWxwDFZgGw,758399,764560,heading back towards  time  everyone in their beautiful dresses and  lettuce the sausage dog
GlWxwDFZgGw,764560,781760,bringing it up the rear  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,785200,790240,well this really is the most magical  experience we are slowly wandering
GlWxwDFZgGw,790240,796240,through the water meadows here at time  this is behind me the house where the
GlWxwDFZgGw,796240,801279,owners of time live and we're strolling  through their meadowland looking at all  the different flowers that are growing
GlWxwDFZgGw,801279,807440,here from wild orchid wild wild pea  which i didn't even know is a thing
GlWxwDFZgGw,807440,813040,and then also in here we've learned  about yellow rattle which apparently for  farmers in africa is an absolute
GlWxwDFZgGw,813040,819360,nightmare because it reduces the yield  of a field however here in a  in a meadow it's perfect because it
GlWxwDFZgGw,819360,828440,actually stops the grass from growing  back quite so much and allowing more  room for different diverse species
GlWxwDFZgGw,830940,836399,[Music]  just when i thought this day couldn't  get any more perfect we've been invited
GlWxwDFZgGw,836399,843519,to have a coffee on  the new terrace at the house at karen's  house and it is the perfect spot i'm
GlWxwDFZgGw,843519,850720,gonna have to show you this beautiful  garden area we've got this gorgeous big  herbaceous border with alliums lots of
GlWxwDFZgGw,850720,855839,the daisies oxidase i can see some  catmint down there so beautiful and if i
GlWxwDFZgGw,855839,862240,spin you around this little walled area  church oh my gosh this is just the  absolute dream looks like a provincial
GlWxwDFZgGw,862240,868720,style house but it's so so  elegant and beautiful the old tiled roof
GlWxwDFZgGw,868720,876399,and then this terrace has been  finished only a couple of weeks ago  these beautiful boxes
GlWxwDFZgGw,876560,882800,with the blooms hanging down look at  this entrance way  oh my gosh
GlWxwDFZgGw,882800,893920,vines growing up the house  these poppies over here  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,893920,900639,finishing the day in the barn and this  is their new exhibition by an artist  called kate friend each of these flowers
GlWxwDFZgGw,900639,907440,represents a portrait and they've also  collaborated with the antiques business  called lawford's user lawful
GlWxwDFZgGw,907440,912480,sofas and they've covered them in the  thyme fabric they look so beautiful
GlWxwDFZgGw,912480,918000,and for our party bags we're taking  little bags of stuff
GlWxwDFZgGw,918000,923920,of course i can't come to time without a  little trip to the store boutique we've  got some beautiful new pieces since i
GlWxwDFZgGw,923920,929519,was last here  some gorgeous books  so many new ceramics

GlWxwDFZgGw,935839,940880,was wearing this morning popping my  makeup on  so many gorgeous designs of course we
GlWxwDFZgGw,940880,947839,can stock up on the bertioli hand and  body lotion and hand wash that we now  have throughout the house it is the best
GlWxwDFZgGw,947839,953279,smelling  body lotion and hand wash in the world  and of course the candles
GlWxwDFZgGw,953279,959600,my favorite  so this is the full table linen  collection let's see the buttercup one
GlWxwDFZgGw,959600,965519,over there is one that i have got  already at home then we've got the corn  flour  poppy
GlWxwDFZgGw,965519,971920,the runner beans which other ones are  there broad beans  so beautiful and then all the rattan

GlWxwDFZgGw,983600,990160,it was time to go and gosh just the most  magical afternoon i cannot think of a  better way of spending the afternoon it
GlWxwDFZgGw,990160,997680,was so lovely such a great group oh my  gosh we're gonna have some accompaniment  in a second by the looks of it um
GlWxwDFZgGw,997680,1003519,really lovely group of ladies for the  launch of veg patch table linen designed
GlWxwDFZgGw,1003519,1008959,and drawn by karen who joins us for the  lunch and her lovely daughter millie  both of whom are just so inspirational
GlWxwDFZgGw,1008959,1014959,the business that they have built that  time is so incredible whenever i go  there i pick up so much inspiration
GlWxwDFZgGw,1014959,1020000,whether it's food inspiration or  interior design or garden and it truly
GlWxwDFZgGw,1020000,1025520,was a wonderful way to spend the  afternoon  we were invited to stay over and have
GlWxwDFZgGw,1025520,1031918,dinner as well but we have got a very  early start in the morning so sadly  we'll have to do that another time but
GlWxwDFZgGw,1031918,1037600,i'm on my way home now and i always keep  my secateurs and my gloves in the car so
GlWxwDFZgGw,1037600,1043520,that i can do a little bit of wildflower  picking and unfortunately it is due to  rain over the next couple of days and a
GlWxwDFZgGw,1043520,1049039,lot of these flowers may flop over and  not look quite so good after the rain so  i thought i would come out this
GlWxwDFZgGw,1049039,1054640,afternoon if you do want to do this as  well i would highly recommend gloves  because you can never without the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1054640,1060559,picture this up you can never be 100  sure um what you are picking and there  is actually a variety of plant which
GlWxwDFZgGw,1060559,1068240,looks quite similar to this called  hogweed and for some people if you get  hogwart hog weed on your skin and then
GlWxwDFZgGw,1068240,1074480,you expose that skin to the sun it can  cause awful blisters so just always be  careful always make sure you know
GlWxwDFZgGw,1074480,1079600,definitely always make sure you're 100  sure that what you're picking is um
GlWxwDFZgGw,1079600,1086240,not going to sting you  lots of you also asked to see the  outside of my car as well i realized i
GlWxwDFZgGw,1086240,1092720,didn't actually show you i only showed  you the interior um well here it is it's  this beautiful deep brown color the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1092720,1097919,color is actually called truffle  you may remember that i always dreamt of
GlWxwDFZgGw,1097919,1104559,getting a dark green car with tan  interiors um i designed my i should have  shown you with all the doors shouldn't i
GlWxwDFZgGw,1104559,1110320,i designed my dream car in those colors  but then when i saw this i thought  that's really different
GlWxwDFZgGw,1110320,1116720,and very elegant and very timeless and  also i really particularly wanted a  porsche cayenne and i think it really
GlWxwDFZgGw,1116720,1122000,suits this color so  i'm so so pleased with my choice what
GlWxwDFZgGw,1122000,1126360,beautiful driveway this person has
GlWxwDFZgGw,1142559,1149039,okay back home again it is so warm up  here and i think i have very much picked  up a little bit of the sun today my
GlWxwDFZgGw,1149039,1155120,chest area looks a little bit sunkissed  have arrived home to a few deliveries  which i'm very excited to get into i'm
GlWxwDFZgGw,1155120,1161520,hoping there might be a net reporter  order somewhere as well because tomorrow  we have to leave home really early we're
GlWxwDFZgGw,1161520,1168880,going to be in windsor for the day um  and then we're staying the night at  charlie's mom and dad's house and then  the next day we are going into goodwood
GlWxwDFZgGw,1168880,1175280,and one of the outfits that i was hoping  to wear to goodwood is in that nest  fortress box so hopefully it might be
GlWxwDFZgGw,1175280,1181039,here um but i've also received some  goodies from a brand called alexandra  miro
GlWxwDFZgGw,1181039,1186799,i have followed this brand on instagram  for so long and they do the most  gorgeous swimsuits in the most fun
GlWxwDFZgGw,1186799,1192320,colors i just thought this was  absolutely gorgeous it's a little bit
GlWxwDFZgGw,1192320,1197600,60s pinup kind of style it's going to  look really fun really retro and i  believe
GlWxwDFZgGw,1197600,1203679,this is the matching little  not so little maxi skirt so how fabulous
GlWxwDFZgGw,1203679,1209679,that's going to look as an outfit  together the swimsuit and then this  little high-waisted skirt as well really
GlWxwDFZgGw,1209679,1215840,beautiful materials  feels like cotton but  it can't be surely it feels like the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1215840,1222480,kind of material that will dry really  quickly so i can imagine wearing this on  a boat day on the greek islands oh my
GlWxwDFZgGw,1222480,1227760,gosh  days like today made me very excited for
GlWxwDFZgGw,1227760,1232799,a summer holiday even though we just got  back from barcelona
GlWxwDFZgGw,1233039,1239200,and then a couple of pieces from holland  cooper arrived these kind of items are  really good when i know we're skipping
GlWxwDFZgGw,1239200,1245919,ahead a little bit now but when you  start to want to bring some slightly  more autumnal fabrics into your wardrobe
GlWxwDFZgGw,1245919,1251120,and yet it's still summer so this is a  knitted v-neck kind of like a tank top i
GlWxwDFZgGw,1251120,1256799,feel like this is going to be a really  good building block versatile piece in  my wardrobe i could potentially try
GlWxwDFZgGw,1256799,1264320,wearing this with jeans although  realistically i'll probably end up  wearing this with my brown leggings but  i think with a with a chunky brown belt
GlWxwDFZgGw,1264320,1270880,one of my luffy belts or even denim  shorts  that could look really cool and then  this won't look quite so fabulous until
GlWxwDFZgGw,1270880,1277760,it's steamed um but i saw this on the  website and it is a ruffle  necked blouse with these little fluted
GlWxwDFZgGw,1277760,1283760,ruffle details on the sleeves again i  can't even think about wearing something  long-sleeved right now um but when the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1283760,1290320,temperatures do cool down i will try  that on for you and now this next  delivery is really random i'm really
GlWxwDFZgGw,1290320,1297520,intrigued by this  it's from a brand called zuvi  and it's a hairdryer
GlWxwDFZgGw,1297520,1302880,that looks remarkably similar to the  dyson  um
GlWxwDFZgGw,1302880,1309280,supersonic which i'm a huge fan of and  use every single day  i don't know whether i should say that
GlWxwDFZgGw,1309280,1316000,this is a dupe  either way i'm going to try this out um  probably tomorrow evening
GlWxwDFZgGw,1316000,1321919,it's when i'll next wash my hair so i'll  take this with me to charisma and dad's  house and i'll try it and then i'll be
GlWxwDFZgGw,1321919,1328000,able to really compare this to the dyson  supersonic because i'm very very  familiar with the supersonic so
GlWxwDFZgGw,1328000,1333760,yes i will  nature nature inspired light care  technology
GlWxwDFZgGw,1333760,1339280,and like hair dryers that use extreme  heat xuvi halo quickly dries the water  on the surface of your hair leaving the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1339280,1344880,inside cortex hydrated and healthier  lower temperatures with a fast drying  speed
GlWxwDFZgGw,1344880,1351919,that sounds incredible  i'm intrigued i'm intrigued so i'll give  you  a very honest review and comparison of
GlWxwDFZgGw,1351919,1358159,how this compares to the dyson because i  feel like that's what everyone is going  to be thinking when they see a hairdryer
GlWxwDFZgGw,1358159,1364080,and that looks like this anyway chai is  about to start making dinner and i can't  wait to see how our outdoor table looks
GlWxwDFZgGw,1364080,1370080,with the new time um table linen i also  picked up uh another bertioli candle
GlWxwDFZgGw,1370080,1375440,from the boutique because they just  smell absolutely incredible so i'm gonna  lay the table even though it's just the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1375440,1380799,two of us  and um  do my flower arranging
GlWxwDFZgGw,1380799,1387440,gosh what a magical evening it has  turned into it went a little bit  overcast for an hour or so but now it's
GlWxwDFZgGw,1387440,1393679,cleared up  and the sun is shining beautifully it is  church bell practice this evening so
GlWxwDFZgGw,1393679,1399679,we'll have a little bit of a background  track but of course i would like to  share with you my loot and my loot from
GlWxwDFZgGw,1399679,1406559,time first of all though i need to open  up these vegetables um which have come  straight from the thyme kitchen garden
GlWxwDFZgGw,1406559,1411679,because charlie is cooking dinner and  he's going to do something wonderful  with these so let's take a look i'm
GlWxwDFZgGw,1411679,1418080,going to remove this beautiful new  tablecloth which i'll show in a second  out the way so we have got this looks
GlWxwDFZgGw,1418080,1424880,like giant spinach leaves could be  or a different type of um lettuce leaf
GlWxwDFZgGw,1424880,1431279,oh my gosh  this is fantastic  a giant bunch of radishes i think mine
GlWxwDFZgGw,1431279,1437200,are probably a similar size to this now  but i didn't grow the long type yet this
GlWxwDFZgGw,1437200,1443120,year although i did plant some seeds of  this kind yesterday so they shouldn't be  too long radishes are great for super
GlWxwDFZgGw,1443120,1449120,quick germination then we have got a  kohlrabi and actually before today i
GlWxwDFZgGw,1449120,1455919,wouldn't have known what to do with this  but i was sat next to a lovely lady  called georgie and i'm going to link her  cookbook down below because it sounded
GlWxwDFZgGw,1455919,1461120,incredible  and she was telling me various ways of  eating a kohlrabi the simplest is
GlWxwDFZgGw,1461120,1468480,basically to treat it the same way as a  radish so thinly sliced in a salad is  absolutely perfect
GlWxwDFZgGw,1468480,1475039,and then i believe  it's not a bag of sweeties even more  exciting it is a bag
GlWxwDFZgGw,1475039,1481120,of potatoes pulled from the ground this  very morning so i'm going to take these  into the kitchen and charlie will work
GlWxwDFZgGw,1481120,1488240,his magic  so now it's time to unbox my wonderful  goodie bag from time i believe we have a
GlWxwDFZgGw,1488240,1493760,set of the napkins from the new range in  here which i'm going to use to lay the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1493760,1499039,table i will show you everything once  it's all set out so i'm going to pop you  on a little time lapse to enjoy the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1499039,1524080,church bells while i get the table ready  for dinner  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1524080,1530320,so  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1530320,1535679,from setting a kitchen garden themed  table to heading down to my own kitchen  garden
GlWxwDFZgGw,1535679,1544159,i'm going to just collect a few salad  leaves i think we're having a kind of  stir fry but i think everything
GlWxwDFZgGw,1544159,1550720,is wonderful with a light salad at this  time of year  my red oak lettuce is most definitely
GlWxwDFZgGw,1550720,1557919,the one which has done the best i grew  all of this from seed you might remember  back in was it march or april
GlWxwDFZgGw,1557919,1561799,it's just so plentiful
GlWxwDFZgGw,1578559,1583600,so here we go the table is laid and i've  just been down to get some salad leaves
GlWxwDFZgGw,1583600,1589440,and i've added oh i've added the radish  from my goodie bag more as a decoration  because i'm not sure we're going to need
GlWxwDFZgGw,1589440,1595039,it in tonight's dinner but that's fine  these will be perfect in a salad  tomorrow so now you can see the full
GlWxwDFZgGw,1595039,1601520,beauty of the table linen the veggies on  here hand painted by karen and we've got
GlWxwDFZgGw,1601520,1608480,radishes we've got onions and we've got  carrots karen said that the carrot was  the first thing that she that she drew
GlWxwDFZgGw,1608480,1614480,and then for the napkins we've got  onions radish  carrot again and then this one here that
GlWxwDFZgGw,1614480,1621120,i've not used because we're only three  for dinner tonight is the runner beans  they used veggies as a decoration on the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1621120,1627600,table as you saw earlier um not sure  that looks quite as beautiful  as theirs did in a terracotta pot but
GlWxwDFZgGw,1627600,1633279,there we go side note i noticed this  morning when i did my order that these  are currently half price on ocado they
GlWxwDFZgGw,1633279,1639440,are from dale's food and they're half  price at the moment and i think these  were like 15 off so i'll leave them  linked down below
GlWxwDFZgGw,1639440,1645919,just some blooms from the garden and the  great thing about these napkins the way  they've been designed is that they're
GlWxwDFZgGw,1645919,1652159,the right size and direction so that if  you choose to tie them like this or with  string then it kind of looks like you're
GlWxwDFZgGw,1652159,1657600,tying together the veggies it's most um  apparent with the carrots i think this
GlWxwDFZgGw,1657600,1663679,is probably my favorite one but it looks  absolutely beautiful very much suits our  surroundings
GlWxwDFZgGw,1663679,1669840,perfect setting for our dinner and then  i've also popped  the big and the small single wick and
GlWxwDFZgGw,1669840,1676640,double wick bertioli candle down here  just for a little bit of decoration i  just opened up a couple more deliveries
GlWxwDFZgGw,1676640,1684880,and both of them have wine inside which  is wonderful news they also served a  glass of the new time rose
GlWxwDFZgGw,1684880,1689919,at lunch today and apparently the  vineyard is right next to the whispering  angel vineyard and i have to say it
GlWxwDFZgGw,1689919,1696240,tasted very similar so i'll most  definitely be seeing if i can purchase  some thyme rose because how lovely and
GlWxwDFZgGw,1696240,1703360,as you can imagine the bottle was  beautiful  so this delivery has arrived from  penguin which is um the book publisher
GlWxwDFZgGw,1703360,1709760,this is a book called summer fever two  couples one dark secret  my goodness sounds like a perfect
GlWxwDFZgGw,1709760,1717250,holiday read and it arrived with  some della vita prosecco rose
GlWxwDFZgGw,1717250,1727960,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1730270,1738150,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1739360,1746320,hello again darlings so after a day in  the sunshine i'm going to be using the  elemis pro collagen rose cleansing balm
GlWxwDFZgGw,1746320,1751600,as my double cleanse for this evening  as always i have used my
GlWxwDFZgGw,1751600,1758240,what do you may call it my face halo for  the first cleanse to get all the makeup  off my skin i'm taking a good dollop now
GlWxwDFZgGw,1758240,1764240,the rose is especially good after a  summer's day because the rose itself is
GlWxwDFZgGw,1764240,1769440,really calming if i've been in the air  con a lot or if i've been outside and
GlWxwDFZgGw,1769440,1775200,i've had a bit of sun on my face even  though you've got fact 50 on it is still  quite stressful for your skin so the
GlWxwDFZgGw,1775200,1780240,rose is very calming  you can leave this on for a 10 minute
GlWxwDFZgGw,1780240,1786880,nourishing mask which is really nice to  do it just acts as a lovely hydrating  mask calming the skin giving you that
GlWxwDFZgGw,1786880,1795440,lovely glow i like to put whatever's  left on the back of my hands um and then  when i've taken that off i will pop on
GlWxwDFZgGw,1795440,1800480,my skin and me then i'll give my skin  about 10 minutes and then
GlWxwDFZgGw,1800480,1807039,i was going to open my new  ultra smart pro collagen however
GlWxwDFZgGw,1807440,1814080,i've realized oh this is actually the  day cream that this is what charlie's  been using as his night cream did you
GlWxwDFZgGw,1814080,1820320,realize you've been using the day cream  as your night cream yeah  intentionally not yeah so that is my

GlWxwDFZgGw,1878159,1883840,but we've made it to goodwood we're here  for the festival of speed so as you may  be able to hear from the engine noise in
GlWxwDFZgGw,1883840,1889279,the background which luckily we don't  have too much of right now um there's  races going on today we've just been
GlWxwDFZgGw,1889279,1895120,having a look at some old classic cars  some vintage cars  and also some very modern cars there are
GlWxwDFZgGw,1895120,1901679,some bmw concept vehicles here some  very interesting  rolls-royce vehicles but we're just
GlWxwDFZgGw,1901679,1907519,having a little wonder around we were  invited here today by  um i'll tell you all about that a little
GlWxwDFZgGw,1907519,1913919,bit later we're just heading over there  now to have breakfast with the sky team  and then we have got some very fun
GlWxwDFZgGw,1913919,1920679,things lined up for the day  i love this one
GlWxwDFZgGw,1921250,1927039,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1927039,1934799,i have to say i've never really lusted  over ferraris before which probably  sounds like the most ridiculous thing to  say but this one oh my goodness look at
GlWxwDFZgGw,1934799,1941640,this interior i think charlie's found  his dream looks like an aston martin
GlWxwDFZgGw,1942560,1946410,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1948480,1954640,if i can find the photo i will pop it on  the screen here but my dad's family used  to have a car like this we've got a
GlWxwDFZgGw,1954640,1959919,photo with fear written on the side  which is pretty cool
GlWxwDFZgGw,1959919,1966799,so this is the area where all the  vintage cars are my goodness it's tiny
GlWxwDFZgGw,1966799,1973120,oh my gosh  such unusual vehicles  this is an area where we can see some
GlWxwDFZgGw,1973120,1978720,new technology in the vehicles bmw  always have some really interesting  concept cars
GlWxwDFZgGw,1978720,1984490,let's have a look around  wow  reserved
GlWxwDFZgGw,1984490,1999970,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,1999970,2015120,[Applause]  [Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,2015120,2020580,food  so
GlWxwDFZgGw,2020580,2035819,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,2040670,2047360,[Music]
GlWxwDFZgGw,2047360,2054158,i feel like i've been rather rubbish at  vlogging today partly because it is so  loud outside by the racetrack and also
GlWxwDFZgGw,2054158,2059679,very very breezy but um as we are here  with sky very fortunately were actually
GlWxwDFZgGw,2059679,2066320,allowed into goodwood house also got  access to this incredible balcony which  has got the most amazing view
GlWxwDFZgGw,2066320,2073760,of the race track i don't believe  there's a race going on right at this  very second but  this is the parade circle had a lovely
GlWxwDFZgGw,2073760,2078800,lunch and we're now in this incredible  area so this is for sky vips which is
GlWxwDFZgGw,2078800,2084960,literally everyone if you have skye you  can download the my sky app  and you can win tickets to these events
GlWxwDFZgGw,2084960,2091760,or upgrades if you've already got  tickets and i believe we have got the  most insane view
GlWxwDFZgGw,2091760,2099078,oh my gosh  of the race track you can see they've  been doing some donuts down there
GlWxwDFZgGw,2104720,2110880,up on the sky balcony which is very epic  it's very noisy close to the action
GlWxwDFZgGw,2110880,2117359,we've got a great view of the racetrack  and some of the guys from the sky here  are doing a competition
GlWxwDFZgGw,2117359,2124320,where you have to name as many car makes  as you can in 60 seconds so we thought  we'd give it a go the previous record
GlWxwDFZgGw,2124320,2130720,before us was 26  in 60 seconds which is still  very good but what did we get darling we
GlWxwDFZgGw,2130720,2137440,got 34. i think we did well as a team we  did we had a quick discussion of the  tactics before we started you went cheap
GlWxwDFZgGw,2137440,2142640,i went expensive we alternated but then  you threw in bmw mercedes well it
GlWxwDFZgGw,2142640,2144960,depends
GlWxwDFZgGw,2156079,2161280,i can't believe we said master at the  end yeah master of the year  what we should really have done is
GlWxwDFZgGw,2161280,2166720,focused on europeans we should have an  asian alphabet no we shouldn't european  and asian it's all the asian brands and
GlWxwDFZgGw,2166720,2173280,the european brands a few american  brands and then you're done yeah anyways
GlWxwDFZgGw,2176240,2181599,good morning my darlings it is now the  next day coming at you fresh-faced and
GlWxwDFZgGw,2181599,2186800,reasonably fresh out of the shower i  didn't want to end the vlog um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2186800,2191839,just at the races yesterday because i  hate when i promise that i'm gonna talk
GlWxwDFZgGw,2191839,2199280,about something in a vlog and then i  don't deliver and i realized um that i  did say that i was gonna talk about the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2199280,2204640,zoo v is that correct zuvi zuba  envy
GlWxwDFZgGw,2204640,2211040,zooby zoovy halo hairdryer i did dangle  that carrot  or as charlie said or as charlie says
GlWxwDFZgGw,2211040,2217839,dangle that cabbage honestly we're such  dogs any expression we will just change  it slightly so it's not by the skin of
GlWxwDFZgGw,2217839,2223920,my teeth it'll be by the skin of my ears  and so i dangled the cabbage earlier  about talking about the zoobee hairdryer
GlWxwDFZgGw,2223920,2231920,um  and i have not yet even though i've used  it twice so i'm gonna fill you in on my
GlWxwDFZgGw,2231920,2237920,truly honest thoughts about that and  what everyone wants to know comparing it  to the dyson hairdryer which obviously i
GlWxwDFZgGw,2237920,2243119,have been a huge fan of and using  literally since it came out i worked um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2243119,2249119,i had a loan of the dyson supersonic  hair dryer just when it was about to be  released i was borrowing it from them to
GlWxwDFZgGw,2249119,2254320,shoot some content and then i loved it  so much i ended up buying it  um and i've been using it pretty much
GlWxwDFZgGw,2254320,2259760,ever since but before i go into that  debrief on yesterday the most fantastic
GlWxwDFZgGw,2259760,2266640,day at goodwood we're invited down by  sky to  i guess um raise awareness about the sky
GlWxwDFZgGw,2266640,2272880,vip  program not program um offering  sky not sponsoring this video they have
GlWxwDFZgGw,2272880,2277920,not asked me to say any of this but it's  so good and i feel like so not known
GlWxwDFZgGw,2277920,2284320,about that i'm going to tell you about  it anyway so if you're a sky customer or  thinking about being a sky customer you
GlWxwDFZgGw,2284320,2290800,definitely need to listen to this so  basically sky this is the strap line  with sky everyone is a vip and it's
GlWxwDFZgGw,2290800,2296000,actually true so  if you have a sky count um and if this
GlWxwDFZgGw,2296000,2302320,doesn't make you want to sign up to sky  then i don't know what will and what you  want to do is download this one here the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2302320,2307359,my sky app which is different to sky  goes sky goes when you can watch and
GlWxwDFZgGw,2307359,2313359,download your programs  my sky is more of like your kind of  admin hub it's more about your account
GlWxwDFZgGw,2313359,2319760,but  when you go on the my sky app you can go  to the sky vip area and sign up to that
GlWxwDFZgGw,2319760,2326800,it's free  every sky customer can have access to  this sky vip section reminder and this
GlWxwDFZgGw,2326800,2332800,is not sponsored it's just amazing and  i'm like why doesn't everyone know about  this um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2332800,2338960,and within this sky vip section you can  enter competitions you can win prizes
GlWxwDFZgGw,2338960,2345280,they i think it was last year they gave  away over two million prizes which is  insane when we were up on the balcony
GlWxwDFZgGw,2345280,2352000,area yesterday they so kindly allowed us  to take a few photos um when it was  empty before it was properly opened up
GlWxwDFZgGw,2352000,2359599,and then loads of sky customers had won  um either upgrades or tickets to  goodwood and had access to the best
GlWxwDFZgGw,2359599,2366079,balcony area um right by the start line  of the races and they hadn't paid  anything for that so that was just one
GlWxwDFZgGw,2366079,2372160,of the things that people had won um  on the app i feel like it's so  undiscovered that you've probably got a
GlWxwDFZgGw,2372160,2378000,really high chance of actually winning  stuff i know some friends that um got  tickets to billy eilish through the my

GlWxwDFZgGw,2439920,2446319,things concerts physical things probably  like massage experiences i don't know i  need to investigate it further so that
GlWxwDFZgGw,2446319,2451440,was a fantastic day um we then drove  back to windsor where charlie's mum and
GlWxwDFZgGw,2451440,2457839,dad live  and  i okay so i actually can't remember what  what i've told you at this point and
GlWxwDFZgGw,2457839,2464720,what i haven't told you yet because  basically my my mum has been in hospital  this week for a um a knee operation she
GlWxwDFZgGw,2464720,2472319,won't mind me telling you she had a half  knee replacement a robotic um surgery so  she's been in hospital for a few days um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2472319,2478319,and also a  i'm not going to share too much  information but a very close member of  charlie's family has now been in
GlWxwDFZgGw,2478319,2483680,hospital um for just over a week  so we our minds have been elsewhere we
GlWxwDFZgGw,2483680,2490240,have like physically been back and forth  to windsor to home and um basically my  vlogs have been slightly all over the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2490240,2496640,place in fact the end of the vlog that  you guys might have watched on sunday  i'm about to film that because i know
GlWxwDFZgGw,2496640,2502400,that i haven't actually finished filming  that vlog so i'm just kind of cobbling  together  different bits from different days so i
GlWxwDFZgGw,2502400,2508400,apologize if this like two week period  the vlogs are all really hectic
GlWxwDFZgGw,2508400,2514400,um  but yeah basically we've been here there  and everywhere so yesterday we
GlWxwDFZgGw,2514400,2521520,drove back from chichester to windsor um  to charlie's mom's viv charlie's mum had  so kindly picked up my mum from hospital
GlWxwDFZgGw,2521520,2527440,because she was discharged while we were  at goodwood and then we very carefully  and slowly drove my mum back
GlWxwDFZgGw,2527440,2533200,so she's home with us we're looking  after her here now and so she's got  um a tough week ahead of her
GlWxwDFZgGw,2533200,2540000,recovery-wise but we're gonna obviously  take the best care of her that we  possibly can do so yeah i apologize if i
GlWxwDFZgGw,2540000,2546880,apologize for the higgledy piggledy nuts  and um probably slightly aloofness of  these vlogs but now you know now you
GlWxwDFZgGw,2546880,2552400,know you know what you need to know  anyway let's end this vlog with a a very
GlWxwDFZgGw,2552400,2559440,honest unbiased chat about the zuvi so  zuvi for full clarity did send me this
GlWxwDFZgGw,2559440,2566240,device but  i will not let that impact my review in  the slightest because you know i feel
GlWxwDFZgGw,2566240,2572640,that with the  good fortune that i have to be sent  these products very often from lots of
GlWxwDFZgGw,2572640,2579280,different brands comes the  responsibility to share honest feedback  with you guys um even if they paid me a
GlWxwDFZgGw,2579280,2585839,million pounds and it was a rubbish  product i'd still tell you as a rubbish  product um i actually don't think it's  rubbish spoiler alert
GlWxwDFZgGw,2585839,2591520,but what i am going to do because i feel  like it's the question on everyone's  minds and i washed my hair about an hour
GlWxwDFZgGw,2591520,2598319,ago and it's air drying really quickly  because i use the red ken  one united spray and i'm a hardcore fan
GlWxwDFZgGw,2598319,2604839,of this  and it my hand dries really quickly so  what i'm going to do because it's what
GlWxwDFZgGw,2604839,2610160,everybody will want to know is compare  it to
GlWxwDFZgGw,2610640,2617200,my trusty dyson supersonic um this is  the latest iteration i've got it in the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2617200,2622560,beautiful navy with the gold at the back  so first of all let's compare
GlWxwDFZgGw,2622560,2630640,size wise the zuvi is about a centimeter  bigger in circumference slightly bigger
GlWxwDFZgGw,2630640,2637520,um and also  just ever so  ever so slightly longer so size wise
GlWxwDFZgGw,2637520,2645200,tiny bit bigger i actually think the  zuvi weighs a tiny bit less it's a  little bit lighter um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2645200,2652400,and price-wise quite incredibly and this  is why i wanted to do the review of them  both they are the exact same price when
GlWxwDFZgGw,2652400,2659680,i checked this morning they are both  currently for sale at 329 pounds which  is a very premium price for a hairdryer
GlWxwDFZgGw,2659680,2667280,but when i speak about the dyson  i always say  personally i spend hundreds of pounds um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2667280,2672480,getting my hair coloured literally  hundreds of pounds um it's very  expensive i personally am quite happy to
GlWxwDFZgGw,2672480,2679200,spend a few hundred pounds on an outfit  and you wear your hair every day so  actually i do think that hair tools that
GlWxwDFZgGw,2679200,2684480,really work for you are a fantastic  investment  i find that the dyson at supersonic does
GlWxwDFZgGw,2684480,2689520,dry my hair very quickly dyson in my  opinion are the masters of airflow they
GlWxwDFZgGw,2689520,2696560,have engineered it to perfection over  the last god knows how many years  and i really trust the dyson technology
GlWxwDFZgGw,2696560,2701760,i also love that many of the dyson  pieces are made here in the cotswolds  did you know that in malmsbury which is
GlWxwDFZgGw,2701760,2708240,a little bit further south than where we  are here in the cotswolds um  so let's talk about the zuvi
GlWxwDFZgGw,2708240,2714000,this is the zuli zuvi halo  it is made in china it's chinese company
GlWxwDFZgGw,2714000,2719599,i feel that with the price and the  design they're very much kind of coming  after that dyson  market
GlWxwDFZgGw,2719599,2725680,maybe you might choose this because um  i mean you're not going to choose it  because it was any cheaper i think i
GlWxwDFZgGw,2725680,2731440,mentioned it being a dupe earlier  certainly not a dupe when it's the same  price  i think it actually i like the look of
GlWxwDFZgGw,2731440,2736960,this because obviously it's white i  think that's really attractive i do have  the dyson supersonic in white as well
GlWxwDFZgGw,2736960,2744720,though the handle is  leather or a leather effect  um which is quite nice to hold
GlWxwDFZgGw,2744720,2751119,um it is light so great for traveling  but i have to say zuvi your cable is so  short
GlWxwDFZgGw,2751119,2758319,i mean  that is the total cable so if you don't  have
GlWxwDFZgGw,2758480,2763599,a plug underneath your dressing table or  if you're traveling they never have  plugs in the right places when you're
GlWxwDFZgGw,2763599,2770880,traveling so you're going to struggle to  get near a mirror potentially with this  so  what makes xuv different is they say
GlWxwDFZgGw,2770880,2777119,that their technology is inspired by  nature  so how does nature dry your hair well
GlWxwDFZgGw,2777119,2783599,with obviously  air um but also with the sun so this  you'll see in a second in fact i'll just
GlWxwDFZgGw,2783599,2788960,show you can you see  hopefully you could see then it's
GlWxwDFZgGw,2788960,2794560,lighting up so it they say that inspired  by nature they're using light
GlWxwDFZgGw,2794560,2799760,as well as air as opposed to just heat  to dry your hair so i'm suddenly really
GlWxwDFZgGw,2799760,2805359,self-conscious and i have not got  anything on my face i'm going to pop a  bit of lip balm
GlWxwDFZgGw,2805359,2812720,i would have put some makeup on but i  put vegeta liberated tanning drops in  with my serum this morning and i always  like to leave just that on my skin for
GlWxwDFZgGw,2812720,2817920,as long as possible um so yes inspired  by nature we have got
GlWxwDFZgGw,2817920,2825040,light and i believe it's uvs uva uvb  um using that light apparently to dry
GlWxwDFZgGw,2825040,2830319,your hair i don't know if that light  that's emitted from that is intense  enough to dry your hair but i like the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2830319,2836560,concept it's apparently more i'm saying  apparently because i'm not a scientist  and i can't test this by myself um
GlWxwDFZgGw,2836560,2841359,and  i'm not sure oh
GlWxwDFZgGw,2842160,2845720,hell hello darling
GlWxwDFZgGw,2847839,2852960,yeah i'll be down in five minutes just  dry my hair okay  okay yes i'm not i don't have the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2852960,2858960,ability to um check these claims myself  so i'm just gonna say apparently  apparently more energy efficient uses
GlWxwDFZgGw,2858960,2864640,less energy and of course it's always  going to be better for your hair if it  does use less heat this
GlWxwDFZgGw,2864640,2870640,from what i found from the two times  i've used it so far doesn't get as hot  as dyson and yet it is still drying my
GlWxwDFZgGw,2870640,2876720,hair pretty quickly but as i said when i  use my redken spray my hair dries very  quickly anyway so the products that i've
GlWxwDFZgGw,2876720,2882400,got on my hair this morning are the  redken spray and oh which by the way you
GlWxwDFZgGw,2882400,2887440,can use my look fantastic code to get 20  off josie  you can use that on the whole website
GlWxwDFZgGw,2887440,2893119,which is amazing and i love the weller  oil reflections luminous smoothing oil
GlWxwDFZgGw,2893119,2898480,and i put that through the ends of my  hair i'm very much in need of a color  and the cuts but these two are keeping
GlWxwDFZgGw,2898480,2905760,my hair in good nick  right  um four different settings care fast
GlWxwDFZgGw,2905760,2911760,soft and style you can use it just like  this you can use it with the
GlWxwDFZgGw,2911760,2918800,angled styler  and they've also got  um a big diffuser this is the kind of
GlWxwDFZgGw,2918800,2926319,thing that my mum loves to use with her  hair because it's shorter than mine it's  very fine and she likes to create volume
GlWxwDFZgGw,2926319,2932480,so this promises faster drying time  shinier and healthier hair  we took inspiration from nature's most
GlWxwDFZgGw,2932480,2938079,common method of water evaporation  occurs every day natural sunlight and  wind and built this into our patented
GlWxwDFZgGw,2938079,2944880,light care system that accelerates the  process for healthier hair  leaves your hair shiny and healthy
GlWxwDFZgGw,2944880,2951200,lower temperature retains twice the  internal moisture  locks in color
GlWxwDFZgGw,2951200,2957839,hair cuticles remain flat for enhanced  smoothness and shine so it's really  promising um that it's not going to over
GlWxwDFZgGw,2957839,2963839,dry the hair and it's saying that overly  dried hair leads to flyaways flitens and  breakage i mean to be honest it does
GlWxwDFZgGw,2963839,2970240,sound good and it does work really well  i think my main takeaway would be that
GlWxwDFZgGw,2970240,2975280,if you are using a hairdryer every  single day then this could be a really
GlWxwDFZgGw,2975280,2981760,good option for you and if you want a  quick powerful effect to blow dry then i  think the dyson is still
GlWxwDFZgGw,2981760,2988160,my number one and that's just my like  first impression  if i had the two available to me to
GlWxwDFZgGw,2988160,2993520,purchase  i have to say my gut instinct is still  saying to go with the dyson i just feel
GlWxwDFZgGw,2993520,2998880,like i trust the brand so much they know  all there is to know about
GlWxwDFZgGw,2998880,3005440,wind and airflow and they have really  become experts in the hair care space
GlWxwDFZgGw,3005440,3010880,but  it's nice to see someone else really  kind of coming into the market with a
GlWxwDFZgGw,3010880,3017280,product that is good i'd be really  intrigued to know what you guys feel  down below are you more inclined to go
GlWxwDFZgGw,3017280,3023920,with something new something exciting  something that does promise um those  things i just mentioned or would you
GlWxwDFZgGw,3023920,3029920,lean towards a brand that you're more  familiar with i have read so many  articles of people raving about this
GlWxwDFZgGw,3029920,3035680,um  but  this is going to sound really mean but
GlWxwDFZgGw,3035680,3040800,sometimes with magazines i do know in  the back of my head zuvi our promising
GlWxwDFZgGw,3040800,3046240,budget so um are people writing positive  things about it in the hope that zoopy  are gonna come along and do a paid
GlWxwDFZgGw,3046240,3052319,advertorial with them you know that is  how the industry works unfortunately so  i'm just giving you a totally honest um
GlWxwDFZgGw,3052319,3057760,feedback and review because  i'm not saying things in the hope that
GlWxwDFZgGw,3057760,3063440,suvi are going to pay me in the future  anyway i am going to finish drying my  hair
GlWxwDFZgGw,3063440,3068800,having a very relaxed day today at home  just continually popping over to see mum  i'm going to take her some plain rice in
GlWxwDFZgGw,3068800,3074720,a minute that's all she fancies so yeah  it's going to have a natural hair day so  i'm going to use the soft setting and
GlWxwDFZgGw,3074720,3081400,just um maybe a bristle brush to finish  drying my hair
GlWxwDFZgGw,3087950,3093599,[Applause]
GlWxwDFZgGw,3093599,3099200,okay we're about 95  dry now i would say which is all i feel
GlWxwDFZgGw,3099200,3106800,that i need to do on a day like today  when as i said i'm just spending the day  at home i did attempt to add a tiny bit
GlWxwDFZgGw,3106800,3112319,of curl with um my hot brush hot brush  um  round bristle brush
GlWxwDFZgGw,3112319,3117839,but on the soft setting at least i  wasn't getting enough temperature so  it's dried my hair but it's not styled
GlWxwDFZgGw,3117839,3124880,it  anyway i am going to end the vlog here  darlings um it's probably been quite a  long one now with this chat at the end
GlWxwDFZgGw,3124880,3130480,so thank you very much for watching  um i will leave both hair dryers linked
