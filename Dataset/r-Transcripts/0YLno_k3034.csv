0YLno_k3034,150,3070,"- If you've been bitten by a brown recluse spider,"
0YLno_k3034,3070,7120,"the first thing I can tell you, keep the spider."
0YLno_k3034,7120,8889,"Hi, I'm Anne Chappelle."
0YLno_k3034,8890,11150,"I'm a board certified toxicologist,"
0YLno_k3034,11150,13436,and this is Poison Support.
0YLno_k3034,13437,16104,[gentle music]
0YLno_k3034,17920,20940,"Jehovah's witness, Jehovah's Thickness asks,"
0YLno_k3034,20940,23820,so can you really poison people by putting eye drops
0YLno_k3034,23820,24860,in their food?
0YLno_k3034,24860,27010,I'm asking for a friend.
0YLno_k3034,27010,28210,Actually you can.
0YLno_k3034,28210,32070,There have been several high profile cases where a spouse
0YLno_k3034,32070,36090,has been accused of murder for putting Visine drops
0YLno_k3034,36090,39280,into their partner's beverages and food.
0YLno_k3034,39280,41750,The active ingredient in Visine
0YLno_k3034,41750,44190,causes your blood vessels to constrict.
0YLno_k3034,44190,46860,It works great on your eyes getting the red out.
0YLno_k3034,46860,49320,The problem is that when you ingest it
0YLno_k3034,49320,51020,"and you ingest enough of it,"
0YLno_k3034,51020,54400,it can cause your other blood vessels to also constrict.
0YLno_k3034,54400,57300,And when those constrict you can cut off blood supply
0YLno_k3034,57300,58710,to different parts of your body
0YLno_k3034,58710,61402,and have some overt toxicity.
0YLno_k3034,61402,63457,It's been shown that only a quarter teaspoon
0YLno_k3034,63457,68457,ingested by a child can actually cause significant toxicity.
0YLno_k3034,68490,72394,So you need to be very careful in where you keep your Visine
0YLno_k3034,72394,74810,or other similar eyedrops.
0YLno_k3034,74810,78119,"Next up, we have a question from Benjamin Sano."
0YLno_k3034,78120,80600,"Poison gas, how does that work?"
0YLno_k3034,80600,83010,"Well, first you go to Taco Bell."
0YLno_k3034,83010,83843,Just kidding.
0YLno_k3034,83843,86380,"Certain poison gases when you breathe them in,"
0YLno_k3034,86380,89380,they immediately destroy the lining of your lung.
0YLno_k3034,89380,91850,"And so if you don't have a good lung lining,"
0YLno_k3034,91850,93941,well then you really can't oxygenate your blood
0YLno_k3034,93941,95940,and then you can die.
0YLno_k3034,95940,100330,Poison gases can also work by interacting with the cells
0YLno_k3034,100330,103359,within your body and stop them from being able
0YLno_k3034,103359,105620,to produce energy.
0YLno_k3034,105620,107700,That's a really big deal when it comes to
0YLno_k3034,107700,109840,your heart and your brain.
0YLno_k3034,109840,111880,One of the most common poisonous gases
0YLno_k3034,111880,113520,is actually carbon monoxide.
0YLno_k3034,113520,117479,"Carbon monoxide poisoning often manifests as sleepiness,"
0YLno_k3034,117480,122160,"and unfortunately carbon monoxide is tasteless, odorless."
0YLno_k3034,122160,124570,And so you often won't be able to tell
0YLno_k3034,124570,126530,if you've been exposed to carbon monoxide.
0YLno_k3034,126530,129399,That's why those carbon monoxide detectors that you can get
0YLno_k3034,129399,131861,at your local big box store are so important.
0YLno_k3034,131861,134109,From Tatum Flynn.
0YLno_k3034,134110,137210,Can you get lead poisoning from stabbing yourself really
0YLno_k3034,137210,139220,hard with a sharp pencil?
0YLno_k3034,139220,140490,Asking for an idiot.
0YLno_k3034,140490,142440,"No, no you can't."
0YLno_k3034,142440,143430,No way.
0YLno_k3034,143430,145060,"Never, no how."
0YLno_k3034,145060,145970,You know why?
0YLno_k3034,145970,148460,Pencils don't contain lead.
0YLno_k3034,148460,152060,"Pencils actually contain a mix of graphite and clay,"
0YLno_k3034,152060,154459,which is considered non-toxic.
0YLno_k3034,154460,157990,We have a question now from Brendon FlyEaglesFly.
0YLno_k3034,157990,160240,Did you know that toothpaste can kill you
0YLno_k3034,160240,163220,because it's a poison if you eat the whole bottle at once?
0YLno_k3034,163220,166560,It even says use more for brushing than eating.
0YLno_k3034,166560,167470,Yes.
0YLno_k3034,167470,168690,Why yes I did.
0YLno_k3034,168690,172210,Fluoride when brushed on the teeth helps protect the enamel.
0YLno_k3034,172210,175860,"And so it's very good for your teeth, but again,"
0YLno_k3034,175860,177660,it's not very good to ingest
0YLno_k3034,177660,180560,because the fluoride is a lot like calcium.
0YLno_k3034,180560,183420,"So if you have too much fluoride in your body,"
0YLno_k3034,183420,184930,it displaces the calcium.
0YLno_k3034,184930,186140,Why is that important?
0YLno_k3034,186140,187830,Calcium is in your bones.
0YLno_k3034,187830,189570,So your bones aren't as strong
0YLno_k3034,189570,192270,as well as calcium is important in a number of different
0YLno_k3034,192270,195870,metabolic reactions that keep your body healthy.
0YLno_k3034,195870,199420,"If you did eat an entire thing of toothpaste,"
0YLno_k3034,199420,201020,that's something you really should call
0YLno_k3034,201020,202280,poison control about.
0YLno_k3034,202280,205930,That fluoride in your body could escalate to the point where
0YLno_k3034,205930,209349,"you have seizures, convulsions, death."
0YLno_k3034,209350,211370,So please take it seriously.
0YLno_k3034,211370,212700,Don't eat your toothpaste.
0YLno_k3034,212700,213700,Please spit.
0YLno_k3034,213700,215849,We have a question from Emily.
0YLno_k3034,215850,218607,Can you die of food poisoning?
0YLno_k3034,218607,221670,Absolutely you can die of food poisoning.
0YLno_k3034,221670,224650,Food poisoning is actually one of the most common poisonings
0YLno_k3034,224650,226620,that happens in the United States.
0YLno_k3034,226620,229080,According to the Centers for Disease Control
0YLno_k3034,229080,232880,one in six Americans suffer from some form
0YLno_k3034,232880,234197,"of food poisoning every year,"
0YLno_k3034,234197,239066,"128,000 Americans end up going to the hospital"
0YLno_k3034,239066,240760,for food poisoning.
0YLno_k3034,240760,245760,"And about 3,000 people die every year of food poisoning."
0YLno_k3034,245800,249720,The biggest problem with food poisoning is dehydration.
0YLno_k3034,249720,252090,"If you have several days of diarrhea,"
0YLno_k3034,252090,255849,you really need to make sure that you stay hydrated.
0YLno_k3034,255850,259510,Sometimes food poisoning can be very difficult to diagnose
0YLno_k3034,259510,263000,because you end up getting a delay between when you actually
0YLno_k3034,263000,266230,ate the food and actually when you became ill.
0YLno_k3034,266230,271230,Usually it is a delay of six to 12 hours for that toxin
0YLno_k3034,272420,274560,to start acting on your intestines
0YLno_k3034,274560,277600,and in your body to produce adverse health effects.
0YLno_k3034,277600,282060,Wife of Chadwick asks can you overdose on vitamins?
0YLno_k3034,282060,285070,Because those gummies are yummy and I keep popping them.
0YLno_k3034,285070,286060,"Yes, you can."
0YLno_k3034,286060,289270,"However, there is not always an adverse effect."
0YLno_k3034,289270,293199,"Many of the gummy vitamins are water-soluble vitamins,"
0YLno_k3034,293200,296010,which means that they don't get built up in your system.
0YLno_k3034,296010,298631,So if you've ever taken too many gummies or vitamins
0YLno_k3034,298631,302340,"and you've got kind of bright colored pee well,"
0YLno_k3034,302340,304230,you've overdosed just a bit.
0YLno_k3034,304230,306930,The problem is when you end up overdosing
0YLno_k3034,307823,309380,"on some of these fat-soluble vitamins,"
0YLno_k3034,309380,313660,"such as vitamin D, vitamin E, some of the Bs as well."
0YLno_k3034,313660,316620,Those like to sequester into your fat.
0YLno_k3034,316620,319500,And so they're harder to get rid of out of your body.
0YLno_k3034,319500,323550,Iron supplements can be also formulated into gummy vitamins.
0YLno_k3034,323550,325659,"And those are actually very dangerous,"
0YLno_k3034,325660,328850,especially for children to have an iron overdose.
0YLno_k3034,328850,332085,And so in all of these cases if you suspect that there is
0YLno_k3034,332085,336199,"unintended ingestion of these kinds of vitamins,"
0YLno_k3034,336200,339670,"it's important to run it by your poison control center,"
0YLno_k3034,339670,342060,especially if it's a child.
0YLno_k3034,342060,344550,So this one is from David Acosta.
0YLno_k3034,344550,347870,"Yo, I never had to call poison control at this point"
0YLno_k3034,347870,349324,in my life.
0YLno_k3034,349324,350366,How does it work?
0YLno_k3034,350366,352500,"Is there like a code system, press one for rat poison,"
0YLno_k3034,352500,354010,press two for cyanide?
0YLno_k3034,354010,355560,Do I need a subscription?
0YLno_k3034,355560,356990,Is there a free trial?
0YLno_k3034,356990,358819,"You know what, nevermind."
0YLno_k3034,358820,360710,"Well, it's really important that you know"
0YLno_k3034,360710,364530,that the first step in suspected poisoning
0YLno_k3034,364530,366930,is actually calling poison control.
0YLno_k3034,366930,370750,That's 1-800-222-1222.
0YLno_k3034,370750,374600,It's a national toll free number staffed 24/7.
0YLno_k3034,374600,376430,Now you may think that there are some times
0YLno_k3034,376430,380350,"when you need to call 911, or should I call poison control?"
0YLno_k3034,380350,383420,"Well, if the person is having an extreme medical emergency"
0YLno_k3034,383420,385980,right in front of you dial 911.
0YLno_k3034,385980,388770,"If you're not sure, still call 911,"
0YLno_k3034,388770,390639,especially if they're a child
0YLno_k3034,390640,393040,and then call poison control to follow up.
0YLno_k3034,393040,395930,Leonel asks a very important question.
0YLno_k3034,395930,399100,"Wait, wait, wait, how do poison antidotes work?"
0YLno_k3034,399100,401750,So there's a number of different kinds of antidotes.
0YLno_k3034,401750,404320,First of all there's the kind that actually just trap
0YLno_k3034,404320,405610,or absorb the chemical.
0YLno_k3034,405610,407460,There are some that actually go after
0YLno_k3034,408719,409919,and neutralize the chemical itself.
0YLno_k3034,409920,412080,Those are things like the antivenoms.
0YLno_k3034,412080,416078,Another one is that it actually inhibits the chemical
0YLno_k3034,416079,420070,at the site of the organ or toxicity.
0YLno_k3034,420070,422980,Here's a good example of an antidote
0YLno_k3034,422980,425999,"for a chemical overdose, opiates."
0YLno_k3034,425999,429120,You get too much oxycodone in your body
0YLno_k3034,429120,432000,and they give you the Naloxone spray.
0YLno_k3034,432000,434040,That actually gets into your body
0YLno_k3034,434040,438030,and that displaces the oxycodone from the sites
0YLno_k3034,438030,439150,where it activates.
0YLno_k3034,439150,441970,That's why you see such an immediate reversal
0YLno_k3034,441970,443930,after a Naloxone dose.
0YLno_k3034,443930,447280,Poison control and regional trauma centers often have
0YLno_k3034,447280,450120,antivenoms for the things that are local
0YLno_k3034,450120,451780,to that particular area.
0YLno_k3034,451780,455080,"But if you happen to be in Northern Ontario,"
0YLno_k3034,455080,456763,"where there are no rattlesnakes,"
0YLno_k3034,457837,458730,there's probably no antivenom.
0YLno_k3034,458730,461610,So be careful where you decide to get bit.
0YLno_k3034,461610,464939,"Ivves asks, how do we measure toxicity?"
0YLno_k3034,464940,467255,One of the most common ways to measure toxicity
0YLno_k3034,467255,472255,"is a test called an LD50 test, lethal dose 50."
0YLno_k3034,473420,476620,It means you give a dose to an animal and you find out what
0YLno_k3034,476620,479930,the dose is that kills 50% of those animals.
0YLno_k3034,479930,481810,"I know that sounds pretty barbaric,"
0YLno_k3034,481810,485832,but it is a way to analyze and figure out what the inherent
0YLno_k3034,485832,489437,toxicity of that substance happens to be.
0YLno_k3034,489437,493600,OneRaisedBrow asks did you know that activated charcoal
0YLno_k3034,493600,495330,can absorb poison?
0YLno_k3034,495330,498758,It's actually been used for hundreds and hundreds of years
0YLno_k3034,498759,501210,to absorb different toxicants.
0YLno_k3034,501210,505479,Activated charcoal works by actually physically binding
0YLno_k3034,505479,509830,that substance to itself in the digestive tract
0YLno_k3034,509830,512437,and traps it so that it is eliminated
0YLno_k3034,512437,516630,through either the feces or if it is flushed out
0YLno_k3034,516630,517483,of the stomach.
0YLno_k3034,518956,521334,One of the things they like about activated charcoal is that
0YLno_k3034,521335,524590,it acts on all kinds of different poisons and toxicants.
0YLno_k3034,524590,527240,So you don't necessarily have to know what the person
0YLno_k3034,527240,530630,was exposed to to be able to use it and potentially help
0YLno_k3034,530630,533040,eliminate any of these adverse reactions.
0YLno_k3034,533040,534810,"If you've already got something in your body,"
0YLno_k3034,534810,537790,activated charcoal isn't gonna pull that toxicant out
0YLno_k3034,537790,539350,of your cells and out of your body.
0YLno_k3034,539350,541990,The activated charcoal is really gonna focus on something
0YLno_k3034,541990,545149,"that is in your intestinal tract, your GI tract,"
0YLno_k3034,545150,548073,but it's really not meant to cleanse any other part
0YLno_k3034,548073,549737,of your body.
0YLno_k3034,549737,553180,"Angwin, anyone know what to do if you feel like"
0YLno_k3034,553180,555200,you've been poisoned 24/7?
0YLno_k3034,555200,557330,Go to the doctor.
0YLno_k3034,557330,560720,"If you feel awful for several days or several weeks,"
0YLno_k3034,560720,563129,keep a diary of some of your symptoms.
0YLno_k3034,563130,564500,What have you been eating?
0YLno_k3034,564500,565670,Where have you been going?
0YLno_k3034,565670,567370,What is your work environment like?
0YLno_k3034,567370,569460,That way you're able to give the doctor
0YLno_k3034,569460,571820,or nurse practitioner something to go on.
0YLno_k3034,571820,573700,Here's a question from Kerry Syndram.
0YLno_k3034,573700,575940,"If you ever accidentally swallow a poison,"
0YLno_k3034,575940,577460,"don't make yourself throw up,"
0YLno_k3034,577460,580032,drink as much water or milk as you can.
0YLno_k3034,580032,581751,I just saved your life.
0YLno_k3034,581751,584470,Not necessarily Kerry.
0YLno_k3034,584470,587155,Chemical agents have different hazardous properties.
0YLno_k3034,587156,592080,"For example, bleach is a very caustic agent,"
0YLno_k3034,592080,593503,which means it can burn you.
0YLno_k3034,594537,596032,"If you drank milk or water,"
0YLno_k3034,596953,598910,"you would think that that might dilute what you're having,"
0YLno_k3034,598910,600089,but not necessarily.
0YLno_k3034,600090,603430,Sometimes the water or the milk can make it worse.
0YLno_k3034,603430,606820,"In addition, if that makes you feel worse"
0YLno_k3034,606820,608380,"and you accidentally throw up,"
0YLno_k3034,608380,611580,"there's a condition called aspiration pneumonitis,"
0YLno_k3034,611580,614610,which is essentially you inhale your vomit.
0YLno_k3034,614610,618279,Imagine how much worse it is if you inhaled vomit
0YLno_k3034,618280,619630,"that was full of bleach,"
0YLno_k3034,619630,621540,that would also damage your lungs.
0YLno_k3034,621540,624594,So don't just assume that water or milk is the appropriate
0YLno_k3034,624594,629272,treatment for an overdose or exposure to any kind of poison.
0YLno_k3034,629272,633496,"Shoulda Retired says hey toxicology Twitter,"
0YLno_k3034,633496,635339,"@ScreamingMD, @RyanMarino,"
0YLno_k3034,635340,638580,what's the Dapsone dose for a brown recluse bite?
0YLno_k3034,638580,642580,A brown recluse spider is a kind of spider that causes
0YLno_k3034,642580,646860,in some cases a necrotizing wound.
0YLno_k3034,646860,649450,That means all of the skin cells are dying.
0YLno_k3034,649450,652370,"If you've been bitten by a brown recluse spider,"
0YLno_k3034,652370,656456,the first thing I can tell you keep the spider.
0YLno_k3034,656456,660790,"Even if you smash it, put it into a little jar so that if"
0YLno_k3034,660790,664420,"you get some kind of necrotizing wound,"
0YLno_k3034,664420,668459,"it's like a gross pussy painful spot,"
0YLno_k3034,668460,670770,you can tell the doctor so that they can
0YLno_k3034,670770,672010,treat you appropriately.
0YLno_k3034,672010,675460,The question was for this one is Dapsone treatment.
0YLno_k3034,675460,680360,Dapsone is an antibiotic often given to leprosy patients.
0YLno_k3034,680360,682990,So you might think is that really appropriate
0YLno_k3034,682990,684610,for a brown recluse spider bite?
0YLno_k3034,684610,687800,There's a number of research papers that have compared
0YLno_k3034,687800,690339,"treatment for brown recluse spider bites,"
0YLno_k3034,690340,692280,"between the different standard of care,"
0YLno_k3034,692280,696000,the antibiotics and such with adding Dapsone.
0YLno_k3034,696000,697490,And the evidence is mixed.
0YLno_k3034,697490,700240,"I have a question here from Anna7,"
0YLno_k3034,700240,703300,what the [bleep] is syrup of ipecac?
0YLno_k3034,703300,708300,Syrup of ipecac is a syrup that is made from
0YLno_k3034,708460,712880,the dried root of a South American plant.
0YLno_k3034,712880,717610,It is used in the emergency room to make you vomit.
0YLno_k3034,717610,719605,That's what it does.
0YLno_k3034,719605,720800,"If you're going to use syrup of ipecac,"
0YLno_k3034,720800,723730,you really should call poison control first
0YLno_k3034,723730,726688,to make sure that you should be up chucking
0YLno_k3034,726688,728430,what you ingested.
0YLno_k3034,728430,732561,"Because sometimes if things are really caustic, corrosive,"
0YLno_k3034,732561,737350,"things like battery acid, Draino, bleach,"
0YLno_k3034,737350,740449,that can cause more damage on the way back up.
0YLno_k3034,740450,744330,The problem with syrup of ipecac also is that it has been
0YLno_k3034,744330,748800,abused for many years by people that didn't know how to make
0YLno_k3034,748800,751570,"themselves throw up, but they wanted to lose weight."
0YLno_k3034,751570,755510,One of the most famous deaths related to syrup of ipecac
0YLno_k3034,755510,759190,was actually Karen Carpenter in 1983.
0YLno_k3034,759190,764190,She had severe anorexia and kept taking syrup of ipecac
0YLno_k3034,764450,765480,to make her vomit.
0YLno_k3034,765480,768805,Over time syrup of ipecac damaged her heart.
0YLno_k3034,768805,772470,So it caused her to have a heart attack and die.
0YLno_k3034,772470,774324,A question from Andrew King.
0YLno_k3034,774325,777190,"Poinsettia cupcakes but no Yule logs,"
0YLno_k3034,777190,780200,wait aren't poinsettias poisonous?
0YLno_k3034,780200,781850,That is actually a bit of a myth.
0YLno_k3034,781850,784940,"If you eat a significant number of poinsettia leaves,"
0YLno_k3034,784940,787210,you might become a little nauseous
0YLno_k3034,787210,790340,or you might be able to reach a potentially toxic dose.
0YLno_k3034,790340,795340,A child weighing 50 pounds has to eat 500 poinsettia leaves
0YLno_k3034,795370,798230,to actually reach a dose that would result
0YLno_k3034,798230,800029,in significant toxicity.
0YLno_k3034,800030,801864,Zoe is just kitten around.
0YLno_k3034,801864,804870,I want to at the very least learn how to tell
0YLno_k3034,804870,807420,a poison mushroom apart from an edible one.
0YLno_k3034,807420,810139,Here is a really easy way to tell them apart.
0YLno_k3034,810140,813060,"If it's at a grocery store, you can eat it."
0YLno_k3034,813060,815360,You need to be very careful about foraging
0YLno_k3034,815360,816690,"for your own mushrooms,"
0YLno_k3034,816690,819690,because it is very difficult to tell a poisonous mushroom
0YLno_k3034,819690,821700,apart from an edible mushroom.
0YLno_k3034,821700,825000,Because there's only about 100 poisonous mushrooms out of
0YLno_k3034,825000,827140,all the mushrooms that are out there
0YLno_k3034,827140,829408,what are the chances that you actually picked
0YLno_k3034,829408,831150,a poisonous one?
0YLno_k3034,831150,832780,Do you really want to find out?
0YLno_k3034,832780,836840,"Every year there are about 6,000 mushroom poisonings"
0YLno_k3034,836840,838780,reported to the CDC.
0YLno_k3034,838780,842230,Half of those are from ingestions from children.
0YLno_k3034,842230,844930,So please help educate your children
0YLno_k3034,844930,848120,not eat random mushrooms in your backyard.
0YLno_k3034,848120,849990,"Alright, that's all the questions."
0YLno_k3034,849990,851950,I had a really good time today
0YLno_k3034,851950,853913,and I hope we can do it again sometime.
