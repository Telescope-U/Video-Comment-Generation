qmBztO_FyL0,5040,7520,i made it part of my morning routine to
qmBztO_FyL0,7520,9280,go outside
qmBztO_FyL0,9280,12799,have a cup of coffee and listen to this
qmBztO_FyL0,12799,14719,app that gives you
qmBztO_FyL0,14719,18320,basically 15-minute summaries of books
qmBztO_FyL0,18320,21039,right kind of randomizes it for me
qmBztO_FyL0,21039,22320,and this morning the one that came on
qmBztO_FyL0,22320,25599,was called how to talk to anyone
qmBztO_FyL0,25599,27359,and there was a part that really stuck
qmBztO_FyL0,27359,28480,out to me
qmBztO_FyL0,28480,30960,talked about being methodical
qmBztO_FyL0,30960,33360,about who you interact with particularly
qmBztO_FyL0,33360,36239,in a social setting the idea being that
qmBztO_FyL0,36239,38239,uh you don't need to be some type of
qmBztO_FyL0,38239,40640,polished politician to be able to
qmBztO_FyL0,40640,43120,navigate a party or work a room
qmBztO_FyL0,43120,44640,and it goes into
qmBztO_FyL0,44640,47520,you know planning the idea
qmBztO_FyL0,47520,49440,like eating before the gathering or
qmBztO_FyL0,49440,51039,parties so while you're there you can
qmBztO_FyL0,51039,53039,focus on connecting with the people you
qmBztO_FyL0,53039,55600,want to connect with uh getting the most
qmBztO_FyL0,55600,57520,out of your time there
qmBztO_FyL0,57520,58980,that type of thing makes sense
qmBztO_FyL0,58980,60719,[Music]
qmBztO_FyL0,60719,62719,but the line or or the way it was summed
qmBztO_FyL0,62719,65119,up that really got me was
qmBztO_FyL0,65119,66799,in that situation
qmBztO_FyL0,66799,69600,be the chooser
qmBztO_FyL0,69600,70840,not the
qmBztO_FyL0,70840,72560,choice
qmBztO_FyL0,72560,74560,pretty powerful framing there right
qmBztO_FyL0,74560,77040,think about how often when we don't ask
qmBztO_FyL0,77040,79360,ourselves what an ideal ending is what
qmBztO_FyL0,79360,81119,we want
qmBztO_FyL0,81119,82000,and
qmBztO_FyL0,82000,85360,we simply show up and go with the flow
qmBztO_FyL0,85360,87680,we're actually forfeiting our ability to
qmBztO_FyL0,87680,91119,shape the outcome of the evening
qmBztO_FyL0,91119,93040,it's instead going to be shaped by the
qmBztO_FyL0,93040,94000,people
qmBztO_FyL0,94000,96240,who do have a preference and act
qmBztO_FyL0,96240,98079,accordingly
qmBztO_FyL0,98079,100079,in other words we're willingly signing
qmBztO_FyL0,100079,102479,up to be a part of their plan
qmBztO_FyL0,102479,105280,we're signing on to be the choice
qmBztO_FyL0,105280,108159,and not as the passage says
qmBztO_FyL0,108159,111039,the chooser
qmBztO_FyL0,111119,112560,like so many things you know you can
qmBztO_FyL0,112560,114720,take a single idea or concept from one
qmBztO_FyL0,114720,115759,area
qmBztO_FyL0,115759,117119,and uh
qmBztO_FyL0,117119,118560,point it at something else right it
qmBztO_FyL0,118560,121680,applies across the board how many places
qmBztO_FyL0,121680,123680,in our lives are we just
qmBztO_FyL0,123680,125840,going along without any visualized
qmBztO_FyL0,125840,129200,outcome or goal in what areas are we
qmBztO_FyL0,129200,132239,showing up to the metaphorical gathering
qmBztO_FyL0,132239,135040,with no ideal outcome in mind hoping the
qmBztO_FyL0,135040,137520,right people come to us
qmBztO_FyL0,137520,139520,the right things appear
qmBztO_FyL0,139520,141440,to us
qmBztO_FyL0,141440,142720,and of course
qmBztO_FyL0,142720,144800,you know life is messy no plans going to
qmBztO_FyL0,144800,146959,be perfect
qmBztO_FyL0,146959,149200,but there's plenty of truth to that old
qmBztO_FyL0,149200,151360,saying you can't hit a target that you
qmBztO_FyL0,151360,154879,haven't created that isn't there
qmBztO_FyL0,154879,156239,and if you don't take the wheel and
qmBztO_FyL0,156239,158239,these little segments of your life you
qmBztO_FyL0,158239,160879,can't then be disappointed
qmBztO_FyL0,160879,162640,when things don't happen when the car
qmBztO_FyL0,162640,166319,doesn't go where you wanted it to go
qmBztO_FyL0,166480,168160,no the one holding the wheel will
qmBztO_FyL0,168160,171640,determine that
qmBztO_FyL0,172959,175040,now let's be real identifying what you
qmBztO_FyL0,175040,178000,want and pursuing it is definitely more
qmBztO_FyL0,178000,179680,challenging right it takes more effort
qmBztO_FyL0,179680,183519,and sacrifice it's emotionally taxing
qmBztO_FyL0,183519,187120,because now there's something at stake
qmBztO_FyL0,187920,190319,but you also position yourself to now
qmBztO_FyL0,190319,192720,get something worthwhile out of the
qmBztO_FyL0,192720,195360,situation
qmBztO_FyL0,195360,197280,a situation you otherwise would have had
qmBztO_FyL0,197280,199120,very little control over right i've
qmBztO_FyL0,199120,201280,referenced a few times my eighth grade
qmBztO_FyL0,201280,202720,teacher telling us
qmBztO_FyL0,202720,206560,never to hold our hands up to the sky
qmBztO_FyL0,206560,208239,and he would clasp his hands together to
qmBztO_FyL0,208239,210640,make this little bowl and hold them out
qmBztO_FyL0,210640,212720,but he'd say never just hold them out
qmBztO_FyL0,212720,216879,and hope something falls into them
qmBztO_FyL0,216879,218799,as the saying goes hope is not a
qmBztO_FyL0,218799,221280,strategy and i think there are different
qmBztO_FyL0,221280,224799,levels to this for sure
qmBztO_FyL0,224799,226640,it's one thing to never think about what
qmBztO_FyL0,226640,228879,you want in life at all
qmBztO_FyL0,228879,230879,it's another thing to walk into a party
qmBztO_FyL0,230879,232720,and snack on the pretzels instead of
qmBztO_FyL0,232720,234400,connecting with someone right they're
qmBztO_FyL0,234400,236720,very different but when we understand
qmBztO_FyL0,236720,239200,that underneath both of them underneath
qmBztO_FyL0,239200,243760,all of it the same principle applies
qmBztO_FyL0,243840,246799,we can at least recognize
qmBztO_FyL0,246799,249120,where they're happening in our lives
qmBztO_FyL0,249120,252840,some small some bigger and perhaps more
qmBztO_FyL0,252840,256879,important layers to a cake
qmBztO_FyL0,257759,261199,but why wouldn't it always be beneficial
qmBztO_FyL0,261199,264479,to ask yourself one what matters and to
qmBztO_FyL0,264479,266840,what can i do to bring me closer to what
qmBztO_FyL0,266840,271280,matters at least then you're cognizant
qmBztO_FyL0,271280,273360,i think often the greatest opportunities
qmBztO_FyL0,273360,275040,lost
qmBztO_FyL0,275040,277040,are lost simply because we're not aware
qmBztO_FyL0,277040,279199,of them right so if we make ourselves
qmBztO_FyL0,279199,280479,aware
qmBztO_FyL0,280479,283440,and we missed the opportunity
qmBztO_FyL0,283440,285280,let's make sure we missed it because we
qmBztO_FyL0,285280,289120,looked it in the eye and chose no
qmBztO_FyL0,289120,290960,we met that additional layer of
qmBztO_FyL0,290960,293040,resistance and still said no thank you
qmBztO_FyL0,293040,297199,right there's intentionality to it
qmBztO_FyL0,297199,299120,i remember reading darren hardy's book
qmBztO_FyL0,299120,301120,the compound effect
qmBztO_FyL0,301120,302639,and he's someone that
qmBztO_FyL0,302639,305199,is apparently incredibly meticulous
qmBztO_FyL0,305199,306639,about everything he does
qmBztO_FyL0,306639,308160,to the point where
qmBztO_FyL0,308160,310639,he would write out a description for his
qmBztO_FyL0,310639,312880,future significant other like if it were
qmBztO_FyL0,312880,316160,a dream world the exact person he was
qmBztO_FyL0,316160,317600,hoping to spend the rest of his life
qmBztO_FyL0,317600,320400,with from her eye color hair what she
qmBztO_FyL0,320400,322840,enjoyed doing all that
qmBztO_FyL0,322840,325520,stuff and
qmBztO_FyL0,325520,326560,you know it goes to show you the
qmBztO_FyL0,326560,328320,difference a few years can make the
qmBztO_FyL0,328320,329680,first time i read that i thought well
qmBztO_FyL0,329680,330720,that's
qmBztO_FyL0,330720,333600,way too extreme i skipped right over it
qmBztO_FyL0,333600,335680,uh now i look at that and i'm like yeah
qmBztO_FyL0,335680,338800,he's just creating an ideal
qmBztO_FyL0,338800,339840,so that
qmBztO_FyL0,339840,342400,in the real tangible world he can put
qmBztO_FyL0,342400,344639,himself in the best position to attract
qmBztO_FyL0,344639,346400,that person
qmBztO_FyL0,346400,349039,he's creating a goal
qmBztO_FyL0,349039,350479,otherwise what's the alternative you
qmBztO_FyL0,350479,352720,just kind of walk around and hope uh you
qmBztO_FyL0,352720,354560,know someone appears around a corner
qmBztO_FyL0,354560,356720,someday who aligns with you and what you
qmBztO_FyL0,356720,358800,want and your interests and
qmBztO_FyL0,358800,360880,it's rolling dice
qmBztO_FyL0,360880,362880,there's just too many variables in life
qmBztO_FyL0,362880,365039,to constantly be wishing or crossing
qmBztO_FyL0,365039,366400,your fingers
qmBztO_FyL0,366400,370639,leaving things up to chance or fate
qmBztO_FyL0,370960,373039,there has to be some general sense of
qmBztO_FyL0,373039,375520,direction
qmBztO_FyL0,375840,377440,and i've had this kind of miniature
qmBztO_FyL0,377440,378800,epiphany
qmBztO_FyL0,378800,382400,in many aspects of my life
qmBztO_FyL0,382720,385199,for example you know business i've been
qmBztO_FyL0,385199,386479,asked what do you want it to look like
qmBztO_FyL0,386479,388880,the next five years
qmBztO_FyL0,388880,390880,it used to be well five years a long
qmBztO_FyL0,390880,394639,time away do i really need to know
qmBztO_FyL0,394639,396240,it's like if you don't know then what
qmBztO_FyL0,396240,398319,are you doing today
qmBztO_FyL0,398319,399759,you just repeating what you've always
qmBztO_FyL0,399759,402319,done are you acting randomly and hoping
qmBztO_FyL0,402319,404000,it takes you somewhere that will make
qmBztO_FyL0,404000,405919,you happy down the road
qmBztO_FyL0,405919,408400,no you have a vision and as bezos said
qmBztO_FyL0,408400,410400,you hold the vision and you continually
qmBztO_FyL0,410400,412639,adjust the process
qmBztO_FyL0,412639,415199,again life is messy things will change
qmBztO_FyL0,415199,417759,five million times and that's okay but
qmBztO_FyL0,417759,419440,there's a better chance good things will
qmBztO_FyL0,419440,421680,happen to you if you identify what they
qmBztO_FyL0,421680,423080,are and seek them out
qmBztO_FyL0,423080,424479,[Music]
qmBztO_FyL0,424479,426800,even smaller example boston my home i
qmBztO_FyL0,426800,430478,live there i love the people there
qmBztO_FyL0,431039,432080,but
qmBztO_FyL0,432080,433680,you know five years ago i was at a point
qmBztO_FyL0,433680,435680,where my work was remote my team was
qmBztO_FyL0,435680,437599,remote
qmBztO_FyL0,437599,440000,so rather than simply endure uh you know
qmBztO_FyL0,440000,442080,november to june every year i asked
qmBztO_FyL0,442080,444400,myself well what's my ideal lifestyle
qmBztO_FyL0,444400,446400,like
qmBztO_FyL0,446400,448240,what if i design around that why not
qmBztO_FyL0,448240,450240,move somewhere that really excites me
qmBztO_FyL0,450240,452960,now i can run in the heat uh in in
qmBztO_FyL0,452960,455440,january in miami right that's not a
qmBztO_FyL0,455440,457199,small thing in my life that makes me a
qmBztO_FyL0,457199,458960,lot happier
qmBztO_FyL0,458960,459840,um
qmBztO_FyL0,459840,461759,and so it's it's little things like that
qmBztO_FyL0,461759,463599,you know you get the point from the big
qmBztO_FyL0,463599,467520,things to the the tiny details if you
qmBztO_FyL0,467520,469520,don't choose what you want or choose
qmBztO_FyL0,469520,470879,your path
qmBztO_FyL0,470879,475360,life will simply choose it for you
qmBztO_FyL0,475360,477360,and that may or may not you know be in
qmBztO_FyL0,477360,480800,line with what makes you happy
qmBztO_FyL0,480800,482720,or the idea as many of us have heard in
qmBztO_FyL0,482720,483919,a different way
qmBztO_FyL0,483919,486400,if you don't pursue your dreams
qmBztO_FyL0,486400,488240,you will undoubtedly spend your days
qmBztO_FyL0,488240,489840,working to help someone else build
qmBztO_FyL0,489840,492400,theirs
qmBztO_FyL0,492400,495360,without you taking control taking
qmBztO_FyL0,495360,496479,initiative
qmBztO_FyL0,496479,499280,life will and you will become a pawn on
qmBztO_FyL0,499280,502879,the chessboard of life
qmBztO_FyL0,502879,505120,so ask the questions
qmBztO_FyL0,505120,507280,you know look in the mirror and delve
qmBztO_FyL0,507280,509360,into the aspirations of the person
qmBztO_FyL0,509360,511680,looking back at you
qmBztO_FyL0,511680,514080,from social events sure to your
qmBztO_FyL0,514080,516000,significant other to your work or
qmBztO_FyL0,516000,520880,business to your overall life goal
qmBztO_FyL0,520880,523518,what matters to you
qmBztO_FyL0,523518,526640,in these various arenas of your life
qmBztO_FyL0,526640,529519,what does success look like
qmBztO_FyL0,529519,531680,what does fulfillment
qmBztO_FyL0,531680,534959,feel like
qmBztO_FyL0,534959,536800,and once you have that blueprint in your
qmBztO_FyL0,536800,540480,mind you are now on the road to ensuring
qmBztO_FyL0,540480,543279,its construction
qmBztO_FyL0,543839,546240,the construction not of a world you were
qmBztO_FyL0,546240,547600,given
qmBztO_FyL0,547600,549680,but of a world
qmBztO_FyL0,549680,553000,you chose
qmBztO_FyL0,554030,566010,[Music]
qmBztO_FyL0,566800,568880,you
