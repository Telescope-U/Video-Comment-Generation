FgtGg2-4S5M,160,7359,is apple robbing people with their ssd and ram upgrade prices well yes and no 
FgtGg2-4S5M,7920,13200,let's go ahead and see how apple stacks up to their main competitors and see if 
FgtGg2-4S5M,13200,19439,they're really ripping people off with their prices and their performance now 
FgtGg2-4S5M,19440,21280,some people say it is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,21280,28400,2022. how can apple get away with offering eight gigs of ram and 256 
FgtGg2-4S5M,28400,34640,gigabytes of storage on these expensive new machines even the brand new m2 
FgtGg2-4S5M,34640,40320,macbook air that's a higher price point still sticks with the same amount of ssd 
FgtGg2-4S5M,40320,44160,and ram that the retina macbook pro came with 10 
FgtGg2-4S5M,44800,50000,years ago and back then you could upgrade that 8 gigabyte to 16 gigabyte 
FgtGg2-4S5M,50000,55360,for you probably guessed it the same price that you can upgrade right now 200 
FgtGg2-4S5M,56240,60400,and shouldn't technology get cheaper as time goes on 
FgtGg2-4S5M,60960,64799,well yeah but we also have some major differences first off 
FgtGg2-4S5M,65360,70400,the ssds the apple that are coming out with now are way faster than before the 
FgtGg2-4S5M,70400,75280,256 gig in these macbooks with apple silk and chips go up to about 2 
FgtGg2-4S5M,75840,81600,300 for the read and over 2 800 megabytes per second for their right 
FgtGg2-4S5M,81600,85840,compared to about that 400. now apple has been very consistent with their 
FgtGg2-4S5M,85840,89920,upgrade prices over the years and they've never been cheap but they have 
FgtGg2-4S5M,89920,94880,offered some decent values at times for performance for example when they made 
FgtGg2-4S5M,94880,102240,the jump from the 2020 macbook airs to the m1s the speeds of the ssds got much 
FgtGg2-4S5M,102240,106560,faster going from 1300 megabyte per second read to 
FgtGg2-4S5M,106560,114159,2800 and from 800 right all the way up to 2300 
FgtGg2-4S5M,114160,118800,and at that time ssds were more expensive and then considering the fact 
FgtGg2-4S5M,118800,125600,that for a more expensive dell you were getting speeds of 1080 for right in 1900 
FgtGg2-4S5M,125600,131200,for read with the same capacity compared to the macbooks that was actually a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,131200,136080,pretty good deal and the same thing went when apple released their redesigned 14 
FgtGg2-4S5M,136080,141840,and 16 inch macbook pros with ssds that went over 7 000 megabytes per second 
FgtGg2-4S5M,142480,148000,and they kept the prices for upgrades the same as before so in those machines 
FgtGg2-4S5M,148000,153120,if you're dropping an extra 200 that is a decent value but i believe the times 
FgtGg2-4S5M,153120,163120,have now shifted in 2022 for one you can now get a good 500 gigabyte ssd for 75 
FgtGg2-4S5M,163120,168640,bucks on amazon and of course you cannot put that into your macbook pro and 
FgtGg2-4S5M,168640,174319,second we now have some great laptops like dell's xps 13 plus that are 
FgtGg2-4S5M,174320,180640,offering fast ssds for great prices so now let's get into the comparison with 
FgtGg2-4S5M,180640,185680,the competition starting out with the laptop that i really like microsoft's 
FgtGg2-4S5M,185680,191200,surface laptop 4 this thing has a nice squarish display 
FgtGg2-4S5M,191920,196880,it has good speakers very nice ones it's a great all-around laptop and it also 
FgtGg2-4S5M,196880,202320,comes with 8 gigs of ram for base and 256 gigs of storage taking a look at 
FgtGg2-4S5M,202320,208000,their pricing microsoft is also charging 200 bucks to upgrade from 8 to 16 gigs 
FgtGg2-4S5M,208000,213280,of ram and the same thing goes for the storage up to 512 
FgtGg2-4S5M,213280,218160,and if you do drop that extra 200 bucks to go up to 512 their read speed is only 
FgtGg2-4S5M,218160,223680,2 280 compared to 2825 and the right is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,223680,232000,170 compared to 2 900 on the macbook air 512. now that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,232000,236960,just one laptop a microsoft's option it's a premium laptop let's set that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,236960,242080,aside let's look at another option from razer they also gave you the base model 
FgtGg2-4S5M,242080,246960,of 8 gig and 256 and then if you want to upgrade you can't do that you have to 
FgtGg2-4S5M,246960,252640,jump up to the 1500 model which doubles your ssd and ram and gets you a little 
FgtGg2-4S5M,252640,258160,bit faster processor now thankfully the performance is better than the surface 
FgtGg2-4S5M,258160,265040,laptop we have 2200 right and 2700 read so technically they're 
FgtGg2-4S5M,265040,269360,charging the same as apple now you also have that additional hundred bucks to 
FgtGg2-4S5M,269360,273759,give you the better processor but of course the m1 still destroys that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,273760,278880,processor and the laptop as a whole is better overall and now we have the m2 
FgtGg2-4S5M,278880,284320,coming out now i also looked at some think pads i looked at some lg's 
FgtGg2-4S5M,284320,289360,samsung's but the situation is fairly similar if some have higher specs some 
FgtGg2-4S5M,289360,291439,are actually more expensive than like the macbooks 
FgtGg2-4S5M,292160,297280,or it's just really slow so let's skip to what i'm actually impressed with and 
FgtGg2-4S5M,297280,302240,that is dell's latest xps lineup we have the regular xps that starts at a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,302240,306639,thousand bucks with a slow processor and a bad screen we've reviewed those before 
FgtGg2-4S5M,306640,313360,and then we have their brand new xps 13 plus which is very impressive now right 
FgtGg2-4S5M,313360,319120,out of the get-go their price tag is actually higher than the new m2 macbook 
FgtGg2-4S5M,319120,325040,pro and air and it does come with a much worse screen slower processor but they 
FgtGg2-4S5M,325040,330960,do give you 512 gigs of ssd out of the box you still get 8 gigs of ram but 
FgtGg2-4S5M,330960,336720,instead of costing you 200 to upgrade like with max and apple it only costs 
FgtGg2-4S5M,336720,337840,you 100 
FgtGg2-4S5M,338960,344639,to make that jump that is excellent and it is new fast ram and then as far as 
FgtGg2-4S5M,344640,352480,the ssds to upgrade a one terabyte it is another 100 jump not a 200 jump that it 
FgtGg2-4S5M,352480,359360,costs you with apple's macbooks now not only is it cheaper it is actually better 
FgtGg2-4S5M,359360,365840,first off that ssd is actually removable so you can upgrade it yourself 
FgtGg2-4S5M,366400,372080,but with that you wouldn't really want to because look at these speeds we have 
FgtGg2-4S5M,372080,378560,5 000 megabytes per second right compared to 2900 on the macbook and 6 
FgtGg2-4S5M,379280,386000,700 read compared to 2825 that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,386000,390320,incredible and that just shows you what they could do when they have a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,390320,392480,little slot on their macbook you just buy market 
FgtGg2-4S5M,393120,399120,ssds for great prices and then of course apple is soldering theirs in so that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,399120,404160,incredible now of course this laptop they did some really weird things uh 
FgtGg2-4S5M,404160,407840,like not even giving you a headphone jack you can get an adapter that'll ship 
FgtGg2-4S5M,407840,412160,separately to you and you only have two ports and of course i have a touch bar 
FgtGg2-4S5M,412160,415280,thing i'm still very excited to check this thing out 
FgtGg2-4S5M,416000,420000,if you guys want to see a comparison hit that subscribe button down below 
FgtGg2-4S5M,420560,425200,because we will be comparing it but it's still cool to see a good value and a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,425200,429600,company is trying to be competitive and giving you these kind of prices now 
FgtGg2-4S5M,429600,435040,of course with that with apple's ram it's not the same as ram on these 
FgtGg2-4S5M,435040,438960,machines that is unified they have to build it into the chip itself so that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,438960,443600,makes that more expensive and you don't need as much ram as you do with the 
FgtGg2-4S5M,443600,447840,windows system we actually have done comparisons showing how we're comparing 
FgtGg2-4S5M,447840,453919,8 gigs to 16 comparing intel to apple silicon windows and mac showing you that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,453920,459200,8 gigs performs much closer to 16 when you had that in the past without unified 
FgtGg2-4S5M,459200,462080,memory because you have a lot less duplication 
FgtGg2-4S5M,462640,467360,that is used for graphics it's a lot more optimized so even though it costs 
FgtGg2-4S5M,467360,470400,more money they're using it with a different process you don't need to 
FgtGg2-4S5M,470400,476479,upgrade uh and get as much as you did previously for most tasks so as far as 
FgtGg2-4S5M,476480,481040,apple robbing people i mean some of these prices are crazy 
FgtGg2-4S5M,481040,484640,paying 200 bucks for 128 gig of extra storage 
FgtGg2-4S5M,485200,488880,it's too much definitely too much we tell a lot of you guys buy an external 
FgtGg2-4S5M,488880,493280,ssd we've showed off the savings many times works with thunderbolt and usbc 
FgtGg2-4S5M,493280,497200,you can plug it into any computer you can keep it with you if you upgrade your 
FgtGg2-4S5M,497200,501040,mac that's what i would suggest for you guys and as far as their ram 
FgtGg2-4S5M,501680,505759,it is expensive but you don't need as much as you think make sure you guys 
FgtGg2-4S5M,505760,509520,check out these those other videos that i talked about now what i do think 
FgtGg2-4S5M,509520,513599,they're robbing people with are their other devices not the macbooks but the 
FgtGg2-4S5M,513599,517120,ipads for example the ipad air this is just 
FgtGg2-4S5M,517680,520880,crazy if 64 gigs at the base that's not enough 
FgtGg2-4S5M,520880,524640,for most people if you're gonna be really using this device but they just 
FgtGg2-4S5M,524640,529280,skipped out the 128 gig option that they let you get on other devices and you 
FgtGg2-4S5M,529280,533680,have to spend 150 bucks to jump up to 256 which of course gets you really 
FgtGg2-4S5M,533680,540080,close to the ipad pro once again getting you to spend more money now with this 
FgtGg2-4S5M,540080,543520,external options with external disease aren't as useful it's a much more 
FgtGg2-4S5M,543520,547200,portable device and there's other issues that i talked about in my ipad os 16 
FgtGg2-4S5M,547200,553760,video now for the ipad pro it gets even worse and i think completely unexcusable 
FgtGg2-4S5M,553760,557360,if you want to have a good amount of storage to use as a pro device for media 
FgtGg2-4S5M,557360,562320,editing you might want to get one terabyte of storage but as you see it 
FgtGg2-4S5M,562320,567920,cost you 400 bucks to go from 512 to one terabyte that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,567920,574000,insane where at the same time for 75 bucks you can get uh one m.2 stick like 
FgtGg2-4S5M,574000,579440,i showed you the samsung for 500 gigs now that is because not only are they 
FgtGg2-4S5M,579440,584560,charging you these kind of outrageous prices but they're locking in a 16 gig 
FgtGg2-4S5M,584560,590640,ram upgrade with that capacity as well so if you don't need the ram and now we 
FgtGg2-4S5M,590640,594640,know ipad os 16 will use swap so you don't need that extra ram 
FgtGg2-4S5M,595200,599920,uh but you do want more storage you're out of luck you have to get it or vice 
FgtGg2-4S5M,599920,605360,versa where the same exact m1 chip in a macbook air you can choose the storage 
FgtGg2-4S5M,605360,610480,or the ram even if the ram is built in so this is how apple is robbing people 
FgtGg2-4S5M,611040,617839,of their money forcing them to buy options that they might not even need so 
FgtGg2-4S5M,617840,623680,that is my perspective i hope that apple at least upgrades and puts better ssds 
FgtGg2-4S5M,623680,626000,in some of these devices when they're charging this much money 
FgtGg2-4S5M,626640,631440,and overall wants to lower their prices but the lowering price part of it i 
FgtGg2-4S5M,631440,634880,don't think that's going to happen because they've been very consistent 
FgtGg2-4S5M,634880,638320,with the options and the prices they give people and the only way they would 
FgtGg2-4S5M,638320,642800,want to change it is if people stop buying macbooks but people are buying 
FgtGg2-4S5M,642800,646959,these apple silicon macbooks like crazy and switching over from windows systems 
FgtGg2-4S5M,646960,651200,and they're willing to pay that price to get all the other amazing benefits that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,651200,655840,they offer you guys let me know your thoughts down below what you think about 
FgtGg2-4S5M,655840,660000,this whole situation check out some of those ram comparisons right over there 
FgtGg2-4S5M,660000,663440,to show you how powerful apple's unified memory is how efficient it is click

FgtGg2-4S5M,306640,313360,and then we have their brand new xps 13 plus which is very impressive now right 
FgtGg2-4S5M,313360,319120,out of the get-go their price tag is actually higher than the new m2 macbook 
FgtGg2-4S5M,319120,325040,pro and air and it does come with a much worse screen slower processor but they 
FgtGg2-4S5M,325040,330960,do give you 512 gigs of ssd out of the box you still get 8 gigs of ram but 
FgtGg2-4S5M,330960,336720,instead of costing you 200 to upgrade like with max and apple it only costs 
FgtGg2-4S5M,336720,337840,you 100 
FgtGg2-4S5M,338960,344639,to make that jump that is excellent and it is new fast ram and then as far as 
FgtGg2-4S5M,344640,352480,the ssds to upgrade a one terabyte it is another 100 jump not a 200 jump that it 
FgtGg2-4S5M,352480,359360,costs you with apple's macbooks now not only is it cheaper it is actually better 
FgtGg2-4S5M,359360,365840,first off that ssd is actually removable so you can upgrade it yourself 
FgtGg2-4S5M,366400,372080,but with that you wouldn't really want to because look at these speeds we have 
FgtGg2-4S5M,372080,378560,5 000 megabytes per second right compared to 2900 on the macbook and 6 
FgtGg2-4S5M,379280,386000,700 read compared to 2825 that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,386000,390320,incredible and that just shows you what they could do when they have a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,390320,392480,little slot on their macbook you just buy market 
FgtGg2-4S5M,393120,399120,ssds for great prices and then of course apple is soldering theirs in so that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,399120,404160,incredible now of course this laptop they did some really weird things uh 
FgtGg2-4S5M,404160,407840,like not even giving you a headphone jack you can get an adapter that'll ship 
FgtGg2-4S5M,407840,412160,separately to you and you only have two ports and of course i have a touch bar 
FgtGg2-4S5M,412160,415280,thing i'm still very excited to check this thing out 
FgtGg2-4S5M,416000,420000,if you guys want to see a comparison hit that subscribe button down below 
FgtGg2-4S5M,420560,425200,because we will be comparing it but it's still cool to see a good value and a 
FgtGg2-4S5M,425200,429600,company is trying to be competitive and giving you these kind of prices now 
FgtGg2-4S5M,429600,435040,of course with that with apple's ram it's not the same as ram on these 
FgtGg2-4S5M,435040,438960,machines that is unified they have to build it into the chip itself so that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,438960,443600,makes that more expensive and you don't need as much ram as you do with the 
FgtGg2-4S5M,443600,447840,windows system we actually have done comparisons showing how we're comparing 
FgtGg2-4S5M,447840,453919,8 gigs to 16 comparing intel to apple silicon windows and mac showing you that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,453920,459200,8 gigs performs much closer to 16 when you had that in the past without unified 
FgtGg2-4S5M,459200,462080,memory because you have a lot less duplication 
FgtGg2-4S5M,462640,467360,that is used for graphics it's a lot more optimized so even though it costs 
FgtGg2-4S5M,467360,470400,more money they're using it with a different process you don't need to 
FgtGg2-4S5M,470400,476479,upgrade uh and get as much as you did previously for most tasks so as far as 
FgtGg2-4S5M,476480,481040,apple robbing people i mean some of these prices are crazy 
FgtGg2-4S5M,481040,484640,paying 200 bucks for 128 gig of extra storage 
FgtGg2-4S5M,485200,488880,it's too much definitely too much we tell a lot of you guys buy an external 
FgtGg2-4S5M,488880,493280,ssd we've showed off the savings many times works with thunderbolt and usbc 
FgtGg2-4S5M,493280,497200,you can plug it into any computer you can keep it with you if you upgrade your 
FgtGg2-4S5M,497200,501040,mac that's what i would suggest for you guys and as far as their ram 
FgtGg2-4S5M,501680,505759,it is expensive but you don't need as much as you think make sure you guys 
FgtGg2-4S5M,505760,509520,check out these those other videos that i talked about now what i do think 
FgtGg2-4S5M,509520,513599,they're robbing people with are their other devices not the macbooks but the 
FgtGg2-4S5M,513599,517120,ipads for example the ipad air this is just 
FgtGg2-4S5M,517680,520880,crazy if 64 gigs at the base that's not enough 
FgtGg2-4S5M,520880,524640,for most people if you're gonna be really using this device but they just 
FgtGg2-4S5M,524640,529280,skipped out the 128 gig option that they let you get on other devices and you 
FgtGg2-4S5M,529280,533680,have to spend 150 bucks to jump up to 256 which of course gets you really 
FgtGg2-4S5M,533680,540080,close to the ipad pro once again getting you to spend more money now with this 
FgtGg2-4S5M,540080,543520,external options with external disease aren't as useful it's a much more 
FgtGg2-4S5M,543520,547200,portable device and there's other issues that i talked about in my ipad os 16 
FgtGg2-4S5M,547200,553760,video now for the ipad pro it gets even worse and i think completely unexcusable 
FgtGg2-4S5M,553760,557360,if you want to have a good amount of storage to use as a pro device for media 
FgtGg2-4S5M,557360,562320,editing you might want to get one terabyte of storage but as you see it 
FgtGg2-4S5M,562320,567920,cost you 400 bucks to go from 512 to one terabyte that is 
FgtGg2-4S5M,567920,574000,insane where at the same time for 75 bucks you can get uh one m.2 stick like 
FgtGg2-4S5M,574000,579440,i showed you the samsung for 500 gigs now that is because not only are they 
FgtGg2-4S5M,579440,584560,charging you these kind of outrageous prices but they're locking in a 16 gig 
FgtGg2-4S5M,584560,590640,ram upgrade with that capacity as well so if you don't need the ram and now we 
FgtGg2-4S5M,590640,594640,know ipad os 16 will use swap so you don't need that extra ram 
FgtGg2-4S5M,595200,599920,uh but you do want more storage you're out of luck you have to get it or vice 
FgtGg2-4S5M,599920,605360,versa where the same exact m1 chip in a macbook air you can choose the storage 
FgtGg2-4S5M,605360,610480,or the ram even if the ram is built in so this is how apple is robbing people 
FgtGg2-4S5M,611040,617839,of their money forcing them to buy options that they might not even need so 
FgtGg2-4S5M,617840,623680,that is my perspective i hope that apple at least upgrades and puts better ssds 
FgtGg2-4S5M,623680,626000,in some of these devices when they're charging this much money 
FgtGg2-4S5M,626640,631440,and overall wants to lower their prices but the lowering price part of it i 
FgtGg2-4S5M,631440,634880,don't think that's going to happen because they've been very consistent 
FgtGg2-4S5M,634880,638320,with the options and the prices they give people and the only way they would 
FgtGg2-4S5M,638320,642800,want to change it is if people stop buying macbooks but people are buying 
FgtGg2-4S5M,642800,646959,these apple silicon macbooks like crazy and switching over from windows systems 
FgtGg2-4S5M,646960,651200,and they're willing to pay that price to get all the other amazing benefits that 
FgtGg2-4S5M,651200,655840,they offer you guys let me know your thoughts down below what you think about 
FgtGg2-4S5M,655840,660000,this whole situation check out some of those ram comparisons right over there 
FgtGg2-4S5M,660000,663440,to show you how powerful apple's unified memory is how efficient it is click
