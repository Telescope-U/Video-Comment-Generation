VF4YM5Dw33s,480,2560,g7 leaders meeting in southern germany
VF4YM5Dw33s,2560,4319,have agreed to invest hundreds of
VF4YM5Dw33s,4319,5839,billions of dollars in global
VF4YM5Dw33s,5839,8080,infrastructure the move aims to help
VF4YM5Dw33s,8080,10480,developing countries and counter china's
VF4YM5Dw33s,10480,12559,drive to exert influence in emerging
VF4YM5Dw33s,12559,14160,economies through large-scale
VF4YM5Dw33s,14160,16400,investments but it's russia's war in
VF4YM5Dw33s,16400,18480,ukraine that's dominating the three-day
VF4YM5Dw33s,18480,20240,meeting of the world's seven richest
VF4YM5Dw33s,20240,22560,democracies including the global
VF4YM5Dw33s,22560,26400,economic impact of moscow's invasion
VF4YM5Dw33s,26560,28160,they are meeting in the tranquil
VF4YM5Dw33s,28160,30880,surroundings of the bavarian alps
VF4YM5Dw33s,30880,33040,the top of the agenda is of course the
VF4YM5Dw33s,33040,38079,war in ukraine and the worldwide fallout
VF4YM5Dw33s,38320,40559,we've just tried to overcome a global
VF4YM5Dw33s,40559,44239,pandemic and it shook the global economy
VF4YM5Dw33s,44239,46879,and then as the global economy was just
VF4YM5Dw33s,46879,48079,recovering
VF4YM5Dw33s,48079,50160,russia's vicious attack on ukraine
VF4YM5Dw33s,50160,51440,happened
VF4YM5Dw33s,51440,53199,driving prices up
VF4YM5Dw33s,53199,55760,everywhere from food to energy
VF4YM5Dw33s,55760,58399,and casting deep uncertainty
VF4YM5Dw33s,58399,62000,especially in the most fragile countries
VF4YM5Dw33s,62000,65360,as host german chancellor olaf schultz
VF4YM5Dw33s,65360,67439,says the world is facing economic
VF4YM5Dw33s,67439,70159,difficulties just as big as the problems
VF4YM5Dw33s,70159,73600,of the 1970s when the g7 was starting
VF4YM5Dw33s,73600,75920,out
VF4YM5Dw33s,76000,79119,falling growth rates rising inflation
VF4YM5Dw33s,79119,81600,raw material shortages and supply chain
VF4YM5Dw33s,81600,83600,disruptions these are no small
VF4YM5Dw33s,83600,85520,challenges and we must share the
VF4YM5Dw33s,85520,87840,responsibility
VF4YM5Dw33s,87840,90960,u.s president joe biden announced a 600
VF4YM5Dw33s,90960,94159,billion dollar g7 initiative to boost
VF4YM5Dw33s,94159,96880,infrastructure in developing countries
VF4YM5Dw33s,96880,99200,with the aim of countering china's
VF4YM5Dw33s,99200,101439,growing global influence
VF4YM5Dw33s,101439,103280,but developing countries often lack the
VF4YM5Dw33s,103280,105360,essential infrastructure to help
VF4YM5Dw33s,105360,108880,navigate global shocks like a pandemic
VF4YM5Dw33s,108880,111520,so they feel the impacts more acutely
VF4YM5Dw33s,111520,114640,and they have a harder time recovering
VF4YM5Dw33s,114640,116799,in our deeply connected world
VF4YM5Dw33s,116799,119680,that's not just a humanitarian concern
VF4YM5Dw33s,119680,122399,it's an economic and a security concern
VF4YM5Dw33s,122399,124799,for all of us
VF4YM5Dw33s,124799,127520,tight security has so far prevented any
VF4YM5Dw33s,127520,130239,unrest at the summit but protesters have
VF4YM5Dw33s,130239,132080,gathered on the fringes
VF4YM5Dw33s,132080,134480,mainly climate change campaigners and
VF4YM5Dw33s,134480,137040,activists opposing germany's plans for a
VF4YM5Dw33s,137040,140319,big rise in defence spending
VF4YM5Dw33s,140319,141920,the leaders are considering more
VF4YM5Dw33s,141920,144080,measures to punish russia for the war in
VF4YM5Dw33s,144080,147360,ukraine the u.s canada japan and britain
VF4YM5Dw33s,147360,149440,have all announced a ban on imports of
VF4YM5Dw33s,149440,152160,russian gold the overall message is one
VF4YM5Dw33s,152160,156400,of unity in the face of aggression
VF4YM5Dw33s,156400,157680,let's cross over to our political
VF4YM5Dw33s,157680,159599,correspondent julia saldelli she's in
VF4YM5Dw33s,159599,162800,garmisch-potten near the summit venue
VF4YM5Dw33s,162800,164959,julia ukraine's president is expected to
VF4YM5Dw33s,164959,167040,address the g7 meeting there today are
VF4YM5Dw33s,167040,169599,the leaders gathered there united in
VF4YM5Dw33s,169599,173360,their approach to the war in ukraine
VF4YM5Dw33s,174480,176480,yes unity is the message that the
VF4YM5Dw33s,176480,178640,leaders here have been wanting to to
VF4YM5Dw33s,178640,181840,portray uh already yesterday but also
VF4YM5Dw33s,181840,183440,today when they're going to speak to
VF4YM5Dw33s,183440,185599,ukrainian president zielenski
VF4YM5Dw33s,185599,188640,they are united in criticizing russia
VF4YM5Dw33s,188640,191120,for its attack against ukraine which has
VF4YM5Dw33s,191120,194319,been defined as a brutal or uh
VF4YM5Dw33s,194319,196720,other similar adjectives that are have
VF4YM5Dw33s,196720,198720,been really critical against russia but
VF4YM5Dw33s,198720,201440,also in their support towards ukraine
VF4YM5Dw33s,201440,203760,and uh they are trying to shore the
VF4YM5Dw33s,203760,206400,support not only with words but also
VF4YM5Dw33s,206400,208560,with practical plans for example there
VF4YM5Dw33s,208560,211120,are discussions about possibly
VF4YM5Dw33s,211120,214080,implementing a ban on gold imports from
VF4YM5Dw33s,214080,215120,russia
VF4YM5Dw33s,215120,216640,gold imports that are a big source of
VF4YM5Dw33s,216640,219040,income from russia and are mostly
VF4YM5Dw33s,219040,222159,exported to g7 countries but also there
VF4YM5Dw33s,222159,224879,are talks about implementing a price cap
VF4YM5Dw33s,224879,225680,on
VF4YM5Dw33s,225680,227760,oil exports from russia and these are
VF4YM5Dw33s,227760,229920,all things that the leaders may want to
VF4YM5Dw33s,229920,232000,present to zelensky today and they
VF4YM5Dw33s,232000,233599,really want to show the ukrainian
VF4YM5Dw33s,233599,235680,president that the g7 countries are
VF4YM5Dw33s,235680,238640,there also in the long term
VF4YM5Dw33s,238640,240799,now helping the world deal with climate
VF4YM5Dw33s,240799,243599,change is another major topic for the g7
VF4YM5Dw33s,243599,245680,that's been the case in the past as well
VF4YM5Dw33s,245680,247360,how are the leaders there approaching
VF4YM5Dw33s,247360,249680,that
VF4YM5Dw33s,251200,252959,climate change has taken a bit of a back
VF4YM5Dw33s,252959,255120,seat now that the war in ukraine has
VF4YM5Dw33s,255120,257759,been the dominating topic at the g7 but
VF4YM5Dw33s,257759,259759,we shouldn't forget that climate change
VF4YM5Dw33s,259759,262320,is actually connected in some way to
VF4YM5Dw33s,262320,264560,russia's aggression in ukraine because a
VF4YM5Dw33s,264560,266639,lot of g7 countries now have the urgent
VF4YM5Dw33s,266639,268479,need to make themselves independent of
VF4YM5Dw33s,268479,270320,russian fossil fuels and they have to do
VF4YM5Dw33s,270320,272160,that quickly and it is an opportunity
VF4YM5Dw33s,272160,274960,for them to actually pursue uh faster
VF4YM5Dw33s,274960,276960,and bigger development of renewable
VF4YM5Dw33s,276960,279120,energies in in the future and that is
VF4YM5Dw33s,279120,280720,something that chancellor olaf schultz
VF4YM5Dw33s,280720,283120,also wants to bring home he has a plan
VF4YM5Dw33s,283120,285520,he has an idea to create a climate club
VF4YM5Dw33s,285520,287600,of willing countries who can be an
VF4YM5Dw33s,287600,290400,example and show leadership in terms of
VF4YM5Dw33s,290400,292320,building up renewable energy and
VF4YM5Dw33s,292320,294479,promoting sustainability and that is
VF4YM5Dw33s,294479,296000,something that is also really on the
VF4YM5Dw33s,296000,298639,minds of the protesters here at g7
VF4YM5Dw33s,298639,300960,climate has been one of the main topics
VF4YM5Dw33s,300960,302960,i spoke to many of them and they really
VF4YM5Dw33s,302960,305520,want the g7 to take concrete and fast
VF4YM5Dw33s,305520,307919,action in fighting climate change
VF4YM5Dw33s,307919,309199,julia thank you so much our
VF4YM5Dw33s,309199,311440,correspondent julia saudelli there in
VF4YM5Dw33s,311440,314320,garnish pardon care
VF4YM5Dw33s,315600,316960,for some more analysis let's bring in
VF4YM5Dw33s,316960,318960,stefan meister here he's head of the
VF4YM5Dw33s,318960,320479,program on international order and
VF4YM5Dw33s,320479,322160,democracy at the german council on
VF4YM5Dw33s,322160,324240,foreign relations stefan thanks for
VF4YM5Dw33s,324240,326479,being with us what do you make of the
VF4YM5Dw33s,326479,329360,proposals put forth by g7 leaders for
VF4YM5Dw33s,329360,331360,countering russian aggression in ukraine
VF4YM5Dw33s,331360,333680,and softening the economic fallout from
VF4YM5Dw33s,333680,336080,the war
VF4YM5Dw33s,337360,339039,i think we have reached a limit of
VF4YM5Dw33s,339039,341520,sanctions um from the from the western
VF4YM5Dw33s,341520,344320,side so now we are discussing gold uh i
VF4YM5Dw33s,344320,346400,think which which will have an impact on
VF4YM5Dw33s,346400,348960,the russian economy but as long as
VF4YM5Dw33s,348960,352800,russia still can sell sale oil and gas
VF4YM5Dw33s,352800,355280,globally as long as india and china and
VF4YM5Dw33s,355280,357680,other big countries are
VF4YM5Dw33s,357680,360319,buying russian gas and the russian even
VF4YM5Dw33s,360319,362639,the russian welfare fund is growing
VF4YM5Dw33s,362639,364960,i don't see that putin will will make
VF4YM5Dw33s,364960,366880,here any any compromise i think he will
VF4YM5Dw33s,366880,369120,not make any compromises anyway because
VF4YM5Dw33s,369120,371360,he wants ukraine to get under control
VF4YM5Dw33s,371360,374000,but i think i i think this is first of
VF4YM5Dw33s,374000,376560,all about unity this this summit but i i
VF4YM5Dw33s,376560,378560,don't think it will change uh russian
VF4YM5Dw33s,378560,380720,policy at the moment
VF4YM5Dw33s,380720,383759,the war in ukraine stefan is a defining
VF4YM5Dw33s,383759,386319,moment for the west which the g7
VF4YM5Dw33s,386319,388960,embodies to some degree how severely do
VF4YM5Dw33s,388960,390960,you see the west's influence in the
VF4YM5Dw33s,390960,393280,world being tested as a consequence of
VF4YM5Dw33s,393280,395840,this war
VF4YM5Dw33s,396319,398560,i think it is impressive how united
VF4YM5Dw33s,398560,400720,western countries are
VF4YM5Dw33s,400720,403680,g7 is somehow back yeah it was a it was
VF4YM5Dw33s,403680,406560,a declining format but i think western
VF4YM5Dw33s,406560,408720,democracies understand that they have to
VF4YM5Dw33s,408720,411120,coordinate and to cooperate more in the
VF4YM5Dw33s,411120,413280,light of the russian war at the same
VF4YM5Dw33s,413280,415680,time we can also see the limits we can
VF4YM5Dw33s,415680,418160,see that other countries like india like
VF4YM5Dw33s,418160,421199,china but also brazil south africa they
VF4YM5Dw33s,421199,423360,do not follow western countries on
VF4YM5Dw33s,423360,425039,sanctions
VF4YM5Dw33s,425039,428080,so we see a changing order
VF4YM5Dw33s,428080,430800,which is neither unipolan or bipolar
VF4YM5Dw33s,430800,432479,it's multipolar
VF4YM5Dw33s,432479,434479,and yeah and we can we can see that but
VF4YM5Dw33s,434479,436160,other major countries neither follow
VF4YM5Dw33s,436160,439840,russia nor follow the g7
VF4YM5Dw33s,439840,442639,you mentioned uh india and south africa
VF4YM5Dw33s,442639,444560,they're among a number of other
VF4YM5Dw33s,444560,446639,countries including indonesia and
VF4YM5Dw33s,446639,449199,senegal that have been invited to attend
VF4YM5Dw33s,449199,450800,the g7 this year
VF4YM5Dw33s,450800,453120,they are represented there what role are
VF4YM5Dw33s,453120,457120,those countries playing at that g7
VF4YM5Dw33s,458000,460160,i think g7 understand that they have to
VF4YM5Dw33s,460160,462800,engage with these countries
VF4YM5Dw33s,462800,465680,there is a growing axis or you can call
VF4YM5Dw33s,465680,467919,it between china and and russia as
VF4YM5Dw33s,467919,470720,authoritarian states uh and you have
VF4YM5Dw33s,470720,472240,countries like india which are
VF4YM5Dw33s,472240,473840,democracies but you also have other
VF4YM5Dw33s,473840,475680,countries who are
VF4YM5Dw33s,475680,476639,partly
VF4YM5Dw33s,476639,479599,democracies i think there is a growing
VF4YM5Dw33s,479599,481520,understanding that you have to engage
VF4YM5Dw33s,481520,484560,with major asian african and south
VF4YM5Dw33s,484560,486720,american countries as
VF4YM5Dw33s,486720,490720,g7 as western countries to um yeah to to
VF4YM5Dw33s,490720,492960,react to to challenges in in the global
VF4YM5Dw33s,492960,495759,world and that they need a place also on
VF4YM5Dw33s,495759,498160,the table to discuss major challenges
VF4YM5Dw33s,498160,500400,like the russian war in in ukraine and
VF4YM5Dw33s,500400,502400,the consequences of this war for global
VF4YM5Dw33s,502400,505199,economy and and food security
VF4YM5Dw33s,505199,507240,you said that you see a
VF4YM5Dw33s,507240,510240,multi-polar world emerging
VF4YM5Dw33s,510240,511680,where do you see
VF4YM5Dw33s,511680,514000,the the west particularly the united
VF4YM5Dw33s,514000,516399,states and europe has it their
VF4YM5Dw33s,516399,518320,importance been being is it being
VF4YM5Dw33s,518320,520719,diminished in this multi-polar world
VF4YM5Dw33s,520719,523599,that you see emerging
VF4YM5Dw33s,524000,526240,so it's the end of the u.s unipolar
VF4YM5Dw33s,526240,529120,world that means it is a decline also of
VF4YM5Dw33s,529120,532160,u.s power in global politics
VF4YM5Dw33s,532160,535279,europeans have to invest in in security
VF4YM5Dw33s,535279,537360,they have to become more independent
VF4YM5Dw33s,537360,539600,more more autonomous also on security
VF4YM5Dw33s,539600,542240,issues from the us who is not able and
VF4YM5Dw33s,542240,544399,willing anymore to to play the the
VF4YM5Dw33s,544399,546320,global police um
VF4YM5Dw33s,546320,549040,so you can say in the end this war
VF4YM5Dw33s,549040,551600,um strengthened g7 strengthen western
VF4YM5Dw33s,551600,553920,democracies in their cooperation but it
VF4YM5Dw33s,553920,556080,has shown also the limits of these
VF4YM5Dw33s,556080,558959,countries um and we can see that other
VF4YM5Dw33s,558959,562080,major players like china india indonesia
VF4YM5Dw33s,562080,564160,are becoming more important so you are
VF4YM5Dw33s,564160,566480,you can argue it's it's a diminishing of
VF4YM5Dw33s,566480,568720,western powers but at the same time if
VF4YM5Dw33s,568720,571440,they are united they are still strong
VF4YM5Dw33s,571440,573839,and they can make a difference
VF4YM5Dw33s,573839,575279,stefan thank you very much for talking
VF4YM5Dw33s,575279,576560,with us out with stephen meister from
VF4YM5Dw33s,576560,578240,the german council on foreign relations
VF4YM5Dw33s,578240,580399,here in berlin
