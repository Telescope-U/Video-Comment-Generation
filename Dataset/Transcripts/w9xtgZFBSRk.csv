w9xtgZFBSRk,945544,952618,>> Reporter: ONE OTHER THING  THAT THE WOMEN AGREED UPON IS   THAT'S THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE   SUPPORT FOR WOMEN FROM THE TIME   THAT THEY ARE PREGNANT THROUGH
w9xtgZFBSRk,952618,958724,CHILDCARE AND DAY CARE AND K-12   EDUCATION.  THEY BELIEVE THERE HAS NOT BEEN

w9xtgZFBSRk,1033965,1041873,"NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE  ABORTIONS THEY SEEK.  IN THE POLITICAL ARTICLE, I   WROTE ABOUT MY TWO GRANDMOTHERS   WHO BOTH BECAME PREGNANT BEFORE "
w9xtgZFBSRk,1041873,1047444,ROE V. WADE.  ONE OF THEM TRAVELED TO PUERTO  RICO AND GOT AN ILLEGAL   ABORTION AND THE OTHER ONE  CARRIED THE PREGNANCY TO TERM

w9xtgZFBSRk,1056989,1062427,RELATED TO WHAT WE FIND MANY  YEARS LATER WHEN WE HAD THE   LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF WOMEN   SEEKING ABORTIONS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY.  PEOPLE WHO BECOME PREGNANT WHEN 
w9xtgZFBSRk,1062427,1068000,THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE AND  CARRY THE PREGNANCY TO TERM   EXPERIENCE SERIOUS PHYSICAL 
w9xtgZFBSRk,1068000,1074206,HEALTH HARDSHIP AND ADOPTION IS   NOT AN EASY SOLUTION. 
w9xtgZFBSRk,1074206,1081480,IT IS NOT A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO  THE PROBLEM.  THE OTHER GRANDMOTHER WHO HAD   AN ILLEGAL ABORTION MANAGED TO
w9xtgZFBSRk,1081480,1089021,DO IT SAFELY IN PUERTO RICO AND   I THINK MANY PEOPLE WILL BE 47
w9xtgZFBSRk,1089021,1109975,ILLEGAL ABORTIONS. BUT I THINK
w9xtgZFBSRk,1109975,1115080,WHAT WE OVERLOOK IS VERY  SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE   WHO ARE PREGNANT WHO DO NOT   WANT TO BE PREGNANT.  THEY JUST FEEL THAT THEY CAN
w9xtgZFBSRk,1115080,1120819,AFFORD TO HAVE A CHILD AND  THEY'RE FORCED TO CARRY THAT  PREGNANCY TO TERM.  >> BASED ON WHAT YOU LEARNED  AND WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS FOR

w9xtgZFBSRk,1142040,1148113,"ONLINE AND IF THEY GET THE  RIGHT PILLS AND GET FOLLOW-UP   CARE, THEY WILL BE FINE, BUT IF   THEY DON'T, THERE CERTAINLY   COULD BE COMPLICATIONS THAT "
w9xtgZFBSRk,1148113,1156722,"WOULD BE VERY SCARY.  AND THEN MANY PEOPLE WILL CARRY   THE PREGNANCY TO TERM AND THOSE   PEOPLE, MAYBE THAT IS SEEN AS A "

w9xtgZFBSRk,1162761,1170802,"FOUND IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE   DENIED AN ABORTION AND CARRY  THE PREGNANCY TO TERM, THEY   EXPERIENCE YEARS OF PHYSICAL, "
