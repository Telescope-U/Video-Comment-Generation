pLe_2gYwdFk,298998,299932,THE PASSING.
pLe_2gYwdFk,299932,302502,HE HAD EIGHT ASSISTS.
pLe_2gYwdFk,302502,305237,"HE WAS STILL PENETRATING, HE HAD"
pLe_2gYwdFk,305237,308207,A COUPLE OF OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS.

pLe_2gYwdFk,406171,409442,>> THIS IS THE BIG-TIME FINALS
pLe_2gYwdFk,409442,410442,MOMENT THAT THE PEOPLE WERE
pLe_2gYwdFk,410442,412645,WANTING TO SEE FROM STEPH CURRY.
pLe_2gYwdFk,412645,413312,WE ALL SAID STEPH CURRY HAD
pLe_2gYwdFk,413312,414814,NOTHING TO PROVE.
pLe_2gYwdFk,414814,418050,"BUT TO HUSH UP THE NAYSAYERS,"
pLe_2gYwdFk,418050,418817,"THE DOUBTERS, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE"

pLe_2gYwdFk,420786,422054,"GAME, STEPH HAS NOT HAD THAT BIG"
pLe_2gYwdFk,422054,422922,FINALS MOMENT.
pLe_2gYwdFk,422922,425558,THIS WAS THAT BIG FINALS MOMENT.
pLe_2gYwdFk,425558,427293,THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO GO DOWN
pLe_2gYwdFk,427293,427727,3-1.
pLe_2gYwdFk,427727,429028,HE IS PLAYING AT LESS THAN 100%.
pLe_2gYwdFk,429028,430630,HE IS CLEARLY A LITTLE BIT HURT.
pLe_2gYwdFk,430630,433966,HE GAVE IT EVERYTHING ON ONE
pLe_2gYwdFk,433966,434801,"DAYS REST, ALREADY HEARD THE"

pLe_2gYwdFk,442041,442708,BIG-TIME SHOT AFTER BIG-TIME
pLe_2gYwdFk,442708,444444,SHOT.
pLe_2gYwdFk,444444,445544,THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE
pLe_2gYwdFk,445544,447646,THAT CRITICIZE STEPH CURRY HAVE
pLe_2gYwdFk,447646,449482,TO BE QUIET ABOUT TONIGHT
pLe_2gYwdFk,449482,450182,BECAUSE HE HUSHED UP A LOT OF
pLe_2gYwdFk,450182,451384,DOUBTERS.
pLe_2gYwdFk,451384,452484,A LOT OF TALKING HEADS THAT TALK
pLe_2gYwdFk,452484,456889,"THAT SMACK, IN I DO NOT LIKE IT"
pLe_2gYwdFk,456889,457623,WHEN THEY DISRESPECT STEPH CURRY
pLe_2gYwdFk,457623,458290,AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN IN THE
pLe_2gYwdFk,458290,458658,FINALS.
pLe_2gYwdFk,458658,459392,THIS WAS AN ICONIC PERFORMANCE.
pLe_2gYwdFk,459392,462662,KRISTEN: IT'S FUNNY YOU SAY THAT
pLe_2gYwdFk,462662,464630,"BECAUSE ZEKE, YOU SAID EARLIER"
pLe_2gYwdFk,464630,466431,TODAY THAT EVEN 50% OF STEPH

pLe_2gYwdFk,467332,467799,OF ANYBODY ELSE.
pLe_2gYwdFk,467799,472238,">> I MEAN, IT'S STEPH CURRY."
pLe_2gYwdFk,472238,472938,BECAUSE NOT ONLY WHAT HE DOES
pLe_2gYwdFk,472938,475040,"SHOOTING THE BASKETBALL, BUT HOW"
pLe_2gYwdFk,475040,477243,MUCH ATTENTION HE DRAWS.
pLe_2gYwdFk,477243,478276,AND THEN HIS CONFIDENCE THAT HE
pLe_2gYwdFk,478276,481113,BRINGS TO THE FLOOR ALLOWS OTHER
pLe_2gYwdFk,481113,482048,PLAYERS TO BE CONFIDENT.
