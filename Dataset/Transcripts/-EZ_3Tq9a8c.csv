-EZ_3Tq9a8c,2702,3613,"- All right, what's up, I'm Marques here,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,3613,5180,welcome back to Dope Tech.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,5180,9719,"And yes, this is an Xbox Series S, fully portable,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,9720,12040,in the shape of a laptop
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,12040,14260,with a display on it and everything.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,14260,16400,This is sent to be by the creators of the xScreen
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,16400,19900,"And for a certain group of people, this is really cool."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,19900,21550,"So obviously, hand-held gaming's having a bit"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,21550,22383,of a moment right now.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,22383,25010,I am also currently testing this little guy
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,25010,26960,called the Valve Steam Deck.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,26960,28609,You might have heard about it.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,28610,30610,Leave a thumbs-up if you're excited for that video.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,30610,34060,"But this thing, well this is exactly what it looks like."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,34060,36550,It's called the xScreen for Xbox Series S
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,36550,38620,and it basically turns the console
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,38620,41360,into a laptop form factor for you hardcore gamers
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,41360,45270,that wanna play Xbox games but not just on the couch.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,45270,46880,"So basically, all you have to do is plug it in"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,46880,50330,by connecting this piece to the Xbox like a puzzle piece.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,50330,53610,It has a USB plug and an HDMI plug in the back.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,53610,55400,And you plug them in to align the whole thing up
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,55400,57380,"and there's two, bonus, little thumb-screws,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,57380,60330,one on either side to help hold everything in place.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,60330,62020,"And then you use, literally, the original cable"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,62020,64030,"that came with the Xbox and then boom,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,64030,66170,"the whole thing can light up just like this,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,66170,69360,the screen turns on and you're gamin' on the go.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,69360,71890,"Now this screen, it's not the highest end screen"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,71890,73250,in the world on paper.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,73250,76360,"Like, the numbers, it's an 11.6-inch diagonal screen"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,76360,79890,"and it's 1080p, it's an IPS at 60Hz, right?"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,79890,83620,"But it matches the size of the Xbox, obviously,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,83620,84860,to achieve this form factor.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,84860,87100,"And then if you think about it, 1080p right,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,87100,89640,"so that this screen, you might be already gaming on"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,89640,91580,for a console like this is 1080p
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,91580,94560,"but this is obviously way smaller, so it's actually"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,94560,97240,"significantly sharper, the higher pixel density,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,97240,100950,"and so you can sit much closer to it like I am, here."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,100950,102369,And so it's really just about convenience
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,102370,103710,to match the size of the Xbox.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,103710,105340,It's got the stereo speakers up top.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,105340,107240,It also has an optional stand mode
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,107240,108820,to help you get a better angle.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,108820,110870,And it's got a cross-hair mode to help you better aim
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,110870,112580,"in shooter games, if you're into that."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,112580,114390,You basically just have to plug it in
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,114390,116130,"and light it up, and it starts gaming."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,116130,119360,"So yeah, it's not a 4K or 120Hz screen"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,119360,121920,"or anything like that, but I wasn't really expecting"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,121920,125030,that much from something that plugs directly into an Xbox.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,125030,127430,"And you know what, it still does have this nice matte finish"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,127430,129410,which makes it easy to see in a variety
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,129410,131410,of lighting situations it might face.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,131410,133540,The audio gets surprisingly loud.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,133540,136299,"Honestly, it's easy to have a lot of fun playing this"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,136300,138570,almost anywhere that you could fit a normal
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,138570,141160,or super thick gaming laptop.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,141160,143480,"Well, except for the fact that you do pretty much"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,143480,144900,always need to be plugged in.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,144900,147769,I did see a video on the Creators YouTube channel
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,147770,150730,where they have this massive 99-watt-hour battery
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,150730,154409,"and so you could, in theory, bring it and the battery"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,154410,158440,"on a flight, you know, get that seat back tray table goin',"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,158440,160310,but it lasts about 40 minutes.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,160310,163020,"So if you have the seat on a plane with no outlet,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,163020,164160,this isn't exactly great.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,164160,167120,"But overall, you know, aside from the rear USB"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,167120,169000,"and ethernet ports being blocked,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,169000,172110,and the white color not quite exactly matching up
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,172110,175560,"the same as the Xbox plastic, but being really close,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,175560,178660,this thing is really well built and it's 250 bucks
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,178660,179710,for the whole kit.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,179710,181910,So it's on Kickstarter right now.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,181910,183610,That's basically the same price
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,183610,185730,as the Xbox Series S is going for.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,185730,187099,"It's a little bit pricey, but I'll say"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,187100,189150,if you have the outlet in the back of your car
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,189150,191810,and you want to play Xbox games on the go
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,191810,193700,"like this is, yeah, this is the best way"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,193700,194890,to actually do that.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,194890,197940,"Until maybe, of course, Tesla finally ships"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,197940,200740,that gaming feature they've been promising for so long.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,200740,202990,"So overall, I'm gonna give this seven out of 10."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,202990,205350,If it's actually shipping and people are playing Xbox games
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,205350,207540,"on the go, that's pretty dope."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,207540,209670,"All right, these might be the strangest"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,209670,213099,but coolest earbuds design I've ever seen.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,213100,215610,These are called Sony LinkBuds.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,215610,216990,"They're brand new, you might have seen me tweet"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,216990,218370,about them the other day.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,218370,222000,"And right away, you can tell they're pretty different"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,222000,223020,from normal earbuds.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,223020,223890,You're seeing things correctly.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,223890,227569,"The earbud is a circle, the part that actually goes"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,227570,230170,into your ear is a circle.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,230170,231002,I'll explain.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,231003,232260,So a lotta headphones we use right now
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,232260,233959,have active noise cancellation
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,233960,236220,but then a separate feature that they started adding
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,236220,238270,"more and more often, which is some sort"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,238270,239540,of transparency mode.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,239540,241750,So it uses the microphones around the earbud
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,241750,243500,to pump in sound from the outside
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,243500,245000,so you can walk around on the streets
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,245000,246890,and still hear the cars around you
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,246890,249550,or hear when your bus or train stop gets called.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,249550,252690,"So these, well, these are designed so you can"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,252690,255360,always hear your environment around you
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,255360,256680,even when you're wearing them.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,256680,259430,So they have an 11-millimeter circular driver
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,259430,260650,and a hole in the middle.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,260650,263380,"So when you put the earbuds in, without playing any music"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,263380,267520,you can still hear a lot of the outside world around you.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,267520,269979,"Then when you play music, well, yeah,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,269980,271200,it sounds like the headphones are on
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,271200,272600,with the transparency mode.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,272600,275480,"Now, I found it's not actually as good"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,275480,278870,"as, say, AirPods Pro because those microphones are"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,278870,281310,"actually amplifying your environment,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,281310,283320,"so with these, if there's music playing,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,283320,285040,"you still hear a little bit of what's around you,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,285040,286730,but you can actually drown it out
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,286730,288060,if you turn the volume up loud enough.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,288060,290220,But I really have been impressed with how well
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,290220,291640,these actually work.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,291640,294590,"I mean, clearly the physics makes sense,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,294590,296970,"there's a hole through it, but yeah, now you're letting"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,296970,300810,in constantly a non-adjustable amount of sound
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,300810,302240,from the outside world.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,302240,305210,So it's great for listening to music
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,305210,308280,while cars are around you or on public transportation
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,308280,310110,so you can still hear when your bus stop gets called
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,310110,311349,or something like that.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,311350,312860,It's consistent.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,312860,314180,So then the idea with these is even
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,314180,316330,"when you're done using them, done listening to music"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,316330,318360,"or taking a phone call, or whatever it is you're doing,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,318360,319979,you can just leave them in your ears
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,319980,322480,"because you'll have transparency mode,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,322480,323970,you'll have the ability to hear what's going on
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,323970,326540,"around you all the time, even when the earbuds are in"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,326540,329990,and it doesn't take extra battery power to do that.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,329990,332099,So now you're just having a normal conversation.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,332100,333450,Now the other thing you may have noticed is
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,333450,335610,"these earbuds are pretty tiny,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,335610,337620,"like, the buds themselves are very small,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,337620,340470,"and the recycled plastic case they fit in, as a result is"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,340470,342300,also very pocket-able.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,342300,344650,But the down side is that there's no space
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,344650,348229,"on the buds, themselves, for media controls anywhere."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,348230,352240,But that's where the second crazy feature comes into play.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,352240,356650,You can adjust volume by tapping the skin
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,356650,358820,around your ears.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,358820,362440,So the Sony Connect app lets you program a double-tap
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,362440,365500,or a triple-tap of your own skull on the right
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,365500,368150,"or left-hand side, and these earbuds are sensitive enough"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,368150,370990,of their own position that you can map a double-tap
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,370990,373729,"on the right-hand side to be volume, a double-tap"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,373730,376670,on the left-hand side could be skipping tracks
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,376670,379600,or even opening Google Assistant or accepting a phone call.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,379600,380433,It's awesome.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,380433,381880,"Overall, as crazy as these are,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,381880,383620,they are surprising;y usable.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,383620,387430,"They're 179 bucks, small case, no wireless charging"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,387430,388870,"but it does have USB type C,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,388870,391560,and it gives you a five-hour total battery life with these.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,391560,394470,Sound quality is solid.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,394470,395980,"If anything, it's lacking a little bit of bass"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,395980,397770,'cause it's not getting into your ear
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,397770,399229,like normal earbuds might.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,399230,402250,"But yeah, if you can get the touch controls to work well,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,402250,404570,"they're finicky sometimes, so you gotta tap like,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,404570,407660,"right up next to your ear, they're pretty cool."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,407660,410070,I'm gonna give these an eight outta 10.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,410070,413160,"Okay, this next product I know is absolutely not meant"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,413160,415930,"for me, but I can still inspect it anyway."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,415930,420449,This is a super high end gaming tablet.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,420450,422390,And I just need you to know that this is real
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,422390,424280,and this is something that actually exists.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,424280,428610,So this is the Asus ROG Flow Z13.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,428610,433610,"This thing has an up to 14-core Intel Core i9 processor,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,434020,437280,"a GEForce RTX 3050-Ti graphics card,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,437280,442087,"a 1080p 120Hz display or a 4K, 60Hz option,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,443300,446860,up to one terabyte of M.2 SSD storage
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,446860,450469,and a vapor chamber cooling solution on the back.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,450470,454200,"So yes, it's a full-fledged gaming computer running Windows."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,454200,456010,You can think of it kinda like a Surface Pro
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,456010,458100,but just way more gaming focused.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,458100,461170,"Now, I can't imagine battery life will be killer"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,461170,462710,"on something like this most of the time,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,462710,465039,"but hey, gaming laptops don't typically have"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,465040,468807,"amazing battery life, either, so that's not a huge surprise."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,468807,471580,"I'm really into this design, though, the aesthetics"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,471580,473909,of how they managed to shove all that power
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,473910,476120,into a tablet-size package.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,476120,478010,"It's got some thickness to it, of course,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,478010,480460,"and it's definitely not lightweight,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,480460,482060,but it's a reasonable layout.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,482060,483760,There's a power button and volume rockers
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,483760,486040,"on the right side, along with a combo microphone"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,486040,488400,"headphone jack and a speaker at the bottom,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,488400,491080,and then there's a single USB type C Thunderbolt port
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,491080,494050,"on the left side, along with this labeled XGM port"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,494050,496949,which is gonna let you plug in different external GPUs.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,496950,498710,There's pins and magnets at the bottom
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,498710,501509,"for docking a keyboard accessory, just like the Surface,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,501510,504290,"and there's no ports up top, but just heat dissipation,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,504290,506300,"just heat sinks, heat radiating out the top."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,506300,507729,And look at that.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,507730,512419,"LEDs, PCB, and the angular cutout, and a kickstand."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,512419,514240,That is a really nice touch.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,514240,515880,"And I'm not just saying that 'cause it's red and black,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,515880,517860,"although that certainly helps, but they've made"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,517860,520579,as many clever incisions for ventilation
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,520580,523080,"and angular gamer aesthetic as possible,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,523080,524620,and they seem to have gotten away with it.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,524620,527839,Now the 3050-Ti isn't the highest end graphics card
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,527840,529060,"in the world, I get that."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,529060,531850,"If you wanna play ""The Witcher 3"" or ""Cyberpunk"""
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,531850,533100,"or something like that on high settings,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,533100,535290,"you're gonna need more power, probably something"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,535290,538120,"in a laptop form factor, but that's why this thing can plug"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,538120,541490,"into those external GPU attachments, the same stuff"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,541490,544089,that the ROG Flow thin and light laptop could plug
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,544090,546410,"into, 'cause this is meant to actually game on."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,546410,548730,You should definitely Dave2D's full video on it.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,548730,553110,He gets 120 fps on this tablet in overwatch.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,553110,555120,"It's a tablet, it's hilarious."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,555120,556360,I'll link it below.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,556360,558560,"So the thing is a tablet when you want it to be,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,558560,562279,but can plug into this ROG XG mobile graphics dock
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,562280,564430,which gives you up to an RTX 3080.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,564430,567470,"Basically, you're buying a gaming laptop in two parts,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,567470,568319,if that makes sense.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,568320,570010,But I keep coming back to everything I like
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,570010,572460,about just the back of this tablet.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,572460,576470,"The subtle texture of the metal, the rock-solid stand"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,576470,579720,"with this window cutout, and under the kickstand,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,579720,581839,"there's a bunch of outlines, giving you a peek"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,581840,585920,"at what's inside, so the M.2 SSD, the battery,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,585920,589190,"and of course, an opening to a micro SD card slot."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,589190,591080,There's also a set of coordinates on the back
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,591080,593040,"which, if you Google them, appears to direct you"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,593040,595130,to Asus' headquarters in Taiwan.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,595130,598960,"Best part though, they still included the camera"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,598960,600380,"on the back 'cause somewhere out there,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,600380,602970,"there's somebody who would spend a bunch of money,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,602970,604500,"there isn't even a price for this thing yet,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,604500,606250,"but a bunch of money, probably,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,606250,609690,"on a super high end gaming tablet,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,609690,612640,but still would take pictures with it.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,612640,615110,"Anyway, I'm giving this thing like, a nine outta 10"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,615110,616700,"just for the aesthetic, I'm a huge fan."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,616700,618150,"But then the last thing I wanna mention,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,618150,621700,this USB-C power cable with the display readout
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,621700,623580,on the end has been awesome.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,623580,624900,"So basically, ever since I showed it"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,624900,626860,"in my everyday carry video, I've been carrying it"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,626860,630390,"and it's low-key, just like nerdy fun to just be able"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,630390,631820,to plug in and see exactly what sort
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,631820,634630,of wattage you're getting from your charger on any device.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,634630,636380,"You know, we always talked about peak charging"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,636380,639210,"versus actually overall average charging rates,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,639210,641870,"and this is so obviously unnecessary and overkill,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,641870,643950,but being able to see exactly what type
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,643950,646180,"of power you're drawing at any given moment,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,646180,648880,"maybe it's 30 watts, maybe it's 22,"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,648880,650900,"maybe it's your laptop, you're pulling over 100"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,650900,653540,"from low battery, I dunno, it's just so entertaining."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,653540,656070,"Now the thing about this, every time I link it anywhere"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,656070,658470,"it sells out, so I'm tryin' to do my best"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,658470,660610,to keep an updated link in the description
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,660610,662250,for wherever I can find it in stock.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,662250,664600,I'll do that again with this video but no promises.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,664600,667540,"If you want this, you'll probably have to act pretty fast."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,667540,668373,Good luck.
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,668373,670589,"Okay, really truly last but not least, as a reward"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,670590,674000,"for making it this far into the video, giveaway time."
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,674000,675850,What better way to cap it off?
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,675850,679149,"So I'm teaming up with Aaron from ""Mr. Who's the Boss"""

-EZ_3Tq9a8c,695700,698710,"And by massive giveaway, I mean possibly"
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,698710,701120,the biggest tech giveaway of all time.
