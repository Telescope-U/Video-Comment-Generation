wLlL46pYcg4,640,2879,technology is progressing faster than
wLlL46pYcg4,2879,5440,ever with groundbreaking new ideas being
wLlL46pYcg4,5440,8400,explored every day from floating farms
wLlL46pYcg4,8400,11120,to edge computing here are the 15 most
wLlL46pYcg4,11120,14799,incredible emerging technologies
wLlL46pYcg4,14799,17520,number 15 spin launch
wLlL46pYcg4,17520,19119,there's been a lot of focus in recent
wLlL46pYcg4,19119,21199,years on private space companies and
wLlL46pYcg4,21199,23119,their quest to develop vehicles that can
wLlL46pYcg4,23119,25680,take paying customers into orbit but the
wLlL46pYcg4,25680,27439,reality is that especially with the
wLlL46pYcg4,27439,29359,pollution that traditional space flight
wLlL46pYcg4,29359,31599,creates these advances won't make a
wLlL46pYcg4,31599,33200,difference to people other than
wLlL46pYcg4,33200,35360,billionaires for quite some time
wLlL46pYcg4,35360,37200,there is however a lesser-known company
wLlL46pYcg4,37200,39280,that's making huge strides at making
wLlL46pYcg4,39280,41840,space technologies far cheaper greener
wLlL46pYcg4,41840,43760,and easier to access
wLlL46pYcg4,43760,45520,it's just that their focus is on
wLlL46pYcg4,45520,48320,satellites and not on human travel
wLlL46pYcg4,48320,50559,known as spin launch the concept is
wLlL46pYcg4,50559,52960,actually rather simple although it is of
wLlL46pYcg4,52960,54960,course extremely complicated to put into
wLlL46pYcg4,54960,56079,practice
wLlL46pYcg4,56079,58480,founded in 2014 and funded by large
wLlL46pYcg4,58480,61039,companies such as airbus and google they
wLlL46pYcg4,61039,63039,are building a kinetic energy launch
wLlL46pYcg4,63039,65840,system to insert satellites into orbit
wLlL46pYcg4,65840,68240,instead of relying on chemical rockets
wLlL46pYcg4,68240,70080,to do this they have designed a vacuum
wLlL46pYcg4,70080,72400,sealed centrifuge that will spin objects
wLlL46pYcg4,72400,74400,around before releasing them into space
wLlL46pYcg4,74400,77119,at speeds of up to 5000 miles per hour
wLlL46pYcg4,77119,79040,and once they reach a sub-orbital height
wLlL46pYcg4,79040,80880,a traditional rocket booster can take
wLlL46pYcg4,80880,82080,over
wLlL46pYcg4,82080,84159,this concept significantly reduces the
wLlL46pYcg4,84159,85840,amount of fuel that needs to be burned
wLlL46pYcg4,85840,87439,and to make it even better all of the
wLlL46pYcg4,87439,89360,energy used to power the centrifuge is
wLlL46pYcg4,89360,91680,derived from green sources such as solar
wLlL46pYcg4,91680,92720,and wind
wLlL46pYcg4,92720,94240,the company has even proved that most
wLlL46pYcg4,94240,95840,traditional satellite components are
wLlL46pYcg4,95840,98320,able to withstand the 10 000 g's that
wLlL46pYcg4,98320,100720,they'll be subjected to during a launch
wLlL46pYcg4,100720,102240,and even projects that it will cost less
wLlL46pYcg4,102240,104000,than half a million dollars to send one
wLlL46pYcg4,104000,106079,into space as opposed to the tens of
wLlL46pYcg4,106079,108000,millions it currently does
wLlL46pYcg4,108000,109840,with the test version already built and
wLlL46pYcg4,109840,111520,conducting launches they hope the
wLlL46pYcg4,111520,113280,full-size device will be ready within a
wLlL46pYcg4,113280,115520,few years this could permanently
wLlL46pYcg4,115520,117300,revolutionize satellite launches

wLlL46pYcg4,119119,122079,number 14 graphene
wLlL46pYcg4,122079,124240,industry is continually looking for new
wLlL46pYcg4,124240,126079,materials to offer stronger and more
wLlL46pYcg4,126079,128000,reliable performance but the next
wLlL46pYcg4,128000,129759,game-changing development is expected to
wLlL46pYcg4,129759,131360,be graphene
wLlL46pYcg4,131360,132959,it's a substance that's long been
wLlL46pYcg4,132959,134959,theorized to exist but has proven to be
wLlL46pYcg4,134959,136800,so complicated to manufacture that it's
wLlL46pYcg4,136800,139520,taken until now to become feasible as
wLlL46pYcg4,139520,141200,the name would suggest it is derived
wLlL46pYcg4,141200,142879,from graphite which is the material
wLlL46pYcg4,142879,144560,you'll be familiar with that's used in
wLlL46pYcg4,144560,147520,pencils made entirely from carbon atoms
wLlL46pYcg4,147520,149120,graphite is a three-dimensional
wLlL46pYcg4,149120,151040,structure but the exciting thing about
wLlL46pYcg4,151040,153280,graphene is that it's two-dimensional
wLlL46pYcg4,153280,154800,what this means is that the carbon is
wLlL46pYcg4,154800,156560,arranged perfectly in a hexagonal
wLlL46pYcg4,156560,159040,honeycomb formation that's only 0.3
wLlL46pYcg4,159040,161760,nanometers thick and there's just 0.1
wLlL46pYcg4,161760,164400,nanometers between each of the atoms
wLlL46pYcg4,164400,166400,in practice this new arrangement offers
wLlL46pYcg4,166400,168160,huge benefits that are only just
wLlL46pYcg4,168160,170480,starting to be fully understood graphene
wLlL46pYcg4,170480,172000,can conduct electricity far more
wLlL46pYcg4,172000,174160,efficiently than copper for example it's
wLlL46pYcg4,174160,176720,also 200 times stronger than steel but
wLlL46pYcg4,176720,179120,six times lighter it's almost completely
wLlL46pYcg4,179120,181280,transparent because it only absorbs two
wLlL46pYcg4,181280,183599,percent of light and it's impermeable to
wLlL46pYcg4,183599,186400,gases even the lightest ones and it can
wLlL46pYcg4,186400,188159,also have chemical components added to
wLlL46pYcg4,188159,190720,the surface to alter its properties
wLlL46pYcg4,190720,192640,researchers see graphene more as a
wLlL46pYcg4,192640,194640,platform that developers will be able to
wLlL46pYcg4,194640,196640,arrange in a way that plays to their
wLlL46pYcg4,196640,199040,needs it could for example revolutionize
wLlL46pYcg4,199040,200560,touch screen technologies be
wLlL46pYcg4,200560,202400,incorporated to make lighter composite
wLlL46pYcg4,202400,204480,materials and has a number of uses and
wLlL46pYcg4,204480,205920,electronics too
wLlL46pYcg4,205920,208239,the possibilities are truly endless and
wLlL46pYcg4,208239,210000,it's expected to be possible to produce
wLlL46pYcg4,210000,211680,it in commercial quantities within the
wLlL46pYcg4,211680,214319,next decade
wLlL46pYcg4,214319,217599,number 13 gps 3
wLlL46pYcg4,217599,220480,first beginning in 1973 and completed in
wLlL46pYcg4,220480,223760,1993 the american gps satellite network
wLlL46pYcg4,223760,226000,was the first global navigation system
wLlL46pYcg4,226000,228159,and revolutionize the way that everyone
wLlL46pYcg4,228159,230400,determines where they are on earth
wLlL46pYcg4,230400,232319,at first the benefits were envisaged for
wLlL46pYcg4,232319,234239,militaries but the technology has now
wLlL46pYcg4,234239,236480,had an impact on all of our lives from
wLlL46pYcg4,236480,238239,the way certain electronics works to
wLlL46pYcg4,238239,240000,satnav systems and location-based
wLlL46pYcg4,240000,242560,tracking the problem with gps though is
wLlL46pYcg4,242560,244720,that the original 24 satellites along
wLlL46pYcg4,244720,246560,with further ones that were subsequently
wLlL46pYcg4,246560,249120,added don't provide a perfect resolution
wLlL46pYcg4,249120,250720,and are only accurate to within a few
wLlL46pYcg4,250720,252799,feet they also don't provide full
wLlL46pYcg4,252799,254720,coverage around the world as anyone who
wLlL46pYcg4,254720,256320,has tried to use location tracking in
wLlL46pYcg4,256320,258079,mountainous areas or dense urban
wLlL46pYcg4,258079,260160,environments will know and the signals
wLlL46pYcg4,260160,262320,are actually relatively simple to block
wLlL46pYcg4,262320,264240,which is a constant threat for military
wLlL46pYcg4,264240,265120,use
wLlL46pYcg4,265120,266960,there is therefore huge demand for
wLlL46pYcg4,266960,269120,improving the system and the technology
wLlL46pYcg4,269120,271600,has already been developed to do this
wLlL46pYcg4,271600,274320,known as gps3 and built by lockheed
wLlL46pYcg4,274320,276400,martin the satellites are already being
wLlL46pYcg4,276400,278080,launched and are expected to have fully
wLlL46pYcg4,278080,280720,upgraded the network within a few years
wLlL46pYcg4,280720,282800,when the project is complete the signals
wLlL46pYcg4,282800,285040,will be far more precise than now and
wLlL46pYcg4,285040,286960,eight times stronger so they can't be
wLlL46pYcg4,286960,289040,blocked resulting in improved safety
wLlL46pYcg4,289040,291040,signal integrity and far greater
wLlL46pYcg4,291040,292200,accuracy
wLlL46pYcg4,292200,293759,[Music]
wLlL46pYcg4,293759,296800,number 12 floating farms
wLlL46pYcg4,296800,299040,as the world's population continues to
wLlL46pYcg4,299040,301440,grow one of the biggest problems we face
wLlL46pYcg4,301440,303199,right now is how to produce enough food
wLlL46pYcg4,303199,305600,to satisfy everyone's needs
wLlL46pYcg4,305600,307520,amazingly an estimated 30 percent of the
wLlL46pYcg4,307520,309600,global land surface is dedicated to
wLlL46pYcg4,309600,311759,agriculture and a third of that is used
wLlL46pYcg4,311759,313680,for crops and the remaining two-thirds
wLlL46pYcg4,313680,315759,is used for grazing livestock
wLlL46pYcg4,315759,317039,and this not only restricts the
wLlL46pYcg4,317039,319199,potential areas for inhabitation but
wLlL46pYcg4,319199,320720,also encourages large-scale
wLlL46pYcg4,320720,323039,deforestation and habitat change to
wLlL46pYcg4,323039,324960,create more farmland
wLlL46pYcg4,324960,326400,some companies are looking for
wLlL46pYcg4,326400,328400,alternatives to this and while you may
wLlL46pYcg4,328400,330160,have heard of vertical farms that look
wLlL46pYcg4,330160,332080,to improve the yield for the same size
wLlL46pYcg4,332080,334560,plot of land others are looking at far
wLlL46pYcg4,334560,336639,more radical solutions
wLlL46pYcg4,336639,338960,one is the idea of floating farms which
wLlL46pYcg4,338960,341039,can involve building huge complexes that
wLlL46pYcg4,341039,343039,sit on the surface of the ocean can be
wLlL46pYcg4,343039,344320,moved to where they're needed and
wLlL46pYcg4,344320,346400,crucially are temporary
wLlL46pYcg4,346400,348400,they make use of areas that wouldn't be
wLlL46pYcg4,348400,350479,used for anything else and turn it into
wLlL46pYcg4,350479,352560,a profitable commodity
wLlL46pYcg4,352560,354400,incredibly one of these has already been
wLlL46pYcg4,354400,356080,in operation for several years in the
wLlL46pYcg4,356080,357759,port of rotterdam in the netherlands
wLlL46pYcg4,357759,359280,where a company called belladon has
wLlL46pYcg4,359280,361199,built a floating platform designed to
wLlL46pYcg4,361199,363840,farm 40 muse rhine isle cows that are
wLlL46pYcg4,363840,366160,all milked by robots
wLlL46pYcg4,366160,368560,by producing the product as close to the
wLlL46pYcg4,368560,370560,end consumers as possible they're
wLlL46pYcg4,370560,372960,reducing transport costs too they also
wLlL46pYcg4,372960,374479,plan to be able to install floating
wLlL46pYcg4,374479,376479,farms in regions that have suffered from
wLlL46pYcg4,376479,378639,disasters to get food production up and
wLlL46pYcg4,378639,380560,running far quicker than would otherwise
wLlL46pYcg4,380560,383120,be possible
wLlL46pYcg4,383120,385919,number 11 edge computing
wLlL46pYcg4,385919,388240,the way we use computers has changed
wLlL46pYcg4,388240,390240,significantly in the past few decades
wLlL46pYcg4,390240,391919,and so has the way technology is
wLlL46pYcg4,391919,394319,designed to give us the best service at
wLlL46pYcg4,394319,396160,first everything was done on a singular
wLlL46pYcg4,396160,398400,device in our homes and now we mainly
wLlL46pYcg4,398400,400319,use cloud computing whereby most
wLlL46pYcg4,400319,402479,activities from our emails to documents
wLlL46pYcg4,402479,404160,and virtually everything else is held
wLlL46pYcg4,404160,406639,online and our devices are essentially
wLlL46pYcg4,406639,409440,windows that grant us access to this
wLlL46pYcg4,409440,411599,the problem with cloud computing however
wLlL46pYcg4,411599,413599,is that most companies rely on the
wLlL46pYcg4,413599,415520,infrastructure of just a few cloud
wLlL46pYcg4,415520,418319,providers amazon microsoft google and
wLlL46pYcg4,418319,421759,ibm with amazon alone accounting for 47
wLlL46pYcg4,421759,422960,of the market
wLlL46pYcg4,422960,424400,quite simply everything that can be
wLlL46pYcg4,424400,426240,moved onto the cloud has pretty much
wLlL46pYcg4,426240,428160,been done so already and there's very
wLlL46pYcg4,428160,430319,little room to grow in that space so
wLlL46pYcg4,430319,431360,others have been looking at the
wLlL46pYcg4,431360,433919,so-called edge of the cloud
wLlL46pYcg4,433919,435520,what this really means is that they're
wLlL46pYcg4,435520,437599,exploring ways to bring the processing
wLlL46pYcg4,437599,440160,and storage of the cloud geographically
wLlL46pYcg4,440160,442479,closer to where the user is in order to
wLlL46pYcg4,442479,444160,improve the experience
wLlL46pYcg4,444160,446000,rather than just relying on a few data
wLlL46pYcg4,446000,447919,centers it will see more work done
wLlL46pYcg4,447919,449840,locally and the idea is that this will
wLlL46pYcg4,449840,452080,significantly reduce latency will also
wLlL46pYcg4,452080,454160,improve privacy and security and will
wLlL46pYcg4,454160,455840,help reduce the bandwidth being used so
wLlL46pYcg4,455840,457680,the infrastructure doesn't buckle under
wLlL46pYcg4,457680,460160,the pressure of increased usage
wLlL46pYcg4,460160,462160,in many ways it may seem as if it's
wLlL46pYcg4,462160,464160,going back on the idea of cloud
wLlL46pYcg4,464160,466319,computing but it's really harnessing it
wLlL46pYcg4,466319,468720,to fuller effect if fingerprint or
wLlL46pYcg4,468720,470319,facial authorization is dealt with
wLlL46pYcg4,470319,472240,directly by your smartphone rather than
wLlL46pYcg4,472240,474400,waiting for a server to reply you'll be
wLlL46pYcg4,474400,476319,able to access your online content much
wLlL46pYcg4,476319,478879,easier similarly self-driving cars are
wLlL46pYcg4,478879,480479,currently the best example of edge
wLlL46pYcg4,480479,482240,computing rather than waiting for a
wLlL46pYcg4,482240,484000,server's response it can function
wLlL46pYcg4,484000,486319,independently but at the same time needs
wLlL46pYcg4,486319,488000,to be centrally controlled so it's
wLlL46pYcg4,488000,489680,automatically updated and so the
wLlL46pYcg4,489680,492960,algorithms can be improved
wLlL46pYcg4,492960,494160,number 10
wLlL46pYcg4,494160,496479,self-healing concrete
wLlL46pYcg4,496479,498400,concrete is one of the most important
wLlL46pYcg4,498400,499919,construction materials that's used
wLlL46pYcg4,499919,502319,around the world and is second to water
wLlL46pYcg4,502319,504960,in terms of the most consumed material
wLlL46pYcg4,504960,507199,amazingly twice as much concrete is used
wLlL46pYcg4,507199,509120,in construction than everything else
wLlL46pYcg4,509120,511199,combined this works out to be the
wLlL46pYcg4,511199,513200,equivalent of more than three tons per
wLlL46pYcg4,513200,515599,person in the world each year
wLlL46pYcg4,515599,517120,the problem is that even though it's a
wLlL46pYcg4,517120,519039,tough and durable material it's
wLlL46pYcg4,519039,520880,susceptible to wear and tear and can
wLlL46pYcg4,520880,522800,develop cracks and holes that affect its
wLlL46pYcg4,522800,525040,stability in the long term this means
wLlL46pYcg4,525040,526800,that it either needs to be maintained or
wLlL46pYcg4,526800,529279,replaced to avoid disaster which can be
wLlL46pYcg4,529279,531600,a costly endeavor but researchers have
wLlL46pYcg4,531600,533839,come up with a new solution self-healing
wLlL46pYcg4,533839,534959,concrete
wLlL46pYcg4,534959,537200,by adding bacterial spores to the
wLlL46pYcg4,537200,539279,concrete mix along with a food source
wLlL46pYcg4,539279,541600,like yeast extract an amazing thing
wLlL46pYcg4,541600,542560,happens
wLlL46pYcg4,542560,544800,when the concrete cracks the bacteria
wLlL46pYcg4,544800,546959,are exposed to oxygen and water and
wLlL46pYcg4,546959,549200,begin to consume the food and multiply
wLlL46pYcg4,549200,551279,and then produce calcium carbonate or
wLlL46pYcg4,551279,553680,limestone as a byproduct
wLlL46pYcg4,553680,556080,this in turn seals the crack again and
wLlL46pYcg4,556080,558080,if done right means that you won't even
wLlL46pYcg4,558080,559600,be able to see where the crack had
wLlL46pYcg4,559600,561279,formed in the first place
wLlL46pYcg4,561279,562959,for small openings the process can be
wLlL46pYcg4,562959,565360,completed with around 14 days and it'll
wLlL46pYcg4,565360,567279,prevent them from widening and becoming
wLlL46pYcg4,567279,568800,a greater problem
wLlL46pYcg4,568800,570720,soon it's expected that virtually all
wLlL46pYcg4,570720,572720,concrete will incorporate technology
wLlL46pYcg4,572720,574880,like this and the days of potentially
wLlL46pYcg4,574880,578480,dangerous faults will be over
wLlL46pYcg4,578480,581839,number nine hydrogen fuel cells
wLlL46pYcg4,581839,583680,the automotive industry is going through
wLlL46pYcg4,583680,585839,its biggest change in living memory with
wLlL46pYcg4,585839,587760,virtually every manufacturer trying to
wLlL46pYcg4,587760,589600,develop their own technologies to reduce
wLlL46pYcg4,589600,592160,the reliance on fossil fuels and while
wLlL46pYcg4,592160,594080,electric and battery concepts seem to be
wLlL46pYcg4,594080,596480,the way forwards they certainly aren't a
wLlL46pYcg4,596480,598000,magic bullet
wLlL46pYcg4,598000,599600,there's concerns surrounding the
wLlL46pYcg4,599600,601680,provision of green electricity to all
wLlL46pYcg4,601680,603279,that need it and the fact that our
wLlL46pYcg4,603279,605440,electrical grids simply aren't designed
wLlL46pYcg4,605440,607040,to handle the loads that will be
wLlL46pYcg4,607040,608240,required
wLlL46pYcg4,608240,610160,even if this was sorted there's also the
wLlL46pYcg4,610160,612079,fact that batteries are relatively very
wLlL46pYcg4,612079,613839,heavy for the amount of charge that they
wLlL46pYcg4,613839,616079,can hold and while they may be suitable
wLlL46pYcg4,616079,618160,for cars they're not yet at a place
wLlL46pYcg4,618160,620240,where they're viable for larger trucks
wLlL46pYcg4,620240,621920,ships or planes
wLlL46pYcg4,621920,624240,that's why another solution is needed
wLlL46pYcg4,624240,625839,and the most likely candidate is
wLlL46pYcg4,625839,627680,hydrogen fuel
wLlL46pYcg4,627680,629680,hydrogen itself can be produced by a
wLlL46pYcg4,629680,631920,range of methods such as natural gas
wLlL46pYcg4,631920,634240,nuclear power biomass and even other
wLlL46pYcg4,634240,636640,renewable energies and when it's used
wLlL46pYcg4,636640,639200,the only by-product is water
wLlL46pYcg4,639200,641519,in the uk a concept train has already
wLlL46pYcg4,641519,643519,been fitted with hydrogen cells and it's
wLlL46pYcg4,643519,645839,undergoing tests while aircraft
wLlL46pYcg4,645839,648160,manufacturers such as airbus see this as
wLlL46pYcg4,648160,650079,a far more viable target in the near
wLlL46pYcg4,650079,652640,future than full electrification and car
wLlL46pYcg4,652640,654320,companies too are looking at how it can
wLlL46pYcg4,654320,656720,be used the technology is approaching
wLlL46pYcg4,656720,658480,the stage where it's possible across a
wLlL46pYcg4,658480,660320,range of applications and it's only a
wLlL46pYcg4,660320,663839,matter of time until it's commonplace
wLlL46pYcg4,663839,667040,number eight satellite constellations
wLlL46pYcg4,667040,669040,as the cost of launching satellites into
wLlL46pYcg4,669040,671279,orbit reduces and with the improvement
wLlL46pYcg4,671279,673120,in component design and the potential
wLlL46pYcg4,673120,675600,uses of space technology a number of big
wLlL46pYcg4,675600,677360,tech companies are now exploring the
wLlL46pYcg4,677360,679360,feasibility of creating their own
wLlL46pYcg4,679360,681279,satellite constellations
wLlL46pYcg4,681279,683279,the idea of a network of satellites to
wLlL46pYcg4,683279,685680,perform a role isn't exactly new after
wLlL46pYcg4,685680,687120,all there are already six different
wLlL46pYcg4,687120,689040,navigational satellite constellations
wLlL46pYcg4,689040,691360,like gps and a number of one-way and
wLlL46pYcg4,691360,692800,two-way communication satellite
wLlL46pYcg4,692800,694560,constellations but these have
wLlL46pYcg4,694560,696480,traditionally only used a few dozen
wLlL46pYcg4,696480,698160,nodes to operate
wLlL46pYcg4,698160,700320,recently spacex has been creating a
wLlL46pYcg4,700320,703040,constellation of its own called starlink
wLlL46pYcg4,703040,705040,which will when it's completed provide
wLlL46pYcg4,705040,706800,internet access across most of the
wLlL46pYcg4,706800,708880,planet amazingly this involves
wLlL46pYcg4,708880,710959,positioning as many as twelve thousand
wLlL46pYcg4,710959,713680,in orbit to give optimal coverage and
wLlL46pYcg4,713680,715600,while the company may be paving the way
wLlL46pYcg4,715600,717440,it's not the only organization looking
wLlL46pYcg4,717440,718639,at doing this
wLlL46pYcg4,718639,720880,boeing oneweb and amazon are also
wLlL46pYcg4,720880,722079,looking to develop their own
wLlL46pYcg4,722079,724079,constellations to provide internet
wLlL46pYcg4,724079,726240,access and this is just scratching the
wLlL46pYcg4,726240,728639,surface of what they can be used for
wLlL46pYcg4,728639,730320,if you look up when it's dark you might
wLlL46pYcg4,730320,731600,just be able to see some of these
wLlL46pYcg4,731600,733440,satellites already and if progress
wLlL46pYcg4,733440,735279,continues at the current rate the night
wLlL46pYcg4,735279,738800,sky may soon be full of them
wLlL46pYcg4,738800,741839,number seven gpt-3
wLlL46pYcg4,741839,743440,tech companies around the world are in a
wLlL46pYcg4,743440,745040,race to develop the first full
wLlL46pYcg4,745040,747200,artificial intelligence but there are
wLlL46pYcg4,747200,749120,steps along the way that arguably are
wLlL46pYcg4,749120,751279,going to be far more impactful on the
wLlL46pYcg4,751279,753680,technology around us and how we live our
wLlL46pYcg4,753680,754720,lives
wLlL46pYcg4,754720,756720,one of these concepts is the idea of
wLlL46pYcg4,756720,758480,deep learning whereby computer
wLlL46pYcg4,758480,760880,algorithms can analyze past behavior and
wLlL46pYcg4,760880,763040,automatically find solutions to improve
wLlL46pYcg4,763040,764240,performance
wLlL46pYcg4,764240,765920,one of the most interesting forms of
wLlL46pYcg4,765920,768639,this is called gpt-3
wLlL46pYcg4,768639,771279,developed by openai it's the third
wLlL46pYcg4,771279,773200,generation of a language prediction
wLlL46pYcg4,773200,775360,model and the idea is that based on
wLlL46pYcg4,775360,777279,learning by itself it's able to write
wLlL46pYcg4,777279,780160,text in the same way as a human does
wLlL46pYcg4,780160,781839,it's one of the most difficult types of
wLlL46pYcg4,781839,784399,human imitation and this latest attempt
wLlL46pYcg4,784399,786399,is almost unbelievable
wLlL46pYcg4,786399,788399,based on initial studies it's virtually
wLlL46pYcg4,788399,790320,impossible to differentiate between
wLlL46pYcg4,790320,792959,something written by gpt3 or by an
wLlL46pYcg4,792959,795040,actual person and companies like
wLlL46pYcg4,795040,796560,microsoft have already begun to
wLlL46pYcg4,796560,798720,incorporate it into their products
wLlL46pYcg4,798720,800240,described recently as being one of the
wLlL46pYcg4,800240,802079,most interesting and important ai
wLlL46pYcg4,802079,804880,systems ever produced gpt-3 will further
wLlL46pYcg4,804880,807040,blur the lines of reality and you may
wLlL46pYcg4,807040,808959,well find yourself reading news articles
wLlL46pYcg4,808959,810880,or even novels that haven't had any
wLlL46pYcg4,810880,814320,human involvement whatsoever
wLlL46pYcg4,814320,817360,number six connected homes
wLlL46pYcg4,817360,819120,throughout history inventions have
wLlL46pYcg4,819120,821760,helped us save time on basic tasks so we
wLlL46pYcg4,821760,823360,can dedicate ourselves to more
wLlL46pYcg4,823360,826079,complicated ones and this progression is
wLlL46pYcg4,826079,828560,continuing into the 21st century
wLlL46pYcg4,828560,830720,while the concept of connected homes
wLlL46pYcg4,830720,833360,isn't in itself a new one the increasing
wLlL46pYcg4,833360,835199,presence of the internet of things and
wLlL46pYcg4,835199,837199,technological advancements means that
wLlL46pYcg4,837199,838399,it's going to become far more
wLlL46pYcg4,838399,840639,commonplace reliable and functional in
wLlL46pYcg4,840639,843839,the coming years in 2013 the market in
wLlL46pYcg4,843839,846079,the u.s alone was worth almost 6 billion
wLlL46pYcg4,846079,847839,dollars and right now it's estimated
wLlL46pYcg4,847839,850079,that 37 percent of households in the u.s
wLlL46pYcg4,850079,852079,have a smart device in their home
wLlL46pYcg4,852079,853839,right now these are usually in the form
wLlL46pYcg4,853839,856079,of doorbells heating light bulbs
wLlL46pYcg4,856079,858480,speakers and voice activated assistance
wLlL46pYcg4,858480,859920,but there are so many different ways
wLlL46pYcg4,859920,861839,technology can be incorporated that
wLlL46pYcg4,861839,863600,things will look very different in a few
wLlL46pYcg4,863600,864560,years
wLlL46pYcg4,864560,866959,from connected fridges to power sockets
wLlL46pYcg4,866959,869360,bathroom appliances and even furniture
wLlL46pYcg4,869360,871040,virtually everything that's electrically
wLlL46pYcg4,871040,872959,operated could potentially have a chip
wLlL46pYcg4,872959,874959,installed that'll make it operate from a
wLlL46pYcg4,874959,877839,smart device or simply by your voice
wLlL46pYcg4,877839,879360,furthermore with so much of it being
wLlL46pYcg4,879360,881680,automated our homes will take care of
wLlL46pYcg4,881680,883920,themselves and allow us to focus more on

wLlL46pYcg4,887839,890959,number five lithium metal battery
wLlL46pYcg4,890959,892880,there's a focus right now on moving away
wLlL46pYcg4,892880,895360,from energy that produces emissions and
wLlL46pYcg4,895360,896800,one of the best ways to do this is
wLlL46pYcg4,896800,899040,converting everything we use to run on
wLlL46pYcg4,899040,901519,electricity as long as the electricity
wLlL46pYcg4,901519,904079,comes from green sources major strides
wLlL46pYcg4,904079,905199,have been made in the past couple
wLlL46pYcg4,905199,907279,decades but one of the biggest limiting
wLlL46pYcg4,907279,910480,factors is the capability of batteries
wLlL46pYcg4,910480,912240,currently the most reliable and
wLlL46pYcg4,912240,914320,cost-effective design that's used is a
wLlL46pYcg4,914320,916480,lithium-ion battery but these have
wLlL46pYcg4,916480,918240,limits with how much they can charge and
wLlL46pYcg4,918240,920240,how quickly this can be done as well as
wLlL46pYcg4,920240,922160,some concerns about their safety if
wLlL46pYcg4,922160,923600,they're damaged
wLlL46pYcg4,923600,925760,a company called quantum scape is
wLlL46pYcg4,925760,927920,however developing an alternative which
wLlL46pYcg4,927920,929839,instead of having liquid parts like a
wLlL46pYcg4,929839,932800,lithium-ion battery is solid
wLlL46pYcg4,932800,934959,known as a lithium-metal battery the
wLlL46pYcg4,934959,936800,results from the company's early tests
wLlL46pYcg4,936800,938560,have suggested these could eventually
wLlL46pYcg4,938560,939920,increase the range of an electric
wLlL46pYcg4,939920,942480,vehicle by as much as 80 percent and can
wLlL46pYcg4,942480,944320,be recharged in just a fraction of the
wLlL46pYcg4,944320,945440,time too
wLlL46pYcg4,945440,947199,right now the prototypes are too large
wLlL46pYcg4,947199,948639,to be fitted to cars but they're
wLlL46pYcg4,948639,950160,expected to become much smaller in the
wLlL46pYcg4,950160,951759,coming years so much so that
wLlL46pYcg4,951759,953440,quantumscape has already signed an
wLlL46pYcg4,953440,955600,agreement with vw to start selling
wLlL46pYcg4,955600,957519,electric vehicles with the new batteries

wLlL46pYcg4,960560,963040,number four 3d printing
wLlL46pYcg4,963040,965360,3d printing has had a varied history
wLlL46pYcg4,965360,967120,since it first started being used in the
wLlL46pYcg4,967120,969759,1980s and even until recently it's only
wLlL46pYcg4,969759,972240,been useful for very specific tasks
wLlL46pYcg4,972240,974160,essentially feeding liquefied material

wLlL46pYcg4,978240,980240,object it's a technique that's mostly
wLlL46pYcg4,980240,982000,been known for creating small plastic
wLlL46pYcg4,982000,983920,objects or replacement components for
wLlL46pYcg4,983920,986480,certain devices as our understanding of
wLlL46pYcg4,986480,988800,materials has improved though 3d
wLlL46pYcg4,988800,990480,printers are increasingly being able to
wLlL46pYcg4,990480,992800,make objects out of different substances
wLlL46pYcg4,992800,994800,and are becoming seen as potentially the
wLlL46pYcg4,994800,996639,future of manufacturing
wLlL46pYcg4,996639,998639,from clothing and food to medical
wLlL46pYcg4,998639,1000560,devices and the ability to rapidly
wLlL46pYcg4,1000560,1003120,prototype new designs the possibilities
wLlL46pYcg4,1003120,1004800,are endless but perhaps the most
wLlL46pYcg4,1004800,1007040,exciting area is how it'll change large
wLlL46pYcg4,1007040,1008240,projects
wLlL46pYcg4,1008240,1009839,there's already a number of buildings
wLlL46pYcg4,1009839,1011199,around the world that have been built
wLlL46pYcg4,1011199,1013600,from 3d printed parts and this is going
wLlL46pYcg4,1013600,1015519,to become even more common instead of
wLlL46pYcg4,1015519,1016880,needing to ship all of the different
wLlL46pYcg4,1016880,1018880,types of bricks and other parts needed
wLlL46pYcg4,1018880,1021120,to build a house all that's needed is a
wLlL46pYcg4,1021120,1023680,supply of the basic material and a
wLlL46pYcg4,1023680,1024880,printer and everything can be
wLlL46pYcg4,1024880,1027038,manufactured on site it'll reduce
wLlL46pYcg4,1027038,1029120,transport needs wastage and increase
wLlL46pYcg4,1029120,1031120,efficiency and could mean new homes can
wLlL46pYcg4,1031120,1032880,be built at a fraction of the time they
wLlL46pYcg4,1032880,1035438,currently take
wLlL46pYcg4,1035438,1036839,number three
wLlL46pYcg4,1036839,1039918,blockchain there are two main reactions
wLlL46pYcg4,1039918,1042240,when people hear of blockchain either
wLlL46pYcg4,1042240,1043600,they start telling you about the best
wLlL46pYcg4,1043600,1045918,new cryptocurrencies to invest in or
wLlL46pYcg4,1045918,1048400,they switch off from boredom the fact is
wLlL46pYcg4,1048400,1050320,though that while blockchain technology
wLlL46pYcg4,1050320,1052559,does underpin the operation of these new
wLlL46pYcg4,1052559,1055120,decentralized currencies this is just
wLlL46pYcg4,1055120,1056880,the beginning of how useful and
wLlL46pYcg4,1056880,1058799,integrated to our lives that it will
wLlL46pYcg4,1058799,1059919,become
wLlL46pYcg4,1059919,1062240,put simply a blockchain is a list of
wLlL46pYcg4,1062240,1064080,information that's linked together by a
wLlL46pYcg4,1064080,1066640,cryptographic technique and once a block
wLlL46pYcg4,1066640,1069280,has been added it can't be changed and
wLlL46pYcg4,1069280,1071360,acts as a permanent record
wLlL46pYcg4,1071360,1073679,to begin with this was used to prove who
wLlL46pYcg4,1073679,1076000,owns a particular coin of currency or
wLlL46pYcg4,1076000,1078799,more recently pieces of digital art but
wLlL46pYcg4,1078799,1080160,there are a number of companies
wLlL46pYcg4,1080160,1083120,exploring how much wider the uses are
wLlL46pYcg4,1083120,1084880,there are already examples of how
wLlL46pYcg4,1084880,1086720,blockchain is being used to enable
wLlL46pYcg4,1086720,1088480,energy trading and various other
wLlL46pYcg4,1088480,1090400,transactions but perhaps the most
wLlL46pYcg4,1090400,1092080,important use is that it can track the
wLlL46pYcg4,1092080,1094400,history of individual products
wLlL46pYcg4,1094400,1096640,the food industry can benefit hugely
wLlL46pYcg4,1096640,1098799,from this by being able to prove exactly
wLlL46pYcg4,1098799,1100400,where and when ingredients were
wLlL46pYcg4,1100400,1103039,harvested or cooked and brands will also
wLlL46pYcg4,1103039,1104960,be able to use blockchain to prove
wLlL46pYcg4,1104960,1106880,whether an item is an original or a
wLlL46pYcg4,1106880,1109280,forgery
wLlL46pYcg4,1109280,1112960,number two fighting fire with sound
wLlL46pYcg4,1112960,1115520,with our changing climate wildfires are
wLlL46pYcg4,1115520,1117840,becoming more common across the planet
wLlL46pYcg4,1117840,1119520,and they're becoming even more difficult
wLlL46pYcg4,1119520,1120720,to control
wLlL46pYcg4,1120720,1123520,as an example in california alone five
wLlL46pYcg4,1123520,1125919,times the area is burning each year now
wLlL46pYcg4,1125919,1128559,compared to what happened in the 1970s
wLlL46pYcg4,1128559,1130880,this is only expected to increase
wLlL46pYcg4,1130880,1132799,traditionally the way to extinguish or
wLlL46pYcg4,1132799,1134720,at least limit the spread of fire would
wLlL46pYcg4,1134720,1136880,be to use huge quantities of water or
wLlL46pYcg4,1136880,1139200,foam but with water shortages happening
wLlL46pYcg4,1139200,1141200,too and the reluctance to drop chemicals
wLlL46pYcg4,1141200,1143679,onto the land an alternative can't come
wLlL46pYcg4,1143679,1144960,soon enough
wLlL46pYcg4,1144960,1147360,luckily a solution was first revealed in
wLlL46pYcg4,1147360,1149919,2015 and has continued in development to
wLlL46pYcg4,1149919,1151760,the point where it'll soon be deployed
wLlL46pYcg4,1151760,1153440,on a large scale
wLlL46pYcg4,1153440,1155440,first designed to put out small fires in
wLlL46pYcg4,1155440,1158000,kitchens the acoustic extinguisher uses
wLlL46pYcg4,1158000,1160320,sound waves to push oxygen away from the
wLlL46pYcg4,1160320,1162240,source of a fire and spread it over a
wLlL46pYcg4,1162240,1164799,wider area this cuts off the fuel of the
wLlL46pYcg4,1164799,1166720,fire and if maintained for long enough
wLlL46pYcg4,1166720,1169200,will simply cause it to fizzle out
wLlL46pYcg4,1169200,1170640,there have been attempts to do this
wLlL46pYcg4,1170640,1172240,before but now that the optimal
wLlL46pYcg4,1172240,1173760,frequencies and techniques have been
wLlL46pYcg4,1173760,1175760,figured out it's very likely that this
wLlL46pYcg4,1175760,1177360,will become one of the main methods of
wLlL46pYcg4,1177360,1181120,fire control in the coming decades
wLlL46pYcg4,1181120,1184320,number one quantum computing
wLlL46pYcg4,1184320,1186880,we all rely on classical computers for
wLlL46pYcg4,1186880,1189120,everyday tasks but there's a point at
wLlL46pYcg4,1189120,1191039,which no matter how many powerful chips
wLlL46pYcg4,1191039,1192720,you connect together they become
wLlL46pYcg4,1192720,1194480,impractical to perform highly
wLlL46pYcg4,1194480,1197200,complicated roles computer scientists
wLlL46pYcg4,1197200,1198880,from around the world have since the
wLlL46pYcg4,1198880,1201200,1980s been pursuing the next big
wLlL46pYcg4,1201200,1203600,development the creation of a quantum
wLlL46pYcg4,1203600,1205840,computer and they're now closer than
wLlL46pYcg4,1205840,1208480,ever essentially a quantum computer is
wLlL46pYcg4,1208480,1210400,different to a classical one in the way
wLlL46pYcg4,1210400,1213280,that it stores and handles information
wLlL46pYcg4,1213280,1214799,in a classical computer you'll be
wLlL46pYcg4,1214799,1216720,familiar with bits that can either be a
wLlL46pYcg4,1216720,1219520,one or a zero but in a quantum computer
wLlL46pYcg4,1219520,1222159,they use qubits which can be in a one or
wLlL46pYcg4,1222159,1224880,a zero quantum state or a superposition
wLlL46pYcg4,1224880,1226720,of both what this means is that a
wLlL46pYcg4,1226720,1229039,quantum computer is able to solve any
wLlL46pYcg4,1229039,1231360,problem a classical one can and vice
wLlL46pYcg4,1231360,1233760,versa and in some situations we'll be
wLlL46pYcg4,1233760,1236080,far more efficient in doing so
wLlL46pYcg4,1236080,1237679,one of the more interesting things about
wLlL46pYcg4,1237679,1239440,quantum computers is that they won't
wLlL46pYcg4,1239440,1241919,actually always be the better choice and
wLlL46pYcg4,1241919,1243520,researchers are still exploring the
wLlL46pYcg4,1243520,1245280,situations when they will offer an
wLlL46pYcg4,1245280,1247280,advantage but the biggest hurdle right
wLlL46pYcg4,1247280,1249039,now is building one that's large and
wLlL46pYcg4,1249039,1250880,stable enough to see how well it can
wLlL46pYcg4,1250880,1253360,perform
