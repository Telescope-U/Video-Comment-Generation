EK0uD4bDWTw,560,2399,remember 15 years ago when everyone and
EK0uD4bDWTw,2399,3840,their grandma was caught up in the wii
EK0uD4bDWTw,3840,5680,sports craze nintendo switch sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,5680,7200,tries to recapture that lightning in a
EK0uD4bDWTw,7200,8800,bottle moment with a tighter but all too
EK0uD4bDWTw,8800,10639,familiar experience
EK0uD4bDWTw,10639,12559,it refines the same concept of simple
EK0uD4bDWTw,12559,14240,family-friendly motion controlled games
EK0uD4bDWTw,14240,15759,and applies it to a limited selection of
EK0uD4bDWTw,15759,17760,new and old sports just like wii sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,17760,19840,before it nintendo switch sports is best
EK0uD4bDWTw,19840,21760,played as a fun but shallow party game
EK0uD4bDWTw,21760,23119,you can break out for friends and family
EK0uD4bDWTw,23119,24720,in a pinch though this time it's not
EK0uD4bDWTw,24720,27390,quite the novelty it was back in 2006.
EK0uD4bDWTw,27390,35840,[Music]
EK0uD4bDWTw,35840,37120,there aren't as many games in switch
EK0uD4bDWTw,37120,38399,sports as there were in wii sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,38399,40559,resort which had 12 but the six that are
EK0uD4bDWTw,40559,42399,here are higher quality on average
EK0uD4bDWTw,42399,43920,there's fun to be had in playing a quick
EK0uD4bDWTw,43920,45680,tennis match against some npcs or
EK0uD4bDWTw,45680,47200,bowling a few frames alone but that's
EK0uD4bDWTw,47200,48800,not the point switch sports is
EK0uD4bDWTw,48800,50239,undeniably at its best when you're
EK0uD4bDWTw,50239,51440,playing in the same room with other
EK0uD4bDWTw,51440,53039,people waving your arms and legs around
EK0uD4bDWTw,53039,54879,like maniacs once i played a few rounds
EK0uD4bDWTw,54879,56320,with my parents and then a group of
EK0uD4bDWTw,56320,57840,friends the magic of wii sports came
EK0uD4bDWTw,57840,60480,back in force
EK0uD4bDWTw,62360,64680,[Music]
EK0uD4bDWTw,64680,66000,[Applause]
EK0uD4bDWTw,66000,67439,it's fun to watch the difference between
EK0uD4bDWTw,67439,69520,how gamers and non-gamers play i stood
EK0uD4bDWTw,69520,71360,relatively still while playing a match
EK0uD4bDWTw,71360,73200,at badminton making the bare minimum
EK0uD4bDWTw,73200,74880,motions with the joy-con necessary to
EK0uD4bDWTw,74880,76960,trigger on-screen movements my mom
EK0uD4bDWTw,76960,77840,though
EK0uD4bDWTw,77840,79439,she lunged across the room to return a
EK0uD4bDWTw,79439,81520,shot threw her shoulder into each smash
EK0uD4bDWTw,81520,82960,and ultimately ended up winded because
EK0uD4bDWTw,82960,84320,she wasn't playing switch sports like a
EK0uD4bDWTw,84320,85840,video game she was playing it like the
EK0uD4bDWTw,85840,88320,real thing similarly when bowling both
EK0uD4bDWTw,88320,89759,my parents tended to walk up to the
EK0uD4bDWTw,89759,91360,screen every time they threw the ball
EK0uD4bDWTw,91360,93119,because the simplicity of it made those
EK0uD4bDWTw,93119,94640,movements feel all the more natural to
EK0uD4bDWTw,94640,96159,them like they were bowling around in
EK0uD4bDWTw,96159,97200,real life
EK0uD4bDWTw,97200,98880,but to really test out switch sports in
EK0uD4bDWTw,98880,100799,its natural environment you need a party
EK0uD4bDWTw,100799,102320,so i got together with a group of 12
EK0uD4bDWTw,102320,103920,friends and let them all have at it
EK0uD4bDWTw,103920,105520,beyond some of the routine headaches
EK0uD4bDWTw,105520,106720,with connecting all the joy con
EK0uD4bDWTw,106720,108479,correctly getting my friends up and at
EK0uD4bDWTw,108479,110479,it was a breeze
EK0uD4bDWTw,110479,112000,every single game in the collection is
EK0uD4bDWTw,112000,113920,immediately more fun in this setting
EK0uD4bDWTw,113920,115920,chombra becomes a series of wild flails
EK0uD4bDWTw,115920,117840,while onlookers cheer on badminton
EK0uD4bDWTw,117840,119680,emerges as an intense back and forth
EK0uD4bDWTw,119680,120880,where neither player is willing to
EK0uD4bDWTw,120880,122719,accept defeat and soccer turns into a
EK0uD4bDWTw,122719,124240,mad sprint to the ball to try and get
EK0uD4bDWTw,124240,125920,some last second diving headers in
EK0uD4bDWTw,125920,127520,before the clock hits zero and even
EK0uD4bDWTw,127520,129280,though it's limited to just a few tracks
EK0uD4bDWTw,129280,131039,switch sports has some bops for menu
EK0uD4bDWTw,131039,132720,music that gave this fan of the original
EK0uD4bDWTw,132720,134640,a solid rush of nostalgia on more than
EK0uD4bDWTw,134640,136239,one occasion i simply let the tracks
EK0uD4bDWTw,136239,137680,play out before moving on to another
EK0uD4bDWTw,137680,139240,sport
EK0uD4bDWTw,139240,139760,[Applause]
EK0uD4bDWTw,139760,145200,[Music]
EK0uD4bDWTw,145200,146640,some of switch sports's games fare
EK0uD4bDWTw,146640,148160,better than others when it comes to the
EK0uD4bDWTw,148160,150000,intuitiveness of the controls
EK0uD4bDWTw,150000,151599,specifically volleyball is the most
EK0uD4bDWTw,151599,153200,difficult to simply pick up and play
EK0uD4bDWTw,153200,154640,during any given match you'll be
EK0uD4bDWTw,154640,155920,automatically shuffled through all the
EK0uD4bDWTw,155920,157519,different positions from server to
EK0uD4bDWTw,157519,159519,setter to blocker your success is almost
EK0uD4bDWTw,159519,161200,entirely based on cooperation with your
EK0uD4bDWTw,161200,163440,teammate because well-timed sets jumps
EK0uD4bDWTw,163440,165440,and spikes compound into stronger harder
EK0uD4bDWTw,165440,167680,to return shots
EK0uD4bDWTw,167680,169120,compare that to badminton which is
EK0uD4bDWTw,169120,170959,easily my favorite sport of the bunch it
EK0uD4bDWTw,170959,172800,offers the most control rewarding
EK0uD4bDWTw,172800,174959,underhand returns smashes birdie
EK0uD4bDWTw,174959,177519,placement and more fine-tuned executions
EK0uD4bDWTw,177519,178640,you can even hold the trigger to
EK0uD4bDWTw,178640,180319,initiate a drop shot forcing your
EK0uD4bDWTw,180319,182000,opponent to rush the net so you can then
EK0uD4bDWTw,182000,183680,satisfyingly smash the birdie to the
EK0uD4bDWTw,183680,185120,opposite corner of the court it's
EK0uD4bDWTw,185120,186959,limited to two players at a time which
EK0uD4bDWTw,186959,188959,feels like a big missed opportunity but
EK0uD4bDWTw,188959,190640,the often heated returns feel much more
EK0uD4bDWTw,190640,192720,intense for it bowling also gives you a
EK0uD4bDWTw,192720,194400,high degree of control over the ball to
EK0uD4bDWTw,194400,195599,the point where i was quickly bullying
EK0uD4bDWTw,195599,197519,150 point games without breaking the
EK0uD4bDWTw,197519,199840,sweat
EK0uD4bDWTw,200000,201680,but the real challenge is in the special
EK0uD4bDWTw,201680,203440,mode which throws increasingly difficult
EK0uD4bDWTw,203440,205120,obstacles in the path of your strike and
EK0uD4bDWTw,205120,207040,will give even the best we bowlers a run
EK0uD4bDWTw,207040,208720,for their money
EK0uD4bDWTw,208720,210239,it also gives you and up to three
EK0uD4bDWTw,210239,211200,friends the option to play
EK0uD4bDWTw,211200,213360,simultaneously that's great because
EK0uD4bDWTw,213360,214879,everyone doesn't have to sit around and
EK0uD4bDWTw,214879,216319,wait for everybody else to finish the
EK0uD4bDWTw,216319,218480,frame the result is yeah a little
EK0uD4bDWTw,218480,222000,chaotic but fittingly fun
EK0uD4bDWTw,223360,225440,soccer is the most disappointing it
EK0uD4bDWTw,225440,227440,plays like a slower less flashy version
EK0uD4bDWTw,227440,229599,of rocket league the problem though is
EK0uD4bDWTw,229599,230879,that you spend most of the time in a
EK0uD4bDWTw,230879,232799,match slowly running across the field
EK0uD4bDWTw,232799,234799,one on one is generally more enjoyable
EK0uD4bDWTw,234799,236239,simply by virtue of the field being
EK0uD4bDWTw,236239,238080,smaller but four on four is a drag
EK0uD4bDWTw,238080,239599,because it takes forever thanks to the
EK0uD4bDWTw,239599,241439,ball constantly trading possession
EK0uD4bDWTw,241439,243200,soccer also only allows for up to two
EK0uD4bDWTw,243200,244879,human players at a time preventing it
EK0uD4bDWTw,244879,246640,from being redeemed is a fun party game
EK0uD4bDWTw,246640,248239,the simple soccer shootout mini-game
EK0uD4bDWTw,248239,250080,that requires a physical leg strap just
EK0uD4bDWTw,250080,252400,boils down to a basic timing exercise if
EK0uD4bDWTw,252400,254080,you're worried about losing out on value
EK0uD4bDWTw,254080,255680,because you decided to download switch
EK0uD4bDWTw,255680,256799,sports instead of picking it up
EK0uD4bDWTw,256799,258959,physically and paying an extra 10
EK0uD4bDWTw,258959,260310,don't
EK0uD4bDWTw,260310,263459,[Music]
EK0uD4bDWTw,264400,266160,for intensity nothing in this lineup
EK0uD4bDWTw,266160,268639,matches chombra's sword fighting battles
EK0uD4bDWTw,268639,270320,both fighters enter a sort of stilted
EK0uD4bDWTw,270320,271919,dance where one blocks while the other
EK0uD4bDWTw,271919,273759,attempts to pull off parallel slashes to
EK0uD4bDWTw,273759,275360,cut through their defenses if you've
EK0uD4bDWTw,275360,277120,chosen to use the charge sword more
EK0uD4bDWTw,277120,278880,successful blocks result in a powerful
EK0uD4bDWTw,278880,280960,and satisfying return strike while twin
EK0uD4bDWTw,280960,282560,sword wielders can swing their weapons
EK0uD4bDWTw,282560,284400,in unison to execute a zelda-like spin
EK0uD4bDWTw,284400,286080,attack that makes their generally more
EK0uD4bDWTw,286080,287680,awkward handling worth it though the
EK0uD4bDWTw,287680,289360,motion controls don't always feel
EK0uD4bDWTw,289360,290960,perfectly accurate the matches can
EK0uD4bDWTw,290960,292639,result in memorable come-from-behind
EK0uD4bDWTw,292639,293919,moments where you go from being on the
EK0uD4bDWTw,293919,296000,defensive to moving in for the kill so
EK0uD4bDWTw,296000,297840,to speak
EK0uD4bDWTw,297840,299919,yeah the loser just comically falls into
EK0uD4bDWTw,299919,302639,a pool of water this is nintendo after
EK0uD4bDWTw,302639,304479,all
EK0uD4bDWTw,304479,306080,finally switch sports's version of
EK0uD4bDWTw,306080,307840,tennis is almost exactly like it was in
EK0uD4bDWTw,307840,310000,wii sports and you can only play doubles
EK0uD4bDWTw,310000,312320,with other players or against npcs which
EK0uD4bDWTw,312320,314240,differentiates it from the 1v1 match as
EK0uD4bDWTw,314240,316160,a badminton it feels far more timing
EK0uD4bDWTw,316160,318080,oriented than badminton but it does give
EK0uD4bDWTw,318080,319759,you the ability to slice and law based
EK0uD4bDWTw,319759,321039,on how you hit the ball those
EK0uD4bDWTw,321039,322479,differences make it better for bigger
EK0uD4bDWTw,322479,323840,parties but it feels shallow by
EK0uD4bDWTw,323840,325250,comparison
EK0uD4bDWTw,325250,327759,[Applause]
EK0uD4bDWTw,327759,329520,so that all sounds like a lot of fun but
EK0uD4bDWTw,329520,331360,here's the thing it's unlikely to take
EK0uD4bDWTw,331360,332800,you and your friends more than an hour
EK0uD4bDWTw,332800,334400,or two to play through everything switch
EK0uD4bDWTw,334400,336320,sports has to offer but that simplicity
EK0uD4bDWTw,336320,337759,is what makes it work so well as a party
EK0uD4bDWTw,337759,339600,starter its selection of six sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,339600,341280,doesn't have a lot of staying power and
EK0uD4bDWTw,341280,343039,the lack of golf at launch is sorely
EK0uD4bDWTw,343039,344639,missed the light at the end of the
EK0uD4bDWTw,344639,345840,tunnel is that we'll get to hit the
EK0uD4bDWTw,345840,347520,links again when it's released as dlc
EK0uD4bDWTw,347520,350680,this fall
EK0uD4bDWTw,352479,354400,nintendo switch sports like wii sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,354400,356400,and wii sports resort before it is best
EK0uD4bDWTw,356400,358240,played as a party game you want to
EK0uD4bDWTw,358240,359919,experience its six motion controlled
EK0uD4bDWTw,359919,361280,games when you need to break them out
EK0uD4bDWTw,361280,362400,for a gathering that needs a quick
EK0uD4bDWTw,362400,364960,injection of goofy active fun but it's
EK0uD4bDWTw,364960,366880,not going to go far beyond that it's
EK0uD4bDWTw,366880,369039,sparse mixture of old and new sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,369039,371039,varies in quality but switch sports
EK0uD4bDWTw,371039,372639,largely sticks the landing on what made
EK0uD4bDWTw,372639,374560,its predecessors memorable intuitive
EK0uD4bDWTw,374560,376160,motion controls the ability to
EK0uD4bDWTw,376160,377840,effortlessly get a group of people up
EK0uD4bDWTw,377840,379840,and moving and some killer menu music
EK0uD4bDWTw,379840,381199,that's liable to get stuck in your head
EK0uD4bDWTw,381199,382960,all day just don't expect to spend a
EK0uD4bDWTw,382960,384160,whole lot of time with it before the
EK0uD4bDWTw,384160,386240,novelty wears off if you're looking for
