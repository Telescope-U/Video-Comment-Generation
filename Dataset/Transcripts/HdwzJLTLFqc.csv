HdwzJLTLFqc,20890,23500,Let me answer that question with another question.
HdwzJLTLFqc,23500,25300,What does it mean to be alive?
HdwzJLTLFqc,25300,30300,Most biologists define life as an organism with cells
HdwzJLTLFqc,30430,33560,that respond to their environment and an organism
HdwzJLTLFqc,33560,35610,that can reproduce itself.
HdwzJLTLFqc,35610,38250,Viruses don't meet that definition
HdwzJLTLFqc,38250,40700,because they do not have cells.
HdwzJLTLFqc,40700,43550,They reproduce only by co-opting
HdwzJLTLFqc,43550,47040,the reproductive capabilities of a living cell.
HdwzJLTLFqc,47040,50410,"Yet, we see viruses having a very direct impact"
HdwzJLTLFqc,50410,53860,on our lives and the lives of other creatures in this world.
HdwzJLTLFqc,53860,57896,So it just goes to show us that the very definition of life

HdwzJLTLFqc,747672,748570,"- Oh, as [beep]. Can I say that?"
HdwzJLTLFqc,748570,749737,Or what do I say?
HdwzJLTLFqc,749737,753299,"@NekoMiller asks, ""Blue eyes are weird AF."
HdwzJLTLFqc,753299,757260,"Like honestly, how does a mutation like that even happen?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,757260,761450,Mutations in biology occur in the DNA
HdwzJLTLFqc,761450,762980,when it's being copied.
HdwzJLTLFqc,762980,764313,It's not a perfect process.
HdwzJLTLFqc,764314,766110,Mistakes are made.
HdwzJLTLFqc,766110,769349,"Oftentimes, those mistakes lead to new features"
HdwzJLTLFqc,769349,771020,in the organism.
HdwzJLTLFqc,771020,773080,"Usually, they're not very useful"
HdwzJLTLFqc,773080,774800,"and they disappear over time,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,774800,778211,but sometimes they can impart a benefit and they persist.
HdwzJLTLFqc,778211,782840,This is one of the fundamental ways that new traits
HdwzJLTLFqc,782840,785690,are introduced into the evolutionary process.
HdwzJLTLFqc,785690,789765,Blue eyes were introduced in that way fairly recently
HdwzJLTLFqc,789765,791830,in human evolution.
HdwzJLTLFqc,791830,794197,"They have persisted, but no one's quite sure yet"
HdwzJLTLFqc,794197,797797,what the advantage of blue eyes may be.
HdwzJLTLFqc,797797,801550,"@TarrahLuzuriaga asks, ""How do extinct species"
HdwzJLTLFqc,801550,802880,"come back to the world?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,802880,804205,"Short answer, they don't."
HdwzJLTLFqc,804205,808110,"They're extinct, but there are efforts underway now"
HdwzJLTLFqc,808110,812680,to try to recreate or bring back some extinct species
HdwzJLTLFqc,812680,815649,like the wooly mammoth from ancient DNA.
HdwzJLTLFqc,815650,818487,"It's still a work in progress, a long way off,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,818487,823257,but some experts are working on that very question.
HdwzJLTLFqc,823257,826565,"@LaurenRPeters asks, ""If we have evolved from monkeys,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,826565,828553,"why are they not extinct?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,828553,829639,Mm.
HdwzJLTLFqc,829640,832600,"When new species evolve, it's not necessary"
HdwzJLTLFqc,832600,836199,for them to replace the species they evolved from.
HdwzJLTLFqc,836200,839650,"In fact, it's more common for new species to exist"
HdwzJLTLFqc,839650,843525,side-by-side with many closely-related species.
HdwzJLTLFqc,843525,848525,"@karu1402 asks, ""Is the number of genetically different"
HdwzJLTLFqc,848650,851310,"human beings that can be formed finite?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,851310,854580,"People are often curious if there might be a doppelganger,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,854580,857190,someone almost exactly like them out there
HdwzJLTLFqc,857190,859620,"in the world today, or at some point in history,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,859620,862559,"and the fact is we can be pretty close, genetically,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,862559,866090,but every individual is indeed unique.
HdwzJLTLFqc,866090,869119,"When you consider the number of genes in the human genome,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,869119,872927,"20,000, 30,000, but also considering"
HdwzJLTLFqc,872927,877730,"the number of base pairs in those DNA molecules,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,877730,881769,you're talking about billions of different combinations.
HdwzJLTLFqc,881769,885597,"On top of that, it's not just the genes themselves"
HdwzJLTLFqc,885598,889170,"that are crucial, but how those genes are expressed."
HdwzJLTLFqc,889170,892503,All of those things can be different among individuals.
HdwzJLTLFqc,892503,895837,We're not going to run out of unique individuals
HdwzJLTLFqc,895837,897113,anytime soon.
HdwzJLTLFqc,897114,898957,"@IBIS_journal asks,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,898957,902089,"""What makes #penguin feathers ice-proof?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,902090,903901,They're not just ice-proof.
HdwzJLTLFqc,903901,907580,"They are waterproof, structurally waterproof,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,907580,911580,"and biologists still aren't sure exactly how that works,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,911580,914380,but if you look microscopically at the veins
HdwzJLTLFqc,914380,917742,"of those feathers, you see that they trap all sorts"
HdwzJLTLFqc,917742,921070,of small air pockets and it may be that air
HdwzJLTLFqc,921070,924280,preventing water moving through the feather.
HdwzJLTLFqc,924280,927006,That intricate feather vein has thousands and thousands
HdwzJLTLFqc,927006,929669,of individual places where the feather surface
HdwzJLTLFqc,929669,933920,is pushing against the natural surface tension of the water.
HdwzJLTLFqc,933920,936149,"Either way, you don't have to worry"
HdwzJLTLFqc,936150,939517,about penguins getting wet on their skin.
HdwzJLTLFqc,939517,942640,"@r_heisman asks, ""What are some of your favorite"
HdwzJLTLFqc,942640,944729,unsolved mysteries in biology?
HdwzJLTLFqc,944729,946760,"Interpret however you like."""
HdwzJLTLFqc,946760,950990,One of the great mysteries that we've really only discovered
HdwzJLTLFqc,950990,955990,somewhat recently is just how mysterious our own genome is.
HdwzJLTLFqc,956050,960430,"When the human genome project sequenced our DNA,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,960430,963089,I think many people thought we would have
HdwzJLTLFqc,963090,968070,"the recipe book for how to make a human being,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,968070,970900,but it turned out to be far more complicated
HdwzJLTLFqc,970900,974350,"than anyone thought, because it's not just the sequence"
HdwzJLTLFqc,974350,977740,"of the genome, but it's the shape of the molecule."
HdwzJLTLFqc,977740,979010,It's the genes.
HdwzJLTLFqc,979010,983293,It's the patches of DNA around the genes that control them.
HdwzJLTLFqc,983293,987410,It's all sorts of things that combine to see
HdwzJLTLFqc,987410,991399,how those genes are expressed and what makes us human.
HdwzJLTLFqc,991400,995306,But you don't even have to go into molecular genetics
HdwzJLTLFqc,995306,996740,to find mysteries.
HdwzJLTLFqc,996740,998089,They're all around us.
HdwzJLTLFqc,998090,1000446,A constant reminder that there's so much
HdwzJLTLFqc,1000446,1004010,"to learn about ourselves and about nature,"

HdwzJLTLFqc,1007910,1011009,We still don't understand why people yawn.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1011009,1014779,"@michaelmccollor asks, ""How did Darwin know"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1014780,1016590,"all that evolution stuff?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,1016590,1017423,He didn't know.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1017423,1021404,He learned it as he traveled and explored his world
HdwzJLTLFqc,1021404,1025584,"because, in the 19th century, it was still widely assumed"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1025584,1030584,"that everything was created very recently, if you will,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1031180,1035130,"by the hand of God, and so Darwin was fascinated"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1035130,1039020,by geology and how there were species in the rocks
HdwzJLTLFqc,1039020,1043339,in fossils that were no longer present in the modern world.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1043339,1048339,"He came up with the idea of evolution by natural selection,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1048400,1051710,"would help explain how things changed through time,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1051710,1055289,"and how you had this great diversity of life on the planet,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1055290,1058110,and it was a radical idea at the time.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1058110,1060242,He sat on it for years and years
HdwzJLTLFqc,1060242,1063799,before finally publishing his theories because he knew
HdwzJLTLFqc,1063800,1065597,they would be controversial.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1065597,1069325,"@lonely_kino asks, ""What is bioethics?"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1069325,1071269,"The ethics of biology?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,1071270,1074040,"The answer is yes, and we need to think"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1074040,1078120,about the ethics of biology as our ability to do
HdwzJLTLFqc,1078120,1081090,more and more develops over time.
HdwzJLTLFqc,1081090,1085020,"Technologically, we have the ability now to change DNA."
HdwzJLTLFqc,1085020,1089120,"We have the ability to combine species in new ways,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1089120,1091370,"so we must constantly ask ourselves,"
HdwzJLTLFqc,1091370,1094980,"not only, ""Can we do these things, but should we?"""
HdwzJLTLFqc,1094980,1097090,So those are all the questions for today
HdwzJLTLFqc,1097090,1098814,and we've covered a lot of ground.
