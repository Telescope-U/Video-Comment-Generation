okpg-lVWLbE,1822,4699,that something is wrong with our system of education.
okpg-lVWLbE,4699,6240,But what is it?
okpg-lVWLbE,6240,8189,"Well, we send our children to school"
okpg-lVWLbE,8189,9924,"to prepare them for the real world,"
okpg-lVWLbE,9924,12811,"which is changing very, very fast."
okpg-lVWLbE,12811,14827,But our schools haven't changed much
okpg-lVWLbE,14827,16758,for hundreds of years.
okpg-lVWLbE,16758,19793,"In fact, thought leaders from around the world agree"
okpg-lVWLbE,19793,21472,that the current system of education
okpg-lVWLbE,21472,23452,"was designed in the Industrial Age,"
okpg-lVWLbE,23452,25890,mainly to churn out factory workers.
okpg-lVWLbE,25890,28120,And this Industrial Age mentality
okpg-lVWLbE,28121,30455,of mass production and mass control
okpg-lVWLbE,30455,33498,still runs deep in schools.
okpg-lVWLbE,33498,35331,Industrial Age values.
okpg-lVWLbE,36657,38699,"We educate children by batches,"
okpg-lVWLbE,38699,41562,and govern their lives by ringing bells.
okpg-lVWLbE,41562,45119,"All day long, students do nothing but follow instructions."

okpg-lVWLbE,52696,54385,"At school, you're rewarded for doing"
okpg-lVWLbE,54385,56899,exactly what you're told.
okpg-lVWLbE,56900,58773,These are Industrial Age values
okpg-lVWLbE,58773,61447,that were really important for factory workers.
okpg-lVWLbE,61447,63891,Their success depended on following instructions
okpg-lVWLbE,63891,66859,and doing exactly what they were told.
okpg-lVWLbE,66859,69346,"But in today's world, how far can you get"
okpg-lVWLbE,69346,71723,by simply following instructions?
okpg-lVWLbE,71723,74317,"The modern world values people who can be creative,"
okpg-lVWLbE,74317,76232,"who can communicate their ideas,"
okpg-lVWLbE,76232,78642,and collaborate with others.
okpg-lVWLbE,78642,80101,But our children don't get a chance
okpg-lVWLbE,80101,82568,to develop such skills in a system that's based
okpg-lVWLbE,82568,84651,on Industrial Age values.
okpg-lVWLbE,85769,88186,Lack of autonomy and control.
okpg-lVWLbE,89139,90765,"At school, our children experience"
okpg-lVWLbE,90765,93619,a complete lack of autonomy and control.
okpg-lVWLbE,93619,94972,Every minute of a child's life
okpg-lVWLbE,94972,97702,is tightly controlled by the system.
okpg-lVWLbE,97702,100319,"But in today's world, if you're doing important work,"
okpg-lVWLbE,100319,102223,then you're managing your own time.
okpg-lVWLbE,102223,103572,You're making your own decisions
okpg-lVWLbE,103572,107632,regarding what to do and when to do it.
okpg-lVWLbE,107633,110212,But life at school looks very different.
okpg-lVWLbE,110212,113881,"The system is sending a dangerous message to our children,"
okpg-lVWLbE,113881,116576,that they are not in charge of their own lives.

okpg-lVWLbE,118707,122620,instead of taking charge and making the most of their lives.
okpg-lVWLbE,122620,124340,Experts believe autonomy

okpg-lVWLbE,128731,131993,are bored and demotivated by school.
okpg-lVWLbE,131994,133367,Can you image how you would feel
okpg-lVWLbE,133367,134968,if you were told exactly what do to
okpg-lVWLbE,134968,137468,for every minute of your life?
okpg-lVWLbE,138309,140827,Inauthentic learning.
okpg-lVWLbE,140827,143051,Most of the learning that happens in schools today
okpg-lVWLbE,143051,145075,"is not authentic, because it relies"
okpg-lVWLbE,145076,148234,on memorization and rote learning.
okpg-lVWLbE,148234,150508,The system defines a generic set of knowledge
okpg-lVWLbE,150509,152480,that all children must know.
okpg-lVWLbE,152480,154353,"And then, every few months, we measure"
okpg-lVWLbE,154353,158504,how much has been retained by administering exams.
okpg-lVWLbE,158505,161170,We know that such learning is not authentic
okpg-lVWLbE,161170,164785,because most of it is gone the day after the exam.
okpg-lVWLbE,164785,168286,Learning can be much deeper and more authentic.
okpg-lVWLbE,168286,172539,It can be so much more than just memorization and retention.
okpg-lVWLbE,172539,174290,"But that's the only thing we measure,"
okpg-lVWLbE,174290,177437,and test scores are the only thing we value.
okpg-lVWLbE,177438,179896,This has created an extremely unhealthy culture

okpg-lVWLbE,187777,190833,that they will forget very soon.
okpg-lVWLbE,190833,194288,No room for passions and interests.
okpg-lVWLbE,194288,196562,"We have an extremely standardized system,"

okpg-lVWLbE,202100,205160,"This doesn't respect the basic fact of being human,"

okpg-lVWLbE,208461,211718,We all have different passions and interests.
okpg-lVWLbE,211718,213299,And the key to fulfillment in life
okpg-lVWLbE,213299,215704,is to find your passion.
okpg-lVWLbE,215704,218308,But do the schools of today help our children
okpg-lVWLbE,218308,221552,find and develop their passion?
okpg-lVWLbE,221552,224484,There seems to be no room in the current education system
okpg-lVWLbE,224484,227435,for the most important questions in a child's life:
okpg-lVWLbE,227436,228724,What am I good at?
okpg-lVWLbE,228724,230908,What do I want to do in life?
okpg-lVWLbE,230908,233352,How do I fit into this world?
okpg-lVWLbE,233352,235915,The system doesn't seem to care.
okpg-lVWLbE,235915,238129,There are so many greatly talented people
okpg-lVWLbE,238130,241171,who failed in the traditional school system.
okpg-lVWLbE,241171,244747,"Fortunately, they were able to overcome these failures."
okpg-lVWLbE,244747,247071,But not everyone can.
okpg-lVWLbE,247072,249206,"We have no measure for how much talent,"
okpg-lVWLbE,249206,253372,how much potential goes unrecognized in the current system.
okpg-lVWLbE,254907,257239,Differences in how we learn.
okpg-lVWLbE,258117,260696,"Each of us is also different in how we learn,"
okpg-lVWLbE,260696,263077,"in how much time we take to learn something,"
okpg-lVWLbE,263077,267488,and what tools and resources work best for us.
okpg-lVWLbE,267489,270571,But the system has no room for such differences.
okpg-lVWLbE,270571,272930,"So, if you're a bit slow in learning something,"
okpg-lVWLbE,272930,275414,"you are considered a failure,"
okpg-lVWLbE,275414,279581,when all you needed was a bit more time to catch up.

okpg-lVWLbE,284322,286419,for more than five hours a day.
okpg-lVWLbE,286420,289414,But there are a few big problems with lecturing.
okpg-lVWLbE,289414,292237,Sal Khan from Khan Academy calls lecturing

okpg-lVWLbE,299797,301668,"Also, in any given classroom,"
okpg-lVWLbE,301668,304979,different students are at different levels of understanding.
okpg-lVWLbE,304979,306648,"Now, whatever the teacher does,"
okpg-lVWLbE,306648,307964,there are bound to be students
okpg-lVWLbE,307964,309939,"who are either bored because they're ahead,"
okpg-lVWLbE,309939,312535,or confused because they're behind.
okpg-lVWLbE,312535,314682,"Because of the Internet and digital media,"
okpg-lVWLbE,314682,316316,our children have at their fingertips
okpg-lVWLbE,316316,318544,all the information in the world.
okpg-lVWLbE,318544,319950,Technology has made it possible
okpg-lVWLbE,319950,322245,"for anyone to learn anything,"
okpg-lVWLbE,322245,324354,"but for fear of losing control,"
okpg-lVWLbE,324355,328522,the system is not leveraging these incredible resources.
okpg-lVWLbE,329554,331094,"Our system of education,"
okpg-lVWLbE,331094,332871,"which evolved in the Industrial Age,"
okpg-lVWLbE,332871,336107,has become outdated and ineffective.
okpg-lVWLbE,336107,338694,"If we want to prepare our children for the modern world,"
okpg-lVWLbE,338694,342061,"if we want learning to be effective and engaging,"
okpg-lVWLbE,342061,344395,then there's no doubt that we need to

okpg-lVWLbE,304979,306648,"Now, whatever the teacher does,"
okpg-lVWLbE,306648,307964,there are bound to be students
okpg-lVWLbE,307964,309939,"who are either bored because they're ahead,"
okpg-lVWLbE,309939,312535,or confused because they're behind.

okpg-lVWLbE,318544,319950,Technology has made it possible

okpg-lVWLbE,336107,338694,"If we want to prepare our children for the modern world,"
okpg-lVWLbE,338694,342061,"if we want learning to be effective and engaging,"
okpg-lVWLbE,342061,344395,then there's no doubt that we need to
okpg-lVWLbE,344395,348145,fundamentally change our system of education.
