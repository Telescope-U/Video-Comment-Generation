2aDyjJ5wj64,1199,7279,hi everyone it's peter here from lucid  motors  as you may be aware we recently achieved
2aDyjJ5wj64,7279,15440,a landmark 520 miles range on an epa  cycle with our lucid air dream edition
2aDyjJ5wj64,15440,22400,and i really just wanted to take you  through some of the technologies that's  enabled that and maybe give away one or
2aDyjJ5wj64,22400,27000,two little secrets in so doing
2aDyjJ5wj64,29360,37289,[Music]
2aDyjJ5wj64,37600,44239,so let's start with some science basics  and this isn't aimed at hardcore  engineers you'll know that sort of stuff
2aDyjJ5wj64,44239,50960,but i really want to  progress the narrative to more the  interested lay person who's eager to
2aDyjJ5wj64,50960,56000,learn about electric cars and how they  work  so let's look at
2aDyjJ5wj64,56000,61199,energy  and power these are often so  misconstrued
2aDyjJ5wj64,61199,68479,well energy really is the work done my  old physics teacher would tell me have i  got the energy to walk up that hill have
2aDyjJ5wj64,68479,73920,i got the energy to get to that position  but a younger fitter guy than me would
2aDyjJ5wj64,73920,81280,be able to run up that hill and get  there faster  so he's able to expend that energy in a
2aDyjJ5wj64,81280,88240,shorter time  why because he's more powerful  so let's look at these units
2aDyjJ5wj64,88240,93280,of energy and power because it's  fundamental to understand this before we
2aDyjJ5wj64,93280,98960,can look at the battery technology that  really powers lucid air so what is the
2aDyjJ5wj64,98960,106720,unit of power it's actually the watt  and it's expressed typically as a letter
2aDyjJ5wj64,106720,113759,w  now a watt is a tiny unit of power so in  electric vehicle terms we tend to use
2aDyjJ5wj64,113759,120320,kilowatts which is thousands of watts  and interestingly what is the  relationship between that and a
2aDyjJ5wj64,120320,126240,horsepower well actually one horsepower  as determined by james watt many many
2aDyjJ5wj64,126240,131280,years ago is  746 watts so
2aDyjJ5wj64,131280,138560,a horsepower is about three-quarters  of a kilowatt it's actually the same  thing just a different term for it
2aDyjJ5wj64,138560,143599,alternatively you can say what is a  kilowatt it's about one and a third
2aDyjJ5wj64,143599,151200,horsepower very easy math because that's  very close the 746 is very close to 750.
2aDyjJ5wj64,151200,157920,so now how do we relate that's power how  do we relate that to energy
2aDyjJ5wj64,157920,164000,well we use a unit of  kilowatt  hours
2aDyjJ5wj64,164000,169120,and that's the energy  that we have in a battery pack and why
2aDyjJ5wj64,169120,176720,we multiply by hours because  that  links power and energy through time
2aDyjJ5wj64,176720,182480,however the scientific unit for energy  is actually a jewel it's a thing called
2aDyjJ5wj64,182480,189040,a jewel  now  we link  watts to joules because one watt
2aDyjJ5wj64,189040,195280,equals one  joule  per second  and you may ask why i've got this
2aDyjJ5wj64,195280,200720,delicious apple here  which i'm tempted to take a bite out of  but there's a reason
2aDyjJ5wj64,200720,207840,this apple weighs about a tenth of a  kilogram  it weighs about one newton
2aDyjJ5wj64,207840,212959,from isaac newton  and if i take this apple and i place it
2aDyjJ5wj64,212959,219360,on the floor  and i pick it up from about a meter to  this table and place it on the table
2aDyjJ5wj64,219360,225680,we've moved one newton through  one meter  and that defines what a jewel is
2aDyjJ5wj64,225680,232879,and if i do that  in exactly one second  i've been exerting a power on that apple
2aDyjJ5wj64,232879,240239,of exactly one watt so now the question  is how do we link  that joule that tiny amount of energy of
2aDyjJ5wj64,240239,247680,moving that apple up to how many joules  there are  in our lucid air battery pack and
2aDyjJ5wj64,247680,254480,actually the math  is surprisingly simple  because in the case of our grand touring
2aDyjJ5wj64,254480,260799,car  we have  112 kilowatt hours so we need to  multiply that
2aDyjJ5wj64,260799,267360,by 1000  and we also have to remember that joules  and watts are linked with seconds so we
2aDyjJ5wj64,267360,273520,need to say that's kilowatt hours so we  need to multiply that by 3600
2aDyjJ5wj64,273520,279040,because that's the number of seconds in  an hour and we actually come to a number
2aDyjJ5wj64,279040,284720,which is very close  to 400 mega
2aDyjJ5wj64,284720,289840,joules  what does that mean  unbelievably
2aDyjJ5wj64,289840,297360,i'd have to pick this apple  on the floor and put it on the table  400 million times
2aDyjJ5wj64,297360,302720,to represent the energy  in a full charge of a lucidaire grand
2aDyjJ5wj64,302720,308479,touring  and i'd like to present a fun fact  10 years ago
2aDyjJ5wj64,308479,315520,when i was working on tesla model s  we nearly called  one of the models of model s
2aDyjJ5wj64,315520,321039,the 300 mega joule it actually came out  as the 85 kilowatt hour but if you do
2aDyjJ5wj64,321039,326160,the math  300 mega joule now it would have sounded  cool but in the end we thought no one's
2aDyjJ5wj64,326160,331759,going to understand that it's too  scientific it's too techy people  understand kilowatt hours because
2aDyjJ5wj64,331759,336800,they're the standard unit of  energy
2aDyjJ5wj64,336800,343919,so  let's look at  how we determined what the size of the  battery pack should be for lucida
2aDyjJ5wj64,343919,349360,well to start with we really didn't know  but we did know about 10 years ago that
2aDyjJ5wj64,349360,355520,a reasonable electric car  would take  about 330
2aDyjJ5wj64,355520,362960,watt hours  per mile  and with the advancement over the last  10 years it was a reasonable guess
2aDyjJ5wj64,362960,369440,with our in-house technology we could  get that down to maybe 250 watt hours
2aDyjJ5wj64,369440,374880,per mile  and if we wanted to get a car  with them we were thinking maybe we
2aDyjJ5wj64,374880,380720,could get lizard air to 400 miles range  it's simple math it's times 400
2aDyjJ5wj64,380720,387360,and that would require  100  kilowatt hour pack
2aDyjJ5wj64,387360,393120,now  we decided to go for these  little beauties this is a
2aDyjJ5wj64,393120,399039,a cell a lithium-ion cell it's a 21-700  format
2aDyjJ5wj64,399039,407199,and typically  these contain  about  17 to almost 18
2aDyjJ5wj64,407199,414400,what hours of energy each  so then you can do some simple sums
2aDyjJ5wj64,414400,421360,it was clear with 17 to 18 watt hours  per cell that we'd require
2aDyjJ5wj64,421360,427599,almost  6 000  of these cells  to achieve
2aDyjJ5wj64,427599,432800,that sort of range  so before i go over to the skateboard
2aDyjJ5wj64,432800,439599,and the battery pack behind me and look  at the layout and how we incorporate  these cells in the car it is actually
2aDyjJ5wj64,439599,445840,fascinating to consider if the 17 to 18  watt hours in one of these cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,445840,451199,and with lucid air we can achieve with  grand touring 4.6 miles per kilowatt
2aDyjJ5wj64,451199,456720,hour  how far will the car go just from the  energy of one cell it's completely
2aDyjJ5wj64,456720,463440,hypothetical because the car won't run  with just one cell but how much range  does one cell get you
2aDyjJ5wj64,463440,469280,it's about 140 yards yes each of these  adding each of these cells there's
2aDyjJ5wj64,469280,477599,another 280 there's another 420 yard and  so we go  fascinating insight into the sensitivity
2aDyjJ5wj64,477599,484000,of range to number of cells but the name  of the game is to achieve that range  with ultra high voltage ultra high
2aDyjJ5wj64,484000,491120,efficiency and achieve it with a minimal  number of cells  so we realized we needed of the order of
2aDyjJ5wj64,491120,498240,6 000 of these 21 700 cells in order to  get a world-class range from the car
2aDyjJ5wj64,498240,504800,how could we integrate them in a manner  which was really compatible with the  interior ergonomics of the car and the
2aDyjJ5wj64,504800,510319,structure concept and to answer that let  me take you to our leap platform this is
2aDyjJ5wj64,510319,518000,it aluminum intensive skateboard  platform  lucid's electric advanced platform now i
2aDyjJ5wj64,518000,523120,hear you say lots of people claim  they've got skateboard concepts and  skateboard architectures what's so
2aDyjJ5wj64,523120,528560,special about this well the difference  is that this truly embodies the space
2aDyjJ5wj64,528560,534399,concept the space concept that really  differentiates lucid air from the  competition
2aDyjJ5wj64,534399,541200,in that the car is smaller and more  compact on the outside and bigger and  more comfortable on the inside and you
2aDyjJ5wj64,541200,548720,might think gosh how have you achieved  that we've achieved this with our  in-house  drive train technology motor inverter
2aDyjJ5wj64,548720,556080,transmission front and rear super  compact the most volumetrically powered  dense system available today
2aDyjJ5wj64,556080,562160,and as a result of that we've been able  to open up this space to make more room  for the occupants you might think that
2aDyjJ5wj64,562160,568399,makes it even more tricky to package the  batteries well paradoxically it does a  great favor because there's more room so
2aDyjJ5wj64,568399,574080,what we've done is sculpt the battery  pack around the occupant space we've
2aDyjJ5wj64,574080,580720,given the car a very slight tunnel here  between the front seats because that's a  pretty useless space in the first place
2aDyjJ5wj64,580720,587120,there's no tunnel at the rear because  that's really important you can slide  your feet through that's where you  shouldn't have a tunnel front tunnel's
2aDyjJ5wj64,587120,592800,great and we've double stacked the  height of the cells here underneath the
2aDyjJ5wj64,592800,599200,rear seat  so this is really a hybrid demonstration  model showing the two variants of
2aDyjJ5wj64,599200,604800,battery pack that power lucid air let me  show you those two variants and how they
2aDyjJ5wj64,604800,610959,differ  so here  we have  our the smaller of our two variants in
2aDyjJ5wj64,610959,616320,this one we have the foot garage where  we delete some cells and still the car
2aDyjJ5wj64,616320,623680,will be capable of over 400 miles in  this configuration but what it does  offer is this foot garage to make the
2aDyjJ5wj64,623680,630160,rear seating ergonomics even more  comfortable and they're pretty  comfortable with this 500 mile range
2aDyjJ5wj64,630160,637040,with a flat floor here but make no  mistake  this is more than competitive in the
2aDyjJ5wj64,637040,644480,marketplace  we have extraordinary unsurpassed  rear foot room and comfort even with
2aDyjJ5wj64,644480,650160,this version compared with other evs on  the market it's just that this one here
2aDyjJ5wj64,650160,657839,takes it to a whole new level and i'm  really excited this is the pack that's  going to power my passion to lucid air
2aDyjJ5wj64,657839,663360,pure  so there is an unsung hero in this
2aDyjJ5wj64,663360,669200,picture and that is the actual structure  the enclosure of the battery pack itself
2aDyjJ5wj64,669200,674480,because that does so much more than just  hold the batteries it contributes to the
2aDyjJ5wj64,674480,680160,entire structure of the vehicle and when  the pack is married to the body shell of
2aDyjJ5wj64,680160,686640,the vehicle it completes the safety cell  for the occupants in fact it provides a
2aDyjJ5wj64,686640,692399,safety self occupants and battery cells  it's a safety cell for cells as well
2aDyjJ5wj64,692399,699279,but it also significantly enhances the  structural rigidity of the car making  the car better handling and more refined
2aDyjJ5wj64,699279,705600,and it really stabilizes this central  structure for the crumple zones at the
2aDyjJ5wj64,705600,711519,end of the car to work to absorb energy  now also
2aDyjJ5wj64,711519,716639,you may note if you're eagle-eyed that  we've actually turned these modules and
2aDyjJ5wj64,716639,723600,it applies to all the modules kind of  upside down  we've got the electrical connections at  the bottom and the cooling at the top
2aDyjJ5wj64,723600,729120,there's a reason for doing that we allow  the cells to vent downwards and away
2aDyjJ5wj64,729120,734800,from the occupant for safety and also we  have this extra layer of coolant here to
2aDyjJ5wj64,734800,742560,give more safety  and let's just take a look at how this  system works if we move to 18 module
2aDyjJ5wj64,742560,748560,pack here and we see that this is  matched to these vents which allow hot
2aDyjJ5wj64,748560,754480,gases  to emerge from the pack  outwards and away from the occupants to
2aDyjJ5wj64,754480,762079,buy time in the event of a thermal event  now  also a key safety feature here of this
2aDyjJ5wj64,762079,767200,pack is this ballistic shield which is  eight millimeters thick and it is a an
2aDyjJ5wj64,767200,772399,advanced  epoxy composite  but  this
2aDyjJ5wj64,772399,780000,is not just performing a role of safety  it actually has an efficiency function  as well because this composite
2aDyjJ5wj64,780000,785040,undershield is actually curved  we've created a wing car
2aDyjJ5wj64,785040,790320,with a curved under tray to give  extraordinary aerodynamic performance to
2aDyjJ5wj64,790320,795680,enhance efficiency and range this is the  synergy the synergistic approach that
2aDyjJ5wj64,795680,801519,we've taken to engineering even key  safety features within our battery
2aDyjJ5wj64,801519,809680,enclosure  so this is where we lead to a modular  construction of our battery pack and for
2aDyjJ5wj64,809680,817760,many years now we've been the sole  supplier to the world championship  single-seater electric race series
2aDyjJ5wj64,817760,824880,through our old brand ativa and this is  one of the modules that powers those  racing cars it's extremely high-tech
2aDyjJ5wj64,824880,831839,state-of-the-art and we've accrued so  much learning  from this endeavor
2aDyjJ5wj64,831839,837519,and the wonderful thing is we've been  able to transfer that knowledge that dna  across to this
2aDyjJ5wj64,837519,844880,this is the mass producible  cost-effective  cousin of the racing module
2aDyjJ5wj64,844880,851040,with all the knowledge  integrated in it and this is the module  which forms the heart
2aDyjJ5wj64,851040,856399,of the battery pack for lucid air and  actually will be for project gravity
2aDyjJ5wj64,856399,863600,in a couple of years time  so this is  a lucid air battery module
2aDyjJ5wj64,863600,869680,and you see inside there we have 300 of  these 21 700
2aDyjJ5wj64,869680,876880,cells 300 per module  and we string  22 of these modules together
2aDyjJ5wj64,876880,884000,to achieve the 924 volts of our long  range pack and we string 18 of them
2aDyjJ5wj64,884000,889120,together in series to achieve a  756 volt
2aDyjJ5wj64,889120,894560,pack which is good for over 400 miles  range with the foot garage
2aDyjJ5wj64,894560,899839,on one side you see all the electrical  connections with this bus bar which is a
2aDyjJ5wj64,899839,905120,signature patent of lucid  and on the other side you see the
2aDyjJ5wj64,905120,911440,cooling manifold  which allows a water glycol coolant from  these inlet and outlet here to run
2aDyjJ5wj64,911440,917839,around  and cool this module  so i mentioned that we string
2aDyjJ5wj64,917839,924000,22 of these together and each of them  has  42 volts so we string
2aDyjJ5wj64,924000,930320,42 volts  times 22 modules together  to get the 9
2aDyjJ5wj64,930320,936560,24 volts  and each of these modules have 300 cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,936560,942480,so we multiply by 22 and we get  6600 cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,942480,948000,and in the case of the grand touring  that gives us a total pack energy
2aDyjJ5wj64,948000,954639,of 112 kilowatt hours  and in the instance of the dream
2aDyjJ5wj64,954639,960880,slightly different cell chemistry  we achieve 118  kilowatt hours
2aDyjJ5wj64,960880,966079,total pack energy now why should we go  for a high voltage like this many other
2aDyjJ5wj64,966079,972079,cars  are running at just 400 volts  well let's just explain this with some
2aDyjJ5wj64,972079,977759,simple  math  there's a classic formula ohm's law
2aDyjJ5wj64,977759,985360,voltage equals current  times resistance  and we can also link watts power
2aDyjJ5wj64,985360,990639,remember watts of power  and so power  there's a simple formula for that as
2aDyjJ5wj64,990639,996399,well  power is voltage  times current yes you just multiply
2aDyjJ5wj64,996399,1001440,volts by amps and you'll get watts  if you've got 100 volts
2aDyjJ5wj64,1001440,1007440,10 amps you'll get one kilowatt  so now we can actually substitute
2aDyjJ5wj64,1007440,1013600,in this formula from equation one  we can substitute for v and we can
2aDyjJ5wj64,1013600,1018880,insert i r instead of v from  equation two
2aDyjJ5wj64,1018880,1026079,times i  and we result in this classic  formula power is i
2aDyjJ5wj64,1026079,1031199,squared r  and this is an inescapable law
2aDyjJ5wj64,1031199,1036319,of electrical circuitry  and so
2aDyjJ5wj64,1036319,1043438,the heat losses are just proportional to  the current in amps  they're proportional to current squared
2aDyjJ5wj64,1043438,1048480,and this is a fundamental  and remember power is volts times
2aDyjJ5wj64,1048480,1055280,current  so we need a certain amount of power  we all want power
2aDyjJ5wj64,1055280,1061760,so if we double the voltage  we can half the current  and if we half the current
2aDyjJ5wj64,1061760,1067600,we can quarter the heat losses  this is a fundamental core tenet
2aDyjJ5wj64,1067600,1072960,of lucid drive to higher voltage  we've partnered with electrify america
2aDyjJ5wj64,1072960,1079600,with a thousand volt charging network  um we're using nearly all of that  there's a little bit of buffer in there
2aDyjJ5wj64,1079600,1085919,with our 924 volts  and you know  there's no substitute for voltage
2aDyjJ5wj64,1085919,1091600,in terms of efficiency  now  i want to just put to bed an urban myth
2aDyjJ5wj64,1091600,1097679,about batteries a lot of people say well  you can charge so fast because of the  high voltage
2aDyjJ5wj64,1097679,1104559,and it's partly true but it's super  misleading yeah we achieved over 300
2aDyjJ5wj64,1104559,1110160,kilowatts of power in an independently  conducted charging test very recently
2aDyjJ5wj64,1110160,1116320,and we've proven that with electrify  america we can accrue over 300 miles
2aDyjJ5wj64,1116320,1124080,range in just 21 minutes  this is unsurpassed  but there's kind of this myth that cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,1124080,1131039,charge faster because the voltage well  if we look at one of these little cells  here and if i'm a dumb little battery
2aDyjJ5wj64,1131039,1139440,cell like this  all i will see when i'm charging about  4.2 volts in a full charge at that end
2aDyjJ5wj64,1139440,1144799,and here  i will see zero volts  if i give it much more than that bad
2aDyjJ5wj64,1144799,1150799,stuff will happen if i don't give it  that won't charge very well  so each little cell
2aDyjJ5wj64,1150799,1158400,doesn't matter if the cars at four volts  a thousand volts could be a hundred  thousand volts each little cell doesn't
2aDyjJ5wj64,1158400,1163840,know the voltage of the car  all it receives is its individual
2aDyjJ5wj64,1163840,1169760,charging voltage around 4.2 volts  so then you think well hang on so if the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1169760,1176080,cells don't charge any faster whether  the car's 400 volts or 900 volts why are  you doing the 900 volts
2aDyjJ5wj64,1176080,1181360,it's the rest of the system it's the  rest of the system that sees the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1181360,1187039,benefits  of this increase in the voltage
2aDyjJ5wj64,1187039,1193280,and we look at this holistically for  example these connectors here on our bus  bars are made from aluminum they're not
2aDyjJ5wj64,1193280,1198720,made from copper  actually although silver is the most  conductive metal and if i was going to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1198720,1204559,make a money no object pack silver would  be my metal of choice but there's a cost
2aDyjJ5wj64,1204559,1212480,imperative at work here  um  copper actually is the best if you're  really limited in space but in terms of
2aDyjJ5wj64,1212480,1217760,mass effectiveness weight advantage  aluminum is fantastic aluminum's the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1217760,1223360,best choice and that's why we use  aluminum here in this application to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1223360,1228880,keep the weight of the pack down  so  look at this this 300 cells are all
2aDyjJ5wj64,1228880,1234400,wired together i can't see how this  results in a higher voltage it's very
2aDyjJ5wj64,1234400,1240720,difficult to relate the layout of this  when we see these 300 cells to the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1240720,1246960,voltage of the pack so how do we do that  so i've got some flashlights here as a
2aDyjJ5wj64,1246960,1253600,as a great sort of aid to understanding  and here we've got  uh a standard length flashlight and
2aDyjJ5wj64,1253600,1259200,these cells  are just 1.5 volts so we put three of  those together
2aDyjJ5wj64,1259200,1265280,in on end we just connect them and put  one after another
2aDyjJ5wj64,1268960,1279280,and what we have here is zero volts  1.5 volts  3.0 volts 4.5 volts and we end up with a
2aDyjJ5wj64,1279280,1286159,bulb at the end of this  this flashlight or torch as i  i was brought up to say which has got
2aDyjJ5wj64,1286159,1292799,four and a half volts  and lonely hull we can go for a longer  torch or flashlight as has got
2aDyjJ5wj64,1292799,1297919,four cells or we can go for six cells so  this one will have um that will have six
2aDyjJ5wj64,1297919,1305679,volts and then this one will have nine  volts  now  can you imagine if this is 9 volts
2aDyjJ5wj64,1305679,1313600,just how long  the flashlight would need to be  to achieve  924 volts i think this thing would be
2aDyjJ5wj64,1313600,1319919,about  probably about 50 foot long  so clearly connecting things that way
2aDyjJ5wj64,1319919,1326320,is is not the smartest we need to think  of another way  of connecting cells together and also
2aDyjJ5wj64,1326320,1332400,the way in a flashlight these just touch  each other and on end really is not
2aDyjJ5wj64,1332400,1337760,an efficient connection there's too much  resistance here it's not really suited
2aDyjJ5wj64,1337760,1343360,to the to the vibration regime that's  going to last the car for maybe 200 000
2aDyjJ5wj64,1343360,1349919,miles so we need to think of a different  different way of doing that  and also  we need to think about
2aDyjJ5wj64,1349919,1355760,each cell each one of these  is 4.2 volts as an open circuit voltage
2aDyjJ5wj64,1355760,1361039,to get to 924 volts you need 4.2 volts
2aDyjJ5wj64,1361039,1370640,and we need to put 220 of these  end on end  and the 220 results in our 924 volts so
2aDyjJ5wj64,1370640,1376520,we'd need to think of about a column of  these or a long flashlight super long
2aDyjJ5wj64,1376520,1382480,220 of these on end  to achieve the 924 volts but of course
2aDyjJ5wj64,1382480,1389039,that would only give us 220 cells which  is nothing like the 6600 that we need to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1389039,1394400,achieve the energy there wouldn't be the  energy in this pack  so we have to do something
2aDyjJ5wj64,1394400,1399440,as well in parallel  and that is literally put the cells in  parallel we need to create another
2aDyjJ5wj64,1399440,1404480,column of cells in parallel here  and it's like really
2aDyjJ5wj64,1404480,1410960,um  if i were to  bunch up a whole group of flashlights  and hold them all together
2aDyjJ5wj64,1410960,1416960,it's like  putting them in parallel  to connect  that way
2aDyjJ5wj64,1416960,1424080,so we need to connect in series and in  parallel  and we achieve that through the way we
2aDyjJ5wj64,1424080,1432559,connect  all these cells together  inside the module so let me open the  module up and explore
2aDyjJ5wj64,1434480,1440159,so  here we have the lucid air module  and this reveals
2aDyjJ5wj64,1440159,1446240,all the cells on end  300 of them  and what we do is we group them in
2aDyjJ5wj64,1446240,1451360,groups  of 30.  and we have this little membrane here as
2aDyjJ5wj64,1451360,1457200,a little bit of insulation and then you  can see that the next group of 30  runs through
2aDyjJ5wj64,1457200,1463679,to here so we have 10  groups of 30 cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,1463679,1469679,and each of those  steps each group of 30 steps up the  voltage
2aDyjJ5wj64,1469679,1476640,by 4.2 volts and because we've got 10  the voltage of this module is 42 volts
2aDyjJ5wj64,1476640,1483120,30 in parallel  10 in series  22 of these so we have
2aDyjJ5wj64,1483120,1491039,in engineering poland  we would describe this pack  as  a 220 s for series
2aDyjJ5wj64,1491039,1496640,and a 30 p  for parallel count that's how battery  engineer
2aDyjJ5wj64,1496640,1502400,would describe  the long range pack of a lucid air
2aDyjJ5wj64,1502400,1510080,so i'd like to just spend a little bit  of time showing our cooling strategy  here we use this plate and this cools
2aDyjJ5wj64,1510080,1515440,the cells from their ends this is an end  cooling arrangement
2aDyjJ5wj64,1515440,1523200,we think this has got many advantages uh  thermally and also in terms of  consistency of manufacturing and cost as
2aDyjJ5wj64,1523200,1528240,well and it's excellent way of  containing and managing the temperature
2aDyjJ5wj64,1528240,1533919,of the cells in certain cold weather  conditions we need to heat the cells up  we have to use some of their energy to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1533919,1540240,warm themselves and in hot weather  conditions  the cells actually sometimes need to be
2aDyjJ5wj64,1540240,1545440,cool not just by cooling through the  radiators but through the the compressor
2aDyjJ5wj64,1545440,1550559,loop on the air conditioning  now why do we choose this end cooling
2aDyjJ5wj64,1550559,1556880,rather than a  side cooling which is another approach  altogether well there's a very
2aDyjJ5wj64,1556880,1562240,interesting aspect of a cell if you look  at a cell this cylindrical
2aDyjJ5wj64,1562240,1570640,layout here  it's  thermally an isotropic what does that  mean it is actually able to conduct heat
2aDyjJ5wj64,1570640,1576799,in different directions at different  rates  it's really good at conducting heat
2aDyjJ5wj64,1576799,1584559,axially  but it's really quite  poor  at conducting heat sideways ah you might
2aDyjJ5wj64,1584559,1591440,say well what's that ratio it's quite  significant actually  we have this advantage this thermal
2aDyjJ5wj64,1591440,1598000,anisotropic nature  but of course the heat has to flow a  long way and we'll get an imbalance
2aDyjJ5wj64,1598000,1603279,between the temperature at one end of  the cell versus the other that's the  downside
2aDyjJ5wj64,1603279,1610720,but  we've got a real great advantage here we  can get a very clear consistent
2aDyjJ5wj64,1610720,1616640,area of contact  on this end  through a thermal adhesive that we layer
2aDyjJ5wj64,1616640,1622799,on here when we close this plate off and  this is very consistent and reliable and
2aDyjJ5wj64,1622799,1629440,mass producible and consistency of  manufacturing  and cost-effectiveness is critical in a
2aDyjJ5wj64,1629440,1637039,battery pack  now if we take the other approach  which is side cooling of these cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,1637039,1643039,we have a configuration of cells here in  a classic  honeycomb
2aDyjJ5wj64,1643039,1649120,yeah  but we have to make a little gap between  them  they won't go right close together
2aDyjJ5wj64,1649120,1656240,because in that configuration we need to  run a coolant channel
2aDyjJ5wj64,1656240,1661360,between them  down the sides  of the cells
2aDyjJ5wj64,1661360,1668960,and she said well tried and tested and  it's not a bad system and it's real pros  and cons here now of course with that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1668960,1675120,we need space for that channel so we  won't be able to achieve this
2aDyjJ5wj64,1675120,1681120,close compact honeycomb that we achieve  with lucid so here we're able to get
2aDyjJ5wj64,1681120,1686480,more energy more compactly this way but  we do have a little price to pay that we
2aDyjJ5wj64,1686480,1693039,have the cooling plate on the end so the  module is just a tiny bit deeper  whereas alternatively
2aDyjJ5wj64,1693039,1700399,the side cooling means that the module  like for like apples for apples in terms  of energy is a little bit bigger but a
2aDyjJ5wj64,1700399,1706000,little bit compact in its height  but there's a real downside to this
2aDyjJ5wj64,1706000,1713440,which is not  self-evident  to try to achieve a perfect fit
2aDyjJ5wj64,1713440,1721120,along the side of the cell here is  extraordinarily challenging at the best  of times let alone in mass production
2aDyjJ5wj64,1721120,1727360,and you tend to get funny tolerancing  effects coming in  and as a consequence of that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1727360,1734399,you tend to get  you know contact points i mean what  you'd want here is a pure perfect
2aDyjJ5wj64,1734399,1742000,contact point  running  over a big area  of the cell like that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1742000,1749279,that is very difficult to achieve  it's more likely you get  a couple of contact points
2aDyjJ5wj64,1749279,1755760,an interrupted  condition very tricky to achieve that  i'm not saying it can't be done but
2aDyjJ5wj64,1755760,1762559,super challenging for a consistent  effect so here you have  the cell not wanting to conduct heat but
2aDyjJ5wj64,1762559,1767600,he hasn't got to go so far  does want to conduct heat and you can
2aDyjJ5wj64,1767600,1774640,have a really consistent  a flat area but the heat's got to go  further and we've elected for that and
2aDyjJ5wj64,1774640,1782240,that's part  of the reason we're getting  extraordinary efficiency  so our philosophy is to end cool the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1782240,1787440,cells this gives us a more consistent  more reliable more manufacturable more
2aDyjJ5wj64,1787440,1794159,controllable system  and key to that is this cooling plate  this cold plate which is just a
2aDyjJ5wj64,1794159,1802080,two-piece aluminum stamping  and what you see are a lot of these  dimples here and these dimples are bonds
2aDyjJ5wj64,1802080,1808399,which hold the lamination of two pieces  of aluminum together to resist the
2aDyjJ5wj64,1808399,1813760,pressure of the water glycol which is  pumped in and out from these
2aDyjJ5wj64,1813760,1818799,unions  but these dimples provide another  function
2aDyjJ5wj64,1818799,1824399,they create a turbulent effect to the  water flow the flow of water comes in
2aDyjJ5wj64,1824399,1830320,here and goes right around this race  track and then out here
2aDyjJ5wj64,1830320,1835760,so why do we want to induce this  turbulent effect and the reason is that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1835760,1841520,if we induce a turbulent boundary layer  to the fluid flow
2aDyjJ5wj64,1841520,1846799,it enhances the conductivity  at that surface
2aDyjJ5wj64,1846799,1853760,and we want  maximum conductivity we need a fluid  which can absorb a lot of heat and
2aDyjJ5wj64,1853760,1860720,collect a lot of heat and transmit a lot  of heat very quickly  super cost effective super
2aDyjJ5wj64,1860720,1866399,manufacturable and a key element of how  we take a step forward to mass
2aDyjJ5wj64,1866399,1871840,industrialize the electric car with  technology like this which is designed
2aDyjJ5wj64,1871840,1877360,to be made by the millions of units  that's how we're going to drive the cost  down and that's what's going to help
2aDyjJ5wj64,1877360,1883279,save the planet  so last but not least is how we wire all
2aDyjJ5wj64,1883279,1890080,these cells together remember we've got  10 groups of 30 in parallel now when we
2aDyjJ5wj64,1890080,1895120,look at the the flashlight we look at  the negative being on one end of the  cell
2aDyjJ5wj64,1895120,1902000,and the positive on the other but  there's an interesting feature of these  lithium-ion cylindrical cells is that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1902000,1910240,the negative comes all the way around  right to the top  so let me just illustrate that
2aDyjJ5wj64,1911120,1917759,cell here  so not only is that negative
2aDyjJ5wj64,1919519,1926640,and that's the positive end there  but right around to this lip here
2aDyjJ5wj64,1926640,1933600,that's negative  and remember we want to link negative to  positive negative to positive to step up
2aDyjJ5wj64,1933600,1939279,the voltage  so we don't actually have to use one end  to connect positive and the other to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1939279,1944960,connect negative we can actually put  both connections  at the same end of the cell and that's
2aDyjJ5wj64,1944960,1950000,what we do so that we can have the  cooling on the one end of the cell here
2aDyjJ5wj64,1950000,1956799,and we have to all the electrical  connections the positive and the  negative here
2aDyjJ5wj64,1956799,1962480,and in order to span across  these rows these three rows of 10
2aDyjJ5wj64,1962480,1968320,cells in that series group we have this  bus bar configuration these aluminum
2aDyjJ5wj64,1968320,1976159,brush bars and this is all integrally  molded in this single shot  injection molding this entire assembly
2aDyjJ5wj64,1976159,1982799,these are not these bus bars are not  glued in  they're actually encapsulation molded
2aDyjJ5wj64,1982799,1988840,in this plastic injection molding and  it's an absolute breakthrough it's a  one-shot deal it's going to
2aDyjJ5wj64,1988840,1994080,revolutionize mass industrialization  of the semi-structural modules but let
2aDyjJ5wj64,1994080,1999279,me show you in detail how we do that and  how our learning
2aDyjJ5wj64,1999279,2004320,from our racing experience has really  helped
2aDyjJ5wj64,2004320,2010960,we know that resistance in the system is  our enemy  i squared r i squared is terrible we
2aDyjJ5wj64,2010960,2016840,want to reduce resistance so what we do  is  we have different
2aDyjJ5wj64,2016840,2022799,gauge bonds for negative and positive  we put
2aDyjJ5wj64,2022799,2028399,a thinner  bonding wire  here
2aDyjJ5wj64,2028799,2035360,and we put a thicker bonding wire  yeah  i'm giving away one of our big secrets
2aDyjJ5wj64,2035360,2042399,here this is how we reduce the heat  losses in a lucid pack the best of my  knowledge no one else has done this
2aDyjJ5wj64,2042399,2050480,this is really proprietary stuff when we  learnt this from motor racing because  you only need one fuse per cell not two
2aDyjJ5wj64,2050480,2056240,so how dumb is it to put two fuses on  both of which incur resistance we can
2aDyjJ5wj64,2056240,2061440,have a thick one which really saves us  on energy and minimizes heating loss
2aDyjJ5wj64,2061440,2066480,that way we can have smaller radiators  and we put a thin one  we have to give it a little bit of
2aDyjJ5wj64,2066480,2072638,resistance lose energy that one but  that's the safety valve and really  that's one of the keys to making this
2aDyjJ5wj64,2072638,2078000,the most efficient car in the world  finally a little word about our battery
2aDyjJ5wj64,2078000,2085520,management system here integrated into  this module  is our bms computer system a distributed
2aDyjJ5wj64,2085520,2092000,system  and what this really does is  multi-functions but i can give you uh  just a flavor
2aDyjJ5wj64,2092000,2098480,of how vital this  management system is  if you look at the battery pack we go
2aDyjJ5wj64,2098480,2105200,from zero volts at one cell through 220  steps up to 924 so what we need to do is
2aDyjJ5wj64,2105200,2112880,create this staircase  of voltage  and there's 220 steps on the staircase
2aDyjJ5wj64,2112880,2118720,of voltage and each one of those steps  is 4.2 volts in a full charge now we can
2aDyjJ5wj64,2118720,2124560,have lazy cells lazy groups of cells  and they might not all do their line
2aDyjJ5wj64,2124560,2131760,share of the work  what we need to do with our battery  management system  is iron out and even out that those
2aDyjJ5wj64,2131760,2137599,steps of voltages are equally spaced  that we don't achieve an imbalance in
2aDyjJ5wj64,2137599,2142720,the system this is just one of the key  attributes of our bms
2aDyjJ5wj64,2142720,2147760,and really it is as much a software  discipline as hardware and this is all
2aDyjJ5wj64,2147760,2153119,integrated into this module you can just  see  up close
2aDyjJ5wj64,2153119,2159119,the green tabs from the end of our  printed circuit board and the wire bonds
2aDyjJ5wj64,2159119,2167680,at each of these voltage intervals  across to our battery management system  which computer controls this module
2aDyjJ5wj64,2167680,2174720,so i hope you found this interesting i  hope you found it i hope you're still  with me um and uh
2aDyjJ5wj64,2174720,2182160,it's been a real pleasure to take this  opportunity i wanted to do this for a  long time to really sort of uh advance
2aDyjJ5wj64,2182160,2189119,the narrative  of evs for all those who are interested  out there in this exciting new world
2aDyjJ5wj64,2189119,2196830,thank you so much  [Music]
2aDyjJ5wj64,2207280,2209359,you
