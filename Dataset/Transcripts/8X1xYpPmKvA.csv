8X1xYpPmKvA,47020,50413,- [Nexpo] I have discovered a series in the realm  of Local 58.
8X1xYpPmKvA,52155,55322,(eerie ambient music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,62660,70900,"A VHS archive of an ordinary broadcast company.  Animal Education, Storm Safety, Space Knowledge,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,70900,77810,"Artificial Intelligence, and  are among the topics presented to us in the form"
8X1xYpPmKvA,77810,83590,"of short, educational VHS guides.  Tonight, we will envelop ourselves"
8X1xYpPmKvA,83590,90435,within this [a t r o c i t y] fantastic educational series.  This is Gemini Home Entertainment.
8X1xYpPmKvA,90435,93435,(computer clicking)
8X1xYpPmKvA,96426,102157,(soft music)  (static hissing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,102157,110034,(man screaming)  (knocking on door)
8X1xYpPmKvA,115451,122860,"Oh yeah, I'm digging this.  (soft music)"
8X1xYpPmKvA,122860,129983,"On our plate tonight is an analog horror series  by an internet creator named Remy Abode,  birthed from an alternate reality gone awry."
8X1xYpPmKvA,130890,136260,"Containing events stemming from [t h e  d e p t h s  o f  h e l l]  the hope for a brighter future,  Gemini Home Entertainment"
8X1xYpPmKvA,136260,142840,is a video distribution company ready  to take you on an educational trip through various avenues  of life knowledge.
8X1xYpPmKvA,142840,151750,"What that knowledge is, exactly,  is unclear at this point in time,  but what we do know, is that something in their reality is"
8X1xYpPmKvA,151750,155252,out of place.  Something isn't right here.
8X1xYpPmKvA,156900,164880,"The series was birthed on November 13, of 2019,  and since then has built up to a total  of 16 videos, each with their own surprises,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,164880,170860,and each giving us a different piece  of the puzzle as to what's happening  within this world.  The guides appear to be presented
8X1xYpPmKvA,170860,178393,"in a VHS anthology format,  a far cry from the silent onlooking  and broadcast interruptions we experienced in Local 58."
8X1xYpPmKvA,179310,185513,"Whoever's behind Gemini wanted people to see this,  and everything within each recording is as it should be."
8X1xYpPmKvA,187310,194300,"Tonight on our plate, we have the following before us,  World's Weirdest Animals, Storm Safety Tips,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,194300,199883,"The Deep Blue, Artificial Computer Learning,  Our Solar System, Camp Information Video,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,199884,205574,"Lethal Omen, Wilderness Survival Guide,  Sleep Image Visualizer, Games for Kids,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,205574,212060,"Advanced Mining Vehicle, Deep Root Disease,  Monthly Progress Report, Christmas Eve Party,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,212060,216873,"Home Invasion Help, and last but not least,  Crusader Probe Mission."
8X1xYpPmKvA,218210,224406,"Because there doesn't appear to be any sort  of established timeline here, we're gonna tackle these in  order of their release date."
8X1xYpPmKvA,224406,229590,"If you can't tell, we've got our work cut out for us,  so pop open those Lunchables"
8X1xYpPmKvA,229590,234366,"and grab that Crystal Pepsi,  we're about to dive into some analog horror."
8X1xYpPmKvA,235900,243482,"This, my friends, is Gemini Home Entertainment.  (dramatic music)"
8X1xYpPmKvA,266083,268500,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,284430,290021,World's Weirdest Animals.  (ominous music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,292280,299110,"The video opens by showing us strange  and wacky wildlife that inhabits various regions  of Minnesota, like prairie chickens"
8X1xYpPmKvA,299110,304750,"and burrowing owls.  The overall pacing and layout  of the video are pretty simple,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,304750,310893,"with the names of the animals  being presented alongside a couple  of facts, all over some calm B-roll footage."
8X1xYpPmKvA,314298,316881,(upbeat music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,331640,337960,"The overall tone changes a bit once we make it  to the three minute mark.  Contrary to the prior animals, the habitat"
8X1xYpPmKvA,337960,343639,"for the one upcoming is denoted as ""everywhere"".  And if that weren't strange enough,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,343640,349123,"music is nonexistent from this point forward,  merely leaving us with an ominous dead air."
8X1xYpPmKvA,378960,383003,"And so, the next animal up  is something called a Woodcrawler."
8X1xYpPmKvA,384400,391020,"For the next couple minutes,  the video explains a bit more about them,  like the fact that they're found all over North America,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,391020,397690,"are excellent hunters, do not make any noise at all,  and prefer the homes  of large families for nesting."
8X1xYpPmKvA,397690,403903,"Apparently they ""adapt""  to this residential environment,  although it's unclear what exactly that means."
8X1xYpPmKvA,441492,444242,(static hissing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,450500,456230,"So, right in the middle  of episode one, we get a brief glimpse  of what we can assume to be a Woodcrawler."
8X1xYpPmKvA,456230,462241,"It appears to be some sort  of long-legged creature,  and I've got a funny feeling that it's actual body is much,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,462241,467979,"much larger than a human.  Curiously, the video also presented somewhat"
8X1xYpPmKvA,467980,474537,"of a paradox, claiming that ""you will hear screaming"",  but ""they stole their voices""."
8X1xYpPmKvA,476510,481810,"If we're assuming that the victims  of these so-called ""Woodcrawlers"", are humans,  then it leaves us wondering"
8X1xYpPmKvA,481810,487370,"what exactly they're doing to them.  Lastly, I find it interesting that this creature"
8X1xYpPmKvA,487370,493090,"was described as ""Nature's mockery"",  as that term could be interpreted  in a couple different ways."
8X1xYpPmKvA,493090,498139,"Are Woodcrawlers ridiculing our entire perception  of nature and how life within it functions,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,498140,505229,"or are they some kind  of absurd imitation of human life?  I could be way overanalyzing this first part,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,505230,510053,"but, I'm just curious why that's there,  considering how unnatural this creature looks."
8X1xYpPmKvA,514935,517685,(static hissing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,528890,535130,"In this next scene, we're outside  of that same house at night.  It's hard to make out,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,535130,540523,but we can notice people inside  of it this time.  Why?
8X1xYpPmKvA,546049,548799,(static hissing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,586753,591753,(camera thudding) (static hissing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,594310,601010,"Yeah, those aren't people are they?  (eerie ambient music)"
8X1xYpPmKvA,601010,607079,"So, with their bizarre, unnatural behavior, combined  with the caption claiming that they're ""fake people"","
8X1xYpPmKvA,607080,611373,it's clear that Woodcrawlers don't kill humans.  They imitate them.
8X1xYpPmKvA,612520,619570,"This effectively establishes synonymy between the two,  as their method  of ""adapting"", somehow involves taking over their bodies"
8X1xYpPmKvA,619570,623763,"and conforming, to the best  of their ability, to natural human life."
8X1xYpPmKvA,625210,632945,"As we've seen, though, their behavior is far from it.  They're incredibly tense, they can't properly interact,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,632945,637773,"and when faced  with an outsider that isn't one  of their kind, they attack them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,638810,644363,"They're an absurd imitation  of the human form, a true mockery of Nature."
8X1xYpPmKvA,653388,655971,(upbeat music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,673900,679337,Storm Safety Tips.  (soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,680210,687680,"Brought to you by a Harbinge Technologies, the focus  of this video is to help keep you  and your family informed on how to remain safe in the event"
8X1xYpPmKvA,687680,692759,"of a major catastrophic storm.  The steps outlined are pretty cut and dry,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,692760,698339,"with the first being to reinforce your home  by improving structural support, replacing roof shingles,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,698340,704760,"and fixing leaks.  Step two advises that you install  an early warning system, that, conveniently,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,704760,710550,"Harbinge Technologies makes.  According to the video, this Albedo Alarm"
8X1xYpPmKvA,710550,714893,will warn you ahead of time if a storm  or other danger is approaching your home.
8X1xYpPmKvA,716420,723850,"Interesting.  I wonder what that could be?  The third step involves building a storm bunker,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,723850,730890,"which should be, precisely, 18 feet long by 10 feet tall.  The tape then advises us to install a four to five"
8X1xYpPmKvA,730890,738633,foot wide aluminum hemisphere  and to place their Timbre shortwave radio next to it.  We're given no further context on why it should be there.
8X1xYpPmKvA,739580,745463,But it should.  (soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,763270,769190,"This next segment explains what to do during these storms.  It's first advised to take our family to the bunker,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,769190,776257,"followed by powering on our Timbre radio,  and remaining calm.  Oddly, when these steps are shown, conflicting statements"
8X1xYpPmKvA,776257,781740,appear below each one that seem to add nothing  to the table in terms of instruction.
8X1xYpPmKvA,781740,787360,"Rather, it tends to inflict the viewer  with doubt, with claims like ""Your home doesn't belong"
8X1xYpPmKvA,787360,793570,"to you now"", ""ignore all sound produced by the radio.  They're auditory hallucinations"","
8X1xYpPmKvA,793570,799769,"and ""your tears are filled with salt"".  If we took these statements away,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,799770,804800,"we wouldn't be losing out on anything  which makes me wonder why its there,  and who the hell wrote it."

8X1xYpPmKvA,882366,888263,"(soft music)  Listen, under your feet, crawling through the floor."
8X1xYpPmKvA,890490,897873,"It seems that this line is referencing Woodcrawlers,  which leads me to believe that this ""storm""  isn't the type we know of in a conventional sense."
8X1xYpPmKvA,898960,904260,"This, combined with immediate camera cut to lights  in the field, alongside that warning to return"
8X1xYpPmKvA,904260,909470,"to the bunker if we see them,  makes it appear that Woodcrawlers  and whatever's emitting these lights"
8X1xYpPmKvA,909470,917360,"are perhaps the same creature.  With this in mind, this leaves us  to wonder exactly this storm entails?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,917360,923513,"How often does it happen,  and most importantly, why is it happening?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,925027,927777,(dramatic music)

8X1xYpPmKvA,981240,986380,"Created by a Gyneva Production Company, the premise  of this one is simple."
8X1xYpPmKvA,986380,990470,Lighthearted education about various creatures and regions  of the deep blue sea.
8X1xYpPmKvA,992730,999959,"Towards the latter half  of the video, we cut to a section about the deep ocean.  The Mariana's Trench is introduced as a large,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,999960,1004083,"foreboding hole in the ocean floor,  described as the deepest place on earth."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1005230,1011310,"Following this, we can observe a cross section view,  introducing an even deeper  and more ambiguous region"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1011310,1018260,"of the ocean called the Demisia Tunnel.  And ominously, the depth here is unknown."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1021693,1024110,(soft music)

8X1xYpPmKvA,1091067,1095313,(eerie ambient music)  Nothing can live inside the Mariana's Trench.
8X1xYpPmKvA,1096250,1099973,"The same, however, can't be said about the Demisia Tunnel."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1101650,1108210,"Taking what we know  so far about Woodcrawlers, how they were introduced,  and the connection to them from Storm Safety Tips,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1108210,1113590,"I'm led to believe that this creature is perhaps,  a full body shot of one of them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1113590,1118620,"With this, we become aware  of their ability to exist on land, underground,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1118620,1123669,"and beneath the extreme pressure  of the ocean floor,  cementing them as a highly resilient creature"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1123670,1127743,"that humans, by all accounts, need to stay away from."

8X1xYpPmKvA,1171410,1178039,"This next entry involves a new,  state-of-the-art AI tech showcase.  The overview explains that it's been in development"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1178040,1183230,"for about four years, and is already highly advanced.  Curiously, this is"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1183230,1189940,"the only tape so far to start off  with absolutely no music,  which I found notable considering that in each video so far,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1189940,1196299,the music stops when an ominous revelation  is about to happen.  The AI showcase is laid out in the form
8X1xYpPmKvA,1196300,1202140,"of short stories.  Each iteration spans four lines of text,  and as we progress through this video,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1202140,1207780,"we'll find that what starts  off as unintelligible, quickly morphs  into something we're able to logically follow."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1214606,1220752,(static hissing)  (computer beeping)
8X1xYpPmKvA,1244431,1250679,"(ominous music)  As expected, this first story made little sense.  We can gather an overall idea"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1250680,1257273,"of what it's trying to convey through words like River,  a Secret, Death, and the names Jack and Mary."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1258930,1265639,"Iteration two expands on this a bit,  and reads the following: Jack leapt over the river."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1265640,1271563,Mary followed close behind.  They're searching for the secret place.  I hear you.
8X1xYpPmKvA,1272870,1279660,And with Iteration three: Jack leapt over the river.  There goes Mary down the stream.
8X1xYpPmKvA,1279660,1287006,The secret place will keep us safe.  The river flows  but not with water.  (static hissing)

8X1xYpPmKvA,1348411,1351578,(eerie ambient music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,1364213,1370850,"(ominous music)  Alright, so that was a lot to take in.  Those last two iterations diverted pretty heavily from the"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1370850,1374863,"original story, formulating a narrative  with tons of clues to pick apart."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1375950,1381350,"The story here surrounds two people named Jack and Mary.  We can assume that they're out in the wild,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1381350,1386981,"leaping over a river to get to a ""secret place"".  It's unclear what this secret place is,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1386981,1390882,"but for now, we can assume it to be a storm safety bunker."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1392010,1399450,"In iteration four, we get references  to a so-called ""voice from space"",  and in that same story, it's clear that Mary"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1399450,1406350,"has become something else.  This ""something else"" looks to be the product  of the hungry eye that's referenced thereafter,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1406350,1410653,"however by this point in the video, we're unsure  of what exactly that is."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1412270,1418500,"Something else I found interesting was this small detail.  At the beginning, we're told we're going"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1418500,1425693,"to explore three iterations of short stories by this AI.  In reality, we received five."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1426980,1433809,"This leaves us with two options on why this is.  Either an external party had tampered  with the video or this computer,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1433810,1440943,"or this AI is somehow advanced enough  to make decisions on its own.  Personally, I'm led to believe the former,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1441950,1449410,"and this is why.  As we can see, the structure  of these stories takes place in third person."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1449410,1456070,"During iterations two, four,  and five, however, we receive specific lines  of text that address either us,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1456070,1461723,"or Jack, in the first person.  And after stringing these together,  we gain an interesting result."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1463820,1469520,"I hear you.  Jack, do you see me?  I have become something else."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1469520,1473223,Do you see the hungry eye?  Here I am.
8X1xYpPmKvA,1475120,1480622,"With this context, I want you to listen, very carefully,  to that last iteration once more."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1486893,1489809,(computer beeping)
8X1xYpPmKvA,1501710,1507349,"There is some sort  of voice coming through the broadcast.  It's extremely muffled, however it's clear"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1507349,1512549,"that something is either interfering,  or feeding information to this AI."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1512550,1520710,"And personally, I'm led to believe that it's Mary.  She and Jack are not just filler names for these stories."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1520710,1525503,"They're actual people,  and I'm going to infer that the story  presented actually happened."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1527160,1532690,"Moving on.  Towards the video's end, we observed it glitch  into two diagrams."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1532690,1539420,"Given the references to the voice from space  and the moving stars, I'm led to believe  that these two circles represent planets."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1539420,1545263,"The larger appears to be the hungry eye,  being denoted as alive, with intent."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1546580,1552640,"It seems to be hyperfocusing on a smaller planet  which we can assume to be Earth,  and in the second diagram,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1552640,1558100,"we can observe the effects that this eye is having on us.  Somehow, it's projecting some sort"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1558100,1563940,"of vessel down to Earth,  and once it makes contact,  it mutates into the creatures we've been seeing thus far."
8X1xYpPmKvA,1564970,1570330,"It's clear that there's something larger at play here  and there's a lot of context that we're still missing,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1570330,1574153,so let's press on to see what else Gemini has for us.
8X1xYpPmKvA,1584609,1587026,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,1604924,1611909,"(soft music)  When we shift gears to Our Solar System,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1611910,1618729,"we're able to learn a few facts about the various planets.  A diagram greets us, encompassing the Sun, Mercury, Venus,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,1618729,1622103,"Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune."

8X1xYpPmKvA,1929960,1936240,and even their original rustic cabins  for those feeling a bit more outdoorsy.  Each of these are beautifully decorated

8X1xYpPmKvA,2013030,2018780,"Following this, we get a mention  of Skinwalkers, that were allegedly sighted  during the same time period."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2019720,2025340,"For those unaware, Skinwalkers are a type  of shapeshifting humanoid creature  that's able to inhabit the form"

8X1xYpPmKvA,2126190,2131651,"was coming from Woodcrawlers,  and given the photo of them,  we're able to finally establish a scale"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2131651,2137730,for how gargantuan these creatures can be.  I'm going to conject that the Woodcrawler we saw
8X1xYpPmKvA,2137730,2143100,in World's Weirdest Animals was much younger  than the ones we're seeing here in Moonlight Acres.
8X1xYpPmKvA,2143100,2149723,"While we're currently unsure  of what their lifespan is,  we know that this one surely wouldn't fit into a house."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2150820,2157475,"Given the campground's mythology,  with the stories about the strange men that co-existed  with so-called Skinwalkers in the 1930s,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2157475,2165160,this implies that these creatures  have been here for decades.  But this leaves us to wonder what they've been doing
8X1xYpPmKvA,2165160,2172119,"and how they've upheld the status  of mere campground mythology for so long.  We know the original staff opened their doors,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2172120,2177203,"likely being killed or transformed into fake people  and resulting in the campgrounds original closure,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2177204,2185019,but where have they been since then?  What is clear is that Moonlight Acres is back open.
8X1xYpPmKvA,2185020,2190560,"Now advertising burrow-free cabins  and having a clear awareness  of these creatures existing,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2190560,2195513,someone gave it the green light.  But who?

8X1xYpPmKvA,2242150,2247530,"about various safety measures to take when out in the wild.  We learn which equipment to bring,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2247530,2254599,"and are then presented  with various natural hazards to be aware of,  like thorns, ditches, various animals,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2254600,2257663,and what to do if we ever come face-to-face  with a bear.
8X1xYpPmKvA,2260244,2262661,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,2287100,2294650,There's our skinwalker.  So we now know that Woodcrawlers can not only kill
8X1xYpPmKvA,2294650,2300093,"and inhabit the bodies of humans,  but animals too.  Interesting."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2301810,2307030,"Following this section, we're greeted  with numerous florae  and their impacts on humans."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2307030,2313300,"Among these, are poison ivy,  which causes rashes, itching, swelling, and blisters."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2313300,2319700,"Water Hemlock which causes trembling,  convulsions, respiratory failure, and death."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2319700,2326390,"And lastly, something called Nature's Mockery.  Not the Woodcrawler description we saw earlier,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2326390,2333220,"but the actual, proper Nature's Mockery.  Its effects on humans encompass hallucinations,"

8X1xYpPmKvA,2431705,2437390,"(eerie ambient music)  - [Narrator] One of the most disturbing,  and unethical aspects  of this video was the description"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2437390,2443650,"of a human pleading for help.  Clearly they were desperately in need,  however the video plays it off,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2443650,2449533,persuading you that this human being  that's probably on the brink of death is nothing  but an auditory hallucination.
8X1xYpPmKvA,2450870,2457613,"Knowing what we know about Fake People  and their conformity to human life,  I understand that this could very easily be one of them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2458920,2465609,But what if it isn't?  We're presented with a catch-22 here.  If we risk our own life to help this person
8X1xYpPmKvA,2465610,2472540,"and they're not a fake person,  then we've done something good  and helped save a life.  But if we assume that it's a fake person"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2472540,2476860,"without ever confirming it, we'll never know any better  and they'd be left to die."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2478070,2483470,It's a tactic of manipulation.  Gemini Home Entertainment has planted a seed in the heads
8X1xYpPmKvA,2483470,2492881,"of whoever watches this,  and it effectively contributes to a moral apprehension,  a panic, per se, in which you truly, cannot trust anyone."

8X1xYpPmKvA,2747270,2753980,that there's some sort  of military intervention at play here.  It should be noted that  there have been absolutely zero references
8X1xYpPmKvA,2753980,2759363,"to government involvement thus far,  however given the circumstances, it would make sense."
8X1xYpPmKvA,2760420,2766784,"Keep this in mind.  We'll come back to it.  Anyway, a few moments later, we encounter what seems"

8X1xYpPmKvA,2846400,2854190,It appears to me that the basement we sought refuge  in followed every single protocol  that Harbinge outlined back in Storm Safety Tips.

8X1xYpPmKvA,2865010,2872320,"which leaves me curious if Harbinge made their guide  in good faith.  If we can recall, there was a double purpose"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2872320,2879320,"to their video, not only were they giving advice,  but they were also selling products like the Timbre Radio,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2879320,2884569,"and the Albedo Alarm.  From an outside perspective,  they appeared to be capitalizing on mass panic"

8X1xYpPmKvA,2959090,2966100,"there's a problem.  And it aint just Woodcrawlers.  Interestingly this section occurred at twilight,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2966100,2972050,which mirrors the various other references  we've seen to Woodcrawler activity.  The fields.
8X1xYpPmKvA,2972050,2977383,"The fake people.  The knocking.  If there's something I'd takeaway here,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,2977383,2983773,"it's that it seems like these creatures are more active,  more violent when the sun goes down."

8X1xYpPmKvA,3012050,3018109,"discovering its hidden lore,  and unlocking each of the five endings awaiting you.  I'm going to go over them now,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3018110,3024293,"so if you'd like to play this for yourself  and keep things unspoiled, I'll give you 10 seconds  to skip forward to this timestamp."

8X1xYpPmKvA,3045530,3051020,"Like we established,  within ""Lethal Omen"", there are five different endings  to uncover."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3051020,3056243,"Before we get to those, though,  I wanted to take you into the campground  to explore the hidden lore awaiting us."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3064070,3070300,"We begin the game next to a highway outside  of Moonlight Acres.  Both ends of the road are blocked off,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3070300,3076563,"however we can observe two cars nearby.  One out in this field,  and another resembling a police car."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3077980,3083599,"We're tasked with collecting three keys,  and after doing so,  we're then granted access to the campground."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3085310,3092980,"One of the first things you'll notice  is this bulletin board.  It contains two notes,  and two strange images that are hard to make out."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3092980,3098349,"The first note informs us  of the ""Lights in the Sky"" event  taking place tonight at 9:30 p.m.,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3098350,3101523,"and the second informs us to bring our so-called ""SIV""."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3103450,3109670,"Moving inward, we're then greeted with six cabins.  In the first, we can observe headphones,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3109670,3114442,"a shortwave radio, a TV,  and a Gemini Home Entertainment VHS tape."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3116020,3121100,"In the second, we get much of the same.  This time, though, a stack of tapes"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3121100,3128053,"containing Storm Safety Tips  and other Gemini media are present,  however there is this one that I'm unable to make out."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3129510,3136040,"In the third, we can observe a TV playing a Gemini tape.  Here, we learn that an SIV is something"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3136040,3144349,"called a Sleep Image Visualizer, that we're required  to plug into a module.  And that same SIV module can be seen lying on the dresser."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3144349,3150780,"Given the name, it seems  that the SIV's goal centers around recording dreams.  For who, how,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3150780,3156990,"and why, we're currently unsure of.  But, interestingly, if we shoot this specific monitor,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3156990,3162029,"we're able to observe the SIV in action for Adam Levitch,  the former men's club supervisor"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3162030,3164233,that we know was transformed into a vessel.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3173360,3179950,"In cabin four, we can see that things are a bit messier.  On the TV once more is that SIV tutorial,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3179950,3187053,"and scattered across the room are numerous SIVs  and headphones, along with a tape  labeled Albedo Alarm Settings Video."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3188620,3195253,"Moving onto cabin five, we can observe a huge mess.  There isn't much to this one besides this SIV on the ground."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3196460,3203060,"And last but not least, cabin six.  This one clearly has been ravaged by something,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3203060,3208579,"evident by the large break in the floor.  Within it, we can observe that SIV tape, along"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3208580,3211973,with a SIV module and some sort  of strange plague surrounding it.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3214930,3221392,"Upon making our way back outside  and to the archery area, we're greeted  with seven targets along with our first enemy encounter."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3222350,3228922,"After taking them out  and approaching the targets, we're able to read snippets  of newspaper articles about the events  taking place at Moonlight Acres."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3232510,3238280,Campgoers distraught after Moonlight Acres' famous Light's  in the Sky event is abruptly canceled.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3238280,3244696,"If you've been looking forward to the Light's  in the Sky event this year at Moonlight Acres Family Camp,  don't be so hasty to pack your bags."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3244696,3250180,"The official Moonlight Acres website recently  updated, revealing that the event  has been abruptly canceled,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3250180,3257810,"with no reason given.  Campgoers are enraged, especially those who go  to Moonlight Acres every year simply to watch the event,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3257810,3263890,and demand an explanation for the abrupt cancellation.  The times asked Moonlight Acres for an interview.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3263890,3269950,They politely declined.  The other is partially covered making it a bit harder
8X1xYpPmKvA,3269950,3275250,"to make out,  but it seems to focus on the disappearance  of a person named Jordan Barnes."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3275250,3283523,"They were most likely Canadian,  and given the fact that this note  is beneath the one about the Light's  in the Sky cancellation, we can assume that this is why."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3284370,3292573,"Investigators are curious as to why so many  are worried about their disappearance,  pondering if they're victims of a so-called mass hysteria."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3295170,3300650,"Moving on, once we make our way  into the administrator's cabin,  we can observe numerous campground photos"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3300650,3306130,"covering the walls.  The first, amusingly, contains a Mario 64 reference,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3306130,3313740,and displays an aerial view of the campground.  The second shows the campground entrance from 1982.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3313740,3321553,"The third is a swimming pool, circa 1988.  And the fourth is a camp staff group photo taken in 1984."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3323090,3329110,"On the far wall are numerous other camp photos  that are unlabeled, and opposite this are shelves full"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3329110,3337263,"of VHS tapes.  Here, we can make out various Gemini videos,  however this specific one bears a name and date."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3338640,3344420,"Given what we know so far about the SIVs  and how they operate, I'm led to believe  that this is an archive"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3344420,3349920,"of numerous staff dreams.  Further inside, we find a shelf full"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3349920,3356330,"of TVs and a strange door that's floating on a wall.  Upon making our way up to it, we encounter"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3356330,3361980,"an unkempt attic full of discarded televisions,  and on the floor beneath them?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3361980,3364793,"Various notes, reading the following:"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3367017,3372100,"""It was looking into me.  Wants to eat the camp.  I fear the men may return."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3372100,3379140,My face is going away.  I hear voices.  The spot on my neck has grown.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3379140,3385270,There's a bonfire tonight.  I will stay in my bedroom.  Light's in the Sky is tonight.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3385270,3389567,"I've been told that the men will be present.  Maybe it will leave us alone now."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,3391920,3399210,"Something that stood out to me here was the reference  to the spot on their neck.  It seems to reference an infection that is slow-moving,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3399210,3403543,and there are absolutely zero references to Woodcrawlers  or any sort of creature.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3404720,3411090,"Given what we know about Nature's Mockery,  it doesn't seem to be that either,  which leaves me curious as to if there's another form"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3411090,3415653,of infection taking place here.  Something biologic.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3417620,3423050,"Moving on, if we make our way back outside  and head leftward, we encounter what I can assume"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3423050,3428100,"to be Nature's Mockery.  And within it, a heavily deformed human being,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3428100,3431433,giving us a visual as  to what this plant actually does to you.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3433780,3438323,"While examining it, the fake person we saw back  in the commercial gameplay spawns in."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3439415,3441063,And then we're told to run.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3444956,3451960,"(eerie ambient music)  And so, like we saw earlier, we make our way to the bunker,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3451960,3459077,"and from here, everything plays out as shown before.  (eerie ambient music)"

8X1xYpPmKvA,3509060,3512441,Help me!  Somebody!
8X1xYpPmKvA,3514131,3519773,Help!  - [Narrator] And we come to find that they're infected  with the same plague we saw in the cabin floor.

8X1xYpPmKvA,3529728,3530713,Help me!

8X1xYpPmKvA,3545359,3552593,"(crickets chirping)  - [Narrator] And that, my friends, is ending one."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3553970,3558543,"Play the game like the commercial,  and encounter the Iris staring into you."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3561383,3568230,"- [Man] Help!  - [Narrator] From here,  we're going to explore the other four endings."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3568230,3575480,"Clearly, ""Lethal Omen""'s lore is gargantuan, leaving us  with tons of questions  that we're currently unable to answer."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3575480,3579983,"I'm curious what else there is to find, though,  so let's head back in to uncover it."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3584458,3589750,"(eerie ambient music)  Moving on to the ending two,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3589750,3595849,"you once again begin the game as usual.  Collect the keys,  and fight the enemies, however this time, instead"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3595849,3601660,"of approaching the Nature's Mockery abomination,  you gotta make your way back to the administrator's attic."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3601660,3607559,"Once you're inside  and turn around to exit, though you're greeted  with a strange mannequin that tracks your every move."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3610544,3613711,(eerie ambient music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,3617640,3623632,"And after approaching it, you observe the following.  (gun firing)"

8X1xYpPmKvA,3646120,3652140,"To unlock ending three, you need to collect the keys,  kill the enemies,  and approach Nature's Mockery."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3652140,3657670,"This time, instead of making your way  to the cabin or bunker,  you're required to pass through this secret entrance"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3657670,3662373,to the family cabin area to claim  this hidden key that's also covered in that plague.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3663500,3669000,"After obtaining it, you make your way back to the front,  where you'll find this target that you're need to shoot."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3669000,3674410,"And after doing so  and heading to the highway the campground lies on,  you encounter an abandoned police car,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3674410,3684268,before the following plays out.  (eerie ambient music) (footsteps thudding)
8X1xYpPmKvA,3690462,3693129,(ominous music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,3700904,3703321,(gun firing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,3707190,3712600,"Ending four involves us making our way back in.  After taking out the first round  of enemies, we're required"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3712600,3719420,"to shoot each target before making our way back  to the entrance.  Curiously, we then find an opening in the treeline,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3719420,3725143,"and upon exploring it, we encounter a massive,  foreboding hole also covered in plague."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3726150,3730657,"Upon approaching it, we're able to hear the sounds  of creatures in the distance."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3735155,3741576,"(distant roaring)  And, of course, we do as any sane person would do"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3741576,3745063,"and jump in, giving us our fourth ending."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3746961,3749628,(ominous music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,3753400,3760070,"And last but not least, the true ending.  Here, we gotta do everything we've done prior."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3760070,3767910,"Keys, enemies, Mockery, plagued key,  and heading back to the front.  Curiously, we then see an opening in the fence line,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,3767910,3776013,"and after approaching it, we encounter a group  of enemies in a formation.  This time, though, they're not out to kill us."
8X1xYpPmKvA,3777010,3785113,They're waiting on us.  (eerie ambient music)

8X1xYpPmKvA,3991210,3996833,The hole.  The police car.  The ritual.  And the Iris.
8X1xYpPmKvA,3997890,4005300,"There is a ton to unpack  within ""Lethal Omen"", and the beauty  of it is that, when presented in a video-game format,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4005300,4010682,"you're left to encounter these on your own.  So, let's recap."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4011670,4017310,The role of the mannequins seen in the attic ending  is currently unclear.  It's important to note that they appear
8X1xYpPmKvA,4017310,4024084,"to have a much higher polygon count  than anything else found in ""Lethal Omen"",  but aside from that, hardly any further context"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4024084,4030240,"is given regarding their existence.  If I had to guess,  I'd say that they represent the strange men"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4030240,4035330,"that the camp admin referenced in their note.  If we can recall, right after reading it is"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4035330,4040490,"when we encounter them for the very first time,  leading to a potential connection between the two,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4040490,4047503,"however this is hitherto unconfirmed.  Moving onto the hole, this appears to be the byproduct"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4047503,4053140,of Woodcrawlers.  Their breadcrumb trail as they breach the confines of Earth.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4053140,4058682,"It's currently unclear what exactly that plague is,  but perhaps we'll find our answers in later uploads."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4059970,4065180,The police car seems to represent a victim.  The Police likely received calls
8X1xYpPmKvA,4065180,4070560,"of strange activity going on at Moonlight Acres,  potentially involving the missing Jordan Barnes,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4070560,4076960,"however after investigation,  they never made it out to reveal the truth.  There's a looming impression"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4076960,4080843,"that they're aware of Woodcrawlers,  but this is also unconfirmed."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4082670,4087483,"And lastly, the ritual, an embodiment of helplessness."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4088350,4095353,"After realizing that everyone around you is infected,  is a fake person, you lose all hope on fighting back."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4096380,4101454,"Police can't help you.  Camp admins answered the door, they can't help you."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4101454,4108862,"The bunker that's supposed to keep you safe,  that can't help you.  And a supermassive, sentient eye is looming over you."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4109750,4117003,"It goes without saying that in a situation like this,  fighting back is futile,  and the game communicates this by waiting on you."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4118270,4121933,"Get in, they beckon.  Give in."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4132100,4134500,- [Announcer] We'll return after these messages.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4137784,4140201,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,4178660,4185758,"- [Narrator] Alright, halfway there.  You still with me?  As we can see, there is a lot going on"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4185758,4191569,"with Gemini Home Entertainment.  We still have tons  of questions about the overall story here,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4191569,4197790,"but I wanted to circle back  and recap on what we know so far.  Refill your drink, heat up another popcorn,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4197790,4204621,"and get cozy, 'cause we're only getting started.  (dramatic music)"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4207530,4213000,"In review.  Within Gemini Home Entertainment,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4213000,4218280,"the entire story revolves around the Iris.  We know the Iris is a supermassive,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4218280,4226230,"sentient planet that entered our solar system  without humans ever knowing it.  When, how, or why it did is currently unclear,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4226230,4233923,"but what we do know,  is that it infected the neighboring ice giant Neptune,  turning it into something that is alive."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4235490,4244530,"Neptune has become somewhat  of a minion to the Iris, a vessel,  or lens that it uses to emit solar storms targeting Earth."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4244530,4250029,"Given the diagram from Artificial Computer Learning,  we can infer that  within these solar storms, are embryos"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4250029,4256963,"and seeds that mutate into Woodcrawlers  and Nature's Mockery upon landing on Earth,  the Iris' next target for mutation."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4258099,4264190,"Back home, the primary prey  of Woodcrawlers are humans,  but we know that they're able to inhabit the bodies"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4264190,4270843,"of animals as well.  Woodcrawlers are highly resilient  and clever, given their ability to imitate humankind,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4270843,4274833,although it's still unclear what exactly  they do to achieve this.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4276410,4282380,"On top of Woodcrawlers,  Nature's Mockery is introduced as the major florae  to steer clear from, and it's method"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4282380,4288818,"of infection appears to be via direct contact.  Somehow, at an unknown speed, this plant paralyzes"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4288818,4295253,"and disfigures whatever it comes into contact with,  leaving the victim in a vegetative state forever."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4296690,4304853,"At this point, we're currently unsure  if Nature's Mockery eventually kills you,  but even if it did, that's not much better."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4306470,4312960,"Within the Camp Information Video, we catch wind  of the mythology behind a campground called Moonlight Acres."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4312960,4318059,"Given that the strange, knocking men existed  at the same time as the so-called skinwalkers"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4318060,4324100,"in the 1930s, I'm led to assume  that this campground was  among the very first establishments to encounter the effects"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4324100,4329513,"of the Iris.  This explains why every single  original staff member died,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4331890,4336070,"well, except the admin.  They weren't listed."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4338320,4346030,"This point leads us into ""Lethal Omen"",  an archaic video game that cements  the time-period for Gemini somewhere in the 1990s."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4346030,4353680,"To me, the game seems to place us into the shoes  of that admin, taking us through their final minutes  within their desolate campground."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4353680,4360482,"The various endings seem to be symbolic  of the many ways they could've died,  but that true ending, the hopeless suicide"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4360482,4365052,"and transformation, that is the one that killed them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4367010,4371063,"Lastly, we have two characters, Jack Wylder and Mary."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4372020,4379340,"Admittedly, Mary's background has been elusive.  We can assume that she mutated into a Woodcrawler somehow,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4379340,4384420,and have made the tenuous assumption  that she's trying to communicate to Jack  through the REGNAD computers.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4385440,4392540,"Regarding Jack, he's a recurring character  throughout Gemini Home Entertainment.  Obvious references are made in the Wilderness"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4392540,4399520,"and AI videos, and, given the nature  of his work as a wildlife videographer,  it leaves me to wonder if he has more to do"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4399520,4404940,"with these tapes than they're letting on.  If we can recall, Worlds Weirdest Animals,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4404940,4412044,"Storm Safety Tips,  and Wilderness Survival Guide  all have strikingly similar shots  of video, so if he's the one behind these,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4412044,4417493,"clearly being attacked in the very first video,  we're left to wonder what happened to him?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4418530,4425210,"Where is he?  And so, alongside the abstruse nature"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4425210,4429363,"of Jack's role here, there are still tons  of questions left unanswered."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4430240,4437330,"Why do these tapes start off ordinarily,  but devolve into a disturbing mess?  Do each of the companies that Gemini Home Entertainment"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4437330,4442464,"distributes for have humanity's best interests in mind,  or is there something larger at play here?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4442464,4447630,"What exactly was that plague that we kept seeing  in ""Lethal Omen?""  Why are there stockpiles"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4447630,4454610,of SIV recordings in the admins cabin?  How exactly do Woodcrawlers infect humans?  Is the majority of humanity aware
8X1xYpPmKvA,4454610,4460928,"of this impending threat?  And most importantly,  why did the Iris enter our solar system?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4460929,4466093,"We know that it's there,  but we don't know how it operates  and what it's overarching plans are."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4468550,4473930,"What we do know, though,  is that Gemini Home Entertainment is aware of all of this."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4473930,4479619,"They know about Woodcrawlers, Nature's Mockery,  the plague, the deaths,  and Neptune's infection,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4479620,4483313,"but coincidentally, we know the least about them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4485150,4491760,"Clearly there's a lot  of context left to fill, so let's buckle down  and see what else Gemini has in store for us."

8X1xYpPmKvA,4537090,4542350,"For video nine,  we once again meet our good friends  over at Harbinge Technologies."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4542350,4549170,"This time, they're presenting an instructional guide  on how to set up a Sleep Image Visualizer,  a device in which we can assume to give us"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4549170,4557523,a look into the dreams of others.  We begin by orienting ourselves with the SIV Module  and headset before we move on to learn how to set it up.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4558610,4564870,"Interestingly, throughout this video,  we'll soon notice anomalous interruptions  that have been recorded over this tape."

8X1xYpPmKvA,4622570,4629739,"of a Levi Jacobs.  And within it, we witness  our first mannequin character outside of ""Lethal Omen."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,4629740,4635650,"No further context is given to why they're there,  but curiously, immediately after this dream sequence,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4635650,4639977,we can observe the same mannequin head being used  to represent a SIV client.

8X1xYpPmKvA,4740890,4747423,Levi Jacobs was asleep for four minutes.  Adrian Gordon was asleep for four minutes.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4748370,4752473,"Jack Dean, however, was asleep for three days."

8X1xYpPmKvA,4799282,4805739,"(eerie ambient music)  Alright, so throughout this one,  we received two references to the Iris."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4805740,4813363,"One being in the Goodnight sequence,  and another being within the dream  of Joseph Allen who never woke up."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4814920,4820350,"Interestingly, the video is very matter-of-fact  in claiming that these images do not represent reality"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4820350,4825820,"or the future, however it's clear to us  that they do represent the circumstances they're living in."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4827350,4832440,"Now, backing up, we've seen the name Jack  in the series twice so far."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4832440,4838050,"Firstly in Artificial Computer Learning,  and most recently in the Wilderness Survival Guide."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4838050,4843742,"His last name's different in this one,  but for brevity, just know that this is the same person."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4844850,4851740,"Over on the Gemini Home Entertainment YouTube channel,  they posted this image around the same time  the SIV video released."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4851740,4858920,"On the very bottom, we're able to see his full name,  and to the left, we can make out bits  of the story surrounding him."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4858920,4864580,"According to the article, Jack is a prominent TV personality  and wildlife expert."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4864580,4869643,"He had gone missing in May,  and his disappearance has been the subject  of a nationwide manhunt."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4870520,4876429,"He allegedly disappeared  while filming a new special aimed to protect  and enlighten what I'm assuming to be people,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4876430,4882181,"from what are most likely the effects of the Iris.  Curiously, the month he went missing"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4882181,4888529,"and the time period he underwent SIV testing are both one  in the same, which leaves us to wonder if, perhaps,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4888529,4895980,"this three-day slumber somehow led to his death.  While that is currently unclear, what is clear,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4895980,4902340,is that Jack Dean's Wilderness Survival Guide  and the World's Weirdest Animals videos  are distinctly connected.
8X1xYpPmKvA,4902340,4906563,"Two parts of the same series of videos, by him."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4908260,4914360,"With this in mind, we know he's been in the SIV,  and we also know that he's been attacked by Fake People."
8X1xYpPmKvA,4914360,4918143,"Either of these could've killed him, so which one was it?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,4919830,4920693,Where is he?

8X1xYpPmKvA,5148072,5154150,and following the lights  when the sun goes down are all thrown out the window.  We know that Woodcrawlers
8X1xYpPmKvA,5154150,5159893,"and Fake People are more active at night,  and advice like this does nothing  but ensure their demise."

8X1xYpPmKvA,5284320,5292170,"we observed numerous camera shots of the forest.  Interestingly in the third one,  we could observe a strange red light in the sky."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5292170,5298633,"It seems to match the eye that we've seen on Woodcrawlers,  and given the nature  of this game, it would make sense."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5299560,5306800,"Clearly, the woods are a threat.  A sort of eldritch location  that serves as a breeding ground for these creatures."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5306800,5311222,"And as with anything that is alive, they need to feed."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5313080,5319393,"Backing up, I wanted to highlight the creator  of this tape, a company named Optica Video."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5320520,5325800,"Considering the name, combined with the addition  of a game that quite literally kills children at the benefit"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5325800,5331323,"of these creatures, I'm led to assume  that Optica Video isn't a kids company at all."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5332330,5338420,"This is a manipulation tape,  with nefarious intent.  And it also drives home the point that the Woodcrawlers'"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5338420,5343610,"food source is drying up.  With this notion in mind, let's think back"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5343610,5349100,to Moonlight Acres.  We established that it was ostensibly ground zero  for the Iris.
8X1xYpPmKvA,5349100,5355480,"The very first location in which humanity  experienced the effects of it.  Given what we know from ""Lethal Omen"""
8X1xYpPmKvA,5355480,5362370,"about the Light's In The Sky event cancellation  and the disappearance  of Jordan Barnes, we can speculate  that perhaps Moonlight Acres"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5362370,5368084,"is or was closed during the time this tape was made.  The Woodcrawlers are hungry, leaving them"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5368084,5375180,"with no choice but to expand  to the neighboring forest to inhabit  and feast on animals, which, as we learned"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5375180,5381645,"from the camp admins note, also began to dwindle in numbers.  It's here where we realize that they're scraping"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5381645,5387460,"for anything they can get,  and this is further evident by the shot  of the Woodcrawler devouring the police car"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5387460,5394380,at the video's end.  Whoever is behind Optica Video  isn't someone inherently good.
8X1xYpPmKvA,5394380,5399510,"They're helping them, leading us, for the very first time,  to question the morality"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5399510,5407175,"of Gemini Home Entertainment as a company.  With Regnad, Harbinge,  and Gyneva, there was, at the very least,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5407175,5414047,"ambiguity in their ethics.  But here, that's not the case at all."

8X1xYpPmKvA,5466670,5473593,"The video begins by introducing us to a new,  revolutionary piece of mining technology  called the Remote-Operated Compact Tunneler."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5474540,5481180,"As the name implies, it provides the user  with tunneling capabilities,  while mitigating all risk that would otherwise be involved."

8X1xYpPmKvA,5513150,5519900,"of the various technologies present  within the ROCT, like an optical zoom lens  to focus on important details,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5519900,5527560,"a compact microphone to detect running water  or nests, and even an altimeter  with a heads-up-display so you're always conscious of where,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5527560,5530233,and what the ROCT is tunneling into.

8X1xYpPmKvA,5574500,5581773,"(eerie ambient music)  Following this, we then learn of the heavily protected,  industrial-grade battery aboard the ROCT."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5582855,5588653,"And, it seems like we're gonna need it considering  it's been spotted by something."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5591632,5596750,(eerie ambient music)  We then cut back to the ROCT's camera at a depth
8X1xYpPmKvA,5596750,5598413,of 145 meters.

8X1xYpPmKvA,5702130,5708210,"So here, we observed the ROCT tunnel into what appears  to be a Woodcrawler nest which are later referred"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5708210,5713730,"to as Gardens.  The deeper we go, the more infested things become,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5713730,5719290,"which, combined with the phrase,  ""mutation of the heart"", leads me to believe  that these creatures are infecting"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5719290,5725429,"and mutating Earth somehow from the inside out.  The purpose of the red flesh is currently unclear,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5725430,5732630,however we can postulate that it's some kind  of artery for the Woodcrawlers crops.  Whether those crops are the Woodcrawlers
8X1xYpPmKvA,5732630,5738100,"offspring, Nature's Mockery,  or something else entirely is also undetermined,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5738100,5742613,however we know that something  is being propagated beneath the ground floor.

8X1xYpPmKvA,5776919,5784450,(soft music)  Video 12 is an educational film  brought to us by the Warner Area Department of Health.
8X1xYpPmKvA,5785360,5789423,"In this one, we're going to learn about  a condition known as Deep Root Disease."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5790490,5797930,"The video's split up into five sections.  Roots, Contraction, Bulbs, Diagnosis,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5797930,5803430,"and Sprouts.  In the roots section, we observe an obscure illustration"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5803430,5809570,"of some sort of growth.  We're told that Roots begin to form from the underside  of something called Bulbs,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5809570,5816857,"and as growth progresses, its speed accelerates.  Furthermore, its base swells as growth continues,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5816857,5823921,resulting in the surrounding area becoming discolored.  (soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,5846760,5853000,"With this newfound context, we learn that this disease  is biologic, driving home the point"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5853000,5859710,"that this first illustration is taking place  underneath the skin's surface.  We learn that it progresses rapidly,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5859710,5867503,"and after making contact  with bones, is able to spread freely.  What exactly its effects are, is still unclear."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5869596,5872013,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,5878370,5881373,"Moving on, we learn how to contract DRD."

8X1xYpPmKvA,5960580,5966570,"Straight off the bat,  we can make the connection between Deep Root Disease  and the spot on the camp administrator's neck."
8X1xYpPmKvA,5966570,5972120,"And given what we know from ""Lethal Omen""  and the player character's transformation  in the suicide ending,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,5972120,5974420,I'm definitely seeing some correlation here.
8X1xYpPmKvA,5977478,5979895,(soft music)

8X1xYpPmKvA,6038600,6044013,"A somatic condition that, given the ending,  appears to spread via direct contact."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6045140,6051719,This video is pivotal  because it breaks down a prior assumption  about how these human transformations actually work.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6051720,6058450,"We initially assumed that Woodcrawlers  inhabiting victims bodies were  the only way they created fake people,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6058450,6064960,"however in this video, we learn  of something entirely different that ultimately  results in formation of new bones,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6064960,6070190,and shifting tendons.  It goes without saying that this alludes to a human
8X1xYpPmKvA,6070190,6076793,"to Woodcrawler transformation.  The process seems to start slow,  but rapidly takes off the longer you have it."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6077700,6084523,"With this in mind, I wanted to back up  to the Camp Information Video  and highlight this section about the former Camp Staff."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6085360,6090700,"As we can recall, they were labeled as vessels.  When we first got to this point,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6090700,6096580,"we were unsure if this was a reference to Fake People  or something else,  however I'm really beginning to think"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6096580,6103313,"that these two terms are synonymous.  With Deep Root Disease,  it is something entirely different,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6104220,6109543,"it's a sickness, a plague, spread by direct contact  with someone infected."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6110560,6115710,"It's this affliction that ultimately  results in your untimely transformation into a Woodcrawler,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6115710,6120900,"leading you to becoming one with them,  and gaining a primal desire to hunt, inhabit a vessel,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6120900,6125943,and spread DRD  to the next unsuspecting family so they can become one too.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6127610,6132860,"So, in short, Fake People are gutted  and inhabited by Woodcrawlers,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6132860,6137233,"and due to this notion, they likely don't suffer the effects  of Deep Root Disease."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6138100,6144923,"On the other hand, Deep Root Disease infects humans,  creating new bones, and turning you into them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6146720,6148663,"A cycle of life, per se."

8X1xYpPmKvA,6185600,6193430,"Following this, they take us through  their major advancements through four sections,  computer processing, predictive advancement,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6193430,6201570,"failure avoidance, and ACL communication.  In the first, we learn that Regnad graphical capabilities"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6201570,6208609,"have drastically increased, resulting in the ability  to create 3D models, like we've seen in ""Lethal Omen."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,6208609,6213630,"In the second, we learn  of a breakthrough  in their Predictive Advancement technology, which,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6213630,6220540,"given the name, seems to give insight into future events.  Here, Regnad claims that its capabilities"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6220540,6224703,will soon allow their PCs to surpass every competitor  within the next year.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6226630,6231840,"In section three, they tout their successful avoidance  of technological failures."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6231840,6236940,"They credit this breakthrough to the so-called support  and wisdom from their client,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6236940,6244300,"but who this client is, is currently unclear.  And lastly, in the final section, they inform us"

8X1xYpPmKvA,6252420,6255143,That recording is as follows.

8X1xYpPmKvA,6401933,6405924,Jack.  Jack.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6408713,6409546,Jack.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6416028,6416945,Jack is us.

8X1xYpPmKvA,6461482,6467650,"(ominous music)  - [Narrator] For the past three minutes,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6467650,6474620,"we observed the AI tech in action.  Given that, this time, we have a grander,  outside perspective on how things work,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6474620,6480940,"it allows us to formulate some key points.  For one, we can see that the Regnad computers"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6480940,6488210,"are becoming infected with the sprouts we saw in  Deep Root Disease, hinting at the possibility  that this mutation can spread through some medium"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6488210,6495260,"of analog transmission.  Two, we realize they're on iteration 1,417,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6495260,6502119,"meaning that they've nailed down communication to an art.  Three, we understand that the ACL module"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6502120,6507225,"feeds the client a prompt,  transmitting it through various antennae on the outside  of the building."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6507225,6514280,"And four, the client, which is presumably of Iris origin,  is responding, effectively opening a line"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6514280,6519300,"of communication between humanity and these creatures.  Now, at the end"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6519300,6525070,"of the video, we observed Regnad's eagerness  to meet their client,  meaning that they're well aware that they're communicating"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6525070,6531074,"with something.  This is not an artificial intelligence,  and these stories bear stark references"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6531074,6539150,"to what we've seen from Gemini so far.  In Iteration 1,417, we can observe that the prompt is Earth,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6539150,6545920,"with the response given reading,  ""Mary sees the gateway die.  Sleeping ones are eaten whole."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6545920,6549427,"The vessel floats into the maw.  The jaw unhinges."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,6551490,6558100,"Now this could reference one of two things.  Either we can take it literally,  assuming that Woodcrawlers eat people,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6558100,6563486,"like the vessels we saw in the Camp Information Video,  or we can take this symbolically."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6563486,6569020,"The line ""Mary sees the gateway die""  seems to allude back to Saturn and its rings."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6569020,6575896,"Given that they seemed thinner than usual  in the Our Solar System video, combined  with the fact that it was referenced as the gateway,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6575896,6581793,"perhaps Saturn is in the way,  of sorts, unknowingly suppressing the Iris' influence  on Earth."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6583200,6589473,"It's withering away,  and at the very same time, the threat  of the Iris is ever growing back home."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6590420,6596450,"It wants to mutate, to consume everything,  and this vessel we all live on is inching closer"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6596450,6598053,and closer to it's demise.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6602010,6608400,"The next prompt is Moonlight,  with the response, ""New things roam the feeding grounds."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6608400,6614656,"The harbinger guards in vain.  Mary hears a creaking sound.  The hungry eye is welcomed."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,6616580,6623900,"Admittedly this one is a bit more ambiguous.  Could be referencing fake people  as the new things that are more active at night,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6623900,6629460,"however it's ultimately up for debate.  What is clear, is the term harbinger,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6629460,6634764,which clearly alludes to Harbinge Technologies.  A harbinger is defined as a person
8X1xYpPmKvA,6634765,6643363,"or thing that announces  or signals the approach of another.  In other words, exactly what Harbinge Technologies is doing."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6644940,6649960,"This line drives home the idea that this client is aware  of their existence, and so too"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6649960,6657140,"of the inadequacy of their products.  This explains why the Woodcrawler  was able break in so easily in ""Lethal Omen."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,6657140,6664033,"Their guidelines don't work,  but they're none the wiser  because they probably followed them too, and died."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6665980,6673180,"Lastly, with the references to Jack, we can assume  that he mutated.  When this happened, is still unclear,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6673180,6677650,however we can postulate that it  just might have been when those fake people attacked him.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6681350,6687060,"And so, with the way things are going here,  I don't think Regnad's onto a breakthrough."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6687060,6691823,"Any sane person would pull the plug on this project,  however they're pressing onward."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6695930,6703281,I know this won't be good.  (soft music)

8X1xYpPmKvA,6726870,6731213,"Here, we're placed into a 1985 Christmas Eve Party  at Moonlight Acres."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6734078,6736495,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,6739430,6742963,"Things start ordinarily,  and the party seems lively."

8X1xYpPmKvA,6853795,6856212,(screeching)
8X1xYpPmKvA,6861400,6868910,"And so we get our first look  at a distinctly different creature to a Woodcrawler.  Whatever this is is incredibly large in size,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6868910,6871660,with some sort of tentacles protruding out of its body.
8X1xYpPmKvA,6875779,6879029,(soft Christmas music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,6912714,6918310,"(ominous music)  And like that wasn't enough, we then learn"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6918310,6923983,that this abomination is Mary.  This video is interesting
8X1xYpPmKvA,6923983,6930330,"because it presents a contradiction.  Mary Dean was listed at the beginning as a videographer,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6930330,6934453,"however at the end, she is completely transformed to this."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6935840,6942763,"We know that Deep Root Disease gains speed  after it gets to your bones,  but, damn, I didn't realize it was that fast."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6944050,6951120,"This leads us to assume that Jack  and Mary entered the Christmas party normally.  Mary's affliction was likely at a very late stage,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6951120,6956500,"and she probably figured she could power through it.  With this, the outside shots are potentially filmed"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6956500,6961760,"by her as she stepped outside to get some air,  and, while out there,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6961760,6966810,"that is when her transformation finalized.  I know it sounds like,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,6966810,6971742,"and could very well be a stretch,  but I'm struggling to find an explanation for why this is."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6973560,6980433,"What is certain, though, is that she isn't a Woodcrawler.  She's as foreign to us as Woodcrawlers are to them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,6983270,6985623,And now we see what that mentality feels like.

8X1xYpPmKvA,7020820,7026223,"Ah, Home Invasion Help,  an educational guide by our good friends over  at Optica Video."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7027510,7034610,"The video begins by explaining  how stressful home invasion can be,  and reassures their viewer that this video should ease that."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7034610,7040170,"We're then told of a couple points to be aware of,  like the fact that windows  and doors are the most common entrances"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7040170,7047840,"during a home invasion,  and that locking them can slow a threat.  Following this, it advises to install a security system,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7047840,7056673,"including cameras, motion detectors, and alarms.  All of which can be disabled by blunt force."

8X1xYpPmKvA,7145080,7150480,"It's clear to us that this tape is not for the homeowner,  cementing the fact that Optica Video"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7150480,7157130,"is not a company of good.  Interestingly, we now know the method"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7157130,7165219,"of entry when Woodcrawlers create Fake People.  Incapacitation, followed by entry through the proboscis,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7165220,7171270,"or in other words, the nasal cavity.  Now, quick side note."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7171270,7176010,The reference to the proboscis is interesting  because it's not something inherent to human beings.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7176860,7181930,"Interestingly, we also saw that Woodcrawlers  perceive humans as what appear to be mannequins,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7181930,7187663,and perhaps their interpretation  of a human nose is a proboscis.  I don't know.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7187663,7190300,"It could be a stretch,  but that's what I took from it."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7202920,7208963,"Following this, we're now outside of a home.  This handheld camera footage seems familiar."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7210500,7211750,Let's see what they find.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7339591,7344258,(thudding) (screeching)
8X1xYpPmKvA,7347740,7354239,"It's funny, going back to the beginning  of this video and rereading everything  with this new context, really paints things"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7354240,7359500,"in a different perspective.  This video never referenced homeowners,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7359500,7364580,"it was always ambiguous.  So, throughout this home,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7364580,7371088,"we can observe the red fleshy substance  we saw all over the Garden.  Furthermore, we can notice that same material sculpted"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7371088,7375143,"into the shape of humans,  with one of them clearly being alive."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7377360,7383910,This is Deep Root Disease in its most critical form.  This family's house is clearly infested
8X1xYpPmKvA,7383910,7389608,"with Woodcrawlers,  and likely has been for a while.  Alongside this, the disease was possibly"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7389608,7394860,"all over their house  without them knowing it,  and after contracting it  and having it run its course,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7394860,7402030,"we now see what exactly it does to you.  Furthermore, as we can recall from Monthly Progress Report,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7402030,7408573,"these Deep Root sprouts are able to grow,  anywhere, giving us a visual cue  and warning of places to avoid."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7409700,7417120,"We can also notice how these people can't move.  Much like the plagued NPC at the end  of ""Lethal Omen"", they're frozen,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7417120,7421833,likely in their final moments  of infection before their transformation takes place.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7423040,7428673,"You're left in a vegetative state, unable to move.  Unable to feel."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7429540,7430563,Unable to speak.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7434980,7440141,"But there's a catch here.  A few videos ago, we postulated that Woodcrawlers"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7440142,7446770,"do two things.  Spread DRD, and inhabit the victims bodies,  which we now know is through their interpretation"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7446770,7451929,of a human nose.  We never really entertained the idea  of Woodcrawlers inhabiting the bodies
8X1xYpPmKvA,7451930,7458480,"of people already infected,  which is what I believe is happening here.  Their skin is gone,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7458480,7463483,and we're witnessing what otherwise  would be taking place inside  of their body if they were fully intact.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7464570,7471929,"With this in mind, these people  are now likely coexisting, one version  of them are fake people out in the wild somewhere,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7471930,7478550,"but the real version,  their infected insides, well, that's what you're lookin' at."

8X1xYpPmKvA,7513638,7519230,"(soft music)  And so, we make our way to the 16th"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7519230,7525970,"and final video of Gemini Home Entertainment.  Brought to us by Gyneva, a ship named Crusader 5"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7525970,7530870,"has returned from a decades long mission  after photographing Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune."

8X1xYpPmKvA,7661120,7666320,"So unsurprisingly, Crusader 5 has encountered the Iris  and its many moons."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7666320,7672193,"And all of them, appear to be fleshy, deformed,  and alive."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7673880,7680280,"Interestingly, we also observe two moons  being fused together by an organic force,  cementing the fact that the Iris'"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7680280,7683833,"influence is abundant, affecting more than just planets."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7685610,7688889,"Oh yeah, and Neptune's f-cking missing."

8X1xYpPmKvA,7833451,7839699,"(ominous music)  Alright, so this final video was also a lot to unpack,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7839700,7844824,"but I'm gonna do my best to line it out.  So here, we observed the inside"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7844825,7850660,"of the Iris, something that is, unsurprisingly full  of every cornerstone of a sentient being."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7850660,7855967,"With arteries, muscular fibers,  and even what appear to egg sacs."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7855967,7861992,"Before we get into what we saw at the end, though,  let's back up and establish  what exactly this Crusader mission is."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7863090,7870400,"As we could see, it began in June of 1982.  If the Moonlight Acres mythology is anything to go off of,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7870400,7877599,"then we know that the Iris arrived  in the Solar System decades earlier.  With this in mind, we can infer that this mission"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7877600,7884039,"was reactionary.  It's likely that astronomers noticed something happening  with Neptune, with strange anomalies"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7884040,7890790,"and movement not physically possible.  And so, they launch the Crusader  to venture out, take photographs"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7890790,7894863,"of only Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune,  and report back with their findings."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7896850,7902434,"As we saw, the first stop was Jupiter.  Here, everything was normal."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7902434,7906550,"The moons were there, Jupiter was there,  and everything checked out."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7907870,7913570,"Upon moving to Saturn, the planet seemed okay.  Crusader 5 then photographs three"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7913570,7920930,"of its moons, Titan, Iapetus, and Chiron.  Interestingly, Chiron doesn't actually exist,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7920930,7926767,"but the Crusader was still able to get a shot of it.  It gets even weirder during this brief cut,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7926767,7931093,in which we can read that the Crusader  actually only photographed two of them.
8X1xYpPmKvA,7932820,7939170,"Anyway, moving on, we then make our way to Neptune.  This segment only spans two months,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7939170,7944450,"and that's because Neptune is gone.  During its hunt for this missing planet,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7944450,7950115,"it comes into contact with various moons  of Jupiter, Uranus, and Saturn that are all completely out"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7950115,7955270,"of place and out of orbit.  And following this, it then encounters the source"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7955270,7961173,"of the problem,  the Iris."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7963457,7970270,"It's here where it's sucked inside,  and begins to photograph its interior.  We then make our way through the esophagus"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7970270,7974643,"and the spine, before approaching  what the video calls it's conscious mind."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7975810,7981340,"While inside, we then observe numerous scenes on Earth,  including a DRD infected person standing"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7981340,7988113,"over a bed in early May,  and either a transmission module  or structure from Regnad Computing in late October."
8X1xYpPmKvA,7989090,7997050,"It's here where I'm led to believe  that we're witnessing things through the lens  of the Iris.  Somehow, the Crusader was able to link into its mind,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,7997050,8003740,"observing the visual input that its been processing.  And finally, at the very end,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8003740,8011323,"we lose signal.  The Crusader goes offline for seven months,  and from here, we assume that it was then ejected somehow,"

8X1xYpPmKvA,8017340,8020003,or it's still inside the Iris.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8023461,8027517,And the Iris is the one making it way to us.

8X1xYpPmKvA,8036054,8038804,(dramatic music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8041270,8049130,"And there we have it.  16 videos, chock full of disturbing lore, hidden secrets,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8049130,8055310,"and tons of names, companies, planets,  creatures, you name it.  There is so much going on"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8055310,8060960,"within Gemini Home Entertainment, and the beauty  of it is that it's given to us  with such ambiguity."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8060960,8066573,"So much of this story is left up to interpretation,  and for all I know, you could very easily"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8066574,8073320,"have a different theory from mine  on the events taking place.  Tying this all together is going to be a monster,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8073320,8079683,"so if I were you, I'd grab a Monster,  because we're about to go full theory mode  to piece together all of this."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8081250,8088023,"And so, ladies and gentlemen,  to me, Gemini Home Entertainment  goes a little somethin' like this."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8095764,8101750,"(dramatic music)  Sometime within the millennium,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8101750,8107403,"a planet that we now know  as the Iris enters our solar system,  nesting its place between Neptune and Pluto."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8109210,8114972,It was looking for life.  Any sort of home to invade and colonize.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8116000,8123563,"Initially, Neptune was a contender  which is likely why it chose this spot,  however, it then discovered something else."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8126530,8130003,The perfect target.  The perfect home.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8132060,8138090,"The Iris begins to study, to learn how humans work  and interact simply because it can."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8138090,8145320,"It's far smarter  and more powerful than anything humans  have ever experienced,  and could easily take over in an instant,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8145320,8149512,"but it wont do that, at least, not yet."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8150620,8156190,"It mutates Neptune through some sort  of means that is unclear,  and this transformation finalizes sometime"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8156190,8162446,"in the early 1930s.  It's here where it began to emit solar storms to Earth,  and with this, Jupiter"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8162446,8167790,"and Saturn were affected by proximity.  Within this first solar storm,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8167790,8173702,"there were likely trace amounts  of Woodcrawler, Nature's Mockery,  and Deep Root Disease embryos, seeds,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8173702,8178969,"and antigens respectively,  and it's possible that, upon reaching Earth,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8178970,8185589,it took years for these to grow into a life stage  that is invasive.  (ominous music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8191440,8196033,"Deep within a Minnesota forest, Woodcrawlers make contact  with Earth."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8197860,8205620,"Beneath the ground,  they begin nesting, hollowing out the depths  of the Earths' crust  and building what we come to learn as their Garden."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8205620,8211010,"It's unclear how deep this Garden goes,  however given the phrase ""mutation of the heart"","
8X1xYpPmKvA,8211010,8217019,"we can assume that they're burrowing as far  as the Earth's core.  On the surface, effects"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8217019,8224058,"of this mutation are felt in larger  and larger quantities over time,  and by the mid 1930's, people have begun to go missing,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8224058,8232090,"an unknown plant begins to multiply,  and a strange, slow-moving disease  begins spreading throughout the surrounding communities."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8232090,8237993,"People also begin acting erratic  and unnatural, however humanity is clueless  on how to handle it."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8239740,8245950,"Word began to spread by the late 1930s  as campgoers began reporting sightings  of Skinwalkers, that we now know"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8245950,8252000,"were most likely Woodcrawlers taking the bodies  of various animals.  Given their repulsion to sunlight,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8252000,8257152,"we know they were only seen  and heard at night, thus meaning that people  never got a good look at them."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8258630,8264399,"As the Iris becomes more influential,  the Light's in the Sky event becomes more common,  attracting more campgoers,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8264400,8270690,"and resulting in more victims.  Strange men began to show up as well,  and with this, some sort"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8270690,8277919,"of ambiguous deal was made with the camp,  and they left without ever returning.  (knocking on door)"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8278881,8284750,"(eerie ambient music)  As these creatures and this foreign plague spreads,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8284750,8289533,"various companies begin studying  and creating VHS tapes, all with a unique goal."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8290710,8296399,"Harbinge forms after the Iris' threat  becomes known, and they begin  to create guides while engineering devices"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8296399,8301670,"that they believe will help humanity survive it.  Regnad, a highly-competitive"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8301670,8307280,"computer company obsessed  with becoming a leader in technological advancement,  becomes fascinated by the Iris"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8307280,8312606,"and begins manufacturing technology that can interact  with it, thus resulting in the rapid progress"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8312606,8319551,"of their titular AI.  Gyneva, a group likely composed  of scientists encounters anomalies deep"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8319551,8325530,"within the ocean floor,  and decides to share their discovery,  later landing them a space exploration deal"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8325530,8332361,"in which they help launch a spacecraft called Crusader 5.  Optica Video, an otherwise family friendly company,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8332362,8339802,"at, some point, is taken over,  resulting in their videos becoming  manipulation tapes in favor of the Iris."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8339802,8346840,"And caught between everything, is Gemini Home Entertainment,  a company that aims to document the mutation"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8346840,8352929,of Earth for archival purposes.  They seem to be a neutral party  and this is likely why they accept
8X1xYpPmKvA,8352929,8356652,"all media about the Iris, no matter the affiliation."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8362141,8369859,"(eerie ambient music)  As the decades pass, the mutation  of humanity becomes ever abundant."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8369860,8376483,"People disappear in growing numbers, and Canadian  and US Governments likely become involved  in studying the events transpiring."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8377568,8383590,"Resultingly, Moonlight Acres was shut down  from the '40s through the '80s,  and during its closure,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8383590,8388850,"various engineering feats materialize, like the ROCT,  and the Crusader 5,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8388850,8397643,"both of which were created to study the Iris's influence.  And by 1982, the Crusader 5 mission begins."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8399922,8406803,"(eerie ambient music)  In June, it approaches Jupiter."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8407700,8414150,"Nothing is found,  and everything checked out.  Three years later, it approaches Saturn,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8414150,8419470,studying it from December  of 1985 to January of 1986.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8419470,8425003,"Things, too, seem ordinary,  until the Crusader finds a moon that shouldn't be there."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8426750,8433420,"Concurrently back home,  Moonlight Acres reopens its doors in 1985,  advertising burrow free cabins,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8433420,8438890,"and new measures in place to prevent Woodcrawler influence.  During that same year,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8438890,8445830,"they throw their first Christmas Eve Party in celebration  of reopening and a new outlook,  however this party abruptly ends"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8445830,8450323,due to Mary's transformation into an anomalous beast  that has not yet been studied.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8451460,8458197,"Consequently, the partygoers are either killed or flee,  and among the latter, is Jack who makes his way"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8458198,8463370,"to the campground bunker we saw in ""Lethal Omen.""  It's here when he waits things out"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8463370,8470363,"while his mutated wife leaves,  and thereafter, he develops a newfound goal  in life to spread the word about these creatures."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8471870,8477280,"Back in space throughout the next few years,  Neptune goes missing  because of its mutation."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8477280,8484400,"It, Jupiters, and Uranus' moons begin to suffer mutation  all of which are caught by Crusader 5."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8484400,8489283,"And soon after, in 1992, it gets devoured  by the source of the problem."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8491020,8496470,"It's safe to assume that, by this point back on Earth,  Jack Dean had filmed his World's Weirdest Animals"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8496470,8502880,"and Wilderness Survival Guide videos, however contrary  to our prior assumption about him being killed at the end"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8502880,8508110,"of the former, we realize that he actually survived this,  due to the Iris' vision"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8508110,8514964,of a man in a bed in early May of 1993.  The same time we know that Jack Dean had gone missing.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8516180,8522050,We assume that this DRD infected person likely spread it  to him given their inability to move from standing
8X1xYpPmKvA,8522050,8528430,"by his bed.  It's here where he potentially entered the SIV  to check if he contracted it, given that we learned"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8528430,8536683,"that DRD infected people are unable to dream.  And with the existence  of his dream, we learn that he did not."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8538210,8544100,"Resultingly, he ventures back out to film some more.  He was given a new lease on life,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8544100,8551420,"and decides to explore a house that he suspects is infected.  As we established, the flesh people we saw"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8551420,8557920,"were likely their infected insides,  with their actual bodies being elsewhere,  but something I failed to mention earlier"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8557920,8563112,"was what happened during that ending.  The Woodcrawler that attacked him, likely resulting"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8563112,8568323,"in either his death,  or his untimely transformation into a Woodcrawler."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8570944,8575777,(clattering) (screeching)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8580420,8586980,And this is only the story of Jack and Mary.  Take this and multiply it by the population
8X1xYpPmKvA,8586980,8592783,"of Minnesota, the United States, the World  and we realize the monumental scale  of the problem."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8593870,8597902,Gemini Home Entertainment is  but a small lens to what we can see.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8598980,8605630,Now imagine what we can't.  The claim that the SIV dreams did not predict the future
8X1xYpPmKvA,8605630,8609729,"was a lie.  They were stockpiled in ""Lethal Omen"" for a reason."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8611050,8614540,And that was because they predicted what the fall  of humanity would look like.

8X1xYpPmKvA,8643365,8651030,"(eerie ambient music)  So, as fate would have it, something happened"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8651030,8657580,"while I was chest deep in making this video.  Part of an entirely new playlist called the Library,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8657580,8660293,"we have a new video, titled Wretched Hands."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8665180,8671070,"It appears to be an internal company tape,  completely separate from Gemini, made by the staff  of Moonlight Acres."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8682712,8690320,(soft music)  The opening shot takes place on Christmas Eve.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8690320,8696760,"Given that it was denoted as taking place 25 minutes  before the first attack, we can assume that this scene"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8696760,8700894,is happening concurrent to the Christmas Eve Party episode  we saw a few videos back.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8702534,8704951,(soft music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8722226,8725393,(eerie ambient music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8728071,8737369,"Moving on, we then observe these letters by a Glenn Arthur.  In the first, written on May 3, 1946, Glenn explains"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8737370,8743622,to someone named Curtis that he's found a way  to uphold their end of the deal  with these giving into these creatures  abhorrent demands.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8748450,8754300,"- [Glenn] Curtis, come down to the camp this weekend.  Fulton and I have devised a plan on how"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8754300,8758543,we can continue to uphold the deal  without giving into these being' abhorrent demands.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8759620,8764800,Richards has seen a bear lurking near the boys' cabins.  We'll go out and shoot it.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8764800,8771490,"If the Statue wants a sacrifice,  it'll have to settle for this.  I will be a pawn no longer."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8771490,8777900,"Curtis, I tell you this with complete certainty.  If I could do it over again,  I would never have made that deal."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8779381,8782881,Glenn.  (choir singing)
8X1xYpPmKvA,8793520,8796797,"- [Narrator] In the second letter, we get another reference  to ""Lethal Omen."""
8X1xYpPmKvA,8799110,8805365,"- [Glenn] Wretched hands tap my window,  A strangers' fangs scrape the walls."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8892820,8898430,"- [Narrator] Alright, so this ritual, this ""deal"",  that the camp staff made is now becoming clear,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8898430,8906399,"giving us more context on the decades-long closure  of Moonlight Acres.  For starters, this ""Glenn Arthur"" person is implied"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8906400,8913241,"to have had some sort  of affiliation with the camp during its  original run, and we can assume  that he was authoritative enough to make a decision"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8913241,8919400,"as big as a deal  with the strange men from the 1930s.  I'm led to believe that this ""deal"""
8X1xYpPmKvA,8919400,8924143,involved the Statue requiring annual sacrifices  in exchange for sparing their lives.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8924990,8931500,"Initially, Glenn went along with it,  fearing that if he didn't,  he would meet the fate  of the others who began to go missing"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8931500,8938760,"during the same time period.  By the year 1946, nearly a decade later, though,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8938760,8945240,"he decided that he couldn't do it anymore.  It was too much for him,  and so he explains to Curtis that he has an idea"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8945240,8953570,to mitigate the burden  of having to live his life at the expense of others.  That idea is a bear.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8953570,8958273,He's going to offer a bear in lieu  of another human being in hopes that the Statue accepts it.
8X1xYpPmKvA,8959310,8966579,"But, of course it doesn't.  Regardless, the bear undergoes the same ritual process"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8966580,8972482,"as humans would, however with it, its transformation results  in a mutated abomination."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8973490,8979683,"Initially, it still resembled a bear,  however with it came a newfound hunger that was insatiable."
8X1xYpPmKvA,8981030,8988460,"At this point its unclear  if the Statue purposefully implemented this method  of absorption into this bear as some sort of retaliation,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8988460,8993500,"or if it's some sort of poetic coincidence.  What we do know, though,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,8993500,9001479,"is that people are still being sacrificed  and molded into something otherworldly.  It's just that, this time, they're becoming utilized"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9001480,9004493,as limbs for this monster that won't stop growing.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9006550,9012640,"So, as it turns out, Moonlight Acres did not shut down  because of government intervention."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9012640,9019213,"There was a monster on the loose,  and, given that Christmas Eve Party,  nearly everyone was killed."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9029227,9035740,"(dramatic music)  Alright, for real this time, I swear to God,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9035740,9043620,"we're at the finish line.  We're done, we're here.  During this journey, we have unpacked Woodcrawlers,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9043620,9049460,"the Bear, Fake People, The Iris, A disturbing campground,  weird mannequin figures, the death"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9049460,9055040,"of a couple, the motivations behind various companies,  alien communication, planet mutation,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9055040,9061337,"inevitable societal collapse, infectious diseases,  dream recordings, strange ritual sacrifices,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9061337,9065894,and this bizarre unawareness by the general public  as to what's actually going on.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9067080,9072240,I cannot wait to see more episodes  of this so we can get answers for things still shrouded
8X1xYpPmKvA,9072240,9078120,"in mystery.  There was a lot left to interpretation,  and I'm keen to hear your input about it."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9079370,9085569,"For instance, what did the mutation  of Neptune actually entail?  How in the world did people get the bright idea"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9085570,9091970,to reopen Moonlight Acres?  Who's creating the Optica VHS tapes?  What was the dynamic between camp staff
8X1xYpPmKvA,9091970,9098030,"and the ritual statue in ""Lethal Omen?""  And what exactly does the mutation of Earth encompass?"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9098030,9104343,"We know that it's happening,  and we get visuals of it,  however the endgame is still shrouded in mystery."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9106120,9111823,"What we do know, though, is that within the world  of Gemini Home Entertainment, humanity's days are numbered."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9113150,9118990,Woodcrawlers and the mutated Bear are hunting.  Nature's Mockery is consuming.  And on the brink
8X1xYpPmKvA,9118990,9122533,"of collapse, society is hanging by nothing but a thread."
8X1xYpPmKvA,9124240,9131053,The Iris is with us now.  Laughing at us.  And we know it's not going anywhere.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9132033,9134783,(dramatic music)
8X1xYpPmKvA,9141320,9147680,"What began, appearing to be a simple invasion story  about creatures taking over humanity,  had blossomed into an incredibly"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9147680,9154400,"dense alternate history chock full of hidden bits  of lore to uncover, interactive elements,  and ambiguity surrounding a company"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9154400,9159854,that we're still unable to fully understand.  I absolutely recommend that you watch this series
8X1xYpPmKvA,9159854,9166980,from start to finish  and formulate your own theories  on what you think Gemini Home Entertainment entails.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9166980,9173990,"As we've seen, there are tons of secrets,  and you just might spot something  that could change your entire outlook"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9173990,9179439,"on this series altogether.  Remy Abode has crafted something incredibly special,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9179440,9185140,"and the beauty of it is that it's been confirmed  to be ongoing.  I dunno about you,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9185140,9191970,but I know for a fact that I'll be here  for that ride every step of the way.  This is not the end of the road.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9191970,9196634,"There are still tons of points left unanswered,  and much like The Walten Files,"
8X1xYpPmKvA,9197550,9201402,we now lie in wait until our next venture begins.
8X1xYpPmKvA,9205320,9210859,"In the meantime, I'm going on vacation.  I'll see you all at Moonlight Acres."
