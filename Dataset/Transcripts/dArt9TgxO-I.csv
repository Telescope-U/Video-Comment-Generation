dArt9TgxO-I,0,5040,Before we unbox the Redmi Note 11 Pro+ there are some things I wanna tell you
dArt9TgxO-I,7040,13040,Note 11 series is the most popular series in the world
dArt9TgxO-I,14040,19040,"But as we're moving forward, there's some confusion growing with it as well"
dArt9TgxO-I,21040,26040,"When before they launched the Max,now they've launched the Pro+"
dArt9TgxO-I,28040,33040,"I don't know why they've changed the name,and because of the changing names"
dArt9TgxO-I,34040,37040,"There's a lot of confusion as well, in Note 11 series there's Note T, Note S."
dArt9TgxO-I,43040,48040,"They change the processor in one,and some specifications in other and launch a new phone"
dArt9TgxO-I,64040,68040,They've already released the specifications which are great
dArt9TgxO-I,70040,80040,Generally Note phones are very good which you can use for 3-4 years
dArt9TgxO-I,82040,86040,In this video we will find out if it's the perfect mid-range phone for consumers
dArt9TgxO-I,87040,91040,But before that make sure to subscribe to the channel
dArt9TgxO-I,95040,100040,"The box is not flat which means it will have some contents in it, which we don't get to see these days"
dArt9TgxO-I,116040,123040,"The charger is 67W,and the charging cable is USB Type A to Type C"
dArt9TgxO-I,136040,144040,"There's a question for you,which phone had a glass back that was launched at Rs 10K"
dArt9TgxO-I,145040,149040,"This has a glass back as well,some might like the design,some won't"
dArt9TgxO-I,150040,157040,"The sides are flat,feels good in hand. It's a bit big"
dArt9TgxO-I,162040,167040,"The case is really good, they were not that great earlier"
dArt9TgxO-I,180040,184040,"There's a USB Type C, speaker grill,a microphone and sim card at the bottom"
dArt9TgxO-I,185040,192040,"At the top there's, 3.5MM jack, IR blaster, noise-canceling microphone"
dArt9TgxO-I,193040,196040,The fingerprint sensor is side-mounted
dArt9TgxO-I,213040,217040,"It has a 6.67"" FHD+AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate"
dArt9TgxO-I,220040,227040,"So you'll love the display, you'll also the multimedia as it has stereo speakers with good quality"
dArt9TgxO-I,233040,237040,"But if you're watching a YouTube video,you cannot watch it in 4K"
dArt9TgxO-I,246040,248040,And even on Netflix the HDR content is unavailable
dArt9TgxO-I,261040,267040,"Today's video format is different, I'll be answering some of your questions"
dArt9TgxO-I,268040,273040, And I'll be answering those. One of the question was whether it supports 4K recording
dArt9TgxO-I,274040,277040,The limitation was because of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 processor
dArt9TgxO-I,300040,304040,The Pro variant had a quad-camera setup which had a depth sensor
dArt9TgxO-I,308040,319040,"The haptic feedback is good,and it has a side-mounted fingerprint"
dArt9TgxO-I,323040,331040,"The processor supports 7 bands,and this is first Pro phone which is 5G"
dArt9TgxO-I,336040,341040,I don't why we're facing problems with score because this time as well the score was low
dArt9TgxO-I,345040,354040,"The 695 gives a score around 4lkhs,but this had very low score"
dArt9TgxO-I,355040,359040,"But it does not affect the performance,it is smooth undoubtedly"
dArt9TgxO-I,362040,367040,Even the gaming experience at very High settings is smooth
dArt9TgxO-I,373040,381040,"One of the question was if we could play BGMI@90, which is not available You get a constant fps of 41."
dArt9TgxO-I,388040,394040,One question was if the 11 Pro is an upgrade of the 10 Pro because 10 Pro
dArt9TgxO-I,395040,404040,"Had 732G processor,if we're talking about the GPU then it's an upgrade"
dArt9TgxO-I,407040,411040,But it's a downgrade if it comes to battery efficiency.
dArt9TgxO-I,420040,425040,Someone asked which was value for money between Mi 11i and 11 Pro Plus
dArt9TgxO-I,426040,433040,The top variant costs around Rs 25K. And so does the Mi 11i
dArt9TgxO-I,438040,443040,But the performance of the Mi 11i is definitely better than this
dArt9TgxO-I,444040,454040,You get 4K recording. And rest of the specifications are the same
dArt9TgxO-I,455040,459040,But I'd say Mi 11i is better in performance than Note 11 Pro+
dArt9TgxO-I,460040,470040,Is it worth upgrading from redmi Note 10 Pro Max? I don't think you should
dArt9TgxO-I,479040,486040,"It does not Andriod 12 out of the box, and there have been 3-4 months since MIUI 13"
dArt9TgxO-I,487040,495040," Came on Andriod 12, so i think if you're launching a Pro Plus variant we need every specification there is"
dArt9TgxO-I,501040,510040,"Talking about the price, its base variant costs more than Rs 20K, and the prices of other"
dArt9TgxO-I,511040,515040,Brand phones Which are competing with this phone are also increasing
dArt9TgxO-I,523039,530040,And because of inflation and increasing taxes we can’t expect low prices
dArt9TgxO-I,535040,544040,But if I’m comparing it with price to performance ratio basic things like 4K recording Is missing
dArt9TgxO-I,547040,553040,But with offers the price goes down under Rs 20K
dArt9TgxO-I,558040,565040,"Today's unboxing format was a bit different, we wanted to answer your most asked questions"
dArt9TgxO-I,576040,581040,If you loved this video format leave a like and ask your questions that we can cover in #AskArun
dArt9TgxO-I,582040,585040,That's all for this video until the next one Keep Trakin & Stay Safe
