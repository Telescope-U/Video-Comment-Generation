Y53hOrNU1u0,11599,13679,um egypt's slogan should be leave your
Y53hOrNU1u0,13679,15679,camera at home but bring your money they
Y53hOrNU1u0,15679,17119,don't want you to shoot here that's very
Y53hOrNU1u0,17119,20480,obvious very clear
Y53hOrNU1u0,22080,24240,egypt it's one of the worst countries in
Y53hOrNU1u0,24240,26320,the world for filmmakers i wouldn't
Y53hOrNU1u0,26320,28960,suggest it for tourists either
Y53hOrNU1u0,28960,31359,within hours of arriving in cairo my
Y53hOrNU1u0,31359,33040,team and i were interrogated and
Y53hOrNU1u0,33040,34880,searched
Y53hOrNU1u0,34880,36719,finally all of our equipment was
Y53hOrNU1u0,36719,38719,confiscated it's very dehumanizing at
Y53hOrNU1u0,38719,40000,this point because they're going through
Y53hOrNU1u0,40000,42160,my personal items picking stuff up or
Y53hOrNU1u0,42160,43520,telling me to pick stuff up and then
Y53hOrNU1u0,43520,44879,saying what is this
Y53hOrNU1u0,44879,46559,it's a back roller
Y53hOrNU1u0,46559,48960,why do you need this why do i need this
Y53hOrNU1u0,48960,51360,how about go [ __ ] so all this for the
Y53hOrNU1u0,51360,53600,crime of wanting to film ford in egypt
Y53hOrNU1u0,53600,56960,with a valid shooting permit
Y53hOrNU1u0,56960,59520,now with only iphones in hand the show
Y53hOrNU1u0,59520,61520,must go on we're gonna go into the back
Y53hOrNU1u0,61520,63600,and see what few people have seen before
Y53hOrNU1u0,63600,66080,let's go
Y53hOrNU1u0,66479,68159,we're hitting the streets of cairo in
Y53hOrNU1u0,68159,70000,search of any food vendors who will have
Y53hOrNU1u0,70000,71520,us this is where the action really
Y53hOrNU1u0,71520,73600,happens so many raw ingredients is
Y53hOrNU1u0,73600,75600,beautiful but even this low profile
Y53hOrNU1u0,75600,77439,shooting won't be enough to evade this
Y53hOrNU1u0,77439,79600,country's overzealous militaristic
Y53hOrNU1u0,79600,82400,police force right now the van is at a
Y53hOrNU1u0,82400,84240,police station they've gone through the
Y53hOrNU1u0,84240,87200,shots on my phone
Y53hOrNU1u0,87200,88240,we don't know what's going to happen
Y53hOrNU1u0,88240,90000,next it's possible they'll try to delete
Y53hOrNU1u0,90000,92479,the footage
Y53hOrNU1u0,94159,96159,so what did i film that was so egregious
Y53hOrNU1u0,96159,98560,the police demanded i delete it i'll
Y53hOrNU1u0,98560,102479,show you right after breakfast
Y53hOrNU1u0,107280,108960,as the first rays of light pierced
Y53hOrNU1u0,108960,110799,through the trees and old dust cape
Y53hOrNU1u0,110799,112880,buildings of cairo a small window of
Y53hOrNU1u0,112880,115520,peace gradually fades away replaced by
Y53hOrNU1u0,115520,119280,the hustle and bustle of city life
Y53hOrNU1u0,126799,129599,cars motorbikes bicycles and the
Y53hOrNU1u0,129599,131680,occasional horse or donkey populate the
Y53hOrNU1u0,131680,133599,streets
Y53hOrNU1u0,133599,135920,crowds are massive and move like schools
Y53hOrNU1u0,135920,138000,of fish with a beautiful chaos like no
Y53hOrNU1u0,138000,139580,place i've seen before
Y53hOrNU1u0,139580,140800,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,140800,143599,let me be clear i like this city it has
Y53hOrNU1u0,143599,146400,character on camera it looks amazing
Y53hOrNU1u0,146400,148800,however i don't like and i don't respect
Y53hOrNU1u0,148800,151840,the people who run it
Y53hOrNU1u0,153280,155680,day one location one
Y53hOrNU1u0,155680,157760,our conniving and mostly useless local
Y53hOrNU1u0,157760,160400,producer has brought us here
Y53hOrNU1u0,160400,162720,a small street-side eatery on a quiet
Y53hOrNU1u0,162720,165360,road low traffic means a lower chance of
Y53hOrNU1u0,165360,167280,suspicious police or quickly forming
Y53hOrNU1u0,167280,172720,mobs sounds great but what's on the menu
Y53hOrNU1u0,173320,176239,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,176239,177680,we are in the kitchen of our first
Y53hOrNU1u0,177680,179440,location and i'm excited because i don't
Y53hOrNU1u0,179440,180640,know what people in egypt eat for
Y53hOrNU1u0,180640,182000,breakfast but right now i'm getting a
Y53hOrNU1u0,182000,184000,little bit of a hint behind me he is

Y53hOrNU1u0,185519,187840,falafel too the falafel here is made
Y53hOrNU1u0,187840,189920,with fava beets and then fried until

Y53hOrNU1u0,191680,193360,now i'm going to go to the serving area
Y53hOrNU1u0,193360,195200,where they have so much food and i'm
Y53hOrNU1u0,195200,196480,going to decide what we're going to eat
Y53hOrNU1u0,196480,198959,officially for breakfast today let's go
Y53hOrNU1u0,198959,201599,this is saad alharabi a restaurant named
Y53hOrNU1u0,201599,204000,after its owner mr assad specializes in
Y53hOrNU1u0,204000,206480,dishes that use fava beans fava beans
Y53hOrNU1u0,206480,208319,are a common breakfast here in cairo

Y53hOrNU1u0,220480,222239,and tons of flavor combinations so
Y53hOrNU1u0,222239,223920,people come they step up they order and
Y53hOrNU1u0,223920,225680,then he's kind of the main guy making it
Y53hOrNU1u0,225680,227200,happen someone just ordered a chip
Y53hOrNU1u0,227200,228640,sandwich
Y53hOrNU1u0,228640,230159,another chip sandwich i should get one

Y53hOrNU1u0,240799,242480,sandwich he's got the soft bread here
Y53hOrNU1u0,242480,244159,puts in the chips some salt and then
Y53hOrNU1u0,244159,246640,this is a white sauce i'm not sure what
Y53hOrNU1u0,246640,248720,that is yet he puts in some salad some
Y53hOrNU1u0,248720,250319,greens carrots a little bit of cabbage
Y53hOrNU1u0,250319,251439,in there

Y53hOrNU1u0,260239,262750,promise i'll pay
Y53hOrNU1u0,262750,264400,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,264400,265680,crunchy
Y53hOrNU1u0,265680,267199,there's something delectable about
Y53hOrNU1u0,267199,269040,putting a soft carbohydrate with a
Y53hOrNU1u0,269040,270400,crunchy chips i don't know if you guys
Y53hOrNU1u0,270400,272000,were poor like me but when i grew up i
Y53hOrNU1u0,272000,273520,would just make a potato chip sandwich
Y53hOrNU1u0,273520,275199,with ketchup or with butter and so it
Y53hOrNU1u0,275199,277040,takes me back to those days to the days
Y53hOrNU1u0,277040,279040,of my impoverished youth
Y53hOrNU1u0,279040,280639,most of flavor is coming from the salt
Y53hOrNU1u0,280639,282560,he added and the tahini tahini is kind
Y53hOrNU1u0,282560,283600,of new for me i don't know if i've had
Y53hOrNU1u0,283600,285600,that before tahini it's an arabic
Y53hOrNU1u0,285600,287680,condiment made from toasted ground whole
Y53hOrNU1u0,287680,290160,sesame seeds made into a paste here
Y53hOrNU1u0,290160,292240,you'll see it join most meals the tahini
Y53hOrNU1u0,292240,294080,it's saltine a bit of sweet sourness i
Y53hOrNU1u0,294080,295360,don't know i need to try that more to
Y53hOrNU1u0,295360,296960,kind of pin it down the bread is
Y53hOrNU1u0,296960,298720,excellent it's soft it's chewy it's a
Y53hOrNU1u0,298720,300240,great little treat before you eat your
Y53hOrNU1u0,300240,301680,actual breakfast which we're gonna do
Y53hOrNU1u0,301680,303919,next
Y53hOrNU1u0,303919,305440,aside from chip sandwiches they have
Y53hOrNU1u0,305440,307280,something called food the food is
Y53hOrNU1u0,307280,308960,something that is eaten commonly for
Y53hOrNU1u0,308960,310320,breakfast here all throughout the city
Y53hOrNU1u0,310320,313170,of cairo and what it is it's fava beans
Y53hOrNU1u0,313170,314639,[Applause]
Y53hOrNU1u0,314639,316160,fava beans are one of the oldest
Y53hOrNU1u0,316160,318000,cultivated plants with evidence of their
Y53hOrNU1u0,318000,320400,incorporation into egyptian diets dating
Y53hOrNU1u0,320400,323600,back to at least 6000 bc now in day
Y53hOrNU1u0,323600,325840,they're a staple in egypt used in dishes
Y53hOrNU1u0,325840,329199,like fool and falafel
Y53hOrNU1u0,329280,331919,a soupy dish made with stewed fava beans
Y53hOrNU1u0,331919,334240,salt and pepper corn oil tahini and
Y53hOrNU1u0,334240,335919,chili sauce it kind of looks like
Y53hOrNU1u0,335919,337919,refried beans in a way but it probably
Y53hOrNU1u0,337919,339360,tastes different because it has spices
Y53hOrNU1u0,339360,341520,in there too falafel a bean cake made
Y53hOrNU1u0,341520,344479,with fava beans spices garlic and herbs
Y53hOrNU1u0,344479,347120,roll it into balls and deep fry this is
Y53hOrNU1u0,347120,348960,a kind of a typical egyptian breakfast
Y53hOrNU1u0,348960,350320,something you might expect to see in the
Y53hOrNU1u0,350320,354160,morning here in cairo and it's beautiful
Y53hOrNU1u0,354400,356000,there's a huge selection people probably
Y53hOrNU1u0,356000,357840,wouldn't order as many things but i have
Y53hOrNU1u0,357840,359440,let's take a look at these
Y53hOrNU1u0,359440,361280,i mentioned french fries for breakfast i
Y53hOrNU1u0,361280,362720,can't say that this is rare i'm looking
Y53hOrNU1u0,362720,364479,around i see almost everybody here has
Y53hOrNU1u0,364479,366720,ordered the french fries
Y53hOrNU1u0,366720,368319,here this is falafel i'm going to break
Y53hOrNU1u0,368319,370400,that open oh very nice looking extra
Y53hOrNU1u0,370400,372240,crispy fried and delicious as far as i
Y53hOrNU1u0,372240,373280,know it's something to be eaten with
Y53hOrNU1u0,373280,374400,anything i'm just going to try plain
Y53hOrNU1u0,374400,377520,like this let's go for it
Y53hOrNU1u0,378240,379840,super crunchy and pretty airy too
Y53hOrNU1u0,379840,381199,falafel's not always my favorite
Y53hOrNU1u0,381199,383280,sometimes i find falafel can be really
Y53hOrNU1u0,383280,385039,dry but here this is one of my top pull
Y53hOrNU1u0,385039,386240,off ones i've ever had i think because
Y53hOrNU1u0,386240,387759,they're using a different type of bean
Y53hOrNU1u0,387759,389919,it's much more airy and light and it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,389919,392639,not just like a thick big chunk of fried
Y53hOrNU1u0,392639,395039,stuff the main reason i came here is for
Y53hOrNU1u0,395039,397039,this this is called fool and this is a
Y53hOrNU1u0,397039,398720,very common breakfast that you'll see in
Y53hOrNU1u0,398720,400080,cairo you can't really eat it with your
Y53hOrNU1u0,400080,401759,hands it's not really a spoon provided
Y53hOrNU1u0,401759,403360,you kind of laugh it up with the bread
Y53hOrNU1u0,403360,405280,right here this bread is super famous
Y53hOrNU1u0,405280,407919,here in cairo it's called egyptian bread
Y53hOrNU1u0,407919,409599,and i want to go right now to see how
Y53hOrNU1u0,409599,413840,it's made and then we get teleported
Y53hOrNU1u0,417199,419520,behind me now an egyptian bread bakery
Y53hOrNU1u0,419520,421039,you can see from the front the fresh
Y53hOrNU1u0,421039,422800,bread coming out people buying it over
Y53hOrNU1u0,422800,424720,here but we're gonna go into the back
Y53hOrNU1u0,424720,426800,and see what few people have seen before
Y53hOrNU1u0,426800,427300,let's go
Y53hOrNU1u0,427300,429280,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,429280,431599,here it's a very tight fit it's enough
Y53hOrNU1u0,431599,433599,space for the ingredients and the oven
Y53hOrNU1u0,433599,435840,that's basically all that's here
Y53hOrNU1u0,435840,437919,in the back room you can see they're
Y53hOrNU1u0,437919,439520,making the flour they're making the
Y53hOrNU1u0,439520,441840,dough
Y53hOrNU1u0,441919,444000,made with a simple recipe this is the
Y53hOrNU1u0,444000,446479,backbone of egyptian cuisine
Y53hOrNU1u0,446479,449840,hearty thick gluten rich round and flat
Y53hOrNU1u0,449840,451840,it's consumed with almost all egyptian
Y53hOrNU1u0,451840,454240,meals eaten fresh daily street side
Y53hOrNU1u0,454240,456160,bakeries like this are found on every
Y53hOrNU1u0,456160,458720,block with delivery men nimbly balancing
Y53hOrNU1u0,458720,462030,racks of fresh bread on their heads
Y53hOrNU1u0,462030,464560,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,464560,466240,way in the back room tucked away from
Y53hOrNU1u0,466240,467919,the daylight you see where the process
Y53hOrNU1u0,467919,470000,begins he's already made the dough and
Y53hOrNU1u0,470000,471840,then he portions it into these perfect
Y53hOrNU1u0,471840,473680,little balls and it goes on top of this
Y53hOrNU1u0,473680,476000,powder this powder is like a wheat flour
Y53hOrNU1u0,476000,477919,that's been baked its only purpose is to
Y53hOrNU1u0,477919,480479,make the dough not stick to the sheet
Y53hOrNU1u0,480479,483680,and look at how he moves
Y53hOrNU1u0,484879,486319,each of these big old pieces of wood
Y53hOrNU1u0,486319,488720,gets about 15 to 20 on there now this is
Y53hOrNU1u0,488720,490960,going to hang out here in this room for
Y53hOrNU1u0,490960,493120,about 20 minutes to an hour during that
Y53hOrNU1u0,493120,495280,time it's gonna flatten out naturally
Y53hOrNU1u0,495280,496800,and then it's gonna be ready to go into
Y53hOrNU1u0,496800,498800,the oven that's the next step but here i
Y53hOrNU1u0,498800,500560,just wanna appreciate the skill i mean
Y53hOrNU1u0,500560,502000,look at this it's like an optical
Y53hOrNU1u0,502000,504160,illusion how is he doing it
Y53hOrNU1u0,504160,506800,nice thank you boom
Y53hOrNU1u0,506800,507610,boom
Y53hOrNU1u0,507610,510000,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,510000,512560,we are now at the roasting station so
Y53hOrNU1u0,512560,513680,this is where it's going to go from
Y53hOrNU1u0,513680,516560,dough to something beautiful
Y53hOrNU1u0,516560,518800,he's gently peeling it off of this dust
Y53hOrNU1u0,518800,520399,it's like a wheat dust that everything
Y53hOrNU1u0,520399,522240,rests on and the way he flips it in his
Y53hOrNU1u0,522240,524480,hand it kind of helps expand the dough
Y53hOrNU1u0,524480,526560,and then that gets plopped onto here
Y53hOrNU1u0,526560,528880,this is a conveyor belt it's super hot
Y53hOrNU1u0,528880,530560,hundreds of degrees you can hear the
Y53hOrNU1u0,530560,534640,fire underneath heating it up
Y53hOrNU1u0,534640,536560,so they bake hundreds of these at a time
Y53hOrNU1u0,536560,538160,load them up on the conveyor belt and
Y53hOrNU1u0,538160,540320,that just moves and moves continuously

Y53hOrNU1u0,561519,563200,bread put it on their head and they'll
Y53hOrNU1u0,563200,564959,even ride a bike while carrying the
Y53hOrNU1u0,564959,566320,bread and delivering it to different
Y53hOrNU1u0,566320,567839,restaurants or different families

Y53hOrNU1u0,574160,576720,of steam it's hot it's toasty on the top
Y53hOrNU1u0,576720,578160,you can see the different textures the
Y53hOrNU1u0,578160,580240,bottom texture has been affected by
Y53hOrNU1u0,580240,582480,sitting in that wheat dust it's a bit
Y53hOrNU1u0,582480,584240,rough and coarse and then on this side
Y53hOrNU1u0,584240,585600,of course you can see how it's been
Y53hOrNU1u0,585600,587200,toasted by the flame
Y53hOrNU1u0,587200,590959,that is beautiful and it's so hot
Y53hOrNU1u0,590959,592959,oh it's so delicious it's warm it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,592959,594880,stretchy it's soft it's a little bit
Y53hOrNU1u0,594880,597120,toasty since it's so fresh
Y53hOrNU1u0,597120,599360,this bread plays a huge part in egyptian
Y53hOrNU1u0,599360,601200,life not only incorporating
Y53hOrNU1u0,601200,603120,calorie-dense carbohydrates into the
Y53hOrNU1u0,603120,605360,local diet for thousands of years but it
Y53hOrNU1u0,605360,607760,can also be used as a utensil pick up
Y53hOrNU1u0,607760,610079,food scoop up some sauce or wrap it
Y53hOrNU1u0,610079,612000,around anything you like
Y53hOrNU1u0,612000,613920,so that's how you make egyptian bread
Y53hOrNU1u0,613920,615279,so i'm going to break off a piece i'm
Y53hOrNU1u0,615279,616640,going to dip it in the food i want to
Y53hOrNU1u0,616640,619839,really mix the contents mainly that bean
Y53hOrNU1u0,619839,621360,but there's other flavor enhancers in
Y53hOrNU1u0,621360,622880,here too there's chili powder tons of
Y53hOrNU1u0,622880,625839,tahini try it out
Y53hOrNU1u0,626959,628240,it's got a lot of flavor i mean it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,628240,629680,really starchy from the bean that's the
Y53hOrNU1u0,629680,631440,main thing i noticed the tahini is very
Y53hOrNU1u0,631440,633040,unique because it almost acts like a
Y53hOrNU1u0,633040,634480,yogurt the way it's mixed with different
Y53hOrNU1u0,634480,636079,dishes but it's not dairy at all it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,636079,637680,crushed sesame seeds that have been
Y53hOrNU1u0,637680,640399,cured down into this thick sauce
Y53hOrNU1u0,640399,642240,i'm feeling it not super bold flavors
Y53hOrNU1u0,642240,644160,but it's hearty it's savory and it kind
Y53hOrNU1u0,644160,645600,of gives you a lot of energy for
Y53hOrNU1u0,645600,647200,starting your day the last thing i want
Y53hOrNU1u0,647200,649040,to try is this right here so this is the
Y53hOrNU1u0,649040,651279,one called mish mish is a traditional
Y53hOrNU1u0,651279,653440,and pungent egyptian dish made by
Y53hOrNU1u0,653440,655440,fermenting salty cheese for several
Y53hOrNU1u0,655440,657760,months or even years that is intense
Y53hOrNU1u0,657760,659839,super salty kind of pungent and then the
Y53hOrNU1u0,659839,661680,tomatoes offer some relief because it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,661680,663760,just so powerful it almost has a
Y53hOrNU1u0,663760,665519,fermented quality to it but i like it it
Y53hOrNU1u0,665519,667120,seems like a good food to mix and match
Y53hOrNU1u0,667120,668240,with everything else you're getting some
Y53hOrNU1u0,668240,670079,new flavors and then you can move back
Y53hOrNU1u0,670079,671680,over to the pool so this is it a
Y53hOrNU1u0,671680,673279,beautiful way to start your day a ton of
Y53hOrNU1u0,673279,675120,foods here and actually all of this for

Y53hOrNU1u0,807519,808959,spaghetti and kind of like a cut up
Y53hOrNU1u0,808959,810720,elbow noodle then there's some meat and
Y53hOrNU1u0,810720,812800,right here this is my favorite part the

Y53hOrNU1u0,825920,827600,it's a great show and all the people
Y53hOrNU1u0,827600,829279,they're looking up at us here they can't
Y53hOrNU1u0,829279,830959,see all the onions being chopped on the
Y53hOrNU1u0,830959,832639,floor after the onions it gets the
Y53hOrNU1u0,832639,834480,tomatoes it gets the chickpeas but

Y53hOrNU1u0,841040,843440,now
Y53hOrNU1u0,843440,844800,all right all right everything's
Y53hOrNU1u0,844800,846240,separated right now on the sauce they

Y53hOrNU1u0,847360,849920,vinegar something spicy oh yes squeeze
Y53hOrNU1u0,849920,851839,of lime or lemon and then they put that
Y53hOrNU1u0,851839,854160,on top of the feast right here that
Y53hOrNU1u0,854160,857839,looks incredible look at this
Y53hOrNU1u0,857920,859360,i'm now an expert but when you come to
Y53hOrNU1u0,859360,861279,places like this you have to look around
Y53hOrNU1u0,861279,862560,and see what other people are doing and
Y53hOrNU1u0,862560,864240,i see that no one just eats it from the
Y53hOrNU1u0,864240,866000,top to bottom they mix it all up and
Y53hOrNU1u0,866000,867360,they get it all layered so all the
Y53hOrNU1u0,867360,868800,flavors are in each bite i'm gonna grab
Y53hOrNU1u0,868800,871380,a big spoonful that looks beautiful
Y53hOrNU1u0,871380,873920,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,873920,876079,wow it's like a spaghetti so it's like a
Y53hOrNU1u0,876079,877600,spaghetti but then you have the fried
Y53hOrNU1u0,877600,878800,onions which adds an interesting
Y53hOrNU1u0,878800,880480,dimension of savoriness and then you've
Y53hOrNU1u0,880480,882160,got chickpeas in there they're almost
Y53hOrNU1u0,882160,883760,soggy but it adds a very different
Y53hOrNU1u0,883760,885600,texture to everything
Y53hOrNU1u0,885600,886959,there is some meat on here but it's not
Y53hOrNU1u0,886959,888480,super easy to taste amongst everything
Y53hOrNU1u0,888480,889920,else a lot of this series is about me
Y53hOrNU1u0,889920,891600,trying to figure out what egyptian food
Y53hOrNU1u0,891600,893040,even is because it's something i've
Y53hOrNU1u0,893040,894800,never experienced before now i'm in the
Y53hOrNU1u0,894800,896959,heart of the country i'm trying really
Y53hOrNU1u0,896959,899199,authentically pure egyptian food can i
Y53hOrNU1u0,899199,900880,put my finger on exactly what egyptian

Y53hOrNU1u0,903600,905980,need to keep eating
Y53hOrNU1u0,905980,907519,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,907519,909760,just after filming kosheri the police
Y53hOrNU1u0,909760,911519,stopped us and made our production van
Y53hOrNU1u0,911519,913760,drive to the nearby police station they
Y53hOrNU1u0,913760,915920,caught us in the sinful act of filming
Y53hOrNU1u0,915920,919199,bread on the sidewalk
Y53hOrNU1u0,920880,923360,right now the van is at a police station
Y53hOrNU1u0,923360,924959,all the local people have been taken out
Y53hOrNU1u0,924959,926240,of the van they've gone through the
Y53hOrNU1u0,926240,928160,shots on my phone
Y53hOrNU1u0,928160,929600,and we don't know what's going to happen
Y53hOrNU1u0,929600,931279,next it's possible they'll try to delete
Y53hOrNU1u0,931279,933440,the footage luckily we've already just
Y53hOrNU1u0,933440,935680,airdropped the footage to a
Y53hOrNU1u0,935680,937759,decoy phone so it doesn't matter but
Y53hOrNU1u0,937759,939680,hopefully it doesn't get to that anyways
Y53hOrNU1u0,939680,941680,but this is what it's like to shoot here
Y53hOrNU1u0,941680,943040,all we were doing is
Y53hOrNU1u0,943040,945279,shooting with phones on the street at a
Y53hOrNU1u0,945279,947600,bakery and that was enough to have our
Y53hOrNU1u0,947600,949040,whole vehicle have to be pulled into
Y53hOrNU1u0,949040,951040,here to speak to the police and to
Y53hOrNU1u0,951040,953440,justify our actions even though we have
Y53hOrNU1u0,953440,955759,a permit to shoot doesn't matter
Y53hOrNU1u0,955759,956639,so
Y53hOrNU1u0,956639,958240,i'm not sure what's gonna happen we're
Y53hOrNU1u0,958240,961880,gonna find out pretty soon
Y53hOrNU1u0,964220,970399,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,970399,972079,so we just got done with the police
Y53hOrNU1u0,972079,974240,we're at our next location now get this
Y53hOrNU1u0,974240,977120,they told us to delete our footage why
Y53hOrNU1u0,977120,979360,no reason do we have a permit yup do we
Y53hOrNU1u0,979360,981120,break a lot no as far as i can
Y53hOrNU1u0,981120,983279,understand it all depends on how the
Y53hOrNU1u0,983279,984800,people at the top are feeling on that
Y53hOrNU1u0,984800,986800,particular day what they told us is that
Y53hOrNU1u0,986800,989440,the footage of the bakery we shot wasn't
Y53hOrNU1u0,989440,991519,beautiful it wasn't pretty enough it
Y53hOrNU1u0,991519,993519,didn't meet their standard they told us
Y53hOrNU1u0,993519,995279,to delete it suddenly these guys are
Y53hOrNU1u0,995279,997600,documentary filmmakers i don't get it so
Y53hOrNU1u0,997600,999440,did we actually delete it absolutely
Y53hOrNU1u0,999440,1001519,none while we were waiting we airdropped
Y53hOrNU1u0,1001519,1003680,all the footage to an extra phone that's
Y53hOrNU1u0,1003680,1005519,the phone i showed them and that's the

Y53hOrNU1u0,1015279,1016880,over our shoulders we're constantly
Y53hOrNU1u0,1016880,1019360,paranoid and uh i don't really like it
Y53hOrNU1u0,1019360,1020880,it's not that fun to be honest but we
Y53hOrNU1u0,1020880,1022880,have a job to do the mission must go on

Y53hOrNU1u0,1028770,1033438,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,1033438,1035199,when it comes to egyptian street food
Y53hOrNU1u0,1035199,1037678,hawashi is a big top contender and when
Y53hOrNU1u0,1037678,1039918,it comes to hawashi well you must come
Y53hOrNU1u0,1039918,1041760,here the perfect place to film street
Y53hOrNU1u0,1041760,1043760,food while being shielded from the view
Y53hOrNU1u0,1043760,1046480,of the police
Y53hOrNU1u0,1046959,1049760,this place is called hawaushi al-rafai
Y53hOrNU1u0,1049760,1051600,they're known for their unique recipes
Y53hOrNU1u0,1051600,1053440,and a wide ranging menu with tons of
Y53hOrNU1u0,1053440,1055679,variations like hiroshi with cheese or
Y53hOrNU1u0,1055679,1058000,other various meats now the question
Y53hOrNU1u0,1058000,1062400,that must be answered what the heck is a
Y53hOrNU1u0,1064840,1067520,hawashi this is one of my favorite foods
Y53hOrNU1u0,1067520,1069440,i've tried so far i'm sorry i tried this
Y53hOrNU1u0,1069440,1071760,one without you guys sometimes i eat on
Y53hOrNU1u0,1071760,1073919,my own time and it's one of my favorites
Y53hOrNU1u0,1073919,1075360,so here's how it starts first of all
Y53hOrNU1u0,1075360,1077120,this is just like the egyptian bread my
Y53hOrNU1u0,1077120,1079120,man here he cuts the edges off so it can
Y53hOrNU1u0,1079120,1081039,be opened up easily then over here
Y53hOrNU1u0,1081039,1082799,they're weighing out some minced lamb
Y53hOrNU1u0,1082799,1084400,meat that lamb meat is spiced it's
Y53hOrNU1u0,1084400,1086400,delicious and it gets spread kind of
Y53hOrNU1u0,1086400,1089760,smeared by hand within this bread disk
Y53hOrNU1u0,1089760,1092080,hawashi is a typical egyptian sandwich
Y53hOrNU1u0,1092080,1093760,what makes this place stand out are the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1093760,1097760,secret spices they put into the meat
Y53hOrNU1u0,1097840,1100080,once a batch of hawashi is stopped they
Y53hOrNU1u0,1100080,1102000,bring him to the grilling station here
Y53hOrNU1u0,1102000,1104320,he puts it on this very hot griddle the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1104320,1105520,meat's gonna cook through the bread
Y53hOrNU1u0,1105520,1107200,didn't get crispy and all of it is going
Y53hOrNU1u0,1107200,1110399,to be absolutely delicious
Y53hOrNU1u0,1112559,1114000,i've had this before but i've never had
Y53hOrNU1u0,1114000,1115840,it with cheese it's steaming up there's
Y53hOrNU1u0,1115840,1117600,spices there's lamb there's cheese it
Y53hOrNU1u0,1117600,1120480,smells incredible
Y53hOrNU1u0,1120880,1122720,let me show you really quick i love this
Y53hOrNU1u0,1122720,1126320,oh yes ooey gooey cheese on the inside
Y53hOrNU1u0,1126320,1128240,oh as he cuts it you can see the cheese
Y53hOrNU1u0,1128240,1131120,squirting out that looks so good aside
Y53hOrNU1u0,1131120,1132320,from this we also have pickled
Y53hOrNU1u0,1132320,1134480,vegetables and we have tatini here now
Y53hOrNU1u0,1134480,1136240,i've tried tahini a couple times today i
Y53hOrNU1u0,1136240,1137360,still don't quite know what it tastes
Y53hOrNU1u0,1137360,1140799,like because i haven't tried it alone
Y53hOrNU1u0,1140880,1142320,interesting to me it's similar to a
Y53hOrNU1u0,1142320,1143520,hummus it's a little bit different
Y53hOrNU1u0,1143520,1144559,feeling in your mouth because it's not
Y53hOrNU1u0,1144559,1145679,made with chickpeas it's made with
Y53hOrNU1u0,1145679,1147840,sesame seeds but with the spice the salt
Y53hOrNU1u0,1147840,1150080,the texture it's a little hummusy i'm
Y53hOrNU1u0,1150080,1150960,gonna try some of these pickled
Y53hOrNU1u0,1150960,1152400,vegetables right here we've got tomato
Y53hOrNU1u0,1152400,1153840,eggplant i'm gonna grab some of the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1153840,1156880,carrot whoa okay pickle overload i think
Y53hOrNU1u0,1156880,1158480,that is the palate cleanser but i need
Y53hOrNU1u0,1158480,1160080,to cleanse my palate from that with the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1160080,1161679,pepsi
Y53hOrNU1u0,1161679,1163360,i've noticed in this country the pickles
Y53hOrNU1u0,1163360,1165919,are on another level they're super salty
Y53hOrNU1u0,1165919,1168080,sour and spicy too it's kind of
Y53hOrNU1u0,1168080,1169520,addictive though it's such a powerful
Y53hOrNU1u0,1169520,1171120,flavor it punches you in the face like
Y53hOrNU1u0,1171120,1173039,eating raw garlic but then after a while
Y53hOrNU1u0,1173039,1174720,it goes away it dissipates and you want
Y53hOrNU1u0,1174720,1176880,another hint this is why we're here oh
Y53hOrNU1u0,1176880,1179360,beautiful cheese pull we'll try it out
Y53hOrNU1u0,1179360,1182559,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,1182559,1183840,there's so many things to love the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1183840,1185679,texture is so crunchy the bread by
Y53hOrNU1u0,1185679,1187280,itself is amazing the meat is
Y53hOrNU1u0,1187280,1188640,beautifully seasoned almost a little bit
Y53hOrNU1u0,1188640,1190080,like eating a seed kebab with all the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1190080,1192160,spices and flavors and just a very fine
Y53hOrNU1u0,1192160,1193760,mince take a look at this here you can
Y53hOrNU1u0,1193760,1196000,see when i peel the top layer off the
Y53hOrNU1u0,1196000,1198160,cheese is still picky not too liquidy
Y53hOrNU1u0,1198160,1200000,not too solid give it a little bit of a
Y53hOrNU1u0,1200000,1201760,dip is this what people do i'm assuming
Y53hOrNU1u0,1201760,1203750,it's there as a dip like ranch
Y53hOrNU1u0,1203750,1204880,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,1204880,1206400,i don't know if i can say it's improving
Y53hOrNU1u0,1206400,1208240,it it is adding a different level
Y53hOrNU1u0,1208240,1209760,different dimension it's like dipping
Y53hOrNU1u0,1209760,1211280,something that's already very delicious
Y53hOrNU1u0,1211280,1212640,and putting it into hummus it doesn't
Y53hOrNU1u0,1212640,1214400,need anything extra it's beautiful just
Y53hOrNU1u0,1214400,1217280,how it is just like your wife girlfriend
Y53hOrNU1u0,1217280,1218799,whoever you're sleeping with i keep
Y53hOrNU1u0,1218799,1220880,telling them that they love that stuff
Y53hOrNU1u0,1220880,1222960,i believe if it's not too late we've got
Y53hOrNU1u0,1222960,1224400,one more spot to go
Y53hOrNU1u0,1224400,1225760,let's do it
Y53hOrNU1u0,1225760,1227520,if the police don't stop us
Y53hOrNU1u0,1227520,1231919,rivers winding round words in my head
Y53hOrNU1u0,1231919,1234919,shivering
Y53hOrNU1u0,1235360,1237360,our first day of shooting in cairo was
Y53hOrNU1u0,1237360,1239600,quite a mixed bag the police took our
Y53hOrNU1u0,1239600,1241600,cameras
Y53hOrNU1u0,1241600,1243440,our local egyptian producer turned out
Y53hOrNU1u0,1243440,1245440,to be completely incompetent and even
Y53hOrNU1u0,1245440,1248960,more police told us to delete our
Y53hOrNU1u0,1254159,1256000,i ate some fantastic food my favorite
Y53hOrNU1u0,1256000,1257280,thing we've tried today
Y53hOrNU1u0,1257280,1258799,and i get to visit one of the seven
Y53hOrNU1u0,1258799,1262919,man-made wonders of the world
Y53hOrNU1u0,1265260,1276559,[Music]
Y53hOrNU1u0,1276559,1278080,we are right outside the pyramids right
Y53hOrNU1u0,1278080,1279120,now we're going to ride the camels
Y53hOrNU1u0,1279120,1280240,because that's what you do when you come
Y53hOrNU1u0,1280240,1282000,here i've been told the first thing i
Y53hOrNU1u0,1282000,1284720,should do is find a camel that speaks to
Y53hOrNU1u0,1284720,1286880,me
Y53hOrNU1u0,1286950,1288480,[Music]

Y53hOrNU1u0,1297520,1300000,this series and my experience in egypt
Y53hOrNU1u0,1300000,1302320,they're both complicated
Y53hOrNU1u0,1302320,1303919,i have nothing against the people of
Y53hOrNU1u0,1303919,1305760,egypt i just think in a country that
Y53hOrNU1u0,1305760,1308240,makes 12 percent of its gdp from tourism
Y53hOrNU1u0,1308240,1310480,the police the authorities and those who
Y53hOrNU1u0,1310480,1312320,run this place might want to stop
Y53hOrNU1u0,1312320,1314320,treating their tourists like spies and
Y53hOrNU1u0,1314320,1317320,criminals
Y53hOrNU1u0,1320320,1322640,next time on day two against my better
