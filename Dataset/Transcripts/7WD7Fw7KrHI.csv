7WD7Fw7KrHI,232720,238400,up and like where you pick up the jump  rope and you drop a little rope maybe  you hit the heavy bag a little bit maybe  you do some curls
7WD7Fw7KrHI,238400,244400,but you don't really have an aim  that's why people like to hire trainers  because the trainer will tell you what
7WD7Fw7KrHI,244400,250720,to do  well you can tell yourself what to do  if you don't have money for a trainer
7WD7Fw7KrHI,250720,256400,you don't even have to have an equipment  you know with body weight squats sit ups  chin ups
7WD7Fw7KrHI,256400,262720,push-ups you could give yourself a  brutal  full body weight workout and you can

7WD7Fw7KrHI,292160,297840,into it and if you're not into it don't  be into it  and i think that insanity and and  greatness
7WD7Fw7KrHI,297840,304400,are next-door neighbors and they borrow  each other's sugar that's  that's my that's what i've always said
7WD7Fw7KrHI,304400,312160,there's there's something about mastery  like true mastery  uh that requires you to shut off
7WD7Fw7KrHI,312160,319199,massive areas of your life there's a lot  of people that are scared of their  ability to do something that's difficult
7WD7Fw7KrHI,319199,325520,i don't know if i could force myself to  be disciplined i don't know if i could  force myself to take that kind of action
7WD7Fw7KrHI,325520,331360,well if you do force yourself to take  that kind of action you don't have that  question anymore  that question i don't know if i can do
7WD7Fw7KrHI,331360,336880,it well you're doing it  so you obviously do it can you do it  tomorrow we did it today or can you do  it tomorrow
7WD7Fw7KrHI,336880,342880,just do it you get so much more benefit  out of a struggle that you choose to  embark in
7WD7Fw7KrHI,342880,348880,versus a struggle that life throws upon  you  get out there and go and do something
7WD7Fw7KrHI,348880,353919,just just  go and then in the middle of doing it  it'll become easy
7WD7Fw7KrHI,353919,359440,even if it's not easy even if it's hard  it's easier than not doing it and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,359440,365199,wishing that you had done it  [Music]

7WD7Fw7KrHI,390560,396160,you want to kill an alligator you kill  it right after eat  because right after it eats it gets

7WD7Fw7KrHI,442880,448479,animal kingdom and i will tell you this  that the lion is king because the lion
7WD7Fw7KrHI,448479,454720,is hungry the elephant is bigger than  the lion  but the sheet is faster than the lion
7WD7Fw7KrHI,454720,462400,but nobody  is more hungry than the lion goes  any athlete actor musician
7WD7Fw7KrHI,462400,469199,philanthropist it doesn't matter you ask  anybody who is a champion  and the difference between them and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,469199,473439,their opponent  is they were more hungry for it
7WD7Fw7KrHI,474240,480080,if there's anything i can pour from my  heart with this moment  my greatest piece of advice is to
7WD7Fw7KrHI,480080,486800,protect  your hunger are you hearing what i'm  saying who you doing this for
7WD7Fw7KrHI,486800,492960,so the days you don't feel like getting  up just think about them  somebody tell me in this room when you  think about your siblings when you think
7WD7Fw7KrHI,492960,499680,about mom your dad and grandma when you  think about your uncle and aunts when  you think about those coaches those  people who've been there for you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,499680,505039,just raise your hand if you say e.t  sleep is better than that  just raise your hand and tell me anybody

7WD7Fw7KrHI,516320,521440,probably don't  maybe i never been through what you've  been through but i've been through my go  through
7WD7Fw7KrHI,521440,526800,and you don't you don't you don't get  here by quitting when you're tired  you get here by quitting when you finish
7WD7Fw7KrHI,526800,531920,when you're done  you don't stop when you tired you stop  when you're done
7WD7Fw7KrHI,531920,537600,you stop when you complete it when you  execute it  execution is worship and so i execute
7WD7Fw7KrHI,537600,542800,for my mom  i execute for my grandma i execute for  my sister i execute for those kids in
7WD7Fw7KrHI,542800,548560,the hood  who looking for a role model that's why  i wear the hat with a phd that's why i  wear the james
7WD7Fw7KrHI,548560,555040,so when the kids in the hood look at me  they say if e.t can do it i can do it  that's why i can't quit and give up even
7WD7Fw7KrHI,555040,560560,though i get tired just like everybody  else  why because this is what i do this is my  leg
7WD7Fw7KrHI,560560,566240,this is your lane you gotta murder it so  when i ask you you got energy don't play  with me
7WD7Fw7KrHI,566240,572720,when i tell when i say again you got  that energy for the next hundred days  i need to feel your soul in this room
7WD7Fw7KrHI,572720,578080,all right i can  come on i can come on i can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,578080,585040,i will i must come on i can  i will i must give yourself some energy
7WD7Fw7KrHI,585040,591440,come on  i don't care if you gotta listen to me a  thousand times i need you to get crystal
7WD7Fw7KrHI,591440,599760,clear  about your future because the only  reason why you are  here the only reason why you're alive
7WD7Fw7KrHI,599760,606959,is because you have work to do and you  got to figure out why on earth  are you here what is your destiny
7WD7Fw7KrHI,606959,614640,what is the dream that god has given you  you got to have like a shark mentality  because  if a shark swims backward it dies
7WD7Fw7KrHI,614640,622640,a shark can only move forward and so i  need you every single day you  wake up to smell blood and go
7WD7Fw7KrHI,622640,629440,after that dream when you are hungry  you are creative when you are hungry
7WD7Fw7KrHI,629440,636800,you are innovative when you are hungry  when you are no longer  full when you are no longer satisfied
7WD7Fw7KrHI,636800,643360,with where you are and you raise your  standards  it is only then that you can have
7WD7Fw7KrHI,643360,648880,your future if you can stay hungry  you can get the resources if you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,648880,654160,stay hungry you can get the strategy if  you can stay hungry  the idea is going to come if you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,654160,659200,stay hungry the connections will be  aligned if you can stay hungry
7WD7Fw7KrHI,659200,665839,the problem with many of you is that you  got fool  you got complacent you got lazy
7WD7Fw7KrHI,665839,672480,somewhere along the line you lost  your enthusiasm your optimism
7WD7Fw7KrHI,672480,679200,he lost your hunger  i'm never full i'm never full i'm never
7WD7Fw7KrHI,679200,684880,full  i'm never full you got to get hungry  hungry hungry
7WD7Fw7KrHI,684880,689920,hungry eliminate all distractions  eliminate all distractions
7WD7Fw7KrHI,689920,695360,so you got to have a goal you got to  have a dream  you got to get hungry and then you got
7WD7Fw7KrHI,695360,702000,to get real discipline  because motivation will get you going a
7WD7Fw7KrHI,702000,709279,speech will get you fired up but  discipline  is going to give you the power to stay
7WD7Fw7KrHI,709279,716000,committed to whatever that goal is  i'm gonna tell you this right now some  praise can be poison
7WD7Fw7KrHI,716000,721839,it keeps you locked in a state of  paralysis and you shining trophies from  the past
7WD7Fw7KrHI,721839,728480,and that's why you always hear those  people from the past like yeah remember  back in the  day when i used to do this remember back
7WD7Fw7KrHI,728480,734079,in the day they're still  shining the trophy of the past  accomplishments so sometimes we can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,734079,741279,we can receive praise like a venomous  snake  that injects its poisonous venom
7WD7Fw7KrHI,741279,748000,in our veins and in our heart and we get  forward  we get real full you got to be hungry
7WD7Fw7KrHI,748000,753360,for your dream  you got to be hungry for your next level  you got to be hungry for connection and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,753360,761279,alignment  you have to be hungry to fulfill your  destiny hunger  is not an idea hunger is not a mood
7WD7Fw7KrHI,761279,767360,hunger is a lifestyle i'm never fool  this is me every day all day i'm hungry
7WD7Fw7KrHI,767360,774560,to learn  you got to be hungry to read you have to  be hungry to grow  you have to be hungry to manifest what
7WD7Fw7KrHI,774560,780959,is in your head  just say i can come on come on i can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,780959,786880,i can come on one time yup i will  yo i
7WD7Fw7KrHI,789920,796240,don't abort your mission out of  frustration  when you are in the midst of a
7WD7Fw7KrHI,796240,801920,challenging situation  your mind will tell you that you are
7WD7Fw7KrHI,801920,808399,finished your mind will tell you  that you may as well cut your losses now
7WD7Fw7KrHI,808399,815279,your mind will tell you that you are  stuck  and will probably be where you are right
7WD7Fw7KrHI,815279,819519,now  for a long time
7WD7Fw7KrHI,822480,828959,but your thoughts cannot be trusted  when your emotions are high
7WD7Fw7KrHI,828959,837519,your thoughts cannot be trusted  when you have just experienced rejection
7WD7Fw7KrHI,837519,846560,being rejected does not mean that you  are not smart enough  or talented enough rejection is a part
7WD7Fw7KrHI,846560,853120,of  your journey to success  as buckminster fuller said there's
7WD7Fw7KrHI,853120,858800,nothing in a caterpillar  that tells you that it's going to be a  butterfly and welcome to the human
7WD7Fw7KrHI,858800,864639,condition  that's the truth of what it's like to be  a person  you're hoping that you turn inward and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,864639,870079,see some sign some glimmer  some gift that you have that's been  bestowed upon you that you were born
7WD7Fw7KrHI,870079,876720,with that  is your very birthright but there's  nothing  you were born hopelessly average and the
7WD7Fw7KrHI,876720,882959,sooner that you accept that the sooner  that you accept that you were no better  than anyone that came before you  and everyone that's going to come after
7WD7Fw7KrHI,882959,889120,you but all of us  have potential and so the question  becomes the question you have to answer
7WD7Fw7KrHI,889120,894639,with your very life the question  that your actions will answer
7WD7Fw7KrHI,894639,901199,what are you going to do with that  potential will you actuate it will you  bust your ass to get good will you get
7WD7Fw7KrHI,901199,908160,so  good over time that you can play with  the greats will you get  so good that people look at you with awe
7WD7Fw7KrHI,908160,914240,can you get so good that you become the  excuse  that other people use not to try can you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,914240,922079,get so  good that people have to dismiss you as  naturally talented can you get  so good that people refuse to believe
7WD7Fw7KrHI,922079,928639,that they can get that good can you work  so hard gaining a set of skills and  driving yourself day after day to get
7WD7Fw7KrHI,928639,935199,better  never accepting who you are always  pushing yourself forward always  demanding more  and seeing the beauty and what you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,935199,940560,become and knowing that even today  as a caterpillar with nothing
7WD7Fw7KrHI,940560,946959,with nothing to indicate that you'll  become a butterfly can you become  the butterfly through sheer force of
7WD7Fw7KrHI,946959,952880,will  because if you can become that you  become a beacon of hope not for other
7WD7Fw7KrHI,952880,959440,people for yourself because you proved  that there really are no limits  and as walt disney said you may not
7WD7Fw7KrHI,959440,965759,realize it when it happens but a kick in  the teeth  may be the best thing in the world for  you why
7WD7Fw7KrHI,965759,972959,because it's the thing that's going to  make you react it's the thing that's  going to hold you down it's the thing  that is going to make you say
7WD7Fw7KrHI,972959,978959,never again no more i refuse to accept  this about myself i refuse to accept
7WD7Fw7KrHI,978959,985440,that i'm average  i refuse to accept that i can't be  something more i refuse  to stop when something kicks me in the
7WD7Fw7KrHI,985440,991680,teeth i refuse to stop when people hate  on me or tell me that i can't do  something  i refuse to be dictated to by anyone
7WD7Fw7KrHI,991680,996720,even my own potential i refuse  to be held back by anything least of all
7WD7Fw7KrHI,996720,1003040,me  and when you get that in your head when  you know that you can transcend even  yourself that negative voice in your
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1003040,1009920,head  that even getting kicked even failing  getting knocked down  and being covered in blood mud dirt
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1009920,1016079,everything  that would try to stop you that you'll  rise up  and that you'll keep pushing and that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1016079,1022480,you'll define what you're going to  become  when you have that in your mind
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1022480,1028798,then you become unstoppable then you are  the caterpillar that becomes the  butterfly but you have to be willing to  take the knocks you have to be willing
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1028798,1034798,to make the sacrifices  you have to be willing to suffer
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1035280,1041918,and when you're willing to suffer you  can become  anything because it's in that process
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1041918,1048319,of breaking and mending and growing and  shaping that you realize that you are  both the sculptor
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1048319,1055360,and the marble and therein lies the pain  of  creation but in that you can create
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1055360,1062720,yourself  to be anything you want  so the question isn't can you do it
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1062720,1067840,it's only are you willing to do it
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1069039,1075360,the reason people change is because of  pain  the reason we grow is because we get
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1075360,1081520,uncomfortable and we embrace being  uncomfortable  but being honest with the pain that we
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1081520,1088320,feel  is usually the prime mover for people to  do the work that is necessary
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1088320,1094400,to push to the edge embrace the pain  that you're gonna feel when you're  trying to do something great
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1094400,1101039,you have to understand you have to know  that with  greatness comes pain
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1101039,1106960,stop listening to the opinions of others  around us that are saying oh you're  never gonna make it it's impossible
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1106960,1112720,you can't do it you will never make it  acknowledging our suffering being in
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1112720,1118080,touch with the pain  that's enough to say i can't do this i  don't want to do this anymore
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1118080,1123440,like this is not the person i want to  become like i used to sit there
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1123440,1129440,and look at my class my teachers i'm  like i'm going to show you  i'm going to show all of you you think i
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1129440,1134960,suck  i'm going to be the biggest best person  on earth
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1135280,1141600,you need to immerse yourself in school  you need to go  in deep all you doing every single day
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1141600,1147039,is studying  you're going to get distracted from your  goals and all these things
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1147039,1153840,arrows are going to come at you all the  time whatever your goal is  you have to get there even though people
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1153840,1159919,are going to say you can't do it even  though people are going to throw  different opportunities you know you  know i'm sure your friends went out a
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1159919,1164960,million times the happy hour when you  just stayed late find out what it is you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1164960,1173360,want  and go after it as if your life depends  on it  why because it does
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1173360,1180400,thoughts become things whatever you put  out into the universe  you are going to get back you have an
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1180400,1187360,opportunity to still be achieving  so get up and get on it because the week
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1187360,1193840,will struggle  success is reserved for those that are  the strongest
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1194799,1200799,oftentimes people confuse discipline  with focus  and this is what why that's important
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1200799,1208000,there are things  that some people can excel  at because they're focused on them and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1208000,1214640,because they're drawn to it and they  have an incredible passion for it  versus like you tell a guy like hey you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1214640,1221200,know you're going to study to be an  electrical engineer it's like i don't  want to be  an electrical engineer well you got to  have discipline and so they don't have
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1221200,1227360,the drive  and they don't they don't get excited  about it and they don't do but  if you tell that guy whatever you're
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1227360,1233760,going to be a golfer  and he loves golf and he's practicing  every day  and he becomes a professional golfer you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1233760,1239600,say well i thought that guy didn't have  any discipline  well it's not that he didn't have any  discipline he's just not interested in
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1239600,1246320,that other thing  i was never a disciplined kid but i was  i would find things that i loved and i
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1246320,1252159,was obsessed  and i always felt embarrassed by it  because people would say oh your son  like to my mom
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1252159,1257200,your son is so disciplined and she's  like my son's been crazy  like he's not disciplined he finds these
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1257200,1262559,things and that's all he does  all day long like it's not really  discipline because he doesn't clean his
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1262559,1268400,room  he's he's lazy there's all sorts  of he's supposed to do  i never did my homework there's all that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1268400,1275039,but if i had a thing that i was into  i was obsessed about it but i would it  would bother me that i didn't really
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1275039,1281520,have discipline  like if i had jobs that i had to do i  didn't do a good job with them like the  construction jobs that i had
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1281520,1287919,but when it came to those things though  how did you find those things do you  stumble upon lucky  just got luck martial arts i just got
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1287919,1295039,lucky and it clicked with me  like almost immediately i became  obsessed  you know and i wanted to be i wanted to
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1295039,1299520,excel at it and so i was just doing it  all day long
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1300720,1306400,and i think the more you choose to  embark on these struggles  these especially physical and mental
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1306400,1312640,struggles because  i consider both martial arts yoga and  actually even  trail running i consider the mental
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1312640,1319039,struggles as much as physical struggles  because i could stop anytime i want i'm  halfway up the hill i can go this
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1319039,1324720,i'm walking the rest away yeah call my  dog over put him on the leash i'm like  we're walking buddy
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1324720,1331440,but or you could say no this is what i'm  doing today i have a  i have a very clear plan in front of me
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1331440,1337440,my plan is  we're doing four miles today this is  where we start  this is where we end this is what we're
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1337440,1342480,doing sometimes when things are really  hard to do  you think oh my god i gotta stop doing
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1342480,1348720,this but once you do it and you complete  it  you have a satisfaction this sense of  satisfaction that you did something
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1348720,1353840,really difficult  that is irreplaceable some kids never  get that and they just stay fat and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1353840,1359520,stupid their whole life  and some kids they get these little  lessons and then they realize like you  can push yourself
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1359520,1366559,and you can get somewhere you know some  kids get real lucky and they get  involved in sports  or martial arts early and one of the
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1366559,1371840,best benefits of sports is you realize  that through hard work you get  improvement  through improvement you get success
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1371840,1377600,through success you get that big  dopamine rush  you get that good feeling you get  confidence yeah you get this
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1377600,1385120,girl yeah you get sometimes i didn't but  you get this knowledge that you can do  something that's difficult and you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1385120,1392480,overcome even though it feels like you  can't  you're going to have days where you suck  but those days are so motivational
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1392480,1398960,i mean that's the bright side of tragedy  so when you come through it you really  will have an appreciation for the
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1398960,1405919,moments without tragedy  you don't really feel it unless you you  get  less life burns you you don't really
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1405919,1411919,feel it  it's one of one of the things that i  tell people all the time because  a lot of people have a hard time
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1411919,1418960,defining themselves they define  themselves by failure  because they failed but i'm like you're  not your failures you're you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1418960,1424400,okay your life is a series of lessons  you've learned now if you just dwell on  the failures
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1424400,1430559,like that's not that's not healthy it's  not smart and it's not empowering  what you got to do is look at those
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1430559,1437200,failures and go well now you know what  not to do  but you're not that you're you you know  you could have done the stupidest
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1437200,1442240, ever but it's not you that's not  you  you're you're a different thing you're
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1442240,1448159,the the being  that's experiencing all these failures  and if you know that they're fuck-ups
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1448159,1454400,then you've learned okay if you repeat  them over and over again  well then i can't talk to you you know
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1454400,1459679,if you keep going back and doing the  same stupid over and over again  well you got a deeper issue
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1459679,1465039,you know i don't know what it is but i  don't have the time  building up that ability to endure
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1465039,1470720,things that's also  a very important mechanism that you  could apply to everyday life
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1470720,1477360,like that the mechanism of understanding  how to endure  like jocko willing's perfect example you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1477360,1483440,know he has that thing on his  if you go to his instagram page almost  every other photo is a watch
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1483440,1490799,and so watch says 4 30 in the morning  because that's when he gets up and he  works out  and he earns the sunset and he does that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1490799,1496159,he's so disciplined and he's got this  saying that's a great saying discipline
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1496159,1501600,equals freedom  and it's true because he's able to force  himself to do that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1501600,1508480,every single time there's no excuses  there's no  breaks there's no days off it doesn't
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1508480,1513520,happen  so because of that you're like you're  not scared you know that you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1513520,1520720,keep doing it you know that you can  continue to perform  [Music]  let me share a few things with you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1520720,1528799,that hopefully will help the pain to  subside  you can read them if you want you can
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1528799,1534159,read them again later if you feel like  it  but honestly man if i spend all this
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1534159,1540400,time typing this out to you  and you don't allow it to be a tender to  your fire
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1540400,1547520,well you're just letting us both down  and you don't have to do that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1547520,1556640,you don't have to do anything  but you get to choose i'm gonna give you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1556640,1565279,four rules  that if you can obey if you can make  these rules a command  i believe not only will the pain subside
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1565279,1572159,but perhaps transformation could take  place  on the inside rule number one there are
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1572159,1577919,no  more zero days what is a zero day
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1577919,1582960,a zero day is when you don't do a single  solitary thing
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1582960,1588480,towards whatever your dream or goal is  in this life  [Music]  so i want you to make a conscious
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1588480,1593919,decision that there will be no  more zero days i'm not saying you got to
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1593919,1600799,kill yourself  but the point i'm trying to make is that  you need to promise yourself
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1600799,1608159,that your new program your new system  will be a life lived of no more zero
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1608159,1613200,days  this means that when the day is over and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1613200,1621760,you look up and it's 11  58 at night  you did something no more zero days
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1621760,1627520,and i don't care if it was one push-up  one sitter  one page of the book you feel me but
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1627520,1634799,just make a decision that there will be  no more zero days  you see when you're in the vortex of
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1634799,1643120,being bummed  and you are trapped in the pattern of  self-sabotaging behavior
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1644480,1652120,you get used to it and the only way you  are going to break out  is with a massive string of consistent
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1652120,1657519,non-zero  days as rule number one
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1658080,1665919,rule number two that you are going to  have to be grateful to the three u's  call it mumbo jumbo if you want to news
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1665919,1671840,flash the three yous  are the past you the present you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1671840,1678559,and the future you and if you want to  love somebody  and have someone love you back you gotta
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1678559,1686080,learn to love yourself  and the three yous are key  you got to be grateful for the past you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1686080,1691760,for the positive things you've done  and do favors for the future you like
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1691760,1699039,you would for your best friend  you feeling bad today stop for a second
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1699039,1703278,and think of a good decision you made  yesterday
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1704880,1712640,that salad that fish that protein shake  instead of a burger or fries did you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1712640,1718000,save money in your past  to buy something that resonated with you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1718000,1723600,and thank the past you are you currently  saving toward their dream or that goal
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1723600,1729919,you have  or that improbable feat then you need to  be grateful for the present you
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1729919,1735679,the last part of the three years is  you got to love your future self you got
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1735679,1741039,to do your future self a favor  i know you might be tired you may be
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1741039,1747039,addicted to a video game or  a television series
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1747039,1753360,not today present self this one's for  future me

7WD7Fw7KrHI,1758399,1764880,i don't care if it's one more push-up  but one more sit-up  or one more page in the book
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1764880,1772320,you see the cycle of doing something for  someone else  future you and thanking someone for the
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1772320,1778840,good  in your life past you is the key to  building gratitude and
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1778840,1784159,productivity don't tell me  over time you should spread that
7WD7Fw7KrHI,1784159,1790320,gratitude  to others who have helped you on your  path

7WD7Fw7KrHI,1878320,1884480,wanted or wanted to know how to do  has been figured out by someone else
