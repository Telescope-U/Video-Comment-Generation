B1ryzixjDEk,0,5600,and it was so real i just let the  cameras roll and what you see in a movie  is the five cameras just rolling they
B1ryzixjDEk,5600,11840,put my little bag down and you played  this track and i just remember i melted  into the couch and just started crying
B1ryzixjDEk,11840,17119,tears tears i had to get past so many  misconceptions around him to really try
B1ryzixjDEk,17119,22640,to just find  who he was in a quiet room you know
B1ryzixjDEk,27279,32480,hi i am basilan and welcome to  entertainment weekly's around the table
B1ryzixjDEk,32480,37840,with elvis  here's my panel young singer from
B1ryzixjDEk,37840,44160,memphis tennessee  give him a warm hayride welcome
B1ryzixjDEk,44160,51920,mr elvis wrestling  get a haircut buttercup
B1ryzixjDEk,51920,58620,in that moment  i watched that skinny boy transform  into a superhero
B1ryzixjDEk,58620,65040,[Applause]  my earliest
B1ryzixjDEk,65040,72400,memory of elvis presley it was probably  dancing in the kitchen at my  grandmother's house my grandma was
B1ryzixjDEk,72400,79040,a teenager in 56 so she always had blue  suede shoes on and stuff she's probably  blue suede shoes dancing around in the
B1ryzixjDEk,79040,85680,kitchen as a kid and uh or or  she also had his films on all the time  so seeing blue hawaii or jailhouse rock
B1ryzixjDEk,85680,91759,or something what about you guys i mean  i think  i had he's always been playing through  the house ever since i was a tiny child
B1ryzixjDEk,91759,96880,and stole my answer it's true i think  for a lot of us that was also the  reality you know yeah yeah and i think
B1ryzixjDEk,96880,102560,you know my dad used to saying can't  have falling in love with my mom  yeah it's been around for a minute wow
B1ryzixjDEk,102560,109439,what about you walton studying all the  great dance moves like from michael or  like footwork from james brown and
B1ryzixjDEk,109439,115680,knowing elvis's specific move that one  that that's the term was it called do  you know austin i often call that one to
B1ryzixjDEk,115680,122880,win though the windmill that's my  earliest memory trying to perfect that  wow  what about you tom i remember the movies
B1ryzixjDEk,122880,130640,they were there was an elvis movie on tv  about every every six weeks and he was  either playing a entertainment a singer
B1ryzixjDEk,130640,136720,who also raced cars or a race car driver  who also sang it seems like there was an  awful lot of movies where is that but
B1ryzixjDEk,136720,142480,then i remember in my my dad and  stepmom's room they had a 10 inch tv and
B1ryzixjDEk,142480,148160,we watched viva las vegas and just the  musical numbers and also the power with
B1ryzixjDEk,148160,153920,him and ann margaret and some of those  dance members i actually thought  that i'd like to be able to sing and
B1ryzixjDEk,153920,160000,dance like that but prior to that i  didn't have really much of an elvis  sensibility yeah i feel like i came to
B1ryzixjDEk,160000,165360,elvis somewhat late like uh  i nerded out on sister rosetta from a
B1ryzixjDEk,165360,172160,young age probably like early teens and  big mama thornton so the first hound dog  i knew was big mama thornton's founder
B1ryzixjDEk,172160,178400,everyone was a record collector it was  like  very steeped nerdum in bristol england
B1ryzixjDEk,178400,183519,and i grew up in this little village  very kind of isolated and so music was
B1ryzixjDEk,183519,190400,the only thing and we had this welsh  radio station we could get over the  estuary and that was like would play all
B1ryzixjDEk,190400,195760,the old school stuff and so i feel like  i would have heard it on red dragon fm
B1ryzixjDEk,195760,203120,lovely  from the well she's over the way lovely  and i like him welcome to red dragon fm
B1ryzixjDEk,203120,209360,we're gonna play some golden oldies and  it was like all the oldies and i think  that's why i would have
B1ryzixjDEk,209360,217760,like heard elvis for the first time from  the welsh radio station y'all remember  that cartoon johnny bravo yeah yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,219360,226640,yeah yeah and i used to be like oh i  love johnny my mom was like baby he's  just trying to be elvis presley
B1ryzixjDEk,226640,234959,she was like so let me put some movies  on so then i started watching some of  the elvis movies and i was like oh okay  johnny bob was just trying to be helpers
B1ryzixjDEk,235040,240080,we had a cinema for a while we did play  the elvis movies so i remember that but  i suddenly remember something this
B1ryzixjDEk,240080,246400,morning which was even earlier i was  really young like five or something and  i went to a school we only had three
B1ryzixjDEk,246400,253200,rooms in the school and it was a  catholic school and i went to church and  for some reason as a little kid i  decided to wear pink socks
B1ryzixjDEk,253200,258880,and the  the tough guys i was wearing these pink  socks and the tougher boys in the school
B1ryzixjDEk,258880,264639,at church got me against someone like  yeah mate why are you wearing those pink  socks you know fairy look we're going to
B1ryzixjDEk,264639,271520,smash you right i'm like oh my god the  pink socks bad idea right  and um all of a sudden i hear this voice
B1ryzixjDEk,271520,276960,the coolest guy in the school the older  guy was called peter dunn and then like  pushing me up against the wall and like
B1ryzixjDEk,276960,282080,yeah pink socks and i hear her hey what  are you doing and they all turn it's
B1ryzixjDEk,282080,287919,pitted up and he's really cool and goes  yeah he's wearing pink socks and he goes  i always wore pink socks and they'll
B1ryzixjDEk,287919,294840,just flip wow wow  that's why the power of life
B1ryzixjDEk,294840,301039,is elvis story of red west saving him  from getting beat up in high school for
B1ryzixjDEk,301039,306639,a similar thing i never thought about it  best friends it was over here it was  over there they were going to cut it was
B1ryzixjDEk,306639,313520,his hair remember  they were going to wrestle him to the  ground and cut his long hair you know  people often talk about um what bits
B1ryzixjDEk,313520,319919,you'd love to be in the movies that's  one of the bits i always wanted in there  which the toughest guy elvis is like
B1ryzixjDEk,319919,326160,dressing in a way in which just everyone  was like what a squirrel they called him  but that meant a whole lot of other
B1ryzixjDEk,326160,331440,things  and the fact that the tough guys hold  him down in the bathroom and they've got
B1ryzixjDEk,331440,336560,scissors they're going to cut his hair  and exactly that happened redwest goes  oh what are you doing and then they
B1ryzixjDEk,336560,343530,become lifelong friends  say hey he's going to be elvis yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,343530,351199,[Music]
B1ryzixjDEk,352080,358240,was my destiny  i did not have the appreciation of elvis  that he warranted uh outside of sort of
B1ryzixjDEk,358240,364800,like a historian museum piece thing  prior to meeting bass i had read the  gerolnek two volume uh biography the
B1ryzixjDEk,364800,371840,first one is the last train from memphis  and somebody helped me with the name of  the second volume i can't remember miss  eugene yeah mystery trick the first one
B1ryzixjDEk,371840,377039,is going up into the army and then  everything is coming back  what i what i did not have an
B1ryzixjDEk,377039,384080,appreciation for was what the 68  comeback special meant to the artistry  of elvis presley up through let's say
B1ryzixjDEk,384080,390960,the first two years at uh at the hilton  right years three four and five that  that might have been when he was caught
B1ryzixjDEk,390960,396400,in a trap  but um and i have to say  i had a knowledge of what we were going
B1ryzixjDEk,396400,402720,for when we were making the movie and i  you know i i've done enough research and  you know anecdotal stuff and talking
B1ryzixjDEk,402720,408479,talking to austin about  what the the 68 comeback special was  going to be and i always thought it's
B1ryzixjDEk,408479,413520,called the comeback special  that that's i never i grew up elvis
B1ryzixjDEk,413520,420400,didn't have to come back from anything  as i thought you know he was a hershey  bar he was as american as you know  coca-cola but that comeback special and
B1ryzixjDEk,420400,427759,then seeing all the work that we've done  and also now seeing what you two guys  you three people did with the uh
B1ryzixjDEk,427759,433919,with the movie from the comeback special  through las vegas i didn't realize that  that was
B1ryzixjDEk,433919,440080,the third incarnation a great american  artist who now i mean great artists do
B1ryzixjDEk,440080,446240,these things where they define  themselves at the same time they define  the era that they are in and i think you
B1ryzixjDEk,446240,451680,can take that premier of las vegas  hilton elvis presley just say that was
B1ryzixjDEk,451680,457919,the apex of the time and it came about  all because of the artistry of a single  single man so i'm from this movie i
B1ryzixjDEk,457919,463680,think i have a  a grand or almost historian layman  historian perspective of elvis was much
B1ryzixjDEk,463680,469120,more important he was as important as  charlie chaplin was to the zeitgeist and  a handful of other people in the course
B1ryzixjDEk,469120,476400,of a hundred years that's what i got  from him yeah  that was that really kind of that  artistic angle was something that really
B1ryzixjDEk,476400,483280,kind of  just sang to me fighting for your right  to to be artistic in the way that you
B1ryzixjDEk,483280,490560,see fit  is  the ark that we follow  you know and that's the arc that all of
B1ryzixjDEk,490560,497680,the musicians that you love fight for  every single day when i first spoke to  baz and he goes we're dealing with this
B1ryzixjDEk,497680,502960,thing of the cell overtaking the art  form that is something that we fight as
B1ryzixjDEk,502960,510560,artists every day what people are always  trying to go oh yeah this is what i want  you to be or this is my lens
B1ryzixjDEk,510560,517518,and it your lens is the most important  thing so when i  um this movie just really got me
B1ryzixjDEk,517518,523839,to feeling that we had a lot of shared  experience he has a lot of shared  experience with artists over the decades
B1ryzixjDEk,523839,529600,for the fight to kind of be authentic  to their story to their life experience
B1ryzixjDEk,529600,535120,you know and you know that's a tough  life experience to navigate a stride you
B1ryzixjDEk,535120,541920,know the line of segregation trying to  tell that story truthfully as it appears  to you is tough
B1ryzixjDEk,541920,548080,yeah i think watching an artist like  define and then redefine himself as well  with like the changing cultural context
B1ryzixjDEk,548080,553360,as well as like a developing man too is  always a really fascinating thing to see
B1ryzixjDEk,553360,559200,fleshed out particularly because you  know we had such a lens that was  magnified  on him you know the defining and
B1ryzixjDEk,559200,565839,redefining of man it's fascinating i  think more than anything from spending  time here in memphis and a lot of time
B1ryzixjDEk,565839,570959,and from finding sam bell and  understanding his early experience you
B1ryzixjDEk,570959,578240,know  his  love of gospel like yeah rock and roll  yeah blues but gospel gospel gospel i
B1ryzixjDEk,578240,583600,mean until the day  he passed i mean after two shows he  would stay up with the sweet
B1ryzixjDEk,583600,589600,inspirations and they would sing one of  whom's mother happened to have a  daughter called whitney houston he would
B1ryzixjDEk,589600,596080,sing with them gospel to the sun came up  now what that told me about him that i  didn't understand was that he was a
B1ryzixjDEk,596080,603120,deeply spiritual person you can argue  all sorts of things you know flawed um  incredible brilliant sensitive all those
B1ryzixjDEk,603120,609600,things but spiritual and spiritual to me  means a gigantic inner life so he wasn't
B1ryzixjDEk,609600,616720,a very verbal person he didn't say like  make speeches but when he sang that  gigantic inner life came out and that
B1ryzixjDEk,616720,621920,and affected human beings it lifted the  spirit yeah so he was a spiritual person
B1ryzixjDEk,621920,628720,that was the thing that i didn't expect  to  come and encounter that's what that's  what struck me as well the sensitivity
B1ryzixjDEk,628720,633920,of him yeah that deep deep vulnerability  and spirituality that he had inside you
B1ryzixjDEk,633920,639519,you look at any icon and there's that  misconception that they just kind of  came out of nowhere
B1ryzixjDEk,639519,646399,you know and so putting his life in  context and seeing i mean that's why i'm  just so grateful that i get to be a part
B1ryzixjDEk,646399,652640,of a film that finally puts his life in  context and gives credit where credit is  yeah i had to get past so many
B1ryzixjDEk,652640,659519,misconceptions around him to really try  to just find  who he was in a quiet room you know
B1ryzixjDEk,659519,665040,i wish to promote you mr presley  and the challenge
B1ryzixjDEk,665040,672000,are you ready to fly i'm ready ready to  fly  tomorrow all of america will be talking
B1ryzixjDEk,672000,675000,about
B1ryzixjDEk,680160,685360,the first thing that came to my mind is  i don't know if i've ever we've ever  said this while we're in the same room
B1ryzixjDEk,685360,692000,together but tom did this very kind  thing that i'd sort of heard myths about  which is he sent me a typewriter when he
B1ryzixjDEk,692000,697760,first got to australia but it wasn't  just the type i was a beautiful  typewriter and i just i couldn't believe
B1ryzixjDEk,697760,703200,that it was kind of one of those things  where i just thought this is worth over  50 bucks yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,703200,708720,this beautiful chrome typewriter but  with it came this letter from colonel  tom parker
B1ryzixjDEk,708720,714720,that this man had written  and  it was so invaluable to me because i was
B1ryzixjDEk,714720,721839,seeing the mind of this this man and so  i typed one back as elvis yeah and i  sent it back and so we sent letters back
B1ryzixjDEk,721839,726959,and forth and it was uh  it was an amazing way to rehearse
B1ryzixjDEk,726959,732959,because i was having to put on paper  the mind of a man it's it takes it from
B1ryzixjDEk,732959,738240,being this esoteric thing and you're  you're you're crystallizing in some way
B1ryzixjDEk,738240,743760,and it and it felt like a lot of  pressure with every word that i taught  yeah you know  i thought is this is this what i was
B1ryzixjDEk,743760,748959,really feeling  and uh it was it was kind of a beautiful  way that we got to rehearse while being
B1ryzixjDEk,748959,754959,in separate rooms  separated by the biohazard security team  of the state of queensland
B1ryzixjDEk,754959,761120,those were based on letters that i saw  that did go back and forth and they are  letters that are load with a common
B1ryzixjDEk,761120,767200,language affection for each other uh  well my boy you've done it again once  you know it's it's all that i can't help
B1ryzixjDEk,767200,773440,but stand back in awe of all the choices  you make and i want to make let you know  that the you know mr so-and-so of
B1ryzixjDEk,773440,780240,paramount pictures has you know there's  just so much stuff that you that is not  the dictatorial uh trope that you would
B1ryzixjDEk,780240,787279,think would become between a a manager  who's just trying to maximize and take  advantage of it there was bona fide true
B1ryzixjDEk,787279,793279,affection and dare we say it love uh  that was communicated  between these two guys for a while i
B1ryzixjDEk,793279,798639,mean all of us i think us us getting to  spend so much time together yeah prior
B1ryzixjDEk,798639,804079,to fear  it's
B1ryzixjDEk,804079,810800,probably worth reminding ourselves that  we do plays and these are players that's  what actors are called in the old days
B1ryzixjDEk,810800,816560,and you can't play for living if you're  fearful so the number one thing i like  to do is create an environment where
B1ryzixjDEk,816560,822720,fear is left outside and in the circle  that we're living and creating in  there's not fear there's room to play
B1ryzixjDEk,822720,828800,now we thought we would go out to  australia and play for three months none  of us saw that that i would go out and i
B1ryzixjDEk,828800,833839,did not leave queensland forget  australia i didn't leave that for two  years and there was the shutdown and the
B1ryzixjDEk,833839,839920,film was maybe going to go away and all  of that and then when finally i'm  talking to tom and it gave us time to
B1ryzixjDEk,839920,847760,recalibrate and dig in deeper and  finally we make the film and then i  think about moments where you know alton
B1ryzixjDEk,847760,854320,and kelvin and yola and like you know  they have to do two weeks quarantine to  get into queensland in a sort of small
B1ryzixjDEk,854320,860800,box you know with like a sandwich in a  cardboard box coming in maybe yeah  how's it going you're okay
B1ryzixjDEk,860800,866079,yeah fine i can't do it  and i think of all of that i think of  all that but when we finally
B1ryzixjDEk,866079,872079,got back and we're making the movie  after the initial just  you know
B1ryzixjDEk,872079,877519,obstacle and maybe it's not going to  happen  the privilege of actually being able to
B1ryzixjDEk,877519,883519,make a movie and be together and i think  just a collective feeling like i mean
B1ryzixjDEk,883519,888880,tom would i i saw you guys never leaving  the set hanging around talking austin
B1ryzixjDEk,888880,894800,went to perform on the first day in the  in the leather with such fear and  trepidation but i remember tom come and
B1ryzixjDEk,894800,901519,say i've just come and see this you know  and like we just were in a special place  at a special time i think telling a
B1ryzixjDEk,901519,907120,special story a story that when we now  find we are where we are
B1ryzixjDEk,907120,913600,is  worth putting out there because it's got  something to say to the world we're in  right now i miss i missed all the stuff
B1ryzixjDEk,913600,919199,that you guys did and  i wasn't around for that and that that  striked me as if i had been down there
B1ryzixjDEk,919199,925600,it says i got a day off but i think i'm  gonna go watch the shooting i used to do  that i would have days off and i would
B1ryzixjDEk,925600,931519,just come to set and like watch beale  street oh like watch performances i  remember what's your guys scene yeah it
B1ryzixjDEk,931519,939560,was so much fun uh gary clark jr yes yes  me too  and shankar is
B1ryzixjDEk,951279,958000,i've been inspired  i think it's also because every  performance in each artist was so  different yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,958000,964320,and they all had a moment too they had a  rich beauty so powerful and magical in  their own little ways so it made you
B1ryzixjDEk,964320,970480,want to like see what they're doing and  what they're saying yeah well you know  it translates to the screen because like  in ken i've been to can when i was like
B1ryzixjDEk,970480,975600,29 i've opened it twice i'm in can and  when little richard comes on and does
B1ryzixjDEk,975600,980959,where they applaud it doesn't happen  they they broke down too spontaneous
B1ryzixjDEk,980959,988720,applause like they were in that club  handy and that came from the the energy  that was alive in every set radiating on
B1ryzixjDEk,988720,994399,the screen he was in the making a movie  for real that scene  just like all the extras
B1ryzixjDEk,994399,997120,the extras
B1ryzixjDEk,1004560,1009600,we would be behind the scenes right  before simba said yeah they would be  like these guys talking to us and we'd
B1ryzixjDEk,1009600,1015920,be remember he gave us a book  like there was a writer there there was  a children's book
B1ryzixjDEk,1017839,1022319,like it felt like i was like okay well  we're in beale street
B1ryzixjDEk,1023440,1029839,that's the now that gets short shrift in  the usual treatment of the elvis you  know rags for riches story they might
B1ryzixjDEk,1029839,1036558,pay a little bit that postage stamp  version of it all but you invested a ton  of time there in  in club handy i mean that's there's a
B1ryzixjDEk,1036558,1043520,major part and i think the audience  said sort of said thank you so that we  get to have that grander understanding
B1ryzixjDEk,1043520,1049280,of  what elvis says in the 68 comeback  special he's sitting there let's say he  says look rock and roll is essentially
B1ryzixjDEk,1049280,1056000,well it's like gospel and rhythm and  blues and we saw where it came from  inside inside you that was great
B1ryzixjDEk,1056000,1061520,some people wanted to put me in jail so  i was moving  they might put me in jail for walking
B1ryzixjDEk,1061520,1065880,across the street but you're a famous  white boy
B1ryzixjDEk,1069570,1076880,[Music]
B1ryzixjDEk,1076880,1083760,but it has nothing to do with us it has  everything to do with us i feel like the  music overlay reflected like the past
B1ryzixjDEk,1083760,1090480,the present and the future  you know you get dozier cat you hear  some rap you hear some trap and then you
B1ryzixjDEk,1090480,1096080,go all the way to the 1950s with bb king  and little richard and rosetta tharp
B1ryzixjDEk,1096080,1101200,that um made it new  but also paid homage to where it all
B1ryzixjDEk,1101200,1106559,originated from and that felt that felt  good to me it felt good yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,1106559,1113440,like i was quite surprised about the  setup of like the soundtrack coming so  early in the process and i was like
B1ryzixjDEk,1113440,1119360,you've got to be a die-hard music lover  you've got to be so about music to see  everything
B1ryzixjDEk,1119360,1124720,through this art and then into just the  scene so when i'm tracking
B1ryzixjDEk,1124720,1130960,like you know we're doing this alternate  strange things strange
B1ryzixjDEk,1131640,1137360,things there are strange things and  happening every day
B1ryzixjDEk,1137360,1144240,and you're supposed to be like  like he's talking through this scene i'm  like i feel like i can see it
B1ryzixjDEk,1144240,1150080,like what's this mind this mind palace  that i'm in so i go into the booth and
B1ryzixjDEk,1150080,1155600,then basically giving me this is the  energy moment and this is the chill oh  yes
B1ryzixjDEk,1155600,1162559,oh and like so i was really getting it  was like an introduction to being  directed before
B1ryzixjDEk,1162559,1170400,like even being on set or having the  part it felt like like psychologically  that i was really in it and that this is
B1ryzixjDEk,1170400,1178080,something that grounds itself in love of  music and i think that's like that's  always going to appeal to an artist to a
B1ryzixjDEk,1178080,1183520,recording artist we're always going to  love that yeah i was there that day that  you were recording wow
B1ryzixjDEk,1183520,1189679,i was in the sound booth and i was  watching yola  and baz watching you two together i i
B1ryzixjDEk,1189679,1195039,really afterwards i said you know i've  seen genius at work seeing you two  together it was like
B1ryzixjDEk,1195039,1200480,this  supernova it was just unbelievable to  witness i remember the first time that i
B1ryzixjDEk,1200480,1206159,heard any music was actually before i  met you and i was sitting on on the  couch in that cabana office space that
B1ryzixjDEk,1206159,1213679,you had and you were like you're like  awesome's outside better let me let me  play you a little something and i was  like i was like okay
B1ryzixjDEk,1213840,1219120,and so i sat down on the couch and i had  so many years ago now and i sat there  put my little bag down and you played
B1ryzixjDEk,1219120,1225120,this track and i just remember i melted  into the couch and just started crying  tears tears tears i remember i came out
B1ryzixjDEk,1225120,1231600,and i met you and i was like oh my god  like i was so moved and this was like  way before we even had that break too
B1ryzixjDEk,1231600,1237360,and it was just like you could feel it i  remember that moment you know all the  walls like baz has this very immersive
B1ryzixjDEk,1237360,1244080,space all the walls were plastered with  like pictures of elvis whole life of  priscilla of all you guys and it was
B1ryzixjDEk,1244080,1251039,just this moment where i was like oh my  god like we're making something special  and the backbone of it is such a deep
B1ryzixjDEk,1251039,1256480,love and respect for his legacy his  music and his life and yeah it was very
B1ryzixjDEk,1256480,1262799,exciting us going to the gospels i was  going to say it again you got to mention  about going to the churches because we  don't remember that we go down to
B1ryzixjDEk,1262799,1268400,churches in nashville that scene in the  gospel tent where elvis and all the  little
B1ryzixjDEk,1268400,1274000,kids are there yeah like that sound is  recorded in churches with gospel sins
B1ryzixjDEk,1274000,1279440,and i mean that was such a gift for me  because people ask about ways in and for
B1ryzixjDEk,1279440,1285360,me that as far as his physicality goes  it was never about the external it was
B1ryzixjDEk,1285360,1291120,never about that for him it was always  about the music moving in people ask how  did you
B1ryzixjDEk,1291120,1297520,how do you find that and that that was a  pivotal moment for me because being in  that gospel church in the midst of that
B1ryzixjDEk,1297520,1303200,song that we then hear in the film but  that was it wasn't just a song  it was there was there was a moment
B1ryzixjDEk,1303200,1310000,where shannon said you know i've got  something to moan about i've got  something to my soul needs to sing today
B1ryzixjDEk,1310000,1315520,and i know you all have something to  moan about so everybody just started  wailing and it was we're wailing and
B1ryzixjDEk,1315520,1322240,wailing and stomping feet and i was  standing in the middle of it just chills  down my body tears down my face and
B1ryzixjDEk,1322240,1327840,stomping my feet and that was this that  was the moment where i felt my soul  stirring into the place where then i
B1ryzixjDEk,1327840,1333520,knew anytime i didn't feel that that i  was off  so i was always about tapping back into
B1ryzixjDEk,1333520,1340240,that field  yeah it's beautiful you know i talk  about keeping fear away i feel like the  music is this
B1ryzixjDEk,1340240,1346240,is this magic ring around the whole cast  and the whole set  you know what speaking of uh beale
B1ryzixjDEk,1346240,1351280,street there was a scene where elvis is  driving back and he's saying he's  looking at the baby yes and we got
B1ryzixjDEk,1351280,1357200,hundreds of extras and we built the  whole of beale street we're there the  other night and like it's kind of not  clicking
B1ryzixjDEk,1357200,1363200,like everyone's a bit like nervous you  know  two in the morning you know two in the
B1ryzixjDEk,1363200,1368720,morning at night  and i'm like oh  there's fear there's fear here
B1ryzixjDEk,1368720,1375440,there's fear here in space and i said to  the guy you've got kanye west's black  skin head turn it out and we turn it up
B1ryzixjDEk,1375440,1382640,and it's playing immediately  and austin's getting out he was like
B1ryzixjDEk,1382640,1389280,ripping this cadillac around and we're  driving the cadillac and you can see  austin going like i'm trying to get to  my friend bb but i'm dealing with fans
B1ryzixjDEk,1389280,1395679,and it was so real that i didn't have to  i just let the cameras roll and what you  see in a movie is the five cameras just
B1ryzixjDEk,1395679,1402320,rolling because the music put a ring  around everyone and going like this is  saturday night on beale it feels like
B1ryzixjDEk,1402320,1408400,black skinhead by kanye west  i was like i didn't know how much i grew  up on movies because i was like i feel
B1ryzixjDEk,1408400,1413600,like i'm in a movie and now i can  actually act  the other way just like well this is
B1ryzixjDEk,1413600,1416600,stale
B1ryzixjDEk,1428640,1438960,whoever once told me when things are too  dangerous to say  [Music]
B1ryzixjDEk,1438960,1449809,i'm going before the show  and nobody's gonna remember  [Music]
B1ryzixjDEk,1452640,1458240,and how are you oz  [Music]
B1ryzixjDEk,1458240,1465110,i just gotta be making the most of this  thing while i can  [Music]  this can all be over the flash
B1ryzixjDEk,1465110,1471120,[Music]  [Applause]
B1ryzixjDEk,1471120,1477279,i worked a lot on the on the voice i  think you know i read a book a hundred  times over um but i think at the core of
B1ryzixjDEk,1477279,1483679,it you know and i we spoke a lot about  this too it was just really important to  play her and to play them i think as you
B1ryzixjDEk,1483679,1490240,know just a boy and a girl who are in  love and that's all that it is you know  just two kids in love two kids against
B1ryzixjDEk,1490240,1495279,the world um so that was it for for me  started with the interviews and then i
B1ryzixjDEk,1495279,1501120,started going through all the music and  then i found this like incredible guitar  tutorial that he did where he was
B1ryzixjDEk,1501120,1506880,explaining like how he improvises and i  was like i always you know my dad's a  musician so i was like you know my dad
B1ryzixjDEk,1506880,1514080,talks like he plays and so i was like oh  bb definitely talks like he improvises  and so i was like watching him explain
B1ryzixjDEk,1514080,1521120,oh why he bends a note or why he'll like  change the the rhythm or the or whatever  it is or why he might like add more
B1ryzixjDEk,1521120,1527200,vibrato on a certain note he was like  it's on his tender or he like is more  passionate or or definitive and i was
B1ryzixjDEk,1527200,1532240,like oh okay i'm going to take that and  i'm just going to put to the teamwork  and i was like and that's how i find my
B1ryzixjDEk,1532240,1539600,my end to make bibi feel like the spirit  of him is in this scene  world you know and it's an extent but um
B1ryzixjDEk,1539600,1544799,i was like i'm going to use the music to  give him his voice i got to do some  digging back in my own background i got
B1ryzixjDEk,1544799,1551039,to go back to louisiana shreveport  louisiana  and um i really just aligned with some
B1ryzixjDEk,1551039,1557120,of those essences it's kind of like how  you were speaking about the church  and like the soul so i spent a lot of
B1ryzixjDEk,1557120,1563919,time back in the soul in my dad's  hometown and did a lot of digging into  our ancestry you know being a descendant
B1ryzixjDEk,1563919,1569600,of mahalia jackson i got to tap in just  tap in to that energy and then
B1ryzixjDEk,1569600,1576400,considering my character and like what  he was  experiencing at that time with being
B1ryzixjDEk,1576400,1581520,so introverted but extroverted  growing up in a house of 12 kids so
B1ryzixjDEk,1581520,1588400,having to authenticate every single  detail about himself from his makeup to  his hair to his suit
B1ryzixjDEk,1588400,1594400,and then segregation and religion and  sexuality being up in the air i kind of
B1ryzixjDEk,1594400,1602000,just like tapped into that and what that  push and pull might feel like you know  what that frustration might be
B1ryzixjDEk,1602000,1608880,and then bringing that to the stage like  he would but it was fun because i was  playing a young electrifying little
B1ryzixjDEk,1608880,1615279,richard i wasn't like  having like a down time i got to be on  fire you know within it so reading about
B1ryzixjDEk,1615279,1620799,her i've read a lot about her growing up  and  sister is a part she had like a
B1ryzixjDEk,1620799,1626559,quietness to her and the boldness to her  because you have to be bold to be that
B1ryzixjDEk,1626559,1632720,out and queer in the 40s who feels safe  doing that  like and coming from a religious
B1ryzixjDEk,1632720,1638840,background like you've got to have the  stones of all stones to  be just that
B1ryzixjDEk,1638840,1644880,bombastic but there was a quietness to  her that i found interesting so like  sometimes brother would be like
B1ryzixjDEk,1644880,1650240,basically like you're holding court i'm  like yes but i'm extra so i can't be
B1ryzixjDEk,1650240,1656159,holding court like how i would hulk or  i've got to do a quieter version of  holding court there's still grace to it
B1ryzixjDEk,1656159,1663200,i'm a bit of a klutz she wasn't and like  so i've really got to kind of get to the  other side i've got to somehow transport
B1ryzixjDEk,1663200,1669679,myself to this this quiet confidence  this person that can just emanate this
B1ryzixjDEk,1669679,1676159,sense of comfort enough artists like  little richard who she discovers you  know as a young kid
B1ryzixjDEk,1676159,1681279,have the space  to feel that they can let all of that  conflict
B1ryzixjDEk,1681279,1688399,explode out and into everything that we  saw and  idolized you know like there needs to be
B1ryzixjDEk,1688399,1694640,space to do that if you're in the south  at that time and you're queer or you  feel like you might be
B1ryzixjDEk,1694640,1700559,like you're not gonna feel free but that  night that that night and like her space
B1ryzixjDEk,1700559,1706880,was a space that artists like that felt  free to be really expressive i think  being the elder
B1ryzixjDEk,1706880,1711919,that was my role was to just emanate  some of that and also try and get up on
B1ryzixjDEk,1711919,1719600,screen a bit because i wanted to like  put a little bit of that story into it  so i turn around to the piano player i'd  be like oh hi how you doing girl hi just
B1ryzixjDEk,1719600,1726159,i would just we'd have we play flirt  sometimes just to like make sure that at  some point like when i looked at her i
B1ryzixjDEk,1726159,1731840,didn't look at her too platonically and  so yeah a bit of playful flirting and
B1ryzixjDEk,1731840,1738640,yeah just  imagining what it would take to create  that a progressive space
B1ryzixjDEk,1738640,1746420,in a an era that no one thinks would be  that progressive  [Applause]
B1ryzixjDEk,1748080,1754070,i wish to promote you mr presley  [Applause]
B1ryzixjDEk,1763919,1771270,we don't do the business the business  will do you i'm gonna do what i want to  do let's sing the music that i want
B1ryzixjDEk,1771270,1776720,[Applause]  being amongst i'm gonna say 200 extras
B1ryzixjDEk,1776720,1782000,we've recreated opening night  uh at the las vegas international hilton
B1ryzixjDEk,1782000,1788480,we're sitting in those glorious booths  and you know i've got my five hours of  preparation on you know i'm uh
B1ryzixjDEk,1788480,1794320,i'm all there and everybody's sort of  looking around for the other guy in the  movie and turns out to be they're
B1ryzixjDEk,1794320,1800720,waiting for him and they're looking for  me and i'm the bald fat guy sitting in  the back but there were that the because
B1ryzixjDEk,1800720,1805840,we were never together because the  coveted protocols kept us separate we  there was no we didn't get to hang with
B1ryzixjDEk,1805840,1812320,each other on this and that one of the  reasons we make movies in the first  place because it's a good hat austin  would be off being turned into elvis i
B1ryzixjDEk,1812320,1818559,was being turned into the the colonel  and i would get to the set and we were  sort of just like waiting for you but
B1ryzixjDEk,1818559,1823760,the electricity  of what we were shooting that day and  the opulence of the set and the fact
B1ryzixjDEk,1823760,1830080,that everybody you know everybody  when you're a background extra in a  movie you wake up in your apartment at 4
B1ryzixjDEk,1830080,1837200,45 in the morning and drive and park in  a the farthest parking lot away from the  sound stage as possible and you kind of
B1ryzixjDEk,1837200,1843840,walk in and then you get processed kind  of like a cog and a machine  but you then get marched over the women
B1ryzixjDEk,1843840,1849679,are marched over and they're perfectly  clothed hair they're you know perfectly  accented clothes they're high heels and
B1ryzixjDEk,1849679,1856720,we're in this very very glamorous  smack  simulacra if i'm using the right word of
B1ryzixjDEk,1856720,1864880,the las vegas and we are waiting  for elvis to start the show when it  finally occurred and i think we all felt
B1ryzixjDEk,1864880,1872159,there he is you know the curtain came up  and there was the music like crazy and  there was an element of there it is and
B1ryzixjDEk,1872159,1878559,that you know we did it many times that  day but every time that curtain came up
B1ryzixjDEk,1878559,1884399,we all felt the same way yeah there he  is we could not take our eyes off it and
B1ryzixjDEk,1884399,1890559,we essentially got to see a an elvis  show over and over again  and not once did it flag and not once
B1ryzixjDEk,1890559,1896399,was it not something that you could not  take your eyes off it that's one of the  most exciting days i've had in a movie
B1ryzixjDEk,1896399,1902080,and nothing was really expected of me i  just had to you know sit there and say a  few words eventually but mostly i was
B1ryzixjDEk,1902080,1908320,just there watching the rock and roll  show of my boy my boy and it was it was  it was stellar you know
B1ryzixjDEk,1908320,1913679,my experience is exactly the same same  one and i'll add to this so i we do it
B1ryzixjDEk,1913679,1920399,boom curtain it's so real and us we did  a lot more than in the film because we  had to serve the story i have crew that
B1ryzixjDEk,1920399,1927360,have worked with me for 30 years and  there's one guy called brett and he's  kind of like you know and he pushes you  know he's he pushes the camera around
B1ryzixjDEk,1927360,1932559,and he's a man of few words and he goes  and you know he might have said like a  dozen words to me in 30 years but we're
B1ryzixjDEk,1932559,1938000,really connected you know you when  you're in a tight crew around a camera  you know they like your your a-team you
B1ryzixjDEk,1938000,1943600,know  and uh  ask comes in the curtain goes up he  performs right all the way through
B1ryzixjDEk,1943600,1950320,cameras rolling everything and i mean  like you said by the ashes they've got  five in the morning they were not  pretending to react no they were
B1ryzixjDEk,1950320,1956240,reacting and during each number of would  do be elvis and do guys like that anyway  we finally called kart and brett comes
B1ryzixjDEk,1956240,1962960,up and he goes you know boss i've uh  i've worked on your star wars  and i've done you superman's and the
B1ryzixjDEk,1962960,1969120,thin red lines man  i mean what's going on here  i've never seen anything like this
B1ryzixjDEk,1969120,1976080,you know he said like i'd pay money to  be here  and i think we all i i thought yeah
B1ryzixjDEk,1976080,1981919,those extras would pay money to be there  like they had the you know they had the  golden
B1ryzixjDEk,1981919,1988480,willy wonka ticket you were down on the  other other end of the stage i was i was  up on the on the thing i was sitting
B1ryzixjDEk,1988480,1994320,next to luke bracey and we watched on in  in disbelief as you came out in you know  the leather jacket and he got the walk
B1ryzixjDEk,1994320,2000960,down and it was the first time that i'd  seen it but i also did want to say i  will also never ever forget watching
B1ryzixjDEk,2000960,2006080,shankar yeah  because that you're incredible but
B1ryzixjDEk,2006080,2012880,shankar  yeah it was i've seen your stuff as well  so much i had the honor of being able to  sit and watch somebody just
B1ryzixjDEk,2012880,2020159,but right  [Music]  i mean i that was a spiritual experience  too i think to watch you know a star
B1ryzixjDEk,2020159,2027200,essentially be born you know to have  something in her sort of break free it  was just
B1ryzixjDEk,2027200,2032320,it was insane you know context important  yes we go down to record gospel singers
B1ryzixjDEk,2032320,2037440,in nashville and we're in that church  scene we're talking about and one of  them is the one you know leader of the
B1ryzixjDEk,2037440,2044880,gang and she's going wow  wow  and elliot wheeler says look you know
B1ryzixjDEk,2044880,2052000,big mama thornton like did it  should she play big mama thornton  she says oh i'd love that blessings
B1ryzixjDEk,2052000,2061000,comes out to australia does a quarantine  and you know she did that number over  and over again perfect every single time
B1ryzixjDEk,2066158,2072800,and then i said look when we start to  translate the language by having doja  cat to a layover to i said how do you
B1ryzixjDEk,2072800,2080079,feel about we do the song and we have  dojo do a wrap over it so that they let  the language in the hound dog which is
B1ryzixjDEk,2080079,2086240,pretty saucy language which you don't  get it she goes oh blessings and then  one day i ring i say hey
B1ryzixjDEk,2086240,2093440,how would you how would you feel about  being in coachella and coming out of a  giant silver robot with dojo and she's
