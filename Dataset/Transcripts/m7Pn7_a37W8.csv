m7Pn7_a37W8,110,2699,"- Before you tell us, this is an incredibly stupid idea,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,2700,5350,"trust us, we know, Alex did the math."
m7Pn7_a37W8,5350,6870,- So according to Bernoulli's Equation
m7Pn7_a37W8,6870,8576,going through this adapter right here
m7Pn7_a37W8,8576,9679,(indistinct speech)
m7Pn7_a37W8,9679,10679,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,10679,11512,but none of that's important.
m7Pn7_a37W8,11512,13960,What's important is that we are going to use this
m7Pn7_a37W8,13960,17560,two-and-a-half horsepower gasoline powered pump
m7Pn7_a37W8,17560,18949,"to water cool A PC,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,18950,22560,"and no matter how stupid it is, you can't wait to see it."
m7Pn7_a37W8,22560,24640,Just like you can't wait to hear about our sponsor.
m7Pn7_a37W8,24640,25580,KiwiCo.
m7Pn7_a37W8,25580,28530,KiwiCo ships out crates that contain hands-on projects
m7Pn7_a37W8,28530,30810,for kids to help develop their creative confidence
m7Pn7_a37W8,30810,32320,and problem-solving skills.
m7Pn7_a37W8,32320,33840,Learn more at the end of this video
m7Pn7_a37W8,33840,35560,or at the link down below.
m7Pn7_a37W8,35560,37260,- You cut me off before we can get to the good part.
m7Pn7_a37W8,37260,40039,This D5 pump has an approximate flow velocity
m7Pn7_a37W8,40040,41490,of 11 kilometers per hour.
m7Pn7_a37W8,41490,43000,"- Wow, that's actually a lot faster"
m7Pn7_a37W8,43000,43833,than I thought it would be.
m7Pn7_a37W8,43833,45520,- Take a guess what it will be with this pump.
m7Pn7_a37W8,45520,46420,- I don't think I have to guess.
m7Pn7_a37W8,46420,47253,I think you put it here.
m7Pn7_a37W8,47253,48829,"Oh, you didn't, you bastard."
m7Pn7_a37W8,48830,53360,"Holy crap, 1800 Watts."
m7Pn7_a37W8,53360,55820,"- Yeah, that's two and a half horsepower."
m7Pn7_a37W8,55820,57180,- 50 kilometers an hour
m7Pn7_a37W8,57180,58650,- 74.8.
m7Pn7_a37W8,58650,59483,- Holy.
m7Pn7_a37W8,59483,61980,"We could conceivably be talking about this thing,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,61980,64210,blowing the tubes off of our blocks then.
m7Pn7_a37W8,64210,66700,"- [Alex] Oh yeah, that's what this entire setup is about."
m7Pn7_a37W8,66700,69000,- [Linus] I love that it's called power fist.
m7Pn7_a37W8,69000,70850,This here is a pump for real men.
m7Pn7_a37W8,70850,72310,And this is not just a pump.
m7Pn7_a37W8,72310,75599,"This is for transferring water, muffins."
m7Pn7_a37W8,75599,79820,This thing could hold a column of water 85 feet in the air.
m7Pn7_a37W8,79820,82800,"Use as intended, how little fun is that?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,82800,86730,"Wow, this is the size of a fricking lawnmower engine."
m7Pn7_a37W8,86730,88540,- A lawnmower engine with a pump on it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,88540,91174,"- Now this ain't a pump, this is a pump."
m7Pn7_a37W8,91174,94500,Now obviously we're gonna need some adapters.
m7Pn7_a37W8,94500,96860,And that's where this hardware
m7Pn7_a37W8,96860,99790,that we probably paid way too much money for comes in.
m7Pn7_a37W8,99790,101690,"Ahoy there, morons."
m7Pn7_a37W8,101690,104310,"How much did this a adapter, to adapter, to adapter,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,104310,105970,to adapter cost us.
m7Pn7_a37W8,105970,108260,"- [Alex] I'm not sure, actually, this was Jamie's solution."
m7Pn7_a37W8,108260,110290,"And I agree, it's not a bad solution."
m7Pn7_a37W8,110290,111123,- Is this one of the ones
m7Pn7_a37W8,111123,113540,where you mix the oil in with the gas or...
m7Pn7_a37W8,113540,115550,"- No, you just put it in here until it overflows."
m7Pn7_a37W8,115550,116850,"I am pretty sure these are gonna leak,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,116850,118030,but it doesn't really matter.
m7Pn7_a37W8,118030,119923,We'll just tighten them until they don't.
m7Pn7_a37W8,119923,121978,- I don't think it works that way.
m7Pn7_a37W8,121978,123222,"- Yeah, it does, they're NPT?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,123222,124055,- What is this?
m7Pn7_a37W8,124055,126180,- I think it might be compressed air fitting.
m7Pn7_a37W8,126180,127013,- Yeah.
m7Pn7_a37W8,127013,129450,"Oh wow, that's got a greater inner diameter"
m7Pn7_a37W8,129450,133400,but it's also going straight from fricking here to that.
m7Pn7_a37W8,133400,137299,I juggle and the last one left in my hands we use.
m7Pn7_a37W8,137300,138133,- Okay.
m7Pn7_a37W8,138133,138965,- Okay.
m7Pn7_a37W8,142050,142883,We use this one.
m7Pn7_a37W8,142883,143715,"- Okay, cool."
m7Pn7_a37W8,143716,145340,"- Ha ha, you did it."
m7Pn7_a37W8,145340,147670,You brought an adjustable wrench.
m7Pn7_a37W8,147670,149970,- This is a perfectly fine time to use an adjustable wrench.
m7Pn7_a37W8,149970,150960,"- Yeah, it is."
m7Pn7_a37W8,150960,153266,- You can round these and it's not really a problem.
m7Pn7_a37W8,153266,154690,"- Holy crap, is this it?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,154690,155980,We just hook it up and go
m7Pn7_a37W8,155980,157580,"- Well, we need the suction side."
m7Pn7_a37W8,157580,160570,- And a professional sucker always brings his hose.
m7Pn7_a37W8,160570,162053,- It's long. - And ribbed.
m7Pn7_a37W8,163570,166130,"My pasty nerd skin cannot take the sun,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,166130,170163,especially after wintering for six months.
m7Pn7_a37W8,173490,174323,Check this out.
m7Pn7_a37W8,174323,176500,We got a big garbage pale
m7Pn7_a37W8,176500,180110,because we figure that makes sense.
m7Pn7_a37W8,180110,181780,There's a lot of gunk floating in it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,181780,184060,"- [Alex] Yeah, Jamie took a filter through it as well"
m7Pn7_a37W8,184060,185209,and kind of cleaned it out.
m7Pn7_a37W8,185210,186440,It didn't work very well.
m7Pn7_a37W8,186440,189460,- The first thing we have to do is just hook it up
m7Pn7_a37W8,189460,190293,"and go, right?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,190293,191125,- Oh yeah.
m7Pn7_a37W8,191126,192850,"- All right, let's put some gas in."
m7Pn7_a37W8,192850,194870,"I love this, this is good safety right here."
m7Pn7_a37W8,194870,198780,You should always have your fuel stored a safe distance away
m7Pn7_a37W8,198780,201120,from anything that could possibly spark.
m7Pn7_a37W8,201120,203280,"- Yeah, Jamie suggested that we should get some gasoline"
m7Pn7_a37W8,203280,204930,on the hot exhaust that's right beside it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,204930,205939,"- No, he didn't."
m7Pn7_a37W8,205940,207200,"Ah yes, primed."
m7Pn7_a37W8,207200,209790,Do we have a little like pumpadoodle for priming it?
m7Pn7_a37W8,209790,211819,"I really don't know if this is the way to prime it, Alex."
m7Pn7_a37W8,211820,213210,- I watched a couple of YouTube videos
m7Pn7_a37W8,213210,214600,and they said that this is the way to do it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,214600,217803,"- Okay, priming means getting the water from here"
m7Pn7_a37W8,217803,219829,to the actual inlet of the pump
m7Pn7_a37W8,219830,221890,"'cause if you run this bad boy dry,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,221890,222722,you're not gonna like it
m7Pn7_a37W8,222723,224450,no matter how much choke you apply.
m7Pn7_a37W8,226600,228633,"Okay, that almost never happens to me."
m7Pn7_a37W8,232610,234810,(motor roars to life)
m7Pn7_a37W8,234810,236403,"Oh, hey, how you doing there buddy?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,239080,240020,- [Alex] So it's actually sucking it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,240020,242920,This is really not a good way to do this.
m7Pn7_a37W8,242920,244130,"- Alex, for crying out loud."
m7Pn7_a37W8,244130,247590,"Here if I just help you line it up, it'll be okay."
m7Pn7_a37W8,247590,248459,- My hand slipped.
m7Pn7_a37W8,248460,249473,- It did not.
m7Pn7_a37W8,250817,252173,"- Ah, okay, that's good."
m7Pn7_a37W8,253259,254380,I feel like Charlie Brown with the football
m7Pn7_a37W8,254380,256250,getting back in there again.
m7Pn7_a37W8,256250,257657,It's a dated reference.
m7Pn7_a37W8,259669,262503,(pump motor roaring)
m7Pn7_a37W8,262503,263336,- Woo ooh.
m7Pn7_a37W8,265033,265866,Whoa.
m7Pn7_a37W8,267711,270044,"Sorry, I slipped, I slipped."
m7Pn7_a37W8,271036,274453,(jovial classical music)
m7Pn7_a37W8,287383,290834,- I'm not 100% sure that this PC is going to...
m7Pn7_a37W8,290834,293630,"Well, it's already dead, so it can't not survive."
m7Pn7_a37W8,293630,295970,"But you know, the fittings that are in here"
m7Pn7_a37W8,295970,297960,I don't know if they're gonna be up for the task.
m7Pn7_a37W8,297960,299940,We do have these ones from Alpha Cool that have
m7Pn7_a37W8,299940,302950,"little metal barbs in them, that should be fine."
m7Pn7_a37W8,302950,305520,"But we only have those in boot with this Sleeper PC,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,305520,307180,I don't know if I wanna hook that up to this
m7Pn7_a37W8,307180,309120,- But first the test on the broken hardware.
m7Pn7_a37W8,309120,309953,- Yeah.
m7Pn7_a37W8,312210,313110,Oh that's leaking.
m7Pn7_a37W8,313110,314832,"- Whoa, oh shoot."
m7Pn7_a37W8,316060,317210,- Maybe turn it off.
m7Pn7_a37W8,317210,319190,"- Yep, I got it, I got it."
m7Pn7_a37W8,319190,320620,Holy bananas.
m7Pn7_a37W8,320620,321990,- I might have just forgot a fit.
m7Pn7_a37W8,321990,323999,"Oh, that'll do it. - Alex?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,323999,324832,Premo.
m7Pn7_a37W8,327361,328944,- Turn it up a bit.
m7Pn7_a37W8,332498,333414,"- Wait, ah."
m7Pn7_a37W8,337467,341400,"Ah, it really seems like it's not blowing that fast."
m7Pn7_a37W8,341400,343238,Let's give her more juice.
m7Pn7_a37W8,343239,344656,"- Yeah, it seems like something wrong."
m7Pn7_a37W8,344656,346864,- Something's leaking.
m7Pn7_a37W8,346864,348265,"Ah, dammit."
m7Pn7_a37W8,348265,349098,- Sorry.
m7Pn7_a37W8,350593,353199,- I just changed into dry clothes.
m7Pn7_a37W8,353200,356410,I think there's just a ton of pressure in the loop.
m7Pn7_a37W8,356410,358866,"- Yeah, it seems like a lot of pressure and not a lot of-"
m7Pn7_a37W8,358866,360320,"- Not a lot of flow. - Yeah, it's weird."
m7Pn7_a37W8,360320,363010,- And I think there's something back here leaking
m7Pn7_a37W8,363010,363843,or something.
m7Pn7_a37W8,363843,365860,Is this radiator leaking?
m7Pn7_a37W8,365860,367860,- [Alex] I think there is a fitting on the bottom of it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,367860,369949,- That's definitely where it was coming out of.
m7Pn7_a37W8,369950,371410,"Okay, let's get that tightened down."
m7Pn7_a37W8,371410,372930,"Whoa, this just slipped off too."
m7Pn7_a37W8,372930,375856,These compressions are not the right size for this tubing.
m7Pn7_a37W8,375856,377440,- I was hoping it would blow off
m7Pn7_a37W8,377440,378490,when we turned the thing on.
m7Pn7_a37W8,378490,379389,"- Well, it did."
m7Pn7_a37W8,379390,381120,"You booby trapped it,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,381120,384300,which makes me wonder how often he screws me over like that.
m7Pn7_a37W8,384300,386479,Do you think we should switch to our higher
m7Pn7_a37W8,386480,388990,flow rate I.D. Barb over here?
m7Pn7_a37W8,388990,390210,I kind of feel like we should.
m7Pn7_a37W8,390210,391810,"- Yeah, maybe. - Let's do that."
m7Pn7_a37W8,393613,396790,- What are you doing? - What the crap.
m7Pn7_a37W8,396790,398020,You see this play here?
m7Pn7_a37W8,398020,399530,"- [Alex] Oh yeah, that's kinda weird."
m7Pn7_a37W8,399530,401003,- We didn't learn anything.
m7Pn7_a37W8,404250,408280,There's a lot of vibration here.
m7Pn7_a37W8,408280,409880,"- [Alex] Oh, the thing fell out."
m7Pn7_a37W8,411637,414133,- [Linus] This is going really well.
m7Pn7_a37W8,415550,416789,- [Alex] Why is this so bad?
m7Pn7_a37W8,416790,419770,"- You know what, it's designed for a hose."
m7Pn7_a37W8,419770,422110,Something that's supposed to have a lip around it.
m7Pn7_a37W8,422110,425129,I don't think the flow rate's much faster anyway.
m7Pn7_a37W8,425130,425963,- [Alex] No.
m7Pn7_a37W8,425963,428260,- [Linus] We might as well just go back to the other one.
m7Pn7_a37W8,429503,430669,- Is that full bar?
m7Pn7_a37W8,430670,431659,- No.
m7Pn7_a37W8,431659,432924,(motor revs higher)
m7Pn7_a37W8,432924,434090,Whoa.
m7Pn7_a37W8,434090,435510,- [Alex] There we go.
m7Pn7_a37W8,435510,437521,- [Linus] Why is there so little like-
m7Pn7_a37W8,437521,439771,Ah (beep).
m7Pn7_a37W8,442808,446730,What I'm doing right now is I am using these quick connects
m7Pn7_a37W8,446730,449910,at the bottom of the Bunta Sleeper PC.
m7Pn7_a37W8,449910,453620,We're gonna connect our gasoline powered pump to this loop.
m7Pn7_a37W8,453620,455550,I was really excited about this moment
m7Pn7_a37W8,455550,458603,but now that it's actually time to pull the rip cord
m7Pn7_a37W8,458604,461060,- This is my favorite PC I've ever built
m7Pn7_a37W8,461060,462710,in the five years I've been here.
m7Pn7_a37W8,463920,465630,"- The D5 that's in here,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,465630,468280,"the like normal computer water cooling pump,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,468280,470270,is having absolutely no trouble
m7Pn7_a37W8,470270,472379,"pumping through our gas-powered pump,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,472380,474210,so we should disconnect that pump.
m7Pn7_a37W8,474210,475960,"- Yeah, I was thinking about that."
m7Pn7_a37W8,475960,477470,I don't know if we can.
m7Pn7_a37W8,477470,478495,"- Really, Alex?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,478495,480660,"- Like I know that you have pretty small hands, but like-"
m7Pn7_a37W8,480660,482176,"- Oh, balls."
m7Pn7_a37W8,482176,485509,(pump bursts into life)
m7Pn7_a37W8,486510,489500,I wanna see some real good performance here.
m7Pn7_a37W8,489500,490740,Let's do FurMark.
m7Pn7_a37W8,490740,492810,- Let's also grab MSI Afterburner.
m7Pn7_a37W8,492810,494570,We can probably over-clock it a bit.
m7Pn7_a37W8,494570,496870,"- I don't think that'll be necessary, Alex."
m7Pn7_a37W8,496870,498720,"- [Alex] No, but this is the shunt mod of GPU."
m7Pn7_a37W8,498720,500340,We can pull 800 Watts.
m7Pn7_a37W8,500340,502190,"- God, it stinks."
m7Pn7_a37W8,502190,503350,Where's the exhaust?
m7Pn7_a37W8,503350,504970,"Oh, I'm right next to it."
m7Pn7_a37W8,504970,508750,"At the lowest setting here, I'd say our gas pump is actually"
m7Pn7_a37W8,508750,512580,not materially different from a normal water cooling pump.
m7Pn7_a37W8,512580,516140,"Looking at the flow meter, she ain't really doing that much."
m7Pn7_a37W8,516140,518169,How's our GPU temps looking?
m7Pn7_a37W8,518169,519740,- 42.8 degrees.
m7Pn7_a37W8,519740,521419,"- Okay, that's pretty low."
m7Pn7_a37W8,521419,524329,"Considering we're running FurMark, a stress test."
m7Pn7_a37W8,524330,526560,- How many Watts are we drawing?
m7Pn7_a37W8,526560,528660,So about 600 Watts right now.
m7Pn7_a37W8,528660,530279,This is a really good water block.
m7Pn7_a37W8,530280,532950,"- Well, maybe I should run FurMark at a higher res."
m7Pn7_a37W8,532950,535080,"Ah, there we go, 370."
m7Pn7_a37W8,535080,537220,- So it's a bit over 700 Watts
m7Pn7_a37W8,537220,539649,- And we're up to 44 and a half degrees.
m7Pn7_a37W8,539650,543840,"The question that remains is, by cranking this sucker up"
m7Pn7_a37W8,543840,546550,and increasing our flow rate to the point we're at risk
m7Pn7_a37W8,546550,548839,of blowing our tubes off our fittings.
m7Pn7_a37W8,548840,550915,Will we get a performance benefit?
m7Pn7_a37W8,550915,553850,"Like me, do you feel as if your whole life"
m7Pn7_a37W8,553850,555519,led you to this moment?
m7Pn7_a37W8,555520,556780,- Yes.
m7Pn7_a37W8,556780,557830,"- Okay, we're ready?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,557830,558663,- Yep.
m7Pn7_a37W8,559856,560972,"- Oh, jeez."
m7Pn7_a37W8,560972,562808,What are we at?
m7Pn7_a37W8,562808,564630,- We dropped one and a half degrees.
m7Pn7_a37W8,564630,566872,"- Yeah, I'm giving her more."
m7Pn7_a37W8,566872,568843,"Oh, that was it."
m7Pn7_a37W8,571860,573970,"Wow, it's really going though, hey."
m7Pn7_a37W8,573970,574803,- [Alex] Yeah.
m7Pn7_a37W8,574803,578779,- [Linus] 35 degrees on the GPU is pretty impressive.
m7Pn7_a37W8,578780,580630,- And I really wanna do a 3D mark.
m7Pn7_a37W8,580630,582270,I gave it a little bit of an overclock.
m7Pn7_a37W8,582270,583610,"It should be stable, might not."
m7Pn7_a37W8,583610,584443,We'll see.
m7Pn7_a37W8,584443,585740,"- This is next level, right?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,585740,587430,"- Most people start gaming,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,587430,591480,"their fans turn on a little bit louder, restart gaming."
m7Pn7_a37W8,591480,593094,We gotta give her more gas.
m7Pn7_a37W8,593094,594973,"Take that, dinosaurs."
m7Pn7_a37W8,597270,602270,"Look at 'em go, that's awesome, hey"
m7Pn7_a37W8,602640,605550,"- Not really, we might be able to overclock our pump."
m7Pn7_a37W8,605550,606600,"- [Linus] Wait, what?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,608720,609720,"- [Alex] Oh, there we go."
m7Pn7_a37W8,609720,611032,She's really going now.
m7Pn7_a37W8,612360,613193,"Oh, we're leaking a bit."
m7Pn7_a37W8,613193,615334,"All right, I think that's coming from in the PC."
m7Pn7_a37W8,615334,618253,"- [Linus] What, this is terrifying."
m7Pn7_a37W8,620860,622798,"Oh my God, is it overheating?"
m7Pn7_a37W8,622798,624889,Is it smoking?
m7Pn7_a37W8,624890,626363,- [Alex] It smells really bad.
m7Pn7_a37W8,627712,629709,"- [Linus] Whoa, whoa, okay."
m7Pn7_a37W8,629710,632767,I think this may be the stupidest thing we've ever done.
m7Pn7_a37W8,632767,633600,"- Yeah, probably."
m7Pn7_a37W8,633600,635360,- We got our score.
m7Pn7_a37W8,635360,638290,"- [Alex] What's really impressive here,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,638290,641070,that graphic score is like 100 off
m7Pn7_a37W8,641070,643050,of when I had the chiller hooked up to it
m7Pn7_a37W8,643050,647253,"- Really, that's fricking crazy, we only hit 44."
m7Pn7_a37W8,649762,651760,- [Alex] And it drew and maxed...
m7Pn7_a37W8,651760,654900,- [Linus] About 760 Watts.
m7Pn7_a37W8,654900,656370,- Yeah.
m7Pn7_a37W8,656370,657470,- Unfreakinbelievable.
m7Pn7_a37W8,658720,660959,I think that D5 pump might be dead.
m7Pn7_a37W8,660960,664693,"She's not moving, no signs of life."
m7Pn7_a37W8,665580,670050,"Wait, oh, she's trying something."
m7Pn7_a37W8,670050,671832,"Well, let's get the shut down."
m7Pn7_a37W8,671832,673470,"Oh heck yeah, I think she's back."
m7Pn7_a37W8,673470,674740,"- [Alex] Oh yeah, there we go."
m7Pn7_a37W8,674740,676100,- That's awesome.
m7Pn7_a37W8,676100,677990,You're all right.
m7Pn7_a37W8,677990,678890,She's alive.
m7Pn7_a37W8,678890,680920,A really important thing to note about the performance
m7Pn7_a37W8,680920,684320,"we saw though, is that we were using pre-cooled water."
m7Pn7_a37W8,684320,687330,So we didn't have to deal with all the extra heat
m7Pn7_a37W8,687330,690200,that a gas-powered pump would be dumping into our loop.
m7Pn7_a37W8,690200,693120,We got all the benefit of fast flowing water
m7Pn7_a37W8,693120,694290,but none of the drawbacks.
m7Pn7_a37W8,694290,696180,"We, I think it goes without saying,"
m7Pn7_a37W8,696180,698230,wouldn't recommend this as a daily driver.
m7Pn7_a37W8,698230,701300,KiwiCo is a monthly subscription service to help introduce
m7Pn7_a37W8,701300,705089,and make stem topics fun and engaging for kids of all ages.

m7Pn7_a37W8,716030,717860,That means you don't need to run off to the store
m7Pn7_a37W8,717860,720620,to get extra supplies like glue or scissors.
m7Pn7_a37W8,720620,722630,"KiwiCo offers nine subscription lines,"

m7Pn7_a37W8,730080,733310,that looks at chemical solutions in crystal formation.
m7Pn7_a37W8,733310,735960,Another one is the tinker level for your tweens and teens
m7Pn7_a37W8,735960,739820,aged nine to 16 that explore spool mechanics and toy design.
m7Pn7_a37W8,739820,742770,"KiwiCo is a great way to keep kids occupied for hours,"

m7Pn7_a37W8,755610,757860,"If you like this video, maybe you'll like the time"
m7Pn7_a37W8,757860,760646,we hooked up an industrial fan to a computer.
m7Pn7_a37W8,760646,761800,"- [Alex] Oh yeah, it was really dope."
m7Pn7_a37W8,761800,763450,- That was a trip and a half too.
