IY0gRMpT4AY,240,6879,look at that there is a port this thing is upgradable let's break some mac 
IY0gRMpT4AY,6880,12240,studios just kidding i really hope we don't break these but mkbhd said that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,12240,18480,there is no way to take these apart to clean out the fans so challenge accepted 
IY0gRMpT4AY,18480,23520,personally i really want to see how apple pulled off you know having so much 
IY0gRMpT4AY,23520,28960,performance in such a small package and getting it cool and with that the base 
IY0gRMpT4AY,28960,34720,m1 max models they actually come in at two pounds lighter which is a massive 
IY0gRMpT4AY,34720,38960,difference because they have a different cooling solution possibly in design and 
IY0gRMpT4AY,38960,43280,definitely in materials now first impressions guys this packaging is 
IY0gRMpT4AY,43280,49280,amazing look at this cloth little strap here the handle and this thing is so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,49280,53440,dang heavy man it is shocking it's pretty small but 
IY0gRMpT4AY,53440,57519,the weight of it is just so dense with parts we have this recycled kind of 
IY0gRMpT4AY,57520,60880,cloth material let's open this thing up 
IY0gRMpT4AY,61600,65439,man i love how apple has this nice presentation and packaging you're 
IY0gRMpT4AY,65440,68320,spending a lot of money but they make you feel better about it 
IY0gRMpT4AY,68960,73920,all right look at this bad boy look at all of those ports on the back side with 
IY0gRMpT4AY,73920,77840,this huge exhaust and then at the bottom we have the inlets and apple said that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,77840,82880,they change the angle of the over 2 000 holes or so so the air like spins when 
IY0gRMpT4AY,82880,87520,it comes in it is incredible and the crazy thing is we actually bought three 
IY0gRMpT4AY,87520,91359,of these mac studios and multiple displays and other accessories spent 
IY0gRMpT4AY,91360,97440,over 17 thousand dollars to provide the very best mac studio and studio display 
IY0gRMpT4AY,97440,102240,coverage on the internet so if you guys want to see how they compare to each 
IY0gRMpT4AY,102240,106880,other which upgrades are worth it the thermals the wattages frequencies if 
IY0gRMpT4AY,106880,110960,there's any throttling how much the ram matters any of those questions and now 
IY0gRMpT4AY,110960,114240,they compare to apple's other macs make sure you guys hit that subscribe button 
IY0gRMpT4AY,114240,118399,if you guys appreciate it and help us reach our goal of 1 million subscribers 
IY0gRMpT4AY,118400,121840,with that said let's take this thing apart now vadim and i spent a ton of 
IY0gRMpT4AY,121840,126399,time yesterday trying to figure out the best way to open this up because there 
IY0gRMpT4AY,126400,132560,are no visible screws fasteners anything to be able to lift it up so we 
IY0gRMpT4AY,132560,136000,did notice online that seems like there might be some screws underneath this 
IY0gRMpT4AY,136000,140800,rubber but also some of these ports back here go all the way through like this 
IY0gRMpT4AY,140800,145680,power cord port it won't allow the bottom just slip out along with these 
IY0gRMpT4AY,145680,148079,usb type-cs so i think we're gonna have 
IY0gRMpT4AY,148080,152080,to figure that out so the first thing we're gonna do is take off this rubber 
IY0gRMpT4AY,152080,156080,ring so for that we're gonna pull out our ifixit kit not sponsored by fix it 
IY0gRMpT4AY,156080,159920,but i fixed it please reach out to keep repping your guys's awesome tools we'd 
IY0gRMpT4AY,159920,164720,love to get sponsored with you let's go ahead and grab a spudger here something 
IY0gRMpT4AY,164720,168320,that's plastic so it won't damage it it was hard to find a point to stick it in 
IY0gRMpT4AY,168320,174240,but i got it here right at this edge and i'm gonna just slowly try to get it to 
IY0gRMpT4AY,174240,177760,go unglued and i just felt something like a little dip in there possibly for 
IY0gRMpT4AY,177760,182480,a screw at least that's what we're hoping for this is definitely glued down 
IY0gRMpT4AY,182480,186080,nicely or taped down yep all right all right all right 
IY0gRMpT4AY,189280,194319,wow okay now what is this what is that it looks like braille hopefully it's not 
IY0gRMpT4AY,194320,198720,like a secret magnetic key that you have to put in there but we see the screws so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,198720,203680,let's go ahead and find the right little bit to fit guys if you guys do anything 
IY0gRMpT4AY,203680,207120,techie at all you should buy one of these kits we'll leave an affiliate link 
IY0gRMpT4AY,207120,211519,down below they are super high quality that one was too big so it looks like a 
IY0gRMpT4AY,211520,217680,t3 bit all right wow apple got these really really tight dang oh and now we 
IY0gRMpT4AY,217680,221840,see it's actually starting to come apart from its casing so it looks like it's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,221840,226480,not impossible to take this apart now as i am 
IY0gRMpT4AY,226480,230319,unscrewing these i have to tell you guys about our excellent new shirts that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,230320,234640,vadim designed this is a nice subtle designer if you guys see the details all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,234640,239840,around this is the m1 ultra chip package so it looks really cool here go ahead 
IY0gRMpT4AY,239840,243440,and check out the link if you want to see the full details and we will give 
IY0gRMpT4AY,243440,249280,you 20 off for now if you use the coupon code m1 ultra at checkout thank you guys 
IY0gRMpT4AY,249280,253200,for supporting our efforts all right we got the last screw here guys i am so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,253200,257359,excited but we might have some more challenges because of these thunderbolt 
IY0gRMpT4AY,257359,262639,ports it looks like they are blocking it from dropping but let's go ahead and see 
IY0gRMpT4AY,262640,264240,all right okay 
IY0gRMpT4AY,264960,271199,well i guess there's more to unscrew that was easier than i thought um wow so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,271200,275280,i thought the whole shell would just come off possibly maybe at an angle but 
IY0gRMpT4AY,275280,280240,looks like this is a nice solid piece of aluminum with these little pads 
IY0gRMpT4AY,280800,285039,that's going to make sure there's no vibration so very cool no flex like at 
IY0gRMpT4AY,285040,290080,all there and here we have all right this is what we were finding before 
IY0gRMpT4AY,290080,294720,online these little blocks of aluminum well there's actually three of them oh 
IY0gRMpT4AY,294720,298800,yep they are antennas these things right here you were right vadim it looks like 
IY0gRMpT4AY,298800,303680,those are the antennas and the bottom of this and this outside edge is actually 
IY0gRMpT4AY,303680,306240,looks like plastic just like on the iphones and ipads 
IY0gRMpT4AY,306800,312319,to allow that signal to come through so very cool now we also see the tiny 
IY0gRMpT4AY,312320,317360,little speaker right over there um and then that just fires what i guess down 
IY0gRMpT4AY,317360,320479,through the little ports on the bottom the air intakes so it looks like the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,320480,324880,next step is to unconnect this whole top portion which is the power supply 
IY0gRMpT4AY,325600,329920,uh and then we're gonna have to release this solid aluminum frame to get the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,329920,335040,actual ports to pop out before we have full access so this is built very well i 
IY0gRMpT4AY,335040,339040,thought a lot of this would be plastic but no it's all aluminum all right we 
IY0gRMpT4AY,339040,343200,have those undone but it's not coming off so we have another screw here 
IY0gRMpT4AY,343920,346400,vadim look at that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,347280,350400,look at this there is a port this thing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,350400,354400,is upgradable okay um i don't know if i can here look 
IY0gRMpT4AY,354400,357919,over here look from the angle i was gonna unscrew that oh my goodness is 
IY0gRMpT4AY,357920,361840,that what i think it is what is that so obviously the ram is not upgradeable 
IY0gRMpT4AY,361840,366800,it's on the soc that looks like you can put an ssd into it and look you could 
IY0gRMpT4AY,366800,371840,probably do that without even taking it apart you pop it in turn it slide it in 
IY0gRMpT4AY,371840,376880,and it's literally right from here just screw that down and you can upgrade your 
IY0gRMpT4AY,376880,380880,sse so it's not soldered on looks like we might have another one on this side 
IY0gRMpT4AY,380880,382720,right here look at that i'm guessing it's the same thing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,384080,388319,so if you didn't spring for a bunch of uh ssd storage you didn't spend the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,388320,393200,money later you should be able to plug that in just like you can with their mac 
IY0gRMpT4AY,393200,397440,pro that is awesome all right let's get this power supply unconnected that's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,397440,401280,probably how it gets powered to the motherboard and bam it looks like it 
IY0gRMpT4AY,401280,406880,does lift up now we have a couple cables here all right here is one of them and 
IY0gRMpT4AY,406880,410160,then this one here is the one that actually connects to where your cable 
IY0gRMpT4AY,410160,414080,plugs into the wall nice and easy to remove it but be careful do not touch 
IY0gRMpT4AY,414080,418800,any of this exposed stuff you can get shocked man this is a lot more complex 
IY0gRMpT4AY,418800,423520,than i expected the layering we have antenna bands and cables going all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,423520,427680,around the outside different shields and looks like even the fan assembly is 
IY0gRMpT4AY,427680,431840,mounted to the outer case this bottom piece looks like it's just like a shield 
IY0gRMpT4AY,431840,434960,to protect the motherboard from the power supply and it's just suspended in 
IY0gRMpT4AY,434960,438720,the air so i think the next thing i gotta do is to unscrew this aluminum 
IY0gRMpT4AY,438720,444560,frame to be able to access the ports and unconnect those all right wow this whole 
IY0gRMpT4AY,444560,448800,thing just lifts up so that's literally for the bottom cover and the power 
IY0gRMpT4AY,448800,454080,supply all aluminum no flex man this is some high quality stuff look at that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,454080,457439,dude is that the m1 ultra chip right there 
IY0gRMpT4AY,458080,462240,on the bottom of it look you got the heat pipes wrapping around from there 
IY0gRMpT4AY,462240,465840,you have this thing that holds it and the screws here literally 
IY0gRMpT4AY,466400,470080,just to lift it up so what is this on the outside then some controllers or 
IY0gRMpT4AY,470080,473199,could that be like ram i thought the rams inside here 
IY0gRMpT4AY,473200,476880,you know what let's just take the stickers off this is angelica's mac 
IY0gRMpT4AY,476880,480720,studio that she's going to be editing our videos on so why not 
IY0gRMpT4AY,481440,483840,let's pull this off alright so that looks like it's some kind of power 
IY0gRMpT4AY,483840,487919,controller right looks like the same thing under this one and it looks like 
IY0gRMpT4AY,487920,491360,something else under here i have no idea there's more of these ships over here so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,491360,495360,it looks like that doesn't matter everything is underneath this uh heat 
IY0gRMpT4AY,495360,499840,pipe and cooler which is actually nice because with apple's new apple silicon 
IY0gRMpT4AY,499840,504800,chips your ram is cooled down as well not only the cpu and gpu chips you know 
IY0gRMpT4AY,504800,509840,what this connector actually looks like the same ones on my mac pro so let me go 
IY0gRMpT4AY,509840,514560,grab that ssd and we'll see if it fits alright guys so 
IY0gRMpT4AY,515520,520240,yeah it's not gonna fit look at this thing this thing is big and a lot slower 
IY0gRMpT4AY,520240,525520,than the built-in one to the max studio but let me see if the pins line up all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,525520,529440,right looks like let me see they look like they maybe 
IY0gRMpT4AY,529440,534640,line up nope they're off a little bit this section right here is shorter apple 
IY0gRMpT4AY,534640,540080,said that the mac studio is not user accessible just like they talked about 
IY0gRMpT4AY,540080,544320,with the macbook pro most people thought it means it's just soldered in but that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,544320,549120,also gives us a clue that it could be upgraded it's just not by the user 
IY0gRMpT4AY,549120,552080,you're gonna have to take it into apple just like you have to do with the imac 
IY0gRMpT4AY,552080,556480,pro to get things like your ram upgraded so that gives us lots of hope and of 
IY0gRMpT4AY,556480,560560,course owc could come out and make upgrade kits for just like they do for a 
IY0gRMpT4AY,560560,564480,ton of mac stuff so that is going to be awesome but next we're going to start 
IY0gRMpT4AY,564480,568800,unscrewing some of these ports on the sides man there are so many ribbon 
IY0gRMpT4AY,568800,575839,cables here i really hope i don't mess something up 
IY0gRMpT4AY,578800,583600,looks like i have to take the ssd off to access the usbc ports on the front and 
IY0gRMpT4AY,583600,588319,this thing is literally taped on and they don't want you to remove it but we 
IY0gRMpT4AY,588320,593760,have to sorry angelica your mac studio is getting a surgery done right now all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,593760,597120,right wow that was easy right there what if i 
IY0gRMpT4AY,597120,600800,just want to put it into the other slot so it's not in the way of those ports 
IY0gRMpT4AY,600800,606160,you know i just plug the sucker in bam tighten it down it'd be cool to see if 
IY0gRMpT4AY,606160,608240,it actually would start up and not have any issues it shouldn't 
IY0gRMpT4AY,608800,611600,you know they designed these to be able to add ssds 
IY0gRMpT4AY,612160,617440,very cool the usbc port holder is done and now let's remove this antenna 
IY0gRMpT4AY,617440,621760,because we're going to need to access the screw below it all right nice and 
IY0gRMpT4AY,621760,623840,easy that's a massive antenna 
IY0gRMpT4AY,624400,627520,let's lay this down yeah you're not going to have a bluetooth problem no 
IY0gRMpT4AY,627520,631280,bluetooth problems here apple made sure of that let's finish off with these 
IY0gRMpT4AY,631280,636640,antennas and then i'm going to try to attempt to just remove these four 
IY0gRMpT4AY,636640,641520,outside screws that hold down the fan assembly and see if we just lift it up 
IY0gRMpT4AY,641520,646080,without having to remove all of these ports i'm really not looking forward to 
IY0gRMpT4AY,646080,650000,putting this sucker back together before we can start benchmarking man 
IY0gRMpT4AY,653520,659840,so long ethernet port who got this bad boy out all right let's try this again 
IY0gRMpT4AY,660720,661839,can we clear it 
IY0gRMpT4AY,663200,667680,nope we can't clear it so now i'm getting rid of everything every single 
IY0gRMpT4AY,667680,673040,thing including the speaker now has to come off just to access more screws this 
IY0gRMpT4AY,673040,677279,is insane it looks like we got a little battery underneath there just to make 
IY0gRMpT4AY,677280,681680,sure all your stuff is saved if you power it off apple actually made a 
IY0gRMpT4AY,681680,685600,little enclosure to make it sound better instead of just having it be free air 
IY0gRMpT4AY,685600,691120,which is appreciated apple cares all right and we got our legacy ports out of 
IY0gRMpT4AY,691120,695680,there and now for the culprit the one thing that held everything together that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,695680,700240,you have to remove everything for the power jack now for the front usbc man 
IY0gRMpT4AY,700240,706080,these are some rigid cables i've got to say no windows manufacturer would ever 
IY0gRMpT4AY,706080,710480,do this all these little screws and cables why not just have the ports not 
IY0gRMpT4AY,710480,714880,be as flush and just have one piece that slides in well apple cares i guess make 
IY0gRMpT4AY,714880,719680,it a really solid system and we also now know that if at any time your little 
IY0gRMpT4AY,719680,725680,usbc connector goes out or hdmi or anything you can fix it yourself it's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,725680,729839,not that difficult all right guys my worst nightmare has come true 
IY0gRMpT4AY,731040,735279,the last ports that i was trying to keep in here without all these screws they're 
IY0gRMpT4AY,735280,740800,all individuals have to come out you literally have to disassemble everything 
IY0gRMpT4AY,740800,745279,to get this out alright guys the second moment of truth man if you guys 
IY0gRMpT4AY,745280,749600,appreciate all of this and effort having to put this back together afterwards 
IY0gRMpT4AY,749600,752720,please buy a shirt all right guys looks like he has to go 
IY0gRMpT4AY,752720,755519,front forward first which makes sense 
IY0gRMpT4AY,756880,760160,oh man this is where all the weight is oh 
IY0gRMpT4AY,760880,766000,yeah nice so it looks like the logo is not 
IY0gRMpT4AY,766000,769680,used for antennas like they've done in the past all of those are at the bottom 
IY0gRMpT4AY,769680,773520,of the system so probably don't put it on a metal desk or anything like that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,774240,778560,and here we have the computer 
IY0gRMpT4AY,778560,783680,we got those dual fans we have this section right here that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,783680,788160,actually curves and seals towards the back of the case in apple's renderings 
IY0gRMpT4AY,788160,790480,they showed it having a gap which i thought was weird 
IY0gRMpT4AY,791440,796640,but it actually is longer super tight fitting in there the fins here are super 
IY0gRMpT4AY,796640,801040,super close together there's not a lot of room there and it's crazy how front 
IY0gRMpT4AY,801040,805920,heavy this is the back side barely wears anything where we have these dual fans 
IY0gRMpT4AY,805920,811360,the front is most of the weight it's all copper yeah it's coated though 
IY0gRMpT4AY,811360,815680,and it's also crazy how small this motherboard is super thin this is the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,815680,821760,whole computer here and the chip is massive compared to other chips the cpu 
IY0gRMpT4AY,821760,825920,and graphics we also just have only two heat pipes coming up here to the cooler 
IY0gRMpT4AY,825920,829839,as you guys could see and they just connect right here they 
IY0gRMpT4AY,829840,834400,don't spread out it's right here in the center which is also interesting but i 
IY0gRMpT4AY,834400,839040,guess we'll see how the thermals go when we actually plug it in and test it out 
IY0gRMpT4AY,839040,843279,all right guys we have to keep going let's get this cooler off because i want 
IY0gRMpT4AY,843280,847200,to see if we have dual cooling from this side of the heat pipes and from the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,847200,851520,other side we know apple is working on a chip that has four chips connected 
IY0gRMpT4AY,851520,856800,probably the m2 ultra or m2 ultra duo or too extreme we don't know but let's see 
IY0gRMpT4AY,856800,859839,if we have dual cooling so we're going to start out by unscrewing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,860560,864000,where our little heat pipes get connected bam right there we know we 
IY0gRMpT4AY,864000,867760,have thermal paste there interesting that's not soldered on all right let's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,867760,872480,flip it over now and get these fans unscrewed and let's pop this thing off 
IY0gRMpT4AY,873040,878720,wow okay that was easy look at that in here that is a lot of space for air and 
IY0gRMpT4AY,878720,882720,look at that look at all these screws holding one 
IY0gRMpT4AY,882720,884959,antenna cable all the way 
IY0gRMpT4AY,885520,890560,just so i can plug in on the other side for this i'm so glad i didn't try to get 
IY0gRMpT4AY,890560,894640,that removed i'm gonna leave that there we have all these fins i saw those 
IY0gRMpT4AY,894640,898400,screws i thought it might be holding it to the motherboard but no so it's only 
IY0gRMpT4AY,898400,902480,these top screws here probably these four so it looks like it's still not 
IY0gRMpT4AY,902480,906800,coming off and this thing that holds down the m1 
IY0gRMpT4AY,906800,910320,ultra chip it also goes all the way through the 
IY0gRMpT4AY,910320,914160,motherboard and it's connected to the cooler on the other side which makes 
IY0gRMpT4AY,914160,917839,sense but dang i would not recommend doing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,917840,920560,this and there is no way that i'm going to 
IY0gRMpT4AY,921200,924880,take apart another one i am just dreading putting this back together all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,924880,929200,right we got these off i can't believe we took so much of this apart 
IY0gRMpT4AY,934080,937840,what's crazy is that it looks like this top plate 
IY0gRMpT4AY,938560,943360,it is literally screwed into the chip or into the motherboard 
IY0gRMpT4AY,943920,946240,because that is held together oh wow 
IY0gRMpT4AY,946960,948200,all [Music] 
IY0gRMpT4AY,953440,955920,there you right the m oh 
IY0gRMpT4AY,956480,961279,no this is crazy the m1 ultra is literally cooled 
IY0gRMpT4AY,961840,965360,to this whole thing is this what is this heat pipes it 
IY0gRMpT4AY,965360,970720,literally goes to this whole block and this backside is literally cooling just 
IY0gRMpT4AY,970720,974560,the back part of it to get it even cooler i thought it was weird having 
IY0gRMpT4AY,974560,978160,those two heat pipes and that is the only way that it's transferring stuff 
IY0gRMpT4AY,979120,980560,literally dual sided cooling 
IY0gRMpT4AY,981200,985440,and look at that beauty right there it is actually hidden well protected 
IY0gRMpT4AY,987280,990880,yes i do see it i do see the apple logo and we have 
IY0gRMpT4AY,991520,994640,this whole thing look at this little thermal material this whole casing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,995360,999600,with that plate that goes straight to the coolers that is incredible that's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,999600,1004000,insane that's copper what's copper oh that bottom plate right 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1005040,1009839,yeah i guess that is all copper yeah it is for sure copper this is all copper 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1010720,1015040,man look at that beauty look at that guys or just like the shirt that you 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1015040,1020079,should buy with promo code m1 ultra for 20 off you have this beautiful thing 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1020080,1025360,with the apple logo man that is incredible and we have 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1025360,1030160,mission successful and look this m1 ultra is literally i don't know half of 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1030160,1033840,the whole motherboard size it is huge and it is thick 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1034400,1038319,and it is incredible it's actually really interesting how it just has 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1038319,1044079,contact where the m1 ultra chip is nowhere around so it really doesn't have 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1044079,1048640,to cool down the memory it actually just passively goes through but that little 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1048640,1054240,shape right there shows exactly the size of the m1 ultra so even though with 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1054240,1058880,apple's animations with the m1 the m1 pro max and ultra looks huge that 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1058880,1062400,literally is the size it is still nice and small and it's nice that there's a 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1062400,1066640,little extra space there for the thermal compound once it squeezes out so there's 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1066640,1070800,no issues with that said let's go ahead and clean it off and see that apple logo 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1070800,1074800,so there you guys go we have that apple logo on there now you know just how big 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1074800,1080480,the m1 ultra is both the package and just the chipset we have this beautiful 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1080480,1084559,look and just how crazy apple went absolutely i don't know 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1085120,1088800,insane building the system i do not envy the people that are putting these 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1088800,1094320,together day to day and just to show you guys the difference here is a ryzen 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1094320,1100799,processor the whole package compared to apple's m1 ultra package that is crazy 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1100800,1105360,but at the same time you see a size difference apples has the ram in there 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1105360,1108480,the controllers in there everything is in there 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1109280,1114080,up to 128 gigs of ram compared to just a cpu so they have an incredible 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1114080,1118159,incredible design guys thank you for watching if you guys appreciate it

IY0gRMpT4AY,1131680,1135840,comparisons and also which upgrades are worth it do you need the extra ram do 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1135840,1140559,you need the 64 core ultra or should you just get the 48 core like this one is 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1140560,1144320,right here or is the m1 max good enough what are the thermal differences all 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1144320,1147919,that stuff that we are going to check out as well as the display compared to 
IY0gRMpT4AY,1147920,1152640,lg's compared to the pro display a lot of detailed videos please wish me luck
