mdi_9o92XcU,770,1660,"- Five years ago,"
mdi_9o92XcU,1660,3800,we visited Robyn and Robert Guyton's beautiful
mdi_9o92XcU,3800,5660,23-year-old food forest.
mdi_9o92XcU,5660,6560,And ever since then
mdi_9o92XcU,6560,9280,we've been excited about the food forest model.
mdi_9o92XcU,9280,10549,- The film that came out of that visit
mdi_9o92XcU,10550,11630,"is one of our favorites,"
mdi_9o92XcU,11630,13450,"and judging by the comments that keep coming in,"
mdi_9o92XcU,13450,15050,it's also one of yours.
mdi_9o92XcU,15050,15883,- This inspired us
mdi_9o92XcU,15883,18310,to recently travel back to upper Riverton
mdi_9o92XcU,18310,19349,to visit the Guyton's
mdi_9o92XcU,19350,21800,and see their now 28-year-old forest
mdi_9o92XcU,21800,23029,and see how the forest
mdi_9o92XcU,23030,25360,and the people living there have evolved.
mdi_9o92XcU,25360,27237,- [Antoinette] We highly recommend you watch that first film
mdi_9o92XcU,27237,28980,"""An Invitation for Wildness"""
mdi_9o92XcU,28980,30220,before watching this one.
mdi_9o92XcU,30220,32669,You can find the link for it in the description below.
mdi_9o92XcU,32669,33910,- And we wanted to say huge thank you
mdi_9o92XcU,33910,36239,to our supporters on Open Collective and Patreon
mdi_9o92XcU,36240,38030,for making this production happen.
mdi_9o92XcU,38030,39594,- Enjoy the film.
mdi_9o92XcU,39595,42683,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,42683,46350,(serene instrumental music)
mdi_9o92XcU,54034,57200,(bee buzzing)
mdi_9o92XcU,57200,60033,(music continues)
mdi_9o92XcU,68460,71150,- Pre-COVID we were getting people arriving here
mdi_9o92XcU,71150,74690,from overseas having seen your first movie
mdi_9o92XcU,74690,77420,and being so affected by it
mdi_9o92XcU,77420,81250,"that they would literally travel from India,"
mdi_9o92XcU,81250,82860,"the footsteps of the Himalayas,"
mdi_9o92XcU,82860,86000,"or from the States, or Europe to come and have a look."
mdi_9o92XcU,86000,88973,Which was very flattering for us.
mdi_9o92XcU,88973,92550,(gentle guitar instrumental)
mdi_9o92XcU,92550,94570,- We had to start having forest garden tours
mdi_9o92XcU,94570,97670,because so many people came just turning up at our door.
mdi_9o92XcU,97670,101299,"And for me, it's really, really rewarding"
mdi_9o92XcU,101300,103570,"because people were wanting to do one,"
mdi_9o92XcU,103570,106100,"and for them to come to the South Island,"
mdi_9o92XcU,106100,108923,"and which as a place is quite hard to grow other things,"
mdi_9o92XcU,110010,112760,"and to see it happen here, it gives people inspiration."
mdi_9o92XcU,115110,116750,"If the Guyton's can do it in Riverton,"
mdi_9o92XcU,116750,118117,"we can do it anywhere in New Zealand,"
mdi_9o92XcU,118117,120123,or anywhere around the world.
mdi_9o92XcU,120124,123874,(calming instrumental music)
mdi_9o92XcU,126071,129988,- The film has been a real boon to us actually.
mdi_9o92XcU,131230,133050,"And quite a nice time marker too,"
mdi_9o92XcU,133050,135027,"so now we can look and say,"
mdi_9o92XcU,135027,136456,"""Oh, it was like that then,"""
mdi_9o92XcU,136457,137820,"or ""We were like that then,"""
mdi_9o92XcU,137820,138840,"or ""We thought like that,"""
mdi_9o92XcU,138840,142319,and that's changed over the past five years.
mdi_9o92XcU,142319,146069,(calming instrumental music)
mdi_9o92XcU,148231,151054,The forest has aged gracefully like I have.
mdi_9o92XcU,151054,153137,(laughs)
mdi_9o92XcU,154210,156810,"It's also become wilder, wilder in appearance."
mdi_9o92XcU,156810,159112,I guess that's a bit like me as well.
mdi_9o92XcU,160430,163599,"It was not an easy thing to do, as a matter of fact."
mdi_9o92XcU,163600,166200,"When we began, we had certain objectives"
mdi_9o92XcU,166200,168319,"about what the forest garden might be,"
mdi_9o92XcU,168320,170647,and a lot of those were around food production.
mdi_9o92XcU,170647,173397,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,174550,178640,"As time's gone by, we've been balancing up my need"
mdi_9o92XcU,178640,181430,to really push the limits
mdi_9o92XcU,181430,183760,"and see what a forest can be like,"
mdi_9o92XcU,183760,186959,but also Robyn's need to be fed from the forest.
mdi_9o92XcU,186960,188890,"You know, for for it to produce enough"
mdi_9o92XcU,188890,190872,"to be able to justify it, really."
mdi_9o92XcU,190872,193622,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,194670,196640,"- So over the last few years,"
mdi_9o92XcU,196640,198960,"we've really been able to focus on the under story,"
mdi_9o92XcU,198960,201030,"because at the start we had a lot of grass,"
mdi_9o92XcU,201030,204300,and once we had the wild gerbil going through
mdi_9o92XcU,204300,206100,suddenly we had space to put things.
mdi_9o92XcU,207640,209270,"It's amazing how many fruit trees you can fit in,"
mdi_9o92XcU,209270,210960,"I kept finding new ones, and finding spots."
mdi_9o92XcU,210960,212520,"And so the more complex it gets,"
mdi_9o92XcU,212520,214034,the more room is for other things.
mdi_9o92XcU,214034,216784,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,220596,222310,I really like it being wilder.
mdi_9o92XcU,222310,224569,"And I know not everyone would like it quite this wild,"
mdi_9o92XcU,224570,226597,"but it's really good to say,"
mdi_9o92XcU,226597,228040,"""well, this is a, you know,"
mdi_9o92XcU,228040,229814,"extreme example of forest gardening."""
mdi_9o92XcU,229814,232564,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,238220,241530,"When it's wilder, there's less we have to do."
mdi_9o92XcU,241530,244060,I'm pretty much harvesting and enjoying it.
mdi_9o92XcU,244060,246120,I don't have to do anything else.
mdi_9o92XcU,246120,249019,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,249020,250810,(foliage rustling)
mdi_9o92XcU,250810,252120,"Sometimes a tree gets too big,"
mdi_9o92XcU,252120,253730,but we just harvest a couple of branches off
mdi_9o92XcU,253730,254653,and it's firewood.
mdi_9o92XcU,257590,258782,(wood clatters)
mdi_9o92XcU,258782,260599,"We're getting older, you know, I'm over 60 now."
mdi_9o92XcU,260600,263020,"And so, it's nice not to have to worry"
mdi_9o92XcU,263020,265720,"about keeping the edges tidy, or that kind of stuff."
mdi_9o92XcU,265720,267321,And so we can kinda relax already.
mdi_9o92XcU,267321,268154,(Robyn chuckles)
mdi_9o92XcU,268154,270393,Becoming part of the forest.
mdi_9o92XcU,270394,273977,(calm guitar instrumental)
mdi_9o92XcU,277886,280636,(bird chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,284633,286870,"- With a backdrop of a garden like this,"
mdi_9o92XcU,286870,291199,"which is very secure now, it'll tick over."
mdi_9o92XcU,291200,293230,There's not so much that's demanding of me.
mdi_9o92XcU,293230,295410,I feel I can now start to be more creative
mdi_9o92XcU,295410,298390,"and more inventive in the way that an artist might,"
mdi_9o92XcU,298390,301483,especially now that we have a large tunnel house.
mdi_9o92XcU,305950,308130,"I can grow things in there, which I thought I never would."
mdi_9o92XcU,308130,311350,"For example, banana, or passion fruit,"
mdi_9o92XcU,311350,314080,"or guava, and all these different plants"
mdi_9o92XcU,314080,316300,"that grow further north out of doors,"
mdi_9o92XcU,316300,319793,but certainly don't grow down here in Southland.
mdi_9o92XcU,322320,323480,"So that's very exciting,"
mdi_9o92XcU,323480,326383,cause they bring in a new focus to the garden.
mdi_9o92XcU,329720,331890,And the other one is trees.
mdi_9o92XcU,331890,335310,"I've always been a lover of trees,"
mdi_9o92XcU,335310,336737,but now I'm thinking
mdi_9o92XcU,336737,339700,"""how can I be more useful to the wider community"
mdi_9o92XcU,339700,341080,"with my tree growing?"""
mdi_9o92XcU,341080,344030,I can really just grow trees here so easily
mdi_9o92XcU,344030,345730,that I need to give them away.
mdi_9o92XcU,345730,348810,And with an overabundance of plants
mdi_9o92XcU,348810,350560,means they're going somewhere.
mdi_9o92XcU,350560,351610,They're going to other people
mdi_9o92XcU,351610,353659,and they're planting them elsewhere.
mdi_9o92XcU,353660,355700,"I would call it a natural process,"
mdi_9o92XcU,355700,359040,the way the gardens beyond the limits
mdi_9o92XcU,359040,360793,of just this piece of land here.
mdi_9o92XcU,361767,365017,(calming instrumental)
mdi_9o92XcU,368710,370530,Something happens to your nature
mdi_9o92XcU,370530,373020,when you're living in a forest garden
mdi_9o92XcU,373020,375666,or in a woodland like this.
mdi_9o92XcU,375666,377232,"- Cool, and now some rhubarb?"
mdi_9o92XcU,377233,378066,- Rhubarb.
mdi_9o92XcU,381303,384840,It's a relationship thing between the people living here
mdi_9o92XcU,384840,386850,and the forest itself.
mdi_9o92XcU,386850,389440,I think the two things happen together.
mdi_9o92XcU,389440,392800,"We literally are both maturing at the same rate,"
mdi_9o92XcU,392800,395000,or in coordination with each other in a way.
mdi_9o92XcU,400660,403173,"It's very interesting from my point of view,"
mdi_9o92XcU,403173,404790,because it's changed the way I think
mdi_9o92XcU,404790,407450,"about how the world works,"
mdi_9o92XcU,407450,410810,and it's made me feel incredibly enthusiastic
mdi_9o92XcU,410810,414630,about the idea that the forest garden model
mdi_9o92XcU,414630,416480,is one of the main models
mdi_9o92XcU,416480,419010,that could be employed by humankind
mdi_9o92XcU,419010,422653,in order to regain our proper balance in the world.
mdi_9o92XcU,427660,431810,"A human being, I think, is an integral part"
mdi_9o92XcU,431810,433450,"of not only the forest garden,"
mdi_9o92XcU,433450,435680,but all of the forests on the planet now.
mdi_9o92XcU,435680,438910,"And I think that when we assume that role,"
mdi_9o92XcU,438910,441450,"we'll be loved by, you know,"
mdi_9o92XcU,441450,442790,"the other beings on the planet,"
mdi_9o92XcU,442790,443793,the other entities.
mdi_9o92XcU,444900,446100,"Especially by forests,"
mdi_9o92XcU,446100,448660,I don't think we're particularly loved at the moment.
mdi_9o92XcU,448660,450883,Our behavior's not been very exemplary.
mdi_9o92XcU,452306,454573,(Robert speaking indistinctly)
mdi_9o92XcU,454573,457323,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,459550,464069,Our opportunity in terms of being forest managers
mdi_9o92XcU,464070,467980,"is extraordinary, I'm most excited by that."
mdi_9o92XcU,469480,471420,"That kind of expensiveness,"
mdi_9o92XcU,471420,474430,and the ideas that come from living in an environment
mdi_9o92XcU,474430,477080,that's generous really has an effect
mdi_9o92XcU,477080,478293,on the wider community.
mdi_9o92XcU,479850,481870,"And that's a lot to do with food security,"
mdi_9o92XcU,481870,483139,"and food availability,"
mdi_9o92XcU,483140,486183,and connectivity between communities and people.
mdi_9o92XcU,487750,489340,"Those things, I think they emanate"
mdi_9o92XcU,489340,490689,from a garden like this
mdi_9o92XcU,490689,493507,because that's how it works with the plants.
mdi_9o92XcU,493507,496173,(calming music)
mdi_9o92XcU,499120,500910,- I've got a new project since you were here last
mdi_9o92XcU,500910,502610,and it's called the Longwood Loop.
mdi_9o92XcU,504380,505450,"We have a mountain range,"
mdi_9o92XcU,505450,507830,"or a hill really, called the Longwood Mountains,"
mdi_9o92XcU,507830,509879,and it's the old trading reach around it.
mdi_9o92XcU,511650,516039,"I realized that 80% of their food isn't great in Southland,"
mdi_9o92XcU,516039,517839,and so we are incredibly vulnerable.
mdi_9o92XcU,518940,520590,I decided that I would way sooner
mdi_9o92XcU,520590,522373,buy off of local people.
mdi_9o92XcU,524210,526570,"Once a week, all the producers and growers"
mdi_9o92XcU,526570,530100,"around this 165 Ks put up what they've got available,"
mdi_9o92XcU,530100,533500,"how many dozen eggs, cheese, mushrooms, vegetables,"
mdi_9o92XcU,533500,536010,"and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,"
mdi_9o92XcU,536010,537910,"an online farmer's market's open,"
mdi_9o92XcU,537910,540230,"and people can buy off anyone around the whole loop,"
mdi_9o92XcU,540230,541779,and put in their shopping cart.
mdi_9o92XcU,543620,547010,"And then on Thursday, a little electric van hums away,"
mdi_9o92XcU,547010,548643,and goes to trading posts.
mdi_9o92XcU,550460,552850,Every town's got a place where we stop
mdi_9o92XcU,552850,554769,"and put all the food out for people to pick up,"
mdi_9o92XcU,554770,556723,and it means that people meet each other.
mdi_9o92XcU,557850,558970,"And they really enjoy that,"
mdi_9o92XcU,558970,560996,"people wanted to buy fresher food,"
mdi_9o92XcU,560997,563280,"than go into the supermarket,"
mdi_9o92XcU,563280,566051,"which is 80 or 100 Ks away for them, and then back."
mdi_9o92XcU,566051,567415,They don't meet their neighbors.
mdi_9o92XcU,567415,569552,- There's a couple of our new jams.
mdi_9o92XcU,569552,571437,"- Oh, (indistinct)."
mdi_9o92XcU,571437,574880,And we worked out that if just 20% of rural New Zealand
mdi_9o92XcU,574880,578210,"spent 20% of their grocery bill locally,"
mdi_9o92XcU,578210,579370,"with other rural people,"
mdi_9o92XcU,579370,581510,1.5 million dollars a week would go back
mdi_9o92XcU,581510,583074,to rural New Zealand.
mdi_9o92XcU,583074,583907,I'll see you next week.
mdi_9o92XcU,583907,584740,- All right.
mdi_9o92XcU,584740,585573,"- Yeah, have a good one!"
mdi_9o92XcU,585573,586406,- Cheers.
mdi_9o92XcU,586406,587239,- See you!
mdi_9o92XcU,587239,588274,- See you.
mdi_9o92XcU,588274,589107,- We're just uncovering
mdi_9o92XcU,589107,590610,what happened before the supermarkets came.
mdi_9o92XcU,590610,594120,"So 50 years ago, each town had many more shops"
mdi_9o92XcU,594120,596320,"and was much more connected,"
mdi_9o92XcU,596320,598650,and I think that global food is seemingly good
mdi_9o92XcU,598650,599760,"at the start,"
mdi_9o92XcU,599760,601814,"but in the big picture, it's not good."
mdi_9o92XcU,601814,602995,"You know, there was a blip,"
mdi_9o92XcU,602995,604500,"and we have to go back to, you know,"
mdi_9o92XcU,604500,607420,"local, carbon neutral traveling, trading,"
mdi_9o92XcU,607420,608880,fresh stuff without the food waste.
mdi_9o92XcU,608880,611300,"There's a lot of food waste for the supermarkets,"
mdi_9o92XcU,611300,613701,"and travel miles, and everything that gets thrown out."
mdi_9o92XcU,613702,615920,(bag rustling)
mdi_9o92XcU,615920,617980,"The whole idea is that if we can do it right,"
mdi_9o92XcU,617980,619639,"if we model for the rest of the world,"
mdi_9o92XcU,619640,620860,and I really worry about
mdi_9o92XcU,620860,622790,"if we don't get this system in place, something goes wrong,"
mdi_9o92XcU,622790,625959,that the global food giant collapses for some reason.
mdi_9o92XcU,625960,628840,I think that's really important for people to realize
mdi_9o92XcU,628840,630350,"where your food comes from,"
mdi_9o92XcU,630350,633550,"source it locally, and support your growers."
mdi_9o92XcU,633550,634383,"Because if you don't,"
mdi_9o92XcU,634383,636410,they won't be there for you when you need them.
mdi_9o92XcU,637569,641037,(calming instrumental)
mdi_9o92XcU,641038,643788,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,654900,656483,"- One thing that disturbs me,"
mdi_9o92XcU,656483,658100,I've heard this from a number of people
mdi_9o92XcU,658100,659899,"is that they've had beautiful gardens,"
mdi_9o92XcU,659900,662431,"but then they've gotten elderly and had to go to a home,"
mdi_9o92XcU,662431,664460,"or retire to another property,"
mdi_9o92XcU,664460,667410,"and when they leave, in come the developers"
mdi_9o92XcU,667410,669573,and the work of a lifetime is destroyed.
mdi_9o92XcU,671030,672750,"From older people who I've talked to,"
mdi_9o92XcU,672750,674683,"that's devastating, it's just awful."
mdi_9o92XcU,676030,678000,My hope here with this garden
mdi_9o92XcU,678000,680950,"is not that it will continue exactly as it is now,"
mdi_9o92XcU,680950,684180,"because it won't, trees don't, trees get bigger,"
mdi_9o92XcU,684180,686940,"and they change, it's a natural succession,"
mdi_9o92XcU,686940,689190,and I'm not trying to fight that.
mdi_9o92XcU,689190,690440,I wanna make it impossible
mdi_9o92XcU,690440,693823,for the developers to do anything with.
mdi_9o92XcU,696310,697143,"With that in mind,"
mdi_9o92XcU,697143,701090,I'm planting now examples of forest giants.
mdi_9o92XcU,701090,705740,"Such as Totara, Rimu, Kahikatea, Kauri,"
mdi_9o92XcU,705740,710170,"those great New Zealand, long lasting conifers,"
mdi_9o92XcU,710170,711003,and so on.
mdi_9o92XcU,711003,714907,That with a bit of good fortune might last a thousand years.
mdi_9o92XcU,714907,718290,"So I'm figuring that if I plant those now,"
mdi_9o92XcU,718290,720630,"it'll be quite a long time before they're oversized,"
mdi_9o92XcU,720630,724632,that'll interfere with how this forest garden works.
mdi_9o92XcU,724632,727382,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,731430,734640,When I expire and I'm covered in leaves
mdi_9o92XcU,734640,737520,"and left to decompose out here in the garden,"
mdi_9o92XcU,737520,739280,the world will have changed so much
mdi_9o92XcU,739280,743170,that no one will be cutting down big established trees.
mdi_9o92XcU,743170,745570,"They'll be regarded the way they should be regarded,"
mdi_9o92XcU,745570,746403,as treasure.
mdi_9o92XcU,748830,751110,"I'm getting in now, I'm doing the planting now,"
mdi_9o92XcU,751110,752720,because I think that when that happens
mdi_9o92XcU,752720,754326,"I don't want people just to go,"
mdi_9o92XcU,754327,755720,"""oh, we better get planting."""
mdi_9o92XcU,755720,756886,"I want people to think,"
mdi_9o92XcU,756887,759660,"""wow, that was planted a long time ago!"""
mdi_9o92XcU,759660,761462,And I'll be laughing in my grave.

mdi_9o92XcU,762951,766201,(calming instrumental)
mdi_9o92XcU,774980,776130,"- When we came to Riverton,"
mdi_9o92XcU,776130,778170,we had a lot of older gardeners join our group
mdi_9o92XcU,778170,779498,"and taught us (indistinct) things,"
mdi_9o92XcU,779499,783030,and so I've really wanted to capture all the information
mdi_9o92XcU,783030,785580,through the environment center and education works.
mdi_9o92XcU,787720,789689,"It's nice that now it's trendy, people want to know."
mdi_9o92XcU,789690,791860,"But for a long time, no one really cared."
mdi_9o92XcU,791860,793829,They just wanted their (indistinct) at the supermarket.
mdi_9o92XcU,793830,796327,"And now I'm so lucky that people have said,"
mdi_9o92XcU,796327,797877,"""Oh, we want to do this again."""
mdi_9o92XcU,800190,802690,"It's nice when you get older to be considered,"
mdi_9o92XcU,802690,803861,"you know, wise old folk."
mdi_9o92XcU,803861,804930,(Robyn laughs)
mdi_9o92XcU,804930,809110,I think it's a privilege that people listen to us
mdi_9o92XcU,809110,811345,and make changes in their life for the better.
mdi_9o92XcU,811345,814428,(lettuce crunching)
mdi_9o92XcU,816020,821020,- I'm ridiculously optimistic about the future.
mdi_9o92XcU,821060,823190,I also am fully aware
mdi_9o92XcU,823190,828170,that this is the most dangerous time we've ever lived in.
mdi_9o92XcU,828170,829810,Particularly because a lot of those systems
mdi_9o92XcU,829810,831430,"appear to be coming to the end,"
mdi_9o92XcU,831430,834330,we do appear to be on the brink.
mdi_9o92XcU,834330,839140,"But I think that the way human consciousness is,"
mdi_9o92XcU,839140,841940,that those transformative moments are at moments
mdi_9o92XcU,841940,842980,of great danger.
mdi_9o92XcU,842980,844889,"And I think that we're at one now,"
mdi_9o92XcU,844890,846970,and we're at the most significant one.
mdi_9o92XcU,846970,849886,(plants crunching)
mdi_9o92XcU,851800,854410,"When the world was more forested,"
mdi_9o92XcU,854410,857360,and the people living in those forest woodlands
mdi_9o92XcU,857360,860350,"did have a relationship that was reciprocal,"
mdi_9o92XcU,860350,863870,"and was generous, and that was functioning."
mdi_9o92XcU,863870,866529,I think that has to happen again.
mdi_9o92XcU,866530,868200,"And this little model here,"
mdi_9o92XcU,868200,869500,there are lots of other models
mdi_9o92XcU,869500,871260,"that work just as well as this one,"
mdi_9o92XcU,871260,872680,"but this little model here,"
mdi_9o92XcU,872680,876646,"from my point of view, is a really good example."
mdi_9o92XcU,876646,880300,(birds chirping)
mdi_9o92XcU,880300,885300,People can be meaningfully engaged in activities
mdi_9o92XcU,885540,886649,that support themselves.
mdi_9o92XcU,886650,887730,"They can grow their own food,"
mdi_9o92XcU,887730,891040,"they can produce materials for building,"
mdi_9o92XcU,891040,894930,"they can keep bees, all the different things you can do."
mdi_9o92XcU,894930,898070,"The opportunities that need people,"
mdi_9o92XcU,898070,901310,it's the opposite of industrialization
mdi_9o92XcU,901310,904230,or intensification where you need hardly anybody
mdi_9o92XcU,904230,907857,"cause machines are doing it, or herbicides are doing it,"
mdi_9o92XcU,907857,910673,"but when you put people back into an environment,"
mdi_9o92XcU,911780,916780,"help them to make it worthwhile and healthy,"
mdi_9o92XcU,916970,918560,especially for your mind.
mdi_9o92XcU,918560,922174,This is the way forward for humanity in my view.
