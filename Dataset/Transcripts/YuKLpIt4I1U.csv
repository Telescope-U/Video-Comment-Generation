YuKLpIt4I1U,1480,3230,thanks to the support of my Patreons.
YuKLpIt4I1U,3230,4880,So if you enjoy the videos
YuKLpIt4I1U,4880,6570,"and you wanna support what I do,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,6570,8590,you'll find a link to my Patreon page
YuKLpIt4I1U,8590,9750,in the description box.
YuKLpIt4I1U,9750,12040,"1811, Nottingham, England,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,12040,14510,the Industrial Revolution had spread all over the country
YuKLpIt4I1U,14510,17240,with new factories appearing on a monthly basis.
YuKLpIt4I1U,17240,19550,"The textile industry grew tremendously,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,19550,22000,"therefore, securing jobs for skilled workers."
YuKLpIt4I1U,22000,24500,"However, the British economy suffered greatly"
YuKLpIt4I1U,24500,27350,"in 1810 to 1812, largely because"
YuKLpIt4I1U,27350,29820,of the high cost of the Napoleonic Wars.
YuKLpIt4I1U,29820,32410,Unemployment and inflation were on the rise.
YuKLpIt4I1U,32410,34120,The manufacturing industry adapted
YuKLpIt4I1U,34120,36489,to these new constraints by increasing its use
YuKLpIt4I1U,36490,39350,"of modern, automated textile equipment"
YuKLpIt4I1U,39350,41809,that allowed them to get rid of a good amount
YuKLpIt4I1U,41810,44540,of workers and make significant spending cuts.
YuKLpIt4I1U,44540,46480,"Now on the nights in 1811,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,46480,50180,a secret earth-based organization called the Luddites
YuKLpIt4I1U,50180,52930,set out to destroy textile machines as a way
YuKLpIt4I1U,52930,54890,to protest against the replacement
YuKLpIt4I1U,54890,57059,of workers by new technologies.
YuKLpIt4I1U,57060,60010,The movement lasted for five years and became symbolic
YuKLpIt4I1U,60010,62890,of the struggle of working classes against the elite.
YuKLpIt4I1U,62890,65040,Legal and military force was used
YuKLpIt4I1U,65040,67190,"against the protestors, especially the leaders"
YuKLpIt4I1U,67190,70060,who were either executed or sent to colonies.
YuKLpIt4I1U,70060,72110,We could argue that the Luddite movement
YuKLpIt4I1U,72110,73730,was the first anti-tech movement.
YuKLpIt4I1U,73730,75080,"And actually, the word, Luddite"
YuKLpIt4I1U,75080,78490,is still used today to refer to the opposition
YuKLpIt4I1U,78490,81150,"to automation, computerization,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,81150,83780,"or anything related to new technologies, really."
YuKLpIt4I1U,83780,85369,Being anti-tech is a spectrum
YuKLpIt4I1U,85370,87590,"from people who delete social media apps,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,87590,90579,to people who live in the forest and now self-sufficient.
YuKLpIt4I1U,90580,92820,My goal today isn't really to go through
YuKLpIt4I1U,92820,94740,"the different ways of being anti-tech,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,94740,97460,but rather to understand what prompts someone
YuKLpIt4I1U,97460,99990,to become anti-tech and how it is represented
YuKLpIt4I1U,99990,102560,and used in contemporary media discourses.
YuKLpIt4I1U,102560,105143,(upbeat music)
YuKLpIt4I1U,107740,110009,"On the internet, anti-tech as an aesthetic"
YuKLpIt4I1U,110010,112090,"is conveyed through the phrase, Cottagecore."
YuKLpIt4I1U,112090,114979,Cottagecore became extremely popular during the pandemic.
YuKLpIt4I1U,114980,117180,"As people were trapped indoors,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,117180,119540,and the overall atmosphere made us
YuKLpIt4I1U,119540,121720,"wanna go out, go back to nature."
YuKLpIt4I1U,121720,124010,Hundreds of thousands of people moved away
YuKLpIt4I1U,124010,127040,"from big cities like New York, Paris, London,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,127040,129350,"to go back to their suburban families,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,129350,131170,all moved to the countryside.
YuKLpIt4I1U,131170,132990,Cottagecore as an aesthetic uses elements
YuKLpIt4I1U,132990,135850,"of the pastoral, long white dresses, flowers,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,135850,140850,"goats, laundry drying outside, rivers, picnics, you name it."
YuKLpIt4I1U,140950,144000,"I personally follow the Instagram page, motherthemountain,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,144000,145940,"primarily for their duck content,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,145940,148470,"ducks in the bath surrounded with flowers,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,148470,150870,"duck with a rain coat, duck with a flower cap,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,150870,151810,it's all very cute.
YuKLpIt4I1U,151810,153160,You can also find this aesthetic
YuKLpIt4I1U,153160,155210,in Studio Ghibli's movies as well.
YuKLpIt4I1U,155210,157690,They depict a simpler time where people lived
YuKLpIt4I1U,157690,161610,"in communities in symbiosis with nature and the seasons,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,161610,164500,something deeply romantic in the literary sense.
YuKLpIt4I1U,164500,166650,So the nostalgia of Cottagecore is adored
YuKLpIt4I1U,166650,168689,by some and questioned by others.
YuKLpIt4I1U,168690,170670,"In fact, Cottagecore tends to romanticize"
YuKLpIt4I1U,170670,173970,an era where things weren't as cute as it seemed.
YuKLpIt4I1U,173970,176090,"As I argued in my video on the topic,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,176090,178239,the large majority of people engaging
YuKLpIt4I1U,178240,181490,"with that trend do it in a very casual, progressive way."
YuKLpIt4I1U,181490,183050,They try to detach the aesthetic
YuKLpIt4I1U,183050,184660,from its Eurocentric background
YuKLpIt4I1U,184660,186400,and bring more diversity to it.
YuKLpIt4I1U,186400,187840,"As an example, the queer community"
YuKLpIt4I1U,187840,189349,really invested Cottagecore.
YuKLpIt4I1U,189350,191580,"Nevertheless, other groups use the aesthetic"
YuKLpIt4I1U,191580,193770,for very different reasons.
YuKLpIt4I1U,193770,196700,Namely to call for return to pre-industrial modes
YuKLpIt4I1U,196700,199730,"of living, depopulation, and white supremacy."
YuKLpIt4I1U,199730,202010,The phrase Blood and Soil used by individuals
YuKLpIt4I1U,202010,204627,"on Twitter or on Altright platforms,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,204627,207959,"""is a nationalist slogan expressing Nazi Germany's ideal"
YuKLpIt4I1U,207960,210500,"of a racially defined national body,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,210500,213940,"'blood' united with a settlement area, 'soil'."
YuKLpIt4I1U,213940,217360,"By it, rural and farm life forms are idealized"
YuKLpIt4I1U,217360,219590,"as a counterweight to urban ones."""
YuKLpIt4I1U,219590,221810,So that's something to look out for when engaging
YuKLpIt4I1U,221810,223560,"with those trends, those aesthetics."
YuKLpIt4I1U,223560,224770,"I mean, the pipeline is there"
YuKLpIt4I1U,224770,226480,and we have to be cautious about it.
YuKLpIt4I1U,226480,228800,Another form of anti-tech aesthetic online
YuKLpIt4I1U,228800,232000,"is #VanLife, #TinyHouse content."
YuKLpIt4I1U,232000,233360,"Similarly to Cottagecore,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,233360,235710,"these movement center around the self,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,235710,238670,moving away from city life to reconnect with nature.
YuKLpIt4I1U,238670,241180,"As I argued in my video on the TinyHouse movement,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,241180,243599,see me casually plugging all my videos.
YuKLpIt4I1U,243600,246050,It is not a social movement as some like to claim.
YuKLpIt4I1U,246050,248980,"Social movement means social/political action,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,248980,250970,being the example of something in that case.
YuKLpIt4I1U,250970,252890,Sustainable living is not sufficient
YuKLpIt4I1U,252890,254640,to call yourself a social movement.
YuKLpIt4I1U,254640,257130,Efficient social movements combine the lifestyle
YuKLpIt4I1U,257130,259470,and the political demands that go with it.
YuKLpIt4I1U,259470,262320,"On the other hand, VanLife or TinyHouse enthusiasts"
YuKLpIt4I1U,262320,264180,mostly seek to detach themselves
YuKLpIt4I1U,264180,267370,from political life or civilization even.
YuKLpIt4I1U,267370,269790,And that is probably the reason why those movements
YuKLpIt4I1U,269790,272650,"are overrepresented by white, middle class people."
YuKLpIt4I1U,272650,274990,People who can afford to detach themselves
YuKLpIt4I1U,274990,277650,"from politics, from what's going on in the world"
YuKLpIt4I1U,277650,279270,because it doesn't affect them much.
YuKLpIt4I1U,279270,281259,"This obsession with a return to nature,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,281260,282470,a connection between the self
YuKLpIt4I1U,282470,285300,and nature is the reason why many contemporaries
YuKLpIt4I1U,285300,287550,of the romantic movement were quite skeptical
YuKLpIt4I1U,287550,288580,"of the whole thing, really."
YuKLpIt4I1U,288580,291199,Romantics cult of the self didn't please everyone.
YuKLpIt4I1U,291200,293670,"Actually, the rise of the anti-tech Luddite movement"
YuKLpIt4I1U,293670,295650,that we talked about in the introduction
YuKLpIt4I1U,295650,297440,coincided with the development
YuKLpIt4I1U,297440,300210,"of this new artistic movement, Romanticism."
YuKLpIt4I1U,300210,302789,Romanticism was initially a reaction
YuKLpIt4I1U,302790,305440,to the Industrial Revolution and the replacement
YuKLpIt4I1U,305440,309510,"of humans and nature by technology, machines, factories."
YuKLpIt4I1U,309510,312070,"A painting like ""The Wanderer"" above a sea of fog"
YuKLpIt4I1U,312070,313790,"by Caspar David Friedrich,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,313790,315350,seems to me to be a good example
YuKLpIt4I1U,315350,317130,of the collision of two worlds.
YuKLpIt4I1U,317130,320530,"Nature, a sea of fog is represented in light colors"
YuKLpIt4I1U,320530,323430,and contrast with the 19th century gentleman standing
YuKLpIt4I1U,323430,327270,"on dark, sharp, aged stones, raw materials for the industry."
YuKLpIt4I1U,327270,329229,"Friedrich, a true romantic,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,329230,331700,wanted to challenge 19th century's zeitgeist
YuKLpIt4I1U,331700,333460,and encourage people to recreate
YuKLpIt4I1U,333460,335639,"the initial, intimate relationship they have"
YuKLpIt4I1U,335640,337970,with nature that the Industrial Revolution
YuKLpIt4I1U,337970,338930,was disrupting.
YuKLpIt4I1U,338930,340479,"The protagonist's strong posture,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,340480,343250,"nevertheless reveals what painter Hogarth,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,343250,344470,called the Line of Beauty.
YuKLpIt4I1U,344470,346300,The shape of his body is softened
YuKLpIt4I1U,346300,348470,by the beauty unfolding in front of him.
YuKLpIt4I1U,348470,350740,The movement of the sea of fog mirrors
YuKLpIt4I1U,350740,352199,"onto our main character,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,352200,353770,conveying a sense of hope.
YuKLpIt4I1U,353770,357479,"Our love for nature will always, always prevail."
YuKLpIt4I1U,357480,359830,"Imagine, Friedrich was resurrected and was told"
YuKLpIt4I1U,359830,362389,that NFTs are now speading up climate change
YuKLpIt4I1U,362390,364240,and sold as fine pieces of art.
YuKLpIt4I1U,364240,366330,"Or in other words, that millions of computers"
YuKLpIt4I1U,366330,369000,are warming up the planet to sell internet monkeys
YuKLpIt4I1U,369000,370830,to Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon.
YuKLpIt4I1U,370830,374020,"Or to put it more simply, we are so (beep) Friedrich,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,374020,376629,"go back to your grave and don't you dare coming back,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,376630,377560,Goddammit.
YuKLpIt4I1U,377560,380419,"Talking about NFTs, recent anti-tech sentiments"
YuKLpIt4I1U,380420,384030,"echo this skepticism around Web3, cryptocurrencies,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,384030,386210,"the Metaverse. The numerous TV reports,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,386210,390039,"articles on data exploitation, online surveillance,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,390040,392190,big tech monopolies have succeeded
YuKLpIt4I1U,392190,395490,"in making the majority of people across all ages,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,395490,398090,social classes dubious of big tech.
YuKLpIt4I1U,398090,400230,"Cryptocurrencies, NFTs appeared"
YuKLpIt4I1U,400230,402640,for many as the solution to fight
YuKLpIt4I1U,402640,405030,"against the lack of transparency of big tech,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,405030,406990,"but the language used, blockchains,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,406990,408410,"smart contract, et cetera,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,408410,410690,"the scammy practices, its shortcomings,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,410690,414520,"the volatility, and the massive online backlash it received,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,414520,418060,really reduced its potential and scope of influence.
YuKLpIt4I1U,418060,421139,Web3 and the crypto world thought to establish themselves
YuKLpIt4I1U,421140,424650,"as the only alternative to big tech's hand-on society,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,424650,426229,and all the problems it brought.
YuKLpIt4I1U,426230,429370,Bella Hadid's latest NFT ad is a good example of that.
YuKLpIt4I1U,429370,431260,Bella talks about a private society
YuKLpIt4I1U,431260,433750,"a new global nation built on peace, love,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,433750,437910,compassion to escape the imperfections of our world.
YuKLpIt4I1U,437910,440870,"As someone commented, ""Private society? For who?"
YuKLpIt4I1U,440870,442900,New meta nation for who?
YuKLpIt4I1U,442900,444919,"Everyone wants sustainability, compassion,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,444920,447220,"peace, and love. This is terrifying."""
YuKLpIt4I1U,447220,449020,"I found it terrifying, too. I'm not gonna lie."
YuKLpIt4I1U,449020,452639,"Everybody wants sustainability, compassion, peace, and love"
YuKLpIt4I1U,452640,455170,and that can be achieved outside of technology.
YuKLpIt4I1U,455170,456430,"You know what time it is,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,456430,458459,it's time to get political.
YuKLpIt4I1U,458459,461042,(upbeat music)
YuKLpIt4I1U,463920,465020,The belief in the potential
YuKLpIt4I1U,465020,467229,of technological advances is a belief
YuKLpIt4I1U,467230,469580,in the necessity of constant progress.
YuKLpIt4I1U,469580,471189,The idea that progress should be the aim
YuKLpIt4I1U,471190,472710,of every nation stretches back
YuKLpIt4I1U,472710,475569,"to the enlightenment where scientific discoveries,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,475570,478210,"the democratization of knowledge and literacy,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,478210,480039,meant that people could see society
YuKLpIt4I1U,480040,481700,advance quickly in their lifetime.
YuKLpIt4I1U,481700,483490,This obsession with progress translated
YuKLpIt4I1U,483490,486060,"into a new economic model, capitalism"
YuKLpIt4I1U,486060,488370,"into greater liberties for individuals,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,488370,490370,"new forms of governments like democracy,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,490370,492270,greater power to parliaments.
YuKLpIt4I1U,492270,494569,Technological progress went hand-in-hand
YuKLpIt4I1U,494570,495860,"with social progress,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,495860,497770,and we can argue that it's still the case.
YuKLpIt4I1U,497770,500410,Technological advances have enabled people
YuKLpIt4I1U,500410,502160,"to live longer, healthier."
YuKLpIt4I1U,502160,504010,They have facilitated manual labor.
YuKLpIt4I1U,504010,506270,They have allowed us to come together
YuKLpIt4I1U,506270,509319,and internationalize social movements through hashtags.
YuKLpIt4I1U,509320,511080,Technology isn't inherently bad.
YuKLpIt4I1U,511080,512479,That's not the point I'm making here.
YuKLpIt4I1U,512479,513659,I won't be a romantic here.
YuKLpIt4I1U,513659,516009,I won't talk to you about indigenous communities
YuKLpIt4I1U,516010,517760,who live in harmony with nature
YuKLpIt4I1U,517760,520890,as an argument against our technology-obsessed societies.
YuKLpIt4I1U,520890,522800,I think this argument is used way too often
YuKLpIt4I1U,522800,524880,by people who refuse to give them
YuKLpIt4I1U,524880,528230,the technological tools that they deserve and they demand.
YuKLpIt4I1U,528230,529570,"I mean, they are doing great."
YuKLpIt4I1U,529570,531120,"Let them do the own thing with nature,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,531120,532990,while we continue to pollute over here.
YuKLpIt4I1U,532990,535440,"I've seen this argument presented by right-wing people,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,535440,537790,but also by people who claim to be progressive.
YuKLpIt4I1U,537790,539889,I'm not saying that we shouldn't embrace those communities
YuKLpIt4I1U,539890,541630,and listen to what they have to say.
YuKLpIt4I1U,541630,543410,I think the direction the climate movement
YuKLpIt4I1U,543410,546269,"is taking AKA, including more indigenous people"
YuKLpIt4I1U,546270,547970,is absolutely necessary.
YuKLpIt4I1U,547970,550050,Their knowledge of nature is so precious.
YuKLpIt4I1U,550050,551253,What I find more questionable is
YuKLpIt4I1U,551253,553800,"that we romanticized, almost fetishized,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,553800,555830,a sustainable way of living that only
YuKLpIt4I1U,555830,558860,a tiny little fraction of us would be willing to embrace.
YuKLpIt4I1U,558860,560769,And we use that argument to continue
YuKLpIt4I1U,560770,563350,to isolate them from modern technologies.
YuKLpIt4I1U,563350,565930,We all have a right to access modern technologies.
YuKLpIt4I1U,565930,569600,"So drinking water, medical services, transportation,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,569600,570970,"efficient transportation,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,570970,573019,in case those services aren't local.
YuKLpIt4I1U,573020,575850,What seems problematic to me is the reward system
YuKLpIt4I1U,575850,577899,we have built around those technologies
YuKLpIt4I1U,577900,581070,that is fed by the ideology of constant progress.
YuKLpIt4I1U,581070,583420,But also by our economic system to the point
YuKLpIt4I1U,583420,585450,where it has become quite hard to define
YuKLpIt4I1U,585450,587430,what progress really is.
YuKLpIt4I1U,587430,588263,"Think about this,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,588263,591060,"in the West, a new revolutionary cancer treatment"
YuKLpIt4I1U,591060,594060,gets the same media coverage as a new iPhone.
YuKLpIt4I1U,594060,595190,But are we really talking about
YuKLpIt4I1U,595190,596580,the same kind of progress?
YuKLpIt4I1U,596580,597740,"As Tom Nicholas argued,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,597740,600779,"in his video on ""The Fake Futurism of Elon Musk"","
YuKLpIt4I1U,600780,604070,the ideology of never-ending progress keeps people hopeful
YuKLpIt4I1U,604070,605980,that the future can be bright.
YuKLpIt4I1U,605980,607860,That humanity will always find a solution
YuKLpIt4I1U,607860,611190,"to the problems it faces, but who is really benefiting"
YuKLpIt4I1U,611190,613610,from that sort of technological progress?
YuKLpIt4I1U,613610,615390,"By that, I mean high-speed tunnels"
YuKLpIt4I1U,615390,617030,"for five people max cars,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,617030,619050,"rockets to see the earth from space,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,619050,621060,or Bella Hadid Meta community.
YuKLpIt4I1U,621060,622580,These are toys for the wealthy
YuKLpIt4I1U,622580,625020,who ultimately want to leave this planet.
YuKLpIt4I1U,625020,627670,"On the other hand, vaccines patents work were kept private"
YuKLpIt4I1U,627670,629940,by Western companies and people like Bill Gates
YuKLpIt4I1U,629940,631640,claimed that we shouldn't give patents
YuKLpIt4I1U,631640,633400,"to non-Western countries,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,633400,635770,and wait till the West can produce vaccines
YuKLpIt4I1U,635770,636900,and send them to them.
YuKLpIt4I1U,636900,638380,"Of course, they came last on the list"
YuKLpIt4I1U,638380,641050,and suffered economic and social consequences
YuKLpIt4I1U,641050,642269,as a result of that.
YuKLpIt4I1U,642270,643980,I really want to argue that the belief
YuKLpIt4I1U,643980,646380,"in constant progress is an ideology,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,646380,649370,"AKA, ""An idea that has been repeated so many times"
YuKLpIt4I1U,649370,651560,"that it appears as the truth."""
YuKLpIt4I1U,651560,653000,And one way to show it is to look
YuKLpIt4I1U,653000,657120,"at how it trickled down to us, how we have internalized it."
YuKLpIt4I1U,657120,659630,"Let's take the phrase, ""Be the best version of yourself."""
YuKLpIt4I1U,659630,661720,"That's a good example, becoming your best version"
YuKLpIt4I1U,661720,663829,means that you need to improve a little bit every day.
YuKLpIt4I1U,663830,665070,The body and mind now perceived
YuKLpIt4I1U,665070,667130,as a machine that needs to be improved.
YuKLpIt4I1U,667130,671460,"Yes, every day, month, year to increase its performance."
YuKLpIt4I1U,671460,673660,The individual who seeks to become the best version
YuKLpIt4I1U,673660,676440,"of themselves will work on their physique,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,676440,678780,"mental health, strength, intelligence,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,678780,680560,using scientific data to figure out
YuKLpIt4I1U,680560,682460,what's the best way to achieve their goals.
YuKLpIt4I1U,682460,685870,"In fact, scientific-based methods of training at the gym,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,685870,689110,of memorizing for an exam are now super appealing.
YuKLpIt4I1U,689110,692310,"Let's imagine that we make two videos with the same advice,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,692310,694870,"but one is titled, ""My 5 Tips to Lose Weight"""
YuKLpIt4I1U,694870,697470,"and the other one, ""5 Scientifically Proven Ways"
YuKLpIt4I1U,697470,699279,"of Losing 10 Pounds in a Month""."
YuKLpIt4I1U,699280,701410,And guess which one is gonna get the best engagement?
YuKLpIt4I1U,701410,704199,"Smart watches tell you how many hours you slept last night,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,704200,706380,"how deep the sleep was,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,706380,708140,encouraging you to improve your stats.
YuKLpIt4I1U,708140,710650,They also calculate how many steps you did per day.
YuKLpIt4I1U,710650,712030,How many calories you burned?
YuKLpIt4I1U,712030,714940,"My experience of tracking steps, calories,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,714940,717900,in the past completely changed my relationship
YuKLpIt4I1U,717900,721230,"with things that in my opinion, should be intuitive."
YuKLpIt4I1U,721230,723560,"Eating, working out, being active,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,723560,725230,a workout session was only good
YuKLpIt4I1U,725230,727430,if I had reached the right amount of calories burned.
YuKLpIt4I1U,727430,729850,A meal was only good only if I had met all
YuKLpIt4I1U,729850,731649,the macronutrients targets.
YuKLpIt4I1U,731650,733730,I think I developed a sort of orthorexia
YuKLpIt4I1U,733730,736560,"and it took me years to go back to the state I am now,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,736560,738960,"my healthiest, strongest, all-intuitive."
YuKLpIt4I1U,738960,740080,"Little parenthesis here,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,740080,741760,"but if you are struggling with those things,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,741760,744200,it's always good to talk about it with a professional.
YuKLpIt4I1U,744200,745270,"What really, really helped me"
YuKLpIt4I1U,745270,747490,"was discovering Natacha Oceane,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,747490,749630,she really put me back on the right track.
YuKLpIt4I1U,749630,751810,"So I highly recommend her videos, her content,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,751810,754760,"and her philosophy around food, and working out."
YuKLpIt4I1U,754760,755593,Just wanted to share that
YuKLpIt4I1U,755593,757240,'cause it's way more popular than it seems.
YuKLpIt4I1U,757240,758820,And many people don't want to recognize
YuKLpIt4I1U,758820,760270,"that they have an eating disorder,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,760270,762480,"but anyway, closing the parenthesis here."
YuKLpIt4I1U,762480,765120,To conclude and connect everything we've said with ideas
YuKLpIt4I1U,765120,767790,"I hear more and more in left-wing circles,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,767790,769560,"especially in France at the moment,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,769560,771700,is the right for intimacy in the sense
YuKLpIt4I1U,771700,776400,"that we should be able to turn it all off, to be left alone."
YuKLpIt4I1U,776400,778270,"We are constantly invaded with lights,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,778270,781760,"sounds, notifications, and it's not always our fault."
YuKLpIt4I1U,781760,784700,Being stimulated has become the norm and prevent us
YuKLpIt4I1U,784700,786920,from having time to just think.
YuKLpIt4I1U,786920,788810,I'm not saying that we should distance ourself
YuKLpIt4I1U,788810,791630,"from the outside world, from politics, or any of that."
YuKLpIt4I1U,791630,793060,You know I'm not like that.
YuKLpIt4I1U,793060,794800,What I'm saying is that the constant flow
YuKLpIt4I1U,794800,797390,of stimulation puts us in a state of paralysis.
YuKLpIt4I1U,797390,799750,We're numbly being drawn back and forth
YuKLpIt4I1U,799750,803330,"by the waves of information, of so-called progress,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,803330,805010,without reflecting on them.
YuKLpIt4I1U,805010,806976,"I'll end with this quote I found in the book,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,806976,810190,"""Psychopolitics"" written by Byung-Chul Han,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,810190,811280,it's Deleuze talking.
YuKLpIt4I1U,811280,813000,"And he says, ""It's not a problem"
YuKLpIt4I1U,813000,814910,"of getting people to express themselves,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,814910,816959,but of providing little gaps of solitude
YuKLpIt4I1U,816960,819320,and silence in which they might eventually
YuKLpIt4I1U,819320,821030,find something to say.
YuKLpIt4I1U,821030,823130,Repressive forces don't stop people
YuKLpIt4I1U,823130,824780,"from expressing themselves,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,824780,827570,but rather force them to express themselves.
YuKLpIt4I1U,827570,830230,"What a relief to have nothing to say,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,830230,831449,"the right to say nothing,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,831450,833970,because only then is there a chance of framing
YuKLpIt4I1U,833970,836040,"the rare, and even rarer things"
YuKLpIt4I1U,836040,837839,"that might be worth saying."""
YuKLpIt4I1U,837840,839410,I hope this video was worth your time.
YuKLpIt4I1U,839410,841100,"I did spend a week in isolation,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,841100,842850,"in silence, more or less,"
YuKLpIt4I1U,842850,845100,to work on this video and the book as well.
YuKLpIt4I1U,845100,847130,"So yeah, don't forget to like, to subscribe"
YuKLpIt4I1U,847130,848630,if it's not done already.
YuKLpIt4I1U,848630,851000,I would like to thank my Patrons for their supports
YuKLpIt4I1U,851000,852870,and a special thank to Kuba
YuKLpIt4I1U,852870,856510,"Jochelle, Karla, Benjamin, Oswald, and Jay."
YuKLpIt4I1U,856510,858644,"Other than that, I'll see you very soon."
