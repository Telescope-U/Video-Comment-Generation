0O8tYfP-zfk,72320,74479,dig out by arise
0O8tYfP-zfk,74479,76640,arise then really didn't have a chance
0O8tYfP-zfk,76640,78400,to turn two but
0O8tYfP-zfk,78400,82000,trying to make a wide throw to first
0O8tYfP-zfk,82000,86080,as he was almost down on both knees
0O8tYfP-zfk,86080,89439,that's when the throw went wide first
0O8tYfP-zfk,89439,93680,and it enabled two runs to score

0O8tYfP-zfk,98840,101439,wall juan around third he'll have to
0O8tYfP-zfk,101439,103680,hold there he thought that kepler was
0O8tYfP-zfk,103680,105759,going to run it down and was unable to
0O8tYfP-zfk,105759,108240,score yeah you got to get a better read
0O8tYfP-zfk,108240,110640,than that you've got to have a field

0O8tYfP-zfk,112000,114000,fielder's playing you've got to score on
0O8tYfP-zfk,114000,116719,a double he was too close to second base
0O8tYfP-zfk,116719,118719,he's got to be
0O8tYfP-zfk,118719,120719,and if he would have caught the ball and
0O8tYfP-zfk,120719,122159,he was halfway he would have been able
0O8tYfP-zfk,122159,124000,to go back and tag up but look how close
0O8tYfP-zfk,124000,126240,he is he's going back there and it's hit
