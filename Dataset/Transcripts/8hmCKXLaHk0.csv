8hmCKXLaHk0,3520,5680,but we start with major boardroom change
8hmCKXLaHk0,5680,7279,at chelsea the club have confirmed today
8hmCKXLaHk0,7279,9120,that long-standing chairman bruce buck
8hmCKXLaHk0,9120,11280,will step down from the role later this
8hmCKXLaHk0,11280,13440,month he could be followed by director
8hmCKXLaHk0,13440,15599,marina granovskaya who's been a driving
8hmCKXLaHk0,15599,17520,force around transfers at the club it
8hmCKXLaHk0,17520,19279,leaves major question marks over
8hmCKXLaHk0,19279,21439,potential incomings and outgoings which
8hmCKXLaHk0,21439,23439,include romelu lukaku and raheem
8hmCKXLaHk0,23439,25920,sterling welbuck has served as chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,25920,28640,chairman since 2003 and will depart on
8hmCKXLaHk0,28640,30720,the 30th of june he'll continue to
8hmCKXLaHk0,30720,35120,support chelsea as a senior advisor
8hmCKXLaHk0,36399,38320,so lots to digest at chelsea and
8hmCKXLaHk0,38320,39680,elsewhere over the course of the
8hmCKXLaHk0,39680,41600,afternoon and with us in the studio
8hmCKXLaHk0,41600,43120,chief reporter carver solikol senior
8hmCKXLaHk0,43120,44719,reporter i'm alissa reddy dharmasheth is
8hmCKXLaHk0,44719,46320,here as well we'll start with chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,46320,49280,then uh cave and those potential changes
8hmCKXLaHk0,49280,50879,bruce buck we know is leaving maybe
8hmCKXLaHk0,50879,53680,marina granoska going as well
8hmCKXLaHk0,53680,56160,what does this mean for how the future
8hmCKXLaHk0,56160,57680,of the chelsea board is going to look do
8hmCKXLaHk0,57680,59440,you think well look in the next
8hmCKXLaHk0,59440,61280,few days we will be getting an update
8hmCKXLaHk0,61280,63520,from chelsea about what the board is
8hmCKXLaHk0,63520,66240,going to look like but obviously
8hmCKXLaHk0,66240,68560,significant development that bruce buck
8hmCKXLaHk0,68560,70720,is leaving the club although it has been
8hmCKXLaHk0,70720,72080,on the cards i think it's something that
8hmCKXLaHk0,72080,73760,we reported first
8hmCKXLaHk0,73760,75360,in march he's somebody who's been at the
8hmCKXLaHk0,75360,78000,club for 19 years he was chairman
8hmCKXLaHk0,78000,79439,basically for all the time that roman
8hmCKXLaHk0,79439,81200,abramovich was there
8hmCKXLaHk0,81200,83040,chelsea obviously were the most
8hmCKXLaHk0,83040,84400,successful
8hmCKXLaHk0,84400,87280,club in england during that whole time
8hmCKXLaHk0,87280,89200,but bruce buck had an impact off the
8hmCKXLaHk0,89200,90880,pitch as well it wasn't just about the
8hmCKXLaHk0,90880,93119,football and the trophies it was also
8hmCKXLaHk0,93119,94560,all the work that chelsea did in the
8hmCKXLaHk0,94560,96880,community the work they did combating
8hmCKXLaHk0,96880,98880,racism the work they did during the
8hmCKXLaHk0,98880,100720,pandemic the work they've done when it
8hmCKXLaHk0,100720,103200,comes to anti-semitism and i've been
8hmCKXLaHk0,103200,104960,told that going forward he will still be
8hmCKXLaHk0,104960,106560,part of the chelsea family he'll always
8hmCKXLaHk0,106560,108960,be welcome at stamford bridge and he's
8hmCKXLaHk0,108960,111119,also there as a sounding board as a
8hmCKXLaHk0,111119,113759,senior advisor if anybody at chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,113759,116960,needs any advice he will always be there
8hmCKXLaHk0,116960,118719,the other big development to look out
8hmCKXLaHk0,118719,121439,for in the next few days is what happens
8hmCKXLaHk0,121439,124320,to marina graf skyer again we reported
8hmCKXLaHk0,124320,126719,in march that she was likely to leave
8hmCKXLaHk0,126719,129840,once roman abramovich sold the club and
8hmCKXLaHk0,129840,132080,that hasn't been confirmed yet but i
8hmCKXLaHk0,132080,134160,think we will be getting a statement
8hmCKXLaHk0,134160,136400,about her future in the next few days
8hmCKXLaHk0,136400,137200,from
8hmCKXLaHk0,137200,139440,chelsea daily telegraph
8hmCKXLaHk0,139440,141360,matt law their chelsea reporter
8hmCKXLaHk0,141360,143440,excellent contacts at stanford bridge
8hmCKXLaHk0,143440,146000,he's already reporting today that he
8hmCKXLaHk0,146000,148000,believes that marina garofska is going
8hmCKXLaHk0,148000,149920,to leave now obviously that is very
8hmCKXLaHk0,149920,151120,significant as far as chelsea is
8hmCKXLaHk0,151120,153440,concerned because she's effectively been
8hmCKXLaHk0,153440,156080,running chelsea on roman ramirez's
8hmCKXLaHk0,156080,157840,behalf
8hmCKXLaHk0,157840,160560,and she's been in charge of all the
8hmCKXLaHk0,160560,163200,transfer business so i think the
8hmCKXLaHk0,163200,165599,transfer business if she is to leave
8hmCKXLaHk0,165599,168239,that will be controlled by todd burley
8hmCKXLaHk0,168239,170400,and we've also seen that he's been more
8hmCKXLaHk0,170400,172080,involved in transfers this summer
8hmCKXLaHk0,172080,173200,especially
8hmCKXLaHk0,173200,176640,romelu lukaku's possible likely move to
8hmCKXLaHk0,176640,179440,inter milan so all change at chelsea but
8hmCKXLaHk0,179440,181360,of course this has been on the cards
8hmCKXLaHk0,181360,183760,because roman ramirez has sold the club
8hmCKXLaHk0,183760,186319,new owners have come in and they want to
8hmCKXLaHk0,186319,188959,have new people running the club
8hmCKXLaHk0,188959,190400,potentially new people on the pitch as
8hmCKXLaHk0,190400,191920,well come the starter next season and
8hmCKXLaHk0,191920,193840,it's looking increasingly likely i guess
8hmCKXLaHk0,193840,196879,that romelu lukaku won't be there
8hmCKXLaHk0,196879,198879,why is this much heralded much reported
8hmCKXLaHk0,198879,202239,transfer 97.5 million pounds been i
8hmCKXLaHk0,202239,203360,don't think there's any other word for
8hmCKXLaHk0,203360,205440,it but a failure
8hmCKXLaHk0,205440,206640,you've got to say
8hmCKXLaHk0,206640,208720,his heart hasn't been in it do you not
8hmCKXLaHk0,208720,210560,think ever i don't think his heart has
8hmCKXLaHk0,210560,211519,been
8hmCKXLaHk0,211519,213440,in playing for chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,213440,216239,last summer he said moving to chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,216239,218400,was his dream move they're the club that
8hmCKXLaHk0,218400,220319,he supported when he was a kid he had
8hmCKXLaHk0,220319,222799,unfinished business at chelsea they were
8hmCKXLaHk0,222799,224640,the only club he would leave into milan
8hmCKXLaHk0,224640,225440,for
8hmCKXLaHk0,225440,227200,within a few months of being at stanford
8hmCKXLaHk0,227200,228959,bridge he was giving an interview to sky
8hmCKXLaHk0,228959,231760,italy saying i don't like it here i want
8hmCKXLaHk0,231760,234480,to go back to inter
8hmCKXLaHk0,234480,236400,that's where my heart is i have a
8hmCKXLaHk0,236400,238560,special connection with the fans and you
8hmCKXLaHk0,238560,240879,have to say it has been one of the worst
8hmCKXLaHk0,240879,244560,transfers of all time chelsea played
8hmCKXLaHk0,244560,247200,almost 100 million pounds for him and
8hmCKXLaHk0,247200,249920,just 12 months later he effectively has
8hmCKXLaHk0,249920,252319,no future whatsoever at the club he's
8hmCKXLaHk0,252319,254000,going to be going back to into milan i
8hmCKXLaHk0,254000,255439,think intel will have to pay something
8hmCKXLaHk0,255439,257840,like 10 million pound loan fee to take
8hmCKXLaHk0,257840,259280,him back they're going to have to be
8hmCKXLaHk0,259280,261919,talks about who's going to pay his 325
8hmCKXLaHk0,261919,264400,000 pounds a week wages
8hmCKXLaHk0,264400,266400,but speaking to some people involved in
8hmCKXLaHk0,266400,268560,the negotiations involved in the deal
8hmCKXLaHk0,268560,270720,and they're telling me
8hmCKXLaHk0,270720,273120,lukaku's basically thrown in the tower
8hmCKXLaHk0,273120,276000,he's going back to his comfort zone he's
8hmCKXLaHk0,276000,277919,going back to
8hmCKXLaHk0,277919,279759,inter where he knows he's going to score
8hmCKXLaHk0,279759,282639,lots of goals and the fans well they
8hmCKXLaHk0,282639,283680,loved him i don't know if they're going
8hmCKXLaHk0,283680,285520,to love him going forward after what he
8hmCKXLaHk0,285520,288560,said and did last summer but really one
8hmCKXLaHk0,288560,290080,of the worst transfers of all time i
8hmCKXLaHk0,290080,290960,think
8hmCKXLaHk0,290960,293440,vast majority of chelsea supporters will
8hmCKXLaHk0,293440,295600,now be saying just
8hmCKXLaHk0,295600,296720,just
8hmCKXLaHk0,296720,299520,just go go back to inter it hasn't
8hmCKXLaHk0,299520,301919,worked out your heart's not in it let's
8hmCKXLaHk0,301919,304160,move on let's bring in some players who
8hmCKXLaHk0,304160,305759,actually want to play for chelsea and
8hmCKXLaHk0,305759,308080,they're up for the challenge i think
8hmCKXLaHk0,308080,309600,just picking up what you're saying kaveh
8hmCKXLaHk0,309600,311759,romelu lukaku has come under a great
8hmCKXLaHk0,311759,313280,deal of criticism
8hmCKXLaHk0,313280,315600,over this season over this move
8hmCKXLaHk0,315600,317520,but this is the romelu lukaku was
8hmCKXLaHk0,317520,319919,prolific for west brom for everton for
8hmCKXLaHk0,319919,322840,inter milan he's belgium's record
8hmCKXLaHk0,322840,325360,goalscorer so
8hmCKXLaHk0,325360,327039,two clubs in manchester united and
8hmCKXLaHk0,327039,329120,chelsea decided that they were going to
8hmCKXLaHk0,329120,331280,spend 90 million and 97 and a half
8hmCKXLaHk0,331280,333600,million pounds respectively to buy him
8hmCKXLaHk0,333600,334400,now
8hmCKXLaHk0,334400,337440,if you do that i get that the player is
8hmCKXLaHk0,337440,339440,going to have to adapt to the style of
8hmCKXLaHk0,339440,341360,play that manchester united and chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,341360,342160,have
8hmCKXLaHk0,342160,343520,but surely there's got to be a
8hmCKXLaHk0,343520,345520,compromise where
8hmCKXLaHk0,345520,347199,the club have to adapt to the way that
8hmCKXLaHk0,347199,349840,romelu lukaku plays because effectively
8hmCKXLaHk0,349840,352639,they're buying a player who was prolific
8hmCKXLaHk0,352639,355120,for all these clubs and his country
8hmCKXLaHk0,355120,356639,and yet they want him to play in a
8hmCKXLaHk0,356639,359199,completely different way so i'm just
8hmCKXLaHk0,359199,361919,wondering whether all of the criticism
8hmCKXLaHk0,361919,364800,and he is due some i get that if you ask
8hmCKXLaHk0,364800,366960,romelu lukaku and he was honest about it
8hmCKXLaHk0,366960,368720,has he performed as he should have done
8hmCKXLaHk0,368720,370000,particularly in the second season at
8hmCKXLaHk0,370000,371840,manchester united in his season at
8hmCKXLaHk0,371840,373280,chelsea last season he would probably
8hmCKXLaHk0,373280,375280,say no i didn't perform as i should have
8hmCKXLaHk0,375280,377919,done but did manchester united and
8hmCKXLaHk0,377919,381520,chelsea do enough for romelu lukaku so
8hmCKXLaHk0,381520,383919,that he can perform and he could perform
8hmCKXLaHk0,383919,385840,like he did for west brom for everton
8hmCKXLaHk0,385840,388560,for inter for belgium that is a question
8hmCKXLaHk0,388560,389759,i think that does need arsenal because
8hmCKXLaHk0,389759,392400,it's very easy just to say romelu lukaku
8hmCKXLaHk0,392400,395120,has been a failure but
8hmCKXLaHk0,395120,396960,i think you have to ask the question
8hmCKXLaHk0,396960,399280,whether the clubs have failed him as
8hmCKXLaHk0,399280,401440,well well that was a gormless sir i was
8hmCKXLaHk0,401440,402720,also going to say i think it's very
8hmCKXLaHk0,402720,404720,unfair to say his heart wasn't in it
8hmCKXLaHk0,404720,406479,from the start because
8hmCKXLaHk0,406479,408639,i spoke to lukaku
8hmCKXLaHk0,408639,410560,you know the introductory phase of his
8hmCKXLaHk0,410560,411919,return to
8hmCKXLaHk0,411919,414319,chelsea and he was so determined to come
8hmCKXLaHk0,414319,416240,back to the premier league prove a point
8hmCKXLaHk0,416240,418400,show people how much his game had
8hmCKXLaHk0,418400,419440,evolved
8hmCKXLaHk0,419440,422080,the training regime he had under antonio
8hmCKXLaHk0,422080,423680,conte he said
8hmCKXLaHk0,423680,426880,just revitalized him everything about
8hmCKXLaHk0,426880,428960,how he plays with his back to goal the
8hmCKXLaHk0,428960,431919,link-up play he was so motivated and so
8hmCKXLaHk0,431919,435199,inspired and was really told that
8hmCKXLaHk0,435199,437440,chelsea's issue was they could not bank
8hmCKXLaHk0,437440,439520,on a guaranteed goal scorer and he was
8hmCKXLaHk0,439520,441360,that that is what they were buying and
8hmCKXLaHk0,441360,443120,they'd invested so heavily in him
8hmCKXLaHk0,443120,444880,because they believed in him and then as
8hmCKXLaHk0,444880,446240,dharmesh said
8hmCKXLaHk0,446240,448400,what was the plan to actually
8hmCKXLaHk0,448400,450880,mesh his attributes with what they
8hmCKXLaHk0,450880,453360,already had and when you think of top
8hmCKXLaHk0,453360,456800,teams they do like that variety amongst
8hmCKXLaHk0,456800,458960,their forward line and and their attack
8hmCKXLaHk0,458960,462240,in general and i just think that they
8hmCKXLaHk0,462240,464160,they didn't do enough to get the best
8hmCKXLaHk0,464160,467039,out of him and probably that frustrated
8hmCKXLaHk0,467039,470720,him too quickly and i think both parties
8hmCKXLaHk0,470720,472479,are at fault i don't think you can you
8hmCKXLaHk0,472479,475840,can pin it on just one or the other
8hmCKXLaHk0,475840,477120,chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,477120,479199,got in there with the intention of
8hmCKXLaHk0,479199,481360,getting the best out of him but if we're
8hmCKXLaHk0,481360,483919,all being honest there was no mythology
8hmCKXLaHk0,483919,485440,to actually do that and that would be
8hmCKXLaHk0,485440,486400,the question i want to come back to in a
8hmCKXLaHk0,486400,489680,moment on who might replace lukaku but
8hmCKXLaHk0,489680,491440,you talking about that what other clubs
8hmCKXLaHk0,491440,493039,and who is responsible do you think
8hmCKXLaHk0,493039,495280,ultimately for bringing him to chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,495280,497039,i.e do you think that thomas took or
8hmCKXLaHk0,497039,498960,went to granovskaya last year at any
8hmCKXLaHk0,498960,500639,point in the summer and said this is who
8hmCKXLaHk0,500639,502479,i desperately want
8hmCKXLaHk0,502479,504400,or was tuckel just sort of lumbered with
8hmCKXLaHk0,504400,506000,him and said we'll try and make this
8hmCKXLaHk0,506000,508080,work i think i think chelsea wanted to
8hmCKXLaHk0,508080,510720,sign a striker last summer uh there was
8hmCKXLaHk0,510720,512800,lukaku there was harry kane there was
8hmCKXLaHk0,512800,514479,lewandowski
8hmCKXLaHk0,514479,518000,there was harland and chelsea supporters
8hmCKXLaHk0,518000,520320,weren't celebrating they weren't dancing
8hmCKXLaHk0,520320,522000,down the fulham road because they signed
8hmCKXLaHk0,522000,523440,lukaku
8hmCKXLaHk0,523440,525440,they'd seen what had happened
8hmCKXLaHk0,525440,528000,with lukaku at manchester united
8hmCKXLaHk0,528000,530640,before as well so
8hmCKXLaHk0,530640,532399,you know great things were expected of
8hmCKXLaHk0,532399,535200,him he hasn't delivered his heart hasn't
8hmCKXLaHk0,535200,537839,been in it he hasn't got his head down
8hmCKXLaHk0,537839,539120,and worked
8hmCKXLaHk0,539120,541440,he's basically saying the way thomas
8hmCKXLaHk0,541440,544560,tucker plays doesn't suit me you know
8hmCKXLaHk0,544560,546240,they should change the way they play to
8hmCKXLaHk0,546240,548399,bring the best out of me we should play
8hmCKXLaHk0,548399,550640,the way into milan played we should uh
8hmCKXLaHk0,550640,553519,you know that suits me more well chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,553519,555279,are not going to change their style of
8hmCKXLaHk0,555279,557360,play just to suit
8hmCKXLaHk0,557360,560839,one player just to suit romelu lukaku he
8hmCKXLaHk0,560839,562399,he
8hmCKXLaHk0,562399,564800,then it's absolute wastage if you have
8hmCKXLaHk0,564800,566480,no
8hmCKXLaHk0,566480,570399,no desire or no want to mesh his
8hmCKXLaHk0,570399,573200,attributes with what they currently have
8hmCKXLaHk0,573200,577800,why would you spend all that because
8hmCKXLaHk0,579600,580959,it's bad business but because they
8hmCKXLaHk0,580959,582399,didn't realize that he was going to be
8hmCKXLaHk0,582399,583920,somebody who was going to refuse to
8hmCKXLaHk0,583920,586560,change who was not going to who he
8hmCKXLaHk0,586560,587360,wasn't
8hmCKXLaHk0,587360,591279,money on a pedigreed striker who we all
8hmCKXLaHk0,591279,594080,know what his strengths are to then want
8hmCKXLaHk0,594080,596480,him to change you can't spend a hundred
8hmCKXLaHk0,596480,598320,million pounds or just shy of a hundred
8hmCKXLaHk0,598320,600320,million pounds on a player and then
8hmCKXLaHk0,600320,602000,suddenly expect but he wants to he's
8hmCKXLaHk0,602000,604800,eight he wants his pedigree to become a
8hmCKXLaHk0,604800,606480,completely different one you don't
8hmCKXLaHk0,606480,607920,expect to become a completely different
8hmCKXLaHk0,607920,609600,player they're expecting him to be a
8hmCKXLaHk0,609600,612079,team player to realize that it's not all
8hmCKXLaHk0,612079,614000,just about him and they weren't
8hmCKXLaHk0,614000,615839,expecting him after three months to
8hmCKXLaHk0,615839,618079,start giving interviews saying i want to
8hmCKXLaHk0,618079,620079,go back to into milan
8hmCKXLaHk0,620079,622800,if any other player had done that
8hmCKXLaHk0,622800,624640,they would have been treated the same
8hmCKXLaHk0,624640,626560,way as chelsea have treated romelu
8hmCKXLaHk0,626560,629440,lukaku they try they try to proportion
8hmCKXLaHk0,629440,631279,though him just showing affection for a
8hmCKXLaHk0,631279,633200,former club
8hmCKXLaHk0,633200,634160,look back
8hmCKXLaHk0,634160,635279,hold that thought hold that thought
8hmCKXLaHk0,635279,637040,because we want to come on to who might
8hmCKXLaHk0,637040,638720,come in and how things are developing at
8hmCKXLaHk0,638720,639760,chelsea
8hmCKXLaHk0,639760,641279,could ryan sterling be the replacement
8hmCKXLaHk0,641279,643839,in terms of a chelsea forward he is one
8hmCKXLaHk0,643839,646880,of chelsea's primary targets the issue
8hmCKXLaHk0,646880,649519,is chelsea have needed lukaku to move on
8hmCKXLaHk0,649519,651279,i think before they can
8hmCKXLaHk0,651279,654560,solidify what their plans for the attack
8hmCKXLaHk0,654560,657279,is they have not made any contact with
8hmCKXLaHk0,657279,659920,manchester city yet so any talk of a bit
8hmCKXLaHk0,659920,661200,already being
8hmCKXLaHk0,661200,664000,tabled is is not true
8hmCKXLaHk0,664000,666399,they haven't really actually had any
8hmCKXLaHk0,666399,668480,deep discussions with sterling yet now
8hmCKXLaHk0,668480,670480,he is
8hmCKXLaHk0,670480,672880,handling all the meetings on his own
8hmCKXLaHk0,672880,675200,with the talks with manchester city he's
8hmCKXLaHk0,675200,677680,doing it himself same with any potential
8hmCKXLaHk0,677680,678800,suitors
8hmCKXLaHk0,678800,681600,and ultimately for him he wants to be
8hmCKXLaHk0,681600,684640,guaranteed greater minutes and also
8hmCKXLaHk0,684640,687200,significance and responsibility he wants
8hmCKXLaHk0,687200,689279,to feel like he's making a tangible
8hmCKXLaHk0,689279,691680,contribution to the club he's at on and
8hmCKXLaHk0,691680,694399,off the pitch now we know for city his
8hmCKXLaHk0,694399,696880,status has receded he
8hmCKXLaHk0,696880,698399,doesn't make the starting lineup for the
8hmCKXLaHk0,698399,700320,biggest matches
8hmCKXLaHk0,700320,702320,and if he leaves a winning machine like
8hmCKXLaHk0,702320,704720,city in search of minutes he wants to be
8hmCKXLaHk0,704720,706640,assured guaranteed that he's going to
8hmCKXLaHk0,706640,708959,get it that is going to be a big force
8hmCKXLaHk0,708959,710320,somewhere else
8hmCKXLaHk0,710320,712320,and because chelsea haven't really had
8hmCKXLaHk0,712320,714480,those formal discussions yet he can't
8hmCKXLaHk0,714480,716240,ponder a move there because there's
8hmCKXLaHk0,716240,718320,nothing to ponder before it becomes like
8hmCKXLaHk0,718320,721540,formalized and official
