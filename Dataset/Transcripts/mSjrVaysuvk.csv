mSjrVaysuvk,480,3679,anybody in need of 40 black pens how
mSjrVaysuvk,3679,7759,about a bundle of 21 heavy duty sponges
mSjrVaysuvk,7759,10000,and what household would be complete
mSjrVaysuvk,10000,12240,without a large jar filled with three
mSjrVaysuvk,12240,14240,and a half pounds of chocolate covered
mSjrVaysuvk,14240,16000,raisins these are just some of the
mSjrVaysuvk,16000,18400,offerings available to you at costco the
mSjrVaysuvk,18400,20240,pay-to-enter wholesale store known for
mSjrVaysuvk,20240,22720,selling things in large quantities or at
mSjrVaysuvk,22720,25279,least in large packaging costco seems
mSjrVaysuvk,25279,27279,like a great store for large families
mSjrVaysuvk,27279,29199,but if you're only feeding a household
mSjrVaysuvk,29199,31279,of two it can be a bit challenging to
mSjrVaysuvk,31279,33120,shop at because a lot of the stuff only
mSjrVaysuvk,33120,35520,comes in very large portions especially
mSjrVaysuvk,35520,37760,when it comes to the food rest assured
mSjrVaysuvk,37760,40320,though they do sell toilets individually
mSjrVaysuvk,40320,42559,you do not have to buy a pack of 10
mSjrVaysuvk,42559,44879,toilets if you'd like to buy a toilet at
mSjrVaysuvk,44879,46640,costco
mSjrVaysuvk,46640,48879,so for this video i bought five
mSjrVaysuvk,48879,51280,different foods to try most of which are
mSjrVaysuvk,51280,53039,frozen so that they'll actually keep
mSjrVaysuvk,53039,55120,long enough for me to realistically eat
mSjrVaysuvk,55120,57600,everything before it goes bad i have a
mSjrVaysuvk,57600,60320,new fancy fridge that has a fancy huge
mSjrVaysuvk,60320,62239,freezer and it has been rendered
mSjrVaysuvk,62239,64878,temporarily unusable because it is
mSjrVaysuvk,64878,67760,stuffed wall to wall with frozen costco
mSjrVaysuvk,67760,70760,foods
mSjrVaysuvk,73600,75200,two of the foods that i got are actually
mSjrVaysuvk,75200,77200,retail versions of foods that are sold
mSjrVaysuvk,77200,80080,at costco's infamous food court the hot
mSjrVaysuvk,80080,83040,dog and the chicken bake i have seen
mSjrVaysuvk,83040,85360,news articles written about the dollar
mSjrVaysuvk,85360,88159,fifty hot dog it's that popular so i did
mSjrVaysuvk,88159,89840,what any rational person in this
mSjrVaysuvk,89840,91759,situation would do and i bought a pack
mSjrVaysuvk,91759,94640,of 14 extra long wieners along with a
mSjrVaysuvk,94640,97680,pack of 18 giant hot dog buns that match
mSjrVaysuvk,97680,99840,the ones sold in the food court buying
mSjrVaysuvk,99840,102000,bread at costco feels like a terrible
mSjrVaysuvk,102000,104560,idea unless you have a very large family
mSjrVaysuvk,104560,106240,or are planning a
mSjrVaysuvk,106240,108640,bread festival of some type in the near
mSjrVaysuvk,108640,111640,future
mSjrVaysuvk,114000,115680,followed the recommended cooking method
mSjrVaysuvk,115680,117759,which was to boil the hot dogs but i
mSjrVaysuvk,117759,119520,also employed a couple of other
mSjrVaysuvk,119520,123438,innovative hot dog techniques
mSjrVaysuvk,124479,127360,this here is the trademark hot dog towel
mSjrVaysuvk,127360,129280,off an essential step in hot dog
mSjrVaysuvk,129280,131520,preparation as it helps keep the bun
mSjrVaysuvk,131520,134160,nice and dry instead of getting it soggy
mSjrVaysuvk,134160,136560,with wiener sweat you'll also notice me
mSjrVaysuvk,136560,139040,performing the wiener vacation in which
mSjrVaysuvk,139040,141200,i remove the hot dog from the bun
mSjrVaysuvk,141200,143920,between bites once again intending to
mSjrVaysuvk,143920,146640,preserve the dryness of the bread i just
mSjrVaysuvk,146640,148640,can't have wet bread okay
mSjrVaysuvk,148640,151360,can't have it big surprise but i
mSjrVaysuvk,151360,153120,actually think that the hot dogs are
mSjrVaysuvk,153120,156400,worth the hype normally fancy hot dogs
mSjrVaysuvk,156400,158560,aren't my thing but these are an
mSjrVaysuvk,158560,161840,exception plump juicy wieners just how i
mSjrVaysuvk,161840,164080,like them i also quite enjoy the
mSjrVaysuvk,164080,166560,oversized sandwich buns that pair with
mSjrVaysuvk,166560,168239,these hot dogs although they are
mSjrVaysuvk,168239,170720,extremely bready not too bready for my
mSjrVaysuvk,170720,173440,taste because i'm a real bread head but
mSjrVaysuvk,173440,175760,other less bready individuals might find
mSjrVaysuvk,175760,177519,themselves picking the bun apart a
mSjrVaysuvk,177519,179760,little
mSjrVaysuvk,180959,183280,the chicken bake just sounded weird so i
mSjrVaysuvk,183280,184879,had to get it i'd even look at what it
mSjrVaysuvk,184879,186800,was exactly before i got it i was just
mSjrVaysuvk,186800,189040,so repulsed by the name chicken bake
mSjrVaysuvk,189040,191280,that it was purchased on site the box
mSjrVaysuvk,191280,192720,claims that they're stuffed with chicken
mSjrVaysuvk,192720,196000,breast strips three cheeses smoky bacon
mSjrVaysuvk,196000,198720,caesar dressing and green onions which
mSjrVaysuvk,198720,201599,despite my initial fears actually sounds
mSjrVaysuvk,201599,202959,kind of good actually they look kind of
mSjrVaysuvk,202959,205959,good
mSjrVaysuvk,209800,219320,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,219840,221519,now these things were a pleasant
mSjrVaysuvk,221519,223680,surprise i've actually already almost
mSjrVaysuvk,223680,225840,finished off the entire box of chicken
mSjrVaysuvk,225840,227840,bakes at this point just because they're
mSjrVaysuvk,227840,232680,so tasty and convenient to make
mSjrVaysuvk,236590,241360,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,241360,242560,that is actually a lot better than i
mSjrVaysuvk,242560,244159,thought it was gonna be it's not at all
mSjrVaysuvk,244159,245200,what i thought it was gonna be i thought
mSjrVaysuvk,245200,247040,it was gonna be like a pizza pocket i
mSjrVaysuvk,247040,249680,know it doesn't have gravy
mSjrVaysuvk,249680,251280,it kind of reminds me of a chicken pot
mSjrVaysuvk,251280,252239,pie
mSjrVaysuvk,252239,254480,the chicken in particular is really
mSjrVaysuvk,254480,256479,tender tasty i'm not sure that i'll be
mSjrVaysuvk,256479,258639,buying another box of these once i'm
mSjrVaysuvk,258639,261519,done for they do contain a large number
mSjrVaysuvk,261519,263919,of chicken bakes but for now i'm just
mSjrVaysuvk,263919,266240,kind of enjoying the ride next thing
mSjrVaysuvk,266240,268400,next thing
mSjrVaysuvk,268400,271040,next thing
mSjrVaysuvk,274840,278160,it's the kirkland signature pepperoni
mSjrVaysuvk,278160,281040,pizza sold in packages of four it's the
mSjrVaysuvk,281040,283840,perfect pepperoni pizza for pepperoni
mSjrVaysuvk,283840,287440,pizza lovers that need a box full of
mSjrVaysuvk,287440,290560,marinara sauce
mSjrVaysuvk,290660,292960,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,292960,294400,oh yeah by the way
mSjrVaysuvk,294400,296560,kirkland's signature is costco's
mSjrVaysuvk,296560,299040,in-house brand so whenever you see this
mSjrVaysuvk,299040,301199,logo you know that it's a costco
mSjrVaysuvk,301199,302479,production i always thought that the
mSjrVaysuvk,302479,304800,logo looked like a battery logo so i
mSjrVaysuvk,304800,307360,don't exactly love seeing it on food
mSjrVaysuvk,307360,309440,packaging but you know
mSjrVaysuvk,309440,311919,somehow i think i'll get by
mSjrVaysuvk,311919,313840,out of everything i bought for the video
mSjrVaysuvk,313840,316240,the pizzas are the one that i regret the
mSjrVaysuvk,316240,318639,most in retrospect not because it's a
mSjrVaysuvk,318639,320800,bad pizza because it's definitely above
mSjrVaysuvk,320800,323039,average the problem is that even an
mSjrVaysuvk,323039,326080,above average frozen pizza is still a
mSjrVaysuvk,326080,328800,frozen pizza and i'm just not that big
mSjrVaysuvk,328800,331440,of a fan
mSjrVaysuvk,332960,335520,the ronies are rocking the sauce isn't
mSjrVaysuvk,335520,338400,too soupy and it features a thin crispy
mSjrVaysuvk,338400,339759,crust
mSjrVaysuvk,339759,342400,but man is just so far and away from an
mSjrVaysuvk,342400,345039,actual pizza that it's practically a
mSjrVaysuvk,345039,346990,different food
mSjrVaysuvk,346990,348160,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,348160,350000,i enjoyed it though like i said it is
mSjrVaysuvk,350000,352720,above average if you like a frozen pizza
mSjrVaysuvk,352720,354639,and you like them in bulk
mSjrVaysuvk,354639,356880,you might enjoy these pizzas i think
mSjrVaysuvk,356880,358479,that the three that i have left over are
mSjrVaysuvk,358479,360319,just going to be sitting in my freezer
mSjrVaysuvk,360319,361840,for a while i'm going to have to use
mSjrVaysuvk,361840,363360,them as
mSjrVaysuvk,363360,365039,midnight snacks or something i don't
mSjrVaysuvk,365039,368919,know what i'm gonna do with this
mSjrVaysuvk,377580,393280,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,393280,396080,different day different pants different
mSjrVaysuvk,396080,398720,black shirt i had to film these two
mSjrVaysuvk,398720,400720,segments separately because i filled up
mSjrVaysuvk,400720,402960,on all of the frozen stuff the first day
mSjrVaysuvk,402960,404800,i actually ate over half of that frozen
mSjrVaysuvk,404800,406400,pizza that i just got finished saying
mSjrVaysuvk,406400,408800,that i didn't like
mSjrVaysuvk,408800,410319,the last two things i got for this video
mSjrVaysuvk,410319,412560,are the ling ling chicken and veggie pot
mSjrVaysuvk,412560,415280,stickers and the orange chicken
mSjrVaysuvk,415280,417919,which was made by
mSjrVaysuvk,417919,421199,it was like a crazy kitchen or something
mSjrVaysuvk,421199,423120,like that crazy question
mSjrVaysuvk,423120,425280,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,425280,426479,okay well they're gonna know that i
mSjrVaysuvk,426479,428240,already had some of these
mSjrVaysuvk,428240,429840,this was not the first time i tried the
mSjrVaysuvk,429840,431680,pot stickers the first time i tried them
mSjrVaysuvk,431680,433440,i actually didn't really care for them
mSjrVaysuvk,433440,436240,which is a shame because i bought a huge
mSjrVaysuvk,436240,438560,four pound bag of them but i needed to
mSjrVaysuvk,438560,440960,get pot sticker cooking footage so i
mSjrVaysuvk,440960,443360,said you know what i'll strap on my
mSjrVaysuvk,443360,445759,bandana of open-mindedness and i'll give
mSjrVaysuvk,445759,447300,them another shot
mSjrVaysuvk,447300,459680,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,459680,462319,i'm not sure if the bandana was gripping
mSjrVaysuvk,462319,464400,my head too tightly or what but the
mSjrVaysuvk,464400,466560,second time around i really love these
mSjrVaysuvk,466560,468800,pot stickers it's almost like a little
mSjrVaysuvk,468800,470720,little meatball it feels like the
mSjrVaysuvk,470720,473520,perfect high quality snack or appetizer
mSjrVaysuvk,473520,476160,that requires a very minimal amount of
mSjrVaysuvk,476160,478479,effort i'm not sure that i need four
mSjrVaysuvk,478479,480080,pounds of them but since they aren't
mSjrVaysuvk,480080,481919,costco brand i'm assuming that you can
mSjrVaysuvk,481919,484000,buy these in other stores too most
mSjrVaysuvk,484000,485840,likely in a more reasonably sized
mSjrVaysuvk,485840,488240,package
mSjrVaysuvk,489039,492319,what are you doing in here
mSjrVaysuvk,492319,493640,where do you think you're going
mSjrVaysuvk,493640,500339,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,500879,502639,as for the orange chicken you know it
mSjrVaysuvk,502639,504319,sure was orange
mSjrVaysuvk,504319,509039,and it sure was chicken a lot of chicken
mSjrVaysuvk,509039,510800,copious meats
mSjrVaysuvk,510800,512959,the box comes with two separate servings
mSjrVaysuvk,512959,514719,so you only have to make half of it at
mSjrVaysuvk,514719,517200,one time but even then it's a lot of
mSjrVaysuvk,517200,519919,food probably enough food to feed four
mSjrVaysuvk,519919,522080,or five people maybe even more if you
mSjrVaysuvk,522080,523919,were to add some rice and veggies into
mSjrVaysuvk,523919,525040,the mix
mSjrVaysuvk,525040,527200,but it's also really tasty and the
mSjrVaysuvk,527200,529200,chicken was higher quality than i
mSjrVaysuvk,529200,531279,expected i'm not sure i can say that
mSjrVaysuvk,531279,533600,it's better than trader joe's orange
mSjrVaysuvk,533600,536160,chicken i mean trader joe is skimpy with
mSjrVaysuvk,536160,539040,his serving size but i really love that
mSjrVaysuvk,539040,542320,chicken this crazy quichen chicken is a
mSjrVaysuvk,542320,544480,pretty solid second choice though you
mSjrVaysuvk,544480,546720,know this could end up being my most
mSjrVaysuvk,546720,550160,positive brutal foods yet 100 i'm gonna
mSjrVaysuvk,550160,552160,be eating all of these again i've
mSjrVaysuvk,552160,553920,already almost finished off the chicken
mSjrVaysuvk,553920,556480,bakes and i'm eager for another oh chick
mSjrVaysuvk,556480,558720,and pot stick night
mSjrVaysuvk,558720,560800,it's the frozen pizza man the frozen
mSjrVaysuvk,560800,563440,pizza is the only one where i'm just not
mSjrVaysuvk,563440,565200,sure when i'm gonna eat it and again
mSjrVaysuvk,565200,567040,that's not because of quality i just
mSjrVaysuvk,567040,570160,really prefer actual pizza but you never
mSjrVaysuvk,570160,572240,know maybe i get a little late night
mSjrVaysuvk,572240,575279,sneaky snacky and i pop a frozen za in
mSjrVaysuvk,575279,578440,the yubby
mSjrVaysuvk,592399,595399,uh
mSjrVaysuvk,595550,603750,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,603750,605810,[Applause]
mSjrVaysuvk,605810,611279,[Music]
mSjrVaysuvk,611279,614160,the biggest potential downside to costco
mSjrVaysuvk,614160,616640,foods is clearly the portion sizes that
mSjrVaysuvk,616640,618800,you're forced to purchase i realize that
mSjrVaysuvk,618800,621360,for some that's the entire reason to go
mSjrVaysuvk,621360,623839,to the store but for me i definitely
mSjrVaysuvk,623839,626000,wish i could downsize some of this stuff
mSjrVaysuvk,626000,628160,it's gonna be a little while until i
mSjrVaysuvk,628160,630320,have any extra space in my freezer
mSjrVaysuvk,630320,633040,because the costco frozen foods are
mSjrVaysuvk,633040,636160,large and very much in charge
mSjrVaysuvk,636160,638240,costco as a whole
mSjrVaysuvk,638240,640320,pretty great store it's a really fun
mSjrVaysuvk,640320,643040,place to browse they hand out food
mSjrVaysuvk,643040,645200,samples all over the place and they do
mSjrVaysuvk,645200,647680,have some good deals on items that most
mSjrVaysuvk,647680,650160,households could stock up on if you're a
mSjrVaysuvk,650160,652399,smaller household though you might also
mSjrVaysuvk,652399,654399,end up having to go to a regular grocery
mSjrVaysuvk,654399,656320,store for some things unless you really
mSjrVaysuvk,656320,658560,think you're gonna get through 18 hot
mSjrVaysuvk,658560,661279,dog buns before they go moldy
mSjrVaysuvk,661279,663120,it's a challenge it's a really big
mSjrVaysuvk,663120,665519,challenge but you know it's another
mSjrVaysuvk,665519,668000,possibly more convenient way to feed
mSjrVaysuvk,668000,670399,your small household rather than running
mSjrVaysuvk,670399,672560,around to five different grocery stores
mSjrVaysuvk,672560,676480,it's today's video spa
mSjrVaysuvk,676480,679040,hi i'm freshy and this video is

mSjrVaysuvk,684320,687680,might be biased but i'm a real big fan
mSjrVaysuvk,687680,689760,hello fresh delivers fresh quality
