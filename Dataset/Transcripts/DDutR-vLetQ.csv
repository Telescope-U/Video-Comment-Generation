DDutR-vLetQ,13809,21280,reduce stress and by the way that this  same process is  exactly the same process that allows you
DDutR-vLetQ,21280,27430,to have a long term balanced career  sometimes people say
DDutR-vLetQ,27430,34930,ok i will do this but it will be hard it will cost  a lot of money it will take time or whatever  if i quit smoking you know i would gain some
DDutR-vLetQ,34930,41440,weight maybe or go back to school and  get my degree but it would take ten

DDutR-vLetQ,46930,52120,go back to school and what about the  degree but instead what you need
DDutR-vLetQ,52120,57149,to do to set your goal is define  the benefits because I want to do this
DDutR-vLetQ,57149,63780,identify the obstacles you need to  overcome detail the  necessary skills and knowledge
DDutR-vLetQ,63780,73840,"identify the people, groups and  organizations with whom you make an  action plan and set a date"
DDutR-vLetQ,73840,80050,if you want to build an act winning attitude  you have to take some time that  may surprise you based on what I've
DDutR-vLetQ,80050,86680,said so far  but you have to take some quiet time  you have to do it at least four or
DDutR-vLetQ,86680,92979,five times a week many will say  this guy keeps talking about time for  this and that I don't have time for
DDutR-vLetQ,92979,98670,all that I'll tell you that apart from that it's three  extra hours every day of your life
DDutR-vLetQ,98670,103800,guaranteed  more than 70% of all the time you spend
DDutR-vLetQ,103800,110090,watching television you see things you  're not interested in seeing
DDutR-vLetQ,110090,117390,I'd like you to be encouraged to do this give a  slow pace aimlessly and absolutely
DDutR-vLetQ,117390,124070,meaningless  the key to generating wealth is not  when you work you can't just work
DDutR-vLetQ,124070,131330,you have to invest your way  people who aren't rich is because they don't  own anything they just have their
DDutR-vLetQ,131330,136730,cash and if their money is like that realistically they  get poorer
DDutR-vLetQ,136730,143330,daily some really fear  success success doesn't just come ok but
DDutR-vLetQ,143330,150019,until you get past that average reality  you live in no matter where you are  once you feel comfortable you won't be
DDutR-vLetQ,150020,156940,average anyone can live like this  anyone can live mediocrity  but if you have outliers
DDutR-vLetQ,156940,162879,it will constantly push you to  the next level  knowledge is what influences
DDutR-vLetQ,162879,169670,life  it's not about how strong you are it's about  what you can learn and then how to
DDutR-vLetQ,169670,176150,actively apply it  millionaire people stopped exchanging  time for money they started making
DDutR-vLetQ,176150,183830,their money work for them and they value  people as much as they can the  caveat is that we have  gone very little into that the reason
DDutR-vLetQ,183830,190159,you give so much value to  people is because if you give it to them they will never  leave you they will always be there for you and you will
DDutR-vLetQ,190160,197769,never need anything as long as you give  that value to people  millionaires first look for shares
DDutR-vLetQ,197769,204590,they start the business and then they get  goods as long as you believe in it the  only thing that what matters is that you think you
DDutR-vLetQ,204590,210290,can do it  personally i think there is nothing they  can't do and for me it's about
DDutR-vLetQ,210290,217459,compliance of the purpose the impact  as if the money were their product of  others that is not my focus my
DDutR-vLetQ,217459,224599,focus is that I have the knowledge and  information with which  life can be changed not only unite our
DDutR-vLetQ,224599,229970,lives  so the way they are changed lives  is learning to find new
DDutR-vLetQ,229970,237069,ways to spread that information being  able to open up about being vulnerable  because we all need to connect
DDutR-vLetQ,237070,242090,so for me it's always about how  to achieve something it's always my challenge how
DDutR-vLetQ,242090,247190,can I gain more knowledge because  I love to learn I love to learn but
DDutR-vLetQ,247190,252740,how can I take that and be able to  correspond to it or give it to someone who
DDutR-vLetQ,252740,260660,doesn't understand things like  trigonometry calculus but if I can give it that  way maybe they'll say or if I finally understood
DDutR-vLetQ,260660,267230,there are many people who fought in the  world and became successful so  fighting has that being in a language
DDutR-vLetQ,267230,273949,that you know so that language is  excellent if I can break everything and change  to a fighting language I will make it possible for everyone to
DDutR-vLetQ,273950,280699,win that is the goal make the  game winnable for those who are  brave enough to dare to bat
DDutR-vLetQ,280700,286039,if they are brave i did if you are brave enough  to do it you will get an
DDutR-vLetQ,286040,293000,experience out of that and that is so  exhilarating it will take you to the next  level because now it will keep chasing
DDutR-vLetQ,293000,300350,next level is there when you understand  life with a very different concept  when you begin to understand I was
DDutR-vLetQ,300350,305570,for a long time living at a low  level I thought at a low level once
DDutR-vLetQ,305570,311360,you expose yourself it will make you responsible for it  and therefore once I expose myself to
DDutR-vLetQ,311360,316460,"knowledge and information once  I show it to you, you are already responsible"
DDutR-vLetQ,316460,325400,because you cannot say that you did not know the  best of all is that it cannot be great  if you do practices you do not reach 81
DDutR-vLetQ,325400,331060,healthy and you never go to the gym so go to the  gym and find someone who can teach you
