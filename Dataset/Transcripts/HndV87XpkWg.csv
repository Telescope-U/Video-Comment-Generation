HndV87XpkWg,1220,4100,Everyone agrees that education is hugely important
HndV87XpkWg,5440,8460,The thing is we're not particularly sure what we want from it
HndV87XpkWg,8860,11900,The aim of education should be to prepare us for the challenges of adult life
HndV87XpkWg,12900,18439,Yet from this perspective it's clear that schools fail all but for tiny portions of their students
HndV87XpkWg,18520,20820,Whether in highly academic private schools
HndV87XpkWg,20860,25400,Or in deprived government-run ones trouble-dealing with life's challenges
HndV87XpkWg,25400,27920,remains very wide spread indeed
HndV87XpkWg,30860,34940,"Human ingenuity, energy, goodwill, and talent"
HndV87XpkWg,34940,37860,is being lost on an industrial scale
HndV87XpkWg,37960,42020,to get more ambitious about education doesn't necessarily mean spending more money
HndV87XpkWg,42240,46340,"building more schools, employing more teachers or making exams more difficult"
HndV87XpkWg,47180,51340,"Rather, it should mean focusing more on the real purpose of education"
HndV87XpkWg,51740,56980,There are two fundamental tasks it should help us with: working and sustaining good relationships
HndV87XpkWg,58480,62720,In order to address these needs a future national curriculum might specify
HndV87XpkWg,62860,64780,that the following subjects be studied
HndV87XpkWg,64800,66800,"Firstly, capitalism"
HndV87XpkWg,67140,71120,A conspiracy of silence exists around the economic system we live within
HndV87XpkWg,71480,75020,We find it hard to change its bad sides or defend its strengths
HndV87XpkWg,75100,77840,because we simply don't fully understand how it works
HndV87XpkWg,78540,83840,A subject like maths should be geared to teach its number one utility for 99% of the population
HndV87XpkWg,84200,86479,dealing with money
HndV87XpkWg,88380,90979,Such classes would demistify the global economy
HndV87XpkWg,91140,95060,by teaching students the importance of the means of production and how profits are made
HndV87XpkWg,95940,100720,"The role of cashflow, HR leadership, marketing, and competition would also be studied"
HndV87XpkWg,101740,106439,In a perfect school system you'd also then study a really big second subject
HndV87XpkWg,106500,107600,yourself
HndV87XpkWg,108360,111240,Young students would be introduced to the idea that we humans
HndV87XpkWg,111280,113799,are extremely prone to misunderstanding ourselves
HndV87XpkWg,114760,118220,"They would be taken through the concepts of delusion, defensiveness"
HndV87XpkWg,118300,120740,projection and denial in everyday life
HndV87XpkWg,121560,125560,Individual tutors would be on hand to help students towards personality maps
HndV87XpkWg,125760,129220,with particular attention paid to their neurosis and fears
HndV87XpkWg,129899,131900,Doing this would ensure that students learn a lot
HndV87XpkWg,132160,134160,about how complex they truly are
HndV87XpkWg,134460,137040,and what types of people they would be best suited to hang out with
HndV87XpkWg,138160,141260,A crucial unit would be devoted to career self-knowledge
HndV87XpkWg,141760,143760,What job are you best suited to?
HndV87XpkWg,143960,145960,Students would spend three hours a week
HndV87XpkWg,146100,148100,exploring what they might do with their futures
HndV87XpkWg,149260,151260,Then we would sutdy relationships
HndV87XpkWg,151780,156360,Being intensely aware of the social and individual cost of every unhappy relationship
HndV87XpkWg,157000,159560,An ideal education system would emphasize
HndV87XpkWg,159560,161560,the acquisition of skills that help people
HndV87XpkWg,161560,163200,to live better together
HndV87XpkWg,163700,165700,There would be units on kindness and forgiveness
HndV87XpkWg,165700,167700,as well as on anxiety-reduction techniques
HndV87XpkWg,168940,172840,In this educational utopia it wouln't only be children who would go to school
HndV87XpkWg,172840,174340,but adults as well
HndV87XpkWg,175000,177000,Schooling would be for life
HndV87XpkWg,178240,181020,Education wouldn't just be taking place in classrooms
HndV87XpkWg,181140,184780,media and the arts would be made to maximize their teaching potential
HndV87XpkWg,185240,188320,and help to teach people what they actually need to learn
HndV87XpkWg,189780,193140,We're so hung up on the challenges of running a massive education system
HndV87XpkWg,193140,195980,we're failing to pinpoint the real source of its problems
HndV87XpkWg,196660,199580,"These are primarily about money, salaries or discipline"
HndV87XpkWg,200000,203280,These are only a consequence of a more fundamental problem
HndV87XpkWg,203620,206420,Right now and with no-one quite meaning for this to happen
HndV87XpkWg,206700,209340,we've simply got the wrong curriculum
