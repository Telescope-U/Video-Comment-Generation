hgVnEKSFSeA,80,2000,yo what's up guys my name is moon boy
hgVnEKSFSeA,2000,4900,and today we're making some tech houses
hgVnEKSFSeA,4900,12240,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,12240,13679,if you don't know what tech house is by
hgVnEKSFSeA,13679,15440,now it's basically a more minimal
hgVnEKSFSeA,15440,17840,version of house music it's basically
hgVnEKSFSeA,17840,19920,these three key elements we have a
hgVnEKSFSeA,19920,22800,simple drum beat
hgVnEKSFSeA,23039,26720,a groovy deep bass line
hgVnEKSFSeA,26720,29279,and a catchy repeatable vocal hook but
hgVnEKSFSeA,29279,31599,even that's optional sometimes with this
hgVnEKSFSeA,31599,33840,genre it's all about something catchy
hgVnEKSFSeA,33840,35680,and groovy you can just dance to some
hgVnEKSFSeA,35680,37360,very popular records right now that i'm
hgVnEKSFSeA,37360,38480,pretty sure you've heard through like
hgVnEKSFSeA,38480,40640,tick tock or a festival or even a house
hgVnEKSFSeA,40640,44330,party we have acres do it to it
hgVnEKSFSeA,44330,47420,[Applause]
hgVnEKSFSeA,48960,51039,this is one of my favorite styles of uh
hgVnEKSFSeA,51039,53120,tech house it's more of like finding a
hgVnEKSFSeA,53120,55680,very very catchy vocal and creating a
hgVnEKSFSeA,55680,57920,nice groove then we have fisher losing
hgVnEKSFSeA,57920,60079,it
hgVnEKSFSeA,62719,64720,this is a more heavier style of tech
hgVnEKSFSeA,64720,66479,house you can argue that it's just house
hgVnEKSFSeA,66479,68080,music uh but i still like to call it
hgVnEKSFSeA,68080,73080,tech house we also have diplo inside p's
hgVnEKSFSeA,74640,75920,now you guys can go through a rabbit
hgVnEKSFSeA,75920,77520,hole tech house and get to like the
hgVnEKSFSeA,77520,79759,super minimal and cool stuff like uh
hgVnEKSFSeA,79759,81600,michael bibby or bb i don't know how to
hgVnEKSFSeA,81600,83040,pronounce his name so today we're gonna
hgVnEKSFSeA,83040,84880,draw inspiration from the songs i just
hgVnEKSFSeA,84880,86479,mentioned and we're gonna make a tech
hgVnEKSFSeA,86479,89520,house hit step number one the drums now
hgVnEKSFSeA,89520,91200,the drums are incredibly important with
hgVnEKSFSeA,91200,92799,tech outs because of the very few
hgVnEKSFSeA,92799,95280,elements that are in sec house the drums
hgVnEKSFSeA,95280,96960,is one of the most emphasis you can have
hgVnEKSFSeA,96960,98640,it play after the whole track even so
hgVnEKSFSeA,98640,101040,tech house is typically around 120 to
hgVnEKSFSeA,101040,105200,128 bpm we're gonna be doing 125. now
hgVnEKSFSeA,105200,106880,i'm going to be using drum samples for
hgVnEKSFSeA,106880,108880,my new infiniti production suite to make
hgVnEKSFSeA,108880,110720,a house beat is very simple you put a
hgVnEKSFSeA,110720,114479,kick on every beat
hgVnEKSFSeA,114479,117840,a clap on every second beat
hgVnEKSFSeA,117840,121520,and a hat on the offbeat
hgVnEKSFSeA,124320,126079,now you can get fancy with the rhythm of
hgVnEKSFSeA,126079,127920,the hats you can add extra layer create
hgVnEKSFSeA,127920,130399,more rhythm
hgVnEKSFSeA,131280,132400,and you can even throw in some
hgVnEKSFSeA,132400,134959,percussion
hgVnEKSFSeA,138160,139599,now this is a perfect starting point to
hgVnEKSFSeA,139599,141280,making tech house now there's multiple
hgVnEKSFSeA,141280,142560,styles when it comes to tech house as
hgVnEKSFSeA,142560,144560,well i'll show you some other variations
hgVnEKSFSeA,144560,146800,and this is for my new infinity pack we
hgVnEKSFSeA,146800,148400,have the more traditional tech out style
hgVnEKSFSeA,148400,150080,where the drum loop is basically the
hgVnEKSFSeA,150080,150830,whole drop
hgVnEKSFSeA,150830,155360,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,155360,157120,then we have a more heavier style which
hgVnEKSFSeA,157120,160720,is kind of like chris like fisher style
hgVnEKSFSeA,164640,166800,then we have an even more minimal style
hgVnEKSFSeA,166800,170640,where it's like super super groovy
hgVnEKSFSeA,170640,174560,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,174560,175920,this is definitely like michael bibby
hgVnEKSFSeA,175920,178959,style step number two the vocal vibe
hgVnEKSFSeA,178959,181599,around the track we need a unique catchy
hgVnEKSFSeA,181599,184000,vocal hook to give the vibe of the whole
hgVnEKSFSeA,184000,186000,track now the most catchy vocals for
hgVnEKSFSeA,186000,189360,house music i believe is early 2000s r b
hgVnEKSFSeA,189360,191120,music that was just like a golden era
hgVnEKSFSeA,191120,192800,for like really dope hooks now if you
hgVnEKSFSeA,192800,194800,guys didn't know a lot of these big tech
hgVnEKSFSeA,194800,197920,house house records are sampling these
hgVnEKSFSeA,197920,200319,old r b classics they were just able to
hgVnEKSFSeA,200319,202000,clear the sample for example the
hgVnEKSFSeA,202000,206080,original sample to ah craze do it to
hgVnEKSFSeA,209010,210840,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,210840,214159,it the original sample to on my mind by
hgVnEKSFSeA,214159,215500,diplo inside piece
hgVnEKSFSeA,215500,222480,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,222480,224560,and the list just keeps going on and on
hgVnEKSFSeA,224560,226879,so basically the essence of house music
hgVnEKSFSeA,226879,229599,is just a really really good catchy idea
hgVnEKSFSeA,229599,231040,once you have that you're solid if
hgVnEKSFSeA,231040,232319,you're having trouble finding really
hgVnEKSFSeA,232319,234480,really good hooks and vocals what i
hgVnEKSFSeA,234480,236720,suggest is the producer mindset and what
hgVnEKSFSeA,236720,238879,the producer mindset is is your brain is
hgVnEKSFSeA,238879,240959,always on looking for sounds and samples
hgVnEKSFSeA,240959,242799,so no matter where you are if you listen
hgVnEKSFSeA,242799,244159,to something catchy you'll pick it up so
hgVnEKSFSeA,244159,245599,the other day i was driving in my car
hgVnEKSFSeA,245599,247599,and i was listening to like old hip hop
hgVnEKSFSeA,247599,249760,old r b um i just had it like on a
hgVnEKSFSeA,249760,251680,playlist you know and the song by ciara
hgVnEKSFSeA,251680,254080,and miss the iliad came on and when the
hgVnEKSFSeA,254080,258079,hook came on i was like oh my god
hgVnEKSFSeA,258230,261680,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,261680,263520,as soon as i heard that i was like oh yo
hgVnEKSFSeA,263520,265199,what the heck this is dope so we're
hgVnEKSFSeA,265199,266720,gonna go ahead and grab the acapella and
hgVnEKSFSeA,266720,268800,download it sometimes it's as simple as
hgVnEKSFSeA,268800,271600,just typing in the name and acapella
hgVnEKSFSeA,271600,273440,and then bam here it is
hgVnEKSFSeA,273440,275759,ladies and gentlemen
hgVnEKSFSeA,275759,277440,and then we just download it just as a
hgVnEKSFSeA,277440,279040,quick tip whenever it's not as easy as
hgVnEKSFSeA,279040,280320,this is just like finding it on the
hgVnEKSFSeA,280320,282880,internet um you can use like izotope rx
hgVnEKSFSeA,282880,284960,or you can search up on google acapella
hgVnEKSFSeA,284960,286800,generator and there's like so many
hgVnEKSFSeA,286800,291120,acapella extractors and here it is
hgVnEKSFSeA,292639,294880,as a bonus touch to change it up a bit
hgVnEKSFSeA,294880,297199,and even avoid copyright early on if
hgVnEKSFSeA,297199,298800,you're trying to like put it in a mix or
hgVnEKSFSeA,298800,301520,bootlegging it literally negative two or
hgVnEKSFSeA,301520,304160,three um semitones let's put it on
hgVnEKSFSeA,304160,308080,complex and then we got it
hgVnEKSFSeA,308080,310880,everybody get on the floor crank the
hgVnEKSFSeA,310880,313600,body up
hgVnEKSFSeA,313600,314880,like that's it right there like
hgVnEKSFSeA,314880,316320,literally everybody the whole crowd
hgVnEKSFSeA,316320,318320,would sing that this is like literally a
hgVnEKSFSeA,318320,320639,hit already step number three the bass
hgVnEKSFSeA,320639,323639,line
hgVnEKSFSeA,324960,327199,now this seems mad simple but the
hgVnEKSFSeA,327199,329759,complexity lies and how catchy you can
hgVnEKSFSeA,329759,332160,make a groovy melody that can be
hgVnEKSFSeA,332160,334479,repeated hundreds of times and not sound
hgVnEKSFSeA,334479,336560,too repetitive now for the baseline i'm
hgVnEKSFSeA,336560,338240,gonna use one of my presets from my
hgVnEKSFSeA,338240,340160,internal preset pack which is included
hgVnEKSFSeA,340160,342160,in my new production suite infiniti i
hgVnEKSFSeA,342160,344400,made this preset to be super effective
hgVnEKSFSeA,344400,347680,it's low and minimal
hgVnEKSFSeA,348240,350400,but it's still present in like the phone
hgVnEKSFSeA,350400,352560,or laptop speakers
hgVnEKSFSeA,352560,355199,so in order to achieve that effect i
hgVnEKSFSeA,355199,359440,added um a punchy pitch bend
hgVnEKSFSeA,359440,362479,and then i added um some harmonics on a
hgVnEKSFSeA,362479,364080,sine wave
hgVnEKSFSeA,364080,366240,so here we got the waveform and i added
hgVnEKSFSeA,366240,367330,some harmonics like this
hgVnEKSFSeA,367330,369120,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,369120,370720,otherwise it'll be like a very plain
hgVnEKSFSeA,370720,372880,sine wave
hgVnEKSFSeA,372880,375690,but then with some harmonics
hgVnEKSFSeA,375690,378000,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,378000,380000,that definitely makes a huge difference
hgVnEKSFSeA,380000,381680,now for the groove i'm going to draw
hgVnEKSFSeA,381680,383680,some inspiration from how people do
hgVnEKSFSeA,383680,385199,those funky bass lines so it's going to
hgVnEKSFSeA,385199,386530,be like something like this
hgVnEKSFSeA,386530,389759,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,389759,391039,we draw it in and it looks something
hgVnEKSFSeA,391039,394120,like this
hgVnEKSFSeA,394319,397360,added some swing to it
hgVnEKSFSeA,397360,399280,super vibey now if you guys have trouble
hgVnEKSFSeA,399280,401840,making grooves like this no worries i've
hgVnEKSFSeA,401840,405440,made a ton of pre-made midis and bass
hgVnEKSFSeA,405440,407039,loops um that you can quickly like drag
hgVnEKSFSeA,407039,408880,and drop just to get some ideas flowing
hgVnEKSFSeA,408880,410319,it's gonna be in my new infinity
hgVnEKSFSeA,410319,411759,production suite you can learn more
hgVnEKSFSeA,411759,413280,about that in the description so with
hgVnEKSFSeA,413280,415120,this here i think we're pretty good with
hgVnEKSFSeA,415120,417039,the main baseline we don't need to do
hgVnEKSFSeA,417039,419520,anything more
hgVnEKSFSeA,420840,423199,crazy now before we go into the next

hgVnEKSFSeA,459680,461520,flipping different ideas it was always

hgVnEKSFSeA,506800,508639,this tech house project file for free in
hgVnEKSFSeA,508639,510879,the description below step number four
hgVnEKSFSeA,510879,512510,the song structure
hgVnEKSFSeA,512510,527519,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,527519,529440,it's all about simplicity so for the
hgVnEKSFSeA,529440,532240,intro slash rise up to the drop we're
hgVnEKSFSeA,532240,534240,going to be teasing the vocal uh maybe
hgVnEKSFSeA,534240,536399,with some reverb and delay and only
hgVnEKSFSeA,536399,538160,small bits at a time so they can kind of
hgVnEKSFSeA,538160,542839,get like a little idea what to expect
hgVnEKSFSeA,548320,550720,and tech house is super simple so we're
hgVnEKSFSeA,550720,552720,only going to be rising it up with white
hgVnEKSFSeA,552720,555279,noise and some snares that's it the
hgVnEKSFSeA,555279,557760,stair riser i have a couple things going
hgVnEKSFSeA,557760,562399,on we have the pitch going up
hgVnEKSFSeA,562399,565040,then we also have a filter
hgVnEKSFSeA,565040,567440,that's being automated to slowly rise up
hgVnEKSFSeA,567440,570800,from being low to high
hgVnEKSFSeA,571120,573839,and then we have a white noise impact
hgVnEKSFSeA,573839,575279,and i made this just by operator it's
hgVnEKSFSeA,575279,579839,just a simple white noise oscillator
hgVnEKSFSeA,580240,581440,and then i put an eq on it and it
hgVnEKSFSeA,581440,585640,automated the filter to go down
hgVnEKSFSeA,591040,592399,and all those elements together are
hgVnEKSFSeA,592399,594399,gonna rise up to build tension and then
hgVnEKSFSeA,594399,597519,it's gonna pause and let the vocal play
hgVnEKSFSeA,597519,599920,alone kind of like as a teaser like just
hgVnEKSFSeA,599920,601600,to get people hyped like oh shoot what's
hgVnEKSFSeA,601600,603279,about to go down and then the beat's
hgVnEKSFSeA,603279,605040,gonna drop with the bass and the kick
hgVnEKSFSeA,605040,608680,and it's gonna be glorious
hgVnEKSFSeA,609930,615399,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,622630,630000,[Music]
hgVnEKSFSeA,630000,632959,holy that sounds so freaking good
hgVnEKSFSeA,632959,634399,what the hell that's like literally a
hgVnEKSFSeA,634399,636240,hit right there i swear if i post this
hgVnEKSFSeA,636240,638240,this might go viral that's crazy like
hgVnEKSFSeA,638240,640240,literally the cool thing is about tech
hgVnEKSFSeA,640240,642000,house you just gotta find that right
hgVnEKSFSeA,642000,644000,idea and as soon as you got it it's all
hgVnEKSFSeA,644000,645600,like smooth sailing you just put some
hgVnEKSFSeA,645600,647839,groovy faces get creative with the drums
hgVnEKSFSeA,647839,650399,and basses and then you have yourself a
hgVnEKSFSeA,650399,651200,hit
hgVnEKSFSeA,651200,653120,all right next step step number five we
hgVnEKSFSeA,653120,655200,got the fine details i went ahead and
hgVnEKSFSeA,655200,656560,gave the vocals a little bit of
hgVnEKSFSeA,656560,659560,compression
hgVnEKSFSeA,660160,662320,get on the floor and what i noticed when
hgVnEKSFSeA,662320,664560,i did this i'm noticing some popping in
