AB7J_BbOeKk,7520,9040,channel for quite some time and we've
AB7J_BbOeKk,9040,10719,built a pretty cool friendship and
AB7J_BbOeKk,10719,12960,actually had the pleasure of meeting him
AB7J_BbOeKk,12960,15440,when i was at brickworld chicago and he
AB7J_BbOeKk,15440,18240,had some pretty awesome stuff on display
AB7J_BbOeKk,18240,20560,at brickworld so we had the opportunity
AB7J_BbOeKk,20560,22640,of interviewing him so we're going to
AB7J_BbOeKk,22640,24160,take a look at all of the art that he
AB7J_BbOeKk,24160,27439,had on display at brickworld chicago
AB7J_BbOeKk,27439,28880,pretty neat and we're also going to take
AB7J_BbOeKk,28880,30480,a look at all of the other stuff that
AB7J_BbOeKk,30480,32398,he's designed as well which includes a
AB7J_BbOeKk,32398,35280,really cool jurassic world display a
AB7J_BbOeKk,35280,38559,couple cool vehicles some more art
AB7J_BbOeKk,38559,40640,and just some really neat stuff so let's
AB7J_BbOeKk,40640,42320,take a look at the stuff that he had at
AB7J_BbOeKk,42320,44480,brookwood chicago via this interview
AB7J_BbOeKk,44480,45840,right now right now we're checking out
AB7J_BbOeKk,45840,48079,tan jam's booth look at the incredible
AB7J_BbOeKk,48079,50559,art that he has built uh can you tell us
AB7J_BbOeKk,50559,52879,a little bit about your art here tenjim
AB7J_BbOeKk,52879,55840,yeah so i got three pieces here i've got
AB7J_BbOeKk,55840,58480,uh we'll start with obi-wan kenobi i
AB7J_BbOeKk,58480,60239,call this one high ground and it's
AB7J_BbOeKk,60239,62239,supposed to be the
AB7J_BbOeKk,62239,64640,episode three or the clone wars version
AB7J_BbOeKk,64640,66799,of general kenobi and
AB7J_BbOeKk,66799,68640,free-handed the
AB7J_BbOeKk,68640,71200,the dot work on the background to look
AB7J_BbOeKk,71200,72720,like mustafar
AB7J_BbOeKk,72720,74560,so that's all free-handed kind of in the
AB7J_BbOeKk,74560,77840,same style as the iron man ultimate art
AB7J_BbOeKk,77840,80159,with the blue and the black background
AB7J_BbOeKk,80159,82560,but i put in some reds and dark reds
AB7J_BbOeKk,82560,84640,oranges that kind of color
AB7J_BbOeKk,84640,86799,but that one's uh pretty appropriate
AB7J_BbOeKk,86799,88720,given uh we're almost done with the
AB7J_BbOeKk,88720,91439,kenobi show
AB7J_BbOeKk,91439,94159,and then uh i've got
AB7J_BbOeKk,94159,97520,this the second piece that i did
AB7J_BbOeKk,97520,100079,i call it one with the force here and
AB7J_BbOeKk,100079,102640,this one is uh is representative of that
AB7J_BbOeKk,102640,104320,iconic scene
AB7J_BbOeKk,104320,107360,from mandalorian season two with ahsoka
AB7J_BbOeKk,107360,110240,and uh says when we finally learned the
AB7J_BbOeKk,110240,112320,child's name
AB7J_BbOeKk,112320,115759,and uh an ahsoka and grogu bond for the
AB7J_BbOeKk,115759,117680,first time so i wanted to capture the
AB7J_BbOeKk,117680,120000,emotion in that scene
AB7J_BbOeKk,120000,122719,it's a mix of plate work uh mainly one
AB7J_BbOeKk,122719,125119,by ones and one by twos
AB7J_BbOeKk,125119,127680,and uh and then some smooth tiles to
AB7J_BbOeKk,127680,129759,help contrast
AB7J_BbOeKk,129759,132640,with the with the artwork
AB7J_BbOeKk,132640,135040,and then my final piece uh i call it
AB7J_BbOeKk,135040,137760,snickt this is inspirational of the john
AB7J_BbOeKk,137760,139440,byrne wolverine
AB7J_BbOeKk,139440,140319,art
AB7J_BbOeKk,140319,144080,in the uh in the late 80s early 90s in
AB7J_BbOeKk,144080,145840,the x-men run
AB7J_BbOeKk,145840,148319,and uh i actually created this one for
AB7J_BbOeKk,148319,150160,an instagram challenge i created as a
AB7J_BbOeKk,150160,152080,digital build
AB7J_BbOeKk,152080,152879,and
AB7J_BbOeKk,152879,155200,um
AB7J_BbOeKk,155200,158239,and never intended to build it at all
AB7J_BbOeKk,158239,161040,and uh and then i
AB7J_BbOeKk,161040,163599,got a got a decent reaction to it and
AB7J_BbOeKk,163599,166959,decided uh to price it out and actually
AB7J_BbOeKk,166959,169519,uh actually build it as my showpiece for
AB7J_BbOeKk,169519,172160,for the convention so this one's uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,172160,173360,you know kind of pulled out all the
AB7J_BbOeKk,173360,175680,stops here i've got a mixture of several
AB7J_BbOeKk,175680,177920,different size of plate i've got some
AB7J_BbOeKk,177920,180159,one by one studs laid over the top of
AB7J_BbOeKk,180159,181280,the plate
AB7J_BbOeKk,181280,183120,the lettering comes out
AB7J_BbOeKk,183120,185760,a brick tall as well
AB7J_BbOeKk,185760,186879,and then
AB7J_BbOeKk,186879,189280,some some cheese wedges alternating
AB7J_BbOeKk,189280,191280,cheese wedges
AB7J_BbOeKk,191280,192560,and then the
AB7J_BbOeKk,192560,194239,the pies
AB7J_BbOeKk,194239,196239,the resistance
AB7J_BbOeKk,196239,198159,defending finishing touch was just
AB7J_BbOeKk,198159,200239,putting the wolverine claws around the
AB7J_BbOeKk,200239,202319,outside edge so uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,202319,204640,228
AB7J_BbOeKk,204640,207680,wolverine claws made up
AB7J_BbOeKk,207680,210159,the framing pieces here
AB7J_BbOeKk,210159,213840,it's incredible man i love your art it's
AB7J_BbOeKk,213840,215360,fantastic and
AB7J_BbOeKk,215360,217200,you know what this one here is like
AB7J_BbOeKk,217200,219680,sitting in the perfect spot because
AB7J_BbOeKk,219680,221519,the cheese wedges just sort of like pick
AB7J_BbOeKk,221519,224480,up the light and it just looks like it's
AB7J_BbOeKk,224480,226480,almost like his claws are like literally
AB7J_BbOeKk,226480,230560,shining i appreciate that yeah yeah

AB7J_BbOeKk,240879,242720,beach bum sig fig
AB7J_BbOeKk,242720,243599,uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,243599,245439,so we get uh we got the beach bum he

AB7J_BbOeKk,250319,253040,from 1970 the shell gas station that's a
AB7J_BbOeKk,253040,255519,printed printed piece
AB7J_BbOeKk,255519,257440,got the little hermit crab behind beside
AB7J_BbOeKk,257440,259519,him
AB7J_BbOeKk,259519,262400,we've got the uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,262400,264960,the legendary walkie-talkie a lot of
AB7J_BbOeKk,264960,266479,people have thought this was the target
AB7J_BbOeKk,266479,268160,walkie-talkie this is actually brick
AB7J_BbOeKk,268160,269680,built here
AB7J_BbOeKk,269680,272160,and uh and i actually made it so you can
AB7J_BbOeKk,272160,273199,depress
AB7J_BbOeKk,273199,275040,the talk button
AB7J_BbOeKk,275040,276880,i've got some springs in here so you can
AB7J_BbOeKk,276880,278720,depress the talk button
AB7J_BbOeKk,278720,280400,and you built that with all lego right
AB7J_BbOeKk,280400,283120,that is all brick
AB7J_BbOeKk,287520,290000,it's impressive how you get the actual
AB7J_BbOeKk,290000,292240,function of pressing the button
AB7J_BbOeKk,292240,294080,absolutely
AB7J_BbOeKk,294080,294960,yes
AB7J_BbOeKk,294960,297280,my kids tried to tell me to actually
AB7J_BbOeKk,297280,299360,make it you know put a walkie-talkie in
AB7J_BbOeKk,299360,301199,there but i just uh couldn't fit one
AB7J_BbOeKk,301199,302639,inside
AB7J_BbOeKk,302639,304320,actually talk and then the last piece i
AB7J_BbOeKk,304320,306800,have here is the uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,306800,308560,this is after one of the sets i had as a
AB7J_BbOeKk,308560,312000,kid this is the wolf pack uh shield
AB7J_BbOeKk,312000,313680,so i've got the little wolf pack guy
AB7J_BbOeKk,313680,316800,here and this is just all all plate work
AB7J_BbOeKk,316800,318639,plate and tile
AB7J_BbOeKk,318639,320320,and then it actually
AB7J_BbOeKk,320320,322479,does have the handle
AB7J_BbOeKk,322479,325039,on the back here to represent the shield
AB7J_BbOeKk,325039,327039,that's such a cool idea of building like
AB7J_BbOeKk,327039,329360,a mini thing accessory or
AB7J_BbOeKk,329360,330800,anything having to do with minifigure
AB7J_BbOeKk,330800,332320,and just like super sizing it i think
AB7J_BbOeKk,332320,334080,that's just an incredible idea
AB7J_BbOeKk,334080,335759,inspiration from the hogwarts icons
AB7J_BbOeKk,335759,338720,collection right just that kind of set
AB7J_BbOeKk,338720,340800,the stage to do that large size build
AB7J_BbOeKk,340800,342479,stuff
AB7J_BbOeKk,342479,344080,that's pretty awesome man well thanks

AB7J_BbOeKk,348320,350000,in the future thanks jordan so
AB7J_BbOeKk,350000,352080,definitely some incredible artwork that
AB7J_BbOeKk,352080,353919,was on display i was blown away by that
AB7J_BbOeKk,353919,355680,wolverine i also really liked the
AB7J_BbOeKk,355680,358080,minifig sort of blowing up stuff like
AB7J_BbOeKk,358080,360319,the shield and the walkie-talkie crazy
AB7J_BbOeKk,360319,361759,how the walkie-talkie was actually
AB7J_BbOeKk,361759,363759,functional like the button press and the
AB7J_BbOeKk,363759,365440,knobs turned and stuff like that i mean
AB7J_BbOeKk,365440,367280,you couldn't actually like you know
AB7J_BbOeKk,367280,369360,communicate through it but i really
AB7J_BbOeKk,369360,370800,enjoyed that i think it's really neat i
AB7J_BbOeKk,370800,373120,can't wait to see what he comes up with
AB7J_BbOeKk,373120,375520,next with like the minifig scale stuff
AB7J_BbOeKk,375520,377199,so not only did he have the stuff on
AB7J_BbOeKk,377199,379039,display at the show but he's also got
AB7J_BbOeKk,379039,381120,some stuff on rebreakable and he's got a
AB7J_BbOeKk,381120,382880,custom
AB7J_BbOeKk,382880,384960,jurassic world scene that he put
AB7J_BbOeKk,384960,387520,together using the studio program so
AB7J_BbOeKk,387520,388880,let's take a look at that because it was
AB7J_BbOeKk,388880,393039,actually submitted to brick huntress's
AB7J_BbOeKk,393039,395360,competition on instagram where everyone
AB7J_BbOeKk,395360,397280,had to come up with different uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,397280,399440,jurassic world themed
AB7J_BbOeKk,399440,401680,creations and submit them there and then
AB7J_BbOeKk,401680,403039,they were sort of like a competition
AB7J_BbOeKk,403039,404479,style and it was actually voted the
AB7J_BbOeKk,404479,405919,winner so let's have a detailed look at
AB7J_BbOeKk,405919,408880,that so this thing is absolutely amazing
AB7J_BbOeKk,408880,411199,we've got the mosasaurus bursting out of
AB7J_BbOeKk,411199,413520,the water there all the water detail
AB7J_BbOeKk,413520,416720,around it is fantastic it is a mills
AB7J_BbOeKk,416720,418960,plate as well so you can see the
AB7J_BbOeKk,418960,420880,open technic pins there so it can clip
AB7J_BbOeKk,420880,422400,into other
AB7J_BbOeKk,422400,424960,modules and you can see the mosasaurus
AB7J_BbOeKk,424960,427120,is just highly detailed it's bursting
AB7J_BbOeKk,427120,429039,out of the water there biting onto the
AB7J_BbOeKk,429039,430800,shark and then there's also
AB7J_BbOeKk,430800,432479,these stands as well with all of the
AB7J_BbOeKk,432479,434800,excited fans of the mosasaurus or
AB7J_BbOeKk,434800,438000,excited jurassic world attendees and
AB7J_BbOeKk,438000,440240,here's another angle of the model so you
AB7J_BbOeKk,440240,442240,can see all the detail of the mosasaurus
AB7J_BbOeKk,442240,444960,it's got the proper colored interior of
AB7J_BbOeKk,444960,447120,his mouth it's got the teeth also a nice
AB7J_BbOeKk,447120,448720,combination of
AB7J_BbOeKk,448720,451440,studs and smooth finish with all of the
AB7J_BbOeKk,451440,453520,different curved slopes plates angle
AB7J_BbOeKk,453520,456000,plates and then also the transition of
AB7J_BbOeKk,456000,458400,the color to the light slash dark gray
AB7J_BbOeKk,458400,460560,on the bottom or the belly of the
AB7J_BbOeKk,460560,462880,mosasaur so it's like spot on it is
AB7J_BbOeKk,462880,466000,simply amazing also the stands is very
AB7J_BbOeKk,466000,467599,detailed with the masonry bricks the
AB7J_BbOeKk,467599,469199,light gray bricks that sort of curve
AB7J_BbOeKk,469199,471039,over top and then it's got
AB7J_BbOeKk,471039,473039,the sort of roof that thing looks
AB7J_BbOeKk,473039,475120,spectacular and then our last image of
AB7J_BbOeKk,475120,476319,it is the
AB7J_BbOeKk,476319,478400,bird's eye view image where you can see
AB7J_BbOeKk,478400,479919,there's a string that's holding that
AB7J_BbOeKk,479919,481599,shark in place for the mosasaurus to
AB7J_BbOeKk,481599,483520,jump up and grab it and here you can see
AB7J_BbOeKk,483520,485520,some of the water detail as well there's
AB7J_BbOeKk,485520,487039,a couple different colors that are used
AB7J_BbOeKk,487039,489360,there to create some really nice water
AB7J_BbOeKk,489360,492080,detail so how about that hey that is a
AB7J_BbOeKk,492080,494639,pretty awesome mock it was once again
AB7J_BbOeKk,494639,496319,done on studio he hasn't actually built
AB7J_BbOeKk,496319,497680,it but i believe he's planning on
AB7J_BbOeKk,497680,499440,building that one uh which is pretty
AB7J_BbOeKk,499440,501280,cool and once again it won
AB7J_BbOeKk,501280,504720,uh the jurassic world competition hosted
AB7J_BbOeKk,504720,505440,by
AB7J_BbOeKk,505440,508000,brick huntress on instagram which is uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,508000,509840,pretty special pretty cool so there's a
AB7J_BbOeKk,509840,511520,couple other things that uh i want to
AB7J_BbOeKk,511520,513279,show you we actually have two of them
AB7J_BbOeKk,513279,514640,right here on my desk and these are some
AB7J_BbOeKk,514640,516000,vehicles that are available on
AB7J_BbOeKk,516000,518640,rebrickable.com we've got a police
AB7J_BbOeKk,518640,520719,cruiser and also a taxi cab so let's
AB7J_BbOeKk,520719,522399,have a detailed look at those and then
AB7J_BbOeKk,522399,524240,there's a couple other things as well so
AB7J_BbOeKk,524240,526560,the first one is a yellow taxi i really
AB7J_BbOeKk,526560,528080,like this design here it looks
AB7J_BbOeKk,528080,529600,phenomenal and the instructions are
AB7J_BbOeKk,529600,531600,available on rebrickable.com for one
AB7J_BbOeKk,531600,532720,dollar
AB7J_BbOeKk,532720,534720,which isn't too bad it is missing a taxi
AB7J_BbOeKk,534720,536320,print piece right there the design does
AB7J_BbOeKk,536320,538480,call for that but i didn't get that one
AB7J_BbOeKk,538480,540399,there and you can open up the interior
AB7J_BbOeKk,540399,542640,just by removing the top just like that
AB7J_BbOeKk,542640,544320,there and you can actually see there's
AB7J_BbOeKk,544320,546480,space for quite a few minifigures there
AB7J_BbOeKk,546480,550640,is a back seat and a front seat there
AB7J_BbOeKk,550640,553040,nicely detailed for sure also the trunk
AB7J_BbOeKk,553040,554800,will open up just like that there so you
AB7J_BbOeKk,554800,557200,can stow away like a briefcase or a
AB7J_BbOeKk,557200,559040,suitcase in there which is definitely
AB7J_BbOeKk,559040,560640,pretty cool so there's a lot of
AB7J_BbOeKk,560640,562800,functionality to the set and i really
AB7J_BbOeKk,562800,564640,enjoy how there's you know space for
AB7J_BbOeKk,564640,566880,multiple minifigures inside and then
AB7J_BbOeKk,566880,569120,also space for you know something in the
AB7J_BbOeKk,569120,570160,trunk i think that's a little bit
AB7J_BbOeKk,570160,572480,different and it sort of differentiates
AB7J_BbOeKk,572480,574959,itself from some of the ones that we see
AB7J_BbOeKk,574959,576959,from official lego sets actually so
AB7J_BbOeKk,576959,579360,that's a really cool little yellow taxi
AB7J_BbOeKk,579360,581279,there the next one is a police cruiser
AB7J_BbOeKk,581279,584160,once again available on rebrickable.com
AB7J_BbOeKk,584160,585680,and this one was a little build here
AB7J_BbOeKk,585680,587519,that was pretty fun to put together once
AB7J_BbOeKk,587519,589040,again you can take that off there there
AB7J_BbOeKk,589040,591120,is room uh for
AB7J_BbOeKk,591120,592399,i believe three minifigures two in the
AB7J_BbOeKk,592399,594720,front seat and uh one in the back seat i
AB7J_BbOeKk,594720,596320,put a vintage police officer in there
AB7J_BbOeKk,596320,598800,that was actually sent to us from a fan
AB7J_BbOeKk,598800,600560,out of the uk his name is rob so thank
AB7J_BbOeKk,600560,602800,you rob for uh sending that but i put my
AB7J_BbOeKk,602800,605920,vint vintage uh policeman in there and
AB7J_BbOeKk,605920,607600,it's really highly detailed and looks
AB7J_BbOeKk,607600,609279,pretty fantastic instructions for one
AB7J_BbOeKk,609279,611120,dollar you really can't go wrong if you
AB7J_BbOeKk,611120,612880,want a custom police cruiser for your
AB7J_BbOeKk,612880,615440,city definitely a good way of going and
AB7J_BbOeKk,615440,616480,i'm just doing this for the goodness of
AB7J_BbOeKk,616480,618800,my heart i love tangent well i okay i

AB7J_BbOeKk,623040,625360,many different ways here on the channel
AB7J_BbOeKk,625360,627440,and uh it was a pleasure meeting him in
AB7J_BbOeKk,627440,628959,chicago so there's actually a couple
AB7J_BbOeKk,628959,630160,other things that i want to show you
AB7J_BbOeKk,630160,633040,that tan jam has uh created
AB7J_BbOeKk,633040,636000,the first one is a darth sidious art and
AB7J_BbOeKk,636000,637519,that's actually right over here in the
AB7J_BbOeKk,637519,639360,lego room on our art wall of course so
AB7J_BbOeKk,639360,641680,we actually created this one here
AB7J_BbOeKk,641680,644320,this one is darth sidious and he is just
AB7J_BbOeKk,644320,646560,hanging out right there above darth maul
AB7J_BbOeKk,646560,649200,i can just envision him uh from
AB7J_BbOeKk,649200,651040,uh what's it called
AB7J_BbOeKk,651040,653440,uh the revenge of the sith my green

AB7J_BbOeKk,655440,658480,duel uh yoda i just think that's so cool
AB7J_BbOeKk,658480,659920,so he did come up with that one there
AB7J_BbOeKk,659920,662560,and it blends together perfectly with uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,662560,665040,all of the different art sets here
AB7J_BbOeKk,665040,667040,on the wall of the sith arts and the
AB7J_BbOeKk,667040,668560,instructions are actually free and all
AB7J_BbOeKk,668560,670720,you need is a sith art to build that one
AB7J_BbOeKk,670720,672240,one other one that he did design was
AB7J_BbOeKk,672240,674560,darth revan as well and once again all
AB7J_BbOeKk,674560,676560,you need is a sith art to build that one
AB7J_BbOeKk,676560,679519,here's an image of it now
AB7J_BbOeKk,680320,681440,see how that one looks pretty good i've
AB7J_BbOeKk,681440,682959,decided not to do that one there i don't
AB7J_BbOeKk,682959,684959,know much backstory on darth revan but
AB7J_BbOeKk,684959,688079,he also created the brixi sigfig art so
AB7J_BbOeKk,688079,689760,he created this
AB7J_BbOeKk,689760,692560,uh all of those art sets that you saw
AB7J_BbOeKk,692560,695760,at the show and then also uh
AB7J_BbOeKk,695760,698160,this one here and darth revan yeah so
AB7J_BbOeKk,698160,700399,pretty cool hey
AB7J_BbOeKk,700399,702399,looks fantastic our art wall is filling
AB7J_BbOeKk,702399,703680,up and i can't wait to add more in the
AB7J_BbOeKk,703680,704560,future
AB7J_BbOeKk,704560,708160,so he has the castaway as his sig fig
AB7J_BbOeKk,708160,710160,which is part of the cmf series
AB7J_BbOeKk,710160,712160,and he actually designed a custom
AB7J_BbOeKk,712160,713200,brickhead
AB7J_BbOeKk,713200,714480,i don't have the brickhead i'm just
AB7J_BbOeKk,714480,716720,showing you my brickheadz here but he
AB7J_BbOeKk,716720,718639,built a or designed a custom brick head
AB7J_BbOeKk,718639,722240,of the castaway check it out right now
AB7J_BbOeKk,722800,724639,so definitely a pretty cool brickhead
AB7J_BbOeKk,724639,726800,there i enjoyed that one he had it at
AB7J_BbOeKk,726800,728720,the show it looked pretty snazzy
AB7J_BbOeKk,728720,730560,and there's a couple other things that
AB7J_BbOeKk,730560,731760,actually one other thing that he helped
AB7J_BbOeKk,731760,732959,us out with
AB7J_BbOeKk,732959,735120,in particular here in the lego city he
AB7J_BbOeKk,735120,737680,actually designed custom street lights
AB7J_BbOeKk,737680,738720,and those are available on
AB7J_BbOeKk,738720,740240,rebrickable.com as well i think those
AB7J_BbOeKk,740240,742079,ones are free the instructions for those
AB7J_BbOeKk,742079,742880,ones
AB7J_BbOeKk,742880,744320,which is pretty neat i'm looking at this
AB7J_BbOeKk,744320,745760,portion of the city looking for a street
AB7J_BbOeKk,745760,747440,light this is the only portion of the
AB7J_BbOeKk,747440,749760,city that's complete at this point but
AB7J_BbOeKk,749760,751360,clearly there's no need for traffic
AB7J_BbOeKk,751360,753600,lights there so i actually have all of
AB7J_BbOeKk,753600,755440,them stowed away right here and
AB7J_BbOeKk,755440,757600,eventually we'll be reintegrating these
AB7J_BbOeKk,757600,760240,into the lego city so he also built
AB7J_BbOeKk,760240,762160,these and provided the instructions on
AB7J_BbOeKk,762160,764560,rebrickable.com so pretty cool
AB7J_BbOeKk,764560,767120,traffic light design and of course
AB7J_BbOeKk,767120,768959,eventually one day we're going to put
AB7J_BbOeKk,768959,771600,all of those back in the lego city so
