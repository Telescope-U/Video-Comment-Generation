A5YnkOHRJ-4,83280,84080,puffy paint
A5YnkOHRJ-4,84080,87280,not in a weird way just i i really like
A5YnkOHRJ-4,87280,89439,puffy paint i have known about diy puffy
A5YnkOHRJ-4,89439,91200,paint for a long time
A5YnkOHRJ-4,91200,93360,i've never actually tried it before what
A5YnkOHRJ-4,93360,94240,you will need
A5YnkOHRJ-4,94240,97280,glue shaving foam food coloring
A5YnkOHRJ-4,97280,100240,bowl spoon measuring cup squeeze bottles
A5YnkOHRJ-4,100240,101600,and a funnel helps
A5YnkOHRJ-4,101600,105520,so you don't need all that right now
A5YnkOHRJ-4,105520,107360,why did i do that there are lots of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,107360,109840,different diy puffy paint recipes out
A5YnkOHRJ-4,109840,111360,there some of them are much more
A5YnkOHRJ-4,111360,113280,complicated they may give you a better
A5YnkOHRJ-4,113280,114320,end result
A5YnkOHRJ-4,114320,116560,but they require a lot of special
A5YnkOHRJ-4,116560,118640,ingredients you gotta heat things up
A5YnkOHRJ-4,118640,121520,and you gotta travel to mars and well i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,121520,123280,just went for like the most
A5YnkOHRJ-4,123280,126479,simple recipe first we will make the
A5YnkOHRJ-4,126479,127520,base
A5YnkOHRJ-4,127520,130399,equal parts shaving foam this is shaving
A5YnkOHRJ-4,130399,130879,gel
A5YnkOHRJ-4,130879,134000,also it's pink
A5YnkOHRJ-4,134720,137440,i don't think this is gonna work this
A5YnkOHRJ-4,137440,139040,will do it luckily i have
A5YnkOHRJ-4,139040,142080,dug up some old shaving foam from
A5YnkOHRJ-4,142080,144800,some project that i did a long time ago
A5YnkOHRJ-4,144800,145520,hoarding
A5YnkOHRJ-4,145520,151360,saves the day equal parts shaving foam
A5YnkOHRJ-4,152239,156640,scrape off the excess there
A5YnkOHRJ-4,156640,159040,i'm hungry now we're gonna pour the same
A5YnkOHRJ-4,159040,160000,amount of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,160000,163360,white glue into the bowl
A5YnkOHRJ-4,163360,166800,lovely lovely lovely stir
A5YnkOHRJ-4,166800,170080,them up and guess what bam puffy paint
A5YnkOHRJ-4,170080,173280,kind of it does look much thinner than a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,173280,174800,normal puffy paint
A5YnkOHRJ-4,174800,177440,add your food coloring however you like
A5YnkOHRJ-4,177440,179040,then we just mix that up
A5YnkOHRJ-4,179040,182319,and look at how beautiful it is
A5YnkOHRJ-4,182319,185599,oh beautiful oh wonderful
A5YnkOHRJ-4,185599,187840,gorgeous there we go that's what i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,187840,189120,wanted a little
A5YnkOHRJ-4,189120,191760,lovely purple i am going to add mine
A5YnkOHRJ-4,191760,193120,into a squeeze bottle and i'm going to
A5YnkOHRJ-4,193120,193920,use a funnel
A5YnkOHRJ-4,193920,197680,or our paint oh
A5YnkOHRJ-4,197680,200079,come on
A5YnkOHRJ-4,201040,203920,and ages later paint is in a squeeze
A5YnkOHRJ-4,203920,204959,bottle let's
A5YnkOHRJ-4,204959,208000,test this out ah okay
A5YnkOHRJ-4,208000,210560,okay it definitely is thinner than
A5YnkOHRJ-4,210560,212400,store-bought puffy paint but i kind of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,212400,214000,like how it comes out it's very
A5YnkOHRJ-4,214000,216319,smooth i think that this will work but
A5YnkOHRJ-4,216319,226800,first i need to make a few more colors
A5YnkOHRJ-4,226800,229899,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,233970,241860,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,241860,243750,[Applause]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,243750,250400,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,250400,253120,wonderful now that we have our paint in
A5YnkOHRJ-4,253120,256079,the colors of our choice
A5YnkOHRJ-4,256079,257280,i don't think that this is going to be
A5YnkOHRJ-4,257280,259280,super long-lasting paint
A5YnkOHRJ-4,259280,261040,so you're going to want to use it right
A5YnkOHRJ-4,261040,262560,away now my plan
A5YnkOHRJ-4,262560,266000,is to use it on this this set of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,266000,269120,vases losses
A5YnkOHRJ-4,269120,270800,oh of course if you already have
A5YnkOHRJ-4,270800,272400,something laying around that's great
A5YnkOHRJ-4,272400,273600,that's ideal but
A5YnkOHRJ-4,273600,275280,i just wanted to get something special
A5YnkOHRJ-4,275280,276880,i'm just gonna decorate
A5YnkOHRJ-4,276880,282310,these with these so let's do that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,282310,294840,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,294840,297840,do
A5YnkOHRJ-4,302910,306099,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,307280,310720,okay my vases are finally done and dry
A5YnkOHRJ-4,310720,312479,i think that there are probably very
A5YnkOHRJ-4,312479,314960,limited uses for this paint it doesn't
A5YnkOHRJ-4,314960,316000,really stay
A5YnkOHRJ-4,316000,318639,puffy and smooth it kind of collapses
A5YnkOHRJ-4,318639,319919,and creates this like
A5YnkOHRJ-4,319919,324880,weird wrinkly texture i hadn't done
A5YnkOHRJ-4,324880,326639,whoops i would probably be really mad
A5YnkOHRJ-4,326639,328800,about it if i hadn't done something like
A5YnkOHRJ-4,328800,331680,abstract but honestly i think it kind of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,331680,332560,looks cool
A5YnkOHRJ-4,332560,335600,i did get some fake flowers to put in
A5YnkOHRJ-4,335600,336400,each one
A5YnkOHRJ-4,336400,339120,so this is like a little decor moment
A5YnkOHRJ-4,339120,340160,room decor
A5YnkOHRJ-4,340160,343360,home decor shelf decor decor
A5YnkOHRJ-4,343360,346560,so make some modern art room decor
A5YnkOHRJ-4,346560,348320,or something else i'm not trying to
A5YnkOHRJ-4,348320,350160,control your life moving on to the next
A5YnkOHRJ-4,350160,350639,idea
A5YnkOHRJ-4,350639,355039,we have customize a puzzle
A5YnkOHRJ-4,356240,358240,so what you will need for this is
A5YnkOHRJ-4,358240,359360,obviously
A5YnkOHRJ-4,359360,362639,a puzzle this is clearly a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,362639,365440,baby puzzle nice little farm scene going

A5YnkOHRJ-4,366000,368319,i got this specifically to customize it
A5YnkOHRJ-4,368319,369520,it's nice thick
A5YnkOHRJ-4,369520,371360,wood and i think that that's going to be
A5YnkOHRJ-4,371360,373520,our best bet when customizing
A5YnkOHRJ-4,373520,377039,therefore baby puzzle
A5YnkOHRJ-4,377039,379600,oh why i didn't expect that to happen i

A5YnkOHRJ-4,381199,383919,let me just do this puzzle real quick
A5YnkOHRJ-4,383919,384720,okay i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,384720,387039,is smart never painted a puzzle before i

A5YnkOHRJ-4,388639,390319,item to customize maybe you hadn't
A5YnkOHRJ-4,390319,391360,thought about before

A5YnkOHRJ-4,396020,399360,[Music]
A5YnkOHRJ-4,399360,408620,by gessoing this
A5YnkOHRJ-4,408620,414860,[Music]

A5YnkOHRJ-4,479360,482000,i just want to eat it so bright and
A5YnkOHRJ-4,482000,482639,summery

A5YnkOHRJ-4,486000,488160,i don't know i just made it up i used
A5YnkOHRJ-4,488160,490639,poscas on top of this felt like pastas
A5YnkOHRJ-4,490639,491039,were
A5YnkOHRJ-4,491039,494000,less likely to seal the pieces together
A5YnkOHRJ-4,494000,496319,i did have to take out all the pieces
A5YnkOHRJ-4,496319,498560,and put some matte varnish on all of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,498560,500720,them individually just to make sure that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,500720,502400,i don't completely seal the pieces
A5YnkOHRJ-4,502400,503039,together
A5YnkOHRJ-4,503039,504960,and now it's nice and protected so that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,504960,506080,the paint isn't chipping
A5YnkOHRJ-4,506080,508000,and you can actually use it and you know
A5YnkOHRJ-4,508000,509840,if you're super bored once you finish
A5YnkOHRJ-4,509840,511680,painting it then you can just uh take it
A5YnkOHRJ-4,511680,512479,apart and put it
A5YnkOHRJ-4,512479,514560,back together 15 times because this is a

A5YnkOHRJ-4,609920,612240,to sew before you freak out
A5YnkOHRJ-4,612240,615120,chill breathe relax i don't know how to
A5YnkOHRJ-4,615120,615920,sew either
A5YnkOHRJ-4,615920,618240,but the great thing is we are not
A5YnkOHRJ-4,618240,619120,embroidering
A5YnkOHRJ-4,619120,621279,a dress for the queen we're making a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,621279,622480,plush out of a sock
A5YnkOHRJ-4,622480,624480,all you need to know is tie a knot at
A5YnkOHRJ-4,624480,626800,one end in out in out in out high knot
A5YnkOHRJ-4,626800,628320,at the other hand it'll do the trick
A5YnkOHRJ-4,628320,631279,start at one end of the curve tie knot
A5YnkOHRJ-4,631279,632160,now remember
A5YnkOHRJ-4,632160,634959,in out in out in out and out just sewing
A5YnkOHRJ-4,634959,636399,along that line
A5YnkOHRJ-4,636399,638399,okay we've reached the end now tie
A5YnkOHRJ-4,638399,639600,another knot just
A5YnkOHRJ-4,639600,642720,you know do that or something we
A5YnkOHRJ-4,642720,645760,cut off the excess flip that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,645760,648720,inside out this looks weird stuffing
A5YnkOHRJ-4,648720,651040,time
A5YnkOHRJ-4,651040,654160,polyfill we take a generous handful i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,654160,654959,like a nice
A5YnkOHRJ-4,654959,657680,firm stuffing i want it to be nice and
A5YnkOHRJ-4,657680,658959,plump
A5YnkOHRJ-4,658959,661760,and you see how the elastic makes a nice
A5YnkOHRJ-4,661760,662480,closure
A5YnkOHRJ-4,662480,664320,that's why we do it this way i'm gonna
A5YnkOHRJ-4,664320,666000,do the eyes at this point
A5YnkOHRJ-4,666000,668640,safety eyes you could use buttons you
A5YnkOHRJ-4,668640,669360,could use

A5YnkOHRJ-4,881760,884880,this much yarn i wanted all the colors
A5YnkOHRJ-4,884880,888160,and then you'll also need this baby
A5YnkOHRJ-4,888160,892240,steering wheel this is the wreath form
A5YnkOHRJ-4,892240,894160,you can get these at like any craft

A5YnkOHRJ-4,903760,907600,and you can make do with just that but i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,907600,910880,got a pom pom maker it is a little
A5YnkOHRJ-4,910880,912800,device that helps you make
A5YnkOHRJ-4,912800,915360,pom-poms if you don't have one of these
A5YnkOHRJ-4,915360,916240,fear not
A5YnkOHRJ-4,916240,918880,you can use your fingers or you can use
A5YnkOHRJ-4,918880,920639,the cardboard technique which i
A5YnkOHRJ-4,920639,922560,actually have demonstrated in a past
A5YnkOHRJ-4,922560,924000,video i'll put that link in the
A5YnkOHRJ-4,924000,924800,description
A5YnkOHRJ-4,924800,926639,any technique that you're using whether
A5YnkOHRJ-4,926639,928720,it's this a piece of cardboard
A5YnkOHRJ-4,928720,931040,or your fingers all you have to do to
A5YnkOHRJ-4,931040,932079,make a pom-pom
A5YnkOHRJ-4,932079,935040,is wrap the yarn around the device or
A5YnkOHRJ-4,935040,937120,the cardboard template or your fingers
A5YnkOHRJ-4,937120,938160,if you're doing it that way
A5YnkOHRJ-4,938160,940320,over and over and over again you want to
A5YnkOHRJ-4,940320,942000,build up a couple layers make sure that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,942000,943680,the yarn is nice and dense because
A5YnkOHRJ-4,943680,945199,that's going to give you the fluffiest
A5YnkOHRJ-4,945199,945920,pom-pom
A5YnkOHRJ-4,945920,948399,then once you've created a full circle
A5YnkOHRJ-4,948399,949600,then you just go through
A5YnkOHRJ-4,949600,951920,and cut through all those little loops
A5YnkOHRJ-4,951920,953040,that you've created
A5YnkOHRJ-4,953040,955519,then you just have to tie off all of the
A5YnkOHRJ-4,955519,956560,little threads
A5YnkOHRJ-4,956560,958399,make sure that it's secured and then you
A5YnkOHRJ-4,958399,960560,can release your pom-pom
A5YnkOHRJ-4,960560,962720,and bam there's your pom-pom also with
A5YnkOHRJ-4,962720,964320,the pom-pom maker it makes it really
A5YnkOHRJ-4,964320,965199,easy to do
A5YnkOHRJ-4,965199,967680,multiple colors in one pom pom so you
A5YnkOHRJ-4,967680,969519,can kind of get the half and half look
A5YnkOHRJ-4,969519,971519,which i'm a big fan of just gonna do
A5YnkOHRJ-4,971519,971839,that
A5YnkOHRJ-4,971839,975360,one or two or ten thousand more times
A5YnkOHRJ-4,975360,977360,until i have enough pom-poms
A5YnkOHRJ-4,977360,980959,oh my gosh this is a lot of pom-poms how
A5YnkOHRJ-4,980959,982800,many pom-poms does it take to cover a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,982800,983519,wreath form
A5YnkOHRJ-4,983519,985120,i don't know by the way most of these
A5YnkOHRJ-4,985120,987120,did have to be made in advance
A5YnkOHRJ-4,987120,990000,this could easily take all day perfect
A5YnkOHRJ-4,990000,991440,if you've got nothing to do
A5YnkOHRJ-4,991440,993279,and it's actually a pretty fun and
A5YnkOHRJ-4,993279,997839,relaxing activity it's very
A5YnkOHRJ-4,998560,1001839,nice it's enjoyable all right assembly
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1001839,1003040,time
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1003040,1005759,hot glue gun
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1006079,1008839,ow and i'm gonna attach some sort of
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1008839,1011680,hanger
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1011680,1014959,glue the end down glue it there i don't
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1014959,1016480,really know i'm kind of just making this
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1016480,1017199,up
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1017199,1020639,oh sure that'll do it
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1020639,1023040,finally i get to start gluing these
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1023040,1024798,freaking pom-poms
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1024798,1039839,okay let's just start
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1041600,1044798,wow oh it's so soft and colorful and
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1044798,1045360,fluffy
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1045360,1046720,when i started gluing them on i thought
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1046720,1048558,that maybe the amount of pom-poms i had
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1048558,1050080,made was way overkill
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1050080,1053039,but it needs a lot of pom-poms this is
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1053039,1054000,all i have left
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1054000,1055600,does it need a bow i think it needs a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1055600,1057679,bow what if we just finish it off a
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1057679,1058799,little bit
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1058799,1061280,yes i like it i don't know some people
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1061280,1062160,don't like bows
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1062160,1064960,whatever i love it it's beautiful this
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1064960,1066960,is so cute i'm so excited to hang this
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1066960,1067919,up in my
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1067919,1070720,space it's so colorful and festive and
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1070720,1072160,takes forever so
A5YnkOHRJ-4,1072160,1074320,perfect little craft opportunity if you
