NkT28jang70,80,5920,you have to buy into the fact that  you're usually bad at dealing with  people  you're not seeing who they are you're
NkT28jang70,5920,11440,seeing reflections of your own  your own fantasies or projections you  have to admit that you're not good at
NkT28jang70,11440,16800,dealing with people and you need to  improve  if you understand that and you want to  change and you're motivated
NkT28jang70,16800,22890,to get out of your shell then  [Music]
NkT28jang70,24720,30720,how do we understand the strength of  someone's character whether they're  toxic whether they're
NkT28jang70,30720,37120,they have high values besides this you  know the things that we can see  of like okay they broke their word or
NkT28jang70,37120,42800,they're negative or things like that  how do we really determine someone's  character well the first thing you have
NkT28jang70,42800,48719,to do  the most important thing is to realize  that determining people's character is
NkT28jang70,48719,54320,the most important thing  that you have to do in judging them so  normally
NkT28jang70,54320,60079,we think if someone's very charming that  that's great  or if they're really good looking or if
NkT28jang70,60079,67360,they're very successful  so if we're looking let's say we're  looking for a business partner  or a romantic partner or a colleague to
NkT28jang70,67360,73360,work with  we're going to base our decision on  those kinds of appearances  like people can be very good at
NkT28jang70,73360,78799,deceiving you with being very charming  and flattering  or they have a brilliant resume and
NkT28jang70,78799,83840,you'll be seduced by that  and what you want to do the first step  in that law is to say no that's not how
NkT28jang70,83840,89680,i'm going to judge people  my main value is their character and the  strength of their character
NkT28jang70,89680,95920,and character is something from deep  deep deep within  the word character comes from the greek
NkT28jang70,95920,103360,khairos  which means to carve and character is  something really  deeply carved inside the person it's who
NkT28jang70,103360,108479,they are at their core  it creates patterns of behavior that  they can't even really control
NkT28jang70,108479,114399,it's who they are genetically it's who  they are from  the early values of their parents so you
NkT28jang70,114399,120640,want to connect to that you want to see  that  it's not immediately visible to you  because people will disguise their
NkT28jang70,120640,127040,character  you want to see that you want to value  it more than anything else  and what you want are people with strong
NkT28jang70,127040,133040,character and what that means is  people they have an expression for
NkT28jang70,133040,138879,metal they call it tensile where a metal  is  stronger if it can give a little bit and
NkT28jang70,138879,145360,it because if something is too rigid if  it breaks  it breaks so you want people who are  adaptable who can be fluid
NkT28jang70,145360,150480,who aren't weak because that metal isn't  weak  who have an inner strength and a core to
NkT28jang70,150480,158640,them but they can bend  they can learn they can adapt they can  change  you want to see people um who
NkT28jang70,158640,163680,are empathetic you know who  who know how to get along with other
NkT28jang70,163680,169680,people so  if you have two people to choose and one  has a glittering resume but the other  person
NkT28jang70,169680,176400,understands human nature and is superior  in a social sense  and can also has a good work ethic you
NkT28jang70,176400,182720,choose that other person you don't  choose necessarily the person  with that glittering resume um and so
NkT28jang70,182720,188640,the one  one of the things you look for are  patterns in people in judging their  character
NkT28jang70,188640,194800,because people reveal themselves in the  past they reveal who they are through  their actions
NkT28jang70,194800,201200,they try and disguise it but they reveal  it so i say in that  chapter nobody ever does anything
NkT28jang70,201200,206400,once so let's say you have a friend  who does something kind of nasty to you
NkT28jang70,206400,212000,they talk behind your back  then they'll say oh robert robert that  was just something came over
NkT28jang70,212000,218879,that isn't me you know i'm sorry about  that that just happened  circumstances made me do that and you'll
NkT28jang70,218879,225840,be likely to believe them  but the fact is if they've done that  once they've probably done it many times
NkT28jang70,225840,231840,if  people gossip and you hear them  gossiping about other people  they'll probably eventually gossip about
NkT28jang70,231840,237920,you  so you want to be able to look at  people's patterns and look at their past
NkT28jang70,237920,244080,and see trends and  understand that if they've done certain  things in the past they will continue to
NkT28jang70,244080,250319,do them because  we humans have compulsive behavior  we are compelled to repeat the same
NkT28jang70,250319,257120,mistakes over and over and over again  how do we how do we um stop that pattern
NkT28jang70,257120,264080,if we recognize it within ourselves my  character's been off i've been doing  something  you know for years a certain way that i
NkT28jang70,264080,269280,don't want to do anymore  how do we do it so we can strengthen our  character but also
NkT28jang70,269280,275040,say you know what i believe this other  person can have a stronger character  through breaking a pattern or is it just
NkT28jang70,275040,281840,not possible  of course it's possible at the end of  every chapter  i show you how you can turn this
NkT28jang70,281840,288400,potentially negative quality into a  positive quality  so when it comes to you and
NkT28jang70,288400,293440,your own patterns you have to first  realize that you have these patterns
NkT28jang70,293440,300160,before you can even begin to break them  so awareness  yeah honesty this book about awareness  and being honest with yourself
NkT28jang70,300160,307199,if you don't admit that you have these  patterns then you can't possibly break  them  i know in writing books i have two
NkT28jang70,307199,313280,terrible terrible patterns like what  well stressing so much over things that
NkT28jang70,313280,321520,aren't that important  obsessing stressing obsessing um  i take note cards for everything that i
NkT28jang70,321520,327600,read  all my research and i take way too much  too much information i have like  thousands of them writing
NkT28jang70,327600,333280,i have to stop and i say stop being so  such a perfectionist it's it's like  you're wasting your time
NkT28jang70,333280,338639,it's been book after book after book i'm  very aware of it  and i'm very aware of breaking that
NkT28jang70,338639,345280,pattern but you have to see it and be  honest with yourself in order to break  it  you know right so that's the first step
NkT28jang70,345280,351440,is  is seeing the pattern and then not  struggling against it not trying to be  somebody who you're not
NkT28jang70,351440,357600,but find a way to use that pattern  to use that problem to your advantage
NkT28jang70,357600,365280,similar to what ryan  holliday wrote in his book the obstacle  is the way  i have an example in the book of an
NkT28jang70,365280,370880,actress joan crawford from the  hollywood classical period and she had a  very
NkT28jang70,370880,379120,troubled childhood didn't know her  father her mother  beat her men abused her etc
NkT28jang70,379120,385919,and she managed to take and it was  creating terrible patterns in her life  and she found a way to turn that around
NkT28jang70,385919,392479,to use all of those disadvantages and  make them  make herself much stronger and very  powerful perform
NkT28jang70,392479,400720,by bringing all of the pain in her  childhood into her acting  by becoming so focused on the director
NkT28jang70,400720,406479,because she had been abused she was very  sensitive to other people  she used that sensitivity to focus on
NkT28jang70,406479,412560,the director and other actors to be in  tune with them  to connect with them to build a  relationship essentially
NkT28jang70,412560,418960,yeah she was very aware of her own  weaknesses and her own  fragility and she was able to use that
NkT28jang70,418960,424960,as a strength  um so with other people it's never  hopeless
NkT28jang70,424960,430080,i mean some people are toxic i talk a  lot of they're about toxic characters
NkT28jang70,430080,437440,people those are the kinds of people who  can't really change their patterns are  too ingrained  and we've all met people like that we've
NkT28jang70,437440,442800,all had to deal with the narcissist  who's so deeply self-absorbed there's
NkT28jang70,442800,448720,nothing that's ever going to save them  or pull them out of that  that's self-absorption unless they have  like a near-death experience or they
NkT28jang70,448720,454639,have  someone close to them that's true you  know something that's true big  awakening that's true or they get sick
NkT28jang70,454639,460960,or whatever right  you're right that happens that does  happen sometimes  sometimes it does but you have to be
NkT28jang70,460960,466479,honest that there are people out there  you can't be naive there are people out  there who are toxic
NkT28jang70,466479,473520,who are dangerous who can ruin your life  you hire the wrong person and i've dealt
NkT28jang70,473520,480400,with a lot of in my consulting with a  lot of people who  hired a business partner who ended up  sort of taking the business from them
NkT28jang70,480400,486960,very common scenario you have to not be  naive and recognize these toxic types
NkT28jang70,486960,493039,and often it's best not to try and  change them because  trying to change them entangles you in a
NkT28jang70,493039,499120,lot of their  drama and it just it's just never going  to happen  you might be trying for years and
NkT28jang70,499120,506319,wasting your time and energy  but you know people have to be able to  to change themselves
NkT28jang70,506319,512080,you know they have to be motivated you  can help illuminate some of their  patterns and their problems
NkT28jang70,512080,517120,but it has to come from within yeah now  you talk about the law of self-sabotage
NkT28jang70,517120,523680,yeah and you know we could self-sabotage  ourselves by  attracting toxic people but also what
NkT28jang70,523680,532000,are other ways that we  sabotage ourselves well  um it's this is a chapter about your
NkT28jang70,532000,539760,attitude in life  right and um  the point of that chapter is related to
NkT28jang70,539760,547600,human nature  is none of us see the world in the same  way  so you and i could go watch a movie it's
NkT28jang70,547600,552959,the same  movie that we're watching i love it i  see something  you hate it you see something else you
NkT28jang70,552959,560000,don't experience it the same way  we're watching the same world the same  reality but we experience it differently
NkT28jang70,560000,567040,everybody you meet is experiencing their  world differently than you are  so you have an attitude that colors what
NkT28jang70,567040,572240,you see  and some people have an attitude that  tends towards the negative
NkT28jang70,572240,578800,and i describe a negative attitude to  something that's closed  so you're not open to new experience
NkT28jang70,578800,584640,you're trying to  close that lens you once you have  certain beliefs
NkT28jang70,584640,590560,certain ideas about life and you're not  willing to change them  right because that gives you a sense of
NkT28jang70,590560,596160,security  and so you want an attitude that's  expansive
NkT28jang70,596160,602720,where you accept people you're not  always judging them you're not negative  about them you understand that people
NkT28jang70,602720,608079,that can't necessarily help who they are  um  you're open to change you're open to
NkT28jang70,608079,613600,being to having adventure  and that kind of attitude kind of gives
NkT28jang70,613600,620079,you  a certain degree of freedom so that the  worst thing that happened to you  and you're able to transform that into
NkT28jang70,620079,627040,something good  so um your question was how do we  recognize when we're sabotaging
NkT28jang70,627040,633839,ourselves  and what's the things we do most to  self-sabotage
NkT28jang70,634160,641600,well um if we have  a setback or a failure in life which is
NkT28jang70,641600,647120,inevitable  do we do one of two things do we
NkT28jang70,647120,652399,analyze ourselves and see what we did  wrong  and how we could change ourselves or do
NkT28jang70,652399,659519,we immediately look outward and blame  other people  that person screwed me society doesn't
NkT28jang70,659519,664640,like me  because of these circumstances i'm i'm  screwed and i can never help it
NkT28jang70,664640,669920,it's the world it's not me that's a  self-sabotaging pattern of behavior
NkT28jang70,669920,676959,because if you're always pointing  fingers at other people and blaming them  you're never going to learn from your  experiences and you're
NkT28jang70,676959,684399,going to end up being quite bitter so  that's probably one of the most  the main sources of a self-sabotaging
NkT28jang70,684399,690079,so you could easily say this stupid bee  that stung my neck that caused this
NkT28jang70,690079,696640,blood clot and this high pressure in me  i blame the bee  for this you know stroke that i had
NkT28jang70,696640,702240,screw you b  or you could take responsibility and say  well what did i do to my health leading
NkT28jang70,702240,707440,up to the bee sting  you know for years and taking full  ownership and responsibility that's what  i'm hearing
NkT28jang70,707440,712800,yeah that's what you're hearing yeah  that the the story and the perception  around the experience
NkT28jang70,712800,719360,the way you see that movie playing out  well  having a positive attitude around it and
NkT28jang70,719360,726880,being and reflecting about you the role  that you played and what happened  so we can't we're not in charge of
NkT28jang70,726880,734079,everything that happens in life there  are circumstances that are beyond our  control  right but a lot of what does happen to
NkT28jang70,734079,741760,us is  something that we do that we are  responsible for  there are amazing studies about the role
NkT28jang70,741760,749200,of attitude and what happens to you in  life  so they have this thing called the  pygmalion effect
NkT28jang70,749200,754720,teachers who treat a student  as if they are smart and going to do
NkT28jang70,754720,760000,well those students end up doing well  right so how you treat people how you
NkT28jang70,760000,767680,think about yourself  has a great impact on what happens to  you  when doctors prescribe a new medication
NkT28jang70,767680,774560,there's always the same trend that when  a new medication  has been invented the success rate is
NkT28jang70,774560,781519,like 80 percent  because people believe in it because  it's new and then like  two years later it starts going down
NkT28jang70,781519,787600,because it's not yeah  it's a placebo effect so if you believe  something is going to work
NkT28jang70,787600,793839,if you believe that you are great and  you you deserve good things that you are  a good student  you will end up making those things
NkT28jang70,793839,800240,happen so how you look at yourself  will often determine what ends up  happening to yourself
NkT28jang70,800240,807440,so if you're talking about what what  causes self-sabotage  if you go through life thinking god i'm
NkT28jang70,807440,813040,not really that good  you know there's something wrong with me  i don't really deserve good things i
NkT28jang70,813040,818480,don't deserve to have a lot of success  or to have a lot of money people read
NkT28jang70,818480,824560,that  off of you a major theme in this book is  that  we are masters at reading people's body
NkT28jang70,824560,829839,language and nonverbal  behavior so when somebody feels that  they don't deserve
NkT28jang70,829839,836399,things it's kind of an off-putting  quality in them  and it pushes people away so you create
NkT28jang70,836399,842480,self-fulfilling dynamics  by how you look at yourself and your  attitude i had a chapter in
NkT28jang70,842480,848399,the the 48 laws of power called  think like a king to be treated like one
NkT28jang70,848399,855040,and there's a story of christopher  columbus  who came from dirt poor poverty but  imagined that he was royalty
NkT28jang70,855040,860240,and by imagining that people started  treating him like that  and as they treated him like that he
NkT28jang70,860240,867519,felt even more  kind of greater about himself and he was  able to to  convince the king of portugal to give
NkT28jang70,867519,875199,him these ships  when in fact he was sort of a mediocre  ad  captain so your attitude and how you
NkT28jang70,875199,882079,think about yourself  sort of determine how people treat you  and what happens in life  yeah i you know i always say that we're
NkT28jang70,882079,887120,either  you know life's an enrollment game and  we're either enrolling people in our
NkT28jang70,887120,892720,vision or  unenrolling people by the way we're  showing up our energy our language
NkT28jang70,892720,898240,what do you mean by enrolling i'm  enrolling you  to come on my show yeah and getting you
NkT28jang70,898240,905360,to come on my show because  of the energy i put out the relationship  we have and the connection the platform
NkT28jang70,905360,910639,or i'm unenrolling you by by  the way i've treated you over the last
NkT28jang70,910639,916320,six or seven years but yeah the platform  being out of integrity or not doing that  well
NkT28jang70,916320,921839,you're not going to be as excited to  want to say yes yeah  you know we're we're influencing people
NkT28jang70,921839,928639,all the time  you are influencing people right yes  everything you do people are reading and
NkT28jang70,928639,933680,they're either saying  i like that or i don't like yeah or i'm  indifferent yeah
NkT28jang70,933680,939360,yes it's like i'm enrolling you yes or  i'm not enrolling you as a no  and you talk about the you know the
NkT28jang70,939360,944959,chapter that i really like is  um about seven number seven where are we
NkT28jang70,944959,951199,out here  where am i out here where are they  people's resistance
NkT28jang70,951199,956320,no okay where are we at the person  the persuasive one yeah seven is that
NkT28jang70,956320,962720,one yeah right here  the five strategies to becoming a master  persuader  that this one yeah right here seven yeah
NkT28jang70,962720,967920,well you louis don't need to read that  chapter because you already have that  kind of mastered but i think people need
NkT28jang70,967920,975440,to understand this  yeah because i think what we just talked  about  right there is probably one of the most
NkT28jang70,975440,981120,powerful parts of this whole book in my  mind  and in life is are you enrolling people
NkT28jang70,981120,986480,in your vision  in in being the king or queen and  getting the ships that you want
NkT28jang70,986480,993519,are you are you stepping up and  enrolling people  and getting people to say yes to you  yeah or your dreams or hire you
NkT28jang70,993519,998639,or date you or marry you yeah or  are you not showing up in a way that
NkT28jang70,998639,1004079,people want to say yes to you  right and i feel like key question my  whole
NkT28jang70,1004079,1009279,business has been built on getting  people to say yes when i had nothing  you know i was on my sister's couch ten
NkT28jang70,1009279,1017519,years ago yeah no money  yeah no skills no degree and it was an  energy that i had to learn how to just
NkT28jang70,1017519,1024319,get people to say yes  and yeah more and then building momentum  around that  um so i'd love to talk about this
NkT28jang70,1024319,1029918,becoming a master persuader  and the first thing you talk about is  which i think most people aren't doing
NkT28jang70,1029918,1037280,you say is to deepen your listening and  get a better listener  most people don't have the patience
NkT28jang70,1037280,1044000,to care about someone else they're so  concerned about what they think about  them  well people always talk about being a a
NkT28jang70,1044000,1050480,better listener  and their advice is usually very weak i  mean it doesn't ineffective because okay
NkT28jang70,1050480,1056559,i've become a better listener  yeah i'll try that but it's very hard to  overcome certain patterns
NkT28jang70,1056559,1061919,so i try to tackle the question of why  is it that you're not a good listener
NkT28jang70,1061919,1068160,and at the root of that is you're more  interested in yourself  than you are in the other person you
NkT28jang70,1068160,1074400,won't deny that you will say oh no  no that's not me that's not me i really  like people but the truth is
NkT28jang70,1074400,1079679,you're more interested in your own  thoughts and your own ideas  things that you're so certain about your
NkT28jang70,1079679,1085200,own experiences  than about that other person and what  they're saying what's going on inside  them
NkT28jang70,1085200,1091440,if you can flip that around if you can  actually feel the motivation to get  inside louis and get inside his head in
NkT28jang70,1091440,1099039,his experience  then you will suddenly will become a  better listener that's the key  not just telling people to listen more
NkT28jang70,1099039,1105919,the key is the quality of the listening  and the emotion involved so if i feel i  want to get inside that other person
NkT28jang70,1105919,1113280,inside their life  then suddenly you will start listening  what will make you  interested in other people well first
NkT28jang70,1113280,1119600,off is the idea you don't know them  normally when you're let's say you're on  a first date with someone or you're just
NkT28jang70,1119600,1124880,meeting someone  you have assumptions about them you  create a simplified version of who they
NkT28jang70,1124880,1131440,are  and that's what you think you know and  that'll stay with you forever  instead you want to think that person is
NkT28jang70,1131440,1137919,more interesting than i imagine i  their first appearance isn't really who  they are they're like a book that i
NkT28jang70,1137919,1143600,could read  we love going to movies and getting  inside other characters
NkT28jang70,1143600,1150320,and what motivates them being taken  along for a ride  think of the people that you meet in  life as a character in a movie
NkT28jang70,1150320,1157039,you want to know what motivates them  they are more interesting than you think  they've had traumas they've had problems
NkT28jang70,1157039,1162480,from their early childhood  they have fantasies they have a shadow a  dark side to their personality they're
NkT28jang70,1162480,1169280,not revealing  they're more complicated and interesting  than you think  so if you're motivated to understand
NkT28jang70,1169280,1177600,what makes them tick  their experience suddenly you will start  listening yeah  so that's the key to me and it's not
NkT28jang70,1177600,1185919,easy  why is it so hard for people because for  me it's it's been an easy  thing because i've used my insecurity of
NkT28jang70,1185919,1193120,not feeling like i was smart enough  growing up because i was one of the  poorest students in school  yeah so i was like my voice doesn't
NkT28jang70,1193120,1200320,matter as much  let me just ask smart people what they  think  right and it became a huge advantage for
NkT28jang70,1200320,1206400,me right because  i've learned that being the most  interested person in the room you become
NkT28jang70,1206400,1212240,the most interesting  well the key is really so much in the  book is
NkT28jang70,1212240,1218080,are you motivated to change yourself  do you want to become successful in life
NkT28jang70,1218080,1225919,this book is trying to realign  your priorities and how you look at the  world normally your focus is on yourself
NkT28jang70,1225919,1231200,and on your work and the techniques in  your work  you know the the skills you have to
NkT28jang70,1231200,1238159,master and i'm telling you the key to  success in life is people  we're a social animal you know we're
NkT28jang70,1238159,1243280,like dogs or wolves or whatever  chimpanzees we're a social animal
NkT28jang70,1243280,1249360,and how we interact with people will  determine how far we get  you can be brilliant at hacking
NkT28jang70,1249360,1254400,computers or whatever  but if you're terrible with people your  life is going to be hell
NkT28jang70,1254400,1260720,so you are you motivated to become  somebody supremely skilled  at understanding and working at peop
NkT28jang70,1260720,1266640,with people that's the whole point of  the book  you have to buy into that you have to  buy into the fact that you're usually
NkT28jang70,1266640,1272559,bad  at dealing with people you're not seeing  who they are you're seeing reflections  of your own
NkT28jang70,1272559,1277919,your own fantasies or projections you  have to admit that you're not good at  dealing with people and you need to
NkT28jang70,1277919,1285200,improve  if you're that if you understand that  and you want to change and you're  motivated  to get out of your shell then you can
NkT28jang70,1285200,1291440,make that leap  i'm a big advocate of baby steps you're  not going to suddenly
NkT28jang70,1291440,1296559,transform yourself into bill clinton  overnight right right remember every  thousands of people's names and
NkT28jang70,1296559,1303840,yeah or suddenly become a great listener  so  every day you give yourself little tests
NkT28jang70,1303840,1310799,so you have now lunch with this person  who you normally find kind of boring  all right for ten minutes i'm gonna i'm
NkT28jang70,1310799,1316240,gonna shut off my internal model  and i'm gonna force myself to listen to  them and i'm gonna glean
NkT28jang70,1316240,1322080,some information some nugget about their  character that i never understood before  i'm going to ask them about their
NkT28jang70,1322080,1329600,childhood i'm not going to be  like cl it's it's not going to be that  kind of  inquisition where i'm asking them you
NkT28jang70,1329600,1335280,know penetrating questions  but in a relaxed mood i'm going to find  out about something that that really
NkT28jang70,1335280,1341840,motivates them or something deep or some  traumatic experience they had  you force yourself day by day to take
NkT28jang70,1341840,1347919,little baby steps in which you  try to learn something about people that  you didn't know before yeah and get
NkT28jang70,1347919,1355600,interested in them in their experiences  [Music]
NkT28jang70,1355600,1363039,what do you think is the greatest skill  or a couple skills that  any 20 to 30 year old kind of in their
NkT28jang70,1363039,1370400,20s should be learning how to master  today from the skills of psychology the
NkT28jang70,1370400,1375679,skills of human nature the skills of  understanding people which skill
NkT28jang70,1375679,1381600,should that be the the the best thing  is to be able to get inside the minds of
NkT28jang70,1381600,1388480,other people  if you develop that skill the sky's the  limit  nothing will ever stop you because
NkT28jang70,1388480,1395520,people are like a mystery they wear a  mask  and you don't have any idea what they're  thinking and i have this metaphor in
NkT28jang70,1395520,1400559,human nature which i never wrote but  imagine a device was created
NkT28jang70,1400559,1406320,in which some app that you could not  know the thoughts and feelings of the  other person
NkT28jang70,1406320,1411600,do you know the power you would have um  be insane  okay you're not i can't give you such an
NkT28jang70,1411600,1417440,app i can't invent that  but you can develop half of that power  by becoming
NkT28jang70,1417440,1423200,someone of insane empathy and  it's not easy and not everybody's born
NkT28jang70,1423200,1430880,the same way  but it begins with one very simple step  and that is normally you go around
NkT28jang70,1430880,1436000,more interested in your own thoughts and  ideas  you're thinking about your boss you're
NkT28jang70,1436000,1441039,thinking about your girlfriend or  boyfriend  you're thinking about this person who  said this that or the other and you're
NkT28jang70,1441039,1447039,locked in your head and it's like a  record like in the old final days going  around and round around the same grooves
NkT28jang70,1447039,1453200,right  and even when you're sitting there  talking with someone  on a date or something you're thinking
NkT28jang70,1453200,1458799,about yourself you're still in there  right  because you find yourself more
NkT28jang70,1458799,1464320,interesting than the other person  and it's very human and i'm not judging  it but inevitably you think your own
NkT28jang70,1464320,1470960,dramas your own ideas your own problems  are essentially more interesting than  the other person so if that's the that's
NkT28jang70,1470960,1477919,your starting position  you're naturally going to be more  absorbed in yourself  you can just switch it around and you
NkT28jang70,1477919,1483279,tell yourself  the other person is more interesting  than me their life
NkT28jang70,1483279,1488799,their thoughts their ideas it's like an  undiscovered world it's like
NkT28jang70,1488799,1494080,going to tahiti or something and  visiting another culture  they have experiences you've never had
NkT28jang70,1494080,1501200,they have a world  that's not your world it's fascinating  why do people love  movies they love movies because they get
NkT28jang70,1501200,1507039,to go inside other people's characters  and they get to vicariously live in them  it's voyeurism
NkT28jang70,1507039,1512400,you can have that in everyday life if  you switch that thing where you're more  interested in other people
NkT28jang70,1512400,1519440,and so when you listen to them you're  not listening with the idea of  do they like me are they thinking about
NkT28jang70,1519440,1525360,me what does it have to do with me i'm  sorry using that voice please  you know blah blah blah blah kind of a
NkT28jang70,1525360,1531760,windy voice what's it about me me me  thinking  just in a zen way absorb yourself in
NkT28jang70,1531760,1537440,their words and their energy  and think about what what they're saying  what's the subtext behind them
NkT28jang70,1537440,1544799,what's the body language revealing what  is it that motivates them what is their  inner  life like i can't get inside lewis
NkT28jang70,1544799,1551360,howe's thoughts it's impossible  but i can get inside your moods and  emotions because we humans are very
NkT28jang70,1551360,1558000,susceptible to the moods of other people  we can feel them  so i can start to if i'm open enough
NkT28jang70,1558000,1564559,i can understand the tone in your voice  i can understand the subtext of what  you're saying  and i could pick up the emotion behind
NkT28jang70,1564559,1571360,it and what you're intending  and once i do that well then  if someone says something i don't have
NkT28jang70,1571360,1577600,to take it personally  because now i understand that it  probably comes from  other things that have nothing to do
NkT28jang70,1577600,1582720,with me yeah or  i want them i want to persuade them to  help me on a project
NkT28jang70,1582720,1588720,well now i know what their world is like  what their spirit is what their problems  are  i'm going to mold what i'm saying to
NkT28jang70,1588720,1595600,plea to get them interested in my  idea doors open up to you left right  side the whole universe opens up to you
NkT28jang70,1595600,1601520,once you put you're able to put yourself  in the mindset  and the point of view of other people
NkT28jang70,1601520,1608159,enter their spirit  that's the single greatest step you can  have so  you're about to start your first job and
NkT28jang70,1608159,1614000,you're all insecure and you're all  worried about you and what people think  about you  try and make it's not easy it's not
NkT28jang70,1614000,1620000,natural try and make that switch  and don't think about yourself and try  and figure out what is your boss
NkT28jang70,1620000,1625039,like what is he or she what are they  what is motivating them what are their  insecurities what are their doubts
NkT28jang70,1625039,1630799,what is this person feeling that and  suddenly you're going to navigate this  social environment in a much different
NkT28jang70,1630799,1637120,level  i love this this is powerful i think so  to get in the minds of other people
NkT28jang70,1637120,1642320,would be the greatest skill  by far and the way to do that i'm  hearing you say is through empathy
NkT28jang70,1642320,1649360,through asking interesting questions  through listening  no it's taking this one step
NkT28jang70,1649360,1655840,which is other people are more  interesting than me  i love going to see movies that other
NkT28jang70,1655840,1663039,person  is like hannibal lecter i'm sorry that's  not that's not a good choice  sure could be but or they're like this
NkT28jang70,1663039,1668799,other character in some other movie i  don't know  choose whichever one you want right  beetlejuice
NkT28jang70,1668799,1674080,there you go okay wow that was a long  time ago yeah  i'm just thinking of a fascinating
NkT28jang70,1674080,1679520,character they're like that they have a  they have stories they have drama right
NkT28jang70,1679520,1686080,their childhood was probably weird they  come from a culture  from a city from a background that's not  your city or background
NkT28jang70,1686080,1692960,and to try and understand it now some  people are harder to do that with than  others  there are people out there who are like
NkT28jang70,1692960,1698559,just total  you don't really want to have to get  into the world right you feel like  you're getting yourself
NkT28jang70,1698559,1704159,taking a shower of mud or something or  excrement or whatever  you don't want to get into the world but
NkT28jang70,1704159,1710399,even then it pays  if you've got a psychotic boss it pays  to get inside their mind
NkT28jang70,1710399,1717840,so that you can don't take things  personally so you can understand where  they come from  so even with horrible people being able
NkT28jang70,1717840,1724960,to understand who they are  will will prevent you from taking  everything personally  so having the understanding that other
NkT28jang70,1724960,1730399,people are more interesting than me  having that framework in your mind  allows you to look at them differently
NkT28jang70,1730399,1736799,or as interesting right they have  stories to tell  they have a life that's that's  fascinating they're like a character in
NkT28jang70,1736799,1743279,the movie i want to understand it  and asking questions allows you to  understand it you have to be careful
NkT28jang70,1743279,1748640,with questions  because if you're so obvious if you're  going tell me about that
NkT28jang70,1748640,1755360,yeah so did you did you love your mother  did your father yeah  yeah yeah so how do we get to
NkT28jang70,1755360,1761600,know them without being intrusive well  it's an art so um
NkT28jang70,1761600,1769600,you know people love to talk about their  childhood  right and their successes and yeah yeah
NkT28jang70,1769600,1775039,but i found like childhood is the main  thing  everyone has this kind of emotional
NkT28jang70,1775039,1780320,attachment to their experiences as a  child to where they grew up  to their parents to their family to
NkT28jang70,1780320,1786880,their earliest friends  it's got all sorts of emotions  surrounding it that are very potent
NkT28jang70,1786880,1792240,and uncontrollable so  a very kind of slip in question about
NkT28jang70,1792240,1799039,someone's childhood  and then asking a few leading questions  and letting them do the talking
NkT28jang70,1799039,1804640,so if you're peppering them with  questions you look like a lawyer  or someone who's or someone like me who
NkT28jang70,1804640,1809840,just interviews people for a living  right so you want them to do 90 percent
NkT28jang70,1809840,1816240,of the  90 that it's obvious what you're doing  80  or so people love to talk right if they
NkT28jang70,1816240,1822000,do 70  of the talking they're not even aware  that they're doing that but you're  letting them talk you letting them be
NkT28jang70,1822000,1827760,the star but you find  a foothold into their what excites them
NkT28jang70,1827760,1832799,and you get them to talk and open up  about their childhood  and then occasionally a question and
NkT28jang70,1832799,1837840,then occasionally you go into your own  life  to sort of show oh yeah you had that i
NkT28jang70,1837840,1844080,had something very kind of similar  mirroring people is a slightly  manipulative trick i don't
NkT28jang70,1844080,1849279,adopt that and i talk about that in  seduction but it's very powerful  they start telling you things about
NkT28jang70,1849279,1856559,their childhood that are powerful you go  yeah i had something very similar and  you probably have had something similar  yeah that's a really potent way of
NkT28jang70,1856559,1862240,connecting to people  but you've got to be subtle it's an art  to getting people to talk and open up
NkT28jang70,1862240,1869600,to finding that thing that lights their  face up that gets them excited you know  mm-hmm yeah i think uh the book
NkT28jang70,1869600,1874640,influenced by  chaldini i don't know if you've studied  that book but just likeability allows  you to
NkT28jang70,1874640,1880480,is one of his main i think it's seven or  eight keys of influence but he talks  about  likability and the more someone can see
NkT28jang70,1880480,1885919,that they like you through mirroring or  through  yeah we have one thing in common makes  them like you more
NkT28jang70,1885919,1891760,so finding that commonality social proof  there's  like a bunch of other things i can't
NkT28jang70,1891760,1897360,remember all seven of them but  yeah likeability is one of the biggest  things it's one of the reasons why i'm
NkT28jang70,1897360,1902880,just always trying to have fun  and just be playful and kind of ease the  moment for people so they can feel like
NkT28jang70,1902880,1908640,oh this is  relaxing and fun and playful well i must  admit that's why you're a good  interviewer and i know that
NkT28jang70,1908640,1914320,because i've had i've been with many bad  interviewers  who are kind of tense and nervous and
NkT28jang70,1914320,1919600,defensive  and they're insecure right and they make  you feel that way
NkT28jang70,1919600,1925600,and you but you have an energy that kind  of brings out  that part of at least for me that's good
NkT28jang70,1925600,1930960,yeah that likes to yammer  how does someone not be insecure an
NkT28jang70,1930960,1936320,interviewer  a someone trying to get a job when  they're  doing an interview with their potential
NkT28jang70,1936320,1942159,boss when you're with someone who's  you're inspired by or higher status or
NkT28jang70,1942159,1949919,not on a  influenced position how do you not be  insecure or  nervous okay one simple answer
NkT28jang70,1949919,1956240,i mean there might be exceptions but  it's pretty simple  do your homework be prepared
NkT28jang70,1956240,1962000,so if you go into an interview you're  naturally nervous  but if you've prepared prepare the
NkT28jang70,1962000,1968000,out of it you research that person  you know who they are you know what the  company is like you know what the
NkT28jang70,1968000,1974080,position is  why the other person was fired what  they're going to need from you  you're going to feel a lot less insecure
NkT28jang70,1974080,1980080,and if you just kind of go in  and wing it right okay so if you're on  any kind of project
NkT28jang70,1980080,1986000,i talked in the war book about alfred  hitchcock  the film director and my wife is a film
NkT28jang70,1986000,1994240,director it's a nerve-wracking  task you've got an army of 80 people  who are all ge and insecure and ego
NkT28jang70,1994240,2000799,ridden  etc they're all secretly hoping you fail  so they can be the director yeah okay
NkT28jang70,2000799,2006880,it's a nightmare right  and hitchcock would like people were  astonished she'd be on the set
NkT28jang70,2006880,2011919,she'd be falling asleep oh oh really  okay yeah yeah go ahead
NkT28jang70,2011919,2017919,he was like buddha he didn't care he was  never upset or anything people  how could that be directors are the most
NkT28jang70,2017919,2023039,nervous  bitter people they're so control freaks  it's because he prepared
NkT28jang70,2023039,2028320,every detail he knew beforehand he knew  every shot that he wanted what the
NkT28jang70,2028320,2034159,clothes look like what the colors how  the framing would be  he's storyboarded in exact detail and he
NkT28jang70,2034159,2039279,said that by the time the film was being  shot  i was bored because i knew everything  that how it was supposed to be
NkT28jang70,2039279,2046000,so he could be calm because he was so  well prepared  so if you do your homework
NkT28jang70,2046000,2051599,it's maybe not going to get rid of all  your insecurities and all your  nervousness  because the degree of nervousness is
NkT28jang70,2051599,2057599,okay  because you have to understand the  physiology adrenaline is a very powerful
NkT28jang70,2057599,2063760,emotion  and feeling a little bit of doubt and a  little bit of fear  will drive you and keep your eye keep
NkT28jang70,2063760,2070560,you awake and alert  so you don't want to be so confident  that you'll just do anything  you want a little bit of tenseness yeah
NkT28jang70,2070560,2076079,but if you prepare  and you and you've anticipated the  situation
NkT28jang70,2076079,2082240,it will get rid of 80 of those doubts  that you have  we were talking about before and i have  a couple of questions for you we're
NkT28jang70,2082240,2089839,talking about before  self-doubt before we started recording  and  i'm curious your thoughts on doubt
NkT28jang70,2089839,2094878,doubting ourselves and how do we train  our minds or our bodies or our life
NkT28jang70,2094878,2100880,so that doubt doesn't keep us from  accomplishing with what we want or keep  us from trying something we want because
NkT28jang70,2100880,2107119,i think a lot of people don't do  something  because they doubt themselves so much  from the fear of failure or the fear of
NkT28jang70,2107119,2112320,success or people judging them  what's your thoughts on this well
NkT28jang70,2112320,2118480,the main thing is is you have to try  something you have to do  something right and of course if you're
NkT28jang70,2118480,2126079,full of doubt  and insecurities it's going to be very  hard  and so what separates the person who
NkT28jang70,2126079,2132560,is going to learn is on the way to  success from somebody who won't  will be that person who's 22 23 they
NkT28jang70,2132560,2139440,tries it they do it  they take that job and they write that  thing or they do that  whatever it is that the other person
NkT28jang70,2139440,2146240,maybe wouldn't try  because they're not afraid of failing  right so  a certain level of you can't control
NkT28jang70,2146240,2152640,that because some people  are born that way i don't know if  they're born that way but something  about them in their dna
NkT28jang70,2152640,2158160,has given them that drive but if you  don't have that drive if you have your  insecurities
NkT28jang70,2158160,2166400,understand pain is a very powerful  motivating factor  but if you're 22 and you don't try
NkT28jang70,2166400,2172160,something you don't feel the pain  so why not and then you're 23 then  you're 24 you're not 15. then you're 28
NkT28jang70,2172160,2178160,you're still not feeling  then you're 32 you're starting to feel a  little depressed and you're 35  man and you're 40 you're picking up the
NkT28jang70,2178160,2183440,bottle you know  okay so understand that you're 22 that  life is
NkT28jang70,2183440,2189440,very difficult and that you're gonna  you're done a path towards  something really really bad unless you
NkT28jang70,2189440,2197520,get your act together and try that first  thing  because what happens people have studied  fear and it's very important and i know
NkT28jang70,2197520,2203839,back in 2001 i was in vienna austria  and i was watching i was in a theater i
NkT28jang70,2203839,2210800,was in the middle of this  this very packed audience and there was  a fire  and people were panicking and running
NkT28jang70,2210800,2216400,around and i got  such a sense of claustrophobia it killed  i was like aha
NkT28jang70,2216400,2221839,and from then on i couldn't get on an  airplane i couldn't get in an elevator  i was like developing major
NkT28jang70,2221839,2227280,claustrophobia right  and then i went i saw a therapist and  she said
NkT28jang70,2227280,2234320,you got to expose yourself you got to go  back in that elevator that's so true you  got to go  back into that airplane and then you
NkT28jang70,2234320,2239839,realize it's not so bad and you'll get  over it  but avoiding it you'll never get over  the fear so
NkT28jang70,2239839,2246720,take that first step do whatever it is  that you thought you couldn't do  and don't be afraid because that is the
NkT28jang70,2246720,2252320,most important moment in your life  and then you realize it's not so bad
NkT28jang70,2252320,2258160,okay people are making fun of me i  failed but they never tried anything i  at least tried it and i have an idea for
NkT28jang70,2258160,2263760,my next but it wasn't so bad  you know but if you never make that  first step
NkT28jang70,2263760,2269280,i don't care the wisdom of solomon won't  be able to help you  right you'll always be stopping before
NkT28jang70,2269280,2275520,you can so you've got to be have the  guts  to make that first step and then the  doors will open for you
NkT28jang70,2275520,2281599,it's what i'm hearing you say is it's an  experiential event it's not a  theory of okay let me think my way out
NkT28jang70,2281599,2287040,of the fear the insecurity of the doubt  it's like no i have to practice this and  experience the feeling of
NkT28jang70,2287040,2292800,i failed or someone laughed at me or i  tripped and fell whatever it is  you've got to experience it you have a
NkT28jang70,2292800,2300240,good way of summarizing what i'm saying  because you said it better than i did  well this is something i've been  fascinated by because i think
NkT28jang70,2300240,2305920,so many people are doubt themselves  and their doubt is what keeps them from
NkT28jang70,2305920,2311440,going after what they want  getting into the relationship they want  getting out of the relationship they  want you know getting the job all these
NkT28jang70,2311440,2317119,things  and they're afraid of failure they're  afraid of success and they're afraid of
NkT28jang70,2317119,2322240,people's opinions or judgment  when they take this action and i i tell
NkT28jang70,2322240,2327280,people that the simplest thing you can  do is write a list of your biggest fears  and insecurities
NkT28jang70,2327280,2333040,circle the top one the one that scares  you the most and then do that until you  feel  at peace with it or at least so you can
NkT28jang70,2333040,2339280,embrace it essentially become batman of  that fear right  and live with the bats of that fear that  insecurity
NkT28jang70,2339280,2344480,where then it becomes a powerful thing  for you and this is what i did in my  teens and 20s from
NkT28jang70,2344480,2350240,being terrified of public speaking and i  went to public squeezing class  every single week until i felt like wow
NkT28jang70,2350240,2356160,i feel powerful up here not powerless  right and i did it with so many  different things that i was insecure
NkT28jang70,2356160,2363200,about  until they became skills as opposed to  fears and insecurities i think and so i
NkT28jang70,2363200,2368800,love that you said you've got to expose  yourself to the fear you've got to re-go  into the elevator  go back to that theater that had the
NkT28jang70,2368800,2375359,fire right and  breathe and feel comfortable so you can  live your life  and then we go back to the thought about
NkT28jang70,2375359,2381359,you know that question could it have  been worse  yeah well think of it this way
NkT28jang70,2381359,2386560,if you don't try that thing it's going  to be a lot worse for you down the road
NkT28jang70,2386560,2393119,you're going to never get anywhere and  and you're going to  the pain will be intense in 15 years
NkT28jang70,2393119,2398880,you're not feeling it now  but have that hindsight to realize that  the worst thing in life
NkT28jang70,2398880,2405200,the worst feeling of all is to see that  you wasted your potential  that you had dreams and you never even
NkT28jang70,2405200,2411119,tried them  and then you're in your 50s your 60s  you're facing death  why was i alive i didn't do it i could
NkT28jang70,2411119,2417359,have done this that or that never even  tried  remind yourself of that you know they
NkT28jang70,2417359,2424000,used to have  emperors in in ancient rome would have a  slave  walking by them and whispering into
NkT28jang70,2424000,2430000,their ear you're going to die you're  immortal  you might die tomorrow you might die  tomorrow right
NkT28jang70,2430000,2435680,and that was like a reminder of their  mortality and they had to not get so
NkT28jang70,2435680,2441280,up wasn't wasn't that a story from  marcus aurelius where he had someone  talk to him and say you're just a man or
NkT28jang70,2441280,2446640,something or might be  was that who was i can't remember but  someone had someone just say every day  you're just a man
NkT28jang70,2446640,2451680,right the more powerful he became yeah  to kind of  keep him more grounded right you're just
NkT28jang70,2451680,2457839,a man or you're going to die  or just have that whisper you're going  to fail you're going to you're going to  be you're not going to realize your
NkT28jang70,2457839,2463359,dreams you're going to waste your life  you're wasting your life you're wasting  your life you're wasting your life
NkT28jang70,2463359,2470079,you don't want to feel that way i know  like  it's hard it's i'm coming from a
NkT28jang70,2470079,2475760,position of privilege and i don't deny  that  sure but i was not i didn't have anybody
NkT28jang70,2475760,2482560,help me i all my success was pretty much  on my own i worked really hard  but i can tell you this that prior to my
NkT28jang70,2482560,2488720,success  i was really unhappy i was really  unhappy i was very depressed i even had
NkT28jang70,2488720,2493760,moments i was suicidal  i felt like i could do something but i  wasn't able to do it
NkT28jang70,2493760,2499680,and then the ability to like write my  books now  i don't have that feeling anymore and
NkT28jang70,2499680,2505040,it's the greatest thing in the world  to not ever feel like you know that
NkT28jang70,2505040,2511920,that doubt and that depression it's like  a constant exhilaration it's amazing  i i finished it i wrote that book i did
NkT28jang70,2511920,2517599,it you know i  i can feel good about myself and i want  other people to understand that
NkT28jang70,2517599,2524319,you may not it doesn't have to be a  grand project  but it has to be something that makes  you feel like
NkT28jang70,2524319,2530960,you know because when you're a child you  have these dreams everybody had these  dreams  you're going to be the best basketball
NkT28jang70,2530960,2536319,player in history like me like i thought  i was  right you know a jewish kid's gonna be a
NkT28jang70,2536319,2541680,great basketball player  okay you know or i'm gonna be the best  this i'm gonna be a great writer would  be the
NkT28jang70,2541680,2547760,blah and then you get older and you lose  those dreams and it's very depressing  it's very debilitating
NkT28jang70,2547760,2555119,and you want to keep some of that child  within you alive  and some of that ambition some of that  desire to achieve something great
NkT28jang70,2555119,2561599,and having ambition is not a bad thing  it's a dirty word today because people  think it means you're selfish
NkT28jang70,2561599,2566640,but your ambitions can be towards  achieving things that help people as  well
NkT28jang70,2566640,2572480,what's the greatest fear for you now  that you haven't yet  conquered or overcome or insecurity that
NkT28jang70,2572480,2579599,you're still  dealing with i don't know lois
NkT28jang70,2579599,2586079,you know um i i haven't believe it or  not  a tremendous fear of failure
NkT28jang70,2586079,2591359,like um still after all these massive  hits and millions of book souls and  every time you get a
NkT28jang70,2591359,2598400,i'm neurotic and i don't do that every  every book is a hit and just  changes lives well it's because
NkT28jang70,2598400,2606560,i don't know it's from my background i  come home with straight a's and my  parents would go  okay so what what's next okay
NkT28jang70,2606560,2611839,so it's instilled in me some way i don't  know why but  so i'm writing my new book my first
NkT28jang70,2611839,2617440,chapter and i'm going this isn't working  it's it's too intellectual it's not  going to hit people it's not relevant to
NkT28jang70,2617440,2622720,their lives  i have to change it i have to change it  if i write the book like this people are  going to laugh at me
NkT28jang70,2622720,2627839,and i go through that every single time  in every single book  now i'm able it's kind of a split
NkT28jang70,2627839,2633920,personality because in the back of my  mind i know i'm kind of playing a game  but i still play the game and it keeps
NkT28jang70,2633920,2640400,me motivating it keeps me working  so i must say i'm still deathly afraid  of failing my readers
NkT28jang70,2640400,2645520,and of them being disappointed in me and  going i thought robert was this great  writer and look he's put out this
NkT28jang70,2645520,2650740,man what's wrong with him he's getting  old and soft i'm still afraid of that
NkT28jang70,2650740,2658480,[Music]  how do you manifest and attract a
NkT28jang70,2658480,2664880,partner that you want to be with that  has  those three keys the the connection the  attraction and the balance
NkT28jang70,2664880,2672079,that you feel like is the one could be  one of the ones  how do you set yourself up to attract
NkT28jang70,2672079,2677280,that incredible partner  so one you got to be yourself so finding  yourself
NkT28jang70,2677280,2684640,is number one all right you can't  connect with someone if they're  connecting with the fake you  all right that's a false connection so
NkT28jang70,2684640,2690960,you have to discover who you are become  confident in that  stand strong in it now who is drawn to
NkT28jang70,2690960,2696240,that person  you know it's real all right and so  that's where we begin
NkT28jang70,2696240,2702960,two you need to exude positive  energy all right to me
NkT28jang70,2702960,2710000,and this is i think this is very  important for women all right  because the reality is that it's
NkT28jang70,2710000,2717599,men or the type of men that a lot of  women want aren't going to be drawn to a  negative woman no  there's millions of good women but that
NkT28jang70,2717599,2723200,doesn't mean they're  positive women all right and it's that  lack of positive energy that holds them
NkT28jang70,2723200,2728800,back more than they realize  yes and just like even just saying  negative things throughout the day
NkT28jang70,2728800,2734240,they might be a good person but if  they're always complaining or negative  exactly and not even just what they say
NkT28jang70,2734240,2740000,again it's how they're coming off  because their energy  their body language yes it's like so
NkT28jang70,2740000,2745200,look at it like this i tell people all  the time it's not what you say is how  you make them feel  all right so you can say all the
NkT28jang70,2745200,2750720,wonderful things you want but if in your  presence they don't feel at ease they  don't feel peace they don't feel that  positivity
NkT28jang70,2750720,2757839,that's still going to throw everything  off if you say nice things but you have  a frown  exactly what's the point exactly exactly
NkT28jang70,2757839,2763760,and what  what a lot of women aren't realizing is  that their energy is off because they  have walls up
NkT28jang70,2763760,2770319,they're so scared they're so uh fixated  on protecting themselves because  they've been hurt in the past exactly
NkT28jang70,2770319,2775839,having healed from those things but i  tell people all the time  the same walls give up to protect you  are the same walls blocking your
NkT28jang70,2775839,2781119,blessings  all right so you don't realize you're  restricting your ability to love and be
NkT28jang70,2781119,2786400,loved because you're walking fear all  right  you can't walk in fear and expect all
NkT28jang70,2786400,2792000,these wonderful things to happen it  doesn't work that way  even in business the ones who succeed
NkT28jang70,2792000,2797040,are the ones who put the fear aside and  say i'm gonna have faith and push  forward no matter what no matter how it
NkT28jang70,2797040,2804400,looks in front of me  no matter how many people tell me you're  doing the wrong thing  get a regular job whatever no you
NkT28jang70,2804400,2810000,believe what you need to do and you push  forward past that fear it's the same  thing with relationships
NkT28jang70,2810000,2815440,you have to push forward in faith not  fear if you want to receive that great  relationship
NkT28jang70,2815440,2820800,and so yes this can happen with men as  well i don't want men thinking they can  carry around much of negative energy  and they're going to get a great
NkT28jang70,2820800,2826000,relationship but i do think it shoots  women in the foot  more because here's the other thing that
NkT28jang70,2826000,2832319,people don't talk about a lot and some  people may not like this i'm just going  to keep it real yeah for sure  it pulls women away from their feminine
NkT28jang70,2832319,2839280,energy and  they're not positive when they're not  positive and when they're holding on to  these fears and have these walls up
NkT28jang70,2839280,2844960,and it's the feminine energy that makes  the woman so powerful  that is what that's the tool that is at
NkT28jang70,2844960,2850720,her disposal that  can make the world her oyster all right  but women have become very detached from
NkT28jang70,2850720,2856880,their femininity and the thing is this  if you  a lot of them will say they're not  feminine they're just not that way i
NkT28jang70,2856880,2862880,dispute that in most situations no you  become detached from it you become  uncomfortable with it due to again a
NkT28jang70,2862880,2869920,lack of healing  and due to experiences in your life now  if you are  more masculine so to speak and you are
NkT28jang70,2869920,2875200,happy that way that by all means  continue to live your life as you are  but
NkT28jang70,2875200,2881680,if you're not seeing things work for the  way that you want them to  and you're in that energy that more
NkT28jang70,2881680,2887760,masculine energy or more further away  from your feminine  then consider making a switch consider  at least trying it
NkT28jang70,2887760,2893680,yeah see the difference and what i found  with a lot of women is that not only is  it beneficial to them as far as
NkT28jang70,2893680,2901359,uh relationships wise it's beneficial in  the quality of their life for their  health  their health their peace their work
NkT28jang70,2901359,2906720,you name it i have a client she's a a  doctor at a big hospital  and when she came to me she was
NkT28jang70,2906720,2912839,frustrated with relationships ready to  give up on men  nobody liked her at work she was just a  hard tough
NkT28jang70,2912839,2918319,manager so we worked on her energy we  worked on healing  we got her energy we got her to embrace
NkT28jang70,2918319,2923359,more feminine energy  she would swear by it right now in one  month
NkT28jang70,2923359,2929440,her whole hospital started to love her  wow now they're all helpful  whether they were women or men men
NkT28jang70,2929440,2937359,started coming out the woodworks  all right let me get your number girl at  you girl  yeah she ended up meeting her soon-to-be
NkT28jang70,2937359,2942480,fiance  on the airplane two months after we  started doing the coaching
NkT28jang70,2942480,2948160,so what were the shifts that she made  every single day  like what was the things that she said  okay i'm gonna not be this way i'm gonna
NkT28jang70,2948160,2954240,start trying this  it was just it was one being more  conscious of your energy i think number  one  we have to be mindful of the energy
NkT28jang70,2954240,2959440,we're giving off we become so  distracted by our issues that we're  facing in the world
NkT28jang70,2959440,2965200,by our responsibilities we're not always  in tune with  what we're giving off so to give an
NkT28jang70,2965200,2970640,example and this is just a small one  even for me as a man i work out a lot  when i come out the gym
NkT28jang70,2970640,2977280,i started to notice i'm very tense my  face is you know hard exactly  so i've learned to when i walk out the
NkT28jang70,2977280,2983359,gym take a deep breath  relax the body relax the muscles and the  energy completely changes
NkT28jang70,2983359,2989760,all right because yes you can become  very intimidating as a man  just like you can become very  intimidating as a woman and so you have
NkT28jang70,2989760,2995760,to be mindful of  are you making yourself more  approachable are you allowing  people to feel more comfortable being
NkT28jang70,2995760,3002559,around you and so that starts with  being mindful of it being conscious of  it and one great way to do that is
NkT28jang70,3002559,3007599,get an accountability partner all right  absolutely tell someone who  who has the ability to be positive
NkT28jang70,3007599,3013440,because you don't want to pick a  negative person to be your  accountability partner it's gonna throw  everything off  but you pick a positive person and you
NkT28jang70,3013440,3020319,say hey listen whenever i'm being  negative whenever i'm giving that bad  energy  let me know because now when they tell
NkT28jang70,3020319,3026000,you you won't always realize when you're  doing it at least not at first  but once they start calling you out now
NkT28jang70,3026000,3031280,you become more mindful of it  now you can take hold of it and control  it and now you
NkT28jang70,3031280,3038640,master what energy you're giving off at  certain times  and that changes everything wow
NkT28jang70,3038640,3044400,when someone feels like they found the  one  and i've heard this a lot like i know
NkT28jang70,3044400,3050400,this is the one i  or i thought they were the one and then  it didn't end up working out
NkT28jang70,3050400,3056000,and they want to get married they've  decided marriage is for them they want  to be life partners
NkT28jang70,3056000,3062559,what are a few of the conversations that  they should have  to not know for certain but know for
NkT28jang70,3062559,3068880,better certain that this is the right  decision this partnership  is the right decision to move forward in  a long long-term committed relationship
NkT28jang70,3068880,3076160,as opposed to just maybe the infatuation  behind it or the initial connection or  the  attraction what are a few questions they
NkT28jang70,3076160,3081520,should be  asking each other that maybe they  haven't asked yet  to know whether or not they're setting
NkT28jang70,3081520,3087440,themselves up for that  successful long-term relationship okay  number one
NkT28jang70,3087440,3094559,how do you envision your role in  marriage  all right people don't go in finding out
NkT28jang70,3094559,3099599,what the expectations are before they  get married they have this assumption  that
NkT28jang70,3099599,3105599,we're just going to transition from how  we are in a relationship  to being that way in america no no no no
NkT28jang70,3105599,3112640,no  because a lot of times things change  and and the level of expectation raises
NkT28jang70,3112640,3120559,now in marriage you also have some  people who may think  for example you may have a man out there  who thinks okay my job is to court you
NkT28jang70,3120559,3126400,when we're boyfriend and girlfriend when  we're married when we're married i'm  gonna do all that work anymore  now i'm your husband i've given you the
NkT28jang70,3126400,3131680,ring satisfy me make me happy  you gotta find that out because you're  setting yourself up for failure if you
NkT28jang70,3131680,3137599,don't realize  he thinks he gets to take time off now  that he's married you  or he may think as long as i'm paying
NkT28jang70,3137599,3142800,these bills  don't ask me for anything else you got  to find out so we need to ask
NkT28jang70,3142800,3148079,what do you should be asking that yeah  both of them should be asking what how  do you perceive your role in marriage
NkT28jang70,3148079,3154480,what are your expectations from me in  marriage let's find out what we need  what we're expecting from each other
NkT28jang70,3154480,3161359,number two making sure our values  are aligned all right so whether that be
NkT28jang70,3161359,3168480,spiritual  whether that be even financial values  whatever those things  are let's make sure we're on the same
NkT28jang70,3168480,3176000,page about it  and if we're not in the same page are  these things we can balance out and work  out  all right so for example if let's look
NkT28jang70,3176000,3182480,at it from a financial perspective  if i'm a very frugal man yes and this  woman is a spender  [Laughter]
NkT28jang70,3182480,3189359,i have friends in this situation and  it's not good exactly  and i'm sure they may talk about it in  advance you want to talk about these
NkT28jang70,3189359,3195440,things and say okay  how do we view this what are your what  are your expectations as a spender are  you someone who thinks well i gotta be
NkT28jang70,3195440,3201440,able to spend some free money every  month yeah i gotta go shopping every  month  what is it let's come to an agreement
NkT28jang70,3201440,3206960,beforehand that we're both comfortable  with but let's  understand what we're walking into here
NkT28jang70,3206960,3212160,all right again we don't talk about  these things we just assume  oh because she's not asking for money
NkT28jang70,3212160,3218480,now she won't ask for money later  and that's not necessarily true right  let's find out what are we expecting
NkT28jang70,3218480,3224160,do our values align in marriage um  i definitely think number three sexual
NkT28jang70,3224160,3229760,expectations  i think that needs to be discussed and  understood um
NkT28jang70,3229760,3235920,and again it's all about compromise if a  compromise can't be found so it's not  saying  okay well i expect it four times a week
NkT28jang70,3235920,3241359,right you know he or she says two times  a week and now we're just going at it no  well then maybe we go with three times a
NkT28jang70,3241359,3247119,week  yeah but we make sure the compromise is  something that we can both be happy with  don't  when you compromise on something that
NkT28jang70,3247119,3252559,you're not gonna be happy about you're  not compromising you're sacrificing  and those sacrifice can be good in some
NkT28jang70,3252559,3258640,instances  not when it's very important to you or  it's going to be important enough that  it would cause you to
NkT28jang70,3258640,3264160,wander if you're not getting it never  sacrifice something that's going to make  you want to look at someone else in your
NkT28jang70,3264160,3269280,marriage  all right so if you need three times a  week to be happy and satisfied
NkT28jang70,3269280,3275119,make that very clear don't agree to two  yeah  and then yeah exactly and now you're
NkT28jang70,3275119,3282000,entertaining other people because you  never set that expectation  another expectation as we talked about  earlier with attraction
NkT28jang70,3282000,3287760,is how we keep ourselves up physically i  do think what if i just gained  60 pounds in seven years and is that
NkT28jang70,3287760,3293119,okay since we're married now  listen people need to be honest so like  i tell some men
NkT28jang70,3293119,3299119,if you can say you know what if my wife  gains 60 pounds  i don't care i'm cool with it and you're
NkT28jang70,3299119,3304480,going to love it with the same  energy and desire that you did 60 other  pounds ago
NkT28jang70,3304480,3311440,great but if you can't maintain that  desire  that passion 60 pounds left you need to
NkT28jang70,3311440,3318960,make that known  now you can't be afraid to say well that  sounds too shallow  oh so would we rather be shallow now or
NkT28jang70,3318960,3324960,have a disastrous relationship later  have you cheating on your partner  because you weren't willing to be honest
NkT28jang70,3324960,3330079,in the beginning  all right same and women too because the  epidemic that's happening is
NkT28jang70,3330079,3337280,women are less honest about their  attraction needs  so to speak all right really so whenever
NkT28jang70,3337280,3345680,we talk about attraction letting  yourself go i think people automatically  think of the woman letting themselves go  but a lot of men have let themselves go
NkT28jang70,3345680,3352559,and have fallen far from what he looked  like when they first got married  but she's not always being as honest and
NkT28jang70,3352559,3359200,straightforward about that  one reason may be because she doesn't  want the pressure on her  so that's that's one issue right there
NkT28jang70,3359200,3365119,or she may be afraid of his ego  and and think it's too her agile exactly  and doesn't want to say anything
NkT28jang70,3365119,3372000,but again if you can't maintain the same  passion and desire with that fall off
NkT28jang70,3372000,3378160,you've got to be honest about that so he  understands  because what happens is this so let's  just use this example
NkT28jang70,3378160,3383520,he lets himself go he lets himself go  the sex falls off all right  and the sexes fall off because she's not
NkT28jang70,3383520,3390400,as attracted to him anymore but she's  not being honest about it  now when she does say anything about
NkT28jang70,3390400,3396000,whether it's his weight or whatever the  case may be he's gonna think you're just  making excuses
NkT28jang70,3396000,3402000,you're just trying to give a reason not  to have sex rather than embracing it as  this is the reality of what's holding us
NkT28jang70,3402000,3407839,back  however if we had this conversation from  the jump and you were honest about this  then i always
NkT28jang70,3407839,3414400,knew this would be an issue now when you  bring it back up it's gonna be like yeah  you did tell me  wow it just happened so now it's gonna
NkT28jang70,3414400,3419520,be easier for me to  embrace that and actually do something  about it and have the recognition and
NkT28jang70,3419520,3425119,awareness about it because you'd already  talked about it  exactly you do a lot of these events and  workshops for
NkT28jang70,3425119,3430480,you know hundreds of women at a time are  women opening up in these experiences  when you're
NkT28jang70,3430480,3437040,connecting with them and saying yes i do  lose the attraction  like appearances are important to me or
NkT28jang70,3437040,3442160,or is it not as important and you're  from the events that you've done with  the women you've talked to
NkT28jang70,3442160,3448720,what is the feedback on appearance and  looks  so i will say this when it comes to  appearance looks
NkT28jang70,3448720,3454240,and sex women aren't as vocal and  transparent  in a group of people really yeah but
NkT28jang70,3454240,3459839,one-on-one with you one-on-one  different story so same thing like using  the sex example if i ask
NkT28jang70,3459839,3466000,a group of women are you getting orgasms  regularly  there's going to be women in there who  lie because they don't want to feel
NkT28jang70,3466000,3471760,inadequate they don't want to be the  woman who doesn't raise their hand and  say yes i'm giving it good  so they're going to be hesitant or not
NkT28jang70,3471760,3476960,know how to answer it but if i ask in  private now i'm going to get mixed real
NkT28jang70,3476960,3483200,truth yes  and now she's going to be very clear  about loss of attraction  lack of sexual satisfaction and all
NkT28jang70,3483200,3489040,these things so that's why people have  to be careful because i think sometimes  we're assuming these issues don't really
NkT28jang70,3489040,3495680,exist because we're not hearing it in  that group setting  don't be fooled some women just they  feel more comfortable privately
NkT28jang70,3495680,3502240,expressing those things  and i've heard it enough times to know  this is real  and again you just have to even if you
NkT28jang70,3502240,3507760,haven't heard it enough times pay  attention  there's a reason why we're seeing people  fall off in marriage there's a reason
NkT28jang70,3507760,3512960,why we're seeing this disconnect  and even when it comes to infidelity  there's a great focus on men who've
NkT28jang70,3512960,3521200,cheated but there's a lot of women  who've cheated a lot of women and it's  not always for emotional reasons  it's for sexual ones too so again my my
NkT28jang70,3521200,3526799,thing is not to sit here and say well  it's about  who does work it's about okay how do we  fix this how do we make this better and
NkT28jang70,3526799,3531920,we have to accept that yes  there are contributing factors to why we  see failed marriages
NkT28jang70,3531920,3537760,why we see infidelity why we see  disconnects in our relationships  let's address the underlying issues and
NkT28jang70,3537760,3544400,be honest about it so we can get this on  the right track wow  are there any um relationships
NkT28jang70,3544400,3549760,that you're aware of that uh  have open relationships that are
NkT28jang70,3549760,3555200,successful or do you think it's  very hard because more and more with the  burning man seeing you and all these
NkT28jang70,3555200,3561040,people exploring these things  what's your thoughts on you know open  relationships or
NkT28jang70,3561040,3568480,you know being together but also having  multiple partners so i'm gonna be honest  um i i'm very skeptical of open
NkT28jang70,3568480,3574799,relationships  now i don't want to sit here and say  it's impossible for it to be successful  because i haven't met everybody and
NkT28jang70,3574799,3581599,i haven't studied it enough but i have  studied it to a certain extent  and from what i have found is again a
NkT28jang70,3581599,3587520,lot of open relationships stemmed from  one the perception that one person can't
NkT28jang70,3587520,3595200,fulfill me  and since one person can't fulfill me  why not have more than one  all right and to me find the person
NkT28jang70,3595200,3601760,who's experienced that deep and genuine  connection  they don't have that perception because  they had a moment in their life where
NkT28jang70,3601760,3607920,they met someone that they thought  this could be it i could put my all into  this and i would be happy with this one
NkT28jang70,3607920,3614480,person  if you haven't experienced that  connection of course  there's a natural progression to
NkT28jang70,3614480,3620880,thinking well maybe it's not going to  work with just one  can i entertain multiple if i can even  handle multiple
NkT28jang70,3620880,3626720,the other thing is i do think it also  stems from a lack of  successful monogamy and when i say a
NkT28jang70,3626720,3632480,lack of successful monogamy  i don't necessarily mean that they  weren't able to maintain monogamy it's  like okay if i get in this monogamous
NkT28jang70,3632480,3638000,relationship and now i get cheated on  or i've had multiple relations where  i've been cheated on i may start to
NkT28jang70,3638000,3644160,think what's the point of trying to be  monogamous  anyways exactly why not just get an open
NkT28jang70,3644160,3651040,relationship  which one allows me to not be so  vulnerable to one person  i now have more emotional control and
NkT28jang70,3651040,3658400,what you'll find in a lot of situations  is there's still somebody running that  show and what i mean by that is one of
NkT28jang70,3658400,3665359,the people are running a show  exactly and they're running it in a way  that it's protecting  them all right so i met a woman one time
NkT28jang70,3665359,3670559,she was into polyamory  and she said well her ideal polyamorous  relationship was a man
NkT28jang70,3670559,3676960,and a woman but they're not allowed to  have other people  all right so it's like you're trying to  control this environment
NkT28jang70,3676960,3684480,for your sake all right for your  protection so that means there's  something  deeper going on here so to me i
NkT28jang70,3684480,3690720,i just tell people when it comes to open  relationships if you really believe  that's your thing  fine i'm not here to tell people that
NkT28jang70,3690720,3696160,they can't live their life that way  but i just want you to make sure you've  healed from everything first
NkT28jang70,3696160,3702079,if you heal from everything and you  still feel like this is for you  do your thing do your thing but you
NkT28jang70,3702079,3708480,might be surprised what's going to  happen  when you uncover it and address some of  these past traumas and issues
NkT28jang70,3708480,3715039,you may not be so so inclined to want to  be in this open relationship anymore  and again i would still argue that if
NkT28jang70,3715039,3721200,you meet that person you have that  amazing connection with  it changes the game right and it will it
NkT28jang70,3721200,3728079,can completely throw you for a loop  because i've seen people who were once  into over relationships and completely
NkT28jang70,3728079,3735119,shipped to monogamy because  they met that person it was like i never  thought this could happen but  it's here and i want it i'm going for it
NkT28jang70,3735119,3741119,wow  that's powerful insight what about
NkT28jang70,3741119,3746160,in a relationship that's you've been  together for a long time  we've been married together for a long
NkT28jang70,3746160,3752400,time and it just feels like  it's not working and you're talking  about divorce
NkT28jang70,3752400,3759440,and both of you aren't happy you've got  the kids you've got the home you've got  the lives together
NkT28jang70,3759520,3765440,and both of you aren't happy right and  you've like addressed this and talked  about it  you've tried different things they
NkT28jang70,3765440,3772960,haven't worked maybe is there a way to  rekindle those three things  and find that connection again maybe
NkT28jang70,3772960,3778079,maybe you've lost  that attraction and that balance uh is  that even possible
NkT28jang70,3778079,3784319,in these times or  is divorce the only way to try
NkT28jang70,3784319,3790079,to then go find true happiness or  connection somewhere else  if a true connection ever existed in
NkT28jang70,3790079,3796960,that relationship  then it can be fixed but that's the key  did it ever really  exist and we've got to examine that
NkT28jang70,3796960,3802079,because again yeah many people have been  living off the fantasy of their  perception of things
NkT28jang70,3802079,3808480,what they wanted to believe it was and  and wanted to hold on to this feeling of  being in love but in reality they were
NkT28jang70,3808480,3813680,involved in an unhealthy attachment to  this individual  so we have to go deeper and find out is
NkT28jang70,3813680,3820000,that there so if the  connection was there yes we can work on  everything else  we can get things on track it's going to
NkT28jang70,3820000,3825119,cause it's going to create a lot of uh  deeper emotional discovery so to speak
NkT28jang70,3825119,3832400,as far as finding out okay  why is there a disconnect now how do we  fall off of track  how can we now correct these specific
NkT28jang70,3832400,3837599,things because there's very specific  things that need to change  are we both willing to put in that work
NkT28jang70,3837599,3844640,all right and if  if both sides are willing to do that  then it absolutely can work  now if there was no connection you had
NkT28jang70,3844640,3850640,divorce  you get a divorce yeah divorce sooner or  later  i'm a man of god and i would love for
NkT28jang70,3850640,3858160,everyone to be able to stay  married right but even when people have  been  convinced that you get married you stay
NkT28jang70,3858160,3863359,married forever  this even if it's a religious thing or  you feel like the pressure of society
NkT28jang70,3863359,3869440,like here's why despite those things you  don't stay married  especially when you have kids so so many
NkT28jang70,3869440,3875440,people stay married because of the kids  right  but if you can't create a positive  environment at home
NkT28jang70,3875440,3882079,you are damaging the kids worse than you  would in divorce  divorce isn't in my opinion the greatest
NkT28jang70,3882079,3888559,struggle for the child  it's the it's lacking the understanding  of what just happened here  so if you've been feeding your kids all
NkT28jang70,3888559,3893760,these years that mommy and daddy love  each other and everything's all good  despite our this moment why are we gonna
NkT28jang70,3893760,3899599,exactly so now one day you wake up we're  getting divorced the child is confused  and the thing is we're not honest with
NkT28jang70,3899599,3905359,the kids about why this happened  what went wrong we're not saying yeah  you know what we knew a long time ago we
NkT28jang70,3905359,3911359,weren't best for each other  we're not giving them the honest truth  for them to learn  and not make the same mistakes repeating
NkT28jang70,3911359,3917200,their pattern exactly what the child now  thinks is you can't trust love  wow you can't trust marriage because you
NkT28jang70,3917200,3923039,can love each other and one day now it's  over  and now they become dysfunctional or  they now have dysfunctional relations
NkT28jang70,3923039,3929520,because of their skewed perception of  things  because they lack clarity in  understanding what just happened here
NkT28jang70,3929520,3934640,but going back to divorce versus staying  together  again what a child needs more than
NkT28jang70,3934640,3939760,anything is a positive loving  environment  if you can achieve that together great
NkT28jang70,3939760,3946559,if you can't you are better off apart  wow because when you speak to adults now  adults who are struggling today
NkT28jang70,3946559,3952319,grew up in dysfunctional households and  it didn't matter if it was a  one parent or two parent household i
NkT28jang70,3952319,3958240,felt eventually exactly dysfunction is  dysfunction  yeah and we pick up on these things no  one is that great of an
NkT28jang70,3958240,3965119,actor that they're hiding it from their  child the child  sees the problems and then
NkT28jang70,3965119,3970480,you don't even realize you neglect the  child in certain ways because you're  dwelling in your own
NkT28jang70,3970480,3976880,issues your own uh struggle there are  women right now who have mommy issues or  they have what i call i don't want to be
NkT28jang70,3976880,3982319,my mother syndrome  when they saw their mother allow herself  to be treated poorly
NkT28jang70,3982319,3988720,abused suffered through a horrible  marriage and the woman is like  i don't want to ever be that and now
NkT28jang70,3988720,3995599,because she's holding on to that  she either becomes her mother or creates  other issues not trying to be her
NkT28jang70,3995599,4001119,all right so it still creates a negative  cycle of dysfunctional relationships
NkT28jang70,4001119,4006400,all stemming from we stayed longer than  we should have  we try to hold on to something that we
NkT28jang70,4006400,4011839,can't work my thing is this even for  those who are spiritual if you're gonna  say  we're not supposed to get divorced
NkT28jang70,4011839,4019039,because of god well god didn't say act  of fooling the marriage at the same time  like what's the point exactly how are
NkT28jang70,4019039,4025760,you glorifying  god or your spiritual beliefs by staying  in a negative  marriage for the sake of staying you're
NkT28jang70,4025760,4033280,defeating the purpose the purpose is to  have a healthy happy union  to raise healthy happy children if we
NkT28jang70,4033280,4039359,can't achieve that together  it's time to go i mean i wish it could  be different but that's just the reality
NkT28jang70,4039359,4045119,of the world we live in  because too many of us have made the  wrong decision in who we married
NkT28jang70,4045119,4050640,and we have to accept that i'd rather  you accept that now  go through your healing process and both
NkT28jang70,4050640,4056240,of you can find your happiness and learn  how to coexist as co-parents and again
NkT28jang70,4056240,4062079,creating a positive environment in that  co-parenting relationship because i  don't want you to be co-parents and  still be dysfunctional
NkT28jang70,4062079,4068480,exactly again defeating the purpose all  right i  i want you to get away from each other  so you can find happiness not be more
NkT28jang70,4068480,4074640,negative yeah heal  move forward yeah exactly be happy be  happy for them if they found someone
NkT28jang70,4074640,4080880,else i know that's tough for a lot of  people  but be happy if they're at peace you  find your peace let the children see
NkT28jang70,4080880,4087920,happy healthy relationships not just  with other people within yourself  stop showing them a miserable father or
NkT28jang70,4087920,4093520,mother they see it  and they hold on to resentment i can't  tell you how many
NkT28jang70,4093520,4100080,i won't say every but i want to say 90  of clients that i've seen and i would  argue that if you spoke to any therapist
NkT28jang70,4100080,4105679,or coach out there  the majority of people have issues  stemming from their parents
NkT28jang70,4105679,4112000,growing up in that household yeah or  their environment  exactly their parents or their  environments yeah exactly and it's just
NkT28jang70,4112000,4117920,always a dysfunctional relationship  relationships is the backbone of society  when we allow that to be as
NkT28jang70,4117920,4123758,dysfunctional as it is right now that's  the reason why we have all these  problems  yeah we fix that man this world becomes
NkT28jang70,4123758,4130838,a hundred times better place to live  yeah  [Music]
NkT28jang70,4130838,4136318,easily  why are we lying to ourselves so much  because it is shameful
NkT28jang70,4136318,4142480,and a lot of times we hate that we got  there  we got ourselves we hate ourselves that
NkT28jang70,4142480,4149040,we got there how in the world did i get  to this place  how do i need these pills to go to sleep  or to wake up how in the world do i have
NkT28jang70,4149040,4155440,to  keep kissing their butt to steal work at  this job like  this is not me this is not who i want
NkT28jang70,4155440,4160960,and so because we have disdain for who  we have become  it's like if we acknowledge it that
NkT28jang70,4160960,4166719,reinforces that we're actually there  and maybe we can't live with that and so
NkT28jang70,4166719,4172880,it's  this vicious cycle of  faking to make it and that's why a lot
NkT28jang70,4172880,4178159,of people say you gotta fake it till you  make it i'm like no  no no no no face it so you can make it
NkT28jang70,4178159,4185040,be real  so that you can actually move on to  there and a lot of people  are delaying the inevitable you can't
NkT28jang70,4185040,4190318,hold up a facade forever  no it's gonna come at some point it's  gonna crumble the sad thing is
NkT28jang70,4190318,4195679,a lot of time it crumbles when it has  more people to damage  oh a lot of times almost always right
NkT28jang70,4195679,4201600,yeah a lot of time it crumbles  now i have three children and they're in  relationships and
NkT28jang70,4201600,4208719,now everything's dependent on me and  i've built this empire  um um of podcasting or business or
NkT28jang70,4208719,4214159,um fitness and now i'm in this space and  place that if i'm honest it'll cost too
NkT28jang70,4214159,4219360,much  may i submit to you if you're not honest  it's going to cost you too much
NkT28jang70,4219360,4225920,yeah i'm i'm already online let me stop  so how to uh have you have you had to
NkT28jang70,4225920,4233760,heal  in the last 10 years your relationship  from stuff that happens  every year or is it only stuff from 10
NkT28jang70,4233760,4240640,years ago  that you guys have to work on bro you  know the answer to this question man  i'm a flawed man yeah my wife is a
NkT28jang70,4240640,4246400,flawed woman  um we serve uh an amazing god we we're  people of faith
NkT28jang70,4246400,4252480,um but he knew we were gonna mess up and  there was  there was there was uh room in the plan
NkT28jang70,4252480,4257600,for imperfection  like that's what i always tell people  because i'm a pastor and people know i'm
NkT28jang70,4257600,4263040,a person  of faith and they think i'm just going  to throw the bible at them all the time  and what i tell them i was like no no
NkT28jang70,4263040,4268159,just first look at my life  like i've experienced amazing grace
NkT28jang70,4268159,4273920,and now i have to extend amazing grace  and i have to receive  amazing grace because i'm still gonna
NkT28jang70,4273920,4281040,mess up my wife had to forgive me for  something but before i came up here you  don't understand like  this is a daily walk but that's why i
NkT28jang70,4281040,4287360,tell everybody the beautiful thing about  journey if you can get this stuck  in your brain and in your heart really
NkT28jang70,4287360,4292960,is that this life is about progression  not perfection  i know culture sells as perfection i
NkT28jang70,4292960,4298480,know your parents may have wanted  perfection from you  i know you've probably required  perfection of yourself but that is the
NkT28jang70,4298480,4306080,wrong metric  this is about progression how much did  you move forward  from yesterday to today or how much did
NkT28jang70,4306080,4312320,you move past  i know you wanted to cuss them out last  week but you only said one cuss word  this week you know what i'm saying or
NkT28jang70,4312320,4317920,last year it was about  um being successful you didn't take any  breaks but this year you actually
NkT28jang70,4317920,4324880,took a few days and and had soul care  and self-care and spiritual  enlightenment  and getting back in your place of faith
NkT28jang70,4324880,4330400,like how did you progress  and i think for me in all of my  relationships especially
NkT28jang70,4330400,4337520,the one with my wife the one that i'm in  covenant with um  i have to know that i'm gonna need grace
NkT28jang70,4337520,4343199,because i'm still figuring it out right  like there's nobody anybody on earth  that says they're a relationship expert
NkT28jang70,4343199,4349520,are liars nobody knows everything about  all relationships we're just trying to  share  from our journey and truth that we've
NkT28jang70,4349520,4356800,experienced and um  i know for me that in the journey that  i'm  in right now i make a lot less mistakes
NkT28jang70,4356800,4362880,than i made 10 years ago  right because i've progressed but am i  going to make more mistakes the next 10
NkT28jang70,4362880,4368000,minutes probably  you know what i'm saying and so it is  daily and yeah there's tons of healing
NkT28jang70,4368000,4373040,that has to happen  from every lie from every deception
NkT28jang70,4373040,4379840,from every um wrong word that was spoken  i tell people this because a  relationship is all about trust
NkT28jang70,4379840,4386640,and this is the thing that people don't  really factor in you can spend  decades years months building trusts but
NkT28jang70,4386640,4391679,this is the truth  trust is lost in buckets but gain back  in drops
NkT28jang70,4391679,4397120,yeah so you could have an entire  five gallon bucket of trust built up
NkT28jang70,4397120,4403920,yeah but one thing  that you never said you would do you do  and the whole bucket goes out gone and
NkT28jang70,4403920,4409600,now you have to come back in  every day drop by drop drop by drop you  don't get a
NkT28jang70,4409600,4414880,uh of trust built back up and that's  where most relationships fail
NkT28jang70,4414880,4420320,is because they lost the trust and they  were not diligent enough to build it  back up
NkT28jang70,4420320,4425600,because it takes a lot of time but the  problem is you have history with that  person and a lot of times they would
NkT28jang70,4425600,4432480,rather start over with somebody else  to do the same exact thing instead of  going back and yeah it sucks
NkT28jang70,4432480,4439920,yeah no didn't we talk about this you  know i don't you know oh come on  but no this is valuable and i'm the one
NkT28jang70,4439920,4445840,who  tipped this thing over and so i'm gonna  be the one to be consistent enough or  disciplined enough
NkT28jang70,4445840,4451360,to put those drops back in what's been  the biggest lesson for you  in the last 10 years of putting drops
NkT28jang70,4451360,4456480,back in  over a decade plus with your wife
NkT28jang70,4456480,4462320,what's the lesson you've learned as a  human being through that discipline  through that daily drop yeah after
NkT28jang70,4462320,4468560,breaking trust  yeah back in the past yeah yeah um trust  is way more valuable than money
NkT28jang70,4468560,4474320,trust is way more valuable than  connection  trust is way more valuable um there's a
NkT28jang70,4474320,4481199,book that i  encourage everybody to read it's called  the speed of trust  and um it basically the premise is
NkT28jang70,4481199,4488400,that where there's trust everything um  takes less energy  yeah it takes less money and it has
NkT28jang70,4488400,4495199,better results  but where there is no trust it takes  more energy  it takes more money and there are
NkT28jang70,4495199,4500320,minimal results  yeah and you can apply this to business  relationships you can provide to your
NkT28jang70,4500320,4508320,family  and i think our culture is one that  doesn't trust we  you prove to me and and and at the
NkT28jang70,4508320,4513920,moment  that we don't um go into situations with  trust  there's this disconnection that doesn't
NkT28jang70,4513920,4520480,allow people like the vibes not right  or all these different sayings i think  for me i've learned that trust is
NkT28jang70,4520480,4526640,probably a higher commodity than  anything else  my greatest relationship me and my wife  natalie don't have to be doing anything
NkT28jang70,4526640,4532000,but when i'm in  a bed in a hotel with a woman that i  fully trust
NkT28jang70,4532000,4539120,it's more satisfying than any platform  i've ever been on wow  it's more euphoric it's more when i can
NkT28jang70,4539120,4544719,say something and somebody believes me  and i don't have to prove it to them  but they know what i'm saying is real
NkT28jang70,4544719,4550000,that's amazing feeling oh  what are you talking about name the  places you get that
NkT28jang70,4550000,4555440,name the places you to make  presentations to make people you pay  believe you come on let's let's be
NkT28jang70,4555440,4561280,honest like  because they're still not full of trust  there but when you put in
NkT28jang70,4561280,4566719,so much trust that that person your yes  is a yes and your no is a no and then
NkT28jang70,4566719,4572080,people  trust what you say yeah when i told my
NkT28jang70,4572080,4579600,wife  that i was going to take care of her and  i would never hurt her again  and to be able to now 10 years removed
NkT28jang70,4579600,4585920,we just did a 10-year val renewal and we  went out to the sand desert and now it  was me and our three kids
NkT28jang70,4585920,4592000,and we're sitting there and glass runway  it's on youtube and we just like it was  just the most beautiful thing to look
NkT28jang70,4592000,4599520,into our eyes  and say the words unscripted  that came from my heart and to look at
NkT28jang70,4599520,4606000,her and knew they were hitting her heart  and she fully trusted what i said  you can't tell me nothing like nobody
NkT28jang70,4606000,4611600,like there's no feeling like that and  the sad truth louis is most people will  never feel that
NkT28jang70,4611600,4618239,they will never know what it is to have  another human being  with your flaws with knowing the worst
NkT28jang70,4618239,4624400,about you i can't hide from my wife she  knows everything that i do  she knows when i do take showers when i  don't take showers she knows when i
NkT28jang70,4624400,4629679,leave the toilet seat up or when i put  it down  so you know like so in the most  vulnerable place
NkT28jang70,4629679,4636320,she knows when i do my workout and when  i don't like  i can't hide from her i can hide from  people on social media i can hide from
NkT28jang70,4636320,4643920,people  that are that i work with but from her  i'm vulnerable  and to know when i speak she trusted
NkT28jang70,4643920,4650400,it was well worth everything that i had  to do  and what happens if you are a hundred
NkT28jang70,4650400,4655840,percent in integrity with your word  you're following through you're being  honest you're
NkT28jang70,4655840,4662320,showing up you're delivering in a  relationship but the person doesn't  trust you  yeah after years yeah and you're like
NkT28jang70,4662320,4668960,you have access to my phone yeah these  right passwords  you you know where i'm at 24 7. yeah and  you still don't trust me is that still
NkT28jang70,4668960,4674239,my responsibility or is that the other  partner's work they get to do so the  beautiful thing about the story that i'm
NkT28jang70,4674239,4681280,telling you i'm telling you from my side  yeah but if you were to talk to my wife  right now there were things she had to  do  on her own during this whole process or
NkT28jang70,4681280,4687440,she wouldn't have made it she wasn't  sitting there like  prove to me that you were no there was  self-discovery she was going on do i
NkT28jang70,4687440,4694159,want to stay in this relationship  is this worth it what do i bring what do  i have  what am i worth and that's why i tell
NkT28jang70,4694159,4700640,people all the time no matter if you're  a couple you're still single  like even though you're in a  relationship you still
NkT28jang70,4700640,4707280,have to be single enough to continue to  improve  a lot of people stop improving once they  get in a relationship like i got it
NkT28jang70,4707280,4713199,what else do i need to do i made it and  all that other stuff but when you are  in a relationship there are still two
NkT28jang70,4713199,4720159,very single people  that need to work on their communication  work on their insecurities  work on their ability to communicate
NkT28jang70,4720159,4727199,work like  and if you stop developing your  singleness  in marriage or in relationship that
NkT28jang70,4727199,4733199,relationship  is headed for at one po one point for  somebody to be on another level and be
NkT28jang70,4733199,4738640,like this is not what we signed up for  hey i thought we were partners i thought  we were we were doing this
NkT28jang70,4738640,4744000,together i thought we were growing and  going towards this together  and that's why i encourage people all
NkT28jang70,4744000,4750400,the time like what have you brought to  the relationship lately  like what skills have you improved in
NkT28jang70,4750400,4756480,what  has your emotional intelligence gone to  another level has your spiritual  awareness gone to another level has your
NkT28jang70,4756480,4761840,faith going to another level  has your have you learned a new language  so when we go on our
NkT28jang70,4761840,4766880,vacation two years from now we don't get  swindled at the  you know like what are you bringing to
NkT28jang70,4766880,4772800,the relationship and i just would  encourage  every couple not to focus on because  when i say this a lot of times they'll
NkT28jang70,4772800,4778400,be like see you ain't brought none to  the relationship  in three years kathy like hold on hold  on a second
NkT28jang70,4778400,4784800,like no ask yourself what have you  brought to the relationships  and if you both are asking yourself
NkT28jang70,4784800,4790239,that's part of the reason we wrote that  um this book taking your relationship  from good to great because it allows  people
NkT28jang70,4790239,4796719,to evaluate where they're at spiritually  emotionally  and then be able to say what do i need
NkT28jang70,4796719,4803440,to change how do i need to do this  and that's the only way that you can go  from good to great in any relationship
NkT28jang70,4803440,4809040,my friend matthew hussey talks about  this he talks about relationships from  women  on how to really attract the right man
NkT28jang70,4809040,4814400,in their life the right partner  and he said to me one time you know if  you want to
NkT28jang70,4814400,4819440,find a great partner make a list of all  the things you want from them and then  become that list
NkT28jang70,4819440,4825360,yourself whatever you want someone else  you need to become that first  and really add that value to them as
NkT28jang70,4825360,4830880,well yeah it's kind of like what i'm  hearing you say is okay after a year  two five ten years you have to keep
NkT28jang70,4830880,4836480,becoming that list  yourself to to keep that partner excited
NkT28jang70,4836480,4843040,or engaged and trustworthy and connected  and  both parties have to be working on that  list exactly now i i have a little
NkT28jang70,4843040,4849120,different  perspective on the list because  sometimes  the list limits you who tell me more
NkT28jang70,4849120,4856000,like so  i tell people a lot of time because  specifically a lot of my sisters  a lot of uh they make this now they got
NkT28jang70,4856000,4863199,this he got to be 6'5  he's got to have this amount of money  because they becoming the things that  they  want from the qualities not the the
NkT28jang70,4863199,4869040,things the qualities yeah and that's the  thing  sometimes i do believe that there are  certain things that you need to be able
NkT28jang70,4869040,4876880,to  um lay out and really ask yourself am i  becoming those things  i don't think though the package always
NkT28jang70,4876880,4883520,comes the way you think it's going to  work true and so  a lot of times like six five sheets
NkT28jang70,4883520,4888880,and and and all kinds of things even  some of the qualities because the thing  is i tell people this
NkT28jang70,4888880,4896400,you write down what you want i believe  god factors in  with your mate what you need to do see
NkT28jang70,4896400,4902719,the problem is like if you ask natalie  i'm not what she wanted  what does she want she wanted uh some
NkT28jang70,4902719,4909199,big uh  hispanic uh uh model  for the lotion like she wanted somebody
NkT28jang70,4909199,4914880,you know what i'm saying  the typical yeah beautiful but what she  needed was me
NkT28jang70,4914880,4920080,and and when you look a lot of people  make these  lists at the beginning of their list but
NkT28jang70,4920080,4925760,somebody needs to start a podcast  interviewing couples who actually made  it  right so somebody you maybe need to do a
NkT28jang70,4925760,4930800,series of relationships who  lasted for 40 plus years that thrived  that's
NkT28jang70,4930800,4937679,why not that stayed together they're not  resenting each other and not that were  business partners  right that thrived because if you ask a
NkT28jang70,4937679,4943360,lot of them which i did a lot of  research  writing relationship goals the book when  you ask them
NkT28jang70,4943360,4950159,most of them did not get what they  wanted on their list  they got what they found out they needed
NkT28jang70,4950159,4956400,and the honestly the things that i need  i don't ever write down on the list  because  i need somebody to help encourage me
NkT28jang70,4956400,4962560,when i want to go have ice cream  instead of stick to my diet i don't  write that down on the list
NkT28jang70,4962560,4968560,i just write down i want somebody  supportive well in my mind when i'm  writing that down on the list i'm  thinking support me on whatever i'm
NkT28jang70,4968560,4975760,feeling at that moment  maybe not support me and what i've  decided in a different moment  and i need that but it's not necessarily
NkT28jang70,4975760,4982719,that i want it  and i found out that a lot of times when  you rip  up the list and start becoming the best
NkT28jang70,4982719,4990800,version of you that you can be  you will then begin to see that i  am now worthy and worth being with
NkT28jang70,4990800,4998320,somebody  who's worthy and worth being with right  and you don't  settle for a lot less and that's why i
NkT28jang70,4998320,5006000,called it a relationship goal i know  it's a proper a popular um  term um in in culture but i said
NkT28jang70,5006000,5012719,people aren't doing good at relationship  is because they don't have  aim like they're they're not aiming at a
NkT28jang70,5012719,5019600,goal  that actually is going to produce the  the greatest  end for them and so that's my whole
NkT28jang70,5019600,5025120,thought about it i do believe  you got to become your best version your  best self but then
NkT28jang70,5025120,5031679,when you do that a lot of times it  creates an entitlement in people  that they will they will dismiss the
NkT28jang70,5031679,5037280,right thing  because of the wrong package and what  happens if  you continue to be your best version
NkT28jang70,5037280,5042800,year after year and the other person's  not willing to go on that journey  is it is it until death do we part even
NkT28jang70,5042800,5049679,if they're  constantly pulling you down and saying  i'm not going to work on myself  yeah you do all the work i don't trust
NkT28jang70,5049679,5057120,you even if you're 100 honest  yeah is it you know is that there's  all there's always provision um in a
NkT28jang70,5057120,5063280,relationship especially when there's  infidelity and there's different things  that have happened  that there may be this may be an
NkT28jang70,5063280,5069360,unhealthy situation  that we that we can't um progress in i  honestly feel though a lot of people
NkT28jang70,5069360,5075440,give up too soon on that yeah  nothing good um ever comes out of
NkT28jang70,5075440,5081679,the easy way there is nothing great  i'll say great that comes out of easy if
NkT28jang70,5081679,5087040,it's gonna be great  there's gotta be some work that goes  into it some pain so there's gotta be
NkT28jang70,5087040,5094239,some pain there's gotta  be discomfort there's gotta be do i  gotta do this again  are we still talking about this and i
NkT28jang70,5094239,5099280,really do believe in  our um society today that we rush into  things
NkT28jang70,5099280,5105040,because we know how easy we can get out  of them instead of taking the time  that's honestly why our
NkT28jang70,5105040,5110080,written books and done series and  millions of people have watched it  because i'm trying to convince people
NkT28jang70,5110080,5117199,like hey  like take this seriously it's not just  like uh  oh we met at the bar we hooked up uh we
NkT28jang70,5117199,5122239,lived together  now we should uh um make a life together  and i'm not saying that
NkT28jang70,5122239,5127840,um people haven't been in relationships  that have worked like that  i'm just saying that if you had to take
NkT28jang70,5127840,5134800,a test  to get a driver's license  and and and be able to drive legally
NkT28jang70,5134800,5141040,in your state it's easier  to get in a relationship with somebody
NkT28jang70,5141040,5148400,build a marriage have kids that are  going to affect the rest of  us with no actual preparation no
NkT28jang70,5148400,5155440,training  no training no required reading  no counseling no honesty like no like
NkT28jang70,5155440,5161760,hey  just before we get married let me tell  you how much debt i'm in hey  just before we get married let me tell
NkT28jang70,5161760,5168239,you that your friend  and that friend and i slept with all of  them just before  there's no requirements and that's why
NkT28jang70,5168239,5174639,i'm saying if  if we don't put that in  and build that into the relationships we
NkT28jang70,5174639,5182000,want how can we expect it's gambling  it's like maybe this will work or maybe  it won't  i think we can be more intentional on
NkT28jang70,5182000,5187600,setting a real goal  and i believe those goals need to be um  put on principles
NkT28jang70,5187600,5192639,that have lasted in faith that can  last for a long time man what are the
NkT28jang70,5192639,5198560,main principles that every relationship  should be founded  upon bro i wrote a whole book about it  i'm gonna give you three
NkT28jang70,5198560,5204320,three let me give you three of them the  first thing has to be transparency yeah  about everything everything like i had
NkT28jang70,5204320,5211280,this thought yeah  i looked at this i did any idea so so i  don't  i'll say this you have to be wise
NkT28jang70,5211280,5216320,because you you have to depending on the  layer of relationship you're in right  now if you just meet somebody today
NkT28jang70,5216320,5221679,and you don't even know if you want to  be with them i don't think it's wise  that you  you you tell them everything but i do
NkT28jang70,5221679,5229040,believe that there's a difference  between transparency and honesty  and many people have um adopted the
NkT28jang70,5229040,5236159,um thought process and the philosophy of  being honest but not transparent  honesty is is when you ask me i'll tell
NkT28jang70,5236159,5242560,you the truth  but until then but until then i'm i'm  hiding something yes  and a lot of times most of us don't get
NkT28jang70,5242560,5248480,asked the questions that we need to  answer  because those questions are scary oh my  gosh they're scary to ask and you don't
NkT28jang70,5248480,5255199,want to know the answers and you don't  want to know a lot of times and and then  it automatically  if the person is not emotionally um um
NkT28jang70,5255199,5260239,secure enough  then they're like what you don't trust  me like there's so many different things  that are there
NkT28jang70,5260239,5265440,and that's why i always ascribe to the  philosophy of being transparent  you don't have to ask me i'm going to
NkT28jang70,5265440,5270560,offer it up i'm going to tell you  hey this when you when you talk to that  guy
NkT28jang70,5270560,5275840,at the restaurant that made me feel some  type of way  and it made me really start thinking
NkT28jang70,5275840,5282000,about the insecurities of my last  relationship  and why we broke up and i'm not asking  you to solve it at this moment
NkT28jang70,5282000,5288159,but i'm letting you know how that made  me feel  and um i'm just gonna process with that
NkT28jang70,5288159,5293199,there's no question  that your mate could have asked to get  that
NkT28jang70,5293199,5300639,um um response that genuinely  because then they'll say something like  this are you okay yeah i'm fine
NkT28jang70,5300639,5307360,and the truth is no you're not but i  don't emotionally know how to let you  know  that that honestly it wasn't really what
NkT28jang70,5307360,5312800,you did it's what i've been through  yeah that triggered something in me and  now
NkT28jang70,5312800,5318080,i'm insecure about what i know i have  but  it's because of what happened to me like
NkT28jang70,5318080,5323840,sure but that takes being transparent  and what i've found is when i'm  transparent it honestly provides more
NkT28jang70,5323840,5329199,empathy from the other person  to be able to man i'm sorry you felt  that way
NkT28jang70,5329199,5335520,what can i do and like that then  is deepening that relationship more than
NkT28jang70,5335520,5341199,it is creating a wedge between it so  i would say number one transparency
NkT28jang70,5341199,5347360,has to be the top thing that you have  in a relationship i think that you need
NkT28jang70,5347360,5353679,to have  um common faith goals i think for me  um a lot of things that i found in
NkT28jang70,5353679,5359440,relationship is a lot of people  like each other but what their their  faith is founded on
NkT28jang70,5359440,5366080,are two totally different things and i  think you should be equally yoked in the  are equally compatible in the things
NkT28jang70,5366080,5372480,that you believe  and and when you do that it's more easy  it's easier to have conversations about
NkT28jang70,5372480,5378960,how to raise children  finances it's easier to be able to go  to for me and my wife um we're
NkT28jang70,5378960,5384880,christians that believe in the bible and  so there are certain things that we  disagree on and then we can go to the  bible and we're like okay
NkT28jang70,5384880,5391040,but this is something that we believe  together  let's wrestle through this let's work  through this let's how does that make
NkT28jang70,5391040,5396400,you feel let's ask somebody  there are so many problems that have  been solved because we
NkT28jang70,5396400,5402480,believe the same things um  foundationally in our faith  and i'm encouraging people a lot of
NkT28jang70,5402480,5409040,times that when you do that  it creates a foundation that moves past  emotions a lot of times
NkT28jang70,5409040,5416480,that triggers yeah it's just like well i  can't get it and i can't get it  but then when you go to certain thing  love is patient love is kind
NkT28jang70,5416480,5422800,love keeps no record of wrong damn first  corinthians 13  is jacking me up right now love love
NkT28jang70,5422800,5427840,offers forgiveness  love oh love is long suffering like
NkT28jang70,5427840,5433280,these are words  that we have adopted from a book that we  believe has
NkT28jang70,5433280,5439360,truth in it and principles to live by  and because  we're on the same level in that faith it
NkT28jang70,5439360,5444719,corrects us sometimes when we don't want  to be corrected  and that's where um i tell people the
NkT28jang70,5444719,5451440,bible is one of the only books you can  read that when you read it it reads you  like and and for us that has helped us
NkT28jang70,5451440,5456719,and so  transparency having strong faith  foundations and then the third thing  that i would say
NkT28jang70,5456719,5462000,is fun yeah if you cannot have fun with  the person that you're in relationship
NkT28jang70,5462000,5469040,with good luck like because there's  certain things life is hard  it is hard there will be trouble it's
NkT28jang70,5469040,5476400,promised  but but if you can find somebody to look  at in the in the darkest part of the
NkT28jang70,5476400,5482000,valley  and life and laugh with them it happened  to me and natalie on the plane yesterday  i told you before
NkT28jang70,5482000,5488159,um we brought two of our daughters with  us and they're seven  and three years old and we're on a plane
NkT28jang70,5488159,5495040,from tulsa to la three and a half hours  you can imagine all the fruit snacks and  the ipads and all of the different
NkT28jang70,5495040,5501760,things  crying just the whole nine and my wife  is pregnant right now  so put that on top of it so and she's
NkT28jang70,5501760,5507360,trying to eat  and i'm sitting in the chair next to her  and something drops off of her plate and  i can just
NkT28jang70,5507360,5512880,i can see the break down right down  up just right up ahead like a movie and
NkT28jang70,5512880,5518000,i just look at her  and just start laughing and she sees me  and she
NkT28jang70,5518000,5524880,breaks out and for 20 minutes laughing  we  are dying on the plane not because
NkT28jang70,5524880,5530000,everything's good  because we have somebody to be through
NkT28jang70,5530000,5535040,and go through everything with us and  that  joy i mean literally we got off the
NkT28jang70,5535040,5540400,plane and all the other stuff she said i  haven't laughed like that  in so long and she was just kept
NkT28jang70,5540400,5546239,laughing about it and those are the  moments that i found  like i told you a little bit before but
NkT28jang70,5546239,5551360,our son um mj he's five  um he was diagnosed with autism
NkT28jang70,5551360,5558239,and um this has been the greatest  emotional faith journey that we've been
NkT28jang70,5558239,5565679,on he's five years old still nonverbal  i'm the guy of faith i lead a church i  i'm a pastor i believe and in my home
NkT28jang70,5565679,5571120,there's a situation  that has not changed yet and it's  challenged everything
NkT28jang70,5571120,5577120,the one thing that has gotten us through  or excuse me the three things that have  gotten us through the three things i
NkT28jang70,5577120,5583520,just gave you  transparency our faith foundation being  the same  and being fun i wouldn't be sitting here
NkT28jang70,5583520,5589679,today talking to you  on my way to a fourth child after my  wife battling depression
NkT28jang70,5589679,5596400,me challenging my calling trying to  figure out why is this happening  at the moment where everything great in
NkT28jang70,5596400,5602480,my life is happening  and it's those three things being  transparent about how i felt
NkT28jang70,5602480,5608159,and my emotions and her being  transparent about how she felt and her  emotions  and having our faith anchored to
NkT28jang70,5608159,5613600,something that was stronger than us  and us having fun that i told you before  we came in here
NkT28jang70,5613600,5621040,i am having the most fun in relationship  i'm not faking this is authentic  this is the joy that i have to be
NkT28jang70,5621040,5627120,because  we have decided that there are some  principles we have to live by  that that most people are going to show
NkT28jang70,5627120,5632560,you in reality television  most people aren't going to give you in  a blog or a tabloid
NkT28jang70,5632560,5637600,and it has to be lived out and that's  what we're trying to do before we  continue this video make sure to

NkT28jang70,5650719,5655760,what's your definition of chemistry  connection and compatibility
NkT28jang70,5655760,5662480,all right so chemistry  to me is is the art of getting along
NkT28jang70,5662480,5667520,flowing with each other all right  chemistry can be created it can be  destroyed
NkT28jang70,5667520,5674239,think about it from a team sports  perspective you can put players together  and they have to build team chemistry so
NkT28jang70,5674239,5679520,through repetition through practice they  can get to a point of having chemistry
NkT28jang70,5679520,5685440,yes some people have instant chemistry  all right  but just as it was instant it can also
NkT28jang70,5685440,5691199,be broken  instantly exactly you know we can start  to not get along and not flow with each
NkT28jang70,5691199,5696239,other very easily  things can get in the way and again this  happens even in team sports or
NkT28jang70,5696239,5702000,even in the corporate arena where you  have team building exercises but then  things happen that destroy the structure
NkT28jang70,5702000,5708560,of the business  so that's chemistry that's chemistry how  important is chemistry  it is still very important it is not the
NkT28jang70,5708560,5714480,most important  and i say that to mean chemistry has to  be in every relationship for it to work
NkT28jang70,5714480,5721280,and flourish  but it does not set the stage for  everything else  all right connection sets the stage for
NkT28jang70,5721280,5728400,everything else  so basically if you have connection you  will be able to have  chemistry and compatibility but now
NkT28jang70,5728400,5733679,let's talk about compatibility  i believe compatibility is a very logic
NkT28jang70,5733679,5739520,based  structure of putting two people together  it's also about we're compatible in the
NkT28jang70,5739520,5744639,sense that we share  values all right so again you can meet  someone
NkT28jang70,5744639,5750480,that you are quote-unquote compatible  with you guys share  similar values you guys come from even
NkT28jang70,5750480,5757280,maybe the same kind of cultures  there could be a lot of things that make  you guys compatible on paper
NkT28jang70,5757280,5762560,what is real compatibility well to me  that is real compatibility so to speak
NkT28jang70,5762560,5770159,is that yes you guys on paper are a good  fit all right and you guys  should work but again without connection
NkT28jang70,5770159,5776000,it won't matter so i would argue that a  lot of marriages  let's even talk about arranged marriages
NkT28jang70,5776000,5781119,some of them were built on  compatibility well this person came from  the right family
NkT28jang70,5781119,5787280,so we we like this they have a good job  they have a good education  they would be a good fit here they share
NkT28jang70,5787280,5792480,the same values  but when those two people are really  alone with each other
NkT28jang70,5792480,5798320,it doesn't always hit which is why if  you go on an online dating site  it can match two people together that
NkT28jang70,5798320,5804000,are compatible on paper  interesting but in person it doesn't  always play out the same
NkT28jang70,5804000,5811119,because what is missing the chemistry or  more importantly the connection  and sometimes we might be tricked oh we
NkT28jang70,5811119,5817440,feel the spark of  chemistry but you may not have  connection is that true  absolutely absolutely so you might say
NkT28jang70,5817440,5824800,oh we're compatible  on paper everything we have the same  values we want the same things for our  life  and marriage and kids and where families
NkT28jang70,5824800,5831600,going to be  we have compatibility we have chemistry  there's some type of spark here mm-hmm  i feel like there's a little something
NkT28jang70,5831600,5839199,down here yeah  we get along and we know how to flow of  each other that's amazing  but you're saying if we can't find true
NkT28jang70,5839199,5845840,connection or if there isn't connection  can connection be created  no and so that's the that's the huge  distinction to me with connection
NkT28jang70,5845840,5852560,connection cannot be created nor can it  be destroyed it's either there or it's  not  wow there's nothing you can do to build
NkT28jang70,5852560,5858320,connection you can build a stronger bond  you can uh create a stronger attachment  to each other
NkT28jang70,5858320,5865119,but that still doesn't mean connection  is there and and  you see this play out in situations  where you have people who could
NkT28jang70,5865119,5870639,have meet each other right now have this  amazing connection  something happens where they fall apart
NkT28jang70,5870639,5876320,they come back together years later 10  20 years later and it's like they never  stop talking it just falls right back
NkT28jang70,5876320,5882080,into place it's connection  it's a deeper thing that's occurring  there to me connection is your spirit
NkT28jang70,5882080,5888880,recognizing its match it is something  that is happening beneath the surface  all right  which is why many people who have felt
NkT28jang70,5888880,5896080,connection  you can't always explain it connection  does not always line up with the  logic of compatibility it's not always
NkT28jang70,5896080,5901840,oh well  it makes sense because of this no no  it's just there  you just feel something with this person
NkT28jang70,5901840,5907360,you feel drawn to them it's so much  deeper than anything you've ever felt  and and consider this
NkT28jang70,5907360,5912560,you can be compatible with tons of  people  you can have chemistry with tons of
NkT28jang70,5912560,5918480,people you do not feel connection with a  bunch of people  period if we were to survey people who
NkT28jang70,5918480,5925440,have felt a connection in their life  you'd be lucky to find many who can say  two times wow the majority will say it's
NkT28jang70,5925440,5932080,a one-time occurrence that has happened  to them  all right and and being able to have  that again it's very difficult now i
NkT28jang70,5932080,5937840,don't want anyone listening to be  discouraged if  they did not end up with the person they  had a connection with i'm not saying
NkT28jang70,5937840,5944000,it's impossible for it to happen a  second time  but i will say that if you surveyed  people you would have a hard time
NkT28jang70,5944000,5949280,finding that many people that say it  said it happened twice when does someone
NkT28jang70,5949280,5955520,know  it's connection and not chemistry  because i feel like  you might be tricked we have this
NkT28jang70,5955520,5962080,incredible connection we understand each  other we get each other  i can't explain it but i feel something
NkT28jang70,5962080,5967440,that feeling might be also chemistry at  the same time  right it might be masking yes if it's
NkT28jang70,5967440,5972560,really connection or chemistry how do  you know if it's true connection  over man this is desire connection
NkT28jang70,5972560,5979920,attraction  all these things happening at once one  can you  truly be yourself with that's big all
NkT28jang70,5979920,5985440,right  because again a lot of people they go on  these dates they're bringing their  representative
NkT28jang70,5985440,5991840,and the chemistry happens on a surface  level  with the representatives that both sides  are bringing but when you
NkT28jang70,5991840,5998159,actually show your true self now what  happens  and a lot of people have not done that
NkT28jang70,5998159,6004800,with their partner the person that  they're getting to know  so again you're falling into the hype of  the chemistry or the compatibility but
NkT28jang70,6004800,6010719,you're not discovering true connection  being there so you've got to be able to  be yourself because real connection
NkT28jang70,6010719,6016400,loves you at the core  all right you can show me all the parts  of you i still want you
NkT28jang70,6016400,6021600,all right number two is can we enjoy  each other with no
NkT28jang70,6021600,6026880,distractions all right again  what people fail to understand and this
NkT28jang70,6026880,6033280,can happen with chemistry is that  we're we're bonding based off of
NkT28jang70,6033280,6039119,the activity or the the things in our  environment meaning  all right we we love going out together
NkT28jang70,6039119,6044960,and we do all these fun  stuff and we're doing all these things  and that's great all right we know how  to have fun together
NkT28jang70,6044960,6051199,but can we be alone in the room no tv  no distraction no phone just us and
NkT28jang70,6051199,6058239,still  love being with each other a lot of  people can't say that  a lot of people are only able to be in
NkT28jang70,6058239,6064639,their relationship  and tolerate their partner and i use  that word strongly  tolerate their partner because they have
NkT28jang70,6064639,6070800,enough distractions in life  they have kids they have work they have  all these other things tv video games
NkT28jang70,6070800,6077520,man caves whatever exactly all these  things that pull them away from their  partner  that doesn't allow them to face the fact
NkT28jang70,6077520,6083119,that no you really don't like each other  at the court  man and and so that is a huge sign of
NkT28jang70,6083119,6089920,connection that's why like  one thing i suggested in one of my books  was go on a road trip and  it's just a random suggestion but go on
NkT28jang70,6089920,6095920,a road trip for at least six hours no  phone  no distraction just you and them talking
NkT28jang70,6095920,6101920,will you still be happy after those six  hours a lot of people can't make it that  far in a car ride with their partner
NkT28jang70,6101920,6108719,all right a lot of people cannot be in a  room alone with their partner and  nothing else  to take their attention so you've gotta
NkT28jang70,6108719,6115040,you gotta really push those boundaries  to see  what do we really have here if this is  really gonna be called a connection
NkT28jang70,6115040,6121679,right and your fear is  are you able to grow together after 10
NkT28jang70,6121679,6126719,15 years is that one of the main things  is  so it's it's you know it's hard to you
NkT28jang70,6126719,6132719,know you never you never can look that  far ahead  you know and we don't know what's in  store i may not be here tomorrow exactly
NkT28jang70,6132719,6139199,it's it's a concern of can we  still give that same energy and it's
NkT28jang70,6139199,6146800,both sides because again  i'm not saying i'm not perfect so even  though i'm confident  that i could do it what if there's
NkT28jang70,6146800,6154400,something that throws me off you know  it's just that yes it as time goes on  there's that test of really putting your
NkT28jang70,6154400,6159679,best foot  and bringing that that same energy that  you brought in the beginning now again i  think
NkT28jang70,6159679,6165199,i'm holding myself to a higher standard  that i think most people do because i  think that a lot of people's mentality
NkT28jang70,6165199,6171440,is  well things change things are going to  be different it's okay  so what you don't go out as much anymore
NkT28jang70,6171440,6177760,people think like this but they don't  realize that's why your relationship is  deteriorating right  i don't want a deteriorated relationship
NkT28jang70,6177760,6185199,so when i think about yes can i  be with someone past 10 15 years if i  accept a level of mediocrity of course
NkT28jang70,6185199,6192000,but you don't want that exactly i'm  saying can we  maintain excellence after these 10 15
NkT28jang70,6192000,6197280,years romantic exactly  and play happiness all these things  because to me
NkT28jang70,6197280,6204320,what is the point of being here if we  don't have it  if we're not operating at our highest  level what about what about
NkT28jang70,6204320,6209440,the saying that i hear  whether this is a meme or this is women
NkT28jang70,6209440,6214639,saying this online  maybe you know the line better than me
NkT28jang70,6214639,6222960,if he can't accept me at my worst he  doesn't deserve me  at my best i hate that
NkT28jang70,6223199,6230000,i absolutely hate it and i hate it  because  it it has turned into validation
NkT28jang70,6230000,6236560,for not addressing your flaws and issues  all right  i agree with it from the standpoint of
NkT28jang70,6236560,6243360,you've got to be able to handle your  partner's worst moments  all right because we're gonna all have  moments we're gonna all fall we're all
NkT28jang70,6243360,6249520,gonna do  make a mistake it's gonna happen over  time  that's just the way it is but when you
NkT28jang70,6249520,6254560,are essentially trying to say  i have a horrible flaw and you should
NkT28jang70,6254560,6260159,accept it  even when i want to consistently make  you deal with it  no that's not going to work for me
NkT28jang70,6260159,6265600,that's i can't accept that that's not  that's not okay and so a lot of people  that's what they're turning it into
NkT28jang70,6265600,6271360,that's you not taking accountability and  responsibility is that growth  going back to uh okay this is where i'm
NkT28jang70,6271360,6278480,at i don't want to address it  you just have to accept it and or don't  be with me  exactly you know it reminds me of like
NkT28jang70,6278480,6284080,once i don't know if they still say it  but i know at one time  people would say arguing is healthy for
NkT28jang70,6284080,6291520,a relationship  all right i decided i don't know if i  agree  i understand that yeah i just don't like
NkT28jang70,6291520,6296800,that no  at all can you can you communicate with  with we don't agree on this but do you  have to argue
NkT28jang70,6296800,6303040,exactly that's my thing  disagreement is acceptable disrespect is
NkT28jang70,6303040,6309920,not  all right so say one more time  disagreement is acceptable  disrespect is not that's good all right
NkT28jang70,6309920,6315520,so my thing is yes  it's okay and even healthy to have  disagreements because we have different
NkT28jang70,6315520,6320800,perspectives  we can bounce ideas off each other we  simply have to know how to navigate that
NkT28jang70,6320800,6328159,and come to an official decision on  things when we have those moments  but arguing arguing says we are being
NkT28jang70,6328159,6334480,disrespectful whether our tone is  negative  the words that we're using you know  we're getting loud we're getting angry
NkT28jang70,6334480,6340719,we're  we're basically throwing negative energy  at our partner  that's not healthy there's nothing
NkT28jang70,6340719,6346239,healthy about that  but a lot of people will say that  because they want to validate the
NkT28jang70,6346239,6352000,unhealthiness in their relationship  they don't want to face the issue of i  need to learn how to talk to my partner
NkT28jang70,6352000,6358480,better  i don't want to have to fix my tone why  do i have to watch what i say  because that's what an adult does wow
NkT28jang70,6358480,6363520,all right grow up  you know like i'm sorry to anyone  listening to this but that's just real
NkT28jang70,6363520,6370639,we we can't just think it's okay  especially with our partners  to speak however we want to to throw all
NkT28jang70,6370639,6376719,kinds of insults to be disrespectful and  think this is okay  because what people are not realizing is
NkT28jang70,6376719,6382400,all it takes is that one  really bad argument to plan a seed of  negativity that now
NkT28jang70,6382400,6388800,grows into something worse in the  relationship a lot of people's  issues are not the issue that they're
NkT28jang70,6388800,6396159,facing in that current moment  it's the culmination of all kinds of  things before then  it's the build up from that last time
NkT28jang70,6396159,6401679,you disrespected me  or made me feel some kind of way and  ever since then i've resented you
NkT28jang70,6401679,6407840,and now in this resentment i've given  you an attitude you didn't know what the  attitude was about because i didn't  communicate clearly
NkT28jang70,6407840,6412960,now you're giving me attitude and now  you see how it turns into other things  now that attitude turns into
NkT28jang70,6412960,6419360,not having sex with each other that  attitude turns into  okay uh the way that we talk to each  other in in general
NkT28jang70,6419360,6424719,maybe becoming secretive because now we  don't like dealing with each other  anymore  and what you don't realize is it started
NkT28jang70,6424719,6430080,from disrespectful  arguing wow all right it can also start  from some other stuff
NkT28jang70,6430080,6435679,all right but the arguing is a huge  problem for a lot of people  and we can't just keep sweeping under
NkT28jang70,6435679,6442159,the rug so going back to your point  about the whole  uh take me as at my worst yes
NkT28jang70,6442159,6448719,worst moment always like this yes  once in a while a good attitude exactly
NkT28jang70,6448719,6456639,consistent negative behavior has to be  addressed and corrected  so arguments are disrespect
NkT28jang70,6456639,6461840,but disagreements is okay is that yes  this agreement is acceptable disrespect  is not
NkT28jang70,6461840,6467280,yes so you can always disagree and you  can agree to not agree  yeah or you can is it right agreed to
NkT28jang70,6467280,6473199,disagree yeah agree to disagree  but you but what i'm hearing you say is  that arguing
NkT28jang70,6473199,6479760,uh saying what's on your mind in an  angry  exact aggressive way tearing down a
NkT28jang70,6479760,6486000,partner  is never going to do anything good for  someone exactly  people have to understand whenever
NkT28jang70,6486000,6491600,someone feels attacked they will defend  themselves  even if they know they're wrong even if
NkT28jang70,6491600,6498639,the point you're making is  actually solid the way you're coming at  them  negates their ability to receive it
NkT28jang70,6498639,6504880,that's why even me as a speaker  my focus has been do i want to be heard  or do i want people to receive my
NkT28jang70,6504880,6511040,message  all right if i want to be heard i can  speak however i want  i can be blatant with the insults i can
NkT28jang70,6511040,6516560,cut people down  i can just make jokes of everybody's  situation because it's just  entertainment i just want to be
NkT28jang70,6516560,6521679,heard but no i want people to receive it  and if i want people to receive it i  have to be more considerate
NkT28jang70,6521679,6527360,more compassionate i have to check my  tone i have to be careful with my words  and that's why people watch my videos to
NkT28jang70,6527360,6533679,see i try to be very careful with my  words  because i want you to receive what i'm  saying so if we're in a relationship we
NkT28jang70,6533679,6539520,have to take that approach  if you want them to hear you be mindful  of how you're talking to them
NkT28jang70,6539520,6544560,why is it so hard for people because  again they don't they don't want to face
NkT28jang70,6544560,6550400,the the or they don't want to do the  work of correction  all right and the work of correction can
NkT28jang70,6550400,6556000,entail the healing  and again facing those issues um it's  also conditioning
NkT28jang70,6556000,6562480,if people have been brought up in  households and environments where this  is how they talk to each other  it's it's very hard to change yeah yeah
NkT28jang70,6562480,6569119,it's foreign to now speak  in a more loving and positive way it's  foreign to sit and be quiet and listen
NkT28jang70,6569119,6577199,all right so now they have to reprogram  themselves and that's a lot of work  um and and i think also the acceptance
NkT28jang70,6577199,6582960,of  the way you're communicating is wrong  people don't like to face that they were  wrong
NkT28jang70,6582960,6588880,they don't want to have to accept that  so it's no i have to dig a  even deeper hole and and and stick with
NkT28jang70,6588880,6594960,this whole  negative approach of how i do things  because know that there's nothing wrong  with this  or i see other people do it you know
NkT28jang70,6594960,6600400,they're fine no they're not fine  they're not okay you know so i think  those reasons
NkT28jang70,6600400,6606000,just overall they don't want to have to  do the work and so  they rather make excuses for it so it
NkT28jang70,6606000,6613440,sounds like again  we go back to step one healing  if you can learn to heal you can start
NkT28jang70,6613440,6620000,to improve the quality of your choices  dating someone in a relationship or  getting out quicker you can be a
NkT28jang70,6620000,6625760,better more effective communicator in  relationships whether you're dating or  in a long-term community relationship
NkT28jang70,6625760,6631199,you can have a better relationship  overall with yourself when you heal and
NkT28jang70,6631199,6637119,with someone else so can you give me a  a breakdown a boot camp 101 on how to
NkT28jang70,6637119,6642960,recognize what you need to heal and then  how to start healing that  what does that look like for someone
NkT28jang70,6642960,6648639,okay i need to heal stefan  what do you mean by that how do i do it  how do i get started
NkT28jang70,6648639,6653760,how long does it take to get healed okay  is this a lifelong journey is this  overnight what does it look like all
NkT28jang70,6653760,6659599,right so first thing  how long does it take to heal it's going  to take as long as you're willing to put
NkT28jang70,6659599,6665440,into work  healing is not a time thing it's a work  thing so  when you hear people say time heals all
NkT28jang70,6665440,6672639,wounds no it doesn't time alone doesn't  heal a damn thing all right it can help  it does aid in the process but by itself
NkT28jang70,6672639,6679360,it is no good you have to take certain  steps  um so when people think well i'm gonna  take a year off from relationships to
NkT28jang70,6679360,6684719,heal  why a year and if you're not doing the  work in that year that year means
NkT28jang70,6684719,6690159,nothing and that's what happens to a lot  of people  they took a year off but what they did  was they hid from the world they hid
NkT28jang70,6690159,6695280,from relationships  they went in their corner all right and  distracted themselves but they never
NkT28jang70,6695280,6701679,healed  now they come back out of that year and  they're still the same person  or maybe they're not the same maybe the
NkT28jang70,6701679,6707599,first few months of dating  they're a little different but then they  fall back exactly because they never  resolved things
NkT28jang70,6707599,6714719,at its core now in terms of recognizing  what to heal  uh my first step is it's called the who
NkT28jang70,6714719,6719760,hurt me list  all right so you get a piece of paper  you write down a piece of paper who hurt  me
NkT28jang70,6719760,6725599,and now every person who comes to mind  you write them down on the piece of  paper  it doesn't matter how long ago it
NkT28jang70,6725599,6731119,happened doesn't matter if you think  you've moved past it  if you think it's not relevant if they  come to mind
NkT28jang70,6731119,6736880,then there's some level of relevance  there put them on the paper in about  a sentence or two of what they did to
NkT28jang70,6736880,6742080,hurt you all right  this is how we're going to start to  locate what you've been holding on to
NkT28jang70,6742080,6748880,but you really got to go into this  exercise very genuine  you can't be trying to control the  narrative you just got to let yourself
NkT28jang70,6748880,6756159,feel just ask yourself the question  close your eyes  let it come out what's the question i  should ask who heard me that's it
NkT28jang70,6756159,6763199,that's it and what it's like i can only  think of like three people that really  hurt me  should it be thinking of like every
NkT28jang70,6763199,6769599,instant they can think of from childhood  of that one comment or should this be  this person punch me in the face anybody
NkT28jang70,6769599,6775920,who comes to mind  so i don't want him to force it but i  don't want him to under  undermine it in any kind of way either
NkT28jang70,6775920,6781840,just whoever comes to mind  put them on the paper because even if  there's a situation where you forgot
NkT28jang70,6781840,6787040,somebody  if we tackle the big ones you're not  gonna be able to escape the big ones the  big ones are gonna come out they're
NkT28jang70,6787040,6792960,gonna come to mind  if we can tackle those then that might  set the stage where everything else gets  taken care of naturally sure sure all
NkT28jang70,6792960,6798239,right because now your awareness is  going to be there  and your level of healing will allow you  to see things differently because really
NkT28jang70,6798239,6804000,the big ones might be the ones that  cause the most pain and if you heal that  the other ones are just
NkT28jang70,6804000,6809119,a pattern of the pain exactly and you  will also start to perceive those  situations differently
NkT28jang70,6809119,6815280,once you feel from the bigger ones okay  so that's step one take take a piece of  paper  write it out how long should this take a
NkT28jang70,6815280,6821280,few minutes  a few hours depending depending on the  person because you know for some people  it's going to get heavy
NkT28jang70,6821280,6826320,it's going to get heavy and that might  cause them to want to pause  and take a step back but i would
NkT28jang70,6826320,6832000,encourage them do not like walk away  from it completely  stick to it but it can be as quick as a
NkT28jang70,6832000,6839920,few minutes  maybe it takes an hour because they may  get emotional in the process  but just don't run from it um but just
NkT28jang70,6839920,6847679,just do it don't even worry about the  time just do it okay step one  step two step two so step two i'm gonna
NkT28jang70,6847679,6854000,lay this out i usually lay it out but  you know what i feel like i gotta do it  today bring it i gotta do it today so  step two we gotta get things off our
NkT28jang70,6854000,6859440,chest all right okay and this is where  we do the letter writing process  so there the there's two parts of the
NkT28jang70,6859440,6864960,letter two drafts  the first draft is the most important  this is where we're gonna have
NkT28jang70,6864960,6871119,essentially an emotional detox we gotta  get everything out so let's say  on the list is your mother i always
NkT28jang70,6871119,6879360,bring up mothers because  so many people have mommy issues but the  world only wants to talk about daddy  issues  all right and the society has made it to
NkT28jang70,6879360,6885040,where it's almost  wrong for you to tell a woman she was a  bad mother or to criticize your mother
NkT28jang70,6885040,6891360,so we suppress that a lot more than we  do our father it's interesting  you know so let's say it's your mother
NkT28jang70,6891360,6896560,and um  you're gonna do the first draft and in  that first drive you're just gonna let
NkT28jang70,6896560,6902000,all your raw emotion out i don't care if  you curse her out  i don't care if you wish death on her i
NkT28jang70,6902000,6907520,don't care what nasty evil thing you say  however you feel let it come out
NkT28jang70,6907520,6912719,you've got to let the anger the hurt all  pour out of you  into this letter if you don't know how
NkT28jang70,6912719,6919119,to start the letter start it with  the most damning thing you could say all  right i hate you because
NkT28jang70,6919119,6924159,boom and then just go from there it's  gonna start coming out once you uncork  that screw
NkT28jang70,6924159,6930239,that's it exactly and this is where it  gets heavier a lot of people may take a  lot more pauses in this process
NkT28jang70,6930239,6935599,all right because again so many people  have been suppressing this for so  long and again it's like any other detox
NkT28jang70,6935599,6941599,when you start to detox  the bad stuff has to come out first yeah  all right and you can't get to a heal
NkT28jang70,6941599,6948800,place unless you flush out all the  negative energy  so this is why it's important this is  not the draft to be politically correct
NkT28jang70,6948800,6954639,to to try to frame things in the right  way i don't want you to be considerate  i don't want you to think about well i
NkT28jang70,6954639,6959679,did some wrong things to forget all that  this first draft is let it rip let it
NkT28jang70,6959679,6965119,rip  let it out and i guarantee you by just  doing that first draft  you're going to feel better you're going
NkT28jang70,6965119,6974320,to feel a weight come off your shoulders  you're going to feel more peace to you  right that's the draft one drop drop two
NkT28jang70,6974320,6979920,so drive two is essentially now i always  tell people all right you finish draft  one
NkT28jang70,6979920,6986239,pray meditate whatever you gotta do just  get to a kind of level  place mentally calm and now
NkT28jang70,6986239,6993119,read the letter to yourself as if you  were them  oh okay and now
NkT28jang70,6993119,7000320,so put yourself in their shoes and  anything that now comes off as attacking  condescending blatantly insulting you're
NkT28jang70,7000320,7006159,going to  change it you're not changing the  message you're just changing your  delivery of the message
NkT28jang70,7006159,7012159,all right and the importance behind this  is twofold one  we talked about it earlier people don't
NkT28jang70,7012159,7017360,know how to communicate without being  negative  they're tone their delivery is horrible
NkT28jang70,7017360,7024560,so this letter is going to help you  learn how to take your negative emotions  and thoughts and now  turn it and reword it into a much more
NkT28jang70,7024560,7030400,loving positive message  now loving positive does not mean you  won't say some things that aren't
NkT28jang70,7030400,7035840,hurtful to them or a hard pill for them  to swallow  there's just a difference between
NkT28jang70,7035840,7041040,lashing out and expressing how you feel  saying this is how you impacted my life
NkT28jang70,7041040,7047520,this is how i perceive things  right then you're this you're that  you're this that's the first draft  but the second draft is just you're just
NkT28jang70,7047520,7053520,changing your delivery of the message  so by the end of it you have fully  expressed yourself
NkT28jang70,7053520,7058880,but in a more calm loving manner  this is going to allow one is going to
NkT28jang70,7058880,7065119,teach you how to be better in your  communication interesting  but also this is the part people aren't  going to like and
NkT28jang70,7065119,7070639,and i won't go too deep into this part  for those who may have to send it and i  would just suggest getting the book to
NkT28jang70,7070639,7075760,see they got to send them that all right  because it breaks all of this down but  for those who do have to send it
NkT28jang70,7075760,7081920,it's going to give you a much greater  chance of great things to come from that  letter  not that that's the focus of the letter
NkT28jang70,7081920,7087199,the focus of the letter is for your  healing  so i don't care if you did send it and  they never responded
NkT28jang70,7087199,7092880,i don't care if they said if you sent it  and they rejected everything you said in  it  because the purpose is your release of
NkT28jang70,7092880,7099119,all those emotions all right and you've  got to embrace forgiveness and  forgiveness is another piece of this  healing puzzle forgiving them and
NkT28jang70,7099119,7104560,forgiving yourself as well  that's the real focus but i have seen  amazing things
NkT28jang70,7104560,7110880,happen because of these letters really  yeah people receiving them  yes i've seen so these are not these are
NkT28jang70,7110880,7116400,not letters that you send out that say  you're horrible you ruined my life  that's not draft one you're sending out
NkT28jang70,7116400,7122560,draft two which is more of a  place of this is how this scenario  impacted me  yeah this is how you're taking me more
NkT28jang70,7122560,7128800,of a responsibility as well how it made  me feel  is that i'm hearing you absolutely yeah  because it's very different to accuse
NkT28jang70,7128800,7136400,someone and attack someone versus saying  but this is how i received it  right whether you're right or wrong  exactly because also understand this
NkT28jang70,7136400,7142560,hurt people hurt people and and some  people  reject that because they say well i'm  hurt and i never hurt nobody that's a
NkT28jang70,7142560,7148560,lie  whether you realize it or not you have  hurt people  one example i'll give that comes to mind
NkT28jang70,7148560,7155360,let's say you're a woman or a man  and you were hurt in your last  relationship and now you've become  guarded now to you you're still
NkT28jang70,7155360,7161840,operating as a loving human being but  what you don't realize is your  gardenness  is still hurting either the potential
NkT28jang70,7161840,7167520,partner or someone that you do get with  because you're unwilling to give them  your whole heart wow all right
NkT28jang70,7167520,7173599,so you still you're not you're not  attacking them maybe you're not  punching them or cheating on them but
NkT28jang70,7173599,7178800,you're holding back  exactly and you're still undermining the  relationship
NkT28jang70,7178800,7184080,so you're still hurting them and you're  hurting yourself because you're not  allowing yourself to experience the full
NkT28jang70,7184080,7189760,greatness of it because you won't fully  dive in  because you're scared and you're guarded
NkT28jang70,7189760,7197520,and that has to be fixed  but going back to the original problem i  want to make is  in that same mode the hurt person does
NkT28jang70,7197520,7203520,not always  realize how much they're hurting you  we have to understand that damaged
NkT28jang70,7203520,7209520,individuals are operating from a very  selfish mindset  it's i'm protecting myself think about
NkT28jang70,7209520,7215280,the person who is  overly critical of everyone else they're  always criticizing criticizing  criticizing
NkT28jang70,7215280,7222000,they're not doing it because their  intention is to hurt others  they're doing it because they want to  keep the spotlight off of them and to
NkT28jang70,7222000,7227440,protect themselves from criticism  so i'm going to hit you before you hit  me dang all right
NkT28jang70,7227440,7233520,so again a lot of our parents the things  that they did  they did not understand and even if they
NkT28jang70,7233520,7239040,had some  semblance of an idea they're so caught  up in their own feelings they're blinded
NkT28jang70,7239040,7245280,by it  so a lot of times this letter basically  takes the blinders off  when you do it in that loving manner
NkT28jang70,7245280,7250400,because like i said earlier do you want  to be heard or do you want them to  receive the message
NkT28jang70,7250400,7255440,the yelling the screaming the lashing  out they heard that because you may have  done that with them in the past
NkT28jang70,7255440,7262480,but they never received you in that  moment now  expressing yourself in a calm loving  manner they can't help but receive you
NkT28jang70,7262480,7268480,and even those who reject what you're  saying  trust me it has hit them in a way  nothing else has
NkT28jang70,7268480,7274080,in a relationship you are on  thin ice and the sun is coming out
NkT28jang70,7274080,7280400,because  right right right because again what
NkT28jang70,7280400,7285920,happens is  you're not free you're not free you're  not actually
NkT28jang70,7285920,7289360,giving from your heart
