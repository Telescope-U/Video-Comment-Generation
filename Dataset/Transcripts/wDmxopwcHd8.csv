wDmxopwcHd8,82479,84000,whenever i show off stuff like this in
wDmxopwcHd8,84000,85759,this series always does really really
wDmxopwcHd8,85759,86479,well
wDmxopwcHd8,86479,88799,this is a six in one desktop or
wDmxopwcHd8,88799,91200,nightstand docking station that is just
wDmxopwcHd8,91200,93040,jam-packed with features
wDmxopwcHd8,93040,94720,first has a built-in lamp with three
wDmxopwcHd8,94720,96159,different color temperatures and
wDmxopwcHd8,96159,97520,adjustable brightness with a touch
wDmxopwcHd8,97520,99439,sensitive button on the front it then
wDmxopwcHd8,99439,101360,has this nifty removable charging pod
wDmxopwcHd8,101360,103680,that doubles as an airpods charger works
wDmxopwcHd8,103680,105920,with any generation as well plus on the
wDmxopwcHd8,105920,107600,front is the magnetic charger for an
wDmxopwcHd8,107600,109520,apple watch then you have the wireless
wDmxopwcHd8,109520,111200,charging pad on the top base of the
wDmxopwcHd8,111200,113200,stand that works both with and without a
wDmxopwcHd8,113200,114960,phone case by the way which is always
wDmxopwcHd8,114960,116799,nice this is all in addition obviously
wDmxopwcHd8,116799,119119,to it being a digital clock and alarm so
wDmxopwcHd8,119119,121439,six total use cases here it's a nice and
wDmxopwcHd8,121439,123360,compact build as well that all runs and
wDmxopwcHd8,123360,126000,powers off of one cable so all of this
wDmxopwcHd8,126000,127280,without the need of having five
wDmxopwcHd8,127280,129119,different cables running out of it like
wDmxopwcHd8,129119,131120,i said use this on your desktop or what
wDmxopwcHd8,131120,132879,i think is the best fit for it a
wDmxopwcHd8,132879,134400,nightstand there is just nothing more
wDmxopwcHd8,134400,135920,convenient than having one station
wDmxopwcHd8,135920,138000,charge all your devices at once at the
wDmxopwcHd8,138000,139680,end of the day come home instead of
wDmxopwcHd8,139680,141599,charging each device individually dock
wDmxopwcHd8,141599,142959,them up here and it'll be all fully
wDmxopwcHd8,142959,144080,charged in the morning these are
wDmxopwcHd8,144080,146080,available in a white and a green color
wDmxopwcHd8,146080,147680,as well but i picked it up in black
wDmxopwcHd8,147680,148959,since it's more neutral for the
wDmxopwcHd8,148959,150640,nightstand and i think it makes the
wDmxopwcHd8,150640,152800,clock and the lamp pop a bit more as for
wDmxopwcHd8,152800,154959,the pricing more than fare i picked it
wDmxopwcHd8,154959,157200,up for 40 bucks listed down below like
wDmxopwcHd8,157200,159040,everything else today a great buy for
wDmxopwcHd8,159040,161040,not only yourself but a good gift idea
wDmxopwcHd8,161040,163280,for someone may i add by the way as i
wDmxopwcHd8,163280,164560,said before everything today will be
wDmxopwcHd8,164560,166239,listed for you in the description but
wDmxopwcHd8,166239,168080,also i'm gonna have a link to my luster
wDmxopwcHd8,168080,171120,profile which has archived every single
wDmxopwcHd8,171120,172959,product that i showed off on the series
wDmxopwcHd8,172959,174959,for the past three years now so you can
wDmxopwcHd8,174959,177040,all have it there right in front of you
wDmxopwcHd8,177040,178640,check out all the previous cool tech
wDmxopwcHd8,178640,179760,products
wDmxopwcHd8,179760,182080,now for a pretty cool desktop gadget
wDmxopwcHd8,182080,185040,this is a glass whiteboard wedge and
wDmxopwcHd8,185040,187040,sort of a shelf this can sit on your
wDmxopwcHd8,187040,189120,desk you can easily jot down some quick
wDmxopwcHd8,189120,191280,notes or ideas or whatever and use it
wDmxopwcHd8,191280,193200,also then for storage it comes with a
wDmxopwcHd8,193200,195840,dry erase marker an eraser and a notepad
wDmxopwcHd8,195840,197599,as well which is pretty nice on the top
wDmxopwcHd8,197599,199120,of the device there's also lip for
wDmxopwcHd8,199120,201040,storing like pens your phone have a
wDmxopwcHd8,201040,202800,tablet on display there's a marker
wDmxopwcHd8,202800,204480,holder as well but considering we show
wDmxopwcHd8,204480,206000,off numerous stuff on this series
wDmxopwcHd8,206000,207760,including things your desktop i thought
wDmxopwcHd8,207760,209440,this would be a pretty cool fit i really
wDmxopwcHd8,209440,211440,like it it's pretty compact as well for
wDmxopwcHd8,211440,213599,everything it offers it's just under 16
wDmxopwcHd8,213599,215280,inches long and seven inches in depth
wDmxopwcHd8,215280,216640,this will definitely be great for that
wDmxopwcHd8,216640,218000,work from home setup where you really
wDmxopwcHd8,218000,220159,want to jot down those important notes
wDmxopwcHd8,220159,222720,from a call or a meeting maybe even just
wDmxopwcHd8,222720,224799,your to-do list i don't have to explain
wDmxopwcHd8,224799,226560,a whiteboard to you you pretty much get
wDmxopwcHd8,226560,229040,the idea by now emphasis on jotting down
wDmxopwcHd8,229040,231200,important notes so to match it to your
wDmxopwcHd8,231200,232640,setup's theme as you've seen you can
wDmxopwcHd8,232640,234319,pick it up neither a black or a white
wDmxopwcHd8,234319,236560,glass option i also saw it in pink as
wDmxopwcHd8,236560,238799,well but also this particular model that
wDmxopwcHd8,238799,240319,i'm listening down below is one of the
wDmxopwcHd8,240319,242640,only ones i've seen that doesn't have
wDmxopwcHd8,242640,244560,obnoxious branding on it this is all
wDmxopwcHd8,244560,247920,branding free and it's just 30 bucks
wDmxopwcHd8,247920,250640,next is a nifty little find this is an
wDmxopwcHd8,250640,253040,acrylic stand that has
wDmxopwcHd8,253040,254400,some spotlights
wDmxopwcHd8,254400,256720,built in put things on display
wDmxopwcHd8,256720,258479,so when i saw this it's pretty much
wDmxopwcHd8,258479,260880,advertised for like putting your model
wDmxopwcHd8,260880,263040,cars on display but obviously the
wDmxopwcHd8,263040,265280,keyboard lover in me and as someone who
wDmxopwcHd8,265280,267280,has numerous keyboards around the studio
wDmxopwcHd8,267280,268639,this would be a really nice display
wDmxopwcHd8,268639,270479,piece if you want to hold one of those
wDmxopwcHd8,270479,273280,in terms of size it's roughly 14 by 6 by
wDmxopwcHd8,273280,275759,6 so if you have like a 60 or a 65 for
wDmxopwcHd8,275759,278080,example it'll fit in here very nicely
wDmxopwcHd8,278080,280000,and having the four led spotlights in
wDmxopwcHd8,280000,281199,each corner was kind of you know
wDmxopwcHd8,281199,282639,illuminate it a little bit then you have
wDmxopwcHd8,282639,284560,the acrylic top piece keep it all
wDmxopwcHd8,284560,286479,protected from dust and stuff this can
wDmxopwcHd8,286479,288240,be powered by batteries but there is a
wDmxopwcHd8,288240,290080,micro usb slot if you want you can just
wDmxopwcHd8,290080,291840,plug in a cable and have it constantly
wDmxopwcHd8,291840,293600,running that way and the lights just
wDmxopwcHd8,293600,295280,snap in and out of place so if you don't
wDmxopwcHd8,295280,296800,even want them in there you could easily
wDmxopwcHd8,296800,299440,remove them or pop them back in voila
wDmxopwcHd8,299440,301199,and again even though it advertised all
wDmxopwcHd8,301199,303440,those model cars and stuff whatever you
wDmxopwcHd8,303440,305199,want to put on display you can whether
wDmxopwcHd8,305199,307120,it's certain collectibles you have if
wDmxopwcHd8,307120,308720,you got a bunch of gaming mice or your
wDmxopwcHd8,308720,310320,custom keyboards so whatever you can
wDmxopwcHd8,310320,312240,think of whatever you want to keep nice
wDmxopwcHd8,312240,314880,and protected and illuminated have it on
wDmxopwcHd8,314880,317280,display with this stand i picked it up
wDmxopwcHd8,317280,320240,for just around 39 bucks i believe
wDmxopwcHd8,320240,322639,next is the asus strix portable m.2
wDmxopwcHd8,322639,325680,enclosure this lets you use an m.2 pcie
wDmxopwcHd8,325680,329199,nvme ssd pretty much as an external hard
wDmxopwcHd8,329199,331600,drive just send the whole alphabet there
wDmxopwcHd8,331600,333759,so say you have a spare n.2 drive or you
wDmxopwcHd8,333759,335199,just want to take advantage of the
wDmxopwcHd8,335199,337199,speeds and use it to you know bring
wDmxopwcHd8,337199,339039,along with you on the go for example
wDmxopwcHd8,339039,341440,this will easily let you do so and since
wDmxopwcHd8,341440,343039,it's from a major gaming company like
wDmxopwcHd8,343039,345919,asus you know it's got rgb which isn't
wDmxopwcHd8,345919,348720,necessary at all but the logo and the
wDmxopwcHd8,348720,350560,top piece of acrylic there have rgb
wDmxopwcHd8,350560,352400,lighting shining so you could just use
wDmxopwcHd8,352400,354000,their armory crate software to control
wDmxopwcHd8,354000,356240,it if you want but i just let it do its
wDmxopwcHd8,356240,357759,thing and i don't have the software it's
wDmxopwcHd8,357759,359600,not necessary at all now in terms of
wDmxopwcHd8,359600,361280,speeds with the enclosure you'll get
wDmxopwcHd8,361280,363680,around 900 megabytes a second transfer
wDmxopwcHd8,363680,365600,which yes is less than if you had the
wDmxopwcHd8,365600,367759,n.2 installed into your motherboard but
wDmxopwcHd8,367759,370240,that is still crazy fast considering if
wDmxopwcHd8,370240,372560,you were to use an ssd for example which
wDmxopwcHd8,372560,374319,just a few years ago was considered
wDmxopwcHd8,374319,376080,lightning quick this was typically right
wDmxopwcHd8,376080,378639,around under 600 megabytes so nearly a
wDmxopwcHd8,378639,380800,full gig a second here installed i have
wDmxopwcHd8,380800,382319,a two terabyte drive which is pretty
wDmxopwcHd8,382319,384560,much just acting as my digital library
wDmxopwcHd8,384560,386639,for all my video files and every youtube
wDmxopwcHd8,386639,388880,video i've made backed up onto here in
wDmxopwcHd8,388880,390160,case i need to use them again in a
wDmxopwcHd8,390160,392560,future video and with this drive lets me
wDmxopwcHd8,392560,394720,store it all while looking sleek the
wDmxopwcHd8,394720,397120,asus rog strix ariane light comes in a
wDmxopwcHd8,397120,399520,penny under 50. and then lastly today i
wDmxopwcHd8,399520,401440,know steam decks are still shipping or
wDmxopwcHd8,401440,402720,maybe you're hoping to get one in the
wDmxopwcHd8,402720,404479,future but i'm gonna say this is a
wDmxopwcHd8,404479,406720,must-have accessory and it's so so
wDmxopwcHd8,406720,408880,simple so you see these two touch pads
wDmxopwcHd8,408880,411039,right these are admittedly underused in
wDmxopwcHd8,411039,412880,most games but i like to change the
wDmxopwcHd8,412880,414720,layout in games i can use these instead
wDmxopwcHd8,414720,416639,of the joysticks because it just feels
wDmxopwcHd8,416639,418080,better and more natural to use in your
wDmxopwcHd8,418080,420400,hand to overall size the steam deck the
wDmxopwcHd8,420400,423039,problem though is the entire device is
wDmxopwcHd8,423039,425039,all the same plastic material and these
wDmxopwcHd8,425039,427440,touch pads don't offer that fine control
wDmxopwcHd8,427440,429120,so solution is going to be adding these
wDmxopwcHd8,429120,430960,skins from dbrand with the main
wDmxopwcHd8,430960,433440,highlight being their matrix skins that
wDmxopwcHd8,433440,435680,has this really nice but subtle textures
wDmxopwcHd8,435680,437599,to them that once applied it gets a
wDmxopwcHd8,437599,439440,really great necessary feel to the touch
wDmxopwcHd8,439440,441280,pads in addition to the matrix skins i
wDmxopwcHd8,441280,443440,also picked up a seafoam green skin for
wDmxopwcHd8,443440,444880,the top of the device here just to give
wDmxopwcHd8,444880,446880,it some color i think the seafoam looks
wDmxopwcHd8,446880,448720,really nice as you can see i just think
wDmxopwcHd8,448720,450160,it makes it look better in terms of the
wDmxopwcHd8,450160,452160,aesthetics but the main highlight here
wDmxopwcHd8,452160,454400,are those matrix skins and like i said
wDmxopwcHd8,454400,456800,for that extra grip and just control on
wDmxopwcHd8,456800,459280,these touch pads these are fantastic i
wDmxopwcHd8,459280,460639,really feel like valve should have had
wDmxopwcHd8,460639,462479,these touch pads you know just be some
wDmxopwcHd8,462479,464080,sort of different material or have an
wDmxopwcHd8,464080,466000,extra texture to them to differentiate
wDmxopwcHd8,466000,467680,it from the rest of the device so for
wDmxopwcHd8,467680,469840,just five dollars these matrix touchpad
wDmxopwcHd8,469840,471680,skins from dbrand i think are a
wDmxopwcHd8,471680,473680,must-have accessory that makes it feel
wDmxopwcHd8,473680,476080,great look great and it's such a simple
wDmxopwcHd8,476080,477759,upgrade of course they have different
wDmxopwcHd8,477759,479680,colors and materials to pick from but i
wDmxopwcHd8,479680,481599,think the matrix ones are the way to go
wDmxopwcHd8,481599,482879,if you want skins for the rest of your
wDmxopwcHd8,482879,484639,device they have the front and back for
wDmxopwcHd8,484639,486960,your steam deck just under forty dollars
wDmxopwcHd8,486960,489199,total configure it however you like but
wDmxopwcHd8,489199,491680,man a simple five dollar upgrade for
wDmxopwcHd8,491680,492479,sure
wDmxopwcHd8,492479,494800,so while skins aren't the most exciting
wDmxopwcHd8,494800,496879,thing you know in this case here showing
wDmxopwcHd8,496879,500000,it off today definitely justified looks
wDmxopwcHd8,500000,501759,nice and really does serve a purpose
wDmxopwcHd8,501759,504479,like i said for those touch pads and the
wDmxopwcHd8,504479,507520,extra added grip and control
wDmxopwcHd8,507520,509680,definitely a killer addition to a steam
wDmxopwcHd8,509680,510479,deck
