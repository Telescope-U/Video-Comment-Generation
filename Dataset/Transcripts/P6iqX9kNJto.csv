P6iqX9kNJto,80,1599,been a little while since we've talked
P6iqX9kNJto,1599,3520,tech around here so in today's video i
P6iqX9kNJto,3520,5839,wanted to share some of my favorite kind
P6iqX9kNJto,5839,9200,of current daily use tech items all
P6iqX9kNJto,9200,10320,under 100
P6iqX9kNJto,10320,12160,we've got a bit of an eclectic mix today
P6iqX9kNJto,12160,14719,with some home tech office tech outdoor
P6iqX9kNJto,14719,17279,and travel tech music production so
P6iqX9kNJto,17279,19279,without any further ado let's just dive
P6iqX9kNJto,19279,20400,into it
P6iqX9kNJto,20400,23600,first up we have a mechanical keyboard
P6iqX9kNJto,23600,27039,this is the vissels v84 mechanical
P6iqX9kNJto,27039,29199,keyboard i've been using this for a
P6iqX9kNJto,29199,31199,couple of months switching from the
P6iqX9kNJto,31199,33680,apple magic keyboard and have been
P6iqX9kNJto,33680,35840,thoroughly impressed with it uh they
P6iqX9kNJto,35840,38160,sent it out for me to test and review
P6iqX9kNJto,38160,40000,and yeah the past couple of months have
P6iqX9kNJto,40000,41680,been great this thing's only a hundred
P6iqX9kNJto,41680,44000,dollars and it's actually on sale for 90
P6iqX9kNJto,44000,46079,on amazon right now the keycaps are
P6iqX9kNJto,46079,48320,fully hot swappable i decided to pick
P6iqX9kNJto,48320,50559,the blue switches but you can also get
P6iqX9kNJto,50559,53840,red or brown switches i love the clicky
P6iqX9kNJto,53840,56160,sound of the blues so i'm really happy i
P6iqX9kNJto,56160,59199,decided to go with that it's a 75
P6iqX9kNJto,59199,60640,size so it's not going to be a full
P6iqX9kNJto,60640,62719,keyboard with a full number pad it's
P6iqX9kNJto,62719,64960,really my only real disappointment i got
P6iqX9kNJto,64960,66720,used to having my full number pad on the
P6iqX9kNJto,66720,69280,magic keyboard and definitely enjoy that
P6iqX9kNJto,69280,71840,but the benefits and the joy of using a
P6iqX9kNJto,71840,73439,mechanical keyboard have definitely
P6iqX9kNJto,73439,76000,outweighed the cons for sure build
P6iqX9kNJto,76000,78159,quality for something so inexpensive has
P6iqX9kNJto,78159,80000,been surprising it's got a really nice
P6iqX9kNJto,80000,81680,weight to it like i said the keys are
P6iqX9kNJto,81680,84000,fully hot-swappable you can swap between
P6iqX9kNJto,84000,86159,mac or windows keys and they come with
P6iqX9kNJto,86159,88080,that it also comes with an included
P6iqX9kNJto,88080,90000,wrist rest and a really nice tool to be
P6iqX9kNJto,90000,92240,able to pull off key caps if you need or
P6iqX9kNJto,92240,94240,want to it's fully wireless has a pretty
P6iqX9kNJto,94240,96400,respectable battery life you have full
P6iqX9kNJto,96400,98960,rgb on the keys as well so you can do
P6iqX9kNJto,98960,101040,all the crazy rgb colors or you can do
P6iqX9kNJto,101040,103520,some more muted options i tend to like
P6iqX9kNJto,103520,106399,the warmer white kind of orange color
P6iqX9kNJto,106399,109040,keep that on all the time it looks great
P6iqX9kNJto,109040,111200,matches my like warm lighting in my
P6iqX9kNJto,111200,113360,office overall really impressed and i
P6iqX9kNJto,113360,115119,would happily recommend this for anyone
P6iqX9kNJto,115119,116799,that's looking to get into mechanical
P6iqX9kNJto,116799,118719,keyboards moving on from there i have an
P6iqX9kNJto,118719,121280,addition to my airpods pro that i've
P6iqX9kNJto,121280,123680,been thoroughly enjoying obviously the
P6iqX9kNJto,123680,125920,airpods pros are great i was using the
P6iqX9kNJto,125920,128239,sony link buds for the past four or five
P6iqX9kNJto,128239,130319,months or so since they came out to
P6iqX9kNJto,130319,132319,properly test and review them i'll
P6iqX9kNJto,132319,134720,probably be making a dedicated review
P6iqX9kNJto,134720,136160,for those at some point in the future i
P6iqX9kNJto,136160,138160,know a few people were interested but i
P6iqX9kNJto,138160,140080,have switched back to using my airpods
P6iqX9kNJto,140080,142400,pro for normal day-to-day use and one of
P6iqX9kNJto,142400,145200,the big reasons for that is switching to
P6iqX9kNJto,145200,147760,these comply foam ear tips compared to
P6iqX9kNJto,147760,149840,the silicon tips that it normally comes
P6iqX9kNJto,149840,150800,with
P6iqX9kNJto,150800,152400,i love the sound quality out of the air
P6iqX9kNJto,152400,154800,pods pros just about everything about
P6iqX9kNJto,154800,156640,them has been really great with the
P6iqX9kNJto,156640,159360,exception of the fit for me
P6iqX9kNJto,159360,160720,i was having some issues with them
P6iqX9kNJto,160720,162160,sliding out of my ears and just
P6iqX9kNJto,162160,164319,generally having to adjust them a lot
P6iqX9kNJto,164319,165840,throughout the day i looked into some
P6iqX9kNJto,165840,167680,options online and saw a lot of people
P6iqX9kNJto,167680,169920,recommending trying out foam ear tips so
P6iqX9kNJto,169920,172319,i bought some these are comply they're
P6iqX9kNJto,172319,175440,25 bucks for a pack of three on amazon
P6iqX9kNJto,175440,178319,and they completely transformed the fit
P6iqX9kNJto,178319,181200,of these way more than i ever expected
P6iqX9kNJto,181200,183200,they go in really easily they're even
P6iqX9kNJto,183200,185599,more comfortable to wear and i don't
P6iqX9kNJto,185599,187280,need to adjust them at all so if you're
P6iqX9kNJto,187280,189200,someone that you know wants all the
P6iqX9kNJto,189200,192000,benefits of some of the enclosed earbuds
P6iqX9kNJto,192000,193599,but kind of has trouble with the fit
P6iqX9kNJto,193599,195440,like i always have
P6iqX9kNJto,195440,197840,try out those foam ear tips really
P6iqX9kNJto,197840,200239,inexpensive and completely transformed
P6iqX9kNJto,200239,201920,how i use these so it's been really
P6iqX9kNJto,201920,203519,great going back to these after the link
P6iqX9kNJto,203519,204400,buds
P6iqX9kNJto,204400,206959,the sound quality is excellent for such
P6iqX9kNJto,206959,208959,a small pair of headphones on the topic
P6iqX9kNJto,208959,211280,for apple i wanted to once again mention
P6iqX9kNJto,211280,213200,the air tags i've talked about these
P6iqX9kNJto,213200,214640,before but it's definitely worth
P6iqX9kNJto,214640,216319,mentioning it's just a really great
P6iqX9kNJto,216319,218480,inexpensive thing to throw into your
P6iqX9kNJto,218480,221040,bags and your luggage and your car
P6iqX9kNJto,221040,223760,29 bucks and you can keep track of your
P6iqX9kNJto,223760,226239,items it's really great for security if
P6iqX9kNJto,226239,227680,you're traveling and want to throw one
P6iqX9kNJto,227680,229360,into your luggage just to be safe in
P6iqX9kNJto,229360,232239,case it gets lost in transit somehow you
P6iqX9kNJto,232239,233599,can kind of have a little bit better
P6iqX9kNJto,233599,235439,luck keeping track of things but i also
P6iqX9kNJto,235439,237360,like to keep on my sling bag in case i
P6iqX9kNJto,237360,239519,leave it at a restaurant or if it gets
P6iqX9kNJto,239519,241200,stolen or something like that so i keep
P6iqX9kNJto,241200,243200,on my backpack keep on my sling bag i
P6iqX9kNJto,243200,245439,actually keep one in my car as well as
P6iqX9kNJto,245439,247760,kind of a tracker for my car
P6iqX9kNJto,247760,249360,unfortunately there are a lot of car
P6iqX9kNJto,249360,251360,thefts in the city so it's just a little
P6iqX9kNJto,251360,253519,extra piece of protection that's
P6iqX9kNJto,253519,254400,inexpensive
P6iqX9kNJto,254400,256720,and easy and i really can't recommend
P6iqX9kNJto,256720,258479,them enough i picked up a four pack they
P6iqX9kNJto,258479,260160,were on sale a couple months ago on
P6iqX9kNJto,260160,262639,amazon discounted um i do think the
P6iqX9kNJto,262639,264160,single ones are discounted a little bit
P6iqX9kNJto,264160,266080,right now but it's 99 bucks for a pack
P6iqX9kNJto,266080,268120,of four or one for
P6iqX9kNJto,268120,271280,27.50 right now moving into the kitchen
P6iqX9kNJto,271280,273600,i wanted to take some time to talk about
P6iqX9kNJto,273600,276400,this it's the picoso coffee scale i
P6iqX9kNJto,276400,278160,think it's just a random off-brand one i
P6iqX9kNJto,278160,279600,had to look up what the brand was
P6iqX9kNJto,279600,281600,because it doesn't say on the outside or
P6iqX9kNJto,281600,284639,anything but this is a coffee scale and
P6iqX9kNJto,284639,287360,timer for 17
P6iqX9kNJto,287360,289120,if you're someone that really is into
P6iqX9kNJto,289120,290880,coffee and doing pour overs and
P6iqX9kNJto,290880,292720,different things like that like i am you
P6iqX9kNJto,292720,294560,know having a really accurate coffee
P6iqX9kNJto,294560,296720,scale is excellent having something that
P6iqX9kNJto,296720,299040,goes to the 10th of a gram is also
P6iqX9kNJto,299040,301520,incredibly helpful and having something
P6iqX9kNJto,301520,303600,that has a built-in timer is really
P6iqX9kNJto,303600,305520,convenient and nice to use instead of
P6iqX9kNJto,305520,307759,using your phone timer and i picked this
P6iqX9kNJto,307759,310000,up a few months ago and have just been
P6iqX9kNJto,310000,312080,really impressed with it for such a
P6iqX9kNJto,312080,315039,budget scale you know i deep dove into
P6iqX9kNJto,315039,316880,james hoffman's youtube channel trying
P6iqX9kNJto,316880,319280,to find a replacement scale for an old
P6iqX9kNJto,319280,321039,one i'd been using for about a decade
P6iqX9kNJto,321039,322479,that just really wasn't cutting it for
P6iqX9kNJto,322479,325199,me anymore and a lot of good quality
P6iqX9kNJto,325199,327759,coffee scales can be so expensive so i
P6iqX9kNJto,327759,329440,did some research and checked out some
P6iqX9kNJto,329440,330880,budget options
P6iqX9kNJto,330880,333199,and found this one i love the look of it
P6iqX9kNJto,333199,334560,too that's something that you don't
P6iqX9kNJto,334560,336880,normally get with such budget scales so
P6iqX9kNJto,336880,338800,it looks great it's been really accurate
P6iqX9kNJto,338800,341120,for me the timer's excellent you have
P6iqX9kNJto,341120,343440,touch screen buttons on here but they
P6iqX9kNJto,343440,345039,actually work really well i've had some
P6iqX9kNJto,345039,346880,problems with scales in the past with
P6iqX9kNJto,346880,348160,the touchscreen not being very
P6iqX9kNJto,348160,349680,responsive
P6iqX9kNJto,349680,351840,but yeah zero complaints for this if you
P6iqX9kNJto,351840,353680,had told me this was like 80 or 100
P6iqX9kNJto,353680,356639,bucks i wouldn't be surprised it's been
P6iqX9kNJto,356639,359039,absolutely perfect for me since i got it
P6iqX9kNJto,359039,361520,uh they call it the hello scale because
P6iqX9kNJto,361520,363199,it says hello every time you turn on
P6iqX9kNJto,363199,365360,which is kind of a little funny thing to
P6iqX9kNJto,365360,367360,uh to add in but yeah if you're in the
P6iqX9kNJto,367360,368960,market for a new coffee scale for
P6iqX9kNJto,368960,371120,pour-overs or just any sort of kitchen
P6iqX9kNJto,371120,372960,scale you know it's really convenient if
P6iqX9kNJto,372960,374560,you're trying to diet and having to
P6iqX9kNJto,374560,376479,weigh your food or things like that i'm
P6iqX9kNJto,376479,378319,a big advocate for using scales for
P6iqX9kNJto,378319,381039,baking as well as my coffee use so i
P6iqX9kNJto,381039,381919,really
P6iqX9kNJto,381919,383840,have been so impressed with this for how
P6iqX9kNJto,383840,385919,inexpensive it was and can't recommend
P6iqX9kNJto,385919,388000,it enough while we're very conveniently
P6iqX9kNJto,388000,390000,on the topic of coffee i want to thank
P6iqX9kNJto,390000,392400,the sponsor of today's video and that is
P6iqX9kNJto,392400,395520,third wave water third wave water is a
P6iqX9kNJto,395520,397440,mineral blend designed to make the
P6iqX9kNJto,397440,399680,perfect water for brewing coffee in the
P6iqX9kNJto,399680,401199,pursuit of making the perfect cup of
P6iqX9kNJto,401199,403360,coffee at home so many people forget
P6iqX9kNJto,403360,405280,about the water you get a really great
P6iqX9kNJto,405280,407520,pour over system you get a nice digital
P6iqX9kNJto,407520,409120,scale so you can measure everything out
P6iqX9kNJto,409120,411280,perfectly you get a great bur grinder
P6iqX9kNJto,411280,413520,you get great single origin coffee beans
P6iqX9kNJto,413520,416080,from a local roaster all of these things
P6iqX9kNJto,416080,417759,and you still can't compete with your
P6iqX9kNJto,417759,420319,local coffee shop and i think more often
P6iqX9kNJto,420319,422400,than not the main reason for that is the
P6iqX9kNJto,422400,424720,quality of your water third wave water
P6iqX9kNJto,424720,427680,aims and succeeds to fix that i've been
P6iqX9kNJto,427680,429520,using it for a few months now and have
P6iqX9kNJto,429520,431280,been so impressed i mentioned it last
P6iqX9kNJto,431280,433680,time i worked with them as a sponsor is
P6iqX9kNJto,433680,435680,the biggest jump in quality for my
P6iqX9kNJto,435680,439039,coffee at home in so many years and i'm
P6iqX9kNJto,439039,441039,so impressed with how big of a
P6iqX9kNJto,441039,443039,difference it makes in my experience it
P6iqX9kNJto,443039,444560,brought out a lot of the sweetness and
P6iqX9kNJto,444560,446800,acidity of my coffee beans and really
P6iqX9kNJto,446800,449039,got rid of a lot of those unpleasant
P6iqX9kNJto,449039,450880,bitter notes i mainly use the classic
P6iqX9kNJto,450880,452400,profile because i'm usually more of a
P6iqX9kNJto,452400,454000,light to medium roast person but they
P6iqX9kNJto,454000,456400,also make a dark roast profile in an
P6iqX9kNJto,456400,458800,espresso roast profile so they cover a
P6iqX9kNJto,458800,461039,pretty big range of whatever kind of
P6iqX9kNJto,461039,462880,coffee that you drink you get a box with
P6iqX9kNJto,462880,464560,these little packets inside you dump
P6iqX9kNJto,464560,467120,this into a gallon of distilled water
P6iqX9kNJto,467120,469680,shake and then it is ready to go i
P6iqX9kNJto,469680,471759,actually have a coupon code as well use
P6iqX9kNJto,471759,474160,code joshfan for 10 off if you're
P6iqX9kNJto,474160,475919,interested in picking some up i'll be
P6iqX9kNJto,475919,477120,sure to have some links in the
P6iqX9kNJto,477120,479280,description huge thanks to third wave
P6iqX9kNJto,479280,481199,water for sponsoring this week's video
P6iqX9kNJto,481199,482960,next up i have an item for travel and
P6iqX9kNJto,482960,485680,that's the e-tec city luggage scale this
P6iqX9kNJto,485680,487680,is just another kind of no-name luggage
P6iqX9kNJto,487680,490080,scale i got from amazon it's 12 right
P6iqX9kNJto,490080,491919,now but i wanted to bring it up because
P6iqX9kNJto,491919,493120,sometimes when you're looking through
P6iqX9kNJto,493120,494479,all of that cheap stuff you don't know
P6iqX9kNJto,494479,495759,what's going to be a dud or what's going
P6iqX9kNJto,495759,497919,to be great in my experience this thing
P6iqX9kNJto,497919,499840,has performed perfectly it's really
P6iqX9kNJto,499840,501440,great to be able to weigh your luggage
P6iqX9kNJto,501440,503360,if you live somewhere with really tight
P6iqX9kNJto,503360,505919,luggage restrictions on the weight for
P6iqX9kNJto,505919,508240,me i use it even more so for my
P6iqX9kNJto,508240,510000,wilderness backpacking i like to weigh
P6iqX9kNJto,510000,512000,my pack before i go out on trips and
P6iqX9kNJto,512000,514000,kind of keep a log of the weight of my
P6iqX9kNJto,514000,516000,bag over time with different trips and
P6iqX9kNJto,516000,518159,scenarios i'm a big fan of collecting
P6iqX9kNJto,518159,520320,all that data for wilderness backpacking
P6iqX9kNJto,520320,522159,but especially for travel use i think
P6iqX9kNJto,522159,524399,this becomes even more important and
P6iqX9kNJto,524399,527040,essential to avoid paying over fees for
P6iqX9kNJto,527040,528560,having too heavy of a bag or if you're
P6iqX9kNJto,528560,529920,getting the airport and you have to
P6iqX9kNJto,529920,532080,check your carry-on bag because it's too
P6iqX9kNJto,532080,533760,heavy or something it's just nice to be
P6iqX9kNJto,533760,535120,able to have all of the rules and
P6iqX9kNJto,535120,537600,regulations in mind while you're packing
P6iqX9kNJto,537600,538959,and you can kind of make sure there's
P6iqX9kNJto,538959,541200,going to be no hiccups or interruptions
P6iqX9kNJto,541200,542800,while you're traveling
P6iqX9kNJto,542800,544560,so yeah 12 bucks this thing has worked
P6iqX9kNJto,544560,546800,really well i can't speak to any of the
P6iqX9kNJto,546800,548640,other options but definitely no need to
P6iqX9kNJto,548640,551519,spend any more than this budget one here
P6iqX9kNJto,551519,553760,got an old time favorite for me i'm sure
P6iqX9kNJto,553760,554880,if you've been around the channel you've
P6iqX9kNJto,554880,556640,heard me talk about it before but this
P6iqX9kNJto,556640,560480,is the nitecore nb 10000 power bank it's
P6iqX9kNJto,560480,563200,a 10 000 milliamp hour power bank and it
P6iqX9kNJto,563200,565920,is the smallest and lightest one on the
P6iqX9kNJto,565920,568240,market for this capacity i believe
P6iqX9kNJto,568240,569920,that's still the case be sure to correct
P6iqX9kNJto,569920,572240,me in the comments if i'm wrong but this
P6iqX9kNJto,572240,575120,thing is super tiny and compact compared
P6iqX9kNJto,575120,577519,to any other power bank i've used and
P6iqX9kNJto,577519,581440,it's only 5.3 ounces so around 150 grams
P6iqX9kNJto,581440,583440,for the metric folks out there i have a
P6iqX9kNJto,583440,585120,few other batteries that i really like
P6iqX9kNJto,585120,587360,like the banks magsafe battery but
P6iqX9kNJto,587360,589440,definitely if i had to pick one or just
P6iqX9kNJto,589440,591440,have one that's the most lightweight and
P6iqX9kNJto,591440,594000,versatile option i use this for outdoor
P6iqX9kNJto,594000,595839,backpacking as well where weight matters
P6iqX9kNJto,595839,598160,way more than normal travel so yeah if i
P6iqX9kNJto,598160,599680,had to pick one it would definitely be
P6iqX9kNJto,599680,602079,this one you have a usb c port a usb a
P6iqX9kNJto,602079,604480,port it does fast charging it's the
P6iqX9kNJto,604480,606560,lightest weight one on the market you're
P6iqX9kNJto,606560,608079,gonna pay a little bit of a premium for
P6iqX9kNJto,608079,610000,it but in my opinion it's worth it if
P6iqX9kNJto,610000,611279,you're really trying to shed those
P6iqX9kNJto,611279,613760,ounces or grams gonna throw a bit of a
P6iqX9kNJto,613760,616000,curveball into this one but i have a
P6iqX9kNJto,616000,617839,midi keyboard that i've recently been
P6iqX9kNJto,617839,620640,using and liking this is the akai mbk
P6iqX9kNJto,620640,622720,mini mark iii if you're new to the
P6iqX9kNJto,622720,625200,channel you might not know i spent all
P6iqX9kNJto,625200,627760,of my years in high school and college
P6iqX9kNJto,627760,630480,and after college in different bands i
P6iqX9kNJto,630480,632320,got to tour around the country for a few
P6iqX9kNJto,632320,634240,years which was really great
P6iqX9kNJto,634240,637120,music was the biggest thing in my life
P6iqX9kNJto,637120,641120,for my entire childhood and my early 20s
P6iqX9kNJto,641120,642560,moving out to portland working on
P6iqX9kNJto,642560,644560,youtube doing stuff you know i have kind
P6iqX9kNJto,644560,648560,of let music slide away and i've been
P6iqX9kNJto,648560,650160,looking to bring that back a bit and
P6iqX9kNJto,650160,651839,i've been wanting to get a mini keyboard
P6iqX9kNJto,651839,653920,this mini keyboard specifically for a
P6iqX9kNJto,653920,655680,few years so i can start getting back
P6iqX9kNJto,655680,658240,into making music again uh picked this
P6iqX9kNJto,658240,660079,up about a month ago and have just been
P6iqX9kNJto,660079,662720,having a blast this retails for 120
P6iqX9kNJto,662720,664480,bucks so it's a little bit over our
P6iqX9kNJto,664480,666320,hundred dollar limit but i did look you
P6iqX9kNJto,666320,668640,know you can get a like new used version
P6iqX9kNJto,668640,670160,for 98
P6iqX9kNJto,670160,672399,and then you can also get the mark 1 or
P6iqX9kNJto,672399,674320,mark 2 for a lot less expensive and i
P6iqX9kNJto,674320,676720,know those are very well reviewed as
P6iqX9kNJto,676720,677839,well
P6iqX9kNJto,677839,679519,but it is just great if you have any
P6iqX9kNJto,679519,681519,interest in music production this is an
P6iqX9kNJto,681519,683200,excellent entry there are definitely
P6iqX9kNJto,683200,685600,some compromises in a budget midi
P6iqX9kNJto,685600,686959,keyboard compared to some really
P6iqX9kNJto,686959,688800,high-end ones you know mainly in the
P6iqX9kNJto,688800,691040,feel and weight of the keys but
P6iqX9kNJto,691040,693120,considering this is you know a small
P6iqX9kNJto,693120,695040,fraction of the price of some of the
P6iqX9kNJto,695040,697120,really high-end ones it has performed
P6iqX9kNJto,697120,699839,admirably and has just been a ton of fun
P6iqX9kNJto,699839,702160,to get back into music and you know you
P6iqX9kNJto,702160,704720,have a drum pad you have a keyboard
P6iqX9kNJto,704720,706880,it's excellent it's had everything i
P6iqX9kNJto,706880,709680,need to get started into making music on
P6iqX9kNJto,709680,711519,the computer i've always been kind of a
P6iqX9kNJto,711519,713519,jack of all trades master of none
P6iqX9kNJto,713519,715440,musician i can play a lot of stuff but i
P6iqX9kNJto,715440,717200,can't play any of it really well so it's
P6iqX9kNJto,717200,718880,been fun learning and messing around
P6iqX9kNJto,718880,721360,with this and just getting to create a
P6iqX9kNJto,721360,723760,lot more using a computer compared to a
P6iqX9kNJto,723760,726000,more traditional instrument so if you're
P6iqX9kNJto,726000,727519,into music production or have been
P6iqX9kNJto,727519,730079,thinking about it the the apk mini mark
P6iqX9kNJto,730079,733200,iii has been excellent especially for a
P6iqX9kNJto,733200,735360,budget midi keyboard i can't recommend
P6iqX9kNJto,735360,737200,it enough kind of related to music
P6iqX9kNJto,737200,739200,production the next item on the list are
P6iqX9kNJto,739200,742639,the presonus aeris 3.5 inch studio
P6iqX9kNJto,742639,745600,speakers they're on my desk
P6iqX9kNJto,745600,748000,if i can point right there i bought
P6iqX9kNJto,748000,750399,these last year when i redid my studio
P6iqX9kNJto,750399,753120,and studio speakers can get so so
P6iqX9kNJto,753120,755200,expensive and i was on definitely a bit
P6iqX9kNJto,755200,757200,of a budget i picked these up for a
P6iqX9kNJto,757200,759040,hundred bucks and i have been thoroughly
P6iqX9kNJto,759040,761040,impressed with them the sound profile
P6iqX9kNJto,761040,763040,isn't as flat as i would like to do
P6iqX9kNJto,763040,765040,really audio critical work i usually
P6iqX9kNJto,765040,767519,still turn to my headphones and amp when
P6iqX9kNJto,767519,769680,i'm doing something like that but for
P6iqX9kNJto,769680,771920,general consumption and general video
P6iqX9kNJto,771920,774000,editing where i'm not mixing the sound
P6iqX9kNJto,774000,776480,itself they have been really great i
P6iqX9kNJto,776480,779120,also use them for playing xbox and
P6iqX9kNJto,779120,781040,having really great speakers for video
P6iqX9kNJto,781040,783839,games is awesome as well all around for
P6iqX9kNJto,783839,785920,a hundred bucks for a pair of speakers
P6iqX9kNJto,785920,787519,of that quality i've just been really
P6iqX9kNJto,787519,789760,impressed and really happy with the
P6iqX9kNJto,789760,791600,investment that's gonna wrap it up for
P6iqX9kNJto,791600,793760,the list though definitely an eclectic
P6iqX9kNJto,793760,796320,hodgepodge sort of list of tech items i
P6iqX9kNJto,796320,798160,hope you appreciated it though i used to

P6iqX9kNJto,799760,801440,commuted to and from work with all the
P6iqX9kNJto,801440,803839,tech i use and now that i work from home
P6iqX9kNJto,803839,805440,i don't really bring my tech around that
