SfHtImc6AFQ,109680,111840,shocking lack of policy around getting
SfHtImc6AFQ,111840,114079,better insulation into homes and its
SfHtImc6AFQ,114079,116560,latest report said if previous policies
SfHtImc6AFQ,116560,119040,on insulation hadn't been scrapped
SfHtImc6AFQ,119040,121119,households would be saving 40 pounds a
SfHtImc6AFQ,121119,123119,year on bills it recommended the

SfHtImc6AFQ,175920,178400,las vegas shows he told us they used a
SfHtImc6AFQ,178400,181200,mix of real life shots and cgi to create
SfHtImc6AFQ,181200,183599,the final look so they'll build a stage
SfHtImc6AFQ,183599,185519,for where elvis is performing and then
SfHtImc6AFQ,185519,188560,they'll put people close to the stage
SfHtImc6AFQ,188560,190959,and then they'll have nobody in the kind
SfHtImc6AFQ,190959,193200,of blue screen area and then we add the
SfHtImc6AFQ,193200,195120,whole cg environment and then all the
SfHtImc6AFQ,195120,197760,crowds in that area and he said a lot of

SfHtImc6AFQ,211599,213440,during all the various concerts that he
SfHtImc6AFQ,213440,215440,had so we had to do all that research
SfHtImc6AFQ,215440,217760,and constantly ask ourselves okay if

SfHtImc6AFQ,338080,340560,cause of human infections the study
SfHtImc6AFQ,340560,342560,found it maintained its antibiotic
SfHtImc6AFQ,342560,344880,resistance over decades in pigs and
SfHtImc6AFQ,344880,347360,other livestock making it much harder to
SfHtImc6AFQ,347360,349919,treat than other bacterial infections
SfHtImc6AFQ,349919,351440,the world health organization now
SfHtImc6AFQ,351440,353600,considers it one of the world's greatest
