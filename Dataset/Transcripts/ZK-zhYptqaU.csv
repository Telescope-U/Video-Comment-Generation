ZK-zhYptqaU,2836,5046,The luxury industry is reinventing
ZK-zhYptqaU,5046,6881,the way it connects with customers
ZK-zhYptqaU,6881,10051,in a landscape forever altered by the pandemic.
ZK-zhYptqaU,12595,13930,"So, here we are in Paris,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,13930,16599,and one of the things I absolutely wanted to do
ZK-zhYptqaU,16599,19227,was to understand how all of the time that people have spent
ZK-zhYptqaU,19227,22605,"at home has changed the way they shop in stores,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,22605,25275,and there's kind of no better place to do that
ZK-zhYptqaU,25275,27736,than here at La Samaritaine.
ZK-zhYptqaU,29362,31156,"Hello! Hello, Imran."
ZK-zhYptqaU,31156,32699,"So nice to meet you, are we doing this?"
ZK-zhYptqaU,32699,34451,"Welcome, welcome here,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,34451,36619,"you know, to Samaritaine. Oh, it's amazing."
ZK-zhYptqaU,36619,38163,"At the time of its reopening,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,38163,41165,"following a $1 billion restoration,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,41166,43960,"Parisians are keen to take a look around,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,43960,47087,but luxury tourists are nowhere to be found.
ZK-zhYptqaU,48006,52052,"So, for now, the all-important Chinese luxury customers"
ZK-zhYptqaU,52052,54136,are getting used to shopping at home.
ZK-zhYptqaU,54137,57265,Chinese consumers have now come around
ZK-zhYptqaU,57265,59975,to accepting the prices in China.
ZK-zhYptqaU,59976,64230,That psychological barrier is already overcome.
ZK-zhYptqaU,65565,68109,Top luxury executives are still bullish
ZK-zhYptqaU,68109,71571,because this is an industry with built-in growth.
ZK-zhYptqaU,71571,74115,The share of the young generations
ZK-zhYptqaU,74115,75825,"in the total business is increasing,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,75825,78077,"so there is a very strong and, I think,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,78078,80830,structural rebalancing between people
ZK-zhYptqaU,80830,82791,from 40 years old and above
ZK-zhYptqaU,82791,85418,and people from 40 years and below.
ZK-zhYptqaU,85418,87754,And this is driving exceptional expansion
ZK-zhYptqaU,87754,89631,"for the biggest luxury brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,89631,94510,whose businesses have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
ZK-zhYptqaU,94511,97764,But how are luxury executives preparing themselves
ZK-zhYptqaU,97764,99557,as the world reopens?
ZK-zhYptqaU,99557,101559,"We have more and more customers,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,101559,103853,so our customers are going everywhere.
ZK-zhYptqaU,105396,108066,"Past year, double digits in every single country,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,108983,110902,so we have more and more customers.
ZK-zhYptqaU,112362,115990,What we wear says a lot about who we are.
ZK-zhYptqaU,115990,117367,"I'm Imran Amed,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,117367,119451,and this is The Business of Fashion Show.
ZK-zhYptqaU,121287,124040,I'm on a journey to see how fashion is recalibrating
ZK-zhYptqaU,124040,128169,amid the pandemic to balance profit with purpose.
ZK-zhYptqaU,128169,131214,"Join me to discover how fashion shapes business,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,131214,133383,"culture, and identity,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,133383,136302,and to meet the people forging fashion's future.
ZK-zhYptqaU,145436,149107,"This is La Samaritaine, where the boast used to be,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,149107,151693,"""On trouve tout à la Samaritaine,"""
ZK-zhYptqaU,151693,154028,the place where you can find everything.
ZK-zhYptqaU,161911,165957,"The iconic Parisian department store was founded in 1870,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,165957,169919,but closed in 2005 due to health and safety concerns
ZK-zhYptqaU,169919,172547,"only four years after LVMH,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,172547,174382,"the world's largest luxury group,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,174382,176009,bought a controlling stake.
ZK-zhYptqaU,178887,182265,LVMH spent years refurbishing its Art Nouveau
ZK-zhYptqaU,182265,184517,"and Art Deco architecture,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,184517,187228,"but delays plagued the construction,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,187228,191649,"and when La Samaritaine was finally ready in April, 2020,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,191649,193693,the pandemic stopped everything.
ZK-zhYptqaU,194694,197906,"Now, La Samaritaine has finally reopened,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,197906,199866,and I am excited to explore.
ZK-zhYptqaU,202327,203786,Shall we take a look around quickly?
ZK-zhYptqaU,203786,205330,"Yes, absolutely. All right, amazing."
ZK-zhYptqaU,205330,207957,"My tour guide is Eleonore De Boysson,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,207957,211920,"President for Europe, the Middle East and Africa of DFS,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,211920,214505,the luxury travel retailer.
ZK-zhYptqaU,214505,216716,It was her mission to bring new life back
ZK-zhYptqaU,216716,218885,to this old Parisian landmark.
ZK-zhYptqaU,218885,221346,I want to learn how her plans have changed.
ZK-zhYptqaU,221346,222764,How do you think this is different?
ZK-zhYptqaU,222764,225975,"You know, Paris has no shortage of department stores, right?"
ZK-zhYptqaU,225975,228519,"In the LVMH group, you have Le Bon Marché."
ZK-zhYptqaU,228519,230271,"There's also Printemps,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,230271,231898,"there's Galeries Lafayette. Yeah, yeah."
ZK-zhYptqaU,231898,233858,"When you have so much competition,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,233858,236069,how do you create something different?
ZK-zhYptqaU,236069,237362,"The first thing is, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,237362,239781,"we really created a living place,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,239781,241616,"not just a place for shopping,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,241616,245536,"and it's a combination, if you want, of different things."
ZK-zhYptqaU,245536,248414,"I mean, first you have, you know, all they offer,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,248414,251251,"which is not only the big international brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,251251,255421,"but this, you know, multiplicity of smaller brands"
ZK-zhYptqaU,255421,257423,that are really surprises for Parisians
ZK-zhYptqaU,257423,259008,"or for tourists, and so on."
ZK-zhYptqaU,261177,263304,I asked Eleonore how she was planning
ZK-zhYptqaU,263304,265806,"for the current situation, where the tourists,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,265807,269102,expected to drive 50% of foot traffic
ZK-zhYptqaU,269102,273147,"and an even higher percentage of spend, are missing."
ZK-zhYptqaU,273147,276234,I really believe that if we do something
ZK-zhYptqaU,276234,278611,"which is suited for the Parisians,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,278611,281738,if they really like the store and come back often
ZK-zhYptqaU,281739,283533,"because we give them reasons to come back,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,283533,285660,"because the store is changing, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,285660,288955,"all the time and will evolve permanently,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,288955,290957,I believe that's where tourists want to go
ZK-zhYptqaU,290957,293501,because they want to go in an authentic place
ZK-zhYptqaU,293501,294877,when they come back.
ZK-zhYptqaU,294877,297630,"You know, with all of that spending not happening here,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,297630,301259,"you know, how do you adapt to this situation,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,301259,303261,"because obviously you had the budgets and plans for, like,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,303261,305345,"all these Chinese tourists. Obviously, I mean,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,305346,308433,"obviously, you know, it will be a couple of years,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,308433,310643,"you know, before the tourists come back."
ZK-zhYptqaU,310643,314731,"I mean, maybe in a year, a year and a half, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,314731,317692,"a little bit more difficult, but it doesn't really matter"
ZK-zhYptqaU,317692,321862,"because we are really thinking, you know, in the long-term."
ZK-zhYptqaU,321863,325867,"So, you know, whether we are here for decades."
ZK-zhYptqaU,334042,337503,"To understand how luxury fashion brands are adapting,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,337503,338880,we must first understand
ZK-zhYptqaU,338880,342050,how the luxury customer base is changing.
ZK-zhYptqaU,342050,344509,Who drives luxury spending now?
ZK-zhYptqaU,344510,348806,"The Chinese, to the tune of $130 billion a year."
ZK-zhYptqaU,351017,354729,That's more than 35% of the global total.
ZK-zhYptqaU,354729,357273,Who are the decision-makers of the future?
ZK-zhYptqaU,357273,361152,The under 25 global demographic known as Gen Z.
ZK-zhYptqaU,362111,366240,"Around the world and in real life, and certainly on TikTok,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,366240,367992,"Gen Z are hyper-connected,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,367992,370995,niche-influenced and socially informed.
ZK-zhYptqaU,370995,374665,Overlay these two groups and you get what China calls
ZK-zhYptqaU,374665,378753,its post-1995 and post-2000 generations.
ZK-zhYptqaU,378753,382340,"For luxury brands, that's a valuable Venn diagram."
ZK-zhYptqaU,384467,388513,"Luxury sales in China grew by 45% in 2020,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,388513,391516,where the under 25s spent five times more
ZK-zhYptqaU,391516,393309,than their peers in the US.
ZK-zhYptqaU,393309,395186,When you take into account the influence
ZK-zhYptqaU,395186,397397,"they have over family spending,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,397397,399232,that figure rises further.
ZK-zhYptqaU,400316,404529,"40% of young, single Chinese living in Tier-1 cities"
ZK-zhYptqaU,404529,407323,call themselves the Moonlight Clan
ZK-zhYptqaU,407323,410785,because they tend to spend their entire monthly salary
ZK-zhYptqaU,410785,413538,"over a single lunar cycle,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,413538,415623,"but with international travel curtailed,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,415623,418835,reaching the Chinese on home turf is vital.
ZK-zhYptqaU,418835,421421,Mega brands are harmonizing global prices
ZK-zhYptqaU,421421,424382,and going all out to spark engagement.
ZK-zhYptqaU,425383,429595,"Now, competition comes from chic homegrown labels."
ZK-zhYptqaU,429595,433224,"After three decades of aspiration for European brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,433224,436102,more than a quarter say they prefer made in China
ZK-zhYptqaU,436102,437770,to made in France.
ZK-zhYptqaU,437770,440857,"To win Gen Z's hearts and wallets,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,440857,444068,brands must wear their values on their sleeves.
ZK-zhYptqaU,450616,453202,To better understand the impact of the pandemic
ZK-zhYptqaU,453202,455371,"on luxury customers in China,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,455371,458207,I caught up with one of the most influential figures
ZK-zhYptqaU,458207,460501,in the global fashion industry.
ZK-zhYptqaU,460501,462920,"For the first time in more than a decade,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,462920,466132,"Angelica Cheung is missing Haute Couture Week in Paris,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,466132,469759,"which happens twice a year, in January and July."
ZK-zhYptqaU,469760,471554,"Hi, Angelica. Hi, Imran."
ZK-zhYptqaU,471554,473763,Good to see you again. I know.
ZK-zhYptqaU,473764,475183,We've managed to keep in touch
ZK-zhYptqaU,475183,476976,"quite a lot over the last 12 months,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,476976,480188,but only virtually because you've been in China
ZK-zhYptqaU,480188,481981,"the whole time. Well, yes,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,481981,484942,"you know, it's unbelievable."
ZK-zhYptqaU,484942,487319,The former editor-in-chief of Vogue China
ZK-zhYptqaU,487320,489280,also has a new job.
ZK-zhYptqaU,489280,490948,"In February, 2021,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,490948,492909,she announced that she was crossing over
ZK-zhYptqaU,492909,494869,to join the venture capitalists.
ZK-zhYptqaU,495786,498539,Sequoia Capital China recently invested
ZK-zhYptqaU,498539,500541,"in Montreal-based SSENSE,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,500541,503711,a luxury e-commerce company targeted at Gen Z
ZK-zhYptqaU,503711,506672,and now valued at $4.1 billion.
ZK-zhYptqaU,508799,510551,Angelica was named to the board
ZK-zhYptqaU,510551,513387,to advise on engaging with the key demographic
ZK-zhYptqaU,513387,516599,"driving luxury growth, Chinese youth."
ZK-zhYptqaU,517599,521102,"At some point, Angelica, China will open its borders"
ZK-zhYptqaU,521103,523231,and people will be able to travel again.
ZK-zhYptqaU,523231,527527,What behaviors of this Chinese luxury customer
ZK-zhYptqaU,527527,529402,are going to stick?
ZK-zhYptqaU,529403,531989,I think that what's changed
ZK-zhYptqaU,531989,536994,"about Chinese consumers is that they are so much online now,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,537370,540873,"so digital, so much into e-commerce, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,540873,543376,"getting everything, and also, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,543376,546878,don't forget that Chinese consumers have now
ZK-zhYptqaU,546879,549966,come around to accepting
ZK-zhYptqaU,549966,551467,the prices in China.
ZK-zhYptqaU,551467,553511,That psychological barrier
ZK-zhYptqaU,554512,556472,is already overcome.
ZK-zhYptqaU,556472,560518,What do you think are the biggest changes in the way
ZK-zhYptqaU,560518,563896,"the Chinese customers' mindset and, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,563896,566440,attitude is towards this industry?
ZK-zhYptqaU,566440,569110,"Like, you said they've become more sophisticated."
ZK-zhYptqaU,569110,571028,"Well, I think, for one,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,571028,575700,the obvious change is the shift from logo
ZK-zhYptqaU,575700,580121,"to no logo, and now the new generation, logo again,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,580121,582248,"but in a very different way, you know."
ZK-zhYptqaU,582248,585251,"Earlier, 15 years ago,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,585251,589337,the logo was really for very few people
ZK-zhYptqaU,589338,593050,who became more successful or affluent.
ZK-zhYptqaU,593050,596971,They were really symbols of status at that time.
ZK-zhYptqaU,596971,599223,"Yeah. And then fast forward,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,599223,602393,"the new logo period is really the Gen Z,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,602393,603853,the Millennials generation.
ZK-zhYptqaU,614864,617366,"The interlocking Cs of Chanel,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,617366,620369,one of the most recognizable brands in the world
ZK-zhYptqaU,620369,624915,which generates more than $10 billion in annual revenue.
ZK-zhYptqaU,624915,627709,Chanel is owned by the elusive Wertheimer family
ZK-zhYptqaU,627710,629629,that avoids press attention.
ZK-zhYptqaU,629629,632131,"Luckily, they have an affable president,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,632131,634133,"in the form of Bruno Pavlovsky,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,634133,636719,who runs the global fashion business.
ZK-zhYptqaU,636719,638262,"Under his leadership,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,638262,641557,Chanel is holding fast to physical boutiques
ZK-zhYptqaU,641557,643851,and live fashion shows as a way
ZK-zhYptqaU,643851,646020,of connecting with customers.
ZK-zhYptqaU,646020,647605,I wanted to learn why.
ZK-zhYptqaU,649315,651609,"At Chanel, we have our way of doing it,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,651609,653861,and it's not only because it's a crisis.
ZK-zhYptqaU,653861,657239,"I think that the show, the fashion show,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,657239,659116,is the beginning of the storytelling.
ZK-zhYptqaU,660159,664914,We are engaging a lot of customers through these shows.
ZK-zhYptqaU,664914,667249,We have thousands and thousands of people
ZK-zhYptqaU,668417,670211,who are engaging with the brand
ZK-zhYptqaU,670211,673464,through this new storytelling.
ZK-zhYptqaU,673464,676550,"It's too far, where fashion is available in the boutiques."
ZK-zhYptqaU,676550,679595,"That's a way to connect with the creative part,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,679595,681722,"with Virginie [Viard], to understand the next"
ZK-zhYptqaU,681722,682972,step of the brand.
ZK-zhYptqaU,682973,687978,"Also, a way to create a famous dream through our collection,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,687978,691399,"and the best way to communicate,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,691399,693776,"to engage, with these fashion shows."
ZK-zhYptqaU,699782,702034,The late Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel shows
ZK-zhYptqaU,702034,705204,grew to a scale unseen before in fashion.
ZK-zhYptqaU,707123,710626,"Ambitious, innovative, and playful."
ZK-zhYptqaU,711711,714588,"From the 1950s through to today,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,714588,717675,the signature Boucle Jacket is ever-present
ZK-zhYptqaU,717675,719677,and re-imagined for the moment.
ZK-zhYptqaU,720845,724974,"Chanel's shows, once reserved for industry insiders,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,724974,726475,are increasingly designed
ZK-zhYptqaU,726475,729019,to engage customers following online.
ZK-zhYptqaU,730688,734899,"In 2020, a new creative director, Virginie Viard,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,734900,737236,"continued to stage fashion shows,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,737236,741115,even if it was not possible to have a physical audience.
ZK-zhYptqaU,741115,743701,Chanel is also sticking to its guns
ZK-zhYptqaU,743701,746495,when it comes to physical retail.
ZK-zhYptqaU,746495,749248,You and I have talked in the past a lot
ZK-zhYptqaU,749248,752959,"about Chanel's position, which is, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,752960,756213,we don't sell clothing or ready-to-wear
ZK-zhYptqaU,756213,758174,or handbags on the internet.
ZK-zhYptqaU,759049,761719,"Did, at any moment during the pandemic,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,761719,764513,you regret that decision because other brands
ZK-zhYptqaU,764513,767183,saw a massive spike in sales?
ZK-zhYptqaU,767183,770602,"No, because when we know customers"
ZK-zhYptqaU,770603,775608,"and when she needed something special, we can organize that,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,776901,778235,but it's not through
ZK-zhYptqaU,779820,784784,"chanel.com or e-commerce, it's through the relationship,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,785284,786994,"and it's working, you know?"
ZK-zhYptqaU,786994,788829,"Perhaps if it was not working,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,789830,791707,"we'll have asked the question ourself,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,791707,794209,is that right way of doing things?
ZK-zhYptqaU,794210,796003,"But we don't try to sell more handbags,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,796003,799131,we don't try to sell more Chanel.
ZK-zhYptqaU,799131,803260,It's about this new experience that we try to offer
ZK-zhYptqaU,803260,806806,"to the customers, and we want them to see and touch."
ZK-zhYptqaU,807723,811060,"I know that, quite often, they know exactly what they want,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,811060,813646,"but you know, what we noticed is that when they come"
ZK-zhYptqaU,813646,815731,"to the boutique and think, I want that,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,816774,819151,they quite often go out with something else.
ZK-zhYptqaU,819151,822196,"So, the fact, to be able to come in the boutique,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,822196,823781,"to discover the collection,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,823781,828786,to see perhaps more than what you imagined is always good.
ZK-zhYptqaU,828828,830746,"So, Chanel is about your dream,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,830746,832706,and we like to keep the surprise.
ZK-zhYptqaU,833582,835376,Do you think you might be missing out
ZK-zhYptqaU,835376,836919,on some new customers?
ZK-zhYptqaU,837795,842299,"Maybe, but we have more and more customers."
ZK-zhYptqaU,842299,844510,"So, I understand the point,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,844510,847847,is that our customers are going everywhere.
ZK-zhYptqaU,849098,852434,"Past year, double digits in every single country."
ZK-zhYptqaU,852434,855729,"So, I think that what you mention is rare."
ZK-zhYptqaU,855729,858274,"It's a risk, obviously,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,858274,860651,"but at the same time,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,860651,863070,we are seen more and more successful.
ZK-zhYptqaU,863070,863946,"Thank you, Bruno. Thank you."
ZK-zhYptqaU,863946,865321,It was very nice to talk to you.
ZK-zhYptqaU,865322,866907,Thanks. All right.
ZK-zhYptqaU,868158,872204,"So, it's not that Chanel is rejecting digital innovation."
ZK-zhYptqaU,872204,876125,It's just choosing how and where to embrace it.
ZK-zhYptqaU,876125,879795,"For another perspective, I head across town to le septième,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,879795,882339,Paris' 7th arrondissement.
ZK-zhYptqaU,882339,884466,The global headquarters of Kering
ZK-zhYptqaU,884466,888220,"are not what you might expect, housed in a former hospital"
ZK-zhYptqaU,888220,892016,constructed beginning in 1692.
ZK-zhYptqaU,892016,895519,"So, we are at the global headquarters of Kering,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,895519,899105,which is the luxury group that owns a number
ZK-zhYptqaU,899106,901901,"of internationally renowned fashion brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,901901,904987,"including Gucci, Saint Laurent,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,904987,908032,"Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,908032,911701,"Bottega Veneta, and a number of other big luxury brands."
ZK-zhYptqaU,911702,913996,"François-Henri Pinault leads Kering,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,913996,916123,"the world's second largest luxury group,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,916123,918500,which made more than $17 billion
ZK-zhYptqaU,918500,920878,in annual sales before the pandemic.
ZK-zhYptqaU,922796,924882,"The jewel in the Kering crown is Gucci,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,924882,928260,which generates more than 80% of operating income.
ZK-zhYptqaU,929345,931347,"Amid the global health crisis,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,931347,936352,revenues at Kering dropped 17.5% in 2020.
ZK-zhYptqaU,936352,939938,"12 months later, customers in Asia and the US"
ZK-zhYptqaU,939939,942274,are driving a sharp recovery.
ZK-zhYptqaU,942274,944944,"During the first half of 2021,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,944944,949573,e-commerce revenue at Kering was up 78.5%.
ZK-zhYptqaU,949573,951909,The behaviors luxury customers learned
ZK-zhYptqaU,951909,953869,during the pandemic are sticking.
ZK-zhYptqaU,959249,963337,I wanted to start with the last 16 months.
ZK-zhYptqaU,963337,966464,It feels like the fashion world is kind of snapping back
ZK-zhYptqaU,966465,968926,"to its old ways of operating, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,968926,971095,that there's a reawakening happening.
ZK-zhYptqaU,971095,972553,"Everyone's, you know, people are back"
ZK-zhYptqaU,972554,973514,from all over the world.
ZK-zhYptqaU,973514,976100,"Is this over? No, it's not."
ZK-zhYptqaU,976100,978310,"No, it's not, we need to be very cautious"
ZK-zhYptqaU,978310,982773,"because a year ago, we thought it was over and it came back."
ZK-zhYptqaU,982773,984858,"So, we don't know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,984858,986151,and no one knows. Yeah.
ZK-zhYptqaU,986151,987736,I'm keen to understand
ZK-zhYptqaU,988821,991990,who you see as the luxury customer now.
ZK-zhYptqaU,991991,993575,How do you think about that customer?
ZK-zhYptqaU,993575,995119,How do you describe that customer?
ZK-zhYptqaU,995119,998789,What is structural in terms of the new world of luxury
ZK-zhYptqaU,998789,1002876,is that the share of the young generations
ZK-zhYptqaU,1002876,1004586,"in the total business is increasing,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1004586,1006880,"so there is a very strong and, I think,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1006880,1010259,structural rebalancing between people
ZK-zhYptqaU,1010259,1012219,from 40 years old and above
ZK-zhYptqaU,1012219,1014972,and people from 40 years and below.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1014972,1018100,It used to be three quarters of the older generation
ZK-zhYptqaU,1018100,1021269,and one quarter of the younger generation.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1021270,1024480,"It's more 50/50, and even 60/40,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1024480,1027860,"and I do really believe that they expect from brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1027860,1030069,"and particularly from luxury brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1030069,1033157,very different things than the previous generations
ZK-zhYptqaU,1033157,1036952,"in terms of commitment, in terms of sense of purpose."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1036952,1039496,"Now, it's not just about beautiful product,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1039496,1040747,it's much more than that.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1040748,1042624,They want to make sure that the way
ZK-zhYptqaU,1042624,1047463,"those products are conceived, built, are respectful."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1047463,1050215,How do you see that luxury customer
ZK-zhYptqaU,1050215,1053552,having been impacted by the pandemic?
ZK-zhYptqaU,1053552,1056847,"You know, the Chinese customer, for example,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1056847,1059808,"if you go around the stores here in Paris,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1059808,1062019,"at this time of year, normally,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1062019,1064354,the city would be packed with tourists.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1064354,1066148,"It shows us something very important,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1066148,1069943,is that this business of luxury is about human connection.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1070944,1073572,And even though the crisis has shown that you need
ZK-zhYptqaU,1073572,1076116,to be accessible because people want to continue
ZK-zhYptqaU,1076116,1077950,"to have the dialogue with you,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1077951,1081371,"even if it has to be done through websites,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1081371,1083122,"internet, at a distance,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1083123,1086752,it doesn't mean that this is satisfactory.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1086752,1089295,"It's better than not being in touch with your customers,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1089296,1091465,"so that's why it's working,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1091465,1095803,"but we still need to find ways of reconnecting with people,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1095803,1096929,even at a distance.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1096929,1098888,"Interestingly enough, last year,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1099973,1102101,"in '19, we were"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1102101,1104268,every agreement while doing e-commerce
ZK-zhYptqaU,1104269,1108816,"was around 6%, your direct e-commerce business,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1108816,1111110,"and then it doubled or it tripled in a year,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1112528,1114570,but what appeared
ZK-zhYptqaU,1114571,1117366,"is what we call distant sales from stores,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1117366,1120828,"which is a sales associate, human people,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1122162,1126750,"Talking at a distance with customers, being a video,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1126750,1128502,or it could be a chat.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1128502,1130503,"And this is why it's not obvious,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1130504,1132381,"but for me, it showed us that,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1132381,1134257,"how important is, and will be,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1134258,1136677,the human connection in this business.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1136677,1138011,Even though you are very strong
ZK-zhYptqaU,1138011,1141181,"and we are very strong online in all the brands,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1142224,1144101,we cannot leave it like this.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1144101,1148480,"How do we recreate this human bond, even online?"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1148480,1150731,"Thank you, Mr. Pinault. Thank you."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1152776,1154778,Kering has shown how technology
ZK-zhYptqaU,1154778,1158949,"can drive customer interactions and impressive sales growth,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1158949,1161617,"but by the time the tourists come back to Europe,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1161618,1164121,they'll be looking for something different.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1164121,1167708,Chinese luxury consumers have become more sophisticated.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1167708,1172671,"More and more, they are into seeking exclusive products,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1173589,1175674,"limited editions, you know,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1175674,1178467,things that they don't see on everybody.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1178468,1181722,"So, when they start to travel one day overseas,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1181722,1184057,"hopefully soon, we all hope,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1184057,1188312,"that I feel they expect to see different products,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1188312,1190564,"you know, when they go everywhere else."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1191857,1195110,"You know, why they go to the same brand shop,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1195110,1198280,"you know, in Paris, in Milan, in London,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1198280,1201325,"when they actually have everything here,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1201325,1205454,that's something that probably is going to happen.
ZK-zhYptqaU,1205454,1208624,"Angelica, thank you so much for connecting with me"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1208624,1211460,"all the way from Beijing. Yes, my pleasure."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1211460,1215214,"Yes, next time we chat, we'll do it face to face."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1217382,1221470,"For luxury, this is an era of reinvention."
ZK-zhYptqaU,1221470,1225974,"The pandemic may not be over, but it has already underscored"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1225974,1227976,to luxury executives the importance
ZK-zhYptqaU,1227976,1231355,"of creating human connections with their customers,"
ZK-zhYptqaU,1231355,1235025,and now they have more ways than ever to do so.
