_KuLPKPzmcY,80,3120,me literally a couple of days ago i'm
_KuLPKPzmcY,3120,5279,stuck on the same book for weeks because
_KuLPKPzmcY,5279,7680,my attention span deteriorated thanks to
_KuLPKPzmcY,7680,10480,that spawn of the devil app
_KuLPKPzmcY,10480,13280,welcome to my tic tac reaction video to
_KuLPKPzmcY,13280,14400,be fair though
_KuLPKPzmcY,14400,16320,i'm really having a hard time with this
_KuLPKPzmcY,16320,17440,app it's like a
_KuLPKPzmcY,17440,20240,true love-hate relationship because i
_KuLPKPzmcY,20240,22320,like the content like i appreciate the
_KuLPKPzmcY,22320,23760,content it makes me laugh
_KuLPKPzmcY,23760,25840,and i like creating the content but at
_KuLPKPzmcY,25840,26800,the same time
_KuLPKPzmcY,26800,29199,it's taking over my life and i'm not
_KuLPKPzmcY,29199,31279,even kidding if my phone stats are
_KuLPKPzmcY,31279,33280,correct i spent an average seven
_KuLPKPzmcY,33280,35360,hours on this damn nap like two weeks
_KuLPKPzmcY,35360,37280,ago before i deleted it again
_KuLPKPzmcY,37280,39520,why am i doing this video right after i
_KuLPKPzmcY,39520,41360,decided to break this addiction i
_KuLPKPzmcY,41360,44320,legit don't know anyway um today we're
_KuLPKPzmcY,44320,45440,going to
_KuLPKPzmcY,45440,48079,watch fashion history tick tocks a lot
_KuLPKPzmcY,48079,49600,of you guys are sending me
_KuLPKPzmcY,49600,51440,videos of people getting dressed in
_KuLPKPzmcY,51440,53039,historical eras or like trying
_KuLPKPzmcY,53039,54719,historical makeup and they're like
_KuLPKPzmcY,54719,56800,review honestly i feel like dissing
_KuLPKPzmcY,56800,58079,individual creators
_KuLPKPzmcY,58079,61039,for dressing inaccurately ain't it for
_KuLPKPzmcY,61039,61440,me
_KuLPKPzmcY,61440,63280,uh and there is also a power imbalance
_KuLPKPzmcY,63280,65119,like i have a bigger youtube channel
_KuLPKPzmcY,65119,66640,and lots of people watching it and
_KuLPKPzmcY,66640,68479,they're mostly just small creators
_KuLPKPzmcY,68479,70400,posting videos of themselves doing
_KuLPKPzmcY,70400,72960,fun things so i'm not going to do that
_KuLPKPzmcY,72960,74640,but we're going to focus on those
_KuLPKPzmcY,74640,77759,like educational or informational videos
_KuLPKPzmcY,77759,80799,and see if they deliver but before we
_KuLPKPzmcY,80799,81600,jump into it
_KuLPKPzmcY,81600,84080,just a quick reminder that it still is
_KuLPKPzmcY,84080,84799,not an
_KuLPKPzmcY,84799,87040,invitation for you guys to go and bash
_KuLPKPzmcY,87040,88799,the creators whose work i'll be
_KuLPKPzmcY,88799,90880,presenting and analyzing here in fact if
_KuLPKPzmcY,90880,92560,you want to give them a follow give them
_KuLPKPzmcY,92560,93119,a follow
_KuLPKPzmcY,93119,95439,if you just want to complain or moan
_KuLPKPzmcY,95439,97439,that they're not historically accurate
_KuLPKPzmcY,97439,99439,or that they're wrong maybe just let's
_KuLPKPzmcY,99439,100479,not do that let's
_KuLPKPzmcY,100479,102640,just stick to the video i cannot frame
_KuLPKPzmcY,102640,104000,myself properly because i keep
_KuLPKPzmcY,104000,106640,moving the background is ugly though but
_KuLPKPzmcY,106640,109119,so is the foreground
_KuLPKPzmcY,109119,112399,just kidding anyway hope skirts annoying
_KuLPKPzmcY,112399,112799,men
_KuLPKPzmcY,112799,116000,since 1846. you see back then just like
_KuLPKPzmcY,116000,118000,today men had this nasty habit of
_KuLPKPzmcY,118000,119360,putting their hands where they didn't
_KuLPKPzmcY,119360,120079,belong
_KuLPKPzmcY,120079,122079,and women got so fed up with it they
_KuLPKPzmcY,122079,123759,started wearing clothes so large that
_KuLPKPzmcY,123759,124240,the men
_KuLPKPzmcY,124240,127119,physically had to stay away isn't that
_KuLPKPzmcY,127119,128080,brilliant
_KuLPKPzmcY,128080,129759,not only that but because hoop skirts
_KuLPKPzmcY,129759,131520,were relatively cheap to make
_KuLPKPzmcY,131520,133360,for once women of different social
_KuLPKPzmcY,133360,134959,classes could all look
_KuLPKPzmcY,134959,137440,fabulous and not be picked out in public
_KuLPKPzmcY,137440,138959,as poor versus
_KuLPKPzmcY,138959,141120,rich and be treated differently because
_KuLPKPzmcY,141120,142400,of that and of course
_KuLPKPzmcY,142400,144239,because women didn't have to wear
_KuLPKPzmcY,144239,145760,massive layers
_KuLPKPzmcY,145760,147599,of skirts underneath to keep their
_KuLPKPzmcY,147599,148800,dresses all poofy
_KuLPKPzmcY,148800,151519,they could actually move for once so
_KuLPKPzmcY,151519,152080,yeah
_KuLPKPzmcY,152080,156239,hoop skirts an unexpected feminist icon
_KuLPKPzmcY,156239,158640,okay um i agree with the second half
_KuLPKPzmcY,158640,160879,like it was definitely something that
_KuLPKPzmcY,160879,163760,allowed poorer women to for once look
_KuLPKPzmcY,163760,165519,fashionable i'm pretty sure
_KuLPKPzmcY,165519,167360,if you were a victorian woman you would
_KuLPKPzmcY,167360,168879,still be able to tell
_KuLPKPzmcY,168879,171440,like who is poor and who is not poor
_KuLPKPzmcY,171440,173760,based on the outer garments because the
_KuLPKPzmcY,173760,175680,hoop skirt itself wasn't like the only
_KuLPKPzmcY,175680,177440,fashion item that you needed to own
_KuLPKPzmcY,177440,179120,obviously you needed everything the best
_KuLPKPzmcY,179120,180879,quality fabrics and i'm pretty sure that
_KuLPKPzmcY,180879,183440,the less well-off women did not really
_KuLPKPzmcY,183440,184319,afford that
_KuLPKPzmcY,184319,186720,but in general yeah like it was
_KuLPKPzmcY,186720,188159,definitely something that
_KuLPKPzmcY,188159,190000,was kind of like affordable like you can
_KuLPKPzmcY,190000,191280,you can see
_KuLPKPzmcY,191280,193840,photos of those like street sellers
_KuLPKPzmcY,193840,195760,selling crinolines and even the used
_KuLPKPzmcY,195760,197440,ones they could still give you the right
_KuLPKPzmcY,197440,198239,silhouette
_KuLPKPzmcY,198239,200159,which you know made things a lot easier
_KuLPKPzmcY,200159,201440,because if you were working
_KuLPKPzmcY,201440,203760,um i'm guessing like eight pedicles were
_KuLPKPzmcY,203760,204959,not your jam
_KuLPKPzmcY,204959,207120,but there are several problems with that
_KuLPKPzmcY,207120,208400,particular tiktaar
_KuLPKPzmcY,208400,211280,and i i just feel like the the first
_KuLPKPzmcY,211280,212239,part with
_KuLPKPzmcY,212239,214400,like the sexual harassment and things
_KuLPKPzmcY,214400,216000,it's like something we want to believe
_KuLPKPzmcY,216000,217760,is true because it sounds so cool
_KuLPKPzmcY,217760,220879,but and empowering and i admit i
_KuLPKPzmcY,220879,221519,personally
_KuLPKPzmcY,221519,223280,don't believe that every social media
_KuLPKPzmcY,223280,224560,post should come with a full
_KuLPKPzmcY,224560,226159,bibliography and
_KuLPKPzmcY,226159,228239,in fact i rarely list sources in my
_KuLPKPzmcY,228239,229840,videos but that comes from
_KuLPKPzmcY,229840,231680,mostly the fact that you know it's hard
_KuLPKPzmcY,231680,233760,to list sources of your knowledge that
_KuLPKPzmcY,233760,235599,you accumulated over the years of being
_KuLPKPzmcY,235599,236959,interested in a topic like
_KuLPKPzmcY,236959,239439,i don't know what to link to prove that
_KuLPKPzmcY,239439,241040,1880 skirts were
_KuLPKPzmcY,241040,242959,asymmetrical most of the time it's just
_KuLPKPzmcY,242959,244159,something that i learned because i've
_KuLPKPzmcY,244159,245840,been looking at the fashion planes for
_KuLPKPzmcY,245840,246480,so long
_KuLPKPzmcY,246480,248000,but if you present a piece of
_KuLPKPzmcY,248000,249599,information that is sort of
_KuLPKPzmcY,249599,250480,controversial
_KuLPKPzmcY,250480,253360,or like ground breaking you usually want
_KuLPKPzmcY,253360,254000,to back it
_KuLPKPzmcY,254000,256239,up so i'm a little bit confused by the
_KuLPKPzmcY,256239,258000,date like why 1846
_KuLPKPzmcY,258000,260320,was it a year where men were
_KuLPKPzmcY,260320,262320,particularly harassing women
_KuLPKPzmcY,262320,264639,i don't think so was it a year acrylene
_KuLPKPzmcY,264639,265600,was invented
_KuLPKPzmcY,265600,268000,not really crinolines as in spring steel
_KuLPKPzmcY,268000,269440,cage skirts they were
_KuLPKPzmcY,269440,271919,patented in 1950s but they existed
_KuLPKPzmcY,271919,273840,before that in various forms
_KuLPKPzmcY,273840,275199,they didn't come out of nowhere like
_KuLPKPzmcY,275199,276560,everything in fashion history it was a
_KuLPKPzmcY,276560,277280,gradual
_KuLPKPzmcY,277280,280720,process so throughout 1820s to 1840s and
_KuLPKPzmcY,280720,282960,during 1850s women's skirts were like
_KuLPKPzmcY,282960,284880,gradually getting bigger and bigger and
_KuLPKPzmcY,284880,286479,fluffier and gaining volume
_KuLPKPzmcY,286479,288400,and this was achieved mostly by wearing
_KuLPKPzmcY,288400,290320,multiple petticoats some of which were
_KuLPKPzmcY,290320,292560,stiffened with things like horse hair or
_KuLPKPzmcY,292560,294639,cord you can imagine these things
_KuLPKPzmcY,294639,296080,started getting really heavy
_KuLPKPzmcY,296080,297600,at some point like there was a lot of
_KuLPKPzmcY,297600,300160,layers it must have been also hot
_KuLPKPzmcY,300160,302080,and people started thinking of like
_KuLPKPzmcY,302080,303520,smart alternatives
_KuLPKPzmcY,303520,305600,it was mostly just comfort it is
_KuLPKPzmcY,305600,307360,possible that women did feel
_KuLPKPzmcY,307360,309680,safer wearing those but printed ones
_KuLPKPzmcY,309680,311280,weren't those like huge
_KuLPKPzmcY,311280,313759,stiff structures that you would just
_KuLPKPzmcY,313759,314960,like roll around in
_KuLPKPzmcY,314960,318240,an average 1860s crinoline was like
_KuLPKPzmcY,318240,322320,around 35 inches or 89 centimeters in
_KuLPKPzmcY,322320,324800,diameter so that's not that big
_KuLPKPzmcY,324800,326720,and it was flexible not to mention it's
_KuLPKPzmcY,326720,328639,suede like if someone walked up to you
_KuLPKPzmcY,328639,329440,really close
_KuLPKPzmcY,329440,331600,it would just sway back i think it would
_KuLPKPzmcY,331600,333199,be fantastic if there was a single
_KuLPKPzmcY,333199,334720,garment that could prevent
_KuLPKPzmcY,334720,337520,men from harassing women but as we know
_KuLPKPzmcY,337520,338000,clothes
_KuLPKPzmcY,338000,340960,don't really matter so i'm sorry to say
_KuLPKPzmcY,340960,342639,like as much as we all want it
_KuLPKPzmcY,342639,345360,to be true i don't think it is do you
_KuLPKPzmcY,345360,346960,ever look at paintings and think oh my
_KuLPKPzmcY,346960,347440,god
_KuLPKPzmcY,347440,349600,how bad did they smell you're a tutor
_KuLPKPzmcY,349600,351680,living in the bustling city of london
_KuLPKPzmcY,351680,353280,and because of a lack of understanding
_KuLPKPzmcY,353280,355360,about bacteria and how it works you're
_KuLPKPzmcY,355360,357039,allowed to dump your human and animal
_KuLPKPzmcY,357039,357440,waste
_KuLPKPzmcY,357440,359840,into any old lake or river and of course
_KuLPKPzmcY,359840,362240,the largest river by you is the tams
_KuLPKPzmcY,362240,364160,this turned the tams into a literal
_KuLPKPzmcY,364160,365360,cessed pool
_KuLPKPzmcY,365360,368639,we're talking like cholera city in turn
_KuLPKPzmcY,368639,370560,this has led an entire group of people
_KuLPKPzmcY,370560,372880,to believe that water spreads bacteria
_KuLPKPzmcY,372880,374000,and i'll give them this if you're
_KuLPKPzmcY,374000,376000,bathing in cholera infested lakes then
_KuLPKPzmcY,376000,376880,yes it will
_KuLPKPzmcY,376880,378560,so to prevent the catching of such
_KuLPKPzmcY,378560,380000,disgusting diseases
_KuLPKPzmcY,380000,383600,tutors didn't bathe in water like ever
_KuLPKPzmcY,383600,385280,instead they rubbed down their body with
_KuLPKPzmcY,385280,387680,linen cloths and if you were wealthy it
_KuLPKPzmcY,387680,389280,changed your chemise every day
_KuLPKPzmcY,389280,391520,no one would ever go without a chemise
_KuLPKPzmcY,391520,392880,ever hmm
_KuLPKPzmcY,392880,395680,i am not an authority on tutor fashion
_KuLPKPzmcY,395680,396639,but if something
_KuLPKPzmcY,396639,399120,sounds really scandalous and
_KuLPKPzmcY,399120,400960,controversial it's probably
_KuLPKPzmcY,400960,402800,it could be a myth i'm a bit confused
_KuLPKPzmcY,402800,404479,because i know about the
_KuLPKPzmcY,404479,407759,custom of lining your bathtub with linen
_KuLPKPzmcY,407759,408080,so
_KuLPKPzmcY,408080,409680,maybe that's where that comes from
_KuLPKPzmcY,409680,412800,because i genuinely do believe they paid
_KuLPKPzmcY,412800,413599,themselves
_KuLPKPzmcY,413599,415360,according to the website on the tutor
_KuLPKPzmcY,415360,417599,trail which is hosted by
_KuLPKPzmcY,417599,420080,a researcher in order to have a bath
_KuLPKPzmcY,420080,422000,most tutors would have had to find
_KuLPKPzmcY,422000,424400,a wooden tub line it with sheets collect
_KuLPKPzmcY,424400,425599,buckets of water
_KuLPKPzmcY,425599,427599,heat the water by the fireplace and fill
_KuLPKPzmcY,427599,429440,the tub it's probably safe to assume
_KuLPKPzmcY,429440,431280,that this complicated process probably
_KuLPKPzmcY,431280,432479,dissuaded
_KuLPKPzmcY,432479,434639,people from bathing daily there was
_KuLPKPzmcY,434639,436080,though nothing stopping them from
_KuLPKPzmcY,436080,438000,washing daily the distinction being that
_KuLPKPzmcY,438000,439840,bathing required a person to immerse
_KuLPKPzmcY,439840,441680,themselves in a bathtub and washing was
_KuLPKPzmcY,441680,443440,more like a sponge bath so it's kind of
_KuLPKPzmcY,443440,444800,like a shower isn't it
_KuLPKPzmcY,444800,446960,like unless you immerse yourself in
_KuLPKPzmcY,446960,448800,water can you actually say that you
_KuLPKPzmcY,448800,449280,bathe
_KuLPKPzmcY,449280,451280,i mean we do have descriptions of like
_KuLPKPzmcY,451280,452800,literal bathrooms
_KuLPKPzmcY,452800,455520,from the tudor era so what would they do
_KuLPKPzmcY,455520,456880,in those if not
_KuLPKPzmcY,456880,458880,bathe but it is true though that they
_KuLPKPzmcY,458880,460000,wore chemistry
_KuLPKPzmcY,460000,463360,shemises every day or like shifts really
_KuLPKPzmcY,463360,465919,i mean probably from a modern viewpoint
_KuLPKPzmcY,465919,467280,a lot of hygiene
_KuLPKPzmcY,467280,470160,costumes are were really outdated and
_KuLPKPzmcY,470160,471440,really dangerous but
_KuLPKPzmcY,471440,473280,you know i'm not sure about this one
_KuLPKPzmcY,473280,474879,though marie antoinette's disturbing
_KuLPKPzmcY,474879,476560,beauty routine she's famous for this
_KuLPKPzmcY,476560,476960,face
_KuLPKPzmcY,476960,478879,which consisted of flowers cucumbers
_KuLPKPzmcY,478879,480639,lemons crumbs of french rolls white wine
_KuLPKPzmcY,480639,482160,and the secret ingredient pigeons which
_KuLPKPzmcY,482160,483840,were student fermented for 17 days for
_KuLPKPzmcY,483840,485280,her foundation she would have used a
_KuLPKPzmcY,485280,486960,highly toxic white chalk made with
_KuLPKPzmcY,486960,488160,lead and finished it with the sanded
_KuLPKPzmcY,488160,489599,powder russian lipstick was made from
_KuLPKPzmcY,489599,491280,red mercury and was also applied to the
_KuLPKPzmcY,491280,493120,earlobes since smallpox left many people
_KuLPKPzmcY,493120,494720,with dark spots or scars fake beauty
_KuLPKPzmcY,494720,496240,marks made of silk or velvet were very
_KuLPKPzmcY,496240,497919,common finally marie surrounded herself
_KuLPKPzmcY,497919,499360,with perfume and pleasant sense to
_KuLPKPzmcY,499360,500800,combat the smell of their terrible
_KuLPKPzmcY,500800,502000,sewage systems
_KuLPKPzmcY,502000,505199,um i don't think so like i mean some of
_KuLPKPzmcY,505199,506000,this again i
_KuLPKPzmcY,506000,507919,i don't think a single fashion history
_KuLPKPzmcY,507919,509759,tick tock that i've watched so far was
_KuLPKPzmcY,509759,510879,like completely wrong
_KuLPKPzmcY,510879,512640,a lot of it is true like yes they did
_KuLPKPzmcY,512640,514320,wear tiny patches
_KuLPKPzmcY,514320,515680,i'm not sure how they're called in
_KuLPKPzmcY,515680,517279,english but in polish they're quote
_KuLPKPzmcY,517279,518159,called
_KuLPKPzmcY,518159,520479,mushki to cover skin imperfections it
_KuLPKPzmcY,520479,521200,was actually
_KuLPKPzmcY,521200,523279,a popular thing to do probably a little
_KuLPKPzmcY,523279,525600,bit before marie antoinette was hot
_KuLPKPzmcY,525600,526000,stuff
_KuLPKPzmcY,526000,528880,but again if we read something about
_KuLPKPzmcY,528880,529920,hygiene
_KuLPKPzmcY,529920,534240,or ridiculous customs in 18th century or
_KuLPKPzmcY,534240,536320,you know in any way in the past we have
_KuLPKPzmcY,536320,538000,to take it with a grain of salt because
_KuLPKPzmcY,538000,539120,a lot of it is
_KuLPKPzmcY,539120,541440,people in the 19th century inventing
_KuLPKPzmcY,541440,543440,things to make themselves feel better
_KuLPKPzmcY,543440,545839,and with marie antoinette's pigeon face
_KuLPKPzmcY,545839,547519,mask or a cream or whatever
_KuLPKPzmcY,547519,549600,i cannot find a single source confirming
_KuLPKPzmcY,549600,551279,this because i got really interested in
_KuLPKPzmcY,551279,552000,because i was like
_KuLPKPzmcY,552000,554080,what was the source of this rumor and i
_KuLPKPzmcY,554080,555839,think the thing that proves that this
_KuLPKPzmcY,555839,558160,is actually a rumor is that different
_KuLPKPzmcY,558160,558880,sources
_KuLPKPzmcY,558880,561120,either list that the pigeons were
_KuLPKPzmcY,561120,562160,fermented for
_KuLPKPzmcY,562160,565120,17 days or they say that there were 17
_KuLPKPzmcY,565120,567600,pigeons involved so i think that shows
_KuLPKPzmcY,567600,570320,how this information was misconstrued
_KuLPKPzmcY,570320,572480,over the ages like it probably started
_KuLPKPzmcY,572480,575120,with something like a word written badly
_KuLPKPzmcY,575120,576080,on a piece of paper
_KuLPKPzmcY,576080,578320,that was read as a pigeon later on you
_KuLPKPzmcY,578320,579200,know it's so
_KuLPKPzmcY,579200,582399,obviously a rumor to me at least
_KuLPKPzmcY,582399,584320,i think but it is true that a lot of
_KuLPKPzmcY,584320,586080,formulas at the time did use
_KuLPKPzmcY,586080,587760,substances that we consider toxic
_KuLPKPzmcY,587760,589440,nowadays the thing is though like
_KuLPKPzmcY,589440,592240,if those things seriously affected
_KuLPKPzmcY,592240,593360,someone's health
_KuLPKPzmcY,593360,595200,and they were still used for like
_KuLPKPzmcY,595200,597200,decades or centuries even
_KuLPKPzmcY,597200,598880,wouldn't they notice that something is
_KuLPKPzmcY,598880,600720,off like wouldn't they be like damn it a
_KuLPKPzmcY,600720,603040,patch of my skin just peeled off again
_KuLPKPzmcY,603040,605200,i guess it's not my lead-based cream i
_KuLPKPzmcY,605200,607279,think it all sounds really exciting and
_KuLPKPzmcY,607279,607760,like
_KuLPKPzmcY,607760,609839,scary but when you think about it those
_KuLPKPzmcY,609839,610880,must have been
_KuLPKPzmcY,610880,613279,really small amounts to leave them like
_KuLPKPzmcY,613279,615440,mostly unaffected because if they were
_KuLPKPzmcY,615440,617120,all affected by it they would probably
_KuLPKPzmcY,617120,619040,change the ingredients right
_KuLPKPzmcY,619040,620959,like we know that marie antoinette did
_KuLPKPzmcY,620959,622959,not die because of those cosmetics that
_KuLPKPzmcY,622959,624880,she used why does it keep closing every
_KuLPKPzmcY,624880,626320,single time
_KuLPKPzmcY,626320,629360,i just noticed that there is 240 million
_KuLPKPzmcY,629360,631760,views of the fashion history hashtag so
_KuLPKPzmcY,631760,633279,you all know that line from all that
_KuLPKPzmcY,633279,634320,jazz where it's like
_KuLPKPzmcY,634320,636560,gonna bruise my knees and roll my
_KuLPKPzmcY,636560,638560,stockings down
_KuLPKPzmcY,638560,640640,well here's some fun facts about the
_KuLPKPzmcY,640640,641600,1920s
_KuLPKPzmcY,641600,643519,courtesy of me your local nerd who is
_KuLPKPzmcY,643519,645040,currently doing research
_KuLPKPzmcY,645040,647760,because i'm writing a story set in 1928
_KuLPKPzmcY,647760,649600,so with the 1920s flapper silhouette
_KuLPKPzmcY,649600,651920,women were no longer wearing corsets
_KuLPKPzmcY,651920,653519,no course it meant there was nowhere to
_KuLPKPzmcY,653519,655519,attach their garters to to hold up their
_KuLPKPzmcY,655519,656480,stockings
_KuLPKPzmcY,656480,658720,so it became the fashion to roll your
_KuLPKPzmcY,658720,660640,stockings down beneath your knees and
_KuLPKPzmcY,660640,660959,put
_KuLPKPzmcY,660959,664000,blush on your knees to like make them
_KuLPKPzmcY,664000,664320,look
_KuLPKPzmcY,664320,666480,cute i guess women's skirts at the time
_KuLPKPzmcY,666480,668399,typically fell below the knee
_KuLPKPzmcY,668399,670560,so they wouldn't really be seen normally
_KuLPKPzmcY,670560,672399,but when they dance their skirts would
_KuLPKPzmcY,672399,673360,flare up
_KuLPKPzmcY,673360,676560,but that's still not all for some women
_KuLPKPzmcY,676560,678399,rouging their knees with blush wasn't
_KuLPKPzmcY,678399,680399,enough they would
_KuLPKPzmcY,680399,684160,paint their knees what a power move
_KuLPKPzmcY,684160,686160,ladies ladies and ladies i think it is
_KuLPKPzmcY,686160,688160,high time we bring back
_KuLPKPzmcY,688160,691279,the pain yes i absolutely agree let's
_KuLPKPzmcY,691279,692079,bring back
_KuLPKPzmcY,692079,694399,painted knees so this is mostly correct
_KuLPKPzmcY,694399,695519,i mean apart from the
_KuLPKPzmcY,695519,696959,from the part where she says that
_KuLPKPzmcY,696959,699519,corsets were not worn in the 1920s
_KuLPKPzmcY,699519,701760,and you couldn't attach your stockings
_KuLPKPzmcY,701760,704000,anywhere that was somehow true like
_KuLPKPzmcY,704000,706240,a lot of people did stop wearing those
_KuLPKPzmcY,706240,708640,in the 1920s they stopped wearing any
_KuLPKPzmcY,708640,710160,sort of girdle or
_KuLPKPzmcY,710160,712959,corsalette and stuff like that so it was
_KuLPKPzmcY,712959,713360,true
_KuLPKPzmcY,713360,715600,that it made it difficult to attach your
_KuLPKPzmcY,715600,716560,stockings to
_KuLPKPzmcY,716560,718320,to anything because you didn't do it to
_KuLPKPzmcY,718320,720240,your pants obviously so yeah
_KuLPKPzmcY,720240,723519,stockings that were held by horizontal
_KuLPKPzmcY,723519,725600,garters rather than vertical
_KuLPKPzmcY,725600,728320,came back to fashion and it is true that
_KuLPKPzmcY,728320,730079,with the shorter skirts they didn't
_KuLPKPzmcY,730079,732160,expose knees but they were significantly
_KuLPKPzmcY,732160,732959,shorter
_KuLPKPzmcY,732959,735440,than they used to be some knees flashed
_KuLPKPzmcY,735440,736160,here and there
_KuLPKPzmcY,736160,739279,during a wild night of dances so it was
_KuLPKPzmcY,739279,741440,something new it was completely new like
_KuLPKPzmcY,741440,743839,in western fashion history this has not
_KuLPKPzmcY,743839,744800,happened for like
_KuLPKPzmcY,744800,747600,thousands of years and because of that
_KuLPKPzmcY,747600,748480,people were like
_KuLPKPzmcY,748480,751360,well i have not seen any before in my
_KuLPKPzmcY,751360,753519,life and i have not exposed any before
_KuLPKPzmcY,753519,754240,in my life
_KuLPKPzmcY,754240,756800,why not make it special so this sadly
_KuLPKPzmcY,756800,758240,was a short-lived trend
_KuLPKPzmcY,758240,760320,because in 1930s the skirts started
_KuLPKPzmcY,760320,761760,getting a bit longer again
_KuLPKPzmcY,761760,763440,again it probably only applies to it
_KuLPKPzmcY,763440,764959,like younger generation
_KuLPKPzmcY,764959,768160,the more emancipated women
_KuLPKPzmcY,768160,771600,those that were like partying those that
_KuLPKPzmcY,771600,772079,were
_KuLPKPzmcY,772079,774800,independent not necessarily or like
_KuLPKPzmcY,774800,776240,average aristocrat
_KuLPKPzmcY,776240,777920,rooting her knees for absolutely no
_KuLPKPzmcY,777920,780079,reason but yeah let's bring this
_KuLPKPzmcY,780079,783519,back your favorite whatever
_KuLPKPzmcY,783519,785600,says about you you're going with the
_KuLPKPzmcY,785600,787920,safe choice maybe a bit basic but you're
_KuLPKPzmcY,787920,789279,not wrong
_KuLPKPzmcY,789279,791279,is this one really your favorite or were
_KuLPKPzmcY,791279,793360,you just told it should be
_KuLPKPzmcY,793360,794959,you're either really awesome or you
_KuLPKPzmcY,794959,797600,really suck no middle ground
_KuLPKPzmcY,797600,800000,you are the middle ground you are a very
_KuLPKPzmcY,800000,800639,neutral
_KuLPKPzmcY,800639,803920,person you like the classics hey that's
_KuLPKPzmcY,803920,805360,my dad's favorite
_KuLPKPzmcY,805360,808360,hey that's my mom's favorite you
_KuLPKPzmcY,808360,809600,pretentious
_KuLPKPzmcY,809600,814240, you piece of hipster
_KuLPKPzmcY,814240,817360,you're cool like actually cool
_KuLPKPzmcY,817360,820079,you are what the hipsters think they are
_KuLPKPzmcY,820079,821680,you are a child
_KuLPKPzmcY,821680,823519,and i mean that literally like you're
_KuLPKPzmcY,823519,825199,not yet a teenager
_KuLPKPzmcY,825199,828000,you are a child and i mean that as an
_KuLPKPzmcY,828000,829440,insult
_KuLPKPzmcY,829440,832560,you are a contrarian you do not exist
_KuLPKPzmcY,832560,835600,this is no one's favorite
_KuLPKPzmcY,835600,838160,this is so good i need more like
_KuLPKPzmcY,838160,839440,costumer memes
_KuLPKPzmcY,839440,841680,on tech talk there is something like
_KuLPKPzmcY,841680,843360,it's so strange because i've met
_KuLPKPzmcY,843360,845360,people from like all different sorts of
_KuLPKPzmcY,845360,847120,backgrounds and they all had different
_KuLPKPzmcY,847120,849440,interests and like almost every costumer
_KuLPKPzmcY,849440,851120,has like five different eras that
_KuLPKPzmcY,851120,852800,they're their favorite but there is
_KuLPKPzmcY,852800,854639,something special about people obsessed
_KuLPKPzmcY,854639,856000,with 18th century there is just
_KuLPKPzmcY,856000,858240,like it's a different brand of people i
_KuLPKPzmcY,858240,859120,don't know why
_KuLPKPzmcY,859120,861920,like they are obsessed and bridger 10 on
_KuLPKPzmcY,861920,863760,netflix one of my favorite costuming
_KuLPKPzmcY,863760,864480,details
_KuLPKPzmcY,864480,866800,is marina thompson's lover's eye
_KuLPKPzmcY,866800,867680,necklace
_KuLPKPzmcY,867680,869040,it was one of the first things that i
_KuLPKPzmcY,869040,870800,noticed about marina's character
_KuLPKPzmcY,870800,873199,especially because it signals that she
_KuLPKPzmcY,873199,873920,has
_KuLPKPzmcY,873920,876880,a lover so her necklace was based on a
_KuLPKPzmcY,876880,879040,real trend that started in the late 18th
_KuLPKPzmcY,879040,881120,century and continued into the 19th
_KuLPKPzmcY,881120,881920,century
_KuLPKPzmcY,881920,884320,where essentially you have a miniature
_KuLPKPzmcY,884320,885199,painting
_KuLPKPzmcY,885199,888480,of your lover's eye and then that way it
_KuLPKPzmcY,888480,889920,could keep their identity
_KuLPKPzmcY,889920,891839,a secret and you can view examples
_KuLPKPzmcY,891839,894000,online from museum collections you'll
_KuLPKPzmcY,894000,895040,frequently see them
_KuLPKPzmcY,895040,898000,on brooches sometimes rings and even
_KuLPKPzmcY,898000,898720,pendants
_KuLPKPzmcY,898720,901279,and i find lovers eyes to be so charming
_KuLPKPzmcY,901279,903680,as you can see i am currently wearing
_KuLPKPzmcY,903680,906480,a replica lover's eye bro that's so cool
_KuLPKPzmcY,906480,907199,and i actually
_KuLPKPzmcY,907199,909279,never noticed that watching bridgette
_KuLPKPzmcY,909279,910800,probably because there was so much going
_KuLPKPzmcY,910800,912240,on with all the characters
_KuLPKPzmcY,912240,914480,and costumes it's such a sweet detail
_KuLPKPzmcY,914480,916160,like it really does tell you
_KuLPKPzmcY,916160,918560,a lot about the character and also can
_KuLPKPzmcY,918560,920320,we please bring these back
_KuLPKPzmcY,920320,922959,because this is so cute like there is a
_KuLPKPzmcY,922959,924959,lot of metallic content under the
_KuLPKPzmcY,924959,926480,fashion history tic tocs
_KuLPKPzmcY,926480,929040,is it history already if it's 2019 i
_KuLPKPzmcY,929040,931519,guess it is and makes me feel very old
_KuLPKPzmcY,931519,933759,and irrelevant okay so here is the trend
_KuLPKPzmcY,933759,935360,that i wanted to address while we're
_KuLPKPzmcY,935360,938079,still at it this one has 61 million
_KuLPKPzmcY,938079,938639,views
_KuLPKPzmcY,938639,940480,music is copyrighted so i'm just gonna
_KuLPKPzmcY,940480,942320,sing something similar uh you'll bring
_KuLPKPzmcY,942320,945120,the corsets yeah
_KuLPKPzmcY,945120,947199,uh we'll bring the cinders no one wants
_KuLPKPzmcY,947199,949600,a waste over nine inches
_KuLPKPzmcY,949600,952880,no one wants a waste no no so this
_KuLPKPzmcY,952880,954800,started a whole picture trend
_KuLPKPzmcY,954800,957600,where you would take a corset and like
_KuLPKPzmcY,957600,958160,cinch
_KuLPKPzmcY,958160,960880,in it like just tighten it again
_KuLPKPzmcY,960880,962880,copyrighted so let me just uh turn it
_KuLPKPzmcY,962880,964480,into a spoken word
_KuLPKPzmcY,964480,968160,you bring the corsets
_KuLPKPzmcY,968160,971680,we will bring the centers
_KuLPKPzmcY,971680,975199,no one wants a waist over
_KuLPKPzmcY,975199,978480,nine inches thank you so much i think
_KuLPKPzmcY,978480,981279,my main problem with it is that it's
_KuLPKPzmcY,981279,982480,dangerous
_KuLPKPzmcY,982480,984240,like as much as i've been talking about
_KuLPKPzmcY,984240,986240,first it's not being harmful and my
_KuLPKPzmcY,986240,988320,course is basically being underwear
_KuLPKPzmcY,988320,990480,this ain't it don't do it first of
_KuLPKPzmcY,990480,992399,all that is not a core set
_KuLPKPzmcY,992399,994639,let me present it to you i actually have
_KuLPKPzmcY,994639,996240,the same thing because that's the
_KuLPKPzmcY,996240,998079,the cheapest thing you can find on
_KuLPKPzmcY,998079,999440,amazon um
_KuLPKPzmcY,999440,1002079,this thing it's not shaped like a corset
_KuLPKPzmcY,1002079,1004399,it's not boned like a corset like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1004399,1006320,this is what the bones do it's basically
_KuLPKPzmcY,1006320,1007519,it's not a core set
_KuLPKPzmcY,1007519,1010320,it's 18 like how good can it be so the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1010320,1011199,problem with it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1011199,1013519,is that it's not made as a core set like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1013519,1015199,if you look at the shape of it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1015199,1017199,if i close it there is almost no
_KuLPKPzmcY,1017199,1018480,difference
_KuLPKPzmcY,1018480,1020720,between the top and the bottom um there
_KuLPKPzmcY,1020720,1022639,is no space for the hips there
_KuLPKPzmcY,1022639,1025280,and it's really unhealthy so my problem
_KuLPKPzmcY,1025280,1027280,is if you wear a corset like this for
_KuLPKPzmcY,1027280,1028240,your outfit
_KuLPKPzmcY,1028240,1030240,that's all cool it's probably not going
_KuLPKPzmcY,1030240,1032000,to do anything because it's soft and
_KuLPKPzmcY,1032000,1033678,it's probably not going to hurt you but
_KuLPKPzmcY,1033678,1036480,if you try to suddenly tighten it that's
_KuLPKPzmcY,1036480,1037360,where it gets
_KuLPKPzmcY,1037360,1039199,nasty and i've seen a lot of these
_KuLPKPzmcY,1039199,1040720,trends where people were taking even
_KuLPKPzmcY,1040720,1042160,better mate horses
_KuLPKPzmcY,1042160,1044000,and we're just trying to like tighten
_KuLPKPzmcY,1044000,1046000,them as fast as possible that ain't it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1046000,1048640,first of all the corset will be damaged
_KuLPKPzmcY,1048640,1049440,second of all
_KuLPKPzmcY,1049440,1051360,your body will be damaged and i'm not
_KuLPKPzmcY,1051360,1052799,even going to mention the fact that a
_KuLPKPzmcY,1052799,1053919,lot of these people
_KuLPKPzmcY,1053919,1055919,like the first girl are doing it without
_KuLPKPzmcY,1055919,1057440,shamises on anyway
_KuLPKPzmcY,1057440,1061440,um wait i'm gonna show you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1061440,1064000,so this bad boy here is already pressing
_KuLPKPzmcY,1064000,1064880,on my hips
_KuLPKPzmcY,1064880,1067280,while it's still loose here it's because
_KuLPKPzmcY,1067280,1069200,it wasn't made for me and it also
_KuLPKPzmcY,1069200,1070950,doesn't have any hip space
_KuLPKPzmcY,1070950,1073679,[Music]
_KuLPKPzmcY,1073679,1076720,and as a comparison we have this bad boy
_KuLPKPzmcY,1076720,1078640,which was made to my measurements and
_KuLPKPzmcY,1078640,1080400,it's not even laced yet
_KuLPKPzmcY,1080400,1082480,like it's still open but you can tell
_KuLPKPzmcY,1082480,1084400,that there is enough space for my hips
_KuLPKPzmcY,1084400,1084720,here
_KuLPKPzmcY,1084720,1087039,do i mean that you only can wear made to
_KuLPKPzmcY,1087039,1088960,measure corsets absolutely not
_KuLPKPzmcY,1088960,1091120,but please invest in some good quality
_KuLPKPzmcY,1091120,1093200,ones there is a whole page
_KuLPKPzmcY,1093200,1096000,dedicated to that so if you google uh
_KuLPKPzmcY,1096000,1097600,lucy's corsetry
_KuLPKPzmcY,1097600,1100160,research corset brands there is a corset
_KuLPKPzmcY,1100160,1101120,shopping guide
_KuLPKPzmcY,1101120,1103679,and it tells you it shows you a whole
_KuLPKPzmcY,1103679,1106400,map of corset makers and it also
_KuLPKPzmcY,1106400,1108720,gives you a list of corset brands by
_KuLPKPzmcY,1108720,1109600,price range
_KuLPKPzmcY,1109600,1111520,and because it's a person that has
_KuLPKPzmcY,1111520,1113600,actually been involved in the corsetry
_KuLPKPzmcY,1113600,1114799,community for like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1114799,1117200,ages she knows what she's saying so she
_KuLPKPzmcY,1117200,1117919,will
_KuLPKPzmcY,1117919,1119840,let you know how to avoid the bad
_KuLPKPzmcY,1119840,1121200,corsets she also
_KuLPKPzmcY,1121200,1122960,has reviewed a lot of these so if you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1122960,1124640,want to invest in a corset
_KuLPKPzmcY,1124640,1127360,just go to that website and like don't
_KuLPKPzmcY,1127360,1129520,go to amazon because this stuff is just
_KuLPKPzmcY,1129520,1130320,fake like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1130320,1132480,i fell for that when i was like 20
_KuLPKPzmcY,1132480,1134880,because i i googled the cheapest corset
_KuLPKPzmcY,1134880,1135520,possible
_KuLPKPzmcY,1135520,1138480,and this showed up and like it's it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1138480,1140559,does not look like it does on a picture
_KuLPKPzmcY,1140559,1142400,it does not have the wasp waist
_KuLPKPzmcY,1142400,1144480,and if it does it's because you tied it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1144480,1150000,too tightly
_KuLPKPzmcY,1150000,1154160,what the mask is that's what the point
_KuLPKPzmcY,1154160,1154640,of the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1154640,1165840,mask is oh this deserves a super light
_KuLPKPzmcY,1186080,1188080,i like it not only because it's like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1188080,1189840,super nostalgic and makes you want to
_KuLPKPzmcY,1189840,1190320,cry
_KuLPKPzmcY,1190320,1192880,but also because it shows the variety of
_KuLPKPzmcY,1192880,1194880,waist sizes like you can clearly see
_KuLPKPzmcY,1194880,1196880,some ladies with like extremely small
_KuLPKPzmcY,1196880,1197520,lace
_KuLPKPzmcY,1197520,1199360,which is probably because they had them
_KuLPKPzmcY,1199360,1201280,naturally like i personally know a
_KuLPKPzmcY,1201280,1203600,couple of people that naturally possess
_KuLPKPzmcY,1203600,1206000,really small ways and you know you don't
_KuLPKPzmcY,1206000,1207919,really get to see that much nowadays
_KuLPKPzmcY,1207919,1209039,because not
_KuLPKPzmcY,1209039,1211120,every type of clothing accentuate those
_KuLPKPzmcY,1211120,1213120,but if you lived back then
_KuLPKPzmcY,1213120,1215200,when clothing was literally made to
_KuLPKPzmcY,1215200,1216640,accentuate your waist
_KuLPKPzmcY,1216640,1218320,that's what it would look like like you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1218320,1220000,would just see your friends with the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1220000,1221840,bigger waist smaller waist
_KuLPKPzmcY,1221840,1224480,you can see on that video that a lot of
_KuLPKPzmcY,1224480,1224960,women
_KuLPKPzmcY,1224960,1227600,have regularly sized waists and actually
_KuLPKPzmcY,1227600,1229440,if you look at the statistics of like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1229440,1231120,average waist sizes
_KuLPKPzmcY,1231120,1234400,not too bad it's it sounds possible
_KuLPKPzmcY,1234400,1236799,like considering they they all had a
_KuLPKPzmcY,1236799,1238640,completely different diet as well
_KuLPKPzmcY,1238640,1242240,by the 1870s the dress
_KuLPKPzmcY,1242240,1246000,the bustle was in style replacing
_KuLPKPzmcY,1246000,1248960,the hoop skirt
_KuLPKPzmcY,1251340,1255440,[Music]
_KuLPKPzmcY,1255440,1258799,she's so funny i love when museums do
_KuLPKPzmcY,1258799,1260080,tick tocks because
_KuLPKPzmcY,1260080,1262320,they usually like they're not as cringy
_KuLPKPzmcY,1262320,1264159,as you would think i love the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1264159,1266720,uffizi gallery like adapting tic tac
_KuLPKPzmcY,1266720,1268000,trends to like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1268000,1269840,the stuff they have at the museum it's
_KuLPKPzmcY,1269840,1272480,hilarious here is some copyrighted waltz
_KuLPKPzmcY,1272480,1273120,music
_KuLPKPzmcY,1273120,1275770,a one two three one two
_KuLPKPzmcY,1275770,1281609,[Music]
_KuLPKPzmcY,1282400,1284480,i think the problem with fashion history
_KuLPKPzmcY,1284480,1285840,is that aesthetics
_KuLPKPzmcY,1285840,1288320,often come before interest in actual
_KuLPKPzmcY,1288320,1289120,history
_KuLPKPzmcY,1289120,1291840,so we discover what we like by the looks
_KuLPKPzmcY,1291840,1292720,of it first
_KuLPKPzmcY,1292720,1295360,and then we place it in a particular
_KuLPKPzmcY,1295360,1297520,period and also then we discover the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1297520,1298799,context in which
_KuLPKPzmcY,1298799,1301360,those dresses or outfits were worn i
_KuLPKPzmcY,1301360,1302720,think it's different when you're just
_KuLPKPzmcY,1302720,1304240,interested in history because obviously
_KuLPKPzmcY,1304240,1305679,if you're interested in the medieval
_KuLPKPzmcY,1305679,1307600,times you would also be interested in
_KuLPKPzmcY,1307600,1309760,you know not only the wars i guess but
_KuLPKPzmcY,1309760,1310240,also
_KuLPKPzmcY,1310240,1312640,what kind of technology they used and
_KuLPKPzmcY,1312640,1314720,what daily lives look like whereas in
_KuLPKPzmcY,1314720,1315840,fashion history is kind of like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1315840,1316720,secondary
_KuLPKPzmcY,1316720,1318960,like you should be interested in that
_KuLPKPzmcY,1318960,1321440,but also you don't necessarily
_KuLPKPzmcY,1321440,1324159,absolutely have to know how many times a
_KuLPKPzmcY,1324159,1325200,day they ate
_KuLPKPzmcY,1325200,1326720,if you know what i mean buy it you don't
_KuLPKPzmcY,1326720,1330480,have to rationalize everything
_KuLPKPzmcY,1331360,1334320,all right i will buy it it'll be good
_KuLPKPzmcY,1334320,1336000,for the economy
_KuLPKPzmcY,1336000,1338799,she looks like a million bucks so it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1338799,1341039,definitely is good for the economy
_KuLPKPzmcY,1341039,1343440,the only thing i would be wary of is
_KuLPKPzmcY,1343440,1344559,buying things of
_KuLPKPzmcY,1344559,1347120,amazon may end up badly for you because
_KuLPKPzmcY,1347120,1349200,they might not be what they look like in
_KuLPKPzmcY,1349200,1350000,the pictures
_KuLPKPzmcY,1350000,1354320,but other than that you know she looks
_KuLPKPzmcY,1358840,1361840,great
_KuLPKPzmcY,1364880,1367679,why does this make me laugh so much okay
_KuLPKPzmcY,1367679,1369280,oh okay so
_KuLPKPzmcY,1369280,1371360,this time it's playing the bridgerton
_KuLPKPzmcY,1371360,1372480,version of
_KuLPKPzmcY,1372480,1375360,vivaldi so i'll just make a flute cover
_KuLPKPzmcY,1375360,1376160,for that
_KuLPKPzmcY,1376160,1384339,[Music]
_KuLPKPzmcY,1384400,1387120,nearly 3 000 women died in a 10-year
_KuLPKPzmcY,1387120,1388960,period due to their crinoline hoop
_KuLPKPzmcY,1388960,1390559,skirts catching fire
_KuLPKPzmcY,1390559,1392799,they were also dragged or crushed by
_KuLPKPzmcY,1392799,1395919,passing carriages and machinery
_KuLPKPzmcY,1395919,1398400,again if anything sounds really like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1398400,1399280,shocking
_KuLPKPzmcY,1399280,1402480,it's usually blown out of proportion but
_KuLPKPzmcY,1402480,1405120,i am willing to believe that it must
_KuLPKPzmcY,1405120,1405919,have been
_KuLPKPzmcY,1405919,1408640,some some sort of way dangerous
_KuLPKPzmcY,1408640,1409760,especially with like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1409760,1411919,all of the fire that was involved in
_KuLPKPzmcY,1411919,1413679,your daily life like you know you would
_KuLPKPzmcY,1413679,1414640,spend time
_KuLPKPzmcY,1414640,1417440,in a candlelit room most of the time and
_KuLPKPzmcY,1417440,1419679,not to mention the fireplaces so
_KuLPKPzmcY,1419679,1420960,yeah obviously it must have been
_KuLPKPzmcY,1420960,1422799,dangerous at the same time
_KuLPKPzmcY,1422799,1425520,was it that common if women continued to
_KuLPKPzmcY,1425520,1426480,wear
_KuLPKPzmcY,1426480,1429600,hoop skirts crinolines and wide
_KuLPKPzmcY,1429600,1432640,long skirts personally i have no idea
_KuLPKPzmcY,1432640,1434480,maybe it was just a matter of like being
_KuLPKPzmcY,1434480,1435760,really careful
_KuLPKPzmcY,1435760,1438320,maybe in 100 years people will be like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1438320,1440240,do you know how many women
_KuLPKPzmcY,1440240,1444240,died during the 2020s because their high
_KuLPKPzmcY,1444240,1446400,heels got caught in a rail track
_KuLPKPzmcY,1446400,1449279,r.i.p old style bonnets are really quite
_KuLPKPzmcY,1449279,1450240,handy
_KuLPKPzmcY,1450240,1452320,this part covers your face from getting
_KuLPKPzmcY,1452320,1453600,too much sun
_KuLPKPzmcY,1453600,1455679,and this part for the neck and this
_KuLPKPzmcY,1455679,1457440,puffy part is where you can hide
_KuLPKPzmcY,1457440,1459360,evidence for murders you've committed on
_KuLPKPzmcY,1459360,1460480,the organ trail
_KuLPKPzmcY,1460480,1463200,i'm not here to judge you know obviously
_KuLPKPzmcY,1463200,1463840,100
_KuLPKPzmcY,1463840,1465760,historically accurate that is absolutely
_KuLPKPzmcY,1465760,1467520,what happened which is why
_KuLPKPzmcY,1467520,1472320,bonnets were banned in 1894
_KuLPKPzmcY,1472320,1475039,because too many female murderers could
_KuLPKPzmcY,1475039,1476559,get away with it
_KuLPKPzmcY,1476559,1480159,a healthy reminder this
_KuLPKPzmcY,1480159,1484559,walked she shredded that runway mama
_KuLPKPzmcY,1484559,1488159,so that peppa could run
_KuLPKPzmcY,1488159,1491520,uh yeah oh my god okay
_KuLPKPzmcY,1491520,1494799,uh this is slowly leaving the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1494799,1497279,uh fashion history area of interest so
_KuLPKPzmcY,1497279,1498480,we're gonna stop there
_KuLPKPzmcY,1498480,1500640,i feel like i have missed half of the
_KuLPKPzmcY,1500640,1501600,good ones
_KuLPKPzmcY,1501600,1503600,so if you see a fashion history tick
_KuLPKPzmcY,1503600,1505679,tock don't don't hesitate to tag me and
_KuLPKPzmcY,1505679,1507200,maybe we'll have a part two
_KuLPKPzmcY,1507200,1509679,okey doke that's enough of this awful
_KuLPKPzmcY,1509679,1511120,app for the day
_KuLPKPzmcY,1511120,1513520,shout out to all the creators that got
_KuLPKPzmcY,1513520,1514720,picked up today
_KuLPKPzmcY,1514720,1517039,you're doing an amazing job and don't
_KuLPKPzmcY,1517039,1518880,worry about me criticizing you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1518880,1521200,it's just you know just pointing out
_KuLPKPzmcY,1521200,1522080,things that
_KuLPKPzmcY,1522080,1524720,maybe might have been checked twice you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1524720,1525919,know it's not your fault
_KuLPKPzmcY,1525919,1528960,actually if you type in the pigeon mari
_KuLPKPzmcY,1528960,1530720,antoinette face mask in google
_KuLPKPzmcY,1530720,1532559,there's like countless articles oh i
_KuLPKPzmcY,1532559,1534320,just spat into the camera there's like
_KuLPKPzmcY,1534320,1535760,countless articles
_KuLPKPzmcY,1535760,1538559,telling you that yes she did indeed use
_KuLPKPzmcY,1538559,1538960,that
_KuLPKPzmcY,1538960,1542720,as a face wash except it's like pages
_KuLPKPzmcY,1542720,1544400,like marie claire
_KuLPKPzmcY,1544400,1546960,and it's never the scientific sources so
_KuLPKPzmcY,1546960,1548799,unless you can pinpoint an
_KuLPKPzmcY,1548799,1552559,actual source like a book that tells you
_KuLPKPzmcY,1552559,1554880,yes this is what she wrote in her diary
_KuLPKPzmcY,1554880,1557279,she was like yes i used 17 pigeons
_KuLPKPzmcY,1557279,1559200,it was great one of them was
_KuLPKPzmcY,1559200,1560799,unfortunately a bit sick
_KuLPKPzmcY,1560799,1563039,that you should be skeptical of
_KuLPKPzmcY,1563039,1564480,everything you find online because
_KuLPKPzmcY,1564480,1565840,people are lying
_KuLPKPzmcY,1565840,1567840,and it's not your fault that you got
_KuLPKPzmcY,1567840,1569520,bamboozled but yeah
_KuLPKPzmcY,1569520,1572240,it's you know it happens like i've said
_KuLPKPzmcY,1572240,1574080,things in my past videos that are not
_KuLPKPzmcY,1574080,1575279,necessarily true
_KuLPKPzmcY,1575279,1577120,and i've learned that sin and you know
_KuLPKPzmcY,1577120,1579039,it's okay if if things that you said are
_KuLPKPzmcY,1579039,1579840,not correct
