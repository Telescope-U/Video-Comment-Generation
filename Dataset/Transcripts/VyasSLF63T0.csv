VyasSLF63T0,399,3120,okay guys welcome to another episode
VyasSLF63T0,3120,5440,from vegas here i'm not a resort's world
VyasSLF63T0,5440,6879,today and i'm not at the world series of
VyasSLF63T0,6879,9280,poker but instead at another one of my
VyasSLF63T0,9280,13400,favorite properties on the strip
VyasSLF63T0,13400,25148,[Music]
VyasSLF63T0,25199,26800,that's right this is the wind slash
VyasSLF63T0,26800,29439,encore property home to
VyasSLF63T0,29439,31439,probably one of the most popular poker
VyasSLF63T0,31439,33280,rooms in all of las vegas if not the
VyasSLF63T0,33280,35360,world and it's for good reason they have
VyasSLF63T0,35360,37920,really good staff the games are good uh
VyasSLF63T0,37920,40399,the property's super nice so i figured
VyasSLF63T0,40399,41760,why not spend the day here today and
VyasSLF63T0,41760,44320,play some 510. the game is uncapped
VyasSLF63T0,44320,46079,which is definitely a plus so i'm going
VyasSLF63T0,46079,47520,to be in for
VyasSLF63T0,47520,49760,some amount in the neighborhood of 10 or
VyasSLF63T0,49760,52000,20 000 and
VyasSLF63T0,52000,53360,as per usual we're going to see how it
VyasSLF63T0,53360,54800,goes now
VyasSLF63T0,54800,56640,this is probably the last video to come
VyasSLF63T0,56640,58960,out before this event which is the
VyasSLF63T0,58960,62000,meetup game on club gg june 30th it's
VyasSLF63T0,62000,64400,gonna be a one two no limit game so if
VyasSLF63T0,64400,65760,any of you guys are interested in
VyasSLF63T0,65760,67920,playing virtually alongside me this is
VyasSLF63T0,67920,69760,the time and place to do it and the
VyasSLF63T0,69760,72159,following day july 1st there's going to
VyasSLF63T0,72159,75040,be a 2 000 free roll tournament also on
VyasSLF63T0,75040,77119,club gg and the only way to qualify for
VyasSLF63T0,77119,78720,that tournament is to play the meetup
VyasSLF63T0,78720,81200,game the previous day so like i said if
VyasSLF63T0,81200,83200,any of that sounds appealing to you hit
VyasSLF63T0,83200,84640,the link in the description to sign up
VyasSLF63T0,84640,86640,it's pretty straightforward but anyways
VyasSLF63T0,86640,88880,until then let's jump into the poker
VyasSLF63T0,88880,90000,hands
VyasSLF63T0,90000,108640,[Music]
VyasSLF63T0,108640,110479,all right guys here we are underway at
VyasSLF63T0,110479,112479,the wind and we get some good news right
VyasSLF63T0,112479,114079,off the bat as the whole table decides
VyasSLF63T0,114079,118240,to play 5 10 20 instead of just 510 so
VyasSLF63T0,118240,120320,already off to a good start and not only
VyasSLF63T0,120320,121840,that but we all agree to start off the
VyasSLF63T0,121840,123920,night with a 500
VyasSLF63T0,123920,127439,plo flip meaning we each put in 500
VyasSLF63T0,127439,130319,get dealt four cards just like plo and
VyasSLF63T0,130319,132319,off we go to a flop to see who has the
VyasSLF63T0,132319,135200,winning hand at the end now clueless as
VyasSLF63T0,135200,136720,i am to this game
VyasSLF63T0,136720,138959,i announced my set of eights which turns
VyasSLF63T0,138959,140319,out to be good
VyasSLF63T0,140319,141920,and then eventually realize i have a
VyasSLF63T0,141920,143520,straight with queen jack not that it
VyasSLF63T0,143520,145280,makes any difference since i end up
VyasSLF63T0,145280,147599,winning this flip anyway but yeah just a
VyasSLF63T0,147599,149599,testament to how little i know what's
VyasSLF63T0,149599,152239,really going on in most omaha hands
VyasSLF63T0,152239,154560,either way off to a great start as we're
VyasSLF63T0,154560,157360,up around 25 or 3 000
VyasSLF63T0,157360,158879,something like that less than five
VyasSLF63T0,158879,160560,minutes after sitting down
VyasSLF63T0,160560,161840,but anyway enough of the crazy
VyasSLF63T0,161840,163920,shenanigans we move on to a normal hand
VyasSLF63T0,163920,165920,here where there's a button open to 70
VyasSLF63T0,165920,167519,the big blind calls and i'm in the
VyasSLF63T0,167519,170319,straddle with king queen typically i
VyasSLF63T0,170319,172239,think calling makes a little more sense
VyasSLF63T0,172239,173599,but this time i decide to play
VyasSLF63T0,173599,175360,aggressively also considering that
VyasSLF63T0,175360,176800,there's some dead money from the big
VyasSLF63T0,176800,179280,blind calling and play my hand in the
VyasSLF63T0,179280,181200,more adventurous fashion by raising it
VyasSLF63T0,181200,183360,up to 350 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,183360,184879,the button makes the call he's the
VyasSLF63T0,184879,187120,initial razor but the big blind folds so
VyasSLF63T0,187120,189440,heads up out of position to a flop of
VyasSLF63T0,189440,192239,ace king eight with two hearts so i've
VyasSLF63T0,192239,194000,got middle pair
VyasSLF63T0,194000,195760,mixed feelings about this one but i
VyasSLF63T0,195760,197120,think just betting small with all my
VyasSLF63T0,197120,198720,hands makes the most sense so that's
VyasSLF63T0,198720,201519,what i do and he makes the call it turns
VyasSLF63T0,201519,203360,the eight of clubs pairing the bottom
VyasSLF63T0,203360,206239,card this time i check it and he checks
VyasSLF63T0,206239,207200,it back
VyasSLF63T0,207200,209440,the river is the four of diamonds i
VyasSLF63T0,209440,211599,check it again hoping to get to showdown
VyasSLF63T0,211599,213280,but this time my opponent disagrees and
VyasSLF63T0,213280,214200,bets
VyasSLF63T0,214200,216400,730 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,216400,218480,given how the hands played out i think
VyasSLF63T0,218480,220879,he's most likely just got an ace that's
VyasSLF63T0,220879,222640,going for value
VyasSLF63T0,222640,224879,not sure how much i agree with that play
VyasSLF63T0,224879,227440,but as it stands i think my hand is not
VyasSLF63T0,227440,229840,necessarily strong enough to call and
VyasSLF63T0,229840,230640,win
VyasSLF63T0,230640,234000,really too often so instead i decide to
VyasSLF63T0,234000,236879,use this board and my hand as a check
VyasSLF63T0,236879,239120,raised bluff by making it
VyasSLF63T0,239120,242239,thousand three hundred dollars
VyasSLF63T0,242239,244560,not sure looking back how much i like
VyasSLF63T0,244560,247519,this play um especially having the queen
VyasSLF63T0,247519,249519,of hearts it makes it less likely he's
VyasSLF63T0,249519,252159,got a hand like a queen high flush draw
VyasSLF63T0,252159,254560,that's bluffing for example but
VyasSLF63T0,254560,256720,as played that's what i did and
VyasSLF63T0,256720,258400,unfortunately my opponent ends up
VyasSLF63T0,258400,262000,calling with ace nine of clubs
VyasSLF63T0,262000,263680,so yeah a little bit of an interesting
VyasSLF63T0,263680,264880,hand here
VyasSLF63T0,264880,266479,but like i said i don't really love the
VyasSLF63T0,266479,268400,way i played it and the result
VyasSLF63T0,268400,270639,definitely reflects that as we lose a
VyasSLF63T0,270639,273520,pretty big pot to start the night
VyasSLF63T0,273520,274880,let's see if we can turn things around
VyasSLF63T0,274880,276960,with eight seven of spades in this next
VyasSLF63T0,276960,279440,one there's a middle position open to 60
VyasSLF63T0,279440,281440,good mix here between calling or raising
VyasSLF63T0,281440,283280,this time i just call and the button
VyasSLF63T0,283280,285040,calls as well so three of us going to a
VyasSLF63T0,285040,287680,flop of 10 10 8.
VyasSLF63T0,287680,290479,initial razor checks i decide to bet 50
VyasSLF63T0,290479,292400,dollars though i think checking is fine
VyasSLF63T0,292400,293120,too
VyasSLF63T0,293120,295040,the button calls and the initial razor
VyasSLF63T0,295040,296800,calls as well so still three of us going
VyasSLF63T0,296800,299680,to return which is the ace of diamonds
VyasSLF63T0,299680,301520,not really a great card for me so this
VyasSLF63T0,301520,304240,time i check and the button checks back
VyasSLF63T0,304240,306160,and we go to a river which is the nine
VyasSLF63T0,306160,307520,of spades
VyasSLF63T0,307520,309919,initial razor checks again i check it as
VyasSLF63T0,309919,312800,well but now the button throws out 400
VyasSLF63T0,312800,313919,dollars
VyasSLF63T0,313919,315919,initial razer folds and now it's back on
VyasSLF63T0,315919,316960,me
VyasSLF63T0,316960,318960,this is definitely an interesting
VyasSLF63T0,318960,321280,situation because if he had a 10 i would
VyasSLF63T0,321280,323759,imagine he would bet the turn almost
VyasSLF63T0,323759,324960,always
VyasSLF63T0,324960,327120,and if he doesn't have a 10 why exactly
VyasSLF63T0,327120,329199,is he betting so big doesn't he want to
VyasSLF63T0,329199,331840,get called if he's got something good
VyasSLF63T0,331840,333039,so i don't know
VyasSLF63T0,333039,335039,i was a little bit curious it felt like
VyasSLF63T0,335039,336720,he could easily be trying to steal the
VyasSLF63T0,336720,339680,pot with some sort of miss draw what's
VyasSLF63T0,339680,341360,kind of weird is a lot of his draws
VyasSLF63T0,341360,343680,would improve to at least one pair when
VyasSLF63T0,343680,346160,the nine hits on the river
VyasSLF63T0,346160,348800,but as per usual when i'm curious about
VyasSLF63T0,348800,350880,what's going on and i think a decision
VyasSLF63T0,350880,353440,is close i tossed in the money
VyasSLF63T0,353440,355120,and this time that's the incorrect
VyasSLF63T0,355120,357120,decision as we end up losing to queen
VyasSLF63T0,357120,359919,jack so a rivered straight definitely
VyasSLF63T0,359919,362400,beats my measly pair of eights
VyasSLF63T0,362400,364479,and we lose another one
VyasSLF63T0,364479,366160,moving right along to the next one in
VyasSLF63T0,366160,367840,this one there's a late position open to
VyasSLF63T0,367840,370400,60 and i look down at ace queen on the
VyasSLF63T0,370400,371360,button
VyasSLF63T0,371360,374000,pretty good cards so i bump it up to 210
VyasSLF63T0,374000,374960,dollars
VyasSLF63T0,374960,377600,and get a cold call from the small blind
VyasSLF63T0,377600,379919,who's the same player from last hand and
VyasSLF63T0,379919,381680,the initial razer folds so not really
VyasSLF63T0,381680,383600,what i was expecting but that's alright
VyasSLF63T0,383600,385360,we're in position going to a flop of
VyasSLF63T0,385360,388160,king eight five rainbow
VyasSLF63T0,388160,389600,king high board looks like a good one
VyasSLF63T0,389600,391120,for me to continue betting so that's
VyasSLF63T0,391120,394000,what i do 140 dollars and he makes the
VyasSLF63T0,394000,394880,call
VyasSLF63T0,394880,396400,the turn change is nothing it's the
VyasSLF63T0,396400,398560,deuce of spades he checks again and i
VyasSLF63T0,398560,401120,think this time sizing up is a good idea
VyasSLF63T0,401120,403440,with all my hands whether it's good ones
VyasSLF63T0,403440,405360,or bad ones in this case
VyasSLF63T0,405360,407120,it's definitely not a good one but that
VyasSLF63T0,407120,408639,doesn't stop me from throwing out one
VyasSLF63T0,408639,410960,thousand dollars and after some thought
VyasSLF63T0,410960,413680,my opponent makes the call so definitely
VyasSLF63T0,413680,415599,looking for some help now
VyasSLF63T0,415599,417680,and i think we get it with the queen of
VyasSLF63T0,417680,420560,diamonds on the river he checks it again
VyasSLF63T0,420560,422560,and considering how the hands gone down
VyasSLF63T0,422560,424800,i think we're very likely up against
VyasSLF63T0,424800,426960,some sort of middling pocket pair
VyasSLF63T0,426960,429919,perhaps from nines up to jacks something
VyasSLF63T0,429919,431360,of that nature
VyasSLF63T0,431360,433919,sometimes he might have a king but
VyasSLF63T0,433919,435840,given that i have an ace and there's two
VyasSLF63T0,435840,437840,queens accounted for unless we're up
VyasSLF63T0,437840,440479,against king jack suited i don't really
VyasSLF63T0,440479,442880,think it's too likely so i decide to bet
VyasSLF63T0,442880,445120,really small for value now this is kind
VyasSLF63T0,445120,446960,of a disrespectful bet not something i
VyasSLF63T0,446960,448800,would do against an opponent that i
VyasSLF63T0,448800,451599,think could punish this sort of bet but
VyasSLF63T0,451599,453599,this guy isn't exactly that so i put in
VyasSLF63T0,453599,455039,800
VyasSLF63T0,455039,458160,and after not much thought he lets it go
VyasSLF63T0,458160,460639,still nice to take it down after losing
VyasSLF63T0,460639,462080,the last few hands
VyasSLF63T0,462080,464000,the very next shuffle there's a middle
VyasSLF63T0,464000,466400,position limp and i raise in late
VyasSLF63T0,466400,468960,position to 70 dollars with king eight
VyasSLF63T0,468960,471199,suited we see a call from the big blind
VyasSLF63T0,471199,472960,and the middle position limper so three
VyasSLF63T0,472960,475360,ways to a flop of seven six three with
VyasSLF63T0,475360,476720,one spade
VyasSLF63T0,476720,478400,not really a good board for me so when
VyasSLF63T0,478400,480639,it checks to me i check it back
VyasSLF63T0,480639,482479,and what do you know we make top pair on
VyasSLF63T0,482479,485199,the turn as the king of clubs arrives
VyasSLF63T0,485199,487039,this time it checks to me and i decide
VyasSLF63T0,487039,489199,to bet for value once again similar
VyasSLF63T0,489199,491440,situation to last hand this isn't really
VyasSLF63T0,491440,493919,recommended against opposition who can
VyasSLF63T0,493919,495360,punish you for
VyasSLF63T0,495360,496960,betting a hand that only looks like one
VyasSLF63T0,496960,499360,pair on a board like this but
VyasSLF63T0,499360,500639,these guys
VyasSLF63T0,500639,502639,in this particular table i wasn't too
VyasSLF63T0,502639,504560,worried about that happening so i throw
VyasSLF63T0,504560,506720,out hundred and twenty dollars
VyasSLF63T0,506720,508720,big blind makes the call middle position
VyasSLF63T0,508720,510560,folds and we go heads up to a river
VyasSLF63T0,510560,512880,which is the five of diamonds meaning
VyasSLF63T0,512880,515518,any four now makes a straight
VyasSLF63T0,515518,518320,she checks again and as ambitious as it
VyasSLF63T0,518320,520959,may seem i think we can put in another
VyasSLF63T0,520959,523200,bet try to make it look like a bluff and
VyasSLF63T0,523200,525839,perhaps get hero called by a seven or a
VyasSLF63T0,525839,527519,non-believing six
VyasSLF63T0,527519,529120,sure sometimes we'll get called by a
VyasSLF63T0,529120,530720,better hand but
VyasSLF63T0,530720,533279,i'm okay with that so i put in 470
VyasSLF63T0,533279,534560,dollars
VyasSLF63T0,534560,537839,and after a few moments she decides to
VyasSLF63T0,537839,540399,check raise to some amount
VyasSLF63T0,540399,542640,i fold right away and she's kind enough
VyasSLF63T0,542640,545920,to show me king four of diamonds so
VyasSLF63T0,545920,548959,we were in okay shape but uh straight on
VyasSLF63T0,548959,552240,the river it's gonna get it done
VyasSLF63T0,552560,553680,in the next one there's an early
VyasSLF63T0,553680,555760,position open to sixty dollars and i
VyasSLF63T0,555760,557519,make it two hundred and ten dollars in
VyasSLF63T0,557519,560000,late position with king jack off suit
VyasSLF63T0,560000,561279,not really a hand that's strong enough
VyasSLF63T0,561279,563120,to call so i think pretty much folding
VyasSLF63T0,563120,564720,every time is fine
VyasSLF63T0,564720,567279,and once in a while putting in the raise
VyasSLF63T0,567279,569440,as a bluff so that's what i do this time
VyasSLF63T0,569440,571200,and my opponent makes the call
VyasSLF63T0,571200,573360,we go heads up to a flop of five deuce
VyasSLF63T0,573360,574320,deuce
VyasSLF63T0,574320,576160,pretty dry board usually one that i'm
VyasSLF63T0,576160,577920,gonna have a big advantage on so when he
VyasSLF63T0,577920,580080,checks i continue betting and he makes
VyasSLF63T0,580080,581120,the call
VyasSLF63T0,581120,583760,the turn is magical it's the jack of
VyasSLF63T0,583760,586560,hearts giving me a very disguised strong
VyasSLF63T0,586560,589120,top pair so when he checks i'm happy to
VyasSLF63T0,589120,591040,put in another over bet just like the
VyasSLF63T0,591040,593200,hand where i had ace queen except this
VyasSLF63T0,593200,595040,time i've got something so that's always
VyasSLF63T0,595040,597760,nice i throw out one thousand dollars
VyasSLF63T0,597760,601360,and after much thinking he decides to
VyasSLF63T0,601360,604560,call so things are looking up here until
VyasSLF63T0,604560,607600,the river comes the ace of clubs now i
VyasSLF63T0,607600,609839,don't necessarily think he has an ace in
VyasSLF63T0,609839,612320,fact i think it's very unlikely he's got
VyasSLF63T0,612320,614079,one but the reason this card sucks so
VyasSLF63T0,614079,616160,much is now it's very impossible to get
VyasSLF63T0,616160,618720,more value from hands like pocket tens
VyasSLF63T0,618720,622320,or nines or eights you guys get the idea
VyasSLF63T0,622320,625040,so when he checks it a third time after
VyasSLF63T0,625040,627839,some thought i decide to just check it
VyasSLF63T0,627839,629440,back i guess
VyasSLF63T0,629440,631200,and we end up winning against pocket
VyasSLF63T0,631200,632399,tens
VyasSLF63T0,632399,634800,could have gone for some value there but
VyasSLF63T0,634800,636800,whatever we win anyway
VyasSLF63T0,636800,638399,and that brings us to the next hand
VyasSLF63T0,638399,640240,where once again we've got king jack off
VyasSLF63T0,640240,642800,suit this time i opened a 50 and only
VyasSLF63T0,642800,644399,the big blind calls
VyasSLF63T0,644399,646480,and what do you know we finally get an
VyasSLF63T0,646480,650959,amazing flop today it's queen 10 9 with
VyasSLF63T0,650959,652720,two diamonds that's right we flopped the
VyasSLF63T0,652720,654160,stone cold nuts
VyasSLF63T0,654160,656320,with the king of diamonds as a backup
VyasSLF63T0,656320,659360,plan she checks i bet 60 and i'm happy
VyasSLF63T0,659360,660959,to see she makes the call
VyasSLF63T0,660959,662880,turns the deuce of hearts she checks
VyasSLF63T0,662880,665200,again and this time i decide to size up
VyasSLF63T0,665200,667200,thinking she could have a queen or any
VyasSLF63T0,667200,669040,sort of draw she's probably not going to
VyasSLF63T0,669040,672000,fold those hands so i toss in 300
VyasSLF63T0,672000,674959,and sure enough she does make the call
VyasSLF63T0,674959,676560,once again though we get a disappointing
VyasSLF63T0,676560,679279,river as the king of hearts comes out
VyasSLF63T0,679279,681120,not necessarily expecting her to have a
VyasSLF63T0,681120,683360,jack too often but once again it's tough
VyasSLF63T0,683360,685040,to get value from worse so this time
VyasSLF63T0,685040,687040,when she checks i size down a little bit
VyasSLF63T0,687040,689200,to 330 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,689200,690880,no small chunk of change but you know
VyasSLF63T0,690880,692480,relative to the pot
VyasSLF63T0,692480,694560,and after some thought she does make the
VyasSLF63T0,694560,696720,call so i turn it over and we end up
VyasSLF63T0,696720,699200,winning versus king queen of spades so
VyasSLF63T0,699200,701760,quite the fortunate situation there
VyasSLF63T0,701760,703920,and the next one i have ace 10 off suit
VyasSLF63T0,703920,706160,on the button i raise it up to 50
VyasSLF63T0,706160,708480,and only the straddler makes the call so
VyasSLF63T0,708480,710320,two of us going to a flop which is a
VyasSLF63T0,710320,713120,good one it's ace seven three with two
VyasSLF63T0,713120,716000,hearts he checks i bet small and
VyasSLF63T0,716000,718880,surprisingly he check raises but he also
VyasSLF63T0,718880,720880,chooses a small sizing it's only 70
VyasSLF63T0,720880,721920,dollars
VyasSLF63T0,721920,723519,not sure what to make of this but i
VyasSLF63T0,723519,725680,throw in the 40 more and we see the six
VyasSLF63T0,725680,727360,of hearts on the turn
VyasSLF63T0,727360,729680,this time he slows down and checks it
VyasSLF63T0,729680,731680,and now i think betting small with
VyasSLF63T0,731680,733279,pretty much all my hands is the way to
VyasSLF63T0,733279,736240,go including top pair with a semi-weak
VyasSLF63T0,736240,738880,flush draw i know it might seem a little
VyasSLF63T0,738880,741120,bit weird to do this but anyway i put in
VyasSLF63T0,741120,742320,the 80
VyasSLF63T0,742320,744320,and he makes the call so i think we
VyasSLF63T0,744320,745680,still have the best hand and when the
VyasSLF63T0,745680,747920,river comes the six of clubs i shouldn't
VyasSLF63T0,747920,750320,really change much so when he checks it
VyasSLF63T0,750320,752320,i decided to go for some more value it's
VyasSLF63T0,752320,754240,pretty thin considering that he check
VyasSLF63T0,754240,755760,raised on the flop
VyasSLF63T0,755760,758160,and called a bet on the turn not really
VyasSLF63T0,758160,760079,sure what worst hands we can target here
VyasSLF63T0,760079,762240,but i think smaller aces are going to
VyasSLF63T0,762240,764240,pay off a small size so that's what i
VyasSLF63T0,764240,767519,like to do throwing in 130 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,767519,769200,and sure enough my opponent tosses in
VyasSLF63T0,769200,771440,the call and my opponent flashes us the
VyasSLF63T0,771440,773360,ace of diamonds so that one works out
VyasSLF63T0,773360,774480,nicely
VyasSLF63T0,774480,776639,and we move right along to the following
VyasSLF63T0,776639,778720,hand where there's a small blind open to
VyasSLF63T0,778720,780880,sixty dollars and i'm in the big blind
VyasSLF63T0,780880,783040,with pocket sevens
VyasSLF63T0,783040,785120,could call could raise this time i
VyasSLF63T0,785120,786959,choose the more fun option and make it
VyasSLF63T0,786959,788800,220 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,788800,791200,straddler folds on my left and now the
VyasSLF63T0,791200,793120,small blind decides
VyasSLF63T0,793120,795120,that he wants to raise again as well
VyasSLF63T0,795120,797760,making it one thousand dollars to go
VyasSLF63T0,797760,799519,now with my hand we could go either way
VyasSLF63T0,799519,801440,between seeing a flop in position or
VyasSLF63T0,801440,803760,just letting it go but for some reason i
VyasSLF63T0,803760,805680,was catching a vibe that this guy had a
VyasSLF63T0,805680,808160,hand like ace king or you know some big
VyasSLF63T0,808160,809200,cards
VyasSLF63T0,809200,811279,so i proceed with the call and we go to
VyasSLF63T0,811279,815200,a flop of jack 10 5 rainbow he bets 400
VyasSLF63T0,815200,817360,dollars around one fifth the size of the
VyasSLF63T0,817360,819519,pot considering that we still be ace
VyasSLF63T0,819519,821600,highs i make the call and we see the
VyasSLF63T0,821600,824240,nine of spades on the turn this time he
VyasSLF63T0,824240,826800,checks and i check it back
VyasSLF63T0,826800,828560,and what do you know we make a straight
VyasSLF63T0,828560,831040,on the river with the eight of diamonds
VyasSLF63T0,831040,832720,my opponent checks it
VyasSLF63T0,832720,835040,an unexpected strong hand appearing out
VyasSLF63T0,835040,837120,of nowhere for myself obviously we still
VyasSLF63T0,837120,839600,lose to any queen but after he checks it
VyasSLF63T0,839600,840959,a second time
VyasSLF63T0,840959,842639,i don't think it's very likely he's got
VyasSLF63T0,842639,844720,one um i guess he could have a hand like
VyasSLF63T0,844720,846399,ace queen and he's planning to check
VyasSLF63T0,846399,848320,raise but i doubt he would do that when
VyasSLF63T0,848320,849920,it doesn't really look like i would have
VyasSLF63T0,849920,851600,a hand that's gonna bet
VyasSLF63T0,851600,853680,i decided that's small i don't really
VyasSLF63T0,853680,855199,expect to get called by worse but who
VyasSLF63T0,855199,856720,knows maybe i was wrong and he does have
VyasSLF63T0,856720,859199,a hand like pocket aces so i put in nine
VyasSLF63T0,859199,861680,hundred dollars but after a few seconds
VyasSLF63T0,861680,863920,he gets out of the way and did later
VyasSLF63T0,863920,866000,tell me he had ace king so
VyasSLF63T0,866000,868560,again another good result with a
VyasSLF63T0,868560,870959,semi mediocre hand
VyasSLF63T0,870959,872560,and that ladies and gentlemen brings us
VyasSLF63T0,872560,874639,to the last hand of the night there's a
VyasSLF63T0,874639,876880,late position open to 60 dollars and i'm
VyasSLF63T0,876880,879279,on the button with ace eight of hearts
VyasSLF63T0,879279,881279,again a hand that i think it's okay to
VyasSLF63T0,881279,884000,call or raise with this time i raise it
VyasSLF63T0,884000,886639,up making it 220 dollars
VyasSLF63T0,886639,888160,and my opponent makes a call so we go
VyasSLF63T0,888160,891040,heads up to a flop of queen six six two
VyasSLF63T0,891040,894000,spades one club not much going on for me
VyasSLF63T0,894000,896480,but i decide to bet small anyway think
VyasSLF63T0,896480,898160,doing this with all my hands makes sense
VyasSLF63T0,898160,899600,and who knows we might even get a fold
VyasSLF63T0,899600,901839,from a better ace high for example or
VyasSLF63T0,901839,903600,maybe a small pocket pair
VyasSLF63T0,903600,905279,no such luck though as my opponent makes
VyasSLF63T0,905279,907519,the call and we see another queen on the
VyasSLF63T0,907519,909680,turn definitely not looking to continue
VyasSLF63T0,909680,911440,bluffing on this card so when he checks
VyasSLF63T0,911440,913760,it i check it back and we see the eight
VyasSLF63T0,913760,915760,of diamonds on the river
VyasSLF63T0,915760,918000,once again though my opponent checks i
VyasSLF63T0,918000,920639,think this might be some sort of bait
VyasSLF63T0,920639,922720,don't really expect to get folds on a
VyasSLF63T0,922720,924639,board like this anyway so i check it
VyasSLF63T0,924639,926880,back right away and sure enough we end
VyasSLF63T0,926880,930079,up losing to queen jack of hearts
VyasSLF63T0,930079,931680,nice hand man
VyasSLF63T0,931680,934240,anyway that was the end of the session
VyasSLF63T0,934240,936959,not a ton of action this time but still
VyasSLF63T0,936959,939519,some fun hands and as always i hope you
VyasSLF63T0,939519,941350,guys enjoyed the hands

VyasSLF63T0,951440,954639,okay so good news and bad news the bad
VyasSLF63T0,954639,957440,news is i ended up losing around
VyasSLF63T0,957440,959279,thirteen or fourteen hundred dollars
VyasSLF63T0,959279,960160,over
VyasSLF63T0,960160,961920,the course of seven
VyasSLF63T0,961920,965839,very boring hours at the win 510 tables

VyasSLF63T0,980000,982240,lot better about that money lost but
VyasSLF63T0,982240,984480,anyway that's the conclusion of today's
VyasSLF63T0,984480,986240,session
VyasSLF63T0,986240,988399,not very exciting
VyasSLF63T0,988399,991360,not anything really worth mentioning
VyasSLF63T0,991360,992079,but
VyasSLF63T0,992079,994320,that's how it goes sometimes and you
