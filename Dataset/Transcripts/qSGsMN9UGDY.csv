qSGsMN9UGDY,240,1600,- Three years.
qSGsMN9UGDY,1600,5750,It was three long years ago that I first laid eyes
qSGsMN9UGDY,5750,9160,on the technology that would put OLED in its place.
qSGsMN9UGDY,9160,10590,And I've waited since then
qSGsMN9UGDY,10590,14660,for what would eventually become the Hisense U9DG.
qSGsMN9UGDY,16730,19610,This is no normal TV
qSGsMN9UGDY,19610,22560,instead of one LCD panel filtering the white back light
qSGsMN9UGDY,22560,26300,turning it into the vibrant content that you enjoy.
qSGsMN9UGDY,26300,30480,The U9DG has two LCD panels.
qSGsMN9UGDY,30480,33559,"In theory, this unique design gives it the best"
qSGsMN9UGDY,33560,38060,of all worlds near perfect blacks like an OLED
qSGsMN9UGDY,38060,41980,and vibrant peak brightness for the best possible
qSGsMN9UGDY,41980,44250,home HDR experience.
qSGsMN9UGDY,44250,49250,And it's already discontinued that's terrific.
qSGsMN9UGDY,54530,57969,because it means that you might be able
qSGsMN9UGDY,57970,60970,"to score a deal on the remaining stock,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,60970,63020,"which appears to be now on clearance,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,63020,65770,making this video interesting for two reasons.
qSGsMN9UGDY,65770,68840,"First, to get deep under the hood of a display tech"
qSGsMN9UGDY,68840,70427,the world may never see again
qSGsMN9UGDY,70428,75320,and second to maybe score a deal perhaps.
qSGsMN9UGDY,75320,78228,Oh and a third to learn about our sponsor
qSGsMN9UGDY,78228,79061,- GlassWire.
qSGsMN9UGDY,79061,80960,Thanks to GlassWire for sponsoring this video.

qSGsMN9UGDY,92780,94770,- The big problem with displaying HDR content
qSGsMN9UGDY,94770,97250,on LCDs is that even the best ones
qSGsMN9UGDY,97250,99760,can't fully block out the back light behind them
qSGsMN9UGDY,99760,103620,making black look like more of a faded out gray.
qSGsMN9UGDY,103620,106100,And the solution (mumbles) has been to divide
qSGsMN9UGDY,106100,107180,up the back light
qSGsMN9UGDY,107180,110170,into multiple zones that can be individually controlled
qSGsMN9UGDY,110170,112360,to darken or brighten the image
qSGsMN9UGDY,112360,114460,depending on the content in front.
qSGsMN9UGDY,114460,118670,"This works okay, but even on many LED TVs"
qSGsMN9UGDY,118670,121100,"with a thousand plus dimming zones,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,121100,124490,the bloom or halo effect around bright objects
qSGsMN9UGDY,124490,127310,is almost always visible to the naked eye.
qSGsMN9UGDY,127310,132150,"But what if you had 2,000,000 local dimming zones?"
qSGsMN9UGDY,132150,135239,"This one doesn't, it's only got 132,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,135240,140240,but in front of those dimming zones is a 1080p IPS
qSGsMN9UGDY,140600,145280,black and white LCD panel that acts has a light filter.
qSGsMN9UGDY,145280,149970,And then in front of that is a 4K IPS color panel
qSGsMN9UGDY,149970,152490,to output our final 75 inch image
qSGsMN9UGDY,152490,155350,at refresh rates of up to 120 Hertz.
qSGsMN9UGDY,155350,157060,Doesn't that add a lot more cost
qSGsMN9UGDY,157060,159680,"and complexity you might ask, yes."
qSGsMN9UGDY,159680,161090,"For everything packed into it,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,161090,163680,the U9DG is impressively slim
qSGsMN9UGDY,163680,166129,but Hisense says that the bonding process
qSGsMN9UGDY,166130,167840,to fuse the panels together
qSGsMN9UGDY,167840,170330,was extremely difficult to perfect.
qSGsMN9UGDY,170330,171710,And it clearly contributes
qSGsMN9UGDY,171710,174480,to the shocking 42 kilogram curb weight
qSGsMN9UGDY,174480,177411,that resulted in our first sample being damaged in shipping.
qSGsMN9UGDY,177411,181090,The good news is that it took years
qSGsMN9UGDY,181090,182800,but it was worth the wait.
qSGsMN9UGDY,182800,186580,The two panel solution gives us an unbelievable amount
qSGsMN9UGDY,186580,188540,of dynamic range on an LCD.
qSGsMN9UGDY,188540,191769,"I mean, these are nearly OLED like blacks,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,191770,196460,less than 0.01 nits and it still reaches as high
qSGsMN9UGDY,196460,200320,as roughly 1100 nits in a 5% window.
qSGsMN9UGDY,200320,204070,And the best part is the fineness of that control.
qSGsMN9UGDY,204070,205630,The 1080 monochrome panel
qSGsMN9UGDY,205630,209280,doesn't quite match the resolution of the 4K colored one
qSGsMN9UGDY,209280,212230,but if you need a pinhole of light in the darkness
qSGsMN9UGDY,212230,214640,it'll block most of the back light strength
qSGsMN9UGDY,214640,217080,before it ever reaches the color panel.
qSGsMN9UGDY,217080,220200,"And with over 2,000,000 effective dimming zones"
qSGsMN9UGDY,220200,223030,the halo effect is nearly imperceptible
qSGsMN9UGDY,223030,226030,unless you put your eyeball to the glass.
qSGsMN9UGDY,226030,228480,For reference we compared the U9DG
qSGsMN9UGDY,228480,232000,to a cheaper OLED and a nicer Mini LED.
qSGsMN9UGDY,232000,234930,And even though the Mini LED had a whopping thousand zones
qSGsMN9UGDY,234930,238400,of local dimming on a smaller 65 inch panel
qSGsMN9UGDY,238400,241340,the 75 inch Hisense was hands down
qSGsMN9UGDY,241340,243870,the best performer for HDR content.
qSGsMN9UGDY,243870,246319,Did I even mention yet that it has a quantum.film
qSGsMN9UGDY,246320,248040,and supports Dolby Vision?
qSGsMN9UGDY,248040,250900,So unless you're in a light controlled environment
qSGsMN9UGDY,250900,255409,"where the OLED really shines, it's just wow."
qSGsMN9UGDY,255410,257600,And the U9DG is pretty color accurate too
qSGsMN9UGDY,257600,261430,giving us an average LTE of 5.1 and IMAX HDR
qSGsMN9UGDY,261430,264840,"and just 2.3 in SDR Filmmaker mode,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,264840,268380,"similar to our LG Mini LED and way ahead of our (mumbles),"
qSGsMN9UGDY,268380,271130,though it too is still pretty respectable
qSGsMN9UGDY,271130,272910,for a home display.
qSGsMN9UGDY,272910,274590,A quick note for the Hisense though
qSGsMN9UGDY,274590,276410,if you want to get this crazy dynamic range
qSGsMN9UGDY,276410,278130,while maintaining color accuracy
qSGsMN9UGDY,278130,281200,you'll want to use IMAX mode with local dimming set to high.
qSGsMN9UGDY,281200,282150,"Now, at this point,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,282150,284770,everything is proceeded as I had foreseen
qSGsMN9UGDY,284770,288680,"but my big question for Hisense from day one has been,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,288680,291130,isn't this going to add a bunch of processing delay
qSGsMN9UGDY,291130,294290,and totally (mumbles) the gaming experience.
qSGsMN9UGDY,294290,296940,To find out we had to hook it up.
qSGsMN9UGDY,296940,299620,"Along with ethernet, USB, RCA, a headphone jack"
qSGsMN9UGDY,299620,301699,"and optical output, the IO was solid"
qSGsMN9UGDY,301700,304840,"with two HDMI 2.1 ports, one with eARC"
qSGsMN9UGDY,304840,307500,and the U9DG supports variable refresh rate
qSGsMN9UGDY,307500,308760,"with (mumbles) free sync,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,308760,311060,as well as automatic low latency mode
qSGsMN9UGDY,311060,314011,which should kick in with any supported input device.
qSGsMN9UGDY,314011,315930,That's promising for gaming.
qSGsMN9UGDY,315930,318289,But unless the pixel response times
qSGsMN9UGDY,318290,321320,of the two panels are darn near identical
qSGsMN9UGDY,321320,324660,you could end up with some really weird motion artifacts.
qSGsMN9UGDY,324660,326600,"Now, Hisense says they solved this,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,326600,329880,getting both of them to a matching eight milliseconds
qSGsMN9UGDY,329880,331690,but keeping them synced up
qSGsMN9UGDY,331690,333470,does require some extra work
qSGsMN9UGDY,333470,335600,courtesy of their capable SoC
qSGsMN9UGDY,335600,338640,with T-Con or timing controller.
qSGsMN9UGDY,338640,341300,We used an (mumbles) with an RTX 3080
qSGsMN9UGDY,341300,343789,on our three TVs to test latency.
qSGsMN9UGDY,343790,348790,And unfortunately the Hisense does indeed lose handily
qSGsMN9UGDY,349210,350460,to the competition.
qSGsMN9UGDY,350460,352009,It's not the worst we've seen
qSGsMN9UGDY,352010,353960,and they were at least upfront about it.
qSGsMN9UGDY,353960,356009,Eight milliseconds on the box should tell you
qSGsMN9UGDY,356010,359060,that there'll be noticeable ghosting or motion blur.
qSGsMN9UGDY,359060,361630,"But as long as the scene, isn't moving too fast"
qSGsMN9UGDY,361630,364150,your games will look gorgeous
qSGsMN9UGDY,364150,367060,like our new towels at lttstore.com.
qSGsMN9UGDY,367060,369540,"At this point, some of you must be wondering"
qSGsMN9UGDY,369540,371720,if this performs as well as it does
qSGsMN9UGDY,371720,374570,then why is this the only TV on the market
qSGsMN9UGDY,374570,376230,using this two panel tech
qSGsMN9UGDY,376230,379640,and why is it already discontinued?
qSGsMN9UGDY,379640,380850,"Well, first of all"
qSGsMN9UGDY,380850,384680,"this TV is relatively new, but the technology isn't"
qSGsMN9UGDY,384680,386490,and there's a commercial mastering monitor
qSGsMN9UGDY,386490,389110,from Sony that actually uses the same idea.
qSGsMN9UGDY,389110,391750,"The BVM-HX310,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,391750,396270,"it came out in 2019 and cost a whopping $30,000"
qSGsMN9UGDY,396270,398060,at launch keeping it firmly in the hands
qSGsMN9UGDY,398060,401240,"of the Hollywood elite, kind of like Chris Rock's face."
qSGsMN9UGDY,401240,404650,It can also do a thousand nits full screen
qSGsMN9UGDY,404650,408280,and it has insane color accuracy for film colorists.
qSGsMN9UGDY,408280,410220,"By contrast, pun intended"
qSGsMN9UGDY,410220,413960,the U9DG was always intended to undercut OLED
qSGsMN9UGDY,413960,415460,for the consumer market.
qSGsMN9UGDY,415460,418733,And it launched at just $3 to $3.5 thousand.
qSGsMN9UGDY,419660,422010,That's roughly a 10th of the price
qSGsMN9UGDY,422010,423880,"but now, mere months later"
qSGsMN9UGDY,423880,427070,you can already find it for just two grand at best buy.
qSGsMN9UGDY,427070,430060,"Thanks to strong competition, both from Mini LED"
qSGsMN9UGDY,430060,433080,and new OLED from both LG and Samsung
qSGsMN9UGDY,434200,435820,as for why they're not being made anymore.
qSGsMN9UGDY,435820,438640,Our best guess is that it's due to production complexity
qSGsMN9UGDY,438640,441120,and a competitive landscape that looks dramatically
qSGsMN9UGDY,441120,443370,different today than it did three years ago.
qSGsMN9UGDY,443370,445570,When I first saw this demonstrated.
qSGsMN9UGDY,445570,448140,So with Sony's mastering display being forever
qSGsMN9UGDY,448140,449880,out of reach of the general public
qSGsMN9UGDY,449880,453070,and dual panel tech off of Hisense public roadmap
qSGsMN9UGDY,453070,455610,the U9DG might make more sense
qSGsMN9UGDY,455610,458425,in a tech museum than it does in your living room.
qSGsMN9UGDY,458425,461569,But if you can find it for a clearance price
qSGsMN9UGDY,461570,465370,"and you need a huge TV, mostly for movies with a little bit"
qSGsMN9UGDY,465370,469050,"of light gaming, it's actually a pretty solid choice."
qSGsMN9UGDY,469050,471360,"And the builtin Google assistant, Chromecast"
qSGsMN9UGDY,471360,474770,"and Alexa are all nice bonuses,"

qSGsMN9UGDY,149970,152490,to output our final 75 inch image
qSGsMN9UGDY,152490,155350,at refresh rates of up to 120 Hertz.
qSGsMN9UGDY,155350,157060,Doesn't that add a lot more cost
qSGsMN9UGDY,157060,159680,"and complexity you might ask, yes."
qSGsMN9UGDY,159680,161090,"For everything packed into it,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,161090,163680,the U9DG is impressively slim
qSGsMN9UGDY,163680,166129,but Hisense says that the bonding process
qSGsMN9UGDY,166130,167840,to fuse the panels together
qSGsMN9UGDY,167840,170330,was extremely difficult to perfect.
qSGsMN9UGDY,170330,171710,And it clearly contributes
qSGsMN9UGDY,171710,174480,to the shocking 42 kilogram curb weight
qSGsMN9UGDY,174480,177411,that resulted in our first sample being damaged in shipping.
qSGsMN9UGDY,177411,181090,The good news is that it took years
qSGsMN9UGDY,181090,182800,but it was worth the wait.
qSGsMN9UGDY,182800,186580,The two panel solution gives us an unbelievable amount
qSGsMN9UGDY,186580,188540,of dynamic range on an LCD.
qSGsMN9UGDY,188540,191769,"I mean, these are nearly OLED like blacks,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,191770,196460,less than 0.01 nits and it still reaches as high
qSGsMN9UGDY,196460,200320,as roughly 1100 nits in a 5% window.
qSGsMN9UGDY,200320,204070,And the best part is the fineness of that control.
qSGsMN9UGDY,204070,205630,The 1080 monochrome panel
qSGsMN9UGDY,205630,209280,doesn't quite match the resolution of the 4K colored one
qSGsMN9UGDY,209280,212230,but if you need a pinhole of light in the darkness
qSGsMN9UGDY,212230,214640,it'll block most of the back light strength
qSGsMN9UGDY,214640,217080,before it ever reaches the color panel.
qSGsMN9UGDY,217080,220200,"And with over 2,000,000 effective dimming zones"
qSGsMN9UGDY,220200,223030,the halo effect is nearly imperceptible
qSGsMN9UGDY,223030,226030,unless you put your eyeball to the glass.
qSGsMN9UGDY,226030,228480,For reference we compared the U9DG
qSGsMN9UGDY,228480,232000,to a cheaper OLED and a nicer Mini LED.
qSGsMN9UGDY,232000,234930,And even though the Mini LED had a whopping thousand zones
qSGsMN9UGDY,234930,238400,of local dimming on a smaller 65 inch panel
qSGsMN9UGDY,238400,241340,the 75 inch Hisense was hands down
qSGsMN9UGDY,241340,243870,the best performer for HDR content.
qSGsMN9UGDY,243870,246319,Did I even mention yet that it has a quantum.film
qSGsMN9UGDY,246320,248040,and supports Dolby Vision?
qSGsMN9UGDY,248040,250900,So unless you're in a light controlled environment
qSGsMN9UGDY,250900,255409,"where the OLED really shines, it's just wow."
qSGsMN9UGDY,255410,257600,And the U9DG is pretty color accurate too
qSGsMN9UGDY,257600,261430,giving us an average LTE of 5.1 and IMAX HDR
qSGsMN9UGDY,261430,264840,"and just 2.3 in SDR Filmmaker mode,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,264840,268380,"similar to our LG Mini LED and way ahead of our (mumbles),"
qSGsMN9UGDY,268380,271130,though it too is still pretty respectable
qSGsMN9UGDY,271130,272910,for a home display.
qSGsMN9UGDY,272910,274590,A quick note for the Hisense though
qSGsMN9UGDY,274590,276410,if you want to get this crazy dynamic range
qSGsMN9UGDY,276410,278130,while maintaining color accuracy
qSGsMN9UGDY,278130,281200,you'll want to use IMAX mode with local dimming set to high.
qSGsMN9UGDY,281200,282150,"Now, at this point,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,282150,284770,everything is proceeded as I had foreseen
qSGsMN9UGDY,284770,288680,"but my big question for Hisense from day one has been,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,288680,291130,isn't this going to add a bunch of processing delay
qSGsMN9UGDY,291130,294290,and totally (mumbles) the gaming experience.
qSGsMN9UGDY,294290,296940,To find out we had to hook it up.
qSGsMN9UGDY,296940,299620,"Along with ethernet, USB, RCA, a headphone jack"
qSGsMN9UGDY,299620,301699,"and optical output, the IO was solid"
qSGsMN9UGDY,301700,304840,"with two HDMI 2.1 ports, one with eARC"
qSGsMN9UGDY,304840,307500,and the U9DG supports variable refresh rate
qSGsMN9UGDY,307500,308760,"with (mumbles) free sync,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,308760,311060,as well as automatic low latency mode
qSGsMN9UGDY,311060,314011,which should kick in with any supported input device.
qSGsMN9UGDY,314011,315930,That's promising for gaming.
qSGsMN9UGDY,315930,318289,But unless the pixel response times
qSGsMN9UGDY,318290,321320,of the two panels are darn near identical
qSGsMN9UGDY,321320,324660,you could end up with some really weird motion artifacts.
qSGsMN9UGDY,324660,326600,"Now, Hisense says they solved this,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,326600,329880,getting both of them to a matching eight milliseconds
qSGsMN9UGDY,329880,331690,but keeping them synced up
qSGsMN9UGDY,331690,333470,does require some extra work
qSGsMN9UGDY,333470,335600,courtesy of their capable SoC
qSGsMN9UGDY,335600,338640,with T-Con or timing controller.
qSGsMN9UGDY,338640,341300,We used an (mumbles) with an RTX 3080
qSGsMN9UGDY,341300,343789,on our three TVs to test latency.
qSGsMN9UGDY,343790,348790,And unfortunately the Hisense does indeed lose handily
qSGsMN9UGDY,349210,350460,to the competition.
qSGsMN9UGDY,350460,352009,It's not the worst we've seen
qSGsMN9UGDY,352010,353960,and they were at least upfront about it.
qSGsMN9UGDY,353960,356009,Eight milliseconds on the box should tell you
qSGsMN9UGDY,356010,359060,that there'll be noticeable ghosting or motion blur.
qSGsMN9UGDY,359060,361630,"But as long as the scene, isn't moving too fast"
qSGsMN9UGDY,361630,364150,your games will look gorgeous
qSGsMN9UGDY,364150,367060,like our new towels at lttstore.com.
qSGsMN9UGDY,367060,369540,"At this point, some of you must be wondering"
qSGsMN9UGDY,369540,371720,if this performs as well as it does
qSGsMN9UGDY,371720,374570,then why is this the only TV on the market
qSGsMN9UGDY,374570,376230,using this two panel tech
qSGsMN9UGDY,376230,379640,and why is it already discontinued?
qSGsMN9UGDY,379640,380850,"Well, first of all"
qSGsMN9UGDY,380850,384680,"this TV is relatively new, but the technology isn't"
qSGsMN9UGDY,384680,386490,and there's a commercial mastering monitor
qSGsMN9UGDY,386490,389110,from Sony that actually uses the same idea.
qSGsMN9UGDY,389110,391750,"The BVM-HX310,"
qSGsMN9UGDY,391750,396270,"it came out in 2019 and cost a whopping $30,000"
qSGsMN9UGDY,396270,398060,at launch keeping it firmly in the hands
qSGsMN9UGDY,398060,401240,"of the Hollywood elite, kind of like Chris Rock's face."
qSGsMN9UGDY,401240,404650,It can also do a thousand nits full screen
qSGsMN9UGDY,404650,408280,and it has insane color accuracy for film colorists.
qSGsMN9UGDY,408280,410220,"By contrast, pun intended"
qSGsMN9UGDY,410220,413960,the U9DG was always intended to undercut OLED
qSGsMN9UGDY,413960,415460,for the consumer market.
qSGsMN9UGDY,415460,418733,And it launched at just $3 to $3.5 thousand.
qSGsMN9UGDY,419660,422010,That's roughly a 10th of the price
qSGsMN9UGDY,422010,423880,"but now, mere months later"
qSGsMN9UGDY,423880,427070,you can already find it for just two grand at best buy.
qSGsMN9UGDY,427070,430060,"Thanks to strong competition, both from Mini LED"
qSGsMN9UGDY,430060,433080,and new OLED from both LG and Samsung
qSGsMN9UGDY,434200,435820,as for why they're not being made anymore.
qSGsMN9UGDY,435820,438640,Our best guess is that it's due to production complexity
qSGsMN9UGDY,438640,441120,and a competitive landscape that looks dramatically
qSGsMN9UGDY,441120,443370,different today than it did three years ago.
qSGsMN9UGDY,443370,445570,When I first saw this demonstrated.
qSGsMN9UGDY,445570,448140,So with Sony's mastering display being forever
qSGsMN9UGDY,448140,449880,out of reach of the general public
qSGsMN9UGDY,449880,453070,and dual panel tech off of Hisense public roadmap
qSGsMN9UGDY,453070,455610,the U9DG might make more sense
qSGsMN9UGDY,455610,458425,in a tech museum than it does in your living room.
qSGsMN9UGDY,458425,461569,But if you can find it for a clearance price
qSGsMN9UGDY,461570,465370,"and you need a huge TV, mostly for movies with a little bit"
qSGsMN9UGDY,465370,469050,"of light gaming, it's actually a pretty solid choice."
qSGsMN9UGDY,469050,471360,"And the builtin Google assistant, Chromecast"
qSGsMN9UGDY,471360,474770,"and Alexa are all nice bonuses,"
