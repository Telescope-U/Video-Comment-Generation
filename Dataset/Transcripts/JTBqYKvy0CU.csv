JTBqYKvy0CU,3660,4720,Hello friends
JTBqYKvy0CU,4800,7720,A lot of you have made a lot of demands for this video
JTBqYKvy0CU,7900,12800,Come let us indulge in an analysis of the Indian education system along with the German education system
JTBqYKvy0CU,12800,14220,A lot of you might already know
JTBqYKvy0CU,14280,19180,"I have completed my University level education- Both bachelors and masters, from Germany"
JTBqYKvy0CU,19620,24200,"And for this video, in this video, I have with me, Bharat Chaudhary"
JTBqYKvy0CU,24340,28500,Bharat is an educational youtuber who makes videos in this field and
JTBqYKvy0CU,28840,33580,"And especially speaking, his field expertise has been Germany related education because"
JTBqYKvy0CU,33740,38340,He has also conducted research regarding this and he has also made videos regarding this
JTBqYKvy0CU,38540,42560,But the difference between Bharat and I is that I have completed both my Bachelors and Masters from Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,42560,45120,And he has completed his Bachelors from India
JTBqYKvy0CU,45120,46300,Which university was it?
JTBqYKvy0CU,46300,49860,Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology
JTBqYKvy0CU,49860,51420,"It is in Murthal, Haryana"
JTBqYKvy0CU,51420,52399,Okay
JTBqYKvy0CU,52400,56220,So you completed your Bachelors in four years from there and then what did you do your masters in?
JTBqYKvy0CU,56220,59780,"I've done my masters from technical university of Hamburg, Germany"
JTBqYKvy0CU,59780,61180,"Okay, so..."
JTBqYKvy0CU,61560,64900,I feel like this video is going to be very useful for you in knowing
JTBqYKvy0CU,64900,67780,what are the differences in both the educational systems?
JTBqYKvy0CU,67820,69920,What are the basic structural differences?
JTBqYKvy0CU,70180,73780,What all can we learn from the German educational system in India
JTBqYKvy0CU,73780,75140,And what can you learn too?
JTBqYKvy0CU,75560,78079,Let us begin comparison from...
JTBqYKvy0CU,78080,79560,Let us begin with school
JTBqYKvy0CU,83240,85619,The first difference crops up in the fourth class
JTBqYKvy0CU,85620,90340,"After the fourth class, the students in Germany get the option of going to three schools"
JTBqYKvy0CU,90340,94600,"One of them is Realschule, another is Gymnasium, and then there's Hauptschule"
JTBqYKvy0CU,94800,99680,"Keeping in mind the student's ability, they are suggested that they should choose one of the three schools"
JTBqYKvy0CU,99680,103380,That means if someone is better at studies then he would be sent to Gymnasium
JTBqYKvy0CU,103380,105340,"If someone is worse at studying,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,105520,107520,"-Would the word ""worse"" be okay to use here?"
JTBqYKvy0CU,107740,111840,"Or maybe we could say they lack the ""abilities"" to study theories"
JTBqYKvy0CU,111840,114420,"-This, in my opinion is a better description"
JTBqYKvy0CU,114660,117800,Because there is a set format in place
JTBqYKvy0CU,117800,119300,"For example, in India we have our exams"
JTBqYKvy0CU,119300,124160,"In Germany too, in order to rank the students or to judge their abilities in a way,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,124160,125520,standardized exams are conducted
JTBqYKvy0CU,125520,126820,"And according to that, they view..."
JTBqYKvy0CU,126820,130520,-And we could say that some children are not good at studies
JTBqYKvy0CU,130700,134400,The studies about science or the studies about history
JTBqYKvy0CU,134400,134939,-Exactly
JTBqYKvy0CU,134940,137120,-The difference is that these two schools
JTBqYKvy0CU,137120,141360,The studies in Gymnasium are conducted in the same way like it is conducted in our schools
JTBqYKvy0CU,141360,143840,But what happens in Realschule and Hauptschule?
JTBqYKvy0CU,144220,149440,"-So what happens in Realschule is that the optionals, the graduation in  Realschule takes place in the 10th class"
JTBqYKvy0CU,149440,152760,"and in Hauptschule, it happens in the 9th class"
JTBqYKvy0CU,152760,157019,"So in this, the best opportunity that lies with the students is that right after completing their schools,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,157020,159800,"they can start directly with their  ""Ausbildung"" or vocational training"
JTBqYKvy0CU,159980,161980,The advantage with vocational training is that
JTBqYKvy0CU,161980,163700,they are carrying on their studies
JTBqYKvy0CU,163760,165620,They're learning some kind of trade in a way
JTBqYKvy0CU,165620,169000,"say, carpentry, plumbing, driving... or anything or that sort"
JTBqYKvy0CU,169440,171160,and earning money at the same time
JTBqYKvy0CU,171160,172840,"So, they are being payed every month"
JTBqYKvy0CU,172840,176379,"-So, that means, a child can commence working right after the tenth class"
JTBqYKvy0CU,176380,178780,"Upon the completion of his education, he would directly start his job"
JTBqYKvy0CU,178780,181120,(If) someone wants to work directly
JTBqYKvy0CU,181120,183260,"I mean, a lot of people are not interested in studies"
JTBqYKvy0CU,183260,185340,So this is a good option in exchange
JTBqYKvy0CU,185340,186879,-It is an amazing option for those
JTBqYKvy0CU,186880,191100,"Plus, for those, in my opinion, who come from economically weaker families"
JTBqYKvy0CU,191100,197460,"So it is a great option for them that they finish school and immediately start with their profession, in a way"
JTBqYKvy0CU,197460,197960,-Yes
JTBqYKvy0CU,197960,199300,-And with that...
JTBqYKvy0CU,199300,203400,-What kind of jobs are done in this field?
JTBqYKvy0CU,203620,208760,"-Generally, all the jobs that we can see in our daily lives, in a way,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,208760,214959,"for example, selling, or working in a supermarket, or driving..."
JTBqYKvy0CU,214960,217280,"-... plumbing, carpentry"
JTBqYKvy0CU,217280,219860,gardening... all the jobs like these
JTBqYKvy0CU,219860,225460,"that do not come under the proper purview of engineering, humanities or universities"
JTBqYKvy0CU,225460,230420,"All that is viewed on the extra side,  they are vocationally trained upto a large extent"
JTBqYKvy0CU,230420,235280,"- A vast difference is that in India, we view these jobs at a very low level"
JTBqYKvy0CU,235280,240080,We look at things and presume that the people of the lower (caste/class) do these kinds of jobs
JTBqYKvy0CU,240080,245740,"and our parents poke fun and say that if you don't study, will you do carpentry and become a carpenter ?"
JTBqYKvy0CU,245740,246740,or a plumber?
JTBqYKvy0CU,246740,251060,The difference (here) is that these jobs are given the same respect in Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,251480,255860,-I used to give an example to Dhruv earlier
JTBqYKvy0CU,256120,259620,I knew a friend who is a carpenter
JTBqYKvy0CU,259620,262780,"His salary at the moment is 3,200 Euros"
JTBqYKvy0CU,262780,268500,"and after completing Masters, if I had completed masters in structural engineering,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,268560,272880,"After completion of masters, my salary in designing firms would be 3,600 Euros"
JTBqYKvy0CU,272880,275380,-So there isn't a lot of difference in salary
JTBqYKvy0CU,275380,277520,-There is a difference of about 400 Euros
JTBqYKvy0CU,277520,280780,-So this could also be a reason why these jobs are viewed on the same levels
JTBqYKvy0CU,280780,283040,(because) the salaries are similar
JTBqYKvy0CU,283040,284840,"-The salaries are similar, the lifestyles are similar"
JTBqYKvy0CU,284840,287360,All the things that can be afforded by an engineer
JTBqYKvy0CU,287360,290979,"can also be afforded by the ones with vocational training, to a large extent"
JTBqYKvy0CU,290980,295900,"- Most probably, a question that will arise in people's minds is why would anyone want to do engineering then?"
JTBqYKvy0CU,296480,300200,"-Umm, you know, engineering in German is extremely exhaustive"
JTBqYKvy0CU,300200,305220,If people pursued engineering with the aim of getting good jobs...
JTBqYKvy0CU,305220,306280,-... and (with the aim of) earning money
JTBqYKvy0CU,306280,307780,"-(with the aim of) earning money, then"
JTBqYKvy0CU,307780,311400,The trouble with this is that engineering is a very tough trade here in Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,311400,314340,Testings are conducted in a variety of different ways
JTBqYKvy0CU,314340,316940,There's a lot of practical work
JTBqYKvy0CU,316940,318560,So the dropout rates increase
JTBqYKvy0CU,318560,321800,"If you notice, the dropout rates in Germany are very high"
JTBqYKvy0CU,321800,322340,- Okay
JTBqYKvy0CU,322340,326919,"- Because they see that... First of all, they are not forced to study"
JTBqYKvy0CU,326920,330660,"There's no need for graduation. If you don't want to do graduation, you can do something else"
JTBqYKvy0CU,330660,332260,You can earn money anyway
JTBqYKvy0CU,332500,336140,"So, if there's really a passion to do something in engineering in the future,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,336300,338460,"in Civil, Mechanical or whatever"
JTBqYKvy0CU,338460,340400,then people opt for this
JTBqYKvy0CU,340400,343220,"Generally, people do not opt this for money because"
JTBqYKvy0CU,343220,347960,"because for money, it is an economically smarter decision that you opt for Realschule"
JTBqYKvy0CU,347960,349680,"-So basically, one should focus on their passion"
JTBqYKvy0CU,349680,350180,-Exactly
JTBqYKvy0CU,350180,352860,"-Do whatever you want to do, because one would get paid the same everywhere"
JTBqYKvy0CU,352860,354879,(the money earned) is almost similar
JTBqYKvy0CU,358440,361300,The second difference comes in after 11th and 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,361540,365440,"In India, three options are provide- Science, commerce or humanities"
JTBqYKvy0CU,366020,369000,"How can one make a choice between three options, I mean..."
JTBqYKvy0CU,369400,372759,"(it is akin to ) fitting thousands, millions of kids in the same category"
JTBqYKvy0CU,372760,373440,-Hmm
JTBqYKvy0CU,373440,377360,-The difference in Germany is that there is much more freedom than that
JTBqYKvy0CU,377360,381340,You can individually pick out what subjects you want to study in the 11th and 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,381480,384220,So one can study Biology and History along with it.
JTBqYKvy0CU,384220,387160,"If you want to study Politics along with Chemistry, then you can do that too"
JTBqYKvy0CU,387160,389480,This is not possible in India in the 11th and 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,389480,390660,-Right? -Right.
JTBqYKvy0CU,390920,393600,"It is very difficult. As far as I have seen,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,393600,397060,Some kids want to keep a lot of options open for themselves
JTBqYKvy0CU,397060,400820,What they do is the ones in Non medicals take up Biology too
JTBqYKvy0CU,400820,403240,And then they appear for both Medical as well as non medical exams
JTBqYKvy0CU,403240,407699,"But it becomes extremely successful, because, in a way, both have separate directions"
JTBqYKvy0CU,407940,410000,People begin having problems because of it later
JTBqYKvy0CU,410000,414120,"In fact in India, they say that if you want to keep your options open, then opt for science"
JTBqYKvy0CU,414120,415800,"-Yeah, right!"
JTBqYKvy0CU,415800,422800,"-Taking up science means that they never studied History ,civics ,philosophy or ethics in the 11th and 12th"
JTBqYKvy0CU,422820,424520,So a lot of people do not have knowledge about these
JTBqYKvy0CU,424520,429379,-Exactly. The biggest issue with this is that.. I have studied my Bachelors in a University in India
JTBqYKvy0CU,429380,436400,"All the students who studied with me, are not pursuing government jobs after completing their Bachelors"
JTBqYKvy0CU,436400,441360,"Now, this means that they have to study History as well as Civics... which does not make any sense!"
JTBqYKvy0CU,441360,445300,-So they were forced to study things they need not have in the 11th and 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,445300,448360,"So the system, in a way, compels one to study these"
JTBqYKvy0CU,448360,449659,"and here, it does not compel one to do the same"
JTBqYKvy0CU,449660,450340,-Exactly
JTBqYKvy0CU,453560,456760,-Let us now come to Universities. Universities are your expertise
JTBqYKvy0CU,456760,458900,"-Right, brother. Ask away"
JTBqYKvy0CU,459080,464860,"The first difference in the Universities, which, I think, is very student friendly, is"
JTBqYKvy0CU,464860,466639,is that there are tuition fees
JTBqYKvy0CU,466640,468140,The tuition fee is zero
JTBqYKvy0CU,468140,472320,"In order to study in the Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,472640,475200,I paid around a minimum of 1.5 lakh fees every year
JTBqYKvy0CU,475360,479479,"And here, there is semester contribution of TUHH. There is no tuition fee"
JTBqYKvy0CU,479740,482319,And that is merely 300 Euro per semester
JTBqYKvy0CU,482320,486700,"So that amounts to a total of 600 Euro per year. Converting in rupees, that amounts to 50,000 rupees"
JTBqYKvy0CU,486860,492539,"The topic of tuition fees is extremely relevant because recently, there has been news about a fee hike in IIT for Mtech"
JTBqYKvy0CU,492880,495900,Even the government universities in India have started becoming unaffordable
JTBqYKvy0CU,495900,497180,which did not happen before
JTBqYKvy0CU,497180,500400,"Recently, news has also begun pouring in from JNU that I have been reading about"
JTBqYKvy0CU,500400,506479,The 10 rupees/month hostel rent fees in JNU
JTBqYKvy0CU,506480,508480,has been increased to more than 1000 rupees
JTBqYKvy0CU,508480,510660,Electricity and water charges have been added
JTBqYKvy0CU,510920,515400,"So if you make education unaffordable for the economically weak,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,515400,516880,then people cannot remain educated
JTBqYKvy0CU,516880,517599,-Exactly
JTBqYKvy0CU,517599,522779,-Germany is able to achieve this because it subsidizes education
JTBqYKvy0CU,522780,528860,"-The money of the taxpayers goes into education subsidy, due to which everyone can afford free education"
JTBqYKvy0CU,529260,531960,What's wondrous is that the Bachelors that you completed there
JTBqYKvy0CU,531960,535960,The college facilities must have been substandard despite paying higher fees
JTBqYKvy0CU,536300,539620,"-I'm telling you, in the hostel we used to go to the toilets in the morning and find out there's no water-"
JTBqYKvy0CU,539620,540839,things were that bad
JTBqYKvy0CU,541220,545519,"And I mean, I could not believe in the beginning at how could such a thing happen?!"
JTBqYKvy0CU,545520,550040,They had said that everyone would get single rooms after doing all this
JTBqYKvy0CU,550040,553180,But you wake up in the morning and there are such basic amenities lacking
JTBqYKvy0CU,553280,556540,And you're doing your bachelors in a good government University
JTBqYKvy0CU,556900,558620,because that is considered a good university in Haryana
JTBqYKvy0CU,558620,560680,and then you get to see such things there
JTBqYKvy0CU,560680,564380,So I was extremely disappointed because of that one thing
JTBqYKvy0CU,564520,570620,Talking about the rest... the studies are largely theoretical in India in comparison with Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,570900,574800,"In masters in Germany, I have witnessed that discussions are ongoing in a wonderful way"
JTBqYKvy0CU,574800,578540,"The professors give real life examples and using them, they explain"
JTBqYKvy0CU,578540,584100,"look at this building, look at the columns on it. Here the shear force is applies.. so on and so forth"
JTBqYKvy0CU,584260,588780,"In India, you open R C Verma or any such book of yours"
JTBqYKvy0CU,588880,592020,that from here... S Ramanujan- Theory of structures
JTBqYKvy0CU,592220,594899,Start right here. These are the examples that you have to cover
JTBqYKvy0CU,594900,596700,so this is another vast difference
JTBqYKvy0CU,596700,598640,"-Okay, so the practical is more focused upon"
JTBqYKvy0CU,598640,604260,I don't have experience regarding this because I haven't ever read how much practical and how much theory is there
JTBqYKvy0CU,604260,607880,There is one thing for sure- that is one can avail vacation semesters
JTBqYKvy0CU,607880,611860,"For example, sometime I feel like... The college studies are ongoing"
JTBqYKvy0CU,611860,615420,but I want to take 6 months off. I want to take a break and go on a holiday
JTBqYKvy0CU,615420,616399,Then I can do that here
JTBqYKvy0CU,616400,617880,But this isn't possible in India
JTBqYKvy0CU,617880,619140,"-No, it isn't possible in India"
JTBqYKvy0CU,619140,622240,"What happens in India is that if you don't appear for even one exam, then, first of all,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,622460,625120,"Though, in one exam at least the system allows you to ""reappear"""
JTBqYKvy0CU,625120,629980,"That you can sit for in the next semester, or next year as some universities require that"
JTBqYKvy0CU,630760,637920,"But if you take a vacation for the entire semester, then first of all, the compulsory attendance"
JTBqYKvy0CU,637920,640320,which is 75% in a lot of Universities
JTBqYKvy0CU,640560,644320,"As soon as that falls short, you get suspended for the entire semester in a way"
JTBqYKvy0CU,644320,646920,You get an year back and you have to start with the same semester next year
JTBqYKvy0CU,647220,653800,And the vacation thing is so common here that most people take a yearlong break after 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,654000,657700,"In India, after 12th, people take one year to prepare for the IIT"
JTBqYKvy0CU,658200,664680,"Here, almost every child, goes to Australia, India,US (or other places) for one year"
JTBqYKvy0CU,664680,666520,They go on a vacation for one year
JTBqYKvy0CU,667020,671100,What is it called? Because the students do not have money. So what is this called?
JTBqYKvy0CU,671400,672640,"It is called Au Pair, probably."
JTBqYKvy0CU,672640,676140,"-Yes, Au Pair, where they live for free in my opinion"
JTBqYKvy0CU,676140,679640,"They work in the country that they live in, earn money and roam around"
JTBqYKvy0CU,679640,680140,-Exactly
JTBqYKvy0CU,680140,684740,"-So, the people gather experiences from the world for one year and then commence their studies for college"
JTBqYKvy0CU,685000,688700,"In fact, most people do not know what they are going to do"
JTBqYKvy0CU,688820,693640,"-Thinking about it makes me laugh because in India, (there's only) wearing down (of students)"
JTBqYKvy0CU,693720,696879,"After 12th, for one year"
JTBqYKvy0CU,696880,702220,if you look anywhere else outside your room at anything apart from your books
JTBqYKvy0CU,702220,706639,"the people at home would immediately start commenting, ""study well, you won't get a  university"""
JTBqYKvy0CU,706960,711140,"Look at your uncle's son- he's getting into IIT, NIT"
JTBqYKvy0CU,711560,714600,"Looking at the differences from this perspective, then it feels like"
JTBqYKvy0CU,715200,716520,our country is far different
JTBqYKvy0CU,716520,719900,-A lot of people might think that these differences exist due to the fact that India has a higher population
JTBqYKvy0CU,719900,723180,and hence there is more competition
JTBqYKvy0CU,723180,727360,"Hence, one is bound to study if you want to rise in life, but, I don't think so because"
JTBqYKvy0CU,727360,730180,we took the example of vocational training
JTBqYKvy0CU,730180,735880,It isn't so that there is less competition in Germany and hence people are able to stay so relaxed
JTBqYKvy0CU,736120,738660,The difference lies in the fact that the rest of the jobs also are given equal respect
JTBqYKvy0CU,738660,742000,So not everyone is dying to get into colleges
JTBqYKvy0CU,742240,744360,Not everyone is struggling to get into IIT
JTBqYKvy0CU,744360,751140,"If someone likes carpentry or plumbing or gardening, then he can do so with ease"
JTBqYKvy0CU,754880,758780,Another difference is in placements
JTBqYKvy0CU,760620,764520,"The most comments I get on my YouTube channel, Bharat in Germany, is"
JTBqYKvy0CU,764520,768900,"Sir, tell us about the job opportunities in Germany after completion of Masters"
JTBqYKvy0CU,768900,772500,The most important thing to keep in mind here is that
JTBqYKvy0CU,772500,774760,"In a way, there are no placements in Germany"
JTBqYKvy0CU,774760,779780,The universities do not invite companies to come recruit their students
JTBqYKvy0CU,779980,782240,Like the TCS system in Bachelors
JTBqYKvy0CU,782240,785560,TCS comes and recruits 150 students from the campuses
JTBqYKvy0CU,785860,787600,And how much is the salary?
JTBqYKvy0CU,787600,790920,Sometimes (the students) get a salary of around 12 thousand to 15 thousand
JTBqYKvy0CU,790920,795120,So that does not make sense to me- the students vying for placements
JTBqYKvy0CU,795240,798060,"Because what happens here is that if you've made a good network,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,798060,801060,"you did internships and part time jobs in good companies,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,801140,803480,"Then on, there is direct assimilation in a way"
JTBqYKvy0CU,803480,806860,What the companies do.. where you're working part time jobs...
JTBqYKvy0CU,806960,811560,"After the completion of your masters, if you did a good job, the companies hire you"
JTBqYKvy0CU,811560,813960,"-Okay, so there are no issues of placements"
JTBqYKvy0CU,813960,819000,"Infact, when my friends used to ask me about the placement situation here"
JTBqYKvy0CU,819000,821420,then I used to ask them what placement was
JTBqYKvy0CU,821420,823920,I didn't know about placements
JTBqYKvy0CU,823920,826139,-Placement is such a huge topic in India
JTBqYKvy0CU,826140,830560,If one chooses a University and enrolls in it
JTBqYKvy0CU,830560,835080,and then someone comes and jokes that there aren't any placements there
JTBqYKvy0CU,835080,837620,the person would suffer from a heartattack!
JTBqYKvy0CU,841600,848300,It is obvious that you would be more interested to know how the system in Germany runs
JTBqYKvy0CU,848300,850160,If you want to come study here then what do you have to do
JTBqYKvy0CU,850160,854759,Here I'd like to tell you that Bharat has designed a course of his own- What is the name of the course?
JTBqYKvy0CU,854760,856920,-The name of the course is Complete course for studying in Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,856920,859380,which is on academy.bharatingermany.com
JTBqYKvy0CU,859520,865280,"I made this course because first of all, I had an idea of the Indian study system"
JTBqYKvy0CU,865280,868940,"After that, what was the basis on which I applied for German Universities on my own"
JTBqYKvy0CU,868940,871860,What were the difficulties that I faced and what were the mistakes I made at that time...
JTBqYKvy0CU,871860,876680,-So basically it spells out all that one has to do to apply for German universities
JTBqYKvy0CU,876680,879620,if you want to study here and what are the opportunities
JTBqYKvy0CU,879620,881760,The course has explained all this in great detail
JTBqYKvy0CU,881760,886440,-There are around 40 plus lessons in there with a lot of step by step details
JTBqYKvy0CU,886440,889640,"-So if you want to go into details, then I would say you can go into the course"
JTBqYKvy0CU,889680,895200,And there's a special 10% discount for you here if you use the code Dhruv Rathee
JTBqYKvy0CU,895200,897700,You will get the course link in the description below
JTBqYKvy0CU,898100,900279,You need to go and enter the code there
JTBqYKvy0CU,900280,904460,"-Or if you click on the link in the description directly, the code would already be applied there"
JTBqYKvy0CU,904500,910500,Here I'd like to mention one thing -because I've seen that there are plenty of education consultants  in India
JTBqYKvy0CU,910500,912980,And the worst thing about it is that
JTBqYKvy0CU,912980,916639,they themselves have never studied masters in the University that they're sending you to
JTBqYKvy0CU,916640,919300,Sometimes they don't even have a bachelor's degree
JTBqYKvy0CU,919300,922680,But they sit and send students into private institutes in huge numbers
JTBqYKvy0CU,922680,925839,And that seems very hypocritical to me
JTBqYKvy0CU,925840,927860,Because I only preach about Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,927860,931420,because I know the difference in Germany and I know the Inside out of Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,931420,932420,-...because you have done masters here
JTBqYKvy0CU,932420,934800,-Neither am I promoting Canada or the US or anywhere else
JTBqYKvy0CU,934800,937560,I only know about Germany as I have a first hand experience in Germany
JTBqYKvy0CU,937560,941880,and I can guide the students for only that in a proper way
JTBqYKvy0CU,942060,945880,"In comparison, the people would say that you too are charging money for the course though"
JTBqYKvy0CU,946120,950040,So why should people prefer paying you over a consulting company?
JTBqYKvy0CU,950040,951579,-Because the main thing is that
JTBqYKvy0CU,951700,955660,"Here, if you outsource one of the very important decisions of your life to someone else"
JTBqYKvy0CU,955660,958740,How do you know that he is doing his best job?
JTBqYKvy0CU,958740,959839,Isn't it?
JTBqYKvy0CU,959840,964160,Hence the ideology of my course is that you take all the good information from the course
JTBqYKvy0CU,964160,966379,you take all the Dos and the Donts
JTBqYKvy0CU,966380,971320,"Use all the formats, templates, examples but fill out the application yourself"
JTBqYKvy0CU,971320,972300,because this is one of the most important decisions of your life
JTBqYKvy0CU,972300,974880,"-Okay, so the filled out applications will not be provided- this is the difference?"
JTBqYKvy0CU,974880,978200,-No... This feels like a very unethical thing to me
JTBqYKvy0CU,978200,983080,because why are you applying on someone else's basis when it is the biggest decision of you life?
JTBqYKvy0CU,983080,988000,So the course will basically teach people how you can apply and do all of this
JTBqYKvy0CU,988000,990360,-What courses are best in what universities?
JTBqYKvy0CU,990360,992680,How should you apply in different universities?
JTBqYKvy0CU,996200,998000,So these are very useful advises
JTBqYKvy0CU,998000,1004500,I feel like these are small things that can easily be implemented in the Indian education system
JTBqYKvy0CU,1004940,1008380,It is not so that a huge change has to be brought about to implement this
JTBqYKvy0CU,1008500,1015700,Some things are very small- like Universities should be given more subsidies so that their tuition fees is reduced
JTBqYKvy0CU,1015700,1018200,People should be given options in courses
JTBqYKvy0CU,1018200,1022200,the students should be given the option of choosing their subjects from the 11th and 12th
JTBqYKvy0CU,1022580,1027760,And if someone does not want to do this then something like vocational training can also be implemented
JTBqYKvy0CU,1028079,1032179,-I feel like the main thing is that children here can pursue their passion
JTBqYKvy0CU,1032180,1037699,"whatever they want... In a way, there are very specific courses"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1037699,1043419,"Assume that 50% of a child's interest lies in one field, 50% in another"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1043420,1045000,"then there is a course for that too, here"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1045000,1049320,- This is a great thing. I've also noticed that the courses here aren't so generalized
JTBqYKvy0CU,1049320,1052620,that one has to pursue civil engineering or Mechanical engineering
JTBqYKvy0CU,1052900,1056120,"One can go into a very specific field if one wants. For example,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1056780,1058780,the universities here
JTBqYKvy0CU,1059540,1062000,one can study numerous subjects
JTBqYKvy0CU,1062280,1065920,like you can be doing your bachelors in African studies
JTBqYKvy0CU,1065920,1068740,you can also be doing a bachelors in Buddhism
JTBqYKvy0CU,1068740,1071520,Bachelors and Masters can also be done in subjects like these
JTBqYKvy0CU,1071860,1074299,Although it is going to be very difficult to get jobs in those fields later
JTBqYKvy0CU,1074300,1076980,But it is all about passion here
JTBqYKvy0CU,1077060,1080380,If you have an interest in studying these things then you can do so very easily
JTBqYKvy0CU,1080380,1082380,"I hope you would have liked this video,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1082380,1085860,you can write down in the comments and tell us if you want to see more videos like these

JTBqYKvy0CU,1088380,1092580,or if you want to see a comparison of the Finland and Indian education system or  a comparison with Japan
JTBqYKvy0CU,1092580,1095000,You can write down in the comments below and tell us
JTBqYKvy0CU,1095180,1098160,If you have more interest in coming here to Germany and study

JTBqYKvy0CU,1102380,1104720,You can get the link in the description below
JTBqYKvy0CU,1105420,1108540,"Before ending the video, I'd like to tell you a small thing"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1108540,1114280,Bharat's study in German course is very useful but its price is very decent
JTBqYKvy0CU,1114500,1117660,It is going to cost 359 Euros after discount
JTBqYKvy0CU,1117980,1119980,He has worked really hard
JTBqYKvy0CU,1119980,1122400,He has dedicated one year to design this course
JTBqYKvy0CU,1122400,1124360,You will notice that there are so many videos in this
JTBqYKvy0CU,1124560,1126440,He has explained everything from the starting to the end
JTBqYKvy0CU,1126440,1129379,"When you come to Germany, which universities are good"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1129640,1131940,What things should you notice while you study the course
JTBqYKvy0CU,1131940,1134840,"How should you take admission, how should the application form be filled"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1134840,1137380,"When you come here, what syllabus can you expect"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1137380,1138980,Then you'd be recruited for a job
JTBqYKvy0CU,1139220,1141480,What salary should you be expecting in the job
JTBqYKvy0CU,1141760,1145580,"If you have to take a residence permit, then what is the procedure for that and what forms do you have to fill"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1145580,1147399,and even how to look for accommodation
JTBqYKvy0CU,1147580,1149840,So there's everything here if you buy it once
JTBqYKvy0CU,1149840,1152480,"But I'd just like to say that before buying,"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1152560,1157080,"Since its price is quite decent, talk to your parents and your family members"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1157080,1161019,and buy it only when you are genuinely interested in coming to Germany to study
JTBqYKvy0CU,1161400,1164240,"You can take your own time, this course is going nowhere"
JTBqYKvy0CU,1164380,1166940,The discount link in the description isn't going anywhere either
JTBqYKvy0CU,1167000,1170040,You will get this in the description for alteast a month or two
JTBqYKvy0CU,1170040,1172040,So there is nothing to worry about
