aKkVqmvs4NA,150,2660,- I think it's fair criticism to say that the last time we
aKkVqmvs4NA,2660,5390,"looked at the house here, we're really focused on my stuff,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,5390,9360,"the speakers, the wires, the gizmos, the power supplies,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,9360,14360,and we glossed over the painstaking work that you and the
aKkVqmvs4NA,14680,16710,other people that I think helped you
aKkVqmvs4NA,16710,18425,as far as I can tell you did most of it (he chuckles).
aKkVqmvs4NA,18426,22150,To make sure that this place is gonna look freaking awesome.
aKkVqmvs4NA,22150,24800,So we are gonna take a look through the new house
aKkVqmvs4NA,24800,28199,and we are going to let Yvonne tell the story this time.
aKkVqmvs4NA,28200,29033,"And you know,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,29033,32279,it's gonna be a good story because it involves owls.
aKkVqmvs4NA,32279,34600,"- Ah, okay."
aKkVqmvs4NA,34600,36620,"- Oh, and I have some wire and speaker"
aKkVqmvs4NA,36620,38890,and power supply stuff to update you guys on as well.
aKkVqmvs4NA,38890,41050,So we're definitely gonna do that too.
aKkVqmvs4NA,41050,42610,We're gonna do it with our sponsor.
aKkVqmvs4NA,42610,43480,- Glass wire.
aKkVqmvs4NA,43480,44940,Are you lagging out while gaming?
aKkVqmvs4NA,44940,46559,Use glass wire and see what
aKkVqmvs4NA,46560,48890,apps are wasting your bandwidth and causing
aKkVqmvs4NA,48890,49970,your games to lag.
aKkVqmvs4NA,49970,54123,Get 25% off today using offer code Linus at the link below.
aKkVqmvs4NA,55317,56150,- Oh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,56150,59233,(piano upbeat beats)
aKkVqmvs4NA,62050,62895,"- Wait, what?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,62895,63760,(person laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,63760,66759,Okay. We're replacing that door handle.
aKkVqmvs4NA,66760,70070,"- I mean, how did I break?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,70070,72040,- Okay. Let's start in the master bathroom.
aKkVqmvs4NA,72040,73530,- Yeah. Watch your step. Brandon.
aKkVqmvs4NA,73530,75159,- Why did you put that right in this.?
aKkVqmvs4NA,75160,78080,- Because I literally dropped it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,78080,79790,And so I didn't feel like picking it up again
aKkVqmvs4NA,79790,81210,since we're starting over here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,81210,83450,The bathroom layout was horrible before.
aKkVqmvs4NA,83450,86979,So this little room here had a shower and a toilet in it
aKkVqmvs4NA,86980,88300,and it's tiny.
aKkVqmvs4NA,88300,91730,So we redid the layout in here besides everything being pink
aKkVqmvs4NA,91730,92850,and gold.
aKkVqmvs4NA,92850,95720,"Now it's all gray, which some people don't like that,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,95720,97100,but we like it (she chuckles).
aKkVqmvs4NA,97100,100130,We have this really nice one and a half person tub.
aKkVqmvs4NA,100130,101759,- Which one of us is the half person?
aKkVqmvs4NA,101760,103790,- I think you're both 0.75.
aKkVqmvs4NA,103790,105500,- I'm pretty sure that's not how you're supposed
aKkVqmvs4NA,105500,106333,to use the tubs.
aKkVqmvs4NA,106333,108330,- It's gonna be awesome. Come try it out with me.
aKkVqmvs4NA,108330,109749,- That that's a good sized tub.
aKkVqmvs4NA,109749,110582,- It is.
aKkVqmvs4NA,110582,111490,- That's not bad actually.
aKkVqmvs4NA,111490,113189,- And the reason we went with one and a half
aKkVqmvs4NA,113190,115670,instead of a two person is because if you did want
aKkVqmvs4NA,115670,117580,"to just have a bath by yourself,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,117580,120400,"it's not gonna take an incredible amount of water to fill,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,120400,121233,you know what?
aKkVqmvs4NA,121233,123190,It was actually really difficult to find faucet
aKkVqmvs4NA,123190,125548,that are high flow. And so finding something that was.
aKkVqmvs4NA,125548,126982,"- Oh, it's hooked up."
aKkVqmvs4NA,126983,128341,(people reacting)
aKkVqmvs4NA,128341,129334,- Okay.
aKkVqmvs4NA,129335,130979,(people laughing)
aKkVqmvs4NA,130979,132112,- Thanks.
aKkVqmvs4NA,134140,137490,"- So we have what I think are beautiful countertops,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,137490,138490,but Jake thinks are dirty.
aKkVqmvs4NA,138490,139763,- Look. It looks dirty.
aKkVqmvs4NA,139763,142950,- It is not dirty. That looks like stone.
aKkVqmvs4NA,142950,145180,"Actually, all of the sinks had to be reinstalled"
aKkVqmvs4NA,145180,147340,because I think the sink guy was just having a bad day.
aKkVqmvs4NA,147340,148870,- I thought I was having a really good day.
aKkVqmvs4NA,148870,151640,"Like, like off kilter."
aKkVqmvs4NA,151640,152550,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,152550,153500,"- I mean, worst comes worse."
aKkVqmvs4NA,153500,155730,"You could always just paint over this, right?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,155730,158036,- Oh my gosh. You cannot be serious.
aKkVqmvs4NA,158036,159629,(person laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,159630,161730,My favorite thing in here is the double shower.
aKkVqmvs4NA,161730,164909,"When we moved into our first place I saw and I was like,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,164910,166650,that is weird. Who does that?
aKkVqmvs4NA,166650,168340,"And then do you think it (computer beeps),"
aKkVqmvs4NA,168340,169940,we used it and loved it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,169940,171430,And now we just couldn't go back.
aKkVqmvs4NA,171430,172262,"- And I don't know,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,172263,173940,"maybe you guys are sitting here thinking that's weird,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,173940,177423,"but the way that I see it, families who shower together."
aKkVqmvs4NA,179220,180980,- So we went from a rinky-dink shower
aKkVqmvs4NA,180980,183250,to this awesome double shower.
aKkVqmvs4NA,183250,185460,- Your walk-in has like stuff in it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,185460,186293,- Really?
aKkVqmvs4NA,186293,187125,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,187126,189110,"- Oh, so nice."
aKkVqmvs4NA,189110,190924,"- Did we re we reused the old stuff, right?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,190924,191756,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,191757,192630,- Yeah. This looks like you'll have enough room
aKkVqmvs4NA,192630,194990,"to store your ""things"" that you have."
aKkVqmvs4NA,194990,195823,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,195823,196655,"- New ""things""."
aKkVqmvs4NA,196656,198690,- Yeah. And then we still have the attic access in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,198690,200430,We'll pull down right into here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,200430,202060,- Is the clearance good enough?
aKkVqmvs4NA,202060,204700,"- Yeah. Ooh, that was close to this though."
aKkVqmvs4NA,204700,205828,- Oh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,205828,207871,- You just have to be careful.
aKkVqmvs4NA,207871,208780,(feet padding)
aKkVqmvs4NA,208780,209862,Do you wanna go up there?
aKkVqmvs4NA,209863,211380,"- No, you don't wanna come up here."
aKkVqmvs4NA,211380,213230,"There's no lights or anything. Oh, wait."
aKkVqmvs4NA,213230,215810,There's a light and it's not powered right now.
aKkVqmvs4NA,215810,218610,"- Anyway, the tile on here is the same tile"
aKkVqmvs4NA,218610,220710,as in shower except the non glossy version.
aKkVqmvs4NA,220710,221660,So it's not slippery.
aKkVqmvs4NA,221660,223940,Yeah. It's really cohesive and nice and open.
aKkVqmvs4NA,223940,224773,I love it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,224773,227180,We're just missing the mirrors and the light fixtures.
aKkVqmvs4NA,227180,228060,- And the TV.
aKkVqmvs4NA,228060,230413,"- Okay. We are not, we're not putting a TV in here."
aKkVqmvs4NA,230413,231245,"- Yes, we are."
aKkVqmvs4NA,231246,232421,"- Linus never uses it in the, okay."
aKkVqmvs4NA,232421,233403,- That's just Internet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,233403,237490,"- That's just so that he could have the option of,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,237490,239630,but that doesn't mean you have to exercise that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,239630,240670,- That's a video.
aKkVqmvs4NA,240670,243130,"- Counterintuitively, we actually made the master bedroom"
aKkVqmvs4NA,243130,245090,smaller as part of our reno.
aKkVqmvs4NA,245090,247510,- We expanded the bathroom so that we could have
aKkVqmvs4NA,247510,249030,"the double shower. And then we just,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,249030,251370,we didn't feel like we needed as much space in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,251370,252459,- Just sleep in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,252460,253293,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,253293,254710,- That's it. Aw (he chuckles).
aKkVqmvs4NA,255770,257010,And other.
aKkVqmvs4NA,257010,258630,"- Hey look, they changed the knobs."
aKkVqmvs4NA,258630,259510,- Oh yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,259510,260359,"Okay, cool."
aKkVqmvs4NA,260359,261549,Yeah. They're crooked.
aKkVqmvs4NA,261549,262449,- They are crooked right now.
aKkVqmvs4NA,262450,263360,So I hope they fix that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,263360,265443,- Yeah. Well you just tighten them and then.
aKkVqmvs4NA,265443,266276,- Okay.
aKkVqmvs4NA,266276,267472,- All my stuff's in too.
aKkVqmvs4NA,267472,268305,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,268305,269500,- So this is where all of my clothes
aKkVqmvs4NA,269500,271390,that I will ever own will go.
aKkVqmvs4NA,271390,274690,- The number of hours we spent looking at floor colors and
aKkVqmvs4NA,274690,275980,"just painstakingly,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,275980,278770,trying to find the right thing was horrible.
aKkVqmvs4NA,278770,280400,"- And it was mostly pointless anyway,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,280400,283419,because there's so much variation from one plant to the next
aKkVqmvs4NA,283420,285710,"that basically every test patch we did,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,285710,286780,it's kind of meaningless.
aKkVqmvs4NA,286780,289560,- I originally saw this color when we put down a whole bunch
aKkVqmvs4NA,289560,291610,"of them and everyone was like, no, no, no, that's horrible."
aKkVqmvs4NA,291610,292969,"That's horrible. And I was like, ah,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,292970,296070,and what happened was they hadn't put the baseboards on.
aKkVqmvs4NA,296070,299840,"So there were still pink all around the room. And so it,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,299840,301690,it actually changed the color of the floor.
aKkVqmvs4NA,301690,302670,Just that little bit.
aKkVqmvs4NA,302670,306240,"- So we have actually sanded this floor, painted it,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,306240,310900,"this color, sanded it again and painted it back this color."
aKkVqmvs4NA,310900,312600,- You know what? Carol was amazing.
aKkVqmvs4NA,312600,314500,He only charged us for the product for worth.
aKkVqmvs4NA,314500,316980,- Shut up. We should definitely tip 'em.
aKkVqmvs4NA,316980,318860,- At least the floor doesn't look dirty.
aKkVqmvs4NA,318860,322840,"- I love these. These are one of my favorite things,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,322840,326590,but for some reason they left all the stickers on when they
aKkVqmvs4NA,326590,328110,installed them.
aKkVqmvs4NA,328110,330669,"These ones are no big deal, but come over here."
aKkVqmvs4NA,330670,332103,How am I supposed to reach that one?
aKkVqmvs4NA,332103,333284,- With the ladder?
aKkVqmvs4NA,333284,334510,- I don't wanna do that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,334510,335343,- Oh yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,335343,337409,The glass is totally crooked on this one. Look.
aKkVqmvs4NA,337410,338243,- Yeah. I don't know.
aKkVqmvs4NA,338243,340378,Maybe the light guy was having a bad day too.
aKkVqmvs4NA,340378,341460,(person laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,341460,344840,So this give you some idea of the kind of fixtures that were
aKkVqmvs4NA,344840,347340,in the house before. Linus wanted me to paint it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,347340,348419,Oh and put it back up.
aKkVqmvs4NA,348420,350090,"- Wait, this is cool."
aKkVqmvs4NA,350090,351730,This was a really fun project.
aKkVqmvs4NA,351730,353880,We did it with help from Colin cause we don't know
aKkVqmvs4NA,353880,355380,"how to use our own laser cutter,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,355380,358287,but each of the kids' rooms has a bespoke sign.
aKkVqmvs4NA,358287,359180,(person laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,359180,363550,That's laser cut wood. This one is our youngest daughter.
aKkVqmvs4NA,363550,368009,Ghosts only was her request for her room. She likes ghosts.
aKkVqmvs4NA,368010,368870,- What?
aKkVqmvs4NA,368870,371103,- Ghosts only literally glows in the dark.
aKkVqmvs4NA,371103,373310,It's not gonna get dark enough in here to be Ellusian.
aKkVqmvs4NA,373310,374550,"- You might. I, I can almost."
aKkVqmvs4NA,374550,376030,- See. Cool right.
aKkVqmvs4NA,376030,378930,- Inside her a room. She actually wants a forest of cats.
aKkVqmvs4NA,378930,381190,"I, I don't really know how those two things go together."
aKkVqmvs4NA,381190,382023,I mean.
aKkVqmvs4NA,382023,382856,- She's five.
aKkVqmvs4NA,382856,384150,- Each kid got to pick their own accent color.
aKkVqmvs4NA,384150,387889,"So she picked purple. And if I can get help opening this up,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,387890,389360,we'll be able to see the forest of...
aKkVqmvs4NA,389360,391460,- Woo good gravy. What is this?
aKkVqmvs4NA,391460,392860,How many of them are there?
aKkVqmvs4NA,392860,394469,- Lots. It's supposed to be a forest.
aKkVqmvs4NA,394470,395303,What do you think?
aKkVqmvs4NA,395303,398002,- Just wait until you have to take it down and four years.
aKkVqmvs4NA,398002,399892,- I don't know if this a very good idea.
aKkVqmvs4NA,399892,400725,- Oh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,400725,401558,- Oh my God. Here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,401558,402720,Should we take one off?
aKkVqmvs4NA,402720,403553,Oh no. Don't do.
aKkVqmvs4NA,403553,404520,- It fine. It's fine.
aKkVqmvs4NA,404520,405440,Don't worry. Don't worry.
aKkVqmvs4NA,405440,407630,I'm not gonna stick it to the wall.
aKkVqmvs4NA,407630,409560,"Oh, it's very staticky."
aKkVqmvs4NA,409560,411240,- I think they are supposed to be removable.
aKkVqmvs4NA,411240,414139,So if you wanted to just so to be like that and then there's
aKkVqmvs4NA,414140,416270,gonna be Kitty's that go on the trees.
aKkVqmvs4NA,416270,418740,- Thanks for holding this so that I can put it back on.
aKkVqmvs4NA,418740,419573,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,419573,421970,- Maybe we should mix some tech into this. Hey look.
aKkVqmvs4NA,421970,422830,Access points.
aKkVqmvs4NA,422830,425909,We actually hung these before and had to take them all down
aKkVqmvs4NA,425910,427850,"for the paint, but they're up again?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,427850,428683,- They're up.
aKkVqmvs4NA,428683,430160,- Okay. You're actually gonna have to take it back down
aKkVqmvs4NA,430160,431240,"because they painted the ceilings,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,431240,433370,the wrong color and it needs to be repainted.
aKkVqmvs4NA,433370,434203,"- You're you're kidding, right?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,434203,435190,- No. It's light blue.
aKkVqmvs4NA,435190,436301,Look at them.
aKkVqmvs4NA,436301,438460,- Did somebody tell the contractor
aKkVqmvs4NA,438460,440630,because they hung out the cameras?
aKkVqmvs4NA,440630,441463,"- Yeah, I guess..."
aKkVqmvs4NA,441463,443070,- Like literally everything.
aKkVqmvs4NA,443070,446000,- They literally put the wrong product on every surface at
aKkVqmvs4NA,446000,449560,"this entire house before I came in and was like, ""Hey,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,449560,451320,you put the wrong product on everything.
aKkVqmvs4NA,451320,453420,- Even though I told you multiple times.
aKkVqmvs4NA,453420,456000,"- In other news, these cameras are amazing."
aKkVqmvs4NA,456000,458580,"These are G4 Bullets. Back when we did a,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,458580,459599,"our current house,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,459600,463020,there was G4 Pros and then there was the G3 Flex.
aKkVqmvs4NA,463020,465840,So you had your 4k and then you had your 1080P.
aKkVqmvs4NA,465840,468760,You had your AI detection events and you had
aKkVqmvs4NA,468760,470320,your no AI detection.
aKkVqmvs4NA,470320,473700,This is your middle ground. Look at that latency.
aKkVqmvs4NA,473700,475110,Huh?
aKkVqmvs4NA,475110,475949,Not bad.
aKkVqmvs4NA,475950,477010,"- Oh, you know, it's funny."
aKkVqmvs4NA,477010,478660,"The contractor that installed these,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,478660,480690,"when I gave of him access to it, to like position them,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,480690,482820,"he was like, wow, these look really good."
aKkVqmvs4NA,482820,485250,"I was like, what do you usually install?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,485250,488640,- Most people get garbage child number two's room.
aKkVqmvs4NA,488640,493270,"Her request was a kitty, dragon, bears,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,493270,495780,"the moon, mountains, trees. And we,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,495780,497980,I think successfully incorporated all of those things.
aKkVqmvs4NA,497980,499842,The butterfly was added at the last minute.
aKkVqmvs4NA,499842,500675,(he laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,500675,502680,- She wanted a mountain scene on the outside because she
aKkVqmvs4NA,502680,505330,"wanted to trick people. And then when you go into her room,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,505330,508460,"it's actually underwater themed. She picked a bright,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,508460,509930,bright blue for her wall.
aKkVqmvs4NA,509930,513820,And what we're gonna do actually is sponge it to make it
aKkVqmvs4NA,513820,516070,look more oceany. Cause right now it's just one salt.
aKkVqmvs4NA,516070,517710,- Get some greens in there and stuff like that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,517710,520240,- We also got these really cool stickers that are glue low
aKkVqmvs4NA,520240,523450,"in the dark. So during the day they looked just like,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,523450,526440,"whatever, see kelp and oh man, I'm drawing a blank."
aKkVqmvs4NA,526440,528750,What are those called jellyfish? Thank you.
aKkVqmvs4NA,528750,530040,And then at night they...
aKkVqmvs4NA,530040,530873,- Whale.
aKkVqmvs4NA,530873,532250,"- And then she picked her own chandelier,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,532250,533980,which I think is amazing.
aKkVqmvs4NA,533980,535800,- It suits her so well.
aKkVqmvs4NA,535800,538519,And of course clip speakers in every single room.
aKkVqmvs4NA,538520,540166,They're all in now.
aKkVqmvs4NA,540166,541540,- I think there's 40 speakers.
aKkVqmvs4NA,541540,542880,"This place is gonna be like,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,542880,544560,there's like another six outside.
aKkVqmvs4NA,544560,547500,- 46 Speakers. And that doesn't include the theater room.
aKkVqmvs4NA,547500,549920,- And the amps that are gonna need to power them.
aKkVqmvs4NA,549920,551670,- Holy crap. How many amps are we gonna?
aKkVqmvs4NA,551670,552750,"- It's content, man."
aKkVqmvs4NA,552750,554650,You'll have to get subscribed. And we'll see.
aKkVqmvs4NA,554650,557810,- The boy is a certified gamer. He asked for gaming themed.
aKkVqmvs4NA,557810,559490,"And then for whatever reason,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,559490,562819,"Mike Wasowski from monsters Inc, which he's not even."
aKkVqmvs4NA,562819,563720,- Like.
aKkVqmvs4NA,563720,565709,And he was one of the ones that was actually consistent.
aKkVqmvs4NA,565710,568040,He wanted an orange sign and the accent in his room is
aKkVqmvs4NA,568040,569199,actually gonna be orange.
aKkVqmvs4NA,569200,571823,"We're gonna be doing the accent in his room. He wants a,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,571823,575293,a mural of like a badminton player hitting a shuttle.
aKkVqmvs4NA,575293,576126,- That's pretty cool.
aKkVqmvs4NA,576126,578029,- Yeah. So we're gonna have fun doing that together.
aKkVqmvs4NA,578030,580300,And then he wanted an owl. So.
aKkVqmvs4NA,580300,582240,"- So the theme fell apart a little bit,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,582240,584279,handcrafted on the cricket cry cut.
aKkVqmvs4NA,584280,585560,- Cricket. Cricket.
aKkVqmvs4NA,585560,587050,- [Yvonne] Yeah. It's super cute.
aKkVqmvs4NA,587050,588220,"- When it was on the ground earlier,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,588220,589310,I thought it was a penguin.
aKkVqmvs4NA,589310,592620,- Cell repeater. I noticed my cell reception wasn't crap.
aKkVqmvs4NA,592620,595260,- I did a speed test earlier. I got like 50 down.
aKkVqmvs4NA,595260,598180,I've never gotten more than like two down in this house.
aKkVqmvs4NA,598180,600730,- When are you guys changing the smoke detectors?
aKkVqmvs4NA,600730,601730,- You guys?
aKkVqmvs4NA,601730,602563,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,602563,603396,- Gave me electricians?
aKkVqmvs4NA,603396,604229,- You.
aKkVqmvs4NA,604229,605680,- Oh and we did change the lights up here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,605680,609220,This entire house was like OG fluorescence
aKkVqmvs4NA,609220,612120,"that were 150 Watts, a bulb."
aKkVqmvs4NA,612120,614920,There's like 90 bulbs in this house.
aKkVqmvs4NA,614920,616273,If you had everything on.
aKkVqmvs4NA,617590,619364,"- Oh, speaking of efficiency,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,619364,620260,(clapping hands)
aKkVqmvs4NA,620260,623240,remember how the power generation and consumption of the
aKkVqmvs4NA,623240,626190,solar appeared to be absolutely identical.
aKkVqmvs4NA,626190,627370,When we showed it to you guys.
aKkVqmvs4NA,627370,628660,- This was a little sus.
aKkVqmvs4NA,628660,630576,"- Well, it turns out the roofing contractors"
aKkVqmvs4NA,630577,635577,and their infinite wisdom wanted to save us $354.
aKkVqmvs4NA,635757,637365,"- No, no, no. It was 279."
aKkVqmvs4NA,637365,642365,- $279 on a six figure job by not installing
aKkVqmvs4NA,643090,646870,the component that monitors household energy consumption.
aKkVqmvs4NA,646870,648040,- Yeah. I even sent them an email.
aKkVqmvs4NA,648040,649985,Like I think something's broken.
aKkVqmvs4NA,649985,650818,(Linus laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,650818,653350,"They're like, oh it wasn't in the scope of work."
aKkVqmvs4NA,653350,655750,What? But anyways it works now.
aKkVqmvs4NA,655750,658160,Yeah. Actually you made more to the than you used.
aKkVqmvs4NA,658160,658993,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,658993,659826,- Yeah. Look at that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,659826,663360,So you produced 37.2 and consumed 25.6.
aKkVqmvs4NA,663360,664193,- So net exported.
aKkVqmvs4NA,664193,665136,- Oh yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,665136,665969,- Yeah. You would think this would be
aKkVqmvs4NA,665969,666802,the big highlighted one.
aKkVqmvs4NA,666802,668330,That's what everyone would wanna know.
aKkVqmvs4NA,668330,670880,- So basically you made a dollar.
aKkVqmvs4NA,670880,672820,"- Hey, wait. I thought this was my tour."
aKkVqmvs4NA,672820,674910,We skipped an entire floor.
aKkVqmvs4NA,674910,676009,- Should we go check out the office?
aKkVqmvs4NA,676010,677290,- Can you try to break less things.
aKkVqmvs4NA,677290,679610,- Wait did you just pull it off again?
aKkVqmvs4NA,679610,682110,"- This is new. I think since you guys last saw it,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,682110,683980,this is our built-in bookshelf.
aKkVqmvs4NA,683981,686910,Linus desk is gonna be somewhere here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,686910,689009,So in the backdrop we'll be able to decorate this
aKkVqmvs4NA,689010,689843,really nice.
aKkVqmvs4NA,689843,692950,He had every single shelf in here wired individually
aKkVqmvs4NA,692950,695690,"for RGB, which Jake told me was just insanity."
aKkVqmvs4NA,695690,698640,- It's not insanity the way that you did it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,698640,699610,- I didn't do it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,699610,700910,"- Is insanity. Well,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,700910,703069,let me just explain to the audience.
aKkVqmvs4NA,703070,706150,"Every single shelf has wiring, which is great,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,706150,708560,but every single shelf only has two wires.
aKkVqmvs4NA,708560,712850,"So you have to put the controllers on each fricking shelf,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,712850,715300,except rather than using a proper controller.
aKkVqmvs4NA,715300,717660,"Like when we could control with Z wave,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,717660,722319,Linus wants to use like PC RGB controllers that you control
aKkVqmvs4NA,722320,725620,with a remote so he can individually change them all.
aKkVqmvs4NA,725620,727420,"Except as soon as you click the remote,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,727420,728790,they're all just get change.
aKkVqmvs4NA,728790,730459,"- Oh, just put a dog, a dog."
aKkVqmvs4NA,730460,732020,Don't lick yourself. Cone on it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,732020,733030,Just always.
aKkVqmvs4NA,733030,735710,- It's not like the signal bounces or anything.
aKkVqmvs4NA,735710,737510,- I don't think there's anything new to tell the people
aKkVqmvs4NA,737510,738343,about this room.
aKkVqmvs4NA,738343,739810,- The ceiling in here is the wrong color too.
aKkVqmvs4NA,739810,740890,So we'll get that fixed.
aKkVqmvs4NA,740890,741839,- Oh yeah. Wow.
aKkVqmvs4NA,741839,743220,- Oh watch your head. Okay.
aKkVqmvs4NA,743220,745740,I would like you right then and there now to admit
aKkVqmvs4NA,745740,747260,"that I was right, this is too low."
aKkVqmvs4NA,747260,749070,Cause you just almost ran into it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,749070,751840,- My whole bottom self is gonna phase right
aKkVqmvs4NA,751840,755390,through the table. I but hit my face on.
aKkVqmvs4NA,755390,757370,- Who's gonna have a chair like right here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,757370,759690,- What he would do is you would sit down here and then he
aKkVqmvs4NA,759690,762660,would lean over for something and it'd stand up.
aKkVqmvs4NA,762660,763493,That was the problem.
aKkVqmvs4NA,763493,764326,- That's true.
aKkVqmvs4NA,764326,766230,"I've done that many times. Then the wifi in this place,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,766230,768720,all bars all the time.
aKkVqmvs4NA,768720,770470,"- It's not as fast as my wifi, but."
aKkVqmvs4NA,772210,775510,"- Ooh, I everything's in the pantry now."
aKkVqmvs4NA,775510,778490,"If you had asked me to take apart some, you know,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,778490,782140,in closet shelving and then wait a year and try and put it
aKkVqmvs4NA,782140,782973,back to can.
aKkVqmvs4NA,782973,784035,(people laughing)
aKkVqmvs4NA,784035,786160,"- This, this is supposed to change, right?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,786160,788680,"- It's supposed to originally, but you know what?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,788680,790810,"I actually kind of like it, it goes with the blue."
aKkVqmvs4NA,790810,792940,It's not very modern though. That's the only issue.
aKkVqmvs4NA,792940,795560,- It's not so bad when near here and then you back up
aKkVqmvs4NA,795560,798890,"and you're like, whoa, brand new stainless appliances."
aKkVqmvs4NA,798890,801930,"- Honestly, my bigger issue is the sharp corners"
aKkVqmvs4NA,801930,803339,on this countertop here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,803340,804173,- Oh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,804173,805616,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,805617,806640,- Can you stop?
aKkVqmvs4NA,806640,809690,- This was actually incredibly difficult to find
aKkVqmvs4NA,809690,813010,because we used all of the old kitchen cabinetry.
aKkVqmvs4NA,813010,814850,This is not a standard sizing anymore.
aKkVqmvs4NA,814850,817630,This is a 27 inch instead of a 30 inch.
aKkVqmvs4NA,817630,820240,And this was one of the only double ovens I could find
aKkVqmvs4NA,820240,821135,that was that size.
aKkVqmvs4NA,821135,821968,- Double ovens.
aKkVqmvs4NA,821968,822801,Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,822801,823634,"- Hey, you laugh."
aKkVqmvs4NA,823634,824620,"But double ovens, pretty sick."
aKkVqmvs4NA,824620,828520,"I mean, you don't wanna have to like oven your dessert."
aKkVqmvs4NA,828520,830720,How awesome does the family room look?
aKkVqmvs4NA,830720,831863,These are gonna be black.
aKkVqmvs4NA,831864,833070,(people laughing)
aKkVqmvs4NA,833070,837400,"And then this is pretty much done, it looks like a 65 inch."
aKkVqmvs4NA,837400,838660,What are we going for this one?
aKkVqmvs4NA,838660,840470,- I think an A90J would be sick.
aKkVqmvs4NA,840470,844110,"- So 65 inch, A90J and then I think we're either gonna reuse"
aKkVqmvs4NA,844110,849089,the old Sonos arc or that Sony A9HT
aKkVqmvs4NA,849090,851680,or whatever it's called the four piece surrounding.
aKkVqmvs4NA,851680,852630,"- Yeah, we should definitely do that."
aKkVqmvs4NA,852630,853600,- I think we should do that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,853600,854433,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,854433,856427,- Did Jake tell you about how we tested all the blinds
aKkVqmvs4NA,856427,858160,"and they were great,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,858160,860826,but the problem is that the blinds are not the right color.
aKkVqmvs4NA,860826,861659,(she chuckles)
aKkVqmvs4NA,861659,864020,- See these two colors. Those are supposed to be the same.
aKkVqmvs4NA,864020,866210,I sent them a picture of the swatch
aKkVqmvs4NA,866210,867310,next to what they sent us.
aKkVqmvs4NA,867310,868760,"And they're like, oh yeah, different dial lots."
aKkVqmvs4NA,868760,870943,"It's not even close. Wait, what is that?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,870943,872432,What happened here?
aKkVqmvs4NA,872432,873265,(person laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,873265,874098,- It's not my fault.
aKkVqmvs4NA,874098,875850,- There's still things that need to be changed.
aKkVqmvs4NA,875850,877740,Like the knob and the light fixture.
aKkVqmvs4NA,877740,880220,Unfortunately this cannot be changed.
aKkVqmvs4NA,880220,882967,I am a little disappointed about this.
aKkVqmvs4NA,882967,884060,- You know what? I don't mind it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,884060,885320,- It's less bad than the kitchen.
aKkVqmvs4NA,885320,886530,- The kitchen is atrocious.
aKkVqmvs4NA,886530,888060,- Yeah. That one is weird.
aKkVqmvs4NA,888060,889320,- It's a really big mirror.
aKkVqmvs4NA,889320,892410,- And they put holes in all like almost all of their mirrors
aKkVqmvs4NA,892410,894269,"to have in mirror, light fixtures."
aKkVqmvs4NA,894270,896010,"- They knew, okay, nevermind."
aKkVqmvs4NA,896010,897140,I was gonna make a joke for good.
aKkVqmvs4NA,897140,899524,- One thing we are not doing smart is we are actually
aKkVqmvs4NA,899524,902470,reusing the original appliances because they're
aKkVqmvs4NA,902470,904990,"from like the early nineties, late eighties"
aKkVqmvs4NA,904990,905880,or something like that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,905880,909290,And apparently they're absolute tanks compared to the
aKkVqmvs4NA,909290,911269,washers and dryers they today.
aKkVqmvs4NA,911270,915030,The old owner who was meticulous told us that
aKkVqmvs4NA,915030,917380,"every time she's had them regularly serviced,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,917380,920300,"which of course she does, the texts have come in and said,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,920300,921730,you need to never throw this thing away.
aKkVqmvs4NA,921730,923470,They do not build them like this anymore.
aKkVqmvs4NA,923470,924303,"And she was like,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,924303,926209,"""Okay"", so we're just gonna keep 'em."
aKkVqmvs4NA,926210,927500,- They painted the ceilings in here
aKkVqmvs4NA,927500,929050,without changing the light fixtures first.
aKkVqmvs4NA,929050,931899,"So that's, I don't know."
aKkVqmvs4NA,931900,935510,- I must emphasize the actual quality of the finished work
aKkVqmvs4NA,935510,937360,"has been very good,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,937360,942110,but our painters are just so inefficient.
aKkVqmvs4NA,942110,945839,"You as a non painter might look at this and go, wow."
aKkVqmvs4NA,945840,947970,They did a really great job of taping everything.
aKkVqmvs4NA,947970,951220,But taping things is not the be all and end the all
aKkVqmvs4NA,951220,953129,"because if you tape things,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,953130,956280,you still have to put in the work to cut carefully
aKkVqmvs4NA,956280,960130,because otherwise what happens is you gun up the tape
aKkVqmvs4NA,960130,963280,"with paint like this, you leave it for a month or two."
aKkVqmvs4NA,963280,965300,"And when you rip, rip this paint up,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,965300,969540,unless you go by with like an Exacto knife and cut the edge
aKkVqmvs4NA,969540,971160,"of the tape with a knife,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,971160,973540,you're gonna pull this up and it's gonna rip up
aKkVqmvs4NA,973540,975769,pieces of the wall. They would've been better off.
aKkVqmvs4NA,975770,978650,Just cutting it by hand and fixing with touch ups. Sorry
aKkVqmvs4NA,978650,980890,cutting with a knife versus cutting in with
aKkVqmvs4NA,980890,983670,a three and a half inch angle brush paint here
aKkVqmvs4NA,983670,986120,made me so angry.
aKkVqmvs4NA,986120,987050,Theater room time.
aKkVqmvs4NA,987050,988350,"- I need to warn you as we go in here,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,988350,991459,do not touch or move or play with any of that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,991460,992750,- Oh but it's here?
aKkVqmvs4NA,992750,993583,- Yes.
aKkVqmvs4NA,993583,995210,- The idea behind this is we can use it
aKkVqmvs4NA,995210,999670,to cable manage from the closet there over to the me room.
aKkVqmvs4NA,999670,1002930,And we could use it to just like stash all the ugly cables
aKkVqmvs4NA,1002930,1003763,and stuff in there.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1003763,1004980,There's gonna be power in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1004980,1009298,"So if a friend brought over a PlayStation six or something,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1009298,1012290,you could just plunk it here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1012290,1014550,There'll be an extra HDMI cable to the receiver.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1014550,1017450,That's just like in a hole in here and just pull that up
aKkVqmvs4NA,1017450,1018620,and you're ready to go.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1018620,1021650,"- But dude, it is so dark in here now."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1021650,1023024,- Yes. Thank you.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1023024,1023857,Linus told me.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1023857,1025059,- This is not dark enough though.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1025060,1026034,- Oh my gosh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1026034,1026866,(Linus shouts)
aKkVqmvs4NA,1026866,1027870,"- This is like, this is gray."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1027870,1028850,Why is it gray?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1028850,1031490,- Because I was told that gray that's was fine.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1031490,1032630,- But guess what?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1032630,1033520,"Jake and I have a,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1033520,1036662,"already reached out to the makers of black 3.0,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1036662,1037691,(man laughs)
aKkVqmvs4NA,1037691,1041230,and we are gonna take it to literally avoid.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1041230,1042640,"Yvonne, I don't know why,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1042640,1046199,but she was super into the idea of kind of brown carpet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1046199,1047517,- I was not...
aKkVqmvs4NA,1047517,1049169,- Oh that's awful.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1049170,1050660,- I thought it was okay.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1050660,1051670,- Oh yeah. You know what?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1051670,1052503,That's awful.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1052503,1053690,- We're gonna be in a black void.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1053690,1055049,Does it really matter at that?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1055050,1057280,"- Well, it could be more blacker."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1057280,1059696,"- I don't know. I just give up, this is your guys' room."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1059696,1060529,Have fun.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1060529,1061530,- Cool. Let's change the carpet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1061530,1063150,- I don't know if I wanna spend the money.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1063150,1064650,- Cool. I'll change the carpet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1064650,1066630,- Oh my gosh Jake.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1066630,1069390,- Jake and I are debating the desk colors in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1069390,1072550,"He wants to do black legs, white tops with black chairs,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1072550,1074450,"with red lining. And I'm thinking that,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1074450,1075389,that sounds horrible.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1075390,1077240,"- Well, the walls already blue."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1077240,1080260,"I do agree. We should actually like dye the, the thread."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1080260,1082610,- Okay. You told me it wasn't gonna be a big deal.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1082610,1083443,When I suggested.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1083443,1085500,- I thought we were getting the same chairs as Sarah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1085500,1086333,- Yeah. Well.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1086333,1087460,- Those look awesome.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1087460,1089058,- She veto that that's on my face.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1089058,1089891,- What?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1089891,1091270,- Because it was white cloth and the cat is just gonna tear
aKkVqmvs4NA,1091270,1092380,that apart.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1092380,1093860,- I think we should go natural wood finish
aKkVqmvs4NA,1093860,1094972,for the desks in here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1094972,1095805,- Ooh.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1095805,1096638,- I'm all for it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1096638,1098669,- I'm just not sure it's gonna go with everything else
aKkVqmvs4NA,1098670,1099503,that's already picked.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1099503,1101410,"Are, are we actually gonna die to threads?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1101410,1102243,- Sure.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1102243,1103076,- What?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1103076,1104180,- I don't care how long it takes. I'm not gonna be doing it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1104180,1105025,- You about to wait.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1105025,1105858,- What? I'm not too.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1105858,1107540,- Okay. Do you wanna talk about your finishes
aKkVqmvs4NA,1107540,1108730,in the downstairs kitchen?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1108730,1111230,- All of furniture down here and the accent late fixtures
aKkVqmvs4NA,1111230,1112710,and things like that are all gonna be darker.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1112710,1114330,So I think that's gonna tie it all together
aKkVqmvs4NA,1114330,1115163,and look really good.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1115163,1118779,- There was a big kind of hand ringing stress moment.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1118780,1122110,When the general contractor was like about to show us
aKkVqmvs4NA,1122110,1124220,the fridge that we had chosen.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1124220,1125053,- Do you know why?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1125053,1126410,- Because it sticks out too much?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1126410,1127243,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1127243,1128076,- It doesn't stick out.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1128076,1128909,- I don't think it sticks away.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1128909,1129742,- Well...
aKkVqmvs4NA,1129742,1130575,- Do you think this works?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1130575,1132779,Okay. I'm not a huge fan of the wall color down here.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1132780,1136900,Linus really likes blue tinted stuff. For some reason.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1136900,1138000,- It's white.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1138000,1138833,- It's white.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1138833,1140660,- Which is what you said you liked.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1140660,1142820,- There's a blue undertone for sure.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1142820,1145677,- There's an undertone. Where's your undertone now?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1145677,1147010,- It is. You can see it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1147010,1148060,It's so clear.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1148060,1150870,- It looks blue undertone here
aKkVqmvs4NA,1150870,1153350,and yellow undertone over here
aKkVqmvs4NA,1153350,1156167,because the only difference is the light bouncing off it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1156167,1159179,- It's like this whole thing here is blue undertone.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1159180,1161850,- I actually think the white was the wrong call.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1161850,1162683,Cause like that's...
aKkVqmvs4NA,1162683,1163860,- You are the one that suggested white.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1163860,1166870,- I said white most places.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1166870,1170320,Can't even see the moldings cause it's just so pertly white.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1170320,1172909,- I wanted blue. There's an explanation for this.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1172910,1175870,I was reading the documentation for our receiver
aKkVqmvs4NA,1175870,1178850,and it seemed like it was possible
aKkVqmvs4NA,1178850,1183809,"to have two different inputs going to two different zones,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1183810,1188294,both audio and video simultaneously through this receiver.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1188294,1189127,- You can't do that.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1189127,1191380,- You can just not at 4k 120.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1191380,1192810,- Oh well that's awesome then.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1192810,1196900,So I'm hoping that I can have the Xbox and the gaming PC
aKkVqmvs4NA,1196900,1199940,that powers the theater room and the VR gaming space
aKkVqmvs4NA,1199940,1202559,and the TV there be the same one.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1202560,1205330,And then just share them by using the AV receiver.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1205330,1209179,Remember how I had promised you that like the controller
aKkVqmvs4NA,1209180,1211860,set up and everything would not be complicated.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1211860,1213780,"If we do it this way, it will be very complicated."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1213780,1214920,- Yeah. I figured.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1214920,1215862,- That is my personal...
aKkVqmvs4NA,1215862,1216695,- It's kind of assumed.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1216695,1219580,- That's my personal tech tips guarantee.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1219580,1221260,Also they screwed up the rack power.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1221260,1223650,"It's supposed to be 130 amp,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1223650,1226290,208 volt and then one just regular 120 volt.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1226290,1227690,And they're both just 120 volt.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1227690,1228523,- What?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1228523,1232630,"- Cause Eden sent us this amazing, like five kilowatt UPS."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1232630,1233463,- Oh really?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1233463,1234296,- But it's 208 gold.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1234296,1235690,- We can head outside and I'll tell you why
aKkVqmvs4NA,1235690,1238960,I lost my cool with the pool contractor in a moment.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1238960,1241880,But this gives you an idea of how the good these fireplaces
aKkVqmvs4NA,1241880,1244100,can look. If you paint the gold things black.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1244100,1246100,"So if you still have one of those gold fireplaces,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1246100,1248580,all it takes is a spray bomb.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1248580,1252799,And about like 20 minutes and it can look that much better.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1252800,1254167,- This is a big ass hole.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1254167,1259167,"- $10,000 is what they told us a hole like this costs."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1259440,1261700,"And then they said, ""But stuff can happen."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1261700,1264029,"You might find a big rock or you know, whatever,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1264030,1267560,"a fossilized dinosaur. And it could a, the cost of it."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1267560,1269726,"But we'll let you know."" So then we got a bill."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1269726,1272196,"The whole is completely dug and they go,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1272197,1274330,"""Yeah, it was 25 grand. So we're billing you"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1274330,1277909,"with our 2022 rates, not the rates that we had, you know."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1277910,1280400,- Can't change your rates after quoting someone.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1280400,1282260,- Well you don't have a quote if you don't have
aKkVqmvs4NA,1282260,1283570,an agreed upon rate.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1283570,1287409,"Anyway, to figure out how deep we wanted to go for the pool."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1287410,1290970,I actually conducted an extremely scientific survey.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1290970,1293870,- You called James while I was sitting next to him.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1293870,1296410,"And he was like, ""I have no idea, who cares,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1296410,1298155,"how deep a pool is?"" That's what he told me."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1298155,1300000,"You should be able to dive. I'd say like eight, 10 feet."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1300000,1300833,- You know what?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1300833,1303050,The eight footers lost when the kids are having a pool party
aKkVqmvs4NA,1303050,1303883,or whatever.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1303883,1306610,Not everyone wants to like tread water the whole time.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1306610,1307870,So we settle on six and a half.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1307870,1309750,- So the kids are still gonna have to paddle the whole time.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1309750,1311500,- But you're able to have an even slope.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1311500,1313870,So a lot of people can actually stand all the way up
aKkVqmvs4NA,1313870,1314960,to like the two thirds point.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1314960,1315960,- Nobody can dive.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1315960,1316793,"- I mean, I can dive."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1316793,1317626,- It's a hot tub.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1317626,1318459,- Please.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1318459,1319292,- Big bathtub.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1319292,1320688,- I thought you could dive in six and a half feet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1320688,1321521,"- Well, I can."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1321521,1322354,- What?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1322354,1323187,"- Well, you don't dive straight in."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1323187,1324030,- Yeah. But still.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1324030,1326040,- Some people just need to learn how to swim properly.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1326040,1326920,- Some people just...
aKkVqmvs4NA,1326920,1327753,(man shouts)
aKkVqmvs4NA,1327753,1329093,- Do you wanna see who finishes for the pool?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1329093,1330660,- Are they gonna be dirty? Like the countertop?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1330660,1332720,- This is the band. That's gonna go all the way around.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1332720,1335360,And then it's going to be the stone scape material
aKkVqmvs4NA,1335360,1337650,all down the side and under. Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1337650,1341000,And then the hot tub is gonna be these two. It's not dirty.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1341000,1342097,Come on. It looks nice.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1342097,1343228,- Yeah. That one looks pretty dirty.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1343228,1345700,"- Oh, wait. No, we're not done yet Jake."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1345700,1346533,Check this out.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1346533,1347470,- Don't stand on the (machine beeps).
aKkVqmvs4NA,1347470,1348620,- We haven't shown these yet.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1348620,1349453,- Thanks clips.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1349453,1351100,- Total of six of these.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1351100,1353610,And they actually sound like kind of great.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1353610,1354443,It's gonna be awesome.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1354443,1356318,"- We're just gonna put them all in one zone, right?"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1356318,1357390,"- Oh wait, wait."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1357390,1359139,- Maybe one zone up there and one zone deck.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1359139,1360070,(machine rewinds)
aKkVqmvs4NA,1360070,1361070,"Okay. Whatever, it's your house."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1361070,1362320,I don't care.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1362320,1363153,- Three zones.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1363153,1364289,- Have over it.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1364290,1367060,- And three segues to our sponsor.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1367060,1369380,- And this is a Segue to our sponsor.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1369380,1370670,- Do I have to do it really?
aKkVqmvs4NA,1370670,1371503,- Yeah.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1371503,1372336,"- Okay. I, to segue to our sponsor."
aKkVqmvs4NA,1372336,1374640,"- You know, segues to our sponsor paid for this house,"
aKkVqmvs4NA,1374640,1375630,sponsors like.
aKkVqmvs4NA,1375630,1376463,- Sponsors like.
