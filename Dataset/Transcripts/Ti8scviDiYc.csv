Ti8scviDiYc,0,1599,when dream needed a server that could
Ti8scviDiYc,1599,4560,store unlimited gameplay footage with a
Ti8scviDiYc,4560,6640,matching budget he knew there was only
Ti8scviDiYc,6640,9440,one place to go yo
Ti8scviDiYc,9440,11120,and we're going to be building it in
Ti8scviDiYc,11120,13120,true dream fashion that's right we're
Ti8scviDiYc,13120,15120,going to be speed running the creation
Ti8scviDiYc,15120,18560,of a 1.2 petabyte hard drive storage
Ti8scviDiYc,18560,24160,server with a 200 terabyte all nvme ssd
Ti8scviDiYc,24160,26480,server all we need is a little bit of
Ti8scviDiYc,26480,29480,help
Ti8scviDiYc,31359,33280,all right i think we're going for a
Ti8scviDiYc,33280,35440,world record here guys kyogsi has
Ti8scviDiYc,35440,37600,sponsored the ssd so that's taken care
Ti8scviDiYc,37600,39680,of 45 drives practically built the
Ti8scviDiYc,39680,41840,server for us and you guys are all here
Ti8scviDiYc,41840,44239,to witness it starting with the big face
Ti8scviDiYc,44239,46960,reveal you ready
Ti8scviDiYc,46960,48559,okay it's more of a faceplate but look
Ti8scviDiYc,48559,52760,it's a really cool one it has dream on
Ti8scviDiYc,55380,59840,[Music]
Ti8scviDiYc,59840,62480,let's go jakey oh jesus oh server to
Ti8scviDiYc,62480,64080,build your voice oh this is a lot of
Ti8scviDiYc,64080,66240,drives to shuck because the servers for
Ti8scviDiYc,66240,67920,dream some of the hardware did end up
Ti8scviDiYc,67920,70080,getting sent to us but the hard drives
Ti8scviDiYc,70080,72080,were not one of those things meaning
Ti8scviDiYc,72080,75200,that yes my friends dream actually did
Ti8scviDiYc,75200,76880,shell out for
Ti8scviDiYc,76880,79119,60 the full
Ti8scviDiYc,79119,80200,60
Ti8scviDiYc,80200,83280,20 terabyte hard drives that's going to
Ti8scviDiYc,83280,86320,be a total of 1.2 petabytes of raw
Ti8scviDiYc,86320,88000,storage which should work out to
Ti8scviDiYc,88000,89840,somewhere in the neighborhood of one
Ti8scviDiYc,89840,91920,petabyte of usable storage when we're
Ti8scviDiYc,91920,93119,done here i think we're going to play
Ti8scviDiYc,93119,94479,this one a little bit safer i'll put
Ti8scviDiYc,94479,95840,some hot spare so it might be more like
Ti8scviDiYc,95840,98320,900 okay sure that's fair enough i don't
Ti8scviDiYc,98320,99840,want to get a tech support call
Ti8scviDiYc,99840,101759,realistically from like wherever the
Ti8scviDiYc,101759,104079,crap dream is from the server hardware
Ti8scviDiYc,104079,106159,itself was provided by 45 drives and
Ti8scviDiYc,106159,108399,this is their turbo tier server it's got
Ti8scviDiYc,108399,112960,a 26 core xeon gold 512 gigs of ddr4
Ti8scviDiYc,112960,114720,memory which we'll be using as a zfs
Ti8scviDiYc,114720,118000,read cache we've got four lsi hbas which
Ti8scviDiYc,118000,119920,are allowing us to hook up all of these
Ti8scviDiYc,119920,122320,freaking drives and
Ti8scviDiYc,122320,124560,we actually got them to send
Ti8scviDiYc,124560,126520,a dual port
Ti8scviDiYc,126520,130640,25 gigabit per second network card which
Ti8scviDiYc,130640,133200,um sorry 45 drives we're actually going
Ti8scviDiYc,133200,135280,to steal from this server and put in the
Ti8scviDiYc,135280,137599,ssd server and there is a reason for
Ti8scviDiYc,137599,139040,this
Ti8scviDiYc,139040,141280,the fancy switch hey i need more drives
Ti8scviDiYc,141280,143440,jake hold on shut up world record the
Ti8scviDiYc,143440,145680,fancy switch that ubiquity sent happens
Ti8scviDiYc,145680,146800,to have
Ti8scviDiYc,146800,148879,two 25 gig ports so i'm thinking we put
Ti8scviDiYc,148879,151120,them together aggregate 50 gig to the
Ti8scviDiYc,151120,152319,storage server
Ti8scviDiYc,152319,153920,wow it's probably excessive but we're
Ti8scviDiYc,153920,155519,gonna do it anyways honestly though
Ti8scviDiYc,155519,157519,outside of our own server room he is
Ti8scviDiYc,157519,159120,getting the
Ti8scviDiYc,159120,162160,finest storage setup out of probably
Ti8scviDiYc,162160,164080,anyone else on youtube or twitch by the
Ti8scviDiYc,164080,166239,way jake can i just shout you out for
Ti8scviDiYc,166239,168000,putting these in exactly the correct
Ti8scviDiYc,168000,170319,orientation for me to just am i slot
Ti8scviDiYc,170319,171680,them right in are you being sarcastic
Ti8scviDiYc,171680,173360,are you not trying to no no i was
Ti8scviDiYc,173360,175280,actually no it's like the most ergonomic
Ti8scviDiYc,175280,176640,thing ever i just grabbed them and put
Ti8scviDiYc,176640,177840,them in okay i'll be sure to do it the
Ti8scviDiYc,177840,181120,other way now oh you piece of crap
Ti8scviDiYc,181120,184000,why did i say anything i was not trying
Ti8scviDiYc,184000,185760,at all it just happened to be how they
Ti8scviDiYc,185760,188080,were getting pulled out that's it are we
Ti8scviDiYc,188080,189159,done
Ti8scviDiYc,189159,191840,1.2 petabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,191840,193120,you know it's not that fun when it's
Ti8scviDiYc,193120,196319,this easy what i mean it's i'm now i'm
Ti8scviDiYc,196319,197440,still into it
Ti8scviDiYc,197440,199360,we haven't found out if it works yet so
Ti8scviDiYc,199360,202000,we're replacing this dual 25 gigabit
Ti8scviDiYc,202000,204879,nick with this dual 10 gigabit nick and
Ti8scviDiYc,204879,207120,the reason we're doing that is that i
Ti8scviDiYc,207120,209360,mean they're hard drives realistically
Ti8scviDiYc,209360,211680,if we manage to get you know what 20
Ti8scviDiYc,211680,214400,gigabit trunks so two gigabytes a second
Ti8scviDiYc,214400,216799,out of it that'll be fine i mean it'll
Ti8scviDiYc,216799,218640,just it'll do a lot more than that but
Ti8scviDiYc,218640,220400,you're just using this for archives so
Ti8scviDiYc,220400,221200,yes
Ti8scviDiYc,221200,223280,well yes and no i think it's possible
Ti8scviDiYc,223280,225040,that they could end up editing partially
Ti8scviDiYc,225040,226319,off of it if they were working on a
Ti8scviDiYc,226319,227920,project it'll have plenty for that
Ti8scviDiYc,227920,229599,called back from you know a previous
Ti8scviDiYc,229599,231920,video or something along those lines
Ti8scviDiYc,231920,233200,come on
Ti8scviDiYc,233200,235599,jake what
Ti8scviDiYc,235599,238080,what was the ergonomic rationale behind
Ti8scviDiYc,238080,240239,putting this server here i'm not saying
Ti8scviDiYc,240239,241680,you're wrong i'm just saying i don't see
Ti8scviDiYc,241680,243200,how you're right are you complaining
Ti8scviDiYc,243200,246400,because you're short no
Ti8scviDiYc,246480,248159,i'm complaining because tall people
Ti8scviDiYc,248159,251120,don't consider my short person needs
Ti8scviDiYc,251120,252840,that's what i'm complaining about right
Ti8scviDiYc,252840,255519,right very important distinction
Ti8scviDiYc,255519,257440,unlike the petabyte of hard drive based
Ti8scviDiYc,257440,261359,storage this one actually
Ti8scviDiYc,261600,263199,is going to have a ton of room for
Ti8scviDiYc,263199,266560,expansion and that is thanks to
Ti8scviDiYc,266560,270080,high density drives like the cm6 from
Ti8scviDiYc,270080,272400,kyogre these puppies are available in up
Ti8scviDiYc,272400,275680,to what 15.3 terabytes of top this is a
Ti8scviDiYc,275680,278560,30 terabyte what shut up it's not not
Ti8scviDiYc,278560,280960,only is it a 30 terabyte ssd it's a 30
Ti8scviDiYc,280960,286560,terabyte tlc ssd it's not even qlc
Ti8scviDiYc,286800,288960,these are crazy kiosks just sent these
Ti8scviDiYc,288960,292000,for dream where's mine well they sent 15
Ti8scviDiYc,292000,293360,for dream and i was like yeah we'll just
Ti8scviDiYc,293360,296240,give them like seven oh really yeah it's
Ti8scviDiYc,296240,298080,not like he paid for them yeah that
Ti8scviDiYc,298080,300000,still means he's gonna end up with 120
Ti8scviDiYc,300000,302080,terabytes of usable space with two
Ti8scviDiYc,302080,306400,parity drives and a hot spare
Ti8scviDiYc,306639,308720,wrap your brain around it right
Ti8scviDiYc,308720,311039,this is the state of the art i mean i
Ti8scviDiYc,311039,313840,think they're looking at what 22 to 26
Ti8scviDiYc,313840,315440,in the next year and those aren't even
Ti8scviDiYc,315440,317919,conventional those are shingles exactly
Ti8scviDiYc,317919,321120,this has 50 more capacity than this
Ti8scviDiYc,321120,323440,in a fraction of the size mind you it's
Ti8scviDiYc,323440,324639,probably
Ti8scviDiYc,324639,327039,quite literally 20 times the cost not to
Ti8scviDiYc,327039,329759,mention this is pcie gen 4
Ti8scviDiYc,329759,331680,these will do almost 7 gigabytes a
Ti8scviDiYc,331680,335280,second read on a single drive
Ti8scviDiYc,336160,337840,and that's why we're keeping some yes
Ti8scviDiYc,337840,339199,you should okay so we're gonna do a four
Ti8scviDiYc,339199,343440,node actually wait the what oh my oh my
Ti8scviDiYc,343440,347039,god oh my god how do you do that you
Ti8scviDiYc,347039,347919,just
Ti8scviDiYc,347919,349440,literally
Ti8scviDiYc,349440,351280,holy
Ti8scviDiYc,351280,355120,oh my god oh my god oh my god did i put
Ti8scviDiYc,355120,357039,it back are you
Ti8scviDiYc,357039,358400,kidding me
Ti8scviDiYc,358400,359440,dude
Ti8scviDiYc,359440,363520,what's the actual is wrong with you
Ti8scviDiYc,363520,365360,oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,365360,369280,oh oh i want to throw up i really
Ti8scviDiYc,369280,371120,oh
Ti8scviDiYc,371120,374880,do you think it still works no
Ti8scviDiYc,374880,376240,did you hear the
Ti8scviDiYc,376240,379199,noise in me well it's a pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,379199,381280,it's a pretty bouncy floor
Ti8scviDiYc,381280,382720,okay the video's done i'm leaving
Ti8scviDiYc,382720,384639,goodbye
Ti8scviDiYc,384639,387520,it might still work
Ti8scviDiYc,387520,391870,okay lunch says it still works
Ti8scviDiYc,391870,394000,[Laughter]
Ti8scviDiYc,394000,396639,you know it might actually still work
Ti8scviDiYc,396639,398880,here's the thing i've actually talked to
Ti8scviDiYc,398880,400960,seagate engineers about the kind of drop
Ti8scviDiYc,400960,402319,testing that they do on these things
Ti8scviDiYc,402319,404240,there's a solid chance that thing still
Ti8scviDiYc,404240,405440,works
Ti8scviDiYc,405440,408240,what happened what nothing you talking
Ti8scviDiYc,408240,410720,no no i was just saying that uh you're a
Ti8scviDiYc,410720,413120,fine young man and i'm really proud of
Ti8scviDiYc,413120,415199,the way you've turned out
Ti8scviDiYc,415199,416560,i'm not proud of the way you've turned
Ti8scviDiYc,416560,417599,out
Ti8scviDiYc,417599,420080,this is pretty gorgeous this is the new
Ti8scviDiYc,420080,422000,version of the one we have right yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,422000,425199,that's specifically designed for epic
Ti8scviDiYc,425199,428880,milan so that's a 32 core 75 43p so
Ti8scviDiYc,428880,432800,single single processor it boosts to 3.8
Ti8scviDiYc,432800,435199,gigahertz i think so not quite as good
Ti8scviDiYc,435199,438720,as the 75 f3 yeah but that's pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,438720,440960,freaking incredible this thing is gonna
Ti8scviDiYc,440960,442639,rip are you putting the ram in are you
Ti8scviDiYc,442639,444000,gonna talk about the ram at all i'm just
Ti8scviDiYc,444000,445360,gonna put it in really we're speed
Ti8scviDiYc,445360,449120,running okay well it's gonna be 512 gigs
Ti8scviDiYc,449120,452000,of ram nope what 128 128 that's it
Ti8scviDiYc,452000,453680,they're eight gig dimms these are from
Ti8scviDiYc,453680,455360,the one million dollar pc that we didn't
Ti8scviDiYc,455360,459120,use right microns sent us literally like
Ti8scviDiYc,459120,462160,flats 96. flats
Ti8scviDiYc,462160,465199,of these eight gig ecc 3200 modules
Ti8scviDiYc,465199,467199,they're fast yep they're exactly what
Ti8scviDiYc,467199,469199,you want just not the capacity that you
Ti8scviDiYc,469199,471280,want but for this for you it's perfect
Ti8scviDiYc,471280,472639,because we're not using ram caching
Ti8scviDiYc,472639,474400,since they're nvme drives you don't need
Ti8scviDiYc,474400,476879,that for zfs but he's gonna get 128 gigs
Ti8scviDiYc,476879,479840,anyway so we just want a nice fast cpu
Ti8scviDiYc,479840,482560,which for epic high speed memory is
Ti8scviDiYc,482560,484000,really important
Ti8scviDiYc,484000,486160,and then we're basically not going to
Ti8scviDiYc,486160,488080,hit this at all yeah i mean stuff will
Ti8scviDiYc,488080,490080,go through it but that's it that's
Ti8scviDiYc,490080,493840,pretty much it 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53
Ti8scviDiYc,493840,496879,54 55 36 57 58 59
Ti8scviDiYc,496879,498720,that's it shut up it does not there's
Ti8scviDiYc,498720,500879,only 59 yeah because it starts at zero
Ti8scviDiYc,500879,502240,oh hold on there might be 60 actually
Ti8scviDiYc,502240,504080,hold on it starts at zero doesn't it it
Ti8scviDiYc,504080,506479,might start at zero might be okay that
Ti8scviDiYc,506479,508000,it does are you screen recording there's
Ti8scviDiYc,508000,510240,the moment yeah i'm not screen recording
Ti8scviDiYc,510240,512479,but it does start at zero there is 60.
Ti8scviDiYc,512479,513919,that doesn't necessarily mean one of
Ti8scviDiYc,513919,516800,them isn't completely buggered okay
Ti8scviDiYc,516800,519440,cooler time yeah wow this is a
Ti8scviDiYc,519440,521360,beefy cooler for a two years yeah the
Ti8scviDiYc,521360,523518,nice thing about a 2u is you get
Ti8scviDiYc,523518,525200,double the cooler capacity which means
Ti8scviDiYc,525200,527200,your fans get to spin a lot slower yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,527200,528640,which is going to be good for at your
Ti8scviDiYc,528640,529440,house
Ti8scviDiYc,529440,532000,yeah one user like we're using a similar
Ti8scviDiYc,532000,534000,machine to this at my place right yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,534000,536240,okay just a less cool one oh really so
Ti8scviDiYc,536240,537680,dream's going to have a better server
Ti8scviDiYc,537680,539519,than me yeah i'm feeling pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,539519,541920,inadequate right now i love these
Ti8scviDiYc,541920,544240,tool-less sleds man when i built the
Ti8scviDiYc,544240,547920,first nvme wanik it took frickin forever
Ti8scviDiYc,547920,549519,and i didn't even put all the screws in
Ti8scviDiYc,549519,552160,oh these are so much easier to deal i
Ti8scviDiYc,552160,553600,can't believe
Ti8scviDiYc,553600,556320,that every one of these is 30 freaking
Ti8scviDiYc,556320,559200,terabytes i just installed 60 terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,559200,562480,of ssd storage hold on here comes number
Ti8scviDiYc,562480,563680,90
Ti8scviDiYc,563680,567040,90. like freaking what i mean we do have
Ti8scviDiYc,567040,569760,more we can put more they're dense yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,569760,571279,they're i was going to grab one of the
Ti8scviDiYc,571279,573279,cd6s which are like the not enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,573279,576080,ones um they are substantially heavier
Ti8scviDiYc,576080,578560,these things are dense as here david
Ti8scviDiYc,578560,579519,catch
Ti8scviDiYc,579519,581680,i don't know i know hold on a second no
Ti8scviDiYc,581680,584399,i want to i want to open it what no yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,584399,587360,no yeah chill jesus just relax what's
Ti8scviDiYc,587360,588800,the worst that can happen i lose the
Ti8scviDiYc,588800,592320,screws and we can't put it back together
Ti8scviDiYc,594160,598399,it's got a multi pcb design oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,598399,601040,of course it does oh my god these caps
Ti8scviDiYc,601040,602959,though that's gonna be the difference
Ti8scviDiYc,602959,605040,these are their actual enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,605040,607440,capacity they're willing to say it's
Ti8scviDiYc,607440,608959,enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,608959,611120,this is for power loss protection these
Ti8scviDiYc,611120,614480,capacitors ensure that if any data is
Ti8scviDiYc,614480,616640,sitting in a cache or in a dram cache
Ti8scviDiYc,616640,619440,for example it can be flushed to nand
Ti8scviDiYc,619440,621760,before the drive actually powers down
Ti8scviDiYc,621760,623600,even in the event of a sudden power loss
Ti8scviDiYc,623600,626000,to the server that's freaking cool and
Ti8scviDiYc,626000,627200,those are
Ti8scviDiYc,627200,630160,huge look at the little holes
Ti8scviDiYc,630160,633200,wait they have cooling for the caps
Ti8scviDiYc,633200,634800,that's amazing
Ti8scviDiYc,634800,637519,wow i'm so happy right now that's so
Ti8scviDiYc,637519,639680,much nan how much nand is that man hold
Ti8scviDiYc,639680,641600,on we gotta find more nand we're going
Ti8scviDiYc,641600,643760,on a we're going on a voyage oh there's
Ti8scviDiYc,643760,645839,a clip there's a clip here no hold on
Ti8scviDiYc,645839,649120,hold on oh my god this is so cool oh i
Ti8scviDiYc,649120,650640,never get a chance to play with stuff
Ti8scviDiYc,650640,653760,like this god damn it
Ti8scviDiYc,654000,656880,there's another layer hold on so they
Ti8scviDiYc,656880,659279,got thermal pads between
Ti8scviDiYc,659279,660480,oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,660480,662000,jake
Ti8scviDiYc,662000,664640,i think it's three layers
Ti8scviDiYc,664640,667839,jake no stop please stop hold on please
Ti8scviDiYc,667839,669440,please
Ti8scviDiYc,669440,670399,relay
Ti8scviDiYc,670399,672839,i can't do this i think it's three
Ti8scviDiYc,672839,675200,legs on how do we get this layer my
Ti8scviDiYc,675200,677160,heart there it goes
Ti8scviDiYc,677160,679440,holy balls
Ti8scviDiYc,679440,680800,it's got
Ti8scviDiYc,680800,681839,four
Ti8scviDiYc,681839,684079,dram cash dies what about that
Ti8scviDiYc,684079,687680,controller that thing is huge
Ti8scviDiYc,687680,689040,hold on here it goes here it goes here
Ti8scviDiYc,689040,691839,it goes oh
Ti8scviDiYc,691920,693120,ain't
Ti8scviDiYc,693120,695360,wait there's more
Ti8scviDiYc,695360,696880,gas
Ti8scviDiYc,696880,698800,well that's the thing is the higher
Ti8scviDiYc,698800,701920,capacity you go for your nan flash the
Ti8scviDiYc,701920,704399,more dram cash you need and if you're
Ti8scviDiYc,704399,707519,gonna have 30 freaking terabytes demand
Ti8scviDiYc,707519,709600,you're going to need a lot of dram eight
Ti8scviDiYc,709600,712079,gigabit one g by eight
Ti8scviDiYc,712079,713680,so it's one gig so it'd be eight gigs i
Ti8scviDiYc,713680,716959,guess eight gigs of flippin ram
Ti8scviDiYc,716959,720880,this ssd has as much as most people's
Ti8scviDiYc,720880,723040,gaming machines there's a new update i
Ti8scviDiYc,723040,724480,brought out the unify switch we were
Ti8scviDiYc,724480,726079,kind of originally thinking we might
Ti8scviDiYc,726079,727920,build a whole rack and send it to him
Ti8scviDiYc,727920,730399,but then apparently his like installers
Ti8scviDiYc,730399,732079,are doing a bunch of crap so we're just
Ti8scviDiYc,732079,733920,gonna give him the switch yeah this
Ti8scviDiYc,733920,736000,switch has two 25 gig ports that we're
Ti8scviDiYc,736000,738240,going to aggregate together to be 50 gig
Ti8scviDiYc,738240,740079,for nvme server totally probably
Ti8scviDiYc,740079,741440,overkill for what he's doing and then
Ti8scviDiYc,741440,743279,we're going to do two 10 gigs aggregated
Ti8scviDiYc,743279,745680,together for 20 gig to the hard drives
Ti8scviDiYc,745680,748399,then all these other ports are 10 gig to
Ti8scviDiYc,748399,750160,the rest of the house so that means if
Ti8scviDiYc,750160,752880,for whatever reason they expanded and
Ti8scviDiYc,752880,755200,had like a whole team of editors there
Ti8scviDiYc,755200,757760,they could have five people concurrently
Ti8scviDiYc,757760,760000,hitting this boy for 50 gigabits a
Ti8scviDiYc,760000,762240,second and this boy for 20 gigabits a
Ti8scviDiYc,762240,764560,second that is a lot of throughput for
Ti8scviDiYc,764560,766000,game play and if you really wanted you
Ti8scviDiYc,766000,767839,could switch this to a 4x10 card and
Ti8scviDiYc,767839,769360,then you could have 40 gig each editor
Ti8scviDiYc,769360,770959,will get its own 10 gigabits it's pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,770959,773440,sick it's a nice little switch ah you
Ti8scviDiYc,773440,774639,were gonna show me something cool
Ti8scviDiYc,774639,776240,there's a new view yeah hey look so they
Ti8scviDiYc,776240,778480,added this new port view so now instead
Ti8scviDiYc,778480,780480,of having to edit a port one by one you
Ti8scviDiYc,780480,781440,can go
Ti8scviDiYc,781440,783760,hey i wanna edit that one that one that
Ti8scviDiYc,783760,785760,one that one and maybe this one over
Ti8scviDiYc,785760,788639,here oh that's cool and you can set
Ti8scviDiYc,788639,791519,bam i only want this now security-minded
Ti8scviDiYc,791519,794160,folks might put mac address like limits
Ti8scviDiYc,794160,796240,so only that one mac address can connect
Ti8scviDiYc,796240,798240,to that port it's a nice security thing
Ti8scviDiYc,798240,799839,you can also see what device is
Ti8scviDiYc,799839,801279,connected to a specific port a lot
Ti8scviDiYc,801279,803440,easier so i can just click on it so i
Ti8scviDiYc,803440,805760,plug the bmc into that one port and then
Ti8scviDiYc,805760,806639,i just
Ti8scviDiYc,806639,808560,click on that there's the ip here's a
Ti8scviDiYc,808560,810320,cool feature for ubiquity it would be
Ti8scviDiYc,810320,812800,really nice to be able to take this go
Ti8scviDiYc,812800,815040,yes that's the device that i want and
Ti8scviDiYc,815040,816000,just
Ti8scviDiYc,816000,818079,set a rule that only that mac address
Ti8scviDiYc,818079,819680,can connect to that port just with one
Ti8scviDiYc,819680,821279,click here yeah if you just go like a
Ti8scviDiYc,821279,823920,limit yeah lock mac address lock that
Ti8scviDiYc,823920,825600,would be cool i bet they'll do it
Ti8scviDiYc,825600,826639,they're probably gonna watch this and
Ti8scviDiYc,826639,827519,they're probably going to do it yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,827519,830000,they might do it hey guess what it works
Ti8scviDiYc,830000,831839,now i got a vga cable because i thought
Ti8scviDiYc,831839,834320,the ipmi was broken turns out they
Ti8scviDiYc,834320,836800,screwed up i love you gigabyte but they
Ti8scviDiYc,836800,839440,sent a server that doesn't support milan
Ti8scviDiYc,839440,840720,chips no
Ti8scviDiYc,840720,843199,it's a roam server it's a roam server do
Ti8scviDiYc,843199,845279,we have any roam chips to we do so we
Ti8scviDiYc,845279,848720,had a 75 or 70 402 p which is a 24 core
Ti8scviDiYc,848720,850720,still going to be plenty
Ti8scviDiYc,850720,853120,for this yeah for the
Ti8scviDiYc,853120,855360,cut down drive configuration that we put
Ti8scviDiYc,855360,857440,in here anyway yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,857440,859120,okay it's gonna be great
Ti8scviDiYc,859120,861120,okay so now it'll actually be great yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,861120,862639,we're in truenast now on both of them
Ti8scviDiYc,862639,864399,we're gonna be using trinas core as much
Ti8scviDiYc,864399,866800,as i like scale core is a little more
Ti8scviDiYc,866800,869199,production ready yeah and we want this
Ti8scviDiYc,869199,870480,to just work and him not to have to
Ti8scviDiYc,870480,872560,screw with it and this is actually
Ti8scviDiYc,872560,874639,shockingly user friendly to use these
Ti8scviDiYc,874639,877519,days back in the early frenzy oh boy you
Ti8scviDiYc,877519,880000,had to kind of be nerdy enough that you
Ti8scviDiYc,880000,881600,could have basically done it yourself in
Ti8scviDiYc,881600,885120,linux anyway now man this gui is so
Ti8scviDiYc,885120,886800,pretty okay
Ti8scviDiYc,886800,888240,linem ti which one do you want to start
Ti8scviDiYc,888240,889839,with i want to start with the one that
Ti8scviDiYc,889839,892800,definitely has a working drive in this
Ti8scviDiYc,892800,894800,slot right here
Ti8scviDiYc,894800,897199,i will admit there are 60 functioning
Ti8scviDiYc,897199,898930,drives in the server presently
Ti8scviDiYc,898930,900639,[Laughter]
Ti8scviDiYc,900639,903920,i will not admit that i don't think or
Ti8scviDiYc,903920,905760,that didn't make sense i will not admit
Ti8scviDiYc,905760,907120,that i don't think
Ti8scviDiYc,907120,909120,i think that drive will die faster than
Ti8scviDiYc,909120,910320,the other ones
Ti8scviDiYc,910320,911519,that's nice
Ti8scviDiYc,911519,913839,but that wasn't the bet
Ti8scviDiYc,913839,917760,i'll buy you lunch whatever yes
Ti8scviDiYc,917920,920639,why would you do that it's fine it's
Ti8scviDiYc,920639,922320,fine don't touch it yet it's still
Ti8scviDiYc,922320,923839,spinning i'm letting it still spinning
Ti8scviDiYc,923839,925839,it's letting it spin wiggle wobbling
Ti8scviDiYc,925839,926880,barely
Ti8scviDiYc,926880,929759,i can't believe you bought a petabyte i
Ti8scviDiYc,929759,931199,can't believe you threw that hard drive
Ti8scviDiYc,931199,932480,can we just cut back to that for a
Ti8scviDiYc,932480,934720,second
Ti8scviDiYc,938560,941519,holy crap i can't believe you did that
Ti8scviDiYc,941519,942560,okay
Ti8scviDiYc,942560,945120,so we want some pretty chunk-tastic
Ti8scviDiYc,945120,948079,raid zenis i'm figuring maybe not
Ti8scviDiYc,948079,950320,15-drive v-dabs like we do i was
Ti8scviDiYc,950320,953920,thinking to do 10-drive z2s or i mean
Ti8scviDiYc,953920,955360,for like performance apparently the
Ti8scviDiYc,955360,957759,optimal is six drives but that's a lot
Ti8scviDiYc,957759,960720,of capacity loss yeah we'd have to do
Ti8scviDiYc,960720,962480,z1s at that point and i really don't
Ti8scviDiYc,962480,964800,want to do that so raid z2
Ti8scviDiYc,964800,967600,is kind of like raid 6 where you can
Ti8scviDiYc,967600,969440,lose two of your drives before you
Ti8scviDiYc,969440,972240,actually lose any data but it means that
Ti8scviDiYc,972240,975199,two drives out of whatever the v dev
Ti8scviDiYc,975199,977519,size you have are lost in terms of
Ti8scviDiYc,977519,980959,capacity so raid z1
Ti8scviDiYc,980959,982959,sets aside only one of those drives for
Ti8scviDiYc,982959,984880,parity data but that means you can only
Ti8scviDiYc,984880,987360,sustain one loss before your next loss
Ti8scviDiYc,987360,990560,is going to cost you data so for dream
Ti8scviDiYc,990560,992800,you're thinking 10 well hold on i just
Ti8scviDiYc,992800,996399,realized we want to have some hot spares
Ti8scviDiYc,996399,998000,we don't want ten why don't we do this
Ti8scviDiYc,998000,1000240,why don't we do four hot spares one for
Ti8scviDiYc,1000240,1002480,each bank and then and then we can do
Ti8scviDiYc,1002480,1004800,seven drive v dams
Ti8scviDiYc,1004800,1006560,upgrade z2 we're gonna lose a lot of
Ti8scviDiYc,1006560,1007920,capacity
Ti8scviDiYc,1007920,1011040,why don't we go 14 drive v devs then
Ti8scviDiYc,1011040,1012639,raid z3
Ti8scviDiYc,1012639,1015440,so that would allow three drives lost
Ti8scviDiYc,1015440,1016320,per
Ti8scviDiYc,1016320,1017920,one of these rows
Ti8scviDiYc,1017920,1020079,sure with a spare okay so if we do raid
Ti8scviDiYc,1020079,1022480,z3s 14 drives we get 800 terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,1022480,1024240,usable i'm about to blow your mind how
Ti8scviDiYc,1024240,1025839,much is each of these drives worth uh
Ti8scviDiYc,1025839,1028000,like 600 six six hundred that's like six
Ti8scviDiYc,1028000,1030558,hundred bucks six hundred dollars okay
Ti8scviDiYc,1030558,1032400,let's do some quick math real quick here
Ti8scviDiYc,1032400,1034480,okay six hundred twelve hundred twenty
Ti8scviDiYc,1034480,1036558,four hundred okay
Ti8scviDiYc,1036558,1040558,five thousand ten thousand ten thousand
Ti8scviDiYc,1040558,1043520,dollars worth of drives is sitting doing
Ti8scviDiYc,1043520,1046400,nothing there will be no data actually
Ti8scviDiYc,1046400,1049360,stored on them okay they're just holding
Ti8scviDiYc,1049360,1052480,data just in case these ones fail
Ti8scviDiYc,1052480,1055200,or standing there ready to go in case
Ti8scviDiYc,1055200,1057600,these fail 10 grand that level of
Ti8scviDiYc,1057600,1059919,redundancy costs in a server like this
Ti8scviDiYc,1059919,1061120,look at all this
Ti8scviDiYc,1061120,1063679,big data big data you're going to set it
Ti8scviDiYc,1063679,1066880,to be an smb share
Ti8scviDiYc,1066880,1068640,we're gonna go into advance i'm gonna do
Ti8scviDiYc,1068640,1070640,z standard compression because it's
Ti8scviDiYc,1070640,1072080,really great
Ti8scviDiYc,1072080,1074160,record size of one mag because it's all
Ti8scviDiYc,1074160,1077280,footage bam now we can store stuff big
Ti8scviDiYc,1077280,1080320,data so it works out to be 740 tera tibi
Ti8scviDiYc,1080320,1082400,bytes usable after formatting that's a
Ti8scviDiYc,1082400,1084960,big data all right let's do the nvme
Ti8scviDiYc,1084960,1085919,we're going to do it pretty similar to
Ti8scviDiYc,1085919,1087520,the petabyte server where we have a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1087520,1089280,spare but we're just doing one and it's
Ti8scviDiYc,1089280,1091440,a raid z2 which means we have two disks
Ti8scviDiYc,1091440,1094160,of parity that is so overkill it is with
Ti8scviDiYc,1094160,1096160,a hot spirit do you want to get a phone
Ti8scviDiYc,1096160,1098480,call hold on the problem with ssds hear
Ti8scviDiYc,1098480,1100400,me out the problem with ssds they're not
Ti8scviDiYc,1100400,1101600,like hard drives where they kind of
Ti8scviDiYc,1101600,1103440,staggered fail usually when you have
Ti8scviDiYc,1103440,1105440,like 20 ssds and they're all from the
Ti8scviDiYc,1105440,1107120,same batch they'll just start failing at
Ti8scviDiYc,1107120,1108320,the same time because they're so much
Ti8scviDiYc,1108320,1111440,more dependent on like right endurance
Ti8scviDiYc,1111440,1114720,it's better to be safer he's got 100 tv
Ti8scviDiYc,1114720,1116720,bites that's so much that's that's more
Ti8scviDiYc,1116720,1120160,than we have i know but this is like
Ti8scviDiYc,1120160,1121440,90
Ti8scviDiYc,1121440,1122559,terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,1122559,1126160,of ssd storage just
Ti8scviDiYc,1126160,1128880,not being used well it's being used jake
Ti8scviDiYc,1128880,1131679,i think it's fine raid z1 and a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1131679,1133120,spare
Ti8scviDiYc,1133120,1134240,i
Ti8scviDiYc,1134240,1136960,know their enterprise drives he's barely
Ti8scviDiYc,1136960,1138480,going to touch these compared to the
Ti8scviDiYc,1138480,1140480,workloads they're designed for you're
Ti8scviDiYc,1140480,1142240,you know i'm looking around i see
Ti8scviDiYc,1142240,1145600,wendell like through the camera
Ti8scviDiYc,1146799,1149360,hey there mr wilson it's me linus the
Ti8scviDiYc,1149360,1151440,menace
Ti8scviDiYc,1151440,1153360,well jake and i are having a bit of a
Ti8scviDiYc,1153360,1155520,debate right now we've got seven of
Ti8scviDiYc,1155520,1158400,these 30 terabyte keyoxia drives and i'm
Ti8scviDiYc,1158400,1160559,not going to tell you who is in which
Ti8scviDiYc,1160559,1163200,position so that you're unbiased but
Ti8scviDiYc,1163200,1166160,there are two potential configurations
Ti8scviDiYc,1166160,1169039,for them in in true nas here um are you
Ti8scviDiYc,1169039,1171120,willing to weigh in on on which one you
Ti8scviDiYc,1171120,1173360,think is proper
Ti8scviDiYc,1173360,1175360,one of us wants to do
Ti8scviDiYc,1175360,1178960,a raid z2 with a hot spare and one of us
Ti8scviDiYc,1178960,1182160,wants to do a raid z1 with a hot spare i
Ti8scviDiYc,1182160,1183760,would probably do
Ti8scviDiYc,1183760,1186480,everything honestly
Ti8scviDiYc,1186480,1188559,a little bit more
Ti8scviDiYc,1188559,1191360,it's a little bit more dangerous
Ti8scviDiYc,1191360,1194400,um but those drives are so fast
Ti8scviDiYc,1194400,1196559,and if you're on top of it
Ti8scviDiYc,1196559,1198000,it's probably okay but what if they're
Ti8scviDiYc,1198000,1200400,not on top of it if you're not on top of
Ti8scviDiYc,1200400,1201919,it then you gotta go
Ti8scviDiYc,1201919,1203760,do you really think it's likely that
Ti8scviDiYc,1203760,1205280,we're gonna hit these drives hard enough
Ti8scviDiYc,1205280,1206720,that we should be concerned about their
Ti8scviDiYc,1206720,1208799,lifespan if you get a hot spare on the
Ti8scviDiYc,1208799,1211600,flash side i would probably just
Ti8scviDiYc,1211600,1213360,make it raise d2 instead of having a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1213360,1214240,spare
Ti8scviDiYc,1214240,1216000,only because flash wears differently
Ti8scviDiYc,1216000,1218640,than mechanical hard drives now okay so
Ti8scviDiYc,1218640,1221039,what about a raid z2 and a hot spare oh
Ti8scviDiYc,1221039,1223280,my god jake okay all right let's just go
Ti8scviDiYc,1223280,1225360,raid z2 then with seven drives we need
Ti8scviDiYc,1225360,1226880,to put some footage on this thing nice
Ti8scviDiYc,1226880,1228480,it's going through my workstation so
Ti8scviDiYc,1228480,1230400,it's not going to be that fast wow even
Ti8scviDiYc,1230400,1232240,through your workstation it's doing 400
Ti8scviDiYc,1232240,1234480,plus megabytes a second
Ti8scviDiYc,1234480,1237520,you know what i should go jump onto mine
Ti8scviDiYc,1237520,1239039,and hit it at the same time and see if
Ti8scviDiYc,1239039,1241200,that even goes down i bet it won't
Ti8scviDiYc,1241200,1243120,the bottleneck is going to be your
Ti8scviDiYc,1243120,1246640,your station not this machine okay well
Ti8scviDiYc,1246640,1248320,i'm still copying at
Ti8scviDiYc,1248320,1250720,400 to 450 megabytes a second how about
Ti8scviDiYc,1250720,1253120,you okay you ready for me to press go oh
Ti8scviDiYc,1253120,1254880,you haven't pressed go yet okay i
Ti8scviDiYc,1254880,1258159,already did yeah that's what i figured
Ti8scviDiYc,1259360,1260640,yeah the one thing to consider is
Ti8scviDiYc,1260640,1263280,because we're copying like a folder full
Ti8scviDiYc,1263280,1265440,of a bunch of little files windows will
Ti8scviDiYc,1265440,1267200,never really get there because it's like
Ti8scviDiYc,1267200,1268720,starting stopping starting zapping
Ti8scviDiYc,1268720,1271440,starting stopping but that's still super
Ti8scviDiYc,1271440,1273600,awesome this is really important just
Ti8scviDiYc,1273600,1274840,because we have
Ti8scviDiYc,1274840,1278000,redundancy okay so we have that extra
Ti8scviDiYc,1278000,1280080,couple of drives that can fail
Ti8scviDiYc,1280080,1282960,doesn't mean that we have backup
Ti8scviDiYc,1282960,1284480,so if this is where they're going to
Ti8scviDiYc,1284480,1286640,store their active projects then if
Ti8scviDiYc,1286640,1289120,something were to go wrong let's say
Ti8scviDiYc,1289120,1291440,uh a power supply blue i mean
Ti8scviDiYc,1291440,1293760,theoretically those are
Ti8scviDiYc,1293760,1295919,also redundant so you could just you
Ti8scviDiYc,1295919,1297360,could just yank one in the middle of
Ti8scviDiYc,1297360,1299200,operation but let's say it blew in such
Ti8scviDiYc,1299200,1301520,a catastrophic way that it lit on fire
Ti8scviDiYc,1301520,1303360,okay the server is dead but somehow the
Ti8scviDiYc,1303360,1305360,fire doesn't spread outside the steel
Ti8scviDiYc,1305360,1306799,chassis and light the other server on
Ti8scviDiYc,1306799,1308880,fire we need a backup
Ti8scviDiYc,1308880,1311360,that backup is gonna go automatically
Ti8scviDiYc,1311360,1313679,from this server to this one
Ti8scviDiYc,1313679,1315520,unfortunately eating up some of our
Ti8scviDiYc,1315520,1317600,capacity but not that much it's gonna be
Ti8scviDiYc,1317600,1319919,incremental so but each time it backs up
Ti8scviDiYc,1319919,1321679,it's it's keeping what's already on
Ti8scviDiYc,1321679,1323440,there and just adding the new stuff yes
Ti8scviDiYc,1323440,1325200,and it will cycle automatically so we
Ti8scviDiYc,1325200,1327120,can set it so it keeps like a daily
Ti8scviDiYc,1327120,1329200,backup uh for two weeks and it
Ti8scviDiYc,1329200,1330799,automatically deletes the old ones when
Ti8scviDiYc,1330799,1332559,it makes the new ones and doesn't store
Ti8scviDiYc,1332559,1333919,a bunch on here
Ti8scviDiYc,1333919,1335360,and then as soon as they delete
Ti8scviDiYc,1335360,1337840,something from here that will eventually
Ti8scviDiYc,1337840,1339840,fade out of those daily or weekly
Ti8scviDiYc,1339840,1343200,backups until the only copy that exists
Ti8scviDiYc,1343200,1345440,is the archival copy which
Ti8scviDiYc,1345440,1348240,like us dream has said is not
Ti8scviDiYc,1348240,1351039,super essential it's a nice to have not
Ti8scviDiYc,1351039,1353039,a need to have because you can always go
Ti8scviDiYc,1353039,1354480,re-download it off of youtube if it
Ti8scviDiYc,1354480,1356240,comes to that that's your off-site
Ti8scviDiYc,1356240,1359280,backup essentially thanks youtube okay i
Ti8scviDiYc,1359280,1361200,started the backup it's backing up from
Ti8scviDiYc,1361200,1363120,this server
Ti8scviDiYc,1363120,1365679,over to this server and it's running at
Ti8scviDiYc,1365679,1368159,400 megabytes a second i mean that's a
Ti8scviDiYc,1368159,1370000,lot of data
Ti8scviDiYc,1370000,1371440,you could probably get it to go faster
Ti8scviDiYc,1371440,1374000,by disabling like secure ciphers on ssh
Ti8scviDiYc,1374000,1375520,but right now we just have it in the
Ti8scviDiYc,1375520,1377039,default configuration just to show that
Ti8scviDiYc,1377039,1378960,it works and since by default this is
Ti8scviDiYc,1378960,1381200,only going to be a daily backup it's got
Ti8scviDiYc,1381200,1383840,24 hours to move whatever is on here
Ti8scviDiYc,1383840,1385760,that's plenty enough if you guys enjoyed
Ti8scviDiYc,1385760,1387840,this video check out kyoccia's products
Ti8scviDiYc,1387840,1389440,they've got everything from enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,1389440,1391679,to consumer grade ssd products we're
Ti8scviDiYc,1391679,1393760,gonna have them linked down below also
Ti8scviDiYc,1393760,1395760,major shout out to gigabyte who sent
Ti8scviDiYc,1395760,1397360,over the wrong server but they did send
Ti8scviDiYc,1397360,1399840,a server so kudos for that micron for
Ti8scviDiYc,1399840,1402000,sending over the ram amd for providing
Ti8scviDiYc,1402000,1403520,the cpu that we couldn't use thanks
Ti8scviDiYc,1403520,1406799,gigabyte um and also 45 drives for
Ti8scviDiYc,1406799,1409840,sending over this epic storinator that
Ti8scviDiYc,1409840,1412240,happens to color match the green tabs on
Ti8scviDiYc,1412240,1414640,oh wow and with the dream front plate
Ti8scviDiYc,1414640,1416000,they can do like literally anything
Ti8scviDiYc,1416000,1418080,custom you want yeah it looks amazing
Ti8scviDiYc,1418080,1419919,if you guys enjoyed this video go check
Ti8scviDiYc,1419919,1421279,out uh i don't know one of the other
Ti8scviDiYc,1421279,1422480,times jake and i worked on a server
Ti8scviDiYc,1422480,1423840,thing he'll find something petabyte of
Ti8scviDiYc,1423840,1425360,flash yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,1425360,1427039,oh yeah we need to get back going we
Ti8scviDiYc,1427039,1428960,gotta finish that but jake is too busy
Ti8scviDiYc,1428960,1430640,helping me with my house he moved in
Ti8scviDiYc,1430640,1434720,early he's an in-demand kind of boy
vid,start,end,text
Ti8scviDiYc,0,1599,when dream needed a server that could
Ti8scviDiYc,1599,4560,store unlimited gameplay footage with a
Ti8scviDiYc,4560,6640,matching budget he knew there was only
Ti8scviDiYc,6640,9440,one place to go yo
Ti8scviDiYc,9440,11120,and we're going to be building it in
Ti8scviDiYc,11120,13120,true dream fashion that's right we're
Ti8scviDiYc,13120,15120,going to be speed running the creation
Ti8scviDiYc,15120,18560,of a 1.2 petabyte hard drive storage
Ti8scviDiYc,18560,24160,server with a 200 terabyte all nvme ssd
Ti8scviDiYc,24160,26480,server all we need is a little bit of
Ti8scviDiYc,26480,29480,help
Ti8scviDiYc,31359,33280,all right i think we're going for a
Ti8scviDiYc,33280,35440,world record here guys kyogsi has
Ti8scviDiYc,35440,37600,sponsored the ssd so that's taken care
Ti8scviDiYc,37600,39680,of 45 drives practically built the
Ti8scviDiYc,39680,41840,server for us and you guys are all here
Ti8scviDiYc,41840,44239,to witness it starting with the big face
Ti8scviDiYc,44239,46960,reveal you ready
Ti8scviDiYc,46960,48559,okay it's more of a faceplate but look
Ti8scviDiYc,48559,52760,it's a really cool one it has dream on
Ti8scviDiYc,55380,59840,[Music]
Ti8scviDiYc,59840,62480,let's go jakey oh jesus oh server to
Ti8scviDiYc,62480,64080,build your voice oh this is a lot of
Ti8scviDiYc,64080,66240,drives to shuck because the servers for
Ti8scviDiYc,66240,67920,dream some of the hardware did end up
Ti8scviDiYc,67920,70080,getting sent to us but the hard drives
Ti8scviDiYc,70080,72080,were not one of those things meaning
Ti8scviDiYc,72080,75200,that yes my friends dream actually did
Ti8scviDiYc,75200,76880,shell out for
Ti8scviDiYc,76880,79119,60 the full
Ti8scviDiYc,79119,80200,60
Ti8scviDiYc,80200,83280,20 terabyte hard drives that's going to
Ti8scviDiYc,83280,86320,be a total of 1.2 petabytes of raw
Ti8scviDiYc,86320,88000,storage which should work out to
Ti8scviDiYc,88000,89840,somewhere in the neighborhood of one
Ti8scviDiYc,89840,91920,petabyte of usable storage when we're
Ti8scviDiYc,91920,93119,done here i think we're going to play
Ti8scviDiYc,93119,94479,this one a little bit safer i'll put
Ti8scviDiYc,94479,95840,some hot spare so it might be more like
Ti8scviDiYc,95840,98320,900 okay sure that's fair enough i don't
Ti8scviDiYc,98320,99840,want to get a tech support call
Ti8scviDiYc,99840,101759,realistically from like wherever the
Ti8scviDiYc,101759,104079,crap dream is from the server hardware
Ti8scviDiYc,104079,106159,itself was provided by 45 drives and
Ti8scviDiYc,106159,108399,this is their turbo tier server it's got
Ti8scviDiYc,108399,112960,a 26 core xeon gold 512 gigs of ddr4
Ti8scviDiYc,112960,114720,memory which we'll be using as a zfs
Ti8scviDiYc,114720,118000,read cache we've got four lsi hbas which
Ti8scviDiYc,118000,119920,are allowing us to hook up all of these
Ti8scviDiYc,119920,122320,freaking drives and
Ti8scviDiYc,122320,124560,we actually got them to send
Ti8scviDiYc,124560,126520,a dual port
Ti8scviDiYc,126520,130640,25 gigabit per second network card which
Ti8scviDiYc,130640,133200,um sorry 45 drives we're actually going
Ti8scviDiYc,133200,135280,to steal from this server and put in the
Ti8scviDiYc,135280,137599,ssd server and there is a reason for
Ti8scviDiYc,137599,139040,this
Ti8scviDiYc,139040,141280,the fancy switch hey i need more drives
Ti8scviDiYc,141280,143440,jake hold on shut up world record the
Ti8scviDiYc,143440,145680,fancy switch that ubiquity sent happens
Ti8scviDiYc,145680,146800,to have
Ti8scviDiYc,146800,148879,two 25 gig ports so i'm thinking we put
Ti8scviDiYc,148879,151120,them together aggregate 50 gig to the
Ti8scviDiYc,151120,152319,storage server
Ti8scviDiYc,152319,153920,wow it's probably excessive but we're
Ti8scviDiYc,153920,155519,gonna do it anyways honestly though
Ti8scviDiYc,155519,157519,outside of our own server room he is
Ti8scviDiYc,157519,159120,getting the
Ti8scviDiYc,159120,162160,finest storage setup out of probably
Ti8scviDiYc,162160,164080,anyone else on youtube or twitch by the
Ti8scviDiYc,164080,166239,way jake can i just shout you out for
Ti8scviDiYc,166239,168000,putting these in exactly the correct
Ti8scviDiYc,168000,170319,orientation for me to just am i slot
Ti8scviDiYc,170319,171680,them right in are you being sarcastic
Ti8scviDiYc,171680,173360,are you not trying to no no i was
Ti8scviDiYc,173360,175280,actually no it's like the most ergonomic
Ti8scviDiYc,175280,176640,thing ever i just grabbed them and put
Ti8scviDiYc,176640,177840,them in okay i'll be sure to do it the
Ti8scviDiYc,177840,181120,other way now oh you piece of crap
Ti8scviDiYc,181120,184000,why did i say anything i was not trying
Ti8scviDiYc,184000,185760,at all it just happened to be how they
Ti8scviDiYc,185760,188080,were getting pulled out that's it are we
Ti8scviDiYc,188080,189159,done
Ti8scviDiYc,189159,191840,1.2 petabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,191840,193120,you know it's not that fun when it's
Ti8scviDiYc,193120,196319,this easy what i mean it's i'm now i'm
Ti8scviDiYc,196319,197440,still into it
Ti8scviDiYc,197440,199360,we haven't found out if it works yet so
Ti8scviDiYc,199360,202000,we're replacing this dual 25 gigabit
Ti8scviDiYc,202000,204879,nick with this dual 10 gigabit nick and
Ti8scviDiYc,204879,207120,the reason we're doing that is that i
Ti8scviDiYc,207120,209360,mean they're hard drives realistically
Ti8scviDiYc,209360,211680,if we manage to get you know what 20
Ti8scviDiYc,211680,214400,gigabit trunks so two gigabytes a second
Ti8scviDiYc,214400,216799,out of it that'll be fine i mean it'll
Ti8scviDiYc,216799,218640,just it'll do a lot more than that but
Ti8scviDiYc,218640,220400,you're just using this for archives so
Ti8scviDiYc,220400,221200,yes
Ti8scviDiYc,221200,223280,well yes and no i think it's possible
Ti8scviDiYc,223280,225040,that they could end up editing partially
Ti8scviDiYc,225040,226319,off of it if they were working on a
Ti8scviDiYc,226319,227920,project it'll have plenty for that
Ti8scviDiYc,227920,229599,called back from you know a previous
Ti8scviDiYc,229599,231920,video or something along those lines
Ti8scviDiYc,231920,233200,come on
Ti8scviDiYc,233200,235599,jake what
Ti8scviDiYc,235599,238080,what was the ergonomic rationale behind
Ti8scviDiYc,238080,240239,putting this server here i'm not saying
Ti8scviDiYc,240239,241680,you're wrong i'm just saying i don't see
Ti8scviDiYc,241680,243200,how you're right are you complaining
Ti8scviDiYc,243200,246400,because you're short no
Ti8scviDiYc,246480,248159,i'm complaining because tall people
Ti8scviDiYc,248159,251120,don't consider my short person needs
Ti8scviDiYc,251120,252840,that's what i'm complaining about right
Ti8scviDiYc,252840,255519,right very important distinction
Ti8scviDiYc,255519,257440,unlike the petabyte of hard drive based
Ti8scviDiYc,257440,261359,storage this one actually
Ti8scviDiYc,261600,263199,is going to have a ton of room for
Ti8scviDiYc,263199,266560,expansion and that is thanks to
Ti8scviDiYc,266560,270080,high density drives like the cm6 from
Ti8scviDiYc,270080,272400,kyogre these puppies are available in up
Ti8scviDiYc,272400,275680,to what 15.3 terabytes of top this is a
Ti8scviDiYc,275680,278560,30 terabyte what shut up it's not not
Ti8scviDiYc,278560,280960,only is it a 30 terabyte ssd it's a 30
Ti8scviDiYc,280960,286560,terabyte tlc ssd it's not even qlc
Ti8scviDiYc,286800,288960,these are crazy kiosks just sent these
Ti8scviDiYc,288960,292000,for dream where's mine well they sent 15
Ti8scviDiYc,292000,293360,for dream and i was like yeah we'll just
Ti8scviDiYc,293360,296240,give them like seven oh really yeah it's
Ti8scviDiYc,296240,298080,not like he paid for them yeah that
Ti8scviDiYc,298080,300000,still means he's gonna end up with 120
Ti8scviDiYc,300000,302080,terabytes of usable space with two
Ti8scviDiYc,302080,306400,parity drives and a hot spare
Ti8scviDiYc,306639,308720,wrap your brain around it right
Ti8scviDiYc,308720,311039,this is the state of the art i mean i
Ti8scviDiYc,311039,313840,think they're looking at what 22 to 26
Ti8scviDiYc,313840,315440,in the next year and those aren't even
Ti8scviDiYc,315440,317919,conventional those are shingles exactly
Ti8scviDiYc,317919,321120,this has 50 more capacity than this
Ti8scviDiYc,321120,323440,in a fraction of the size mind you it's
Ti8scviDiYc,323440,324639,probably
Ti8scviDiYc,324639,327039,quite literally 20 times the cost not to
Ti8scviDiYc,327039,329759,mention this is pcie gen 4
Ti8scviDiYc,329759,331680,these will do almost 7 gigabytes a
Ti8scviDiYc,331680,335280,second read on a single drive
Ti8scviDiYc,336160,337840,and that's why we're keeping some yes
Ti8scviDiYc,337840,339199,you should okay so we're gonna do a four
Ti8scviDiYc,339199,343440,node actually wait the what oh my oh my
Ti8scviDiYc,343440,347039,god oh my god how do you do that you
Ti8scviDiYc,347039,347919,just
Ti8scviDiYc,347919,349440,literally
Ti8scviDiYc,349440,351280,holy
Ti8scviDiYc,351280,355120,oh my god oh my god oh my god did i put
Ti8scviDiYc,355120,357039,it back are you
Ti8scviDiYc,357039,358400,kidding me
Ti8scviDiYc,358400,359440,dude
Ti8scviDiYc,359440,363520,what's the actual is wrong with you
Ti8scviDiYc,363520,365360,oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,365360,369280,oh oh i want to throw up i really
Ti8scviDiYc,369280,371120,oh
Ti8scviDiYc,371120,374880,do you think it still works no
Ti8scviDiYc,374880,376240,did you hear the
Ti8scviDiYc,376240,379199,noise in me well it's a pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,379199,381280,it's a pretty bouncy floor
Ti8scviDiYc,381280,382720,okay the video's done i'm leaving
Ti8scviDiYc,382720,384639,goodbye
Ti8scviDiYc,384639,387520,it might still work
Ti8scviDiYc,387520,391870,okay lunch says it still works
Ti8scviDiYc,391870,394000,[Laughter]
Ti8scviDiYc,394000,396639,you know it might actually still work
Ti8scviDiYc,396639,398880,here's the thing i've actually talked to
Ti8scviDiYc,398880,400960,seagate engineers about the kind of drop
Ti8scviDiYc,400960,402319,testing that they do on these things
Ti8scviDiYc,402319,404240,there's a solid chance that thing still
Ti8scviDiYc,404240,405440,works
Ti8scviDiYc,405440,408240,what happened what nothing you talking
Ti8scviDiYc,408240,410720,no no i was just saying that uh you're a
Ti8scviDiYc,410720,413120,fine young man and i'm really proud of
Ti8scviDiYc,413120,415199,the way you've turned out
Ti8scviDiYc,415199,416560,i'm not proud of the way you've turned
Ti8scviDiYc,416560,417599,out
Ti8scviDiYc,417599,420080,this is pretty gorgeous this is the new
Ti8scviDiYc,420080,422000,version of the one we have right yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,422000,425199,that's specifically designed for epic
Ti8scviDiYc,425199,428880,milan so that's a 32 core 75 43p so
Ti8scviDiYc,428880,432800,single single processor it boosts to 3.8
Ti8scviDiYc,432800,435199,gigahertz i think so not quite as good
Ti8scviDiYc,435199,438720,as the 75 f3 yeah but that's pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,438720,440960,freaking incredible this thing is gonna
Ti8scviDiYc,440960,442639,rip are you putting the ram in are you
Ti8scviDiYc,442639,444000,gonna talk about the ram at all i'm just
Ti8scviDiYc,444000,445360,gonna put it in really we're speed
Ti8scviDiYc,445360,449120,running okay well it's gonna be 512 gigs
Ti8scviDiYc,449120,452000,of ram nope what 128 128 that's it
Ti8scviDiYc,452000,453680,they're eight gig dimms these are from
Ti8scviDiYc,453680,455360,the one million dollar pc that we didn't
Ti8scviDiYc,455360,459120,use right microns sent us literally like
Ti8scviDiYc,459120,462160,flats 96. flats
Ti8scviDiYc,462160,465199,of these eight gig ecc 3200 modules
Ti8scviDiYc,465199,467199,they're fast yep they're exactly what
Ti8scviDiYc,467199,469199,you want just not the capacity that you
Ti8scviDiYc,469199,471280,want but for this for you it's perfect
Ti8scviDiYc,471280,472639,because we're not using ram caching
Ti8scviDiYc,472639,474400,since they're nvme drives you don't need
Ti8scviDiYc,474400,476879,that for zfs but he's gonna get 128 gigs
Ti8scviDiYc,476879,479840,anyway so we just want a nice fast cpu
Ti8scviDiYc,479840,482560,which for epic high speed memory is
Ti8scviDiYc,482560,484000,really important
Ti8scviDiYc,484000,486160,and then we're basically not going to
Ti8scviDiYc,486160,488080,hit this at all yeah i mean stuff will
Ti8scviDiYc,488080,490080,go through it but that's it that's
Ti8scviDiYc,490080,493840,pretty much it 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53
Ti8scviDiYc,493840,496879,54 55 36 57 58 59
Ti8scviDiYc,496879,498720,that's it shut up it does not there's
Ti8scviDiYc,498720,500879,only 59 yeah because it starts at zero
Ti8scviDiYc,500879,502240,oh hold on there might be 60 actually
Ti8scviDiYc,502240,504080,hold on it starts at zero doesn't it it
Ti8scviDiYc,504080,506479,might start at zero might be okay that
Ti8scviDiYc,506479,508000,it does are you screen recording there's
Ti8scviDiYc,508000,510240,the moment yeah i'm not screen recording
Ti8scviDiYc,510240,512479,but it does start at zero there is 60.
Ti8scviDiYc,512479,513919,that doesn't necessarily mean one of
Ti8scviDiYc,513919,516800,them isn't completely buggered okay
Ti8scviDiYc,516800,519440,cooler time yeah wow this is a
Ti8scviDiYc,519440,521360,beefy cooler for a two years yeah the
Ti8scviDiYc,521360,523518,nice thing about a 2u is you get
Ti8scviDiYc,523518,525200,double the cooler capacity which means
Ti8scviDiYc,525200,527200,your fans get to spin a lot slower yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,527200,528640,which is going to be good for at your
Ti8scviDiYc,528640,529440,house
Ti8scviDiYc,529440,532000,yeah one user like we're using a similar
Ti8scviDiYc,532000,534000,machine to this at my place right yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,534000,536240,okay just a less cool one oh really so
Ti8scviDiYc,536240,537680,dream's going to have a better server
Ti8scviDiYc,537680,539519,than me yeah i'm feeling pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,539519,541920,inadequate right now i love these
Ti8scviDiYc,541920,544240,tool-less sleds man when i built the
Ti8scviDiYc,544240,547920,first nvme wanik it took frickin forever
Ti8scviDiYc,547920,549519,and i didn't even put all the screws in
Ti8scviDiYc,549519,552160,oh these are so much easier to deal i
Ti8scviDiYc,552160,553600,can't believe
Ti8scviDiYc,553600,556320,that every one of these is 30 freaking
Ti8scviDiYc,556320,559200,terabytes i just installed 60 terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,559200,562480,of ssd storage hold on here comes number
Ti8scviDiYc,562480,563680,90
Ti8scviDiYc,563680,567040,90. like freaking what i mean we do have
Ti8scviDiYc,567040,569760,more we can put more they're dense yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,569760,571279,they're i was going to grab one of the
Ti8scviDiYc,571279,573279,cd6s which are like the not enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,573279,576080,ones um they are substantially heavier
Ti8scviDiYc,576080,578560,these things are dense as here david
Ti8scviDiYc,578560,579519,catch
Ti8scviDiYc,579519,581680,i don't know i know hold on a second no
Ti8scviDiYc,581680,584399,i want to i want to open it what no yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,584399,587360,no yeah chill jesus just relax what's
Ti8scviDiYc,587360,588800,the worst that can happen i lose the
Ti8scviDiYc,588800,592320,screws and we can't put it back together
Ti8scviDiYc,594160,598399,it's got a multi pcb design oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,598399,601040,of course it does oh my god these caps
Ti8scviDiYc,601040,602959,though that's gonna be the difference
Ti8scviDiYc,602959,605040,these are their actual enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,605040,607440,capacity they're willing to say it's
Ti8scviDiYc,607440,608959,enterprise
Ti8scviDiYc,608959,611120,this is for power loss protection these
Ti8scviDiYc,611120,614480,capacitors ensure that if any data is
Ti8scviDiYc,614480,616640,sitting in a cache or in a dram cache
Ti8scviDiYc,616640,619440,for example it can be flushed to nand
Ti8scviDiYc,619440,621760,before the drive actually powers down
Ti8scviDiYc,621760,623600,even in the event of a sudden power loss
Ti8scviDiYc,623600,626000,to the server that's freaking cool and
Ti8scviDiYc,626000,627200,those are
Ti8scviDiYc,627200,630160,huge look at the little holes
Ti8scviDiYc,630160,633200,wait they have cooling for the caps
Ti8scviDiYc,633200,634800,that's amazing
Ti8scviDiYc,634800,637519,wow i'm so happy right now that's so
Ti8scviDiYc,637519,639680,much nan how much nand is that man hold
Ti8scviDiYc,639680,641600,on we gotta find more nand we're going
Ti8scviDiYc,641600,643760,on a we're going on a voyage oh there's
Ti8scviDiYc,643760,645839,a clip there's a clip here no hold on
Ti8scviDiYc,645839,649120,hold on oh my god this is so cool oh i
Ti8scviDiYc,649120,650640,never get a chance to play with stuff
Ti8scviDiYc,650640,653760,like this god damn it
Ti8scviDiYc,654000,656880,there's another layer hold on so they
Ti8scviDiYc,656880,659279,got thermal pads between
Ti8scviDiYc,659279,660480,oh my god
Ti8scviDiYc,660480,662000,jake
Ti8scviDiYc,662000,664640,i think it's three layers
Ti8scviDiYc,664640,667839,jake no stop please stop hold on please
Ti8scviDiYc,667839,669440,please
Ti8scviDiYc,669440,670399,relay
Ti8scviDiYc,670399,672839,i can't do this i think it's three
Ti8scviDiYc,672839,675200,legs on how do we get this layer my
Ti8scviDiYc,675200,677160,heart there it goes
Ti8scviDiYc,677160,679440,holy balls
Ti8scviDiYc,679440,680800,it's got
Ti8scviDiYc,680800,681839,four
Ti8scviDiYc,681839,684079,dram cash dies what about that
Ti8scviDiYc,684079,687680,controller that thing is huge
Ti8scviDiYc,687680,689040,hold on here it goes here it goes here
Ti8scviDiYc,689040,691839,it goes oh
Ti8scviDiYc,691920,693120,ain't
Ti8scviDiYc,693120,695360,wait there's more
Ti8scviDiYc,695360,696880,gas
Ti8scviDiYc,696880,698800,well that's the thing is the higher
Ti8scviDiYc,698800,701920,capacity you go for your nan flash the
Ti8scviDiYc,701920,704399,more dram cash you need and if you're
Ti8scviDiYc,704399,707519,gonna have 30 freaking terabytes demand
Ti8scviDiYc,707519,709600,you're going to need a lot of dram eight
Ti8scviDiYc,709600,712079,gigabit one g by eight
Ti8scviDiYc,712079,713680,so it's one gig so it'd be eight gigs i
Ti8scviDiYc,713680,716959,guess eight gigs of flippin ram
Ti8scviDiYc,716959,720880,this ssd has as much as most people's
Ti8scviDiYc,720880,723040,gaming machines there's a new update i
Ti8scviDiYc,723040,724480,brought out the unify switch we were
Ti8scviDiYc,724480,726079,kind of originally thinking we might
Ti8scviDiYc,726079,727920,build a whole rack and send it to him
Ti8scviDiYc,727920,730399,but then apparently his like installers
Ti8scviDiYc,730399,732079,are doing a bunch of crap so we're just
Ti8scviDiYc,732079,733920,gonna give him the switch yeah this
Ti8scviDiYc,733920,736000,switch has two 25 gig ports that we're
Ti8scviDiYc,736000,738240,going to aggregate together to be 50 gig
Ti8scviDiYc,738240,740079,for nvme server totally probably
Ti8scviDiYc,740079,741440,overkill for what he's doing and then
Ti8scviDiYc,741440,743279,we're going to do two 10 gigs aggregated
Ti8scviDiYc,743279,745680,together for 20 gig to the hard drives
Ti8scviDiYc,745680,748399,then all these other ports are 10 gig to
Ti8scviDiYc,748399,750160,the rest of the house so that means if
Ti8scviDiYc,750160,752880,for whatever reason they expanded and
Ti8scviDiYc,752880,755200,had like a whole team of editors there
Ti8scviDiYc,755200,757760,they could have five people concurrently
Ti8scviDiYc,757760,760000,hitting this boy for 50 gigabits a
Ti8scviDiYc,760000,762240,second and this boy for 20 gigabits a
Ti8scviDiYc,762240,764560,second that is a lot of throughput for
Ti8scviDiYc,764560,766000,game play and if you really wanted you
Ti8scviDiYc,766000,767839,could switch this to a 4x10 card and
Ti8scviDiYc,767839,769360,then you could have 40 gig each editor
Ti8scviDiYc,769360,770959,will get its own 10 gigabits it's pretty
Ti8scviDiYc,770959,773440,sick it's a nice little switch ah you
Ti8scviDiYc,773440,774639,were gonna show me something cool
Ti8scviDiYc,774639,776240,there's a new view yeah hey look so they
Ti8scviDiYc,776240,778480,added this new port view so now instead
Ti8scviDiYc,778480,780480,of having to edit a port one by one you
Ti8scviDiYc,780480,781440,can go
Ti8scviDiYc,781440,783760,hey i wanna edit that one that one that
Ti8scviDiYc,783760,785760,one that one and maybe this one over
Ti8scviDiYc,785760,788639,here oh that's cool and you can set
Ti8scviDiYc,788639,791519,bam i only want this now security-minded
Ti8scviDiYc,791519,794160,folks might put mac address like limits
Ti8scviDiYc,794160,796240,so only that one mac address can connect
Ti8scviDiYc,796240,798240,to that port it's a nice security thing
Ti8scviDiYc,798240,799839,you can also see what device is
Ti8scviDiYc,799839,801279,connected to a specific port a lot
Ti8scviDiYc,801279,803440,easier so i can just click on it so i
Ti8scviDiYc,803440,805760,plug the bmc into that one port and then
Ti8scviDiYc,805760,806639,i just
Ti8scviDiYc,806639,808560,click on that there's the ip here's a
Ti8scviDiYc,808560,810320,cool feature for ubiquity it would be
Ti8scviDiYc,810320,812800,really nice to be able to take this go
Ti8scviDiYc,812800,815040,yes that's the device that i want and
Ti8scviDiYc,815040,816000,just
Ti8scviDiYc,816000,818079,set a rule that only that mac address
Ti8scviDiYc,818079,819680,can connect to that port just with one
Ti8scviDiYc,819680,821279,click here yeah if you just go like a
Ti8scviDiYc,821279,823920,limit yeah lock mac address lock that
Ti8scviDiYc,823920,825600,would be cool i bet they'll do it
Ti8scviDiYc,825600,826639,they're probably gonna watch this and
Ti8scviDiYc,826639,827519,they're probably going to do it yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,827519,830000,they might do it hey guess what it works
Ti8scviDiYc,830000,831839,now i got a vga cable because i thought
Ti8scviDiYc,831839,834320,the ipmi was broken turns out they
Ti8scviDiYc,834320,836800,screwed up i love you gigabyte but they
Ti8scviDiYc,836800,839440,sent a server that doesn't support milan
Ti8scviDiYc,839440,840720,chips no
Ti8scviDiYc,840720,843199,it's a roam server it's a roam server do
Ti8scviDiYc,843199,845279,we have any roam chips to we do so we
Ti8scviDiYc,845279,848720,had a 75 or 70 402 p which is a 24 core
Ti8scviDiYc,848720,850720,still going to be plenty
Ti8scviDiYc,850720,853120,for this yeah for the
Ti8scviDiYc,853120,855360,cut down drive configuration that we put
Ti8scviDiYc,855360,857440,in here anyway yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,857440,859120,okay it's gonna be great
Ti8scviDiYc,859120,861120,okay so now it'll actually be great yeah
Ti8scviDiYc,861120,862639,we're in truenast now on both of them
Ti8scviDiYc,862639,864399,we're gonna be using trinas core as much
Ti8scviDiYc,864399,866800,as i like scale core is a little more
Ti8scviDiYc,866800,869199,production ready yeah and we want this
Ti8scviDiYc,869199,870480,to just work and him not to have to
Ti8scviDiYc,870480,872560,screw with it and this is actually
Ti8scviDiYc,872560,874639,shockingly user friendly to use these
Ti8scviDiYc,874639,877519,days back in the early frenzy oh boy you
Ti8scviDiYc,877519,880000,had to kind of be nerdy enough that you
Ti8scviDiYc,880000,881600,could have basically done it yourself in
Ti8scviDiYc,881600,885120,linux anyway now man this gui is so
Ti8scviDiYc,885120,886800,pretty okay
Ti8scviDiYc,886800,888240,linem ti which one do you want to start
Ti8scviDiYc,888240,889839,with i want to start with the one that
Ti8scviDiYc,889839,892800,definitely has a working drive in this
Ti8scviDiYc,892800,894800,slot right here
Ti8scviDiYc,894800,897199,i will admit there are 60 functioning
Ti8scviDiYc,897199,898930,drives in the server presently
Ti8scviDiYc,898930,900639,[Laughter]
Ti8scviDiYc,900639,903920,i will not admit that i don't think or
Ti8scviDiYc,903920,905760,that didn't make sense i will not admit
Ti8scviDiYc,905760,907120,that i don't think
Ti8scviDiYc,907120,909120,i think that drive will die faster than
Ti8scviDiYc,909120,910320,the other ones
Ti8scviDiYc,910320,911519,that's nice
Ti8scviDiYc,911519,913839,but that wasn't the bet
Ti8scviDiYc,913839,917760,i'll buy you lunch whatever yes
Ti8scviDiYc,917920,920639,why would you do that it's fine it's
Ti8scviDiYc,920639,922320,fine don't touch it yet it's still
Ti8scviDiYc,922320,923839,spinning i'm letting it still spinning
Ti8scviDiYc,923839,925839,it's letting it spin wiggle wobbling
Ti8scviDiYc,925839,926880,barely
Ti8scviDiYc,926880,929759,i can't believe you bought a petabyte i
Ti8scviDiYc,929759,931199,can't believe you threw that hard drive
Ti8scviDiYc,931199,932480,can we just cut back to that for a
Ti8scviDiYc,932480,934720,second
Ti8scviDiYc,938560,941519,holy crap i can't believe you did that
Ti8scviDiYc,941519,942560,okay
Ti8scviDiYc,942560,945120,so we want some pretty chunk-tastic
Ti8scviDiYc,945120,948079,raid zenis i'm figuring maybe not
Ti8scviDiYc,948079,950320,15-drive v-dabs like we do i was
Ti8scviDiYc,950320,953920,thinking to do 10-drive z2s or i mean
Ti8scviDiYc,953920,955360,for like performance apparently the
Ti8scviDiYc,955360,957759,optimal is six drives but that's a lot
Ti8scviDiYc,957759,960720,of capacity loss yeah we'd have to do
Ti8scviDiYc,960720,962480,z1s at that point and i really don't
Ti8scviDiYc,962480,964800,want to do that so raid z2
Ti8scviDiYc,964800,967600,is kind of like raid 6 where you can
Ti8scviDiYc,967600,969440,lose two of your drives before you
Ti8scviDiYc,969440,972240,actually lose any data but it means that
Ti8scviDiYc,972240,975199,two drives out of whatever the v dev
Ti8scviDiYc,975199,977519,size you have are lost in terms of
Ti8scviDiYc,977519,980959,capacity so raid z1
Ti8scviDiYc,980959,982959,sets aside only one of those drives for
Ti8scviDiYc,982959,984880,parity data but that means you can only
Ti8scviDiYc,984880,987360,sustain one loss before your next loss
Ti8scviDiYc,987360,990560,is going to cost you data so for dream
Ti8scviDiYc,990560,992800,you're thinking 10 well hold on i just
Ti8scviDiYc,992800,996399,realized we want to have some hot spares
Ti8scviDiYc,996399,998000,we don't want ten why don't we do this
Ti8scviDiYc,998000,1000240,why don't we do four hot spares one for
Ti8scviDiYc,1000240,1002480,each bank and then and then we can do
Ti8scviDiYc,1002480,1004800,seven drive v dams
Ti8scviDiYc,1004800,1006560,upgrade z2 we're gonna lose a lot of
Ti8scviDiYc,1006560,1007920,capacity
Ti8scviDiYc,1007920,1011040,why don't we go 14 drive v devs then
Ti8scviDiYc,1011040,1012639,raid z3
Ti8scviDiYc,1012639,1015440,so that would allow three drives lost
Ti8scviDiYc,1015440,1016320,per
Ti8scviDiYc,1016320,1017920,one of these rows
Ti8scviDiYc,1017920,1020079,sure with a spare okay so if we do raid
Ti8scviDiYc,1020079,1022480,z3s 14 drives we get 800 terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,1022480,1024240,usable i'm about to blow your mind how
Ti8scviDiYc,1024240,1025839,much is each of these drives worth uh
Ti8scviDiYc,1025839,1028000,like 600 six six hundred that's like six
Ti8scviDiYc,1028000,1030558,hundred bucks six hundred dollars okay
Ti8scviDiYc,1030558,1032400,let's do some quick math real quick here
Ti8scviDiYc,1032400,1034480,okay six hundred twelve hundred twenty
Ti8scviDiYc,1034480,1036558,four hundred okay
Ti8scviDiYc,1036558,1040558,five thousand ten thousand ten thousand
Ti8scviDiYc,1040558,1043520,dollars worth of drives is sitting doing
Ti8scviDiYc,1043520,1046400,nothing there will be no data actually
Ti8scviDiYc,1046400,1049360,stored on them okay they're just holding
Ti8scviDiYc,1049360,1052480,data just in case these ones fail
Ti8scviDiYc,1052480,1055200,or standing there ready to go in case
Ti8scviDiYc,1055200,1057600,these fail 10 grand that level of
Ti8scviDiYc,1057600,1059919,redundancy costs in a server like this
Ti8scviDiYc,1059919,1061120,look at all this
Ti8scviDiYc,1061120,1063679,big data big data you're going to set it
Ti8scviDiYc,1063679,1066880,to be an smb share
Ti8scviDiYc,1066880,1068640,we're gonna go into advance i'm gonna do
Ti8scviDiYc,1068640,1070640,z standard compression because it's
Ti8scviDiYc,1070640,1072080,really great
Ti8scviDiYc,1072080,1074160,record size of one mag because it's all
Ti8scviDiYc,1074160,1077280,footage bam now we can store stuff big
Ti8scviDiYc,1077280,1080320,data so it works out to be 740 tera tibi
Ti8scviDiYc,1080320,1082400,bytes usable after formatting that's a
Ti8scviDiYc,1082400,1084960,big data all right let's do the nvme
Ti8scviDiYc,1084960,1085919,we're going to do it pretty similar to
Ti8scviDiYc,1085919,1087520,the petabyte server where we have a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1087520,1089280,spare but we're just doing one and it's
Ti8scviDiYc,1089280,1091440,a raid z2 which means we have two disks
Ti8scviDiYc,1091440,1094160,of parity that is so overkill it is with
Ti8scviDiYc,1094160,1096160,a hot spirit do you want to get a phone
Ti8scviDiYc,1096160,1098480,call hold on the problem with ssds hear
Ti8scviDiYc,1098480,1100400,me out the problem with ssds they're not
Ti8scviDiYc,1100400,1101600,like hard drives where they kind of
Ti8scviDiYc,1101600,1103440,staggered fail usually when you have
Ti8scviDiYc,1103440,1105440,like 20 ssds and they're all from the
Ti8scviDiYc,1105440,1107120,same batch they'll just start failing at
Ti8scviDiYc,1107120,1108320,the same time because they're so much
Ti8scviDiYc,1108320,1111440,more dependent on like right endurance
Ti8scviDiYc,1111440,1114720,it's better to be safer he's got 100 tv
Ti8scviDiYc,1114720,1116720,bites that's so much that's that's more
Ti8scviDiYc,1116720,1120160,than we have i know but this is like
Ti8scviDiYc,1120160,1121440,90
Ti8scviDiYc,1121440,1122559,terabytes
Ti8scviDiYc,1122559,1126160,of ssd storage just
Ti8scviDiYc,1126160,1128880,not being used well it's being used jake
Ti8scviDiYc,1128880,1131679,i think it's fine raid z1 and a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1131679,1133120,spare
Ti8scviDiYc,1133120,1134240,i
Ti8scviDiYc,1134240,1136960,know their enterprise drives he's barely
Ti8scviDiYc,1136960,1138480,going to touch these compared to the
Ti8scviDiYc,1138480,1140480,workloads they're designed for you're
Ti8scviDiYc,1140480,1142240,you know i'm looking around i see
Ti8scviDiYc,1142240,1145600,wendell like through the camera
Ti8scviDiYc,1146799,1149360,hey there mr wilson it's me linus the
Ti8scviDiYc,1149360,1151440,menace
Ti8scviDiYc,1151440,1153360,well jake and i are having a bit of a
Ti8scviDiYc,1153360,1155520,debate right now we've got seven of
Ti8scviDiYc,1155520,1158400,these 30 terabyte keyoxia drives and i'm
Ti8scviDiYc,1158400,1160559,not going to tell you who is in which
Ti8scviDiYc,1160559,1163200,position so that you're unbiased but
Ti8scviDiYc,1163200,1166160,there are two potential configurations
Ti8scviDiYc,1166160,1169039,for them in in true nas here um are you
Ti8scviDiYc,1169039,1171120,willing to weigh in on on which one you
Ti8scviDiYc,1171120,1173360,think is proper
Ti8scviDiYc,1173360,1175360,one of us wants to do
Ti8scviDiYc,1175360,1178960,a raid z2 with a hot spare and one of us
Ti8scviDiYc,1178960,1182160,wants to do a raid z1 with a hot spare i
Ti8scviDiYc,1182160,1183760,would probably do
Ti8scviDiYc,1183760,1186480,everything honestly
Ti8scviDiYc,1186480,1188559,a little bit more
Ti8scviDiYc,1188559,1191360,it's a little bit more dangerous
Ti8scviDiYc,1191360,1194400,um but those drives are so fast
Ti8scviDiYc,1194400,1196559,and if you're on top of it
Ti8scviDiYc,1196559,1198000,it's probably okay but what if they're
Ti8scviDiYc,1198000,1200400,not on top of it if you're not on top of
Ti8scviDiYc,1200400,1201919,it then you gotta go
Ti8scviDiYc,1201919,1203760,do you really think it's likely that
Ti8scviDiYc,1203760,1205280,we're gonna hit these drives hard enough
Ti8scviDiYc,1205280,1206720,that we should be concerned about their
Ti8scviDiYc,1206720,1208799,lifespan if you get a hot spare on the
Ti8scviDiYc,1208799,1211600,flash side i would probably just
Ti8scviDiYc,1211600,1213360,make it raise d2 instead of having a hot
Ti8scviDiYc,1213360,1214240,spare
Ti8scviDiYc,1214240,1216000,only because flash wears differently
Ti8scviDiYc,1216000,1218640,than mechanical hard drives now okay so
Ti8scviDiYc,1218640,1221039,what about a raid z2 and a hot spare oh
Ti8scviDiYc,1221039,1223280,my god jake okay all right let's just go
Ti8scviDiYc,1223280,1225360,raid z2 then with seven drives we need
Ti8scviDiYc,1225360,1226880,to put some footage on this thing nice
Ti8scviDiYc,1226880,1228480,it's going through my workstation so
Ti8scviDiYc,1228480,1230400,it's not going to be that fast wow even
Ti8scviDiYc,1230400,1232240,through your workstation it's doing 400
Ti8scviDiYc,1232240,1234480,plus megabytes a second
Ti8scviDiYc,1234480,1237520,you know what i should go jump onto mine
Ti8scviDiYc,1237520,1239039,and hit it at the same time and see if
Ti8scviDiYc,1239039,1241200,that even goes down i bet it won't
Ti8scviDiYc,1241200,1243120,the bottleneck is going to be your
Ti8scviDiYc,1243120,1246640,your station not this machine okay well
Ti8scviDiYc,1246640,1248320,i'm still copying at
Ti8scviDiYc,1248320,1250720,400 to 450 megabytes a second how about
Ti8scviDiYc,1250720,1253120,you okay you ready for me to press go oh
Ti8scviDiYc,1253120,1254880,you haven't pressed go yet okay i
Ti8scviDiYc,1254880,1258159,already did yeah that's what i figured
Ti8scviDiYc,1259360,1260640,yeah the one thing to consider is
Ti8scviDiYc,1260640,1263280,because we're copying like a folder full
Ti8scviDiYc,1263280,1265440,of a bunch of little files windows will
Ti8scviDiYc,1265440,1267200,never really get there because it's like
Ti8scviDiYc,1267200,1268720,starting stopping starting zapping
Ti8scviDiYc,1268720,1271440,starting stopping but that's still super
Ti8scviDiYc,1271440,1273600,awesome this is really important just
Ti8scviDiYc,1273600,1274840,because we have
Ti8scviDiYc,1274840,1278000,redundancy okay so we have that extra
Ti8scviDiYc,1278000,1280080,couple of drives that can fail
Ti8scviDiYc,1280080,1282960,doesn't mean that we have backup
Ti8scviDiYc,1282960,1284480,so if this is where they're going to
Ti8scviDiYc,1284480,1286640,store their active projects then if
Ti8scviDiYc,1286640,1289120,something were to go wrong let's say
Ti8scviDiYc,1289120,1291440,uh a power supply blue i mean
Ti8scviDiYc,1291440,1293760,theoretically those are
Ti8scviDiYc,1293760,1295919,also redundant so you could just you
Ti8scviDiYc,1295919,1297360,could just yank one in the middle of
Ti8scviDiYc,1297360,1299200,operation but let's say it blew in such
Ti8scviDiYc,1299200,1301520,a catastrophic way that it lit on fire
Ti8scviDiYc,1301520,1303360,okay the server is dead but somehow the
Ti8scviDiYc,1303360,1305360,fire doesn't spread outside the steel
Ti8scviDiYc,1305360,1306799,chassis and light the other server on
Ti8scviDiYc,1306799,1308880,fire we need a backup
Ti8scviDiYc,1308880,1311360,that backup is gonna go automatically
Ti8scviDiYc,1311360,1313679,from this server to this one
Ti8scviDiYc,1313679,1315520,unfortunately eating up some of our
Ti8scviDiYc,1315520,1317600,capacity but not that much it's gonna be
Ti8scviDiYc,1317600,1319919,incremental so but each time it backs up
Ti8scviDiYc,1319919,1321679,it's it's keeping what's already on
Ti8scviDiYc,1321679,1323440,there and just adding the new stuff yes
Ti8scviDiYc,1323440,1325200,and it will cycle automatically so we
Ti8scviDiYc,1325200,1327120,can set it so it keeps like a daily
Ti8scviDiYc,1327120,1329200,backup uh for two weeks and it
Ti8scviDiYc,1329200,1330799,automatically deletes the old ones when
Ti8scviDiYc,1330799,1332559,it makes the new ones and doesn't store
Ti8scviDiYc,1332559,1333919,a bunch on here
Ti8scviDiYc,1333919,1335360,and then as soon as they delete
Ti8scviDiYc,1335360,1337840,something from here that will eventually
Ti8scviDiYc,1337840,1339840,fade out of those daily or weekly
Ti8scviDiYc,1339840,1343200,backups until the only copy that exists
Ti8scviDiYc,1343200,1345440,is the archival copy which
Ti8scviDiYc,1345440,1348240,like us dream has said is not
