h6AkvAj_hao,546447,551467,"MATT: And welcome back.  So last we left off,"
h6AkvAj_hao,551467,557107,our band of heroes had been  pursuing a few variable threads.
h6AkvAj_hao,557107,562967,"You had come to Eshteross with information  about this strange entity, the Nightmare King"
h6AkvAj_hao,562967,568557,"which you had encountered,  who seemed to be responsible for a lot of the chaos  bursting across the city of Jrusar"
h6AkvAj_hao,568557,573787,that you had been either hearing of or present for.  They also mentioned that they were under the employ
h6AkvAj_hao,573787,581717,"of some individual named Armand.  Eshteross says this sounds like Armand Treshi,  a name familiar to you in some of these other investigations"
h6AkvAj_hao,581717,587462,"and it was said that possibly, in the coming event,  a ball of sorts, that is being held in"
h6AkvAj_hao,587463,593454,"under a week here in the city,  may be interest in trying to find out more  about the individuals involved,"
h6AkvAj_hao,593454,598110,"if not other ventures.  You okay, Marisha?  MARISHA: Uh-huh.  MATT: Okay. (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,599813,606252,(squeaking/honking noises)  You also found the individual that
h6AkvAj_hao,606252,613837,"Chetney was looking for, Gurge,  who gave you some information about where to find out  the whereabouts of this"
h6AkvAj_hao,613837,620477,"troop of hemocraft-based warriors that had  essentially found ways to keep their beast at bay,"
h6AkvAj_hao,620477,625927,"may be able to teach you.  Now with this, you're able to also speak,"
h6AkvAj_hao,625927,632677,"at Eshteross' introduction,  to Oshad ""The Anger"" Breshio"
h6AkvAj_hao,632677,640137,and the family of which he was protecting  when two of the family members were killed recently  by a very familiar assassination attempt.
h6AkvAj_hao,640137,647907,"Gathering a bit of information and a direction  into Heartmoor to find more information,  you also finally had a path into the Conservatory"
h6AkvAj_hao,647907,654376,"that you've been waiting for since your arrival in Jrusar.  Late into the evening, you all went up and waited patiently"
h6AkvAj_hao,654377,660807,"as Imogen went through the library to seek  any information that might help unveil answers  about her strange, reoccurring nightmares"
h6AkvAj_hao,660807,667263,"and her odd abilities, and you found some.  Something, at least."
h6AkvAj_hao,667263,673027,Possible rumors and theories  about seemingly historical recurrences
h6AkvAj_hao,673027,679167,"of similar visions and dreams by others.  And a name, a familiar one,"
h6AkvAj_hao,679167,684827,"that of your mother, Liliana Temult,  before the remainder of this one report"
h6AkvAj_hao,684827,691427,"was seen torn and missing.  And that's where we left off.  So Imogen, as you stand there,"
h6AkvAj_hao,691427,696427,poring down upon at least the bulk of this report tome
h6AkvAj_hao,696537,702837,"that you were able to locate, the rest of it missing,  the possible ramifications of this information"
h6AkvAj_hao,702837,710476,washing over you. What do you do?  LAURA: The page or the student that's helping me?
h6AkvAj_hao,710476,714500,"MATT: Mm-hmm, the scribe, yeah.  LAURA: The scribe. Can I ask him:"
h6AkvAj_hao,716157,721895,How could pages be torn out of this?  I thought these books were protected.  MATT: He takes it.
h6AkvAj_hao,723922,728627,"""This is very unusual and a great shame."

h6AkvAj_hao,742227,748217,"""We'll go ahead and look into it immediately.""  LAURA: Do you keep track of who checks out the books?"
h6AkvAj_hao,748217,753716,"MATT: ""We generally have some semblance of information.  ""I can look into it.""  LAURA: Maybe find out who had them last."
h6AkvAj_hao,753716,760797,"MATT: ""That would be the first order of our investigation.""  LAURA: I would very much be interested in knowing that.  MATT: ""That would be official school investigation,"
h6AkvAj_hao,760797,766604,"""and do note,  ""as an individual who also is seeking this information,  ""we'd have to make record that you were the last"

h6AkvAj_hao,780367,786496,"""I'll go look into it.""  LAURA: You were with the people  that would've had the tome?  MATT: ""It would have been myself  ""or one of the other scribes"

h6AkvAj_hao,805506,810789,"late night silence of the library,  the occasional distant echoing cough or sniffle"
h6AkvAj_hao,810789,816397,or a shuffling of the other four individuals  that occupy the library space this late at night.
h6AkvAj_hao,816397,823607,"Otherwise, this open space around you  is almost oppressive.  You can glance up and see the tall, thin glass windows"
h6AkvAj_hao,823607,829147,that look out into the starry sky.  Then you ponder over the immensity
h6AkvAj_hao,829147,835378,of what any of this could mean.  LAURA: Do I know how late it's gotten?
h6AkvAj_hao,838307,844136,"MATT: You would gather, at this point,  it's well past midnight.  It's not super, super early morning,"
h6AkvAj_hao,844137,850017,"but it's now a hour past--  A short time later, the scribe returns,"

h6AkvAj_hao,938597,944667,"LAURA: Oh, before I leave.  Is Professor Kadija Sumal,"

h6AkvAj_hao,994772,1000334,"I need to find out.  But they did a study,  and my mom-- my mother was part of it."

h6AkvAj_hao,1005997,1011960,"I'm so sorry, it's so late, you guys.  It got to the part it was just really getting interesting,  and I have no idea why she was part of it,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1011960,1016518,"and then the pages were ripped out,  and apparently, the pages were ripped out  by the Lumas twins."

h6AkvAj_hao,1046927,1053790,"SAM: Oh, okay.  MARISHA: Hmm. TALIESIN: Huh.  LAURA: The moons giving power."
h6AkvAj_hao,1053790,1059319,"LIAM: That's what you were looking into?  LAURA: Yeah, I wanted to find out why I started getting"
h6AkvAj_hao,1059319,1065210,"the powers that I did,  why they timed up the way they did."
h6AkvAj_hao,1068267,1074990,"ROBBIE: When you say your mother  was a part of the study,  was she a researcher, or an actual person in the study?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1074990,1079955,LAURA: I think she was someone in the study.  I don't know.  ASHLEY: Could you ask her?
h6AkvAj_hao,1081207,1086937,"LAURA: I don't--  She's gone, Fearne."
h6AkvAj_hao,1086937,1092107,"I don't know her.  SAM: Like dead, or--?  LAURA: I don't know her. I don't know."
h6AkvAj_hao,1092107,1097674,MARISHA: Did your-- SAM: Did you ever know her?  MARISHA: Did your father ever
h6AkvAj_hao,1097674,1102360,"talk about this? LAURA: Talk about her?  Never.  Any time I tried to bring her up,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1104367,1107563,it was like he just turned off.
h6AkvAj_hao,1109977,1115707,"Part of me thinks that's one of the reasons  he stopped coming around me.  Once everything started changing,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1115707,1121065,it's almost like he knew  that he'd give something away.
h6AkvAj_hao,1123169,1127983,I just thought he was uncomfortable.  I didn't know--  I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,1129147,1134877,"SAM: But he was keeping her a secret or something?  LAURA: I mean, I know she existed."
h6AkvAj_hao,1134877,1141707,I know who she was.  I don't know anything about her.  TRAVIS: Did your dad ever say anything about your mom
h6AkvAj_hao,1141707,1145317,having the same sort of gifts? Nothing like that?
h6AkvAj_hao,1147137,1153077,"ASHLEY: Do you happen to know if she's still alive,  or you don't know?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1153077,1154077,LAURA: I thought she was--
h6AkvAj_hao,1158887,1165697,I hear her in my dreams.  I think it's her.  LIAM: Do you think that she was here?
h6AkvAj_hao,1165697,1172095,Or that the book just made its way here?  LAURA: I think the book made its way here.
h6AkvAj_hao,1174728,1181524,"This professor, this person that wrote the book,  they're not here, so."
h6AkvAj_hao,1181524,1189527,"MARISHA: I wonder if we can track them down.  Do you happen to know how long ago this book was made?  I mean, if it was revolving around your mother."
h6AkvAj_hao,1189527,1197377,"LAURA: That's true.  It could've been years before I was ever.  I didn't ask.  I'm an idiot, I didn't ask.  SAM: The book was studying your mother as a subject,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1197377,1204327,"or she was one of the--  LAURA: She was one of many subjects.  SAM: Oh, okay.  ROBBIE: Most universities, books that are written,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1204327,1210877,"research papers, they're part of a study,  they communicate.  If you're allowed in the library,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1210877,1216620,are you allowed in the rest of the university?  LAURA: I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,1217837,1224902,"MATT: The paperwork that you were given offers you access  to the-- LAURA: The library.  MATT: The premises, to the level that a student would."
h6AkvAj_hao,1224902,1233437,LAURA: Oh!  TRAVIS: Oh shit.  MARISHA: Maybe the university knows where this professor is.
h6AkvAj_hao,1233577,1239717,"TALIESIN: You said the book was damaged, though.  Or no, the Lumas twins--  LAURA: Potentially had ripped the pages out."
h6AkvAj_hao,1239717,1245357,"So maybe the pages are at their house, or--?  TALIESIN: Well, I mean, that's a lead, in my opinion."
h6AkvAj_hao,1245357,1251577,"TRAVIS: Yeah, refresh my memory.  The Lumas twins, Bell and Jar, they were killed?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1252129,1258807,MARISHA: Yes. TRAVIS: The Hunger--  The Anger was--  MARISHA: By a similar attack from--  TRAVIS: Right. MARISHA: -- Orym experienced.
h6AkvAj_hao,1258807,1265450,"TRAVIS: They were in their 20s, right?  LAURA: Yeah, 22, I think.  MATT: Imogen, you do recall that in the paper,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1266977,1272567,"it did note that Professor Kadija Sumal,  was based out of the Aydinlan Seminary"
h6AkvAj_hao,1272567,1277695,"in the city of Yios.  LAURA: Oh, right.  MATT: The capital of Aeshanadoor."
h6AkvAj_hao,1277695,1281740,"It's far to the southeast of here.  LAURA: Oh, okay.  MARISHA: Wait."
h6AkvAj_hao,1283287,1291055,"One more time for the people who didn't get that.  Not me, though.  MATT: Aydinlan, A-Y-D-I-N-L-A-N Seminary."
h6AkvAj_hao,1294684,1301617,"MATT: In the city of Yios, which is Y-I-O-S.  MARISHA: Y-S. Y.  ROBBIE: Would we-- Just knowing that name,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1301617,1307357,"would you know what type of religion  was being studied there,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1307357,1313211,"or is that sort of a question mark?  MATT: Make a history or religion check, your choice."
h6AkvAj_hao,1315977,1321737,"ROBBIE: Oop.  Seven. MATT: Seven?  I mean, the best that you can recall in your travels,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1321737,1326030,"and knowing Marquet decently, the city of Yios is,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1328727,1334867,"it combats with Ank'Harel as the center of  academic study,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1334868,1339859,and is often touted as  the pinnacle of academia in Marquet.
h6AkvAj_hao,1342347,1349362,It tends to be more aloof  against the rest of the political...
h6AkvAj_hao,1349363,1354492,"interactions across the continent and beyond,  and if you aren't taking"
h6AkvAj_hao,1357000,1361142,"a direct route in with an escort,  the path to get there is challenging."
h6AkvAj_hao,1364347,1370927,TRAVIS: You really shouldn't sleep on that student access.  You could wander into a lab.  I hear they experiment with all sorts of
h6AkvAj_hao,1370927,1374500,mind-altering shit.  Get a free ride.
h6AkvAj_hao,1377187,1383991,SAM: And Frisbee golf. TALIESIN: Huh.  LAURA: That's true.  SAM: On the quad.  LIAM: And-- TRAVIS: Open your horizons.
h6AkvAj_hao,1383991,1389715,"LAURA: You know, I think I'm going to hold off on that,  just because, you know,  if I get kicked out before I get a chance"
h6AkvAj_hao,1389715,1394715,"to do any more research, I'll be kind of bummed."
h6AkvAj_hao,1394797,1402927,TRAVIS: Suit yourself.  TALIESIN: Is this free ride  theoretical or from experience?  I just want to know.  TRAVIS: I've experimented with quite a few things in my day.
h6AkvAj_hao,1402927,1408669,"Sometimes, it's a free ride.  Sometimes, you pay.  LIAM: Who's got the map?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1409857,1415677,SAM: It's behind you.  LIAM: Is it? LAURA: You've got the map.  LIAM: I don't think I do.  You guys would see it poking two feet
h6AkvAj_hao,1415677,1421492,"above my head, if I had the map.  (laughter)  TALIESIN: I just assumed you were a save point."
h6AkvAj_hao,1422594,1428140,LAURA: Is it on the map?  LIAM: I don't know.  ASHLEY: I have something written down.  I don't know if this is important.
h6AkvAj_hao,1429626,1435053,"ROBBIE: It's a good start.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, a good start.  LAURA: The city of Yios is down below the map."
h6AkvAj_hao,1435053,1440764,"LIAM: Off the map? MATT: Yeah.  It's off the map, way in a southeast direction.  LAURA: It's far away.  MATT: There is the Hellcatch Valley"
h6AkvAj_hao,1440764,1446997,"between that region and where you are now.  The Hellcatch Valley sits central to Marquet,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1446997,1451890,and is the lawless waypoint  between the other major regions.
h6AkvAj_hao,1453707,1457360,"Now there used to be more skyports, but the--"
h6AkvAj_hao,1460179,1466227,"How is it called? The Apex War,  roughly two decades before that  happened between Aeshanadoor and the Stratos Throne,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1466227,1472454,"both locations destroyed their skyports,  and haven't put them up since."
h6AkvAj_hao,1472454,1477657,"So right now, the only skyports that exist officially  in Marquet are Ank'Harel and Jrusar."
h6AkvAj_hao,1477657,1484617,"LAURA: Oh wow. MATT: Which has brought  a lot more trade and a lot more business  into Jrusar ever since, but it also means  those two other major players in the politics of Marquet"
h6AkvAj_hao,1484617,1490708,"have been a little more isolated and slowly rebuilding  their political outreach.  TALIESIN: I appreciate the ""officially"""
h6AkvAj_hao,1490708,1495900,"that was snuck in there, by the way.  That's exciting.  (laughter)  SAM: Fearne, you had something"
h6AkvAj_hao,1495900,1502147,"very important to say.  ASHLEY: Oh, yes, well, it looks like I wrote,  this is probably, means nothing,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1502147,1508729,"but a friend of Brushad's, Estani?  LIAM: Yeah? ASHLEY: Was also from Yios,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1508729,1516077,"and it said we could talk to them about the attack.  I can't read what the rest of what I wrote,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1516077,1523106,"because it's  squiggles.  LIAM: Well, I was going to ask you, Imogen,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1523107,1530567,"first, are you going to spend any more hours or days  searching here, or--?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1530567,1538452,"LAURA: I mean, I was there for quite a while, wasn't I?  SAM: I mean, yeah, but  if you didn't find what you were looking for,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1538452,1543915,we should keep looking.  LAURA: I feel like that's what I was looking for.
h6AkvAj_hao,1546687,1550029,"SAM: But I mean, you didn't learn  about your condition or anything."
h6AkvAj_hao,1552227,1557497,"LAURA: I wonder if I could check that--  No, I can't check the book out,  because I turned it in because it had ripped out pages,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1557497,1565239,"because I'm really smart.  MATT: As is the nature with most students,  the official tomes cannot be removed from the library."
h6AkvAj_hao,1565239,1570907,"You are welcome to spend time copying them,  which is what some students do.  If not taking notes from them, there are people"
h6AkvAj_hao,1570907,1578137,whose jobs are to scribe one to one those tomes  if they are to be included to other libraries.  It's a bit time-intensive.
h6AkvAj_hao,1578137,1583787,LAURA: Yeah. MATT: But it's doable.  LAURA: Did I take notes on the other people's names
h6AkvAj_hao,1583787,1589710,"that I saw in there?  MATT: Well, there were probably like  three dozen names of people that,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1589710,1595167,"in some way, shape or form,  were contacted as a part of it,  and then there were a number of other names  that were mentioned through history,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1595167,1599560,of people that were historically written  to have spoken about having similar visions.
h6AkvAj_hao,1601247,1607207,"So yeah, we'll say you noted a number of names  as you went through.  LAURA: Okay. Did it say in the book when it was written?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1608711,1615431,"MATT: You didn't get there because it was torn out.  LAURA: Okay.  LIAM: Like Ash said,"
h6AkvAj_hao,1615431,1620431,we could maybe double back to the Lumas house
h6AkvAj_hao,1620701,1625791,"and if that doesn't turn anything up,  there is the Heartmoor Hamlet."
h6AkvAj_hao,1625791,1632924,"LAURA: I mean, we need to go there anyway.  LIAM: I do. LAURA: It's certainly a good lead.  MARISHA: And that was where the Lumas twins were studying."
h6AkvAj_hao,1632925,1639388,"LAURA: That's where his patron was sending us too, so.  It all lines up.  LIAM: That's wild. TALIESIN: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,1640728,1646359,"SAM: Oderan Wild. (laughter)  SAM: But that's far journey, right, and we have--"
h6AkvAj_hao,1646359,1653081,LAURA: It's a few days. SAM: We have a ball to attend.  LAURA: Yeah.  We can go after the ball.
h6AkvAj_hao,1653081,1659106,"TALIESIN: Party, then work, I think is the way to go.  SAM: That is always your philosophy.  TALIESIN: Well, it's party then party"
h6AkvAj_hao,1659106,1664425,"until you have to work,  but yes, yes, you're technically correct."
h6AkvAj_hao,1665311,1670951,"That's-- (sighs)  MARISHA: All right, well, what are some loose ends  we need to do in town?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1670951,1676211,Do we still need to sign this contract with Eshteross?  TALIESIN: We also need to figure out--
h6AkvAj_hao,1676211,1682440,"I assume we have to wear things  if we're going to go to this thing.  MARISHA: Oh, right. LAURA: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,1682441,1689272,"MARISHA: Got to get a tux for Pâté.  TALIESIN: That, I approve of. (chuckling)"
h6AkvAj_hao,1689272,1696862,"LAURA: I wonder if a few days is enough time  to get that custom made.  MARISHA: If not, maybe--  Chetney, do you know how to sew?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1696863,1702341,"TRAVIS: Basically, just to repair my own stuff,  I can't make fancy shit.  TALIESIN: You should definitely repair your own stuff."
h6AkvAj_hao,1702341,1707634,"TRAVIS: What're you talking about?  TALIESIN: Nothing.  TRAVIS: This is all character, baby.  TALIESIN: Yeah.  Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,1708761,1713771,"Very.  I can sew, but it looks like this."
h6AkvAj_hao,1714711,1722093,"MARISHA: It's pretty gorgeous.  TALIESIN: Thank you, I don't think it's going to get us  in the door, though.  MARISHA: Even if I could find him  a tiny bow tie, that might suffice."
h6AkvAj_hao,1722093,1727421,"LAURA: (laughs)  SAM: If we're sticking around, then,  that means that Imogen can keep going to the library"
h6AkvAj_hao,1728321,1734701,"over and over and see if--  LAURA: Every night. SAM: Yeah, and see if she can  figure out what's going on in your noggin."
h6AkvAj_hao,1734701,1740121,"TRAVIS: Yeah, is there any reason  to look up the other books  that the Lumas twins might've checked out?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1740121,1746721,"LAURA: That's a great idea. TALIESIN: Holy shit.  ASHLEY: That is a very good idea. TRAVIS: What?  LAURA: Oh my gosh. TALIESIN: Just a really good idea.  LAURA: Chetney, that's really smart."
h6AkvAj_hao,1746721,1753132,"TRAVIS: Yeah. My favorite movie's ""Seven,"" so.  LIAM: Favorite what?  TRAVIS: What? LAURA: Huh?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1753132,1758431,MARISHA: That would be his favorite movie.  (laughter)  TALIESIN: Makes so sad.
h6AkvAj_hao,1758431,1764747,LIAM: What's in the book? (laughter)  TALIESIN: What's in the box? No.  LAURA: I can come back tomorrow night.
h6AkvAj_hao,1764747,1769151,"MARISHA: All right. LAURA: Yeah.  MARISHA: Yes, maybe we can also find out more about--"
h6AkvAj_hao,1771022,1778631,"Other things.  Other things. LAURA: Yes.  A lot of other things.  SAM: Are you being vague on purpose, or--?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1778631,1782927,"MARISHA: No, I just couldn't think of any at the moment.  SAM: Oh, cool, cool. (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,1785001,1790171,"SAM: It's late now, isn't it? LAURA: Yeah, we should go to sleep.  MATT: It's probably somewhere close to one in the morning.  LIAM: Jeez. TRAVIS: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,1790171,1797611,"TALIESIN: Sleep. LIAM: That was a lot of books.  TRAVIS: Get turned up.  TALIESIN: Some reading, some potions.  Get ready to party, to leave town."
h6AkvAj_hao,1797611,1800999,This is all exciting. LAURA: Yeah.  TALIESIN: Sleep.
h6AkvAj_hao,1802803,1808440,"LAURA: Go back to our--  LIAM: Sleeping Spire. LAURA: Our tavern.  MATT: Okay, so you're heading back to the Spire by Fire?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1808440,1814851,Okay.  LAURA: We have not checked in  with Zhudanna in quite a few days.
h6AkvAj_hao,1814851,1820151,"MARISHA: Oh goodness.  LAURA: Maybe we should sleep there tonight  just to make sure she's okay.  MARISHA: All right, let's try not to wake her, though."
h6AkvAj_hao,1820151,1822314,It's so late. LAURA: Yeah.
h6AkvAj_hao,1825541,1833061,"MATT: All right.  So the rest of you go and take a room out,  or rooms out at the Spire by Fire."
h6AkvAj_hao,1833061,1839071,So you could easily  uncomfortably fit all of you in one room  or comfortably fit you within two or three.
h6AkvAj_hao,1840821,1847343,"That'll run, let's say about a gold for the two rooms  for the night.  TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it. TALIESIN: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,1847343,1853711,MARISHA: We're sleeping at Zhudanna's. MATT: They're modest sized.  As you both make your way to the Windowed Wall
h6AkvAj_hao,1853711,1859684,and approach the exterior of Zhudanna's homestead.  The door is closed.
h6AkvAj_hao,1861221,1866445,LAURA: Okay. MARISHA: (laughs)  LAURA: We go and unlock it and go in. Can we go in?
h6AkvAj_hao,1866445,1873246,TRAVIS: Check for traps!  MATT: Okay. MARISHA: What's wrong?  Does it look fine? What-- LAURA: Is it okay?  Does it look weird?
h6AkvAj_hao,1873246,1879832,MARISHA: Has she watered her flowers?  MATT: Make a perception check.  (clamoring)  TALIESIN: He's fucking with you.  LAURA: Oh no!
h6AkvAj_hao,1879833,1885761,TRAVIS: How could you be so careless?  MARISHA: Oh! LAURA: 12.
h6AkvAj_hao,1885761,1892042,"MARISHA: 22. TALIESIN: Ey!  MARISHA: Wait, wait. Nope.  Nope, that's a 13, not an 18."
h6AkvAj_hao,1892042,1897624,16. MATT: 16. Still pretty decent.  MARISHA: 17. (laughter)  MATT: You realize that the door--
h6AkvAj_hao,1898541,1904881,TRAVIS: Will you take 18? ROBBIE: So many numbers!  TRAVIS: Maybe 15? (laughter)  MATT: (stuttering sounds) - teen?
h6AkvAj_hao,1904881,1909596,"LIAM: Will you take 15 and a half?  MATT: One dollar. TRAVIS: (auctioneer patter) 45, 50."
h6AkvAj_hao,1912364,1918953,"MATT: You find that the door isn't locked,  it is slightly jammed and it's been this way before.  It's the way that Zhudanna could just"
h6AkvAj_hao,1918953,1925219,lift and push it open. LAURA: Yeah.  MARISHA: We've got to fix that for her.  MATT: The smell of a recently-fizzled oil lantern
h6AkvAj_hao,1925219,1931171,fills the air.  It is lightless in the interior.  You glance inward and you can see
h6AkvAj_hao,1931171,1938332,"those Dancing Lights emerge as well  sitting in the far recliner, Zhudanna.  MARISHA: She awake or asleep?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1938332,1944351,MATT: She appears to be unconscious.  LAURA: Why is he making it sound like  she's dead? MARISHA: I know!  SAM: Can't tell if she's awake
h6AkvAj_hao,1944351,1950721,because she doesn't have a head.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,1950722,1956341,"LAURA: Oh no, what if she's like--  What if she just--  Does it smell funny? Does it smell funny?"
h6AkvAj_hao,1956341,1962031,"MATT: No. MARISHA: She's breathing, right?  Is she breathing?  MATT: You rolled high on that perception check.  Yeah, she's breathing. She's asleep in her chair."
h6AkvAj_hao,1962031,1967649,"LAURA: Jeez louise, Matt!  TRAVIS: You got some mileage out of that one, man."
h6AkvAj_hao,1967649,1973218,"""You smell a metal smell."" MATT: She's just asleep.  SAM: You can't tell how regularly she's breathing."
h6AkvAj_hao,1974881,1981205,"Could be shallow breaths.  MARISHA: All right, well, put her to bed.  LAURA: Lead her to bed. MARISHA: Yes, we lead her to bed."
h6AkvAj_hao,1981206,1986855,"MATT: She half wakes up.  ""Oh, I was wondering where you were."""
h6AkvAj_hao,1986855,1992511,"Lead her back to bed.  ""Are you hungry?""  LAURA: Oh, go to bed.  MATT: ""Okay."" MARISHA: We'll chat in the morning."
h6AkvAj_hao,1992511,1998969,MATT: She goes right to bed and transitions  immediately back into whatever dream had held her.
h6AkvAj_hao,2000152,2006981,LAURA: I thought she was dead.  MARISHA: Maybe it's just because I've got death on the brain.  I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,2006981,2012971,"LAURA: Like, what if something we did led someone here  and then-- (sighs)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2012971,2018281,"We got to check on her more often.  MARISHA: Yeah, we should. LAURA: She is old.  MARISHA: She could die at any moment."
h6AkvAj_hao,2018281,2026234,"She's just so frail.  SAM: ""I can hear you.""  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2027547,2033167,"SAM: ""I'm still in the room.""  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2035461,2040121,"MATT: So you all get your long rest for the night,  preparing for the following morning."
h6AkvAj_hao,2041591,2047139,"Now, counting from where Eshteross had told you,  you're about four days from the ball.  MARISHA: Okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,2048945,2056001,"MATT: But-- LAURA: Sorry.  Were the dreams any different  having read the information I did,  or was it the same as it always is?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2056001,2061392,"MATT: Well, you don't have this dream every night.  It's not a particularly intense nightmare"
h6AkvAj_hao,2061392,2068311,every single time.  It's just a recurring one. LAURA: Okay.  MATT: This was a restful night's sleep comparatively.
h6AkvAj_hao,2068311,2076360,"Still, your brain processing memories  Still, your brain processing memories"
h6AkvAj_hao,2076361,2083091,"and pieces of other dreams,  and when you come back to consciousness,  unable to really recall what it was"
h6AkvAj_hao,2083091,2091539,"that you were experiencing,  but nothing as visceral and as intense  as the often-recurring red storm."
h6AkvAj_hao,2095241,2102731,"SAM: We're all together again, or--?  MATT: Yes, you all managed to meet up once again.  Breakfast is had. The day is yours."
h6AkvAj_hao,2102731,2109661,"What would you like to do?  TRAVIS: Do we need a long rest?  We didn't do anything, right?  LAURA: I don't think so. TALIESIN: Sleep is good."
h6AkvAj_hao,2109661,2116963,"Without it, you feel shitty, so.  I feel like that's an accomplishment by itself."
h6AkvAj_hao,2118141,2123417,LIAM: Does anyone have anything to do  besides kill time before this 'do?
h6AkvAj_hao,2124561,2132166,"SAM: There's some items that I could use,  or some upgrades that I could use  to perform different, newer tasks."
h6AkvAj_hao,2132166,2138442,"LAURA: Oh! MARISHA: I'd like to go  shopping as well.  TALIESIN: I would not say no.  We need potions, we need some shit."
h6AkvAj_hao,2138443,2142966,"ASHLEY: Oh, are we going to go shopping?  MARISHA and LAURA: ♪ Shopping ♪"
h6AkvAj_hao,2143831,2150243,"TRAVIS: If we go shopping,  don't go to the Prison Emporium.  SAM: The Prison Emporium?  TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever that place is called."
h6AkvAj_hao,2150243,2156291,It's a fuckin' rip off.  I got business there later.  ASHLEY and SAM: Oh!
h6AkvAj_hao,2156291,2162931,SAM: The Prism Emporium?  TRAVIS: That sounds probably more likely.  LIAM: That sounded really loaded.
h6AkvAj_hao,2162931,2166550,"TALIESIN: Do we want the expensive places,  or do we want the cheap places?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2168991,2176471,"MARISHA: Always cheap, but also with magic?  TALIESIN: Would Emenar's have magic shit or no?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2179271,2186380,"I don't think we've been to Emenar's yet.  MATT: You have not been to Emenar's yet.  Emenar's may occasionally rarely have something,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2186381,2192013,"but it-- TALIESIN: It's not the vibe.  MATT: It's not the vibe.  Those are rare, scavenged elements when they do show up."
h6AkvAj_hao,2192013,2199241,"TALIESIN: It's not the Take-it-or-Leave-it.  Man, thinking."
h6AkvAj_hao,2199241,2204498,"MATT: Places that you could think of, there's the--  TALIESIN: Prism Emporium, I guess."
h6AkvAj_hao,2204499,2210903,MATT: The Prism Emporium.  There's the Trove of Marwa.  There is...
h6AkvAj_hao,2210903,2216404,TRAVIS: Trove of Marwa.  ASHLEY: Advik's Wandering Curiosities and Collections?
h6AkvAj_hao,2216404,2222991,"TRAVIS: ""Marwa Endalia.""  I don't know what that means.  TALIESIN: That sounds fun."
h6AkvAj_hao,2222991,2229471,"Trove sounds fun.  MATT: Your call. LIAM: Also--  Oh, go ahead. MATT: Your call."
h6AkvAj_hao,2229471,2235640,"LIAM: There's a dress code, too.  I don't-- How do we--  Maybe you know."
h6AkvAj_hao,2235641,2242841,"ROBBIE: Oh, dress code,  not so much you have to dress a certain way,  but you want to present a certain air."
h6AkvAj_hao,2242841,2248581,"Upscale, I would say, for certain,  probably not cheap.  Everyone looks nice, I think you all look nice."
h6AkvAj_hao,2248581,2255621,"You look very nice!  LAURA: If we're going to a ball, we need nice clothes.  ROBBIE: Correct. That is correct, yes.  TRAVIS: What happens if you don't wear nice clothes?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2255621,2260881,"ROBBIE: If you don't?  TRAVIS: Yeah, do they not let you in?  ROBBIE: Less so."
h6AkvAj_hao,2260881,2266891,"More so, you wouldn't be able to utilize  the social experience of a ball."
h6AkvAj_hao,2266891,2272465,"People wouldn't want to talk to you,  you'd be off in the corner by yourself, and--  No, no, no, no, no. None of that.  Not in a good way. TRAVIS: You're selling this"
h6AkvAj_hao,2272465,2280711,"real hard. (laughter)  TRAVIS: I'm digging it.  ROBBIE: I think if you trust us,  we can make you up and you could feel just at home."
h6AkvAj_hao,2280711,2285552,"TRAVIS: Trust.  ROBBIE: All right.  Yeah, that's my opinion."
h6AkvAj_hao,2286451,2292361,"LIAM: I mean, I feel like you have the most experience  with a performance, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2292361,2299521,"And that's what this is.  We want to fit in, it's a performance.  Do you want to style us? TALIESIN: Do you want to dress us?  LAURA: Oh my gosh. MARISHA: Please dress us."
h6AkvAj_hao,2299521,2305571,"ROBBIE: I would absolutely love to, yes!  (cheering)  ROBBIE: Absolutely."
h6AkvAj_hao,2305571,2313441,"TALIESIN: The less I have to think about this, the better.  I'm very excited.  MATT: In your times that you spent,  though not detailed elements,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2313441,2321971,"one thing you did clock  as you were traversing through the Lucent Spire,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2321971,2328811,"in that brief, brief spin that you guys were doing recently,  you recall a location referred to as The Golden Veil."
h6AkvAj_hao,2328811,2333705,It looked like a high-end clothing and attire boutique.  TRAVIS: Goddamn it.
h6AkvAj_hao,2335761,2340134,"LAURA: It's probably too late to get something custom made.  TRAVIS: Probably too late, yep."
h6AkvAj_hao,2341081,2348593,"ROBBIE: Actually, most sort of nicer places  do have a in-house alterations person."
h6AkvAj_hao,2348593,2354751,"It shouldn't take more than a day or two per person.  For someone with your size and stature,  not quite a bit of material to work with,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2354751,2360456,so it should be pretty quick.  LIAM: So better to get that order in today  because they might need time to get stuff ready for us.
h6AkvAj_hao,2360456,2363880,"LAURA: Yeah. ROBBIE: Yeah!  LAURA: Then even if we don't get invited  to the ball, then--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2365720,2370791,"What?  LIAM: I don't know, your husband is just funny.  MARISHA: He just hates it so much."
h6AkvAj_hao,2372230,2375483,TRAVIS: Taliesin shot me in the heart.  Too good.
h6AkvAj_hao,2378304,2384041,"ROBBIE: I may not know the fashions  of the area or the times,  but I can make sure we all look nice."
h6AkvAj_hao,2384041,2390571,"It's the best I can do, even with Chetney.  LAURA: Chetney, I'm sure, will look fabulous  and I can see him in a nice, little tux."
h6AkvAj_hao,2390571,2397431,"TRAVIS: Yeah, you'll be jealous night of.  I'll be taking numbers.  MARISHA: You should get tails, big, long tails."
h6AkvAj_hao,2397431,2402780,"LAURA: That would be just lovely.  TRAVIS: I can just slit  my cloak down the middle and be set.  ROBBIE: Three-quarter rule, longer torso."
h6AkvAj_hao,2402781,2408351,"Never mind. We'll talk, we'll talk about it.  We'll pass the place-- What was it called?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2408351,2415429,"The Gold-- MATT: The Golden Veil.  ROBBIE: The Golden Veil.  The Golden Veil, does anyone remember seeing that?  LAURA: Yes. I saw it as well, back there."
h6AkvAj_hao,2415429,2420781,We could go back.  ROBBIE: It's worth a pop-in. LAURA: Sure!  ROBBIE: Let's go.  SAM: Mr. Pock O'Pea?
h6AkvAj_hao,2420781,2427141,"TRAVIS: Yes?  SAM: Just in preparation for this ball,  I don't want to stick out or anything."
h6AkvAj_hao,2427141,2432833,"So I was thinking, you know,  I briefly spent time as a turtle"
h6AkvAj_hao,2432833,2441551,"and it was interesting, because I was breathing,  which was new.  TALIESIN: I was going to ask. SAM: It felt really cool."
h6AkvAj_hao,2441551,2447840,But also it felt weird because I had feet  and it was really interesting
h6AkvAj_hao,2447841,2454411,"to sort of propel myself around that way.  I was wondering, maybe, I don't know how,  I don't want to stick out,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2454411,2462906,"so I was thinking if we were to get some garments,  maybe I could get pants.  Could you make wooden feet for me?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2462906,2469471,"They could sort of go on the bottom of the pants,  so it looks like I have legs? ASHLEY: Just hang out  on either side of your wheel?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2469471,2476431,"SAM: Yeah, yeah, there'll be a wheel in the middle  and then two legs on the side.  They wouldn't notice the wheel if they saw some--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2476431,2482691,"TRAVIS: This sparks brilliance.  TALIESIN: If you put a little spike on either side,  then they would--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2482691,2488542,TRAVIS: I can make this happen.  MARISHA: Can you make them look like they're walking?  LIAM: The walking duck toy.
h6AkvAj_hao,2488542,2495279,ASHLEY: What about your face?  TALIESIN: What about it? SAM: Wow.  ASHLEY: I mean that--
h6AkvAj_hao,2495279,2501146,SAM: Insight check.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,2501146,2508071,MATT: Oh my goodness.  ASHLEY: Are you trying to not look like what you are?
h6AkvAj_hao,2508071,2513820,"SAM: Well, I just don't want to make  the event uncomfortable for all of you,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2513820,2519251,"so if you think that I should--  LAURA: You would never make any of us uncomfortable!  SAM: Well, no, I don't want to attract too much attention."
h6AkvAj_hao,2519251,2524274,"Also, aren't we supposed to be there to be  gathering information surreptitiously?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2524274,2529421,"ASHLEY: We need to get you some feet.  TALIESIN: You're fascinating and interesting.  There's nothing that-- If anything,  you are a positive. MARISHA: I think we should"
h6AkvAj_hao,2529421,2534620,"move forward with the feet idea,  just because I want to see that,  but not because--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2534621,2541130,You're perfect just the way you are.  TALIESIN: Do it for you.  SAM: You all accept me. I get it.
h6AkvAj_hao,2541131,2547011,"TALIESIN: Don't do it for us, do it for you.  SAM: Okay. ROBBIE: We're all  going to draw attention regardless.  TRAVIS: Yeah, and I mean, worst comes to worst,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2547011,2553453,"Imogen's got student access now.  We could find the cadaver department  and borrow a face for a night, it'd be no big deal."
h6AkvAj_hao,2553453,2558781,LAURA: Oh. MARISHA: Ooh!  SAM: Could you rig something up  like that with your tools?
h6AkvAj_hao,2558781,2565031,"TRAVIS: I mean, yeah, I'd just get some simple stitching!  Give you a smile.  SAM: Your what? What'd you say?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2565031,2570084,TALIESIN: That idea happened fast.  You've done that before.  TRAVIS: No. LIAM: I don't know if  you could--
h6AkvAj_hao,2571013,2577029,You might need to stick it on with pitch or something.  LAURA: Yeah.  ROBBIE: Let's look at outfits and then we'll talk.
h6AkvAj_hao,2577029,2580744,(laughter)  LAURA: That's fucked up.
h6AkvAj_hao,2582324,2588601,MATT: I hate this. LAURA: I hate it.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,2588602,2593693,TRAVIS: I'll make you look younger!  (ripping)  (laughter)  SAM: I'm here to party!
h6AkvAj_hao,2594693,2601237,MATT: The Jrusar Chainsaw Massacre over here.  Jesus.  LIAM: Smiley day!
h6AkvAj_hao,2601238,2607494,"(laughter)  ROBBIE: Oh man.  SAM: Well, we'll work on the feet  and figure out the face later, I guess."
h6AkvAj_hao,2607494,2613711,TRAVIS: Okay. I start feverishly working  on a new piece of wood.  MATT: I have this image of Fresh Cut Grass
h6AkvAj_hao,2613711,2619141,"with his buzzsaw in a field  with the leather mask on going, ""Ah!""  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2619141,2625095,"TALIESIN: I put googly eyes under mine,  so you get a little bit of that rock, too.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2625095,2630024,"LIAM: Touched the wrong cursed item.  MATT: This is the heroic troop.  TRAVIS: Come on, Michael Bay, make that movie."
h6AkvAj_hao,2632231,2637674,"MATT: All right, so.  You're first heading towards The Golden Veil,  is that what you're doing?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2637674,2644191,"ROBBIE: Or the morgue? What's it going to be?  TALIESIN: Veil, then some magic shit.  LAURA: Golden Veil. ROBBIE: Golden Veil."
h6AkvAj_hao,2644191,2650651,"MATT: Okay, I take it that you are utilizing your  neutral skin cloaks that were gifted by Eshteross"
h6AkvAj_hao,2650651,2658011,as you traverse the city shortly after being present  at some sort of a large arcane explosion
h6AkvAj_hao,2658011,2663531,"at an important locale.  LAURA: Yeah, you know, a change of clothes  is probably wise anyway.  MARISHA: That's a good idea, yes."
h6AkvAj_hao,2663531,2668741,"TALIESIN: What's that? Anyway.  MATT: Okay.  MARISHA: A good idea, or a change of clothes?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2668741,2675711,"TALIESIN: Kind of both, to be honest.  MATT: Well, everyone go ahead and mark two silver  off your character for the travel from last night"
h6AkvAj_hao,2675711,2681578,"from the conservatory-- MARISHA: I got you this time,  Letters.  MATT: And heading to Lucent Spire.  TRAVIS: Are there gondolas and stuff?  Yes. TRAVIS: Okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,2681578,2688944,"LIAM: That's all right, Chetney's got me.  TRAVIS: I do! Four silver!  I work furiously both rides, shavings everywhere."
h6AkvAj_hao,2690721,2696461,"MATT: You got it.  Okay. TRAVIS: Four silver, fuck.  MATT: Heading back into the Lucent Spire,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2696461,2701531,"returning to these beautiful, immaculately kept streets  and small pathways,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2701531,2707870,the estates and gardens that surround you.  It reminds you once again of the variation in class
h6AkvAj_hao,2707871,2713341,stepping into this space  of which much more gold seems to flow  through the neighborhood.
h6AkvAj_hao,2713341,2720341,"But not long afterward, do you see the locale  that is The Golden Veil:"
h6AkvAj_hao,2720341,2728032,"a beautiful, two-story boutique  that seems to hold an intricate architectural design"
h6AkvAj_hao,2728181,2734801,where you can see trim placed along the window sills.  It seems to evoke like the building itself
h6AkvAj_hao,2734801,2741491,"is an outfit. If you were to try and dress a structure,  this is a very well-dressed structure."
h6AkvAj_hao,2741491,2746781,"Even within 20 feet of it,  there is a perfumed smell that seems to waft  through the front doors."
h6AkvAj_hao,2746781,2750324,It's not overpowering.  TRAVIS: It's Abercrombie. (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,2752329,2757349,"TRAVIS: It burns! LAURA: Oh god, it's burning!  MATT: There you go.  TRAVIS: Try some Woods."
h6AkvAj_hao,2758731,2764581,"MATT: Upon entering, the scents mingle a bit  with nice, herbal scents,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2764581,2769661,and it seems to be in a slight cycle  so that no smell seems to dig itself too heavily
h6AkvAj_hao,2769661,2777871,"and consistently into your mind or sinuses.  But within, you can see all manner of dress forms,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2778641,2785131,holding all beautiful designs of fantastic silk dresses  and wraps and scarves.
h6AkvAj_hao,2785131,2791831,You can see there's a whole section for hats.  There are a number of dressing rooms in the back  and at least a half dozen individuals rush around
h6AkvAj_hao,2791831,2800461,in the process of gathering materials.  You hear the sound of  these mechanical machines that are currently stitching
h6AkvAj_hao,2800461,2807401,through the layered material and fine trim into an outfit  as you see an impatient noblewoman standing there
h6AkvAj_hao,2807401,2812276,watching and giving notes aggressively  from over a divider.
h6AkvAj_hao,2813601,2818601,"Near the front, there's an empty--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2820801,2825934,My brain completely shat the bed on that right there.  (laughter)  TALIESIN: There's a void.
h6AkvAj_hao,2825934,2830971,"MATT: There's a, yep, that happens on occasion.  Yay. LAURA: Still loading."
h6AkvAj_hao,2830971,2835814,"MATT: Still loading, yep.  Must gather your party before adventuring forth.  LIAM: Loading in. MATT: Yep."
h6AkvAj_hao,2837721,2844851,"You see all manner of cabinetry and a countertop,  but there is no immediate sign of help at the ready."
h6AkvAj_hao,2844851,2851301,"As you glance around for a second,  you smell, first, some sort of heavy burning tobacco smell."
h6AkvAj_hao,2851301,2858183,"Like a thick, tarry tobacco.  A voice from behind goes,  ""I'm sorry, can I help all of you?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,2859221,2866753,"You glance and you can see  a small gnomish woman  with a grand smile across her face,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2866753,2872841,wrinkles that crack at the corner of the eyes.  But you can see immaculately done eye makeup
h6AkvAj_hao,2872841,2879161,with a gold filigree curl  at the end of each eye.
h6AkvAj_hao,2879161,2884999,"The hair is done up in almost victory rolls, in a way.  And this--"
h6AkvAj_hao,2884999,2891031,I can only describe it as a power suit-type  arrangement that sits on her.
h6AkvAj_hao,2891031,2896890,"You can see, across the shoulder with a strap,  there is a large pincushion that's resting  on the shoulder, and over one arm,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2896891,2903673,"it looks like there was a wrap of material.  ""Might I ask what you're all looking for, perhaps?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,2905081,2911301,"ROBBIE: Oh, hello!  MATT: ""Hello.""  ROBBIE: My name is Dorian. What's your name?"
h6AkvAj_hao,2911301,2918001,"MATT: ""Dorian.""  Puts the hand out towards you.  ""I am Seamstress Quatell."
h6AkvAj_hao,2918001,2925701,"""This is my establishment,  ""and you are coming at a very busy time."
h6AkvAj_hao,2925701,2934202,"""There is an event coming soon that is keeping us  ""front to back, but there might be room."
h6AkvAj_hao,2934202,2940131,"""What is it you seek?""  ROBBIE: The event. We may be attending,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2940131,2945631,"we're not certain at this point, but--  LAURA: We're definitely attending."
h6AkvAj_hao,2945631,2953261,"ROBBIE: Well.  LAURA: We're new to town  and have recently been asked to attend,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2953261,2959437,"and therefore need--  ROBBIE: Clothing, we need clothing.  We all need clothing. LAURA: We need an array of clothing."
h6AkvAj_hao,2959437,2966791,"MATT: ""Well, the timeline is very small on anything custom.  ""If you want small adjustments,"
h6AkvAj_hao,2966791,2974731,"""that can be done within the timeframe,  ""so pick up something you might like,  ""and we can go into measurements and alterations."""
h6AkvAj_hao,2974731,2980551,"ROBBIE: Lovely, so we're free to browse  if that's all right with you?  MATT: ""Of course.""  ROBBIE: Oh. Oh, how fun! LAURA: Great!"
h6AkvAj_hao,2980551,2987404,"ROBBIE: Thank you so much.  SAM: Okay, Matt, what's in the store?  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,2988541,2994361,"MATT: I would ask, more specifically,  what is it you are looking for,  and I can give you some guidance."
h6AkvAj_hao,2994361,3000471,"You do see,  there is a wide array of outfits"
h6AkvAj_hao,3000471,3007196,"with cultural touchstones from all acwoss--  ALL: All acwoss. MATT: All acwoss Exandwia!  All across Exandria. TRAVIS: Ah, La Croix!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3007196,3015714,"Pamplemousse!  (laughter)  MATT: Oh man, I am running on half energy tonight."
h6AkvAj_hao,3017911,3021890,But you see there is attire that holds the regal
h6AkvAj_hao,3022971,3028281,shoulder shelf display that a lot of noble houses  in Wildemount might hold.
h6AkvAj_hao,3028281,3034898,You could see there is an element of Nordic furs  that draw from Issylra and Othanzia.
h6AkvAj_hao,3034898,3040931,"You can see there are a large swath  of Marquesian inspirations from across the continent,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3040931,3047908,things from a beautiful jama coat  tailored for the female form that has the high collar
h6AkvAj_hao,3047908,3053271,"and the fold over in the front,  sleeves that bunch up towards the middle forearm  before cuffing at the end,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3053271,3059380,"and a beautiful dress that flows up from there.  You can see all different designs of sherwani coats,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3059381,3065031,"also themselves the short collar in the front  and a long, buttoned down, sequins in the front,  tailored well and tight to the torso"
h6AkvAj_hao,3065031,3072221,that rests to where the end of the thigh is.  You can see there are all manner of cloaks
h6AkvAj_hao,3072221,3077821,and display designs.  There are even pins and sashes
h6AkvAj_hao,3077821,3083201,that can be customized as well  with all manner of trim that are available  to place upon them.
h6AkvAj_hao,3083201,3089222,What is it that you are  considering for your character?  TALIESIN: Oh.  LAURA: Oh man.
h6AkvAj_hao,3089222,3096786,ROBBIE: If I may give you all one piece of advice  since we're browsing on our own.  The fastest way to get called out at an event
h6AkvAj_hao,3096787,3102347,"that perhaps you don't feel like you should be there,  or you're feeling insecure, is to try"
h6AkvAj_hao,3102347,3107407,"to be something that you're not.  So my piece of advice is: Whatever you're looking for,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3107407,3113607,"make sure that, even though it's lovely, it's still you.  ASHLEY: Okay.  LAURA: That's great advice, Dorian."
h6AkvAj_hao,3113607,3119107,"ASHLEY: That's great.  Should we all wear the same thing?  MARISHA: Oh, like a uniform?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3119107,3125277,"ASHLEY: No?  That's not how it works?  SAM: Could be cool.  ROBBIE: We could go with a color pattern, maybe."
h6AkvAj_hao,3125277,3131907,"Something to match to say we're all  from the same house or troop or group.  LAURA: Oh, yeah. ASHLEY: Okay, okay.  LAURA: What colors does Lord Eshteross wear?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3131907,3137909,"Do we know what his house colors are, like?  (laughter)  ROBBIE: In fair Verona!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3137909,3143339,MARISHA: He's a Gryffindor. ROBBIE: What are the Eshterosses wearing?  (laughter)  ROBBIE: What do we got?
h6AkvAj_hao,3143339,3148857,TALIESIN: I don't know. LAURA: Is there a crest?  Like the colors of a crest or something?  MATT: You haven't looked deep enough into
h6AkvAj_hao,3148857,3153717,his abode to consider there being a crest.  You do know that he took over from a previous--
h6AkvAj_hao,3154967,3160766,The family that this whole venture  was bequeathed unto had a long history.
h6AkvAj_hao,3160767,3168167,"He just came into it, but you didn't see  any sort of flashy signs of coloration  or crest designs that caught your eye."
h6AkvAj_hao,3168167,3174907,"LIAM: Just that ""kiss the cook"" apron, that's it.  MATT: Yes, that was it.  TALIESIN: I don't know what I want.  I'm not sure a uniform is it, though."
h6AkvAj_hao,3174907,3179977,TRAVIS: When I was in Uthodurn the store that I was at  was on the Deliberation Disk
h6AkvAj_hao,3179977,3186256,and there were some fancy people there.  Maybe I could wear some Uthodurnian styles?
h6AkvAj_hao,3186257,3193147,"ROBBIE: Of course, yeah, that's exactly  what I'm talking about Chetney, yes!  Something with some flair that says,  ""This is who I am, but I'm the best of where I'm from."""
h6AkvAj_hao,3193147,3198350,"TRAVIS: Yeah, like I left that place the better for it.  I came out on top!  ROBBIE: Yes, yes!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3199387,3205490,"Go look for your clothing!  TRAVIS: Well, you got anything from Uthodurn?  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,3206400,3212237,"MATT: ""That is possible.  ""Not a request we get often.  ""Come with me."""
h6AkvAj_hao,3212237,3217241,She leads you off-- TRAVIS: I'm gone.  MATT: She brings you through-- TRAVIS: Oh god.  MATT: (laughs)
h6AkvAj_hao,3217241,3225374,Through all beautiful arrays of large outfits  and displays to what you quickly assume might be
h6AkvAj_hao,3225374,3231272,the forgotten and/or discount rack.  If there was one here. TRAVIS: Looks good to me.
h6AkvAj_hao,3231272,3237123,"(laughter) Nordstrom Rack, baby.  MATT: She sifts through and  pulls out this folded endeavor."
h6AkvAj_hao,3237123,3242937,"Blows on it and dust billows off for a second.  Shakes it out, and you can see it is this"
h6AkvAj_hao,3242937,3251252,"awesome, layered, double coat.  It has a sash going into the front"
h6AkvAj_hao,3251252,3258447,that the trim off of it has a snow-type design on it.  It looks like it's evoking the idea
h6AkvAj_hao,3258447,3264006,"of icicles on the edge of a roof.  But the rest of it is a cool,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3264007,3267830,pale blue coloration with ivory around the edges.
h6AkvAj_hao,3269383,3275234,"There's no collar to it, it's just a smooth  transition down before it opens up just past the waist.  It's a nice coat. TRAVIS: Double coat,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3275235,3281428,"that's good for concealment.  MATT: ""Is this more of what you're looking for?""  TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it!  Does it come in my size?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3282967,3289707,"MATT: Holds it out and it's a bit wide.  You can tell at a glance this is  more of a dwarvish build, this."
h6AkvAj_hao,3289707,3296253,"""Shouldn't be too hard to take in, though.""  TRAVIS: What about for my head?  Is there anything matching up top?  I can't keep my dome naked."
h6AkvAj_hao,3297467,3303607,"MATT: ""We'll take you to our haberdashery floor.  ""Come with me."" TRAVIS: Haber-fuck?  MATT: Leads you upstairs and you can see--"
h6AkvAj_hao,3303607,3308671,TALIESIN: No one comes back.  (laughter)  MARISHA: That was it for Travis' second character.
h6AkvAj_hao,3308671,3317284,(laughter)  TRAVIS: Your face. ASHLEY: Killed haberdashery.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3317284,3323776,(laughter)  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3323776,3330387,MATT: Oh my god.  ROBBIE: F.C.G. in a Chetney face.  LIAM: When he comes down 10 minutes later:
h6AkvAj_hao,3330387,3335476,"(like Chetney) ""I feel a lot lighter now!""  TALIESIN: Once the wrinkles open up,  I bet it would fit all the way over."
h6AkvAj_hao,3335477,3342958,MARISHA: You could change your name to Fresh Cut Chetney.  (laughter)  MATT: So there is a beautiful floor of
h6AkvAj_hao,3342958,3352206,"all sorts of hats,  from large showy ones with feathers and wide brims,  to short, military-looking cupfold hats."
h6AkvAj_hao,3352207,3357397,There are some that have tassels that hang down  past the back of the head and there are
h6AkvAj_hao,3357397,3363647,some that have a regal point  to the front and flair out towards the back.
h6AkvAj_hao,3363647,3370407,You can see there are a number of designs here.  What kind of idea do you want to evoke with your head gear?
h6AkvAj_hao,3370407,3375526,TRAVIS: A brim is actually pretty sweet.  Some wide-brimmed hat options might be just the thing.
h6AkvAj_hao,3375527,3383067,"Because I'm short enough that if I want to disengage  from royal conversation, I just tip my chin and I'm out."
h6AkvAj_hao,3383197,3388710,"MATT: ""I can gather from your presentation  ""that you're not Marquesian, yes?""  TRAVIS: No."
h6AkvAj_hao,3388710,3394886,"MATT: ""You wish not to present as Marquesian, yes?""  TRAVIS: Correct.  MATT: ""Then allow me,"" and she reaches over"
h6AkvAj_hao,3394886,3402679,"and grabs a movable ladder and shifts it over,  climbs up to a top area, and plucks off,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3402679,3409867,"I mean, it's Errol Flynn level,  wide brim Robin Hood hat, but it pulls even further out."
h6AkvAj_hao,3409867,3416784,"We're hitting more Darkwing Duck level,  I guess I could say with this one.  TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yes!  TRAVIS: I'm in my younger years.  I'll take it! Sight unseen!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3417875,3425227,"MATT: ""Very well.""  TRAVIS: I mean, I've seen it.  MATT: ""Tailoring cost, outfit, coat, and hat combined."
h6AkvAj_hao,3425307,3433303,"""With a two-day turnaround for custom tailoring.  ""85 gold.""  (surprised screaming)"
h6AkvAj_hao,3433303,3438672,MARISHA: No!  SAM: I start rolling out of the place.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3438672,3443693,TRAVIS: You can just hear screaming through  the haberdashery going (screams).  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3443693,3448991,TALIESIN: I told them.  LAURA: Oh no! MARISHA: I wanted boots!  ROBBIE: We got to.  MARISHA: Fuck.
h6AkvAj_hao,3448991,3455177,"TRAVIS: Oh, that's good, that's good.  Let's start a tab for the whole group  and just keep note of those items."
h6AkvAj_hao,3455177,3461337,"I'm going to make sure everybody  (nervous noise) else has what they need.  MATT: ""Very well.""  TRAVIS: I'll go join the others. Don't let me keep you."
h6AkvAj_hao,3461337,3467569,I (quick footsteps) down to  the others as quickly as I can.  You guys! You guys!
h6AkvAj_hao,3467570,3474287,(heavy gasping)  ASHLEY: Are you okay?  TRAVIS: I got a coat and a hat.
h6AkvAj_hao,3474287,3479767,It was--  Is anybody listening?  TALIESIN: Hmm?  TRAVIS: Do I see anybody?
h6AkvAj_hao,3479767,3484977,It was 85 fucking gold!  MARISHA: That is a lot of money.
h6AkvAj_hao,3484977,3490655,TALIESIN: Did we not know that  this was going to be stupid expensive?  SAM: Maybe they have some sale items.  Or maybe we can talk to--
h6AkvAj_hao,3490655,3496626,LAURA: Didn't he get that from the sale rack?  SAM: Was that the sale rack?  ROBBIE: Those are a few season ago prices.  LAURA: Oh jeez.
h6AkvAj_hao,3497927,3505096,ASHLEY: Wow.  SAM: Wait.  Do these places-- SAM and MARISHA: Rent?  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3505096,3511227,LAURA: Rent the Runway! MARISHA: Western Costume.  ROBBIE: Dorian visibly cringes.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3511227,3517317,"SAM: I don't know how this is going to work.  TRAVIS: Maybe you and I could split an outfit,  if worst comes to worst."
h6AkvAj_hao,3517317,3524202,SAM: I go to the restroom for a while  while you're wearing it and then we switch off?  TRAVIS: I'll come in through the vent.
h6AkvAj_hao,3525496,3533127,ROBBIE: (displeased) Mm.  TRAVIS: We should ask about the rental.  SAM: We should ask about group rates or rentals
h6AkvAj_hao,3533127,3539147,"or maybe, you know, I could try to use  some of my magical charms to convince her"
h6AkvAj_hao,3539147,3547267,to give us a discount or something.  LAURA: I mean--  TRAVIS: Also.  Maybe we just invest in a few of us going in.
h6AkvAj_hao,3547267,3554368,"Because I don't need to go in there.  Truly, I appreciate the thought, but fuck!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3555850,3560320,"SAM: I would also take one for the team,  and as much as I want to wear pants,"
h6AkvAj_hao,3562342,3567927,the alternate I was thinking of is if we  cut out a little round sort of hat for me
h6AkvAj_hao,3567927,3574468,"and draped a table cloth over me, I could be like  a two-top that just--"
h6AkvAj_hao,3574468,3582180,TRAVIS: Rolls around?  SAM: -- follows you wherever you go.  No one would know I was there.  MARISHA: You don't have to wait for a ball to wear pants.
h6AkvAj_hao,3583137,3589117,"We can achieve that whenever you want.  SAM: You're right. All right.  ROBBIE: I don't think it'll take much for you, F.C.G."
h6AkvAj_hao,3589117,3593690,"Maybe a little metal, or a piece of flair, or something.  You're amazing as-is. Polish you up."
h6AkvAj_hao,3594637,3602396,"SAM: Okay.  LIAM: Maybe the thing to do is to show you off,  as a distraction, so other people"
h6AkvAj_hao,3602396,3607977,can slide about.  SAM: Don't worry about me too much.  I get this weird feeling that Imogen really wants
h6AkvAj_hao,3607977,3613287,"to dress up so maybe we should ask about--  TRAVIS: Renting?  LAURA: No, I really, I mean--"
h6AkvAj_hao,3614577,3621298,"No.  MATT: ""So what else can I get for you?""  MARISHA: Ooh!"
h6AkvAj_hao,3621298,3626781,"ROBBIE: We're just browsing, window shopping. I suppose.  MARISHA: We were curious."
h6AkvAj_hao,3626781,3632207,"MATT: ""Yes?""  MARISHA: Can we just rent these or borrow these"
h6AkvAj_hao,3632207,3638286,for the night and then we'll bring them back?  TRAVIS: With collateral?
h6AkvAj_hao,3638287,3643817,"MATT: ""If you wish to have them as-is,  ""that might be considerable, but anything"
h6AkvAj_hao,3643817,3651920,"""with tailoring must be a purchase.""  LAURA: How much do the gowns run?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3652887,3661857,"MATT: ""That depends on  ""where it's from, the material utilized,  ""and who the designer was, but let me show you."""
h6AkvAj_hao,3661857,3666006,She shows you across
h6AkvAj_hao,3668167,3675799,"an almost Victorian-style dress that gives  a schoolteacher look, but a little nicer."
h6AkvAj_hao,3677307,3681442,"""This was one of the imports from Tal'Dorei."
h6AkvAj_hao,3683147,3690268,"""Seems to be close to your size.  ""I also have a balintawak, which is a beautiful dress"

h6AkvAj_hao,3696977,3704295,"as well as this beautiful dress, pointed shoulders.  This awesome head scarf wrap"
h6AkvAj_hao,3704295,3710087,with a design across the front  and it ends at the mid-arm around there.
h6AkvAj_hao,3710087,3716737,"This beautiful gold design, like  a peacock pattern that's woven into it,  and the dress itself billows out."
h6AkvAj_hao,3716737,3722227,It looks very pretty.  LAURA: Wow.  MARISHA: It looks very expensive.  LAURA: That looks ostentatious.
h6AkvAj_hao,3722227,3728105,That would attract attention rather than...  MARISHA: That looks like  our entire budget. TALEISIN: Don't you want  to attract attention?
h6AkvAj_hao,3728105,3736857,"LAURA: Yeah, yeah.  TRAVIS: How much is it?  MATT: ""If you're wishing to take it temporarily,"

h6AkvAj_hao,3757866,3764097,LAURA: Okay.  ASHLEY: Sheesh.  ROBBIE: I'm not telling you how to spend your money.  Of course not.
h6AkvAj_hao,3764097,3771157,"But an event like this, I'm just saying,  it's up there with a wedding or a graduation."
h6AkvAj_hao,3771337,3777017,"This is a once a year at most,  perhaps even once a decade event--  LAURA: I've never been to a ball.  ROBBIE: If you're going to spend the money"
h6AkvAj_hao,3777017,3783547,"on something fabulous, this is the time to do it.  LAURA: Yeah.  ROBBIE: But, but, that's just, you do you, you know?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3783547,3790347,"MARISHA: Maybe Eshteross could give us a stipend.  LAURA: Yeah, or maybe we can find a thrift store."
h6AkvAj_hao,3790347,3797017,"MARISHA: Or maybe we could find a thrift store.  TALIESIN: For some of us, that's a great idea.  Don't fuck around with this."
h6AkvAj_hao,3797017,3802750,"Get the dress.  TRAVIS: Yeah, get the dress.  LAURA: You know, here's the thing.  Dorian made a big-- ASHLEY: (chants) Get the dress!  LAURA: No, no--"

h6AkvAj_hao,3821772,3827517,LAURA: Can I come out with these big (laughs).  ROBBIE: How does she--  LAURA: You know.
h6AkvAj_hao,3827517,3833157,I just--  LIAM: We're playing dress up and there's nothing there.  MATT: They're not bladed shoulder pads.
h6AkvAj_hao,3833157,3840895,They just come to a nice point.  TRAVIS: Legion of Doom with spikes.  MATT: World of Warcraft style armor shoulder pads.
h6AkvAj_hao,3840895,3846298,LAURA: I fully pictured World of Warcraft like.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,3846299,3850730,"LAURA: You know, Dorian made a point to say  dress like yourself, feel like yourself."

h6AkvAj_hao,3863327,3868965,"individually shopping for each of your outfits  and decide whether or not this is what  you're looking for, nah, something else."
h6AkvAj_hao,3868966,3874957,(laughter)  MATT: How about--  SAM: I didn't like how Matt described that.
h6AkvAj_hao,3874957,3880662,(laughter)  MATT: How about you inform me the look--  LAURA: Have I mentioned I spend hours  in custom creation in video games?
h6AkvAj_hao,3880663,3887467,"MATT: No, I understand, which is why I'm saying you let me  know what kind of look you're looking for and how close  we can get to it and what the cost would be."
h6AkvAj_hao,3887467,3893337,LAURA: Just something simple.  Something real simple.  Like a sheath dress.
h6AkvAj_hao,3893337,3899237,"Or, you know, just--  MATT: ""How about a kebaya?""  LAURA: What is that?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3899237,3906266,MATT: She shows you over to this wonderful ensemble  that has an open-collar design.
h6AkvAj_hao,3906267,3911377,It's a simple top with these beautiful  bell sleeves and simple clothes in the front
h6AkvAj_hao,3911377,3917137,"and this long dress that folds in the front,  but it's all beautifully-detailed pattern."
h6AkvAj_hao,3917137,3924026,"It's simple. It doesn't necessarily seem  ostentatious or a grab for the eye,  but still has a formal look to it."
h6AkvAj_hao,3925147,3933187,"You've seen other individuals in the city  in the Lucent Spire with similar such attire,  so it seems like it would fit very well."
h6AkvAj_hao,3933187,3938477,"LAURA: All right.  Yeah, sure.  Why is nobody else shopping?  All right, sure, I'll do that."
h6AkvAj_hao,3938477,3944667,"I'll buy that.  How much for that?  MATT: ""35 gold.""  LAURA: 35 gold.  TRAVIS: I'll revise my order."
h6AkvAj_hao,3944667,3953817,"I don't need the cloak or the hat  because the markup got crazy.  85, are you nuts?  Do you have any just single women's dresses?"
h6AkvAj_hao,3953817,3961032,"Sleeveless so I can put the vibe out  and let them see the guns?  MATT: ""That can be arranged, yes."""

h6AkvAj_hao,4936539,4943939,"as Quatell closes out the final elements  of paperwork and gifts to each of you,"
h6AkvAj_hao,4943939,4949176,the outfits that are ready to go.  LAURA: What color was my outfit?  I could choose-- MATT: You can choose.
h6AkvAj_hao,4949176,4955712,LAURA: That's great.  MARISHA: I didn't choose either.  What's your color?  LAURA: I think mine would just be something subtle.
h6AkvAj_hao,4955712,4960785,"Chetney went with a silver,  but I think I'd also go with a cream color.  MARISHA: Oh, that's nice."
h6AkvAj_hao,4960786,4966915,"TALIESIN: I feel like we can all  do interesting descriptions once we're actually  at the ball. LAURA: Yeah, okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,4966915,4972226,TALIESIN: Have some time to think about it.  LAURA: That's great.  Are you going with black?
h6AkvAj_hao,4972226,4977482,"MARISHA: I was thinking it's a dark chocolate brown.  LAURA: (gasps) Oh, Laudna, that's lovely. MARISHA: Like it kind of looks black."
h6AkvAj_hao,4977482,4983136,"But when I turn in the light,  you can kind of see the brown.  ASHLEY: Ooh. LAURA: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,4983136,4992509,ASHLEY: Svelte and beauty. LAURA: (gasps) Yeah!  It's gorgeous.  ASHLEY: You could tell-- just wait until you see your friends.
h6AkvAj_hao,4992509,4996399,SAM: I can't wait to have some.  ASHLEY: I wonder if Pussy would like one of these.
h6AkvAj_hao,4998546,5004921,"SAM: Possibly.  I mean, Pussy didn't really have a lot  of opinions about things.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,5004921,5012130,ASHLEY: How strange.  SAM: I mean-- LAURA: Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
h6AkvAj_hao,5012130,5020636,"MATT: ""Thank you all so much for coming.""  (laughter) TALIESIN: Save him.  MATT: ""If ever any future events are to transpire"
h6AkvAj_hao,5020637,5026386,"""and you wish to outfit yourselves  ""with the finest available here  ""in the Oderan Wilds and beyond,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5026387,5032234,"""you're ever welcome at The Golden Veil.""  SAM: Thank you so much for the discount."
h6AkvAj_hao,5033711,5039559,"Thank you, Fearne, for sweet talking her  out of me being charged."
h6AkvAj_hao,5039559,5045708,ASHLEY: She said that she might make more of these.  ASHLEY: She said that she might make more of these.
h6AkvAj_hao,5045708,5050989,SAM: I don't know why she would do that.  ASHLEY: She said that there might be more
h6AkvAj_hao,5050989,5057369,of your type coming in to shop.  LAURA: More associates.
h6AkvAj_hao,5057369,5060815,"ASHLEY: Yeah, what was that?  SAM: Well, it's just,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5062532,5068309,"that's how I referred to Dancer.  She was my associate.  ASHLEY: Well, what's the designation bit?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5068309,5074928,"SAM: Oh, well, that's just my purpose.  LAURA: Oh!  ASHLEY: Your special purpose? SAM: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,5074929,5079929,"Just to help you living folk,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5080552,5086532,make sure that you're okay.  TRAVIS: You remember Dancer's designation?
h6AkvAj_hao,5086532,5096014,"SAM: No, no, no, she gave me mine.  TRAVIS: Oh. Oh right. Yeah.  SAM: Yeah, she made me and gave me"
h6AkvAj_hao,5096889,5100364,my intent.  LAURA: Wow.
h6AkvAj_hao,5103839,5109039,I probably wouldn't know anything about that spell  that was used on him to turn him into a turtle.
h6AkvAj_hao,5109039,5113934,"Would I know anything about that?  MATT: You can roll an arcana check, if you want to."
h6AkvAj_hao,5114905,5121558,LAURA: Sure.  16.  MATT: 16. You don't know what the spell is.
h6AkvAj_hao,5121559,5128799,"You've never seen something like that before,  but as a person who instinctually"
h6AkvAj_hao,5129003,5134003,"can figure out some elements of the weave of arcana,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5134739,5141109,there are some facets that anchor into your mind.  You gather that it has to deal with the transmutation
h6AkvAj_hao,5141109,5147598,"of one body into another-- LAURA: Yeah.  MATT: -- seemingly focused on bestial shapes,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5147599,5153466,"but that's the extent.  LAURA: I just, I feel like--"
h6AkvAj_hao,5155859,5162217,Spells can't turn a chair into an animal.  Spells can't turn a chair into an animal.
h6AkvAj_hao,5162339,5169039,"Do you know what I mean? SAM: No.  LAURA: I don't think they can turn something inanimate,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5169039,5177172,"something that isn't living, into something that is.  SAM: So you're saying I must be alive"
h6AkvAj_hao,5177172,5182719,to be turned into something else alive?  LAURA: Exactly.  I don't think you give yourself enough credit.
h6AkvAj_hao,5185289,5187320,SAM: That's interesting.
h6AkvAj_hao,5190575,5196789,"I don't know.  I mean, I don't breathe or eat or--  LAURA: But you think."
h6AkvAj_hao,5198124,5205662,"LIAM: Is there anything you want?  SAM: Sure.  Lots of things,  but I want you all to get what you want first."
h6AkvAj_hao,5207369,5213674,"But yeah, I want things.  I need to find out who did that to--"
h6AkvAj_hao,5214532,5223452,"to my friends,  and figure out if I can get them some sort of,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5223579,5227570,"not vengeance, but just sort of justice, I suppose?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5229199,5234499,I'd like to find out what I am.  That would be nice.
h6AkvAj_hao,5234499,5240553,And if there's more of me.  LAURA: I wonder if I can research that in a library.  SAM: That would be amazing.
h6AkvAj_hao,5240554,5245014,"LAURA: I'm going to write it down.  SAM: Okay.  I can come with, if you need."
h6AkvAj_hao,5246459,5253341,"LAURA: Maybe we can get you in,  depending on how we present you. SAM: I could be a two-top, you know?  A table that follows you around."
h6AkvAj_hao,5253341,5260519,(laughter)  TALIESIN: I feel like this is some other desire  that we're not talking about is your two-top thing.
h6AkvAj_hao,5260519,5267074,"Is this a--  TRAVIS: I live to serve.  SAM: I have a table kink.  TALIESIN: I was going to say, this feels like something."
h6AkvAj_hao,5268019,5273549,To be fair. No judgment.  MARISHA: If we cut a hole in the middle of the table top
h6AkvAj_hao,5273549,5279449,"and put it over your head,  then you'd just be a head on the table.  You could be the centerpiece."
h6AkvAj_hao,5279449,5284452,"SAM: Well, that's kind of cool.  MARISHA: Yes. LAURA: That is pretty cool.  MARISHA: We could put little pieces of lettuce under you."
h6AkvAj_hao,5284452,5292117,(laughter) MATT: What?!  LAURA: What else do we have to do?  (laughter)  MATT: You have a handful of days before--
h6AkvAj_hao,5292117,5297969,"TRAVIS: Do we leave with our garments  or do we have to go back and pick them up, or--?  MATT: For those who needed heavy customization,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5297969,5303477,which I believe is  mainly just yours. LIAM: Sleeves coming off?  MATT: Which it wasn't heavy.  That one would be ready later in the day.
h6AkvAj_hao,5303477,5309979,"LIAM: Okay.  MATT: But most of you guys pulled existing outfits  that existed from there  and had minor alterations tailored,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5309979,5316670,so they'll be ready within the next day or two at most.  TALIESIN: A quick potion and magic run  is the only thing I can think of.
h6AkvAj_hao,5316670,5320745,TRAVIS: Yeah. LAURA: Yeah.  MATT: Where abouts?
h6AkvAj_hao,5322066,5327259,TALIESIN: I'm trying to remember.  TRAVIS: Trove of Marwa or the Prism Emporium.
h6AkvAj_hao,5327259,5332869,"TALIESIN: Prism's kind of iffy,  if I recall, right? LAURA: Something specifically not  in the Core Spire would be great."
h6AkvAj_hao,5332869,5338948,"TRAVIS: Oh yeah, Prism's in the Core Spire.  TALIESIN: Trove it is.  MATT: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,5338949,5345259,"So you head from the Core Spire,  which another gondola ride."
h6AkvAj_hao,5345259,5350705,It's a silver.  LAURA: We're terrible at this.  MATT: It's how the city makes its money.
h6AkvAj_hao,5350705,5357297,TRAVIS: Who am I covering this time?  LIAM: Me every time. TALIESIN: I'm fine.  TRAVIS: Every time? LIAM: Every time.
h6AkvAj_hao,5357297,5362763,TRAVIS: Shit.  LIAM: Because he took all your money.  (laughter)  TRAVIS: Two silver.
h6AkvAj_hao,5362764,5368311,"LAURA: Didn't you get a whole lot of money, Chetney?  TRAVIS: Yeah, I gave some of it out, too."
h6AkvAj_hao,5368311,5373747,"ROBBIE: I don't think we ever knew that, though, did we?  TALIESIN: I don't think I ever put-- MARISHA: You didn't.  You two are the only ones that know that."
h6AkvAj_hao,5373747,5379769,"ROBBIE: I don't know it.  LAURA: Well, I knew you found a bag.  You told me about that."
h6AkvAj_hao,5379769,5385009,"TALIESIN: What was in the bag?  TRAVIS: I just whittle away on the gondola ride.  LAURA: What was in the bag, Chetney?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5385009,5390411,TRAVIS: Money. LAURA: How much?  TRAVIS: A lot.  TALIESIN: (laughs)
h6AkvAj_hao,5390411,5394855,"LAURA: Oh, really? TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.  LAURA: Enough to cover a bunch of fancy clothes?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5396879,5400826,TRAVIS: (uncertain noise)  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,5402256,5406185,TRAVIS: No. (laughter)  LIAM: How about half?
h6AkvAj_hao,5408059,5413294,"TRAVIS: You know, it's all so abstract.  LAURA: In your head you hear: Are you lying to me, Chetney?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5413294,5419292,"TRAVIS: Ah, balls.  Balls? LAURA: Yeah? What about them?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5419292,5425069,"TRAVIS: Balls.  (laughter)  TALIESIN: It's like in your head was the truth,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5425069,5430830,"and you were slowly whittling away at it.  TRAVIS: All right, fine! There was a lot of money in the bag!  Like 80 platinum."
h6AkvAj_hao,5430830,5436611,LAURA: (gasps) TALIESIN: Jeez!  Fuck!  MARISHA: We're about to go search for other items.  Maybe you can come in handy then.
h6AkvAj_hao,5437579,5443209,TRAVIS: I'm very frugal.  LAURA: All right. ASHLEY: 80 platinum.
h6AkvAj_hao,5443209,5449002,"TRAVIS: Like I said, I can be a resource.  I give favorable rates for loans."
h6AkvAj_hao,5450129,5455519,"SAM: It's a lot of dinners.  LAURA: It's a lot of dinners, Chet.  TRAVIS: But I'm paying for gondola rides so far."
h6AkvAj_hao,5455519,5461909,"LAURA: For him!  TRAVIS: Well, yeah.  They paid Artana Voe like 10, 30 gold each or whatever."
h6AkvAj_hao,5461909,5467509,I had to pay it back.  LIAM: 100. TRAVIS: 100 gold.
h6AkvAj_hao,5467509,5474949,I'll give you 70 more gold.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,5474949,5480829,"TRAVIS: Fuck. Shit!  LIAM: Do I see-- When he opens the bag,  can I see how much there is in there?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5480829,5487199,"MATT: Make a perception check.  TALIESIN: I believe in you.  LIAM: Yeah, that's a 23."
h6AkvAj_hao,5487199,5493209,MATT: 23. Are you trying to hide the contents of your bag?  TRAVIS: Didn't know I needed to.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,5493209,5497449,"No, I'm not.  MATT: It's a sizeable amount of coin."
h6AkvAj_hao,5499899,5505779,"LIAM: Thanks for the gold, Chet.  TRAVIS: You're welcome.  MATT: Now, not having to gondola ride"
h6AkvAj_hao,5505779,5511551,"to the Lantern Spire, as there is  the Fatewalk Bridge that leads you there.  You push through the midday crowd"
h6AkvAj_hao,5511551,5516599,"to the exterior of the Trove of Marwa,  which you've seen at a distance,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5516599,5522539,but haven't approached as it looks like a building  built out of a shipwreck in the middle of a city
h6AkvAj_hao,5522539,5527999,"in the Oderan Wilds.  So whether there was a ship here  and then they just hollowed it out and made a building,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5527999,5533649,"or they brought pieces of a ship to decorate it,  but in the middle of all these various shapes"
h6AkvAj_hao,5533649,5538949,"and the heights of structures  in this industrial district here  in the the upper echelon of the Lantern Spire,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5538949,5544340,"you see this cocked and upward-angled sunken ship,  you see this cocked and upward-angled sunken ship,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5544340,5550939,but out in the open air.  You can see port holes along the side.  There is moss growing on the edges
h6AkvAj_hao,5550939,5558304,"from the moist jungle atmosphere,  and you can see different plants and flowers  have taken root in elements."
h6AkvAj_hao,5559189,5566886,TALIESIN: I genuinely don't know how I've never been in here.  ASHLEY: This is cool.  SAM: Which spire are we on? LAURA: The Lantern Spire.
h6AkvAj_hao,5566887,5572629,TRAVIS: I take out my notepad and I just start sketching  without taking my eyes off of the ship.  Inspiration striking.
h6AkvAj_hao,5572629,5578787,"I grab the wood and start working.  TALIESIN: Oh yeah, it's because I never  give a fuck up here, that's why.  MATT: You enter the interior,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5578787,5584459,"and while it is a beautifully intricate,  almost art piece-like structure,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5584459,5592312,"it is a bit cramped in there.  It looks like everything may have actually been built  out of a ship, (laughs)  because it is just a crushed, low interior."
h6AkvAj_hao,5592312,5598749,"There are blue lanterns  that give this bluish glow to the inside.  The smell's a bit musty,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5598749,5607893,and you hear this single sound of a music box.  ♪ Ding ding ding ding ding ♪
h6AkvAj_hao,5609022,5614569,There is a music box  in the center back of the room  that's just playing on its own.  TRAVIS: Burn it down.
h6AkvAj_hao,5614569,5620681,"TALIESIN: I walk over and tap it.  MATT: Okay, you tap it."
h6AkvAj_hao,5620682,5626369,"""Yes?"" (gasping)  MATT: Suddenly out from behind the counter,  a young human girl,"
h6AkvAj_hao,5626369,5632046,"beautiful, dark tan skin,  black hair that's cut to a bob  that's a bit scattered and wild."
h6AkvAj_hao,5632046,5638811,She has her hair  pulled up with a band that's wrapped behind.  Big leather gloves on and a bit of a smear on one arm.
h6AkvAj_hao,5638811,5643959,"Leans forward towards your face.  TALIESIN: Fuck. (laughs)  MATT: ""Hi."" TALIESIN: (laughs) Hi!  MATT: ""Can I help you?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5643959,5649149,"""What are you doing? You're here.""  TALIESIN: Well, first off, we're here to shop."
h6AkvAj_hao,5649149,5655807,"Secondly, is this real  or is this just a deep commitment to a bit?  MATT: ""Yes."""
h6AkvAj_hao,5655808,5660859,"(laughter)  MATT: ""Great, shopping. That's awesome."

h6AkvAj_hao,5673139,5678479,"and just chugs a bunch of water  and it spills down the chin.  (slurps) ""Anyway."
h6AkvAj_hao,5678479,5684049,"""So what can I do?  ""What can I do for you?""  TALIESIN: First off, I have to know your name."
h6AkvAj_hao,5684049,5688782,"I don't care about a lot of people's names,  but I have to know yours.  Please."
h6AkvAj_hao,5689969,5698779,"MATT: ""You first.""  TALIESIN: Aaron.  TRAVIS: (laughs) LAURA: Aaron?  (laughter) MARISHA: What?"
h6AkvAj_hao,5698779,5705328,"TALIESIN: I was trying to think of a bullshit name  and I couldn't think of one.  I freaked out.  ASHLEY: Aaron?  TALIESIN: I freaked out. I was Byron, and then it just--"
h6AkvAj_hao,5705329,5711013,"TRAVIS: That was a nosedive.  MATT: ""That's so weird.  ""That's my name, too.""  TALIESIN: Ashton. My name's Ashton."
h6AkvAj_hao,5711013,5718419,"I give the fuck up. I'm not good at that.  I'm just not fucking good at it.  MATT: ""Just the slightest bit of forthrightness,"

h6AkvAj_hao,5744709,5750689,"MATT: You can't quite place the exact age,  but you expect to be either,  somewhere around 20."
h6AkvAj_hao,5750689,5758379,"ROBBIE: Oh. An adult. MATT: Very young.  Yeah, like a very young adult.  But there is definitely a chaotic air"
h6AkvAj_hao,5758379,5763769,of a-- TRAVIS: Jubilee.  MATT: A child given responsibility and making the best of it.
h6AkvAj_hao,5763769,5770549,"MARISHA: Cool.  LIAM: We're on the hunt for healing potions mostly,  but are also just curious about whatever is interesting."

h6AkvAj_hao,5785379,5792269,"and then heads downstairs, (footsteps)  deeper into the ship hold.  You begin to hear some (rustling),"
h6AkvAj_hao,5792269,5797319,"some rustling something being pushed over.  Something's being shifted.  Some heavy coughs (coughs),"
h6AkvAj_hao,5797319,5803244,and you see some dust from underneath.  Eventually you hear some dragging sounds.
h6AkvAj_hao,5803244,5809939,"Comes up, you can see this  new layer of soot across her whole face.  Wipes the edge the brow, sets it."

h6AkvAj_hao,5871819,5878499,ASHLEY: I'm pretty sure this is a healing potion  from what I can smell.

h6AkvAj_hao,6803593,6805751,whatever's left in there.
h6AkvAj_hao,6809067,6814905,"MATT: ""No, that's reforming in there.""  Looking at it, you can see where after  the bottle had been uncorked, it was emptied,"
h6AkvAj_hao,6814905,6820006,and now you can see there's a little bit  of this mercury-like viscous liquid  that's flowing inside.
h6AkvAj_hao,6820006,6825983,"You can see it slowly increasing.  So like, ""So looks like it'll little reform in about a day."
h6AkvAj_hao,6825983,6831941,"TRAVIS: Oh!  MATT: ""So this is still functional, my friend.  ""If I'm looking at this right--"

h6AkvAj_hao,6850263,6858052,"It is going through old receipts.  TRAVIS: H&R Block, here we go again.  MATT: ""This is an Eversmoking Bottle,"

h6AkvAj_hao,6903673,6909405,"TALIESIN: A sword is not a component.  ASHLEY: Just a few pieces. TALIESIN: I mean, I guess  technically it is.  MATT: ""Oh yeah, all right, let me--"

h6AkvAj_hao,6921463,6927113,"of very delicately labeled minerals.  You can see them all placed into small, little jars"
h6AkvAj_hao,6927113,6935056,"or receptacles and they're all independently labeled across,  like a mineral collection, if you will."
h6AkvAj_hao,6935057,6942907,"TALIESIN: Oh.  MATT: She pulls out a shelf from underneath,  and counts out these small, dark, flakings of glass"

h6AkvAj_hao,7196723,7203063,before pulling it out and sets it on the counter  and you can see it's a yellowed glass eye.  MARISHA: Oh.  MATT: It's been weathered enough to the point where
h6AkvAj_hao,7203063,7208233,"it's getting a darker yellow coloration.  The iris is a bright, vibrant blue,"
h6AkvAj_hao,7208233,7215203,"but because of the discoloration,  it's starting to turn more of a sea green.  LIAM: Does it seem to corrupt or radiate extreme evil?"

h6AkvAj_hao,7258089,7264432,"and assembling the pieces of what she could find.  There is a coil of multi-used copper wire,"
h6AkvAj_hao,7264433,7270656,"but it functions for what you need.  There are a number of these clay figurines that are all,"
h6AkvAj_hao,7271543,7276816,what's that arrangement of small children that you--  MARISHA: Precious Moments.

h6AkvAj_hao,7292938,7298513,from long-emptied jugs of dark green glass  and the corks are assembled in place.

h6AkvAj_hao,7663533,7669990,ASHLEY: Nope.  I'm going to take out the glass egg  and I'm going to put it on there  and I'm going to leave.
h6AkvAj_hao,7669990,7675685,"MATT: Okay. LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: Whoa!  TALIESIN: That's a flex.  TRAVIS: Wow, there was some struggle there.  ASHLEY: There was some struggle."
h6AkvAj_hao,7675685,7682134,"TALIESIN: That was a flex.  TRAVIS: Okay. TALIESIN: That's impressive.  LAURA: I feel like we've witnessed some growth.  ASHLEY: No, no, heavens no."
h6AkvAj_hao,7682134,7688193,This is--  MATT: After you all are pushed out into the midday sun here
h6AkvAj_hao,7688193,7695199,"in the streets of the Lantern Spire,  a moment later you hear,  ""Oh fuck, there it is!"

h6AkvAj_hao,7707234,7713273,because we're taking a break.  MARISHA: All that shopping! ROBBIE: Shopping!  TRAVIS: We're so much poorer now.  We've spent some money.
h6AkvAj_hao,7713273,7720362,TALIESIN: Yep. LAURA: Spent money.  MATT: You spent some money.  We've got some fun stuff in the interim.  ASHLEY: She was all alone!  She was her own shop just all on her own.
h6AkvAj_hao,7720362,7725913,"MARISHA: It works for creepy magic!  I'm going to go back and buy it!  SAM: We have to go back and talk to her. ASHLEY: I had to, I had to."
h6AkvAj_hao,7725913,7731332,"LIAM: I really thought you were going to say,  ""I drop a deuce on her front door.""  (laughter)"

h6AkvAj_hao,7766813,7773305,"Normally in these videos, I'm kind of funny and charming,  but I'm in a bit of a situation.  I'm in a dungeon with Sam!"
h6AkvAj_hao,7775093,7780733,"Okay, here's the thing.  If you buy a premium edition  of Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn"

h6AkvAj_hao,7867050,7872748,"Well, you see. (wall crashing)  We don't exactly have any money on us per se,  but if you give me five-"

h6AkvAj_hao,7885060,7891100,Does this mean we're officially banned  from every tavern in Emon?  Wonderful.
h6AkvAj_hao,7891100,7897100,"We have no money, no place to live,  and fuck all for prospects.  Well, perhaps if someone didn't"
h6AkvAj_hao,7897100,7902300,"accidentally decapitate the last fellow who hired us.  Well I apologized, didn't I?"
h6AkvAj_hao,7902300,7909820,"We have a mountain of debts and, oh god,  three silver to our name.  We need a job. Anything at this point."
h6AkvAj_hao,7909820,7916140,"I mean, if protecting carts from swindlers  and killing goblins for gold isn't getting us anywhere,"
h6AkvAj_hao,7916140,7921520,"I don't know, maybe,  maybe we could try doing some good this time?"

h6AkvAj_hao,8148926,8156406,"Hey dweebs.  Now as your president, I've been kinda killing it lately.  I gave global warming an atomic wedgie."
h6AkvAj_hao,8156406,8162896,"I balanced the budget by selling my Pog collection,  and I saved the Queen of England from that octopus!"
h6AkvAj_hao,8162896,8172046,"But my kick-assery is far from done.  According to this chart that I made,  an estimated 35% of you are still a bunch of nasty goobers,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8172046,8178006,"but don't worry, I have a plan.  Operation: Gag Me With A Spoon."
h6AkvAj_hao,8178006,8186496,"It's easy sleazy.  According to this study that I wrote,  if every citizen subscribed to Critical Role on Twitch,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8186496,8191496,we could reduce maximum goobage by a metric buttload.
h6AkvAj_hao,8191656,8197046,Twitch is the only place where you'll get  a live and moderated chat and when you subscribe
h6AkvAj_hao,8197046,8203506,"to Critical Role, you instantly get access  to all their shows as soon as the live broadcast ends."
h6AkvAj_hao,8203506,8209395,"So while you're oogling those Critical Role dorks  with their sick goof-em-ups and their nerdy voices,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8209396,8216345,"think of me, Gale, the current president of whatever.  Now I gotta go make a fresh batch of spitballs,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8216345,8222286,"but I guess I have some time for your boring questions.  You.  Reporter: Gale, is it true that if you subscribe"
h6AkvAj_hao,8222286,8227506,"to Critical Role through Prime Gaming,  you have to resubscribe every month?  Uh, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,8227506,8233416,I do it right after my monthly prank call to Pee-an O'Brien.  Next question.  Reporter: Does Critical Role
h6AkvAj_hao,8233416,8238725,"have exclusive emotes for their subscribers?  Uh, doy. Of course they do."
h6AkvAj_hao,8238725,8244796,"I like the hello bees one, 'cause bees are cool.  I replaced my whole security detail with a bunch of bees"
h6AkvAj_hao,8244796,8251326,"that think I'm their queen.  Last question.  Reporter: Yeah, with all due respect,  is Operation: Gag Me With a Spoon a real policy,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8251326,8256845,or are you mad goofin'?  Am I mad goofin'?
h6AkvAj_hao,8256845,8264566,"What, do you see me scarfing Milk Duds  while doodling ding-dongs in the SkyMall catalog?  Listen, I know I'm new to this."
h6AkvAj_hao,8264566,8270336,"And I admit that when I made the wish  to be the boss of everything, I did not know"
h6AkvAj_hao,8270336,8276794,"the witch that works at Woolworth's was listening.  Well, Faustian bargain or not, I am the president"
h6AkvAj_hao,8276794,8284696,"and I have an obligation to lead this country.  So to answer your question, no, I am not mad goofin'."
h6AkvAj_hao,8284696,8290173,"Security, take him out.  (bees buzzing)  (Gale laughing)"
h6AkvAj_hao,8290844,8292427,"Later, chudruckers!"
h6AkvAj_hao,8420016,8425544,"MATT: Welcome back.  So, the group of you have"
h6AkvAj_hao,8425544,8432249,"a little under three days,  four or three days before the ball occurs."
h6AkvAj_hao,8432249,8438729,What else would you like to do in the interim?  SAM: ♪ Balls ♪  LAURA: I think we should see if we can get back
h6AkvAj_hao,8438729,8442882,into the Lumas House and look for pages.
h6AkvAj_hao,8444071,8450318,"TALIESIN: Do you want a small group or a big group for that?  LAURA: I mean, it's really up to you to see  what you think would be appropriate."
h6AkvAj_hao,8451159,8458229,"LIAM: Yeah, I think that I could probably navigate  that reintroduction, I guess."
h6AkvAj_hao,8458229,8463429,"Why don't we keep it small?  So they don't feel like, ""Eh!""  So many. LAURA: Yeah, that's fine."
h6AkvAj_hao,8463429,8470122,"LIAM: Okay.  LAURA: I would like to go research every night,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8470122,8475414,"if I can, before the ball and just go back and--  MATT: You have access, so-- LAURA: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,8475414,8482859,"MATT: Okay.  TRAVIS: I have a question.  We were in that shop and, you know,  he asked like, ""Who are you guys?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,8482859,8491030,"I know we talked about business prior, but like,  you don't have a moniker that you go by?  Has this always been the group that you've run with, or--?"
h6AkvAj_hao,8491030,8496124,MARISHA: It's been a work in progress.  LIAM: Everybody asks.
h6AkvAj_hao,8496124,8501717,"LAURA: I know, we really need to--  ROBBIE: It's bothering me, too.  Our last group didn't have a name."
h6AkvAj_hao,8501717,8507212,"LIAM: We tried. ROBBIE: Yeah, we tried.  It's tough.  It's really hard. ASHLEY: Yeah.  LIAM: You want it to mean something."
h6AkvAj_hao,8507212,8513549,ROBBIE: Yeah.  ASHLEY: We didn't land on anything?  We didn't land on anything.  TRAVIS: The last group?  ASHLEY: No.  ROBBIE: We had a group of friends that we traveled with
h6AkvAj_hao,8513549,8518604,"for a bit of time before we joined ourselves.  TRAVIS: Oh!  Oh, that's right. Yes, you met."
h6AkvAj_hao,8518604,8524189,"SAM: I also was part of a group before this,  and so was Ashton.  ROBBIE: Did they have a name?  SAM: They did. They did."
h6AkvAj_hao,8524189,8531205,It was called  The Division of Public Benefit.  TRAVIS and ROBBIE: The DPB? TALIESIN: Huh.
h6AkvAj_hao,8531205,8536595,SAM: Mm-hmm.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,8536595,8542182,LIAM: Pithy. LAURA: You're such an asshole.  TRAVIS: The Division of Public Benefit.  ROBBIE: Lengthy--
h6AkvAj_hao,8542182,8548709,"TRAVIS: That's a long one.  SAM: The Division, it was short. MARISHA: The Division.  LIAM: Way to carry that forward.  LAURA: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,8548709,8554785,MARISHA: I tried to announce the New Nobodies and I just--  TALIESIN: I kind of--
h6AkvAj_hao,8555909,8563339,"MARISHA: Does it bring back trauma?  ROBBIE: Yeah, what happened to the old Nobodies?  You told us, right?  TALIESIN: They fucked off, which is fine,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8563339,8568339,"but yeah, moving backward is never a good plan."
h6AkvAj_hao,8568979,8575739,"I'm not a big fan of moving backward, forward,  and you know, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,8575739,8582438,"LIAM: I mean, what  thematically brings this group together?"
h6AkvAj_hao,8582438,8588329,"MARISHA: Death!  ROBBIE: Furniture. TALIESIN: Death!  Money, furniture.  LAURA and MARISHA: Furniture!  TRAVIS: Why furniture?"
h6AkvAj_hao,8588329,8593510,"LAURA: Because we've been killing a lot of furniture.  I mean, the first time we met was because of the furniture  and then Bertrand pulled us in."
h6AkvAj_hao,8593510,8598992,"ROBBIE: I almost got killed by a rock.  MARISHA: The Furnies. (laughs)  TRAVIS: Who pulled you in?  LAURA: Bertrand.  I mean, that does make sense."
h6AkvAj_hao,8598992,8605310,"SAM: Oh, he was this nice old man.  TRAVIS: I don't know who that is.  LAURA: We wanted to pay tribute to him  and we haven't come up with something."
h6AkvAj_hao,8606239,8609422,"MARISHA: I mean, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Bell."
h6AkvAj_hao,8612119,8617789,"TALIESIN: I almost like you better,  if that makes you feel better.  TRAVIS: Almost?  TALIESIN: It depends on the day."
h6AkvAj_hao,8617789,8623419,"TRAVIS: If I spend more money, will it help matters?  TALIESIN: Oh yeah! TRAVIS: Okay.  SAM: How much money do you got?  TRAVIS: Well, not that much!"
h6AkvAj_hao,8623419,8628640,"TALIESIN: Then no.  TRAVIS: I mean, I don't have my own fancy uniform,  just ready to go for a ball!"
h6AkvAj_hao,8628640,8635269,"ROBBIE: Ah, I'm sorry.  I do like what you picked out, though.  TRAVIS: Thank you.  It's very minimalist."
h6AkvAj_hao,8635269,8640480,I may go without a hat.  I don't know.  ASHLEY: Whoa.  TRAVIS: I know.
h6AkvAj_hao,8640480,8647329,TALIESIN: You should wear something  to just bring the whole thing together.  TRAVIS: I don't put anything on this mane of love.
h6AkvAj_hao,8647329,8653502,TALIESIN: Not even wood?  You're not even going to make something out of wood?  Wear your ware? TRAVIS: Oh shit.  Now I have temptation. ASHLEY: Wear your wares.
h6AkvAj_hao,8654849,8660109,"TALIESIN: Sleep with that.  TRAVIS: But just something to think about.  I mean, you're working for some pretty big people."
h6AkvAj_hao,8660109,8665699,Notoriety seems like it would serve you pretty well.  TALIESIN: I've met more old people with this group  than I think I have in the last 10 years.
h6AkvAj_hao,8665699,8671170,That is an interesting thing.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,8673449,8679544,"MARISHA: What would Bell say if he was here?  LIAM: What do you think, Chetney?"
h6AkvAj_hao,8679544,8684852,TRAVIS: Huh?  MARISHA: You're old.
h6AkvAj_hao,8684852,8691515,"Old people think alike, right?  LIAM: Right. TRAVIS: Yeah.  Fiber is important."
h6AkvAj_hao,8691515,8696704,"TALIESIN: He does sound like him.  TRAVIS: You'll miss your knees when they're gone.  ROBBIE: That's a good saying, yes."
h6AkvAj_hao,8696705,8702008,"LAURA: Bell wanted us to be the Sorcerous Swords.  Bell's Sorcerous Swords, but--"
h6AkvAj_hao,8702008,8708198,"MARISHA: It's too, too much.  TRAVIS: Boy, I really like the sound of that.  It's got nice alliteration. LAURA: I don't--  LIAM: You want something succinct."
h6AkvAj_hao,8708199,8715309,"LAURA: Yeah.  TRAVIS: Yeah.  Hell, I don't know. SAM: The Lumas twins.  LAURA: Something like that, Bell's Lumas Twins."
h6AkvAj_hao,8715309,8721009,Yeah.  TALIESIN: Twin Bells.  That sounds like a pub.  Fuck.
h6AkvAj_hao,8723909,8727187,MARISHA: Maybe it'll come to us in the next three days.  I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,8729998,8735259,"LIAM: Boy, it's almost as if this is a--  LAURA: Hell, I don't know.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,8735259,8741210,"TALIESIN: Next time someone asks,  just say the first thing that--  Whoever says something first.  SAM: We'll do that.  TALIESIN: Fuck it. SAM: We'll do that."
h6AkvAj_hao,8741210,8746642,"ROBBIE: Free association, is that what you're suggesting?  TALIESIN: Somebody's going to say something  next time someone asks and it's going to happen.  ROBBIE: Oh, oh, okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,8746642,8751827,LIAM: It's almost like this is a real problem we're having.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,8751828,8756828,SAM: Why don't y'all go to investigate your papers
h6AkvAj_hao,8757079,8762286,and we'll do some thinking over the next couple of days  and it'll just come to us.
h6AkvAj_hao,8762286,8767555,"LAURA: Yeah. ROBBIE: Like a focus group.  MARISHA: I tried the focus group,  but that didn't work either."
h6AkvAj_hao,8767555,8773249,"I asked everyone.  No one cared.  SAM: Yeah, they said you asked people and they were like,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8773249,8778287,"trouble and-- MARISHA: Yes.  LAURA: And sweet?  TALIESIN: Oh, I thought you were suggesting  The Focus Group is the name for the group."
h6AkvAj_hao,8778287,8784950,LAURA: Sweet Trouble. ROBBIE: Not bad.  TALIESIN: Yeah.  SAM: The Focus Group!  MATT: We are the Focus Group!
h6AkvAj_hao,8784950,8790443,SAM: Because we can't focus!  ASHLEY: Focus!  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,8790443,8796843,"TRAVIS: The FG!  (laughter)  MARISHA: It's got a comma in it  and it's just ""Focus, Group."""
h6AkvAj_hao,8796843,8800962,"ROBBIE: Focus, Group.  TALIESIN: Oh, fuck us."
h6AkvAj_hao,8801909,8806994,"TRAVIS: Yeah. ROBBIE: We'll figure it out.  TALIESIN: It's the Fuck Us Group. MATT: ♪ Bring the focus ♪  ♪ Bring the mother, bring ♪ the motherfucking focus ♪"

h6AkvAj_hao,8812669,8818834,ROBBIE: Do we need anything at--  Your what? TALIESIN: My mask.  MARISHA: What do you mean? LAURA: Your mask for what?  ASHLEY: Are you going incognito?
h6AkvAj_hao,8820689,8826448,"TALIESIN: Did no one else read the fucking--  LAURA: What are you talking about?  LIAM: Well, we bought clothes.  TRAVIS: Oh, wait a minute."
h6AkvAj_hao,8826449,8833819,Do we need masks for the party?  MARISHA: Oh shit.  LIAM: We just finished shopping for seven hours.
h6AkvAj_hao,8833819,8839819,"MARISHA: An all-day event.  Maybe Eshteross can help us.  TALIESIN: You don't buy a mask, you make it."
h6AkvAj_hao,8839819,8845462,"Otherwise, it isn't yours.  ASHLEY: Maybe-- LAURA: Really?  TALIESIN: That's how you imbue it with its power.  No, I don't know. I just like fucking making it.  I just want to make some shit."
h6AkvAj_hao,8845462,8850755,"LAURA: We should've ask--  ASHLEY: Should we have a craft day?  MARISHA: Oh, we should have a craft day.  LAURA: Well, we got a few days.  ASHLEY: Okay, we can make our masks."
h6AkvAj_hao,8850755,8857083,"SAM: Let's go shopping for supplies.  TALIESIN: I've got tons of shit at my house.  LAURA: Let's go. SAM: Okay, great.  MATT: As you arrive at the-- No."
h6AkvAj_hao,8857083,8863439,"TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just make this shit at my house.  We've got hot glue,  we got whatever the fuck you need. Magic.  MATT: Hot glue's level two, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,8863439,8868704,It's a level two spell slot.  ASHLEY: Hot glue has such is good smell.  TRAVIS: It does.
h6AkvAj_hao,8868704,8876033,"TALIESIN: You are not wrong.  SAM: Come on, focus, group.  ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,8876033,8881696,ROBBIE: Oh no! (laughter)  ROBBIE: Oh no!  ASHLEY: That's a pretty great--
h6AkvAj_hao,8881697,8885949,TALIESIN: We're not fine. (laughter)  TALIESIN: We're done.  ASHLEY: The Focus comma Group?
h6AkvAj_hao,8888419,8893829,MATT: Okay. TALIESIN: This is now  going to be a joke forever.  (laughter)  MATT: All right.
h6AkvAj_hao,8893829,8900240,So you are first looking towards  the Maahan House of Lumas.  LIAM: Right. We are making our way to House Lumas.
h6AkvAj_hao,8900240,8904819,"ALL: ♪ Makin' our way! ♪ SAM: ♪ Focus Group ♪  MATT: Is just you, or--?  LIAM: Just the two of us.  MATT: The two of you, okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,8905909,8911644,"In the early afternoon,  traveling back to Lucent Spire--  that's a silver each."
h6AkvAj_hao,8912525,8918469,"LIAM: I'm getting used to this a little more gradually.  LAURA: These fucking--  LIAM: Yeah, 5% better."
h6AkvAj_hao,8918469,8923639,This is like the 15th time  I've watched you ride one of these.  LAURA: I'd been on these for quite a while  before you guys came to town.
h6AkvAj_hao,8923639,8930879,"LIAM: Oh, it's never going to change, then.  LAURA: Look out the window.  We are high.  LIAM: Yep.  LAURA: These things could snap at any moment."
h6AkvAj_hao,8930879,8936344,"LIAM: That's probably not going to happen. MATT: It begins to shake  slightly left to right.  LAURA: You see what I'm fucking talking about?  MATT: You think it's the wind,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8936344,8942640,but you look to the back of the cart  and there is a little 12-year-old boy  in really good dress with a giant lollipop just going--
h6AkvAj_hao,8942640,8947867,"(laughter)  LAURA: In his head, he hears:"
h6AkvAj_hao,8947867,8952792,I can find you in your dreams.  MATT: He drops his lollipop.
h6AkvAj_hao,8954019,8959749,"LAURA: Shit, now I feel guilty.  Laudna does that shit all the time and it just--"
h6AkvAj_hao,8959749,8965938,"I'm kidding, kid, I'm not going to--  I didn't--  Shit.  You're fine."
h6AkvAj_hao,8965939,8971739,You're going to dream of-- shit.  MATT: It comes to land at the Lucent Spire.
h6AkvAj_hao,8971739,8977146,"LIAM: As we walk out and she looks the other way,  I look up at the kid and say, ""She'll haunt you forever,""  and I walk off. (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,8977147,8983634,"ROBBIE: Jesus!  This campaign hates children.  MATT: You walk for about 30, 40 seconds before you hear,"
h6AkvAj_hao,8983634,8990158,"(crying) LAURA: Oh no!  MATT: The kid just goes running.  You hear, (posh voice) ""What's wrong, Daniel?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,8990158,8996069,"As you continue moving forward.  (laughter)  ASHLEY: ""But what's wrong, Daniel?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,8996069,9002609,MATT: You follow the familiar path to the exterior  of the Lumas House.
h6AkvAj_hao,9002609,9007859,"The guards are still placed, keeping watch  in the main central garden area"
h6AkvAj_hao,9007859,9013999,"that leads into the courtyard before the house itself.  LIAM: Okay.  Before we get any closer than we are now, I have an idea."
h6AkvAj_hao,9013999,9022302,"LAURA: Okay.  LIAM: I think in this one instance,  it'd be cool if we just were real about what we want."
h6AkvAj_hao,9023769,9029510,"LAURA: Oh. LIAM: You know what I mean?  Just you're a scholar, they were scholars.  It's a coincidence."
h6AkvAj_hao,9030759,9035999,"They were the last people to check out that book  you believe, and you know, we left things on a good note."
h6AkvAj_hao,9035999,9041482,"So I think, just in this instance,  maybe honesty is the way to go.  Keep it simple."
h6AkvAj_hao,9041483,9045031,LAURA: All right.  All right.
h6AkvAj_hao,9046509,9054099,"LIAM: It's just because they were kind to us  and I don't feel like--  LAURA: Fully, and I mean, we are asking to rummage  through... their rooms."
h6AkvAj_hao,9054099,9061469,"LIAM: Right. LAURA: Potentially.  LIAM: And so much goes south if  we're breaking into their house, so."
h6AkvAj_hao,9061469,9066584,"LAURA: Yes. LIAM: Maybe it works,  maybe it doesn't, but I have good feeling.  LAURA: Okay.  LIAM: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,9068439,9075007,Excuse me?  MATT: As you walk up to the guard  and they take a somewhat defensive stance
h6AkvAj_hao,9075007,9081054,"and you say, ""Excuse me?"", a voice to your left goes,  ""Oh, welcome back."""
h6AkvAj_hao,9081054,9089129,"You glance over, and hidden just beyond the hedge  that you didn't see sitting on a small  dark marble bench is Ela Lumas,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9089129,9094762,"the matriarch of the household,  who's currently sitting with a small metallic tray"
h6AkvAj_hao,9094762,9102349,"with tea and small cups on there,  and is in the process of thumbing through a small--"
h6AkvAj_hao,9102349,9109059,"it looks like a pocket book before closing it  and turning it over to you wearing a different,  but still white dress."
h6AkvAj_hao,9109989,9115396,"LIAM: Oh, good morning.  It's fortuitous that you're out here."
h6AkvAj_hao,9116689,9123028,"Am I catching you at a good moment today?  MATT: ""This time is fine as any.  ""What do you need?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,9123029,9129611,"LAURA: So sorry to bother you again, ma'am.  It's such an odd coincidence."
h6AkvAj_hao,9130979,9137412,I'm on a bit of a scholarly hunt.  I was working at the Starlight Conservatory.
h6AkvAj_hao,9138569,9146473,One of the books that I was researching  had a couple pages missing from it.
h6AkvAj_hao,9149507,9157892,"When I asked them who the last person  that had seen the book was, they said it was the twins."
h6AkvAj_hao,9159369,9163661,"It just seemed like too odd of a coincidence,  like fate had pulled us here."
h6AkvAj_hao,9165139,9171542,"So, we thought--  LIAM: We thought, if it's not overstepping,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9172979,9180712,"we were wondering if you had any of their things left?  We obviously don't want to take, but we're wondering,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9181879,9188668,"under your discretion, of course,  if there's any of their studies or notes left,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9188668,9195918,if we could possibly with you take a look?  if we could possibly with you take a look?
h6AkvAj_hao,9196839,9201839,"MATT: ""Well, the Duskmaven works in mysterious ways, I suppose."
h6AkvAj_hao,9202099,9207099,"""You are welcome to look, if you'd like."""
h6AkvAj_hao,9207149,9213469,LAURA: Thank you so much.  MATT: You would acknowledge this  just because you've heard it from people who live nearby.
h6AkvAj_hao,9213469,9219339,"The Duskmaven is Marquetian.  In many places, the Marquetian interpretation  of the Matron of Ravens."
h6AkvAj_hao,9219339,9224818,"TRAVIS: Dusk or dust?  MATT: Duskmaven.  Yeah.  Different cultures have different interpretations of,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9224818,9230114,"you know?  While the deities largely are consistent,  there are different"
h6AkvAj_hao,9230114,9235052,interpretive designs and ideas of it  based on culture and landscape and history.
h6AkvAj_hao,9236389,9242559,"""But yes, you are welcome to look about.  ""If you would like to escort just for comfort,"

h6AkvAj_hao,9249269,9255169,"where you originally saw that observatory tower,  and leads you into a chamber that, you know,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9255169,9260779,there is a bit pause as she opens it  and takes a deep breath  before crossing the threshold
h6AkvAj_hao,9260779,9267328,"and then staying there,  before she turns to both of you and says,  ""For what you need."""
h6AkvAj_hao,9267329,9274577,LIAM: That's extremely generous of you.  We're very appreciative. Thank you.  LAURA: We'll try not to take up too much of your time.
h6AkvAj_hao,9275769,9284299,"MATT: As you enter, you can see this is equal parts  just a massive dormitory slash laboratory, if you will."
h6AkvAj_hao,9284299,9290199,"You can see there were two different beds set up,  arranged different parts of the room.  There are two different floor levels,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9290199,9298242,"one about five or six feet above the other  with stairs that wind around to the upper portion.  You can see there is a large device,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9299349,9304599,a telescope-type brass contraption  that descends from the tower itself
h6AkvAj_hao,9304599,9312538,"and leads to an upper platform.  It's a bit raised up, and you can see  all sort of manner of cranks  and odd portions of the device that are used to shift"
h6AkvAj_hao,9312539,9316347,and alter it to whatever the viewer would prefer.
h6AkvAj_hao,9319459,9326559,"You can see there are tables for note taking,  desk space and everything, but it's mostly"
h6AkvAj_hao,9326559,9330823,"all locked away and kept clean, kept spick-and-span."
h6AkvAj_hao,9332186,9339134,"LAURA: Do you know where their  most recent notes would've been?  MATT: ""Unfortunately, I do not.  ""I apologize."

h6AkvAj_hao,9353039,9358629,"MATT: ""I think so, for a time, not too long, I hope.""  LAURA: Of course not.  LIAM: Are we looking for pages, yeah?"
h6AkvAj_hao,9358629,9365969,"LAURA: Yeah, torn edges, anything you see  about celestial bodies and dreams, visions."
h6AkvAj_hao,9366539,9372699,LIAM: Torn pages is a good start.  LAURA: Yeah.  MATT: Okay.  Both of you make investigation checks
h6AkvAj_hao,9372699,9375723,"or one of you with advantage, your choice."
h6AkvAj_hao,9379139,9384358,"LIAM: Take advantage.  LAURA: Okay.  LIAM: I hold up boxes and drawers for her,  show her things."
h6AkvAj_hao,9384359,9388254,"MATT: Right, but let her guide the actual investigation.  TRAVIS: Let's go, L.B. Come on now."

h6AkvAj_hao,9394673,9400509,MATT: You spend the better part of an hour--  LIAM: You take 14 and a half.  (laughter)  MATT: You spend the better part of an hour
h6AkvAj_hao,9400509,9406639,"poring through what's available,  looking at through whatever loose notes  can be found underneath,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9406639,9415679,"small books, looking through books, looking through--  gathering pieces of sheet paper and scrawlings on them."
h6AkvAj_hao,9416199,9425519,"Looking across the shelves,  they have various other tomes  that speak about astronomy, that speak about the planes,  that speak about all the various interesting"
h6AkvAj_hao,9425519,9430990,"and fascinating celestial acknowledgements and theories  across the history of Exandria,"

h6AkvAj_hao,9451929,9457035,"LAURA: This is such an awful question.  In your head, you hear,"

h6AkvAj_hao,9471804,9473804,that'll be all right.

h6AkvAj_hao,9582670,9591499,Is there anything else we can do for you  to repay the kindness you've shown us here today?  MATT: She reaches down and pulls open the breast fold
h6AkvAj_hao,9591499,9597715,"of her robe that she's wearing,  and pulls out a small pin"
h6AkvAj_hao,9597715,9600981,that you can see was being held in there  and looks at it for a second.

h6AkvAj_hao,9786709,9794818,SAM: Yeah. LAURA: Is it special?  Is something weird about it?  MATT: You don't know.  It definitely has the scent and air of--

h6AkvAj_hao,9802129,9808119,of magical implements for sale.  This definitely has the air of being a little more  of a rural bake.

h6AkvAj_hao,9857324,9863657,"MATT: Anywhere from 50 to 75 gold.  LIAM: Sounds like Mr. Pibbs.  TALIESIN: It just dares you to drink  something more noxious. TRAVIS: Thank you, Identify."
h6AkvAj_hao,9863657,9869916,"That's very handy, F.C.G.  SAM: You're welcome, anytime.  TALIESIN: Once a day. ASHLEY: I mean, I told you  that it was a healing potion, so."
h6AkvAj_hao,9869916,9876136,"LAURA: You did.  SAM: You did!  ASHLEY: Just by smelling it. TRAVIS: You suggested I start  working with clay.  LAURA: You know, we should find out what that little--"
h6AkvAj_hao,9876136,9880120,"Oh, never mind. We didn't see you take it.  SAM: And she gave it back."
h6AkvAj_hao,9882210,9887329,"Speaking of clay.  ASHLEY: I'll steal it again later.  SAM: I don't know how it works,  but I'm going to--"
h6AkvAj_hao,9887329,9893635,Do I know what a ziggurat is?  I need a clay model of a ziggurat  and I've got some clay.
h6AkvAj_hao,9893635,9899333,MATT: You have some hardened clay. Yeah.  LAURA: It's hardened clay.  SAM: Can't you melt it down? I don't know how clay works.
h6AkvAj_hao,9899333,9905840,"MATT: That's not-- That's not how--  MARISHA: No. ROBBIE: No, no, no.  SAM: Oh shit. MATT: But you can,  you can buy some clay  and attempt to utilize your skills to"
h6AkvAj_hao,9905840,9911684,"craft a ziggurat.  SAM: It's just like Play-Doh.  LAURA: Eight gold. LIAM: A little hard statue.  LAURA: How much did you spend on it?  MARISHA: You can't do that with Play-Doh, either."
h6AkvAj_hao,9911684,9918479,"Once it's dry, it's definitely dry for forever.  TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no remoistening.  ROBBIE: Just eat it. MATT: It's very sad."
h6AkvAj_hao,9918480,9923520,"TALIESIN: Yeah, I was about to say.  It's never quite the same.  LAURA: Oh, look at this buddy. He is so pooping."
h6AkvAj_hao,9923520,9929606,"LIAM: He's so sad. MATT: I know.  SAM: Try and find some clay.  MATT: Easy enough to find in a number of  general stores, who honestly,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9929606,9934582,"probably gather it from a couple of the  more damp sections of some of the alleyways,"
h6AkvAj_hao,9935769,9942671,"but you can attempt to sculpt your own ziggurat,  if you'd like. SAM: I will try.  MATT: Okay. If you could roll either  a dexterity or intelligence check"
h6AkvAj_hao,9942671,9949471,"for me, please.  SAM: Oh boy. Okay.  MARISHA: What are you doing?  SAM: I'm going to do dexterity plus zero."
h6AkvAj_hao,9949471,9954928,Guidance!  It's a five.  (laughter)  ROBBIE: Oh boy.
h6AkvAj_hao,9956356,9962119,MATT: It will function for any sort of spell usage you need  that requires a ziggurat
h6AkvAj_hao,9962119,9968279,of a clay sculpture.  But it definitely looks a lot more phallic
h6AkvAj_hao,9968279,9973398,than you intended.  (laughter)  ASHLEY: What is that? LAURA: Hey.
h6AkvAj_hao,9973399,9980056,"SAM: It's a ziggurat!  TALIESIN: Oh. ROBBIE: Mm.  ASHLEY: That's not what I would call it, but that works."
h6AkvAj_hao,9980056,9985777,"SAM: I-- Well, I-- (stammers)  How do I explain this?"
h6AkvAj_hao,9987036,9992055,LIAM: We're all adults here. TRAVIS: How are you holding that?  TALIESIN: No judgment. ROBBIE: Yeah.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,9992055,10000722,"TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I see it now.  MARISHA: It's balanced to the left.  SAM: It will help me focus my magic to cast a spell."
h6AkvAj_hao,10001557,10010149,MATT: A symbol of The Focus Group.  (laughter)  LAURA: How did both campaigns end up with a dick as their symbol?
h6AkvAj_hao,10010149,10015177,MATT: Because we're responsible adults.  We are mature human beings.
h6AkvAj_hao,10016058,10022479,MARISHA: Why a (slowly) ziggurat?  Ziggurat?  SAM: Because--
h6AkvAj_hao,10022480,10027409,I don't know. I just had this feeling deep inside of me.  Maybe it was something that was sort of--
h6AkvAj_hao,10029189,10034516,"Maybe Dancer sort of--  MARISHA: Programmed it in you?  SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10034516,10041065,I don't know. I get a sense--  I get a sense that I need it.  (laughter)  SAM: I got a sense that I need it.
h6AkvAj_hao,10041066,10047259,"TRAVIS: Can you remind me what  your associates' names were? LAURA: Mm!  TRAVIS: What? LAURA: Oh.  Never mind, continue."
h6AkvAj_hao,10047259,10052839,"TRAVIS: Oh, did you attack me or something?  LAURA: No, I just need your help,  but you can keep talking to him.  TRAVIS: Oh."
h6AkvAj_hao,10052839,10059029,"SAM: You mean the people who I travel with?  TRAVIS: Well, yeah, you keyed in on the associates.  ASHLEY: Designated driver? SAM: Yeah... Dancer!"
h6AkvAj_hao,10059029,10066111,ASHLEY: What are they called? SAM: Dancer was my maker.  She's great.  We also rolled with Terrawyn.
h6AkvAj_hao,10068389,10074584,They were really cool with earth magic and stuff.  Ozene was a--
h6AkvAj_hao,10076229,10083589,"She was an awesome hi-yah type fighter,  and also really great with water and stuff."
h6AkvAj_hao,10083589,10088722,"Then Axer was--  LAURA: Used an axe.  SAM: He used an axe, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10088722,10094105,"He's a big, big surly type.  Had flies buzzing around his head.  LAURA: Oh wow. TRAVIS: Awesome."
h6AkvAj_hao,10095618,10102019,"Cool.  SAM: They're all gone now, though.  LAURA: I'm sorry."
h6AkvAj_hao,10102019,10109259,"SAM: It's all right.  Earlier, Orym, you asked me  what I wanted and I would very much like to find"
h6AkvAj_hao,10109259,10115569,"some sort of justice for them  and I didn't tell you before, but I think I remember"
h6AkvAj_hao,10115569,10124870,"seeing the thing that did it to them.  I don't remember much because I was coming out of a stasis,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10124871,10129926,but I did see that the creature had one eye.  LAURA: One eye.
h6AkvAj_hao,10129926,10135473,SAM: So I've been trying to find--  LAURA: A one-eyed-- TALIESIN: On the side  or in the center?
h6AkvAj_hao,10136338,10144619,"SAM: Oh, I mean--  TALIESIN: Is that just too much?  SAM: It's just a blur. LAURA: You know what?  I wonder if we can do a thing."
h6AkvAj_hao,10144619,10150809,SAM: What's that? TALIESIN: Yeah?  LAURA: I'm going to cast Detect Thoughts.  TRAVIS: Oh shit. LAURA: On F.C.G.
h6AkvAj_hao,10150809,10156022,"SAM: Okay.  LAURA: All right. SAM: Okay.  LAURA: Just open yourself up to it, all right?  Don't try to fight me on this."
h6AkvAj_hao,10156022,10161688,"SAM: I won't.  LAURA: All right, I'm going to put my hands, both hands,  on the side of his face.  SAM: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10161689,10167929,"LAURA: I want you to think--  If this is too traumatizing for you,  if this is too hard, you don't have to do it.  SAM: No, it's fine."
h6AkvAj_hao,10167929,10173076,LAURA: Think about the moment.  SAM: Okay.
h6AkvAj_hao,10173077,10179569,"I was-- Well, it was early morning  when I woke up or was roused, I suppose,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10179569,10183752,because I don't think my stasis was over yet.
h6AkvAj_hao,10185649,10191504,I sort of came to and I saw a lot of blood.  And--
h6AkvAj_hao,10192849,10194932,some of my friends fallen.
h6AkvAj_hao,10198929,10205021,I saw Dancer.  Her last few breaths.
h6AkvAj_hao,10207179,10211068,She sort of looked at the creature that was...
h6AkvAj_hao,10213149,10219068,"upon her, I guess?  Then it turned at me suddenly."
h6AkvAj_hao,10219069,10226132,"I just remember being so scared,  and it looked at me with that one eye,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10227089,10232097,"and then it was just gone.  LAURA: While he's telling this whole story,  I'm going to try to dive"
h6AkvAj_hao,10232097,10237899,deeper and deeper into his brain  and see if I can pick up any visual cues to maybe
h6AkvAj_hao,10237899,10244521,see it more clearly than what he can remember.  MATT: Okay.  Focusing on the vision that's present.
h6AkvAj_hao,10246479,10251589,The words that are spoken are clearer  than the image you get.
h6AkvAj_hao,10251589,10252769,There is...
h6AkvAj_hao,10256959,10262180,"I want to say a boundary of emotion,  but there is definitely..."
h6AkvAj_hao,10265369,10270369,A type of trauma or scar within this
h6AkvAj_hao,10271139,10275988,"somewhat humanoid, but also alien mind that"
h6AkvAj_hao,10276829,10282359,"while he is able to acknowledge  these experiences verbally,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10284359,10289479,it's like...  It's like the memory's not letting you in.
h6AkvAj_hao,10289479,10295868,LAURA: Does it feel different than  other people that I try to
h6AkvAj_hao,10295869,10301622,Detect Thoughts on?  MATT: Only in the sense that  F.C.G. is not a typical human.
h6AkvAj_hao,10302759,10308209,"The blockade isn't like a second force  trying to push you out, but anybody who"
h6AkvAj_hao,10308209,10317388,"has undergone some sort of a trauma that  they're not quite ready to face,  there is an instinctual protective resistance to it."
h6AkvAj_hao,10317388,10320227,It's more akin to that.  LAURA: Okay.
h6AkvAj_hao,10325491,10330559,Yeah. SAM: Did you get anything?  LAURA: No.  Mostly just what you were saying.
h6AkvAj_hao,10332459,10338919,"SAM: Did you see-- You didn't see the creature?  LAURA: Did I see the creature?  MATT: Weirdly, no."
h6AkvAj_hao,10338919,10344969,"It was just flashes of like,  like spikes of memory.  You remember a campfire."
h6AkvAj_hao,10344969,10350438,You remember elements of jungle.  You remember sudden movement. You remember screams.
h6AkvAj_hao,10350439,10357279,"You remember the sense of fear,  the shaking, the helplessness"
h6AkvAj_hao,10357279,10362219,within Fresh Cut Grass.  Then the aftermath.
h6AkvAj_hao,10363069,10368738,"Like somebody who woke from a dream,  but was too groggy to stop something"
h6AkvAj_hao,10368739,10370772,that was already in motion.
h6AkvAj_hao,10374229,10380818,LAURA: I didn't see it.  I've never tried to--
h6AkvAj_hao,10380819,10386599,"Do something quite like that before, but--  I'm sorry I put you through it."
h6AkvAj_hao,10386599,10393199,"SAM: No, it's fine.  I do that stuff a lot.  I used to do that stuff all the time."
h6AkvAj_hao,10393199,10399879,"Try to pry into people's minds  and see what's bothering them.  And you do sort of the same thing,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10399879,10403457,sometimes. LAURA: I do the same thing  but normally it's trying to find
h6AkvAj_hao,10404959,10407814,"thoughts, less about trying to find"
h6AkvAj_hao,10410299,10417634,"visions, if that makes sense.  I just got flashes of what you went through."
h6AkvAj_hao,10421629,10425639,"SAM: Well, thank you for trying.  If you ever want me to do that to you--"
h6AkvAj_hao,10427109,10432919,I wouldn't mind returning the favor.  LAURA: Thank you so much. I'll let you know.  (laughs)  Don't you do it right now.
h6AkvAj_hao,10432919,10439194,"SAM: No, of course not. LAURA: All right.  You're welcome in my head  anytime you want.  SAM: If you want me to."
h6AkvAj_hao,10441799,10446839,LAURA: All right.  MATT: Sam. SAM: Huh?
h6AkvAj_hao,10446839,10451958,MATT: You take two points.  LAURA: (gasps)  What did I do?  MATT: You didn't do anything.
h6AkvAj_hao,10454816,10459260,TRAVIS: (alarm noises)  (laughter)  LAURA: Oh no!
h6AkvAj_hao,10461695,10468036,MATT: All righty.  SAM: Just roll a couple death saves.  (laughter)  SAM: I'm unconscious-- no.
h6AkvAj_hao,10468036,10473950,"(laughter)  MATT: You're fine, you're fine.  LAURA: Okay.  MATT: All right, so--  TALIESIN: Don't traumatize them."
h6AkvAj_hao,10473950,10479875,"TRAVIS: Are you going to go  check out the other library?  LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10479875,10486839,"TRAVIS: Stuff?  LAURA: Yes.  MATT: What else would you like--  So you're going to do further research?  LAURA: I was going to do more research if I could, but--"
h6AkvAj_hao,10486839,10492310,MATT: What specifically are you looking into?  LAURA: I am looking into--  What do you want me to look into?
h6AkvAj_hao,10492310,10498669,"MARISHA: Well, you know, only after you've done sufficient  research on whatever you're looking for for yourself."
h6AkvAj_hao,10498669,10502526,"But, you know, if you just happen to stumble  upon anything about"
h6AkvAj_hao,10504429,10509528,"The Briarwoods,  what they were up to,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10509529,10516139,"having a dead woman in your head  a year after she dies,  how to get rid of said dead woman in your head,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10516139,10522003,"if I get rid of said dead woman,  am I going to lose all my powers?  All those things. LAURA: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,10522003,10529659,"MARISHA: That could be good.  LAURA: So the stuff we talked about.  MARISHA: Yeah, you know.  LAURA: F.C.G., do you want to try to come in with me?"
h6AkvAj_hao,10529659,10533532,"I could say you're my assistant.  SAM: If you'll have me, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10534729,10540699,"You were going to look up something for me, right?  LAURA: Yeah.  SAM: Yeah, sure, I'll come with you. Yes. Absolutely."
h6AkvAj_hao,10540699,10546149,"In fact, let me give you some...  If you're going to lie and say that I'm your assistant,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10546149,10553119,"let me give you some Guidance.  LAURA: Oh, thank you.  SAM: Yeah.  LAURA: All right.  MATT: Okay, so what are you looking into right now?"
h6AkvAj_hao,10553119,10559679,"LAURA: Okay, I want to look into--  Number one, I want to find out if it's possible  to find out what other books the Lumas twins"
h6AkvAj_hao,10559679,10566759,"had checked out  when they were there.  MATT: Okay. SAM: Actually, you know what?  I'm going to go ahead and give you Enhance Ability"
h6AkvAj_hao,10566759,10572059,"on all intelligence checks.  Is that something I can do?  Would that help your research, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,10572989,10578929,"LAURA: Is that investigation? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's investigation. That's good.  SAM: Fox's Cunning. All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,10578929,10585379,"MATT: So you go and head to the library.  Your previous scribe is not  currently working.  But the individual that you are assigned,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10585379,10590992,named Yome  is a more gruff figure.
h6AkvAj_hao,10592299,10597519,You go ahead and ask them for access.  Roll a persuasion check with disadvantage.
h6AkvAj_hao,10597519,10601473,SAM: You do have Guidance.  LAURA: I do have Guidance still.
h6AkvAj_hao,10608446,10613639,"Then Guidance, I add a four.  MATT: Add a d4, yeah.  LAURA: 14."
h6AkvAj_hao,10613639,10620418,"MATT: 14.  ""I'm sorry.  ""That information is specific to administration."""
h6AkvAj_hao,10621349,10624934,LAURA: Right.  Thank you.
h6AkvAj_hao,10626539,10630544,"I'm just going to look for more books, then.  MATT: What else are you looking at?"
h6AkvAj_hao,10631636,10637779,LAURA: Are you with me?  Was I able to get F.C.G. in with me?  MATT: I will say having an automaton assistant
h6AkvAj_hao,10637779,10644111,"is not entirely out of the realm of expectations.  So, yes, you were able to accompany.  TRAVIS: It's like having a laptop in the early 2000's."
h6AkvAj_hao,10644112,10649152,"MATT: Kind of, yeah.  People are like, ""Wow, I mean, sure.  ""Where do you get one?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,10649152,10654472,LAURA: Maybe together we can look for-- I want to find out  information about the Briarwoods in Whitestone.
h6AkvAj_hao,10656009,10661903,Any information I can find out about them.  MATT: Roll an investigation check.  LAURA: With advantage? MATT: With advantage  because of the spell.
h6AkvAj_hao,10662919,10668626,"LAURA: Come on, you piece of--  TRAVIS: Probably just need more dice."
h6AkvAj_hao,10668626,10677069,"LAURA: Eight.  MATT: Eight? LAURA: I'm sorry, Laudna!  LIAM: Got to cross the threshold.  MARISHA: It's all right. MATT: You find  historical records, which are available."
h6AkvAj_hao,10677069,10684908,They speak of Sylas and Delilah Briarwood.  Two nobles within the realm of Wildemount that were...
h6AkvAj_hao,10687179,10693219,"Some accounts say exiled, others say that  they were hunted beyond its borders.  LAURA: Angry, yeah, I just stabbed my--"
h6AkvAj_hao,10693219,10699698,"MATT: I can tell.  But then were known to abscond to Tal'Dorei,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10699699,10704724,"where they raised a bloody incursion  in the city of Whitestone,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10705589,10710340,"wiping out the majority of the de Rolo family,  and then taking over."
h6AkvAj_hao,10711219,10716949,"There, they held, in secret,  power in court over the township  for the period of about five years,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10717789,10723235,before they were ousted and thought to be destroyed  by the heroes known as Vox Machina.
h6AkvAj_hao,10724429,10730749,"SAM: Are there pictures of them in the book,  and are they sexy?  MATT: No, there are not pictures"
h6AkvAj_hao,10730749,10738533,"because you rolled too low to find the sexy photos.  A 15, at least, to find the sexy photos. I'm just saying."
h6AkvAj_hao,10738533,10745309,(laughter)  MATT: Yes. (laughter)  TALIESIN: Legends of Vox Machina Swimsuit issue?  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,10745309,10750438,"LIAM: There is a note scribbled on the side:  Pretty sexy.  MATT: Hey, the Ghost Rider spread in that swimsuit issue"
h6AkvAj_hao,10750439,10757249,"was awesome. TALIESIN: Yeah, that's very fair.  MARISHA: Is this holographic?  (laughter)  TALIESIN: In the dollar bin. LIAM: Well, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,10757249,10763148,Look at that cube. LAURA: Okay.  MATT: But yeah. You find  footnotes that apparently speak of
h6AkvAj_hao,10763149,10769579,"involvement, like post mortem involvement  during the incursion of the Whispered One."
h6AkvAj_hao,10769579,10774894,"Also involving Vox Machina,  but there has been no recorded account of that."
h6AkvAj_hao,10774894,10780350,"And that's it.  LAURA: Okay.  Oh god, also information about"
h6AkvAj_hao,10781909,10787429,"suddenly getting power. This is so similar  to what I was researching before, but getting power,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10787429,10793559,being related to  an external magic source.
h6AkvAj_hao,10793559,10798858,"MATT: Go ahead and roll an investigation check.  MARISHA: Come on, girl. ASHLEY: Come on, baby.  SAM: I will also look with her."
h6AkvAj_hao,10798859,10805516,"LAURA: Oh, yeah, that's good.  MATT: Okay, yeah, because yeah, she has advantage--  LAURA: Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's good!"
h6AkvAj_hao,10805516,10810372,"Did you Guide me? You didn't Guide me.  SAM: I did not. LAURA: 20.  MATT: 20, good, good."
h6AkvAj_hao,10811419,10817479,You find a plethora  of books and tomes and historical accounts
h6AkvAj_hao,10817479,10823619,speaking on people who spontaneously  began to develop magical powers.  There are some that speak of blood magic
h6AkvAj_hao,10823619,10829749,"and lineages that carry contact with magical beings,  whether it be fey, dragons, and other"
h6AkvAj_hao,10829749,10835039,"djinn and elementals that in the past history,  there was, whether a magical imbuement"
h6AkvAj_hao,10835039,10841499,"or an actual crossing of bloodlines, in which case  people who were born in later generations"
h6AkvAj_hao,10841499,10848759,began to suddenly evoke powers and abilities.  There are some that speak of individuals  who were experimented upon
h6AkvAj_hao,10848759,10856028,"that were cursed or corrupted  by, whether it be natural situations"
h6AkvAj_hao,10856029,10861939,or dark mages who intended to try and create  and essentially force
h6AkvAj_hao,10863109,10868568,magical beings and those capable of bending  the elements to their will.
h6AkvAj_hao,10869449,10873219,Those speak of failures and eventual...
h6AkvAj_hao,10874669,10881959,"essentially degeneration of these individuals  and were considered both unethical,  illegal, and practices that are"
h6AkvAj_hao,10883579,10888669,essentially hunted down to prevent from happening again.  There are...
h6AkvAj_hao,10889529,10896898,tales of gods gifting champions  and chosen ones who work
h6AkvAj_hao,10896899,10902289,and walk within a path of fate  that marks their interests that will grant boons.
h6AkvAj_hao,10902289,10909759,But those usually come in the classically  and written as a series of visions from the entity.
h6AkvAj_hao,10909759,10912202,There is a divine nature to these gifts.
h6AkvAj_hao,10914849,10923019,"It's overwhelming, the amount of...  historical and theoretical writings"
h6AkvAj_hao,10923019,10929419,that conjecture on the multitudes of sources  of spontaneous power.  LAURA: Anything about severing that tie?
h6AkvAj_hao,10929419,10936133,Do you lose the powers given to you?  MATT: There are some that speak on  the source of patrons.
h6AkvAj_hao,10936133,10941539,"That can pick up entities that are more powerful,  that aren't divine, that can grant it as an exchange."
h6AkvAj_hao,10941539,10947972,"But then those also are contracts that can be breached  and that tie is severed,  but those are usually acknowledged"
h6AkvAj_hao,10947972,10953079,"and at least bought into, to a certain degree,  by the person, so there was a conscious level"
h6AkvAj_hao,10953079,10956839,of understanding of that arrangement.  Yours--
h6AkvAj_hao,10959349,10964711,"It's hard to place.  Based on everything you've read,  it could be bloodline related."
h6AkvAj_hao,10964711,10970398,"A lot of the things that you read,  it tends to draw you in the direction  of there being something in past lineage"
h6AkvAj_hao,10970399,10977259,"that has been sparked at a certain age,  or by a certain  alliance of..."
h6AkvAj_hao,10977259,10983369,"congruent, magical...  alignments in the world."
h6AkvAj_hao,10983369,10989829,"That may have triggered this spontaneous capability.  LAURA: I'm also looking for Laudna,"
h6AkvAj_hao,10989829,10996539,to be able to sever that Delilah connection  if she did that.  Any evidence that if she severed that connection
h6AkvAj_hao,10996539,11005329,"with Delilah, she would lose that.  MATT: Most conversations and write-ups"
h6AkvAj_hao,11005329,11011809,regarding patron-based relationships  where it is a gift granted by a contract
h6AkvAj_hao,11011809,11020499,"with a more powerful entity or being  say that when that contract is broken  outside of some sort of majestic fey,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11020499,11028022,"doublecross, written in print-type gotcha moment.  Those gifts do recede with the arrangement."
h6AkvAj_hao,11029169,11035629,"There are exceptions, but they're rare,  and they usually fall into the realm of folklore  or fairytales that are told through the ages"
h6AkvAj_hao,11035629,11040829,"of a mortal outsmarting an immortal,  and those are rare or honestly, probably fiction"
h6AkvAj_hao,11040829,11047639,in a lot of cases.  LAURA: Okay. MATT: So I'd say--  There are discussions that fall in the realm
h6AkvAj_hao,11047639,11052917,"of interesting conversation topics, but there is no  How to Break Your Relationship with Your Patron"
h6AkvAj_hao,11052917,11058709,"and Keep Your Magic for Dummies.  LAURA: Right, right, right, right.  I have so many other things I want to look up"
h6AkvAj_hao,11058709,11064909,"in regards to Laudna.  But I don't want to waste--  (murmurs) everybody's time, so...  MATT: Well, we'll come back to it."
h6AkvAj_hao,11064909,11069939,"LIAM: Libraries are pretty great.  MARISHA: I love libraries. TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.  MATT: The rest of you,  what else would you like to do?"
h6AkvAj_hao,11069939,11074369,"Look up, have conversations, ask about folks.  Prep, what would you like to do?  LIAM: I got one."
h6AkvAj_hao,11075659,11082859,"One of these nights before the ball,  at night in bed  in the sort of Wonka-esque"
h6AkvAj_hao,11082859,11086669,"pile that Dorian, Orym, and Fearne  sleep in one bed together--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11088486,11094755,"ROBBIE: Throuple-- LIAM: At, like--  ASHLEY: Yes! LIAM: -- one in the morning,  Orym shifts and says:"
h6AkvAj_hao,11095759,11101055,Fearne?  ASHLEY: (groans)  LIAM: Are you awake?  ASHLEY: (groans) LIAM: Wake up.
h6AkvAj_hao,11101055,11106284,"ASHLEY: (groans) LIAM: Dorian.  ROBBIE: I'm in the middle, I can hear you.  LIAM: Okay, good."
h6AkvAj_hao,11106284,11109797,(laughter)  I want to have a--
h6AkvAj_hao,11111452,11117593,"A pow wow, a chat.  Well, no, yeah, I'm good.  Tired, too."
h6AkvAj_hao,11119089,11124225,That Ira character.  He knew your last name.
h6AkvAj_hao,11125362,11131059,"ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I forgot about that.  LIAM: Is that a problem?  ASHLEY: I don't think so."
h6AkvAj_hao,11131059,11136679,"(laughter)  MARISHA: Probably fine.  LIAM: Okay, I'm going to wake up."
h6AkvAj_hao,11136679,11142303,"And he sits up, barely crests his head out  from between the two of them because he's so small."
h6AkvAj_hao,11145379,11150406,LAURA: He rolled over you.  (laughter) TRAVIS: (mumbling)  ROBBIE: (groans)
h6AkvAj_hao,11150407,11156539,"ASHLEY: Do you think it's a problem?  LIAM: Yeah, I mean,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11156539,11163759,I'm leaning towards yeah.  He knew your last name.  Are you well known? Is your family well-known?
h6AkvAj_hao,11163759,11170669,"Over there,  out there, in there? ASHLEY: Well, yes.  We-- We're, I mean, we're--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11173319,11178310,We're basically royalty there.  ROBBIE: Excuse me?
h6AkvAj_hao,11179179,11185052,"I've never done this, insight check?  MATT: Yeah, roll an insight check.  TRAVIS: Do I believe her?  ROBBIE: Yeah, do I believe her?"
h6AkvAj_hao,11186819,11191622,Six.  MATT: She's hard to read.
h6AkvAj_hao,11193299,11199569,You can go ahead and roll.  If you wish to feel-- or you can roll for a placebo  or you can roll for deception and let them know
h6AkvAj_hao,11199569,11205209,what you want to let them know.  TRAVIS: Oh my god. MARISHA: Jesus.
h6AkvAj_hao,11205209,11210647,(laughter)  ROBBIE: There's a lot going on over there.  LIAM: She has pixies and sprites falling out
h6AkvAj_hao,11210648,11216477,"of her dress left and right.  ASHLEY: Oh, goodness me! LAURA: What is this?  ASHLEY: 21."
h6AkvAj_hao,11216477,11220416,(laughter)  LIAM: Fucking fey. ROBBIE: Chaos.  LIAM: Fey creatures.
h6AkvAj_hao,11221481,11226899,"TALIESIN: 10 seconds of Buster Keaton  and then (whoosh), yeah.  ASHLEY: I mean, we're certainly not--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11228179,11237032,"My family never held place in court, but I mean  we're basically royalty there."
h6AkvAj_hao,11237032,11240816,LIAM: You guys have a lot of enemies?  ASHLEY: Um.
h6AkvAj_hao,11245004,11251455,How would you describe an enemy?  ROBBIE: Someone who wants to kill you or your loved ones.
h6AkvAj_hao,11251455,11252921,LIAM: That. ASHLEY: Mm.
h6AkvAj_hao,11256694,11262049,"ASHLEY: I mean, I want to say yes.  Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,11262049,11270209,"But--  You know, it's, that's everybody.  Don't you just get mad and you want to just kill somebody?"
h6AkvAj_hao,11272599,11277829,"ROBBIE: You know, from--  ASHLEY: I mean, I don-- You know what I mean.  That's a little bit dramatic, but--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11277829,11282959,"LIAM: I know what you mean.  ASHLEY: Yeah.  I think it's just, I mean, I think--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11284939,11290559,"I think it's just, I don't know.  Maybe he just, he's one of those people"
h6AkvAj_hao,11290559,11296509,"that could-- is kind of like Imogen.  You know, who could, look into somebody's mind"
h6AkvAj_hao,11296509,11303799,"and pick up on their person,  their stuff, you know? ROBBIE: Didn't he"
h6AkvAj_hao,11303799,11309649,"smell you? Am I incorrect?  LIAM: Yeah. ROBBIE: Yeah.  ASHLEY: He did, but fey do have, we have a very"
h6AkvAj_hao,11309649,11315719,good sense of smell.  ROBBIE: But he knew you.  Proper name by your smell.
h6AkvAj_hao,11315719,11321017,I can only assume he smelled someone close to you.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,11321017,11326193,"ASHLEY: I mean, I do have a pretty strong scent.  LIAM: I just smell flowers."
h6AkvAj_hao,11326193,11331942,"ROBBIE: Mm. ASHLEY: Mm.  ROBBIE: All right.  ASHLEY: It's a bit strange to me,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11331942,11337119,"I will say that. MARISHA: I imagine she smells  like a ferret.  (laughter) ROBBIE: Yeah.  ASHLEY: A little musky, like a little musky."
h6AkvAj_hao,11337119,11342979,"LIAM: Yeah. ASHLEY: Like Frito paws.  (laughter)  LAURA: Oh, Frito paws, I love Frito paws.  LIAM: You're rolling around in a flower bed."
h6AkvAj_hao,11342979,11348808,MARISHA: Yeah.  (laughter)  Eucalyptus.  LIAM: Do you-- Do you--
h6AkvAj_hao,11348808,11354766,I guess you would have told us already.  Do you have any kind of insight into--  What that--
h6AkvAj_hao,11355849,11359809,Ira would want?
h6AkvAj_hao,11361019,11367189,Here?  Do fey cross over  a lot? You did.
h6AkvAj_hao,11370729,11376971,"ASHLEY: I don't know, I imagine that they do.  But I don't know what--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11378959,11385989,"I don't know what he wants.  I mean, I just figured  that maybe he just knew me because"
h6AkvAj_hao,11385989,11391177,of where we're both from.  But I mean--
h6AkvAj_hao,11392669,11402125,He could know my parents.  He could know my grandmother.  He could know anyone else in my family.
h6AkvAj_hao,11403829,11407367,But I don't know his goals.
h6AkvAj_hao,11409676,11415183,LIAM: Last question.  How worried do you think we should be about him?
h6AkvAj_hao,11417489,11421552,ROBBIE: That's a great question.  Because it's non-specific.
h6AkvAj_hao,11422509,11430841,"ASHLEY: I mean, my gut reaction  is to not be worried at all.  So, I don't know."
h6AkvAj_hao,11430841,11436309,"MARISHA: I want to be Fearne when I grew up.  LAURA: Yeah.  LIAM: Not a suspicious insight check, but to just,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11436309,11439882,'what the is fuck is going on' insight check.
h6AkvAj_hao,11441449,11447794,16.  ASHLEY: Be a little worried.
h6AkvAj_hao,11449377,11455119,"Just a little bit, I mean, I really don't know  much about him, I just know I've heard stories,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11455119,11459212,but they're all from my grandmother.  So it's possible.
h6AkvAj_hao,11460509,11466460,"She just--  They could've dated, you know?  Then she just talked shit about him."
h6AkvAj_hao,11466460,11471898,"(laughter)  Was like, ""Bah, he's a nightmare,"" you know?  ROBBIE: You got an ex-boyfriend vibe from him."
h6AkvAj_hao,11471899,11477252,"Is that what you're trying to say?  (laughter)  ASHLEY: I mean,  she's dated-- MARISHA: That's how he got"
h6AkvAj_hao,11477252,11482965,"Nightmare King.  ASHLEY: Just all types.  ROBBIE: Didn't text back for three days.  MARISHA: Yeah. ""He's just a nightmare."""
h6AkvAj_hao,11482965,11490629,"ASHLEY: He ghosted her.  ROBBIE: Yeah, essentially. TRAVIS: Names are stuck.  ASHLEY: She's dated all types."
h6AkvAj_hao,11490629,11495719,So it wouldn't surprise me.  LAURA: He was pretty cute.  ASHLEY: He was pretty cute.
h6AkvAj_hao,11495719,11501360,"He had, you know--  LIAM: What are you doing in here?  LAURA: I'm sorry, I'm trying to sleep.  ASHLEY: Imogen just said he was cute."
h6AkvAj_hao,11501361,11507358,LIAM and ROBBIE: Ugh.  (laughter)  MATT: This is the weirdest fucking group.
h6AkvAj_hao,11507358,11513297,"ROBBIE: Creep! MARISHA: Yeah.  ASHLEY: I mean, listen,  he really should get his teeth fixed and--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11513297,11519560,"TRAVIS: It's one o'clock in the morning!  What are you talking about? TALIESIN: Walls are thin, y'all.  LIAM: All right, all right."
h6AkvAj_hao,11519560,11526904,"I mush the side of Fearne's furry leg as my pillow  and my legs go over Dorian's legs,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11526904,11531918,and I make my little hammock that I usually do.  TRAVIS: I got to pee! (quick footsteps)  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,11531918,11538314,LAURA: You're just sleeping in their room.  (laughter)  ASHLEY: I give him a pat on the head.
h6AkvAj_hao,11538314,11543908,"LAURA: Chetney, get your own room. ASHLEY: And Dorian, too.  (laughter)  ASHLEY: We'll be okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,11543909,11546919,If push comes to shove--
h6AkvAj_hao,11551064,11556159,I'll make sure to...  kill him. I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,11556159,11562909,"I'll figure it out, we'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out, trust me.  Trust me!  LIAM: You're scary as hell, too, so I'll take it."
h6AkvAj_hao,11562909,11568947,"ASHLEY: Okay, good night, I love you guys.  LIAM: Love love. ROBBIE: Love.  MATT: Laudna."
h6AkvAj_hao,11568947,11576449,MARISHA: Oh!  LIAM: (punching noise)  MATT: You watch.  You wake up as Imogen
h6AkvAj_hao,11576449,11582169,is shifting in her sleep.  LAURA: Fuck.  MATT: You.
h6AkvAj_hao,11582169,11587029,"MARISHA: I wake up first.  MATT: Yeah, you wake up first  and see her...  shifting."
h6AkvAj_hao,11588279,11595169,"MARISHA: I am not going to wake her up.  I'm going to immediately start--  I'm going to start scribbling anything she says, though."
h6AkvAj_hao,11595169,11601505,Keep going.  MATT: The storm returns.
h6AkvAj_hao,11601505,11607979,LAURA: Fuck.  MATT: You hear the crack.
h6AkvAj_hao,11607979,11612852,Earth and land pull apart in the distance  as trees vanish beyond the horizon.
h6AkvAj_hao,11614029,11620529,"The green, now brown and red fields falling away.  You pull at the door"
h6AkvAj_hao,11620529,11626486,on the house and it is locked shut.  That familiar sense...
h6AkvAj_hao,11627939,11634908,of nowhere to go.  Your hair's tossed painfully across your face.
h6AkvAj_hao,11634909,11641367,Your eyes burn from the impact of dust  and rock and shards of glass and sand.
h6AkvAj_hao,11645019,11650831,"You hear your mother's voice once again.  ""Imogen!"
h6AkvAj_hao,11650831,11657779,"""Run!  ""Run far!""  You glance back in the storm,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11657779,11663917,and see the shadow...  of two people. LAURA: Oh no.  MATT: Holding hands.
h6AkvAj_hao,11665199,11669924,Young.  You can't make out their distinct shapes.
h6AkvAj_hao,11671179,11676219,But they just stand there.  Their silhouettes consumed
h6AkvAj_hao,11676219,11681316,by the storm as they vanish  into the chaotic mass.
h6AkvAj_hao,11683070,11688509,LAURA: Are they the twins?  MATT: Is what you hear from her voice.
h6AkvAj_hao,11689949,11698170,"MARISHA: I just write down, ""Twins.""  LAURA: I take off running as fast as I can."
h6AkvAj_hao,11699222,11705665,"MATT: You abandon the house,  and run into the fields beyond,  and run, and run as hard as you can."
h6AkvAj_hao,11705665,11712835,"Horses fleeing in the distance,  you see trees falling,  you hear and feel the ground shudder and break beneath you,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11712835,11721245,"but you run, you run as hard as you can.  Her voice still echoing in your ears,  fading as the sound (whooshes) gets louder,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11721245,11727470,"and louder,  and louder. LAURA: (grunts)  MATT: And louder! LAURA: Ah!"
h6AkvAj_hao,11728918,11733321,MATT: (gasps) You wake up!  MARISHA: Imogen!
h6AkvAj_hao,11735375,11740823,Just grab her by the hand.  I'm so sorry.
h6AkvAj_hao,11741939,11747081,"I didn't want to wake you up because I wanted to,  maybe there are answers."
h6AkvAj_hao,11748205,11754645,I go and I get her a glass of water.  LAURA: I saw somebody again.
h6AkvAj_hao,11755609,11762026,"MARISHA: You...  You said ""twins.""  You said ""twins"" out loud."
h6AkvAj_hao,11763995,11770035,Did you see the Lumas twins?  LAURA: I don't know.
h6AkvAj_hao,11772085,11775233,"I don't know, I saw two figures  standing next to each other."
h6AkvAj_hao,11787415,11794097,My mom was telling me to stay away from it.  MARISHA: She was talking to you?
h6AkvAj_hao,11798235,11803470,LAURA: Just run.  MARISHA: Run.  LAURA: Always.
h6AkvAj_hao,11806205,11813145,"MARISHA: The twins, they...  they passed some time ago."
h6AkvAj_hao,11813145,11819175,"LAURA: Yeah.  MARISHA: It's not like with Bertrand?  LAURA: No, I've never seen anything like that before,"
h6AkvAj_hao,11819175,11825797,Bertrand was the first.  Do I just see dead people now?
h6AkvAj_hao,11829515,11833397,"MARISHA: You know, it doesn't--"
h6AkvAj_hao,11835595,11839038,"Dead, yes, but it feels like  there must be another connecting factor."
h6AkvAj_hao,11841115,11845961,LAURA: What is this storm?  What's a red storm about?
h6AkvAj_hao,11847115,11853455,"Have you ever seen one?  MARISHA: No, can't say that I have."
h6AkvAj_hao,11853455,11860150,"I just start brushing her hair,  and giving her a little bit of a scalp massage."
h6AkvAj_hao,11863625,11870085,Hang on a second.  I'm going to step outside and crack the door.  Where are the moons right now?
h6AkvAj_hao,11870085,11876305,"MATT: Just looking up, it is a somewhat clear sky.  There's some cloud coverage, but it's broken,"

h6AkvAj_hao,12679945,12686925,"and there was a process of you adding your own blood  to this vial as part of the attunement process.  MARISHA: Cool.  MATT: So you need to expel some of the crimson within,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12686925,12693395,"and then add some of your own.  LIAM: Do you have any?  MARISHA: Barely, not a lot.  Couldn't donate two quarts."

h6AkvAj_hao,12761075,12767030,"MARISHA: Holy fuck!  MATT: But you can only use that once  per dawn, essentially.  LAURA: Once per dong."
h6AkvAj_hao,12767030,12772227,"LIAM: Now for wrath--  MARISHA: Worth it! LIAM: Now for ruin.  MARISHA: All right, all right!  Great."
h6AkvAj_hao,12772227,12779114,"LAURA: Dongs are so powerful!  MATT: So you all spend a craft day making masks.  What do you make?  TRAVIS: Well, actually, I don't make any masks."
h6AkvAj_hao,12779115,12785564,"You just see me in a pile of wood chips,  shavings everywhere, working vigorously."
h6AkvAj_hao,12785565,12789312,"I say: Hah!  Finally, I'm done."
h6AkvAj_hao,12790695,12799215,"You see, custom orders, they get priority.  I want to thank you for guiding me  through that whole wardrobe process, that was a nightmare."
h6AkvAj_hao,12799215,12805164,"I don't know how you do it.  Anyway, as requested, here's your airship."
h6AkvAj_hao,12805164,12812958,"MARISHA: Oh my god! (laughter)  ASHLEY: Oh my god.  TRAVIS: All wood, no outside materials."
h6AkvAj_hao,12812958,12818795,"Made by hand, just for you.  ROBBIE: It's amazing, it's so light!  What is this, balsa wood?  ASHLEY: That's amazing."
h6AkvAj_hao,12818795,12823943,"TRAVIS: Just leave a little mystery in there.  It's the S.S. Brontë.  ROBBIE: All right, the S.S. Brontë?"
h6AkvAj_hao,12823943,12829222,"You've even carved it in the side!  TRAVIS: Yeah, it's right there.  ROBBIE: This is, without a doubt,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12830075,12836555,"one of the top five gifts I've ever gotten.  It's fantastic.  TRAVIS: That sounds like a disappointing life, but okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,12836555,12841637,"We're square, right? (laughter)  ROBBIE: Square. TRAVIS: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,12841637,12847595,"TALIESIN: Wow.  (laughter)  ROBBIE: I shall treasure it forever, and I'm going to--  TRAVIS: That's one off the list."
h6AkvAj_hao,12847595,12854462,"We're getting even, motherfuckers.  ASHLEY: That is so beautiful!  TALIESIN: I don't know what I expected,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12855445,12862263,but it was-- That's impressive.  TRAVIS: That's MC-level stuff.  You got to raise your expectation level.
h6AkvAj_hao,12862263,12868131,"ASHLEY: I'm going to try to steal it.  TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to make it easy  for you to disappoint me.  MARISHA: Immediately."
h6AkvAj_hao,12869977,12875965,LAURA: Just on the table in front of all of us.  ASHLEY: 14.  MATT: Make a perception check.  LAURA: Can we all make a perception check
h6AkvAj_hao,12875965,12881797,"since she's doing it--?  MARISHA: Since she's just reaching across the table?  ROBBIE: This is for display, I put it in my pocket for sure.  LAURA: Oh. ROBBIE: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,12881797,12887225,LIAM: My passive is 20.  ROBBIE: Oh boy!  Five! (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,12887225,12892955,"MATT: So, you, in the moment of connecting  with this delightful new friend you've made,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12892955,12900315,"do not notice this just vanish from the table  in front of you, the rest of you all see it.  It is the most overt just reach over and grab"
h6AkvAj_hao,12900315,12905962,"you've ever witnessed. ROBBIE: Did you cast  some kind of invisibility spell on it?  That's so neat, Chet!  ASHLEY: I'm just holding it. Wow."
h6AkvAj_hao,12905962,12911407,(laughter)  It really is so well done.
h6AkvAj_hao,12911407,12918938,"TRAVIS: Fearne!  No skipping the line, that's not for you.  ASHLEY: I'm not taking it,  I'm just holding it to play with it."
h6AkvAj_hao,12918938,12924119,(laughter)  TRAVIS: Okay.  ROBBIE: You can play for it for--  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,12924119,12931049,"There's no watches in this realm!  You can play for it for  10 minutes, Fearne, 10 minutes."
h6AkvAj_hao,12931049,12936992,"ASHLEY: Okay. ROBBIE: Then you  have to give it back.  ASHLEY: I put a bowl of water in front of me,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12936992,12940940,and I put it in the bowl of water.  LAURA: (gasps) SAM: Nice.  LAURA: It's an airship.
h6AkvAj_hao,12942295,12948094,ASHLEY: Oops.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,12948094,12953887,"Give me some string.  (laughter)  I tie some string around it, put it over the--"
h6AkvAj_hao,12953887,12959325,"Woo! (laughter)  TALIESIN: It's fucking-- SAM: Dripping on us.  LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, bring it over here."
h6AkvAj_hao,12959325,12964995,"I tie my new rope to it, and I go, whoof!  MATT: (whooshes) (clicks)"
h6AkvAj_hao,12964995,12971600,"It affixes.  LIAM: It's up there.  LAURA: Oh, what if we can't get it back down?  MARISHA: Oh!  LIAM: Bink, whew, boof."
h6AkvAj_hao,12972857,12979505,"LAURA: Okay.  LIAM: (sneezes) Oh jeez! ROBBIE: Oh, come on!  TRAVIS: F.C.G., I was wondering,"
h6AkvAj_hao,12979505,12984994,"I was working real hard on that one,  and I cut myself a few times.  Could you fix my fingers, please?"
h6AkvAj_hao,12984995,12993604,"SAM: Heal them? Sure, sure. TRAVIS: Yeah.  SAM: I will,  I will bless them with eternal life."
h6AkvAj_hao,12993605,12998848,"No, I'll-- TRAVIS: Eternal life?!  (laughter)  ASHLEY and TALIESIN: Just your fingers!  TALIESIN: They will last way longer than you will."
h6AkvAj_hao,12998848,13007475,"TRAVIS: I'll just be a rotting corpse.  ROBBIE: F.C.G., the middle name is ""Christ.""  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,13007475,13014352,"TRAVIS: Broke the cast.  SAM: I will heal them. TRAVIS: Thank you.  MATT: Don't ruin his story twist later.  ROBBIE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
h6AkvAj_hao,13014352,13019683,"TRAVIS: Now that that's out of the way,  I will start carving a very delicate wood wolf mask,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13019683,13025026,"I will start carving a very delicate wood wolf mask,  that will go just under my eyes.  MATT: Okay, cool, awesome, I dig it."
h6AkvAj_hao,13025026,13030319,"LAURA: Ooh, a wooden one? MATT: So he's working on that,  Dorian, what do you craft for your mask?  ROBBIE: Oh, mine is made out of fabric,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13030320,13035354,"and I've muddled a sticky paste together,  and molded the fabric, and hardened it"
h6AkvAj_hao,13035355,13039819,"to make it look like it's fabric blowing in the wind.  MATT: Ooh. TRAVIS: Fabric, huh?"
h6AkvAj_hao,13040775,13044364,"ROBBIE: Don't judge me.  MATT: I love it. Laudna, what'd you make?"
h6AkvAj_hao,13046645,13054723,"MARISHA: Yeah, I take the trash,  and some of my scrap leather that I have."
h6AkvAj_hao,13054723,13062335,"MATT: Yeah, yeah.  MARISHA: I mold the leather, and take some of the--  I gather all the hair that was in the trash pile."
h6AkvAj_hao,13062335,13070495,"MATT: Yeah. MARISHA: And I glue it,  and I make a fox-like mask  that matches my fucked up fox's face on my dress."
h6AkvAj_hao,13070495,13077955,"MATT: I will say, go ahead and roll a dexterity check.  LIAM: That's messed up.  MARISHA: Dexterity check?"
h6AkvAj_hao,13077955,13084385,"MATT: Yeah, just I need your dexterity modifier.  MARISHA: Okay.  Mm, mm, 19."
h6AkvAj_hao,13084385,13090221,"MATT: 19. MARISHA: Yeah.  MATT: It matches your fox head wonderfully,  which means it is  equally terrifying. MARISHA: Horrifying."
h6AkvAj_hao,13090221,13096475,"MATT: Yeah, it is--  MARISHA: It's perfect.  It's got little patches of hair on it, it's good.  MATT: Great, awesome."
h6AkvAj_hao,13096475,13102325,"SAM: No cadaver skin, right?  So I'll just--  MATT: Sorry, bud! Not this time."
h6AkvAj_hao,13102325,13107505,TRAVIS: Not with that level of effort.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,13107505,13113016,"SAM: I'll just Clark Kent it,  I'll just have some big glasses."
h6AkvAj_hao,13113016,13118702,"MATT: Okay, great. (laughter)  MATT: No one will notice. TRAVIS: Yeah!  MATT: Perfect.  LIAM: Where'd F.C.G. go?"
h6AkvAj_hao,13118702,13124906,"SAM: Oh, it's me, I'm right here!  TRAVIS: Who's this scholar you're with?  ROBBIE: Oh my god. MATT: Perfect."
h6AkvAj_hao,13124906,13133605,Fearne.  ASHLEY: I'm going to make something that looks  like a craft piece that a five-year-old
h6AkvAj_hao,13133605,13140115,"would make for Thanksgiving, or at church.  Where it's you see the white glue,  you see the feathers are all askew,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13140115,13145618,"it doesn't look great.  SAM: Nice, nice, nice, nice.  MARISHA: Macaroni on it. MATT: Well done.  ASHLEY: Yeah, macaroni."
h6AkvAj_hao,13145618,13153484,"(laughter)  MATT: Perfect. Imogen?  LAURA: I'm going to use leather, and just"
h6AkvAj_hao,13153485,13159695,make a nice little eye one  out of a cream-colored leather.  I'm going to get some of the glass beads
h6AkvAj_hao,13159695,13167401,"that I can find, anything shimmery,  that creates an iridescent vibe,  glued all over it, something electric."
h6AkvAj_hao,13167402,13173325,"If I can find some beads,  I would love to create a little extra piece  that comes around the head,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13173325,13179256,"and comes down over the hair as well.  MATT: Okay. TALIESIN: You can get beads.  MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check for me,  if you don't mind."
h6AkvAj_hao,13179256,13185398,"SAM: Guidance!  TRAVIS: Earn this mask.  LAURA: Come on!  TRAVIS: I see it from here. TALIESIN: Ooh, it's rough."
h6AkvAj_hao,13186315,13189819,LAURA: That's a-- LIAM: That's a cocked pyramid.  LAURA: Fuck this.
h6AkvAj_hao,13192015,13197812,"Six.  TALIESIN: Since we have a big team,  can we give her some assist?  LIAM: She is beauty, she is grace."
h6AkvAj_hao,13197812,13202874,MARISHA: Fuck craft day.  LAURA: Fuck craft day!  Eight.  MATT: You're fine.
h6AkvAj_hao,13202874,13208834,"(laughter)  MATT: Look, these are simple crafts.  There's no threat to any of these."
h6AkvAj_hao,13208834,13214255,"(laughter)  TRAVIS: Thank you, Matt.  MATT: Genuinely, all I want to know  is if anyone rolls a natural one."
h6AkvAj_hao,13214255,13219315,"It's going to look real janky.  That's primarily why I'm having anybody roll.  If they have a semi-complicated idea,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13219315,13224507,"I just want to see if they royally fuck it up,  and then we can maybe get to experience that.  But you're fine."
h6AkvAj_hao,13224507,13231175,"LAURA: All right.  MATT: What you got?  LIAM: I go sit down by Chetney,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13231175,13236655,"and I grab one of his discarded chunks of wood  from what he was making, and I set it down."
h6AkvAj_hao,13236655,13245515,"I go into my bag,  and I take out my simple set of carpentry tools.  LAURA and TRAVIS: (gasp)  LIAM: I start to carve a little wooden mask."
h6AkvAj_hao,13245515,13251145,"TRAVIS: Oh my god.  LIAM: It's nothing super elaborate, but it's okay,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13251145,13257985,"and it's got a cherry blossom design to it,  both the shape of it, and then carved,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13257985,13263843,etched into the surface of it as well.  TRAVIS: I just start singing.  ♪ You've got the touch ♪  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,13263843,13271295,"ALL: ♪ You've got the power ♪  LIAM: I'm no artist, but  my mom taught me a couple of things."
h6AkvAj_hao,13271295,13276515,TRAVIS: I have a whole new level of respect for you.  We have to talk.
h6AkvAj_hao,13276515,13283285,"I have so much I can share, I'm an open book.  LIAM: I will read that book."
h6AkvAj_hao,13283285,13288287,TRAVIS: Your start is good.  Is that where you're leaving it?
h6AkvAj_hao,13288287,13293776,"LIAM: No, I--  (laughter)  LIAM: That's just five minutes in.  TRAVIS: Oh, okay. LIAM: I'm going to go  another, like, 20."
h6AkvAj_hao,13293776,13300345,"It's not going to be-- I can't make that.  TRAVIS: Well, I mean, you know,  that's hundreds of years of experience,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13300345,13305695,"but you know, if you want me to take  just a polishing look at whatever you do,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13305695,13311115,"I would be more than happy to give, you know?  LIAM: Well, can we start here,  and we'll call this the beginning,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13311115,13314597,and then you can give me tips as the weeks go by?
h6AkvAj_hao,13316375,13321261,TRAVIS: I would love that.  LIAM: All right.
h6AkvAj_hao,13322585,13327735,"MATT: So how detailed are you going with this?  LIAM: I mean, I want it to look pretty,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13327735,13335294,"but I'm not an artisan.  LAURA: You're not an MC?  LIAM: My art is the sword, not the carving tools."
h6AkvAj_hao,13335294,13341088,"MATT: We'll see about that, roll a dexterity check.  LIAM: But I'm proficient in it!  MATT: You are.  LIAM: Ooh, a one, I'm going to reroll it!"
h6AkvAj_hao,13341088,13346675,"MATT: Because you can do that as a halfling,  damn it, that was my one chance!  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,13346675,13351705,"LIAM: That is a 23.  MATT: 23, it is, even with the short time,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13351705,13356695,an impressive display of attention to detail and form.
h6AkvAj_hao,13357612,13364845,"While not on par with a master craftsman  such as yourself, there is a hidden thread of talent"
h6AkvAj_hao,13364845,13370404,in this little halfling here.  TRAVIS: I'm so proud.  You really have a gift.
h6AkvAj_hao,13370405,13376985,"Sometimes all you have to do is water the plant.  You're an Ashari, right?  LIAM: Yeah, I was thinking about home."
h6AkvAj_hao,13378555,13382738,TRAVIS: It shows.  May I compliment you on such a fine endeavor?
h6AkvAj_hao,13383865,13388858,"LIAM: Yes?  TRAVIS: Truly, I don't fuck around when it comes to wood."
h6AkvAj_hao,13389695,13395577,"Game respect game.  (laughter)  LIAM: Well, I bow before the master."
h6AkvAj_hao,13397500,13405319,TRAVIS: May it serve you well.  SAM: What is happening?  LIAM: I look down at his liver-spotted head and smile.
h6AkvAj_hao,13405319,13411909,(laughter)  LAURA: You just randomly get in your head:  Fucking piece of shit!
h6AkvAj_hao,13411909,13418089,(laughter)  TALIESIN: Do you know what the Ashari--  You know what? Never--
h6AkvAj_hao,13418089,13424691,"You know the Ashari from that?  Mm.  TRAVIS: Well, I remember asking after the--  TALIESIN: Okay.  TRAVIS: He was sent to search for the--"
h6AkvAj_hao,13424692,13430564,"TALIESIN: You just threw it out there.  TRAVIS: Oh.  MATT: By the way, Ashton, what have you made?  TALIESIN: Well!  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,13430565,13436345,"TALIESIN: I took some scrap leather, and some scrap cloth,  and mushed all this together with some glue,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13436345,13443895,"oiled up, and pressed it to my face  to get a rough fucking shape.  I've also slightly modded the outfit,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13443895,13451324,"because I'm not showing any fucking skin.  Gloves, boots, full thing,  as much as I can. MATT: Okay.  TALIESIN: I'm making a big, full, I'm grabbing it,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13451325,13457076,"and wrapping it, and tying it behind my head,  so it covers everything  but the purple crystals on my head."
h6AkvAj_hao,13457076,13464645,"MATT: Okay. TALIESIN: Everything hidden.  Slicing it open, opening up the eyes,  and then just using some red thread to tie it,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13464645,13471245,"tie the mouth together a little bit.  TRAVIS: Yes. MATT: Ooh!  TALIESIN: I should, if I did it right,  look like the Nightmare King."
h6AkvAj_hao,13471245,13476259,ALL: Ooh!  ROBBIE: What?!  MATT: Roll a dexterity check for me.
h6AkvAj_hao,13476259,13481319,"TRAVIS: Oh, you're going in,  you're going in half cocked.  MARISHA: Hell yeah. SAM: Guidance!  TALIESIN: Dexterity check? MATT: Yes."
h6AkvAj_hao,13481320,13483873,TALIESIN: I'll take that Guidance.  SAM: Guidance! MARISHA: Come on!
h6AkvAj_hao,13486630,13491718,LAURA: Yes!  TRAVIS: Low key we will not be.  TALIESIN: 21.
h6AkvAj_hao,13491718,13500398,"MATT: That is, while a creative interpretation  with limited materials,  for those who have very closely seen"
h6AkvAj_hao,13500398,13507158,"the Nightmare King in person,  it definitely evokes the shape and the dread."
h6AkvAj_hao,13507158,13512488,"TALIESIN: Dog barks at me, I bark back louder.  MATT: That's fucking cool.  TRAVIS: Plus anyone that's seen him,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13512488,13518527,"have a reaction.  TALIESIN: Fucking thought, aren't they?  ASHLEY: That's such a good idea.  MATT: That's cool. LIAM: I think I saw him in the 90s  at the Limelight."
h6AkvAj_hao,13518527,13525838,"(laughter)  TALIESIN: So yeah, no skin.  Just that, that big crazy-ass. MATT: You got it. Okay, okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,13525838,13531656,ASHLEY: I just traced my hands.  SAM: Cool.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,13531656,13536837,"TALIESIN: Feathers, feathers! ASHLEY: And feathers.  TRAVIS: Like Pan's Labyrinth."
h6AkvAj_hao,13536837,13542776,"TALIESIN: Little macaroni.  ASHLEY: Yeah, like a Pan's Labyrinth-y--  ROBBIE: Turkey. ASHLEY: Turkey, yeah.  ROBBIE: That's funny."
h6AkvAj_hao,13542776,13548648,MATT: Easy enough to scavenge feathers  that had fallen from Effid the Fallen's den
h6AkvAj_hao,13548648,13555138,"not far from where the Krook House is, yeah.  Okay.  So masks are assembled. MARISHA: Then, real quick,"
h6AkvAj_hao,13555138,13561275,I bust the doll.  MATT: Okay.  MARISHA: And put Pâté in the tiny doll clothes.
h6AkvAj_hao,13561275,13566969,"LAURA: Yes! SAM: Great.  MATT: Good call.  LAURA: You should keep the doll head, though,  because it's useful."
h6AkvAj_hao,13566969,13572687,TALIESIN: Use the whole doll.  You don't want to waste it.  ASHLEY: You could use something.  MARISHA: That's great.
h6AkvAj_hao,13572687,13578204,LIAM: Jeez.  ASHLEY: Pâté!  LAURA: You look so handsome!
h6AkvAj_hao,13578204,13583279,"ASHLEY: You, sir!  MARISHA: (as Pâté) ""Oh, look at you.""  ASHLEY: Oh, don't you get shy."
h6AkvAj_hao,13583280,13588951,"Don't you get shy!  MARISHA: ""You better stop that,  ""you're giving me a chubber!""  (laughter) ASHLEY: Oh wow!"
h6AkvAj_hao,13588951,13594457,"LAURA: Come on, Pâté!  TALIESIN: I was ready to say Professor Pâté,  but now I'm upset.  LAURA: Pâté."
h6AkvAj_hao,13594457,13600668,"MATT: Milo leans in and goes,  ""I kind of hate it,  ""and I kind of love it.""  TALIESIN: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,13600668,13605747,"MATT: ""I mostly hate it."" LAURA: Pâté, you promised  you'd stop drinking.  MARISHA: It's true.  Go home, Pâté. TALIESIN: Both of them"

h6AkvAj_hao,15106825,15113645,"as you approach, or as you fall behind,  ""Follow my steps, exactly.""  Leads you through a hall on the far left,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15113645,15121225,"then makes a quick right  and then follows on the right-hand side.  Heads to a door, and he turns the knob,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15121225,15127215,"takes his cane, and slips it through the top of the door,  and holds on something, pushes the door open,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15127215,15131881,"and then hits a latch.  Something comes and hangs for a second.  He goes,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15132916,15140665,"""We're safe to enter.""  Enters the room, and all the furniture  in this room is covered in sheets, and there's dust."

h6AkvAj_hao,15192915,15198314,"but it's got a regal look to it.  And, as I look through the clothes,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15198315,15204825,"I find something in the same color pattern blue  that I have, but the same thing, sharp shoulders,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15204825,15210573,"quick lines, nothing, no flair.  It's very, almost militaristic,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15210573,15216285,"but severe, but elegant.  That's a whole suit jacket thing."
h6AkvAj_hao,15216285,15219896,"I'm going to grab that.  As I do,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15221465,15227245,"put those things away,  I'm going to reach into my bag and pull out  the outfit that I had,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15227245,15232245,which was this chiffon outfit that I had previously gotten
h6AkvAj_hao,15234962,15242505,"a long time ago, and look at it for a minute.  Then I'll pull out the mâché mask that I had,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15242505,15248534,"and I'll crumble them both up  and throw them in the bottom of the bureau,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15248535,15254546,and leave them behind and go back down to the group.  MATT: Okay.  Eshteross carefully leads you out of the chamber
h6AkvAj_hao,15254546,15262877,"and back down the hall. (laughs)  As you're walking alongside and head down the stairs,  he goes, ""I think this will do."""

h6AkvAj_hao,15303245,15311026,"and I'll just write it down on a piece of paper.  Secondsun,  just like it sounds, but it's S-U-N, instead."
h6AkvAj_hao,15311026,15318468,"And pass it off to him.  MATT: ""And this is of which nobility?"""
h6AkvAj_hao,15319828,15325132,"ROBBIE: Nobility's a broad term.  MATT: ""Location?  ""Homestead?"" ROBBIE: Everywhere."

h6AkvAj_hao,15375738,15381454,"LAURA: Yeah.  LIAM: I'll be with Dorian.  TRAVIS: Sounds like Ashton is as well, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15381455,15387425,"TALIESIN: Well, it depends.  I honestly think that, considering this is your play,  I think you should really have final say"
h6AkvAj_hao,15387425,15393312,over who you have next to you.  MARISHA: I think you're essentially
h6AkvAj_hao,15393313,15400375,"plan A on the ring swap-a-roo?  ROBBIE: Sure.  MARISHA: Then Eshteross' group will be plan B,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15400375,15406285,"if that doesn't work.  SAM: You don't know how, I mean,  we can't know how you're going to swap out the ring"
h6AkvAj_hao,15406285,15411564,"ahead of time, but you should have someone with you  who can distract."
h6AkvAj_hao,15411565,15417234,MARISHA: Correct.  SAM: Someone who can maybe magically assist somehow--  MARISHA: Correct. SAM: Or buff.
h6AkvAj_hao,15417235,15423215,"ROBBIE: Do we really have a plan, though?  This feels a little bit, by the seat of your pants."
h6AkvAj_hao,15423215,15429995,"SAM: Well, it's like yada, yada, yada,  Dorian gets the ring, we go home.  (laughter)  ROBBIE: What if it's not Dorian gets the ring, though?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15429995,15436099,"What if it's one of you guys  get the ring? SAM: Yeah, well.  MARISHA: Maybe it's best.  LAURA: That's true. If you're talking to him,  maybe one of us can distract him."
h6AkvAj_hao,15437075,15443826,"TRAVIS: Who has great sleight of hand?  TALIESIN: Pretty good.  LAURA: I'm not very good. ASHLEY: Well, not really me."
h6AkvAj_hao,15443827,15452905,"MARISHA: Well, you're good. TRAVIS: Six, seven. Yeah.  ROBBIE: I'm pretty good with my hands.  MARISHA: Five.  TALIESIN: In a perfect world, we somehow knock him,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15452905,15458025,"get him to off-balance, get him to drop the ring  and then assist and hand it back to him"
h6AkvAj_hao,15458025,15464403,and make the switch there.  That's the perfect world.  LIAM: What if we-- MARISHA: It's on his thumb.  He's got to take it off. LIAM: What if we  start out with
h6AkvAj_hao,15466665,15473027,"charm, plying him with wine, getting him comfortable?  Then if he gets loose enough,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15474005,15479034,"you start comparing jewelry.  SAM: Yeah, watch guys love showing off their watches"
h6AkvAj_hao,15479035,15485455,"and stuff. MARISHA: Absolutely!  LIAM: If that doesn't work,  at least he's drunk or half drunk,  and we can then make it,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15485455,15490539,"hopefully a little easier to go for the switcheroo.  LAURA: Yeah, maybe one of us can follow him.  ROBBIE: So, are we trying to balance--"
h6AkvAj_hao,15490539,15498619,"LAURA: If he tries to pick us up or something.  ROBBIE: Yeah, are we trying to balance  between the two parties' hotness?  Like, find a mean amount of attractiveness?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15498619,15504351,"MARISHA: (scoffs) Well, we're all super hot.  ROBBIE: Yes, yes, we're all super duper hot, all of us."

h6AkvAj_hao,15527954,15534415,"ASHLEY: I do think that  whoever is going to be in your group,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15534415,15540810,I do feel like Imogen should be with you  so she can listen in.  I feel like that would be--
h6AkvAj_hao,15540810,15547246,She can tell us what's going on.  ROBBIE: Sure. MARISHA: That's true.  ASHLEY: And listen to him. LAURA: That's true.
h6AkvAj_hao,15547246,15554895,"ROBBIE: I've always enjoyed having you at my side.  MARISHA: If that's the case, maybe Ashton,  with his Nightmare King mask"
h6AkvAj_hao,15554895,15559407,"could be an interesting distraction,  maybe get some interesting thoughts."
h6AkvAj_hao,15560745,15566985,"TALIESIN: I am very loud, intimidating muscle,  as opposed to quiet, subtle emergency muscle."
h6AkvAj_hao,15566985,15571438,I would be happy to just stand behind you  and look menacing as fuck.
h6AkvAj_hao,15573229,15578805,"LAURA: If, just devil's advocate,  if Armand is connected to the Nightmare King,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15578805,15588018,is it playing our hand too much to have Ashton  standing right behind you. TALIESIN: That is the question.  LAURA: It might be better to have him spot Ashton in the crowd
h6AkvAj_hao,15588018,15594787,MARISHA: Then see what happens. LAURA: See his reaction to it.  ROBBIE: Right.  Or an enforcer for each team.
h6AkvAj_hao,15594787,15600035,"Orym, you said you'd like to stay with me. Would you?  LIAM: Yes. Yes. ROBBIE: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,15600035,15606215,"Fearne?  ASHLEY: Of course, I, of course.  I'm just trying to think of who are the best people"
h6AkvAj_hao,15606215,15611981,to keep you safe.  ROBBIE: You're the best person to be with us.
h6AkvAj_hao,15611981,15619280,ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.  SAM: The rest of us will be on  snooping and distracting duty?
h6AkvAj_hao,15619280,15625975,"Trying to figure out-- TRAVIS: Maybe we should have  alternative plans.  Anything that gets hand-in-hand contact.  I mean, if somebody wanted to flirt with Armand,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15625975,15632275,"and I don't know, say give him a palm reading or something,  you know, anything that would get him alone for a second,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15632275,15637555,"and give it a switcheroo.  ASHLEY: We could try lots of things.  Or even if you're comparing jewelry,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15637555,15643665,"if that doesn't work,  you could go into another room and compare scars,  and get naked and..."
h6AkvAj_hao,15644705,15650327,"LAURA: Yeah.  SAM: Or arm wrestling?  ROBBIE: Yeah, that's closer."
h6AkvAj_hao,15650327,15654489,"TRAVIS: Worst case scenario,  we get F.C.G. the face mask he needed.  LAURA: Yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,15655690,15661298,"ROBBIE: All right, it's a plan.  That sounds like a plan. That sounds like a good plan.  MARISHA: So Team Dorian is going to be"
h6AkvAj_hao,15661298,15666535,"Dorian, Orym, Imogen, and Fearne.  ROBBIE: Mm-hmm. ASHLEY: Okay."
h6AkvAj_hao,15666535,15672915,"MARISHA: Team Eshteross is going to be Ashton, F.C.G.,  Laudna, and Chetney?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15672915,15680565,"Does that sound about right? LAURA: That's like the enforcer  team right there.  TALIESIN: Yeah, actually we are definitely a good plan B."
h6AkvAj_hao,15680565,15686688,"I will admit. That's a lot of muscle.  ROBBIE: Sneaky, strong. Creepy?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15686689,15693128,MARISHA: (giggles)  TALIESIN: And Doc.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,15693128,15699857,"SAM: I'm nice.  TRAVIS: What's our absolute,  worst-case scenario, fail-safe plan?"
h6AkvAj_hao,15701335,15708072,"Not just a diversion, but like a calamity.  Everybody's got to get out of the room,  and we're pulling and running and shoving and going,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15708072,15713822,"""Oh, Armand, this way,"" and you grab the--  SAM: Like a fire, or like a--  TRAVIS: Yeah, or like a big fucking werewolf jumps out"
h6AkvAj_hao,15713822,15719685,"in the middle of the room.  SAM: Or maybe-- ROBBIE: Ooh!  MARISHA: I can make everything go dark.  SAM: Oh, that's true."
h6AkvAj_hao,15719685,15724825,"TRAVIS: I also got this bottle of--  MARISHA: Kill the lights.  TRAVIS: Smoke.  LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah."
h6AkvAj_hao,15724825,15731581,MARISHA: Can you see in the dark?  ASHLEY: I can if I'm something else.
h6AkvAj_hao,15731581,15736549,"MARISHA: Okay.  ASHLEY: You know, if I can turn into something else  that can see in the dark."
h6AkvAj_hao,15737445,15742595,"LAURA: Worst case, I can just drape yourself around my neck,  and you can talk to me mentally"
h6AkvAj_hao,15742595,15748292,and tell me which direction to go.  ASHLEY: Great. Great.  LAURA: I'll hold onto your-- you could see in the dark.
h6AkvAj_hao,15748292,15753610,"ROBBIE: Mm-hmm.  SAM: Can you become a hornet or a wasp?  ASHLEY: Sure, I can."
h6AkvAj_hao,15753611,15759737,(laughter)  SAM: Just wondering if you could--  LAURA: Can you fly? Can she?  ASHLEY: I don't think I can fly yet.
h6AkvAj_hao,15759737,15766535,"MARISHA: If he has a bee allergy.  SAM: Well, I was thinking, you could sting his hand and then,  Oh, we got to take that off or it's going to puff up."
h6AkvAj_hao,15766535,15771711,"We got to take that ring off.  MATT: At 8th-level.  ASHLEY: I'm wondering if I can fly?  MATT: At 8th-level, you're able to fly."
h6AkvAj_hao,15773123,15778645,"MARISHA: Just go into anaphylactic shock,  yes. SAM: Yeah.  TALIESIN: I've always been a believer that plans go wrong."
h6AkvAj_hao,15778645,15786175,"Goals always stay the same.  SAM: Yeah.  ASHLEY: I mean, I could always be a beautiful cat.  LAURA: Seriously, we could put the ring in one hand,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15786175,15792415,"trip and fall, grab onto his hand, and take the ring off  while we're falling.  Then go, ""Oops, I took your ring off."
h6AkvAj_hao,15792415,15800208,"""Here you go, let me give it back.""  TRAVIS: This is literally her in any mall of America.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,15800208,15805906,"TRAVIS: (dramatic groan) Get up, please get up.  Stop doing that. (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,15805907,15811982,ASHLEY: We're in Claire's Accessories.  TRAVIS: Please stop it.  (laughter)  TRAVIS: Top of the escalator. Oh!  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,15811983,15819395,LAURA: You really didn't like it when I did that.  TALIESIN: We have communication. We have a goal.  I don't know what else.  We have at least some idea of a plan.
h6AkvAj_hao,15819395,15828725,"ROBBIE: I will say this.  You're speaking of worst-case scenarios.  I've seen that before.  When I was younger, we had a court dance,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15828725,15834398,"if you call it, not quite a ball,  and someone showed up unexpectedly and"
h6AkvAj_hao,15836855,15842283,"they were killed immediately.  LAURA: Wait, what are you--  ROBBIE: Immediately."
h6AkvAj_hao,15843605,15852735,"They were not supposed to be there.  There were internal secrets being shared,  and the guards were told to kill them, and they did."
h6AkvAj_hao,15853325,15860305,"SAM: Are you suggesting that one of us pretend to be killed  by a guard? ROBBIE: No,  I'm suggesting that the worst-case scenario"
h6AkvAj_hao,15860305,15868285,"is not an, oopsy-daisy I fell and the ring is gone.  The worst-case scenario is we get busted for what we are"
h6AkvAj_hao,15868285,15873715,"and we die.  TRAVIS: Oh, that worst-case scenario.  LAURA: Well-- TALIESIN: That's the typical--"
h6AkvAj_hao,15873715,15879444,LAURA: At least you're telling the truth.  ASHLEY: That's true.  LAURA: We are legitimately your companions.
h6AkvAj_hao,15879444,15884444,LAURA: We are legitimately your companions.
h6AkvAj_hao,15884505,15890038,"ROBBIE: Yes, you are.  MARISHA: Well."
h6AkvAj_hao,15890038,15896295,"ROBBIE: Still going to wear the thing?  TRAVIS: The dress? ROBBIE: Yes.  TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like it's very disarming."
h6AkvAj_hao,15897155,15903655,"MARISHA: Oh, speaking of. Chetney,  I was thinking of swapping out of my chisel headpiece"
h6AkvAj_hao,15903655,15912575,"for something maybe a little bit more sleek,  but I noticed your  golden weapons there."
h6AkvAj_hao,15912575,15919005,"Maybe one looks like a nice little hairpin  that I could slip in, in case you need it.  TRAVIS: Yeah, just get it back to me."
h6AkvAj_hao,15919005,15924195,"MARISHA: No, I mean, it's yours. I'm just--  ASHLEY: That way you can  come into the party. MARISHA: Sneaking it in my hair."
h6AkvAj_hao,15924195,15930084,"TRAVIS: Oh! Oh, shit. I didn't even pick up on it.  MARISHA: If shit goes down, I can be like,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15930084,15936655,"ah, Chetney, go. TRAVIS: My walls are high.  That's a winner.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,15936655,15941893,"ASHLEY: I happen to know court dances as well.  SAM: Ooh!  ASHLEY: So, should we need to--"
h6AkvAj_hao,15943295,15948675,"SAM: You could lead?  ASHLEY: We could do some dancing and fool them that, you know,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15950295,15956905,"we're supposed to be here.  ROBBIE: That's a good idea.  Dancing, a promenade, lots of hand touching."
h6AkvAj_hao,15956905,15963136,"LAURA: Oh, yeah. ROBBIE: Perhaps?  ASHLEY: Mm-hmm. All of that.  (laughter)"
h6AkvAj_hao,15963136,15969409,"ASHLEY: See, it's perfect.  ROBBIE: F.C.G. has legs now.  (laughter)  ROBBIE: He's learning it. ASHLEY: Look at you dancing."
h6AkvAj_hao,15971122,15977295,"TALIESIN: I'm going to need so much to drink for this.  LIAM: Maybe we start the ring off with you,"
h6AkvAj_hao,15978205,15984015,"and if things go sour, then we just improvise.  MARISHA: That's what I think as well.  ROBBIE: All right."
h6AkvAj_hao,15984015,15990694,"MARISHA: I think like a good old fashion,  ""Ooh, your ring looks nice. Can I see it?""  And see what happens. LIAM: Tap you off, ba-ba-bum."
h6AkvAj_hao,15990695,15996151,MARISHA: Mm-hmm.  ROBBIE: Just steal it. LAURA: And just take it  right off his hand? ROBBIE: Just take it  right off his finger.  MARISHA: How's your sleight of hand?
h6AkvAj_hao,15996151,16001965,"ROBBIE: It's very good.  SAM: I'll give you a little boost, too.  MARISHA: Here, practice.  ROBBIE: Practice? MARISHA: Yes."
h6AkvAj_hao,16001965,16007022,"ROBBIE: All right. On your-- Okay.  Oh, it's--  MARISHA: Let me pop my finger back."
h6AkvAj_hao,16007023,16013595,"LAURA: Yeah. (laughs)  MARISHA: Yeah, pop my finger back in place. It's fine.  TRAVIS: Slough.  MARISHA: Oh, you want to see my ring?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16013595,16018865,"Well, yes, it is made of the finest platinum.  I'm very rich. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
h6AkvAj_hao,16018865,16027218,"ROBBIE: Oh, it looks so lovely.  You can have it back.  MARISHA: Oh, thank you. LAURA: Oh!  MARISHA: Wow, it looks exactly like the one I gave you."
h6AkvAj_hao,16028165,16035326,"LAURA: See? That's pretty good.  TALIESIN: Oh my god, yeah.  ASHLEY: I didn't even see it.  LAURA: Now, what if he doesn't want to take it off his thumb?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16035326,16042585,SAM: We'll figure it out.  TALIESIN: Then we knock him out.  (laughter)  LAURA: Yeah.  ASHLEY: What would make you take a ring off?
h6AkvAj_hao,16042585,16048897,"SAM: Hm, bee sting.  TRAVIS: To appraise it.  To give it value, to get it cleaned.  TALIESIN: Proposal. TRAVIS: To..."
h6AkvAj_hao,16048897,16053925,ROBBIE: I haven't met many dwarves. Are they proud?  Do they have that  sort of vibe? LAURA: I think everyone's
h6AkvAj_hao,16053925,16061215,"their own person.  I don't think dwarves-- ASHLEY: But he seems to be,  with the jewelry he wears. ROBBIE: It was a generalization.  I was just saying-- I mean I just--"
h6AkvAj_hao,16061215,16066218,"I haven't met any.  That might be naive of me, but I'm sorry."
h6AkvAj_hao,16067225,16072555,"All right.  (laughter)  LIAM: We know what our first play is, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16072555,16078445,"There are multiple plans that we can pivot to.  Alcohol is very important for lubrication,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16078445,16085975,"but there's flirtation.  LAURA: There's flirtation.  Dater troupe, drama club."
h6AkvAj_hao,16085975,16091675,"MARISHA: Do we know what he's into?  LAURA: No.  MARISHA: What type of person he likes?  LAURA: Do you know, Eshteross? TALIESIN: We may find out."
h6AkvAj_hao,16091675,16097795,"LAURA: Because you, oh, we're not with him anymore.  TALIESIN: No, we're here.  LAURA: But he did say-- TALIESIN: No.  LAURA: No, but he did say-- I asked if he was married"
h6AkvAj_hao,16097795,16103225,"and he said he didn't have a partner, so I don't know.  ASHLEY: Well, we can ask that in the carriage tomorrow,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16103225,16108711,"just to prep.  TALIESIN: If someone starts making progress,  they keep at it."
h6AkvAj_hao,16108711,16114705,"ASHLEY: Sure. That's a good plan.  TALIESIN: Right.  There's no way to know till you know.  LIAM: If jewelry comparison doesn't go down,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16114705,16121395,"and Dorian and Fearne both lay it on thick  and you listen in, right?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16121395,16127385,"You can probably tip them off as to who should go in  for the kill.  ROBBIE: Yeah, we've got a lot of flavors here."
h6AkvAj_hao,16127385,16132525,"Surely, someone's taste.  ASHLEY: Yeah, we've got something for everyone.  That's true."
h6AkvAj_hao,16132526,16138655,"Then you could say like, ""Hey, back off, it's not you.""  LAURA: Mm-hmm.  ASHLEY: We should send in Chetney."
h6AkvAj_hao,16138655,16145042,"LAURA: Yeah, he's really into little, wirey--  LIAM: Muscle-y--  ASHLEY: Little men. TRAVIS: I'm basically the ace.  LIAM: Ropey."
h6AkvAj_hao,16147033,16153099,"LAURA: (laughs) Ropey.  SAM: We do have something  for everybody. LIAM: It's like Popeye.  TRAVIS: I'll just tell him to keep twirling me,  when that hand's working-- LAURA: Because you've got"
h6AkvAj_hao,16153099,16157556,"the attachments, right?  SAM: I haven't. I don't have. I can make a quick attachment."
h6AkvAj_hao,16159013,16164284,It might be a little rusty. (laughs)  ROBBIE: What about your ziggurat?  You could always get out your ziggurat.
h6AkvAj_hao,16164284,16170236,(laughter)  MATT: Oh my god.  ASHLEY: Maybe we should be The Grab Bags.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,16170236,16175376,"LAURA: I like it.  ASHLEY: Just, lots of things.  ROBBIE: We'll make it work."
h6AkvAj_hao,16175376,16181694,SAM: Yeah.  But we'll also know when we get there.  ROBBIE: Sure.  MARISHA: Should we have a group name for this?
h6AkvAj_hao,16181695,16186774,LAURA: Are we going to be announced as ourselves though?  SAM: No. LIAM: In two groups.  LAURA: We need a fake name.
h6AkvAj_hao,16186775,16192692,"ASHLEY: Oh, in two groups.  MARISHA: Do we need two separate names?  LAURA: Well, I assume one will be with Eshteross."
h6AkvAj_hao,16192692,16198755,"SAM: Lord Eshteross and his friends?  ROBBIE: Well, we truly could use this as our focus group."
h6AkvAj_hao,16198755,16205675,"One name-- LAURA: That's true.  ROBBIE: -- as a second choice. Next name, first choice.  Announce them both and see which gets the bigger applause.  TRAVIS: Yeah, the focus group's really delicate,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16205675,16211814,"and the second group goes and raises hell.  LAURA: Yeah.  ROBBIE: Two names, then. Let's come up with two instead of one."
h6AkvAj_hao,16211815,16217168,Much easier. SAM: Focus Groups?  LAURA: Raises Hell.  ROBBIE: Raises Hell.
h6AkvAj_hao,16218159,16223901,LAURA and MARISHA: Bell's Hells.  ASHLEY: Bell's Hells is--  SAM: It's pretty good. ASHLEY: -- pretty damn good.  TALIESIN: All right. SAM: It's pretty good.
h6AkvAj_hao,16223902,16230456,"TRAVIS: Bells?  LAURA: Yeah, the Bells.  The Belles of the Ball.  MARISHA: (gasps) TRAVIS and SAM: Ooh."
h6AkvAj_hao,16230456,16237673,"LAURA and ROBBIE: Bell's Hells.  TALIESIN: Bell's Hells. LAURA: Yeah.  ROBBIE: What was the one we bailed on  a little bit? MARISHA: Focus Group.  LAURA: Oh, the New Nobodies?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16237673,16245063,"ROBBIE: Is that out?  TALIESIN: I'll honestly say, it's entirely possible  somebody in that room might actually have had--  MARISHA: Okay, so not the New Nobodies."
h6AkvAj_hao,16245063,16250345,"TALIESIN: We did used to rob people in this town.  MARISHA: The Grab Bags, the Grab Bag Hags?"
h6AkvAj_hao,16250345,16256504,LIAM: The Nighty Mein.  MARISHA: The Mighty Neins? LIAM: Nighty Mein.  MARISHA: The Nighty Mein? ROBBIE: Nighty Mein.
h6AkvAj_hao,16257945,16263329,MARISHA: The Mighty Mimes.  SAM: The B&E. LAURA: The B&E.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,16263329,16270175,ROBBIE: I feel like there was another good one.  SAM: We'll be fine. We'll be fine.  We don't even know if we need a group name.
h6AkvAj_hao,16270175,16275639,"MATT: You got time to think on that.  SAM: Okay, it's done.  LAURA: We say every single--"
h6AkvAj_hao,16275639,16281788,MATT: Indeed.  LIAM: Fresh Cut and the Pussycats.  (considering noises)  MARISHA: Lord Eshteross and the Dave Matthews Band.
h6AkvAj_hao,16281788,16288479,(laughter)  TRAVIS: No.  SAM: ♪ All the little ants ♪
h6AkvAj_hao,16288479,16295251,♪ are marching ♪ MATT: I hate this.  TRAVIS: Dave Matthews Band and Adam Sandler.  (laughter)
h6AkvAj_hao,16295251,16301118,"TALIESIN: We're a little loopy, what can we say?  MATT: I know, I know.  LIAM: And now, the dancing shall begin.  ♪ (""Ants Go Marching"") ♪"
h6AkvAj_hao,16301118,16306168,"(laughter) TRAVIS: No!  MATT: All right, new campaign."
h6AkvAj_hao,16306168,16311455,"(laughter)  LIAM: Tarrasque. MARISHA: Burn it down.  TRAVIS: Wipe it. MARISHA: Trash it.  TALIESIN: This is how you get a TPK, guys."
h6AkvAj_hao,16311455,16316944,"MATT: Indeed.  So, plans for the most part set,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16316945,16322465,"paths decided,  goals considered,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16322465,16328558,"and possibilities laid out.  SAM: Ants marching.  MATT: Ants marching. I hate you so much, Sam."
h6AkvAj_hao,16328558,16334915,(laughter)  MATT: Damn it.
h6AkvAj_hao,16334915,16343395,"You rest for the night,  and the next day finish your final preparations,  before you reconvene at the abode of Lord Eshteross"
h6AkvAj_hao,16343395,16353000,"to get dressed, made up, masks at the ready,  approvals confirmed for your troops' arrival."
h6AkvAj_hao,16354525,16360694,Until slowly you hear the sounds of sillgoats gathering--  LAURA: Oh gosh. MATT: -- on the exterior.  Just as the sun begins
h6AkvAj_hao,16360695,16370418,"to slowly lower in the skies.  The oranges and purples begin to brighten,  leading into the later ports of the day, into the night."
h6AkvAj_hao,16371935,16379219,"The carriages await you outside.  Beautiful dark woods,  gilded in golds and dark greens on one,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16379219,16386305,the other hitting maroons and browns  with bright bronze and silver accents on it.
h6AkvAj_hao,16386385,16392250,"Each with four sillgoats to the front,  situated and clomping their way before they stop,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16392250,16397795,"and (goats neighing),  and getting ready with their creepy-ass,  fucking square eyes."
h6AkvAj_hao,16397795,16403070,ASHLEY: I go over and  I Taylor Swift scream goat at it.  Like a--
h6AkvAj_hao,16403072,16412469,MATT: It screams right back at you.  ASHLEY and MATT: (yell)  MATT: Nuzzles you. (goat bleating)
h6AkvAj_hao,16414705,16420902,"Your characters are arranged, your troupes divided.  As the doors are closed by the assistants,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16420902,16427584,"(cracking reins, clopping hooves)  begins riding up around to the spirals streets  of the Core Spire towards the top."
h6AkvAj_hao,16427586,16434891,"LAURA: I'm so glad Eshteross hired a makeup artist.  MARISHA: Me, too.  (laughter)  Need a lot of foundation for this, a lot."
h6AkvAj_hao,16434891,16441035,"MATT: Up, up.  Arriving on the climbing streets"
h6AkvAj_hao,16441035,16448064,"at the apex of the spire,  passing the Mirror Towers,  which currently are under heavy guard and investigation."
h6AkvAj_hao,16448064,16456625,"You all just hold your breath,  glancing over through the window of the carriage  to see the chaos that you missed before,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16456625,16462846,where the previous tower no longer stands.  The roadways shift from the standard dark gray
h6AkvAj_hao,16462846,16468258,"and brown stone, into an alabaster white,  until eventually,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16468258,16473994,"it reveals the sprawling gardens and trees  surrounding an incredible, wide, dome-like structure"
h6AkvAj_hao,16473994,16481006,"of colored glass,  that is enveloped by a spread of buildings  and halls that wrap around the edges of the spire top"
h6AkvAj_hao,16481006,16486414,like a lasso.  The windows overlooking the Oderan jungle
h6AkvAj_hao,16486414,16491705,and surrounding city below.  Small towers and elevated walkways connect
h6AkvAj_hao,16491705,16497936,"to the dome citadel in an elegant tangle.  The warm radiance of interior light giving it a glow,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16497936,16503258,almost impressive were it not for the Prakash Pyre  burning so brightly in the distance
h6AkvAj_hao,16503258,16508855,"from the Lantern Spire.  Numerous other carriages are before you,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16508855,16514885,"both pulled by beasts or arcana,  circling in the arrival road ahead."
h6AkvAj_hao,16514885,16520004,"Individuals you see emerging from the carriages,  gathering and walking towards the entrance,"
h6AkvAj_hao,16520006,16528482,the incredible 20-foot gold arch  that welcomes the invitees within.
h6AkvAj_hao,16529654,16536512,"As you take in the sights, the brimming anxiety,  the butterflies, and worry"
