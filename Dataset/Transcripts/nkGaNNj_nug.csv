nkGaNNj_nug,1280,3600,well russia now says it's preparing
nkGaNNj_nug,3600,6240,measures to punish lithuania which has
nkGaNNj_nug,6240,8400,blocked the transit of some goods
nkGaNNj_nug,8400,10960,subject to eu sanctions from reaching
nkGaNNj_nug,10960,14400,the russian territory of kaliningrad now
nkGaNNj_nug,14400,16160,the interesting thing about kaliningrad
nkGaNNj_nug,16160,18640,as we can see here in red it shares no
nkGaNNj_nug,18640,21119,land border with russia
nkGaNNj_nug,21119,23519,and is surrounded in fact by eu
nkGaNNj_nug,23519,25840,countries so it means that russia relies
nkGaNNj_nug,25840,28560,heavily on rail transit through
nkGaNNj_nug,28560,31840,lithuania to get to kaliningrad and
nkGaNNj_nug,31840,34239,moscow has said that any action it takes
nkGaNNj_nug,34239,36480,against lithuania which let's not forget
nkGaNNj_nug,36480,38079,is a nato member
nkGaNNj_nug,38079,41360,would not be solely diplomatic
nkGaNNj_nug,41360,43280,our russia editor steve rosenberg sent
nkGaNNj_nug,43280,45840,this report
nkGaNNj_nug,46160,48800,it is a piece of russia in the heart of
nkGaNNj_nug,48800,49840,europe
nkGaNNj_nug,49840,53280,kaliningrad is 300 miles from mainland
nkGaNNj_nug,53280,54320,russia
nkGaNNj_nug,54320,56000,russia's outpost
nkGaNNj_nug,56000,57520,and fortress
nkGaNNj_nug,57520,61680,this is the home of the baltic fleet
nkGaNNj_nug,61840,64478,for supplies it's relied on rail links
nkGaNNj_nug,64478,66159,through lithuania
nkGaNNj_nug,66159,69200,but because of eu sanctions the transit
nkGaNNj_nug,69200,73039,of key russian goods is
nkGaNNj_nug,79759,82320,it's barely operating as it is
nkGaNNj_nug,82320,84080,and with russian cement now on the
nkGaNNj_nug,84080,86720,sanctions list that's another blow to
nkGaNNj_nug,86720,89280,his business
nkGaNNj_nug,89759,91759,the sanctions won't only affect our
nkGaNNj_nug,91759,92720,business
nkGaNNj_nug,92720,94720,they'll affect everyone
nkGaNNj_nug,94720,97040,our factory is at a standstill
nkGaNNj_nug,97040,98640,we aren't making anything so the
nkGaNNj_nug,98640,100960,builders can't build anything there's a
nkGaNNj_nug,100960,103759,chain reaction
nkGaNNj_nug,103840,106560,lithuania insists it has not blockaded
nkGaNNj_nug,106560,108960,kaliningrad russian passengers can
nkGaNNj_nug,108960,111360,transit freely through lithuania to get
nkGaNNj_nug,111360,113600,here and so can russian goods that are
nkGaNNj_nug,113600,116000,not on the eu sanctions list
nkGaNNj_nug,116000,118079,that hasn't silenced the chorus of
nkGaNNj_nug,118079,120560,criticism from russian officials
nkGaNNj_nug,120560,123758,or the saber rattling
nkGaNNj_nug,124399,126640,this week the hawkish head of russia's
nkGaNNj_nug,126640,129520,security council flew to kaliningrad
nkGaNNj_nug,129520,132319,nikolai patricia attacked the west and
nkGaNNj_nug,132319,134800,denounced the transit ban as a hostile
nkGaNNj_nug,134800,137360,act he warned of serious negative
nkGaNNj_nug,137360,142239,consequences for the lithuanian people
nkGaNNj_nug,142239,145360,today his boss president putin marked
nkGaNNj_nug,145360,147840,the anniversary of the nazi invasion of
nkGaNNj_nug,147840,149680,the soviet union
nkGaNNj_nug,149680,151920,the kremlin leader has yet to announce
nkGaNNj_nug,151920,154000,his response to the ban
nkGaNNj_nug,154000,156640,the message from america don't even
nkGaNNj_nug,156640,159360,think of involving the russian army
nkGaNNj_nug,159360,161360,our commitment to
nkGaNNj_nug,161360,163840,nato and uh specifically our commitment
nkGaNNj_nug,163840,166319,to nato's article five uh the premise
nkGaNNj_nug,166319,168480,that an attack on one would constitute
nkGaNNj_nug,168480,170480,an attack on all
nkGaNNj_nug,170480,171920,that commitment on the part of the
nkGaNNj_nug,171920,174959,united states is ironclad
nkGaNNj_nug,174959,177760,and what does fisherman sergey think
nkGaNNj_nug,177760,179760,well like many of the people i spoke to
nkGaNNj_nug,179760,181680,in kaliningrad he doesn't blame
nkGaNNj_nug,181680,185040,lithuania or the
nkGaNNj_nug,187680,189920,make them better sergey says
nkGaNNj_nug,189920,192159,i want peace and friendship with all
nkGaNNj_nug,192159,194080,countries
nkGaNNj_nug,194080,198239,cooperation instead of confrontation
nkGaNNj_nug,198239,201200,that is not the kremlin line
