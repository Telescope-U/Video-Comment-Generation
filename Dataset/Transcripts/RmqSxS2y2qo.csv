RmqSxS2y2qo,402639,404639,thanks for leaving this comment i've
RmqSxS2y2qo,404639,407199,already explained this at least 50 times
RmqSxS2y2qo,407199,409919,but here we go again dad i always start
RmqSxS2y2qo,409919,412560,all of my sketches in my sketchbook
RmqSxS2y2qo,412560,414319,here's a clicker i'm working on for
RmqSxS2y2qo,414319,416560,example then i'll input it into
RmqSxS2y2qo,416560,419199,procreate make it all perfect then i'm
RmqSxS2y2qo,419199,421199,left with this
RmqSxS2y2qo,421199,423440,and then i print out a stencil then i
RmqSxS2y2qo,423440,424720,cut it out
RmqSxS2y2qo,424720,426720,tape it to the back of my paper like
RmqSxS2y2qo,426720,429440,that and use this as a light box i just
RmqSxS2y2qo,429440,431039,taped a lamp to the bottom of my desk
RmqSxS2y2qo,431039,432960,and then i go to town dude it's my
RmqSxS2y2qo,432960,435440,original art but i do this because all
RmqSxS2y2qo,435440,437440,the sketching and erasing on the paper
RmqSxS2y2qo,437440,439759,ruins it and affects the way that the
RmqSxS2y2qo,439759,442240,markers and pens are absorbed i'm super
RmqSxS2y2qo,442240,444720,indecisive so this helps me out a lot
RmqSxS2y2qo,444720,446960,this way it can look more clean and
RmqSxS2y2qo,446960,449280,professional dude illustrators around
RmqSxS2y2qo,449280,451759,the world thousands of people do this
RmqSxS2y2qo,451759,454960,technique man i'm not the only one okay
RmqSxS2y2qo,454960,456560,let's try something with a little more
RmqSxS2y2qo,456560,458160,3d context
RmqSxS2y2qo,458160,460240,i'm making my basic envelope shape and
RmqSxS2y2qo,460240,462319,above it i'm drawing a compass this is
RmqSxS2y2qo,462319,463520,going to help me determine the
RmqSxS2y2qo,463520,465360,directions of the strokes i'm going to
RmqSxS2y2qo,465360,468000,use starting with north i'm aiming to
RmqSxS2y2qo,468000,470639,funnel my strokes upward to reinforce
RmqSxS2y2qo,470639,472160,the impression that this part of the
RmqSxS2y2qo,472160,474720,cloth is standing up and now i recognize
RmqSxS2y2qo,474720,476479,there's a slope to how the cloth is
RmqSxS2y2qo,476479,479039,upheld i'm changing the angle of my
RmqSxS2y2qo,479039,481840,sketching to again reinforce this
RmqSxS2y2qo,481840,483199,impression
RmqSxS2y2qo,483199,484800,when i was in art school at the final
RmqSxS2y2qo,484800,486479,crit a student put up a drawing of
RmqSxS2y2qo,486479,488879,knitted mittens on the wall
RmqSxS2y2qo,488879,490639,the teacher was offended and said it was
RmqSxS2y2qo,490639,492319,clear how much the student did not take
RmqSxS2y2qo,492319,494000,the assignment seriously
RmqSxS2y2qo,494000,496160,nor their art career
RmqSxS2y2qo,496160,497360,and then the students said one of the
RmqSxS2y2qo,497360,499840,most badass things i've ever heard
RmqSxS2y2qo,499840,502000,they went on to say you know
RmqSxS2y2qo,502000,503759,i've spent the last four years trying to
RmqSxS2y2qo,503759,506319,figure out if i'm an artist and now i
RmqSxS2y2qo,506319,508560,realize that i'm not
RmqSxS2y2qo,508560,510160,i love knitting
RmqSxS2y2qo,510160,511520,it's my passion
RmqSxS2y2qo,511520,513279,it's all i want to do
RmqSxS2y2qo,513279,515120,so the only thing i could care to draw
RmqSxS2y2qo,515120,516159,was this
RmqSxS2y2qo,516159,518080,so that's all i got
RmqSxS2y2qo,518080,520240,this was over 10 years ago and i still
RmqSxS2y2qo,520240,522479,remember how powerful it was to be in
RmqSxS2y2qo,522479,524399,the presence of someone who truly knew
RmqSxS2y2qo,524399,526399,themselves and refused to pretend
RmqSxS2y2qo,526399,527600,otherwise
RmqSxS2y2qo,527600,530320,so i raise my mittens to you all
RmqSxS2y2qo,530320,532160,that you find along your path the thing
RmqSxS2y2qo,532160,534480,that you are so passionate about that
RmqSxS2y2qo,534480,535839,everything else
RmqSxS2y2qo,535839,539399,doesn't really matter
