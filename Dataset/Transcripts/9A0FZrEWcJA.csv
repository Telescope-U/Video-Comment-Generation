9A0FZrEWcJA,8960,17520,hello everybody my name is luke maher  and this is hotline mode and today on  hollywood we are coming to you with  we're may 2022 fashion roast and review
9A0FZrEWcJA,17520,23600,there's a lot to discuss but before we  actually get into it let's just say if  you are a channel member check out the
9A0FZrEWcJA,23600,30080,channel member version and if you're not  you should become one because then  you're going to see the full 50 looks  that we're going to be discussing but if
9A0FZrEWcJA,30080,36559,you're not there's still a grand amount  of content so don't worry i also should  say listen to the subscribe button like
9A0FZrEWcJA,36559,42719,this video share with your friends i  don't know follow on tick tock instagram  twitter wherever call them up but
9A0FZrEWcJA,42719,48800,without further ado let's just get right  into it first up we have addison ray and  she's wearing rick owens and listen this
9A0FZrEWcJA,48800,55280,is the thing i will say about addison  ray when she is bad she is also bad but  when she is good
9A0FZrEWcJA,55280,60960,it's  good so she's doing a honestly pretty
9A0FZrEWcJA,60960,68159,girl version of rick owens it's a very  sort of neoclassical  draped gathered textured asymmetrical
9A0FZrEWcJA,68159,75680,sort of goddess dress and nice light  sort of slate gray very rick owens  minimal but at the same time texturized
9A0FZrEWcJA,75680,82880,looks like it fits well and it also is  very pretty very sleek very elegant the  composition of the photograph is also
9A0FZrEWcJA,82880,88159,like nice and it looks good and then on  top of it i think the heels are like the  best part they're beautiful sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,88159,93439,sandals but they're in that kiss boot  sort of style so they have the lucite  heel and they have the big sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,93439,98880,platform but we can obviously see  through and like see foot they have an  open toe so in my opinion it's like
9A0FZrEWcJA,98880,104640,taking the kiss boot and sort of making  it again very greek goddess neoclassical
9A0FZrEWcJA,104640,111200,sort of vibe it's very chic it's very  fun i think it's very summery and  festive but at the same time very
9A0FZrEWcJA,111200,116799,refined very rick owens avant-garde  minimal sort of you know fashion forward
9A0FZrEWcJA,116799,123520,but at the same time like not too  fashion forward for addison ray to  handle so i'm the first one to rip this
9A0FZrEWcJA,123520,130479,woman up no problem but when it's good  i'll say it's good and i think this is  very good i like this for addison let's
9A0FZrEWcJA,130479,135520,keep it going next up we have alexa demi  and she was at balenciaga's resort 2023
9A0FZrEWcJA,135520,142319,show she is wearing a version of a look  i believe from fall 2022 ready to wear i
9A0FZrEWcJA,142319,147520,couldn't find the runway version that  was black there might be one but i found  the blue version essentially it's an
9A0FZrEWcJA,147520,152800,asymmetrical pelvic area of a jean  exposes the shoulders doesn't have
9A0FZrEWcJA,152800,159360,sleeves but at the same time it has  pockets it looks like the top part of  jeans and then we can see that it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,159360,166800,tucked into a pair of big baggy jeans or  maybe it has a big belt it's very demna
9A0FZrEWcJA,166800,173280,georgian  now the look in and of itself like do we  think it's bad yeah there's this whole  like trend of we're gonna turn jeans
9A0FZrEWcJA,173280,179920,into anything bags and tops and more  pants and skirts and dresses and coffin
9A0FZrEWcJA,179920,185599,liners but they will turn jeans into  anything at this point we have to stop  the madness because it's not that chic
9A0FZrEWcJA,185599,191920,it's not that elegant it's a little bit  dare i say  ugly and listen i'm not one to be like
9A0FZrEWcJA,191920,197680,this is ridiculous fashion is dead oh  this is too crazy like it it's not too
9A0FZrEWcJA,197680,203840,crazy it just also is just not  attractive you know what i mean like i  appreciate that we did something crazy
9A0FZrEWcJA,203840,210720,and kooky and weird but also at a  certain point it gets a bit too  floridian for me alexa demi i appreciate
9A0FZrEWcJA,210720,216080,it thank you blensiaga appreciate it  thank you maybe let's move on to
9A0FZrEWcJA,216080,223040,something a little bit different please  because everybody else is doing it let's  push it along next up we have ariana  grande she is wearing
9A0FZrEWcJA,223040,229440,custom vera wang now she wore this to  her brother's wedding  it's very simple but listen it's a bra
9A0FZrEWcJA,229440,234480,top with an intriguing cup because it  looks like they're almost reaching  around but it has straps on it so
9A0FZrEWcJA,234480,239599,they're not actually like reaching  around in that sort of way but it's not  like a bandeau where it connects all the
9A0FZrEWcJA,239599,246000,way and then it's pretty much this  high-waisted skirt with a little slit  that has been gathered to a degree not
9A0FZrEWcJA,246000,252400,really crazy but also like she's going  to a wedding so i mean are you trying to  be like crazy you're trying to like  upstage frankie grande i don't know if
9A0FZrEWcJA,252400,258720,that's possible i don't think it is but  like still i i understand so it's not  one of the craziest ariana grande looks
9A0FZrEWcJA,258720,265360,that i've ever seen and i'm willing to  like give her  a little bit of a pass because of the  context and also because she's put in
9A0FZrEWcJA,265360,271199,work i appreciate it we've seen the  fashion blow up it's been glowing so  we'll let it rock next up we've
9A0FZrEWcJA,271199,276320,brettmann rock he is wearing fendi as  well it's pretty much just a
9A0FZrEWcJA,276320,282320,logo blazer there is the fendi logo  choker and a bag presume that it's part
9A0FZrEWcJA,282320,287520,of the fandachae collection which is the  versace vendi collection i'm not sure  though it could be it could not be it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,287520,292560,a little bit tame for bretman a little  two-team for bratman for me i'm not  saying that we can't have her moments
9A0FZrEWcJA,292560,299680,but i want like a little bit more  exciting than fendi logo but i can't  totally blame bretman defendache if
9A0FZrEWcJA,299680,305360,that's what this is next that we're  going to talk about chloe 70 there's a  lot of chloe 70 to discuss she got
9A0FZrEWcJA,305360,310560,married so let's talk about the dress  that she chose and you know me i'm very
9A0FZrEWcJA,310560,316639,like pro everybody enjoying their  wedding and like not to speak ill of  anybody's wedding although when we get
9A0FZrEWcJA,316639,321680,to the kardashians section all of those  bets are off but the great thing about  chloe 70 is like she has phenomenal
9A0FZrEWcJA,321680,327039,taste in general so she pulled out a  jean-paul gautier oat couture look by
9A0FZrEWcJA,327039,333360,glenn martens for his collection that he  designed it's  a stunner it's a gorgeous look it's a
9A0FZrEWcJA,333360,340320,white beautiful chiffon dress that  essentially creates bonus with like a  chevron sort of style where we can see
9A0FZrEWcJA,340320,346400,the white sort of chiffon like frothing  out but we can see the sheerness of the  dress we can see chloe's skin underneath
9A0FZrEWcJA,346400,353120,does a really really beautiful job it  sort of nips in the waist and then the  skirt sort of falls out vertically with  these same sort of like big i want to
9A0FZrEWcJA,353120,358639,call them like tubes of chiffon that  sort of fall down the front of the dress  and there's a frothy little shoulder
9A0FZrEWcJA,358639,365120,it's really like it's a beautiful dress  it's very cool it's very unconventional  it's very glenn martin's does weddings
9A0FZrEWcJA,365120,372080,for the old couture women it's just a  really intriguing beautiful dress and  i'm grateful to be able to see it and it
9A0FZrEWcJA,372080,379680,seems like there is some sort of lace  that goes underneath at least on the  skirt we can see there's some sort of  little motif going on under there i just
9A0FZrEWcJA,379680,385520,am like in awe that chloe 70 has such a  fantastic taste at all times you know
9A0FZrEWcJA,385520,391919,what i mean like people talk about  having taste and style and it's like  natural and all this is like one of the
9A0FZrEWcJA,391919,397199,moments where's like yes thank you  appreciate love to see ya congrats to
9A0FZrEWcJA,397199,402319,her and the husband whatever his name is  next up we have christine chu from bling
9A0FZrEWcJA,402319,407600,empire and she is wearing balenciaga she  attended the resort 2023 show as well
9A0FZrEWcJA,407600,412960,what she is wearing is a denim jacket  that is worn off the shoulders in my
9A0FZrEWcJA,412960,420160,opinion a stunning gorgeous iconic  wonderful reference to denma's first  balenciaga women's wear show where those
9A0FZrEWcJA,420160,427360,beautiful coats were off the shoulders  very balenciaga esque in terms of  reference every like that's
9A0FZrEWcJA,427360,433840,still to me like such a standout  collection that like will go down in  history in my opinion so it's nice to
9A0FZrEWcJA,433840,440000,see that like little reference here it's  not as  what i would say altered as the original
9A0FZrEWcJA,440000,445680,versions were because i know the  original version sort of flare out at  the bottom because there's a stitch in  there that sort of makes them flare up
9A0FZrEWcJA,445680,451680,but this one is just it's a nice like  fun little reference i think to gemina's  very very very first valencia women's
9A0FZrEWcJA,451680,457440,wear collection love to see it and then  with this long floor-length skirt in a  what looks like a taffeta sort of silk
9A0FZrEWcJA,457440,463919,very balenciaga i would say christine  chu is a she's an old couture client  we'll react to that video if you guys
9A0FZrEWcJA,463919,471840,want and  to me it reads very christine it reads  very balenciaga  alademna do i like love them together no
9A0FZrEWcJA,471840,478800,but do i think it makes sense  for the context of blenciago like  currently yeah would i put it together
9A0FZrEWcJA,478800,484479,no do i understand yeah and that's half  the battle nowadays just understanding  it you know what i mean like if you
9A0FZrEWcJA,484479,490080,understand that that's great you don't  have to love it then next we have  christine quinn she is wearing
9A0FZrEWcJA,490080,496879,balenciaga a little gathered dress it  looks like a wrap dress i'm thinking  that it's actually a panel that flows
9A0FZrEWcJA,496879,503520,over top and then it's a panty sort of  shoe or it's some sort of jumpsuit  because it's all black we can see that  there is most definitely like a panty
9A0FZrEWcJA,503520,510000,shoe  very damn balenciaga all throughout  there and then what we can see is the  gathering in the front falls over it
9A0FZrEWcJA,510000,515360,feels almost like those shirts that  demna did or maybe it was women's wear  where it was like the two shirts sewn on
9A0FZrEWcJA,515360,520719,top of each other so it has that kind of  feeling to it to me and then that bag  which i think obviously blends out is
9A0FZrEWcJA,520719,526720,like now pushing very hard it's the new  sort of bag of the year i don't hate it  i wish christine was a little bit
9A0FZrEWcJA,526720,532399,smarter about what she wears i know  everybody's like christine  and it's like yeah yeah great tv blah
9A0FZrEWcJA,532399,537519,blah that's not why we're here to talk  about that i don't think christine  has taste
9A0FZrEWcJA,537519,545200,to back up everything else and i say  that because it's just always like a  batman 1980s like sharp shoulder blazer
9A0FZrEWcJA,545200,550720,and a skinny pant or like a dress that's  fitted and that's my issue with  christine so like this to me i feel like
9A0FZrEWcJA,550720,556480,we should have pushed her something a  little bit more fashion forward so she's  becoming a balenciaga woman fine but
9A0FZrEWcJA,556480,561680,push outside of your usual shtick of is  it fashion or are you just skinny next
9A0FZrEWcJA,561680,566959,we have doja cat she is wearing  valentino on the cover of elle magazine
9A0FZrEWcJA,566959,573279,now it's a pink dress in that pure palo  pepy pink and it is a cut out style that
9A0FZrEWcJA,573279,579839,sort of showcases rest in the boob and  the hip and the side now it's also been  paired with tights that are bright pink
9A0FZrEWcJA,579839,584959,and sort of come up the hip area and i  presume matching shoes covering up which
9A0FZrEWcJA,584959,591279,i understand obviously we don't want to  be showing everything on the cover maybe  for i don't know  whatever reason it's not a bad it's not
9A0FZrEWcJA,591279,597360,it's really not a bad look for valentino  at all like i think it's one of the  intriguing looks of that collection and
9A0FZrEWcJA,597360,604320,it was one that like set itself apart  most definitely from a lot of the other  versions of this pink dress style
9A0FZrEWcJA,604320,610000,compared to however many looks there  were but it's just not  the best
9A0FZrEWcJA,610000,615200,way to showcase the stress if we're  covering up all of the cutouts and i  don't blame doger for that i feel like
9A0FZrEWcJA,615200,621200,it's more of an l editorial decision why  we did that i just wish that we hadn't  done that not because i'm like oh my god
9A0FZrEWcJA,621200,627920,don't you cat like show off your whole  body but more so cuz like why did we  pull a cut-out dress if we're gonna make  her cover herself somebody explain i am
9A0FZrEWcJA,627920,634560,confused it's a great dress i love the  bows on the side i think it's really fun  i just don't know why we  made her cover up the cut out dress you
9A0FZrEWcJA,634560,640720,know what i mean it's ironic nonsensical  some may say next we have dove cameron  and she is wearing valentino now this is
9A0FZrEWcJA,640720,646240,a look from the fall 2022 collection  it's also one of the looks that is part  of that pp pink collection but it's in
9A0FZrEWcJA,646240,651440,black because there was a little black  section in it i love this neckline i  think it's really really gorgeous  neckline i love the fit of this dress i
9A0FZrEWcJA,651440,656880,think it fits better here on dove than  it does on the runway or at least via  the photos it does the little bows on
9A0FZrEWcJA,656880,662640,the side are really really lovely i  think it's very nice little valentino  sort of tie in historically it's a house
9A0FZrEWcJA,662640,668240,code i just think it fits her  phenomenally and whoever her stylist is  is doing a really really good job never
9A0FZrEWcJA,668240,673600,did i ever think i would think about  dove cameron outside of the context of  descendants and like here we are it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,673600,681120,just it's a little fashion moment and  i'm really i'm proud and i'm happy and  she is doing the zendaya transition from
9A0FZrEWcJA,681120,687920,disney girl to fashion girl  very happy to see you next up we have  dualipa she's on the cover of vogue
9A0FZrEWcJA,687920,693360,listen people are gonna like say luke  talk about the cover i'm not a  photographer like my composition skills
9A0FZrEWcJA,693360,698640,are like not fantastic look at this  background so i don't really have  anything to say about like the  photographs but also it's like american
9A0FZrEWcJA,698640,705040,vogue if you were expecting something  exciting  that's a you problem no offense it's  just not
9A0FZrEWcJA,705040,710880,gonna be  major and or memorable no offense avadon  is dead i don't know who like needs to
9A0FZrEWcJA,710880,717040,tell everybody that but like he's he's  dead cecil beaton's gone helm and newton  also got they're all gone and vogue is
9A0FZrEWcJA,717040,721920,not hiring like the girls that shoot  well so
9A0FZrEWcJA,723360,729600,i don't know what we're expecting so  anyway let's talk about the look it's  essentially a white rib knit tank top
9A0FZrEWcJA,729600,734880,very ralph simmons thoma finland  homosexual and then it's a
9A0FZrEWcJA,734880,740880,light gray  rib  knit dress that is merged i don't know
9A0FZrEWcJA,740880,747760,how it's come together maybe it's just  layered with a fishnet dress with little  embroideries of florals sort of stem out
9A0FZrEWcJA,747760,755120,of it and then it has the prada triangle  logo which has become very very very  very very prada esque since raph simmons
9A0FZrEWcJA,755120,760800,has come  in so honestly i think the look in and  of itself is produced it's strange it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,760800,765920,weird it's layered it's nuanced i love  the gray
9A0FZrEWcJA,765920,771839,rib top and then i love the fact that we  have this beautiful little light fishnet  skirt but it's done with this little
9A0FZrEWcJA,771839,778639,dainty embroidery and yellow it's really  lovely i think it's very much so  ambiguous prada ism of trying to
9A0FZrEWcJA,778639,784720,modernize embroidery and doing  embroidery on a fishnet skirt in a way  that like nobody actually is
9A0FZrEWcJA,784720,789920,realistically gonna wear is amazing  super funny i think it's great and then  a little sort of black underwear
9A0FZrEWcJA,789920,795519,underneath overall listen i think it's  hilarious i think it's a good look i  think it's very much so fashion
9A0FZrEWcJA,795519,800959,in the sense of like it's not something  you're gonna see walking down the street  although if it did i wouldn't be
9A0FZrEWcJA,800959,806079,complaining i think it's intriguing you  think it's very dewy but i think it's  very sort of what she does which is
9A0FZrEWcJA,806079,811839,body  showcasing movement i'm not opposed to  this i think it's a nice look on her the
9A0FZrEWcJA,811839,819040,way that it's shot different  conversation next weevel fanning and  she's wearing gucci she was at the  resort 2023 show there is a crispy
9A0FZrEWcJA,819040,824800,metallic pink pant which honestly love  very chic very elegant very cute a  little black blazer a white button-down
9A0FZrEWcJA,824800,831600,shirt a patina leather tie which i see  you well i see you fashion girl i know a
9A0FZrEWcJA,831600,836959,little studded bag and a very metallicy  sort of shoe situation honestly like i
9A0FZrEWcJA,836959,843040,like this i don't i don't hate it i like  when elle does like the tailored sort of  gucci bob i feel like we've seen that  from her and i think this is like a fun
9A0FZrEWcJA,843040,848320,way of doing it it's still like pretty  in pink but it's a little bit harder in  that metallic weirdly enough i think the
9A0FZrEWcJA,848320,854720,utilization of black and white and more  of like a tailoring sort of scheme for  everything else is like pretty decent it  doesn't hurt the look i think it works
9A0FZrEWcJA,854720,860160,i'm shocked but i kind of love  this i don't know how i don't know why
9A0FZrEWcJA,860160,866160,but i do next up we have emma stone  she's wearing louis vuitton this is from  the fall 2022 collection it is an off
9A0FZrEWcJA,866160,872320,the shoulder gown with a panel of  pleated chiffon that sort of runs down
9A0FZrEWcJA,872320,879519,the front and has two little loops in  the front it's very nicolas scare weird  wacky deconstruction reconstruction i
9A0FZrEWcJA,879519,885680,don't know what's happening although on  the runway there was like a big sweater  tied over it so like maybe that's why  they tied the sweater over i don't know
9A0FZrEWcJA,885680,893839,and then there's a little red belt which  i feel like doesn't make any sense in  the context of like a pleated grecian  neoclassical sort of gown style whatever
9A0FZrEWcJA,893839,898959,the embroidery is it's very intriguing  overall like it's it's not attractive i
9A0FZrEWcJA,898959,904639,would say but it is intriguing and i i  appreciate that from louis vuitton i  think the two little panels that run
9A0FZrEWcJA,904639,910560,down the front is really cool and weird  i just think the rest of the dress does  a little bit maybe too much in certain
9A0FZrEWcJA,910560,916160,elements like the red bell  why i kind of wish she had worn the  sweater over it though and i mean like i
9A0FZrEWcJA,916160,921760,think that would have been fun again i  feel like we talked about this  with can like if you're gonna do it just
9A0FZrEWcJA,921760,927120,go for it you can't like especially with  louis vuitton you have to just go for it  you cannot pretty pretty princess unless
9A0FZrEWcJA,927120,933519,the dress is gonna be pretty pretty  princess and that you've had that  confirmed beforehand like if it's weird  and wacky and you know that you just do
9A0FZrEWcJA,933519,939920,that's it you just do that's all  that's it that's what you signed up for  that's why they pay yeah next up we have
9A0FZrEWcJA,939920,947240,finn wolfhard and he is wearing  sandleron as per usual essentially it's  a black blouse with a sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,947240,954320,fold-over button-up situation but the  fold-over allows for like a drape  there's also like a little bow
9A0FZrEWcJA,954320,960959,string that flies down very seminal gray  tailored pant and a black shoe
9A0FZrEWcJA,960959,967120,it's not great i just don't think it  makes a lot of sense listen i haven't  watched the fourth season a stranger  thing so like maybe it has something to
9A0FZrEWcJA,967120,972800,do with the character  even if it does it's a little too  demogorgon in terms of like doom and
9A0FZrEWcJA,972800,979199,gloom for me i appreciate what we're  going for with the shirt and trying to  be interesting and intriguing and has
9A0FZrEWcJA,979199,984320,like a little band shirt sort of feeling  to it but also we have like the little  strip that comes down and there's this
9A0FZrEWcJA,984320,989440,the fabric draping i love the idea of it  the execution of it is a little harder
9A0FZrEWcJA,989440,996000,to love with the pan it also just feels  a little too  boring it's not my favorite saint
9A0FZrEWcJA,996000,1002240,laurent on finn wolfhard by a long long  long long long long long long shot next
9A0FZrEWcJA,1002240,1009440,up we have gemma chan and she is at the  louis vuitton resort 2023 show she's  wearing a look from fall 2022
9A0FZrEWcJA,1009440,1014480,essentially it's a turtleneck with one  of those overall style dresses that has
9A0FZrEWcJA,1014480,1021440,the big sort of pocketed side panels  that sort of gives it this really  intriguing sort of trapezy shape it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1021440,1026959,also paired with like a little brown  boot i don't like completely hate it i
9A0FZrEWcJA,1026959,1034000,think because again gemma here is like  actually going for the weirdness of the  louis vuitton i mean like it is a  strange look the the idea of like a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1034000,1040400,fitted overall that falls out into like  big pocketed panels that also create a  sort of emphasis on the hip while
9A0FZrEWcJA,1040400,1047839,pairing that over top of like a  turtleneck with this  very intriguing sort of plaid degraded
9A0FZrEWcJA,1047839,1055120,motif and then the brown boot and the  bag with the red but it's just like it's  a lot but i also don't completely
9A0FZrEWcJA,1055120,1060880,despise it do i maybe wish the boots  were black yes besides that though it's  an intriguing look the silhouette is
9A0FZrEWcJA,1060880,1067120,interesting it's nice that it's done and  then knit she followed through on the  nicolas scare louis vuitton strangeness
9A0FZrEWcJA,1067120,1073360,so i'm gonna take this and be be happy  with it i will approve next up is harry  styles and he is wearing jw anderson now
9A0FZrEWcJA,1073360,1081440,i believe this is a custom jumpsuit it's  an asymmetrical  green brown and black stripe
9A0FZrEWcJA,1081440,1089039,with a little flared bell sleeve the  thing about it is it's weird jw anderson  that's fine i appreciate that i always
9A0FZrEWcJA,1089039,1096799,think it's fun and it's different and  it's strange i think the thing is the  fit of it is boxy i would say it just
9A0FZrEWcJA,1096799,1102320,doesn't feel like it actually fits to  harry's body whatsoever maybe that's  what we were going for but even then it
9A0FZrEWcJA,1102320,1108480,just looks a little bit too  sense but to me it looks a little too  like jelly baby that's what i say i feel
9A0FZrEWcJA,1108480,1114480,like i'm like teletubby meets british  childhood candy even though i know jelly  babies are not like striped at all it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1114480,1120400,hard to process it i understand i love  weird jw anderson let's not act like i
9A0FZrEWcJA,1120400,1126160,don't it's just i appreciate the fact  that we went for something weird and  strange and very hairy styles in that
9A0FZrEWcJA,1126160,1131520,regard it just doesn't do all that much  i just think the fit of it is a little
9A0FZrEWcJA,1131520,1137039,too too baggy it just looks like it  doesn't fit at like the crotch area i  feel like i can see an excess of fabric
9A0FZrEWcJA,1137039,1142080,a bit which i don't love i also wish a  little bell sleeve we just like matched
9A0FZrEWcJA,1142080,1148799,match the stripes it would have been  a little bit nicer and he just looks  like a key is meant to be entertaining
9A0FZrEWcJA,1148799,1154880,you know a four-year-old on baby shark  or cocoa melon it's just to the wiggles
9A0FZrEWcJA,1154880,1160240,for me and and it's hard to to love  wholeheartedly next we have henry
9A0FZrEWcJA,1160240,1165360,golding and he is wearing dior he was at  the resort menswear show or spring i'm
9A0FZrEWcJA,1165360,1172400,pretty positive that he's wearing off  the runway because i browsed your men  for quite some time and i could not find
9A0FZrEWcJA,1172400,1177679,the look except for on the most recent  collections runway it was just the pants  not the jacket but essentially this look
9A0FZrEWcJA,1177679,1184559,is made up of a dior oblique monogram in  some sort of what velvet with the little
9A0FZrEWcJA,1184559,1191120,dior threads running through so you can  see that it says dior there's a little  bunny on the up rest which to me is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1191120,1196160,reference like kim jones's whole love of  broaches and putting brooches on things  and
9A0FZrEWcJA,1196160,1201600,putting more brooches on things bunny  i'm sure has to do with like erl which  is eli
9A0FZrEWcJA,1201600,1207840,russell lynette's and his brand it's  there it exists the look isn't great
9A0FZrEWcJA,1207840,1213039,i'll say you know what i mean it's a  little bit blah it's just pretty much a  monogram look a little bunny patch a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1213039,1218080,white shirt and i'm sure dior monogram  sneakers i kind of want better for henry
9A0FZrEWcJA,1218080,1224320,listen i'm fine with him being out of  his like tom for era that's cool but i  think we need to like work a little bit
9A0FZrEWcJA,1224320,1229600,more on what the next direction is your  name in fashion wise the next era the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1229600,1236880,tailored suave  crazy rotation era that's fun love that  very gorge this one i'm not sure of we
9A0FZrEWcJA,1236880,1242159,gotta work on that a little bit more but  i feel like he's at your favorite  because if you're wearing stuff that's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1242159,1248960,gonna appear on the runway that usually  means  you're a brand favorite so i'm hoping we  can like work and finesse and finagle
9A0FZrEWcJA,1248960,1256000,something a little bit better in the  future but the look is not  next up we have jay balvin he is wearing  balenciaga he was at the resort 2023
9A0FZrEWcJA,1256000,1262320,show listen the t-shirt is great tupac  love to see it very early 2000s like emo
9A0FZrEWcJA,1262320,1269039,grungy  spencer's kind of vibe the jeans are  very jengko s but they're still emos you
9A0FZrEWcJA,1269039,1275520,know junko jeans like the big baggy  legged jeans that very popular in the  1990s they're done in black there's the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1275520,1282880,sort of panels and strips that sort of  come down and create a little bit of a  plaid shape and then it's full of little  silver hardware so grommets and
9A0FZrEWcJA,1282880,1288159,fasteners and belt clips and loops and  all that sort of it just has a very
9A0FZrEWcJA,1288159,1295280,i don't know emo feeling to it which i  appreciate you know what i mean like  it's fun little reference feels very  demna next up we have jamie she and she
9A0FZrEWcJA,1295280,1302799,is wearing balenciaga as well she was at  the resort 2023 show this i believe is a  look from fall 2022 now it's essentially
9A0FZrEWcJA,1302799,1309679,a large oversized denim jacket it has a  little bit of a sloped back as we can  see from the side and then it's also
9A0FZrEWcJA,1309679,1315840,paired with a pair of jenko jeans  they're in a sort of lighter black wash  she's wearing a little pump in a black
9A0FZrEWcJA,1315840,1321679,leather they're not you know a panty  shoe which is nice and then it's paired  with a green balenciaga bag it's not
9A0FZrEWcJA,1321679,1327520,like a hateable look because it's very  much so again sort of reference these  big sort of large baggy styles which
9A0FZrEWcJA,1327520,1334159,demna's whole growing up sort of style  which i think he was probably very in  that like emo phase wearing oversized
9A0FZrEWcJA,1334159,1341039,baggy clothes was very much a part of  his sort of expression at that pivotal  teenage time i would say and so it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1341039,1347679,definitely sort of falling out into  balenciaga and at the same time if you  think about the history of balenciaga  big bold silhouettes very much so a part
9A0FZrEWcJA,1347679,1354159,of the brand so you can sort of piece  together that these things do make sense  in more modern cultural context i will
9A0FZrEWcJA,1354159,1360159,say i think it's hard when you pair with  those dainty little  shoes don't really work but i appreciate
9A0FZrEWcJA,1360159,1365919,that we went for it i appreciate it i  don't love it but i appreciate it next  up we have kanye he is wearing
9A0FZrEWcJA,1365919,1371760,balenciaga honestly nice kanye look i  think it's very uncharacter but at the  same time there are just some strange
9A0FZrEWcJA,1371760,1376799,elements that make it a little bit more  fashion forward so we have this cropped  leather bomber jacket i think it's nice
9A0FZrEWcJA,1376799,1382000,with the hoodie he's wearing hoodie it's  all good and then there's obviously like  a length to the hoodie which is sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,1382000,1388000,reminiscing on days gone by of those  long uh rick owensy sort of style
9A0FZrEWcJA,1388000,1394720,hoodies that were really really popular  kanye also wore a lot of those like long  styles he probably was what what the if
9A0FZrEWcJA,1394720,1401039,not one of the people that sort of made  that like long length t-shirt that was  very rick owens popular amongst the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1401039,1407360,hypebeasts of the world and i feel like  at this point we're getting to like the  10-year anniversary of that so maybe  kanye is bringing it back the jeans they
9A0FZrEWcJA,1407360,1412960,fit well they fit nicely and then  they're tucked into these comically  large boots but the boots are also like
9A0FZrEWcJA,1412960,1418640,very balenciaga it's essentially a work  boot that's been done and i presume some  sort of leather they're just really
9A0FZrEWcJA,1418640,1424720,large and they look like clown boots but  i'm also kind of obsessed and if kanye's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1424720,1431039,gonna do one thing he's boots that are  intriguing and interesting and  fashionable and all that sort of there  so this to me feels very
9A0FZrEWcJA,1431039,1438159,kanye ten years ago but done more of  like a balenciaga twist and a feel and a  vibe the boots great very memorable it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1438159,1443760,kanye isn't it can't complain at least  about the fashion choices we're at the  kourtney kardashian wedding sponsored by
9A0FZrEWcJA,1443760,1448960,dolce gabbana prepare yourself first up  we have khloe kardashian she is wearing
9A0FZrEWcJA,1448960,1455679,an off-the-shoulder black lace dress  it's made up of quite a lot of frills in  terms of the skirt it's fitted very
9A0FZrEWcJA,1455679,1462799,closely to the body very dolce gabbana i  would say in terms of like house codes  you know what the brand is known for
9A0FZrEWcJA,1462799,1469200,there's a very sort of  fitted lace bodice she's also wearing a  large gold crown headpiece and like to
9A0FZrEWcJA,1469200,1476080,be completely honest and i really would  rather not say this about anything dolce  related it's like a nice look chloe
9A0FZrEWcJA,1476080,1483360,looks good i really truly cannot  complain about it it's not bad like you  know the rosary bead waist belt with the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1483360,1490960,crucifix or the cross coming down and i  would say maybe a little bit  sacrilegious i don't know i'm not a  practicing catholic anymore but
9A0FZrEWcJA,1490960,1497840,it could be a lot worse chloe's done far  more egregious fashion things in the  past i will take this
9A0FZrEWcJA,1497840,1502960,shockingly next we have kim kardashian  now she is wearing honestly it's a good
9A0FZrEWcJA,1502960,1508480,look i can't complain like i i truly i  cannot complain that kim looks like  she's going to a funeral but i mean if
9A0FZrEWcJA,1508480,1514240,you're getting married with like a  sponsorship by dolce gana pretty much as  a funeral you know what it reminds me of  even though it doesn't actually remind
9A0FZrEWcJA,1514240,1520240,me of it whatsoever i think just with  the blonde hair and all that it reminds  me of the italian movie malenna which
9A0FZrEWcJA,1520240,1525919,stars monica bellucci and it's just a  very good  like italian movie not like la dolce
9A0FZrEWcJA,1525919,1531760,vida even though i've never seen ladolce  vita because  the girls won't license it to be seen  anywhere
9A0FZrEWcJA,1531760,1539200,but regardless i think it's actually a  great look the choker with the big sort  of over-the-top bodacious gold portrait
9A0FZrEWcJA,1539200,1544320,style in the green  shape with what looks like a bunch of  different beads that are sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,1544320,1550080,recreated we have the big sort of cross  it's very byzantine  inspired and
9A0FZrEWcJA,1550080,1555919,looking this also is like a full from  what i believe vintage look and it's  also not even all dolce i think the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1555919,1562720,dress maybe is dolce but the lace  bodysuit is not we have this beautiful  lace  sleeved what i can only presume is like
9A0FZrEWcJA,1562720,1568720,a body suit and or a shirt and then  we're pairing it over a very fitted  black lace dress which i believe is
9A0FZrEWcJA,1568720,1575760,actually dolce and then the whole thing  is vintage it's not from dolce gabon  it's from kim's personal archive i  believe which i'm shocked but i think
9A0FZrEWcJA,1575760,1583039,it's a good look it's the best that kim  has sort of done since departing with  her stylist and i am here for it it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1583039,1590320,cute it works it's very enjoyable it's  not some like  garbage dolce gabbana off the runway
9A0FZrEWcJA,1590320,1597200, evidently kim does know what she's  doing she learned a little bit while she  was kanye kimberly i'm proud shockingly
9A0FZrEWcJA,1597200,1604000,next up we have kris jenner and she's  back to a caftan moment it's this light  light light pink feathered style it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1604000,1609440,full of paellas and reflective  iridescent colors and then also it looks
9A0FZrEWcJA,1609440,1615760,like the feathers are meant to sort of  create some sort of shape so we can see  it sort of coming along the neckline we  can also see it coming down and sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,1615760,1621760,accentuating the bust area accentuating  the sort of waist and then it sort of  forms of v as it comes down off the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1621760,1629039,sleeves with the caftan still not a  great look chris loves loves a flowing  sort of style and i get it i just also
9A0FZrEWcJA,1629039,1636960,don't think it's  good next let's talk about kendall  jenner's look again wearing dolce  gabbana it's pretty much a semi-fitted
9A0FZrEWcJA,1636960,1642640,jacket with a matching high-waisted  skirt it's in beige and then there's a  floral motif it has a very like
9A0FZrEWcJA,1642640,1648720,still-life portrait feeling to it of  like a beautiful bouquet of flowers and
9A0FZrEWcJA,1648720,1653760,foliage and leaves and vines and stems  blossoms and all that but it's just had
9A0FZrEWcJA,1653760,1659120,all the color sucked out of it so it's  this sort of brown experience with  little white highlights it's not
9A0FZrEWcJA,1659120,1665520,horrible kendall jenner could have worn  much worse i would say it's not great  it's not horrible jacket fit is like
9A0FZrEWcJA,1665520,1671279,decent the sleeves are a little bit big  and the way that the jacket fits around  the bust area seems a little bit tight
9A0FZrEWcJA,1671279,1678159,and then it flares out it seems like a  little bit too tight because you can see  that the fabric is like  pulling kind of hard but then the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1678159,1684080,sleeves are like baggy skirt fits well  though so you know we could have let  that jacket out just a little bit but
9A0FZrEWcJA,1684080,1690320,yeah i mean like not memorable not super  intriguing or exciting we're guests at a  wedding so that's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1690320,1696320,fine i guess although kim and chloe are  like somewhat decently memorable so  maybe it's not maybe it's not all it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1696320,1702480,cracked up to be then we have kylie she  is wearing essentially a body con slip
9A0FZrEWcJA,1702480,1709679,sort of style dress it's beige and then  it has some the motif is made up of red  roses and foliage flowers and all that
9A0FZrEWcJA,1709679,1717399,sort of stuff again like it's just not  really super interesting and then  because it's so fitted we can see so  much puckering the puckering isn't
9A0FZrEWcJA,1717399,1723120,amazing it feels like it's too tightly  fitted but i mean i guess as the  movement goes it's like whatever a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1723120,1730399,little wicker basket bag and then a  clear sort of sandal shoe  again  i think there's a way to feel intriguing
9A0FZrEWcJA,1730399,1737760,at a wedding without it being poorly  done and it feels like the jenner aspect  of the karjenner grouping didn't get
9A0FZrEWcJA,1737760,1746399,that memo unfortunately and finally on  to the grand poobah herself kourtney  kardashian as i said i'm very rarely one
9A0FZrEWcJA,1746399,1752559,to comment on somebody's wedding dress  but i mean essentially let's look at it  from the dress aspect not that there's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1752559,1758799,so much dress going on it's essentially  a lace lingerie slip with a large basque
9A0FZrEWcJA,1758799,1765360,style corset that doesn't actually have  breast cups placed over top we can see  the boning it's very visible little bits
9A0FZrEWcJA,1765360,1771360,of floral lace sort of fall out at the  scalloped hem of the dress there's a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1771360,1776480,sheer  white  glove situation going on and
9A0FZrEWcJA,1776480,1783840,some lace coming out at the bust area to  each their own we want to do what we  want to do i get it i understand it
9A0FZrEWcJA,1783840,1791200,congrats to you  i wouldn't have chosen that but  it's also just weird because dolce
9A0FZrEWcJA,1791200,1797039,gabbana called the kardashians like  trash or whatever on instagram however  many years ago so it's like hard to
9A0FZrEWcJA,1797039,1802399,feel as if this isn't  a  trap because it's not it's not a super
9A0FZrEWcJA,1802399,1809520,memorable look and i think obviously  they're two completely different vibes  courtney is going for this but you look
9A0FZrEWcJA,1809520,1816720,at somebody like lady kitty spencer who  had her dress made by dolce gabbana and  you say to yourself self say you wow
9A0FZrEWcJA,1816720,1824320,they really can do great work just  depends on who what when where why and  maybe sometimes how it's not great
9A0FZrEWcJA,1824320,1830640,at all now we've looked at the dress  obviously but when courtney actually got  married in portofino in italy at the
9A0FZrEWcJA,1830640,1836080,dolce gabbana compound he did have a  large veil that was placed over top of
9A0FZrEWcJA,1836080,1843679,the look which is more attractive it's  sort of piped in a scallop sort of lace  it's sheer and then it does have sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,1843679,1852080,large elements of floral motifs running  throughout it and depiction of what i  would presume is the virgin mary madonna
9A0FZrEWcJA,1852080,1858320,so i think from my understanding it's a  reference to travis's own tattoos he  does have like a tattoo somewhere on his
9A0FZrEWcJA,1858320,1865360,body of the virgin mary so i think  that's probably what we were going for i  would presume in the referencing i think  that's beautiful honestly genuinely i
9A0FZrEWcJA,1865360,1870880,think it's a nice sort of tie-in to the  person that you're getting married to  the person that you love you care about
9A0FZrEWcJA,1870880,1876000,i think it's very sweet i think it's  very lovely i finally saw that photo i'd  be like absolutely to each their own get
9A0FZrEWcJA,1876000,1881600,married live your best life happy for  you would i say that you should do it at  the dolce game compound and then have
9A0FZrEWcJA,1881600,1888640,the whole thing sponsored by dolce  gabbana when you're multi-millionaires  who could afford your own wedding no i  have a video about it that i've written
9A0FZrEWcJA,1888640,1894960,if you'd like for me to like talk about  the way that dolce gabbana is  maneuvering their pr in a very  intriguing and new way at least from my
9A0FZrEWcJA,1894960,1900080,perspective and we can discuss it it's a  pretty veil the dress not for me but who
9A0FZrEWcJA,1900080,1907679,am i to say yes to the dress  dolce gabbana edition next we have  kristen stewart and she is wearing  chanel now this is from the what spring
9A0FZrEWcJA,1907679,1914640,2022  collection which was a collection that  virginia vr did that was based on
9A0FZrEWcJA,1914640,1920960,previous cara logo fellow collection  from the 1990s  one of the sort of famous chanel goes to
9A0FZrEWcJA,1920960,1927600,the beach french riviera but make it  1990s a fide i think it's cute look i  think it's fun essentially it is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1927600,1934159,one-piece sort of swimsuit in white with  little black piping and a little chanel  cc in the center i think it's nice
9A0FZrEWcJA,1934159,1939440,doesn't offend me which i will take and  what virginia has done is taken a little
9A0FZrEWcJA,1939440,1945120,cover-up skirt she's placed a little  silk band at the waist and then there's  a little white chameleon in the center
9A0FZrEWcJA,1945120,1951200,of the bow on the waist and the silk and  then from that it's like a black mesh  that falls down to the floor it seems
9A0FZrEWcJA,1951200,1956240,like kristen stewart has added like a  boot which i think is intriguing because  you're going to the beach or at least
9A0FZrEWcJA,1956240,1962080,you're i guess technically you think  you're going to the beach but i think  it's very kristen stewart styling to be
9A0FZrEWcJA,1962080,1968240,completely honest to take something very  sort of light and feminine and chanelly  and make it a little bit harder a little  bit edgier i think it's a nice look i
9A0FZrEWcJA,1968240,1974320,think it's fun i actually think it was a  really really good collection by  virginia and i feel like we didn't get  to see too too much of it so
9A0FZrEWcJA,1974320,1980480,nice next up we have lana del rey  wearing gucci now this was taken at  gucci's resort 2023 collection honestly
9A0FZrEWcJA,1980480,1987600,though unfortunately it's not a great  look i would personally say we have a  blazer with black silk lapels and then a
9A0FZrEWcJA,1987600,1993840,sort of light motif and i presume  crystallized jacket it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,1993840,1999039,it's existing it's a print preference i  would say what kind of print preference
9A0FZrEWcJA,1999039,2006480,it is not sure it seems like we paired a  sort of little shirt underneath and like  a turquoise that must have some sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2006480,2011519,feathered sleeves which love feathered  sleeve and then a little mini skirt or
9A0FZrEWcJA,2011519,2016720,at least a skirt to the dress that is  sheer and sort of has the gucci monogram
9A0FZrEWcJA,2016720,2023440,sort of running throughout it and then a  mixture of what i would say is like an  80s platform boot meets cowboy aesthetic
9A0FZrEWcJA,2023440,2029760,again this is my version of summertime  sadness it's very unfortunate very  dillards i should probably say it sucks
9A0FZrEWcJA,2029760,2035200,that this is what she's wearing and that  it couldn't be better that's what i  meant it also does suck in general as
9A0FZrEWcJA,2035200,2040720,like an outfit but like i'm like oh the  fact that she is wearing this sucks  because i would want something better so
9A0FZrEWcJA,2040720,2047760,just want to clarify next up we have  lewis hamilton and he is wearing  valentino now this is from the fall 2022
9A0FZrEWcJA,2047760,2053200,valentino collection it is the pee pee  pink bright neon pink look now it's a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2053200,2061040,baggy shirt sweater and a wide legged  pant and a  pink sneaker very valentino that's fine
9A0FZrEWcJA,2061040,2067520,i think it's a big sort of baggy style i  think also in like f1 not that i've  really watched that show on netflix i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2067520,2072878,watched one episode that was really good  for me i wouldn't say that this is your  normal sort of looks that you know you
9A0FZrEWcJA,2072878,2078720,see on the grand prix sort of post-pre  i'm not sure really truly what they wear  but i would say it's probably not
9A0FZrEWcJA,2078720,2084960,violent pink and oversized and large so  i appreciate lewis hamilton doing  something a little bit more exciting or
9A0FZrEWcJA,2084960,2091760,at least intriguing or at least  something to look at next up let's talk  about lucian loves kong and he is
9A0FZrEWcJA,2091760,2099119,wearing dior no this is from the what  fall 2022 menswear dior collection i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2099119,2106079,love this look i think it's the most  intriguing one that we saw at the resort  2023 dior men's show because it actually
9A0FZrEWcJA,2106079,2111680,felt like there was a styling element in  it so whoever lucien's stylist is
9A0FZrEWcJA,2111680,2118079,shout out to you because you like  actually did the job you didn't just  take the look from the runway and then  just put it on him no no there was like
9A0FZrEWcJA,2118079,2125280,an element of cool things were taken  things were added so as we can see a  sort of staple now of the kim jones dior
9A0FZrEWcJA,2125280,2132000,men  vibe and aesthetic are these draped and  sort of gathered lasers so it nips in at
9A0FZrEWcJA,2132000,2139280,the waist i think essentially it's kim  jones way of sort of taking on christian  dior's  very new look silhouette a very wasp
9A0FZrEWcJA,2139280,2144400,waist this sort of really tight and  rigid sort of emphasis on the waist but  doing it without it being you know a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2144400,2149680,corseted sort of waist sculpting  situation but rather utilizing the  fabric and the way that it could be
9A0FZrEWcJA,2149680,2154720,draped to create that emphasis and i  think it's very smart we've been seeing  it for years now and it has a little
9A0FZrEWcJA,2154720,2161440,pull away it's sort of like a little  train that comes out of the blazer again  sort of redefining what tailoring is  that's what kim jones does very very
9A0FZrEWcJA,2161440,2166640,well underneath that shirt instead of  what is you know just usual simple  button down we actually can see a little
9A0FZrEWcJA,2166640,2173680,sheer top which is obviously such a  light shear that it matches and sort of  sits beautifully on lucian's body but
9A0FZrEWcJA,2173680,2181680,it's embroidered with really delicate  little floral details i wrote about this  show on instagram essentially these are
9A0FZrEWcJA,2181680,2186880,actual references back to christian dior  embroidery from when monsieur dior was
9A0FZrEWcJA,2186880,2192000,alive from 1947 to 1957 and it's really  beautiful i thought it was like honestly
9A0FZrEWcJA,2192000,2198880,such a lovely sort of way of redefining  and sort of reigniting not only  christian dior heritage but also
9A0FZrEWcJA,2198880,2204480,reimagining it for a modern menswear  sort of detail and now throughout the  collection it was placed over top of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2204480,2209520,button downshirt so it gave like a  little layered cool element while still  keeping that traditional menswear
9A0FZrEWcJA,2209520,2215760,tailoring vibe but here instead it's  just worn over a bare chest which  honestly we love i think it's intriguing
9A0FZrEWcJA,2215760,2220800,to see a sort of man's bare chest with  hair and all that sort of stuff and then  you have this little floral very light
9A0FZrEWcJA,2220800,2227440,very feminine embroidery over top i  think it's really cool juxtaposition and  all the while it's underneath a blazer
9A0FZrEWcJA,2227440,2232960,so again it is really cool i appreciate  that lucian did it again it's just  taking the little subtle details and
9A0FZrEWcJA,2232960,2239280,mixing and matching them as for the  pants they correlate to the actual look  from the blazer and it's a front you
9A0FZrEWcJA,2239280,2246079,know pleated gray wool pant i presume  that it's a reference to christian  dior's very signature iconic gray was a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2246079,2251200,color that he used often time and time  again he believed that it was great for  any sort of fabric any sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2251200,2257440,silhouette any sort of type that he was  utilizing it was something that he just  really really loved the dior gray very
9A0FZrEWcJA,2257440,2264000,iconic so i think that's what we're  getting a reference to here i also think  the fact that you have the pants  scrunched up and the socks it adds this
9A0FZrEWcJA,2264000,2270240,cool layer of texturing that correlates  to the actual jacket which again is  really really smart honestly though i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2270240,2275440,will say that i think this is one of my  favorite menswear looks that i've seen  in a very long time i think it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,2275440,2281119,fantastic i think it's really really  cool shout out lucian lexcon shout out  to york a moment 100 percent without a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2281119,2289359,doubt  next up we have monda apatow and she is  wearing louis vuitton now this is a look  from fall 2022. it is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2289359,2296720,turtleneck gray sweater over a mini  skirt with a large sort of wrap peplum
9A0FZrEWcJA,2296720,2302240,that falls down and creates a train with  looped tassels and then a knee-high
9A0FZrEWcJA,2302240,2307920,leather tan boot i wish the boot was  gray i know that like there was a lot of  these boots going around which is fine
9A0FZrEWcJA,2307920,2313520,but like i just wish the boot was gray  now listen when you look at it on the  runway the look that it was from it has  like a big jacket but they were in
9A0FZrEWcJA,2313520,2318640,california so like i get it we're not  gonna wear that maybe it's a little bit  dramatic i think that honestly this is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2318640,2324000,pretty decent job of paring down  the look while still keeping the weird
9A0FZrEWcJA,2324000,2329920,elements of it i also think that with  the miniskirt and the big sort of  tassels while yes there was like a mule
9A0FZrEWcJA,2329920,2336480,on the runway or a sandal honestly i  don't love the way that the turtleneck  tucks into the skirt aspect of it i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2336480,2341599,think it looks a little bit crunchy but  besides that i think it's an intriguing  look i appreciate the oddness of the
9A0FZrEWcJA,2341599,2346800,mini skirt very 1960s but giving the  nikolajeski a weird spin it's fine looks
9A0FZrEWcJA,2346800,2354079,cute it's intriguing i like this from  mod apatow i feel like a lot of the  stuff that she does when she's in san  lorenzo simple and easy and sort of sexy
9A0FZrEWcJA,2354079,2359920,and skin tight and this feels a little  bit different a little bit more out  there a little bit more fashion i would  say
9A0FZrEWcJA,2359920,2365839,i'm i'm okay with that i'd like to see  where this goes because  i like a mod after towel now the last
9A0FZrEWcJA,2365839,2371280,megan asylum look we'll discuss is from  botega's fall 2021 collection it is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2371280,2376960,strapless fitted cocktail dress i  presume i think it is a knit to make  sense for bottega and what it has is
9A0FZrEWcJA,2376960,2382720,these little sort of loop tassels that  accentuate the hip area i think this is  great i think this makes sense for megan
9A0FZrEWcJA,2382720,2388160,i think it works for megan i think it is  body conscious it fits exposes elements
9A0FZrEWcJA,2388160,2394960,of the body you know the whole sort of  shoulder chest area is exposed it fits  her body really really well the great
9A0FZrEWcJA,2394960,2400640,thing about a knit is it's going to  suction in it's going to sort of puff  out depending on what the body is i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2400640,2405760,think that it fits really really  beautifully but the great thing about  this dress is these little loop tassels
9A0FZrEWcJA,2405760,2410880,they create an accentuation of the hip i  personally think that it's a reference  to sort of panniers and sort of things
9A0FZrEWcJA,2410880,2418480,like that of that nature and for megan  accentuating the body not just in a  body-con sense i think is smart it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,2418480,2424000,part of her brand it's what she does  everything's sort of about body yada  yada yada yada yada yeah buddy
9A0FZrEWcJA,2424000,2430720,sort of style makes sense for her is why  not instead of just doing things that  fit and sort of suck in and sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2430720,2435839,showcase the silhouette why not  have you expand upon your own silhouette
9A0FZrEWcJA,2435839,2441839,and exaggerate or de-exaggerate as you  will or as you want i think that is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2441839,2446960,smart way for megan to sort of be more  high-fashion than rather just sort of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2446960,2452240,sexy clingy and all that there you know  i mean like if she's gonna do  avant-garde which i think she should do
9A0FZrEWcJA,2452240,2458480,because i think it's cute and it's fun  and we'd love to see it i think sort of  accentuating the body in a way that is
9A0FZrEWcJA,2458480,2465040,exaggerated and crazy but still very  body forming and body conscious and  exploring i think that's the smart way
9A0FZrEWcJA,2465040,2471520,for megan to do it and i think this is a  good example of that so i love this  happy for megan let's keep this going
9A0FZrEWcJA,2471520,2478800,next we have miley cyrus and she is  wearing a vintage alexander mcqueen  dress we love to see it essentially it
9A0FZrEWcJA,2478800,2485359,is a very sort of light peachy pink it  has a strap situation it looks like a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2485359,2490640,slick dress but what has been done here  is there's elements of lingerie sort of  placed throughout this little bow right
9A0FZrEWcJA,2490640,2497440,at the center of the bra meeting point  and then we have little ruche light pink  you know chiffon that sort of comes up
9A0FZrEWcJA,2497440,2503760,and sort of creates texture on the bust  but the thing that i think is super fun  about this mcqueen dress is the way that
9A0FZrEWcJA,2503760,2510000,underneath the bust that arching that  slopes underneath it sort of creates  texture which normally i'd sit there and
9A0FZrEWcJA,2510000,2515200,be like why it doesn't fit why would you  do that but because it's a mcqueen and
9A0FZrEWcJA,2515200,2520480,it's a vintage mcqueen my personal  opinion is it's a reference to cowl  necks now if you look at a lot of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2520480,2526560,mcqueen collections from the early years  you will see cowl necks they are done  sort of in the front you will see cowl
9A0FZrEWcJA,2526560,2532880,necks in the back where essentially it's  backless and the drape sort of comes out  there's a lot of cowl necks bunching up
9A0FZrEWcJA,2532880,2539520,a fabric sound really really beautifully  it was something that he did when he was  not doing this really rigid tailoring  although he did it there too but when he
9A0FZrEWcJA,2539520,2545200,was doing things that were light and  sort of diaphanous the cowl neck  definitely seeped so while this isn't a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2545200,2550319,cowl neck i would say i do think it's an  intriguing element of mcqueen's lasting
9A0FZrEWcJA,2550319,2555839,house codes and designs that you can  sort of see in this dress i think it's  lovely i think pulling out vintage
9A0FZrEWcJA,2555839,2561839,mcqueen is the way to go you're going to  pull out adventure designers why not  alexander mcqueen he's a legend
9A0FZrEWcJA,2561839,2566960,star he's an icon i'm not opposed to the  bias cut he was great at we love to see
9A0FZrEWcJA,2566960,2572800,it next up we have millie bobby brown  she is wearing a custom louis vuitton  dress so essentially it is a silk i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2572800,2578319,presume a satin strapless dress in and  of itself like the silk satin element of
9A0FZrEWcJA,2578319,2583839,the dress is satin in the sort of light  pearlescent white or very very light
9A0FZrEWcJA,2583839,2590560,gray there's a high sort of slit and  then there's a belt sort of put over top  and a little black sort of chiffon
9A0FZrEWcJA,2590560,2596640,gathered piece that wraps around the  shoulder i don't think it's great the  issue is obviously like the satin in and
9A0FZrEWcJA,2596640,2602000,of itself is just a hard fabric  especially in a color like that that's  so light it's gonna reflect where every
9A0FZrEWcJA,2602000,2609200,crease and wrinkle and crinkle is and if  you're not looking at it in person it  doesn't look great i also just think
9A0FZrEWcJA,2609200,2615760,that it's very simplistic and it feels  like millie should in my opinion at the  very least sort of reference maybe a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2615760,2621680,little bit more 80s a little bit more  stranger things a little bit more levany  kind of vibes in and of itself it's not
9A0FZrEWcJA,2621680,2627680,a great dress and then the black  gathered tool that sort of wraps around  the shoulder is also just not great i
9A0FZrEWcJA,2627680,2632960,don't know what it has to do with  anything i can't really see where it  fits in overall i wish that we had maybe  just done a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2632960,2638240,little bit more kooky crazy over the top  nicolas look and
9A0FZrEWcJA,2638240,2643359,ran with it this doesn't really feel  like that this feels very slimmed down  and simple and sometimes those work from
9A0FZrEWcJA,2643359,2649280,louis vuitton custom but other times  they're real  i think this is one of the real
9A0FZrEWcJA,2649280,2656640,moments unfortunately next up we have  nicola coughlin and she is wearing  valentina now i believe that this is a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2656640,2663200,custom look but i believe that it's  based on valentino's spring 2022 old  couture collection it's this beautiful
9A0FZrEWcJA,2663200,2668640,crisp pink stunning silk dress it's full  of these bows that sort of wrap
9A0FZrEWcJA,2668640,2674960,asymmetrically around the neckline and  also the sleeves it's just a great dress  it's bright it's very valentino the bose
9A0FZrEWcJA,2674960,2680960,or signature house code of the brand you  know it's simplistic in all other ways  it fits her really really well it's a
9A0FZrEWcJA,2680960,2687760,nice dress that there's not much else to  really say about it next up we have  phoebe donover and she is wearing louis  vuitton now she is also wearing a look
9A0FZrEWcJA,2687760,2695520,from the fall  2022. collection this time instead of it  having a sweater and a intriguing knit
9A0FZrEWcJA,2695520,2701280,motif and a pair of camo fringe  pants
9A0FZrEWcJA,2701280,2706560,it's just the striped sort of rugby  style shirt dress to be completely
9A0FZrEWcJA,2706560,2712560,honest i think it may be a little bit  better that way sometimes crazy cookie  works other times strip down probably
9A0FZrEWcJA,2712560,2718319,the better choice i think it's just the  pants plus  you know the sweater or plusher dress
9A0FZrEWcJA,2718319,2725119,might not be great and also i think the  fact that we've done it with a nice  little square toe brown boot fine it's
9A0FZrEWcJA,2725119,2730640,okay with the navy blue and the maroon  and the gray from the rugby shirt the
9A0FZrEWcJA,2730640,2738079,leather i think looks nice and then the  white sort of soles playing with the  white sort of trim on you know the color
9A0FZrEWcJA,2738079,2744079,and the buttons and the pockets and all  that it's fine it's totally fine we're  gonna take it we're gonna move on so we
9A0FZrEWcJA,2744079,2751119,have simone ashley and she is wearing  conor eyes now this is a look from fall  2022. it's essentially what i believe is
9A0FZrEWcJA,2751119,2756480,like a multi-scarf halter sort of top  that falls away and sort of creates
9A0FZrEWcJA,2756480,2763760,little hoops and then it's paired with a  sort of very tight-fitted pant that has  a split hem i don't think it's horrible
9A0FZrEWcJA,2763760,2771119,i believe that she's in in monaco at  like the grand prix whether she's  pre-pre or post-pre i'm not sure
9A0FZrEWcJA,2771119,2777760,but i think the halter style works i  think it's cute british star supporting  a designer based in the uk
9A0FZrEWcJA,2777760,2784400,sustainability and the fact that it's  probably different little scarves that  have been reconfigured to create the top
