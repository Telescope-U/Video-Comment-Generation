mS4Y_avaBWw,30,2340,hello everyone and welcome back to
mS4Y_avaBWw,2340,4859,another minecraft update video we are
mS4Y_avaBWw,4859,6839,currently in bedrock edition this is
mS4Y_avaBWw,6839,8849,beta one point two point twenty point
mS4Y_avaBWw,8849,12500,one and in this edition you can enable
mS4Y_avaBWw,12500,15809,education edition and this unlocks the
mS4Y_avaBWw,15809,18840,chemistry lab which brings chemistry
mS4Y_avaBWw,18840,21449,into Minecraft now disclaimer alert I
mS4Y_avaBWw,21449,24570,was not taught this stuff at school so I
mS4Y_avaBWw,24570,26430,know what a periodic table is I have
mS4Y_avaBWw,26430,28170,actually built one using these blocks
mS4Y_avaBWw,28170,30630,which represent the different elements
mS4Y_avaBWw,30630,33540,in the periodic table so when it comes
mS4Y_avaBWw,33540,35460,to things being scientifically accurate
mS4Y_avaBWw,35460,37559,I'm not your guy unfortunately but I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,37559,38790,gonna walk you for all the things that
mS4Y_avaBWw,38790,41040,have been added with this and it is
mS4Y_avaBWw,41040,42989,pretty pretty fantastic pretty
mS4Y_avaBWw,42989,44520,interesting it comes with a lot of
mS4Y_avaBWw,44520,46800,practical uses in survival mode as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,46800,48960,there are items gonna change how you
mS4Y_avaBWw,48960,51360,play the game in survival minecraft but
mS4Y_avaBWw,51360,53579,if we scroll down here now those items
mS4Y_avaBWw,53579,56579,are actually accessible as you will see
mS4Y_avaBWw,56579,58559,we have all of the different elements of
mS4Y_avaBWw,58559,60390,the periodic table right here all of
mS4Y_avaBWw,60390,62160,these names so many of them are very
mS4Y_avaBWw,62160,65610,interesting and cool and that's all that
mS4Y_avaBWw,65610,67409,there appears to be but believe me there
mS4Y_avaBWw,67409,69840,is in fact more things to check out for
mS4Y_avaBWw,69840,72270,example there are sparklers underwater
mS4Y_avaBWw,72270,75450,TNT underwater torches hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,75450,78140,blocks and a super fertilizer to make
mS4Y_avaBWw,78140,80340,plants grow instantly those are just
mS4Y_avaBWw,80340,81720,some of the things that have been added
mS4Y_avaBWw,81720,83280,and we're gonna check out every single
mS4Y_avaBWw,83280,85860,thing that's been added with this I will
mS4Y_avaBWw,85860,87479,open this chest and show you a couple of
mS4Y_avaBWw,87479,89729,examples there is some elixir right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,89729,92130,which can cure blindness if I remember
mS4Y_avaBWw,92130,94020,correctly we'll go over that again later
mS4Y_avaBWw,94020,95729,and I'll tell you exactly what it is
mS4Y_avaBWw,95729,97829,that it does we've also got these red
mS4Y_avaBWw,97829,99540,balloons which are filled up with helium
mS4Y_avaBWw,99540,102509,so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,102509,105360,spawn a pig and then I'm going to attach
mS4Y_avaBWw,105360,107340,the balloon to the pig and the pig is
mS4Y_avaBWw,107340,109560,going to go off into the sky you know
mS4Y_avaBWw,109560,112979,real practical uses peeps that's a very
mS4Y_avaBWw,112979,115890,practical use it's gone it's literally
mS4Y_avaBWw,115890,117719,gone I I want to do that a couple more
mS4Y_avaBWw,117719,121909,times oh wow don't run away just yet
mS4Y_avaBWw,121909,124619,look at that we're making pigs fly oh
mS4Y_avaBWw,124619,127429,they go up this so quickly don't they
mS4Y_avaBWw,127429,129720,now if you're watching this video and
mS4Y_avaBWw,129720,131550,you're part of the beta of the bedrock
mS4Y_avaBWw,131550,133170,edition you might be thinking I want to
mS4Y_avaBWw,133170,133920,check this out
mS4Y_avaBWw,133920,135690,self and I'll show you exactly how you
mS4Y_avaBWw,135690,138270,go about doing that you need to create a
mS4Y_avaBWw,138270,140130,new weld and then in the options for
mS4Y_avaBWw,140130,141180,creating a new world you need to
mS4Y_avaBWw,141180,143540,activate cheats and then simply select
mS4Y_avaBWw,143540,145680,education edition and this is gonna add
mS4Y_avaBWw,145680,148170,the chemistry lab to your game now if
mS4Y_avaBWw,148170,149580,you're thinking I want to know how to be
mS4Y_avaBWw,149580,152190,a part of the beta that is something I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,152190,153750,not gonna tell you in this video because
mS4Y_avaBWw,153750,155910,it was a huge pain in the butt for me to
mS4Y_avaBWw,155910,158610,actually get into the beta and to get it
mS4Y_avaBWw,158610,160350,working and it's not the sort of thing I
mS4Y_avaBWw,160350,161940,can make a tutorial on but you can go
mS4Y_avaBWw,161940,163530,look up other guides and if you run into
mS4Y_avaBWw,163530,165569,problems you will know the headache that
mS4Y_avaBWw,165569,167670,I went through to get this to work but
mS4Y_avaBWw,167670,169830,anyway let's go and jump back into our
mS4Y_avaBWw,169830,170420,world
mS4Y_avaBWw,170420,173760,so we shall start by checking out two of
mS4Y_avaBWw,173760,176519,these blocks the first one is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,176519,179400,element constructor and look at these
mS4Y_avaBWw,179400,180959,textures man I love that it's got a
mS4Y_avaBWw,180959,183239,unique texture on each side these blocks
mS4Y_avaBWw,183239,185670,are extremely cool we have the material
mS4Y_avaBWw,185670,187140,reducer as well we're gonna check that
mS4Y_avaBWw,187140,189120,one out second so let's go and open up
mS4Y_avaBWw,189120,191220,the element constructor this is gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,191220,194640,require no power no items being put into
mS4Y_avaBWw,194640,196049,it it's basically going to give you
mS4Y_avaBWw,196049,197790,stuff for free what you have to do is
mS4Y_avaBWw,197790,201060,configure the elements and you do that
mS4Y_avaBWw,201060,202769,by telling it the amount of protons
mS4Y_avaBWw,202769,205410,electrons and neutrons that are going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,205410,207510,go into this so let's start by adding a
mS4Y_avaBWw,207510,210239,proton and an electron and we've created
mS4Y_avaBWw,210239,212519,the very first element which is hydrogen
mS4Y_avaBWw,212519,215040,and I can simply just you know drag that
mS4Y_avaBWw,215040,216840,over and over again probably can shift
mS4Y_avaBWw,216840,219120,drag it for a stack no you can just take
mS4Y_avaBWw,219120,220950,one at a time but that's all you have to
mS4Y_avaBWw,220950,222780,do it's pretty cool stuff now let's go
mS4Y_avaBWw,222780,224190,ahead and make the second one which is
mS4Y_avaBWw,224190,227250,helium so if I go and add one extra
mS4Y_avaBWw,227250,230280,proton one extra electron and a nutrient
mS4Y_avaBWw,230280,232410,we get helium like that it's pretty cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,232410,232739,right
mS4Y_avaBWw,232739,235440,the third one is lithium which is free
mS4Y_avaBWw,235440,238650,of each and there you go we are making
mS4Y_avaBWw,238650,240450,the elements now you'll notice the
mS4Y_avaBWw,240450,242130,electrons have these rings around
mS4Y_avaBWw,242130,243989,outside are going to guess this is all
mS4Y_avaBWw,243989,246180,scientifically correct it would make
mS4Y_avaBWw,246180,247950,sense that it is because education
mS4Y_avaBWw,247950,249180,edition I don't think they're going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,249180,253010,half-ass anything here that is extremely
mS4Y_avaBWw,253010,255810,peculiar and interesting to me and so is
mS4Y_avaBWw,255810,258090,all of this but as we as we drag them
mS4Y_avaBWw,258090,259769,around randomly you see it's kind of
mS4Y_avaBWw,259769,262409,tricky to land on the correct one so
mS4Y_avaBWw,262409,264539,let's go and do one with a different
mS4Y_avaBWw,264539,266310,amount you can also click up here for
mS4Y_avaBWw,266310,267450,example if
mS4Y_avaBWw,267450,271230,I set this to 42 this one here to 42 as
mS4Y_avaBWw,271230,274440,well and then that one to 50 we should
mS4Y_avaBWw,274440,279630,create moly bdellium oh yeah these these
mS4Y_avaBWw,279630,282300,things start to have a crazy names let's
mS4Y_avaBWw,282300,284520,go make Ron diem if we put this up to
mS4Y_avaBWw,284520,288200,five on each and then it's 58 I believe
mS4Y_avaBWw,288200,292050,58 of those makes Ron diem I'm in and
mS4Y_avaBWw,292050,293490,you can make all of the different
mS4Y_avaBWw,293490,295980,elements of the periodic table over
mS4Y_avaBWw,295980,297360,there using this thing pretty
mS4Y_avaBWw,297360,299400,fascinating right now there is another
mS4Y_avaBWw,299400,301650,way to obtain these items as well if I
mS4Y_avaBWw,301650,303570,just go in here and grab a couple of
mS4Y_avaBWw,303570,304590,random items
mS4Y_avaBWw,304590,307230,let's grab some sand from down here as
mS4Y_avaBWw,307230,310110,well and we go over to this block which
mS4Y_avaBWw,310110,312360,is the material reducer we will be able
mS4Y_avaBWw,312360,314910,to reduce materials to there the
mS4Y_avaBWw,314910,317670,elements so this could be like entirely
mS4Y_avaBWw,317670,321060,accurate certain amounts of oxygen and
mS4Y_avaBWw,321060,323340,silicon makes sand I know this silicon
mS4Y_avaBWw,323340,325520,in sound that sounds like a legit thing
mS4Y_avaBWw,325520,330480,okay so brick blocks no stone bricks no
mS4Y_avaBWw,330480,332310,I'm guessing that one no as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,332310,334380,maybe we need things that are a little
mS4Y_avaBWw,334380,336960,bit more natural for example dirts
mS4Y_avaBWw,336960,339410,perhaps grass would make sense as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,339410,342330,my friends I have discovered the errors
mS4Y_avaBWw,342330,344880,of my ways I have been putting in stacks
mS4Y_avaBWw,344880,347910,instead of single blocks if we look at
mS4Y_avaBWw,347910,349610,what makes up this carbon oxygen
mS4Y_avaBWw,349610,352200,nitrogen not even going to try to say
mS4Y_avaBWw,352200,353940,that one right there we can see what
mS4Y_avaBWw,353940,356640,makes up dirt block as well but not a
mS4Y_avaBWw,356640,359580,lot of blocks actually go into here for
mS4Y_avaBWw,359580,362430,example if I try orange stain glass not
mS4Y_avaBWw,362430,364620,having much luck maybe regular glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,364620,367740,would have been a better try so let's go
mS4Y_avaBWw,367740,371460,down here and slap one of those in no
mS4Y_avaBWw,371460,373140,doesn't accept it anyway that is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,373140,374460,other way that you can get yourself some
mS4Y_avaBWw,374460,377340,of these elements let's now check out
mS4Y_avaBWw,377340,379140,the next block right here this is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,379140,381810,compound create a man that texture is so
mS4Y_avaBWw,381810,382230,cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,382230,384210,allow this over so much we can use this
mS4Y_avaBWw,384210,385830,to take some of those elements and
mS4Y_avaBWw,385830,388230,combine them to create other things like
mS4Y_avaBWw,388230,390600,Minecraft items like charcoal ink and
mS4Y_avaBWw,390600,392490,sugar can all be made in this and then a
mS4Y_avaBWw,392490,394320,whole bunch of other crazy items as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,394320,396030,which we can use to craft some of the
mS4Y_avaBWw,396030,397560,cool stuff I'm going to be showing you
mS4Y_avaBWw,397560,400500,at the end of this video so we're gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,400500,401400,start off by do
mS4Y_avaBWw,401400,404220,is chucking in one sodium and one
mS4Y_avaBWw,404220,405990,chlorine and this is going to create
mS4Y_avaBWw,405990,410160,salt as you can see NAC oh it shows you
mS4Y_avaBWw,410160,412740,it right there we just we just made some
mS4Y_avaBWw,412740,414210,salt I've got no idea if there's any
mS4Y_avaBWw,414210,415680,uses for this and apparently I can take
mS4Y_avaBWw,415680,417180,as much as I want and then put those
mS4Y_avaBWw,417180,419370,back that's very cool now sometimes
mS4Y_avaBWw,419370,421770,you're going to need more than just once
mS4Y_avaBWw,421770,423540,if I to put in one carbon and one
mS4Y_avaBWw,423540,425490,hydrogen we don't get anything but if I
mS4Y_avaBWw,425490,428190,put in nine carbon and 20 hydrogen we
mS4Y_avaBWw,428190,431370,get ourselves some crude oil and notice
mS4Y_avaBWw,431370,433919,again it's the C and the H and then the
mS4Y_avaBWw,433919,436139,amounts that we have and I could take as
mS4Y_avaBWw,436139,439050,much crude oil as I want ah this is this
mS4Y_avaBWw,439050,441210,is insane right here so then we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,441210,443639,some iron and some sulfur to make some
mS4Y_avaBWw,443639,446340,iron sulphide ah crazy look at these
mS4Y_avaBWw,446340,447990,little items right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,447990,450389,they look very interesting and then
mS4Y_avaBWw,450389,453180,we've got six carbon and six hydrogen to
mS4Y_avaBWw,453180,455760,make benzene I think that's how you say
mS4Y_avaBWw,455760,457740,that one now not all of them require
mS4Y_avaBWw,457740,459960,just two things and you can sort of put
mS4Y_avaBWw,459960,462240,them in I believe anywhere as long as
mS4Y_avaBWw,462240,464760,they're in there together right so order
mS4Y_avaBWw,464760,466410,and stuff is not too much of a problem I
mS4Y_avaBWw,466410,467910,got one down the bottom here that
mS4Y_avaBWw,467910,470130,requires four we've got carbon we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,470130,473460,hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen or with
mS4Y_avaBWw,473460,474990,different amounts and you can put it
mS4Y_avaBWw,474990,478680,together to make luminol don't even know
mS4Y_avaBWw,478680,480090,what this stuff is but it but I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,480090,483990,excited by it and now we have the lab
mS4Y_avaBWw,483990,487139,table time for some mandatory inspection
mS4Y_avaBWw,487139,489419,of all sides of the block well not the
mS4Y_avaBWw,489419,492180,bottom side but just like those textures
mS4Y_avaBWw,492180,494340,leave me alone in here you can put
mS4Y_avaBWw,494340,495780,together some of the things you saw us
mS4Y_avaBWw,495780,498660,craft in just a moment ago and and
mS4Y_avaBWw,498660,500760,combine those things to make other items
mS4Y_avaBWw,500760,503099,of which free of these I think are
mS4Y_avaBWw,503099,504990,actually really useful in survival well
mS4Y_avaBWw,504990,507510,at least they have a use if we go into
mS4Y_avaBWw,507510,509099,here though and just quickly create some
mS4Y_avaBWw,509099,511800,a manoa hopefully I'm saying that
mS4Y_avaBWw,511800,513779,correctly I'm sorry if I'm not and we
mS4Y_avaBWw,513779,515849,mix these two things together we should
mS4Y_avaBWw,515849,517229,be able to combine that into something
mS4Y_avaBWw,517229,519330,now that just started to animate after I
mS4Y_avaBWw,519330,522029,put in that other item right so perhaps
mS4Y_avaBWw,522029,524730,that's showing you when you're doing st.
mS4Y_avaBWw,524730,527339,corrects and maybe each of these
mS4Y_avaBWw,527339,529170,different types animate depending on
mS4Y_avaBWw,529170,530910,what type of thing you're creating but
mS4Y_avaBWw,530910,534089,if I combine wow I was not expecting
mS4Y_avaBWw,534089,535260,that
mS4Y_avaBWw,535260,538170,we've got ourselves some super
mS4Y_avaBWw,538170,539670,fertilizer now here's what we're gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,539670,541650,do we're gonna put that over to one side
mS4Y_avaBWw,541650,543930,in a chest and we'll be checking it out
mS4Y_avaBWw,543930,546990,at the end of this video there is more
mS4Y_avaBWw,546990,549120,to be made though first of all we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,549120,551630,to make water and this one's a classic
mS4Y_avaBWw,551630,555390,h2o and there it is so we've got some
mS4Y_avaBWw,555390,557850,water and these things together should
mS4Y_avaBWw,557850,560310,make us a heat block of all things so
mS4Y_avaBWw,560310,562590,let's just chuck them in there and then
mS4Y_avaBWw,562590,565080,see what it says aha look this one on
mS4Y_avaBWw,565080,567420,this side now animates oh that is so
mS4Y_avaBWw,567420,569310,very cool by the way there are only four
mS4Y_avaBWw,569310,571230,things you can make in here as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,571230,572460,hopefully we will see that middle one
mS4Y_avaBWw,572460,575070,get animated as well and different
mS4Y_avaBWw,575070,577730,particle effects this time that was
mS4Y_avaBWw,577730,581810,fantastic and we now have the heat lock
mS4Y_avaBWw,581810,583740,we're gonna put it in here for later
mS4Y_avaBWw,583740,587910,peeps we're making some more stuff it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,587910,591960,sodium Act eight this time and we need
mS4Y_avaBWw,591960,594240,four of it to go into here to make an
mS4Y_avaBWw,594240,596250,ice bomb of all things there's the
mS4Y_avaBWw,596250,598760,animation let's click combined and
mS4Y_avaBWw,598760,602940,particle effects now it's time for a
mS4Y_avaBWw,602940,605450,little bit of water and the old sodium
mS4Y_avaBWw,605450,607800,hypochlorite let's just go tuck that in
mS4Y_avaBWw,607800,609750,there and we've got this animation over
mS4Y_avaBWw,609750,611130,here so there are four different things
mS4Y_avaBWw,611130,613320,you can make and we haven't seen the
mS4Y_avaBWw,613320,615450,middle one animates but anyway particle
mS4Y_avaBWw,615450,617820,effects time that was really cool and
mS4Y_avaBWw,617820,621540,we've made ourselves some bleach so for
mS4Y_avaBWw,621540,623370,the next set of items we have to do a
mS4Y_avaBWw,623370,625050,whole bunch of crafting so let's start
mS4Y_avaBWw,625050,626850,off with some of the easiest stuff first
mS4Y_avaBWw,626850,630630,of all TNT mixed with sodium makes
mS4Y_avaBWw,630630,634290,underwater TNT and then magnesium and
mS4Y_avaBWw,634290,637740,torches makes underwater torches again
mS4Y_avaBWw,637740,640950,we're gonna check these out later on so
mS4Y_avaBWw,640950,643080,using the compound creator I've made a
mS4Y_avaBWw,643080,645450,bunch of different types of chlorides
mS4Y_avaBWw,645450,647970,and now what we can do is combine those
mS4Y_avaBWw,647970,649650,chlorides with other items
mS4Y_avaBWw,649650,652200,first of all torches to make color
mS4Y_avaBWw,652200,655350,torches so that gives us a blue torch we
mS4Y_avaBWw,655350,658920,can get a red torch a purple torch and
mS4Y_avaBWw,658920,662370,last of all a green torch awesome and
mS4Y_avaBWw,662370,664950,then the other thing we can do is put
mS4Y_avaBWw,664950,666930,sticks magnesium and then each of these
mS4Y_avaBWw,666930,668680,chlorides on top of it to create
mS4Y_avaBWw,668680,670300,sparklers are different colors so we've
mS4Y_avaBWw,670300,672520,got orange and then these are just like
mS4Y_avaBWw,672520,673870,the other ones this one's gonna be red
mS4Y_avaBWw,673870,675690,isn't it yes so they kind of match
mS4Y_avaBWw,675690,678910,purple and last of all it will be green
mS4Y_avaBWw,678910,681820,yes awesome okay so we made some
mS4Y_avaBWw,681820,684339,sparklers and torches and and you know
mS4Y_avaBWw,684339,685510,we're gonna we're gonna check it out
mS4Y_avaBWw,685510,689070,later on and now for the last of our
mS4Y_avaBWw,689070,691450,crafting we can make hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,691450,694120,which simply takes longer to break
mS4Y_avaBWw,694120,695950,that's all there is to it
mS4Y_avaBWw,695950,698620,you need some aluminium oxide and some
mS4Y_avaBWw,698620,702160,boron trioxide and then it makes
mS4Y_avaBWw,702160,704560,hardened glass which I gotta say looks
mS4Y_avaBWw,704560,707410,seriously cool here's another thing you
mS4Y_avaBWw,707410,710050,can make with this polyethylene stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,710050,712600,and don't tell me I didn't actually make
mS4Y_avaBWw,712600,714100,enough apparently I didn't make enough
mS4Y_avaBWw,714100,716470,overall I did make the right amount I
mS4Y_avaBWw,716470,719410,was just missing something so if we do
mS4Y_avaBWw,719410,722830,that's look at that an orange glow stick
mS4Y_avaBWw,722830,725950,let's make a purple one and a cyan one
mS4Y_avaBWw,725950,728649,as well so there are four different
mS4Y_avaBWw,728649,730870,types of potion you can brew as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,730870,733150,we've got some awkward potions and with
mS4Y_avaBWw,733150,735790,silver you can turn this into antidote
mS4Y_avaBWw,735790,740040,which will cure poison the next one has
mS4Y_avaBWw,740040,742930,Cobalts in its of all things and that
mS4Y_avaBWw,742930,745450,makes the elixir which can be used to
mS4Y_avaBWw,745450,748959,cure weakness we then have eyedrops made
mS4Y_avaBWw,748959,751690,with calcium and this will cure
mS4Y_avaBWw,751690,754060,blindness these are all effects in the
mS4Y_avaBWw,754060,755790,game of course we're talking about here
mS4Y_avaBWw,755790,758950,and then last of all we have bismuth
mS4Y_avaBWw,758950,761890,which makes this tonic right here which
mS4Y_avaBWw,761890,765100,can be used to cure nausea so those are
mS4Y_avaBWw,765100,766959,the four different types of potion you
mS4Y_avaBWw,766959,769750,can make with this stuff as well and now
mS4Y_avaBWw,769750,772240,my friends we get to have fun with the
mS4Y_avaBWw,772240,776050,contents of this box I'm going to start
mS4Y_avaBWw,776050,779829,off by cloning the box and then breaking
mS4Y_avaBWw,779829,782550,it if that lets make several clones
mS4Y_avaBWw,782550,784540,breaking it so we can get all the items
mS4Y_avaBWw,784540,786190,now the torches are probably going to be
mS4Y_avaBWw,786190,787779,the least interesting right because
mS4Y_avaBWw,787779,789370,they're not going to emit actual colored
mS4Y_avaBWw,789370,790810,light because that would require
mS4Y_avaBWw,790810,792940,changing the engine so it's literally
mS4Y_avaBWw,792940,795700,gonna be a different colored torch each
mS4Y_avaBWw,795700,798760,time one of these allows me to access my
mS4Y_avaBWw,798760,802310,inventory like survival mode so
mS4Y_avaBWw,802310,804350,there's the blue one there's the red one
mS4Y_avaBWw,804350,806329,we've got the underwater torch over here
mS4Y_avaBWw,806329,808759,so if we go down underwater funny enough
mS4Y_avaBWw,808759,810980,down to the bottom of the ocean where it
mS4Y_avaBWw,810980,813649,is dark and mysterious and look at that
mS4Y_avaBWw,813649,815870,Oh with particle effects as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,815870,819529,I like that ever so much that's really
mS4Y_avaBWw,819529,820339,really nice
mS4Y_avaBWw,820339,824689,it emits lights it's got a nice nice
mS4Y_avaBWw,824689,826730,effect as you move away from it as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,826730,828410,that's cool and of course it doesn't pop
mS4Y_avaBWw,828410,830749,off so that's interesting we're probably
mS4Y_avaBWw,830749,832009,going to need to give ourselves that
mS4Y_avaBWw,832009,833480,flint and steel for this next one
mS4Y_avaBWw,833480,836389,because I would like to let's put the
mS4Y_avaBWw,836389,838040,purple torch away I'd like to grab our
mS4Y_avaBWw,838040,842319,underwater TNT and place that down here
mS4Y_avaBWw,842319,846499,so water usually stops TNT from working
mS4Y_avaBWw,846499,849529,right so this time it's just TNT that
mS4Y_avaBWw,849529,851480,does work even when there's water going
mS4Y_avaBWw,851480,854089,into it let's use more than one block
mS4Y_avaBWw,854089,857809,let's put down quite a few and then move
mS4Y_avaBWw,857809,862759,away and there you go awesome stuff now
mS4Y_avaBWw,862759,864860,we have a glow stick that apparently
mS4Y_avaBWw,864860,866839,glows when it's shaken so if I hold down
mS4Y_avaBWw,866839,870019,right click we're shaking it and we've
mS4Y_avaBWw,870019,872059,used it a little bit is it sort of
mS4Y_avaBWw,872059,874959,active now I think it's kind of active
mS4Y_avaBWw,874959,877279,maybe we need to go down to where it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,877279,878899,darker I've never seen this stuff before
mS4Y_avaBWw,878899,881930,peeps okay so we can't shake it anymore
mS4Y_avaBWw,881930,885470,let's shake this one ah look at that the
mS4Y_avaBWw,885470,888589,stick is glowing that's cool and so's
mS4Y_avaBWw,888589,890000,that one actually I didn't really notice
mS4Y_avaBWw,890000,893269,did I so give it a little shake oh man
mS4Y_avaBWw,893269,896870,and now it's nice and visible so this
mS4Y_avaBWw,896870,898970,bleach that we got in our inventory is
mS4Y_avaBWw,898970,901730,simply used to remove dyes from stuff is
mS4Y_avaBWw,901730,904519,it a one-time use it is so that's
mS4Y_avaBWw,904519,906199,probably not worth messing around with
mS4Y_avaBWw,906199,908209,but you can convert colored stuff back
mS4Y_avaBWw,908209,910370,into normal stuff this next one we're
mS4Y_avaBWw,910370,913629,going to go into game mode survival and
mS4Y_avaBWw,913629,916129,I've never seen this screen before until
mS4Y_avaBWw,916129,919850,today it's really good I like it and now
mS4Y_avaBWw,919850,920749,we're gonna break the hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,920749,923480,which will take a fair bit longer than
mS4Y_avaBWw,923480,925639,usual as you can tell glass is usually
mS4Y_avaBWw,925639,927769,pretty quick to break do you know what
mS4Y_avaBWw,927769,929389,else we should do we should check and
mS4Y_avaBWw,929389,934339,see if it is TNT resistant there we go
mS4Y_avaBWw,934339,936080,I reckon it's not going
mS4Y_avaBWw,936080,939410,be that resistant oh it is well I spoke
mS4Y_avaBWw,939410,943600,too soon there you go interesting stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,943600,946760,ok I need me some some grass or some
mS4Y_avaBWw,946760,948590,dirt near some water we're gonna put
mS4Y_avaBWw,948590,950240,down some seeds and then we're gonna use
mS4Y_avaBWw,950240,952490,our super-duper fertilizer what was it
mS4Y_avaBWw,952490,953150,called again
mS4Y_avaBWw,953150,955340,super fertilizer I was pretty close
mS4Y_avaBWw,955340,957530,there's no duper and look at that
mS4Y_avaBWw,957530,959060,basically bone meal that goes all the
mS4Y_avaBWw,959060,961160,way to the fullest growth we should we
mS4Y_avaBWw,961160,963140,should try that on saplings for trees as
mS4Y_avaBWw,963140,965630,well and see if they will instantly grow
mS4Y_avaBWw,965630,968210,and under what conditions as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,968210,971750,let's go put like a sapling down just
mS4Y_avaBWw,971750,973310,over here and see if we can instantly
mS4Y_avaBWw,973310,976430,grow it we can fascinating what if there
mS4Y_avaBWw,976430,977990,are other blocks around it or other
mS4Y_avaBWw,977990,979880,trees is it gonna grow instantly every
mS4Y_avaBWw,979880,982580,time it is no not that time you saw it
mS4Y_avaBWw,982580,984830,there X is asking questions and finding
mS4Y_avaBWw,984830,987500,flaws with the super fertilizer so it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,987500,990080,not that super it's pretty strong but
mS4Y_avaBWw,990080,992510,not strong enough alright so the ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,992510,994910,bomb is supposed to turn water into ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,994910,997430,do we do we throw this oh yes it is a
mS4Y_avaBWw,997430,1000190,projectile that could be pretty fun for
mS4Y_avaBWw,1000190,1004150,minigames right so we can make ourselves
mS4Y_avaBWw,1004150,1006910,a little ice lake and then what we can
mS4Y_avaBWw,1006910,1009280,do is put down the heat block which
mS4Y_avaBWw,1009280,1011380,should start to melt the ice as well I
mS4Y_avaBWw,1011380,1013510,like the transparency of this and it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,1013510,1016390,animated as well so it says that like a
mS4Y_avaBWw,1016390,1019510,tortured or emit light and melt the ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,1019510,1021430,it could be the ice is created from the
mS4Y_avaBWw,1021430,1023830,ice bomb isn't the same type and
mS4Y_avaBWw,1023830,1025839,therefore it's not melting it Oh No
mS4Y_avaBWw,1025839,1027790,there we go it's it started to melt
mS4Y_avaBWw,1027790,1029230,there in the middle the first one that
mS4Y_avaBWw,1029230,1033280,we placed it's now melting so sometimes
mS4Y_avaBWw,1033280,1036189,they say save the best for last I've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,1036189,1037780,a feeling these sparklers are gonna be
mS4Y_avaBWw,1037780,1045850,the best it's right quick umm that's not
mS4Y_avaBWw,1045850,1047560,quite what I was expecting I was
mS4Y_avaBWw,1047560,1049390,thinking more particle effects although
mS4Y_avaBWw,1049390,1051130,we do get some that sort of follow us as
mS4Y_avaBWw,1051130,1052810,we move around how does that look like
mS4Y_avaBWw,1052810,1054940,in this right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,1054940,1056890,I like the fizzling noise that's cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,1056890,1060910,and is that slowly like burning out okay
mS4Y_avaBWw,1060910,1062860,interesting so our glow sticks well
mS4Y_avaBWw,1062860,1065410,actually now if I'm not holding it and I
mS4Y_avaBWw,1065410,1067210,go back to it it continues fizzling
mS4Y_avaBWw,1067210,1068850,right
mS4Y_avaBWw,1068850,1070470,and we know what the deal is now don't
mS4Y_avaBWw,1070470,1073590,we I should I should be dual wielding
mS4Y_avaBWw,1073590,1077510,this let's go let's go put one in there
mS4Y_avaBWw,1077510,1081630,got me some sparklers feets Wow that is
mS4Y_avaBWw,1081630,1086910,superb I love it awesome awesome stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,1086910,1089309,right well there it is it's been a very
mS4Y_avaBWw,1089309,1091289,interesting video we've gone through all
mS4Y_avaBWw,1091289,1093630,of the stuff in the chem lab if you have
mS4Y_avaBWw,1093630,1095370,enjoyed the video leave a like as always
mS4Y_avaBWw,1095370,1096990,thank you for the support and in the
mS4Y_avaBWw,1096990,1098460,description box down below you can find
mS4Y_avaBWw,1098460,1100559,the guide to the chemistry lab as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,1100559,1102750,if you'd like to look at that but anyway
mS4Y_avaBWw,1102750,1104400,that's it for me this video thank you
mS4Y_avaBWw,1104400,1108440,for watching I'll see you soon buh-bye
vid,start,end,text
mS4Y_avaBWw,30,2340,hello everyone and welcome back to
mS4Y_avaBWw,2340,4859,another minecraft update video we are
mS4Y_avaBWw,4859,6839,currently in bedrock edition this is
mS4Y_avaBWw,6839,8849,beta one point two point twenty point
mS4Y_avaBWw,8849,12500,one and in this edition you can enable
mS4Y_avaBWw,12500,15809,education edition and this unlocks the
mS4Y_avaBWw,15809,18840,chemistry lab which brings chemistry
mS4Y_avaBWw,18840,21449,into Minecraft now disclaimer alert I
mS4Y_avaBWw,21449,24570,was not taught this stuff at school so I
mS4Y_avaBWw,24570,26430,know what a periodic table is I have
mS4Y_avaBWw,26430,28170,actually built one using these blocks
mS4Y_avaBWw,28170,30630,which represent the different elements
mS4Y_avaBWw,30630,33540,in the periodic table so when it comes
mS4Y_avaBWw,33540,35460,to things being scientifically accurate
mS4Y_avaBWw,35460,37559,I'm not your guy unfortunately but I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,37559,38790,gonna walk you for all the things that
mS4Y_avaBWw,38790,41040,have been added with this and it is
mS4Y_avaBWw,41040,42989,pretty pretty fantastic pretty
mS4Y_avaBWw,42989,44520,interesting it comes with a lot of
mS4Y_avaBWw,44520,46800,practical uses in survival mode as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,46800,48960,there are items gonna change how you
mS4Y_avaBWw,48960,51360,play the game in survival minecraft but
mS4Y_avaBWw,51360,53579,if we scroll down here now those items
mS4Y_avaBWw,53579,56579,are actually accessible as you will see
mS4Y_avaBWw,56579,58559,we have all of the different elements of
mS4Y_avaBWw,58559,60390,the periodic table right here all of
mS4Y_avaBWw,60390,62160,these names so many of them are very
mS4Y_avaBWw,62160,65610,interesting and cool and that's all that
mS4Y_avaBWw,65610,67409,there appears to be but believe me there
mS4Y_avaBWw,67409,69840,is in fact more things to check out for
mS4Y_avaBWw,69840,72270,example there are sparklers underwater
mS4Y_avaBWw,72270,75450,TNT underwater torches hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,75450,78140,blocks and a super fertilizer to make
mS4Y_avaBWw,78140,80340,plants grow instantly those are just
mS4Y_avaBWw,80340,81720,some of the things that have been added
mS4Y_avaBWw,81720,83280,and we're gonna check out every single
mS4Y_avaBWw,83280,85860,thing that's been added with this I will
mS4Y_avaBWw,85860,87479,open this chest and show you a couple of
mS4Y_avaBWw,87479,89729,examples there is some elixir right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,89729,92130,which can cure blindness if I remember
mS4Y_avaBWw,92130,94020,correctly we'll go over that again later
mS4Y_avaBWw,94020,95729,and I'll tell you exactly what it is
mS4Y_avaBWw,95729,97829,that it does we've also got these red
mS4Y_avaBWw,97829,99540,balloons which are filled up with helium
mS4Y_avaBWw,99540,102509,so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,102509,105360,spawn a pig and then I'm going to attach
mS4Y_avaBWw,105360,107340,the balloon to the pig and the pig is
mS4Y_avaBWw,107340,109560,going to go off into the sky you know
mS4Y_avaBWw,109560,112979,real practical uses peeps that's a very
mS4Y_avaBWw,112979,115890,practical use it's gone it's literally
mS4Y_avaBWw,115890,117719,gone I I want to do that a couple more
mS4Y_avaBWw,117719,121909,times oh wow don't run away just yet
mS4Y_avaBWw,121909,124619,look at that we're making pigs fly oh
mS4Y_avaBWw,124619,127429,they go up this so quickly don't they
mS4Y_avaBWw,127429,129720,now if you're watching this video and
mS4Y_avaBWw,129720,131550,you're part of the beta of the bedrock
mS4Y_avaBWw,131550,133170,edition you might be thinking I want to
mS4Y_avaBWw,133170,133920,check this out
mS4Y_avaBWw,133920,135690,self and I'll show you exactly how you
mS4Y_avaBWw,135690,138270,go about doing that you need to create a
mS4Y_avaBWw,138270,140130,new weld and then in the options for
mS4Y_avaBWw,140130,141180,creating a new world you need to
mS4Y_avaBWw,141180,143540,activate cheats and then simply select
mS4Y_avaBWw,143540,145680,education edition and this is gonna add
mS4Y_avaBWw,145680,148170,the chemistry lab to your game now if
mS4Y_avaBWw,148170,149580,you're thinking I want to know how to be
mS4Y_avaBWw,149580,152190,a part of the beta that is something I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,152190,153750,not gonna tell you in this video because
mS4Y_avaBWw,153750,155910,it was a huge pain in the butt for me to
mS4Y_avaBWw,155910,158610,actually get into the beta and to get it
mS4Y_avaBWw,158610,160350,working and it's not the sort of thing I
mS4Y_avaBWw,160350,161940,can make a tutorial on but you can go
mS4Y_avaBWw,161940,163530,look up other guides and if you run into
mS4Y_avaBWw,163530,165569,problems you will know the headache that
mS4Y_avaBWw,165569,167670,I went through to get this to work but
mS4Y_avaBWw,167670,169830,anyway let's go and jump back into our
mS4Y_avaBWw,169830,170420,world
mS4Y_avaBWw,170420,173760,so we shall start by checking out two of
mS4Y_avaBWw,173760,176519,these blocks the first one is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,176519,179400,element constructor and look at these
mS4Y_avaBWw,179400,180959,textures man I love that it's got a
mS4Y_avaBWw,180959,183239,unique texture on each side these blocks
mS4Y_avaBWw,183239,185670,are extremely cool we have the material
mS4Y_avaBWw,185670,187140,reducer as well we're gonna check that
mS4Y_avaBWw,187140,189120,one out second so let's go and open up
mS4Y_avaBWw,189120,191220,the element constructor this is gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,191220,194640,require no power no items being put into
mS4Y_avaBWw,194640,196049,it it's basically going to give you
mS4Y_avaBWw,196049,197790,stuff for free what you have to do is
mS4Y_avaBWw,197790,201060,configure the elements and you do that
mS4Y_avaBWw,201060,202769,by telling it the amount of protons
mS4Y_avaBWw,202769,205410,electrons and neutrons that are going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,205410,207510,go into this so let's start by adding a
mS4Y_avaBWw,207510,210239,proton and an electron and we've created
mS4Y_avaBWw,210239,212519,the very first element which is hydrogen
mS4Y_avaBWw,212519,215040,and I can simply just you know drag that
mS4Y_avaBWw,215040,216840,over and over again probably can shift
mS4Y_avaBWw,216840,219120,drag it for a stack no you can just take
mS4Y_avaBWw,219120,220950,one at a time but that's all you have to
mS4Y_avaBWw,220950,222780,do it's pretty cool stuff now let's go
mS4Y_avaBWw,222780,224190,ahead and make the second one which is
mS4Y_avaBWw,224190,227250,helium so if I go and add one extra
mS4Y_avaBWw,227250,230280,proton one extra electron and a nutrient
mS4Y_avaBWw,230280,232410,we get helium like that it's pretty cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,232410,232739,right
mS4Y_avaBWw,232739,235440,the third one is lithium which is free
mS4Y_avaBWw,235440,238650,of each and there you go we are making
mS4Y_avaBWw,238650,240450,the elements now you'll notice the
mS4Y_avaBWw,240450,242130,electrons have these rings around
mS4Y_avaBWw,242130,243989,outside are going to guess this is all
mS4Y_avaBWw,243989,246180,scientifically correct it would make
mS4Y_avaBWw,246180,247950,sense that it is because education
mS4Y_avaBWw,247950,249180,edition I don't think they're going to
mS4Y_avaBWw,249180,253010,half-ass anything here that is extremely
mS4Y_avaBWw,253010,255810,peculiar and interesting to me and so is
mS4Y_avaBWw,255810,258090,all of this but as we as we drag them
mS4Y_avaBWw,258090,259769,around randomly you see it's kind of
mS4Y_avaBWw,259769,262409,tricky to land on the correct one so
mS4Y_avaBWw,262409,264539,let's go and do one with a different
mS4Y_avaBWw,264539,266310,amount you can also click up here for
mS4Y_avaBWw,266310,267450,example if
mS4Y_avaBWw,267450,271230,I set this to 42 this one here to 42 as
mS4Y_avaBWw,271230,274440,well and then that one to 50 we should
mS4Y_avaBWw,274440,279630,create moly bdellium oh yeah these these
mS4Y_avaBWw,279630,282300,things start to have a crazy names let's
mS4Y_avaBWw,282300,284520,go make Ron diem if we put this up to
mS4Y_avaBWw,284520,288200,five on each and then it's 58 I believe
mS4Y_avaBWw,288200,292050,58 of those makes Ron diem I'm in and
mS4Y_avaBWw,292050,293490,you can make all of the different
mS4Y_avaBWw,293490,295980,elements of the periodic table over
mS4Y_avaBWw,295980,297360,there using this thing pretty
mS4Y_avaBWw,297360,299400,fascinating right now there is another
mS4Y_avaBWw,299400,301650,way to obtain these items as well if I
mS4Y_avaBWw,301650,303570,just go in here and grab a couple of
mS4Y_avaBWw,303570,304590,random items
mS4Y_avaBWw,304590,307230,let's grab some sand from down here as
mS4Y_avaBWw,307230,310110,well and we go over to this block which
mS4Y_avaBWw,310110,312360,is the material reducer we will be able
mS4Y_avaBWw,312360,314910,to reduce materials to there the
mS4Y_avaBWw,314910,317670,elements so this could be like entirely
mS4Y_avaBWw,317670,321060,accurate certain amounts of oxygen and
mS4Y_avaBWw,321060,323340,silicon makes sand I know this silicon
mS4Y_avaBWw,323340,325520,in sound that sounds like a legit thing
mS4Y_avaBWw,325520,330480,okay so brick blocks no stone bricks no
mS4Y_avaBWw,330480,332310,I'm guessing that one no as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,332310,334380,maybe we need things that are a little
mS4Y_avaBWw,334380,336960,bit more natural for example dirts
mS4Y_avaBWw,336960,339410,perhaps grass would make sense as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,339410,342330,my friends I have discovered the errors
mS4Y_avaBWw,342330,344880,of my ways I have been putting in stacks
mS4Y_avaBWw,344880,347910,instead of single blocks if we look at
mS4Y_avaBWw,347910,349610,what makes up this carbon oxygen
mS4Y_avaBWw,349610,352200,nitrogen not even going to try to say
mS4Y_avaBWw,352200,353940,that one right there we can see what
mS4Y_avaBWw,353940,356640,makes up dirt block as well but not a
mS4Y_avaBWw,356640,359580,lot of blocks actually go into here for
mS4Y_avaBWw,359580,362430,example if I try orange stain glass not
mS4Y_avaBWw,362430,364620,having much luck maybe regular glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,364620,367740,would have been a better try so let's go
mS4Y_avaBWw,367740,371460,down here and slap one of those in no
mS4Y_avaBWw,371460,373140,doesn't accept it anyway that is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,373140,374460,other way that you can get yourself some
mS4Y_avaBWw,374460,377340,of these elements let's now check out
mS4Y_avaBWw,377340,379140,the next block right here this is the
mS4Y_avaBWw,379140,381810,compound create a man that texture is so
mS4Y_avaBWw,381810,382230,cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,382230,384210,allow this over so much we can use this
mS4Y_avaBWw,384210,385830,to take some of those elements and
mS4Y_avaBWw,385830,388230,combine them to create other things like
mS4Y_avaBWw,388230,390600,Minecraft items like charcoal ink and
mS4Y_avaBWw,390600,392490,sugar can all be made in this and then a
mS4Y_avaBWw,392490,394320,whole bunch of other crazy items as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,394320,396030,which we can use to craft some of the
mS4Y_avaBWw,396030,397560,cool stuff I'm going to be showing you
mS4Y_avaBWw,397560,400500,at the end of this video so we're gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,400500,401400,start off by do
mS4Y_avaBWw,401400,404220,is chucking in one sodium and one
mS4Y_avaBWw,404220,405990,chlorine and this is going to create
mS4Y_avaBWw,405990,410160,salt as you can see NAC oh it shows you
mS4Y_avaBWw,410160,412740,it right there we just we just made some
mS4Y_avaBWw,412740,414210,salt I've got no idea if there's any
mS4Y_avaBWw,414210,415680,uses for this and apparently I can take
mS4Y_avaBWw,415680,417180,as much as I want and then put those
mS4Y_avaBWw,417180,419370,back that's very cool now sometimes
mS4Y_avaBWw,419370,421770,you're going to need more than just once
mS4Y_avaBWw,421770,423540,if I to put in one carbon and one
mS4Y_avaBWw,423540,425490,hydrogen we don't get anything but if I
mS4Y_avaBWw,425490,428190,put in nine carbon and 20 hydrogen we
mS4Y_avaBWw,428190,431370,get ourselves some crude oil and notice
mS4Y_avaBWw,431370,433919,again it's the C and the H and then the
mS4Y_avaBWw,433919,436139,amounts that we have and I could take as
mS4Y_avaBWw,436139,439050,much crude oil as I want ah this is this
mS4Y_avaBWw,439050,441210,is insane right here so then we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,441210,443639,some iron and some sulfur to make some
mS4Y_avaBWw,443639,446340,iron sulphide ah crazy look at these
mS4Y_avaBWw,446340,447990,little items right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,447990,450389,they look very interesting and then
mS4Y_avaBWw,450389,453180,we've got six carbon and six hydrogen to
mS4Y_avaBWw,453180,455760,make benzene I think that's how you say
mS4Y_avaBWw,455760,457740,that one now not all of them require
mS4Y_avaBWw,457740,459960,just two things and you can sort of put
mS4Y_avaBWw,459960,462240,them in I believe anywhere as long as
mS4Y_avaBWw,462240,464760,they're in there together right so order
mS4Y_avaBWw,464760,466410,and stuff is not too much of a problem I
mS4Y_avaBWw,466410,467910,got one down the bottom here that
mS4Y_avaBWw,467910,470130,requires four we've got carbon we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,470130,473460,hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen or with
mS4Y_avaBWw,473460,474990,different amounts and you can put it
mS4Y_avaBWw,474990,478680,together to make luminol don't even know
mS4Y_avaBWw,478680,480090,what this stuff is but it but I'm
mS4Y_avaBWw,480090,483990,excited by it and now we have the lab
mS4Y_avaBWw,483990,487139,table time for some mandatory inspection
mS4Y_avaBWw,487139,489419,of all sides of the block well not the
mS4Y_avaBWw,489419,492180,bottom side but just like those textures
mS4Y_avaBWw,492180,494340,leave me alone in here you can put
mS4Y_avaBWw,494340,495780,together some of the things you saw us
mS4Y_avaBWw,495780,498660,craft in just a moment ago and and
mS4Y_avaBWw,498660,500760,combine those things to make other items
mS4Y_avaBWw,500760,503099,of which free of these I think are
mS4Y_avaBWw,503099,504990,actually really useful in survival well
mS4Y_avaBWw,504990,507510,at least they have a use if we go into
mS4Y_avaBWw,507510,509099,here though and just quickly create some
mS4Y_avaBWw,509099,511800,a manoa hopefully I'm saying that
mS4Y_avaBWw,511800,513779,correctly I'm sorry if I'm not and we
mS4Y_avaBWw,513779,515849,mix these two things together we should
mS4Y_avaBWw,515849,517229,be able to combine that into something
mS4Y_avaBWw,517229,519330,now that just started to animate after I
mS4Y_avaBWw,519330,522029,put in that other item right so perhaps
mS4Y_avaBWw,522029,524730,that's showing you when you're doing st.
mS4Y_avaBWw,524730,527339,corrects and maybe each of these
mS4Y_avaBWw,527339,529170,different types animate depending on
mS4Y_avaBWw,529170,530910,what type of thing you're creating but
mS4Y_avaBWw,530910,534089,if I combine wow I was not expecting
mS4Y_avaBWw,534089,535260,that
mS4Y_avaBWw,535260,538170,we've got ourselves some super
mS4Y_avaBWw,538170,539670,fertilizer now here's what we're gonna
mS4Y_avaBWw,539670,541650,do we're gonna put that over to one side
mS4Y_avaBWw,541650,543930,in a chest and we'll be checking it out
mS4Y_avaBWw,543930,546990,at the end of this video there is more
mS4Y_avaBWw,546990,549120,to be made though first of all we've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,549120,551630,to make water and this one's a classic
mS4Y_avaBWw,551630,555390,h2o and there it is so we've got some
mS4Y_avaBWw,555390,557850,water and these things together should
mS4Y_avaBWw,557850,560310,make us a heat block of all things so
mS4Y_avaBWw,560310,562590,let's just chuck them in there and then
mS4Y_avaBWw,562590,565080,see what it says aha look this one on
mS4Y_avaBWw,565080,567420,this side now animates oh that is so
mS4Y_avaBWw,567420,569310,very cool by the way there are only four
mS4Y_avaBWw,569310,571230,things you can make in here as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,571230,572460,hopefully we will see that middle one
mS4Y_avaBWw,572460,575070,get animated as well and different
mS4Y_avaBWw,575070,577730,particle effects this time that was
mS4Y_avaBWw,577730,581810,fantastic and we now have the heat lock
mS4Y_avaBWw,581810,583740,we're gonna put it in here for later
mS4Y_avaBWw,583740,587910,peeps we're making some more stuff it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,587910,591960,sodium Act eight this time and we need
mS4Y_avaBWw,591960,594240,four of it to go into here to make an
mS4Y_avaBWw,594240,596250,ice bomb of all things there's the
mS4Y_avaBWw,596250,598760,animation let's click combined and
mS4Y_avaBWw,598760,602940,particle effects now it's time for a
mS4Y_avaBWw,602940,605450,little bit of water and the old sodium
mS4Y_avaBWw,605450,607800,hypochlorite let's just go tuck that in
mS4Y_avaBWw,607800,609750,there and we've got this animation over
mS4Y_avaBWw,609750,611130,here so there are four different things
mS4Y_avaBWw,611130,613320,you can make and we haven't seen the
mS4Y_avaBWw,613320,615450,middle one animates but anyway particle
mS4Y_avaBWw,615450,617820,effects time that was really cool and
mS4Y_avaBWw,617820,621540,we've made ourselves some bleach so for
mS4Y_avaBWw,621540,623370,the next set of items we have to do a
mS4Y_avaBWw,623370,625050,whole bunch of crafting so let's start
mS4Y_avaBWw,625050,626850,off with some of the easiest stuff first
mS4Y_avaBWw,626850,630630,of all TNT mixed with sodium makes
mS4Y_avaBWw,630630,634290,underwater TNT and then magnesium and
mS4Y_avaBWw,634290,637740,torches makes underwater torches again
mS4Y_avaBWw,637740,640950,we're gonna check these out later on so
mS4Y_avaBWw,640950,643080,using the compound creator I've made a
mS4Y_avaBWw,643080,645450,bunch of different types of chlorides
mS4Y_avaBWw,645450,647970,and now what we can do is combine those
mS4Y_avaBWw,647970,649650,chlorides with other items
mS4Y_avaBWw,649650,652200,first of all torches to make color
mS4Y_avaBWw,652200,655350,torches so that gives us a blue torch we
mS4Y_avaBWw,655350,658920,can get a red torch a purple torch and
mS4Y_avaBWw,658920,662370,last of all a green torch awesome and
mS4Y_avaBWw,662370,664950,then the other thing we can do is put
mS4Y_avaBWw,664950,666930,sticks magnesium and then each of these
mS4Y_avaBWw,666930,668680,chlorides on top of it to create
mS4Y_avaBWw,668680,670300,sparklers are different colors so we've
mS4Y_avaBWw,670300,672520,got orange and then these are just like
mS4Y_avaBWw,672520,673870,the other ones this one's gonna be red
mS4Y_avaBWw,673870,675690,isn't it yes so they kind of match
mS4Y_avaBWw,675690,678910,purple and last of all it will be green
mS4Y_avaBWw,678910,681820,yes awesome okay so we made some
mS4Y_avaBWw,681820,684339,sparklers and torches and and you know
mS4Y_avaBWw,684339,685510,we're gonna we're gonna check it out
mS4Y_avaBWw,685510,689070,later on and now for the last of our
mS4Y_avaBWw,689070,691450,crafting we can make hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,691450,694120,which simply takes longer to break
mS4Y_avaBWw,694120,695950,that's all there is to it
mS4Y_avaBWw,695950,698620,you need some aluminium oxide and some
mS4Y_avaBWw,698620,702160,boron trioxide and then it makes
mS4Y_avaBWw,702160,704560,hardened glass which I gotta say looks
mS4Y_avaBWw,704560,707410,seriously cool here's another thing you
mS4Y_avaBWw,707410,710050,can make with this polyethylene stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,710050,712600,and don't tell me I didn't actually make
mS4Y_avaBWw,712600,714100,enough apparently I didn't make enough
mS4Y_avaBWw,714100,716470,overall I did make the right amount I
mS4Y_avaBWw,716470,719410,was just missing something so if we do
mS4Y_avaBWw,719410,722830,that's look at that an orange glow stick
mS4Y_avaBWw,722830,725950,let's make a purple one and a cyan one
mS4Y_avaBWw,725950,728649,as well so there are four different
mS4Y_avaBWw,728649,730870,types of potion you can brew as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,730870,733150,we've got some awkward potions and with
mS4Y_avaBWw,733150,735790,silver you can turn this into antidote
mS4Y_avaBWw,735790,740040,which will cure poison the next one has
mS4Y_avaBWw,740040,742930,Cobalts in its of all things and that
mS4Y_avaBWw,742930,745450,makes the elixir which can be used to
mS4Y_avaBWw,745450,748959,cure weakness we then have eyedrops made
mS4Y_avaBWw,748959,751690,with calcium and this will cure
mS4Y_avaBWw,751690,754060,blindness these are all effects in the
mS4Y_avaBWw,754060,755790,game of course we're talking about here
mS4Y_avaBWw,755790,758950,and then last of all we have bismuth
mS4Y_avaBWw,758950,761890,which makes this tonic right here which
mS4Y_avaBWw,761890,765100,can be used to cure nausea so those are
mS4Y_avaBWw,765100,766959,the four different types of potion you
mS4Y_avaBWw,766959,769750,can make with this stuff as well and now
mS4Y_avaBWw,769750,772240,my friends we get to have fun with the
mS4Y_avaBWw,772240,776050,contents of this box I'm going to start
mS4Y_avaBWw,776050,779829,off by cloning the box and then breaking
mS4Y_avaBWw,779829,782550,it if that lets make several clones
mS4Y_avaBWw,782550,784540,breaking it so we can get all the items
mS4Y_avaBWw,784540,786190,now the torches are probably going to be
mS4Y_avaBWw,786190,787779,the least interesting right because
mS4Y_avaBWw,787779,789370,they're not going to emit actual colored
mS4Y_avaBWw,789370,790810,light because that would require
mS4Y_avaBWw,790810,792940,changing the engine so it's literally
mS4Y_avaBWw,792940,795700,gonna be a different colored torch each
mS4Y_avaBWw,795700,798760,time one of these allows me to access my
mS4Y_avaBWw,798760,802310,inventory like survival mode so
mS4Y_avaBWw,802310,804350,there's the blue one there's the red one
mS4Y_avaBWw,804350,806329,we've got the underwater torch over here
mS4Y_avaBWw,806329,808759,so if we go down underwater funny enough
mS4Y_avaBWw,808759,810980,down to the bottom of the ocean where it
mS4Y_avaBWw,810980,813649,is dark and mysterious and look at that
mS4Y_avaBWw,813649,815870,Oh with particle effects as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,815870,819529,I like that ever so much that's really
mS4Y_avaBWw,819529,820339,really nice
mS4Y_avaBWw,820339,824689,it emits lights it's got a nice nice
mS4Y_avaBWw,824689,826730,effect as you move away from it as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,826730,828410,that's cool and of course it doesn't pop
mS4Y_avaBWw,828410,830749,off so that's interesting we're probably
mS4Y_avaBWw,830749,832009,going to need to give ourselves that
mS4Y_avaBWw,832009,833480,flint and steel for this next one
mS4Y_avaBWw,833480,836389,because I would like to let's put the
mS4Y_avaBWw,836389,838040,purple torch away I'd like to grab our
mS4Y_avaBWw,838040,842319,underwater TNT and place that down here
mS4Y_avaBWw,842319,846499,so water usually stops TNT from working
mS4Y_avaBWw,846499,849529,right so this time it's just TNT that
mS4Y_avaBWw,849529,851480,does work even when there's water going
mS4Y_avaBWw,851480,854089,into it let's use more than one block
mS4Y_avaBWw,854089,857809,let's put down quite a few and then move
mS4Y_avaBWw,857809,862759,away and there you go awesome stuff now
mS4Y_avaBWw,862759,864860,we have a glow stick that apparently
mS4Y_avaBWw,864860,866839,glows when it's shaken so if I hold down
mS4Y_avaBWw,866839,870019,right click we're shaking it and we've
mS4Y_avaBWw,870019,872059,used it a little bit is it sort of
mS4Y_avaBWw,872059,874959,active now I think it's kind of active
mS4Y_avaBWw,874959,877279,maybe we need to go down to where it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,877279,878899,darker I've never seen this stuff before
mS4Y_avaBWw,878899,881930,peeps okay so we can't shake it anymore
mS4Y_avaBWw,881930,885470,let's shake this one ah look at that the
mS4Y_avaBWw,885470,888589,stick is glowing that's cool and so's
mS4Y_avaBWw,888589,890000,that one actually I didn't really notice
mS4Y_avaBWw,890000,893269,did I so give it a little shake oh man
mS4Y_avaBWw,893269,896870,and now it's nice and visible so this
mS4Y_avaBWw,896870,898970,bleach that we got in our inventory is
mS4Y_avaBWw,898970,901730,simply used to remove dyes from stuff is
mS4Y_avaBWw,901730,904519,it a one-time use it is so that's
mS4Y_avaBWw,904519,906199,probably not worth messing around with
mS4Y_avaBWw,906199,908209,but you can convert colored stuff back
mS4Y_avaBWw,908209,910370,into normal stuff this next one we're
mS4Y_avaBWw,910370,913629,going to go into game mode survival and
mS4Y_avaBWw,913629,916129,I've never seen this screen before until
mS4Y_avaBWw,916129,919850,today it's really good I like it and now
mS4Y_avaBWw,919850,920749,we're gonna break the hardened glass
mS4Y_avaBWw,920749,923480,which will take a fair bit longer than
mS4Y_avaBWw,923480,925639,usual as you can tell glass is usually
mS4Y_avaBWw,925639,927769,pretty quick to break do you know what
mS4Y_avaBWw,927769,929389,else we should do we should check and
mS4Y_avaBWw,929389,934339,see if it is TNT resistant there we go
mS4Y_avaBWw,934339,936080,I reckon it's not going
mS4Y_avaBWw,936080,939410,be that resistant oh it is well I spoke
mS4Y_avaBWw,939410,943600,too soon there you go interesting stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,943600,946760,ok I need me some some grass or some
mS4Y_avaBWw,946760,948590,dirt near some water we're gonna put
mS4Y_avaBWw,948590,950240,down some seeds and then we're gonna use
mS4Y_avaBWw,950240,952490,our super-duper fertilizer what was it
mS4Y_avaBWw,952490,953150,called again
mS4Y_avaBWw,953150,955340,super fertilizer I was pretty close
mS4Y_avaBWw,955340,957530,there's no duper and look at that
mS4Y_avaBWw,957530,959060,basically bone meal that goes all the
mS4Y_avaBWw,959060,961160,way to the fullest growth we should we
mS4Y_avaBWw,961160,963140,should try that on saplings for trees as
mS4Y_avaBWw,963140,965630,well and see if they will instantly grow
mS4Y_avaBWw,965630,968210,and under what conditions as well so
mS4Y_avaBWw,968210,971750,let's go put like a sapling down just
mS4Y_avaBWw,971750,973310,over here and see if we can instantly
mS4Y_avaBWw,973310,976430,grow it we can fascinating what if there
mS4Y_avaBWw,976430,977990,are other blocks around it or other
mS4Y_avaBWw,977990,979880,trees is it gonna grow instantly every
mS4Y_avaBWw,979880,982580,time it is no not that time you saw it
mS4Y_avaBWw,982580,984830,there X is asking questions and finding
mS4Y_avaBWw,984830,987500,flaws with the super fertilizer so it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,987500,990080,not that super it's pretty strong but
mS4Y_avaBWw,990080,992510,not strong enough alright so the ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,992510,994910,bomb is supposed to turn water into ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,994910,997430,do we do we throw this oh yes it is a
mS4Y_avaBWw,997430,1000190,projectile that could be pretty fun for
mS4Y_avaBWw,1000190,1004150,minigames right so we can make ourselves
mS4Y_avaBWw,1004150,1006910,a little ice lake and then what we can
mS4Y_avaBWw,1006910,1009280,do is put down the heat block which
mS4Y_avaBWw,1009280,1011380,should start to melt the ice as well I
mS4Y_avaBWw,1011380,1013510,like the transparency of this and it's
mS4Y_avaBWw,1013510,1016390,animated as well so it says that like a
mS4Y_avaBWw,1016390,1019510,tortured or emit light and melt the ice
mS4Y_avaBWw,1019510,1021430,it could be the ice is created from the
mS4Y_avaBWw,1021430,1023830,ice bomb isn't the same type and
mS4Y_avaBWw,1023830,1025839,therefore it's not melting it Oh No
mS4Y_avaBWw,1025839,1027790,there we go it's it started to melt
mS4Y_avaBWw,1027790,1029230,there in the middle the first one that
mS4Y_avaBWw,1029230,1033280,we placed it's now melting so sometimes
mS4Y_avaBWw,1033280,1036189,they say save the best for last I've got
mS4Y_avaBWw,1036189,1037780,a feeling these sparklers are gonna be
mS4Y_avaBWw,1037780,1045850,the best it's right quick umm that's not
mS4Y_avaBWw,1045850,1047560,quite what I was expecting I was
mS4Y_avaBWw,1047560,1049390,thinking more particle effects although
mS4Y_avaBWw,1049390,1051130,we do get some that sort of follow us as
mS4Y_avaBWw,1051130,1052810,we move around how does that look like
mS4Y_avaBWw,1052810,1054940,in this right here
mS4Y_avaBWw,1054940,1056890,I like the fizzling noise that's cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,1056890,1060910,and is that slowly like burning out okay
mS4Y_avaBWw,1060910,1062860,interesting so our glow sticks well
mS4Y_avaBWw,1062860,1065410,actually now if I'm not holding it and I
mS4Y_avaBWw,1065410,1067210,go back to it it continues fizzling
mS4Y_avaBWw,1067210,1068850,right
mS4Y_avaBWw,1068850,1070470,and we know what the deal is now don't
mS4Y_avaBWw,1070470,1073590,we I should I should be dual wielding
mS4Y_avaBWw,1073590,1077510,this let's go let's go put one in there
mS4Y_avaBWw,1077510,1081630,got me some sparklers feets Wow that is
mS4Y_avaBWw,1081630,1086910,superb I love it awesome awesome stuff
mS4Y_avaBWw,1086910,1089309,right well there it is it's been a very
mS4Y_avaBWw,1089309,1091289,interesting video we've gone through all
mS4Y_avaBWw,1091289,1093630,of the stuff in the chem lab if you have
mS4Y_avaBWw,1093630,1095370,enjoyed the video leave a like as always
mS4Y_avaBWw,1095370,1096990,thank you for the support and in the
mS4Y_avaBWw,1096990,1098460,description box down below you can find
mS4Y_avaBWw,1098460,1100559,the guide to the chemistry lab as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,1100559,1102750,if you'd like to look at that but anyway
mS4Y_avaBWw,1102750,1104400,that's it for me this video thank you
mS4Y_avaBWw,1104400,1108440,for watching I'll see you soon buh-bye
