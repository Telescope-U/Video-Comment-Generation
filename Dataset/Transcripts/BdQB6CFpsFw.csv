BdQB6CFpsFw,400,6480,[Music]  standing on that ledge
BdQB6CFpsFw,6480,13360,staring out at what we know we need to  do  at the moment we least want to do it
BdQB6CFpsFw,13360,20480,well that's where the future is shaped  when procrastination feels like the
BdQB6CFpsFw,20480,28160,answer or avoidance the optimal choice  where does one draw their strength
BdQB6CFpsFw,28160,33520,they say routine is a powerful tool in  this fight and i believe that when
BdQB6CFpsFw,33520,38879,something becomes habit or part of the  process  instilled in the day-to-day there's just
BdQB6CFpsFw,38879,46079,simply less room for negotiation  we show up with our eyes on the prize
BdQB6CFpsFw,46079,51120,but here's the thing  we are  human
BdQB6CFpsFw,51120,58719,there's simply going to be days when the  world pushes back  life is a game of complexity it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,58719,65040,unpredictable  you want to talk about the good days  fine it's easy to show up
BdQB6CFpsFw,65040,71439,when we're feeling good  and thankfully those days outnumber the  others right creating the bulk
BdQB6CFpsFw,71439,78960,of our consistency ten thousand hours  but not all of them
BdQB6CFpsFw,78960,84880,my life is about momentum  myself  after coming off a
BdQB6CFpsFw,84880,90320,pretty terrible weekend for a variety of  reasons i found myself on that ledge
BdQB6CFpsFw,90320,97360,again  when the alternative route made itself  known where it felt mighty tempting to
BdQB6CFpsFw,97360,103200,call it off  take a break where my world view had  come into question
BdQB6CFpsFw,103200,108640,i had to ask myself  who are you  really
BdQB6CFpsFw,108640,114758,it's easy to rationalize walking away in  these moments
BdQB6CFpsFw,116000,123439,in his book the war of art  stephen pressfield says  our job in life is not to shape
BdQB6CFpsFw,123439,129200,ourselves into some ideal we imagine we  ought to be but to find out who we
BdQB6CFpsFw,129200,135840,already are and become it  well who would have known
BdQB6CFpsFw,135840,141840,how much goes into that process of  becoming  how committed we have to be to the road
BdQB6CFpsFw,141840,149920,before us and not only when it's sunny  but when the skies are dark and gray
BdQB6CFpsFw,149920,157280,and how if we allow ourselves in those  difficult moments to say  sometimes it's okay to wave the white
BdQB6CFpsFw,157280,163360,flag  it's okay to walk away  then you leave the door cracked
BdQB6CFpsFw,163360,171280,to make that same decision at any other  point in time  right quitting conceding can very easily
BdQB6CFpsFw,171280,176879,become a habit  and a habit we want to avoid at all cost
BdQB6CFpsFw,176879,183280,right i have this uh  little rule that no matter what  i can never leave dishes in the sink
BdQB6CFpsFw,183280,189760,overnight never  i treat this you know arbitrary little  promise to myself like it's life or
BdQB6CFpsFw,189760,196800,death  which again random but hear me out it's  half practical half symbolic
BdQB6CFpsFw,196800,203440,i know that if i say  okay just this once  i've effectively removed the barrier
BdQB6CFpsFw,203440,209040,separating order from chaos  if it's okay just this once then it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,209040,214560,okay one thousand times  in a messy sink becomes a messy kitchen
BdQB6CFpsFw,214560,221760,becomes a messy house becomes a  cluttered mind  extreme maybe
BdQB6CFpsFw,221760,229200,but critical  right here is where the symbolism comes  in i understand how fragile that divide
BdQB6CFpsFw,229200,236480,how when i'm tired or have a headache or  i'm busy  it's still priority
BdQB6CFpsFw,236480,242640,because i want to hammer my subconscious  with the understanding that i show up  when it's inconvenient
BdQB6CFpsFw,242640,249040,that very moment when you know i could  easily trick myself into thinking it's  small or dumb or arbitrary it's a sink
BdQB6CFpsFw,249040,255760,who cares right that's the moment that i  need to bleed into the rest of my life
BdQB6CFpsFw,255760,260880,and i think that's exactly it right the  flood waters are always looking to come
BdQB6CFpsFw,260880,266320,in  and how many cracks  until the room gives way
BdQB6CFpsFw,266320,272880,you know when you've had a few rough  days  when you've lost something important to  you when you're sad or disappointed
BdQB6CFpsFw,272880,278080,about an outcome what then  when life calls you to exceed
BdQB6CFpsFw,278080,283759,expectations what then  because the world around you will always
BdQB6CFpsFw,283759,288960,give you evidence to support dialing it  back right selling yourself short if
BdQB6CFpsFw,288960,294320,that's the case you're looking to make  but here's the deal should you choose
BdQB6CFpsFw,294320,299680,the inverse you are strong enough to be  better than you've ever been
BdQB6CFpsFw,299680,305680,in those challenging moments  you can show up when it hurts you can
BdQB6CFpsFw,305680,312160,re-establish your why and carry forward  even after the turbulence of yesterday
BdQB6CFpsFw,312160,318320,life will never be easy  it will never all make sense  and this understanding
BdQB6CFpsFw,318320,323840,has helped me  to roll up my sleeves and continue
BdQB6CFpsFw,323840,330639,when i'm disappointed with yesterday or  overwhelmed by the conditions or  landscape of the moment
BdQB6CFpsFw,330639,336720,when i question how much i have left  but i've found that
BdQB6CFpsFw,336720,342639,when i look hard enough there's always  something to draw
BdQB6CFpsFw,343600,350880,and that's the message of note  that's what we must show ourselves
BdQB6CFpsFw,351039,358639,when you're on that ledge  this can be where you're at your best
BdQB6CFpsFw,358639,364560,this is where you get to uncover just  how deep rooted your greatness is this
BdQB6CFpsFw,364560,371120,is where you set the standard and the  pace  for everything
BdQB6CFpsFw,371120,374280,to come
BdQB6CFpsFw,386400,393280,can life change in a day  well what if we made today
BdQB6CFpsFw,393280,398639,a day of action  of being decisive of promising ourselves
BdQB6CFpsFw,398639,404319,that our goal or objective  is to make a single
BdQB6CFpsFw,404319,410479,move  however small  what if today
BdQB6CFpsFw,410479,416479,action is king  [Music]  and we live by the notion that
BdQB6CFpsFw,416479,423280,whether the result of our courage is  good or bad  whether it's the result we hoped for the
BdQB6CFpsFw,423280,428400,one that we didn't  at least  now
BdQB6CFpsFw,428400,433840,we have something to work off of  and that means we've moved beyond where
BdQB6CFpsFw,433840,440400,we started  what if today we live by the notion that
BdQB6CFpsFw,440400,448000,a vision can change our lives  but a vision without that small step
BdQB6CFpsFw,448000,453599,is powerless  and today we take that small
BdQB6CFpsFw,453599,459599,step  it's easy to forget how good progress
BdQB6CFpsFw,459599,465199,feels  how incredible it is to know that we're  moving towards something meaningful in
BdQB6CFpsFw,465199,470960,our lives  [Music]  something that we chose that we're  building
BdQB6CFpsFw,470960,476479,we had the courage to break life down so  that piece by piece we could build it
BdQB6CFpsFw,476479,483520,back up  we are our happiest when we are  progressing
BdQB6CFpsFw,483520,490560,we're designed  to map out the unknown unexplored  territory to make it
BdQB6CFpsFw,490560,498319,our own  we're not just flesh and bone but  travelers with godlike capability
BdQB6CFpsFw,498319,505120,of seeing that which is not yet  there  and with an idea and courage
BdQB6CFpsFw,505120,512479,there's nothing we can't do  and that's why when we stop seeing  infinite opportunity when we pretend
BdQB6CFpsFw,512479,520719,that settling is okay the status quo is  enough we know  deep down in our souls that something's
BdQB6CFpsFw,520719,527360,missing we need the next door  to unlock
BdQB6CFpsFw,527600,533519,so today let's find  just one door that we can open
BdQB6CFpsFw,533519,540000,it reminds yourself of the shock wave  that goes through your system when  inspiration
BdQB6CFpsFw,540000,546160,guides an idea and progress turns that  idea into reality because momentum
BdQB6CFpsFw,546160,551440,connects every aspect  of life  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,551440,556640,not hitting the snooze button  can mean seeing the sun rise
BdQB6CFpsFw,556640,564320,which can mean you read three pages in a  book you wouldn't have read which could  mean your day improves which could mean
BdQB6CFpsFw,564320,570640,you make a call that you've been meaning  to make which could mean a dozen wheels  start turning not because you did
BdQB6CFpsFw,570640,576680,everything but because you did one  thing
BdQB6CFpsFw,577200,585040,today can be the day that changes your  life  and you don't even need the miraculous
BdQB6CFpsFw,585040,591519,to make that happen you just need to  push back  against the normalcy of your everyday
BdQB6CFpsFw,591519,598800,create little microcosms of chaos  that you can tame you can understand
BdQB6CFpsFw,598800,604000,make your own and then stack  on top of each other
BdQB6CFpsFw,604000,609120,today you treat that little voice of  uneasiness or nervousness in your
BdQB6CFpsFw,609120,614800,stomach as assurance  that the path before you is the right
BdQB6CFpsFw,614800,621200,one  remember that almost all decisions are  reversible
BdQB6CFpsFw,621200,628560,but that a decision  at least puts you somewhere right or  wrong it moves you along and shows you
BdQB6CFpsFw,628560,635279,more of life the things the people the  places you've never seen before
BdQB6CFpsFw,635279,642399,and the only bad decision  is no decision  some folks never move towards meaning
BdQB6CFpsFw,642399,648399,towards the things that they want in  well their entire lifetime
BdQB6CFpsFw,648399,654720,because they didn't realize it wasn't an  earthquake they needed to shake the old  world at its foundation
BdQB6CFpsFw,654720,662720,they needed to make one decision  one decision that might be wrong
BdQB6CFpsFw,662880,669120,but at the very least would reassure  them that wrong decisions aren't fatal
BdQB6CFpsFw,669360,675839,a decision  allows you to remap  a new reality and take another step and
BdQB6CFpsFw,675839,681040,another and another you can change your  life today
BdQB6CFpsFw,681040,688079,by picking your arena and simply  stepping into it  you don't need to be the best or the
BdQB6CFpsFw,688079,693279,greatest or the most innovative no  that's for another day today if you want
BdQB6CFpsFw,693279,699010,to change your life  open the door  and step
BdQB6CFpsFw,699010,706839,[Music]  in  you'll be amazed at what transpires
BdQB6CFpsFw,722090,725190,[Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,734720,742480,you're not here  just to get by  to check a box
BdQB6CFpsFw,742880,746959,now you're here for something different
BdQB6CFpsFw,748480,756800,maybe it's your desire  to chase down that sunrise while the  rest of the world sleeps
BdQB6CFpsFw,757120,762800,to embrace the difficult  the inconvenient
BdQB6CFpsFw,762800,769920,in exchange for that little bit of glory  you'll soon feel  as you pour your morning coffee
BdQB6CFpsFw,769920,776480,and start your day  or maybe
BdQB6CFpsFw,776480,782320,it's your fascination with the fact that  every time you ask yourself
BdQB6CFpsFw,782320,788800,if there's more  if you have anything left
BdQB6CFpsFw,788800,795920,the answer always seems to be yes  and maybe that's it
BdQB6CFpsFw,795920,803680,that what you're capable of  in a world of finitude and constraint  and limitation seems to be the only
BdQB6CFpsFw,803680,809360,thing with absolutely  no bounds
BdQB6CFpsFw,809760,815279,the human soul undergoes a sort of  transformation if you will
BdQB6CFpsFw,815279,821600,every time we look around at what  currently is  and decide it will soon be the gateway
BdQB6CFpsFw,821600,827040,to something more  and that's life's best kept secret the
BdQB6CFpsFw,827040,834800,word decide  the idea that we choose whether to  accept things as they are or to change
BdQB6CFpsFw,834800,841519,them  that we have within us  the ability to push further
BdQB6CFpsFw,841519,847680,than we've ever pushed  to find what was once only existent
BdQB6CFpsFw,847680,853519,in our imagination  and this will always be true
BdQB6CFpsFw,853519,860079,you get what you seek  what you're willing to endure
BdQB6CFpsFw,860079,866240,and while some see this trade-off as too  much  as a cost far too expensive
BdQB6CFpsFw,866240,872880,others see it as the chance of a  lifetime  the opportunity to give some of you so
BdQB6CFpsFw,872880,878000,that you can grow and improve  all of you see each footstep
BdQB6CFpsFw,878000,885440,is far more than a point on the earth  it's a declaration  a commitment to give more than most
BdQB6CFpsFw,885440,892720,would give so that you can feel what  only a few  will feel
BdQB6CFpsFw,892720,898560,so remember that when things seem  trivial  when it's easier to call it a day or
BdQB6CFpsFw,898560,906880,turn it around  that the simple act of continuing  forward puts you in the minority
BdQB6CFpsFw,906880,912560,it's positioning you to experience life  as it should be lived you're here to
BdQB6CFpsFw,912560,920560,both cherish the now and cash it in let  the value of your courage compound
BdQB6CFpsFw,920560,927120,let your resilience remind you just how  much control you have and how much is
BdQB6CFpsFw,927120,932880,waiting for you  if only you say yes when it hurts
BdQB6CFpsFw,932880,939120,move forward when the path is unclear  believe when the possibility
BdQB6CFpsFw,939120,946399,only exists in your head  you're here  because while it may be easier to watch
BdQB6CFpsFw,946399,952560,life go by from the cheap seats  the risk the sacrifice is worth being
BdQB6CFpsFw,952560,958880,able to look back someday down the road  and know that at least you have the
BdQB6CFpsFw,958880,963880,courage  to play the game
BdQB6CFpsFw,972240,977680,every run tells a tale  all those streets
BdQB6CFpsFw,977680,983839,sidewalks and paths  paint a picture
BdQB6CFpsFw,984160,991040,each footstep  enshrines forever a moment in time
BdQB6CFpsFw,991040,997720,that comes together to comprise  the now
BdQB6CFpsFw,998079,1003600,for my time in cape cod massachusetts  it was asking
BdQB6CFpsFw,1003600,1010160,why not  why not find out if i could be a little  faster than yesterday
BdQB6CFpsFw,1010160,1017360,my first dance with the clock  waking up early running up snake pond
BdQB6CFpsFw,1017360,1025120,road  sun shining in my face inhaling that  crisp morning air
BdQB6CFpsFw,1025120,1031120,it was running along the canal  where the distance was precisely mapped
BdQB6CFpsFw,1031120,1036880,out in paint on the ground below  [Music]  tattooing a path that seemed to go for
BdQB6CFpsFw,1036880,1042720,as long as i wanted to push forward  it taught me
BdQB6CFpsFw,1042720,1049520,that we could do amazing things when we  decided to  [Music]  that we have more in us than we could
BdQB6CFpsFw,1049520,1055360,ever imagine  [Music]  in a sense cape cod was my eyes opening
BdQB6CFpsFw,1055360,1063840,up to the idea that  what life gives us is directly  correlated to what we ask of ourselves
BdQB6CFpsFw,1063840,1072480,so ask for a lot  in boston it was exploration
BdQB6CFpsFw,1072480,1080240,it was pushing myself harder and further  but also stretching my view
BdQB6CFpsFw,1080240,1086000,wider a time for transformation  it was beginning to see the mundane the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1086000,1091039,commonplace for the wolves in sheep's  clothing that they are
BdQB6CFpsFw,1091039,1097120,i began exploring city street like i  simultaneously began exploring life's
BdQB6CFpsFw,1097120,1104480,possibility  i saw how taking new routes  often came with two distinct components
BdQB6CFpsFw,1104480,1111200,one an unsettling nervous feeling in my  stomach into an eventual gratitude for
BdQB6CFpsFw,1111200,1118320,finding the courage to go there  the world will never tell you to go  where you have not yet gone
BdQB6CFpsFw,1118320,1123330,it will never assign you a map and hand  you keys a plane or a bus ticket
BdQB6CFpsFw,1123330,1130799,[Music]  that desire must be cultivated  internally boston was me realizing the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1130799,1136510,unknown wasn't a border keeping me in  it was a hand extended
BdQB6CFpsFw,1136510,1142799,[Music]  in roanoke virginia it was in a sense a  rebirth
BdQB6CFpsFw,1142799,1149760,moving away  post college everything was new was  foreign but everything was exciting
BdQB6CFpsFw,1149760,1155120,i had to learn who i was in new  surroundings with new people
BdQB6CFpsFw,1155120,1160160,my nike running shoes took me through  woods downside streets into the heart of
BdQB6CFpsFw,1160160,1165200,downtown i ran and i ran and i ran
BdQB6CFpsFw,1165200,1171679,because with all that change it was one  of the few constants in my life
BdQB6CFpsFw,1171679,1178880,it brought me to the realization that  with so many moving pieces so many  things shuffling in and out
BdQB6CFpsFw,1178880,1184640,there are parts of me that are  non-negotiable  that in life it's okay and even
BdQB6CFpsFw,1184640,1190400,necessary to change  but one should never lose themselves in
BdQB6CFpsFw,1190400,1196559,that process  they call roanoke the star city of the  south
BdQB6CFpsFw,1196559,1203039,for the giant glowing star that lights  up on the mountain overlooking the city
BdQB6CFpsFw,1203039,1209130,perhaps a reminder  to never lose that north star  in our own lives
BdQB6CFpsFw,1209130,1216000,[Music]  in south florida  it was about connecting the dots
BdQB6CFpsFw,1216000,1221679,had been relentlessly doing  now it was seeing
BdQB6CFpsFw,1221679,1229360,seeing myself as that person  as someone ready for more worthy of a  spot at the table capable of creating
BdQB6CFpsFw,1229360,1235760,monumental change  those soft sand runs reinforce the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1235760,1243360,notion that i get stronger when the  world moves under my feet  those hundreds of thousands of footsteps
BdQB6CFpsFw,1243360,1252880,under the hot sun reiterated that i'm  willing to do what is often deemed  unnecessary or even over the top
BdQB6CFpsFw,1252880,1258400,and lastly living in the luxury of no  winter  reminding me to appreciate the sun the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1258400,1265280,perks the advantages and the victories  we collect along the way  but to never take them for granted to be
BdQB6CFpsFw,1265280,1271919,ready  because life's winters don't always wait  until after fall
BdQB6CFpsFw,1271919,1280000,to show up at your doorstep  every step we take is a lesson
BdQB6CFpsFw,1280000,1286000,every street sidewalk and path is part  of a story
BdQB6CFpsFw,1286000,1291520,and sometimes we don't understand until  we look back at the chapters
BdQB6CFpsFw,1291520,1297440,we don't get it until we have the luxury  of hindsight
BdQB6CFpsFw,1297600,1303200,i didn't know that i look back on snake  pond road as sacred ground
BdQB6CFpsFw,1303200,1309039,as a launch pad to everything that would  come next  no in the moment it was nothing more
BdQB6CFpsFw,1309039,1315919,than a temporary escape  from a world that felt bigger than me
BdQB6CFpsFw,1315919,1323679,i didn't know i'd see the city of boston  as the place that taught me to question  the normalcy of everyday life
BdQB6CFpsFw,1323679,1328799,to show me that one could be moving  awfully fast and still going nowhere at
BdQB6CFpsFw,1328799,1334559,all  no in the moment  it was merely a decision to dip my toe
BdQB6CFpsFw,1334559,1340080,in the water to entertain the curiosity  and sense of adventure that always
BdQB6CFpsFw,1340080,1346400,seemed a few feet ahead  i had no idea roanoke virginia
BdQB6CFpsFw,1346400,1351679,would be where i learned that as emerson  said to be yourself in a world
BdQB6CFpsFw,1351679,1359200,constantly trying to make you something  else is the greatest accomplishment  that there are non-negotiables and
BdQB6CFpsFw,1359200,1364400,shining down above all the noise and  intricacies of everyday life
BdQB6CFpsFw,1364400,1370400,exists the path and the resources to  become who you were meant to be
BdQB6CFpsFw,1370400,1377600,no in the moment i was simply stepping  off my branch and landing somewhere new
BdQB6CFpsFw,1377600,1384880,i didn't know south florida would be my  consistent reminder to level up  to hold tightly that intersection of
BdQB6CFpsFw,1384880,1390960,love and value to find gratitude for  what i have and maintain faith
BdQB6CFpsFw,1390960,1398320,in bringing about what has not yet  materialized know at the time i was  taking my life my business and my
BdQB6CFpsFw,1398320,1403919,running shoes to warmer weather  you may not see it now
BdQB6CFpsFw,1403919,1409440,but your path the one that led you to  today  is the right path
BdQB6CFpsFw,1409440,1415360,you are exactly where you need to be for  the beginning of your next adventure
BdQB6CFpsFw,1415360,1422960,but here's the thing  you  you must keep lacing up your shoes
BdQB6CFpsFw,1422960,1428320,keep getting up in the morning and  chasing those sunrises keep dreaming
BdQB6CFpsFw,1428320,1433759,growing keep your eyes ears and heart  open
BdQB6CFpsFw,1434320,1441679,because the world has so much to give  you  but you have to allow your feet to carry
BdQB6CFpsFw,1441679,1450240,you there  you have to give yourself permission to  take it all in the normalcy of right now
BdQB6CFpsFw,1450240,1457600,down the road will end up being anything  but normal  these steps are the steps that make you
BdQB6CFpsFw,1457600,1465050,who you are so own them  believe in them and most importantly
BdQB6CFpsFw,1465050,1473020,[Music]  keep taking them  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,1480320,1486120,why is this battle you  versus you
BdQB6CFpsFw,1486480,1491679,with all the complexity  all the obstacles out there
BdQB6CFpsFw,1491679,1496399,why are you  your greatest opponent
BdQB6CFpsFw,1497039,1502400,well to put it simply  because all those obstacles
BdQB6CFpsFw,1502400,1508880,and all that complexity  still can't tell you no  they can't say
BdQB6CFpsFw,1508880,1515679,enough is enough  they can't look back at you and say  let's just settle for what we have now
BdQB6CFpsFw,1515679,1520240,no only you  can do that
BdQB6CFpsFw,1521360,1526880,the world may create the landscape  it may construct the terrain
BdQB6CFpsFw,1526880,1532000,and those obstacles  but you are the sole decider
BdQB6CFpsFw,1532000,1538400,on where along the way you stop  you decide how far you want to go and
BdQB6CFpsFw,1538400,1544320,how much you are willing to endure  when it comes to your advancement or
BdQB6CFpsFw,1544320,1549440,limitation  you are in the driver's seat  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,1549440,1555919,i just picked up a copy of will smith's  recent book  and one of the ideas that stood out to
BdQB6CFpsFw,1555919,1561919,me was resilience  and this part in the book  it's actually kind of uncomfortable to
BdQB6CFpsFw,1561919,1570799,get through but incredibly powerful  he's talking about his childhood and the  polarity of his father's personality
BdQB6CFpsFw,1570799,1575840,a man who would do anything to provide  for his family he took pride in that and
BdQB6CFpsFw,1575840,1582159,saw it as his primary responsibility  but  simultaneously was their greatest source
BdQB6CFpsFw,1582159,1588320,of pain  and he mentions his father  hitting his mother from time to time and
BdQB6CFpsFw,1588320,1593760,one particular example struck his mother  in the face so hard that it knocked her
BdQB6CFpsFw,1593760,1599679,on the floor  and as she stood back up she said  something along the lines of you can hit
BdQB6CFpsFw,1599679,1606000,me  but you can't hurt me  and that was the first time will
BdQB6CFpsFw,1606000,1611679,understood as a child the difference  between  uh what the outside world inflicts upon
BdQB6CFpsFw,1611679,1616720,us than how we choose to react to that  occurrence
BdQB6CFpsFw,1616720,1621759,that understanding  is  power
BdQB6CFpsFw,1621919,1628080,that's why you are the author of your  story  in the sense that every single thing
BdQB6CFpsFw,1628080,1633440,dropped at your feet every situation  every occurrence
BdQB6CFpsFw,1633440,1640399,they come with an implicit question  attached a question that you and only  you are responsible for answering the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1640399,1645760,question is  what does this mean
BdQB6CFpsFw,1646000,1651120,and how you respond to that question  determines whether you go left or right
BdQB6CFpsFw,1651120,1658159,at that metaphorical fork in the road  is the occurrence detract from your
BdQB6CFpsFw,1658159,1665520,ambitions or is it a multiplier does it  confirm your doubts and insecurities or  is it your reason to rise to the
BdQB6CFpsFw,1665520,1671679,occasion  an opportunity to stretch to evolve
BdQB6CFpsFw,1671840,1679120,that's a gift that's an invite  not some sort of divine punishment
BdQB6CFpsFw,1679120,1684320,but the challenge is removing the layers  until you arrive at the value
BdQB6CFpsFw,1684320,1690640,and it's hard  but you get there by saying  yes
BdQB6CFpsFw,1690640,1696559,you get there by choosing to see  the value
BdQB6CFpsFw,1696559,1704320,and here's a quick example my favorite  thing about athletics  which was for me a ton of running now i
BdQB6CFpsFw,1704320,1709520,throw  more interval training in there but the  same concepts apply it's a chance to
BdQB6CFpsFw,1709520,1714640,remind myself  that i don't negotiate with my weakness
BdQB6CFpsFw,1714640,1720240,i don't give myself an opportunity  to rationalize with the voice that wants
BdQB6CFpsFw,1720240,1727520,me to quit that question that fork in  the road i answered it  i charted its course before the workout
BdQB6CFpsFw,1727520,1734159,started  knowing this is going to be  uncomfortable at times but it's where i
BdQB6CFpsFw,1734159,1740480,need to go  there will be no more thinking from here  on out
BdQB6CFpsFw,1740480,1746000,and so today's workout for example  switching deadlifts burpees to squats to
BdQB6CFpsFw,1746000,1751679,core  you don't think  you see the next requirement the next
BdQB6CFpsFw,1751679,1757600,task and you simply say yes you don't  need your mind for this
BdQB6CFpsFw,1757600,1764080,in fact you go before your mind even  knows where it's going  because that dotted line has already
BdQB6CFpsFw,1764080,1770480,been  and that was the breakthrough for me  when you separate what you have to do
BdQB6CFpsFw,1770480,1776880,with the hurt associated with doing that  thing you free yourself
BdQB6CFpsFw,1776880,1783600,after all what's there to hold you back  if you can't talk yourself out of doing  things
BdQB6CFpsFw,1783600,1789039,see we tend to think our greatest  adversity is the pain or the confusion
BdQB6CFpsFw,1789039,1795440,or the unknown  but it's like no those are the  byproducts of doing anything of
BdQB6CFpsFw,1795440,1803440,significance  the adversary is the voice that begs you  to slow down because of those things
BdQB6CFpsFw,1803440,1808960,and if you can figure out in your own  life  how to create space between the two how
BdQB6CFpsFw,1808960,1815039,to separate the task and the discomfort  often brought about by the task
BdQB6CFpsFw,1815039,1821520,there's nothing that will ever be able  to slow you down  and look i'm not saying that you walk
BdQB6CFpsFw,1821520,1827360,around without ever utilizing the power  of that brilliant mind you possess
BdQB6CFpsFw,1827360,1833919,one's ability to think is everything but  what i am saying is there is a time to  shut it off
BdQB6CFpsFw,1833919,1840880,there is a time in which to avoid  overthinking we simplify action reaction
BdQB6CFpsFw,1840880,1847039,one more mile okay end of story  one minute of jump squats next roger
BdQB6CFpsFw,1847039,1852880,that period  it's taking the emotion out of the  process refusing to leave the door
BdQB6CFpsFw,1852880,1860240,cracked for the inner dialogue that says  hey maybe you don't do this maybe you  slow down are you sure you can handle
BdQB6CFpsFw,1860240,1868880,what's next  no all of that is tuned out it's  assignment go next go next go you know
BdQB6CFpsFw,1868880,1873919,this is the right thing you did your  thinking before grabbing the sword
BdQB6CFpsFw,1873919,1880240,shield and stepping into the  arena now guess what it's instinct it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,1880240,1886080,doing what has to be done  and what has to be done  hurts
BdQB6CFpsFw,1886080,1893039,and look you didn't have to accept that  you didn't have to step in
BdQB6CFpsFw,1893039,1899279,you could have stayed home  but somewhere  along the way you looked in the mirror
BdQB6CFpsFw,1899279,1905200,and said  the difficult path  is the one with the value
BdQB6CFpsFw,1905200,1910399,and now here you are  face to face with hungry lions
BdQB6CFpsFw,1910399,1915679,clashing swords with your adversaries  there's no turning back now
BdQB6CFpsFw,1915679,1921679,now is when you parse out pain from the  objective the pain is now part
BdQB6CFpsFw,1921679,1927519,of the audience  it's not with you or in you it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,1927519,1933519,watching from above  as you do what you came here to do
BdQB6CFpsFw,1933519,1939600,so yes those swords clash but the eyes  remain focused on what's ahead
BdQB6CFpsFw,1939600,1944960,and yes those lions roar but that's  background noise
BdQB6CFpsFw,1944960,1951279,when you simplify your world into  objective and action objective action
BdQB6CFpsFw,1951279,1957039,objective action there is time for  nothing but forward progress
BdQB6CFpsFw,1957039,1962720,and sometimes that is all that is  required of us in the face of adversity
BdQB6CFpsFw,1962720,1967919,in the face of pain self-doubt in the  face of discomfort
BdQB6CFpsFw,1967919,1975279,can you break your world down into  nothing but one single step forward
BdQB6CFpsFw,1975279,1981679,one more set one more rep  one more session one more attempt
BdQB6CFpsFw,1981679,1989440,just one more  no rocket science  no negotiation there's nothing to figure
BdQB6CFpsFw,1989440,1997200,out here  it's walking the path before you it's  the discipline to carry on it's one more
BdQB6CFpsFw,1997200,2004399,swing of the axe audience or no audience  lions or no lions you are bound
BdQB6CFpsFw,2004399,2011039,to the universe at your feet  and that simplified concentration is why
BdQB6CFpsFw,2011039,2016099,you will succeed  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,2023279,2029200,for a second imagine that feeling in  your stomach  the nerves
BdQB6CFpsFw,2029200,2035120,the discomfort maybe even the doubt as  you walk up  to do that one thing that
BdQB6CFpsFw,2035120,2042000,scares you  this stretches you just a little bit  further than you're ready for
BdQB6CFpsFw,2042000,2047360,and as you move towards that sort of  dark unknown the mysterious discomfort
BdQB6CFpsFw,2047360,2052720,what's on your mind  are you starting to rationalize
BdQB6CFpsFw,2052720,2058960,maybe you're asking yourself hey why did  i do this to begin with  seemed like a good idea at one point and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2058960,2065919,seemed bold and adventurous  but now it seems like the wheels have  hit the road and the narrative
BdQB6CFpsFw,2065919,2071839,is shifting in real time  so try and recreate that feeling for a
BdQB6CFpsFw,2071839,2079280,second  looking fear in the eyes  capture what it means physically
BdQB6CFpsFw,2079280,2085919,mentally  for me it was public speaking right half  a decade ago standing backstage palms
BdQB6CFpsFw,2085919,2092800,sweating a little voice in my head  saying hey ed you know cubicle doesn't  seem so bad right now that's a genius
BdQB6CFpsFw,2092800,2098960,maybe you know for you in this scenario  it's that big test that feels like the  weight of the world is on your shoulders
BdQB6CFpsFw,2098960,2105520,everything's on the line  maybe it's something like starting a  conversation with a complete stranger
BdQB6CFpsFw,2105520,2112400,interview for a job you want  starting line of a race having the  courage to speak your mind online
BdQB6CFpsFw,2112400,2118400,maybe it's doing something your family  doesn't quite get your friends won't  understand cutting ties with what's
BdQB6CFpsFw,2118400,2123440,comfortable a decision to be what you've  always wanted to be there's a million
BdQB6CFpsFw,2123440,2130320,possibilities  right there's a lot of fear that we  dance with on a day-to-day basis
BdQB6CFpsFw,2130320,2137040,but in that moment  as your feet start moving in the very  direction that will bring your ideas
BdQB6CFpsFw,2137040,2142720,closer to your reality  and you're hit with that same feeling  that wall that tells us something isn't
BdQB6CFpsFw,2142720,2148800,quite right  that's what i want to discuss  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,2148800,2155359,because it's hard to be met with this  feeling  and still move confidently in the same
BdQB6CFpsFw,2155359,2160800,direction right there's cognitive  dissonance there  how can something feel wrong and be
BdQB6CFpsFw,2160800,2167920,right  should there be disconnect
BdQB6CFpsFw,2168800,2174000,you know it's funny i uh i really enjoy  reading quotes and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2174000,2180160,particularly lewis carroll has resonated  with me over the years  you know things he said in his works
BdQB6CFpsFw,2180160,2185200,they're witty they're funny but they're  powerful  and one in particular stood out to me
BdQB6CFpsFw,2185200,2190510,it's why sometimes i believed as many as  six impossible things before breakfast
BdQB6CFpsFw,2190510,2196000,[Music]  i just loved the concept the idea of  immersing yourself
BdQB6CFpsFw,2196000,2201040,you know in the impossible in in the the  difficult the thing that's not right in
BdQB6CFpsFw,2201040,2206160,front of you and sort of creating it as  you go  so i got through the looking glass and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2206160,2212000,adventures of alice in wonderland and  it was an interesting read i'm not sure  i'd recommend it for everyone but there
BdQB6CFpsFw,2212000,2218640,was certainly one thing that  popped out at me that i found incredibly  valuable
BdQB6CFpsFw,2218640,2224640,and it was in alice's journey  holistically right so just she goes into  this rabbit hole
BdQB6CFpsFw,2224640,2230160,and  the world is basically upside down  nothing is as it was before she jumped
BdQB6CFpsFw,2230160,2235599,nothing really makes sense  and what you see is her progression as a  character
BdQB6CFpsFw,2235599,2241280,as she starts continually embracing the  thing that feels abnormal upside down
BdQB6CFpsFw,2241280,2249680,and weird  but with each decision to move forward  she completely redefines this insane
BdQB6CFpsFw,2249680,2254880,world  that wasn't particularly warm and  receptive to alice to begin with
BdQB6CFpsFw,2254880,2261599,as she stands up to a queen running  around ordering executions  she navigates a world with new rules and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2261599,2268240,guidelines she transforms the boundaries  that used to define reality and what i  think is valuable
BdQB6CFpsFw,2268240,2274640,is that there really wasn't this boom  transformative moment where everything  changes she just keeps subtly saying yes
BdQB6CFpsFw,2274640,2281839,she keeps moving forward without knowing  for sure how things will work out or  unfold  as if she's supposed to
BdQB6CFpsFw,2281839,2286960,and she becomes so accustomed to  suppressing that feeling of fear and  uneasiness that it almost becomes
BdQB6CFpsFw,2286960,2293119,comical  she goes with it and becomes the author  of a new story she becomes untouchable
BdQB6CFpsFw,2293119,2299440,in this world  and my point here  and for those of you not a fan of alice
BdQB6CFpsFw,2299440,2306000,in wonderland i appreciate you hanging  on but where these dots connect is that  uh it's actually a pretty simple idea
BdQB6CFpsFw,2306000,2312880,life unfolds in a way that is  unimaginable  when we shift our thinking from oh no
BdQB6CFpsFw,2312880,2319760,here comes that feeling in my stomach  again my heart's pounding my palms are  sweating so i've wandered too far
BdQB6CFpsFw,2319760,2325200,when you change that to here comes that  feeling in my stomach heart pounding  palms sweating so
BdQB6CFpsFw,2325200,2330740,here comes the beginning of something  incredible  life shifts
BdQB6CFpsFw,2330740,2336560,[Music]  see it's not running from that temporary  feeling of fear and discomfort but
BdQB6CFpsFw,2336560,2343440,harnessing it it's a weapon it's a tool  right it fuels  the rocket ship headed to the moon it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,2343440,2349599,the water  that that seed of opportunity is  dependent upon
BdQB6CFpsFw,2349599,2355599,and sure it feels new and unsettling and  yes uncomfortable but so is as we learn
BdQB6CFpsFw,2355599,2362400,everything good  and sure you could turn back you could  avoid that manufactured conflict
BdQB6CFpsFw,2362400,2367599,confrontation altogether but man you  have to be okay never knowing what those
BdQB6CFpsFw,2367599,2373280,peaks could have been  you have to be content imagining a life
BdQB6CFpsFw,2373280,2378880,of adventure  and not living it and to me that's a  much steeper price
BdQB6CFpsFw,2378880,2384640,right because that feeling of fear in  your stomach it's temporary it goes away  but the
BdQB6CFpsFw,2384640,2391680,the feeling of knowing  you walked away when life held out its  hand and offered you more that doesn't
BdQB6CFpsFw,2391680,2399920,go away  and see i look at it like this two  things change every time you say yes
BdQB6CFpsFw,2399920,2407520,every time you acknowledge the organized  chaos and move forward anyway  you move both your internal and external
BdQB6CFpsFw,2407520,2415280,worlds one step forward  internal because life is your identity
BdQB6CFpsFw,2415280,2421920,and as has been said before humans  always follow through on who they  believe they are
BdQB6CFpsFw,2421920,2428640,i've heard actors saying the most  important decision they make is the  shoes they put on  because it lays the groundwork for how
BdQB6CFpsFw,2428640,2435119,you feel  you just feel differently about yourself  in clown shoes than you would in  basketball shoes than you would in dress
BdQB6CFpsFw,2435119,2440960,shoes you feel different about yourself  in a suit than you would in sweatpants  and this doesn't mean go reassess your
BdQB6CFpsFw,2440960,2446960,wardrobe it highlights how malleable  identity is  yeah we follow through on who we believe
BdQB6CFpsFw,2446960,2453680,we are  but the powerful thing is who we believe  we are is created every single day
BdQB6CFpsFw,2453680,2460319,every time we use fear to propel us  forward right your subconscious goes  okay that's who i am
BdQB6CFpsFw,2460319,2467440,someone who does the uncomfortable thing  someone who is okay with fear that's  me right and that's the internal
BdQB6CFpsFw,2467440,2473440,foundation that means everything that's  how identity is constructed  and if you stack that up with action
BdQB6CFpsFw,2473440,2478880,every single day you won't even be able  to recognize yourself  that's the internal transformation then
BdQB6CFpsFw,2478880,2484240,there's the external transformation  every time you push through fear you  level up
BdQB6CFpsFw,2484240,2490720,not significantly  right you aren't immediately transformed  in fact sometimes you don't even notice
BdQB6CFpsFw,2490720,2496960,but the truth is after you say yes after  you take that step you're fractionally  further than a few minutes earlier
BdQB6CFpsFw,2496960,2504720,your relative ceiling is now the floor  and it's time to take another step  this is how you create distance over
BdQB6CFpsFw,2504720,2512720,time  so when you hear the word fear let's  rewire that reaction let's change how we
BdQB6CFpsFw,2512720,2519280,think about it  because it's not a monster in the closet  it's not some demon staring you in the
BdQB6CFpsFw,2519280,2525920,face  no it's a ticket to something more  something to be embraced and coveted
BdQB6CFpsFw,2525920,2531280,it's the next little step in your  journey  and why when most of the world bows down
BdQB6CFpsFw,2531280,2538160,to that feeling of discomfort or  instability and stays the same  you will have moved forward
BdQB6CFpsFw,2538160,2543920,not in a single leap but a step a step  that over time will become the reason
BdQB6CFpsFw,2543920,2552599,that at some point  when you look over your shoulder you'll  find a life a world a reality that is
BdQB6CFpsFw,2552599,2559680,unrecognizable  in the context of where you began  it's why fear is not to be avoided or
BdQB6CFpsFw,2559680,2565119,even tolerated but sought out as the  single variable that puts a pulse in
BdQB6CFpsFw,2565119,2571520,your aspirations gives hope to your  dreams the ideal life
BdQB6CFpsFw,2571520,2579200,is not predicated on the avoidance of  fear  but the ability to harness and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2579200,2584838,capitalize  on its power

BdQB6CFpsFw,2610240,2617520,there's a saying that what you water is  ultimately what grows  that where you place your attention
BdQB6CFpsFw,2617520,2622800,ends up guiding your feelings your  perception your actions and your life
BdQB6CFpsFw,2622800,2629040,right focus becomes identity  and change comes from bringing awareness
BdQB6CFpsFw,2629040,2634800,to what we're focusing on  i remember when this light bulb went off  for me
BdQB6CFpsFw,2634800,2640560,like so many epiphanies you know what  happened during a difficult kind of a  trying time it wasn't where i wanted to
BdQB6CFpsFw,2640560,2646640,be and i remember you know sitting down  and asking myself you know dude are you  on your own team here are you helping
BdQB6CFpsFw,2646640,2652160,yourself  using the metaphor the question was am i
BdQB6CFpsFw,2652160,2659920,watering the weeds in my life or the  flowers  and by the weeds i mean am i allocating
BdQB6CFpsFw,2659920,2664960,energy to thoughts that are detrimental  to what i want
BdQB6CFpsFw,2664960,2670640,am i keeping myself in places i don't  want to be and in relationships that are  counterproductive am i thinking about
BdQB6CFpsFw,2670640,2676039,what can go wrong instead of all that  can go right
BdQB6CFpsFw,2676960,2682800,or am i watering the flowers the  positive highlighting the possibility  the things i'm appreciative for the
BdQB6CFpsFw,2682800,2689520,seeds the potential that can grow a mile  high  see i've always known the value in
BdQB6CFpsFw,2689520,2694560,choosing to see the possibility  but the million dollar question is how
BdQB6CFpsFw,2694560,2699599,do you remain aware  because that's the thing about weeds
BdQB6CFpsFw,2699599,2705839,they're sneaky they'll take control of  your life without letting you know  they're doing it
BdQB6CFpsFw,2706240,2711520,so i'm thinking this through and it  dawns on me this is not complex
BdQB6CFpsFw,2711520,2718880,this is simple  it's one identifying where you want to  be and two analyzing your actions
BdQB6CFpsFw,2718880,2725760,based on those priorities right that's  it and so for every pillar of my life  health relationships career finances
BdQB6CFpsFw,2725760,2732480,i made two dots  one for where i am  and one for where i want to be
BdQB6CFpsFw,2732480,2738079,everything in the middle is life the ops  the downs the joys the sorrow
BdQB6CFpsFw,2738079,2745760,everything in between is the path the  line  [Music]  and it's simple you start on point a
BdQB6CFpsFw,2745760,2750880,knowing that you can always get to point  b
BdQB6CFpsFw,2750880,2757520,that what you want exists it's there  it's available  and your attention all of your energy
BdQB6CFpsFw,2757520,2763760,should be allocated to the thoughts that  reinforce that truth that's your path  that's what you believe that's what's
BdQB6CFpsFw,2763760,2769280,important and it's going to happen  anything beyond or outside that line
BdQB6CFpsFw,2769280,2775680,anything that tells you you're not good  enough anything that accepts not  achieving that priority suggests it
BdQB6CFpsFw,2775680,2781920,won't work out that is where the weeds  live that is wasted space why exhaust
BdQB6CFpsFw,2781920,2787760,that energy  [Music]  right to think you know i'm not good
BdQB6CFpsFw,2787760,2794880,enough to get this promotion how does  that help you get to your point b  it doesn't eliminate that thought right
BdQB6CFpsFw,2794880,2800240,point b always exists  just that notion pushes a lot of things
BdQB6CFpsFw,2800240,2805359,to the side you have to be good enough  you just need improvement maybe it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,2805359,2812480,enhanced skills maybe it's more effort  maybe it's changed approach but tackling  these things will water the flowers it
BdQB6CFpsFw,2812480,2817839,moves you along the path and progress is  happiness
BdQB6CFpsFw,2817839,2823920,right for me  health is a big thing i run all the time  but i'd like to be more fit i'd like to  eat healthier there's room for
BdQB6CFpsFw,2823920,2830480,improvement and i know it's possible  because that is my point b i know that
BdQB6CFpsFw,2830480,2836720,saying i don't have time or i don't have  the right body type or genes or trying  to convince myself that fast food just
BdQB6CFpsFw,2836720,2843760,this once will be okay no all of that  stuff is watering weeds it exists  outside my path
BdQB6CFpsFw,2843760,2849680,my time should be spent realizing how  incredible the human body is taking care  of it pushing it being proud of it
BdQB6CFpsFw,2849680,2855599,taking accountability for it  that's me i only get one of these things  even if it's just a little at a time
BdQB6CFpsFw,2855599,2862720,that's the beauty simply existing on a  path and revolving around your ideals  your vision your priorities brings about
BdQB6CFpsFw,2862720,2868240,joy  [Music]  negativity it truly is a learned thing
BdQB6CFpsFw,2868240,2874079,it's manufactured  all there are in life are circumstances  circumstances that are neither positive
BdQB6CFpsFw,2874079,2882079,nor negative just pieces and you decide  what to do with them  do you focus on the negative you can
BdQB6CFpsFw,2882079,2887520,but that won't put you in a position to  change your circumstances or bring about  happiness
BdQB6CFpsFw,2887520,2893680,when you decide to see the opportunity  you free yourself from the shackles of  fate because destiny never put you in
BdQB6CFpsFw,2893680,2899760,the situation you did but guess what you  can take yourself out of it  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,2899760,2905680,a field of sunflowers grew one root one  stem one petal at a time the same fuel
BdQB6CFpsFw,2905680,2912839,that was at one point nothing more than  dirt and weeds it was always possible  and so is your ideal
BdQB6CFpsFw,2912839,2918370,life you just need to water the things  that matter

BdQB6CFpsFw,2947920,2954240,that likelihood of success  and i can tell you with confidence
BdQB6CFpsFw,2954240,2960400,you've never seen your body's  limitations  what you've seen are the limitations of
BdQB6CFpsFw,2960400,2966160,your mind  when you're tired or uncomfortable
BdQB6CFpsFw,2966160,2972640,weak or unsure these things start as  fear  being planted in your brain and
BdQB6CFpsFw,2972640,2978000,attempting to grow roots looking to  acquire the real estate that exists
BdQB6CFpsFw,2978000,2985920,between your ears  it's a powerful  [Music]  source it can manipulate you your
BdQB6CFpsFw,2985920,2992000,reality anyone and everyone around you  but it only exists with your permission
BdQB6CFpsFw,2992000,2998880,and we're not always cognizant that  we've opened the gate and let it in  that's the crazy part
BdQB6CFpsFw,2998880,3006319,oh but we do  subconsciously or not it's the reason  you haven't gone as far as you can go
BdQB6CFpsFw,3006319,3013280,pushed as hard as you possibly can  because at some point fear stood between  you and what you want
BdQB6CFpsFw,3013280,3019280,at some point you started asking  yourself if you've gone too far  [Music]
BdQB6CFpsFw,3019280,3024800,look it doesn't matter if it's athletics  or business or art or anything when
BdQB6CFpsFw,3024800,3030640,things become uncomfortable or hurt  fear always shows its face it's not
BdQB6CFpsFw,3030640,3037200,because you know you're dragging your  leg on the floor or your knee gave out  it's not because you can't go on it's
BdQB6CFpsFw,3037200,3042640,because those thoughts trickle into your  mind about not being able to finish
BdQB6CFpsFw,3042640,3049599,what if i can't handle this i don't  usually go this far am i pushing harder  than i normally do is this right is it
BdQB6CFpsFw,3049599,3055280,dangerous is it over the top  these thoughts are the seed

BdQB6CFpsFw,3102880,3109599,concerns about the world conspiring  against you but the body does not  control the mind the mind dictates what
BdQB6CFpsFw,3109599,3116720,the body does  see the thing about life  is that we all have narratives we all

BdQB6CFpsFw,3529400,3535040,[Music]  i reached into the fire i took

BdQB6CFpsFw,3571680,3575279,waking  moment
BdQB6CFpsFw,3576799,3581839,once fear was removed hesitation  followed quickly behind action is what
BdQB6CFpsFw,3581839,3588000,remained and its influence  was overwhelming
BdQB6CFpsFw,3588000,3594319,i realized that the only way to weaken  my current state  was to bow down to this mountain
BdQB6CFpsFw,3594319,3599520,towering over me to retreat  because with the simple act of moving
BdQB6CFpsFw,3599520,3605520,forward i'd become empowered  with every step i was redefined i was
BdQB6CFpsFw,3605520,3611280,something more life became not a window  to peer out of
BdQB6CFpsFw,3611280,3616720,but an incredible sprint with no end or  finish
BdQB6CFpsFw,3616720,3621920,i became obsessed with trying to capture  and soak up everything i could i wanted
BdQB6CFpsFw,3621920,3627760,to trip to stumble to fall my way to  more i wanted to fail my way to
BdQB6CFpsFw,3627760,3635040,greatness  my only fear was slowing down it was  missing out and as my armor grew
BdQB6CFpsFw,3635040,3641520,stronger my legs moved faster there  simply wasn't enough time to breathe it
BdQB6CFpsFw,3641520,3648640,all in  see it's incredibly simple  when i faced my demons it's not just
BdQB6CFpsFw,3648640,3654319,that i became free of them they lifted  me up i'd been running away from the
BdQB6CFpsFw,3654319,3660160,very pieces that i needed most  this armor is a million mistakes it's a
BdQB6CFpsFw,3660160,3666799,million tragedies it's let downs and  lessons but because of them my world is
BdQB6CFpsFw,3666799,3672640,limitless  there is nothing that i can't get  through i've been there i'm battle
BdQB6CFpsFw,3672640,3678319,tested and anything that stands before  me will become the armor on my back as i
