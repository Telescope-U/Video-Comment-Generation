JC-qGzTIpEo,371,2954,[upbeat music]
JC-qGzTIpEo,19950,22360,"- Hey, it's Paloma and welcome back to Good Morning Vogue"
JC-qGzTIpEo,22360,24470,and the end of New York Fashion Week.
JC-qGzTIpEo,24470,26689,"For our final segment, we'll be talking to an assortment"
JC-qGzTIpEo,26690,28320,of thought leaders on their perspective
JC-qGzTIpEo,28320,31510,around the intersection of fashion and activism.
JC-qGzTIpEo,31510,33440,"But first, let's recap."
JC-qGzTIpEo,33440,35320,"Earlier in the week, we spoke to a bunch"
JC-qGzTIpEo,35320,37840,"of amazing stylists, designers and editors"
JC-qGzTIpEo,37840,40190,around where they think the industry should go.
JC-qGzTIpEo,44460,47140,"- I think, for years, all of us who work"
JC-qGzTIpEo,47140,49809,in the fashion industry have been talking
JC-qGzTIpEo,49810,54110,"about how bloated and old fashioned, frankly,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,54110,56640,the whole system of attending the shows
JC-qGzTIpEo,56640,58620,and the amount of people that would travel
JC-qGzTIpEo,58620,63140,"from city to city, spending a huge amount of money."
JC-qGzTIpEo,63140,66270,"It was this extraordinary spectacle,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,66270,69729,"which at the same time, generated a huge amount"
JC-qGzTIpEo,69730,73300,of impressions and an enormous amount of interest
JC-qGzTIpEo,73300,75569,and following in fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,75569,80569,"But as a way to run a business, it simply wasn't working."
JC-qGzTIpEo,81229,83280,- I think the main thing about our industry
JC-qGzTIpEo,83280,86740,that needs to change is the speed of it.
JC-qGzTIpEo,86740,89100,We create too many collections a year.
JC-qGzTIpEo,89100,91540,We create too many things.
JC-qGzTIpEo,91540,95202,"I think ultimately, our customer has started to view"
JC-qGzTIpEo,95202,98700,what we create as almost disposable.
JC-qGzTIpEo,98700,102399,- It's like a mixture between autopilot
JC-qGzTIpEo,102400,103900,and an assembly line.
JC-qGzTIpEo,103900,105960,- So much of what the fashion industry
JC-qGzTIpEo,105960,108570,has been missing the plot on
JC-qGzTIpEo,108570,112803,is reality and actual inclusion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,114770,119770,"- At the start of 2020, it was like the crack in the glass."
JC-qGzTIpEo,119810,122899,"With the pause, we felt where the industry"
JC-qGzTIpEo,122900,126200,"was just sort of under, overrunning itself."
JC-qGzTIpEo,126200,130149,"By the middle of the year, when George Floyd was murdered,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,130149,133140,it allowed us to look at ourselves in the mirror
JC-qGzTIpEo,133140,137770,to sort of recognize the racial inequalities
JC-qGzTIpEo,137770,141920,"that still exist in America and the world abroad,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,141920,145362,"and us as a fashion industry, what do we do?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,146390,150470,"We project images, we almost give perceived value"
JC-qGzTIpEo,150470,152640,"and then when we look at ourselves,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,152640,156640,we look at how imbalanced maybe that representation is.
JC-qGzTIpEo,156640,160260,- There is a real reckoning taking place in America
JC-qGzTIpEo,160260,163480,"right now, in an attempt to confront years"
JC-qGzTIpEo,163480,165653,"of systemic racism in this country,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,167070,169390,"and of course this impacts the fashion world,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,169390,173110,as well as obviously the world at large.
JC-qGzTIpEo,173110,176580,"- We, as a fashion industry, have never really tackled"
JC-qGzTIpEo,176580,178400,the subject of race.
JC-qGzTIpEo,178400,180030,"Now it's a conversation that's happening,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,180030,183410,which I love that it's happening more and more.
JC-qGzTIpEo,183410,185900,I think now we're even looking beneath the surface
JC-qGzTIpEo,185900,188379,and we're starting to look at systemic racism
JC-qGzTIpEo,188380,190420,"and all of the challenges that cause,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,190420,192530,and we're not just looking at what it is
JC-qGzTIpEo,192530,194459,but we're looking at why it is.
JC-qGzTIpEo,194460,197070,- You have to face the world today.
JC-qGzTIpEo,197070,200443,"If you are in fashion and you just do clothes,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,200443,204790,I think that you do half of your job.
JC-qGzTIpEo,204790,208079,Our job is about witnessing our time
JC-qGzTIpEo,208080,210910,and commitment to delivering an idea of beauty.
JC-qGzTIpEo,210910,215173,"We need to be more inclusive, it's impossible not to do it."
JC-qGzTIpEo,215173,217125,"- I think now more than ever,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,217125,220420,people's consumption is going to want to match
JC-qGzTIpEo,220420,221653,their value system.
JC-qGzTIpEo,222530,224910,"And I think, for me personally"
JC-qGzTIpEo,224910,227690,"and I know all of my customers and my community,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,227690,231520,"they're very into voting with their money, you know?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,231520,233970,And when someone spends money on your brand
JC-qGzTIpEo,233970,235290,"or when someone spends money at all,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,235290,237773,that's a power transaction.
JC-qGzTIpEo,237773,239830,"Even when you like something on Instagram,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,239830,241560,that's a power transaction.
JC-qGzTIpEo,241560,243819,So you need to spend your time and your resources
JC-qGzTIpEo,243820,246190,on the things that you wanna see do well and succeed.
JC-qGzTIpEo,246190,250870,- What's been incredible and positive about this experience
JC-qGzTIpEo,250870,252980,that everybody has been going through
JC-qGzTIpEo,252980,255290,is that it has been a time for reflection
JC-qGzTIpEo,255290,258509,"and fur us all to think about what went wrong,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,258510,262780,why it went wrong and what we can do differently.
JC-qGzTIpEo,262780,265660,"So after the pandemic first hit,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,265660,267570,I think everybody's reaction
JC-qGzTIpEo,267570,270150,within the American fashion community
JC-qGzTIpEo,270150,272580,"and certainly at Vogue and the CFDA,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,272580,274250,"was, ""What can we do to help?"""
JC-qGzTIpEo,274250,277010,We realized that we could take the Fashion Fund
JC-qGzTIpEo,277010,281220,"and repurpose it as an initiative called A Common Thread,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,281220,285410,"and raise money to help those that were most in need,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,285410,288340,whether it was designers or small businesses
JC-qGzTIpEo,288340,293230,"like small boutiques or even factories, stylists,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,293230,295340,anyone that was part of our community
JC-qGzTIpEo,295340,298750,that was really struggling during the past few months.
JC-qGzTIpEo,298750,302460,- One of the most inspiring things I've seen
JC-qGzTIpEo,302460,306792,"is how designers,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,306792,309330,"particularly the designers that I work with,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,309330,312030,"which are mostly black and Latina designers,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,312030,316413,how they have taken this moment and leveraged it.
JC-qGzTIpEo,316413,318530,"I mean, I'm talking about from the pandemic."
JC-qGzTIpEo,318530,321610,"Even in the most dire situation,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,321610,326610,that they figured out a way to be optimistic
JC-qGzTIpEo,326870,331870,"and to create, in a situation that felt pretty hopeless."
JC-qGzTIpEo,331930,335039,- I think that the most inspiring thing that I've seen
JC-qGzTIpEo,335040,338770,"during this moment, I think, has been less of an emphasis"
JC-qGzTIpEo,338770,342740,on selling product or making product or just things
JC-qGzTIpEo,342740,346509,"and more of an emphasis on community, on equality,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,346510,348870,"on feeling, on emotion, which is the reason"
JC-qGzTIpEo,348870,351513,that we all probably got into fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,352900,355380,- Tom Ford calls this period a hibernation.
JC-qGzTIpEo,355380,360189,I think that anybody who can say fashion is going to be this
JC-qGzTIpEo,360189,364229,"in six months or even in a year, they're lying."
JC-qGzTIpEo,364230,365210,Nobody knows.
JC-qGzTIpEo,365210,367819,I think we're in a moment where people are gonna try
JC-qGzTIpEo,367820,369090,a lot of different things.
JC-qGzTIpEo,369090,371260,- I'm essentially just trying to lead by example
JC-qGzTIpEo,371260,374862,'cause I know that this industry is a great one.
JC-qGzTIpEo,374862,377290,I know that there's a changing of the guard.
JC-qGzTIpEo,377290,379100,We've been passed the baton.
JC-qGzTIpEo,379100,382410,It's up to us to sort of make the change
JC-qGzTIpEo,382410,383830,that we wanna see.
JC-qGzTIpEo,383830,387180,- I just wanna see a complete rethinking
JC-qGzTIpEo,387180,389280,"of what it means to be diverse,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,389280,391650,which in my mind is just accepting
JC-qGzTIpEo,391650,393403,the multitudes of existence.
JC-qGzTIpEo,393403,396090,Every kind of person should see themselves in fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,396090,398620,- None of us really know what fashion is gonna be
JC-qGzTIpEo,398620,399949,"in the next two to three years,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,399950,401060,"how the industry is gonna look,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,401060,403320,but I do believe that it has been decentralized.
JC-qGzTIpEo,403320,406870,I don't think it will ever go back to business as usual.
JC-qGzTIpEo,406870,410643,"- For 2021, I think it's gonna take a little while"
JC-qGzTIpEo,410643,414170,"for us to get there, and I think as we start"
JC-qGzTIpEo,414170,417280,"to get out of the weeds, even when I talk about it,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,417280,419980,I feel a cellular shift in myself.
JC-qGzTIpEo,419980,422300,We will have all emerged a little bit differently
JC-qGzTIpEo,422300,424222,and I think I'm excited to see the new colors
JC-qGzTIpEo,424222,426719,"that people will have, the new stripes."
JC-qGzTIpEo,426720,429460,- I get really mad when I read the articles
JC-qGzTIpEo,429460,432270,about fashion being over and nobody needs it.
JC-qGzTIpEo,432270,433389,We all need fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,433390,435340,We all need clothes to put on our backs
JC-qGzTIpEo,435340,438510,"and to express ourselves, and I think, out of this"
JC-qGzTIpEo,438510,441860,is gonna come an even deeper desire for fashion
JC-qGzTIpEo,441860,443680,"and for the best of fashion,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,443680,447421,and it's the mundane and the knock offs and the cheap stuff
JC-qGzTIpEo,447421,449460,"that is gonna fall by the wayside,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,449460,451120,and it's gonna be a celebration
JC-qGzTIpEo,451120,454110,of what is really the best of what we do.
JC-qGzTIpEo,454110,458750,"- After the pandemic of 1918 and after World War I,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,459600,460660,what did we have?
JC-qGzTIpEo,460660,462713,We had the Roaring 20s.
JC-qGzTIpEo,466720,467900,"- For our second story this week,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,467900,469889,we went to the Brooklyn home of Pyer Moss founder
JC-qGzTIpEo,469890,472120,"Kerby Jean-Raymond, where we spoke of independence"
JC-qGzTIpEo,472120,473834,and creativity in fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,473834,476334,[dance music]
JC-qGzTIpEo,480720,483830,"- This is my last interview, I would say, for a while,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,483830,487235,just because I don't feel like I have anything else to offer
JC-qGzTIpEo,487235,491449,in terms of recapping my story at this point.
JC-qGzTIpEo,491450,496050,I just feel like publications and people who interview me
JC-qGzTIpEo,496050,499449,tend to kind of look for a specific narrative
JC-qGzTIpEo,499450,500320,"in the things that I say,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,500320,501970,instead of trying to really capture
JC-qGzTIpEo,501970,504180,who I'm presenting myself to be.
JC-qGzTIpEo,504180,507000,They have a tendency to make me sound mean
JC-qGzTIpEo,507000,510290,"or take pictures of me that make me look angry,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,510290,512490,so I'm just gonna take the Beyonce approach.
JC-qGzTIpEo,513430,515610,Your Friends in New York is an ecosystem.
JC-qGzTIpEo,515610,519440,"It aims to solve a lot of problems for designers,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,519440,523659,"creatives, people who work in and around our industry"
JC-qGzTIpEo,523659,526360,and takes a lot of inclusive approaches
JC-qGzTIpEo,526360,529453,to reestablish the future of fashion.
JC-qGzTIpEo,530500,535200,"This is not about to be a version of CFDA Incubator,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,535200,538320,and this is not about to be a version of an accelerator
JC-qGzTIpEo,538320,540900,"from Silicon Valley or anything like that,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,540900,542210,this is not that at all.
JC-qGzTIpEo,542210,545370,This is more Def Jam in the mid 90s
JC-qGzTIpEo,545370,547560,or Rockefeller in the early 2000s
JC-qGzTIpEo,547560,551100,than it is a charitable approach to anything.
JC-qGzTIpEo,551100,552740,"This is definitely a new way of doing things,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,552740,553573,a new way of thinking.
JC-qGzTIpEo,553573,555220,It's an audacious way of thinking.
JC-qGzTIpEo,555220,557784,I hope that this becomes the new way of doing things
JC-qGzTIpEo,557784,560390,where designers do get a fair shake
JC-qGzTIpEo,560390,562180,and that we're just not creating free content
JC-qGzTIpEo,562180,565360,for publications and media platforms with nothing in return.
JC-qGzTIpEo,565360,566680,I wanna get it right
JC-qGzTIpEo,566680,570570,and I want to create a sustainable system
JC-qGzTIpEo,570570,574863,"where new brands, helmed by people that look like us,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,574863,578300,can actually get a shot at being sustainable.
JC-qGzTIpEo,578300,579714,This is an atom bomb.
JC-qGzTIpEo,579715,583700,"This is no distractions, plus a pandemic that's making us"
JC-qGzTIpEo,583700,585380,really value life in a different way.
JC-qGzTIpEo,585380,588320,We've had a lot more time with our own thoughts
JC-qGzTIpEo,588320,590140,but also with people that we love.
JC-qGzTIpEo,590140,592890,We didn't see George Floyd get murdered
JC-qGzTIpEo,592890,596580,and then be able to go back to work the next day.
JC-qGzTIpEo,596580,597700,We had to sit with that thought.
JC-qGzTIpEo,597700,599790,We had to sit with that aggression.
JC-qGzTIpEo,599790,603209,And then you hear Elijah McClain and you hear Tony McDade
JC-qGzTIpEo,603210,605580,"and you hear Breona Taylor, and then you go back"
JC-qGzTIpEo,605580,608860,"and you revisit Sandra Bland and Trayvon and all of these,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,608860,611110,and Ahmaud Arbery and all of these different things
JC-qGzTIpEo,611110,612470,that were happening right under our nose
JC-qGzTIpEo,612470,613871,and the rage starts to build up.
JC-qGzTIpEo,613871,615050,"It was hard for me to ignore then,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,615050,616290,"it was hard for me to ignore now,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,616290,620000,"so it was like, as much as I wanted to just be"
JC-qGzTIpEo,621120,624270,the black Yohji Yamamoto and not have my race
JC-qGzTIpEo,624270,629270,"show up in my work, I can't because it was like the world"
JC-qGzTIpEo,629570,632610,"outside of Milk Studios or Spring Studios,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,632610,633640,"wherever I was showing my show,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,633640,635870,"was still treating me like what the fuck I am,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,635870,639940,which is a black man from Brooklyn
JC-qGzTIpEo,639940,643520,"who, for the most part, people don't respect"
JC-qGzTIpEo,643520,646263,until they learn what I do.
JC-qGzTIpEo,647450,649040,What I love most about this moment
JC-qGzTIpEo,649040,650279,is that everybody's paying attention.
JC-qGzTIpEo,650280,653560,"It's hard to ignore now what's going on, right?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,653560,658090,Our lives have unilaterally been put on break
JC-qGzTIpEo,659170,661459,"and we have to open our eyes, we have to look now."
JC-qGzTIpEo,661460,663010,What we have to do now as creatives
JC-qGzTIpEo,663010,666160,is think about how many systems we've been buying into
JC-qGzTIpEo,666160,668690,and how many of them we can successfully destroy.
JC-qGzTIpEo,668690,672220,There's so many different nuanced conversations
JC-qGzTIpEo,672220,674430,"that happen around capitalism, and if you look"
JC-qGzTIpEo,674430,676300,"at just the fashion industry alone,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,676301,678150,the fashion industry embodies
JC-qGzTIpEo,678150,679720,everything wrong with capitalism.
JC-qGzTIpEo,679720,683100,"It's that you have this 1% that controls most of the wealth,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,683100,686290,"most of the resources, most of the means of production,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,686290,690290,"the leadership roles, et cetera, and fashion embodies that."
JC-qGzTIpEo,690290,691139,"They've done what they've done,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,691140,692100,"they've built what they've built,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,692100,694430,"and they have the right to maintain that,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,694430,696960,but we don't need that anymore.
JC-qGzTIpEo,696960,700950,We're stuck in this rut of we have to do things the old way
JC-qGzTIpEo,700950,704480,and the old way doesn't fucking work.
JC-qGzTIpEo,704480,708209,"I just want you to think, what systems are you buying into?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,708210,711090,"What are you innovating, versus what are you emulating?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,711090,714350,Fashion's role right now is to observe
JC-qGzTIpEo,715490,720490,"and come up with solutions for problems,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,722190,727190,"and we control image, but more importantly,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,728000,729520,we control self esteem.
JC-qGzTIpEo,729520,732850,And I think that's where we can really find our way
JC-qGzTIpEo,732850,737490,"as an industry, is to really think about this new world,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,737490,739576,"this post COVID understanding of empathy,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,739576,744089,this post George Floyd world of understanding of empathy
JC-qGzTIpEo,744090,748240,and seeing where we fit in to continue to build off
JC-qGzTIpEo,748240,750331,those morals that we're collectively
JC-qGzTIpEo,750331,752383,and consciously coming into.
JC-qGzTIpEo,753570,758570,I don't want all of us to always be dependent on some prize
JC-qGzTIpEo,759610,761180,or some award or something like that
JC-qGzTIpEo,761180,763339,to kind of level the playing field with us.
JC-qGzTIpEo,763340,766765,"We don't need that, and no one person is gonna fix it."
JC-qGzTIpEo,766765,769470,We just gotta buy out of that system.
JC-qGzTIpEo,769470,771519,If the stores are discounting your shit
JC-qGzTIpEo,772800,774100,and not giving you a fair shake
JC-qGzTIpEo,774100,776277,and giving you the opportunity to incubate
JC-qGzTIpEo,776277,780423,"and mature your brand, don't fucking go."
JC-qGzTIpEo,781340,785130,We will be releasing our campaign in a few weeks
JC-qGzTIpEo,785130,787850,"and we found a way to include the community,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,787850,792735,so we did an open studio and we had all of our fans write in
JC-qGzTIpEo,792736,795090,and just tell us why they wanted to be part
JC-qGzTIpEo,795090,796800,"of our open studio, and what we're gonna do"
JC-qGzTIpEo,796800,800010,is just use our fans as a subject for our campaign
JC-qGzTIpEo,800010,802820,and we're pasting them all around the world.
JC-qGzTIpEo,802820,804810,The PMR show will be part
JC-qGzTIpEo,804810,807470,"of other Your Friends in New York initiatives,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,807470,809480,so we wanna make sure all of those things
JC-qGzTIpEo,809480,810399,can happen succinctly.
JC-qGzTIpEo,810400,814136,"I think what we do is always unpredictable,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,814136,816357,but always on time.
JC-qGzTIpEo,816357,818857,[dance music]
JC-qGzTIpEo,821420,823899,"- Over the last five months, the social justice uprising"
JC-qGzTIpEo,823900,825620,has made very clear that young people
JC-qGzTIpEo,825620,827210,are voting with their wallets.
JC-qGzTIpEo,827210,828800,"In the third segment this week,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,828800,830339,we're speaking to a number of people
JC-qGzTIpEo,830340,833690,who skillfully use fashion as a platform for activism.
JC-qGzTIpEo,833690,835920,Let's talk to Hannah Stoudemire and Ali Richmond
JC-qGzTIpEo,835920,838750,"of Fashion For All, Celine Semaan of Slow Factory"
JC-qGzTIpEo,838750,841140,and author Kimberly Drew about why their work
JC-qGzTIpEo,841140,842783,is more impactful now than ever.
JC-qGzTIpEo,848820,851670,- Fashion activism is a term I coined early
JC-qGzTIpEo,851670,853393,as I started Slow Factory.
JC-qGzTIpEo,854520,858380,It was the idea that fashion can be a vehicle for change.
JC-qGzTIpEo,858380,861600,"Fashion creates meaning, and meaning creates culture."
JC-qGzTIpEo,861600,863240,"If the public is aware of something,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,863240,865423,it can move policies forward.
JC-qGzTIpEo,866520,870940,Slow Factory is a not-for-profit working at the intersection
JC-qGzTIpEo,870940,873423,of human rights and climate justice.
JC-qGzTIpEo,875580,877780,We are upstate in Nyack.
JC-qGzTIpEo,877780,879870,We decided to move in nature
JC-qGzTIpEo,879870,882710,because we are always talking about bridging the gap
JC-qGzTIpEo,882710,885913,between urban and rural areas.
JC-qGzTIpEo,888350,891149,We work with the public as a public service
JC-qGzTIpEo,891150,894290,"in open education and designing new systems,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,894290,897509,equity at the heart of our strategies
JC-qGzTIpEo,897510,898900,"and our work with brands,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,898900,902560,"and trying to create this intersectional way of thinking,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,902560,905540,from climate to human rights to fashion to style
JC-qGzTIpEo,905540,907899,to personal expression.
JC-qGzTIpEo,907900,910703,All these things are connected and they drive change.
JC-qGzTIpEo,912730,914730,- I was always a kid who was reading the magazines
JC-qGzTIpEo,914730,916230,and really enthused and thinking
JC-qGzTIpEo,916230,918899,"about modes of presentation through fashion,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,918900,921120,"but around six years ago, I concretely became a part"
JC-qGzTIpEo,921120,923227,"of the industry of fashion,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,923227,925740,which has been quite an interesting ride.
JC-qGzTIpEo,925740,930270,"I think today, I've been able to hare my own interests"
JC-qGzTIpEo,930270,933230,"as an activist and a critical thinker,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,933230,934810,trying to push brands as they're thinking
JC-qGzTIpEo,934810,937490,"about working more inclusively,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,937490,938890,"thinking more future forward,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,938890,941230,thinking more sustainably on many different levels.
JC-qGzTIpEo,941230,945930,There's something that's so powerful in the confidence
JC-qGzTIpEo,945930,949960,around self that makes fashion so powerful.
JC-qGzTIpEo,949960,951427,"I think all the time,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,951427,954867,"""I can do anything if I like how I look."
JC-qGzTIpEo,954867,957497,"""I could start a movement if I like how I look,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,957497,960320,"""if I feel like my truest self."""
JC-qGzTIpEo,960320,962950,"I'll speak more articulately, more powerfully."
JC-qGzTIpEo,962950,967590,And so I think that the ability to adorn everyone
JC-qGzTIpEo,967590,969330,"of all walks of life, of all roles,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,969330,972223,I think is a really critical role that fashion plays.
JC-qGzTIpEo,974670,978269,"- In 2016, I staged a Black Lives Matter protest"
JC-qGzTIpEo,978270,981303,to speak out against the racial injustices happening
JC-qGzTIpEo,981303,985380,and the unlawful killings of unarmed black men and women.
JC-qGzTIpEo,985380,988640,"The very next day, we brainstormed and we created"
JC-qGzTIpEo,988640,990695,Fashion For All Foundation.
JC-qGzTIpEo,990695,991528,- We would have these conversations
JC-qGzTIpEo,991528,992927,"and what I said to Hannah, I said,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,992927,996137,"""Listen, the fashion industry, they don't care."
JC-qGzTIpEo,996137,997987,"""They don't care about people of color"
JC-qGzTIpEo,997987,998917,"""being murdered by cops."
JC-qGzTIpEo,998917,1000097,"""It has nothing to do with fashion"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1000097,1002187,"""from their vantage point, right?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1002187,1004787,"""Okay, let's figure something out"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1004787,1007407,"""and make the fashion industry more accountable"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1007407,1010217,"""for the practices and the stuff that's happening"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1010217,1011399,"""in the industry."""
JC-qGzTIpEo,1011400,1013900,"We work with fashion organizations,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1013900,1015923,institutions and brands.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1016860,1019200,"We also work with emerging designers,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1019200,1021070,"but more importantly to us,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1021070,1023600,we work with students that are eager.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1023600,1024646,We work with the youth.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1024646,1026623,We work with ages 12 to 24.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1027689,1030409,- Thank you guys so much for coming out
JC-qGzTIpEo,1030410,1033910,to the FFA fabric giveaway.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1033910,1037439,We had a lot of designers donate fabric to us
JC-qGzTIpEo,1037439,1040049,and we wanted to make sure that you had fabric
JC-qGzTIpEo,1040050,1042620,as young designers and emerging designers.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1042620,1044510,This is totally free.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1044510,1049100,It's enough for everybody to take two rolls of fabric.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1049100,1052929,"- The public has been, slowly but surely, disillusioned"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1052930,1055940,"by the fashion industry, by brands and their promises."
JC-qGzTIpEo,1055940,1059360,The public has started to ask questions and inquire
JC-qGzTIpEo,1059360,1062353,"and have this direct communication, thanks to social media."
JC-qGzTIpEo,1063810,1068140,"For policies to change, for brands to take a massive change,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1068140,1071490,"we need the public's pressure, the public awareness,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1071490,1074540,and that's where Slow Factory really invests our time
JC-qGzTIpEo,1074540,1077130,in educating the public with open education.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1077130,1079430,Having you guys on board is also an experiment
JC-qGzTIpEo,1079430,1082350,for all of us to better this experience.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1082350,1085110,So some people were saying we need to have
JC-qGzTIpEo,1085110,1088490,"more than one class, is that even possible?"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1088490,1089763,'Cause I know it's a lot.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1090900,1094930,- The consumer 100% has realized
JC-qGzTIpEo,1094930,1097240,that the power lies within them
JC-qGzTIpEo,1097240,1101520,because fashion has become way more democratized.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1101520,1104940,"It is happening in the streets, it's on the news,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1104940,1106649,"it's in every choice they make,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1106650,1108610,it's in every dollar that they spend.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1108610,1113299,"Every time they spend a dollar with a designer or a brand,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1113300,1116430,they're endorsing that brand and it's more pressure
JC-qGzTIpEo,1116430,1120120,"on these brands and corporations, now more than ever,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1120120,1124160,to rise to the occasion and rise to the expectation
JC-qGzTIpEo,1124160,1125810,of the consumers.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1125810,1128760,"- There's this old saying, I think from the 1960s,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1128760,1131290,"that's like, ""Don't shop anywhere that wouldn't hire you."""
JC-qGzTIpEo,1131290,1133550,We have to continue to think those ways
JC-qGzTIpEo,1133550,1135830,and abstain from places that aren't complying
JC-qGzTIpEo,1135830,1137423,to these shifts and changes.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1140401,1142901,[light music]
JC-qGzTIpEo,1148090,1149289,- I love what's happening.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1149290,1153420,I just hope that the consumer realize their full potential
JC-qGzTIpEo,1153420,1155360,and their full power.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1155360,1159470,It's gonna be very scary when the consumer finally wakes up
JC-qGzTIpEo,1159470,1161167,"and says, ""You know what, I don't need any of this."
JC-qGzTIpEo,1161167,1162387,"""I can make it myself."
JC-qGzTIpEo,1162387,1163760,"""I can buy vintage."""
JC-qGzTIpEo,1163760,1165820,We just want the consumer to continue
JC-qGzTIpEo,1165820,1167240,to exercise their power.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1167240,1170510,"- We are existing now in an era of activism,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1170510,1174740,"in an era of revolution, in an era of global uprising,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1174740,1176220,and it's not just a moment.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1176220,1178299,What's going on right now is not a moment.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1178300,1181400,"We are in the epoch of climate change,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1181400,1183870,in the epoch of social uprising.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1183870,1186400,So fashion plays a tremendous role in all of this.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1186400,1187880,Essentially what it teaches us
JC-qGzTIpEo,1187880,1189433,is that things need to change.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1193410,1196040,"- Let's go, let's see that change happen."
JC-qGzTIpEo,1196040,1196993,We want it.
JC-qGzTIpEo,1198516,1201016,[light music]
JC-qGzTIpEo,1208710,1210299,"- That's a wrap on New York Fashion Week,"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1210300,1212080,"but come back Monday, when Good Morning Vogue"
JC-qGzTIpEo,1212080,1212913,will be in London.
