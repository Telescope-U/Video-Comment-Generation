yQnqjjCgf0U,11200,13599,gonna be like fun this video is all
yQnqjjCgf0U,13599,16480,about these i found these pens they're
yQnqjjCgf0U,16480,18080,so dumb
yQnqjjCgf0U,18080,20480,i can already tell they're so dumb
yQnqjjCgf0U,20480,22720,they're called amazing they literally
yQnqjjCgf0U,22720,24880,put amazing as part of the title so
yQnqjjCgf0U,24880,28720,that's a good start right amazing magic
yQnqjjCgf0U,28720,33040,okay amazing magic amazing magic pens
yQnqjjCgf0U,33040,34719,i don't have anything to say about pens
yQnqjjCgf0U,34719,36480,what do they do i honestly don't even
yQnqjjCgf0U,36480,39360,really know yet i bought them on amazon
yQnqjjCgf0U,39360,40800,they popped up and i was like amazing

yQnqjjCgf0U,43760,45440,i want some amazing magic pens i'm gonna
yQnqjjCgf0U,45440,48160,take a whole video and just try to make
yQnqjjCgf0U,48160,50160,something decent if they're so amazing
yQnqjjCgf0U,50160,52000,and magic it shouldn't be that difficult
yQnqjjCgf0U,52000,53840,i suspect they're not gonna be as
yQnqjjCgf0U,53840,55440,amazing and magic as the title would
yQnqjjCgf0U,55440,57840,suggest but my goal here is not to
yQnqjjCgf0U,57840,59440,complain about this product or to tell
yQnqjjCgf0U,59440,60879,you to buy it or not to buy it or
yQnqjjCgf0U,60879,62079,whatever i don't know i don't know
yQnqjjCgf0U,62079,63440,anything about this i obviously just
yQnqjjCgf0U,63440,65198,picked it up randomly my goal is just to
yQnqjjCgf0U,65198,66799,take something that i'm unfamiliar with
yQnqjjCgf0U,66799,70640,that may or may not suck and try my best
yQnqjjCgf0U,70640,73520,to make something good with it
yQnqjjCgf0U,73520,74960,i almost dropped them i guess we'll just
yQnqjjCgf0U,74960,76799,get into kind of exploring these and
yQnqjjCgf0U,76799,78159,what they do and trying to make
yQnqjjCgf0U,78159,80479,something let's do it all right laying
yQnqjjCgf0U,80479,82960,down my surface to get started and here
yQnqjjCgf0U,82960,85840,they are the stars of the show the
yQnqjjCgf0U,85840,89280,amazing magic pens how many times am i
yQnqjjCgf0U,89280,91280,gonna say that oh wait marvin's amazing
yQnqjjCgf0U,91280,93840,magic pens who's marvin so let's open
yQnqjjCgf0U,93840,95360,these boys up
yQnqjjCgf0U,95360,97119,smell that smells like a cheap gimmick
yQnqjjCgf0U,97119,99520,but hey i bought them so who's the fool
yQnqjjCgf0U,99520,102159,here here's one up close um okay looks
yQnqjjCgf0U,102159,104240,like a regular marker to me it doesn't
yQnqjjCgf0U,104240,106960,feel magical maybe it works like a wand
yQnqjjCgf0U,106960,109920,come on bippity bop bop bippy pop up did
yQnqjjCgf0U,109920,113600,it work am i pretty yet oh okay oh it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,113600,115200,dirty i'm getting a little bit worried
yQnqjjCgf0U,115200,116960,about a false advertisement situation
yQnqjjCgf0U,116960,118799,because no magic is happening so i
yQnqjjCgf0U,118799,120560,brought back the box to see if i could
yQnqjjCgf0U,120560,122799,decipher this very complex code
yQnqjjCgf0U,122799,125360,basically they're color changing i do
yQnqjjCgf0U,125360,127439,remember seeing things like this when i
yQnqjjCgf0U,127439,129840,was a kid but i never actually had or
yQnqjjCgf0U,129840,132160,used anything like this before the box
yQnqjjCgf0U,132160,133680,does explain everything but i'm just
yQnqjjCgf0U,133680,136239,gonna kind of explore on my own okay so
yQnqjjCgf0U,136239,139120,let's see orange marker orange ink okay
yQnqjjCgf0U,139120,142080,i'm following pink marker pink ink okay
yQnqjjCgf0U,142080,144160,what if you combine them any magic no
yQnqjjCgf0U,144160,146000,what about the purple marker do you
yQnqjjCgf0U,146000,149280,believe in magic no it's fake also why
yQnqjjCgf0U,149280,151519,does the purple look almost identical to
yQnqjjCgf0U,151519,153440,the pink
yQnqjjCgf0U,153440,155920,it's not only unmagical that's a crime
yQnqjjCgf0U,155920,158239,tried the green pen nothing again until
yQnqjjCgf0U,158239,160959,i brought out the white pen i didn't see
yQnqjjCgf0U,160959,163440,this before suddenly
yQnqjjCgf0U,163440,164400,oh
yQnqjjCgf0U,164400,165280,oh
yQnqjjCgf0U,165280,167920,okay it's happening it's happening so
yQnqjjCgf0U,167920,170239,the white pens are the magical ones it
yQnqjjCgf0U,170239,172160,took me way too long to figure that out
yQnqjjCgf0U,172160,174959,now i get it i'm smart just call me
yQnqjjCgf0U,174959,178319,professor watch as this purple ink turns
yQnqjjCgf0U,178319,181840,to green oh oh gosh that's cool what
yQnqjjCgf0U,181840,184080,happens if i put the magic down first
yQnqjjCgf0U,184080,186319,and then put the color on oh okay so it
yQnqjjCgf0U,186319,188959,works both ways science in this pack we
yQnqjjCgf0U,188959,191519,have 10 of these two-tone markers plus
yQnqjjCgf0U,191519,193200,two duplicate colors why didn't they
yQnqjjCgf0U,193200,195200,give us 12 unique colors instead of the
yQnqjjCgf0U,195200,196640,duplicates i'll bet that was marvin's
yQnqjjCgf0U,196640,199040,fault thanks marvin so we have black or
yQnqjjCgf0U,199040,200879,what is supposed to be black it's really
yQnqjjCgf0U,200879,203280,more of a dark blue this weird brown
yQnqjjCgf0U,203280,206000,another dark blue medium blue purple
yQnqjjCgf0U,206000,207840,another purple another purple that's
yQnqjjCgf0U,207840,210480,actually pink magenta really green red
yQnqjjCgf0U,210480,212879,and orange quite an interesting
yQnqjjCgf0U,212879,214720,arrangement of colors as you may have
yQnqjjCgf0U,214720,216560,guessed the color of the ink matches the
yQnqjjCgf0U,216560,218879,base of the pen when you add marvin
yQnqjjCgf0U,218879,220959,magic it changes to the color that's on
yQnqjjCgf0U,220959,223280,the cap so let's test all of these out
yQnqjjCgf0U,223280,224480,oh
yQnqjjCgf0U,224480,227200,i feel the magic that's actually really
yQnqjjCgf0U,227200,229519,fun to do so these are the crazy ones
yQnqjjCgf0U,229519,231840,and then there's the more toned down
yQnqjjCgf0U,231840,233920,sisters and for some reason there are
yQnqjjCgf0U,233920,236480,again duplicates of two of the colors
yQnqjjCgf0U,236480,239439,instead of just making all unique colors
yQnqjjCgf0U,239439,241680,ow i hate the painful sneezes the
yQnqjjCgf0U,241680,243360,difference between these markers and the
yQnqjjCgf0U,243360,245200,two-tone ones is that when you use the
yQnqjjCgf0U,245200,247519,magic marker over these they just turn
yQnqjjCgf0U,247519,250000,white so that's cool okay there's a lot
yQnqjjCgf0U,250000,252239,here the thing that's troublesome for me
yQnqjjCgf0U,252239,254560,is that there's no system the colors
yQnqjjCgf0U,254560,256560,that are provided are very random the
yQnqjjCgf0U,256560,258959,colors that they change to are even more
yQnqjjCgf0U,258959,261359,random which is going to make planning a
yQnqjjCgf0U,261359,263759,drawing with these very difficult which
yQnqjjCgf0U,263759,266320,is why i continued to stall eventually i
yQnqjjCgf0U,266320,268240,realized whatever i make with these it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,268240,270479,going to look totally whack so let's
yQnqjjCgf0U,270479,273120,just try to embrace the whack so i'm
yQnqjjCgf0U,273120,275120,lightly sketching out my design i wanted
yQnqjjCgf0U,275120,276720,to do something simple enough that i
yQnqjjCgf0U,276720,278880,could complete it using these markers
yQnqjjCgf0U,278880,280880,but detailed enough that it's not too
yQnqjjCgf0U,280880,283520,easy or boring also gotta keep in mind
yQnqjjCgf0U,283520,285680,this is gonna be using some outrageous
yQnqjjCgf0U,285680,287680,colors so something that is going to
yQnqjjCgf0U,287680,291040,look decent in a very colorful form so i
yQnqjjCgf0U,291040,293360,very lightly sketched out my design you
yQnqjjCgf0U,293360,295360,can't really see it oh good it'll be a
yQnqjjCgf0U,295360,297840,surprise get excited but also manage
yQnqjjCgf0U,297840,300320,your expectations okay please i'm laying
yQnqjjCgf0U,300320,302400,out all my colors for the background i'm
yQnqjjCgf0U,302400,304560,gonna go for a gradient look so i'm
yQnqjjCgf0U,304560,306400,figuring out the best way to order them
yQnqjjCgf0U,306400,308639,and here we go now these markers don't
yQnqjjCgf0U,308639,311280,really blend um but i try to force them
yQnqjjCgf0U,311280,314080,to anyway by creating scraggly little
yQnqjjCgf0U,314080,316160,edges just to try to soften the line
yQnqjjCgf0U,316160,317840,between colors and make them look like
yQnqjjCgf0U,317840,319360,they're kind of blended together one of
yQnqjjCgf0U,319360,321120,the struggles i had with planning this
yQnqjjCgf0U,321120,323600,drawing is that all the colors are so
yQnqjjCgf0U,323600,326720,strong there's no light colors or softer
yQnqjjCgf0U,326720,328800,colors so it's going to be a very
yQnqjjCgf0U,328800,331840,intense drawing also i forgot how
yQnqjjCgf0U,331840,334800,splotchy markers are look at that it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,334800,336639,ugly but of course that's unavoidable
yQnqjjCgf0U,336639,338160,which makes me a little crazy because
yQnqjjCgf0U,338160,340400,this is supposed to be a nice relaxing
yQnqjjCgf0U,340400,342479,sunset gradient but instead it's a
yQnqjjCgf0U,342479,346080,gradient of intensity and chaos i
yQnqjjCgf0U,346080,347440,thought about bringing in some other
yQnqjjCgf0U,347440,350320,supplies to help out a little bit like
yQnqjjCgf0U,350320,352240,maybe i could have done the background
yQnqjjCgf0U,352240,354240,in watercolor and that would really help
yQnqjjCgf0U,354240,356880,soften the background at least but i i
yQnqjjCgf0U,356880,358560,figure you know if we're gonna do this
yQnqjjCgf0U,358560,360960,let's go all in okay and you can see the
yQnqjjCgf0U,360960,362800,outline of my drawing is starting to be
yQnqjjCgf0U,362800,364720,revealed you can kind of see what's
yQnqjjCgf0U,364720,366800,happening here oh boy now that i've
yQnqjjCgf0U,366800,368720,added the orange it looks like
yQnqjjCgf0U,368720,371360,everything is on fire oh the bottom was
yQnqjjCgf0U,371360,373360,supposed to be this peachy color but
yQnqjjCgf0U,373360,375919,once i put that down i decided i really
yQnqjjCgf0U,375919,378080,kind of hated it so then i panicked and
yQnqjjCgf0U,378080,381199,added orange and red at the bottom
yQnqjjCgf0U,381199,383199,um and now it really looks like we've
yQnqjjCgf0U,383199,385759,got a group of desserts in the fiery
yQnqjjCgf0U,385759,387759,furnace i tried to soften this up a
yQnqjjCgf0U,387759,390400,little bit didn't really work uh i went
yQnqjjCgf0U,390400,392800,over all the peach with the orange and
yQnqjjCgf0U,392800,394960,yellow markers oh except there i missed
yQnqjjCgf0U,394960,397280,a spot oh it's gonna distract me now the
yQnqjjCgf0U,397280,399440,background is done i'm erasing pretty
yQnqjjCgf0U,399440,401120,much all the pencil lines on here
yQnqjjCgf0U,401120,402560,because i definitely don't want those
yQnqjjCgf0U,402560,404080,showing through the markers and making
yQnqjjCgf0U,404080,406080,everything look messy and here we go
yQnqjjCgf0U,406080,408000,with the coloring i'm not gonna outline
yQnqjjCgf0U,408000,409520,this drawing i think it probably would
yQnqjjCgf0U,409520,412000,have looked better if i had but my goal
yQnqjjCgf0U,412000,414160,is to create something using only the
yQnqjjCgf0U,414160,416000,magic of the pens it's not gonna be the
yQnqjjCgf0U,416000,417919,best looking art that you've ever seen
yQnqjjCgf0U,417919,420080,unless you've never seen art ever in
yQnqjjCgf0U,420080,422639,your life so i've got this pink popsicle
yQnqjjCgf0U,422639,424800,and i'm using the magic marker to add
yQnqjjCgf0U,424800,428000,some white details on it and hey that's
yQnqjjCgf0U,428000,431280,pretty cool actually wow the popsicle
yQnqjjCgf0U,431280,433440,came out really cute and pretty normal
yQnqjjCgf0U,433440,435360,looking too bad it's in a burning
yQnqjjCgf0U,435360,438080,furnace for the next dessert i'm doing
yQnqjjCgf0U,438080,440400,brown for some chocolate sauce that's
yQnqjjCgf0U,440400,443120,nice and normal and then purple for the
yQnqjjCgf0U,443120,446319,dessert itself which is a cream puff and
yQnqjjCgf0U,446319,448560,watch this watch the magic i use the
yQnqjjCgf0U,448560,451440,marker to create the white cream filling
yQnqjjCgf0U,451440,453440,and just left the purple to be the
yQnqjjCgf0U,453440,456160,shadows see how i did that that's so
yQnqjjCgf0U,456160,458479,good i'm way too impressed that i
yQnqjjCgf0U,458479,460160,thought of that and then using the white
yQnqjjCgf0U,460160,462880,to add some little details around final
yQnqjjCgf0U,462880,465039,touch of magic is the sprinkles on the
yQnqjjCgf0U,465039,466960,chocolate sauce which turned into a
yQnqjjCgf0U,466960,469680,bright alien green definitely not the
yQnqjjCgf0U,469680,471919,color i would have chosen i think that's
yQnqjjCgf0U,471919,474000,part of the fun i did decide to add some
yQnqjjCgf0U,474000,475840,little friends into my desserts and
yQnqjjCgf0U,475840,477599,maybe you'll recognize this familiar
yQnqjjCgf0U,477599,479120,face actually it's not that familiar
yQnqjjCgf0U,479120,480800,because cousin derp doesn't normally
yQnqjjCgf0U,480800,482560,look like this but these markers don't
yQnqjjCgf0U,482560,484960,come in baby blue unfortunately i use
yQnqjjCgf0U,484960,487199,the magic marker for all of his details
yQnqjjCgf0U,487199,489919,um so it's kind of like cousin derp from
yQnqjjCgf0U,489919,492400,the underworld i did test with the other
yQnqjjCgf0U,492400,495280,blue option and this was the less creepy
yQnqjjCgf0U,495280,497440,believe it or not then moving from derp
yQnqjjCgf0U,497440,500240,to our beloved pickle looking a little
yQnqjjCgf0U,500240,502720,less than stellar but um
yQnqjjCgf0U,502720,505039,he's he's alive and pickle has found
yQnqjjCgf0U,505039,507680,himself inside of this lovely lavender
yQnqjjCgf0U,507680,510720,frosting i made the cupcake liner brown
yQnqjjCgf0U,510720,513039,like a chocolate cake but then the cake
yQnqjjCgf0U,513039,514959,color is actually not chocolate it's a
yQnqjjCgf0U,514959,517599,bright pink so the colors don't make all
yQnqjjCgf0U,517599,520800,that much sense but somehow it still
yQnqjjCgf0U,520800,523120,kind of looks okay next we have the ice
yQnqjjCgf0U,523120,525040,cream cone and this is where things get
yQnqjjCgf0U,525040,527680,real wild the cone is a normal color but
yQnqjjCgf0U,527680,529920,then we have this dripping
yQnqjjCgf0U,529920,531920,substance what flavor could that
yQnqjjCgf0U,531920,534240,possibly be and then some bright purple
yQnqjjCgf0U,534240,536080,ice cream definitely looks a little
yQnqjjCgf0U,536080,538320,crazy it may look like i'm just throwing
yQnqjjCgf0U,538320,540800,random colors on here but i actually did
yQnqjjCgf0U,540800,543040,plan this out and try to use the best
yQnqjjCgf0U,543040,545920,colors possible the red option was worse
yQnqjjCgf0U,545920,547760,the thing is i really wanted to use just
yQnqjjCgf0U,547760,550160,about every single color option in the
yQnqjjCgf0U,550160,552640,set and go all out for the last dessert
yQnqjjCgf0U,552640,554640,i did go nice and simple and did the
yQnqjjCgf0U,554640,557040,pink again for a cake roll with white
yQnqjjCgf0U,557040,559440,details and a little strawberry on top
yQnqjjCgf0U,559440,560959,then to give the background a little
yQnqjjCgf0U,560959,563360,magic i added some stars and little
yQnqjjCgf0U,563360,565440,spots of glitter around and it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,565440,567600,finished it's a lot of warm colors on
yQnqjjCgf0U,567600,569839,here a lot of pink and red and also
yQnqjjCgf0U,569839,571360,let's just point out it's not the most
yQnqjjCgf0U,571360,573279,amazing piece of art that i've ever seen
yQnqjjCgf0U,573279,575279,also how is that popsicle standing up by
yQnqjjCgf0U,575279,578080,itself magic i will say though using
yQnqjjCgf0U,578080,580560,these markers was actually a lot of fun
yQnqjjCgf0U,580560,582959,i thoroughly enjoyed the experience it
yQnqjjCgf0U,582959,585680,was easy pretty quick and you know it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,585680,587680,different so since this was pretty quick
yQnqjjCgf0U,587680,589600,i had a little extra time left over for
yQnqjjCgf0U,589600,591440,the week and i decided to go ahead and
yQnqjjCgf0U,591440,593120,do another one for the first round of
yQnqjjCgf0U,593120,594720,color i'm going to stick with using the
yQnqjjCgf0U,594720,597200,markers that just changed to white and
yQnqjjCgf0U,597200,599519,since my last one had a very reddish
yQnqjjCgf0U,599519,601440,vibe i'm going to switch it up and go
yQnqjjCgf0U,601440,603760,blue this time which blue to choose
yQnqjjCgf0U,603760,605040,they're all pretty much the same i'm
yQnqjjCgf0U,605040,608000,coloring the entire background blue and
yQnqjjCgf0U,608000,610640,man it's amazing how quickly you cover
yQnqjjCgf0U,610640,613279,some ground with markers geez compared
yQnqjjCgf0U,613279,616640,to paint or colored pencils oh it's like
yQnqjjCgf0U,616640,618800,lightening and as you can see by this
yQnqjjCgf0U,618800,621680,silhouette i'm drawing a bear it's gonna
yQnqjjCgf0U,621680,623600,be a purple bear now clearly the thing
yQnqjjCgf0U,623600,625120,about these markers is that they force
yQnqjjCgf0U,625120,627120,you to make some very interesting color
yQnqjjCgf0U,627120,628959,choices i kind of wanted to use the
yQnqjjCgf0U,628959,631120,brown to make a brown bear because i'm
yQnqjjCgf0U,631120,634240,basic but i just wasn't a fan of having
yQnqjjCgf0U,634240,637279,green details for my bear so i chose
yQnqjjCgf0U,637279,639120,purple instead i wanted to choose
yQnqjjCgf0U,639120,641040,something to draw that would work really
yQnqjjCgf0U,641040,642800,well with these pens and kind of
yQnqjjCgf0U,642800,644480,highlight all the fun things that they
yQnqjjCgf0U,644480,646800,can do so i decided to make a teddy bear
yQnqjjCgf0U,646800,648720,with a bunch of different patches that's
yQnqjjCgf0U,648720,650560,what all those empty squares are for i
yQnqjjCgf0U,650560,652320,went with that peach color for the bears
yQnqjjCgf0U,652320,654800,muzzle and tummy area which i'm still
yQnqjjCgf0U,654800,656720,not a huge fan of this color i don't
yQnqjjCgf0U,656720,658160,know why but it makes me a little bit
yQnqjjCgf0U,658160,660079,uneasy
yQnqjjCgf0U,660079,662399,i gave him a big red bow tie and some
yQnqjjCgf0U,662399,665040,nice pink ears and little feet and toes
yQnqjjCgf0U,665040,667040,now that there's nothing left to color
yQnqjjCgf0U,667040,669440,but the patches i'm breaking out the two
yQnqjjCgf0U,669440,671279,tone markers so we can get a little
yQnqjjCgf0U,671279,673200,crazy for this drawing i'm just going to
yQnqjjCgf0U,673200,675839,color the entire thing in completely
yQnqjjCgf0U,675839,678320,first and that way we can save the magic
yQnqjjCgf0U,678320,682160,for the very end and savor it okay it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,682160,685519,time for magic and this part was just
yQnqjjCgf0U,685519,687839,ugh the most fun i've ever had in my
yQnqjjCgf0U,687839,690240,entire life is that an exaggeration yeah
yQnqjjCgf0U,690240,691760,yeah for sure but
yQnqjjCgf0U,691760,694399,it was really fun okay honestly so i was
yQnqjjCgf0U,694399,696079,just kind of going for it and there was
yQnqjjCgf0U,696079,698320,just something so fun about using one
yQnqjjCgf0U,698320,700560,marker to achieve so many different
yQnqjjCgf0U,700560,703279,colors and watching them change oh it's
yQnqjjCgf0U,703279,704720,just so satisfying and you don't even
yQnqjjCgf0U,704720,706800,have to think about it it just happens
yQnqjjCgf0U,706800,709920,honestly this is such a gimmicky like
yQnqjjCgf0U,709920,712240,pointless product you know like let's be
yQnqjjCgf0U,712240,714639,honest who who really needs this
yQnqjjCgf0U,714639,716800,functionality in a marker but you
yQnqjjCgf0U,716800,719040,probably will have a lot of fun making
yQnqjjCgf0U,719040,721600,something you know cute and i like that
yQnqjjCgf0U,721600,723519,they kind of make you think differently
yQnqjjCgf0U,723519,725440,about what you're doing than just with a
yQnqjjCgf0U,725440,727600,regular drawing the only thing i would
yQnqjjCgf0U,727600,730160,say i really wish the colors were better
yQnqjjCgf0U,730160,732720,more variety more light tones you can
yQnqjjCgf0U,732720,735120,still have like the vibrant crazy ones
yQnqjjCgf0U,735120,737360,but like if you were able to mix those
yQnqjjCgf0U,737360,739920,with a little bit nicer prettier colors
yQnqjjCgf0U,739920,741680,it would just make the art so much
yQnqjjCgf0U,741680,744320,better anyway here's my bear and i think
yQnqjjCgf0U,744320,746720,it came out really cute i love all the
yQnqjjCgf0U,746720,749440,different patterns i mean it is a very
yQnqjjCgf0U,749440,752079,simple piece of art but i did most of
yQnqjjCgf0U,752079,754240,this drawing at like one o'clock in the
yQnqjjCgf0U,754240,756639,morning and i was still really enjoying
yQnqjjCgf0U,756639,758240,it even though it was in the middle of
yQnqjjCgf0U,758240,759120,the night and i probably should have
yQnqjjCgf0U,759120,761279,been sleeping so i really did love this
yQnqjjCgf0U,761279,763120,experience those are the two drawings
yQnqjjCgf0U,763120,765200,that i made completely with marvin's
yQnqjjCgf0U,765200,767519,amazing magical pens maybe it's because
yQnqjjCgf0U,767519,769760,i had such low expectations for these
yQnqjjCgf0U,769760,771760,but i did have a lot of fun even though
yQnqjjCgf0U,771760,773200,the art would probably look a lot
yQnqjjCgf0U,773200,775440,different if i had used more traditional
yQnqjjCgf0U,775440,777680,art supplies i do like how these came
yQnqjjCgf0U,777680,779519,out and what i was able to do with them
yQnqjjCgf0U,779519,781120,i hope you guys enjoyed watching this
yQnqjjCgf0U,781120,782560,thank you so much and i will see you
yQnqjjCgf0U,782560,784610,next week bye
