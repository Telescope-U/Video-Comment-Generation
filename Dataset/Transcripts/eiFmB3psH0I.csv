eiFmB3psH0I,10320,12160,who better to give you the ultimate walk
eiFmB3psH0I,12160,14320,around of the new range rover sport than
eiFmB3psH0I,14320,17119,auto express's sportiest member of staff
eiFmB3psH0I,17119,19920,so this is the new range rover sport i'm
eiFmB3psH0I,19920,22960,steve fowler this is auto express please
eiFmB3psH0I,22960,25039,hit the subscribe buttony thing or the
eiFmB3psH0I,25039,27279,belly button thing and
eiFmB3psH0I,27279,30279,enjoy
eiFmB3psH0I,32320,33840,you don't want me to tell you about this
eiFmB3psH0I,33840,35920,car not when i've got a superstar here
eiFmB3psH0I,35920,38160,mr hollywood he's a real life car
eiFmB3psH0I,38160,40640,designer not any old car designer he
eiFmB3psH0I,40640,43680,designed this very range rover sport jez
eiFmB3psH0I,43680,45280,do you want to just talk us through what
eiFmB3psH0I,45280,46399,you've been trying to do what's
eiFmB3psH0I,46399,48079,different to the old car and your
eiFmB3psH0I,48079,49760,favorite details of the new range rover
eiFmB3psH0I,49760,51760,sport gladly steve so when you walked
eiFmB3psH0I,51760,53520,over you mentioned about proportions
eiFmB3psH0I,53520,55520,being key and it's no different with
eiFmB3psH0I,55520,57680,this all new range rover sport it has
eiFmB3psH0I,57680,60399,that unmistakable range rover profile
eiFmB3psH0I,60399,63359,the short front overhang the gently
eiFmB3psH0I,63359,65920,falling roof line the strong continuous
eiFmB3psH0I,65920,68640,belt line and the gently swept up sill
eiFmB3psH0I,68640,71200,line but this car we've lengthened the
eiFmB3psH0I,71200,72960,wheelbase over the previous generation
eiFmB3psH0I,72960,75759,by about 75 millimeters and as well as
eiFmB3psH0I,75759,78880,giving better second row legroom it also
eiFmB3psH0I,78880,81520,gives a improved proportion to the car
eiFmB3psH0I,81520,84320,that combined with the 23-inch wheels
eiFmB3psH0I,84320,85840,and we've actually managed to get
eiFmB3psH0I,85840,87360,working with our engineering colleagues
eiFmB3psH0I,87360,90079,a shorter front overhang and that really
eiFmB3psH0I,90079,92000,stretches all those surfaces beautifully
eiFmB3psH0I,92000,93520,around that front wheel
eiFmB3psH0I,93520,96400,and maximizes that front uh wheel to
eiFmB3psH0I,96400,98720,body relationship of the front fender
eiFmB3psH0I,98720,99600,there
eiFmB3psH0I,99600,102159,then we've applied our reductive
eiFmB3psH0I,102159,104079,modernist design philosophy to this
eiFmB3psH0I,104079,106000,all-new range rover sport and just
eiFmB3psH0I,106000,108000,coming into some of the detailing there
eiFmB3psH0I,108000,110560,we have this beautifully flush glazing
eiFmB3psH0I,110560,112720,all through the side of the car there
eiFmB3psH0I,112720,115280,and we've deleted the waste finisher i
eiFmB3psH0I,115280,116960,love that you don't realize how much of
eiFmB3psH0I,116960,118799,a difference that makes it just removing
eiFmB3psH0I,118799,121280,that component there so part of this
eiFmB3psH0I,121280,123439,reductive modernist design philosophy is
eiFmB3psH0I,123439,125680,reducing components just reducing all
eiFmB3psH0I,125680,128160,that complexity and and pairing the car
eiFmB3psH0I,128160,130479,back and making it free from superfluous
eiFmB3psH0I,130479,132000,detailing so that's really helped us
eiFmB3psH0I,132000,134480,there and then working down the car this
eiFmB3psH0I,134480,136879,bonnet shut line we've managed to half
eiFmB3psH0I,136879,138720,it over the previous generation and
eiFmB3psH0I,138720,140560,that's allowed us to make this v-groove
eiFmB3psH0I,140560,142640,even more precise through the car and
eiFmB3psH0I,142640,145280,then the flush door handles again
eiFmB3psH0I,145280,147200,reducing any any visual clutter on the
eiFmB3psH0I,147200,149200,car tell me about the color this is a
eiFmB3psH0I,149200,151360,special color isn't it i love this color
eiFmB3psH0I,151360,153680,special color uh which we've put on this
eiFmB3psH0I,153680,156160,car to gauge reaction really but it
eiFmB3psH0I,156160,157680,really does just show that the
eiFmB3psH0I,157680,159360,beautifully sculpted surfacing the
eiFmB3psH0I,159360,161120,tension and all these lines the
eiFmB3psH0I,161120,163680,crispness but it is a color i very much
eiFmB3psH0I,163680,165680,do do likes i love it too it's not it's
eiFmB3psH0I,165680,166959,not for certain you'll be able to get it
eiFmB3psH0I,166959,168560,tell us in the comments if you like this
eiFmB3psH0I,168560,170400,color and they might do it
eiFmB3psH0I,170400,172160,tell us about the front so the front end
eiFmB3psH0I,172160,174560,it has that unmistakable range rover
eiFmB3psH0I,174560,177280,sport character it's very muscular it
eiFmB3psH0I,177280,179440,has an optimized stance and by that we
eiFmB3psH0I,179440,180159,mean
eiFmB3psH0I,180159,181760,distance of the wheel compared to the
eiFmB3psH0I,181760,183680,wheel arch there and really grounding
eiFmB3psH0I,183680,186080,the car giving it that visual stance
eiFmB3psH0I,186080,188800,then the the bonnet bulge very much a
eiFmB3psH0I,188800,191519,range rover sport character and these
eiFmB3psH0I,191519,193280,outboard features here on the bonnet
eiFmB3psH0I,193280,195519,again a range rover sport character very
eiFmB3psH0I,195519,197920,slim lights yeah moving down so this
eiFmB3psH0I,197920,199920,stealth-like lights and grill the
eiFmB3psH0I,199920,202159,all-new range rover grille and these
eiFmB3psH0I,202159,205440,digital led headlamps how many mirrors
eiFmB3psH0I,205440,207680,in there um
eiFmB3psH0I,207680,212799,1.3 million mirrors is amazing in
eiFmB3psH0I,212799,214560,the technology is just groundbreaking on
eiFmB3psH0I,214560,216319,this car combining that with a beautiful
eiFmB3psH0I,216319,218080,design and surfacing with all the
eiFmB3psH0I,218080,220640,graphics beautifully placed and flushed
eiFmB3psH0I,220640,222720,to the surfaces so no big offsets that
eiFmB3psH0I,222720,225360,gives it that reductive modern feeling
eiFmB3psH0I,225360,228400,and then as it is the sport moving down
eiFmB3psH0I,228400,230480,this black graphic with all the we
eiFmB3psH0I,230480,232239,cleverly put all the all the features in
eiFmB3psH0I,232239,234080,there so we don't break up the beautiful
eiFmB3psH0I,234080,236319,surfaces on the bumper but then it's a
eiFmB3psH0I,236319,238720,wide graphic which brings your eye out
eiFmB3psH0I,238720,240640,and then these outboard apertures down
eiFmB3psH0I,240640,242319,and these beautifully constructed
eiFmB3psH0I,242319,245200,surfaces here and then at the bottom
eiFmB3psH0I,245200,246799,this full width
eiFmB3psH0I,246799,249360,splitter in body color brings your eye
eiFmB3psH0I,249360,250480,down
eiFmB3psH0I,250480,252319,and again sort of amplifies that
eiFmB3psH0I,252319,254239,sporting character and this car is all
eiFmB3psH0I,254239,255040,about
eiFmB3psH0I,255040,256479,confidence and it really is the
eiFmB3psH0I,256479,258639,definition of sporting luxury i love the
eiFmB3psH0I,258639,261359,the visor reminds me of the cybermen in
eiFmB3psH0I,261359,262960,battlestar galactica you won't remember
eiFmB3psH0I,262960,264960,that but it's it's great i love that
eiFmB3psH0I,264960,266560,it's you know i think the pr the front
eiFmB3psH0I,266560,268880,end is is very proud and it um
eiFmB3psH0I,268880,270960,just does signify this is the new range
eiFmB3psH0I,270960,272320,rover sport let's have a look at the
eiFmB3psH0I,272320,274160,back you will see that we've moved the
eiFmB3psH0I,274160,276240,number plate down into the lower area of
eiFmB3psH0I,276240,278720,the of the car and that was intentional
eiFmB3psH0I,278720,281120,for two reasons one we wanted to keep
eiFmB3psH0I,281120,284000,this surface beautifully unadorned and
eiFmB3psH0I,284000,285440,not have the number plate in this in
eiFmB3psH0I,285440,287040,this upper area
eiFmB3psH0I,287040,288880,beautifully constructed surfacing here
eiFmB3psH0I,288880,290560,detailing and just bringing your
eiFmB3psH0I,290560,292560,attention to this line that comes down
eiFmB3psH0I,292560,293680,the car
eiFmB3psH0I,293680,296080,around the corner and along the bottom
eiFmB3psH0I,296080,297440,here just
eiFmB3psH0I,297440,299520,ending that beautiful crisp section all
eiFmB3psH0I,299520,301120,the way down the car
eiFmB3psH0I,301120,302400,and then the second reason for moving
eiFmB3psH0I,302400,303919,the number plate down is again that
eiFmB3psH0I,303919,306479,sporting character brings your eye down
eiFmB3psH0I,306479,309360,visually grounds the car and then this
eiFmB3psH0I,309360,312880,this wide lower valance housing exhausts
eiFmB3psH0I,312880,315120,again it's all to do with planting the
eiFmB3psH0I,315120,317360,car giving it that muscular sporting
eiFmB3psH0I,317360,319199,stance which we all love on the range
eiFmB3psH0I,319199,321199,rover sport and another visor on the
eiFmB3psH0I,321199,323440,back this full width black visor
eiFmB3psH0I,323440,326080,encompassing these beautiful surface led
eiFmB3psH0I,326080,327840,lights which i i really think are
eiFmB3psH0I,327840,330000,fantastic and as you move around the car
eiFmB3psH0I,330000,331759,you don't lose any of the intensity of
eiFmB3psH0I,331759,334639,this super red lamp this is this is uh
eiFmB3psH0I,334639,337120,this is quite a sizable rear spoiler i
eiFmB3psH0I,337120,338880,believe it is the biggest spoiler we've
eiFmB3psH0I,338880,341120,ever done that really android yeah right
eiFmB3psH0I,341120,343280,um and that really does um give you that
eiFmB3psH0I,343280,345199,real sporting character and just
eiFmB3psH0I,345199,348160,beautifully ends the roof that tapered
eiFmB3psH0I,348160,349680,falling roof i mentioned earlier with
eiFmB3psH0I,349680,351600,this with this fantastic spoiler i have
eiFmB3psH0I,351600,353120,i have one question i mean clearly it
eiFmB3psH0I,353120,355199,says sport there it's it's a range rover
eiFmB3psH0I,355199,357600,sport it's quite a squarish back end
eiFmB3psH0I,357600,360720,quite a vertical rear line to me it's
eiFmB3psH0I,360720,362720,just crying out for another version that
eiFmB3psH0I,362720,364319,might be a little bit more coupe like
eiFmB3psH0I,364319,366160,what do you reckon that might be coming
eiFmB3psH0I,366160,368400,along you'll have to wait and see
eiFmB3psH0I,368400,370560,i knew he'd say that i just knew it um
eiFmB3psH0I,370560,371680,thank you very much jess really
eiFmB3psH0I,371680,372880,appreciate it i'm gonna go and have a
eiFmB3psH0I,372880,374400,look inside thank you thank you lovely
eiFmB3psH0I,374400,376720,thank you
eiFmB3psH0I,379680,381280,i've got another design superstar in
eiFmB3psH0I,381280,383360,here to tell us about the interior this
eiFmB3psH0I,383360,385840,is tom he actually designed the interior
eiFmB3psH0I,385840,388000,of this car so we're gonna have a little
eiFmB3psH0I,388000,389280,chat
eiFmB3psH0I,389280,390880,about the interior of the new range
eiFmB3psH0I,390880,393360,rover sport so tom just just talk me
eiFmB3psH0I,393360,394800,through what you've done here that's uh
eiFmB3psH0I,394800,396160,that's different from the old range
eiFmB3psH0I,396160,398000,rover sport and how it kind of relates
eiFmB3psH0I,398000,399440,to the range rover as well so with the
eiFmB3psH0I,399440,400960,car we really wanted to keep that family
eiFmB3psH0I,400960,402720,bloodline to the range rover but we
eiFmB3psH0I,402720,404000,wanted to do a few different things to
eiFmB3psH0I,404000,406080,really differentiate it and separate the
eiFmB3psH0I,406080,408160,characters and give it its own its own
eiFmB3psH0I,408160,410240,personality yeah very much more of a
eiFmB3psH0I,410240,412160,engaging driver's car
eiFmB3psH0I,412160,413520,so we did that in a number of ways the
eiFmB3psH0I,413520,415360,most visible one is right here this the
eiFmB3psH0I,415360,416720,taller center constant quite high isn't
eiFmB3psH0I,416720,418080,it it is it's a lot higher than the
eiFmB3psH0I,418080,420720,normal range rover and rises vastly into
eiFmB3psH0I,420720,422240,the dash yep we took that same treatment
eiFmB3psH0I,422240,424319,of adding that acceleration to this um
eiFmB3psH0I,424319,425840,dashboard here again keeping the same
eiFmB3psH0I,425840,427440,family feel of the range rover but just
eiFmB3psH0I,427440,429120,accelerating that forward when you
eiFmB3psH0I,429120,430479,combine those two together you get this
eiFmB3psH0I,430479,432000,really nice flow from the center of the
eiFmB3psH0I,432000,434400,car all the way up and then holding
eiFmB3psH0I,434400,436639,there the new 134 inch screen we've now
eiFmB3psH0I,436639,438240,got a smaller steering wheel in here
eiFmB3psH0I,438240,440000,than the range rover yeah and about a 20
eiFmB3psH0I,440000,442240,mil low uh lower driving position
eiFmB3psH0I,442240,444400,sportier driving it is insane as soon as
eiFmB3psH0I,444400,446080,you get in the car it's a much more
eiFmB3psH0I,446080,448639,costed enveloping cabin-like feel to the
eiFmB3psH0I,448639,450400,car and there are some some nice touches
eiFmB3psH0I,450400,452160,to some of these detail materials and
eiFmB3psH0I,452160,453680,things as well that's right we've got a
eiFmB3psH0I,453680,455280,few new materials in here we just
eiFmB3psH0I,455280,456400,pointed out first there that's the
eiFmB3psH0I,456400,458160,forged carbon first time we featured
eiFmB3psH0I,458160,459680,that in a range of products using the
eiFmB3psH0I,459680,461599,center console here into the door cards
eiFmB3psH0I,461599,464319,as well and on the seats on the seats um
eiFmB3psH0I,464319,465520,yeah it's nice it does it feels
eiFmB3psH0I,465520,466879,absolutely funny it's not leather this
eiFmB3psH0I,466879,469039,is a man-made alternative yeah this is
eiFmB3psH0I,469039,471599,our pu from ultra fabrics yeah uh this
eiFmB3psH0I,471599,473039,car in particular is a great example of
eiFmB3psH0I,473039,475039,it we're covering every single surface
eiFmB3psH0I,475039,478639,so this is the the pu pu standing for
eiFmB3psH0I,478639,480000,polyurethane isn't it you're a
eiFmB3psH0I,480000,481919,polyurethane you've got to get a better
eiFmB3psH0I,481919,484080,name yeah i i think uh i think you
eiFmB3psH0I,484080,486400,should call it nomu
eiFmB3psH0I,486400,487599,because it's not it's not it's not
eiFmB3psH0I,487599,489680,leather it's not macau so it's novo but
eiFmB3psH0I,489680,491280,it's on the steering wheel as well yeah
eiFmB3psH0I,491280,492639,exactly even down to the touch points
eiFmB3psH0I,492639,494319,here on the gear shifter we've used
eiFmB3psH0I,494319,495440,absolutely everywhere and there's a
eiFmB3psH0I,495440,496960,different use of chrome isn't there sort
eiFmB3psH0I,496960,498560,of darker chrome and lighter that's
eiFmB3psH0I,498560,500400,right yeah on all the detail areas here
eiFmB3psH0I,500400,501840,we've got the moonlight chrome here on
eiFmB3psH0I,501840,504319,the end caps onto the finishes
eiFmB3psH0I,504319,506160,and everywhere we'd choose to finish off
eiFmB3psH0I,506160,507599,a detail in the car that's like a
eiFmB3psH0I,507599,509120,non-functional part if you like is
eiFmB3psH0I,509120,510800,treated in the moonlight chrome and that
eiFmB3psH0I,510800,512479,also complements really nicely with the
eiFmB3psH0I,512479,514560,noble chrome we've seen that before
eiFmB3psH0I,514560,516479,the latest range rover and we treat all
eiFmB3psH0I,516479,518399,our switch gear in that material so it
eiFmB3psH0I,518399,519839,differentiates the
eiFmB3psH0I,519839,521120,the decorative parts and functional
eiFmB3psH0I,521120,522800,parts of the interior it all feels more
eiFmB3psH0I,522800,524320,luxurious than the old range rover
eiFmB3psH0I,524320,525680,before that's something you're you're
eiFmB3psH0I,525680,527440,aiming for yeah right right from day one
eiFmB3psH0I,527440,529440,we really wanted to push that forward
eiFmB3psH0I,529440,531200,we're going to be you know closer than
eiFmB3psH0I,531200,533120,ever to range rover but at the same time
eiFmB3psH0I,533120,534320,more further apart as i mentioned in
eiFmB3psH0I,534320,536320,terms of character and and lots of tech
eiFmB3psH0I,536320,539839,as well digital dash 13.1 inch pv pro
eiFmB3psH0I,539839,543360,exactly and and 29 speakers including
eiFmB3psH0I,543360,546000,speakers in the in the headrests exactly
eiFmB3psH0I,546000,547760,yeah 29 speakers throughout the car two
eiFmB3psH0I,547760,548959,in each headrest the ones in the
eiFmB3psH0I,548959,550800,headdress automatically work out the
eiFmB3psH0I,550800,552320,noise cancellation in the car working
eiFmB3psH0I,552320,554320,with microphones uh certainly in the
eiFmB3psH0I,554320,556160,wheel arches they can cancel out those
eiFmB3psH0I,556160,558640,frequencies make a really calm place to
eiFmB3psH0I,558640,560560,be but they can actually then work
eiFmB3psH0I,560560,562399,together with inputs from the drivings
eiFmB3psH0I,562399,564080,you can actually hear the engine
eiFmB3psH0I,564080,566000,more loudly when you want to speak on
eiFmB3psH0I,566000,567279,the address yeah
eiFmB3psH0I,567279,569040,the spirited nature of the driving yeah
eiFmB3psH0I,569040,571120,fantastic i i think the interior is
eiFmB3psH0I,571120,572240,absolutely stunning you've done a
eiFmB3psH0I,572240,574080,fantastic job tom
eiFmB3psH0I,574080,575040,thank you very much appreciate it i'm
eiFmB3psH0I,575040,576480,going to go and talk about engines and
eiFmB3psH0I,576480,578510,exciting stuff like that now
eiFmB3psH0I,578510,584000,[Music]
eiFmB3psH0I,584000,585279,one thing i'm really excited about in
eiFmB3psH0I,585279,586720,this car is there's a plug-in hybrid
eiFmB3psH0I,586720,589440,version that will do not to 60 in 5.4
eiFmB3psH0I,589440,592000,seconds super quick and it'll go 80
eiFmB3psH0I,592000,593839,miles or thereabouts on electric power
eiFmB3psH0I,593839,596000,alone 80 grams per kilometer in terms of
eiFmB3psH0I,596000,598560,co2 if you're a company car taxpayer
eiFmB3psH0I,598560,600480,then you'll really like that so i think
eiFmB3psH0I,600480,602160,plug-in hybrid could be the one to go
eiFmB3psH0I,602160,603760,for if you don't want that there are 48
eiFmB3psH0I,603760,606480,volt mild hybrid petrol and diesel
eiFmB3psH0I,606480,608000,versions remember diesels yeah they're
eiFmB3psH0I,608000,609920,still going in a big car doing a lot of
eiFmB3psH0I,609920,611360,miles it might be the right thing for
eiFmB3psH0I,611360,614320,you or oh yes there's a v8 that'll do
eiFmB3psH0I,614320,616800,not to 60 in under five seconds now
eiFmB3psH0I,616800,618880,there's loads of clever technology under
eiFmB3psH0I,618880,621279,the skin four-wheel steer means this car
eiFmB3psH0I,621279,623760,has a turning circle of just 11 meters
eiFmB3psH0I,623760,625519,put that into context it's a whole two
eiFmB3psH0I,625519,627440,meters less than the old range rover
eiFmB3psH0I,627440,629839,sport quite handy in tight car parks and
eiFmB3psH0I,629839,631279,things like that loads of other
eiFmB3psH0I,631279,632959,technical gubbings all-terrain system
eiFmB3psH0I,632959,634640,with dynamic
eiFmB3psH0I,634640,636240,settings that will just make the car
eiFmB3psH0I,636240,639040,ride and handle really really well
eiFmB3psH0I,639040,642560,price wise starting price of around 79
eiFmB3psH0I,642560,644800,grand expensive a lot less on the
eiFmB3psH0I,644800,646640,monthlies and you should be able to get
eiFmB3psH0I,646640,648399,one by the end of the year so there you
eiFmB3psH0I,648399,650640,have it new range rover sport let us
eiFmB3psH0I,650640,652079,know what you think in the comments
