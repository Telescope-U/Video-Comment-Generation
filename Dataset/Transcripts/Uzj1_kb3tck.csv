Uzj1_kb3tck,10639,16800,we're coming on the air with a promise  from the fed chair that they are going  to get inflation back down but it's  going to take some time after the
Uzj1_kb3tck,16800,22080,highest single day interest rate hike  since the first playstation came out  we're going to break down what this
Uzj1_kb3tck,22080,28960,means for your wallet and for folks  having a tough time feeding their  families plus we're live on the ground  in montana after intense flooding
Uzj1_kb3tck,28960,34160,basically shut down the country's first  national park what we're hearing now  from the search and rescue efforts in
Uzj1_kb3tck,34160,39840,yellowstone and the january 6 committee  showing new video of a georgia  republican leading people on a tour of
Uzj1_kb3tck,39840,45360,the capitol one day before the  insurrection how congressman barry  loudermilk's responding now
Uzj1_kb3tck,45360,52000,plus with the number of abortions  increasing in the u.s for the first time  in 30 years we'll hear from someone in  texas who used a pill because of the
Uzj1_kb3tck,52000,58399,state's restrictive laws why that could  be a new normal in tonight's original  and that new scrutiny on tesla tonight
Uzj1_kb3tck,58399,65040,after a federal report shows way more  crashes with cars using that autopilot  system than we knew before the questions
Uzj1_kb3tck,65040,71760,that's now raising and  why ryan gosling in the new barbie movie  broke the internet today that's in the
Uzj1_kb3tck,71760,78479,five things later on in the show  hey i'm hallie and we're starting with  those interest rate hikes from the fed  we've been warning you about because now
Uzj1_kb3tck,78479,84799,they are here the highest single day  bump since the days when michael jordan  was playing baseball and friends first
Uzj1_kb3tck,84799,91439,showed up on tv oh yes the good old days  of 1994 in just the last couple hours  fed chair jerome powell is insisting
Uzj1_kb3tck,91439,97119,that even though he's lowering  expectations for the economy's growth  the fed's not seeing a bigger broader
Uzj1_kb3tck,97119,104240,batter slowdown  it's all about getting a handle on  inflation watch  the labor market is extremely tight and
Uzj1_kb3tck,104240,109920,inflation is much too high  we're not going to declare victory until  we see
Uzj1_kb3tck,109920,117040,a series of these you know really see  convincing evidence compelling evidence  that inflation is coming down
Uzj1_kb3tck,117040,123520,so there's the hike three quarters of a  point and this step is really basically  the only big tool the fed has to try to
Uzj1_kb3tck,123520,129360,lower prices and that's their goal right  to lower prices to make the numbers  you're seeing at the gas pump at the
Uzj1_kb3tck,129360,134640,grocery store at walmart go down  but the immediate impact is that  everything you see on your screen all
Uzj1_kb3tck,134640,139680,those things are going to cost more new  mortgages  new car loans credit cards maybe private
Uzj1_kb3tck,139680,145440,student loans  and these are costs that are already  high take a 400 000 home okay after the
Uzj1_kb3tck,145440,150560,first two fed rate hikes a new mortgage  went up by nearly 600 a month and with
Uzj1_kb3tck,150560,156560,mortgage rates now already the highest  in 14 years it's gonna get even higher  or look at a credit card if you've got
Uzj1_kb3tck,156560,161920,10 000 in credit card debt you could  have to pay 75 or more just in the  interest we're covering this from every
Uzj1_kb3tck,161920,167680,angle today stephanie rule is in for us  with the big breakdown jake ward has  more on the real world impact what it
Uzj1_kb3tck,167680,172959,means to all of us and carol lee is  posted up live at the white house let me  start with steph and steph do what you
Uzj1_kb3tck,172959,179920,do so well which is translate economic  ease into plain english for us right how  does the fed raising interest rates
Uzj1_kb3tck,179920,185040,lower the cost of everything else  okay the fed raises rates that means it
Uzj1_kb3tck,185040,191120,gets more expensive to borrow more  expensive for you you just set it to get  a car loan to get a mortgage more
Uzj1_kb3tck,191120,198000,expensive for businesses to borrow  remember they drop rates down to zero at  the height of covid because they wanted
Uzj1_kb3tck,198000,205200,to get the economy moving again now the  economy has gotten so hot they're trying  to slow it down the issue is if they
Uzj1_kb3tck,205200,211280,slow it down too much if they raise  rates too much then that stings the  economy and it could tip us into
Uzj1_kb3tck,211280,217360,recession so when we talk about what's  biden doing what's the administration  doing the administration let's be honest
Uzj1_kb3tck,217360,225200,cannot do that much the best chance we  have is the fed taking action which they  are here 75 basis points is a big move
Uzj1_kb3tck,225200,232080,but it doesn't mean it's going to work  and in the short term it's going to be  painful to see rates move up this much
Uzj1_kb3tck,232080,237680,you heard um jay powell steph dismissed  the idea of an economy that's already in  a slowdown even though we got some
Uzj1_kb3tck,237680,244879,numbers today that show americans are  changing their spending habits we are  all spending our money a little bit  differently retail sales are down by a
Uzj1_kb3tck,244879,250560,little percentage 0.3 percentage points  from last month even though it's up  overall um does this say to you that
Uzj1_kb3tck,250560,257440,people are worried about prices stuff  okay people are definitely worried about  prices they're talking about prices but
Uzj1_kb3tck,257440,264320,you i i see you i hear you on retail  sales but we haven't really our chan we  haven't really changed our behavior in a
Uzj1_kb3tck,264320,271600,big way just yet look at this summer  we're expecting a record-breaking travel  summer airline tickets people planning
Uzj1_kb3tck,271600,277680,to be on the road booking hotels because  there's all this pent-up demand from  from people who weren't be able to go
Uzj1_kb3tck,277680,283919,out because of covet so here's the thing  there's not a right or a wrong this is  the united states of america with a
Uzj1_kb3tck,283919,290800,really big really complicated economy  before covet we had the hads haves and  the have nots and now it's only gotten
Uzj1_kb3tck,290800,297199,worse so it's not like what's the  economy doing it's big and it's  complicated okay what do we look for
Uzj1_kb3tck,297199,303199,then what's the fed going to do next  right because powell is saying hey we're  not going to be more aggressive than  what we did today but there will be more
Uzj1_kb3tck,303199,309440,rate hikes down the road  there have to be but listen we weren't  expecting two weeks ago we didn't think
Uzj1_kb3tck,309440,314960,it would be 75 basis points we thought  it would be 50. then we got last week's  inflation number which really was a
Uzj1_kb3tck,314960,321600,shock to a lot of people that it was  still so high so he's got to be careful  here because the white house does or the
Uzj1_kb3tck,321600,327680,administration does have some egg on  their face because they were slow to  this party janet yellen and the
Uzj1_kb3tck,327680,334000,president did say it's transitory it's  transitory but i will say one thing in  defense of jay powell
Uzj1_kb3tck,334000,340320,nobody expected russia to invade ukraine  we did think that covid would be in the  rear view mirror and now what are the
Uzj1_kb3tck,340320,345919,two biggest drivers of inflation it's  gas prices it's food prices which we get
Uzj1_kb3tck,345919,352479,wheat and other grains from ukraine and  russia and obviously we get oil from  there that has pushed prices up gas is
Uzj1_kb3tck,352479,358240,one of the biggest drivers of inflation  and the fact that much of china has  still been shut down in lockdown because
Uzj1_kb3tck,358240,363919,of coven makes the supply chain issues  continue and six or nine months ago the  name of the game was we got to get
Uzj1_kb3tck,363919,369919,people back to work the supply chain has  to work its kinks out and that hasn't  happened yet we are making our way out
Uzj1_kb3tck,369919,375919,of that but jay powell he's in a tough  spot and so is this administration  stephanie rohl it's good to see you it's
Uzj1_kb3tck,375919,382240,good to see you at that breakdown always  appreciate it i want to bring in jake  ward now from oakland okay so jake steph  just laid out kind of the big picture
Uzj1_kb3tck,382240,387759,economic nuts and bolts if you will  but but the economy isn't just numbers  right the economy isn't about the
Uzj1_kb3tck,387759,394479,numbers it's about the people who live  in that economy and people like the  families that you're talking to today at  a food bank where you are
Uzj1_kb3tck,394479,400000,struggling when it's like do you put gas  in your car or food on your table
Uzj1_kb3tck,400319,406880,that's absolutely right hallie today was  a real eye opener for me spending time  at this food bank which literally just
Uzj1_kb3tck,406880,413440,finished its last  loading in at the trunk of a car  the numbers that they told us about at
Uzj1_kb3tck,413440,421039,the end of their shift here was since  about 9 00 a.m this morning to 1 30 p.m  they did about 1400 households worth of
Uzj1_kb3tck,421039,426160,food that's about 4  500 people who came through here needing
Uzj1_kb3tck,426160,432800,to basically get that small amount of  money off that week's grocery bill  out of their
Uzj1_kb3tck,432800,439199,worries and into something else maybe  it's diapers maybe it's gas when we  spoke to people here about why it is
Uzj1_kb3tck,439199,446160,that they needed to come here and get  free food this is how they described it  have a listen
Uzj1_kb3tck,446560,451840,it's really bad when you can't eat you  know when your stomach is hungry it's
Uzj1_kb3tck,451840,457599,bad this helps me a lot i have a  daughter that she's uh she's having a  baby
Uzj1_kb3tck,457599,464479,and so the resources that you that they  are providing is very  resourceful for the community
Uzj1_kb3tck,464479,471360,and for the to help the economy we're  already spending like 300 400 extra
Uzj1_kb3tck,471360,476720,a month than what we used to before  and then you look at the news
Uzj1_kb3tck,476720,485280,and statistics saying that it's going to  keep getting worse and it's overwhelming  like how much worse is it going to get
Uzj1_kb3tck,485840,491360,jess lee arias the woman you heard at  the end there the mother of two you know  that feeling that she describes that
Uzj1_kb3tck,491360,497199,overwhelmed feeling it turns out i mean  science has shown us that essentially  people who are living without food
Uzj1_kb3tck,497199,502960,security and in this county alameda  county that's one in four people are  essentially living with this extra
Uzj1_kb3tck,502960,510000,cognitive burden so not only does a  shelter like this sorry a food bank like  this help take off the the pressure of
Uzj1_kb3tck,510000,516240,having to spend the money on that and  take away the the worry that you're you  know you're not going to make your  calories for that week or not be able to
Uzj1_kb3tck,516240,521680,make your rent because you had to spend  money on calories it's also easing the  cognitive burden of all of this which
Uzj1_kb3tck,521680,526720,you can just see it in everyone's faces  here so everything you and steph were  describing a moment ago all of that very
Uzj1_kb3tck,526720,534080,very real on the ground here in oakland  what else jake has surprised you about  your reporting as you've been out on the  ground on this
Uzj1_kb3tck,534080,540640,well what's been extraordinary is to  look at this which one would look at as  something of a perhaps a federal or a
Uzj1_kb3tck,540640,546880,state or a regional service it's not  even though this is called alameda  county community food bank it's not run
Uzj1_kb3tck,546880,551920,by alameda county it's a donation and  volunteer based service and not only
Uzj1_kb3tck,551920,557360,that you know i mentioned that about  4500 people got their food here today  well this isn't a monthly thing this
Uzj1_kb3tck,557360,562959,isn't even a weekly thing they do this  three times a week and this is one of  400 agencies across this county that
Uzj1_kb3tck,562959,569200,does this we're talking hundreds of  thousands of people who need ongoing  assistance with food in order to not  have to spend that money that they
Uzj1_kb3tck,569200,575680,otherwise need to spend on diapers or  gas or rent and this place is absolutely
Uzj1_kb3tck,575680,582000,having to just spend way more money than  ever they said that back before the  pandemic 250 000 a month is what it cost
Uzj1_kb3tck,582000,587920,them to put food into people's mouths  now it's 1.5 million dollars a month and  here's the big thing that they're
Uzj1_kb3tck,587920,594080,worried about they're worried halle that  next month when the federal public  health decree which enabled all sorts of
Uzj1_kb3tck,594080,599680,things snap benefits and all sorts of  things to come to people that decree is  supposedly going to go away and with it
Uzj1_kb3tck,599680,606880,all these benefits how will they  continue to give food to people at the  time that they're obviously going to  need it more than ever hallie jake ward
Uzj1_kb3tck,606880,612959,live for us in oakland jake thank you  that sets up this conversation now with  carol lee outside the white house right  because for so many people right to get
Uzj1_kb3tck,612959,618079,to work to get to pick your kid up from  wherever you're able to have child care  if you have found child care you
Uzj1_kb3tck,618079,624079,probably have to get in a car right you  probably have to pay for gas in many  places around the country and you see  the latest numbers here we're above five
Uzj1_kb3tck,624079,630399,bucks a gallon right we know that we are  we've hit that milestone over the  weekend and i have this letter from  president biden to big oil companies
Uzj1_kb3tck,630399,637519,saying it's not acceptable  for these like big profit margins right  to get passed on to american families
Uzj1_kb3tck,637519,643839,for basically people to pay more for gas  so that big oil companies can make more  explain the goal here carol because
Uzj1_kb3tck,643839,650480,really  the president at this point has very few  unilateral options left available to him
Uzj1_kb3tck,650480,656000,to be able to get some relief to the  people like you just heard jake talking  about  right
Uzj1_kb3tck,656000,662480,that's absolutely right and look  the goal of this letter seems to really  be to shame these companies that's the
Uzj1_kb3tck,662480,669200,bottom line what we heard from the white  house press secretary just moments ago  for instance hallie was that these
Uzj1_kb3tck,669200,674880,companies have a patriotic duty not to  take advantage of the american people
Uzj1_kb3tck,674880,680959,during the time of war so that's the  position that they're taking on this  what the letter asks is that these
Uzj1_kb3tck,680959,686880,companies  cooperate with the administration to try  to figure out how to lower the price of
Uzj1_kb3tck,686880,693360,gas they call them out on their profits  the president does in this letter saying  that their profit margin is unacceptable
Uzj1_kb3tck,693360,698480,pointing out that in march gas was 4.25  cents a gallon and that was the last
Uzj1_kb3tck,698480,706079,time that oil was at 120 a barrel which  it is now and so they're basically  arguing how is that 75 cents increase in
Uzj1_kb3tck,706079,711360,the average price of gas happening if  they're not just out for profit so
Uzj1_kb3tck,711360,717920,they're trying to get these companies to  come and sit at the table and come up  with solutions to this problem and to
Uzj1_kb3tck,717920,723760,explain why they're not producing more  the problem that the administration has  as you mentioned is they don't have a
Uzj1_kb3tck,723760,729760,lot of tools here so it largely seems  like this could be more of a public  relations campaign as like i said the
Uzj1_kb3tck,729760,735279,press secretary saying that these  companies need to be doing their part  what does that look like and what does
Uzj1_kb3tck,735279,740560,that mean we don't know their the white  house is also saying things like the  press secretary mentioned the defense
Uzj1_kb3tck,740560,746560,production act could the president  invoke that to somehow lower the price  of gas to increase production that's not
Uzj1_kb3tck,746560,751760,it's not really clear exactly how that  would work in the white house and hasn't  said how serious they are about
Uzj1_kb3tck,751760,757360,something like that  carol lee outside the white house for us  carol thank you for that thanks for  being on top of that story for us
Uzj1_kb3tck,757360,763600,turning now to news out of the west  because the montana national guard says  it's had to rescue so far nearly 90
Uzj1_kb3tck,763600,769040,people from crazy intense floods at  yellowstone park it's so bad that the  governor of montana has declared a
Uzj1_kb3tck,769040,775120,statewide disaster  technically though it was the lieutenant  governor  acting as the acting governor who did
Uzj1_kb3tck,775120,780880,that because governor greg john forde we  found out late this afternoon he is not  in the country he's actually out of the
Uzj1_kb3tck,780880,787440,country on a personal trip with his wife  his office says he left before the  flooding happened he's working to get  back they say as quickly as possible get
Uzj1_kb3tck,787440,793200,back to the state  and it's a good thing because look at  this in billings a big water plant had  to be closed because levels got to more
Uzj1_kb3tck,793200,798639,than 16 feet  meaning it couldn't operate it can only  operate when it's 15 feet or below these
Uzj1_kb3tck,798639,804639,floods have washed away cabins swamped  small towns knocked out power  yellowstone overall was shut down
Uzj1_kb3tck,804639,809920,earlier this week right as the summer  tourist season was starting more than 10  000 people who were visiting had to
Uzj1_kb3tck,809920,816480,leave our miguel almaguer is on the  ground with more  the flood waters across this community
Uzj1_kb3tck,816480,823279,are finally starting to recede but not  everywhere some homes and businesses  even vehicles are under feet of water
Uzj1_kb3tck,823279,828880,now that damage most of it came  yesterday as widespread flooding  affected this area as well as
Uzj1_kb3tck,828880,836560,yellowstone national park some ten  thousand people from the park were  evacuated as rivers rose about five to
Uzj1_kb3tck,836560,843440,six feet in just 24 hours there were  several inches of rain that triggered  this widespread flooding but it was also
Uzj1_kb3tck,843440,849839,snow and melting runoff that really  contributed to the rising rivers all  across this region there were no
Uzj1_kb3tck,849839,856240,fatalities and no serious injuries but  we had mud slides rock slides bridges  that were washed away homes that were
Uzj1_kb3tck,856240,862399,washed away the damage and destruction  is widespread today authorities are  trying to access the roads into
Uzj1_kb3tck,862399,869360,yellowstone to determine exactly what is  still left standing the park remains  closed to visitors at least for today
Uzj1_kb3tck,869360,874399,and june's a very busy month for  yellowstone about 780 000 people visit
Uzj1_kb3tck,874399,880320,the park this month alone on average so  that's going to be a major delay for  folks who are trying to work their way
Uzj1_kb3tck,880320,887519,up here again the good news here no  major fatalities but a massive cleanup  is underway back to you
Uzj1_kb3tck,887519,893920,miguel almaguer in montana for us there  the shooter who allegedly killed 10  black people at a buffalo supermarket in
Uzj1_kb3tck,893920,899199,new york is now facing federal hate  crimes charges and those charges are  giving us some
Uzj1_kb3tck,899199,904480,new insight some disturbing new insight  about what happened in the shooting  investigators say this motive was to
Uzj1_kb3tck,904480,910480,quote prevent black people from  replacing white people and eliminating  the white race that's what they say
Uzj1_kb3tck,910480,917199,that this guy wanted to inspire others  to commit similar attacks they also say  that when the gunman got to the grocery  store and had started shooting he aimed
Uzj1_kb3tck,917199,923600,his rifle at a a white man a white male  employee who'd been shot and said sorry  to him before looking for more black
Uzj1_kb3tck,923600,929839,people to kill  the government says the suspect also  apologized to his family for the attack  and a note found by the fbi but said
Uzj1_kb3tck,929839,935440,it's something he had to do because he  cares quote for the future of the white  race  it comes as attorney general merrick
Uzj1_kb3tck,935440,941440,garland was in buffalo today you see him  here this is him laying down flowers at  a memorial near where the shooting
Uzj1_kb3tck,941440,947199,happened he also met with the families  of the people who were killed that day  well they were just going to the grocery  store while they were just going
Uzj1_kb3tck,947199,952639,shopping  pete williams is with us now pete can  you talk a little bit about the  significance of these hate crime charges
Uzj1_kb3tck,952639,959120,here they do carry the possibility of  the death penalty but of course that's  basically on pause right now right
Uzj1_kb3tck,959120,964320,right i think the difference is of  course he's already facing state charges  but new york is not a death penalty
Uzj1_kb3tck,964320,970160,state so the federal charges do carry  the maximum penalty of death and even  though it's not a death penalty state in
Uzj1_kb3tck,970160,977360,new york if he were convicted in the  federal system he could face the death  penalty  the question now is which will go first
Uzj1_kb3tck,977360,982959,will he'll go try on trial first in  state court or federal court i'm told  that no decision has been made on that
Uzj1_kb3tck,982959,988639,generally speaking the justice  department does hang back and let the  state take the first step here and then
Uzj1_kb3tck,988639,994399,can come in if there's some problem with  the state prosecution or the government  can go on its own the government
Uzj1_kb3tck,994399,1001920,actually went first in the charleston  church shooting in 2015 but no decision  has been made as i understand it here
Uzj1_kb3tck,1001920,1008560,what else should we know pete about the  the charge today and about what we heard  from merrick garland  well i think it's a it's certainly a
Uzj1_kb3tck,1008560,1015040,sign of how much the justice department  wants to concentrate on hate crimes  they've really upped the game on
Uzj1_kb3tck,1015040,1021279,prosecuting hate crimes and  investigating them they've set up a new  infrastructure inside the justice
Uzj1_kb3tck,1021279,1028240,department for handling hate crime cases  they've energized all the u.s attorneys  and fbi offices to be more aggressive
Uzj1_kb3tck,1028240,1034240,about looking for potential hate crimes  and bringing those charges when it makes  sense when the facts and the law fit the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1034240,1039760,case  so i think this is a symbolic gesture by  the attorney general i mean he cares
Uzj1_kb3tck,1039760,1046079,very much about this and he wanted to  demonstrate the justice department's  commitment here and also to show that uh
Uzj1_kb3tck,1046079,1053120,you know that the these be very serious  consequences if anyone is contemplating  this kind of racist attack
Uzj1_kb3tck,1053120,1058799,pete williams live for us on that pete  thank you  tonight staying in washington new video  released from the january 6 committee
Uzj1_kb3tck,1058799,1064160,shows a georgia congressman leading a  tour through house office buildings on  january 5th let's show you some of that
Uzj1_kb3tck,1064160,1069600,surveillance footage that the committee  released it shows  congressman loudermilk barry loudermilk
Uzj1_kb3tck,1069600,1075280,republican from georgia along with some  people in the group one who appears to  be wearing perhaps that signature red
Uzj1_kb3tck,1075280,1083679,hat that former president trump's  supporters often wear taking pictures of  things like hallways staircases etc
Uzj1_kb3tck,1083679,1089919,now ladder milk has denied any  wrongdoing capitol police has said in a  letter this tour was not suspicious  remember it happened on january 5th one
Uzj1_kb3tck,1089919,1096640,of the people on that tour was then  recorded  on a video outside the capitol on  january 6 making verbal threats against
Uzj1_kb3tck,1096640,1102960,top democrats  it comes as the january 6 select  committee tomorrow will try to make the  case that former president trump laid
Uzj1_kb3tck,1102960,1108640,the pressure on his then vice president  mike pence to try to get him to  overthrow the legitimate results of the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1108640,1114559,2020 election on january 6. i want to  bring in now ali rafa so ali we heard  our team i know your colleagues there on
Uzj1_kb3tck,1114559,1120880,the capitol hill caught up with  congressman loudermilk today basically  saying he didn't do anything wrong the  people he was with didn't do anything
Uzj1_kb3tck,1120880,1127120,wrong um and that he is not going to  talk with the january 6th select  committee right
Uzj1_kb3tck,1127360,1134160,that's right hallie he's saying that he  really didn't know this man that the  committee is saying that they have video
Uzj1_kb3tck,1134160,1139520,of outside the capitol on january 6  threatening those democratic lawmakers
Uzj1_kb3tck,1139520,1145120,these are areas these pictures that the  democrat that the committee has released  these are areas this person was taking
Uzj1_kb3tck,1145120,1151440,photos in that are really obscure areas  as you mentioned  security checkpoints hallways stairways
Uzj1_kb3tck,1151440,1157120,places that don't really have any  historic significance for for tourists  to take photos but this is the reasoning
Uzj1_kb3tck,1157120,1164559,congressman loudermilk is giving for why  those people were taking pictures in  these areas listen here
Uzj1_kb3tck,1164559,1170240,why do you think pictures were being  taken of a stairwell around security if  you go to that stairwell there's a
Uzj1_kb3tck,1170240,1176799,golden eagle scotch that's on the wall  that's what i was taking a picture of i  mean there these are folks who had never
Uzj1_kb3tck,1176799,1182400,been to washington dc  and they're they were here to visit  their congressman so why not just speak
Uzj1_kb3tck,1182400,1188080,to the committee and just because the  committee's never called me and asked me  anything
Uzj1_kb3tck,1188160,1193679,loudermilk saying he has not directly  heard from the committee those two now
Uzj1_kb3tck,1193679,1199200,two letters that they've sent to him but  he's saying that if the committee were  to directly reach out he really wouldn't
Uzj1_kb3tck,1199200,1206320,give an answer as to whether he would  talk with them uh but this really begs  some questions here why even was he
Uzj1_kb3tck,1206320,1212960,giving a tour of not the capital but he  says he was giving a tour of the house  buildings that day when the tours
Uzj1_kb3tck,1212960,1219520,actually of the capital were all shut  down because of covid that wasn't even  going on during that time uh and really
Uzj1_kb3tck,1219520,1226240,if if he's denying any wrongdoing why  doesn't he just sit down with the  committee in general and have this  discussion so these are several things
Uzj1_kb3tck,1226240,1231440,we're continuing to reach out to  laddermilk and continue to ask him halle  the committee wants that conversation we
Uzj1_kb3tck,1231440,1236480,know they're going to have a  conversation tomorrow with two other  witnesses right at tomorrow's hearing  which by the way we'll have special
Uzj1_kb3tck,1236480,1242880,coverage of right here on nbc news now  as we talk about as the committee talks  about this pressure campaign on then vp
Uzj1_kb3tck,1242880,1248720,mike pence greg jacob will testify  former aide to the vice president uh  former vice president along with judge
Uzj1_kb3tck,1248720,1254960,um j michael ludig who is somebody who  is a former federal judge  advising the penn circle the pence orbit
Uzj1_kb3tck,1254960,1260559,as the days leading up to january 6th  approach talk about this because greg  jacob in particular this is the name
Uzj1_kb3tck,1260559,1266960,that is probably not familiar to most of  the people who are watching if you're  not a big politics nerd like me and you  right um because he was playing more of
Uzj1_kb3tck,1266960,1272320,a behind the scenes role he has not come  out and like written a book let's say or  talked publicly about his experience at
Uzj1_kb3tck,1272320,1278559,the capitol with mike pence on january  6th so i think there's some real  interest in what he's going to tell the  committee
Uzj1_kb3tck,1278559,1285520,yeah the committee actually held a  background call for report for our  reporters actually just ending minutes  ago talking about really what we expect
Uzj1_kb3tck,1285520,1290720,to hear tomorrow they said that this  hearing is going to be be divided into  several parts and it's really going to
Uzj1_kb3tck,1290720,1296640,go into  really how this idea was born that  former vice president mike pence could
Uzj1_kb3tck,1296640,1302559,really unilaterally overturn those  election results as he was overseeing  the certification of the results
Uzj1_kb3tck,1302559,1308400,in congress in the senate that day and  they're going to go through as you  mentioned greg jacobs who was there with
Uzj1_kb3tck,1308400,1314960,mike pence with the former second lady  as they were ushered from the senate  chamber to a safe space
Uzj1_kb3tck,1314960,1321679,really minutes before the mob ended up  in the same area they said that we're  going to hear again from never before
Uzj1_kb3tck,1321679,1327520,seen video audio pre-recorded testimony  really hearing from what former campaign
Uzj1_kb3tck,1327520,1332559,manager bill stephen laid out and  described as a team normal these people
Uzj1_kb3tck,1332559,1338240,who really  under  uh held by their constitutional oath and
Uzj1_kb3tck,1338240,1343679,really told the former vice president  that this wasn't constitutional this  wasn't possible and then we're going to
Uzj1_kb3tck,1343679,1351039,hear from congresswoman liz cheney  really teased this video that she posted  on twitter last night of a pre-recorded
Uzj1_kb3tck,1351039,1356559,testimony from former white house  counsel who said that the day after  january 6 he had a call with john
Uzj1_kb3tck,1356559,1362720,eastman john eastman a familiar name  that is widely believed to be sort of  the mastermind
Uzj1_kb3tck,1362720,1370080,behind this idea that former vice  president mike pence could unilaterally  overturn the rel election rather results
Uzj1_kb3tck,1370080,1375120,telling him giving him the advice to get  a criminal defense lawyer because he  said quote he would def he would
Uzj1_kb3tck,1375120,1380400,definitely need it  so that's just a little teaser of what  we expect to hear tomorrow really
Uzj1_kb3tck,1380400,1387840,connecting the dots between what we saw  at the capitol on january 6 and this  culmination this snowball effect of when
Uzj1_kb3tck,1387840,1393360,this idea was born hallie ali rafa thank  you very much appreciate it our coverage  by the way of tomorrow's hearing starts
Uzj1_kb3tck,1393360,1399679,at 12 30 eastern right here on nbc news  now you know for a while now ukraine's  been asking the west
Uzj1_kb3tck,1399679,1405120,i don't know if you'd even say asking  they've basically been begging the west  for way more weapons
Uzj1_kb3tck,1405120,1410799,today the u.s is delivering announcing  another billion dollars in help in more  equipment basically spokesperson for
Uzj1_kb3tck,1410799,1416640,national security at the white house  john kirby today saying the u.s is  really doing everything they can
Uzj1_kb3tck,1416640,1422080,the president's on the side of the  people of ukraine  and he wants to make sure that
Uzj1_kb3tck,1422080,1428240,we're doing everything we can to help  ukraine's armed forces succeed on the  battlefield
Uzj1_kb3tck,1428240,1434159,that help is super important right now  especially in the fight for the eastern  city of sivera donetsk ukrainian forces
Uzj1_kb3tck,1434159,1440159,there are pretty much cornered in an  industrial part of the city and it comes  as hundreds of people civilians dozens
Uzj1_kb3tck,1440159,1445360,of kids right they're still stuck  sheltering at a chemical plant there ali  aruzi is here with us now and ali i want
Uzj1_kb3tck,1445360,1451120,to start with some new reporting from  the washington post and some other  outlets who spoke with the families of  two u.s veterans that they say have gone
Uzj1_kb3tck,1451120,1457440,missing overseas the mother of one of  the vets says that alex  felt very strongly her son felt very
Uzj1_kb3tck,1457440,1462559,strongly he had been trained in ways he  could help the ukrainians be strong and  push putin back that they went there to
Uzj1_kb3tck,1462559,1467600,train i believe that the state  department has acknowledged hearing  reports of these these two missing
Uzj1_kb3tck,1467600,1472760,people do we know anything else do you  know anything more ali
Uzj1_kb3tck,1472880,1478080,hey that's right and the state  department said that they are in close  contact with the ukrainian authorities
Uzj1_kb3tck,1478080,1485520,they haven't confirmed uh that these two  have been taken but if these reports are  true ali they would be the first uh two
Uzj1_kb3tck,1485520,1491600,american servicemen to be held by the  russians as prisoners of war and that  would be very significant and of course
Uzj1_kb3tck,1491600,1497919,the fear is that russians would use them  for propaganda and i can tell you hallie  that i spoke to the spokesperson to the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1497919,1504000,foreign legion here yesterday and he was  telling me that the bulk of the people  that have joined the foreign legion are
Uzj1_kb3tck,1504000,1511120,either from the united states or great  britain so there are several uh groups  of people here from america and the uk
Uzj1_kb3tck,1511120,1517200,fighting for them but this would be a  significant turn in the war if indeed it  turns out to be true and they are being
Uzj1_kb3tck,1517200,1522320,held by the russians there has been so  much focus on the donbass region in the  east and the president of ukraine
Uzj1_kb3tck,1522320,1528960,president vladimir zelinsky has said  whatever happens there is going to be  key to determining who will dominate  this war overall in the weeks to come it
Uzj1_kb3tck,1528960,1533919,feels like right now that is russia no  on the ground where you are
Uzj1_kb3tck,1534799,1540640,it is right now the momentum certainly  seems to be on russia's side they've  outnumbered and outgunned the ukrainians
Uzj1_kb3tck,1540640,1547200,and as you just said they've pushed the  the ukrainian forces in severe doneness  which is uh the capital of the luhansk
Uzj1_kb3tck,1547200,1553039,area right to the outskirts of the city  they're only in charge of the industrial  zone there and the people that are
Uzj1_kb3tck,1553039,1559279,living there that are still trapped  there are living in appalling conditions  like they were in mariopol the u.n today
Uzj1_kb3tck,1559279,1564320,said that they're running out of food  clean water uh electricity and that they
Uzj1_kb3tck,1564320,1570880,can't survive under these conditions for  much longer but that city is now  essentially cut off from the rest of
Uzj1_kb3tck,1570880,1576960,ukraine so it's a really desperate  situation and from all the counts we're  hearing the russians are shelling that
Uzj1_kb3tck,1576960,1583279,place uh from morning noon and night  it's a it's a relentless onslaught there  the ukrainian commander said that the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1583279,1588799,only time there's a lull in shelling is  when the russians are reloading  ali really quickly before i let you go i
Uzj1_kb3tck,1588799,1595520,want to sort of end this discussion  where we started the discussion at the  top of the show and that's on the  economy right because you now have some
Uzj1_kb3tck,1595520,1602000,reportedly western allies again we  haven't confirmed this asking for a  ceasefire because their economies are  dealing with inflation with high gas
Uzj1_kb3tck,1602000,1608559,prices some of the economic fallout here  is there a sense that you're getting  that after supplying you know this help  to ukraine all these weapons that some
Uzj1_kb3tck,1608559,1613760,nations might want that ceasefire to  become an option
Uzj1_kb3tck,1613760,1619279,that's a real fear here uh halle you  hear it from the ukrainians all the time  they're really worried that support from
Uzj1_kb3tck,1619279,1626240,the west is going to start dwindling and  this war drags on as interest dwindles  in it and as people are hurting at home
Uzj1_kb3tck,1626240,1631919,now they feel like they have a lot of  support from the united states and great  britain those are the two biggest allies
Uzj1_kb3tck,1631919,1637120,but they don't feel like they're getting  that support from places like france and  germany i mean you talk to most
Uzj1_kb3tck,1637120,1643120,ukrainians here and president macron is  not a popular man here in ukraine and  they they say that because they feel
Uzj1_kb3tck,1643120,1648240,like they're not getting that kind of  support from france as they are getting  from the u.s
Uzj1_kb3tck,1648240,1654960,ali aruzi live first and keeve glad to  have you there ali on a day with a bunch  of headlines as we just laid out thank  you coming up the results of donald
Uzj1_kb3tck,1654960,1660240,trump's so-called revenge campaign in  last night's primaries looking a little  bit mixed we're gonna break down the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1660240,1666320,results and look ahead at the latest  shake-up in georgia's senate race  plus what we know about the barbie movie
Uzj1_kb3tck,1666320,1672860,next and the five things  [Music]
Uzj1_kb3tck,1684159,1690399,let's get you over to the five things  our team thinks you should know about  tonight number one officials in southern  california say two police officers were
Uzj1_kb3tck,1690399,1696880,shot and killed after responding to a  report of a possible stabbing at a motel  last night the suspect was also killed
Uzj1_kb3tck,1696880,1703120,the sheriff's department is looking into  what exactly happened  number two the southern baptist  convention has voted to make a list of
Uzj1_kb3tck,1703120,1708559,pastors and church workers who have been  credibly accused of sex abuse this is  the nation's biggest protestant
Uzj1_kb3tck,1708559,1715200,denomination saying they're going to  also launch a task force to oversee more  reforms  the vote fell short for some survivors
Uzj1_kb3tck,1715200,1721039,of sexual abuse who said they had wanted  a compensation fund for victims  number three listen to what japan just
Uzj1_kb3tck,1721039,1726480,did  if you insult people online you could be  punished by up to a year in prison yeah
Uzj1_kb3tck,1726480,1732799,think about that that's after a reality  start died there's been more concern  about cyber bullying there ever since  that star died by suicide after dealing
Uzj1_kb3tck,1732799,1739279,with online abuse the new rule is set to  go into effect later this summer  number four microsoft
Uzj1_kb3tck,1739279,1744640,saying goodbye to a longtime friend foe  how do you describe internet explorer 27
Uzj1_kb3tck,1744640,1750080,year old browser right older than  probably some of you watching the show  getting retired as the company pushes
Uzj1_kb3tck,1750080,1755120,users to its edge browser instead if you  are an elder millennial like me you know
Uzj1_kb3tck,1755120,1761200,that it is the end of an era  number five have you seen the picture  that absolutely broke the internet today
Uzj1_kb3tck,1761200,1766320,this is it  feast your eyeballs man ryan gosling in  the new barbie movie we don't know
Uzj1_kb3tck,1766320,1773279,anything about the plot we don't know  anything about the character all we know  is that this is gosling's first movie  since 2018.
Uzj1_kb3tck,1773279,1778840,you can see probably why he got the part  of ken  because of his personality
Uzj1_kb3tck,1778840,1784240,right don't i don't say what goes viral  people don't blame me it's not my fault
Uzj1_kb3tck,1784240,1791039,it went viral you look to you look  inside yourselves  all right  so politics now making the natural turn
Uzj1_kb3tck,1791039,1797120,after that and a new uh an interesting  new revelation in the republican
Uzj1_kb3tck,1797120,1803520,race for senate there with hershel  walker going up against of course  democrat incumbent rafael warnock walker
Uzj1_kb3tck,1803520,1809279,acknowledging to having a second son  that he reportedly does not talk to  walker has notably been outspoken about
Uzj1_kb3tck,1809279,1814799,fatherless homes in black communities in  his campaign in a new statement to nbc  saying that walker has supported the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1814799,1820399,child and continues to do so adding to  suggest herschel is hiding the child  because he hasn't used him in his
Uzj1_kb3tck,1820399,1825760,political campaign is offensive  and absurd  this comes as former president trump is
Uzj1_kb3tck,1825760,1830960,focusing on the next targets of his  so-called primary revenge tour like  congressman peter meyer of michigan who
Uzj1_kb3tck,1830960,1836320,criticized trump at mr trump after  january 6th  and then we saw the races the results of
Uzj1_kb3tck,1836320,1841679,the races we talked about over the last  24 hours south carolina congressman tom  rice losing to a trump-backed candidate
Uzj1_kb3tck,1841679,1848080,rice voted to impeach donald trump after  the capital attack but you know who held  on to her seat congresswoman nancy mace
Uzj1_kb3tck,1848080,1853520,she beat her trump endorsed backer by  more than seven points von hilliard is  following all of this for us um vaughn
Uzj1_kb3tck,1853520,1859760,we're glad to have you with us and as we  look ahead to the next stop on donald  trump's sort of purge tour if you will i
Uzj1_kb3tck,1859760,1866000,think you look to michigan you look at  some of these other places and the  lesson seems to be if we can draw a  lesson from the results we've seen so
Uzj1_kb3tck,1866000,1871200,far that republican voters are okay with  candidates who are critical of the  former president but an impeachment
Uzj1_kb3tck,1871200,1876158,votes like like in rice's case may have  been a bridge too far
Uzj1_kb3tck,1876480,1883279,impeachment vote apparently unforgivable  but potentially even more unforgivable  for the likes of tom rice that south
Uzj1_kb3tck,1883279,1888960,carolina congressman who only earned 25  of the vote despite serving in congress
Uzj1_kb3tck,1888960,1896320,for 10 years is the fact that he was  unrelenting hallie and his criticisms up  to the point of yesterday what three
Uzj1_kb3tck,1896320,1902159,hours before polls closed when he was  talking with you and he continued to  walk that line that donald trump had
Uzj1_kb3tck,1902159,1907760,turned his back uh on the constitution  and his actions after november of 2020
Uzj1_kb3tck,1907760,1914320,and compare that though to nancy mates  she was also on trump's purge list here  but over the last year ever since she
Uzj1_kb3tck,1914320,1919440,initially really spoke out against  donald trump following the insurrection  she
Uzj1_kb3tck,1919440,1924960,really took her criticisms back and  really when she talked about donald  trump it was more so in praising the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1924960,1930480,policies of his administration and  steered away from  outward criticism and that's why i think
Uzj1_kb3tck,1930480,1936559,she's an interesting character and  potentially other republicans may try to  follow suit after her and that is why i
Uzj1_kb3tck,1936559,1943120,wanted to ask her some questions  especially what would her message be to  donald trump now that despite his wishes
Uzj1_kb3tck,1943120,1950000,she's won a shot at winning re-election  again  donald trump tried to oust you from the
Uzj1_kb3tck,1950000,1956159,republican party what is your message to  donald trump now my message is the same  to him as it is anybody else on either
Uzj1_kb3tck,1956159,1962760,side of the aisle i am more willing to  work with anyone to work with
Uzj1_kb3tck,1964159,1969519,ali you mention it there's three other  house gop members of congress who have
Uzj1_kb3tck,1969519,1975600,primaries against trump endorsed  candidates those three members they  voted for impeachment just like tom rice
Uzj1_kb3tck,1975600,1981120,but they're trying to hold on to their  seats then there's that fourth one two  months from now liz cheney she has a
Uzj1_kb3tck,1981120,1986799,competitive primary against a  trump-backed candidate named harriet  hageman that's going to be the real
Uzj1_kb3tck,1986799,1992640,challenge because there's nobody that  has been more vocal through all of this  than liz cheney let me ask about georgia
Uzj1_kb3tck,1992640,1999200,here where you also have a bit of the  trump factor in the race another key  senate race marquis senate race in that
Uzj1_kb3tck,1999200,2006559,state as we look ahead to the general  election in november this revelation of  herschel walker's um child here how um
Uzj1_kb3tck,2006559,2012960,how is that playing into the campaign  currently have we seen its impact yet or  not so much
Uzj1_kb3tck,2013519,2018960,you know i think that's going to be a  really good question here for hershel  walker he was the runaway in the gop
Uzj1_kb3tck,2018960,2024720,primary had the backing of mitch  mcconnell but also of donald trump here  but the issue is we have seen the
Uzj1_kb3tck,2024720,2031519,republican party try to shape its  message ahead of this november around  the idea of family and faith and
Uzj1_kb3tck,2031519,2037360,education in the way that the republican  party looks after the next generation
Uzj1_kb3tck,2037360,2043519,that's sort of their mantra everything  from the idea of critical race theory to  what is being taught in schools to
Uzj1_kb3tck,2043519,2048720,ultimately what they deem to be family  values and so hershel walker not only
Uzj1_kb3tck,2048720,2055839,does he have a questionable past in  terms of the education he claims to have  achieved but also past work experiences
Uzj1_kb3tck,2055839,2062158,past connections to law enforcement a  lot of his record is under question and  now this the second child that
Uzj1_kb3tck,2062158,2068720,apparently  he has uh had but he has not  have had a close relationship with that
Uzj1_kb3tck,2068720,2074480,really undercuts so much of what  republicans have been trying to message  and again remember raphael warnock that
Uzj1_kb3tck,2074480,2079679,democrat who he'll be facing the current  senator he won in 2020 by just a margin
Uzj1_kb3tck,2079679,2084720,of 51  to 49  so this is expected to be a very close
Uzj1_kb3tck,2084720,2090800,race and uh herschel walker is taking  some cuts here that may be detrimental  to his candidacy vaughn hillyard live
Uzj1_kb3tck,2090800,2096720,for us on the campaign trail mom thank  you coming up here on the show the green  light another step closer now for the
Uzj1_kb3tck,2096720,2102960,first vaccines for kids under the age of  five we've got big news on that today  how soon you might see shots and arms
Uzj1_kb3tck,2102960,2109020,coming up  [Music]
Uzj1_kb3tck,2111839,2118240,dr anthony fauci the chief medical  advisor to president biden has tested  positive for kovit we found out just in
Uzj1_kb3tck,2118240,2124079,the last couple hours his office says he  had some mild symptoms faulty remember  became the de facto face of the pandemic
Uzj1_kb3tck,2124079,2131119,response early on  he is the head of the national institute  of allergy and infectious diseases he's  81 he's fully vaxxed he's had two
Uzj1_kb3tck,2131119,2137680,booster shots  his office says he's not recently been  in close contact with president biden or  other senior government officials uh
Uzj1_kb3tck,2137680,2142720,still a  notable moment here in this pandemic  also notable what's happening this
Uzj1_kb3tck,2142720,2149440,afternoon with an fda committee voting  just today to recommend authorizing both  modern and pfizer's coveted vaccine for
Uzj1_kb3tck,2149440,2155280,the littlest kids children under the age  of five the hope that those shots  protect against the worst outcomes of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2155280,2160720,kovan kids getting really really sick or  even dying  faster's vaccine is a three-dose vaccine
Uzj1_kb3tck,2160720,2166640,for kids ages six months to four years  moderna wants the authorization for a  two-dose vaccine for kids ages six
Uzj1_kb3tck,2166640,2173119,months to five years uh the fda it seems  like the cdc will move on this authorize
Uzj1_kb3tck,2173119,2178400,the shots fast the cdc still has to  basically sign off after the fda sign  off et cetera et cetera et cetera let me
Uzj1_kb3tck,2178400,2185359,bring in dr natalie azar here who's got  more on this okay  bottom line moderna two shots fives or
Uzj1_kb3tck,2185359,2190640,three shots this is a moment that some  parents have been waiting for for a long  time explain the significance here and
Uzj1_kb3tck,2190640,2195920,your takeaways from the committee's  discussion today because this was  there's still a couple of check marks  that have to happen but this was really
Uzj1_kb3tck,2195920,2202240,the last big hurdle no  absolutely the last big hurdle uh you  know i think the highlights from today's
Uzj1_kb3tck,2202240,2208240,meeting  were  hallie that  the calculus is really not is this
Uzj1_kb3tck,2208240,2213760,vaccine  a hundred percent effective um can we  guarantee that there won't be any
Uzj1_kb3tck,2213760,2219920,potential you know side effects that  could emerge a couple of months down the  line no what they were saying is given
Uzj1_kb3tck,2219920,2226240,the balance of the evidence  do the benefits outweigh the risk and  should parents
Uzj1_kb3tck,2226240,2231839,have the choice now that if they wish to  vaccinate their kids that they can do so
Uzj1_kb3tck,2231839,2237520,with a vaccine that at least based on  the evidence so far appears to be safe
Uzj1_kb3tck,2237520,2243200,well tolerated and effective we've  talked a lot on the show though about  vaccine hesitancy for some of these
Uzj1_kb3tck,2243200,2248800,parents with kids in this age group that  um i think the number is one in five of  them say that they would go out
Uzj1_kb3tck,2248800,2255119,immediately to get the shot four and ten  would want to wait and see  how things go in the initial short term
Uzj1_kb3tck,2255119,2261040,what are you recommending to parents or  to your patients right who are coming  and talking to you and saying hey you  know the risk is i feel like the risk is
Uzj1_kb3tck,2261040,2266240,fairly small to my kids should i get  this vaccine or not  and i do understand that and heli you
Uzj1_kb3tck,2266240,2271520,know i have spent you know really the  last two years talking about this  concept of of what we do for ourselves
Uzj1_kb3tck,2271520,2277359,versus what we do with our kids  sometimes you know there's a there's a  different sort of litmus test for for
Uzj1_kb3tck,2277359,2282800,parents in order to vaccinate their  children and i do understand that  you know in this age group we've lost
Uzj1_kb3tck,2282800,2288960,about  442 children  in this age group to this disease and
Uzj1_kb3tck,2288960,2295599,not all of whom were  immunocompromised or were more  vulnerable to severe infection and those
Uzj1_kb3tck,2295599,2300960,numbers i think are really quite  striking we don't see those kinds of  numbers with flu in a really bad flu
Uzj1_kb3tck,2300960,2307760,season hallie we don't see those kinds  of numbers so  and of course we don't have to mention  the other potential complications of of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2307760,2314720,covet 19 even if you do survive the  children can be left with you know  serious health issues and by the way
Uzj1_kb3tck,2314720,2321839,it's very one of the speakers today  actually mentioned you know it's very  stressful when your child gets sick  especially a young young child who is
Uzj1_kb3tck,2321839,2327680,that at greater risk for getting rsv or  other respiratory infections and having  your child admitted to the hospital in
Uzj1_kb3tck,2327680,2332800,the icu is traumatic both for the family  and for the child of course
Uzj1_kb3tck,2332800,2338320,you know that cdc report recently found  that about three of every four kids ages  11 and under have had evidence of having
Uzj1_kb3tck,2338320,2344160,covet right if you suspect your child or  if you know your child has had covid  should should you still vaccinate them
Uzj1_kb3tck,2344160,2349760,the answer is unequivocally yes and it  doesn't mean that there isn't some  immunity and protection that is
Uzj1_kb3tck,2349760,2356560,conferred from prior infection but there  is this concept hallie of hybrid  immunity that is infection followed by
Uzj1_kb3tck,2356560,2362079,vaccination just gives you an  exponentially broader repertoire of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2362079,2367119,immune memory so that not only are you  protected obviously against re-infection
Uzj1_kb3tck,2367119,2373040,because we know especially with the  omicron sub-variants being infected with  ba1 or ba2 doesn't necessarily protect
Uzj1_kb3tck,2373040,2379440,you from ba four or five which are now  on the rise but also preventing serious  disease and hospitalization and death
Uzj1_kb3tck,2379440,2385760,down the line that vaccine-induced  immunity  really really holds up  dr natalie azar thank you for that
Uzj1_kb3tck,2385760,2392079,breakdown appreciate it on what i know  is a significant night for a lot of  parents coming up here on the show how  the future of abortion access might be

Uzj1_kb3tck,2471920,2477200,play under a neutral flag  tonight's original now with in-depth  reporting on a topic we've been keeping
Uzj1_kb3tck,2477200,2483520,an eye on and what we know will happen  sometime in the next couple of weeks the  supreme court set to release its ruling
Uzj1_kb3tck,2483520,2488560,on a case that may overturn roe versus  wade that landmark abortion rights
Uzj1_kb3tck,2488560,2494640,access supreme court ruling  we should get word from the justices by  the end of the month and until then
Uzj1_kb3tck,2494640,2499680,we're looking at new data released today  showing that portions and abortions  rather in the u.s went up in 2020
Uzj1_kb3tck,2499680,2505680,reversing a more than 30-year decline  according to the guttmacher institute  and abortion rights advocacy group even
Uzj1_kb3tck,2505680,2512640,though there was a spike in demand for  abortions the pandemic has made it more  difficult for patients to see doctors  face to face so the fda relaxed some
Uzj1_kb3tck,2512640,2518160,rules about telemedicine and abortion  pills sent by mail  now if a post-row world potentially in
Uzj1_kb3tck,2518160,2526400,sight online clinics say they're seeing  a spike in abortion pill requests which  are ordered privately and on a  smartphone nbc's issa gutierrez talked
Uzj1_kb3tck,2526400,2533200,with somebody  who had this experience here's that  story  [Music]
Uzj1_kb3tck,2533200,2539680,this is misoprostol  i took 12 of these pills total over the
Uzj1_kb3tck,2539680,2545359,course of  nine hours  emma who asked us to not show her face
Uzj1_kb3tck,2545359,2552640,and fear she'd get in legal trouble for  sharing her story lives in south texas i  was very surprised because i was taking
Uzj1_kb3tck,2552640,2559599,precautions the 29 year old was on birth  control when she found out she was  pregnant last february i immediately
Uzj1_kb3tck,2559599,2565440,started searching for  options to access an abortion in the  state of texas but just a few months
Uzj1_kb3tck,2565440,2570880,earlier in september of last year texas  six week abortion ban went into effect i
Uzj1_kb3tck,2570880,2577839,contacted my local planned parenthood  clinic they let me know that  based on my last menstruation cycle i
Uzj1_kb3tck,2577839,2585040,was already past the six week mark emma  says they referred her to a clinic eight  hours away in new mexico she made the
Uzj1_kb3tck,2585040,2591200,decision to self-manage her abortion  with medication obtained from a friend i  was watching these youtube videos from
Uzj1_kb3tck,2591200,2597760,my home that is no more than two miles  from a planned parenthood clinic where  only six months prior i would have been
Uzj1_kb3tck,2597760,2604160,able to receive care in december the  food and drug administration lifted a  major restriction on abortion pills
Uzj1_kb3tck,2604160,2610880,permanently allowing patients to receive  abortion medication by mail instead of  requiring them to receive them in person
Uzj1_kb3tck,2610880,2617440,there are a ton of virtual clinics that  have popped up in the united states ever  since the fda stopped enforcing its
Uzj1_kb3tck,2617440,2624800,in-person dispensing requirement but the  future of those clinics is in question  19 states require clinicians to be
Uzj1_kb3tck,2624800,2631359,physically present for one or more  visits effectively eliminating access by  mail then there's the supreme court
Uzj1_kb3tck,2631359,2637839,draft opinion on roe v wade leaked last  month it looks like roughly half the  country will ban abortion within a few
Uzj1_kb3tck,2637839,2643280,months of that decision we instantly had  you know like 35 times the amount of web
Uzj1_kb3tck,2643280,2650000,traffic than we did the day before robin  tucker is a clinician at aid access a  non-profit that provides access to
Uzj1_kb3tck,2650000,2655280,medical abortion by mail around the  world we got an overwhelming surge
Uzj1_kb3tck,2655280,2662480,pretty much immediately in  patients who were requesting pills in  advance of being pregnant unlike many
Uzj1_kb3tck,2662480,2668800,u.s based telehealth abortion clinics  aid access is able to provide medication  to patients in states with tighter
Uzj1_kb3tck,2668800,2676160,restrictions by having the medication  prescribed and shipped from overseas  texas has no jurisdiction over providers
Uzj1_kb3tck,2676160,2681599,in europe or over pharmacies in india it  can't really do much about it still
Uzj1_kb3tck,2681599,2688240,people like emma worry about the  additional hurdles those seeking help  could face in a post rose society i
Uzj1_kb3tck,2688240,2694240,stumbled upon many roadblocks but i was  able to navigate them  i know that there's going to be a lot of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2694240,2700640,individuals who will see it as the end  of the path and and turn around and  continue with an unwanted unplanned
Uzj1_kb3tck,2700640,2706000,undesired pregnancy  lisa is joining us now so isa what is
Uzj1_kb3tck,2706000,2712640,the landscape for states when it comes  to abortion pills if let's say the  supreme court does in fact overturn or
Uzj1_kb3tck,2712640,2718000,take steps to overturn roe v wade  sure so hallie in some states this is
Uzj1_kb3tck,2718000,2725920,already effectively banned right for  people to be receiving these pills in  the mail the bigger question is will
Uzj1_kb3tck,2725920,2731520,states actually be able to stop people  from accessing digital help for their
Uzj1_kb3tck,2731520,2737440,abortions and getting these pills in the  mail and the answer to that question is  probably not right the legal expert who
Uzj1_kb3tck,2737440,2743760,i spoke with explained to me that in the  next five to ten years we're likely to  see states experiment with a bunch of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2743760,2750240,different types of new laws to try and  crack down on this but the reality is  that it's really difficult to track mail
Uzj1_kb3tck,2750240,2756560,that's coming in and out of a state and  on top of that what robin tucker from  aid access explained to me is that right
Uzj1_kb3tck,2756560,2762640,now there's no test to trace these drugs  in a person's body so they go to a  clinic they say that they had a positive
Uzj1_kb3tck,2762640,2768640,pregnancy test and now they're  experiencing bleeding there's no way for  physicians right now to tell whether
Uzj1_kb3tck,2768640,2773839,there was a miscarriage that happened  naturally or if it was medically induced  so those are just some of the barriers
Uzj1_kb3tck,2773839,2779599,right now i quickly want to give a shout  out to chloe atkins our nbcnews.com  reporter who contributed her reporting
Uzj1_kb3tck,2779599,2786079,to this piece today hallie lisa and  chloe thank you so much appreciate you  both when we come back we're learning  more about the real world performance of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2786079,2791920,cars that have partially automated  driver assist systems what federal  regulators are saying about the safety
Uzj1_kb3tck,2791920,2798079,of these vehicles aka autopilot right  we're talking about that plus amber  heard saying today she's expecting more
Uzj1_kb3tck,2798079,2805119,lawsuits from johnny depp we've got more  from her exclusive interview with  savannah on the today show coming up
Uzj1_kb3tck,2810079,2816240,we're hearing more tonight from amber  heard in her exclusive interview with  savannah guthrie on the today show with  heard saying she's worried she could
Uzj1_kb3tck,2816240,2822640,face even more lawsuits from ex-husband  johnny depp if she keeps talking about  their relationship watch
Uzj1_kb3tck,2822640,2830000,there's a text message where johnny  promises  total global humiliation for you
Uzj1_kb3tck,2830000,2836880,do you feel like that came true  i know he promised it  i testified to this
Uzj1_kb3tck,2836880,2843359,i'm not  a good victim i get it i'm not a likable  victim i'm not a perfect victim
Uzj1_kb3tck,2843359,2849040,but  i  when i testified i asked the jury to
Uzj1_kb3tck,2849040,2854559,just see me  as human and hear  his own words
Uzj1_kb3tck,2854559,2860000,which is a promise to do this it feels  as though he has do you feel like you
Uzj1_kb3tck,2860000,2865200,could be sued again by him for  defamation i'm scared  that
Uzj1_kb3tck,2865200,2870960,no matter what i do  no matter what i say or how i say it
Uzj1_kb3tck,2870960,2877280,every step that i take  will present another opportunity  for
Uzj1_kb3tck,2877280,2883280,this sort of uh silencing  which is what i guess a defamation
Uzj1_kb3tck,2883280,2890240,lawsuit is meant to do it's meant to  to take your voice
Uzj1_kb3tck,2890240,2896800,we'll have more of savannah's exclusive  interview this friday eight o'clock  eastern on dateline right here on nbc
Uzj1_kb3tck,2896800,2901839,new data shows drivers using tesla's  autopilot were involved in 273 crashes
Uzj1_kb3tck,2901839,2907359,since last summer this new government  report shows that's a whole lot more  than we previously knew makes up nearly
Uzj1_kb3tck,2907359,2913359,70 percent  of the nearly 400 reported crashes by a  dozen automakers honda reported 90 at
Uzj1_kb3tck,2913359,2920559,the same time involving what's called  advanced driver assistance systems  subaru 10. look at the red line though
Uzj1_kb3tck,2920559,2926319,that's tesla i mean that's the  comparative data on your screen right  there it's the first since nitsa the
Uzj1_kb3tck,2926319,2932319,national highway traffic safety  administration forced companies required  the companies report on serious crashes
Uzj1_kb3tck,2932319,2937440,involving their autopilot or driver  assistance systems so it can figure out  how well those systems do and whether
Uzj1_kb3tck,2937440,2942480,they need new regulations steven romo  has been digging through this report and  joins us now so the fed said hey give us
Uzj1_kb3tck,2942480,2948240,this data so what does this report do  right it basically shows what the data  is but i don't know that it draws any
Uzj1_kb3tck,2948240,2953520,conclusions does it  yeah that's one of the most striking  things about this data and the reports
Uzj1_kb3tck,2953520,2959680,sort of go out of their way to say you  cannot draw many conclusions from it at  all there's a lot more context that's
Uzj1_kb3tck,2959680,2965920,needed from the data and from the  automakers themselves there's not  information in the report for example of
Uzj1_kb3tck,2965920,2972240,how many of each  automaker's vehicles are on the road  there are believed to be many more  teslas out on the road which of course
Uzj1_kb3tck,2972240,2978960,would make sense that they're accounting  for more accidents in this so right now  the nitsa is saying that these reports
Uzj1_kb3tck,2978960,2984559,are preliminary to help automakers and  to help regulators know where the  problems are so they can look at
Uzj1_kb3tck,2984559,2990079,solutions it is stark though when you  see these graphs it's important to know  though that there is more information
Uzj1_kb3tck,2990079,2996880,more context needed before we do draw  conclusions sally yeah i think that's  totally fair have we heard anything from  tesla about this you know they've been
Uzj1_kb3tck,2996880,3002880,the subject of some scrutiny i think is  fair to say by the federal government  yeah we have reached out to tesla for a
Uzj1_kb3tck,3002880,3009200,response about the new nitsa reports we  have not heard back from them there have  though of course been many uh recalls
Uzj1_kb3tck,3009200,3015119,that tesla has been subject to and elon  musk has not been shy about responding  on twitter the most recent one there was
Uzj1_kb3tck,3015119,3022079,a software update needed a recall for  some of the software that was causing  some teslas to sort of roll through stop
Uzj1_kb3tck,3022079,3027920,signs and elon musk took to twitter and  said that there was not a safety issue  so we have been checking to see if maybe
Uzj1_kb3tck,3027920,3033040,he won't respond to us maybe there'll be  a tweet about these new reports we  haven't seen anything about that just
Uzj1_kb3tck,3033040,3038640,yet though smash that refresh button  right on the tweets from elon musk  because here's the thing like he also
Uzj1_kb3tck,3038640,3044400,has a lot going on because he's got  tesla he's cutting about 10 of the staff  there because he says he has a bad
Uzj1_kb3tck,3044400,3050880,feeling about the economy by the way  tesla stock ended up like 5 today he's  also set tomorrow now in this bid to try
Uzj1_kb3tck,3050880,3058160,to take over twitter to talk with  twitter  employees for the first time since this  takeover offer if you will um
Uzj1_kb3tck,3058160,3064640,this is somebody who is  you know richest guy in the world  a lot on his plate uh and a lot of
Uzj1_kb3tck,3064640,3070160,scrutiny too on a lot of different  fronts steve yeah there's going to be a  lot of scrutiny on what he has to say
Uzj1_kb3tck,3070160,3076559,tomorrow to twitter employees it's an  all hands meeting and twitter spokes  twitter spokesperson has confirmed that
Uzj1_kb3tck,3076559,3083920,elon musk will be there he is expected  to speak to employees what will he say  though that is uh the subject of a lot
Uzj1_kb3tck,3083920,3089520,of debate and a lot of speculations  twitter employees want to hear from him  if he is going to buy twitter there's
Uzj1_kb3tck,3089520,3094720,been that will he won't he aspect of it  but he's going to be there and talking  to them
Uzj1_kb3tck,3094720,3100160,to see what he has to say we know he  doesn't like people working from home in  a lot of instances so all ears are open
Uzj1_kb3tck,3100160,3105680,a lot twitter employees by the way they  have not been too shy at saying that  they're apprehensive about what's to
