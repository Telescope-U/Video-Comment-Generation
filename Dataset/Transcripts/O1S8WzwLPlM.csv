O1S8WzwLPlM,2611,6591,Our topic for today is Life Cycle of a Butterfly.
O1S8WzwLPlM,22531,26791,A butterfly lays eggs on the leaves of a plant.
O1S8WzwLPlM,49791,56791,These eggs hatch and young ones called larvae or caterpillars come out of the eggs.
O1S8WzwLPlM,68291,73791,The caterpillar first feeds on the egg shell from which it is born.
O1S8WzwLPlM,95791,100791,It then starts feeding on the leaves and starts to grow.
O1S8WzwLPlM,108791,113791,The caterpillar sheds its skin several times so that it can grow.
O1S8WzwLPlM,155791,160291,"Once the caterpillar is big enough, it stops eating."
O1S8WzwLPlM,172791,177671,It then forms a protective layer around itself.
O1S8WzwLPlM,177671,179791,This stage is called chrysalis.
O1S8WzwLPlM,185791,189791,"In this stage, the caterpillar is now called pupa."
O1S8WzwLPlM,191791,195791,The pupa remains motionless in the chrysalis.
O1S8WzwLPlM,203620,207791,"Inside the chrysalis, the pupa undergoes a series of changes."
O1S8WzwLPlM,219391,226091,"After about 15 days, a beautiful adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis."
O1S8WzwLPlM,236791,241791,"When the butterfly comes out, it's wings are small and wet."
O1S8WzwLPlM,249791,256791,The butterfly pumps fluids into its wings to make them strong and to expand.
O1S8WzwLPlM,261790,267891,"After a few hours, the wings become strong enough and the butterfly is able to fly."
O1S8WzwLPlM,281451,286791,These series of changes in the life cycle of a butterfly is called metamorphosis.
O1S8WzwLPlM,291611,292591,The End.
