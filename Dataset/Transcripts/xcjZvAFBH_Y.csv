xcjZvAFBH_Y,80,1599,i tweeted this recently just thinking
xcjZvAFBH_Y,1599,5040,about how vine was the home of short
xcjZvAFBH_Y,5040,7680,form vertical videos before it died in
xcjZvAFBH_Y,7680,12000,2016. and now in 2022 tiktok has been
xcjZvAFBH_Y,12000,14240,the most downloaded app on the planet
xcjZvAFBH_Y,14240,16640,for like the last 12 straight months in
xcjZvAFBH_Y,16640,19920,a row and short form vertical videos are
xcjZvAFBH_Y,19920,22000,blowing up and i could reach no other
xcjZvAFBH_Y,22000,24240,conclusion than
xcjZvAFBH_Y,24240,27519,vine was ahead of its time
xcjZvAFBH_Y,28160,29760,you might look at the electric vehicle
xcjZvAFBH_Y,29760,31039,revolution that's happening right now
xcjZvAFBH_Y,31039,33760,around us and think wow we have a lot to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,33760,35680,thank tesla for
xcjZvAFBH_Y,35680,39440,but tesla wasn't anywhere near the first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,39440,41920,electric car that would technically be
xcjZvAFBH_Y,41920,42840,in the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,42840,45680,1890s but even in the 1990s there was an
xcjZvAFBH_Y,45680,48399,electric car from gm called the ev-1 it
xcjZvAFBH_Y,48399,50000,was this little two-door electric coupe
xcjZvAFBH_Y,50000,52800,with a 55-mile range that sold less than
xcjZvAFBH_Y,52800,55760,2000 units before being discontinued
xcjZvAFBH_Y,55760,58000,removed from the road and crushed now of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,58000,60079,course years later evs are on the rise
xcjZvAFBH_Y,60079,61760,everyone's turning their car companies
xcjZvAFBH_Y,61760,63600,entirely electric from the inside out
xcjZvAFBH_Y,63600,67600,but no one remembers the gm ev1
xcjZvAFBH_Y,67600,69840,because it was ahead of its time and so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,69840,71439,that got me thinking there have been so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,71439,73280,many products that have launched over
xcjZvAFBH_Y,73280,75680,the years that have failed but just
xcjZvAFBH_Y,75680,77360,because the world wasn't ready for them
xcjZvAFBH_Y,77360,79200,yet and i have a few favorites that have
xcjZvAFBH_Y,79200,81439,come to mind and so these are my top
xcjZvAFBH_Y,81439,84080,favorite three gadgets that were ahead
xcjZvAFBH_Y,84080,87920,of their time so number three google
xcjZvAFBH_Y,87920,88960,glass
xcjZvAFBH_Y,88960,90159,this one's a classic i think a lot of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,90159,92000,people remember google glass but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,92000,93680,probably forget some of the crazier
xcjZvAFBH_Y,93680,95439,details so first of all this was back in
xcjZvAFBH_Y,95439,98479,2013 nearly a decade ago
xcjZvAFBH_Y,98479,101119,and they revealed it in the craziest way
xcjZvAFBH_Y,101119,104079,they had skydivers literally jump out of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,104079,106880,a blimp while streaming an entire
xcjZvAFBH_Y,106880,109439,skydive live through google hangouts
xcjZvAFBH_Y,109439,110960,straight from glass where they
xcjZvAFBH_Y,110960,112960,eventually landed on top of the building
xcjZvAFBH_Y,112960,114960,google i o is happening in then they
xcjZvAFBH_Y,114960,117759,tore through the insides on bikes to get
xcjZvAFBH_Y,117759,119759,up to this stage i mean that's a pretty
xcjZvAFBH_Y,119759,122560,grand reveal for a pair of smart glasses
xcjZvAFBH_Y,122560,124799,with a head mounted projection display
xcjZvAFBH_Y,124799,126560,that would give you extra contextual
xcjZvAFBH_Y,126560,128640,information about the world around you i
xcjZvAFBH_Y,128640,130560,do remember this being the first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,130560,132800,genuinely useful looking pair of ar
xcjZvAFBH_Y,132800,134560,glasses though so you could see turn by
xcjZvAFBH_Y,134560,136640,turn navigation in front of you with
xcjZvAFBH_Y,136640,138800,google maps you could ask google
xcjZvAFBH_Y,138800,140160,assistant questions with your voice and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,140160,141440,just get it to show your results
xcjZvAFBH_Y,141440,143360,anywhere you're at or it could show you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,143360,145040,your notifications from your phone as
xcjZvAFBH_Y,145040,146879,they came in that was super nerdy to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,146879,148480,want to do all of this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,148480,150239,hands-free all the time by wearing
xcjZvAFBH_Y,150239,153360,something on your face but even at 1500
xcjZvAFBH_Y,153360,156160,there was a lot of interest from nerds
xcjZvAFBH_Y,156160,157920,like me but just general curiosity from
xcjZvAFBH_Y,157920,161120,the public and google actually made this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,161120,162800,explorer edition that was a super
xcjZvAFBH_Y,162800,164160,limited edition run that would help them
xcjZvAFBH_Y,164160,166319,test them in real life
xcjZvAFBH_Y,166319,168319,but pretty quickly there started to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,168319,170480,become problems i mean i guess the first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,170480,173200,problem was that it looked
xcjZvAFBH_Y,173200,174800,like this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,174800,175760,which
xcjZvAFBH_Y,175760,177519,you know i mean it's cool that you have
xcjZvAFBH_Y,177519,179040,a camera and you can see like a first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,179040,181200,person view of photos and videos of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,181200,183120,things and share them
xcjZvAFBH_Y,183120,185040,but this was 2013 and people were
xcjZvAFBH_Y,185040,187920,absolutely not ready for people wearing
xcjZvAFBH_Y,187920,190000,a camera and a computer
xcjZvAFBH_Y,190000,192080,on their face it didn't have any sort of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,192080,194239,visual indicator on the outside that you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,194239,196560,were recording or taking photos so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,196560,197920,people started getting kicked out of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,197920,199280,movie theaters while wearing them
xcjZvAFBH_Y,199280,200640,because security thought they might be
xcjZvAFBH_Y,200640,202640,recording the movie and someone also got
xcjZvAFBH_Y,202640,204319,pulled over in their car and ticketed
xcjZvAFBH_Y,204319,205760,because the police thought they might
xcjZvAFBH_Y,205760,207599,have been watching a movie on google
xcjZvAFBH_Y,207599,209120,glass but even if you could get past the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,209120,210879,whole camera on the face thing like this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,210879,212159,is what it would look like to talk to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,212159,215040,somebody using glass you know the the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,215040,216959,button up here the glancing up to the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,216959,219360,side the touch pad if it wasn't like
xcjZvAFBH_Y,219360,221440,obvious already it was kind of unnatural
xcjZvAFBH_Y,221440,222959,to be talking to someone while doing
xcjZvAFBH_Y,222959,224879,that eventually google killed the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,224879,227680,project for consumers glass actually
xcjZvAFBH_Y,227680,229599,does live on through an enterprise
xcjZvAFBH_Y,229599,230799,version where it doesn't have to worry
xcjZvAFBH_Y,230799,232480,about looking like an everyday pair of
xcjZvAFBH_Y,232480,234799,glasses acceptable to wear in public but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,234799,236799,you can actually buy google glass
xcjZvAFBH_Y,236799,239280,enterprise edition 2 right now for your
xcjZvAFBH_Y,239280,242080,company where you can do live video or
xcjZvAFBH_Y,242080,244000,give step-by-step instructions on how to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,244000,246159,assemble things stuff like that but the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,246159,248959,point is it got utterly rejected by
xcjZvAFBH_Y,248959,251040,regular people by the public and we
xcjZvAFBH_Y,251040,254159,haven't seen it for years but it's 2022
xcjZvAFBH_Y,254159,256239,now and it's very clear that head
xcjZvAFBH_Y,256239,259759,mounted displays vr and ar are all again
xcjZvAFBH_Y,259759,261359,right on the horizon and about to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,261359,263600,explode again snapchat has made multiple
xcjZvAFBH_Y,263600,265199,versions of their spectacles that let
xcjZvAFBH_Y,265199,266639,you share the world from your first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,266639,268720,person perspective that's a camera on
xcjZvAFBH_Y,268720,270479,your face facebook partnered with ray
xcjZvAFBH_Y,270479,272240,bans to make some sunglasses that record
xcjZvAFBH_Y,272240,274560,video and photos that's also a camera on
xcjZvAFBH_Y,274560,277360,your face and apple of course has had a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,277360,280240,rumored ar or vr headset for what feels
xcjZvAFBH_Y,280240,282240,like years now probably coming out in
xcjZvAFBH_Y,282240,284720,the next year or two and knowing apple
xcjZvAFBH_Y,284720,287199,designed to be worn and accepted by
xcjZvAFBH_Y,287199,289440,regular people and even at i o this year
xcjZvAFBH_Y,289440,291520,kind of a callback google did a one more
xcjZvAFBH_Y,291520,294800,thing and it was a pair of ar glasses
xcjZvAFBH_Y,294800,296720,but this time focusing on live
xcjZvAFBH_Y,296720,298800,translation so not quite the same thing
xcjZvAFBH_Y,298800,301360,as google glass but still it's a start
xcjZvAFBH_Y,301360,304639,google glass walked so these could run
xcjZvAFBH_Y,304639,307759,they were for sure ahead of their time
xcjZvAFBH_Y,307759,309280,alright so number two
xcjZvAFBH_Y,309280,312720,was the samsung galaxy camera
xcjZvAFBH_Y,312720,314479,so this is a bit of a lesser known
xcjZvAFBH_Y,314479,315840,gadget some of you might remember it but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,315840,317600,it was one of my favorite things ever so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,317600,319280,i want to give it its flowers so this is
xcjZvAFBH_Y,319280,320400,2012
xcjZvAFBH_Y,320400,324160,this is the same year as the galaxy s3
xcjZvAFBH_Y,324160,327199,but this is basically a whole mirrorless
xcjZvAFBH_Y,327199,330560,camera with a galaxy s3 on the back so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,330560,333680,this is a 16 megapixel camera with a 21x
xcjZvAFBH_Y,333680,335840,optical zoom lens on the back all the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,335840,338400,processing power of a galaxy s3 with a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,338400,341520,quad-core chip on-board storage one gig
xcjZvAFBH_Y,341520,343280,of ram and it was running the newest
xcjZvAFBH_Y,343280,345360,version of android which at the time was
xcjZvAFBH_Y,345360,347520,android 4.1 basically the only thing it
xcjZvAFBH_Y,347520,349759,was lacking was an actual cellular radio
xcjZvAFBH_Y,349759,351520,to be able to make phone calls if you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,351520,352560,ask me
xcjZvAFBH_Y,352560,355759,great product idea great idea like
xcjZvAFBH_Y,355759,358160,obviously most cameras have pretty bad
xcjZvAFBH_Y,358160,360240,uis as far as navigating through them
xcjZvAFBH_Y,360240,361759,but even if they are pretty good they
xcjZvAFBH_Y,361759,363520,don't have an internet connection and a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,363520,365680,phone on the back and so how often are
xcjZvAFBH_Y,365680,367759,you just trying to take a picture
xcjZvAFBH_Y,367759,369360,and then do some quick edits in
xcjZvAFBH_Y,369360,371520,lightroom and then put it on instagram
xcjZvAFBH_Y,371520,373199,like just that quick workflow right
xcjZvAFBH_Y,373199,375360,there all the time that's exactly what
xcjZvAFBH_Y,375360,378080,this was built to do it had a smartphone
xcjZvAFBH_Y,378080,380319,display it had great performance it had
xcjZvAFBH_Y,380319,382800,the ui for it it was a dream so why did
xcjZvAFBH_Y,382800,383919,this fail
xcjZvAFBH_Y,383919,386560,well you could blame it on social media
xcjZvAFBH_Y,386560,388720,being a little bit older you could blame
xcjZvAFBH_Y,388720,391600,it on maybe a camera market being too
xcjZvAFBH_Y,391600,393120,small at that time people didn't want a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,393120,394560,dedicated camera but at the end of the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,394560,396400,day the real reason was
xcjZvAFBH_Y,396400,398240,turned out the camera wasn't that good
xcjZvAFBH_Y,398240,400720,the actual quality of the photos
xcjZvAFBH_Y,400720,403039,weren't that much better or easier to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,403039,405600,take than a galaxy s3 in the first place
xcjZvAFBH_Y,405600,406880,and so that's the reason the reviews
xcjZvAFBH_Y,406880,408639,were terrible and nobody actually wanted
xcjZvAFBH_Y,408639,410319,to buy the thing but in the background
xcjZvAFBH_Y,410319,413599,it was very clear that a real camera
xcjZvAFBH_Y,413599,416000,with a full android experience or a full
xcjZvAFBH_Y,416000,418639,ui on the back made a lot of sense like
xcjZvAFBH_Y,418639,421039,i said most camera uis currently pretty
xcjZvAFBH_Y,421039,423039,bad and even if they aren't they sure as
xcjZvAFBH_Y,423039,424960,hell can't edit a photo and then post it
xcjZvAFBH_Y,424960,428319,on twitter or instagram fun fact android
xcjZvAFBH_Y,428319,430400,was actually supposed to be
xcjZvAFBH_Y,430400,433199,a digital camera os before it got bought
xcjZvAFBH_Y,433199,434880,up by google and turned into a phone os
xcjZvAFBH_Y,434880,436800,so really makes you think but i think
xcjZvAFBH_Y,436800,438160,what it comes down to is basically
xcjZvAFBH_Y,438160,441039,there's a friction to get something from
xcjZvAFBH_Y,441039,444160,a camera to instagram there is taking
xcjZvAFBH_Y,444160,445840,the photo and then wirelessly
xcjZvAFBH_Y,445840,447520,transferring it to your phone maybe
xcjZvAFBH_Y,447520,449599,which is either going to compress it or
xcjZvAFBH_Y,449599,451680,it's going to take a long time and so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,451680,452720,most people
xcjZvAFBH_Y,452720,455199,most people would just take a photo with
xcjZvAFBH_Y,455199,457120,their smartphone it's easy it's good
xcjZvAFBH_Y,457120,459680,enough but for photographers for the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,459680,461680,creator class or people enthusiasts like
xcjZvAFBH_Y,461680,464240,myself that friction between getting a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,464240,466479,good shot and putting it online
xcjZvAFBH_Y,466479,468160,is the problem now there are other
xcjZvAFBH_Y,468160,469919,cracks at solving this there were two
xcjZvAFBH_Y,469919,471759,generations of the galaxy camera before
xcjZvAFBH_Y,471759,474160,it was cancelled last year zeiss made a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,474160,476560,camera called the zeiss zx1 it's a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,476560,478479,full-frame camera with a fixed 35
xcjZvAFBH_Y,478479,481199,millimeter f2 lens that ran android and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,481199,482800,it also had lightroom mobile and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,482800,484319,instagram pre-installed which let you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,484319,485440,edit right there on the screen and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,485440,486879,immediately post
xcjZvAFBH_Y,486879,489360,but it was also six thousand dollars
xcjZvAFBH_Y,489360,491360,which is entirely out of reach for most
xcjZvAFBH_Y,491360,493680,people and also you couldn't install any
xcjZvAFBH_Y,493680,495440,other app besides lightroom and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,495440,496879,instagram and then there have been
xcjZvAFBH_Y,496879,498319,plenty of attempts from companies to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,498319,501360,make phones that have all the features
xcjZvAFBH_Y,501360,504720,of a full-time camera so panasonic cm1
xcjZvAFBH_Y,504720,506800,comes to mind this is from 2014 and this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,506800,509360,had a one inch 20 megapixel sensor and a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,509360,512080,28mm f 2.8 like a branded lens
xcjZvAFBH_Y,512080,513518,definitely looked like a full-blown
xcjZvAFBH_Y,513518,516159,camera but the rest of the phone wasn't
xcjZvAFBH_Y,516159,518240,good enough to justify people buying
xcjZvAFBH_Y,518240,521039,this one we even had sony try
xcjZvAFBH_Y,521039,522880,add-on lenses for your phone so here's
xcjZvAFBH_Y,522880,526160,another name for you sony qx10 i
xcjZvAFBH_Y,526160,527440,actually owned one of these i never
xcjZvAFBH_Y,527440,529839,reviewed it but it was a separate camera
xcjZvAFBH_Y,529839,530880,and lens
xcjZvAFBH_Y,530880,532480,that connects to your phone via
xcjZvAFBH_Y,532480,534959,bluetooth and pairs via nfc
xcjZvAFBH_Y,534959,537200,and just latches to the back of your
xcjZvAFBH_Y,537200,539920,phone to give you a better camera but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,539920,542640,even that was 250 dollars and didn't
xcjZvAFBH_Y,542640,544640,work perfectly every time you know how
xcjZvAFBH_Y,544640,546480,bluetooth is there's still so much
xcjZvAFBH_Y,546480,548480,friction and again at the end of the day
xcjZvAFBH_Y,548480,550399,most people totally fine with just the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,550399,552240,smartphone camera for most stuff they're
xcjZvAFBH_Y,552240,554080,putting on instagram i just did a video
xcjZvAFBH_Y,554080,556720,on the sony xperia 1 mark iv if you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,556720,557839,haven't checked that out already that
xcjZvAFBH_Y,557839,560240,one has real optical zoom so it's a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,560240,562320,better physical camera but again for
xcjZvAFBH_Y,562320,564880,photographers creators enthusiasts
xcjZvAFBH_Y,564880,566640,people like myself i maintain that we
xcjZvAFBH_Y,566640,567600,are ready
xcjZvAFBH_Y,567600,568800,right now
xcjZvAFBH_Y,568800,570160,for a good
xcjZvAFBH_Y,570160,571680,internet connected camera like
xcjZvAFBH_Y,571680,574000,brainstorming out loud imagine an iphone
xcjZvAFBH_Y,574000,575279,ui
xcjZvAFBH_Y,575279,578560,on a real full-frame mirrorless camera
xcjZvAFBH_Y,578560,581680,so a big sensor big lens but the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,581680,583519,processing power and computational
xcjZvAFBH_Y,583519,586480,photography with an m1 chip give this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,586480,589680,thing on board storage give it usb type
xcjZvAFBH_Y,589680,590399,c
xcjZvAFBH_Y,590399,592720,please and then you can throw pro in the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,592720,594000,name and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,594000,595440,that would be great yeah i would want
xcjZvAFBH_Y,595440,597360,one but until then
xcjZvAFBH_Y,597360,600959,yeah galaxy camera was ahead of its time
xcjZvAFBH_Y,600959,603440,so then number one last but not least
xcjZvAFBH_Y,603440,606560,is the motorola atrix does anybody
xcjZvAFBH_Y,606560,608880,remember the motorola atrix this was a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,608880,611040,smartphone it was a first phone with a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,611040,613920,dual core tegra 2 processor and it was
xcjZvAFBH_Y,613920,615120,the first android phone with a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,615120,617120,fingerprint sensor powerful stuff but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,617120,619200,most importantly it could connect to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,619200,622160,something called the motorola lap dock
xcjZvAFBH_Y,622160,625120,to give you a full laptop experience
xcjZvAFBH_Y,625120,627680,powered completely off of your phone
xcjZvAFBH_Y,627680,629519,it's like whoa wait a second what is a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,629519,632160,computer right i think we all basically
xcjZvAFBH_Y,632160,634480,like the general idea the concept that
xcjZvAFBH_Y,634480,637279,you only buy one computer and then you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,637279,639600,plug this one smallest computer into
xcjZvAFBH_Y,639600,642000,bigger and bigger shells to become a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,642000,643920,bigger and bigger form factor and a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,643920,645600,bigger and bigger computer because it's
xcjZvAFBH_Y,645600,648720,so powerful at its core right that idea
xcjZvAFBH_Y,648720,651600,is dope but there's two pretty big
xcjZvAFBH_Y,651600,654160,hurdles towards actually achieving that
xcjZvAFBH_Y,654160,655279,power
xcjZvAFBH_Y,655279,657360,and software so motorola with the atrix
xcjZvAFBH_Y,657360,659519,they attack the software problem head-on
xcjZvAFBH_Y,659519,661040,right so their version of android was
xcjZvAFBH_Y,661040,662800,called moto blur and when you plugged it
xcjZvAFBH_Y,662800,665200,into the lap dock immediately that would
xcjZvAFBH_Y,665200,667279,turn into an experience pretty similar
xcjZvAFBH_Y,667279,669440,to what we have with samsung dex now
xcjZvAFBH_Y,669440,672959,full-on laptop looking thing a dock apps
xcjZvAFBH_Y,672959,675040,windows the whole deal but the tougher
xcjZvAFBH_Y,675040,677920,challenge was definitely power right so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,677920,680720,this phone came out in 2011. the first
xcjZvAFBH_Y,680720,682640,dual core chip in any smartphone was a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,682640,684640,pretty big deal at the time but let's be
xcjZvAFBH_Y,684640,687120,real it's not powerful enough to be a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,687120,690160,full-fledged laptop photo editing video
xcjZvAFBH_Y,690160,692079,editing all that stuff much less even a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,692079,693760,chromebook at that time and so this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,693760,695920,actually kind of creates a third problem
xcjZvAFBH_Y,695920,698079,on its own basically which is if you buy
xcjZvAFBH_Y,698079,698959,into
xcjZvAFBH_Y,698959,702800,this ecosystem this version of that idea
xcjZvAFBH_Y,702800,704800,you're kind of stuck this atrix costs
xcjZvAFBH_Y,704800,706959,200 bucks on a two-year contract but
xcjZvAFBH_Y,706959,711360,then the lap dock cost 500 extra dollars
xcjZvAFBH_Y,711360,713600,for basically a shell with a keyboard
xcjZvAFBH_Y,713600,715279,and a screen and a battery if you
xcjZvAFBH_Y,715279,718000,upgraded your phone you could no longer
xcjZvAFBH_Y,718000,720560,use your laptop so the atrix didn't hit
xcjZvAFBH_Y,720560,723519,right but now in 2022 the computing
xcjZvAFBH_Y,723519,726880,power in smartphones has come a long way
xcjZvAFBH_Y,726880,728480,people you know in benchmarks and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,728480,730959,reviews might think we're nitpicking and
xcjZvAFBH_Y,730959,732079,seeing if there's a difference between
xcjZvAFBH_Y,732079,733920,the snapdragon 8gen 1 and the triple
xcjZvAFBH_Y,733920,735600,eight but really the fact is all the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,735600,737760,extra headroom we're getting has way
xcjZvAFBH_Y,737760,740079,more functionality besides just texting
xcjZvAFBH_Y,740079,741440,and using the phone like normal it can
xcjZvAFBH_Y,741440,743600,become a computer we also already know
xcjZvAFBH_Y,743600,745200,the m1 chips powering the latest
xcjZvAFBH_Y,745200,747440,macbooks right now are based on a14
xcjZvAFBH_Y,747440,750000,bionic from the iphone just scaled up so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,750000,752320,you can imagine plugging the smartphone
xcjZvAFBH_Y,752320,754240,into a larger form factor even if it's
xcjZvAFBH_Y,754240,756720,not a video editing machine still is a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,756720,759920,very capable laptop web browsing machine
xcjZvAFBH_Y,759920,761440,honestly even photo editing would
xcjZvAFBH_Y,761440,763040,probably go very smoothly just like the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,763040,764560,way we see it on ipads plus it's
xcjZvAFBH_Y,764560,766560,obviously great having all your messages
xcjZvAFBH_Y,766560,768240,but also all your apps and all your
xcjZvAFBH_Y,768240,769839,files just with you all the time no
xcjZvAFBH_Y,769839,771920,matter what machine you're using so this
xcjZvAFBH_Y,771920,774000,idea definitely has legs for the near
xcjZvAFBH_Y,774000,776320,future honestly the biggest problem that
xcjZvAFBH_Y,776320,779360,i see or the biggest obstacle in the way
xcjZvAFBH_Y,779360,781839,of it is still the ecosystem problem
xcjZvAFBH_Y,781839,783839,specifically because
xcjZvAFBH_Y,783839,786720,a company like apple would much rather
xcjZvAFBH_Y,786720,790240,have you buy an iphone and an ipad and a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,790240,792639,macbook than just to sell you one
xcjZvAFBH_Y,792639,794800,computer that can be everything so there
xcjZvAFBH_Y,794800,796639,are some third-party attempts at a
xcjZvAFBH_Y,796639,798160,modern version of this there's a company
xcjZvAFBH_Y,798160,800399,called next that makes the next dock
xcjZvAFBH_Y,800399,802079,this is basically the same thing as the
xcjZvAFBH_Y,802079,804639,atrix but over a usbc connection for
xcjZvAFBH_Y,804639,806079,samsung phones
xcjZvAFBH_Y,806079,808480,boom portable dex laptop but again
xcjZvAFBH_Y,808480,810560,that's only for samsung phones so really
xcjZvAFBH_Y,810560,812560,the fact that the whole ecosystem has to
xcjZvAFBH_Y,812560,814880,play for this idea to work makes it much
xcjZvAFBH_Y,814880,818160,harder than just one single gadget so
xcjZvAFBH_Y,818160,820480,the atrix was for sure ahead of its time
xcjZvAFBH_Y,820480,822000,and probably will be for a little while
xcjZvAFBH_Y,822000,824240,longer but i like the possibilities here
xcjZvAFBH_Y,824240,826000,i like where we're going with that one
xcjZvAFBH_Y,826000,827360,either way
xcjZvAFBH_Y,827360,828720,yeah vine
xcjZvAFBH_Y,828720,830320,was definitely ahead of its time fine
xcjZvAFBH_Y,830320,833760,walk so tick tock could run
xcjZvAFBH_Y,833760,835279,all right thanks for watching
xcjZvAFBH_Y,835279,836800,catch you guys in the next one
xcjZvAFBH_Y,836800,839800,peace
