JwHCOI8V4LQ,6799,8880,hello everyone and thank you tedx micah
JwHCOI8V4LQ,8880,10240,for having me here the subject of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,10240,12240,today's talk is mind the gap and the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,12240,13759,first thought that comes to mind is the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,13759,15759,metro train and it's constant advice to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,15759,17520,mind the gap that we don't really dwell
JwHCOI8V4LQ,17520,19680,on once we're off the train but mind the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,19680,22400,gap can and does have a more profound
JwHCOI8V4LQ,22400,24480,meaning today i'm telling you about the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,24480,27119,gaps that i grapple with and how i try
JwHCOI8V4LQ,27119,29199,to fill them in my own way this is my
JwHCOI8V4LQ,29199,31519,story and before i begin it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,31519,33360,i have a question for you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,33360,35360,what is your story
JwHCOI8V4LQ,35360,37040,when you grow up and talk to your
JwHCOI8V4LQ,37040,38559,grandchildren what's the story that you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,38559,40640,want to tell will your story be more
JwHCOI8V4LQ,40640,42480,exciting than your cv
JwHCOI8V4LQ,42480,44320,or will you say you woke up went to work
JwHCOI8V4LQ,44320,46160,completed projects met deadlines and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,46160,48480,targets got promoted every other year
JwHCOI8V4LQ,48480,49760,basically went through the motions of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,49760,51520,life did not drop too many balls but did
JwHCOI8V4LQ,51520,54160,not disrupt very much either
JwHCOI8V4LQ,54160,56000,think of the story you want to tell a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,56000,57840,few decades from now and then start
JwHCOI8V4LQ,57840,60160,writing it today because our world today
JwHCOI8V4LQ,60160,62640,is essentially a grand storytelling
JwHCOI8V4LQ,62640,64559,competition we're all striving to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,64559,67200,present our own national cultural and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,67200,69600,personal stories in the most persuasive
JwHCOI8V4LQ,69600,70799,manner
JwHCOI8V4LQ,70799,72720,i remember reading somewhere that in the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,72720,75119,olden times we said if you want to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,75119,77200,poison a people you must poison their
JwHCOI8V4LQ,77200,78320,wells
JwHCOI8V4LQ,78320,80560,but in this day and age as novelist ben
JwHCOI8V4LQ,80560,82240,okra said if you want a poisonous people
JwHCOI8V4LQ,82240,83840,poison their stories
JwHCOI8V4LQ,83840,86159,because stories sway people they change
JwHCOI8V4LQ,86159,88400,the course of policies politics and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,88400,90000,indeed the world
JwHCOI8V4LQ,90000,91759,i'll give you an example during the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,91759,93920,second world war america had a list of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,93920,96000,japanese cities it wanted to bomb with
JwHCOI8V4LQ,96000,98400,the atom bomb the city of kyoto was on
JwHCOI8V4LQ,98400,101360,that list but it was removed
JwHCOI8V4LQ,101360,103119,by the secretary of war american
JwHCOI8V4LQ,103119,104399,secretary of war
JwHCOI8V4LQ,104399,105840,henry stimson
JwHCOI8V4LQ,105840,108240,instead they put nagasaki why do you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,108240,110799,think he removed kyoto because he'd gone
JwHCOI8V4LQ,110799,112479,there for his honeymoon he'd seen
JwHCOI8V4LQ,112479,114640,kyoto's beauty and culture and he did
JwHCOI8V4LQ,114640,116880,not want to see it destroyed
JwHCOI8V4LQ,116880,119280,you could say kyoto's story saved it and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,119280,120960,that's why it's very important to be in
JwHCOI8V4LQ,120960,123280,control of your story to actively shape
JwHCOI8V4LQ,123280,124320,it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,124320,125920,and this is the first gap that i
JwHCOI8V4LQ,125920,127759,encountered in my career as a journalist
JwHCOI8V4LQ,127759,129679,we are a country of 1.4 billion people
JwHCOI8V4LQ,129679,131920,we have hundreds of channels a very
JwHCOI8V4LQ,131920,134239,aware and politically engaged audience
JwHCOI8V4LQ,134239,136239,but we did not have a single news
JwHCOI8V4LQ,136239,138879,channel or newspaper that told our story
JwHCOI8V4LQ,138879,140879,to the world
JwHCOI8V4LQ,140879,142239,the new york times writes something
JwHCOI8V4LQ,142239,143840,about india and it immediately becomes a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,143840,145920,twitter trend you may trash it but
JwHCOI8V4LQ,145920,147920,you're still consuming it and reacting
JwHCOI8V4LQ,147920,150239,to it the economist weighs in on an
JwHCOI8V4LQ,150239,151920,indian election and it becomes part of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,151920,153519,the political debate
JwHCOI8V4LQ,153519,155440,we are letting the foreign press shape
JwHCOI8V4LQ,155440,157120,our self-image
JwHCOI8V4LQ,157120,158879,which indian newspaper triggers a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,158879,160879,similar response in the west
JwHCOI8V4LQ,160879,162560,if there is disturbance in kashmir the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,162560,165040,world learns about it from the bbc or al
JwHCOI8V4LQ,165040,166400,jazeera
JwHCOI8V4LQ,166400,168160,they use their own lens their own
JwHCOI8V4LQ,168160,169760,editorial biases and for the moment
JwHCOI8V4LQ,169760,171440,that's besides the point the argument
JwHCOI8V4LQ,171440,173840,i'm making is very simple why can't
JwHCOI8V4LQ,173840,175440,india the land of epics like the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,175440,177440,mahabharata and ramayan tell its own
JwHCOI8V4LQ,177440,179599,story in its own words
JwHCOI8V4LQ,179599,181680,this gap was filled by we on india's
JwHCOI8V4LQ,181680,183120,first international news channel of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,183120,184480,which i'm a part
JwHCOI8V4LQ,184480,187280,gap number two you have a story but why
JwHCOI8V4LQ,187280,188879,should anyone listen to it there are
JwHCOI8V4LQ,188879,190480,multiple channels with heavyweight
JwHCOI8V4LQ,190480,192319,anchors all discussing the same story
JwHCOI8V4LQ,192319,194000,with the same guests the same graphics
JwHCOI8V4LQ,194000,195760,the same visuals and the same decibel
JwHCOI8V4LQ,195760,196959,levels
JwHCOI8V4LQ,196959,199120,we like that song i'm just a copy of a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,199120,201920,copy of a copy we all kept looking at
JwHCOI8V4LQ,201920,204560,each other and perhaps forgot the viewer
JwHCOI8V4LQ,204560,206480,we wanted to do what someone else was
JwHCOI8V4LQ,206480,209120,doing bigger bolder brighter but not
JwHCOI8V4LQ,209120,211440,necessarily better if you have 10
JwHCOI8V4LQ,211440,213840,windows i'll have 12. but we forgot to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,213840,216080,ask what the viewer wants
JwHCOI8V4LQ,216080,218720,do you want to see so many talking heads
JwHCOI8V4LQ,218720,220560,do you want an endless and frankly
JwHCOI8V4LQ,220560,223360,useless shouting match every day
JwHCOI8V4LQ,223360,225280,and if you want to see a good stunt will
JwHCOI8V4LQ,225280,228640,you watch avengers or anchors
JwHCOI8V4LQ,228640,230159,in this clutter how do you become
JwHCOI8V4LQ,230159,232400,different what sets you apart is the way
JwHCOI8V4LQ,232400,234159,you tell the story and that brings me to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,234159,235840,the concept of the katha and the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,235840,237200,kathakar
JwHCOI8V4LQ,237200,238720,if you have a child or a niece or a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,238720,241360,nephew you would have noticed something
JwHCOI8V4LQ,241360,243200,they all ask for the same story to be
JwHCOI8V4LQ,243200,245599,told over and over again we did the same
JwHCOI8V4LQ,245599,247840,with our grandparents we know the story
JwHCOI8V4LQ,247840,249519,from beginning to end but we want to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,249519,251200,hear it again
JwHCOI8V4LQ,251200,253599,why do we like the same story retold
JwHCOI8V4LQ,253599,255760,because what is pulling us is not the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,255760,258000,katha or the story but the kathakar or
JwHCOI8V4LQ,258000,260400,the storyteller the manner in which that
JwHCOI8V4LQ,260400,262560,story is told that's what holds the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,262560,263919,magic
JwHCOI8V4LQ,263919,266720,how do we create this magic in news
JwHCOI8V4LQ,266720,267840,well i was introduced to the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,267840,271040,life-changing concept called orbit shift
JwHCOI8V4LQ,271040,273440,it's a very simple concept you all know
JwHCOI8V4LQ,273440,275440,what a gravitational pull is it's in the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,275440,278160,simplest of terms it keeps you grounded
JwHCOI8V4LQ,278160,280479,but it also prevents you from flying
JwHCOI8V4LQ,280479,282880,as professionals and individuals we are
JwHCOI8V4LQ,282880,284960,saddled with many levels of gravity
JwHCOI8V4LQ,284960,286800,number one is personal gravity this is
JwHCOI8V4LQ,286800,288960,what i can do this is what i cannot do
JwHCOI8V4LQ,288960,290639,there is self-doubt
JwHCOI8V4LQ,290639,292240,and there are limitations that your mind
JwHCOI8V4LQ,292240,293440,sets for you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,293440,295199,number two is company gravity this
JwHCOI8V4LQ,295199,296800,cannot be done in our organization
JwHCOI8V4LQ,296800,297759,because you will not get
JwHCOI8V4LQ,297759,301520,cross-functional support or because
JwHCOI8V4LQ,301520,303919,we've all heard this and accepted it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,303919,306479,number three is industry gravity how can
JwHCOI8V4LQ,306479,308320,you do a 9pm show without guests it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,308320,309840,doesn't happen anywhere how can you not
JwHCOI8V4LQ,309840,311600,take a break in the middle of the show
JwHCOI8V4LQ,311600,314240,this is the industry practice and soon
JwHCOI8V4LQ,314240,316400,it becomes industry gravity and we do
JwHCOI8V4LQ,316400,319120,not challenge it number four is the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,319120,321520,social or cultural gravity prejudice
JwHCOI8V4LQ,321520,324160,preconceptions in india we flaunt the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,324160,325840,jugar
JwHCOI8V4LQ,325840,327759,we do not want a long-term plan because
JwHCOI8V4LQ,327759,329520,we believe in figuring something out at
JwHCOI8V4LQ,329520,331759,the last moment with jugaad
JwHCOI8V4LQ,331759,333520,now think of the number of times when
JwHCOI8V4LQ,333520,335199,you've had to struggle with this
JwHCOI8V4LQ,335199,337600,cumulative gravity it is the biggest
JwHCOI8V4LQ,337600,339280,hurdle in the path of innovation it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,339280,340639,kills ideas
JwHCOI8V4LQ,340639,342320,and you rationalize all of it in the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,342320,345039,name of practicality but sometimes
JwHCOI8V4LQ,345039,347360,you have to be impractical
JwHCOI8V4LQ,347360,349120,you have to throw yourself at the deep
JwHCOI8V4LQ,349120,351440,end and burn the bridge to safety to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,351440,353199,come up with something that is really
JwHCOI8V4LQ,353199,355440,transformative and that is what is
JwHCOI8V4LQ,355440,357840,called an orbit shift and that's what we
JwHCOI8V4LQ,357840,360160,did with gravitas or we hope we did we
JwHCOI8V4LQ,360160,362560,created a prime time news and view show
JwHCOI8V4LQ,362560,365039,minus multiple guests we went back to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,365039,366720,the drawing board to focus on tight
JwHCOI8V4LQ,366720,369360,scripts on relevant subjects research
JwHCOI8V4LQ,369360,371840,analysis fact checks basic things really
JwHCOI8V4LQ,371840,374720,which should ideally be sop for all news
JwHCOI8V4LQ,374720,377199,but they were not
JwHCOI8V4LQ,377199,378560,gap number three or should i say
JwHCOI8V4LQ,378560,379759,challenge
JwHCOI8V4LQ,379759,382479,who watches tv news anymore there is an
JwHCOI8V4LQ,382479,384400,explosion of content around you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,384400,386240,television is already the second screen
JwHCOI8V4LQ,386240,389199,the mobile phone has taken the top spot
JwHCOI8V4LQ,389199,391280,so my new story is competing with the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,391280,394080,whatsapp forward and instagram reel a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,394080,396400,youtube spoof and what have you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,396400,398560,one editor famously said my competition
JwHCOI8V4LQ,398560,400479,is not other news shows my competition
JwHCOI8V4LQ,400479,402560,at nine o'clock is big boss or kapil
JwHCOI8V4LQ,402560,403520,sharma
JwHCOI8V4LQ,403520,405600,another one asked for fizz
JwHCOI8V4LQ,405600,407680,and said that do not do water journalism
JwHCOI8V4LQ,407680,409520,colorless flavorless odourless this is
JwHCOI8V4LQ,409520,412240,the age of coke find your flavor
JwHCOI8V4LQ,412240,414479,well what should that flavor be
JwHCOI8V4LQ,414479,417039,inform without making a fuss
JwHCOI8V4LQ,417039,419280,give your viewer value for time that's
JwHCOI8V4LQ,419280,421199,the flavor we decided on
JwHCOI8V4LQ,421199,423120,use the old playbook of aristotle to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,423120,424880,make your story compelling
JwHCOI8V4LQ,424880,427759,he gave us five elements of a good story
JwHCOI8V4LQ,427759,429680,some 2000 years ago
JwHCOI8V4LQ,429680,432639,and these are the five elements ethos
JwHCOI8V4LQ,432639,434639,authority and character which comes with
JwHCOI8V4LQ,434639,436400,credibility and commitment to the issues
JwHCOI8V4LQ,436400,438080,that you raise in your broadcast do
JwHCOI8V4LQ,438080,440639,people trust you do they see you as an
JwHCOI8V4LQ,440639,442880,authority on a subject if they do they
JwHCOI8V4LQ,442880,444240,will listen to you
JwHCOI8V4LQ,444240,446479,number two logos that is reason which
JwHCOI8V4LQ,446479,448479,involves making a logical appeal using
JwHCOI8V4LQ,448479,450240,data and facts to make a rational
JwHCOI8V4LQ,450240,452240,argument because you cannot make an
JwHCOI8V4LQ,452240,455039,assertion with no basis in fact or logic
JwHCOI8V4LQ,455039,457440,number three is pathos emotion and this
JwHCOI8V4LQ,457440,460080,is different from drama it's a genuine
JwHCOI8V4LQ,460080,462240,connect with the audience through honest
JwHCOI8V4LQ,462240,464879,and effective communication
JwHCOI8V4LQ,464879,466720,number four is metaphor
JwHCOI8V4LQ,466720,468560,which helps the viewer process complex
JwHCOI8V4LQ,468560,469440,issues
JwHCOI8V4LQ,469440,471759,when you give them relatable parallels
JwHCOI8V4LQ,471759,473919,it makes news more memorable and number
JwHCOI8V4LQ,473919,476240,five is brevity using short sentences
JwHCOI8V4LQ,476240,479440,punchy lines informative tag outs
JwHCOI8V4LQ,479440,482000,and finally the gap that is common to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,482000,484319,all human stories the gap that i
JwHCOI8V4LQ,484319,486800,continue to try to fill the question of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,486800,487840,purpose
JwHCOI8V4LQ,487840,490879,what is the purpose of what you're doing
JwHCOI8V4LQ,490879,492879,what do you really want to do and to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,492879,494400,what end
JwHCOI8V4LQ,494400,495680,it's like that dreaded interview
JwHCOI8V4LQ,495680,497199,question where do you see yourself five
JwHCOI8V4LQ,497199,498479,years from now
JwHCOI8V4LQ,498479,500160,where do you see yourself at the end of
JwHCOI8V4LQ,500160,502400,this journey you've embarked on honestly
JwHCOI8V4LQ,502400,503680,i've not been able to answer this
JwHCOI8V4LQ,503680,506240,question so i gave myself another one
JwHCOI8V4LQ,506240,508240,which is the one story that changed your
JwHCOI8V4LQ,508240,510000,life of if or if that sounds too
JwHCOI8V4LQ,510000,512240,dramatic the one story that profoundly
JwHCOI8V4LQ,512240,514560,impacted you or just stayed with you for
JwHCOI8V4LQ,514560,516479,me that story was the story of the ugly
JwHCOI8V4LQ,516479,518800,duckling it's a nursery tale you may
JwHCOI8V4LQ,518800,520880,remember it a duck lays some eggs they
JwHCOI8V4LQ,520880,523919,hatch all ducklings look similar
JwHCOI8V4LQ,523919,525200,except one
JwHCOI8V4LQ,525200,527760,he's bigger awkward doesn't have webbed
JwHCOI8V4LQ,527760,531360,feet he feels sad about not fitting in
JwHCOI8V4LQ,531360,533120,until he sees a flock of swans and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,533120,535519,realizes he was never even a duck in the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,535519,538000,first place he was a swan bracketed with
JwHCOI8V4LQ,538000,539920,ducks by mistake he realizes he's
JwHCOI8V4LQ,539920,542399,beautiful and not ugly and he flies away
JwHCOI8V4LQ,542399,544399,and i find the story very powerful
JwHCOI8V4LQ,544399,546640,because it is simple and relatable it
JwHCOI8V4LQ,546640,549360,talks to me i think at some point in our
JwHCOI8V4LQ,549360,551519,lives we've all been the ugly duckling
JwHCOI8V4LQ,551519,553600,under immense pressure to fit in and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,553600,555519,beating ourselves up for not being able
JwHCOI8V4LQ,555519,558160,to i'm sure all of you have such stories
JwHCOI8V4LQ,558160,560320,you read them or saw them and then the
JwHCOI8V4LQ,560320,562399,penny dropped oh this is what this is
JwHCOI8V4LQ,562399,565360,about and these stories shaped us
JwHCOI8V4LQ,565360,567440,where do you find them in books in
JwHCOI8V4LQ,567440,569760,movies and tv shows cartoons basically
JwHCOI8V4LQ,569760,572320,mass media and if mass media has such a
JwHCOI8V4LQ,572320,574800,profound impact on minds my purpose i
JwHCOI8V4LQ,574800,576399,believed as a cog in the wheel of mass
JwHCOI8V4LQ,576399,578640,media should be to find and tell such
JwHCOI8V4LQ,578640,582080,stories that inspire that motivate or at
JwHCOI8V4LQ,582080,583760,the very least that trigger ideas and
JwHCOI8V4LQ,583760,585680,conversations
JwHCOI8V4LQ,585680,587760,so that i would say became my purpose to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,587760,590720,shape ideas to make sense of the news to
JwHCOI8V4LQ,590720,593279,empower you to form your own opinion
JwHCOI8V4LQ,593279,594959,because you're intelligent
JwHCOI8V4LQ,594959,597680,intelligent enough to choose
