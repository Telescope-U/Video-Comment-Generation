geswqDSXs9s,1120,3560,hello this is chef john from
geswqDSXs9s,3560,6080,foodwishes.com with
geswqDSXs9s,6080,9360,armenian style potato salad
geswqDSXs9s,9360,11519,that's right potato salad is the first
geswqDSXs9s,11519,13759,food i can ever remember eating so i
geswqDSXs9s,13759,15280,really do have a deep emotional
geswqDSXs9s,15280,17359,attachment but every once in a while i
geswqDSXs9s,17359,19680,do crave something completely different
geswqDSXs9s,19680,21840,and this armenian style potato salad is
geswqDSXs9s,21840,23279,completely different
geswqDSXs9s,23279,25680,and completely delicious and unlike
geswqDSXs9s,25680,28400,american style completely safe left on a
geswqDSXs9s,28400,30560,sunny picnic table for hours
geswqDSXs9s,30560,32880,in fact it probably gets better
geswqDSXs9s,32880,34160,so with that let's go ahead and get
geswqDSXs9s,34160,36960,started by cutting up some potatoes
geswqDSXs9s,36960,38399,and my preferred choice for this would
geswqDSXs9s,38399,40640,be some yukon gold which i think have
geswqDSXs9s,40640,42879,the perfect texture for this salad
geswqDSXs9s,42879,44480,and what we'll do is cut that potato in
geswqDSXs9s,44480,45520,half
geswqDSXs9s,45520,48000,and then in half again to make quarters
geswqDSXs9s,48000,49280,and then we'll turn these and slice
geswqDSXs9s,49280,50320,across
geswqDSXs9s,50320,52559,into about quarter inch pieces
geswqDSXs9s,52559,54000,and if some of your potatoes are bigger
geswqDSXs9s,54000,55360,than the other ones
geswqDSXs9s,55360,57600,like the second one i'm about to cut is
geswqDSXs9s,57600,59280,instead of cutting that half into two to
geswqDSXs9s,59280,61359,make quarters we can give it two cuts to
geswqDSXs9s,61359,62800,make thirds
geswqDSXs9s,62800,64960,and that way once we slice across
geswqDSXs9s,64960,66960,even though that potato was bigger the
geswqDSXs9s,66960,68640,actual pieces will be about the same
geswqDSXs9s,68640,70799,size as the first potato
geswqDSXs9s,70799,72240,and of course if you want to leave the
geswqDSXs9s,72240,74080,skins on go ahead
geswqDSXs9s,74080,76000,personally i do not enjoy potato skins
geswqDSXs9s,76000,78960,in my salads but if you do include them
geswqDSXs9s,78960,81439,i mean you are after all the black swan
geswqDSXs9s,81439,83680,of whether you should leave the skin on
geswqDSXs9s,83680,85280,but to me they do kind of harshen up a
geswqDSXs9s,85280,87600,potato salad buzz but anyway we're gonna
geswqDSXs9s,87600,88960,go ahead and cut up three pounds of
geswqDSXs9s,88960,90400,yukon gold
geswqDSXs9s,90400,93360,or russet or really any potato you like
geswqDSXs9s,93360,94880,and then we'll transfer those into a pot
geswqDSXs9s,94880,96880,of nice cold fresh water
geswqDSXs9s,96880,98840,enough to cover the potatoes by a couple
geswqDSXs9s,98840,101040,inches and then we will set that pot
geswqDSXs9s,101040,102479,over high heat and bring it up to a
geswqDSXs9s,102479,103520,simmer
geswqDSXs9s,103520,104640,and then to this we're going to add a
geswqDSXs9s,104640,106799,nice big spoon of salt and then we're
geswqDSXs9s,106799,108399,also going to add one heaping tablespoon
geswqDSXs9s,108399,110720,of dried mint oh and if you can't find
geswqDSXs9s,110720,112159,that in the spice aisle which can
geswqDSXs9s,112159,114000,sometimes be a challenge you can
geswqDSXs9s,114000,115600,actually just buy some mint tea and
geswqDSXs9s,115600,117840,break open the bag since all that is is
geswqDSXs9s,117840,119200,dried mint
geswqDSXs9s,119200,120479,and we are going to add a whole bunch of
geswqDSXs9s,120479,122560,fresh mint later but fresh mint and
geswqDSXs9s,122560,124719,dried mint have two very distinctively
geswqDSXs9s,124719,126560,different flavors and i think by
geswqDSXs9s,126560,128160,including both here we have a much more
geswqDSXs9s,128160,129840,interesting salad
geswqDSXs9s,129840,131120,and then what we'll do once this comes
geswqDSXs9s,131120,133280,up to a boil is reduce our heat to
geswqDSXs9s,133280,136000,medium and as far as the doneness goes
geswqDSXs9s,136000,138480,we cannot undercook these potatoes
geswqDSXs9s,138480,140319,undercooked potatoes is a sin from which
geswqDSXs9s,140319,142800,there's no absolution but we also don't
geswqDSXs9s,142800,145120,want to fallen apart so after about five
geswqDSXs9s,145120,147120,or six minutes we'll start checking
geswqDSXs9s,147120,148800,and the tip of our knife should slide in
geswqDSXs9s,148800,150319,fairly easily
geswqDSXs9s,150319,152319,and we do want these tender but we do
geswqDSXs9s,152319,154239,not want them falling apart
geswqDSXs9s,154239,156480,and at this point mine were perfect
geswqDSXs9s,156480,157840,and once they are we're going to drain
geswqDSXs9s,157840,160000,those very very well
geswqDSXs9s,160000,161440,okay let them sit in a colander for at
geswqDSXs9s,161440,163360,least 5 or 10 minutes
geswqDSXs9s,163360,165360,and once they are very very well drained
geswqDSXs9s,165360,166720,we can go ahead and transfer those into
geswqDSXs9s,166720,168319,a large mixing bowl
geswqDSXs9s,168319,169840,where we will let them sit cooling down
geswqDSXs9s,169840,171040,a little bit
geswqDSXs9s,171040,173599,while we move on to the next component
geswqDSXs9s,173599,175360,which starts by adding half of our olive
geswqDSXs9s,175360,177760,oil to a skillet set over medium-high
geswqDSXs9s,177760,178800,heat
geswqDSXs9s,178800,180400,and after a couple minutes once that oil
geswqDSXs9s,180400,183440,is hot we will add our diced red onion
geswqDSXs9s,183440,185519,as well as some diced red pepper
geswqDSXs9s,185519,186800,and then last but not least we'll toss
geswqDSXs9s,186800,188959,in some minced garlic along with a nice
geswqDSXs9s,188959,190959,big pinch of salt
geswqDSXs9s,190959,192239,and then what we'll do is cook this
geswqDSXs9s,192239,194239,mixture for just one minute
geswqDSXs9s,194239,196159,that's it just one minute
geswqDSXs9s,196159,197360,since we're not trying to cook the
geswqDSXs9s,197360,200239,onions we are just deactivating those
geswqDSXs9s,200239,202720,volatile sulfuric compounds that give
geswqDSXs9s,202720,205280,onions that somewhat harsh sharp flavor
geswqDSXs9s,205280,206959,and yes traditionally these onions are
geswqDSXs9s,206959,209040,added raw which is fine if you eat the
geswqDSXs9s,209040,211440,salad right away but as it sits they get
geswqDSXs9s,211440,213200,stronger and stronger which can
geswqDSXs9s,213200,214799,eventually overwhelm the flavor of the
geswqDSXs9s,214799,216799,dish so by giving them a quick flash
geswqDSXs9s,216799,218879,saute at this point we still get the
geswqDSXs9s,218879,221200,texture of almost a raw onion but with a
geswqDSXs9s,221200,223280,sweeter milder flavor
geswqDSXs9s,223280,224879,and that's it after a quick one-minute
geswqDSXs9s,224879,227040,saute we will turn off the heat and
geswqDSXs9s,227040,228560,we'll go ahead and toss in another nice
geswqDSXs9s,228560,230560,big pinch of our dried mints
geswqDSXs9s,230560,232560,and we'll give that a quick stir
geswqDSXs9s,232560,234080,and we will simply reserve that there
geswqDSXs9s,234080,235519,with the heat off
geswqDSXs9s,235519,237200,while we move on to the juicing of the
geswqDSXs9s,237200,238400,lemons
geswqDSXs9s,238400,240159,and i don't always film this part and
geswqDSXs9s,240159,241840,sometimes just pour the lemon juice into
geswqDSXs9s,241840,243760,the recipe but i did want to show a
geswqDSXs9s,243760,245599,little bit of this footage so i can
geswqDSXs9s,245599,248000,reinforce the point the lemon juice has
geswqDSXs9s,248000,250959,to be must be has to be fresh
geswqDSXs9s,250959,252239,okay i don't want you using anything
geswqDSXs9s,252239,254560,from a concentrate or from one of those
geswqDSXs9s,254560,256079,little plastic bottles shaped like a
geswqDSXs9s,256079,258079,lemon right we need to find some fresh
geswqDSXs9s,258079,260320,lemons and squeeze them ourselves
geswqDSXs9s,260320,262479,and that's it once we have juice in hand
geswqDSXs9s,262479,264160,we will slowly drizzle that over our
geswqDSXs9s,264160,266400,still probably warm potatoes
geswqDSXs9s,266400,268720,and take your time and drizzle slowly
geswqDSXs9s,268720,270320,since we want these potatoes to absorb
geswqDSXs9s,270320,272560,the lemon juice very evenly and if we
geswqDSXs9s,272560,274560,just dump it all in in one spot that
geswqDSXs9s,274560,276639,might not happen as effectively
geswqDSXs9s,276639,278720,so yes we definitely want to drizzle for
geswqDSXs9s,278720,279840,chisel
geswqDSXs9s,279840,281919,sorry snoop i know i promised i'd stop
geswqDSXs9s,281919,283440,using that
geswqDSXs9s,283440,284639,and once that's in there we'll go ahead
geswqDSXs9s,284639,286000,and take our spatula and give this a
geswqDSXs9s,286000,287360,nice mix
geswqDSXs9s,287360,288960,oh and by the way the only way to screw
geswqDSXs9s,288960,291280,up this salad besides over or under
geswqDSXs9s,291280,293360,cooking the potatoes would be to coat
geswqDSXs9s,293360,295120,these with the olive oil first and then
geswqDSXs9s,295120,297360,add the lemon since if we add the oil
geswqDSXs9s,297360,299280,first it's going to coat the potato and
geswqDSXs9s,299280,300479,insulate them
geswqDSXs9s,300479,302240,and it will not absorb that lemon juice
geswqDSXs9s,302240,303199,as well
geswqDSXs9s,303199,304479,so you definitely want to go in this
geswqDSXs9s,304479,305440,order
geswqDSXs9s,305440,306880,and then once that lemon juice has been
geswqDSXs9s,306880,309120,spatulated in we'll go ahead and season
geswqDSXs9s,309120,310720,this up with a generous amount of kosher
geswqDSXs9s,310720,311759,salt
geswqDSXs9s,311759,314080,some freshly ground black pepper a
geswqDSXs9s,314080,316560,little bit of aleppo chili flake or just
geswqDSXs9s,316560,318160,regular chili flake
geswqDSXs9s,318160,319440,and then of course a few shakes of
geswqDSXs9s,319440,321759,cayenne just a stain shape
geswqDSXs9s,321759,323440,and then we'll also toss in some freshly
geswqDSXs9s,323440,325120,sliced green onions
geswqDSXs9s,325120,326479,which i think is going to pair perfectly
geswqDSXs9s,326479,328960,with those slightly cooked red onions
geswqDSXs9s,328960,331600,which will be the next thing we add
geswqDSXs9s,331600,333039,and then we will finish up with the rest
geswqDSXs9s,333039,334800,of our olive oil
geswqDSXs9s,334800,336479,plus a whole bunch of freshly chopped
geswqDSXs9s,336479,338479,italian parsley
geswqDSXs9s,338479,340479,and a very generous amount of freshly
geswqDSXs9s,340479,342240,sliced mint
geswqDSXs9s,342240,343600,and that's it we'll take our spatula and
geswqDSXs9s,343600,345919,give this a very thorough mixing
geswqDSXs9s,345919,347600,and besides mixing all these ingredients
geswqDSXs9s,347600,349360,together we also at this point can
geswqDSXs9s,349360,351759,affect the final texture by deciding how
geswqDSXs9s,351759,354240,much to smash these potatoes as we mix
geswqDSXs9s,354240,355919,okay i like to break these potatoes up a
geswqDSXs9s,355919,357600,little bit but i do want to leave the
geswqDSXs9s,357600,359680,majority of them close to their original
geswqDSXs9s,359680,362080,size whereas other versions feature
geswqDSXs9s,362080,363759,potatoes that have been smashed up so
geswqDSXs9s,363759,365600,small it's almost like a mashed potato
geswqDSXs9s,365600,366479,salad
geswqDSXs9s,366479,368000,in fact the first time i ever had
geswqDSXs9s,368000,369840,armenian potato salad it was done like
geswqDSXs9s,369840,370639,that
geswqDSXs9s,370639,371919,so you can play around with that
geswqDSXs9s,371919,373039,yourself
geswqDSXs9s,373039,374479,but right here you can see how much i'm
geswqDSXs9s,374479,376000,gonna mix mine
geswqDSXs9s,376000,377600,and that's it all we have left to do is
geswqDSXs9s,377600,379520,wrap this up and pop it in the fridge
geswqDSXs9s,379520,381680,for a few hours until it's well chilled
geswqDSXs9s,381680,383360,and all those flavors have had time to
geswqDSXs9s,383360,384479,marry
geswqDSXs9s,384479,385759,and sure you could taste it at this
geswqDSXs9s,385759,387520,point before you wrap it up but i think
geswqDSXs9s,387520,389039,it's a little more accurate to taste and
geswqDSXs9s,389039,391280,adjust after it's had time to sit and
geswqDSXs9s,391280,393440,the flavors have fully developed
geswqDSXs9s,393440,395280,so that's my strategy
geswqDSXs9s,395280,396720,so i wrapped this up and popped it in
geswqDSXs9s,396720,398560,the fridge for a few hours
geswqDSXs9s,398560,400319,at which point then i unwrapped it and
geswqDSXs9s,400319,402800,gave it a good stir and then a taste
geswqDSXs9s,402800,405039,and it was amazing except it definitely
geswqDSXs9s,405039,407440,needed more salt which i did mix in off
geswqDSXs9s,407440,409599,camera so as not to bore you
geswqDSXs9s,409599,411599,oh and just a quick reminder that if you
geswqDSXs9s,411599,414080,don't like this it's probably your fault
geswqDSXs9s,414080,415280,since you are definitely going to want
geswqDSXs9s,415280,417199,to adjust this to your personal taste
geswqDSXs9s,417199,418880,when it comes to how much lemon and how
geswqDSXs9s,418880,421680,much olive oil and how much pepper and
geswqDSXs9s,421680,422960,as we've already mentioned of course
geswqDSXs9s,422960,424160,this salt
geswqDSXs9s,424160,426479,so keep adjusting until you're happy and
geswqDSXs9s,426479,428400,hopefully very happy
geswqDSXs9s,428400,429840,and then once that was adjusted i went
geswqDSXs9s,429840,431680,ahead and served up
geswqDSXs9s,431680,433680,which we could do in a bowl but for
geswqDSXs9s,433680,435360,whatever reason i think a potato salad
geswqDSXs9s,435360,437840,like this looks nicer on a platter
geswqDSXs9s,437840,440000,and then for a final touch i like to
geswqDSXs9s,440000,441680,drizzle a little more olive oil over the
geswqDSXs9s,441680,442880,top
geswqDSXs9s,442880,444479,plus since it is one of the signature
geswqDSXs9s,444479,446400,ingredients i'll finish up with a little
geswqDSXs9s,446400,448639,more freshly sliced mints
geswqDSXs9s,448639,450800,and that's it our armenian style potato
geswqDSXs9s,450800,453120,salad is ready to enjoy
geswqDSXs9s,453120,454479,and that my friends if you're looking
geswqDSXs9s,454479,456080,for a change of pace from the
geswqDSXs9s,456080,458479,traditional american style potato salad
geswqDSXs9s,458479,461039,is definitely i think the way to go
geswqDSXs9s,461039,462479,right the word that comes to mind to
geswqDSXs9s,462479,465199,describe this after delicious
geswqDSXs9s,465199,466800,is refreshing
geswqDSXs9s,466800,469120,which is kind of refreshing since when i
geswqDSXs9s,469120,470960,usually think of a potato salad i think
geswqDSXs9s,470960,471919,rich
geswqDSXs9s,471919,473120,comforting
geswqDSXs9s,473120,474400,filling
geswqDSXs9s,474400,475919,and not necessarily something that's
geswqDSXs9s,475919,478560,light and vibrant and as i just said
geswqDSXs9s,478560,481120,very refreshing so this really is at the
geswqDSXs9s,481120,483440,opposite end of the spectrum but once in
geswqDSXs9s,483440,485759,a while a couple times during the summer
geswqDSXs9s,485759,488000,it's exactly what i want
geswqDSXs9s,488000,490240,and i love potato salad so much i could
geswqDSXs9s,490240,492560,just eat this as a meal but if i were
geswqDSXs9s,492560,494479,gonna serve this as a side dish it
geswqDSXs9s,494479,495840,doesn't get any better than with some
geswqDSXs9s,495840,497759,sliced roasted lamb
geswqDSXs9s,497759,499520,topped with some beautiful accumulated
geswqDSXs9s,499520,500639,juices
geswqDSXs9s,500639,502400,oh yeah now that is a meat and potato
geswqDSXs9s,502400,504400,pairing made in heaven
geswqDSXs9s,504400,506639,but anyway that's it what i'm calling
geswqDSXs9s,506639,509120,armenian style potato salad
geswqDSXs9s,509120,510879,when it comes to potato cells my first
geswqDSXs9s,510879,512959,love will always be the classic american
