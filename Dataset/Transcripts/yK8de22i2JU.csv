yK8de22i2JU,2000,4316,It's AumSum Time.
yK8de22i2JU,5742,7133,How do Mirrors Work?
yK8de22i2JU,7875,8659,Simple.
yK8de22i2JU,9053,13098,They work because AumSum is so handsome.
yK8de22i2JU,13557,14752,Oh AumSum.
yK8de22i2JU,15808,20559,To buy AumSum merchandise visit AumSum.com.
yK8de22i2JU,22320,24017,"See, when light hits an apple."
yK8de22i2JU,24279,28765,It absorbs all the colors of light except for red. Red is reflected back.
yK8de22i2JU,29420,31440,"Hence, the apple appears red."
yK8de22i2JU,32880,36850,"Now, a mirror consists of a glass surface with an extremely smooth."
yK8de22i2JU,36850,39441,And thin layer of metal film behind it. 
yK8de22i2JU,41451,45890,"When light hits a mirror, it passes through the glass part and reaches the metal film. "
yK8de22i2JU,46390,49357,The metal film does not absorb any colors of light. 
yK8de22i2JU,49513,51321,It reflects back all of them.
yK8de22i2JU,51867,54706,Hence we are able to see ourselves in a mirror.
yK8de22i2JU,55971,62320,"But, even snow reflects all the colors of light, then why can't we see our reflection in it? "
yK8de22i2JU,63120,65724,The answer lies in smoothness.
yK8de22i2JU,65964,68110,Snow has a rough Bumpy surface
yK8de22i2JU,68721,70808,It reflects back light in all directions.
yK8de22i2JU,71485,76037,While the metal film being extremely  smooth reflects back light more directly.
