JUbAFM2Fauk,146879,149520,war is on right now but this is one of
JUbAFM2Fauk,149520,151680,the worst fights we have seen in a long
JUbAFM2Fauk,151680,153920,long time tensions were heated right
JUbAFM2Fauk,153920,156400,away at the very start of the ball game

JUbAFM2Fauk,170160,172160,this game this is one of the worst i've
JUbAFM2Fauk,172160,174400,seen in a long long time and this is a
JUbAFM2Fauk,174400,176560,difficult time for the umpires to decide
JUbAFM2Fauk,176560,178720,how to be able to restore order now but
JUbAFM2Fauk,178720,180319,you know what when mike trout gets
JUbAFM2Fauk,180319,181840,thrown up and in like that that's a
JUbAFM2Fauk,181840,183840,difference maker here are the objections
