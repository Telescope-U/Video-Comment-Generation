KlFua-CaECo,140,7440,failure is a step to success falling  down is a step to success losing is a
KlFua-CaECo,7440,16590,step to success pain is a step to  success but quitting is not never give
KlFua-CaECo,16590,22350,up on what you really want to do this is
KlFua-CaECo,22350,29310,the instinct that says you've had enough  this is the instinct that says you've
KlFua-CaECo,29310,37710,given it your best shot you can you can  stand down you can back off you can take
KlFua-CaECo,37710,44250,a knee don't stop when you're tired  stop when you're done we are relentless

KlFua-CaECo,58800,63410,goals this is the instinct that says
KlFua-CaECo,68040,77010,do not listen to that instinct do not  listen that instinct is a liar and wants
KlFua-CaECo,77010,82590,to bring you down you don't judge a  person by where they stand in times of  comfort and convenience you judging by
KlFua-CaECo,82590,88980,where they stand in times of challenge  and controversy when you work for  something and give you a different type  of attachment to it the harder you work
KlFua-CaECo,88980,97080,the harder it is to surrender as long as  we're willing to put the work in we will  get there in the end as long as we never
KlFua-CaECo,97080,102510,quit they stomp on pretty mine so what's  the pretty in mind let's say it's day

KlFua-CaECo,174280,180760,will fight is with yourself this battle  will never go away it's a fight you will
KlFua-CaECo,180760,186489,have to battle for the rest of your life  you are the only person that can get
KlFua-CaECo,186489,192519,yourself back up but you're also the  only person that can lie down and allow
KlFua-CaECo,192519,197549,yourself to be defeated don't fail
KlFua-CaECo,197549,202640,yourself today
KlFua-CaECo,202640,208850,quitting is never an option don't fail  yourself today
KlFua-CaECo,208850,214430,is it so many of our limitations are  self-imposed mm-hmm you know and we sets
KlFua-CaECo,214430,222050,we set something up in our brain we  program our brain one way and that's our  limit and until we can get past that and
KlFua-CaECo,222050,227630,see what we're really made of and like  get uncomfortable and experience pain  you can't real you don't really don't
KlFua-CaECo,227630,233450,know what you're capable of when you  feel you've exhausted every option  remember you haven't if I could count
KlFua-CaECo,233450,239360,the amount of times I was told no though  I created the mentality in my head of  taking no as no not right now not no
KlFua-CaECo,239360,244640,this isn't for you if I had given up  after the first time I had said no I  wouldn't be here and so it just you know
KlFua-CaECo,244640,250040,not letting someone dictate your future  if you believe in something so strongly  and you want to do something so strongly
KlFua-CaECo,250040,256100,who's gonna tell you to not do it  there's never a failure unless you quit  so if you keep going there's not a
KlFua-CaECo,256100,262460,failure just keep changing and moving  the person with big dreams is more  powerful than the person with all the
KlFua-CaECo,262460,268430,facts but it's not so much about the  opposition and adversity that we face as  it is about the perspective that we have
KlFua-CaECo,268430,274669,about the opposition and adversity that  we face meaning perspective drives  performance every day of the week how do
KlFua-CaECo,274669,282020,you view what you do will always affect  how you do what you do don't stop when  you're tired stop when you are done once
KlFua-CaECo,282020,289040,a quitter always a quitter prove them  wrong you are relentless you will never
KlFua-CaECo,289040,295520,stop this isn't a game to you this is  life or death  people don't burn out because of what
KlFua-CaECo,295520,300800,they do people burn out because life  makes stuff forget why they do it  character supersedes talent every bit of
KlFua-CaECo,300800,307370,week no retreat no surrender  you never we die by this everyman my
KlFua-CaECo,307370,312569,searches on a soul at a certain point  don't let your actions betray your words  you are
KlFua-CaECo,312569,320490,not going to give up because of a little  pain you won't quit because of a bad  situation it isn't in your nature to
KlFua-CaECo,320490,328469,give up on this you don't stop in your  time you stop when you're done you stop
KlFua-CaECo,328469,337529,when you get the job done you finish  when you have done enough work to make  progress a little pain along the way is
KlFua-CaECo,337529,344429,your rite of passage  it is the battle scars of the successful  the marks of a warrior who succeed at
KlFua-CaECo,344429,351990,this adventure through life what will  your scars say about you how many
KlFua-CaECo,351990,358199,battles will you pull through to come  out the other side a winner come out the
KlFua-CaECo,358199,365279,other side and ultimate version of  yourself never give up on what you
KlFua-CaECo,365279,373309,really want to do and they'll say it's  not your fault
KlFua-CaECo,373860,386150,and they'll tell you it's okay to stop  it's okay to settle it's okay to give up
KlFua-CaECo,394980,411990,[Music]
KlFua-CaECo,411990,418259,and that is the instinct you need to  fight you need to push back to smash
KlFua-CaECo,418259,426690,into the ground do not take the easy way  out you think that successful people
KlFua-CaECo,426690,434690,have some lucky charm well let me tell  you something I woke up this morning I  couldn't find my [ __ ] lucky charm I
KlFua-CaECo,434690,441560,and other successful people wake up  every day doing the same thing fighting
KlFua-CaECo,441560,448889,fighting back against the distractions  the fears the doubts do not give up
KlFua-CaECo,448889,457440,based on instinct if you are forced to  stand down to retreat so that you can
KlFua-CaECo,457440,463009,rebuild Andrea tack so be it
KlFua-CaECo,463009,471080,and we learn over time we build into a  habit to spend more time having control
KlFua-CaECo,471080,476560,instead of more time  being out of control
KlFua-CaECo,476759,487009,it does matter but make that decision  based on logic not on the instinct of
KlFua-CaECo,487009,493159,surrender and defeat opposition
KlFua-CaECo,493159,499499,adversity challenge never forget why you  do what you do I'm not talking about
KlFua-CaECo,499499,505680,college I'm not talking about when you  first got to the lead and you got  drafted I'm talking about you is coming
KlFua-CaECo,505680,513149,up using the street or use at the paw  and your mom had to go sacrifice and
KlFua-CaECo,513149,518459,work so you get your pair clean and  talking about that bite is everybody on
KlFua-CaECo,518459,525060,remember that your will and desire to  win are greater than anybody else's I
KlFua-CaECo,525060,531360,know you are aware of how bad you want  this  I know you are aware of what you would
KlFua-CaECo,531360,538410,give to succeed I know you want this I  know it is all you want I know what you
KlFua-CaECo,538410,545550,would give for this so do it show it  prove it  show the world kill them that anything
KlFua-CaECo,545550,552690,you can dream up can become your reality  success is getting back up and learning
KlFua-CaECo,552690,558389,from these Falls learning from the pain  and the losses success lies and getting
KlFua-CaECo,558389,566069,back to your feet and trying again  how does a young kid with its Liam and I  believe in himself and for many times I
KlFua-CaECo,566069,571110,laughed I did not believe the input you  know what nothing external can can can
KlFua-CaECo,571110,576300,defeat the internal the only girl that  can take someone down or break you down  as internal nothing external is strong
KlFua-CaECo,576300,583260,enough it's just about making sure your  internal dialogue in your internal  belief and just have a strong enough  that it can withstand the external the
KlFua-CaECo,583260,590860,external is there you've got to accept  it you've got to embrace it you've got  to understand that and be aware  but don't let it seep into into your
KlFua-CaECo,590860,602139,internal dialogue don't fail yourself  today for most people man you could be
KlFua-CaECo,602139,607529,great but you haven't even pulled a  strip off the activator right like you  can be great but you live alone reserved
KlFua-CaECo,607529,613000,right you didn't you didn't empty the  bucket right you didn't give everything  you had to every aspect of your life
KlFua-CaECo,613000,619839,like for most people they're great  professionally but they end up becoming  a public success and behind closed doors
KlFua-CaECo,619839,626199,they're private failure not because they  don't have the talent or the skill set  they don't have the character right that
KlFua-CaECo,626199,631510,they can apply it and be consistent in  every aspect of their life and empty out
KlFua-CaECo,631510,639070,everything they got to everything right  of course you don't just give everything  you've got all the time right you get to
KlFua-CaECo,639070,644139,a point to where you learn to be  efficient and effective in every aspect
KlFua-CaECo,644139,650620,of your life and for most people is not  a problem of skill set that's a problem  with character and empty the bucket is
KlFua-CaECo,650620,656800,having the right character to be  consistent and empty out everything you  got in every aspect of your life
KlFua-CaECo,656800,662360,[Music]  there was a lot of moments in my life
KlFua-CaECo,662360,668720,career it was people that saw things in  me that I couldn't see in myself and  they believed in me in a way that I
KlFua-CaECo,668720,675150,couldn't believe in myself yet and I  rented their level but for me it's how I  got strong enough to possess my own I
KlFua-CaECo,675150,681080,[Music]  just like when you're young and see you  and it's like even when you start out
KlFua-CaECo,681080,688040,doing what you do it you can be talented  right and somebody older than you are  more experienced than you can see you in
KlFua-CaECo,688040,694280,know like oh man if he did this if he  does this and he could be great right
KlFua-CaECo,694280,701540,and they can come to your sake they came  and got something you could be great by  it like my teachers and my coaches when
KlFua-CaECo,701540,707750,they came to me and like son telling you  to go to college man like you really I  know you're talking about it but your
KlFua-CaECo,707750,714710,circumstances are saying different I  think you can do it right and when they  said it I'm like oh I can I can do it
KlFua-CaECo,714710,720490,but not gonna make it happen because  they're believing in me making it happen  I think I can do it
KlFua-CaECo,720490,728750,like I think we show you think that's  powerful  I think exposure sparks inspiration by
KlFua-CaECo,728750,735980,exposure its parts motivation and my  mindset can never go back to the way
KlFua-CaECo,735980,741530,that it once was because I have been  exposed to something different to
KlFua-CaECo,741530,746750,something new so I think belief an  exposure or two of the most powerful
KlFua-CaECo,746750,753050,things that can happen to a person like  when you're young or when you do
KlFua-CaECo,753050,758720,something in your novels right and you  start out doing it and you might think  you can do something with it or you
KlFua-CaECo,758720,766820,might not you might do it and it's being  driven by your passion and then somebody
KlFua-CaECo,766820,774080,comes alone that's a little bit older or  even more experienced and they can see  it in a way that you can't see it right
KlFua-CaECo,774080,780110,and so I think is important with belief  because if a person believes in you in a  way that you don't believe in yourself
KlFua-CaECo,780110,785920,you can rent that person's belief until  you get strong enough to possess your  own
KlFua-CaECo,785929,792209,right and you use that person's belief  to feel you every single day right  because you can have a level of belief
KlFua-CaECo,792209,798809,with what you're doing but you can go  back to a certain set of circumstances  that tell you now it's not gonna happen
KlFua-CaECo,798809,807389,and so you read that person's belief  until you get strong enough to possess  your own I firmly believe every person's
KlFua-CaECo,807389,812879,purpose is tied to somebody else's  purpose in destiny and so your purpose
KlFua-CaECo,812879,818100,my purpose is tied to somebody else like  when I speak when I do what I do like
KlFua-CaECo,818100,824850,people say all it may man I really need  to be here that right that helped me do  this that helped get me through this
KlFua-CaECo,824850,830639,that helped me with this that's my  purpose being tied to other people's
KlFua-CaECo,830639,836970,purpose destiny beliefs and dreams  that's the power magic of purpose right  I don't think it can be a purpose
KlFua-CaECo,836970,844470,without being tied to other people's  purpose destiny dreams and aspirations  right I think that's the power in it but
KlFua-CaECo,844470,851429,realizing it is another thing the only  thing I felt I had that advantage in my
KlFua-CaECo,851429,857489,whole life was my work ethic and I took  pride in that right I was never the  biggest the fastest the strongest
KlFua-CaECo,857489,863249,never had the most resources but I had a  workout thing I think what's most
KlFua-CaECo,863249,869879,important is when we go through  something what's the perspective that we  have up right because for most people
KlFua-CaECo,869879,876660,when you go through something the  person's natural perspective is okay  what did I lose right what happened to
KlFua-CaECo,876660,883980,me like I took a loss right people never  look at it and say okay man tell me what  did you gain right even though I know it
KlFua-CaECo,883980,890039,hurt you didn't want to go through it  but look at it in a way to where you can  say what's the lesson than this right
KlFua-CaECo,890039,896959,what would you say life is trying to  teach you from dealing with this  and affirm you believe the quicker you
KlFua-CaECo,896959,903680,can shift your perspective from yourself  to others when you're in the midst of  adversity the quicker you'll get through
KlFua-CaECo,903680,905709,it
KlFua-CaECo,909380,916010,I think I think having a purpose it's
KlFua-CaECo,916010,921290,that thing that that makes us tick that  gets us up every day and gets us over
KlFua-CaECo,921290,928880,the hump of opposition and adversity and  a reason that I champion adversity in  opposition is because I think for the
KlFua-CaECo,928880,936050,most part in life people pretty much  know what to do when things go right  right like when things go right they
KlFua-CaECo,936050,944270,know how to feel they know how to act  how to react but it's when that  opposition and that versity comes and it
KlFua-CaECo,944270,951620,creates a level of misunderstanding  right now the vision is blurred now you  don't have clarity about what you're
KlFua-CaECo,951620,957260,supposed to do now you question if your  existence matters and I think when you
KlFua-CaECo,957260,962360,have a purpose it's powerful because in  the midst of the Opposition it makes you
KlFua-CaECo,962360,968740,realize that you've been put here for  certain reason  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,968740,975880,this too shall pass right the reason I  would say that is like I said I champion
KlFua-CaECo,975880,982630,diversity all right we know what to do  when things go right but the next time  it gets tough the next time you question
KlFua-CaECo,982630,988390,your purpose the next time you question  your existence your mission if you're
KlFua-CaECo,988390,993400,supposed to be doing what you're doing  and it gets tough and challenging just
KlFua-CaECo,993400,1000450,whisper to yourself this too shall pass  this too shall pass if you actually want
KlFua-CaECo,1000450,1010110,something you can have it you have to
KlFua-CaECo,1010110,1015990,treat yourself like you matter because  if you don't then you don't take care of  yourself and you become vengeful and and
KlFua-CaECo,1015990,1023040,and cruel and you you take you take it  out on people around you and you're not  a positive force none of that's good so
KlFua-CaECo,1023040,1028079,you suffer more and so does everyone  around you and there's a malevolence  that enters into it none of that's good
KlFua-CaECo,1028079,1034620,so that's what happens if you don't  treat yourself like you matter the first
KlFua-CaECo,1034620,1040360,thing I would say is well you should be  afraid of taking risks and pursuing  something meaningful
KlFua-CaECo,1040360,1048569,one of the main reasons that people  don't get what they want is because they  don't actually figure out what it is and
KlFua-CaECo,1048569,1054100,the probability that you're going to get  what would be good for you let's say  which would even be better than what you
KlFua-CaECo,1054100,1060220,want right because you know you might be  what wrong about what you want easily  but maybe you could get what would
KlFua-CaECo,1060220,1065890,really be good for you  well why don't you well because you
KlFua-CaECo,1065890,1072880,don't try  [Music]  life is a challenge that in some sense
KlFua-CaECo,1072880,1078190,can't be surmounted so there's no way  out of your problem but there are  certainly proper ways of dealing with it
KlFua-CaECo,1078190,1087399,you sit on your bed one day and ask  yourself ah what's what remarkably
KlFua-CaECo,1087399,1093210,stupid things am i doing on a regular  basis to absolutely screw up my life I
KlFua-CaECo,1093210,1098789,would say that the goal in life is to  conduct yourself so that life improves
KlFua-CaECo,1098789,1106389,you should be more afraid of staying  where you are if it's making you  miserable clock is ticking yeah and if
KlFua-CaECo,1106389,1111610,you're miserable in your job now and you  change nothing in five years you'll be  much more miserable and you'll be a lot
KlFua-CaECo,1111610,1119830,older people don't get what they want  and they need because they don't aim at  it and it's a hard lesson for people to
KlFua-CaECo,1119830,1127299,learn because they're cynical to begin  with and they presume that there's no  possible way of moving forward but it's
KlFua-CaECo,1127299,1134289,not so unreasonable to assume that  you're not going to hit what you don't  aim at or you're not going to hit what
KlFua-CaECo,1134289,1141130,you aim at and don't shoot at  we're built to contend with the world  we're built to contend with reality you
KlFua-CaECo,1141130,1147010,want a challenge and the best way that  you can take on a challenge because the  challenge fortifies you so you don't
KlFua-CaECo,1147010,1152769,want to be secure you want to be strong  and you get strong by taking on optimal  challenges and so you lay out your
KlFua-CaECo,1152769,1160090,destiny in the world and you take the  slings and arrows of fate and you make  yourself stronger while you're doing so  and you might fail and fortune might do
KlFua-CaECo,1160090,1165580,you in but it's your best bet huge part  of the reason that people fail is
KlFua-CaECo,1165580,1173110,because they don't ever set up the  criteria for success  and so since success is a very narrow
KlFua-CaECo,1173110,1180519,line and very unlikely the probability  that you're going to stumble on it  randomly is zero so you want to set
KlFua-CaECo,1180519,1185740,yourself a task that's difficult but not  so difficult you can't attain it and  then what happens is that you step up
KlFua-CaECo,1185740,1192760,improvement across time incremental II  and there's also a certain element of  humility to it right which is don't bite
KlFua-CaECo,1192760,1198700,off more than you can chew right don't  set grandiose goals but incremental  improvement will get you a tremendous
KlFua-CaECo,1198700,1202750,distance  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,1208270,1214509,[Music]  it's a luxury to pursue what makes you  happy it's a moral obligation to pursue
KlFua-CaECo,1214509,1221200,what you find meaningful and that  doesn't mean it's easy it might require  sacrifice if you need to change your job
KlFua-CaECo,1221200,1228429,to let's say you have family and and and  and children and a mortgage you have  responsibilities you've already picked
KlFua-CaECo,1228429,1234039,up those responsibilities you don't just  get to walk away scot-free and say well  I don't like my job I quit
KlFua-CaECo,1234039,1240159,that's no strategy but what you might  have to do is you think well this job is  killing my soul all right so what do I
KlFua-CaECo,1240159,1246460,have to do about that well I have to  look for another job well no one wants  to hire me it's like okay maybe you need
KlFua-CaECo,1246460,1253119,to educate yourself more maybe you need  to update your your curriculum vitae  your resume maybe you need to overcome
KlFua-CaECo,1253119,1258460,your fear of being interviewed I think
KlFua-CaECo,1258460,1265210,what you have to do and this is part of  humility is you have to look around you  within your sphere of influence like the
KlFua-CaECo,1265210,1270429,direct sphere of influence and fix the  things that announce themselves as in
KlFua-CaECo,1270429,1275879,need of repair and those are often small  things you know and they can be like
KlFua-CaECo,1275879,1281139,your room put it in order because the  thing is it isn't exactly so important
KlFua-CaECo,1281139,1287080,that your room is in order although it  is what's important is that you learn  how to distinguish between chaos and
KlFua-CaECo,1287080,1293440,order and to be able to act in a manner  that produces order three years from now
KlFua-CaECo,1293440,1300369,you can have what you need you got to be  careful about it you can't have  everything you can have what would be
KlFua-CaECo,1300369,1308109,good for you but you have to figure out  what it is and then you have to aim at  it and when you're in the zone you're
KlFua-CaECo,1308109,1314529,expanding your skills in a manner that's  intrinsically rewarding because you're
KlFua-CaECo,1314529,1320379,succeeding and so you want to set if you  are good to yourself you think okay I  need to set a goal but I need to set a
KlFua-CaECo,1320379,1325629,goal that someone is stupid and useless  as me could probably attain if they put
KlFua-CaECo,1325629,1331270,some effort into it  you know if there are things about your  life that are bothering you or things
KlFua-CaECo,1331270,1339070,about the world that are bothering you  then you want to decompose them into  solvable subproblems you can do
KlFua-CaECo,1339070,1345000,something as simple as just sit on your  bed and think okay there's probably like  five things I could do today so that
KlFua-CaECo,1345000,1351520,tomorrow morning is slightly better than  this morning was at least or at least  I'm not falling behind and those will
KlFua-CaECo,1351520,1357730,usually be it's like having to eat a  toad in the morning right it's like it's  not gonna be something you want to do  there'll be things you're trying to
KlFua-CaECo,1357730,1363340,avoid there's snakes essentially bury  yourself to who you were yesterday not
KlFua-CaECo,1363340,1368350,to who someone else is today I've dealt  with hundreds of people in my clinical
KlFua-CaECo,1368350,1376779,and consulting practice and we set a  goal we develop a vision and work  towards it and it things inevitably get
KlFua-CaECo,1376779,1383080,better for people so it's not a luxury  it's it's difficult it's a moral  responsibility and it isn't happiness
KlFua-CaECo,1383080,1387149,it's it's not the pursuit isn't for  happiness
KlFua-CaECo,1391559,1397029,well greatness is what reveals itself  when you when you attempt to formulate
KlFua-CaECo,1397029,1402809,when you attempt to carefully articulate  and live out what you believe to be true
KlFua-CaECo,1402809,1408700,it just happens because there isn't  anything more powerful than truth right
KlFua-CaECo,1408700,1413190,that's the antidote to suffering truth
KlFua-CaECo,1414840,1422279,if you ask yourself instead of telling  yourself you know what is it that I  could do to set things more right today
KlFua-CaECo,1422279,1427570,that I would actually do it's usually  some small thing cuz you're not that
KlFua-CaECo,1427570,1433539,disciplined you know then you can go do  it lay a disciplinary structure on
KlFua-CaECo,1433539,1441130,yourself get the chaos in in in check  and then you can move towards a state  that's freer well what happens if you
KlFua-CaECo,1441130,1448450,don't treat other people like they  matter  well you lie to them you cheat them you  steal you you you enter into impulsive
KlFua-CaECo,1448450,1454450,relationships with them they can't trust  you that doesn't go anywhere they don't  like you you you end up alone at best
KlFua-CaECo,1454450,1462249,and maybe like incarcerated at worst  like that doesn't work  and so you watch the people around you
KlFua-CaECo,1462249,1470529,who thrive regardless of what they say  they act out the proposition that  everyone matters if you're hungry and
KlFua-CaECo,1470529,1476499,you eat well that's good but it's over  and then you're on to the next thing  right it's not exactly sustaining it's
KlFua-CaECo,1476499,1482139,just necessary that's called consume  Ettore reward by the way this other  reward system is incentive reward and
KlFua-CaECo,1482139,1488289,the incentive reward system works on  dopamine this neurochemical dopamine  which is also the neurochemical tracks
KlFua-CaECo,1488289,1494679,that opiates and cocaine and  amphetamines the drugs that people  really like to abuse alcohol often for
KlFua-CaECo,1494679,1501129,some people activate and so you might  say if you don't have enough meaning in  your life then you're more prone to
KlFua-CaECo,1501129,1506859,addiction and that's definitely the case  even with rats if you take a rat you put  him in a cage by himself and he has
KlFua-CaECo,1506859,1511929,nothing to do and then you give him  access to cocaine he'll get addicted to  the point where he won't do anything but
KlFua-CaECo,1511929,1517539,take cocaine but if you throw the rat  back in with a bunch of other rats and  he gets to do rap things then it's very
KlFua-CaECo,1517539,1523779,hard to get him addicted to cocaine and  so the purposeless rat is prone to  addiction well it's the same with human
KlFua-CaECo,1523779,1525989,beings
KlFua-CaECo,1529350,1536130,kind of have this idea that that you  have a certain delightful wonderful  positive freedom as a child and then
KlFua-CaECo,1536130,1543090,that's given up as you approach  adulthood but the truth of the matter is  is that you have a lot of potential as a
KlFua-CaECo,1543090,1549300,child but none of that is capable of  manifesting itself as freedom before you  become disciplined and discipline is a
KlFua-CaECo,1549300,1556470,matter of the imposition of order and  the order is necessary especially for  people who are hopeless and nihilistic  and lots of people are hopeless and
KlFua-CaECo,1556470,1565770,nihilistic way more people than you  think and part of that is because no  one's ever really encouraged them the
KlFua-CaECo,1565770,1572550,magnitude of the reward you experience  as you're moving towards a goal is  proportionate to the importance of the
KlFua-CaECo,1572550,1577830,goal so that means the more important  the goal you pick the more possibility
KlFua-CaECo,1577830,1582870,there is for the kind of reward let's  say that it's really a state of being
KlFua-CaECo,1582870,1589710,that is life-affirming and it is  directly life-affirming in that you know
KlFua-CaECo,1589710,1596760,like if you're in a football game and  you're and it's an important football  game and maybe you break a finger and  you know normally that's that's a
KlFua-CaECo,1596760,1603840,problem it hurts and you're gonna stop  doing whatever you're doing but if  you're right in the middle of the game  then you'll be so amped up on this
KlFua-CaECo,1603840,1609290,reward system that its analgesic it  stops the pain it also suppresses  anxiety
KlFua-CaECo,1609290,1614899,[Music]  people that have extracted unbelievable
KlFua-CaECo,1614899,1621379,successes out of catastrophic failures  and so and I'm not saying that in a  naive way I know perfectly well what
KlFua-CaECo,1621379,1626600,happens to people you know you're doing  fine in life and then you get cancer and  then six months later you're dead and
KlFua-CaECo,1626600,1634519,all the heroism in the world isn't going  to save you at that point but that's not  the point  that's not the point life is bounded by
KlFua-CaECo,1634519,1640669,mortality but that doesn't mean that you  don't get out there and contend and you  develop by contending and you minimize
KlFua-CaECo,1640669,1668059,the net amount of suffering in the world  and that's something man that's  something to do we're working our ass
KlFua-CaECo,1668059,1675649,off working hard you know we've been  working out hard in the gym for a month  but we haven't seen any results so we
KlFua-CaECo,1675649,1681769,get off down there poopy pants you stay  for 30 minutes for a test and you do as

KlFua-CaECo,1689229,1694309,may because what is your secret man  what's your secret about business what
KlFua-CaECo,1694309,1702230,you think about this what you think  about that you don't want the answer the  answer is you see these hands
KlFua-CaECo,1702230,1714080,the hard work man yeah they look at  suffering as almost like I look at  failure to succeed you must fail learn

KlFua-CaECo,2106450,2114210,scariest thing in the world to me even  to this day was that that could have  been the rest of my life
KlFua-CaECo,2114580,2123820,I thought then I was trying hard  sometimes life is [ __ ] hard so when I
KlFua-CaECo,2123820,2131140,first joined the Navy I had to join the  reserves because I couldn't get an  active duty time so fast so being at

KlFua-CaECo,2144820,2150760,biggest purpose in life isn't all that  it's how you respect yourself how you  look at yourself I see every day for
KlFua-CaECo,2150760,2155779,journey  you're not working your butt off are you
KlFua-CaECo,2155779,2164059,not trying hard enough we all think  we're trying hard but what are you  engaging that off of in life from office

KlFua-CaECo,2210290,2215330,them it was like a punishment those are  the biggest words of all time
KlFua-CaECo,2215330,2222020,as far as respecting yourself trying  hard is something in your mind just
KlFua-CaECo,2222020,2228830,doesn't stop only those people who have
KlFua-CaECo,2228830,2234980,been there a million times in their  minds and have suffered a million times
KlFua-CaECo,2234980,2246560,it realized my legs may break my knee  may break and accept that I know right

KlFua-CaECo,2284770,2291490,our neighborhood a lot of shooting a lot  of violence unfortunately for me at the  age of five you know I got shot you know
KlFua-CaECo,2291490,2297730,being outside being at the wrong place  at the wrong time my mom and dad was  going crazy not knowing that I was
KlFua-CaECo,2297730,2304360,outside then knowing that you know I was  one of the kids laying out there with a  couple bucks shots all over his body was
KlFua-CaECo,2304360,2313540,very frightening and scared for them as  well as myself but it was a it was our
KlFua-CaECo,2313540,2318550,life you know it was a man of growing up  I mean no one felt like that no one
KlFua-CaECo,2318550,2324250,thought they'd have a life expectancy's  past 20 you know and then which was very  strange you know knowing that that was
KlFua-CaECo,2324250,2331840,the case but that was the mindset back  then because we had a lot of guys at a  young age time mainly because you know

KlFua-CaECo,3159060,3165640,hurt you and the way that that that that  this all happens is it all starts with
KlFua-CaECo,3165640,3171760,something super subtle that none of us  ever catch and that is with this habit
KlFua-CaECo,3171760,3180550,that all of us have that nobody's  talking about we all have a habit of  hesitating hmm we have an idea you're
KlFua-CaECo,3180550,3188230,sitting in a meeting you have this  incredible idea and instead of just you  know saying it you stop and you hesitate
KlFua-CaECo,3188230,3195520,now what none of us realize is that when  you hesitate just that moment that micro  moment that small hesitation it sends a
KlFua-CaECo,3195520,3202089,stress signal to your brain it wakes  your brain up and your brain all of a  sudden goes oh wait a minute wait wait  wait why is he hesitating he didn't

KlFua-CaECo,3218589,3226050,phenomenon where your brain magnifies  risk Y to pull you away from something  that it perceives to be a problem and so

KlFua-CaECo,3233710,3240560,has  those are decisions and what I do and  what's changed my life is waking up and
KlFua-CaECo,3240560,3245930,realizing that motivations garbage I'm  never going to feel like doing the  things that are tough for difficult or
KlFua-CaECo,3245930,3253610,uncertain or scary or new so I need to  stop leaving until I feel like it and  number two I am one decision away from a
KlFua-CaECo,3253610,3259760,totally different marriage a totally  different life a totally different job a  totally different income a totally
KlFua-CaECo,3259760,3266060,different relationship with my kids your  life comes down to your decisions if you

KlFua-CaECo,3280900,3287930,you do what you love doing and you do it  well then everything's just sort of fall  into place if we were to live forever we
KlFua-CaECo,3287930,3293480,could be slow full and lazy and  indifferent cuz we'd have forever to get
KlFua-CaECo,3293480,3300050,it straight but the fact that the clock  is ticking puts a sense of urgency on
KlFua-CaECo,3300050,3305960,each and every one of us and I know  you're saying well I'm 20 I don't need  to yeah you do you need to hear that
KlFua-CaECo,3305960,3315380,because you won't be twenty long so many  of us choose our path out of fear  disguised as practicality what we really
KlFua-CaECo,3315380,3322220,want seems impossibly out of reach and  ridiculous to expect so we never dare to  ask the universe for it I'm saying I'm

KlFua-CaECo,3437640,3444840,and sometimes wasting opportunities  along the way  in fact what makes you start to get
KlFua-CaECo,3444840,3451980,wiser as you get older is that as the  sands begin to fall more rapidly and you
KlFua-CaECo,3451980,3459180,begin to recognize that you're running  out of time you begin to mark certain  things off of your list I'm not gonna

KlFua-CaECo,3484200,3491040,was possible for him and so he made a  conservative choice instead he got a  safe job as an accountant and when I was

KlFua-CaECo,3602550,3610110,sleep just fine my history did not have  to become my future for whatever reason
KlFua-CaECo,3610110,3615880,most people their associations are to  avoid anything that's uncomfortable but
KlFua-CaECo,3615880,3621850,it's so illogical because when you look  at comfort and you look at success in
KlFua-CaECo,3621850,3627910,progress and the eventual the feelings  of accomplishment and of getting past
KlFua-CaECo,3627910,3634870,certain hurdles and in terms of like how  you feel about life a lot of those are  connected to discomfort like discomfort

KlFua-CaECo,3643060,3649840,what is but the establishment wants from  us I began to see the possibilities of
KlFua-CaECo,3649840,3655599,not being where I was I came to realize
KlFua-CaECo,3655599,3662140,it's that fear that's the worst of it  that's the real I will stand I will put
KlFua-CaECo,3662140,3667599,both of my feet in the ground and I will  stand for something because if I don't  stand for something I'll fall for
KlFua-CaECo,3667599,3673959,anything if you live your life just  acting constantly on the momentum of  other people's expectations of you
KlFua-CaECo,3673959,3680319,wanting to be liked by these other  people so get up get out of the real

KlFua-CaECo,3698640,3705970,you are going to incur an incur a lot of  disappointment a lot of failure a lot of
KlFua-CaECo,3705970,3711690,pain a lot of setbacks a lot of defeats
KlFua-CaECo,3714070,3719440,but in the process of doing that you  will discover some things about yourself
KlFua-CaECo,3719440,3724780,that you don't know right now what you  will realize is that you have greatness
KlFua-CaECo,3724780,3732970,within you what you'll realize is that  you're more powerful than you can ever  begin to imagine what you will realize
KlFua-CaECo,3732970,3740230,is that you're greater than your  circumstances that you don't have to go  through life being a victim was born in
KlFua-CaECo,3740230,3749500,Miami Florida the area called Liberty  City in an abandoned building on a  hardened Olien floor someone's opinion
KlFua-CaECo,3749500,3760630,of you does not have to become your  reality I mean if you want this if you
KlFua-CaECo,3760630,3768250,want bling bling if you want to buy the  Jets if you want to do work that's how  you get it how do you get money to do
KlFua-CaECo,3768250,3774670,what you love you don't right I lost a  load of money when I started doing what  I loved what you do is you position
KlFua-CaECo,3774670,3780340,yourself to succeed so for example if  you're doing something else at you and  you want to do this thing you love you
KlFua-CaECo,3780340,3785830,do it after hours you work 9:00 to 6:00  you get home you kiss the dog and you go
KlFua-CaECo,3785830,3791740,to town right I mean you start building  your equity in your brand and whatever  you're trying to accomplish after hours
KlFua-CaECo,3791740,3796620,you everybody has time stop watching  lost
KlFua-CaECo,3797060,3804590,the reason people aren't patient is they  value other people's opinions too much  you need to bet on your strengths and
KlFua-CaECo,3804590,3811310,don't give a about where you suck at  you're gonna weigh too many people in  this room we're gonna spend the next 30  40 years of their lives trying to check
KlFua-CaECo,3811310,3817760,the boxes other things that they're not  as good at and that you're gonna waste a  load of time and lose I highly recommend
KlFua-CaECo,3817760,3823280,auditing yourself or if you have no  empathy or EQ or self-awareness then
KlFua-CaECo,3823280,3829970,find somebody in your family or  friendship that does and let them tell  you who you are and once you believe  that either for yourself or someone else
KlFua-CaECo,3829970,3835520,told you go directly all chips all into  that because that is the only possible
KlFua-CaECo,3835520,3840950,way in my opinion watching from the  outside that is in place that is a very
KlFua-CaECo,3840950,3846170,highly likely way of over-indexing  because the truth is if you want to be
KlFua-CaECo,3846170,3851990,an anomaly you've got to act like I  think there's massive confusion around
KlFua-CaECo,3851990,3857600,entrepreneurship entrepreneurship sucks  I mean it's lonely it's high-risk I mean
KlFua-CaECo,3857600,3863840,I can't live without it but it's like a  bad boyfriend right a girlfriend right  like like it's there's a ton of bad days
KlFua-CaECo,3863840,3871540,being an entrepreneur  not to mention 98% of entrepreneurial  ventures are gonna fail so there's gonna  be a really bad day in your future
KlFua-CaECo,3871540,3877940,ability to adjust is the entire game  like I'm so proud that I changed my mind
KlFua-CaECo,3877940,3883370,every day my dad used to get so pissed  when I was building Wine Library he  would always be like he's like you would
KlFua-CaECo,3883370,3890390,say like three months ago you said Ricky  was gonna be the best employee and like  I changed my mind he fire him or or he's
KlFua-CaECo,3890390,3895460,like you said sparkling wine was  important now you just eliminated it  from the key spot I'm like I changed my
KlFua-CaECo,3895460,3900590,mind like my ability to only be  comfortable in massive chaos has been my
KlFua-CaECo,3900590,3906470,biggest asset as an entrepreneur like I  would never take a note like that scares  the piss out of me with these
KlFua-CaECo,3906470,3909040,we're doing right now
KlFua-CaECo,3912700,3919210,there should be some sort of friction  from somebody who's leading up in front  and sees everything and is driving a
KlFua-CaECo,3919210,3925450,company versus people that work in it  who are in the like they're different  like my job is to be like oh there's an
KlFua-CaECo,3925450,3931119,iceberg I'm gonna move this way and  everybody who's downstairs is like what  do you mean the water's been super clear
KlFua-CaECo,3931119,3936220,the whole time I'm like no no there's an  iceberg  but they're in the basement they're like
KlFua-CaECo,3936220,3941559,it's been such a nice ride like this has  been so smooth leaders need to
KlFua-CaECo,3941559,3947380,understand what's happening next there  are a million reasons why not but
KlFua-CaECo,3947380,3952450,there's one great reason why which is  you've just gotta persevere no matter
KlFua-CaECo,3952450,3958540,what it is it's just the way it is it's  hard being an entrepreneur it's hard  building a business everybody thinks
KlFua-CaECo,3958540,3965619,it's so easy what really pissed me off  in tech world was when Steve Jobs his
KlFua-CaECo,3965619,3971170,book came out when he was dying when it  was all about Steve three or four years  ago I literally watched a lot of my tech
KlFua-CaECo,3971170,3976619,startup friends start being like a to  their staff because Jobs was tough
KlFua-CaECo,3976619,3983799,everybody fell into the romance of like  I have this big vision and I'm gonna be  in like Steve right and I thought that
KlFua-CaECo,3983799,3989530,was really interesting for me to watch  that half decade like literally watching  people I know and then watching them act
KlFua-CaECo,3989530,3996609,differently because the status or the  icon of the moment and you see a lot of  that and so like that is probably the
KlFua-CaECo,3996609,4002460,energy I'm trying to bring to this class  today which is you can look at like how  people roll and like it's great to
KlFua-CaECo,4002460,4009990,admire and things of that nature but  it's so damn important to stick to like  your DNA right and like what you're good
KlFua-CaECo,4009990,4016709,at in a success  world please understand that success is
KlFua-CaECo,4016709,4022049,happiness not net dollars in we are
KlFua-CaECo,4022049,4028440,strongest when we strong we're just  being sold that we're not because
KlFua-CaECo,4028440,4036739,there's a lot of money people always say  that in Russia the biggest epidemic in
KlFua-CaECo,4036739,4042839,the world is people talking not doing  and especially now and people always do
KlFua-CaECo,4042839,4048239,that but now what social media does is  expose people it doesn't change people  all the hate in the system that's
KlFua-CaECo,4048239,4054209,exposing Twitter to make you evil you're  evil  you know and same with talking and not
KlFua-CaECo,4054209,4060650,doing Twitter and Instagram didn't make  you waste time and not do
KlFua-CaECo,4065890,4072349,in 2001 it snowed in New Jersey on
KlFua-CaECo,4072349,4078109,December 23rd which was one of the  busiest days of the year  typically December 23rd is the busiest
KlFua-CaECo,4078109,4084079,day of the year in a liquor store  and a woman called us we just started
KlFua-CaECo,4084079,4089719,shipping and her case of behringer White  Zinfandel wasn't delivered first of all
KlFua-CaECo,4089719,4095960,I appreciate the people that know what  behringer white sin is good job the  entire case by the way 15 pack the
KlFua-CaECo,4095960,4102859,entire 15 pack case cost $45 we're doing
KlFua-CaECo,4102859,4107939,"about $40,000 an hour in the store she  calls"
KlFua-CaECo,4107939,4113560,[Music]  I find out about it somehow it was  buzzing cuz I was up on the floor
KlFua-CaECo,4113560,4119920,selling I am the premier salesman on the  floor as you can imagine I find out  about it and we're debating what to do
KlFua-CaECo,4119920,4125650,she needs it for her Christmas dinner I  grab the case throw it in my car and
KlFua-CaECo,4125650,4131350,drive to Bergen County to deliver it  takes me two and a half hours to  complete the whole thing and the best
KlFua-CaECo,4131350,4139719,part was I delivered it all pumped with  myself and she said great and closed the  door  awesome everybody especially my dad who
KlFua-CaECo,4139719,4144940,was pissed that I left because all the  customers that came in asking for me or
KlFua-CaECo,4144940,4151109,that I could have sold everybody who's  baffled I can't tell you what the ROI of
KlFua-CaECo,4151109,4159429,driving through the snow in my car to  deliver a case of $45 pink to a woman
KlFua-CaECo,4159429,4164560,that look like yo to us but I can tell  you this over the next two the three
KlFua-CaECo,4164560,4173080,years that story became the foundation  of how we treated every single bus  it became our competitive edge and those
KlFua-CaECo,4173080,4180818,are the things that matter to me you
KlFua-CaECo,4180818,4187859,need to do you like some plenty of  people that make a lot more money than  me and one bigger to take notes the key
KlFua-CaECo,4187859,4194230,the key though the key is way too many  people are doing like here's a good one
KlFua-CaECo,4194230,4201730,you know what really pissed me off  I'm completely driven by like happiness  and like I'm crippled by like chaos like
KlFua-CaECo,4201730,4207699,I think I've fired four most talented  smartest people that have worked for me  because if you don't know how to play  with the other boys and girls you're out
KlFua-CaECo,4207699,4213520,because I suffocate under you know  conflict and negativity and like
KlFua-CaECo,4213520,4221679,nobody's better than me so you got to go  building a business is hard and you know
KlFua-CaECo,4221679,4228730,what makes it really hard  everything that happens every day of  every moment so you can pick time you
KlFua-CaECo,4228730,4234910,can pick money as the one or two things  that you think stopped you from winning  your game but the truth is there's a
KlFua-CaECo,4234910,4243310,million reasons 99 percent of businesses  go out of business for a reason and that  reason is it's hard and so if you're
KlFua-CaECo,4243310,4249400,watching this show I've got a sense of  who you are and you need to start  creating layers and layers and layers
KlFua-CaECo,4249400,4257620,and layers of skin to be able to get  through I'm a humungous believer that
KlFua-CaECo,4257620,4263140,ideas are and that executions the game  right we've all got ideas everybody's
KlFua-CaECo,4263140,4269440,got ideas  do you weave the ideas we all have here  we can probably sit here for the next  two hours draw them all out record them
KlFua-CaECo,4269440,4276460,and predict the next 78 great startups  over the next nine years and so I think
KlFua-CaECo,4276460,4282179,the thing that is another theme in  entrepreneurship is there is a way
KlFua-CaECo,4282179,4287900,too much fodder brought to the idea  goober was magic cab three years earlier
KlFua-CaECo,4287900,4293370,there's not an idea Euler existed it's  got magic but the guys that executed
KlFua-CaECo,4293370,4300060,sucked so they lost so I think you know  if there's any level of romance left in
KlFua-CaECo,4300060,4305969,this room about your idea  I'd like to suffocate it because I think  the actual situation is what you
KlFua-CaECo,4305969,4312330,actually do with it if you do anything  because of this key note there's only
KlFua-CaECo,4312330,4318659,one thing I ask you to do because as any  as I got I'm a practical here's what I  want from you when you go home look
KlFua-CaECo,4318659,4324870,yourself in the mirror and audit  everything you and your business do I  promise you that if you audit from top
KlFua-CaECo,4324870,4330060,to bottom of expenses and effort and  time and energy and payroll and all that
KlFua-CaECo,4330060,4336030,if you audit all of it even the best of  us even the invents which is the company  that bought Budweiser they built their
KlFua-CaECo,4336030,4342090,whole business unlike printing on both  sides and favorite all that work even  the most efficient ones of us are doing
KlFua-CaECo,4342090,4348960,20% dumber  if you take that 8% that 13% that 16% of
KlFua-CaECo,4348960,4354900,dump that you're doing paying that  person that's not bringing any cultural  value to your business having that
KlFua-CaECo,4354900,4362090,contract that you've just been in am you  just renew because  busiest whatever you're doing if you  take any piece that percentage and you
KlFua-CaECo,4362090,4367490,apply it to giving up about your  customer it will be better for your  business going forward because for the
KlFua-CaECo,4367490,4373340,first time since we all lived in small  towns where your reputation was the  complete backbone of how you did
KlFua-CaECo,4373340,4380480,business for the first time because  technology is putting us back together  in a small town for the first time being
KlFua-CaECo,4380480,4386410,good and caring and following up matters
KlFua-CaECo,4389700,4395670,nor let have to be your life stop you  are the master of your own mind create
KlFua-CaECo,4395670,4403170,that masterpiece be proud yourself very  integral we've kind of lost touch with
KlFua-CaECo,4403170,4409880,the cultural narratives around death  that gave it some meanings so now when  it happens it's just this absurd scary
KlFua-CaECo,4409880,4416130,thing that we don't know what to do with  the only narrative we have that we have  absorbed I guess is that of the brave
KlFua-CaECo,4416130,4424610,battle that someone's fighting if you're  going to try go all the way otherwise
KlFua-CaECo,4424610,4430170,don't even start that this is this is  when we can bring out if we have the
KlFua-CaECo,4430170,4436620,opportunity to bring our stories to some  kind of ending what your film will read  a book that final scene makes sense of
KlFua-CaECo,4436620,4441780,everything that's happened before this  doesn't happen in life author of our
KlFua-CaECo,4441780,4450390,stories more than at any point before  death if you are going to try go all the
KlFua-CaECo,4450390,4462469,way this could mean losing girlfriends  wives relatives jobs and maybe your mind
KlFua-CaECo,4462770,4469880,main characters are our loved ones or  the doctors or people making all these  decisions and we kind of get sidelined
KlFua-CaECo,4470360,4475560,go all the way it could mean not eating
KlFua-CaECo,4475560,4481010,for three or four days it could mean  freezing an apartment
KlFua-CaECo,4481010,4491400,it could mean jail it could mean  division mockery isolation isolation is
KlFua-CaECo,4491400,4497790,the gift it's not okay for you to be  weak loser it's not okay and the reason
KlFua-CaECo,4497790,4505370,it's not okay is because you could be  way more than that and it's a crime an  ethical crime for you to allow all that
KlFua-CaECo,4505370,4511500,necessary potential to go to waste  it hurts you it hurts your family hurts
KlFua-CaECo,4511500,4519139,the world really really it does  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,4522899,4528659,all the others are a test of your  endurance of how much you really want to
KlFua-CaECo,4528659,4539399,do it and you'll do it despite rejection  and the worst odds when I was 15 years
KlFua-CaECo,4539399,4544860,old I had a very important person in my  life come to me and say who's your hero  and I said I don't know I gotta think  about that give me a couple of weeks I
KlFua-CaECo,4544860,4552719,come back two weeks later this person  comes up says you hero I said I thought  about it you know who it is I said it's  me in 10 years so I turned 25 10 years
KlFua-CaECo,4552719,4559110,later that same person comes Mingo so  are you a hero and I was like not even  close no no no she said why I said
KlFua-CaECo,4559110,4564869,because my heroes meet at 35 so you see  every day every week every month and  every year of my life my heroes always
KlFua-CaECo,4564869,4570479,ten years away I'm never gonna be a hero  I'm not gonna attain that I know I'm not  that's just fine with me because that
KlFua-CaECo,4570479,4574909,keeps me with somebody to keep on chase
KlFua-CaECo,4577550,4583170,only person I can really work  accountable with myself the second I  stop where people and blame myself I
KlFua-CaECo,4583170,4590658,change it will be better than anything  else you can imagine
KlFua-CaECo,4590719,4600719,if you're going to try go all the way  there is no other feeling like that you
KlFua-CaECo,4600719,4606980,will be alone with the gods  and the nights will flame with fire

KlFua-CaECo,4698330,4705380,your life incrementally by eliminating  those things that are self-evidently  making you bitter and miserable but you
KlFua-CaECo,4705380,4712700,have to decide that that's what you want  you are willing to burn off that  Deadwood to sacrifice that bitterness
KlFua-CaECo,4712700,4717830,and that unhappiness even though you may  feel but you're justified in in in in
KlFua-CaECo,4717830,4723590,harboring it you may even be justified  in harboring it because people have very  hard lives and sometimes they're very
KlFua-CaECo,4723590,4730190,badly mistreated but you need to think  it's okay if things improve and it would
KlFua-CaECo,4730190,4738580,be worthwhile for me to start to abandon  those things that I'm doing that I know  to be harmful to myself

KlFua-CaECo,5016220,5023550,to be totally honest that never really  matters to me I'm not great I just work  really hard I just hang on
KlFua-CaECo,5023550,5029309,[Music]
KlFua-CaECo,5029309,5035409,something I wanted to mention here is I  hear people talking about how they have
KlFua-CaECo,5035409,5041610,a hard time with consistency and  sometimes they have a hard time with  motivation a good way to handle
KlFua-CaECo,5041610,5047980,motivation is to eliminate it as a  factor sometimes the greatest decision
KlFua-CaECo,5047980,5054550,you can make is no decision sometimes  the easiest thing to do when you  struggle with something is to abstain
KlFua-CaECo,5054550,5060610,from it you have a drug addiction you  have a sex addiction you have a food
KlFua-CaECo,5060610,5069039,addiction fasting not allowing yourself  to make any choices eliminates a lot of
KlFua-CaECo,5069039,5074760,the confusion and struggle  and poor decision-making skills that you
KlFua-CaECo,5074760,5085350,tend to make each and every day with  your food because you're fatigued you're  stressed and so on the same thing is
KlFua-CaECo,5085350,5091080,true with motivation if we just don't  really worry about how motivated we are
KlFua-CaECo,5091080,5096090,and we just go and do then that
KlFua-CaECo,5096090,5102750,that kind of settles that you're already  in it you're already on it you're  already after it you're already going
KlFua-CaECo,5102750,5109920,right now how do how do you get someone  to do that that's the tough part but it
KlFua-CaECo,5109920,5116150,ain't that hard because I got advices  for you here's what I would do here's  what I would suggest
KlFua-CaECo,5116909,5123309,things need to have a very strong you  always need a strong foundation if you
KlFua-CaECo,5123309,5128900,have a strong foundation that's always  something you can pivot back off of  again  if you don't have something strong you
KlFua-CaECo,5128900,5135170,got something wobbly it's not gonna it's  not gonna really work in a long term  because work in the short term which is
KlFua-CaECo,5135170,5141860,cool so you get your momentum towards  your goals but we need stuff that's  gonna really work in a long term and
KlFua-CaECo,5141860,5149870,what's gonna work in a long term is to  just have a schedule try to have a
KlFua-CaECo,5149870,5157250,schedule even if you don't feel like  that you're not let's just say you don't  feel like you're an organized person let
KlFua-CaECo,5157250,5162679,me just share something with you guys  about that I don't feel like I'm an
KlFua-CaECo,5162679,5170690,organized person but I'm a lot more  organized today and I've ever been in my  life and some people may identify me as
KlFua-CaECo,5170690,5176090,not being very organized but if you had  to do the [ __ ] that I did in a day your
KlFua-CaECo,5176090,5179948,mother and head would be spinning too
KlFua-CaECo,5181140,5186300,and look I'm not complaining this is  stuff that I choose to do right
KlFua-CaECo,5186300,5192670,changing your dialogue is really  important and changing the message you  give yourself so if you don't feel like
KlFua-CaECo,5192670,5198569,you're an organized person that's okay  it's okay to identify that as a weakness  but that doesn't mean that you can
KlFua-CaECo,5198569,5203879,and that doesn't mean that we can't get  on a schedule and that doesn't mean that  we can't get on point and that doesn't
KlFua-CaECo,5203879,5210929,mean we can't build consistency because  consistency will knock the [ __ ] out of  motivation every time he will knock the
KlFua-CaECo,5210929,5216419,[ __ ] outta motivation every time if we  can build consistency we ain't gotta  worry about how fired up we are to go do
KlFua-CaECo,5216419,5222569,something you could be in a good mood  you could be in a bad mood you could be  in a sad mood you could be in a [ __ ]
KlFua-CaECo,5222569,5233220,mood you can find out the worst thing  and you will just shrug it off and delay  this is what I'm doing  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,5235510,5240880,that's the way I handle my workouts as I  just schedule them we're doing this and
KlFua-CaECo,5240880,5248380,like they're not scheduled like weeks  out you know for some of you you may  want to try to you know have a specific
KlFua-CaECo,5248380,5255670,routine I don't really love routine but  I do flourish on it  I'll admit that and I think that's
KlFua-CaECo,5255670,5262330,probably true with everybody everyone  probably you know there's a reason why  the military works the way that it does
KlFua-CaECo,5262330,5268720,why they're able to produce leaders the  way that they are because there's a  routine involved and people respond
KlFua-CaECo,5268720,5274120,really well to routine look at how  broken a lot of the people are that go  into the military and look how strong
KlFua-CaECo,5274120,5279580,they are sometimes when they come out  and we all admire that right what did
KlFua-CaECo,5279580,5286570,they do that's special they exercised  really hard right they got on a schedule
KlFua-CaECo,5286570,5293489,and we're all we're all you know amazed  at the discipline  and like man how do they stay so
KlFua-CaECo,5293489,5299250,motivated thought there's no motivation  it's a schedule it's a routine we're
KlFua-CaECo,5299250,5305280,doing this and then we're doing that I  have never experienced military training
KlFua-CaECo,5305280,5310380,I have never experienced what it would  be like but I can only imagine everybody
KlFua-CaECo,5310380,5317190,kind of knows what their schedule is if  you're having a hard time with  consistency with your training write
KlFua-CaECo,5317190,5325800,down when you want to train the day  before 24 hours ahead of time so
KlFua-CaECo,5325800,5331470,whenever you're done with your last  training session whenever you're done
KlFua-CaECo,5331470,5338670,with your last training session if you  if you finish a training session at 4:00  p.m. and you're like you know I really  love to train to morrow morning I love

KlFua-CaECo,5368610,5373860,there's way worse things to cry about in  this world than going in and doing a  hard training session so I'm not trying
KlFua-CaECo,5373860,5378870,to be a [ __ ] about it  I'm not trying to be a baby about it I'm  very grateful for the life that I have
KlFua-CaECo,5378870,5384480,and I'm very grateful that we have the  freedom in this country where I can go I

KlFua-CaECo,5522539,5527999,always looking for their pre-workout to  do something great for them and what  about the pre-workout that happens on
KlFua-CaECo,5527999,5533639,your own the food that you ingest the  planning that you do think about how
KlFua-CaECo,5533639,5538829,empowering this is you know I think  everyone's always just waiting for  somebody to do something for them I
KlFua-CaECo,5538829,5544079,think a lot of people are waiting and  I'm guilty this is the only reason why
KlFua-CaECo,5544079,5551669,I'm ever able to speak on any of this  stuff so please don't ever think that  I'm some pompous [ __ ] I only know how
KlFua-CaECo,5551669,5559530,to speak on things because I am a  failure I am the biggest failure you'll  ever meet  I have messed up many times my mindset
KlFua-CaECo,5559530,5564959,has been broken and poor and I've made  bad decisions I've done bad things too
KlFua-CaECo,5564959,5571190,bad to people  I'm never gonna claim that he's special  but I am proud I'm proud of the things
KlFua-CaECo,5571190,5577910,that I've worked on I'm proud of the  things that I've worked towards think
KlFua-CaECo,5577910,5584960,about how empowering this is though  right I could say something to you right  all right we could meet and I can say
KlFua-CaECo,5584960,5590000,hey man dude  you look like you look like you can lift
KlFua-CaECo,5590000,5595520,a house you know and maybe that uplifts  you and you get excited because you've  been training really hard for a long
KlFua-CaECo,5595520,5600590,time right sometimes things like that  they last a while and sometimes from the
KlFua-CaECo,5600590,5608330,right person and then deciding to me  still this day I get a compliment from  somebody I admire it feels great you
KlFua-CaECo,5608330,5614360,know it feels great when somebody tells  you you look dirty it's a good feeling  right somebody says wow I can't believe
KlFua-CaECo,5614360,5620030,you looks like you've lost about 20  pounds you've been losing weight you  know I can actually I did I lost about
KlFua-CaECo,5620030,5625940,18 pounds things are going really good  I'm feeling really good or a friend of  mine shared with me more recently he
KlFua-CaECo,5625940,5632880,thought he grew up thinking he was ugly  what a horrible thing to do right there
KlFua-CaECo,5632880,5641760,horrible thing to put on yourself he  thought he was ugly godlike vanity  issues and one day a girl said hey mean
KlFua-CaECo,5641760,5648330,a bunch of my friends think you look  like so-and-so it's a famous actor and I  said you you think you're really cute
KlFua-CaECo,5648330,5653429,and he was floored by that and he was  just so excited by that that helped
KlFua-CaECo,5653429,5658440,build momentum really for the rest of  his life  what changed though when that person
KlFua-CaECo,5658440,5665760,said that what changed nothing changed  nothing changed right like everything
KlFua-CaECo,5665760,5670800,changed because he made changes because  his he that's dialogue in his head his
KlFua-CaECo,5670800,5676920,mindset shifted he couldn't believe that  somebody that somebody said that to him
KlFua-CaECo,5676920,5682770,but isn't that crazy like nothing  actually changed nothing physical change
KlFua-CaECo,5682770,5689040,he didn't do anything different it's  it's your own inner speaking to yourself
KlFua-CaECo,5689040,5694650,the way that you treat yourself and then  we are really rude and disgusting to
KlFua-CaECo,5694650,5700350,ourselves we say a lot of mean [ __ ] to  ourselves we put ourselves down a lot
KlFua-CaECo,5700350,5706290,which I actually think put yourself down  here and then it's actually effective  telling yourself you're too fat telling
KlFua-CaECo,5706290,5711480,yourself you're too skinny telling  yourself that you want to make you  telling yourself things that you have
KlFua-CaECo,5711480,5717780,control over and that you're gonna do  something about it  I think that's healthy but I always also
KlFua-CaECo,5717780,5723600,say never kick the down opponent never  kick a downed opponent someone's down
KlFua-CaECo,5723600,5730490,you never kick  let's say you have somebody that's out
KlFua-CaECo,5730490,5738430,of shape so you have somebody that can  only perform they can only do one pushup
KlFua-CaECo,5738430,5743480,they make a decision in one day they say  you know what let themselves in the
KlFua-CaECo,5743480,5749960,mirror they say self you know what you  add a shape and you really haven't let's
KlFua-CaECo,5749960,5757070,not feel bad about it because if we're  being honest about it haven't done  anything about it right he would be like
KlFua-CaECo,5757070,5762290,if I went to go play baseball one day  and I struck out a bunch of times that  I'm really really frustrated I struck
KlFua-CaECo,5762290,5768019,out well when's the last time I played  baseball how much have I been working on  that
KlFua-CaECo,5768019,5774559,I haven't been working on it so I  shouldn't be frustrated about it if you
KlFua-CaECo,5774559,5780559,really haven't been working on trying to  be less satirist then you shouldn't be
KlFua-CaECo,5780559,5786079,sad about being fat I'm not saying you  should be proud about it either but you
KlFua-CaECo,5786079,5791829,shouldn't be sad about it you should  plan a an attack about it
KlFua-CaECo,5792670,5799420,if a person is out of shape and they  make a decision to go to the gym and  they can only do one pushup and then a
KlFua-CaECo,5799420,5804460,couple a little you know couple days go  by they hit the gym again boom I hit the
KlFua-CaECo,5804460,5810220,gym again I hit the gym again like man I  had to try  I really suck at those push-ups now they
KlFua-CaECo,5810220,5815560,can do two push-ups now they can do  three push-ups now they can do five
KlFua-CaECo,5815560,5820930,push-ups that'll be the most empowering  thing that probably ever happens to some
KlFua-CaECo,5820930,5826120,people because you want to know why  because some people never get one pat on
KlFua-CaECo,5826120,5831880,the back their entire life it's nice to  have someone say that you're great or  whatever I would like to be totally
KlFua-CaECo,5831880,5839200,honest that never really matters to me I  always think it's kind of weird  you're great well I'm not what am i
KlFua-CaECo,5839200,5847770,great like that's that's a weird thing  to say I'm not great I just work really  hard I just hang on I I don't give up
KlFua-CaECo,5847770,5853480,and a lot of it has to do with my  upbringing I say this every day I have
KlFua-CaECo,5853480,5858640,two awesome parents I have an awesome  brother I grew up with two awesome
KlFua-CaECo,5858640,5866040,brothers  one died my oldest brother he died he  you know he was addicted to drugs he was
KlFua-CaECo,5866040,5871530,addicted to alcohol he was addicted to  all kinds of crazy stuff but I think the  most dangerous thing that he was
KlFua-CaECo,5871530,5878100,addicted to is addicted to all the wrong  [ __ ] he couldn't figure out a way to be  happy even though he was famous even
KlFua-CaECo,5878100,5883590,though he was a professional wrestler he  got in the ring with the Undertaker with
KlFua-CaECo,5883590,5890470,Bret Hart  he got in the ring with just about every  single top level guy from that era you
KlFua-CaECo,5890470,5895990,could think of he was division one  football player he did all kinds of cool  stuff but he couldn't find the thing
KlFua-CaECo,5895990,5901739,that allowed so many  you didn't find that inner peace because
KlFua-CaECo,5901739,5908040,he couldn't earn self-respect because he  knew he was making mistakes and he felt
KlFua-CaECo,5908040,5914969,like he had no control over a lot of  them you're not alone and feeling that  way there's millions of people that feel
KlFua-CaECo,5914969,5920370,that way  and I cannot think of one other way that  you can fix that without going in the
KlFua-CaECo,5920370,5927420,gym and lifting some weights because  you're not gonna get that in a boardroom  you have to get that at work you're not
KlFua-CaECo,5927420,5934949,gonna get that from selling insurance  you're not gonna get that from selling  advertising you're not gonna get that
KlFua-CaECo,5934949,5942420,from Instagram you're not gonna get that  from Facebook you're not gonna get that  from social media period you're not
KlFua-CaECo,5942420,5948090,gonna get that from YouTube you need in  real life hugs and even in real life
KlFua-CaECo,5948090,5957949,smooches and in real life hands being  put together for you and for some of you
KlFua-CaECo,5957949,5964560,that don't feel like you have got one  person in your corner that doesn't [ __ ]  for you we're almost always all
KlFua-CaECo,5964560,5971159,fortunate to have like one person  there's always like one mentor in there  I'm a believer a believer that everyone
KlFua-CaECo,5971159,5976650,ends up with one even when they have the  people that they want to love them don't
KlFua-CaECo,5976650,5983070,love them they end up in somebody's  hands that do love them enough so you  got that one person so you got that one
KlFua-CaECo,5983070,5988730,reason to kind of hang on  hang on for yourself hang on for at  least that one person you can make
KlFua-CaECo,5988730,5995180,yourself proud and by making yourself  proud it'll be the most powerful thing  that you ever do you're not trying to
KlFua-CaECo,5995180,6001900,compare yourself to other people you can  try and compare yourself to your former  self and not comparing yourself to where
KlFua-CaECo,6001900,6008050,people are right now it's this is you  versus you as Elliott Holt says the war
KlFua-CaECo,6008050,6013090,has begun  it certainly has and it's a war against
KlFua-CaECo,6013090,6019150,yourself every single day because if we  can gain self respect and we can earn
KlFua-CaECo,6019150,6024190,self respect self-respect has to be  earned  it's not something that's ever gonna be
KlFua-CaECo,6024190,6030790,given out if you go to the gym and when  you start it on day one you can only do  one pushup and now you can do 10 you
KlFua-CaECo,6030790,6038110,earn that and that's not anything that  could be outsourced it can't be handed  to you I can't be purchased it can't be
KlFua-CaECo,6038110,6044740,bought I mean dreams are dreams but  goals are different goals are things  that you you know are gonna happen that
KlFua-CaECo,6044740,6051040,you know you're capable of and you want  to know what there's no reason to be  overly concerned or worried about them
KlFua-CaECo,6051040,6056639,because they're gonna happen because  everything that you need is inside of  you already to get you there
KlFua-CaECo,6056639,6062070,you're already there and some of the  things you've accomplished maybe you're  not that proud of some of them but I bet
KlFua-CaECo,6062070,6068489,you there's a bunch of stuff that you  are pretty proud of lean on your  strengths everyone's always talking  about working on your weaknesses what
KlFua-CaECo,6068489,6077040,about working on your strengths and  amplifying those doubling and tripling  down on those and when you are able to
KlFua-CaECo,6077040,6082199,build momentum  you're gonna recognize this you're gonna  recognize and understand that people
KlFua-CaECo,6082199,6087570,that are put in places to run things  your be in charge of things or they're  not any smarter than you they're not any
KlFua-CaECo,6087570,6093090,different than you they're probably  dumber than you the only way to grow is
KlFua-CaECo,6093090,6098159,the go through [ __ ] that's hard and [ __ ]  that's difficult and you're gonna go
KlFua-CaECo,6098159,6103440,through hard [ __ ] anyway in your day to  day you're gonna go through tough [ __ ]
KlFua-CaECo,6103440,6109530,in your day day to day stuff anyway  regardless of what you do or how you do  it there's gonna be good things there's
KlFua-CaECo,6109530,6114080,gonna be bad thing you're gonna go  through all kinds of stuff in your life
KlFua-CaECo,6148690,6158490,it's very simple this is what I believe  and I'm willing to die for it period
KlFua-CaECo,6158490,6165250,it's that simple you can't be scared to
KlFua-CaECo,6165250,6173490,die for the truth the truth is the only  thing that's ever going to be constant
KlFua-CaECo,6173490,6178710,the only thing that I see that is
KlFua-CaECo,6178710,6186160,distinctly different about me is I'm not  afraid to die on a treadmill you might
KlFua-CaECo,6186160,6193390,have more talent than me  you might be smarter than me but if we  get on the treadmill together there's
KlFua-CaECo,6193390,6201210,two things you're getting off first or  I'm gonna die it's really that simple
KlFua-CaECo,6201270,6208260,you're not going to outwork me it's a  it's a very is such a simple basic
KlFua-CaECo,6208260,6216290,concept  the guy who was willing to hustle the
KlFua-CaECo,6216290,6222410,most is gonna be the guy that just gets  that loose ball you know he got the okay
KlFua-CaECo,6222410,6229820,he got to oh god he's puzzling grabbed  out when I was gonna be out of bounds  but he said back in it's like the
KlFua-CaECo,6229820,6236000,commodity that I see the majority of  people who aren't getting the places
KlFua-CaECo,6236000,6241460,they want or aren't achieving the things  that they want in this business is
KlFua-CaECo,6241460,6246560,strictly based on hustle it's strictly  based on being out work is strictly
KlFua-CaECo,6246560,6252050,based on missing crucial opportunities I  say all the time if you stay ready you
KlFua-CaECo,6252050,6258080,ain't gotta get ready  greatness is not this
KlFua-CaECo,6258080,6263690,[Music]  wonderful esoteric illusive  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,6263690,6271020,godlike feature that only the special  among us will ever taste
KlFua-CaECo,6271020,6277370,you know it's something that truly  exists in all of us
KlFua-CaECo,6278070,6285070,what to do good I want the world to be  better because I was here want my life I
KlFua-CaECo,6285070,6291309,want my my work my family I wanted to  mean something and it's like it has if
KlFua-CaECo,6291309,6296559,if you are not making someone else's  life better then you're wasting your
KlFua-CaECo,6296559,6302320,time you know like that your life will  become better by making other lives
KlFua-CaECo,6302320,6309500,better  [Music]  the first step before anybody else in
KlFua-CaECo,6309500,6315680,the world believes it is you have to  believe there's no reason to have a plan  because it distracts from plan a
KlFua-CaECo,6315680,6320790,[Music]  I realized that we needed to have the
KlFua-CaECo,6320790,6326159,level of success that I want to have is  difficult to spread it out and do
KlFua-CaECo,6326159,6332429,multiple things it takes such a  desperate obsessive focus it really
KlFua-CaECo,6332429,6344579,gotta focus with all your fiber and all  your heart all your creativity I've
KlFua-CaECo,6344579,6352489,never really viewed myself as  particularly talented where I excel is
KlFua-CaECo,6352730,6359520,ridiculous sickening work ethic you know  while the other guys sleeping I'm
KlFua-CaECo,6359520,6364820,working what other guys eaten work
KlFua-CaECo,6365130,6372719,the road to success is through  commitment and through the strength to
KlFua-CaECo,6372719,6378179,drive through that commitment when it  gets hard and it is going to get hard  and you're gonna want to quit sometimes
KlFua-CaECo,6378179,6387270,but it'll be colored by who you are and  more who you want to be being realistic
KlFua-CaECo,6387270,6393050,is the most commonly traveled road to  mediocrity why would you be realistic
KlFua-CaECo,6393050,6399060,what's the point of being realistic I'm  gonna do it it's done it's already done  the second I decide it's done it's
KlFua-CaECo,6399060,6406710,already done so now we just gotta wait  for y'all to see I'm motivated by fear
KlFua-CaECo,6406710,6412530,you know here of what and fear of fear I
KlFua-CaECo,6412530,6420150,hate being scared to do something and I  think what developed in my in my early
KlFua-CaECo,6420150,6429500,days was the attitude that I started  attacking things that I was scared
KlFua-CaECo,6429960,6436650,I don't want to be an icon I want to be
KlFua-CaECo,6436650,6443190,an idea you know I want to represent an  idea i want to represent possibilities I
KlFua-CaECo,6443190,6449630,want to represent magic right that  you're in a universe in two plus two
KlFua-CaECo,6449630,6454860,equals four two plus the only equals  four if you accept it two plus two
KlFua-CaECo,6454860,6460620,equals four two plus two is gonna be  what I wanted to do you know and there's
KlFua-CaECo,6460620,6467580,that there's a but there's that there's  a redemptive power that making a choice
KlFua-CaECo,6467580,6474240,hat you know rather than feeling like  you're at effect to all the things that
KlFua-CaECo,6474240,6481860,are happening make a choice like you  just decide what is gonna be who you're
KlFua-CaECo,6481860,6487440,gonna be how you're gonna do it just  decide and then from that point the
KlFua-CaECo,6487440,6493140,universe is gonna get out your way this  light is water it wants to it wants to  move and go around stuff you know
KlFua-CaECo,6493140,6499500,suffering from need I want to represent  possibilities I'm gonna represent the
KlFua-CaECo,6499500,6509360,idea that  really can't make what you want there's
KlFua-CaECo,6509360,6515750,a necessity to make a difference I feel  very strongly that we are who we choose
KlFua-CaECo,6515750,6522490,to be the child my parents always told  me you could be whatever you want to be  you could do whatever you want to do and
KlFua-CaECo,6522490,6528200,you know that that office that position  of the highest office in the face of the
KlFua-CaECo,6528200,6534050,earth it was something I heard my  parents saying it but I didn't totally
KlFua-CaECo,6534050,6539780,believe it yet I went out in the world  and I carried myself and I held my head  high and I stood there and I look people
KlFua-CaECo,6539780,6547130,in their eyes and I talked to people as  if I was deserving of everything that  this planet has to offer this is one
KlFua-CaECo,6547130,6555680,year he wanted a new the front of his
KlFua-CaECo,6555680,6563150,shops he tore down probably about 16  feet high and probably about 30 feet
KlFua-CaECo,6563150,6570260,long he just completely turned the wall  down and my brother had been a six-foot  hole it would mix in the concrete by him
KlFua-CaECo,6570260,6574960,we were building this wall for a year
KlFua-CaECo,6577160,6582900,it was just myself and my little brother  and I remember standing back looking at
KlFua-CaECo,6582900,6590190,that wall there's going to be a holder  for after the half later we laid the the
KlFua-CaECo,6590190,6596590,final breath and if I buy this feedback  and look at me and my brother said it  all John never tell
KlFua-CaECo,6596590,6603639,I learned very young you you don't try
KlFua-CaECo,6603639,6610570,to build a wall you don't set out to  build a wall you don't say how many  think though the biggest baddest
KlFua-CaECo,6610570,6617610,greatest wall that's ever been built you  know start there  you say I'm gonna lay this brick as
KlFua-CaECo,6617610,6623080,perfectly as a brick can be laid there  will not be one brick on the face of the
KlFua-CaECo,6623080,6629409,earth as will be laid better than this  brick then I'm gonna lay in this next  ten minutes and you do that every single
KlFua-CaECo,6629409,6635469,day soon you have a wall and I think  psychologically the advantage that that
KlFua-CaECo,6635469,6640599,gives me over over a lot of people that  come have been in competition with in
KlFua-CaECo,6640599,6646390,different situations is it's difficult  to take the first step look
KlFua-CaECo,6646390,6651460,the task the task is never huge day we
KlFua-CaECo,6651460,6657790,didn't grow up with the sense that where  we were was where we were gonna be and
KlFua-CaECo,6657790,6664240,we grew up with the sense then where we  were almost didn't matter because it'll
KlFua-CaECo,6664240,6672220,be coming we were becoming something  great the greatest thing in my my career
KlFua-CaECo,6672220,6678700,has been the constant commitment to  putting something in the world of value
KlFua-CaECo,6678700,6684610,not putting something in the world that  makes me look hot you know though I
KlFua-CaECo,6684610,6690700,think as long as you can stay focused on  delivering your art and delivering  yourself and delivering your energy and
KlFua-CaECo,6690700,6696030,delivering your ideas for the world to  be better
KlFua-CaECo,6696030,6706300,the difference between depression and  joy right and I think it's purpose right
KlFua-CaECo,6706300,6711619,it's like when you wake up in the  morning
KlFua-CaECo,6711619,6716750,your life means something to somebody  other than you that you have a purpose
KlFua-CaECo,6716750,6722239,if you don't go do the things that  you're going to do people's lives will
KlFua-CaECo,6722239,6728179,suffer and I think that that kind of  purpose that like to live in service not
KlFua-CaECo,6728179,6733219,to you but to live in service to  humanity to live in service to your
KlFua-CaECo,6733219,6741590,family to live in service to your church  to your city to your country to the  world living in service is that I feel
KlFua-CaECo,6741590,6749659,like that is the purest form of Jordan  the separation of talent and skill is
KlFua-CaECo,6749659,6755179,one of the the the greatest  misunderstood concepts for people who
KlFua-CaECo,6755179,6761300,are trying to excel who have dreams that  want to do things talent you have  naturally skill is only developed by
KlFua-CaECo,6761300,6768830,hours and hours and hours of beating on  your craft he who says he can and he who
KlFua-CaECo,6768830,6773929,says he can't are both usually right and  I want you to keep in your heart just
KlFua-CaECo,6773929,6776560,know that you can
KlFua-CaECo,6783590,6789179,now somebody once said you can take all  the money in the world out of the hands  of everybody out of all the wealthy
KlFua-CaECo,6789179,6794369,people in the world who are really  successful given to other people it  wouldn't take too long those people have  it back in their hands it's not because
KlFua-CaECo,6794369,6800429,they're manipular that's cuz they have a  standard the reason people don't put  themselves in a position to fail the
KlFua-CaECo,6800429,6807889,reason people aren't patient is they  value other people's opinions too much  you have to monitor your self-talk
KlFua-CaECo,6807889,6814290,monitor your self-talk if you go around  keep to tell people oh I have a horrible  memory I'm not smart enough I'm getting
KlFua-CaECo,6814290,6821849,too old fill in the blank take those  three magic words and live them raise  your standard if you fight for your
KlFua-CaECo,6821849,6827159,limitations you get to keep them you  gotta be willing to do it
KlFua-CaECo,6827159,6834929,afraid see you might be waiting for the  fear to stop should leap leap afraid you
KlFua-CaECo,6834929,6841380,chose to withdraw because you were  afraid we're actually tougher than you  think you never knew that and maybe you
KlFua-CaECo,6841380,6846900,didn't want to take on the  responsibility people are rewarded in
KlFua-CaECo,6846900,6852599,public for what they've practiced for  years in private Farren guard to your  mind because your mind is always
KlFua-CaECo,6852599,6857849,eavesdropping on your self-talk your  mind is always eavesdropping on your
KlFua-CaECo,6857849,6863040,self-talk either die leaping then on the  edge figuring out how to get the courage
KlFua-CaECo,6863040,6869489,to leave okay I'm gonna go make this  happen I'm gonna go make this much money  I'm gonna transform my kids I'm gonna
KlFua-CaECo,6869489,6875219,create the ultimate relationship of my  life I'm gonna transform my body  whatever it is and then you don't have
KlFua-CaECo,6875219,6880590,strong enough reasons and you don't lose  use it you don't follow through it's  because you didn't back up your
KlFua-CaECo,6880590,6887880,standards with what makes those  standards real and that's rituals you  constantly remind yourself after every
KlFua-CaECo,6887880,6894570,defeat after every setback every time  you get knocked down I've got a saying  if life knocks you down try and land on
KlFua-CaECo,6894570,6900810,your back because if you can look up you  can get up see a lot of people because  of failure they stop they stop believing
KlFua-CaECo,6900810,6905630,let me share something with you you will  fail your way to success
KlFua-CaECo,6906300,6914410,so many times we're waiting we're  waiting I'm waiting eight out of ten
KlFua-CaECo,6914410,6920920,millionaires have been financially  bankrupt you will fill your way to  success it doesn't matter how many times
KlFua-CaECo,6920920,6926020,you fail it doesn't matter how many  times people tell you that you can't do  it it doesn't matter if you don't have a
KlFua-CaECo,6926020,6931060,dime in the Bakke you will fail your way  to success what's the standard they hold

KlFua-CaECo,7212690,7218120,follow your passions I say this [ __ ]  right I say follow your efforts it's  amazing how we're all passionate about
KlFua-CaECo,7218120,7224540,things we are all passionate about
KlFua-CaECo,7224540,7229770,something helping veterans and helping  this organization helping this crew  that's great
KlFua-CaECo,7229770,7236330,[Music]  but it no matter what it all nets out to  where do you put your time because when
KlFua-CaECo,7236330,7242180,people put in their time you get better  at things and when you get better at  something you get good at something then  you have a chance to be great at
KlFua-CaECo,7242180,7247910,something you know what I've learned  nobody ever quits anything they're great  at and once you get great at it it's
KlFua-CaECo,7247910,7255710,amazing how passionate you become about  it follow your efforts you are the
KlFua-CaECo,7255710,7262340,architect of tomorrow sometimes in order
KlFua-CaECo,7262340,7268940,to stay on our priority pathway yeah you  got to say no kind of thing so I've
KlFua-CaECo,7268940,7277700,really become a master of saying that's  just not working for me but in years  past I was too cluttered so every single
KlFua-CaECo,7277700,7282800,organization on the planet even our own  careers always function on the same  three levels what we do how we do it and
KlFua-CaECo,7282800,7289280,why we do it everybody knows what they  do these are the products we sell the  services we offer some know how they do
KlFua-CaECo,7289280,7295250,it  these we these are things we call our  unique selling propositions or you know  our differentiating value brothers
KlFua-CaECo,7295250,7300470,whatever the things that we think make  us stand out from the crowd but very  very few people and very very few
KlFua-CaECo,7300470,7306980,organizations can clearly articulate why  they do what they do and by I don't mean  to make money that's a result by why I
KlFua-CaECo,7306980,7312260,mean what is your purpose what is your  cause what is your belief why does your  company exist why did you get out of bed
KlFua-CaECo,7312260,7320120,this morning and why should anyone care  and what I learned is that organizations  or leaders that start with by telling
KlFua-CaECo,7320120,7326810,you what they do are less able to  inspire people to do business with them  inspire loyalty where those who start
KlFua-CaECo,7326810,7332810,with why whether it's Steve Jobs or mama  Gandhi are able to command loyalty and
KlFua-CaECo,7332810,7338010,are able to  innovate in ways that others cannot and  the reason I say that every company
KlFua-CaECo,7338010,7343230,functions this way is because the model  is not based on highfalutin management  theory it's based on the biology of
KlFua-CaECo,7343230,7349980,human decision-making this is how the  brain works  that when you start with Y it talks to  the part of brain of the brain that is
KlFua-CaECo,7349980,7355079,responsible for decision-making and  feelings like trust and loyalty but it's
KlFua-CaECo,7355079,7362069,not responsible for language which is  why it's hard to put into words  [Music]
KlFua-CaECo,7372619,7378179,get up get out go meet the world head-on  go meet whatever it is okay you got to
KlFua-CaECo,7378179,7384810,make up to somebody you got to apologize  for something you've done you got to  make up by the damage of of years of
KlFua-CaECo,7384810,7390659,neglect and maybe betrayal and look I've  done all that I've had all those things
KlFua-CaECo,7390659,7397290,where I screwed up over and over and  over again my reputation sucked I was 20
KlFua-CaECo,7397290,7404670,between the ages of 15 and 25 years old  it was like I was doing everything I  could just to damage damage my
KlFua-CaECo,7404670,7410850,reputation okay if it made me look bad I  did it so here today I'm gonna spend ten
KlFua-CaECo,7410850,7417090,days 14 days something like that up here  with that view you can fix anything I'm
KlFua-CaECo,7417090,7423300,proof that you can fix anything anything  can be fixed anything can be fixed but
KlFua-CaECo,7423300,7431340,you got to fix it you got to fix it you  can't just sweep it under the old rug  you gotta fix it you gotta clean up the
KlFua-CaECo,7431340,7436869,damage you got to pay the price clean up  your debts
KlFua-CaECo,7436869,7444940,do what you say you're gonna do become  the most dependable person in your space  and come to go to person oh I can put
KlFua-CaECo,7444940,7451630,that person on stage and know exactly  what they're gonna get for me I can put  that person in the game  and I know what play they're gonna run I
KlFua-CaECo,7451630,7460929,can put that person on the floor and I  know they're gonna get it done be the  go-to person you know those first couple
KlFua-CaECo,7460929,7467139,months I remember thinking to myself I'm  in business two months now you know I  remember getting to the point where I
KlFua-CaECo,7467139,7474610,"had $15,000 in sales probably six months  into the company and I'm still living in  the hole and thinking okay I can do this"
KlFua-CaECo,7474610,7480040,I can do this and along the way it was  lots of trial and error you know there
KlFua-CaECo,7480040,7485320,were things that were new to meet things  that were terrifying to me things that  would just break out into a sweat but I
KlFua-CaECo,7485320,7492580,always remember going into my customers  and just trying to be brutally honest  and say to them if I can help you right
KlFua-CaECo,7492580,7499929,if I can bring value if I can make your  company more competitive more profitable  will you work with me and you don't have
KlFua-CaECo,7499929,7506619,to put money I'll do the work to prove  it and if I get it done then we'll met  you know we'll figure it all out you
KlFua-CaECo,7506619,7512800,know or they agree to a price and then  they'll pay it at that point and one by  one I just kept on making customers
KlFua-CaECo,7512800,7518830,happy and lost some you know for  everyone I lost picked up three and I
KlFua-CaECo,7518830,7524230,got I was so nervous about the whole  thing  that you know I just I couldn't imagine
KlFua-CaECo,7524230,7529900,slowing down you know and so people talk  about you know life family balance I
KlFua-CaECo,7529900,7535809,hadn't done I mean I literally remember  dating some girl this is  and it was like we've been dating a
KlFua-CaECo,7535809,7543010,couple years like it mark you're so into  your work I mean I want to pick a fence  I want a house I want kids you know I
KlFua-CaECo,7543010,7548079,mean you it's me or your job and I was  like or me and you're me or your company
KlFua-CaECo,7548079,7555999,and I was like what's your name again  I'm 60 years old and I'm everybody who
KlFua-CaECo,7555999,7561059,works for me is younger than me and  they'll tell you I worked you up under  the table
KlFua-CaECo,7561059,7567459,vision is an internal thing right it is  the world that you want to live in right
KlFua-CaECo,7567459,7575380,Jobs was the rebel and he always was  against big business all the visionaries
KlFua-CaECo,7575380,7583719,that we know has some sort of personal  experience and imagine a world that is  different to the one they live in now  and we'll use their businesses to help
KlFua-CaECo,7583719,7591189,build that world that doesn't mean  they're the only ones doing it but what  makes them a leader is they're the one  leading towards that place right so
KlFua-CaECo,7591189,7596289,vision has to come from you if you're  the founder of a company your business  is not the only way you do it what have
KlFua-CaECo,7596289,7601929,you quit your business and start another  one it doesn't matter they should all be  contributing towards this vision and
KlFua-CaECo,7601929,7607449,you're not the only one doing it but if  you're the one preaching it and you're  using your company to advance it that
KlFua-CaECo,7607449,7612820,makes you the leader that's where  everybody copies you but it's not about  anticipating the market trend which is
KlFua-CaECo,7612820,7619000,an interest thing you're asking me it's  got to start with values  the interest comes second
KlFua-CaECo,7619000,7626329,[Music]  you can make mistakes in you like make  them fast right you're gonna lose a deal
KlFua-CaECo,7626329,7635239,make them lose the deal faster you're  not gonna make any money on the deal  make sure the deals quick there's part
KlFua-CaECo,7635239,7640669,of you that either once you create a  business or you all obviously already  have created a business the hardest part
KlFua-CaECo,7640669,7645859,is taking that first step right there's  always that line like I was talking  about earlier that you have to take a
KlFua-CaECo,7645859,7652399,step pass but the thing people always  say well you know you're not afraid to  start a business why aren't you it's
KlFua-CaECo,7652399,7658639,terrifying or you know I just it scares  me to do it and my my attitude has
KlFua-CaECo,7658639,7665300,always been if you're prepared it's not  a risk right Bobby Knight who was the  coach at Indiana University used to say
KlFua-CaECo,7665300,7671179,everybody's got the will to win but it's  only those with the will to prepare that  do win and the same applies to business
KlFua-CaECo,7671179,7676699,we've all seen her friends go out there  and just wing it  you know it's my passion we're all
KlFua-CaECo,7676699,7682249,passionate about something I'm  passionate about basketball doesn't make  me an NBA player right it's not just
KlFua-CaECo,7682249,7687800,about passion it's not just about saying  I'm doing it it's not even about  incorporating it's not about the idea
KlFua-CaECo,7687800,7694459,it's about are you prepared and are you  willing to do the work you gotta quit
KlFua-CaECo,7694459,7702439,you got to quit saying nonsense occult  stuff like you know I'm happy where I'm  at and we're good we're all good you
KlFua-CaECo,7702439,7707569,know this is just good everything's good  and I'm better off with somebody and  that you got to comparing yourself to
KlFua-CaECo,7707569,7713300,other people you got to quit talking  like the middle-class like like you've  somehow arrived because somebody in Iran
KlFua-CaECo,7713300,7719449,is suffering yeah you know you're good  until you're not there's nobody watching  that gets enough money to charity yeah
KlFua-CaECo,7719449,7725839,okay everybody watching should be able  to give a million dollars a year to  charity but you can't you know why you  can't you would if you could but you
KlFua-CaECo,7725839,7731239,can't because you didn't know you didn't  produce enough because by the way it's  not your money anyway yeah somebody else
KlFua-CaECo,7731239,7737359,gave you the money and you pass it on  most of you like I'm really charitable  I'm really good but you never do enough  why because you never have enough
KlFua-CaECo,7737359,7746530,because you didn't produce enough  because you didn't work enough because  you didn't expect it so I would just say  to people look have some loftier goals
KlFua-CaECo,7747159,7753469,you are at your best when you are  authentic to your core and you have to
KlFua-CaECo,7753469,7760280,be what you are not what they call you  you know I I tend to believe that
KlFua-CaECo,7760280,7767389,there's no finality or anything you know  it's not like you know your even though  we do our lives are finite life is
KlFua-CaECo,7767389,7773690,infinite and your life goes on and for  me the goal is not to produce something  that has an end point but to produce
KlFua-CaECo,7773690,7780400,something that has momentum that kind of  you
KlFua-CaECo,7790860,7792920,you
