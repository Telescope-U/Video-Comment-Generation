-xFtboP_loY,195920,201519,life what's it going to take for you to  change what's it going to take for you  to realize your potential what's it
-xFtboP_loY,201519,207840,going to take for you to be proud proud  of the person you are proud of your  effort proud of the person you become
-xFtboP_loY,207840,211879,what is it going to take
-xFtboP_loY,212879,218640,i don't care how scared you are  what you need to do  is make
-xFtboP_loY,218640,225840,bold decisions  right now you've got to begin training  yourself to act you've got to begin
-xFtboP_loY,225840,230959,training yourself to take chances to put  yourself at risk to risk embarrassment
-xFtboP_loY,230959,236319,to know  that you're going to fail  that's the only way that you're ever
-xFtboP_loY,236319,241920,going to get the things that you want  out of life all of us want to do  something extraordinary all of us want
-xFtboP_loY,241920,248080,to be great all of us have something  inside ourselves that if we knew we  couldn't fail we would pursue that
-xFtboP_loY,248080,253760,and that question what would you do if  you knew you couldn't fail  that question is one of the most
-xFtboP_loY,253760,259440,important questions that you can ever  ask yourself  and the reality is you can do that thing
-xFtboP_loY,259440,265840,but you're gonna have to be bold you're  going to have to take chances you're  going to have to put everything at risk  and the problem is the reason that
-xFtboP_loY,265840,271840,people play things so safe is because  it's so comfortable there it's so easy  there and every day passes by without
-xFtboP_loY,271840,278000,you noticing that terrifying passage of  time but once you realize that this is  it this is the one shot that you have
-xFtboP_loY,278000,283840,and what does it really matter if you  fail what does it really matter what  other people think the only thing that  really matters is what do you think
-xFtboP_loY,283840,289040,about yourself  and let me tell you right now  that
-xFtboP_loY,289040,294560,self belief  is going to be built of knowing that  you're willing to try
-xFtboP_loY,294560,300000,it isn't going to be built on whether or  not you succeed it's going to be built  on whether or not you try whether or not
-xFtboP_loY,300000,305440,you show up in that moment that thing  that you've rehearsed in your head a  thousand times where you hope you will
-xFtboP_loY,305440,310960,be courageous  be courageous  know that about yourself know that every
-xFtboP_loY,310960,318000,moment is that moment sometimes it's so  small it seems imperceptible it seems  like it's not a moment for courage
-xFtboP_loY,318000,324560,but every moment is a moment for courage  every moment right now is your chance to  act to strike to be bold to do the thing
-xFtboP_loY,324560,330560,that you're afraid you won't be able to  do but to do the thing you know  could lead you where you want to go to
-xFtboP_loY,330560,336320,do the thing that you would do if you  knew you couldn't fail  but courage is doing it
-xFtboP_loY,336320,341840,even though you might fail  so be  courageous
-xFtboP_loY,341840,346880,be  bold  strike now
-xFtboP_loY,347919,354960,it's supposed to be hard if it were easy  everyone would do it  keep your mouth shut and work let your
-xFtboP_loY,354960,360160,success make the noise  i demand success
-xFtboP_loY,360160,368160,success and nothing less  i will achieve  success i will never settle for anything
-xFtboP_loY,368160,374800,less  i will work harder than the rest
-xFtboP_loY,374800,381840,i will challenge the best  i will fight through any of life's tests
-xFtboP_loY,385280,393720,i am not blessed because everything went  right  i'm blessed because i got fight
-xFtboP_loY,394880,401840,when challenges come up  i don't say why me  when tough times arrive
-xFtboP_loY,401840,408400,i never think why did this happen to me  i say how can i use this
-xFtboP_loY,408400,414880,i say what can i gain from this  how can i ensure that i improve my life
-xFtboP_loY,414880,422240,so this doesn't happen again  that's my blessing  not what i've got to work with but how i
-xFtboP_loY,422240,427360,work with what i got  not that i was handed my dreams
-xFtboP_loY,427360,432560,but that i had enough fight in me  that i had enough belief in me
-xFtboP_loY,432560,439680,to go after my dream  that i had the courage to keep going  to push through the pain
-xFtboP_loY,439680,445199,to rise through the darkness  and to tell my story on the other side
-xFtboP_loY,445199,451280,my story  my blessed story
-xFtboP_loY,451280,456479,it doesn't matter where you are in life  if you don't feel blessed
-xFtboP_loY,456479,462479,you won't be blessed  you gotta appreciate what you have  inside you
-xFtboP_loY,462479,468639,before you can see the gifts outside of  you  you got to know your worth
-xFtboP_loY,468639,474639,before you can be worth anything  you got to know you're great
-xFtboP_loY,474639,479840,before anyone else will see the  greatness within you
-xFtboP_loY,479840,486639,you gotta feel blessed  before you will be blessed  today could be the day
-xFtboP_loY,486639,494479,are you ready to commit  [Music]  are you ready for greatness
-xFtboP_loY,494479,502240,i'm not blessed  cause everything went right i'm blessed  cause i got fight
-xFtboP_loY,502639,507919,i've been through some tough times in my  life times where i didn't think i could  make it
-xFtboP_loY,507919,515200,sometimes  well maybe i didn't want to make it  but every time i was down i got up i
-xFtboP_loY,515200,521120,fought back  i rose to the occasion  listen to me

-xFtboP_loY,533200,538399,get up  get up  whatever you're going through
-xFtboP_loY,538399,544800,it is temporary it is not  permanent  unless you let it be
-xFtboP_loY,544800,550480,this challenge was not set to destroy it  was said to define it
-xFtboP_loY,550480,557519,everything comes down to you  your choices  the meaning you give to every moment in
-xFtboP_loY,557519,563200,your life  get up you'll never find the answers you  need darling you'll never reach the peak

-xFtboP_loY,653360,660160,how you will get there and get moving  keep climbing see effort is what
-xFtboP_loY,660160,666320,separates the boys  from the men  what you do every day
-xFtboP_loY,666320,671760,will dictate your future  what you want  out of your life
-xFtboP_loY,671760,676959,it's what you got to put in  yeah  failure happens
-xFtboP_loY,676959,682160,mistakes as well  but without them  how could you grow
-xFtboP_loY,682160,690000,how can you become that successful  entrepreneur without learning  the lessons of failure
-xFtboP_loY,690000,696640,how much effort would you put in today  to guarantee the future for your family
-xFtboP_loY,696640,701680,to guarantee  the empire  that you dreamed of
-xFtboP_loY,701680,706720,as a kid  most of you claim you've been working
-xFtboP_loY,706720,713040,hard because you got tired  oh i did work hard but success still  didn't come
-xFtboP_loY,713040,718720,no  you worked until you got tired  tired doesn't equal hard work it's how
-xFtboP_loY,718720,724880,hard you work after you get tired when  you get tired  that is when the real work starts
-xFtboP_loY,724880,730800,how hard do you push when you get tired  how many reps have you got left in you
-xFtboP_loY,730800,736800,when your body says no  how many hours have you got left in you
-xFtboP_loY,736800,744800,when the mind says no  how many times can you get back up after  life has beaten you down time and time
-xFtboP_loY,744800,751279,again  if you want better than average you have
-xFtboP_loY,751279,756800,to work  harder than the average  if you want greatness your effort must
-xFtboP_loY,756800,763200,be greater than great it's not all about  physical effort it's about the effort  you apply to learning the effort you
-xFtboP_loY,763200,768720,apply to growing  the effort you apply to finding  solutions
-xFtboP_loY,768720,775279,is as much about working smart is it is  hard  the effort to put in to become a better
-xFtboP_loY,775279,783200,person  a more understanding person  the effort you put in to helping others
-xFtboP_loY,783200,789600,how many other lives do you impact  around you  from the efforts you give to others
-xFtboP_loY,789600,796800,your quality of life depends on your  effort  it doesn't matter what success means to  you whatever it is it will require your
-xFtboP_loY,796800,804320,effort  if you want to be a good friend a good  parent  effort is required if you want financial
-xFtboP_loY,804320,809760,success or physical strength  effort is required and your level of
-xFtboP_loY,809760,815120,effort will equal your level of results  there are no mistakes
-xFtboP_loY,815120,822320,give your all  every day  every minute of everything
-xFtboP_loY,822320,829040,your best effort  in each present moment will lead to your  best future moments
-xFtboP_loY,829040,836240,there are no mistakes  all your effort  all you got
-xFtboP_loY,836639,843040,why do you want that dream so bad  why are you willing to put in all those
-xFtboP_loY,843040,848480,extra hours  why are you willing to sacrifice and
-xFtboP_loY,848480,854160,fight for that dream  it's not for the money
-xFtboP_loY,854160,859519,it's for the freedom  the opposite of freedom
-xFtboP_loY,859519,865279,is slavery  being a slave to your own negative  thoughts
-xFtboP_loY,865279,870399,being a slave to others expectations and  opinions
-xFtboP_loY,870399,876480,being a slave to limitations  why are you prepared to risk everything
-xFtboP_loY,876480,882720,for that dream that no one can see but  you  why would you prefer to put in 80 hours
-xFtboP_loY,882720,888560,a week for your own dream just so you  don't have to put in 40 for someone  else's
-xFtboP_loY,888560,894320,freedom  freedom  because you will never get that freedom
-xFtboP_loY,894320,899440,working for someone else  you'll never be in control working for
-xFtboP_loY,899440,904880,someone else  going your own way is the only shot at
-xFtboP_loY,904880,912240,freedom  going your own way is the only way you  get to call the shots
-xFtboP_loY,912240,917440,it's much harder that way and the  chances of success are very slim
-xFtboP_loY,917440,922480,but you have no chance of getting that  freedom if you settle
-xFtboP_loY,922480,927600,true freedom  is freedom of choice freedom of others
-xFtboP_loY,927600,933920,opinions  freedom of the mind  freedom of negative thoughts
-xFtboP_loY,933920,939600,if you want freedom you're going to have  to earn it  work until you can say
-xFtboP_loY,939600,946560,i'm living life on my terms  i created this
-xFtboP_loY,947600,955120,if you want freedom there's going to be  an element of risk  there's going to have to be sacrifices
-xFtboP_loY,955120,962240,made  there's going to have to be late nights  extra hours persistence and most
-xFtboP_loY,962240,967600,importantly growth  if you don't become someone else you
-xFtboP_loY,967600,973360,will not be able to earn your freedom  the person you are right now might not
-xFtboP_loY,973360,978800,be good enough for the life you want  if you really want it
-xFtboP_loY,978800,984000,you're going to have to become someone  else  [Music]
-xFtboP_loY,984000,989120,you know the greatest thing money buys  it buys freedom
-xFtboP_loY,989120,995120,you know the greatest thing  self-development does for you  it gives you freedom the more you
-xFtboP_loY,995120,1001440,develop yourself  the more choices you have in life the  more you learn the more you develop the
-xFtboP_loY,1001440,1008320,more skills you grow the better you  become the greater your freedom  if you think your success in life is
-xFtboP_loY,1008320,1014639,determined by factors outside of your  control then you will never be in
-xFtboP_loY,1014639,1020959,control  if you don't believe you can do it you  will never get the effort required to do
-xFtboP_loY,1020959,1026240,it  i'll tell you who freedom will never  come to freedom will never come to those
-xFtboP_loY,1026240,1032400,who quit  never to those who give up never to  those who choose the easy path
-xFtboP_loY,1032400,1038000,never to those who lack self-discipline  never to those who refuse to work on
-xFtboP_loY,1038000,1045120,themselves never to those who seek  comfort over growth  never to those who seek security over
-xFtboP_loY,1045120,1050960,their future  your results in life are determined by  you your work
-xFtboP_loY,1050960,1057760,your belief your sacrifice your  discipline nothing else but you
-xFtboP_loY,1057760,1065679,none of you want the success for the  money alone money is paper it's  meaningless by itself but what it does
-xFtboP_loY,1065679,1071840,for you that is priceless it can give  you freedom freedom to choose what to do
-xFtboP_loY,1071840,1077840,freedom to choose where to do what you  do  there has never lived a self-made human
-xFtboP_loY,1077840,1084400,being who created a successful fulfilled  life by luck chance or having everything
-xFtboP_loY,1084400,1091600,work out perfectly  freedom is earned  living a life you love will not come
-xFtboP_loY,1091600,1098480,unless you are willing to earn it  are you willing to earn it
-xFtboP_loY,1098480,1104559,how do you get that freedom that's not  one element there's not one trick or  hack it's a relentless pursuit of
-xFtboP_loY,1104559,1111600,self-improvement and the more you  improve  the greater your chances of living a  life on your own terms
-xFtboP_loY,1111600,1117600,most people think the safe bet is taking  a comfortable job you get benefits you
-xFtboP_loY,1117600,1125840,get holidays  but in doing that you sacrifice your  freedom the safest bet is always to bet
-xFtboP_loY,1125840,1131440,on yourself  it won't pay off right away and that's  why most people quit
-xFtboP_loY,1131440,1137039,they don't back themselves and that's  why they lose their freedom
-xFtboP_loY,1137039,1144640,when you bet on yourself and back  yourself to win in the end you are  placing a bet on your future
-xFtboP_loY,1144640,1152240,when you actually apply what you learn  and continue to learn and continue to  grow and keep moving forward with tiny
-xFtboP_loY,1152240,1158400,steps refusing to give up along that  journey eventually you will win
-xFtboP_loY,1158400,1164720,eventually you will get to a place where  you decide what you want to do each day
-xFtboP_loY,1164720,1170320,no boss to tell you what time to start  when to take breaks or have holidays

-xFtboP_loY,2522800,2529119,habits resurface and you feel like  giving less than your best  never forget the quote
-xFtboP_loY,2529119,2534319,give me 100  and you will get 110 back
-xFtboP_loY,2534319,2540480,if you give me 99  you're not getting anything back
-xFtboP_loY,2542319,2548560,i heard ed milette once say  you're one decision away from a totally
-xFtboP_loY,2548560,2555440,different life and i agree with him but  i want to ask you this  what is that one decision
-xFtboP_loY,2555440,2562560,and the answer is  to take complete and total  responsibility for everything in your
-xFtboP_loY,2562560,2568240,life  and i mean everything the way that i  explain it to people is if my wife were
-xFtboP_loY,2568240,2575680,hit and killed by a meteorite i would  take responsibility for that i would say  that that is my fault not to blame me or
-xFtboP_loY,2575680,2582480,to put shame on me but to remind myself  that i'm in control that there was  always something i could have done now i
-xFtboP_loY,2582480,2587680,know that that's true as crazy as that  sounds but i know right now there are a
-xFtboP_loY,2587680,2593520,group of people tracking what are called  near-earth objects making sure that if  something like a meteorite is on a
-xFtboP_loY,2593520,2599440,collision course with earth that they  can do something to stop it now even  though  i know they exist i've never done
-xFtboP_loY,2599440,2604480,anything to help them i've never given  them money or ideas or encouraging words
-xFtboP_loY,2604480,2610160,and i think that's the right answer i  think the likelihood of my wife being  killed by a meteorite are virtually zero
-xFtboP_loY,2610160,2615280,but if it happened  i wouldn't waste time  saying there was nothing i could have
-xFtboP_loY,2615280,2621920,done about it i know i have made a  choice and at the end of the day that's  the most powerful realization that you
-xFtboP_loY,2621920,2627200,can have that even inaction is a choice  you're deciding every minute what you're
-xFtboP_loY,2627200,2632880,going to do with your time your energies  your intelligence your focus all of it  you're deciding how to use it and your
-xFtboP_loY,2632880,2638400,life right now is an exact reflection of  the choices you've made for better or
-xFtboP_loY,2638400,2644880,worse if you love your life  congratulations you're making the right  decisions and if you hate your life
-xFtboP_loY,2644880,2651280,that's on nobody but you  and that's the best  news i can give you that's the most
-xFtboP_loY,2651280,2656720,comforting thing i could say  why  because you can do something about it if
-xFtboP_loY,2656720,2662800,it were somebody else's fault if life  were happening to you if you weren't in  control then there's nothing that you
-xFtboP_loY,2662800,2669760,could do to get out of your situation  but the reality is you are in control
-xFtboP_loY,2669760,2675920,every moment is an opportunity to do  something different and when you make  different choices when you take
-xFtboP_loY,2675920,2682240,different actions when you do different  things you get a different result  there's a reason that einstein said the
-xFtboP_loY,2682240,2689680,very definition of insanity is to do the  same thing and expect a different result
-xFtboP_loY,2689680,2695359,so if you want something new for your  life it is very attainable you can have  something new you can have all of the
-xFtboP_loY,2695359,2700720,things that you want but you're going to  have to work your ass off you're going  to have to make the right decisions and
-xFtboP_loY,2700720,2707200,that's a hard thing to face it's hard to  accept that simply wanting it or being a  good person or trying
-xFtboP_loY,2707200,2712480,isn't  enough  but it's not  you've got to work until you find the
-xFtboP_loY,2712480,2717680,right answer you've got to be willing to  fail and fumble around until you find  the path that actually works but once
-xFtboP_loY,2717680,2722880,you hold yourself to the standard of  efficacy that it actually got you the
-xFtboP_loY,2722880,2729040,desired result  then your fumbling is going to be all  for nothing because it's not directed at  anything you'll never know if you're
-xFtboP_loY,2729040,2734560,hitting the mark if you don't have  anything to aim at but once you have  that clarity and you know exactly what
-xFtboP_loY,2734560,2741040,you're going for and you accept  responsibility for whether or not you're  getting there
-xFtboP_loY,2741040,2747599,then everything changes  because you have the power  so right now take your life back right
-xFtboP_loY,2747599,2754480,now no matter what is going on no matter  what has happened to you no matter what  crazy things have befallen you that seem
-xFtboP_loY,2754480,2760480,like fate  take ownership  don't beat yourself up
-xFtboP_loY,2760480,2765760,don't waste time feeling badly about it  just recognize you are far
-xFtboP_loY,2765760,2772560,more powerful  and capable than you know  and once you take that
-xFtboP_loY,2772560,2779200,once you take the reins of your life  you can make the changes and the  decisions that you need to get wherever
-xFtboP_loY,2779200,2785599,you want to go  and that truly is  the most powerful realization
-xFtboP_loY,2785599,2790620,the most important decision  any of us  can ever make
-xFtboP_loY,2790620,2798079,[Music]  never allow people who gave up on their
-xFtboP_loY,2798079,2803839,dreams convince you to give up on yours  i won't be led astray by the opinions of
-xFtboP_loY,2803839,2810720,others by those who were too scared to  go after their dreams those who lack the  courage to fight for their dream
-xFtboP_loY,2810720,2816800,it's not only your enemies and haters  that will discourage you but your own  family and friends too
-xFtboP_loY,2816800,2822319,your parents almost always want what's  best for you they talk you out of your  dream because they don't want you to get
-xFtboP_loY,2822319,2828800,hurt  they're conditioned to keep you from  being hurt  going right back to when you were a baby
-xFtboP_loY,2828800,2834560,you are not a baby anymore you're a man  you're a woman
-xFtboP_loY,2834560,2840240,you're strong  you're your own person with your own  opinions

-xFtboP_loY,2845359,2850480,capable of making your own choices  and you are strong enough to handle the
-xFtboP_loY,2850480,2856400,consequences if it doesn't work out you  are big enough to handle any challenge
-xFtboP_loY,2856400,2861650,that comes based on the decisions you  make  on your own
-xFtboP_loY,2861650,2868319,[Music]  you call it truth  i call it opinion  if i want an average
-xFtboP_loY,2868319,2875520,i would ask for their opinion please  don't get me wrong i'm sure average is  great but average is not something i'm
-xFtboP_loY,2875520,2883760,seeking right now  so best of luck  and move along  your truth is not my reality your

-xFtboP_loY,2921359,2926400,it's found in your own inner voice it's  the courage inside you the courage that
-xFtboP_loY,2926400,2933040,has no fear of failure no fear of  opinions it's found in following your  heart not what's best for your mom or
-xFtboP_loY,2933040,2941200,dad not what society says is good or bad  not what makes you look important but  what you want
-xFtboP_loY,2941760,2946880,critics  doubters haters naysayers they will all
-xFtboP_loY,2946880,2952640,discourage you because they are  threatened by your success  they believe that if you become
-xFtboP_loY,2952640,2958240,successful they will be less significant  if you become successful they will be
-xFtboP_loY,2958240,2963920,left behind  by you becoming more they will become  less
-xFtboP_loY,2963920,2969520,by you doing something with your life it  highlights the fact they have it's a
-xFtboP_loY,2969520,2975760,small mind mentality insecurity are you  going to let insecure individuals bring
-xFtboP_loY,2975760,2982319,you down to their level  everyone has an opinion
-xFtboP_loY,2982319,2989119,usually those with a lack of skill have  a louder opinion than those with  talented they say the hardest prison to
-xFtboP_loY,2989119,2995839,escape is your own mind very often that  is so true mostly because our minds are
-xFtboP_loY,2995839,3002960,exploding with the opinions of others  trying to fit into this world trying to  live up to others expectations comparing
-xFtboP_loY,3002960,3010640,ourselves to others mistaking opinions  for the truth  escape that prison and live free live
-xFtboP_loY,3010640,3017440,like a king and answer only to  your  self
-xFtboP_loY,3017440,3023440,so many people never go for what they  want because of the fear of others  opinions
-xFtboP_loY,3023440,3029359,because of the fear of the word no  because of haters and naysayers
-xFtboP_loY,3029359,3036640,that will never be me  i refuse to listen to the voices that  will never understand my dream

-xFtboP_loY,3126240,3132079,you have to be a visionary  picture everything you want so clearly
-xFtboP_loY,3132079,3138960,in your mind until you can see it right  in front of you write it all down on a  piece of paper create a vision board
-xFtboP_loY,3138960,3146800,then you will have evidence in the  future evidence of the amazing power of  your mind the amazing power of you if

-xFtboP_loY,3154240,3159440,the life that is in front of you  you have to be able to see outside of
-xFtboP_loY,3159440,3164960,your current situation you must be able  to acknowledge where you are in life but
-xFtboP_loY,3164960,3171680,know you are capable of creating so much  more know that where you are right now
-xFtboP_loY,3171680,3178400,is not your life  you are where you are right now because  of your past decisions and your past
-xFtboP_loY,3178400,3183520,beliefs  now it's time to sum up the courage to
-xFtboP_loY,3183520,3190240,ask for better to believe in better to  believe magic is on the way
-xFtboP_loY,3190240,3196240,now  it's time to get what you deserve  in life
-xFtboP_loY,3196240,3201839,we don't get what we ask for  we get what we ask and work for

-xFtboP_loY,3220720,3226319,it's not work you do need to do  something but you do it because you love
-xFtboP_loY,3226319,3232559,doing it not because you have to  and that's where the magic is created
-xFtboP_loY,3232559,3240240,you add value to others by doing what  you want to do and you get rewarded what  you want is not going to come to you by
-xFtboP_loY,3240240,3245760,just dreaming about  when you get in your car to go somewhere  you would never expect to arrive at the
-xFtboP_loY,3245760,3252400,destination by just closing your eyes  and dreaming about it you know you can't  get there instantly you must know where
-xFtboP_loY,3252400,3257760,you're going but you also understand  that right now you are here and in order
-xFtboP_loY,3257760,3264559,to get to your destination there is  going to be a journey  there might be roadblocks detours stop
-xFtboP_loY,3264559,3270160,signs even breakdowns but if you really  must get to that destination you can and
-xFtboP_loY,3270160,3277359,will find a way you would never stop  halfway and turn around because of a  detour a setback or an obstacle you just
-xFtboP_loY,3277359,3283680,take whatever path leads to your  destination even if it wasn't the path  you planned on taking even if it wasn't
-xFtboP_loY,3283680,3290319,the easiest path  life is no different  if you want something anything in your
-xFtboP_loY,3290319,3297119,life you must first know where you are  and then you must know what it is going  to take to get there
-xFtboP_loY,3297119,3302400,you make a commitment that no matter  what happens i will reach that  destination
-xFtboP_loY,3302400,3307520,if i have to go the long way i'll go the  long way if i have to learn a new way
-xFtboP_loY,3307520,3314480,i'll learn a new way if there are  detours roadblocks or breakdowns i will  keep going fix the issue get patched up
-xFtboP_loY,3314480,3320319,but i will never quit  if you just know  if you just believe you will get there
-xFtboP_loY,3320319,3327119,and you have the courage to see it  through there is nothing you can't have  nowhere you can't go and no one you
-xFtboP_loY,3327119,3332640,can't become  muhammad ali said the man who has no
-xFtboP_loY,3332640,3338480,imagination has no wings if you can't  envision it if you can't believe it you
-xFtboP_loY,3338480,3345920,will never see it you will never be it  you see if you want to live an average  life that is fine keep your feet on the
-xFtboP_loY,3345920,3350960,ground but if you want to soar if you  want to achieve great things you must
-xFtboP_loY,3350960,3356000,not only think those crazy thoughts but  feel it feel what it would feel like to
-xFtboP_loY,3356000,3361280,be doing that thing you want to do feel  what it feels like to have all the
-xFtboP_loY,3361280,3366400,things you want  to be the person that has achieved the  things you want to achieve
-xFtboP_loY,3366400,3371599,the very process of you feeling like you  already have it will send vibrational
-xFtboP_loY,3371599,3378160,signals to your brain and if you are  willing to work for it it will be in  your life very soon
-xFtboP_loY,3378160,3383440,albert einstein once said  your imagination  is everything
-xFtboP_loY,3383440,3389359,it is the preview of life's coming  attractions  only those who believe anything is
-xFtboP_loY,3389359,3394720,possible can achieve the things  most would consider impossible
-xFtboP_loY,3394720,3399920,you must know who you are going to be  before you become that person you must
-xFtboP_loY,3399920,3407280,picture what you want to achieve and  feel like you already have it before you  can bring it into your reality
-xFtboP_loY,3407280,3413119,in the greatest book of all time think  and grow rich  napoleon hill states
-xFtboP_loY,3413119,3419760,whatever the mind of man can conceive  and believe  it can't achieve he says
-xFtboP_loY,3419760,3425280,you are the master of your destiny you  can influence direct and control your
-xFtboP_loY,3425280,3432400,own environment  you can make your life what you want it  to be it's not a magic trick it's not a
-xFtboP_loY,3432400,3438160,new philosophy  most of you know about it and if you  don't you should start paying attention
-xFtboP_loY,3438160,3444400,because just about anyone who is great  knows about it  as robin sharma said
-xFtboP_loY,3444400,3451520,everything is created twice  first in the mind  and then in reality
-xFtboP_loY,3451839,3459280,there is an energy and power far greater  than we can comprehend at play and we  can either use it live in harmony with
-xFtboP_loY,3459280,3464480,it create with it or run in fear from it
-xFtboP_loY,3466160,3472400,you don't like where you are  change something  you don't like your body
-xFtboP_loY,3472400,3478559,change something you don't like being in  debt  change something
-xFtboP_loY,3478559,3483839,you don't like your job  change it  do something about it
-xFtboP_loY,3483839,3489599,you don't like how miserable you are all  the time  change something
-xFtboP_loY,3489599,3495119,complaining about your situation  is not going to change your situation
-xFtboP_loY,3495119,3502079,no one is coming to save you  there's a reason why einstein labeled  the definition of insanity as doing the
-xFtboP_loY,3502079,3507839,same thing over and over but expecting a  different result
-xFtboP_loY,3507839,3514559,nothing will change until you change  something  nothing in your life will improve until
-xFtboP_loY,3514559,3519760,you get off your pity potty and improve  it yourself  how can it
-xFtboP_loY,3519760,3525760,seriously how do you expect anything  will change if you don't change anything
-xFtboP_loY,3525760,3533920,two plus two always equals four if you  want to get to five you're going to have  to change a number it's law it's common
-xFtboP_loY,3533920,3540400,sense  you want change  change something you want better in your
-xFtboP_loY,3540400,3547119,life sorry to bring the bad news but  it's you and you alone that is going to  have to be better
-xFtboP_loY,3547119,3553839,but that's also the good news because  you are in control  you're in control of how you feel
-xFtboP_loY,3553839,3559680,and you're in control over the  improvement that your future can see  if you make daily changes daily
-xFtboP_loY,3559680,3565280,improvements to make your life better it  really is all up to you
-xFtboP_loY,3565280,3571040,tolstoy once said everyone thinks of  changing the world but no one thinks of
-xFtboP_loY,3571040,3576480,changing himself and that's just it  isn't it  you can't change the world until you
-xFtboP_loY,3576480,3581920,change yourself  you can't have better relationships  until you are better in relationships
-xFtboP_loY,3581920,3588079,you can't have a better body or health  until you make the changes that make  them better you have to take radical and
-xFtboP_loY,3588079,3595680,absolute responsibility for everything  in your life own it all another way of  saying it would be everyone wants change
-xFtboP_loY,3595680,3601599,but no one is willing to start with  themselves  and that is the only place that will
-xFtboP_loY,3601599,3607359,bring change be brave enough to look at  everything you don't like about your  life  not for opinion
-xFtboP_loY,3607359,3614000,but with pride knowing exactly where  you're headed knowing that you're going  to make the changes needed to take your
-xFtboP_loY,3614000,3621599,life where you want to take it knowing  that it's all on you and you wouldn't  have it any other way
-xFtboP_loY,3626079,3632720,step back and take a look at your life  as if from a bird's-eye view as if it  were someone else's life
-xFtboP_loY,3632720,3639359,then pretend you're a wise mentor  what do you need to change now  so that you can create the future you
-xFtboP_loY,3639359,3645680,that you really want to be what are the  big decisions you must make now so you  can live with pride tomorrow
-xFtboP_loY,3645680,3653119,make those changes  [Music]  well if somebody says something out loud
-xFtboP_loY,3653119,3658559,it's 10 times more powerful than if they  think it  and then as we started to study the data
-xFtboP_loY,3658559,3665280,particularly data that was just  reinforced by christine porath from  georgetown and harvard that negativity
-xFtboP_loY,3665280,3671760,is a multiple of four to seven times  more powerful than positivity
-xFtboP_loY,3671760,3678880,so think about that if i say something  out loud it's 10x if it's negative it's  four to seven times more powerful so
-xFtboP_loY,3678880,3684880,when i say negative things out loud it's  40 to 70 times more likely that that
-xFtboP_loY,3684880,3690880,will happen or cause a result that won't  be good for me than if i just didn't say  anything
-xFtboP_loY,3690880,3696799,so as we were going into our second year  at alabama we made a bet what if we  could just get our players to not say
-xFtboP_loY,3696799,3703760,stupid things out loud  what if we could just do that not teach  any element of positive thinking but
-xFtboP_loY,3703760,3710319,eliminate conversations about the heat  complaining about coaches complaining  about circumstances complaining about
-xFtboP_loY,3710319,3716000,situations  verbalizing negativity but we weren't  going to lie to them and say hey be
-xFtboP_loY,3716000,3722559,positive we just taught them the data  and then what we did was some of the  things that you you notice in the book
-xFtboP_loY,3722559,3727920,the stories in and around negativity are  incredible tell us some bill buckner was
-xFtboP_loY,3727920,3734160,one that took my breath away  so so billy buckner who just passed away  recently was an incredible eight-time
-xFtboP_loY,3734160,3741359,gold glove a great baseball player for  the boston red sox  but he made a mistake in sports that
-xFtboP_loY,3741359,3747760,would be one of the biggest sport  bloopers in history and in 1986 he let  the game-winning run score on a ground
-xFtboP_loY,3747760,3753039,ball through his legs that ultimately  would give the mets the world series
-xFtboP_loY,3753039,3758720,now i was just watching an espn e60  jeremy shop story
-xFtboP_loY,3758720,3764240,and i saw an interview that was done in  1990 that resurfaced in 1995 where
-xFtboP_loY,3764240,3770160,buckner was interviewed 12 days before  the world series and he said you know  the dreams are to win
-xFtboP_loY,3770160,3776640,you know to win the world series and the  nightmare would be for me to let the  game-winning run score on a ground ball  through my legs
-xFtboP_loY,3776640,3782480,you know and then ultimately that's  exactly what would happen now by saying  that out loud what did he do he didn't
-xFtboP_loY,3782480,3788240,make it happen but he increased the  probability  and this is what i want people to
-xFtboP_loY,3788240,3793839,understand your internal thoughts are  all over the place do you think that he
-xFtboP_loY,3793839,3800640,makes it more likely because it's going  to subtly influence his behavior or  because you're talking to some magical  deity that then says well you said it
-xFtboP_loY,3800640,3807200,and so i'm gonna make it happen i think  that what he did is a subconscious plant  by verbalizing it and knowing that it's
-xFtboP_loY,3807200,3813920,ten times more powerful he's planting it  in the subconscious he's not he doesn't  want it to happen but it becomes
-xFtboP_loY,3813920,3819440,something that's ultimately on his mind  and he gave it more power by verbalizing
-xFtboP_loY,3819440,3824880,when you refuse  to allow any doubts in your own mind
-xFtboP_loY,3824880,3830319,then no doubts from others will ever  cloud your judgment
-xFtboP_loY,3830319,3837599,when you create a strong mind there can  be no other that will defeat you with  their words or with their judgments
-xFtboP_loY,3837599,3844480,when you  believe in you  you need no other to believe in you
-xFtboP_loY,3844480,3850079,because others  really have no say in who you will  become
-xFtboP_loY,3850079,3856559,only you  have that say  only you can decide if others opinions
-xFtboP_loY,3856559,3861920,become reality or you create your own  fate
-xFtboP_loY,3863760,3870559,the greatest challenge and the greatest  obstacle any human will face is their  own doubts their own fears and their own
-xFtboP_loY,3870559,3875920,conditioned thoughts  if you want to live your dream
-xFtboP_loY,3875920,3882319,you will have to fight for it  you will have to fight the greatest  battles of your life
-xFtboP_loY,3882319,3888640,you will have to battle the external  enemy  people who don't believe in you
-xFtboP_loY,3888640,3895280,people who do you wrong people who put  you down  you will have to battle the intimate
-xFtboP_loY,3895280,3901280,enemy  those close to you who might do you  wrong or maybe you assume
-xFtboP_loY,3901280,3908240,don't believe in you  those who want the best for you but  their idea of support is to remind you
-xFtboP_loY,3908240,3913760,of what can't be done or shouldn't be  attempted  but the worst of all
-xFtboP_loY,3913760,3919039,is the internal enemy  you will have to battle what seems like
-xFtboP_loY,3919039,3926799,an army in your own head an army of  doubt  fear of failure fear of judgment lack of
-xFtboP_loY,3926799,3932880,belief the voices inside the head saying  i am not good enough
-xFtboP_loY,3932880,3939119,i'm not worthy i want to do this but i  can i want to give to those i love but i
-xFtboP_loY,3939119,3944960,can't i'm not worthy of love i'll never  be able to do this i am hopeless i've
-xFtboP_loY,3944960,3951920,tried everything the world is against me  no one believes in me my life's not
-xFtboP_loY,3951920,3957440,worth  living  there is no greater pain that can be
-xFtboP_loY,3957440,3963520,inflicted on you than your own internal  enemy  your own thoughts will cause you more
-xFtboP_loY,3963520,3970160,pain than anyone or anything  they can be likened to a terrorist
-xFtboP_loY,3970160,3977359,living in your soul  but when you learn  to control and direct your mind you can
-xFtboP_loY,3977359,3982559,direct that internal voice to work for  you rather than against you
-xFtboP_loY,3982559,3990480,you get it to work for you by creating a  compelling future  a future you will be proud to achieve
-xFtboP_loY,3990480,3997520,proud to live through  you do this  by not just having goals
-xFtboP_loY,3997520,4004079,but having meaningful goals  goals that get you excited to wake up  every morning
-xFtboP_loY,4004079,4011599,you do this by understanding what your  purpose in life really is  what are you doing in albert
-xFtboP_loY,4011599,4017200,when you know these things  when you work on yourself daily
-xFtboP_loY,4017200,4022640,you can quiet that voice in your head  you can feel good enough
-xFtboP_loY,4022640,4028880,because you are  good enough  [Music]  but it does take a commitment
-xFtboP_loY,4028880,4034079,a commitment of daily practice to work  in yourself
-xFtboP_loY,4034079,4043920,cut out something that you spend a lot  of time on that does nothing good for  your life  and replace it with daily work on you
-xFtboP_loY,4044160,4050160,empower yourself  set your life up to win
-xFtboP_loY,4050880,4056799,well my dad had gone to a toastmasters  early on and heard one of the most  successful magazine entrepreneurs in the
-xFtboP_loY,4056799,4062480,world speak he comes back and tells me i  just had a chance to hear one of the  most successful magazine entrepreneurs
-xFtboP_loY,4062480,4068799,in the world  speak and he said when are you taking  your sat i said i'm taking it next year  he said well this guy was failing out of
-xFtboP_loY,4068799,4074160,high school he was struggling he was  raised by a single mom in the midwest  but he promised his mother he would take
-xFtboP_loY,4074160,4079920,a test called the s.a.t  so he takes the s.a.t in may's junior  year doesn't expect anything now the
-xFtboP_loY,4079920,4085520,s.a.t which i don't know how many your  population know but it's it's a  standardized test with the math part and
-xFtboP_loY,4085520,4091520,a verbal part both are scored out of 800  points well this guy takes it he's  bombing he's failing out of school he
-xFtboP_loY,4091520,4097600,doesn't expect anything as he's telling  the story of toastmasters well he gets a  1480 out of 1600.
-xFtboP_loY,4097600,4102640,so he's stunned right that would be for  the smart people that listened to your  product yeah right cognitive dissonance
-xFtboP_loY,4102640,4108960,i got a 900 on my sats just to give  people a friend right and i got a 10 90  and i got a 10 10 right i was just hey
-xFtboP_loY,4108960,4114798,four days and you you know it's a  variety different things so he gets the  score and his mother doing what any
-xFtboP_loY,4114798,4121520,mother would do knowing her kid says did  you cheat right she knows her son and he  said i swear to god i tried to cheat but
-xFtboP_loY,4121520,4128080,the way the numbers were and the  scantrons and the bubbles you couldn't  cheat so she says you mean to tell me  you really got that score he said yeah i
-xFtboP_loY,4128080,4134000,got the score so he's stunned tom so as  my dad telling me the story i'm like  okay so he says all right so what he
-xFtboP_loY,4134000,4140318,decides is because he realizes he's  smart and he's going into his senior  year he says i'm going to go to class
-xFtboP_loY,4140318,4146560,now he starts to go to class he doesn't  hang out with who he did when he didn't  go to class  all right teachers see them in class and
-xFtboP_loY,4146560,4151920,they said hey maybe franklin pierce  maybe we missed the boat on this kid so  they start to treat him differently well
-xFtboP_loY,4151920,4158640,as the guy would tell the story he  graduates goes to a community college  goes on to wichita state goes under the  ivy league and becomes this massively
-xFtboP_loY,4158640,4163920,successful magazine entrepreneur so i  said okay well the guy was always smart  he just needed a standardized test to
-xFtboP_loY,4163920,4170880,unlock it my dad said no that's not the  story this is what i want you to  understand  he said 12 years after all this guy's
-xFtboP_loY,4170880,4176238,success he gets a letter in the mail  from princeton new jersey doesn't think  anything about it the next day his wife
-xFtboP_loY,4176238,4183199,says you're going to open it he opens it  true story turns out the sat board will  periodically review their test taking
-xFtboP_loY,4183199,4190238,procedures and the policies the year he  took the test he was one of 13 people  sent the wrong s.a.t score
-xFtboP_loY,4190238,4195600,his actual score was a 740 out of 1600.
-xFtboP_loY,4195600,4200800,and he said people think my whole life  changed when i got to 1480.  but what happened my whole life changed
-xFtboP_loY,4200800,4206560,when i started acting like a 1480 and  what does a 1480 do he goes to class
-xFtboP_loY,4206560,4212159,well this is one of the first stories i  would share when i had my opportunity at  alabama or florida state or georgia so a
-xFtboP_loY,4212159,4218080,your language is powerful but number two  your behavior is way ahead of your  success
-xFtboP_loY,4218080,4223679,and so many people let their feelings  dictate what they do as opposed to throw
-xFtboP_loY,4223679,4231040,your behavior out there russell wilson's  510 he shouldn't be playing pro football  but he behaves like the best quarterback
-xFtboP_loY,4231040,4238000,in the country and he's done that since  before he was at that level and then his  feelings and emotions and his skill
-xFtboP_loY,4238000,4244000,caught up to that behavior i think the  lesson my dad was trying to teach me  ultimately was in addition to my
-xFtboP_loY,4244000,4252159,language what i do  not how i feel about my past is going to  determine who i am in the future
-xFtboP_loY,4255040,4262480,there's no such thing as not having  enough time  there's only what you make as a priority
-xFtboP_loY,4262480,4269280,you make the time for what you must have  you make the time for the people you  want to be around
-xFtboP_loY,4269280,4273840,you make the time  for your must
-xFtboP_loY,4274640,4281119,if you need to sacrifice for something  you must have in your life you will make  that sacrifice
-xFtboP_loY,4281199,4287440,if it's not a priority you won't work  for it and you'll never have it
-xFtboP_loY,4287440,4294159,there's no such thing as not having  enough money the world is full of money  if you want it bad enough you will find
-xFtboP_loY,4294159,4301280,a way to get it  if you want money to start your business  you will find an investor you will find
-xFtboP_loY,4301280,4307120,a loan you will find many loans and you  will work two jobs three times you will

-xFtboP_loY,4312400,4320719,listen to these words and listen closely  whatever you must  you will whatever you must do you will
-xFtboP_loY,4320719,4326719,do there's no doubting that statement  your life right now represents all the
-xFtboP_loY,4326719,4334239,things you've made a priority if you're  like most you've probably only made  survival a priority getting by paying
-xFtboP_loY,4334239,4340880,the bills doing the minimum i choose not  to live that way i choose to do more i
-xFtboP_loY,4340880,4346800,choose to be more  [Music]  there's no such thing as a lack of
-xFtboP_loY,4346800,4352480,education  self-education has made more  millionaires than school ever will
-xFtboP_loY,4352480,4359520,there's only what you make as a priority  there's no such thing as talent hard  work would always be talent but do you
-xFtboP_loY,4359520,4365199,want it bad enough or are you too lazy  to work for  so you fall back on excuses
-xFtboP_loY,4365199,4370960,like  there's no such thing as lack of  opportunity opportunity is everywhere if
-xFtboP_loY,4370960,4379040,you believe you will reach your  definition of success opportunity will  show up everywhere everywhere you look
-xFtboP_loY,4379040,4385360,i choose to make a priority in my life  big dreams and things i must have i must
-xFtboP_loY,4385360,4390719,have great help i must have abundance i  must set an example
-xFtboP_loY,4390719,4397199,an example to my family an example to  anyone who crosses my path an example of
-xFtboP_loY,4397199,4406480,i can  an example of when i say something i do  it an example of nothing is impossible
-xFtboP_loY,4406480,4412239,nothing is off limits  there's no truth to statements like you

-xFtboP_loY,4417360,4422960,if health and energy are your priority  you will find a way to get the right  diet
-xFtboP_loY,4422960,4428960,to write appropriate and you will push  yourself until you get to that level you  must get to
-xFtboP_loY,4428960,4434000,there's no such thing as you don't have  time  you make time for the things that are
-xFtboP_loY,4434000,4439440,your priority to you  the people the things you believe you  must do

-xFtboP_loY,4489600,4494719,you think about what it's going to cost  more than what it's worth  is your dream worth the price you must
-xFtboP_loY,4494719,4502159,pay to get it  and my leg said  successful people don't negotiate price
-xFtboP_loY,4502159,4508239,they negotiate worth  is your dream worth the price you must  pay to get it
-xFtboP_loY,4508239,4515199,the sacrifice the long days  the early mornings  in the late nights
-xFtboP_loY,4515199,4522239,the lonely roads the effort the failures  the embarrassment  is the end result worth the pain
