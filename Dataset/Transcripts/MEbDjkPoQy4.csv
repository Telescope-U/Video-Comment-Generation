MEbDjkPoQy4,12539,13802,"I live in LA,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,13802,17205,and I'm a fashion designer and a Renaissance woman.
MEbDjkPoQy4,17205,20846,"My fashion style is based on how I feel, really."
MEbDjkPoQy4,20846,23822,"So some of the staples in my closet, they're very eclectic."
MEbDjkPoQy4,23822,28192,"It's a spectrum, 'cause I have T-shirts to fur coats."
MEbDjkPoQy4,28192,29803,I got into kilts last year.
MEbDjkPoQy4,29804,31260,So I think I got this.
MEbDjkPoQy4,31260,34186,"Today, I'm looking for confidence."
MEbDjkPoQy4,34186,35808,A different style doesn't hurt.
MEbDjkPoQy4,35808,37107,"I'm not looking for the same thing as me,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,37108,38540,but something that can complement me
MEbDjkPoQy4,38540,41400,"and really inspire me to be like, ""Hmm""."

MEbDjkPoQy4,52799,56546,I would describe my style as kind of moody.
MEbDjkPoQy4,56546,58938,I really dress based off of how I feel.
MEbDjkPoQy4,58938,62564,I really like patterns and texture and color.
MEbDjkPoQy4,62564,64748,"A little razzle dazzle, that's the vibe."
MEbDjkPoQy4,64748,67296,"I mean, I think I should win because it's a great outfit."
MEbDjkPoQy4,67296,70519,"It showcases personality, a little booty cuff."

MEbDjkPoQy4,79804,81193,I always start with my shoes
MEbDjkPoQy4,81193,83676,"because you gotta have a fresh pair of kicks,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,83676,86928,and then always a T-shirt because it's just comfy and cute.
MEbDjkPoQy4,86928,91891,"They should choose my outfit because it's cute, once again,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,91891,93310,and you know I'm comfy

MEbDjkPoQy4,96818,98117,"I'm from South Central LA,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,98117,101862,and I am a barista/retail associate.
MEbDjkPoQy4,101862,104254,"My style is very fun, colorful."
MEbDjkPoQy4,104254,105464,It honestly depends on the day.
MEbDjkPoQy4,105464,108285,Sometimes I like to dress more masculine than feminine.
MEbDjkPoQy4,108286,110388,"When they see my outfit, they're gonna be like,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,110388,111613,"""That's different""."
MEbDjkPoQy4,111613,114266,My outfit should win because it's fly
MEbDjkPoQy4,114266,116190,"and I think individuality is important in style,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,116190,118773,so I think that it shows that I'm very individualistic.
MEbDjkPoQy4,118773,120884,"- All right, let's get into these fits."
MEbDjkPoQy4,120884,122310,Outfit number one.

MEbDjkPoQy4,137539,138487,It says a lot about somebody
MEbDjkPoQy4,138487,141903,that can wear something that's bright.
MEbDjkPoQy4,141903,143658,"- Okay, work."
MEbDjkPoQy4,143658,144765,- Is this a romper?
MEbDjkPoQy4,144765,145842,I think it's a romper.
MEbDjkPoQy4,145842,148338,This tells me that she likes vintage stuff.
MEbDjkPoQy4,148339,150104,"- Got the compliments rolling, feed me more."

MEbDjkPoQy4,152759,154319,"Let's see how you're putting the piecing together,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,154319,157103,'cause accessories are important.
MEbDjkPoQy4,157103,158661,"These are nice, classy."
MEbDjkPoQy4,158661,159676,"I guess there's two levels,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,159676,162407,so maybe that means there might be two ear holes.
MEbDjkPoQy4,162408,164900,Curious to see where these holes are placed.
MEbDjkPoQy4,164900,167230,- That was an interesting statement.
MEbDjkPoQy4,167230,170478,"- I am into purses, and I do like to admire a good purse."
MEbDjkPoQy4,170478,173168,"- Just don't open it, some stuff might fall out."
MEbDjkPoQy4,173169,174739,"- Ooh, ooh I like this."

MEbDjkPoQy4,193161,195056,"- I like these, these are pretty funky."
MEbDjkPoQy4,195057,198347,"They're cool, and looks pretty multi-function."
MEbDjkPoQy4,198347,200011,"You could wear 'em on a hike,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,200011,202649,"and then you can just switch your shirt, wear 'em on a date."
MEbDjkPoQy4,202649,205821,- Or I could also step on somebody if I need to.
MEbDjkPoQy4,205821,208681,- I like the fun energy of this look.
MEbDjkPoQy4,208681,212972,It seems also very thought out but still effortless.

MEbDjkPoQy4,214519,216778,"- Okay, let's move on to outfit number two."

MEbDjkPoQy4,241677,243913,"- It feels like some important things,"
MEbDjkPoQy4,243913,246187,something that could probably knock somebody out.
