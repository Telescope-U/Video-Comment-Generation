awMAB60fnXk,2560,4960,of occupying russian forces stealing
awMAB60fnXk,4960,7839,thousands of tons of ukrainian grain the
awMAB60fnXk,7839,10719,un is warning a famine in africa and the
awMAB60fnXk,10719,12559,middle east because of the disruption to
awMAB60fnXk,12559,14880,supplies from ukraine which is one of
awMAB60fnXk,14880,16960,the world's biggest wheat producers
awMAB60fnXk,16960,19600,moscow denies accusations of theft but
awMAB60fnXk,19600,21760,russian installed authorities have been
awMAB60fnXk,21760,24480,found to be issuing decrees saying they
awMAB60fnXk,24480,27680,are nationalizing ukrainian grain well
awMAB60fnXk,27680,29679,let's talk to our correspondent nick
awMAB60fnXk,29679,34640,beak who joins us live from kiev nick
awMAB60fnXk,36559,38160,good morning sally yes it's been a
awMAB60fnXk,38160,40320,weekend of missiles hitting this capital
awMAB60fnXk,40320,43040,city a reminder that the
awMAB60fnXk,43040,45840,powers that be in moscow continue to hit
awMAB60fnXk,45840,47920,this city even though the fiercest
awMAB60fnXk,47920,50559,fighting is raging in the east of
awMAB60fnXk,50559,52559,ukraine at the same time for months now
awMAB60fnXk,52559,54320,we've been hearing about the theft
awMAB60fnXk,54320,57920,alleged theft of ukrainian grain by the
awMAB60fnXk,57920,60960,russian occupying authorities it can be
awMAB60fnXk,60960,62480,hard to prove but we've gathered
awMAB60fnXk,62480,64878,evidence together that shows the level
awMAB60fnXk,64878,66799,of this theft and this is our
awMAB60fnXk,66799,69439,investigation
awMAB60fnXk,69520,72159,russian forces in ukraine are accused of
awMAB60fnXk,72159,73439,war crimes
awMAB60fnXk,73439,75360,murder and rape
awMAB60fnXk,75360,77119,but they're also accused of stealing
awMAB60fnXk,77119,80880,ukrainian grain on an industrial scale
awMAB60fnXk,80880,83280,they destroyed our premises destroyed
awMAB60fnXk,83280,86000,our equipment everything they saw
awMAB60fnXk,86000,88479,everything they touched disappears
awMAB60fnXk,88479,90720,we tried to contact more than 200
awMAB60fnXk,90720,93200,farmers whose land is now in russian
awMAB60fnXk,93200,96159,occupied territory the vast majority
awMAB60fnXk,96159,98560,were too scared to talk but one did
awMAB60fnXk,98560,100720,agree to be interviewed to protect his
awMAB60fnXk,100720,103119,identity we've changed his name and are
awMAB60fnXk,103119,104960,using an actor
awMAB60fnXk,104960,107759,they looted our offices even pulled the
awMAB60fnXk,107759,109520,wiring from the walls and took away the
awMAB60fnXk,109520,113200,photographs of our relatives
awMAB60fnXk,113200,114960,and this was the moment the russians
awMAB60fnXk,114960,117439,arrived at the farm you can see their
awMAB60fnXk,117439,119680,zed symbol on the tanks
awMAB60fnXk,119680,121759,one soldier tries to shoot the security
awMAB60fnXk,121759,123680,camera but misses
awMAB60fnXk,123680,125920,thousands of tons of grain were then
awMAB60fnXk,125920,130160,taken and transported in stolen lorries
awMAB60fnXk,130160,132640,using its gps tracker we followed the
awMAB60fnXk,132640,135440,route of one truck travelling to crimea
awMAB60fnXk,135440,137840,which moscow annexed eight years ago and
awMAB60fnXk,137840,140319,then onto mainland russia where it's
awMAB60fnXk,140319,143040,feared ukrainian grain is being packed
awMAB60fnXk,143040,146160,up and exported as russian grain
awMAB60fnXk,146160,148400,on the way the truck stopped here at
awMAB60fnXk,148400,151040,this grain store where a new zed symbol
awMAB60fnXk,151040,153680,has appeared on the roof
awMAB60fnXk,153680,156000,ukrainian officials fear the russians
awMAB60fnXk,156000,158160,have stolen as much as eight hundred
awMAB60fnXk,158160,160319,thousand tons of grain since the
awMAB60fnXk,160319,161440,invasion
awMAB60fnXk,161440,163519,it's bringing back memories of the great
awMAB60fnXk,163519,165920,famine that joseph stalin inflicted on
awMAB60fnXk,165920,169440,this country nearly a century ago
awMAB60fnXk,169440,172080,ukraine's flag tells you all you need to
awMAB60fnXk,172080,175680,know a blue sky over a yellow field
awMAB60fnXk,175680,178000,encapsulates just how important this
awMAB60fnXk,178000,181040,fertile land is to people it's the soul
awMAB60fnXk,181040,183120,of the country and so the russian
awMAB60fnXk,183120,186560,occupation and theft of ukrainian grain
awMAB60fnXk,186560,189120,has a profound effect on people here but
awMAB60fnXk,189120,191120,it's also having increasingly grave
awMAB60fnXk,191120,193760,consequences for people in other parts
awMAB60fnXk,193760,196000,of the world too
awMAB60fnXk,196000,197760,the russians are destroying us as a
awMAB60fnXk,197760,200239,nation as people who strive for freedom
awMAB60fnXk,200239,201440,and work
awMAB60fnXk,201440,203760,they don't want us to have this land to
awMAB60fnXk,203760,206959,earn from this land
awMAB60fnXk,207440,209760,grain that isn't being robbed is being
awMAB60fnXk,209760,212319,destroyed this footage posted by the
awMAB60fnXk,212319,214480,ukrainian military is said to show
awMAB60fnXk,214480,217680,russian forces blowing up a grain store
awMAB60fnXk,217680,220560,moscow denies its destroying or robbing
awMAB60fnXk,220560,222319,ukrainian produce
awMAB60fnXk,222319,225200,but instead it claims it's nationalizing
awMAB60fnXk,225200,226959,ukraine's grain
awMAB60fnXk,226959,229280,we obtained one document from a russian
awMAB60fnXk,229280,231680,installed authority that says to ensure
awMAB60fnXk,231680,233920,the food security of the area there's
awMAB60fnXk,233920,235760,now an order to take the wheat and
awMAB60fnXk,235760,238840,barley from the warehouse of a
awMAB60fnXk,238840,240480,company
awMAB60fnXk,240480,242319,i think there are so many people in the
awMAB60fnXk,242319,245040,world now sitting eating a sandwich not
awMAB60fnXk,245040,247360,realizing that this grain has been
awMAB60fnXk,247360,249680,stolen and that so many people are
awMAB60fnXk,249680,250879,suffering
awMAB60fnXk,250879,252959,i don't understand why the world is
awMAB60fnXk,252959,255599,silent and not doing anything to punish
awMAB60fnXk,255599,258079,this injustice
awMAB60fnXk,258079,260799,the wholesale theft of ukrainian grain
awMAB60fnXk,260799,263600,threatens to [ __ ] this vital sector
awMAB60fnXk,263600,266880,of an economy already under such strain
awMAB60fnXk,266880,269280,a russian crime targeting individual
awMAB60fnXk,269280,272639,farmers will be felt by a whole nation
awMAB60fnXk,272639,275680,and beyond
awMAB60fnXk,277199,278479,well at this time of year they'd be
awMAB60fnXk,278479,280400,harvesting the fields here in ukraine
awMAB60fnXk,280400,282400,but it's simply not possible in so many
awMAB60fnXk,282400,285040,areas this year of course those are
awMAB60fnXk,285040,287919,under occupation so many of those areas
awMAB60fnXk,287919,290560,also a lot of the workers have fled some
awMAB60fnXk,290560,292960,of the fields have now been mined so
awMAB60fnXk,292960,294960,huge concerns about what will be taken
awMAB60fnXk,294960,296639,from the ground this year and of course
awMAB60fnXk,296639,297759,it's something sally that's being
awMAB60fnXk,297759,300080,discussed by those g7 leaders today it's
awMAB60fnXk,300080,301520,not just the impact that vladimir
awMAB60fnXk,301520,302960,putin's invasion's having on this
awMAB60fnXk,302960,305520,country but it's the ramifications far
awMAB60fnXk,305520,307918,beyond
