eTHio_Paf7o,80,1520,so i wanted to show you how and why you
eTHio_Paf7o,1520,3439,should tape your paintings down but
eTHio_Paf7o,3439,5759,literally nothing went according to plan
eTHio_Paf7o,5759,7120,first let's talk about why you need to
eTHio_Paf7o,7120,8559,tape your paintings down there's two
eTHio_Paf7o,8559,10160,reasons one you get a really nice clean
eTHio_Paf7o,10160,12160,edge look at that and two watercolor
eTHio_Paf7o,12160,13599,mainly the water part will make your
eTHio_Paf7o,13599,15839,paper buckle and bend yikes tape will
eTHio_Paf7o,15839,17359,keep your art nice and flat so that's
eTHio_Paf7o,17359,18560,why we use it but what kind of tape
eTHio_Paf7o,18560,19760,works best you ask let's see what
eTHio_Paf7o,19760,21119,happens when we use plain old scotch
eTHio_Paf7o,21119,22240,tape it's not made for something like
eTHio_Paf7o,22240,23439,this so which either rip the paper or
eTHio_Paf7o,23439,24960,the paint should bleed through that or
eTHio_Paf7o,24960,26880,oh that actually doesn't look so bad
eTHio_Paf7o,26880,28000,let's try the painters tape that you
eTHio_Paf7o,28000,29359,would get from a hardware store it's not
eTHio_Paf7o,29359,30960,made for the delicacy that's watercolor
eTHio_Paf7o,30960,32000,paper and my experience is that
eTHio_Paf7o,32000,33680,watercolor will bleed through and nope
eTHio_Paf7o,33680,35520,that actually came out okay too wow i
eTHio_Paf7o,35520,36960,see lots of you using washi tape i've
eTHio_Paf7o,36960,38399,never tried it before but fortunately my
eTHio_Paf7o,38399,39840,wife loves it and gave me something to
eTHio_Paf7o,39840,41200,play with look at the little artist
eTHio_Paf7o,41200,43200,squirrel in his little artist easel this
eTHio_Paf7o,43200,45360,this actually did pretty good too
eTHio_Paf7o,45360,46960,now i use professional tape it's amazing
eTHio_Paf7o,46960,48480,i get it at my local art store it's like
eTHio_Paf7o,48480,50719,12 a roll it's the best it never rips my
eTHio_Paf7o,50719,53600,paper and it never bleed ah crap really
eTHio_Paf7o,53600,55360,well there goes 30 years of art down the
eTHio_Paf7o,55360,57120,toilet use whatever you want to i don't
eTHio_Paf7o,57120,59199,know what i'm doing my whole life is a
eTHio_Paf7o,59199,61760,lie
