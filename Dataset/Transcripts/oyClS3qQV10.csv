oyClS3qQV10,240,4490,- This is the best gaming laptop in existence
oyClS3qQV10,5940,9393,"and I'll bet money, nothing will top it in 2022."
oyClS3qQV10,10770,12850,There are great gaming laptops
oyClS3qQV10,12850,15470,and there are great laptops period.
oyClS3qQV10,15470,18720,The Asus Zephyrus G14 hopes to be both
oyClS3qQV10,18720,19810,but have they done enough
oyClS3qQV10,19810,22760,to justify the sphincter-tightening price tag?
oyClS3qQV10,22760,24730,And can I justify using the word sphincter
oyClS3qQV10,24730,26359,in my segue to our sponsor?
oyClS3qQV10,26360,28670,Thank you TrueCoders for sponsoring this video.
oyClS3qQV10,28670,29870,"With their coding bootcamp,"
oyClS3qQV10,29870,31340,you can go from flipping burgers
oyClS3qQV10,31340,33530,to flipping bits in nine short weeks.
oyClS3qQV10,33530,35280,Join the other TrueCoders graduates
oyClS3qQV10,35280,36590,who have started their new career
oyClS3qQV10,36590,39370,in the lucrative and stimulating field of programming
oyClS3qQV10,39370,43613,at truecoders.io/ltt.
oyClS3qQV10,44884,47467,(upbeat music)
oyClS3qQV10,51270,54170,"Inside the 2022 Zephyrus G14,"
oyClS3qQV10,54170,57623,"we get an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS,"
oyClS3qQV10,57624,61550,"32GB of RAM, a terabyte of storage and most interestingly,"
oyClS3qQV10,61550,64820,an AMD Radeon RX 6800S.
oyClS3qQV10,64820,69250,"Compared to the outgoing G14, the 2022 model just shreds it,"
oyClS3qQV10,69250,70340,not even fair.
oyClS3qQV10,70340,72450,"In fact, I'm stopping the graphs right now"
oyClS3qQV10,72450,74930,because you don't need to see any more of this beat down.
oyClS3qQV10,74930,77400,The new one is faster. Big whoop.
oyClS3qQV10,77400,80560,But to really show off what an excellent job Asus has done
oyClS3qQV10,80560,81970,"with this whole package,"
oyClS3qQV10,81970,85030,we need to compare it to a laptop that is faster.
oyClS3qQV10,85030,88420,This right here is the Alienware X15
oyClS3qQV10,88420,90820,and it is an engineering marvel.
oyClS3qQV10,90820,94120,It is just 15.9 millimeters thin
oyClS3qQV10,94120,98900,but it's able to cool RTX 3080 and an Intel i7.
oyClS3qQV10,98900,100770,"Even rocking the last gen processor,"
oyClS3qQV10,100770,104130,the X15 was able to consistently beat the G14.
oyClS3qQV10,104130,105880,"In gaming benchmarks, the X15"
oyClS3qQV10,105880,108719,took enough of a lead for you to notice the difference
oyClS3qQV10,108720,112030,"not just by the numbers, but in gameplay too."
oyClS3qQV10,112030,113560,How was Alienware able to achieve
oyClS3qQV10,113560,116610,this thermodynamic wizardry? One moment.
oyClS3qQV10,116610,120380,The whole laptop is designed around the cooling solution.
oyClS3qQV10,120380,121960,So it has a small motherboard
oyClS3qQV10,121960,124030,to make room for these four fans.
oyClS3qQV10,124030,125460,The keyboard was lowered
oyClS3qQV10,125460,127970,so that we could have these fin stacks up here.
oyClS3qQV10,127970,129850,And they even went so far as they designed their own
oyClS3qQV10,129850,132990,special liquid metal called Element 31.
oyClS3qQV10,132990,134710,We've showed that that significantly
oyClS3qQV10,134710,136450,outperforms another liquid metal
oyClS3qQV10,136450,139330,and too bad using it sucks.
oyClS3qQV10,139330,141610,"Like, look, they lowered the keyboard"
oyClS3qQV10,141610,143600,and now my hand falls off the edge.
oyClS3qQV10,143600,144870,I can't game all this comfortably
oyClS3qQV10,144870,147349,for more than like three minutes.
oyClS3qQV10,147350,148183,Sure.
oyClS3qQV10,148183,149319,Stupid.
oyClS3qQV10,149320,152330,"Yes. In any design, there will be trade offs"
oyClS3qQV10,152330,155450,but the G14 balances them all perfectly.
oyClS3qQV10,155450,157650,"Instead of making it wide to accommodate intakes,"
oyClS3qQV10,157650,159750,they just lifted up the chassis.
oyClS3qQV10,159750,162310,The hot air does blow directly into the screen
oyClS3qQV10,162310,164910,but I'm not concerned about the temps it reaches.
oyClS3qQV10,164910,167730,"It's clear the keyboard, track pad and screen"
oyClS3qQV10,167730,169440,"were the priorities here,"
oyClS3qQV10,169440,172580,"aka, the bits that matter most when you use a laptop."
oyClS3qQV10,172580,174490,"In fact, the screen is just a great example"
oyClS3qQV10,174490,177300,of the G14 targeting what you actually want.
oyClS3qQV10,177300,180560,Sure. The alien wear has three times the refresh rate
oyClS3qQV10,180560,183090,but most of us aren't professional head clickers.
oyClS3qQV10,183090,186720,"With the G14, we get a 2560 by 1600p screen."
oyClS3qQV10,186720,188610,That's fast enough for most gamers
oyClS3qQV10,188610,190980,while being bright and color accurate enough
oyClS3qQV10,190980,193080,for video or photo editors.
oyClS3qQV10,193080,195030,I can do my job writing scripts on it
oyClS3qQV10,195030,197700,and not wish I was using a professional laptop instead.
oyClS3qQV10,197700,199500,"Oh, and on the top, they even added a webcam"
oyClS3qQV10,199500,201330,with Windows Hello Facial Recognition.
oyClS3qQV10,201330,204010,Very glad you finally yielded to me yelling about
oyClS3qQV10,204010,206180,not having webcam basis.
oyClS3qQV10,206180,207400,It's actually not half bad.
oyClS3qQV10,207400,210849,The user inputs on the G14 are exceptional.
oyClS3qQV10,210850,211760,This track pad.
oyClS3qQV10,211760,214013,"Just, just look at it, it's just,"
oyClS3qQV10,215370,218209,"big, accurate, and it feels great."
oyClS3qQV10,218210,220410,"In my opinion, this is the best track pad"
oyClS3qQV10,220410,222830,on a gaming laptop and an easy a.
oyClS3qQV10,222830,224430,I barely wished I had a mouse
oyClS3qQV10,224430,226390,when I was doing non-gaming tasks.
oyClS3qQV10,226390,228250,The keyboard is also a standout.
oyClS3qQV10,228250,230367,With key travel that's soft
oyClS3qQV10,230367,232580,and doesn't require too much force
oyClS3qQV10,232580,235860,"so, great for gaming, but it still retains enough"
oyClS3qQV10,235860,239640,of a tactile bump to be functional for very quick typing.
oyClS3qQV10,239640,242690,"Awesome. There's almost no deck flex,"
oyClS3qQV10,242690,244540,thanks to magnesium chassis.
oyClS3qQV10,244540,248450,"In fact, the whole laptop is just super well built."
oyClS3qQV10,248450,250819,The keycaps have this sparkly color shift
oyClS3qQV10,250820,252820,you can only see at certain angles.
oyClS3qQV10,252820,253959,The Animatrix on the back
oyClS3qQV10,253959,257329,comments from everyone that passed by my desk
oyClS3qQV10,257329,259332,and it is white.
oyClS3qQV10,264940,267110,Wow. That was actually really anticlimatic.
oyClS3qQV10,267110,269050,I was expecting the Cheetos dust to stick.
oyClS3qQV10,269050,271190,"But you could like, oh my God."
oyClS3qQV10,271190,273363,"It's so stupid, Mark. Why did we do this?"
oyClS3qQV10,275510,276483,It's just gone.
oyClS3qQV10,278740,279853,That's really gross.
oyClS3qQV10,280700,282600,"Anyway, audio test."
oyClS3qQV10,282600,283480,"Okay, here we go."
oyClS3qQV10,283480,287573,"Sound test versus the king of Windows laptop audio, XPS 15."
oyClS3qQV10,291290,293440,It's kinda lacking in bass. Let's see here.
oyClS3qQV10,297928,298893,- [Mark] It does.
oyClS3qQV10,298893,299726,- Yeah.
oyClS3qQV10,300850,303410,"The Dell's better but at the same time,"
oyClS3qQV10,303410,305260,this right here is pretty impressive.
oyClS3qQV10,307770,309340,"It's not as loud, not as much bass"
oyClS3qQV10,309340,311510,but it's clear and I don't hate it.
oyClS3qQV10,311510,314550,Great laptops also need great IO.
oyClS3qQV10,314550,316779,"And on this, well, you won't be in dongle hell"
oyClS3qQV10,316779,318500,it isn't perfect either.
oyClS3qQV10,318500,321990,"On the left, we get a headphone/microphone combo jack,"
oyClS3qQV10,321990,323169,USB-C type 4
oyClS3qQV10,323170,325100,and HDMI 2.0b.
oyClS3qQV10,325100,328080,"On the right, we get micro SD, another Type-C"
oyClS3qQV10,328080,330970,and two really good reasons to get a wireless mouse
oyClS3qQV10,330970,332903,because this is terrible.
oyClS3qQV10,334380,335725,One thing I was really curious about
oyClS3qQV10,335725,339330,is if the USB-4 ports would work with Thunderbolt devices.
oyClS3qQV10,339330,343150,Thunderbolt 4 is essentially the same thing as USB-4
oyClS3qQV10,343150,345460,but with all of the optional boxes checked off.
oyClS3qQV10,345460,348819,"This Thunderbolt dock right here from Dell, plug it in."
oyClS3qQV10,348820,349710,Okay. Awesome.
oyClS3qQV10,349710,351990,Everything's working. Great.
oyClS3qQV10,351990,353410,"Come over here,"
oyClS3qQV10,353410,358020,we have got this 10-gig network adapter and no such luck.
oyClS3qQV10,358020,361360,"Basically, if you get this message right here,"
oyClS3qQV10,361360,362193,you're screwed.
oyClS3qQV10,362193,363026,Am I testing?
oyClS3qQV10,363026,365670,"It's a coin toss if Thunderbolt devices work or not,"
oyClS3qQV10,365670,369210,"So, if you've got a couple already around, best of luck."
oyClS3qQV10,369210,372690,"In my review of the AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS,"
oyClS3qQV10,372690,375000,the battery life results of the G14
oyClS3qQV10,375000,377610,were a huge improvement over last gen.
oyClS3qQV10,377610,380689,"Nearly doubling from five hours, 42 minutes"
oyClS3qQV10,380690,383600,"to 11 hours, 11 minutes."
oyClS3qQV10,383600,386750,"Other reviewers though, didn't see as much of a jump."
oyClS3qQV10,386750,390060,And it turns out that's because AMD has new AV1 decoders.
oyClS3qQV10,390060,392350,These basically allow the integrated GPU
oyClS3qQV10,392350,394680,to playback supported videos using hardware
oyClS3qQV10,394680,397310,making whole process way more efficient.
oyClS3qQV10,397310,400030,"Office tasks don't see quite as big of an improvement,"
oyClS3qQV10,400030,401400,"so depending on your use case,"
oyClS3qQV10,401400,403780,11 hours isn't reasonable to expect.
oyClS3qQV10,403780,405910,But like eight hours from a gaming laptop
oyClS3qQV10,405910,407440,is still super impressive.
oyClS3qQV10,407440,408710,One thing that intrigued me though
oyClS3qQV10,408710,411741,is the sheer power of the integrated GPU on this laptop.
oyClS3qQV10,411741,412910,RDNA 2.
oyClS3qQV10,412910,416190,"Being from Nova Scotia, It takes eight hours to fly home"
oyClS3qQV10,416190,419330,and it would be really nice to be able to game on the plane.
oyClS3qQV10,419330,421560,"If I could use the APU on this,"
oyClS3qQV10,421560,423639,is it able to game for multiple hours?
oyClS3qQV10,423640,426290,"To test this, I disabled the dedicated GPU,"
oyClS3qQV10,426290,428270,"set a frame limit to 60 FPS,"
oyClS3qQV10,428270,431330,have the refresh rate and turn down the brightness.
oyClS3qQV10,431330,435750,How long can it run F1 2021 at 1080p on low settings?
oyClS3qQV10,435750,439770,Surely longer than the old model with RTX 3060 enabled.
oyClS3qQV10,439770,440680,Right?
oyClS3qQV10,440680,442350,No. The old Zephyrus won the battle
oyClS3qQV10,442350,444740,but the staggering battery lifetime of
oyClS3qQV10,445790,447740,59 minutes.
oyClS3qQV10,447740,449319,I'm disappointed.
oyClS3qQV10,449320,452580,But at least you could buy a 60-watt Type-C charger
oyClS3qQV10,452580,454289,to trickle charge on the plane.
oyClS3qQV10,454290,455630,"Stock power bricks,"
oyClS3qQV10,455630,457780,they use too much power and just shuts off.
oyClS3qQV10,457780,460650,"Keeping up the disappointment train, pricing."
oyClS3qQV10,460650,462590,The 2022 G14
oyClS3qQV10,462590,463610,starts
oyClS3qQV10,463610,465646,"at $1,650."
oyClS3qQV10,465647,469820,"$50 more than the top-of-the-line, 2021 version."
oyClS3qQV10,469820,472230,"And the one we've been testing right here,"
oyClS3qQV10,472230,475113,"2,500 US dollars."
oyClS3qQV10,476560,478860,Asus has a number of good reasons
oyClS3qQV10,478860,480610,the new model is more expensive.
oyClS3qQV10,480610,484949,"And the bump in GP performance is pretty extreme but, damn."
oyClS3qQV10,484950,488140,And it's so expensive to get more than 16GB of RAM.
oyClS3qQV10,488140,489460,"With that in mind,"
oyClS3qQV10,489460,493220,how easy is it to upgrade or repair yourself?
oyClS3qQV10,493220,494530,I don't normally do this but I'm actually
oyClS3qQV10,494530,496800,gonna put on an anti-static wristband today.
oyClS3qQV10,496800,497840,There's been a cold snap
oyClS3qQV10,497840,500510,and I have been shocking just everything I touched
oyClS3qQV10,500510,502000,and it would really suck to kill this.
oyClS3qQV10,502000,505270,Strike number one are these little rubber things
oyClS3qQV10,505270,507400,that you have to take out to get at the screws.
oyClS3qQV10,507400,509863,That sucks cause these never go back in properly.
oyClS3qQV10,519440,520273,"Oh, wow."
oyClS3qQV10,520273,522300,That vapor chamber is so sick.
oyClS3qQV10,522300,524560,"No, this is all vapor chamber. Yeah."
oyClS3qQV10,524560,528560,Like from here all the way over seems so cool.
oyClS3qQV10,528560,530370,Here's our 76whr battery.
oyClS3qQV10,530370,532360,I haven't having issues with it just turning on
oyClS3qQV10,532360,533193,for no reason.
oyClS3qQV10,533193,534770,I'm sure that'll get fixed soon
oyClS3qQV10,534770,537440,but I am just gonna remove that before we go any deeper.
oyClS3qQV10,537440,540050,Right here we have our SODIMM slot.
oyClS3qQV10,540050,542940,So this right here is a 16GB stick.
oyClS3qQV10,542940,545850,The other half of your memory is soldered to the board.
oyClS3qQV10,545850,548139,"That means that if you get the 16GB version,"
oyClS3qQV10,548140,550370,"you get 24GB of RAM,"
oyClS3qQV10,550370,551339,not 32.
oyClS3qQV10,551340,553730,Here's our 1TB SSD.
oyClS3qQV10,553730,555279,It looks pretty generic
oyClS3qQV10,555280,558240,but it does have a fizzing controller on it.
oyClS3qQV10,558240,560720,So it is pretty good I think.
oyClS3qQV10,560720,562509,"Along with the RAM and the SSD,"
oyClS3qQV10,562510,567363,"it looks like your WiFi module, a battery, speakers and fans"
oyClS3qQV10,567363,571910,"all can be pretty easily replaced with minimal, you know,"
oyClS3qQV10,571910,574089,invasion to the laptop.
oyClS3qQV10,574090,575180,Let's go a little bit deeper though
oyClS3qQV10,575180,576430,and see what we can find.
oyClS3qQV10,580270,583880,Getting this vapor chamber off is not particularly easy.
oyClS3qQV10,583880,585730,Although because it does come with liquid metal
oyClS3qQV10,585730,586610,"from the factory,"
oyClS3qQV10,586610,589890,I don't really know why you would ever need to.
oyClS3qQV10,589890,592470,Well what an absolute chunker of vapor chamber.
oyClS3qQV10,592470,595209,But we also see here is that they used thermal paste
oyClS3qQV10,595210,596950,on all of the VRMs
oyClS3qQV10,596950,598410,which means that you don't have to worry
oyClS3qQV10,598410,600560,about like thermal pad thickness.
oyClS3qQV10,600560,602400,I'm surprised they can cool this much
oyClS3qQV10,602400,605770,"with these small little fins, like vapor chamber."
oyClS3qQV10,605770,606603,Very impressive.
oyClS3qQV10,606603,609610,But there isn't a whole lot of heat sinking.
oyClS3qQV10,609610,611610,Liquid metal job is kind of gross.
oyClS3qQV10,611610,613170,Well you can see that they have it taped off
oyClS3qQV10,613170,615920,all around the dye so that the liquid metal can't spill.
oyClS3qQV10,615920,617670,"But if they didn't have that, this would be dead."
oyClS3qQV10,617670,619450,Cause there's liquid metal just all over
oyClS3qQV10,619450,620750,the place around it.
oyClS3qQV10,620750,622530,There's the battery ODE.
oyClS3qQV10,622530,623580,What I'm curious to see
oyClS3qQV10,623580,626629,is if the keyboard and track pad are replaceable.
oyClS3qQV10,626629,630080,"There are two things where like, if you have a child,"
oyClS3qQV10,630080,632380,they can pretty easily ruin your day
oyClS3qQV10,632380,634920,by spilling a drink or something on there.
oyClS3qQV10,634920,637700,One thing I really wish Asus would steal from Alienware
oyClS3qQV10,637700,639340,is that Alienware has been putting
oyClS3qQV10,639340,642070,little markings just beside all of the screws
oyClS3qQV10,642070,643250,inside of their laptop.
oyClS3qQV10,643250,646140,So you can very easily find the screw that you need
oyClS3qQV10,646140,648370,and put it in and know for sure that it's the right one
oyClS3qQV10,648370,650420,and you're not going to accidentally like put a screw
oyClS3qQV10,650420,651933,through your keyboard or something.
oyClS3qQV10,651934,655670,Okay. There's the main board out.
oyClS3qQV10,655670,659540,Not looking good for repairabilty after that.
oyClS3qQV10,659540,660839,"So,"
oyClS3qQV10,660840,661933,track pad.
oyClS3qQV10,662870,663703,"Oh,"
oyClS3qQV10,665450,666423,Can we?
oyClS3qQV10,668690,670330,Haha.
oyClS3qQV10,670330,671930,Okay. The track pad comes out.
oyClS3qQV10,671930,674310,"I don't know how easy it'll be to get these,"
oyClS3qQV10,674310,677910,"but if you can, it is possible to replace it. Awesome."
oyClS3qQV10,677910,680750,So it looks like that the keyboard is able to be removed.
oyClS3qQV10,680750,683730,So you could theoretically just replace the whole thing.
oyClS3qQV10,683730,686430,This is actually quite a repairable little laptop.
oyClS3qQV10,686430,688290,"As long as there's parts available,"
oyClS3qQV10,688290,690589,you can replace most of the bits
oyClS3qQV10,690590,692340,and not have to throw the whole thing out
oyClS3qQV10,692340,694020,which is awesome to see.
oyClS3qQV10,694020,696580,"A couple more interesting things while we're in here,"
oyClS3qQV10,696580,699730,on this laptop they included dust filters
oyClS3qQV10,699730,701420,right beside the fans.
oyClS3qQV10,701420,702940,"Apparently, they work pretty well."
oyClS3qQV10,702940,705740,Asus has this hilarious picture of a laptop
oyClS3qQV10,705740,706950,just caked in dust.
oyClS3qQV10,706950,709350,They did two tests with and without the dust filters
oyClS3qQV10,709350,711310,and they do actually work.
oyClS3qQV10,711310,714670,The fans also have this really funky
oyClS3qQV10,714670,717730,sort of dual pitch wave design.
oyClS3qQV10,717730,719060,"Apparently, it helps a lot"
oyClS3qQV10,719060,721290,with the turbulence of the air coming out
oyClS3qQV10,721290,723630,and makes the heat sinks more effective.
oyClS3qQV10,723630,726210,"So the new G14 then,"
oyClS3qQV10,726210,727150,"on one hand,"
oyClS3qQV10,727150,730090,I'm kind of sad that Asus up the price by so much.
oyClS3qQV10,730090,732180,"Like, I know AMD aren't our friends"
oyClS3qQV10,732180,733450,and it was only a matter of time
oyClS3qQV10,733450,734870,until they started charging more
oyClS3qQV10,734870,737230,for really high quality mobile processors.
oyClS3qQV10,737230,738540,But it still does sting.
oyClS3qQV10,738540,740779,"On the other hand, if you have the cash,"
oyClS3qQV10,740780,742800,it's also just a great laptop.
oyClS3qQV10,742800,745870,"It's portable, awesome to use has a strong battery life"
oyClS3qQV10,745870,748850,and I just plain like it. Easy recommendation.
