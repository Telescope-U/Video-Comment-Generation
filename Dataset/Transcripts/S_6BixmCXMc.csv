S_6BixmCXMc,480080,485680,i spent all of my 40s  doing what i could have been doing in my  30s
S_6BixmCXMc,485680,491840,i looked up man i had let too much time  slip away if you could get young people  to get their foot on the gas pedal in
S_6BixmCXMc,491840,497919,their 20s  because right now they think going out  is everything  and i keep telling them man you're gonna
S_6BixmCXMc,497919,504000,get you gonna outgrow that in a minute  cause you know like at this age  it's when somebody says hey we're gonna

S_6BixmCXMc,509280,516880,are you kidding me  it don't make no sense to you now  because you're over that but it takes a  minute for them to understand them sad
S_6BixmCXMc,516880,522640,i wish they get it but  it was i wasn't clubbing in my 20s i  just
S_6BixmCXMc,522640,527680,i didn't i didn't know how to make a  vision board i didn't i didn't know how  to  [Music]
S_6BixmCXMc,527680,533680,what really changed my life man was i  started i got in amway when i was about
S_6BixmCXMc,533680,540240,24  i got in amway  and that changed my life man because the
S_6BixmCXMc,540240,547519,first time ever they introduced me to  self-help books  and i read two books
S_6BixmCXMc,547519,552720,that changed my life it was a power  positive thinker by norman vincent peale
S_6BixmCXMc,552720,558880,and the magic of thinking big by david  schwartz  i read them books and it changed my life
S_6BixmCXMc,558880,564480,but it also made me remember what my  mother had taught me because she was a  sunday school teacher because all  self-help books
S_6BixmCXMc,564480,569519,are bible-based this nothing everything  comes from the bible all of all them
S_6BixmCXMc,569519,575440,self-help books that's proverbs that's  all it is it's the book of wisdom and  understanding of you
S_6BixmCXMc,575440,581200,if you could read that it would change  your life too but sometimes you need  you know regular books where you can
S_6BixmCXMc,581200,586959,relate to it differently but it's all  comes from the bible it's like a great  book is the secret but if you read the
S_6BixmCXMc,586959,592000,secret it's all bible verse i mean it's  just based on the bible you can't think
S_6BixmCXMc,592000,600320,of nothing new how to tell a person  succeed without the bible you can't  it  doesn't work that way you know so
S_6BixmCXMc,600720,606959,a couple of books changed my life man  but the magic of thinking big was huge  for me it just taught me one simple
S_6BixmCXMc,606959,612720,principle  it don't cost no more energy to think  big than it does small
S_6BixmCXMc,612720,619360,you can say volkswagen and you can say  rolls royce with the same amount of  effort you ain't got the grunt to say
S_6BixmCXMc,619360,625839,rolls royce  so if the bible is true  would you say as a man is as he thinking
S_6BixmCXMc,625839,633279,if you think poor thoughts  [Music]  you got to be poor the moment you change
S_6BixmCXMc,633279,639600,that thought  into wealth of riches you start the  process to becoming wealthy or rich
S_6BixmCXMc,639600,646320,it's just it's not a magic trick  i mean it's really how it works i you  know people complicated you gotta do
S_6BixmCXMc,646320,652079,this and you gotta do that but bob was  pretty plain  ain't got no loopholes and really don't
S_6BixmCXMc,652079,657440,it's just real simple you say what it's  saying  all you gotta do is believe is talking
S_6BixmCXMc,657440,663760,to  [Music]  you that's what it is most people don't  think that god is talking to them that i
S_6BixmCXMc,663760,669120,come to give you life and give you life  more abundantly you don't think he  talking to you
S_6BixmCXMc,669120,675120,he'll give you life more abundantly he  do he really will  you ain't got to be rich to have an
S_6BixmCXMc,675120,682720,abundant life sometimes you just need to  be healthy happy  you know you could be really happy man  making 70 000 a year you really really
S_6BixmCXMc,682720,689760,can you don't need a few million  i did but you could you didn't need it
S_6BixmCXMc,689760,695279,it helped me a little bit  but to be honest it didn't make me happy
S_6BixmCXMc,695279,701040,and to you well i need god to be happy  so i ain't gonna  i ain't no preacher
S_6BixmCXMc,701040,707839,we got ministers in the room so  i'm just telling y'all from a hood  perspective what i did to get him
S_6BixmCXMc,707839,714639,you can go to church and hear it  take it from a dude to come out the  bottom  [Music]
S_6BixmCXMc,714639,721040,ain't gonna pass an awful trail  if you don't believe me you ain't got to  but
S_6BixmCXMc,721040,726880,i made it  don't ever give up
S_6BixmCXMc,726880,733600,i don't care how dark it seemed for you  don't ever give up don't ever stop  believing and i know sometimes that's
S_6BixmCXMc,733600,738800,difficult  because it seems like man it ain't going  right at all
S_6BixmCXMc,738800,745519,i was reading a book td jakes has out  it's called hope for every moment it's  like one of those you see those daily
S_6BixmCXMc,745519,751360,thought books it's inspirational  thoughts for every day of the year is  what it is my daughters actually gave it
S_6BixmCXMc,751360,757680,to me for my birthday because they've  seen me change as a person over the  years i'm not guessing this they've
S_6BixmCXMc,757680,765040,actually written it to me and so  they really do appreciate the change of  me just becoming a better person you
S_6BixmCXMc,765040,770399,know because when you become a better  person you become a better person not  only for yourself but a lot of people
S_6BixmCXMc,770399,776480,are affected by you being a better  person your children are affected your  wife is affected your co-workers are
S_6BixmCXMc,776480,783600,affected a lot of your friends are  affected your neighbors get affected  when you become a better person or start
S_6BixmCXMc,783600,790560,to make that change it affects a lot of  people  the biggest benefit of it all will  probably be you i know i've benefited
S_6BixmCXMc,790560,797120,the most  without so many auxiliary benefits of
S_6BixmCXMc,797120,802800,just  being a better person and and i i've  stopped saying trying to be a better
S_6BixmCXMc,802800,808639,person because i just got to go about  business of getting better now doesn't  mean
S_6BixmCXMc,808639,814399,that i'm mistake free that's not what  that is and it doesn't mean i don't  still need encouragement and i won't
S_6BixmCXMc,814399,820240,fall and make a lot more mistakes  because i will but  i find man in these books that they give
S_6BixmCXMc,820240,826000,me i find so many inspirational things  and this morning when i decided to say  to everybody don't ever give up because
S_6BixmCXMc,826000,831199,i know how difficult it can be because i  do understand man that we will all face
S_6BixmCXMc,831199,838240,moments and challenges in our life  that's going to require us to just hold  on i wanted to encourage everybody in
S_6BixmCXMc,838240,845040,this book i read it says uh well they  didn't say it but i'm i'm paraphrasing  it now if you ever felt like you can't
S_6BixmCXMc,845040,852160,find him nowhere i mean you ever been in  a hole so dark and the situation so bad  you just felt like man i just i just
S_6BixmCXMc,852160,858560,can't find it nowhere oh i can't find  him where i thought he would be i've  actually felt that before and i was
S_6BixmCXMc,858560,864240,thinking man okay steve maybe a lot of  people have been feeling that wing maybe  you ought to share your experience with
S_6BixmCXMc,864240,870480,them and that's what i'm doing today you  know maybe you've told yourself that the  storm gonna be over some see this is the
S_6BixmCXMc,870480,878160,one that i used to do  i used to say man the storm gonna be  over soon and then the sun came out and

S_6BixmCXMc,883199,889040,left and then the rains just keep coming  i sometimes man you just go wow and it
S_6BixmCXMc,889040,894880,almost feels like god then missed his  appointment  okay see this is why i used to really
S_6BixmCXMc,894880,900639,get in trouble  i used to think man okay is he not  listening to me does he not hear me

S_6BixmCXMc,922000,928160,wrong do i have to keep getting beat  like this ain't i paid enough for my  wrong decision i used to just think like
S_6BixmCXMc,928160,934959,that i think he'd have moved on it by  now but what i want you all to remember  is that and this is what i read in this
S_6BixmCXMc,934959,940800,book  in the book it said that god doesn't  synchronize his clock by your little
S_6BixmCXMc,940800,947759,mortal watch  god don't synchronize his clock by your  little watch you got on your wrist
S_6BixmCXMc,947759,953040,god is in control of this whole thing  he does not move in a timely basis
S_6BixmCXMc,953040,958240,according to what you got to have  now he gonna fix it for you
S_6BixmCXMc,958240,964240,he gonna get it together for you but  it's in his time because he doing a  whole lot of shaping and moving and what
S_6BixmCXMc,964240,969920,i had to learn about when i was praying  for stuff was it ain't just me that's  affected remember at the top where i
S_6BixmCXMc,969920,976800,said when you become a better person it  affects everybody well guess what when  god answers a prayer it affects
S_6BixmCXMc,976800,983199,everybody see everybody gotta learn  lessons along the way and maybe he got  you going through a little bit more than
S_6BixmCXMc,983199,988959,what it looks like they going through  because he never puts more on you than  you can bear and so he puts you in a
S_6BixmCXMc,988959,994959,situation that you can handle so what  you got to do is since god don't  synchronize his clock by your little
S_6BixmCXMc,994959,1002240,mortal watch  he got a set time that he gonna bless  you the key for you is to hold on

S_6BixmCXMc,1268880,1275440,pay a little extra money fly first class  what it does is it conditions your mind  once you get in first class
S_6BixmCXMc,1275440,1282320,and you see how wide the seats are  and you find you find out why they shut  that curtain seat because they shut that

S_6BixmCXMc,1362799,1369440,just try  the beginning of being anything  is the dream the beginning of being
S_6BixmCXMc,1369440,1374880,anything it starts with a dream  one day somebody had the dream of being
S_6BixmCXMc,1374880,1381760,able to fly like a bird well today we  have airplanes somebody had a dream of  one day going into outer space people go
S_6BixmCXMc,1381760,1388640,to the moon and they come back people  one day had dreams of being able to  travel at high speeds all types of
S_6BixmCXMc,1388640,1395360,things it all starts with the dream  martin luther king had a dream that one  day all of us could unite and come
S_6BixmCXMc,1395360,1401039,together well it's happening it hasn't  fully happened but it's happening but it
S_6BixmCXMc,1401039,1406960,started with a dream those dreams are  available to each and every one of us so
S_6BixmCXMc,1406960,1413120,parents  if you have a child that says something  that's beyond the realm of your thinking
S_6BixmCXMc,1413120,1418640,don't make it not possible so when your  child says i'm gonna be a star and you
S_6BixmCXMc,1418640,1423760,don't really see the talent  they got something in them that you  might not know about
S_6BixmCXMc,1423760,1430080,they may have a dream and something  burning inside of them that you don't  know anything about it all starts with
S_6BixmCXMc,1430080,1435440,the dream  the bible says that a man without a  dream or a vision shall perish and
S_6BixmCXMc,1435440,1440960,that's so true if you don't have nothing  you're working for nothing you're  shooting for you really have no focal
S_6BixmCXMc,1440960,1446480,point in life and you wander around  aimlessly all the time  so all of you out there whatever your
S_6BixmCXMc,1446480,1452159,dream is and dream big my father used to  tell me all the time he said son aim for
S_6BixmCXMc,1452159,1457200,the moon because if you miss you'll  still be amongst the stars the bigger
S_6BixmCXMc,1457200,1462320,you dream the wider you let your mind  fly the more capable you become of
S_6BixmCXMc,1462320,1469200,accomplishing the thing see you've got  to understand that it doesn't matter  your financial circumstance it doesn't
S_6BixmCXMc,1469200,1474640,matter what environment you live in if  you can see yourself out of the project
S_6BixmCXMc,1474640,1482880,if you can see yourself outside the  ghetto wall if you can if you can see  yourself anywhere then guess what see it
S_6BixmCXMc,1482880,1489440,see it and believe it to be so  that is the beginning of all things  happening it is your dream and your
S_6BixmCXMc,1489440,1494880,vision and let me give you some advice  don't share all your dreams with  everybody because the moment you say
S_6BixmCXMc,1494880,1500400,something to somebody and they don't see  it for you or themselves they start  telling you how it won't happen now you
S_6BixmCXMc,1500400,1507600,allow that enter in into your mindset  when all you was doing was wanting it to  be so and now guess what then comes the
S_6BixmCXMc,1507600,1512799,stumbling blocks the hurdles the pits in  the road and now you find yourself
S_6BixmCXMc,1512799,1518000,trying to understand what they were  saying when all you really had to do was  go on with your dream
S_6BixmCXMc,1518000,1523039,so when i have dreams or ambitions i  only tell one person i usually tell my
S_6BixmCXMc,1523039,1529360,wife and after that i don't really share  it with a whole lot of people because i  know that everybody ain't pulling for me
S_6BixmCXMc,1529360,1535760,but i know she is so i share with her  what i'm thinking about becoming and  doing and hoping for us and our family
S_6BixmCXMc,1535760,1542640,and that's who i tell it to i don't tell  it to my friends my boys i don't tell it  to my manager i don't tell it to nobody
S_6BixmCXMc,1542640,1548000,because guess what they got their own  agendas too now they don't see it for  you because then that's going to get in
S_6BixmCXMc,1548000,1553360,the way of some plan they had for us and  them and now next thing you know they  working against that because they got
S_6BixmCXMc,1553360,1560640,another plan so i don't really share  with people i share with my folk and i  share with my god and that's it but do
S_6BixmCXMc,1560640,1567600,dream if you can't think of what to  dream stop at a magazine stand or a  bookstore and flip through magazines and
S_6BixmCXMc,1567600,1574880,see stuff that you like to have see  places that you'd like to go  imagine things that you'd like to be sit
S_6BixmCXMc,1574880,1581520,down and close your eyes and imagine  where you would like to be because that  is the beginning it is the dream there's
S_6BixmCXMc,1581520,1588640,a whole series of things you got to do  to become successful but just today i'm  just going to stay on this one thing
S_6BixmCXMc,1588640,1594480,do not be afraid to dream  do not be afraid to think that you can
S_6BixmCXMc,1594480,1599840,and remember this you ain't too old to  have a dream anybody can dream i don't
S_6BixmCXMc,1599840,1606559,care if you're 45 55 65 you can dream  about something it can still happen for
S_6BixmCXMc,1606559,1612720,you and the younger you start dreaming  the better you get it dreaming and when  you get good at dreaming then after a
S_6BixmCXMc,1612720,1617840,while you're gonna have to start making  some of this stuff come true and next  thing you know you're on your way but it
S_6BixmCXMc,1617840,1625120,starts with a dream so dream big open up  magazines cut them cartoons and them  sitcoms often quit watching soap operas
S_6BixmCXMc,1625120,1632080,all day and do something that'll  stimulate your mind the travel channel  the discovery channel watch a cooking
S_6BixmCXMc,1632080,1639039,show just get into some other things man  you never know what's inside you and  something may spark a flame that burns
S_6BixmCXMc,1639039,1646240,in you that you really didn't even know  you had but you got to open up your mind  and let it fly dream on with your bad
S_6BixmCXMc,1646240,1651279,self and don't let nobody tell you that  you can't and the best way to not have a
S_6BixmCXMc,1651279,1657520,person tell you you can't is to not tell  them what you want in the first place  it's your dream it really ain't got
S_6BixmCXMc,1657520,1660799,nothing to do with nobody else

S_6BixmCXMc,1703039,1708320,it's hard being successful that's the  first thing you need to understand

S_6BixmCXMc,1714080,1719679,i was homeless  i was homeless based off of the decision  i made
S_6BixmCXMc,1719679,1726240,october 8 1985  i walked in the comedy club for the very  first time
S_6BixmCXMc,1726240,1732159,never been in a comedy club but i had  been writing jokes  for a dude taking my jokes going to a
S_6BixmCXMc,1732159,1739440,comedy club he was paying me ten dollars  for it i had never been to a comedy club  had never heard of a comedy club
S_6BixmCXMc,1739440,1744799,i was writing for a buddy of mine named  aj jamal  he would pay me 10 bucks a joke
S_6BixmCXMc,1744799,1751360,one day i was writing some jokes for him  and i was over his house to drop him off  and this girl named gladys jacobs came
S_6BixmCXMc,1751360,1758080,over to the house  and she said you the dude just writing  the jokes for aj jamal i said yeah
S_6BixmCXMc,1758080,1765120,she said he the funniest dude at the  comedy club  i said after what

S_6BixmCXMc,1807279,1815120,do you know that god already designed  you for a purpose in life and if you  would just simply ask god what it was he
S_6BixmCXMc,1815120,1822320,could guide you to it and the search for  what i'm supposed to do will be over but  oh no we so busy figuring it out i got
