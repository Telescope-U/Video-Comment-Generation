HSst53uX6qQ,250480,253280,waved around as the ball goes is thrown
HSst53uX6qQ,253280,254879,to second base
HSst53uX6qQ,254879,257440,joey cora was stopping nemo at third but
HSst53uX6qQ,257440,259600,as soon as he saw mccormick throw that
HSst53uX6qQ,259600,261199,ball to second
HSst53uX6qQ,261199,263759,he waved nemo home and the mets get a

HSst53uX6qQ,272240,273199,third
HSst53uX6qQ,273199,275680,so just like marty before him lindor

HSst53uX6qQ,296960,298720,flies one out to right field that should
HSst53uX6qQ,298720,301520,get a run in marte tagging
HSst53uX6qQ,301520,303440,tucker catching
HSst53uX6qQ,303440,306080,the throw will be cut off and it's a sac
HSst53uX6qQ,306080,308080,fly for alonso
HSst53uX6qQ,308080,309919,and the mets creep a little closer it's
HSst53uX6qQ,309919,311919,now five to three
HSst53uX6qQ,311919,313520,that's line the other way that's a base
HSst53uX6qQ,313520,315280,hit over the bag and down the line off
HSst53uX6qQ,315280,317120,the jutting stands lindor to third
HSst53uX6qQ,317120,319039,chased down by alvarez they'll stop
HSst53uX6qQ,319039,321520,lindor at third base and guillermo in
HSst53uX6qQ,321520,325360,its second with a double
HSst53uX6qQ,325360,327680,and canada takes high ball four

HSst53uX6qQ,329680,331680,and lost him to a walk and now the bases
HSst53uX6qQ,331680,334880,are loaded for escobar
HSst53uX6qQ,335039,337520,papa on the infield

HSst53uX6qQ,387759,389440,the hand looking like it's going to be a
HSst53uX6qQ,389440,391120,strike but then by the time you start
