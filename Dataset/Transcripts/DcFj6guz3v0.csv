DcFj6guz3v0,1360,3199,here and welcome to a brand new home
DcFj6guz3v0,3199,5200,tech tour for 2021.
DcFj6guz3v0,5200,6879,so this is one of your favorite videos
DcFj6guz3v0,6879,8400,from last year where i showed you all
DcFj6guz3v0,8400,9760,the tech products that i'm currently
DcFj6guz3v0,9760,10480,using
DcFj6guz3v0,10480,11599,around the house and you've been
DcFj6guz3v0,11599,13120,following the channel for a while you've
DcFj6guz3v0,13120,14799,seen the changes that i've made
DcFj6guz3v0,14799,16400,both in the renovation of the kitchen
DcFj6guz3v0,16400,18320,and the floors changing up the bedrooms
DcFj6guz3v0,18320,19279,and decorating that
DcFj6guz3v0,19279,22400,as well as the office updates for 2020
DcFj6guz3v0,22400,24080,but overall there are quite a few
DcFj6guz3v0,24080,25840,exciting pieces that i've added over the
DcFj6guz3v0,25840,27119,past year so today
DcFj6guz3v0,27119,28720,we're gonna cover all of that just to
DcFj6guz3v0,28720,30160,summarize i've redone the entire
DcFj6guz3v0,30160,32558,office into an ultimate large l-shaped
DcFj6guz3v0,32558,34880,desk as well as a projector setup and it
DcFj6guz3v0,34880,36800,looks completely different than it did
DcFj6guz3v0,36800,39440,last year i've also added a new speaker
DcFj6guz3v0,39440,40719,in the living room
DcFj6guz3v0,40719,42640,also the ps5 of course that came out in
DcFj6guz3v0,42640,44399,the past year the other thing is i've
DcFj6guz3v0,44399,46559,also actually moved my operations
DcFj6guz3v0,46559,48800,of video editing and filming over to a
DcFj6guz3v0,48800,50399,dedicated office space i'm sure you guys
DcFj6guz3v0,50399,51840,have seen that series if you follow the
DcFj6guz3v0,51840,52399,channel
DcFj6guz3v0,52399,55199,that is completely done so it is finally
DcFj6guz3v0,55199,56000,my home
DcFj6guz3v0,56000,58320,whereas before it was just like full of
DcFj6guz3v0,58320,60160,all the tech stuff that reviewed and the
DcFj6guz3v0,60160,61680,products would pile up in the living
DcFj6guz3v0,61680,62719,room the hallway
DcFj6guz3v0,62719,64878,the bedroom and just all over the place
DcFj6guz3v0,64878,66720,so now i at least have a bit of
DcFj6guz3v0,66720,68640,work-life separation but i do still
DcFj6guz3v0,68640,69040,spend
DcFj6guz3v0,69040,71520,a ton of time in the office for video
DcFj6guz3v0,71520,73840,editing in the evening and on weekends
DcFj6guz3v0,73840,75200,if you guys like to win one item from

DcFj6guz3v0,91520,92560,below as well
DcFj6guz3v0,92560,93920,so beginning on this side of the living
DcFj6guz3v0,93920,95119,room there's actually a few different
DcFj6guz3v0,95119,97439,pieces and this right here is the sonos
DcFj6guz3v0,97439,97920,arc
DcFj6guz3v0,97920,99200,this is their brand new speaker that
DcFj6guz3v0,99200,101040,came out last year and it's like a new
DcFj6guz3v0,101040,102560,version of their play bar that's been
DcFj6guz3v0,102560,103759,around for many years
DcFj6guz3v0,103759,105360,it's still really good i use it in my
DcFj6guz3v0,105360,107360,home office actually but what i picked
DcFj6guz3v0,107360,109200,up for the bedroom and also the living
DcFj6guz3v0,109200,109600,room
DcFj6guz3v0,109600,111360,is the brand new speaker and it actually
DcFj6guz3v0,111360,113600,has 11 classy amplifiers
DcFj6guz3v0,113600,115119,so just on the number side of things
DcFj6guz3v0,115119,117520,it's great but it also has dolby atmos
DcFj6guz3v0,117520,119200,support 3d sound and just
DcFj6guz3v0,119200,121040,all the latest technologies as well as
DcFj6guz3v0,121040,122320,smart home capability
DcFj6guz3v0,122320,123439,i know some people mentioned that i
DcFj6guz3v0,123439,124880,shouldn't have it behind me but in this
DcFj6guz3v0,124880,125920,case the living room
DcFj6guz3v0,125920,128239,is kind of in a layout where i feel like
DcFj6guz3v0,128239,130080,putting it behind can make sense i just
DcFj6guz3v0,130080,132000,wanted to make use of the room back here
DcFj6guz3v0,132000,133200,the way it connects to your tv is
DcFj6guz3v0,133200,134959,actually through arc so it is called the
DcFj6guz3v0,134959,136400,audio return channel
DcFj6guz3v0,136400,138560,some of the newer tvs have a specific
DcFj6guz3v0,138560,140239,audio return channel but if it doesn't
DcFj6guz3v0,140239,142000,then you can also use
DcFj6guz3v0,142000,144800,the optical adapter that they include so
DcFj6guz3v0,144800,146319,yeah you have a lot of options and in
DcFj6guz3v0,146319,148239,terms of sound quality alone
DcFj6guz3v0,148239,150319,this sounds impressive so over to the
DcFj6guz3v0,150319,152000,media side of the living room this tv
DcFj6guz3v0,152000,154080,right here is the samsung qled
DcFj6guz3v0,154080,155920,and the reason why i've gone with oled
DcFj6guz3v0,155920,158160,in the office and qled in the home
DcFj6guz3v0,158160,160640,is simply because it is a really bright
DcFj6guz3v0,160640,162000,space and the sun
DcFj6guz3v0,162000,164080,is actually on that side for most of the
DcFj6guz3v0,164080,166560,day so i needed a tv that was as bright
DcFj6guz3v0,166560,167519,as possible
DcFj6guz3v0,167519,169599,but the oled honestly does look really
DcFj6guz3v0,169599,170879,really good as well so i think it does
DcFj6guz3v0,170879,172160,come down to the purpose and
DcFj6guz3v0,172160,174080,what i really like about samsung's tvs
DcFj6guz3v0,174080,175280,is that they have that one connect
DcFj6guz3v0,175280,177360,system so with one fiber optic cable it
DcFj6guz3v0,177360,178640,is actually able to go straight through
DcFj6guz3v0,178640,179280,the wall
DcFj6guz3v0,179280,181120,and if you don't want to cut any holes
DcFj6guz3v0,181120,182959,it is pretty invisible
DcFj6guz3v0,182959,184400,but in my case the holes were already
DcFj6guz3v0,184400,185840,pre-cut so everything still goes through
DcFj6guz3v0,185840,187599,there and all of the i o
DcFj6guz3v0,187599,189599,is plugged into this grove concepts
DcFj6guz3v0,189599,191120,dresser right here
DcFj6guz3v0,191120,192480,so now we're over in the media cabinet
DcFj6guz3v0,192480,193599,of the living room and this is where a
DcFj6guz3v0,193599,195840,lot of the tech lives both like inside
DcFj6guz3v0,195840,198720,and over here you have the sonos 3 which
DcFj6guz3v0,198720,200400,is a good home speaker and i'm able to
DcFj6guz3v0,200400,201680,play music on both
DcFj6guz3v0,201680,203680,this and the sound bar at the same time
DcFj6guz3v0,203680,205440,this is also team played and i also have
DcFj6guz3v0,205440,207440,the ps5 controller charging station
DcFj6guz3v0,207440,209360,and of course the orbi wi-fi 6 mesh
DcFj6guz3v0,209360,211200,system and the satellite part of the
DcFj6guz3v0,211200,213120,mesh setup the main setup is over in the
DcFj6guz3v0,213120,213599,office
DcFj6guz3v0,213599,216239,and it has a direct line ethernet to the
DcFj6guz3v0,216239,216879,computer
DcFj6guz3v0,216879,218239,which is why the mesh system is over
DcFj6guz3v0,218239,219519,here because usually when i'm in the
DcFj6guz3v0,219519,220319,living room
DcFj6guz3v0,220319,222400,i just i'm on my phone and stuff it's
DcFj6guz3v0,222400,223920,good to have good connectivity but the
DcFj6guz3v0,223920,225599,maximum speed priority
DcFj6guz3v0,225599,227200,should be over in the office where all
DcFj6guz3v0,227200,228799,the work's being done so i actually have
DcFj6guz3v0,228799,230319,a big hole cut in the back of this thing
DcFj6guz3v0,230319,232319,and there is the one connect system for
DcFj6guz3v0,232319,234400,the tv there's also the power bar
DcFj6guz3v0,234400,236640,and also the philips hue bridge and
DcFj6guz3v0,236640,237680,sonos bridge
DcFj6guz3v0,237680,239360,which is all in here and it essentially
DcFj6guz3v0,239360,241439,powers the entire home tech setup
DcFj6guz3v0,241439,243920,to allow me to fast and reliably connect
DcFj6guz3v0,243920,244720,and control
DcFj6guz3v0,244720,247280,everything from my phone in terms of
DcFj6guz3v0,247280,249280,gaming console i currently use a ps5 and
DcFj6guz3v0,249280,250879,because i was a ps4 user
DcFj6guz3v0,250879,252640,just based on personal preference it was
DcFj6guz3v0,252640,254480,natural to go over to ps5
DcFj6guz3v0,254480,255760,so yeah this is pretty much the media
DcFj6guz3v0,255760,257600,cabinet part of the living room and for
DcFj6guz3v0,257600,258000,now
DcFj6guz3v0,258000,260239,everything is able to fit inside nicely
DcFj6guz3v0,260239,262240,but i may actually do like some custom
DcFj6guz3v0,262240,263759,mill work or shelving
DcFj6guz3v0,263759,265759,sometime next year i'm not really sure
DcFj6guz3v0,265759,267520,yet so the last item in the living room
DcFj6guz3v0,267520,268880,is one that kind of hides underneath the
DcFj6guz3v0,268880,270320,console table and it really
DcFj6guz3v0,270320,272800,isn't needed but i don't regret getting
DcFj6guz3v0,272800,274720,it it was on a black friday pricing and
DcFj6guz3v0,274720,275600,it is actually a
DcFj6guz3v0,275600,277919,scent diffuser so one of my favorite
DcFj6guz3v0,277919,279440,hotels that i've ever stayed at
DcFj6guz3v0,279440,281600,is the addition hotel in miami we stayed
DcFj6guz3v0,281600,282960,there during nascar about a year and a
DcFj6guz3v0,282960,283759,half ago
DcFj6guz3v0,283759,285199,and what i really noticed is that from
DcFj6guz3v0,285199,286800,the lobby to the rooms there was just
DcFj6guz3v0,286800,288720,like a very distinct smell to it
DcFj6guz3v0,288720,290160,and i noticed on their website they
DcFj6guz3v0,290160,292080,actually sold the diffuser
DcFj6guz3v0,292080,294240,with the scent of the hotel and it runs
DcFj6guz3v0,294240,296000,for about 300 hours so
DcFj6guz3v0,296000,297919,a few months give or take maybe even
DcFj6guz3v0,297919,299919,longer and you have all the customized
DcFj6guz3v0,299919,301199,settings on the back
DcFj6guz3v0,301199,303039,depending on just how intense you want
DcFj6guz3v0,303039,304880,the smell to be i have it set
DcFj6guz3v0,304880,306880,relatively subtle so it comes on a few
DcFj6guz3v0,306880,308479,hours a day everyone who's come by has
DcFj6guz3v0,308479,310080,kind of noticed that it smells really
DcFj6guz3v0,310080,311680,good so i do plan to get one for my
DcFj6guz3v0,311680,313680,retail store and also for my office
DcFj6guz3v0,313680,315039,sometime soon
DcFj6guz3v0,315039,316400,so perhaps one of the biggest updates
DcFj6guz3v0,316400,317840,that i've made to my entire home tech
DcFj6guz3v0,317840,319440,setup for 2021
DcFj6guz3v0,319440,321280,is in the wi-fi system and this right
DcFj6guz3v0,321280,323120,here is the orbi wi-fi six
DcFj6guz3v0,323120,326320,ax 6000 mesh system from netgear
DcFj6guz3v0,326320,327840,when it comes to wi-fi six some of the
DcFj6guz3v0,327840,329120,devices that are currently supported
DcFj6guz3v0,329120,330000,that i own
DcFj6guz3v0,330000,331919,is the iphone 12 pro max some of the
DcFj6guz3v0,331919,334240,newest android phones and also the m1
DcFj6guz3v0,334240,335440,macbook air
DcFj6guz3v0,335440,337120,and with wi-fi six you're not only able
DcFj6guz3v0,337120,339759,to have a larger throughput of up to 9.6
DcFj6guz3v0,339759,340960,gigabits per second
DcFj6guz3v0,340960,343280,compared to 3.5 and is also much more
DcFj6guz3v0,343280,345120,efficient in managing the traffic when
DcFj6guz3v0,345120,346560,you have many of them connected to the
DcFj6guz3v0,346560,348000,same wi-fi network
DcFj6guz3v0,348000,350160,this router though is extremely powerful
DcFj6guz3v0,350160,351520,and not only does it have a large
DcFj6guz3v0,351520,352080,satellite
DcFj6guz3v0,352080,354320,and is able to cover up to 5 000 square
DcFj6guz3v0,354320,355680,foot with the set
DcFj6guz3v0,355680,357280,but it is actually able to reach speeds
DcFj6guz3v0,357280,359280,of up to six gigabits per second
DcFj6guz3v0,359280,360880,where i live the fastest speed available
DcFj6guz3v0,360880,362560,is gigabit internet and i can tell you
DcFj6guz3v0,362560,363680,that even through wi-fi
DcFj6guz3v0,363680,365280,on my iphone 12 and mabel we'll get
DcFj6guz3v0,365280,367440,impressive speeds through the wireless
DcFj6guz3v0,367440,368240,connection
DcFj6guz3v0,368240,369600,so the way that i have my orbeez system
DcFj6guz3v0,369600,371600,set up right now is that i have the main
DcFj6guz3v0,371600,372080,router
DcFj6guz3v0,372080,374479,in my home office and i also have an
DcFj6guz3v0,374479,376319,ethernet cord that is connected directly
DcFj6guz3v0,376319,378639,to the computer for the maximum speed
DcFj6guz3v0,378639,380319,and in terms of the wi-fi connectivity
DcFj6guz3v0,380319,382240,for the most part i am using my phone
DcFj6guz3v0,382240,384560,in my office so that is why the main
DcFj6guz3v0,384560,386000,router is right here
DcFj6guz3v0,386000,387600,there's four ethernet ports on the back
DcFj6guz3v0,387600,389440,which is super handy and i have the
DcFj6guz3v0,389440,390560,satellite one placed
DcFj6guz3v0,390560,392319,on the other side of the house where the
DcFj6guz3v0,392319,394080,living room and all the windows are
DcFj6guz3v0,394080,396080,and from there it is able to repeat the
DcFj6guz3v0,396080,397919,signal and give me a strong connection
DcFj6guz3v0,397919,399759,and from the wi-fi speed test
DcFj6guz3v0,399759,401520,i'm still able to maintain a really
DcFj6guz3v0,401520,403600,impressive speed off the satellite
DcFj6guz3v0,403600,405840,it also has four ethernet ports so i
DcFj6guz3v0,405840,407600,have my home tech connected to that such
DcFj6guz3v0,407600,408960,as the philips hue
DcFj6guz3v0,408960,411840,the sonos bridge and also the ps5 just
DcFj6guz3v0,411840,413919,to give it a very reliable signal
DcFj6guz3v0,413919,415919,even from the satellite so overall this
DcFj6guz3v0,415919,417199,system has been perfect for
DcFj6guz3v0,417199,419840,my setup and in a larger house that is
DcFj6guz3v0,419840,421360,significantly larger than the condo that
DcFj6guz3v0,421360,422880,i live in it is still going to be able
DcFj6guz3v0,422880,424639,to perform very very well
DcFj6guz3v0,424639,426160,this was all super easy to set up and
DcFj6guz3v0,426160,427680,you can also go to the orbi app and
DcFj6guz3v0,427680,428400,customize
DcFj6guz3v0,428400,430080,anything that you would want and also
DcFj6guz3v0,430080,431599,check the status and health of your
DcFj6guz3v0,431599,433280,wi-fi network at any time
DcFj6guz3v0,433280,434080,so if you guys want to go ahead and
DcFj6guz3v0,434080,435360,check it out for yourself i've also got
DcFj6guz3v0,435360,436880,a discount for you guys i'm gonna leave
DcFj6guz3v0,436880,438800,a link to everything down below
DcFj6guz3v0,438800,440319,so in the dining table area one of the
DcFj6guz3v0,440319,441919,only changes that i've made in the past
DcFj6guz3v0,441919,442560,year or so
DcFj6guz3v0,442560,444880,is in the dining room light before i had
DcFj6guz3v0,444880,446000,one that was like a
DcFj6guz3v0,446000,448080,gold led wayfarer one and it looked
DcFj6guz3v0,448080,449120,pretty decent
DcFj6guz3v0,449120,450960,but it had like a weird color
DcFj6guz3v0,450960,452400,temperature that didn't really match the
DcFj6guz3v0,452400,453840,rest of the place so i ended up selling
DcFj6guz3v0,453840,454800,it on facebook
DcFj6guz3v0,454800,456400,saw this one on sale and i think it has
DcFj6guz3v0,456400,457919,a really cool look to it
DcFj6guz3v0,457919,459599,i'm sure it's not the kind of design
DcFj6guz3v0,459599,461360,that everyone would like but
DcFj6guz3v0,461360,463919,it's 4000 kelvin it has tons of bulbs
DcFj6guz3v0,463919,465599,and it also just kind of stays out of
DcFj6guz3v0,465599,467039,the way a little bit more as opposed to
DcFj6guz3v0,467039,468720,the long rods that i had before
DcFj6guz3v0,468720,469680,one of the biggest things that i'm
DcFj6guz3v0,469680,471440,really trying to work on after moving my
DcFj6guz3v0,471440,471840,work
DcFj6guz3v0,471840,474160,out of my house is to keep it clean and
DcFj6guz3v0,474160,475840,well maintained because before
DcFj6guz3v0,475840,477360,there'd just be so many videos to work
DcFj6guz3v0,477360,478720,on and i would say that i'd probably
DcFj6guz3v0,478720,480560,clean it after that wave of videos was
DcFj6guz3v0,480560,481120,done
DcFj6guz3v0,481120,483120,but year after year it was just always
DcFj6guz3v0,483120,484800,so messy but the tool that i have to
DcFj6guz3v0,484800,485759,keep this place clean
DcFj6guz3v0,485759,488160,is the dyson v11 outsized vacuum which
DcFj6guz3v0,488160,489919,is their newest flagship model at the
DcFj6guz3v0,489919,490479,moment
DcFj6guz3v0,490479,492960,the outsize model has a 150 bigger bit
DcFj6guz3v0,492960,494639,than the standard v11 model
DcFj6guz3v0,494639,495759,and just basically using the dyson
DcFj6guz3v0,495759,498319,lineup since the v8 and the v10 and now
DcFj6guz3v0,498319,499759,the v11 and v11
DcFj6guz3v0,499759,501759,outsize i can tell you that this is one
DcFj6guz3v0,501759,503280,of the best accessories that actually
DcFj6guz3v0,503280,505120,makes cleaning a little bit fun
DcFj6guz3v0,505120,507680,it also has a run time of about 120
DcFj6guz3v0,507680,508960,minutes which is quite a bit more than
DcFj6guz3v0,508960,509680,what you get
DcFj6guz3v0,509680,511120,on the standard model so you don't have
DcFj6guz3v0,511120,512719,to recharge it right away and the kit
DcFj6guz3v0,512719,514640,also comes with a spare battery which is
DcFj6guz3v0,514640,515518,super nice
DcFj6guz3v0,515518,517360,so yeah usually i try to at least vacuum
DcFj6guz3v0,517360,519360,the place a couple times a week and
DcFj6guz3v0,519360,521839,yeah just
DcFj6guz3v0,526880,528160,because we are talking about vacuums
DcFj6guz3v0,528160,529600,though this is definitely not a tech
DcFj6guz3v0,529600,531279,product by any means but because i
DcFj6guz3v0,531279,532640,watched tick tock all day
DcFj6guz3v0,532640,534240,i thought i'd share like one of the few
DcFj6guz3v0,534240,535760,things that i've learned from it
DcFj6guz3v0,535760,538080,and that is this tool right here so this
DcFj6guz3v0,538080,539760,rug that i have is from west elm
DcFj6guz3v0,539760,541519,and i have it here and also in the
DcFj6guz3v0,541519,542880,office because i'm boring and just
DcFj6guz3v0,542880,544399,bought the same rug twice
DcFj6guz3v0,544399,546320,the one thing though is that these rugs
DcFj6guz3v0,546320,547600,shed like crazy
DcFj6guz3v0,547600,549519,it makes a huge mess all over the place
DcFj6guz3v0,549519,551680,it pills it like leaves like these lint
DcFj6guz3v0,551680,553440,balls which is super annoying
DcFj6guz3v0,553440,555680,so this tool right here is one on amazon
DcFj6guz3v0,555680,557519,that is like under ten dollars
DcFj6guz3v0,557519,559600,it is just like a i don't know like a
DcFj6guz3v0,559600,560640,set of coils
DcFj6guz3v0,560640,562959,but i just like go ahead and scrape the
DcFj6guz3v0,562959,564000,rug and it will
DcFj6guz3v0,564000,566160,bring all of the lint into a nice little
DcFj6guz3v0,566160,567760,pile for you to vacuum up
DcFj6guz3v0,567760,569519,and for the next like week or two you'll
DcFj6guz3v0,569519,571200,notice that the rug just like
DcFj6guz3v0,571200,573519,causes much less mess so i think it's a
DcFj6guz3v0,573519,574560,really good maintenance tool and i
DcFj6guz3v0,574560,577839,thought i would just share that as well
DcFj6guz3v0,578510,589279,[Music]
DcFj6guz3v0,589279,590399,so now that we're in the kitchen i've
DcFj6guz3v0,590399,591839,got to be totally honest with you guys
DcFj6guz3v0,591839,593440,and it's the fact that i don't really
DcFj6guz3v0,593440,594000,cook
DcFj6guz3v0,594000,596640,at all um i actually tried for a little
DcFj6guz3v0,596640,597040,bit
DcFj6guz3v0,597040,598560,last year when everything was closed
DcFj6guz3v0,598560,600160,down and i didn't really have
DcFj6guz3v0,600160,602160,as much work to do but it's just
DcFj6guz3v0,602160,603600,something that i'm not good at and if i
DcFj6guz3v0,603600,604000,spend
DcFj6guz3v0,604000,606320,hours making a meal or like buying all
DcFj6guz3v0,606320,607200,these supplies
DcFj6guz3v0,607200,609040,i end up messing it up and it just makes
DcFj6guz3v0,609040,610720,the meal not that worth it so i've
DcFj6guz3v0,610720,611440,chosen
DcFj6guz3v0,611440,613920,to spend that time on work itself and
DcFj6guz3v0,613920,615200,instead
DcFj6guz3v0,615200,616480,getting the food figured out whether
DcFj6guz3v0,616480,618160,it's skip the dishes or just going to my
DcFj6guz3v0,618160,619440,parents house for dinner
DcFj6guz3v0,619440,621040,each night this right here is a
DcFj6guz3v0,621040,623120,dishwasher it is the samsung one
DcFj6guz3v0,623120,625360,from the chef collection and after it is
DcFj6guz3v0,625360,626480,done washing
DcFj6guz3v0,626480,628560,it actually opens by itself by about
DcFj6guz3v0,628560,630480,five inches so
DcFj6guz3v0,630480,632240,i throw the dishes in there i forget
DcFj6guz3v0,632240,634000,about it once it's done it will let all
DcFj6guz3v0,634000,635680,the steam out for it to dry a little bit
DcFj6guz3v0,635680,636959,better and i thought that was just like
DcFj6guz3v0,636959,638560,a cool feature to have
DcFj6guz3v0,638560,640320,in a dishwasher but i don't know like
DcFj6guz3v0,640320,641760,for any other guy out there who's living
DcFj6guz3v0,641760,642560,by themselves
DcFj6guz3v0,642560,644480,i just find like cooking for one person
DcFj6guz3v0,644480,646320,to be very difficult and when you break
DcFj6guz3v0,646320,647120,down the cost
DcFj6guz3v0,647120,649519,per meal after having to buy all the
DcFj6guz3v0,649519,651519,bits and pieces and tools that
DcFj6guz3v0,651519,654079,aren't in the kitchen already it ends up
DcFj6guz3v0,654079,655440,just costing more than doing something
DcFj6guz3v0,655440,657120,like a meal plan so some of my favorite
DcFj6guz3v0,657120,658480,accessories that i have in the kitchen
DcFj6guz3v0,658480,659839,are actually on the coffee side of
DcFj6guz3v0,659839,660320,things
DcFj6guz3v0,660320,662320,and i know there's a lot of options out
DcFj6guz3v0,662320,664079,there and sometimes you just want like a
DcFj6guz3v0,664079,666079,simple coffee maker that is probably
DcFj6guz3v0,666079,667120,lower in price
DcFj6guz3v0,667120,668800,but there are also some higher end
DcFj6guz3v0,668800,670480,accessories that can really make the
DcFj6guz3v0,670480,671120,experience
DcFj6guz3v0,671120,674399,fun each morning for your routine so
DcFj6guz3v0,674399,675839,these are products that i actually
DcFj6guz3v0,675839,677440,really enjoy and i've had this kettle
DcFj6guz3v0,677440,679120,for quite a while and this grinder just
DcFj6guz3v0,679120,679920,showed up
DcFj6guz3v0,679920,681680,but yeah this kettle is super easy to
DcFj6guz3v0,681680,683519,use it not only looks great
DcFj6guz3v0,683519,685600,it is the stag ekg and a lot of my
DcFj6guz3v0,685600,687200,friends had it which is when i saw it
DcFj6guz3v0,687200,688959,and decided to get one for myself
DcFj6guz3v0,688959,690800,and you actually just go ahead and plug
DcFj6guz3v0,690800,692640,it in there's a dial right here that
DcFj6guz3v0,692640,694000,allows you to set the temperature
DcFj6guz3v0,694000,695839,down to the specifics and there's also a
DcFj6guz3v0,695839,697120,hold button on the back
DcFj6guz3v0,697120,698640,that retains the temperature for a
DcFj6guz3v0,698640,700480,period of time so
DcFj6guz3v0,700480,702079,whenever you're doing pour over coffee
DcFj6guz3v0,702079,703519,this makes things very easy
DcFj6guz3v0,703519,705760,um and for a kettle it not only has like
DcFj6guz3v0,705760,707600,this nice classic look to it
DcFj6guz3v0,707600,709279,and the matte black that goes very well
DcFj6guz3v0,709279,711040,with this space in the office
DcFj6guz3v0,711040,713600,but it also has the tech side of things
DcFj6guz3v0,713600,714320,to go with that
DcFj6guz3v0,714320,715600,and the newest product in their lineup
DcFj6guz3v0,715600,717360,is the fellow old grinder and i actually
DcFj6guz3v0,717360,718720,saw their kickstarter video
DcFj6guz3v0,718720,721680,about a year ago and it was just had my
DcFj6guz3v0,721680,722639,eye on it and
DcFj6guz3v0,722639,724639,i just thought it was so cool it just
DcFj6guz3v0,724639,726320,looks very different it's super well
DcFj6guz3v0,726320,728399,built and fully out of metal
DcFj6guz3v0,728399,730480,but most importantly it is a really good
DcFj6guz3v0,730480,731440,coffee grinder
DcFj6guz3v0,731440,732880,because you have all the specific
DcFj6guz3v0,732880,735279,settings that have 64 settings in total
DcFj6guz3v0,735279,737200,and it lets you know like kind of the
DcFj6guz3v0,737200,739360,range of what you would like to set the
DcFj6guz3v0,739360,741200,grind size to
DcFj6guz3v0,741200,742959,so yeah you just put your coffee through
DcFj6guz3v0,742959,744720,the top you set your weight
DcFj6guz3v0,744720,747360,and you can set your grind settings
DcFj6guz3v0,747360,749279,press the button in the front and
DcFj6guz3v0,749279,751440,just empty out the extra pieces in there
DcFj6guz3v0,751440,754000,but overall it is just a very precise
DcFj6guz3v0,754000,756240,and high-end coffee grinder if you make
DcFj6guz3v0,756240,757839,coffee every day then this is definitely
DcFj6guz3v0,757839,759279,something that you should check out
DcFj6guz3v0,759279,760399,if you guys have any like bean
DcFj6guz3v0,760399,761760,suggestions make sure you let me know
DcFj6guz3v0,761760,763279,but i'm definitely someone who has to
DcFj6guz3v0,763279,765120,drink coffee every single day and i feel
DcFj6guz3v0,765120,766480,like checking out some of the tech
DcFj6guz3v0,766480,768160,accessories like this that not only look
DcFj6guz3v0,768160,770560,really really cool in the kitchen just
DcFj6guz3v0,770560,772079,makes it a lot more fun
DcFj6guz3v0,772079,774160,um this is not sponsored at all i just
DcFj6guz3v0,774160,776079,really like these products a lot
DcFj6guz3v0,776079,777120,so now that we're in the hallway we're
DcFj6guz3v0,777120,778720,going to take a look at the thermostat
DcFj6guz3v0,778720,779200,and this
DcFj6guz3v0,779200,781519,is the new one from nest and for the
DcFj6guz3v0,781519,782880,most part honestly i haven't really
DcFj6guz3v0,782880,784160,noticed that big of a difference in
DcFj6guz3v0,784160,785600,terms of functionality
DcFj6guz3v0,785600,787519,but it does look a little bit different
DcFj6guz3v0,787519,789279,it has a bit more of a futuristic
DcFj6guz3v0,789279,791040,holographic look on the screen with a
DcFj6guz3v0,791040,792480,reflective finish
DcFj6guz3v0,792480,794800,and it also uses the google home app and
DcFj6guz3v0,794800,797440,doesn't work with the nest app anymore
DcFj6guz3v0,797440,799440,because google owns nest which is kind
DcFj6guz3v0,799440,800880,of unfortunate because i have quite a
DcFj6guz3v0,800880,802800,few other nest accessories so
DcFj6guz3v0,802800,804240,because i don't use the google home app
DcFj6guz3v0,804240,806079,very often i sort of have to jump in
DcFj6guz3v0,806079,807120,between them but
DcFj6guz3v0,807120,808720,i guess it's no big deal but with a
DcFj6guz3v0,808720,809920,thermostat like this you can just
DcFj6guz3v0,809920,812240,schedule them it will try to optimize
DcFj6guz3v0,812240,814480,for cost savings in the power bill it
DcFj6guz3v0,814480,815920,also knows when you're home and away and
DcFj6guz3v0,815920,817680,can set schedules based on that
DcFj6guz3v0,817680,818959,it comes in four different colors but
DcFj6guz3v0,818959,820720,obviously because my walls are like the
DcFj6guz3v0,820720,821680,whitest white
DcFj6guz3v0,821680,823279,i went with the snow one and it just
DcFj6guz3v0,823279,825120,seems to blend in very nicely
DcFj6guz3v0,825120,826560,all the controls are actually on the
DcFj6guz3v0,826560,828720,side so it is no longer a touch screen
DcFj6guz3v0,828720,829920,or an active dial
DcFj6guz3v0,829920,831279,but to be totally honest with you if
DcFj6guz3v0,831279,833440,you're able to get the nest thermostat e
DcFj6guz3v0,833440,835440,at a good price i think that one is
DcFj6guz3v0,835440,836959,actually a better option
DcFj6guz3v0,836959,839440,just because i like the intuitive feel
DcFj6guz3v0,839440,841040,of being able to rotate the dial
DcFj6guz3v0,841040,842880,completely instead of having to use a
DcFj6guz3v0,842880,844560,little touch panel on the side and i
DcFj6guz3v0,844560,846000,also feel like it attracts
DcFj6guz3v0,846000,847920,less fingerprints than this reflective
DcFj6guz3v0,847920,849199,one but from a
DcFj6guz3v0,849199,851519,design perspective being that futuristic
DcFj6guz3v0,851519,854160,look i think the new redesign does make
DcFj6guz3v0,854160,855120,a lot of sense
DcFj6guz3v0,855120,857839,for the new nest so here we are in the
DcFj6guz3v0,857839,859120,home office which probably saw the
DcFj6guz3v0,859120,861199,biggest change in the past year
DcFj6guz3v0,861199,862639,so if you guys remember the renovation
DcFj6guz3v0,862639,864720,of the whole place was in 2019 and one
DcFj6guz3v0,864720,866079,of the areas that it didn't make any
DcFj6guz3v0,866079,866959,changes to
DcFj6guz3v0,866959,868639,was the home office i was still really
DcFj6guz3v0,868639,870480,trying to decide how i was going to do
DcFj6guz3v0,870480,870880,it
DcFj6guz3v0,870880,872160,and how we were going to optimize the
DcFj6guz3v0,872160,874320,setup for both filming and working
DcFj6guz3v0,874320,876160,and one of the first things that i
DcFj6guz3v0,876160,878000,decided to do after purchasing the new
DcFj6guz3v0,878000,879519,office space and knowing that we were
DcFj6guz3v0,879519,881519,going to move the operations over
DcFj6guz3v0,881519,883839,was to really optimize the home setup
DcFj6guz3v0,883839,885279,this is actually the master bedroom of
DcFj6guz3v0,885279,887519,the condo so i sleep in the guest room
DcFj6guz3v0,887519,889120,the first thing i want to do was to move
DcFj6guz3v0,889120,890720,the desk away from the wall
DcFj6guz3v0,890720,891760,i feel like if you're sitting at your
DcFj6guz3v0,891760,893600,desk for many hours a day staring at a
DcFj6guz3v0,893600,895279,big white wall that is like a couple
DcFj6guz3v0,895279,896079,feet away
DcFj6guz3v0,896079,898000,does start to feel a little bit strange
DcFj6guz3v0,898000,900079,so i decided to pull the desk back and
DcFj6guz3v0,900079,902000,after a lot of brainstorming i went with
DcFj6guz3v0,902000,902240,an
DcFj6guz3v0,902240,905360,l-shaped desk that is also sit-stand so
DcFj6guz3v0,905360,906639,this is actually a set of legs from
DcFj6guz3v0,906639,907920,uplift you just go ahead and press the
DcFj6guz3v0,907920,908480,button
DcFj6guz3v0,908480,910639,and it will go up and down it can hold a
DcFj6guz3v0,910639,911600,ton of weight
DcFj6guz3v0,911600,914480,and on top of it i have a desk that i
DcFj6guz3v0,914480,916320,had before from bow concept
DcFj6guz3v0,916320,918800,and we had used that as my main desk for
DcFj6guz3v0,918800,920800,quite a few years and i also added an
DcFj6guz3v0,920800,923680,ikea carl b countertop on the other side
DcFj6guz3v0,923680,926000,and just essentially built a custom desk
DcFj6guz3v0,926000,926800,out of it and
DcFj6guz3v0,926800,929120,just got the legs on their own in terms
DcFj6guz3v0,929120,929839,of what i have
DcFj6guz3v0,929839,932880,from a tech standpoint on my desk it is
DcFj6guz3v0,932880,934399,very much for video editing and
DcFj6guz3v0,934399,936320,production and for a lot of people it's
DcFj6guz3v0,936320,937839,going to be overkill but because i make
DcFj6guz3v0,937839,939600,my entire living on a computer
DcFj6guz3v0,939600,942480,and online it does make a lot of sense i
DcFj6guz3v0,942480,944000,also have the thunderbolt hub right here
DcFj6guz3v0,944000,945759,which has the sd card slot all the
DcFj6guz3v0,945759,946399,thunderbolt
DcFj6guz3v0,946399,948959,the usbs the usb type c and also the
DcFj6guz3v0,948959,950560,ethernet and all the stuff can just plug
DcFj6guz3v0,950560,952720,right into that i can easily access it i
DcFj6guz3v0,952720,953839,have my card readers
DcFj6guz3v0,953839,955920,over here as well and in terms of
DcFj6guz3v0,955920,957600,speakers this is another area that i
DcFj6guz3v0,957600,958320,have made an
DcFj6guz3v0,958320,960800,upgrade in the past year or so and that
DcFj6guz3v0,960800,961680,is the kef
DcFj6guz3v0,961680,964000,lsx which i've seen to be very very
DcFj6guz3v0,964000,964959,popular
DcFj6guz3v0,964959,966800,so these speakers are actually wi-fi
DcFj6guz3v0,966800,968720,based and a lot of times people use them
DcFj6guz3v0,968720,970000,with record players
DcFj6guz3v0,970000,972880,and like hifi audio systems but some
DcFj6guz3v0,972880,974079,also choose to use it with their
DcFj6guz3v0,974079,974959,computer
DcFj6guz3v0,974959,976880,and what i can say is the computer setup
DcFj6guz3v0,976880,978560,is a little bit more complicated because
DcFj6guz3v0,978560,980399,if you use a 3.5 millimeter headphone
DcFj6guz3v0,980399,982399,jack and just plug it into your computer
DcFj6guz3v0,982399,983839,they aren't actually going to sound that
DcFj6guz3v0,983839,985360,good and if you spent that kind of money
DcFj6guz3v0,985360,986720,on a pair of speakers
DcFj6guz3v0,986720,988480,you definitely want it to sound better
DcFj6guz3v0,988480,989839,so what i've actually added
DcFj6guz3v0,989839,993040,is a fio k3 and that is a digital audio
DcFj6guz3v0,993040,993920,converter that
DcFj6guz3v0,993920,996160,allows it to have more power and
DcFj6guz3v0,996160,998399,essentially unleashes the full potential
DcFj6guz3v0,998399,999519,of these speakers
DcFj6guz3v0,999519,1001920,and the fio k3 is like a pretty
DcFj6guz3v0,1001920,1003279,inexpensive preamp
DcFj6guz3v0,1003279,1004480,if you guys want to get something more
DcFj6guz3v0,1004480,1006000,fancy there's a ton of options out there
DcFj6guz3v0,1006000,1007600,and the whole audio world has just so
DcFj6guz3v0,1007600,1008639,many choices
DcFj6guz3v0,1008639,1011440,but i found that by using that setup
DcFj6guz3v0,1011440,1013040,these speakers sound much better
DcFj6guz3v0,1013040,1015120,but the best sound you're gonna get is
DcFj6guz3v0,1015120,1016880,if you use it in the wi-fi mode and you
DcFj6guz3v0,1016880,1018560,can control all the settings from the
DcFj6guz3v0,1018560,1018959,app
DcFj6guz3v0,1018959,1020639,and also switch the input and everything
DcFj6guz3v0,1020639,1022959,from the remote that it also includes so
DcFj6guz3v0,1022959,1024000,one of my favorite additions
DcFj6guz3v0,1024000,1026798,this year is the benq tk850 projector
DcFj6guz3v0,1026798,1028160,and when i was trying to redesign this
DcFj6guz3v0,1028160,1028640,office
DcFj6guz3v0,1028640,1030480,i ended up putting everything together
DcFj6guz3v0,1030480,1032160,and then was trying to figure out what
DcFj6guz3v0,1032160,1033520,we're really missing and
DcFj6guz3v0,1033520,1034959,with the amount of space that i have
DcFj6guz3v0,1034959,1037360,above the monitor and between the wall i
DcFj6guz3v0,1037360,1039438,decided that having either a tv or
DcFj6guz3v0,1039438,1040160,projector
DcFj6guz3v0,1040160,1042400,up there would be super cool because
DcFj6guz3v0,1042400,1043918,throughout the long editing sessions
DcFj6guz3v0,1043918,1045600,it would be nice to watch like hockey or
DcFj6guz3v0,1045600,1047600,something uh just to be able to have it
DcFj6guz3v0,1047600,1048558,on the background
DcFj6guz3v0,1048558,1050160,and i feel like in this type of setup
DcFj6guz3v0,1050160,1051679,the projector just seemed to make a lot
DcFj6guz3v0,1051679,1052640,of sense because
DcFj6guz3v0,1052640,1054640,when it's off the wall doesn't have this
DcFj6guz3v0,1054640,1056240,big piece hanging up
DcFj6guz3v0,1056240,1058640,near the ceiling so yeah this right here
DcFj6guz3v0,1058640,1060000,is a 4k projector
DcFj6guz3v0,1060000,1062240,it is super bright which is handy for a
DcFj6guz3v0,1062240,1063760,room like this where there are large
DcFj6guz3v0,1063760,1064559,windows
DcFj6guz3v0,1064559,1066400,and everything so i do have blackout
DcFj6guz3v0,1066400,1067919,shades that i added midway through the
DcFj6guz3v0,1067919,1068720,year but
DcFj6guz3v0,1068720,1070160,i honestly haven't really seen anybody
DcFj6guz3v0,1070160,1072160,do this same setup before but
DcFj6guz3v0,1072160,1073840,i would say if you guys are working late
DcFj6guz3v0,1073840,1075280,nights or if you're in a type of job
DcFj6guz3v0,1075280,1075679,that
DcFj6guz3v0,1075679,1077679,you're just like kind of always got
DcFj6guz3v0,1077679,1078799,something to do
DcFj6guz3v0,1078799,1080880,then adding a projector and just having
DcFj6guz3v0,1080880,1082080,it play in the background
DcFj6guz3v0,1082080,1084640,can make things a lot more fun and
DcFj6guz3v0,1084640,1085840,distract you from the fact
DcFj6guz3v0,1085840,1088080,that you're editing like multiple hours
DcFj6guz3v0,1088080,1090240,a week after working the day as well
DcFj6guz3v0,1090240,1091840,so on the other side of the desk setup
DcFj6guz3v0,1091840,1093679,in the office i have a few other pieces
DcFj6guz3v0,1093679,1095360,that are just sitting on top of a
DcFj6guz3v0,1095360,1096400,console table
DcFj6guz3v0,1096400,1098080,funny enough i bought this console table
DcFj6guz3v0,1098080,1099919,on wayfair ended up wrapping
DcFj6guz3v0,1099919,1102400,all of the shelves in 3m dinock because
DcFj6guz3v0,1102400,1103520,it had a gloss finish
DcFj6guz3v0,1103520,1105360,and turn it into matte black and then i
DcFj6guz3v0,1105360,1106640,took some of the remnants from my
DcFj6guz3v0,1106640,1108000,backsplash project over
DcFj6guz3v0,1108000,1110080,at the office and had them cut a piece
DcFj6guz3v0,1110080,1111919,that fits this table so
DcFj6guz3v0,1111919,1113440,essentially i bought it for the frame
DcFj6guz3v0,1113440,1115120,and every single other piece
DcFj6guz3v0,1115120,1117360,of this console table has been modified
DcFj6guz3v0,1117360,1119280,in some way shape or form
DcFj6guz3v0,1119280,1120640,when it comes to the tech side of things
DcFj6guz3v0,1120640,1123120,so there is a sono speaker this is the
DcFj6guz3v0,1123120,1124640,original play bar that i used to have in
DcFj6guz3v0,1124640,1126240,my living room and i have this connected
DcFj6guz3v0,1126240,1127600,over to the projector
DcFj6guz3v0,1127600,1129120,so i'm watching like hockey or formula
DcFj6guz3v0,1129120,1130480,one at five in the morning my neighbors
DcFj6guz3v0,1130480,1132480,get to hear the race car driving by
DcFj6guz3v0,1132480,1134320,uh this speaker overall just does a
DcFj6guz3v0,1134320,1135679,really good job and even though it is
DcFj6guz3v0,1135679,1136960,quite a few years old whether you're
DcFj6guz3v0,1136960,1139120,playing music or watching tv
DcFj6guz3v0,1139120,1140880,it is still an excellent option and i
DcFj6guz3v0,1140880,1142480,have also seen it on facebook quite a
DcFj6guz3v0,1142480,1142880,bit
DcFj6guz3v0,1142880,1144880,at significantly lower than its original
DcFj6guz3v0,1144880,1146080,price so if you don't want to make the
DcFj6guz3v0,1146080,1147280,jump over to
DcFj6guz3v0,1147280,1150160,the sonos arc and the beam might not be
DcFj6guz3v0,1150160,1151120,powerful enough
DcFj6guz3v0,1151120,1154400,then this is still a really solid choice
DcFj6guz3v0,1154400,1155760,so the other thing here is a light and
DcFj6guz3v0,1155760,1157200,this is a buster and punch one we've
DcFj6guz3v0,1157200,1158400,used a lot of their hardware their
DcFj6guz3v0,1158400,1160000,lighting and also even
DcFj6guz3v0,1160000,1162240,their whiskey cabinet and although this
DcFj6guz3v0,1162240,1163760,has nothing to do with tech
DcFj6guz3v0,1163760,1166240,what it does have to do attack is the
DcFj6guz3v0,1166240,1167280,light switch
DcFj6guz3v0,1167280,1169440,or a smart plug that i have connected to
DcFj6guz3v0,1169440,1171120,it so if you guys remember last year i
DcFj6guz3v0,1171120,1172799,did a video of a micro lock and in that
DcFj6guz3v0,1172799,1173679,video we showcased
DcFj6guz3v0,1173679,1176400,a set of four miro smart plugs and those
DcFj6guz3v0,1176400,1177600,come in at a price point of
DcFj6guz3v0,1177600,1180640,under 25 for a set of four and i can
DcFj6guz3v0,1180640,1182240,tell you i've never been
DcFj6guz3v0,1182240,1184640,happier with a piece of tech especially
DcFj6guz3v0,1184640,1185600,for smart home
DcFj6guz3v0,1185600,1188080,at that price point and how it works
DcFj6guz3v0,1188080,1189679,right here i have the application and
DcFj6guz3v0,1189679,1190799,all i have to do
DcFj6guz3v0,1190799,1192799,is just press the button it will turn
DcFj6guz3v0,1192799,1194080,the light on and off
DcFj6guz3v0,1194080,1195919,as you can see and it is a smart plug on
DcFj6guz3v0,1195919,1197520,the bottom if you want to manually turn
DcFj6guz3v0,1197520,1199280,it on and off you can also do that as
DcFj6guz3v0,1199280,1199760,well
DcFj6guz3v0,1199760,1201679,and you can also set different schedules
DcFj6guz3v0,1201679,1204080,and routines so for right here i have
DcFj6guz3v0,1204080,1206799,this turn on every day at 8 pm and i
DcFj6guz3v0,1206799,1207520,have it off
DcFj6guz3v0,1207520,1210240,at 12 30 a.m and over at the office we
DcFj6guz3v0,1210240,1212000,have the feature media light and we also
DcFj6guz3v0,1212000,1212480,have
DcFj6guz3v0,1212480,1215120,the whiskey cabinet and that is able to
DcFj6guz3v0,1215120,1217679,set to a schedule of 9 30 to 6 30 or
DcFj6guz3v0,1217679,1219039,wherever you want it to be
DcFj6guz3v0,1219039,1220640,and each day i don't have to manually
DcFj6guz3v0,1220640,1222720,turn on the light but i've tried a ton
DcFj6guz3v0,1222720,1224559,of home tech over the past couple years
DcFj6guz3v0,1224559,1226400,some of which work very well some of
DcFj6guz3v0,1226400,1228159,them are just really unreliable
DcFj6guz3v0,1228159,1231039,but for the price point in a set of four
DcFj6guz3v0,1231039,1232799,i really wasn't expecting that much but
DcFj6guz3v0,1232799,1233840,i can tell you
DcFj6guz3v0,1233840,1235760,this one has never had a single problem
DcFj6guz3v0,1235760,1237280,and especially when you have it on a
DcFj6guz3v0,1237280,1237919,widget
DcFj6guz3v0,1237919,1239679,in your home page it just makes things
DcFj6guz3v0,1239679,1241840,much easier and
DcFj6guz3v0,1241840,1244080,it's essentially instantaneous from my
DcFj6guz3v0,1244080,1245039,experience so
DcFj6guz3v0,1245039,1246960,definitely recommend this for a budget
DcFj6guz3v0,1246960,1248720,option so now we're in the bedroom and
DcFj6guz3v0,1248720,1250320,from the tech perspective nothing has
DcFj6guz3v0,1250320,1251760,really changed that much
DcFj6guz3v0,1251760,1254159,in this space the tv is one that i
DcFj6guz3v0,1254159,1256400,updated to a qlik model i believe it is
DcFj6guz3v0,1256400,1257679,a 2020 version
DcFj6guz3v0,1257679,1258880,and for the most part it still has the
DcFj6guz3v0,1258880,1260720,one connect system it has the
DcFj6guz3v0,1260720,1262960,whole like i o and all that separate
DcFj6guz3v0,1262960,1264240,from the tv itself
DcFj6guz3v0,1264240,1267120,as well as the power so all of that is
DcFj6guz3v0,1267120,1268000,down here
DcFj6guz3v0,1268000,1269919,um it's kind of hard to keep out of the
DcFj6guz3v0,1269919,1271520,way but i have the
DcFj6guz3v0,1271520,1273760,55 inch model it is the same size as the
DcFj6guz3v0,1273760,1275280,living room it has all the smart
DcFj6guz3v0,1275280,1277200,features and below that we have a sonos
DcFj6guz3v0,1277200,1279360,arc but it is in the white color
DcFj6guz3v0,1279360,1280720,so the reason why i want the white one
DcFj6guz3v0,1280720,1282400,here and a black one in the living room
DcFj6guz3v0,1282400,1283280,is because the black one
DcFj6guz3v0,1283280,1285600,is pretty much facing the sun and so it
DcFj6guz3v0,1285600,1286480,doesn't show
DcFj6guz3v0,1286480,1289120,any fading or anything um as much as the
DcFj6guz3v0,1289120,1290240,white one could
DcFj6guz3v0,1290240,1291919,over many years you guys have already
DcFj6guz3v0,1291919,1293039,seen this last year so i'm not gonna go
DcFj6guz3v0,1293039,1294400,into too much detail but
DcFj6guz3v0,1294400,1295919,it just looks super clean against the
DcFj6guz3v0,1295919,1298159,wall and just very seamless
DcFj6guz3v0,1298159,1299919,and i really only use this tv to watch
DcFj6guz3v0,1299919,1301520,formula one in the morning because
DcFj6guz3v0,1301520,1303440,it's so early and a lot of times you
DcFj6guz3v0,1303440,1304880,want to watch the start of the race and
DcFj6guz3v0,1304880,1306240,the end of the race and just like go
DcFj6guz3v0,1306240,1307200,back to bed
DcFj6guz3v0,1307200,1308799,in between so i have it playing on this
DcFj6guz3v0,1308799,1310400,tv otherwise
DcFj6guz3v0,1310400,1312159,the rest of this room is exactly the
DcFj6guz3v0,1312159,1313760,same i have a sonos one
DcFj6guz3v0,1313760,1316320,the original model on both sides with
DcFj6guz3v0,1316320,1318000,the alarm clock that is set to that i
DcFj6guz3v0,1318000,1319600,also have them synced up so i could play
DcFj6guz3v0,1319600,1321679,some music in a stereo pattern
DcFj6guz3v0,1321679,1323520,and some of the changes that i might
DcFj6guz3v0,1323520,1325520,make this year to the bedroom
DcFj6guz3v0,1325520,1328240,is i'll maybe add like some mill working
DcFj6guz3v0,1328240,1330240,or wainscoting to the wall because right
DcFj6guz3v0,1330240,1330799,now
DcFj6guz3v0,1330799,1333919,it is just a large white blank wall with
DcFj6guz3v0,1333919,1335520,nothing at all the whole room is white
DcFj6guz3v0,1335520,1337280,but to be honest i don't really care
DcFj6guz3v0,1337280,1338000,that much
DcFj6guz3v0,1338000,1340240,it's a bedroom i sleep here like seven
DcFj6guz3v0,1340240,1341919,or eight hours a day and the rest of the
DcFj6guz3v0,1341919,1342400,time
DcFj6guz3v0,1342400,1344320,i'm either at the office or in the
DcFj6guz3v0,1344320,1346640,master bedroom editing videos and just
DcFj6guz3v0,1346640,1348080,at the desk i also have a couple
DcFj6guz3v0,1348080,1350080,phillips hue bulbs inside of a west
DcFj6guz3v0,1350080,1352080,elm lamp and one of the things i started
DcFj6guz3v0,1352080,1353919,using lately because i started waking up
DcFj6guz3v0,1353919,1355120,a bit earlier
DcFj6guz3v0,1355120,1357520,is the wake up function on the philips
DcFj6guz3v0,1357520,1358400,hue so
DcFj6guz3v0,1358400,1360720,it's actually able to start uh turning
DcFj6guz3v0,1360720,1361679,on about
DcFj6guz3v0,1361679,1363760,10 20 or 30 minutes prior to when you
DcFj6guz3v0,1363760,1365679,want to wake up and it just gradually
DcFj6guz3v0,1365679,1367520,brightens the room because
DcFj6guz3v0,1367520,1370400,otherwise it is pitch black after adding
DcFj6guz3v0,1370400,1371679,some blackout shades
DcFj6guz3v0,1371679,1373840,last year as well so yeah i feel like
DcFj6guz3v0,1373840,1375200,that's like a good function they also
DcFj6guz3v0,1375200,1376720,make like sleep lights that we've also
DcFj6guz3v0,1376720,1377919,shown on the channel
DcFj6guz3v0,1377919,1378880,so if you're looking for something
DcFj6guz3v0,1378880,1380480,that's a little bit cheaper then that is
DcFj6guz3v0,1380480,1382320,a solution for like 20 bucks but if you
DcFj6guz3v0,1382320,1383520,happen to have philips hue in the
DcFj6guz3v0,1383520,1384640,bedroom anyways
DcFj6guz3v0,1384640,1386480,then that is a feature that i found out
DcFj6guz3v0,1386480,1388320,about recently so now of course we're in
DcFj6guz3v0,1388320,1389440,the bathroom and i'm going to talk about
DcFj6guz3v0,1389440,1390880,some of the essentials that i use
DcFj6guz3v0,1390880,1392799,on an everyday basis when it comes to
DcFj6guz3v0,1392799,1394480,the tech side of things and i try to
DcFj6guz3v0,1394480,1395280,keep my routine
DcFj6guz3v0,1395280,1397679,super simple i do my hair in like under
DcFj6guz3v0,1397679,1398320,a minute
DcFj6guz3v0,1398320,1399919,but because we are partnered with dyson
DcFj6guz3v0,1399919,1401600,we do have this fancy hairdryer the
DcFj6guz3v0,1401600,1402000,super
DcFj6guz3v0,1402000,1403679,sonic that has been around for many
DcFj6guz3v0,1403679,1405280,years i really like that they keep
DcFj6guz3v0,1405280,1407200,releasing limited edition colors because
DcFj6guz3v0,1407200,1407679,they look
DcFj6guz3v0,1407679,1409679,super cool there's like a gold and blue
DcFj6guz3v0,1409679,1411360,one a black one
DcFj6guz3v0,1411360,1412880,but this right here is a simple white
DcFj6guz3v0,1412880,1415039,one so some of you guys have been
DcFj6guz3v0,1415039,1416799,watching uh for quite a while and i've
DcFj6guz3v0,1416799,1418880,been asking how i've changed up my hair
DcFj6guz3v0,1418880,1419679,routine
DcFj6guz3v0,1419679,1421440,uh so the way i do it and the reason why
DcFj6guz3v0,1421440,1422720,my hair is not like as
DcFj6guz3v0,1422720,1424320,straight and weird looking from the side
DcFj6guz3v0,1424320,1426240,anymore is because i use
DcFj6guz3v0,1426240,1428159,uh curling cream just like throw some
DcFj6guz3v0,1428159,1429760,mom after i get out of the shower before
DcFj6guz3v0,1429760,1430880,i dry my hair
DcFj6guz3v0,1430880,1433200,and then i would go like this and keep
DcFj6guz3v0,1433200,1434400,it at the two setting
DcFj6guz3v0,1434400,1436720,and just get it so that the hair sticks
DcFj6guz3v0,1436720,1438480,up to the way i like it
DcFj6guz3v0,1438480,1441279,takes like maybe 15-20 seconds and then
DcFj6guz3v0,1441279,1442960,i will go ahead and throw a diffuser on
DcFj6guz3v0,1442960,1444080,which i didn't really know what a
DcFj6guz3v0,1444080,1446240,diffuser was until like this year
DcFj6guz3v0,1446240,1448559,i've never used one before and i ended
DcFj6guz3v0,1448559,1450240,up just shaping it and molding the hair
DcFj6guz3v0,1450240,1451679,so that it has like a nice curl
DcFj6guz3v0,1451679,1452559,backwards
DcFj6guz3v0,1452559,1454320,and stands up the way i like so for the
DcFj6guz3v0,1454320,1456240,most part that is all done
DcFj6guz3v0,1456240,1457679,and then i'll throw on this product that
DcFj6guz3v0,1457679,1459039,i've been using for quite a few years
DcFj6guz3v0,1459039,1460720,and that is blue lay right
DcFj6guz3v0,1460720,1463919,um just some matte cream just put a bit
DcFj6guz3v0,1463919,1465279,on around the hands and just run it
DcFj6guz3v0,1465279,1466559,through and it just holds everything in
DcFj6guz3v0,1466559,1468080,place but for the most part
DcFj6guz3v0,1468080,1470320,all the work is done by the hairdryer
DcFj6guz3v0,1470320,1472480,and more specifically the diffuser
DcFj6guz3v0,1472480,1473520,if you guys want to see like a more
DcFj6guz3v0,1473520,1474880,detailed morning routine make sure you
DcFj6guz3v0,1474880,1476159,let me know in the comments section
DcFj6guz3v0,1476159,1476880,below
DcFj6guz3v0,1476880,1478240,but some of the other pieces that i use
DcFj6guz3v0,1478240,1479760,is just like this babbling shaver my
DcFj6guz3v0,1479760,1481520,barber hadn't recommended it
DcFj6guz3v0,1481520,1484240,and it is a double foil shaver i
DcFj6guz3v0,1484240,1485200,replaced the
DcFj6guz3v0,1485200,1486720,the top and i couldn't find it in gold
DcFj6guz3v0,1486720,1488559,anymore but it's no big deal but
DcFj6guz3v0,1488559,1490480,yeah this is just pretty easy to use it
DcFj6guz3v0,1490480,1493360,is rechargeable and it's what i use to
DcFj6guz3v0,1493360,1495440,shave this off every day because i
DcFj6guz3v0,1495440,1496880,probably don't look very good with a
DcFj6guz3v0,1496880,1497760,beard
DcFj6guz3v0,1497760,1500320,um toothbrush it is one from bruce i've
DcFj6guz3v0,1500320,1501760,had this for many years now
DcFj6guz3v0,1501760,1503760,and super self-explanatory i mean it
DcFj6guz3v0,1503760,1505120,just has like all these different modes
DcFj6guz3v0,1505120,1505600,here
DcFj6guz3v0,1505600,1508080,recharge it you can get new heads for it
DcFj6guz3v0,1508080,1509520,on a subscription basis
DcFj6guz3v0,1509520,1511440,but these are like the three products
DcFj6guz3v0,1511440,1513279,that i use in the bathroom when it comes
DcFj6guz3v0,1513279,1515600,to tech and otherwise i don't really use
DcFj6guz3v0,1515600,1516000,or
DcFj6guz3v0,1516000,1518320,think i need anything else so thank you
DcFj6guz3v0,1518320,1519600,guys so much for watching this year's
DcFj6guz3v0,1519600,1521200,home tech tour where i show you guys
DcFj6guz3v0,1521200,1522640,some of the tech products that we've
DcFj6guz3v0,1522640,1523440,updated
DcFj6guz3v0,1523440,1525039,what i'm currently using in terms of
DcFj6guz3v0,1525039,1527039,gadgets in my own place
DcFj6guz3v0,1527039,1528400,i might do one for the office as well if
DcFj6guz3v0,1528400,1530480,you guys really enjoy it but overall
DcFj6guz3v0,1530480,1531840,this is like kind of been a progression
DcFj6guz3v0,1531840,1533200,over the past couple years
DcFj6guz3v0,1533200,1534559,i used to be someone who was really
DcFj6guz3v0,1534559,1536559,against home tech and i wasn't a huge
DcFj6guz3v0,1536559,1537600,fan of using it
DcFj6guz3v0,1537600,1539600,but with some fine tuning and trying out
DcFj6guz3v0,1539600,1540640,the right products
DcFj6guz3v0,1540640,1542159,we kind of figured it out and i think
DcFj6guz3v0,1542159,1543679,the system that we have at the moment
DcFj6guz3v0,1543679,1545200,when it comes to tech
DcFj6guz3v0,1545200,1547600,is one that i really enjoy the video
DcFj6guz3v0,1547600,1548960,editing and like the workflow side of
DcFj6guz3v0,1548960,1550720,things can always see some improvements
DcFj6guz3v0,1550720,1551120,but
