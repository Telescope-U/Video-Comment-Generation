qFOcxBGmOjQ,799,6799,all right so earlier today i was looking  at when i covered the original outriders  campaign and i saw it was last april and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,6799,13200,i like lost my mind i was like there's  no way that's correct it feels like  three years ago there's been so many
qFOcxBGmOjQ,13200,19119,games that have dropped since then  anyways square enix actually hooked me  with this early shout out to them uh did  not get a chance to cover it early
qFOcxBGmOjQ,19119,24480,though so you know kind of defeats the  purpose there but kind of jumping and  playing when i can i covered the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,24480,31599,original story on ps5  and i thought it did pretty well i  really enjoyed playing it's kind of like  a remnant from the ashes type feeling i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,31599,36960,like the third person gears award type  vibe as well  so i'm playing on pc this time and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,36960,42719,apparently you can boost forward and get  to the highest level and then jump into  the new story so that's what i'm kind of  do for this video
qFOcxBGmOjQ,42719,49200,and he likes or droppings greatly  appreciate if i'll do a part one kind of  see how it goes if we hit like 20 000  likes in this first video
qFOcxBGmOjQ,49200,54719,probably do the full thing i have two  copies of this game to give away also  one for ps5 one for the series x been a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,54719,59840,chance to win either like the video or  leave a comment when you found my  youtube channel
qFOcxBGmOjQ,59840,66400,all right had to kind of start brand new  so i went ahead and kind of made a  character i thought look kind of cool  kind of old guy you know uh i don't have
qFOcxBGmOjQ,66400,71840,one on pc as you can see so oh no it  took it all away shouldn't take us long  to get back to it though i remember
qFOcxBGmOjQ,71840,77119,exactly what i did  uh that was that one hair color there  boom
qFOcxBGmOjQ,77119,82240,keep the markings  should we go uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,82720,87840,um  we'll do this one it's fine actually no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,87840,93439,let's do that it's not as uh overall  i guess too much going on you know all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,93439,100079,right  levy  all right uh let's just do brad
qFOcxBGmOjQ,100079,105600,here we go  think we're good let's go ahead and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,105600,110640,proceed to lobby i think this is where  yeah here we go  start the beginning no thanks we've done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,110640,116000,all this we're joined okay yeah here we  go such a path and boost your character  straight to level 30. all out writers
qFOcxBGmOjQ,116000,121840,content remains available through the  timeline okay  nice  all right here's where i don't know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,121840,127280,what's meta now  but i think i'm gonna go trickster again  because i really liked being up close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,127280,132800,you can slow down the enemies stuff like  that  uh technomancer long range i think i had
qFOcxBGmOjQ,132800,138959,a class for each of these on ps5  medium range
qFOcxBGmOjQ,138959,145280,let's do this  i one thought this was like the coolest  one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,145280,151200,yeah as trickster each enemy killed in  close range hills you're in grand shoe  portion of shield yep let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,152000,158560,i like how you can just jump right in  what look at all the stuff we got
qFOcxBGmOjQ,158959,164720,uh thank you august is thanking me for  like  i guess i completed the campaign and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,164720,169840,didn't realize it  select story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,169840,176000,so this is kind of showing you what we  did before  and now i guess yeah world slayer just  oh it just starts right after it so it's
qFOcxBGmOjQ,176000,182480,like on the same exact timeline too  uh this should be the beginning right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,182480,188400,here we go a powder apocalypse tear  what is this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,188400,193840,there were tears but it wasn't called  apocalypse i don't think  i could be wrong we're gonna find out
qFOcxBGmOjQ,193840,198120,here we go man jump it right in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,204400,210640,outrider the last drop pod should be  just up ahead got it drop me here and  find a sight to make camp better move
qFOcxBGmOjQ,210640,215200,fast out ryder  big storm coming
qFOcxBGmOjQ,216560,218959,great
qFOcxBGmOjQ,222319,229440,tahiti i found the bottom going in  looks like you're not the only one  trying to get at it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,234640,239680,oh wow  all right  playing on ultra settings here we go i  need to get the data from that pod
qFOcxBGmOjQ,239680,246000,before the storm hits  okay earn packs points to complete  various story points in the world slayer
qFOcxBGmOjQ,246000,255280,canvas that's brand new the pax tree  so apparently end game has been buffed  for this which i'm not there yet
qFOcxBGmOjQ,255280,261759,apocalypse tears okay  oh i see ascension level 26 apocalypse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,261759,267680,tier 15 on that one  our extensions of the current world okay  because it was world tears before
qFOcxBGmOjQ,267680,273040,push the boundaries further than before  okay  unlike world tiers pocket series can be
qFOcxBGmOjQ,273040,278639,leveled with any type of content they  scale difficulty  wherever you choose to play so you can  kind of keep the game easy if you want
qFOcxBGmOjQ,278639,284160,to just like before  all right ascension xp here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,284160,290160,killing enemies pretty much  straightforward ascension level 115 now  the end game might actually bring me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,290160,295440,back to this a lot i don't know we'll  see  um one thing i do want to see though i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,295440,301039,want to kind of test out  the melee going on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,301039,309160,that was where we make like the bullets  oh man aiming is so much easier than
qFOcxBGmOjQ,311600,318560,i wonder if they changed some of this  this game plays so good on pc what in  the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,320880,326560,so this i think this is the thing where  i make like a yeah slow down time bubble
qFOcxBGmOjQ,326560,331600,man this is sick  um all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,331600,339240,i'm gonna take some getting used to  this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,340720,343360,ice pockets
qFOcxBGmOjQ,347199,353440,yo man jumping back in playing this game  is kind of refreshing to be honest
qFOcxBGmOjQ,353440,359520,i am frozen right now  that's not good  by the way if i play this whole thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,359520,365440,i'll most likely uh  play solo just like i did the original
qFOcxBGmOjQ,365440,367840,story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,371199,375199,you need to hurry the storm is almost on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,378560,381840,if he comes over here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,390400,396800,yo i don't know if i'm supposed to be  fighting this thing to be honest  is he gone
qFOcxBGmOjQ,400240,406800,man that is cool  all right one thing i want to check  hold on inventory
qFOcxBGmOjQ,406880,413520,because there was other skills what was  the slash one  that was the one i really liked okay we  got the twisted rounds which is fine i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,413520,419280,don't like this  let me swap it out  that looks cool what is this one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,419280,426080,borrowed time  oh that's right okay  hunt the prey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,428000,433759,that's the one i like  i like that a lot the blade  the slow traps also good what was this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,433759,440319,last one time rift  it's all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,440960,446400,i i like this we're gonna play close  anyways all right class  this is kind of showing us i'm guessing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,446400,451639,it just i could reset the tree if i  wanted to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,452240,457520,shotgun master let's see what kind of  path they chose for me  cool thing is i can always undo this if
qFOcxBGmOjQ,457520,464319,i want to which i don't think it really  matters right now  not really quite sure how difficult the  game is going to actually be so all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,464319,472520,right here we go  that was a lot of fun  here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,485520,488759,every day
qFOcxBGmOjQ,492800,499120,oh you said these paws were protected no  no i have to pull this data before  everything's fried
qFOcxBGmOjQ,499490,502589,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,505599,512959,he was right  i didn't believe it  but the anomaly
qFOcxBGmOjQ,512959,519399,it's growing  exponentially now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,520959,527040,everything we did to bring these pods  down  weapons
qFOcxBGmOjQ,527040,534560,seeds for crops  all of our knowledge from earth
qFOcxBGmOjQ,534560,541680,in the end  none of it matters  if we don't find a way to stop what's
qFOcxBGmOjQ,541680,548760,coming  there will be nowhere on this planet for  us to hide
qFOcxBGmOjQ,549120,553160,maybe it's time we stop hiding
qFOcxBGmOjQ,564950,574680,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,582720,588959,that can't be good  all right here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,588959,593440,i want to test out this ability really  oh yeah
qFOcxBGmOjQ,594080,599839,so samus is getting used to everything  as you can tell it's been a while thiago  bailey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,599839,605760,[ __ ] lady stay with the pod  something's wrong
qFOcxBGmOjQ,605760,613279,it's not used to changing weapons with  the uh scroll wheel i like the one one  two three but in this game you got the  abilities on there so flocks of demon
qFOcxBGmOjQ,613279,620000,birds dropping from the sky  if they can't adapt to survive these  storms i don't want to know our odds the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,620000,629360,creatures here the anomalies always  mutated them fast enough before but  this shift happening now is too severe
qFOcxBGmOjQ,630079,635680,oh we just got  i haven't looked at my gear oh my  goodness all right so this is kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,635680,642160,where  i get addicted to stuff right  although i do look goofy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,642240,647360,i really wish uh  it didn't look as bad as it did but  we're gonna go through a lot of weapons
qFOcxBGmOjQ,647360,654320,a lot of gear  that's awesome though and you look at  the stuff you start with too  kind of glad i skipped forward
qFOcxBGmOjQ,654320,659600,because they said hey do you want to  cover it i was like yeah i'll check it  out and you know i'm not playing the  whole thing again
qFOcxBGmOjQ,659600,665760,not on my watch can i get in here  i guess we're going back this way here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,665760,671360,we go  hey thanks for all the support on my
qFOcxBGmOjQ,671360,677920,channel lately by the way this year has  been pretty slow up to like i wouldn't  say it did it's like an elden ring  dialed to a lot of the stuff that came
qFOcxBGmOjQ,677920,684240,out early first part of the year was  nice then it hit like a lull so kind of  getting near the end of that hopefully
qFOcxBGmOjQ,684240,690480,this fall can't get here fast enough am  i  right  i've been on youtube for over 12 years
qFOcxBGmOjQ,690480,696160,now and i just get idle hands  i don't like this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,698240,702600,i wish i used ability to hold on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,712160,715879,okay let me launch
qFOcxBGmOjQ,718079,725839,can't use abilities all right  come on good brad wrong gun
qFOcxBGmOjQ,727440,734399,this might be kind of a challenge but i  like that  i keep it on the world tier one for the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,734399,740399,apocalypse tier one  for a little while  most here's like the games i play on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,740399,745600,mouse and keyboard now i play uh  a lot of destiny too
qFOcxBGmOjQ,747279,753600,i believe is another one i was playing i  need to finish that game  let me get close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,754639,761720,it's a habit of me switching the weapons  i hit two to change my other gun
qFOcxBGmOjQ,793120,799600,this game plays like a dream to be  honest  i'm just it's kind of cool today
qFOcxBGmOjQ,799600,804399,third person why this plays better than  most games i've seen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,807760,813920,i'll figure out how to use my sidearm  but  if i get kills close i think it gives me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,813920,820160,health back  that's what i was saying  that stuff on the ground is kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,820160,824720,i can't really like  do anything about it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,827279,832160,should be enough there we go  oh okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,832480,839399,actually worse okay  we're gonna just collect everything we  can
qFOcxBGmOjQ,843839,850680,sensitivity feels pretty good right now  follow me back up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,856480,863440,all right apocalypse tier uh nudes here  unlocked i'm gonna keep it on this one  for a second because i remember i  struggled in the main story whenever i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,863440,869360,went too far ahead without getting  better gear  so i'm gonna just hang out here one for  a bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,869360,874720,not about to go crazy  all right here we go  yeah i'm trying to figure out like how
qFOcxBGmOjQ,874720,879760,to use because i i can only scroll  through the first two i know this one  usually gotta hold down something
qFOcxBGmOjQ,879760,884880,i might just look at the options here in  a minute automatic slug shotgun yeah  let's go ahead and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,884880,888240,uh change that there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,892560,899120,so both of these are better but i like  the ar better than the lmg  but i i mean it does
qFOcxBGmOjQ,899120,905360,have a lot more ammo i'll say that  crit damage to close range let's just  keep this one what does this also say
qFOcxBGmOjQ,905360,911120,shots generate shield okay  put that i'm just going to put the  highest stuff on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,911120,916240,whatever's the highest  i'm not even going to look at stats  right now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,916240,922240,okay should be good  to hang out here at apocalypse tier 1
qFOcxBGmOjQ,922240,928480,for a little bit  so how do i hold on if i can't swap to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,928480,934240,that  let me look at hold on let me look at my  uh options sorry i just it's bothering
qFOcxBGmOjQ,934240,939240,me right now  cuz i saw it on there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,941040,948560,it's like looking on swap weapons q  oh i can just hit q and swap as well  which is definitely odd
qFOcxBGmOjQ,949440,954800,i'm guessing a hold down q let's try it  there it is
qFOcxBGmOjQ,954800,960880,because on scroller you can't hold it  down so i can tap on these but i have to  hold this down to get it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,960880,966120,oh yeah  case i'm getting used to everything
qFOcxBGmOjQ,968320,975720,his shotgun is nice  join me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,983920,988720,damn it  if you guys have gotten yourselves eaten
qFOcxBGmOjQ,992480,997680,you can equip it right off the ground i  don't know if that was always there or  not get back up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,997680,1003920,it's actually pretty tight  i'm just excited there's something new
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1003920,1009680,to play because i was sitting at my desk  the other day like yo what am i gonna do  for most of five it's gonna be rough out
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1009680,1011839,here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1016800,1022079,all right kind of getting the hang of  everything  i think when i played the original story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1022079,1026319,i had the music off i'm assuming it's  safe
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1028640,1034959,the way i view it is a lot of companies  want  like content creators to play their  games so now they're more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1034959,1040959,more friendly about it you know  ease it up a little bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1040959,1046079,all right sorry for the weird cut i had  to go ahead and change the keybinds  because it was really bugging me uh one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1046079,1051280,two three to change weapons  kind of what i prefer i'm also going to  keep q on there in case i get i don't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1051280,1056880,know which one's one or two sometimes uh  but at the same time  put all the abilities on the mouse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1056880,1062400,essentially mouse button four five and  then the top one  kind of feel like that'll be easier for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1062400,1067840,me there we go  we'll see how it goes i may change it  back  bailey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1067840,1072159,where the hell are you out rider in here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1077679,1081720,are we just gonna dodge this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1088160,1093000,get up  what the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1096000,1101919,the fact that he freezes your abilities  is kind of crazy  oh boy betty get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1101919,1104320,off me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1107679,1111039,oh you down with me there we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1116320,1123679,yeah if a little more uh safe with that  setup  because  it was definitely tough the other way
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1123679,1126720,just restock okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1133200,1138559,gotta admit playing this game after  playing a lot of other games i this game  definitely feels optimized i'll say that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1138559,1140799,much
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1146160,1151080,it's another vision they just keep  getting worse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1162960,1171120,ooh it's too late  you can't save  you'll try  i shall consume you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1174240,1179840,jenna i'm not going anywhere  but you uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1179919,1182720,i'm so sorry
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1185840,1191480,stay here  i'll clear our way back to the trunk
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1201960,1205190,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1208720,1214559,yo look at the background  a bunch of those big guys are on the  move if it's true they can sense a storm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1214559,1218039,before it erupts
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1222960,1228159,the sound design for this game is what  kind of stands out to me the most is i  think i'm going to play on ps5 i didn't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1228159,1234520,have a headset on but like now i do  anytime i play on pc after
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1241840,1247760,i love the slowdown  like different abilities you can get  with different ones i tried all the  different classes out and i still think
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1247760,1252960,this is my absolute favorite  okay buddy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1258720,1265280,the way to the trucks clear we'll be  there  i know someone that might have answers
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1265280,1271919,about these ice storms  oh we got something there what is this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1271919,1277679,uh is it better than what i have  looks like it is going to equip it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1277679,1284080,all right here we go  that's cool how the uh story just kind  of progresses right off the ending you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1284080,1288760,know  it just keeps on moving
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1297840,1303640,oh god what happened we were here just  days ago
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1305039,1313720,this must be what i saw  in my vision  this is only how it begins
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1320210,1323359,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1333520,1340080,what is this  open stash do i even have anything  considering yeah it wouldn't be anything  in here i would imagine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1340080,1346799,it's all my backpack  shira do you read me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1346799,1352320,shira alright  i can hear you what the hell happened  what does it look like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1352320,1358640,we thought it was just another storm  when we lost nearly everything on the  surface  anyone who couldn't move fast enough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1358640,1364159,where are you sheltered  i think last time
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1364159,1372039,yeah i don't think it makes sense to buy  anything look at this gun  rifle one shot okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1374559,1380799,she was talking then it just stopped uh  let me  let me go to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1380799,1386159,go look at everything right quick  i'm okay i might increase it here once
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1386159,1391840,let's go ahead and do that i'm just  curious  claim it and then
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1391840,1397280,i have that off so i guess  switch world tears
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1397280,1403240,the current oh you just tap it it's done  enemy health
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1403280,1408480,oh look okay what you get hold on gain  item level bonus two
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1408480,1413840,i'll go to two for now why not hasn't  been overly difficult yet
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1413840,1420799,i will put these on though if they're if  they're worth it  what we got here automatic
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1420799,1427760,double gun  i think i remember that i'm gonna keep  i could get rid of some of those as well
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1427760,1432880,i'm gonna each one  those don't have anything okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1432880,1440480,what do i do here i like the automatic  slug  but this one is a little
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1441360,1447279,i don't know  i think slug is the better of the two  even though it has less damage
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1447279,1452400,i could be wrong  i'll keep everything on now  i think we're fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1452400,1459120,i have ascension points so i haven't  used those okay this is all brand new i  know for a fact
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1459120,1464400,okay  anomaly endurance
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1466159,1474720,brutality  armor piercing i wonder what would be  like the best one to go through first

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1483279,1491440,elite damage mitigation now that right  there sounds very useful for in-game  magazine size critical damage
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1491440,1498400,critical chance i like the dice roll  because there's always a chance  uh next weapon leech bonus
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1498960,1504960,i feel like i may just go like  what's like the is there a damage

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1517919,1526679,armor  actually can i let me res actually no  i'll just keep that it's fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1539279,1542279,uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1549760,1555919,shira  what happened  it's over  i thought the signal the pods is a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1555919,1561200,haiti's whole plan but  the anomaly destroys everything
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1561200,1569679,i don't know how we survived this  there might still be a way you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1569679,1575200,you traitor you think we're going to  find out sure what the hell  he's been sharing information with the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1575200,1580320,insurgents lieutenant i have to fight no  no we don't understand no he can save us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1580320,1587320,save what everything we've heard is  missions

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1614720,1620240,okay  who the hell you've been talking to  salvador
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1620240,1626960,francisco salvador  he's with the insurgents but he's a  scientist we just shared data
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1626960,1633600,and you didn't think to tell me you were  talking to the other side listen to me  what he found
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1633600,1641600,it could be an answer but he disappeared  before i got the final readings without  those yes uh don't salvador
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1641600,1650399,if he's even still alive where do i find  him he worked deep behind enemy lines in  a place called black gulch black gulch
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1650399,1656000,you don't want to go looking for that  place operator why what's there an  altered
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1656000,1663520,all we know is they call him the  commander black gulge is his  you won't come out of their life
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1663520,1669120,yeah well  nobody's coming out of this alive if no  one tries
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1669120,1671520,come on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1678480,1684880,i think this next mission is going to be  crazy quest completed omens nice got a  new mission people zahidi knows a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1684880,1693520,scientist who may have answers about  these storms we're looking for a place  called  black gulch no that place i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1693520,1699039,i keep seeing it as shadows dripping  shredding souls
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1699039,1704720,this is an evil place outrider but i may  know a way to get you behind enemy lines  unseen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1704720,1710799,there's an abandoned fishing village  called drift water  i'll explain on the way all right so we
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1710799,1717360,got here looks like okay irons used for  weapon upgrades armors uses leather uh  epic legendary required titanium
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1717360,1723600,apocalypse gear requires  anomaly extract okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1723600,1728960,exchanging mods requires a mod to be  unlocked in a collection in iron or  leather crazy attributes require
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1728960,1734159,attribute shards okay there's a lot to  take in but i like it  go up with friends we're not doing all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1734159,1741278,that  i'm also playing this early i just saw  where it's not out yet
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1741760,1749200,let's go you can just change your hold  on what can you change can you just  change  yeah it's pretty cool you can do that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1749200,1754960,i forgot you could actually just pretty  much change your character all the way  if you needed to  uh restock i think we've already done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1754960,1761760,that we don't really need to do too much  what is this thing  okay drop pods let's see
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1762640,1767840,oh it's preparing expeditions okay  these apocalypse tears got me kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1767840,1770799,nervous but here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1775279,1779080,anything i can do for you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1780799,1786399,i'm actually gonna ask  i'm gonna ask all this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1786399,1793120,i'm sure it wasn't easy  growing up with jakob around  trying to be a dad
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1793120,1799039,believe me he was the least of it  being a kid in this  [ __ ] war
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1799039,1804960,i've heard stories  i can imagine  no you can't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1804960,1810159,you know you don't look much older than  me but i heard you got to magically jump
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1810159,1817279,over the past couple of decades  honestly you've got  no idea what it was like i'm growing up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1817279,1824080,in this non-stop bloodbath  you have any idea what it's like  watching your whole [ __ ] planet die
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1824080,1830559,no [ __ ]  i'm sorry  you must have lost people
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1830559,1837840,yeah  yeah  we all did
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1843679,1851840,always love how they get back in  position before asking the next question  here we go these visions  how do you know they're real
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1853600,1859600,how do you know yours are real  i don't see the future just
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1859600,1867760,shitty things that have already happened  except once actually  the first time it happened i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1868960,1876440,i saw you  well  there you go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1881440,1888399,all right when did you start having  visions where did these visions come  from  the anomaly that killed my mom
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1888399,1895200,i ripped through a hut in the middle of  the night decided to spare me i just  [ __ ] with my head
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1895600,1901840,i'm sorry  the bad violent awful [ __ ] that's all i  ever see
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1901840,1910158,i was a kid when it happened  i used to think i was going insane  well what'd you figure out you weren't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1910880,1916559,i'm still not so sure  how these visions
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1918840,1924799,work so you see the future  you can tell me when to dodge a bullet i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1924799,1929919,wish  uh that's not how it works i just get  flashes
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1929919,1935120,i  don't control it it just happens and  half the time i read it wrong but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1935120,1943518,corrigan was crazy about you  i get it right just often enough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1947440,1954080,looks like this is the last one  uh the truck makes it look like hell on  wheels nice
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1954080,1959919,so you can kind of customize everything  don't think i'll be doing too much of  that what is this thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1960559,1969279,that looks man us oh nice yo that's sick  is that the summon from final fantasy 7
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1969279,1974399,just thought about that  we got this one too i don't know where  these came from
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1974399,1978399,i'll never use an emotion worse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1979840,1986080,that is so cool  like a collections tab and all that  all right i think we're good to go and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1986080,1993120,depart and get going with the story  gonna need snow treads for the truck  soon
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1994320,1998158,all right let's see rift town is where  we're at now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1999919,2005840,he's doing really quick hold on main  story  oh so all the extra side quests if i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2005840,2011840,ever want to go back and do those i can  go back and do them now that's actually  pretty cool we dismissed that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2011840,2018760,now world slayer so yeah it's its own  thing started here now we're in rift  town now we're here so here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2019200,2024480,wonder how tough this is gonna be solo  it's gonna be sweaty i feel like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2029679,2037279,we're here  driftwater's up ahead okay thiago what  am i looking for a boat
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2037279,2043919,you'll need to find one at the harbor to  get across the water there  you should find a back way
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2043919,2050240,under the insurgent's walls  yo this mission looks already better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2050240,2055679,than the snow area  that snow area was not it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2057200,2062320,i think we're good  go ahead and just run around
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2063040,2068079,is this stuff coming from this collect  this should have been a good spot for us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2068079,2074638,thiago how do you know a way into this  fortress i was imprisoned there  tortured beyond
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2074638,2081200,i thought i was dead  but i managed to escape through the  sewers and stole a boat
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2081200,2086878,from here to the forest and  i never looked back the people who lived
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2086878,2092878,here in driftwater thiago  who were they an eca settlement before
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2092878,2098160,the war  there's nothing but ghosts here now what  happened to the villagers there's a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2098160,2104960,story  of a night fisherman  whose daughter would ring the harbour  bell each dawn to call him home
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2104960,2111359,but one night  insurgents came in the fog  and the fishermen slept right through
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2111359,2116480,the entire village slaughtered  when the fishermen returned and saw
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2116480,2121920,he tore into the soldiers  didn't last long  the next day
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2121920,2128560,a thick fog rolled in and a figure  stopped through it  with a long wrinkled and bloody hook
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2128560,2134640,the fisherman's ghost  driven mad by guilt taking his revenge
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2134640,2141200,the harbor bell tolled for each  insurgent dead  they say you can hear the bell still
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2141200,2147440,tolling  yo this is like my favorite mission  already just because of the uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2147440,2155760,the ambiance or whatever you want to  call it  it almost feels like that swap level  from remnant from the ashes a little bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2156160,2162480,boy collect this  hmm  the journal
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2168480,2174240,gotta look around a little bit but  i haven't seen a single enemy which is  definitely unique
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2174240,2180410,he's only counted that i guess  yeah look at the atmosphere
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2180410,2183869,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2192320,2196880,just kind of chilling right now  i don't know what's gonna happen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2198400,2204160,this will kind of explore as much as we  can  i'm thinking for this first video i'll  put this full mission and then after
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2204160,2209359,this one i'll probably stop and  that'll be like the part one if you  would like a part two just throw that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2209359,2215119,like button i'll see how this first  video does like the first day  and then start cranking them out if uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2215119,2221760,if need be you know what i mean  oh boy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2221760,2227680,oh boy here we go  a little capture point it'll be a nice  little fast travel moment if we really
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2227680,2234560,need to which i don't think we can go  anywhere from this point because we're  oh we go back to camp okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2234560,2236960,interesting
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2240160,2246960,why would there be an ammo thing there  yeah i mean like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2249920,2255640,i haven't really fought anything yet but  i did shoot some of those birds or  whatever
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2260160,2264078,i gotta go look for a boat sir here we  go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2269440,2274039,here it is  how convenient
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2284640,2288000,no boats on this pier
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2292640,2299079,ah  looks like there's one over there on  that dry dock
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2309119,2318680,what is that  survive the ambush oh boy we can hear  sharks it's insurgents it's the villages
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2327359,2330240,this is gonna be tough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2336880,2344869,i can't use the ability right now oh  there  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2350800,2358839,i just use this wall as best i can  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2364400,2369319,man the gun play is just so good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2372720,2380000,aiming on mouse and keyboard is by far  way easier on most games i feel like i  don't like the aim assist debate but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2380000,2386000,games like apex  shooting long range on controller is a  nightmare
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2392480,2396920,kind of stop them for a second you know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2407760,2411839,it's just too long of rage i think on  that one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2412880,2417000,look how picky this guy is
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2429280,2435000,those times we used to farm the division  and the enemies
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2442400,2448720,come on buddy  a little bit more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2450880,2457200,there  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2457200,2462800,the thing is this class doesn't benefit  from me sitting around you know i got to  get close to him
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2462800,2468559,which it's kind of a double edged sword  i'm thinking like do i just rush in  there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2472480,2480599,okay you know what  well we have a couple options here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2484319,2486800,going in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2492160,2496640,all right  now we're close range let's get it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2498000,2504160,i gotta do it  come help back at least that's good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2504160,2507400,hold on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2512560,2519640,i'm sure i'm shooting out i just started  shooting at everything  because the names are all over
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2546000,2551079,i'm so low on bullets i just realized  that um
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2565040,2570480,far away but it really doesn't matter  okay oh okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2570480,2576319,just need to get to that boat on the dry  dock  and get the hell out of here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2576319,2582480,i'm gonna go loot everything i saw the  dropped on the ground whatever i didn't  get you know what i mean  because there was a lot of stuff done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2582480,2591318,here  i was a little bit sweaty i'm not gonna  lie  i did not expect the uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2592000,2597760,i mean that was pretty wild to be honest  with you you had a lot going on and you  also it kind of brought me back to i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2597760,2604560,think one of the boss fights in the main  story dude i all kind of  came flooding back to my thoughts i  remember like you're having like storm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2604560,2610960,up this it's almost like a normandy type  thing  put that on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2611839,2618480,we'll take it  anything else better nope i know  statwise they're gonna have different  like skills and all that stuff like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2618480,2624480,uh uh yeah  the gun shield everything like that so  certain ones are better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2624480,2629599,i okay at this point i feel like the  damage on this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2629599,2636560,just needs to be changed so  double gun it's all close range
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2636560,2642560,that's good nice  and then this one put that on  i'll sell everything else once i get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2642560,2646200,back to the main area
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2648560,2655760,kind of want to test out this stuff  i think the slug is still stronger but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2655760,2661599,we'll give this a shot  oh no we're not we're not using a single  burst right now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2661599,2666720,when it said rifle i didn't know what it  was  they were gonna put that back on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2666720,2672000,and honestly  i'm putting that back on to you  i know the other ones have higher stats
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2672000,2679599,but certain archetypes are just better  than others  yeah this is way better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2689359,2694960,i think a lot of people clump this game  into uh a column with like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2696960,2703680,like avengers and  some stuff like that but i feel like  it's a little bit above that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2703680,2709520,you know like it's not  they didn't leave it for dead  essentially they're actually trying  something with it which i think this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2709520,2714560,will bring a lot of people back  i'm curious to see like the steam charts  and everything for it i know i'll be
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2714560,2722240,playing it for a little while  okay guys let's go baby
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2723359,2726160,oh easy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2730960,2738240,yeah the amount of bullets this thing  has versus the other one and on top of  that  the sheer damage is already good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2738240,2741960,some kind of writing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2751839,2754640,all right we're going in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2757839,2762160,the effects are very satisfying say the  least
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2767119,2772040,look at that gilly suit that's actually  kind of clean
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2775280,2781920,all right so gun play is definitely  satisfying  one of the things that brings people  back to destiny 2 i feel like is the no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2781920,2787839,matter what the gun plays always been  top-notch even if the game is in like a  rough area sometimes it's like the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2787839,2791680,overall game itself is just nice
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2801440,2807119,i know once we inspect this boat it's  gonna be off all craziness so let me  loot up everything i can
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2807119,2812240,restock  there's two restocks is there something  up there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2812240,2817839,oh there's the other chest right there  how do i get up there only steps really  quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2823839,2830720,i am highly impressed by how this game  has been uh performing so far too  like on the pc i have
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2830720,2835839,that looks insane  bolt action though in the middle of a  gunfight that might be pretty good for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2835839,2840960,like a long range  uh but  the thing is my class isn't really built
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2840960,2844200,like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2855119,2860079,oh damn it  this boat's a wreck
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2870079,2875760,is  that the fisherman  no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2875760,2880960,no there's no way  that can't be some fisherman's ghost
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2880960,2887480,i need to get a crib  letting thiago's stories get to my head
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2889920,2895280,all right investigate the new arrival  something strange  a fog moving in over the river
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2895280,2901039,there's a light in it  you need to leave this place i'm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2904800,2913480,here they come  oh you you got to be kidding
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2915119,2919838,all right it might be best to just  do this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2923359,2928799,help back  if we even need to  i thought
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2932319,2938960,hey let's go  i might just hold back here for a second
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2941280,2945280,except to try out that sniper to be  honest
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2946400,2952960,should i do it  let's see if this thing actually lands  here  the accuracy is insane what in the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2952960,2959040,the problem is i can't really go to my  inventory because doesn't fall off the  game  that's a cool mask whatever the hunt
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2959040,2966079,masters mask that's just so sick i'm  gonna run for it  or maybe i'm not
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2966160,2971838,doing gracious  what  uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2972800,2975359,hit me right there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2979359,2985480,i don't know what to do here  i'm literally like pen dead can i go  around
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2988800,2995640,maybe i can circle around them i don't  know i gotta get close all right my my  abilities
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2998960,3005839,there we go  there's something working  i got the vantage point baby let's go i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3005839,3009880,have the high ground now let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3013839,3016160,all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3020800,3028880,got ascension points let me go ahead and  pop these  uh let's do health and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3031760,3038000,resistance  now weapon leech is nice if you get oct  if you get a slug shoddy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3038000,3044960,the full auto one obviously uh with  healing and like the weapon leech it's  so good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3049520,3055680,armor piercing bonus  i'm torn because it's like i don't know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3055680,3061680,the power for that slash should be nice  but it's it's gonna slowly go up over  time
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3062640,3068400,i feel like just raw damage of  everything else or just having better  health
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3068400,3071279,armor piercing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3073440,3078960,i gotta i have to see something really  quick  armor piercing let's get that like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3078960,3083838,and flat damage boost are probably gonna  be the best few you can get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3087119,3092319,like i said it's gonna take me some  getting used to everything but i think  the progress i've made so far in this  first
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3092319,3097079,long video has been pretty good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3097520,3102680,is anything in here hold on  no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3115119,3120558,let me through fishermen  i have no quarrel with you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3121440,3127359,fisherman  that's right i'm a goddamn ghost abc
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3127359,3132880,[ __ ]  now how about i turn you into one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3132880,3137880,this is a cool looking boss what in the  world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3138559,3144078,what's he doing  he's just gonna walk around slowly i  might be able to just
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3145359,3148759,oh come on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3153359,3159040,what is my ammo here really quick  oh my god he's so quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3162880,3167078,uh this ain't good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3170319,3176400,yes  different abilities i'm trying to figure  out too okay this is not good i gotta
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3176400,3180599,worry about him and all these enemies
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3185599,3190880,and i like the first one i did a lot of  damage to him that time not so much so
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3190880,3194519,maybe it's my ability
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3199920,3203318,i'm outta here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3210400,3213279,i got it let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3216880,3225480,why are they so tanky  oh my god there's so many i'm dead  100 i'm dead here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3241599,3247680,i'm out of okay  that hasn't been an ammo but the shotgun  does not so i gotta be cautious trying
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3247680,3251720,to kill him closely too
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3253839,3256559,border shells
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3260000,3265838,all right so  it doesn't just end when you kill the  boss so that's good to know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3275760,3281200,visual customization look there's some  pretty cool armor too whatever that was
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3281200,3288359,i wonder if it's cosmetic or the uh  actual thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3296400,3302480,hey let's go  this guy has a lot of hp what in the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3302480,3307318,world  gotta get close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3311119,3314359,got him
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3321200,3328000,there was no fisherman's ghost  just an insurgent dressing up in a  raincoat to scare off trespassers are
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3328000,3335839,you so sure i uh  got a boat  think it's time to get out of this place
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3335839,3340960,did he just drop  let me use my points really quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3342640,3347240,all right close range let's see what we  got here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3353359,3359760,your damage is increased by 10 for each  skill on cooldown  that's i think this is better overall
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3359760,3366160,that's cool you got different paths you  can take too  may change these up i i like all three
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3366160,3372640,of these i feel like this doesn't do a  lot of damage but also need to upgrade  it so  that makes sense
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3373520,3379119,all right that wasn't too bad first uh  first main boss and a good way to end  the video i feel like let me get more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3379119,3384319,ammo in case i get ambushed again  because you just never know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3387440,3392400,this is the uh take the boat across the  waterway let's do that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3392640,3396960,i guess you could fast travel back if  you really wanted to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3400240,3405839,i think i got everything  i didn't see any more loots
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3405839,3412119,something glowing over there must be the  oats from the other side  should be fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3421700,3428240,[Music]  where you go next  is the furthest i've ever been
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3428240,3433520,if black gulch is the belly of the beast  then this fortress is the jaws i fear
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3433520,3439839,for you in there outrider i wish you'd  reconsider you know i can't  there's no one else who can do this for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3439839,3448240,me  look  if i don't come back you  must or there'll be no tomorrow
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3448240,3451040,for any of us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3456160,3461839,all right that is it for now thank you  so much for watching if you want more of  this game just throw that like button i  kind of see how the first part does in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3461839,3468160,the first day and then i'll kind of just  go from there but love you all best  audience ever that's actually a lot of  fun i really like the challenge as well
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3468160,3473078,so all right love you all take it easy
vid,start,end,text
qFOcxBGmOjQ,799,6799,all right so earlier today i was looking  at when i covered the original outriders  campaign and i saw it was last april and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,6799,13200,i like lost my mind i was like there's  no way that's correct it feels like  three years ago there's been so many
qFOcxBGmOjQ,13200,19119,games that have dropped since then  anyways square enix actually hooked me  with this early shout out to them uh did  not get a chance to cover it early
qFOcxBGmOjQ,19119,24480,though so you know kind of defeats the  purpose there but kind of jumping and  playing when i can i covered the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,24480,31599,original story on ps5  and i thought it did pretty well i  really enjoyed playing it's kind of like  a remnant from the ashes type feeling i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,31599,36960,like the third person gears award type  vibe as well  so i'm playing on pc this time and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,36960,42719,apparently you can boost forward and get  to the highest level and then jump into  the new story so that's what i'm kind of  do for this video
qFOcxBGmOjQ,42719,49200,and he likes or droppings greatly  appreciate if i'll do a part one kind of  see how it goes if we hit like 20 000  likes in this first video
qFOcxBGmOjQ,49200,54719,probably do the full thing i have two  copies of this game to give away also  one for ps5 one for the series x been a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,54719,59840,chance to win either like the video or  leave a comment when you found my  youtube channel
qFOcxBGmOjQ,59840,66400,all right had to kind of start brand new  so i went ahead and kind of made a  character i thought look kind of cool  kind of old guy you know uh i don't have
qFOcxBGmOjQ,66400,71840,one on pc as you can see so oh no it  took it all away shouldn't take us long  to get back to it though i remember
qFOcxBGmOjQ,71840,77119,exactly what i did  uh that was that one hair color there  boom
qFOcxBGmOjQ,77119,82240,keep the markings  should we go uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,82720,87840,um  we'll do this one it's fine actually no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,87840,93439,let's do that it's not as uh overall  i guess too much going on you know all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,93439,100079,right  levy  all right uh let's just do brad
qFOcxBGmOjQ,100079,105600,here we go  think we're good let's go ahead and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,105600,110640,proceed to lobby i think this is where  yeah here we go  start the beginning no thanks we've done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,110640,116000,all this we're joined okay yeah here we  go such a path and boost your character  straight to level 30. all out writers
qFOcxBGmOjQ,116000,121840,content remains available through the  timeline okay  nice  all right here's where i don't know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,121840,127280,what's meta now  but i think i'm gonna go trickster again  because i really liked being up close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,127280,132800,you can slow down the enemies stuff like  that  uh technomancer long range i think i had
qFOcxBGmOjQ,132800,138959,a class for each of these on ps5  medium range
qFOcxBGmOjQ,138959,145280,let's do this  i one thought this was like the coolest  one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,145280,151200,yeah as trickster each enemy killed in  close range hills you're in grand shoe  portion of shield yep let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,152000,158560,i like how you can just jump right in  what look at all the stuff we got
qFOcxBGmOjQ,158959,164720,uh thank you august is thanking me for  like  i guess i completed the campaign and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,164720,169840,didn't realize it  select story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,169840,176000,so this is kind of showing you what we  did before  and now i guess yeah world slayer just  oh it just starts right after it so it's
qFOcxBGmOjQ,176000,182480,like on the same exact timeline too  uh this should be the beginning right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,182480,188400,here we go a powder apocalypse tear  what is this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,188400,193840,there were tears but it wasn't called  apocalypse i don't think  i could be wrong we're gonna find out
qFOcxBGmOjQ,193840,198120,here we go man jump it right in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,204400,210640,outrider the last drop pod should be  just up ahead got it drop me here and  find a sight to make camp better move
qFOcxBGmOjQ,210640,215200,fast out ryder  big storm coming
qFOcxBGmOjQ,216560,218959,great
qFOcxBGmOjQ,222319,229440,tahiti i found the bottom going in  looks like you're not the only one  trying to get at it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,234640,239680,oh wow  all right  playing on ultra settings here we go i  need to get the data from that pod
qFOcxBGmOjQ,239680,246000,before the storm hits  okay earn packs points to complete  various story points in the world slayer
qFOcxBGmOjQ,246000,255280,canvas that's brand new the pax tree  so apparently end game has been buffed  for this which i'm not there yet
qFOcxBGmOjQ,255280,261759,apocalypse tears okay  oh i see ascension level 26 apocalypse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,261759,267680,tier 15 on that one  our extensions of the current world okay  because it was world tears before
qFOcxBGmOjQ,267680,273040,push the boundaries further than before  okay  unlike world tiers pocket series can be
qFOcxBGmOjQ,273040,278639,leveled with any type of content they  scale difficulty  wherever you choose to play so you can  kind of keep the game easy if you want
qFOcxBGmOjQ,278639,284160,to just like before  all right ascension xp here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,284160,290160,killing enemies pretty much  straightforward ascension level 115 now  the end game might actually bring me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,290160,295440,back to this a lot i don't know we'll  see  um one thing i do want to see though i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,295440,301039,want to kind of test out  the melee going on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,301039,309160,that was where we make like the bullets  oh man aiming is so much easier than
qFOcxBGmOjQ,311600,318560,i wonder if they changed some of this  this game plays so good on pc what in  the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,320880,326560,so this i think this is the thing where  i make like a yeah slow down time bubble
qFOcxBGmOjQ,326560,331600,man this is sick  um all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,331600,339240,i'm gonna take some getting used to  this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,340720,343360,ice pockets
qFOcxBGmOjQ,347199,353440,yo man jumping back in playing this game  is kind of refreshing to be honest
qFOcxBGmOjQ,353440,359520,i am frozen right now  that's not good  by the way if i play this whole thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,359520,365440,i'll most likely uh  play solo just like i did the original
qFOcxBGmOjQ,365440,367840,story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,371199,375199,you need to hurry the storm is almost on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,378560,381840,if he comes over here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,390400,396800,yo i don't know if i'm supposed to be  fighting this thing to be honest  is he gone
qFOcxBGmOjQ,400240,406800,man that is cool  all right one thing i want to check  hold on inventory
qFOcxBGmOjQ,406880,413520,because there was other skills what was  the slash one  that was the one i really liked okay we  got the twisted rounds which is fine i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,413520,419280,don't like this  let me swap it out  that looks cool what is this one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,419280,426080,borrowed time  oh that's right okay  hunt the prey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,428000,433759,that's the one i like  i like that a lot the blade  the slow traps also good what was this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,433759,440319,last one time rift  it's all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,440960,446400,i i like this we're gonna play close  anyways all right class  this is kind of showing us i'm guessing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,446400,451639,it just i could reset the tree if i  wanted to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,452240,457520,shotgun master let's see what kind of  path they chose for me  cool thing is i can always undo this if
qFOcxBGmOjQ,457520,464319,i want to which i don't think it really  matters right now  not really quite sure how difficult the  game is going to actually be so all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,464319,472520,right here we go  that was a lot of fun  here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,485520,488759,every day
qFOcxBGmOjQ,492800,499120,oh you said these paws were protected no  no i have to pull this data before  everything's fried
qFOcxBGmOjQ,499490,502589,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,505599,512959,he was right  i didn't believe it  but the anomaly
qFOcxBGmOjQ,512959,519399,it's growing  exponentially now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,520959,527040,everything we did to bring these pods  down  weapons
qFOcxBGmOjQ,527040,534560,seeds for crops  all of our knowledge from earth
qFOcxBGmOjQ,534560,541680,in the end  none of it matters  if we don't find a way to stop what's
qFOcxBGmOjQ,541680,548760,coming  there will be nowhere on this planet for  us to hide
qFOcxBGmOjQ,549120,553160,maybe it's time we stop hiding
qFOcxBGmOjQ,564950,574680,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,582720,588959,that can't be good  all right here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,588959,593440,i want to test out this ability really  oh yeah
qFOcxBGmOjQ,594080,599839,so samus is getting used to everything  as you can tell it's been a while thiago  bailey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,599839,605760,[ __ ] lady stay with the pod  something's wrong
qFOcxBGmOjQ,605760,613279,it's not used to changing weapons with  the uh scroll wheel i like the one one  two three but in this game you got the  abilities on there so flocks of demon
qFOcxBGmOjQ,613279,620000,birds dropping from the sky  if they can't adapt to survive these  storms i don't want to know our odds the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,620000,629360,creatures here the anomalies always  mutated them fast enough before but  this shift happening now is too severe
qFOcxBGmOjQ,630079,635680,oh we just got  i haven't looked at my gear oh my  goodness all right so this is kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,635680,642160,where  i get addicted to stuff right  although i do look goofy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,642240,647360,i really wish uh  it didn't look as bad as it did but  we're gonna go through a lot of weapons
qFOcxBGmOjQ,647360,654320,a lot of gear  that's awesome though and you look at  the stuff you start with too  kind of glad i skipped forward
qFOcxBGmOjQ,654320,659600,because they said hey do you want to  cover it i was like yeah i'll check it  out and you know i'm not playing the  whole thing again
qFOcxBGmOjQ,659600,665760,not on my watch can i get in here  i guess we're going back this way here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,665760,671360,we go  hey thanks for all the support on my
qFOcxBGmOjQ,671360,677920,channel lately by the way this year has  been pretty slow up to like i wouldn't  say it did it's like an elden ring  dialed to a lot of the stuff that came
qFOcxBGmOjQ,677920,684240,out early first part of the year was  nice then it hit like a lull so kind of  getting near the end of that hopefully
qFOcxBGmOjQ,684240,690480,this fall can't get here fast enough am  i  right  i've been on youtube for over 12 years
qFOcxBGmOjQ,690480,696160,now and i just get idle hands  i don't like this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,698240,702600,i wish i used ability to hold on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,712160,715879,okay let me launch
qFOcxBGmOjQ,718079,725839,can't use abilities all right  come on good brad wrong gun
qFOcxBGmOjQ,727440,734399,this might be kind of a challenge but i  like that  i keep it on the world tier one for the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,734399,740399,apocalypse tier one  for a little while  most here's like the games i play on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,740399,745600,mouse and keyboard now i play uh  a lot of destiny too
qFOcxBGmOjQ,747279,753600,i believe is another one i was playing i  need to finish that game  let me get close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,754639,761720,it's a habit of me switching the weapons  i hit two to change my other gun
qFOcxBGmOjQ,793120,799600,this game plays like a dream to be  honest  i'm just it's kind of cool today
qFOcxBGmOjQ,799600,804399,third person why this plays better than  most games i've seen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,807760,813920,i'll figure out how to use my sidearm  but  if i get kills close i think it gives me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,813920,820160,health back  that's what i was saying  that stuff on the ground is kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,820160,824720,i can't really like  do anything about it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,827279,832160,should be enough there we go  oh okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,832480,839399,actually worse okay  we're gonna just collect everything we  can
qFOcxBGmOjQ,843839,850680,sensitivity feels pretty good right now  follow me back up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,856480,863440,all right apocalypse tier uh nudes here  unlocked i'm gonna keep it on this one  for a second because i remember i  struggled in the main story whenever i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,863440,869360,went too far ahead without getting  better gear  so i'm gonna just hang out here one for  a bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,869360,874720,not about to go crazy  all right here we go  yeah i'm trying to figure out like how
qFOcxBGmOjQ,874720,879760,to use because i i can only scroll  through the first two i know this one  usually gotta hold down something
qFOcxBGmOjQ,879760,884880,i might just look at the options here in  a minute automatic slug shotgun yeah  let's go ahead and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,884880,888240,uh change that there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,892560,899120,so both of these are better but i like  the ar better than the lmg  but i i mean it does
qFOcxBGmOjQ,899120,905360,have a lot more ammo i'll say that  crit damage to close range let's just  keep this one what does this also say
qFOcxBGmOjQ,905360,911120,shots generate shield okay  put that i'm just going to put the  highest stuff on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,911120,916240,whatever's the highest  i'm not even going to look at stats  right now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,916240,922240,okay should be good  to hang out here at apocalypse tier 1
qFOcxBGmOjQ,922240,928480,for a little bit  so how do i hold on if i can't swap to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,928480,934240,that  let me look at hold on let me look at my  uh options sorry i just it's bothering
qFOcxBGmOjQ,934240,939240,me right now  cuz i saw it on there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,941040,948560,it's like looking on swap weapons q  oh i can just hit q and swap as well  which is definitely odd
qFOcxBGmOjQ,949440,954800,i'm guessing a hold down q let's try it  there it is
qFOcxBGmOjQ,954800,960880,because on scroller you can't hold it  down so i can tap on these but i have to  hold this down to get it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,960880,966120,oh yeah  case i'm getting used to everything
qFOcxBGmOjQ,968320,975720,his shotgun is nice  join me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,983920,988720,damn it  if you guys have gotten yourselves eaten
qFOcxBGmOjQ,992480,997680,you can equip it right off the ground i  don't know if that was always there or  not get back up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,997680,1003920,it's actually pretty tight  i'm just excited there's something new
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1003920,1009680,to play because i was sitting at my desk  the other day like yo what am i gonna do  for most of five it's gonna be rough out
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1009680,1011839,here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1016800,1022079,all right kind of getting the hang of  everything  i think when i played the original story
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1022079,1026319,i had the music off i'm assuming it's  safe
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1028640,1034959,the way i view it is a lot of companies  want  like content creators to play their  games so now they're more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1034959,1040959,more friendly about it you know  ease it up a little bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1040959,1046079,all right sorry for the weird cut i had  to go ahead and change the keybinds  because it was really bugging me uh one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1046079,1051280,two three to change weapons  kind of what i prefer i'm also going to  keep q on there in case i get i don't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1051280,1056880,know which one's one or two sometimes uh  but at the same time  put all the abilities on the mouse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1056880,1062400,essentially mouse button four five and  then the top one  kind of feel like that'll be easier for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1062400,1067840,me there we go  we'll see how it goes i may change it  back  bailey
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1067840,1072159,where the hell are you out rider in here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1077679,1081720,are we just gonna dodge this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1088160,1093000,get up  what the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1096000,1101919,the fact that he freezes your abilities  is kind of crazy  oh boy betty get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1101919,1104320,off me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1107679,1111039,oh you down with me there we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1116320,1123679,yeah if a little more uh safe with that  setup  because  it was definitely tough the other way
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1123679,1126720,just restock okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1133200,1138559,gotta admit playing this game after  playing a lot of other games i this game  definitely feels optimized i'll say that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1138559,1140799,much
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1146160,1151080,it's another vision they just keep  getting worse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1162960,1171120,ooh it's too late  you can't save  you'll try  i shall consume you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1174240,1179840,jenna i'm not going anywhere  but you uh

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1201960,1205190,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1208720,1214559,yo look at the background  a bunch of those big guys are on the  move if it's true they can sense a storm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1214559,1218039,before it erupts
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1222960,1228159,the sound design for this game is what  kind of stands out to me the most is i  think i'm going to play on ps5 i didn't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1228159,1234520,have a headset on but like now i do  anytime i play on pc after
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1241840,1247760,i love the slowdown  like different abilities you can get  with different ones i tried all the  different classes out and i still think
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1247760,1252960,this is my absolute favorite  okay buddy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1258720,1265280,the way to the trucks clear we'll be  there  i know someone that might have answers
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1265280,1271919,about these ice storms  oh we got something there what is this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1271919,1277679,uh is it better than what i have  looks like it is going to equip it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1277679,1284080,all right here we go  that's cool how the uh story just kind  of progresses right off the ending you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1284080,1288760,know  it just keeps on moving
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1297840,1303640,oh god what happened we were here just  days ago
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1305039,1313720,this must be what i saw  in my vision  this is only how it begins
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1320210,1323359,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1333520,1340080,what is this  open stash do i even have anything  considering yeah it wouldn't be anything  in here i would imagine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1340080,1346799,it's all my backpack  shira do you read me
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1346799,1352320,shira alright  i can hear you what the hell happened  what does it look like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1352320,1358640,we thought it was just another storm  when we lost nearly everything on the  surface  anyone who couldn't move fast enough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1358640,1364159,where are you sheltered  i think last time
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1364159,1372039,yeah i don't think it makes sense to buy  anything look at this gun  rifle one shot okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1374559,1380799,she was talking then it just stopped uh  let me  let me go to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1380799,1386159,go look at everything right quick  i'm okay i might increase it here once
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1386159,1391840,let's go ahead and do that i'm just  curious  claim it and then
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1391840,1397280,i have that off so i guess  switch world tears
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1397280,1403240,the current oh you just tap it it's done  enemy health
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1403280,1408480,oh look okay what you get hold on gain  item level bonus two
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1408480,1413840,i'll go to two for now why not hasn't  been overly difficult yet
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1413840,1420799,i will put these on though if they're if  they're worth it  what we got here automatic
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1420799,1427760,double gun  i think i remember that i'm gonna keep  i could get rid of some of those as well
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1427760,1432880,i'm gonna each one  those don't have anything okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1432880,1440480,what do i do here i like the automatic  slug  but this one is a little
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1441360,1447279,i don't know  i think slug is the better of the two  even though it has less damage
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1447279,1452400,i could be wrong  i'll keep everything on now  i think we're fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1452400,1459120,i have ascension points so i haven't  used those okay this is all brand new i  know for a fact
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1459120,1464400,okay  anomaly endurance
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1466159,1474720,brutality  armor piercing i wonder what would be  like the best one to go through first
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1475120,1480960,i don't feel like that column's that  good next okay max health that actually  might help
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1483279,1491440,elite damage mitigation now that right  there sounds very useful for in-game  magazine size critical damage
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1491440,1498400,critical chance i like the dice roll  because there's always a chance  uh next weapon leech bonus
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1498960,1504960,i feel like i may just go like  what's like the is there a damage
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1504960,1512000,increase let's see close range weapon  damage bonus  long range
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1512000,1517919,this  this has to be good right  i'll do that and i'll do
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1517919,1526679,armor  actually can i let me res actually no  i'll just keep that it's fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1539279,1542279,uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1549760,1555919,shira  what happened  it's over  i thought the signal the pods is a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1555919,1561200,haiti's whole plan but  the anomaly destroys everything
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1561200,1569679,i don't know how we survived this  there might still be a way you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1569679,1575200,you traitor you think we're going to  find out sure what the hell  he's been sharing information with the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1575200,1580320,insurgents lieutenant i have to fight no  no we don't understand no he can save us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1580320,1587320,save what everything we've heard is  missions
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1602490,1605740,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1609200,1612440,get up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1614720,1620240,okay  who the hell you've been talking to  salvador
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1620240,1626960,francisco salvador  he's with the insurgents but he's a  scientist we just shared data
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1626960,1633600,and you didn't think to tell me you were  talking to the other side listen to me  what he found
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1633600,1641600,it could be an answer but he disappeared  before i got the final readings without  those yes uh don't salvador
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1641600,1650399,if he's even still alive where do i find  him he worked deep behind enemy lines in  a place called black gulch black gulch
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1650399,1656000,you don't want to go looking for that  place operator why what's there an  altered
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1656000,1663520,all we know is they call him the  commander black gulge is his  you won't come out of their life
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1663520,1669120,yeah well  nobody's coming out of this alive if no  one tries
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1669120,1671520,come on

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1684880,1693520,scientist who may have answers about  these storms we're looking for a place  called  black gulch no that place i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1693520,1699039,i keep seeing it as shadows dripping  shredding souls
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1699039,1704720,this is an evil place outrider but i may  know a way to get you behind enemy lines  unseen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1704720,1710799,there's an abandoned fishing village  called drift water  i'll explain on the way all right so we
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1710799,1717360,got here looks like okay irons used for  weapon upgrades armors uses leather uh  epic legendary required titanium
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1717360,1723600,apocalypse gear requires  anomaly extract okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1723600,1728960,exchanging mods requires a mod to be  unlocked in a collection in iron or  leather crazy attributes require
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1728960,1734159,attribute shards okay there's a lot to  take in but i like it  go up with friends we're not doing all
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1734159,1741278,that  i'm also playing this early i just saw  where it's not out yet

qFOcxBGmOjQ,1749200,1754960,i forgot you could actually just pretty  much change your character all the way  if you needed to  uh restock i think we've already done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1754960,1761760,that we don't really need to do too much  what is this thing  okay drop pods let's see
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1762640,1767840,oh it's preparing expeditions okay  these apocalypse tears got me kind of
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1767840,1770799,nervous but here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1775279,1779080,anything i can do for you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1780799,1786399,i'm actually gonna ask  i'm gonna ask all this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1786399,1793120,i'm sure it wasn't easy  growing up with jakob around  trying to be a dad
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1793120,1799039,believe me he was the least of it  being a kid in this  [ __ ] war
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1799039,1804960,i've heard stories  i can imagine  no you can't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1804960,1810159,you know you don't look much older than  me but i heard you got to magically jump
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1810159,1817279,over the past couple of decades  honestly you've got  no idea what it was like i'm growing up
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1817279,1824080,in this non-stop bloodbath  you have any idea what it's like  watching your whole [ __ ] planet die
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1824080,1830559,no [ __ ]  i'm sorry  you must have lost people
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1830559,1837840,yeah  yeah  we all did
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1843679,1851840,always love how they get back in  position before asking the next question  here we go these visions  how do you know they're real
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1853600,1859600,how do you know yours are real  i don't see the future just
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1859600,1867760,shitty things that have already happened  except once actually  the first time it happened i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1868960,1876440,i saw you  well  there you go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1881440,1888399,all right when did you start having  visions where did these visions come  from  the anomaly that killed my mom
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1888399,1895200,i ripped through a hut in the middle of  the night decided to spare me i just  [ __ ] with my head
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1895600,1901840,i'm sorry  the bad violent awful [ __ ] that's all i  ever see
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1901840,1910158,i was a kid when it happened  i used to think i was going insane  well what'd you figure out you weren't
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1910880,1916559,i'm still not so sure  how these visions
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1918840,1924799,work so you see the future  you can tell me when to dodge a bullet i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1924799,1929919,wish  uh that's not how it works i just get  flashes
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1929919,1935120,i  don't control it it just happens and  half the time i read it wrong but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1935120,1943518,corrigan was crazy about you  i get it right just often enough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1947440,1954080,looks like this is the last one  uh the truck makes it look like hell on  wheels nice
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1954080,1959919,so you can kind of customize everything  don't think i'll be doing too much of  that what is this thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1960559,1969279,that looks man us oh nice yo that's sick  is that the summon from final fantasy 7
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1969279,1974399,just thought about that  we got this one too i don't know where  these came from
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1974399,1978399,i'll never use an emotion worse
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1979840,1986080,that is so cool  like a collections tab and all that  all right i think we're good to go and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1986080,1993120,depart and get going with the story  gonna need snow treads for the truck  soon
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1994320,1998158,all right let's see rift town is where  we're at now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,1999919,2005840,he's doing really quick hold on main  story  oh so all the extra side quests if i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2005840,2011840,ever want to go back and do those i can  go back and do them now that's actually  pretty cool we dismissed that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2011840,2018760,now world slayer so yeah it's its own  thing started here now we're in rift  town now we're here so here we go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2019200,2024480,wonder how tough this is gonna be solo  it's gonna be sweaty i feel like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2029679,2037279,we're here  driftwater's up ahead okay thiago what  am i looking for a boat
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2037279,2043919,you'll need to find one at the harbor to  get across the water there  you should find a back way
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2043919,2050240,under the insurgent's walls  yo this mission looks already better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2050240,2055679,than the snow area  that snow area was not it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2057200,2062320,i think we're good  go ahead and just run around
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2063040,2068079,is this stuff coming from this collect  this should have been a good spot for us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2068079,2074638,thiago how do you know a way into this  fortress i was imprisoned there  tortured beyond
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2074638,2081200,i thought i was dead  but i managed to escape through the  sewers and stole a boat
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2081200,2086878,from here to the forest and  i never looked back the people who lived
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2086878,2092878,here in driftwater thiago  who were they an eca settlement before
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2092878,2098160,the war  there's nothing but ghosts here now what  happened to the villagers there's a
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2098160,2104960,story  of a night fisherman  whose daughter would ring the harbour  bell each dawn to call him home
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2104960,2111359,but one night  insurgents came in the fog  and the fishermen slept right through
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2111359,2116480,the entire village slaughtered  when the fishermen returned and saw
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2116480,2121920,he tore into the soldiers  didn't last long  the next day
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2121920,2128560,a thick fog rolled in and a figure  stopped through it  with a long wrinkled and bloody hook
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2128560,2134640,the fisherman's ghost  driven mad by guilt taking his revenge
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2134640,2141200,the harbor bell tolled for each  insurgent dead  they say you can hear the bell still
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2141200,2147440,tolling  yo this is like my favorite mission  already just because of the uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2147440,2155760,the ambiance or whatever you want to  call it  it almost feels like that swap level  from remnant from the ashes a little bit
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2156160,2162480,boy collect this  hmm  the journal
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2168480,2174240,gotta look around a little bit but  i haven't seen a single enemy which is  definitely unique
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2174240,2180410,he's only counted that i guess  yeah look at the atmosphere
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2180410,2183869,[Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2192320,2196880,just kind of chilling right now  i don't know what's gonna happen
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2198400,2204160,this will kind of explore as much as we  can  i'm thinking for this first video i'll  put this full mission and then after
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2204160,2209359,this one i'll probably stop and  that'll be like the part one if you  would like a part two just throw that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2209359,2215119,like button i'll see how this first  video does like the first day  and then start cranking them out if uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2215119,2221760,if need be you know what i mean  oh boy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2221760,2227680,oh boy here we go  a little capture point it'll be a nice  little fast travel moment if we really
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2227680,2234560,need to which i don't think we can go  anywhere from this point because we're  oh we go back to camp okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2234560,2236960,interesting
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2240160,2246960,why would there be an ammo thing there  yeah i mean like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2249920,2255640,i haven't really fought anything yet but  i did shoot some of those birds or  whatever
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2260160,2264078,i gotta go look for a boat sir here we  go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2269440,2274039,here it is  how convenient
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2284640,2288000,no boats on this pier
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2292640,2299079,ah  looks like there's one over there on  that dry dock
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2309119,2318680,what is that  survive the ambush oh boy we can hear  sharks it's insurgents it's the villages
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2327359,2330240,this is gonna be tough
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2336880,2344869,i can't use the ability right now oh  there  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2350800,2358839,i just use this wall as best i can  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2364400,2369319,man the gun play is just so good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2372720,2380000,aiming on mouse and keyboard is by far  way easier on most games i feel like i  don't like the aim assist debate but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2380000,2386000,games like apex  shooting long range on controller is a  nightmare
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2392480,2396920,kind of stop them for a second you know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2407760,2411839,it's just too long of rage i think on  that one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2412880,2417000,look how picky this guy is
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2429280,2435000,those times we used to farm the division  and the enemies
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2442400,2448720,come on buddy  a little bit more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2450880,2457200,there  [Music]
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2457200,2462800,the thing is this class doesn't benefit  from me sitting around you know i got to  get close to him
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2462800,2468559,which it's kind of a double edged sword  i'm thinking like do i just rush in  there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2472480,2480599,okay you know what  well we have a couple options here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2484319,2486800,going in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2492160,2496640,all right  now we're close range let's get it
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2498000,2504160,i gotta do it  come help back at least that's good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2504160,2507400,hold on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2512560,2519640,i'm sure i'm shooting out i just started  shooting at everything  because the names are all over
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2546000,2551079,i'm so low on bullets i just realized  that um
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2565040,2570480,far away but it really doesn't matter  okay oh okay
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2570480,2576319,just need to get to that boat on the dry  dock  and get the hell out of here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2576319,2582480,i'm gonna go loot everything i saw the  dropped on the ground whatever i didn't  get you know what i mean  because there was a lot of stuff done
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2582480,2591318,here  i was a little bit sweaty i'm not gonna  lie  i did not expect the uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2592000,2597760,i mean that was pretty wild to be honest  with you you had a lot going on and you  also it kind of brought me back to i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2597760,2604560,think one of the boss fights in the main  story dude i all kind of  came flooding back to my thoughts i  remember like you're having like storm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2604560,2610960,up this it's almost like a normandy type  thing  put that on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2611839,2618480,we'll take it  anything else better nope i know  statwise they're gonna have different  like skills and all that stuff like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2618480,2624480,uh uh yeah  the gun shield everything like that so  certain ones are better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2624480,2629599,i okay at this point i feel like the  damage on this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2629599,2636560,just needs to be changed so  double gun it's all close range
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2636560,2642560,that's good nice  and then this one put that on  i'll sell everything else once i get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2642560,2646200,back to the main area
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2648560,2655760,kind of want to test out this stuff  i think the slug is still stronger but
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2655760,2661599,we'll give this a shot  oh no we're not we're not using a single  burst right now
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2661599,2666720,when it said rifle i didn't know what it  was  they were gonna put that back on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2666720,2672000,and honestly  i'm putting that back on to you  i know the other ones have higher stats
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2672000,2679599,but certain archetypes are just better  than others  yeah this is way better
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2689359,2694960,i think a lot of people clump this game  into uh a column with like
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2696960,2703680,like avengers and  some stuff like that but i feel like  it's a little bit above that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2703680,2709520,you know like it's not  they didn't leave it for dead  essentially they're actually trying  something with it which i think this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2709520,2714560,will bring a lot of people back  i'm curious to see like the steam charts  and everything for it i know i'll be
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2714560,2722240,playing it for a little while  okay guys let's go baby
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2723359,2726160,oh easy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2730960,2738240,yeah the amount of bullets this thing  has versus the other one and on top of  that  the sheer damage is already good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2738240,2741960,some kind of writing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2751839,2754640,all right we're going in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2757839,2762160,the effects are very satisfying say the  least
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2767119,2772040,look at that gilly suit that's actually  kind of clean
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2775280,2781920,all right so gun play is definitely  satisfying  one of the things that brings people  back to destiny 2 i feel like is the no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2781920,2787839,matter what the gun plays always been  top-notch even if the game is in like a  rough area sometimes it's like the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2787839,2791680,overall game itself is just nice
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2801440,2807119,i know once we inspect this boat it's  gonna be off all craziness so let me  loot up everything i can
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2807119,2812240,restock  there's two restocks is there something  up there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2812240,2817839,oh there's the other chest right there  how do i get up there only steps really  quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2823839,2830720,i am highly impressed by how this game  has been uh performing so far too  like on the pc i have
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2830720,2835839,that looks insane  bolt action though in the middle of a  gunfight that might be pretty good for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2835839,2840960,like a long range  uh but  the thing is my class isn't really built
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2840960,2844200,like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2855119,2860079,oh damn it  this boat's a wreck
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2870079,2875760,is  that the fisherman  no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2875760,2880960,no there's no way  that can't be some fisherman's ghost
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2880960,2887480,i need to get a crib  letting thiago's stories get to my head
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2889920,2895280,all right investigate the new arrival  something strange  a fog moving in over the river
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2895280,2901039,there's a light in it  you need to leave this place i'm
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2904800,2913480,here they come  oh you you got to be kidding
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2915119,2919838,all right it might be best to just  do this
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2923359,2928799,help back  if we even need to  i thought
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2932319,2938960,hey let's go  i might just hold back here for a second
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2941280,2945280,except to try out that sniper to be  honest
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2946400,2952960,should i do it  let's see if this thing actually lands  here  the accuracy is insane what in the world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2952960,2959040,the problem is i can't really go to my  inventory because doesn't fall off the  game  that's a cool mask whatever the hunt
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2959040,2966079,masters mask that's just so sick i'm  gonna run for it  or maybe i'm not
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2966160,2971838,doing gracious  what  uh
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2972800,2975359,hit me right there
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2979359,2985480,i don't know what to do here  i'm literally like pen dead can i go  around
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2988800,2995640,maybe i can circle around them i don't  know i gotta get close all right my my  abilities
qFOcxBGmOjQ,2998960,3005839,there we go  there's something working  i got the vantage point baby let's go i
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3005839,3009880,have the high ground now let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3013839,3016160,all right
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3020800,3028880,got ascension points let me go ahead and  pop these  uh let's do health and
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3031760,3038000,resistance  now weapon leech is nice if you get oct  if you get a slug shoddy
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3038000,3044960,the full auto one obviously uh with  healing and like the weapon leech it's  so good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3049520,3055680,armor piercing bonus  i'm torn because it's like i don't know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3055680,3061680,the power for that slash should be nice  but it's it's gonna slowly go up over  time
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3062640,3068400,i feel like just raw damage of  everything else or just having better  health
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3068400,3071279,armor piercing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3073440,3078960,i gotta i have to see something really  quick  armor piercing let's get that like that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3078960,3083838,and flat damage boost are probably gonna  be the best few you can get
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3087119,3092319,like i said it's gonna take me some  getting used to everything but i think  the progress i've made so far in this  first
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3092319,3097079,long video has been pretty good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3097520,3102680,is anything in here hold on  no
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3115119,3120558,let me through fishermen  i have no quarrel with you
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3121440,3127359,fisherman  that's right i'm a goddamn ghost abc
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3127359,3132880,[ __ ]  now how about i turn you into one
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3132880,3137880,this is a cool looking boss what in the  world
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3138559,3144078,what's he doing  he's just gonna walk around slowly i  might be able to just
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3145359,3148759,oh come on
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3153359,3159040,what is my ammo here really quick  oh my god he's so quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3162880,3167078,uh this ain't good
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3170319,3176400,yes  different abilities i'm trying to figure  out too okay this is not good i gotta
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3176400,3180599,worry about him and all these enemies
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3185599,3190880,and i like the first one i did a lot of  damage to him that time not so much so
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3190880,3194519,maybe it's my ability
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3199920,3203318,i'm outta here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3210400,3213279,i got it let's go
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3216880,3225480,why are they so tanky  oh my god there's so many i'm dead  100 i'm dead here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3241599,3247680,i'm out of okay  that hasn't been an ammo but the shotgun  does not so i gotta be cautious trying
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3247680,3251720,to kill him closely too
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3253839,3256559,border shells
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3260000,3265838,all right so  it doesn't just end when you kill the  boss so that's good to know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3275760,3281200,visual customization look there's some  pretty cool armor too whatever that was
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3281200,3288359,i wonder if it's cosmetic or the uh  actual thing
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3296400,3302480,hey let's go  this guy has a lot of hp what in the
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3302480,3307318,world  gotta get close
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3311119,3314359,got him
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3321200,3328000,there was no fisherman's ghost  just an insurgent dressing up in a  raincoat to scare off trespassers are
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3328000,3335839,you so sure i uh  got a boat  think it's time to get out of this place
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3335839,3340960,did he just drop  let me use my points really quick
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3342640,3347240,all right close range let's see what we  got here
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3353359,3359760,your damage is increased by 10 for each  skill on cooldown  that's i think this is better overall
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3359760,3366160,that's cool you got different paths you  can take too  may change these up i i like all three
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3366160,3372640,of these i feel like this doesn't do a  lot of damage but also need to upgrade  it so  that makes sense
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3373520,3379119,all right that wasn't too bad first uh  first main boss and a good way to end  the video i feel like let me get more
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3379119,3384319,ammo in case i get ambushed again  because you just never know
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3387440,3392400,this is the uh take the boat across the  waterway let's do that
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3392640,3396960,i guess you could fast travel back if  you really wanted to
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3400240,3405839,i think i got everything  i didn't see any more loots
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3405839,3412119,something glowing over there must be the  oats from the other side  should be fine
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3421700,3428240,[Music]  where you go next  is the furthest i've ever been
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3428240,3433520,if black gulch is the belly of the beast  then this fortress is the jaws i fear
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3433520,3439839,for you in there outrider i wish you'd  reconsider you know i can't  there's no one else who can do this for
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3439839,3448240,me  look  if i don't come back you  must or there'll be no tomorrow
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3448240,3451040,for any of us
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3456160,3461839,all right that is it for now thank you  so much for watching if you want more of  this game just throw that like button i  kind of see how the first part does in
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3461839,3468160,the first day and then i'll kind of just  go from there but love you all best  audience ever that's actually a lot of  fun i really like the challenge as well
qFOcxBGmOjQ,3468160,3473078,so all right love you all take it easy
