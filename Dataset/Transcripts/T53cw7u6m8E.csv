T53cw7u6m8E,122479,125200,came sort of the way our stories always
T53cw7u6m8E,125200,127280,do which is um
T53cw7u6m8E,127280,129360,we spent a lot of time just figuring out
T53cw7u6m8E,129360,131200,the character stuff and then we just
T53cw7u6m8E,131200,132160,like
T53cw7u6m8E,132160,134160,sprinkle in the crazy later you know
T53cw7u6m8E,134160,137040,just sprinkle in some dildo i guess

T53cw7u6m8E,139680,142800,to have to go on a on a hit because
T53cw7u6m8E,142800,144800,what she's really wrestling with is like
T53cw7u6m8E,144800,146720,this violence she's being forced to
T53cw7u6m8E,146720,148879,commit over and over again
T53cw7u6m8E,148879,151440,um and the cost that it's bearing on her
T53cw7u6m8E,151440,154080,soul she just doesn't want to be this
T53cw7u6m8E,154080,156640,weapon the dildo sequence
T53cw7u6m8E,156640,157680,was
T53cw7u6m8E,157680,160080,the most fun i've had on an action
T53cw7u6m8E,160080,161120,sequence
T53cw7u6m8E,161120,164080,ever i think uh not only because it's
T53cw7u6m8E,164080,167440,ridiculous um it's just you know as a
T53cw7u6m8E,167440,168400,viewer
T53cw7u6m8E,168400,170879,it's insane i mean
T53cw7u6m8E,170879,172800,i don't think it's ever been done in the
T53cw7u6m8E,172800,177610,history of television ever before
T53cw7u6m8E,177610,186780,[Music]
T53cw7u6m8E,187519,190400,meredith glenn who is the uh who's the
T53cw7u6m8E,190400,192720,writer and uh she pitched it
T53cw7u6m8E,192720,195120,and she said well you know he's she's
T53cw7u6m8E,195120,196560,going up against the super gross
T53cw7u6m8E,196560,198319,oligarch who's got all these hookers
T53cw7u6m8E,198319,200800,around so like what if she uses all of
T53cw7u6m8E,200800,203360,his own sex toys against him and so then
T53cw7u6m8E,203360,205599,our our props master had
T53cw7u6m8E,205599,208080,the best time ever
T53cw7u6m8E,208080,210720,coming up with like what were each
T53cw7u6m8E,210720,211680,seven
T53cw7u6m8E,211680,213920,dildo like they're amazing like the
T53cw7u6m8E,213920,216080,flounder pounder for the deep and the
T53cw7u6m8E,216080,219680,high speed [ __ ] for a train and
T53cw7u6m8E,219680,221840,and translucent i think the invisible
T53cw7u6m8E,221840,222879,[ __ ]
T53cw7u6m8E,222879,225599,and the home banger oh wait which one
T53cw7u6m8E,225599,228400,black noise silence screamer starbraider
T53cw7u6m8E,228400,230879,the dildos are supposed to kind of
T53cw7u6m8E,230879,233360,work as cauli stix it's a form of
T53cw7u6m8E,233360,235120,martial art and i had never done that
T53cw7u6m8E,235120,236480,before so
T53cw7u6m8E,236480,238400,it's funny because they're dildos but at
T53cw7u6m8E,238400,240159,the same time we have to be very like
T53cw7u6m8E,240159,241519,accurate with
T53cw7u6m8E,241519,242799,all the moves
T53cw7u6m8E,242799,245680,and by the time we got to shooting i
T53cw7u6m8E,245680,248239,knew the uh i knew the choreography so
T53cw7u6m8E,248239,250080,well that we could change things on the
T53cw7u6m8E,250080,255159,day we added some wire work in there
T53cw7u6m8E,266479,268800,it's this moment where she realizes
T53cw7u6m8E,268800,271280,she's turned into the monster that she
T53cw7u6m8E,271280,274080,has always tried to fight off that was a
T53cw7u6m8E,274080,276320,tragic wake-up call
T53cw7u6m8E,276320,278080,the girls were you know i mean
T53cw7u6m8E,278080,279520,everyone's covered in blood at that
T53cw7u6m8E,279520,282160,point but um yeah cause kimiko is only
T53cw7u6m8E,282160,284560,trying to help in that moment and
T53cw7u6m8E,284560,288080,in her mind she is
T53cw7u6m8E,288240,289360,saving them
T53cw7u6m8E,289360,291520,out of this situation but they see her
T53cw7u6m8E,291520,293440,as a monster crimes committed with
T53cw7u6m8E,293440,297759,inbought by ceo stan edgar
T53cw7u6m8E,297759,300479,and in the coming days the fbsa will be
T53cw7u6m8E,300479,302639,investigating charges of blackmail
T53cw7u6m8E,302639,304960,perjury and obstruction of justice
T53cw7u6m8E,304960,307199,against mr edgar
T53cw7u6m8E,307199,309360,vaught international must be held to the
T53cw7u6m8E,309360,312400,highest ethical and legal standards
T53cw7u6m8E,312400,314560,what did you do
T53cw7u6m8E,314560,315919,something i should have done a long time
T53cw7u6m8E,315919,319840,ago that's a huge uh uh
T53cw7u6m8E,319840,322560,deep kind of wound for her i think
T53cw7u6m8E,322560,323600,because
T53cw7u6m8E,323600,325919,stan edgar is essentially like a father
T53cw7u6m8E,325919,326960,to her
T53cw7u6m8E,326960,329280,granted she uh
T53cw7u6m8E,329280,330320,starts
T53cw7u6m8E,330320,332000,kind of clocking that
T53cw7u6m8E,332000,334880,that she is also just another
T53cw7u6m8E,334880,337039,puppet of his or a tool that he
T53cw7u6m8E,337039,339440,manipulates as he does everyone around
T53cw7u6m8E,339440,342880,him um successfully so
T53cw7u6m8E,342880,343840,um
T53cw7u6m8E,343840,345039,it does
T53cw7u6m8E,345039,347520,cost her and she and she also knows that
T53cw7u6m8E,347520,349600,like the person she's getting into bed
T53cw7u6m8E,349600,353600,with business lies is is insane so
T53cw7u6m8E,353600,355600,for someone who likes to operate from
T53cw7u6m8E,355600,356720,strategy
T53cw7u6m8E,356720,358800,and kind of play it as chess and kind of
T53cw7u6m8E,358800,360560,assess each person in front of her and
T53cw7u6m8E,360560,362560,what cards to pull and what to and what
T53cw7u6m8E,362560,365520,you know buttons to switch on
T53cw7u6m8E,365520,367120,she's in a very she's in a very
T53cw7u6m8E,367120,368639,unfamiliar territory she has to make
T53cw7u6m8E,368639,370160,desperate decisions
T53cw7u6m8E,370160,372880,and so i think she knows that
T53cw7u6m8E,372880,374160,the decision she's making is going to
T53cw7u6m8E,374160,376240,benefit her right now but ultimately
T53cw7u6m8E,376240,379880,she's going to pay the price
T53cw7u6m8E,390639,392400,that was a really tough one i spoke to
T53cw7u6m8E,392400,394479,eric about that too about that decision
T53cw7u6m8E,394479,396880,because essentially it's the same thing
T53cw7u6m8E,396880,399120,that happened to her as a child
T53cw7u6m8E,399120,401440,and that cost her greatly that's an
T53cw7u6m8E,401440,403280,intense
T53cw7u6m8E,403280,405199,thing to do then to turn around and to
T53cw7u6m8E,405199,406720,do that to your own daughter the thing
T53cw7u6m8E,406720,408080,the person she cares about most in the
T53cw7u6m8E,408080,410240,world or like the the the the person
T53cw7u6m8E,410240,411840,she's doing everything for and she wants
T53cw7u6m8E,411840,413440,to protect her daughter how do you
T53cw7u6m8E,413440,415520,protect your daughter without
T53cw7u6m8E,415520,417520,seeing that as an option
T53cw7u6m8E,417520,418400,um
T53cw7u6m8E,418400,419919,i think that costs her i think that cost
T53cw7u6m8E,419919,421840,her the most in the season even more so
T53cw7u6m8E,421840,424319,than stan edgar who's a handsome petty
T53cw7u6m8E,424319,427039,little gerbil
T53cw7u6m8E,427039,429840,it's a hamster
T53cw7u6m8E,430639,431919,well my daughter went through three of
T53cw7u6m8E,431919,432800,them
T53cw7u6m8E,432800,434720,so jamie is a character from the books
T53cw7u6m8E,434720,437360,uh he's not super powered
T53cw7u6m8E,437360,439039,but he is a hamster when we were
T53cw7u6m8E,439039,440800,breaking the story in the russian lab
T53cw7u6m8E,440800,442720,and that there's a lot of creepy
T53cw7u6m8E,442720,444960,you know compound v testing on soldier
T53cw7u6m8E,444960,446960,boy and what other testing would they
T53cw7u6m8E,446960,448479,have been doing it sort of started to
T53cw7u6m8E,448479,450560,make sense that you know there would be
T53cw7u6m8E,450560,453360,hamsters in there and and
T53cw7u6m8E,453360,454960,we all just kind of at once said oh my
T53cw7u6m8E,454960,456560,god it could be jamie we can finally
T53cw7u6m8E,456560,458080,bring in jamie in the beginning we're
T53cw7u6m8E,458080,460479,like oh how cute it's adorable
T53cw7u6m8E,460479,462000,oh jamie
T53cw7u6m8E,462000,463120,and then
T53cw7u6m8E,463120,465199,things quickly turn jamie's the homie
T53cw7u6m8E,465199,469680,though he kind of uh he saves frenchie
T53cw7u6m8E,472410,475499,[Music]
T53cw7u6m8E,477199,478960,i don't know where he goes after that
T53cw7u6m8E,478960,481199,but i'd like to think maybe he could be
T53cw7u6m8E,481199,483759,a new addition for the boys i i don't
T53cw7u6m8E,483759,485759,have no idea how to get him back into
T53cw7u6m8E,485759,486960,the story
T53cw7u6m8E,486960,489440,but i do not want this to be the last of
T53cw7u6m8E,489440,490800,jamie like
T53cw7u6m8E,490800,492800,he's loose there's this super powered
T53cw7u6m8E,492800,494960,bloodthirsty hamster
T53cw7u6m8E,494960,498080,um loose somewhere in russia
T53cw7u6m8E,498080,500240,and like i'm i'm i'm dying to figure out
T53cw7u6m8E,500240,504199,how to get him back in the story
T53cw7u6m8E,515440,518440,evening
T53cw7u6m8E,522880,524959,what you come to understand this season
T53cw7u6m8E,524959,527600,is that you know butcher really views
T53cw7u6m8E,527600,529519,huey like his
T53cw7u6m8E,529519,532160,his young brother lenny uh and the last
T53cw7u6m8E,532160,533920,thing butcher would ever want to do is
T53cw7u6m8E,533920,534959,is
T53cw7u6m8E,534959,537839,jeopardize hughie and and put him in a
T53cw7u6m8E,537839,539920,in in some sort of mortal danger and if
T53cw7u6m8E,539920,541279,you know
T53cw7u6m8E,541279,544160,butcher desperately tries to
T53cw7u6m8E,544160,547440,dissuade him from making that
T53cw7u6m8E,547440,549120,same choice that butch has made because
T53cw7u6m8E,549120,550800,butcher fundamentally knows that it's
T53cw7u6m8E,550800,552880,morally the wrong choice
T53cw7u6m8E,552880,554640,um but butcher's going to do it anyway
T53cw7u6m8E,554640,556000,because he's butchered
T53cw7u6m8E,556000,558160,um so yeah you know butcher's uh
T53cw7u6m8E,558160,561120,incredibly disappointed and um and angry
T53cw7u6m8E,561120,562959,with huey that he's gone behind his back
T53cw7u6m8E,562959,564959,and done this thing but once that line
T53cw7u6m8E,564959,568000,is crossed having an additional
T53cw7u6m8E,568000,571440,uh super powered uh ally on your side is
T53cw7u6m8E,571440,573600,of benefit then
T53cw7u6m8E,573600,576560,then it's uh you know it's uh all the
T53cw7u6m8E,576560,579959,chips are down
T53cw7u6m8E,600880,603279,so the first thing i filmed my first day
T53cw7u6m8E,603279,606079,on set was uh stepping out of the the
T53cw7u6m8E,606079,608079,cryogenic chamber whatever they had me
