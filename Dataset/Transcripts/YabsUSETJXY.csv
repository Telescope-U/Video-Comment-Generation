YabsUSETJXY,40,1360,"Hi, I'm Josh."
YabsUSETJXY,1360,1800,I'm Ollie.
YabsUSETJXY,1800,2880,And I'm Mr. Z.
YabsUSETJXY,2880,7000,And today we have our resident Italian chef with us.
YabsUSETJXY,7000,9760,And Bond villain.
YabsUSETJXY,9760,13760,"To rate some JOLLY British,"
YabsUSETJXY,13760,18600,but Italian-inspired food.
YabsUSETJXY,19320,22240,"We have gathered some of the most common,"
YabsUSETJXY,22240,25520,Italian items eaten in British supermarkets.
YabsUSETJXY,25520,28400,A lot of these I ate quite often in university.
YabsUSETJXY,28400,29119,"Oh, really?"
YabsUSETJXY,29120,30120,Yeah.
YabsUSETJXY,30120,31560,I am actually quite nervous about this.
YabsUSETJXY,31560,33040,I know. I'm nervous.
YabsUSETJXY,33040,35520,"I wasn't nervous until we brought you in here,"
YabsUSETJXY,35520,36800,and started telling you about it.
YabsUSETJXY,36800,38480,We're starting at the basics.
YabsUSETJXY,38480,40239,It's a student classic.
YabsUSETJXY,40240,42720,It's bachelor's pasta sauce.
YabsUSETJXY,42720,44880,Pasta ‘n’ sauce.
YabsUSETJXY,46320,48280,I’m so sorry.
YabsUSETJXY,48280,52000,I don't believe you ever had this in your life.
YabsUSETJXY,52000,53800,Have you had this in your life?
YabsUSETJXY,53800,54559,Definitely.
YabsUSETJXY,54560,56920,This was the sort of thing in university we'd have all the time.
YabsUSETJXY,56920,59000,Have you ever had it?
YabsUSETJXY,59000,60200,Of course not.
YabsUSETJXY,60200,61360,Do you want to take a look at it?
YabsUSETJXY,61360,64360,What it looks like unprepared?
YabsUSETJXY,64360,65360,It's actual pasta.
YabsUSETJXY,65360,65840,It is.
YabsUSETJXY,65840,67439,It’s dried pasta.
YabsUSETJXY,69480,71080,"No, it's not edible."
YabsUSETJXY,72800,74720,Stir in chorizo for extra flavour.
YabsUSETJXY,74720,77400,Chorizo is not even Italian.
YabsUSETJXY,77400,78760,It's Spanish.
YabsUSETJXY,78760,82160,The first Italian-inspired British dish.
YabsUSETJXY,82160,83160,It's saucy.
YabsUSETJXY,83160,83800,It is saucy.
YabsUSETJXY,83800,85440,Did you add sauce to this?
YabsUSETJXY,85440,87960,"No, that's literally just powder with some water."
YabsUSETJXY,87960,89840,"Wow, incredible."
YabsUSETJXY,89840,94159,You've cooked for some of the most famous powerful people in the world.
YabsUSETJXY,94160,97600,"We may be giving you some shortcuts here, you know."
YabsUSETJXY,97600,99000,Next time the queen rolls up.
YabsUSETJXY,99000,102080,"And she's like, I just need pasta sauce."
YabsUSETJXY,102080,102640,And just like.
YabsUSETJXY,102640,106200,"“Your royal maj highness, I got pasta ‘n’ sauce coming right up”."
YabsUSETJXY,106200,108280,"Let's try it first, shall we?"
YabsUSETJXY,112600,114520,There's a base of tomato paste and ketchup.
YabsUSETJXY,114520,117479,"I can feel some dry basil, some dry garlic and some dry onion."
YabsUSETJXY,117480,118480,And some dried chilli.
YabsUSETJXY,118480,120160,"Oh wow, you're getting all that. Alright."
YabsUSETJXY,120160,122480,I would not eat it.
YabsUSETJXY,122480,124320,Would you serve it though?
YabsUSETJXY,124320,126159,I…
YabsUSETJXY,126160,128160,…would not serve it.
YabsUSETJXY,128160,129880,So I'm getting the feeling it hasn't done
YabsUSETJXY,129880,131880,a good representation of Italian tomato-based pasta.
YabsUSETJXY,131880,134520,"No, but the leaf was nice."
YabsUSETJXY,134520,138280,"Next up, I have a medium of food that us brits love."
YabsUSETJXY,138280,139400,It's canned food.
YabsUSETJXY,139400,140760,Oh.
YabsUSETJXY,140760,144319,I prefer dried food.
YabsUSETJXY,144320,148360,"No, what the **** is this."
YabsUSETJXY,148360,152480,Italian-style beans with garlic and basil.
YabsUSETJXY,152480,154560,What does it mean?
YabsUSETJXY,154560,156640,"Ok, there's a blurb."
YabsUSETJXY,156640,157960,Shall I read it in an Italian accent?
YabsUSETJXY,157960,159520,With a stereotyped Italian accent.
YabsUSETJXY,159520,160160,Okay.
YabsUSETJXY,160160,162560,"Well, I guarantee that's what it's going to be."
YabsUSETJXY,162560,163280,Go for it.
YabsUSETJXY,163280,166480,"A delicious comforting meal,"
YabsUSETJXY,166480,167560,with a tasty blend.
YabsUSETJXY,167560,169760,Why is he Mario?
YabsUSETJXY,169760,174560,Berlotti and connlini beans.
YabsUSETJXY,174560,177720,What are you doing with your fingers?
YabsUSETJXY,177720,179360,It’s only one sentence.
YabsUSETJXY,179360,182360,"Bellotti and cannellini beans, is this a thing in Italy?"
YabsUSETJXY,182360,184960,Uh no.
YabsUSETJXY,184960,188080,"Bellotti is a type of bean, cannellini is a type of bean."
YabsUSETJXY,188080,190080,But you wouldn't have this on toast in Italy?
YabsUSETJXY,190080,191560,No
YabsUSETJXY,191560,194319,"Oh, do you smell it?"
YabsUSETJXY,194320,195800,Good lord.
YabsUSETJXY,195800,199080,I think my cat has better cat food.
YabsUSETJXY,199080,201080,Your cat eats better than this?
YabsUSETJXY,201080,203040,That is not a good start.
YabsUSETJXY,203040,205480,This is what I prepared earlier.
YabsUSETJXY,208560,210280,Let's do it.
YabsUSETJXY,210280,211480,Come on.
YabsUSETJXY,211480,213319,Go on.
YabsUSETJXY,213320,215600,Italian style beans.
YabsUSETJXY,215600,219000,"Italian style beans, it's literally what it's called."
YabsUSETJXY,219000,220960,The pasta is 10 times better than this.
YabsUSETJXY,220960,221800,Oh gosh.
YabsUSETJXY,221800,222600,This is not good.
YabsUSETJXY,222600,225800,They actually taste surprisingly like baked beans.
YabsUSETJXY,225800,227680,just with a few herbs thrown in.
YabsUSETJXY,227680,231439,I don't like baked beans but these are worse than normal baked beans.
YabsUSETJXY,231440,234240,Do you have a competition between who has the best dishes?
YabsUSETJXY,234240,234840,We can.
YabsUSETJXY,234840,237080,So the first round goes to Josh.
YabsUSETJXY,237080,239960,One fork up.
YabsUSETJXY,239960,240960,What does the winner get?
YabsUSETJXY,240960,242600,The winner gets a negroni.
YabsUSETJXY,242600,244040,Oh~.
YabsUSETJXY,244040,247200,"- Hello, now we're talking. - I’m up for that."
YabsUSETJXY,247200,249760,I will now attempt to break the world record
YabsUSETJXY,249760,253439,for the number of Italian meatballs consumed in 1 minute.
YabsUSETJXY,253440,255120,3 2 1.

YabsUSETJXY,300800,302680,Your time is up.
YabsUSETJXY,302680,305160,How many was the record?
YabsUSETJXY,305160,307240,32.
YabsUSETJXY,307240,309840,32?
YabsUSETJXY,309840,312480,Oh.
YabsUSETJXY,312480,314600,I'm going back to Italian inspired.
YabsUSETJXY,314600,316840,You know it means that they probably use a little bit of liberties.
YabsUSETJXY,316840,318080,You're hedging your bets a little bit.
YabsUSETJXY,318080,321120,Italian-inspired spaghetti carbonara.
YabsUSETJXY,321120,323560,I'm scared about this.
YabsUSETJXY,323560,324720,A British classic.
YabsUSETJXY,324720,327000,There's a medium-fat hard cheese inside.
YabsUSETJXY,327000,327800,What does it mean?
YabsUSETJXY,327800,329960,"Oh, look at this."
YabsUSETJXY,329960,331840,So I can smell the bacon.
YabsUSETJXY,331840,333360,That's it.
YabsUSETJXY,333360,334599,Oh yeah.
YabsUSETJXY,334600,335240,Oh wow.
YabsUSETJXY,335240,337639,There's literally nothing.
YabsUSETJXY,337640,339720,The sauce needs to be heated up to release the aromas.
YabsUSETJXY,339720,340720,I’m getting some stuff.
YabsUSETJXY,340720,342560,Yeah?
YabsUSETJXY,342560,343800,Medium fat.
YabsUSETJXY,343800,346360,Shut up.
YabsUSETJXY,346360,349639,The key of carbonara is to have the egg without cream.
YabsUSETJXY,349640,354360,Raw that the eggs cook with the pasta.
YabsUSETJXY,354360,357039,- Gabie's done that for me before. - I feel like there's no eggs here.
YabsUSETJXY,357040,357760,Are you ready?
YabsUSETJXY,357760,359400,Don't put basil on top of the carbonara.
YabsUSETJXY,359400,362160,We put basil on everything.
YabsUSETJXY,362160,363120,Don’t tell us now.
YabsUSETJXY,363120,365960,This is inspired.
YabsUSETJXY,365960,367080,This looks terrible.
YabsUSETJXY,367080,369479,"Carbonara, it means of coal."
YabsUSETJXY,369480,371120,"Because when you eat it,"
YabsUSETJXY,371120,374800,there's so much blackpepper that is nearly black.
YabsUSETJXY,374800,376639,"And that's why they call it carbonara,"
YabsUSETJXY,376640,377960,because usually it's grey-black.
YabsUSETJXY,377960,380360,So I'm gonna try to start with one spaghetti.
YabsUSETJXY,382280,383000,Look at that.
YabsUSETJXY,383000,384520,Whoa!
YabsUSETJXY,384520,385039,Look at that.
YabsUSETJXY,385040,386960,Looks… fantastic.
YabsUSETJXY,392840,393840,Creamy?
YabsUSETJXY,393840,395440,Yeah?
YabsUSETJXY,395440,396520,Yeah.
YabsUSETJXY,396520,397520,Can you taste the inspiration?
YabsUSETJXY,397520,400240,It's not very good.
YabsUSETJXY,400240,401639,He's being so polite.
YabsUSETJXY,401640,403320,“It's not very good.”
YabsUSETJXY,403320,407320,It tastes like cream but they added water to the cream.
YabsUSETJXY,407320,410400,"So, it's a very watery cream."
YabsUSETJXY,410400,412000,Like an aguanara.
YabsUSETJXY,412000,413360,What's an aguanara?
YabsUSETJXY,413360,415719,"Well, it's like a carbonara but with agua."
YabsUSETJXY,415720,417320,That's Spanish.
YabsUSETJXY,424640,428120,"- Miscenallaenus southern European language. - Look, it was inspired."
YabsUSETJXY,428120,430000,"For my round now, I have something,"
YabsUSETJXY,430000,432640,that I consume at least once a week.
YabsUSETJXY,432640,435120,The Italian-style breadstick.
YabsUSETJXY,435120,436040,"Of course, yeah."
YabsUSETJXY,436040,437240,Have some grissini.
YabsUSETJXY,437240,440039,"So surely in Italy, that's not what breadsticks look like."
YabsUSETJXY,440040,440840,"No, not at all."
YabsUSETJXY,440840,441880,Cheers.
YabsUSETJXY,448640,449760,The texture is not bad.
YabsUSETJXY,449760,451240,"It's very light, very chemical."
YabsUSETJXY,451240,453120,How does this taste like styrofoam as well?
YabsUSETJXY,453120,454320,I was just going to say-
YabsUSETJXY,454320,456440,"It tastes like styrofoam, that's what I mean."
YabsUSETJXY,456440,457680,"Sorry I was going to say,"
YabsUSETJXY,457680,459240,We get ours from Sainsbury's.
YabsUSETJXY,459240,464120,This has way more flavour.
YabsUSETJXY,464120,465360,"You know in Italy, we do like this."
YabsUSETJXY,467280,469520,Wow!
YabsUSETJXY,474200,478680,Why do you look so insane doing it?
YabsUSETJXY,478680,480919,He made it look natural.
YabsUSETJXY,480920,483000,You look like you’re about to…
YabsUSETJXY,496160,497000,I cannot breathe.
YabsUSETJXY,501320,503520,That went all over my face.
YabsUSETJXY,503520,505360,Who gets the point?
YabsUSETJXY,505360,506199,Let’s think about it.
YabsUSETJXY,506200,509200,Carbonara that had cream in it and no eggs.
YabsUSETJXY,509200,510320,Ugh.
YabsUSETJXY,514880,518479,The fork goes to the left
YabsUSETJXY,518479,520959,"- Grazie, Prego. - It was very close."
YabsUSETJXY,520960,524920,"This one I believe, is a big step up from our last offering."
YabsUSETJXY,524920,525560,Okay.
YabsUSETJXY,525560,530600,It's Italian-inspired al taglio carbonara pizza.
YabsUSETJXY,530600,532440,"You know sometimes I go to Sainsbury,"
YabsUSETJXY,532440,534720,and I see stuff like that with nothing inside.
YabsUSETJXY,534720,537680,So people go take the pizzas and they put them in the jacket.
YabsUSETJXY,537680,538600,So you see empty boxes.
YabsUSETJXY,538600,541680,That's how good they are.
YabsUSETJXY,543360,544640,Again with a bit of basil.
YabsUSETJXY,544640,546320,He's not impressed by the basil.
YabsUSETJXY,546320,548880,So this does not look good.
YabsUSETJXY,548880,549800,"I mean, come on."
YabsUSETJXY,549800,550959,Let's be honest.
YabsUSETJXY,550960,552480,This is Italian style.
YabsUSETJXY,552480,553079,What is this?
YabsUSETJXY,553080,554440,This is separating. Look at this.
YabsUSETJXY,554440,556560,Is that not focaccia? Not normal?
YabsUSETJXY,556560,557920,I'll try it. I'll fold this up.
YabsUSETJXY,557920,559839,"Oh, fold. Is that Italian-style way of eating?"
YabsUSETJXY,559840,560520,Yep.
YabsUSETJXY,560520,561600,"Folding, okay."
YabsUSETJXY,561600,563519,"Um, oh my gosh."
YabsUSETJXY,564560,567400,- I had high hopes for this. - He does not want to win.
YabsUSETJXY,567400,569280,I had high hopes for this one.
YabsUSETJXY,569280,570160,What is this stuff?
YabsUSETJXY,570160,571000,Is that bacon?
YabsUSETJXY,571000,572880,I think that's bacon.
YabsUSETJXY,572880,574960,Oh my gosh. Try the bacon.
YabsUSETJXY,574960,577280,It's disgusting.
YabsUSETJXY,577280,580200,"To be honest, the carbonara pasta was better than this."
YabsUSETJXY,580200,582360,No!
YabsUSETJXY,582360,583880,I'm returning to pasta.
YabsUSETJXY,583880,586400,Sausage and ham tortellini.
YabsUSETJXY,586400,587240,Tortelloni.
YabsUSETJXY,587240,589040,Tortelloni.
YabsUSETJXY,593160,597600,"To be served alongside, arrabbiata."
YabsUSETJXY,597600,600199,"First thing, you see, arrabbiata doesn't say spicy arrabbiata."
YabsUSETJXY,600200,601120,So already it's a step up.
YabsUSETJXY,601120,603240,I mean it does say sweet and spicy underneath.
YabsUSETJXY,603240,605839,That's insane but anyway…
YabsUSETJXY,605840,608520,"Usually, you have tortellini which are like this."
YabsUSETJXY,608520,611240,And you have tortelloni which are like this.
YabsUSETJXY,611240,613880,So what the **** is this?
YabsUSETJXY,613880,616480,Oh my gosh.
YabsUSETJXY,616480,618120,It looks better.
YabsUSETJXY,618120,619200,Is that how you'd have?
YabsUSETJXY,619200,622400,"Of course not, no chance."
YabsUSETJXY,622400,625080,But the leaf looks nice here.
YabsUSETJXY,625080,626800,Finally!
YabsUSETJXY,639080,641120,Gosh.
YabsUSETJXY,641120,642880,I don't think I could eat all of that.
YabsUSETJXY,642880,644600,"Wow, the sauce is so strong."
YabsUSETJXY,644600,646360,It's so strong and salty.
YabsUSETJXY,646360,647519,The tortelloni itself.
YabsUSETJXY,647520,649160,The tortelloni is not bad.
YabsUSETJXY,649160,651519,Is it not bad?
YabsUSETJXY,651520,653440,It reminds me of my university days.
YabsUSETJXY,653440,654680,I've got fond memories of this.
YabsUSETJXY,654680,656040,"Actually, it's better without the sauce."
YabsUSETJXY,656040,658399,"The problem is, Ollie decided to serve it with the sauce."
YabsUSETJXY,658400,660520,"So we need to judge it with the sauce, not without the sauce."
YabsUSETJXY,660520,661520,Okay. That’s true.
YabsUSETJXY,661520,662120,"Yeah, we do."
YabsUSETJXY,662120,665279,"Before we compare, I have one final edition to end on."
YabsUSETJXY,665280,665920,What?
YabsUSETJXY,665920,670360,We can take an average of my final edition and the pizza.
YabsUSETJXY,670360,672720,"No, no, no."
YabsUSETJXY,672720,674839,Mr. Z agrees.
YabsUSETJXY,674840,678120,"If you're in the round of 3 in the Olympics, you're not like,"
YabsUSETJXY,678120,679640,I'm gonna throw the disc one more time.
YabsUSETJXY,679640,680520,Just see what you think.
YabsUSETJXY,680520,682280,I am the referee.
YabsUSETJXY,682280,685520,I allow it because his dish was so bad.
YabsUSETJXY,685520,687200,"Yeah, it’s true."
YabsUSETJXY,687200,688360,Let's be clear what this is then.
YabsUSETJXY,688360,689600,It's a sympathy round.
YabsUSETJXY,689600,691600,Correct.
YabsUSETJXY,691600,694360,So the next dish is being prepared as we speak.
YabsUSETJXY,694360,695920,I do have the packaging here though.
YabsUSETJXY,695920,699079,Just cook Italian-style meatballs.
YabsUSETJXY,699080,703200,"So first off, of course, Italians don't eat meatballs with pasta."
YabsUSETJXY,703200,704640,"Oh, that's a huge misstep."
YabsUSETJXY,704640,706720,"Oh dear, that's not gone well."
YabsUSETJXY,706720,710759,"We have meatballs, of course but it's like a main course."
YabsUSETJXY,710760,712320,Okay.
YabsUSETJXY,712320,713000,On their own?
YabsUSETJXY,713000,714000,Correct.
YabsUSETJXY,716240,717600,Look at that.
YabsUSETJXY,717600,718959,That’s insane.
YabsUSETJXY,718960,720520,Those are dead bodies floating.
YabsUSETJXY,720520,722920,Those are dead bodies floating?
YabsUSETJXY,722920,724720,"Josh, it looks like radioactive waste."
YabsUSETJXY,724720,725920,Okay.
YabsUSETJXY,725920,726839,Look how big it is.
YabsUSETJXY,726840,728040,The smell is not bad.
YabsUSETJXY,736560,738279,I cannot insult it too much.
YabsUSETJXY,738280,741760,"It's juicy, it's moist, it's not too dry."
YabsUSETJXY,741760,743480,"Flavour, it's a bit off."
YabsUSETJXY,743480,744720,The flavour's just not really there.
YabsUSETJXY,744720,746720,Like it doesn't really taste of much at all.
YabsUSETJXY,746720,750399,You know you said that Josh needs a win so I have something.
YabsUSETJXY,750400,751440,Olive oil.
YabsUSETJXY,751440,754760,"Oh, olive oil in the jacket."
YabsUSETJXY,754760,758440,"Okay, this is too much assistance."
YabsUSETJXY,758440,759640,I like it.
YabsUSETJXY,759640,761280,This is already a sympathy round.
YabsUSETJXY,761280,762960,Wow.
YabsUSETJXY,766800,768519,That is better.
YabsUSETJXY,768520,769480,Where is the pasta by the way?
YabsUSETJXY,769480,772040,I think we were deceived by the picture.
YabsUSETJXY,772040,773320,Because the picture had pasta in.
YabsUSETJXY,773320,776840,He gets an advantage because it's not pasta anymore.
YabsUSETJXY,776840,779480,...which is like the Italians eat it.
YabsUSETJXY,779480,782800,The actual sauce is ****. Try this sauce by itself.
YabsUSETJXY,784880,785880,"Ok, sauce is bad."
YabsUSETJXY,785880,786920,The sauce is not great.
YabsUSETJXY,786920,788079,It's not bad.
YabsUSETJXY,788080,791280,"According to Mr z, it's ****."
YabsUSETJXY,791280,793040,That's better than your tomato sauce.
YabsUSETJXY,793040,793720,That's definitely better.
YabsUSETJXY,793720,794360,Bring it back.
YabsUSETJXY,794360,795920,Which is more Italian?
YabsUSETJXY,795920,797000,You know the answer to that.
YabsUSETJXY,797000,798200,Do I? I don't know the answer to that.
YabsUSETJXY,799240,800800,Of course that.
YabsUSETJXY,800800,803640,"Man, this is insane."
YabsUSETJXY,803640,806360,What do you do with this?
YabsUSETJXY,806360,808560,Look at this.
YabsUSETJXY,808560,809440,Do you understand?
YabsUSETJXY,809440,810960,"You know at this stage, I just concede."
YabsUSETJXY,810960,812440,I concede my point.
YabsUSETJXY,812440,814560,"You can win that point, Ollie."
YabsUSETJXY,814560,817600,I have to give a fork to the left.
YabsUSETJXY,817600,819560,And we have a winner.
YabsUSETJXY,819560,820920,"Thank you, thank you."
YabsUSETJXY,820920,823399,Italians everywhere I want to thank you.
YabsUSETJXY,823400,826560,You put your trust in me and I delivered.
YabsUSETJXY,826560,828680,I delivered-
YabsUSETJXY,828680,832680,"Maybe next time, we’ll have to have you show us the best Italian food,"
YabsUSETJXY,832680,834560,That you can find in the UK.
YabsUSETJXY,834560,835560,Yes.
YabsUSETJXY,835560,836560,You up for that?
YabsUSETJXY,836560,837240,Are you up for that?
YabsUSETJXY,837240,838000,"Yeah, I'm up for it."
YabsUSETJXY,838000,839520,"In the meantime, guys."
YabsUSETJXY,839520,842120,- We'll see you jolly soon. - I need to move this.
