sXdfRYyzbmU,0,1920,but people are not objects on an
sXdfRYyzbmU,1920,3919,assembly line that's a ridiculous
sXdfRYyzbmU,3919,4840,notion
sXdfRYyzbmU,4840,7680,[Music]
sXdfRYyzbmU,7680,8880,what would you do if you had a free
sXdfRYyzbmU,8880,10880,reign over education
sXdfRYyzbmU,10880,13120,generally you want education to be like
sXdfRYyzbmU,13120,14240,as close to
sXdfRYyzbmU,14240,16240,a video game as possible like a good
sXdfRYyzbmU,16240,17520,video game like
sXdfRYyzbmU,17520,20320,you do not need to tell your kid to play
sXdfRYyzbmU,20320,21119,video games
sXdfRYyzbmU,21119,23039,they will play video games on autopilot
sXdfRYyzbmU,23039,24480,all day
sXdfRYyzbmU,24480,26880,so if you can make it interactive and
sXdfRYyzbmU,26880,28880,engaging
sXdfRYyzbmU,28880,32000,then then you can make education far
sXdfRYyzbmU,32000,33120,more compelling and
sXdfRYyzbmU,33120,36239,far easier to do so you really want to
sXdfRYyzbmU,36239,38480,um disconnect the whole grade level
sXdfRYyzbmU,38480,40000,three thing from
sXdfRYyzbmU,40000,42239,the subjects allow people to progress at
sXdfRYyzbmU,42239,44000,the fastest pace that they can
sXdfRYyzbmU,44000,48079,or are interested in in each subject
sXdfRYyzbmU,48239,51360,it seems like a really obvious thing um
sXdfRYyzbmU,51360,53440,i mean i think like most teaching today
sXdfRYyzbmU,53440,55520,is is a lot like vordeville
sXdfRYyzbmU,55520,59039,where um and it's and as a result just
sXdfRYyzbmU,59039,60719,not that compelling it's like somebody's
sXdfRYyzbmU,60719,62640,standing up there and lecturing to you
sXdfRYyzbmU,62640,63600,and they've done the same lecture
sXdfRYyzbmU,63600,64799,several years in a row they're not
sXdfRYyzbmU,64799,66320,necessarily all that engaged or
sXdfRYyzbmU,66320,68640,or in doing it do you agree with peter
sXdfRYyzbmU,68640,69439,thiel about
sXdfRYyzbmU,69439,72479,the unnecessariness of university higher
sXdfRYyzbmU,72479,73920,education
sXdfRYyzbmU,73920,75759,a university education is often
sXdfRYyzbmU,75759,78080,unnecessary
sXdfRYyzbmU,78080,80320,that's not to say it's unnecessary for
sXdfRYyzbmU,80320,82159,all people but
sXdfRYyzbmU,82159,85360,i think you probably learn about as much
sXdfRYyzbmU,85360,86720,or the vast majority what you're going
sXdfRYyzbmU,86720,89280,to learn there in the first two years
sXdfRYyzbmU,89280,91759,and most of it is from your classmates
sXdfRYyzbmU,91759,92479,now for
sXdfRYyzbmU,92479,95439,a lot of companies they they do want to
sXdfRYyzbmU,95439,96880,see the completion of the
sXdfRYyzbmU,96880,99759,degree because they're looking for
sXdfRYyzbmU,99759,101200,someone who's going to persevere
sXdfRYyzbmU,101200,103520,and see it through to the end and that's
sXdfRYyzbmU,103520,104240,actually
sXdfRYyzbmU,104240,106159,what what's important to them so it
sXdfRYyzbmU,106159,107680,really depends on what somebody's goal
sXdfRYyzbmU,107680,109920,is if the goal is to start a company
sXdfRYyzbmU,109920,112880,i would say no point in finishing
sXdfRYyzbmU,112880,115200,college
sXdfRYyzbmU,115200,117520,so i think that's how it should be and
sXdfRYyzbmU,117520,118880,it shouldn't be that you've got like
sXdfRYyzbmU,118880,120320,these grades where people move in
sXdfRYyzbmU,120320,121360,lockstep
sXdfRYyzbmU,121360,124320,um and so everyone goes through you know
sXdfRYyzbmU,124320,125920,goes like normally
sXdfRYyzbmU,125920,130000,you will go through english math uh
sXdfRYyzbmU,130000,131440,science and so forth from like fifth
sXdfRYyzbmU,131440,132800,grade to sixth grade to seventh grade
sXdfRYyzbmU,132800,134560,like it's an assembly line
sXdfRYyzbmU,134560,136959,but but people are not objects on an
sXdfRYyzbmU,136959,140640,assembly line that's a ridiculous
sXdfRYyzbmU,140840,143030,notion
