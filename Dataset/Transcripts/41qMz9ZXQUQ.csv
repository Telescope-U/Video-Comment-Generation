41qMz9ZXQUQ,12320,15200,hey it's me to those of you who visit me
41qMz9ZXQUQ,15200,17199,regularly here on my channel you may
41qMz9ZXQUQ,17199,18720,notice that i'm sitting somewhere
41qMz9ZXQUQ,18720,20480,different than i normally sit i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,20480,22480,sitting on a flower
41qMz9ZXQUQ,22480,24480,no i'm in a completely different space
41qMz9ZXQUQ,24480,26880,right now where am i i have some
41qMz9ZXQUQ,26880,32078,explaining to do i have a new studio
41qMz9ZXQUQ,32078,34640,oh my gosh this is beyond ridiculous by
41qMz9ZXQUQ,34640,36079,the way who likes my pink lighting in
41qMz9ZXQUQ,36079,38320,the background i quite like it i just
41qMz9ZXQUQ,38320,40719,moved into my current art room seven or
41qMz9ZXQUQ,40719,42239,eight months ago so i haven't been in
41qMz9ZXQUQ,42239,44239,there for that long and now i come to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,44239,48000,you saying i have a new studio
41qMz9ZXQUQ,48000,50320,so why in the world am i sitting here in
41qMz9ZXQUQ,50320,52719,a new studio with pink lighting a flower
41qMz9ZXQUQ,52719,55680,pillow a fluffy poof a plant that's not
41qMz9ZXQUQ,55680,58800,fred what is happening i am there is a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,58800,61920,whole story behind this i do want to say
41qMz9ZXQUQ,61920,64320,this video is not just a talky talky
41qMz9ZXQUQ,64320,65920,video i'm not going to be talkie-talking
41qMz9ZXQUQ,65920,68640,through the whole thing i have a massive
41qMz9ZXQUQ,68640,70159,art project that i'm going to be
41qMz9ZXQUQ,70159,72000,starting in this video there's going to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,72000,73920,be a lot of paint a lot of color it's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,73920,76240,going to be big but first i just need to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,76240,77920,talkie talkie a little bit now into the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,77920,82520,story flashback two years ago february
41qMz9ZXQUQ,82520,86400,2020. i was still in my old art room at
41qMz9ZXQUQ,86400,89360,this time filming videos loving it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,89360,91920,having a ball i had a deep affection for
41qMz9ZXQUQ,91920,94880,that art room but i had lights cameras
41qMz9ZXQUQ,94880,97200,sound panels all on tripods lots of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,97200,99680,cords crammed around me there wasn't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,99680,101680,much space to move around i wasn't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,101680,103360,personally too bothered by it because i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,103360,105280,was working in there alone doing smaller
41qMz9ZXQUQ,105280,107520,scale stuff but suddenly i started
41qMz9ZXQUQ,107520,109920,getting ideas for things where they
41qMz9ZXQUQ,109920,112000,weren't really possible in that room
41qMz9ZXQUQ,112000,113600,like for instance when i wanted to paint
41qMz9ZXQUQ,113600,115680,on these giant canvases i had to drag
41qMz9ZXQUQ,115680,117520,all my equipment and everything out to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,117520,119840,my dark cold garage which was fine it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,119840,121920,wasn't a big deal but you know obviously
41qMz9ZXQUQ,121920,124079,not ideal i also started getting really
41qMz9ZXQUQ,124079,126079,interested in the idea of doing collabs
41qMz9ZXQUQ,126079,128399,and bringing people into my videos but i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,128399,130160,knew it was just going to be too crammed
41qMz9ZXQUQ,130160,131840,so because of those reasons at that
41qMz9ZXQUQ,131840,133920,point two years ago i started looking
41qMz9ZXQUQ,133920,136160,for a studio space outside of my house
41qMz9ZXQUQ,136160,138720,that was a little bit more open and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,138720,140959,that's when i found this place that i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,140959,143760,sitting my booty in right now and it's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,143760,146800,actually on a farm a literal farm there
41qMz9ZXQUQ,146800,149280,are sheep right outside that window bang
41qMz9ZXQUQ,149280,150640,i don't know if they're buying i can't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,150640,152319,actually hear them now when we got this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,152319,154800,place it was not as you see it today
41qMz9ZXQUQ,154800,157040,there was no pink swivel chair and fuzzy
41qMz9ZXQUQ,157040,159519,ottomans and colorful paper rolls this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,159519,161840,place was um a little bit of a mess it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,161840,165040,was pretty neglected dirty it stank
41qMz9ZXQUQ,165040,168640,there was just stuff everywhere
41qMz9ZXQUQ,168640,170800,dirt and bugs and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,170800,173599,and this was actually a two level garage
41qMz9ZXQUQ,173599,176160,that was mostly unfinished the upstairs
41qMz9ZXQUQ,176160,178560,space which is now a lounge this is the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,178560,181360,before and this is the after a lot of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,181360,183280,work and where i'm sitting right now
41qMz9ZXQUQ,183280,185519,this is what it looked like before real
41qMz9ZXQUQ,185519,189120,not cute it took us days just to clear
41qMz9ZXQUQ,189120,192000,everything out
41qMz9ZXQUQ,195840,198560,that was an experience found some very
41qMz9ZXQUQ,198560,201020,interesting things
41qMz9ZXQUQ,201020,206869,[Music]
41qMz9ZXQUQ,208720,212120,i don't like
41qMz9ZXQUQ,212799,215360,what is it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,215440,218239,fun fact this was actually the workshop
41qMz9ZXQUQ,218239,221680,of a very avid train collector so there
41qMz9ZXQUQ,221680,225760,were like train parts and train sets
41qMz9ZXQUQ,225760,228799,everywhere many many train things i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,228799,230480,actually kept a couple of the trains
41qMz9ZXQUQ,230480,232319,just for sentimental purposes but but
41qMz9ZXQUQ,232319,234080,yeah we cleared everything out cleaned
41qMz9ZXQUQ,234080,236239,everything up and finally we were ready
41qMz9ZXQUQ,236239,238799,to start renovations about one month
41qMz9ZXQUQ,238799,243120,later boom march of 2020. what a magical
41qMz9ZXQUQ,243120,245519,wonderful time for the world it wasn't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,245519,248000,great timing we hit a lot of roadblocks
41qMz9ZXQUQ,248000,249920,when it came to the renovations and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,249920,252080,things took much much longer than
41qMz9ZXQUQ,252080,254480,anticipated so i've been working on this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,254480,256560,in the background for the past two years
41qMz9ZXQUQ,256560,258000,i didn't want to mention anything about
41qMz9ZXQUQ,258000,260079,this project on my channel because it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,260079,262560,makes me uneasy when people are waiting
41qMz9ZXQUQ,262560,264800,on something i feel like rush like oh my
41qMz9ZXQUQ,264800,266240,gosh they're waiting for it i need to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,266240,268000,hurry up so i'd rather just be like
41qMz9ZXQUQ,268000,269840,black surprise it's here and you didn't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,269840,271360,even know it was being worked on okay so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,271360,273280,like i said we got this place in 2020
41qMz9ZXQUQ,273280,276320,flash forward to the summer of 2021
41qMz9ZXQUQ,276320,278479,we end up getting a new house and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,278479,280880,deciding to move i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,280880,283120,moving
41qMz9ZXQUQ,283120,285199,and it just so happens that at our new
41qMz9ZXQUQ,285199,287280,house that we moved to there's this big
41qMz9ZXQUQ,287280,289680,open basement that works absolutely
41qMz9ZXQUQ,289680,292240,perfectly that ended up solving pretty
41qMz9ZXQUQ,292240,295040,much all of the issues that i had in my
41qMz9ZXQUQ,295040,297360,old art room so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,297360,300320,if i had known in 2020 that a year later
41qMz9ZXQUQ,300320,302240,we were gonna be moving to a house with
41qMz9ZXQUQ,302240,303840,a big open space that was gonna solve
41qMz9ZXQUQ,303840,306000,all my problems i probably wouldn't have
41qMz9ZXQUQ,306000,308880,gone out looking for a separate studio
41qMz9ZXQUQ,308880,311600,but that's just the way it happened but
41qMz9ZXQUQ,311600,313919,this is a great problem to have and i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,313919,316560,actually still super excited about this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,316560,319440,studio and this space is not going to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,319440,321360,waste we have been waiting and working
41qMz9ZXQUQ,321360,323440,on this thing for two years it's gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,323440,326000,get used there are just so many
41qMz9ZXQUQ,326000,328000,opportunities for different videos in
41qMz9ZXQUQ,328000,330800,this studio i have so many ideas because
41qMz9ZXQUQ,330800,331919,i've been thinking about it for two
41qMz9ZXQUQ,331919,334080,years and the first thing that i want to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,334080,339120,do is paint a giant mural
41qMz9ZXQUQ,339120,341039,i'm anxious excited about this i have a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,341039,343280,lot of nervous energy
41qMz9ZXQUQ,343280,344880,where i'm sitting right now is actually
41qMz9ZXQUQ,344880,347280,not the spot that i set up to film in
41qMz9ZXQUQ,347280,350000,for most videos i have right over here a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,350000,352160,space that i'm working on getting set up
41qMz9ZXQUQ,352160,354800,to film in it's got this huge rolling
41qMz9ZXQUQ,354800,357520,table for my work space that chair is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,357520,359440,where i'll be sitting clearly and the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,359440,362000,big white wall is what's gonna be in the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,362000,364319,background the white wall is not going
41qMz9ZXQUQ,364319,367360,to work for me okay it needs to go it is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,367360,370880,so white it is so empty it is nothing so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,370880,372880,that is where i would love to paint a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,372880,375440,nice big mural to be in the background
41qMz9ZXQUQ,375440,378080,of my videos i've never painted an area
41qMz9ZXQUQ,378080,380479,this big those massive canvases that i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,380479,382720,painted those would look tiny i'm a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,382720,385280,little bit scared that's a big big wall
41qMz9ZXQUQ,385280,388319,but i got this i can do this so i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,388319,390080,going to change into my painting clothes
41qMz9ZXQUQ,390080,392479,and i'm going to start planning for this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,392479,395199,massive project go to that all right so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,395199,397280,here i come why i always insist on
41qMz9ZXQUQ,397280,399120,entering like that is beyond me just
41qMz9ZXQUQ,399120,401280,stop please before i actually start
41qMz9ZXQUQ,401280,402720,painting i'm just gonna go ahead and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,402720,404560,make myself comfortable i've got out the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,404560,407199,good old ipad let me check out the space
41qMz9ZXQUQ,407199,409919,what do i have to work with here oh
41qMz9ZXQUQ,409919,412560,white okay white it's white big white
41qMz9ZXQUQ,412560,414400,got it so i went ahead and quickly
41qMz9ZXQUQ,414400,416560,started working out what i wanted to do
41qMz9ZXQUQ,416560,419039,this mural has been on my mind for a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,419039,421199,long while but i hadn't really sat down
41qMz9ZXQUQ,421199,423280,and worked it out quite yet so i drew
41qMz9ZXQUQ,423280,425039,out the room and then started going
41qMz9ZXQUQ,425039,427440,crazy with my design which clearly
41qMz9ZXQUQ,427440,429759,involves a lot of rainbow because i love
41qMz9ZXQUQ,429759,431440,them all i also tried to think about
41qMz9ZXQUQ,431440,434160,where the table was gonna be and a very
41qMz9ZXQUQ,434160,436880,rough idea of what part of the mural
41qMz9ZXQUQ,436880,438880,would be in the frame of the camera
41qMz9ZXQUQ,438880,441680,that's so wonky i i can't me no likey
41qMz9ZXQUQ,441680,443759,straight lines and measurements can you
41qMz9ZXQUQ,443759,446000,tell so this is not precise but i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,446000,448080,honestly just did not care this was for
41qMz9ZXQUQ,448080,450560,my purposes so i could visualize my idea
41qMz9ZXQUQ,450560,452479,really quickly this is what i came up
41qMz9ZXQUQ,452479,456000,with so neat and not chaotic at all
41qMz9ZXQUQ,456000,458080,my mural may or may not end up looking
41qMz9ZXQUQ,458080,459919,like this either way i'm satisfied with
41qMz9ZXQUQ,459919,463680,this sketch so um i guess it's time to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,463680,466000,actually go over there and uh get
41qMz9ZXQUQ,466000,468080,started i'm i'm so scared standing up
41qMz9ZXQUQ,468080,470720,now boom here i am in the space this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,470720,473120,wall is massive how am i even gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,473120,474960,paint all the way up there oh boy well
41qMz9ZXQUQ,474960,477199,let's get this out of here okay yeah
41qMz9ZXQUQ,477199,479280,getting started after this i just need
41qMz9ZXQUQ,479280,481360,to process really quick maybe a good
41qMz9ZXQUQ,481360,484080,stretch okay now doing ballet right
41qMz9ZXQUQ,484080,486400,don't even know what that is so what's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,486400,488160,what's happening here let me diagnose
41qMz9ZXQUQ,488160,490160,this situation this is definitely the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,490160,492080,biggest project that i've ever done so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,492080,494800,this is just all the anticipation and me
41qMz9ZXQUQ,494800,496960,just being very overwhelmed that's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,496960,499280,apparent but i am going to get started
41qMz9ZXQUQ,499280,501360,first i need to move this massive table
41qMz9ZXQUQ,501360,503759,out of here luckily it is on wheels so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,503759,505360,it's easy
41qMz9ZXQUQ,505360,507759,er then if it weren't on wheels get that
41qMz9ZXQUQ,507759,509280,out of here but then i thought wait
41qMz9ZXQUQ,509280,511199,shouldn't i be using the table to kind
41qMz9ZXQUQ,511199,513680,of plan out where the art is going to go
41qMz9ZXQUQ,513680,515680,moving it back i want to know about how
41qMz9ZXQUQ,515680,517760,much of the wall you can see in the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,517760,519760,frame so i set everything up how it's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,519760,521760,going to be when i'm filming here and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,521760,525040,using some tape i'm marking the area out
41qMz9ZXQUQ,525040,528160,roughly that looks rough whatever now
41qMz9ZXQUQ,528160,530640,again moving everything out there these
41qMz9ZXQUQ,530640,532560,are old pants and they're falling down
41qMz9ZXQUQ,532560,536080,better eat more oreos and coffee wow i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,536080,538320,really serious about nutrition i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,538320,540080,actually don't often eat things like
41qMz9ZXQUQ,540080,542560,oreos but i was stressed okay and oh
41qMz9ZXQUQ,542560,545360,look at that finally i have an art tool
41qMz9ZXQUQ,545360,548000,in my hand it's a pencil and i'm way too
41qMz9ZXQUQ,548000,550480,proud of that taking my wonderful sketch
41qMz9ZXQUQ,550480,552399,i'm gonna start transferring my design
41qMz9ZXQUQ,552399,553920,onto the wall and of course i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,553920,555680,immediately discovered that my drawing
41qMz9ZXQUQ,555680,557839,was completely out of proportion but
41qMz9ZXQUQ,557839,559680,that's fine i'm figuring it out you
41qMz9ZXQUQ,559680,561680,can't really see what i'm doing at all
41qMz9ZXQUQ,561680,565839,but i assure you you're not missing much
41qMz9ZXQUQ,566480,568160,stop does that sound like something
41qMz9ZXQUQ,568160,570480,beautiful is being created no in fact
41qMz9ZXQUQ,570480,572560,here it is wow that's a that ought to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,572560,574640,give you faith in my art skills i bought
41qMz9ZXQUQ,574640,576720,all of these to hold my custom mix
41qMz9ZXQUQ,576720,578959,colors just for this mural and of course
41qMz9ZXQUQ,578959,581600,a ton of regular acrylic paint and here
41qMz9ZXQUQ,581600,584640,we go starting with red it's blood
41qMz9ZXQUQ,584640,586720,no no it's not why did i do that adding
41qMz9ZXQUQ,586720,588880,a ton of pink and a bunch of white to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,588880,590560,lighten it up there we go that's my
41qMz9ZXQUQ,590560,592959,custom red and i have to mix up the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,592959,595760,whole rainbow of colors both a light and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,595760,598080,a dark version of each color moving down
41qMz9ZXQUQ,598080,600160,the rainbow we're at yellow now i added
41qMz9ZXQUQ,600160,601920,a bunch of this to my paint mixture as
41qMz9ZXQUQ,601920,603760,well i want to make sure that it has a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,603760,606720,completely matte finish because glossy
41qMz9ZXQUQ,606720,608880,can be so annoying to work with when
41qMz9ZXQUQ,608880,610640,you're filming it's the worst thing ever
41qMz9ZXQUQ,610640,612480,also it does help the paint go a little
41qMz9ZXQUQ,612480,614720,bit further yellow's done looking
41qMz9ZXQUQ,614720,616640,luscious yummy
41qMz9ZXQUQ,616640,618959,that's not yummy this was actually a ton
41qMz9ZXQUQ,618959,621519,of paint to mix on camera these don't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,621519,622880,look like they're that large of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,622880,626079,containers but they really are okay okay
41qMz9ZXQUQ,626079,628240,i think i was mixing paint for a full
41qMz9ZXQUQ,628240,630560,hour before i finally got the full
41qMz9ZXQUQ,630560,632959,rainbow of colors in a pastel and a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,632959,635360,slightly darker version of each 12
41qMz9ZXQUQ,635360,637519,colors in total if you couldn't do that
41qMz9ZXQUQ,637519,640079,math thank you and i was so ready to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,640079,641920,start painting at this point i just kind
41qMz9ZXQUQ,641920,644399,of jumped into it without ceremony all
41qMz9ZXQUQ,644399,646959,that buildup and then that's how i start
41qMz9ZXQUQ,646959,649440,like that but finally i am painting i've
41qMz9ZXQUQ,649440,651360,already dropped paint on the fresh new
41qMz9ZXQUQ,651360,653839,floors don't even bother it's it's just
41qMz9ZXQUQ,653839,655600,it's gonna happen you're wasting your
41qMz9ZXQUQ,655600,657360,time right now all right here we go
41qMz9ZXQUQ,657360,659360,we're moving now i'm starting with this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,659360,662000,one massive rainbow that swoops across
41qMz9ZXQUQ,662000,664320,the entire wall it's this one in the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,664320,666399,sketch and i was really just roughing it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,666399,669200,in not too worried about neatness i was
41qMz9ZXQUQ,669200,671120,just gonna get the color on the wall and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,671120,672800,then i'll go back and fix up everything
41qMz9ZXQUQ,672800,674720,and oh starting on the major
41qMz9ZXQUQ,674720,676959,intersection i want this point to be
41qMz9ZXQUQ,676959,679360,right behind me when i'm filming so i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,679360,681760,kind of starting with the main focal
41qMz9ZXQUQ,681760,683920,point and then i'll just work my way out
41qMz9ZXQUQ,683920,685920,from there and actually at this point i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,685920,687600,was really enjoying this there was
41qMz9ZXQUQ,687600,689839,something kind of freeing about painting
41qMz9ZXQUQ,689839,692640,these huge areas of color that just keep
41qMz9ZXQUQ,692640,694959,on going and keep on going but then uh
41qMz9ZXQUQ,694959,696959,oh guess what i've already screwed up
41qMz9ZXQUQ,696959,699440,the critical intersection is actually
41qMz9ZXQUQ,699440,701920,made up of two pastel rainbows what i've
41qMz9ZXQUQ,701920,704640,done here is one pastel rainbow and one
41qMz9ZXQUQ,704640,707600,bright rainbow oh no this is tragic also
41qMz9ZXQUQ,707600,709440,that paint was still wet
41qMz9ZXQUQ,709440,711120,so i'm gonna go over this again and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,711120,713680,switch to pastel colors because that is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,713680,716639,important yeah yeah no problem sure go
41qMz9ZXQUQ,716639,718560,ahead and redo that whole section there
41qMz9ZXQUQ,718560,721600,you got all the time in the world friend
41qMz9ZXQUQ,721600,724399,actually i only allocated three days of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,724399,726480,time in my schedule to finish this
41qMz9ZXQUQ,726480,729200,entire mural so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,729200,731519,chop chop here i go touching up some of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,731519,733760,that back rainbow a little bit and just
41qMz9ZXQUQ,733760,736079,like that wow this was actually the end
41qMz9ZXQUQ,736079,738720,of day one this is as far as i was able
41qMz9ZXQUQ,738720,741600,to get in an entire day of painting i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,741600,743440,think i underestimated how long this is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,743440,745680,gonna take because this is not even
41qMz9ZXQUQ,745680,749279,close to a third of the way done but
41qMz9ZXQUQ,749279,751760,boom i'm back this is my face the very
41qMz9ZXQUQ,751760,754240,next day adorable i'm in the same
41qMz9ZXQUQ,754240,756639,clothes different undershirt though also
41qMz9ZXQUQ,756639,758800,i did wash these clothes but they are
41qMz9ZXQUQ,758800,760959,officially paint stained that's fine so
41qMz9ZXQUQ,760959,763279,was 60 of my wardrobe but i'm ready to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,763279,765040,start the day and hoping to make a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,765040,767200,little bit more progress than yesterday
41qMz9ZXQUQ,767200,768800,and this is the face of someone who is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,768800,770320,questioning their ability to complete
41qMz9ZXQUQ,770320,771920,that task and this is the face of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,771920,773760,someone who is in denial and trying to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,773760,776079,exude confidence the reality is there is
41qMz9ZXQUQ,776079,778160,a lot left to do i was sadly
41qMz9ZXQUQ,778160,779920,disappointed by the pitiful amount of
41qMz9ZXQUQ,779920,782399,progress that i had made however i am
41qMz9ZXQUQ,782399,784399,enjoying the colors can you tell they're
41qMz9ZXQUQ,784399,786399,my favorite they're like the exact same
41qMz9ZXQUQ,786399,788480,colors as my nails back to painting
41qMz9ZXQUQ,788480,790399,starting on the ground today where i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,790399,792880,noticed the presence of an unwelcome
41qMz9ZXQUQ,792880,795279,guest there's an outlet in my mural i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,795279,797279,just gonna get rid of that for now and
41qMz9ZXQUQ,797279,798639,i'll deal with that later now i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,798639,800000,mentioned that i've been thinking about
41qMz9ZXQUQ,800000,802320,this mural for a long time i've put a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,802320,805040,lot of thought into what would be cool
41qMz9ZXQUQ,805040,807200,and important enough to use as a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,807200,809360,background for my videos this is a lot
41qMz9ZXQUQ,809360,811440,of pressure this is going to be seen
41qMz9ZXQUQ,811440,813600,over and over and over and i'm gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,813600,815680,have to look at it and you are gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,815680,817839,have to look at it assuming you're gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,817839,819680,watch my videos in the future am i gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,819680,821519,like it are you gonna hate it i don't
41qMz9ZXQUQ,821519,823519,know i'm scared i'm a little freaking
41qMz9ZXQUQ,823519,825040,out i thought about painting my
41qMz9ZXQUQ,825040,827279,characters but i already have my whole
41qMz9ZXQUQ,827279,829199,squishy shelf background and that's got
41qMz9ZXQUQ,829199,831760,tons of my characters on it already so i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,831760,833360,wanted to do something very different
41qMz9ZXQUQ,833360,835600,with a whole new vibe that's really what
41qMz9ZXQUQ,835600,837519,i'm trying to paint here not an image
41qMz9ZXQUQ,837519,839680,but a vibe anyone ask me what i'm
41qMz9ZXQUQ,839680,841680,painting i'm painting a vibe i want it
41qMz9ZXQUQ,841680,844320,to be bright colorful and clean and i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,844320,845680,definitely knew that this was not the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,845680,847680,time to try something like totally
41qMz9ZXQUQ,847680,849760,uncharacteristic of me this is going to
41qMz9ZXQUQ,849760,851760,be in a lot of my videos and so i wanted
41qMz9ZXQUQ,851760,854480,to feel like typical me also you may be
41qMz9ZXQUQ,854480,857199,wondering girl why are you painting all
41qMz9ZXQUQ,857199,859040,the way over there you're not even gonna
41qMz9ZXQUQ,859040,860800,be able to see that on camera yes i
41qMz9ZXQUQ,860800,863040,could have just painted a rectangular
41qMz9ZXQUQ,863040,864800,painting that fits right within the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,864800,867040,frame of the camera and that's actually
41qMz9ZXQUQ,867040,870000,what i was going to do at first but then
41qMz9ZXQUQ,870000,872880,i realized if i ever want to turn the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,872880,874720,camera and get different angles you're
41qMz9ZXQUQ,874720,876880,gonna see this very ugly edge where the
41qMz9ZXQUQ,876880,879519,mural stops so you know what that's fine
41qMz9ZXQUQ,879519,880880,we'll just take this all the way go
41qMz9ZXQUQ,880880,882880,floor to ceiling no big deal and now
41qMz9ZXQUQ,882880,886079,here i am 16 hours in and look who's
41qMz9ZXQUQ,886079,888399,suffering for it oh oh gosh that
41qMz9ZXQUQ,888399,891199,ponytail that is looking rough and hi
41qMz9ZXQUQ,891199,895040,this is me end of day too
41qMz9ZXQUQ,896720,898079,whatever that means i don't know what
41qMz9ZXQUQ,898079,899920,that was like some sort of siren let me
41qMz9ZXQUQ,899920,903040,tell you i was hurting i felt back pain
41qMz9ZXQUQ,903040,905120,like no other but this is what i was
41qMz9ZXQUQ,905120,907760,able to accomplish on day two i got a
41qMz9ZXQUQ,907760,910480,lot further than i did on day one but i
