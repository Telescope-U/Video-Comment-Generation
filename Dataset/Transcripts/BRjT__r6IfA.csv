BRjT__r6IfA,300,6480,[Music]  there's a saying that what you water is
BRjT__r6IfA,6480,11599,ultimately what grows  that where you place your attention
BRjT__r6IfA,11599,16800,ends up guiding your feelings your  perception your actions and your life
BRjT__r6IfA,16800,23039,right focus becomes identity  and change comes from bringing awareness
BRjT__r6IfA,23039,28800,to what we're focusing on  i remember when this light bulb went off  for me
BRjT__r6IfA,28800,34559,like so many epiphanies you know what  happened during a difficult kind of a  trying time it wasn't where i wanted to
BRjT__r6IfA,34559,41200,be and i remember you know sitting down  and asking myself  you know dude are you on your own team  here are you helping yourself
BRjT__r6IfA,41200,48559,[Music]  using the metaphor the question was am i  watering the weeds in my life or the
BRjT__r6IfA,48559,53920,flowers  and by the weeds i mean am i allocating
BRjT__r6IfA,53920,58960,energy to thoughts that are detrimental  to what i want
BRjT__r6IfA,58960,64640,am i keeping myself in places i don't  want to be and in relationships that are  counterproductive am i thinking about
BRjT__r6IfA,64640,69280,what can go wrong instead of all that  can go right
BRjT__r6IfA,70960,76799,or am i watering the flowers the  positive highlighting the possibility  the things i'm appreciative for the
BRjT__r6IfA,76799,83520,seeds the potential that can grow a mile  high  see i've always known the value in
BRjT__r6IfA,83520,92159,choosing to see the possibility  but the million dollar question is how  do you remain aware
BRjT__r6IfA,92159,100240,because that's the thing about weeds  they're sneaky they'll take control of  your life without letting you know  they're doing it
BRjT__r6IfA,100240,105520,so i'm thinking this through and it  dawns on me this is not complex
BRjT__r6IfA,105520,112880,this is simple  it's one identifying where you want to  be and two analyzing your actions
BRjT__r6IfA,112880,119759,based on those priorities right that's  it and so for every pillar of my life  health relationships career finances
BRjT__r6IfA,119759,126479,i made two dots  one for where i am  and one for where i want to be
BRjT__r6IfA,126479,132080,everything in the middle is life the ups  the downs the joys the sorrow
BRjT__r6IfA,132080,139760,everything in between is the path the  line  [Music]  and it's simple you start on point a
BRjT__r6IfA,139760,144879,knowing that you can always get to point  b
BRjT__r6IfA,144879,151519,that what you want exists it's there  it's available  and your attention all of your energy
BRjT__r6IfA,151519,157760,should be allocated to the thoughts that  reinforce that truth that's your path  that's what you believe that's what's
BRjT__r6IfA,157760,163280,important and it's going to happen  anything beyond or outside that line
BRjT__r6IfA,163280,169680,anything that tells you you're not good  enough anything that accepts not  achieving that priority suggests it
BRjT__r6IfA,169680,175920,won't work out that is where the weeds  live that is wasted space why exhaust
BRjT__r6IfA,175920,181760,that energy  [Music]  right to think you know i'm not good
BRjT__r6IfA,181760,188879,enough to get this promotion how does  that help you get to your point b  it doesn't eliminate that thought right
BRjT__r6IfA,188879,194239,point b always exists  just that notion pushes a lot of things
BRjT__r6IfA,194239,199360,to the side you have to be good enough  you just need improvement maybe it's
BRjT__r6IfA,199360,206480,enhanced skills maybe it's more effort  maybe it's changed approach but tackling  these things will water the flowers it
BRjT__r6IfA,206480,211680,moves you along the path and progress is  happiness
BRjT__r6IfA,211760,217760,i for me uh health is a big thing i run  all the time but i'd like to be more fit  i'd like to eat healthier there's room
BRjT__r6IfA,217760,223920,for improvement and i know it's possible  because that is my point b
BRjT__r6IfA,223920,229840,i know that saying i don't have time or  i don't have the right body type or  genes or trying to convince myself that
BRjT__r6IfA,229840,237760,fast food just this once will be okay no  all of that stuff is watering weeds it  exists outside my path
BRjT__r6IfA,237760,243680,my time should be spent realizing how  incredible the human body is taking care  of it pushing it being proud of it
BRjT__r6IfA,243680,249599,taking accountability for it  that's me i only get one of these things  even if it's just a little at a time
BRjT__r6IfA,249599,256720,that's the beauty simply existing on a  path and revolving around your ideals  your vision your priorities brings about
BRjT__r6IfA,256720,262240,joy  [Music]  negativity it truly is a learned thing
BRjT__r6IfA,262240,268080,it's manufactured  all there are in life are circumstances  circumstances that are neither positive
BRjT__r6IfA,268080,276080,nor negative just pieces and you decide  what to do with them  do you focus on the negative you can
BRjT__r6IfA,276080,281520,but that won't put you in a position to  change your circumstances or bring about  happiness
BRjT__r6IfA,281520,287680,when you decide to see the opportunity  you free yourself from the shackles of  fate because destiny never put you in
BRjT__r6IfA,287680,293759,the situation you did but guess what you  can take yourself out of it  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,293759,299680,a field of sunflowers grew one root one  stem one petal at a time the same fuel
BRjT__r6IfA,299680,306470,that was at one point nothing more than  dirt and weeds it was always possible  and so is your ideal life
BRjT__r6IfA,306470,312890,[Music]  you just need to water the things that  matter
BRjT__r6IfA,312890,316019,[Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,329520,334960,i saw an interview by one of my favorite  authors today steven pressfield
BRjT__r6IfA,334960,340960,where he highlighted what i believe to  be a critical and often overlooked point
BRjT__r6IfA,341039,347520,he says a lot of people think life is  short but life is actually long
BRjT__r6IfA,347520,353600,he goes on to explain that he didn't  even get his first book published until  well into his adult life making the
BRjT__r6IfA,353600,359039,point  that people at 24 34 54 64 they think
BRjT__r6IfA,359039,364240,they've won or lost  and they've got a lot of game left to
BRjT__r6IfA,364240,370080,play  and this message it does a few things i
BRjT__r6IfA,370080,375440,think first and most obviously it  creates a kind of calm
BRjT__r6IfA,375440,382000,like okay i can take some of the  pressure off myself life isn't a sprint  it's a marathon i'm not doing so bad
BRjT__r6IfA,382000,388880,sometimes we lose that perspective  we forget that the best things in life  evolve over time
BRjT__r6IfA,388880,395120,often not an avalanche but the chipping  away of a stone until the statue
BRjT__r6IfA,395120,403120,reveals itself  as frustrating as it may be clarity is  often an evolution
BRjT__r6IfA,404160,410000,and the second thing is  it plays a role in defining what success
BRjT__r6IfA,410000,417039,means  if games are won in the second half  as they frequently are
BRjT__r6IfA,417039,423599,then we learn not to define ourselves by  the outcome of the first quarter  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,423599,430560,but more importantly to put ourselves in  position to win in the fourth  the score at half time is not defining
BRjT__r6IfA,430560,435919,it's  a treasure trove of lessons and  information and data that can be tapped
BRjT__r6IfA,435919,441440,into to get the result  that we ultimately want
BRjT__r6IfA,441440,447599,and i often think of  running in south florida where you know  i i joke that i don't sit at the beach
BRjT__r6IfA,447599,454720,but if you run during the day  you know you kind of get the best of  both worlds a little bit of sunshine you  get your workout in uh but the obvious
BRjT__r6IfA,454720,460319,disadvantage  especially in the summer is that the  heat is taxing on the body it's more
BRjT__r6IfA,460319,466560,challenging to run uh under that sun and  what i find is
BRjT__r6IfA,466639,472560,that when i push my pace right out of  the gate  right from the start push my physical
BRjT__r6IfA,472560,478479,boundaries the second half of the run is  a nightmare  always i'm dragging
BRjT__r6IfA,478479,484000,you know speed isn't even a factor i'm  pleading with myself to simply not stop
BRjT__r6IfA,484000,490000,because i haven't positioned myself well  but on the other hand
BRjT__r6IfA,490000,497039,when i'm disciplined  and when from the start i ease into  something comfortable and progressively
BRjT__r6IfA,497039,504160,increase my speed  my body somehow responds exponentially  better i get the most out of myself that
BRjT__r6IfA,504160,511599,way  that's why i've said in the past i'm  proudest of my results when the last few  miles are the fastest miles
BRjT__r6IfA,511599,517200,it means i have the discipline in the  foresight to make that happen
BRjT__r6IfA,517279,523518,and ultimately the big picture is  affected in a positive way  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,523518,529120,and i know the same can be said for  other aspects of life  i know the same can be said for the
BRjT__r6IfA,529120,534160,moments of temptation  when my ego pleads with me to do what
BRjT__r6IfA,534160,540640,someone else is doing  or things aren't evolving as quickly as  i want so my pride says just walk away
BRjT__r6IfA,540640,546640,from it all  why because the current moment doesn't  look how i wanted it to
BRjT__r6IfA,546640,551760,so the mind says panic it says change  things it says you're losing or not good  enough
BRjT__r6IfA,551760,557760,it says you better pick up the pace  right now because you're losing this  current moment
BRjT__r6IfA,558399,564480,but no the question isn't  is right now the goal
BRjT__r6IfA,564720,570160,the question is  is right now moving me forward
BRjT__r6IfA,570160,576080,consistently  so that when the time comes to sprint so
BRjT__r6IfA,576080,581360,that when i'm ready to go faster than  i've ever gone be more than i've ever  been
BRjT__r6IfA,581360,586640,i've positioned myself to do just that  when things were challenging i kept
BRjT__r6IfA,586640,593600,moving forward when the world around me  seemed to be moving at a faster pace  i ran my own race i stayed consistent i
BRjT__r6IfA,593600,600160,remembered what mattered to me  that's the question
BRjT__r6IfA,600720,607040,and by the way this doesn't mean  ignoring today's results  means asking yourself whether today's
BRjT__r6IfA,607040,612480,results are meaningful in the big  picture  right using steven pressfield's example
BRjT__r6IfA,612480,619040,if you don't get published or your work  is rejected again and again and again  you have not lost
BRjT__r6IfA,619040,626399,it's the beginning it's the first  quarter  but what info can you gain from this
BRjT__r6IfA,626399,633600,what tweaks can you make to your work so  that it's in some way more captivating  how can you sell it a little better what
BRjT__r6IfA,633600,640240,can you do to connect with people who  will believe in you and help push you  forward
BRjT__r6IfA,640240,646399,remember you only lose  when you decide to stop
BRjT__r6IfA,646399,653360,why because as long as you're willing to  adjust and keep going there are no  stopping points
BRjT__r6IfA,653360,659200,people don't realize limitations are  self-imposed losing or quitting just  means you stood up
BRjT__r6IfA,659200,667440,and said i'm going to stop learning and  evolving with regard to this pursuit i  no longer want to adapt and move on
BRjT__r6IfA,667519,672640,no outside circumstances can impose that  a punk
BRjT__r6IfA,672640,677839,it's truly an internal decision  i remember jim rohn saying success is
BRjT__r6IfA,677839,686959,easy doing the thing that's best for you  in the long run is easy  doing the right things every day is easy
BRjT__r6IfA,686959,692880,and people would say well  that doesn't make sense why isn't  everyone successful
BRjT__r6IfA,692880,698640,well because  doing the wrong thing is easy too  it's easy to think right now is the
BRjT__r6IfA,698640,704000,end-all be-all  to forget the big picture that life is a  journey that you are equipped with
BRjT__r6IfA,704000,709440,everything you need  and when you don't see success to your  left or right when your ideal world
BRjT__r6IfA,709440,714959,hasn't been created to panic  to seek drastic change instead of
BRjT__r6IfA,714959,722240,remembering one step in front of the  other gets you to your finish line  instead of remembering the second half
BRjT__r6IfA,722240,728480,is where you make your move is where you  make your push  not every swing is a home run
BRjT__r6IfA,728480,734720,not every swing needs to be a home run  it's about on base percentage it's about
BRjT__r6IfA,734720,743440,setting yourself up for success  step by step  day by day allowing yourself to evolve
BRjT__r6IfA,743440,750000,because if you hang in there long enough  if you say yes and trust yourself long  enough you will get your super bowl you
BRjT__r6IfA,750000,757600,will get your midday run when the sun is  at its fullest you're exhausted you're  tired and you don't want to keep going
BRjT__r6IfA,757600,765360,but because you invested in the big  picture because you played the long game  you'll be one of the few who understands
BRjT__r6IfA,765360,770800,who has created the weapon the answer  the key that will open the door
BRjT__r6IfA,770800,778240,very few people get to open and walk  through  the best things in life take time
BRjT__r6IfA,778240,784399,and time requires patience patience can  be painful
BRjT__r6IfA,784399,792320,it can cause  suffering  chaos  but from that chaos comes order from
BRjT__r6IfA,792320,797440,that suffering comes meaning everything  we needed and wanted is on the other
BRjT__r6IfA,797440,804399,side of that  evolution see that your short-term  losses are not crippling you
BRjT__r6IfA,804399,816090,they are  creating  you  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,827519,833199,there's a story about some frogs  and uh  you know these frogs as they're sort of
BRjT__r6IfA,833199,840000,making their way through the woods  the ground breaks underneath them and  two of them fall into this little pit
BRjT__r6IfA,840000,846079,way way way down they tumble and  eventually they hit  the bottom they're looking up and
BRjT__r6IfA,846079,852560,they're realizing how far they've fallen  right moving around panicking  essentially coming to grips with the
BRjT__r6IfA,852560,860079,situation that they're now in  they start frantically jumping trying to  to climb the walls
BRjT__r6IfA,860079,866000,and as they're jumping  the frogs on top are looking down  and
BRjT__r6IfA,866000,872399,they're basically yelling look we're  sorry this happened to you but this is a  lost cause there's no way out for you
BRjT__r6IfA,872399,878880,guys there's no need to jump around this  is a futile situation  right but they continue to jump and
BRjT__r6IfA,878880,884399,they're jumped not willing to come to  terms with that possibility not yet  and again
BRjT__r6IfA,884399,889920,the frogs up top they yell down  you know there's no way
BRjT__r6IfA,889920,895839,it's over you're going to die down there  guys you need to ultimately face that
BRjT__r6IfA,895839,903519,and one of the two frogs in the pit does  concede to the situation he hears the  voices and you know he stops jumping and
BRjT__r6IfA,903519,909360,makes his way further down the pit and  he dies  but the second one the second one keeps
BRjT__r6IfA,909360,915279,jumping and jumping and adjusting his  approach  trying different things
BRjT__r6IfA,915279,922160,ultimately he does get out he climbs  over the ledge and when he gets to the  top he's confronted by the others
BRjT__r6IfA,922160,927600,and they they come up to him they ask  him hey didn't you hear us yelling down  that the situation was impossible didn't
BRjT__r6IfA,927600,932959,you hear us say there was no way out  and as it turns out he didn't hear
BRjT__r6IfA,932959,938000,because this frog was deaf right so he  couldn't hear a single word
BRjT__r6IfA,938000,945360,and this ultimately saved his life  [Music]  not because it helped him do the  miraculous or the impossible
BRjT__r6IfA,945360,954240,but because it blocked out the outside  voices  attempting to tell him what possible
BRjT__r6IfA,955839,961199,look there will always be doubters  skeptics and cynics as aristotle said
BRjT__r6IfA,961199,968560,there is one way to avoid criticism  do nothing say nothing and be nothing
BRjT__r6IfA,968560,974720,but the beauty is that these voices have  one thing in common and that's their  irrelevance
BRjT__r6IfA,974720,980839,because there's one voice that matters  in the writing of your story and that  voice belongs to
BRjT__r6IfA,980839,988880,you  never forget how much control you have  never forget who holds the pen
BRjT__r6IfA,988880,996639,things are real when you make them real  things stop when you stop things change  when you change them so here's the
BRjT__r6IfA,996639,1002160,following not orders or expectations  but that spark that guides you to what
BRjT__r6IfA,1002160,1009639,feels right so what means the most  here's to an everlasting self-belief
BRjT__r6IfA,1010079,1017199,will lift you out  of any hole  carry you over any mountain
BRjT__r6IfA,1017199,1027240,and most importantly turn blank pages  into a story that is truly yours
BRjT__r6IfA,1046558,1053159,when the water rises  it sink or swim
BRjT__r6IfA,1054160,1061120,we pick up certain truths as we make our  way through life  realizations little awakenings
BRjT__r6IfA,1061120,1066720,patterns  that allow us to map the things around  us so that we can navigate
BRjT__r6IfA,1066720,1072559,this crazy place  and here's one such realization
BRjT__r6IfA,1072559,1078000,for my own journey  when you pursue your best
BRjT__r6IfA,1078000,1084080,you live your best life  your best is a north star to guide you a
BRjT__r6IfA,1084080,1091039,bar line or benchmark that's always  moving a reminder that you can always do  more and be more
BRjT__r6IfA,1091039,1098480,a reminder that life tomorrow  can always be different than life today
BRjT__r6IfA,1100240,1105600,to pursue your best in my opinion is  synonymous with capturing all that is
BRjT__r6IfA,1105600,1111760,good in this world  capitalizing on potential
BRjT__r6IfA,1111760,1119440,is to utilize those resources in need of  an architect  that pen in need of a poet brush in need
BRjT__r6IfA,1119440,1126160,of a painter's story in need of a writer  or populist in need of a leader
BRjT__r6IfA,1126559,1132480,it's a pursuit that not only supplements  our existence here on earth
BRjT__r6IfA,1132480,1138880,now i believe it is in and of itself why  we are here on earth
BRjT__r6IfA,1139120,1144720,but like every ideal pragmatism seems to  get in the way
BRjT__r6IfA,1144720,1150960,meaning  well life is more difficult in execution  than it looks on paper
BRjT__r6IfA,1150960,1156400,we can't be our quote unquote best every  day we sometimes fall short of that mark
BRjT__r6IfA,1156400,1161200,our outcomes don't always align with our  expectations
BRjT__r6IfA,1161520,1167360,the perpetual journey to one's best is  neither straight nor without discomfort
BRjT__r6IfA,1167360,1174000,it's more like the navigating of a new  world without a map or compass a world  that we're by default ill-equipped to
BRjT__r6IfA,1174000,1179760,take on when we begin  and i believe that 99  of success
BRjT__r6IfA,1179760,1188640,is reliant upon the willingness to move  into that great unknown  and allowing adversity to shape us
BRjT__r6IfA,1188799,1194160,but that remaining one percent is a  little bit different
BRjT__r6IfA,1194400,1200080,that one percent  is when we see what we've never seen
BRjT__r6IfA,1200080,1205280,do what we've never done  it's uncovering our best
BRjT__r6IfA,1205280,1210320,in those moments we feel our worst  climbing the highest when we're at our
BRjT__r6IfA,1210320,1215760,lowest when the water rises it's finding  a way to swim
BRjT__r6IfA,1215760,1221360,see the majority of life calls for tiny  adjustments  it's observing and learning and moving
BRjT__r6IfA,1221360,1226559,on  but rarely do we talk about the darkest
BRjT__r6IfA,1226559,1233280,moments when we feel as though we are up  to our neck in the trials and  tribulations of life
BRjT__r6IfA,1233280,1238320,when the world doesn't relay messages of  hope or prosperity no the only incoming
BRjT__r6IfA,1238320,1244960,message  is despair  you're essentially david looking up at
BRjT__r6IfA,1244960,1250960,goliath  perhaps a goliath of your making
BRjT__r6IfA,1250960,1256799,perhaps not but a goliath nonetheless  so why here
BRjT__r6IfA,1256799,1262400,why are these dark moments different  than the 99 percent
BRjT__r6IfA,1262400,1269840,why is a stage provided  at the very time when the limelight  feels further out of reach than it ever
BRjT__r6IfA,1269840,1275520,has  because this this moment is when you
BRjT__r6IfA,1275520,1283760,prove to yourself who you are  you think you've dug deep in the past
BRjT__r6IfA,1284480,1290880,you think you've given your all back  then  no you have no idea what you're capable
BRjT__r6IfA,1290880,1296000,of  the world provides a stage in our  darkest moments
BRjT__r6IfA,1296000,1302080,so that you can pull back the curtains  and illuminate your strength
BRjT__r6IfA,1302080,1307200,it floods your world with adversity so  that you can trust yourself to navigate
BRjT__r6IfA,1307200,1312240,the waters  and if you can find a way here
BRjT__r6IfA,1312240,1317600,when the walls are closing clock is  ticking and water is rising what can't
BRjT__r6IfA,1317600,1323360,you do  have you ever asked yourself that
BRjT__r6IfA,1323360,1329919,question  those moments show us what we can be and
BRjT__r6IfA,1329919,1334720,that is why the one percent is  everything
BRjT__r6IfA,1336559,1342159,why is it that rock bottom becomes a  bridge to so many new tomorrows
BRjT__r6IfA,1342159,1348480,or the losses we dread most become the  change we need most
BRjT__r6IfA,1348480,1353840,the answer is simple  because in those moments we find within
BRjT__r6IfA,1353840,1358200,ourselves the keys to transformation
BRjT__r6IfA,1360320,1366559,see you didn't know  that you can leap that far
BRjT__r6IfA,1368080,1373600,and you didn't know  because you've never been pushed so
BRjT__r6IfA,1373600,1380559,close to the edge  running it so fast a speed
BRjT__r6IfA,1380559,1388159,but in those moments you learn that you  can take flight  you learn you have the power
BRjT__r6IfA,1388159,1394799,to stand again  so while the vast majority of life is
BRjT__r6IfA,1394799,1402000,saying yes when most would say no  it's how we choose to act while immersed
BRjT__r6IfA,1402000,1407039,in our lowest lows  that provides the framework and the
BRjT__r6IfA,1407039,1414480,opportunity  i believe that the tears indicative of  despair streaming down your face look a
BRjT__r6IfA,1414480,1420320,lot like the tears that emerge during  our happiest moments they are the same
BRjT__r6IfA,1420320,1425679,one just precedes the other see despair  gives you a chance to look at life
BRjT__r6IfA,1425679,1431039,differently look at yourself differently  to look in the mirror and understand
BRjT__r6IfA,1431039,1436480,that the reflection looking back is  capable of leading a revolution in your
BRjT__r6IfA,1436480,1443919,soul  and i get how hard that is  how detached from reality it might seem
BRjT__r6IfA,1443919,1449919,but isn't that what tomorrow is  a detachment from the reality the
BRjT__r6IfA,1449919,1456640,parameters and the rules of today  [Music]  it's not until that seed is buried
BRjT__r6IfA,1456640,1465360,beneath the earth that it plants roots  that it takes aim at the sky and when  you are stuck beneath the chaos of life
BRjT__r6IfA,1465360,1470559,you have to know that this is where you  too  transform
BRjT__r6IfA,1470559,1476640,so forget yesterday's shoreline this is  where you build tomorrow's destination
BRjT__r6IfA,1476640,1482080,don't fixate on what is gone when you  can dream of all that is to come and
BRjT__r6IfA,1482080,1488320,don't dwell on who you were when you can  celebrate all you will be
BRjT__r6IfA,1488320,1492400,when the water  rises
BRjT__r6IfA,1493600,1496600,swim
BRjT__r6IfA,1499470,1521190,[Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,1527360,1532720,hope  that bridge  that connects the present to a more
BRjT__r6IfA,1532720,1538159,ideal world  the idea that no obstacle is too big to
BRjT__r6IfA,1538159,1543200,overcome  no situation to dire
BRjT__r6IfA,1543200,1550820,to emerge victorious and  that you are never confined to how  things are
BRjT__r6IfA,1550820,1556640,[Music]  fdr has said we have always held to hope
BRjT__r6IfA,1556640,1562380,the belief the conviction that there is  a better life  a better world beyond the horizon
BRjT__r6IfA,1562380,1568320,[Music]  why does this matter well to put it  simply
BRjT__r6IfA,1568320,1574240,before one can leave the situation they  are in  they have to believe there is another
BRjT__r6IfA,1574240,1580640,path worth taking  it's not always seeing
BRjT__r6IfA,1580720,1586559,but trusting  [Music]  it's a tale of two components
BRjT__r6IfA,1586559,1592320,one  the belief that something better is out  there  and two
BRjT__r6IfA,1592320,1599120,the belief that you are strong enough to  bridge that gap to create that world
BRjT__r6IfA,1599120,1607120,so let's start with number one  there was a study done by kurt richter  in the 1950s and he used rats
BRjT__r6IfA,1607120,1612559,and it was kind of a gruesome experiment  but definitely worth talking about
BRjT__r6IfA,1612559,1617919,because the takeaway is incredible  right and i kind of cherry-picked the  relevant parts
BRjT__r6IfA,1617919,1626000,of the experiment basically he wanted to  delve into the role  that hope plays in our lives
BRjT__r6IfA,1626000,1631919,and what he would do is he would drop  rats into a jar of water and observe  see how long
BRjT__r6IfA,1631919,1638240,they'd swim before they drown and for  the most part these rats would swim for  a minute or two  and then ultimately give up right there
BRjT__r6IfA,1638240,1644159,was this innate feeling of hopelessness  but then he made a change and and when
BRjT__r6IfA,1644159,1649360,they were close to drowning he'd reach  in he'd pick them up he'd hold them for  a little while
BRjT__r6IfA,1649360,1655200,and then he'd place them back in the  water and the results between the two  groups were night and day
BRjT__r6IfA,1655200,1660320,the the rats saw in the second group  that it wasn't over
BRjT__r6IfA,1660320,1666960,and when they were placed back in the  water they had a reason to continue  swimming and they did some of them did  for hours
BRjT__r6IfA,1666960,1672799,the only difference being that they had  hope they saw there was more
BRjT__r6IfA,1672799,1678960,and i don't think that's too different  from us  the situation may be different but the
BRjT__r6IfA,1678960,1684480,rules generally  apply right so much of conceding or  giving up in life
BRjT__r6IfA,1684480,1690480,accepting an existence that falls short  of our ideals  it's when we don't believe in something
BRjT__r6IfA,1690480,1696080,more we stop swimming  we don't give ourselves a chance
BRjT__r6IfA,1696080,1702000,right so instead of creating bridges to  walk on we make walls that lock us in
BRjT__r6IfA,1702000,1709520,hope  is knowing all pain all discomfort  is temporary
BRjT__r6IfA,1709600,1716080,and the second component  is belief in yourself belief in yourself  to traverse that space
BRjT__r6IfA,1716080,1722240,between current and the ideal itself  empowerment  you can be the difference maker
BRjT__r6IfA,1722240,1729360,in your life and others  and it's funny the other day after  reading about the richter experiment
BRjT__r6IfA,1729360,1735200,i was sitting in a friend's house with  my laptop kind of trying to figure out  what to make of it right because the
BRjT__r6IfA,1735200,1740640,idea of hope i knew was powerful and i  wanted to share that story i wanted to  write something that would highlight its
BRjT__r6IfA,1740640,1746960,value but it seemed kind of unfinished  [Music]  or simply part of an explanation i'm
BRjT__r6IfA,1746960,1752559,sitting there thinking about it  and i hear this loud bang over and over
BRjT__r6IfA,1752559,1758320,again and i get up and i run to the back  of the house right to make sure  everything's fine see what's going on
BRjT__r6IfA,1758320,1764159,and my friend standing there with  goggles on this this grin on his face  and a sledgehammer
BRjT__r6IfA,1764159,1769760,and a huge hole in the wall in front of  him and i'm like dude what are you doing
BRjT__r6IfA,1769760,1775440,you just knocked your wall down  he goes yeah i wanted to make uh another  closet
BRjT__r6IfA,1775440,1781200,his family's growing he needs more space  and he just took it upon himself to make  that happen i just looked at him and
BRjT__r6IfA,1781200,1787679,walked back out  started walking the living room and it  hit me this is a component of hope
BRjT__r6IfA,1787679,1794159,seeing what's not there and doing  something about it  right if this swimming experiment is
BRjT__r6IfA,1794159,1801679,step one this has to be step two  in real time  step one believing seeing something more
BRjT__r6IfA,1801679,1806880,step two taking action to change it now  buying into the fact that you have the
BRjT__r6IfA,1806880,1813039,power to change your own world and it's  funny because any house or room i've  ever ever lived in my thoughts always
BRjT__r6IfA,1813039,1819120,you know you look around and this is  this is it right this is the situation  this is what's being given to me how do  i make the most of it
BRjT__r6IfA,1819120,1825760,how do i play within these parameters  not okay this is fine but it could be  better you know by smashing down the
BRjT__r6IfA,1825760,1831360,wall in the back over there creating  something new  and  you know obviously the message here
BRjT__r6IfA,1831360,1838240,isn't about home maintenance right this  is about taking a sledgehammer  to the places in your life
BRjT__r6IfA,1838240,1843520,in which you are not content  so that you can build in its place
BRjT__r6IfA,1843520,1848559,something that matters  you look around to your left your right
BRjT__r6IfA,1848559,1853760,and you're unhappy that's not  the end of the story that's the  beginning of the story that's where the
BRjT__r6IfA,1853760,1859760,wheels hit the road  [Music]  in other words it's looking at life
BRjT__r6IfA,1859760,1865519,with the lens with the the freedom of  knowing things don't have to be what  they are
BRjT__r6IfA,1865519,1871919,they don't have to stay the same until  the universe changes them no they can be  what you make them
BRjT__r6IfA,1871919,1880480,and what life teaches us again  and again  is that walls can be stepped over
BRjT__r6IfA,1880880,1887360,nose can become yeses  impossibles can become commonplace
BRjT__r6IfA,1887360,1894559,but first  there must be  hope  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,1894559,1900559,there must be an understanding that your  world  is a 10 000 foot view of all the little
BRjT__r6IfA,1900559,1908159,stories you tell yourself and the  narratives  you  believe see every day when you wake up
BRjT__r6IfA,1908159,1913360,and take your first steps breathe your  first breaths know that nothing simply
BRjT__r6IfA,1913360,1920559,is  no it is simply chosen and can be  re-made that's what makes life such a
BRjT__r6IfA,1920559,1927600,beautiful thing  it's flexibility it's promised to  provide what has been relentlessly
BRjT__r6IfA,1927600,1934640,sought out  so remember it's when you can't find  your answer when the odds look grim when
BRjT__r6IfA,1934640,1942480,the rest of the world tells you no  that you most  need hope
BRjT__r6IfA,1942480,1949760,hope the power the strength to look  within yourself and remember that one  life can change and two
BRjT__r6IfA,1949760,1955440,you can change it  armed with this understanding nothing is
BRjT__r6IfA,1955440,1964000,impossible when others fail to see the  answer the light in themselves in the  situation you become the reminder that
BRjT__r6IfA,1964000,1969440,light is internally manufactured  we aren't given answers so that we may
BRjT__r6IfA,1969440,1976799,believe them  we are given the opportunity to believe  and thus we create that ending we hope
BRjT__r6IfA,1976799,1982559,to pursue  and without this life is nothing more  than a permanent status quo it's holding
BRjT__r6IfA,1982559,1989120,our hands to the sky and receiving what  life chooses to provide  but that's not why you're here it's not
BRjT__r6IfA,1989120,1994159,why you woke up today not to accept but  to create
BRjT__r6IfA,1994159,2000320,to find hope  in the tragedy and the hardship and to  find within yourself
BRjT__r6IfA,2000320,2006240,the strength to move forward  with whatever you decide
BRjT__r6IfA,2006240,2025410,comes  next  [Music]
BRjT__r6IfA,2027800,2034320,[Music]  you
