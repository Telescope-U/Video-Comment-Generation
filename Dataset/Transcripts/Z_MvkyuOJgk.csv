Z_MvkyuOJgk,32200,33560,I had a bad week
Z_MvkyuOJgk,33560,36120,Spent the evening pretending it wasn’t that deep
Z_MvkyuOJgk,36120,38559,You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
Z_MvkyuOJgk,38560,41000,I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
Z_MvkyuOJgk,41000,43520,You know you take all of my stress right down
Z_MvkyuOJgk,43520,46240,Help me get it off my chest and out
Z_MvkyuOJgk,46240,48160,Into the ether with the rest of this mess
Z_MvkyuOJgk,48160,49480,That just keeps us depressed
Z_MvkyuOJgk,49480,51440,We forget that we’re here right now
Z_MvkyuOJgk,51440,53280,‘Coz we’re living life at a different pace
Z_MvkyuOJgk,53280,54960,Stuck in a constant race keep the pressure on
Z_MvkyuOJgk,54960,55719,You’re bound to break
Z_MvkyuOJgk,55720,56600,Something’s got to change
Z_MvkyuOJgk,56600,58320,We should just be cancelling all our plans
Z_MvkyuOJgk,58320,59280,And not give a damn
Z_MvkyuOJgk,59280,61480,If we’re missing out on what the people think is right
Z_MvkyuOJgk,61480,63399,Seeing through a picture behind the screen
Z_MvkyuOJgk,63400,65840,"And forget to be, lose the conversation for the message"
Z_MvkyuOJgk,65840,66799,that you'll never read
Z_MvkyuOJgk,66800,68040,I think maybe you and me
Z_MvkyuOJgk,68040,70680,Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays
Z_MvkyuOJgk,70680,73360,And then we’ll go all night
Z_MvkyuOJgk,73360,75800,Two stepping with the woman I love
Z_MvkyuOJgk,75800,78600,All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes
Z_MvkyuOJgk,78600,83320,"Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night"
Z_MvkyuOJgk,83320,85920,Oh we had dips and falls in our time
Z_MvkyuOJgk,85920,88680,But we know what it feels to be low then up
Z_MvkyuOJgk,88680,90040,Alone and then loved
Z_MvkyuOJgk,90040,92120,And all we need is us to go
Z_MvkyuOJgk,92120,96040,"All night, night"

Z_MvkyuOJgk,105480,108000,Everything that I been dealing with ain’t even cross my mind
Z_MvkyuOJgk,108000,109680,I don’t see nobody in here but us for real
