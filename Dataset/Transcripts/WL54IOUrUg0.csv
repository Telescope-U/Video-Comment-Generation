WL54IOUrUg0,25680,31210,warm up welcome to santorini where the  local time is just coming up to 10 to 6
WL54IOUrUg0,31210,36800,[Music]  hello from santorini greece it is
WL54IOUrUg0,36800,42480,absolutely surreal to be here right now  this destination has been at the tippity
WL54IOUrUg0,42480,49360,top of my bucket list for  as long as i can remember so i'm so  excited i'm laughing because we have a
WL54IOUrUg0,49360,55360,sweet kitty  who has been hanging out by our cave  house ever since we got here and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,55360,61760,our new best friend and we are just so  enjoying  this place already we arrived last night
WL54IOUrUg0,61760,68560,and thank goodness we had such a smooth  day of travel and we arrived around
WL54IOUrUg0,68560,75200,4 35 pm local time  and we  went to check into our airbnb we did
WL54IOUrUg0,75200,81360,decide to rent a car which i think will  be very convenient because we'd like to  explore as much of the island as
WL54IOUrUg0,81360,87920,possible  so we checked into our airbnb and let me  give you a tour because this place is
WL54IOUrUg0,87920,92960,absolutely beautiful  so we're in this cozy cave house you
WL54IOUrUg0,92960,99439,walk down a flight of stairs and then  you have this cozy bed which we slept
WL54IOUrUg0,99439,105920,phenomenally it was so relaxing and  you actually hear the ocean waves
WL54IOUrUg0,105920,113439,crashing against the rocks because the  beach is right outside the door so it is  so glorious and we have our own
WL54IOUrUg0,113439,118640,natural sound machine while we sleep and  the shower is really cool because it's
WL54IOUrUg0,118640,124479,the architecture is just so  extraordinary and  unlike anything we've experienced before
WL54IOUrUg0,124479,130319,so we are soaking it up and absolutely  love this place and we'll be staying  here one more night and we'll see what
WL54IOUrUg0,130319,136640,else we explore today but it was so  lovely because we were able to enjoy  dinner at a local place that's actually
WL54IOUrUg0,136640,143520,right outside our airbnb i'm actually  looking at the table where we  ate dinner last night and that was such
WL54IOUrUg0,143520,150160,a fun experience it just is so  incredible to be right along the sea and  have a fresh dining experience so we
WL54IOUrUg0,150160,156800,asked what the fish of the day was and  he brought out all of the fish that the  fishermen caught that very day and we
WL54IOUrUg0,156800,163519,got to pick our choice and i was not  prepared to just have a whole fish  served in front of me but it was a great
WL54IOUrUg0,163519,171840,authentic and beautiful experience so  really thankful and really excited for  the next few days of exploring
WL54IOUrUg0,172310,183590,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,184080,190640,we started our first day in santorini by  driving around and soaking up all the  views and we ended up pulling over at
WL54IOUrUg0,190640,197120,this beautiful viewpoint called the  akritiri sunset viewpoint and of course  it's a beautiful place to watch the
WL54IOUrUg0,197120,203599,sunset but it was gorgeous in the middle  of the day as well you could see  beautiful views of the aegean sea and
WL54IOUrUg0,203599,210560,different points of the island so we  enjoyed stopping here and taking it all  in and then we drove over to a village
WL54IOUrUg0,210560,218400,called gross and we enjoyed breakfast  here this is such a cute village that we  spent pretty much all morning in and we
WL54IOUrUg0,218400,224000,had a lovely meal at a bistro cafe  called a gays and we had it all to
WL54IOUrUg0,224000,231280,ourselves which is something we noticed  that if you wake up on the earlier side  you will most likely have cafes mainly
WL54IOUrUg0,231280,237840,to yourself and then people will start  rolling in later in the day but we  absolutely loved this place it was so
WL54IOUrUg0,237840,244640,charming and the views were also  stunning and we ordered the traditional  greek breakfast which was a combination
WL54IOUrUg0,244640,249680,of different fruit and pastries and it  was lovely and then we also ordered some
WL54IOUrUg0,249680,256560,toast with scrambled eggs and naturally  we ordered some greek coffee and a  cappuccino freddo and also a freshly
WL54IOUrUg0,256560,262240,squeezed orange juice so the freddo  cappuccino is a classic island drink in
WL54IOUrUg0,262240,267280,greece and it truly is definitely a  preferred drink of choice especially in
WL54IOUrUg0,267280,273440,the warmer months so this drink is  typically espresso and frothed skim milk
WL54IOUrUg0,273440,278880,i love how frothy and thick and creamy  the milk is it's super fun and very very
WL54IOUrUg0,278880,284880,delicious and you can choose to sweeten  it or have it unsweet i typically vouch  for unsweet because you can really taste
WL54IOUrUg0,284880,292160,that strong and robust coffee flavor and  then we also ordered the traditional  greek coffee which greek coffee is a
WL54IOUrUg0,292160,297199,strong brew coffee which is typically  served with more foam on the top and
WL54IOUrUg0,297199,303919,then really finely ground coffee grounds  at the bottom of the cup and it's  typically prepared with those finely
WL54IOUrUg0,303919,310479,ground coffee beans and doesn't use  filtering so it's a little unique but  essentially you just sip on it until you
WL54IOUrUg0,310479,316800,reach the grounds at the bottom of your  mug after breakfast we hiked around and  explored pier groves even more and our
WL54IOUrUg0,316800,322800,main destination was the pirgo's  kalisti's castle and on our way there we
WL54IOUrUg0,322800,329600,stumbled upon many different viewpoints  where we could see  a lot of the island and beautiful homes
WL54IOUrUg0,329600,335199,and wildlife and donkeys so it was  really great to sort of just roam around
WL54IOUrUg0,335199,340639,and if we saw a corner that sparked our  interest we could go that way and truly
WL54IOUrUg0,340639,346880,you've probably heard this before when  people are referring to greece but  every single corner seemingly just has
WL54IOUrUg0,346880,352800,something interesting and beautiful to  look at and witness so  one of my favorite parts of our trip was
WL54IOUrUg0,352800,359530,simply roaming around these beautiful  villages and taking it all in
WL54IOUrUg0,359530,396759,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,402420,409199,[Music]  something you will notice about  santorini is that there are family
WL54IOUrUg0,409199,416880,churches everywhere pretty much  everywhere you look you can see a church  in sight and they're all so beautiful
WL54IOUrUg0,416880,423180,and have so much detail and it's really  special to see these churches sprinkled  throughout the island
WL54IOUrUg0,423180,477120,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,477120,483680,once we had our fill of exploring this  town we went back to our rental car and  we stopped at the grocery store on the
WL54IOUrUg0,483680,488879,way to our next destination so that we  could pick up some bottles of water  something sort of interesting about the
WL54IOUrUg0,488879,494400,greek islands is that bottled water is  very inexpensive typically in america if
WL54IOUrUg0,494400,499919,you want to buy a water bottle it is  about  it depends on the size but here a really
WL54IOUrUg0,499919,507039,large water bottle would only be about  one or two euros but apparently the  water price is regulated here since
WL54IOUrUg0,507039,513360,there's no natural drinking water source  on the island so they really regulate  the prices to make it accessible that's
WL54IOUrUg0,513360,518399,a little fun fact for you but i always  love to go in grocery stores in  different countries because you
WL54IOUrUg0,518399,525440,typically are able to see something  interesting while you're there and our  next destination was the town of emporio
WL54IOUrUg0,525440,531839,which is another really beautiful  charming town to explore we were  starting to get hungry so we stopped for
WL54IOUrUg0,531839,538880,lunch at the old barber shop which is  such a gem the greek salad was amazing  and then we also ordered this hilo
WL54IOUrUg0,538880,544320,wrapped feta drizzled with honey and  sesame seeds it was phenomenal we
WL54IOUrUg0,544320,548120,absolutely loved this
WL54IOUrUg0,557760,564160,on this day we had a little drama with  our rental car the seat belt and the  driver's seat stopped working it would
WL54IOUrUg0,564160,569360,get stuck randomly so the people we  rented the car from came to help us out
WL54IOUrUg0,569360,576000,for a little bit and throughout our trip  it would just stop working so brandon  was able to kind of hack it and get it
WL54IOUrUg0,576000,581440,working again but there's a little bit  of annoyance but that always happens  with traveling even though there's so
WL54IOUrUg0,581440,586720,much beauty and fun and enjoyment there  typically are some travel curve balls as
WL54IOUrUg0,586720,594160,well as we were driving out of emporia i  saw on the map that there were these  beautiful windmills so we drove over to
WL54IOUrUg0,594160,599200,go check them out and it was so stunning  to see these windmills are very popular
WL54IOUrUg0,599200,606160,on the greek islands and the windmills  of emporia are fun to visit because  there actually are some iconic windmill
WL54IOUrUg0,606160,611200,ruins that you can go and visit and see  and sort of visualize the history as
WL54IOUrUg0,611200,618000,you're standing in front of these  crumbling windmill ruins  we had quite the morning in santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,618000,624560,exploring we love it so much already and  we had some down time in the room kind  of relaxed got out of the sun the
WL54IOUrUg0,624560,630320,mediterranean sun hits different it's  definitely  nice and toasty so gorgeous but it
WL54IOUrUg0,630320,635680,definitely feels like brighter here if  that makes sense doesn't it well there  are also
WL54IOUrUg0,635680,641600,no clouds yeah no clouds today yeah so  beaming down yeah and everything is so
WL54IOUrUg0,641600,648640,bright and white around you so it just  reflects it's glorious but also very  toasty so we had our nice down time and
WL54IOUrUg0,648640,655279,now we're on our way to red beach we're  gonna try to walk there from our room we  couldn't find a path on the maps but
WL54IOUrUg0,655279,662399,hopefully we can find a way  we said hello to our sweet cave house  cat truly the cats of greece were a
WL54IOUrUg0,662399,670399,highlight for me i love them so much and  i'm so glad we decided to walk over to  red beach because it was absolutely so
WL54IOUrUg0,670399,676880,beautiful and so unique of course  because of the red color and just the  beautiful cliff sides and here's a
WL54IOUrUg0,676880,683519,little history about santorini that i  didn't realize until traveling here but  the island of santorini is actually
WL54IOUrUg0,683519,689200,built up by layers of lava created by  shield volcanoes and it had experienced
WL54IOUrUg0,689200,694640,three significant eruptions so that's  why you see the overlapping calderas and
WL54IOUrUg0,694640,700800,there really is so much history when it  comes to  this volcanic island and why the
WL54IOUrUg0,700800,707600,landscape is so unique it's really due  to the volcanoes and the  lava so that's something i never
WL54IOUrUg0,707600,714160,realized but that's why you see so many  different color variations and  different elevations it's very very
WL54IOUrUg0,714160,717160,interesting
WL54IOUrUg0,733839,739440,i saw you down the motorway there was  something about you that day
WL54IOUrUg0,739440,744480,i can still hear the shimmering sound
WL54IOUrUg0,744480,751040,the hill is near let's get right up  walk up to every top we couldn't tell
WL54IOUrUg0,751040,758079,the sky from the ground  i know my life
WL54IOUrUg0,758079,765760,never be the same after that day  you wrap me around your fingers and you
WL54IOUrUg0,765760,773120,stay  i don't ever wanna be alone
WL54IOUrUg0,774730,779709,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,780800,785839,after our time by the sea we walked back  to our airbnb and freshened up and
WL54IOUrUg0,785839,791839,changed for dinner and on our way to  dinner we stopped at this other  viewpoint called the heart of santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,791839,797680,which was absolutely gorgeous there's  tons of places to park if you want to  come visit this as well
WL54IOUrUg0,797680,803120,and we really loved it you can kind of  hike around to all these pretty  viewpoints but it was incredibly
WL54IOUrUg0,803120,811040,peaceful and awe inspiring to watch the  sunset over the sea then we went over to  theophaneus food experience which was
WL54IOUrUg0,811040,818000,such a fabulous place to enjoy a meal  they actually had live music this night  as well which really enhanced and added
WL54IOUrUg0,818000,825680,on to the atmosphere so we loved it we  got this beautiful salad it's actually  their house salad but had some special
WL54IOUrUg0,825680,832320,little touches and fruit it was divine  and we also had some grilled halloumi  cheese which is one of my favorites so
WL54IOUrUg0,832320,838880,we enjoyed that and then a beautiful  pasta dish and we ended with some  baklava which is the best baklava that
WL54IOUrUg0,838880,845519,i've ever had and this was actually  brandon's favorite meal of the trip so  that's saying something
WL54IOUrUg0,845680,851440,good morning we are off to another day  of exploring santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,851440,856560,we are dressed for hiking we are going  to be i didn't realize how much hiking
WL54IOUrUg0,856560,863360,there is on this island the terrain  definitely is built for some beautiful  hikes so our first stop is breakfast and
WL54IOUrUg0,863360,869760,then we're gonna go to a lighthouse that  looks incredible kind of on the tip of  the island and then we're gonna make our
WL54IOUrUg0,869760,876800,way over to  ancient thera and then yeah later today  so that's kind of the rundown but really
WL54IOUrUg0,876800,884160,excited b what was your favorite part of  yesterday  [Applause]  uh probably dinner dinner yeah dinner
WL54IOUrUg0,884160,891040,was so fabulous we love dinner what was  my favorite part  your favorite part oh you're gonna
WL54IOUrUg0,891040,897199,answer for me  probably  our  [Applause]
WL54IOUrUg0,897199,902240,hike in the morning and early afternoon  going through all the towns yes
WL54IOUrUg0,902240,909600,there goes pirgos here goes yes not sure  if we're pronouncing everything  correctly but all the towns have just
WL54IOUrUg0,909600,923179,been an absolute dream  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,923360,930399,for breakfast we went over to the acro  theory bistro cafe and this was another  beautiful breakfast we got some toast
WL54IOUrUg0,930399,936320,with eggs and a side of fruit and greek  yogurt which the greek yogurt i expected
WL54IOUrUg0,936320,941360,it to be even yummier here but it did  not disappoint it was so incredibly
WL54IOUrUg0,941360,948759,creamy and just fresh we absolutely  loved it and had it every single day
WL54IOUrUg0,951410,976509,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,977519,985360,after our meal we went over to the acro  terry lighthouse which is absolutely a  must do if you ask me it is sort of by
WL54IOUrUg0,985360,992480,itself on one of the tips of the islands  so you will need to drive there or take  an atv or scooter but i absolutely think
WL54IOUrUg0,992480,999120,it's worth it the views here are beyond  stunning and there was this nice food  truck where you could order some coffee
WL54IOUrUg0,999120,1004720,and food and enjoy the views and hike  around so i really think it is a must do
WL54IOUrUg0,1004720,1011839,and we probably spent an hour and a half  here just soaking in the views and we  ended up ordering some slovakia and
WL54IOUrUg0,1011839,1020210,another coffee and just sat at this cute  little bistro table cliffside looking at  all the boats going by
WL54IOUrUg0,1020210,1023419,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1028000,1036349,do  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1040730,1055959,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1056400,1063840,after our time at the lighthouse we made  our way up to ancient thera which was  such an experience so ancient thera is
WL54IOUrUg0,1063840,1070000,located on the top of mesa voonu  mountain and it's about 365 meters high
WL54IOUrUg0,1070000,1077360,so you feel like you're at the tippity  top of santorini when you make the trek  up here and for us the drive up was a
WL54IOUrUg0,1077360,1082480,bit  much i mean we totally did it brandon  did such a good job but it was very
WL54IOUrUg0,1082480,1088960,steep and maybe that is coming from two  floridians who are  used to being at sea level or below sea
WL54IOUrUg0,1088960,1096559,level with very flat roads so you are  driving up the side of this mountain and  it's very curvy and windy but the trek
WL54IOUrUg0,1096559,1103600,up was totally worth it because ancient  thera is so incredibly fascinating  because you see the ruins of this
WL54IOUrUg0,1103600,1109120,ancient civilization and it provides so  much history so when you arrive you will
WL54IOUrUg0,1109120,1116000,need to pay six euros to enter the ruins  which we do think is worth it because  there really is so much to see it's a
WL54IOUrUg0,1116000,1121039,lot more expansive than i even imagined  you're able to see cemeteries theater
WL54IOUrUg0,1121039,1126480,markets temples churches baths and  again you really can use your
WL54IOUrUg0,1126480,1131679,imagination to take in these ruins and  picture what life may have been like in
WL54IOUrUg0,1131679,1138880,these ancient times if you're enamored  by history at all this is definitely a  must visit this was actually brandon's
WL54IOUrUg0,1138880,1146000,favorite activity of the trip he could  have spent all day here i will mention  though it is quite toasty especially if
WL54IOUrUg0,1146000,1151600,you come in the summertime you are at  the top of this mountain and if there's  no clouds in the sky the sun will be
WL54IOUrUg0,1151600,1156880,beating down on you  so definitely keep that in mind bring  plenty of water and while we were there
WL54IOUrUg0,1156880,1163360,there was a food truck as well so you  are able to grab a snack and drinks so  that's definitely super convenient and
WL54IOUrUg0,1163360,1166360,appreciated
WL54IOUrUg0,1169800,1178140,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1184000,1191120,as we were leaving ancient thera we were  talking to this pastor from italy and we  saw these donkeys which it was cute
WL54IOUrUg0,1191120,1196799,because he said oh donkeys are even  better than horses because we couldn't  tell if they were donkeys or horses
WL54IOUrUg0,1196799,1202799,because we're not so familiar with them  but he said oh yeah it's a donkey and  they're better than horses because jesus
WL54IOUrUg0,1202799,1208720,came in on a donkey and i just thought  that was really cute and a fun fact  because donkeys are very prevalent on
WL54IOUrUg0,1208720,1214880,the island of santorini a donkey is  actually stronger than a horse of the  same size which is something i didn't
WL54IOUrUg0,1214880,1220640,realize but they're used often to help  carry things especially along the  mountain side
WL54IOUrUg0,1220640,1227600,then we made our way over to ia which is  where we spent our final night on the  island and this is probably the location
WL54IOUrUg0,1227600,1234080,that you daydream of when you think of  santorini it is a coastal town on the  northwestern tip of the island and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,1234080,1240720,known for those beautiful white-washed  houses that are carved into the cliff  tops and you really just have such
WL54IOUrUg0,1240720,1246080,stunning views of the caldera and the  water so this is such a beautiful town
WL54IOUrUg0,1246080,1251679,that i was so thankful to get to  experience  hello from ia i cannot believe this
WL54IOUrUg0,1251679,1257520,place is real and that it exists i'm  quite emotional to be here to be honest  it is just
WL54IOUrUg0,1257520,1265200,absolutely unreal so incredibly peaceful  and this home that we're staying in is
WL54IOUrUg0,1265200,1270960,magnificent there really is  not words to describe how beautiful it  is and
WL54IOUrUg0,1270960,1276240,cannot wait to watch the sunset later  right now we just  freshened up a little bit i put on a
WL54IOUrUg0,1276240,1281679,different top and we are gonna go  find some food find something delicious  to eat
WL54IOUrUg0,1281679,1287200,and we'll probably walk around for a bit  and then come back to the home to watch  the sunset
WL54IOUrUg0,1287200,1293679,and go out later tonight for some tapas  and live music so that's the rundown of  what we're hoping to do but brandon and
WL54IOUrUg0,1293679,1299280,i were just talking about how much we've  already done on this trip and all the  experiences we've had already and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,1299280,1306320,only been a little over a day can you  believe that so we're just  so so thankful and truly falling in love
WL54IOUrUg0,1306320,1311919,in love with this country  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1311919,1318720,here's our stunning airbnb this is one  of those airbnbs that i've had on my  wish list for many many years and it was
WL54IOUrUg0,1318720,1325039,surreal to be able to stay here and it  was great that we had the option to only  stay here one night because i feel like
WL54IOUrUg0,1325039,1330400,with some airbnbs they have a minimum  stay policy but this one allowed you to
WL54IOUrUg0,1330400,1336480,just stay one night because it is more  of a splurge so if you wanted to space  it out a bit you could but it was
WL54IOUrUg0,1336480,1342240,absolutely worth it in my opinion just  to be able to  experience ia in this way and have our
WL54IOUrUg0,1342240,1348559,own pool and the beautiful cave house  i'm just so inspired by this  architecture so i was loving every
WL54IOUrUg0,1348559,1357120,second of it  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1357120,1373650,[Applause]  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1377120,1383840,once we settled in a bit we decided to  just roam around the streets and see  what we could see i didn't realize how
WL54IOUrUg0,1383840,1391600,much shopping there was in ia there were  so many different souvenir shops and  artisans and live music it really is a
WL54IOUrUg0,1391600,1399520,bustling place and there are so many  beautiful restaurants to enjoy so we  ended up going to pito euro which was my
WL54IOUrUg0,1399520,1406480,favorite meal of the trip it was quite  simple we had these beautiful euros with  chicken salaki and it had the tzatziki
WL54IOUrUg0,1406480,1413440,fresh cut bell pepper  and i love how they put the  fried potatoes in the gyro it's so
WL54IOUrUg0,1413440,1419919,delicious and adds a nice crunch so we  had that and some pita and hummus and of
WL54IOUrUg0,1419919,1427520,course another greek salad we strolled  around a bit more and then stopped for  some gelato at lolita's which was very
WL54IOUrUg0,1427520,1432710,delicious and quite refreshing on such a  warm day
WL54IOUrUg0,1432710,1468010,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1468799,1474960,and to cap off the night we ended up  just staying at the airbnb which we  really just wanted to soak up every
WL54IOUrUg0,1474960,1480320,moment we could at the airbnb since it  was so glorious and we had our dip pool
WL54IOUrUg0,1480320,1487520,to enjoy and the balcony  there are so many places to hang out and  just soak it all in so we watched the
WL54IOUrUg0,1487520,1493039,sunset in the pool and really enjoyed it  thoroughly it was so beautiful it was so
WL54IOUrUg0,1493039,1499679,peaceful even though there's people all  around you  it just felt so so calm it smelled like
WL54IOUrUg0,1499679,1505120,incense and salt and there were people  laughing people getting engaged and
WL54IOUrUg0,1505120,1512000,people enjoying beautiful meals you  could hear the forks clicking and live  music it was truly just one of those
WL54IOUrUg0,1512000,1517760,nights that i hope to remember for the  rest of my life because  it was absolutely a dream come true and
WL54IOUrUg0,1517760,1551339,just something so heavenly  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1553620,1561480,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1562980,1566130,[Applause]
WL54IOUrUg0,1568000,1571000,okay
WL54IOUrUg0,1574140,1600880,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1600880,1606240,the castle of ia is an incredibly  popular sunset viewing location so if
WL54IOUrUg0,1606240,1613600,you go at sunset just expect it to be  crowded because it's definitely the  place to be but we ended up going in the
WL54IOUrUg0,1613600,1620400,morning so it was quite calm and  peaceful and the castle of ia was  actually built by the venetians and much
WL54IOUrUg0,1620400,1626640,like many of the other villages and  homes on the island the inhabitants  built their houses close to each other
WL54IOUrUg0,1626640,1633120,in hard to reach places among the cliffs  because during the middle ages there  were so many pirates that would come
WL54IOUrUg0,1633120,1638399,after these greek islands and try to  steal and they really just use this
WL54IOUrUg0,1638399,1645399,landscape as a way to protect and keep  an eye out on the water
WL54IOUrUg0,1655120,1661520,good morning from the glorious santorini  it is truly heavenly here
WL54IOUrUg0,1661520,1666880,yeah and yeah yes it's so glorious but
WL54IOUrUg0,1666880,1672000,unfortunately it's our last day in  santorini but fortunately we are heading
WL54IOUrUg0,1672000,1677120,over to milos later today  so we're going to catch a ferry in a few
WL54IOUrUg0,1677120,1682159,hours like six hours actually so we have  quite a quite a bit of time still and
WL54IOUrUg0,1682159,1688080,we're going to go to thura which is the  capital of santorini and explore  shop
WL54IOUrUg0,1688080,1694399,eat all of that good stuff and then  we'll catch our ferry but  what is your
WL54IOUrUg0,1694399,1699919,thought of santorini it's great it's  great it's great it's an understatement
WL54IOUrUg0,1699919,1706559,everywhere it's pretty  yeah seriously everywhere you from  landscapes and
WL54IOUrUg0,1706559,1712080,yeah it's like every spot of the island  is a little different which is really  neat would you say it's um worth it to
WL54IOUrUg0,1712080,1717760,rent a car  yeah yeah i think it was worth it i mean  you definitely could take buses or
WL54IOUrUg0,1717760,1723679,transportation but if you want to see  all different parts of the island having  a car is super convenient and parking is
WL54IOUrUg0,1723679,1729279,fairly easy even in popular villages  like es so yeah i was impressed like by
WL54IOUrUg0,1729279,1736480,that it's not like that back in the  states you have to pay to park  everywhere and it's hard to park yeah  it's different yeah so that was a good
WL54IOUrUg0,1736480,1743440,surprise and it's just absolutely  glorious and we're so thankful for our  time here so i'll show you what we get
WL54IOUrUg0,1743440,1752689,up to in thira  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1754480,1761679,on our way to thera we stopped in the  town of immoral vaguely which isn't far  from ia at all and it is home to the
WL54IOUrUg0,1761679,1766799,skaros rock which is such an incredible  sight to see highly recommend visiting
WL54IOUrUg0,1766799,1773279,if you have the chance it is this  incredible rock formation and it was  actually considered the most important
WL54IOUrUg0,1773279,1778480,of santorini's five castle fortresses  because the rock was actually inhabited
WL54IOUrUg0,1778480,1786559,in medieval times and due to the unique  landscape of the fortress it offered a  lot more protection from the pirates so
WL54IOUrUg0,1786559,1792880,there's another fun fact but you can  actually hike along the rock and this  whole town was also very beautiful and
WL54IOUrUg0,1792880,1799120,would be a wonderful place to stay and  for our last meal in santorini we went  to lucky's slovakias in thera and this
WL54IOUrUg0,1799120,1806320,was a great place you can dine in but it  is quite small so we just grabbed and go  and walked around a bit and also got a
WL54IOUrUg0,1806320,1813679,juice we were able to enjoy some food  and take in the sights before heading to  the port our ferry was quite delayed
WL54IOUrUg0,1813679,1820559,unfortunately as you can see the water  was quite choppy this day so there was  some weather delays so we just hung out
WL54IOUrUg0,1820559,1826320,at the port for a while which  there isn't a whole lot to do at this  port i mean since we had such long
WL54IOUrUg0,1826320,1832399,delays we could have  taken a taxi back to town but we were  already here and we weren't sure what
WL54IOUrUg0,1832399,1839520,the situation would be so we kind of  just hung out at the port for quite a  bit and got some ice cream and
WL54IOUrUg0,1839520,1845600,just tried to make the most of it but it  definitely was a long travel day to get  to milos but i'm excited to show you
WL54IOUrUg0,1845600,1857050,what we got up to there  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1859840,1865360,[Music]  and that's going to be it for the  santorini vlog but thank you so much for
WL54IOUrUg0,1865360,1871039,following along  the view oh yeah i'll show you one last  time i know that's right in front of us
WL54IOUrUg0,1871039,1876320,yeah it's so gorgeous catch up with you  later once we're in milos for part two
WL54IOUrUg0,1876320,1882930,of our greece trip  [Music]
vid,start,end,text
WL54IOUrUg0,280,25680,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,25680,31210,warm up welcome to santorini where the  local time is just coming up to 10 to 6
WL54IOUrUg0,31210,36800,[Music]  hello from santorini greece it is
WL54IOUrUg0,36800,42480,absolutely surreal to be here right now  this destination has been at the tippity
WL54IOUrUg0,42480,49360,top of my bucket list for  as long as i can remember so i'm so  excited i'm laughing because we have a
WL54IOUrUg0,49360,55360,sweet kitty  who has been hanging out by our cave  house ever since we got here and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,55360,61760,our new best friend and we are just so  enjoying  this place already we arrived last night
WL54IOUrUg0,61760,68560,and thank goodness we had such a smooth  day of travel and we arrived around
WL54IOUrUg0,68560,75200,4 35 pm local time  and we  went to check into our airbnb we did
WL54IOUrUg0,75200,81360,decide to rent a car which i think will  be very convenient because we'd like to  explore as much of the island as
WL54IOUrUg0,81360,87920,possible  so we checked into our airbnb and let me  give you a tour because this place is
WL54IOUrUg0,87920,92960,absolutely beautiful  so we're in this cozy cave house you
WL54IOUrUg0,92960,99439,walk down a flight of stairs and then  you have this cozy bed which we slept
WL54IOUrUg0,99439,105920,phenomenally it was so relaxing and  you actually hear the ocean waves
WL54IOUrUg0,105920,113439,crashing against the rocks because the  beach is right outside the door so it is  so glorious and we have our own
WL54IOUrUg0,113439,118640,natural sound machine while we sleep and  the shower is really cool because it's
WL54IOUrUg0,118640,124479,the architecture is just so  extraordinary and  unlike anything we've experienced before
WL54IOUrUg0,124479,130319,so we are soaking it up and absolutely  love this place and we'll be staying  here one more night and we'll see what
WL54IOUrUg0,130319,136640,else we explore today but it was so  lovely because we were able to enjoy  dinner at a local place that's actually
WL54IOUrUg0,136640,143520,right outside our airbnb i'm actually  looking at the table where we  ate dinner last night and that was such
WL54IOUrUg0,143520,150160,a fun experience it just is so  incredible to be right along the sea and  have a fresh dining experience so we
WL54IOUrUg0,150160,156800,asked what the fish of the day was and  he brought out all of the fish that the  fishermen caught that very day and we
WL54IOUrUg0,156800,163519,got to pick our choice and i was not  prepared to just have a whole fish  served in front of me but it was a great
WL54IOUrUg0,163519,171840,authentic and beautiful experience so  really thankful and really excited for  the next few days of exploring
WL54IOUrUg0,172310,183590,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,184080,190640,we started our first day in santorini by  driving around and soaking up all the  views and we ended up pulling over at
WL54IOUrUg0,190640,197120,this beautiful viewpoint called the  akritiri sunset viewpoint and of course  it's a beautiful place to watch the
WL54IOUrUg0,197120,203599,sunset but it was gorgeous in the middle  of the day as well you could see  beautiful views of the aegean sea and
WL54IOUrUg0,203599,210560,different points of the island so we  enjoyed stopping here and taking it all  in and then we drove over to a village
WL54IOUrUg0,210560,218400,called gross and we enjoyed breakfast  here this is such a cute village that we  spent pretty much all morning in and we
WL54IOUrUg0,218400,224000,had a lovely meal at a bistro cafe  called a gays and we had it all to
WL54IOUrUg0,224000,231280,ourselves which is something we noticed  that if you wake up on the earlier side  you will most likely have cafes mainly
WL54IOUrUg0,231280,237840,to yourself and then people will start  rolling in later in the day but we  absolutely loved this place it was so
WL54IOUrUg0,237840,244640,charming and the views were also  stunning and we ordered the traditional  greek breakfast which was a combination
WL54IOUrUg0,244640,249680,of different fruit and pastries and it  was lovely and then we also ordered some
WL54IOUrUg0,249680,256560,toast with scrambled eggs and naturally  we ordered some greek coffee and a  cappuccino freddo and also a freshly
WL54IOUrUg0,256560,262240,squeezed orange juice so the freddo  cappuccino is a classic island drink in
WL54IOUrUg0,262240,267280,greece and it truly is definitely a  preferred drink of choice especially in
WL54IOUrUg0,267280,273440,the warmer months so this drink is  typically espresso and frothed skim milk
WL54IOUrUg0,273440,278880,i love how frothy and thick and creamy  the milk is it's super fun and very very
WL54IOUrUg0,278880,284880,delicious and you can choose to sweeten  it or have it unsweet i typically vouch  for unsweet because you can really taste
WL54IOUrUg0,284880,292160,that strong and robust coffee flavor and  then we also ordered the traditional  greek coffee which greek coffee is a
WL54IOUrUg0,292160,297199,strong brew coffee which is typically  served with more foam on the top and
WL54IOUrUg0,297199,303919,then really finely ground coffee grounds  at the bottom of the cup and it's  typically prepared with those finely
WL54IOUrUg0,303919,310479,ground coffee beans and doesn't use  filtering so it's a little unique but  essentially you just sip on it until you
WL54IOUrUg0,310479,316800,reach the grounds at the bottom of your  mug after breakfast we hiked around and  explored pier groves even more and our
WL54IOUrUg0,316800,322800,main destination was the pirgo's  kalisti's castle and on our way there we
WL54IOUrUg0,322800,329600,stumbled upon many different viewpoints  where we could see  a lot of the island and beautiful homes
WL54IOUrUg0,329600,335199,and wildlife and donkeys so it was  really great to sort of just roam around
WL54IOUrUg0,335199,340639,and if we saw a corner that sparked our  interest we could go that way and truly
WL54IOUrUg0,340639,346880,you've probably heard this before when  people are referring to greece but  every single corner seemingly just has
WL54IOUrUg0,346880,352800,something interesting and beautiful to  look at and witness so  one of my favorite parts of our trip was
WL54IOUrUg0,352800,359530,simply roaming around these beautiful  villages and taking it all in
WL54IOUrUg0,359530,396759,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,402420,409199,[Music]  something you will notice about  santorini is that there are family
WL54IOUrUg0,409199,416880,churches everywhere pretty much  everywhere you look you can see a church  in sight and they're all so beautiful
WL54IOUrUg0,416880,423180,and have so much detail and it's really  special to see these churches sprinkled  throughout the island
WL54IOUrUg0,423180,477120,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,477120,483680,once we had our fill of exploring this  town we went back to our rental car and  we stopped at the grocery store on the
WL54IOUrUg0,483680,488879,way to our next destination so that we  could pick up some bottles of water  something sort of interesting about the
WL54IOUrUg0,488879,494400,greek islands is that bottled water is  very inexpensive typically in america if
WL54IOUrUg0,494400,499919,you want to buy a water bottle it is  about  it depends on the size but here a really
WL54IOUrUg0,499919,507039,large water bottle would only be about  one or two euros but apparently the  water price is regulated here since
WL54IOUrUg0,507039,513360,there's no natural drinking water source  on the island so they really regulate  the prices to make it accessible that's
WL54IOUrUg0,513360,518399,a little fun fact for you but i always  love to go in grocery stores in  different countries because you
WL54IOUrUg0,518399,525440,typically are able to see something  interesting while you're there and our  next destination was the town of emporio
WL54IOUrUg0,525440,531839,which is another really beautiful  charming town to explore we were  starting to get hungry so we stopped for
WL54IOUrUg0,531839,538880,lunch at the old barber shop which is  such a gem the greek salad was amazing  and then we also ordered this hilo
WL54IOUrUg0,538880,544320,wrapped feta drizzled with honey and  sesame seeds it was phenomenal we
WL54IOUrUg0,544320,548120,absolutely loved this
WL54IOUrUg0,557760,564160,on this day we had a little drama with  our rental car the seat belt and the  driver's seat stopped working it would
WL54IOUrUg0,564160,569360,get stuck randomly so the people we  rented the car from came to help us out
WL54IOUrUg0,569360,576000,for a little bit and throughout our trip  it would just stop working so brandon  was able to kind of hack it and get it
WL54IOUrUg0,576000,581440,working again but there's a little bit  of annoyance but that always happens  with traveling even though there's so
WL54IOUrUg0,581440,586720,much beauty and fun and enjoyment there  typically are some travel curve balls as
WL54IOUrUg0,586720,594160,well as we were driving out of emporia i  saw on the map that there were these  beautiful windmills so we drove over to
WL54IOUrUg0,594160,599200,go check them out and it was so stunning  to see these windmills are very popular
WL54IOUrUg0,599200,606160,on the greek islands and the windmills  of emporia are fun to visit because  there actually are some iconic windmill
WL54IOUrUg0,606160,611200,ruins that you can go and visit and see  and sort of visualize the history as
WL54IOUrUg0,611200,618000,you're standing in front of these  crumbling windmill ruins  we had quite the morning in santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,618000,624560,exploring we love it so much already and  we had some down time in the room kind  of relaxed got out of the sun the
WL54IOUrUg0,624560,630320,mediterranean sun hits different it's  definitely  nice and toasty so gorgeous but it
WL54IOUrUg0,630320,635680,definitely feels like brighter here if  that makes sense doesn't it well there  are also
WL54IOUrUg0,635680,641600,no clouds yeah no clouds today yeah so  beaming down yeah and everything is so
WL54IOUrUg0,641600,648640,bright and white around you so it just  reflects it's glorious but also very  toasty so we had our nice down time and
WL54IOUrUg0,648640,655279,now we're on our way to red beach we're  gonna try to walk there from our room we  couldn't find a path on the maps but
WL54IOUrUg0,655279,662399,hopefully we can find a way  we said hello to our sweet cave house  cat truly the cats of greece were a
WL54IOUrUg0,662399,670399,highlight for me i love them so much and  i'm so glad we decided to walk over to  red beach because it was absolutely so
WL54IOUrUg0,670399,676880,beautiful and so unique of course  because of the red color and just the  beautiful cliff sides and here's a
WL54IOUrUg0,676880,683519,little history about santorini that i  didn't realize until traveling here but  the island of santorini is actually
WL54IOUrUg0,683519,689200,built up by layers of lava created by  shield volcanoes and it had experienced
WL54IOUrUg0,689200,694640,three significant eruptions so that's  why you see the overlapping calderas and
WL54IOUrUg0,694640,700800,there really is so much history when it  comes to  this volcanic island and why the
WL54IOUrUg0,700800,707600,landscape is so unique it's really due  to the volcanoes and the  lava so that's something i never
WL54IOUrUg0,707600,714160,realized but that's why you see so many  different color variations and  different elevations it's very very
WL54IOUrUg0,714160,717160,interesting
WL54IOUrUg0,733839,739440,i saw you down the motorway there was  something about you that day
WL54IOUrUg0,739440,744480,i can still hear the shimmering sound
WL54IOUrUg0,744480,751040,the hill is near let's get right up  walk up to every top we couldn't tell
WL54IOUrUg0,751040,758079,the sky from the ground  i know my life
WL54IOUrUg0,758079,765760,never be the same after that day  you wrap me around your fingers and you
WL54IOUrUg0,765760,773120,stay  i don't ever wanna be alone
WL54IOUrUg0,774730,779709,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,780800,785839,after our time by the sea we walked back  to our airbnb and freshened up and
WL54IOUrUg0,785839,791839,changed for dinner and on our way to  dinner we stopped at this other  viewpoint called the heart of santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,791839,797680,which was absolutely gorgeous there's  tons of places to park if you want to  come visit this as well
WL54IOUrUg0,797680,803120,and we really loved it you can kind of  hike around to all these pretty  viewpoints but it was incredibly
WL54IOUrUg0,803120,811040,peaceful and awe inspiring to watch the  sunset over the sea then we went over to  theophaneus food experience which was
WL54IOUrUg0,811040,818000,such a fabulous place to enjoy a meal  they actually had live music this night  as well which really enhanced and added
WL54IOUrUg0,818000,825680,on to the atmosphere so we loved it we  got this beautiful salad it's actually  their house salad but had some special
WL54IOUrUg0,825680,832320,little touches and fruit it was divine  and we also had some grilled halloumi  cheese which is one of my favorites so
WL54IOUrUg0,832320,838880,we enjoyed that and then a beautiful  pasta dish and we ended with some  baklava which is the best baklava that
WL54IOUrUg0,838880,845519,i've ever had and this was actually  brandon's favorite meal of the trip so  that's saying something
WL54IOUrUg0,845680,851440,good morning we are off to another day  of exploring santorini
WL54IOUrUg0,851440,856560,we are dressed for hiking we are going  to be i didn't realize how much hiking
WL54IOUrUg0,856560,863360,there is on this island the terrain  definitely is built for some beautiful  hikes so our first stop is breakfast and
WL54IOUrUg0,863360,869760,then we're gonna go to a lighthouse that  looks incredible kind of on the tip of  the island and then we're gonna make our
WL54IOUrUg0,869760,876800,way over to  ancient thera and then yeah later today  so that's kind of the rundown but really
WL54IOUrUg0,876800,884160,excited b what was your favorite part of  yesterday  [Applause]  uh probably dinner dinner yeah dinner
WL54IOUrUg0,884160,891040,was so fabulous we love dinner what was  my favorite part  your favorite part oh you're gonna
WL54IOUrUg0,891040,897199,answer for me  probably  our  [Applause]
WL54IOUrUg0,897199,902240,hike in the morning and early afternoon  going through all the towns yes
WL54IOUrUg0,902240,909600,there goes pirgos here goes yes not sure  if we're pronouncing everything  correctly but all the towns have just
WL54IOUrUg0,909600,923179,been an absolute dream  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,923360,930399,for breakfast we went over to the acro  theory bistro cafe and this was another  beautiful breakfast we got some toast
WL54IOUrUg0,930399,936320,with eggs and a side of fruit and greek  yogurt which the greek yogurt i expected
WL54IOUrUg0,936320,941360,it to be even yummier here but it did  not disappoint it was so incredibly
WL54IOUrUg0,941360,948759,creamy and just fresh we absolutely  loved it and had it every single day
WL54IOUrUg0,951410,976509,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,977519,985360,after our meal we went over to the acro  terry lighthouse which is absolutely a  must do if you ask me it is sort of by
WL54IOUrUg0,985360,992480,itself on one of the tips of the islands  so you will need to drive there or take  an atv or scooter but i absolutely think
WL54IOUrUg0,992480,999120,it's worth it the views here are beyond  stunning and there was this nice food  truck where you could order some coffee
WL54IOUrUg0,999120,1004720,and food and enjoy the views and hike  around so i really think it is a must do
WL54IOUrUg0,1004720,1011839,and we probably spent an hour and a half  here just soaking in the views and we  ended up ordering some slovakia and
WL54IOUrUg0,1011839,1020210,another coffee and just sat at this cute  little bistro table cliffside looking at  all the boats going by
WL54IOUrUg0,1020210,1023419,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1028000,1036349,do  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1040730,1055959,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1056400,1063840,after our time at the lighthouse we made  our way up to ancient thera which was  such an experience so ancient thera is
WL54IOUrUg0,1063840,1070000,located on the top of mesa voonu  mountain and it's about 365 meters high
WL54IOUrUg0,1070000,1077360,so you feel like you're at the tippity  top of santorini when you make the trek  up here and for us the drive up was a
WL54IOUrUg0,1077360,1082480,bit  much i mean we totally did it brandon  did such a good job but it was very
WL54IOUrUg0,1082480,1088960,steep and maybe that is coming from two  floridians who are  used to being at sea level or below sea
WL54IOUrUg0,1088960,1096559,level with very flat roads so you are  driving up the side of this mountain and  it's very curvy and windy but the trek
WL54IOUrUg0,1096559,1103600,up was totally worth it because ancient  thera is so incredibly fascinating  because you see the ruins of this
WL54IOUrUg0,1103600,1109120,ancient civilization and it provides so  much history so when you arrive you will
WL54IOUrUg0,1109120,1116000,need to pay six euros to enter the ruins  which we do think is worth it because  there really is so much to see it's a
WL54IOUrUg0,1116000,1121039,lot more expansive than i even imagined  you're able to see cemeteries theater
WL54IOUrUg0,1121039,1126480,markets temples churches baths and  again you really can use your
WL54IOUrUg0,1126480,1131679,imagination to take in these ruins and  picture what life may have been like in
WL54IOUrUg0,1131679,1138880,these ancient times if you're enamored  by history at all this is definitely a  must visit this was actually brandon's
WL54IOUrUg0,1138880,1146000,favorite activity of the trip he could  have spent all day here i will mention  though it is quite toasty especially if
WL54IOUrUg0,1146000,1151600,you come in the summertime you are at  the top of this mountain and if there's  no clouds in the sky the sun will be
WL54IOUrUg0,1151600,1156880,beating down on you  so definitely keep that in mind bring  plenty of water and while we were there
WL54IOUrUg0,1156880,1163360,there was a food truck as well so you  are able to grab a snack and drinks so  that's definitely super convenient and
WL54IOUrUg0,1163360,1166360,appreciated
WL54IOUrUg0,1169800,1178140,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1184000,1191120,as we were leaving ancient thera we were  talking to this pastor from italy and we  saw these donkeys which it was cute
WL54IOUrUg0,1191120,1196799,because he said oh donkeys are even  better than horses because we couldn't  tell if they were donkeys or horses
WL54IOUrUg0,1196799,1202799,because we're not so familiar with them  but he said oh yeah it's a donkey and  they're better than horses because jesus
WL54IOUrUg0,1202799,1208720,came in on a donkey and i just thought  that was really cute and a fun fact  because donkeys are very prevalent on
WL54IOUrUg0,1208720,1214880,the island of santorini a donkey is  actually stronger than a horse of the  same size which is something i didn't
WL54IOUrUg0,1214880,1220640,realize but they're used often to help  carry things especially along the  mountain side
WL54IOUrUg0,1220640,1227600,then we made our way over to ia which is  where we spent our final night on the  island and this is probably the location
WL54IOUrUg0,1227600,1234080,that you daydream of when you think of  santorini it is a coastal town on the  northwestern tip of the island and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,1234080,1240720,known for those beautiful white-washed  houses that are carved into the cliff  tops and you really just have such
WL54IOUrUg0,1240720,1246080,stunning views of the caldera and the  water so this is such a beautiful town
WL54IOUrUg0,1246080,1251679,that i was so thankful to get to  experience  hello from ia i cannot believe this
WL54IOUrUg0,1251679,1257520,place is real and that it exists i'm  quite emotional to be here to be honest  it is just
WL54IOUrUg0,1257520,1265200,absolutely unreal so incredibly peaceful  and this home that we're staying in is
WL54IOUrUg0,1265200,1270960,magnificent there really is  not words to describe how beautiful it  is and
WL54IOUrUg0,1270960,1276240,cannot wait to watch the sunset later  right now we just  freshened up a little bit i put on a
WL54IOUrUg0,1276240,1281679,different top and we are gonna go  find some food find something delicious  to eat
WL54IOUrUg0,1281679,1287200,and we'll probably walk around for a bit  and then come back to the home to watch  the sunset
WL54IOUrUg0,1287200,1293679,and go out later tonight for some tapas  and live music so that's the rundown of  what we're hoping to do but brandon and
WL54IOUrUg0,1293679,1299280,i were just talking about how much we've  already done on this trip and all the  experiences we've had already and it's
WL54IOUrUg0,1299280,1306320,only been a little over a day can you  believe that so we're just  so so thankful and truly falling in love
WL54IOUrUg0,1306320,1311919,in love with this country  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1311919,1318720,here's our stunning airbnb this is one  of those airbnbs that i've had on my  wish list for many many years and it was
WL54IOUrUg0,1318720,1325039,surreal to be able to stay here and it  was great that we had the option to only  stay here one night because i feel like
WL54IOUrUg0,1325039,1330400,with some airbnbs they have a minimum  stay policy but this one allowed you to
WL54IOUrUg0,1330400,1336480,just stay one night because it is more  of a splurge so if you wanted to space  it out a bit you could but it was
WL54IOUrUg0,1336480,1342240,absolutely worth it in my opinion just  to be able to  experience ia in this way and have our
WL54IOUrUg0,1342240,1348559,own pool and the beautiful cave house  i'm just so inspired by this  architecture so i was loving every
WL54IOUrUg0,1348559,1357120,second of it  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1357120,1373650,[Applause]  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1377120,1383840,once we settled in a bit we decided to  just roam around the streets and see  what we could see i didn't realize how
WL54IOUrUg0,1383840,1391600,much shopping there was in ia there were  so many different souvenir shops and  artisans and live music it really is a
WL54IOUrUg0,1391600,1399520,bustling place and there are so many  beautiful restaurants to enjoy so we  ended up going to pito euro which was my
WL54IOUrUg0,1399520,1406480,favorite meal of the trip it was quite  simple we had these beautiful euros with  chicken salaki and it had the tzatziki
WL54IOUrUg0,1406480,1413440,fresh cut bell pepper  and i love how they put the  fried potatoes in the gyro it's so
WL54IOUrUg0,1413440,1419919,delicious and adds a nice crunch so we  had that and some pita and hummus and of
WL54IOUrUg0,1419919,1427520,course another greek salad we strolled  around a bit more and then stopped for  some gelato at lolita's which was very
WL54IOUrUg0,1427520,1432710,delicious and quite refreshing on such a  warm day
WL54IOUrUg0,1432710,1468010,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1468799,1474960,and to cap off the night we ended up  just staying at the airbnb which we  really just wanted to soak up every
WL54IOUrUg0,1474960,1480320,moment we could at the airbnb since it  was so glorious and we had our dip pool
WL54IOUrUg0,1480320,1487520,to enjoy and the balcony  there are so many places to hang out and  just soak it all in so we watched the
WL54IOUrUg0,1487520,1493039,sunset in the pool and really enjoyed it  thoroughly it was so beautiful it was so
WL54IOUrUg0,1493039,1499679,peaceful even though there's people all  around you  it just felt so so calm it smelled like
WL54IOUrUg0,1499679,1505120,incense and salt and there were people  laughing people getting engaged and
WL54IOUrUg0,1505120,1512000,people enjoying beautiful meals you  could hear the forks clicking and live  music it was truly just one of those
WL54IOUrUg0,1512000,1517760,nights that i hope to remember for the  rest of my life because  it was absolutely a dream come true and
WL54IOUrUg0,1517760,1551339,just something so heavenly  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1553620,1561480,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1562980,1566130,[Applause]
WL54IOUrUg0,1568000,1571000,okay
WL54IOUrUg0,1574140,1600880,[Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1600880,1606240,the castle of ia is an incredibly  popular sunset viewing location so if
WL54IOUrUg0,1606240,1613600,you go at sunset just expect it to be  crowded because it's definitely the  place to be but we ended up going in the
WL54IOUrUg0,1613600,1620400,morning so it was quite calm and  peaceful and the castle of ia was  actually built by the venetians and much
WL54IOUrUg0,1620400,1626640,like many of the other villages and  homes on the island the inhabitants  built their houses close to each other
WL54IOUrUg0,1626640,1633120,in hard to reach places among the cliffs  because during the middle ages there  were so many pirates that would come
WL54IOUrUg0,1633120,1638399,after these greek islands and try to  steal and they really just use this
WL54IOUrUg0,1638399,1645399,landscape as a way to protect and keep  an eye out on the water
WL54IOUrUg0,1655120,1661520,good morning from the glorious santorini  it is truly heavenly here
WL54IOUrUg0,1661520,1666880,yeah and yeah yes it's so glorious but
WL54IOUrUg0,1666880,1672000,unfortunately it's our last day in  santorini but fortunately we are heading
WL54IOUrUg0,1672000,1677120,over to milos later today  so we're going to catch a ferry in a few
WL54IOUrUg0,1677120,1682159,hours like six hours actually so we have  quite a quite a bit of time still and
WL54IOUrUg0,1682159,1688080,we're going to go to thura which is the  capital of santorini and explore  shop
WL54IOUrUg0,1688080,1694399,eat all of that good stuff and then  we'll catch our ferry but  what is your
WL54IOUrUg0,1694399,1699919,thought of santorini it's great it's  great it's great it's an understatement
WL54IOUrUg0,1699919,1706559,everywhere it's pretty  yeah seriously everywhere you from  landscapes and
WL54IOUrUg0,1706559,1712080,yeah it's like every spot of the island  is a little different which is really  neat would you say it's um worth it to
WL54IOUrUg0,1712080,1717760,rent a car  yeah yeah i think it was worth it i mean  you definitely could take buses or
WL54IOUrUg0,1717760,1723679,transportation but if you want to see  all different parts of the island having  a car is super convenient and parking is
WL54IOUrUg0,1723679,1729279,fairly easy even in popular villages  like es so yeah i was impressed like by
WL54IOUrUg0,1729279,1736480,that it's not like that back in the  states you have to pay to park  everywhere and it's hard to park yeah  it's different yeah so that was a good
WL54IOUrUg0,1736480,1743440,surprise and it's just absolutely  glorious and we're so thankful for our  time here so i'll show you what we get
WL54IOUrUg0,1743440,1752689,up to in thira  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1754480,1761679,on our way to thera we stopped in the  town of immoral vaguely which isn't far  from ia at all and it is home to the
WL54IOUrUg0,1761679,1766799,skaros rock which is such an incredible  sight to see highly recommend visiting
WL54IOUrUg0,1766799,1773279,if you have the chance it is this  incredible rock formation and it was  actually considered the most important
WL54IOUrUg0,1773279,1778480,of santorini's five castle fortresses  because the rock was actually inhabited
WL54IOUrUg0,1778480,1786559,in medieval times and due to the unique  landscape of the fortress it offered a  lot more protection from the pirates so
WL54IOUrUg0,1786559,1792880,there's another fun fact but you can  actually hike along the rock and this  whole town was also very beautiful and
WL54IOUrUg0,1792880,1799120,would be a wonderful place to stay and  for our last meal in santorini we went  to lucky's slovakias in thera and this
WL54IOUrUg0,1799120,1806320,was a great place you can dine in but it  is quite small so we just grabbed and go  and walked around a bit and also got a
WL54IOUrUg0,1806320,1813679,juice we were able to enjoy some food  and take in the sights before heading to  the port our ferry was quite delayed
WL54IOUrUg0,1813679,1820559,unfortunately as you can see the water  was quite choppy this day so there was  some weather delays so we just hung out
WL54IOUrUg0,1820559,1826320,at the port for a while which  there isn't a whole lot to do at this  port i mean since we had such long
WL54IOUrUg0,1826320,1832399,delays we could have  taken a taxi back to town but we were  already here and we weren't sure what
WL54IOUrUg0,1832399,1839520,the situation would be so we kind of  just hung out at the port for quite a  bit and got some ice cream and
WL54IOUrUg0,1839520,1845600,just tried to make the most of it but it  definitely was a long travel day to get  to milos but i'm excited to show you
WL54IOUrUg0,1845600,1857050,what we got up to there  [Music]
WL54IOUrUg0,1859840,1865360,[Music]  and that's going to be it for the  santorini vlog but thank you so much for
WL54IOUrUg0,1865360,1871039,following along  the view oh yeah i'll show you one last  time i know that's right in front of us
WL54IOUrUg0,1871039,1876320,yeah it's so gorgeous catch up with you  later once we're in milos for part two
WL54IOUrUg0,1876320,1882930,of our greece trip  [Music]
