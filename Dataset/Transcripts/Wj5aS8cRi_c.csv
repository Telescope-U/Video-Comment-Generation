Wj5aS8cRi_c,160,2560,the spacesuit is always the star of the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,2560,4720,show no matter if it's science fiction
Wj5aS8cRi_c,4720,6960,or science reality the joy and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,6960,8639,inspiration we feel when we witness
Wj5aS8cRi_c,8639,10960,astronauts in upgraded spacesuits is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,10960,13759,well known for what it is the new spacex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,13759,16800,spacesuit design is unlike anything nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,16800,20000,or anyone has ever done before spacex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,20000,22240,high-tech spacesuit boasts so many
Wj5aS8cRi_c,22240,24720,unique features such as touchscreen
Wj5aS8cRi_c,24720,27439,compatibility and dynamic heat control
Wj5aS8cRi_c,27439,29519,and others that you won't believe your
Wj5aS8cRi_c,29519,31760,eyes spacex's new suit appears to be
Wj5aS8cRi_c,31760,33520,more like something out of a sci-fi
Wj5aS8cRi_c,33520,36160,movie it's rather amazing really what
Wj5aS8cRi_c,36160,37760,distinguishes this cutting-edge
Wj5aS8cRi_c,37760,40320,spacesuit from others and what role does
Wj5aS8cRi_c,40320,42160,it play in the development of space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,42160,44719,travel nasa's first commercial crew trip
Wj5aS8cRi_c,44719,46160,and the first time astronauts have
Wj5aS8cRi_c,46160,48399,launched from american soil in almost a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,48399,51520,decade will take place on may 27th when
Wj5aS8cRi_c,51520,54160,the spacex crew dragon spacecraft flies
Wj5aS8cRi_c,54160,55760,with american astronauts for the first
Wj5aS8cRi_c,55760,57520,time since the period of the space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,57520,60160,shuttle a decade ago in comparison to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,60160,62160,the orange shuttle flight suits worn by
Wj5aS8cRi_c,62160,63600,astronauts when they launched from
Wj5aS8cRi_c,63600,65680,florida's kennedy space center and to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,65680,67520,any other spacesuits used by astronauts
Wj5aS8cRi_c,67520,69600,from other countries consistent space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,69600,71520,watchers would notice that crew 1
Wj5aS8cRi_c,71520,74240,astronauts bob banken and doug hurley
Wj5aS8cRi_c,74240,76080,were something more than the usual
Wj5aS8cRi_c,76080,78560,spacesuits white one-piece suits from
Wj5aS8cRi_c,78560,80960,spacex are a departure from the bulky
Wj5aS8cRi_c,80960,82720,space shuttle suits known as the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,82720,85680,advanced crew escape suits aces when the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,85680,88479,new spacex spacesuit design was revealed
Wj5aS8cRi_c,88479,90799,it was so slim the firm founder elon
Wj5aS8cRi_c,90799,93119,musk had to reassure worried instagram
Wj5aS8cRi_c,93119,94720,followers that it was definitely
Wj5aS8cRi_c,94720,97280,effective and it won't hurt anyone even
Wj5aS8cRi_c,97280,99920,if you just jumped into a vacuum chamber
Wj5aS8cRi_c,99920,101920,but before we get lost in the allure of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,101920,104240,this high-tech suit let's clarify what
Wj5aS8cRi_c,104240,107439,exactly spacesuits are astronauts use
Wj5aS8cRi_c,107439,110240,spacesuits also known as emus for extra
Wj5aS8cRi_c,110240,112640,vehicular mobility units to protect
Wj5aS8cRi_c,112640,114560,themselves from the harsh conditions of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,114560,117040,space including the vacuum and the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,117040,119280,severe temperatures a spacesuit is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,119280,121680,necessary for extra vehicular activity
Wj5aS8cRi_c,121680,124240,eva which is work performed outside of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,124240,126320,the spacecraft in the case of a loss of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,126320,128720,cabin pressure spacesuits have been worn
Wj5aS8cRi_c,128720,130720,and efficient in our space travels from
Wj5aS8cRi_c,130720,132480,planetary adventures at the orbiting of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,132480,134640,the earth the surface of the moon back
Wj5aS8cRi_c,134640,136879,to the return trip in order to keep the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,136879,138640,user comfortable and limit the effort
Wj5aS8cRi_c,138640,140640,required to flex their limbs modern
Wj5aS8cRi_c,140640,142720,spacesuits incorporate a complex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,142720,144239,collection of technologies and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,144239,146400,environmental systems into the basic
Wj5aS8cRi_c,146400,148239,pressure garment typically a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,148239,150080,self-contained oxygen supply and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,150080,152080,environment control system are used to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,152080,154160,offer complete independence from the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,154160,158000,spaceship ieva intra-extra vehicular
Wj5aS8cRi_c,158000,160480,activity is a type of spacesuit used for
Wj5aS8cRi_c,160480,162720,intravehicular and extra-vehicular
Wj5aS8cRi_c,162720,165200,activities being intended for use in a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,165200,168160,pressurized spacecraft iva suits are
Wj5aS8cRi_c,168160,170160,thinner and cozier than traditional
Wj5aS8cRi_c,170160,172480,space suits it is possible to utilize an
Wj5aS8cRi_c,172480,175440,ie va suit both inside and outside of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,175440,178400,the spacecraft such as the gemini g4c
Wj5aS8cRi_c,178400,180319,suit they are more able to withstand the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,180319,182640,harsh conditions of outer space such as
Wj5aS8cRi_c,182640,183840,micro
Wj5aS8cRi_c,183840,186080,and abrupt temperature changes on the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,186080,188879,other hand eva suits such as the emu
Wj5aS8cRi_c,188879,190879,which are worn outside of ships are used
Wj5aS8cRi_c,190879,193599,for spacewalks and planetary exploration
Wj5aS8cRi_c,193599,195120,there are certainly a variety of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,195120,197440,spacesuit types and designs but they're
Wj5aS8cRi_c,197440,199920,all based on the same basic concept
Wj5aS8cRi_c,199920,201840,spacex's suit on the other hand
Wj5aS8cRi_c,201840,204080,drastically alters the situation
Wj5aS8cRi_c,204080,205760,meanwhile the spacesuits currently worn
Wj5aS8cRi_c,205760,207840,by astronauts on the international space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,207840,211200,station iss are rather outdated this
Wj5aS8cRi_c,211200,212879,could be what prompted the construction
Wj5aS8cRi_c,212879,214959,of an elite spacesuit for astronauts by
Wj5aS8cRi_c,214959,218000,spacex and they of course delivered if
Wj5aS8cRi_c,218000,219519,the spacesuit appears to be something
Wj5aS8cRi_c,219519,221920,that can only be worn in movies it is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,221920,223599,definitely because it's the work of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,223599,226319,famed hollywood costume designer jose
Wj5aS8cRi_c,226319,228319,fernandez known for his work on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,228319,230480,blockbuster films like wonder woman
Wj5aS8cRi_c,230480,233360,wolverine batman vs superman and captain
Wj5aS8cRi_c,233360,236319,america civil war among others he and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,236319,238239,elon musk worked together on the design
Wj5aS8cRi_c,238239,240720,of the spacex spacesuit the first images
Wj5aS8cRi_c,240720,241920,of the suit were made public in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,241920,244720,september of 2017. a mannequin named
Wj5aS8cRi_c,244720,246799,starman after david bowie's song of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,246799,248879,their name donned a spacex spacesuit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,248879,251120,during a falcon heavy's inaugural flight
Wj5aS8cRi_c,251120,253599,in february 2018. when he was first
Wj5aS8cRi_c,253599,255439,shown off at the expo the suit had no
Wj5aS8cRi_c,255439,257840,sensors and was not pressurized the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,257840,260079,vacuum compatible suit prevents cabin
Wj5aS8cRi_c,260079,262560,depressurization via a single tether of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,262560,264639,the astronaut's thigh which supplies
Wj5aS8cRi_c,264639,267199,oxygen and electronic connections the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,267199,269360,design of spacex's spacesuits has been
Wj5aS8cRi_c,269360,271199,kept under wraps but the company has
Wj5aS8cRi_c,271199,272720,stressed that the suits is supposed to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,272720,274479,be symbiotic with the big computer
Wj5aS8cRi_c,274479,276240,panels that astronauts would use to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,276240,278560,monitor dragon systems and navigate to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,278560,280720,the international space station each
Wj5aS8cRi_c,280720,282880,astronaut suit is a one-of-a-kind
Wj5aS8cRi_c,282880,285360,creation according to nasa the spacesuit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,285360,287600,created by spacex is designed to be
Wj5aS8cRi_c,287600,289919,practical lightweight and to offer
Wj5aS8cRi_c,289919,291479,protection from probable
Wj5aS8cRi_c,291479,294400,depressurization among other features
Wj5aS8cRi_c,294400,296479,similar to the aces suits emergency
Wj5aS8cRi_c,296479,298240,breathing system and capacity to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,298240,300160,pressurize entirely in the event of a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,300160,302320,cabin loss of oxygen the suit will
Wj5aS8cRi_c,302320,304400,protect against depressurization
Wj5aS8cRi_c,304400,306400,according to the agency life support
Wj5aS8cRi_c,306400,308080,systems including air and power
Wj5aS8cRi_c,308080,310160,connections are connected to a single
Wj5aS8cRi_c,310160,312800,connection point on the suit's thigh the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,312800,315520,helmet is custom manufactured using 3d
Wj5aS8cRi_c,315520,317600,printing technology and includes
Wj5aS8cRi_c,317600,320080,integrated valves mechanisms for visor
Wj5aS8cRi_c,320080,322400,retraction and locking and microphones
Wj5aS8cRi_c,322400,324639,within the helmet structure the 3d
Wj5aS8cRi_c,324639,325919,printed helmets have built-in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,325919,328639,microphones and speakers x territorial
Wj5aS8cRi_c,328639,330479,actions are not possible with the suits
Wj5aS8cRi_c,330479,332000,because they are tethered and lack
Wj5aS8cRi_c,332000,334240,radiation protection on board the dragon
Wj5aS8cRi_c,334240,336880,2 spacecraft in 2018 astronauts bob
Wj5aS8cRi_c,336880,338479,banken and doug hurley from nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,338479,340639,commercial crew performed a series of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,340639,342400,trials to become accustomed to the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,342400,344479,spacesuit the astronauts who flew on the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,344479,346560,first crude test mission of spacex's
Wj5aS8cRi_c,346560,348639,crew dragon commented on the differences
Wj5aS8cRi_c,348639,350400,between the spacex suit and other
Wj5aS8cRi_c,350400,352479,spacesuits that astronauts have worn in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,352479,355360,the past spacex's suit significantly
Wj5aS8cRi_c,355360,357360,differs from the suit worn on shuttle
Wj5aS8cRi_c,357360,358199,missions
Wj5aS8cRi_c,358199,361360,sts-129 and sts-135
Wj5aS8cRi_c,361360,363280,according to veteran astronaut mark
Wj5aS8cRi_c,363280,365360,hurley at a pre-flight press briefing on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,365360,366560,may 1st
Wj5aS8cRi_c,366560,367840,during his brief stay at the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,367840,369600,international space station he mentioned
Wj5aS8cRi_c,369600,371520,that the so-called suit he was wearing
Wj5aS8cRi_c,371520,373440,differed from the russian counterpart
Wj5aS8cRi_c,373440,375440,but he also said that he never actually
Wj5aS8cRi_c,375440,377360,went through the suit up process because
Wj5aS8cRi_c,377360,379520,the so-called was utilized as a backup
Wj5aS8cRi_c,379520,381720,suit in case something went wrong
Wj5aS8cRi_c,381720,383600,depressurization which occurs as the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,383600,385840,spacecraft loses air is still the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,385840,388080,primary purpose of the suit as an added
Wj5aS8cRi_c,388080,389840,benefit astronauts can count on their
Wj5aS8cRi_c,389840,392160,suits to keep them well oxygenated and a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,392160,394000,comfortable body temperature all day
Wj5aS8cRi_c,394000,395919,long you can communicate and breathe
Wj5aS8cRi_c,395919,398319,through one umbilical cable attached to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,398319,401039,the seat nasa's own designs are no match
Wj5aS8cRi_c,401039,403600,for the spacesuits but spacex's rivalry
Wj5aS8cRi_c,403600,406160,must be considered not even boeing the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,406160,407680,venerable firm that has been fighting
Wj5aS8cRi_c,407680,409599,spacex for the privilege to fly nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,409599,412000,missions is beyond reach as part of its
Wj5aS8cRi_c,412000,414160,contract with nasa it has developed a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,414160,416080,pressure suit to keep passengers safe
Wj5aS8cRi_c,416080,417520,throughout the crucial launch and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,417520,421039,re-entry phases of its cst-100 starliner
Wj5aS8cRi_c,421039,423599,spacecraft for american astronauts the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,423599,426240,new boeing blue suits are about 40
Wj5aS8cRi_c,426240,428080,lighter and more flexible than earlier
Wj5aS8cRi_c,428080,430240,generations of spacesuits to prevent
Wj5aS8cRi_c,430240,432240,astronauts from overheating they have
Wj5aS8cRi_c,432240,434080,numerous layers of insulation inside
Wj5aS8cRi_c,434080,436400,their bodies using tablets while in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,436400,438160,orbit is now possible because of the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,438160,439919,addition of touch screen sensitive
Wj5aS8cRi_c,439919,442479,gloves to the gear the soft hood-like
Wj5aS8cRi_c,442479,445039,helmet has a wide polycarbonate visor to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,445039,447280,enhance starliner passengers peripheral
Wj5aS8cRi_c,447280,450319,vision as they travel to and from space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,450319,452000,zips in the torso area will make it
Wj5aS8cRi_c,452000,454080,easier for astronauts to go from sitting
Wj5aS8cRi_c,454080,456479,to standing two new suits vanessa's
Wj5aS8cRi_c,456479,458800,artemis program were unveiled in october
Wj5aS8cRi_c,458800,461599,2019 with a close-up look one of the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,461599,464000,suits is the orion crew survival system
Wj5aS8cRi_c,464000,465919,which is identical to the suits used by
Wj5aS8cRi_c,465919,468479,spacex and boeing however it is a lot
Wj5aS8cRi_c,468479,470319,lighter than the pumpkin suits that
Wj5aS8cRi_c,470319,472639,astronauts wear on the space shuttle on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,472639,475599,the other hand the x emu or exploration
Wj5aS8cRi_c,475599,477759,extra vehicular mobility unit is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,477759,479599,designed to be worn on the surface of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,479599,481440,the moon even the pressure suits that
Wj5aS8cRi_c,481440,483520,astronauts wear on spacecraft are
Wj5aS8cRi_c,483520,486000,dwarfed by it as a result it must shield
Wj5aS8cRi_c,486000,487840,the user from extreme temperature
Wj5aS8cRi_c,487840,490160,changes outside the spacecraft micro
Wj5aS8cRi_c,490160,492560,meteorites and other small space debris
Wj5aS8cRi_c,492560,495199,are likewise protected by this on these
Wj5aS8cRi_c,495199,497039,counts it is analogous to the space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,497039,498800,walking suits previously employed
Wj5aS8cRi_c,498800,500639,onboard the international space station
Wj5aS8cRi_c,500639,503120,iss there are two space walking suits
Wj5aS8cRi_c,503120,505199,used on board the international space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,505199,507599,station one is the russian orlan which
Wj5aS8cRi_c,507599,510400,was unveiled in december 1977. there is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,510400,512800,only one piece the orlan spacesuit the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,512800,514080,backpack can be opened like a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,514080,516159,refrigerator door by the spacewalker so
Wj5aS8cRi_c,516159,518959,that he or she can crawl inside the nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,518959,521440,extravehicular mobility suit emu
Wj5aS8cRi_c,521440,524320,developed in 1981 is the second suit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,524320,526720,deployed onboard the space station there
Wj5aS8cRi_c,526720,528880,are two halves to the emu a bottom half
Wj5aS8cRi_c,528880,531279,and a top half unlike the orlan the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,531279,533120,semi-rigid suit provides about eight and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,533120,535200,a half hours of life support outside in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,535200,537760,a spaces vacuum during apollo missions
Wj5aS8cRi_c,537760,540399,astronauts used a suit called the emu it
Wj5aS8cRi_c,540399,542160,was different from the current version
Wj5aS8cRi_c,542160,544320,though years of hard work had finally
Wj5aS8cRi_c,544320,546560,paid off since the first spacewalk in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,546560,549680,march 1965 by the late cosmonaut alexi
Wj5aS8cRi_c,549680,552240,leonov spacesuits have gone a long way
Wj5aS8cRi_c,552240,555040,spacex's starman suit is an heir to this
Wj5aS8cRi_c,555040,557680,line of study and invention because of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,557680,559519,the chinese advancements and their
Wj5aS8cRi_c,559519,561519,intention to challenge the united states
Wj5aS8cRi_c,561519,564240,in an all-new space race spacex appears
Wj5aS8cRi_c,564240,566640,to be keeping the suit a trade secret
Wj5aS8cRi_c,566640,568720,but it's obvious that spacex has put in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,568720,570640,a lot of work because established
Wj5aS8cRi_c,570640,572959,industry firms are still using spacesuit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,572959,575440,technologies from the cold war era
Wj5aS8cRi_c,575440,577600,spacex is setting the standards and

Wj5aS8cRi_c,6960,8639,inspiration we feel when we witness
Wj5aS8cRi_c,8639,10960,astronauts in upgraded spacesuits is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,10960,13759,well known for what it is the new spacex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,13759,16800,spacesuit design is unlike anything nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,16800,20000,or anyone has ever done before spacex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,20000,22240,high-tech spacesuit boasts so many

Wj5aS8cRi_c,27439,29519,and others that you won't believe your
Wj5aS8cRi_c,29519,31760,eyes spacex's new suit appears to be
Wj5aS8cRi_c,31760,33520,more like something out of a sci-fi
Wj5aS8cRi_c,33520,36160,movie it's rather amazing really what
Wj5aS8cRi_c,36160,37760,distinguishes this cutting-edge
Wj5aS8cRi_c,37760,40320,spacesuit from others and what role does
Wj5aS8cRi_c,40320,42160,it play in the development of space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,42160,44719,travel nasa's first commercial crew trip
Wj5aS8cRi_c,44719,46160,and the first time astronauts have

Wj5aS8cRi_c,76080,78560,spacesuits white one-piece suits from
Wj5aS8cRi_c,78560,80960,spacex are a departure from the bulky
Wj5aS8cRi_c,80960,82720,space shuttle suits known as the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,82720,85680,advanced crew escape suits aces when the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,85680,88479,new spacex spacesuit design was revealed
Wj5aS8cRi_c,88479,90799,it was so slim the firm founder elon
Wj5aS8cRi_c,90799,93119,musk had to reassure worried instagram
Wj5aS8cRi_c,93119,94720,followers that it was definitely
Wj5aS8cRi_c,94720,97280,effective and it won't hurt anyone even
Wj5aS8cRi_c,97280,99920,if you just jumped into a vacuum chamber
Wj5aS8cRi_c,99920,101920,but before we get lost in the allure of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,101920,104240,this high-tech suit let's clarify what
Wj5aS8cRi_c,104240,107439,exactly spacesuits are astronauts use
Wj5aS8cRi_c,107439,110240,spacesuits also known as emus for extra
Wj5aS8cRi_c,110240,112640,vehicular mobility units to protect
Wj5aS8cRi_c,112640,114560,themselves from the harsh conditions of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,114560,117040,space including the vacuum and the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,117040,119280,severe temperatures a spacesuit is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,119280,121680,necessary for extra vehicular activity
Wj5aS8cRi_c,121680,124240,eva which is work performed outside of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,124240,126320,the spacecraft in the case of a loss of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,126320,128720,cabin pressure spacesuits have been worn
Wj5aS8cRi_c,128720,130720,and efficient in our space travels from
Wj5aS8cRi_c,130720,132480,planetary adventures at the orbiting of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,132480,134640,the earth the surface of the moon back
Wj5aS8cRi_c,134640,136879,to the return trip in order to keep the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,136879,138640,user comfortable and limit the effort
Wj5aS8cRi_c,138640,140640,required to flex their limbs modern
Wj5aS8cRi_c,140640,142720,spacesuits incorporate a complex
Wj5aS8cRi_c,142720,144239,collection of technologies and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,144239,146400,environmental systems into the basic

Wj5aS8cRi_c,150080,152080,environment control system are used to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,152080,154160,offer complete independence from the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,154160,158000,spaceship ieva intra-extra vehicular
Wj5aS8cRi_c,158000,160480,activity is a type of spacesuit used for
Wj5aS8cRi_c,160480,162720,intravehicular and extra-vehicular
Wj5aS8cRi_c,162720,165200,activities being intended for use in a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,165200,168160,pressurized spacecraft iva suits are
Wj5aS8cRi_c,168160,170160,thinner and cozier than traditional
Wj5aS8cRi_c,170160,172480,space suits it is possible to utilize an
Wj5aS8cRi_c,172480,175440,ie va suit both inside and outside of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,175440,178400,the spacecraft such as the gemini g4c
Wj5aS8cRi_c,178400,180319,suit they are more able to withstand the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,180319,182640,harsh conditions of outer space such as
Wj5aS8cRi_c,182640,183840,micro
Wj5aS8cRi_c,183840,186080,and abrupt temperature changes on the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,186080,188879,other hand eva suits such as the emu
Wj5aS8cRi_c,188879,190879,which are worn outside of ships are used
Wj5aS8cRi_c,190879,193599,for spacewalks and planetary exploration
Wj5aS8cRi_c,193599,195120,there are certainly a variety of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,195120,197440,spacesuit types and designs but they're
Wj5aS8cRi_c,197440,199920,all based on the same basic concept
Wj5aS8cRi_c,199920,201840,spacex's suit on the other hand
Wj5aS8cRi_c,201840,204080,drastically alters the situation
Wj5aS8cRi_c,204080,205760,meanwhile the spacesuits currently worn
Wj5aS8cRi_c,205760,207840,by astronauts on the international space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,207840,211200,station iss are rather outdated this
Wj5aS8cRi_c,211200,212879,could be what prompted the construction
Wj5aS8cRi_c,212879,214959,of an elite spacesuit for astronauts by
Wj5aS8cRi_c,214959,218000,spacex and they of course delivered if
Wj5aS8cRi_c,218000,219519,the spacesuit appears to be something
Wj5aS8cRi_c,219519,221920,that can only be worn in movies it is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,221920,223599,definitely because it's the work of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,223599,226319,famed hollywood costume designer jose
Wj5aS8cRi_c,226319,228319,fernandez known for his work on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,228319,230480,blockbuster films like wonder woman
Wj5aS8cRi_c,230480,233360,wolverine batman vs superman and captain
Wj5aS8cRi_c,233360,236319,america civil war among others he and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,236319,238239,elon musk worked together on the design
Wj5aS8cRi_c,238239,240720,of the spacex spacesuit the first images
Wj5aS8cRi_c,240720,241920,of the suit were made public in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,241920,244720,september of 2017. a mannequin named
Wj5aS8cRi_c,244720,246799,starman after david bowie's song of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,246799,248879,their name donned a spacex spacesuit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,248879,251120,during a falcon heavy's inaugural flight
Wj5aS8cRi_c,251120,253599,in february 2018. when he was first
Wj5aS8cRi_c,253599,255439,shown off at the expo the suit had no
Wj5aS8cRi_c,255439,257840,sensors and was not pressurized the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,257840,260079,vacuum compatible suit prevents cabin
Wj5aS8cRi_c,260079,262560,depressurization via a single tether of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,262560,264639,the astronaut's thigh which supplies
Wj5aS8cRi_c,264639,267199,oxygen and electronic connections the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,267199,269360,design of spacex's spacesuits has been
Wj5aS8cRi_c,269360,271199,kept under wraps but the company has
Wj5aS8cRi_c,271199,272720,stressed that the suits is supposed to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,272720,274479,be symbiotic with the big computer
Wj5aS8cRi_c,274479,276240,panels that astronauts would use to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,276240,278560,monitor dragon systems and navigate to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,278560,280720,the international space station each
Wj5aS8cRi_c,280720,282880,astronaut suit is a one-of-a-kind
Wj5aS8cRi_c,282880,285360,creation according to nasa the spacesuit
Wj5aS8cRi_c,285360,287600,created by spacex is designed to be
Wj5aS8cRi_c,287600,289919,practical lightweight and to offer
Wj5aS8cRi_c,289919,291479,protection from probable
Wj5aS8cRi_c,291479,294400,depressurization among other features
Wj5aS8cRi_c,294400,296479,similar to the aces suits emergency
Wj5aS8cRi_c,296479,298240,breathing system and capacity to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,298240,300160,pressurize entirely in the event of a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,300160,302320,cabin loss of oxygen the suit will
Wj5aS8cRi_c,302320,304400,protect against depressurization
Wj5aS8cRi_c,304400,306400,according to the agency life support
Wj5aS8cRi_c,306400,308080,systems including air and power
Wj5aS8cRi_c,308080,310160,connections are connected to a single
Wj5aS8cRi_c,310160,312800,connection point on the suit's thigh the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,312800,315520,helmet is custom manufactured using 3d
Wj5aS8cRi_c,315520,317600,printing technology and includes
Wj5aS8cRi_c,317600,320080,integrated valves mechanisms for visor
Wj5aS8cRi_c,320080,322400,retraction and locking and microphones
Wj5aS8cRi_c,322400,324639,within the helmet structure the 3d
Wj5aS8cRi_c,324639,325919,printed helmets have built-in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,325919,328639,microphones and speakers x territorial
Wj5aS8cRi_c,328639,330479,actions are not possible with the suits
Wj5aS8cRi_c,330479,332000,because they are tethered and lack
Wj5aS8cRi_c,332000,334240,radiation protection on board the dragon
Wj5aS8cRi_c,334240,336880,2 spacecraft in 2018 astronauts bob
Wj5aS8cRi_c,336880,338479,banken and doug hurley from nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,338479,340639,commercial crew performed a series of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,340639,342400,trials to become accustomed to the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,342400,344479,spacesuit the astronauts who flew on the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,344479,346560,first crude test mission of spacex's
Wj5aS8cRi_c,346560,348639,crew dragon commented on the differences
Wj5aS8cRi_c,348639,350400,between the spacex suit and other
Wj5aS8cRi_c,350400,352479,spacesuits that astronauts have worn in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,352479,355360,the past spacex's suit significantly
Wj5aS8cRi_c,355360,357360,differs from the suit worn on shuttle
Wj5aS8cRi_c,357360,358199,missions
Wj5aS8cRi_c,358199,361360,sts-129 and sts-135
Wj5aS8cRi_c,361360,363280,according to veteran astronaut mark
Wj5aS8cRi_c,363280,365360,hurley at a pre-flight press briefing on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,365360,366560,may 1st
Wj5aS8cRi_c,366560,367840,during his brief stay at the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,367840,369600,international space station he mentioned
Wj5aS8cRi_c,369600,371520,that the so-called suit he was wearing
Wj5aS8cRi_c,371520,373440,differed from the russian counterpart
Wj5aS8cRi_c,373440,375440,but he also said that he never actually
Wj5aS8cRi_c,375440,377360,went through the suit up process because
Wj5aS8cRi_c,377360,379520,the so-called was utilized as a backup
Wj5aS8cRi_c,379520,381720,suit in case something went wrong
Wj5aS8cRi_c,381720,383600,depressurization which occurs as the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,383600,385840,spacecraft loses air is still the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,385840,388080,primary purpose of the suit as an added
Wj5aS8cRi_c,388080,389840,benefit astronauts can count on their
Wj5aS8cRi_c,389840,392160,suits to keep them well oxygenated and a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,392160,394000,comfortable body temperature all day
Wj5aS8cRi_c,394000,395919,long you can communicate and breathe
Wj5aS8cRi_c,395919,398319,through one umbilical cable attached to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,398319,401039,the seat nasa's own designs are no match
Wj5aS8cRi_c,401039,403600,for the spacesuits but spacex's rivalry
Wj5aS8cRi_c,403600,406160,must be considered not even boeing the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,406160,407680,venerable firm that has been fighting
Wj5aS8cRi_c,407680,409599,spacex for the privilege to fly nasa
Wj5aS8cRi_c,409599,412000,missions is beyond reach as part of its
Wj5aS8cRi_c,412000,414160,contract with nasa it has developed a
Wj5aS8cRi_c,414160,416080,pressure suit to keep passengers safe
Wj5aS8cRi_c,416080,417520,throughout the crucial launch and
Wj5aS8cRi_c,417520,421039,re-entry phases of its cst-100 starliner
Wj5aS8cRi_c,421039,423599,spacecraft for american astronauts the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,423599,426240,new boeing blue suits are about 40
Wj5aS8cRi_c,426240,428080,lighter and more flexible than earlier
Wj5aS8cRi_c,428080,430240,generations of spacesuits to prevent
Wj5aS8cRi_c,430240,432240,astronauts from overheating they have
Wj5aS8cRi_c,432240,434080,numerous layers of insulation inside
Wj5aS8cRi_c,434080,436400,their bodies using tablets while in
Wj5aS8cRi_c,436400,438160,orbit is now possible because of the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,438160,439919,addition of touch screen sensitive
Wj5aS8cRi_c,439919,442479,gloves to the gear the soft hood-like
Wj5aS8cRi_c,442479,445039,helmet has a wide polycarbonate visor to
Wj5aS8cRi_c,445039,447280,enhance starliner passengers peripheral
Wj5aS8cRi_c,447280,450319,vision as they travel to and from space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,450319,452000,zips in the torso area will make it
Wj5aS8cRi_c,452000,454080,easier for astronauts to go from sitting
Wj5aS8cRi_c,454080,456479,to standing two new suits vanessa's
Wj5aS8cRi_c,456479,458800,artemis program were unveiled in october
Wj5aS8cRi_c,458800,461599,2019 with a close-up look one of the
Wj5aS8cRi_c,461599,464000,suits is the orion crew survival system
Wj5aS8cRi_c,464000,465919,which is identical to the suits used by
Wj5aS8cRi_c,465919,468479,spacex and boeing however it is a lot
Wj5aS8cRi_c,468479,470319,lighter than the pumpkin suits that
Wj5aS8cRi_c,470319,472639,astronauts wear on the space shuttle on
Wj5aS8cRi_c,472639,475599,the other hand the x emu or exploration
Wj5aS8cRi_c,475599,477759,extra vehicular mobility unit is
Wj5aS8cRi_c,477759,479599,designed to be worn on the surface of
Wj5aS8cRi_c,479599,481440,the moon even the pressure suits that
Wj5aS8cRi_c,481440,483520,astronauts wear on spacecraft are
Wj5aS8cRi_c,483520,486000,dwarfed by it as a result it must shield
Wj5aS8cRi_c,486000,487840,the user from extreme temperature
Wj5aS8cRi_c,487840,490160,changes outside the spacecraft micro
Wj5aS8cRi_c,490160,492560,meteorites and other small space debris
Wj5aS8cRi_c,492560,495199,are likewise protected by this on these
Wj5aS8cRi_c,495199,497039,counts it is analogous to the space
Wj5aS8cRi_c,497039,498800,walking suits previously employed
