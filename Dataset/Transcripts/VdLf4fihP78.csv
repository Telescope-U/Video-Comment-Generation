VdLf4fihP78,73590,75540,clothing is trendy than ever and this is
VdLf4fihP78,75540,77220,largely thanks to the rise of so-called
VdLf4fihP78,77220,79140,fast-fashion retailers that produce
VdLf4fihP78,79140,81420,stylish incredibly low cost clothing
VdLf4fihP78,81420,85350,like H&M Zara and forever 21 the brand
VdLf4fihP78,85350,87299,that enables Midwestern tweens to dress
VdLf4fihP78,87299,89280,like 40 something alcoholics attending
VdLf4fihP78,89280,90630,the funeral over Tel Aviv nightclub
VdLf4fihP78,90630,91729,owner
VdLf4fihP78,91729,96060,it's a powerful look and a big part of
VdLf4fihP78,96060,97799,all these brands appeal is that there's
VdLf4fihP78,97799,99869,always something new to buy just look at
VdLf4fihP78,99869,102899,H&M s rate of turnover stores are
VdLf4fihP78,102899,105329,replenished daily from the streets to
VdLf4fihP78,105329,107850,the runway the latest trends are scoured
VdLf4fihP78,107850,111310,and can go from a sketch to the rack in
VdLf4fihP78,111310,113439,little as three weeks we have new
VdLf4fihP78,113439,115689,garments coming into the stores almost
VdLf4fihP78,115689,117549,every day so if you go to an H&M store
VdLf4fihP78,117549,119439,today and come back to this later you
VdLf4fihP78,119439,123009,will always find something new yes one
VdLf4fihP78,123009,124570,day maybe you will find a shirt and it
VdLf4fihP78,124570,126430,shares rising swag
VdLf4fihP78,126430,128380,maybe next day you'll find shirt with
VdLf4fihP78,128380,131319,pardon my swag and make me next day
VdLf4fihP78,131319,133030,after that you find cocaine dusted copy
VdLf4fihP78,133030,134650,of nylon magazine in a fitting room
VdLf4fihP78,134650,139989,something new at H&M always always a to
VdLf4fihP78,139989,142599,those prices are so competitive that a
VdLf4fihP78,142599,144549,few years back they put out a dress that
VdLf4fihP78,144549,149110,cost just $4.95 think about that that
VdLf4fihP78,149110,150610,means you could take a five dollar bill
VdLf4fihP78,150610,153430,scotch tape it over your genitals and
VdLf4fihP78,153430,155380,you'd be wearing a more expensive piece
VdLf4fihP78,155380,158860,of clothing I went online and a jar of
VdLf4fihP78,158860,162580,crickets food costs $5 a bunch of weird
VdLf4fihP78,162580,165190,orange cubes you feed to a bug a worth
VdLf4fihP78,165190,167709,five cents more than this dress that
VdLf4fihP78,167709,170349,dress is only seven cents more than a
VdLf4fihP78,170349,173519,DVD of the ghosts of Girlfriends Past
VdLf4fihP78,173519,178440,inexpensive DVD raves variety and yes
VdLf4fihP78,178440,181420,some how fast fashion companies are
VdLf4fihP78,181420,183850,massively profitable the chairman of H&M
VdLf4fihP78,183850,186700,is the 28th richest person in the world
VdLf4fihP78,186700,189640,and the co-founder of Zara is the fourth
VdLf4fihP78,189640,191680,richest person in the world that means
VdLf4fihP78,191680,194410,people who own oil fields are worth less
VdLf4fihP78,194410,196720,than a guy who makes distressed jean
VdLf4fihP78,196720,200319,shorts buying clothes is cheaper and
VdLf4fihP78,200319,202299,easier than ever and not just at fast
VdLf4fihP78,202299,204340,fashion companies traditional retailers
VdLf4fihP78,204340,206440,have lowered their prices as well which
VdLf4fihP78,206440,208660,means the only way brands make money is
VdLf4fihP78,208660,210220,through volume and that's why even
VdLf4fihP78,210220,213069,basics like jeans now go through fashion
VdLf4fihP78,213069,215340,cycles with the lifespan of mayflies
VdLf4fihP78,215340,217420,obviously the big trend is skinny jeans
VdLf4fihP78,217420,219910,so for spring forget about the skinny
VdLf4fihP78,219910,222030,jean now it's all about the flare Jean
VdLf4fihP78,222030,225160,jeans are the big thing for spring Jonah
VdLf4fihP78,225160,227050,is wearing the it Jean of the season
VdLf4fihP78,227050,229090,and that is the baggy jeans she's
VdLf4fihP78,229090,230920,marrying these two trends that have been
VdLf4fihP78,230920,232930,so controversial the culotte and the
VdLf4fihP78,232930,236740,denim we got a denim culottes denim
VdLf4fihP78,236740,240400,culottes finally an answer to the
VdLf4fihP78,240400,242620,question what if an 18th century cabin
VdLf4fihP78,242620,247960,boy was also Canadian as great as all
VdLf4fihP78,247960,250690,these stylish cheap clothes are at a
VdLf4fihP78,250690,252340,certain point it's hard not to look at
VdLf4fihP78,252340,254380,those prices and wonder how does any
VdLf4fihP78,254380,256900,clothing company make money although
VdLf4fihP78,256900,259540,let's be honest you know the answer to
VdLf4fihP78,259540,261489,that half of our clothing used to be
VdLf4fihP78,261489,263200,made in the United States as recently as
VdLf4fihP78,263200,266110,1990 it's remarkable and today 2% 2%
VdLf4fihP78,266110,267760,percent of the clothes we wear are made
VdLf4fihP78,267760,269920,here that's right we produce clothes
VdLf4fihP78,269920,272230,almost entirely overseas where it's much
VdLf4fihP78,272230,274870,cheaper and if 98% of your products
VdLf4fihP78,274870,276640,could be made abroad you should really
VdLf4fihP78,276640,278800,start changing your name to reflect that
VdLf4fihP78,278800,280990,fact so American Eagle should really
VdLf4fihP78,280990,284920,become Bangladeshi swan pen and Banana
VdLf4fihP78,284920,287380,Republic should really become actually
VdLf4fihP78,287380,290350,that one is fine they they got ahead of
VdLf4fihP78,290350,294310,themselves there for once and and look I
VdLf4fihP78,294310,296620,know you think you've heard this story
VdLf4fihP78,296620,299320,before because you have if you remember
VdLf4fihP78,299320,301720,in the 1990s sweatshops were a key point
VdLf4fihP78,301720,304180,of outrage companies like GAAP and Nike
VdLf4fihP78,304180,305980,were protested and then of course most
VdLf4fihP78,305980,308740,famously there was this Kathie Lee
VdLf4fihP78,308740,310419,Gifford said she was shocked to learn
VdLf4fihP78,310419,312190,that a clothing line bearing her name
VdLf4fihP78,312190,314770,was manufactured at least in part in
VdLf4fihP78,314770,318340,sweatshops and by underage workers yes
VdLf4fihP78,318340,320169,Kathie Lee's clothing line was caught
VdLf4fihP78,320169,321790,using child labor which was surprising
VdLf4fihP78,321790,324160,given how kindly she'd always treated
VdLf4fihP78,324160,326260,the small elderly boy who co-hosted her
VdLf4fihP78,326260,330760,show and the outcry over sweatshops
VdLf4fihP78,330760,332590,wasn't just loud it got some results
VdLf4fihP78,332590,335080,Kathie Lee even testified in front of
VdLf4fihP78,335080,337780,Congress we are now morally compelled to
VdLf4fihP78,337780,340180,ask each of us what can we do to protect
VdLf4fihP78,340180,342160,labor rights in factories around the
VdLf4fihP78,342160,344440,world and right here in America and
VdLf4fihP78,344440,346720,given that it was my own neglect that
VdLf4fihP78,346720,348370,compelled us to ask this important moral
VdLf4fihP78,348370,350080,question I say to you all you are
VdLf4fihP78,350080,352450,welcome now let's start day drinking
VdLf4fihP78,352450,354250,come on what's wrong with you people
VdLf4fihP78,354250,354930,it's
VdLf4fihP78,354930,360229,9:00 a.m. Cheers
VdLf4fihP78,360229,364410,good morning but amazingly and I know
VdLf4fihP78,364410,366870,this is hard to hear Kathy Lee did not
VdLf4fihP78,366870,369930,solve everything in fact there has been
VdLf4fihP78,369930,371789,a pattern of troubling behavior in the
VdLf4fihP78,371789,373320,garment industry for the past 20 years
VdLf4fihP78,373320,376410,just look at Gap the nation's number one
VdLf4fihP78,376410,378600,supplier of polo shirts for frat guys to
VdLf4fihP78,378600,381870,vomit on back in the 90s they were
VdLf4fihP78,381870,383850,criticized for labor abuses of a factory
VdLf4fihP78,383850,385740,making their clothes in El Salvador in
VdLf4fihP78,385740,387449,response they agreed to start an
VdLf4fihP78,387449,389550,independent monitoring program which
VdLf4fihP78,389550,390720,certainly pretty good to everyone
VdLf4fihP78,390720,393210,besides they had that fun ad where
VdLf4fihP78,393210,395849,idiots in ill-fitting khakis swing dance
VdLf4fihP78,395849,399180,so we kind of forgot all about it until
VdLf4fihP78,399180,402360,five years later when the BBC visited a
VdLf4fihP78,402360,404460,factory making Gap clothing in Cambodia
VdLf4fihP78,404460,406770,we've been told there were some children
VdLf4fihP78,406770,409650,here making clothes for the gap this is
VdLf4fihP78,409650,411169,son Teeter
VdLf4fihP78,411169,414990,she's 12 years old she told the factory
VdLf4fihP78,414990,418710,she's 18 this is chance eater she's 14
VdLf4fihP78,418710,421680,she too lied to get the job monitors
VdLf4fihP78,421680,424320,never questioned either of them oh come
VdLf4fihP78,424320,427020,on that is no excuse if a child gained
VdLf4fihP78,427020,429449,entry to a bar using a Pinkberry punch
VdLf4fihP78,429449,432150,card as a fake ID it's the bars
VdLf4fihP78,432150,434970,fault oh it says here your middle name
VdLf4fihP78,434970,437130,is one free topping cool middle name
VdLf4fihP78,437130,440400,have fun in there in response gap
VdLf4fihP78,440400,442260,revoked approval of that factory and
VdLf4fihP78,442260,443430,enhanced their age verification
VdLf4fihP78,443430,445800,requirements which sounded pretty good
VdLf4fihP78,445800,448409,besides it was the year 2000 and they
VdLf4fihP78,448409,451020,had that ad campaign wear pastel morons
VdLf4fihP78,451020,453870,did the man bold so we kind of forgot
VdLf4fihP78,453870,457080,all about it again until 7 years after
VdLf4fihP78,457080,459750,that when a British newspaper visited a
VdLf4fihP78,459750,462000,workshop in India according to a
VdLf4fihP78,462000,464400,published report these children aged 10
VdLf4fihP78,464400,467280,to 13 were working as virtual slaves
VdLf4fihP78,467280,469530,stitching embroidered shirts for Gap
VdLf4fihP78,469530,471240,Kids okay
VdLf4fihP78,471240,473820,stop having children make clothes for
VdLf4fihP78,473820,475830,gap is bad enough having them make
VdLf4fihP78,475830,478800,clothes for Gap Kids is somehow worse
VdLf4fihP78,478800,481440,make a beautiful shirt that's exactly
VdLf4fihP78,481440,483210,your size we'll ship it around the world
VdLf4fihP78,483210,485039,will be worn once and thrown away now
VdLf4fihP78,485039,486460,make a thousand more
VdLf4fihP78,486460,489550,for me in response GAAP said it didn't
VdLf4fihP78,489550,491050,know it's clothes were in that workshop
VdLf4fihP78,491050,492580,and demanded its supplier make
VdLf4fihP78,492580,494289,significant improvements to its
VdLf4fihP78,494289,496569,oversight of subcontractors and everyone
VdLf4fihP78,496569,498720,felt better especially because it was
VdLf4fihP78,498720,502169,2007 and gap had just had that
VdLf4fihP78,502169,505090,mind-blowingly cool holiday in your hood
VdLf4fihP78,505090,507880,campaign with common fell into the gap
VdLf4fihP78,507880,509919,day back in the hood seen peace in the
VdLf4fihP78,509919,517599,streets when I look I know we're talking
VdLf4fihP78,517599,519610,about child labor but that may be the
VdLf4fihP78,519610,523779,saddest that I felt so far then in 2010
VdLf4fihP78,523779,525730,a fire broke out at a factory in
VdLf4fihP78,525730,527260,Bangladesh that produced Gap clothing
VdLf4fihP78,527260,530620,killing 29 workers after that gap
VdLf4fihP78,530620,532480,launched a building and fire safety plan
VdLf4fihP78,532480,534310,which was great because it meant nothing
VdLf4fihP78,534310,536649,alarming concerning gaps presence in
VdLf4fihP78,536649,538750,Bangladesh was ever going to happen
VdLf4fihP78,538750,543339,again until 2013 when Al Jazeera found
VdLf4fihP78,543339,545950,this there's no fire extinguisher no
VdLf4fihP78,545950,548200,fire exit it's just a Shack in someone's
VdLf4fihP78,548200,551310,backyard how old
VdLf4fihP78,551330,553510,how long have you been working here
VdLf4fihP78,553510,560700,[Music]
VdLf4fihP78,562980,569260,luckily Journal says Old Navy old Navy
VdLf4fihP78,569260,573400,is owned by Gap Inc yeah I guess at this
VdLf4fihP78,573400,575320,point it seems sweatshops aren't one of
VdLf4fihP78,575320,577240,those 90s problems we got rid of like
VdLf4fihP78,577240,579850,Donnie Wahlberg they're more like one of
VdLf4fihP78,579850,581560,those 90s problems were still very much
VdLf4fihP78,581560,583600,dealing with like Mark Wahlberg
VdLf4fihP78,583600,587589,now gap says those Old Navy jeans were
VdLf4fihP78,587589,589330,rejected products sold without their
VdLf4fihP78,589330,590860,knowledge and never ended up in their
VdLf4fihP78,590860,593650,stores look all brands in the industry
VdLf4fihP78,593650,595839,have problems gap is by no means the
VdLf4fihP78,595839,597970,worst and if you ask gap as we did
VdLf4fihP78,597970,599410,they'll point out they've made real
VdLf4fihP78,599410,601420,improvements and tried as hard as they
VdLf4fihP78,601420,604000,can to fix all this but think about that
VdLf4fihP78,604000,606700,that means a company trying as hard as
VdLf4fihP78,606700,608830,it can has been not infrequently
VdLf4fihP78,608830,610839,connected to labor violations in
VdLf4fihP78,610839,613779,multiple countries over two decades and
VdLf4fihP78,613779,615670,when you weigh all this up it seems the
VdLf4fihP78,615670,618130,only situation in which gap could claim
VdLf4fihP78,618130,621010,to be unambiguously helpful to people is
VdLf4fihP78,621010,623320,when someone shits their pants directly
VdLf4fihP78,623320,625930,outside one of their stores I never
VdLf4fihP78,625930,627880,thought I'd say this but thank God gap
VdLf4fihP78,627880,631589,is here to help you people are angels
VdLf4fihP78,631589,634959,and one of the biggest problems with
VdLf4fihP78,634959,636940,holding many brands accountable is that
VdLf4fihP78,636940,639760,deniability seems to being stitched into
VdLf4fihP78,639760,642160,the supply chain look at Walmart they
VdLf4fihP78,642160,644860,insist they hold their suppliers to high
VdLf4fihP78,644860,647110,safety standards but CPS visited a
VdLf4fihP78,647110,649120,factory in Bangladesh making clothes for
VdLf4fihP78,649120,651880,Walmart and found otherwise the boss at
VdLf4fihP78,651880,654520,Mondi apparel's masa del hoc Chowdhury
VdLf4fihP78,654520,657310,showed us an evacuation map marking the
VdLf4fihP78,657310,661570,location of 13 fire extinguishers but
VdLf4fihP78,661570,665320,nearly all of them were missing well if
VdLf4fihP78,665320,667870,they're not there then that's not a map
VdLf4fihP78,667870,670000,it's an aspirational poster for fire
VdLf4fihP78,670000,672080,safety
VdLf4fihP78,672080,675830,but if that Factory does not conform to
VdLf4fihP78,675830,678230,Walmart safety standards how were their
VdLf4fihP78,678230,680750,clothes there the managers told us the
VdLf4fihP78,680750,682850,factory hasn't been approved by Walmart
VdLf4fihP78,682850,685160,for production but they still had an
VdLf4fihP78,685160,688060,order for a million Walmart boxer shorts
VdLf4fihP78,688060,690950,subcontracted to them by another Factory
VdLf4fihP78,690950,693890,I see so Walmart sent it to an approved
VdLf4fihP78,693890,696350,Factory and that factory sent it to an
VdLf4fihP78,696350,698510,unapproved factory without Walmart's
VdLf4fihP78,698510,699970,knowledge it's just a crazy
VdLf4fihP78,699970,701180,one-in-a-million
VdLf4fihP78,701180,703700,random accident that only happened
VdLf4fihP78,703700,706100,multiple times over the past few years
VdLf4fihP78,706100,708410,Walmart's say their clothing suppliers
VdLf4fihP78,708410,710690,in Bangladesh were doing business with
VdLf4fihP78,710690,712700,the factory without their knowledge one
VdLf4fihP78,712700,715160,of its suppliers subcontracted part of
VdLf4fihP78,715160,717470,the order to tessarin without their
VdLf4fihP78,717470,719480,permission the order was placed with a
VdLf4fihP78,719480,720950,troubled factory without its knowledge
VdLf4fihP78,720950,722990,it had no idea of production ever
VdLf4fihP78,722990,725180,happened there and this is not the first
VdLf4fihP78,725180,728029,time Walmart has been caught unaware no
VdLf4fihP78,728029,730370,it's not and they are losing the right
VdLf4fihP78,730370,731570,to act surprised
VdLf4fihP78,731570,732709,they're like the characters in The
VdLf4fihP78,732709,734870,Hangover movies it's it's not an
VdLf4fihP78,734870,737450,accident the third time boys it's a
VdLf4fihP78,737450,739190,pattern of reckless behavior which has
VdLf4fihP78,739190,748670,to be addressed and look since the 90s
VdLf4fihP78,748670,750350,we've sporadically cared about this
VdLf4fihP78,750350,752480,including two years ago this week after
VdLf4fihP78,752480,755089,the Rana Plaza building collapse five
VdLf4fihP78,755089,757100,days after that deadly building collapse
VdLf4fihP78,757100,759380,in Bangladesh rescuers continue to pull
VdLf4fihP78,759380,761779,survivors from the rubble new pictures
VdLf4fihP78,761779,763790,overnight show dramatic rescue some
VdLf4fihP78,763790,765829,using their bare hands to free those who
VdLf4fihP78,765829,768890,are still trapped at least 360 people
VdLf4fihP78,768890,771500,have been killed hundreds more still
VdLf4fihP78,771500,773870,missing that building collapse ended up
VdLf4fihP78,773870,776870,"killing more than 1,100 people everyone"
VdLf4fihP78,776870,778790,was justifiably horrified and that
VdLf4fihP78,778790,780440,report aired on The Today Show so you
VdLf4fihP78,780440,782810,know that everyone there heard it we
VdLf4fihP78,782810,784339,then found out that brands like Joe
VdLf4fihP78,784339,786709,Fresh and The Children's Place had been
VdLf4fihP78,786709,788690,made in Rana Plaza and we were horrified
VdLf4fihP78,788690,791149,again and yet we get so blinded by low
VdLf4fihP78,791149,793640,prices that just a few months later The
VdLf4fihP78,793640,796040,Today Show was doing this this adorable
VdLf4fihP78,796040,797570,sequined bag is from the children's
VdLf4fihP78,797570,800940,place I found it for under $10 Wow
VdLf4fihP78,800940,802110,want to spend a ton of money cuz you're
VdLf4fihP78,802110,804270,gonna spill something on it I found this
VdLf4fihP78,804270,806670,one which is a silk poly blend from Joe
VdLf4fihP78,806670,814200,fresh touch it 119 bucks get out get out
VdLf4fihP78,814200,817320,get the felt of the studio and think
VdLf4fihP78,817320,819210,about what you're doing because one of
VdLf4fihP78,819210,821400,the ladies cooing over that $19 Joe
VdLf4fihP78,821400,824010,fresh blouse is Kathie Lee Gifford and
VdLf4fihP78,824010,826560,if she can forget the human cost of
VdLf4fihP78,826560,828690,shockingly cheap clothing then that is
VdLf4fihP78,828690,830550,not in that case actually that's
VdLf4fihP78,830550,832290,surprising her brain is basically
VdLf4fihP78,832290,834540,pickled in Chardonnay at this point but
VdLf4fihP78,834540,836820,it doesn't give you much hope for
VdLf4fihP78,836820,839070,everyone else look this is going to keep
VdLf4fihP78,839070,841500,happening as long as we let it so we
VdLf4fihP78,841500,843360,need to show clothing brands not just
VdLf4fihP78,843360,846060,that we care but why they should so we
VdLf4fihP78,846060,847770,have a little surprise for the leaders
VdLf4fihP78,847770,849360,of some of these companies I'm talking
VdLf4fihP78,849360,851520,specifically about the heads of hmm of

VdLf4fihP78,868080,870570,else to get the most food they could for
VdLf4fihP78,870570,872580,the cheapest price and and they did that
VdLf4fihP78,872580,874620,now I do have strict policies in place I
VdLf4fihP78,874620,877170,told them not to spit on that food or to
VdLf4fihP78,877170,879630,rub their balls on that food and I've
VdLf4fihP78,879630,881310,trusted them to abide by that so I want
