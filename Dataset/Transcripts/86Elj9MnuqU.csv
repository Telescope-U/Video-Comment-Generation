86Elj9MnuqU,90000,100000,But there are times where you don't want/need such a bulky/heavy stand.

86Elj9MnuqU,109000,113000,It's almost the size of a credit card & is very nice.

86Elj9MnuqU,122000,128000,I'll show it to you. You get a 3mm sticker & you just have to take it out & stick it to the back of your phone.
86Elj9MnuqU,129000,135000,And this one is a 24Ã—7 air stand. Just pull it down & that's it!

86Elj9MnuqU,152000,156000,It looks beautiful & it also looks like an accessory.
86Elj9MnuqU,157000,164000,People will ask what it is. So that's nice & I'm sure you'll like it just like I did.
86Elj9MnuqU,165000,180000,Now it happens a lot with me that I get hot coffee & I forget to drink it & it gets cold after a while.
86Elj9MnuqU,181000,184000,And I hate it when I drink it & so for that purpose I have this bottle with me.
86Elj9MnuqU,185000,189000,And you're getting a great deal at Rs 500.
86Elj9MnuqU,190000,196000,It's a 500ml bottle that shows the temperature of its liquid content.
86Elj9MnuqU,197000,200000,And it is absolutely beautifully built.
86Elj9MnuqU,201000,209000,"There's metal inside, holds 500ml of liquid & the temperature is displayed above."
86Elj9MnuqU,210000,214000,It's stunning! And you just have to tap on top for the temperature to show.
86Elj9MnuqU,215000,217000,Let's fill water & check its temperature.
86Elj9MnuqU,219000,224000,Let's look at the next product & we'll check the temperature after 3-4 mins.
86Elj9MnuqU,225000,239000,"But if you're an outdoors person, then you should have this while trekking/hiking."
86Elj9MnuqU,240000,243000,This product should always be with you.
86Elj9MnuqU,244000,247000,The products under Rs 500 are so good nowadays.
86Elj9MnuqU,248000,255000,This torch is USB powered. and you can recharge it.
86Elj9MnuqU,256000,259000,It's an LED torch & there are 2-3 advantages for which I'm recommending it.
86Elj9MnuqU,260000,272000,There are 2-3 light variations/modes but if you want to search for something in the distance then you can change its focal length.
86Elj9MnuqU,273000,285000,"eg) look at this, the light has spread around but now I can make it small to focus."
86Elj9MnuqU,287000,291000,So there's wide light as well as focus light.
86Elj9MnuqU,292000,298000,Now the light's 2 rooms away but you can still see clearly.
86Elj9MnuqU,305000,316000,This is also priced under Rs 500 but it's worth every penny & you can carry it like a pen.
86Elj9MnuqU,317000,321000,Let's check the water temperature since I put some cold water in it.
86Elj9MnuqU,322000,326000,The normal water showed the same temperature but now the cold water temperature has lowered.
86Elj9MnuqU,327000,332000,And we even put hot & cold water just to check & did its job well.
86Elj9MnuqU,333000,338000,And I wouldn't generally recommend this product but we ordered it under Rs 500.
86Elj9MnuqU,339000,342000,"It has a 45 days battery life, the Mi Band 7."
86Elj9MnuqU,343000,347000,"No, it's not a Mi Band 7, but is a duplicate M4 at Rs 500."
86Elj9MnuqU,348000,353000,If you want to show that you have a Mi Band then you can get it.
86Elj9MnuqU,354000,362000,But its functionality & touch response is not that good but it looks like a Mi Band.
86Elj9MnuqU,363000,368000,Its quality is also not that great. The Mi Bands are priced at Rs 2.5-3k.
86Elj9MnuqU,369000,374000,This is at Rs 500 & it shows. So I won't recommend it for usage.
86Elj9MnuqU,375000,382000,It says it has a 45 day battery but I don't think it might go beyond 4-5 days.
86Elj9MnuqU,383000,387000,But it's under Rs 500 so we thought we'd include it in the list. And it looks exactly like the Mi Band.
86Elj9MnuqU,388000,398000,Friends there are Smartwatch & AirPods under Rs 500 & the video is coming soon as Part 2.
86Elj9MnuqU,399000,403000,"All products mentioned have their links in the description, do check them out."
86Elj9MnuqU,404000,407000,"That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"
