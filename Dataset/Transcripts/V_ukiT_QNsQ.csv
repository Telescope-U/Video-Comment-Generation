V_ukiT_QNsQ,719,7120,they looked at the most successful men  and women of the world  and they found that they had like seven  eight things in common and one of the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,7120,13840,things they all had in common was a  routine  failing to prepare was preparing to fail  the night before a game i ate the same
V_ukiT_QNsQ,13840,19920,food i went to bed at the same time i  got up i ate the same breakfast  so the routine and the preparation some
V_ukiT_QNsQ,19920,27920,people call it superstition  but it's a routine the stronger your  mindset  is the greater your skill set is going
V_ukiT_QNsQ,27920,33280,to be  we remember the stuff we earn the stuff  we experience more than what the teacher
V_ukiT_QNsQ,33280,38480,tells us or what someone gives us for  free  a company is simply a group of people as
V_ukiT_QNsQ,38480,45840,a leader of people  you have to be a great listener you have  to be a great motivator  you have to be very good at praising and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,45840,51360,looking for the best in people  you think people you think warren  buffett reading just to be read the  majority of you are
V_ukiT_QNsQ,51360,56559,poor because you read poor stuff  everything was done to try to learn how
V_ukiT_QNsQ,56559,62559,to become a better basketball player  everything everything and so when you  have that point of view
V_ukiT_QNsQ,62559,70240,then literally the world becomes your  library  to help you to become better at your  craft it's what goes on between this
V_ukiT_QNsQ,70240,75759,year and this year  and in our hearts that determine our  lives out there there's no there's no
V_ukiT_QNsQ,75759,81759,world out there except what's going on  here  i think it's important that you really  like whatever you're doing if you don't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,81759,87759,like it  life is too short if i'm lying to you  about who i am  or i'm lying to you about whatever
V_ukiT_QNsQ,87759,93920,there's no starting point  there's a false reality right you have  to create the real reality
V_ukiT_QNsQ,93920,99600,it's a good separation for me you know  emotionally to be able to put myself in  a place where
V_ukiT_QNsQ,99600,105040,at practice or when i'm training or  during games i switch my mind to  something else
V_ukiT_QNsQ,105040,110320,i became number one in the world i  became a millionaire not because i made  more money
V_ukiT_QNsQ,110320,115920,i became a millionaire because they told  me millionaires  only live off of 30 of their income i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,115920,122479,became a millionaire because i did what  millionaires did  i stopped living off a hundred percent  what does it mean time is money
V_ukiT_QNsQ,122479,129840,right how do you multiply time how do  you buy time rich people buy  time
V_ukiT_QNsQ,129920,136480,most of people watching this thing  should either not be in business  if they've got one or close the down if
V_ukiT_QNsQ,136480,142160,they got one  because you got in business for all the  wrong reasons  and you don't have the balls to close
V_ukiT_QNsQ,142160,150319,them down because of what other people  are going to say  you don't you have no idea how
V_ukiT_QNsQ,150319,158560,limitless it is when you're not afraid  of what other people think or say  you have no idea there's not two people
V_ukiT_QNsQ,158560,164000,watching this thing  that even has a concept of what it is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,164000,170720,to act as if you have no limits to your  abilities zero
V_ukiT_QNsQ,170720,177120,i wrote a book and uh called the  millionaire booklet  wrote that book in two hours it was  translated 38 languages
V_ukiT_QNsQ,177120,185120,for free because of my social my social  media standing  around the world i just asked a bunch of  people can you help me 38 languages and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,185120,190879,literally in one month the whole book  was produced written  translated like you need friends
V_ukiT_QNsQ,190879,195920,counter-intuitive  50-page pamphlet type book yeah you're  making not the new york times bestseller
V_ukiT_QNsQ,195920,201200,yeah where'd that come from another  contrarian again again like like the  book publishers you know they're they're
V_ukiT_QNsQ,201200,207280,dying  they're they're they're they're they're  come on man that's antiquated that you
V_ukiT_QNsQ,207280,212879,don't even count digital downloads like  what's wrong with you right so give them  something they can read in a couple  hours
V_ukiT_QNsQ,212879,218080,give him something 19 months to write my  last book because the publisher was  involved
V_ukiT_QNsQ,218080,224560,okay i'm not supposed to write a book  while i'm writing a book  so i wrote a booklet
V_ukiT_QNsQ,224560,231680,okay wrote the booklet in two hours  the booklet made more money in 19 days
V_ukiT_QNsQ,231680,237040,than the other book made in 19 months  and was translated translated in 38  languages
V_ukiT_QNsQ,237040,242640,the other book that took 19 months  publishers editors  but you know all this energy all this
V_ukiT_QNsQ,242640,248000,wasted freaking energy and money  still hasn't been translated
V_ukiT_QNsQ,248000,254480,so speed see i'm now back to how fast  can i work  compressed time time is money most
V_ukiT_QNsQ,254480,259680,people don't  don't even understand the concept like  what does that even mean they say it but  they don't know what it means yeah oh
V_ukiT_QNsQ,259680,264880,it's a cute saying  it's a perfect t-shirt but they're not  actually applying it to their life no  they're like what does that mean man
V_ukiT_QNsQ,264880,270960,what does it mean time is money  right how do you multiply time how do  you buy time rich people buy time
V_ukiT_QNsQ,270960,277600,so never say i can't afford it  i would my rich dad forbid
V_ukiT_QNsQ,277600,286400,his son and me to say the words i can't  he says ask yourself how can i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,286400,292400,so you know like  the reason i have so much money is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,292400,299199,because i don't say i can't do it i just  go how can i do it  and i just go and do it i make a lot of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,299199,304560,mistakes  but that's how i learn how can i the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,304560,312479,poorest  the poor people like my poor dad always  said i can't afford it do you think i  made up money  i'm a school teacher i can't do that and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,312479,317759,i  picked that up and my rich dad never  said those words  so when i meet poor people they use the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,317759,323919,words i can't a lot  [Music]  you know it's like my wife kim is  gorgeous you know absolutely drop dead
V_ukiT_QNsQ,323919,329440,gorgeous  the first thing i said is she won't go  out with me you know  my friends kept saying she'll never go
V_ukiT_QNsQ,329440,335280,out with you and i said well  if i let that stop me she never will so
V_ukiT_QNsQ,335280,343520,i asked her out for six months  so do that i mean it's what goes on
V_ukiT_QNsQ,343520,349440,between this year and this year  and in our hearts that determine our  lives out there there's no
V_ukiT_QNsQ,349440,356560,there's no world out there except what's  going on here  so the people that say i can't afford it  i can't do this i can't get the college
V_ukiT_QNsQ,356560,361919,the rich are evil you know i choose not  to participate  that and that's one thing people could
V_ukiT_QNsQ,361919,369360,change today correct  right now is that dialogue in their head  stop saying the word can't  i can't right so how can how can i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,369360,377120,especially as in i can't afford it how  can i afford that  because that opens them up to looking at  it as an investment to a greater future
V_ukiT_QNsQ,377120,384880,right you know when i borrowed 300  million dollars  i couldn't do it when until i went to  ask and i got turned down so many times
V_ukiT_QNsQ,384880,390080,i said you know  and every time i show the bank of my  financials and they go
V_ukiT_QNsQ,390080,395520,sorry i said look do me a favor why did  you turn me down
V_ukiT_QNsQ,395520,402560,and he tell me if this is out your  numbers are out here  so if i get these numbers fixed can i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,402560,408560,come see you again  he goes sure and he turned me down again  but i didn't go back
V_ukiT_QNsQ,408560,416000,and i put i'd make i make sure the  numbers were real  and fix it so it's called rejection you
V_ukiT_QNsQ,416000,421840,know same as my wife rejected me for six  months  it's just a matter of personal willpower
V_ukiT_QNsQ,421840,429199,which is spiritual  just saying if they can do it i can do  it  and how can i how can i and i think as
V_ukiT_QNsQ,429199,436720,you once said  words become flesh yep you think people  you think warren buffett reading just to  be read  the majority of you are poor because you
V_ukiT_QNsQ,436720,442000,read poor stuff  you watch poor stuff you on instagram
V_ukiT_QNsQ,442000,444720,watching fights
V_ukiT_QNsQ,448319,454800,you just scrolling through like you  ain't got a life for real some of y'all  on instagram you're on there for 30  minutes  if i ask you what you saw you only know
V_ukiT_QNsQ,454800,459950,you're just scrolling through  that's a poverty mindset
V_ukiT_QNsQ,459950,465280,[Music]  rich people don't waste time they  realize it's their most important
V_ukiT_QNsQ,465280,471520,commodity  they don't watch a lot of tv they don't  do a lot of entertainment  if they're not working they're studying
V_ukiT_QNsQ,471520,478080,their craft and getting better at their  craft  oh you okay i'm sorry okay let me say it  one more time
V_ukiT_QNsQ,478080,485280,there was a language that i needed to  learn does it does it mean i need to  abandon the learn the language that i  learned absolutely not
V_ukiT_QNsQ,485280,490560,does it mean i need to put on a certain  type listen to me when i do corporate i  promise you  i look like this i probably don't look
V_ukiT_QNsQ,490560,495840,this good sometimes i got on shorts and  a t-shirt  in corporate why because i don't need to
V_ukiT_QNsQ,495840,501120,necessarily conform  they're not asking me to come to dress  up but i'm so good at what i do they
V_ukiT_QNsQ,501120,506319,don't even require a suit  are you hearing what i'm saying some of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,506319,511680,us don't want to wear a suit but you're  not on that level though  or you want to wear a suit and act as if
V_ukiT_QNsQ,511680,517440,your suit is going to compensate for  what you are inferior at  your suit don't your suit don't make
V_ukiT_QNsQ,517440,522640,your language sweet  real some of you wearing suits because  you think like you're going to impress  somebody
V_ukiT_QNsQ,522640,527120,with a suit and you might get in the  door but sooner or
V_ukiT_QNsQ,533040,538959,whoa what are you later i was like i'm  quitting my mom's like don't you dare  quit you're going to embarrass me you  got a wife and kids

V_ukiT_QNsQ,544959,550000,yo ma i'm trying to be funny and i ain't  trying to be disrespectful i love you  but you can't teach me how to be a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,550000,556080,millionaire because you're not one  [Music]  you come from the working class and i'm  not mad at you ma we wouldn't be where
V_ukiT_QNsQ,556080,562399,we are without you but you told me  that every generation is supposed to get  better so i'll take your values but i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,562399,569360,won't take your work ethic  because rich people don't work they  think
V_ukiT_QNsQ,569760,577120,the working class will never get rich  it wasn't designed oh yeah okay
V_ukiT_QNsQ,577120,582480,listen to me this country became a  wealthy country  because they had employees they didn't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,582480,588240,have to pay  that's not that's not that's not like a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,588240,594320,rocket science  so when this country had to start paying  people they want to pay the lease the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,594320,601920,three percent  that run the world they're not trying  let me let me tell you how i know i'm  from detroit  we just laid off 15 000 workers and the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,601920,609120,president of gm she just got 22 million  dollars  we got 22 million dollars to get one
V_ukiT_QNsQ,609120,616880,person when we land off 15  000 people and we took their health care  that's already paid for
V_ukiT_QNsQ,616880,624000,no disrespect to nobody and i ain't  playing no victim because i'm not a  victim  rich people don't work they think poor
V_ukiT_QNsQ,624000,631200,people work  poor people go clock in i make this much
V_ukiT_QNsQ,631200,636959,an hour  rich people go i put them to work and i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,636959,642240,make this much in a house  see what happens is you're working for
V_ukiT_QNsQ,642240,647839,you and your family one  they got 40 of you working at one time
V_ukiT_QNsQ,648160,654880,so they giving you 20 and they keeping  the 80  off of 15 000 people that's enough to
V_ukiT_QNsQ,654880,660720,have 22 million dollars  so what you have to decide is are you  going to keep being the 99
V_ukiT_QNsQ,660720,666240,are you ready to be a part of the one  percent because it doesn't make a  difference where you come from high  school dropout
V_ukiT_QNsQ,666240,672079,it doesn't make a difference when you  come from ged it doesn't make a  difference where you come from sleeping  in abandoned buildings it doesn't make a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,672079,678079,difference where you come from  a 17 year old mom that got pregnant it  doesn't make a difference when you come  from south side of chicago
V_ukiT_QNsQ,678079,683440,it doesn't make a difference where you  come from pretty much raised in detroit  it doesn't make a difference where you  come from took 12 years to get a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,683440,689600,four-year degree it doesn't take a make  a difference you know what makes a  difference  what makes a difference is when you  become a 99
V_ukiT_QNsQ,689600,695519,or a 1 and when i start thinking like  acting like and behaving like a one
V_ukiT_QNsQ,695519,702959,percenter  everything changed is that clear
V_ukiT_QNsQ,702959,708560,i'm here to talk about success  [Music]
V_ukiT_QNsQ,708560,714399,the first rule of success is to have a  vision  you see if you don't have a vision of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,714399,719839,where you go and if you don't have a  goal where you go  you drift around and you never end up
V_ukiT_QNsQ,719839,724959,anywhere  i mean as you know i was born in 1947 in  austria
V_ukiT_QNsQ,724959,733040,after the second world war so i was very  fortunate  that i stumbled under my vision
V_ukiT_QNsQ,733040,739519,and i didn't really like austria when i  grew up  i couldn't wait to get out of there i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,739519,745600,couldn't see myself becoming a farmer  or a worker in a factory or anything
V_ukiT_QNsQ,745600,751680,like that  even though my parents wanted me to stay  there and have a normal life
V_ukiT_QNsQ,751680,758079,but that was their vision not mine my  vision was totally different i felt that  i was born for something special for
V_ukiT_QNsQ,758079,765920,something unique  for something big then one day i went to  school  i remember was 11 years old
V_ukiT_QNsQ,765920,771440,and they showed a documentary about  america  there they showed this documentary the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,771440,778560,huge skyscrapers  the high rises the huge bridges
V_ukiT_QNsQ,778560,786399,the six lane freeways  and all of this stuff in the same  reserve that's where i want to be
V_ukiT_QNsQ,786399,793279,i don't want to be around here with  these little farm houses and these  little buildings  i want to be in america one day
V_ukiT_QNsQ,793279,798320,after school i walked by a store in graz  so i went inside and i looked around and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,798320,803519,then i saw a magazine  it's a bodybuilding magazine that had  reg park
V_ukiT_QNsQ,803519,810480,on the cover reg park was then a  three-time mister universe  and i saw him on the big screen as
V_ukiT_QNsQ,810480,817920,hercules  i read that and i said to myself wow  this is the blueprint for my life
V_ukiT_QNsQ,817920,822959,this is exactly what i want to do i want  to become a bodybuilding champion just
V_ukiT_QNsQ,822959,829519,like rage park  i want to get into movies just like rich  park  and i want to make millions of dollars
V_ukiT_QNsQ,829519,834639,and be rich and famous  just like reg park do you know how great
V_ukiT_QNsQ,834639,840480,it felt  that i knew where i was going  imagine the majority of people don't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,840480,846880,know where they're going  i knew where i was going that i'm going  to become this bodybuilding champion
V_ukiT_QNsQ,846880,854480,just like him so it was just a question  of how do you do it  i was so relieved because when you have
V_ukiT_QNsQ,854480,859839,a goal when you have a vision  everything becomes easy so people always
V_ukiT_QNsQ,859839,866000,ask me  when they saw me in the gym in the  pumping iron days  they said why is it that you're working
V_ukiT_QNsQ,866000,873440,out so hard  five hours a day six hours a day and you  have always a smile on your face
V_ukiT_QNsQ,873440,880320,and i told people all the time i said  because to me  i'm shooting for gold in front of me is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,880320,885680,the mr universe title  so every rep that i do gets me closer to
V_ukiT_QNsQ,885680,891440,accomplishing that chord to make this  core  this vision turn into reality every
V_ukiT_QNsQ,891440,897199,single  set that i do every repetition every  weight that i lift will get me a step  closer to
V_ukiT_QNsQ,897199,902399,turn this goal into reality so i  couldn't wait to do another 500 pound
V_ukiT_QNsQ,902399,909279,squat  i couldn't wait to do another 500 pound  bench press  i couldn't wait to do another 2 000 reps
V_ukiT_QNsQ,909279,914800,of sit-ups  i couldn't wait for the next exercise  with the age of 20 i went to london
V_ukiT_QNsQ,914800,919839,and i won the mr universe contest as the  youngest mr universe ever
V_ukiT_QNsQ,919839,925199,and it was because i had a goal  [Applause]
V_ukiT_QNsQ,925199,931279,so let me tell you something visualizing  your goal and going after it  makes it fun you've got to have a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,931279,940000,purpose no matter what you do in life  you've got to have a purpose
V_ukiT_QNsQ,940000,947360,but you have to do something every day  that scares you scares you  and um and that's uh
V_ukiT_QNsQ,947360,953839,a takeoff from helen keller who said  or not said uh she was deaf dumb
V_ukiT_QNsQ,953839,959440,everything she couldn't do anything and  she said every day she did something to  scare herself
V_ukiT_QNsQ,959440,966000,well if you and i had all those  afflictions just getting out of bed  would be scary enough and so i decided
V_ukiT_QNsQ,966000,971519,that one of the differentiations between  the people  that got the most out of the the  week-long seminar
V_ukiT_QNsQ,971519,978959,and the year-long free mentoring for me  is  people that really pressed themselves  hard so i translated that into
V_ukiT_QNsQ,978959,984399,they've got to do something and list it  what they did  to scare themselves every single day is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,984399,990160,that the essence of really what you do  is getting people to take more risk or  to get out of their comfort zones and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,990160,995199,then the wealth comes later  it's not just out of their comfort zones
V_ukiT_QNsQ,995199,1001519,it's the change  of reality okay you know  your reality is different than my
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1001519,1007360,reality and you know your followers  realities  are all different uh but it's to change
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1007360,1013440,your reality  and to make yourself uh accountable  that's not just getting outside your  comfort zone making yourself accountable
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1013440,1020000,okay uh not just accountable not  accountable to somebody else  accountable to you me you know yourself
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1020000,1027438,because that's the ultimate  uh ultimately that's the only person you  should be accountable to  is yourself and we grow up
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1027438,1034480,in my judgment wrongly that the that we  don't hold ourselves  accountable enough we just don't we
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1034480,1041600,we've learned  to come up with reasons why we can't do  this  reasons why it's okay not to do this
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1041600,1047678,reasons why you didn't follow up on time  reasons why i told the guy i'd get back  to him by wednesday it's now friday
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1047678,1053440,oh it's the weekend i'll now get back to  him till  you know on monday and uh life has
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1053440,1058480,gotten  simpler now with the internet and with  email and the things
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1058480,1066559,where the communication is almost  instant you think it should be easier  but it's not i use the analogy 25 30
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1066559,1073039,years ago you're going to buy  a 100 million company your due diligence  would be three  four five weeks and it'd take you three
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1073039,1082320,four five weeks  to close the deal okay a month and a  half  six to eight weeks with the internet
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1082320,1088320,it should take less time because the  information is instantaneous  it takes us twice as long to close a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1088320,1094559,deal now  twice as long there's no reason for that
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1094559,1100240,things haven't gotten twice as  complicated  but somebody has to put their name on
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1100240,1105520,the line  somebody wants to push off the  accountability somebody would rather  have brian
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1105520,1110880,sign off on it so i go home early on a  thursday  knowing you're going to come in early on
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1110880,1117600,a monday and your signature will be on  the document instead of mine  because i don't want to be accountable
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1118080,1125679,and so the kids today have this need  it's like this thirst for for guidance
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1125679,1133039,and the kids do better in the year-long  mentor program  than the older kids so the kids in their
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1133039,1138640,teens and twenties uh do better than the  guys in their 40s and 50s  that's because the guys in their 40s and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1138640,1144080,50s got a lot of baggage bad habits  bad habits you know and it's tough to  get rid of them
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1144080,1149679,and the um you know motivation gets you  started  good habits keep you going most people
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1149679,1155919,just have piss poor habits  and you know i've had these same habits  for about 50 years now
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1155919,1161280,okay about 50 years and i don't even  think about it i mean it's just like  brushing my teeth
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1161280,1166720,taking a shower i just do it and uh and  i and  one of the other interviews that uh i
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1166720,1172000,did with you i said  when i do feel whimpish which isn't too  often i just say
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1172000,1178400,come on and and i just go out and do it  uh and and and i do that about my entire
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1178400,1185600,life  uh everything about it and and  and i know that if i had to build up
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1185600,1193039,these habits  20 30 years ago you know at age 70 i  certainly wouldn't be doing this
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1193039,1199840,i don't fail very often i i do fail  you're pretty open about all the  failures yeah i'm not ashamed of them
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1199840,1206159,right that's who  that's what's made me who i am you said  failure is just testing  correct it's just testing and i don't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1206159,1211840,know and  i'm quick to pull the trigger two ways  i'm quick to pull the trigger and trying
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1211840,1216799,something  and i'm quick to pull the trigger and  closing something
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1219440,1226159,just turn the key what does that mean  turn the key turn the key means close  the [ __ ] business  most of the people watching this thing
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1226159,1233280,should either  not be in business if they've got one or  close the  down if they got one
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1233600,1240000,because you got in business for all the  wrong reasons  and you don't have the balls to close  them down because of what other people
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1240000,1246880,are going to say  you don't you have no idea how
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1246880,1255120,limitless it is when you're not afraid  of what other people think or say  you have no idea there's not two people
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1255120,1260559,watching this thing  that even has a concept of what it is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1260559,1265759,to act as if you have no limits to your  abilities zero
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1267840,1274480,lack of self-esteem lack of self-worth  now they think they have self-worth they
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1274480,1280320,think because they've made a few bucks  but in actuality and when they measure  it against the other eight ten twelve
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1280320,1288480,people sitting around the table  they realize or they start to question  hell maybe i was just lucky now all of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1288480,1295760,us  when you're only a one-trick guy or gal  think was i lucky now i've done it so
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1295760,1301200,many times i know i'm i wasn't lucky  i might have been lucky the first time  but i haven't been lucky the 15 20
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1301200,1306240,45 i know that okay but maybe i was  lucky the first time
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1306240,1311600,but my life changed when i went i was  pretty much a  haphazard kid got a lot of trouble got
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1311600,1317520,arrested four or five times  thrown in jail and this is with my dad  as a cop
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1317520,1323679,but then i went i volunteered for the  draft um in 1966  at the height of the vietnam war and uh
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1323679,1329679,i went to ocs  and that changed my life because it was  the really first  real high performance thing that i could
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1329679,1335360,measure myself against other with other  people  two-thirds of all fortune 500 ceos have
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1335360,1340880,one thing in common  military background really two-thirds of  those two-thirds
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1340880,1348320,have something else martial arts  what do you learn in martial arts brian
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1348320,1353840,discipline  focus a lot of people don't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1353840,1360240,believe they deserve to be there  i convince them and we have these drills
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1360240,1366159,why you belong there a lot of people  that come there you know with money that  have made money
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1366159,1374320,think they made it by accident right i  just had one of my superstars who's made  a hundred million bucks  tell me in the last week you know
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1374320,1381039,i'm not sure i'm going to have another  lucky accident  and i said you did it i mean you know
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1381039,1387679,you tried a lot of things i believe  thomas edison i would i wouldn't have  done it ten thousand times  okay i would hire an engineer from mit
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1387679,1392960,to do it but i mean  uh i've tried a lot of things nobody's  failed at more things
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1392960,1398320,than i have and the first hundred  million are successes but i could write  a book about failures that would be
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1398320,1404559,i mean because i've tried a lot of  different things because  failure is just testing and uh one of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1404559,1409760,the reasons i've been so successful in  generating this equity  and value in my kids and i call you all
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1409760,1415120,kids  is because i convince him that making a  mistake is okay
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1415120,1421520,your parents probably told you you can  be anything you want  but you can't that's horse
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1421520,1426960,you can't if it's all juxtaposed  [Music]
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1426960,1433360,so but what you tell him is that  you can do anything you want that you  have passion for
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1433360,1439120,because that eliminates most of the crap  because most people don't follow their  dream  you know like they say in the sound of
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1439120,1445679,music you can't have a dream come true  unless you have a dream  now i still dream i dream of technicolor
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1445679,1453520,i say my affirmations and goals every  single night  it's bloody hard to be a high
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1453520,1461600,performance person  74 percent hate their job in america
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1461600,1468640,now there's not much different when you  come to europe the majority of people  don't like what they're doing because
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1468640,1474799,they're really not doing it because they  didn't have a goal and they followed the  score  they just aimlessly drift around and
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1474799,1481039,then all of a sudden there's a job  opening so they get their job  because you have to work but then when
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1481039,1488400,you work  it's a chore it's work  it's not fun so if you think about only
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1488400,1494480,a quarter of the people really enjoy  what they're doing  in life that is unbelievable if you
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1494480,1501120,think about it so i felt so blessed that  i knew what i was doing  it's like a medical student that studies
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1501120,1508000,and knows he wants to become a doctor  you know where to go  and the same thing is also in politics
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1508000,1513120,i remember that in politics i had a very  clear vision  [Music]
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1513120,1519760,that i will be the leader of california  this is as far as i could go because i  was not born in america so i could not
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1519760,1526320,run for president  so being the governor of the fifth  largest state
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1526400,1533200,of i should say the largest state the  fifth largest economy  in the world was for me really
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1533200,1539120,the ultimate title the ultimate  accomplishment in politics  so even though people came up to me says
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1539120,1544480,why don't you go  and run for something smaller you're  never gonna make it
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1544480,1552000,i ran for governor and then two months  later i became governor of the state of  california  again because i had a very clear vision
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1552000,1557840,what i'm gonna do  with california
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1558320,1564799,so that's rule number one have a vision  rule number two is don't listen to the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1564799,1571840,naysayers  don't listen to the naysayers
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1574400,1584080,everything i ever did the thing that  they heard out of people's mouth was  that's impossible that can't be done or
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1584080,1590559,no  that is exactly what i heard and of  course i proved to the people that it  can't be done
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1590559,1598559,so whenever someone said to me it can't  be done i heard  it can be done when they said no i heard
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1598559,1605278,yes  and when they said it's impossible i  heard it is possible
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1605440,1612080,i'm a strong believer what nelson  mandela said  that everything is always impossible
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1612080,1617760,until  someone does it well i'm gonna be the  one that said to myself i'm gonna do it
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1617760,1623840,and i'm gonna show it to them  maybe it has never been done before  that's perfectly fine with me
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1623840,1629520,but i'm gonna do it and i did not listen  to the naysayers
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1629520,1636480,success means different things to  different people  for some success might be financial
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1636480,1644159,achievements  becoming a millionaire for example  for some it might mean accolades
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1644159,1652240,for sportsmen it may mean trophies  championships or medals  for some being successful might simply
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1652240,1659520,mean  achieving a state of wellness health  or happiness whatever it means to you
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1659520,1665919,take note of these 10 habits  of all successful people they apply
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1665919,1674960,to any area and any meaning of success  number one they set goals
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1674960,1681600,you've probably never met a successful  person who doesn't set goals  because the chances of you finding what
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1681600,1688720,you want without a clear target to move  forward  are right around zero if you don't know
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1688720,1694240,where you're going  you will end up some place you didn't  plan to be
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1694240,1701440,setting goals should be the number one  priority for anyone seeking success
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1701440,1708559,define exactly what it is you want  your end goal break down exactly what is
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1708559,1715919,required  to get there many goals  make sure your why your reason for doing
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1715919,1721600,what you must do  is strong so when you hit those  roadblocks
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1721600,1728640,when things go wrong as they always do  you have the strength and purpose
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1728640,1735039,to keep going  number two they take responsibility for
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1735039,1740120,their life  another key attribute of all successful  people is they take complete
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1740120,1747360,responsibility  for the success and the failures  in their life unlike the majority they
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1747360,1756000,never play the victim role  if something doesn't work out they don't  blame others  they learn the lesson learn one more way
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1756000,1761520,not to do something and move on quickly  your energy is always best spent in the
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1761520,1767520,present  and planning for the future your thought  process should always be
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1767520,1774640,how can i make this work and what can i  learn from this never living in the past
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1774640,1781520,or making excuses as to why you aren't  where you should be remember everyone
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1781520,1786880,suffers setbacks everyone  has the opportunity to either blame
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1786880,1792799,others in circumstances  or to focus on moving on and creating a
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1792799,1800159,better future regardless of what has  happened  you decide what you do
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1800159,1807039,now number three they have great  self-discipline discipline is a strong
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1807039,1812720,trait of all successful people  and it is one that can be developed with  consistent
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1812720,1818880,use anyone that works from home or  unsupervised knows the importance of  self-discipline
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1818880,1825279,when you are alone will you choose to go  through  social media watch cat videos on youtube
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1825279,1832799,or do something that will be beneficial  for your future  it is much easier to have discipline
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1832799,1839039,if you have clear goals and a meaningful  purpose  something that is much more important
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1839039,1846799,than  meaningless distractions number four  they are obsessed with self-development
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1846799,1852720,you can't really claim to be successful  if you have given  up working on yourself this doesn't mean
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1852720,1858080,you are never  satisfied just that you know it is human  nature

V_ukiT_QNsQ,1886480,1893440,for two minutes without becoming  bored picking up their phone to go on  social media  probably to post about how bored they
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1893440,1898480,are successful  people however are almost always
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1898480,1905039,happy to be alone to be alone in  quiet to have the opportunity to read
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1905039,1912880,or listen to something that will benefit  their mind  and their future if you're not a reader
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1912880,1919039,try audio books you can play them in  your car  in the gym or while you shower and use

V_ukiT_QNsQ,1927519,1935200,they manage their time well  time management is essential to success
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1935200,1941760,unsuccessful people usually get stressed  and overwhelmed when there are  too many tasks on their to-do list
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1941760,1947039,successful people  are rarely phased they prioritize the  big
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1947039,1952640,payoff and most rewarding tasks first  and leave the insignificant ones
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1952640,1959600,to last knowing it matters most to do  the most  valuable tasks first successful people
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1959600,1966720,plan in advance  days weeks months ahead knowing  clearly what needs to be done to

V_ukiT_QNsQ,1972799,1978640,they take risks if you don't buy a  ticket  you can't win the raffle if you don't
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1978640,1984240,take big risks you can't achieve  big rewards successful people know
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1984240,1989679,that there will be times they will need  to take risks in order to get where they  need to go
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1989679,1996480,often most people won't take those same  risks  for fear of failure however
V_ukiT_QNsQ,1996480,2003120,the greater failure to successful people  would be that of regret risk
V_ukiT_QNsQ,2003120,2009690,going for the life you want or  guarantee living with one you don't want
