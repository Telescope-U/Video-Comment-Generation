fxm3TYqD-Kw,2560,9280,empowerment is authority  it is a sign permission slip to actually
fxm3TYqD-Kw,9280,16640,seize the day  it's the process of getting stronger and  more confident and more engaged and to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,16640,23279,be empowered is to move through the  world without any kind of fear or any  kind of apology
fxm3TYqD-Kw,26240,34320,and with these gifts comes an even  deeper privilege i believe and that is  the ability to take charge of your own
fxm3TYqD-Kw,34320,40079,life to own yourself and claim your  rights and here's what i know for sure
fxm3TYqD-Kw,40079,47600,that to whom much is given much is  expected and i have been given so much
fxm3TYqD-Kw,47600,53199,i've earned it  i've been blessed with it  but i've been given a lot
fxm3TYqD-Kw,53199,58640,and that's why i've chosen to use my  life to lift other people up
fxm3TYqD-Kw,58640,64000,nobody's journey is seamless or smooth  we all stumble we all have setbacks if
fxm3TYqD-Kw,64000,71360,things go wrong you hit a dead end as  you will  it's just life's way of saying
fxm3TYqD-Kw,71360,77840,time to change course  so ask every failure this is what i do
fxm3TYqD-Kw,77840,83200,every failure every crisis every  difficult time i say what is this here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,83200,89600,to teach me  and as soon as you get the lesson you  get to move on if you really get the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,89600,94640,lesson you pass and you don't have to  repeat the class if you don't get the  lesson it shows up wearing another pair
fxm3TYqD-Kw,94640,101520,of pants  to give you some remedial work  and what i found is that difficulties
fxm3TYqD-Kw,101520,107119,come when you don't pay attention to  life's whisper  because life always whispers to you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,107119,114079,first first and if you ignore the  whisper sooner or later you'll get a  scream  whatever you resist persists but if you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,114079,122000,ask the right question not why is this  happening but what is this here to teach  me what is this here to teach me it puts
fxm3TYqD-Kw,122000,129039,you in the place and space to get the  lesson you need my friend ed cartole  uh who's written this wonderful book
fxm3TYqD-Kw,129039,134800,uh called a new earth  that's all about letting the awareness  of who you are stimulate everything that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,134800,140400,you do he puts it like this he says  don't react against a bad situation
fxm3TYqD-Kw,140400,146319,merge with that situation instead and  the solution will arise from the  challenge
fxm3TYqD-Kw,146319,152959,because surrendering yourself doesn't  mean giving up it means acting with  responsibility
fxm3TYqD-Kw,152959,160000,i have a very big light  and so people with big lives can do big  things and so i started to think about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,160000,166800,what was the best christmas i ever had  in my life i grew up poor  on welfare with my mother for part of my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,166800,173120,life  and i remember the best christmas of my  life was when i was 12 years old and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,173120,178560,my mother had said we're not going to  have christmas  because we can't afford it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,178560,186000,i remember feeling like  it's going to be really hard  on christmas morning to go outside
fxm3TYqD-Kw,186000,191599,what am i going to do when everybody  else is outside  that's what i thought what am i going to  do when everybody else is outside and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,191599,198319,what am i going to do when i have to go  back to class and say i got nothing so  that's what i was mostly worried about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,198319,203680,and then some nuns showed up  some three nuns came to our house and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,203680,210319,they gave me a doll and they bought us  food and we had our christmas that was  the best christmas of my life because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,210319,216000,somebody remembered and i wasn't going  to have to be  the kid that said i got nothing so i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,216000,221840,wanted to be able to create that same  feeling for  children who had nothing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,221840,226879,so i decided to go to south africa  originally i wanted to do a million kids
fxm3TYqD-Kw,226879,232000,and then just realized with i only had  four weeks vacation so in four weeks i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,232000,237760,could not reach a million kids because i  didn't want to just write a check  send a donation i wanted to be able to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,237760,242799,look in each kid's face and say to that  child somebody remembered you and so
fxm3TYqD-Kw,242799,248239,that's what i did with my life this  christmas i took 41 people from here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,248239,253439,hired another 50 people over there and  we were traveling caravan from one
fxm3TYqD-Kw,253439,259600,village to the next we did 2 000 kids a  day  we had parties for children who were
fxm3TYqD-Kw,259600,265440,orphans  and it was singularly i will tell you i  could weep thinking about it the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,265440,273840,singularly the best experience of my  life  the singularly best experience of my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,273840,279440,life the first day in africa where we  had 280 kids in a room and every single
fxm3TYqD-Kw,279440,285840,one of those kids had lost a parent  every single one of those children they  were aged three
fxm3TYqD-Kw,285840,293199,to 17 in that room and my team that  you're talking about i have the greatest  team in the world my team in the here in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,293199,298560,the united states had been in contact  with the orphanages so that by the time  we got there
fxm3TYqD-Kw,298560,304000,we had a present with every child's name  on it  this summer every black doll
fxm3TYqD-Kw,304000,309360,manufacturer in the country had sent me  dolls because i these girls had never  seen black dolls and so it was my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,309360,316400,mission to do for them what the nuns had  done for me was to let the african girls  see a black doll so i wanted every girl
fxm3TYqD-Kw,316400,323199,to have a black doll i wanted every boy  to have soccer balls we bought radios we  bought clothes and the most important
fxm3TYqD-Kw,323199,330000,thing is we had their names on every box  for every child  and i called up the children one by one
fxm3TYqD-Kw,330000,335440,and when those children you know  received their gifts and then waited for  the next child to receive their gifts
fxm3TYqD-Kw,335440,341520,and said i said nobody can open their  presents until everybody can open their  presents and on the count of three when
fxm3TYqD-Kw,341520,349039,i counted the three and those children  open their presents was the single  greatest moment of my life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,349039,355680,i have a big life so i can take 50 000  presents and do that over and over and  over again to orphanage effort orphanage
fxm3TYqD-Kw,355680,361280,but what i felt in that room for those  from those kids  is a lot of what you're talking about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,361280,367199,and what you're talking about and what  you see in the faces of those women when  you look into the eyes of someone
fxm3TYqD-Kw,367199,372240,and you give them a gift whether that be  a physical gift or it be a gift from
fxm3TYqD-Kw,372240,377520,your spiritual self from your presence  from the essence of you and you see the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,377520,384319,light you see the joy what i felt in  that room was not just that i was  remembered that the child felt that i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,384319,389600,was remembered but you felt a sense of  hope a sense of validation a sense of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,389600,396000,validation that somebody cared about me  and i will tell you that of all the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,396000,401840,years and shows that i have done  and every theme for every show that i've  done
fxm3TYqD-Kw,401840,408880,the single common dynamic denominator  that i've found that every human being  is looking for is validation
fxm3TYqD-Kw,408880,415680,every single person needs to know  wants to feel that they matter
fxm3TYqD-Kw,415680,423039,that they matter and what happened in  that room that was the greatest day of  my life  i knew that those children knew in that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,423039,430319,moment that they mattered that they  mattered and so i encourage you it's  exciting to be able to write a check
fxm3TYqD-Kw,430319,435360,it's even more exciting to be able to  touch one life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,435360,441440,to be able to do that for one person  it's like cynthia was saying when you  can do that for one person when you can
fxm3TYqD-Kw,441440,446800,do that you will know that your life has  meaning and i will tell you when i left
fxm3TYqD-Kw,446800,452639,that place my friend gail and i were  there and we're all boohoo and we're  like boom with the children oh my god
fxm3TYqD-Kw,452639,458720,and gail was saying what is it what is  it we're so full as gail said to me she  said you know as big as your show is as
fxm3TYqD-Kw,458720,464879,big as your show is what happened in  that room seemed bigger  what happened in that room sing bigger
fxm3TYqD-Kw,464879,472639,and that is true that is true for me who  has this big life in a television show  and i'm telling you for everybody here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,472639,478720,extending yourself beyond your world  your kids your family your stuff and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,478720,484639,reaching out to somebody who is not like  you somebody who is like you who is
fxm3TYqD-Kw,484639,490240,indeed if you are feeling depressed or  you are feeling down or you're feeling  like things aren't going the way you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,490240,497199,want them to go in your life the way you  turn that around is to reach outside of  yourself to somebody else reach outside
fxm3TYqD-Kw,497199,502479,of yourself to somebody else it will  change you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,502479,509199,it will change you  so it is my intention
fxm3TYqD-Kw,509199,515839,my intention  to fulfill the dream of the creator
fxm3TYqD-Kw,515839,523360,it is my intention  to live to the highest calling and be  pressed to the mark of the highest
fxm3TYqD-Kw,523360,529920,calling that i have come to do  and when you can ask the creator
fxm3TYqD-Kw,529920,536640,ask that which made you you  what is your dream for me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,536640,542399,i guarantee you instead of you trying to  define the dream what is your dream for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,542399,549519,me  if you're able to lean  into the dream
fxm3TYqD-Kw,549519,556720,that the universe and all the forces of  of of of light and love and power and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,556720,563680,grace by all the names that we call god  has for you  nobody can touch you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,563680,566720,nobody can touch you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,569440,575600,so i want to talk about  my  dream for you  because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,575600,581519,i  have been so blessed  to live inside
fxm3TYqD-Kw,581519,586889,the dream of god  [Music]
fxm3TYqD-Kw,588240,593839,i figured out early on you know i had  these dreams for myself i  used to tell my father i'm going to live
fxm3TYqD-Kw,593839,598959,in a house on a hill  i'm going to have a million dollars  and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,598959,604320,i learned  early in my career that the dream i had
fxm3TYqD-Kw,604320,611440,for myself  couldn't compare  to the dream that life had for me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,611440,616640,so i figured out how to lean in to life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,616640,622160,to lean into life  and allow  the flow
fxm3TYqD-Kw,622160,630480,that was designed for me to follow  to allow that flow to be my guide
fxm3TYqD-Kw,630480,636720,and every decision i have ever made has  come from  listening to the flow that represents
fxm3TYqD-Kw,636720,641920,the truth in me  that is also the truth in you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,641920,647519,you already know the truth  you've been making decisions
fxm3TYqD-Kw,647519,653680,having choices  fulfilled throughout your life since you  were a kid
fxm3TYqD-Kw,653680,661519,and being able to make the right choice  based upon what is the truth of you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,661519,668560,is the dream and prayer i hold for you  today  because being able to do that has led me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,668560,673680,to this stage  and many other stages throughout the  world
fxm3TYqD-Kw,673680,679279,it's the truth  you know everybody has what i call this
fxm3TYqD-Kw,679279,684720,instinct this inner voice  it's called by many names intuition the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,684720,690320,divine the flow  but everybody has it  and the truth is
fxm3TYqD-Kw,690320,695920,every decision i've ever made  that led me to the right
fxm3TYqD-Kw,695920,702720,space and place in my life  i got there because i relied on that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,702720,709200,inner voice the truth of me  when i was  30 years old and about to leave
fxm3TYqD-Kw,709200,716880,baltimore  because i felt something inside  that thing that instinct that flow that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,716880,722079,truth that said it's time to move on and  every single person around me except for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,722079,728320,my best friend gail that's why she is my  best friend gail  said you shouldn't move to chicago
fxm3TYqD-Kw,728320,733600,you should stay here my bosses said  you're right here in baltimore you're
fxm3TYqD-Kw,733600,740000,little fish in a big pond you can grow  old here i go that's the problem
fxm3TYqD-Kw,740000,745040,i don't want to grow old doing the  evening news here so i listened to that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,745040,750880,inner voice that said  go  and i knew whether i got the job in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,750880,756320,chicago which of course i did or not  that it was time to leave because the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,756320,762480,truth of me was urging me forward  and every decision i made
fxm3TYqD-Kw,762480,768160,after coming to chicago when everybody  said you should just take a salary
fxm3TYqD-Kw,768160,774880,it's too big of a risk to own yourself  to own your show  what if that show fails
fxm3TYqD-Kw,774880,781920,then you're stuck  i said i'm gonna bet on myself  because the truth of me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,781920,788160,the inner voice that i was allowed to  get still and feel
fxm3TYqD-Kw,788160,795920,said  take the risk  bet on yourself  every decision i've ever made
fxm3TYqD-Kw,795920,801760,i've come back to that space  and allowed myself to live in the place
fxm3TYqD-Kw,801760,808639,of intentional  living  about 1989 after i'd been doing my show
fxm3TYqD-Kw,808639,815920,for three years i ran across a book  called the seed of the soul by gary  zhukov and in it he talked about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,815920,821839,how  every action follows  is followed by a reaction which we all
fxm3TYqD-Kw,821839,829519,know is the third law of motion in  physics but he also said that  before there's even a thought or an
fxm3TYqD-Kw,829519,835040,action there is an intention  something struck me about that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,835040,842240,there's an intention  that follow that it precedes every  thought and every action and the outcome
fxm3TYqD-Kw,842240,847250,of your experiences is determined by the  intention
fxm3TYqD-Kw,847250,852560,[Music]  at the time i was the kind of woman who  tried to do everything that everybody
fxm3TYqD-Kw,852560,857920,wanted me to do  because i just started making money the  amount of money i made was being
fxm3TYqD-Kw,857920,864160,published  i got a lot of cousins instantly  a lot of people i used to know in school
fxm3TYqD-Kw,864160,872160,and friends of mine who all needed  things and i had problems saying no  so this principle of intention is what
fxm3TYqD-Kw,872160,878320,literally saved and changed the  trajectory of my living  because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,878320,884720,i started to make my decisions  based on what i intended
fxm3TYqD-Kw,884720,891519,not just what somebody else wanted me to  do or what i thought  would please them but what do i really
fxm3TYqD-Kw,891519,897360,intend to happen from the outcome of  this decision or this choice
fxm3TYqD-Kw,897360,904880,and so i started to apply  this intentional living and this  intentional thinking to everything in my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,904880,910320,life  i said to my producers do not bring me a  show
fxm3TYqD-Kw,910320,918240,or an idea unless you have a clear  intention about why we're doing it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,918240,924720,what you want to say  what you want the outcome to be  and changing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,924720,930560,the  paradigm to just  from just doing a television show from
fxm3TYqD-Kw,930560,936560,just being on tv  to actually intending
fxm3TYqD-Kw,936560,943040,to be of service to the viewers  change the trajectory of the show the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,943040,948800,reason we were number one for 25 solid  years  is because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,948800,954399,we intended to be  we  intended
fxm3TYqD-Kw,954399,960000,to create  and to use the opportunity of being able
fxm3TYqD-Kw,960000,965279,to speak to people every day  to use that as a platform to inform
fxm3TYqD-Kw,965279,971759,their lives  in service intentionally and i would say  that the producers
fxm3TYqD-Kw,971759,979360,do not bring me an idea that i cannot  find  my thread of truth in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,979360,985759,so that i could sit in the seat  and ask the questions  with the intention
fxm3TYqD-Kw,985759,992880,of accomplishing  something bigger than the interview  so i remember the first time i used this
fxm3TYqD-Kw,992880,999360,principle of intention  there was a mother on  who had lost her 16 year old daughter
fxm3TYqD-Kw,999360,1006399,she'd been murdered by her boyfriend  junior in high school  popular straight a's
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1006399,1012480,cheerleader everybody loved her  nobody ever suspected that the boyfriend
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1012480,1018160,was  abusing her  i learned then  back in the 90s
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1018160,1025120,that domestic violence for young girls  for teenagers  is  at the same rate of domestic violence
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1025120,1032240,for  grown women in this country one out of  four  girls 14 to 18 dating
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1032240,1039918,are being abused by their boyfriends  so this girl  had hidden it from her mother and her
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1039918,1046160,friends  because girls hide it because they don't  want anybody to know
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1046160,1052480,and also because they want to keep the  boyfriend  so i went into the green room and i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1052480,1058640,asked the mother please tell me why  you're here what is your intention she  said i'm here because your producers
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1058640,1066000,asked me to come  i said but what is the reason you said  yes  what is your true intention in being
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1066000,1073039,here  and she said i want  people to know  that my daughter's life was bigger than
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1073039,1080400,her death  everywhere i go people only want to talk  about her death and how she died
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1080400,1088720,and how i didn't know or why i should  have known but i want people to know  that my daughter our daughter was loved
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1088720,1094000,she was loved by her siblings and loved  by her friends and she loved us and she
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1094000,1099919,had a life that was bigger  than her murder  and i said
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1099919,1105840,good  i can do that  i can make sure that people know that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1105840,1111280,your daughter's life meant something  that her being here on the planet earth
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1111280,1116799,for 16 years truly mattered and here's  my intention i want everybody who hears
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1116799,1122480,your daughter's story  to be able to see their friend to see  themselves
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1122480,1129200,and to know that to remain silent  can be a killer  and so every question that i ask you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1129200,1135520,comes from the point of view of an  intention  to serve  the life of your daughter so that her
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1135520,1141039,life would not have been in vain  that's the first show i won an emmy for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1141039,1147200,when i aligned the intentions and since  that time  [Music]  [Applause]
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1147200,1152640,since that time  i don't make a decision  without
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1152640,1157760,getting still  checking in  with my inner truth
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1157760,1164280,with what is the real reason i'm doing  anything
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1165550,1170720,[Music]  this whole idea of quantum physics  physics
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1170720,1177200,newton's law  nature  the way  the order of things and how
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1177200,1182559,life and nature itself operates and i  could see a reflection of my own self my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1182559,1189120,own being in all of that  and  reading newton's law third law of motion
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1189120,1196880,which says for every action there's an  equal and opposite reaction  was like a religious experience for me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1196880,1202400,i just understand me all my bells and  whistles and lights and  dancing emojis
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1202400,1208240,went off  because  i could see that  i'd experienced a little bit of that in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1208240,1214640,the color purple that beautiful line  where  whoopi as miss sealy says everything you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1214640,1221440,try to do to me is already done to you  that struck me in particular in the  movie and i understood that everybody's
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1221440,1226960,actually saying the same thing newton's  saying the same thing is missily is  saying the same thing as
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1226960,1234000,what we in this country and the other  countries call the golden rule that  really what you put out is coming back
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1234000,1239360,all the time  and  what really struck me is that it's not
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1239360,1245600,do unto others as you would have them do  unto you it really is when you do  it's already done
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1245600,1251280,because that's law  how did you turn your pain
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1251280,1257600,into purpose  well  before the pain became a purpose it was
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1257600,1263120,just an acknowledgement  of what had happened to me and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1263120,1270240,one of the things we talked about in the  what happened to you book  is that anything that has happened to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1270240,1277039,you and i wanted to just make this point  to everybody  there's not a black woman in this room  who hasn't been through something that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1277039,1283200,helped her build strength and then  something else that helped you build  strength  and then something else that helped you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1283200,1290320,build strength i mean  sometimes you go through so much you say  god don't teach me nothing else new  today i don't need no strength building
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1290320,1296400,but but this is what i know is that  strength time strength time strength  time strength every time you got
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1296400,1303039,stronger  you were building power  because strength time strength time  strength time strength equals powerful
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1303039,1309760,so we're sitting in a room amongst  ourselves with all of these powerful  women who have their stories of what
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1309760,1316400,happened to you  that you can now turn into  post-traumatic wisdom
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1316400,1321760,so what i was able to do was to take  what had happened to me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1321760,1328400,and  to use it as an empathy  builder for myself and for other people
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1328400,1334320,and it is my empathy and connection that  has allowed me to be the woman that i am
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1334320,1341440,today  and so  anything that has happened to you if you  are willing to learn from it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1341440,1347840,to open up and no longer  allow  the stigma and shame
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1347840,1353200,to cause you to hide your secrets but to  know that your vulnerability is where
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1353200,1359280,your real strength lies and take that  pain and turn it into something  meaningful for yourself and as maya used
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1359280,1364799,to say i wouldn't take nothing for my  journey now not even the sexual abuse
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1364799,1370799,the sexual assault you know when i was  raped i didn't even know  i didn't even know what a penis was
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1370799,1376880,and like so many other people in this  room who were also sexually assaulted  when they were young i didn't tell
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1376880,1384559,anybody because i knew it would be  turned on me i knew i was not in a safe  environment where other adults would
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1384559,1390080,trust my word and so i kept it to myself  until i was uh literally on an oprah
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1390080,1396400,winfrey show somebody shared their story  of abuse and i was like  i thought i was the only one i thought
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1396400,1402720,it was the only person who had been  raped and dying and molested until till  i was 14. so
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1402720,1410000,i think  being able to  take your pain  and turn it into purpose and power
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1410000,1416880,begins first with being able to  empathize with other people who've been  through the same kind of pain and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1416880,1423679,everything that's happened to you has  also happened for you  if you allow it to be  there's not one thing that has happened
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1423679,1429679,to you that you cannot now turn into  something that is useful and meaningful
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1429679,1435360,in the life that you are now leading  forward  how do you stay
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1435360,1442000,on the positive path of you know  positive hormone not even with in  regards to you know i would never do
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1442000,1448559,that again but when you have so many  negative forces even in your family they  can come in how do you stay
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1448559,1454000,in a positive place okay with positive  karma  if there are a lot of negative people in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1454000,1459039,your life don't look at them  look at the energy that you are creating
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1459039,1466320,to attract them  don't look at them look at yourself what  are you doing to draw those people
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1466320,1473279,because if you are surrounded by  negative people there's a part of you  that's willing to tolerate that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1473279,1480720,is there not  i agree i agree because there were a  couple of negative people in my life and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1480720,1486080,i chose to keep them in my life because  i didn't want to push them away like you  don't push them away because you know
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1486080,1491120,because they were friends so  you know  [Music]
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1491120,1496480,it really comes down to i mean  who do you want to be in the world who
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1496480,1502480,do you want to be not what do you want  to do not what do you want to achieve  who do you want to be what is the kind
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1502480,1508320,of person  when they're reading your eulogy what do  you want the words to be said about the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1508320,1515760,kind of person you have been  in the world  do you know the answer to that question
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1515760,1522960,do you know the answer to that question  i'm asking that of of of everybody do  you know what that is because in the end
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1522960,1528880,you know i was just at uh one of my  dear harpo  employees been here for 20 years her
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1528880,1536240,husband died suddenly of a of a brain  aneurysm it was the most  beautiful ceremony i left that ceremony
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1536240,1543279,wanting to be a better human being  because the words that were said about  him as a human being
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1543279,1550000,as a father as an uncle as a friend the  words that people spoke about him were
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1550000,1555600,so  loving and impassioned that i thought  gee when i die i don't want people to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1555600,1560880,talk about the number of shows i did  you want people to talk about how your
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1560880,1567840,love  affected them the love that you put out  into the world  yeah affected them so if that is the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1567840,1574159,paradigm that you're living from how can  i  serve  and be the most loving
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1574159,1581279,gracious giving person whatever my  talent is to all the all the girls that  you're counseling how do i do that with
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1581279,1586400,love  ultimately i'm telling you the negative  energy will change and when you become
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1586400,1592880,that force for yourself  you won't allow it i don't care what  their title or role is in your life you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1592880,1599440,just really won't  sometimes you have to divorce your  friends  and divorce your family members
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1599440,1605760,and if you handle them with love in  doing it they they will come back you  will have an opportunity to reconcile i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1605760,1613200,speak from what i know but i've had  family members who for whom i've said  i will not allow you to treat me this
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1613200,1618640,way  i will not allow you to treat me this  way  and for one family member it took him
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1618640,1626520,three years to get when you get some  sense call me  and let me know that your senses has  returned
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1626799,1631840,and what can you do when you've done all  you can  you just stand
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1631840,1638000,it's one of my favorite gospel songs  always gives me goosebump fortification  when i hear it especially when donnie
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1638000,1643760,mcclurkin sings prayed and cried  prayed and cried
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1643760,1649279,after you've done all you can you just  stand  well i read a story today about a 65
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1649279,1655440,year old ukrainian woman who  used to pride herself on her beautiful  embroidery work and now is sewing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1655440,1661440,bulletproof vests for soldiers  and grateful to still be standing to  fight the war
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1661440,1668159,it got me thinking about what it means  to keep standing  in the face of the most grave adversity
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1668159,1673279,another story a man named yuri huddled  in a church basement saying it's hell
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1673279,1680080,here imagine 200 people sitting in one  room for two days  we can't even breathe fresh air
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1680080,1686799,well i don't want to imagine it but i  know we are not supposed to turn away as  the days drag on and the ukrainian
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1686799,1692080,people keep standing in the face of such  terror and devastation
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1692080,1699520,so in our own lives what can we do to  keep standing for what's right what's  just for what will bring us peace martha
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1699520,1704559,beck says peace is our home  we deserve you deserve peace
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1704559,1710159,what can you do this week to take a  stand for peace in your own life and the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1710159,1716799,lives of those that you love  and make it so  let me know in the comments below
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1716799,1723279,because i love hearing from you  and we know that what the world needs  from all of us
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1723279,1726080,is more peace
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1732480,1738799,it's a big hard world out there  but you're ready for it and you're ready
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1738799,1745039,because  there is nothing more powerful  than you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1745039,1750960,using your personality  to serve the calling of your soul
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1750960,1758240,every one of us  has been called to the planet to use and  in this moment in this political moment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1758240,1763520,where everybody is just hysterical  in this moment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1763520,1771600,the call is for whatever side you choose  to be on  to use more of you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1771600,1780399,to bring forth the light  and to do that you've got to have  clarity about who you really
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1780399,1785840,are  there is no life without a spiritual
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1785840,1791039,life  there is no life  without
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1791039,1797279,understanding  what pierre desjardins the philosopher  and mystic said
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1797279,1802720,we are spiritual beings having  a human experience
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1802720,1810000,so your real job as you go out to try to  find one  and have all of this anxiety and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1810000,1815600,fear and  your real job  is to  know
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1815600,1821520,the truth  and to create a spiritual practice that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1821520,1827440,allows you to stay in it  to be clear i'm not talking about your
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1827440,1833760,religion  i'm talking about whatever it is that  nurtures the essence of you in such a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1833760,1840000,way  that you can do what you came here to do  and one of the reasons why i was able to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1840000,1846320,be so successful all those years on the  oprah show is because i understood there  was really no difference between me and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1846320,1853520,the audience  i was a surrogate for the audience  because i know that the audience and you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1853520,1860799,and you  and you want the same thing i do  we all want to be able to live out the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1860799,1867120,truest expression  the fullest  purest expression
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1867120,1873679,of ourselves as human beings  that's what you want  and in order to do that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1873679,1879120,you've got to practice you've got to  develop that spiritual muscle  that allows you to check in with
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1879120,1886000,yourself  and not have to ask everybody else about  a decision but to have the clarity of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1886000,1892159,your own knowing the comfort of your own  knowing  and to do that you've got to live in the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1892159,1897919,space of gratitude that is my number one  spiritual practice  i practice
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1897919,1903120,being grateful  and a lot of people say  oh oprah that's easy for you because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1903120,1911130,you've got everything i got everything  because i practiced being grateful
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1911130,1916159,[Applause]  i ran across this beautiful quote the  other day i can't remember who it was
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1916159,1922480,from that said do not waste your time  desiring what other people have
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1922480,1929760,remember the things that you now have  are things you once only hoped for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1929760,1935840,so i live in that space every day of  practicing gratitude
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1935840,1943440,because i know that being grateful  wherever you are  whatever place or space in your life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1943440,1948720,being grateful changes your personal  vibration i was just having a  conversation with cheryl sandberg the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1948720,1956159,other day about her book option b  and we all know she lost her beloved  husband david and i said how
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1956159,1961919,did you get through it and she said by  practicing gratitude  i didn't believe it at first but i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1961919,1968720,started to write down three things every  day that i was grateful for i said oh  i've been doing that for years
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1968720,1973840,because  when you wake up in the morning  looking at the world
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1973840,1979600,for what you're gonna write down or what  you're gonna state to yourself by the  end of the day that you're grateful for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1979600,1986159,you have a different outlook on life  i'm just waiting on somebody to hold the  door see if that makes the list
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1986159,1991360,some days you only have  i'm still breathing because
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1991360,1997279,life gets in the way sometimes  but practicing gratitude as a spiritual
fxm3TYqD-Kw,1997279,2003519,practice to evolve you  to bring you closer to the truth of  knowing who you really are
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2003519,2009279,is one of the most valuable things i  have ever  ever experienced and i do it i have
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2009279,2014320,journals and journals and journals and  journals filled with five things a day
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2014320,2020080,if you don't believe me just for a  moment do this close your eyes everybody  in here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2020080,2025360,we're gonna do this for five seconds  you're gonna inhale and on the exhale
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2025360,2030799,just say  thank you  [Music]  inhale
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2031519,2036880,exhale  [Music]
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2036880,2041919,do it one more time  let whatever you're most grateful for in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2041919,2048558,your heart in this moment just rise to  the surface deep breath
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2048800,2055358,thank you  open your eyes  don't you feel better
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2055358,2063358,you feel better  researchers have shown that if you can  just for 17 seconds a day 17 seconds a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2063358,2069520,day  bring yourself into the space of  presence  and gratitude
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2069520,2076878,you literally change your vibration if  you can't give yourself 17 seconds then  you don't deserve a good life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2076878,2084480,you can't give yourself 17 seconds to  breathe and say thank you then just let  whatever happens happens to you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2084480,2091760,finally i leave you with these words  i'm so happy to see my friendship  babcock who is my attorney here his wife
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2091760,2099440,nancy is a trustee here  and  chip and i go way back to 1998
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2099440,2105119,where i was on trial for saying  something bad about a burger
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2105119,2111839,it's under oprah said something bad  about a bird  so i said something bad about a burger
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2111839,2117359,and i was on trial  in texas  for six weeks
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2117359,2123040,night and day nine to five  on the witness stand
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2123040,2128079,for days testifying about burgers  and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2128079,2135760,i was confused i was like i don't  understand i was a mess i was a wreck i  forgot about intention i forgot about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2135760,2141280,and  i had to get myself still  it was hard to be still because the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2141280,2147440,cattlemen they wanted to take me down  okay so i'm on the witness saying saying
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2147440,2153440,being tried for saying something bad  about a burr and the prosecutor is  saying
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2153440,2162960,you young lady  conspired  to bring down the entire beef industry
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2162960,2169440,did you not  and you strategized with your team
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2169440,2175040,and you came up with the idea  that you were gonna do everything you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2175040,2180079,could  to take out the cattle industry
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2180079,2187520,did you not  so  i didn't  the more he's was spitting on me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2187520,2195839,and charging me with  this this this really struck me he's at  one point he says this young lady is a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2195839,2201839,liar  because she knew and deliberately tried
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2201839,2208480,to take my clients out  it's offensive when you're called a liar  and you're not
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2208480,2215760,and the more he spit and the more  he  railed and ranted
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2215760,2223280,something happened to me in the midst of  this  crisis  i started to get still which is my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2223280,2229599,prayer for you  i started to get still the crazier he  got the calmer i became
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2229599,2234960,and finally would he call me a liar i  knew in that moment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2234960,2241119,well now  that is not my truth  you can say a lot of things
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2241119,2246720,but i am not a liar and i did not  conspire to take down the entire beef
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2246720,2252240,industry  and  the more still i became
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2252240,2258160,the happier i got  i'm in the midst of this trial chip can  tell you i came off the witness stand
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2258160,2264960,and i went that was great  he said why i said cause i got to see
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2264960,2272400,and figure out who i really was  in the face  of being called a liar being called a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2272400,2279520,conspirator being told who i was not and  what i know is all trial everybody goes
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2279520,2284960,through trials i just happen to be in an  actual trial all
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2284960,2292560,people if you live long enough there's  going to be a trial in your life  it may be disease it may be jobs it may
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2292560,2299040,be any number of crises that stand  outside yourself to try to tell you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2299040,2307760,who you are are you not  and it is your job to know the truth
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2307760,2312760,and let that truth set you free
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2313250,2321520,[Music]  so we are a couple of weeks of course  into 2022 and i know that so many people
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2321520,2329359,made resolutions some of you already  broke them already whether it's to put  your health at the top of your to-do  list or follow your passion i know the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2329359,2334640,mark of a new year is that we've been  conditioned to reset and get all pumped
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2334640,2341760,up for our next chapter and all the  possibility that awaits but i want to  propose something to you all today
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2341760,2348640,i want to propose that you resolve  something very powerful  to love who you are right now and of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2348640,2354480,course i think that wanting to be your  best self and setting goals and  intentions is really major
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2354480,2360880,but i remember doing a stop on the 2020  vision tour i met this reporter in miami
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2360880,2368560,we took some photos together and she  said to me oprah next time you see me  i'm going to be so much skinnier and i  replied well the next time i see you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2368560,2375040,hopefully you're going to be as healthy  as you can be in that moment because  right now  this is as healthy as you can be in this
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2375040,2382400,moment and the next time you'll be as  healthy as you can be in that moment i  told her to be kind to herself
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2382400,2388720,and she looked at me and said how do i  do that  well it starts with loving right now who
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2388720,2394800,you are all yourself your flaws  living in a space of lack focused on  what you don't want or what you don't
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2394800,2401359,like about yourself  i i promise you i've learned it doesn't  work  take a moment to look at what is really
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2401359,2408319,running through your mind about yourself  that may be holding you back  the energy of the universe responds to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2408319,2413760,positivity and so if you're telling  yourself you're not slim enough you're  not good enough when that negative
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2413760,2420480,chatter starts in your head stops  lean away from it when you let those  thoughts of not being enough seep in you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2420480,2426480,can't really act out  the best of yourself so your actions  must be in alignment with all the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2426480,2431839,goodness and strength that you know to  be true about yourself so this week i'm
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2431839,2437280,inviting you to put on your happy  sweater wherever it is or whatever that  is for you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2437280,2442720,quiet all the negative self-talk and  allow your confidence your
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2442720,2448880,sense of knowing that better days are  ahead  to be at the forefront of your thinking
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2448880,2456560,tomorrow is never promise so let's  accept and then let's celebrate  ourselves just where we are
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2456560,2463520,right now  thank you  thank you for where i am and who i am
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2463520,2470160,right now  let that be the blessing  and intention for ourselves this week
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2470160,2477280,you know when i was a kid i thought i  was going to be a social worker or be a  teacher or somehow be in an environment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2477280,2482800,where i would be connected and speaking  to people to honor that calling i had no
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2482800,2489119,idea that god could dream this big dream  of  a television life for myself but
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2489119,2495440,everybody has a calling  and your real job  in life is to figure out as soon as
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2495440,2503200,possible what that is  who you were meant to be  and begin to honor that in the best way
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2503200,2510160,possible for yourself we have seen over  the years on the oprah show so many  people who've been able to rise to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2510160,2516480,success in their life and only able to  rise to success because  they answered the call lots of people
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2516480,2521520,think that it's about being famous or  about being known or about doing big big
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2521520,2526960,incredible things what you're going to  hear today and see  through the stories
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2526960,2532960,is that  sometimes the calling is  right in your own neighborhood sometimes
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2532960,2538000,the calling is  something that was just a whisper to you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2538000,2544319,and when you begin to honor that whisper  and to follow that  you end up being the best that you could
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2544319,2551680,be  so in my own life i have to say that  i  had no idea that i would end up being
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2551680,2558400,who i have become  but i had a strong belief that the  calling was something greater than what
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2558400,2564079,mississippi was showing me the calling  was greater than my front yard the  calling was greater than what my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2564079,2570480,grandmother believed that my life could  be  the problem is everybody is meeting
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2570480,2578480,hysteria with more hysteria  and then we just are all becoming  hysterical and it's getting worse
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2578480,2585920,what i've learned all these years is  that we're not supposed to match it or  even get locked into resisting or
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2585920,2592160,pushing against it we're supposed to see  this moment in time for what it is we're
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2592160,2599680,supposed to see through it and then  transcend it  that is how you overcome asteria
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2600720,2606000,and that is how you overcome  the sniping at one another the trolling
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2606000,2611119,the mean-spirited partisanship on both  sides of the aisle the divisiveness the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2611119,2616960,injustices and the out and out hatred  you use it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2616960,2622000,use this moment  to encourage you to embolden you and to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2622000,2627760,literally  push you into the rising  of your life
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2627760,2632960,and to borrow a phrase from my beloved  mentor maya angelou just like moons and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2632960,2639119,like suns with the certainty of tides  just like the hopes springing high
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2639119,2645839,you will rise  well you know i managed to get here  steadman and i have
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2645839,2652640,absolutely a differing philosophies  because he um teaches  the idea of he has a book called you can
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2652640,2658000,make it happen nine steps to success and  he's always um talking to me about cr
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2658000,2663680,having a vision that would with no  vision that people perish and i always  say i don't have a vision i don't have a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2663680,2668720,vision to get here to where i am my  vision was of surrendering to what i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2668720,2674800,believe was god's vision for me and i  always say god can dream a bigger dream  for you than you can dream for yourself
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2674800,2680640,i now believe that i need a vision i  think stedman is finally right  that uh in order to continue to move
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2680640,2687280,forward that i need to develop a vision  for myself and um  one of my big goals is to use this
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2687280,2692800,television show as a forum and a  catalyst for change in people's lives
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2692800,2698960,that's one of them the other is to move  out into the world in a more impactful
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2698960,2705200,global format to help women and children  across the globe without education the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2705200,2710800,people perish without education nobody  will be able to survive without
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2710800,2716800,education women cannot overcome poverty  will not be able to learn to take care  of themselves will not be able to move
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2716800,2723440,forward on the planet so i want to use  my life and this television show to  continue to do that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2723440,2728640,i think some people think that are under  the impression that i was born empowered
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2728640,2734240,that i was born  coming out of the womb ready to  interview a klansman
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2734240,2741280,but the truth is  i know very well what it's like to be  marginalized to be told either
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2741280,2747119,subtly or quite directly that my  contribution isn't or wasn't welcome
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2747119,2752240,that my face was invisible and that my  needs were an affront so back when i was
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2752240,2759200,doing the news in baltimore i asked to  be paid the same as my co-anchor who did  exactly the same job as i was doing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2759200,2764400,and i  expected that i would be compensated so
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2764400,2770240,i went in and i asked that i would get  the same amount of money so he was doing  the same job i was doing except that he
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2770240,2777040,called me babe all the time babe yeah  babe  anyway i was told by my news director
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2777040,2782240,and by the general manager because first  i went to the news record then i'm a  general manager and i was told that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2782240,2789280,because i was a single woman  who didn't have a mortgage and i didn't  have kids that i was not entitled to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2789280,2797040,earn the same kind of money as the man  who was sitting next to me  doing the same thing  and i realized in that moment that my
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2797040,2802560,employers did not get it they did not  understand my value
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2802560,2807599,but you know what i did  so cut to am chicago the team's hard at
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2807599,2814079,work and they had been working for a  long time  and after a year or so
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2814079,2820960,we were asked to be syndicated that work  began to pay off  before long we were now no longer called
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2820960,2828160,am chicago or the national oprah winfrey  show i got a raise  but my producers did not so i went into
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2828160,2833920,the boss at the time and i asked that my  producers who incidentally were all  female
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2833920,2841440,i asked that they would be given a pay  raise increase  and my boss this is in 1986 said why
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2841440,2847280,they're only girls  what do they need more money for  girls
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2847280,2853280,uh i've used the word affectionately  sometimes referring to women as girls
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2853280,2859040,and  there was no affection in his tone it  was absolutely condescending so
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2859040,2864240,you know it takes a while to develop a  voice but once you have it you damn sure
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2864240,2869280,better use it on stuff that matters  so i took a deep breath in that moment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2869280,2875680,and said  either  they're going to get raises  or i'm going to sit down
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2875680,2881040,i'm not going to work if they don't get  paid more  babe
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2881040,2888079,i would like to believe that i could  have spoken that kind of truth to  misogyny even if i'd been all by myself
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2888079,2894720,but here i was on the brink of finally  getting what i really wanted and had  been working uh many years for a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2894720,2901440,national show  i mean i might have been too intimidated  to stand my own ground against this guy
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2901440,2908000,if i were actually alone but here's the  thing you're never alone  you're never alone
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2908000,2913440,the sovereign sound of maya angelou's  voice  was pushing me forward that day
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2913440,2918960,whispering  i come as one  but i stand as ten thousand
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2918960,2925599,so when i was faced with the opportunity  to advocate for my producers  i silently called on some of the ten
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2925599,2932480,thousand  and walked into my boss's office  hand in spirit
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2932480,2940000,with the women who had come before me  i could feel bessie smith  and billy holliday an elephant's girl
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2940000,2945440,and pearl bailey and sharavon and lena  horn clutching their green books looking
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2945440,2950559,for a place to eat while they sang in  supper clubs for whites only
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2950559,2957599,and i could feel reese taylor and rosa  parks refusing to relinquish their
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2957599,2962720,dignity in the face of death threats all  these women were with me that day
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2962720,2968559,walking into the office in chicago as  was diana carroll and petula clark and
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2968559,2975359,joan baez and mary tyler moore and mom's  mabley and barbara walters and all of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2975359,2981520,the astonishing women whose  names none of us will ever even know
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2981520,2987760,despite their sacrifice  and i'm pretty sure  i even heard shirley chisholm
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2987760,2993440,urging me on with this thought  if they don't give you a seat at the  table
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2993440,2997400,bring a folding chair
fxm3TYqD-Kw,2999359,3005200,i understood that there were so many  times that many women from my mother's
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3005200,3011280,generation and god knows my  grandmother's generation who were forced  to grit their teeth and just take it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3011280,3018480,because standing up for themselves  wasn't even an option  the risk was too great
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3018480,3023599,and they knew it  but they also knew in their bones what  my dear friend maya
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3023599,3028800,put so eloquently into words when she  says you may not control all the events
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3028800,3034800,that happen to you  but you can decide not to be reduced by
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3034800,3040720,them  because these women and so many others  like them made the decision not to allow
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3040720,3047920,themselves to be reduced by the many  injustices they were subjected to  i found the strength to act if not just
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3047920,3055680,for myself  not just for my producers but for all  the women who in their ingenious ways
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3055680,3063359,subverted the rules  laid the foundation and pushed the  envelope just a little bit further for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3063359,3070640,me  we  all are here to fulfill the dreams of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3070640,3077280,those who came before us  maya used to say you've been paid for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3077280,3082559,you've been paid for young people so put  your crown on your head and wear it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3082559,3088400,we are here not merely to bear witness  but to be the new voices of an
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3088400,3093599,extraordinary new age you see when i was  growing up there were no black people in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3093599,3099119,the media just buckwheat on television  and i was constantly doing that thing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3099119,3106800,looking to find myself and what i found  and said was leave it to beaver and  donna reed and lassie although
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3106800,3112160,technically i guess lassie was mostly  brown  the the the point is though we are now
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3112160,3119599,able to see ourselves reflected through  entertainment but what pleases me most  is that we're beginning to see
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3119599,3126480,on screen  what we're beginning to see is starting  to change the landscape  of what we see behind the scenes what
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3126480,3132880,kamal was talking about true inclusion  and what i realized during all those  years during the oprah show and the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3132880,3138400,reason that own is now thriving is how  essential it is to see yourself
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3138400,3143599,reflected in other people's stories it's  something that you as white people never
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3143599,3151119,have to even think about  because the more you see a broader and  richer and more nuanced depiction of
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3151119,3157119,yourself and your neighbor and the world  the more empowered you become
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3157119,3164160,and it's that sense of empowerment that  actually tethers us to the universe it  gives us at least a glimpse of how
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3164160,3171760,connected we all are  so what a blessed sign of progress it is  to know that millions of kids in 2019
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3171760,3177920,don't have to stand with their noses  pressed up against the window or the  television screens looking in at a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3177920,3183119,family that makes them feel less than by  comparison today we can point to work
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3183119,3190240,that says you are every bit as valued  and vital to the fabric of life as
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3190240,3195599,anyone else you are a part of a  community but it takes time it takes
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3195599,3201040,time to see yourself it takes time to  hear yourself and to feel to feel
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3201040,3206559,appreciated for just being yourself  empowerment does not happen overnight
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3206559,3213680,like change it is never just one thing  it is a series of consistent steps great
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3213680,3218880,and small that proves to us again and  again that genuine change is actually
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3218880,3224319,possible  so many people are worried about  building a brand i hear kids on social
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3224319,3229760,media talking about their brand  and i used to really resent the word  when people would say to me oh you have
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3229760,3234960,this brand because i never never even  thought about a brand i just thought
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3234960,3240800,about day in and day out making the best  right choice for me
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3240800,3247440,but now i embrace it because i recognize  people see me as a brand  but for me it's not a business it is a
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3247440,3253200,question of what do you stand for  and i will say this you're nothing if
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3253200,3259760,you're not the truth  and that's the if i could leave you with  any message today that is it
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3259760,3264880,uh the biggest reward is not financial  benefits though it's really good you can
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3264880,3270960,get a lot of great shoes  nothing wrong with great shoes
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3270960,3277760,but those of you who have a lot of shoes  know that having great shoes and a  closet full of shoes or cars or houses
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3277760,3283440,or square footage doesn't fill up your  life  it doesn't
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3283440,3289200,but living a life of substance  can  substance
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3289200,3294319,through  your service your offering of your whole
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3294319,3300720,self  and the baseline for how do you live a  life of substance is whatever is the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3300720,3306880,truth for you what do you stand for  [Music]  people may not remember your every word
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3306880,3312960,they may not remember all of your  actions but they certainly remember  how your words and your actions made
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3312960,3320720,them feel  so let's leave here today  with the collective memory
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3320720,3326880,of  wanting to create enlightenment in the  world  let's leave here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3326880,3332720,knowing that we can give people the  sense  that they have been heard and respected
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3332720,3337760,let's foster original thinking  and humane treatment
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3337760,3343520,let's seek out the words we don't know  let's do away with the us and them i've
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3343520,3348880,seen us in them create a whole lot of  problems but i've never seen it solve  one thing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3348880,3354720,instead let's nourish our artists let's  offer the possibility of something
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3354720,3360839,better  for all of us  because a new day is no longer on the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3360839,3367440,horizon the new day is now  one of the things i started to get
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3367440,3373760,around  mid to late 90s is that everybody that i  had on the show at the end of the show
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3373760,3378799,would say something to me like was that  okay was that okay how was that was that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3378799,3384000,okay  at the end of the interview  and i started to then track it it didn't
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3384000,3389599,matter if it was  i had gone and done a show where i was  in
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3389599,3394960,a prison i was interviewing a father  who  was in jail for life for murdering his
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3394960,3400559,twin daughters and at the end of the  interview even behind bars he said to me  is that okay
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3400559,3406799,how'd i do  and barack obama said it when he sat in  the chair the first time and george bush
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3406799,3413520,said it  this is what i learned  sitting in that chair for 25 years that
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3413520,3418720,at the end of the day  whether you are  interviewing me or i get to interview
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3418720,3423920,you  whatever your profession is  wherever you are in your life in your
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3423920,3431040,relationships  every person that you encounter every  experience the person wants to know
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3431040,3436319,was that okay  was that okay  and what i started to hear was that what
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3436319,3444240,people are really saying is did you hear  me  did you hear me  and did what i say mean anything to you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3444240,3452240,and so i started to listen  with that in mind with that intention of  validating that your being here
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3452240,3458960,you're speaking to me you're taking the  time to do this with me is important  because you matter and that's true for
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3458960,3465599,everybody who's watching or listening  that every argument that you ever have  every encounter the person just wants to
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3465599,3472319,know did you hear me did you see me and  did i say anything that mattered  everybody works hard
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3472319,3479520,and everybody has their own dreams  there was a time where i used to spend a  lot of energy wanting things
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3479520,3484960,of course it's easy for me to say oh  things don't define you because i got a  lot of things things are nice i like
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3484960,3490799,them  but this is what i learned  when you can surrender to the dream
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3490799,3496799,you get to live in the space of the  higher power  you get to live in the space
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3496799,3505520,that you purposefully have come to earth  to claim for yourself so around 1984

fxm3TYqD-Kw,3940000,3946799,i  surrender all  and i tell you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3946799,3954400,in my greatest testimony  that the instant i laid that thing down
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3954400,3961520,i'm telling you when i laid it down  when i laid it down and it didn't have
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3961520,3966960,me anymore  it had no control over me anymore
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3966960,3973680,i didn't feel anything about it anymore  when i let it go
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3973680,3980079,when i intentionally surrendered it to  the power that was greater than i could
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3980079,3986960,ever know the instant that happened  a woman comes running out of the
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3986960,3994960,cafeteria  screaming alfred  your name all free
fxm3TYqD-Kw,3994960,4001850,for 10 years nobody could pronounce my  name  i said yes she said somebody's on the  telephone for you he's a named spielberg
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4001850,4006880,[Music]  i get to the phone
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4006880,4012079,he says i hear you're at a fat farm  i said no sir
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4012079,4017839,this is a health retreat  he says i'd like to see you in my office
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4017839,4024880,in california tomorrow this was in  wisconsin i was i'd like to see you in  my office  and if you lose a pound
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4024880,4032559,you could lose this part  no  problem do i
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4032839,4038640,have i'll have no problem not losing a  pound
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4038640,4045920,so honey i packed my bags  and i stopped at the dairy queen
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4046400,4052240,i got three scoops just in case i'd lost  a half a pound
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4052319,4060160,and the next day i was in steven  spielberg's office and he said you're  hired you're hired
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4060160,4065520,you have no idea of the power  of  noticing
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4065520,4071599,another human being  and what it feels like when somebody  knows that they have been seen truly
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4071599,4077680,seen by you  it is the greatest offering you can give  and all those years of the oprah show
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4077680,4084640,the greatest lesson i learned was that  you know after every show  uh someone would say invariably in one
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4084640,4090319,way or another um  how was that i finished an interview  with father who killed his twin
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4090319,4098318,daughters i'd finish an interview with  politician barack obama joe biden george  bush they beyonce they all say the same
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4098318,4105120,thing  how was that  and so i started to see that there's  this common thread in our humanity
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4105120,4111520,where everybody wants to know  how was that  did i do okay
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4111520,4117199,did you hear me  and did what i say  mean something to you
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4117199,4122880,so i would have to say that  recognizing that in other people has
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4122880,4129199,helped me to become you know a person of  compassion a person understanding a  person who can interview anybody about
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4129199,4137480,anything because i know that if the core  of you is the same as core me you just  want to be heard
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4140310,4145540,[Music]
fxm3TYqD-Kw,4145540,4164789,[Applause]  [Music]
