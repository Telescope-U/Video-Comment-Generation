nZ3Zc1DJOgY,107920,109360,the river now this is literally a one
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,109360,110880,minute boat ride it's like a shuttle
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,110880,112320,just across the river to get to the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,112320,113840,market on the other side right now we're
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,113840,115680,headed to the house of a local bug
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,115680,117840,vendor pun and the only way to get there
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,117840,120079,from bangkok's chinatown is by crossing
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,120079,122240,the river on a ferry to the west side
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,122240,123600,i'm really pumped because i've seen

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,133840,136160,countries but we are here in this small
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,136160,137920,local neighborhood going to this lady's
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,137920,139599,house where she's actually cooking the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,139599,141440,bugs before taking them to market
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,141440,143920,charcoal lit oil heating up assorted
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,143920,146239,baskets of bugs strewn about we've made

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,152239,154160,these lit up bug carts it can feel a
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,154160,155599,little touristy but the locals are
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,155599,156800,really eating this stuff oh yeah and
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,156800,158400,they have been for a long time most big
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,158400,160720,markets i've been to in thailand have a
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,160720,162560,bug section like most cuisine that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,162560,164640,starts out as survival food they figured
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,164640,166560,out how to make it tasty and thus it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,166560,168800,sticks around still today we've gathered
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,168800,171519,just a few uh bits of what she's cooking
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,171519,173920,here here we have an ordinary cricket
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,173920,175840,right and then here cricket on steroids
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,175840,177200,that's what i've typically called it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,177200,179120,because they're so mega they're massive
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,179120,180879,these are grasshoppers here i've never
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,180879,182400,touched these in their raw form they're
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,182400,184080,all kind of soft and leathery right now

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,189280,191360,right here the giant water bottle i
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,191360,192560,think this is the one that creeps people
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,192560,193920,out the most they look kind of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,193920,195280,intimidating but then once you taste
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,195280,196959,them there's like nothing not to like
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,196959,198910,about them

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,219680,221360,he likes them
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,221360,223280,to be fair we're here to document the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,223280,225920,cooking process there's no way that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,225920,228159,hey man this is the healthier version of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,228159,228879,it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,228879,230799,that's a good point no oil
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,230799,232159,every morning before heading to the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,232159,234640,market pond spends about two hours total
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,234640,237120,frying up all types of crawly creatures
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,237120,239280,starting with these bamboo worms you can
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,239280,241120,see as they immediately float to the top
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,241120,242799,as they get crispy how long does that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,242799,244319,take he said for half an hour it takes
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,244319,245680,that long for them to get really crispy
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,245680,246879,sometimes when you deep fry things they
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,246879,248720,get really brown fast these are still
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,248720,249760,stay white for a long time but when
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,249760,251519,they're served they're like completely
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,251519,254080,golden bam what do you know about insane

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,261840,263360,to me that's yummy it just has that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,263360,265040,fried toastiness to it kind of like a
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,265040,266560,french fry or like a cheeto but even
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,266560,268880,more airy everything must fry before
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,268880,271199,heading out giant water bugs red
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,271199,274080,grasshoppers silkworms crickets even
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,274080,275919,frogs we gotta try these man i don't
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,275919,277440,think i've tried just a straight up
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,277440,279199,fried frog in thai because of the when
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,279199,281280,they deep fry their legs and arms get
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,281280,282800,spread they say
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,282800,284800,it's like celebration

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,303680,305440,rough cutting as tempting as it would be

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,445680,447599,which is it means boat noodles so the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,447599,449440,history is that this type of noodle was
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,449440,451520,often served from a boat they serve it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,451520,453039,in really small bowls which is also key
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,453039,454319,because they would serve just a few
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,454319,455680,bites in the bowl so that as you're
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,455680,457120,splashing around in the canal it

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,468000,469199,like a chili
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,469199,470879,dressing sort of ingo's the blanched
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,470879,472160,noodles and that's water morning glory
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,472160,473440,and then pork meatballs you're right

nZ3Zc1DJOgY,481199,482639,it at the bottom of your bowl they pour
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,482639,484400,the hot soup over your bowl of noodles
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,484400,485840,and that just curdles the raw blood so
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,485840,487440,that it cooks the blood i've never seen
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,487440,489039,it made in this style here's a broth
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,489039,490479,yeah so it's a pork based soup you can
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,490479,491919,see that there's already curled blood
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,491919,493280,within that soup already the pork
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,493280,495199,noodles get pig's blood and the beef
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,495199,497199,noodles get cow's blood we're getting
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,497199,498879,five bowls of each what's your record
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,498879,500800,number of bowls doing this oh man years
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,500800,502160,ago when i first came to thailand i
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,502160,503919,would eat like 20.
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,503919,506000,20 is ridiculous i've gained some years
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,506000,508160,now
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,508319,509599,i don't even know where to start can we
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,509599,510879,eat one of them plain that's what you
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,510879,511840,should do so that you can taste the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,511840,513440,blood so you can taste the flavor of the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,513440,515039,dish before seasoning are you starting
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,515039,516560,with pork yep the broth is a little bit
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,516560,517839,thick because of that blood so you kind
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,517839,521839,of coats the noodles go for it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,522320,524560,well that's quite spicy soft tender
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,524560,526160,vermicelli noodles that have soaked up
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,526160,528640,that really spicy salty broth man you
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,528640,529760,see the blood in there it just kind of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,529760,532240,works to like thicken the soup it can't
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,532240,534240,on point any blood flavor no maybe just
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,534240,536000,a tiny like ironiness but that mostly
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,536000,537519,just like thickens the broth done so
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,537519,539279,then what you can do stack the bowls set
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,539279,541040,them over here and move in for a beef
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,541040,542640,what's happening in here okay so one
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,542640,543839,thing that you have to season with is
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,543839,545279,the chili vinegar i like to hit that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,545279,548560,with a bunch of chili flakes as well
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,548560,550399,that'll just clear your sinuses another
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,550399,551440,thing you can do actually you can
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,551440,553680,actually just dump a bowl into your next
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,553680,555760,bowl that way you keep your seasoning
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,555760,557200,from your last bowl and that way you can
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,557200,558800,add some more chili
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,558800,559680,kill meat
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,559680,561040,additionally i really like it with the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,561040,562000,basil because then you've got that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,562000,563760,refreshing touch fully kind of mix that
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,563760,565680,up so all the seasoning is spread
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,565680,567120,throughout you want to just go all out
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,567120,568800,on this bowl you want to grab some of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,568800,570800,these i just kind of crunch it as you're
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,570800,572560,letting it fall from your hands onto the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,572560,574160,noodles let me give you a few more and
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,574160,576000,that is boat noodles this is probably
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,576000,578080,one of the most popular most beloved
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,578080,579760,noodle dishes in bangkok let's jump into
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,579760,581839,it
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,583040,584800,oh i love it it's so hot too though yeah
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,584800,586640,just a full experience i'm torn between
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,586640,588240,pleasure and pain right now
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,588240,590160,super fresh everything is meaty like
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,590160,591440,irony and then you've got that fresh
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,591440,593040,basil you don't seem to be having any
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,593040,594880,adverse reactions from the spiciness oh
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,594880,596480,my god it hurts to touch my mouth with
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,596480,598480,my own mouth my tongue is uncomfortable
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,598480,600000,living inside my mouth it was pretty
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,600000,601360,spicy bro this one is not that much
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,601360,604480,right here no yeah not for me
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,604480,606800,a little sweet sour salty all at the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,606800,608560,same time this is like the classic pie
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,608560,610320,flavor it has all the flavor dimensions
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,610320,611519,in it every one of them including
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,611519,614519,painting
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,614900,619519,[Music]
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,619519,621279,we have reached our final destination
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,621279,622399,where they have tons of different
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,622399,624480,seafoods but we came here for a special
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,624480,627519,seafood it's right there
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,628399,630000,this one even scares me a little bit
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,630000,631440,it's something i've never had it's a
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,631440,633360,horseshoe crab but tell me which part of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,633360,635040,this is a crab it doesn't look like a
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,635040,637120,crab at all huge shell on the outside
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,637120,639440,it's got a tail and then it's got some
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,639440,641200,creepy crawly legs like where are even
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,641200,643360,its eyeballs right there never actually
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,643360,645040,explored one of these well what do you
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,645040,646720,actually eat in here what you eat is the
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,646720,648880,eggs within there so they're full of
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,648880,650720,eggs once they open this up they'll be
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,650720,652560,stuffed with the caviar the eggs in
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,652560,654000,there when you say caviar it does make
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,654000,656000,it sound a lot fancier
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,656000,658320,today the owner of jae kai will cook up
nZ3Zc1DJOgY,658320,660959,horseshoe crab eggs two ways starting
