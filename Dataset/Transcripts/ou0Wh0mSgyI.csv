ou0Wh0mSgyI,231760,234080,managers on his way out here been in

ou0Wh0mSgyI,243920,245680,they're calling him out on the line
ou0Wh0mSgyI,245680,248319,drive so now you touch third base you
ou0Wh0mSgyI,248319,250400,touch the base runner and that should be
ou0Wh0mSgyI,250400,251599,a double play
ou0Wh0mSgyI,251599,252319,well
ou0Wh0mSgyI,252319,253599,they're going to say that the first base
ou0Wh0mSgyI,253599,255200,umpire did not say he caught it in the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,255200,255920,air
ou0Wh0mSgyI,255920,257919,sheldon's saying wait a minute that mark
ou0Wh0mSgyI,257919,259919,wagner put his hands up in the air to
ou0Wh0mSgyI,259919,262240,indicate the ball was caught and now the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,262240,264080,nats are running off the field they're
ou0Wh0mSgyI,264080,266000,going to bring all four umpires together
ou0Wh0mSgyI,266000,266720,to
ou0Wh0mSgyI,266720,269440,confer to see if the ball was indeed
ou0Wh0mSgyI,269440,271440,caught on the fly
ou0Wh0mSgyI,271440,273600,but if it was this is a double play and
ou0Wh0mSgyI,273600,276000,if it wasn't we had issues now
ou0Wh0mSgyI,276000,277840,i have no idea what's going on this is
ou0Wh0mSgyI,277840,280240,this managers are upset
ou0Wh0mSgyI,280240,281919,you don't see this very often both
ou0Wh0mSgyI,281919,284240,managers are upset with the call
ou0Wh0mSgyI,284240,286240,this is the rules check
ou0Wh0mSgyI,286240,288400,that the team cannot appeal after
ou0Wh0mSgyI,288400,289759,leaving the field
ou0Wh0mSgyI,289759,291520,wait wait wait a second so they're
ou0Wh0mSgyI,291520,293280,saying that because you sent them off
ou0Wh0mSgyI,293280,295520,the field because the nationals left the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,295520,298080,field of play put it in protest
ou0Wh0mSgyI,298080,301360,they're unable to check the rule as it's
ou0Wh0mSgyI,301360,302800,being enforced
ou0Wh0mSgyI,302800,304639,this is what i'm this is one of the more
ou0Wh0mSgyI,304639,305680,bizarre
ou0Wh0mSgyI,305680,308320,on-field rulings i've seen and we've had
ou0Wh0mSgyI,308320,310880,a few of them here right here
ou0Wh0mSgyI,310880,313840,josh bell grabs it and fires it to
ou0Wh0mSgyI,313840,316479,adrianza if adrian just steps on third
ou0Wh0mSgyI,316479,318560,that's just like your normal double play
ou0Wh0mSgyI,318560,319759,that you would have with a line out
ou0Wh0mSgyI,319759,322000,right but because he tagged the rise he
ou0Wh0mSgyI,322000,324400,tags the runner and the runner is now
ou0Wh0mSgyI,324400,327600,part of it he's live he cannot advance
ou0Wh0mSgyI,327600,329440,to third
ou0Wh0mSgyI,329440,331520,that kills everything now they stay on
ou0Wh0mSgyI,331520,333759,the field right here they step off now
ou0Wh0mSgyI,333759,336479,they fire to third and get the appeal
ou0Wh0mSgyI,336479,339919,that mitigates the run cam view
ou0Wh0mSgyI,339919,341680,to come on to face the left-handed
ou0Wh0mSgyI,341680,344560,hitting luis garcia and at least
ou0Wh0mSgyI,344560,347759,two other hitters after him
ou0Wh0mSgyI,347759,349680,as nelson cruz sends one up the middle
ou0Wh0mSgyI,349680,351919,off the body of hoy park and he can't
ou0Wh0mSgyI,351919,353440,make the play
ou0Wh0mSgyI,353440,356000,a leadoff walk to josh bell and an error
ou0Wh0mSgyI,356000,358000,by the pirate's second baseman
ou0Wh0mSgyI,358000,359600,and now the nats are threatening here in
ou0Wh0mSgyI,359600,362000,the fifth and so now derek shelton comes
ou0Wh0mSgyI,362000,363840,out to make a pitching change now
ou0Wh0mSgyI,363840,365680,they'll turn around k bear ruiz to the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,365680,367600,right side that's the match-up the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,367600,370319,pirates wanted
ou0Wh0mSgyI,370560,371680,up the middle
ou0Wh0mSgyI,371680,373520,and a nice read by josh bell out at
ou0Wh0mSgyI,373520,375600,second base the nationals after all of
ou0Wh0mSgyI,375600,377919,this craziness here in the fifth inning
ou0Wh0mSgyI,377919,380720,have nodded the score at four yachty has
ou0Wh0mSgyI,380720,382720,struck out swinging grounded into a five
ou0Wh0mSgyI,382720,384000,six three double play against the
ou0Wh0mSgyI,384000,386960,starter keller one to yadiel
ou0Wh0mSgyI,386960,388560,in the air right field
ou0Wh0mSgyI,388560,391120,moving back is madris looking up it's
ou0Wh0mSgyI,391120,394000,off the wall here comes nelson cruz he's
ou0Wh0mSgyI,394000,396639,going to score and the nats have bounced
ou0Wh0mSgyI,396639,399360,back from an incredibly bizarre ruling
ou0Wh0mSgyI,399360,401600,in the top of the fifth to take the lead
ou0Wh0mSgyI,401600,404080,in the bottom half
ou0Wh0mSgyI,404080,406240,a little bunt attempt by adrianza it's a
ou0Wh0mSgyI,406240,408479,fair ball the throw down the first
ou0Wh0mSgyI,408479,410639,baseman he wasn't at the base
ou0Wh0mSgyI,410639,413280,where bunning creates chaos
ou0Wh0mSgyI,413280,414960,well now they're loaded and that'll be
ou0Wh0mSgyI,414960,417440,it for cam view it's chase de young here
ou0Wh0mSgyI,417440,419440,in the fifth inning he's pitched so well
ou0Wh0mSgyI,419440,421360,he's gonna have to do well to get us out
ou0Wh0mSgyI,421360,423360,of this mess top of the order cesar
ou0Wh0mSgyI,423360,425120,hernandez will be the eighth man to back
ou0Wh0mSgyI,425120,427199,of the inning now the set of the pitch
ou0Wh0mSgyI,427199,429120,swing and a line drive to left that may
ou0Wh0mSgyI,429120,431280,fall it's a base hit
ou0Wh0mSgyI,431280,433199,one run is scored two men breaking for
ou0Wh0mSgyI,433199,435520,the plate to throw home the tag on one
ou0Wh0mSgyI,435520,438800,safe tag on the other is going to be out
ou0Wh0mSgyI,438800,440880,so cruz scores
ou0Wh0mSgyI,440880,443360,yadiel hernandez right behind him and
ou0Wh0mSgyI,443360,445840,the inning will be over on the out on
ou0Wh0mSgyI,445840,448000,the tag of the second runner cruz forgot
