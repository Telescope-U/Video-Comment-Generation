3cCM_dgQjf4,1024720,1030558,written momo  mo mo and then you are not in kathmandu  i'm sorry for you you did a mistake
3cCM_dgQjf4,1030558,1037280,because if you're in kathmandu you will  see momo everywhere it's over famous  here everyone hits momo right it's
3cCM_dgQjf4,1037280,1042400,it's part of the identity also of the  country so the mama is
3cCM_dgQjf4,1042400,1049360,a dumpling some way  it's a little bit confusing if it's  coming from tibet from china
3cCM_dgQjf4,1049360,1055600,or from nepal but if you look at the  let's say official history so it comes
3cCM_dgQjf4,1055600,1060720,from tibet where it was called the mug  mug  and
3cCM_dgQjf4,1060720,1066799,some nearby people  they were  merchants and making some trades
3cCM_dgQjf4,1066799,1073120,with uh with the tibetan people  and they found the mug mug  and they brought it back to nepal in
3cCM_dgQjf4,1073120,1078799,fact  they loved it they brought it back to  nepal and they called it the momo
3cCM_dgQjf4,1078799,1084080,momo in newari  means uh cooked by steaming so it makes
3cCM_dgQjf4,1084080,1089760,definitely sense so yeah let's try to  find some i mean let's try to find some  it's easy i mean i will do just 10
3cCM_dgQjf4,1089760,1095360,meters and i will find and  but mainly let's try to go inside the  kitchen

3cCM_dgQjf4,1655279,1662399,okay guys new place very important in  kathmandu this is pashu patinat temple  and pashupatinat is the place where
3cCM_dgQjf4,1662399,1668559,takes place the cremation of the dead  people you can see behind me  and pashupatinat is very important for
3cCM_dgQjf4,1668559,1673679,all the hindu people uh it's a very only  place for them i have to remind you that
3cCM_dgQjf4,1673679,1678720,eighty percent of the population in  nepal  is following hinduism
3cCM_dgQjf4,1678720,1685120,uh so the main the main ethnics are the  brahmin and the jetri and they are yeah  they are composing the majority of the
3cCM_dgQjf4,1685120,1693200,population that's why sometimes we we  heard that nepal was called the hindu  kingdom this place the pashupatinat
3cCM_dgQjf4,1693200,1698960,is yeah like i said very holy one legend  said that shiva himself and parvati one
3cCM_dgQjf4,1698960,1707279,day they they took the form the  appearance of antilops around here along  this river the bagmati river and
3cCM_dgQjf4,1707279,1714480,shiva  lost one of the horn you know when one  god was trying to to catch him to to to
3cCM_dgQjf4,1714480,1720000,ask him to take back his divine form you  know and he lost the he lost the own and
3cCM_dgQjf4,1720000,1726159,it was worshipped as a linga and  the shiva linga in fact and
3cCM_dgQjf4,1726159,1732000,centuries later one herzmann he saw  one of his cow
3cCM_dgQjf4,1732000,1738399,showering  the earth with milk and then he was  confused he started to dig and
3cCM_dgQjf4,1738399,1744000,he found the linga the linga of shiva  and that's the way
3cCM_dgQjf4,1744000,1749760,pashupatinath was born and after lots of  temple came and saw the cremation are
3cCM_dgQjf4,1749760,1757840,happening here because of the bagmati  river which is also very holy and so you  can understand that when the
3cCM_dgQjf4,1757840,1763600,bodies when the people are  gone the the ashes goes into the
3cCM_dgQjf4,1763600,1770440,into the bagmati river and then  swim for eternity
