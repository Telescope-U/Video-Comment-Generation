zEZYtxX0I-4,163920,170640,not willing to get it then you're gonna  starve you're gonna starve because  you're not hungry you're gonna starve
zEZYtxX0I-4,170640,176879,because you're not willing you're gonna  starve because you don't want it only  the hungry
zEZYtxX0I-4,176879,182400,knows how to eat  only the hungry  knows how to fight
zEZYtxX0I-4,182400,188080,you don't have time to step back  you got to go forward you got to push
zEZYtxX0I-4,188080,194560,harder you got to dig a little bit  deeper  some people  all they do
zEZYtxX0I-4,194560,200640,is talk  when you're in this place of business  there is no talking your only
zEZYtxX0I-4,200640,208319,conversation  is moving what's in front of you the  only conversation is pushing when you
zEZYtxX0I-4,208319,215840,feel you can't push the only  conversation is you against you
zEZYtxX0I-4,216239,222000,turn the lights on when i'm talking to  you because i said they didn't realize  that every setback of your life they
zEZYtxX0I-4,222000,228400,didn't realize that every bad day of  your life they didn't realize that every  sad day of your life they didn't realize
zEZYtxX0I-4,228400,233519,that every so-called failure disaster  missed opportunity a tragedy was just
zEZYtxX0I-4,233519,238799,the building block of strategy and the  agony the pain the heartache the misery
zEZYtxX0I-4,238799,243680,was put in place to give you the spirit  to rewrite history
zEZYtxX0I-4,243840,252280,therefore it should be no mystery when  you make a special delivery to the  doorsteps of victory
zEZYtxX0I-4,254000,259440,and you will  because you have been patiently waiting  for this moment cultivating and
zEZYtxX0I-4,259440,266800,calculating using the pain in your life  to derive the energy from what was once  a deprived and wasted synergy because
zEZYtxX0I-4,266800,273440,your own worst enemy has always been you  but no longer
zEZYtxX0I-4,273440,280240,the days that used to be sad and blue  are now giving way to the days of the  new you that has grown and grew to new
zEZYtxX0I-4,280240,284960,heights and clear skies that are sunny  and blue
zEZYtxX0I-4,285600,290800,you made the choice to clear your old  canvas  and with a fresh set of mental paint
zEZYtxX0I-4,290800,298720,brushes you drew your desired outcome  and took the necessary steps to make  sure it came true
zEZYtxX0I-4,298800,304880,for so long  you've known you had an inner beast  inside
zEZYtxX0I-4,305039,310479,but you were scared to bother it  for so long
zEZYtxX0I-4,310479,317199,you've known you had an inner beast  inside but you were scared to bother it
zEZYtxX0I-4,317680,323440,that's just like planting a seed and  then never watering it  never making sure it's provided with
zEZYtxX0I-4,323440,328479,exposure to sunlight basically just  squandering it
zEZYtxX0I-4,328800,334800,but that version of you no longer exists  because from the depths of your inner
zEZYtxX0I-4,334800,341039,soul  comes your inner beast and you are now  honoring it
zEZYtxX0I-4,341600,349120,that seed that was planted in your soul  has been patiently waiting  that seed that was planted in your heart
zEZYtxX0I-4,349120,358319,has been laying low for the perfect time  that seed that was planted in your  spirit has been storing energy
zEZYtxX0I-4,358479,364400,that seed that was planted in your  middle has been digesting and processing  and when all of these forces came
zEZYtxX0I-4,364400,371120,together they created the perfect storm  that set the stage for your inner beast  to be born that set the stage for your
zEZYtxX0I-4,371120,377680,inner beast to take form to set the  stage for your inner beast to transform  to set the stage for your inner beast to
zEZYtxX0I-4,377680,384639,break through and swarm like a large  group of bees and now you're ready to  see anyone that stands between you and
zEZYtxX0I-4,384639,391440,the stamp of greatness needed to make  your successful transformation official
zEZYtxX0I-4,391440,398400,so if you have any doubts left fizzy  because now you're locked in on your  target like a missile
zEZYtxX0I-4,398400,405039,wait a minute  make that a heat-seeking missile because  you're so hot that you sizzle and your
zEZYtxX0I-4,405039,411599,vision is so clear that it's crystal  you now realize that any limitations you

zEZYtxX0I-4,707200,713279,possibility that you have and understand  that it is not over for
zEZYtxX0I-4,714839,720399,you now is the moment  to start making your impact
zEZYtxX0I-4,720399,727410,when you want this thing as bad as you  want to breathe  that's when you find a way
zEZYtxX0I-4,727410,733839,[Music]  it's life's big myth
zEZYtxX0I-4,733839,740320,that you can get fit before committing  to something challenging  let me explain
zEZYtxX0I-4,740320,746000,we call it the spartan  paradox you must first commit to
zEZYtxX0I-4,746000,752079,something  and that forces you to do the work
zEZYtxX0I-4,752079,758639,with spartan we got seven million people  off the couch  by having them put a date on the
zEZYtxX0I-4,758639,766730,calendar  it's that simple  [Music]
zEZYtxX0I-4,767680,773370,once you put a date on the calendar  you get serious you become disciplined
zEZYtxX0I-4,773370,779440,[Music]  and if you don't  you get your ex kicked because that day
zEZYtxX0I-4,779440,785200,comes that event arrives with or without  you  [Music]
zEZYtxX0I-4,785200,792160,then what  then you're embarrassed  humiliated  and you want another crack at it
zEZYtxX0I-4,792160,798079,everyone everywhere i mean across 45  countries says to me  oh
zEZYtxX0I-4,798079,805600,first i'm going to get in shape first  i'm going to start eating healthy first  i'm going to get my lifestyle intact
zEZYtxX0I-4,805600,810720,no way  all the science all the data
zEZYtxX0I-4,810720,816480,all of our millions of conversations  across all these countries says
zEZYtxX0I-4,816480,824079,bullsh  you're just gonna procrastinate you're  not gonna do it  you end up talking yourself out of doing
zEZYtxX0I-4,824079,831680,the work  new year's resolutions don't work gym  memberships don't work diets don't work
zEZYtxX0I-4,831680,838160,the only thing that works  is a date  with something challenging on your
zEZYtxX0I-4,838160,844240,calendar  [Music]  so you want to find success  put a date on the calendar create a
zEZYtxX0I-4,844240,850079,deadline  force yourself to make the hard choices  daily  look
zEZYtxX0I-4,850079,855920,if humans didn't need deadlines schools  wouldn't need professors right  construction sites wouldn't need format
zEZYtxX0I-4,855920,862160,teams wouldn't need coaches  think about it you want to change  if you're ready
zEZYtxX0I-4,862160,868160,get a date on your calendar  you have to commit  you have to make it real it's a spartan
zEZYtxX0I-4,868160,873279,paradigm  [Music]
zEZYtxX0I-4,873279,878639,i think i could end it just like that  it's the spartan paradox that's it
zEZYtxX0I-4,881839,887920,the players that  had that passion  but
zEZYtxX0I-4,887920,893120,weren't willing to commit their entire  lives to doing that right it's a choice
zEZYtxX0I-4,893120,899040,right you have other things you have  family you have all these other things  you have to do the game can't really
zEZYtxX0I-4,899040,904399,be your number one priority  and so that's just looking at that like  man i'm
zEZYtxX0I-4,904399,909519,this is going to be fun  if i'm buddies with you from high school  if i'm a cousin of yours
zEZYtxX0I-4,909519,914880,what happened to our relationship how  did that gravitate when you went into  the league and you're you're determined
zEZYtxX0I-4,914880,920160,to become the greatest so you're  determined to become one the greatest  what happens to our relationship well it
zEZYtxX0I-4,920160,925279,suffers  it does suffer oh yeah okay yeah and you  understood that you were okay with that
zEZYtxX0I-4,925279,932399,well yeah and the people that love you  like friends and family like they know  that about you got it so they let you be
zEZYtxX0I-4,932399,939360,you  and when you reconvene  you know you pick back up where you left  off but make no mistake about it
zEZYtxX0I-4,939360,944639,everything in between  is lost  right so those long-term relationships
zEZYtxX0I-4,944639,951199,the commitment of time of  uh you know  taking vaca like i see a lot of players
zEZYtxX0I-4,951199,956320,take vacations with other players that  are close friends  and i'll just take vacations just to
zEZYtxX0I-4,956320,962720,take vacations or just hang out just to  hang out like i i'm not i never did that
zEZYtxX0I-4,962720,968480,why why didn't you do that well because  when i retire i didn't want to have to  say
