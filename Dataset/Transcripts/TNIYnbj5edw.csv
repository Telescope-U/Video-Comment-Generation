TNIYnbj5edw,1600,2880,If the truth be told
TNIYnbj5edw,5040,6880,and we were being totally honest
TNIYnbj5edw,9600,11120,most of us don't like waiting
TNIYnbj5edw,15360,19840,particularly if we're waiting for something  to change or something to get better
TNIYnbj5edw,22080,29840,waiting can be a very frustrating experience  but the worst kind of waiting of all
TNIYnbj5edw,32320,33440,is waiting on God
TNIYnbj5edw,35840,40960,when God forces you to wait for  things to get better in your life
TNIYnbj5edw,43280,50480,for things to improve to change to  reverse and nothing is happening
TNIYnbj5edw,52640,58879,and yet over and over and over and  over and over again in the bible  
TNIYnbj5edw,59600,64479,we're told to wait on the Lord the  most difficult place for you to be  
TNIYnbj5edw,66000,74320,in life is in God's waiting room in God's waiting  room some of you are in God's waiting room right  
TNIYnbj5edw,74320,82880,now what is God's waiting room when you're in a  hurry for something to happen and God isn't that's  
TNIYnbj5edw,83440,92240,God's waiting room some of you are in a hurry to  graduate some of you are in a hurry to get married  
TNIYnbj5edw,93520,100240,some of you are in a hurry to start a family some  of you are in a hurry to launch a new business  
TNIYnbj5edw,101840,109359,to to close a big deal some of you in a hurry  for a big goal a big dream a big accomplishment  
TNIYnbj5edw,109360,117440,some of you are in a hurry for all kinds of  different things and God isn't we as human beings  
TNIYnbj5edw,117440,121200,hate to wait and we especially  struggle with waiting on God  
TNIYnbj5edw,122320,127200,have you ever been in a hurry when  God wasn't and your God I know you're  
TNIYnbj5edw,127200,131840,going to come through and I'm praying this  really Godly prayer I know it's your will  
TNIYnbj5edw,131840,135440,so where are you why aren't you coming  through and you're in the waiting room of life  
TNIYnbj5edw,137440,144400,and we get so impatient we want to hurry God up  and we want things right now and some of you've  
TNIYnbj5edw,144400,148000,been waiting for God to come through and you're  about to give up and you're getting discouraged  
TNIYnbj5edw,148560,155680,and you realize that God's standard time is  not always running on my time and it's in the  
TNIYnbj5edw,155680,160799,waiting rooms of life we learn to trust God the  most in those difficult waiting rooms of life  
TNIYnbj5edw,160800,166560,that's where God grows us and builds our character  the most through the pain of waiting we learn to  
TNIYnbj5edw,166560,171680,trust God and without faith it's impossible to  please God that's when he builds our character  
TNIYnbj5edw,172960,178160,you see while you're working on your project your  goal your dream your vision God's working on you  
TNIYnbj5edw,178960,182400,and God's much more interested in you  than in what you're trying to accomplish  
TNIYnbj5edw,182960,187200,because you're not taking your accomplishments  to heaven but you are taking your character  
TNIYnbj5edw,188480,192560,and sometimes God says yeah I intend to give you  what I've promised you I intend to answer that  
TNIYnbj5edw,192560,199120,prayer I intend to fulfill the vision but you're  not ready yet I want you to grow and when you're  
TNIYnbj5edw,199120,204640,ready then it's going to happen a lot of times we  think we're waiting on God for something to happen  
TNIYnbj5edw,204640,211600,like a prayer to be answered God says you're not  waiting on me I'm waiting on you I'm trying to  
TNIYnbj5edw,211600,217120,prepare you I'm testing your faith will you trust  me but I'm also trying to grow you up because the  
TNIYnbj5edw,217120,221440,blessing I want to give you so much bigger than  you can handle right now you're not ready for  
TNIYnbj5edw,221440,228800,it you can't handle it yet another thing you have  to learn in life is that a delay is not a denial  
TNIYnbj5edw,229680,238319,there's a big difference between no and not yet  now immature children don't know the difference  
TNIYnbj5edw,238320,243200,you tell a kid not yet they start crying and  having a hissy fit because they think it means no  
TNIYnbj5edw,244000,251760,they don't understand a delay is not a denial  God is saying I I intend to do these things in  
TNIYnbj5edw,251760,256320,your life that I've given you the vision the  dream to do but you're just not ready yet and  
TNIYnbj5edw,257600,263840,at the right time I will answer your prayer God's  often waiting on us now why is this important  
TNIYnbj5edw,264960,270160,because when you're in God's waiting room you  fall temptation to all kinds of negative emotions  
TNIYnbj5edw,270880,276880,you start worrying you start stressing out you get  anxious you get irritable you get spiritual add  
TNIYnbj5edw,276880,282480,you can get envious you can get jealous hey  he got a promotion I didn't get the promotion  
TNIYnbj5edw,283600,288960,that she's having a baby I'm not having a  baby she got engaged I didn't get engaged  
TNIYnbj5edw,290160,296080,he's starting a new business that's taken off  what about mine and and all these kind of negative  
TNIYnbj5edw,296080,301360,emotions can come in to your life and then you get  frustrated and then you start having a pity party  
TNIYnbj5edw,302960,308400,so what does God want you to do when you're  in the waiting room of life and because you're  
TNIYnbj5edw,308400,314000,going to go through it many many times God is not  a vending machine where you put in the prayer and  
TNIYnbj5edw,314000,319440,then you pull the thing and you instantly get it  there's always a delay the delays are by design  
TNIYnbj5edw,320560,326960,the delays are by design to teach you to trust  him and to grow up in your character hey a delay  
TNIYnbj5edw,326960,333120,is not a denial there's a big difference between  no and not yet for those of your parents you  
TNIYnbj5edw,333120,339360,understand this there's a big difference between  telling your kids no and not yet it's just not  
TNIYnbj5edw,339360,348719,time yet and a delay is not a denial we see it all  through scriptures God told Noah to build a boat  
TNIYnbj5edw,348720,353680,that would save his family from a great flood but  it didn't rain for 120 years God told Abraham he'd  
TNIYnbj5edw,353680,358240,be the father of a great nation but he didn't  have his first child until he was 99 years old  
TNIYnbj5edw,359040,363360,God told Moses that he would lead the people  out of slavery from Egypt they'd been in for  
TNIYnbj5edw,363360,368319,over 450 years but then God sends Moses  out into the desert for 40 years to wait  
TNIYnbj5edw,369680,375520,God gives Joseph this great dream that he'll save  his family and his people from famine and he'll  
TNIYnbj5edw,375520,381280,be a great leader but then Joseph gets sold into  slavery he gets falsely accused and imprisoned  
TNIYnbj5edw,381280,387680,and he's waiting there in prison until finally God  takes him from prison and positions him second in  
TNIYnbj5edw,387680,396240,command in all of Egypt and the promise comes true  King David God had King David anointed as king  
TNIYnbj5edw,396240,403199,but he didn't really get to be king until years  later even Jesus Christ spent his first 30 years  
TNIYnbj5edw,403200,410400,waiting in a carpentry shop before he started  his earthly ministry see a delay is not a denial  
TNIYnbj5edw,412320,420400,When God delays sometimes we feel forgotten Psalm  13:1 says how long o Lord will you forget me  
TNIYnbj5edw,420400,427600,forever you come to a point sometimes of believing  that God has forgotten you don't worry it's a  
TNIYnbj5edw,427600,433840,common experience we all go through it one  time or another feeling that God isn't there  
TNIYnbj5edw,433840,439760,or at the very least he's forgotten us perhaps  our problems aren't important to him we imagine  
TNIYnbj5edw,439760,445360,the Psalmist encounters those very doubts in Psalm  chapter 10 and verse 1 here's what he says there  
TNIYnbj5edw,446240,454720,why do you stand afar off oh Lord why do you hide  in times of trouble what you believe is that he  
TNIYnbj5edw,454720,461440,has given up on you you may even be feeling that  way right now if so please allow me to remind you  
TNIYnbj5edw,462000,468480,that what you're contemplating is a simple  impossibility God never gives up on you  
TNIYnbj5edw,469040,473840,he never ceases to care about you and  he will not abandon his work on you  
TNIYnbj5edw,473840,480960,of which your trial is a part he even says that  your name is written on the palms of his hands  
TNIYnbj5edw,481600,488560,your very name is tattooed on the palms of God's  hands it is engraved there it cannot be removed  
TNIYnbj5edw,488560,495440,and such is God's concern for you he cannot forget  you no matter what storm you're weathering now  
TNIYnbj5edw,495440,502400,you have never left God's mind or his heart  yes sometimes when God delays we feel forgotten  
TNIYnbj5edw,503600,510880,but God never delays without a purpose he knows  you he knows your heart he knows everything  
TNIYnbj5edw,510880,518240,you're asking him for if he's not doing what you  think he should do just be patient because God  
TNIYnbj5edw,518240,524320,loves you don't forget he's got your name  tattooed on his palm he knows who you are  
TNIYnbj5edw,524320,531360,he hasn't forgotten and he never will often God's  timing disappoints us you know there's something  
TNIYnbj5edw,531360,536959,maybe something you've been praying about for  a long time and you really you need an answer  
TNIYnbj5edw,537840,542080,you know maybe you've been praying for  something really specific and you needed  
TNIYnbj5edw,542080,549040,God to show up within a particular time frame  you know it's an urgent need and he doesn't  
TNIYnbj5edw,550320,556640,when God doesn't answer when you need him  to I wonder what conclusions do you come to  
TNIYnbj5edw,557680,563360,do you think to yourself you know did I  do something wrong did I ask the wrong way  
TNIYnbj5edw,564160,570639,do you find yourself asking does God  even hear my prayers so often we think  
TNIYnbj5edw,570640,578480,when God doesn't answer in our way or in our time  that it's because he doesn't love us God loves you  
TNIYnbj5edw,578480,585440,he doesn't love anybody else one grain of  sand more than he loves you you know in those  
TNIYnbj5edw,585440,593440,darkest moments of life I want you to hear Jesus  looking right through your fear and saying to you  
TNIYnbj5edw,593440,600880,trust me I am right here God's timing might not  have been everything you hoped for in your life  
TNIYnbj5edw,600880,606080,but I hope you understand that you can  trust the one who keeps the time clock  
TNIYnbj5edw,607280,614240,We don't like to trust somebody else's  timing why because if we lose control
TNIYnbj5edw,616560,626400,and so we'd rather then trust God because trusting  God means my goodness I actually have to trust God  
TNIYnbj5edw,626960,631840,we'd rather go listen I like the plan and purpose  you have for my life but can we do it my way  
TNIYnbj5edw,633360,641600,and here's the funny thing now that I'm a parent  I recognize in my children that they don't like it  
TNIYnbj5edw,641600,648959,to wait on my timing they don't like to wait  they don't like to chill and be patient but the  
TNIYnbj5edw,648960,656000,thing is if they would just trust my timing  they would recognize it's for their good  
TNIYnbj5edw,657280,668560,it's for them to be blessed and prosperous and so  you can live life frustrated anxious stressed out  
TNIYnbj5edw,668560,676160,angry or you can rest and go God I have to trust  in your timing just trust his timing why because  
TNIYnbj5edw,676160,681680,it'll give you peace it'll give you rest and it  will help you to remove all disappointment and  
TNIYnbj5edw,681680,686080,hurt and bitterness from your heart because  you'll know actually God's in control of my life
TNIYnbj5edw,687840,691040,Why didn't God just tell you everything that's  going to happen in your life right up front
TNIYnbj5edw,693600,697040,well I think there are two or three reasons first  it would overwhelm you probably scare you to death  
TNIYnbj5edw,698720,703920,but the real reason God doesn't announce his  timetable to you is he wants you to trust him  
TNIYnbj5edw,705280,710080,he says just live one day at a time trust me I  I'm a good God I'm a loving God everything I do  
TNIYnbj5edw,710080,716960,in your life is for love but you just got to trust  me in acts chapter 1 in the bible the bible says  
TNIYnbj5edw,716960,724000,this Jesus said in verse 7 you don't get to  know the time timing is the father's business  
TNIYnbj5edw,724640,729040,so you're just not ever going to know stuff in  advance you don't know what's going to happen  
TNIYnbj5edw,729040,735600,tomorrow in your life much less the rest of your  life God does not tell us the details in advance  
TNIYnbj5edw,737040,741839,he has a timetable for your life but  he doesn't tell you the details in  
TNIYnbj5edw,741840,749280,advance if you could understand why God does  everything God does you'd be God God's timing  
TNIYnbj5edw,749920,757680,isn't good it's perfect because he knows all the  details he knows past present future he knows what  
TNIYnbj5edw,757680,765839,we need what we want what's the wisest thing to do  you can never go wrong waiting upon God's timing  
TNIYnbj5edw,767520,773200,If I'm going to wait upon God I've got to trust  him because my waiting is saying I'm trusting  
TNIYnbj5edw,773200,780080,you God that your timing is better than mine you  know what I do not know your time is always right  
TNIYnbj5edw,780720,786560,and so I'm going to trust you and I'm going to  wait till you give me permission to go there or  
TNIYnbj5edw,786560,792240,do this or have that or buy the other it isn't  that God's trying to deprive us of anything  
TNIYnbj5edw,792960,798640,he only wants what is best for us so it  takes faith and what I mean by that is  
TNIYnbj5edw,798640,804560,simply this am I willing to trust God  for his timing before I make a decision  
TNIYnbj5edw,806560,816000,Just imagine how amazing life would be if we could  trust God all the time in every thing all the time  
TNIYnbj5edw,816880,824960,in every thing and trusting God means that we  stop trying to make things happen ourselves  
TNIYnbj5edw,826240,829120,and we wait on God how many love waiting
TNIYnbj5edw,831600,838880,we wait on God it's a painful word even to say it  and God doesn't do it when we'd like him to or the  
TNIYnbj5edw,838880,846560,way we'd like him to but I can promise you today  if you will keep your eyes on God and trust him  
TNIYnbj5edw,846560,854000,to be your recompense and to be your reward and to  be your vindicator you will get double blessings  
TNIYnbj5edw,854000,858960,for your former trouble trusting him doesn't  mean I'm going to get what I want when I want it  
TNIYnbj5edw,859520,866320,trusting him says I believe that when the timing  is right God will provide what I'm asking him for  
TNIYnbj5edw,867760,875760,you know broken hearts do mend bodies do healed  disappointment turns into new dreams and the end  
TNIYnbj5edw,875760,880960,of one thing can open the door for something  new if we will just put our trust in God  
TNIYnbj5edw,881520,884720,you know what if you're still here on  the planet God's got a plan for you  
TNIYnbj5edw,886480,892639,it seems to you like God's forgotten all about  you well he hasn't he hears you and he sees you  
TNIYnbj5edw,893200,898400,can I tell you today that you're not invisible God  knows exactly where you're at and he knows exactly  
TNIYnbj5edw,898400,903360,what's going on in your life and he knows exactly  how much you can take and how much you can't take  
TNIYnbj5edw,903360,909600,and he may not be early but he won't be late  God's timing is always perfect do I believe  
TNIYnbj5edw,910320,914800,that he has our best interest at heart  if I believe that I'm going to wait  
TNIYnbj5edw,915840,925840,but watch this somebody says I don't have any time  to waste you never waste time waiting on God never  
TNIYnbj5edw,926880,931668,you always find out that his  timing is always the right time
