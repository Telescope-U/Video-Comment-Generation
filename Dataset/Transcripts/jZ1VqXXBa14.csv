jZ1VqXXBa14,14960,20640,episode of ctxp where we answer  questions about motorcycling that nobody
jZ1VqXXBa14,20640,26160,asked on today's episode we've got two  players duking it out to determine which
jZ1VqXXBa14,26160,31679,one is faster sport bikes or sport  touring bikes let's meet the contestants
jZ1VqXXBa14,31679,38160,first up it's the internet's favorite  sport bike bro he likes to do rolling  burnouts in your neighborhood at 2am
jZ1VqXXBa14,38160,44960,everybody give a round of applause to  barry henning  real proud to be here representing best
jZ1VqXXBa14,44960,50079,motorcycles on the planet sport bikes um  i do appreciate this show ctxp i did
jZ1VqXXBa14,50079,55680,hear that uh i could potentially win a  free set of slicks which would be great  going riding with the bros this weekend
jZ1VqXXBa14,55680,60800,and you know it's just like i always  said and it's just like the sticker on  my windscreen if you're not riding a
jZ1VqXXBa14,60800,66720,redline you're not living right go sport  bikes  all right barry does sound very fast but
jZ1VqXXBa14,66720,73600,he has some stiff competition and i mean  that literally it's a geriatric  adrenaline junkie representing teams
jZ1VqXXBa14,73600,79040,sport touring everybody jack courts  thanks for having me bob do appreciate
jZ1VqXXBa14,79040,84960,it i just like fast bikes i always have  always will i think um and i just like
jZ1VqXXBa14,84960,91520,that my hands to be warm from some  heated grips wind protection luggage for  some for some layers if it gets chilly i
jZ1VqXXBa14,91520,97840,think other people probably understand  that  and a little more comfort from my back  after that construction accident
jZ1VqXXBa14,97840,105280,really got to me  but again thanks for having me i just  said like to say hello to my brother  steve in the audience i think
jZ1VqXXBa14,108240,115840,all right sounds like a fierce  competition on our hands so let's get  down to it let's play
jZ1VqXXBa14,116750,121980,[Applause]
jZ1VqXXBa14,121980,125669,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,135840,142879,some people think that sport touring  bikes are big and heavy and well kind of  lame but nowadays you can actually get
jZ1VqXXBa14,142879,150480,some pretty freaking fast sport touring  machines a few are even built around the  engines and or chassis of actual
jZ1VqXXBa14,150480,156800,superbikes so  that makes us wonder  just how quick are they
jZ1VqXXBa14,156800,163840,what we have here are three examples of  modern sport touring motorcycles all  related to superbikes in one way or
jZ1VqXXBa14,163840,171079,another  kawasaki's ninja 1000 sx
jZ1VqXXBa14,171519,175239,bmw's s1000xr
jZ1VqXXBa14,177440,181959,and aprilius tuono v4
jZ1VqXXBa14,184239,191920,what we're going to do is find out just  how well these bikes perform by way of a  top speed test a quarter mile drag race
jZ1VqXXBa14,191920,198000,and a good old-fashioned lap time  showdown at a racetrack  and to keep these overweight wannabes
jZ1VqXXBa14,198000,204130,honest we have also brought out  kawasaki's zx10r a proper superbike
jZ1VqXXBa14,204130,210400,[Music]  we'll run it through the same test to
jZ1VqXXBa14,210400,217040,see how fast it is and use it as a  yardstick to determine if modern sport  touring bikes can actually hold a candle
jZ1VqXXBa14,217040,222879,to a modern sport bike  there you have it everybody four bikes
jZ1VqXXBa14,222879,230400,three tests two bros  one winner  first up wfo
jZ1VqXXBa14,233280,239439,this is highway 26 in new mexico  aka the long straight stretch of road we
jZ1VqXXBa14,239439,246640,convinced the police to shut down so we  could take our fire breathing machines  to the top of sixth gear
jZ1VqXXBa14,246720,252640,this region is famous for its hot  chilies  today however we were cooking with a
jZ1VqXXBa14,252640,260160,different kind of heat  up first the ninja 1000 sx
jZ1VqXXBa14,264400,267840,hey guys am i good to go
jZ1VqXXBa14,272000,274479,thank you
jZ1VqXXBa14,280479,287840,okay kids 138 horsepower  of ninja 1000  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,287840,294880,here we go  we're already at 110  115 120.
jZ1VqXXBa14,295040,303599,shift light in fifth year  we're in sixth gear  we are at  136 miles an hour
jZ1VqXXBa14,304240,310000,15 seconds in and i was already going  twice the 65 mile an hour speed limit
jZ1VqXXBa14,310000,314638,things were looking good  until
jZ1VqXXBa14,317520,323680,what the was that  something just flew off the bike  maybe a saddle bag i have no idea but he
jZ1VqXXBa14,323680,331759,does not seem to have noticed  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,340400,347120,are you only showing us that side of the  bike for a reason  did i lose the saddlebag yeah
jZ1VqXXBa14,347120,352960,do you have a good track record with you  in luggage zach how did that happen  as soon as you clicked into sixth
jZ1VqXXBa14,352960,358960,it came off and like  went off into the  in the gill weed so we get to do the  whole thing where we walk down the side
jZ1VqXXBa14,358960,365280,of the road and look for luggage again  yeah that's cool uh and while we're at  it  sorry
jZ1VqXXBa14,365680,370960,we'll kawasaki for that  ah yes
jZ1VqXXBa14,370960,376800,the quest for missing luggage  if you're playing ctxp bingo
jZ1VqXXBa14,376800,385440,take a drink  after a brief stint of testing the ninja  1000's off-road chops
jZ1VqXXBa14,385600,394520,i found the luggage carcass  and returned to base with my tail and a  saddle bag between my legs
jZ1VqXXBa14,395919,403120,it turns out someone forgot to latch the  ninja's luggage  so we blamed it on the camera crew like
jZ1VqXXBa14,403120,409360,we always do  then we fixed the issue using our keen  scientific minds
jZ1VqXXBa14,409360,414479,and lined up for another run  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,414479,421759,okay  here we go again  1043 cc's of sport touring
jZ1VqXXBa14,421759,431669,hopefully with two saddle packs  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,432240,437840,100 miles an hour  [Music]  120
jZ1VqXXBa14,438080,443280,sixth gear  showing 141
jZ1VqXXBa14,443280,451120,on the gps 142  happy report i did not see any items  come off the ninja 1000 sx so far so
jZ1VqXXBa14,451120,457440,good  151  152
jZ1VqXXBa14,457440,459680,oh
jZ1VqXXBa14,463360,466879,wow the gopro's falling off
jZ1VqXXBa14,471039,475800,all right  ninja 1000
jZ1VqXXBa14,476040,482639,[Music]  still got both bags that's a good sign
jZ1VqXXBa14,482639,488080,went so fast i peeled the gopro off i  mean it turns out top speed testing is  like pretty detrimental to equipment
jZ1VqXXBa14,488080,493680,it's rigorous did you go any faster that  time or  the second saddlebag cost about
jZ1VqXXBa14,493680,498960,four miles an hour i think um  it's probably worth being able to carry  an extra two days worth of clothes
jZ1VqXXBa14,498960,504800,though  having finally clocked a legitimate  speed on the ninja 1000 we let traffic
jZ1VqXXBa14,504800,510720,go by and i moved on to the next bike  stepping up the ladder
jZ1VqXXBa14,510720,517279,going from about 138 horsepower to 165  and 10 000 more dollars of msrp it's
jZ1VqXXBa14,517279,524000,pretty remarkable how expensive that bmw  is but it is laden with pretty much  everything you can get in the motorhead  catalog including heated grips you're
jZ1VqXXBa14,524000,532360,gonna turn those on i might as well turn  them on they're there right  i think that's gonna go a lot faster
jZ1VqXXBa14,536959,542080,all right you bavarian beauty  let's see what you got
jZ1VqXXBa14,542720,548399,s1000xr  this is the beating heart  of the s1000 s1000rr after all which is
jZ1VqXXBa14,548399,556320,bmw superbike  and we're already going 100 miles an  hour  now we're going 120.
jZ1VqXXBa14,556320,562000,now we're going 130.  the s1000 sounds faster i think with
jZ1VqXXBa14,562000,567760,open stretch like this  165  we kind of had a theory that some of
jZ1VqXXBa14,567760,573760,these bikes might actually go faster in  fifth and sixth just because of the  gearing so if it's not tacked out in six
jZ1VqXXBa14,573760,579360,if it's not actually going against the  limiter we decided we would try  downshifting the fifth
jZ1VqXXBa14,580640,586880,we're losing speed in sixth gear  come on come on go go go
jZ1VqXXBa14,587920,595519,this is just like valkyrbonne very very  fast  look at it go
jZ1VqXXBa14,596440,603130,157 miles an hour  all right  that's it
jZ1VqXXBa14,603130,608480,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,608480,613519,that sounded faster we could hear you  holding it wide open for it sounded like  30 seconds
jZ1VqXXBa14,613519,619440,what'd you hit it's pretty wild 157  miles an hour all right yeah so
jZ1VqXXBa14,619440,624880,what what do we say the ninja was 152  which i would have thought it was going  to be a bigger delta than that this bike
jZ1VqXXBa14,624880,630720,fuels so fast  up to  120 miles an hour agreed yeah like it
jZ1VqXXBa14,630720,637200,just pulls so hard but it's just tall  and wide and top speed's all about  horsepower versus frontal area could you
jZ1VqXXBa14,637200,642640,feel it pushing against the wind was it  really is it really struggling to take  off those final miles per hour yep well
jZ1VqXXBa14,642640,648640,we've got you've still got the aprilia  which has uh more power and is much  smaller so potentially faster
jZ1VqXXBa14,648640,655600,i gotta say i'm looking forward to it's  pretty fun to go as fast as you can  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,655760,660800,the tuono has a huge engine and  comically small luggage that's a good
jZ1VqXXBa14,660800,669240,recipe for a fast sport touring machine  and zach's best shot for competing with  the zx10 superbike
jZ1VqXXBa14,669910,676560,[Music]  happens for the best of us
jZ1VqXXBa14,676560,679880,you're excited
jZ1VqXXBa14,689880,696160,175 horsepower  smallest saddlebags  biggest engine
jZ1VqXXBa14,696160,702560,let's see what we got  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,702560,711160,oh  [Music]  there is not a better sounding engine on  the planet as far as i'm concerned
jZ1VqXXBa14,716800,722079,sixth gear wide open on a  1077 cc v4 that's probably pretty
jZ1VqXXBa14,722079,727760,thrilling  i gotta touch down even more
jZ1VqXXBa14,727760,734880,i can only see the gps  i can barely see the road  164
jZ1VqXXBa14,735680,741480,12 000 rpm  six here 173.
jZ1VqXXBa14,743410,750930,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,751360,756480,feel alive oh  i feel very alive i feel like i just  took a b12 shot
jZ1VqXXBa14,756480,762320,i mean the sound of it just it wide open  for that long  you're holding it there for you can hear  it all the way from here oh yeah
jZ1VqXXBa14,762320,770480,absolutely you can hear it long before  you can see it that's wicked so  faster than the s1000xr 173
jZ1VqXXBa14,770480,776639,miles per hour on the gps are you  serious 173 that is no joke man i did
jZ1VqXXBa14,776639,782959,not expect that out of the 200 way to go  it's got the high handlebar the little  screen and the cell phone it's
jZ1VqXXBa14,782959,788480,definitely pushing the envelope of what  a sport touring bike is but hey  wow
jZ1VqXXBa14,788480,795360,if you need a heavy dose of sport with  your light dose of touring toronto's got  it that is remarkable so small saddle
jZ1VqXXBa14,795360,800720,bags  not very good range small windscreen but  boy it'll blow your hair back if you
jZ1VqXXBa14,800720,807120,want to go fast heck yeah  all right well that's going to give the  zx10 a run for the money i really didn't  think it was going to register that high
jZ1VqXXBa14,807120,814639,i'm very impressed yeah  i didn't expect to be nervous but i am a
jZ1VqXXBa14,814639,820079,little bit after watching zach  rage up and down the road  and now there's all this
jZ1VqXXBa14,820079,826480,all this expectation the zx10 is gonna  go so fast and i think it will and  frankly i guess that's what i'm a little
jZ1VqXXBa14,826480,831839,intimidated by but ultimately i'm  excited i got a high hopes for this  thing getting into the 180s
jZ1VqXXBa14,831839,838560,we just gotta wait for them to get the  last of the trucks off the road i get to  fire this thing down the line
jZ1VqXXBa14,838800,844880,thank you  all righty we got kawasaki's zx10 ninja
jZ1VqXXBa14,844880,850320,here  35 more horsepower  than the xr
jZ1VqXXBa14,850320,856560,25 more horsepower  than the aprilia and a whole lot less  frontal area let's see what 200
jZ1VqXXBa14,856560,859279,horsepower does
jZ1VqXXBa14,863920,869199,oh man that accelerates fast  already going 120.
jZ1VqXXBa14,869199,878160,oh my god  pulling so hard still 160.
jZ1VqXXBa14,878160,881399,there's 172.
jZ1VqXXBa14,885010,890660,[Music]  wow
jZ1VqXXBa14,890660,893759,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,906320,913279,at this point in the video  everyone watching knows how fast you  just went  but i don't i just saw a lot of my life
jZ1VqXXBa14,913279,919800,flash before my eyes  all the way against the limiter in sixth  gear for at least 30 seconds at a steady
jZ1VqXXBa14,919800,927120,181 miles an hour wow it showed 189  on the dash 181 at gps but i had lots of
jZ1VqXXBa14,927120,933920,time to confirm it because it was just  and that was rev limiter 6 gear yep  lights flashing at me just steady at 181
jZ1VqXXBa14,933920,941040,wow i got  i got pretty scared because it's  literally revving as high as it can  going as fast as it can and i'm just
jZ1VqXXBa14,941040,946880,like is the drain plug tight like is a  tire going to explode  yeah man
jZ1VqXXBa14,946880,952399,the bar has been set 181 for a top speed  181 and what was the toronto again 173
jZ1VqXXBa14,952399,957680,72 72 73 not a huge delta huge delta you  know if we just had sprockets with more
jZ1VqXXBa14,957680,963120,gearing for this bike probably go faster  probably not up against the wind you're  up against the limiter exactly
jZ1VqXXBa14,963120,968639,interesting interesting limited not  limited by aerodynamics but  you know we're testing them showroom
jZ1VqXXBa14,968639,976720,stock because this is the the bikes that  people purchased 181's probably fast  enough for the vast majority of humanity
jZ1VqXXBa14,977120,982160,with that pearl of wisdom from arie the  first test was in the books and the
jZ1VqXXBa14,982160,988000,score was super bikes one sport touring  bikes zero
jZ1VqXXBa14,990390,996399,[Music]  my next chance at redemption on team
jZ1VqXXBa14,996399,1002399,sport touring is a quarter mile drag  race and you're supposed to do that  under sort of you know very calm
jZ1VqXXBa14,1002399,1008480,conditions unfortunately we've got about  a 20 mile an hour tailwind on the drag  strip plus some technical difficulties
jZ1VqXXBa14,1008480,1014800,we do have a pretty sophisticated gps  equipment for recording elapsed time and  peak miles per hour however it's on the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1014800,1020399,fritz so we're gonna abandon that we're  gonna go old school we're just gonna go  head to head like anyone else would from
jZ1VqXXBa14,1020399,1026240,a stoplight whoever gets to the end of  the quarter mile first is going to be  the winner i assume that will be me on
jZ1VqXXBa14,1026240,1032240,the zx10  he does have more horsepower still and  less weight still that has not changed
jZ1VqXXBa14,1032240,1038449,but testing is testing so up first ninja  v ninja on the quarter mile
jZ1VqXXBa14,1038449,1043600,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1043600,1050840,we're gonna do a three two one go  three two one go no jumpsies  i'll call it
jZ1VqXXBa14,1050840,1056400,okay  this is a practice three two one go it's  gonna go three two
jZ1VqXXBa14,1056400,1060880,one  go  copy
jZ1VqXXBa14,1061919,1067080,three  two  one go
jZ1VqXXBa14,1067080,1071430,[Applause]  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1077120,1084240,[Music]  no big surprise the ninja 1000 didn't  stand a chance against its big brother
jZ1VqXXBa14,1084240,1089919,with 60 more pounds and 60 fewer horses  ninjas bagus is built for comfort more
jZ1VqXXBa14,1089919,1097120,than speed  bavarius rapidous however is built for  both
jZ1VqXXBa14,1102570,1108580,[Music]  they rock and roll i am adequately  prepared to rock
jZ1VqXXBa14,1108580,1114400,[Music]  three  two
jZ1VqXXBa14,1114400,1121520,one  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1121520,1126759,oh go he's getting away again  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1127679,1133280,as soon as you got to the top of first  gear and into second gear it was game  over it's absolute torture on the clutch
jZ1VqXXBa14,1133280,1140400,of this machine to do that but once i  get to second gear this thing is such a  rocket  i mean i'm seeing 146 miles an hour by
jZ1VqXXBa14,1140400,1145760,the time i go past the cone  yeah that's at least 10 or 15 miles an  hour faster than what i'm seeing
jZ1VqXXBa14,1145760,1151840,fairly easy win for the zx10  but zach is now transferring over to  tuono i don't want to say that i'm
jZ1VqXXBa14,1151840,1157840,scared but  i'm a little nervous  mary henny you shaking in them shoes
jZ1VqXXBa14,1157840,1163919,not quite  my toes are tingling a little bit maybe  the big difference with the tuono is
jZ1VqXXBa14,1163919,1171600,that it only weighs a little bit more  than the zx10 instead of weighing a lot  more than the zx10 plus you know the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1171600,1177840,torque of the v4 biggest engine here  could be good it could make a difference  we don't know we don't know till we test
jZ1VqXXBa14,1177840,1183360,that's why we do it that's why we test  that's why i roll up to the stoplight  and we get it on
jZ1VqXXBa14,1184020,1190080,[Music]  sport touring's last hope
jZ1VqXXBa14,1190080,1197360,[Music]  doing this one for barry henning  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1197360,1203080,three  two  one go
jZ1VqXXBa14,1203080,1208910,[Music]  oh man
jZ1VqXXBa14,1208910,1215200,[Music]  the 60 foot you definitely got me you
jZ1VqXXBa14,1215200,1221600,got a solid start yeah it's got that  street bike uh gearing you know the zx10  is geared so tall but
jZ1VqXXBa14,1221600,1227039,you know how we learned that the engine  is electronically limited in first and  second gear to flatten the torque curve
jZ1VqXXBa14,1227039,1233200,yep  i swear to god that's hurting the bike  because i can't rip first gear out and  let it actually stretch its legs i have
jZ1VqXXBa14,1233200,1240080,to short sift to second to get slightly  more torque and then by the time oddly  that it's in third or fourth gear it's
jZ1VqXXBa14,1240080,1245840,like almost hanging tight yeah that's a  huge disappointment about that bike that  they somehow electronically limited the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1245840,1252240,torque output in first and second i mean  if you're buying a 1077 cc  monster of a machine like you want all
jZ1VqXXBa14,1252240,1257919,the horsepower it's got trash control  it's got ride mode so like you think it  would have made the difference i don't
jZ1VqXXBa14,1257919,1264960,know if i could actually have done it  but i think it would have been closer  sport bikes prevailed yet again even
jZ1VqXXBa14,1264960,1271039,with the gnarliest saddlebagged  motorcycle  that we could find so that's that's two
jZ1VqXXBa14,1271039,1277840,for team sport bike  i've really only got  one more chance
jZ1VqXXBa14,1278750,1284400,[Music]  having lost the first two rounds of this
jZ1VqXXBa14,1284400,1289600,fight things weren't looking good  however we agreed the final battle was
jZ1VqXXBa14,1289600,1294640,the most important  here's the thing  the first two tests are all about
jZ1VqXXBa14,1294640,1300080,horsepower and weight and acceleration  horsepower and horsepower exactly so
jZ1VqXXBa14,1300080,1305600,this racetrack situation is a different  ball game people we got left turns we  got right turns we got breaking we got
jZ1VqXXBa14,1305600,1312000,bumps it's the whole package the whole  performance pack it's representative of  performance in a way that i'm very
jZ1VqXXBa14,1312000,1317679,comfortable leaning into right now  before the test happens perhaps less so  afterward the point is
jZ1VqXXBa14,1317679,1323840,because his bike says racing on the side  of it several places in several places i  have voted area to go first on the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1323840,1330080,racing motorcycle at the racetrack to  set a benchmark time that the sport  touring brakes have to beat and while i  was at it i also voted while he was not
jZ1VqXXBa14,1330080,1335760,looking for him to explain to you how  the test will work seems appropriate and  i am happy to
jZ1VqXXBa14,1335760,1341360,so we've got this wonderful little  racetrack closed down all to ourselves  and we're going to give ourselves a  little bit of time to warm up but then
jZ1VqXXBa14,1341360,1347840,it's going to be five laps each on our  motorcycles i will go out first and  hopefully set a respectable lap time
jZ1VqXXBa14,1347840,1355880,that zach will then try and match or  potentially best but i'm not really  worried about that  team jack
jZ1VqXXBa14,1362080,1367520,this is it folks for all the glory  to prove the point  that sport tourists can't hold the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1367520,1374159,candle sport bikes  all that pressure's on my shoulders
jZ1VqXXBa14,1374159,1381120,i have no doubt  that the performance of the zx10 is  superior  the problem is that i
jZ1VqXXBa14,1381120,1388559,have to extract that performance  start my little lap timer here
jZ1VqXXBa14,1388559,1391200,it's go time
jZ1VqXXBa14,1394880,1400919,and off we go  off to the races so to speak
jZ1VqXXBa14,1409680,1413459,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1422720,1429279,already getting some slides out of the  rear i'm trying to dump throttle in  these apexes but man it's our response
jZ1VqXXBa14,1429279,1435360,in this bike is  very abrupt off the bottom  [Applause]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1435360,1442240,come on  riding a full-size superbike on a track  this size is kind of like flying a jet
jZ1VqXXBa14,1442240,1447919,in a hangar  you've got a lot of power and not a lot
jZ1VqXXBa14,1447919,1450799,of space to use it
jZ1VqXXBa14,1455039,1462320,the back section of track rays right now  is super super tight that's probably the  hardest part on the big zx10 is the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1462320,1468799,really really slow first gear corners  transitions well side to side but it  doesn't make power until pretty high up  in the revs that's where it really wants
jZ1VqXXBa14,1468799,1475039,to be  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1475039,1482000,thankfully the zx10 is wickedly fast  once you do spin it up  i was hopeful that the 150 mile per hour
jZ1VqXXBa14,1482000,1490278,straightaway speed not to mention  monster brakes would make up for any  time lost in the tighter sections
jZ1VqXXBa14,1500000,1510210,my apex  come on baby heading  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1513600,1521220,i'm ready this is the fast lap right  here  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1524960,1529720,it's out of work  i'm sweating
jZ1VqXXBa14,1534159,1541320,yeah  that's gonna do it  okay
jZ1VqXXBa14,1542799,1547919,well i was gonna give it one more laugh  but  i don't know if you noticed but i always  just chucked myself over the high side
jZ1VqXXBa14,1547919,1554320,in that last turn i did notice it was it  off throttle round throttle it was  coming on the throttle this thing hits  right off close yeah yeah yeah but in
jZ1VqXXBa14,1554320,1560000,any case the time to beat my friend  is a 114.44
jZ1VqXXBa14,1560000,1566159,good symmetry there not easy  a little scary this track has a lot of  bumps on it
jZ1VqXXBa14,1566159,1571279,that back section has so many  transitions where obviously the zx10 is  great yeah it's slapping from side to
jZ1VqXXBa14,1571279,1577039,side but the fact of the matter is the  apex speeds are so slow that having your  knee on the ground at like 30 miles an
jZ1VqXXBa14,1577039,1583440,hour  it just feels awkward and then you try  and  pour the gas on this thing it's got no  power yeah it doesn't make power until
jZ1VqXXBa14,1583440,1588960,you're going much faster than that we  don't know much about lap times at this  racetrack we don't but uh but that's the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1588960,1595279,time it's data team four the top beat we  got a time to beat well done thanks
jZ1VqXXBa14,1596840,1602080,man the gauntlet had been thrown  all i had to do was ride this heavier
jZ1VqXXBa14,1602080,1609360,and slower motorcycle faster than arie  henning  who by the way was already taunting me
jZ1VqXXBa14,1609360,1616240,got that ninja name  you got them genetics it's gonna be  great watching you bail around with  saddlebags on
jZ1VqXXBa14,1616240,1618960,don't remind me
jZ1VqXXBa14,1622640,1628240,all right  team sport touring
jZ1VqXXBa14,1628240,1630799,here we go
jZ1VqXXBa14,1635279,1643120,and away he goes in a hurry  to go buy groceries or go to the office  or get his taxes done or something
jZ1VqXXBa14,1644270,1650320,[Music]  let's go  it's so quiet
jZ1VqXXBa14,1650320,1657360,he's at full chat going down the  straightaway but  barely sounds like a whisper it's like a  very large sewing machine
jZ1VqXXBa14,1657360,1663520,suspension's a little bit  wiggly and wobbly on this bike  but the chassis is
jZ1VqXXBa14,1663520,1668919,surprisingly good  for a bike with saddlebags
jZ1VqXXBa14,1669360,1675120,the two kawasaki's are related by name  but not by engine
jZ1VqXXBa14,1675919,1682000,where the zx10 makes power high in the  revs the ninja 1000 is just the opposite
jZ1VqXXBa14,1682000,1687440,lots of torque on tap it's predictable  and stable  it's the kind of track bike you'd want
jZ1VqXXBa14,1687440,1693600,to introduce to your mother  but it does have its performance limits
jZ1VqXXBa14,1695200,1701279,i believe i just heard a foot peg  touchdown  oh my god foot pegs are buried
jZ1VqXXBa14,1701279,1705080,got a lean way off
jZ1VqXXBa14,1710559,1717200,i do know having ridden that motorcycle  that he's going to struggle with the abs  it's very conservative
jZ1VqXXBa14,1717200,1722960,go go go  wide open through the pumps  the abs
jZ1VqXXBa14,1722960,1729039,is freaking out  and the foot pegs are dragging so hard
jZ1VqXXBa14,1729039,1735230,come on ninja 1000  might be all i got right here
jZ1VqXXBa14,1735230,1743520,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1743520,1749760,you made it look like fun  i could hear you just torching those  foot pegs all around the racetrack yeah
jZ1VqXXBa14,1749760,1756399,can you hear it oh yeah if you can't  hear the engine it's so quiet but when  you're banking it through the apex is  you here
jZ1VqXXBa14,1756399,1762320,so  i mean  a pretty fun  bike all things considered it looked  like you were having a blast yeah it's
jZ1VqXXBa14,1762320,1769120,super fun but come on the number i'm not  looking intentionally i have a number in  my head okay oh yeah
jZ1VqXXBa14,1769120,1775440,117.  117.00
jZ1VqXXBa14,1775440,1781360,how about that ladies and gentlemen  the fact that all those times are so  close is indicative of me just like
jZ1VqXXBa14,1781360,1786880,bumping up against my limit on this  machine  so first one in the books the two in a  little more than two and a half seconds
jZ1VqXXBa14,1786880,1792240,behind with the uh  ninja v ninja so  i'm gonna need the motorcycles to really
jZ1VqXXBa14,1792240,1795840,up their game to help me catch him
jZ1VqXXBa14,1797919,1804480,lucky for zach the s1000xr has bonafide  superbike dna
jZ1VqXXBa14,1804960,1810799,it's also extremely red  which clearly means it's fast
jZ1VqXXBa14,1810799,1816080,okay everybody we're going to turn on  our little lap timer thingamajig
jZ1VqXXBa14,1816080,1823840,and uh the lab timer says go  two exclamation points  couldn't have said it better myself
jZ1VqXXBa14,1825380,1828509,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1831600,1838559,all right  a lot more  horsepower same weight as the ninja 1000
jZ1VqXXBa14,1838559,1845039,so we'll see how we do  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1845039,1850080,the brakes on that bike are genuinely  phenomenal it's also in combination it's
jZ1VqXXBa14,1850080,1855440,got the desa so the electronic  suspension so you get on the brakes but  compression damping ramps up at the same
jZ1VqXXBa14,1855440,1864200,time so the fork doesn't dive very much  and you can trail brake so hard and late  in the corners with that front end
jZ1VqXXBa14,1865120,1872000,the xr changes direction super fast for  what it is  but what it is is tall and heavy and
jZ1VqXXBa14,1872000,1877360,that makes the side-to-side transitions  a little tricky  i missed my line
jZ1VqXXBa14,1877360,1889919,come on s1000  really  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1889919,1896480,i can feel the trash control cutting out  i feel safe but i don't feel fast
jZ1VqXXBa14,1896480,1901600,so i just shut it off on the  straightaway  i'm gonna try that
jZ1VqXXBa14,1901600,1907630,hope that helps this out a little bit  gotta keep them left time is coming down
jZ1VqXXBa14,1907630,1913440,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1913440,1918840,otc  is a real wild ride  we're having fun
jZ1VqXXBa14,1918840,1924159,though definitely faster on the s1000xr  but
jZ1VqXXBa14,1924480,1932230,i'm going to go with a 16-3 that's  conservative i wouldn't be surprised he  just faster  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,1932320,1936320,come on that's one thousand gotta get  out of the street away
jZ1VqXXBa14,1939810,1946240,[Music]  i'm putting my hand up there's no one
jZ1VqXXBa14,1946240,1952240,else on the track zach that's okay  that's a good habit
jZ1VqXXBa14,1954880,1961360,looking mighty aggressive out there i  mean a couple of occasions where i was  like damn
jZ1VqXXBa14,1961360,1967440,i had to turn tc off it was getting in  my way oh really yeah and like it slides  at the same approximate point in the
jZ1VqXXBa14,1967440,1973440,power band that it wants to wheely so  like in the fast left i was on the gas  in second gear and it stepped out and
jZ1VqXXBa14,1973440,1980159,then as it hooked up the front wheel  came up so it's like it's going between  a slide and a wheelie and you're like ah  it's a lot to manage i mean it's a
jZ1VqXXBa14,1980159,1988240,vicious machine for a sport tour  what's the time  guesses uh i estimated a 16-3 but
jZ1VqXXBa14,1988240,1993840,i said i would not be surprised if  you're faster  wow
jZ1VqXXBa14,1993840,2000080,115.56  so 1.5 seconds faster than the ninja
jZ1VqXXBa14,2000080,2005200,1000 whatever that means 1.1 seconds  slower  than the zx10
jZ1VqXXBa14,2005200,2010240,so  you might say the toronto's in with a  shout maybe i think so yeah absolutely
jZ1VqXXBa14,2010240,2017360,it's going to be a lot lighter you're  not going to have coordinated clearance  issues and it's got plenty of horsepower  so well it's all on nephew zach then
jZ1VqXXBa14,2017360,2023279,isn't it  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,2023279,2028880,sport touring's final hope  auditus orgasmus
jZ1VqXXBa14,2028880,2035120,aprilia's tuono v4  the time to beat
jZ1VqXXBa14,2035120,2040720,one minute 14 seconds 0.4  an additional 10 horsepower
jZ1VqXXBa14,2040720,2046720,shed a bunch of pounds  hashtag no excuses  i don't know with the time he did on the
jZ1VqXXBa14,2046720,2051440,s1000  i'm a little nervous
jZ1VqXXBa14,2053520,2058888,sounds so good  [Music]  [Applause]
jZ1VqXXBa14,2059040,2064559,whoa  that is an angry angry
jZ1VqXXBa14,2072839,2080000,machine the zx10 is a total slug off of  closed throttle and that tight back  section i know for a fact that toronto
jZ1VqXXBa14,2080000,2085989,is just going to be an absolute rocket  ship it has so much mid-range torque
jZ1VqXXBa14,2085989,2091040,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,2091040,2103769,it's already spin tire  get it zack  [Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,2104079,2110320,gotta stand on the pegs in this section  ah  kicked out of the seat
jZ1VqXXBa14,2110320,2116680,really hard  keep the bike on track when there's so  many bumps
jZ1VqXXBa14,2117350,2123599,[Music]  the windows power to weight ratio  is still not as good
jZ1VqXXBa14,2123599,2128880,as the zx10 but  [Music]  the torque is right there and it creates
jZ1VqXXBa14,2128880,2131838,power immediately
jZ1VqXXBa14,2135620,2142590,[Music]  off the track in the dirt still upright  okay
jZ1VqXXBa14,2142590,2145749,[Music]
jZ1VqXXBa14,2148240,2153520,huh  maybe he feels like he got everything he
jZ1VqXXBa14,2153520,2158280,could out of it wasn't out there for  very long
jZ1VqXXBa14,2161680,2168320,that didn't go so well did it no i mean  it looked like you were giving it hell  but is that is that it
jZ1VqXXBa14,2168560,2174720,i mean i only did one flying lap yeah  but i think that's the best i can do
jZ1VqXXBa14,2174880,2182800,holy  are you serious  11317 over a second faster than the zx10
jZ1VqXXBa14,2182800,2188720,that's remarkable it's staggering that  is absolutely staggering so it's got  acceleration and more cornering
jZ1VqXXBa14,2188720,2194400,clearance you think it's you think it's  just like stuff over there where it's  like getting through those corners that  much faster maybe maybe like the torque
jZ1VqXXBa14,2194400,2199599,when it comes out of corners like it is  limited in second gear still a little  bit as we've complained about before in
jZ1VqXXBa14,2199599,2204880,this video but  it still grunts off corners really well  and i think it's not it's always in the
jZ1VqXXBa14,2204880,2210480,meat of the power whereas the zx10 in a  lot of places like you have to open the  throttle and wait for it wait for it  wait for it and then it can finally
jZ1VqXXBa14,2210480,2218000,accelerate because of the gearing and  because of how tight the track is yeah  and i think this bike isn't super bike  light but it's close yep closer and like
jZ1VqXXBa14,2218000,2223760,you said the pegs don't drag and on like  a track with a lot of transitions back  and forth
jZ1VqXXBa14,2223760,2229599,i think it's the sweet spot maybe for  the level that you and i ride at you  know i mean that is
jZ1VqXXBa14,2229599,2236079,way more potential out of this bike than  i even thought i thought if i could get  a a dead nuts lap time a thai ball game
jZ1VqXXBa14,2236079,2241599,yeah that would have been like a victory  for sport touring  that's pretty impressive man i'm gonna
jZ1VqXXBa14,2241599,2248400,get my helmet in gloves i want to ride  it  it only took a couple of laps for me to
jZ1VqXXBa14,2248400,2256000,confirm that the tuono was indeed  quicker than the zx10  at least around this track
jZ1VqXXBa14,2256000,2261680,so  are sport touring bikes actually faster  than superbikes
jZ1VqXXBa14,2262079,2268320,wide open on the longest straightaway of  your life a superbike is tough to beat
jZ1VqXXBa14,2269680,2278400,and in a good old-fashioned drag race  any bike that comes from the factory  with saddlebags will struggle to keep up
jZ1VqXXBa14,2280800,2287920,but when it comes to hustling through a  section of twists and turns  the answer is  yes
jZ1VqXXBa14,2287920,2293480,a sport touring bike can be faster than  a superbike
jZ1VqXXBa14,2299040,2304160,alrighty well as promised answers to  questions about motorcycling that nobody
jZ1VqXXBa14,2304160,2309359,asked barry i'm curious to hear your  thoughts  yeah i mean a little bit of a surprise
jZ1VqXXBa14,2309359,2314720,there you know kind of reminds me of the  time my my girlfriend charlene came home  with these waffle fries from chick-fil-a
jZ1VqXXBa14,2314720,2321599,she said they were as good as my  favorites the the curly's from jack in  the box i thought the woman lost her  mind but i tried them and
jZ1VqXXBa14,2321599,2327440,holy smokes they were great  what about you jack any final thoughts
jZ1VqXXBa14,2327440,2334160,uh do it again son  i said what about you jack any final  thoughts oh final thoughts sure yeah
jZ1VqXXBa14,2334160,2341040,well uh you know  these bikes are real fast these days  like i said um it reminds me of first  bike actually back 1970 something there
jZ1VqXXBa14,2341040,2346560,all right well unfortunately we don't  have any more time but thank you for  watching and tune in next time where we
jZ1VqXXBa14,2346560,2354160,try to turn a motorcycle into a boat i'm  your host bob spencer and this has been
jZ1VqXXBa14,2354160,2363389,xp  [Applause]
