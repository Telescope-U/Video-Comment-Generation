wmTXqRf5V-Y,230,1890,"- Hello, my beautiful doves."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1890,4650,"My name is Mina, and welcome back to my channel."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,4650,8889,Today we're gonna be talking about TikTok maximalism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,8890,10680,Specifically this.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,10680,12380,"I'm not sure if this style has a name,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,12380,14050,but I saw this tweet some weeks ago
wmTXqRf5V-Y,14050,17400,"that referred to it as ""the weird girl aesthetic""."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,17400,18939,"But if that doesn't mean anything to you,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,18940,20500,how I would describe it is
wmTXqRf5V-Y,20500,23650,"a colorful, hyper-maximalist cluttered style"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,23650,25992,"that references a lot of Y2K trends like micro minis,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,25992,29550,"plastic jewelry, fuzzy bags, et cetera."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,29550,30630,"If you come to New York City,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,30630,34320,I swear 90% of art school kids dress like this.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,34320,37710,"So, similar to my previous aesthetic breakdown videos,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,37710,40548,"like the Old Money aesthetic and balletcore,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,40548,43830,we're going to be diving into the origins of this style
wmTXqRf5V-Y,43830,45914,and the cultural meanings.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,45914,48331,(jazz music)
wmTXqRf5V-Y,55560,57800,So I actually wanna start this video
wmTXqRf5V-Y,57800,60440,with a little bit of Harajuku history.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,60440,62280,A lot of today's maximalist styling
wmTXqRf5V-Y,62280,64479,"takes influence from harajuku styles,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,64480,66470,whether or not people are aware of it.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,66470,68630,"Case in point, Marc Jacobs' line ""Heaven"","
wmTXqRf5V-Y,68630,70167,which was coined in the press as
wmTXqRf5V-Y,70167,73100,"""offering a slither of Marc's subversive aesthetic"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,73100,76390,and approach to fashion all while foregoing gender norms
wmTXqRf5V-Y,76390,79417,"by focusing on a new generation of fashion creatives."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,79417,81230,"""Heaven"", since its incarnation,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,81230,83690,"has gained a massive Gen Z following,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,83690,86312,"with celebrity cool girl icons such as Bella Hadid,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,86312,90167,Beabadoobee and PinkPantheress helping to promote the brand.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,90167,92010,"""Heaven"" also hasn't shied away"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,92010,94770,from its Harajuku influences.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,94770,97426,"Shoichi Aoki, founder of Japanese street fashion magazine"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,97427,99090,"""FRUiTS"", was commissioned to capture"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,99090,101299,"12 icons self-styling ""Heaven"" pieces"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,101300,103210,for their first official lookbook.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,103210,104120,But let me backtrack.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,104120,106430,"For anyone who's unfamiliar with Harajuku,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,106430,107930,"it's an area of Tokyo, Japan,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,107930,109840,famous for its eclectic street fashion
wmTXqRf5V-Y,109840,111859,in the 90s and early 2000s.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,111860,114220,Gwen Stefani infamously made an entire album
wmTXqRf5V-Y,114220,116290,"called ""Love. Angel. Music. Baby."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,116290,118980,which were the stage names of the Japanese backup dancers
wmTXqRf5V-Y,118980,120956,"she hired to follow her around everywhere,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,120956,123380,also known as the Harajuku Girls.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,123380,126460,"Make no mistake, the entire ordeal was very orientalist"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,126460,127632,and fetishistic.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,129899,132200,- What the fuck is going on in here on this day?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,132200,133379,"- [Mina] So, prior to the 90s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,133380,135310,"there were some fashion movements in Japan,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,135310,137428,"like the Harajuku Zoku of the 1960s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,137428,141670,"the preppy-style bamboo tribe, and the DC boom of the 1980s."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,141670,143970,"But otherwise, Shoichi Aoki notes"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,143970,146670,that it wasn't until around 1996
wmTXqRf5V-Y,146670,149630,when a turning point was reached in Japanese fashion.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,149630,152800,"He notes that at this time there were, like, no trends."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,152800,155180,"So people mixed brands, reconstructed"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,155180,157000,"and deconstructed garments,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,157000,160340,"incorporated traditional Japanese clothes, and so forth."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,160340,162902,Japan was very influenced by what was actually happening
wmTXqRf5V-Y,162902,164689,in the streets of London.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,164690,166380,Secondhand clothing for a long time
wmTXqRf5V-Y,166380,168700,"wasn't viewed as fashionable in Japan,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,168700,169890,but young people buying
wmTXqRf5V-Y,169890,172040,in London's Portobello and Camden Markets
wmTXqRf5V-Y,172040,173569,were making it trendy.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,173570,175730,Since then there's been a number of different fashions
wmTXqRf5V-Y,175730,178230,"that have emerged in Harajuku, including Lolita, Cyber,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,178230,180690,"Shironuro, Decora, et cetera."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,180690,181523,But something interesting
wmTXqRf5V-Y,181523,183830,is that there's also a good number of people
wmTXqRf5V-Y,183830,185820,who have blurred and integrated
wmTXqRf5V-Y,185820,187960,different elements of each of these styles
wmTXqRf5V-Y,187960,190310,to make an outfit that is wholly unique.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,190310,192709,But what was the reason for this creative outburst?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,192710,194320,"Well, starting in the 1990s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,194320,197200,Japan was going through a period of economic stagnation.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,197200,198430,"People were getting laid off,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,198430,201359,"suicide rates among middle-aged men were increasing,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,201360,203540,and juvenile delinquency on a whole
wmTXqRf5V-Y,203540,205260,was becoming way more common.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,205260,208409,"There was growing widespread disillusionment, uncertainty,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,208410,211550,and anger that was just spreading across society.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,211550,215790,"So, as society's values start to change, a lot of people,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,215790,217670,"predominantly younger people,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,217670,220380,started to prioritize their individual identity
wmTXqRf5V-Y,220380,222620,"over the corporate and family identity,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,222620,224336,which was the most important thing
wmTXqRf5V-Y,224337,226670,for a while in Japanese culture.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,226670,228290,"On top of that, Aoki explains"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,228290,230349,that it wasn't until around the 1950s
wmTXqRf5V-Y,230350,233060,when Western fashion was introduced to Japan.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,233060,235394,"And so, Japan consumed it all at once,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,235394,237870,giving way to a unique attitude and look
wmTXqRf5V-Y,237870,240980,that could only be seen as a result of this catch up.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,240980,242670,It's actually quite liberating and free
wmTXqRf5V-Y,242670,244420,to pick and choose styles from history
wmTXqRf5V-Y,244420,246150,and combine them to create the unique looks
wmTXqRf5V-Y,246150,247000,that eventually evolved
wmTXqRf5V-Y,247000,249370,into the Japanese streetwear we see today.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,249370,250849,What I've always found very interesting
wmTXqRf5V-Y,250850,253330,"about Harajuku styles, is the use of thrifting"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,253330,258290,and the use of wearing unconventional items on the body.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,258290,259130,Amelia Bloom writes
wmTXqRf5V-Y,259130,261256,"in ""Power Play and Performance in Harajuku"","
wmTXqRf5V-Y,261256,263229,"""being able to find and wear secondhand clothing"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,263230,265100,in new ways is a mark of independence
wmTXqRf5V-Y,265100,268610,and a quiet resistance against the fashion system's dictums.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,268610,270110,They use experimental dressing
wmTXqRf5V-Y,270110,271780,to communicate with wider society
wmTXqRf5V-Y,271780,273420,their disillusionment with it.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,273420,275340,They are costuming their alienation
wmTXqRf5V-Y,275340,277220,and at times questioning the very meaning
wmTXqRf5V-Y,277220,278800,"and function of dress."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,278800,282509,"So, much of the reason why we know of Harajuku in the west"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,282510,285730,"is thanks to magazines such as ""FRUiTS"" and ""Kera"","
wmTXqRf5V-Y,285730,287390,which exported the culture.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,287390,289970,But these weren't the only fashion magazines in existence.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,289970,291170,"There were actually a good number,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,291170,293490,"including ""Tune"", ""Egg"", ""Zipper"", and ""Cutie"","
wmTXqRf5V-Y,293490,294919,and many of these magazines
wmTXqRf5V-Y,294920,296970,actually invited school girls to their offices
wmTXqRf5V-Y,296970,298590,to hang out or even work.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,298590,300699,"As in the case of ""Heart Candy"" magazine,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,300700,303730,which recruited 18 to 20 year olds as editorial staff.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,303730,307550,Yuniya Kawamura describes how Harajuku was very trickle up.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,307550,309110,Most of the shops that existed there
wmTXqRf5V-Y,309110,311229,at the time of her research were opened up by
wmTXqRf5V-Y,311230,314840,young artists and students who had no formal training.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,314840,317010,It was also pretty common for fashion houses
wmTXqRf5V-Y,317010,320470,"to employ teen girls as forecasters, designers,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,320470,323360,"marketers, sales people, merchandisers,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,323360,325599,"stylists, models, you name it."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,325600,326980,"But I don't wanna over generalize,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,326980,329460,there is a noticeable difference between
wmTXqRf5V-Y,329460,330910,high fashion magazines
wmTXqRf5V-Y,330910,333840,"and these street fashion magazines in Japan,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,333840,335970,Kawamura notes that when she was in Tokyo
wmTXqRf5V-Y,335970,337660,"and speaking to industry people,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,337660,339290,these professionals were reluctant
wmTXqRf5V-Y,339290,342740,to be associated with street fashion or subcultural fashion.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,342740,344637,She quotes an independent publicist she met.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,344637,347940,"""These street fashion related magazines are looked out upon"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,347940,350370,by the mainstream fashion community in Japan.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,350370,352210,I would not know what to say to my clients
wmTXqRf5V-Y,352210,354470,if their clothes appeared in one of these magazines.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,354470,356960,"That would hurt their image and reputation."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,356960,359270,"Granted, this was in the early 2000s"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,359270,361310,when Kawamura was there doing her research.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,361310,363909,"And nowadays, I feel like street fashion"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,363909,365480,and local influencers
wmTXqRf5V-Y,365480,368250,"are valued pretty highly by the high fashion community,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,368250,369540,at least in the west.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,369540,372350,"For instance, Louis Vuitton's ""Supreme"" collaboration"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,372350,374240,in I think around 2016.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,374240,375930,And the overwhelming pressure for brands
wmTXqRf5V-Y,375930,378169,to form ambassadorships and partnerships
wmTXqRf5V-Y,378170,381030,"with hip young influencers like Emma Chamberlain,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,381030,384463,"Evan Mock, and all the nepotism babies in Hollywood."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,385412,387912,(piano music)
wmTXqRf5V-Y,389110,393254,"So, in the west, for the last couple years now,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,393254,395990,minimalism has been on its way out
wmTXqRf5V-Y,395990,399270,and maximalism has been on its way in.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,399270,400740,What do I mean by these terms?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,400740,402830,"Well, according to the Museum of FIT's"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,402830,405753,"minimalism-slash-maximalism exhibition,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,408467,412070,"""minimalism refers to the aesthetic of less is more,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,412070,413820,"it celebrates purity and restraint,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,413820,416620,"promoting qualities such as truth, order and harmony."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,416620,419810,"Minimalist fashions prioritize reduction and function,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,419810,421400,using clean lines and silhouettes
wmTXqRf5V-Y,421400,424440,to accentuate the relationship between body and garment.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,424440,427860,"On the other hand, maximalism refers to spectacle."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,427860,430979,Its beauty lies in excess and eclecticism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,430980,432870,"Throughout history, maximalist fashions"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,432870,434850,"have been associated with extravagant,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,434850,437380,"artifice, and nonfunctional style."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,437380,438600,"As a journalistic term,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,438600,440820,maximalism is often used in reference
wmTXqRf5V-Y,440820,442900,"to audacious, intricate aesthetics"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,442900,444970,"or exaggerated silhouettes."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,444970,447560,"For the last 100 years or so, or maybe longer,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,447560,449540,there's been this natural pendulum swing
wmTXqRf5V-Y,449540,452340,between maximalism and minimalism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,452340,455470,"In the 80s, for instance, maximalism was all the rage"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,455470,458030,with voluminous silhouettes and bold colors.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,458030,460340,It was all about ostentatious glamor.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,460340,462970,Pioneering designers of the time include Thierry Mugler
wmTXqRf5V-Y,462970,464440,and Gianni Versace.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,464440,467490,"Then, in the 90s, the streamlined minimalist look came in,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,467490,469759,"with major contributions from Helmut Lang,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,469760,471710,"Martin Margiela, and Prada."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,471710,474639,"Also, as a response to the 80s excess of Wall Street,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,474640,476770,grunge consumed youth culture.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,476770,480020,"The pendulum swung back to maximalism in the 2000s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,480020,482259,which borrowed from 1980s excess.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,482260,485270,The Y2K party girl was messy and over the top.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,485270,487050,Paris Hilton reigned supreme.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,487050,490379,And there was no such thing as too many accessories.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,490380,492410,"Then, as Sir Isaac Newton says,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,492410,495630,with every action is an equal and opposite reaction.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,495630,498240,So back to minimalism in the 2010s.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,498240,500590,Most fashion and lifestyle bloggers that were emerging
wmTXqRf5V-Y,500590,502638,"showcased their minimalist, modern homes,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,502638,504680,"Instagram feeds were monotone,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,504680,507469,and blazers from The Row and Celine were ever on trend.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,507469,510150,"On the youth front, grunge was making a comeback"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,510150,512270,"as soft grunge, and everything was in tones"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,512270,515159,"of black, white, pale pink and pale blue."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,515159,517909,And now we're once again maximalist.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,517909,520129,"On the high fashion front, Richard Quinn is known"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,520130,522659,"for experimenting with pattern, volume and proportion,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,522659,524870,"and even the Balenciaga Triple S sneaker,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,524870,526520,"which came out in 2017,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,526520,529340,is a representation of the bigger is better ideology
wmTXqRf5V-Y,529340,531290,attributed to maximalism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,531290,534652,"Sarah Camposarcone, hopefully I said that right,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,534652,537380,is a pretty big maximalist TikToker.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,537380,539420,And she has this video from January
wmTXqRf5V-Y,539420,541010,"breaking down one of her outfits,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,541010,542580,which I think is pretty good.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,542580,545840,"- Today we are going to get dressed, but what we're gonna do"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,545840,549230,is build the outfit together before we put it on.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,549230,552779,So all I've done so far is added this long sleeve.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,552780,556480,"It's a sheer sleeve, so your arms are still kind of showing,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,556480,558682,but there's still something covering them.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,558682,560930,This is the first step of layering.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,560930,564529,"Layering is my favorite thing in maximalism,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,564530,566655,so this is where we're at.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,566655,570773,So another thing I love about maximalism is mixing textures.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,570773,573770,"This cardigan is full of sequins,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,573770,576860,and I'm going to put it on top of the dress.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,576860,578920,"Looking at the waistline here,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,578920,582800,I'd love to add a belt and another texture.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,582800,585110,"I'm going to be adding this tulle collar,"

wmTXqRf5V-Y,588530,590470,and I'm just gonna tie it up in the back.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,590470,594269,"So to bring in another texture, I wanna do this scrunchy,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,594270,596720,and I might do it as a necklace.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,596720,599060,"It's hard to tell how it's gonna look with this neckline,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,599060,600800,"but if I can wrap it around that,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,600800,602490,I think that would look super cool.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,602490,605810,So I just so happen to have the matching scrunchy bag.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,605810,608250,"I love matching when it's a little bit unexpected,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,608250,612773,and this matching situation I am living for.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,612773,617650,"So I really wanna wear my metallic gold Molly Goddard boots,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,617650,619880,but what I already went ahead and did
wmTXqRf5V-Y,619880,622690,was added a ribbon around the boots
wmTXqRf5V-Y,622690,625120,that I'm gonna tie and lace up the whole way.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,625120,627790,"Though to mimic the ribbon colors,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,627790,630073,I'm going to do two different color gloves.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,630073,632757,"Okay, so you know the Coco Chanel saying"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,632757,635410,"""before you leave the house, take one thing off""?"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,635410,639209,"Well, I add one thing. Or a few."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,639210,643160,"So I have added this furry headband,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,643160,645600,and I'm going to add my YSL sunglasses
wmTXqRf5V-Y,645600,647733,to finish off the look.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,652410,656930,- There's a few different theoretical camps for maximalism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,656930,661110,Some people just throw any patterned color at the wall
wmTXqRf5V-Y,661110,663269,and see what sticks and what looks cool.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,663270,665861,"Other people, like what Sarah was explaining here,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,665861,668250,"go for a color theory,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,668250,670433,"so even though patterns are different,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,670433,672380,there is one color palette
wmTXqRf5V-Y,672380,674010,that kind of brings balance
wmTXqRf5V-Y,674010,675870,and brings the look all together.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,675870,678910,Sarah's additional choice in wearing a pink scrunchy
wmTXqRf5V-Y,678910,680384,and a matching scrunchy bag
wmTXqRf5V-Y,680385,684250,brings in a nice textural balance to the outfit as well.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,684250,685310,"On a simpler front,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,685310,688860,because not everyone is doing as much as Sarah does
wmTXqRf5V-Y,688860,690183,"on an everyday basis,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,690184,692840,"in the past year, we've seen lots of prints and patterns"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,692840,695420,that play into maximalist tendencies.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,695420,698550,Psychedelic marbling prints via brands such as GANNI
wmTXqRf5V-Y,698550,702170,"and Hosbjerg, fruit patterns via Lisa Says Gah,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,702170,705230,and checkered patterns like one scene from Holiday the label
wmTXqRf5V-Y,705230,706889,are a few examples.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,706890,708320,Layering and accessorizing
wmTXqRf5V-Y,708320,711650,"are also two very important components in maximalism,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,711650,712950,and we've definitely seen a growth
wmTXqRf5V-Y,712950,714570,of those two things as well.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,714570,717620,"For example, garments like arm warmers and leg warmers,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,717620,720466,"vests and subversive basics, all give way to different"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,720466,722750,and interesting types of layering.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,722750,725130,"And with accessorizing, hats, earmuffs,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,725130,727760,"chunky playful, plastic jewelry, and textured bags,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,727760,730000,all produced a larger than life look.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,730000,731880,"Other than the natural pendulum swing,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,731880,735640,sustainability is also a surprising important catalyst
wmTXqRf5V-Y,735640,736830,for maximalism.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,736830,738260,And this sounds like kind of strange
wmTXqRf5V-Y,738260,740745,"because you would think that to be sustainable,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,740745,742250,"you would be minimalist,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,742250,746440,"because you're trying to live a less is more lifestyle,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,746440,749160,but a lot of TikTokers consider themselves
wmTXqRf5V-Y,749160,751066,to be sustainable maximalists
wmTXqRf5V-Y,751067,755440,"in how they collect used, secondhand, vintage clothing"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,755440,756870,and how they try to bring life
wmTXqRf5V-Y,756870,758450,through older pieces in their closets
wmTXqRf5V-Y,758450,759950,through creative styling.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,759950,762183,And of course the pandemic is a big factor
wmTXqRf5V-Y,762183,765850,in why maximalism is becoming cool again.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,765850,768160,"CEO of Lisa Says Gah, Lisa Buller,"

wmTXqRf5V-Y,777765,779320,"Also over the pandemic,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,779320,781670,a lot of people took on new DIY hobbies.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,781670,784500,"TikTok, a major medium of where these videos were posted,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,784500,788340,"grew to a 100,000,000 users in the US alone in 2020."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,788340,790020,I dabble a little bit with TikTok
wmTXqRf5V-Y,790020,792774,and I've literally seen so many how-to videos
wmTXqRf5V-Y,792774,796330,"on how to upcycle different clothes, how to knit,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,796330,799720,"how to make carpets, or how to make rugs."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,799720,800990,Even brands themselves
wmTXqRf5V-Y,800990,803670,participated in this fostering of a DIY community
wmTXqRf5V-Y,803670,805180,over the pandemic.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,805180,808339,"For example, the brand Shrimps ran an Instagram competition"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,808340,811150,under the hashtag #stayathomeshrimps.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,811150,813630,"The challenge was for fans to sketch their dream outfits,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,813630,815700,and the chosen winner would receive a Shrimps bag
wmTXqRf5V-Y,815700,816900,of their choice.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,816900,819010,"Depop, an online secondhand marketplace,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,819010,820870,but also a platform where community members
wmTXqRf5V-Y,820870,822890,"sell original or upcycled clothing,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,822890,827670,saw a 40% increase in listings and a 65% uptick in sales

wmTXqRf5V-Y,831020,833970,with traffic on the app up to 74%.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,833970,837620,My theory is that DIY inevitably leads to maximalism
wmTXqRf5V-Y,837620,840270,"because when you're learning to create new things,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,840270,842340,"when you're learning different artistic mediums,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,842340,846270,"I feel like the compulsion is to go for more colors,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,846270,847260,"more embellishments,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,847260,849930,because you're just trying to like have fun
wmTXqRf5V-Y,849930,851830,and discover what you like.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,851830,853900,"And even on the home interior front,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,853900,856930,clutter core has been growing in popularity.

wmTXqRf5V-Y,869650,871690,What do you think about this aesthetic?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,871690,874390,"- Okay, so my personal opinion on clutter core"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,874390,875950,is that the images in this TikTok
wmTXqRf5V-Y,875950,878715,"actually bring me more anxiety than joy,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,878715,882220,but I do lean more towards like maximalism
wmTXqRf5V-Y,882220,885379,when it comes to my personal home interior design.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,885380,888960,I just lean more away from teenage bedroom

wmTXqRf5V-Y,909774,911440,What's fun about cluttercore
wmTXqRf5V-Y,911440,914350,is it requires personality and specialized interest

wmTXqRf5V-Y,997340,999980,I think Judy Berman is a really good writer

wmTXqRf5V-Y,1205950,1208260,and what is considered low brow.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1208260,1209560,"To relate that back to fashion,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1209560,1211750,even though there are trends that stick out these days
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1211750,1213995,"like low-rise jeans and subversive basics,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1213995,1216868,this is probably the first time in our historical timeline
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1216868,1221280,where there are so many different styles or aesthetics
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1221280,1223090,"coexisting all at once,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1223090,1226520,with not one being objectively better than the others.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1226520,1229030,"Also before, being part of a subculture"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1229030,1231830,was way more serious.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1231830,1234110,"Like, you wouldn't just wear a cut up t-shirt"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1234110,1237179,"secured with safety pins in the 1970s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1237180,1239450,unless you were aligned with the punk movement.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1239450,1242594,You didn't just wear baggy flannels and Nirvana t-shirts
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1242594,1246020,in the 90s if you weren't grunge.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1246020,1248730,"Nowadays, people, Gen Z in particular,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1248730,1251850,are just way more carefree about style.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1251850,1253340,"If you think an aesthetic is cool,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1253340,1255289,you can try it on for size.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1255289,1257610,That's why I think a lot of these aesthetics
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1257610,1260660,are evidently called aesthetics and not subcultures
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1260660,1264210,because it's just very surface level.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1264210,1265500,- Our friend Melissa Garcia is here
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1265500,1266830,"to talk to us all about this,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1266830,1268529,how we can recreate this look for ourself.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1268530,1269960,"Okay, so we're calling this,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1269960,1271450,"I wanna make sure I get this right, coastal,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1271450,1273019,I've been calling it coastal grandma chic.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1273020,1275070,"I'm throwing in the chic, but coastal grandma."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1275070,1275903,- Yes.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1275903,1277460,- We've got your first model. You're gonna walk us out here.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1277460,1279653,"Tell us what she's wearing, and what, tell us what this is."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1279653,1282330,- Yes. So this basically a whole moment.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1282330,1284350,"It's in fashion, we'll also do decor after,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1284350,1286669,"but it's really like coastal living,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1286670,1288400,that really effortless vibe.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1288400,1291420,- Though. I will say that actually cottagecore
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1291420,1293617,"and dark academia, I think, are two"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1293617,1295159,of some of the aesthetics
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1295160,1297041,that lean more into subculture
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1297041,1300969,"category because they have their little online communities,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1300969,1304150,"but for a lot of aesthetics, like,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1304150,1305900,I don't know the coconut girl aesthetic
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1305900,1307570,"or the coastal grandma aesthetic,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1307570,1310659,I haven't seen any kind of like community orientation
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1310660,1311600,around those.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1311600,1312740,And something else about Gen Z!
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1312740,1316766,Their generational humor is based on irony.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1316766,1317766,- Brocollie.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1322087,1327087,Treelon Musk.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1328583,1329416,Globama.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1331970,1335100,- A lot of times combining irony with nostalgia.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1335100,1337380,A popular subset of Gen Z light graphic design
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1337380,1340630,"consists of Word art typography, mismatched fonts,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1340630,1343180,bold primary colors and wobbling logos.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1343180,1345060,"All maximalist, might I add."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1345060,1347630,"So in my opinion, all these different factors"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1347630,1349601,work together to raise maximalism
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1349601,1353649,up on the current pedestal that it is today.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1353650,1356483,(soft jazz music)
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1363490,1366150,So there was one response to the weird girl fashion tweet
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1366150,1368367,I mentioned earlier that really stuck with me.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1368367,1370440,@teleport2mejane says
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1370440,1373269,"harajuku has amazing crazy thrift stores,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1373270,1375013,and I think the difference between these girls
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1375013,1378899,"is that the Western influencers' clothes look new,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1378900,1381380,"something from Urban Outfitters/Dollskill,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1381380,1383460,seemingly with the intention of looking weird
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1383460,1386720,versus liking unique things despite the mismatching.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1386720,1389210,Even though I think that there are very good examples
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1389210,1393029,"of maximalism in the west, this tweet is also very valid."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1393030,1394958,Essentially what this person is saying is that
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1394958,1398420,90s Harajuku styles were dominated by thrifting
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1398420,1399980,"and upcycling practices,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1399980,1403062,which organically led to eclectic styles.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1403062,1405480,"In contrast, a lot of influencers today"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1405480,1407746,who are leaning towards maximalist tendencies
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1407746,1410950,"gravitate towards specific brands like ""Dolls Kill"""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1410950,1414269,"or even ""Heaven"", which create new mass produced designs"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1414270,1415990,based on vintage aesthetics.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1415990,1417890,"In the end, Western maximalists"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1417890,1420470,can end up looking more manufactured.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1420470,1422880,That's not to say that all Western maximalists
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1422880,1423890,are like this.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1423890,1425990,"Like I mentioned before, Sarah,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1425990,1430346,and some other Instagrammers/TikTokers/fashion influencers
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1430346,1433179,"who view themselves as sustainable maximalists,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1433180,1435840,embrace the upcycling and thrifting practices
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1435840,1438270,that we saw in 90s Harajuku.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1438270,1439760,"When flipping through ""FRUiTS"" magazines,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1439760,1441190,you can see that teens in these photos
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1441190,1443049,were much more centric and authentic
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1443050,1445290,and that their clothes were actually vintage.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1445290,1446880,Every piece they wear seems to indicate
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1446880,1449243,that person's specific interest or personality.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1449243,1450610,It's like cluttercore.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1450610,1453040,"To do it right requires a lot of personalization,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1453040,1455010,which can't really be taught.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1455010,1457250,"The difference is that also back in the 90s,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1457250,1459037,"in the words of Shoichi Aoki,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1459037,1460640,"""the internet didn't exist then"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1460640,1462120,"and there weren't significant trends,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1462120,1464680,"so people had to figure it out by themselves."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1464680,1467710,"With that said, Aoki did shut down ""FRUiTS"" back in 2017,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1467710,1470320,"saying very simply that ""there are no more cool kids"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1470320,1471659,"left to photograph."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1471660,1473590,This decline in coolness can be attributed
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1473590,1475110,to a number of reasons.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1475110,1476990,Some people blame the role of fast fashion
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1476990,1478820,"and the ""Uniqlo"" clothing boom,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1478820,1482860,"which champion the exact opposite ethos of 90s Harajuku,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1482860,1486049,"simplicity, functionality, and comfortability."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1486050,1489560,"Aoki also blames the closure of Pedestrian Paradise,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1489560,1493850,or Hokosha Tengoku in 1998.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1493850,1496130,This area was a major gathering spot
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1496130,1499212,for cool and creative hip young adults and teens.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1499212,1501640,"And on top of its closure,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1501640,1504650,"international chains started to move into Harajuku as well,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1504650,1507937,further sucking away the originality that was left.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1507937,1510287,"""ID"" magazine published in 2017,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1510287,1513350,"""there are still the odd shops like Dog and 6% DokiDoki"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1513350,1515130,hidden close to Takeshita Street
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1515130,1517080,"that cater to FRUiTS-worthy kids,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1517080,1518500,"but they are few and far between,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1518500,1521720,and most of Harajuku now feels decidedly un-Japanese.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1521720,1523419,Although the area has tourism to thank
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1523420,1524680,"for its success in part,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1524680,1527470,"this has ultimately been the cause of its overexposure."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1527470,1529490,"And fashion designer, Daphne Mohajer,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1529490,1531445,"who worked with ""FRUiTS"" in 2010 notes,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1531445,1533750,"""people wear a lot less vintage,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1533750,1535720,there is less of a sense of eclecticism
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1535720,1537929,and much more mainstream fast fashion.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1537930,1540400,"They look good, but they look familiar."""
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1540400,1544430,But never fear. Aoki has recently mentioned in interviews
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1544430,1547560,"that he does wanna revive his ""FRUiTS"" project"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1547560,1551570,because he's been sensing a revival in Japanese fashion.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1551570,1553659,The question he's now exploring is how?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1553660,1555300,Because the magazine industry
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1555300,1557340,"is unfortunately a dying industry,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1557340,1559622,which I think is really a shame because
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1559622,1562919,"one of the reasons why I liked ""FRUiTS"" so much"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1562920,1566676,and why like a lot of these indie teen magazines
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1566676,1569032,is that they actually showcase
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1569032,1572350,actual kids in the neighborhood.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1572350,1574931,"Nowadays, the media is dominated by influencers"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1574931,1579110,"and celebrities and a little bit is fine,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1579110,1582500,"I think some people have good style,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1582500,1586254,but the tendency is that a lot of these
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1586254,1591254,higher profile people have these brand sponsorships
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1592050,1596270,or ambassadorships that get in the way with like
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1596270,1599410,"really, truly free personal styling."
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1599410,1602060,"And also like not all of them are fashion people,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1602060,1605130,like just because they're in some new trendy HBO Max show
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1605130,1607740,"doesn't mean that they should be on the cover of Vogue,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1607740,1608573,you know?
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1608573,1611582,"So, I'm holding out for a wave,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1611582,1616190,a new wave of youth-dominated indie magazines to come out
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1616190,1619153,"in the vibe shift but until then,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1619154,1621180,please let me know in the comments
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1621180,1624200,"what you think about maximalism, TikTok,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1625286,1627341,"Harajuku fashion,"
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1627341,1630470,really anything I've talked about in this video.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1630470,1632730,I would love to hear what you all have to say on it.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1632730,1635580,And thanks for hanging out with me today.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1635580,1637720,And I hope you have a lovely rest of your day
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1637720,1638897,and I'll see you next time.
wmTXqRf5V-Y,1638897,1639803,Bye.
