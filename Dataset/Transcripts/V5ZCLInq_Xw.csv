V5ZCLInq_Xw,1831679,1837120,i remember years ago when the alarm used  to go off in the morning the first thing  i did was roll over and hit the snooze
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1837120,1845360,button  in that instant where you have a choice
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1845360,1852960,a choice to either hit the snooze button  and go back to sleep in your nice warm  fluffy cozy bed or open your eyes and
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1852960,1858720,get out of bed  that's a choice that takes discipline  now i didn't have any discipline i
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1858720,1865519,always took the easy route the road that  was more comfortable the problem is when  you make this decision because it's the
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1865519,1871919,first decision that you make literally  the second you wake up you are letting  yourself off the hook you are literally
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1871919,1877919,training your mind to take the easy way  out throughout the whole day which in  turn leads to you taking the easy way
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1877919,1884240,out the whole month all year  discipline is not something that any of  us are born with it's a muscle that we
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1884240,1889279,have to train and i don't care what  anyone says it all starts at first  second
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1889279,1896000,how you start your day and that decision  that you make in that instant isn't as  small as just getting up a bed or not
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1896000,1904809,it's a decision that can shape the rest  of your [ __ ] life  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1904880,1910000,this ain't some motivational  inspirational [ __ ] this is the truth
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1910000,1915519,when i was younger i dreamed that one  day i'd get a job that paid me 50 grand  a year
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1915519,1921360,that for a boy where i come from was a  dream come true if you told me back then
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1921360,1926720,that i'd be running a seven figure  company and building a business of my  own i would have laughed in your face
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1926720,1932640,it wasn't until i started to believe  that i and i alone could shape my world  that i started achieving anything i
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1932640,1939039,wanted to that little decision in the  morning if you open your eyes and get  out of bed the next decision you face
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1939039,1944720,that day you're gonna now be disciplined  to not take the easy way out
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1944799,1952480,people don't realize it but that bed can  basically represent your entire life  [Applause]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1952480,1958480,if you stay in that bed you're literally  staying in your comfort zone which means  your day will be spent in your comfort
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1958480,1965279,zone and your month your year and before  you know it you spent your whole life in  your comfort zone never pushing yourself
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1965279,1972320,to new heights never trying anything new  taking risks moving forward it all  starts in that first second of your day
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1972320,1978399,so don't take it lightly  start building discipline it's something  i started doing and it helped me
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1978399,1983440,massively it ain't easy  but it's worth it
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1983820,1988450,[Music]

V5ZCLInq_Xw,1995919,2002320,i talk to millions of people across 50  countries  it's life's big myth
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2002320,2008880,that you can get fit before committing  to something challenging  let me explain
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2008880,2016240,we call it the spartan paradox  you must first commit to something
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2016240,2023519,and that forces you to do the work  with spartan we got seven million people
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2023519,2029039,off the couch  by having them put a date on the  calendar
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2029039,2035190,it's that simple  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2036159,2041810,once you put a date on the calendar  you get serious  you become disciplined
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2041810,2047519,[Music]  and if you don't  you get your eggs kicked because that
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2047519,2053760,day comes that event arrives with or  without you  [Music]

V5ZCLInq_Xw,2074158,2079200,no way  all the science all the data
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2079200,2084960,all of our millions of conversations  across all these countries says
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2084960,2092560,bullsh  you're just gonna procrastinate you're  not gonna do it  you end up talking yourself out of doing
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2092560,2099359,the work  new year's resolutions don't work  gym memberships don't work diets don't
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2099359,2106720,work  the only thing that works  is a date  with something challenging on your
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2106720,2112720,calendar  [Music]  so you want to find success  put a date on the calendar create a
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2112720,2118560,deadline  force yourself to make the hard choices  daily  look
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2118560,2124480,if humans didn't need deadlines schools  wouldn't need professors right  construction sites wouldn't need foremen
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2124480,2130640,teams wouldn't need coaches  think about it you want to change  if you're ready
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2130640,2136720,get a date on your calendar  you have to commit  you have to make it real it's a smart
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2136720,2141760,paradigm  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2141760,2147119,i think i could end it just like that  it's the spartan paradox that's it
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2149680,2156480,i'm gonna grind i'm going to fight i'm  going to work i'm going to press tour
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2156480,2162480,i'm going to learn i'm going to do  everything in my power every single day

V5ZCLInq_Xw,1831679,1837120,i remember years ago when the alarm used  to go off in the morning the first thing  i did was roll over and hit the snooze
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1837120,1845360,button  in that instant where you have a choice
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1845360,1852960,a choice to either hit the snooze button  and go back to sleep in your nice warm  fluffy cozy bed or open your eyes and
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1852960,1858720,get out of bed  that's a choice that takes discipline  now i didn't have any discipline i
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1858720,1865519,always took the easy route the road that  was more comfortable the problem is when  you make this decision because it's the
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1865519,1871919,first decision that you make literally  the second you wake up you are letting  yourself off the hook you are literally
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1871919,1877919,training your mind to take the easy way  out throughout the whole day which in  turn leads to you taking the easy way
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1877919,1884240,out the whole month all year  discipline is not something that any of  us are born with it's a muscle that we
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1884240,1889279,have to train and i don't care what  anyone says it all starts at first  second
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1889279,1896000,how you start your day and that decision  that you make in that instant isn't as  small as just getting up a bed or not
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1896000,1904809,it's a decision that can shape the rest  of your [ __ ] life  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1904880,1910000,this ain't some motivational  inspirational [ __ ] this is the truth
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1910000,1915519,when i was younger i dreamed that one  day i'd get a job that paid me 50 grand  a year
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1915519,1921360,that for a boy where i come from was a  dream come true if you told me back then
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1921360,1926720,that i'd be running a seven figure  company and building a business of my  own i would have laughed in your face
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1926720,1932640,it wasn't until i started to believe  that i and i alone could shape my world  that i started achieving anything i
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1932640,1939039,wanted to that little decision in the  morning if you open your eyes and get  out of bed the next decision you face
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1939039,1944720,that day you're gonna now be disciplined  to not take the easy way out
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1944799,1952480,people don't realize it but that bed can  basically represent your entire life  [Applause]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1952480,1958480,if you stay in that bed you're literally  staying in your comfort zone which means  your day will be spent in your comfort
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1958480,1965279,zone and your month your year and before  you know it you spent your whole life in  your comfort zone never pushing yourself
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1965279,1972320,to new heights never trying anything new  taking risks moving forward it all  starts in that first second of your day
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1972320,1978399,so don't take it lightly  start building discipline it's something  i started doing and it helped me
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1978399,1983440,massively it ain't easy  but it's worth it
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1983820,1988450,[Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1989679,1993278,everybody gets this wrong
V5ZCLInq_Xw,1995919,2002320,i talk to millions of people across 50  countries  it's life's big myth
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2002320,2008880,that you can get fit before committing  to something challenging  let me explain
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2008880,2016240,we call it the spartan paradox  you must first commit to something
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2016240,2023519,and that forces you to do the work  with spartan we got seven million people
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2023519,2029039,off the couch  by having them put a date on the  calendar
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2029039,2035190,it's that simple  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2036159,2041810,once you put a date on the calendar  you get serious  you become disciplined
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2041810,2047519,[Music]  and if you don't  you get your eggs kicked because that
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2047519,2053760,day comes that event arrives with or  without you  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2053760,2060638,then what  then you're embarrassed  humiliated  and you want another crack at it
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2060638,2066560,everyone everywhere i mean across 45  countries says to me  oh
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2066560,2074158,first i'm going to get in shape first  i'm going to start eating healthy first  i'm going to get my lifestyle intact
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2074158,2079200,no way  all the science all the data
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2079200,2084960,all of our millions of conversations  across all these countries says
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2084960,2092560,bullsh  you're just gonna procrastinate you're  not gonna do it  you end up talking yourself out of doing
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2092560,2099359,the work  new year's resolutions don't work  gym memberships don't work diets don't
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2099359,2106720,work  the only thing that works  is a date  with something challenging on your
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2106720,2112720,calendar  [Music]  so you want to find success  put a date on the calendar create a
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2112720,2118560,deadline  force yourself to make the hard choices  daily  look
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2118560,2124480,if humans didn't need deadlines schools  wouldn't need professors right  construction sites wouldn't need foremen
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2124480,2130640,teams wouldn't need coaches  think about it you want to change  if you're ready
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2130640,2136720,get a date on your calendar  you have to commit  you have to make it real it's a smart
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2136720,2141760,paradigm  [Music]
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2141760,2147119,i think i could end it just like that  it's the spartan paradox that's it
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2149680,2156480,i'm gonna grind i'm going to fight i'm  going to work i'm going to press tour
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2156480,2162480,i'm going to learn i'm going to do  everything in my power every single day
V5ZCLInq_Xw,2162480,2167920,i'm going to do everything in my power  to become a victor not a victim
