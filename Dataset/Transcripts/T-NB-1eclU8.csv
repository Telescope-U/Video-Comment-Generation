T-NB-1eclU8,252799,255519,this cart looked much better in my old
T-NB-1eclU8,255519,257680,art room tour now it's just like kind of
T-NB-1eclU8,257680,260160,a catch-all for junk not that my custom

T-NB-1eclU8,298560,300800,of masking tape i have these massive
T-NB-1eclU8,300800,302560,paint brushes that i honestly don't
T-NB-1eclU8,302560,304400,really use for painting i do use these
T-NB-1eclU8,304400,306080,for thumbnails because they're nice and
T-NB-1eclU8,306080,308000,visible popsicle sticks which i use to

T-NB-1eclU8,310240,312479,have a bunch of little shrink plastic
T-NB-1eclU8,312479,314479,magnets that i made they're really cute
T-NB-1eclU8,314479,316800,i like them but occasionally they take
T-NB-1eclU8,316800,318880,me off because like
T-NB-1eclU8,318880,320639,every time i bump into it they fly and
T-NB-1eclU8,320639,323199,then i have to pick them up not a big
T-NB-1eclU8,323199,324960,video but still sometimes it's kind of
T-NB-1eclU8,324960,327520,annoying on the second layer of this
T-NB-1eclU8,327520,330960,card oh my gosh ugly paint water glasses

T-NB-1eclU8,349759,351919,find i have a different relationship
T-NB-1eclU8,351919,354240,with each of my pairs of scissors
T-NB-1eclU8,354240,357039,so that takes care of my painting area
T-NB-1eclU8,357039,359840,onto this big cabinet back here this is
T-NB-1eclU8,359840,361680,the same cabinet that i had in my old
T-NB-1eclU8,361680,363600,art room but if you remember before it
T-NB-1eclU8,363600,365199,was more
T-NB-1eclU8,365199,368000,long i decided to stack them on top of
T-NB-1eclU8,368000,370000,each other to save a little bit of space
T-NB-1eclU8,370000,372000,i still have all my customized bins i
T-NB-1eclU8,372000,374560,made an entire two-part video series
T-NB-1eclU8,374560,376720,painting these bins designing the little
T-NB-1eclU8,376720,379360,pins to go on them so on top of my
T-NB-1eclU8,379360,381919,cabinet i have my customized suitcase
T-NB-1eclU8,381919,383759,sitting there it has a nice little halo
T-NB-1eclU8,383759,385199,because there's a light right behind it
T-NB-1eclU8,385199,388479,it looks so majestic now this whole top
T-NB-1eclU8,388479,391280,row of bins oh my gosh i almost burned
T-NB-1eclU8,391280,392639,myself
T-NB-1eclU8,392639,393680,sorry
T-NB-1eclU8,393680,395680,all of those are full of finished
T-NB-1eclU8,395680,397600,customized squishies this is just my
T-NB-1eclU8,397600,399840,overflow collection that are not
T-NB-1eclU8,399840,402160,currently being displayed on the shelf
T-NB-1eclU8,402160,404240,some of them are not good enough some of
T-NB-1eclU8,404240,406160,them just don't stand up on their own
T-NB-1eclU8,406160,408639,and some of them i love they just don't
T-NB-1eclU8,408639,410479,fit on the shelf currently they're each
T-NB-1eclU8,410479,412880,stored in an individual ziploc bag this
T-NB-1eclU8,412880,414319,just keeps them from all sticking
T-NB-1eclU8,414319,416080,together also i've been meaning to
T-NB-1eclU8,416080,417520,organize these into four different
T-NB-1eclU8,417520,419199,categories they're just kind of all
T-NB-1eclU8,419199,422240,thrown in here randomly moving down i
T-NB-1eclU8,422240,426240,have this row of cabinets let us open it
T-NB-1eclU8,426240,427759,i have a series called dollar store
T-NB-1eclU8,427759,430560,makeovers so this is basically all stuff
T-NB-1eclU8,430560,432000,from the dollar store that i've been
T-NB-1eclU8,432000,433280,collecting
T-NB-1eclU8,433280,435680,moving right along to this cabinet
T-NB-1eclU8,435680,437840,basically the theme for this entire row
T-NB-1eclU8,437840,440560,of cabinets is stuff to paint on this is
T-NB-1eclU8,440560,442880,more stuff to paint on there's frames i
T-NB-1eclU8,442880,446000,think that's a jean jacket mini canvases
T-NB-1eclU8,446000,448479,and there's this one oh that's a mess
T-NB-1eclU8,448479,450160,i'm gonna take this out this one is all
T-NB-1eclU8,450160,453039,wooden objects really just crammed in
T-NB-1eclU8,453039,455520,there peg dolls russian nesting dolls
T-NB-1eclU8,455520,460160,wooden eggs wooden bowls wooden beads
T-NB-1eclU8,460160,462400,um
T-NB-1eclU8,462720,464720,maybe this isn't the best storage
T-NB-1eclU8,464720,466319,solution for that
T-NB-1eclU8,466319,469360,and then here on the end fuzzy little
T-NB-1eclU8,469360,471599,bin
T-NB-1eclU8,471599,476080,okay this is just full of makeup sponges
T-NB-1eclU8,476319,478240,all right i used to use these for little
T-NB-1eclU8,478240,480960,diy squishies and moving down i have
T-NB-1eclU8,480960,484639,another row of colorful bins this one
T-NB-1eclU8,484639,487840,let's see fluffy things that i am
T-NB-1eclU8,487840,491280,planning on customizing at some point
T-NB-1eclU8,491280,493440,oops sorry buddy oh
T-NB-1eclU8,493440,496960,my gosh i have a problem if you watch

T-NB-1eclU8,506560,511120,all my silicone molds big and small i
T-NB-1eclU8,511120,513279,used to use molds a lot more often when
T-NB-1eclU8,513279,515360,i was making squishies from scratch but
T-NB-1eclU8,515360,516719,every once in a while they do come in
T-NB-1eclU8,516719,518800,handy speaking of molds there's more
T-NB-1eclU8,518800,520880,molds this actually i bought because i
T-NB-1eclU8,520880,523039,had the brilliant idea to try to make a
T-NB-1eclU8,523039,524959,puzzle not realizing that the puzzle
T-NB-1eclU8,524959,527120,pieces don't actually go together which
T-NB-1eclU8,527120,529600,is stupid the rest of these though are
T-NB-1eclU8,529600,533040,just mostly dessert silicone molds it
T-NB-1eclU8,533040,535120,goes all the way down there there may or
T-NB-1eclU8,535120,536800,may not be a creature living in the
T-NB-1eclU8,536800,539360,darkness oh you're going back in there
T-NB-1eclU8,539360,541680,all right and all the way down here i am
T-NB-1eclU8,541680,543680,sitting on the floor very comfortable
T-NB-1eclU8,543680,545920,what do we have here these are just a
T-NB-1eclU8,545920,548560,bunch of craft kits that i have and the
T-NB-1eclU8,548560,550320,rest of these i installed the door

T-NB-1eclU8,559040,561279,with the word magic
T-NB-1eclU8,561279,564800,and this one these two massive
T-NB-1eclU8,564800,566800,two-minute tie-dye kits a while ago
T-NB-1eclU8,566800,568640,there was like a tie-dye shortage i
T-NB-1eclU8,568640,570240,don't want to be a victim of that again
T-NB-1eclU8,570240,572880,so any excuse to hoard things i will

T-NB-1eclU8,579200,581519,myself honestly and to the right of that
T-NB-1eclU8,581519,584320,cabinet is this little area which i call
T-NB-1eclU8,584320,586560,my drying station
T-NB-1eclU8,586560,589519,basically i just throw stuff here to dry
T-NB-1eclU8,589519,592000,i know unexpected at a drying station
T-NB-1eclU8,592000,593920,and i turn on these fans and it helps
T-NB-1eclU8,593920,596080,speed up the process oh
T-NB-1eclU8,596080,597519,that actually feels really good i'm
T-NB-1eclU8,597519,599760,really hot right now i have a chair here
T-NB-1eclU8,599760,602079,but i literally never sit in this chair
T-NB-1eclU8,602079,603519,in fact i think this might be the first
T-NB-1eclU8,603519,605519,time i've sat here i know that they say
T-NB-1eclU8,605519,607120,watching paint dry is like one of the
T-NB-1eclU8,607120,609279,most exciting things that you can do but
T-NB-1eclU8,609279,610800,i personally just don't get much of a
T-NB-1eclU8,610800,613040,thrill from it then on this back wall i
T-NB-1eclU8,613040,615680,have a bunch of my paint pores these
T-NB-1eclU8,615680,617760,four i did in a video and then these i
T-NB-1eclU8,617760,620160,did off camera those two little ones
T-NB-1eclU8,620160,621760,jordan actually did and this little
T-NB-1eclU8,621760,624880,table actually has some storage built
T-NB-1eclU8,624880,627200,into it which is a good news for me i
T-NB-1eclU8,627200,630000,have all of my yarn looks so pretty like
T-NB-1eclU8,630000,632720,this i have a bunch of different felts
T-NB-1eclU8,632720,635680,this stuff comes in handy a lot oh gosh
T-NB-1eclU8,635680,638560,this shelf has my little sock monkey i
T-NB-1eclU8,638560,641279,did not make that the guardian of my
T-NB-1eclU8,641279,644480,sewing kit and on the way bottom here is
T-NB-1eclU8,644480,646640,a bunch of different beads quick bead
T-NB-1eclU8,646640,649360,tour these are all new it took me like
T-NB-1eclU8,649360,651839,an hour to organize all these chunky
T-NB-1eclU8,651839,654240,beads pony beads in all different colors
T-NB-1eclU8,654240,655279,oh
T-NB-1eclU8,655279,657920,how these beads are mostly from my
T-NB-1eclU8,657920,660880,childhood i used to collect random beads
T-NB-1eclU8,660880,662880,took me forever to sort through all of
T-NB-1eclU8,662880,664480,my old beads and i tried to organize
T-NB-1eclU8,664480,666320,them the best i could and moving right
T-NB-1eclU8,666320,671040,along then we arrive at this door
T-NB-1eclU8,671040,673600,and inside of this closet i keep all of
T-NB-1eclU8,673600,676240,my sound panels when i'm not using them
T-NB-1eclU8,676240,678640,my big tripod that i actually usually
T-NB-1eclU8,678640,681600,have out and a couple extra lights all
T-NB-1eclU8,681600,685040,right here we go into the closet and
T-NB-1eclU8,685040,688800,boom here they are these are all my
T-NB-1eclU8,688800,690959,unpainted squishies most of these have

T-NB-1eclU8,693360,695519,had these in my blue couch room i also
T-NB-1eclU8,695519,698000,had them in all these mismatched bins i
T-NB-1eclU8,698000,700160,switched to this nice minimal white
T-NB-1eclU8,700160,702880,shelf and got all uniform bins i think
T-NB-1eclU8,702880,704399,it looks much better and much more
T-NB-1eclU8,704399,706720,cleaned up now although this place that
T-NB-1eclU8,706720,708720,they're living in is not the most
T-NB-1eclU8,708720,711920,aesthetic place oh yuck oh yuck this
T-NB-1eclU8,711920,713240,closet is like
T-NB-1eclU8,713240,715519,semi-unfinished also since i switched
T-NB-1eclU8,715519,717839,bins it completely threw off my
T-NB-1eclU8,717839,720000,organizational system that i set up in
T-NB-1eclU8,720000,722480,that one video still have the old labels
