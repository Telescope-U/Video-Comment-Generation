xGBHXLwfuWg,209820,217479,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,227240,232560,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,232560,235560,so
xGBHXLwfuWg,238390,254289,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,257919,259680,previous night before going to sleep i
xGBHXLwfuWg,259680,261199,had taken out frozen rice from the
xGBHXLwfuWg,261199,263040,freezer for preparing kerala putter for
xGBHXLwfuWg,263040,265600,breakfast and have shown this many times
xGBHXLwfuWg,265600,267680,in previous vlogs all you have to do is
xGBHXLwfuWg,267680,269759,store any leftover rice you use for
xGBHXLwfuWg,269759,272240,lunch or dinner store it in a container
xGBHXLwfuWg,272240,273520,and keep that in the freezer for at
xGBHXLwfuWg,273520,275280,least 24 hours
xGBHXLwfuWg,275280,277280,then take it out preferably the previous
xGBHXLwfuWg,277280,278479,night of the day you're planning for
xGBHXLwfuWg,278479,279759,breakfast
xGBHXLwfuWg,279759,281759,squeeze out all the water from the rice
xGBHXLwfuWg,281759,284320,and pulse it few times in a blender then
xGBHXLwfuWg,284320,287199,add that to a bowl
xGBHXLwfuWg,287520,290080,then mix in some rice flour and salt you
xGBHXLwfuWg,290080,292400,get really soft put if you make it this
xGBHXLwfuWg,292400,295400,way
xGBHXLwfuWg,303120,305280,there was enough water in the beef turn
xGBHXLwfuWg,305280,306960,on the flame to high and let the water
xGBHXLwfuWg,306960,309960,evaporate
xGBHXLwfuWg,313520,319759,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,319759,321280,that's
xGBHXLwfuWg,321280,324280,here
xGBHXLwfuWg,333960,338680,[Applause]
xGBHXLwfuWg,343560,351120,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,351120,353300,[Applause]
xGBHXLwfuWg,353300,360160,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,360160,363160,do
xGBHXLwfuWg,363380,375019,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,376000,377840,sometimes we tend to ignore these loose
xGBHXLwfuWg,377840,380240,handles and later it comes off i believe
xGBHXLwfuWg,380240,382319,if you fix it that moment the work is
xGBHXLwfuWg,382319,383280,over
xGBHXLwfuWg,383280,385120,whereas the wait for it to come off is
xGBHXLwfuWg,385120,387039,really not worth and it's really
xGBHXLwfuWg,387039,389280,frustrating to see pots with no handles
xGBHXLwfuWg,389280,391440,unless you need a major help i guess all
xGBHXLwfuWg,391440,393360,these works need to be done by whoever
xGBHXLwfuWg,393360,394720,handling the kitchen and most of the
xGBHXLwfuWg,394720,396880,time it's we women
xGBHXLwfuWg,396880,398479,why wait for someone to come and fix
xGBHXLwfuWg,398479,400800,when it's easy to do by ourselves
xGBHXLwfuWg,400800,402800,maybe not all but i know few people who
xGBHXLwfuWg,402800,404479,depend on their husband or fathers or
xGBHXLwfuWg,404479,406960,brothers for these simple causes or even
xGBHXLwfuWg,406960,409199,mothers i actually hate to depend on
xGBHXLwfuWg,409199,410880,someone for something that i myself can
xGBHXLwfuWg,410880,413120,do
xGBHXLwfuWg,413199,415520,into the dal goes in milk normally we
xGBHXLwfuWg,415520,417520,make moong dal kid with coconut milk and
xGBHXLwfuWg,417520,419840,jaggery this time for a change i use
xGBHXLwfuWg,419840,421840,cow's milk and to sweeten i added
xGBHXLwfuWg,421840,424240,condensed milk added two liters milk
xGBHXLwfuWg,424240,426319,into the cooked dal and kept that on
xGBHXLwfuWg,426319,429450,medium flame steering occasionally
xGBHXLwfuWg,429450,432540,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,435560,438660,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,441440,443919,add one tin condensed milk you may use
xGBHXLwfuWg,443919,446080,white sugar instead of this or a mix of
xGBHXLwfuWg,446080,447039,both
xGBHXLwfuWg,447039,448639,make sure you're giving a mix to the dal
xGBHXLwfuWg,448639,450479,in between or else there are chances for
xGBHXLwfuWg,450479,453120,it to stick at the bottom and can burn
xGBHXLwfuWg,453120,454880,and later the keel will have that burnt
xGBHXLwfuWg,454880,458840,flavor which you don't want
xGBHXLwfuWg,466960,470039,i think
xGBHXLwfuWg,471950,479929,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,483750,489740,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,490400,494000,turn off the flame when the key boils
xGBHXLwfuWg,494479,496160,the rest of the cooking was done after
xGBHXLwfuWg,496160,499120,having our breakfast
xGBHXLwfuWg,499120,501599,my husband and arman both loves to add
xGBHXLwfuWg,501599,502990,sugar to their pooter
xGBHXLwfuWg,502990,504479,[Music]

xGBHXLwfuWg,528720,529600,lunch
xGBHXLwfuWg,529600,531120,this is the best part of having a
xGBHXLwfuWg,531120,533440,dishwasher as you see the sink is piling
xGBHXLwfuWg,533440,535519,up you just have to take all the dishes

xGBHXLwfuWg,665240,674079,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,674079,675920,as you can see there's a lot of chillies
xGBHXLwfuWg,675920,679600,but these chilies are less spicy

xGBHXLwfuWg,1049200,1050960,about it the previous day
xGBHXLwfuWg,1050960,1052880,it looks really traditional and homely
xGBHXLwfuWg,1052880,1054400,when we have something on the banana
xGBHXLwfuWg,1054400,1055200,leaf
xGBHXLwfuWg,1055200,1057360,food when made with love we eat a cup of
xGBHXLwfuWg,1057360,1059679,tea tastes really good
xGBHXLwfuWg,1059679,1061360,i heard this dialogue from a malayana

xGBHXLwfuWg,1072799,1074880,do it for the sake
xGBHXLwfuWg,1074880,1076400,it clearly differs from the taste of
xGBHXLwfuWg,1076400,1079280,food made with so much love and care
xGBHXLwfuWg,1079280,1081280,that's why mother's food are always the
xGBHXLwfuWg,1081280,1082240,best
xGBHXLwfuWg,1082240,1083840,they prepare it for the family adding
xGBHXLwfuWg,1083840,1086720,the best ingredient that's love

xGBHXLwfuWg,89520,91439,for the beef now here instead of beef

xGBHXLwfuWg,227240,232560,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,232560,235560,so
xGBHXLwfuWg,238390,254289,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,257919,259680,previous night before going to sleep i
xGBHXLwfuWg,259680,261199,had taken out frozen rice from the
xGBHXLwfuWg,261199,263040,freezer for preparing kerala putter for
xGBHXLwfuWg,263040,265600,breakfast and have shown this many times
xGBHXLwfuWg,265600,267680,in previous vlogs all you have to do is
xGBHXLwfuWg,267680,269759,store any leftover rice you use for
xGBHXLwfuWg,269759,272240,lunch or dinner store it in a container
xGBHXLwfuWg,272240,273520,and keep that in the freezer for at
xGBHXLwfuWg,273520,275280,least 24 hours
xGBHXLwfuWg,275280,277280,then take it out preferably the previous
xGBHXLwfuWg,277280,278479,night of the day you're planning for
xGBHXLwfuWg,278479,279759,breakfast
xGBHXLwfuWg,279759,281759,squeeze out all the water from the rice
xGBHXLwfuWg,281759,284320,and pulse it few times in a blender then
xGBHXLwfuWg,284320,287199,add that to a bowl
xGBHXLwfuWg,287520,290080,then mix in some rice flour and salt you
xGBHXLwfuWg,290080,292400,get really soft put if you make it this
xGBHXLwfuWg,292400,295400,way
xGBHXLwfuWg,303120,305280,there was enough water in the beef turn
xGBHXLwfuWg,305280,306960,on the flame to high and let the water
xGBHXLwfuWg,306960,309960,evaporate
xGBHXLwfuWg,313520,319759,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,319759,321280,that's
xGBHXLwfuWg,321280,324280,here
xGBHXLwfuWg,333960,338680,[Applause]
xGBHXLwfuWg,343560,351120,[Music]

xGBHXLwfuWg,353300,360160,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,360160,363160,do
xGBHXLwfuWg,363380,375019,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,376000,377840,sometimes we tend to ignore these loose
xGBHXLwfuWg,377840,380240,handles and later it comes off i believe
xGBHXLwfuWg,380240,382319,if you fix it that moment the work is
xGBHXLwfuWg,382319,383280,over
xGBHXLwfuWg,383280,385120,whereas the wait for it to come off is
xGBHXLwfuWg,385120,387039,really not worth and it's really
xGBHXLwfuWg,387039,389280,frustrating to see pots with no handles
xGBHXLwfuWg,389280,391440,unless you need a major help i guess all
xGBHXLwfuWg,391440,393360,these works need to be done by whoever
xGBHXLwfuWg,393360,394720,handling the kitchen and most of the
xGBHXLwfuWg,394720,396880,time it's we women
xGBHXLwfuWg,396880,398479,why wait for someone to come and fix
xGBHXLwfuWg,398479,400800,when it's easy to do by ourselves
xGBHXLwfuWg,400800,402800,maybe not all but i know few people who
xGBHXLwfuWg,402800,404479,depend on their husband or fathers or
xGBHXLwfuWg,404479,406960,brothers for these simple causes or even
xGBHXLwfuWg,406960,409199,mothers i actually hate to depend on
xGBHXLwfuWg,409199,410880,someone for something that i myself can
xGBHXLwfuWg,410880,413120,do
xGBHXLwfuWg,413199,415520,into the dal goes in milk normally we
xGBHXLwfuWg,415520,417520,make moong dal kid with coconut milk and
xGBHXLwfuWg,417520,419840,jaggery this time for a change i use
xGBHXLwfuWg,419840,421840,cow's milk and to sweeten i added
xGBHXLwfuWg,421840,424240,condensed milk added two liters milk
xGBHXLwfuWg,424240,426319,into the cooked dal and kept that on
xGBHXLwfuWg,426319,429450,medium flame steering occasionally
xGBHXLwfuWg,429450,432540,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,435560,438660,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,441440,443919,add one tin condensed milk you may use
xGBHXLwfuWg,443919,446080,white sugar instead of this or a mix of
xGBHXLwfuWg,446080,447039,both
xGBHXLwfuWg,447039,448639,make sure you're giving a mix to the dal
xGBHXLwfuWg,448639,450479,in between or else there are chances for
xGBHXLwfuWg,450479,453120,it to stick at the bottom and can burn
xGBHXLwfuWg,453120,454880,and later the keel will have that burnt
xGBHXLwfuWg,454880,458840,flavor which you don't want
xGBHXLwfuWg,466960,470039,i think
xGBHXLwfuWg,471950,479929,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,483750,489740,[Music]
xGBHXLwfuWg,490400,494000,turn off the flame when the key boils
xGBHXLwfuWg,494479,496160,the rest of the cooking was done after
xGBHXLwfuWg,496160,499120,having our breakfast
xGBHXLwfuWg,499120,501599,my husband and arman both loves to add
xGBHXLwfuWg,501599,502990,sugar to their pooter
xGBHXLwfuWg,502990,504479,[Music]

xGBHXLwfuWg,528720,529600,lunch
xGBHXLwfuWg,529600,531120,this is the best part of having a
xGBHXLwfuWg,531120,533440,dishwasher as you see the sink is piling
xGBHXLwfuWg,533440,535519,up you just have to take all the dishes
xGBHXLwfuWg,535519,538000,into the dishwasher or not even wait you
xGBHXLwfuWg,538000,540240,use a pot it needs to be clean just add
xGBHXLwfuWg,540240,542000,to the dishwasher

xGBHXLwfuWg,546080,548720,used my iron skillet this is quite heavy
xGBHXLwfuWg,548720,551200,but really good one i bought this from
