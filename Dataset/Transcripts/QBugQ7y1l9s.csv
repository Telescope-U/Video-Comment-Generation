QBugQ7y1l9s,160,3520,today's gaming pc is going to be a very
QBugQ7y1l9s,3520,5839,special one i've been asked by intel
QBugQ7y1l9s,5839,7600,australian new zealand to put together a
QBugQ7y1l9s,7600,10639,pc that's under the budget of 1500
QBugQ7y1l9s,10639,12559,australian dollars and i'll be going up
QBugQ7y1l9s,12559,15200,against another youtuber gear seekers to
QBugQ7y1l9s,15200,17039,see who can produce the best value
QBugQ7y1l9s,17039,19279,versus performance pc and i'll throw
QBugQ7y1l9s,19279,21279,these benchmarks up on the screen for
QBugQ7y1l9s,21279,23600,you so eight benchmarks three creator
QBugQ7y1l9s,23600,26160,and there is five gaming benchmarks at
QBugQ7y1l9s,26160,28800,1080p now there are some rules to this
QBugQ7y1l9s,28800,31439,build the first being we have to use an
QBugQ7y1l9s,31439,34399,intel 12th generation processor and the
QBugQ7y1l9s,34399,36480,second rule is we have to use components
QBugQ7y1l9s,36480,39120,we can purchase readily and easily from
QBugQ7y1l9s,39120,41440,major australian new zealand tech retail
QBugQ7y1l9s,41440,43680,outlets listed on the screen this rules
QBugQ7y1l9s,43680,45200,out purchasing parts from ebay or
QBugQ7y1l9s,45200,48160,marketplaces to try and find a used deal
QBugQ7y1l9s,48160,49920,there because that is not indicative of
QBugQ7y1l9s,49920,52800,what the average person can build a pc
QBugQ7y1l9s,52800,55440,like this for also today's video is
QBugQ7y1l9s,55440,57600,sponsored by intel and thanks to them
QBugQ7y1l9s,57600,59600,i'm going to be giving this pc away
QBugQ7y1l9s,59600,61359,after i've built it and run the
QBugQ7y1l9s,61359,63520,benchmarks so stay tuned on how you can
QBugQ7y1l9s,63520,65198,get him with a chance to win but let's
QBugQ7y1l9s,65198,67200,go through with the parts selection and
QBugQ7y1l9s,67200,68960,then we'll build this thing up and see
QBugQ7y1l9s,68960,71130,how it can perform
QBugQ7y1l9s,71130,76680,[Music]
QBugQ7y1l9s,78479,80640,welcome back to tech yes city now when
QBugQ7y1l9s,80640,82799,it comes to benchmarks and getting the
QBugQ7y1l9s,82799,84960,best performance possible for a
QBugQ7y1l9s,84960,87680,particular budget i always place the
QBugQ7y1l9s,87680,90560,most emphasis on your cpu and your
QBugQ7y1l9s,90560,93119,graphics card so for the cpu we're going
QBugQ7y1l9s,93119,96320,with an i5 12 600 and you're probably
QBugQ7y1l9s,96320,97680,thinking well why didn't you go with the
QBugQ7y1l9s,97680,99920,k cpu or why didn't you go with the 12
QBugQ7y1l9s,99920,102240,400 and there's two reasons for that the
QBugQ7y1l9s,102240,103600,first being we didn't go with the k
QBugQ7y1l9s,103600,106079,because we get an included cpu cooler
QBugQ7y1l9s,106079,108479,with the 12 600 and also we didn't go
QBugQ7y1l9s,108479,111360,with the 12 400 because the 12 600 and
QBugQ7y1l9s,111360,114079,also the 12 500 they actually have a
QBugQ7y1l9s,114079,117200,better built-in onboard graphics which i
QBugQ7y1l9s,117200,119200,believe we will need for the creative
QBugQ7y1l9s,119200,120799,benchmark and although we're featured up
QBugQ7y1l9s,120799,123280,until this point intel's 12th gen i5
QBugQ7y1l9s,123280,125040,range here which offers some of the best
QBugQ7y1l9s,125040,127119,balance between gaming and productivity
QBugQ7y1l9s,127119,128640,if you want to take things a further
QBugQ7y1l9s,128640,131440,step down in cost the 12th gen eye 312
QBugQ7y1l9s,131440,134160,100 at the extreme budget range also
QBugQ7y1l9s,134160,136000,offers uhd graphics and has
QBugQ7y1l9s,136000,138160,exceptionally good performance too now
QBugQ7y1l9s,138160,139599,for the graphics card we are going with
QBugQ7y1l9s,139599,144720,an asrock challenger pro rx 6700 xt we
QBugQ7y1l9s,144720,146879,got this at a bargain price in my
QBugQ7y1l9s,146879,150160,opinion from bpc tech this is the three
QBugQ7y1l9s,150160,151840,fan edition i believe it's going to be
QBugQ7y1l9s,151840,153599,perfect for the benchmarks that we're
QBugQ7y1l9s,153599,155200,going to be running here today to get
QBugQ7y1l9s,155200,157120,that most performance possible then for
QBugQ7y1l9s,157120,159120,the memory we're going with 16 gigabytes
QBugQ7y1l9s,159120,161200,that's two by eight gigabyte sticks of
QBugQ7y1l9s,161200,164560,silicon power 3600 megahertz cl18 now it
QBugQ7y1l9s,164560,167040,is important in my opinion to get the
QBugQ7y1l9s,167040,168879,best value ram possible and at this
QBugQ7y1l9s,168879,171360,current point in time i believe ddr4
QBugQ7y1l9s,171360,174400,3600 megahertz is the way to go now for
QBugQ7y1l9s,174400,175440,the motherboard we're going with the
QBugQ7y1l9s,175440,177840,b660 gaming motherboard here from
QBugQ7y1l9s,177840,180000,gigabyte this is a cookie cutter
QBugQ7y1l9s,180000,181680,solution if i had a bit more in the
QBugQ7y1l9s,181680,183599,budget i'd definitely get something like
QBugQ7y1l9s,183599,185840,an asrock steel legend and of course
QBugQ7y1l9s,185840,188480,upgrade to 32 gigabytes of memory but
QBugQ7y1l9s,188480,190879,then we're going with the ssd 240
QBugQ7y1l9s,190879,193040,gigabytes just like the motherboard we
QBugQ7y1l9s,193040,195760,are cutting it close here to this budget
QBugQ7y1l9s,195760,197840,and so saving some money on storage is
QBugQ7y1l9s,197840,199840,just as crucial as saving it on the
QBugQ7y1l9s,199840,201360,motherboard then for the power supply
QBugQ7y1l9s,201360,204159,we've got a cx650m from corsair
QBugQ7y1l9s,204159,206560,semi-modular power supply corsair make
QBugQ7y1l9s,206560,208400,great power supplies so this thing
QBugQ7y1l9s,208400,210239,should be out of power this build with
QBugQ7y1l9s,210239,212560,no sweats at all then for the last piece
QBugQ7y1l9s,212560,214560,of the puzzle here we have the case
QBugQ7y1l9s,214560,216959,we're going with the deep cool mark cube
QBugQ7y1l9s,216959,219920,110. great looking case includes a rear
QBugQ7y1l9s,219920,222319,outtake fan it's got tempered glass it
QBugQ7y1l9s,222319,224319,looks good it's presenting great value
QBugQ7y1l9s,224319,226159,in my opinion and with that aside i'll
QBugQ7y1l9s,226159,228560,put the total budget up on the screen
QBugQ7y1l9s,228560,231120,for you guys where i'm literally hitting
QBugQ7y1l9s,231120,235200,that 1500 mark right on the pinpoint so
QBugQ7y1l9s,235200,236720,we came in here without a dollar to
QBugQ7y1l9s,236720,238959,spare let's quickly whip this thing up
QBugQ7y1l9s,238959,240879,because it's important on what i'm going
QBugQ7y1l9s,240879,242400,to be doing with some of the tuning
QBugQ7y1l9s,242400,244400,settings here to get the most out of
QBugQ7y1l9s,244400,246640,this rig to get the best benchmarks
QBugQ7y1l9s,246640,249640,possible
QBugQ7y1l9s,250290,262169,[Music]
QBugQ7y1l9s,265740,287740,[Music]
QBugQ7y1l9s,311130,314290,[Music]
QBugQ7y1l9s,320180,325680,[Music]
QBugQ7y1l9s,325680,327919,and we've built this gaming pc up with
QBugQ7y1l9s,327919,330400,absolute ease it was a breeze from start
QBugQ7y1l9s,330400,332639,to finish however once we've finished
QBugQ7y1l9s,332639,335199,this gaming pc there are a couple of
QBugQ7y1l9s,335199,337759,things i want to do to get the max
QBugQ7y1l9s,337759,339919,performance possible and the first thing
QBugQ7y1l9s,339919,342479,involves going into the bios making sure
QBugQ7y1l9s,342479,346000,the memory xmp profiles are locked in in
QBugQ7y1l9s,346000,347759,this case it's just a matter of changing
QBugQ7y1l9s,347759,350400,one setting and then besides that i also
QBugQ7y1l9s,350400,353840,like to undervolt 12th generation cpus
QBugQ7y1l9s,353840,356400,especially locked cpus and here's where
QBugQ7y1l9s,356400,359520,with the i5 12600 we settled with minus
QBugQ7y1l9s,359520,362479,20 millivolts usually with other cpus i
QBugQ7y1l9s,362479,365280,can get up to -100 millivolt but in this
QBugQ7y1l9s,365280,367919,case minus 20 millivolt is where this
QBugQ7y1l9s,367919,371199,cpu like to run stable whilst using less
QBugQ7y1l9s,371199,372720,power but still getting the maximum
QBugQ7y1l9s,372720,375280,performance possible then the last tweak
QBugQ7y1l9s,375280,377280,we did was with the graphics card where
QBugQ7y1l9s,377280,381120,we upped the vram speeds an extra 150
QBugQ7y1l9s,381120,384000,megahertz in the adrenaline software and
QBugQ7y1l9s,384000,385600,so running some stress tests with
QBugQ7y1l9s,385600,388800,cinebench r23 and also unigine heaven
QBugQ7y1l9s,388800,391440,showed that our pc was now stable and
QBugQ7y1l9s,391440,393840,ready to run those gaming benchmarks
QBugQ7y1l9s,393840,395360,where the first benchmark we're pulling
QBugQ7y1l9s,395360,398639,up here is valerant 1080p and i decided
QBugQ7y1l9s,398639,401360,to test both the lowest and maximum
QBugQ7y1l9s,401360,403600,settings just in case gearseekers is
QBugQ7y1l9s,403600,405520,doing some other settings we'll be able
QBugQ7y1l9s,405520,407919,to show the range of fps that we're
QBugQ7y1l9s,407919,410240,getting here and at the lowest settings
QBugQ7y1l9s,410240,413280,at 1080p we got 374
QBugQ7y1l9s,413280,417120,average fps and a one percent low of 198
QBugQ7y1l9s,417120,419599,and then a 0.1 percent low of 85. and
QBugQ7y1l9s,419599,421199,then putting the settings up all the way
QBugQ7y1l9s,421199,423639,to maximum we got here
QBugQ7y1l9s,423639,429039,366 average fps and then 187 and 37. so
QBugQ7y1l9s,429039,430639,this was a smooth experience but there
QBugQ7y1l9s,430639,432720,wasn't really any of a difference to be
QBugQ7y1l9s,432720,435039,had with lowering the graphics settings
QBugQ7y1l9s,435039,437599,so this game was becoming cpu bound but
QBugQ7y1l9s,437599,440240,the fps is extremely high you're gonna
QBugQ7y1l9s,440240,442560,get a very smooth experience in this
QBugQ7y1l9s,442560,444160,game the next title we've got up here is
QBugQ7y1l9s,444160,446160,cyberpunk and here's where we saw a
QBugQ7y1l9s,446160,447680,similar trend
QBugQ7y1l9s,447680,450599,to valorant with the low preset we got
QBugQ7y1l9s,450599,455039,164 average fps and then 107 and 72 on
QBugQ7y1l9s,455039,456960,the one percent 0.1 percent lows
QBugQ7y1l9s,456960,458880,respectively and moving over to max
QBugQ7y1l9s,458880,462960,settings we then got 162 101
QBugQ7y1l9s,462960,465520,and 61. though the next title we got
QBugQ7y1l9s,465520,468000,here is cs go and here's what we've got
QBugQ7y1l9s,468000,471360,with the lowest settings 526
QBugQ7y1l9s,471360,473199,and then a one percent low of 101 and
QBugQ7y1l9s,473199,475280,0.1 cent low of 90 and then stepping
QBugQ7y1l9s,475280,477599,things up to the maximum settings we got
QBugQ7y1l9s,477599,480000,here 473
QBugQ7y1l9s,480000,483120,82 and 76 so there was a little bit of a
QBugQ7y1l9s,483120,484800,difference to be had by dropping the
QBugQ7y1l9s,484800,486319,graphics settings but it wasn't making
QBugQ7y1l9s,486319,488720,much of a difference meaning that the i5
QBugQ7y1l9s,488720,491280,12 600 is pairing very nicely with the
QBugQ7y1l9s,491280,495360,6700 xt for maximum 1080p gaming moving
QBugQ7y1l9s,495360,498000,on to hitman 3 we had here on the lowest
QBugQ7y1l9s,498000,501800,settings we got 270 average fps and then
QBugQ7y1l9s,501800,505199,119 on the one percent lows then 111 on
QBugQ7y1l9s,505199,508080,the 0.1 lows go over to maximum settings
QBugQ7y1l9s,508080,512000,we had 119 and then 55 and 44. and then
QBugQ7y1l9s,512000,513680,the last title we tested here was
QBugQ7y1l9s,513680,516080,shadows of the tomb raider going with
QBugQ7y1l9s,516080,519279,low settings we had 207 fps and then a
QBugQ7y1l9s,519279,521919,minimum of 145 then over to the maximum
QBugQ7y1l9s,521919,526240,ultra preset here we had 156 and 121.
QBugQ7y1l9s,526240,527760,now we couldn't test the one percent and
QBugQ7y1l9s,527760,530240,0.1 lows in this game because it does
QBugQ7y1l9s,530240,531920,have these breaks in between the
QBugQ7y1l9s,531920,534000,benchmark sections so you'll get an
QBugQ7y1l9s,534000,536959,inaccurate result for the 1 0.1 lows and
QBugQ7y1l9s,536959,537839,now we're moving over to the
QBugQ7y1l9s,537839,539519,productivity benchmarks and first up
QBugQ7y1l9s,539519,541839,we've got the adobe suite the premiere
QBugQ7y1l9s,541839,544880,pro benchmark here is the puget bench
QBugQ7y1l9s,544880,547279,which is pretty much a set and forget
QBugQ7y1l9s,547279,549839,benchmark so gear seekers and i will
QBugQ7y1l9s,549839,551760,should have the exact same benchmark
QBugQ7y1l9s,551760,554000,running and so we got here a score of
QBugQ7y1l9s,554000,556080,921
QBugQ7y1l9s,556080,558640,points and then moving over to the
QBugQ7y1l9s,558640,561360,photoshop benchmark we then ended up
QBugQ7y1l9s,561360,562600,with a score of
QBugQ7y1l9s,562600,565519,899 points and then the last of the
QBugQ7y1l9s,565519,568320,adobe benchmarks was lightroom classic
QBugQ7y1l9s,568320,570920,and here we got a score of
QBugQ7y1l9s,570920,573760,1020 points and now in closing out with
QBugQ7y1l9s,573760,577040,this gaming pc i am extremely impressed
QBugQ7y1l9s,577040,580240,with what it can do in the gaming side
QBugQ7y1l9s,580240,581839,of things and for the productivity
QBugQ7y1l9s,581839,584320,scores they look pretty solid i mean
QBugQ7y1l9s,584320,586080,anything close to a thousand in the
QBugQ7y1l9s,586080,589040,puget bench benchmarks is pretty good
QBugQ7y1l9s,589040,591040,but that aside we've got a pc here
QBugQ7y1l9s,591040,593839,that's come in at 1500 aussie dollars
QBugQ7y1l9s,593839,595920,and it's absolutely amazing in what it
QBugQ7y1l9s,595920,598000,can do for 1080p gaming and with the
QBugQ7y1l9s,598000,599519,synergy of parts that we've used here
QBugQ7y1l9s,599519,602320,today we have gone full cookie cutter to
QBugQ7y1l9s,602320,605279,get in at that price point and produce
QBugQ7y1l9s,605279,608000,the best results now if i had the option
QBugQ7y1l9s,608000,610880,if i had a little bit more freedom in
QBugQ7y1l9s,610880,612720,terms of budget i would increase the
QBugQ7y1l9s,612720,615440,budget a little bit here and go for say
QBugQ7y1l9s,615440,618959,an asrock uh steel legend b660 and then
QBugQ7y1l9s,618959,621440,throw in another 16 gigabytes of memory
QBugQ7y1l9s,621440,623440,to make 32 gigabytes of memory and
QBugQ7y1l9s,623440,628000,perhaps then go with a 12 600 k or kf if
QBugQ7y1l9s,628000,630800,i was just gaming and add in a custom
QBugQ7y1l9s,630800,633120,cooler something like a snowman just to
QBugQ7y1l9s,633120,635360,keep the temperatures of the cpu a
QBugQ7y1l9s,635360,637440,little bit cooler than the stock cooler
QBugQ7y1l9s,637440,639680,and lastly i would add in a one terabyte
QBugQ7y1l9s,639680,642480,m.2 ssd and in total that would probably
QBugQ7y1l9s,642480,646560,increase my budget another 250 to 300
QBugQ7y1l9s,646560,648079,but in my opinion it would just make the
QBugQ7y1l9s,648079,650959,system much more relevant in terms of
QBugQ7y1l9s,650959,653440,being a higher end system especially not
QBugQ7y1l9s,653440,654800,just for gaming but for doing more
QBugQ7y1l9s,654800,657040,productivity work where i think 32
QBugQ7y1l9s,657040,659760,gigabytes is much more suitable for that
QBugQ7y1l9s,659760,661600,line of work though as it stands with
QBugQ7y1l9s,661600,663040,the performance numbers i'm very
QBugQ7y1l9s,663040,665120,impressed the motherboard was absolutely
QBugQ7y1l9s,665120,668240,fine handling the 12600 with that mini
QBugQ7y1l9s,668240,670160,overvolt that we did and then the gravis
QBugQ7y1l9s,670160,672480,card was just humming along with
QBugQ7y1l9s,672480,674480,temperatures around 60 degrees on pretty
QBugQ7y1l9s,674480,676000,much most of these benchmarks and this
QBugQ7y1l9s,676000,679040,is in a 24 c ambient environment here in
QBugQ7y1l9s,679040,681600,japan it's probably the temperature that
QBugQ7y1l9s,681600,683839,i like running at most the time around
QBugQ7y1l9s,683839,686800,22 to 25 degrees some people like it
QBugQ7y1l9s,686800,688959,cooler some people like it hotter i
QBugQ7y1l9s,688959,691680,think that's like my kellogg's it's just
QBugQ7y1l9s,691680,693440,right that's the cereal though that
QBugQ7y1l9s,693440,695279,aside do let us know in the comment
QBugQ7y1l9s,695279,696959,section below what you think of this
QBugQ7y1l9s,696959,699200,build right here i personally if i'm
QBugQ7y1l9s,699200,700959,going with a newer build nowadays
QBugQ7y1l9s,700959,702880,especially if i'm doing any productivity
QBugQ7y1l9s,702880,704880,work i actually do like to have that on
QBugQ7y1l9s,704880,708720,board gpu encoder available because when
QBugQ7y1l9s,708720,710560,you're streaming for example you can use
QBugQ7y1l9s,710560,712959,the quick sync and then free up the
QBugQ7y1l9s,712959,715279,extra resources on your gpu because
QBugQ7y1l9s,715279,717839,using the gpu encoder will take a little
QBugQ7y1l9s,717839,719519,bit of a hit on performance but if
QBugQ7y1l9s,719519,721440,you've got that free on-board gpu
QBugQ7y1l9s,721440,724560,portion from the 12600 in this case that
QBugQ7y1l9s,724560,726959,will free up some resources and if it's
QBugQ7y1l9s,726959,729200,being idle you might as well use it not
QBugQ7y1l9s,729200,731279,to mention you can use it in the future
QBugQ7y1l9s,731279,733760,to diagnose any problems and rule out
QBugQ7y1l9s,733760,735040,say for instance if a graphics card
QBugQ7y1l9s,735040,736639,becomes faulty in the future you can
QBugQ7y1l9s,736639,738880,easily test that by just resetting the
QBugQ7y1l9s,738880,741760,bios and then plugging out from the main
QBugQ7y1l9s,741760,744639,board so it is useful to have that gpu
QBugQ7y1l9s,744639,746480,but if you're just gaming then you can
QBugQ7y1l9s,746480,748959,always go with the f or the kf series
QBugQ7y1l9s,748959,751760,processors i do like what the 12th gen
QBugQ7y1l9s,751760,754240,has to offer in terms of flexibility and
QBugQ7y1l9s,754240,756800,especially if you're on a budget having
QBugQ7y1l9s,756800,759519,the option to go for ddr4 instead of
QBugQ7y1l9s,759519,762399,ddr5 is one of the best things that
QBugQ7y1l9s,762399,765120,intel's done with 12 generation for
QBugQ7y1l9s,765120,767519,people on a budget with that aside do
QBugQ7y1l9s,767519,769120,let us know if you would make some
QBugQ7y1l9s,769120,772000,changes at the 1500 price point or of
QBugQ7y1l9s,772000,773519,course if you had a bit more money spent
QBugQ7y1l9s,773519,775680,what would you change in this build love
QBugQ7y1l9s,775680,777519,reading your thoughts and opinions as
QBugQ7y1l9s,777519,779760,always and we'll get on to the question
QBugQ7y1l9s,779760,782880,of the day which comes from em random
QBugQ7y1l9s,782880,784720,studios and they ask since you're on a
QBugQ7y1l9s,784720,787680,visa extended was there anything about
QBugQ7y1l9s,787680,790800,filling out your work mandatory monetary
QBugQ7y1l9s,790800,793360,making process for the visa or the
QBugQ7y1l9s,793360,795040,apartment so in terms of be getting the
QBugQ7y1l9s,795040,797519,visa and even getting my apartment here
QBugQ7y1l9s,797519,799600,that was done through friends and family
QBugQ7y1l9s,799600,800639,so
QBugQ7y1l9s,800639,802880,it's pretty difficult to do it if you
QBugQ7y1l9s,802880,805360,haven't been to japan and so if you want
QBugQ7y1l9s,805360,807440,to get into japan the easiest way to do
QBugQ7y1l9s,807440,808959,that and even purchase apartments and
QBugQ7y1l9s,808959,811120,stuff like that is to come here on a
QBugQ7y1l9s,811120,813440,temporary visa say a tourist visa and
QBugQ7y1l9s,813440,814880,then while you're here you can maybe
QBugQ7y1l9s,814880,818320,find a job get a working visa and then
QBugQ7y1l9s,818320,821120,that will unlock your potential to buy
QBugQ7y1l9s,821120,824079,property and also live like a japanese
QBugQ7y1l9s,824079,826399,would and so that will unlock so many
QBugQ7y1l9s,826399,828800,more options that would be the best way
QBugQ7y1l9s,828800,830720,to get a foot in the door into japan so
QBugQ7y1l9s,830720,832399,i hope that answers that question and
QBugQ7y1l9s,832399,834320,also if you guys have stayed this far
