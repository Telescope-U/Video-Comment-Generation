KkFBipJUzVA,7839,10000,guess who now makes two
KkFBipJUzVA,10000,12400,front engined rear-wheel drive sports
KkFBipJUzVA,12400,14880,cars with good old-fashioned manual
KkFBipJUzVA,14880,18160,gearboxes yep it's toyota the people who
KkFBipJUzVA,18160,20400,make loads of dishwashers with wheels
KkFBipJUzVA,20400,23199,and the prius are now some of the last
KkFBipJUzVA,23199,25920,defenders of the classic analog sports
KkFBipJUzVA,25920,29039,car we've got the new gr supra with a
KkFBipJUzVA,29039,30400,manual gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,30400,34800,and the gr86 a proper back to basic
KkFBipJUzVA,34800,36239,sports car
KkFBipJUzVA,36239,38239,so now let's have a little civil war and
KkFBipJUzVA,38239,40640,find out which is best it's time for the
KkFBipJUzVA,40640,43280,real toyota sports car to please stand
KkFBipJUzVA,43280,45840,up
KkFBipJUzVA,49760,51360,okay we're straight into the supra here
KkFBipJUzVA,51360,53440,because we've not got a lot of time and
KkFBipJUzVA,53440,55120,thought we'd start with this car because
KkFBipJUzVA,55120,57360,it's a bit familiar to us isn't it and
KkFBipJUzVA,57360,59359,well i've been a bit disappointed by the
KkFBipJUzVA,59359,61120,supra so far i don't know about you but
KkFBipJUzVA,61120,64080,i have been thoroughly unconvinced by
KkFBipJUzVA,64080,66159,this latest generation of the supposedly
KkFBipJUzVA,66159,68159,legendary name and not because it's a
KkFBipJUzVA,68159,70479,bmw underneath i don't really mind that
KkFBipJUzVA,70479,72720,frankly it wouldn't exist without bmw's
KkFBipJUzVA,72720,74640,help and well if toyota had to design
KkFBipJUzVA,74640,76240,the interior they wouldn't have done it
KkFBipJUzVA,76240,79040,as nicely as this
KkFBipJUzVA,79040,80560,no i just had a problem with how the car
KkFBipJUzVA,80560,81840,drove frankly it's supposed to be a
KkFBipJUzVA,81840,84159,sports car but the supra felt heavy and
KkFBipJUzVA,84159,87520,lazy and well just a bit soft and
KkFBipJUzVA,87520,90159,unengaging forgettable really that's a
KkFBipJUzVA,90159,92960,crime so what have they done
KkFBipJUzVA,92960,94400,well first of all
KkFBipJUzVA,94400,96720,they've put a manual gearbox gone is
KkFBipJUzVA,96720,99439,that eight speed automatic you can still
KkFBipJUzVA,99439,101119,get it of course but now we've got a
KkFBipJUzVA,101119,103840,six-speed manual which i'm sure makes
KkFBipJUzVA,103840,105759,the car worse in lots of ways i mean
KkFBipJUzVA,105759,108000,it's gonna do fewer miles to the gallon
KkFBipJUzVA,108000,110720,it's gonna cruise less quietly it's
KkFBipJUzVA,110720,112479,gonna be more of a pain in traffic but
KkFBipJUzVA,112479,113680,so what
KkFBipJUzVA,113680,115119,at least you can now
KkFBipJUzVA,115119,116880,well you can be in control with your
KkFBipJUzVA,116880,118719,hand of what that three liter turbo
KkFBipJUzVA,118719,119759,charged
KkFBipJUzVA,119759,122240,straight six is up to
KkFBipJUzVA,122240,124079,some really nerdy stuff has gone on with
KkFBipJUzVA,124079,126880,the supra it's got lighter alloy wheels
KkFBipJUzVA,126880,129119,even the hi-fi has been made lighter so
KkFBipJUzVA,129119,130560,the revised model with the manual
KkFBipJUzVA,130560,134000,gearbox is 38.3 kilos lighter than it
KkFBipJUzVA,134000,136080,was when it was launched okay it's still
KkFBipJUzVA,136080,138640,one and a half tons so you're not
KkFBipJUzVA,138640,141200,calling it a lightweight sports car but
KkFBipJUzVA,141200,143120,it all helps go in the right direction
KkFBipJUzVA,143120,145760,and when the gr86 arrives breathing down
KkFBipJUzVA,145760,148319,this thing's neck with its purest
KkFBipJUzVA,148319,150879,approach to sports car motoring
KkFBipJUzVA,150879,153519,the supra needs all the help it can get
KkFBipJUzVA,153519,155599,the suspension's been fiddled with the
KkFBipJUzVA,155599,157519,electric power steering tweaked to make
KkFBipJUzVA,157519,159360,it keener to change direction and even
KkFBipJUzVA,159360,161360,the driver aids have got a bit more of a
KkFBipJUzVA,161360,162720,sense of humor
KkFBipJUzVA,162720,164480,i'm enjoying this shift as well maybe
KkFBipJUzVA,164480,167120,it's not quite as world-class as the
KkFBipJUzVA,167120,168959,gear shift you get in a porsche cayman
KkFBipJUzVA,168959,171120,or honda civic type r that's about as
KkFBipJUzVA,171120,174080,good as manuals get but it's a nice one
KkFBipJUzVA,174080,175120,and they've actually done some really
KkFBipJUzVA,175120,176720,nerdy stuff too
KkFBipJUzVA,176720,179680,there's three different weights of gear
KkFBipJUzVA,179680,182159,lever that toyota tried for this car
KkFBipJUzVA,182159,184239,they started off with i think it was 68
KkFBipJUzVA,184239,186640,grams then they went to 130 and they
KkFBipJUzVA,186640,190400,went for a 200 gram gear lever because
KkFBipJUzVA,190400,192400,that gave a higher quality shift that is
KkFBipJUzVA,192400,195440,gordon murray levels of geekery when it
KkFBipJUzVA,195440,197200,comes to ensuring you have a nice
KkFBipJUzVA,197200,200159,feeling shift and i'm here for that
KkFBipJUzVA,200159,201599,so this is only a very quick first
KkFBipJUzVA,201599,203519,impression of course we'll spend more
KkFBipJUzVA,203519,206000,time in this manual supra in the months
KkFBipJUzVA,206000,208239,and years to come but
KkFBipJUzVA,208239,209760,yeah i've driven a few supra's never
KkFBipJUzVA,209760,212560,been convinced but i've enjoyed this one
KkFBipJUzVA,212560,215040,more than any super driven so far the
KkFBipJUzVA,215040,217040,standard three liter car just didn't get
KkFBipJUzVA,217040,219519,on with tried the two liter and yes it
KkFBipJUzVA,219519,221840,takes some weight out the nose but
KkFBipJUzVA,221840,224640,it's hardly night and day better but
KkFBipJUzVA,224640,228560,some tweaks some just choice changes and
KkFBipJUzVA,228560,231440,crucially letting me diy
KkFBipJUzVA,231440,233519,my own gears with a stick shift a
KkFBipJUzVA,233519,235680,supra's go this
KkFBipJUzVA,235680,238239,is an enjoyable one
KkFBipJUzVA,238239,240400,the supra has been improved then but
KkFBipJUzVA,240400,242159,we'll have to wait until we're not on a
KkFBipJUzVA,242159,244319,baking hot spanish race track to be
KkFBipJUzVA,244319,245680,completely sure
KkFBipJUzVA,245680,248560,now what about its little brother
KkFBipJUzVA,248560,250239,much as i love my job there are some
KkFBipJUzVA,250239,252000,cars that you find yourself
KkFBipJUzVA,252000,253680,really looking forward to
KkFBipJUzVA,253680,255599,and this is definitely one of them the
KkFBipJUzVA,255599,259120,successor to the toyota gt 86 the back
KkFBipJUzVA,259120,261280,to basics rear wheel drive sports car
KkFBipJUzVA,261280,266199,this is the new toyota gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,268880,271759,right welcome inside now all gr86s that
KkFBipJUzVA,271759,274080,are coming to the uk pretty well kitted
KkFBipJUzVA,274080,276479,out there's led lights all around
KkFBipJUzVA,276479,278800,there's a reversing camera at the back
KkFBipJUzVA,278800,280400,and then what we've got in here look
KkFBipJUzVA,280400,283280,there's keyless starts cruise control
KkFBipJUzVA,283280,284960,heated seats
KkFBipJUzVA,284960,287199,you can plug your phone in down here and
KkFBipJUzVA,287199,289280,that gives you android auto or apple
KkFBipJUzVA,289280,291199,carplay in the screen which is great
KkFBipJUzVA,291199,292880,because it means you don't have to use
KkFBipJUzVA,292880,295120,toyota's interface and the rest of it
KkFBipJUzVA,295120,296400,well got
KkFBipJUzVA,296400,298800,buttons and switches for my dual zone
KkFBipJUzVA,298800,301199,climate control i like that all sorts of
KkFBipJUzVA,301199,303120,readouts in the new digital display
KkFBipJUzVA,303120,305520,which looks cooler than it did in the
KkFBipJUzVA,305520,307360,old gt86
KkFBipJUzVA,307360,308560,the only thing that hasn't really taken
KkFBipJUzVA,308560,311280,a step on is yeah it's this isn't it
KkFBipJUzVA,311280,314080,it's the materials doesn't feel like an
KkFBipJUzVA,314080,316639,expensive car crucially it isn't an
KkFBipJUzVA,316639,318560,expensive car it's not supposed to be an
KkFBipJUzVA,318560,320240,audi tt inside that's why i don't mind
KkFBipJUzVA,320240,321759,that all these buttons down here look
KkFBipJUzVA,321759,324160,like they're made of lego because this
KkFBipJUzVA,324160,326479,costs under 30 grand when it went on
KkFBipJUzVA,326479,329600,sale at 29.995 for the one kitted out
KkFBipJUzVA,329600,332240,spec in the uk toyota sold out all of
KkFBipJUzVA,332240,335840,its gr86s for brits for two years in an
KkFBipJUzVA,335840,338080,hour and a half just proves that there
KkFBipJUzVA,338080,340560,is so much demand for back to basic
KkFBipJUzVA,340560,342560,sports cars out there you've just got to
KkFBipJUzVA,342560,344720,price them where people can reach them
KkFBipJUzVA,344720,346800,in the back toyota says there's room for
KkFBipJUzVA,346800,348560,four spare tyres if you flip the seats
KkFBipJUzVA,348560,350240,down so that's handy if you go into a
KkFBipJUzVA,350240,352800,track day but if you have the seats up
KkFBipJUzVA,352800,354880,then there's really not any room for
KkFBipJUzVA,354880,356319,even children
KkFBipJUzVA,356319,357840,still if you're trying to talk yourself
KkFBipJUzVA,357840,360639,into one the gr86 is practical enough
KkFBipJUzVA,360639,362560,for a sports coupe but what really
KkFBipJUzVA,362560,366080,matters is how it goes stops and steers
KkFBipJUzVA,366080,368880,now that's the sound of a boxer engine a
KkFBipJUzVA,368880,369610,flat four
KkFBipJUzVA,369610,372709,[Music]
KkFBipJUzVA,378160,381360,it's the successor of course to the gt86
KkFBipJUzVA,381360,384479,a previous top gear car of the year a
KkFBipJUzVA,384479,386160,car we liked for bringing rear-wheel
KkFBipJUzVA,386160,388800,drive kind of back to the masses but it
KkFBipJUzVA,388800,390880,wasn't perfect and one of its chief
KkFBipJUzVA,390880,392000,flaws
KkFBipJUzVA,392000,394560,being a co-developed car with subaru
KkFBipJUzVA,394560,397600,was that it's flat 4 subaru engine very
KkFBipJUzVA,397600,400160,low center of gravity purist normally
KkFBipJUzVA,400160,402479,aspirated all very honorable but
KkFBipJUzVA,402479,404639,just didn't have much torque
KkFBipJUzVA,404639,406160,made it feel like you were thrashing the
KkFBipJUzVA,406160,409199,car the whole time so for this second
KkFBipJUzVA,409199,412319,generation car if you like the gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,412319,415840,well they've kept that purest philosophy
KkFBipJUzVA,415840,419039,they've not put in the gr yaris's
KkFBipJUzVA,419039,421360,turbocharged engine but they've brought
KkFBipJUzVA,421360,424160,this engine out 2.4 liters now so there
KkFBipJUzVA,424160,426479,you go look left it in third and it
KkFBipJUzVA,426479,429039,picked up we're now up to about 184
KkFBipJUzVA,429039,431599,pounds feet of torque it's not going to
KkFBipJUzVA,431599,434080,punt you up the road like some sort of
KkFBipJUzVA,434080,436960,turbo hybrid electric nutter
KkFBipJUzVA,436960,438639,but it can now slightly get out of its
KkFBipJUzVA,438639,440160,own way and look if you put the power on
KkFBipJUzVA,440160,441680,in the middle of a corner
KkFBipJUzVA,441680,443680,you can keep the tail up properly even
KkFBipJUzVA,443680,445759,in the dry when your tires are hot
KkFBipJUzVA,445759,448080,basically it's fun without going insane
KkFBipJUzVA,448080,450960,speeds the gr86 is a second quicker from
KkFBipJUzVA,450960,453199,north to 60 than the old gt86 and it
KkFBipJUzVA,453199,455840,will do 140 miles an hour but there's no
KkFBipJUzVA,455840,457919,car you can imagine that's less about
KkFBipJUzVA,457919,459440,the numbers
KkFBipJUzVA,459440,463840,so this new gr86 will do north to 60 and
KkFBipJUzVA,463840,465840,seconds you can have an automatic which
KkFBipJUzVA,465840,467599,is slightly slower but with all that
KkFBipJUzVA,467599,469599,power going to the rear wheels if you
KkFBipJUzVA,469599,472080,are medically able please please go for
KkFBipJUzVA,472080,474319,the manual it's a cracker
KkFBipJUzVA,474319,476080,really nice doesn't feel as notchy as i
KkFBipJUzVA,476080,480240,remember the old gt 86 feeling
KkFBipJUzVA,480240,481360,but there is
KkFBipJUzVA,481360,484560,obviously some familiarity here in
KkFBipJUzVA,484560,487199,similar kind of suspension settings the
KkFBipJUzVA,487199,489840,body is obviously very similar
KkFBipJUzVA,489840,491360,dimensions as well although wherever
KkFBipJUzVA,491360,492720,it's just slightly lower and apparently
KkFBipJUzVA,492720,495680,you sit a bit lower as well but yeah the
KkFBipJUzVA,495680,497840,driving experience feels
KkFBipJUzVA,497840,500080,like the gt did but every little bit has
KkFBipJUzVA,500080,502479,been made a little bit better
KkFBipJUzVA,502479,504560,if you're sick of the hypercar power
KkFBipJUzVA,504560,506879,wars and classic cars with values rising
KkFBipJUzVA,506879,509039,faster than fuel prices this is the
KkFBipJUzVA,509039,510879,machine you've been waiting for it's
KkFBipJUzVA,510879,513120,just a pity it's sold out so fast and
KkFBipJUzVA,513120,514560,it's only going to be on sale for a
KkFBipJUzVA,514560,516640,couple of years in the uk if you're
KkFBipJUzVA,516640,518159,thinking
KkFBipJUzVA,518159,520399,also sounds a bit meaty than it did
KkFBipJUzVA,520399,521760,before there's some interesting stuff
KkFBipJUzVA,521760,523680,going on there that you might not like
KkFBipJUzVA,523680,525839,you see in the gt86 there was a pipe
KkFBipJUzVA,525839,527360,coming off the engine that was just
KkFBipJUzVA,527360,530240,designed to sort of burp engine noise
KkFBipJUzVA,530240,532480,into your face
KkFBipJUzVA,532480,534000,problem is that did make the car quite
KkFBipJUzVA,534000,535600,unrefined on the motorway so what
KkFBipJUzVA,535600,538080,they've done this time is they've piped
KkFBipJUzVA,538080,540320,the engine noise through the speakers
KkFBipJUzVA,540320,541839,now that means you can have more engine
KkFBipJUzVA,541839,544399,noise when you're holding
KkFBipJUzVA,544399,545760,into the red line
KkFBipJUzVA,545760,547120,but when you say cruising on the
KkFBipJUzVA,547120,549279,motorway they can turn it down maybe
KkFBipJUzVA,549279,551839,that's not quite as authentic and purist
KkFBipJUzVA,551839,553839,as the old car was but
KkFBipJUzVA,553839,555279,i don't know
KkFBipJUzVA,555279,557680,sports cars are becoming a bit of a
KkFBipJUzVA,557680,559120,a last chance salute at the moment
KkFBipJUzVA,559120,560880,they're not going to be around forever
KkFBipJUzVA,560880,562959,and especially ones with rear drive
KkFBipJUzVA,562959,565279,manual gearboxes and all the purest
KkFBipJUzVA,565279,569120,stuff that people love to get ever so
KkFBipJUzVA,569120,570399,choked up about
KkFBipJUzVA,570399,571279,so
KkFBipJUzVA,571279,573360,makes a half decent noise
KkFBipJUzVA,573360,574880,doesn't sound that anti-social there's
KkFBipJUzVA,574880,578160,no fake hops and bangs
KkFBipJUzVA,578160,579040,yeah
KkFBipJUzVA,579040,580880,i'm enjoying the noise
KkFBipJUzVA,580880,582320,i'm enjoying all of it to be honest with
KkFBipJUzVA,582320,583279,you
KkFBipJUzVA,583279,584720,since we're on the track i've got the
KkFBipJUzVA,584720,586720,stability control in the track setting
KkFBipJUzVA,586720,588800,so the car's nice and playful and it's
KkFBipJUzVA,588800,591200,super approachable what's nice as well
KkFBipJUzVA,591200,593760,is that i'd never driven the new gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,593760,595600,before this morning i'd also never
KkFBipJUzVA,595600,597920,driven this circuit but i've jumped into
KkFBipJUzVA,597920,600640,it and within a lap and a half
KkFBipJUzVA,600640,602800,you get the traction control off and you
KkFBipJUzVA,602800,605279,just start having a laugh i feel like
KkFBipJUzVA,605279,606720,you could get into this ten minutes
KkFBipJUzVA,606720,608720,after you passed your driving test and
KkFBipJUzVA,608720,610720,you would fundamentally understand what
KkFBipJUzVA,610720,614079,makes sports cars a joy to drive or you
KkFBipJUzVA,614079,615920,could put formula one world champion in
KkFBipJUzVA,615920,617120,here
KkFBipJUzVA,617120,619760,and they would appreciate the natural
KkFBipJUzVA,619760,623040,sense of of balance and how involved you
KkFBipJUzVA,623040,625360,as the driver feel chucking this little
KkFBipJUzVA,625360,627440,sports car around
KkFBipJUzVA,627440,630399,if you want more punch then now go and
KkFBipJUzVA,630399,632079,have a supra because it's now got a
KkFBipJUzVA,632079,634399,manual it now feels a little bit better
KkFBipJUzVA,634399,638000,sorted a bit more tied down but for me
KkFBipJUzVA,638000,640959,at 30 grand this is so
KkFBipJUzVA,640959,643200,much fun and there's no gimmicks there's
KkFBipJUzVA,643200,646320,no drift mode there's no sort of extra
KkFBipJUzVA,646320,649519,settings okay i can have a g meter on my
KkFBipJUzVA,649519,651440,dashboard but that's about it
KkFBipJUzVA,651440,654640,fundamentally what's fun in here is the
KkFBipJUzVA,654640,657200,handling so although i'm supposed to
KkFBipJUzVA,657200,659040,have gone to the pit lane now
KkFBipJUzVA,659040,661040,i'm gonna keep going until they tell me
KkFBipJUzVA,661040,661550,to come in
KkFBipJUzVA,661550,664480,[Music]
KkFBipJUzVA,664480,666079,while it's still got some rubber left on
KkFBipJUzVA,666079,668320,its tyres let's pop out onto the road
KkFBipJUzVA,668320,670720,see if the gr86 can still cut it where
KkFBipJUzVA,670720,672800,it's going to spend most of its life
KkFBipJUzVA,672800,674560,what's great is when you get yourself on
KkFBipJUzVA,674560,677200,a great trip to road like we're on now
KkFBipJUzVA,677200,678880,okay you're not kicking the tail out or
KkFBipJUzVA,678880,680320,trying to smoke the tires at all but
KkFBipJUzVA,680320,682320,there's still just lots to enjoy this is
KkFBipJUzVA,682320,684640,a fun car to pour through a corner it
KkFBipJUzVA,684640,686880,doesn't take up much space on the road
KkFBipJUzVA,686880,689519,so you've got lots of lane to play with
KkFBipJUzVA,689519,692079,the visibility is fantastic this gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,692079,694079,i just find myself changing gear for the
KkFBipJUzVA,694079,696560,hell of it it's not the finest shift
KkFBipJUzVA,696560,699600,i've ever experienced but i'll take it
KkFBipJUzVA,699600,702480,it's a good manual box in a really great
KkFBipJUzVA,702480,705200,chassis what sets really good driver's
KkFBipJUzVA,705200,707920,cars apart for me is when it feels like
KkFBipJUzVA,707920,709440,all of their disparate elements have
KkFBipJUzVA,709440,712079,been set up by people who absolutely
KkFBipJUzVA,712079,714320,agreed on how they should feel so the
KkFBipJUzVA,714320,716880,steering weight the pedal weights the
KkFBipJUzVA,716880,719680,sensation of the shift and just the
KkFBipJUzVA,719680,721519,speed at which the car gives you
KkFBipJUzVA,721519,724000,feedback it all matches in here it's
KkFBipJUzVA,724000,726880,just really cohesive and that makes it
KkFBipJUzVA,726880,728839,enjoyable and it gives you
KkFBipJUzVA,728839,730399,confidence
KkFBipJUzVA,730399,732240,on the road it's where you really notice
KkFBipJUzVA,732240,734240,that extra mid-range torque okay it's
KkFBipJUzVA,734240,737760,only 184 pounds feet this is by no means
KkFBipJUzVA,737760,739920,some sort of you know tug boat that
KkFBipJUzVA,739920,742880,could pull oak trees over but it does
KkFBipJUzVA,742880,745279,the job and you stay on the boil that
KkFBipJUzVA,745279,748079,much easier than in the gt86 where at
KkFBipJUzVA,748079,750720,about 4000 rpm where we are now
KkFBipJUzVA,750720,753120,used to kind of tumble head first into a
KkFBipJUzVA,753120,758440,talk hole here now it keeps pulling
KkFBipJUzVA,758959,761440,could you live with this car i mean it's
KkFBipJUzVA,761440,763600,very uncomplicated that's something you
KkFBipJUzVA,763600,765600,should really focus on about the gr
KkFBipJUzVA,765600,767839,there's not too many modes and different
KkFBipJUzVA,767839,769680,ways of setting it up there's no comfort
KkFBipJUzVA,769680,771360,or rate setting for the suspension
KkFBipJUzVA,771360,774399,there's one setting from the factory and
KkFBipJUzVA,774399,776639,does the job fine
KkFBipJUzVA,776639,778480,okay no one who drops into that seat
KkFBipJUzVA,778480,779760,there is your passenger is going to be
KkFBipJUzVA,779760,781600,wowed by this interior but it is at
KkFBipJUzVA,781600,783680,least well made it's well put together
KkFBipJUzVA,783680,786160,it's practical there's plenty of storage
KkFBipJUzVA,786160,788240,these seats i like to sit a little bit
KkFBipJUzVA,788240,790399,lower maybe but in terms of support
KkFBipJUzVA,790399,792160,around the shoulders around the hips
KkFBipJUzVA,792160,794399,they're fantastic proper sports cars
KkFBipJUzVA,794399,796399,should have proper seats you can check
KkFBipJUzVA,796399,798800,that box for the gr
KkFBipJUzVA,798800,800240,and then it just comes back to the price
KkFBipJUzVA,800240,803920,at 300 quid a month or just under 30
KkFBipJUzVA,803920,805760,grand for the rrp
KkFBipJUzVA,805760,807839,i'm glad that they didn't swave it in
KkFBipJUzVA,807839,809760,leather and big fillets of aluminium and
KkFBipJUzVA,809760,812800,then charged me more money for it
KkFBipJUzVA,812800,814639,just wish i'd got a deposit down in time
KkFBipJUzVA,814639,816399,really the fact that this thing is sold
KkFBipJUzVA,816399,817279,out
KkFBipJUzVA,817279,819199,proves that toronto is on to a winner
KkFBipJUzVA,819199,821760,with how it priced and pitched this car
KkFBipJUzVA,821760,823920,and if you are getting one
KkFBipJUzVA,823920,825600,i think you're really really gonna like
KkFBipJUzVA,825600,827040,it
KkFBipJUzVA,827040,828480,i said i was really looking forward to
KkFBipJUzVA,828480,831440,driving the gr86 and after the track and
KkFBipJUzVA,831440,833760,the road it absolutely hasn't let me
KkFBipJUzVA,833760,835279,down
KkFBipJUzVA,835279,837600,it's not been a terrible day driving
KkFBipJUzVA,837600,839360,toyotas there are many years when you
KkFBipJUzVA,839360,840959,couldn't say that so what do we think
KkFBipJUzVA,840959,843360,well the supra i love the manual gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,843360,845519,and i am heartened by the fact toyota is
KkFBipJUzVA,845519,847199,determined to improve
KkFBipJUzVA,847199,850079,its flagship sports car but for 20 grand
KkFBipJUzVA,850079,853279,less the gr86 wow it's not just the best
KkFBipJUzVA,853279,855279,sports car that toyota makes it's a
KkFBipJUzVA,855279,857360,great way for the petrol engine sports
KkFBipJUzVA,857360,861480,car to go out on a hike
vid,start,end,text
KkFBipJUzVA,7839,10000,guess who now makes two
KkFBipJUzVA,10000,12400,front engined rear-wheel drive sports
KkFBipJUzVA,12400,14880,cars with good old-fashioned manual
KkFBipJUzVA,14880,18160,gearboxes yep it's toyota the people who
KkFBipJUzVA,18160,20400,make loads of dishwashers with wheels
KkFBipJUzVA,20400,23199,and the prius are now some of the last
KkFBipJUzVA,23199,25920,defenders of the classic analog sports
KkFBipJUzVA,25920,29039,car we've got the new gr supra with a
KkFBipJUzVA,29039,30400,manual gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,30400,34800,and the gr86 a proper back to basic
KkFBipJUzVA,34800,36239,sports car
KkFBipJUzVA,36239,38239,so now let's have a little civil war and
KkFBipJUzVA,38239,40640,find out which is best it's time for the
KkFBipJUzVA,40640,43280,real toyota sports car to please stand
KkFBipJUzVA,43280,45840,up
KkFBipJUzVA,49760,51360,okay we're straight into the supra here
KkFBipJUzVA,51360,53440,because we've not got a lot of time and
KkFBipJUzVA,53440,55120,thought we'd start with this car because
KkFBipJUzVA,55120,57360,it's a bit familiar to us isn't it and
KkFBipJUzVA,57360,59359,well i've been a bit disappointed by the
KkFBipJUzVA,59359,61120,supra so far i don't know about you but
KkFBipJUzVA,61120,64080,i have been thoroughly unconvinced by
KkFBipJUzVA,64080,66159,this latest generation of the supposedly
KkFBipJUzVA,66159,68159,legendary name and not because it's a
KkFBipJUzVA,68159,70479,bmw underneath i don't really mind that
KkFBipJUzVA,70479,72720,frankly it wouldn't exist without bmw's
KkFBipJUzVA,72720,74640,help and well if toyota had to design
KkFBipJUzVA,74640,76240,the interior they wouldn't have done it
KkFBipJUzVA,76240,79040,as nicely as this
KkFBipJUzVA,79040,80560,no i just had a problem with how the car
KkFBipJUzVA,80560,81840,drove frankly it's supposed to be a
KkFBipJUzVA,81840,84159,sports car but the supra felt heavy and
KkFBipJUzVA,84159,87520,lazy and well just a bit soft and
KkFBipJUzVA,87520,90159,unengaging forgettable really that's a
KkFBipJUzVA,90159,92960,crime so what have they done
KkFBipJUzVA,92960,94400,well first of all
KkFBipJUzVA,94400,96720,they've put a manual gearbox gone is
KkFBipJUzVA,96720,99439,that eight speed automatic you can still
KkFBipJUzVA,99439,101119,get it of course but now we've got a
KkFBipJUzVA,101119,103840,six-speed manual which i'm sure makes
KkFBipJUzVA,103840,105759,the car worse in lots of ways i mean
KkFBipJUzVA,105759,108000,it's gonna do fewer miles to the gallon
KkFBipJUzVA,108000,110720,it's gonna cruise less quietly it's
KkFBipJUzVA,110720,112479,gonna be more of a pain in traffic but
KkFBipJUzVA,112479,113680,so what
KkFBipJUzVA,113680,115119,at least you can now
KkFBipJUzVA,115119,116880,well you can be in control with your
KkFBipJUzVA,116880,118719,hand of what that three liter turbo
KkFBipJUzVA,118719,119759,charged
KkFBipJUzVA,119759,122240,straight six is up to
KkFBipJUzVA,122240,124079,some really nerdy stuff has gone on with
KkFBipJUzVA,124079,126880,the supra it's got lighter alloy wheels
KkFBipJUzVA,126880,129119,even the hi-fi has been made lighter so
KkFBipJUzVA,129119,130560,the revised model with the manual
KkFBipJUzVA,130560,134000,gearbox is 38.3 kilos lighter than it
KkFBipJUzVA,134000,136080,was when it was launched okay it's still
KkFBipJUzVA,136080,138640,one and a half tons so you're not
KkFBipJUzVA,138640,141200,calling it a lightweight sports car but
KkFBipJUzVA,141200,143120,it all helps go in the right direction
KkFBipJUzVA,143120,145760,and when the gr86 arrives breathing down
KkFBipJUzVA,145760,148319,this thing's neck with its purest
KkFBipJUzVA,148319,150879,approach to sports car motoring
KkFBipJUzVA,150879,153519,the supra needs all the help it can get
KkFBipJUzVA,153519,155599,the suspension's been fiddled with the
KkFBipJUzVA,155599,157519,electric power steering tweaked to make
KkFBipJUzVA,157519,159360,it keener to change direction and even
KkFBipJUzVA,159360,161360,the driver aids have got a bit more of a
KkFBipJUzVA,161360,162720,sense of humor
KkFBipJUzVA,162720,164480,i'm enjoying this shift as well maybe
KkFBipJUzVA,164480,167120,it's not quite as world-class as the
KkFBipJUzVA,167120,168959,gear shift you get in a porsche cayman
KkFBipJUzVA,168959,171120,or honda civic type r that's about as
KkFBipJUzVA,171120,174080,good as manuals get but it's a nice one
KkFBipJUzVA,174080,175120,and they've actually done some really
KkFBipJUzVA,175120,176720,nerdy stuff too
KkFBipJUzVA,176720,179680,there's three different weights of gear
KkFBipJUzVA,179680,182159,lever that toyota tried for this car
KkFBipJUzVA,182159,184239,they started off with i think it was 68
KkFBipJUzVA,184239,186640,grams then they went to 130 and they
KkFBipJUzVA,186640,190400,went for a 200 gram gear lever because
KkFBipJUzVA,190400,192400,that gave a higher quality shift that is
KkFBipJUzVA,192400,195440,gordon murray levels of geekery when it
KkFBipJUzVA,195440,197200,comes to ensuring you have a nice
KkFBipJUzVA,197200,200159,feeling shift and i'm here for that
KkFBipJUzVA,200159,201599,so this is only a very quick first
KkFBipJUzVA,201599,203519,impression of course we'll spend more
KkFBipJUzVA,203519,206000,time in this manual supra in the months
KkFBipJUzVA,206000,208239,and years to come but
KkFBipJUzVA,208239,209760,yeah i've driven a few supra's never
KkFBipJUzVA,209760,212560,been convinced but i've enjoyed this one
KkFBipJUzVA,212560,215040,more than any super driven so far the
KkFBipJUzVA,215040,217040,standard three liter car just didn't get
KkFBipJUzVA,217040,219519,on with tried the two liter and yes it
KkFBipJUzVA,219519,221840,takes some weight out the nose but
KkFBipJUzVA,221840,224640,it's hardly night and day better but
KkFBipJUzVA,224640,228560,some tweaks some just choice changes and
KkFBipJUzVA,228560,231440,crucially letting me diy
KkFBipJUzVA,231440,233519,my own gears with a stick shift a
KkFBipJUzVA,233519,235680,supra's go this
KkFBipJUzVA,235680,238239,is an enjoyable one
KkFBipJUzVA,238239,240400,the supra has been improved then but
KkFBipJUzVA,240400,242159,we'll have to wait until we're not on a
KkFBipJUzVA,242159,244319,baking hot spanish race track to be
KkFBipJUzVA,244319,245680,completely sure
KkFBipJUzVA,245680,248560,now what about its little brother
KkFBipJUzVA,248560,250239,much as i love my job there are some
KkFBipJUzVA,250239,252000,cars that you find yourself
KkFBipJUzVA,252000,253680,really looking forward to
KkFBipJUzVA,253680,255599,and this is definitely one of them the
KkFBipJUzVA,255599,259120,successor to the toyota gt 86 the back
KkFBipJUzVA,259120,261280,to basics rear wheel drive sports car
KkFBipJUzVA,261280,266199,this is the new toyota gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,268880,271759,right welcome inside now all gr86s that
KkFBipJUzVA,271759,274080,are coming to the uk pretty well kitted
KkFBipJUzVA,274080,276479,out there's led lights all around
KkFBipJUzVA,276479,278800,there's a reversing camera at the back
KkFBipJUzVA,278800,280400,and then what we've got in here look
KkFBipJUzVA,280400,283280,there's keyless starts cruise control
KkFBipJUzVA,283280,284960,heated seats
KkFBipJUzVA,284960,287199,you can plug your phone in down here and
KkFBipJUzVA,287199,289280,that gives you android auto or apple
KkFBipJUzVA,289280,291199,carplay in the screen which is great
KkFBipJUzVA,291199,292880,because it means you don't have to use
KkFBipJUzVA,292880,295120,toyota's interface and the rest of it
KkFBipJUzVA,295120,296400,well got
KkFBipJUzVA,296400,298800,buttons and switches for my dual zone
KkFBipJUzVA,298800,301199,climate control i like that all sorts of
KkFBipJUzVA,301199,303120,readouts in the new digital display
KkFBipJUzVA,303120,305520,which looks cooler than it did in the
KkFBipJUzVA,305520,307360,old gt86
KkFBipJUzVA,307360,308560,the only thing that hasn't really taken
KkFBipJUzVA,308560,311280,a step on is yeah it's this isn't it
KkFBipJUzVA,311280,314080,it's the materials doesn't feel like an
KkFBipJUzVA,314080,316639,expensive car crucially it isn't an
KkFBipJUzVA,316639,318560,expensive car it's not supposed to be an
KkFBipJUzVA,318560,320240,audi tt inside that's why i don't mind
KkFBipJUzVA,320240,321759,that all these buttons down here look
KkFBipJUzVA,321759,324160,like they're made of lego because this
KkFBipJUzVA,324160,326479,costs under 30 grand when it went on
KkFBipJUzVA,326479,329600,sale at 29.995 for the one kitted out
KkFBipJUzVA,329600,332240,spec in the uk toyota sold out all of
KkFBipJUzVA,332240,335840,its gr86s for brits for two years in an
KkFBipJUzVA,335840,338080,hour and a half just proves that there
KkFBipJUzVA,338080,340560,is so much demand for back to basic
KkFBipJUzVA,340560,342560,sports cars out there you've just got to
KkFBipJUzVA,342560,344720,price them where people can reach them
KkFBipJUzVA,344720,346800,in the back toyota says there's room for
KkFBipJUzVA,346800,348560,four spare tyres if you flip the seats
KkFBipJUzVA,348560,350240,down so that's handy if you go into a
KkFBipJUzVA,350240,352800,track day but if you have the seats up
KkFBipJUzVA,352800,354880,then there's really not any room for
KkFBipJUzVA,354880,356319,even children
KkFBipJUzVA,356319,357840,still if you're trying to talk yourself
KkFBipJUzVA,357840,360639,into one the gr86 is practical enough
KkFBipJUzVA,360639,362560,for a sports coupe but what really
KkFBipJUzVA,362560,366080,matters is how it goes stops and steers
KkFBipJUzVA,366080,368880,now that's the sound of a boxer engine a
KkFBipJUzVA,368880,369610,flat four
KkFBipJUzVA,369610,372709,[Music]
KkFBipJUzVA,378160,381360,it's the successor of course to the gt86
KkFBipJUzVA,381360,384479,a previous top gear car of the year a
KkFBipJUzVA,384479,386160,car we liked for bringing rear-wheel
KkFBipJUzVA,386160,388800,drive kind of back to the masses but it
KkFBipJUzVA,388800,390880,wasn't perfect and one of its chief
KkFBipJUzVA,390880,392000,flaws
KkFBipJUzVA,392000,394560,being a co-developed car with subaru
KkFBipJUzVA,394560,397600,was that it's flat 4 subaru engine very
KkFBipJUzVA,397600,400160,low center of gravity purist normally
KkFBipJUzVA,400160,402479,aspirated all very honorable but
KkFBipJUzVA,402479,404639,just didn't have much torque
KkFBipJUzVA,404639,406160,made it feel like you were thrashing the
KkFBipJUzVA,406160,409199,car the whole time so for this second
KkFBipJUzVA,409199,412319,generation car if you like the gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,412319,415840,well they've kept that purest philosophy
KkFBipJUzVA,415840,419039,they've not put in the gr yaris's
KkFBipJUzVA,419039,421360,turbocharged engine but they've brought
KkFBipJUzVA,421360,424160,this engine out 2.4 liters now so there
KkFBipJUzVA,424160,426479,you go look left it in third and it
KkFBipJUzVA,426479,429039,picked up we're now up to about 184
KkFBipJUzVA,429039,431599,pounds feet of torque it's not going to
KkFBipJUzVA,431599,434080,punt you up the road like some sort of
KkFBipJUzVA,434080,436960,turbo hybrid electric nutter
KkFBipJUzVA,436960,438639,but it can now slightly get out of its
KkFBipJUzVA,438639,440160,own way and look if you put the power on
KkFBipJUzVA,440160,441680,in the middle of a corner
KkFBipJUzVA,441680,443680,you can keep the tail up properly even
KkFBipJUzVA,443680,445759,in the dry when your tires are hot
KkFBipJUzVA,445759,448080,basically it's fun without going insane
KkFBipJUzVA,448080,450960,speeds the gr86 is a second quicker from
KkFBipJUzVA,450960,453199,north to 60 than the old gt86 and it
KkFBipJUzVA,453199,455840,will do 140 miles an hour but there's no
KkFBipJUzVA,455840,457919,car you can imagine that's less about
KkFBipJUzVA,457919,459440,the numbers
KkFBipJUzVA,459440,463840,so this new gr86 will do north to 60 and
KkFBipJUzVA,463840,465840,seconds you can have an automatic which
KkFBipJUzVA,465840,467599,is slightly slower but with all that
KkFBipJUzVA,467599,469599,power going to the rear wheels if you
KkFBipJUzVA,469599,472080,are medically able please please go for
KkFBipJUzVA,472080,474319,the manual it's a cracker
KkFBipJUzVA,474319,476080,really nice doesn't feel as notchy as i
KkFBipJUzVA,476080,480240,remember the old gt 86 feeling
KkFBipJUzVA,480240,481360,but there is
KkFBipJUzVA,481360,484560,obviously some familiarity here in
KkFBipJUzVA,484560,487199,similar kind of suspension settings the
KkFBipJUzVA,487199,489840,body is obviously very similar
KkFBipJUzVA,489840,491360,dimensions as well although wherever
KkFBipJUzVA,491360,492720,it's just slightly lower and apparently
KkFBipJUzVA,492720,495680,you sit a bit lower as well but yeah the
KkFBipJUzVA,495680,497840,driving experience feels
KkFBipJUzVA,497840,500080,like the gt did but every little bit has
KkFBipJUzVA,500080,502479,been made a little bit better
KkFBipJUzVA,502479,504560,if you're sick of the hypercar power
KkFBipJUzVA,504560,506879,wars and classic cars with values rising
KkFBipJUzVA,506879,509039,faster than fuel prices this is the
KkFBipJUzVA,509039,510879,machine you've been waiting for it's
KkFBipJUzVA,510879,513120,just a pity it's sold out so fast and
KkFBipJUzVA,513120,514560,it's only going to be on sale for a
KkFBipJUzVA,514560,516640,couple of years in the uk if you're
KkFBipJUzVA,516640,518159,thinking
KkFBipJUzVA,518159,520399,also sounds a bit meaty than it did
KkFBipJUzVA,520399,521760,before there's some interesting stuff
KkFBipJUzVA,521760,523680,going on there that you might not like
KkFBipJUzVA,523680,525839,you see in the gt86 there was a pipe
KkFBipJUzVA,525839,527360,coming off the engine that was just
KkFBipJUzVA,527360,530240,designed to sort of burp engine noise
KkFBipJUzVA,530240,532480,into your face
KkFBipJUzVA,532480,534000,problem is that did make the car quite
KkFBipJUzVA,534000,535600,unrefined on the motorway so what
KkFBipJUzVA,535600,538080,they've done this time is they've piped
KkFBipJUzVA,538080,540320,the engine noise through the speakers
KkFBipJUzVA,540320,541839,now that means you can have more engine
KkFBipJUzVA,541839,544399,noise when you're holding
KkFBipJUzVA,544399,545760,into the red line
KkFBipJUzVA,545760,547120,but when you say cruising on the
KkFBipJUzVA,547120,549279,motorway they can turn it down maybe
KkFBipJUzVA,549279,551839,that's not quite as authentic and purist
KkFBipJUzVA,551839,553839,as the old car was but
KkFBipJUzVA,553839,555279,i don't know
KkFBipJUzVA,555279,557680,sports cars are becoming a bit of a
KkFBipJUzVA,557680,559120,a last chance salute at the moment
KkFBipJUzVA,559120,560880,they're not going to be around forever
KkFBipJUzVA,560880,562959,and especially ones with rear drive
KkFBipJUzVA,562959,565279,manual gearboxes and all the purest
KkFBipJUzVA,565279,569120,stuff that people love to get ever so
KkFBipJUzVA,569120,570399,choked up about
KkFBipJUzVA,570399,571279,so
KkFBipJUzVA,571279,573360,makes a half decent noise
KkFBipJUzVA,573360,574880,doesn't sound that anti-social there's
KkFBipJUzVA,574880,578160,no fake hops and bangs
KkFBipJUzVA,578160,579040,yeah
KkFBipJUzVA,579040,580880,i'm enjoying the noise
KkFBipJUzVA,580880,582320,i'm enjoying all of it to be honest with
KkFBipJUzVA,582320,583279,you
KkFBipJUzVA,583279,584720,since we're on the track i've got the
KkFBipJUzVA,584720,586720,stability control in the track setting
KkFBipJUzVA,586720,588800,so the car's nice and playful and it's
KkFBipJUzVA,588800,591200,super approachable what's nice as well
KkFBipJUzVA,591200,593760,is that i'd never driven the new gr86
KkFBipJUzVA,593760,595600,before this morning i'd also never
KkFBipJUzVA,595600,597920,driven this circuit but i've jumped into
KkFBipJUzVA,597920,600640,it and within a lap and a half
KkFBipJUzVA,600640,602800,you get the traction control off and you
KkFBipJUzVA,602800,605279,just start having a laugh i feel like
KkFBipJUzVA,605279,606720,you could get into this ten minutes
KkFBipJUzVA,606720,608720,after you passed your driving test and
KkFBipJUzVA,608720,610720,you would fundamentally understand what
KkFBipJUzVA,610720,614079,makes sports cars a joy to drive or you
KkFBipJUzVA,614079,615920,could put formula one world champion in
KkFBipJUzVA,615920,617120,here
KkFBipJUzVA,617120,619760,and they would appreciate the natural
KkFBipJUzVA,619760,623040,sense of of balance and how involved you
KkFBipJUzVA,623040,625360,as the driver feel chucking this little
KkFBipJUzVA,625360,627440,sports car around
KkFBipJUzVA,627440,630399,if you want more punch then now go and
KkFBipJUzVA,630399,632079,have a supra because it's now got a
KkFBipJUzVA,632079,634399,manual it now feels a little bit better
KkFBipJUzVA,634399,638000,sorted a bit more tied down but for me
KkFBipJUzVA,638000,640959,at 30 grand this is so
KkFBipJUzVA,640959,643200,much fun and there's no gimmicks there's
KkFBipJUzVA,643200,646320,no drift mode there's no sort of extra
KkFBipJUzVA,646320,649519,settings okay i can have a g meter on my
KkFBipJUzVA,649519,651440,dashboard but that's about it
KkFBipJUzVA,651440,654640,fundamentally what's fun in here is the
KkFBipJUzVA,654640,657200,handling so although i'm supposed to
KkFBipJUzVA,657200,659040,have gone to the pit lane now
KkFBipJUzVA,659040,661040,i'm gonna keep going until they tell me
KkFBipJUzVA,661040,661550,to come in
KkFBipJUzVA,661550,664480,[Music]
KkFBipJUzVA,664480,666079,while it's still got some rubber left on
KkFBipJUzVA,666079,668320,its tyres let's pop out onto the road
KkFBipJUzVA,668320,670720,see if the gr86 can still cut it where
KkFBipJUzVA,670720,672800,it's going to spend most of its life
KkFBipJUzVA,672800,674560,what's great is when you get yourself on
KkFBipJUzVA,674560,677200,a great trip to road like we're on now
KkFBipJUzVA,677200,678880,okay you're not kicking the tail out or
KkFBipJUzVA,678880,680320,trying to smoke the tires at all but
KkFBipJUzVA,680320,682320,there's still just lots to enjoy this is
KkFBipJUzVA,682320,684640,a fun car to pour through a corner it
KkFBipJUzVA,684640,686880,doesn't take up much space on the road
KkFBipJUzVA,686880,689519,so you've got lots of lane to play with
KkFBipJUzVA,689519,692079,the visibility is fantastic this gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,692079,694079,i just find myself changing gear for the
KkFBipJUzVA,694079,696560,hell of it it's not the finest shift
KkFBipJUzVA,696560,699600,i've ever experienced but i'll take it
KkFBipJUzVA,699600,702480,it's a good manual box in a really great
KkFBipJUzVA,702480,705200,chassis what sets really good driver's
KkFBipJUzVA,705200,707920,cars apart for me is when it feels like
KkFBipJUzVA,707920,709440,all of their disparate elements have
KkFBipJUzVA,709440,712079,been set up by people who absolutely
KkFBipJUzVA,712079,714320,agreed on how they should feel so the
KkFBipJUzVA,714320,716880,steering weight the pedal weights the
KkFBipJUzVA,716880,719680,sensation of the shift and just the
KkFBipJUzVA,719680,721519,speed at which the car gives you
KkFBipJUzVA,721519,724000,feedback it all matches in here it's
KkFBipJUzVA,724000,726880,just really cohesive and that makes it
KkFBipJUzVA,726880,728839,enjoyable and it gives you
KkFBipJUzVA,728839,730399,confidence
KkFBipJUzVA,730399,732240,on the road it's where you really notice
KkFBipJUzVA,732240,734240,that extra mid-range torque okay it's
KkFBipJUzVA,734240,737760,only 184 pounds feet this is by no means
KkFBipJUzVA,737760,739920,some sort of you know tug boat that
KkFBipJUzVA,739920,742880,could pull oak trees over but it does
KkFBipJUzVA,742880,745279,the job and you stay on the boil that
KkFBipJUzVA,745279,748079,much easier than in the gt86 where at
KkFBipJUzVA,748079,750720,about 4000 rpm where we are now
KkFBipJUzVA,750720,753120,used to kind of tumble head first into a
KkFBipJUzVA,753120,758440,talk hole here now it keeps pulling
KkFBipJUzVA,758959,761440,could you live with this car i mean it's
KkFBipJUzVA,761440,763600,very uncomplicated that's something you
KkFBipJUzVA,763600,765600,should really focus on about the gr
KkFBipJUzVA,765600,767839,there's not too many modes and different
KkFBipJUzVA,767839,769680,ways of setting it up there's no comfort
KkFBipJUzVA,769680,771360,or rate setting for the suspension
KkFBipJUzVA,771360,774399,there's one setting from the factory and
KkFBipJUzVA,774399,776639,does the job fine
KkFBipJUzVA,776639,778480,okay no one who drops into that seat
KkFBipJUzVA,778480,779760,there is your passenger is going to be
KkFBipJUzVA,779760,781600,wowed by this interior but it is at
KkFBipJUzVA,781600,783680,least well made it's well put together
KkFBipJUzVA,783680,786160,it's practical there's plenty of storage
KkFBipJUzVA,786160,788240,these seats i like to sit a little bit
KkFBipJUzVA,788240,790399,lower maybe but in terms of support
KkFBipJUzVA,790399,792160,around the shoulders around the hips
KkFBipJUzVA,792160,794399,they're fantastic proper sports cars
KkFBipJUzVA,794399,796399,should have proper seats you can check
KkFBipJUzVA,796399,798800,that box for the gr
KkFBipJUzVA,798800,800240,and then it just comes back to the price
KkFBipJUzVA,800240,803920,at 300 quid a month or just under 30
KkFBipJUzVA,803920,805760,grand for the rrp
KkFBipJUzVA,805760,807839,i'm glad that they didn't swave it in
KkFBipJUzVA,807839,809760,leather and big fillets of aluminium and
KkFBipJUzVA,809760,812800,then charged me more money for it
KkFBipJUzVA,812800,814639,just wish i'd got a deposit down in time
KkFBipJUzVA,814639,816399,really the fact that this thing is sold
KkFBipJUzVA,816399,817279,out
KkFBipJUzVA,817279,819199,proves that toronto is on to a winner
KkFBipJUzVA,819199,821760,with how it priced and pitched this car
KkFBipJUzVA,821760,823920,and if you are getting one
KkFBipJUzVA,823920,825600,i think you're really really gonna like
KkFBipJUzVA,825600,827040,it
KkFBipJUzVA,827040,828480,i said i was really looking forward to
KkFBipJUzVA,828480,831440,driving the gr86 and after the track and
KkFBipJUzVA,831440,833760,the road it absolutely hasn't let me
KkFBipJUzVA,833760,835279,down
KkFBipJUzVA,835279,837600,it's not been a terrible day driving
KkFBipJUzVA,837600,839360,toyotas there are many years when you
KkFBipJUzVA,839360,840959,couldn't say that so what do we think
KkFBipJUzVA,840959,843360,well the supra i love the manual gearbox
KkFBipJUzVA,843360,845519,and i am heartened by the fact toyota is
KkFBipJUzVA,845519,847199,determined to improve
KkFBipJUzVA,847199,850079,its flagship sports car but for 20 grand
KkFBipJUzVA,850079,853279,less the gr86 wow it's not just the best
KkFBipJUzVA,853279,855279,sports car that toyota makes it's a
KkFBipJUzVA,855279,857360,great way for the petrol engine sports
KkFBipJUzVA,857360,861480,car to go out on a hike
