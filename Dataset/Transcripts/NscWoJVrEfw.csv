NscWoJVrEfw,22080,27279,wii sports is the best selling single  platform video game of all time
NscWoJVrEfw,27279,35120,chances are you've played it before  and if you have you probably think it  doesn't lend itself well to speedrunning
NscWoJVrEfw,35120,40719,most games have a clear objective go  from start to finish as fast as possible
NscWoJVrEfw,40719,46079,how do you do that in wii sports  i made a video about wii sports resort
NscWoJVrEfw,46079,54480,golf a while back  imagine the precision and skill involved  with speed golf multiplied by 5 sports
NscWoJVrEfw,54480,61199,here's the story of the gamers who've  done it  this  is the history of wii sports world
NscWoJVrEfw,61199,64199,records
NscWoJVrEfw,66540,88080,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,88080,95040,the biggest speed run category in wii  sports is called all sports  it involves winning a game in each of
NscWoJVrEfw,95040,102720,the five sports consecutively  that means winning a game of tennis  winning a game of baseball completing 10
NscWoJVrEfw,102720,108320,frames of bowling  playing three holes of golf and beating  a boxer
NscWoJVrEfw,108320,115040,you have to play them in order and since  there's no other option  you have to use motion controls
NscWoJVrEfw,115040,120560,now wii sports came out in 2006  but serious runs didn't get started
NscWoJVrEfw,120560,127119,until close to a decade later  in 2014 and 2015 runs clocking in
NscWoJVrEfw,127119,134640,between 10 and 12 minutes were completed  by plyd 823  rsr and nate 9000
NscWoJVrEfw,134640,139840,but as is so often the case  videos either no longer exist or are in
NscWoJVrEfw,139840,147840,very poor quality so we have to go to  july 2015 to get our first watchable run
NscWoJVrEfw,147840,153200,a 945  by the mid-2000s internet culture named
NscWoJVrEfw,153200,158720,nate 9000  there were five sports for nate to get
NscWoJVrEfw,158720,165519,through  the first one was actually the simplest  tennis  your opponents are picked based on your
NscWoJVrEfw,165519,171519,skill level  at level zero you'll get miu and matt  who barely know what they're doing out
NscWoJVrEfw,171519,177599,there  you have to get four points to win so  nate tried to just end each rally as
NscWoJVrEfw,177599,183840,quickly as possible  by serving at the very top of your throw  you'll hit the ball harder and make it
NscWoJVrEfw,183840,189200,tougher for the opponent to return it  this has about a five frame window or a
NscWoJVrEfw,189200,195360,sixth of a second  so nate did that four times and hoped  his opponent would miss it which is
NscWoJVrEfw,195360,200800,random if they returned it he just hit  it across the court to quickly end the  rally
NscWoJVrEfw,200800,206000,it took him only 25 seconds to win the  game and exit back to the menu
NscWoJVrEfw,206000,213200,and that's pretty much all there is to  tennis in wii sports speedrunning  you can lose a bit of time from returns
NscWoJVrEfw,213200,220319,but even those only cost a couple of  seconds  however the next sport is way way more
NscWoJVrEfw,220319,225760,involved than the simple rallies of  tennis  it was time for nate to play some
NscWoJVrEfw,225760,232799,baseball  [Music]  the most important thing to know here is
NscWoJVrEfw,232799,241200,that if a team's ever up by five or more  runs after an inning the game ends right  there from the mercy rule so the idea is
NscWoJVrEfw,241200,247840,that you want to get five runs as fast  as possible in the top half of the  inning then get three outs in the bottom
NscWoJVrEfw,247840,253920,half and have the game end after just  one inning  hopefully rob manfred's not getting any
NscWoJVrEfw,253920,259120,ideas  however  getting an optimal inning of baseball is
NscWoJVrEfw,259120,264960,way easier said than done  when batting there was no real strategy
NscWoJVrEfw,264960,271120,just swing at good pitches and pray you  get hits  nate reached on an error then lined one
NscWoJVrEfw,271120,276320,to left for a base hit  from there he was off to the races
NscWoJVrEfw,276320,282479,a double in the gap then a bloop to  right  some bad luck for akira on the mound
NscWoJVrEfw,282479,287840,but there was nothing lucky about the 3  run shot immediately after
NscWoJVrEfw,287840,294320,that made it 5 runs for nate but he  still needed to get out twice more to  end the inning
NscWoJVrEfw,294320,299680,so he just struck out twice on purpose  on fastballs that make barry zito look
NscWoJVrEfw,299680,305440,like bruzdar graderol in comparison  for pitching you obviously want to get
NscWoJVrEfw,305440,311039,three outs without giving up any hits or  runs  but there's a lot more to it than that
NscWoJVrEfw,311039,316960,what you ultimately want to do is turn  into mark burley  there's a foolish youtuber who has a
NscWoJVrEfw,316960,323440,video if you want to know more about him  but essentially what it means is you  want to induce weak contact for easy
NscWoJVrEfw,323440,329039,outs and not strike people out  strikeouts always take at least three
NscWoJVrEfw,329039,334400,pitches  while a ball in play for an out could be  done in just one pitch
NscWoJVrEfw,334400,341039,the problem of course  is you have little to no control as to  whether the batter will swing or not
NscWoJVrEfw,341039,348320,so you have to make pitches that are  good enough to not get barreled but not  so good that they just swing and miss
NscWoJVrEfw,348320,353520,and of course get super lucky  nate wasn't so fortunate
NscWoJVrEfw,353520,360720,his first batter stared at three  straight strikes and his second one  well hid it there
NscWoJVrEfw,360720,367039,his third batter struck out on an aethus  before he finally got out of the inning  on a ground out
NscWoJVrEfw,367039,373840,not the ideal baseball split but there  were still three sports to go  next up was bowling
NscWoJVrEfw,373840,379600,the strategy here was a bit more  straightforward  the more strikes you throw the better
NscWoJVrEfw,379600,386400,since strikes only involve throwing the  ball once per frame instead of twice  there exists setups to get a strike
NscWoJVrEfw,386400,391680,nearly every time but they're all pretty  slow so nate just threw it as fast as he
NscWoJVrEfw,391680,397360,could  he only managed two strikes before  intentionally missing on frame 10 to
NscWoJVrEfw,397360,404560,avoid the third throw  however his shots were all fast enough  that it was still a decent split
NscWoJVrEfw,404560,411360,now it was time for sport number four  golf  there are nine holes playable in wii
NscWoJVrEfw,411360,416479,sports but to count for an all sports  run all you needed to do was the three
NscWoJVrEfw,416479,423520,in beginner mode or either of the other  three hole options  and then it was time to play some speed
NscWoJVrEfw,423520,432089,golf  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,434160,440240,you line up for each shot as quickly as  you can go  then hit it and hope for the best
NscWoJVrEfw,440240,446960,there's not much time to think  you just line up and go  there's one key difference between golf
NscWoJVrEfw,446960,453039,in wii sports and wii sports resort in  resort if you hit an incredible shot
NscWoJVrEfw,453039,460400,one that either lands near or in the  hole from a long distance away  you'll get a replay that loses time
NscWoJVrEfw,460400,467120,however that mechanic is not present in  the original wii sports  so anything is game
NscWoJVrEfw,467120,472800,the better shots you can make the more  time you'll save  nate tried to take advantage of this on
NscWoJVrEfw,472800,478720,hole 1 but his second shot landed over  the hole  his first putt was wide left so he had
NscWoJVrEfw,478720,485440,to take a par  hole two was much of the same with his  initial shot going beyond the hole then
NscWoJVrEfw,485440,490879,needing two more shots to get it in  and on hole three despite the crowd
NscWoJVrEfw,490879,495919,getting excited  nate once again was unable to get under
NscWoJVrEfw,495919,502240,par  that made it three pars on three holes  from nate which doesn't sound great but
NscWoJVrEfw,502240,508720,keep in mind he was against the constant  pressure of needing to aim each shot as  quickly as possible
NscWoJVrEfw,508720,514320,and finally the last sport is boxing  you want to ensure your mii is ranked
NscWoJVrEfw,514320,519518,low to get an easy opponent like marco  then just go ham on him until they're
NscWoJVrEfw,519518,524880,down and hope they stay down  if you punch in a rhythm aiming for a
NscWoJVrEfw,524880,531279,nice 15 frame window on each punch  you'll be landing critical hits that do  more damage
NscWoJVrEfw,531279,537440,if all goes well you'll be able to avoid  getting punched at all and knock your  opponent down quickly
NscWoJVrEfw,537440,544320,hopefully they'll stay down and won't  get up  it's not known exactly what causes them  to stay down but it seems to be a
NscWoJVrEfw,544320,550080,combination of knocking them down  quickly not getting hit yourself  and some luck
NscWoJVrEfw,550080,556080,and that's exactly what happened to nate  this was the first ever sub 10 minute
NscWoJVrEfw,556080,563040,run of wii sports  there were some highlights like a very  smooth boxing match and the fast start
NscWoJVrEfw,563040,570080,he had to baseball  but of course the large number of  strikeouts and overall slow bowling and
NscWoJVrEfw,570080,577279,golf sections meant there was some big  room for improvement  nate knew this and just two weeks later
NscWoJVrEfw,577279,582880,he lowered it another 19 seconds  his golfing was particularly improved in
NscWoJVrEfw,582880,588560,this run  getting three birdies instead of three  pars and not missing putts
NscWoJVrEfw,588560,595360,which made up most of the time save  so  926 was the new time to beat
NscWoJVrEfw,595360,601920,and it would stand  for over two years  it wasn't a particularly optimized
NscWoJVrEfw,601920,608399,record or anything  it was just one of those dry spells that  speed games sometimes go through
NscWoJVrEfw,608399,614000,but in june 2017  the wii series discord server was  created
NscWoJVrEfw,614000,621200,which helped spark more popularity in  running the game  in august a player named mr jimmy steele
NscWoJVrEfw,621200,626800,25 joined and within hours  said he had beaten nate's record with a
NscWoJVrEfw,626800,632800,9 16.  we'll get to this run in a moment  but there's something else important to
NscWoJVrEfw,632800,639320,discuss  when jimmy started up his game of  baseball  this cutscene played first
NscWoJVrEfw,639320,642609,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,645360,652959,now most of you who have played wii  sports before are probably familiar with  it  but i guarantee there's a small subset
NscWoJVrEfw,652959,660079,of you who  despite having played the game before  have never seen this cutscene and
NscWoJVrEfw,660079,667279,there's a reason for that  see when wii sports was released in 2006
NscWoJVrEfw,667279,673519,it was bundled with every wii console  sold  europe japan and most other regions of
NscWoJVrEfw,673519,680560,the world had the same version of the  game  however  for a few months after its release
NscWoJVrEfw,680560,686720,the version of wii sports that was sold  in north america  was actually an early version of the
NscWoJVrEfw,686720,693360,game  the community calls it 1.00  and it emits certain features present in
NscWoJVrEfw,693360,700959,1.01  the version sold everywhere else in the  world  the two most important features are both
NscWoJVrEfw,700959,707519,in baseball  first the cut scene you just saw  which wastes about five seconds and
NscWoJVrEfw,707519,715120,can't be skipped  isn't present in 1.00  and second whenever someone grounds out
NscWoJVrEfw,715120,722639,an animation plays in 1.01 of them  throwing the first  which wastes about 0.7 seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,722639,729360,this animation doesn't play in 1.00  that means that for a typical all sports
NscWoJVrEfw,729360,734720,run playing on the early version of the  game is hugely advantageous
NscWoJVrEfw,734720,742160,as it'll save you close to 10 seconds  over playing on 1.01  now when wii sports was re-released in
NscWoJVrEfw,742160,747279,north america in july 2007 to promote  the new remote jacket
NscWoJVrEfw,747279,753760,they updated it to 1.01 to match the  rest of the world  the cut scene and the animations were
NscWoJVrEfw,753760,761519,added back in  so  this optimal speedrun version of the  game can only be found on north american
NscWoJVrEfw,761519,768800,copies made within the first 9 months of  its release  any copy from the next 10 years is of
NscWoJVrEfw,768800,775440,the slower updated version  that means that even though wii sports  is one of the best selling games of all
NscWoJVrEfw,775440,782000,time  this early version is quite rare  it's estimated that only about 1 in
NscWoJVrEfw,782000,789360,every 20 copies of the game is 1.00  or 1 in every 10 north american copies
NscWoJVrEfw,789360,795279,there's an easy way to check if your  copy is 1.00  if it's a north american copy and the
NscWoJVrEfw,795279,803200,title screen says 2006  then it's 1.00  if it says 2006-2007
NscWoJVrEfw,803200,808320,and the wii remote has a jacket on it  then it's not the early version
NscWoJVrEfw,808320,813839,since jimmy was playing on 1.01 he lost  some pretty significant time in baseball
NscWoJVrEfw,813839,820079,from version differences alone  however he had a smart strategy to use  while batting
NscWoJVrEfw,820079,825440,once he got his 5 runs instead of  striking out on purpose he bunted for a
NscWoJVrEfw,825440,831519,quick ground out  this took far fewer pitches than  strikeouts but it's tough to perfectly
NscWoJVrEfw,831519,840000,angle your bat to bunt the ball where  you want it to go  on the pitching side  jimmy was nearly perfect a strike then a
NscWoJVrEfw,840000,845120,ground out to short a ground out to  first then a soft comebacker
NscWoJVrEfw,845120,851839,a four pitch inning  the rest of his run was up and down  getting two strikes and bowling and a
NscWoJVrEfw,851839,858000,birdie in golf  next up was nikro who set a 9 15 just
NscWoJVrEfw,858000,865760,days after jimmy's 9 16.  he has a pretty big internet presence  nowadays but back then he had just a few
NscWoJVrEfw,865760,872720,hundred followers  now nikro's world record run was solid  and all particularly in golf where he
NscWoJVrEfw,872720,877839,got all three birdies  however the highlight of the run was his
NscWoJVrEfw,877839,885199,batting  he had one run in  but two outs  he still needed four more runs
NscWoJVrEfw,885199,891040,and with a ground ball hit at the second  baseman  it wasn't looking good
NscWoJVrEfw,891040,898880,but then  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,898880,907839,uh  drop that yes  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,907839,914079,oh my god  three errors  the odds in that happening were one in a
NscWoJVrEfw,914079,921839,thousand  nikros 915 would stand for a few months  before being beaten by alaska xp2 in
NscWoJVrEfw,921839,926959,january 2018.  alaska had an interesting skill set
NscWoJVrEfw,926959,932639,he was particularly good at bowling and  golf  in bowling he managed to hit seven
NscWoJVrEfw,932639,939440,strikes without carefully lining up  and in golf he had more experience than  most thanks to his golf runs in wii
NscWoJVrEfw,939440,946720,sports and wii sports resort  he managed birdies on holes one and two  and thanks to a beautiful second shot on
NscWoJVrEfw,946720,952880,hole three he got an eagle there  however alaska struggled mightily with
NscWoJVrEfw,952880,961759,boxing losing 9 seconds from mistimed  critical hits  still it was good enough for a 904
NscWoJVrEfw,961759,966839,six months later nikra would come back  to snag another record
NscWoJVrEfw,966839,974000,901 once again it was an up and down run  his baseball was quite fast with five
NscWoJVrEfw,974000,981199,quick runs while batting and no base  runners while pitching  however his one strike in bowling paled
NscWoJVrEfw,981199,987040,in comparison  and let's just say his golf hole 1  wasn't ideal
NscWoJVrEfw,987040,993199,the run had good moments and it had bad  moments  we've seen a handful of records at this
NscWoJVrEfw,993199,998320,point and you can probably tell that  this up and down nature was typical for
NscWoJVrEfw,998320,1004160,wii sports  outside of tennis  any of the other four sports can cause
NscWoJVrEfw,1004160,1010399,massive time swings  in baseball you've got to deal with  batting and pitching
NscWoJVrEfw,1010399,1015920,both are extremely random and can  literally cause minutes of time loss
NscWoJVrEfw,1015920,1021680,with bowling a good game versus a bad  one costs up to 30 seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,1021680,1027760,in golf each missed shot can cost 10  seconds and across 3 holes that really
NscWoJVrEfw,1027760,1034480,adds up  and in boxing missing critical hits can  lose a dozen seconds or more
NscWoJVrEfw,1034480,1042400,this game wasn't like your traditional  speed run where you can optimize it and  eventually grind down every split
NscWoJVrEfw,1042400,1048640,no the time swings in wii sports were  different  they were more random and far harder to
NscWoJVrEfw,1048640,1054720,control  the record was 901 and with everything  listed before going in the right
NscWoJVrEfw,1054720,1061120,direction it could potentially go way  lower  into the eighths or further
NscWoJVrEfw,1061120,1068240,but the odds in having all those time  swings go your way  it just wasn't realistic
NscWoJVrEfw,1068240,1073679,well  unless alaska had anything to say about  it
NscWoJVrEfw,1078960,1084559,in the second half of 2018 alaska would  embark on a push to take the all sports
NscWoJVrEfw,1084559,1089840,record into the 8 minute range and  beyond  he certainly had the credentials to get
NscWoJVrEfw,1089840,1097039,it there  but the issues of before still remained  getting all 5 sports to line up properly
NscWoJVrEfw,1097039,1103280,was just too difficult  he was going to need some help  and over the next few months
NscWoJVrEfw,1103280,1108880,that's exactly what he got  one new strategy he used was expanding
NscWoJVrEfw,1108880,1116000,the scope of bunting  players had been bunting for a quick out  for months but if you very carefully
NscWoJVrEfw,1116000,1122720,angle your wii remote slightly more  forward you could potentially bunt for  singles as well
NscWoJVrEfw,1122720,1127840,the margin between bunting for a hit and  bunting fern out was razor thin
NscWoJVrEfw,1127840,1133520,but with a lot of practice you can  fairly reliably bunt it to third for a  hit
NscWoJVrEfw,1133520,1140160,so now  alaska could theoretically bunt four  times to load the bases and score a run
NscWoJVrEfw,1140160,1145360,then hit a grand slam  then bunt three more times for outs
NscWoJVrEfw,1145360,1151520,it could still go wrong  but there was potential for a really  fast batting split
NscWoJVrEfw,1151520,1158799,now for bowling  the days of games with just two or three  strikes had to be in the past
NscWoJVrEfw,1158799,1164080,alaska is going to shoot for more like  six or seven strikes in a good game the
NscWoJVrEfw,1164080,1169520,record at the time  nikros 901 had only one strike
NscWoJVrEfw,1169520,1174960,alaska could easily save 20 seconds over  that  he was already quite good at bowling
NscWoJVrEfw,1174960,1180240,strikes but with more experience he  could save the time more reliably
NscWoJVrEfw,1180240,1186720,in golf alaska began using an impressive  looking strategy to save a few seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,1186720,1192160,the driver chip  [Music]  similar to a trick used in wii sports
NscWoJVrEfw,1192160,1198000,resort  the flag on the green acts as a wall if  your golf ball hits it
NscWoJVrEfw,1198000,1204720,if you're able to use a driver and hit  your ball into it it can fall straight  down and enter the hole
NscWoJVrEfw,1204720,1212080,saving time over having to slowly put it  in or get it closer to the hole  now the driver chip may seem super
NscWoJVrEfw,1212080,1218400,precise  but there's actually a setup on hole 2  to get it nearly every time
NscWoJVrEfw,1218400,1225039,by hitting your first shot into the  bunker you can then line up with the  flag and pull out your driver
NscWoJVrEfw,1225039,1231200,by swinging as hard as you can  the game will automatically hook the  ball to the right at just the correct
NscWoJVrEfw,1231200,1236880,angle and speed to hit the flag and  finally there was boxing
NscWoJVrEfw,1236880,1242960,this was the sport that alaska struggled  with the most  there wasn't any particular new strategy
NscWoJVrEfw,1242960,1249840,he had to use here  he just had to improve at it  get better at timing the criticals avoid
NscWoJVrEfw,1249840,1256159,getting punched himself and ensure that  his opponent had no real chance of  getting up
NscWoJVrEfw,1256159,1262720,over time he did get better  but it was still a battle  with all this
NscWoJVrEfw,1262720,1269919,a sub 9 minute run was definitely  possible  but was a sub 8 realistic 2
NscWoJVrEfw,1269919,1277440,it would take a miracle run  but it could be done  alaska quickly began seeing results
NscWoJVrEfw,1277440,1284400,he got an 843 on july 22nd  and then in 8 30 on august 15th
NscWoJVrEfw,1284400,1291679,his bowling and pitching were great but  his batting was far from perfect and he  missed a putt on hole one
NscWoJVrEfw,1291679,1298710,there was still a long way to go  and then came september 29th
NscWoJVrEfw,1298710,1304890,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1305660,1312340,[Applause]  [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1312340,1318400,[Applause]  [Music]  yes come on
NscWoJVrEfw,1318400,1323679,three  four  five  six  seven
NscWoJVrEfw,1323679,1329200,eight  nine  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1330159,1335280,five  [Applause]  will that work
NscWoJVrEfw,1335280,1340799,two  three  four  five  six
NscWoJVrEfw,1340799,1346240,seven  eight  nine  ten
NscWoJVrEfw,1347650,1352880,[Music]  after all that
NscWoJVrEfw,1352880,1361039,still a record by four seconds  what happened  well it was the god run up until boxing
NscWoJVrEfw,1361039,1367120,his batting was near perfect with four  bunt singles a grand slam and three bunt
NscWoJVrEfw,1367120,1372559,outs  his pitching was solid with two  strikeouts and a one pitch out
NscWoJVrEfw,1372559,1378640,he hit four strikes while bowling and in  golf got a birdie a driver chip birdie
NscWoJVrEfw,1378640,1385360,and an eagle  it was sub 8 pace  but he just couldn't hit criticals which
NscWoJVrEfw,1385360,1391760,led to a slow knockdown and his opponent  getting up  but alaska wasn't done yet
NscWoJVrEfw,1391760,1396799,there wasn't much room to improve early  on  but he had about half a minute he could
NscWoJVrEfw,1396799,1402400,save on boxing alone  this sub 8 grind had to continue
NscWoJVrEfw,1402400,1408520,he had come close once  he just had to do it again
NscWoJVrEfw,1408520,1416409,[Music]  [Applause]  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1416880,1423559,let's go  [Music]  oh my god
NscWoJVrEfw,1424060,1432000,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1432000,1438980,yes  [Music]  let's go
NscWoJVrEfw,1438980,1454159,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1454159,1460960,oh my god please  dude  don't [ __ ] get up don't you [ __ ]
NscWoJVrEfw,1460960,1466720,dare  oh my god  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1466720,1472799,yes  oh my god  oh my god i've done it
NscWoJVrEfw,1472799,1479679,i've [ __ ] done it  oh my god dude  a legendary run
NscWoJVrEfw,1479679,1486799,alaska's sub 8 dream had finally come  true  it was beautiful from start to finish
NscWoJVrEfw,1486799,1493600,a six pitch inning while pitching  six strikes in bowling  three birdies in golf
NscWoJVrEfw,1493600,1500960,and finally a boxing where his opponent  stayed down  it all added up to a 754
NscWoJVrEfw,1500960,1507760,the first sub 8 in the history of wii  sports  this run firmly cemented alaska at the
NscWoJVrEfw,1507760,1513600,top  nobody was really close to him  second place was more than 30 seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,1513600,1518960,behind  and 754 continued to stay on top
NscWoJVrEfw,1518960,1525679,people got a little closer but there  wasn't much new to use  they had to replicate what alaska did
NscWoJVrEfw,1525679,1530720,and find somewhere to save time  after 18 months of this
NscWoJVrEfw,1530720,1536080,it was clear  there was only one person up to the task  competing alaska
NscWoJVrEfw,1536080,1541000,and that person  was alaska
NscWoJVrEfw,1544400,1549760,come on  let's go  in may 2020
NscWoJVrEfw,1549760,1556159,alaska beat his own record by eight  seconds  most of the time save came while batting
NscWoJVrEfw,1556159,1563120,he avoided a missed bunt that he had in  his old record  other than that it was nearly identical
NscWoJVrEfw,1563120,1570240,a six pitch inning six strikes and three  birdies  he had found a way to just eke out the
NscWoJVrEfw,1570240,1575360,time he needed  many more months passed and his 746
NscWoJVrEfw,1575360,1582320,remained alone at the top  at this point he had held the record for  about two and a half years
NscWoJVrEfw,1582320,1588480,that's significant for a popular game  like wii sports  but by early 2021
NscWoJVrEfw,1588480,1593840,he finally had some close competition  two players had achieved sub eights of
NscWoJVrEfw,1593840,1601039,their own  one was sphere cube and the other was  paul in the mall
NscWoJVrEfw,1601039,1607200,spherecube's personal best was 748 just  two seconds behind alaska
NscWoJVrEfw,1607200,1613760,but on february 16th  he had a run within striking distance of  the record going into golf
NscWoJVrEfw,1613760,1620999,and on hole 1  he did this  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1624559,1629679,it saved about six seconds  hole two had a driver chip and he
NscWoJVrEfw,1629679,1636240,finished on hole three with an eagle  in all he saved 15 seconds over alaska
NscWoJVrEfw,1636240,1642000,on golf alone  it was enough to edge him out with a 743
NscWoJVrEfw,1642000,1647919,making it the first time someone had  dethroned alaska in nearly three years
NscWoJVrEfw,1647919,1654320,and the best part about it  he did it while playing on 1.01
NscWoJVrEfw,1654320,1660000,i mentioned before how much rarer 1.00  is  and despite being a top runner of the
NscWoJVrEfw,1660000,1666640,game  spherecube was unable to acquire a copy  of it  he lost about 10 seconds in baseball
NscWoJVrEfw,1666640,1673039,from that and still was able to beat  alaska  he was pretty good
NscWoJVrEfw,1673039,1680640,about a month later  paul in the mall was making strides for  the record  he got a sub 8 but took a break from
NscWoJVrEfw,1680640,1686720,running the game around the time sphere  cube got the record  he came back a month and a half later
NscWoJVrEfw,1686720,1694880,and got a 7 37 a record by six seconds  paul played on 1.00 so he saved quite a
NscWoJVrEfw,1694880,1699919,bit of time in baseball over sphere cube  but immediately after this record was
NscWoJVrEfw,1699919,1704559,set  controversy arose
NscWoJVrEfw,1705279,1710480,once you finish hole 3 of golf the  fastest way to move on to boxing is to
NscWoJVrEfw,1710480,1717520,reset to the menu  for years the rule was that once the  golf ball hit the bottom of the hole you
NscWoJVrEfw,1717520,1722640,could perform the reset  however  in july 2020
NscWoJVrEfw,1722640,1728720,runner emoad nomad hit this unbelievable  shot
NscWoJVrEfw,1729360,1734480,the ball hit the bottom so he resets in  the menu  however
NscWoJVrEfw,1734480,1740880,you can see that when he reset the ball  was in the process of bouncing back up
NscWoJVrEfw,1740880,1746320,on chip ins like this  it's actually possible that the ball  hits the bottom
NscWoJVrEfw,1746320,1752559,bounces up and lands outside the hole  meaning you need another shot so the
NscWoJVrEfw,1752559,1759600,community came up with a rule that  whenever there was a chip in you have to  wait until the phrase chip in appears on
NscWoJVrEfw,1759600,1768559,the screen to reset  it seemed like a logical rule  however in paul's 737 his whole three
NscWoJVrEfw,1768559,1774880,ended like this  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1774880,1780559,he reset right away but since the ball  hit off the pole it technically would
NscWoJVrEfw,1780559,1786480,have been a chippen and he didn't wait  for the text to appear  but then again
NscWoJVrEfw,1786480,1792720,there wasn't any chance this ball would  have bounced out  it rolled in rather than falling in off
NscWoJVrEfw,1792720,1799520,the polar flag despite technically being  a chip in  the community was split on how to rule
NscWoJVrEfw,1799520,1804559,this run  but ultimately it was allowed to stay on  the leaderboard
NscWoJVrEfw,1804559,1810960,the rule was changed so that as long as  the ball rolled in the hole  even if it was a chip in you could reset
NscWoJVrEfw,1810960,1818480,once it hit the bottom  and so  paul 737 was the official world record
NscWoJVrEfw,1818480,1824240,just like the dozens of records that  came before it the 737 was great
NscWoJVrEfw,1824240,1830320,but in a matter of days it was going to  be obsolete  because this story is going to take a
NscWoJVrEfw,1830320,1838640,bit of a turn  every so often a speed game gets a new  strategy that transforms the run
NscWoJVrEfw,1838640,1844399,there's canonless setup in mario 64.  the scroll glitch in castlevania
NscWoJVrEfw,1844399,1850399,the flagpole glitch setup in super mario  bros  when you think of those speed runs those
NscWoJVrEfw,1850399,1857039,tricks seem intertwined with them  up to this point  wii sports didn't really have a trick
NscWoJVrEfw,1857039,1864640,like that  there were unique strategies to use but  no mind-blowing iconic tricks
NscWoJVrEfw,1864640,1870399,well  that was about to change  because in early 2021
NscWoJVrEfw,1870399,1876399,wii sports game defining trick was going  to be discovered  welcome
NscWoJVrEfw,1876399,1882799,to the wonderful world  of disconnect strats  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,1882799,1889440,this bizarre looking trick has a  treasured past  for years players had noticed an odd
NscWoJVrEfw,1889440,1897679,glitch that sometimes occurred  if your remote disconnected engulf  you could sometimes hit the ball twice
NscWoJVrEfw,1897679,1904480,but you couldn't hit it far and it  couldn't be easily replicated so nobody  was too interested in it
NscWoJVrEfw,1904480,1910799,from 2018 to 2020 this glitch happened  to several players including simple
NscWoJVrEfw,1910799,1918480,strat 17 and even world record holder  alaska xp2  but it remained just a curiosity
NscWoJVrEfw,1918480,1926880,in early 2021  plyde decided to investigate it a bit  more to figure out exactly how it worked
NscWoJVrEfw,1926880,1932080,and what he found  shocked the community  if you hit the ball
NscWoJVrEfw,1932080,1938880,then disconnect your remote by taking  the batteries out you can put the  batteries back in and swing a second
NscWoJVrEfw,1938880,1944559,time  the catch is that the sum of these two  shots can't add up to more than four
NscWoJVrEfw,1944559,1952080,bars of hit power so you can't hit it  further than a normal swing  however if your second shot happens
NscWoJVrEfw,1952080,1957120,after hitting water the ball will stop  on a dime after a quick transition and
NscWoJVrEfw,1957120,1962880,you'll be placed wherever it is  including potentially on top of the  water
NscWoJVrEfw,1962880,1968559,this saves time in a couple of ways  on a hole like hole 5 you're supposed to
NscWoJVrEfw,1968559,1973760,take a curved path around to the green  but with disconnect strats you can go
NscWoJVrEfw,1973760,1981120,straight to the hole across the water  and take a more direct path  and second your ball completely stops
NscWoJVrEfw,1981120,1987919,once the transition occurs  so if your timing is good you can hit  the ball into the water quickly hit it a
NscWoJVrEfw,1987919,1994559,second time and avoid the time the ball  would normally take to stop rolling from  even just one shot
NscWoJVrEfw,1994559,2000960,the river p  wipeout jack and nomad found fast routes  for the intermediate holes so that was
NscWoJVrEfw,2000960,2008080,the new course to use  on hole 5 you can save about 7 seconds  by going straight across the water and
NscWoJVrEfw,2008080,2014480,on hole 6 you can save about 4 from  using the transition to stop right where  you want
NscWoJVrEfw,2014480,2021519,that meant that in theory  11 seconds could be saved  wii sports run suddenly had potential to
NscWoJVrEfw,2021519,2028240,get quite a bit lower  as not only could extra time be saved  but golf could be more consistent as
NscWoJVrEfw,2028240,2035360,well  the first player to use disconnect  strats in a record was shockwave tls who
NscWoJVrEfw,2035360,2041679,lowered the time down to 735  as you'd expect he gained time on golf
NscWoJVrEfw,2041679,2049118,despite his initial disconnect shot on  hole 5 being mistimed  it helped when he hit this shot on hole
NscWoJVrEfw,2049118,2054499,4.  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,2057379,2062398,[Applause]  however
NscWoJVrEfw,2062398,2068079,shockwave is from the uk and he wasn't  able to import a copy of 1.00 from
NscWoJVrEfw,2068079,2074480,overseas so he lost time in baseball  next up was sphere spherecube again
NscWoJVrEfw,2074480,2082079,who lowered the record 9 days later with  a 732  he had switched to 1.00 so he saved the
NscWoJVrEfw,2082079,2087520,time in baseball  but he didn't use disconnect strats
NscWoJVrEfw,2087520,2092560,yeah especially in the early days of  disconnect strats even some top level
NscWoJVrEfw,2092560,2098560,runners found it too difficult to go for  since it wasn't technically needed for  the record
NscWoJVrEfw,2098560,2107359,about a month later  shockwave took it a couple seconds lower  but still he was playing on 1.01
NscWoJVrEfw,2107359,2114880,a few months after that spherecube took  it back  while still not using disconnect strats
NscWoJVrEfw,2114880,2120960,nobody was willing to string it all  together  but in the summer of 2021
NscWoJVrEfw,2120960,2127920,shockwave would finally get a copy of  1.00  a top runner now had all three pieces of
NscWoJVrEfw,2127920,2133440,the puzzle  1.00  a willingness to do disconnect strats
NscWoJVrEfw,2133440,2138560,and a lot of skill  they all combined for a 728
NscWoJVrEfw,2138560,2145920,a new record just one day after sphere  cube 7 30.  this world record really had a lot going
NscWoJVrEfw,2145920,2152320,into it  you've got bunting for outs  bunting for hits  aiming for strikes
NscWoJVrEfw,2152320,2157760,driver chips disconnect strats and much  more
NscWoJVrEfw,2157760,2163119,implemented all of them  and the end result was a 728
NscWoJVrEfw,2163119,2168880,was there any time save left  well there were seconds here and there
NscWoJVrEfw,2168880,2174480,his batting was near perfect but while  pitching  he accidentally threw an immaculate
NscWoJVrEfw,2174480,2179920,inning  three strikeouts which we know from  before are slow
NscWoJVrEfw,2179920,2185520,there was room to save about 15 seconds  there  his bowling was perfect
NscWoJVrEfw,2185520,2192480,9 strikes so no time to save there  for golf he missed the putt on hole 6
NscWoJVrEfw,2192480,2200480,and his boxing could have been a bit  better too  so  sub 7 was definitely possible but the
NscWoJVrEfw,2200480,2205920,problems of before still remained  it required perfection from all five
NscWoJVrEfw,2205920,2213680,sports  and that just wasn't realistic  but that didn't mean people couldn't try
NscWoJVrEfw,2213680,2219440,by september another contender showed up  to play  emo ad nomad
NscWoJVrEfw,2219440,2225599,and over the next few months these guys  were going to engage in a battle  both against each other
NscWoJVrEfw,2225599,2232560,and against the sub 7 barrier  shockwave would strike first with a
NscWoJVrEfw,2232560,2238160,massive seven second cut of the record  he had time to save on pitching and on
NscWoJVrEfw,2238160,2243680,hole six so he gained 12 collective  seconds there but lost a few seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,2243680,2248960,while batting thanks to a foul ball  a few weeks later he'd take it down to
NscWoJVrEfw,2248960,2254480,718 and nomad was right behind him with  the 721
NscWoJVrEfw,2254480,2259599,nomad would then have a run a few  seconds ahead of the record but needed a
NscWoJVrEfw,2259599,2264320,miracle shot on hole 4 to keep it going
NscWoJVrEfw,2265119,2272160,back to the drawing board  on october 11th  shockwave got a 7-16
NscWoJVrEfw,2272160,2279680,nomad followed up shortly after with the  7-17  a run that came just 24 hours too late
NscWoJVrEfw,2279680,2285200,to be a record  on the 15th  shockwave had a run that lost time early
NscWoJVrEfw,2285200,2290400,to batting but had an extraordinarily  fast 5 pitch inning to bring it back to
NscWoJVrEfw,2290400,2296079,even  that showed how much potential there  still was to squeeze out of the record
NscWoJVrEfw,2296079,2301440,it finished as a world record of 7 15  but could have been several seconds
NscWoJVrEfw,2301440,2309040,lower had he not been forced to foul off  an inside pitch  okay so one thing was starting to become
NscWoJVrEfw,2309040,2315680,clear  this wasn't much of a competition  the battle between shockwave and nomad
NscWoJVrEfw,2315680,2321280,was a blowout  shockwave had set the past seven records  in a row
NscWoJVrEfw,2321280,2326720,nomad hadn't set any  he remained in second place the entire  time
NscWoJVrEfw,2326720,2332400,sometimes even within a couple seconds  of the record  but never overtook him
NscWoJVrEfw,2332400,2340720,this was starting to become personal  nomad had to prove that he was still  capable of taking the record well
NscWoJVrEfw,2340720,2348140,he kept doing attempts  and on october 16th  nomad was gonna have his chance
NscWoJVrEfw,2348140,2356869,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,2359020,2366000,[Music]  he was three seconds ahead of his  personal best going into boxing but he
NscWoJVrEfw,2366000,2371680,had time to save there he could  theoretically get as low as a 7-10
NscWoJVrEfw,2371680,2378440,five seconds of wiggle room over the  record he just had to lock it down
NscWoJVrEfw,2379430,2384960,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,2385119,2389960,shockwave's record was 715.433
NscWoJVrEfw,2390320,2395640,nomads final time  715.733
NscWoJVrEfw,2396960,2403040,he had missed by less than a third of a  second  nomad could keep going
NscWoJVrEfw,2403040,2408079,it's not like he was far off from the  record  his next personal best would almost
NscWoJVrEfw,2408079,2413119,certainly be it and sure enough  the very next day
NscWoJVrEfw,2413119,2419200,he got himself a 7 14.  it was a new world record
NscWoJVrEfw,2419200,2425839,had it not been for shockwave getting  this just hours before
NscWoJVrEfw,2426400,2431839,an unbelievable record from shockwave  it had just about everything
NscWoJVrEfw,2431839,2437040,nearly perfect batting 4 pitch inning  great disconnect strats
NscWoJVrEfw,2437040,2442240,it just missed sub 7 because of a missed  shot on hole 4.
NscWoJVrEfw,2442240,2447680,nomad kept trying but at this point  shockwave was way in the lead
NscWoJVrEfw,2447680,2452800,it was going to be really tough  but he wasn't giving up he kept chipping
NscWoJVrEfw,2452800,2459280,away at his time  and by november he had gotten within a  stone's throw of the record
NscWoJVrEfw,2459280,2464960,a commonly used metric to determine a  runner's pace is best possible time
NscWoJVrEfw,2464960,2470160,it can be measured from any point in the  run  if the runner matched all of their best
NscWoJVrEfw,2470160,2476160,splits from a certain spot in the run to  the end  it measures what time they would get
NscWoJVrEfw,2476160,2483200,on november 12 2021  nomad exited baseball at 3 14.
NscWoJVrEfw,2483200,2490400,it was one of the fastest paces he had  ever been on  and his best possible time from there
NscWoJVrEfw,2490400,2496480,was 6 44.  this was a golden opportunity
NscWoJVrEfw,2496480,2501839,he entered bowling and started throwing  strike after strike
NscWoJVrEfw,2501839,2507359,five in a row then six  seven  eight and nine
NscWoJVrEfw,2507359,2512400,it was a perfect game  on one of his best paces ever
NscWoJVrEfw,2512400,2517680,he did lose a little time in frame 10  from slow falling pins but according to
NscWoJVrEfw,2517680,2524160,his splits  nomad's best possible time was still 6  48
NscWoJVrEfw,2524160,2531520,but one of the biggest run killers was  coming up in hole four  it's hard to get a birdie on this hole
NscWoJVrEfw,2531520,2537280,as winds can throw everything off and  make life harder nomad was gonna try to
NscWoJVrEfw,2537280,2544160,land in the bunker  then driver chip for a birdie  now more than ever
NscWoJVrEfw,2544160,2553619,this had to work  [Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,2553680,2560720,it was beautiful  he didn't get a hole in one so he  couldn't get in the 640s anymore but his
NscWoJVrEfw,2560720,2566960,best possible time was still 6 54.  this was doable
NscWoJVrEfw,2566960,2573760,three splits to go  but he had to get through hole five's  two disconnect shots
NscWoJVrEfw,2573760,2579839,shot one went well  but on shot two  he landed far from the hole
NscWoJVrEfw,2579839,2587440,it was tough  but nomad had to sink this putt  he had missed enough world records
NscWoJVrEfw,2587440,2594810,this shot had to be the difference  between all his past runs and a sub 7.
NscWoJVrEfw,2594810,2611040,[Music]
NscWoJVrEfw,2611040,2616319,players like emo ad nomad are often  overlooked in speedrunning
NscWoJVrEfw,2616319,2621520,shockwave is an incredible player as  evidenced by his nearly endless list of
NscWoJVrEfw,2621520,2627040,world records  but nomad's skill is right up there with  him
NscWoJVrEfw,2627040,2632480,people often focus on the world records  but really the path to getting there is
NscWoJVrEfw,2632480,2640000,what's important  nomad has had a lot of near misses  but he's going to break through
NscWoJVrEfw,2640000,2645680,his sub 7 dream might not be done yet  but the journey it took him to get there
NscWoJVrEfw,2645680,2653440,is what will make it feel so great  and  really  that's what speedrunning is all about
