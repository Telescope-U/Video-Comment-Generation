2NFDajQyliU,78320,81360,this about a box this is the thing that
2NFDajQyliU,81360,83200,got me to turn on the camera knowing

2NFDajQyliU,105840,107600,was no key it was just under lock was
2NFDajQyliU,107600,109360,the chocolate i suspected that it might
2NFDajQyliU,109360,111040,be a puzzle that i needed to solve oh
2NFDajQyliU,111040,113200,game on i think the chocolate is inside
2NFDajQyliU,113200,114560,but i have to figure out the code for

2NFDajQyliU,116079,118159,youtubers it can't be that hard okay
2NFDajQyliU,118159,119680,maybe i was a little bit harsh to my
2NFDajQyliU,119680,121520,fellow tubers anyway it was a time to
2NFDajQyliU,121520,123840,lock so no puzzle solving necessary and
2NFDajQyliU,123840,125119,the rest of the morning was spent
2NFDajQyliU,125119,126560,munching on chocolate and building a
2NFDajQyliU,126560,127990,bike
2NFDajQyliU,127990,134480,[Music]

2NFDajQyliU,139520,141280,beast's newest business but for the rest
2NFDajQyliU,141280,142800,of the world it came in the middle of an
2NFDajQyliU,142800,144400,escape room challenge where he leads
2NFDajQyliU,144400,146319,them into a room ripped straight out of

2NFDajQyliU,164080,166640,new tesla those are all possible prizes
2NFDajQyliU,166640,168959,but they pale in comparison to the grand
2NFDajQyliU,168959,171360,prize winner who gets to go home as the
2NFDajQyliU,171360,174160,owner of mr beast's chocolate factory
2NFDajQyliU,174160,175680,because who doesn't want the joy of
2NFDajQyliU,175680,177680,paying annual property taxes on a large
2NFDajQyliU,177680,179440,warehouse and being legally liable for

2NFDajQyliU,181200,183440,operational food producer truly the

2NFDajQyliU,189519,191040,earnings of the company or something
2NFDajQyliU,191040,192720,like that it's not like jimmy is pulling
2NFDajQyliU,192720,194720,a willy wonka by trying to offload his
2NFDajQyliU,194720,196400,business due to osha violations
2NFDajQyliU,196400,197760,something that we actually explored
2NFDajQyliU,197760,199760,heavily in the past film theory but both
2NFDajQyliU,199760,202560,jimmy and wonka are two in a long line
2NFDajQyliU,202560,204799,of wacky giveaways involving food if you
2NFDajQyliU,204799,206720,grew up in the 90s you might remember
2NFDajQyliU,206720,208640,this one don't eat that oreo if you find
2NFDajQyliU,208640,210799,an oreo like this you're an instant cash
2NFDajQyliU,210799,213200,winner
2NFDajQyliU,213200,216239,uh excuse me oreos have a design guess i
2NFDajQyliU,216239,218400,never noticed as i inhale them whole
2NFDajQyliU,218400,220720,like a hungry kirby and this isn't just
2NFDajQyliU,220720,223200,a relic of the 80s and 90s oreos decided
2NFDajQyliU,223200,224959,to celebrate their 110th birthday by
2NFDajQyliU,224959,226720,doing basically the same thing mr beast
2NFDajQyliU,226720,228640,is doing right now certain oreo products
2NFDajQyliU,228640,230239,contain codes that you scan to win
2NFDajQyliU,230239,231840,prizes like a dream vacation or a
2NFDajQyliU,231840,234000,lifetime supply of oreos last year red
2NFDajQyliU,234000,235920,lobster gave away 1 million rewards
2NFDajQyliU,235920,237760,points to people placing a to-go order
2NFDajQyliU,237760,239519,mcdonald's monopoly is a yearly
2NFDajQyliU,239519,241040,tradition with these sorts of giveaways
2NFDajQyliU,241040,243040,but the most famous or perhaps the most
2NFDajQyliU,243040,244480,infamous of all of them have to be the
2NFDajQyliU,244480,246720,coca-cola magic hands from 1990. i
2NFDajQyliU,246720,248319,mentioned this one briefly a few weeks
2NFDajQyliU,248319,250640,back during our space flavored coca-cola
2NFDajQyliU,250640,252080,episode but it got a lot of requests
2NFDajQyliU,252080,253920,from you guys asking for more details so
2NFDajQyliU,253920,255920,here we are while modern giveaways have
2NFDajQyliU,255920,257919,you scanning qr codes or looking for
2NFDajQyliU,257919,260079,winning bottle caps the magic hands were
2NFDajQyliU,260079,262320,cans that looked like regular coke cans
2NFDajQyliU,262320,263759,but were actually fitted with a
2NFDajQyliU,263759,265840,spring-loaded mechanism that would eject
2NFDajQyliU,265840,268080,a prize sometimes it was cash ranging
2NFDajQyliU,268080,270639,from one dollar to 500 sometimes it was
2NFDajQyliU,270639,272639,a coupon for vacations or merchandise
2NFDajQyliU,272639,274400,and sometimes the whole mechanism didn't
2NFDajQyliU,274400,276720,work because duh this was an insane idea
2NFDajQyliU,276720,278400,now as you can probably figure out a lot
2NFDajQyliU,278400,279680,of the weight of a can of coke is
2NFDajQyliU,279680,281199,actually coming from the liquid inside
2NFDajQyliU,281199,283360,of it so in order to make the prize cans
2NFDajQyliU,283360,285199,indistinguishable from the regular cans
2NFDajQyliU,285199,287040,they filled a separate compartment in
2NFDajQyliU,287040,289440,the cans with water but it wasn't just
2NFDajQyliU,289440,291120,any water to make it clear that this was
2NFDajQyliU,291120,292880,water that you should not be drinking
2NFDajQyliU,292880,294720,they also filled the can with ammonium
2NFDajQyliU,294720,296400,sulfate the same stuff that makes your
2NFDajQyliU,296400,299120,stink bombs smell like farts so you pop
2NFDajQyliU,299120,300960,open your magic can and are greeted with
2NFDajQyliU,300960,303600,the delightful smell of past gas nothing
2NFDajQyliU,303600,305840,like the sweet smell of victory some of
2NFDajQyliU,305840,307440,the cans started to leak and now you had
2NFDajQyliU,307440,309520,yourself leaking fart gas water
2NFDajQyliU,309520,312240,everywhere as you can imagine this promo
2NFDajQyliU,312240,314320,stank anyway mega corporations like
2NFDajQyliU,314320,316320,coca-cola don't spend millions on
2NFDajQyliU,316320,318080,over-engineered fart cans for the
2NFDajQyliU,318080,320160,funsies these sorts of giveaways exist
2NFDajQyliU,320160,321919,for marketing and while magic hands may
2NFDajQyliU,321919,323520,have fizzled mr beast's chocolate
2NFDajQyliU,323520,324720,giveaway seems to have found the
2NFDajQyliU,324720,326880,figurative and literal sweet spot people
2NFDajQyliU,326880,328800,are outright scalping these things
2NFDajQyliU,328800,331120,charging up to 15
2NFDajQyliU,331120,333039,for a single chocolate bar and people
2NFDajQyliU,333039,335520,are buying them which honestly makes no
2NFDajQyliU,335520,337039,sense since it's not like this is a
2NFDajQyliU,337039,338960,limited quantity thing chocolate is
2NFDajQyliU,338960,340720,still available via the official
2NFDajQyliU,340720,342880,feastables website for its normal price
2NFDajQyliU,342880,344400,what you do in internet for others
2NFDajQyliU,344400,345759,though it seems like the chocolate is
2NFDajQyliU,345759,347360,merely a distraction with people
2NFDajQyliU,347360,349520,flocking to sites like ebay to sell mr
2NFDajQyliU,349520,351680,beast feastables no codes trying to
2NFDajQyliU,351680,352960,unload the chocolate after having
2NFDajQyliU,352960,354720,already redeemed their chance for a
2NFDajQyliU,354720,356960,prize to which i say guys it's chocolate
2NFDajQyliU,356960,358639,what are you doing you spend three
2NFDajQyliU,358639,360479,dollars on a lottery ticket to win and
2NFDajQyliU,360479,362160,then you throw away the best parts but
2NFDajQyliU,362160,363600,think about what i just said three
2NFDajQyliU,363600,365680,dollars for a lottery ticket we live in
2NFDajQyliU,365680,367520,the united states a country where it's
2NFDajQyliU,367520,370000,illegal for private businesses to run
2NFDajQyliU,370000,372000,lotteries in fact u.s regulators have
2NFDajQyliU,372000,373520,been cracking down on this sort of stuff
2NFDajQyliU,373520,376240,since the 1970s so
2NFDajQyliU,376240,378479,what gives this chocolate giveaway is
2NFDajQyliU,378479,380560,gambling right you pay money for a
2NFDajQyliU,380560,382400,chance to win a prize same thing with
2NFDajQyliU,382400,384639,coke's magic hands or oreo giveaways or
2NFDajQyliU,384639,386400,even the mcdonald's monopoly it's the
2NFDajQyliU,386400,388639,sort of thing that seems on paper like
2NFDajQyliU,388639,390240,it should get dinged by the government
2NFDajQyliU,390240,391840,and yet like we just covered food
2NFDajQyliU,391840,393360,sweepstakes promotions like this have
2NFDajQyliU,393360,395120,been going on for decades is there some
2NFDajQyliU,395120,397199,sort of special exemption for food is it
2NFDajQyliU,397199,399120,because the lottery ticket is edible
2NFDajQyliU,399120,401440,well today we're looking at the legality
2NFDajQyliU,401440,403919,of lotteries which at first glance might
2NFDajQyliU,403919,405840,seem like a random thing for us to cover
2NFDajQyliU,405840,407600,here on food theory but by the end i'll
2NFDajQyliU,407600,410000,be giving you your best and lowest
2NFDajQyliU,410000,412400,calorie chance at winning mr beast's
2NFDajQyliU,412400,414080,chocolate factory let's have someone
2NFDajQyliU,414080,416000,from the fierce community take it home
2NFDajQyliU,416000,417360,okay so when it comes to legally
2NFDajQyliU,417360,419280,defining gambling there's a three point
2NFDajQyliU,419280,421199,test the first condition is having a
2NFDajQyliU,421199,422960,prize something can't legally be
2NFDajQyliU,422960,424560,considered gambling if there's no prize
2NFDajQyliU,424560,425919,for winning and this one kind of goes
2NFDajQyliU,425919,427520,without saying anytime mr beast is
2NFDajQyliU,427520,429120,involved there are definitely prizes at
2NFDajQyliU,429120,430639,stake and this is no exception
2NFDajQyliU,430639,432720,regardless of whether it's money teslas
2NFDajQyliU,432720,434960,or chocolate factories so the second
2NFDajQyliU,434960,436960,thing to define gambling is chance that
2NFDajQyliU,436960,439360,is the outcome is randomly determined
2NFDajQyliU,439360,440960,this means that a mr beast challenge
2NFDajQyliU,440960,443120,based on skill like an escape room or an
2NFDajQyliU,443120,444639,endurance test of staying inside of a
2NFDajQyliU,444639,446240,circle or trying to hit a target with a
2NFDajQyliU,446240,447520,basketball while dropping it from a
2NFDajQyliU,447520,449919,helicopter do not count as gambling
2NFDajQyliU,449919,451360,those are situations where you have
2NFDajQyliU,451360,453280,control over the outcome based on your
2NFDajQyliU,453280,455520,own abilities they are games of skill
2NFDajQyliU,455520,458240,not games of chance though when you stop
2NFDajQyliU,458240,460000,and think about it dropping a basketball
2NFDajQyliU,460000,462319,from a helicopter into a basketball hoop
2NFDajQyliU,462319,464160,at a certain point it does actually
2NFDajQyliU,464160,466000,amount to random chance no amount of
2NFDajQyliU,466000,468000,skill is actually helping you win that
2NFDajQyliU,468000,470240,right got so many variables the odds
2NFDajQyliU,470240,472720,basically amount to a lottery hey legal
2NFDajQyliU,472720,474319,eagle can you do an episode about this
2NFDajQyliU,474319,476879,where does skill end and chance begin
2NFDajQyliU,476879,478240,when it comes to gambling because also
2NFDajQyliU,478240,480080,like what about poker poker is a game of
2NFDajQyliU,480080,481520,skill i mean yeah you're paying to get
2NFDajQyliU,481520,483599,in and the cards are randomly given to
2NFDajQyliU,483599,485440,you but there's skill involved with
2NFDajQyliU,485440,487039,winning a game of poker the ultimate
2NFDajQyliU,487039,488400,winner is not about who has the best
2NFDajQyliU,488400,490319,cards about who plays the cards the best
2NFDajQyliU,490319,492080,it's weird anyway stepping out of the
2NFDajQyliU,492080,494319,gray area here games involving dice
2NFDajQyliU,494319,496319,rolls coin flips spinning off roulette
2NFDajQyliU,496319,498319,wheels those are gonna be where gambling
2NFDajQyliU,498319,500240,laws start to enter ditto for any game
2NFDajQyliU,500240,501440,where you personally don't have the
2NFDajQyliU,501440,503120,ability to influence the outcome of the
2NFDajQyliU,503120,505280,game like betting on sports throwing a
2NFDajQyliU,505280,506960,basketball is considered a game of skill
2NFDajQyliU,506960,509039,but predicting which team is gonna win
2NFDajQyliU,509039,510639,is a game of chance since you're
2NFDajQyliU,510639,512240,guessing on an event whose outcome you
2NFDajQyliU,512240,514560,have no control over and so again the mr
2NFDajQyliU,514560,516399,beast feastables challenge falls into
2NFDajQyliU,516399,518240,this category unlike a lot of his other
2NFDajQyliU,518240,520240,videos winning this particular contest
2NFDajQyliU,520240,521919,is simply a matter of buying a candy bar
2NFDajQyliU,521919,523599,that happens to have the golden ticket
2NFDajQyliU,523599,526160,it is pure randomness no different from
2NFDajQyliU,526160,527600,the roll of a dice or the spin of a
2NFDajQyliU,527600,529279,roulette wheel in fact if you actually
2NFDajQyliU,529279,530959,enter a code the festival's website
2NFDajQyliU,530959,533200,outright has a roulette wheel it's not a
2NFDajQyliU,533200,535200,real roulette wheel clearly it lands on
2NFDajQyliU,535200,537040,no win way more than the odds the wheel
2NFDajQyliU,537040,538399,would allow but just thought it was
2NFDajQyliU,538399,540080,worth mentioning so that's two strikes
2NFDajQyliU,540080,541680,against it but how does mr beast's
2NFDajQyliU,541680,543200,feastable giveaway fare against test
2NFDajQyliU,543200,545600,number three that would be consideration
2NFDajQyliU,545600,547279,i.e that you're required to give up
2NFDajQyliU,547279,548800,something of value in order to
2NFDajQyliU,548800,550399,participate if you're paying for an
2NFDajQyliU,550399,552480,entry then yeah it's gambling this means
2NFDajQyliU,552480,554320,that all the giveaway challenges in mr
2NFDajQyliU,554320,556320,beast's videos aren't gambling in his
2NFDajQyliU,556320,558080,videos where he just randomly gives cash
2NFDajQyliU,558080,559440,to strangers yeah he's giving away a
2NFDajQyliU,559440,561120,prize and yeah the people don't have
2NFDajQyliU,561120,563200,control over whether they win or not but
2NFDajQyliU,563200,564720,it's not gambling because those people
2NFDajQyliU,564720,567120,don't have to pay to participate in fact
2NFDajQyliU,567120,568399,in most cases they didn't even know they
2NFDajQyliU,568399,570160,were participating until jimmy dumps
2NFDajQyliU,570160,572160,money on him but with feastables it's
2NFDajQyliU,572160,574160,different the entire point is that you
2NFDajQyliU,574160,576399,enter by paying money sure you get a
2NFDajQyliU,576399,578000,chocolate bar out of it just like with
2NFDajQyliU,578000,579839,mcdonald's monopoly and getting a large
2NFDajQyliU,579839,581760,fry or with magic hands and you getting
2NFDajQyliU,581760,583920,some fart water but the law doesn't care
2NFDajQyliU,583920,585839,about that if you're paying money for
2NFDajQyliU,585839,587920,entry into a contest where you can win a
2NFDajQyliU,587920,589920,prize and the outcome is left to chance
2NFDajQyliU,589920,592160,then yes it's gambling so it would seem
2NFDajQyliU,592160,594240,like the chocolate factory giveaway is
2NFDajQyliU,594240,596959,illegal here in the us right but it and
2NFDajQyliU,596959,599360,mcdonald's monopoly and oreo giveaways
2NFDajQyliU,599360,600880,and magic hands none of them are getting
2NFDajQyliU,600880,603200,shut down so what gives how are they all
2NFDajQyliU,603200,604800,getting away with it what is the
2NFDajQyliU,604800,607360,loophole well it all comes down to three
2NFDajQyliU,607360,610000,simple legally important words no
2NFDajQyliU,610000,611760,purchase necessary remember that the
2NFDajQyliU,611760,613279,last of the three legally required
2NFDajQyliU,613279,614399,elements that we talked about for
2NFDajQyliU,614399,616480,gambling is consideration the idea that
2NFDajQyliU,616480,618240,the only way to win is by staking your
2NFDajQyliU,618240,620160,own money to pay to enter the game but
2NFDajQyliU,620160,621839,if it's possible to enter the contest
2NFDajQyliU,621839,623839,and win without paying money then you're
2NFDajQyliU,623839,626079,all gucci fam take for example the red
2NFDajQyliU,626079,628240,lobster sweepstakes true a lot of people
2NFDajQyliU,628240,629839,entered the giveaway by paying money to
2NFDajQyliU,629839,631680,place it to go order but technically
2NFDajQyliU,631680,633360,speaking you could win prizes in that
2NFDajQyliU,633360,635360,contest without paying red lobster a
2NFDajQyliU,635360,637200,dime by downloading the app and
2NFDajQyliU,637200,638880,registering an account this means that

2NFDajQyliU,640320,642320,sweepstakes as no purchase necessary
2NFDajQyliU,642320,644000,thereby meaning that they didn't meet
2NFDajQyliU,644000,646240,the legal definition of gambling true
2NFDajQyliU,646240,648399,the vast majority of people entered that
2NFDajQyliU,648399,649920,giveaway by paying money to place a
2NFDajQyliU,649920,652000,to-go order but technically speaking
2NFDajQyliU,652000,653760,they could win prizes in the contest
2NFDajQyliU,653760,656079,without paying red lobster a dime by
2NFDajQyliU,656079,657519,simply downloading the app and
2NFDajQyliU,657519,659680,registering an account this allows red
2NFDajQyliU,659680,661600,lobster to advertise the sweepstakes as
2NFDajQyliU,661600,663680,no purchase necessary thereby meaning
2NFDajQyliU,663680,665040,that they don't meet the legal
2NFDajQyliU,665040,667279,definition of gambling ditto for that

2NFDajQyliU,734480,736720,trying to resell chocolate over on ebay

2NFDajQyliU,771600,773360,in a hand-addressed envelope with no
2NFDajQyliU,773360,775200,photocopied or mechanically reproduced
2NFDajQyliU,775200,776639,entries but hey at least they're not

2NFDajQyliU,782160,784399,most 100 entries thanks to the hundreds
2NFDajQyliU,784399,785839,of dollars on chocolate that they're
2NFDajQyliU,785839,787760,buying for a few hours of your time
2NFDajQyliU,787760,789600,you're gonna be submitting hundreds more
2NFDajQyliU,789600,792079,entries for next to zero cost no joke
2NFDajQyliU,792079,794079,instead of at minimum a three dollar
2NFDajQyliU,794079,796000,buy-in for a single chocolate bar you're
2NFDajQyliU,796000,798160,spending around 60 cents per entry and
2NFDajQyliU,798160,799920,these sorts of things do work when i was
2NFDajQyliU,799920,801519,a kid my family actually did this for
2NFDajQyliU,801519,803040,baseball tickets there was a big
2NFDajQyliU,803040,804880,giveaway for world series tickets and my
2NFDajQyliU,804880,806480,family spent an entire evening just
2NFDajQyliU,806480,808399,handwriting envelopes in total i think
2NFDajQyliU,808399,810720,we submitted like a hundred i was eight
2NFDajQyliU,810720,813040,so i contributed about five of those but
2NFDajQyliU,813040,815519,hey we won and we got to see a world
2NFDajQyliU,815519,817440,series game and for years i've been
2NFDajQyliU,817440,819120,convinced that it was one of my five
2NFDajQyliU,819120,820800,entries that got selected to be fair
2NFDajQyliU,820800,822079,though it was probably disqualified for
2NFDajQyliU,822079,823839,being illegible but still child can
2NFDajQyliU,823839,826240,dream like i said time is wasting as
2NFDajQyliU,826240,827920,this video goes up you have like three
2NFDajQyliU,827920,829760,days to get this done everything needs

2NFDajQyliU,846399,848240,factory and like i said getting that
