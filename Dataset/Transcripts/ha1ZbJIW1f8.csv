ha1ZbJIW1f8,8880,13200,i think one of the most important findings  in the last few years in neuroscience is that  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,14240,22480,while the molecule dopamine is associated with  reward it's more about motivation and craving  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,23280,30080,there's a really classic experiment now that  people use to demonstrate this take two rats  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,30080,37920,and the rats independently separate cages can  lever press for food or when they can access food  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,39280,43360,there's a little bit of dopamine that's released  anytime they get some food so we always thought  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,43360,51200,that food like many other rewards like food sex  warmth when you're cold cool when you're too warm  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,52000,58640,is triggering the release of dopamine but someone  had the good idea to deplete dopamine in one of  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,58640,66720,those animals and then what you find is that the  animal without dopamine still enjoys food still  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,66720,71120,enjoys other pleasures so dopamine is not really  involved in the enjoyment of those pleasures  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,71120,76320,it's involved in motivation because if you make  the animal have to move just one rat's length  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,77120,83040,believe it or not to get to that lever the animal  with dopamine will work to go get that thing it  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,83040,88880,will work through some effort to go get the reward  whereas the animal or turns out the human without  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,88880,95200,much dopamine can still experience pleasure they  can sit on their couch and cram their face with  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,95200,100240,pleasure inducing calories or what have  you watch pleasure inducing things on the  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,100240,105759,television but they have very little motivation to  go pursue things that will deliver them pleasure  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,105760,110800,it's actually what's really driven the forward  evolution of our our species has been the desire  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,110800,115440,to go seek things beyond the confines of our  skin and when i say the common currency is  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,115440,120800,dopamine what i mean is the molecule dopamine  when secreted in the brain makes us pursue  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,120800,126800,things build things create things makes us want  new things that we don't currently already have  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,126800,130880,and so it has a lot of dimensions to it but rather  than think about dopamine as a signal for reward  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,130880,136240,like a dopamine hit we classically think to talk  about it it's more accurate really to think about  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,136240,142480,dopamine as driving motivation and craving to  go seek rewards that's the rad experiment and  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,142480,147840,it's a way of tabulating where we are in our life  are we doing well or are we doing poorly and that  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,147840,152879,happens on very short time scales like you wake up  feeling good or do you wake up feeling kind of low  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,153440,159680,or on long time scales if you're halfway through  a long degree or you're halfway through your life  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,159680,164000,how are you doing how do you gauge that well it  has everything to do with how much dopamine you  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,164000,168400,were releasing in the previous days and weeks and  years so you're always comparing and all of this  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,168400,173280,is subconscious but what's cool is that once you  make these processes conscious once you understand  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,173280,177920,a little bit about how dopamine is released and  how it changes our perspective and our behavior  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,177920,181200,then you can actually work with it and so  we go back to this example the person that's  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,181200,185680,not motivated that can't get off the couch  that doesn't want to do anything well this  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,185680,190719,is the problem they are effectively the rat  with no dopamine but they can still achieve  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,191440,196880,some sense of pleasure by consuming excess  calories by consuming social media and look i'm  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,196880,201840,not judging i do this stuff too right scrolling  social media if you've ever scrolled social media  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,201840,206400,and you're like i don't even know why i'm  doing this it doesn't really feel that good  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,207200,210319,and i can remember a time where you'd  see something it was just so cool or you  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,210320,214320,see something online i remember this when ted  talks first came out i was like this is amazing  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,214320,218480,these are some at least some of them are really  smart people sharing really cool insights  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,218480,223680,and then now that they're like a gazillion ted  talks i remember spending a winter in my office at  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,223680,229040,when i was a junior professor cleaning my office  finally and binging ted talks in the background  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,229040,233599,thinking this is a good use of my time pretty soon  they all sucked to me i was like this isn't good  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,233600,238960,so what you need to do is stop watching dead docs  for a while wait and then they become interesting  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,238960,244000,again and that's this pain pleasure balance and  so for people that aren't feeling motivated the  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,244000,248880,problem is they're not motivated but they're  getting just enough or excess sustenance so  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,248880,253840,they're getting the little mild hits of opioid  it becomes an opioid system and if you think  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,253840,259040,about the opioid drugs as opposed to dopamine  dopaminergic drugs dopaminergic drugs make people  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,259040,263280,rabid for everything you know drugs of abuse  like cocaine amphetamine make people incredibly  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,263280,268800,outward directed or they hardly notice anything  except what they want more of one more more it's  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,268800,275120,very it's bad because those drugs trigger so much  dopamine release that they become the reward it's  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,275120,279199,very circular the only the drug can give that  much dopamine nothing they could pursue would  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,279200,285440,give them as much dopamine as the drug itself so  there's that and then there's the kind of opioid  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,285440,291360,like effects of constantly indulging oneself  with social media or with video games or with  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,292240,297120,with food or with anything to the point where  it no longer evokes the motivation and craving  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,297120,301840,and this is really the new evolution of the  understanding of dopamine in neuro in neuroscience  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,301840,307360,which is that dopamine itself is not the reward  it's the build up to the reward and the reward has  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,307360,313599,more of a kind of opioid bliss-like property which  itself is not bad if it's endogenous released from  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,313600,318480,within but when we can just sit there like  the like the rat with no dopamine gorging  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,318480,324320,ourselves with pleasures so to speak what you end  up with is somebody that feels really unmotivated  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,324320,328560,and those pleasures no longer work to tickle  those feel good circuits and so there's no  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,328560,335680,reason for them to go out and pursue anything  the problem is not pleasures the problem is that  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,335680,342800,pleasure experienced without prior requirement  for pursuit is terrible for us it's terrible  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,342800,348479,for us as individuals it's terrible for us as as  groups and i have great confidence in the human  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,348480,353280,species to work this out but we are finding  now and we are going to increasingly find  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,353280,358000,that those who will be successful young or old  are going to be those people who can create their  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,358000,363360,own internal buffers they're going to be able to  control their relationship to pleasures because  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,363360,368639,the proximity to pleasures and the availability  is the problem if you look at the increase in  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,369760,375840,use of drugs of abuse or prescription medication  which at least at the first past deliver pleasure  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,375840,382000,pain relief the whole issue with the opioid crisis  and dopaminergic drugs like ritalin adderall you  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,382000,385520,know there is sometimes there's a clinical need  but tons of people are taking those recreationally  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,385520,392080,now or to study huge dopamine increases are what  those cause that is a problem that's a serious  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,392080,397919,problem because it creates a cycle where you you  need more of that specific thing i always say  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,397920,402000,addiction is a progressive narrowing of the  things that bring you pleasure god that's  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,402000,405920,such a good difference and you know and i don't  like to comment too much on enlightenment because  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,405920,410240,you know i don't really know what that is as a  neurobiologist but a good life we could say is  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,410240,414639,a progressive expansion of the things that bring  you pleasure and even better is a good life is a  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,414640,419120,progressive expansion of the things that bring you  pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,419120,424560,and hard work and understanding this pain pleasure  balance whereby if you experience pain and you can  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,424560,430560,continue to be in that friction and exert effort  the rewards are that much greater when they arrive  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,431200,436800,and so i think that if you look at any drug  of abuse or any situation where somebody  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,436800,441759,isn't motivated or thinks that now they may  have clinically diagnosed attention deficit  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,441760,446640,hyperactivity disorder but a lot of what people  think is adhd it turns out is people just over  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,446640,453440,consuming dopamine from various sources and then  and also the context within a tick-tock feed is  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,453440,457600,the context switch is insane the brain has never  seen first of all there's the first time in human  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,457600,462320,evolution that we wrote with our thumbs but that's  a pretty benign shift and that the other shift is  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,462880,467840,normally you walk from one room to another or from  a field into the trees or from a hut into or a  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,467840,473120,house or whatever it is but now you can get 10 000  context switches in that 30 minutes of scrolling  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,473120,477919,on instagram or to talk and so it's all about  self-regulation we are going to select for the  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,477920,482880,people that can self-regulate and so then people  say well how do you self-regulate how do kids  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,482880,487360,self-regulate well this is my hope and one of the  reasons i've gotten excited about public education  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,487360,492960,and teaching neuroscience is that this is a place  where knowledge of knowledge actually can allow  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,492960,497840,oneself to intervene when you think i'm feeling  low i don't feel good nothing really feels like  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,497840,503760,am i depressed maybe but maybe you're just you've  saturated the dopamine circuits you're now in the  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,503760,509360,pain part of things what do you do well you have  to stop you need you need to replenish dopamine  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,509360,514240,you need to stop engaging with this behavior  and then your pleasure for it will come back  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,514240,519120,but you have to constantly control the hinge it's  not just about being back and forth on the seesaw  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,519120,523680,you have to make sure the hinge doesn't get stuck  in pain or in pleasure understanding that pain  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,523680,528720,and pleasure in this really dynamic balance  can also help us which in the following way  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,529440,534320,any pain that you feel the longer day the less  sleep the the kind of agony that things aren't  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,534320,537760,working that power outlet doesn't work  or the internet is slow whatever it is  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,539040,545680,the amount of pleasure that you will eventually  experience is directly relation related excuse me  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,545680,550560,to how much pain you experience so we know this  from actually what nowadays would be considered  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,550560,554160,quite barbaric and unethical experiments  where they would give people electrical shocks  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,554800,559519,and they would measure their response and then  they'd say we're going to increase it we're  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,559520,564720,going to increase it eventually they get to the  point where a slight uh shock that was previously  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,564720,569120,very painful actually evokes a sense of pleasure  now you couldn't do these experiments anymore  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,569120,575120,these are not the experiments i do in my lab and  these are older experiments but for instance i  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,575120,580320,and this has been discussed in scientific research  papers uh giving somebody a like a ten minute ice  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,580320,584800,bath for instance or even a three-minute ice bath  or a one-minute ice bath it's quite painful but  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,584800,589600,there was a study from the university of prague  uh european journal physiology showed that  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,589600,596000,after a painful ice bath stimulus the amount of  dopamine release goes up for two and a half hours  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,596000,602720,to 250 percent above baseline and that's not  because the ice bath itself evokes dopamine  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,602720,608000,release a lot of people think oh cold water of ox  dopamine release no pain evokes dopamine release  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,608000,613040,after the pain is over just understanding the more  friction and pain that you experience the greater  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,613040,618560,the dopamine reward you will get later and that  serves as its own amplifier of the whole process  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,618560,625200,of pursuing more dopamine so the the keys are to  pursue rewards but understand that the pursuit  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,625200,630880,is actually the reward if you want to have  repeated wins then what you realize is your  
ha1ZbJIW1f8,630880,645840,capacity to tap into dopamine as a motivator not  just seeking dopamine rewards that is infinite
ha1ZbJIW1f8,665920,666000,you
