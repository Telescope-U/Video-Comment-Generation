3gmTXDcFJN4,113439,121200,no sign up uh don't you worry about that  you just march right in sit right down
3gmTXDcFJN4,121200,127280,ah  let's see  looks like netflix is gonna add a lower
3gmTXDcFJN4,127280,132560,cost  ad supported tier ad supported
3gmTXDcFJN4,132560,137680,they're going they're not sure who  they're going to have help them out they  think maybe nbc universal that's a
3gmTXDcFJN4,137680,144160,comcast company  or perhaps google could sell those ads
3gmTXDcFJN4,144160,150560,um  comcast's video ad unit free wheel would
3gmTXDcFJN4,150560,156879,supply technology to serve the ads  hmm
3gmTXDcFJN4,156879,162160,i think you know it's probably the case  i mean netflix gets more and more  expensive all the time
3gmTXDcFJN4,162160,167760,it's probably the case that having a  lower cost ad-supported tier is not a  bad idea although you know you know hulu
3gmTXDcFJN4,167760,174400,does this  other other sites uh do it there's a lot  of  quote free tv in fact that's what amazon
3gmTXDcFJN4,174400,179680,calls it free tv that's ad supported hey  this show is free and ad supported
3gmTXDcFJN4,179680,186400,but it's free and ad supported i don't  like the idea of paying for something  and having ads in it that seems to be uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,186400,193200,is that greedy i don't know seems like  double dipping  but either is it is it free then adds i
3gmTXDcFJN4,193200,199920,understand they're paying for it that's  how that's how this show works  or is it paid and then there shouldn't
3gmTXDcFJN4,199920,205840,be any ads in fact we do offer  uh my podcast network add free versions  of all the podcasts
3gmTXDcFJN4,205840,213040,if you pay seven bucks a month you don't  have to listen to the ads that seems  fair right  uh it'd be weird if i said seven bucks a
3gmTXDcFJN4,213040,219440,month and i'm gonna put some ads in  there i know that bugs me  i guess netflix can't afford to do a
3gmTXDcFJN4,219440,226319,free tier that would be too much  that would be  way too much hey this is a scary idea i
3gmTXDcFJN4,226319,231760,wonder what doctor mom thinks about this  amazon  you know the echo the amazon echo
3gmTXDcFJN4,231760,238389,they're they're talking  speaker the one you talked to  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,238480,243760,at the conference this week the remars  conference which amazon holds every year
3gmTXDcFJN4,243760,250799,the company said it's announced it's  working on a feature  that can synthesize short audio clips of
3gmTXDcFJN4,250799,256400,a person's voice and then reprogram it  as longer speech they said we only need  a few a few minutes
3gmTXDcFJN4,256400,262160,of speech to be able to synthesize it a  few minutes of me talking you could have  me and your amazon echo but that's not
3gmTXDcFJN4,262160,267440,what they think is going to be the  golden  use of this the sweet spot
3gmTXDcFJN4,267440,272639,how about the voice of grandma  the voice
3gmTXDcFJN4,272639,281160,of a deceased loved one  is used to read grandson a bedtime story
3gmTXDcFJN4,284240,290639,i i i don't know what to say  uh  that sounds a little to me it sounds a
3gmTXDcFJN4,290639,296720,little creepy i mean it might be  might be kind of  a beautiful thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,296720,302720,do you want to hear the voices of your  deceased relatives emerging from your  amazon echo remember they're not going
3gmTXDcFJN4,302720,308400,to be well actually i don't know which  would be creepier if they were perfect  like grandma are you in there
3gmTXDcFJN4,308400,315600,that would be pretty creepy or if it's  sort of grandma  grandma as a robot
3gmTXDcFJN4,315600,318960,neither one sounds that good
3gmTXDcFJN4,320880,326240,they're both that creepy  i feel like uh any  jordan peel
3gmTXDcFJN4,326240,333039,is gonna do a  do a horror show  this is grandma
3gmTXDcFJN4,333520,338280,uh grandma in your echo
3gmTXDcFJN4,338880,345280,there have been actually sci-fi shows  about this very uh topic  the idea i mean imagine i mean the next
3gmTXDcFJN4,345280,350320,step is to make a uh an android a a a  thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,350320,355759,that looks like grandma with grandma's  voice that was walking around the house
3gmTXDcFJN4,362479,367600,oh  it's it's it's just so fascinating that  amazon amazon just says well you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,367600,373919,just offhand they'd even like you know  this might be weird or what do you think  they just said hey by the way
3gmTXDcFJN4,373919,379600,here's what is another thing we're going  to do all we need is a few minutes of  grandma's voice we can make a make your
3gmTXDcFJN4,379600,385280,amazon echo sound like grandma  oh  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,385280,390479,yikes  yikes
3gmTXDcFJN4,390479,395919,that is that is  weird average american home uses a
3gmTXDcFJN4,395919,402080,record  6.8 over the top services like netflix
3gmTXDcFJN4,402080,408800,have you noticed that they're kind of  multiplying like topsy you got netflix  you got peacock you got paramount plus
3gmTXDcFJN4,408800,414000,hulu  hulu used to be an umbrella for uh you  know
3gmTXDcFJN4,414000,419120,several different companies the networks  and so forth but then  they spun it out i think mostly hulu's
3gmTXDcFJN4,419120,426080,owned by disney now which is weird  because disney has its own channel  disney plus  there's youtube youtube tv there's
3gmTXDcFJN4,426080,432800,amazon prime video  hbo max apple tv plus  peacock
3gmTXDcFJN4,432800,437919,and the average merc  american if there is such a thing i  don't know is there such a thing as an
3gmTXDcFJN4,437919,444680,average american i don't think so but  the average uh american has 6.88
3gmTXDcFJN4,445440,450880,of these  streaming devices in the home
3gmTXDcFJN4,450880,457840,i think that number probably went up a  lot when we were stuck at home for the  last two years watching tv to excess
3gmTXDcFJN4,457840,463520,in fact it's i feel kind of bad for  netflix because netflix of course like  all the other streaming services grew
3gmTXDcFJN4,463520,470319,enormously  since 2020  but then as the pandemic eases so did
3gmTXDcFJN4,470319,477039,its subscribers in a large number well  somewhat large number of the people new  subscribers dropped off about 100 000
3gmTXDcFJN4,477039,482080,causing netflix stock to tumble  tumble tumble tumble netflix has been
3gmTXDcFJN4,482080,487360,laying people off they just laid off  another 300 people this week  they're looking at ads
3gmTXDcFJN4,487360,494639,they're in deep doo-doo  but that's not that's a that's a um  manufactured problem
3gmTXDcFJN4,494639,499840,that's a problem manufactured by  the demands the short-term needs of the
3gmTXDcFJN4,499840,507280,stock market  the stock market says if you're not  growing every quarter constantly
3gmTXDcFJN4,507280,513200,we're not going to buy your stock and if  you start to tumble a little bit we're  going to definitely get rid of your  stock and you're going to your stock's
3gmTXDcFJN4,513200,520080,going to go through the floor which  means you're not going to be able to  attract employees current employees are  going to leave it's it's a it's a it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,520080,526480,like a jenga you know you're pulling out  that and everything falls over  and it's not that the company isn't
3gmTXDcFJN4,526480,532160,profitable it is  it is it's very profitable it's making a  lot of money
3gmTXDcFJN4,532160,537200,i don't even know if there's clouds  storm clouds on the horizon it's just  that they had a lot of growth in the
3gmTXDcFJN4,537200,544560,first two years and then they it  retrenched a little bit  they're still ahead of where they were  in 2020. i don't get it
3gmTXDcFJN4,544560,551519,it's the stock market and that's a  problem i think because it means  companies have to do things not because
3gmTXDcFJN4,551519,557839,they're good for business or good for us  as users or customers  but what the stock market wants them to
3gmTXDcFJN4,557839,564000,do  hmm netflix and amazon prime video used
3gmTXDcFJN4,564000,569279,by more than half  of us internet households netflix is so  dominant when you get a
3gmTXDcFJN4,569279,575440,streaming tv device it often has a  netflix button on the device  like we know you want to use netflix
3gmTXDcFJN4,575440,582560,okay here's a button just for netflix  but  usage levels flat versus the first
3gmTXDcFJN4,582560,588320,quarter 2020. well nothing's going to  compare to the pandemic
3gmTXDcFJN4,588640,595440,i think flat's pretty good you're  holding on to those people that you got  in the in the beginning of the pandemic
3gmTXDcFJN4,595760,601120,espn plus  b-e-t plus crunchyroll amc plus fox
3gmTXDcFJN4,601120,608750,nation  stars and showtime also  doing well  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,610600,617519,6.6 services  but i think that if you look at that  that probably
3gmTXDcFJN4,617519,623200,parallels pretty closely  people who are getting rid of their  cable company right
3gmTXDcFJN4,623200,631800,oh and by the way i don't need the cable  company i've got 6.6  services full of content
3gmTXDcFJN4,632959,640480,i guess i don't know  have you played diablo's immortal on ios
3gmTXDcFJN4,640480,646880,or android oh there's a big  furore over that going on in the tech  world because it's one of those games
3gmTXDcFJN4,646880,653120,that's free to play but not free to win  and people can spend a hundred
3gmTXDcFJN4,653120,658959,thousand dollars yes  one hundred thousand dollars on the game
3gmTXDcFJN4,658959,664079,and beat everybody and be the the top  dog and then players who don't have that
3gmTXDcFJN4,664079,670079,kind of money obviously to spend or who  are just simply smart enough not to  spend it
3gmTXDcFJN4,670079,674440,are going hey that's not fair
3gmTXDcFJN4,675680,681920,i guess it's not  uh i just play it because it's fun  personally i and i'm not going to spend
3gmTXDcFJN4,681920,689839,a penny on it sorry  and you can play it without spending any  money on it it's completely free  but it's weird i guess it is weird
3gmTXDcFJN4,689839,694880,that there are uh it's possible to spend  so much money on it
3gmTXDcFJN4,694880,700240,that you cannot be beaten you're like  the king of the the king of the diablo  it's a game on
3gmTXDcFJN4,700240,707360,on ios and ipad  all right 88.88 ask leo that's kind of  some of the things on the tech agenda
3gmTXDcFJN4,707360,713360,this week we talk about anything you  want 888  827-5536 toll-free from anywhere in the
3gmTXDcFJN4,713360,718560,u.s or canada we'll go to your calls in  just a bit  also sammable salmon our car guy coming
3gmTXDcFJN4,718560,724399,up  hello sam  hello leo how are you today
3gmTXDcFJN4,724399,731839,i am doing well good it was good having  you on twitter on sunday thank you yeah  it was fun yeah really fun
3gmTXDcFJN4,731839,738240,always is  i got to
3gmTXDcFJN4,738240,743279,get uh did you you see my new uh gran  turismo rig here behind me
3gmTXDcFJN4,743279,750560,uh oh yeah you're gonna play gran  turismo in that thing wow  no  actually uh the ford truck simulator
3gmTXDcFJN4,750560,757680,that's what that is right yeah go visit  ford's new dynamic driving or driving  dynamics laboratory how cool is that um
3gmTXDcFJN4,757680,764160,it's  a  giant sim  uh that they can use to replicate the
3gmTXDcFJN4,764160,770399,entire suspension system different roads  all kinds of different things um and  also do
3gmTXDcFJN4,770399,777920,8as uh driving assistance systems uh  testing in here  um so we got to drive pretend we were
3gmTXDcFJN4,777920,785839,driving a ford maverick also ford  lightning on different road surfaces  um try some different stuff with the uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,785839,792959,adaptive cruise control  and it felt remarkably realistic
3gmTXDcFJN4,796079,802880,as uh it's a little little bit too much  for uh gran turismo those uh several  million dollars that they spent on this
3gmTXDcFJN4,802880,809040,well  if you could spend a hundred thousand  dollars to win diablo immortal  yeah you could spend a couple hundred
3gmTXDcFJN4,809040,814320,million for the best simulator ever  uh but you know i mean this this kind of
3gmTXDcFJN4,814320,821120,stuff saves them tens of millions of  dollars in development costs because  they can try out a lot of different
3gmTXDcFJN4,821120,826959,things with the uh different suspension  settings and different different systems  um
3gmTXDcFJN4,826959,833519,in the sim before they have to build  prototype parts and they can do it a lot  faster
3gmTXDcFJN4,834320,840800,very cool  yeah  i got to drive the cadillac lyric this
3gmTXDcFJN4,840800,846079,week as well but i can't talk about that  one till tuesday yeah i saw your  pictures on insta
3gmTXDcFJN4,846079,852240,i saw you on the insta  very nice  yeah  so that'll be on wheel bearings on
3gmTXDcFJN4,852240,858399,tuesday when the embargo lifts and then  uh  we'll talk about it here next sunday  cool
3gmTXDcFJN4,858399,864800,cool cool  yeah i guess a tesla's a driving
3gmTXDcFJN4,864800,870279,simulator in a way  very realistic
3gmTXDcFJN4,871760,877839,kind of  yeah it was fun uh when  when i first got into the simulator um
3gmTXDcFJN4,877839,885440,one of the things that they didn't  mention was that the uh  for the the model for the ford maverick
3gmTXDcFJN4,885440,891199,their small pickup truck they didn't  have the abs enabled in there and so i  just wanted to see what the simulator
3gmTXDcFJN4,891199,897199,would do under hard braking so i slammed  on the brakes and all of a sudden it  starts sliding around because there's no  abs
3gmTXDcFJN4,897199,904160,hey yay i felt felt just like a real car  with no abs yikes all right we'll talk  in a few
3gmTXDcFJN4,904160,911440,it's uh  kim shaffer but it's pronounced  sharday sean kim
3gmTXDcFJN4,911440,917600,chardee the unbreakable phone angels  hello kim i've been waiting for that one  for a while

3gmTXDcFJN4,936000,942639,who worked in radio in the uh in the 90s  know or 80s maybe no  but siri pronounces it right siri says

3gmTXDcFJN4,958160,963199,trevor thank you kim  leo laporte the tech guy welcome
3gmTXDcFJN4,963199,969040,leo two things first of all i called you  back in december i was looking for a  17-inch quiet laptop you recommended the
3gmTXDcFJN4,969040,976000,lg gram you're right on the mark thank  you it's nice quiet  since i purchased it why and thin
3gmTXDcFJN4,976000,982399,yes sir  the uh  so the reason i'm calling today is i'm a  third grade teacher in the south of fort
3gmTXDcFJN4,982399,987920,worth  my principal is looking into live video  announcements  and
3gmTXDcFJN4,987920,993519,so  wow we've come a long way  from the speaker in every classroom and  the
3gmTXDcFJN4,993519,999870,principal getting on oh no  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,999920,1006399,yeah so currently that's exactly that's  over the intercom yeah all that yeah  so i was doing some research so she
3gmTXDcFJN4,1006399,1013279,wants to have a screen in every room or  how to how does she want to do it well  we all so my school was built in 2007
3gmTXDcFJN4,1013279,1019519,they all came with projectors installed  in the ceiling very nice and so yeah we  can um
3gmTXDcFJN4,1019519,1025760,you know what i was looking at was using  uh open broadcast software with youtube  to stream
3gmTXDcFJN4,1025760,1032240,an announcement so i was looking at  different video equipment  i'm familiar with like the sony cameras  around 900 but i was looking for
3gmTXDcFJN4,1032240,1038319,something cheaper like maybe the zoom q8  and 4k  and then you what you'll hook it up to a
3gmTXDcFJN4,1038319,1044640,computer and then have the computer  stream it  yeah and then yeah so we have zero  equipment so i need to get the cameras
3gmTXDcFJN4,1044640,1050960,tripod green screen you said cameras you  know does she want  i'm saying she is it is she is the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1050960,1056559,principal of her or him yeah it's miss  lenderos ms landeros hi ms landers
3gmTXDcFJN4,1056559,1062080,um  do they want a two-camera shoot do they  they want like do you think they'll have
3gmTXDcFJN4,1062080,1067280,more than one camera or just one camera  well i think minimum of two one
3gmTXDcFJN4,1067280,1073600,for for her and then another camera  would be for the students  the students so she could see the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1073600,1078960,students or no  so the students could be like doing the  pledge of allegiance in one part of the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1078960,1084799,room i get it do some of the  announcements  as soon as you have more than one camera
3gmTXDcFJN4,1084799,1090320,it gets more complicated because uh  obviously you have to have a switcher
3gmTXDcFJN4,1090640,1097600,uh there is a switcher i mean yeah i  know your budget's tight i'll mention  this there's a switcher from blackmagic
3gmTXDcFJN4,1097600,1103440,design blackmagicdesign.com called the  atem mini  pro
3gmTXDcFJN4,1103440,1108640,which streams direct it's a switcher  that streams direct you could hook up up  to four cameras they could be any camera
3gmTXDcFJN4,1108640,1115280,that supports hdmi  so yeah you can get cheap honestly i  would get cheap consumer camcorders
3gmTXDcFJN4,1115280,1120799,you know you can't nobody's buying  camcorders anymore so they're cheap a  couple hundred bucks
3gmTXDcFJN4,1120799,1126320,then you could have up to four of them  somebody would have to sit there and  switch it it also has audio and it will
3gmTXDcFJN4,1126320,1131840,stream  so you don't need a computer then the  whole thing does itself
3gmTXDcFJN4,1131840,1137200,unfortunately this uh you know it's  about 500 bucks for the mini pro
3gmTXDcFJN4,1137200,1145039,um and then maybe 200 bucks for each  camera so you're still under a thousand  total plus tax
3gmTXDcFJN4,1145039,1151360,yeah i was concerned about uh audio  quality so that's what i was looking at  atem solves this
3gmTXDcFJN4,1151360,1156799,because uh you can have lavalier mics  which you kind of you're gonna want a  lavalier for the pr for the principle
3gmTXDcFJN4,1156799,1162640,and you're gonna want a uh a  wider angle mic that's just aimed at the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1162640,1168000,students so they could pick up the  students they're going to be separately  mic but that's the beauty of the a10  mini it has a
3gmTXDcFJN4,1168000,1173679,has a mixer built into it so  i'm thinking that's what you should  probably look at the zooms you're going
3gmTXDcFJN4,1173679,1180000,to have different audio from each zoom  plus how do you switch cameras  so it's a little
3gmTXDcFJN4,1180000,1186000,little tricky  are you familiar with the open broadcast  software  uh yeah i mean there you could do a lot
3gmTXDcFJN4,1186000,1192960,of this in software but you'd have to be  able to take multiple usb inputs  and then you'd have to mix it and that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,1192960,1198799,actually harder believe it or not  as long as the software can handle  multiple audio and video streams and
3gmTXDcFJN4,1198799,1205039,then mix them down  [Music]  you could do that  this black magic you're recommending how
3gmTXDcFJN4,1205039,1210799,does it connect you know i'm not  familiar with at all how does it connect  to a youtube stream or the internet just
3gmTXDcFJN4,1210799,1217919,with an ethernet jack  or wi-fi  i think it can do wi-fi as well
3gmTXDcFJN4,1217919,1223840,so it's kind of a cool idea because it  becomes that computer  and it's designed to be a switcher you
3gmTXDcFJN4,1223840,1230480,know you can do like like they do and  you know you see in the control room on  the football games is and actually it
3gmTXDcFJN4,1230480,1236240,would be a great choice if you did  school sports and it has some real  growth potential
3gmTXDcFJN4,1236240,1241760,and the nice thing about having hdmi in  is you can use any variety of of camera
3gmTXDcFJN4,1241760,1247280,sources and you can use their audio  individual audio too come to think of it  so i think that's probably the way i
3gmTXDcFJN4,1247280,1253360,would i would at least look at that you  could do it in software but it's always  better doing hardware that was the  advice
3gmTXDcFJN4,1253360,1260840,i was given when i first started  streaming our video  hardware do hardware don't do software
3gmTXDcFJN4,1260840,1267310,blackmagicdesign.com it's called the  atem mini  pro  leo laporte the tech guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,1267310,1274960,[Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,1274960,1281440,yeah and you could control it uh with an  ipad or another computer uh as well  which is kind of nice
3gmTXDcFJN4,1281440,1287600,uh probably you would have to do that to  set up the stream um this these will  stream to
3gmTXDcFJN4,1287600,1293039,gosh you know youtube  facebook  pretty much anything
3gmTXDcFJN4,1293039,1299039,um  there's software that can run an ipad or  a computer that can control it but you
3gmTXDcFJN4,1299039,1304799,also have physical hardware buttons on  there you can have it's got a lot of  advanced uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,1304799,1310960,features too like the ability to uh  do transitions chroma keys you have  green screens
3gmTXDcFJN4,1310960,1317120,um if it's it's the first step in  building a mini production studio which  is kind of cool
3gmTXDcFJN4,1317120,1323039,um  so anyway at 500 bucks it's not cheap  but uh on the other hand given what it
3gmTXDcFJN4,1323039,1328559,does it's incredibly cheap  it's surprisingly cheap
3gmTXDcFJN4,1328559,1335760,yes sir the technology has come a long  way it sure has yeah  if we if they'd had this uh when i was
3gmTXDcFJN4,1335760,1341760,just starting out  uh we might have gone this way instead  of with the tricasters uh but you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,1341760,1349120,this is tricaster gives us more  capabilities but a lot more expensive  i think you want the atem mini pro
3gmTXDcFJN4,1349120,1355360,five it records as well which is nice  so you can stream it but you can also  record it
3gmTXDcFJN4,1355360,1360960,if you get a really good pledge of  allegiance you can uh  you can play it back next time
3gmTXDcFJN4,1360960,1366559,that kind of thing  thank you for the advice hey my pleasure  thank you
3gmTXDcFJN4,1366559,1374799,have a great day take care  the tech guy podcast brought to you  today by wealthfront oh man
3gmTXDcFJN4,1374799,1380080,oh man i'm talking to my son uh henry  he's 27 starting out in life
3gmTXDcFJN4,1380080,1388400,uh  starting to invest  starting to invest  and uh my daughter too little older she
3gmTXDcFJN4,1388400,1394799,uh i remember she asked me should i buy  dogecoin for my investments i said you  know honey
3gmTXDcFJN4,1395760,1401440,henry's all over the other meme stuck  says you know guys  man when i was young i wish somebody
3gmTXDcFJN4,1401440,1407120,told me this  yes it's fun  to play with these fun investments like
3gmTXDcFJN4,1407120,1412640,cryptocurrency or  or meme stocks  and that's fine
3gmTXDcFJN4,1412640,1418080,but  it's not the way to build your wealth
3gmTXDcFJN4,1418080,1424559,okay building your wealth  preparing for your future that first  house your kids college education your
3gmTXDcFJN4,1424559,1431520,retirement all of that  that's a different  beast entirely so stock trading a lot of
3gmTXDcFJN4,1431520,1436799,fun but best enjoyed i guess i should  say in moderation like casino gambling
3gmTXDcFJN4,1436799,1445440,or eating questionable street food  if you're playing the market  fine but understand that's play money
3gmTXDcFJN4,1445440,1453200,for the real wealth building wealth  front  wealth front by the way i'm happy to say  both kids took my advice they listen
3gmTXDcFJN4,1453200,1460159,because you know i want them to take  care of themselves down the road because  i'm not going to be here to do it  wealthfront has a lot of data to show
3gmTXDcFJN4,1460159,1468000,that time in the market and if you're  young you've got 30 40 years before your  retirement you know you got you got time
3gmTXDcFJN4,1468000,1473520,time in the market almost always beats  timing the market and that's the hard  thing about buying a meme stock when do
3gmTXDcFJN4,1473520,1481440,you buy when do you sell when's high  winds low is it going to go up again is  it going to go down again and  cryptocurrency it's even crazier right
3gmTXDcFJN4,1481440,1486960,with wealthfront they've got globally  diversified portfolios they're  automatically optimized to hit the goals
3gmTXDcFJN4,1486960,1492480,you set  and the risk tolerance you have  so you just say look i'm saving up for
3gmTXDcFJN4,1492480,1499440,uh my kids college education that's  probably 30 years off because i'm not  married yet that kind of thing you plan
3gmTXDcFJN4,1499440,1505360,it and they do all sorts of interesting  things they uh give you automatic tax  breaks can boost your returns it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,1505360,1511200,called tax loss harvesting and they  actually wealthfront actually invented  the software that does that they were
3gmTXDcFJN4,1511200,1518080,the first you can also personalize your  portfolio they understand you might want  some customization hand-picked funds
3gmTXDcFJN4,1518080,1523600,picked by wealthfront's financial  experts  and yes that they have cryptocurrency
3gmTXDcFJN4,1523600,1528960,funds  and cannabis funds and clean energy and  social responsibility that's a good way
3gmTXDcFJN4,1528960,1534080,to customize it again with a diversified  portfolio in those
3gmTXDcFJN4,1534080,1540320,realms  much less risky  you know there's always risk but the  idea is we're in it for the long haul
3gmTXDcFJN4,1540320,1548000,here right uh wealth threats trusted now  with 27  billion in assets they've grown and for
3gmTXDcFJN4,1548000,1554640,good reason  nearly half a million people build their  wealth with wealthfront i think that  that makes that warms my heart

3gmTXDcFJN4,1605840,1611279,it's time to talk automotive technology  with our car guy sam ebel samad
3gmTXDcFJN4,1611279,1618320,principal researcher at guide house  insights he also does the wheel bearings  podcast at wheel bearings dot media
3gmTXDcFJN4,1618320,1623360,hello sam  hello leo how are you this week i am  great how are you
3gmTXDcFJN4,1623360,1630480,i'm doing fantastic the weather's been  great here in michigan  nice sun shining beautiful ipsilanti
3gmTXDcFJN4,1630480,1636159,yep it's a beautiful day  miata  a little paddle boarding with the top
3gmTXDcFJN4,1636159,1642559,down  of course that's the story the only way  i drive  if i can't put the top down i'd just
3gmTXDcFJN4,1642559,1647840,take it out of the garage that's exactly  right now you're not sitting in front of  a miata right now on the screen behind
3gmTXDcFJN4,1647840,1653600,you and i could see sam because he's on  on zoom it looks like a truck a ford  truck
3gmTXDcFJN4,1653600,1660080,looks like a big rig actually well it  it's uh it's actually part of the the  front the front portion of the body of a
3gmTXDcFJN4,1660080,1666240,ford explorer this particular case okay  uh but i went over to dearborn a few  days ago
3gmTXDcFJN4,1666240,1672720,where ford has their product development  center and we got to see a new lab that  just opened up a few months ago it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,1672720,1679200,called their ford driving dynamics lab  uh and what we have in here is uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,1679200,1684240,basically a you know a multi-million  dollar gran turismo rig if you will um
3gmTXDcFJN4,1684240,1690480,but it's actually far more sophisticated  than that this is a nine degree of  freedom simulator
3gmTXDcFJN4,1690480,1696720,um and  you know and when when we visited on  thursday i think it was
3gmTXDcFJN4,1696720,1701919,they  it had a buck on there which was the  front portion of an explorer but they
3gmTXDcFJN4,1701919,1707919,can swap that out um in a couple of  hours and put in different ones for  different vehicles uh so that the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1707919,1714720,experience you get in there is  representative of the vehicle they're  working on  uh and this is not actually uh so this
3gmTXDcFJN4,1714720,1719919,is a full motion simulator if you've  ever seen uh like aircraft uh simulators
3gmTXDcFJN4,1719919,1726320,uh where they have the front portion of  an aircraft and it moves around it's on  a bunch of hydraulic jacks and it moves
3gmTXDcFJN4,1726320,1731440,up and down and side to side and around  uh and tips forward and tips back
3gmTXDcFJN4,1731440,1739679,that's basically what we've got here wow  this is like the ultimate gaming rig oh  absolutely um and uh there's a 200 play
3gmTXDcFJN4,1739679,1746159,forza on it that'd be kind of fun  in theory you could  but i don't think they don't no yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,1746159,1753360,they they don't what do they do at night  after hours  you never know  um it is running it is running windows
3gmTXDcFJN4,1753360,1760480,is it wow yeah there's a windows windows  rig that's running this thing uh but  you've got a 270 degree field of view
3gmTXDcFJN4,1760480,1766480,all around you wow  they've got  lcd displays in place of the mirrors so
3gmTXDcFJN4,1766480,1771840,you have the simulated view of your  rearview mirrors when you're driving
3gmTXDcFJN4,1771840,1779120,and it feels remarkably realistic and  they also have sound in there to  simulate the sound and it's funny when
3gmTXDcFJN4,1779120,1784240,when we got to try this thing out um  when i was still working as an engineer
3gmTXDcFJN4,1784240,1792320,back in the late 90s at that company i  worked for at the time uh kelsey hayes  uh we built a uh driver in the loop uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,1792320,1798559,simulator system uh using a silicon  graphics iris machine which you're  familiar with you know this was a
3gmTXDcFJN4,1798559,1806159,multi-hundred thousand dollar machine  that now probably has less power than  our typical smartphone ironic yeah and
3gmTXDcFJN4,1806159,1812960,um the the thing is with that one uh you  know it wasn't a full motion simulator  we had this giant screen a projector and
3gmTXDcFJN4,1812960,1820000,a giant screen in front of us and we had  a buck that we could put the different  um anti-lock and brake contraction
3gmTXDcFJN4,1820000,1826880,control and stability control hardware  into it's got pedals and a steering  wheel and everything and you get in and  drive it to test out the software we
3gmTXDcFJN4,1826880,1833760,were working on but the thing is  it was hard to do it for any length of  time because you didn't have the
3gmTXDcFJN4,1833760,1840399,feedback you had this giant very  immersive screen it would make you  nauseous  it did did it made you very nice you're
3gmTXDcFJN4,1840399,1847440,not moving even though the screen is you  see the motion in front of you uh of  what the vehicle is doing but you're not
3gmTXDcFJN4,1847440,1852880,actually moving and it was it very often  induced motion sickness so does this not
3gmTXDcFJN4,1852880,1859279,does this work better it does not  because the motions your inner ear  agrees with what you're seeing exactly
3gmTXDcFJN4,1859279,1865600,yeah it's very well synced to what  you're seeing wow and what it's used for  they they've actually had a similar one
3gmTXDcFJN4,1865600,1872000,at the ford performance uh development  center in uh north carolina since 2014
3gmTXDcFJN4,1872000,1877600,uh and they also have an older one that  they also have in dearborn that they  call vertex which was originally
3gmTXDcFJN4,1877600,1883279,developed more for doing human factors  testing  so it's not as high fidelity as this one
3gmTXDcFJN4,1883279,1889919,it's it's a motion simulator but it  doesn't it can't replicate road surfaces  and things like that
3gmTXDcFJN4,1889919,1896480,this has enough power and enough speed  that it can very accurately represent or
3gmTXDcFJN4,1896480,1902640,simulate  driving over different kinds of road  surfaces doing different kinds of  maneuvers
3gmTXDcFJN4,1902640,1908399,you feel the  the lateral forces when it you know when  you're turning and it moves from side to
3gmTXDcFJN4,1908399,1914240,side and you feel what you would feel in  the vehicle and the great thing about  this
3gmTXDcFJN4,1914240,1920399,is that uh when they're when they're  doing development uh particularly on  suspension systems they often go through
3gmTXDcFJN4,1920399,1925840,many iterations of trying out different  spring rates different dampers different  tires
3gmTXDcFJN4,1925840,1931760,changing the suspension geometry and  that takes a lot of time and costs a lot  of money to build all the prototype
3gmTXDcFJN4,1931760,1937519,parts and then it know can take many  hours or days in some cases to
3gmTXDcFJN4,1937519,1943600,uh take prototype vehicles and swap out  the parts and then you know go to the  track so you might go to the tr go to a
3gmTXDcFJN4,1943600,1950960,test track for a day or two and take  maybe three or four  different iterations of hardware
3gmTXDcFJN4,1950960,1956320,and they'd go out and drive and gather  data for an hour or two and then come  back into the garage and spend the rest
3gmTXDcFJN4,1956320,1963360,of the day uh changing out parts and  then go back out and drive some more and  that's a costly process it's very costly
3gmTXDcFJN4,1963360,1969840,and very slow whereas with this you can  make those changes instantaneously you  can go through all these different
3gmTXDcFJN4,1969840,1975760,variations tweak the variables and  yeah and they've got they've got road  surfaces that they've gone out and laser
3gmTXDcFJN4,1975760,1980799,scanned so they know you know the exact  contours of the road so they can  replicate all this stuff and it really
3gmTXDcFJN4,1980799,1985919,does feel  like uh like driving a real vehicle um
3gmTXDcFJN4,1985919,1993440,and it was i was i was really impressed  with it um they used this one this  particular lab just opened up in
3gmTXDcFJN4,1993440,1999279,december of last year the existing lab  in north carolina their their for their
3gmTXDcFJN4,1999279,2004640,which was originally developed primarily  for developing their racing programs
3gmTXDcFJN4,2004640,2011279,that one was also used for several  production programs including the maki  the mustang maki and the lightning
3gmTXDcFJN4,2011279,2018000,and the ford maverick  so they did a lot of that work on on the  at that facility before they built
3gmTXDcFJN4,2018000,2024399,prototype vehicles and it really speeds  up the development process i would think  so  you know it's in a way you're riding on
3gmTXDcFJN4,2024399,2029760,a robot that's doing the moves  while the moves on the screen  duplicating the moves on the screen
3gmTXDcFJN4,2029760,2034880,there is a place if people are  interested you can do this  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,2034880,2040159,yourself which is believe it or not the  harry potter ride a universal studios i
3gmTXDcFJN4,2040159,2045760,don't know if you've ever  gone on that but there the reason that  ride works it's a it's a virtual reality
3gmTXDcFJN4,2045760,2052240,sort of ride but you're being held in  your seats by a giant robotic arm
3gmTXDcFJN4,2052240,2060878,a a uh two  i'm sorry 5258 pound  kuka kr 500 robotic arm which moves your
3gmTXDcFJN4,2060878,2066320,seats around  to match the screens and then you move  through the castle so you feel like
3gmTXDcFJN4,2066320,2071358,you're flying it's actually  i've been on it in fact  when i discovered it i went out like
3gmTXDcFJN4,2071358,2077919,five times in a row because i was  fascinated by it and it's very  speculative there's been a number of
3gmTXDcFJN4,2077919,2083839,roller coaster simulators like this over  the years yeah in a lot of places this  thing is used in industry in fact i
3gmTXDcFJN4,2083839,2088960,think tesla uses them to uh to on its uh  assembly line to build cars but
3gmTXDcFJN4,2088960,2094320,uh it also every manufacturer uses these  types of industrial robots yeah yeah and
3gmTXDcFJN4,2094320,2100320,but but those you know these  these robots here  um that you're talking about these move
3gmTXDcFJN4,2100320,2105680,relatively slowly compared to the kinds  of motions were you johnson around like  yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,2105680,2111359,we're driving over over rough roads and  and rumble strips and and it feels like
3gmTXDcFJN4,2111359,2116400,exactly what those types of road  surfaces feel like  and what was really funny was what they
3gmTXDcFJN4,2116400,2123040,didn't tell me when i first got in the  first model they loaded up was for the  maverick um but that the model was did
3gmTXDcFJN4,2123040,2129680,not have the anti-lock brakes enabled  didn't have the abs enabled and i wanted  to see how it would respond under hard
3gmTXDcFJN4,2129680,2134880,braking so i slammed on the brakes oh  dear all of a sudden the back end starts  to swing around
3gmTXDcFJN4,2134880,2140560,counter steering and it felt just like  driving a real car without abs and  hitting the brakes too hard this would
3gmTXDcFJN4,2140560,2147200,be great for training race car drivers  well and that's one of the things that  they do with it at their and and most
3gmTXDcFJN4,2147200,2153920,most of the manufacturers have these  kinds of facilities to do this very cool  sam abu samad our car guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,2153920,2161680,will bearings dot media thank you  a sam  of pleasure leo looks like a great ride
3gmTXDcFJN4,2169040,2174960,that's systemical  yeah i love this harry potter ride i  don't know you say the you say the robot
3gmTXDcFJN4,2174960,2180480,doesn't  move very fast but  honestly i mean it's fast but it's not
3gmTXDcFJN4,2180480,2187040,enough to be fast enough  yeah but not not fast enough to  replicate the kinds of emotions you get
3gmTXDcFJN4,2187040,2193200,bumps frost heaves and potholes i mean  you can simulate all all those sorts of  things with this i went on it and loved
3gmTXDcFJN4,2193200,2198880,it so much i kept going on it lisa said  i'll never go on again it made her  nauseated but you see there's four
3gmTXDcFJN4,2198880,2204240,people in a seat held by each robot the  robot's on a on a track
3gmTXDcFJN4,2204240,2210240,and it's moving around it's really kind  of sophisticated it's kind of amazing  uh what they're doing in these amusement
3gmTXDcFJN4,2210240,2216079,park rides and yeah the um the simpsons  ride which was their first simulated  roller coaster ride is much more like
3gmTXDcFJN4,2216079,2221680,this where you're in a box that's on  actuators like that not a robot arm and
3gmTXDcFJN4,2221680,2228800,going to and that's  joe you know that really  it's terrible i really don't like it
3gmTXDcFJN4,2228800,2234560,yeah to have this kind of fidelity just  to replicate the way did it feel like  you were really dry i mean i guess it
3gmTXDcFJN4,2234560,2240400,did if it spun out on the rear wheels  oh yeah no it it did feel very realistic
3gmTXDcFJN4,2240400,2246240,wow that's cool and as i said that you  know they used it to do suspension  development for maki
3gmTXDcFJN4,2246240,2253119,for the maverick and for the lightning  and now you know they're working on new  programs with this one in dearborn nice
3gmTXDcFJN4,2253119,2258160,yeah  do you want to stick around to this week  or not sure all right
3gmTXDcFJN4,2258160,2263839,i shall give you you don't have anywhere  else to be well that's not a reason to  do it i'll give you control no i mean
3gmTXDcFJN4,2263839,2268960,it's it's i enjoyed doing it i mean the  the only reason i didn't last week  because i i know you were going to be on
3gmTXDcFJN4,2268960,2277359,twit which is very important that's  right i'll give you a little clock there  and you'll all ready so uh let's see web
3gmTXDcFJN4,2277359,2283920,114 asked about the multumaki ever be  back in production actually it's never  gone out of production oh i thought they
3gmTXDcFJN4,2283920,2290320,stopped because of the uh recall  they stopped so they  they they they temporarily stopped
3gmTXDcFJN4,2290320,2298720,delivering new vehicles to customers um  so they're sitting at  those are those were sitting on dealer  lots for a bit um but the they're doing
3gmTXDcFJN4,2298720,2305440,uh an over-the-air software update so  they're still building them ah uh  they're just stockpiling them for a  couple of weeks until they get until
3gmTXDcFJN4,2305440,2310480,they push out the software update yeah  because demand's been good right yeah no  they can't build them fast enough
3gmTXDcFJN4,2310480,2316240,there's lots of demand and there there  is also the question of profitability  which yeah i saw that you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,2316240,2322640,underwater on them  yeah i mean when they launched  production last year they were making  money on it um you know unfortunately
3gmTXDcFJN4,2322640,2330000,the cost of commodities uh like  particularly the uh the battery raw  materials nickel manganese cobalt can't
3gmTXDcFJN4,2330000,2336160,they just raise the price on the thing  you can up to a point um you know but
3gmTXDcFJN4,2336160,2342000,there's  you know and in fact some manufacturers  have done this tesla raised their prices
3gmTXDcFJN4,2342000,2350320,yet again  last week by about two to three thousand  dollars on various models  um and uh gm announced a six thousand
3gmTXDcFJN4,2350320,2356960,dollar price increase on the hummer ev  uh so you know some manufacturers are  raising prices uh and there has been a
3gmTXDcFJN4,2356960,2362480,bit of a price increase on the the  lightning on some models of the  lightning to offset these uh commodity
3gmTXDcFJN4,2362480,2368400,price increases jerry's lightning  arrived at the dealer  oh yeah yeah jerry wagley yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,2368400,2374640,excellent yeah he's excited  i'll bet yeah  so he must have ordered his like right
3gmTXDcFJN4,2374640,2381839,day one um it wasn't that long ago i  feel like a few months ago  uh well maybe he must have gotten his
3gmTXDcFJN4,2381839,2388079,reservation in very early oh he yeah you  know what that's what it was yeah he had  a reservation and then he did the build
3gmTXDcFJN4,2388079,2394320,yep yeah yeah  yeah just like just like you did so nice  uh cool yeah no it's uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,2394320,2402800,i think he's gonna really like it  um  stick around for the top yup okey-dokey
3gmTXDcFJN4,2402800,2410079,lord of mine  feed my temperature rising  so uh professor laura is all excited
3gmTXDcFJN4,2410079,2416240,because she's gonna go see the new elvis  movie professor laura do you even know  who elvis is  uh duh
3gmTXDcFJN4,2416240,2422880,duh she says  that's interesting cause i mean honestly  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,2422880,2428079,you were born long after elvis was even  on this earth he wasn't lilo and stitch
3gmTXDcFJN4,2428079,2435440,come on he was in lilo and stitch oh  that explains it  which song was in lilo and stitch all of
3gmTXDcFJN4,2435440,2441760,them all of them i didn't know that okay  a hunk of hunk of burning stitch
3gmTXDcFJN4,2441760,2449119,so uh yeah the uh that's an interesting  question  laura said during the break are you  gonna go to see this movie i'd love to
3gmTXDcFJN4,2449119,2455440,but i'm not sure i want to sit in a  movie theater  people are people back in the theater  are they going to when you go to the
3gmTXDcFJN4,2455440,2462480,movies laura do you see a lot of people  in the theaters yes you do  john our studio manager rented an entire
3gmTXDcFJN4,2462480,2469040,theater  so we could see dr strange without  strangers  [Laughter]
3gmTXDcFJN4,2469040,2474880,that was fun but i had that's the first  movie i'd seen in a couple of years  honestly i think a lot of us over the
3gmTXDcFJN4,2474880,2481359,intervening two years of the pandemic  have built  you know decent home theaters nice tvs  have gotten better and better and better
3gmTXDcFJN4,2481359,2487520,sound is better and better you can  really  duplicate the movie experience at home i  think in most cases
3gmTXDcFJN4,2487520,2494319,i'm just going to wait  i'm going to wait until it's a  a ride at the universal stu
3gmTXDcFJN4,2494319,2500000,tours studio tours then then i'll do it  as a ride how about that the elvis the  ride
3gmTXDcFJN4,2500000,2506000,michael on the line from cincinnati ohio  hello michael leo laporte the tech guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,2506000,2513680,hey leo um so i think it was yesterday i  listened to your podcast a lot don't  always get to listen to the like
3gmTXDcFJN4,2513680,2520000,um  you were talking about youtube tv and i  kind of panicked when you said you had
3gmTXDcFJN4,2520000,2527280,to reset your account i've been a user  of youtube since it first came out i  have a son in washington dc that's on an
3gmTXDcFJN4,2527280,2534480,internship for 12 weeks i said be  careful i just heard on from the tech  guy that you know if you're logging in
3gmTXDcFJN4,2534480,2539760,from dc they might see that as that  we've moved or whatever and i could lose
3gmTXDcFJN4,2539760,2545359,have to set up a new account and lose  all the recordings that you you talked  about
3gmTXDcFJN4,2545359,2550960,uh i did some digging  and it looks like google maybe put in a
3gmTXDcFJN4,2550960,2557839,fix  with two-factor authentication  at least that's what i could see online
3gmTXDcFJN4,2557839,2563920,but yeah they have rules  about how it works they say you have to
3gmTXDcFJN4,2563920,2571599,check in at your home area at least  every three months  so he's just on the
3gmTXDcFJN4,2571599,2579520,he can watch it that's not their issue  it's just that if you keep watching  youtube tv in a new locale
3gmTXDcFJN4,2579520,2585440,after three months they're gonna say oh  you moved  okay every month yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,2585440,2591040,i think you have a little leeway on that  so uh i think he'll be all right i think
3gmTXDcFJN4,2591040,2596720,so that's exactly three months he's  going to be gone  yeah it is it's 12 weeks so yeah three
3gmTXDcFJN4,2596720,2603520,months i wasn't sure i mean so certainly  when he logs in i'm getting  notifications i think you might even be
3gmTXDcFJN4,2603520,2610800,okay because you're going to continue to  watch it in your home  right so  you know youtube tv is very generous
3gmTXDcFJN4,2610800,2617040,they say you can watch it on three  devices at the same time you can have  family members watch it blah blah blah
3gmTXDcFJN4,2617040,2622720,um i wonder and that that was the other  thing i saw that you could i saw on
3gmTXDcFJN4,2622720,2628880,there and they said yeah you can set up  a family  member out of state as a group or
3gmTXDcFJN4,2628880,2634400,something i hadn't dug into that  so  they i believe have changed
3gmTXDcFJN4,2634400,2639920,their tune you have to be in the same  area code  okay okay
3gmTXDcFJN4,2639920,2646000,so yes you can have somebody who doesn't  live with you  um this has always been you know a
3gmTXDcFJN4,2646000,2652319,loophole for other  services like netflix  where netflix says you're buying a  family plan you can share with your
3gmTXDcFJN4,2652319,2659280,household well what's my household mean  does that mean my daughter who lives in  you know another county
3gmTXDcFJN4,2659280,2665359,uh  she's kind of part of my household i  don't know so and  of course netflix is starting to crack
3gmTXDcFJN4,2665359,2671520,down on that uh and youtube is even  more sophisticated family and so they
3gmTXDcFJN4,2671520,2677920,said yeah  well he is my son so yeah exactly but  now they're saying all members must live
3gmTXDcFJN4,2677920,2683920,in the same area code  okay  um
3gmTXDcFJN4,2683920,2689200,that's tricky too because a lot of  cities now bay area has like three area  codes
3gmTXDcFJN4,2689200,2695119,right uh and frankly my phone might have  a different thanks to cell phones  different area code for my wife so we
3gmTXDcFJN4,2695119,2700880,live in the same house  but uh i have a 302 number because i  have a vanity number
3gmTXDcFJN4,2700880,2708079,so that may be by the way why youtube tv  decided i don't live here because i have  an area code that's in baltimore
3gmTXDcFJN4,2708079,2713440,uh i  we think it was just uh badly done  geolocation
3gmTXDcFJN4,2713440,2719040,but we don't know  maybe yeah well i wasn't using a vpn but
3gmTXDcFJN4,2719040,2724960,uh but it may be that the  uh you know we have not it's complicated  i don't even know how it works because
3gmTXDcFJN4,2724960,2731040,we have a very smart i.t guy but we  obviously have a lot of layers of  security here right and it may well be
3gmTXDcFJN4,2731040,2736800,that the ip address youtube tv was  getting at work  was in wilkes bar pennsylvania i don't
3gmTXDcFJN4,2736800,2743440,know why that would be but maybe  geolocation is an imperfect science and  they decided my ip address belonged to
3gmTXDcFJN4,2743440,2749760,pennsylvania and after three months i  might add  uh with some warnings which i ignored
3gmTXDcFJN4,2749760,2755520,uh because i you know i was at work and  i couldn't really i didn't have the time  to read the screen with some warnings
3gmTXDcFJN4,2755520,2763599,eventually they said oh no you've just  moved you're in pennsylvania now enjoy  your local pennsylvania tv stations
3gmTXDcFJN4,2763599,2769920,uh so yeah but they understood when i  called they were they gave me no trouble  it just said we don't have a way to  reset your local
3gmTXDcFJN4,2769920,2774960,uh  uh address so you have to  and i didn't lose any recordings so
3gmTXDcFJN4,2774960,2781440,here's the worst case scenario your son  watches it you watch it  at some point they will warn you i think
3gmTXDcFJN4,2781440,2788400,before they do anything and at that  point you can tell your son okay  no more tv watch the issue is the locals
3gmTXDcFJN4,2788400,2794560,i should point out by the way  uh because they have a deal with the  local tv stations in your area in my
3gmTXDcFJN4,2794560,2800960,area and if you're watching in another  area now you're watching local tv  another area and that breaks their
3gmTXDcFJN4,2800960,2808240,covenants with these  channels  right and yeah i certainly want the  locals here in cincinnati so all right
3gmTXDcFJN4,2808240,2814560,so you think i'm just i just got to keep  an eye on it just keep an eye and tell  your son if you get a warning
3gmTXDcFJN4,2814560,2821119,stop  if it says hey congratulations on moving  we're going to reset if you you get
3gmTXDcFJN4,2821119,2826960,three or four chances  uh to change your locale i already  warned him because it comes when i was
3gmTXDcFJN4,2826960,2832240,in the pod or so yesterday yeah like  panic that's like stop yeah so you you
3gmTXDcFJN4,2832240,2837520,did the smart thing which you went and  you read all of the you know their  advices
3gmTXDcFJN4,2837520,2845040,but the system isn't perfect i guess  that's what i experienced is something  screwed up because at no point did we  ever watch tv in pennsylvania
3gmTXDcFJN4,2845040,2851680,right it was always within two a two  mile radius of my home but they will  they will see that he's in dc watching
3gmTXDcFJN4,2851680,2857200,tv  as long as i'm watching here for three  months but after three months that might
3gmTXDcFJN4,2857200,2863920,be that might be an issue and but like i  said you'll get plenty warning so you  can at that point say hey son
3gmTXDcFJN4,2863920,2869119,how about you get your own youtube  is he going to school in dc what's going  on
3gmTXDcFJN4,2869119,2876559,well he got an internship you know you  know i hate to say it he watched house  of cards oh no he wants
3gmTXDcFJN4,2876559,2881839,yeah  yeah  and he still wanted to go want to go  into politics which i was against he
3gmTXDcFJN4,2881839,2888400,goes to uc but you know he got an n 12  12-week internship out there wow that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,2888400,2894960,great where's he going to be working  he does well we don't know there could  be a job after this we're not sure he's
3gmTXDcFJN4,2894960,2900160,not crazy about dc but we'll see  if you want to be in politics that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,2900160,2905920,ground zero you gotta go there  that's why i tell him man if you wanna  do this this is the point has he been
3gmTXDcFJN4,2905920,2911440,there before  no oh okay  wait till he gets there he's been away
3gmTXDcFJN4,2911440,2917359,from home you're never getting him back  because  there's something about being there
3gmTXDcFJN4,2917359,2922800,the energy of it you know that you are  in  the nation's capital you know it you
3gmTXDcFJN4,2922800,2929280,feel it every street  it's very potent  and uh and it's addictive i hate to say
3gmTXDcFJN4,2929280,2935040,it but it's addictive right i mean  again  out the cards right that's the cards if
3gmTXDcFJN4,2935040,2941200,that didn't scare them off nothing will  i know  that's not serious just stay away from
3gmTXDcFJN4,2941200,2946880,subway platforms you'll be okay  wow  exactly
3gmTXDcFJN4,2946880,2952640,texas means somebody just got shot you  know  i was like tell him to watch west wing
3gmTXDcFJN4,2952640,2958240,watch the first four uh seasons of west  wing he'll have a much uh happier uh  point of view
3gmTXDcFJN4,2958240,2964640,yeah all right that's a very inspiring  show for politics hey a pleasure talking  to you have i'm good congratulations on
3gmTXDcFJN4,2964640,2971839,your son's success that's good and i  think you'll be all right michael leo  laporte the tech guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,2974559,2979600,yeah watch west wing that's a much more  positive  spin on uh on government
3gmTXDcFJN4,2979600,2986720,[Music]  i don't think house of cards is really i  hope it's not what it's really like uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,2986720,2993040,great show but  all right sammy as you can see
3gmTXDcFJN4,2993040,2998559,you are in charge  all right  uh so let's see going back here in the
3gmTXDcFJN4,2998559,3003839,chat uh  phoenix warp i think yeah phoenix warp  was asking but i guess he's got a jeep
3gmTXDcFJN4,3003839,3010559,wrangler right now says his jeep hasn't  produced an electric jeep  after uh after his current wrangler he's
3gmTXDcFJN4,3010559,3016800,really gonna start thinking about the  mock e  well the good news uh such as it is is
3gmTXDcFJN4,3016800,3022240,that jeep has promised to introduce  battery electric versions of
3gmTXDcFJN4,3022240,3027599,vehicles in every product segment it's  in  by 2025
3gmTXDcFJN4,3027599,3033599,and an electric wrangler is probably  going to launch in 2024
3gmTXDcFJN4,3033599,3039200,so if you can hold out for another two  years  in fact we may even see something later
3gmTXDcFJN4,3039200,3044640,this year i know uh  stalantis jeep's parent company is going
3gmTXDcFJN4,3044640,3050160,to be showing off some concept versions  of some of its upcoming evs
3gmTXDcFJN4,3050160,3055920,in august uh including their promised  dodge e-muscle car
3gmTXDcFJN4,3055920,3061920,that's going to be revealed in august  and  we'll see some other stuff as well
3gmTXDcFJN4,3061920,3067599,coming in in august and and through the  fall  in fact i wouldn't be surprised if they
3gmTXDcFJN4,3067599,3074800,use the detroit auto show which is  coming back in september as the launch  event to show us to give us a preview of
3gmTXDcFJN4,3074800,3080480,the upcoming ram 1500 ev their full-size  pickup truck but the wrangler
3gmTXDcFJN4,3080480,3086960,is probably from what i've been hearing  probably going to launch in 24. uh  jeep's first ev is going to be launching
3gmTXDcFJN4,3086960,3093520,early next year uh compact crossover  that's going to be launching in europe  first um
3gmTXDcFJN4,3093520,3100079,and then over the next couple of years  we'll see electric versions of all the  other jeeps coming uh so that's that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,3100079,3106240,on its way um and then what else oh uh  somebody asked for um
3gmTXDcFJN4,3106240,3111520,was web  0114  asked about the vw id buzz wanted an
3gmTXDcFJN4,3111520,3116800,update on that so uh the buzz is uh i  think it's i think it has started
3gmTXDcFJN4,3116800,3123839,production uh or if not it will be very  momentarily um with uh the first uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3123839,3129680,version of it the shorter wheelbase  version of it going on sale in europe  they have started taking orders for the
3gmTXDcFJN4,3129680,3135520,id buzz uh in europe and those  deliveries will probably start uh late
3gmTXDcFJN4,3135520,3140880,summer early fall in europe  but the  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3140880,3148079,for the u.s market we're only we're  getting a longer wheelbase version so  it'll look basically the same just a  little bit longer uh and that'll be a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3148079,3153680,three row van as opposed to the two row  that they are selling in europe right  now
3gmTXDcFJN4,3153680,3160720,that one is not coming here until early  2024. uh they will open the order books  for that probably sometime next year uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3160720,3166160,but it's it's going to be about another  year and a half a little more than a  year and a half before we start to see
3gmTXDcFJN4,3166160,3171839,those delivered here in north america  um  and then uh see
3gmTXDcFJN4,3171839,3177839,um  somebody commented about uh oz james uh  commented but musk saying tesla is
3gmTXDcFJN4,3177839,3184960,bleeding money yeah what uh what elon  was referring to  uh in the recent months tesla has opened
3gmTXDcFJN4,3184960,3192240,two new assembly plants  um and uh unfortunately neither one of  them is making vehicles in any notable
3gmTXDcFJN4,3192240,3197359,quantity yet  they they  started this started construction on
3gmTXDcFJN4,3197359,3204160,these assembly plants with the  assumption that they were going to be  building  versions of some of their products like
3gmTXDcFJN4,3204160,3211599,the model y and the model 3  based on new technologies particularly  around the batteries uh which is that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,3211599,3216880,that's turning out to be the the main  issue here  um the  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3216880,3224640,the technology that they promised at  their battery day event in 2020  has not come to pass yet it's it's not
3gmTXDcFJN4,3224640,3232960,it's not ready for prime time um they  showed off um  a new type of cylindrical cell um it's a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3232960,3239440,new form factor it's a larger cylinder  cell  called a 4680 and when you're talking
3gmTXDcFJN4,3239440,3245680,about cylindrical battery cells the  numbers refer to  the size of the cell so the first two
3gmTXDcFJN4,3245680,3251520,digits are the diameter in millimeters  and the second two digits are the length
3gmTXDcFJN4,3251520,3258240,in millimeters so the original  um  batteries that tesla used were the 18650
3gmTXDcFJN4,3258240,3264160,cell so those are 18 millimeters in  diameter by 65 millimeters long  when they introduced the model 3 they
3gmTXDcFJN4,3264160,3269520,switched to a 2170 which is 21  millimeters in diameter 70 millimeters  long so a little a little fatter a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3269520,3274880,little longer the new cells are 46.80  so they're more than twice as thick in
3gmTXDcFJN4,3274880,3281440,diameter  and a little bit longer  and  one of the reasons why they're going to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3281440,3286720,these larger cells  is that uh if you were to look at yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,3286720,3293520,and this is  the same reasoning why um apple started  uh eliminating removable batteries from
3gmTXDcFJN4,3293520,3299520,their laptops  and from from the iphone as well  because when you have a removable
3gmTXDcFJN4,3299520,3305200,battery  there's a case that has to go around the  battery cell and there's also structure
3gmTXDcFJN4,3305200,3311599,that has to go inside of whatever that  battery is is powering uh to support  that that
3gmTXDcFJN4,3311599,3317760,the the the battery  and  if you eliminate that you can just put a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3317760,3326000,bare cell inside the device and so you  can make the cell larger within the same  volume um in the inside the the device
3gmTXDcFJN4,3326000,3331760,so the the same thing is true with ev  batteries  what you want to do is you want to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3331760,3337200,maximize the volume of the active  material in the cells so when you have
3gmTXDcFJN4,3337200,3343520,very small cells like 18 650s or 2170s  every one of those cells has a metal can
3gmTXDcFJN4,3343520,3350400,around the the active material that is  actually inside the battery that's  holding energy and if you
3gmTXDcFJN4,3350400,3356160,make that can larger  you have a larger ratio of the active
3gmTXDcFJN4,3356160,3361599,material to the the can the structure of  the battery of the cell
3gmTXDcFJN4,3361599,3367040,and  so  by going to larger format cells and this  is why most other manufacturers are
3gmTXDcFJN4,3367040,3374000,already using significantly larger cells  even than what tesla uses  because the you can get a larger volume
3gmTXDcFJN4,3374000,3379920,of the active cell material within that  battery uh and so tesla wanted to use
3gmTXDcFJN4,3379920,3384960,these larger 4680 cells but the thing is  what they didn't do is they didn't just
3gmTXDcFJN4,3384960,3391200,make a larger cell the same basic design  but just scale it up they also changed a  bunch of other things or were are trying
3gmTXDcFJN4,3391200,3396400,to change a bunch of other things they  want to go to something called a tables  cell and i'm not going to get into a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3396400,3402160,full explanation of all that right now  but basically the idea is you can get  better
3gmTXDcFJN4,3402160,3408160,if you can do that you can get better  thermal heat dissipation dissipation  from the cell it should be able to last
3gmTXDcFJN4,3408160,3413599,longer  and they're also trying wanted to try a  different manufacturing process called a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3413599,3419520,dry coating process so the electrodes  and  the uh the the cathodes and the anodes
3gmTXDcFJN4,3419520,3428160,in the cell the way they're made today  they coat the uh either copper or  aluminum foil with um a a slurry a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3428160,3434559,basically like a mud of the active  materials the nickel manganese cobalt  aluminum whatever whatever's in there
3gmTXDcFJN4,3434559,3440400,and the lithium they coat that onto the  the current collectors this copper foil
3gmTXDcFJN4,3440400,3446480,um and then it's got to dry out and they  roll it up and what tesla wanted to do  was do a dry coating process so they
3gmTXDcFJN4,3446480,3452480,don't have to they can skip the drying  of that coating  but they have not been able to actually
3gmTXDcFJN4,3452480,3459040,get that manufacturing process to scale  up they've made  they've say about a million of those
3gmTXDcFJN4,3459040,3465680,but when you're talking about 400  or 600 to 700 cells per battery pack per
3gmTXDcFJN4,3465680,3472079,vehicle  um a million only amounts to enough for  about 1500 cars and so you know there's
3gmTXDcFJN4,3472079,3478240,still very early pilot production on  those no they're not mass producing  those cells yet so that brings us back
3gmTXDcFJN4,3478240,3484240,around to  musk's comments about those factories  burning money he built two factories
3gmTXDcFJN4,3484240,3490799,assuming that they were going to have  these batteries ready they don't have  the batteries ready they don't have  enough battery production capacity to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3490799,3496480,support  another half a million units of vehicle  production  and so
3gmTXDcFJN4,3496480,3502559,they can't build cars so they've got  factories that they're paying for that  are costing them money and the one thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,3502559,3508799,you don't want in manufacturing is  unused production capacity because  that's a very fast way to turn large
3gmTXDcFJN4,3508799,3515200,amounts of money into ash that's what  elon's suffering right now isn't it yeah  exactly
3gmTXDcFJN4,3515200,3520799,and so  until they can get their battery  production issues sorted out with these
3gmTXDcFJN4,3520799,3526240,larger cells those plants are not going  to be able to turn out any significant  number of vehicles and they're going to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3526240,3533359,be losing a ton of money on those and  question big question now we're going to  have to wait and see uh in july when
3gmTXDcFJN4,3533359,3539440,they have their their second quarter uh  financial report just how much money  they're actually losing warned they're
3gmTXDcFJN4,3539440,3544799,on the edge of bankruptcy which seems a  strange thing for yeah but he's the ceo  say well yeah that's a dumb thing to say
3gmTXDcFJN4,3544799,3550720,i mean especially yeah well also  they you know they have uh the last
3gmTXDcFJN4,3550720,3555760,quarter they had 15 billion dollars in  cash reserves i know so i don't think  they're quite on the verge but if it
3gmTXDcFJN4,3555760,3564799,goes on why would he say several  quarters it might be  thank you sam  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,3564799,3570720,well hey hey hey how are you today leo  laporte here the tech guy time to talk  computers
3gmTXDcFJN4,3570720,3578000,the internet home theater digital  photography smartphone smart watches  all that jazz 88 88
3gmTXDcFJN4,3578000,3583920,ask leo is the phone number eight eight  eight two seven five five three six toll  free from anywhere in the us
3gmTXDcFJN4,3583920,3589520,or canada outside that area you could  still call just use skype out to reach  us it's toll-free so it shouldn't cost
3gmTXDcFJN4,3589520,3592000,you anything
3gmTXDcFJN4,3599280,3606160,exactly 888-827-5536 her problem was she  says  that her windows due to the windows 10
3gmTXDcFJN4,3606160,3613680,forced update  i'm not sure what that means  she can't use some of her adobe products
3gmTXDcFJN4,3613680,3619440,not sure why  so this is why we want you to be on the  air so we can have a little dialogue you
3gmTXDcFJN4,3619440,3625359,would be  about what's going on windows 10 forced  update no such thing you can be on
3gmTXDcFJN4,3625359,3630720,windows 10 and will not be forced to  update until 2025 unless
3gmTXDcFJN4,3630720,3636559,and i suspect this is what she's talking  about you're using an older version of  windows 10. this is something microsoft
3gmTXDcFJN4,3636559,3643359,does that i'm not sure i really  uh appreciate it maybe they're doing it  in the world of uh you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,3643359,3648799,rocky security they've got to do  something  but  in the old days they'd say well you got
3gmTXDcFJN4,3648799,3654839,you know windows 8. that's going to be  good for this many years usually 10  after that we're not going to support it
3gmTXDcFJN4,3654839,3660000,anymore but what they're saying today  with windows 10 is
3gmTXDcFJN4,3660000,3665040,if you have windows 10  let's say  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3665040,3671119,20  the the 2019
3gmTXDcFJN4,3671119,3676559,spring version which is 1904 because  four is april right
3gmTXDcFJN4,3676559,3683680,uh  you are out of date you are insecure  that isn't windows 10 anymore that's the
3gmTXDcFJN4,3683680,3690640,old windows 10 and you need to update it  and i guess you know it's reached what
3gmTXDcFJN4,3690640,3697359,they call the end of life  so
3gmTXDcFJN4,3697359,3703280,maybe that's what you're talking about  which is that microsoft's saying well  you know uh you got update
3gmTXDcFJN4,3703280,3711119,and i guess there are some machines with  1904  uh or 1909 or even
3gmTXDcFJN4,3711119,3716319,2004 they can't update  because of you know some incompatibility
3gmTXDcFJN4,3716319,3721599,and if that's the case yeah you you  might be kind of  you might be kind of out of luck
3gmTXDcFJN4,3721599,3728160,because uh  now you have a version of windows that  is not updatable and if software
3gmTXDcFJN4,3728160,3733440,manufacturers say oh  uh you have to have
3gmTXDcFJN4,3733440,3739359,version you know  2008 or 20 now the latest version  current version is
3gmTXDcFJN4,3739359,3744480,21 h2 the second half of 2021 that's so  confusing i know
3gmTXDcFJN4,3744480,3749920,although uh 2022 h2 22 h2
3gmTXDcFJN4,3749920,3755520,is currently in beta testing you can  even get it if you want to be a windows  insider
3gmTXDcFJN4,3755520,3761039,and that will soon be out  so  what have i done to conf i've just
3gmTXDcFJN4,3761039,3767359,confused this haven't i  partly my confusion is i'm not sure what  her issue was but i did want to respond
3gmTXDcFJN4,3767359,3772720,to that it is a big problem  uh  if you have a version of windows 10 that
3gmTXDcFJN4,3772720,3779599,you cannot update past say 20 1904  or 2004.
3gmTXDcFJN4,3779599,3785520,uh 20 oh let's see oh these numbers  drive me crazy 2020
3gmTXDcFJN4,3785520,3792400,spring 2020 which is 2004 2004.  sounds like windows 2004 it's not it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,3792400,3797839,it's windows 10 2004.  um if you can't get past that yeah maybe
3gmTXDcFJN4,3797839,3805039,software will no longer work  what do you do nothing  get a new computer that's what irks me
3gmTXDcFJN4,3805039,3812160,here's a computer it's only two years  old  or well must be more than that but it's  old enough uh but it's running a
3gmTXDcFJN4,3812160,3818400,two-year-old operating system and they  and and  companies are saying well that's not  good enough
3gmTXDcFJN4,3819920,3826880,the chair i'm saying this is authentic  tech guy gibberish don't blame me  i didn't make this up
3gmTXDcFJN4,3826880,3834640,it's microsoft's fault 80  i uh it's clear as mud i'm sorry i  haven't helped at all have i
3gmTXDcFJN4,3834640,3840400,uh  update if you can if you can't update  sometimes you can reinstall windows and
3gmTXDcFJN4,3840400,3845680,you can get it updated but if really  microsoft's saying no no there's  something about your hardware that means
3gmTXDcFJN4,3845680,3851760,i can't update you need to get a new  computer those are your choices it's  pretty it's pretty clear-cut
3gmTXDcFJN4,3851760,3858000,john in moore park leo laporte the tech  guy hi john  [Music]  mr john
3gmTXDcFJN4,3858000,3866160,uh yes this is you welcome  hi this is john uh i'm in moorpark i
3gmTXDcFJN4,3866160,3871680,have a question about windows  uh windows 11. i keep getting invited to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3871680,3877760,become a member last time  here's an invitation  [Laughter]
3gmTXDcFJN4,3877760,3884000,yeah they want you to use windows 11.  you don't have to  you can say no
3gmTXDcFJN4,3884000,3890319,uh  [Music]  six months ago you you suggested hold  off i just wondered what's your current
3gmTXDcFJN4,3890319,3896559,position on that oh that's a good  question i see no reason now not to get  windows 11.
3gmTXDcFJN4,3896559,3902720,all right i'll i'll order it this month  you shouldn't have to pay for it do you  have windows 10
3gmTXDcFJN4,3902720,3908400,i have windows yeah i bought a microsoft  computer about two and a half years ago
3gmTXDcFJN4,3908400,3914480,uh  and uh so you have 10 on your computer  11 is a free update
3gmTXDcFJN4,3914480,3919760,so i i'm yeah i've got everything i need  i just figured well you said to hold off
3gmTXDcFJN4,3919760,3924880,slides yeah it's always a good idea when  a new operating system comes out to not  rush
3gmTXDcFJN4,3924880,3930960,to jump on but i think there are no  issues with eleven honestly there's also  not much different with eleven it looks
3gmTXDcFJN4,3930960,3937359,different some people that will will  find that disconcerting the  the kind of the new look but it's close
3gmTXDcFJN4,3937359,3942960,enough i see no reason not to and if  you've got if you've tired  of the uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,3942960,3948400,of the warnings from microsoft you  better get it you better get it  go ahead and get it it's fine to do that
3gmTXDcFJN4,3948400,3954799,i'll just go ahead and get it i've gotta  go ahead and get it off 365. i've got  all of that junk oh yeah you're all in
3gmTXDcFJN4,3954799,3960000,i'll get it in july yeah and it'll be it  should be an easy upgrade uh if anything
3gmTXDcFJN4,3960000,3965760,doesn't work it should also be an easy  return to windows 10 they make that you  have two weeks to do that to make it
3gmTXDcFJN4,3965760,3971920,pretty easy for you so i don't see any  reason to hold off anymore it's been  long enough now that all the rough edges
3gmTXDcFJN4,3971920,3977359,are smoothed off sanded down  all right leo thank you thanks good
3gmTXDcFJN4,3977359,3984079,question thank you john i appreciate it  roy mystic connecticut  hi leo how are you i'm going to be out
3gmTXDcFJN4,3984079,3990400,your way in a bit in fact i was thinking  about 32 miles i guess from your mom i  was thinking of taking my daughter up to
3gmTXDcFJN4,3990400,3996000,the old mystic seaport is that still  around that's three miles away i love  that
3gmTXDcFJN4,3996000,4002799,we used to go there when i was a kid  they got the whaling boats yeah because  you were from rhode island right that's  right grew up in rhode island old swamp
3gmTXDcFJN4,4002799,4007839,yankee right swamp yankee that's what my  mom called me
3gmTXDcFJN4,4007920,4014400,uh wonderful wonderful well maybe we'll  come up and visit old mystic that's  great what can i do for you well leo i
3gmTXDcFJN4,4014400,4019760,got a problem it's not computer related  so much as  i've had a yahoo
3gmTXDcFJN4,4019760,4024960,email account for about 25 years wow  and uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,4024960,4031280,about three months ago somebody hacked  into it oh yeah this is a big problem  with yahoo okay so anyway they turned
3gmTXDcFJN4,4031280,4036880,around and they fixed it  however yeah  they want me to use a secondary password
3gmTXDcFJN4,4036880,4044559,which is a phone number that i haven't  had in 15 years i and they don't want to  talk to me i can't go hey
3gmTXDcFJN4,4044640,4050640,hi  so  so they're saying in order to keep using
3gmTXDcFJN4,4050640,4056079,your yahoo mail yeah you need to verify  that you are who you say you are through
3gmTXDcFJN4,4056079,4061359,a phone number you no longer have  exactly oh yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,4061440,4067520,i don't know how to i don't know how to  get around that  um especially you know it's a they've
3gmTXDcFJN4,4067520,4073520,been sold twice  um  you know i don't even know who owns
3gmTXDcFJN4,4073520,4079760,yahoo mail these days uh was i think was  verizon for a while i don't know it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,4079760,4086640,it's very confusing and obviously  whoever owns it doesn't really care  about it anymore
3gmTXDcFJN4,4086640,4092240,yeah um i had i talked to eva i went on  the uh pay-per-view thing you know and
3gmTXDcFJN4,4092240,4098640,talked to them yeah they said no i have  nothing we can do okay well this is you  know it's like
3gmTXDcFJN4,4098640,4106159,five years let's see uh is it verizon  now  it's yeah i i don't know it's very crazy
3gmTXDcFJN4,4106159,4112400,um  so  yeah i don't know what you can do the  problem of course is
3gmTXDcFJN4,4112400,4118798,that everybody knows your email address  as yahoo oh yeah  sending me emails and i got about 10 000
3gmTXDcFJN4,4118798,4125040,of them by now  uh oh you you can't even log in to get  your old email okay that's terrible
3gmTXDcFJN4,4125040,4130159,yeah  they're this they've been notoriously  insecure for a while i mean i guess at
3gmTXDcFJN4,4130159,4136000,this point what i would suggest is get a  new email provider  i do have one but it doesn't help me
3gmTXDcFJN4,4136000,4141278,with the only well what you have to do  is email everybody you can you know and  say
3gmTXDcFJN4,4141278,4147278,this is what happened and can you if you  sent me email in the last six months i  don't have it yeah because i have some
3gmTXDcFJN4,4147278,4152798,tutorials from years ago you know oh  shoot and uh you know you're the last
3gmTXDcFJN4,4152798,4158719,resort leo i have you know i have no  special  input with yahoo like i said i don't
3gmTXDcFJN4,4158719,4163758,even know who i would call anymore  i can't figure out who owns them
3gmTXDcFJN4,4163758,4169838,um  because you know yahoo was sold for  parts  and so different people own different
3gmTXDcFJN4,4169838,4175120,parts  uh let's see yahoo mail became
3gmTXDcFJN4,4175120,4180798,the business of  you know even apparently even wikipedia  doesn't know who owns them
3gmTXDcFJN4,4180798,4186719,i can't i can't get any information here  uh  so
3gmTXDcFJN4,4186719,4193359,and so i don't even know who you would  who you would call it's it's basically  you were to have to move soon anyway
3gmTXDcFJN4,4193359,4199520,because i really think they're falling  apart and just the wheels are coming off  yeah well at least if i could get in to
3gmTXDcFJN4,4199520,4204560,get my old ones you know that would have  been okay you know they're they're owned  by mike b in the chat room who's
3gmTXDcFJN4,4204560,4210960,generally right says they're owned by  apollo global management  [Laughter]
3gmTXDcFJN4,4210960,4216080,90 apollo global management 10 verizon
3gmTXDcFJN4,4216080,4222560,i guess you know you might try i mean  good luck this is even worse but you  might try calling verizon just to see if
3gmTXDcFJN4,4222560,4228239,maybe they do they own 10  it's just a mess it's just a mess i'm
3gmTXDcFJN4,4228239,4235120,sorry i think there is no fix for this  that's  you know and the only advice in in the  future is keep your uh secondary phone
3gmTXDcFJN4,4235120,4240400,number up to date yeah well you know  it's been so many years you know and i  had it and i know
3gmTXDcFJN4,4240400,4246320,but things go wrong and so i know it is  a really good idea you know if you've  got a gmail account do the same thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,4246320,4252560,it's good idea to have that phone number  for sure  for backup you know they call it  recovery phone number yeah but make sure
3gmTXDcFJN4,4252560,4260000,it's up to date and see they never asked  me for it before oh right except you  know my password works and my
3gmTXDcFJN4,4260000,4265600,you know username and then they said oh  you got to log into this other phone
3gmTXDcFJN4,4265600,4271120,number right  i don't have it anymore ah that's  because  they've been hacked so many times at
3gmTXDcFJN4,4271120,4276159,this point they don't know who's who  so  i think i think you just have to write
3gmTXDcFJN4,4276159,4282640,off the mail that's in that inbox you  have to send email to everybody you know  from your new email account
3gmTXDcFJN4,4282640,4289040,saying  hey look this is what happened if you  sent me email in the last six months  sorry i didn't get it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4289040,4295360,try again  if it's important they'll send it again  i'm sorry i really apologize uh but
3gmTXDcFJN4,4295360,4300719,this is what happens when a company just  slowly  declines we haven't had to deal with
3gmTXDcFJN4,4300719,4306800,this this is all new right technology's  new  but we're going to start dealing with it  more and more as these companies
3gmTXDcFJN4,4306800,4313440,you know fall apart get sold get sold  again get sold again  apollo global management what do they
3gmTXDcFJN4,4313440,4319600,care right  why do they even buy it  probably they don't care about yahoo
3gmTXDcFJN4,4319600,4325360,mail that's just a cost center for them  they make no money on it  probably they care about
3gmTXDcFJN4,4325360,4330560,the name intellectual property rights  something  maybe they're going to put out a yahoo
3gmTXDcFJN4,4330560,4337040,television or a yahoo lawnmower i don't  know  they don't care about the mail
3gmTXDcFJN4,4337440,4343040,sy  88.88 ask leo i've been getting a lot of  calls lately about yahoo mail aol and
3gmTXDcFJN4,4343040,4349120,yahoo mail because uh you know people  don't change and then  stuff decays
3gmTXDcFJN4,4349120,4355840,leo laporte the tech guy  hey line dog in our chat had this crazy  idea it's a long shot for our last
3gmTXDcFJN4,4355840,4361360,caller  but you know your old phone number  somebody else by now has it call it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4361360,4367440,say hey dude  [Laughter]  this is crazy
3gmTXDcFJN4,4367440,4374159,but  call me maybe no you say hey dude i know  this is crazy but i need to get account
3gmTXDcFJN4,4374159,4381360,my account access to my yahoo account  just once because i'll change the phone  number the minute i do
3gmTXDcFJN4,4381360,4387679,could i have yahoo send you a text  and you would tell me the number
3gmTXDcFJN4,4387679,4393600,and then i will be able to log into my  yahoo mail account now  if i am the guy with
3gmTXDcFJN4,4393600,4398960,your old number i'm going to say yeah  right nice try  scammer
3gmTXDcFJN4,4398960,4404400,i'm going to assume that that's a  phishing attack  against me  but
3gmTXDcFJN4,4404400,4411360,maybe you can be persuasive  so because doesn't that sound like a  fishing call yeah uh hello
3gmTXDcFJN4,4411360,4417520,you don't know me  call me crazy  but uh could you just tell me what uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,4417520,4423360,yahoo just texted you  yeah i wouldn't do that myself but give  it a try
3gmTXDcFJN4,4423360,4429920,give it a try  it was a good clever idea elon dog i  like it i never i didn't think of that
3gmTXDcFJN4,4429920,4436480,somebody probably has that number by now  right janet san diego leo laporte the e  tech guy hi janet
3gmTXDcFJN4,4436480,4442000,hi  hello  i'm the person who wasn't able to speak  before um and i'm kind of new to
3gmTXDcFJN4,4442000,4448719,speaking oh you're the one with the  windows 11 issue oh good well windows 10  windows 10 and the version of windows is
3gmTXDcFJN4,4448719,4455120,two on h1 so i don't know if that's no  that's not a problem so when you say the  kim told me you said
3gmTXDcFJN4,4455120,4461760,there's a problem with the windows 10  forced update but i'm not sure what that  means can you clarify
3gmTXDcFJN4,4461760,4466800,yes so um the schedule that i have with  updates
3gmTXDcFJN4,4466800,4472080,sometimes seems to be overridden by them  and this primarily has to do with  premiere pro
3gmTXDcFJN4,4472080,4478400,and this happened also about two months  ago um sometimes there'll be updates i'm  not expecting in the middle of the night
3gmTXDcFJN4,4478400,4485199,with windows and all of a sudden they  won't be able to even access premiere  pro so this is something adobe
3gmTXDcFJN4,4485199,4492000,that's weird adobe is doing it sounds  like  only in relation to these two updates
3gmTXDcFJN4,4492000,4498320,the one about two months ago and the one  on the 23rd  so  adobe wasn't able to solve it they
3gmTXDcFJN4,4498320,4505280,thought it was a permissions issue i  then went in and saw that at the same  time there had been
3gmTXDcFJN4,4505280,4511840,a windows update two months ago i  uninstalled that update and  all of a sudden i could go back to
3gmTXDcFJN4,4511840,4517679,openings  so it's a compatibility issue between  the windows update and premiere and
3gmTXDcFJN4,4517679,4524880,premiere and adobe didn't know anything  about it  not two months ago and the same thing  happened over the last few days
3gmTXDcFJN4,4524880,4530960,so there appears to have been an update  on the 23rd it really didn't seem to be  impacting me until later in the day on
3gmTXDcFJN4,4530960,4536080,the 24th  um adobe was not
3gmTXDcFJN4,4536080,4543520,seemingly aware of that update um i  tried rolling back  the windows update again i could get
3gmTXDcFJN4,4543520,4549679,back into opening adobe which i couldn't  do before rolling that back  but now it keeps
3gmTXDcFJN4,4549679,4555920,showing pending pending pending that it  wants to install meaning windows wants  to install those updates how important
3gmTXDcFJN4,4555920,4561760,is premiere pro to your  life it sounds like pretty important  core  core
3gmTXDcFJN4,4561760,4567120,computer design  for premiere okay here's what you're  gonna have to do i think
3gmTXDcFJN4,4567120,4574560,something's messed up  the easiest way to fix this it would be  to start over reinstall windows when you
3gmTXDcFJN4,4574560,4580400,download it from microsoft.com they have  a windows media creation tool you'll be  getting the latest version and then
3gmTXDcFJN4,4580400,4585520,install a fresh copy of premiere on pro  on top of that and since you have  creative cloud that's not going to be a
3gmTXDcFJN4,4585520,4591760,hard thing to do i think at that point  it should all work leo laporte the tech  guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,4591760,4595158,hold on janet
3gmTXDcFJN4,4600880,4606159,because it sounds like it's not just  it's not a general issue
3gmTXDcFJN4,4606159,4611280,it sounds like it's it's with regard to  the way your machine is configured or  something like that channel by the way
3gmTXDcFJN4,4611280,4617120,we're not on the air anymore you can  breathe a sigh of relief  nobody
3gmTXDcFJN4,4617120,4624800,and this was you know a major  manufacturer and it was built  specifically for premier i don't think  it's the hardware but it's easy enough
3gmTXDcFJN4,4624800,4632640,for uh windows get messed up  again i'm being very technical here
3gmTXDcFJN4,4632640,4637760,uh so i  do you do do you have a lot of other  stuff on the machine you can't afford to
3gmTXDcFJN4,4637760,4643040,lose or something or  yeah so everything will happen you're  gonna have to back up all of that
3gmTXDcFJN4,4643040,4649920,yeah and you have to do it primarily for  premiere yeah well that's why i asked  because this is a pain in the butt but
3gmTXDcFJN4,4649920,4655840,job one is getting premier working  uh then i would suggest uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,4655840,4662239,how old is a machine  um just a little over a year and already  um with the manufacturer that i'm not
3gmTXDcFJN4,4662239,4668080,gonna mention we already did one  uninstall and reinstalling oh and then  reinstalling it so you went to them and
3gmTXDcFJN4,4668080,4673120,they said well let's do this that's by  the way that's their sop because they  don't know what's you know software's
3gmTXDcFJN4,4673120,4679679,going on so they want to get you back to  the way it was when you  bought it and that did not and then you  reinstalled adobe premiere pro and it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4679679,4685600,still had a problem  well no this only came up recently so  that happened many many months ago some
3gmTXDcFJN4,4685600,4692719,other issues that i'm not going to get  into that are not related um and i have  an a another computer for premiere pro
3gmTXDcFJN4,4692719,4698640,that doesn't seem to have any of this  going this is life in the windows lane i  hate to say it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4698640,4705360,uh  uh  but if i if i may if we're not on the  air so um
3gmTXDcFJN4,4705360,4710960,after we did all those reinstalls with  some exceptions so it wasn't 100 perfect
3gmTXDcFJN4,4710960,4716560,um  you know i have not run into this  problem until two months ago in relation
3gmTXDcFJN4,4716560,4721920,to that windows update  and it was something where one day you
3gmTXDcFJN4,4721920,4727199,just can't open premiere periods yeah do  you i presume have tried uninstalling
3gmTXDcFJN4,4727199,4734080,fully uninstalling premiere and  reinstalling it yes and that did not fix  it correct yeah so some interaction
3gmTXDcFJN4,4734080,4739600,between windows and premiere you know my  hope was well maybe just premiere is is  messed up that can happen and then it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4739600,4744800,won't run  right uh it is conceivable  that there's something in this windows
3gmTXDcFJN4,4744800,4750320,update that doesn't work with premiere  but the fact that adobe doesn't know  about that
3gmTXDcFJN4,4750640,4757280,it kind of indicates it's probably not  because it'd be why if look everybody's  got that update if everybody who had
3gmTXDcFJN4,4757280,4763280,that update couldn't run premiere pro i  think adobe would know about it i would  think so too and that's the thing that's
3gmTXDcFJN4,4763280,4769360,bizarre to me um  because um and it is you know it's just  like night and day like a switch has
3gmTXDcFJN4,4769360,4774560,gone off and you don't actually believe  it or not we use premiere pro on windows  here
3gmTXDcFJN4,4774560,4779920,we were using windows 8 and we have 86  editors we're using windows 8 until just
3gmTXDcFJN4,4779920,4786080,recently when we bought new computers  and we never updated it because uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,4786080,4793120,probably for this reason you know once  you get it stable and it's a work  computer and your editor and you need to  have this working you don't mess with it
3gmTXDcFJN4,4793120,4799280,right um so  but i think it is a compatibility oh but  then one more question do you have
3gmTXDcFJN4,4799280,4804640,antivirus software running on there  um no just whatever comes with the  windows good you don't have trend micro
3gmTXDcFJN4,4804640,4810880,because that is a known problem with  trend micro a good question no okay i i  try to follow all of your advice thank
3gmTXDcFJN4,4810880,4816480,you and that's good advice in this case  yes uh  so sometimes security software will
3gmTXDcFJN4,4816480,4823360,block a program from launching  i appreciate your calling janet i'm i  have no answer for you except the really
3gmTXDcFJN4,4823360,4828560,one you don't want to hear which is  but how but this is important
3gmTXDcFJN4,4828560,4833600,a fresh install  with a current version of windows and  premiere and just hope that it was some
3gmTXDcFJN4,4833600,4839760,weird thing that happened  like it's like they said a permissions  issue or something
3gmTXDcFJN4,4839760,4845679,reinstalling will should fix all that i  know it's a waste of your afternoon  well more than an afternoon but in any
3gmTXDcFJN4,4845679,4850800,case um  because i mean i've got a lot of red  projects and other things on here yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,4850800,4855840,but these are net frame type of updates  does that tell you anything it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,4855840,4861440,just.net i don't know off the top of my  head no okay and i unfortunately i have  to run i've got to do it you've been
3gmTXDcFJN4,4861440,4867520,awesome thank you sorry janet thank you  [Music]  i want to i want to talk a little bit

3gmTXDcFJN4,5042080,5047520,it's time for our photo guy chris  marquart is here he is a brilliant
3gmTXDcFJN4,5047520,5052880,photographer uh teaches classes and  workshops at sensei.photo
3gmTXDcFJN4,5052880,5058560,he's written many books including a book  i love uh on wide-angle photography
3gmTXDcFJN4,5058560,5063600,another one i love on  film photography in fact it's your fault
3gmTXDcFJN4,5063600,5070639,chris that i have two film cameras that  i bought recently  i feel bad you do what you want to do
3gmTXDcFJN4,5070639,5077679,did you buy well you you helped me buy  them i have a leica m3 that uh are those  ones is it classic and then i have i
3gmTXDcFJN4,5077679,5084080,always wanted when i was a kid all my  life i've seen photographers  looking down at their waist shooting
3gmTXDcFJN4,5084080,5089520,with a camera at their waist and then  cranking  and and i found out that that's a roller
3gmTXDcFJN4,5089520,5096320,flare that's it right there you got one  one of these this one this one is a  ukrainian one an old oh that's weird i
3gmTXDcFJN4,5096320,5101440,know it's a copy yeah yeah but i have a  i have a roll of flex uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,5101440,5109120,same same vintage as my with its  original leather case  and uh it's fun uh but i have to say
3gmTXDcFJN4,5109120,5114960,it's they're not as good as my digital  cameras really well
3gmTXDcFJN4,5114960,5121440,there are people out there who would  probably beg to differ because um the  the whole film photography field has
3gmTXDcFJN4,5121440,5127199,seen quite a big resurgence recently and  that includes a lot of young people who
3gmTXDcFJN4,5127199,5133920,didn't grow up with that um picking up  used film cameras  still in colleges all over the country
3gmTXDcFJN4,5133920,5140800,when they teach photography beginners  start usually with film cameras  my nephew is a student at the very
3gmTXDcFJN4,5140800,5149440,prestigious rhode island school of  design majoring in photography they're  shooting uh  with olympus om1 film cameras
3gmTXDcFJN4,5149440,5154560,nothing wrong with that it forces you  into a specific kind of working and  thinking which you can't get with
3gmTXDcFJN4,5154560,5160560,digital so  digital's too easy  yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,5160560,5166480,actually yes so you know you know  addicts around the country hold  veritable really good treasures
3gmTXDcFJN4,5166480,5171520,or if you ask a friend or family like  do you remem remember if grandpa still
3gmTXDcFJN4,5171520,5177199,has his old camera there will be there  will be treasures coming up um of course
3gmTXDcFJN4,5177199,5183040,there's online there's ebay there's  craigslist and other places the usual  suspects where you can get used cameras
3gmTXDcFJN4,5183040,5188320,and can you still get your film  oh yes you can you can kodak still makes
3gmTXDcFJN4,5188320,5193600,film fujifilm makes film there's a lot  of smaller manufacturers now that have
3gmTXDcFJN4,5193600,5199120,emerged over the years  so there is film not as much as as there
3gmTXDcFJN4,5199120,5205840,used to be but most of that you buy  online these days so  um but you picked up the camera you have
3gmTXDcFJN4,5205840,5212800,this old camera and now there are a few  things to look at  to make sure it's working properly and
3gmTXDcFJN4,5212800,5217840,one of the first the first thing that i  would typically look at is light leaks
3gmTXDcFJN4,5217840,5223600,so  the camera has a has a light seal at the  back where you put the film in
3gmTXDcFJN4,5223600,5230080,that film doesn't that light doesn't  come in other than through the lens  and there are different kinds of
3gmTXDcFJN4,5230080,5236639,seals back there there's what we call a  labyrinth seal which is just the way the  the the corners are folded over each
3gmTXDcFJN4,5236639,5245120,other so light doesn't come in those are  normally not critical  um  there's foam seals and those
3gmTXDcFJN4,5245120,5250400,can be dodgy because especially if  an old camera from let's say the 1970s
3gmTXDcFJN4,5250400,5256080,they don't age  yeah  well  foam back in the 1970s was it was a new
3gmTXDcFJN4,5256080,5261760,material the phone has only been  developed in the 60s so  they didn't have long-term experience
3gmTXDcFJN4,5261760,5268000,with some of the phones and decades  later that might decompose so you can  check for that carefully with a
3gmTXDcFJN4,5268000,5273920,toothpick because sometimes that turns  into like a tar-like substance so  those can
3gmTXDcFJN4,5273920,5281360,luckily be switched out there's  replacement kits that you can buy on  ebay and other places so
3gmTXDcFJN4,5281360,5286880,with new forms so you can do this that's  a diy job for a sunday afternoon kind of
3gmTXDcFJN4,5286880,5293199,take a toothpick and scratch the old  stuff out and put the new stuff in  and there's a third kind of seal
3gmTXDcFJN4,5293199,5298560,which um are typically okay if even  after many years and that's velvet seals
3gmTXDcFJN4,5298560,5303840,they used to put real velvet  in there  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,5303840,5310480,very elegant some older cameras have red  velvet seals there's black velvet seals  um so that's the first thing the light
3gmTXDcFJN4,5310480,5316320,leaks and by the way you find out about  light leaks by just putting a roll of  film in there  and shooting and then looking at the
3gmTXDcFJN4,5316320,5322880,pictures if there's weird weird  phenomena with with bright edges and  things that is typically a light leak so
3gmTXDcFJN4,5322880,5330400,that's the first thing this the light  leaks the second one is the shutter  shutters  age and especially the material a
3gmTXDcFJN4,5330400,5337840,shutter is like a clockwork you know so  it's a mechanical thing and that has  lubricants in it and the
3gmTXDcFJN4,5337840,5343840,dust can get in there  uh so that clockwork that shutter  clockwork can get gummed up a bit over
3gmTXDcFJN4,5343840,5349040,time like oils age and they get a bit um
3gmTXDcFJN4,5349040,5356800,they don't they don't they don't  lubricate us as well like that and that  will manifest itself through
3gmTXDcFJN4,5356800,5362960,shutter speeds that are slower than  advertised like if you set this to 100th  of a second
3gmTXDcFJN4,5362960,5368960,and you take a picture they might  actually just take a picture of a 50th  of a second because it's slower because
3gmTXDcFJN4,5368960,5374080,it's gummed up  um  finding out
3gmTXDcFJN4,5374080,5379120,again take a roll of film shoot pictures  based on your light meter and then you
3gmTXDcFJN4,5379120,5385520,will see that if pictures come out too  bright all the time then that's a good  indication there's also free app
3gmTXDcFJN4,5385520,5390719,for ios and for android called shutter  speed  that uses your your smartphone's
3gmTXDcFJN4,5390719,5397040,microphone to listen to the click and  gives you the timing between like the  first and the last click so you can
3gmTXDcFJN4,5397040,5402639,sort of measure the shutter speed  again  those are fully mechanical these cameras
3gmTXDcFJN4,5402639,5408000,you can't you can you see a little peak  and when the shutter opens in another  peak when it closes and
3gmTXDcFJN4,5408000,5414320,and it tells you how fast that was  um  another fix for for gummed up shutters
3gmTXDcFJN4,5414320,5419760,or at least a temporary fix is what i  used to call  shutter gymnastics
3gmTXDcFJN4,5419760,5425520,which is just actuate click and and and  and wind up the camera and click it  again
3gmTXDcFJN4,5425520,5433199,50 times just move it get it moving it's  like with an old machine you have to  uh to to move it
3gmTXDcFJN4,5433199,5440480,another fix is slightly warming it up in  the oven believe it or not because that  will make some of the old oils be
3gmTXDcFJN4,5440480,5447920,get better again um don't heat it up  just warm it up  um or if that doesn't crazy
3gmTXDcFJN4,5452320,5457520,oh i'm baking the camera don't mind me  it's not baking that's or warming it up
3gmTXDcFJN4,5457520,5464080,so that's that's the second thing the  shutters are  all shutters can be a bit
3gmTXDcFJN4,5464080,5470080,um a bit of a diva sometimes and the  third thing of course i would look at is  the lenses
3gmTXDcFJN4,5470080,5476960,and uh again they have mechanics so  check for those mechanics but um good  news is these are all very inexpensive
3gmTXDcFJN4,5476960,5483120,because nobody wants them anymore oh  yeah yeah yeah you can get amazing the  last thing  the lenses
3gmTXDcFJN4,5483120,5489120,is the glass in the lenses might have if  it was if it wasn't  in  a
3gmTXDcFJN4,5489120,5495440,in a humid cellar or something for for  20 years it might have some fungus in it  yeah and you can see that and that's not
3gmTXDcFJN4,5495440,5502480,a good thing so that's one thing to  watch out for so that's the three main  things the lenses shutter
3gmTXDcFJN4,5502480,5507840,and the light leaks then  most of those won't be a problem but if
3gmTXDcFJN4,5507840,5513920,they are now you know what to do about  where do you bring your film after you  shoot and shoot it  i mean
3gmTXDcFJN4,5513920,5519760,there's there's there's labs you can  send it in there's there's lots lots of  that stuff has moved online so you can
3gmTXDcFJN4,5519760,5526320,you can send it in to have it processed  and get scans back and pictures back and  yeah that's so then it becomes digital
3gmTXDcFJN4,5526320,5531440,at that point your image is uh it's not  a print it's digital yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,5531440,5538080,you can get them printed as well  or or you should or you should you  should polaroid or instax and you just
3gmTXDcFJN4,5538080,5543120,create  a picture on paper those are big with  the kids now everybody likes those
3gmTXDcFJN4,5543120,5548960,instant photography cameras  great for parties  is the money is the money maker for
3gmTXDcFJN4,5548960,5554800,fujifilm yeah big one it's really  interesting yeah yeah it's not pure  nostalgia i mean some of it's nostalgia
3gmTXDcFJN4,5554800,5561440,this for me it's a nostalgia thing but  it's also um it's an interesting  discipline to shoot film
3gmTXDcFJN4,5561440,5567760,you don't get to  chimp you don't get to look in the  sensor on the back and see  let's take another one
3gmTXDcFJN4,5567760,5574719,into a different mode of thinking  because yeah you have to you have to be  patient and every shot costs money
3gmTXDcFJN4,5574719,5580639,you know it's not they're you know every  shot is expensive  chris marquart he has a great book on
3gmTXDcFJN4,5580639,5586800,film photography highly recommend it  you'll find it at sensei.photo  uh and also don't forget his podcast
3gmTXDcFJN4,5586800,5593040,tips from the top floor  he also has one of the future  photography so he's not just looking  back he's looking forward too
3gmTXDcFJN4,5593040,5599360,and he joins us every week thank you  chris  thank you
3gmTXDcFJN4,5600719,5606960,yeah i gave uh  i gave lisa i think an instax printer so
3gmTXDcFJN4,5606960,5613440,she could take a picture with her camera  phone and then it pairs to the printer  and has an instant print  that it's kind of cool and she never
3gmTXDcFJN4,5613440,5619360,uses it but it's kind of cool it's  really uh  an interesting  these kind of things are good for
3gmTXDcFJN4,5619360,5626320,parties and even if people around just  print out a few snaps and  hand it to people that's that these are
3gmTXDcFJN4,5626320,5631520,unique you know you're creating a  one-of-a-kind thing which is um you  can't see when you when you shoot
3gmTXDcFJN4,5631520,5639840,directly when you shoot directly on the  medium then that is there's a different  feeling it's the nfts of photography
3gmTXDcFJN4,5639840,5645600,uh sort of yeah  um  i you know i'm obviously
3gmTXDcFJN4,5645600,5651920,uh i was just looking at sales for uh  camera sales and they're just plummeting  because  nobody's buying cameras anymore
3gmTXDcFJN4,5651920,5658159,especially point-and-shoots but even uh  slrs  are you know slowly dwindling but the
3gmTXDcFJN4,5658159,5663679,compact digital cameras are or the  compact digital ones are on the way out  yeah because because you have a phone
3gmTXDcFJN4,5663679,5668880,that does everybody as well  oh it says i've said it for for 10 years
3gmTXDcFJN4,5668880,5676080,phones are taking over yeah yeah i'm not  gonna i'll just bring uh my phone uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,5676080,5682000,to visit my mom i don't see any reason  to bring a fancy camera although i could  do some fun shots with her i'd love to
3gmTXDcFJN4,5682000,5689679,but uh  i'd probably just bring the phone  yeah it's what a world quick reminder
3gmTXDcFJN4,5689679,5695679,quick reminder next week i'll be  in southern germany in the black forest  have fun with my parents have a
3gmTXDcFJN4,5695679,5702239,wonderful trip i'll be with my mom in uh  in two days so i understand yeah have
3gmTXDcFJN4,5702239,5709360,fun and we'll see you in two weeks  i'll see you on the 10th all right all  right take care
3gmTXDcFJN4,5709360,5716080,leo laporte the tech guy 8888  ask leo the phone number i feel so bad
3gmTXDcFJN4,5716080,5723360,uh with janet i just don't  uh i'm not sure what's going on and  honestly the
3gmTXDcFJN4,5724159,5731119,the the few things uh in our uh in our  toolkit are inadequate to the problem
3gmTXDcFJN4,5731119,5737119,she uh updated windows she's on a  current version 21 h1 of windows 10
3gmTXDcFJN4,5737119,5744000,updated it and all of a sudden uh adobe  premiere their video editing program  stopped working
3gmTXDcFJN4,5744000,5750000,and adobe doesn't know why  i'm sure microsoft has no idea why in  fact i don't think it's a widespread
3gmTXDcFJN4,5750000,5756159,issue  or we you know probably know more about  it you'd be able to google it and find  it so it's something unique to her
3gmTXDcFJN4,5756159,5763760,system  okay well that's that's a data point  how do you solve this
3gmTXDcFJN4,5763760,5770960,i do have to say the first thing i  always look for if something's acting  funny is other programs interfering in
3gmTXDcFJN4,5770960,5776880,particular security software not at all  unusual  it's one of the reasons i've kind of
3gmTXDcFJN4,5776880,5782239,formed a dislike for antivirus software  on window windows it comes with you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,5782239,5787760,microsoft defender which is adequate  uh and and you know there are lots of  reasons you might want to run an
3gmTXDcFJN4,5787760,5794800,antivirus if you've got a kid using the  computer or you know strangers or  it's in a challenging environment so i'm
3gmTXDcFJN4,5794800,5800960,not i'm not i'm not dead set against it  but because they can cause compatibility  issues often they're the source of more
3gmTXDcFJN4,5800960,5807520,problems than they solve  in this case she didn't have an extra  antivirus because she listens and she  has the same
3gmTXDcFJN4,5807520,5812880,idea i guess  so i hate to say it but at this point
3gmTXDcFJN4,5812880,5818560,i mean you could start  tearing out little bits and pieces of  windows here and there to see what's
3gmTXDcFJN4,5818560,5824840,causing the compatibility kind of hard  to see what's going on there are
3gmTXDcFJN4,5824840,5832080,logs windows has an event log  and  that might be a value
3gmTXDcFJN4,5832080,5839520,if you  because what's what's probably going to  happen  when you hit the uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,5839520,5845760,you know the premiere icon and you  launch it and it doesn't launch it's  gonna put something in the event in the
3gmTXDcFJN4,5845760,5854480,event viewer  so uh there is a program called event  viewer that lets you view the event logs
3gmTXDcFJN4,5854480,5859520,the only reason i'll talk about it more  is because  it's easy to
3gmTXDcFJN4,5859520,5865520,underestimate  what you're reading the importance of  what reading overestimate it really more  likely
3gmTXDcFJN4,5865520,5873360,free you'll you may freak out because it  looks like everything's failing windows  has all sorts of negative events
3gmTXDcFJN4,5873360,5879520,um critical errors and warnings and all  sorts of things but it's probably a good  idea to go through the logs and
3gmTXDcFJN4,5879520,5885119,especially do it right after  premiere pro won't launch
3gmTXDcFJN4,5885119,5890400,and see if you can see  what's going on i'm looking at a what
3gmTXDcFJN4,5890400,5896719,to me is a completely fully operational  version of windows 11 on a brand new  machine as soon as i go to
3gmTXDcFJN4,5896719,5904119,administrative events  well look like half an hour ago there  was an event
3gmTXDcFJN4,5904119,5910400,4227 with tcpip failed to establish an  outgoing connection because the selected  local endpoint was recently used to
3gmTXDcFJN4,5910400,5917040,connect the same remote endpoint  there was an application hang earlier  this morning system sevens stopped
3gmTXDcFJN4,5917040,5924080,interacting with windows and was closed  these things are going on all the time
3gmTXDcFJN4,5924080,5930800,there's there's a variety of logs the  application logs i see a application  hang i see error reporting i see
3gmTXDcFJN4,5930800,5935920,security  it's very easy to look at these and go
3gmTXDcFJN4,5935920,5940960,wow  i'm amazed windows runs at all
3gmTXDcFJN4,5940960,5948000,but you might be able to glean a clue  there you know  if if a you know adobe premiere
3gmTXDcFJN4,5948000,5953520,system hang or application hanger didn't  launch you might be able to but often  times the computer is kind of dumb about
3gmTXDcFJN4,5953520,5959760,what happened so the log will contain  something that isn't that useful or at  least not that actionable still worth
3gmTXDcFJN4,5959760,5966239,checking  [Music]  you're trying to track down you know  what is this interaction
3gmTXDcFJN4,5966239,5971600,what's going on  but ultimately the easiest it doesn't
3gmTXDcFJN4,5971600,5977199,sound easy but the easiest thing is to  back up your data  wipe your drive reinstall windows
3gmTXDcFJN4,5977199,5982880,reinstall uh  the the program that's not working in  this case premiere pro and
3gmTXDcFJN4,5982880,5988159,see if that helps now if that doesn't  work i don't all bets are off  because we're starting with a fresh
3gmTXDcFJN4,5988159,5993600,install right  miles on the line from san juan  capistrano hi miles leo laporte the tech
3gmTXDcFJN4,5993600,5999040,guy  hi leo how are you doing today i am well  how are you
3gmTXDcFJN4,5999040,6004080,doing well first time caller been  listening to you for a long time
3gmTXDcFJN4,6004080,6009679,welcome i have just remodeled my  entertainment room
3gmTXDcFJN4,6009679,6015840,home theater  and i ran all the wires into the wall it  came out absolutely beautiful i'm
3gmTXDcFJN4,6015840,6024560,running a samsung lg  old  g2 nice very nice tv yeah absolutely
3gmTXDcFJN4,6024560,6029920,yeah beautiful gorgeous easy gorgeous  couple questions i'm gonna probably
3gmTXDcFJN4,6029920,6036639,start streaming it looks like  should i run a hardwire into the router
3gmTXDcFJN4,6036639,6043199,for the tv can i do that by wi-fi what's  your suggestion on that so you can  stream that you mean inbound streaming
3gmTXDcFJN4,6043199,6049760,you don't mean you're going to start  your own tv channel in the living room  right so on youtube yeah just so you're  watching netflix amazon prime premiere
3gmTXDcFJN4,6049760,6055760,hulu all that stuff  uh  honestly the best thing is a hardwired
3gmTXDcFJN4,6055760,6061360,connection and the other a couple of  years ago we did in fact
3gmTXDcFJN4,6061360,6066719,remodel to the extent we had somebody  crawling up in the attic and underneath  in the crawl space
3gmTXDcFJN4,6066719,6073280,running ethernet to the places where  there are work computers because we're  zooming more because of
3gmTXDcFJN4,6073280,6078719,pandemic and tvs that is going to always  give you the best results but if you
3gmTXDcFJN4,6078719,6084800,have good wi-fi and a good quality  signal you're fairly close to the wi-fi  base station that's what most people use
3gmTXDcFJN4,6084800,6091760,should be good enough  sure  and uh  fantastic yeah so in other words yeah it
3gmTXDcFJN4,6091760,6097280,would be better always is better to do  hardwired  but  it's going to be a little bit faster but
3gmTXDcFJN4,6097280,6103440,if you've got good you you're getting uh  on your wi-fi you're getting 100  megabits down on your computer yeah yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6103440,6109360,yeah uh i um  went for uh uh you're probably familiar
3gmTXDcFJN4,6109360,6114719,with cox yeah  and i'm using their high volume perfect
3gmTXDcFJN4,6114719,6120400,back to the service perfect and  uh but my wife is zooming upstairs now
3gmTXDcFJN4,6120400,6125679,since cobit  and uh  you know we we have uh a few machines
3gmTXDcFJN4,6125679,6133920,running in the house but it seems  adequate  here's what i would do you know it's a  pain to put ethernet in so try the wi-fi
3gmTXDcFJN4,6133920,6141679,if it's working fine don't worry about  it  uh  i put the router uh as well as the the
3gmTXDcFJN4,6141679,6146719,wi-fi right next to  below the tv entertainment center oh
3gmTXDcFJN4,6146719,6152960,well you're golden then  yeah it really wouldn't be that bad then  do it then do it you'll just be glad you
3gmTXDcFJN4,6152960,6159600,did it yeah yeah as long as you have an  extra ethernet port i would always do  that it's uh it's always going to be
3gmTXDcFJN4,6159600,6164719,you know better speed  it's true that a lot of people can do  that because often the especially if you
3gmTXDcFJN4,6164719,6171360,have cable internet that's the same  you know place the cable internet comes  in is where your tv comes in so good
3gmTXDcFJN4,6171360,6176719,uh i think that's a good way to do it  and what's the best way to get more  ports
3gmTXDcFJN4,6176719,6182560,um there are a couple of things you can  do if you  only have one or two you have a router i
3gmTXDcFJN4,6182560,6190400,presume or you're using the cox router  yes  no i have my own router okay and it has  some ports but you want more
3gmTXDcFJN4,6190400,6195840,yeah it actually only has two ports i'm  running uh directly into
3gmTXDcFJN4,6195840,6201280,uh my  apple tv as well as oh yeah you run out
3gmTXDcFJN4,6201280,6207920,yeah yeah  so  so you you know you can get a switch  we used to get hubs
3gmTXDcFJN4,6207920,6213760,uh you might even remember that in the  early days of home networking you get  something that was completely passive
3gmTXDcFJN4,6213760,6218880,that was like the the hub on a wagon  wheel and it would just  have a bunch of ethernet coming off of
3gmTXDcFJN4,6218880,6225199,it nowadays most of the devices you buy  are managed switches  a lot of companies make these netgear
3gmTXDcFJN4,6225199,6230320,makes very good uh switches  so uh you know you can pick them up
3gmTXDcFJN4,6230320,6236000,tp-link does too a lot of companies do  and they're managed only in to the you  don't have to do anything with them
3gmTXDcFJN4,6236000,6243600,they're only managed to the  extent that they  you know maybe you have a little bit  more smarts uh for 15 bucks you can get
3gmTXDcFJN4,6243600,6250080,a net gear five port gigabit ethernet  it's an unmanaged switch which is fine
3gmTXDcFJN4,6250080,6255360,um i've used the netgears before they  have an eight port for 40 bucks that  should be more right
3gmTXDcFJN4,6255360,6260800,exactly yeah  are you local in los angeles how are you  no we're not we're up in northern
3gmTXDcFJN4,6260800,6266159,california but uh  hope leo laporte the tech guy got a  break

3gmTXDcFJN4,6295600,6301520,10 failing  windows 11 working somebody uh i think  scooter x in our chat room we were
3gmTXDcFJN4,6301520,6308159,talking uh with janet about windows 10  and  uh adobe premiere not playing nice and s
3gmTXDcFJN4,6308159,6314480,uh we'll put this in the show notes but  uh scooter x in the chat room came up  with a link that said  oh yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6314480,6319960,uh could not open key it's on the  premierepro.fandom.com
3gmTXDcFJN4,6320159,6326480,wiki  error could not open key  verify that you have success sufficient
3gmTXDcFJN4,6326480,6333520,access to that key or contact your  support personnel error 1402 air 1406
3gmTXDcFJN4,6333520,6338960,and there's a registry fix  which is weird
3gmTXDcFJN4,6338960,6345840,i think a little bit of blame on adobe  for this adobe doesn't microsoft used to  be this way too on the mac doesn't like
3gmTXDcFJN4,6345840,6352159,to do things  the official way they like to do them  their way
3gmTXDcFJN4,6352159,6357440,and sometimes i think they get a little  trouble by  you know kind of going around
3gmTXDcFJN4,6357440,6363440,microsoft's official  uh systems so maybe that's maybe we'll  you know what we'll keep collecting
3gmTXDcFJN4,6363440,6369360,solutions that's all we can do  sounds like a registry issue possibly
3gmTXDcFJN4,6369360,6377600,herb and rancho santa fe california's  next hello herb  hi leon hello i came home from taking my
3gmTXDcFJN4,6377600,6383440,wife to lunch today and i walked in and  turned on the radio and you were talking  with the lady that was having problems
3gmTXDcFJN4,6383440,6389440,with adobe  her mail program all right yahoo yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6389440,6396000,yeah yeah  uh i've had it  i had att.net for years and years and
3gmTXDcFJN4,6396000,6401119,years and adobe apparently got in there  somehow yahoo did yeah so yahoo
3gmTXDcFJN4,6401119,6407920,a lot of these companies both verizon  and att didn't want to do their own mail  system so that for their subscribers
3gmTXDcFJN4,6407920,6413520,they  they kind of worked with yahoo and then  and then i think verizon i mean
3gmTXDcFJN4,6413520,6420800,like i said it's a confusing tattered  saga but at some point i think verizon  and att both had some ownership stakes
3gmTXDcFJN4,6420800,6426400,in any event uh  you know uh  many many people have yahoo mail because
3gmTXDcFJN4,6426400,6434000,of those two companies i guess were you  uh att you said  yes yeah yes yeah well the question i
3gmTXDcFJN4,6434000,6439440,have is uh i  i'm  getting past the patient's
3gmTXDcFJN4,6439440,6446960,period time to get new email  uh there you go and that was going to be  my question do you have a uh what's your
3gmTXDcFJN4,6446960,6453360,first and second choice well i i am a  little different on this one and you  know it sounds like you're a little
3gmTXDcFJN4,6453360,6459280,older maybe email for you is more  recreational and business focused  oh yeah yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6459280,6465840,um  i honestly think i mean so many people  rely so much on email
3gmTXDcFJN4,6465840,6472960,and yet want to use a free email service  and i sometimes feel like maybe we're  being a little cheap
3gmTXDcFJN4,6472960,6479360,and it might be worth  if you wanted for instance the free  services yahoo mail and gmail
3gmTXDcFJN4,6479360,6486639,uh outlook mail those are the big three  microsoft does outlook.com google does  gmail.com yahoo whoever
3gmTXDcFJN4,6486639,6491760,owns them does yahoo mail  those are the big three free services
3gmTXDcFJN4,6491760,6496800,they're ad supported but good luck  getting support if you have a problem
3gmTXDcFJN4,6496800,6503520,good luck calling somebody and saying  fix this  when it's free  they can't afford really to provide good
3gmTXDcFJN4,6503520,6510320,tech support on the other hand for as  little as 50 bucks a year you can pay  for email and there'll be somebody on
3gmTXDcFJN4,6510320,6517360,the other line end of the line and  because they're making money off you  they'll kind of pay more attention plus  you won't get ads in your email
3gmTXDcFJN4,6517360,6523360,so maybe not for you her but maybe not  for me because you know we don't use  email for business
3gmTXDcFJN4,6523360,6528719,but so but if you use an email for  business you should pay for it you  should go to a company like fast mail or
3gmTXDcFJN4,6528719,6534639,proton mail or oh there are many many  companies ireland mail their million of  them that do email and they and it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,6534639,6540639,their business and they pay attention  and they have somebody on the other line  you can call it all that if you want
3gmTXDcFJN4,6540639,6547760,free email i think there's no question  google's is the best gmail.com it's  certainly the biggest
3gmTXDcFJN4,6547920,6553760,so  unless you use a mac do you use a mac  yes  so
3gmTXDcFJN4,6553760,6560000,apple might be a better choice in that  case you know they have uh icloud mail  and you can have it address herb at
3gmTXDcFJN4,6560000,6566159,icloud.com or herb at me.com  uh  that's free
3gmTXDcFJN4,6566159,6573040,uh because you're already in effect  paying for it by buying an apple product  uh you can buy more storage if you want
3gmTXDcFJN4,6573040,6578639,and i think apple's security  and focus on privacy is much better than
3gmTXDcFJN4,6578639,6583840,google's  so maybe maybe for you icloud would be a  good choice
3gmTXDcFJN4,6583840,6590000,well it sounds good my only problem with  that is uh uh where i live uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,6590639,6597119,uh a t mail or my computer my internet  is at yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6597119,6602320,about 1.8 megabytes time yeah well the  good news is email is a good choice
3gmTXDcFJN4,6602320,6608880,because it doesn't need speed it might  take a while to get your email but it  doesn't need speed
3gmTXDcFJN4,6608880,6615199,um i think it's almost always a mistake  to say well well att is my internet  service provider so i'm going to use the
3gmTXDcFJN4,6615199,6621679,free email that they provide the worst  email comes from your internet service  provider in every respect they spy on
3gmTXDcFJN4,6621679,6628719,you they don't care if it's working it's  not their primary business it's always  an afterthought so just because you have
3gmTXDcFJN4,6628719,6633920,a t as your internet service provider or  your phone company i still i think apple
3gmTXDcFJN4,6633920,6639280,would be a good choice and actually  outlook.com microsoft solution if you're  a windows user is not a bad choice
3gmTXDcFJN4,6639280,6645520,either uh at least they're making money  from you in other ways so and they kind  of want to keep you happy well i i
3gmTXDcFJN4,6645520,6651840,understand and appreciate that uh now  the speed is speed shouldn't matter now  that's very slow for surfing the
3gmTXDcFJN4,6651840,6658880,internet yes that's not going to be  great  you know that drives me nuts but yeah i  don't you that that's another problem
3gmTXDcFJN4,6658880,6663920,you should definitely get the best you  can  i know it's expensive
3gmTXDcFJN4,6663920,6670239,do you know anything about hughes uh  satellite satellite's not great are you  uh far enough away you're kind of out of
3gmTXDcFJN4,6670239,6676320,the uh out of the  area of the phone company kind of  they only go about two miles and then it
3gmTXDcFJN4,6676320,6681920,gets deteriorates  it's uh it's their own phone system yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6681920,6688719,yeah eight tnt they it's called ubers  and it's they have cable um
3gmTXDcFJN4,6688719,6693760,does your cable company offer internet  no there's no cable where i live yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,6693760,6698960,you know rancho santa fe yeah and i  don't i mean i know where it is but i  don't i don't know it well
3gmTXDcFJN4,6698960,6704080,so they some of the areas have the high  speed uh  male but
3gmTXDcFJN4,6704080,6709280,that goes from a a joint  connection by way of
3gmTXDcFJN4,6709280,6716880,uh 80-year-old wires  it's kind of amazing it works at all 1.8  megabits is amazing
3gmTXDcFJN4,6717280,6723119,yeah hughes is expensive and they have  caps  you know elon has promised elon musk has
3gmTXDcFJN4,6723119,6728560,promised uh that starlink will provide  good wireless in rural areas like yours
3gmTXDcFJN4,6728560,6734719,but that's also expensive it's 500 bucks  for the dish and then 110 bucks a month  so
3gmTXDcFJN4,6734719,6740560,yeah and satellite internet generally uh  is not very good it's going to be better  than 1.8 megabits
3gmTXDcFJN4,6740560,6748000,um yeah yeah this is a problem in rural  areas in this country we just don't have  good choices if att ever upgrades its
3gmTXDcFJN4,6748000,6754960,u-verse to fiber maybe  maybe well they've made promises i had a
3gmTXDcFJN4,6754960,6761520,56k  when everybody else was in the gigabytes  and they promised
3gmTXDcFJN4,6761520,6768239,i guess if i go to apple i have to  that's a whole new email address it will  be a new email address but
3gmTXDcFJN4,6768239,6773520,this is a good time to do it because you  still have access to your old account  you can have it automatically forwarded
3gmTXDcFJN4,6773520,6779440,to your new address or you can have your  mail client pick it up i would use  apple's mail program given the slow
3gmTXDcFJN4,6779440,6785199,internet and let it you know just run  all the time and it'll keep your email  it'll keep it downloaded you don't have
3gmTXDcFJN4,6785199,6790960,to use the web browser to go to your  email you can just open it on your  desktop and so the speed won't be an
3gmTXDcFJN4,6790960,6798239,issue and you can have it go check the  old mailbox and then start adding to  your signature hey by the way i've moved
3gmTXDcFJN4,6798239,6803599,my new email address is  uh xyz at icloud.com
3gmTXDcFJN4,6803599,6809599,okay  all right great thank you thank you sir  always a pleasure good to talk to you i
3gmTXDcFJN4,6809599,6814719,i do know rancho santa fe is beautiful  this is the price you pay for living in
3gmTXDcFJN4,6814719,6822320,a beautiful part of the country  generally there is a direct trade-off  between the beauty of your surroundings
3gmTXDcFJN4,6822320,6828400,and the quality of your internet  the denser  you know the population the tighter
3gmTXDcFJN4,6828400,6833840,jammed you are the more likely there's  going to be an internet service provider  there who says hey it's worth digging a
3gmTXDcFJN4,6833840,6840080,trench out to those  that block because there's a thousand  people there i can make money from
3gmTXDcFJN4,6840080,6848080,when you're one person per square mile  nobody's gonna give you internet service  it's just too darn expensive the good  news is i i had high hopes for starlink
3gmTXDcFJN4,6848080,6854159,those hopes have kind of been dashed  uh  we were promised that as
3gmTXDcFJN4,6854159,6859840,more satellites went up the speed would  improve that doesn't seem to be the case  it's really not designed as i was hoping
3gmTXDcFJN4,6859840,6866239,it was to handle a lot of people  so and it's very pricey still
3gmTXDcFJN4,6866239,6871360,uh in fact they just raised the price so  that's not the solution i was hoping for
3gmTXDcFJN4,6871360,6878000,it's always good when you can get  competition right then the companies go  oh we might lose herb
3gmTXDcFJN4,6878320,6884400,in this case  they don't seem to care 88 88 ask leo  the phone number
3gmTXDcFJN4,6884400,6890880,rod pyle's coming up in just a little  bit our space guy  and uh and a surprise visit from dick de
3gmTXDcFJN4,6890880,6897760,bartolo our gizmo wizard he's gonna have  a gadget of the week in just a bit stay  here  [Music]
3gmTXDcFJN4,6897760,6905520,roderick  hello how are you i am well how are you  i'm good i i made a a nice discovery
3gmTXDcFJN4,6905520,6912800,yesterday what was that i was getting  together my stuff my little arctic track  in august and i thought you know
3gmTXDcFJN4,6912800,6918239,i i can't just have one of anything  because technology fails  and i know they only have power up there
3gmTXDcFJN4,6918239,6924719,a few hours a day because it's all on  generator and i thought i need a backup  laptop gee will i get a i better talk to
3gmTXDcFJN4,6924719,6930239,leo you know it'd be nice to get  something that i could charge with solar  batteries maybe an ipad or something
3gmTXDcFJN4,6930239,6935760,and i dug out my macbook  air from 2010
3gmTXDcFJN4,6935760,6941280,reloaded the latest operating system  update so there wasn't a bunch of crud  running in the background
3gmTXDcFJN4,6941280,6947119,turned off the wi-fi because there isn't  any up there and ran it where the word  processor going for 10 hours on that 12
3gmTXDcFJN4,6947119,6952400,year old battery  so i guess that's it there's your  solution apple man you already have what
3gmTXDcFJN4,6952400,6958960,you need and that's light and thin  yeah that's the one he pulled out of a  manila envelope
3gmTXDcFJN4,6958960,6964480,so i guess the question is i'll have to  figure out apparently you could charge  those off of
3gmTXDcFJN4,6964480,6969520,like phone bank batteries but it's a  little twitchy so i'll have to figure it  out yeah and solar you'd have to have a
3gmTXDcFJN4,6969520,6976239,big array to really get any  reasonable charging time well you do  although because it's sunny up there 24
3gmTXDcFJN4,6976239,6981840,hours a day you know we have a lot of  sun power banks yeah have the fold out  solar panels i'm testing one now it
3gmTXDcFJN4,6981840,6987280,looks like it'll charge a debate about  eight hours oh that's not bad oh that's  test and verify you know yeah i would
3gmTXDcFJN4,6987280,6993840,absolutely try before you go because  those those those solar chargers are
3gmTXDcFJN4,6993840,6999679,notoriously  slow and small and  not great  there's a reason they're inexpensive
3gmTXDcFJN4,6999679,7004800,yeah yeah  yeah  oh yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,7004800,7012480,cool  what do you want to talk about today  today we're going to talk about citizen  science for jupiter and the planetary
3gmTXDcFJN4,7012480,7018719,alignment that's happening  right now which is right i thought i  missed it
3gmTXDcFJN4,7018719,7025520,no it's gonna be for  you know it they'd say change really  slowly because the planet's changing the  sky very slowly so you're good for about
3gmTXDcFJN4,7025520,7032320,a week  you got to get it pre-dawned to see it  but it's worth it i think i actually get  up freedom tomorrow for a flight so

3gmTXDcFJN4,7332960,7338960,like a normal person for a while  is it tough when you're uh touring like
3gmTXDcFJN4,7338960,7346639,that you don't you sleep in a different  bed every night so it must be hard nope  nope nope my minivan is my home ah you
3gmTXDcFJN4,7346639,7352880,bring your house on your on your back  you're like a turtle  i get it what you hear about the old guy
3gmTXDcFJN4,7352880,7358080,in the minivan though  [Laughter]  there's a guy in town who's guys guests
3gmTXDcFJN4,7358080,7364080,got a good sense of humor although i  think it's kind of creepy he drives  around a  minivan with blacked out windows and is
3gmTXDcFJN4,7364080,7370960,painted on the side free candy  it seems to me  seems to me asking for trouble kids stay
3gmTXDcFJN4,7370960,7376000,away from that guy  uh that's uh if you could hook me up
3gmTXDcFJN4,7376000,7382320,with joanna  oh i will i'm uh just uh let's see how  we can do that we have your email put me
3gmTXDcFJN4,7382320,7389119,on hold put me on hold on and i'll give  you information i will we'll get you  joanna's uh she has a website and
3gmTXDcFJN4,7389119,7395280,everything she's you can sign up there  and  she's great emails a day though so we're
3gmTXDcFJN4,7395280,7401840,gonna make her famous if we keep this up  but mike my i'm just like you i i  thought you know here i am i'm talking
3gmTXDcFJN4,7401840,7408400,all day and all night and  my wife says you know uh  you know you never talk unless there's
3gmTXDcFJN4,7408400,7415040,an audience and i said well i'm  protecting my  my voice  you ought to try doing a comedy show
3gmTXDcFJN4,7415040,7423040,with a voice that sounds like martha  stewart  [Laughter]  it's a good thing well i called you
3gmTXDcFJN4,7423040,7429440,though you want to know why oh yeah  why'd you call me  i have lots of faith people who request
3gmTXDcFJN4,7429440,7435280,to be my friend on facebook  and they're people that i don't really  know personally there may be people that
3gmTXDcFJN4,7435280,7442960,have seen these comments well i would  you know this is  so it's a different  uh answer for just a normal person who
3gmTXDcFJN4,7442960,7450960,doesn't have a  a profession that puts him in front of  an audience but  for you your facebook is a business is a
3gmTXDcFJN4,7450960,7458159,business generator  yeah and i'm just wondering is there a  hazard to either me or the people that i
3gmTXDcFJN4,7458159,7463520,friend  and friending people or can i just willy  nilly no let them all let them all
3gmTXDcFJN4,7463520,7470159,friend you the the the only hazard  there's several hazards on facebook  obviously but you're in control of those
3gmTXDcFJN4,7470159,7475280,hazards first of all of course you're  giving them information about you which  they sell in advertising that's a
3gmTXDcFJN4,7475280,7481599,minimal hazard i mean that's just life  that's how you pay for it it's a free  service  i wouldn't worry too much about that
3gmTXDcFJN4,7481599,7487040,especially for if you're the world's  oldest comedian i don't think that's  going to be a risk for you
3gmTXDcFJN4,7487040,7492719,but but uh and then there's the bigger  hazard which is uh malware don't click
3gmTXDcFJN4,7492719,7499920,be careful about clicking links from  strangers  uh you know what happens to people on  facebook you might even see this you get
3gmTXDcFJN4,7499920,7507199,an email from or a facebook message from  somebody says wow  uh lou i had no idea you were such a
3gmTXDcFJN4,7507199,7512400,wild man  what were you doing last night do you  want to see the video
3gmTXDcFJN4,7512400,7517679,and and you go wait a minute what i was  at home last night i was in my van down  by the river
3gmTXDcFJN4,7517679,7525280,what happened so there's a link on that  message a warning  to your listeners is i got an email
3gmTXDcFJN4,7525280,7530320,supposedly from facebook saying  uh you know this is your code to get
3gmTXDcFJN4,7530320,7535480,back your account exactly suspended
3gmTXDcFJN4,7540320,7546159,yeah if it asks you for a password don't  yeah and so this the problem with this  email that says what did you did last
3gmTXDcFJN4,7546159,7552480,night here's the video you click the  link  it looks like a normal video link but it  doesn't play it says oh your flash is
3gmTXDcFJN4,7552480,7558560,out of date or your software's out of  they download the new updater and you go  well yeah i really got to find out what  i did last night so you download the
3gmTXDcFJN4,7558560,7564079,updater but it's not an updater it's  malware yeah so be very careful about  clicking links
3gmTXDcFJN4,7564079,7571040,uh it's fine to talk to people you don't  know on facebook you know it's no worse  than talking to people at your shows in
3gmTXDcFJN4,7571040,7576639,fact i think for you this is a valuable  publicity tool i think uh i know a lot
3gmTXDcFJN4,7576639,7583440,of comics for whom facebook is their  number one  uh tool for building audience so go
3gmTXDcFJN4,7583440,7589440,ahead and have a great show lou  space coming up next
3gmTXDcFJN4,7589440,7596560,space  the final frontiers  these are the voyages of the starship
3gmTXDcFJN4,7596560,7602239,pile  we got to come up with a better act
3gmTXDcFJN4,7602239,7607679,you know if i get one of those messages  on facebook i just think to myself yeah  i don't care how bad the video is
3gmTXDcFJN4,7607679,7614639,because all pr is good pr  my life just isn't exciting enough yeah  to really put me over the edge yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,7614639,7620159,uh people want to stare at me glowering  with my double chin while i'm typing my  computer that's their problem i look at
3gmTXDcFJN4,7620159,7626560,my email these days and you know  half of it is phishing attempts it's  really remarkable well especially you
3gmTXDcFJN4,7626560,7632639,though because you're a public figure  maybe i don't think it's uh personally  targeting me but it's a lot of
3gmTXDcFJN4,7632639,7638079,oh you know uh this is your bank  chase which i don't have an account with
3gmTXDcFJN4,7638079,7644800,uh  somebody trying to log in you better uh  you know we're or we're gonna cancel  your thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,7644800,7650480,if you don't log in and stuff like that  uh you know i know it's fake but it's  it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,7650480,7656880,i think for somebody who's not prepared  for the uh  depth to which bad guys will go
3gmTXDcFJN4,7656880,7663679,it's kind of a shocker  i miss all my nigerian princes no i  still get those they're trust funds
3gmTXDcFJN4,7663679,7669760,i still get and they must work or they  wouldn't send them because it costs  something yeah but not much
3gmTXDcFJN4,7669760,7675679,yeah it doesn't have to work more than 1  000 or 1 in 10 thousand or a hundred  thousand because
3gmTXDcFJN4,7675679,7681040,you know  soccer is coming on today because he was
3gmTXDcFJN4,7681040,7686880,doing something yesterday  oh cool and he said well uh can i come  on sunday i said well you sure can
3gmTXDcFJN4,7686880,7692719,because rod's at the half past and you  could be at the corner of and yeah yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,7692719,7698000,oh that's great yeah  i'm gonna hang around yeah i don't think  we're gonna get any more calls
3gmTXDcFJN4,7698000,7703520,unfortunately because  we got we got stuff we got people
3gmTXDcFJN4,7703520,7710320,got programming ah  yeah you know it coming  yeah i filled now every hour with at
3gmTXDcFJN4,7710320,7715679,least one with a one at least one  contributor now  i'm wondering if i've over if i have i
3gmTXDcFJN4,7715679,7722160,overdone it  but it's fun isn't it i it's great i  think because it adds variety and
3gmTXDcFJN4,7722160,7729679,[Music]  if it's just calls you know the the  quality of the contributors is higher  quality both in content and audio
3gmTXDcFJN4,7729679,7737840,so i feel like that's and you know you  can kind of look ahead to oh i really  like this guy or that guy and
3gmTXDcFJN4,7737840,7743360,so  well you've got a great crew you know i  mean the people that you've selected for  this
3gmTXDcFJN4,7743360,7749760,i'll include myself  all right  you know bring bring along the taste  that's exactly right yeah i find it so
3gmTXDcFJN4,7749760,7755920,appealing yeah  and dick's a hoot  oh i love dick i love them all you're
3gmTXDcFJN4,7755920,7760960,all my  buddies my buds  man i remember when i got locked out of
3gmTXDcFJN4,7760960,7766239,yahoo mail oh it's time isn't it  i remember when i got yacked out locked
3gmTXDcFJN4,7766239,7772079,out of you  i so i i was working at caltech and i i  you know i had very little time to mess
3gmTXDcFJN4,7772079,7777520,with this it was urgent so you know you  try getting a hold of yahoo good luck  nothing happens
3gmTXDcFJN4,7777520,7783679,so i finally called pac bell because  apparently the issue was i've been with  yahoo a long time and it's when they
3gmTXDcFJN4,7783679,7789440,detach from pac bell  that a bunch of the emails got jammed up  so i actually reached a woman at pack
3gmTXDcFJN4,7789440,7794560,belt that said i'm not supposed to do  this but i'm gonna make some calls i'll  call you back and she solved the problem
3gmTXDcFJN4,7794560,7801040,for me  nice  yeah i mean that never happens right i  was like can i send you something nice
3gmTXDcFJN4,7801040,7807280,she said nah we can't take gifts but  thanks for the thought but she was my  hero man
3gmTXDcFJN4,7807280,7812639,not to be repeated i'm sure yeah you  only get one hero  yeah that's it
3gmTXDcFJN4,7812639,7817760,you got one hero now you're done yep  [Laughter]
3gmTXDcFJN4,7817760,7822960,all right i am  going to
3gmTXDcFJN4,7822960,7829000,fire up old elton sir elton  okay
3gmTXDcFJN4,7829840,7835760,he's our rocket guy rod pyle author of  space 2.0 editor-in-chief of atastra
3gmTXDcFJN4,7835760,7842639,magazine at  space.nss.org he keeps us in touch with  the things happening out
3gmTXDcFJN4,7842639,7848719,there hello rod hey how are you did you  see the mars uh rover that it was
3gmTXDcFJN4,7848719,7854480,running windows 98  that's getting its first update
3gmTXDcFJN4,7855440,7860480,uh we know better than that  running linux i would i would think well
3gmTXDcFJN4,7860480,7867360,let me see if i can find that story uh  but uh yeah  uh everybody sent it to me
3gmTXDcFJN4,7867360,7873840,uh  yeah i mean it's it's a little weird  here from windows 98 to mars 22 this 20
3gmTXDcFJN4,7873840,7879920,oh year old spaceship the mars express  just got uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,7879920,7885679,the mar the mar it's the europeans it's  esa yeah  it's a european space agency it's their
3gmTXDcFJN4,7885679,7891440,lowest cost and most successful mission  19 years after its launch
3gmTXDcFJN4,7891440,7899199,the mars advanced radar for subsurface  and ionic  i'm sorry ionosphere exounding marxists
3gmTXDcFJN4,7899199,7905040,it's an instrument on the mars express  is finally getting an update it was  running because it was launched 20 years
3gmTXDcFJN4,7905040,7910400,ago  windows 98  oh my god we know nasa doesn't
3gmTXDcFJN4,7910400,7915679,we don't  no nasa doesn't i'd have to check on isa  but i'd be surprised because
3gmTXDcFJN4,7915679,7921920,those chips as we've talked about before  are pretty old designs because they've  all been vetted for radiation  environments and what a waste of
3gmTXDcFJN4,7921920,7929119,overhead it would be to be running  windows and they'd be better off running  dos  or cpm or something yeah i'm kind of
3gmTXDcFJN4,7929119,7935280,it's kind of surprising  i'll check that out yeah it's  interesting  uh
3gmTXDcFJN4,7935280,7943199,esa mars express scientist colin wilson  says it really is like having a brand  new instrument on board mars express
3gmTXDcFJN4,7943199,7949280,almost 20 years after launch  until all those windows pop up asking me  if i want to clean my system yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,7949280,7955119,exactly windows 98 it must have been  like an embedded version of windows or
3gmTXDcFJN4,7955119,7960719,something i can't imagine it was the  consumer  version of windows 9 they wouldn't do  that so they would all do that to
3gmTXDcFJN4,7960719,7966159,themselves anyway what's up in the world  so hey so that's a cool story you can be
3gmTXDcFJN4,7966159,7973199,you too can be a citizen science hero so  a new program called the jovian vortex  hunter which is what a great name you
3gmTXDcFJN4,7973199,7980159,could make a whole tv show just on that  has been launched and it invites the  public to aid nasa and their affiliates
3gmTXDcFJN4,7980159,7987599,in researching jupiter's atmosphere  so you remember the juno probe it's been  up there since 2016 orbiting jupiter
3gmTXDcFJN4,7987599,7994079,and a big part of its mission was  measuring jupiter's gravitational field  and so forth but they did put a camera
3gmTXDcFJN4,7994079,8000560,on it  and originally it was not expected to do  a whole lot it was kind of a citizen  outreach tool but it ended up being very
3gmTXDcFJN4,8000560,8006079,valuable for research they thought it  was only going to last a few years but  and go out in 2017 because of all the
3gmTXDcFJN4,8006079,8012400,radiation but it's still going  so nasa in the southwest southwest  research institute got together with a
3gmTXDcFJN4,8012400,8019119,site called zuniverse i sent you the  link i think so maybe oh i have no video  yes yes yes yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,8019119,8026560,and so you can go log on to that site  and sign up and read some instructions  and download the copious imagery from
3gmTXDcFJN4,8026560,8032800,that camera looking down at jupiter's  surface well not the surface the cloud  tops  and they're looking for people to help
3gmTXDcFJN4,8032800,8039920,identify vortex patterns that look like  little hurricanes or cyclones  to help them cull through these tens of
3gmTXDcFJN4,8039920,8045679,thousands of images  so they can figure out more about how  the upper atmosphere works and therefore
3gmTXDcFJN4,8045679,8051440,intuit how the lower atmosphere works so  is this this isn't just a stunt this  they really want people to circle the
3gmTXDcFJN4,8051440,8057119,vortex  yeah so this is really because sometimes  you see the stuff it's like ah that's  kid stuff you know they just want to get
3gmTXDcFJN4,8057119,8062239,people engaged this is no they need help  because the crew at southwest research  institute
3gmTXDcFJN4,8062239,8068800,and uh the people operating the camera  is called malin mike malen systems  you know they're very small units at
3gmTXDcFJN4,8068800,8074960,this point and they  because they didn't plan for the camera  to last as long right so they said well  we got all this data it's going to take
3gmTXDcFJN4,8074960,8081440,us years but if we can get citizens  involved in helping identify this stuff  we can figure out what's going on which
3gmTXDcFJN4,8081440,8088400,is neat this is the kind of thing a  computer could do pretty well  maybe they just don't have that
3gmTXDcFJN4,8088400,8093440,the computer hardware to do it  it may be a matter of horsepower and it
3gmTXDcFJN4,8093440,8099599,may be a matter of just wanting to  engage the public more but i do think  there's a um a good human component
3gmTXDcFJN4,8099599,8104840,they've got 760 volunteers already  it's easy to go to the website
3gmTXDcFJN4,8104840,8109920,zoonaverse.org and  sign up to be a jovian voytic center
3gmTXDcFJN4,8109920,8115040,it doesn't look that hard really you can  pretty much tell  what a vortex looks like in a turbulent
3gmTXDcFJN4,8115040,8122960,region cloud bands are a little harder  um i don't know what do you think is  there a vortex here is that a vortex
3gmTXDcFJN4,8122960,8128239,i don't know it doesn't look like one  it's a circle but i haven't i haven't  gone through my training yet yeah you
3gmTXDcFJN4,8128239,8133360,know yeah and you can switch to a dark  theme so it makes it a little easier to  see there we go
3gmTXDcFJN4,8133360,8139599,you know  this kind of thing actually probably  does work better than machine  intelligence if you get enough people
3gmTXDcFJN4,8139599,8147360,doing it maybe you've got a hundred  different people looking at the same  image  and if 76 said that's a vortex i bet you
3gmTXDcFJN4,8147360,8153360,that's a very high accuracy rate much  better that's one of the things they  talked about is is you know comparing
3gmTXDcFJN4,8153360,8159199,the the the numbers as they come in so  right i just think it's a cool way to  get involved because i remember i met
3gmTXDcFJN4,8159199,8165119,mike malen years ago and he's developed  the cameras that went on  almost all the mars spacecraft and now
3gmTXDcFJN4,8165119,8170239,this outer solar system mission  it's just a brilliant guy well and  they're backlogged i mean these are
3gmTXDcFJN4,8170239,8176800,pictures from 2018 we're looking at  right right  so um so that's really cool
3gmTXDcFJN4,8176800,8183920,and i think it's a great idea they  probably got tired of looking at them  oh yeah well you know those guys are
3gmTXDcFJN4,8183920,8190000,pretty dedicated and there was a guy  working with him who spent you know a  year and a half going through just
3gmTXDcFJN4,8190000,8197040,pictures of the martian surface but  you're kind of exploring at that  resolution i guess you're looking for  caves well it's fun and so forth yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,8197040,8202478,yeah and it's exciting because it's a  chance to do that without having to sit  in a classroom and get a phd in
3gmTXDcFJN4,8202478,8209280,planetary geology yeah  speaking of planets yes  if we get up in the wee hours of the
3gmTXDcFJN4,8209280,8214399,morning anytime between about three and  five and go outside and look to the east  in the predawn sky
3gmTXDcFJN4,8214399,8220478,you will be able to see five planets  clustered there which only happens about  every 18 years
3gmTXDcFJN4,8220478,8225760,so  mars venus jupiter and saturn will be  easily evident mercury comes up last
3gmTXDcFJN4,8225760,8232080,just before sunrise it's a little harder  to spot  but those are all naked eye objects  better with binoculars or a telescope of
3gmTXDcFJN4,8232080,8238880,course if you have a telescope or really  go to the pair of binoculars you can  spot uranus and neptune as well
3gmTXDcFJN4,8238880,8244638,and the crescent moon will be joining  them a couple of days so this is really  that's very cool wonderful you know you
3gmTXDcFJN4,8244638,8251200,love these these these moments of  incredible nature right it's it's a  little bit like a solar eclipse so i'm
3gmTXDcFJN4,8251200,8257280,gonna get up tomorrow morning  and try and figure out how to look to  the east past all the condos that's  around me
3gmTXDcFJN4,8257280,8263359,and uh  that's a condo  yeah well there's a lot of that here
3gmTXDcFJN4,8263359,8269678,and space.com just announced they're  seeking images taken by  us the readers so if if you do find
3gmTXDcFJN4,8269678,8275518,something that you you like and you make  a happy snap that turns out  well you can send it to space photos at
3gmTXDcFJN4,8275518,8280558,space.com partner in the podcast that's  really uh really cool
3gmTXDcFJN4,8280558,8286319,isn't it um  oh and if you can't see it it's online  so you just do a search for
3gmTXDcFJN4,8286319,8292240,planetary i remember  when you know it's you see the moon and
3gmTXDcFJN4,8292240,8298960,uh  is it venus align a lot right you see  the two of them kind of like two little  stars hanging in the sky venus is the
3gmTXDcFJN4,8298960,8304960,brightest yeah next  and so i remember when my daughter was  little getting her up and saying look
3gmTXDcFJN4,8304960,8312319,there's the moon and that's and that's  venus that's just good for about three  minutes right said dad
3gmTXDcFJN4,8312638,8320160,it's kind of like no you know it's funny  maybe it's that particular bond that  father and daughter have but to this day
3gmTXDcFJN4,8320160,8325678,25 years later she remembers it she'll  bring it up she'll say i remember that  night you got me up to see so it's a
3gmTXDcFJN4,8325678,8331518,good this is a good thing to do with  your kids it gives them a it's great  yeah yeah i used to take my son out to
3gmTXDcFJN4,8331518,8338399,meteor showers and he still remembers  and asks when are we going out to see a  meteor shower it's a great bonding go  out the desert or the mountains and yeah
3gmTXDcFJN4,8338399,8344478,so the best time is quiet evening right  before dawn is when you'll see the the  most stars go online and look at what
3gmTXDcFJN4,8344478,8350160,you're going to be looking for because  that'll give you some idea because it's  not exactly i mean there's other things  up there

3gmTXDcFJN4,8481680,8487600,i had a fun thing pepcom had another  live event last week  and
3gmTXDcFJN4,8487600,8493520,these are the  these are like the  kind of trade shows but they're small so  you get to see
3gmTXDcFJN4,8493520,8498960,a small number of gizmos and gadgets but  there's often without huge crowds
3gmTXDcFJN4,8498960,8504000,yeah and good food  small well not so much
3gmTXDcFJN4,8504000,8510319,because of covert now everything is in a  little box oh that's no fun no more  chocolate fountains huh
3gmTXDcFJN4,8510319,8517200,no no  many is the time dick and i have  wandered  the food tables
3gmTXDcFJN4,8517200,8523120,at a pepcom event  chowing down on tiny burgers while  laughing at products
3gmTXDcFJN4,8523120,8529280,i know well i remember that you said  that the focus of this is terrible i  said leo your chocolate covered the
3gmTXDcFJN4,8529280,8534319,webcam i mean it was  a scary kind of thing
3gmTXDcFJN4,8534319,8542080,so what do you what did you find you  know leo uh i read about this but i  never saw it in persons it's the kodak
3gmTXDcFJN4,8542080,8549840,reels  which is the eight millimeter and super  eight  digital converter for your old movies
3gmTXDcFJN4,8549840,8556960,it's funny we were talking about film  photography with chris marquart last  hour  you know 50 years ago uh oh i'm sorry go
3gmTXDcFJN4,8556960,8565200,ahead well i was just saying somebody  was saying how do i convert my eight  millimeter film  oh well great and 50 years ago i kept a
3gmTXDcFJN4,8565200,8571280,video a video an 8 mil millimeter camera  in the prop room i know i've seen people
3gmTXDcFJN4,8571280,8577600,you had amazing films that you shot  backstage at the match game with betty  white and also in fact you made them
3gmTXDcFJN4,8577600,8583600,like you were trying to make a murder  mystery with betty white oh we made a  musical a musical okay yeah i thought
3gmTXDcFJN4,8583600,8589600,you murdered the score and that's why i  thought it was a murder mystery no i  murdered the script
3gmTXDcFJN4,8590240,8597040,so when i had to send the videos away to  have them translated or digitized i was
3gmTXDcFJN4,8597040,8603040,so worried i called the company and  explained and the guy said give me the  fedex number send it overnight first
3gmTXDcFJN4,8603040,8611200,thing i'll be here i will personally  scan these myself  and if i can look at them you can have
3gmTXDcFJN4,8611200,8617760,the digital copy for free i should feel  free wow  take a look at them so the kodak reels
3gmTXDcFJN4,8617760,8622880,is a way for you to do it at home okay  so it does the old three four five and
3gmTXDcFJN4,8622880,8628800,seven inch super eight and eight  millimeter you feed it into
3gmTXDcFJN4,8628800,8634160,it's almost like threading a projector  it looks like a little injector with but  without the light
3gmTXDcFJN4,8634160,8640000,exactly exactly and then there's an 8.8  little megapixel sensor in there now you
3gmTXDcFJN4,8640000,8645280,don't watch it at first because it takes  two seconds per frame
3gmTXDcFJN4,8645280,8651439,so the lady said if you have a little  reel of film it's probably going to take  two hours for this to do this overnight
3gmTXDcFJN4,8651439,8657120,or something  exactly but there's an sd card in there  and then she showed me she brought up on
3gmTXDcFJN4,8657120,8664560,the screen 10 videos that they had done  you can watch them on this if you want  it's a 5-inch screen but then it has a
3gmTXDcFJN4,8664560,8669680,usb out so you can hook it up to a  computer or your big screen tv but you
3gmTXDcFJN4,8669680,8675040,also have a great way to cart so you can  transfer it over and burn a dvd or  whatever that's it
3gmTXDcFJN4,8675040,8681439,exactly exactly and that way you don't  have to worry that the video is left  especially videos you can't replace that
3gmTXDcFJN4,8681439,8689280,left your house yeah here you are at the  kodak booth  uh shooting this on super eight i hope
3gmTXDcFJN4,8689280,8696560,yes  i did i did and we dubbed the sound and  later yeah there it is it's pretty neat  so uh so is there a kodak anymore i
3gmTXDcFJN4,8696560,8703680,thought they  you know what i  there there is a kodak i met someone who  was at the real kodak it's small a small
3gmTXDcFJN4,8703680,8710720,group up in rochester but mainly they  licensed their name out to different  companies okay yeah so this is some
3gmTXDcFJN4,8710720,8716560,other company that makes this  i believe this is not one of the  original people yeah but still
3gmTXDcFJN4,8716560,8723040,cool you know  yeah and also they do keep track of how  well built everything is because it's
3gmTXDcFJN4,8723040,8729359,that's their brand yeah they auto yeah  and you know a lot of this film that  they're scanning is old kodak eight
3gmTXDcFJN4,8729359,8736800,millimeter film  absolutely it's all in the family  yeah yes neat yeah so for those who
3gmTXDcFJN4,8736800,8743040,don't know uh dick he comes by and  visits us every week with a gadget or  something like that uh that he collects
3gmTXDcFJN4,8743040,8749840,in his  travels to sing-sing and elsewhere  this was not in sing-sing this this no
3gmTXDcFJN4,8749840,8757520,this is not this was in manhattan all  right  uh but you may not know that dick not  only was mad magazines and still is mad
3gmTXDcFJN4,8757520,8764800,magazine's you know uh  you know  writer  mads madison manager yeah and and a
3gmTXDcFJN4,8764800,8770080,member of the uh usual gang of idiots  uh which and i read you when i was a kid
3gmTXDcFJN4,8770080,8775200,my whole life i've been reading dick  debartolo's movie parodies and so forth  but he also was a writer on the match
3gmTXDcFJN4,8775200,8780399,game did you post the videos  that you know what they were they were
3gmTXDcFJN4,8780399,8788240,up for about oh a minute and a half  because all the me you know i dubbed a  track on it all the music was
3gmTXDcFJN4,8788240,8795840,so youtube took it down immediately i  took it down immediately i  i i used another catalog of a company i
3gmTXDcFJN4,8795840,8801120,used to work for and that got taken down  in two days because the company was sold
3gmTXDcFJN4,8801120,8806160,and they didn't recognize that they had  given me anyway
3gmTXDcFJN4,8806160,8813439,this is historic stuff i mean not just  betty white you had well who else did  you have on this oh van johnson uh kitty
3gmTXDcFJN4,8813439,8818800,carlisle  i mean just big names from tv in the 60s
3gmTXDcFJN4,8818800,8824560,but also movies  lauren bacall lauren  jay mansfield

3gmTXDcFJN4,8829840,8836080,those movies the movies  now you can by the way uh you can put it  the movies youtube didn't want you to
3gmTXDcFJN4,8836080,8842240,see  something that would be good yeah  it's a good selling point banned banned
3gmTXDcFJN4,8842240,8847600,on youtube  finally see  the
