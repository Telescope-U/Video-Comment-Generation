TfiFJwZJk84,25000,30000,"To find the root cause of what I am saying, we have to go a little back."
TfiFJwZJk84,30000,31000,When the Britishers were ruling in India.  
TfiFJwZJk84,31000,34000,"there were two major challenges for the East India Company,"
TfiFJwZJk84,34000,36000,"the first was communication with Indians,"
TfiFJwZJk84,36000,39000,"Second, they required workers and clerk"

TfiFJwZJk84,69000,73000,If your English is not good then it is called poor communication. 
TfiFJwZJk84,73000,77000,"Rather, not knowing English means you know some other language."
TfiFJwZJk84,77000,80000,5 years old IOS is also considered outdated in today's date.  
TfiFJwZJk84,80000,85000,"But such an important thing, our education system is still running in the same way"
TfiFJwZJk84,85000,87000,even today with a few changes.

TfiFJwZJk84,101000,103000,Now If you want to know anything 
TfiFJwZJk84,103000,107000,then you will find out from Google that you do not need to memorize so much.
TfiFJwZJk84,107000,110000,"And in a government school, English is a subject in every class, "
TfiFJwZJk84,110000,114000,"even after 12 years of studying English, people are not able to speak English "
TfiFJwZJk84,114000,117000,and a 5-year-old boy learns English without reading any book 
TfiFJwZJk84,117000,119000,because he gets that environment.  
TfiFJwZJk84,119000,126000,"( a + b )^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab  No one knows what is its use in real life, "

TfiFJwZJk84,155000,160000,"Everyone is taught the same syllabus and the same thing, without looking at their capabilities."
TfiFJwZJk84,160000,163000,And creativity doesn't have any importance.
TfiFJwZJk84,163000,171000,"If You keep lions, fish, snakes, elephants all in one line and tell them to climb up the tree.  "
TfiFJwZJk84,171000,174000,They will feel for the rest of their life's that they are not capable of anything.

TfiFJwZJk84,194000,196000,if the college provides extra courses  
TfiFJwZJk84,196000,198000,then the parents will not allow to choose them 
TfiFJwZJk84,198000,200000,So all that college money will be wasted.  
TfiFJwZJk84,200000,201000,"Now, from where the option will come"
TfiFJwZJk84,201000,204000,Your training starts from childhood itself.
TfiFJwZJk84,204000,207000,"Parents, brothers and sisters relatives, everyone explains this "

TfiFJwZJk84,255000,257000,"in all the departments of his company, "

TfiFJwZJk84,261000,264000,and it may also happen that he may not qualify
TfiFJwZJk84,264000,266000,for more than half the department education-wise 
TfiFJwZJk84,266000,271000,"But he can run the whole company, so why we don't talk about this skill."
TfiFJwZJk84,271000,275000,People spend more than 25% of their life in this current education system 
TfiFJwZJk84,275000,278000,so that they can go and fulfil the dreams of the companies owner 
TfiFJwZJk84,278000,280000,who are less educated than them  
TfiFJwZJk84,280000,283000,"If Indias Current Education System is that much good, "
TfiFJwZJk84,283000,288000,then why these celebrity and politicians are sending their children out for studies.  
TfiFJwZJk84,288000,293000,It should be compulsory for politicians that their children should study in 
TfiFJwZJk84,293000,295000,The government college of the area from which they win the election.

TfiFJwZJk84,314000,316000,"Ask them why you are preparing for a government job for such a long time, "
TfiFJwZJk84,316000,319000,then they all will say the same one thing and that is job security.
TfiFJwZJk84,319000,322000,Means you won't be fired even if you don't work.  
TfiFJwZJk84,322000,325000,All this is truancy 
TfiFJwZJk84,325000,330000,All this comes to our mind because our current education system does not give enough confidence 
TfiFJwZJk84,330000,334000,So that we can work by our skills power and we don't have to be afraid of being fired.
TfiFJwZJk84,334000,338000,I am not talking about the next 10 years but if I talk about the next 5 years 
TfiFJwZJk84,338000,342000,Then the technology will change so much that what we are studying today.
TfiFJwZJk84,342000,344000,the skill we are focusing on. 
TfiFJwZJk84,344000,346000,Don't know whether that will be relevant or not at that time.
