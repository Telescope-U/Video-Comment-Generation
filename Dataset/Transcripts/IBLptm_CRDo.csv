IBLptm_CRDo,2833,4708,It's very simple 
IBLptm_CRDo,4708,6000,"to get what you want, "
IBLptm_CRDo,6000,8333,but it's not easy.
IBLptm_CRDo,8333,10875,It's your job to make yourself 
IBLptm_CRDo,10875,13583,"do the crap you don't wanna do,"
IBLptm_CRDo,13583,15375,so you can be
IBLptm_CRDo,15375,16375,everything 
IBLptm_CRDo,16375,17791,that you're supposed to be.
IBLptm_CRDo,17791,21833,"And you're so damn busy waiting to feel like it,"
IBLptm_CRDo,21833,25708,and you're never going to.
IBLptm_CRDo,25708,29541,"Most of you guys are looking for the compromise,"
IBLptm_CRDo,29541,31583,"You're looking for the easier route,"
IBLptm_CRDo,31583,33708,you're looking for the corner to cut.
IBLptm_CRDo,33708,36791,And that is the whole in your bucket.
IBLptm_CRDo,36791,40458,Any single tiny hole will 
IBLptm_CRDo,40458,41583,ruin you 
IBLptm_CRDo,41583,44666,over time.
IBLptm_CRDo,44666,46833,There is no success without pain.
IBLptm_CRDo,46833,49250,There's no such thing as climbing to the top 
IBLptm_CRDo,49250,50958,obstacle free.
IBLptm_CRDo,50958,53625,There's nothing worth having in life 
IBLptm_CRDo,53625,55500,that doesn't have a big price tag on it.
IBLptm_CRDo,55500,58583,"Only those who are faithful and consistent,"
IBLptm_CRDo,58583,61375,"and do not give into their moods, "
IBLptm_CRDo,61375,62375,will make it.
IBLptm_CRDo,62375,63833,"We're all emotional creatures, I've got "
IBLptm_CRDo,63833,65208,"major emotions in my life,"
IBLptm_CRDo,65208,66750,but I don't listen to my feelings.
IBLptm_CRDo,66750,69041,"I just keep on going, I get up anyway,"
IBLptm_CRDo,69041,70750,"I do my job anyway,"
IBLptm_CRDo,70750,73625,"I do the best I know how, the very best I can,"
IBLptm_CRDo,73625,75958,and I mean to keep on doing it 
IBLptm_CRDo,75958,78458,to the end.
IBLptm_CRDo,78458,79583,"Easy choices, "
IBLptm_CRDo,79583,80583,hard life. 
IBLptm_CRDo,80583,81833,"Hard choices, "
IBLptm_CRDo,81833,82708,easy life.
IBLptm_CRDo,82708,84875,"What we most fear doing,"
IBLptm_CRDo,84875,85750,"asking,"
IBLptm_CRDo,85750,86625,"saying, "
IBLptm_CRDo,86625,87750,these are very often 
IBLptm_CRDo,87750,90083,exactly what we most need to do.
IBLptm_CRDo,90083,94250,The roads and power is in taking responsibility.
IBLptm_CRDo,94250,95416,Your life 
IBLptm_CRDo,95416,97125,is your responsibility
IBLptm_CRDo,97125,98875,and your responsibility
IBLptm_CRDo,98875,102333,alone.
IBLptm_CRDo,102333,103875,It takes real time 
IBLptm_CRDo,103875,105916,and real commitment
IBLptm_CRDo,105916,108666,and it takes that every single day.
IBLptm_CRDo,108666,110583,It takes a conscious effort to be more valuable
IBLptm_CRDo,110583,112375,"to be better than the next guy,"
IBLptm_CRDo,112375,113416,every single day.
IBLptm_CRDo,113416,115291,And that sh*t is not easy.
IBLptm_CRDo,115291,117000,Commit yourself to 15 years 
IBLptm_CRDo,117000,119500,"commit yourself to 20 years,"
IBLptm_CRDo,119500,121750,Quit looking for the overnight success
IBLptm_CRDo,121750,122750,focus down
IBLptm_CRDo,122750,123708,lock down
IBLptm_CRDo,123708,126000,commit to something for 10 f*cking years
IBLptm_CRDo,126000,127416,to be great at it
IBLptm_CRDo,127416,128375,and guess what? 
IBLptm_CRDo,128375,129875,Wherever you are in 10 years 
IBLptm_CRDo,129875,132250,is gonna be a hell of a lot better than where you are now.
IBLptm_CRDo,132250,134291,"The is no quick way, there is no easy way"
IBLptm_CRDo,134291,136541,"and the only motherf*ckers that win long-term, are the ones "
IBLptm_CRDo,136541,138000,that are willing to do the sh*t 
IBLptm_CRDo,138000,139541,that they know they need to do 
IBLptm_CRDo,139541,142916,when they don't feel like f*cking doing it.
IBLptm_CRDo,142916,144750,"If you don't fix the hole, "
IBLptm_CRDo,144750,146625,"if you don't improve your skill,"
IBLptm_CRDo,146625,149208,"if you don't do everything you can, "
IBLptm_CRDo,149208,151458,"if you don't stop cutting corners, "
IBLptm_CRDo,151458,153500,"stop taking it easy,"
IBLptm_CRDo,153500,155541,stop letting that little voice 
IBLptm_CRDo,155541,157708,"win the f*cking war in your brain, "
IBLptm_CRDo,157708,160583,"that says ""Tomorrow, I'll start Monday."
IBLptm_CRDo,160583,162458,"You know, it's not that big of a deal."
IBLptm_CRDo,162458,164540,"You know what? Give yourself a break."""
IBLptm_CRDo,164541,167375,"If you don't silence that f*cking voice,"
IBLptm_CRDo,167375,168916,you will lose everything.
IBLptm_CRDo,168916,171250,No holes in the bucket.
IBLptm_CRDo,171250,172791,"No compromise,"
IBLptm_CRDo,172791,174250,no exceptions 
IBLptm_CRDo,174250,175208,ever.
IBLptm_CRDo,201833,205625,You're going to hit a wall.
IBLptm_CRDo,205625,207750,A lot of people ladies and gentlemen don't come out here
IBLptm_CRDo,207750,211791,because they don't want to hit the wall.
IBLptm_CRDo,211791,214791,"Everybody hits the wall,"
IBLptm_CRDo,214791,216375,No one's exempt.
IBLptm_CRDo,216375,218791,"There's a period, let me tell you how it goes"
IBLptm_CRDo,218791,222208,"When things are going real good when you first start off,"
IBLptm_CRDo,222208,224375,life is playing with you.
IBLptm_CRDo,224375,226208,"You're going to be going and things are looking great,"
IBLptm_CRDo,226208,228458,"and you're excited and you gonna tell everybody about it, "
IBLptm_CRDo,228458,231833,and then all of a sudden you hit a wall.
IBLptm_CRDo,231833,234333,And that wall stuns some people.
IBLptm_CRDo,234333,237165,That wall knock the life out of some people.
IBLptm_CRDo,237166,239625,That wall discourages some people. 
IBLptm_CRDo,239625,242041,"It didn't work out for them, they hit the wall "
IBLptm_CRDo,242041,243958,and they turned around. 
IBLptm_CRDo,243958,246458,The wall is painful. 
IBLptm_CRDo,246458,248708,It's painful hitting that wall. 
IBLptm_CRDo,248708,250458,"And I'm saying to you, "
IBLptm_CRDo,250458,252165,all of us 
IBLptm_CRDo,252166,255541,will hit the wall. 
IBLptm_CRDo,255541,257500,"Bcause we all going to hit that wall,"
IBLptm_CRDo,257500,259208,We're all going to hit opposition.
IBLptm_CRDo,259208,261375,We're all going to hit that adversity.
IBLptm_CRDo,261375,263250,But I think we all know at the core
IBLptm_CRDo,263250,265083,it's never about what happens to you.
IBLptm_CRDo,265083,266625,It's about how you respond to it.
IBLptm_CRDo,266625,268375,You can control that.
IBLptm_CRDo,268375,272041,Like people are resilient.
IBLptm_CRDo,272041,272916,"Like, resilient "
IBLptm_CRDo,272916,274750,got the fortitude
IBLptm_CRDo,274750,276375,"that you put a goal in front of them,"
IBLptm_CRDo,276375,277208,"they'll smash it,"
IBLptm_CRDo,277208,278083,they'll chase it down.
IBLptm_CRDo,278083,279791,People are resilient.
IBLptm_CRDo,279791,281541,"Like when you put goals in front of them, "
IBLptm_CRDo,281541,283916,"they chase it. Resilient, right?"
IBLptm_CRDo,283916,286957,"And if you're resilient, you'll get whatever you're looking  for."
IBLptm_CRDo,286958,289250,If you're resilient.
IBLptm_CRDo,289250,291541,"And if you keep on hitting that wall, "
IBLptm_CRDo,291541,294625,here's what happens to you; 
IBLptm_CRDo,294625,299083,that you will have an incredible breakthrough. 
IBLptm_CRDo,299083,302333,"And it's as if the universe says, "
IBLptm_CRDo,302333,304791,"""Let's help him out. "
IBLptm_CRDo,304791,307707,I admire that kind of tenacity. 
IBLptm_CRDo,307708,310000,"let's give her a hand."" "
IBLptm_CRDo,310000,311708,As you're working times 
IBLptm_CRDo,311708,315250,with tears falling down your face. 
IBLptm_CRDo,315250,316583,And you'll look back on the times 
IBLptm_CRDo,316583,318958,and you will cherish those times. 
IBLptm_CRDo,318958,322125,Because what you become in the process 
IBLptm_CRDo,322125,323875,"if you hang in there, "
IBLptm_CRDo,323875,326250,"when you come through that valley, "
IBLptm_CRDo,326250,329125,"when you come through that fight, "
IBLptm_CRDo,329125,332250,there will be a look in your eyes that everybody will know 
IBLptm_CRDo,332250,336750,this is a different person here.
IBLptm_CRDo,336750,341583,No matter what you face
IBLptm_CRDo,341583,346958,No matter how bad it is going to be.
IBLptm_CRDo,346958,351916,"When there is a challenge, any challenge, "
IBLptm_CRDo,351916,353291,"anything that you're facing, "
IBLptm_CRDo,353291,360375,the only way to overcome the challenges that you face.
IBLptm_CRDo,360375,366625,is to start walking.
IBLptm_CRDo,366625,368958,"Winston Churchill said, and I quote,"
IBLptm_CRDo,368958,373083,Success is going from failure
IBLptm_CRDo,373083,376541,to failure to failure 
IBLptm_CRDo,376541,379875,without a loss of enthusiasm.
IBLptm_CRDo,379875,382708,"Doesn't matter if you win, that's not success."
IBLptm_CRDo,382708,384291,The success is going from the failure
IBLptm_CRDo,384291,385500,"to the failure to the failure,"
IBLptm_CRDo,385500,387625,and still being excited to show up.
IBLptm_CRDo,387625,390083,"It's like, this is how I likened success."
IBLptm_CRDo,390083,391541,"Success is like love, "
IBLptm_CRDo,391541,393332,"you know, the beautiful part about love"
IBLptm_CRDo,393333,394958,getting the sh*t kicked out of you
IBLptm_CRDo,394958,401875,and then coming back or more.
IBLptm_CRDo,401875,403916,Say this to yourself every day: 
IBLptm_CRDo,403916,406041,It's not over until I will. 
IBLptm_CRDo,406041,408332,It's not over until I get through. 
IBLptm_CRDo,408333,409875,"It's not over until I get over, "
IBLptm_CRDo,409875,412583,not over until I get what I want. 
IBLptm_CRDo,412583,414625,That's how you gotta do that. 
IBLptm_CRDo,414625,416291,"You've got to have that kind of courage, "
IBLptm_CRDo,416291,418707,that type of determination. 
IBLptm_CRDo,418708,420791,"If you wanna make it happen, "
IBLptm_CRDo,420791,425457,it's you.
IBLptm_CRDo,431916,435166,"At moments where I'm bone tired, "
IBLptm_CRDo,435166,437207,I have that clarity.
IBLptm_CRDo,437208,438791,And when you have the clarity 
IBLptm_CRDo,438791,441500,"and you know where you're trying to go,"
IBLptm_CRDo,441500,444000,"Then it becomes clear about what you have to train at, "
IBLptm_CRDo,444000,444625,what are the things
IBLptm_CRDo,444625,445791,you have to train into yourself.
IBLptm_CRDo,445791,446875,But the only way to do that is 
IBLptm_CRDo,446875,448583,to have a self-esteem that's built
IBLptm_CRDo,448583,450500,entirely around being the learner.
IBLptm_CRDo,450500,452000,Why?
IBLptm_CRDo,452000,453416,"Because you get the shot to the head, "
IBLptm_CRDo,453416,454707,the nugget of gold at your feet.
IBLptm_CRDo,454708,457500,It says you suck at this.
IBLptm_CRDo,457500,458500,"That hurts, man."
IBLptm_CRDo,458500,459416,That's hard to own.
IBLptm_CRDo,459416,460957,It's hard to face.
IBLptm_CRDo,460958,462666,And there's a thousand voices in your mind 
IBLptm_CRDo,462666,464957,telling you all the reasons why it's somebody else's fault
IBLptm_CRDo,464958,466875,and it's not your fault.
IBLptm_CRDo,466875,468625,But the reality is the moment you do that.
IBLptm_CRDo,468625,469583,You're giving away your power 
IBLptm_CRDo,469583,473750,because you're not looking for a way.
IBLptm_CRDo,473750,476416,"Remember, between where you are and where you want to go,"
IBLptm_CRDo,476416,479125,It is a gap of skill set.
IBLptm_CRDo,479125,481083,The things that you do and that you don't do
IBLptm_CRDo,481083,485000,are far more important than you think.
IBLptm_CRDo,485000,486041,And so if you act that
IBLptm_CRDo,486041,489875,the terror of realizing that is that it actually starts to  matter 
IBLptm_CRDo,489875,490583,what you do.
IBLptm_CRDo,490583,492166,"And you might say, well, that's better"
IBLptm_CRDo,492166,494125,than living a meaningless existence.
IBLptm_CRDo,494125,495958,It's better for it to matter.
IBLptm_CRDo,495958,497666,"But I mean, if you really ask yourself,"
IBLptm_CRDo,497666,500000,would you be so sure if you had the choice?
IBLptm_CRDo,500000,502833,I can live with no responsibility whatsoever.
IBLptm_CRDo,502833,505916,The price I pay is like nothing matters
IBLptm_CRDo,505916,508875,"or I can reverse it and everything matters, "
IBLptm_CRDo,508875,513416,but I have to take the responsibility that's associated with  that.
IBLptm_CRDo,513416,514708,It's not so obvious to me 
IBLptm_CRDo,514708,518000,that people would take the meaningful path.
IBLptm_CRDo,518000,519625,"All my belief systems have collapsed,"
IBLptm_CRDo,519625,521708,"It's like, yeah, maybe, "
IBLptm_CRDo,521708,523166,maybe you've just allowed them to collapse 
IBLptm_CRDo,523166,526500,because it's a lot easier than acting them out.
IBLptm_CRDo,526500,529916,Do great things while they are still small.
IBLptm_CRDo,529916,533250,"The Sage, the Sage "
IBLptm_CRDo,533250,536750,does not attempt anything very big 
IBLptm_CRDo,536750,540208,and thus achieve greatness.
IBLptm_CRDo,540208,543291,Greatness comes from being in the moment 
IBLptm_CRDo,543291,546791,here present in the now.
IBLptm_CRDo,546791,550291,"the stage confronts difficulties,"
IBLptm_CRDo,550291,553708,but never experiences down.
IBLptm_CRDo,553708,557500,This is the idea of thinking small.
IBLptm_CRDo,557500,559666,"And finally, "
IBLptm_CRDo,559666,562333,I'd like to see you change on this thought 
IBLptm_CRDo,562333,566208,change from seeing yourself as separate
IBLptm_CRDo,566208,571458,to seeing yourself as connected to everyone and everything 
IBLptm_CRDo,571458,573125,in the universe. 
IBLptm_CRDo,573125,575625,"Only thing you need to know right now, "
IBLptm_CRDo,575625,578166,"the point is not to avoid the pain, "
IBLptm_CRDo,578166,580041,to stop asking themselves.
IBLptm_CRDo,580041,582833,What's the least you can do to get good.
IBLptm_CRDo,582833,584416,And you need to start asking yourself 
IBLptm_CRDo,584416,587833,what's the most you can bear to become great?
