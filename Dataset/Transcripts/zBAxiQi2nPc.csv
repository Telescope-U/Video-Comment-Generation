zBAxiQi2nPc,39,3460,"- We have looked at a lot of ballin' GPU over the years,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,3460,5230,whether it's the six titan views we had
zBAxiQi2nPc,5230,6640,"for the six editor's project,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,6640,10417,"three GV100 Quadras for 12K Ultrawide gaming,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,10417,13170,"or even this unreleased mining GPU,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,13170,14420,the CMP 170 HX.
zBAxiQi2nPc,15498,17274,There are not a lot of cards out there
zBAxiQi2nPc,17274,19242,that we have not been able to get our hands on
zBAxiQi2nPc,19242,20670,"in one way or another,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,20670,22614,except for one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,22614,23982,"Until now,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,23982,25842,"the Nvidia A100,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,25842,28722,"this is their absolute top dog,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,28722,31879,"AI enterprise high performance compute,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,31879,33619,"big data analytics monster,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,33619,37026,and they refused to send it to me.
zBAxiQi2nPc,37026,39732,"Well, I got one anyway Nvidia,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,39732,41149,"so, deal with it."
zBAxiQi2nPc,42066,44574,"Just like everyone's gotta deal with my segues,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,44574,47560,smart deploy provides out of the box windows imaging support
zBAxiQi2nPc,47560,49584,"for over 1,500 computer models."
zBAxiQi2nPc,49584,52079,You can deploy one windows image to any hardware model
zBAxiQi2nPc,52080,55104,with ease and you can get free licenses worth over $500
zBAxiQi2nPc,55104,57696,at smartdeploy.com/linus.
zBAxiQi2nPc,57696,60279,(upbeat music)
zBAxiQi2nPc,67068,68172,"The first two questions on your mind,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,68172,70500,are probably why we weren't able to get one of these.
zBAxiQi2nPc,70500,72432,and what ultimately changed
zBAxiQi2nPc,72432,75120,that resulted in me holding one in my hands right now.
zBAxiQi2nPc,75120,76128,The answer to the first one
zBAxiQi2nPc,76128,77614,is that Nvidia just plain
zBAxiQi2nPc,77614,79872,doesn't seed these things to reviewers
zBAxiQi2nPc,79872,82455,"and at a cost of about $10,000."
zBAxiQi2nPc,83376,85836,"It's not the sort of thing that I would just,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,85836,87276,"you know, buy."
zBAxiQi2nPc,87276,89082,'Cause I got that swagger.
zBAxiQi2nPc,89082,90762,You know what I'm saying?
zBAxiQi2nPc,90762,92778,"As for how we got one,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,92778,93797,I can't tell you.
zBAxiQi2nPc,93797,94630,"And in fact,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,94630,96270,we even blacked out the serial number
zBAxiQi2nPc,96270,100121,"to prevent the fan who reached out offering to get us one,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,100122,102282,from getting identified.
zBAxiQi2nPc,102282,103818,This individual agreed to let us
zBAxiQi2nPc,103818,105523,do anything we want with it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,105523,106854,"So you can bet your butt,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,106854,108257,we're gonna be taking it apart.
zBAxiQi2nPc,108258,110622,And all we had to offer in return
zBAxiQi2nPc,110622,113310,"was that we would test Ethereum mining on it,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,113310,116095,"send a shroud, that'll allow 'em to actually cool the thing"
zBAxiQi2nPc,116095,118387,and reassemble it before we return it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,118387,122887,"So let's compare it really quickly to the CMP 170 HX,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,122887,125406,which it is the most similar card that we have.
zBAxiQi2nPc,125406,126991,It's the silver metal
zBAxiQi2nPc,126991,129498,and it's not ripped for my pleasure.
zBAxiQi2nPc,129498,131038,Regrettable. - [Jake] Alright.
zBAxiQi2nPc,131039,133482,- And we actually have one other point of comparison.
zBAxiQi2nPc,133482,134950,This isn't a perfect one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,134951,136931,This is an RTX 3090.
zBAxiQi2nPc,136931,139344,And what would've been maybe more apt
zBAxiQi2nPc,139344,142176,is the Quadro or rather they dropped the Quadro banding.
zBAxiQi2nPc,142176,143996,But the A6000.
zBAxiQi2nPc,143996,146592,Unfortunately that's another really expensive card
zBAxiQi2nPc,146592,149086,that I don't have a legitimate reason to buy
zBAxiQi2nPc,149087,150654,and Nvidia wouldn't send one of those
zBAxiQi2nPc,150654,152160,for the comparison either.
zBAxiQi2nPc,152160,154175,So the specs on this are pretty similar.
zBAxiQi2nPc,154175,155403,We're gonna use it as a standin'
zBAxiQi2nPc,155403,156264,since we're not really looking
zBAxiQi2nPc,156264,158724,at any workstation loads anyway.
zBAxiQi2nPc,158724,160068,So the A100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,160068,162318,This is a 40 gigabyte card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,163908,165670,I'm gonna let at that sink in for a second.
zBAxiQi2nPc,165670,167265,"And the craziest part,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,167265,169803,is that 40 gigs is not even enough
zBAxiQi2nPc,169803,171189,for the kinds of workloads
zBAxiQi2nPc,171190,173735,that these cards are used to crunch through.
zBAxiQi2nPc,173735,175453,We're talking enormous data sets
zBAxiQi2nPc,175453,177625,"to the point where this 40 gig model,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,177625,179259,"is actually obsolete now,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,179259,180898,replaced by an 80 gig model.
zBAxiQi2nPc,180898,182986,"And these NV Link bridge,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,182986,184049,"connectors on the top here,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,184050,185724,let's go ahead and pull these off.
zBAxiQi2nPc,185724,187854,"These, there we go,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,187854,190588,are used to link up multiples of these cards
zBAxiQi2nPc,190588,193131,so they can all pull memory
zBAxiQi2nPc,193131,195627,and work on even larger data sets.
zBAxiQi2nPc,195628,197060,"Now the diet, the center of it,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,197060,200101,is a seven nanometer TSMC manufactured GPU
zBAxiQi2nPc,200101,201860,called the GA 100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,201860,202885,We're gonna pop this shroud off.
zBAxiQi2nPc,202885,204068,We're gonna take a look at it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,204068,207543,"It has a base clock of just 765 megahertz,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,207543,210642,but it'll boost up to fourteen ten.
zBAxiQi2nPc,210642,211650,That memory runs
zBAxiQi2nPc,211650,214709,at a whopping one and a half terabytes a second
zBAxiQi2nPc,214710,216793,of bandwidth on a massive
zBAxiQi2nPc,217686,218853,"5,120 bit bus."
zBAxiQi2nPc,220717,222799,"It's got 6,912 CUDA cores"
zBAxiQi2nPc,224214,225892,"and, what is it?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,225892,226974,250 watt TDP.
zBAxiQi2nPc,228891,230140,Woooh.
zBAxiQi2nPc,230140,231436,She's packing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,231436,232444,"- [Jake] Oh, you're just going right for it."
zBAxiQi2nPc,232444,233318,- I'm going right for.
zBAxiQi2nPc,233318,234150,- [Jake] Oh geez.
zBAxiQi2nPc,234151,235618,- This is Linus tech tips.
zBAxiQi2nPc,235618,237304,- [Jake] And basically every part of this
zBAxiQi2nPc,237304,240040,is identical to the CMP card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,240040,241239,- It kinda looks that way.
zBAxiQi2nPc,241240,242679,I mean the color's obviously different.
zBAxiQi2nPc,242679,244457,"- Yeah, but it looks like the clamshell"
zBAxiQi2nPc,244457,246472,is two pieces in the same manner.
zBAxiQi2nPc,246472,248103,There's no display outputs.
zBAxiQi2nPc,248103,249675,The fins look the same.
zBAxiQi2nPc,249675,252916,- Now here's something the CMP card specifically
zBAxiQi2nPc,252916,256178,"didn't even contain the hardware for video in code,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,256178,257012,if I recall correctly.
zBAxiQi2nPc,257012,258183,"- Yeah, this doesn't have anything."
zBAxiQi2nPc,258183,259863,"- Okay, so it's not that it was fused off."
zBAxiQi2nPc,259864,261784,It's just plain not on the chip.
zBAxiQi2nPc,261784,263512,"- Not on GA 100, yeah."
zBAxiQi2nPc,263512,264435,"- Okay but,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,264435,267107,"- GA102, which is like 3090."
zBAxiQi2nPc,267107,267940,- Yes.
zBAxiQi2nPc,267940,268773,- Does have it. - Ooh.
zBAxiQi2nPc,268773,270526,- And A6000.
zBAxiQi2nPc,270526,271359,"- Okay, you ready?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,271359,272192,- Oh God!
zBAxiQi2nPc,274581,275414,So yeah. - Hey.
zBAxiQi2nPc,275414,276814,- It's like exactly the same on the inside.
zBAxiQi2nPc,276814,278626,Same junk power connector.
zBAxiQi2nPc,278626,279459,- Wow.
zBAxiQi2nPc,279459,281027,"That is super junk,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,281027,281998,check this out guys.
zBAxiQi2nPc,281998,285504,"It uses a single eight pin EPS power connector,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,285505,289967,which you might think is a PCIE power connector.
zBAxiQi2nPc,289967,291598,"So here, look, I'll show you guys."
zBAxiQi2nPc,291598,293074,"This is an eight pin,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,293074,294418,"like normal GPU connector,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,294418,296418,"but watch, cannot go in."
zBAxiQi2nPc,297443,298438,But if we take the connector
zBAxiQi2nPc,298438,302382,"out of our CPU socket on the motherboard,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,302382,303215,"There you go although,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,303215,305255,the clips are interfering a little bit.
zBAxiQi2nPc,305256,307325,"I mean, what the heck is going on here,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,307325,308627,ladies and gentlemen?
zBAxiQi2nPc,308627,309805,- You need more power.
zBAxiQi2nPc,309805,310651,- Yeah exactly.
zBAxiQi2nPc,310651,314148,- So you can combine two PCIE connectors into that.
zBAxiQi2nPc,314148,315971,- [Andy] Can't remember how to get it outta here.
zBAxiQi2nPc,315971,317699,I see the fingerprint of the technician
zBAxiQi2nPc,317699,318803,who assembled the card though.
zBAxiQi2nPc,318803,321011,- I think we have to unclip this part first.
zBAxiQi2nPc,321011,322738,"Oh, there's a little screw, right?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,322739,323606,- There's a little screw.
zBAxiQi2nPc,323606,326543,"- Haha, third type of screws."
zBAxiQi2nPc,326543,328091,"- [Andy] Yourself. - Didn't see that one, nerd."
zBAxiQi2nPc,328091,329067,- [Andy] You're a nerd.
zBAxiQi2nPc,329067,330613,- [Jake] Your face is a nerd.
zBAxiQi2nPc,330614,332531,- [Andy] Your but nerd.
zBAxiQi2nPc,333396,334404,- [Jake] Whoa.
zBAxiQi2nPc,334404,336805,"- It's not coming off, Jake."
zBAxiQi2nPc,336805,338529,"- What? You gotta like tilt it out, buddy."
zBAxiQi2nPc,338529,339488,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
zBAxiQi2nPc,339488,340321,Don't pull the cooler off.
zBAxiQi2nPc,340321,341154,- See?
zBAxiQi2nPc,341154,343746,It's like it's caught back here.
zBAxiQi2nPc,343746,344579,- Hey ho.
zBAxiQi2nPc,344579,345412,"Hey, how you doing?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,345412,346245,- Jesus.
zBAxiQi2nPc,348647,349671,- Stressful.
zBAxiQi2nPc,349671,352130,"Look, maybe if we break it,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,352130,353313,you'll actually have to buy one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,353313,354146,- I don't wanna buy one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,354146,355536,That's not the goal. - What?
zBAxiQi2nPc,355536,357182,- I thought you put your hand up for a high five.
zBAxiQi2nPc,357182,359182,"I was like, ""well, what are you talking about?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,359182,360613,"I don't want to buy one."""
zBAxiQi2nPc,360613,361755,- Why not?
zBAxiQi2nPc,361755,362738,"Whoa, what is going on here?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,362738,363571,You see that?
zBAxiQi2nPc,363571,365562,"- It looks like there was a thermal pad there or something,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,365562,367418,"but there isn't, its like greasy."
zBAxiQi2nPc,367418,368809,"- It actually,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,368809,369671,"no, look at it closer."
zBAxiQi2nPc,369671,370504,It's not greasy.
zBAxiQi2nPc,370504,372962,"It's, you see how this is brushed almost."
zBAxiQi2nPc,372962,375639,Or looks somebody sandblasted it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,375639,377223,- That part's not.
zBAxiQi2nPc,377223,378783,I don't remember that on this card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,378783,381039,"- Alright, so the spring loading mechanism"
zBAxiQi2nPc,381040,383620,"is just from the bend of the back plate, that's kinda cool."
zBAxiQi2nPc,383620,386162,- [Jake] So I checked the CMP thing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,386162,387315,Doesn't look like it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,387316,388852,- [Andy] I wonder why they wouldn't have like a map.
zBAxiQi2nPc,388852,391250,- [Jake] This doesn't look brushed at all.
zBAxiQi2nPc,391251,393459,"What did we, last time we twisted?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,393459,394556,"- [Andy] No, I don't think we did."
zBAxiQi2nPc,394556,395648,- Yeah we did.
zBAxiQi2nPc,395648,397876,- [Andy] I'm pretty sure I just rimmed on it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,397876,398709,- [Jake] Oh God! No.
zBAxiQi2nPc,398709,399796,You were against rimming on it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,399796,401332,"And then we were like, just twist a little."
zBAxiQi2nPc,401332,402165,- [Jake] Oh.
zBAxiQi2nPc,402165,403732,God.
zBAxiQi2nPc,403732,404565,Ah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,404565,405988,It has an IHS.
zBAxiQi2nPc,405988,407620,It looks basically the same.
zBAxiQi2nPc,407620,408796,- [Andy] Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,408796,411794,- [Jake] We're gonna have to clean that off and see
zBAxiQi2nPc,411795,413474,there's not much alcohol.
zBAxiQi2nPc,413474,415839,"- [Jake] No, I like to go in dry first."
zBAxiQi2nPc,415839,418839,"So yep, that's the same thing, alright."
zBAxiQi2nPc,418839,420563,"I mean, this isn't the first time Nvidia"
zBAxiQi2nPc,420563,423685,has used the same Silicon in two different products
zBAxiQi2nPc,423685,425895,with two different capabilities.
zBAxiQi2nPc,425895,426728,We see the same thing
zBAxiQi2nPc,426728,429339,with their Quadro lineup versus their GForce lineup
zBAxiQi2nPc,429339,430629,where things will just be disabled
zBAxiQi2nPc,430630,433461,through drivers or fusing off different functional units
zBAxiQi2nPc,433461,434324,on the chip.
zBAxiQi2nPc,434324,435157,What I wanna know then
zBAxiQi2nPc,435157,437818,is besides the lack of NV Link connectors on this one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,437818,439113,"- Well, they are in there."
zBAxiQi2nPc,439113,441177,They're just not accessible and they probably don't work.
zBAxiQi2nPc,441177,442010,- Right.
zBAxiQi2nPc,442010,443672,What is the actual difference
zBAxiQi2nPc,443672,445593,in function between them?
zBAxiQi2nPc,445593,446426,(Jake sighs)
zBAxiQi2nPc,446426,449497,"- Well, this one doesn't have full PCIE 16X,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,449497,452313,- Right? - It does less memory.
zBAxiQi2nPc,452313,453944,"I think it has way less transistors,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,453945,455907,but it is still a GA100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,455907,457965,"- Yeah, so the transistors are there."
zBAxiQi2nPc,457965,460125,"- Yeah, they're probably just not functional."
zBAxiQi2nPc,460125,462006,Let me see what the chip number is on that one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,462006,463288,"- Yeah, 'cause were we not even able"
zBAxiQi2nPc,463288,467128,to find a proper Nvidia.com reference to this one anyway.
zBAxiQi2nPc,467128,469780,So we're just relying on someone else's spec sheet.
zBAxiQi2nPc,469780,471463,So the transistor count could just be wrong.
zBAxiQi2nPc,471463,475425,"- Okay, so this is so the CMP card was a GA."
zBAxiQi2nPc,475425,476526,- Look at this guy?
zBAxiQi2nPc,476527,477360,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,477360,478193,What a weirdo.
zBAxiQi2nPc,478193,479193,GA 100-105F.
zBAxiQi2nPc,480638,482638,And this is a GA100-833.
zBAxiQi2nPc,484358,486134,"- If it's a GA100,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,486134,487862,I guess it could be a different GA100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,487862,488695,I don't know.
zBAxiQi2nPc,488695,489758,"- I mean, it used to be back in the day,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,489758,491822,you would assume that it's just using the same Silicon
zBAxiQi2nPc,491822,494281,as the GForce cards because Nvidia's data center business
zBAxiQi2nPc,494281,495434,"hadn't gotten that big yet,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,495434,497690,"but nowadays, they can totally justify,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,497690,500330,"an individual, like new guide design"
zBAxiQi2nPc,500330,501722,for a particular lineup
zBAxiQi2nPc,501722,502780,of enterprise product.
zBAxiQi2nPc,502781,503846,"- And interestingly enough,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,503846,506294,the SXM version doesn't have an IHS
zBAxiQi2nPc,506294,508142,at least it seems that way.
zBAxiQi2nPc,508142,511750,But the SXM version is also like 400 Watts.
zBAxiQi2nPc,511750,513221,And this is like 250.
zBAxiQi2nPc,513221,514901,"- [Andy] Yeah, totally different classes"
zBAxiQi2nPc,514901,516857,"of capabilities, alright?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,516857,518548,"Let's put it back together then, shall we?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,518549,519701,- I got your new goop. - Goop me.
zBAxiQi2nPc,519701,520661,- I brought two goops.
zBAxiQi2nPc,520661,523661,- We're going for the no look catch.
zBAxiQi2nPc,526425,528175,- Oh yeah baby. - Yes.
zBAxiQi2nPc,529660,532011,"X marks the spot, baby."
zBAxiQi2nPc,532012,533020,My finest work.
zBAxiQi2nPc,533020,534742,- Maybe it'll perform better now.
zBAxiQi2nPc,534742,535660,- [Andy] Probably not.
zBAxiQi2nPc,535660,536748,(Jake laughs)
zBAxiQi2nPc,536749,540347,(Andy truck signals)
zBAxiQi2nPc,540347,541403,We're backing it up.
zBAxiQi2nPc,541403,543343,(Jake chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,543343,544495,"- [Jake] Cool story, bro."
zBAxiQi2nPc,544495,545328,- [Andy] Thanks.
zBAxiQi2nPc,545328,546366,Thanks bro.
zBAxiQi2nPc,546366,548142,- Where's our back plate.
zBAxiQi2nPc,548142,549198,Did you take it?
zBAxiQi2nPc,549198,550698,Oh shoot.
zBAxiQi2nPc,550698,551531,- Yes. - Black.
zBAxiQi2nPc,551531,552427,I thought it was gold.
zBAxiQi2nPc,552427,553433,I was looking for gold.
zBAxiQi2nPc,553433,554391,(Jake laughs)
zBAxiQi2nPc,554392,556229,"- [Jake] Aren't we all. - I don't know about you,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,556229,557551,but I found my gold.
zBAxiQi2nPc,557551,559182,- What's that?
zBAxiQi2nPc,559182,560797,- Yvonne.
zBAxiQi2nPc,560797,562041,- Shut up (chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,562041,562874,- Alright.
zBAxiQi2nPc,562874,563707,Alright.
zBAxiQi2nPc,563707,564540,Let's get going here.
zBAxiQi2nPc,564540,566011,Which one do you wanna put on the bench first?
zBAxiQi2nPc,566012,566845,- What do you mean?
zBAxiQi2nPc,566845,567926,We're not gonna compare to that thing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,567927,570258,It doesn't do anything.
zBAxiQi2nPc,570258,571266,We don't need this thing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,571266,572201,"- But here we go, boys."
zBAxiQi2nPc,572202,573806,- We can't put this in the first lock.
zBAxiQi2nPc,573806,575533,'Cause we don't have a display output.
zBAxiQi2nPc,575533,576637,"- You like the bottom one? - Yeah,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,576637,578385,- You're a bottom?
zBAxiQi2nPc,578385,579218,- Sure.
zBAxiQi2nPc,579218,581120,"- This, okay."
zBAxiQi2nPc,581120,583808,This is how you flex IT style.
zBAxiQi2nPc,583808,584720,Now you might have noticed
zBAxiQi2nPc,584720,586112,at some point that the A100
zBAxiQi2nPc,586112,587732,doesn't have any sort of cooling fan.
zBAxiQi2nPc,587732,590420,"It's just one big fat, long heat sink"
zBAxiQi2nPc,590420,593204,with a giant vapor chamber under it to spread the heat
zBAxiQi2nPc,593204,595173,from that massive GPU.
zBAxiQi2nPc,595173,597573,So Jake actually designed
zBAxiQi2nPc,597573,599252,what we call the shroud donator.
zBAxiQi2nPc,599252,601089,It allows us to take these two screws
zBAxiQi2nPc,601089,602289,that are on the back of the cart
zBAxiQi2nPc,602289,603779,"for securing it in a server chassis,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,603779,605936,because that's how it's designed to be used.
zBAxiQi2nPc,605936,606896,"So it's passive,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,606896,609200,"but there's lots of airflow going through the chassis,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,609200,612117,"and then lets us take those screw holes,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,612117,614456,and mount a fan to the back of the cart.
zBAxiQi2nPc,614456,616539,It's frankly not amazing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,617661,618645,(Jake chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,618645,620325,- What? No.
zBAxiQi2nPc,620325,622871,That is aerodynamics at its peak.
zBAxiQi2nPc,622871,625305,"You should hire me to work on F1 cars, okay?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,625305,626169,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,626169,627002,Not so much.
zBAxiQi2nPc,627002,627835,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,627835,630205,It only blows probably more air out this end
zBAxiQi2nPc,630205,632265,from the back pressure than it does on this end. (laughs)
zBAxiQi2nPc,632265,634382,"But it's enough to cool it, I swear."
zBAxiQi2nPc,634382,635331,- It is. - Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,635331,639206,"- Let's go ahead and turn on the computer, shall we?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,639206,641510,"- Oh yeah, so a couple interesting points here."
zBAxiQi2nPc,641510,643228,It wouldn't boot right off the bat.
zBAxiQi2nPc,643228,645434,You have to enable Above 4G decoding.
zBAxiQi2nPc,645434,647990,And then I also had to go in and I think it's called like
zBAxiQi2nPc,647990,650753,4G MMIO or something like that.
zBAxiQi2nPc,650753,652472,I had to set that to 42.
zBAxiQi2nPc,652473,653841,- Okay.
zBAxiQi2nPc,653841,655377,- The answer to the universe.
zBAxiQi2nPc,655377,656210,- Yes.
zBAxiQi2nPc,656210,657043,Thank you.
zBAxiQi2nPc,657043,657876,And they are both here.
zBAxiQi2nPc,657876,660543,A100 PCIE 40 fricking gigabytes.
zBAxiQi2nPc,662109,665517,"- I installed the like game ready driver for the 3090,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,665517,667499,"and then I installed the data center driver,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,667499,668877,"and I think it overwrote it,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,668877,670269,"but the game ready driver,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,670269,671733,it still showed as like active
zBAxiQi2nPc,671733,674516,and you could do stuff with the A100 and vice versa.
zBAxiQi2nPc,674517,676389,So it's probably fine.
zBAxiQi2nPc,676389,677980,"- Now, interestingly,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,677980,680727,the A100 doesn't show up in task manager at all.
zBAxiQi2nPc,680728,682540,"- [Jake] Did the CMP, I can't,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,682540,683373,"- [Andy] remember. - No, no."
zBAxiQi2nPc,683373,684891,"I don't think it did actually, anyways."
zBAxiQi2nPc,684891,686104,"- What do you wanna do in Blender,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,686104,686937,classroom?
zBAxiQi2nPc,686937,687770,BMW?
zBAxiQi2nPc,687770,688957,BMW's probably too short.
zBAxiQi2nPc,688957,689790,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,689790,690623,Let's do classroom.
zBAxiQi2nPc,690623,692987,I think BMW on a 3090 is like 15 seconds
zBAxiQi2nPc,692987,695046,or something like that anyway so.
zBAxiQi2nPc,695046,697878,- That's also like the spiciest 3090.
zBAxiQi2nPc,697878,699786,"- [Jake] That you can get. Yeah, pretty much."
zBAxiQi2nPc,699786,700986,It's just so thick.
zBAxiQi2nPc,700986,703057,Why would you ever use it?
zBAxiQi2nPc,703057,703890,"- Because you wanted,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,703890,705926,- Is it even doing anything like (chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,705926,706933,"- Here's one reason,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,706933,708154,'cause you can do classroom renders
zBAxiQi2nPc,708154,711292,"in a minute and 18 seconds, that's why?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,711292,712125,- Okay.
zBAxiQi2nPc,712125,712958,"Well, what about the A100?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,712958,714701,"You didn't plug the fan in, hey."
zBAxiQi2nPc,714701,715758,- Oh whoops.
zBAxiQi2nPc,715758,716717,How hot is this?
zBAxiQi2nPc,716717,717626,- Probably warm.
zBAxiQi2nPc,717627,719898,- Fortunately it hasn't been doing anything.
zBAxiQi2nPc,719898,722736,Time to beat is a minute and 18 seconds.
zBAxiQi2nPc,722736,725724,So let's go ahead and see how it does.
zBAxiQi2nPc,725724,728628,- It feels like this is the intake.
zBAxiQi2nPc,728628,729461,I mean it's hot.
zBAxiQi2nPc,729461,730294,"So like, - Oh yeah."
zBAxiQi2nPc,730294,731269,But it's going.
zBAxiQi2nPc,731269,732432,It's going Jake.
zBAxiQi2nPc,732432,733265,It's going.
zBAxiQi2nPc,733265,734098,You did good.
zBAxiQi2nPc,734098,735476,- It works enough.
zBAxiQi2nPc,735476,736680,"This should be like, this is all."
zBAxiQi2nPc,736680,739272,"- This should be way faster. - Way huge GPU, right?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,739272,740909,- [Andy] It's actually slower.
zBAxiQi2nPc,740909,741742,- [Jake] How much?
zBAxiQi2nPc,741742,742575,Not by much.
zBAxiQi2nPc,742575,745083,"- It's like a few seconds, but it's slower."
zBAxiQi2nPc,745083,746835,- So it's worse in CUDA.
zBAxiQi2nPc,746835,748676,What about Optixs?
zBAxiQi2nPc,748676,750402,So the interesting thing
zBAxiQi2nPc,750402,753756,is this card doesn't have Ray Tracing cores.
zBAxiQi2nPc,753756,755287,"The 3090 does,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,755288,757016,see you'd think that Optixs
zBAxiQi2nPc,757016,758984,"would only work on the 3090, right?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,758984,760712,- Do you want me to just try the A100?
zBAxiQi2nPc,760712,761545,"- Yeah, sure."
zBAxiQi2nPc,761545,763700,It's still GPU compute.
zBAxiQi2nPc,763700,767420,- I mean you gotta give it to it in terms of efficiency.
zBAxiQi2nPc,767420,771260,"For real though, even running two renders to the 3090's one,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,771260,774476,the average power consumption here is still lower.
zBAxiQi2nPc,774476,776564,"- [Jake] Yeah well, and looking at while it's running,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,776564,778343,it's like 150 Watts.
zBAxiQi2nPc,778343,779176,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,779176,782302,- [Jake] Versus 350 or whatever it was on the 1390.
zBAxiQi2nPc,782302,784589,"- Yeah, ready to go again?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,784589,785929,- [Jake] Yep.
zBAxiQi2nPc,785929,787549,- Okay. - [Jake] Oh my God.
zBAxiQi2nPc,787549,788848,"- Man, this thing is fast."
zBAxiQi2nPc,788848,790005,- What's the power consumption?
zBAxiQi2nPc,790005,790838,- [Andy] Holy bananas.
zBAxiQi2nPc,790838,791921,- [Jake] 353.
zBAxiQi2nPc,793418,795472,"Still like just,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,795472,797396,I want one of these.
zBAxiQi2nPc,797396,798229,This thing is sick.
zBAxiQi2nPc,798229,799062,(Jake laughs)
zBAxiQi2nPc,799062,799895,It's way faster.
zBAxiQi2nPc,799895,800728,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,800728,801561,There's no question.
zBAxiQi2nPc,801561,802394,We don't even need to.
zBAxiQi2nPc,802394,803480,- It's gonna be like thirty seconds.
zBAxiQi2nPc,803481,804314,- Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,804314,805353,Not even close.
zBAxiQi2nPc,805353,807095,- So do you wanna know why?
zBAxiQi2nPc,807095,808290,- I would love to know why.
zBAxiQi2nPc,808291,809565,- You said it earlier.
zBAxiQi2nPc,809565,811567,You just weren't really thinking about it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,811567,814167,"This has half the CUDA course of a 3090,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,814167,816351,it's likes seven thousandish I think.
zBAxiQi2nPc,816351,818886,"- Right, so it's just full of like machine learning stuff."
zBAxiQi2nPc,818886,822500,"- Yeah, so it has basically half the CUDA cores."
zBAxiQi2nPc,822500,824060,So the fact that it is even close
zBAxiQi2nPc,824060,825881,is kind of crazy in CUDA mode.
zBAxiQi2nPc,825881,827622,"But in Optix, what I found out"
zBAxiQi2nPc,827622,830222,is Optixs will use the Tensor cores
zBAxiQi2nPc,830222,832198,"for like AI Denoising,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,832198,833031,- [Andy] But nothing else.
zBAxiQi2nPc,833031,834045,- Which you'll see in there.
zBAxiQi2nPc,834045,837581,So I think it's falling back to CUDA for the other stuff.
zBAxiQi2nPc,837581,838414,- [Andy] Got it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,838414,842069,- But the 3090 has Ray Tracing and Tensor cores so.
zBAxiQi2nPc,842069,842902,- Right.
zBAxiQi2nPc,842902,845785,- It just demolishes (chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,845786,848568,- Where's the thing where you can select apps
zBAxiQi2nPc,848568,850882,and then tell it which GPU to use.
zBAxiQi2nPc,850882,852026,"Yeah, here we go."
zBAxiQi2nPc,852026,855796,"No, so it'll not allow you to select the A100 to run games,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,855796,858799,"even if we could pipe it through our onboard,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,858799,861191,or through a different graphics card like we did with that.
zBAxiQi2nPc,861191,862048,- [Jake] It doesn't have DirectX Ray
zBAxiQi2nPc,862049,862882,- Mining card ages ago.
zBAxiQi2nPc,862882,865134,No DirectX support whatsoever.
zBAxiQi2nPc,865134,866485,- [Jake] Let's check it in GPU-Z.
zBAxiQi2nPc,866485,868826,- So way fewer CUDA cores.
zBAxiQi2nPc,868826,869659,You can see that
zBAxiQi2nPc,869659,871663,"we go from over 10,000,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,871663,873830,"to a lot less than 10,000."
zBAxiQi2nPc,875030,876954,Pixel fillrates are actually higher.
zBAxiQi2nPc,876954,880389,I guess that's your HBM2 memory talking.
zBAxiQi2nPc,880389,883040,- [Jake] One point five Gigabytes per second.
zBAxiQi2nPc,883041,883925,"- What's a 39,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,883925,885802,One point five terabytes per second.
zBAxiQi2nPc,885802,887254,It's like
zBAxiQi2nPc,887254,888087,- [Jake] 50% or more
zBAxiQi2nPc,888087,890404,- 60% almost.
zBAxiQi2nPc,890405,891550,- Holy banana.
zBAxiQi2nPc,891550,894659,- But what about the supported tech?
zBAxiQi2nPc,894659,897496,"Yeah, so we can do CUDA, OpenCL,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,897496,899144,- [Jake] PhysX (laughing)
zBAxiQi2nPc,899145,899978,- Sure.
zBAxiQi2nPc,899978,901495,- [Jake] We should set it as the PhysX card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,901495,903835,- Dedicated PhysX card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,903835,906073,All the rag dolls everywhere.
zBAxiQi2nPc,906073,909766,- [Jake] And OpenGL but not Direct anything or Vulkan even.
zBAxiQi2nPc,909767,910600,- OpenGL.
zBAxiQi2nPc,911521,913003,Now that's interesting.
zBAxiQi2nPc,913003,914709,- [Jake] Go to the advanced tab.
zBAxiQi2nPc,914710,915594,'Cause you can select
zBAxiQi2nPc,915594,917141,like a specific DirectX version
zBAxiQi2nPc,917141,919273,at the top under General.
zBAxiQi2nPc,919273,921210,"Like well, the DX 12."
zBAxiQi2nPc,921210,922098,What does it say?
zBAxiQi2nPc,922098,922931,Device not found.
zBAxiQi2nPc,922931,925370,It's the same as the mining card.
zBAxiQi2nPc,925370,926703,It'll do OpenCL.
zBAxiQi2nPc,927632,930636,So we can't mine on it (chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,930636,932302,"- Alright. I mean, should we try that?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,932302,934435,"- [Jake] Yeah, we could do mining or folding or."
zBAxiQi2nPc,934435,936722,"- Sure, I have a feeling that's gonna kind of suck"
zBAxiQi2nPc,936722,937706,for that too.
zBAxiQi2nPc,937706,939881,- There's not. - Like AI in mining.
zBAxiQi2nPc,939881,940870,- I don't think so.
zBAxiQi2nPc,940870,942495,It's still a big GPU dude.
zBAxiQi2nPc,942495,944029,- So you can't.
zBAxiQi2nPc,944030,945152,"- Well suck is relative, right?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,945152,946839,Like for the price you'd never buy.
zBAxiQi2nPc,946839,949308,- I think it might be better than the CMP card though.
zBAxiQi2nPc,949309,951363,Just a little bit. - Shut up.
zBAxiQi2nPc,951363,952246,- I think so.
zBAxiQi2nPc,952246,954118,"So the only thing you can adjust,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,954118,956250,I think this is the same with the CMP card
zBAxiQi2nPc,956250,958305,is the core clock and the power limit.
zBAxiQi2nPc,958305,959865,You can't mess with the memory speed.
zBAxiQi2nPc,959865,961450,- [Andy] And you can move the power limit only down
zBAxiQi2nPc,961450,962283,it looks like.
zBAxiQi2nPc,962283,963116,- [Jake] Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,963116,963949,"Top is the 3090,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,963949,964782,bottom is the A100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,964782,965615,- [Andy] Wow.
zBAxiQi2nPc,965615,968623,That is a crap tone faster than a 3090.
zBAxiQi2nPc,968623,970339,"- [Jake] It's pretty much the same as the CMP,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,970339,971795,but look at the efficiency.
zBAxiQi2nPc,971795,973878,- 714 kilo hash per watt.
zBAxiQi2nPc,975412,977466,- [Jake] And I bet you if we lower the power limit
zBAxiQi2nPc,977466,978383,"to like 80,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,979224,980733,it's a little bit lower speed.
zBAxiQi2nPc,980733,982657,"Maybe we can go, I don't know."
zBAxiQi2nPc,982657,985665,We probably don't have to tinker with this too much.
zBAxiQi2nPc,985665,987480,"I mean, it doesn't draw that much power to begin with,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,987480,988714,I guess. - Yeah.
zBAxiQi2nPc,988715,990457,I think it's pretty fricking efficient
zBAxiQi2nPc,990457,991548,right outta the box.
zBAxiQi2nPc,991549,993167,- I mean the efficiency is better.
zBAxiQi2nPc,993167,994149,"It's a little bit better,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,994149,996726,but before it was doing 175 mega hash
zBAxiQi2nPc,996726,998363,"roughly at 250 Watts,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,998363,1001016,so it's pretty pretty good.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1001016,1004565,"3090, you can probably do like 300 Watts"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1004565,1005764,with 120 mega hash.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1005764,1008207,We're running the folding client now.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1008208,1009946,"I've had it running for a few minutes,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1009946,1012472,and it's kind of hard to say.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1012472,1013485,"The thing with folding is,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1013486,1015363,"based on whatever project you're running,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1015363,1019154,"which is whatever job the server has sent you to process,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1019155,1021468,your points per day will be higher or lower.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1021468,1023861,So it's possible that the A100 got a job
zBAxiQi2nPc,1023861,1027156,that rewards less points than the 3090 did.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1027156,1028819,"It does look like it's a bit higher,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1028819,1030691,but you can see our 39.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1030692,1031641,"This is like a little,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1031641,1033317,like comparison app thing
zBAxiQi2nPc,1033317,1036298,is 31% lower than the average.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1036298,1037546,So it's probably just that this job
zBAxiQi2nPc,1037546,1039157,doesn't give you that many points.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1039157,1040146,- Got it.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1040146,1041965,- The interesting part is
zBAxiQi2nPc,1041965,1043548,the 3090's drawing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1044605,1045438,400 watt.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1045438,1046496,- [Both] 400.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1046496,1047329,- Holy shnikes.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1047329,1048313,- [Jake] A100 is drawing.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1048313,1049516,- 240.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1049516,1050842,(Jake laughing)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1050842,1052298,"Man, that's efficient"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1052298,1053702,and performance per what?
zBAxiQi2nPc,1053702,1055353,Maybe gamers don't care that much.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1055353,1056550,"Actually we know for a fact,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1056550,1057901,gamers don't care that much.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1057901,1060571,"In the data center, that's everything,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1060571,1062234,"because the cost of the card,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1062234,1065511,"is trivial compared to the cost of power delivery,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1065511,1068046,and cooling on a data center scale.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1068046,1069722,- Especially when you have eight of these
zBAxiQi2nPc,1069722,1071334,"with a 400 watt power budget,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1071334,1074500,"like you would get on the SXM cards in a single chassis,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1074500,1075917,"times 50 chassis,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1076751,1080204,like that's a lot of power (chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1080204,1083031,"- Let's try something, machine learning."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1083031,1085365,"- Unfortunately for obvious reasons,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1085365,1087757,"most machine learning or deep learning,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1087757,1089601,"whatever you want to call it, benchmarks,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1089601,1090630,don't run on windows.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1090630,1092632,So instead I've switched over to Ubuntu
zBAxiQi2nPc,1092632,1094450,"and we've set up the CUDA Toolkit,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1094451,1095908,which is gonna include our GPU drivers
zBAxiQi2nPc,1095908,1097429,that we need to even run the thing
zBAxiQi2nPc,1097429,1100263,"as well as Docker and the Nvidia Docker Container,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1100263,1101743,which will allow us to run the benchmark.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1101744,1104501,"We're gonna be running the ResNet-50 benchmark,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1104501,1106242,which runs within TensorFlow two.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1106243,1108313,"This is a really, really common benchmark"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1108313,1110562,"for big data, clusters and stuff."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1110562,1113562,"Except our cluster, is just one GPU."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1114410,1116763,"In a separate window, I've got Nvidia SMI running."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1116763,1119845,"It's kind of like the Linux version of MSI Afterburner,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1119845,1122392,"but it's made by Nvidia, so not quite,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1122392,1123763,"but what it's good for,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1123764,1126150,"is at least telling us our power and the memory usage,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1126150,1127982,which we should see spike a lot
zBAxiQi2nPc,1127982,1129074,"when we run this benchmark,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1129074,1131336,I took the liberty of pre-creating a command
zBAxiQi2nPc,1131337,1132325,to run the benchmark.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1132325,1133937,So we're gonna be running with XLA on
zBAxiQi2nPc,1133937,1135549,to hopefully bump the numbers a bit.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1135549,1137471,We will do that for the A100 as well.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1137472,1138565,So no worries there.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1138565,1139448,It should be the same
zBAxiQi2nPc,1139448,1141502,"as well as using, what do you want?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1141502,1143882,"Look, he left cause he didn't have time for this."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1143882,1144920,And now he's back.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1144921,1146794,This is the world's most expensive lint roller.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1146794,1147976,(Andy chuckles)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1147976,1150372,"I even don't remember what I was saying, damn it."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1150372,1153453,"Distractions aside, we're gonna be running with XLA on."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1153453,1155274,That'll probably give us a bit higher number
zBAxiQi2nPc,1155274,1156470,"than you would normally,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1156470,1158328,but it is still accurate
zBAxiQi2nPc,1158328,1159785,and we're gonna be running the same settings
zBAxiQi2nPc,1159785,1160876,on the A100 as well.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1160876,1161943,So no concerns there.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1161943,1164828,We'll also be using a batch size of 512
zBAxiQi2nPc,1164828,1167936,as well as fp16 rather than fp32.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1167936,1169599,"So if you wanna re-create these tests yourself,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1169599,1170613,you totally can.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1170613,1173383,Let's see what our 3090 can do.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1173383,1177133,Look at that 24 gigs of VRAM completely used.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1179275,1181459,"God, I don't know if there's any application"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1181459,1184734,aside from like Premier that will use all that VRAM.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1184734,1187595,I'm sure Andy can attest to that (strained laugh)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1187595,1189834,"Okay, 1,400 images a second."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1189834,1191380,That's pretty respectable.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1191380,1193148,"I think like a V100,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1193148,1195643,which is the predecessor to the A100
zBAxiQi2nPc,1195644,1198291,does like less than 1000.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1198291,1199672,"So the fact that a 3090,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1199672,1201856,which is a consumer gaming card
zBAxiQi2nPc,1201856,1204966,can pull off those kind of numbers is huge.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1204966,1207716,"Mind you, the wattage, 412 Watts."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1208974,1210807,That's a lot of power.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1211899,1213627,It'll be interesting to see how much more efficient
zBAxiQi2nPc,1213627,1215940,the A100 is when we try that after.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1215940,1216827,"The test is done now,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1216828,1218854,and the average total images per second
zBAxiQi2nPc,1218854,1220187,"is 1,400 and 35."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1221302,1222237,It's pretty good.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1222237,1224098,I've gone ahead and added our A100
zBAxiQi2nPc,1224098,1225994,so we can run the benchmarks on that instead.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1225994,1227269,"And I'm expecting,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1227269,1230180,this is gonna be substantially more performant.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1230180,1231116,So it's the same test.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1231116,1233846,I'm just gonna run the command here.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1233847,1235771,Gonna wait a few seconds.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1235771,1237421,We got Nvidia SMI up again.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1237421,1240828,You can see that it's just running on the A100.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1240828,1242608,The RAM on the 3090 is not getting filled.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1242608,1244740,We're just using that as a display output.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1244740,1246873,"See, all 40 gigabytes used."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1246873,1248693,That's crazy.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1248693,1250721,(Jack laughing)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1250721,1253164,If we thought the 3090 was fast.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1253165,1254204,Look at that Andy.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1254204,1256898,"That's like a full 1000 images more,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1256899,1258822,we're getting like 2400
zBAxiQi2nPc,1258822,1259995,instead of 1400
zBAxiQi2nPc,1259995,1261542,and the icing on the cake.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1261542,1263479,"If you look at Nvidia SMI,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1263479,1266160,we're using like 250 Watts
zBAxiQi2nPc,1266160,1267980,"instead 400,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1267980,1270635,while getting like almost double the performance.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1270635,1271718,That is nuts.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1272767,1273937,- Probably the coolest thing
zBAxiQi2nPc,1273937,1275181,"about this whole experience though,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1275181,1277307,is seeing the Ampere architecture
zBAxiQi2nPc,1277307,1279611,on a seven nanometer manufacturing process.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1279611,1280458,'cause you gotta remember
zBAxiQi2nPc,1280458,1282603,while none of this is applicable to our daily business.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1282603,1284241,"What this card does do,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1284241,1287569,is excite me for the next generation of Nvidia GPUs.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1287569,1289752,Because even though the word on the street
zBAxiQi2nPc,1289753,1292405,"is that the upcoming Ada Lovelace architecture,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1292405,1295928,is not going to be that different from Ampere.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1295928,1298164,"Consider this, Nvidia's gaming lineup"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1298164,1300659,"is built on Samsung's eight nanometer node,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1300660,1304378,while the A100 is built on TSMC's seven nanometer node.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1304378,1307459,"Now we've talked a fair bit about how nanometers,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1307459,1309266,"from one fab to another,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1309266,1312100,can't really be directly compared in that way.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1312100,1315169,"But what we can do, is say that it is rumored,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1315169,1316389,that Nvidia will be building
zBAxiQi2nPc,1316390,1319445,the newer ADA Lovelace gaming GPUs
zBAxiQi2nPc,1319445,1322149,"on TSMC's five nanometer node,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1322150,1324265,which should perform even better
zBAxiQi2nPc,1324265,1325907,than their seven nanometer node.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1325907,1327492,And if the efficiency of improvements
zBAxiQi2nPc,1327492,1329429,"are anything like what we're seeing here,"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1329429,1330937,we are expecting those cards
zBAxiQi2nPc,1330937,1333862,to be absolute freaking monsters.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1333862,1335862,So good luck buying one.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1336852,1337866,(Jake laughing)
zBAxiQi2nPc,1337866,1339685,"Hey, at least you can buy one of these."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1339686,1342171,"We've got new pillows, that's right."
zBAxiQi2nPc,1342171,1344353,"This is the, what are we calling it?"
zBAxiQi2nPc,1344353,1345186,- [Jake] Couch ripper.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1345186,1346784,- The couch ripper the couch rip.
zBAxiQi2nPc,1346784,1348189,It's an AMD themed version
