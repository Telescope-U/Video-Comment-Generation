P9dxlUD1Fx8,0,3179,let's learn how to draw so today I'm
P9dxlUD1Fx8,3179,4859,going to be teaching you how to draw an
P9dxlUD1Fx8,4859,7200,easy tree trunk start off by filling
P9dxlUD1Fx8,7200,9360,your entire page in with brown now
P9dxlUD1Fx8,9360,12120,select the color black and some sort of
P9dxlUD1Fx8,12120,14759,texturized brush now just start creating
P9dxlUD1Fx8,14759,17220,some random lines on your page make sure
P9dxlUD1Fx8,17220,20100,the lines vary in width and now just
P9dxlUD1Fx8,20100,22560,create some lines that come off a line
P9dxlUD1Fx8,22560,24900,and then connect back to itself kind of
P9dxlUD1Fx8,24900,26760,like a loop and just keep doing this
P9dxlUD1Fx8,26760,29099,until the lines cover most of the page
P9dxlUD1Fx8,29099,32340,then go in and duplicate your layer the
P9dxlUD1Fx8,32340,34500,left the bottom layer and apply a little
P9dxlUD1Fx8,34500,37500,bit of a blur filter and then select the
P9dxlUD1Fx8,37500,39719,top layer and change the blending mode
P9dxlUD1Fx8,39719,42840,to Overlay now create one final layer
P9dxlUD1Fx8,42840,45420,and select a bit of a lighter brown and
P9dxlUD1Fx8,45420,47219,just color in in between the lines
P9dxlUD1Fx8,47219,49500,you've already made set the blending
P9dxlUD1Fx8,49500,51780,mode to lighter color then I just added
P9dxlUD1Fx8,51780,54300,some shading and Moss and now you can
P9dxlUD1Fx8,54300,56399,just take this layer and apply it to
P9dxlUD1Fx8,56399,58199,your tree trunk and this is what it
P9dxlUD1Fx8,58199,58670,looks like
