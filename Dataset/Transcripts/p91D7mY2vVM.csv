p91D7mY2vVM,2480,6160,"When a lion is born, it's not a lion when a lion is born, it's a cub.  "
p91D7mY2vVM,6160,8000,Do you know what makes it look the way it looks?  
p91D7mY2vVM,8560,11760,How does a lion look like that but a giraffe don't look like that?  
p91D7mY2vVM,12336,15760,He's chasing the food. So it is the process of hunting  
p91D7mY2vVM,15760,18240,it's not the actual meat that makes him look like that.  
p91D7mY2vVM,18880,22160,It is the actual hunt. It's the actual chasing.  
p91D7mY2vVM,22160,24640,So whether he catches it or not every time  
p91D7mY2vVM,24640,27759,he goes on a hunt he's developing.  
p91D7mY2vVM,27760,30640,Some of y'all so caught up on the game  that you don't get it.  
p91D7mY2vVM,30640,32880,It is in practicing it is in lifting weights  
p91D7mY2vVM,32880,34880,it is in resting it is in eating right  
p91D7mY2vVM,34880,37600,it is in making good decisions that you look a certain way.  
p91D7mY2vVM,37600,40079,It is how you practice it is what you do that  
p91D7mY2vVM,40080,43040,makes you look like you look. It is the process of the grind  
p91D7mY2vVM,43040,46000,that shapes you and forms you it's not the game.  
p91D7mY2vVM,46000,49840,And that's why most of y'all get beat in the game or make mistakes in the game  
p91D7mY2vVM,49840,53440,because you think grinding is what happens when the sun comes out.  
p91D7mY2vVM,53440,55920,You think grinding is what  happens when the lights come on.  
p91D7mY2vVM,55920,58480,You think grinding is what happens when people get in the stage.  
p91D7mY2vVM,58480,61120,That's not grind. The real grind is in the dark  
p91D7mY2vVM,61120,64960,when nobody sees you when nobody knows what you're doing  
p91D7mY2vVM,64960,68960,when you're studying without coach when you're putting in those extra reps  
p91D7mY2vVM,68960,71520,when you're watching those videos and you're getting inspired  
p91D7mY2vVM,71520,75280,when you change your music. It's the process that makes you sweet.  
p91D7mY2vVM,76240,79040,You know how you get mentally tough? It's a lifestyle.  
p91D7mY2vVM,79040,81600,Instead of hitting that f*cking snooze button in the f*cking morning  
p91D7mY2vVM,81600,83920,and not making your bed and not cleaning your house  
p91D7mY2vVM,83920,85920,you don't hit the snooze button. You get up.  
p91D7mY2vVM,85920,87759,You don't want to go run? You go run.  
p91D7mY2vVM,87760,89360,You don't want to go swim? You go swim.  
p91D7mY2vVM,89360,91040,You don't want to make your bed? You make your bed.  
p91D7mY2vVM,91040,92880,You don't want to clean your house? You clean your house.  
p91D7mY2vVM,92880,94640,You don't want to study? You f*cking study.  
p91D7mY2vVM,94640,97680,That's how you start to callous your mind it's gonna suck.  
p91D7mY2vVM,97680,100640,Do something that sucks every single day of your life.  
p91D7mY2vVM,100640,102960,That's how you grow. Embrace the suck.  
p91D7mY2vVM,104320,107840,"No one's gonna f*cking come to help me. It's f*cking me against me, period.  "
p91D7mY2vVM,107840,110560,The water is too cold the suns too hot  
p91D7mY2vVM,110560,113119,I'm getting up too early why am I doing this to myself?  
p91D7mY2vVM,113120,115520,That's what the normal mind says.  
p91D7mY2vVM,115520,118880,I had to start training my mind to think about how the f*ck  
p91D7mY2vVM,118880,122079,can I get through this? Not giving myself a way out.  
p91D7mY2vVM,122080,126080,Creating a wall around all the f*cking ways out in my mind.  
p91D7mY2vVM,126080,128720,So my mind knew this motherf*cker  
p91D7mY2vVM,128720,131680,is not gonna give himself away out of here.  
p91D7mY2vVM,131680,134400,My new norm is you get up every f*cking morning at 4 o'clock  
p91D7mY2vVM,134400,136720,and you suffer. That became my new f*cking life.  
p91D7mY2vVM,136720,138880,"Most people want to get out of it. I said, nah motherf*cker  "
p91D7mY2vVM,138880,140880,this is your new life. This is who you are.  
p91D7mY2vVM,140880,143040,Your new norm is you wake up and you suffer.  
p91D7mY2vVM,143040,145680,And I started realizing if that's my mentality  
p91D7mY2vVM,145680,148560,this sh*t ain't hard anymore. You must re-train your mind  
p91D7mY2vVM,148560,150720,to think differently in hell.  
p91D7mY2vVM,150720,152480,When something sucks good.  
p91D7mY2vVM,152480,155280,It's gonna make me tougher and it's gonna make us  
p91D7mY2vVM,155280,156720,stronger. So bring it.  
p91D7mY2vVM,156720,160080,And that's when your mind changes. That's when your focus changes.  
p91D7mY2vVM,160080,162960,Your dedication changes. Use this time  
p91D7mY2vVM,162960,165600,to gain strength. Gain focus.  
p91D7mY2vVM,165600,167760,Come out a savage. You gotta start thinking  
p91D7mY2vVM,167760,170799,I'm the grittiest motherf*cker in the world. You don't need sh*t.  
p91D7mY2vVM,170800,174880,You need the ability to f*cking grind your ass into a fine f*cking powder.  
p91D7mY2vVM,174880,178720,Greatness is not something that you meet once. It's something that you meet  
p91D7mY2vVM,178720,181840,thousands of f*cking times in your life and you don't reach it  
p91D7mY2vVM,181840,183920,if you're not constantly in constant  
p91D7mY2vVM,183920,186240,f*cking pursuit of greatness.  
p91D7mY2vVM,186240,188800,Kobe Bryant doesn't f*cking sit there and talk about  
p91D7mY2vVM,188800,192560,how many MVPs he's won or how many championships he's won.  
p91D7mY2vVM,192560,195360,"No, the motherf*cker's up  at 3 o'clock in the morning  "
p91D7mY2vVM,195360,197360,practicing every day.  
p91D7mY2vVM,197360,200720,Why do you think he's so great? He's not great because he's great  
p91D7mY2vVM,200720,202800,he's great because he puts  the f*cking working in   
p91D7mY2vVM,202800,205200,on a daily basis and he wins  
p91D7mY2vVM,205200,207040,every f*cking day.  
p91D7mY2vVM,207040,208319,This is the time to work.  
p91D7mY2vVM,208320,211840,You better take the short time you have and be the best that you can be.  
p91D7mY2vVM,211840,225840,'Cause they pay you different  when you're the best.
