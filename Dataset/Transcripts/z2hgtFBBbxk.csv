z2hgtFBBbxk,25600,30160,"By the mid-17th century, the age of  flamboyant Baroque was in full swing.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,30720,33520,It was an art movement that came from conflict.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,34080,40400,"Europe had experienced the reformation and counter  reformation, the wars of religion and inquisitions.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,41120,47440,"The art being produced in Catholic countries had  become a powerful tool of propaganda, characterized  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,47440,53519,"by a heightened sense of drama, movement and  theatricality that had never been seen before.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,56480,62079,But in the Netherlands a new wave of realism  was sweeping across the country - Johannes Vermeer  
z2hgtFBBbxk,62080,67920,"was producing simple domestic interiors of  middle-class life. His paintings were quiet,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,67920,74240,private and unassuming. Secular works that  contain stories of real human relationships.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,74240,80399,"Vermeer's art would be totally forgotten about,  right up until the mid-19th century - the age  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,80400,86240,of the camera. His incredible mastery of  hyper-realism would lead some people to  
z2hgtFBBbxk,86240,92880,question the authenticity of Vermeer. To question  whether he used mechanical means to achieve such  
z2hgtFBBbxk,92880,99840,"perfect illusions. For some people, as we shall  see, Johannes Vermeer is considered a ""cheat""."
z2hgtFBBbxk,119360,126240,"In 1556 the Habsburgs took over the low countries  what today is the Netherlands, Belgium and  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,126240,132480,"Luxembourg, and ruled it as a Spanish province. It  was a clash of two dramatically different cultures:  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,133280,136959,"the northern territories were  Protestant, the southern Catholic.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,136960,144240,"""The 80 years war"", ended in independence for the  north in 1648, while the Southern Netherlands  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,144240,149760,remained Catholic and a part of Spain. In the  north the strict protestant sect of Calvinism  
z2hgtFBBbxk,149760,155760,"became the nation's official religion. Religious  imagery was banned, and an emphasis was placed  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,155760,161920,on simplicity in both worship and decorative  style. The sharp break with the old monarchist  
z2hgtFBBbxk,161920,169840,"and Catholic cultural traditions, would mean that  Dutch art had to reinvent itself almost entirely."
z2hgtFBBbxk,172080,178000,"We know Vermeer was born in delft in 1632,  then next to nothing is known about him  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,178000,185600,until he marries Catherina Bolnes in 1653. She was  Catholic and Vermeer almost certainly converted to  
z2hgtFBBbxk,185600,192080,"Catholicism secretly before they married - probably  at the insistence of his wealthy mother-in-law,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,192080,197520,"who at first opposed the marriage. Although  Catholic mass was banned, freedom of religion  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,197520,203760,"in the Dutch republic was official, and converting  to Catholicism didn't bring Vermeer any personal  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,203760,209760,or professional disadvantages. The couple moved  in with Catherina's mother and Vermeer spent the  
z2hgtFBBbxk,209760,215760,"rest of his life in the same town, the same house,  slowly producing paintings in the same room, on  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,215760,222000,"the second floor, at a rate of two or three a year.  It is thought Vermeer produced 60 or so paintings  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,222000,228400,of which only 36 survive today. Vermeer  and Catherina had 15 children of which  
z2hgtFBBbxk,228400,234799,"11 survived. We know at least five other adults  lived in the same house,   as well as Vermeer's own  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,234800,241360,"11 children! And yet he never shows us any  suggestion of family, or the chaos that  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,241360,246480,naturally comes with a household that big.  It is safe to say that the peace and quiet  
z2hgtFBBbxk,246480,253840,"Vermeer depicts in his paintings, was not what he  experienced in real life - maybe that is the point?"
z2hgtFBBbxk,256959,262880,"""Genre paintings"" were scenes of everyday life,  ordinary people engaged in common activities  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,262880,270667,"that both reflected and helped define ideals about  the family, love, morals, courtship, and duty.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,270997,277360,"In the 17th century, the Dutch republic dominated global  trade, and was the wealthiest country in the world.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,277360,282639,"But the dutch Calvinists were a frugal and  austere group, naturally inhibited and embarrassed  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,282640,290080,"by wealth. Smaller, quiet, secular paintings became  hugely popular, and no longer the preserve of the  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,290080,296479,"church or aristocracy or even the very wealthy.  Paintings could be found in shops, taverns and  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,296480,303760,"houses. It was a boom time for artists. Along  with paintings, maps started to appear in homes,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,303760,310320,appealing to the Dutch desire for order. Cityscapes  were an emblem of self-determination and a sense  
z2hgtFBBbxk,310320,317200,"of pride in the young Dutch republic. While Dutch  Calvinists denounced devotional artwork in churches,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,317200,322320,they explicitly encouraged devotees to turn  their attention to the visible world around them.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,323680,328160,"One of the most successful subcategories  of genre painting was the ""kitchen scene"".  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,328720,333680,"The Dutch saw hard work as spiritual,  and household economy as a holy virtue,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,333680,339440,"moderation in all things. There were so many  Dutch artists producing genre paintings, but  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,339440,344720,"if we look at these two paintings on the same  theme, we see there were none quite like Vermeer,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,345840,352639,"whose quiet settings, serene lighting, cropping,  and ambiguousness made his scenes more universal"
z2hgtFBBbxk,352640,358160,"than most genre paintings. Artists borrowed themes  and compositions from each other readily, there  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,358160,365840,"was no shame in ""copying"". Once a theme took off in  sales, artists would produce their own variations."
z2hgtFBBbxk,367280,374320,"Vermeer's paintings are all small but ""The milkmaid""  is very small. It is oil on canvas. According to  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,374320,380880,"conservators, it took two months to paint. The first  thing to note is that she is not a milkmaid but a  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,380880,387120,"domestic kitchen maid. She is a young woman  of a strong build, wearing a crisp linen cap,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,387120,393440,a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from  thick forearms. The unassuming maid is poised  
z2hgtFBBbxk,393440,399440,between action and introspection. She is slowly  pouring milk into a squat earthenware vessel  
z2hgtFBBbxk,399440,405440,"commonly known as a ""Dutch Oven"". Her concentration  and careful pouring, suggest she is following a  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,405440,412160,"precise recipe. The Dutch Oven has a deep rim, so  a lid can be put on top for cooking. In front of  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,412160,418080,the pot are broken pieces of stale bread. It is  thought she is making some kind of bread pudding.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,418080,423360,"Her transformation of stale, unusable bread  into something edible, and her careful use  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,423360,428960,"of ingredients, would have been picked up by the  17th-century Dutch as an illustration of ""Domestic  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,428960,435280,"Virtue"", a greatly admired value. We don't know  who the model is but Vermeer couldn't afford  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,435280,443120,"to pay models, so used his family and servants. It  could be Tanneke Everpoel, a maid in Vermeer's house,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,443120,449919,"but if it, is it is not meant to be a ""portrait"".  Vermeer is really showing his astounding ability  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,449920,456240,to suggest a vast range of textures. The rough  inexpensive material is a sharp contrast to his  
z2hgtFBBbxk,456240,461919,"later paintings of middle-class women. After the  ""Milk Maid"" Vermeer never again painted a working  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,461920,468800,"class theme. The maid is wearing a starched cap.  He has painted wet-on-wet here, as well as on  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,468800,474560,"other areas such as her sleeves, then he adds  texture with layers of thick paint or ""Impasto"".  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,475440,481200,The arm is a master class in wet-on-wet technique.  The rolled-up sleeves revealing a perfectly  
z2hgtFBBbxk,481200,488080,"rendered ""tan line"". The edges of her forearms are  soft suggesting movement. We can feel the tension  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,488080,494720,"she has to maintain to let the milk pour out so  slowly, and we can also sense the liquid falling."
z2hgtFBBbxk,497040,499440,It really is as if her arms are moving.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,500960,504639,"He would do something similar with  the guitar strings in this painting,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,505280,511840,"covered in my video: ""Great art Cities: London"".  The maid is wearing a yellow chamois leather top,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,511840,517599,"painted with ""Lead tin yellow"", the brightest yellow  pigment available in Vermeer's time, and one of  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,517599,523680,his preferred colours. He would use the same yellow  pigment in later representations of the famous fur  
z2hgtFBBbxk,523680,529760,"trimmed morning jackets, adorned by elegant women.  The rough reddish stitching is not meant to be  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,529760,537120,"decorative, and tells us it is a purely practical  garment. She wears a heavy blue apron over a red  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,537120,543520,"wool skirt, which suggests that the picture was  painted in winter. In Vermeer's day there were  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,543520,549760,"a limited number of pigments, and he only used  about 20 of them, but along with lead-tin yellow  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,549760,556960,"he did use expensive ""Ultramarine"" a lot. It was made  from crushed lapis lazuli, a semi-precious stone  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,556960,562800,imported from present-day Afghanistan. We know  Vermeer struggled financially most of his life  
z2hgtFBBbxk,562800,568800,"and we think it was his patron Pieter van Ruijven, who supplied the artist with such costly pigment.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,569440,574400,"T  he strange green sleeves are called ""Morsemouwen""  or ""mess sleeves"". They are not part  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,574400,579840,"of the yellow bodice, but are worn separately to  protect against staining, we can see them in other  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,579840,586640,"works. Rather than under drawing Vermeer used a  monochromatic layer where he would identify tone,"
z2hgtFBBbxk,586640,592080,"lighting, and composition. He uses different blocks  of colour for different areas of the painting,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,592080,598960,"which adds to the luminosity. Vermeer famously  uses a sort of ""pointillism"" in the bread and basket  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,598960,605520,which suggests light as it flickers off the broken  surface of the stale bread. He uses dabs of ochre  
z2hgtFBBbxk,605520,612160,"to show us the rough edges of the dry bread, giving  us a texture which suggests staleness. We first  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,612160,618000,"see his use of ""pointilé"" in this painting, and the  technique appears in about half of Vermeer's works.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,618880,624000,"The entire ""still-life"" on the table is a  masterpiece, that uses a combination of thin  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,624000,631372,"glazes, impasto, colour, and a perfect depiction of  light refraction, on every single crumb.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,631961,639840,"Unusually for the time, Vermeer uses impressionistic dabs  of blue here, which act as reflective highlights and  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,639840,645840,intensifies the brick color of the stoneware.  Kitchen maids were often portrayed in Dutch  
z2hgtFBBbxk,645840,651360,"paintings and literature as ""Discreet objects  of desire"" and sexually threatening to the home.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,652400,657280,"Vermeer possibly acknowledged the tradition of  ""the maid as a sexual being"", by placing one of  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,657280,664000,"the Delft tiles behind her, depicting Cupid.  It is thought that she is in a cold kitchen  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,664000,669840,because here we can see a foot warmer. These were  wooden perforated boxes with hot coals inside.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,669840,675440,"There is a possibility Vermeer was using the  foot warmer symbolically, as in popular literature  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,675440,681440,they were often associated with the heat of sex.  More likely he is referring to her inner warmth.
z2hgtFBBbxk,683520,688640,The 17th-century male viewer would have noticed  the contrast of the rough leather sleeves with  
z2hgtFBBbxk,688640,694880,"the fleshy nudity of her exposed forearm, which  they would have found ""titillating"". While we  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,694880,700720,"can't dismiss this erotic subtext, I do believe  that Vermeer, though not from the servant class,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,700720,706079,"did marry above his station, and treats the  subject of a lower-class woman with dignity  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,706080,713200,"and empathy. Vermeer's focus is on the maid  as an ""ideal woman"", a paragon of homely virtue.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,713200,720560,"She might be seen, even today, as the essence of  the Dutch character: Strong, simple and direct.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,721920,727519,"The painting is built up along two diagonal lines  that draw our attention to the pouring milk,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,727520,734640,"the focal point for both us, and the maid. On the wall  are a frame, a bread basket, and a pail. They each  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,734640,740960,"retain their own distinct form and texture, but  they also cascade down towards the stream of milk.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,740960,744880,"The painting is from a low angle  which gives her ""monumentality"".  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,745680,750240,"Vermeer uses the classic pyramid shape as  stability, which I have discussed before.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,750800,757120,"He not only used the same props again and again in  his paintings, but he also recycled the same poses.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,757120,762080,"This is a pose we have seen before in THIS  painting, but although the upper-class woman  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,762080,767040,"is surrounded by expensive furnishings and  the kitchen maid has nothing but her clothes,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,767040,773759,"both women command our respect. This x-ray shows  us that originally, Vermeer had an overflowing  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,773760,779600,"clothes basket here, but painted over it. He  also had a map on the wall behind the maid.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,780400,785840,"By taking these away, and leaving the white-washed  wall, it not only isolates the figures, but also  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,785840,790720,reflects light and cleanliness. If we  look again at this painting we can see  
z2hgtFBBbxk,790720,796079,"there are dirty dishes waiting to be cleaned,  suggesting the servant is lazy and disorganized.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,796720,801839,"If Vermeer had left a full laundry basket, he  would be telling a different story, and by removing  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,801840,808080,"this, and the map, he creates an uncluttered  backdrop - both physically and psychologically.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,808800,814399,"Vermeer often placed a chair or table or curtain  in the foreground of his paintings, to create  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,814400,819680,"a theatrical barrier, and reinforce the sense  of privacy between the figures and the viewer.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,819680,825360,It also adds depth and three-dimensionality.  We can see the type of window if we look at  
z2hgtFBBbxk,825360,832240,"this painting Vermeer created of his aunt's house.  Windows in the 17th-century had small, uneven panes.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,833120,837760,"Top left lighting is an artistic  convention, that goes back to Ancient Rome,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,837760,844320,"and as we've seen, the windows in Vermeer's works  are almost always to the left. In this painting he  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,844320,849920,"shows them as full of imperfections and they are  not clear, leading to a more diffused softer light.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,850480,856576,"My favourite detail is this cracked pane, which  lets in a little beam of unfiltered light. "
z2hgtFBBbxk,857449,862319,"Light is of course what Vermeer is famous for,  and the flow of light, from left to right  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,862320,869040,and its intensity activates the canvas. The  light gradually (and perfectly) diminishes  
z2hgtFBBbxk,869040,875440,"as it flows from light to dark, and every  nail, hole , crack, and crevice is treated  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,875440,880560,with the same attention to detail as the  pouring milk. Vermeer takes a white wall  
z2hgtFBBbxk,880560,886160,"and elevates it to a ""picture-within-a-picture"", a  stage-setting for the artist's quiet little drama."
z2hgtFBBbxk,890320,895520,The amount of work Vermeer produced was pretty  meagre and when he died his work was owned by  
z2hgtFBBbxk,895520,901520,just one or two collectors in the small town of  Delft. The lack of exposure ensured that his name  
z2hgtFBBbxk,901520,908880,"just disappears from art history - completely - until  1866, when a French art critic wrote about him.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,909520,914640,Photography was just becoming popular at this time  and people couldn't help but connect Vermeer's  
z2hgtFBBbxk,914640,920880,"hyper-realistic work with the new technology.  Almost immediately, the suggestion arose that  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,920880,927520,"Vermeer used a ""Camera Obscura' the forerunner of  the modern photographic camera, as a way of copying.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,928160,934160,"A darkened room has a pinhole on one side and  through this hole, an inverted image is projected -  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,934160,941759,"via a lens - into a darkened space, onto a canvas  inside. Now the question is: Did Vermeer use one  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,941760,947520,"to create his work? The pro camera argument  is the lack of underdrawings in his work, the  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,947520,954000,"perfect perspective, and the portrayal of objects  out of focus. Like every theory there are endless  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,954000,961600,"variations. The artist David Hockney famously  made his case on the matter, and in the 2013 film  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,961600,967440,"""Tim's Vermeer"" they claimed to reproduce a Vermeer.  You can find links to these and counter theories  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,967440,973520,"in my video description. As we know plenty  of great artists didn't rely on underdrawing,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,973520,978960,"and if Vermeer did rely on a Camera Obscura to  trace an image, then there WOULD be an underdrawing.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,979760,984800,"The strongest argument for his use of ""mechanical  help"" is his extremely accurate perspective.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,985440,989360,"Along with the hyper-realism,  people asked: ""How is this possible?""  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,990240,994240,Recent evidence shows that he used  a more rudimentary method to obtain  
z2hgtFBBbxk,994240,1001520,"accurate perspective. So far pin pricks have  been found in 13 Vermeer paintings, including  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1001520,1008240,"""The Milkmaid"" just above her right hand. In fact  it is visible to the naked eye - as we can see.  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1009040,1013759,"A string with chalk on it was attached to the  pin, which the painter would have snapped to get  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1013760,1019920,perspective lines. A common method among Dutch  artists. My question is: Why would Vermeer use  
z2hgtFBBbxk,1019920,1025360,"this method to work out perspective, if he was  simply ""tracing the image"" with a camera obscura?  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1026800,1032240,"Of course there is a possibility he used optical  aids of some kind, but I'm not convinced, and there  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1032240,1039399,"is no solid evidence. To be frank, I don't  think it's that important, if it is true, it is just one"
z2hgtFBBbxk,1039399,1045040,process of making a painting and  doesn't detract from Vermeer's unique genius.
z2hgtFBBbxk,1048880,1054000,"The introduction of quiet everyday scenes of  life unfolding in private households, was among  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1054000,1060880,the most striking innovations of the Dutch golden  age. Vermeer infused his scenes of daily life with  
z2hgtFBBbxk,1060880,1067200,layer upon layer of meaning. We come out with  more questions than answers - and that's exciting.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,1068480,1076720,"There is an intriguing ""mystery"" about ""The Milkmaid""  that keeps us coming back. In 1672, France invaded  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1076720,1082640,the Netherlands and Vermeer fell victim to  the disastrous economic climate that followed.  
z2hgtFBBbxk,1082640,1089360,"The art market collapsed overnight, and he would  die just three years later, leaving behind a wife,  "
z2hgtFBBbxk,1089360,1096320,"11 children, and enormous debts. His large  family had to sell everything - just to survive.  "
