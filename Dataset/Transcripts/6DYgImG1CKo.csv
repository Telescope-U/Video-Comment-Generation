6DYgImG1CKo,150,2640,- The human brain is not built to deal
6DYgImG1CKo,2640,5460,with more than about five to nine options.
6DYgImG1CKo,5460,8360,"After that, the brain just spaces out."
6DYgImG1CKo,8360,9540,You choose nobody.
6DYgImG1CKo,9540,11690,"Hi, I'm Dr. Helen Fisher."
6DYgImG1CKo,11690,13450,I'm a biological anthropologist.
6DYgImG1CKo,13450,14300,I study love.
6DYgImG1CKo,14300,15891,And this is Love Support.
6DYgImG1CKo,15891,18474,[upbeat music]
6DYgImG1CKo,20240,22376,This person calls herself Ruth Bader.
6DYgImG1CKo,22377,25930,"""Love at first sight is probably bull [beep], right?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,25930,26763,Wrong.
6DYgImG1CKo,26763,29550,Love at first sight is extremely easy to explain.
6DYgImG1CKo,29550,30830,"This is a brain system,"
6DYgImG1CKo,30830,33330,"it's like the fear system or the anger system,"
6DYgImG1CKo,33330,35210,and it can be triggered instantly.
6DYgImG1CKo,35210,36329,"You gotta be ready for it,"
6DYgImG1CKo,36330,39300,"and we all carry in our head what I call a love map,"
6DYgImG1CKo,39300,41130,an unconscious and conscious list
6DYgImG1CKo,41130,43150,of what you're looking for in a partner.
6DYgImG1CKo,43150,46000,"But the moment comes, you're ready to fall in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,46000,48860,"you see somebody from across the crowded room, or wherever,"
6DYgImG1CKo,48860,50550,"they fit within your love map,"
6DYgImG1CKo,50550,51710,"you go over and you speak to them,"
6DYgImG1CKo,51710,53129,"they smile sweetly at you,"
6DYgImG1CKo,53130,55750,"they say something that's funny or charming or interesting,"
6DYgImG1CKo,55750,59640,"and boom, instantly triggered that brain circuitry"
6DYgImG1CKo,59640,60800,for romantic love.
6DYgImG1CKo,60800,64170,"Attachment, that other brain system, grows slowly."
6DYgImG1CKo,64170,65590,You have to get to know somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,65590,66770,to begin to feel attachment.
6DYgImG1CKo,66770,69180,"But romantic love can be instant, yes."
6DYgImG1CKo,69180,70597,This is from issyleen.
6DYgImG1CKo,70597,72267,"""Who created love?"
6DYgImG1CKo,72267,73759,"""This shit is too much to handle."""
6DYgImG1CKo,73760,74840,"Well, love evolved."
6DYgImG1CKo,74840,77869,"For millions of years we have formed partnerships,"
6DYgImG1CKo,77870,79500,"pair bonding, or monogamy."
6DYgImG1CKo,79500,82610,"Mono means one and gamy means spouse, one spouse."
6DYgImG1CKo,82610,84310,That's all it means to scientists.
6DYgImG1CKo,84310,87170,"People are also adulterous, but they form partnerships."
6DYgImG1CKo,87170,90580,97% of mammals do not pair up to rear their young.
6DYgImG1CKo,90580,93180,People do. It's a hallmark of the human animal.
6DYgImG1CKo,93180,95340,And along with the evolution of pair bonding
6DYgImG1CKo,95340,98969,came the evolution of the human brain systems
6DYgImG1CKo,98970,101170,"for the sex drive, romantic love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,101170,102530,and feelings of deep attachment.
6DYgImG1CKo,102530,105270,I and my colleagues have put 15 people into a brain scanner
6DYgImG1CKo,105270,106820,"who had just been rejected in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,106820,110320,"and the brain goes, just the wiring just goes crazy."
6DYgImG1CKo,110320,112830,"I mean, when you're madly in love with somebody"
6DYgImG1CKo,112830,115360,"and you've been dumped, it's one of the worst experiences."
6DYgImG1CKo,115360,118150,"I mean, people pine for love, they live for love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,118150,121130,"they kill for love, and they die for love."
6DYgImG1CKo,121130,124490,"And I do think that it is an addiction,"
6DYgImG1CKo,124490,126979,"because we found activity in a particular brain region,"
6DYgImG1CKo,126980,128610,it's called the nucleus accumbens.
6DYgImG1CKo,128610,130580,That particular brain region is active
6DYgImG1CKo,130580,132930,"in all of the addictions, all the substance addictions,"
6DYgImG1CKo,132930,134909,"all the behavioral addictions like gambling,"
6DYgImG1CKo,134910,136490,and it becomes just as active
6DYgImG1CKo,136490,138067,when you've been rejected in love.
6DYgImG1CKo,138067,139357,"And when this person says,"
6DYgImG1CKo,139357,140860,"""This shit is too much to handle."""
6DYgImG1CKo,140860,142200,"Well, we all do handle it."
6DYgImG1CKo,142200,144290,The vast majority of us do get over it.
6DYgImG1CKo,144290,147469,And I've been able to prove in the brain that time does heal
6DYgImG1CKo,147470,148920,because it is our survival.
6DYgImG1CKo,148920,150510,It is a survival mechanism.
6DYgImG1CKo,150510,152400,"It evolved millions of years ago,"
6DYgImG1CKo,152400,155430,and it will be with us millions of years from now.
6DYgImG1CKo,155430,158349,"Romantic love is primordial,"
6DYgImG1CKo,158350,160990,"it's adaptable, and it's eternal."
6DYgImG1CKo,160990,163710,"So this shit will always be too much to handle,"
6DYgImG1CKo,163710,165080,but will do it anyway.
6DYgImG1CKo,165080,167193,This person is skzismyuniverse.

6DYgImG1CKo,175720,177260,They're doing it for a lot of people.
6DYgImG1CKo,177260,180290,About 40% of singles in America
6DYgImG1CKo,180290,183200,said that they met their last first date on the internet.
6DYgImG1CKo,183200,185290,"The two mistakes that they make,"
6DYgImG1CKo,185290,187090,perhaps this person is making them to.
6DYgImG1CKo,187090,188730,First mistake is they binge.
6DYgImG1CKo,188730,191530,The human brain is not built to deal

6DYgImG1CKo,194350,197250,"After that, the brain just spaces out."
6DYgImG1CKo,197250,198450,You choose nobody.
6DYgImG1CKo,198450,200239,So the first thing that you've got to do
6DYgImG1CKo,200240,203250,"is after you've met nine people,"
6DYgImG1CKo,203250,204680,"and that's what this person needs to do,"
6DYgImG1CKo,204680,207219,"get off the internet site, get off of it,"
6DYgImG1CKo,207220,210670,and get to know at least one of these people better.
6DYgImG1CKo,210670,212069,"The more you get to know somebody,"
6DYgImG1CKo,212070,213350,the better you tend to like them.
6DYgImG1CKo,213350,215120,"So number one, don't binge."
6DYgImG1CKo,215120,219340,"Number two, think of reasons to say yes instead of no."
6DYgImG1CKo,219340,222840,We have this big brain region linked with negativity bias.
6DYgImG1CKo,222840,225590,We're built to remember the negative.
6DYgImG1CKo,225590,227500,And when you have just met somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,227500,229340,you know so little about them
6DYgImG1CKo,229340,232220,that you overweight those few things that you know.
6DYgImG1CKo,232220,233767,"And so you'll say, ""Oh, I don't know."

6DYgImG1CKo,239490,241890,"I call it positive illusions,"
6DYgImG1CKo,241890,245640,the ability to overlook what you don't like about somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,245640,247410,and focus on what you do.

6DYgImG1CKo,256430,259180,"Sex drive and romantic love or different brain systems,"
6DYgImG1CKo,259180,262019,and you can be mad madly in love with somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,262019,264250,and also sleep around.
6DYgImG1CKo,264250,267070,"As a matter of fact, I do think that the brain"
6DYgImG1CKo,267070,269410,is unfortunately built for both.
6DYgImG1CKo,269410,271400,I've looked at adultery in 40 cultures
6DYgImG1CKo,271400,273600,"and you see it everywhere in the world, even in places"
6DYgImG1CKo,273600,275820,where you could get your head chopped off for it.
6DYgImG1CKo,275820,279330,We seem to have the ability to be madly in love
6DYgImG1CKo,279330,282129,"with some person and deeply attached to that person,"
6DYgImG1CKo,282130,283930,and also sneak around.
6DYgImG1CKo,283930,286990,"I call it a dual human reproductive strategy,"
6DYgImG1CKo,286990,289160,"a tremendous drive to fall in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,289160,292220,"form a partnership, and have your babies, and also to cheat."

6DYgImG1CKo,302420,304110,There's all kinds of cultural reasons.
6DYgImG1CKo,304110,306319,We tend to fall in love when the timing is right.
6DYgImG1CKo,306320,307970,We tend to fall in love with somebody who's around.
6DYgImG1CKo,307970,309330,Proximity is important.
6DYgImG1CKo,309330,310560,We tend to fall in love with somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,310560,313300,"from the same ethnic and socioeconomic background,"
6DYgImG1CKo,313300,315520,somebody of the same level of education.
6DYgImG1CKo,315520,318000,And there's four basic brain systems
6DYgImG1CKo,318000,321200,"that each one of them is associated with a constellation,"
6DYgImG1CKo,321200,323870,"a suite, a group of personality traits:"
6DYgImG1CKo,323870,327380,"dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen systems."
6DYgImG1CKo,327380,330610,I created a questionnaire to see to what degree
6DYgImG1CKo,330610,332340,you express the traits
6DYgImG1CKo,332340,334919,in all four of these basic brain systems.
6DYgImG1CKo,334920,337010,It's now been taken by over 15 million people
6DYgImG1CKo,337010,339140,"in 40 countries, and I'm able to watch"
6DYgImG1CKo,339140,341240,who's naturally drawn to whom.
6DYgImG1CKo,341240,343840,"If you're very high on the traits in the dopamine system,"
6DYgImG1CKo,343840,347820,"risk taking, novelty seeking, curious, creative,"
6DYgImG1CKo,347820,350280,you tend to be drawn to people like yourself.
6DYgImG1CKo,350280,353240,"If you are very high on the traits of the serotonin system,"
6DYgImG1CKo,353240,356669,"you tend to be traditional, conventional, follow the rules,"
6DYgImG1CKo,356670,360300,"respect, authority, detail oriented rather than theoretical."
6DYgImG1CKo,360300,362599,You're also drawn to people like yourself.
6DYgImG1CKo,362600,364270,"So if you're very high testosterone,"
6DYgImG1CKo,364270,368560,"you tend to be analytical, logical, direct, decisive,"
6DYgImG1CKo,368560,371350,"good at things like math, engineering, computers, music,"
6DYgImG1CKo,371350,372490,"music's very structural,"
6DYgImG1CKo,372490,373979,and you're drawn to your opposite.
6DYgImG1CKo,373980,376210,"High estrogen people, and this is men as well as women,"
6DYgImG1CKo,376210,377900,"many more are women in that category,"
6DYgImG1CKo,377900,380620,"they tend to see the big picture, they think long term,"
6DYgImG1CKo,380620,381790,"they're very imaginative,"
6DYgImG1CKo,381790,384420,"very good at reading posture, gesture, tone of voice."
6DYgImG1CKo,384420,386330,We all express all four systems.
6DYgImG1CKo,386330,387530,This is what the problem is
6DYgImG1CKo,387530,389420,with most personality questionnaires today.
6DYgImG1CKo,389420,391420,They put you in one bucket or another.
6DYgImG1CKo,391420,394900,"We express all four brain systems and the traits in each,"
6DYgImG1CKo,394900,397419,but we express some more than others.
6DYgImG1CKo,397420,399250,"Now, there's all kinds of circumstances"
6DYgImG1CKo,399250,401400,where people are drawn to their opposite in ways
6DYgImG1CKo,401400,403350,"because they had a bad love affair,"
6DYgImG1CKo,403350,405030,they've been running around all their lives
6DYgImG1CKo,405030,406580,and now they want something more stable
6DYgImG1CKo,406580,407900,so they go for the traditional
6DYgImG1CKo,407900,409199,even if they're very risk taking.
6DYgImG1CKo,409200,410230,That's human variety.
6DYgImG1CKo,410230,412820,"But the bottom line is there's patterns to culture,"
6DYgImG1CKo,412820,414310,"there's patterns to nature,"

6DYgImG1CKo,530910,533399,and sends dopamine to many brain regions
6DYgImG1CKo,533400,537270,"giving you that focus, the motivation, the obsession,"
6DYgImG1CKo,537270,539840,the craving of intense romantic love.
6DYgImG1CKo,539840,542380,"And what's interesting to me is that little factory,"
6DYgImG1CKo,542380,544730,"the VTA, lies right next to the factory"
6DYgImG1CKo,544730,547079,that orchestrates thirst and hunger.
6DYgImG1CKo,547080,548910,Thirst and hunger keep you alive today.
6DYgImG1CKo,548910,552050,Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy
6DYgImG1CKo,552050,553970,on just one individual at a time
6DYgImG1CKo,553970,555509,and start the mating process
6DYgImG1CKo,555510,558070,and send your DNA into tomorrow.
6DYgImG1CKo,558070,559657,This is from catchmyfly.
6DYgImG1CKo,559657,562126,"""Do you believe in soulmates?"
6DYgImG1CKo,562127,565080,"""If so, do you believe you can have more than one?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,565080,566910,"Yes, and yes."
6DYgImG1CKo,566910,568389,I do believe in soulmates.
6DYgImG1CKo,568390,570980,I do not believe you can have more than one at a time.
6DYgImG1CKo,570980,572459,"So now, what is a soulmate?"
6DYgImG1CKo,572460,574870,I think what this person means
6DYgImG1CKo,574870,577230,is somebody who it's a true love.
6DYgImG1CKo,577230,579260,You're not gonna sleep with other people.
6DYgImG1CKo,579260,581000,You're not thinking of going anywhere.
6DYgImG1CKo,581000,583910,You might even consider dying for him or her.
6DYgImG1CKo,583910,587920,"It is a very deep, genuine attachment,"
6DYgImG1CKo,587920,590320,intense feeling of romantic love.
6DYgImG1CKo,590320,593710,And I think that this is summed up best by a poet
6DYgImG1CKo,593710,596917,from the 15th century in India named Kabir.
6DYgImG1CKo,596917,599507,"""The lane of love is narrow."
6DYgImG1CKo,599507,601320,"""There's room for only one."""
6DYgImG1CKo,601320,603180,"And indeed, when you're madly in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,603180,605050,it's with only one person.
6DYgImG1CKo,605050,606830,I do believe you can have a soulmate.
6DYgImG1CKo,606830,609930,"I think that you may have a series of soulmates,"
6DYgImG1CKo,609930,611500,but I don't think you can have
6DYgImG1CKo,611500,613320,more than one soulmate at a time.
6DYgImG1CKo,613320,615687,From somebody called dancewithvoices.
6DYgImG1CKo,615687,618147,"""Why don't people associate love with the heart?"
6DYgImG1CKo,618147,620410,"""Why not the penis or the sternum?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,620410,622029,There may be a physiological reason
6DYgImG1CKo,622030,623960,"why it has been associated with love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,623960,625930,"and that is there's a lot of characteristics,"
6DYgImG1CKo,625930,627649,"a lot of things happen when you fall madly in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,627650,630410,and one of them is the heart can really pound
6DYgImG1CKo,630410,632430,when you're really nervous about something.
6DYgImG1CKo,632430,633649,"I mean, when you're madly in love,"
6DYgImG1CKo,633650,636840,"not only do you feel that ecstasy, euphoria, sleeplessness,"
6DYgImG1CKo,636840,639610,"loss of appetite, obsessive thinking about the person,"
6DYgImG1CKo,639610,641209,"craving for emotional union,"
6DYgImG1CKo,641210,643860,but also all kinds of physiological responses.
6DYgImG1CKo,643860,646000,"Weak knees maybe, a pounding heart."
6DYgImG1CKo,646000,648770,It really started in the 1300s
6DYgImG1CKo,648770,650120,with Giotto in a painting.
6DYgImG1CKo,650120,651890,"Prior to that, there were a lot of uses"
6DYgImG1CKo,651890,653100,of the shape of the heart.
6DYgImG1CKo,653100,656209,"In fact, as early as 5,000 years ago in the Indus Valley,"
6DYgImG1CKo,656210,658340,they were drawing things that looked like
6DYgImG1CKo,658340,659350,the shape of a heart.
6DYgImG1CKo,659350,661959,And at that point it was the seed
6DYgImG1CKo,661960,666020,of a form of parsley plant or an ivy leaf.
6DYgImG1CKo,666020,668820,But it became associated with romantic love
6DYgImG1CKo,668820,672490,probably with the painting by Giotto in 1309.
6DYgImG1CKo,672490,675927,This is from Jay at 53k1.
6DYgImG1CKo,675927,679187,"""I lust hard and lose interest quick."
6DYgImG1CKo,679187,681440,"""How does that work?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,681440,682890,"Well, you're not ready to fall in love."
6DYgImG1CKo,682890,685540,We've evolved three distinctly different brain systems
6DYgImG1CKo,685540,686880,for mating and reproduction.
6DYgImG1CKo,686880,689310,One is the sex drive linked with testosterone
6DYgImG1CKo,689310,690740,in both men and women.
6DYgImG1CKo,690740,692000,The second is romantic love.
6DYgImG1CKo,692000,693370,We've been able to prove this is linked
6DYgImG1CKo,693370,695510,with the dopamine system in both men and women.
6DYgImG1CKo,695510,697060,"That's what gives you the focus,"
6DYgImG1CKo,697060,698490,"the motivation, the obsession."
6DYgImG1CKo,698490,700520,"And the third brain system is attachment,"
6DYgImG1CKo,700520,702330,that sense of calm and security
6DYgImG1CKo,702330,703940,you can feel with a longterm partner.
6DYgImG1CKo,703940,706740,And this individual he's in the lust stage.
6DYgImG1CKo,706740,708040,He's not ready to fall in love.
6DYgImG1CKo,708040,710220,"You know, you have to be ready to fall in love"
6DYgImG1CKo,710220,711269,"to actually do it,"
6DYgImG1CKo,711270,715200,"and he's just experiencing a different brain system,"
6DYgImG1CKo,715200,716170,the lust system.
6DYgImG1CKo,716170,717860,This question is from gertig.
6DYgImG1CKo,717860,719367,It's a very interesting question.
6DYgImG1CKo,719367,721447,"""Any good data out there on divorce rates"
6DYgImG1CKo,721447,725120,"""for couples that meet via online dating sites?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,725120,728890,"Apparently if you met somebody online,"
6DYgImG1CKo,728890,732230,"as opposed to offline, you're less likely to divorce,"
6DYgImG1CKo,732230,735329,"just by a little, but you are less likely to divorce."
6DYgImG1CKo,735330,739220,"People who date online are more likely to be fully employed,"
6DYgImG1CKo,739220,741490,"more likely to have higher education,"
6DYgImG1CKo,741490,744770,and more likely to be interested in a committed partnership.
6DYgImG1CKo,744770,746087,This is from Raki'a Rae.
6DYgImG1CKo,746087,750190,"""How can you be in love with somebody and jealous of them?"""
6DYgImG1CKo,750190,751170,Easily.
6DYgImG1CKo,751170,752480,"When you're madly in love with somebody,"
6DYgImG1CKo,752480,753850,it's called mate guarding.
6DYgImG1CKo,753850,755440,Other animals do it too.
6DYgImG1CKo,755440,758470,And if you see your partner beginning to flirt
6DYgImG1CKo,758470,761519,"with other individuals, you could lose that partner,"
6DYgImG1CKo,761520,763570,"you could lose your children, you could lose your house,"
6DYgImG1CKo,763570,766030,"you could lose your friends, you could lose your money."
6DYgImG1CKo,766030,768330,"I mean, you know, the game of love matters."
6DYgImG1CKo,768330,770057,This is from LaMattina10.
6DYgImG1CKo,770057,772687,"""Question of the day,"" this person writes."
6DYgImG1CKo,772687,774107,"""Couples that do the this together"
6DYgImG1CKo,774107,776667,"""have 20% more love hormones."
6DYgImG1CKo,776667,777910,"""It's not dirty."""
6DYgImG1CKo,777910,779610,"Well, I don't know what this person has in mind,"
6DYgImG1CKo,779610,781430,but I would say play.
6DYgImG1CKo,781430,782700,When you play with somebody
6DYgImG1CKo,782700,785050,you're driving up the dopamine system in the brain
6DYgImG1CKo,785050,788970,"and that gives you focus, motivation, energy, and optimism."
6DYgImG1CKo,788970,791579,"Play with somebody, stay with somebody."
6DYgImG1CKo,791580,793430,"Oh, that's it. That's all the questions."
6DYgImG1CKo,793430,794620,I enjoyed answering them.
6DYgImG1CKo,794620,795710,Thank you for joining me.
