nR-lsNDVhcY,100,4400,Animal Cell.
nR-lsNDVhcY,31960,33559,Watch out. Risky road ahead.
nR-lsNDVhcY,62920,72299,The Animal cell is surrounded by a semi-permeable cell membrane.
nR-lsNDVhcY,91800,104100,The cell membrane allows only specific materials to move in and out of the cell.
nR-lsNDVhcY,110360,111900,Let me get inside.
nR-lsNDVhcY,113000,115100,"Sorry buddy, Humans are not allowed - Animal cell Team."
nR-lsNDVhcY,120100,120700,Please let me get inside.
nR-lsNDVhcY,120800,124200,The police is chasing me.
nR-lsNDVhcY,126600,127900,"Okay, you are allowed to come inside."
nR-lsNDVhcY,140400,144299,Scanning inside Animal cell.
nR-lsNDVhcY,148000,173500,"The different parts of the cell are called organelles. Nucleus, Mitochondria, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi Apparatus, Lysosomes."
nR-lsNDVhcY,181800,187300,The cytoplasm is a jelly like substance.
nR-lsNDVhcY,196000,203100,Cytoplasm provides a surface for all the organelles in the animal cell.
nR-lsNDVhcY,204000,207300,Let us study these organelles.
nR-lsNDVhcY,209200,211599,Welcome my friend
nR-lsNDVhcY,216200,222000,Mr. Nucleus
nR-lsNDVhcY,223900,227500,My name is Nucleus.
nR-lsNDVhcY,228000,240500,"Being the control center of cell, I decide and control most of the functions going on in the cell."
nR-lsNDVhcY,258799,262599,We are the mitochondria.
nR-lsNDVhcY,262800,270599,We are the sites for cellular respiration in cells.
nR-lsNDVhcY,272540,285200,We are the powerhouses of the cell because we release energy rich compounds called ATP.
nR-lsNDVhcY,290200,298700,"ATP is needed for the functioning, growth and maintenance of the body."
nR-lsNDVhcY,303400,310800,Let us now study about the endoplasmic reticulum.
nR-lsNDVhcY,313800,323199,The endoplasmic reticulum is a large network of membrane bound sheets.
nR-lsNDVhcY,329800,337500,They help in transporting and exchanging materials between the various regions of the cytoplasm.
nR-lsNDVhcY,341800,346300,The endoplasmic reticulum is of two types
nR-lsNDVhcY,346400,351600,The smooth endoplasmic reticulum
nR-lsNDVhcY,353000,355700,The rough endoplasmic reticulum.
nR-lsNDVhcY,359400,365300,The smooth endoplasmic reticulum helps in the formation of lipids.
nR-lsNDVhcY,366600,371400,Lipids are essential components of the cell membrane.
nR-lsNDVhcY,374000,383800,The rough endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes.
nR-lsNDVhcY,396200,402800,Ribosomes help in building proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
nR-lsNDVhcY,416200,424500,The proteins go to the golgi apparatus.
nR-lsNDVhcY,433200,438100,The protein is processed inside the golgi apparatus.
nR-lsNDVhcY,441000,442300,Observe the other side.
nR-lsNDVhcY,446600,452000,The proteins are packaged and sent outside.
nR-lsNDVhcY,460300,466800,The golgi apparatus is involved in the formation of lysosomes.
nR-lsNDVhcY,470600,479100,The lysosomes contain powerful digestive enzymes that help in cell digestion.
nR-lsNDVhcY,494500,496200,The cell is damaged.
nR-lsNDVhcY,496900,498300,You must leave.
nR-lsNDVhcY,508500,509800,The cell is damaged.
nR-lsNDVhcY,512400,527100,"When the cell is damaged, the lysosome bursts."
nR-lsNDVhcY,532400,538900,"After the lysosome bursts, digestive enzymes get released."
nR-lsNDVhcY,543700,548000,The digestive enzymes digest their own cell.
nR-lsNDVhcY,552600,557399,"Hence, lysosomes are called suicide bags of the cell."
