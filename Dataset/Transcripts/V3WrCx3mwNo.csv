V3WrCx3mwNo,300750,304140,"cut from a different cloth. They think that they're, they're literally a different"
V3WrCx3mwNo,304140,307590,breed than them and that they're and that they can't get those things. So
V3WrCx3mwNo,307590,312360,that's kind of interesting right and it's always kind of a shocker to have
V3WrCx3mwNo,312360,319069,"the, the myth of that person burst but see here's the thing."

V3WrCx3mwNo,330780,335010,No one wants you to succeed right? Only your mom and even your mom doesn't want you to succeed
V3WrCx3mwNo,335010,341100,cause she's afraid you're not gonna call her back. Your brain doesn't want you to be a
V3WrCx3mwNo,341100,344220,big success. Your brain just wants to keep you alive. All your brain wants you
V3WrCx3mwNo,344220,348030,"to do is just pump out one or two kids so that the DNA can continue on, that's it."
V3WrCx3mwNo,348030,357080,Your brain will trick you. You are your own worst enemy. I know that if I fail to

V3WrCx3mwNo,363650,367960,"to have a big-picture long-term goal. Dudes, talent is overrated homie. There's"
V3WrCx3mwNo,369310,378530,no price too great for me. There's nothing too great. I would die
V3WrCx3mwNo,378530,383840,"for, for my dreams. You know what I'm saying?"
V3WrCx3mwNo,383840,387290,"I'm willing to risk it. There's, there's nothing too great, there's"
V3WrCx3mwNo,387290,395690,no amount that I'm not willing to go but you could accomplish anything you want man.
V3WrCx3mwNo,395690,399050,If you're willing to do it. Right? But again you'll realize that what you think
V3WrCx3mwNo,399050,402909,you are is not what you are. You become something else. You literally become
V3WrCx3mwNo,402910,408170,something else. If you want to be someone who's tireless
V3WrCx3mwNo,408170,412160,"you cannot be tired down, you'll become something else. So you don't have those"
V3WrCx3mwNo,412160,415610,"limitations a normal human being has, you don't have that because you become"
V3WrCx3mwNo,415610,418699,something else. You become something that embodies certain things that you're trying
V3WrCx3mwNo,418700,422180,"to move forward. You'll go to any length you, so you're not going get tired because"
V3WrCx3mwNo,422180,426699,"that because do that, at that point you have God on your side. That's not even you anymore dude."
V3WrCx3mwNo,428509,433049,"It's like, you know how? What I do is I focus on maybe one or two or three"
V3WrCx3mwNo,433049,437879,things at a time and then I just do it and then I get that done and then I do
V3WrCx3mwNo,437879,443389,the next thing and then I get that done and then I do the next thing. No one's
V3WrCx3mwNo,444259,448199,"going to put you on. You got, you have to put yourself on. No one's going to put"
V3WrCx3mwNo,448199,452189,"you on. So, so you make that choice you just do your small tasks and you do it but see"
V3WrCx3mwNo,452189,455509,no one wants to hear that. Success is about just quiet little actions. Getting
V3WrCx3mwNo,456860,462119,rid of anything that's unnecessary. Success is like a quiet daily set of
V3WrCx3mwNo,462119,475259,"tasks, real small. Real real small."
V3WrCx3mwNo,475259,483029,It's very quiet. It's a very quiet process where
V3WrCx3mwNo,483029,485459,you're just drawing your state from within yourself doing these like simple little
V3WrCx3mwNo,485459,489569,tasks but finding love in those simple little tasks. It's not this big rah-rah
V3WrCx3mwNo,489569,493610,speech where you do this one thing and something big happens.
V3WrCx3mwNo,495430,500199,I'm tired. I don't want to do it and I got a million reasons not to do it but what I
V3WrCx3mwNo,500200,503620,"do is I make the choice that I say if I can't make myself go do this, how am I"
V3WrCx3mwNo,503620,510669,"going to live my dreams? I found that if I miss one day, I'll miss every day."
V3WrCx3mwNo,510670,525040,"people are always wondering what the next step in life is and I say,"
V3WrCx3mwNo,525040,529300,"ife's a little bit like a maze, you know? Until you walk down one hallway and try to open the door"
V3WrCx3mwNo,529300,534399,you don't know if it's a dead end or not and people are trying to sit back
V3WrCx3mwNo,534400,538930,and that's where the procrastination comes in and look real far down
V3WrCx3mwNo,538930,546089,"the hallway, and I'm like, just walk"
V3WrCx3mwNo,546090,557070,small and steady wins the race what's the fastest way to change your life?
V3WrCx3mwNo,557070,562440,for me I think it's understanding how to set up daily routines with alternating brain and body training
V3WrCx3mwNo,562440,569960,"and, killing procrastination"
V3WrCx3mwNo,571029,576339,"The little win, with your family when you feel like watching TV"
V3WrCx3mwNo,576339,581649,sets you up for another win the next day a little win of getting up at 5 o'clock
V3WrCx3mwNo,581649,588550,"and running your morning routine sets you up for a habit, of a 5am club morning routine"
V3WrCx3mwNo,588550,595899,small daily improvements over time will lead you to stunning results
V3WrCx3mwNo,595899,599740,"it comes down to this Elvis, I think you have to work hard like, just so everybody knows"
V3WrCx3mwNo,599740,604060,"we haven't gotten into this subject yet working hard, is the cost of entry to anything"
V3WrCx3mwNo,604060,608920,you know zero people that are successful that don't work their face off
V3WrCx3mwNo,608920,613180,"you know zero people now, they may have money as mummy and daddy made money and gave it to them"
V3WrCx3mwNo,613180,617938,but people that actually built their own success you know zero people
V3WrCx3mwNo,617939,625310,"that have had success, that did not put in obnoxious amounts of work"
V3WrCx3mwNo,625310,633029,what's the most important key to success? I think it's hunger
V3WrCx3mwNo,633029,637529,"it's not getting satisfied a hunger that doesn't go, a hunger to learn, a hunger to grow, a hunger to serve,"
V3WrCx3mwNo,637529,641670,a hunger to give a hunger to create break throughs
V3WrCx3mwNo,641670,643740,most people are hungry until they make a certain amount of money and then they get comfortable
V3WrCx3mwNo,643740,647100,"and there's nothing wrong with that but it's not about the money,"
V3WrCx3mwNo,647100,651300,"t's not about the business, it's about your growth because every one of us either grows or dies"
V3WrCx3mwNo,651300,654300,"people ask me all the time, what does it take to be happy? I say one word, progress"
V3WrCx3mwNo,654300,659519,progress equals happiness because achieving a goal feels
V3WrCx3mwNo,659519,662970,"good for how long? A week, a month, three months? And then there needs to"
V3WrCx3mwNo,662970,666350,be something else and the reason for something else is because you gotta grow
V3WrCx3mwNo,666350,674160,"imagine a conversation with your future self and that, lets imagine that"
V3WrCx3mwNo,674160,680579,"the you of 20 years from now shows up at your doorstep, and that you"
V3WrCx3mwNo,680579,687089,"is stronger, smarter, wiser, wealthier, healthier, happier and that you shows up at your door"
V3WrCx3mwNo,687089,692100,and it looks at your life and it looks you in the eye
V3WrCx3mwNo,692100,698160,"if that future you is going to give you advice on what to stop, what to start"
V3WrCx3mwNo,698160,701720,what's the first thing they would tell you to be? Or do?
V3WrCx3mwNo,701890,705730,take a step back right now and think about who we all admire in the world
V3WrCx3mwNo,705730,710110,"right? They're all people that punted the system, they're people that practice singing since they were"
V3WrCx3mwNo,710110,713829,"five, there are people that shot 10,000 basketballs every morning"
V3WrCx3mwNo,713829,719230,it's always that it's always that. 99% of the people
V3WrCx3mwNo,719230,722649,right now that are listening to this are playing in the middle
V3WrCx3mwNo,722649,726820,"they're playing in a game that was structured for them they're risk adverse, they fear, and most"
V3WrCx3mwNo,726820,733629,"importantly, they fear what other people think"
V3WrCx3mwNo,734629,741720,"look, I believe that we're all born with lots of goodness in us but life throws curveballs"
V3WrCx3mwNo,741720,749069,"life, the ambition of being alive, helps us dream, and if you've been given a dream"
V3WrCx3mwNo,749069,754519,don't discount that because you're not good enough yet
V3WrCx3mwNo,754519,759209,"develop yourself, weaponise yourself teach yourself to be so good at"
V3WrCx3mwNo,759209,764819,something that is necessary to serve in the area of your dream that now you're
V3WrCx3mwNo,764819,769558,never even thinking about your comfort zones your comfort zone is irrelevant
V3WrCx3mwNo,769559,773519,"what matters is, what are you trying to do with your life? How are you trying to contribute?"
V3WrCx3mwNo,773519,781889,"The one thing that discipline definitely does help you with, is it helps you get things done"
V3WrCx3mwNo,781889,787860,"and when you get things done, when you actually do things you have more success"
V3WrCx3mwNo,787860,793678,"if you have more success, and sometimes a big"
V3WrCx3mwNo,793679,797699,part of success is just not being lazy and just doing it it's like 90% of it is just showing up
V3WrCx3mwNo,797699,802259,"get there and start working, like you're not gonna feel perfect everyday"
V3WrCx3mwNo,802259,806128,it's pretty much the same with everybody that actually gets good at something
V3WrCx3mwNo,806129,810989,there's gotta be those days you push through
V3WrCx3mwNo,810989,814139,and they're probably gonna be more numerous
V3WrCx3mwNo,814139,818938,than the days you don't and so the benefit of discipline in my eyes has always been
V3WrCx3mwNo,818939,825169,that through discipline I get things done.
V3WrCx3mwNo,826040,838649,Those days when I’m tired or worn out or just basically sick of the grind. What
V3WrCx3mwNo,838650,849600,do I do on those days? I go anyways. I get it done even if I’m just going
V3WrCx3mwNo,849600,856259,through the motions. I go through the motions.
V3WrCx3mwNo,856260,860550,"So yep you're in school, yes you probably are getting grades, etc but if"
V3WrCx3mwNo,860550,864450,"it's not meaningful to you, if it's not important to you then you're not going to"
V3WrCx3mwNo,864450,868710,make it a priority. So what you have to do is find out how can you make it
V3WrCx3mwNo,868710,873090,meaningful? How can you make it purposeful? How can how can you make it stick and
V3WrCx3mwNo,873090,876810,"when you can find that out I promise you you will get up early, you'll get there"
V3WrCx3mwNo,876810,881660,"first and you'll do whatever it takes to make that goal a reality. So for me, no"
V3WrCx3mwNo,881660,886998,"such thing as procrastination, it's such thing as it's not a priority to you."
V3WrCx3mwNo,886999,892259,This is kinda hard to understand but sometimes you can try so hard at something
V3WrCx3mwNo,892259,902850,sometimes you can be so so prepared and still fail
V3WrCx3mwNo,904880,915170,and with every time you fail it's painful causes sadness
V3WrCx3mwNo,915170,919209,and especially as I saw last night it causes disappointment
V3WrCx3mwNo,921620,928920,I've often said a man's character is not judged after he celebrates a victory but
V3WrCx3mwNo,928920,935910,by what he does when his back is against the wall
V3WrCx3mwNo,935910,938660,so no matter how great the setback
V3WrCx3mwNo,939310,947100,how severe the failure you never give up
V3WrCx3mwNo,947100,951990,"you never give up, you pick yourself up, you brush yourself off, you push forward,"
V3WrCx3mwNo,951990,954500,"you move on, you adapt, you overcome, that is what I believe"
V3WrCx3mwNo,960180,971600,"everybody here, everybody watching, I won't be stopped, I can't be stopped"
V3WrCx3mwNo,971600,976500,"you're either committed, or you aren't you're either willing to do everything it takes"
V3WrCx3mwNo,976500,982100,whatever that might be or you aren't you either are willing to go
V3WrCx3mwNo,982100,987600,through hell and high water and fire and brimstone to get to your goals
V3WrCx3mwNo,987600,998130,"or you aren't. Work on yourself, work on your focus you cannot stop, you gotta work"
V3WrCx3mwNo,998130,1003620,"the problem with you is you see difficult, as something negative"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1003620,1007990,I want you to see difficult differently. Are you hearing me? I need you to push through that stuff
V3WrCx3mwNo,1007990,1014570,"push through it. You can get through it the more you go through, the more difficult it is"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1014570,1020120,"the more challenging it is listen to me, the harder it is"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1020120,1024530,are you hearing me? The more challenging it is all you're doing baby is building muscle
V3WrCx3mwNo,1024530,1031459,"in life, you're either going through a storm in a storm, or you're coming out"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1031459,1037370,it's a part of life. There's no way around it so just be careful not to allow
V3WrCx3mwNo,1037370,1041420,the trials and tribulations to consume you. I don't care if you're a billionaire
V3WrCx3mwNo,1041420,1045380,"I don't care if you're a CEO of one of the most important companies, I don't care if you're an"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1045380,1052010,"entertainer, like I don't care who you are, you can go to the moon"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1052010,1054590,we all have problems what I'm trying to tell you is this though
V3WrCx3mwNo,1054590,1059730,problems are a part of life but guess what
V3WrCx3mwNo,1059730,1065398,they're not life. It's not going to be easy. There are moments when you are going to doubt yourself
V3WrCx3mwNo,1065399,1069539,there are rough times are gonna come but they have not come to stay
V3WrCx3mwNo,1069539,1077100,no matter how bad it is or how bad it gets

V3WrCx3mwNo,1103180,1109510,You know and I think it started with trying to please my mother and trying to
V3WrCx3mwNo,1109510,1115090,please my grandmother and they always wanted higher for me. They always wanted
V3WrCx3mwNo,1115090,1120549,more for me and it got to the point that I wanted to be something. I wanted to be
V3WrCx3mwNo,1120550,1129540,"somebody and it made me choose certain roles, it made me turn down certain roles"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1129540,1137740,there is more than an image that I want to project. I want to be the person that
V3WrCx3mwNo,1137740,1142770,is the first person there and the last person to leave. That's what I want to be
V3WrCx3mwNo,1142770,1149970,because I think that the the road to success is through commitment and
V3WrCx3mwNo,1149970,1156070,through the strength to drive through that commitment when it gets hard and it
V3WrCx3mwNo,1156070,1159159,is going to get hard and you're going to want to quit sometimes but it'll be
V3WrCx3mwNo,1159160,1166360,colored by who you are and more who you want to be. I definitely found that
V3WrCx3mwNo,1166360,1174519,wanting to be an actor stems from wanting to be somebody.
V3WrCx3mwNo,1174519,1179929,My mom wanted me be a truck driver because that would mean I would make

V3WrCx3mwNo,1184399,1188450,made and she thought that would happen but something inside of me said I don't want
V3WrCx3mwNo,1188450,1191960,to drive a truck. There's something else that matters more to me and I decided I was
V3WrCx3mwNo,1191960,1198888,not going to go for money instead of passion and the rewards been pretty
V3WrCx3mwNo,1198889,1201500,amazingly better than being a truck drive. It's not bad being a truck driver it's just
V3WrCx3mwNo,1201500,1205070,"not what I was after and I, I look back and one of the things that helped me was"

V3WrCx3mwNo,1219200,1222950,better you've got to get better. It's the only way it happens and luck will show up for
V3WrCx3mwNo,1222950,1227120,people and it will leave them but if you're constantly improving who you are and
V3WrCx3mwNo,1227120,1233389,"what you give, game over. See if you can find some ways to"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1233389,1237520,multiply your value to the market
V3WrCx3mwNo,1237520,1243970,and he said your income will immediately start to change. See if you go through

V3WrCx3mwNo,1249370,1254530,"all we can do? Most of us will have to answer, no we haven't. We've been holding"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1254530,1258610,"back. We have ideas that we don't act on things we want to do, we're afraid to take"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1258610,1262660,"chances, we go through life trying to seek security and not coming outside of"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1262660,1269559,our comfort zone and we take most of our stuff with us to the grave. Up until then

V3WrCx3mwNo,1283360,1288160,"then my question was if it isn't going to change, how will my life ever change"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1288160,1295120,"and here's what my teacher taught me. When you change, when you change,"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1295120,1300130,everything will change for you and I'm saying that the fact that you're still here
V3WrCx3mwNo,1300130,1304690,that you're still breathing you've got some more work and you owe it
V3WrCx3mwNo,1304690,1307779,to yourself. You owe it to yourself so when you get up in the morning that you
V3WrCx3mwNo,1307780,1314550,can look yourself in the face and say hey I'm living my life on my terms.
V3WrCx3mwNo,1314550,1321040,"Change your question, change your life. When it comes to planning your life I want to"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1321040,1324160,get you to learn to ask three questions now. The question you want to ask yourself is
V3WrCx3mwNo,1324160,1327429,what do I want? What's my outcome? What's my result? The
V3WrCx3mwNo,1327429,1332260,word R.P.M. The first one is to get you focused on the target. The target is
V3WrCx3mwNo,1332260,1336360,"not the activity, the activity can change. Its what the - what's the result I'm after."
V3WrCx3mwNo,1336360,1340840,"If you know exactly what it is you really want, what you desire, what you're"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1340840,1346278,"really after, clarity is power. The more clear you are in specifically what you want"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1346279,1350510,the faster your brain can get you there but if you're generally saying things
V3WrCx3mwNo,1350510,1354169,"like what do I want, 'well you know I want more money', 'fine, here's a dollar get out"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1354169,1358100,of here.' Whether you get the outcome or not
V3WrCx3mwNo,1358100,1363110,whether you get that result will be based firstly of clarity and the second
V3WrCx3mwNo,1363110,1366860,thing is whether you get enough emotional juice to keep going after it
V3WrCx3mwNo,1366860,1371240,"when things don't work out. Did you achieve the outcome? Yeah, when you're"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1371240,1373940,"that general, you might be - you think you're not getting your goal, you are. The way"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1373940,1378080,"you language your goal, the way you think about it, you're receiving it. You know"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1378080,1386090,"you know, I, you know I want to feel a bit better. I want to lose some weight"

V3WrCx3mwNo,1390279,1394340,better for you and that's where I picked up that phrase: for
V3WrCx3mwNo,1394340,1398720,"things to change, you've got to change. You don't have to change the marketplace"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1398720,1404120,"you don't have to change the marketing plan, you don't have to change the"

V3WrCx3mwNo,1437960,1444390,"to you of their own accord. Here's my best advice: welcome all experiences, you"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1444390,1452590,never know which one is going to turn everything on. Are there going to be some
V3WrCx3mwNo,1452590,1457480,moments when you want to give up? Yes. Will there be some moments when it's
V3WrCx3mwNo,1457480,1462160,"going to seem like it's impossible, the pain that you're experiencing, the"
V3WrCx3mwNo,1462160,1465820,disappointment that you're experiencing that you're going to say it's not worth
