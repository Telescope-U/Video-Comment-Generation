0VI57viMdps,320,7680,We can trust God in any circumstance we encounter  with the assurance found in these three words  
0VI57viMdps,8240,18960,God's got this we can we can overcome we can  have victory we can believe in deliverance we  
0VI57viMdps,18960,28399,can believe in healing we can believe that we can  overcome in any situation as long as we know God's  
0VI57viMdps,28960,35280,got this is there anything that I ever go  through that God don't know about the answer is  
0VI57viMdps,35280,42640,a resounding no is there any situation I ever find  myself in that God's not aware of the answer is a  
0VI57viMdps,42640,50480,resounding no is there any sickness that God can't  heal me of the answer's a resounding no is there  
0VI57viMdps,50480,59040,any situation that my marriage or my family or my  finances can find ourselves in that God can't fix  
0VI57viMdps,59040,70080,and the answer is a resounding no is anything too  hard for God no as believers as children of God  
0VI57viMdps,70880,80479,we know it's going to be okay as long as  we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus Christ  
0VI57viMdps,81680,85840,now if you're looking to the world  right now for help you're depressed
0VI57viMdps,88160,102000,and there is nothing too hard for thee and  there is nothing that's too hard for thee  
0VI57viMdps,103120,111360,is there anything too hard for me what's the  answer to that question that God's asking us  
0VI57viMdps,112160,121200,no nothing too hard for him say it again God's  got this we all have things that come against us  
0VI57viMdps,121760,127760,it's easy to live up tight wondering how it's  going to work out what if the medical report isn't  
0VI57viMdps,127760,134640,good what if my finances don't get better what if  my child doesn't get accepted in that school we've  
0VI57viMdps,134640,141680,tried to figure it out we've done our best but we  don't see anything changing if we're not careful  
0VI57viMdps,141680,148640,we'll live worried discouraged not expecting it  to get better but there's a simple phrase you have  
0VI57viMdps,148640,157200,to keep down in your spirit God's got this he's on  the throne he sees what's happening he already has  
0VI57viMdps,157200,164560,the solution you don't have to figure it out  there may not be a logical answer in the natural  
0VI57viMdps,164560,171520,you don't see a way that's okay we serve a  supernatural God he has ways to do it we've never  
0VI57viMdps,171520,179360,thought of instead of trying to force it to happen  living up tight you have to let go and let god  
0VI57viMdps,180160,186720,when you turn it over to him and say God I  know you've got this I know you're in control  
0VI57viMdps,187280,193920,not only will you feel the heaviness the weight  lift off of you but God will make things happen  
0VI57viMdps,193920,201120,that you couldn't make happen you have many  problems you have many challenges you have many  
0VI57viMdps,201120,208080,questions you have many struggles you need to know  that you have a mighty God because when you face  
0VI57viMdps,208080,214720,mighty problems you need to know that God who  will help you face them is up to the task and  
0VI57viMdps,214720,221520,he is up to the task right now my friend for  God so loved the world he has never messed up  
0VI57viMdps,221520,228240,he has never struggled and he is not messing up  now and he is not struggling now he will help us  
0VI57viMdps,228240,235040,he will help us really what we need to do  during these seasons is focus less on the muscle  
0VI57viMdps,235040,243680,of mankind and more on the muscle of God reach  up and you'll see that our God has got this  
0VI57viMdps,244960,253280,in Psalm chapter 46 and verse number one that  Psalmist David wrote God is our refuge and  
0VI57viMdps,253280,263120,strength a very present help in trouble I've  told you this before but it bears repeating the  
0VI57viMdps,263120,270240,only time and place in your entire bible  that God promises to be a present help  
0VI57viMdps,270240,278639,is when we're in trouble he said I'm going to be  a very present help I'm not going to be a casually  
0VI57viMdps,278640,285440,present help I'm not going to be a spotty present  help I'm not going to be here and there here a  
0VI57viMdps,285440,293200,little there little present help he said I'm going  to be a very present help in the time of trouble
0VI57viMdps,295600,304880,God is not just with you on the  mountaintops he's with you in the valleys    when you're going through things  he knows what you're up against  
0VI57viMdps,304880,312560,the scripture says God is concerned about what  concerns you a sparrow doesn't fall to the ground  
0VI57viMdps,312560,319280,without God knowing about it how much more is  God concerned about what's happening in your life  
0VI57viMdps,319280,326240,trust him live from a place of peace this is  a decision we have to make on a daily basis  
0VI57viMdps,326800,332800,because every day there's something to worry about  there's some reason to get upset all through the  
0VI57viMdps,332800,340319,day keep this phrase close to your heart God's  got this he's concerned about me he's working in  
0VI57viMdps,340320,347360,my life he's bigger than my enemies he's lining up  the right people he's arranging things in my favor  
0VI57viMdps,347360,355759,that attitude of faith is what allows God  to do amazing things do you know why and how  
0VI57viMdps,357440,363440,the shepherd boy David was able to  prevail over the warrior giant Goliath  
0VI57viMdps,365120,375360,very simple David didn't compare himself  to the giant he compared the giant to God  
0VI57viMdps,377520,382879,we need to quit comparing ourselves to our  troubles quit comparing ourselves to our  
0VI57viMdps,382880,389040,pain and our pressure and the things we think we  can't do anything about their giants in our lives  
0VI57viMdps,389040,395120,and instead of trying to figure out what can I do  about it do I have enough money do I have enough  
0VI57viMdps,395120,400720,clout do I have enough friends is there any way  I can solve this and when you look at it through  
0VI57viMdps,400720,407360,that eye you're comparing David to Goliath but  David was smart enough to say you come to me with  
0VI57viMdps,407360,413840,sword and spear but I come to you in the name  of the Lord of hosts and the bible said David  
0VI57viMdps,413840,421840,ran right toward him and let the rock go and the  giant come down he compared the giant to his God
0VI57viMdps,424080,431280,what you're facing may be bigger stronger more  powerful but when you refuse to worry when you  
0VI57viMdps,431280,438240,refuse to live stressed out instead you stay in  peace thanking God that he's fighting your battles  
0VI57viMdps,438240,446160,knowing that he's in control you are showing God  by your actions that you're trusting him we worry  
0VI57viMdps,446160,454400,too much we worry about all sorts of things don't  we we worry about things we can't even change  
0VI57viMdps,456160,463840,we worry until we're a nervous wreck we  worry ourselves into high blood pressure  
0VI57viMdps,464960,471440,we worry ourselves into a stroke or a  heart attack we worry ourselves into ulcers  
0VI57viMdps,474480,487680,we worry until we become  absolutely miserable people    the kind of people nobody wants to be around  we worry when it would be easier to trust  
0VI57viMdps,487680,495360,God is something weighing you down today are  you worried about a situation frustrated by  
0VI57viMdps,495360,500800,what didn't work out or maybe down on yourself  because you're not where you thought you would be  
0VI57viMdps,501680,509039,God is saying to you I've got this it's  not a surprise to me I have new beginnings  
0VI57viMdps,509040,515120,I have healing I have breakthroughs I'm  asking you to change your perspective  
0VI57viMdps,515760,523520,switch over into faith that situation at work that  you're worried about God's got it I'm asking you  
0VI57viMdps,523520,529680,to quit worrying about what you're facing quit  losing sleep over that child that's not doing  
0VI57viMdps,529680,535920,right quit being upset because somebody did  you wrong your dream hasn't come to pass yet  
0VI57viMdps,535920,544880,can I tell you God's got this I like what Corey  Ten Boon the famous Jewish holocaust survivor  
0VI57viMdps,544880,551520,said she said worry does not empty tomorrow of  its troubles it empties today of its strength  
0VI57viMdps,552800,558080,your worry don't change tomorrow your worry  doesn't change next week your worry isn't going  
0VI57viMdps,558080,563440,to change your situation your worry isn't going to  help you make more money on the job it's not going  
0VI57viMdps,563440,568640,to fix your car it's not going to fix the house  it's not going to keep it from raining tomorrow  
0VI57viMdps,570480,575440,all the time you're worrying about whether or not  it'll rain tomorrow you're missing today's sun
0VI57viMdps,578640,584800,life is too short for you to live your life every  day worrying about something that might happen  
0VI57viMdps,586000,591040,worrying about what somebody has  said or what somebody has done  
0VI57viMdps,592160,599120,life is too short to spend it worrying  life is too short for you to allow yourself  
0VI57viMdps,599120,607200,to constantly all be all worked up about  something life is too short to go around miserable  
0VI57viMdps,608800,616080,life is too short for you to make everybody around  you miserable life is too short to harbor grudges  
0VI57viMdps,617680,623360,life is too short to hate quit worrying  about stuff that hadn't happened yet  
0VI57viMdps,625040,638480,it's a proven fact that 99 percent  of the things we worry about    never happen quit worrying about what can go  wrong and get excited about what can go right  
0VI57viMdps,638480,644800,it doesn't take any more effort to believe  something bad's going to happen than it does to  
0VI57viMdps,644800,652800,believe something good is going to happen no more  effort and by the way they're really both faith  
0VI57viMdps,654400,661199,you can either have faith that something  good is going to happen or you can have    faith something bad is going to happen either  one is you've got faith I choose to have faith  
0VI57viMdps,661200,666880,God's going to do something good I said I choose  to have faith God's going to do something good
0VI57viMdps,670960,683520,quit worrying about the future    as children of God we don't know what the  future holds but we know who holds the future  
0VI57viMdps,684880,697120,quit worrying about the future put it in the  hands of God that's where it belongs anyway    sometimes we're trying to play God we're trying to  make our boss promote us make ourselves get well  
0VI57viMdps,697120,705040,and make the contract go through but when you take  your hands off and say God I know you've got this  
0VI57viMdps,705760,711120,I'm not going to worry about my finances I'm not  going to live up tight because of the medical  
0VI57viMdps,711120,717600,report I'm not going to be frustrated because  I haven't met the right person God I trust your  
0VI57viMdps,717600,725759,timing and I trust your ways my life is in your  hands God never promised that we wouldn't have  
0VI57viMdps,725760,731760,difficulties but he did promise he would give  us strength for every battle he would take what  
0VI57viMdps,731760,739200,was meant for harm and use to our advantage you  may have a good reason to worry about something  
0VI57viMdps,739200,745920,in your health your finances a dream you've done  everything you can doesn't look like it's going to  
0VI57viMdps,745920,754079,work out stay in faith God is saying I've got  this I'm working behind the scenes I'm in the  
0VI57viMdps,754080,760880,process of turning it around it's just a matter  of time before you see things change in your favor  
0VI57viMdps,761600,768560,now live out of a place of peace a place of  trust it may not happen the way you thought  
0VI57viMdps,768560,776720,but God's ways are better than our ways God  knows what's best for you he's got this and  
0VI57viMdps,776720,783040,if you're in the middle of a storm right now  instead of going home tonight and worry yourself  
0VI57viMdps,783600,790240,sleepless go to work tomorrow feeling bad  because you worried all night and didn't sleep  
0VI57viMdps,791680,795200,you know what you realize in the  morning after you've worried all night  
0VI57viMdps,796880,799840,is that the problem's still  there worrying didn't fix it
0VI57viMdps,802400,814000,so I'm worried about my child  I'm worried about our money    I'm worried about jobs I'm worried about a car  I'm worried about a place to live I'm worried  
0VI57viMdps,814000,819120,about my spouse I'm worried you can worry  worry worry worry worry and you're not going  
0VI57viMdps,819120,826080,to change no kids no spouse no family no bank  balance because worrying how you fix this stuff  
0VI57viMdps,827440,832880,the way you get a miracle is lay the  worry aside and have faith in God
0VI57viMdps,835440,844800,don't worry God's got it all in control God  makes a way where there seems to be no way
0VI57viMdps,847040,853680,when you're stuck when you confuse when your  backs against the wall when your marriage is  
0VI57viMdps,853680,867600,struggling when your finances aren't doing well  when your children aren't doing well when you    have a health issue God makes a way where there  seems to be no way where there's no way to turn  
0VI57viMdps,867600,873519,there's nothing to do there's everything is lost  God makes a way where there seems to be no way  
0VI57viMdps,874240,882720,father God is the waymaker Isaiah 43 verse 16  the new living translation reads I am the Lord  
0VI57viMdps,882720,893279,who opened a way through the waters making a dry  path through the sea the red sea for his people  
0VI57viMdps,894480,903680,one more Isaiah 43 verse 1 message bible when  you're in over your head I'll be there with you  
0VI57viMdps,904800,909519,when you're in rough waters you will not go down  
0VI57viMdps,911120,918000,when you're between a rock and a  hard place it won't be a dead end  
0VI57viMdps,919440,926720,seems to me that there are a lot of people  finding themselves between a rock and a hard place  
0VI57viMdps,928320,937440,now these powerful verses state very clearly  that God can make a way that he is the waymaker  
0VI57viMdps,938800,949040,he is the path opener he is the trail blazer he  is the road builder he makes a way when there is  
0VI57viMdps,949600,961600,no way so there is no way there is no way but  but he makes one or there seems to be no way  
0VI57viMdps,963040,974800,and he reveals one that we couldn't see or haven't  seen he makes a way when it is impossible to us
0VI57viMdps,976880,983040,have you ever been between a rock and a  hard place ever feel like you can't make it
0VI57viMdps,985120,991200,ever ever feel like you you can't it's  impossible you you can't make it yeah  
0VI57viMdps,991200,995840,I've been there a few times ever  feel like you're in over your head  
0VI57viMdps,997440,1001600,I mean the situation's just too  deep you're you're treading water  
0VI57viMdps,1003920,1016480,throughout scripture one  principle is always constant    God can make a way when there seems to be no way  there are times when life hands us situations and  
0VI57viMdps,1016480,1024559,many are in them now with the atmosphere in  our world situations in which our faith must  
0VI57viMdps,1024560,1032560,rise and push us to keep right on going trusting  that God will make a way for us to pass through  
0VI57viMdps,1032560,1039680,the difficult times to pass through the the  trying time pass through the unknown places  
0VI57viMdps,1040720,1047919,to pass through the unknown destinations  times you can't when you can't see  
0VI57viMdps,1049440,1058480,like Abel sacrificial times like Noah like  Noah stormy times like Abraham times when  
0VI57viMdps,1058480,1067760,there's destinations before you that you can't you  can't know you can't see like Sarah baron times  
0VI57viMdps,1067760,1078960,like Elijah lonely times like Job painful times  homesick times testing times death bedtimes just  
0VI57viMdps,1078960,1088159,plain old times when it takes faith to handle what  we don't know or see or feel or hear or understand  
0VI57viMdps,1088160,1097360,times when we have to put our faith in the  waymaker if you will trust him you can find him  
0VI57viMdps,1097360,1104720,to be the waymaker just like everyone that I just  mentioned in the scripture it's been my experience  
0VI57viMdps,1105760,1114160,that God doesn't mind getting between a rock and  a hard place and creating ways for his people
0VI57viMdps,1117040,1128880,listen to me today when I tell you that  God can make a way where there is no way
0VI57viMdps,1131120,1137920,hold on when you are in one of those places  where you say there's no way out of this  
0VI57viMdps,1139280,1148320,there's no way through this there's nobody  that can help me with this that this is the one  
0VI57viMdps,1148320,1159279,that's going to destroy me this is the situation  that is the end of me that's when God steps up
0VI57viMdps,1162080,1168399,and says you can put your trust in me  because I can do anything the things  
0VI57viMdps,1168400,1174000,that we think are blocking us God  is going to use to bring us victory  
0VI57viMdps,1175040,1185200,when we feel lost and we can't find our way we're  going to find out that God will always make a way
0VI57viMdps,1187360,1196000,unseen hands are working you may not see it  but unseen hands are working unseen plans are  
0VI57viMdps,1196800,1203840,are forming and unfolding you may not see it  but that doesn't mean that it isn't happening  
0VI57viMdps,1204960,1211520,he's working behind the scenes to turn things for  your good to turn things around for your families  
0VI57viMdps,1212160,1218880,to turn things around for prodigals to  turn things around he's he's working  
0VI57viMdps,1218880,1224240,behind the scenes on ways to bless you  he's working behind the scenes on ways to  
0VI57viMdps,1224880,1235040,to provide for you to open paths of connection  for you he's leading others into your life  
0VI57viMdps,1235680,1241520,you don't even know about couldn't possibly  know about he's leading others into your  
0VI57viMdps,1241520,1248400,life that will become the answers to your heart  cry answers to your prayers he's blazing a path  
0VI57viMdps,1248400,1256880,beyond the dead ends he doesn't stop when it  looks like it's over never has he makes away  
0VI57viMdps,1258880,1266800,that's why Hebrews 11 teaches so emphatically  keep going keep trusting keep believing don't quit
0VI57viMdps,1269280,1276800,well for you as a dead end to him is an entryway  to a place you haven't seen yet to a place  
0VI57viMdps,1276800,1283920,of awesome victory his love will make a  way for you to get there he's the waymaker
0VI57viMdps,1286320,1294320,he has a plan that we haven't seen yet oh I'm  confident of that there's no dead end to him  
0VI57viMdps,1295520,1302160,and I came today to tell you he's the waymaker you  may not see it but he's the waymaker you may have  
0VI57viMdps,1302160,1310800,came in today or you may be watching today and you  say I cannot see this that's okay he's behind the  
0VI57viMdps,1310800,1319360,scene he's working and he's the waymaker he's  going to anoint you to see beyond the dead end  
0VI57viMdps,1320320,1326639,and he's going to anoint you to move into  an area you didn't even know anything about  
0VI57viMdps,1328640,1338000,god will make a way well there seems to  be no way and I want to add this to it    God will make a way where there seems to be no  way just don't forget him when you get there  
0VI57viMdps,1340000,1346560,when things feel hopeless they feel helpless you  just need to know that god promises to make a way  
0VI57viMdps,1348160,1350400,when you feel like every door has been shut
0VI57viMdps,1355520,1360640,you can't see how something is going to  happen in front of you he will make a way  
0VI57viMdps,1361520,1366640,because our God is a waymaker and he will make  a way through providing a miracle he'll make  
0VI57viMdps,1366640,1370800,a way through keeping a promise or he'll just  shine light into the darkness of your situation  
0VI57viMdps,1371680,1378960,God makes a way in the middle of no way Israel  found themselves at the red sea and God separates  
0VI57viMdps,1378960,1384960,the waters and in the midst of impossibility  Israel walks through on dry ground sea separated  
0VI57viMdps,1384960,1391440,on each side and they walk through that's a  God that makes a way in the middle of no way
0VI57viMdps,1393840,1402000,you know when we talk about God being a miracle  worker there are a lot of skeptics in the world    today even within the Christian community that  that would say that the miracles of the bible  
0VI57viMdps,1402000,1409360,just either never actually took place or they're  not for today but the question for all of us  
0VI57viMdps,1409360,1419520,is is really is he still working miracles that's  the question is he still the miracle worker today  
0VI57viMdps,1421200,1428960,is God still in the miracle business can can  blind eyes that have never seen miraculously  
0VI57viMdps,1428960,1434640,still be open can God still take just a small  amount of food and still multiply that food to  
0VI57viMdps,1434640,1442640,to feed thousands can people still be miraculously  healed when everything else says that there's just  
0VI57viMdps,1442640,1448480,no way does God still intervene into  human affairs in an extraordinary way  
0VI57viMdps,1449440,1459039,and based on what I read in scripture and what  I've seen with my own two eyes and what I've    experienced God I want to tell you that God is  still in the business of doing miracles I want  
0VI57viMdps,1459040,1463680,you to know that today I believe that with  all of my heart he is still a miracle worker  
0VI57viMdps,1464720,1473440,over the past few years I've watched God  heal relationships that seem beyond repair    I've watched him heal people of cancer when  doctors said it couldn't be done I've watched him  
0VI57viMdps,1474480,1479919,provide financially for people when all hope  seemed to be lost watch God provide for my  
0VI57viMdps,1479920,1485840,family when we said there's just no way  that this can happen I've watched him heal
0VI57viMdps,1488080,1494159,both of my boys from back injuries when the  doctors looked at both of them and said it's  
0VI57viMdps,1494160,1499840,never going to happen then I watched God do it  God is still in the business of doing miracles  
0VI57viMdps,1501360,1509920,I want you to know that I want you to believe it  because I believe it with everything inside of me    most of us I would say we have no problem  believing that God does miracles today  
0VI57viMdps,1511280,1519120,but we're not quite sure he'll do them for us  in order to experience a miracle  sometimes you have to take a step of faith
0VI57viMdps,1521280,1528880,miracles are God's business obedience is mine  miracles are God's business obedience is yours  
0VI57viMdps,1530240,1537919,I'm still the miracle worker but  you've got to take a step of faith    I like what Mark Batterson says he says you  can't expect God to do the supernatural if you  
0VI57viMdps,1537920,1544160,aren't willing to do the natural and here's  the point if you want to see the miraculous  
0VI57viMdps,1544160,1553600,sometimes you have to take a step of obedience you  have to trust God you have to have faith and you    have to ask you have to do what he's asking you  to do even if you don't want to even if everything  
0VI57viMdps,1553600,1561200,inside of you is screaming no that doesn't make  sense some of you are believing God for a desired  
0VI57viMdps,1561200,1569840,outcome but quite honestly what you are asking God  to do for you requires a miracle to get it done  
0VI57viMdps,1573200,1580000,you need a miracle and Jesus is the  miracle worker he is the miracle worker  
0VI57viMdps,1581680,1590799,nothing is impossible for Jesus to do for you    Luke chapter 1 verse 37 says for nothing will  be impossible with God Matthew chapter 19 verse  
0VI57viMdps,1590800,1596400,26 says but Jesus looked at them and said with  with man this is impossible let's say it together  
0VI57viMdps,1596400,1603760,but with God all things are possible I love  Ephesians 3 20 Paul writes now to him who is able  
0VI57viMdps,1604400,1610400,to do immeasurably more than all we ask or  imagine according to his power that is in work  
0VI57viMdps,1610400,1614320,with that doesn't work with inside of us what  does that mean it just means simply God is able  
0VI57viMdps,1615920,1622080,God is able Eugene Peterson says  most miracles are the byproduct of  
0VI57viMdps,1622080,1627360,a long obedience in the same direction for  some of you guys are saying to you get up  
0VI57viMdps,1628560,1633760,get up trust me move forward take  a step of obedience here's another  
0VI57viMdps,1633760,1639840,thing if Jesus does a miracle miracle in your  life there's always a bigger purpose involved
0VI57viMdps,1642080,1649360,what's the purpose it will always always  always be about bringing God glory and  
0VI57viMdps,1649360,1654559,drawing you closer to him to deepen  your faith to put Jesus on display  
0VI57viMdps,1655200,1662720,listen every one of the miracles in the book  of john every one of the miracles in the bible    is about bringing glory to God and deepening  the faith of the people involved in the miracle  
0VI57viMdps,1663920,1671280,but here's what you need to know God  will never waste your pain he will never    waste your hurt he will never waste your  suffering and he will never waste a miracle
0VI57viMdps,1673520,1678640,and here's the other thing regardless of  how long you've been waiting on a miracle  
0VI57viMdps,1678640,1684880,Jesus has not forgotten about you there  are no promises in God's word that says
0VI57viMdps,1687040,1695920,that God's going to heal every person that is  suffering or every person that's paralyzed or    every person that that's in pain while we're  here on this earth could he heal everyone in the  
0VI57viMdps,1695920,1701600,world right now that's suffering absolutely  but for whatever reason he chooses not to  
0VI57viMdps,1702880,1708640,even though Romans 8 23 says we groan to  be released from pain and suffering in this  
0VI57viMdps,1708640,1712800,lifetime it won't be until we get to heaven  that will be healed and be given new bodies  
0VI57viMdps,1714160,1719360,and listen that's a tough reality to accept about  God's sovereignty it's especially tough if if  
0VI57viMdps,1721040,1731200,maybe you're a child or you have a child that  is suffering or someone that you love deeply    and you just watch them suffer all day long  however even though I don't understand why God  
0VI57viMdps,1732000,1738480,may choose to do a miracle here but he chooses  not to do a miracle over here I do know this  
0VI57viMdps,1739760,1745360,he is compassionate he is loving he is  good and he's not forgotten about anyone  
0VI57viMdps,1746400,1758640,he is with you just as much as he's with  the person that he does the miracle for    just as much and listen some of you are waiting  on God to do a miracle in your life listen our  
0VI57viMdps,1758640,1766400,savior is still a miracle worker he is still  a promise keeper he's not forgotten about you
0VI57viMdps,1770320,1777120,Isaiah chapter 40 verse 28 says have you heard  have you never heard have you never understood  
0VI57viMdps,1777120,1785600,the Lord is the everlasting God the creator  of all the earth he never grows weak or weary    no one can measure the depths of his understanding  he gives power to the weak and strength to the  
0VI57viMdps,1785600,1791919,powerless even youths will become weak and tired  and young men will fall in exhaustion but those  
0VI57viMdps,1791920,1797200,who trust in the Lord who put their faith  in the miracle worker will find new strength  
0VI57viMdps,1797200,1808880,they will soar high in wings like eagles they  will run and not grow weary they will walk and    not faint that means that regardless of what  you have been through today Jesus is still  
0VI57viMdps,1808880,1815600,a miracle worker and the question for  you today is do you need a miracle
0VI57viMdps,1817760,1828080,God's timing is rarely our timing which is why  one of the most frequent cries in the Psalms is  
0VI57viMdps,1828880,1836880,how long how long why not now God what  possible reason could you have for making this  
0VI57viMdps,1837760,1851200,protracted suffering even longer  faith is at least in part the ability to  trust that if you knew everything God knew  
0VI57viMdps,1852160,1864000,and if you understood everything God understood  and if you could see everything God sees you'd say  
0VI57viMdps,1864000,1870720,that's right it takes faith to believe  that because our vision is so limited  
0VI57viMdps,1870720,1877840,and our pain can seem so long but if we knew  what God knew and could see what God sees  
0VI57viMdps,1878960,1884559,we would say of course of course I  see why that had to happen to him  
0VI57viMdps,1884560,1888240,and to them and to her into that country and  that people and that decision and that thing  
0VI57viMdps,1889840,1896559,God knew what he was doing I love what the  commentator Victor Hamilton says God's delays  
0VI57viMdps,1897200,1904799,are not necessarily God's denials and as some of  you endure what seems like a long period of God's  
0VI57viMdps,1904800,1912800,delay delay delay know that it is not necessarily  his denial when thoughts tell you it's too late  
0VI57viMdps,1913440,1924800,it's never going to happen now let  that go in one ear and out the other    God is faithful what he promised you is  still in round you may not see any sign of it  
0VI57viMdps,1925360,1932880,every circumstance says there's no way things are  happening that you can't see in the unseen realm  
0VI57viMdps,1932880,1939680,God is moving the wrong people out of the way  lining up the healing the favor the good breaks  
0VI57viMdps,1939680,1945600,they're already on your schedule but here's the  key if you could see how it was going to happen  
0VI57viMdps,1946160,1952000,that wouldn't take any faith god can use anything  and anybody to get you where he wants to take you  
0VI57viMdps,1952560,1958480,and so I just came to tell somebody who came in  here feeling for your sorry for yourself and came  
0VI57viMdps,1958480,1966400,in here just feeling woe is me never nothing  good ever happens to me I'm never I'm always  
0VI57viMdps,1966400,1972720,the last one higher than the first one fired I'm  always and you and you got your little sad song  
0VI57viMdps,1972720,1980480,that you've loved uh uh to sing I came to tell you  pick up the needle put on a new song I am who God  
0VI57viMdps,1980480,1987760,said I am time for you to quit disqualifying  yourself some of us disqualify ourselves for  
0VI57viMdps,1987760,1994400,we ever show up I serve a God who can give  me a job I'm not technically qualified for  
0VI57viMdps,1995280,2001760,but because I'm in his bloodline if he wills  me to work there he's going to put me there no  
0VI57viMdps,2001760,2008240,matter how he gets me there but sometimes your  plan and God's plan are two different things  
0VI57viMdps,2009520,2014560,oh I came to tell you you got don't worry about  your plan when yours falls apart that just means  
0VI57viMdps,2014560,2019600,it wasn't God that's all it means somebody needs  to take that with you when it doesn't work out  
0VI57viMdps,2019600,2024799,the way you thought it would work out that just  means that wasn't God's way that's all it means  
0VI57viMdps,2024800,2030320,don't get desperate don't get frustrated don't  certainly don't get mad at God he didn't give you  
0VI57viMdps,2030320,2036159,the plan you add the plan sometimes we give God  our deadlines and get mad when he doesn't meet him  
0VI57viMdps,2037600,2044160,oh but God does things in his own way his ways are  not our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts and  
0VI57viMdps,2044160,2050240,so you got to learn to walk by faith promises  that you've given up on dreams you've let go of  
0VI57viMdps,2050800,2056320,you've accepted it's too late to accomplish  that goal too late to break the addiction too  
0VI57viMdps,2056320,2063360,late to have a baby that may be true looking at  a normal schedule you don't see it on there but  
0VI57viMdps,2063360,2069520,God is saying it's still on my schedule I still  have a way to bring it to pass I wouldn't have  
0VI57viMdps,2069520,2075679,promised it if I wasn't going to do it now all  through the day father thank you that what you  
0VI57viMdps,2075679,2081839,started in my life you're going to finish it may  seem too late for me but I know it's not too late  
0VI57viMdps,2081840,2088480,for you thank you for these unscheduled blessings  blessings out of season I came to tell you your  
0VI57viMdps,2088480,2096000,timeline is in the hand of your God he knows what  he started in your life he knows where he's taking  
0VI57viMdps,2096000,2103520,you and you gotta walk by faith and not by sight  and stop getting mad at all the people around you  
0VI57viMdps,2103520,2110080,it's not their job to elevate your life God  is the one who will exalt you in good time  
0VI57viMdps,2110080,2118240,humble yourself unto the mighty hand of god in due  season when the time is right he will exalt you
0VI57viMdps,2121520,2130400,don't ever mistake your feeling of urgency don't  ever mistake your feeling of urgency for purpose  
0VI57viMdps,2130400,2136880,from God your urgency your sense of having  to do something should can deceive you into  
0VI57viMdps,2136880,2143599,thinking that your purpose from God I've got to  do this right now but here's the thing you feel  
0VI57viMdps,2143600,2151040,urgency and I feel urgency but God does not it  doesn't mean that your urgency is felt by God  
0VI57viMdps,2153040,2158880,God may put something urgent in your life but  here's the reality your urgency doesn't mean  
0VI57viMdps,2158880,2165359,that God also feels it when we handle things  ourselves and don't trust in God's timing  
0VI57viMdps,2165360,2172960,we always make things worse right isn't that what  we do we help things along we try to find a way  
0VI57viMdps,2174160,2183119,to get the ball rolling I you know I know  God spoke this but you know it seems like    God needs a little help so you know lean in and  get the ball rolling come up with some solutions  
0VI57viMdps,2184720,2192400,we don't understand how God could do something but  remember he's God he works in supernatural ways  
0VI57viMdps,2192400,2199359,often using natural systems but he  does things above creation is anything  
0VI57viMdps,2199360,2206640,too hard for the Lord is there anything too hard  for the lord just because it seems like God is too  
0VI57viMdps,2206640,2212799,late doesn't mean that he's not going to come  through don't be fooled by the circumstances  
0VI57viMdps,2213360,2219200,you may not see anything the odds are against  you the experts say it's not going to work out  
0VI57viMdps,2219760,2227280,God controls the universe don't be impatient  for him to act keep believing keep praying and  
0VI57viMdps,2227280,2232720,every blessing that belongs to you will  show up you won't have to go after it  
0VI57viMdps,2232720,2239359,it's going to come to you it's going to happen at  the time God has planned have you given up hope  
0VI57viMdps,2241040,2246560,have you given up hope did God speak something  to you and you look at it and say there is  
0VI57viMdps,2246560,2252720,no physical real way that this could happen  scientifically emotionally whatever there's no way  
0VI57viMdps,2252720,2258160,this could happen this word of God that was given  to me there's no way it could happen you're in the  
0VI57viMdps,2258160,2265760,perfect place for God to show up and speak into  your desolation the word that he has which is hope  
0VI57viMdps,2265760,2272320,that his word never returns void then  his purposes and his plans for you  
0VI57viMdps,2272320,2278400,will not be thwarted he is God  and when he speaks it it is so  
0VI57viMdps,2279440,2284960,just check out the first narrative of  scripture in the creation of all things  
0VI57viMdps,2284960,2294000,he spoke it when God speaks it comes to be but we  are limited by time and we look at it and we know  
0VI57viMdps,2294880,2302720,that time matters to us it matters we are looking  at time linearly I do not believe that God does  
0VI57viMdps,2303680,2312160,God looks in from eternity time is something God  created he's not subservient to it he uses it  
0VI57viMdps,2312160,2324000,he gave us all the numerology that's in the  bible the seven days being so significant    six days in a rest and the whole like rhythm  of the earth in its seasons God of course uses  
0VI57viMdps,2324000,2332640,time but God is not subservient to it god  is eternal he is the alpha and the omega the  
0VI57viMdps,2332640,2342640,beginning in the end he was he is and he will be  he is outside of time he is God so remind yourself  
0VI57viMdps,2343520,2350320,that when God speaks it will come to be but  it doesn't mean that it will happen tomorrow  
0VI57viMdps,2351440,2358319,God doesn't do things on a normal schedule  a normal time frame he has some unscheduled  
0VI57viMdps,2358320,2365280,blessings for you things that are out of season  out of the ordinary that shouldn't happen now the  
0VI57viMdps,2365280,2371840,medical report says it's too late the financial  experts say things should be down that's when God  
0VI57viMdps,2371840,2379600,steps in and says let me show you who I am I'm not  limited by time I'm not affected by the economy  
0VI57viMdps,2379600,2386800,I'm not restricted by your age your background  the opposition by how long it's been I control  
0VI57viMdps,2386800,2394720,the universe when I speak wombs come back to life  when I speak red seas part when I speak sicknesses  
0VI57viMdps,2394720,2402480,leave when I speak addictions are broken marriages  are restored opportunities show up remember  
0VI57viMdps,2403600,2414160,every calling every pull into something is a  journey of faith based on his timing not yours  
0VI57viMdps,2414720,2423280,we cannot engineer a life of faith hear that  church you cannot engineer a life of faithful  
0VI57viMdps,2423280,2430160,obedience you can only live into it trust  him when you don't see anything happening  
0VI57viMdps,2430720,2438240,believe when heaven is silent he's working behind  the scenes every blessing that has your name on it  
0VI57viMdps,2438240,2443920,if you will be patient it's not only going to find  you it's going to be much better than you think  
0VI57viMdps,2444720,2452800,friends know this your life is purposeful but  we have to wait on his perfect timing we may  
0VI57viMdps,2452800,2459680,not understand God's timing but we can trust  his character will we be courageously obedient  
0VI57viMdps,2459680,2465520,even when we have to wait and here's the  thing if you won't say yes to it you'll  
0VI57viMdps,2465520,2471360,never get to see the fulfillment of God you  will have to wait in courageous obedience  
0VI57viMdps,2471360,2478480,for the word of the Lord to come to pass he  works out his plans and purposes in us nothing  
0VI57viMdps,2479360,2486560,I want I want this to be the final words you  hear nothing is wasted when we trust in god's  
0VI57viMdps,2486560,2493840,timing he is the God who says I will give you  beauty for ashes I will give you the oil of joy  
0VI57viMdps,2494560,2502800,in your time of mourning and grief only God can  do that only God can redeem time spent waiting  
0VI57viMdps,2503840,2511760,time spent hopeless God is the God who invites us  to believe in his character above and beyond our  
0VI57viMdps,2511760,2521840,circumstances nothing is wasted when we wait on  our faithful God's timing to reach its fulfillment
0VI57viMdps,2524800,2530080,if the truth be told  and we were being totally honest
0VI57viMdps,2532800,2535840,most of us don't like waiting
0VI57viMdps,2538640,2543119,particularly if we're waiting for something  to change or something to get better
0VI57viMdps,2545360,2553120,waiting can be a very frustrating experience  but the worst kind of waiting of all
0VI57viMdps,2555600,2564320,is waiting on God  when God forces you to wait for  things to get better in your life
0VI57viMdps,2566560,2573680,for things to improve to change to  reverse and nothing is happening
0VI57viMdps,2575920,2584079,and yet over and over and over and over and  over again in the bible we're told to wait  
0VI57viMdps,2584080,2591840,on the Lord the most difficult place for  you to be in life is in God's waiting room  
0VI57viMdps,2593440,2601200,in God's waiting room some of you are in God's  waiting room right now what is God's waiting room  
0VI57viMdps,2601200,2608560,when you're in a hurry for something to  happen and God isn't that's God's waiting room  
0VI57viMdps,2609360,2615520,some of you are in a hurry to graduate  some of you are in a hurry to get married  
0VI57viMdps,2616800,2623520,some of you are in a hurry to start a family some  of you are in a hurry to launch a new business  
0VI57viMdps,2625120,2632640,to to close a big deal some of you in a hurry  for a big goal a big dream a big accomplishment  
0VI57viMdps,2632640,2640720,some of you are in a hurry for all kinds of  different things and God isn't we as human beings  
0VI57viMdps,2640720,2650480,hate to wait and we especially  struggle with waiting on God    have you ever been in a hurry when  God wasn't and your God I know you're  
0VI57viMdps,2650480,2658720,going to come through and I'm praying this  really Godly prayer I know it's your will    so where are you why aren't you coming  through and you're in the waiting room of life  
0VI57viMdps,2660720,2667680,and we get so impatient we want to hurry God up  and we want things right now and some of you have  
0VI57viMdps,2667680,2678960,been waiting for God to come through and you're  about to give up and you're getting discouraged    and you realize that God's standard time is  not always running on my time and it's in the  
0VI57viMdps,2678960,2684080,waiting rooms of life we learn to trust God the  most in those difficult waiting rooms of life  
0VI57viMdps,2684080,2689840,that's where God grows us and builds our character  the most through the pain of waiting we learn to  
0VI57viMdps,2689840,2695040,trust God and without faith it's impossible to  please God that's when he builds our character  
0VI57viMdps,2696240,2701520,you see while you're working on your project your  goal your dream your vision God's working on you  
0VI57viMdps,2702240,2710480,and God's much more interested in you  than in what you're trying to accomplish    because you're not taking your accomplishments  to heaven but you are taking your character  
0VI57viMdps,2711760,2722400,and sometimes God says yeah I intend to give you  what I've promised you I intend to answer that    prayer I intend to fulfill the vision but you're  not ready yet I want you to grow and when you're  
0VI57viMdps,2722400,2727920,ready then it's going to happen a lot of times we  think we're waiting on God for something to happen  
0VI57viMdps,2727920,2734880,like a prayer to be answered God says you're not  waiting on me I'm waiting on you I'm trying to  
0VI57viMdps,2734880,2740400,prepare you I'm testing your faith will you trust  me but I'm also trying to grow you up because the  
0VI57viMdps,2740400,2752079,blessing I want to give you so much bigger than  you can handle right now you're not ready for    it you can't handle it yet another thing you have  to learn in life is that a delay is not a denial  
0VI57viMdps,2752960,2761599,there's a big difference between no and not yet  now immature children don't know the difference  
0VI57viMdps,2761600,2766480,you tell a kid not yet they start crying and  having a hissy fit because they think it means no  
0VI57viMdps,2767280,2775040,they don't understand a delay is not a denial  God is saying I I intend to do these things in  
0VI57viMdps,2775040,2779680,your life that I've given you the vision the  dream to do but you're just not ready yet and  
0VI57viMdps,2780880,2788240,at the right time I will answer your prayer God's  often waiting on us now why is this important  
0VI57viMdps,2788240,2793440,because when you're in God's waiting room you  fall temptation to all kinds of negative emotions  
0VI57viMdps,2794160,2800160,you start worrying you start stressing out you get  anxious you get irritable you get spiritual add  
0VI57viMdps,2800160,2805760,you can get envious you can get jealous hey  he got a promotion I didn't get the promotion  
0VI57viMdps,2806880,2812240,that she's having a baby I'm not having a  baby she got engaged I didn't get engaged  
0VI57viMdps,2813440,2819359,he's starting a new business that's taken off  what about mine and all these kind of negative  
0VI57viMdps,2819360,2824640,emotions can come in to your life and then you get  frustrated and then you start having a pity party  
0VI57viMdps,2826240,2831840,so what does God want you to do when you're in the  waiting room of life and because you're going to  
0VI57viMdps,2831840,2837600,go through it many many times God is not a vending  machine where you put in the prayer and then you  
0VI57viMdps,2837600,2844480,pull the thing and you instantly get it there's  always a delay the delays are by design the delays  
0VI57viMdps,2844480,2850720,are by design to teach you to trust him and to  grow up in your character hey a delay is not a  
0VI57viMdps,2850720,2857520,denial there's a big difference between no and not  yet for those of your parents you understand this  
0VI57viMdps,2857520,2863120,there's a big difference between telling your  kids no and not yet it's just not time yet  
0VI57viMdps,2864400,2872079,and a delay is not a denial we see it all through  scriptures God told Noah to build a boat that  
0VI57viMdps,2872080,2881520,would save his family from a great flood but it  didn't rain for 120 years God told Abraham he'd    be the father of a great nation but he didn't  have his first child until he was 99 years old  
0VI57viMdps,2882320,2891519,God told Moses that he would lead the people  out of slavery from Egypt they'd been in for    over 450 years but then God sends Moses  out into the desert for 40 years to wait  
0VI57viMdps,2892960,2898800,God gives Joseph this great dream that he'll save  his family and his people from famine and he'll  
0VI57viMdps,2898800,2904560,be a great leader but then Joseph gets sold into  slavery he gets falsely accused and imprisoned  
0VI57viMdps,2904560,2910960,and he's waiting there in prison until finally God  takes him from prison and positions him second in  
0VI57viMdps,2910960,2919520,command in all of Egypt and the promise comes true  king David God had king David anointed as king  
0VI57viMdps,2919520,2926480,but he didn't really get to be king until years  later even Jesus Christ spent his first 30 years  
0VI57viMdps,2926480,2933680,waiting in a carpentry shop before he started  his earthly ministry see a delay is not a denial  
0VI57viMdps,2935600,2943680,when God delays sometimes we feel forgotten Psalm  13 1 says how long o Lord will you forget me  
0VI57viMdps,2943680,2950880,forever you come to a point sometimes of believing  that God has forgotten you don't worry it's a  
0VI57viMdps,2950880,2957119,common experience we all go through it one  time or another feeling that God isn't there  
0VI57viMdps,2957120,2963040,or at the very least he's forgotten us perhaps  our problems aren't important to him we imagine  
0VI57viMdps,2963040,2968640,the Psalmist encounters those very doubts in Psalm  chapter 10 and verse 1 here's what he says there  
0VI57viMdps,2969520,2978000,why do you stand afar off oh Lord why do you hide  in times of trouble what you believe is that he  
0VI57viMdps,2978000,2984720,has given up on you you may even be feeling that  way right now if so please allow me to remind you  
0VI57viMdps,2985360,2991680,that what you're contemplating is a simple  impossibility God never gives up on you  
0VI57viMdps,2992320,2998480,he never ceases to care about you and he will not  abandon his work on you of which your trial is a  
0VI57viMdps,2998480,3006880,part he even says that your name is written on the  Palms of his hands your very name is tattooed on  
0VI57viMdps,3006880,3013680,the Palms of God's hands it is engraved there  it cannot be removed and such is God's concern  
0VI57viMdps,3013680,3020079,for you he cannot forget you no matter what  storm you're weathering now you have never left  
0VI57viMdps,3020080,3029120,God's mind or his heart yes sometimes when God  delays we feel forgotten but God never delays  
0VI57viMdps,3029120,3035360,without a purpose he knows you he knows your  heart he knows everything you're asking him for  
0VI57viMdps,3036000,3042560,if he's not doing what you think he should do  just be patient because God loves you don't forget  
0VI57viMdps,3043360,3054640,he's got your name tattooed on  his Palm he knows who you are    he hasn't forgotten and he never will often God's  timing disappoints us you know there's something  
0VI57viMdps,3054640,3060240,maybe something you've been praying about for  a long time and you really you need an answer  
0VI57viMdps,3061120,3072320,you know maybe you've been um praying for  something really specific and you needed    God to show up within a particular time frame  you know it's an urgent need and he doesn't  
0VI57viMdps,3073600,3079920,when God doesn't answer when you need him  to I wonder what conclusions do you come to  
0VI57viMdps,3080960,3086640,do you think to yourself you know did I  do something wrong did I ask the wrong way  
0VI57viMdps,3087360,3093920,do you find yourself asking does God  even hear my prayers so often we think  
0VI57viMdps,3093920,3101760,when God doesn't answer in our way or in our time  that it's because he doesn't love us God loves you  
0VI57viMdps,3101760,3108720,he doesn't love anybody else one grain of  sand more than he loves you you know in those  
0VI57viMdps,3108720,3116720,darkest moments of life I want you to hear Jesus  looking right through your fear and saying to you  
0VI57viMdps,3116720,3124160,trust me I am right here God's timing might not  have been everything you hoped for in your life  
0VI57viMdps,3124160,3129359,but I hope you understand that you can  trust the one who keeps the time clock  
0VI57viMdps,3130560,3137840,we don't like to trust somebody else's  timing why because if we lose control  
0VI57viMdps,3139840,3149680,and so we'd rather then trust God because trusting  God means my goodness I actually have to trust God  
0VI57viMdps,3150240,3154560,we'd rather go listen I like the plan and purpose  you have for my life but can we do it my way
0VI57viMdps,3156640,3164880,and here's the funny thing now that I'm a parent  I recognize in my children that they don't like it  
0VI57viMdps,3164880,3172240,to wait on my timing they don't like to wait  they don't like to chill and be patient but the  
0VI57viMdps,3172240,3179840,thing is if they would just trust my timing  they would recognize it's for their good  
0VI57viMdps,3180560,3191200,it's for them to be blessed and prosperous and  so you can live life frustrated anxious stressed  
0VI57viMdps,3191200,3199200,out angry or you can rest and go God I have to  trust in your timing just trust his timing why  
0VI57viMdps,3199200,3204720,because it'll give you peace it'll give you rest  and it will help you to remove all disappointment  
0VI57viMdps,3204720,3214320,and hurt and bitterness from your heart because  you'll know actually God's in control of my    life why didn't god just tell you everything  that's gonna happen in your life right up front
0VI57viMdps,3216880,3222000,well I think there are two or three reasons first  it would overwhelm you probably scare you to death  
0VI57viMdps,3222000,3227200,but the real reason God doesn't announce his  timetable to you is he wants you to trust him  
0VI57viMdps,3228560,3239680,he says just live one day at a time trust me  I I'm a good God I'm a loving God everything    I do in your life is for love but you just got to  trust me in acts chapter 1 in the bible the bible  
0VI57viMdps,3239680,3248079,says this Jesus said in verse 7 you don't get to  know the time timing is the father's business so  
0VI57viMdps,3248080,3258880,you're just not ever going to know stuff in  advance you don't know what's going to happen    tomorrow in your life much less the rest of your  life God does not tell us the details in advance  
0VI57viMdps,3260320,3266080,he has a timetable for your life but he  doesn't tell you the details in advance  
0VI57viMdps,3266080,3274400,if you could understand why God does everything  God does you'd be God God's timing isn't good  
0VI57viMdps,3274400,3281200,it's perfect because he knows all the details  he knows past present future he knows what we  
0VI57viMdps,3281200,3289119,need what we want what's the wisest thing to do  you can never go wrong waiting upon God's timing  
0VI57viMdps,3290800,3296560,if I'm going to wait upon God I've got to trust  him because my waiting is saying I'm trusting  
0VI57viMdps,3296560,3303360,you God that your timing is better than mine you  know what I do not know your time is always right  
0VI57viMdps,3304000,3309840,and so I'm going to trust you and I'm going to  wait till you give me permission to go there or  
0VI57viMdps,3309840,3315600,do this I have that above the ella it isn't  that God's trying to deprive us of anything  
0VI57viMdps,3316240,3321920,he only wants what is best for us so it  takes faith and what I mean by that is  
0VI57viMdps,3321920,3327839,simply this am I willing to trust God  for his timing before I make a decision  
0VI57viMdps,3329840,3339280,just imagine how amazing life would be if we could  trust God all the time in every thing all the time  
0VI57viMdps,3340160,3347839,in every thing and trusting God means that we  stop trying to make things happen ourselves  
0VI57viMdps,3349520,3352400,and we wait on God how many love waiting
0VI57viMdps,3354880,3362160,we wait on God it's a painful word even to say it  and God doesn't do it when we'd like him to or the  
0VI57viMdps,3362160,3369839,way we'd like him to but I can promise you today  if you will keep your eyes on God and trust him  
0VI57viMdps,3369840,3377280,to be your recompense and to be your reward and to  be your vindicator you will get double blessings  
0VI57viMdps,3377280,3382240,for your farmer trouble trusting him doesn't  mean I'm going to get what I want when I want it  
0VI57viMdps,3382800,3389840,trusting him says I believe that when the timing  is right God will provide what I'm asking him for  
0VI57viMdps,3391040,3399040,you know broken hearts do mend bodies do healed  disappointment turns into new dreams and the end  
0VI57viMdps,3399040,3404240,of one thing can open the door for something  new if we will just put our trust in God  
0VI57viMdps,3404800,3415920,you know what if you're still here on  the planet God's got a plan for you    it seems to you like God's forgotten all about  you well he hasn't he hears you and he sees you  
0VI57viMdps,3416480,3421680,can I tell you today that you're not invisible God  knows exactly where you're at and he knows exactly  
0VI57viMdps,3421680,3432880,what's going on in your life and he knows exactly  how much you can take and how much you can't take    and he may not be early but he won't be late  God's timing is always perfect do I believe  
0VI57viMdps,3433600,3438080,that he has our best interest at heart  if I believe that I'm going to wait  
0VI57viMdps,3439120,3448960,but watch this somebody says I don't have any time  to waste you never waste time waiting on God never  
0VI57viMdps,3450160,3454480,you always find out that his  timing is always the right time
0VI57viMdps,3458320,3466880,sometimes you need to get knocked down before you    can really figure out what your what your  fight is and how you need to fight it
0VI57viMdps,3469280,3478320,sometimes you need to feel  the pain and sting of defeat    to activate the real passion and purpose  that God predestined inside of you
0VI57viMdps,3482080,3489360,God says in Jeremiah I know the plans  I have for you plans to prosper you  
0VI57viMdps,3490080,3498240,and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a  future hear me well on this day this day when you  
0VI57viMdps,3498240,3506480,have reached the hilltop and you are deciding on  on next jobs next steps careers further education  
0VI57viMdps,3507520,3517600,you would rather find purpose than a job or  career purpose crosses disciplines purpose is an  
0VI57viMdps,3517600,3523280,essential element of you it is the reason you are  on the planet at this particular time in history  
0VI57viMdps,3523840,3529440,your very existence is wrapped up in the things  you are here to fulfill whatever you choose for  
0VI57viMdps,3529440,3535920,a career path remember the struggles along the  way are only meant to shape you for your purpose
0VI57viMdps,3538560,3544160,when God has something for you it doesn't matter  who stands against it if it's meant for you
0VI57viMdps,3547440,3555040,God will move someone is holding you back away  from a door and put someone there who will open  
0VI57viMdps,3555040,3563520,it for you I don't know what your future is  but if you're willing to take the harder way  
0VI57viMdps,3564640,3570640,the more complicated one the one with more  failures at first their successes the one that  
0VI57viMdps,3570640,3577440,has ultimately proven to have more meaning more  victory more glory then you will not regret it  
0VI57viMdps,3578480,3592322,press on with pride and press on with purpose  and appreciate what God has brought you through
