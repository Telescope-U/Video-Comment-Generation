lm4J1TatFyE,744560,750720,okay  iran day two still coping with my recent
lm4J1TatFyE,750720,756480,fiery hair loss and looking to find  comfort in food hey where are we right  now we are in a sohan factory that which
lm4J1TatFyE,756480,762560,makes iranian desserts hedye a student  studying dentistry and a fan of the show  has offered to show me around today do
lm4J1TatFyE,762560,769279,you feel some conflict being here this  is like the enemy that's created to hurt  teeth yes of course but i'm okay you can
lm4J1TatFyE,769279,775839,brush your teeth afterwards oh all right  well that problem was solved pretty  quick how do you say the name of this  fruit again it's sohan
lm4J1TatFyE,775839,782560,sohan is a unique traditional persian  sweet it's buttery brittle studded with  pistachios and flavored heavily with
lm4J1TatFyE,782560,788800,saffron it smells amazing in here what  am i smelling mostly because of saffron  if you use saffron in a lot of our foods
lm4J1TatFyE,788800,795680,the making of sohan is beautiful it  starts with egg yolks flour saffron  sugar and vegetable oil all mixed by
lm4J1TatFyE,795680,802560,machine this vessel is just mixing but  here it's heated up it's going to kind  of slowly cook a bit enough to get thick
lm4J1TatFyE,802560,809200,after mixing in a heated vessel for 20  minutes it starts to become thick now  the real action
lm4J1TatFyE,809200,814560,it looks like the purpose overall is  they let it cool down a little bit but  then they like shatter it no they're not
lm4J1TatFyE,814560,820959,shattering it they're just smashing it  and then he pours statues and almonds on  top and then here he's gonna cut it into
lm4J1TatFyE,820959,824600,little squares basically
lm4J1TatFyE,826410,833440,[Music]

lm4J1TatFyE,853279,859199,tea good point do you have any tea on  you no unfortunately  the more i eat it the more i want to eat
lm4J1TatFyE,859199,866240,it it's very delicious the texture is  very crumbly and the pistachios it  doesn't have a strong flavor but it all  just adds to this general confectionary

lm4J1TatFyE,1282080,1288240,just immigrating to tehran from  different other kinds of provinces they  bring their own traditional foods to

lm4J1TatFyE,1356320,1362400,consisting of boiled wheat and one  ingredient i didn't expect to be eating  for breakfast lamb meat
lm4J1TatFyE,1362400,1367679,oh  oh  okay
lm4J1TatFyE,1367720,1373520,[Music]  to begin wheat grains are washed and
lm4J1TatFyE,1373520,1379039,boiled for five hours and the lamb is  boiled for two to three hours it's like  tender cooked meat that's been already
lm4J1TatFyE,1379039,1386240,kind of cooked sous-vide style in a  plastic bag and then i think they're  gonna grind it up now  yeah stand back the meat is grinding
lm4J1TatFyE,1386240,1391759,inside oh and then he puts in some of  the broth here it's like a wheat broth
lm4J1TatFyE,1393360,1399120,incoming it looked like some roasted  lamb and it's completely changed texture  it's kind of become a bit mushy almost
lm4J1TatFyE,1399120,1404320,next the wheat gravy is moved to a  powerful industrial strainer oh oh man
lm4J1TatFyE,1404320,1410240,he's straining out all the flavors all  the essence from the wheat without  actually using the wheat husk putting in
lm4J1TatFyE,1410240,1417600,some salt right now and he's going to  sea reach  the lamb meat is pounded into the wheat  until it all becomes one thick congealed
lm4J1TatFyE,1417600,1425200,consistency nice slapping i want to give  it a slap it smells amazing in here  for each two kilograms of meat we are

lm4J1TatFyE,1454240,1459600,maybe sound like a lamb right now that's  really good it's like a little bit of  lamb infused into this strong wheat
lm4J1TatFyE,1459600,1467880,flavor  it's salty it's weedy it's a little bit  lamby and that's it super simple

lm4J1TatFyE,1573039,1579919,the herb store this is what gives ash  its signature green color oh  everything turns kind of dark forest
lm4J1TatFyE,1579919,1585039,green add in chickpeas kidney beans  black pepper and salt in a separate pan
lm4J1TatFyE,1585039,1592159,he adds turmeric powder oil and fried  onion stirs it until it turns brown then  adds it back to the main vessel finally
lm4J1TatFyE,1592159,1597420,he adds the salty wheat noodles and  leaves it to boil for a few more minutes

lm4J1TatFyE,1626799,1631919,ingredients in it the cinnamon and sugar  they're best friends they work so well  together just one alone wouldn't have
lm4J1TatFyE,1631919,1637039,been nearly as good man that's a great  combination it depends on your own taste  there are a lot of people that they want
lm4J1TatFyE,1637039,1643919,to add a lot of kind of things you can  also put any of this in there but i kind  of like what they did already it has a  very familiar breakfast flavor to me
lm4J1TatFyE,1643919,1649200,except then i'm like oh wait there's  lamb meat also  ash us
lm4J1TatFyE,1649200,1655120,how do you wait there's a longer name  i've been using the nickname this whole  time mr archer
lm4J1TatFyE,1655120,1661039,yes  this is the ash base but what really  elevates the dish are the toppings
lm4J1TatFyE,1661039,1667679,kosh a commonly used sour yogurt  caramelized onion and fried mint this is  like slippery it doesn't want to stay on
lm4J1TatFyE,1667679,1672880,my spoon are you ready yeah let's try it  out  mmm oh that's very nice we tried the
lm4J1TatFyE,1672880,1679200,herbs earlier there's a bit much it was  intense but here when that flavor's  properly dispersed throughout the dish  that's really nice very salty very
lm4J1TatFyE,1679200,1685120,savory and the noodle is very soft  almost no texture it's a tremendous  flavor very fresh but like super heavy
lm4J1TatFyE,1685120,1690640,at the same time yes  i've only been here about a day and i'm  very blown away by this place and by the
lm4J1TatFyE,1690640,1696799,people the hospitality the kindness i  see on the street and just openness of  people it's certainly a place like no
lm4J1TatFyE,1696799,1703600,other there's something special about  eating food that local people consider  ordinary in such an extraordinary place
lm4J1TatFyE,1703600,1709679,ash haleem it's simple food but it's  inseparable from the culture and cuisine

lm4J1TatFyE,1763840,1770159,neon farsi words and characters light up  storefronts but at this point i can't  tell the difference between a lamp store
lm4J1TatFyE,1770159,1775679,and a sandwich shop luckily i'm being  joined by tehran's food reviewing power  couple
lm4J1TatFyE,1775679,1782000,considering there's no facebook or  youtube here instagram is the platform  of choice for foodies and gaza lay has

lm4J1TatFyE,1820159,1826559,almost 70 years 70 years  azari traditional tea house the kind of  place where friends and family gather
lm4J1TatFyE,1826559,1831600,for a smoke some tea or this and you  won't find anything like it outside of
lm4J1TatFyE,1831600,1838720,iran the first time you came here what  did you like so much about the  experience the dizzy dizzy is the best  food in iran really yes if i don't like
lm4J1TatFyE,1838720,1843760,this then i'm just not gonna like  personally you're gonna love it but i'm  gonna love it so no problem yes
lm4J1TatFyE,1843760,1850480,dizzy or abused literally means meat  juice the word also refers to the  traditional stoneware crocs it served it
lm4J1TatFyE,1850480,1857679,i am in the kitchen right now with ali  my brother thank you so much for having  us today and they're gonna start by  putting all these clay pots into this
lm4J1TatFyE,1857679,1864480,cooking device that i've never seen  before it's like a giant chest oven  these huge custom-made ovens are meant
lm4J1TatFyE,1864480,1870960,only for cooking this dish day in and  day out 100 at a time it's a super  simple recipe it's got about six
lm4J1TatFyE,1870960,1876559,ingredients starting here with chickpeas  and white beans these are like a little  bean shot glass to measure exact
lm4J1TatFyE,1876559,1882559,portions  next add the main ingredient lamb meat  it's not just the meat but a nice big
lm4J1TatFyE,1882559,1889039,hunk of fat to add even more flavor  unlike the beans he's being very  critical now making sure it's perfect no
lm4J1TatFyE,1889039,1894159,lamb hair so far so good the chef fills  each clay pot with water and they cook
lm4J1TatFyE,1894159,1900000,for six hours he's gonna be adding in  more water so it doesn't dry up but  otherwise this takes a super long time
lm4J1TatFyE,1900000,1906000,to cook but i think it's gonna be worth  it after six hours add some potato and  leave it be a separate pot is filled
lm4J1TatFyE,1906000,1912960,with tomato sauce turmeric lemon powder  chili powder and salt boiled and stirred  until it becomes thick then added to the
lm4J1TatFyE,1912960,1917278,dish giving the dizzy its true essence
lm4J1TatFyE,1918080,1923200,okay so what's that oh wow okay so we  have some bread sundeck
lm4J1TatFyE,1923360,1928399,sengak means little stone and this the  national bread of urad is cooked on top
lm4J1TatFyE,1928399,1934000,of thousands of hot stones that give  this bread its unique dimpled texture
lm4J1TatFyE,1934000,1940240,the dough is made with wheat and often  topped with dry herbs or spices in this  bakery they're using poppy seeds this is
lm4J1TatFyE,1940240,1946480,a square shape but the way he dumps it  on the stone is what gives it its unique  long shape he just kind of drapes it
lm4J1TatFyE,1946480,1953120,over the stones in such a way that it  stretches out i don't know how he does  it like look at all these they're all  pretty uniformly the same shape and
lm4J1TatFyE,1953120,1959679,probably my favorite part is that  there's still some stones locked into  the bread here you can see another one
lm4J1TatFyE,1959679,1964880,what was i thinking of course it's  really odd  does that make you nervous at all like a  million people are going to watch this
lm4J1TatFyE,1964880,1973000,video no no because i do this video  youtube my husband yes you should see

lm4J1TatFyE,2400160,2406400,a lot of over spicing but something like  the herb rice is so fresh and then when  you mix that with the fatty sheet neck

lm4J1TatFyE,2686160,2693359,the keys to persian cooking is  understanding that some foods are  considered to have a hot nature and  others a cold nature every food in iran
lm4J1TatFyE,2693359,2699920,is either hot or cold  no we balance them in their food for  example cucumber if you eat many

lm4J1TatFyE,2705119,2711280,of any cucumber  the food you should eat is also dictated  by whether or not your own nature is hot
lm4J1TatFyE,2711280,2717280,or cold what is your nature hot or cold  i'm the balanced one not hot not cold  the doctor said me you can eat

lm4J1TatFyE,3829359,3835599,argue whether or not it's deserved but  the result for everyday people is  skyrocketing prices on everyday goods
lm4J1TatFyE,3835599,3844480,like meat people decrease the amount of  that portion in their daily meal it used  to be around 10 square where like 15 now
lm4J1TatFyE,3844480,3851039,it's  35 more than double yeah more than  double  in iran kebabs are the preferred method

lm4J1TatFyE,3930319,3935839,and then you cook the rest of bacteria a  little bit of bacteria  i think it's all about mixing the
lm4J1TatFyE,3935839,3941039,ingredients bringing everything together  early on i was just like bread meat but  there's so much more elevation and
lm4J1TatFyE,3941039,3947240,flavor when you add some herbs and  yogurt vegetable put it all together  that's perfect

lm4J1TatFyE,3999920,4006720,wow that's nuts next adding a bucket of  glucose from here they let the machine  do the work for the next two hours but

lm4J1TatFyE,4024720,4031760,that's awesome after 30 minutes they add  in a foamy egg white mixture giving the  gas a more cloudy texture we need that
lm4J1TatFyE,4031760,4037440,cloudy nougaty stickiness but what  really makes gas special is these nuts  can you tell me about these nuts they're
lm4J1TatFyE,4037440,4042720,gonna use raw pistachios  that's all
lm4J1TatFyE,4043520,4050799,the making of this local treat has come  a long way since it began 450 years ago  but still some steps must be done by
lm4J1TatFyE,4050799,4057280,hand you're looking for hard parts of  the pistachio to remove it you have to  remove it
lm4J1TatFyE,4057280,4062559,i was wondering could i ask you in the  usual shift how many pistachios are you  actually eating because i would eat so
lm4J1TatFyE,4062559,4070280,many  just one and two why did she look up at  him while she said that
lm4J1TatFyE,4074920,4081039,[Music]  after six hours of rotating mixing the  whole mixture has just become a pure
lm4J1TatFyE,4081039,4087599,white you just have to go in there be  careful because of the blade and pick it  up round it a little bit and put it here
lm4J1TatFyE,4087599,4093680,it's nearly solid but then it slowly  starts to kind of ooze down
lm4J1TatFyE,4100480,4107120,do i get a spoon or do i use my hands we  can dip it with our hand it's fine yeah  it's fine
lm4J1TatFyE,4107278,4113920,really it's your fingers if you want to  your finger  okay i'm  it's warm okay it's not that bad it's

lm4J1TatFyE,4119600,4125920,in just a little bit but warm kind of  thick sugary marshmallowy feel to it  with tons of like so many pistachios in
lm4J1TatFyE,4125920,4131318,there what percentage like 37 percent 38  38 okay that's pretty close
lm4J1TatFyE,4131318,4138318,[Music]  it is like a warm sugary cloud wrapped  around pistachios the combination of the
lm4J1TatFyE,4138318,4144318,texture is like kind of crunchy with  this cloud around it and it's a little  bit sweet not too much considering how
lm4J1TatFyE,4144318,4150640,much sugar is in there yeah not super  sweet because of the syrup they use and  rose water kind of perfumey aromatic
lm4J1TatFyE,4150640,4157679,essence of the rose coming through too  this is delicious yeah  [Music]

lm4J1TatFyE,6888639,6894800,combinations i'm tempted to call it  spaghetti ice cream but it's not that  because the noodles aren't ice cream  they're actually they're real noodles
lm4J1TatFyE,6894800,6900400,right yeah it's kind of a noodle but we  call it holiday farsi
lm4J1TatFyE,6900400,6907280,in iran you're more likely to eat  noodles for dessert than for dinner  golet rose shop has been around for 65
lm4J1TatFyE,6907280,6913119,years refining this traditional iranian  recipe  thin vermicelli size noodles made from

lm4J1TatFyE,6930639,6936239,i would just eat this when i miss her  aside from that this texture is great  because the only one i have to compare
lm4J1TatFyE,6936239,6943040,it to is it in india this is basically a  noodle ice cream  oh that is a complex flavor profile
lm4J1TatFyE,6943040,6949599,those noodles are very soft and these  noodles have great texture they're like  frozen all the way through it's like  kind of fun to bite through don't
lm4J1TatFyE,6949599,6955840,compare it with any other place in the  world okay stop comparing it only in  iran there's a tradition when we finish
lm4J1TatFyE,6955840,6962320,the noodles we do something like this  and we drink the water it's like the
lm4J1TatFyE,6962320,6969679,broth i mean for me where i come from in  asia  we just call that broth
lm4J1TatFyE,6972000,6977440,super sugary sweet syrupy but it's  refreshing this is like a big dessert  i'm really surprised by the sizes of

lm4J1TatFyE,6984239,6990960,our old friend parnyan joins me as this  exotic food feast continues in her home  city of isfahan behind us a
lm4J1TatFyE,6990960,6997440,confectionary whipping up one of iran's  most outrageous desserts with an  ingredient you would never expect to see
lm4J1TatFyE,6997440,7004080,meat  yes does it seem normal to you i grow up  with that food what is the name in farsi
lm4J1TatFyE,7004080,7009199,which means yoghurt  must and isfahan tradition the main
lm4J1TatFyE,7009199,7016239,ingredients stewed meat and yogurt an  impossible combination but after seeing  how it's made it'll all make sense first
lm4J1TatFyE,7016239,7021679,of all thank you for the hair nut do you  need a little hair net like uh for your  mustache or that  no
lm4J1TatFyE,7021679,7027199,no  okay all right hey if you say something  lamb neck meat is braised until tender
lm4J1TatFyE,7027199,7032960,shredded into thin strips and mixed with  creamy iranian yogurt it's almost like  he's shampooing someone's hair that's
lm4J1TatFyE,7032960,7037360,what it reminds me of have you ever  shampooed someone's hair before
lm4J1TatFyE,7039120,7044560,[Music]  it's a very thorough mixing by the time  it's all mixed in do you even feel the
lm4J1TatFyE,7044560,7050880,meat in there no no no one can feel the  chances okay he's showing us the old  traditional way of doing it by hand but
lm4J1TatFyE,7050880,7058920,usually i mean he's using these machines  back here guys i mean yeah he's got  it's right here it's pretty useful
lm4J1TatFyE,7059650,7064880,[Music]  he blends saffron with sugar to make a  powder
lm4J1TatFyE,7064880,7070960,dilute that in water shakes it and  tosses it in with the rest  [Music]
lm4J1TatFyE,7070960,7077599,when the mixture turns a live strong  shade of vibrant yellow he adds more  sugar then more sugar and a lot more
lm4J1TatFyE,7077599,7084280,sugar mix mix mix and finally a  finishing touch some walnuts
lm4J1TatFyE,7085990,7091119,[Music]  it seems like the recipe it's just more
lm4J1TatFyE,7091119,7097679,saffron is never bad have you ever had  too much saffron ah i'm gonna have right  now are you saying this is too much i'm
lm4J1TatFyE,7097679,7103119,not even sure exactly what saffron  tastes like it seems like everything in  iran that's yellow like this is either
lm4J1TatFyE,7103119,7110000,turmeric saffron or sometimes both yeah  how does that taste for you oh that's
lm4J1TatFyE,7110000,7116159,what saffron tastes like saffron tastes  like elegance exactly you're right  there's no meat bits in there but it's a
lm4J1TatFyE,7116159,7122159,little weird how it's like sweet sour  and meaty at the same time  the end result tastes nothing like lamb
lm4J1TatFyE,7122159,7129119,meat but just like haleem where they mix  stewed mutton with wheat the meat itself  alters the texture of the dish giving it
lm4J1TatFyE,7129119,7134159,a congealed thick consistency unlike any  dessert i've tried before for me this is
lm4J1TatFyE,7134159,7143800,the pinnacle of luxury this is pure  opulence pure opulence i'm gonna add  that to my vocabulary great perfect
lm4J1TatFyE,7148960,7155520,in pursuit of chasing down the world's  most unique foods i've discovered that  if culinary traditions have survived for
lm4J1TatFyE,7155520,7161840,hundreds of years there's usually a  reason for it and more often than not  you'll be very happy you gave that wild
lm4J1TatFyE,7161840,7170560,looking dish a try  [Music]
lm4J1TatFyE,7170560,7178320,over the last two weeks i've explored  tehran and the most unique diverse  sections of central iran
lm4J1TatFyE,7179360,7185679,today before leaving the country i want  to partake in something that seemed  unthinkable just weeks ago thank you so
lm4J1TatFyE,7185679,7191599,much for having me eating a home-cooked  meal with a family in iran's capital  before coming i called a family member
lm4J1TatFyE,7191599,7197080,and i said hey i'm feeling a little bit  nervous about going to iran
lm4J1TatFyE,7198000,7204480,from the beginning of my journey until  now any notion i had of this place has  been erased and rewritten don't give a
lm4J1TatFyE,7204480,7210920,thumbs up it's considered offensive in  iran this is true it's offensive
lm4J1TatFyE,7214560,7221280,and now as my journey draws to an end  i'll experience a final dose of iranian  hospitality and i just can eat the whole
lm4J1TatFyE,7221280,7227599,thing yes including iran's most famous  home-cooked dish every week one time we  make it something you must try before
lm4J1TatFyE,7227599,7234360,leaving the country this is what i've  been kind of building up to this whole  trip up to this food
lm4J1TatFyE,7241760,7247760,ladies thank you for joining me today  thank you for having us do you know  anything about this food
lm4J1TatFyE,7247760,7255280,doing a little detective work i see  beans i see french fries i see a  meatball not a meatball is that a  meatball lemon a dried lemon we use it
lm4J1TatFyE,7255280,7261599,for seasoning oh  yes really yes that really threw me off  don't try that
lm4J1TatFyE,7261599,7267440,i was about to be like oh i can't wait  for this meatball  gaming is a traditional food love
lm4J1TatFyE,7267440,7272800,throughout the country a combination of  split peas tomatoes onion mutton dried
lm4J1TatFyE,7272800,7279679,limes and some french fries on top  served with persian steamed rice and a  bit of golden saffron soaked rice is
lm4J1TatFyE,7279679,7286800,this a normal lunch yes in iran this is  a very famous traditional food maybe  every week one day we have tai mei oh
lm4J1TatFyE,7286800,7292960,okay so pretty traditional  over the last two weeks i've immersed  myself in iranian culinary tradition and
lm4J1TatFyE,7292960,7299440,here's what i've learned though they use  a variety of spices the food generally  tastes very mild with a focus on letting
lm4J1TatFyE,7299440,7307119,natural flavors come through  whenever possible the meal is built  around meat especially mutton chicken or
lm4J1TatFyE,7307119,7313040,beef it can get heavy with generous  amounts of animal fat piled on top
lm4J1TatFyE,7313040,7318239,portions in restaurants are huge dairy  seems to accompany almost every meal in
lm4J1TatFyE,7318239,7323280,drinks as ingredients or as a side  yogurt is everywhere then there's the
lm4J1TatFyE,7323280,7329520,fresh bread and obsession in this  country  last sourness from sour fruit to sour
lm4J1TatFyE,7329520,7336000,milk sour flavors really stand out and  can be enhanced further with fresh or  dried limes
lm4J1TatFyE,7336000,7342080,where do we start hear this too on your  rice put it on the rice i knew it a  little bit of bean a little bit of oil a
lm4J1TatFyE,7342080,7349599,little bit of meat i'm gonna try just a  rice and bean  [Music]
lm4J1TatFyE,7349599,7356880,it's good it's very rich nice and medium  a little oily not a lot of salt i'm  gonna just i'm gonna hammer it with some  salt i found that food here does not
lm4J1TatFyE,7356880,7362719,have a ton of salt i like a bit of salt  i'm weird like that try with this one  together this is some kind of seasoned
lm4J1TatFyE,7362719,7368900,olives with a paste of pomegranate and  walnuts i'm going to take this i'm  putting it here
lm4J1TatFyE,7368900,7375199,[Music]  that is the key you've unlocked the  flavor i like it because it adds some
lm4J1TatFyE,7375199,7381199,sourness it's a little bit of sweetness  too i think without that it would feel  incomplete yes can you tell me a little
lm4J1TatFyE,7381199,7388000,bit more what you do in iran i'm a  student mostly hi sunny i've been  actually watching your video for a while

lm4J1TatFyE,7417119,7423440,negative about it it's true i told  anyone who asked that i am indeed  american and
lm4J1TatFyE,7423440,7430639,no one cared in fact most local people  responded positively and seem to be fans  of u.s culture we love
lm4J1TatFyE,7430639,7437840,yes from everywhere it doesn't matter  from which country we are welcome for  all of them really hospitality is simply
lm4J1TatFyE,7437840,7444159,built into iran's culture  they have a saying  guests are a gift from god a trip that
lm4J1TatFyE,7444159,7450560,began with anxiety and uncertainty is  ending with feelings of acceptance and  connection i want to ask a question
lm4J1TatFyE,7450560,7456159,because before i came here you know it  was kind of hard to do research so i  want to read off some advice i found  online and you can tell me if this stuff

lm4J1TatFyE,7475840,7481440,people here did that in the past it was  kind of used as an insult but today some  people find it offensive but like i
lm4J1TatFyE,7481440,7489599,think that people are more used to it oh  man i gave a lot of people the thumbs up  during this trip  are you keeping it real

lm4J1TatFyE,7706079,7712800,because it's very important for women in  iran this is part of our culture what  about men what's going on they don't do

lm4J1TatFyE,7718800,7725520,girlfriend for me  it's kind of an emergency i don't know  for me personally look every place is  different some places women cook the men
lm4J1TatFyE,7725520,7731280,cook some places both i think everybody  should have that one food at least that  they're really good at for me it's

lm4J1TatFyE,7781760,7788400,you can take off this is tadiq the brown  crispy bits of rice from the bottom of  the rice cooker and perhaps the most
lm4J1TatFyE,7788400,7794000,prized food in all of iran i heard  there's this thing called um taro can  you explain what that is it's like
lm4J1TatFyE,7794000,7801440,employee offer but do you mean it  sometimes people don't mean it but like  they just say it's like exaggerated oh

lm4J1TatFyE,7858639,7865360,of the best things i've tried so far  this trip really yeah  this is what i've been kind of building  up to this whole trip up to this food
lm4J1TatFyE,7865360,7872239,now strategy wise i've got the tadi  right here so i'm going to scoop this on  here oh there's meatballs in here too
lm4J1TatFyE,7872239,7878239,putting on the gourmet sabsi i mean do  you eat it like a salad or you just we  eat it like after we take a bite vietnam

lm4J1TatFyE,7896239,7902880,walnut oil i'm just saying george bush  invaded iraq over less oil than this  two weeks ago i was very uncertain of
lm4J1TatFyE,7902880,7908159,whether this trip would happen we got  our visas at the last minute and here we  are before coming a lot of the people i
lm4J1TatFyE,7908159,7913679,talked to i called a family member and i  said hey i'm feeling a little bit  nervous about going to iran
lm4J1TatFyE,7913679,7919199,are you wrong  promise me you won't go you can't do it  why have you been watching the news
lm4J1TatFyE,7919199,7925040,things politically are so intense right  now and i think that's all people ever  hear about iran is what's in the news
lm4J1TatFyE,7925040,7931599,and they don't see anything deeper than  that so i had no idea what to expect  from this place but it's been a nice  surprise i can say iran is almost
lm4J1TatFyE,7931599,7939119,disappointingly  normal does that make sense yes it does  and it's a safe country iran is very
lm4J1TatFyE,7939119,7946159,safe  wherever i go you're going to see  there's a very small portion of  representation on the news but when you
lm4J1TatFyE,7946159,7950960,go to each country it's about the people  what the people are doing
lm4J1TatFyE,7951360,7957520,it's good for me to see just a normal  everyday slice of life here in iran  thank you for that
lm4J1TatFyE,7957520,7965840,thank you for choosing us yes  [Music]
lm4J1TatFyE,7965840,7972480,i came to iran and it was nothing like  the news showed me  one of the most destructive forces today
lm4J1TatFyE,7972480,7980560,is the ability for corporatized news to  influence popular opinions simply with  what they choose to show or not show
lm4J1TatFyE,7980560,7986880,video is powerful  so perhaps this series could be  considered the anti-news a fresh
lm4J1TatFyE,7986880,7991280,perspective from an angle that's rarely  covered
lm4J1TatFyE,7992719,7999599,the people of iran are open-minded kind  and hospitable  it's not a click-bait headline but
lm4J1TatFyE,7999599,8004719,it's the truth  well guys that wraps up the iran series
lm4J1TatFyE,8004719,8010159,i wanted to say a huge thank you to this  guy amir amir let's shake hands on  camera i wouldn't be here if it wasn't
lm4J1TatFyE,8010159,8016719,for him and his company called harry  amir brought us here coming to iran to  shoot is not the most easy process but
lm4J1TatFyE,8016719,8022800,he made it possible can i also say  special thanks to everyone who helped us  with this project acd another sponsor
lm4J1TatFyE,8022800,8031040,who made it possible all our tour guides  all the people behind the scenes  throughout the whole trip thank you so  much i will see all of you next time
lm4J1TatFyE,8031040,8038440,what are you doing  a piece  like you haven't seen me do it a  thousand times by now
lm4J1TatFyE,8038480,8041920,that's how you do it
