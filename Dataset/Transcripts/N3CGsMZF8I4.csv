N3CGsMZF8I4,13427,16650,Does it look good on screen?  Holy Cow!
N3CGsMZF8I4,19752,20521,"Good, God!"
N3CGsMZF8I4,35381,40507,Japanese love taking pictures.  Like this.  Let them see my face!
N3CGsMZF8I4,50898,53474,There are no small octopuses in my shop.  They're all huge.
N3CGsMZF8I4,57183,62964,"(Is this different from that?)  Yeah, It's different.  See, This one is red."
N3CGsMZF8I4,68891,74203,When you look closely  this area should not be thin.
N3CGsMZF8I4,74950,80596,"It has to be thick.  It has to be thick.  If it's thin,"
N3CGsMZF8I4,81267,86687,"There's going to be a hole  if you put your hand in it.  It's a cheap one.  If you look at this,"
N3CGsMZF8I4,87237,90691,That's what happens here.  Do you see the gigantic one?
N3CGsMZF8I4,96480,101639,We can't sell this big one because
N3CGsMZF8I4,102381,107642,"you can see it's wrinkled and easily punctured.  You can see the hole, right?"
N3CGsMZF8I4,107667,112513,"Yeah.  When the octopus got plumped,  after fattened,  they are firm."
N3CGsMZF8I4,113094,119979,We can't make a hole in it.  But  as you can see  a finger is just sticking out
N3CGsMZF8I4,120017,126326,See?  We can't sell this.  We can tell.
N3CGsMZF8I4,126351,132633,We are selling the good ones only after separating.  I mean NEVER!  You can't sell those kinds.
N3CGsMZF8I4,135503,139840,"We have an even bigger one.  A bigger one?  Yeah, bigger.  Where?"
N3CGsMZF8I4,151210,156456,"See? It's different, right?  This one lives below 100M deep,"
N3CGsMZF8I4,157293,160794,and this one lives between 150M and 200M.
N3CGsMZF8I4,210419,216316,"People usually think this part is the head,  but it's actually the body of an octopus.  This part is the body and these are the eyes."
N3CGsMZF8I4,216938,220487,You can think of this as the head.  And it's the arms.
N3CGsMZF8I4,223996,226193,They are using these suckers to absorb.
N3CGsMZF8I4,229416,234067,"If you look at it, it's like squid's mouth.  It's the same as a squid."
N3CGsMZF8I4,234635,240403,They pop out.  Here we go.
N3CGsMZF8I4,240403,244444,There's a membrane here.  No 1  This is the first step.
N3CGsMZF8I4,245435,250517,"No 2  And flipping~  Okay, number three is here."
N3CGsMZF8I4,251429,257298,"No 3  No 4  Now,  No 5"
N3CGsMZF8I4,260459,262262,This is what the octopus is eating.
N3CGsMZF8I4,275713,280597,Let's wash it up.  OK!  No 6
N3CGsMZF8I4,281432,286102,No 7  No 8  Now the gut is out.
N3CGsMZF8I4,290052,296363,"And the next,  here  No 9  Now 10"
N3CGsMZF8I4,299091,300000,11
N3CGsMZF8I4,308036,312513,And the next is the eyes.  It can be yucky.
N3CGsMZF8I4,322803,327060,We will not tie a string.  That's how we do nowadays.
N3CGsMZF8I4,330961,333934,"Now, this part is done."
N3CGsMZF8I4,337078,343509,"These days  we can see a lot of them preparing the entrails.  If you look at the insides, number one,"
N3CGsMZF8I4,345495,350684,2  3
N3CGsMZF8I4,355941,362930,"Whew, that is a lot!  And this is the throat lining."
N3CGsMZF8I4,367565,372472,"throat lining.  It's over when it bursts. I mean, totally."
N3CGsMZF8I4,376331,381215,Now we will prepare eatable parts.  We will cook them for you.
N3CGsMZF8I4,509296,514648,"If you cook them the Andong style,  you need to boil them a little bit more and then pull them out.  But"
N3CGsMZF8I4,515000,520086,we cook them much longer here in Pohang.  Way more!
N3CGsMZF8I4,521513,529755,"You know, these two arms usually have a lot of scars  because the octopus uses them to hunt their prey."
N3CGsMZF8I4,553312,554588,Impurities float like this.
N3CGsMZF8I4,581412,586920,It's done when this white area turned red.
N3CGsMZF8I4,603927,607941,"This part doesn't cook easily,  so we need to cut them like this."
N3CGsMZF8I4,615296,617924,We'll have to boil it for another five minutes.
N3CGsMZF8I4,671231,675742,So this is the internal organs.  internal organs.  The one I prepared earlier.
N3CGsMZF8I4,681147,687287,"So these are the lungs,  and then  gizzard,"
N3CGsMZF8I4,688761,690824,It's a gizzard.  a gizzard.
N3CGsMZF8I4,727273,733071,How long does it take to cool off?  Until a crease is formed  right here.
N3CGsMZF8I4,733096,734368,About 15 minutes?
N3CGsMZF8I4,742349,746311,"If you touch it,  The temperature makes a lot of differences."
N3CGsMZF8I4,820968,826593,The reason I'm poking is to get some water out.  The octopus has a lot of moisture.
N3CGsMZF8I4,887872,889389,This is the lung.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1008325,1010110,"Oh, It's a good one!"
N3CGsMZF8I4,1030421,1034431,Should I cut this first?  What is it?  It's the head.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1038161,1039438,And this is the body.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1043270,1048949,"It's incredible, right?  It looks like tofu, right?  Let's cut it."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1059507,1060896,Now this part.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1066500,1074462,"Here,  in a bite-sized.  The elderly usually love this."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1134875,1139864,That's the front.  This is the back.  You can see tendons here.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1139889,1142643,Yeah.  That's the difference.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1154344,1159559,"Does it taste weird?  (No, It's tasty.)  That's a relief."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1167690,1169101,"God, that's huge!"
N3CGsMZF8I4,1184714,1185953,"OK, I'll keep slice them now."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1208290,1210077,Cut the skin off like this.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1241239,1245412,This part is too thick to chew.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1246628,1248649,Throw them away.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1270453,1271453,Shall I continue?
N3CGsMZF8I4,1342868,1343977,Should I keep piling?
N3CGsMZF8I4,1399071,1401434,"Good, done!  It's a 10kg box."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1455889,1458258,Shooting is harder than I thought!
N3CGsMZF8I4,1573342,1574675,Like this.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1578999,1583149,"If it loses too much moisture,  the skin will be peeled."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1636847,1638438,"You wanted this way, right?"
N3CGsMZF8I4,1676100,1682434,We remove the skin when we deliver them to the funeral homes.  Some people ask us to keep the skin on but we usually peel them off
N3CGsMZF8I4,1682459,1686486,because it's easily stuck in your throat.  So that' why.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1739066,1742771,"You can keep them for two days normally.  Now, this one"
N3CGsMZF8I4,1746093,1750950,About a single serving  this much  about 150g to 200g
N3CGsMZF8I4,1751760,1758492,something like that  This should weight about 80g.  You can keep it like this.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1758942,1763498,The upper part can be stored a little bit longer than  the bottom part
N3CGsMZF8I4,1764652,1769536,"When it's frozen, it'll lose its' sweet taste."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1769959,1772105,"OK, let's see."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1785644,1788955,There are approximately 250 to 300 suckers in one arm.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1792449,1797311,"Now, this is the reproductive organ.  It's genitalia.  a female.."
N3CGsMZF8I4,1798146,1803270,the genitals  private parts  Penis!
N3CGsMZF8I4,1807109,1813413,OK?  Here we go. Stack it up.
N3CGsMZF8I4,1831404,1833184,All good?  Finished!
