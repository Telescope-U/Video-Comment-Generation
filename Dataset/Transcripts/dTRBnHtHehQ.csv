dTRBnHtHehQ,80,1839,i had a purpose i wanted to be one of
dTRBnHtHehQ,1839,4560,the best basketball players to ever play
dTRBnHtHehQ,4560,7040,and anything else that was outside of
dTRBnHtHehQ,7040,8080,that lane
dTRBnHtHehQ,8080,9150,i didn't have time for
dTRBnHtHehQ,9150,12080,[Music]
dTRBnHtHehQ,12080,14559,there's a quote from one of my english
dTRBnHtHehQ,14559,16640,teachers a little marion named uh
dTRBnHtHehQ,16640,19439,mr fisk he had a great quote that said
dTRBnHtHehQ,19439,20480,rest at the end not
dTRBnHtHehQ,20480,23119,in the middle and that's something i
dTRBnHtHehQ,23119,24720,always live by
dTRBnHtHehQ,24720,26480,you know i'm not going to rest i'm going
dTRBnHtHehQ,26480,27760,to keep on pushing now
dTRBnHtHehQ,27760,31119,a lot of answers that i don't have even
dTRBnHtHehQ,31119,31920,questions
dTRBnHtHehQ,31920,33680,that i don't have but i'm just going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,33680,35600,keep going i'm just going to keep going
dTRBnHtHehQ,35600,36880,and i'll figure these things out as you
dTRBnHtHehQ,36880,38719,go right you just continue to build that
dTRBnHtHehQ,38719,39280,way
dTRBnHtHehQ,39280,40879,so that i try to live by that all the
dTRBnHtHehQ,40879,44239,time at what age did that goal become
dTRBnHtHehQ,44239,45280,crystal clear
dTRBnHtHehQ,45280,47440,i made that deal with myself at 13 years
dTRBnHtHehQ,47440,50079,old at 13 years old 13 years old
dTRBnHtHehQ,50079,51840,clear about it crystal clear and where
dTRBnHtHehQ,51840,53600,did inspiration come from
dTRBnHtHehQ,53600,56640,um the love of the game the love of the
dTRBnHtHehQ,56640,58000,game the challenge like i
dTRBnHtHehQ,58000,60160,would watch magic play i'd watch michael
dTRBnHtHehQ,60160,61199,play
dTRBnHtHehQ,61199,62320,and i would see them do these
dTRBnHtHehQ,62320,64878,unbelievable things and i'd say you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,64878,68240,can i get to that level i don't know but
dTRBnHtHehQ,68240,70960,let's find out let's find out and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,70960,72479,that curiosity to see
dTRBnHtHehQ,72479,74560,where i could push this thing let me
dTRBnHtHehQ,74560,76080,down that path i think
dTRBnHtHehQ,76080,77920,i had a summer where i played basketball
dTRBnHtHehQ,77920,79920,when i was like 10 or 11 years old
dTRBnHtHehQ,79920,82560,and here i come playing and i don't
dTRBnHtHehQ,82560,84080,score one point
dTRBnHtHehQ,84080,86560,the entire summer not a free throw not a
dTRBnHtHehQ,86560,88640,nothing not a lucky shot not a breakaway
dTRBnHtHehQ,88640,89040,layup
dTRBnHtHehQ,89040,91360,zero points and i remember crying about
dTRBnHtHehQ,91360,92880,it being upset about it my father just
dTRBnHtHehQ,92880,94640,gave me a hug and said listen
dTRBnHtHehQ,94640,97439,whether you scored zero or score 60 i'm
dTRBnHtHehQ,97439,99040,gonna love you no matter what
dTRBnHtHehQ,99040,101680,wow that is the most important thing
dTRBnHtHehQ,101680,103520,that you can say to a child
dTRBnHtHehQ,103520,105680,because from there i was like okay it
dTRBnHtHehQ,105680,107040,gives me all the confidence in the world
dTRBnHtHehQ,107040,108000,to fail
dTRBnHtHehQ,108000,110640,i have the security there but to hell
dTRBnHtHehQ,110640,111520,with that
dTRBnHtHehQ,111520,113520,i'm scoring 60. from there i just went
dTRBnHtHehQ,113520,114720,to work i just
dTRBnHtHehQ,114720,116240,stayed with him i kept practicing kept
dTRBnHtHehQ,116240,118240,practicing came project
dTRBnHtHehQ,118240,120000,i think that's when the idea of
dTRBnHtHehQ,120000,122320,understanding a long-term view
dTRBnHtHehQ,122320,124479,became important because i wasn't going
dTRBnHtHehQ,124479,125680,to catch these kids
dTRBnHtHehQ,125680,126960,in a week i wasn't going to catch them
dTRBnHtHehQ,126960,129039,in a year right so that's when i sat
dTRBnHtHehQ,129039,130000,down and said okay
dTRBnHtHehQ,130000,131760,this is going to take some thought all
dTRBnHtHehQ,131760,133840,right what i want to work on first
dTRBnHtHehQ,133840,135280,all right shooting all right let's knock
dTRBnHtHehQ,135280,137040,this out let's focus on this half a year
dTRBnHtHehQ,137040,137680,six months
dTRBnHtHehQ,137680,139840,do nothing but shoot right after that
dTRBnHtHehQ,139840,141120,all right creating your own shot and
dTRBnHtHehQ,141120,142480,then you focus so you start i started
dTRBnHtHehQ,142480,144160,creating a menu of things
dTRBnHtHehQ,144160,145599,when i came back the next summer i was a
dTRBnHtHehQ,145599,147040,little bit better i scored yeah it
dTRBnHtHehQ,147040,147920,wasn't much
dTRBnHtHehQ,147920,150879,right but i scored this is 12 13 12 13.
dTRBnHtHehQ,150879,152400,then 14 came around
dTRBnHtHehQ,152400,155840,back half of 13 14 years old and then i
dTRBnHtHehQ,155840,156640,was just
dTRBnHtHehQ,156640,158800,killing everyone and it happened in two
dTRBnHtHehQ,158800,160160,years and i wasn't expecting to happen
dTRBnHtHehQ,160160,161280,in two years but it did
dTRBnHtHehQ,161280,163200,because what i had to do was work on the
dTRBnHtHehQ,163200,165360,basics and the fundamentals
dTRBnHtHehQ,165360,167840,well they relied on athleticism and
dTRBnHtHehQ,167840,169440,their natural ability
dTRBnHtHehQ,169440,171519,and because i stick to the fundamentals
dTRBnHtHehQ,171519,173120,it just caught up to them
dTRBnHtHehQ,173120,174800,and then my body you know my knees
dTRBnHtHehQ,174800,176800,stopped hurting i grew into my frame
dTRBnHtHehQ,176800,180319,and then it was game wow
dTRBnHtHehQ,180319,182879,were you always competitive from the day
dTRBnHtHehQ,182879,185200,you were born you were super competitive
dTRBnHtHehQ,185200,188239,uh competitive with things that i
dTRBnHtHehQ,188239,190400,i participate in so i like i'll put it
dTRBnHtHehQ,190400,191440,to you this way so like
dTRBnHtHehQ,191440,194560,you know basketball for me was the most
dTRBnHtHehQ,194560,196560,important thing
dTRBnHtHehQ,196560,199360,so everything i saw whether it was tv
dTRBnHtHehQ,199360,201680,shows whether it was books i read
dTRBnHtHehQ,201680,204400,people i talked to everything was done
dTRBnHtHehQ,204400,206239,to try to learn how to become
dTRBnHtHehQ,206239,208560,a better basketball player everything
dTRBnHtHehQ,208560,210159,everything and so when you have that
dTRBnHtHehQ,210159,211440,point of view
dTRBnHtHehQ,211440,213519,then literally the world becomes your
dTRBnHtHehQ,213519,214640,library
dTRBnHtHehQ,214640,216319,to help you to become better at your
dTRBnHtHehQ,216319,220959,craft so at 13 years old i had a
dTRBnHtHehQ,220959,224080,i had a kill list and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,224080,226159,you know they used to do these rankings
dTRBnHtHehQ,226159,227440,it was street and smith
dTRBnHtHehQ,227440,230080,basketball rankings and i was nowhere to
dTRBnHtHehQ,230080,230640,be found
dTRBnHtHehQ,230640,233200,because i was like six four scrawny like
dTRBnHtHehQ,233200,235439,160 pounds soaking wet
dTRBnHtHehQ,235439,238560,so i was like 57 on the list
dTRBnHtHehQ,238560,240959,and so i will look at 56 55 all the way
dTRBnHtHehQ,240959,241920,up to number one
dTRBnHtHehQ,241920,244959,who these players are what club teams
dTRBnHtHehQ,244959,246000,they played for
dTRBnHtHehQ,246000,249120,so when we go on an aau travel circuit i
dTRBnHtHehQ,249120,251760,i got to hunt them down right and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,251760,254080,that became my mission in high school is
dTRBnHtHehQ,254080,254560,to
dTRBnHtHehQ,254560,256959,check off every other person all those
dTRBnHtHehQ,256959,258799,56 other names
dTRBnHtHehQ,258799,261359,hunt them down and knock them down so we
dTRBnHtHehQ,261359,263440,played at 13 i would size you up
dTRBnHtHehQ,263440,264560,and see what your strengths and
dTRBnHtHehQ,264560,266400,weaknesses are how do you approach the
dTRBnHtHehQ,266400,268000,game are you silly about it are you
dTRBnHtHehQ,268000,269680,goofy about it are you good at it just
dTRBnHtHehQ,269680,270960,because you're bigger and stronger than
dTRBnHtHehQ,270960,272160,everybody else
dTRBnHtHehQ,272160,274000,or is there actually thought and skill
dTRBnHtHehQ,274000,275600,that you put into it
dTRBnHtHehQ,275600,277440,right and when i play i'd play to my
dTRBnHtHehQ,277440,279280,weaknesses i always work on the things
dTRBnHtHehQ,279280,281360,during those games that i was weak at
dTRBnHtHehQ,281360,284400,left hand pull up jump shot
dTRBnHtHehQ,284400,287919,post game right so i have a strategy
dTRBnHtHehQ,287919,290000,what was really your work ethic like and
dTRBnHtHehQ,290000,292400,for how long did you stay disciplined
dTRBnHtHehQ,292400,295919,um well i mean i mean every day i mean
dTRBnHtHehQ,295919,296720,since you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,296720,299199,20 years it was an everyday process and
dTRBnHtHehQ,299199,300320,trying to figure out shrimps and
dTRBnHtHehQ,300320,302160,weaknesses for example
dTRBnHtHehQ,302160,304560,jumping ability now my vertical was a 40
dTRBnHtHehQ,304560,306320,wasn't a 46 or 40
dTRBnHtHehQ,306320,309600,45 my hands are big but they're not
dTRBnHtHehQ,309600,310479,massive
dTRBnHtHehQ,310479,312000,right so you got to figure out ways to
dTRBnHtHehQ,312000,313840,strengthen them so your hands are strong
dTRBnHtHehQ,313840,315360,enough to be able to palm a ball and do
dTRBnHtHehQ,315360,317039,the things that you need to do
dTRBnHtHehQ,317039,319600,uh quickness i was quick but not
dTRBnHtHehQ,319600,320880,insanely quick
dTRBnHtHehQ,320880,323440,i was fast but not ridiculously fast
dTRBnHtHehQ,323440,325520,right so i had to
dTRBnHtHehQ,325520,328400,rely on skill a lot more i had to rely
dTRBnHtHehQ,328400,330320,on angles a lot more i had to study the
dTRBnHtHehQ,330320,330960,game
dTRBnHtHehQ,330960,333840,a lot more and uh but i enjoyed it
dTRBnHtHehQ,333840,335600,though so like from the time i was
dTRBnHtHehQ,335600,337120,i can't remember when i started watching
dTRBnHtHehQ,337120,339199,the game i studied the game
dTRBnHtHehQ,339199,340960,and it just never changed what does
dTRBnHtHehQ,340960,343360,losing feel like to you
dTRBnHtHehQ,343360,348000,oh it's exciting why is it exciting
dTRBnHtHehQ,348000,351440,because it means you have different ways
dTRBnHtHehQ,351440,352960,to get better there are certain things
dTRBnHtHehQ,352960,354800,that you can figure out that you can
dTRBnHtHehQ,354800,356240,take advantage of
dTRBnHtHehQ,356240,358000,right certain weaknesses that were
dTRBnHtHehQ,358000,359360,exposed
dTRBnHtHehQ,359360,362240,um that you need to shore up right so it
dTRBnHtHehQ,362240,364319,was exciting i mean it
dTRBnHtHehQ,364319,366240,sucks to lose but the hardest thing is
dTRBnHtHehQ,366240,369120,to face that stuff
dTRBnHtHehQ,369120,371680,that's a really really tough challenge
dTRBnHtHehQ,371680,372720,how did you get
dTRBnHtHehQ,372720,376080,mentally and emotionally so strong where
dTRBnHtHehQ,376080,378639,it doesn't bother you well you know it's
dTRBnHtHehQ,378639,380080,you got to look at the reality of the
dTRBnHtHehQ,380080,380960,situation
dTRBnHtHehQ,380960,382960,you know like for me it's not you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,382960,385039,you kind of got to get over yourself
dTRBnHtHehQ,385039,387120,right and then after that it's okay well
dTRBnHtHehQ,387120,390240,why did those air balls happen
dTRBnHtHehQ,390240,392880,got it i didn't have the legs so you
dTRBnHtHehQ,392880,393840,look at the shot
dTRBnHtHehQ,393840,396000,every shot was online every shot was
dTRBnHtHehQ,396000,398960,online but every shot was short
dTRBnHtHehQ,398960,400960,right i got to get stronger i gotta
dTRBnHtHehQ,400960,402639,train differently the weight training
dTRBnHtHehQ,402639,403680,program that i'm doing
dTRBnHtHehQ,403680,407120,i gotta tailor it for an 82 game
dTRBnHtHehQ,407120,408800,season so that when the playoffs come
dTRBnHtHehQ,408800,410319,around my legs are stronger and that
dTRBnHtHehQ,410319,411440,ball gets there
dTRBnHtHehQ,411440,414319,so i look at it with rationale and say
dTRBnHtHehQ,414319,415759,okay well the reason why i shot air
dTRBnHtHehQ,415759,417199,balls because my legs aren't there
dTRBnHtHehQ,417199,420000,i got all next year they'll be there you
dTRBnHtHehQ,420000,421599,have to do the hard stuff
dTRBnHtHehQ,421599,424880,and watch that game and study that game
dTRBnHtHehQ,424880,427120,to not make those mistakes over and over
dTRBnHtHehQ,427120,428080,again
dTRBnHtHehQ,428080,430000,just because you weren't brave enough to
dTRBnHtHehQ,430000,432000,face it so you got to deal with it
dTRBnHtHehQ,432000,433759,got to deal with it face it learn from
dTRBnHtHehQ,433759,435360,it you don't want to have that feeling
dTRBnHtHehQ,435360,436000,again do you
dTRBnHtHehQ,436000,437680,right so you got to really study it and
dTRBnHtHehQ,437680,440080,face it and uh not to say you'll win the
dTRBnHtHehQ,440080,441360,next time you face but your least
dTRBnHtHehQ,441360,442880,you'll give yourself a better better
dTRBnHtHehQ,442880,446160,chance yeah it's an obsessiveness
dTRBnHtHehQ,446160,447680,that comes along with it you want things
dTRBnHtHehQ,447680,449440,to be as perfect as they can be
dTRBnHtHehQ,449440,450639,understanding that nothing is ever
dTRBnHtHehQ,450639,452800,perfect but the challenge is try to get
dTRBnHtHehQ,452800,454960,them as perfect as they can be
dTRBnHtHehQ,454960,457919,and what can you do it's in your control
dTRBnHtHehQ,457919,459759,so control what you can
dTRBnHtHehQ,459759,461360,you have this mindset but how did you
dTRBnHtHehQ,461360,463520,develop that i don't know if that's what
dTRBnHtHehQ,463520,465039,you call a mom of mindset but how did
dTRBnHtHehQ,465039,467360,you develop that
dTRBnHtHehQ,467360,470479,and when did it start it started in
dTRBnHtHehQ,470479,472720,middle school and high school because a
dTRBnHtHehQ,472720,474000,lot of the kids that i was playing
dTRBnHtHehQ,474000,474560,against
dTRBnHtHehQ,474560,476800,were inner city kids and so you're
dTRBnHtHehQ,476800,477680,looking at me
dTRBnHtHehQ,477680,479680,as if okay this kid's soft they felt
dTRBnHtHehQ,479680,481120,like they could try to be physical or
dTRBnHtHehQ,481120,482479,try to intimidate me and do all this
dTRBnHtHehQ,482479,483919,other stuff which they couldn't
dTRBnHtHehQ,483919,485759,right but now i'm saying okay well
dTRBnHtHehQ,485759,487039,you're trying to attack me how am i
dTRBnHtHehQ,487039,488160,gonna attack you
dTRBnHtHehQ,488160,491280,how can i mentally figure out ways to
dTRBnHtHehQ,491280,493199,break you down how can i show you that
dTRBnHtHehQ,493199,495039,no i have the edge
dTRBnHtHehQ,495039,496720,right and so that's when it first
dTRBnHtHehQ,496720,498560,started for me is figuring out
dTRBnHtHehQ,498560,500080,how to get the upper hand on an opponent
dTRBnHtHehQ,500080,501919,that way and what would you do to
dTRBnHtHehQ,501919,503280,mentally break people down
dTRBnHtHehQ,503280,505039,then one of the things i would do is
dTRBnHtHehQ,505039,506000,while everybody would be at the
dTRBnHtHehQ,506000,507680,cafeteria work you know eating and doing
dTRBnHtHehQ,507680,508960,all sorts of stuff i just go back to the
dTRBnHtHehQ,508960,509520,job
dTRBnHtHehQ,509520,512399,so that was my way of showing them yeah
dTRBnHtHehQ,512399,513518,i may be
dTRBnHtHehQ,513518,515760,from the suburbs but you're not going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,515760,516560,outwork me
dTRBnHtHehQ,516560,519760,wow like i see a lot of players
dTRBnHtHehQ,519760,521680,take vacations with other players that
dTRBnHtHehQ,521680,523120,are close friends
dTRBnHtHehQ,523120,525120,and or just take vacations just to take
dTRBnHtHehQ,525120,527040,vacations or just hang out just to hang
dTRBnHtHehQ,527040,527680,out like i
dTRBnHtHehQ,527680,529420,i'm not i never did that
dTRBnHtHehQ,529420,531519,[Music]
dTRBnHtHehQ,531519,533760,why why didn't you do that well because
dTRBnHtHehQ,533760,535680,when i retire i didn't want to have to
dTRBnHtHehQ,535680,537120,say
dTRBnHtHehQ,537120,540240,i wish i would have done more
dTRBnHtHehQ,540240,542880,i don't want that i play games with the
dTRBnHtHehQ,542880,545200,flu i play games with 102 degree fever
dTRBnHtHehQ,545200,545760,man

dTRBnHtHehQ,559519,560959,there's a lot of days
dTRBnHtHehQ,560959,562959,where you know you can rest and recover
dTRBnHtHehQ,562959,564399,today ain't one of them
dTRBnHtHehQ,564399,566640,your back can bother you any other day

dTRBnHtHehQ,580080,581519,the playoffs
dTRBnHtHehQ,581519,583120,you know exactly what happens in the
dTRBnHtHehQ,583120,584640,game you go up
dTRBnHtHehQ,584640,586080,you're about to take your shot and then
dTRBnHtHehQ,586080,587920,all of a sudden boom
dTRBnHtHehQ,587920,591600,achilles happens right friend of mine
dTRBnHtHehQ,591600,594880,nema he is here just to listen to he
dTRBnHtHehQ,594880,596240,played ball
dTRBnHtHehQ,596240,597760,and he told me says patrick i don't
dTRBnHtHehQ,597760,599760,think you understand he says when i tore
dTRBnHtHehQ,599760,601760,my achilles in high school
dTRBnHtHehQ,601760,604320,there's four friends of mine dragged me
dTRBnHtHehQ,604320,605600,to my husband i was
dTRBnHtHehQ,605600,607120,crying from there straight to the
dTRBnHtHehQ,607120,608720,hospital he says i have no clue
dTRBnHtHehQ,608720,611760,how the hell this guy did it
dTRBnHtHehQ,611760,613600,he went and hit the free throws and then
dTRBnHtHehQ,613600,614800,you walked
dTRBnHtHehQ,614800,617839,off the stage how the hell do you
dTRBnHtHehQ,617839,620160,tolerate that kind of pain
dTRBnHtHehQ,620160,623760,uh you know i i use this i tell this
dTRBnHtHehQ,623760,624480,example
dTRBnHtHehQ,624480,625839,and i think this is the best way to
dTRBnHtHehQ,625839,627760,explain it
dTRBnHtHehQ,627760,630640,you know you have a hamstring injury you
dTRBnHtHehQ,630640,632079,pull your hamstring really really
dTRBnHtHehQ,632079,635120,badly you can barely walk right let
dTRBnHtHehQ,635120,636560,alone play anything
dTRBnHtHehQ,636560,638880,you're at home all of a sudden a fire
dTRBnHtHehQ,638880,641040,breaks out in the home
dTRBnHtHehQ,641040,644240,right your kids are upstairs
dTRBnHtHehQ,644240,647040,wife is wherever she may be you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,647040,647920,going down
dTRBnHtHehQ,647920,650079,i'm willing to bet that you're going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,650079,651600,forget about your hamstring you're going
dTRBnHtHehQ,651600,652880,to sprint upstairs
dTRBnHtHehQ,652880,654800,you're going to grab your kids you'll
dTRBnHtHehQ,654800,655920,make sure your wife's good you're
dTRBnHtHehQ,655920,657200,getting out of that house
dTRBnHtHehQ,657200,660079,and the reason is because the lives of
dTRBnHtHehQ,660079,661120,your family
dTRBnHtHehQ,661120,663680,are more important than the injury of
dTRBnHtHehQ,663680,665440,your hamstring
dTRBnHtHehQ,665440,667440,and so when the game is more important
dTRBnHtHehQ,667440,669440,than the injury itself you don't feel
dTRBnHtHehQ,669440,669920,that
dTRBnHtHehQ,669920,672959,injury not at that time
dTRBnHtHehQ,672959,674560,i went in the trainer's room my kids are
dTRBnHtHehQ,674560,676959,in there and you know they're looking at
dTRBnHtHehQ,676959,678720,you and stuff and i'm looking at them
dTRBnHtHehQ,678720,680320,and i'm like you know it's all right
dTRBnHtHehQ,680320,681839,that's going to be all right it'll be
dTRBnHtHehQ,681839,682240,fine
dTRBnHtHehQ,682240,683519,it'll be all right it'll be all right
dTRBnHtHehQ,683519,685440,it'll be all right as a parent you got
dTRBnHtHehQ,685440,687120,to set the example
dTRBnHtHehQ,687120,688880,you got to set the example this this is
dTRBnHtHehQ,688880,690399,another obstacle
dTRBnHtHehQ,690399,692720,this obstacle cannot define me it's not
dTRBnHtHehQ,692720,694480,going to me it's not going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,694480,697600,be responsible for me stepping away for
dTRBnHtHehQ,697600,699279,the game that i love i'm going to step
dTRBnHtHehQ,699279,699760,away
dTRBnHtHehQ,699760,702560,on my own terms and that's when a
dTRBnHtHehQ,702560,704160,decision was made that you know what
dTRBnHtHehQ,704160,707680,i'm doing it you got to lead by example
dTRBnHtHehQ,707680,709519,as parents you got to lead by example if
dTRBnHtHehQ,709519,711440,you want your kids to do
dTRBnHtHehQ,711440,712880,whatever it is they want to accomplish
dTRBnHtHehQ,712880,715519,in life you have to show them
dTRBnHtHehQ,715519,718000,you got to show them the definition of
dTRBnHtHehQ,718000,719040,greatness is to
dTRBnHtHehQ,719040,721600,inspire the people next to you yeah i
dTRBnHtHehQ,721600,722800,think that's what greatness
dTRBnHtHehQ,722800,724880,is or should be it's not something
dTRBnHtHehQ,724880,726079,that's that
dTRBnHtHehQ,726079,729200,that lives and dies with one person
dTRBnHtHehQ,729200,731600,is how can you inspire a person to then
dTRBnHtHehQ,731600,733200,in turn inspire another person
dTRBnHtHehQ,733200,735360,that inspires another person and that's
dTRBnHtHehQ,735360,736639,how you create something that i think
dTRBnHtHehQ,736639,737920,lasts forever
dTRBnHtHehQ,737920,739600,and i think that's our challenge as
dTRBnHtHehQ,739600,742240,people is to
dTRBnHtHehQ,742240,744320,is to figure out how our story can
dTRBnHtHehQ,744320,746399,impact others and motivate them in a way
dTRBnHtHehQ,746399,750880,to create their own greatness
vid,start,end,text
dTRBnHtHehQ,80,1839,i had a purpose i wanted to be one of
dTRBnHtHehQ,1839,4560,the best basketball players to ever play
dTRBnHtHehQ,4560,7040,and anything else that was outside of
dTRBnHtHehQ,7040,8080,that lane
dTRBnHtHehQ,8080,9150,i didn't have time for
dTRBnHtHehQ,9150,12080,[Music]
dTRBnHtHehQ,12080,14559,there's a quote from one of my english
dTRBnHtHehQ,14559,16640,teachers a little marion named uh
dTRBnHtHehQ,16640,19439,mr fisk he had a great quote that said
dTRBnHtHehQ,19439,20480,rest at the end not
dTRBnHtHehQ,20480,23119,in the middle and that's something i
dTRBnHtHehQ,23119,24720,always live by
dTRBnHtHehQ,24720,26480,you know i'm not going to rest i'm going
dTRBnHtHehQ,26480,27760,to keep on pushing now
dTRBnHtHehQ,27760,31119,a lot of answers that i don't have even
dTRBnHtHehQ,31119,31920,questions
dTRBnHtHehQ,31920,33680,that i don't have but i'm just going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,33680,35600,keep going i'm just going to keep going
dTRBnHtHehQ,35600,36880,and i'll figure these things out as you
dTRBnHtHehQ,36880,38719,go right you just continue to build that
dTRBnHtHehQ,38719,39280,way
dTRBnHtHehQ,39280,40879,so that i try to live by that all the
dTRBnHtHehQ,40879,44239,time at what age did that goal become
dTRBnHtHehQ,44239,45280,crystal clear
dTRBnHtHehQ,45280,47440,i made that deal with myself at 13 years
dTRBnHtHehQ,47440,50079,old at 13 years old 13 years old
dTRBnHtHehQ,50079,51840,clear about it crystal clear and where
dTRBnHtHehQ,51840,53600,did inspiration come from
dTRBnHtHehQ,53600,56640,um the love of the game the love of the
dTRBnHtHehQ,56640,58000,game the challenge like i
dTRBnHtHehQ,58000,60160,would watch magic play i'd watch michael
dTRBnHtHehQ,60160,61199,play
dTRBnHtHehQ,61199,62320,and i would see them do these
dTRBnHtHehQ,62320,64878,unbelievable things and i'd say you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,64878,68240,can i get to that level i don't know but
dTRBnHtHehQ,68240,70960,let's find out let's find out and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,70960,72479,that curiosity to see
dTRBnHtHehQ,72479,74560,where i could push this thing let me
dTRBnHtHehQ,74560,76080,down that path i think
dTRBnHtHehQ,76080,77920,i had a summer where i played basketball
dTRBnHtHehQ,77920,79920,when i was like 10 or 11 years old
dTRBnHtHehQ,79920,82560,and here i come playing and i don't
dTRBnHtHehQ,82560,84080,score one point
dTRBnHtHehQ,84080,86560,the entire summer not a free throw not a
dTRBnHtHehQ,86560,88640,nothing not a lucky shot not a breakaway
dTRBnHtHehQ,88640,89040,layup
dTRBnHtHehQ,89040,91360,zero points and i remember crying about
dTRBnHtHehQ,91360,92880,it being upset about it my father just
dTRBnHtHehQ,92880,94640,gave me a hug and said listen
dTRBnHtHehQ,94640,97439,whether you scored zero or score 60 i'm
dTRBnHtHehQ,97439,99040,gonna love you no matter what
dTRBnHtHehQ,99040,101680,wow that is the most important thing
dTRBnHtHehQ,101680,103520,that you can say to a child
dTRBnHtHehQ,103520,105680,because from there i was like okay it
dTRBnHtHehQ,105680,107040,gives me all the confidence in the world
dTRBnHtHehQ,107040,108000,to fail
dTRBnHtHehQ,108000,110640,i have the security there but to hell
dTRBnHtHehQ,110640,111520,with that
dTRBnHtHehQ,111520,113520,i'm scoring 60. from there i just went
dTRBnHtHehQ,113520,114720,to work i just
dTRBnHtHehQ,114720,116240,stayed with him i kept practicing kept
dTRBnHtHehQ,116240,118240,practicing came project
dTRBnHtHehQ,118240,120000,i think that's when the idea of
dTRBnHtHehQ,120000,122320,understanding a long-term view
dTRBnHtHehQ,122320,124479,became important because i wasn't going
dTRBnHtHehQ,124479,125680,to catch these kids
dTRBnHtHehQ,125680,126960,in a week i wasn't going to catch them
dTRBnHtHehQ,126960,129039,in a year right so that's when i sat
dTRBnHtHehQ,129039,130000,down and said okay
dTRBnHtHehQ,130000,131760,this is going to take some thought all
dTRBnHtHehQ,131760,133840,right what i want to work on first
dTRBnHtHehQ,133840,135280,all right shooting all right let's knock
dTRBnHtHehQ,135280,137040,this out let's focus on this half a year
dTRBnHtHehQ,137040,137680,six months
dTRBnHtHehQ,137680,139840,do nothing but shoot right after that
dTRBnHtHehQ,139840,141120,all right creating your own shot and
dTRBnHtHehQ,141120,142480,then you focus so you start i started
dTRBnHtHehQ,142480,144160,creating a menu of things
dTRBnHtHehQ,144160,145599,when i came back the next summer i was a
dTRBnHtHehQ,145599,147040,little bit better i scored yeah it
dTRBnHtHehQ,147040,147920,wasn't much
dTRBnHtHehQ,147920,150879,right but i scored this is 12 13 12 13.
dTRBnHtHehQ,150879,152400,then 14 came around
dTRBnHtHehQ,152400,155840,back half of 13 14 years old and then i
dTRBnHtHehQ,155840,156640,was just
dTRBnHtHehQ,156640,158800,killing everyone and it happened in two
dTRBnHtHehQ,158800,160160,years and i wasn't expecting to happen
dTRBnHtHehQ,160160,161280,in two years but it did
dTRBnHtHehQ,161280,163200,because what i had to do was work on the
dTRBnHtHehQ,163200,165360,basics and the fundamentals
dTRBnHtHehQ,165360,167840,well they relied on athleticism and
dTRBnHtHehQ,167840,169440,their natural ability
dTRBnHtHehQ,169440,171519,and because i stick to the fundamentals
dTRBnHtHehQ,171519,173120,it just caught up to them
dTRBnHtHehQ,173120,174800,and then my body you know my knees
dTRBnHtHehQ,174800,176800,stopped hurting i grew into my frame
dTRBnHtHehQ,176800,180319,and then it was game wow
dTRBnHtHehQ,180319,182879,were you always competitive from the day
dTRBnHtHehQ,182879,185200,you were born you were super competitive
dTRBnHtHehQ,185200,188239,uh competitive with things that i
dTRBnHtHehQ,188239,190400,i participate in so i like i'll put it
dTRBnHtHehQ,190400,191440,to you this way so like
dTRBnHtHehQ,191440,194560,you know basketball for me was the most
dTRBnHtHehQ,194560,196560,important thing
dTRBnHtHehQ,196560,199360,so everything i saw whether it was tv
dTRBnHtHehQ,199360,201680,shows whether it was books i read
dTRBnHtHehQ,201680,204400,people i talked to everything was done
dTRBnHtHehQ,204400,206239,to try to learn how to become
dTRBnHtHehQ,206239,208560,a better basketball player everything
dTRBnHtHehQ,208560,210159,everything and so when you have that
dTRBnHtHehQ,210159,211440,point of view
dTRBnHtHehQ,211440,213519,then literally the world becomes your
dTRBnHtHehQ,213519,214640,library
dTRBnHtHehQ,214640,216319,to help you to become better at your
dTRBnHtHehQ,216319,220959,craft so at 13 years old i had a
dTRBnHtHehQ,220959,224080,i had a kill list and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,224080,226159,you know they used to do these rankings
dTRBnHtHehQ,226159,227440,it was street and smith
dTRBnHtHehQ,227440,230080,basketball rankings and i was nowhere to
dTRBnHtHehQ,230080,230640,be found
dTRBnHtHehQ,230640,233200,because i was like six four scrawny like
dTRBnHtHehQ,233200,235439,160 pounds soaking wet
dTRBnHtHehQ,235439,238560,so i was like 57 on the list
dTRBnHtHehQ,238560,240959,and so i will look at 56 55 all the way
dTRBnHtHehQ,240959,241920,up to number one
dTRBnHtHehQ,241920,244959,who these players are what club teams
dTRBnHtHehQ,244959,246000,they played for
dTRBnHtHehQ,246000,249120,so when we go on an aau travel circuit i
dTRBnHtHehQ,249120,251760,i got to hunt them down right and so
dTRBnHtHehQ,251760,254080,that became my mission in high school is
dTRBnHtHehQ,254080,254560,to
dTRBnHtHehQ,254560,256959,check off every other person all those
dTRBnHtHehQ,256959,258799,56 other names
dTRBnHtHehQ,258799,261359,hunt them down and knock them down so we
dTRBnHtHehQ,261359,263440,played at 13 i would size you up
dTRBnHtHehQ,263440,264560,and see what your strengths and
dTRBnHtHehQ,264560,266400,weaknesses are how do you approach the
dTRBnHtHehQ,266400,268000,game are you silly about it are you
dTRBnHtHehQ,268000,269680,goofy about it are you good at it just
dTRBnHtHehQ,269680,270960,because you're bigger and stronger than
dTRBnHtHehQ,270960,272160,everybody else
dTRBnHtHehQ,272160,274000,or is there actually thought and skill
dTRBnHtHehQ,274000,275600,that you put into it
dTRBnHtHehQ,275600,277440,right and when i play i'd play to my
dTRBnHtHehQ,277440,279280,weaknesses i always work on the things
dTRBnHtHehQ,279280,281360,during those games that i was weak at
dTRBnHtHehQ,281360,284400,left hand pull up jump shot
dTRBnHtHehQ,284400,287919,post game right so i have a strategy
dTRBnHtHehQ,287919,290000,what was really your work ethic like and
dTRBnHtHehQ,290000,292400,for how long did you stay disciplined
dTRBnHtHehQ,292400,295919,um well i mean i mean every day i mean
dTRBnHtHehQ,295919,296720,since you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,296720,299199,20 years it was an everyday process and
dTRBnHtHehQ,299199,300320,trying to figure out shrimps and
dTRBnHtHehQ,300320,302160,weaknesses for example
dTRBnHtHehQ,302160,304560,jumping ability now my vertical was a 40
dTRBnHtHehQ,304560,306320,wasn't a 46 or 40
dTRBnHtHehQ,306320,309600,45 my hands are big but they're not
dTRBnHtHehQ,309600,310479,massive
dTRBnHtHehQ,310479,312000,right so you got to figure out ways to
dTRBnHtHehQ,312000,313840,strengthen them so your hands are strong
dTRBnHtHehQ,313840,315360,enough to be able to palm a ball and do
dTRBnHtHehQ,315360,317039,the things that you need to do
dTRBnHtHehQ,317039,319600,uh quickness i was quick but not
dTRBnHtHehQ,319600,320880,insanely quick
dTRBnHtHehQ,320880,323440,i was fast but not ridiculously fast
dTRBnHtHehQ,323440,325520,right so i had to
dTRBnHtHehQ,325520,328400,rely on skill a lot more i had to rely
dTRBnHtHehQ,328400,330320,on angles a lot more i had to study the
dTRBnHtHehQ,330320,330960,game
dTRBnHtHehQ,330960,333840,a lot more and uh but i enjoyed it
dTRBnHtHehQ,333840,335600,though so like from the time i was
dTRBnHtHehQ,335600,337120,i can't remember when i started watching
dTRBnHtHehQ,337120,339199,the game i studied the game
dTRBnHtHehQ,339199,340960,and it just never changed what does
dTRBnHtHehQ,340960,343360,losing feel like to you
dTRBnHtHehQ,343360,348000,oh it's exciting why is it exciting
dTRBnHtHehQ,348000,351440,because it means you have different ways
dTRBnHtHehQ,351440,352960,to get better there are certain things
dTRBnHtHehQ,352960,354800,that you can figure out that you can
dTRBnHtHehQ,354800,356240,take advantage of
dTRBnHtHehQ,356240,358000,right certain weaknesses that were
dTRBnHtHehQ,358000,359360,exposed
dTRBnHtHehQ,359360,362240,um that you need to shore up right so it
dTRBnHtHehQ,362240,364319,was exciting i mean it
dTRBnHtHehQ,364319,366240,sucks to lose but the hardest thing is
dTRBnHtHehQ,366240,369120,to face that stuff
dTRBnHtHehQ,369120,371680,that's a really really tough challenge
dTRBnHtHehQ,371680,372720,how did you get
dTRBnHtHehQ,372720,376080,mentally and emotionally so strong where
dTRBnHtHehQ,376080,378639,it doesn't bother you well you know it's
dTRBnHtHehQ,378639,380080,you got to look at the reality of the
dTRBnHtHehQ,380080,380960,situation
dTRBnHtHehQ,380960,382960,you know like for me it's not you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,382960,385039,you kind of got to get over yourself
dTRBnHtHehQ,385039,387120,right and then after that it's okay well
dTRBnHtHehQ,387120,390240,why did those air balls happen
dTRBnHtHehQ,390240,392880,got it i didn't have the legs so you
dTRBnHtHehQ,392880,393840,look at the shot
dTRBnHtHehQ,393840,396000,every shot was online every shot was
dTRBnHtHehQ,396000,398960,online but every shot was short
dTRBnHtHehQ,398960,400960,right i got to get stronger i gotta
dTRBnHtHehQ,400960,402639,train differently the weight training
dTRBnHtHehQ,402639,403680,program that i'm doing
dTRBnHtHehQ,403680,407120,i gotta tailor it for an 82 game
dTRBnHtHehQ,407120,408800,season so that when the playoffs come
dTRBnHtHehQ,408800,410319,around my legs are stronger and that
dTRBnHtHehQ,410319,411440,ball gets there
dTRBnHtHehQ,411440,414319,so i look at it with rationale and say
dTRBnHtHehQ,414319,415759,okay well the reason why i shot air
dTRBnHtHehQ,415759,417199,balls because my legs aren't there
dTRBnHtHehQ,417199,420000,i got all next year they'll be there you
dTRBnHtHehQ,420000,421599,have to do the hard stuff
dTRBnHtHehQ,421599,424880,and watch that game and study that game
dTRBnHtHehQ,424880,427120,to not make those mistakes over and over
dTRBnHtHehQ,427120,428080,again
dTRBnHtHehQ,428080,430000,just because you weren't brave enough to
dTRBnHtHehQ,430000,432000,face it so you got to deal with it
dTRBnHtHehQ,432000,433759,got to deal with it face it learn from
dTRBnHtHehQ,433759,435360,it you don't want to have that feeling
dTRBnHtHehQ,435360,436000,again do you
dTRBnHtHehQ,436000,437680,right so you got to really study it and
dTRBnHtHehQ,437680,440080,face it and uh not to say you'll win the
dTRBnHtHehQ,440080,441360,next time you face but your least
dTRBnHtHehQ,441360,442880,you'll give yourself a better better
dTRBnHtHehQ,442880,446160,chance yeah it's an obsessiveness
dTRBnHtHehQ,446160,447680,that comes along with it you want things
dTRBnHtHehQ,447680,449440,to be as perfect as they can be
dTRBnHtHehQ,449440,450639,understanding that nothing is ever
dTRBnHtHehQ,450639,452800,perfect but the challenge is try to get
dTRBnHtHehQ,452800,454960,them as perfect as they can be
dTRBnHtHehQ,454960,457919,and what can you do it's in your control
dTRBnHtHehQ,457919,459759,so control what you can
dTRBnHtHehQ,459759,461360,you have this mindset but how did you
dTRBnHtHehQ,461360,463520,develop that i don't know if that's what
dTRBnHtHehQ,463520,465039,you call a mom of mindset but how did
dTRBnHtHehQ,465039,467360,you develop that
dTRBnHtHehQ,467360,470479,and when did it start it started in
dTRBnHtHehQ,470479,472720,middle school and high school because a
dTRBnHtHehQ,472720,474000,lot of the kids that i was playing
dTRBnHtHehQ,474000,474560,against
dTRBnHtHehQ,474560,476800,were inner city kids and so you're
dTRBnHtHehQ,476800,477680,looking at me
dTRBnHtHehQ,477680,479680,as if okay this kid's soft they felt
dTRBnHtHehQ,479680,481120,like they could try to be physical or
dTRBnHtHehQ,481120,482479,try to intimidate me and do all this
dTRBnHtHehQ,482479,483919,other stuff which they couldn't
dTRBnHtHehQ,483919,485759,right but now i'm saying okay well
dTRBnHtHehQ,485759,487039,you're trying to attack me how am i
dTRBnHtHehQ,487039,488160,gonna attack you
dTRBnHtHehQ,488160,491280,how can i mentally figure out ways to
dTRBnHtHehQ,491280,493199,break you down how can i show you that
dTRBnHtHehQ,493199,495039,no i have the edge
dTRBnHtHehQ,495039,496720,right and so that's when it first
dTRBnHtHehQ,496720,498560,started for me is figuring out
dTRBnHtHehQ,498560,500080,how to get the upper hand on an opponent
dTRBnHtHehQ,500080,501919,that way and what would you do to
dTRBnHtHehQ,501919,503280,mentally break people down
dTRBnHtHehQ,503280,505039,then one of the things i would do is
dTRBnHtHehQ,505039,506000,while everybody would be at the
dTRBnHtHehQ,506000,507680,cafeteria work you know eating and doing
dTRBnHtHehQ,507680,508960,all sorts of stuff i just go back to the
dTRBnHtHehQ,508960,509520,job
dTRBnHtHehQ,509520,512399,so that was my way of showing them yeah
dTRBnHtHehQ,512399,513518,i may be
dTRBnHtHehQ,513518,515760,from the suburbs but you're not going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,515760,516560,outwork me
dTRBnHtHehQ,516560,519760,wow like i see a lot of players
dTRBnHtHehQ,519760,521680,take vacations with other players that
dTRBnHtHehQ,521680,523120,are close friends
dTRBnHtHehQ,523120,525120,and or just take vacations just to take
dTRBnHtHehQ,525120,527040,vacations or just hang out just to hang
dTRBnHtHehQ,527040,527680,out like i
dTRBnHtHehQ,527680,529420,i'm not i never did that
dTRBnHtHehQ,529420,531519,[Music]
dTRBnHtHehQ,531519,533760,why why didn't you do that well because
dTRBnHtHehQ,533760,535680,when i retire i didn't want to have to
dTRBnHtHehQ,535680,537120,say
dTRBnHtHehQ,537120,540240,i wish i would have done more
dTRBnHtHehQ,540240,542880,i don't want that i play games with the
dTRBnHtHehQ,542880,545200,flu i play games with 102 degree fever
dTRBnHtHehQ,545200,545760,man
dTRBnHtHehQ,545760,550959,we had a game against toronto in 2000
dTRBnHtHehQ,550959,554080,and vince was tearing the league up
dTRBnHtHehQ,554080,557360,my back was jacked jacked
dTRBnHtHehQ,557360,559519,so i would be in a layup line like okay
dTRBnHtHehQ,559519,560959,there's a lot of days
dTRBnHtHehQ,560959,562959,where you know you can rest and recover
dTRBnHtHehQ,562959,564399,today ain't one of them
dTRBnHtHehQ,564399,566640,your back can bother you any other day
dTRBnHtHehQ,566640,568240,that ain't bothering me today we're
dTRBnHtHehQ,568240,568640,gonna
dTRBnHtHehQ,568640,571839,he gonna have to see me today you're
dTRBnHtHehQ,571839,572720,playing
dTRBnHtHehQ,572720,575519,against the golden state warriors score
dTRBnHtHehQ,575519,576800,is 107
dTRBnHtHehQ,576800,580080,109. you guys are close to getting into
dTRBnHtHehQ,580080,581519,the playoffs
dTRBnHtHehQ,581519,583120,you know exactly what happens in the
dTRBnHtHehQ,583120,584640,game you go up
dTRBnHtHehQ,584640,586080,you're about to take your shot and then
dTRBnHtHehQ,586080,587920,all of a sudden boom
dTRBnHtHehQ,587920,591600,achilles happens right friend of mine
dTRBnHtHehQ,591600,594880,nema he is here just to listen to he
dTRBnHtHehQ,594880,596240,played ball
dTRBnHtHehQ,596240,597760,and he told me says patrick i don't
dTRBnHtHehQ,597760,599760,think you understand he says when i tore
dTRBnHtHehQ,599760,601760,my achilles in high school
dTRBnHtHehQ,601760,604320,there's four friends of mine dragged me
dTRBnHtHehQ,604320,605600,to my husband i was
dTRBnHtHehQ,605600,607120,crying from there straight to the
dTRBnHtHehQ,607120,608720,hospital he says i have no clue
dTRBnHtHehQ,608720,611760,how the hell this guy did it
dTRBnHtHehQ,611760,613600,he went and hit the free throws and then
dTRBnHtHehQ,613600,614800,you walked
dTRBnHtHehQ,614800,617839,off the stage how the hell do you
dTRBnHtHehQ,617839,620160,tolerate that kind of pain
dTRBnHtHehQ,620160,623760,uh you know i i use this i tell this
dTRBnHtHehQ,623760,624480,example
dTRBnHtHehQ,624480,625839,and i think this is the best way to
dTRBnHtHehQ,625839,627760,explain it
dTRBnHtHehQ,627760,630640,you know you have a hamstring injury you
dTRBnHtHehQ,630640,632079,pull your hamstring really really
dTRBnHtHehQ,632079,635120,badly you can barely walk right let
dTRBnHtHehQ,635120,636560,alone play anything
dTRBnHtHehQ,636560,638880,you're at home all of a sudden a fire
dTRBnHtHehQ,638880,641040,breaks out in the home
dTRBnHtHehQ,641040,644240,right your kids are upstairs
dTRBnHtHehQ,644240,647040,wife is wherever she may be you know
dTRBnHtHehQ,647040,647920,going down
dTRBnHtHehQ,647920,650079,i'm willing to bet that you're going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,650079,651600,forget about your hamstring you're going
dTRBnHtHehQ,651600,652880,to sprint upstairs
dTRBnHtHehQ,652880,654800,you're going to grab your kids you'll
dTRBnHtHehQ,654800,655920,make sure your wife's good you're
dTRBnHtHehQ,655920,657200,getting out of that house
dTRBnHtHehQ,657200,660079,and the reason is because the lives of
dTRBnHtHehQ,660079,661120,your family
dTRBnHtHehQ,661120,663680,are more important than the injury of
dTRBnHtHehQ,663680,665440,your hamstring
dTRBnHtHehQ,665440,667440,and so when the game is more important
dTRBnHtHehQ,667440,669440,than the injury itself you don't feel
dTRBnHtHehQ,669440,669920,that
dTRBnHtHehQ,669920,672959,injury not at that time
dTRBnHtHehQ,672959,674560,i went in the trainer's room my kids are
dTRBnHtHehQ,674560,676959,in there and you know they're looking at
dTRBnHtHehQ,676959,678720,you and stuff and i'm looking at them
dTRBnHtHehQ,678720,680320,and i'm like you know it's all right
dTRBnHtHehQ,680320,681839,that's going to be all right it'll be
dTRBnHtHehQ,681839,682240,fine
dTRBnHtHehQ,682240,683519,it'll be all right it'll be all right
dTRBnHtHehQ,683519,685440,it'll be all right as a parent you got
dTRBnHtHehQ,685440,687120,to set the example
dTRBnHtHehQ,687120,688880,you got to set the example this this is
dTRBnHtHehQ,688880,690399,another obstacle
dTRBnHtHehQ,690399,692720,this obstacle cannot define me it's not
dTRBnHtHehQ,692720,694480,going to me it's not going to
dTRBnHtHehQ,694480,697600,be responsible for me stepping away for
dTRBnHtHehQ,697600,699279,the game that i love i'm going to step
dTRBnHtHehQ,699279,699760,away
dTRBnHtHehQ,699760,702560,on my own terms and that's when a
dTRBnHtHehQ,702560,704160,decision was made that you know what
dTRBnHtHehQ,704160,707680,i'm doing it you got to lead by example
dTRBnHtHehQ,707680,709519,as parents you got to lead by example if
dTRBnHtHehQ,709519,711440,you want your kids to do
dTRBnHtHehQ,711440,712880,whatever it is they want to accomplish
dTRBnHtHehQ,712880,715519,in life you have to show them
dTRBnHtHehQ,715519,718000,you got to show them the definition of
dTRBnHtHehQ,718000,719040,greatness is to
dTRBnHtHehQ,719040,721600,inspire the people next to you yeah i
dTRBnHtHehQ,721600,722800,think that's what greatness
dTRBnHtHehQ,722800,724880,is or should be it's not something
dTRBnHtHehQ,724880,726079,that's that
dTRBnHtHehQ,726079,729200,that lives and dies with one person
dTRBnHtHehQ,729200,731600,is how can you inspire a person to then
dTRBnHtHehQ,731600,733200,in turn inspire another person
dTRBnHtHehQ,733200,735360,that inspires another person and that's
dTRBnHtHehQ,735360,736639,how you create something that i think
dTRBnHtHehQ,736639,737920,lasts forever
dTRBnHtHehQ,737920,739600,and i think that's our challenge as
dTRBnHtHehQ,739600,742240,people is to
dTRBnHtHehQ,742240,744320,is to figure out how our story can
dTRBnHtHehQ,744320,746399,impact others and motivate them in a way
dTRBnHtHehQ,746399,750880,to create their own greatness
