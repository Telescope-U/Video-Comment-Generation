zDZFcDGpL4U,15040,17119,every country on earth at the moment is
zDZFcDGpL4U,17119,19520,reforming public education there are two
zDZFcDGpL4U,19520,21199,reasons for it
zDZFcDGpL4U,21199,22880,the first of them is economic people are
zDZFcDGpL4U,22880,26080,trying to work out how do we
zDZFcDGpL4U,26080,28320,educate our children to take their place
zDZFcDGpL4U,28320,30320,in the economies of the 21st century how
zDZFcDGpL4U,30320,31519,do we do that
zDZFcDGpL4U,31519,33920,given that we can't anticipate what the
zDZFcDGpL4U,33920,35120,economy will look like at the end of
zDZFcDGpL4U,35120,36880,next week
zDZFcDGpL4U,36880,40239,as the recent turmoil is demonstrating
zDZFcDGpL4U,40239,42000,how do we do that
zDZFcDGpL4U,42000,43840,the second though is cultural every
zDZFcDGpL4U,43840,45360,country on earth on earth is trying to
zDZFcDGpL4U,45360,47600,figure out how do we
zDZFcDGpL4U,47600,48960,educate our children so they have a
zDZFcDGpL4U,48960,50960,sense of cultural identity and so that
zDZFcDGpL4U,50960,53280,we can pass on the cultural genes of our
zDZFcDGpL4U,53280,54559,communities
zDZFcDGpL4U,54559,56160,while being part of the process of
zDZFcDGpL4U,56160,58239,globalization how do you square that
zDZFcDGpL4U,58239,59760,circle
zDZFcDGpL4U,59760,62399,the problem is they're trying to meet
zDZFcDGpL4U,62399,64320,the future by doing what they did in the
zDZFcDGpL4U,64320,65280,past
zDZFcDGpL4U,65280,67200,and on the way they're alienating
zDZFcDGpL4U,67200,68880,millions of kids who don't see any
zDZFcDGpL4U,68880,70880,purpose in going to school
zDZFcDGpL4U,70880,72400,when we went to school
zDZFcDGpL4U,72400,74080,we were kept there with a story which is
zDZFcDGpL4U,74080,76080,if you worked hard and did well and got
zDZFcDGpL4U,76080,78240,a college degree you would have a job
zDZFcDGpL4U,78240,80240,our kids don't believe that and they're
zDZFcDGpL4U,80240,81920,right not to by the way you're better
zDZFcDGpL4U,81920,83759,having a degree than not but it's not a
zDZFcDGpL4U,83759,86159,guarantee anymore and particularly not
zDZFcDGpL4U,86159,89040,if the route to it marginalizes most of
zDZFcDGpL4U,89040,90079,things that you think are important
zDZFcDGpL4U,90079,91200,about yourself
zDZFcDGpL4U,91200,92320,some people say we have to raise
zDZFcDGpL4U,92320,94159,standards if this is a breakthrough
zDZFcDGpL4U,94159,95040,you know
zDZFcDGpL4U,95040,97759,like really yes we should
zDZFcDGpL4U,97759,100640,why would you lower them you know i mean
zDZFcDGpL4U,100640,102000,i haven't come across an argument that
zDZFcDGpL4U,102000,103759,persuades me of lowering them
zDZFcDGpL4U,103759,105119,but raising them of course we should
zDZFcDGpL4U,105119,106320,raise them
zDZFcDGpL4U,106320,108320,the problem is that the current system
zDZFcDGpL4U,108320,110880,of education was designed
zDZFcDGpL4U,110880,112479,and conceived
zDZFcDGpL4U,112479,115840,and structured for a different age
zDZFcDGpL4U,115840,117680,it was conceived
zDZFcDGpL4U,117680,120079,in the intellectual culture of the
zDZFcDGpL4U,120079,122000,enlightenment
zDZFcDGpL4U,122000,123920,and in the economic circumstances of the
zDZFcDGpL4U,123920,126240,industrial revolution
zDZFcDGpL4U,126240,127680,before the middle of the 19th century
zDZFcDGpL4U,127680,129039,there were no systems of public
zDZFcDGpL4U,129039,130479,education
zDZFcDGpL4U,130479,131920,not really i mean you could get educated
zDZFcDGpL4U,131920,134480,by jesuits you know if you had the money
zDZFcDGpL4U,134480,136560,but public education paid for from
zDZFcDGpL4U,136560,138959,taxation compulsory to everybody and
zDZFcDGpL4U,138959,140480,three at the point of delivery that was
zDZFcDGpL4U,140480,142480,a revolutionary idea
zDZFcDGpL4U,142480,144959,and many people objected to it they said
zDZFcDGpL4U,144959,147200,it's not possible
zDZFcDGpL4U,147200,149040,for many street kids working-class
zDZFcDGpL4U,149040,150400,children to benefit from public
zDZFcDGpL4U,150400,152080,education they're incapable of learning
zDZFcDGpL4U,152080,153360,to read and write and why we're spending
zDZFcDGpL4U,153360,154800,time on this
zDZFcDGpL4U,154800,156319,so there's also built into it a whole
zDZFcDGpL4U,156319,157360,series of
zDZFcDGpL4U,157360,159519,um assumptions about social structure
zDZFcDGpL4U,159519,161519,and capacity it was driven by an
zDZFcDGpL4U,161519,164000,economic imperative of the time but
zDZFcDGpL4U,164000,166000,running right through it
zDZFcDGpL4U,166000,168239,um was an intellectual
zDZFcDGpL4U,168239,171040,model of the mind which was essentially
zDZFcDGpL4U,171040,172720,the enlightenment view of intelligence
zDZFcDGpL4U,172720,174480,that real intelligence consists in this
zDZFcDGpL4U,174480,176160,capacity for a certain type of deductive
zDZFcDGpL4U,176160,177760,reasoning and the knowledge of the
zDZFcDGpL4U,177760,179519,classics originally
zDZFcDGpL4U,179519,181440,what we come to think of as academic
zDZFcDGpL4U,181440,182640,ability
zDZFcDGpL4U,182640,184800,and this is deep in the gene pool of
zDZFcDGpL4U,184800,186720,public education at the really two types
zDZFcDGpL4U,186720,189040,of people academic and non-academic
zDZFcDGpL4U,189040,191280,smart people and non-smart people and
zDZFcDGpL4U,191280,192800,the consequence of that is that many
zDZFcDGpL4U,192800,195680,brilliant people think they're not
zDZFcDGpL4U,195680,197120,because they've been judged against this
zDZFcDGpL4U,197120,199519,particular view of the mind
zDZFcDGpL4U,199519,202080,so we have twin pillars economic and
zDZFcDGpL4U,202080,203200,intellectual
zDZFcDGpL4U,203200,204959,and my view is
zDZFcDGpL4U,204959,208640,that this model has caused chaos in many
zDZFcDGpL4U,208640,210560,people's lives it's been great for some
zDZFcDGpL4U,210560,211840,there have been people who benefited
zDZFcDGpL4U,211840,214400,wonderfully from it but most people have
zDZFcDGpL4U,214400,215680,not
zDZFcDGpL4U,215680,217519,instead they suffer this
zDZFcDGpL4U,217519,219599,this is the modern epidemic and it's as
zDZFcDGpL4U,219599,222560,misplaced and it's as fictitious
zDZFcDGpL4U,222560,226560,this is the plague of adhd
zDZFcDGpL4U,226560,228959,now this is a map of the instance of
zDZFcDGpL4U,228959,232000,adhd in america or prescriptions
zDZFcDGpL4U,232000,233840,for adhd
zDZFcDGpL4U,233840,235680,don't mistake me i don't mean to say
zDZFcDGpL4U,235680,237680,there is no such thing
zDZFcDGpL4U,237680,240000,as attention deficit disorder i'm not
zDZFcDGpL4U,240000,241519,qualified to say if there is such a
zDZFcDGpL4U,241519,243519,thing i know that a great majority of
zDZFcDGpL4U,243519,245360,psychologists and children pediatrician
zDZFcDGpL4U,245360,246879,think there is such a thing
zDZFcDGpL4U,246879,250959,but it's still a matter of debate
zDZFcDGpL4U,250959,253840,what i do know for a fact is it's not an
zDZFcDGpL4U,253840,255280,epidemic
zDZFcDGpL4U,255280,257919,these kids are being medicated
zDZFcDGpL4U,257919,260079,as routinely as we had our tonsils taken
zDZFcDGpL4U,260079,263360,out and on the same whimsical basis and
zDZFcDGpL4U,263360,265280,for the same reason medical
zDZFcDGpL4U,265280,266880,fashion
zDZFcDGpL4U,266880,268800,our children are living in the most
zDZFcDGpL4U,268800,270639,intensely stimulating period in the
zDZFcDGpL4U,270639,273520,history of the earth
zDZFcDGpL4U,273520,275919,they're being besieged with information
zDZFcDGpL4U,275919,278160,and caused their attention from every
zDZFcDGpL4U,278160,280160,platform computers
zDZFcDGpL4U,280160,282560,from iphones from advertising holdings
zDZFcDGpL4U,282560,284800,from hundreds of television channels
zDZFcDGpL4U,284800,286479,and we're penalizing them now for
zDZFcDGpL4U,286479,288639,getting distracted
zDZFcDGpL4U,288639,291919,from what you know boring stuff
zDZFcDGpL4U,291919,294320,at school for the most part
zDZFcDGpL4U,294320,296320,it seems to me not a coincidence totally
zDZFcDGpL4U,296320,298160,that the incidence of adhd has risen in
zDZFcDGpL4U,298160,299600,parallel with the growth of standardized
zDZFcDGpL4U,299600,301199,testing
zDZFcDGpL4U,301199,303280,now these kids are being given ritalin
zDZFcDGpL4U,303280,305120,and adderall and all manner of things
zDZFcDGpL4U,305120,307039,often quite dangerous drugs
zDZFcDGpL4U,307039,310000,to get them focused and calm them down
zDZFcDGpL4U,310000,312080,but according to this attention deficit
zDZFcDGpL4U,312080,314320,order increases as you travel east
zDZFcDGpL4U,314320,315759,across the country
zDZFcDGpL4U,315759,320120,people start losing interest in oklahoma
zDZFcDGpL4U,324639,326000,they can hardly think straight in
zDZFcDGpL4U,326000,327680,arkansas
zDZFcDGpL4U,327680,328960,and by the time they get to washington
zDZFcDGpL4U,328960,331280,they've lost it completely
zDZFcDGpL4U,331280,332639,and there are separate reasons for that
zDZFcDGpL4U,332639,335039,i believe
zDZFcDGpL4U,335759,338479,it's a fictitious epidemic
zDZFcDGpL4U,338479,340880,if you think of it the arts
zDZFcDGpL4U,340880,342400,and i don't say this exclusively the
zDZFcDGpL4U,342400,344479,arts i think it's also true of science
zDZFcDGpL4U,344479,346479,and of maths but let me i say about the
zDZFcDGpL4U,346479,348400,art particularly because they are the
zDZFcDGpL4U,348400,350479,victims of this mentality currently
zDZFcDGpL4U,350479,352400,particularly
zDZFcDGpL4U,352400,353680,the arts
zDZFcDGpL4U,353680,356400,especially address the idea of
zDZFcDGpL4U,356400,357759,aesthetic
zDZFcDGpL4U,357759,358880,experience
zDZFcDGpL4U,358880,360479,an aesthetic experience is one in which
zDZFcDGpL4U,360479,363360,your senses are operating at their peak
zDZFcDGpL4U,363360,364639,when you're present in the current
zDZFcDGpL4U,364639,366880,moment when you're resonating with the
zDZFcDGpL4U,366880,368880,excitement of this thing that you're
zDZFcDGpL4U,368880,372319,experiencing when you are fully alive
zDZFcDGpL4U,372319,374479,an anesthetic is when you shut your
zDZFcDGpL4U,374479,376160,senses off
zDZFcDGpL4U,376160,379120,and deaden yourself to what's happening
zDZFcDGpL4U,379120,381919,and a lot of these drugs are that
zDZFcDGpL4U,381919,382960,we're getting our children through
zDZFcDGpL4U,382960,385919,education by anesthetizing them
zDZFcDGpL4U,385919,387120,and i think we should be doing the exact
zDZFcDGpL4U,387120,388160,opposite we shouldn't be putting them
zDZFcDGpL4U,388160,390240,asleep we should be waking them up to
zDZFcDGpL4U,390240,392319,what they have inside of themselves
zDZFcDGpL4U,392319,394400,but the model we have is this it's i
zDZFcDGpL4U,394400,396240,believe we have a system of education
zDZFcDGpL4U,396240,398960,that is modeled on
zDZFcDGpL4U,398960,401680,the interests of industrialism
zDZFcDGpL4U,401680,403280,and in the image of it
zDZFcDGpL4U,403280,405520,i'll give you a couple of examples uh
zDZFcDGpL4U,405520,407199,schools are still pretty much organized
zDZFcDGpL4U,407199,409599,on factory lines ringing bells separate
zDZFcDGpL4U,409599,411120,facilities
zDZFcDGpL4U,411120,414080,specialized into separate subjects
zDZFcDGpL4U,414080,416960,we still educate children by batches
zDZFcDGpL4U,416960,418400,you know we put them through the system
zDZFcDGpL4U,418400,420080,by age group
zDZFcDGpL4U,420080,422240,why do we do that you know why is there
zDZFcDGpL4U,422240,423440,this assumption
zDZFcDGpL4U,423440,424880,that the most important thing kids have
zDZFcDGpL4U,424880,427440,in common is how old they are
zDZFcDGpL4U,427440,428560,you know it's like the most important
zDZFcDGpL4U,428560,429440,thing about them is their date of
zDZFcDGpL4U,429440,430800,manufacture
zDZFcDGpL4U,430800,431919,what do you mean
zDZFcDGpL4U,431919,433440,well i know kids who are much better
zDZFcDGpL4U,433440,434560,than other kids at the same age in
zDZFcDGpL4U,434560,436720,different disciplines you know or at
zDZFcDGpL4U,436720,438319,different times of the day
zDZFcDGpL4U,438319,439680,or better in smaller groups than in
zDZFcDGpL4U,439680,441039,large groups or sometimes they want to
zDZFcDGpL4U,441039,442160,be on their own
zDZFcDGpL4U,442160,443280,if you're interested in the model of
zDZFcDGpL4U,443280,444639,learning you don't start from this
zDZFcDGpL4U,444639,447039,production line mentality these are it's
zDZFcDGpL4U,447039,448400,essentially about conformity and
zDZFcDGpL4U,448400,449759,increasingly it's about that as you look
zDZFcDGpL4U,449759,451120,at the growth of standardized testing
zDZFcDGpL4U,451120,453280,and standardized curricula
zDZFcDGpL4U,453280,455360,and it's about standardization
zDZFcDGpL4U,455360,456479,i believe we've got to go in the exact
zDZFcDGpL4U,456479,458240,opposite direction that's what i mean
zDZFcDGpL4U,458240,460080,about changing the paradigm
zDZFcDGpL4U,460080,461919,there was a great study done recently of
zDZFcDGpL4U,461919,464639,divergent thinking
zDZFcDGpL4U,464639,465520,published a couple of years ago
zDZFcDGpL4U,465520,467680,divergent thinking isn't the same thing
zDZFcDGpL4U,467680,469199,as creativity
zDZFcDGpL4U,469199,471039,i define creativity as the the process
zDZFcDGpL4U,471039,474400,of having original ideas that have value
zDZFcDGpL4U,474400,477039,divergent thinking isn't a synonym
zDZFcDGpL4U,477039,478560,but it's a
zDZFcDGpL4U,478560,479840,an essential
zDZFcDGpL4U,479840,481919,capacity for creativity
zDZFcDGpL4U,481919,483840,it's the ability to see lots of possible
zDZFcDGpL4U,483840,484879,answers
zDZFcDGpL4U,484879,486800,to a question lots of possible ways of
zDZFcDGpL4U,486800,489759,interpreting a question uh to think
zDZFcDGpL4U,489759,490879,what edward de boehner would probably
zDZFcDGpL4U,490879,492400,call laterally
zDZFcDGpL4U,492400,495199,to think not just in linear or
zDZFcDGpL4U,495199,497039,convergent ways
zDZFcDGpL4U,497039,499440,to see multiple answers not one
zDZFcDGpL4U,499440,501120,so i mean the test for this i mean one
zDZFcDGpL4U,501120,502479,kind of cod example would be people
zDZFcDGpL4U,502479,503919,might be asked to say
zDZFcDGpL4U,503919,506000,how many uses can you think of for a
zDZFcDGpL4U,506000,508000,paper clip
zDZFcDGpL4U,508000,509680,all those routine questions most people
zDZFcDGpL4U,509680,511599,might come with 10 or 15.
zDZFcDGpL4U,511599,512719,people are good at this might come up
zDZFcDGpL4U,512719,514399,with 200
zDZFcDGpL4U,514399,516080,and they do that by saying well could
zDZFcDGpL4U,516080,517599,the paper clip be 200 foot tall and be
zDZFcDGpL4U,517599,519039,made out of foam rubber
zDZFcDGpL4U,519039,520320,you know like does it have to be a paper
zDZFcDGpL4U,520320,522320,clip as we know it jim you know
zDZFcDGpL4U,522320,524159,um now they tested this and they gave
zDZFcDGpL4U,524159,526959,them to 1500 people in a book called
zDZFcDGpL4U,526959,528880,breakpoint and beyond
zDZFcDGpL4U,528880,530480,and on the protocol of the test if you
zDZFcDGpL4U,530480,532880,scored above a certain level
zDZFcDGpL4U,532880,534320,you'd be considered to be a genius at
zDZFcDGpL4U,534320,536160,divergent thinking
zDZFcDGpL4U,536160,537200,okay
zDZFcDGpL4U,537200,539600,so my question to you is what percentage
zDZFcDGpL4U,539600,540480,of
zDZFcDGpL4U,540480,543200,the people tested of the 1500
zDZFcDGpL4U,543200,545120,scored at genius level for divergent
zDZFcDGpL4U,545120,546959,thinking now you need to know one more
zDZFcDGpL4U,546959,549279,thing about them these were kindergarten
zDZFcDGpL4U,549279,550720,children
zDZFcDGpL4U,550720,552399,so what do you think what percentage at
zDZFcDGpL4U,552399,554240,genius level
zDZFcDGpL4U,554240,556000,eight eighteen
zDZFcDGpL4U,556000,557120,eighty okay
zDZFcDGpL4U,557120,558160,98
zDZFcDGpL4U,558160,559440,now the thing about this was it was a
zDZFcDGpL4U,559440,561440,longitudinal study
zDZFcDGpL4U,561440,564080,so they retested the same children
zDZFcDGpL4U,564080,565680,five years later
zDZFcDGpL4U,565680,568240,age of eight to ten what do you think
zDZFcDGpL4U,568240,569440,15.
zDZFcDGpL4U,569440,571440,they retested this them again
zDZFcDGpL4U,571440,573600,five years later ages
zDZFcDGpL4U,573600,575200,13-15
zDZFcDGpL4U,575200,578480,you can see a trend here can't you
zDZFcDGpL4U,579279,580720,now
zDZFcDGpL4U,580720,583120,this tells an interesting story
zDZFcDGpL4U,583120,584320,because you could have imagined it going
zDZFcDGpL4U,584320,586640,the other way couldn't you
zDZFcDGpL4U,586640,588240,you start off not being very good but
zDZFcDGpL4U,588240,590080,you get better as you get older but this
zDZFcDGpL4U,590080,592480,shows two things one is we all have this
zDZFcDGpL4U,592480,594399,capacity
zDZFcDGpL4U,594399,597040,and two it mostly deteriorates
zDZFcDGpL4U,597040,598080,now a lot of things have happened to
zDZFcDGpL4U,598080,601040,these kids as they've grown up a lot
zDZFcDGpL4U,601040,602240,but one of the most important things
zDZFcDGpL4U,602240,604079,that i'm convinced is that by now
zDZFcDGpL4U,604079,606240,they've become educated
zDZFcDGpL4U,606240,607519,they know they're spent ten years at
zDZFcDGpL4U,607519,609040,school being told there's one answer
zDZFcDGpL4U,609040,610640,it's at the back
zDZFcDGpL4U,610640,612959,and don't look
zDZFcDGpL4U,612959,614399,and don't copy
zDZFcDGpL4U,614399,616079,because that's cheating
zDZFcDGpL4U,616079,617519,i mean outside schools that's called
zDZFcDGpL4U,617519,619600,collaboration you know but inside
zDZFcDGpL4U,619600,620800,schools
zDZFcDGpL4U,620800,622320,now this isn't because teachers want it
zDZFcDGpL4U,622320,624240,this way it's just because it happens
zDZFcDGpL4U,624240,625839,that way
zDZFcDGpL4U,625839,628560,um it's because it's in the gene pool of
zDZFcDGpL4U,628560,629760,education
zDZFcDGpL4U,629760,631360,we have to think differently about human
zDZFcDGpL4U,631360,633839,capacity we have to get over this old
zDZFcDGpL4U,633839,637200,conception of academic non-academic
zDZFcDGpL4U,637200,640480,abstract theoretical vocational
zDZFcDGpL4U,640480,642720,and see it for what it is
zDZFcDGpL4U,642720,644480,a myth
zDZFcDGpL4U,644480,646079,secondly we have to recognize that most
zDZFcDGpL4U,646079,647839,great learning happens in groups the
zDZFcDGpL4U,647839,650640,collaboration is the stuff of growth
zDZFcDGpL4U,650640,652480,if we atomize people and separate them
zDZFcDGpL4U,652480,654160,and judge them separately
zDZFcDGpL4U,654160,656160,we
zDZFcDGpL4U,656160,657920,form a kind of disjunction between them
zDZFcDGpL4U,657920,659839,and their natural learning environment
zDZFcDGpL4U,659839,661760,and thirdly it's crucially about the
zDZFcDGpL4U,661760,664079,culture of our institutions the habits
zDZFcDGpL4U,664079,666480,of the institution and the habitats that
zDZFcDGpL4U,666480,669720,they occupy
zDZFcDGpL4U,700000,702079,you
