2I_uO2KSA0Y,944800,951440,track sweet skater wow  nice to meet you i'm blippi hi i'm mika  nice to meet you guys
2I_uO2KSA0Y,951440,958240,how long have you been speed skating for  i've been speed skating for about 18  years wow that's a long time so were you
2I_uO2KSA0Y,958240,963600,skating when you were a little kid yeah  i started figure skating when i was  three and then i changed to speed
2I_uO2KSA0Y,963600,970959,skating when i was nine oh  we know what bigger skating is yeah yeah  that's when you go like this
2I_uO2KSA0Y,973920,979959,and then now she is a speed skater so  fast
2I_uO2KSA0Y,982160,987519,and i really like what you're wearing it  looks like you can go really fast in  those clothes yeah so we wear these
2I_uO2KSA0Y,987519,994079,tight suits so that we can go fast and  there's no air resistance so we're  aerodynamic then we wear protective
2I_uO2KSA0Y,994079,999440,gloves and helmets and glasses wow  speaking of gloves look at those
2I_uO2KSA0Y,999440,1004480,yeah what is that those are protective  um so these are so that we can put our
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1004480,1011120,hand down on the ice when we go around  the corners  we're going fast and have to do a tight  corner we put our hand down and it keeps
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1011120,1016480,it gliding wow that's so cool  speaking of cool look at our skates
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1016480,1021920,these are so long yeah our skates are 17  inches long wow
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1021920,1026959,yeah much longer than ours huh blippi  yeah  why are they so long so these help us
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1026959,1033600,get more push off of the ice so we can  go faster  well we're actually trying to become
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1033600,1040160,really great athletes ourselves yeah  maybe you could teach us something about  speed skating yeah so to speed skate we
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1040160,1046798,have to get really low and bring your  knees to a 90 degree angle okay  and then to do a straight away push
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1046798,1052960,you're gonna push to the side  and it'll bring you forward  wow
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1052960,1059840,oh it does feel like you go faster when  you're low like that yeah it's so cool  when you turn your plate you can push
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1059840,1066559,off yeah  so that's how you do a straightaway and  then to do a corner you have to be able
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1066559,1074080,to do crossovers crossovers what's that  yeah so that's where we bring our  outside leg and we bring it over our
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1074080,1080480,inside leg to switch them oh  that's hard you have to practice that  yeah so we can practice that with a
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1080480,1086610,bucket  bucket  yeah so i'll show you guys how to do it  okay
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1086610,1090090,[Music]
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1096640,1101840,wow  that was right you guys want to try oh  try

2I_uO2KSA0Y,1147440,1153679,yeah that was so good guys thank you  and now that we know crossovers and how
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1153679,1159520,to start can we take a lap oh yeah great  so first here we're gonna do a
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1159520,1166240,straightaway push to get into the corner  now at the corner we're gonna do our
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1166240,1172080,crossovers okay whoa  [Music]
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1172080,1177600,good job guys  and now we're back at the straightaway  so we're gonna keep doing those straight

2I_uO2KSA0Y,1757279,1767600,do  [Music]
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1767600,1772960,hey hey guys yeah check it out you made  it  looks like you got some gear with you
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1772960,1778720,yeah what are you doing well so i'm  adjusting the air pressure with this  little air pump wow oh cool so i can hit
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1778720,1786080,some big jumps wow  awesome huh  all right  so i guess we're gonna start off have
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1786080,1792320,either of you snowboarded before nope i  have all right  very good so you know the basics yep so
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1792320,1797520,you're starting from scratch yep all  right well this is gonna be fun all  right
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1797520,1804159,so rule number one with snowboards when  you put them down on the ground  you wanna set them down on the bindings
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1804159,1809679,because what happens if you set them  down like this and you're on a hill oh  do you slip inside
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1809679,1816720,yeah you're chasing after your snowboard  oh no okay what side do you kick a  soccer ball with right or left um
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1816720,1822960,my right all right  so that likely means you're gonna be  called regular foot there's regular foot
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1822960,1828640,and goofy foot and the difference  between those yeah goofy it's kind of  goofy yeah you know what's funny i'm
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1828640,1834000,goofy  all right so that regular foot means
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1834000,1840880,you're gonna put your left foot downhill  first when you're riding  so now i'm gonna have you put your other
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1840880,1845919,foot your right foot right here okay and  i want you to grab my hand
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1845919,1853490,i want you to scoot back and forth a  little bit just just a little bit just a  little wiggle wow see how slippery that  is it's really slippery
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1853490,1860159,[Music]  how are you doing over there blippi  you're ready
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1860159,1865200,i'm ready  [Music]
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1865200,1871600,so then i want you to do that same  scooch back and forth trill scoop scoop  scooch oh it's like i'm dancing more a
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1871600,1874799,little more a little faster
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1877519,1883919,yeah i think she's going to do great  yeah you are very much fun the most  important thing like i said before is
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1883919,1890840,knowing how to stop  yeah that's important  have you ever watched snowboarding  before yes what do they do when they
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1890840,1896080,stop uh  i don't know they go sideways oh nothing
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1896080,1902320,slightly down the hill and they don't  dig their heels in okay it's kind of  like a snow plow yeah yeah
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1902320,1907840,bend your knees a little bit  yeah okay release that edge then slide  forward
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1907840,1915200,okay heels there you go  okay right so that's how you stop you  dig your heels in cool
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1915200,1920559,wow  yeah he's good isn't he
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1920559,1926000,so now the next step is to go on your  toe side okay so what you're going to do  is you're going to rotate
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1926000,1934200,your tip down that way okay swoop around  me  [Applause]  there you go
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1935600,1941440,go sideways  whoa  that's tricky isn't it that is tricky
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1941440,1948240,let's try it again let's let's try and  slide just a little bit farther okay  toes your heels toes
2I_uO2KSA0Y,1948240,1954920,there we go that is tricky now what i  want you to do is is slide nice and  smooth sideways okay
