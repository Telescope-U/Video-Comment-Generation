t6_vawdzRok,160,2399,after four scintillating games of the
t6_vawdzRok,2399,6240,2022 finals steph curry is averaging 34
t6_vawdzRok,6240,10400,points a night on smoking hot 66 true
t6_vawdzRok,10400,13200,shooting by far his highest scoring
t6_vawdzRok,13200,16240,volume in any of the 26 playoff series
t6_vawdzRok,16240,18480,he's played in his career
t6_vawdzRok,18480,20640,and while he's added strength and
t6_vawdzRok,20640,22880,tightened his handle to deal with all
t6_vawdzRok,22880,25680,kinds of ball pressure there's a major
t6_vawdzRok,25680,28400,tactical reason why curry's scoring in
t6_vawdzRok,28400,31199,this series has blown away any of his
t6_vawdzRok,31199,33600,previous finals performances
t6_vawdzRok,33600,36000,before we get to that this game looked
t6_vawdzRok,36000,38160,like it was swinging toward the celtics
t6_vawdzRok,38160,40000,in the middle of the fourth quarter
t6_vawdzRok,40000,42160,after jalen brown scampered down the
t6_vawdzRok,42160,45520,lane for a layup to put boston up by two
t6_vawdzRok,45520,47840,on the other end curry is looking to hit
t6_vawdzRok,47840,51039,draymond on the roll but green pulls up
t6_vawdzRok,51039,53440,so brown nabs it and breaks out in
t6_vawdzRok,53440,56239,transition finishing with a fantastic
t6_vawdzRok,56239,60079,scoop layup to put boston up by five
t6_vawdzRok,60079,62160,that was the second consecutive turnover
t6_vawdzRok,62160,64000,from the warriors and a few minutes
t6_vawdzRok,64000,66720,earlier rob williams had roamed off
t6_vawdzRok,66720,70159,draymond to alter this shot green passed
t6_vawdzRok,70159,73200,on a layup to kick it out for a three
t6_vawdzRok,73200,75439,and despite more aggression from him on
t6_vawdzRok,75439,77600,the offensive end in this game the
t6_vawdzRok,77600,80159,limitations we discussed in game three
t6_vawdzRok,80159,82479,were still an issue for the golden state
t6_vawdzRok,82479,85200,offense with the celtics able to roam
t6_vawdzRok,85200,87840,off him and essentially ignore him out
t6_vawdzRok,87840,89520,on the perimeter
t6_vawdzRok,89520,93040,so steve kerr in an incredibly bold move
t6_vawdzRok,93040,95360,sent draymond to the bench and he
t6_vawdzRok,95360,97040,immediately reaped the benefits of
t6_vawdzRok,97040,99360,having all those shooters out there as
t6_vawdzRok,99360,102399,clay drives into a ton of space and
t6_vawdzRok,102399,104320,turns for a great look to cut it to
t6_vawdzRok,104320,105439,three
t6_vawdzRok,105439,107040,the celtics try to put curry in
t6_vawdzRok,107040,109040,screening action and wiggins wants to
t6_vawdzRok,109040,111280,fight over this screen so steph can
t6_vawdzRok,111280,114159,avoid the switch but tatum brilliantly
t6_vawdzRok,114159,116880,cuts back door thompson sees this
t6_vawdzRok,116880,119360,instantly and makes an incredible save
t6_vawdzRok,119360,120880,at the rim
t6_vawdzRok,120880,123119,with tatum behind the play it's a five
t6_vawdzRok,123119,126320,on four that forces boston's center to
t6_vawdzRok,126320,128479,pick up clay in transition and in a
t6_vawdzRok,128479,131120,small ball lineup that means no big men
t6_vawdzRok,131120,133599,left in the paint so wiggins can use his
t6_vawdzRok,133599,136080,size and athleticism to score on the
t6_vawdzRok,136080,137599,putback
t6_vawdzRok,137599,139920,kavon looney was out there instead of
t6_vawdzRok,139920,142319,draymond because of his size as a
t6_vawdzRok,142319,145760,finisher rebounder and as a shot blocker
t6_vawdzRok,145760,148160,at the rim closing the back door on
t6_vawdzRok,148160,150319,marcus smart here before he drops in
t6_vawdzRok,150319,153280,this wild three at the buzzer
t6_vawdzRok,153280,155680,with the lead back to four tatum does a
t6_vawdzRok,155680,157599,nice job staying with curry around the
t6_vawdzRok,157599,160400,screen pool attacks the closeout and
t6_vawdzRok,160400,162480,again it's wiggins on the offensive
t6_vawdzRok,162480,165519,glass to cut it back to two
t6_vawdzRok,165519,168560,andrew was huge in this game grabbing 11
t6_vawdzRok,168560,171599,of his 16 rebounds in the second half
t6_vawdzRok,171599,173680,and having a huge defensive presence
t6_vawdzRok,173680,175920,throughout the night forcing a tatum
t6_vawdzRok,175920,178800,kick out there and jason only made three
t6_vawdzRok,178800,181680,shots all game against wiggins with his
t6_vawdzRok,181680,184239,size and length helping him contest
t6_vawdzRok,184239,186879,these high release jumpers
t6_vawdzRok,186879,189280,this possession was a clinic with wigans
t6_vawdzRok,189280,191680,containing him in space then he's strong
t6_vawdzRok,191680,193599,enough to avoid a back down and on the
t6_vawdzRok,193599,196720,reset completely shuts him off again
t6_vawdzRok,196720,199599,he also had a few nice help possessions
t6_vawdzRok,199599,202480,switching off tatum here then lingering
t6_vawdzRok,202480,204640,in the lane and steering him into a
t6_vawdzRok,204640,208239,tough fadeaway with nothing else open
t6_vawdzRok,208239,210000,a few minutes later with the lead still
t6_vawdzRok,210000,212400,at two the celtics late game offense
t6_vawdzRok,212400,215200,stagnated again this plagued them during
t6_vawdzRok,215200,218000,the miami series so jalen tries to drive
t6_vawdzRok,218000,221120,into clay only that one rims out and
t6_vawdzRok,221120,222959,curry grabs the rebound and pushes it
t6_vawdzRok,222959,225440,down the court and then multiple celtics
t6_vawdzRok,225440,227840,converge on him in transition so he
t6_vawdzRok,227840,229760,drags them all to the left side of the
t6_vawdzRok,229760,232239,floor while clay runs into that open
t6_vawdzRok,232239,235920,space for an open three and the lead
t6_vawdzRok,235920,238959,after a brown miss curry tries to attack
t6_vawdzRok,238959,241680,robb in screening action and after smart
t6_vawdzRok,241680,244720,falls down he's left on curry island and
t6_vawdzRok,244720,247439,that's not where you want to be
t6_vawdzRok,247439,249920,this mismatch hunting has defined the
t6_vawdzRok,249920,252480,series for curry consistently attacking
t6_vawdzRok,252480,254720,boston's big men in pick and roll and
t6_vawdzRok,254720,257120,the celtics do not want their centers
t6_vawdzRok,257120,259680,dancing outside with steph
t6_vawdzRok,259680,261919,most teams around the league don't drop
t6_vawdzRok,261919,264400,their big men against curry because of
t6_vawdzRok,264400,267199,his shooting and historically all of
t6_vawdzRok,267199,269360,steph's finals opponents have trapped
t6_vawdzRok,269360,272160,him in some form to get the ball out of
t6_vawdzRok,272160,274320,his hands and pick and roll and force
t6_vawdzRok,274320,276639,his teammates to beat them
t6_vawdzRok,276639,279040,the cavs didn't always blitz him but
t6_vawdzRok,279040,280960,they did have their bigs up at the
t6_vawdzRok,280960,283120,screen to take away curry's pull up
t6_vawdzRok,283120,285520,shooting then stay with him until he
t6_vawdzRok,285520,286960,passed
t6_vawdzRok,286960,288880,sometimes they would also switch a more
t6_vawdzRok,288880,291680,mobile big man on him and then recover
t6_vawdzRok,291680,294240,as needed to help basically anything to
t6_vawdzRok,294240,296639,take away his pull up three
t6_vawdzRok,296639,299120,but the celtics have played a drop
t6_vawdzRok,299120,301120,coverage with their big man throughout
t6_vawdzRok,301120,303840,the series and this just gives curry way
t6_vawdzRok,303840,306320,too much airspace to fire within his
t6_vawdzRok,306320,308000,sweet spots
t6_vawdzRok,308000,310479,notice how rob williams is inside the
t6_vawdzRok,310479,312240,three-point line and even when he
t6_vawdzRok,312240,314880,doesn't take a three it's an uncontested
t6_vawdzRok,314880,316800,jumper in rhythm
t6_vawdzRok,316800,319440,boston has even started their drop
t6_vawdzRok,319440,322160,outside the three-point stripe but once
t6_vawdzRok,322160,324479,al horford starts backpedaling curry can
t6_vawdzRok,324479,327039,just walk into an open look
t6_vawdzRok,327039,329360,this puts a ton of pressure on steph's
t6_vawdzRok,329360,331680,defender to get through the screen and
t6_vawdzRok,331680,334240,push him downhill but even when that
t6_vawdzRok,334240,336560,works a re-screen like this is a
t6_vawdzRok,336560,338960,brutally effective counter
t6_vawdzRok,338960,341600,we saw another counter in game four with
t6_vawdzRok,341600,344160,steph rejecting the screen porford
t6_vawdzRok,344160,346000,thinks he's headed toward the middle so
t6_vawdzRok,346000,348400,he's out of position on this crossover
t6_vawdzRok,348400,351120,and curry's simply too quick for him
t6_vawdzRok,351120,353600,another trick steph has mastered is
t6_vawdzRok,353600,356560,stringing the drop out laterally horford
t6_vawdzRok,356560,358319,wants to backpedal instead of chasing
t6_vawdzRok,358319,360800,him and that creates airspace and that's
t6_vawdzRok,360800,362560,just absurd
t6_vawdzRok,362560,364479,this also factors into how steph has
t6_vawdzRok,364479,367360,defended away from the ball williams
t6_vawdzRok,367360,369759,drops off looney here so curry comes off
t6_vawdzRok,369759,372560,the screen with a ton of daylight
t6_vawdzRok,372560,374479,this ridiculous sequence in the third
t6_vawdzRok,374479,377120,quarter came against the high drop
t6_vawdzRok,377120,379600,williams is inside the line but that's
t6_vawdzRok,379600,382960,not good enough and so horford then says
t6_vawdzRok,382960,385840,i'll come out even higher on this screen
t6_vawdzRok,385840,389759,and steph says still not high enough
t6_vawdzRok,389759,392160,boston's occasionally mixed it up
t6_vawdzRok,392160,394960,horford switches onto him here and curry
t6_vawdzRok,394960,397600,blows right by him and then the issue is
t6_vawdzRok,397600,400560,who is chasing steph as he runs into the
t6_vawdzRok,400560,403680,corner for a relocation three
t6_vawdzRok,403680,405360,the celtics understand the
t6_vawdzRok,405360,407039,vulnerabilities of this defensive
t6_vawdzRok,407039,409599,approach but the drop also helps prevent
t6_vawdzRok,409599,412639,defensive breakdowns away from the ball
t6_vawdzRok,412639,414800,keeping that warrior's offense more in
t6_vawdzRok,414800,415599,check
t6_vawdzRok,415599,418000,since it's only the big men that drop
t6_vawdzRok,418000,419599,these pick and rolls can also leave
t6_vawdzRok,419599,421919,draymond standing in the corner and as
t6_vawdzRok,421919,424080,we discussed in the previous video he's
t6_vawdzRok,424080,426800,a non-factor in that spot
t6_vawdzRok,426800,428720,additionally when teams send two
t6_vawdzRok,428720,430880,defenders to curry it unleashes
t6_vawdzRok,430880,433919,draymond's short roll passing but the
t6_vawdzRok,433919,437440,drop by design takes that off the table
t6_vawdzRok,437440,439440,since the dropping defender stays
t6_vawdzRok,439440,442240,between draymond and the basket
t6_vawdzRok,442240,445680,so yes curry's scoring has been dazzling
t6_vawdzRok,445680,447520,and in particular he's lit up the
t6_vawdzRok,447520,450400,celtics big men in all four games but
t6_vawdzRok,450400,451919,that's part of the reason why draymond
t6_vawdzRok,451919,454960,was on the bench in a three-point game
t6_vawdzRok,454960,457280,late in the fourth quarter while curry
t6_vawdzRok,457280,459360,danced around to put the warriors up
t6_vawdzRok,459360,460639,three
t6_vawdzRok,460639,463599,green did have a really strong defensive
t6_vawdzRok,463599,465520,game disrupting a number of high
t6_vawdzRok,465520,468000,leverage passes which led to celtic's
t6_vawdzRok,468000,470319,turnovers and turned defense into
t6_vawdzRok,470319,471599,offense
t6_vawdzRok,471599,472560,so
t6_vawdzRok,472560,475599,with 341 left in the fourth kerr sent
t6_vawdzRok,475599,478000,green out there for his defense and
t6_vawdzRok,478000,480720,after another tatum miss over wiggins he
t6_vawdzRok,480720,483360,ingeniously called time out to sub
t6_vawdzRok,483360,486000,draymond back out of the game so he
t6_vawdzRok,486000,488319,could put poole in for offense
t6_vawdzRok,488319,490639,after the timeout the celtics switched
t6_vawdzRok,490639,492560,the pick and roll and this time horford
t6_vawdzRok,492560,494720,was able to hold his own and force a
t6_vawdzRok,494720,496960,miss out of curry but a whistle lets
t6_vawdzRok,496960,499199,kerr bring green back in for the next
t6_vawdzRok,499199,501520,defensive possession and that was
t6_vawdzRok,501520,504000,important because with brown isolating
t6_vawdzRok,504000,506639,on clay it's draymond that slides over
t6_vawdzRok,506639,508879,to help then immediately closes to the
t6_vawdzRok,508879,511599,corner to bother smart and after an
t6_vawdzRok,511599,513839,offensive rebound they work the ball
t6_vawdzRok,513839,516240,back around again to marcus and look
t6_vawdzRok,516240,518959,who's there for another contest
t6_vawdzRok,518959,521680,a minute later curry repaid derrick
t6_vawdzRok,521680,524000,white for his game one facial and
t6_vawdzRok,524000,526959,suddenly it was a six point lead
t6_vawdzRok,526959,529680,boston would have an answer after this
t6_vawdzRok,529680,532240,tatum kickout finds horford for a corner
t6_vawdzRok,532240,535680,three and then fittingly with the game
t6_vawdzRok,535680,537600,hanging in the balance the celtics
t6_vawdzRok,537600,540080,actually trapped the curry ball screen
t6_vawdzRok,540080,542320,draymond sprang free on the short roll
t6_vawdzRok,542320,544959,and found looney for a layup to ice the
t6_vawdzRok,544959,547120,game for the warriors
t6_vawdzRok,547120,549839,andrew wiggins was huge all night long
t6_vawdzRok,549839,553040,on the glass and on the defensive end
t6_vawdzRok,553040,555040,and steve kerr pressed all the right
t6_vawdzRok,555040,557279,buttons with those offense to defense
t6_vawdzRok,557279,559760,substitutions down the stretch
t6_vawdzRok,559760,562080,but it was stephen curry's sublime
t6_vawdzRok,562080,565279,shooting in route to 43 points
t6_vawdzRok,565279,569200,10 rebounds and seven made threes that
t6_vawdzRok,569200,571519,turned the tide in game four
t6_vawdzRok,571519,574000,sending the series back to the bay
