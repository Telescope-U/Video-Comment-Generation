0Drw8cR5t8s,80,2399,welcome to the studio with the new bmw 3
0Drw8cR5t8s,2399,3840,series facelift
0Drw8cR5t8s,3840,6000,the bmv dryer
0Drw8cR5t8s,6000,8400,listen and repeat bmw dryer that's the
0Drw8cR5t8s,8400,10400,german lesson for today for the bmw 3
0Drw8cR5t8s,10400,11280,series
0Drw8cR5t8s,11280,12799,and you can see here a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,12799,15360,changes from kidney but it has not grown
0Drw8cR5t8s,15360,17520,actually that is interesting but it's
0Drw8cR5t8s,17520,19680,actually you know a little bit you know
0Drw8cR5t8s,19680,22160,has the different curve here also two
0Drw8cR5t8s,22160,24400,times vertical fins this is the external
0Drw8cR5t8s,24400,26640,shadow line so you have black frame and
0Drw8cR5t8s,26640,28960,also the black inside the other base
0Drw8cR5t8s,28960,30560,versions would like a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,30560,32960,brighter this area here is higher so it
0Drw8cR5t8s,32960,35040,gives more presence on the road and the
0Drw8cR5t8s,35040,38160,very cool color here is a special m
0Drw8cR5t8s,38160,42160,color brooklyn gray so m brooklyn gray
0Drw8cR5t8s,42160,44480,astonishing right and for me most
0Drw8cR5t8s,44480,46399,important news so far the headlands had
0Drw8cR5t8s,46399,48320,had this you know this element like this
0Drw8cR5t8s,48320,49920,you know like there's this king inside
0Drw8cR5t8s,49920,52960,but here now a more seamless design also
0Drw8cR5t8s,52960,54559,here so beautiful update for the
0Drw8cR5t8s,54559,55680,headlamps
0Drw8cR5t8s,55680,58320,led standard optional matrix adaptive
0Drw8cR5t8s,58320,60480,led with curving light functions and
0Drw8cR5t8s,60480,62320,then also the signature is a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,62320,64000,more accentuated i think it's a good
0Drw8cR5t8s,64000,65680,thing and the laser light is no more but
0Drw8cR5t8s,65680,67680,you still then have in the matrix led
0Drw8cR5t8s,67680,70400,now these blue accentuations carried on
0Drw8cR5t8s,70400,73119,from the former laser light design why
0Drw8cR5t8s,73119,75200,is that manufacturers go away from laser
0Drw8cR5t8s,75200,76880,light and say i know what is knights try
0Drw8cR5t8s,76880,79360,but the matrix led have actually a
0Drw8cR5t8s,79360,81520,better price performance they have you
0Drw8cR5t8s,81520,83680,know enough performance also in high
0Drw8cR5t8s,83680,85600,beam then there were these regulations
0Drw8cR5t8s,85600,86560,issues with
0Drw8cR5t8s,86560,88960,in the u.s and they said audi and bmw
0Drw8cR5t8s,88960,91520,the hell with laser light matrix led is
0Drw8cR5t8s,91520,93759,actually just fine so i think in this
0Drw8cR5t8s,93759,96320,case here a very good upgrade as for the
0Drw8cR5t8s,96320,99200,front face for the bmw 3 series they are
0Drw8cR5t8s,99200,101840,new infotainment systems update also to
0Drw8cR5t8s,101840,104000,come and also better perforated sensor
0Drw8cR5t8s,104000,106399,tech seats so stay tuned here with
0Drw8cR5t8s,106399,108720,thomas on auto fuel for all the changes
0Drw8cR5t8s,108720,111439,to come right now let's go 4 meter 71 or
0Drw8cR5t8s,111439,114960,185 inches is the length it's
0Drw8cR5t8s,114960,117200,a little tiny bit longer because
0Drw8cR5t8s,117200,118560,the spoilers have changed a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,118560,120799,but of course no major change wheels
0Drw8cR5t8s,120799,123439,come from 17 to 20 inch wheels 18 inch
0Drw8cR5t8s,123439,125920,is standard already in the us these here
0Drw8cR5t8s,125920,128319,are the 19 inch ones 20 you could get
0Drw8cR5t8s,128319,130239,over the m performance parts but this is
0Drw8cR5t8s,130239,132080,actually a good choice optional of
0Drw8cR5t8s,132080,134560,course also the adaptive suspension is
0Drw8cR5t8s,134560,135920,available but already the base
0Drw8cR5t8s,135920,138400,suspension of a 3 series has these
0Drw8cR5t8s,138400,140879,hydraulic cushions inside the dampers
0Drw8cR5t8s,140879,142319,and here the side probably once again a
0Drw8cR5t8s,142319,144800,very clean sedan look dropping line
0Drw8cR5t8s,144800,147680,right here i think this is still a very
0Drw8cR5t8s,147680,150560,classic timeless look isn't it this
0Drw8cR5t8s,150560,152400,vehicle does have the extended shadow
0Drw8cR5t8s,152400,153680,line however
0Drw8cR5t8s,153680,156400,the black door frames are standard now
0Drw8cR5t8s,156400,159280,for all models but you can still depict
0Drw8cR5t8s,159280,161519,them and go for chrome but then you have
0Drw8cR5t8s,161519,164160,to go for that on purpose which i would
0Drw8cR5t8s,164160,166400,actually do this is a sporty look but
0Drw8cR5t8s,166400,168319,i'm more like team chrome frames around
0Drw8cR5t8s,168319,170480,the windows or are you team black frames
0Drw8cR5t8s,170480,172720,around the windows tell me the comments
0Drw8cR5t8s,172720,174319,the rear of the three series to me one
0Drw8cR5t8s,174319,176640,of the most beautiful star rears again
0Drw8cR5t8s,176640,178239,you can also get the touring the estate
0Drw8cR5t8s,178239,179920,version if you want more luggage
0Drw8cR5t8s,179920,181760,flexibility but here you can see the
0Drw8cR5t8s,181760,182879,lamps
0Drw8cR5t8s,182879,185280,swinging form beautiful clean
0Drw8cR5t8s,185280,187200,three-dimensional work the lower part in
0Drw8cR5t8s,187200,188959,the m sport you have the black contrast
0Drw8cR5t8s,188959,192000,and diffuser style as well as no job for
0Drw8cR5t8s,192000,194159,the af ap no job for the autographed
0Drw8cR5t8s,194159,196640,fake exhaust police because this is real
0Drw8cR5t8s,196640,198800,i mean you know yes there's like the
0Drw8cR5t8s,198800,200640,comment around it makes it a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,200640,202400,thicker but you see this is the actual
0Drw8cR5t8s,202400,204640,pipe and i think that's an honest design
0Drw8cR5t8s,204640,206720,isn't it as car key the standard one
0Drw8cR5t8s,206720,208959,here in the m sport with the m colors
0Drw8cR5t8s,208959,211440,and this would be then the optional
0Drw8cR5t8s,211440,213599,computer key the big one where you can
0Drw8cR5t8s,213599,215920,also have like pre-conditioning and so
0Drw8cR5t8s,215920,217440,on and so on but this one of course does
0Drw8cR5t8s,217440,219920,the job dog losing sound
0Drw8cR5t8s,219920,222319,very solid ah low frequency i love that
0Drw8cR5t8s,222319,225599,right then inside you can see here top
0Drw8cR5t8s,225599,227840,part soft touch then here also really
0Drw8cR5t8s,227840,230560,soft great build quality also nice hov

0Drw8cR5t8s,236080,237920,available for like a year or so
0Drw8cR5t8s,237920,239439,pre-facelift now they are really

0Drw8cR5t8s,246640,249599,soft great quality and also maybe in
0Drw8cR5t8s,249599,252000,black brown or beige because red is not

0Drw8cR5t8s,254560,257040,i would probably pick them in beige
0Drw8cR5t8s,257040,258799,um maybe not to this exterior color
0Drw8cR5t8s,258799,259919,maybe then the black seeds would be
0Drw8cR5t8s,259919,262079,better yeah i don't know you picked that
0Drw8cR5t8s,262079,264479,then m spot steam wheel and colors and

0Drw8cR5t8s,265919,268240,system this is kind of like big news in
0Drw8cR5t8s,268240,270400,the interior the two screens we know
0Drw8cR5t8s,270400,273479,them from other new models 12.3 left
0Drw8cR5t8s,273479,276800,14.9 on the right side and this is then

0Drw8cR5t8s,287919,289440,comfortable in the upright seating
0Drw8cR5t8s,289440,290960,position style but other than that i
0Drw8cR5t8s,290960,292800,like to control right here you have
0Drw8cR5t8s,292800,294400,really good comfort in these seats and
0Drw8cR5t8s,294400,295919,when you put them in the lowest position
0Drw8cR5t8s,295919,299040,here with one minus 89 or six or two
0Drw8cR5t8s,299040,300880,still some headphone left here is not
0Drw8cR5t8s,300880,302479,the panoramic groove in this case ben
0Drw8cR5t8s,302479,304800,but you can get one scene up down manual
0Drw8cR5t8s,304800,307520,way but very good and smooth process
0Drw8cR5t8s,307520,309280,cockpit area you can see here these
0Drw8cR5t8s,309280,311840,decoy elements clean layout then here
0Drw8cR5t8s,311840,315919,this curved screen one unit and 14.9 on

0Drw8cR5t8s,318240,321360,left in the lower area still a manual
0Drw8cR5t8s,321360,323280,volume knob here that's good the climate
0Drw8cR5t8s,323280,325199,unit is sadly gone because the climate
0Drw8cR5t8s,325199,328639,unit is in the screen now
0Drw8cR5t8s,328639,330479,yeah about that i don't like it that
0Drw8cR5t8s,330479,333360,much sumo to the software version i mean
0Drw8cR5t8s,333360,335759,at least it stays here in that same area
0Drw8cR5t8s,335759,337919,at least yeah here you can open this one
0Drw8cR5t8s,337919,339840,there's more classic adaptive cup
0Drw8cR5t8s,339840,341919,holders inductive charging android auto

0Drw8cR5t8s,347120,349280,shifting lever i mean for three series
0Drw8cR5t8s,349280,351039,it would i think still be cool to have
0Drw8cR5t8s,351039,352960,the classic one this one now of course
0Drw8cR5t8s,352960,354720,offers a cleaner look
0Drw8cR5t8s,354720,356319,but again it looks less sporty than
0Drw8cR5t8s,356319,358400,definitely and the armrest of course
0Drw8cR5t8s,358400,360000,very well attached nice leatherette
0Drw8cR5t8s,360000,361199,surface and
0Drw8cR5t8s,361199,362720,more space underneath yeah jonas

0Drw8cR5t8s,368960,371120,complete app view
0Drw8cR5t8s,371120,373759,there there are so many things to do now
0Drw8cR5t8s,373759,375840,meanwhile
0Drw8cR5t8s,375840,378080,yeah i always say that 07 delivers a
0Drw8cR5t8s,378080,380080,better overview but this one of course
0Drw8cR5t8s,380080,382400,wow more in your face
0Drw8cR5t8s,382400,384479,and you can also get the harmon carbon
0Drw8cR5t8s,384479,386479,sound system for this one which gets you
0Drw8cR5t8s,386479,388960,a very very nice crystal clear sound i
0Drw8cR5t8s,388960,390800,can really recommend it as one of my
0Drw8cR5t8s,390800,392240,favorite options especially if you're a
0Drw8cR5t8s,392240,395600,music lover than i you know just as i am
0Drw8cR5t8s,395600,397280,interesting also when we check around
0Drw8cR5t8s,397280,399680,here the visualizations are really nice
0Drw8cR5t8s,399680,401440,and
0Drw8cR5t8s,401440,403520,we can also check out
0Drw8cR5t8s,403520,405919,the map here
0Drw8cR5t8s,405919,407600,here we go
0Drw8cR5t8s,407600,409280,this is also quite responsive so the car
0Drw8cR5t8s,409280,412240,internal gps is still very well usable
0Drw8cR5t8s,412240,415039,yeah and about that climate control um
0Drw8cR5t8s,415039,417759,what is missing actually you can um you
0Drw8cR5t8s,417759,420160,know it was like in versions before
0Drw8cR5t8s,420160,423199,here you can actually also activate or
0Drw8cR5t8s,423199,425199,deactivate the ac so this has been
0Drw8cR5t8s,425199,426639,updated now so they do listen to the
0Drw8cR5t8s,426639,428479,feedback we give here on this channel
0Drw8cR5t8s,428479,430560,and that you you also give here in the
0Drw8cR5t8s,430560,432560,comments digital instruments of course
0Drw8cR5t8s,432560,435120,also all new like in the other all-new
0Drw8cR5t8s,435120,437440,bmw models and
0Drw8cR5t8s,437440,439120,you can at the right of the steering
0Drw8cR5t8s,439120,441039,wheel change them for example also the
0Drw8cR5t8s,441039,442479,layout where you want to have the
0Drw8cR5t8s,442479,445680,digital speed displayed and so on
0Drw8cR5t8s,445680,447680,head up display you can also change
0Drw8cR5t8s,447680,449759,contents there definitely always a
0Drw8cR5t8s,449759,452080,helpful option since steering wheels can
0Drw8cR5t8s,452080,454639,also block views on the instruments
0Drw8cR5t8s,454639,456720,rear seating area also perforated center
0Drw8cR5t8s,456720,459520,tanks looks really lovely
0Drw8cR5t8s,459520,461440,high quality and the seating area is
0Drw8cR5t8s,461440,464160,also quite wide actually for rear seats
0Drw8cR5t8s,464160,465919,and what about the legroom by the way
0Drw8cR5t8s,465919,468160,also soft touch at the rear seats like
0Drw8cR5t8s,468160,470160,for the premium vehicle here it fits for
0Drw8cR5t8s,470160,472560,five tall adults no pro well in this i
0Drw8cR5t8s,472560,474560,would rather say four to adults five
0Drw8cR5t8s,474560,477440,maybe long short way fits here headroom
0Drw8cR5t8s,477440,479599,wires also directly fits here with the
0Drw8cR5t8s,479599,482400,189 or six foot two well in the middle
0Drw8cR5t8s,482400,484879,part i mean you can drive for short ways
0Drw8cR5t8s,484879,486080,of course you would need to push this
0Drw8cR5t8s,486080,487440,one forward now it's a little bit
0Drw8cR5t8s,487440,489280,stiffer than here on the middle part it
0Drw8cR5t8s,489280,491520,does work but of course in this sedan
0Drw8cR5t8s,491520,494080,segment rather use the outside seats
0Drw8cR5t8s,494080,496879,here we go trunk area 480 liters if you
0Drw8cR5t8s,496879,498960,want more you need the estate or the
0Drw8cR5t8s,498960,500879,touring model here the length is a good
0Drw8cR5t8s,500879,502800,meter of 40 inches very well usable and
0Drw8cR5t8s,502800,504240,the same also
0Drw8cR5t8s,504240,506319,almost goes for the width and the height
0Drw8cR5t8s,506319,507280,here at
0Drw8cR5t8s,507280,510400,53 centimeters or 21 inches and as for
0Drw8cR5t8s,510400,511599,engines
0Drw8cR5t8s,511599,514360,we know rather unchanged however more
0Drw8cR5t8s,514360,517120,electrification for the engines and
0Drw8cR5t8s,517120,520159,diesel petrol plug and hybrid four and
0Drw8cR5t8s,520159,523760,six cylinders ranging from 150 to 374
0Drw8cR5t8s,523760,527200,horsepower excluding the true m3 which
0Drw8cR5t8s,527200,529120,one is the best to go for the most fun
0Drw8cR5t8s,529120,531519,yes the m340i
0Drw8cR5t8s,531519,533760,the six liner this one here is the 330i
0Drw8cR5t8s,533760,536560,the four cylinder but my personal tip
0Drw8cR5t8s,536560,539279,would be 340i of course since no when
0Drw8cR5t8s,539279,541839,money plays no the six cylinder and you
0Drw8cR5t8s,541839,544000,don't need the m3 really the 340i will
0Drw8cR5t8s,544000,546080,just be fine in the us you can also get
0Drw8cR5t8s,546080,547360,it rear-wheel drive only that would be
0Drw8cR5t8s,547360,548880,the dream combination
0Drw8cR5t8s,548880,550640,for example in germany you get it then
0Drw8cR5t8s,550640,552399,as alway drive but that's of course you
0Drw8cR5t8s,552399,555200,know yeah that thing that goes best
0Drw8cR5t8s,555200,557120,action is most fun
0Drw8cR5t8s,557120,558320,really great also with the new
0Drw8cR5t8s,558320,560160,perforated sensor tech seats and i
0Drw8cR5t8s,560160,562560,really also like the front changes well
0Drw8cR5t8s,562560,564080,what about the competitors of the three
0Drw8cR5t8s,564080,566640,series we also have reviews of that so
