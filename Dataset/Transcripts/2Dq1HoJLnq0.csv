2Dq1HoJLnq0,160,1280,they didn't talk about it because they
2Dq1HoJLnq0,1280,3120,thought it wasn't a life worth talking
2Dq1HoJLnq0,3120,5040,about and now we're doing this huge
2Dq1HoJLnq0,5040,7680,enormous show that apple was paying all
2Dq1HoJLnq0,7680,10080,this money to pay for about those women
2Dq1HoJLnq0,10080,12000,in those generations right
2Dq1HoJLnq0,12000,13200,there's something just
2Dq1HoJLnq0,13200,17240,it's pretty poignant i think
2Dq1HoJLnq0,18240,20720,for all of us this story felt so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,20720,22640,familiar to us not just as koreans but
2Dq1HoJLnq0,22640,23840,as humans
2Dq1HoJLnq0,23840,25439,and i think especially when you think
2Dq1HoJLnq0,25439,27279,about the last few years that we've come
2Dq1HoJLnq0,27279,28960,out of there's something about this
2Dq1HoJLnq0,28960,31599,story the honesty of it
2Dq1HoJLnq0,31599,34239,the lack of cynicism of you know just
2Dq1HoJLnq0,34239,35760,stories of people we fall in love with
2Dq1HoJLnq0,35760,38079,that i think was really powerful to my
2Dq1HoJLnq0,38079,40160,case my friend's case
2Dq1HoJLnq0,40160,42399,i'm you know i didn't research all of
2Dq1HoJLnq0,42399,45039,them but i just i wasn't suspicious
2Dq1HoJLnq0,45039,47039,about you know when i read the script
2Dq1HoJLnq0,47039,49680,there was timeline so i wasn't sure
2Dq1HoJLnq0,49680,52719,about my age i don't i don't know how
2Dq1HoJLnq0,52719,54239,the audience will
2Dq1HoJLnq0,54239,58640,adopt that timeline but it's well i
2Dq1HoJLnq0,58640,60960,think um
2Dq1HoJLnq0,60960,63280,written and it says
2Dq1HoJLnq0,63280,65760,sue did a wonderful job and all the
2Dq1HoJLnq0,65760,69280,timeline i didn't get confused my age so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,69280,71520,that she did a wonderful job when i
2Dq1HoJLnq0,71520,74560,usually watch my show and then i cannot
2Dq1HoJLnq0,74560,77280,enjoy it because uh i was just
2Dq1HoJLnq0,77280,79439,looking at myself on the screen that's
2Dq1HoJLnq0,79439,82240,very embarrassing and then i always
2Dq1HoJLnq0,82240,85280,regret about why i did that
2Dq1HoJLnq0,85280,86960,i could have done better than that or
2Dq1HoJLnq0,86960,88560,something like that so that's why i
2Dq1HoJLnq0,88560,90960,don't enjoy it most of time but this one
2Dq1HoJLnq0,90960,94000,somehow i really enjoyed other actors
2Dq1HoJLnq0,94000,96640,doing they are really doing great job
2Dq1HoJLnq0,96640,100000,all of them young sanja and little sanja
2Dq1HoJLnq0,100000,101600,and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,101600,104159,mother and father and then
2Dq1HoJLnq0,104159,106880,i just fell in love and then i cried and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,106880,109439,saw oh my goodness i became really
2Dq1HoJLnq0,109439,112079,audience so that was my feeling about
2Dq1HoJLnq0,112079,115439,this episode and i was very happy and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,115439,117840,pleased
2Dq1HoJLnq0,125520,128519,with
2Dq1HoJLnq0,152610,155689,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,160959,163120,when we took this out to buyers it was
2Dq1HoJLnq0,163120,165200,the first question everyone asked right
2Dq1HoJLnq0,165200,166800,so what language are we watching this
2Dq1HoJLnq0,166800,167760,show in
2Dq1HoJLnq0,167760,169519,and i made it very clear that it had to
2Dq1HoJLnq0,169519,171760,be in the native languages and not not
2Dq1HoJLnq0,171760,173599,none of the buyers all seven they were
2Dq1HoJLnq0,173599,175680,totally fine with that the one difficult
2Dq1HoJLnq0,175680,177280,thing about this show was because we
2Dq1HoJLnq0,177280,179599,cross-cut time periods between solomon's
2Dq1HoJLnq0,179599,182159,generation and sinja's childhood growing
2Dq1HoJLnq0,182159,184720,up we had to figure out the entire
2Dq1HoJLnq0,184720,186159,family history
2Dq1HoJLnq0,186159,187519,so even though in the first season we
2Dq1HoJLnq0,187519,188959,don't meet you know the second
2Dq1HoJLnq0,188959,190640,generation we still need to know what
2Dq1HoJLnq0,190640,192400,happened to them because it affects when
2Dq1HoJLnq0,192400,194959,yj plays sunja she's living that past
2Dq1HoJLnq0,194959,197280,already within her bones so that was one
2Dq1HoJLnq0,197280,198720,of the challenges of it but we knew
2Dq1HoJLnq0,198720,200239,where it was going to end
2Dq1HoJLnq0,200239,201599,i mean i think that's one of the things
2Dq1HoJLnq0,201599,203120,about this show that people have to buy
2Dq1HoJLnq0,203120,204720,into which is you're meeting different
2Dq1HoJLnq0,204720,206239,characters at different timelines in
2Dq1HoJLnq0,206239,209799,different time periods
2Dq1HoJLnq0,210040,213290,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,234480,237480,um
2Dq1HoJLnq0,259519,262800,see i've been working in this industry
2Dq1HoJLnq0,262800,266080,almost 60 years they said so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,266080,267280,my age
2Dq1HoJLnq0,267280,270479,rules are all all same to me but somehow
2Dq1HoJLnq0,270479,273440,this one is very different the sanja's
2Dq1HoJLnq0,273440,274720,character
2Dq1HoJLnq0,274720,277199,so i'm not sure i read the script first
2Dq1HoJLnq0,277199,279919,or novel first but i read both and then
2Dq1HoJLnq0,279919,282240,i felt immediate and immediate
2Dq1HoJLnq0,282240,284639,connection to sanja
2Dq1HoJLnq0,284639,288639,uh her honesty and her strength just
2Dq1HoJLnq0,288639,291280,to survive and her determination to
2Dq1HoJLnq0,291280,294080,survive but so that was very i wanted to
2Dq1HoJLnq0,294080,296479,play this role i felt like i had to play
2Dq1HoJLnq0,296479,298880,this role that is very rare feeling
2Dq1HoJLnq0,298880,301199,nowadays what we learned so much in this
2Dq1HoJLnq0,301199,304560,production is combine the us process
2Dq1HoJLnq0,304560,306080,with the korean process and they're very
2Dq1HoJLnq0,306080,308400,very different i think i cared so much
2Dq1HoJLnq0,308400,310639,about sunja that it took a really long
2Dq1HoJLnq0,310639,312960,time for me to think about like how do
2Dq1HoJLnq0,312960,315919,we how do we win her life now yj is a
2Dq1HoJLnq0,315919,317840,legend right and she's a little bit
2Dq1HoJLnq0,317840,319919,intimidating i'll be honest when she
2Dq1HoJLnq0,319919,324560,said to me i am sanja and i know sanja
2Dq1HoJLnq0,325640,335820,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,336880,337890,a
2Dq1HoJLnq0,337890,341029,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,346110,349388,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,413280,415440,you know these women are 100 years old
2Dq1HoJLnq0,415440,417039,they have lived through
2Dq1HoJLnq0,417039,419440,they've lived through history right they
2Dq1HoJLnq0,419440,421360,when you look at what those women
2Dq1HoJLnq0,421360,423840,have seen and what they experienced
2Dq1HoJLnq0,423840,426080,my life will be nothing like what i have
2Dq1HoJLnq0,426080,427440,seen in my life is going to be nothing
2Dq1HoJLnq0,427440,429680,compared to those women and yet the
2Dq1HoJLnq0,429680,432160,thing that i found so amazing was they
2Dq1HoJLnq0,432160,434560,thought they had small lives right that
2Dq1HoJLnq0,434560,436400,woman at the end she says thank you for
2Dq1HoJLnq0,436400,438400,listening to my boring story
2Dq1HoJLnq0,438400,440800,and it's so shocking because it's
2Dq1HoJLnq0,440800,442720,anything but boring they didn't talk
2Dq1HoJLnq0,442720,443919,about it because they thought it wasn't
2Dq1HoJLnq0,443919,446160,a life worth talking about and now we're
2Dq1HoJLnq0,446160,448720,doing this huge enormous show that apple
2Dq1HoJLnq0,448720,451039,was paying all this money to pay for
2Dq1HoJLnq0,451039,452960,about those women in those generations
2Dq1HoJLnq0,452960,453840,right
2Dq1HoJLnq0,453840,455919,it's pretty poignant i think we are very
2Dq1HoJLnq0,455919,459440,grateful to having this story and then
2Dq1HoJLnq0,459440,462319,i'm really really honored
2Dq1HoJLnq0,462319,464960,to honor their their family story with
2Dq1HoJLnq0,464960,468720,apple so i'm very grateful apple
2Dq1HoJLnq0,468720,470960,for that
2Dq1HoJLnq0,470960,472000,yes
2Dq1HoJLnq0,472000,474639,otherwise nobody would understand or
2Dq1HoJLnq0,474639,478720,what happened in a small country in asia
2Dq1HoJLnq0,478720,483199,but you did a wonderful job really so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,483199,486720,oh thank you thank you
2Dq1HoJLnq0,486720,488720,and people like us we don't need to walk
2Dq1HoJLnq0,488720,492360,in our family's shadows
2Dq1HoJLnq0,500160,503160,foreign
2Dq1HoJLnq0,504140,507220,[Music]
2Dq1HoJLnq0,508720,510800,so season two we jumped to world war two
2Dq1HoJLnq0,510800,512719,years so it's the two boys growing up
2Dq1HoJLnq0,512719,514479,someone the best of years and the worst
2Dq1HoJLnq0,514479,516000,of years right so we get to see that in
2Dq1HoJLnq0,516000,518240,their brotherhood aside from the sinja
2Dq1HoJLnq0,518240,519919,and hansu's romance we have like one of
2Dq1HoJLnq0,519919,522640,my favorite romances in the book coming
2Dq1HoJLnq0,522640,525640,up
2Dq1HoJLnq0,539600,543040,me being an actor when i have a script
2Dq1HoJLnq0,543040,545680,then i tried that was like a mission
2Dq1HoJLnq0,545680,548399,that is like mission to me so i'll try
2Dq1HoJLnq0,548399,550240,to portray sanjay
2Dq1HoJLnq0,550240,553120,and then since she did wonderful job
2Dq1HoJLnq0,553120,555120,because that uh
2Dq1HoJLnq0,555120,557839,when she get old i mean sanja
2Dq1HoJLnq0,557839,560320,her perspective watching them you know
2Dq1HoJLnq0,560320,563920,the time line was different and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,563920,567279,that was very brilliant job she did and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,567279,568160,so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,568160,569279,i
2Dq1HoJLnq0,569279,571519,whatever she write i would try to do my
2Dq1HoJLnq0,571519,575200,best for her or for the story i'm the
2Dq1HoJLnq0,575200,578399,part of the story that's my mission so
2Dq1HoJLnq0,578399,580720,no she will do the great job i'm sure
2Dq1HoJLnq0,580720,584000,this is burdening but
2Dq1HoJLnq0,584320,587279,yes but yj gave me two rules she says
2Dq1HoJLnq0,587279,589200,you cannot write two things these are
2Dq1HoJLnq0,589200,591440,two things i will never do or can i are
2Dq1HoJLnq0,591440,592880,we allowed to say what the two things
2Dq1HoJLnq0,592880,595200,you said she said you cannot write i
2Dq1HoJLnq0,595200,599120,will not dance and i will not sing
2Dq1HoJLnq0,601760,606640,that dialogue was i think um
2Dq1HoJLnq0,611279,612959,i was talking to
2Dq1HoJLnq0,612959,616480,solomon about in the hospital i think
2Dq1HoJLnq0,616480,619360,while we were waiting that word
2Dq1HoJLnq0,619360,621360,she was very meaningful
2Dq1HoJLnq0,621360,622399,and
2Dq1HoJLnq0,622399,626560,as a grandmother that was the lesson
2Dq1HoJLnq0,626560,627680,she got
2Dq1HoJLnq0,627680,629760,through her life so sanjay was very
2Dq1HoJLnq0,629760,633040,brave and then honest that's why i would
2Dq1HoJLnq0,633040,637519,admire her the sanjay the character
2Dq1HoJLnq0,642959,644880,that was a good line i love that line
2Dq1HoJLnq0,644880,646880,cheetos but i also love the rooftop
2Dq1HoJLnq0,646880,648480,scene with salomon when she gives
2Dq1HoJLnq0,648480,651440,solomon the watch
2Dq1HoJLnq0,651440,653680,and i really love that scene when she
2Dq1HoJLnq0,653680,655360,says i used to think this watch was a
2Dq1HoJLnq0,655360,657279,curse upon her family but now i see that
2Dq1HoJLnq0,657279,659760,it once saved us i really like the way
2Dq1HoJLnq0,659760,663800,she did that line a lot
2Dq1HoJLnq0,678720,680800,you
