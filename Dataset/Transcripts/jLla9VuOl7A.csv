jLla9VuOl7A,125,1802,- I wanna be a pickle girl so bad.
jLla9VuOl7A,1802,4146,"Only hot girls like pickles, and I'm like damn it,"
jLla9VuOl7A,4146,6480,"I don't like pickles, I'm not a hot girl. (laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,6480,9262,"- (PvF) Celebrities are often held to higher standards,"
jLla9VuOl7A,9262,12431,but even they love to let go and indulge in some weird foods
jLla9VuOl7A,12431,13746,every once in a while.
jLla9VuOl7A,13746,15029,- Oooh! - Oh!
jLla9VuOl7A,15029,17564,"- And they're like I know, it's kinda crazy,"
jLla9VuOl7A,17564,19362,and it's like no... - I'm so quirky!
jLla9VuOl7A,19363,20396,- Exactly! (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,20396,21210,- (PvF) Today we're gonna try
jLla9VuOl7A,21210,22825,"these celebrities' weirdest food combinations,"
jLla9VuOl7A,22826,24494,and you'll have to guess whose it is.
jLla9VuOl7A,24494,25778,"- Okay, that's simple. - This is just fun!"
jLla9VuOl7A,25778,28660,- I might just change my whole perspective on somebody.
jLla9VuOl7A,28660,31151,- Bruh! (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,31151,34343,- Um... What is this?
jLla9VuOl7A,34343,35843,- (PvF) Up first we have a pizza sandwich
jLla9VuOl7A,35844,37978,with chili and noodles in the middle.
jLla9VuOl7A,37978,40226,"- That's got some weight to it, bruh! - Yeah!"
jLla9VuOl7A,40226,43280,- Try to be dainty about this. - I'm not.
jLla9VuOl7A,43280,44645,Good luck with that!
jLla9VuOl7A,44645,46711,"- I mean, it tastes really good. - Tastes good."
jLla9VuOl7A,46711,49010,- It tastes exactly what you'd think it tastes like.
jLla9VuOl7A,49010,50694,"- You know, I really like this. - Yeah."
jLla9VuOl7A,50694,52294,- This is really good.
jLla9VuOl7A,52294,55261,- I could see like anyone training for a Marvel movie doing this.
jLla9VuOl7A,55262,57761,"- There's so many different  textures, but it works!"
jLla9VuOl7A,57761,59610,- It's literally giving four year old.
jLla9VuOl7A,59610,63577,"- Cheese, noodles, bread, garlic. - Spaghetti!"
jLla9VuOl7A,63577,65253,- Spaghetti. - Chili!
jLla9VuOl7A,65253,66431,- Carbs! - I like the pepperoni.
jLla9VuOl7A,66431,68144,- I feel like a man would come up with this.
jLla9VuOl7A,68144,69509,"- I'm gonna go, for sure, a dude."
jLla9VuOl7A,69510,72227,- There's no way a woman does this. (both laugh)
jLla9VuOl7A,72227,77047,"- (PvF) Alright, is it A, John Cho, B, Jennifer Lawrence,"
jLla9VuOl7A,77047,79355,"or C, Pete Davidson?"
jLla9VuOl7A,79356,80394,(bell rings)
jLla9VuOl7A,80394,81091,- Oh!
jLla9VuOl7A,81092,84279,"- Pete Davidson's from New York, so he's gotta like pizza, right?"
jLla9VuOl7A,84279,86611,- I think Pete too. (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,86611,89779,- I just am immediately crossing out J-Law.
jLla9VuOl7A,89779,93194,"- Three, two, one. I went with B."
jLla9VuOl7A,93194,95862,- I don't know why I felt like I needed to write his whole name out.
jLla9VuOl7A,95862,97780,- I just wrote Pete. (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,97780,101179,- I put Pete Davidson. - Oh.
jLla9VuOl7A,101179,103312,- I don't know where she's from. - Neither do I.
jLla9VuOl7A,103312,104629,- She comes off as quirky.
jLla9VuOl7A,104629,106229,- (PvF) This is Jennifer Lawrence. (buzzer rings)
jLla9VuOl7A,106229,107211,- Oh! - What?
jLla9VuOl7A,107211,109064,"- Aw, what? - Are you serious?"
jLla9VuOl7A,109065,110663,"- Oh yeah, yeah yeah,  yeah yeah yeah!"
jLla9VuOl7A,110663,111446,- We did it!
jLla9VuOl7A,111446,114378,- Well she's kinda like  keepin' it real.
jLla9VuOl7A,114378,115530,- (PvF) Jennifer Lawrence  has never been one
jLla9VuOl7A,115530,117345,to deny herself the food that she loves.
jLla9VuOl7A,117345,119561,"She put the concoction together completely sober,"
jLla9VuOl7A,119561,121578,"and totally sober, in her own words. - Right."
jLla9VuOl7A,121579,123678,- I've always kinda liked her.
jLla9VuOl7A,123678,125779,- I always liked her too. - That doesn't surprise me.
jLla9VuOl7A,125779,130095,"- Uh, whoa! - Okay."
jLla9VuOl7A,130095,132678,"- Oh, bruh! - Oh!"
jLla9VuOl7A,132679,133695,Cheetos!?
jLla9VuOl7A,133695,136379,"- (PvF) Next, we have an interesting combo, PB&J with Cheetos."
jLla9VuOl7A,136379,137746,- Oh. - The crunch!
jLla9VuOl7A,137746,139130,The crunch!
jLla9VuOl7A,139130,140952,- I'm terrified. (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,140952,142344,"- You know what, yeah, it's not weird."
jLla9VuOl7A,142344,144512,It's like having chips on the side.
jLla9VuOl7A,144512,146043,"- If you ever had Lay's potato chips in here,"
jLla9VuOl7A,146043,147540,now that... (clicks tongue)
jLla9VuOl7A,147540,149338,"- I'm, I don't know, I'm just gonna go in."
jLla9VuOl7A,149339,151842,"- This is like what something a little kid would make at lunch time,"
jLla9VuOl7A,151842,153799,"'cause they got their little bag of Cheetos, and..."
jLla9VuOl7A,153800,155811,"- To me, this is more, just putting your chips in here,"
jLla9VuOl7A,155811,158009,it's more of a time saver. - Mm-hmm.
jLla9VuOl7A,158776,160814,"I'm telling you, it looks impressive,"
jLla9VuOl7A,160814,162196,but gruesome at the same time.
jLla9VuOl7A,162196,163667,- It kinda just tastes like peanut butter and jelly
jLla9VuOl7A,163667,164743,with a little bit of a crunch.
jLla9VuOl7A,164743,166493,- This is really crazy to me. This is good.
jLla9VuOl7A,166493,167523,- I don't like it though. (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,167523,168855,- I don't like it either.
jLla9VuOl7A,168855,170532,"- I love this, I don't have any complaints."
jLla9VuOl7A,170532,174728,"- (PvF) Is it A, Mr. Channing Tatum, B, Adele."
jLla9VuOl7A,174728,176179,- Ooh!
jLla9VuOl7A,176179,177779,"- (PvF) Or C, Britney Spears?"
jLla9VuOl7A,177779,180144,"- I don't know these, I'm taking a wild guess."
jLla9VuOl7A,180144,181145,- Or Channing.
jLla9VuOl7A,181145,182678,"- (PvF) Again, you're gonna write your answers on your board."
jLla9VuOl7A,182678,183829,- Oh. - C.
jLla9VuOl7A,183829,186179,Oh my God! (both laugh)
jLla9VuOl7A,186179,188045,- And I have A. - I have A too.
jLla9VuOl7A,188045,189879,- It's Britney [censored]! - It's Britney [censored]!
jLla9VuOl7A,189879,191675,"- Hey, we both wrote it! Yay!"
jLla9VuOl7A,191675,193199,"- It's a whole little meal. - Yes,"
jLla9VuOl7A,193199,195486,and she grew up humble at first.
jLla9VuOl7A,195486,196478,- (PvF) It is Channing Tatum.
jLla9VuOl7A,196478,197732,- Yay! - Ooh!
jLla9VuOl7A,197732,199331,"- Yes, we slayed!"
jLla9VuOl7A,199331,200379,- Dang it! - Man!
jLla9VuOl7A,200380,201800,- Ugh! (buzzer rings)
jLla9VuOl7A,201800,204115,"- Oh my gosh, when did he like admit to this?"
jLla9VuOl7A,204115,206464,"- (PvF) Channing Tatum gave the recipe in a Reddit AMA,"
jLla9VuOl7A,206464,208417,calling it the perfect sandwich.
jLla9VuOl7A,208417,210365,"He said it was essential  to have white bread,"
jLla9VuOl7A,210365,212515,"extra grape flavored jelly,"
jLla9VuOl7A,212515,214688,and the peanut butter must be creamy.
jLla9VuOl7A,214688,215711,- Perfect?
jLla9VuOl7A,215711,218435,- (laughs) Perfect is not a word that pops into my mind.
jLla9VuOl7A,218435,220804,"- But I mean, shout out to you, Channing."
jLla9VuOl7A,220804,222023,- You weirdo.
jLla9VuOl7A,222023,224040,- That does give me a whole  new perspective
jLla9VuOl7A,224040,225659,"on Channing Tatum, for sure. (Danny laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,225660,226890,- Ooh! - Absolutely not.
jLla9VuOl7A,226890,228634,"- Banana, don't tell me  that's ketchup."
jLla9VuOl7A,228634,230624,- (PvF) This next item  is bananas and ketchup.
jLla9VuOl7A,230624,233523,"- I'm not eating this, Nicole. (Danny laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,233523,236355,"- I wanna know who made this, so I can yell at them!"
jLla9VuOl7A,236355,238841,- (laughs) I'm trembling.
jLla9VuOl7A,238841,241121,"- Here we go, three, two, one."
jLla9VuOl7A,241121,242776,"- Three, two, one!"
jLla9VuOl7A,244412,246130,"- Mm, mm-mm. - Mm-mm!"
jLla9VuOl7A,246130,247663,"- Mm-mm! - Mm, mm-mm."
jLla9VuOl7A,247663,249254,- It's not great.
jLla9VuOl7A,249254,252144,"- So here's the thing, in Filipino cuisine,"
jLla9VuOl7A,252144,253858,we have this thing called banana ketchup.
jLla9VuOl7A,253858,255028,- Mm-hmm. - It's not this.
jLla9VuOl7A,255028,255940,(both laugh)
jLla9VuOl7A,255940,257458,"- Okay, when the ketchup hits your tongue,"
jLla9VuOl7A,257458,259700,"you're like oh no! - Yeah, no, no no no!"
jLla9VuOl7A,259700,260708,"- Sorry, sorry."
jLla9VuOl7A,260709,262942,- (PvF) This combo isn't doing it for you?
jLla9VuOl7A,262942,266084,"- No, what? What'd you say? (laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,266084,268724,- This low key could be like a pregnancy craving though.
jLla9VuOl7A,268724,269770,- No no no no no!
jLla9VuOl7A,269770,271124,"- This was a joke, nobody's actually serious about this."
jLla9VuOl7A,271124,271801,- Yeah.
jLla9VuOl7A,271801,275719,- I'm about to have a few choice words with whoever came up with this one!
jLla9VuOl7A,275719,276796,- Ah! (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,276796,279367,"- (PvF) Is it A, Taye Diggs."
jLla9VuOl7A,279368,282302,"- Okay, well... - (PvF) B, Beyonce,"
jLla9VuOl7A,282302,284485,"or C, Awkwafina."
jLla9VuOl7A,284485,286318,- This better not be Beyonce.
jLla9VuOl7A,286318,290152,- (laughs) It is not Beyonce. - I hope not!
jLla9VuOl7A,290152,292344,"- Oh my gosh, it's Awkwafina. - Oh my God, okay."
jLla9VuOl7A,293765,295133,- Awkwafina.
jLla9VuOl7A,295133,296714,- I'm gonna go with Awkwafina. - Mm-hmm.
jLla9VuOl7A,296714,298379,- This better not be Beyonce.
jLla9VuOl7A,298380,301716,"- I'm just going with Beyonce, just because it's a funny guess."
jLla9VuOl7A,301716,303615,"- It's gonna be Beyonce, if it's Beyonce,"
jLla9VuOl7A,303615,305397,"seriously, I'm out, I'm out! - I would start crying!"
jLla9VuOl7A,305398,307697,I would start crying!
jLla9VuOl7A,307697,309647,- (PvF) It is Beyonce. - No! (laughs)
jLla9VuOl7A,309647,311515,"- No, no! - Oh!"
jLla9VuOl7A,311515,313480,- (gasps) Are you okay? (bell rings)
jLla9VuOl7A,313480,315548,Do you need to unpack what you're feeling right now?
jLla9VuOl7A,315548,317717,"- Beyonce, why!? (laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,317717,319397,"- (PvF) During Beyonce's first pregnancy,"
jLla9VuOl7A,319397,321298,rumors from her catering staff began to spread
jLla9VuOl7A,321298,323630,that she was requesting some truly strange food combinations
jLla9VuOl7A,323630,325432,including dipping bananas in ketchup.
jLla9VuOl7A,325432,326872,"- Okay, she was pregnant, never mind."
jLla9VuOl7A,326872,328563,"- Yeah, okay, it's fine. - We love you."
jLla9VuOl7A,328563,330331,"- She was pregnant, with who, with Blue?"
jLla9VuOl7A,330331,332280,- Someone would serve this and be like it's a fruit salad!
jLla9VuOl7A,332280,335113,"Tomato's a fruit, and then you would never invite that friend"
jLla9VuOl7A,335113,337803,to the potluck ever again.
jLla9VuOl7A,337803,339994,- What is this?
jLla9VuOl7A,339994,340900,- What is this? - What is that?
jLla9VuOl7A,340900,341971,- It doesn't look weird.
jLla9VuOl7A,341971,343291,- It does too look weird.
jLla9VuOl7A,343291,345650,- (sniffs) That smells funky.
jLla9VuOl7A,345650,346764,- What is that? - Pickles.
jLla9VuOl7A,346764,347885,- What's on top of this?
jLla9VuOl7A,347885,349473,"- Ooh, zucchini?"
jLla9VuOl7A,349473,350617,- (PvF) You gonna try it first?
jLla9VuOl7A,350617,351584,- What is it?
jLla9VuOl7A,351584,352534,- I don't wanna put anything
jLla9VuOl7A,352534,355400,"I don't know what it is  in my mouth, Nicole."
jLla9VuOl7A,355400,357016,- She's not gonna tell us until we eat it.
jLla9VuOl7A,357016,358246,Oh my God.
jLla9VuOl7A,358246,362294,- (laughs) Om. - Mm.
jLla9VuOl7A,362294,363701,"- Okay, yeah."
jLla9VuOl7A,365278,366629,"Oh, mm-hmm."
jLla9VuOl7A,366629,367734,- I don't like it.
jLla9VuOl7A,367734,369902,"- That's good! - Is it, okay."
jLla9VuOl7A,370901,373771,"- What is it, I don't... - The taste is familiar,"
jLla9VuOl7A,373771,376094,but I can't put my finger on it. What is that?
jLla9VuOl7A,376094,377035,- Zucchini?
jLla9VuOl7A,377035,378469,- (PvF) This is a unique  take on pasta.
jLla9VuOl7A,378469,381736,Zucchini mushed with water and bouillon cubes.
jLla9VuOl7A,381736,383668,- I thought it would be grosser. It looks grosser.
jLla9VuOl7A,383668,386372,"- Okay, I was afraid it would be something crazy."
jLla9VuOl7A,386372,387252,- Yeah.
jLla9VuOl7A,387252,388693,"- It's a no from me, I'll stick to my red sauce."
jLla9VuOl7A,388693,389802,"- I really like it, Sharon."
jLla9VuOl7A,389803,391099,"You don't like it? - It's a no from me, mm-mm."
jLla9VuOl7A,391099,392120,It's a no for me.
jLla9VuOl7A,392120,394869,"- It's like baby paste, when they mush vegetables,"
jLla9VuOl7A,394869,396901,"and they're like here you go, baby! - Yeah, I don't like it. (laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,396902,398718,- (PvF) Whose do you think it is?
jLla9VuOl7A,398718,401785,"A, Zooey Deschanel, B, Rihanna,"
jLla9VuOl7A,401786,403646,"or C, Meghan Markle?"
jLla9VuOl7A,403646,404536,- Ugh!
jLla9VuOl7A,404536,406035,- That's why I'm saying it's hard. - You know why I'm guessing this?
jLla9VuOl7A,406035,408186,I'm guessing it just so  I can write that.
jLla9VuOl7A,408186,410897,- I love Miss Meghan Markle.
jLla9VuOl7A,410897,412702,"- Alright. - Three, two, one."
jLla9VuOl7A,412702,415172,"A, we gotta stop! (laughs)"
jLla9VuOl7A,415172,417273,- Rihanna.
jLla9VuOl7A,417273,419888,- Miss Meghan Markle for some reason.
jLla9VuOl7A,419888,423221,- I kinda got surprised and thrown off for the Beyonce one.
jLla9VuOl7A,423221,424588,"Very classy woman,"
jLla9VuOl7A,424588,427272,"Rihanna is a very classy, respectable woman."
jLla9VuOl7A,427272,428938,"- (PvF) It is C, Meghan Markle. (buzzer rings)"
jLla9VuOl7A,428938,430504,"- Aw, well man."
jLla9VuOl7A,430505,432456,(bell rings) - Ugh!
jLla9VuOl7A,432456,434171,"- (gasps) I don't know how I thought of that,"
jLla9VuOl7A,434171,435539,but I was just like... - Go Miss Meghan!
jLla9VuOl7A,435539,437189,- (PvF) Meghan's go-to  pasta sauce recipe
jLla9VuOl7A,437189,440122,"consists of slow-cooked zucchini,  water, and a little bouillon."
jLla9VuOl7A,440122,443372,"She describes it as a filthy, sexy mush."
jLla9VuOl7A,444717,445788,- I like that.
jLla9VuOl7A,445788,447022,- She even knows it's a mush.
jLla9VuOl7A,447022,448488,"- Filthy, sexy, mush! - So..."
jLla9VuOl7A,448488,451072,- Three interesting words to put together
jLla9VuOl7A,451072,452505,when you're describing food.
jLla9VuOl7A,452505,455206,- I feel like mush and sexy just don't go together.
jLla9VuOl7A,455206,456805,Maybe I'm old school!
jLla9VuOl7A,456805,459606,"- Okay, popcorn, it's giving, whoa!"
jLla9VuOl7A,459606,461706,"- Why is it dripping? - What is on here, oh hot sauce."
jLla9VuOl7A,461706,464505,- (PvF) How about popcorn with Tabasco and pickle juice on top?
jLla9VuOl7A,464506,467239,"- More than most things in this world,"
jLla9VuOl7A,467239,469723,one thing I hate is wet popcorn.
jLla9VuOl7A,469723,471263,- Hell yeah! - That's hot.
jLla9VuOl7A,471263,472455,- Uh huh!
jLla9VuOl7A,472455,475228,"- I mean, (gags) it's wet!"
jLla9VuOl7A,475228,477438,"- I don't even mind, it's soggy, but I love it."
