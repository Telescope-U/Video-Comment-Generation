yNxXsnBcIDo,1180000,1186559,it's really old  [Music]  we're pouring some paint on our palette  instead of getting directly from the
yNxXsnBcIDo,1186559,1192740,buckets because we don't want our  buckets of paint to dry it will be a lot  of wasted paint
yNxXsnBcIDo,1192740,1200080,[Music]  here's some blue  here's some green
yNxXsnBcIDo,1200080,1208919,and here's some white  okay now you can start painting bug

yNxXsnBcIDo,1243440,1250320,and a darker shade of blue for my ocean  [Music]  you did a great job bug
yNxXsnBcIDo,1250320,1255679,now to add details we're going to paint  using these cotton buds instead of your
yNxXsnBcIDo,1255679,1263440,brushes  the art technique we're going to do is  called that painting now watch me to
yNxXsnBcIDo,1263440,1271600,paint one of this mountain then you can  do the rest in your own  i will do one green mountain so first i
yNxXsnBcIDo,1271600,1277600,prepare all the paint i need  we use this shade of green so i'll start
yNxXsnBcIDo,1277600,1285200,from here  i'm pouring around one tablespoon of  paint in each hole of my muffin pan
yNxXsnBcIDo,1285200,1292880,then i add a bit of yellow on this  second one  and a little more on the third one
yNxXsnBcIDo,1292880,1297919,on the port one i'll make it pure yellow
yNxXsnBcIDo,1298240,1303869,now we mix this all up  [Music]
yNxXsnBcIDo,1307280,1312720,as you can see we have four colors for  one mountain since this is a daytime
yNxXsnBcIDo,1312720,1318480,the lightest color which is the yellow  goes on top  just dip your cotton buds in your paint
yNxXsnBcIDo,1318480,1325280,and make a lot of dots around your  outline on the top of your heels  this will be the highlight because the
yNxXsnBcIDo,1325280,1331679,top of our heels are closer to the  bright sky  it's very easy but you need a lot of
yNxXsnBcIDo,1331679,1337440,patience because this can be very tiring  wow that looks so cool i'm gonna try the
yNxXsnBcIDo,1337440,1344320,next color which is light green sure  your thing  dot dot dot
yNxXsnBcIDo,1344320,1351799,dot this is so easy i like this  glad you're enjoying this
yNxXsnBcIDo,1353540,1377280,[Music]
yNxXsnBcIDo,1377280,1383120,these dots look so nice on my tree it  makes it look more leafy
yNxXsnBcIDo,1383430,1389200,[Music]  time to mix the blue shades for the  ocean

yNxXsnBcIDo,1767520,1775120,our muddy clay and start massaging it  oh i think i have to get half
yNxXsnBcIDo,1775120,1781120,half as much better than too much yeah  because you have smaller hands  after massaging the clay i shape it into
yNxXsnBcIDo,1781120,1786799,a cone  then place it at the center of your  wheel let's switch it on
yNxXsnBcIDo,1786799,1792399,then with your hands first to soften the  frame  [Music]  it's kind of hard to control because i
yNxXsnBcIDo,1792399,1797760,can't press it down  i'll make it faster
yNxXsnBcIDo,1798010,1806080,[Applause]  [Music]  now i'm going to form the hole of my pot

yNxXsnBcIDo,1862559,1868480,how mine turned out  now we'll use this nylon thread to  remove it safely from the pottery wheel
yNxXsnBcIDo,1868480,1875279,well this came with the toy too isn't  that convenient all we have to do is  slide it under
yNxXsnBcIDo,1875279,1880720,there  it's like flossing  crossing
yNxXsnBcIDo,1880720,1887760,just make sure that the nylon thread is  flat on the wheel so that there won't be  any holes on your pot
yNxXsnBcIDo,1889679,1897600,okay come on  it's so hard i don't want to ruin it
yNxXsnBcIDo,1901360,1905480,did it  yes
yNxXsnBcIDo,1909679,1915279,yeah  okay  we're gonna let it dry here for two days

yNxXsnBcIDo,2011120,2015640,okay i'm gonna do the other layer
yNxXsnBcIDo,2018320,2023480,it looks so big it's not itching to be  smaller
yNxXsnBcIDo,2047440,2054079,it's a bit heavy because i used a lot of  clay  so we made a total of five clay figures
yNxXsnBcIDo,2054079,2059520,we're going to let it dry for two days  so we'll see you guys around when it's  dry

yNxXsnBcIDo,2133130,2140560,[Music]
yNxXsnBcIDo,2140560,2146480,in case you guys want to do pottery  especially if it's your first time you  should always buy extra clay because the
yNxXsnBcIDo,2146480,2153920,amount of clay that comes with this toy  is usually not enough like this toy only  gave enough clay for two small pots and
yNxXsnBcIDo,2153920,2159599,when you're just starting to learn  pottery you will make a lot of mistakes  and waste a lot of clay
yNxXsnBcIDo,2159599,2166720,yeah when i first started i wet the clay  too much that i couldn't mold it anymore  so guys don't forget to buy extra clay
yNxXsnBcIDo,2166720,2178988,it's cheap anyway  [Music]
yNxXsnBcIDo,2179119,2184960,i'm almost done with my donut i'm just  going to add the sprinkles wow i love  sprinkles
