pp-zw4ykOpw,7880,9400,"- Hello, and welcome to the channel."
pp-zw4ykOpw,9400,10920,Now you guys have been asking us
pp-zw4ykOpw,10920,13050,to test air fryers for ages.
pp-zw4ykOpw,13050,15500,"So today we have teamed up with Instant Brands,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,15500,17350,"who have sent us one of their machines,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,17350,20395,and challenged us to create an epic five course meal
pp-zw4ykOpw,20395,22200,using your suggestions.
pp-zw4ykOpw,22200,23640,So myself and the food team
pp-zw4ykOpw,23640,24830,have had a proper play
pp-zw4ykOpw,24830,26210,with this for a few weeks
pp-zw4ykOpw,26210,27119,"to get to grips with it,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,27120,28960,"but, today's the first time"
pp-zw4ykOpw,28960,31490,that our normal home cooks are getting their hands on it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,31490,33700,- Five courses in one video?
pp-zw4ykOpw,33700,36000,- Five courses in one meal sounds about right.
pp-zw4ykOpw,38018,40583,(upbeat music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,40583,42410,"I'm just gonna use my ""chef-y"" intuition"
pp-zw4ykOpw,42410,44310,and say pané station.
pp-zw4ykOpw,44310,46240,- [Ben] Yep. So we're gonna make croquettes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,46240,48950,"So Spanish in approach and method,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,48950,51030,but we're gonna mix up the flavors
pp-zw4ykOpw,51030,53469,to use some other global influences.
pp-zw4ykOpw,53470,55390,You've got a béchamel sauce in front of you
pp-zw4ykOpw,55390,57840,which is really thick and then cooled.
pp-zw4ykOpw,57840,60750,- [Jamie] That's a shortcrust pastry. (laughs)
pp-zw4ykOpw,60750,62320,- [Ben] Divide it by two.
pp-zw4ykOpw,62320,65730,"So put half into the big bowl with two other flavors,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,65730,67580,charred corn and jalapeno.
pp-zw4ykOpw,67580,69530,And then the remaining half can be mixed
pp-zw4ykOpw,69530,72000,with dukkah and sultana.
pp-zw4ykOpw,72000,73940,- I've never handled a béchamel sauce.
pp-zw4ykOpw,73940,75517,- No. (laughs)
pp-zw4ykOpw,75517,76610,"- [Ben] And once you've done that,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,76610,77810,"we're gonna double pané them,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,77810,79990,so back through egg and breadcrumbs.
pp-zw4ykOpw,79990,83126,The reason being they're going to have the cooking
pp-zw4ykOpw,83126,85560,"in the air fryer across eight minutes,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,85560,89040,rather than maybe three or four in a deep fat fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,89040,91780,And therefore they'll have chance to expand the heat up.
pp-zw4ykOpw,91780,92640,You don't want 'em to pop.
pp-zw4ykOpw,92640,94270,So it's gonna give you the extra bit of security.
pp-zw4ykOpw,94270,95549,"While you're finishing off your balls,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,95550,98310,"if one of you have got a relatively clean hand,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,98310,101420,you can preheat the air fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,101420,104808,"So select air fryer, 205 degrees, eight minutes"
pp-zw4ykOpw,104808,107119,on one of the drawers and then just sync cook.
pp-zw4ykOpw,107120,108760,And it'll automatically put the second drawer
pp-zw4ykOpw,108760,110496,at exactly the same.
pp-zw4ykOpw,110496,111490,When it gets the temperature.
pp-zw4ykOpw,111490,112759,It will tell you to load the drawers.
pp-zw4ykOpw,112760,114527,"You can put one flavor in one drawer,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,114527,116060,and one flavor in the other.
pp-zw4ykOpw,116060,118352,- This is completely alien to me.
pp-zw4ykOpw,118352,120170,I've never used an air fryer before.
pp-zw4ykOpw,120170,122200,I hear about it everywhere.
pp-zw4ykOpw,122200,124309,So I'm still trying to work it out.
pp-zw4ykOpw,124309,126539,"- Yeah, I've never air fried before."
pp-zw4ykOpw,126539,129393,- [Ben] So essentially it's a heating element at the top.
pp-zw4ykOpw,129393,133600,And then a fan that pushes that hot air down onto the food.
pp-zw4ykOpw,133600,135575,"So it tends to cook quicker,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,135575,138620,but it's not submersed in the oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,138620,139970,So it's a little bit healthier.
pp-zw4ykOpw,139970,143220,"One flavor in one drawer, give them an oil spray,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,143220,145570,and the other flavor in the other drawer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,145570,147770,"- So they're going on a rack that's raised,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,147770,149030,"they're like in the middle of the oven,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,149030,150069,so they get air all around.
pp-zw4ykOpw,150070,152660,- Yeah. So the the fan is basically gonna spray
pp-zw4ykOpw,152660,154940,and circulate that hot air.
pp-zw4ykOpw,154940,158340,- And then it automatically starts timing down.
pp-zw4ykOpw,158340,159209,"- While you're waiting for it,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,159210,161360,you can make a super simple dip.
pp-zw4ykOpw,161360,162590,"- Oh, hello!"
pp-zw4ykOpw,162590,163810,"- So you could make a dip,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,163810,165540,or you could get some chefs to put all the ingredients
pp-zw4ykOpw,165540,167560,in a bowl on I'm guessing we are going to...
pp-zw4ykOpw,167560,168920,"- We're gonna make a five course meal,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,168920,170330,and I don't wanna be here all day.
pp-zw4ykOpw,170330,171350,I know what you two are like.
pp-zw4ykOpw,171350,173750,"So what you've got is yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,173750,175770,"lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper."
pp-zw4ykOpw,175770,176830,- Stir your own dip!
pp-zw4ykOpw,176830,177760,You stir the dip!
pp-zw4ykOpw,177760,179189,- [Ben] The perfect dip that will work
pp-zw4ykOpw,179190,181271,with both charred corn and jalapeño
pp-zw4ykOpw,181271,183200,and our sultana and dukkah.
pp-zw4ykOpw,183200,185520,- Get a nice sense of achievement there.
pp-zw4ykOpw,185520,186518,- [Ben] Yeah.
pp-zw4ykOpw,186518,189471,- (laughing)
pp-zw4ykOpw,189471,192989,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,192990,194140,- [Ben] Serve them up.
pp-zw4ykOpw,194140,195057,- [Barry] That was not a lot of time
pp-zw4ykOpw,195057,197190,and they are very hot and crispy.
pp-zw4ykOpw,197190,198960,- [Jamie] (laughter)
pp-zw4ykOpw,198960,200700,"- [Ben] Garnish with some fresh herbs,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,200700,202344,and you got your dipping sauce to go.
pp-zw4ykOpw,202344,205844,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,214762,215594,- Cheers
pp-zw4ykOpw,215595,216428,- Cheers
pp-zw4ykOpw,219340,220310,- Woo
pp-zw4ykOpw,220310,222910,- That béchamel has gone lovely and gooey.
pp-zw4ykOpw,222910,224267,- [Ben] Gooey on the béchamel.
pp-zw4ykOpw,224267,225663,I can hear the crunch.
pp-zw4ykOpw,227010,230780,- [Jamie] That's got the magic combo of gooey middle
pp-zw4ykOpw,230780,232476,and crispy outside.
pp-zw4ykOpw,232476,233472,I'm a fan of that.
pp-zw4ykOpw,233473,235447,"- As a five course meal, we're off to a banging start."
pp-zw4ykOpw,235447,237360,I just realized we're gonna eat every course when
pp-zw4ykOpw,237360,238193,we go along.
pp-zw4ykOpw,238193,239579,"- Yeah, you don't have to eat all of every course."
pp-zw4ykOpw,239580,241071,- We are!
pp-zw4ykOpw,241071,245190,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,245190,247060,- So one of the suggestions
pp-zw4ykOpw,247060,249374,was that a toasted cheese sandwich
pp-zw4ykOpw,249374,251506,or a grilled cheese works wonders in an air fry.
pp-zw4ykOpw,251506,252340,- Ooh yes!
pp-zw4ykOpw,252340,254069,- [Ben] And there was also people saying they used them
pp-zw4ykOpw,254070,255510,just to reheat things.
pp-zw4ykOpw,255510,258350,"So we thought, let's combine the two"
pp-zw4ykOpw,258350,260120,with French onion soup.
pp-zw4ykOpw,260120,260953,"So in this instance,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,260953,263180,you're gonna use the drawers for different things.
pp-zw4ykOpw,263180,265470,"Drawer one is going to be on reheat,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,265470,268050,"140 degrees Celsius,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,268050,271129,and drawer number two is gonna be on bake
pp-zw4ykOpw,271130,273750,at 160 for six minutes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,273750,276666,So variable control and variable temperatures.
pp-zw4ykOpw,276666,278810,"And in the reheat drawer,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,278810,281160,you're gonna spoon your French onion soup
pp-zw4ykOpw,281160,284690,into your dishes and reheat them whilst you bake the croûtes
pp-zw4ykOpw,284690,285930,in the other side.
pp-zw4ykOpw,285930,287246,- Obviously we've got a fancy air fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,287247,290530,That's got dual drawers in it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,290530,292730,"Would you just do this one after the other,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,292730,294490,"these processes, if you had a standard,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,294490,295323,single-drawer one?
pp-zw4ykOpw,295323,296680,- [Ben] Yeah. The fact that this has kind of got
pp-zw4ykOpw,296680,297910,"the six cooking functions,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,297910,300210,essentially it's adjusting the temperature
pp-zw4ykOpw,300210,301419,at which it operates.
pp-zw4ykOpw,301420,302890,So for the reheat lower temperature
pp-zw4ykOpw,302890,303760,you can reheat your soup.
pp-zw4ykOpw,303760,305590,"Then you can, once it's up to temperature,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,305590,307030,you could bake off your croûtes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,307030,309576,"And finally, once both of those are done,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,309576,312098,"grate the cheese, add it onto the croûte,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,312098,313539,"add the croûte onto the soup,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,313540,317370,and then grill at a higher temperature for less time.
pp-zw4ykOpw,317370,320610,- Onions have been reheated.
pp-zw4ykOpw,320610,322389,- [Ben] And the beauty about this particular dish
pp-zw4ykOpw,322390,324640,is it now goes soggy on the bottom from the onion soup
pp-zw4ykOpw,324640,326120,"and kind of crispy around the edges,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,326120,328660,but also the molten cheese that we love
pp-zw4ykOpw,328660,330450,of a grilled cheese on top.
pp-zw4ykOpw,330450,333302,And then we're going to grill it at 200.
pp-zw4ykOpw,333302,336280,"And whilst we wait, we can make a lovely French salad to go"
pp-zw4ykOpw,336280,338870,"with it, which is cornichon all chopped up,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,338870,340530,"mixed with mustard, vinegar,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,340530,343120,and then toss that through with some fresh watercress.
pp-zw4ykOpw,343120,345540,- [Barry] This grill is like mega intense.
pp-zw4ykOpw,345540,347180,"The thing with my like oven at home,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,347180,350077,it takes a while to grill to heat up.
pp-zw4ykOpw,350077,353796,"And it's a big oven, and that's not a very big dish."
pp-zw4ykOpw,353796,355970,It seems to be more focused.
pp-zw4ykOpw,355970,358030,- Focused. And obviously you've got the fan
pp-zw4ykOpw,358030,360393,which is pushing the hot air directly onto it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,363851,366121,- That does look a little bit special.
pp-zw4ykOpw,366121,367521,- It does.
pp-zw4ykOpw,367521,371021,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,377525,378413,- [Ben] Dig in
pp-zw4ykOpw,378413,379246,- [Jamie] Oh!
pp-zw4ykOpw,379246,382403,"- [Barry] Oh, cheesy onion goodness."
pp-zw4ykOpw,383720,384740,- Oh
pp-zw4ykOpw,384740,386630,- Stunning.
pp-zw4ykOpw,386630,389400,- I love French onion soup because
pp-zw4ykOpw,389400,391803,"the richness and the indulgence of it,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,391803,394310,the beefiness and the cheesiness.
pp-zw4ykOpw,394310,398120,So don't have soup and a grilled cheese on the side.
pp-zw4ykOpw,398120,400010,- Cook a grilled cheese in your soup.
pp-zw4ykOpw,400010,401410,- Yes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,401410,402520,- Happy?
pp-zw4ykOpw,402520,404069,- Did you eat my crouton?
pp-zw4ykOpw,404070,405150,- Was that yours?
pp-zw4ykOpw,405150,408367,"I, sorry. (laughs)"
pp-zw4ykOpw,408368,411868,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,420100,422370,"- Nibbles, soup course."
pp-zw4ykOpw,422370,423878,- Fish course.
pp-zw4ykOpw,423878,425020,- Ooh.
pp-zw4ykOpw,425020,426440,- [Ben] Really excited for this one.
pp-zw4ykOpw,426440,429430,This is combining lots of different suggestions.
pp-zw4ykOpw,429430,432070,It's gonna start with roasting asparagus.
pp-zw4ykOpw,432070,434970,So preheat one of the drawers to roast
pp-zw4ykOpw,434970,437400,at 200 degrees Celsius for six minutes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,437400,441112,"And as soon as it's preheated, you can whack the asparagus."
pp-zw4ykOpw,441112,443460,All you need to do is give it a quick spritz
pp-zw4ykOpw,443460,446130,of oil and they'll roast in there in six minutes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,446130,447260,Super simple.
pp-zw4ykOpw,447260,449110,"So it's pretty good for roasting all sorts of veg,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,449110,450800,but there was one suggestion for
pp-zw4ykOpw,450800,452107,barbecue seasoned asparagus.
pp-zw4ykOpw,452107,453600,And what I thought was
pp-zw4ykOpw,453600,456210,I quite like the idea of doing asparagus
pp-zw4ykOpw,456210,459723,but we're gonna mix up the flavors to take it to India.
pp-zw4ykOpw,460950,461783,- Okay.
pp-zw4ykOpw,461783,463612,- [Ben] Because the second suggestion was
pp-zw4ykOpw,463613,465870,something like fish fingers.
pp-zw4ykOpw,465870,469710,So we're gonna make ourselves Indian-inspired fish fingers
pp-zw4ykOpw,469710,473449,"by taking salmon, coating it in egg white and corn flour,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,473450,477170,and then dipping it into smashed up Bombay mix.
pp-zw4ykOpw,477170,478960,"- [Barry] And I'm guessing, does the Bombay mix almost"
pp-zw4ykOpw,478960,482690,like protect the fish from the heat a bit more then?
pp-zw4ykOpw,482690,484120,"- Yes. And in the same breath,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,484120,485949,don't forget it's already been fried.
pp-zw4ykOpw,485950,487220,So whereas the first course
pp-zw4ykOpw,487220,490000,we had dry breadcrumbs that we had to spray with oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,490000,491912,"Anything you buy, that's already been fried,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,491912,494860,"fish fingers, chicken nuggets, chicken dippers,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,494860,497060,anything that's already been fried
pp-zw4ykOpw,497060,501020,is ideal in here because the fat on the thing sizzles.
pp-zw4ykOpw,501020,502069,- Are we just doing a single dip?
pp-zw4ykOpw,502069,504380,"- [Ben] Yep. Single dip on this, just to coat it."
pp-zw4ykOpw,504380,506700,And then you can preheat your second drawer to air fry.
pp-zw4ykOpw,506700,510146,"205 degree Celsius, four minutes."
pp-zw4ykOpw,510146,511900,- 205 feels really hot.
pp-zw4ykOpw,511900,514930,- 205 is definitely hotter than if you were doing oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,514930,517529,"You would have it at maybe 180, 190 at a push."
pp-zw4ykOpw,517530,519570,Before you start getting to a smoke point of oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,519570,521140,"Here you've got the fierce heat, which is why"
pp-zw4ykOpw,521140,522417,four minutes is enough.
pp-zw4ykOpw,524920,525839,- [Barry] Look at that.
pp-zw4ykOpw,525840,527972,- [Ben] Give it a little sort of mix up on the plate
pp-zw4ykOpw,527972,530634,with some of that aubergine pickle.
pp-zw4ykOpw,530634,531683,- [Barry] What you doing?
pp-zw4ykOpw,531683,533782,- He said... (laughs)
pp-zw4ykOpw,533782,535334,- [Ben] I just kind of meant just zhoosh it up!
pp-zw4ykOpw,535335,538120,- I've just zhooshed it up!
pp-zw4ykOpw,538120,540016,- [Ben] To cut through the oily fish
pp-zw4ykOpw,540017,542588,"and the spice of the pickle, a little yogurt raita."
pp-zw4ykOpw,542588,546040,"You've got cucumber, fresh mint, all the ingredients there."
pp-zw4ykOpw,546040,547953,Zhooshy-zhoosh.
pp-zw4ykOpw,547953,549080,- Oh!
pp-zw4ykOpw,549080,551753,"- [Ben] And with a bit of luck, four minutes at 205,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,551753,555279,we should have bain que which means literally just cooked.
pp-zw4ykOpw,555280,558253,So you have the salmon inside that's just on the edge.
pp-zw4ykOpw,559370,560203,- He's got it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,560203,561970,No!! Oh it's great.
pp-zw4ykOpw,561970,564290,- [Ben] Why did you sound so surprised?
pp-zw4ykOpw,564290,565341,- Teamwork!
pp-zw4ykOpw,565341,566424,- Look at us!

pp-zw4ykOpw,578900,582589,"- Oh, you've just got a little bit of...here we go."
pp-zw4ykOpw,582589,584513,"- Right, what you reckon?"
pp-zw4ykOpw,584513,585860,- Oh!
pp-zw4ykOpw,585860,588190,"- As you said Ebbers, perfectly al dente."
pp-zw4ykOpw,588190,589040,Cheers.
pp-zw4ykOpw,592860,594350,- We've panéed with bread crumb.
pp-zw4ykOpw,594350,596009,We've panéed with crisps.
pp-zw4ykOpw,596010,598760,Why have we never panéed with Bombay mix before?
pp-zw4ykOpw,598760,599920,- Does all the hard work for you.
pp-zw4ykOpw,599920,601160,"And because it's already been fried,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,601160,604879,it is a wonderful even golden brown in the fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,604880,607780,And I think the asparagus roasting is super quick.
pp-zw4ykOpw,607780,608613,And then you can toss it
pp-zw4ykOpw,608613,610680,through any dressing for the summer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,610680,613230,"- Well, it's nice, but you got little charred black bits."
pp-zw4ykOpw,613230,614360,And usually it takes quite a long time
pp-zw4ykOpw,614360,615397,in oven to get that char.
pp-zw4ykOpw,615397,618310,"And by that point, they sometimes can be quite dry."
pp-zw4ykOpw,618310,620013,- Fancy a meat course?
pp-zw4ykOpw,620013,622415,- Thought you'd never ask?
pp-zw4ykOpw,622415,625980,(upbeat electronic music plays)
pp-zw4ykOpw,625980,627690,"- [Ben] So we're thinking roast chicken,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,627690,630660,"roast potatoes, and a romesco sauce."
pp-zw4ykOpw,630660,634021,"Start with a romesco, roast setting 205 degrees"
pp-zw4ykOpw,634021,635760,eight minutes in drawer one.
pp-zw4ykOpw,635760,637090,"And then if you push sync function,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,637090,639000,it'll just copy paste it across.
pp-zw4ykOpw,639000,640430,"While it's preheating,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,640430,643180,you can halve and de-seed your peppers.
pp-zw4ykOpw,643180,644080,We've done some of them for you.
pp-zw4ykOpw,644080,645620,- You said some of them; you mean all of them but one.
pp-zw4ykOpw,645620,647200,- All of them but one.
pp-zw4ykOpw,647200,648313,- All right.
pp-zw4ykOpw,648313,649146,See if you can get it done before it preheats.
pp-zw4ykOpw,649146,652370,"- [Jamie] Not falling for your little game, Ebbers."
pp-zw4ykOpw,652370,653804,- [Ben] So once it's preheated and asks
pp-zw4ykOpw,653804,655100,"you to add in your food,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,655100,658069,"we're basically gonna add half the peppers into each drawer,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,658070,661290,a spritz of oil on both and then cook them.
pp-zw4ykOpw,661290,662714,"So in those eight minutes,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,662714,665440,"we should get some nice roasted peppers,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,665440,668110,"and halfway through, it's obviously gonna remind you,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,668110,669550,in case you want to turn it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,669550,671870,You might wanna take it out and shake it.
pp-zw4ykOpw,671870,673080,"You can rip up the bread,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,673080,677270,because essentially once those peppers have roasted
pp-zw4ykOpw,677270,680030,"you are going to add in the bread, the almonds,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,680030,682270,"the garlic for another two minutes of roasting,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,682270,684770,and then you can tip it all out into your bowl
pp-zw4ykOpw,684770,686010,"and blitz in the stick blender,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,686010,688440,along with olive oil and sherry vinegar.
pp-zw4ykOpw,688440,689620,"Once we've done our sauce,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,689620,691680,we are gonna use the drawers to do two different things.
pp-zw4ykOpw,691680,693860,Chicken thighs in one
pp-zw4ykOpw,693860,697138,and roasted rosemary potatoes in the other.
pp-zw4ykOpw,697138,697971,- Yes!
pp-zw4ykOpw,697971,700150,- [Ben] So different times and temperatures for each.
pp-zw4ykOpw,700150,702513,"You can oil, salt, and pepper your spuds."
pp-zw4ykOpw,704950,705783,- [Barry] Oh yes!
pp-zw4ykOpw,705783,707747,- [Ben] The machine's gonna do some maths for you.
pp-zw4ykOpw,707747,709577,"- It's your dream, isn't it."
pp-zw4ykOpw,709577,714180,"- [Ben] So drawer one, set to roast at 180, for 25 minutes."
pp-zw4ykOpw,714180,716050,That's gonna be for your potatoes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,716050,721050,"And drawer two, set to air fry at 205 for 20 minutes."
pp-zw4ykOpw,721120,723040,"So different functions,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,723040,725360,different temperatures and different times.
pp-zw4ykOpw,725360,728600,If you now push sync finished and then push start.
pp-zw4ykOpw,728600,731250,- Okay. So one is starting before the other.
pp-zw4ykOpw,731250,733470,So they're both finished the exact same time.
pp-zw4ykOpw,733470,734303,- [Ben] Yeah.
pp-zw4ykOpw,734303,735136,- Nice!
pp-zw4ykOpw,735136,737380,"- [Ben] And it knows how long it's gonna take to preheat,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,737380,739950,"so when drawer one is preheated enough,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,739950,741570,it'll tell you to add your potatoes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,741570,743830,It'll also remind you to shake them halfway through.
pp-zw4ykOpw,743830,745980,It'll also start drawer two
pp-zw4ykOpw,745980,747550,at the right time to get to the right temperature
pp-zw4ykOpw,747550,749279,to tell you to put your second thing in.
pp-zw4ykOpw,749280,750700,"And again, to turn it halfway."
pp-zw4ykOpw,750700,752670,"Now in your second drawer,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,752670,757209,"when it is ready, you're just gonna put four chicken thighs."
pp-zw4ykOpw,757210,758300,So many people said
pp-zw4ykOpw,758300,760950,you've got to do chicken wings in an air fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,760950,761800,And we did do them.
pp-zw4ykOpw,761800,763250,"They're absolutely brilliant,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,763250,766319,"but not ideal for this dish to serve this way,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,766319,767959,but the same logic.
pp-zw4ykOpw,767960,771041,"- We're not adding any other seasonings, any flavors?"
pp-zw4ykOpw,771041,772980,"- You can season the skin if you wish,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,772980,774050,but essentially no added oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,774050,775990,Cause you're using the natural fat from the chicken skin.
pp-zw4ykOpw,775990,777410,"So something like a chicken wing,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,777410,779600,anything that's already got that fat.
pp-zw4ykOpw,779600,781220,All we need to do is keep an eye on the machine.
pp-zw4ykOpw,781220,782670,"Cause it'll tell you when to add stuff,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,782670,784696,when to turn over or toss stuff.
pp-zw4ykOpw,784697,788000,"But in the meantime, six tablespoons oil and two tablespoons"
pp-zw4ykOpw,788000,790380,of sherry vinegar into your roasted stuff
pp-zw4ykOpw,790380,791773,and blitz to a sauce.
pp-zw4ykOpw,794210,795310,Machines beeping at you.
pp-zw4ykOpw,795310,797370,"- [Barry] Hello? Add food, add food"
pp-zw4ykOpw,798255,799655,- [Ben] Get your chicken in.
pp-zw4ykOpw,802500,803500,"Last minute, cooking,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,803500,806520,toss your rosemary in with your potatoes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,806520,809260,"- Personally, the thing that appeals to me"
pp-zw4ykOpw,809260,810760,is the size of that.
pp-zw4ykOpw,810760,813683,"Like, especially if I was just cooking a small meal"
pp-zw4ykOpw,813683,815766,"for Austin, like just one of those"
pp-zw4ykOpw,815767,817290,I cook a whole meal with that for him.
pp-zw4ykOpw,817290,818123,- [Jamie] Yeah.
pp-zw4ykOpw,818123,819226,- [Barry] And it's done.
pp-zw4ykOpw,819226,820080,And he eats separately to us sometimes as well.
pp-zw4ykOpw,820080,820913,- [Jamie] Yeah.
pp-zw4ykOpw,820913,823450,"- Number four, a midweek roast, done."
pp-zw4ykOpw,823450,824283,- It's pretty easy.
pp-zw4ykOpw,824283,826613,"- That was, that was the easier so far."
pp-zw4ykOpw,826613,827751,- Wow.
pp-zw4ykOpw,827752,831252,(Upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,841900,842830,- I remember we used to share out the food
pp-zw4ykOpw,842830,845380,so that people on the side got to eat some too.
pp-zw4ykOpw,845380,846470,I missed that.
pp-zw4ykOpw,846470,848079,- You haven't done any cooking.
pp-zw4ykOpw,848080,849690,Yeah. You haven't done any cooking.
pp-zw4ykOpw,849690,850840,- [Ben] Dig in
pp-zw4ykOpw,850840,851673,- [Barry] Bang.
pp-zw4ykOpw,851673,852722,- [Jamie] Mm.
pp-zw4ykOpw,853570,854510,"- I mean, it's simple food"
pp-zw4ykOpw,854510,856740,"but it's simple food done well, right?"
pp-zw4ykOpw,856740,857573,- [Barry] There's not much better in the world
pp-zw4ykOpw,857573,859222,than a roast potato.
pp-zw4ykOpw,860830,863250,"- [Jamie] Op see there you go, juices everywhere"
pp-zw4ykOpw,863250,865620,"- Woah! Yeah, the is juicy"
pp-zw4ykOpw,865620,866990,- That was so simple.
pp-zw4ykOpw,866990,868980,"- That was, this is all chicken flavor."
pp-zw4ykOpw,868980,870070,Nothing else.
pp-zw4ykOpw,870070,872210,- The most complicated thing we did on that plate
pp-zw4ykOpw,872210,873380,isn't on the plate.
pp-zw4ykOpw,873380,874260,It was the sauce.
pp-zw4ykOpw,874260,875910,And I'd be happy just to serve that chicken
pp-zw4ykOpw,875910,876743,and potatoes
pp-zw4ykOpw,876743,877576,- Some mayonnaise.
pp-zw4ykOpw,877576,878409,- Mayonnaise.
pp-zw4ykOpw,878409,880200,I wouldn't even make it Ebbers
pp-zw4ykOpw,880200,881033,It was coming straight
pp-zw4ykOpw,881033,884280,from the squeezy bottle and that would be perfect.
pp-zw4ykOpw,884280,886823,- And that's why we have normals and why we have chefs.
pp-zw4ykOpw,891330,893150,- How sweet are we going Ebbers?
pp-zw4ykOpw,893150,895620,- So many comments suggested donuts
pp-zw4ykOpw,895620,896940,have to be tried in air fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,896940,898500,"Cause if you're doing fried food,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,898500,900140,donuts is a classic dessert.
pp-zw4ykOpw,900140,901620,But rather than bobbing around in oil
pp-zw4ykOpw,901620,902453,we're gonna do them here.
pp-zw4ykOpw,902453,904880,So you've got a dough it's already been kneaded
pp-zw4ykOpw,904880,907610,and proved once you can cut out little disks.
pp-zw4ykOpw,907610,910339,"So this is an enrich dough, close to brioche."
pp-zw4ykOpw,910340,913120,"In this instance, we're gonna cut out little discs."
pp-zw4ykOpw,913120,916110,And the second proof happens in the machine.
pp-zw4ykOpw,916110,919310,- This is the first recipe so far where I'd say I
pp-zw4ykOpw,919310,923400,would never even attempt to make this in a traditional oven.
pp-zw4ykOpw,923400,924820,It had to be fried.
pp-zw4ykOpw,924820,927170,"- [Ben] The machine has a dehydrate function, which is great"
pp-zw4ykOpw,927170,930279,for like sliced fruit or half cherry tomatoes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,930280,933430,You can basically dry your own bits and pieces
pp-zw4ykOpw,933430,935950,but we are gonna use it as a proving drawer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,935950,936850,- So hang on a second.
pp-zw4ykOpw,936850,940079,This isn't like a proving function.
pp-zw4ykOpw,940080,942310,- [Ben] It's that proving temperature at 54.
pp-zw4ykOpw,942310,943143,You'll kill the yeast.
pp-zw4ykOpw,943143,945660,You wanna take it down to as low as it go about 35.
pp-zw4ykOpw,945660,946639,So what you've got there
pp-zw4ykOpw,946640,950190,are ones that we have pre-proved in the draw already.
pp-zw4ykOpw,950190,951180,You can see the difference
pp-zw4ykOpw,951180,955350,between the unproved and the very pillowy proved ones.
pp-zw4ykOpw,955350,956550,"Now, two things are gonna happen"
pp-zw4ykOpw,956550,960052,"in draw one, preheat to air fry for your donut."
pp-zw4ykOpw,960052,962950,"So 205 degree Celsius, four minutes."
pp-zw4ykOpw,962950,967020,"And in draw two, you're going to do a reheat function"
pp-zw4ykOpw,967020,969570,120 degrees Celsius for eight minutes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,969570,970810,"You're gonna mix white chocolate,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,970810,972730,marshmallow and whipping cream.
pp-zw4ykOpw,972730,975440,This is gonna be an excellent dipping sauce.
pp-zw4ykOpw,975440,976650,- [Barry] This feels naughty
pp-zw4ykOpw,976650,978240,- [Jamie] It does feel really naughty
pp-zw4ykOpw,978240,982180,- [Ben] But because it's going in a gentle reheat function
pp-zw4ykOpw,982180,984860,"it's slowly gonna melt the chocolate, melt the marshmallows"
pp-zw4ykOpw,984860,986829,"the cream, and then we can stir it all together,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,986830,987720,once it's done.
pp-zw4ykOpw,987720,990040,"And in draw one, once you've preheated"
pp-zw4ykOpw,990040,992100,you're going to very carefully lift
pp-zw4ykOpw,992100,995284,"up and pop your donuts onto the rack, spray them."
pp-zw4ykOpw,995284,997160,And then they'll need four minutes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,997160,1001287,And this will be the big difference really between donut
pp-zw4ykOpw,1001288,1003943,and brioche because it's a sweet and
pp-zw4ykOpw,1003943,1006440,rich dough and you're gonna cook it in the air fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1006440,1008923,You need to add some oil to the top
pp-zw4ykOpw,1008923,1012610,so that you get some sizzle and even golden brown.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1012610,1014800,We've also given you some caster sugar and some cinnamon
pp-zw4ykOpw,1014800,1016029,"which you can combine,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1016030,1018760,cause the moment those donuts are done
pp-zw4ykOpw,1018760,1021530,you're gonna wanna toss them in the cinnamon sugar.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1021530,1025510,"- Hey, Ooh."
pp-zw4ykOpw,1025510,1027030,Well okay.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1027030,1027863,- [Ben] Straight into the sugar
pp-zw4ykOpw,1027863,1028696,while it's nice and hot
pp-zw4ykOpw,1028696,1029529,"zhoosh, zhoosh, zhoosh"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1029529,1031182,and get your next four in Baz
pp-zw4ykOpw,1031182,1033032,- [Barry] They look more like dough balls.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1034897,1038397,(Upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,1044982,1046097,"- Oh s**t, sorry."
pp-zw4ykOpw,1046097,1047586,- (laughter)
pp-zw4ykOpw,1047586,1048860,Sorry Ebbers.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1048860,1050940,- [Ben] Donuts and dippy sauce.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1050940,1052690,- [Barry] Tell you what cause he is been so lovely.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1052690,1053523,This whole video.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1053523,1054820,Should we give him a donut?
pp-zw4ykOpw,1054821,1055721,- I'm gonna say no
pp-zw4ykOpw,1057862,1061445,(upbeat electronic music)
pp-zw4ykOpw,1073310,1074310,- [Ben] Have a dunk.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1076010,1076843,Can I have one?
pp-zw4ykOpw,1076843,1078720,"I've been, I've been so patient all this..."
pp-zw4ykOpw,1078720,1079553,Yes.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1080610,1085559,- [Jamie] So the outside of the donut is not as crisp
pp-zw4ykOpw,1085560,1087840,as it would be if it had been fried
pp-zw4ykOpw,1087840,1089299,in the traditional manner
pp-zw4ykOpw,1089300,1090650,it's a slightly different texture
pp-zw4ykOpw,1090650,1095250,but the inside is just as fluffy as you'd want it to be.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1095250,1098680,- And I'm not even gonna start to presume that these
pp-zw4ykOpw,1098680,1100180,or anything we've done today
pp-zw4ykOpw,1100180,1102040,is healthy inverted comments
pp-zw4ykOpw,1102040,1105434,"but it is using like 95% less oil, which also"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1105434,1108120,means you haven't got that vat of oil.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1108120,1110540,You have to get rid of once it's been used
pp-zw4ykOpw,1110540,1114209,"- Before doing this, I assumed air fryer was a replacement"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1114209,1116304,for a deep fat fryer.
pp-zw4ykOpw,1116304,1119427,"Actually today, the ones that have jumped out to me are the"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1119427,1123230,the chicken and the asparagus in terms
pp-zw4ykOpw,1123230,1125828,of I can relate that can intense direct heat
pp-zw4ykOpw,1125828,1128014,from a fan and get in that char
pp-zw4ykOpw,1128014,1133014,"and keeping that tender juices inside as well, smart"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1133020,1136770,"- The peppers from the romesco sauce,"
pp-zw4ykOpw,1136770,1137880,how quickly they cooked
